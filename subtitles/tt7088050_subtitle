00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:34,479
Weather forecast:
Storm warning.

4
00:01:34,559 --> 00:01:39,079
Originating from an adolescent
ocean in low love pressure,

5
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,680
clouds of desire shall form.

6
00:01:41,719 --> 00:01:44,599
The thunderstorm shall be accompanied
by heavy rains in the heart.

7
00:01:44,639 --> 00:01:49,319
Winds of desire shall blow strongly.
The hearts may be uprooted.

8
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,400
A few older beings may also
be seen under umbrellas.

9
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:56,439
So, beautiful women have been advised
not to go out in the streets.

12
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:28,239
- Hey, are you studying here?
- You go, idiot

13
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:30,799
Hey, how dare you flirting your teacher?

14
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,000
- Hi, Abhi!
- Hi.

15
00:04:40,039 --> 00:04:42,400
- Have you eaten?
- Oh, yes. I ate so much.

16
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,400
You've finished your lunch, too?

17
00:04:45,239 --> 00:04:46,799
What happened?

18
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,520
- Someone's spat bubblegum on the road.
- That's how it is in our town.

19
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,880
Let's go.

20
00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:54,799
Abhi, quick!
Run!

21
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:57,520
Sandhya, the bus is leaving.
Quick!

22
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,920
Stop!
Be careful.

23
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,359
- Watch your step.
- Go in.

24
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,440
Hold on to this?

25
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,080
What's wrong?

26
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,600
- I missed my slipper.
- You did?

27
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,599
Mr. Conductor!

28
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:18,320
Mr. Conductor!

29
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,360
Hello!

30
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,360
They're calling out for you.

31
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,080
Wait up!
I'll come issue your tickets.

32
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,080
- Her slipper fell off, man.
- Wait, I'm busy here.

33
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,040
I missed my slipper.

34
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,960
- Stop the bus.
- Can't hear you.

35
00:05:31,719 --> 00:05:33,960
I missed my slipper.

36
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,160
She missed her slipper, it seems.

37
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,800
- Your slipper?
- Please pull over.

38
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,240
We didn't even pull over when
someone missed his cell phone.

39
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:41,200
Want me to stop for slippers?

40
00:05:41,239 --> 00:05:42,719
Get to work, lady.

41
00:05:43,159 --> 00:05:46,359
My father bought me those slippers.

42
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,599
Her father bought her
those slippers it seems.

43
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,719
How come I can't hear it,
but you can?

44
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,279
- I can read her lip movement.
- Lip movement?

45
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,000
Great.
Read her lips and hips.

46
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,640
But don't study, okay?
Or you'll become successful.

47
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:00,959
Please, brother.

48
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,400
Please pull over for a minute.

49
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:04,879
If you're in so much haste,
I'll pull over at the next stop.

50
00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:07,199
- Go get it then by auto
- Don't talk too much.

51
00:06:07,239 --> 00:06:08,319
Let it go.

52
00:06:08,359 --> 00:06:09,599
Keep driving!

53
00:06:20,719 --> 00:06:22,359
Oh, no!
See if he's caught in the wheel.

54
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,679
No, he barely missed it.

55
00:06:23,719 --> 00:06:25,440
He's fallen outside.

56
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,479
He escaped!

57
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,400
Fine, let it go.

58
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,200
Krishnaswamy College Bus Stop!

59
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,080
You're looking for something?

60
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,320
Did you see a missing slipper here?

61
00:07:15,359 --> 00:07:17,039
- A new slipper?
- No, old one.

62
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:20,200
Just forget the old pair
and buy yourself a new one.

63
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,240
You're looking for an old pair
with such seriousness?

64
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:24,279
Get lost, man.

65
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,480
Mother!

66
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,799
Medical miracle!

67
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:50,799
The fact that you're a doctor?

68
00:07:52,039 --> 00:07:53,520
Sometimes, I speak the truth.

69
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:57,159
A small fracture in the forearm.

70
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,159
Just a small fracture?

71
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,159
You were hoping
for something bigger?

72
00:08:01,239 --> 00:08:05,079
The way he screamed,
I thought his whole arm got chopped off.

73
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,480
He's building too much drama
for an opening scene.

74
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,799
Now that I'm here,
I'll control it.

75
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:11,599
You don't worry.

76
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:14,199
I'll put a cast.
You'll be fine in thirty days.

77
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,039
You'll have to change it once in ten days!

78
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:17,639
Watch it, sir.

79
00:08:17,679 --> 00:08:20,640
When I remove the third cast,
you'll be fully healed.

80
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,480
- Shanthi!
- Yes, doctor.

81
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,360
- Shanthi?
- Tell me, doctor.

82
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:28,239
Such a pretty nurse in
this run-down hospital?

83
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:29,240
Thanks, doctor.

84
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:31,439
I fixed the fracture,
please bandage his arm

85
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,600
Okay, doctor.
I will.

86
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,799
- Son?
- What?

87
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,080
- Tell me, doctor.
- How are you related to him?

88
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,919
He and I...
are not very close friends.

89
00:08:39,959 --> 00:08:40,959
But he's my junior.

90
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,840
What do you want now?
What's your fee?

91
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:43,839
Fees?

92
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:46,120
The reason I'm so
well known today...

93
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:47,959
...is his mother,
the Holy Betel-Leaf Seer.

94
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,440
Everyone comes seeking
Dr. Sathyamangalam Mahendran...

95
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,159
only because of this
Holy Betel-Leaf Seer.

96
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:54,239
- Show me?
- I'm an ardent devotee.

97
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:55,400
That's my junior's mother!

98
00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:35,359
Tell me your sorrows, child.

99
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,120
Tell me all the details, child.

100
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:40,640
I will tell you the holy words
to end your misery, child.

101
00:09:41,199 --> 00:09:42,159
Hello

102
00:09:42,199 --> 00:09:44,640
Greetings. You've called
the Holy Betel-Leaf Seer's Abode.

103
00:09:45,319 --> 00:09:47,999
Even Obama must get an appointment
before coming here, sir.

104
00:09:48,039 --> 00:09:49,760
No VIP or VVIP privilege.

105
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,080
Everyone is equal in
the eyes of our God.

106
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,560
- Anjali!
- Holy Seer!

107
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,279
- We take leave
- Okay

108
00:09:56,319 --> 00:09:59,359
There's a lady waiting outside
to know if her husband will get bail.

109
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,159
Token number 30.
Ask her to come.

110
00:10:01,199 --> 00:10:04,039
How did she come to be known
as the Holy Betel-Leaf Seer?

111
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:08,520
Just like a computer uses a monitor,
she uses betel-leaves as her monitor.

112
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:11,880
She sees the whole world
in the betel-leaf.

113
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:26,919
A Cuddalore based engineer, Mohanraj,
has been kidnapped by terrorists in Syria.

114
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:30,519
He had been serving as an engineer
in Syria for the past nine years.

115
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:34,520
Sandhya, look what's happened
to your father.

116
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:36,959
So far, more than 60
people of various...

117
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,520
...nationalities have
been kidnapped...

118
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:44,679
What will we do now?
We've been orphaned, we've got nobody.

119
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:48,960
The question remains
whether these victims,

120
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,320
including Mohanraj,
are alive or dead.

121
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,320
Oh, my hands are shivering.

122
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,880
Father!

123
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,679
Oh, god.

124
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,159
Mother, it says father's phone
is not reachable.

125
00:11:13,199 --> 00:11:15,439
Sandhya, don't do that.

126
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:19,919
Don't cry, child.
Your mother is here for you.

127
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,959
- Greetings, sir
- Sir, please wait!

128
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,080
We have just one question.

129
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,760
Greetings, madam.

130
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,279
Hello, sir.

131
00:11:40,319 --> 00:11:43,799
The ministry of external affairs
is talking to the embassy in Syria.

132
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:46,040
And our government is taking
all the necessary actions.

133
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,039
We'll take care of you.

134
00:11:47,079 --> 00:11:48,559
Sandhya is Mohanraj's daughter.

135
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,920
You don't worry.
Your dad will be back soon.

136
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:52,679
- Please help us out, sir.
- For sure.

137
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,720
Make sure the family is taken care of.

138
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:57,240
Till her father returns,
they must not face any problem.

139
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:58,640
- Goodbye, madam.
- Thank you, sir.

140
00:11:58,679 --> 00:12:00,640
- Sir, I have a question!
- Wait.

141
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:02,319
Is engineer Mohanraj alive or dead?

142
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,840
What action has been
taken by our government?

143
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,039
And the Syrian government?

144
00:12:05,079 --> 00:12:07,439
Which terrorist organization
has been involved in the kidnapping?

145
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,840
So far the terrorists have killed
the people they kidnapped.

146
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:10,880
Will Mohanraj survive?

147
00:12:10,919 --> 00:12:12,400
What about his family's security?

148
00:12:12,439 --> 00:12:17,520
The government is taking steps
to bring back engineer Mohanraj safely.

149
00:12:17,559 --> 00:12:19,119
Please be patient until then.

150
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,679
I'm home. We can give it for service.
I'll get money from my mother.

151
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,200
What a pain!

152
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,080
I'll call you back.

153
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:32,360
My husband has been working in Syria
for nine years now.

154
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,480
He's a good man.

155
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:36,480
He loved me and my daughter
a great deal.

156
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,360
He even visited us
six months ago.

157
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,840
- Anjali!
- Son...

158
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:45,039
Your mother is busy with her devotees.
Could you turn down the volume?

159
00:12:45,079 --> 00:12:47,959
- I'm listening to important news, too.
- It's a disturbance to her.

160
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,440
Even your constant drumming
is a disturbance to me.

161
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,240
You won't even let me
watch the news?

162
00:12:53,959 --> 00:12:58,239
Even the morning of the kidnapping,
he spoke to me and my daughter.

163
00:12:58,279 --> 00:13:01,360
This is so unexpected.

164
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,799
You're watching it live?

165
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,840
Mohanraj used to live in my colony.

166
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,640
I need my husband back.
My daughter needs her father.

167
00:13:08,679 --> 00:13:11,559
The Central and State governments
should somehow help my husband.

168
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,640
Please cut that call.

169
00:13:12,679 --> 00:13:14,919
They're seeing me live
on TV.

170
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:18,439
The media and the people
should support us.

171
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,480
Ask your daughter
to say a few words?

172
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:23,039
Please don't ask her anything.

173
00:13:23,079 --> 00:13:24,279
Let's go.

174
00:13:26,199 --> 00:13:27,279
Madam, wait!

175
00:13:27,319 --> 00:13:29,760
Sorry, I got delayed.
Please give me an interview?

176
00:13:30,039 --> 00:13:31,199
Hello.

177
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,480
We can't cry separately for each channel.

178
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,319
Is it her fault
that you came late?

179
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,120
Bharathi, take your daughter home.

180
00:13:37,159 --> 00:13:38,319
You, come here.

181
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,360
- You carry on.
- Tell me, madam.

182
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,120
I'm their neighbour.

183
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:44,400
I know Mohanraj very well.

184
00:13:44,439 --> 00:13:46,479
He and I were very close.

185
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,439
Shall I give you an interview
about him?

186
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,800
Should I interview you
just because you put on makeup?

187
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,320
Let me know if your
husband goes missing.

188
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,320
I'll interview you then.

189
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,480
Look at that face!
And she's put on perfume, too.

190
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,480
Hello, sir?

191
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,440
I've come to Mohanraj's house.

192
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,840
Their house is locked.

193
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,120
Yes, sir.

194
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:07,760
They've gone to
the Holy Betel-Leaf Seer's house.

195
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:43,919
The same day that your father was kidnapped
you must have noticed a symptom?

196
00:14:45,079 --> 00:14:47,159
- No such thing.
- Think hard.

197
00:14:54,319 --> 00:14:56,439
I missed my slipper that day.

198
00:14:56,799 --> 00:14:59,039
- What time?
- Around 8:50...

199
00:14:59,079 --> 00:15:02,119
- When was your father kidnapped?
- About the same time.

200
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:03,640
You said there was no such thing?

201
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:05,919
What's the connection
between my missing...

202
00:15:05,959 --> 00:15:08,519
...slipper and my
father's kidnapping?

203
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:09,880
There is a connection.

204
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:13,240
There is a connection between a big event
that happens somewhere in this world,

205
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,439
and a small unrelated event
that happens elsewhere.

206
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,000
Not everyone can
understand that.

207
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:17,839
Yes, Holy One.

208
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,760
Everyone is saying something
or the other.

209
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:22,640
- We're scared.
- My father is alive, right?

210
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:35,679
Your father is alive.

211
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,640
They've locked him up somewhere.

212
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,720
I can travel the whole world
in the palm of my hands.

213
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:46,240
But you need passport
and visa to go there.

214
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:50,199
Holy One...

215
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,679
Did you really see my father?

216
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,640
Come here.

217
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:55,799
Sit.

218
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,480
- What is your name, dear?
- Sandhya.

219
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,400
- What are you studying?
- BBA Final Year.

220
00:16:00,439 --> 00:16:02,520
You're very fond of your father?

221
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:04,439
Her father means the world to her.

222
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,800
And he too.

223
00:16:06,919 --> 00:16:09,039
One slipper went missing.
The other one?

224
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,000
I left it behind in the bus.

225
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:12,439
That was your mistake.

226
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,640
- Who bought you those slippers?
- My father.

227
00:16:14,679 --> 00:16:17,120
Those slippers saved your father
from his ill-fortune.

228
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:18,520
I don't understand.

229
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:20,119
You must see those slippers again.

230
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:22,279
How?
I missed it four days ago.

231
00:16:22,319 --> 00:16:24,479
You don't worry about that.
I'll handle it.

232
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:27,039
It's my job to make you
see those slippers again.

233
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,560
Okay?

234
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,600
But you must do
something before that.

235
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,439
Tell me, Holy One.

236
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,920
You must give curd rice to
seven people for seven days.

237
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,120
Those seven should be
handicapped.

238
00:16:37,159 --> 00:16:37,959
Okay.

239
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,840
- Can you cook?
- I can.

240
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,439
It should be prepared by you.

241
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:45,240
Come and meet me after
completing this holy task.

242
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:47,800
You will hear positive news
about your father by then.

243
00:16:48,239 --> 00:16:49,799
Okay, madam.
Thanks.

244
00:17:05,479 --> 00:17:07,360
Anjali, what happened there?

245
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:09,640
Your mother asked me to check
on that noise.

246
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:12,439
She can see what's happening in Syria,
but not in her house?

247
00:17:12,479 --> 00:17:13,880
Put that away.

248
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:30,840
'Directly or in some other form...'

249
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,760
'...when you see that slipper,
it means you shall see your father'

250
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:39,759
'If you find that slipper again
you will get your father back'

251
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:57,039
Oh, no!

252
00:17:57,959 --> 00:18:01,319
Sandhya believed my mother
and now she's looking for her slipper!

253
00:18:16,239 --> 00:18:20,640
"Slippers"

254
00:18:20,679 --> 00:18:25,320
"My girl's slippers
went missing"

255
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,919
"And I'm going around
searching, searching"

256
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:34,520
"My girl's slippers
went missing"

257
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:38,200
"And I'm going around
searching, searching."

258
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:46,280
"Slippers...slippers
Those slippers."

259
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,600
"Her slippers
They went missing."

260
00:18:48,679 --> 00:18:53,279
"My girl's slippers
went missing"

261
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:57,840
"And I'm going around
searching, searching"

262
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:02,560
"My girl.. my girl...
My girl's slippers went missing."

263
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:07,919
"My girl's slippers went missing.
They went missing."

264
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:16,520
"Slippers...those slippers
They went missing."

265
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:19,280
"My girl's slippers went missing."

266
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:22,000
"Slippers"

267
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:27,080
"Slippers"

268
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:32,840
"Round and round, I
go looking for it;

269
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:37,560
"Day and night I pursue,
I'll find it"

270
00:19:38,159 --> 00:19:42,560
"My girl is twenty,
Her shoe size is six."

271
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:47,199
"Her heart grieves this loss,
Finder will be rewarded"

272
00:19:47,239 --> 00:19:52,120
"It's a red slipper with a bow
And black base;

273
00:19:52,159 --> 00:19:56,560
"Such a pretty slipper,
It will tempt you to steal."

274
00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:01,120
"I search for it even in my dreams;
I pray to God for guidance."

275
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:06,120
"If you have seen it,
You must call me."

276
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:09,479
"I will fall at your feet
To thank you."

277
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,199
"My FB ID is krishnankitnan"

278
00:20:15,239 --> 00:20:18,439
"And what I search
for is her slippers."

279
00:20:19,479 --> 00:20:23,999
"My girl's slippers
went missing"

280
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:28,720
"And I'm going around
searching, searching."

281
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:33,400
"My girl...my girl...
My girl's slippers went missing."

282
00:20:33,439 --> 00:20:38,600
"My girl's slippers went missing.
They went missing."

283
00:20:41,159 --> 00:20:44,279
Why does everyone come here
asking about the slipper?

284
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,800
What's so special about it?

285
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,080
Wait a minute.

286
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,640
Someone just asked me about
the slipper.

287
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:51,679
- I don't understand.
- Where did he go?

288
00:20:51,719 --> 00:20:53,519
I don't understand, either.

289
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,679
I left it right here.
Please help me.

290
00:20:56,719 --> 00:21:01,079
After completing the schedule,
this bus is taken to a bunk...

291
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,159
where an old man cleans it up.

292
00:21:02,199 --> 00:21:03,439
Ask him if you want.

293
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,040
When you were cleaning this bus
four days ago...

294
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:22,560
there must have been a ladies'
footwear, pink coloured.

295
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,800
Did you happen to see it?

296
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:28,600
Sometime, while cleaning the bus
I may find a purse.

297
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,280
If it's an empty purse,
I'll give it to the manager.

298
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,439
If there's money,
I'll give it to my wife.

299
00:21:32,479 --> 00:21:35,039
This was a single slipper.
I threw it in the trash.

300
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,400
Where is that trashcan?

301
00:21:36,439 --> 00:21:39,719
The trashcan is right there.
But they collect the trash everyday.

302
00:21:39,759 --> 00:21:41,359
- Son...
- Yes, sir?

303
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,800
When you're going to the trashcan
throw this away, too?

304
00:21:53,959 --> 00:21:54,759
Hello?

305
00:21:55,999 --> 00:21:57,880
- Hello?
- Hello, is this Sandhya?

306
00:21:57,919 --> 00:21:59,080
Yes, tell me.

307
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,840
I'm calling from the Holy
Betel-Leaf Seer's house.

308
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,919
Yes, tell me.

309
00:22:01,959 --> 00:22:04,360
She asked me to call you.

310
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:08,519
You're going in search
of the slipper?

311
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,720
Yes, because the Holy
One told me to.

312
00:22:10,759 --> 00:22:13,439
No, you needn't
go looking for it.

313
00:22:13,479 --> 00:22:16,599
- She said it will come to you.
- Oh, is it?

314
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,439
Did she say anything
about my father?

315
00:22:18,479 --> 00:22:20,079
- She did.
- What?

316
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,439
She asked you not to worry.

317
00:22:21,479 --> 00:22:24,279
- Who are you?
- I'm a devotee of the Holy One.

318
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,440
What else did she say?

319
00:22:26,479 --> 00:22:29,239
She asked you not to
go looking for the slipper.

320
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,280
Okay, I won't.

321
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:34,000
But tell the Holy One that I am
placing my trust in her.

322
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,159
Please.

323
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:36,999
- Okay.
- Bye.

324
00:22:59,199 --> 00:23:04,479
"Slippers...those slippers
They went missing."

325
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:10,280
"If one slipper is lost,
the pair goes waste."

326
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:15,480
"I'm roaming as a bearded man;
Need to find and return it to her."

327
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:20,159
"On stones, thorns and puddles,
the slipper wears out and carries us."

328
00:23:20,199 --> 00:23:24,799
"A friend when we step out,
Sun or rain, it's at our doorstep."

329
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:29,439
"When he hit someone in anger,
the weapon of choice is slipper."

330
00:23:29,479 --> 00:23:33,839
"When we are frustrated,
it becomes a cuss word."

331
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:38,719
"The crown on the head is cherished;
The slipper that serves us is trampled."

332
00:23:38,759 --> 00:23:42,839
"Need to sacrifice
like the slipper."

333
00:23:43,479 --> 00:23:47,360
"I have to live for my lover."

334
00:23:48,199 --> 00:23:52,759
"I yearn to see her
smile and laughter"

335
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:57,159
"I'm going searching
for her slipper"

336
00:23:57,199 --> 00:24:01,360
"My girl's slippers
went missing"

337
00:24:01,439 --> 00:24:06,400
"And I'm going around
searching, searching."

338
00:24:06,439 --> 00:24:11,039
"My girl... my girl...
My girl's slippers went missing."

339
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:16,040
"My girl's slippers went missing.
They went missing."

340
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:36,280
Greetings to the noble
people, the voters.

341
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,400
The elections come
only once in every five years.

342
00:24:38,439 --> 00:24:41,519
Your candidate will come to his legislature
only before the elections.

343
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,200
But this 'Honest Word' Sekar...

344
00:24:43,239 --> 00:24:44,959
Hello, Kings of Media!

345
00:24:44,999 --> 00:24:47,079
Normally, you don't come
even when I beg you.

346
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,320
What brings you here?

347
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,919
Couldn't find any other news?

348
00:24:51,959 --> 00:24:55,159
There are many political
diseases in town.

349
00:24:55,199 --> 00:24:58,039
But I am an honest politician.

350
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,360
A clean politician.

351
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,120
I have no family.
But I have a ration card.

352
00:25:03,199 --> 00:25:05,919
I have a gas connection.
But I don't avail subsidy.

353
00:25:05,959 --> 00:25:09,199
I have no black money.
But I have money in my bank account.

354
00:25:09,239 --> 00:25:11,199
I won't pay for fake votes.

355
00:25:11,239 --> 00:25:14,239
Yellow shirt, my words sound
foolish to you?

356
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:17,640
Only a stupid man pays for votes.
I'm a smart man.

357
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:19,360
Shankar has directed
a movie in my name.

358
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,679
I'm a 'Gentleman'.

359
00:25:20,719 --> 00:25:23,999
I won't let you go
until you choose me as your MLA.

360
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:26,840
I will go from street to street
and spit on the faces of wrong-doers.

361
00:25:26,919 --> 00:25:29,159
Till you trust me,
I will ask for votes...

362
00:25:31,159 --> 00:25:34,320
Who flung this slipper
at me, man?

363
00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:37,679
It's a lady's slipper.
Woman, who flung this at me?

364
00:25:37,719 --> 00:25:39,880
You flung a pink slipper
to go with my shirt?

365
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:42,080
What will I do with this single slipper?

366
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:45,360
I wear these sunglasses
to observe who is watching me...

367
00:25:45,439 --> 00:25:46,519
...attacking me.
<b><font color="#ff0000"><i>MAZE HDRelease</i></font></b>

368
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,280
Whether you are a brave man...

369
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,200
Or a brave woman.

370
00:25:50,239 --> 00:25:52,519
Stand before me
with the pair to this slipper.

371
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,240
Leader, show us the slipper.

372
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,320
Look, this is the slipper that was
hurled at me.

373
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,240
Next time, I should fling
a cracker at him.

374
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:01,240
Through this TV channel,
I challenge my opposition.

375
00:26:01,759 --> 00:26:03,159
Not just this slipper...

376
00:26:03,199 --> 00:26:07,159
even if you hurl a bomb at me,
I won't quit politics.

377
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,439
Good evening.
Special bulletin.

378
00:26:13,479 --> 00:26:17,319
'Honest Word' Sekar was attacked
by an unknown person.

379
00:26:18,199 --> 00:26:19,039
Tell me, mom.

380
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:19,880
It's the Harvest Festival.

381
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:21,919
You haven't worn new
clothes or prayed.

382
00:26:21,959 --> 00:26:23,079
Where are you?

383
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,400
I'm coming, mom.

384
00:26:24,439 --> 00:26:26,279
Your hand is broken.
Won't you stay at home?

385
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,120
Come fast

386
00:26:27,159 --> 00:26:28,400
I came to meet a friend.

387
00:26:28,439 --> 00:26:33,080
'Honest Word' Sekar
known as 'Political Clown'

388
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,120
has never recovered his deposit...

389
00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:38,479
...was attacked by a stranger
with a slipper.

390
00:26:38,519 --> 00:26:41,919
Watch the exclusive footage
of this attack.

391
00:26:41,959 --> 00:26:43,400
Hang up now.

392
00:26:43,479 --> 00:26:46,199
I knew he'd get slippered someday!

393
00:26:46,239 --> 00:26:47,759
He got hit with a
lady's slipper, but...

394
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,200
...still gives interviews
without any shame!

395
00:26:49,239 --> 00:26:50,640
Calls himself a politician.

396
00:26:50,679 --> 00:26:52,439
Take a good look.

397
00:26:52,479 --> 00:26:55,159
Who hit me with this pink slipper?
I speak to you.

398
00:26:55,239 --> 00:26:57,400
I will even forgive
someone stands in...

399
00:26:57,439 --> 00:26:59,120
...front of me and stabs
me with a knife.

400
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:03,640
But someone who attacked me
from the back, with a lady's slipper...

401
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:06,959
I will find that guy
and chop his hands off.

402
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:09,880
This is the promise of 'Honest Word' Sekar.

403
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:12,999
That guy who got slippered?
Where is his house?

404
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,360
It's at Old Town.

405
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:18,479
- You haven't paid!
- Sorry, I forgot.

406
00:27:18,519 --> 00:27:19,799
He'll end your life.

407
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:23,240
- Don't go to join his party!
- Shut up, man.

408
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:25,080
Why won't that guy listen to me?

409
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,919
What will happen to his life now?

410
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,199
Mr. Security!

411
00:27:29,759 --> 00:27:31,039
Mr. Security!

412
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,640
What do you want?

413
00:27:32,679 --> 00:27:34,159
It's urgent.
I need to meet the leader.

414
00:27:34,199 --> 00:27:36,719
You can't meet him today.
Come back tomorrow.

415
00:27:36,759 --> 00:27:37,279
Why?

416
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:40,040
- He's gone to the Jallikattu protest.
- So, tomorrow?

417
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,640
Who are you?
What do you want anyway?

418
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:43,759
I need to meet the leader
about the slipper.

419
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,200
Slipper?

420
00:27:45,239 --> 00:27:47,999
- He's come to confess?
- What are you mumbling?

421
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:50,400
Come in the morning.
I'll inform the leader.

422
00:27:50,439 --> 00:27:51,840
Okay, I'll be here in the morning.

423
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,159
Do come.

424
00:27:53,199 --> 00:27:55,080
- Don't forget to inform him.
- Okay.

425
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:59,159
Come tomorrow.
But you will never return home.

426
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:03,120
We've fed six people.
I can't find the seventh person!

427
00:28:03,159 --> 00:28:05,400
The seventh person is
always the trouble.

428
00:28:05,439 --> 00:28:07,159
- Yuck!
- Why?

429
00:28:07,199 --> 00:28:10,719
It's festival day.
You are giving me bland curd rice?

430
00:28:10,759 --> 00:28:12,079
I eat it through the year.

431
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,199
She is doing it as a penance.

432
00:28:13,239 --> 00:28:15,759
She will eat her meal
only after feeding you.

433
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,120
Please take it?

434
00:28:17,159 --> 00:28:19,199
- Did you eat?
- I had sweet rice in the morning!

435
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,760
You eat sweet rice
but give me curd rice?

436
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:24,320
- Please take it, brother.
- Oh, no way.

437
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,679
Give me 100 bucks.

438
00:28:25,719 --> 00:28:27,079
- For what?
- Give me.

439
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,040
Okay. Here.

440
00:28:31,479 --> 00:28:33,079
Please do eat it.

441
00:28:33,159 --> 00:28:35,400
Once I commit, I won't omit.

442
00:28:35,439 --> 00:28:37,840
- Eat it soon, brother.
- Okay, baby.

443
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,280
Yay!
Let's go!

444
00:28:40,759 --> 00:28:41,719
Why are you late?

445
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,360
It's just 8.
Has the leader woken up?

446
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:46,080
He never went to sleep.
He kept pestering me about you all night.

447
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,880
Go, quick.
The supporters are all waiting.

448
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:48,600
Okay!

449
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,919
Run!

450
00:28:51,519 --> 00:28:52,559
Hello!

451
00:28:52,999 --> 00:28:54,079
Hi, there.

452
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,679
The leader is waiting for me.

453
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,479
Hi!

454
00:28:58,999 --> 00:29:01,359
We caught the guy
who slippered you, leader!

455
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,560
It wasn't me!

456
00:29:12,719 --> 00:29:13,959
Greetings, sir.

457
00:29:13,999 --> 00:29:15,079
This guy?

458
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,520
- Hey!
- Leader?

459
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,480
- Bring me the stuff.
- The stuff?

460
00:29:18,519 --> 00:29:19,959
You've done a big job!

461
00:29:19,999 --> 00:29:22,439
Leader, you have mistaken me.

462
00:29:22,479 --> 00:29:24,199
Please listen to
what I have to say.

463
00:29:26,199 --> 00:29:28,880
- Where is the stuff?
- Bringing it.

464
00:29:28,919 --> 00:29:30,080
A garland?

465
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,520
- The man who Slippered!
- Hail Him!

466
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,840
- The man who Slippered!
- Hail Him!

467
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:38,199
- Stop
- Why are you hailing me?

468
00:29:38,239 --> 00:29:41,279
If you had hit me with
a slipper five years ago,

469
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:43,120
I'd have become an MLA then.

470
00:29:43,159 --> 00:29:44,040
But I didn't--

471
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,800
Even when I pay to
advertise for publicity...

472
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:49,679
...they put me in a small box
on the last page.

473
00:29:49,719 --> 00:29:53,839
But today, I've got publicity
all over the state.

474
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,320
- But I saw the TV-
- Yes!

475
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,679
Every TV channel is playing
your slipper and my face.

476
00:29:58,719 --> 00:30:00,880
Sekar and the slipper.
Slipper and the Sekar.

477
00:30:00,919 --> 00:30:03,199
I don't know how to
thank you for this.

478
00:30:03,239 --> 00:30:05,079
Shall I fall at your feet?

479
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,439
- Say that I don't have to!
- You don't have to.

480
00:30:07,479 --> 00:30:10,159
You don't have to thank me.
Please listen to me?

481
00:30:10,199 --> 00:30:11,360
What do you have to say?

482
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:14,280
You'll hit me with the other slipper
in the next gathering?

483
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,080
You've misunderstood me.

484
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:18,239
I have nothing to do
with the man who slippered you.

485
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,000
What?

486
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,600
Nothing to do with him?

487
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,560
I didn't slipper you.

488
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,719
Take this garland...

489
00:30:24,759 --> 00:30:26,519
And put this on my cut-out
at the entrance.

490
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,520
But I have something to do
with the slipper.

491
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,880
You and the slipper?

492
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:33,640
Or you and the owner of the slipper?

493
00:30:33,999 --> 00:30:36,079
I like that girl a lot.

494
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,679
- Love?
- Yes!

495
00:30:37,719 --> 00:30:39,559
- There has to be a flashback?
- Definitely.

496
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:41,880
Until six months ago...

497
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:45,759
I was like every other boy,
checking out every girl...

498
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,080
...and just chilling in life.

499
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:50,120
I became somebody's apprentice.
It all started that day.

500
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:52,120
- Morning, leader!
- Sit, there's no time.

501
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:54,800
- Newbies are never on time.
- Let's go?

502
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,520
He put his arms around me?

503
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:59,159
You're my apprentice,
not my straitjacket.

504
00:30:59,199 --> 00:31:00,519
Take your hands off.
Hands up!

505
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,760
- Don't put them down.
- How possible?

506
00:31:03,239 --> 00:31:05,919
Junior, these girls have hit me
four times already.

507
00:31:05,959 --> 00:31:06,999
Be quiet.

508
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:10,400
Okay, girls. The next pose we
shall do is called Vajrasana.

509
00:31:10,439 --> 00:31:11,919
What did she say?

510
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,159
They're ploughing the earth?

511
00:31:14,199 --> 00:31:15,199
How great they look!

512
00:31:15,239 --> 00:31:17,479
Leader, what are you doing?

513
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:18,999
Can't you see?
I'm checking them out.

514
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,440
- Whom?
- All of them.

515
00:31:20,519 --> 00:31:23,079
- All of them?
- Yes, but I only love one of them.

516
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:26,360
- Who is that girl?
- That girl wearing green t-shirt.

517
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,320
She's my girl.

518
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:30,320
Look how bright she is,
like a brand new tube light.

519
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:40,959
Okay, girls.
See you tomorrow.

520
00:31:40,999 --> 00:31:41,640
Shall we go?

521
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:44,799
That's all then?
It's already over?

522
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:47,640
They know only so much.
They do this same thing every day.

523
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:49,759
Why do you come here every day
and trouble us?

524
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,919
If I see you here tomorrow,
that'll be the end of you.

525
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,640
I don't understand her language.

526
00:31:54,679 --> 00:31:56,999
But her body language
looked aggressive?

527
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,159
Shut up.

528
00:31:58,199 --> 00:32:00,640
- I'll drop you home.
- Excuse me, Sandhya.

529
00:32:00,679 --> 00:32:04,239
Why do you walk around with that mat?
Come, let's go around in my bike?

530
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:06,080
- Stupid, you have no sense?
- Nope!

531
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:08,400
- I've told you so many times.
- He doesn't even have a face.

532
00:32:08,439 --> 00:32:09,999
- Don't talk to him. Let's go.
- Shut up, Trisha.

533
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,480
Your face irritates me.
Get lost.

534
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:12,479
Look, Sandhya...

535
00:32:12,519 --> 00:32:15,879
You can spit on my face
or hire men to beat me up.

536
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:18,600
But we shall fall in love
and get married.

537
00:32:18,919 --> 00:32:21,080
I swear this upon my junior.
Yeah?

538
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:22,480
Take it, Junior.

539
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,240
Sorry, Junior.

540
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:27,560
It's not about checking her out.
You must be alert.

541
00:32:27,959 --> 00:32:29,919
- What a shot!
- Stupid.

542
00:32:29,959 --> 00:32:32,360
It was aimed at him,
but fell on me.

543
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:35,719
I got hit by the same slipper
that you did, on my chest!

544
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,560
Give it to me.

545
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,679
Do you know who my sister is?
I'll sort you out.

546
00:32:40,719 --> 00:32:42,799
You have a sister too?
I didn't know.

547
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,840
Ask her to bring a mat
same time, same place tomorrow!

548
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,560
If I can't pick you up,
I'll pick up your sister. What say?

549
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:51,360
I met a beautiful girl
at a bad situation.

550
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:55,280
It's worse when you see a bad girl
at a beautiful situation.

551
00:32:55,759 --> 00:32:57,319
Very interesting.

552
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,959
Drink your coffee and continue.

553
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:01,200
- I don't need it now.
- That's love.

554
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:02,120
Next?

555
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:05,880
Then she had us beat up black and blue
with a police inspector she knew.

556
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:07,439
Right in front of Sandhya.

557
00:33:07,479 --> 00:33:09,799
- I'll end your life!
- You're only hitting me, not the leader!

558
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:12,199
You're the leader, huh?

559
00:33:12,239 --> 00:33:14,199
Hit them hard, sister.
Thick-skinned buffaloes!

560
00:33:14,239 --> 00:33:15,400
Don't hit me on my mouth!

561
00:33:15,439 --> 00:33:18,199
- What are you looking at?
- Why did you look?

562
00:33:18,239 --> 00:33:20,719
- Madam, it hurts!
- I never said it's fun.

563
00:33:20,759 --> 00:33:22,400
Abhi, get me water.

564
00:33:22,439 --> 00:33:23,600
- Okay, sister.
- Make it cold!

565
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:26,880
Even though she beat us,
out of pity, she's giving us water.

566
00:33:26,919 --> 00:33:28,479
She's a true Tamil Woman.

567
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:30,560
- What?
- Leader...

568
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,760
- The water is not for us.
- Who, then?

569
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,560
I misunderstood.
She is no Tamil woman.

570
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,560
What are you murmuring?

571
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,880
I said Tamilians never
get water, madam.

572
00:33:38,919 --> 00:33:41,919
Abhi, go get two sheets
of paper and pen.

573
00:33:41,959 --> 00:33:43,120
- Sandhya?
- Sister?

574
00:33:43,199 --> 00:33:44,559
What are your plans on Sundays?

575
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:47,080
I do yoga at 6 in the morning.

576
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,800
Leave one page blank.

577
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:51,120
Let's find out madam's program
and follow her, too.

578
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,320
Madam!

579
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:54,999
- Why do you disturb him?
- Just making sure he's writing it.

580
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:57,039
That's my problem.
Then Monday to Friday?

581
00:33:57,559 --> 00:33:58,679
I go to college.

582
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,880
You walk from our colony
and then take the bus?

583
00:34:00,919 --> 00:34:03,880
I offered to take you
in my bike, but you refused.

584
00:34:03,959 --> 00:34:05,519
- Saturday?
- I stay home.

585
00:34:05,599 --> 00:34:07,559
But I go swimming
from 11 to 12.

586
00:34:07,599 --> 00:34:08,880
Swimming!

587
00:34:08,919 --> 00:34:10,320
That's a great attire.

588
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:12,760
Madam, find out that
location for us?

589
00:34:13,079 --> 00:34:15,119
The doctor asked me to start
swimming to lose weight.

590
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:15,760
Go inside, girls.

591
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,600
She went inside without even
looking at me.

592
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,960
I didn't feel the pain of those blows.
She was THAT beautiful.

593
00:34:19,999 --> 00:34:22,119
She gave us the
timetable and left?

594
00:34:24,519 --> 00:34:27,400
Madam might look great
in swimwear, too.

595
00:34:27,439 --> 00:34:29,519
What are you looking at?

596
00:34:29,559 --> 00:34:31,999
Malavika madam, are you
single or married?

597
00:34:32,039 --> 00:34:34,320
You're trying to hit on ME now?

598
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:36,240
You can support a man
who is going to fight.

599
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:38,680
But not someone
who is going to stalk.

600
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:39,760
What was the result?

601
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,640
She's made us stand
like garden statues!

602
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:43,520
Why can't you keep
your mouth shut?

603
00:34:43,559 --> 00:34:46,119
A mouth is not meant to be shut.
Here comes the rowdy lady.

604
00:34:46,599 --> 00:34:48,880
You want me to give her
the love letter?

605
00:34:48,919 --> 00:34:50,880
No, sir.
This is Sandhya's schedule.

606
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:53,240
It has the details of where
she goes and when.

607
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,840
The places Sandhya goes
to are 144 to you.

608
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,320
You must never go near her.

609
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:01,640
- What if she comes where we are?
- I'll shoot you on the spot.

610
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:02,919
Let's stay home.

611
00:35:02,959 --> 00:35:06,199
Even an evil spirit may
cross her but not us!

612
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,760
I need to hold this safe, sir.

613
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:10,800
Or that inspector will slap us
whenever she sees us.

614
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:16,799
What are you doing here?

615
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,519
- I'm drinking milk.
- Where is that paper?

616
00:35:18,559 --> 00:35:20,519
- Here.
- Okay, go.

617
00:35:20,559 --> 00:35:22,679
In spite of being alert,
I got caught one day.

618
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,800
Go meet Madam.

619
00:35:25,959 --> 00:35:29,519
Leader, we're caught.
Do you have Sandhya's schedule?

620
00:35:29,559 --> 00:35:31,519
I washed it away along with
my laundry.

621
00:35:31,559 --> 00:35:33,159
It's gone?
But I have mine.

622
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,880
You do?
Show me yours?

623
00:35:34,919 --> 00:35:35,880
Here.

624
00:35:35,919 --> 00:35:37,559
Now I have it, and you don't.

625
00:35:37,639 --> 00:35:39,679
- What about me?
- Jail time.

626
00:35:39,959 --> 00:35:41,599
Your bike's registration papers?

627
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:43,279
Bike's papers?

628
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,680
- Do you have it or not?
- I do, madam.

629
00:35:46,479 --> 00:35:48,559
- Why does it say 'Shakeela'?
- She got married.

630
00:35:48,639 --> 00:35:50,999
Who cares?
Who is Shakeela to you?

631
00:35:51,039 --> 00:35:53,959
- She is my ex girlfriend.
- But you have her vehicle?

632
00:35:53,999 --> 00:35:57,239
Shakeela's husband drove her away.
I drove the bike away.

633
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,280
- Just two differences!
- You!

634
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,360
- Where are the papers?
- That's the one, madam.

635
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,479
Good one, madam!

636
00:36:02,559 --> 00:36:05,279
What man?
That's an old joke.

637
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:07,039
But my jokes were fresh, right?

638
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:10,240
If I ever see you again
without the paper, I'll kill you.

639
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,919
What's that inspector's name?

640
00:36:12,039 --> 00:36:14,840
- Malavika.
- Oh, a lady cop?

641
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:17,519
- I'll handle her.
- Sir!

642
00:36:17,559 --> 00:36:20,759
I meant, I'll transfer her
when I become an MLA.

643
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,080
Since then, she thinks
I don't see her.

644
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:25,359
But I see her every single day.

645
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:32,559
You've put on many disguises
like Kamal Hassan.

646
00:36:32,599 --> 00:36:36,159
Why have you come to me?
I can't arrange your marriage.

647
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,680
I want that slipper, sir.

648
00:36:39,079 --> 00:36:39,719
Here.

649
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,880
Not this one.
That slipper.

650
00:36:41,919 --> 00:36:43,680
I can't give you that slipper.

651
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:45,760
Please, sir.
I need it!

652
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:50,200
That slipper has been a turning point
in my political life.

653
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,800
I will need that slipper
when I write my biography.

654
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:55,200
Sir, please. I need that slipper!

655
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,439
Why do you need it?

656
00:36:56,479 --> 00:36:58,760
My mother lied claiming
to tell a prophecy.

657
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:02,320
That girl believes that she will see
her father only when she finds the slipper.

658
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:04,360
And goes roaming
from street to street.

659
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,079
This is 2017.

660
00:37:06,119 --> 00:37:08,119
The whole world operates online.

661
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,480
You're going after a slipper
to find true love?

662
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:13,759
Sir, I used to think like you
until I met that girl.

663
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:16,200
But I fell at your feet for her.

664
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,360
That is love.
<b><font color="#ff0000"><i>MAZE HDRelease</i></font></b>

665
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,720
How many voters in your house?

666
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:20,439
Three!

667
00:37:20,479 --> 00:37:22,039
I can't give it for three votes.

668
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:23,400
The whole street
will listen to me.

669
00:37:23,439 --> 00:37:24,999
And the whole town will
listen to my mother.

670
00:37:25,039 --> 00:37:26,759
I will get down and work for you
during elections.

671
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:27,999
I will make you win, sir.

672
00:37:28,039 --> 00:37:29,679
Please give me that slipper, sir.

673
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:31,000
How do I believe you?

674
00:37:31,519 --> 00:37:33,639
I swear on that slipper.
Please, sir.

675
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:36,840
Sir, the slipper?

676
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,240
Unfold it.

677
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,439
Slowly.

678
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:46,320
This is the slipper, sir.

679
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:48,120
You've washed it?

680
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:51,280
Take it and leave
before I change my mind.

681
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,640
Can I take a selfie?

682
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,360
With me or the slipper?

683
00:37:54,439 --> 00:37:55,519
Both, sir.

684
00:37:55,559 --> 00:37:57,639
- You're insulting me?
- No, sir.

685
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,400
- A couple picture?
- Yes, sir.

686
00:37:59,439 --> 00:38:00,439
Go on.

687
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,320
Thanks, sir.

688
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,200
You've helped my love
life in a big way.

689
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,640
I need to record it!

690
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:09,320
Please cast your vote
for 'Honest Word' Sekar.

691
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:13,959
I warn the terrorists who kidnapped
the son of our soil, Janakaraj...

692
00:38:13,999 --> 00:38:16,400
Leader, not Janakaraj.
Mohanraj.

693
00:38:16,439 --> 00:38:17,360
Yeah, Mohanraj!

694
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,999
I warn the terrorists
who kidnapped him...

695
00:38:20,039 --> 00:38:24,079
If I come to Syria,
I'll beat you to death.

696
00:38:24,119 --> 00:38:26,479
But there's a reason
why I can't come.

697
00:38:26,519 --> 00:38:28,639
- What's that reason?
- Shut up, don't interrupt me.

698
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:31,040
- Go to the back row!
- Fraud!

699
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:34,919
The reason is,
I don't have a passport.

700
00:38:34,959 --> 00:38:35,840
Super leader

701
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:38,640
Are they even paying attention?
They just clap for everything.

702
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:44,519
Coming back to my point...

703
00:38:44,559 --> 00:38:46,759
The son of our soil, Amulraj
has been kidnapped

704
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,760
What's his name?

705
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,240
- What?
- I have a request.

706
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:52,160
- What?
- I sponsored the mic.

707
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,880
Maybe I could speak a few words?

708
00:38:53,919 --> 00:38:55,519
- It's your money?
- Yes, leader.

709
00:38:55,559 --> 00:38:56,159
Speak

710
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,040
But there might be
a power cut halfway.

711
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:01,479
I have sponsored for the mic.
I shall talk first!

712
00:39:01,559 --> 00:39:03,639
Move away! I'm no dummy.
I will also speak.

713
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,919
I paid for all this.
What did you ever do?

714
00:39:05,959 --> 00:39:07,559
I have given my voice!

715
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:10,239
Sandhya!

716
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:11,719
Here we go.

717
00:39:12,519 --> 00:39:13,360
Sandhya!

718
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,160
Move away, guys

719
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:17,439
Sandhya, wait a minute.
Sandhya! Please, please.

720
00:39:17,519 --> 00:39:19,800
They're all fighting
for the mic.

721
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:22,360
But I'm fighting for my
father-in-law, you know?

722
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,840
Just say the word and I will become
a suicide bomber.

723
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:28,039
You already look
like an atom bomb.

724
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:28,679
Get lost!

725
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:32,360
I will go. If you say the word,
I'll go to 'Siri' and save your father.

726
00:39:32,959 --> 00:39:35,639
Forget saving my father.
First get the country's name right.

727
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:38,080
- What did I say?
- It's not 'Siri'. It's Syria.

728
00:39:38,119 --> 00:39:42,039
I totally misheard what the boys said
when I asked for the country's name.

729
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:44,680
Sandhya left half an hour back.

730
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:47,120
Bring the canvas and
chairs to my terrace.

731
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,640
Tomorrow is my granny's
death anniversary.

732
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:49,960
We'll continue this.

733
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:51,639
You can't hit me!

734
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,280
Oh, no. The umbrella!

735
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,120
Auto!

736
00:41:46,119 --> 00:41:49,719
You are truly great.
Everything is happening just as you said.

737
00:41:49,999 --> 00:41:52,280
Now I understand your powers.

738
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:54,840
- Thank you so much.
- I did nothing.

739
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,439
It was all Her doing.

740
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:59,599
I gave curd rice to seven people
for seven days like you said.

741
00:41:59,639 --> 00:42:03,799
The very next day, the terrorists
released a video of my father.

742
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:07,280
I saw that video.
My father is alive.

743
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:13,119
I'll smack you!
You're glaring at me?

744
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:17,200
This is a warning to
the Syrian government.

745
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:20,640
If these lives mean anything to you,
release our leader immediately.

746
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:23,640
Or we will chop all their heads
to little pieces.

747
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:25,440
We are innocent.
Why are you threatening us?

748
00:42:25,479 --> 00:42:27,479
You're talking back to me?

749
00:42:27,519 --> 00:42:28,639
You're talking back to me?

750
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:32,120
The next time you talk back to me
you will die.

751
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,440
Do you wish to live?

752
00:42:33,519 --> 00:42:35,800
Even the thought of escaping
from here means death.

753
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:50,279
The left slipper that
I missed in the bus?

754
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:52,240
Someone has uploaded
it on Face book.

755
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:55,120
The left slipper was the one
that you left behind?

756
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:57,200
Yes, that's the one.

757
00:42:57,240 --> 00:43:00,120
- I saw it. You want to see?
- No, that's okay.

758
00:43:00,439 --> 00:43:02,559
- Why?
- I'm the one who let you see it.

759
00:43:02,599 --> 00:43:05,079
And you're showing it to me?
Don't worry, dear.

760
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:09,719
You have only seen the picture.
Soon I will show you both the slippers.

761
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:12,280
Then your woes will be gone.
Okay?

762
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:13,240
Thank you!

763
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:15,840
- That's all I want.
- Good things shall happen.

764
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:31,720
Goodbye!

765
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:48,880
How did you break your arm?

766
00:43:48,919 --> 00:43:50,840
I saw a girl in the bus...

767
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:53,720
- What did you ask him?
- I asked how he broke his arm.

768
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:55,680
Good question.
Show me your arm.

769
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:01,479
Your leg is broken.
Did we ask you how?

770
00:44:01,519 --> 00:44:03,519
- I was just killing time.
- Kill-joy!

771
00:44:03,559 --> 00:44:06,880
In a temple, you ask a guy if he's praying.
In a restaurant, you ask if he's eating.

772
00:44:06,919 --> 00:44:10,360
In a funeral, you ask if he's mourning.
In a hospital, you ask if he's ill.

773
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:13,400
You'll ask such mundane questions?
Your mouth is not just to speak.

774
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:15,679
Keeping it shut is also an option.
Go to another hospital.

775
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:17,120
- Get lost.
- The doctor asked me to come.

776
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:18,640
Tell him I asked you to leave.

777
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:19,520
Leave!

778
00:44:20,599 --> 00:44:23,039
Look at his walk, like Janakaraj
from the movie 'Aanpaavam'.

779
00:44:23,079 --> 00:44:25,519
If someone asks such useless
questions, don't answer.

780
00:44:25,559 --> 00:44:27,599
- Come inside.
- I'll come alone?

781
00:44:27,639 --> 00:44:28,679
You wish.

782
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:32,360
Sorry, doctor. I was supposed to come
earlier to change the cast.

783
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:35,400
How many times will you all
apologise for the same thing?

784
00:44:35,439 --> 00:44:37,760
Your friend would
come here first thing...

785
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:40,280
...in the morning, get
the first token...

786
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:43,720
and say, "My junior is busy today.
Sorry he couldn't make it."

787
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:44,600
Really, leader?

788
00:44:44,639 --> 00:44:46,479
I didn't come to apologise
to the doctor.

789
00:44:46,519 --> 00:44:48,039
I came to check out Shanthi.

790
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:48,959
That's typical.

791
00:44:48,999 --> 00:44:51,439
- Shanthi, change the dressing.
- Right away, doctor.

792
00:44:51,479 --> 00:44:53,999
Doctor, the nurse's dress is fine.
Why are you asking her to change?

793
00:44:54,039 --> 00:44:56,079
I just said nice things about you.

794
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:59,160
Shanthi, I'm going on my rounds.
Be careful with this guy.

795
00:45:00,999 --> 00:45:03,559
Shanthi dear, get rid of him soon!

796
00:45:04,439 --> 00:45:06,639
This is the second cast.
After the third

797
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:08,720
cast, you'll forget
me completely?

798
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:11,160
How could we forget?
Only the right side has been set.

799
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:12,320
The left one still remains.

800
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:14,240
We'll break it and use
it for the next month.

801
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:15,760
- Like my idea?
- Leader!

802
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:17,919
Won't you do me
this small favour?

803
00:45:17,959 --> 00:45:20,280
Shanthi dear, till the day
you start detesting me...

804
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:22,559
I shall go on breaking
every bone in...

805
00:45:22,599 --> 00:45:24,679
...his body for you
to go on mending.

806
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,120
I swear upon him.

807
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:40,200
TN - 31.
It's a local cab.

808
00:45:41,519 --> 00:45:42,719
Location...

809
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:45,400
See if this is fine?

810
00:45:45,439 --> 00:45:46,720
Fine!

811
00:45:53,079 --> 00:45:55,119
- Hello, brother.
- Yes. You want a ride?

812
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:57,920
No. Please look at this picture.
Whose vehicle is this?

813
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:00,480
- Isn't this Susai's vehicle?
- Yes.

814
00:46:00,519 --> 00:46:02,759
- It's 'that' thing.
- Oh, right!

815
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:06,360
What you do is, go straight
and make a right turn at the round-a-bout.

816
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:09,400
Go to the sixth building on that road.
He'll be sitting on a chair outside.

817
00:46:09,439 --> 00:46:11,479
I already met with him yesterday.
You go now.

818
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:14,800
- Oh, it's gone!
- Don't cry, what's the point?

819
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:20,520
Now my son has become
all alone!

820
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:24,999
You're crying over here.
and your mother over there..

821
00:46:25,039 --> 00:46:26,880
And there, your dog is crying.

822
00:46:26,919 --> 00:46:29,439
Your house has
become so forlorn!

823
00:46:29,479 --> 00:46:35,240
I haven't even paid the electricity bill.
Please let me borrow hundred bucks?

824
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:41,840
Susai! Brother?

825
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:45,999
- Does the dog bite?
- Dog, that's our guest. Let him go.

826
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:48,439
Even handicapped people
have heard about my thing?

827
00:46:48,479 --> 00:46:50,639
What to do?
It was that dramatic.

828
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:53,560
A new boy has come.
I'll cry with him for a while.

829
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:54,880
Then I'll get going, Susai.

830
00:46:54,919 --> 00:46:57,479
One must not bid goodbye
at this situation. Off you go.

831
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:02,439
Susai, he's a young boy.
Be kind to him, he only has one arm.

832
00:47:02,479 --> 00:47:04,439
Oh, come on.
Can't he handle two hours?

833
00:47:04,479 --> 00:47:05,639
Don't scare him off.

834
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:07,240
Come on, son.

835
00:47:09,079 --> 00:47:10,519
Brother, that mini truck...

836
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:13,840
- My mini truck, oh no!
- Bless that boy.

837
00:47:14,119 --> 00:47:15,799
Brother, I should be
crying in this situation.

838
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:16,559
Why do you cry?

839
00:47:16,599 --> 00:47:17,880
How could I not cry?

840
00:47:17,919 --> 00:47:21,840
I held it so close, but
I've been cheated.

841
00:47:21,919 --> 00:47:25,599
- That driver has cheated me.
- Oh, no!

842
00:47:25,639 --> 00:47:27,719
He eloped with your wife?

843
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:30,840
You dare to speak ill of my wife?
I'll kill you!

844
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:33,439
Do you know what
a fine lady she is?

845
00:47:33,479 --> 00:47:36,880
Knowing that I'm incapable of earning,
she had the dignity to divorce me.

846
00:47:36,919 --> 00:47:41,519
You dare to speak ill of her?
Come here boy, I'll kill you!

847
00:47:41,559 --> 00:47:43,439
I didn't! You said that
the driver cheated you!

848
00:47:43,479 --> 00:47:48,199
Does that mean he took my wife?
Taking my vehicle away is cheating, too.

849
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:49,640
What!? The vehicle is gone?

850
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:52,800
Why do you panic
like you financed it?

851
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:55,880
- What about the slipper in the vehicle?
- You came here for the slipper?

852
00:47:55,919 --> 00:47:58,320
You didn't come to pay condolence
for the missing vehicle?

853
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:00,640
My god!
My god!

854
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:02,160
How many days since
it went missing?

855
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:04,040
It's been four days.

856
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:06,239
You heard her, it's been four
days since it went missing.

857
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:08,160
If you keep weeping, how will you
find the vehicle?

858
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:11,439
Let's do something. I have a photo
of the vehicle and my slipper.

859
00:48:11,479 --> 00:48:14,280
Let's place an advertisement in
every newspaper in Tamil Nadu.

860
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:16,200
- And then?
- We'll give it to TV channels, too.

861
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:19,360
Every channel will say 'Missing Vehicle'.
Then we can find it!

862
00:48:20,959 --> 00:48:22,679
Okay, but first I need
to know something.

863
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:23,320
What?

864
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:25,039
What will be the package
cost for all this?

865
00:48:25,079 --> 00:48:26,360
Not much.

866
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:28,680
half a million for TV channels
and another half for newspapers.

867
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:30,120
Totally one million.

868
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:30,800
Please?

869
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:34,880
Don't trust him, he
will ruin your life.

870
00:48:34,919 --> 00:48:35,880
Wait, mother.

871
00:48:36,119 --> 00:48:37,880
I'll break your other arm!

872
00:48:37,919 --> 00:48:39,880
That rusty vehicle is
only worth 75 thousand.

873
00:48:39,919 --> 00:48:43,680
Want me to spend a million on it?
Is 'Foolish Susai' etched to my forehead?

874
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:44,919
I'll kill you!

875
00:48:44,959 --> 00:48:47,320
If all your papers are in order,
how will we make a living?

876
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:50,599
- Stop that mini truck.
- Stop, man. Pull over.

877
00:48:50,639 --> 00:48:52,839
That's enough.
I said stop!

878
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:55,919
Where are you running?
Stop him.

879
00:48:55,959 --> 00:48:57,959
- Tell me, sir.
- You'd reported a lost mini truck?

880
00:48:57,999 --> 00:49:00,079
Yes, it went missing.

881
00:49:00,119 --> 00:49:01,999
Whose name is it registered in?

882
00:49:02,039 --> 00:49:04,360
Susai Transport is written in bold.

883
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:05,919
Ask him about my slipper?

884
00:49:05,959 --> 00:49:07,360
There is no Susai written here.

885
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:08,519
Other identifications?

886
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:11,159
In the back, it reads,
'Please keep 10 m distance'.

887
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:14,439
'Don't come close. Sound Horn.
Stop.'

888
00:49:14,479 --> 00:49:16,039
'Diesel' at the fuel tank.

889
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:18,880
In the radiator, in cursive letters,
'Maintain me properly'.

890
00:49:18,919 --> 00:49:21,439
- Stupid idiot!
- Yes, sir?

891
00:49:21,519 --> 00:49:25,199
These are common for all vehicles.
Tell me if there's anything unique.

892
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:28,640
- Please ask him once, brother.
- Sir...

893
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:35,360
Sir, to prevent my vehicle getting jinxed,
I've tied a lady's slipper under it.

894
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:37,680
You've tied a lady's slipper?

895
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:40,679
The slipper is here. It is.

896
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:43,200
- Really? It's there?
- Yes, a pink slipper.

897
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:46,680
It reads 'Solea'.
Is that your wife's name?

898
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:50,480
- It's the slipper's brand name.
- Pick it up from the station.

899
00:49:50,519 --> 00:49:52,759
- I'll come to the station, sir.
- Is the slipper there?

900
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:55,080
- The vehicle has been found.
- But it's my slipper!

901
00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:56,799
Could be.
But the vehicle is mine.

902
00:49:56,840 --> 00:49:59,680
- Brother...
- God Almighty!

903
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:06,639
In the name of the Father, and of the Son,
and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.

904
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:09,119
What are you doing?

905
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:12,440
You're saying thanks for your vehicle,
and I for my slipper.

906
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:14,319
There he is.

907
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:16,880
- Oh, be careful!
- Watch out!

908
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:19,919
No brakes, sir!

909
00:50:19,959 --> 00:50:22,840
No helmet, or hair on your head?
or brakes in your scooter?

910
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:25,240
- What do you have?
- I have my vehicle here!

911
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:28,039
You come free with the scooter? Get off!
Put the stand on.

912
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:30,079
My vehicle has been found!

913
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:33,040
I've found my vehicle again.

914
00:50:33,959 --> 00:50:35,559
Only the rope is there!

915
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:39,800
I've found my vehicle!
Oh yes.

916
00:50:49,079 --> 00:50:50,239
Move over.

917
00:50:55,439 --> 00:50:57,959
Jesus has sent you to me.
I'm so grateful!

918
00:50:57,999 --> 00:51:01,519
You have no gratitude?
You found your vehicle with my slipper.

919
00:51:01,559 --> 00:51:03,239
Now you're not showing
any seriousness.

920
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:05,360
What's with your slipper?
Take mine.

921
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:07,800
He set a battalion for me.
He will do that for you also.

922
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:09,959
He will find your slipper
like he found my vehicle.

923
00:51:09,999 --> 00:51:11,719
Write a complaint to the officer.

924
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:14,200
It's a slipper case?
You wait for a bit.

925
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:17,120
- You don't leave anything, do you?
- Susai, you're a funny guy.

926
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:20,720
You've got a new client now.
He'll cover this month's house rent.

927
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:23,120
The inspector is in there.
Take care of him.

928
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:26,680
- I don't even want my vehicle then.
- Just do your best, go on.

929
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:28,800
Go on, man.

930
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:32,519
Leave me alone. I'll never complain
at the police station about anything again.

931
00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:35,119
Even if my wife goes missing,
I won't come to the police station.

932
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:39,120
Please, nobody go in there.
Baldie, where are you going?

933
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:40,440
They'll strip you off everything.

934
00:51:40,479 --> 00:51:42,719
Sir, why is he crying so much?

935
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:45,880
It was a missing cycle case
and we asked for 10 thousand.

936
00:51:45,919 --> 00:51:48,280
He's being so dramatic for that!
You go on inside.

937
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:50,039
Ten thousand for cycle?

938
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:52,239
They'll strip my undies
for my mini truck!

939
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:53,479
Why is your arm broken?

940
00:51:53,519 --> 00:51:56,199
Sir, please tell me
where that slipper is?

941
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:59,640
There are lots of extra fittings
while finding a missing vehicle.

942
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:01,680
The finders deserve to keep
something too, right?

943
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:03,800
We remove everything
before returning the vehicle.

944
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:07,160
Do whatever you want, sir.
Please just give me that slipper.

945
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:10,160
That was an extra fitting.
I gave it off for 6 bucks.

946
00:52:18,919 --> 00:52:21,079
Little one.
Daddy is on the way to the site.

947
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:22,799
Are you sleeping in on Sunday?

948
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:23,959
Sleep tight.

949
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:29,280
Isn't it Abhi's birthday?
Convey my wishes to her.

950
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:30,959
Are you going out
somewhere to eat?

951
00:52:30,999 --> 00:52:33,719
Make sure you are back home
safe and early.

952
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:34,560
Okay?

953
00:52:36,959 --> 00:52:37,840
Father!

954
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:40,800
Where are you, father?

955
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:43,999
I'm always listening to
your voice messages.

956
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:47,400
But none of the messages I send
are reaching you.

957
00:52:48,919 --> 00:52:53,400
If someone is listening,
please show him this message.

958
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:55,320
My father...

959
00:52:56,519 --> 00:52:58,599
My father is a good man.

960
00:52:58,639 --> 00:53:00,519
Please let him go.

961
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:17,240
Is anybody here?

962
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:19,479
Basheer Bhai?

963
00:53:22,439 --> 00:53:25,159
Always falls asleep
with the TV on.

964
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:28,880
Wake up, son.

965
00:53:29,919 --> 00:53:31,680
- Wake up!
- What is it, mom?

966
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:34,320
You'll just sleep on the sofa
with the TV on?

967
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:36,039
Go sleep inside.

968
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:38,320
You never study.

969
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:46,680
- Hello.
- Where are you?

970
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:49,640
- I'll come, mom.
- It's late and it's raining too!

971
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:51,560
I'm waiting somewhere
for the rain to subside.

972
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:54,079
You've been roaming around more
since you broke your arm.

973
00:53:54,119 --> 00:53:55,439
I'll come once the rain stops.

974
00:53:55,479 --> 00:53:57,280
Okay, come soon.
Be safe.

975
00:54:00,919 --> 00:54:03,439
Some homeless beggar
is sleeping outside the shop.

976
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:07,439
Son!

977
00:54:07,519 --> 00:54:09,759
Who are you?
Why are you sleeping outside the shop?

978
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:12,039
- Hello, Bhai.
- 'Hello Bhai'?

979
00:54:12,079 --> 00:54:14,079
Do I look like a Muslim to you?
I'm Velu.

980
00:54:14,119 --> 00:54:15,999
- Velu from the salon.
- When will Bhai come?

981
00:54:16,039 --> 00:54:18,599
He'll come later. Tell me now,
do you want a cut or a shave?

982
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:20,559
Son...

983
00:54:20,999 --> 00:54:23,079
Son, does it feel good?

984
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:28,479
- Hello, Bhai.
- He's here?

985
00:54:28,519 --> 00:54:30,519
Wait, it's not done yet.

986
00:54:31,079 --> 00:54:34,159
- Why is he in such a hurry?
- Good morning, Bhai.

987
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:36,680
Bhai! Bhai! Bhai!

988
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:38,880
- Bhai!
- Stupid oaf.

989
00:54:38,919 --> 00:54:40,680
You disturb my prayer.
Who are you?

990
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:43,560
- I came to see you, Bhai.
- You came to the salon.

991
00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:45,919
- What is the matter?
- I really came to see you, Bhai.

992
00:54:45,959 --> 00:54:49,159
This slipper in the photo?
I want it, Bhai.

993
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:50,919
The policeman sold
it to you for 6 bucks.

994
00:54:50,959 --> 00:54:51,679
Show me?

995
00:54:53,119 --> 00:54:56,119
- The pink slipper. Paragon brand.
- That's right, Bhai.

996
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:57,400
I know it too well.

997
00:54:57,439 --> 00:54:59,360
I want that slipper, Bhai.

998
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:03,360
Do you want that same slipper
or another one like it?

999
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:07,200
I want that same slipper.
Money is not a problem, I'll pay anything.

1000
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:09,240
Just give me that slipper, Bhai.
Please!

1001
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:12,479
If you want the same slipper,
come tomorrow at 11 AM.

1002
00:55:12,519 --> 00:55:15,280
No way, Bhai. I waited here all night
in the pouring rain.

1003
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:18,919
It will take you five minutes to get it.
If you're busy, I'll take it myself.

1004
00:55:18,959 --> 00:55:21,320
- Who are you to search my shop?
- Please, Bhai.

1005
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:24,479
I need it. I'm begging you.
Please give it to me, Bhai.

1006
00:55:24,519 --> 00:55:27,039
- Please, Bhai.
- You sound like a beggar!

1007
00:55:27,079 --> 00:55:29,959
With one arm, for one slipper.

1008
00:55:29,999 --> 00:55:32,439
A lady's slipper, too.

1009
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:35,039
What?
Is it love?

1010
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:39,680
- The girl is very pretty?
- She's amazing.

1011
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:42,280
Bhai, my arm!

1012
00:55:42,639 --> 00:55:44,879
How many of you are
going after this girl?

1013
00:55:46,119 --> 00:55:48,359
- You're counting?
- 7 totally, Bhai.

1014
00:55:48,439 --> 00:55:50,439
- Seven?
- As far as I know, 7.

1015
00:55:50,479 --> 00:55:52,679
- Including me, it's 8.
- 8 of you?

1016
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:55,120
- This is the problem.
- What?

1017
00:55:55,479 --> 00:55:57,559
One of those 8 took
that slipper yesterday!

1018
00:55:57,599 --> 00:55:58,759
What do you mean?

1019
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:01,840
Falling in love is the easy part.
You must be swift.

1020
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:05,400
- Who was it?
- You're too late, boy.

1021
00:56:05,479 --> 00:56:06,999
Tell me, who was it?

1022
00:56:07,039 --> 00:56:09,159
Someone bought it for
100 bucks five minutes...

1023
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:10,919
...after the policeman sold it to me.

1024
00:56:10,959 --> 00:56:12,840
But who was it?

1025
00:56:12,919 --> 00:56:15,439
I'm not selling sim
cards to get ID proof!

1026
00:56:15,479 --> 00:56:19,079
- I found a scapegoat and sold it.
- How did he look?

1027
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:19,920
Bhai, tell me.

1028
00:56:19,959 --> 00:56:22,919
I can see him in my mind.
But I can't describe him.

1029
00:56:22,959 --> 00:56:27,880
Was it the fat, dark guy
with a paunch and curly hair?

1030
00:56:27,919 --> 00:56:30,439
No, he wasn't fat.

1031
00:56:30,479 --> 00:56:33,760
Or was it the skinny guy
with thick glasses?

1032
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:35,800
He was neither skinny nor fat.

1033
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:37,960
So not him, either?

1034
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:41,439
Does he speak Tamil
with a Kannada slang?

1035
00:56:41,519 --> 00:56:42,439
The Bangalore guy?

1036
00:56:42,479 --> 00:56:44,479
He spoke Tamil fluently.

1037
00:56:47,439 --> 00:56:48,959
Who was it, then?

1038
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:53,479
Bhai, the 6 bucks may have
meant something to those policemen.

1039
00:56:53,519 --> 00:56:55,840
And 100 bucks may
mean something to you.

1040
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:58,479
To that girl,
her father means everything.

1041
00:56:58,519 --> 00:57:01,679
Bhai, they're all terrible people.

1042
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:04,000
I gain nothing from this.

1043
00:57:04,039 --> 00:57:06,759
I'm searching it for that girl.

1044
00:57:07,320 --> 00:57:10,080
Please tell me
where that slipper is, Bhai.

1045
00:57:10,999 --> 00:57:12,199
Please, Bhai.

1046
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:16,280
I'm begging you, Bhai.
Please tell me where it is.

1047
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:18,640
I need that slipper, Bhai.

1048
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:21,599
I'm begging you, Bhai.

1049
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:23,560
Where is that slipper?

1050
00:57:24,119 --> 00:57:26,359
Please, Bhai.
Where is that slipper?

1051
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:29,720
I need that slipper, Bhai.

1052
00:57:39,959 --> 00:57:44,439
'It will continue to pour...'

1053
00:57:44,919 --> 00:57:46,240
Allah!

1054
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:48,959
Let today's business fare well.

1055
00:57:55,240 --> 00:57:58,040
I told you so many times,
why do you trouble me so?

1056
00:57:58,119 --> 00:58:01,359
Bhai, I didn't come to your shop.
I'm only standing on the road.

1057
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:03,519
I'm going to whack you!

1058
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:09,800
Bhai, those boys are from her colony.
Check if it's them?

1059
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:11,479
Look, they're going in the bike.

1060
00:58:11,519 --> 00:58:14,360
Is it my job to look at
passersby on the road?

1061
00:58:14,439 --> 00:58:16,999
Unlike you, I have a job.

1062
00:58:17,039 --> 00:58:18,639
I need to work to pay my bills.
Fool!

1063
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:21,320
- How much do you make in a day, Bhai?
- Why?

1064
00:58:21,439 --> 00:58:24,240
- Just tell me.
- Between 1,000 and 2,000.

1065
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:26,479
- Fine, let's make a deal.
- What deal?

1066
00:58:26,519 --> 00:58:28,439
I'll pay you 1,500.

1067
00:58:28,479 --> 00:58:32,959
You stand here all day
and point me to the guy?

1068
00:58:33,039 --> 00:58:35,320
- I like this deal.
- Are you in?

1069
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:36,919
Pay me an advance first.

1070
00:58:37,519 --> 00:58:39,800
- An advance?
- Looks like he's carrying a wad of cash.

1071
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:41,840
Take 500 rupees from this.

1072
00:58:41,959 --> 00:58:44,439
I don't want an advance.
Pay me the full amount.

1073
00:58:44,479 --> 00:58:45,959
You don't trust me?

1074
00:58:45,999 --> 00:58:47,959
Why should I trust you?
What if you run away?

1075
00:58:47,999 --> 00:58:50,639
Fine, then. Keep this.
That's 1,500.

1076
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:53,760
Bhai, you must report to duty
first thing in the morning.

1077
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:55,840
Basheer Bhai is synonymous
with punctuality.

1078
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:58,680
Watch me at my job.
Here, watch me.

1079
00:58:59,039 --> 00:59:01,119
Right. Left.

1080
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:02,160
Right.

1081
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:03,720
Keep doing this and
we'll find them, Bhai.

1082
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:04,680
Really?

1083
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:06,040
- Thanks, Bhai!
- You're happy?

1084
00:59:06,079 --> 00:59:07,400
Of course. Thanks!

1085
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:10,400
- I'll see you.
- Okay!

1086
00:59:11,439 --> 00:59:13,679
He's given me money
and is walking away happily?

1087
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:16,720
Boys these days go crazy for love.

1088
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:41,480
"Like a thief who creeps in at night;
Love has usurped my heart."

1089
00:59:41,519 --> 00:59:45,800
"My heart is stolen;
And so I'm gone."

1090
00:59:46,919 --> 00:59:51,680
"Like a thief who creeps in at night;
Love has usurped my heart."

1091
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:55,959
"My heart is stolen;
And so I'm gone."

1092
00:59:57,400 --> 01:00:01,959
"Even if you fail;
One should fall in love."

1093
01:00:01,999 --> 01:00:07,599
"To resist it is futile;
It always finds a way in."

1094
01:00:07,639 --> 01:00:12,239
"Even if you fail;
One should fall in love."

1095
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:17,600
"To resist it is futile;
It always finds a way in."

1096
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:27,280
"If falling in love is a mistake...
That mistake is not a mistake."

1097
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:32,240
"And no one has ever escaped it."

1098
01:00:32,999 --> 01:00:42,599
"If falling in love is a mistake...
That mistake is not a mistake."

1099
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:47,240
"And no one has ever escaped it."

1100
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:52,880
"Like a thief who creeps in at night;
Love has usurped my heart."

1101
01:00:52,919 --> 01:00:57,599
"My heart is stolen;
And so I'm gone."

1102
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:41,479
"All I did was blink my eye;
And I saw your vision, like a deity."

1103
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:51,760
"All I did was blink my eye;
And I saw your vision, like a deity."

1104
01:01:52,320 --> 01:02:02,559
"Even I didn't know where my soul lies;
But somehow you found a way into it."

1105
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:12,880
"Living in a chaotic climate;
dying daily from love sickness."

1106
01:02:12,919 --> 01:02:18,360
"Love shows the path
between life and death"

1107
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:23,039
"Its trapped me in such intense agony."

1108
01:02:23,360 --> 01:02:32,999
"If falling in love is a mistake...
That mistake is not a mistake."

1109
01:02:33,079 --> 01:02:38,239
"And no one has ever escaped it."

1110
01:02:47,479 --> 01:02:48,639
Right.

1111
01:02:48,919 --> 01:02:49,919
Left.

1112
01:02:49,959 --> 01:02:51,079
Right.

1113
01:02:51,599 --> 01:02:52,360
Left.

1114
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:53,519
Thirty bucks.

1115
01:03:00,119 --> 01:03:01,519
But where is Bhai?

1116
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:03,240
Bhai! Bhai!

1117
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:06,439
Bhai, where are you?
You ran away with my money?

1118
01:03:06,479 --> 01:03:08,519
Bhai, people are passing by.

1119
01:03:08,599 --> 01:03:09,639
Bhai!

1120
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:12,160
Bhai, where did you go?
People are passing by!

1121
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:13,360
I'd gone to pee.

1122
01:03:13,400 --> 01:03:15,999
- So many people have already passed.
- You're going overboard.

1123
01:03:16,039 --> 01:03:17,880
I don't even have the right to pee?

1124
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:19,479
This is too much.

1125
01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:21,479
Give me that.

1126
01:03:22,599 --> 01:03:25,079
- Is it heated?
- I'm pretty heated myself.

1127
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:28,119
Where are you going now?

1128
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:31,080
- I'm going to eat.
- Why can't you eat out here?

1129
01:03:31,119 --> 01:03:33,479
What if a crow shits on my food?

1130
01:03:33,519 --> 01:03:37,519
- This is too much, really.
- Come here, I'll hold an umbrella.

1131
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:38,880
You better.

1132
01:03:42,519 --> 01:03:45,919
Bhai, don't focus on your food.
Look at the road.

1133
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:49,800
You paid me 1,500
but make me work for 150 thousand!

1134
01:03:49,840 --> 01:03:50,680
Let me eat.

1135
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:52,880
Watch with your eyes
and eat with your hands.

1136
01:03:52,919 --> 01:03:54,999
Then let go of my hand.

1137
01:03:55,959 --> 01:03:58,760
- Bhai, look at those two in the bike.
- Can't see their faces.

1138
01:03:58,840 --> 01:04:01,439
If everyone wears a helmet,
how will we find our guy?

1139
01:04:01,479 --> 01:04:04,360
He cares about his life
like you care about your girl.

1140
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:05,959
Let me eat!

1141
01:04:10,479 --> 01:04:12,400
- Bhai?
- No, no.

1142
01:04:13,360 --> 01:04:15,280
- Bhai!
- No.

1143
01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:17,120
Bhai, Bhai, Bhai.

1144
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:21,560
- He's here.
- Where?

1145
01:04:21,599 --> 01:04:22,719
Over there.

1146
01:04:24,439 --> 01:04:25,200
This guy?

1147
01:04:25,240 --> 01:04:26,520
- Hello, Bhai.
- Why so late?

1148
01:04:26,559 --> 01:04:29,239
It's not like there are
customers lined up!

1149
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:33,680
You get to eat and earn sitting there.
I'm not so lucky.

1150
01:04:34,840 --> 01:04:36,039
Take this.

1151
01:04:36,999 --> 01:04:39,760
He gets me food.
But he doesn't let me eat.

1152
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:42,959
- No tea?
- He buys tea, but won't let me drink.

1153
01:04:43,039 --> 01:04:44,959
Carry on, then.
I'll go eat.

1154
01:04:44,999 --> 01:04:46,639
At least you get to eat.

1155
01:04:48,639 --> 01:04:50,479
Right. Left.

1156
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:52,600
Right. Left.

1157
01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:56,680
He's paid me but has taken over
my duty.

1158
01:04:56,959 --> 01:04:58,720
Love is not nothing!

1159
01:05:00,079 --> 01:05:01,719
Brother, three hot teas.

1160
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:03,880
- It's for Basheer Bhai.
- He comes here usually to drink.

1161
01:05:03,919 --> 01:05:05,720
Not today.
He's busy.

1162
01:05:15,559 --> 01:05:16,599
Brother...

1163
01:05:16,919 --> 01:05:19,079
My slipper broke.
Can you fix it for me?

1164
01:05:19,119 --> 01:05:22,159
- Leave it there, pick it up tomorrow.
- I'm in a hurry.

1165
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:25,720
- Then go to another shop.
- Please fix it for me. Please?

1166
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:27,999
You're not busy.
Why can't you stitch it?

1167
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:30,760
What did you just say?

1168
01:05:31,039 --> 01:05:33,840
- I just said--
- You think being jobless is easy?

1169
01:05:33,959 --> 01:05:36,199
Do you have any idea
how difficult this is?

1170
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:37,919
Just clear out this place

1171
01:05:37,959 --> 01:05:39,840
Please fix it for me?

1172
01:05:39,880 --> 01:05:42,160
If you knew who she is...

1173
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:43,480
What do I care?

1174
01:05:43,519 --> 01:05:45,199
You're pulling strings to
get your slipper fixed?

1175
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:46,320
Leave me alone.

1176
01:05:46,360 --> 01:05:47,280
Bhai!

1177
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:50,040
- What?
- Don't you recognise this girl?

1178
01:05:50,119 --> 01:05:50,919
No.

1179
01:05:50,999 --> 01:05:53,599
She's engineer Mohanraj's daughter.
He's made our town so famous.

1180
01:05:53,639 --> 01:05:55,639
You should read the papers.
Stitch it for her.

1181
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:56,720
That's the girl?

1182
01:05:56,760 --> 01:05:57,600
Yes

1183
01:05:57,639 --> 01:05:58,799
Now I remember.

1184
01:05:59,880 --> 01:06:01,240
But he'll be here!

1185
01:06:01,519 --> 01:06:02,840
Give me that.

1186
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:04,439
Keep an eye out for him.

1187
01:06:04,479 --> 01:06:06,400
I shouldn't have taken that money

1188
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:13,640
Go! Why do you ask that?

1189
01:06:14,039 --> 01:06:15,639
- Thank you!
- Is it alright?

1190
01:06:16,360 --> 01:06:17,360
Here...

1191
01:06:17,999 --> 01:06:18,760
No thanks.

1192
01:06:18,840 --> 01:06:21,240
- You've come on TV!
- No, please keep it.

1193
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:22,320
Bye.

1194
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:25,600
- Let's go.
- Ride safe.

1195
01:06:25,639 --> 01:06:26,959
Miss, wait up!

1196
01:06:27,039 --> 01:06:30,479
- What?
- I forgot to get her phone number.

1197
01:06:30,519 --> 01:06:32,559
- Now she's gone.
- Who are you talking to?

1198
01:06:32,639 --> 01:06:33,999
I forgot to get that girl's number...

1199
01:06:34,079 --> 01:06:35,479
Bhai, what happened?

1200
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:37,880
I am doing your job only!

1201
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:41,240
- Why did they come here?
- You took so long to buy tea?

1202
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:42,999
Tell me, Bhai.
Why did they come here?

1203
01:06:43,039 --> 01:06:45,599
They came to get a slipper mended.

1204
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:46,800
See?

1205
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:48,320
She paid me ten rupees.

1206
01:06:48,360 --> 01:06:51,720
I'm working for you today,
so you take this money.

1207
01:06:51,919 --> 01:06:53,039
Keep it.

1208
01:06:53,119 --> 01:06:58,639
You know, this girl is that guy Mohanraj...
the one who was kidnapped his daughter!

1209
01:06:58,680 --> 01:06:59,560
Bhai...

1210
01:06:59,639 --> 01:07:01,799
I'm doing all this for her only.

1211
01:07:02,320 --> 01:07:04,479
Are you serious?

1212
01:07:04,559 --> 01:07:07,039
- Yes, Bhai.
- Does the girl know about this?

1213
01:07:07,880 --> 01:07:10,959
I've read about it.
That love is madness.

1214
01:07:11,119 --> 01:07:12,599
Now I'm seeing it.

1215
01:07:13,039 --> 01:07:15,199
That girl is way out of your league.

1216
01:07:15,639 --> 01:07:18,359
But that's okay.
You're a good guy.

1217
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:24,800
Problem is, girls these days don't seem to
fall in love with good guys.

1218
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:35,439
It's time!

1219
01:07:36,360 --> 01:07:39,079
It's Friday, I must go to pray.
You keep watch, I'm going.

1220
01:07:39,119 --> 01:07:43,759
You said you'd work all day,
but now you're going to pray?

1221
01:07:43,959 --> 01:07:46,119
I'll whack you.
What do you think?

1222
01:07:46,280 --> 01:07:50,240
You think prayer is a joke?
It's more important than anything else.

1223
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:53,120
Just because you paid me...
Wait, I'll return your money!

1224
01:07:53,160 --> 01:07:55,880
We've worked so hard
since morning.

1225
01:07:55,919 --> 01:07:56,800
Please, Bhai.

1226
01:07:56,840 --> 01:08:00,320
If he passes by when you go
to pray, it'll all go to waste.

1227
01:08:00,360 --> 01:08:03,439
I will apologise to Allah
for you, just for today.

1228
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:05,160
Please, Bhai.

1229
01:08:05,559 --> 01:08:08,439
God won't get angry if you
help someone in need.

1230
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:38,320
Bhai, there's a bike--

1231
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:04,240
Son...

1232
01:09:05,160 --> 01:09:08,240
- Has Bhai ordered biryani for lunch?
- Was the pongal not enough?

1233
01:09:08,280 --> 01:09:10,479
I'm trying to help you here.

1234
01:09:10,559 --> 01:09:13,959
I know most of Bhai's customers.
Like how I know you.

1235
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,320
- You and I shall make a deal?
- What's the deal?

1236
01:09:16,360 --> 01:09:19,240
Just give me
half of what you're paying him.

1237
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:20,719
And I'll identify him for you.

1238
01:09:21,439 --> 01:09:22,960
Just go away.

1239
01:09:24,799 --> 01:09:27,879
You're going to be stuck here forever.
Suit yourself.

1240
01:09:39,479 --> 01:09:40,519
Bhai

1241
01:09:41,080 --> 01:09:43,320
Normally, I only chant my prayers.

1242
01:09:43,759 --> 01:09:46,039
For the first time, I've prayed for you.

1243
01:09:46,519 --> 01:09:50,120
And let me tell you this.
Allah will surely help you find him.

1244
01:09:50,439 --> 01:09:51,719
Really.

1245
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:04,960
- Bhai, who is it?
- That's him!

1246
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,560
- Who?
- That's him, with the red cap.

1247
01:10:07,639 --> 01:10:09,959
He's talking over the phone!
That's the guy.

1248
01:10:11,599 --> 01:10:13,079
Insha Allah!

1249
01:10:32,799 --> 01:10:34,039
Don't you cry.

1250
01:10:35,160 --> 01:10:36,800
Dad will be fine.

1251
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:40,920
It pains me to see you
roaming in the streets.

1252
01:10:41,799 --> 01:10:44,320
It's my responsibility to
bring your father back to you.

1253
01:10:44,360 --> 01:10:45,799
- What happened to your arm?
- Hold on, I'll tell you.

1254
01:10:45,839 --> 01:10:48,159
Do you know, I've not eaten
or slept in days.

1255
01:10:48,439 --> 01:10:50,479
I went to meet the minister
for you, just now.

1256
01:10:50,519 --> 01:10:51,679
Don't cry!

1257
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,360
- What happened to your arm?
- I'll tell you.

1258
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:55,559
One minute, dear.

1259
01:10:55,639 --> 01:10:58,799
You look really smart.
What's your name?

1260
01:10:58,879 --> 01:11:00,559
- V. Sandhya Shri.
- Come again?

1261
01:11:00,599 --> 01:11:02,479
- V. Sandhya Shri.
- Really?

1262
01:11:02,559 --> 01:11:03,719
Yes, uncle.

1263
01:11:04,719 --> 01:11:06,919
You're a good kid.
Study well.

1264
01:11:08,120 --> 01:11:11,920
I saw a beautiful, intelligent girl here
with your name.

1265
01:11:11,960 --> 01:11:13,520
Sandhya Shri.

1266
01:11:16,040 --> 01:11:19,040
You take this route every day.
Don't you know it costs 11 bucks?

1267
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:22,360
Must I give you 9 bucks change every day?
I don't have change, give me a rupee.

1268
01:11:22,479 --> 01:11:24,240
I would have given you change
if I had it.

1269
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:26,000
Don't be a pain!

1270
01:11:26,040 --> 01:11:28,240
Buddy, let me give you a rupee.

1271
01:11:29,759 --> 01:11:32,320
Thanks! I'll pay you back
at the shore.

1272
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:34,360
Here, take it.

1273
01:11:34,439 --> 01:11:36,719
- Learn to respect the customer.
- Look at his face!

1274
01:11:36,759 --> 01:11:39,239
That guy should be locked up.

1275
01:11:39,439 --> 01:11:42,200
Son. Do you have a change
of 6 rupees?

1276
01:11:42,719 --> 01:11:44,039
You gave him.

1277
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:47,280
Here.

1278
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:51,200
I don't have change.
Give me a rupee.

1279
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:53,400
I'd have given you
if I had it! One moment...

1280
01:11:53,960 --> 01:11:55,000
Son...

1281
01:11:55,040 --> 01:11:57,240
- What is your problem?
- Thank you very much.

1282
01:11:57,360 --> 01:12:00,160
I've come to meet the minister's P.A.
I'll call you back later.

1283
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:02,080
If I hear any complaints, I'll kill you.

1284
01:12:02,120 --> 01:12:03,920
Hello, boss!
How are you?

1285
01:12:03,960 --> 01:12:05,680
Welcome, Mahesh.
You got delayed?

1286
01:12:05,719 --> 01:12:07,719
- Family stress!
- Just relax.

1287
01:12:07,759 --> 01:12:09,599
Attend to Mahesh.

1288
01:12:09,679 --> 01:12:11,679
- He's a regular customer.
- Okay, boss.

1289
01:12:11,759 --> 01:12:13,400
- Make it quick.
- Okay, brother.

1290
01:12:13,439 --> 01:12:15,839
(Liquor consumption/smoking
is injurious to health)

1291
01:12:17,839 --> 01:12:20,479
Bro! Your one rupee...

1292
01:12:22,160 --> 01:12:26,120
You came all the way for one rupee?
You must have spent 15 rupees on it.

1293
01:12:26,639 --> 01:12:28,999
Sit down, then.
Let's get square with drinks.

1294
01:12:30,120 --> 01:12:33,080
- What happened to your arm?
- Give me your hand!

1295
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:36,200
- You'll have a great life.
- Oh. You're an astrologer?

1296
01:12:36,240 --> 01:12:38,360
- No, the girl you spoke to in the boat?
- Yeah...

1297
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:40,839
- I heard that.
- You're an eavesdropper?

1298
01:12:40,879 --> 01:12:43,239
The girl you're in love with
I'm also--

1299
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:44,080
You're also what?

1300
01:12:44,120 --> 01:12:45,840
I'm in love with her, too.

1301
01:12:46,360 --> 01:12:49,559
So many boys are behind my girl.
She's that pretty.

1302
01:12:49,599 --> 01:12:51,719
How long now?
Months or years?

1303
01:12:51,759 --> 01:12:54,479
- Just six months now.
- You're still an apprentice then.

1304
01:12:55,160 --> 01:12:58,080
I'm a feeler.
But you're a field worker.

1305
01:12:58,120 --> 01:13:00,800
- Thanks, bro.
- You toil so much for your girl.

1306
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:04,920
Your love will be a success for sure.
I'll stand by you for your problems.

1307
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,160
That's not necessary, bro.

1308
01:13:10,519 --> 01:13:14,400
If you really want to help me,
please stop going behind my girl.

1309
01:13:14,439 --> 01:13:16,719
That's the greatest favour you could
ever do for me.

1310
01:13:16,759 --> 01:13:18,239
How many people can I manage?

1311
01:13:18,280 --> 01:13:20,400
You wanted me to kill the guy
who was going after your girl

1312
01:13:20,439 --> 01:13:21,400
Yes

1313
01:13:21,439 --> 01:13:23,719
- Now there's a new guy.
- What?

1314
01:13:23,799 --> 01:13:25,279
He, too, loves her.

1315
01:13:25,320 --> 01:13:25,960
Is it?

1316
01:13:26,040 --> 01:13:29,240
- He says he'll stand by her.
- Kill him, too.

1317
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:30,160
Okay!

1318
01:13:30,200 --> 01:13:31,599
He's asking me to kill them both?

1319
01:13:31,639 --> 01:13:32,959
Ask him to pay more.

1320
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:34,680
It'll cost you more, okay?

1321
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:36,839
Money doesn't matter.
Only prestige!

1322
01:13:36,879 --> 01:13:38,159
Kill them both.

1323
01:13:38,200 --> 01:13:40,200
- Drink up, bro.
- I don't have these habits.

1324
01:13:40,240 --> 01:13:42,360
- Some other brand then?
- I'll just have a cold drink.

1325
01:13:42,439 --> 01:13:44,080
Just a cold drink?

1326
01:13:44,240 --> 01:13:46,160
- Are you a school kid?
- Visual communication final year.

1327
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:47,400
Then you must take the hit.

1328
01:13:47,439 --> 01:13:49,000
I will hit.

1329
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:50,800
I will take this hit
and then hit.

1330
01:13:52,280 --> 01:13:54,519
He's left the fruit salad behind?

1331
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,320
- What are you doing?
- We'll just eat and come?

1332
01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:03,719
- Come on now.
- He spat on me!

1333
01:14:03,799 --> 01:14:07,199
Who are you?
Why are you hitting me?

1334
01:14:07,240 --> 01:14:09,320
You hit them.
I'll take a hit from this!

1335
01:14:10,639 --> 01:14:11,919
It hurts!

1336
01:14:12,639 --> 01:14:15,439
Stop now.
Mahesh is my regular customer.

1337
01:14:15,479 --> 01:14:18,280
Don't know who this buffalo is.
He punched my chest!

1338
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:21,160
- This is my bar.
- So what?

1339
01:14:21,200 --> 01:14:22,519
Hit them outside.

1340
01:14:24,360 --> 01:14:26,200
Please don't hit me, sir.
It hurts!

1341
01:14:26,280 --> 01:14:28,280
What did I do?

1342
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:32,200
Clean up the table.
Attend to the next customer.

1343
01:14:32,240 --> 01:14:33,000
Okay boss

1344
01:14:33,080 --> 01:14:36,720
You said there's a new guy
in love with my girl...give him the phone.

1345
01:14:36,759 --> 01:14:39,280
- Lift that guy up.
- Here, talk.

1346
01:14:39,320 --> 01:14:40,799
Hello, who are you?

1347
01:14:40,879 --> 01:14:43,479
- Why are you hitting me?
- I'm the girl's father.

1348
01:14:43,599 --> 01:14:45,039
How do you have a phone?

1349
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:46,840
If you pay money,
you get everything here.

1350
01:14:46,879 --> 01:14:49,919
- Oh! Terrorists take bribes too?
- What are you blabbering?

1351
01:14:49,960 --> 01:14:52,160
I've been locked up under Goondas Act
in Coimbatore Jail.

1352
01:14:52,240 --> 01:14:54,639
- Sir, you are Sandhya's father?
- What? Sandhya's father?

1353
01:14:54,679 --> 01:14:57,320
- What's your daughter's name then?
- Her name is Sripriya!

1354
01:14:57,360 --> 01:14:59,759
Sir, I don't even know who your
daughter is.

1355
01:14:59,799 --> 01:15:00,959
He's turned me in!

1356
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:02,880
Ask them to beat the guy who loves her.

1357
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:05,640
- Now three people will hit me!
- Why are they hitting me?

1358
01:15:05,719 --> 01:15:08,959
My arm is broken already.
Tell them they're not to hit me anymore.

1359
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:13,639
He doesn't even love my girl.
Why should I pay for you to kill him?

1360
01:15:13,679 --> 01:15:17,519
- He doesn't even know her.
- He's the one who said he loved her.

1361
01:15:17,599 --> 01:15:19,679
Have you at least got Mahesh?

1362
01:15:20,479 --> 01:15:21,879
Guy number 1 is the right one.

1363
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:24,080
Beat him to death
and then get your money.

1364
01:15:24,120 --> 01:15:25,960
He must never think about
my daughter again.

1365
01:15:26,040 --> 01:15:27,000
Okay, then.

1366
01:15:27,040 --> 01:15:29,840
- Will you think about her?
- I can't do it, brother.

1367
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:33,160
If not her, another girl.
If not the other girl, someone else.

1368
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:36,599
There are a million girls to love.
But my life...?

1369
01:15:36,639 --> 01:15:39,360
I only have one of those.
That's my only priority.

1370
01:15:39,439 --> 01:15:41,360
I'm not a crazy man like him.

1371
01:15:41,400 --> 01:15:44,280
I will never cross the river
and I will never see her again.

1372
01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:46,080
I swear this upon your tractor.

1373
01:15:46,839 --> 01:15:51,119
Should something happen to my tractor,
I'll run you over with it.

1374
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,920
Why did you take my girl's slipper
to love someone else?

1375
01:16:01,120 --> 01:16:03,800
It hurts! It hurts! It hurts!

1376
01:16:03,839 --> 01:16:06,639
When they hit you, you take it.
But when I hit you, you hit me back?

1377
01:16:06,719 --> 01:16:08,079
Are you and him the same?

1378
01:16:08,120 --> 01:16:10,160
He's a don.
You're a donkey.

1379
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:13,840
You mental! You ran after me
just for that slipper?

1380
01:16:13,879 --> 01:16:15,559
I want that slipper!

1381
01:16:16,120 --> 01:16:18,479
Mention the word 'slipper'
one more time, and...

1382
01:16:18,799 --> 01:16:20,119
I'll slipper you!

1383
01:16:20,200 --> 01:16:22,599
I don't ever want to see your face
in my life.

1384
01:16:22,639 --> 01:16:24,439
If I see you again,
I'll break your other arm.

1385
01:16:24,479 --> 01:16:25,599
Its paining

1386
01:16:25,759 --> 01:16:28,360
- I want that slipper!
- Get out of my sight.

1387
01:16:29,679 --> 01:16:32,679
- You hit me? I'll show you!
- Get lost.

1388
01:16:34,679 --> 01:16:36,559
Mr. Don!

1389
01:16:36,719 --> 01:16:38,919
Please wait.

1390
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:40,800
Please help me.

1391
01:16:40,879 --> 01:16:44,239
- It's like your bar. Visit often.
- Sure thing.

1392
01:16:44,679 --> 01:16:47,360
Welcome back, Mahesh.
They're done hitting you already?

1393
01:16:47,400 --> 01:16:48,120
Why?

1394
01:16:48,160 --> 01:16:50,360
You thought it would be the end of me?

1395
01:16:51,240 --> 01:16:52,920
Call yourself a gentleman?

1396
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:56,160
I've been drinking in your bar
for as long as I can remember.

1397
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:58,719
How could you
get me caught and stand watching?

1398
01:16:59,639 --> 01:17:03,200
- They beat me black and blue.
- Those men were new customers.

1399
01:17:03,280 --> 01:17:05,280
What would they think of our bar?

1400
01:17:05,519 --> 01:17:07,879
Look, Mahesh is here.
Take his order.

1401
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:10,800
Our boss is such a  big guy.
He's come in such a big vehicle.

1402
01:17:10,839 --> 01:17:13,079
The cops are hunting for him
with special teams.

1403
01:17:13,160 --> 01:17:14,639
You're calling him to
settle a slipper dispute?

1404
01:17:14,679 --> 01:17:15,879
Let's get going.

1405
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:18,320
(Liquor consumption/smoking
is injurious to health)

1406
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:25,120
Why has the dinosaur returned
in his tractor?

1407
01:17:35,879 --> 01:17:37,199
Go slow, man!
<b><font color="#ff0000"><i>MAZE HDRelease</i></font></b>

1408
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:38,599
Ask him where the slipper is, brother!

1409
01:17:38,639 --> 01:17:39,759
Mr. Don. Please hold this umbrella?

1410
01:17:39,799 --> 01:17:41,199
- I'm a don. How can I hold it?
- I'm getting a call.

1411
01:17:41,240 --> 01:17:42,360
Give it to him

1412
01:17:46,200 --> 01:17:47,679
- Hello?
- Junior.

1413
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:49,280
- Busy?
- What is it, leader?

1414
01:17:49,320 --> 01:17:53,400
Shanthi was a little upset.
I got her a cold drink.

1415
01:17:53,479 --> 01:17:57,040
She's shamelessly sipping away.
Can you come and pay?

1416
01:17:57,080 --> 01:17:59,680
I'm out on an important task
with an important person.

1417
01:17:59,719 --> 01:18:00,799
I'll talk later.

1418
01:18:00,879 --> 01:18:03,239
What's more important than
getting your arm's cast changed?

1419
01:18:03,320 --> 01:18:04,799
My foot!

1420
01:18:04,960 --> 01:18:07,240
- Is that even a comeback?
- Remo, what happened?

1421
01:18:07,759 --> 01:18:09,919
It's all good.
Order another juice.

1422
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,320
We haven't even paid
for the juices we drank.

1423
01:18:12,360 --> 01:18:13,400
You want another?

1424
01:18:13,439 --> 01:18:14,360
Yes

1425
01:18:15,240 --> 01:18:19,439
Call up your ex 'Brake' Pandi
and ask him to pay for all this.

1426
01:18:19,519 --> 01:18:21,200
- What about you?
- I'll stand in the back and watch.

1427
01:18:21,240 --> 01:18:21,880
Go

1428
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:23,720
- Is it this house?
- That's the one.

1429
01:18:23,759 --> 01:18:24,919
Go in and they'll slipper you.

1430
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:27,320
In this area, I'm the don.
Listen to me.

1431
01:18:27,400 --> 01:18:29,599
This is some other slipper.
Where's that one?

1432
01:18:29,639 --> 01:18:31,439
That's a good one.
Keep it.

1433
01:18:31,559 --> 01:18:32,679
It's a slipper you want?

1434
01:18:32,719 --> 01:18:35,360
Who cares about this wretched slipper?
I want mine.

1435
01:18:35,400 --> 01:18:37,240
Where is that slipper?

1436
01:18:37,439 --> 01:18:38,839
Over there...

1437
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,120
Look on top of the tree.

1438
01:18:43,360 --> 01:18:46,040
- Where?
- Remove your sunglasses and look.

1439
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:47,879
Are you going to take a selfie?

1440
01:18:48,519 --> 01:18:50,080
We're going to take the slipper.

1441
01:18:51,040 --> 01:18:53,200
Brother, that's my slipper!

1442
01:18:54,719 --> 01:18:57,759
Brother, look over there.
That's my slipper!

1443
01:18:57,839 --> 01:18:59,400
It's there.

1444
01:18:59,439 --> 01:19:01,919
Be quiet, man.
We can't be heard.

1445
01:19:01,960 --> 01:19:05,120
You drunken fool.
There is so much space outside your house.

1446
01:19:05,240 --> 01:19:08,439
Instead of leaving the slipper here,
you got drunk and tied it up the tree?

1447
01:19:08,479 --> 01:19:10,839
- My slipper!
- How did the slipper get there?

1448
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:14,280
I didn't put it up there.
That's a long story.

1449
01:19:14,360 --> 01:19:17,160
- You're going into the flashback.
- Yes, huddle up.

1450
01:19:18,519 --> 01:19:19,759
Dear!

1451
01:19:20,679 --> 01:19:23,159
- Devi, take a look at these.
- Brother!

1452
01:19:25,200 --> 01:19:28,000
- Brother, this is great.
- You like it?

1453
01:19:28,040 --> 01:19:30,519
- It's your favourite pink colour.
- Thank you, brother.

1454
01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:34,679
- Try it on!
- It's been used by someone.

1455
01:19:34,719 --> 01:19:36,799
How could that be?
The shopkeeper said it was new.

1456
01:19:36,839 --> 01:19:39,039
Swear to me!
Is this new?

1457
01:19:39,120 --> 01:19:42,160
No one would sell me
a single slipper.

1458
01:19:42,240 --> 01:19:43,120
So...

1459
01:19:43,160 --> 01:19:44,439
It's old but it looks new!

1460
01:19:44,479 --> 01:19:47,360
It's so expensive, you know.
No one in our area has a slipper like this.

1461
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:48,799
See for yourself.

1462
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:52,759
What's that noise?
Why are the birds getting restless?

1463
01:19:52,799 --> 01:19:54,759
If you didn't like it,
you could have thrown it in my face.

1464
01:19:54,799 --> 01:19:55,919
Why did you throw it there?

1465
01:19:55,960 --> 01:19:57,960
Now the old lady has started whining too!

1466
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:02,280
Why are you just watching?
Come here me, brother.

1467
01:20:02,679 --> 01:20:03,479
Poor guy...

1468
01:20:03,519 --> 01:20:05,719
Yes, you three should go help him.
Go there, fatso.

1469
01:20:06,040 --> 01:20:07,519
Why, won't you help him?

1470
01:20:07,559 --> 01:20:09,719
It's his slipper.
Let him take it on his own.

1471
01:20:09,759 --> 01:20:12,199
How will he do it with his broken arm?
You should fetch it!

1472
01:20:12,240 --> 01:20:14,599
- Not so loud, brother!
- Why?

1473
01:20:14,639 --> 01:20:16,919
- There is big controversy behind this.
- What?

1474
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:20,080
Three generations back,
when this tree was just a sapling...

1475
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:22,160
You fool!
Another flashback?

1476
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:22,920
Yes

1477
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:25,280
My legs are still hurting
from your previous flashback!

1478
01:20:25,360 --> 01:20:26,759
Another flashback already?

1479
01:20:26,799 --> 01:20:28,039
Just go fetch it!

1480
01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:30,880
- You've made me climb this thing!
- What's this?

1481
01:20:30,920 --> 01:20:32,680
Stop dawdling!
Hurry up, man.

1482
01:20:32,719 --> 01:20:33,320
What?

1483
01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:36,200
- Hold onto this. Make it quick.
- Dude, don't scream! I'm coming.

1484
01:20:36,280 --> 01:20:37,920
- Hurry up!
- Let go.

1485
01:20:37,960 --> 01:20:39,400
Bro, I'll go up.

1486
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:41,360
So that you can
pluck and eat the fruits?

1487
01:20:41,400 --> 01:20:43,240
Don't you have a ladder at home?

1488
01:20:43,280 --> 01:20:44,920
Stop screaming.
Shut your mouth.

1489
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:47,400
Mr. Don! He's just talking
instead of getting that slipper.

1490
01:20:47,439 --> 01:20:49,320
If you don't get it,
I'll hurl my slipper at you.

1491
01:20:49,360 --> 01:20:50,400
Brother, I'll get it.

1492
01:20:50,479 --> 01:20:51,280
It's just a slipper.

1493
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:53,599
Don't get excited like it's a
lottery or something. Hold on!

1494
01:20:53,639 --> 01:20:55,360
- Go for it.
- Yeah, climb up.

1495
01:20:57,519 --> 01:20:59,559
If I fall from here,
I'll shatter to pieces!

1496
01:20:59,599 --> 01:21:00,719
You're crawling?

1497
01:21:00,799 --> 01:21:02,479
Even without an arm,
he really went for it!

1498
01:21:02,519 --> 01:21:03,479
Hold on, brother.

1499
01:21:03,519 --> 01:21:04,679
Get it for me!

1500
01:21:05,080 --> 01:21:07,080
- I'm breaking twigs.
- What?

1501
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:08,439
You were at the bar earlier,...

1502
01:21:08,479 --> 01:21:10,599
...and now you're breaking
twigs to clean your teeth?

1503
01:21:10,679 --> 01:21:11,799
Drop it!

1504
01:21:12,280 --> 01:21:14,080
- That was hilarious!
- Want me to come up?

1505
01:21:14,120 --> 01:21:15,720
Who is that?

1506
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:17,800
Get down,
or I'll beat you up.

1507
01:21:17,839 --> 01:21:20,159
I'll smack you with a broom,
cover you up in shit...

1508
01:21:20,200 --> 01:21:22,160
Granny, my slipper is stuck in the tree...

1509
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:24,200
Mahesh has climbed up to get it for me.

1510
01:21:24,280 --> 01:21:25,840
Who is that there,
another don?

1511
01:21:25,879 --> 01:21:27,039
Is it Mahesh?

1512
01:21:27,080 --> 01:21:30,000
She's wearing glasses just like me,
and looks like an old actress.

1513
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:33,439
Periyasaamy, Chinnasaamy,
come here all of you!

1514
01:21:33,479 --> 01:21:35,160
Let's decide to whom
this tree belongs to

1515
01:21:35,200 --> 01:21:37,479
Oh no! The old lady
has made the phone call.

1516
01:21:37,519 --> 01:21:40,040
- Come here immediately!
- My dear uncles...

1517
01:21:40,120 --> 01:21:41,599
where are you all getting drunk?

1518
01:21:41,639 --> 01:21:43,079
The old lady has sounded the horns.

1519
01:21:43,120 --> 01:21:44,599
War has begun.
Get here quick!

1520
01:21:44,639 --> 01:21:47,119
I ask you to get the slipper,
and you're talking on the phone?

1521
01:21:47,200 --> 01:21:48,599
You fat tractor!
Shut it.

1522
01:21:48,639 --> 01:21:50,839
You're speaking with disrespect?
Did you mean me, or them?

1523
01:21:50,879 --> 01:21:51,999
Brother, he meant you.

1524
01:21:52,080 --> 01:21:53,920
If I climb up there...

1525
01:21:53,960 --> 01:21:56,160
Come up if you can, fatsos!

1526
01:21:56,200 --> 01:21:57,080
Call yourself a don?

1527
01:21:57,120 --> 01:21:59,080
You've come with this lowly guy
for a bloody slipper issue.

1528
01:21:59,160 --> 01:22:00,680
I can't hear anything!

1529
01:22:00,719 --> 01:22:02,039
Did he swear at me?

1530
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:03,479
- Yes?
- I didn't hear anything, bro.

1531
01:22:03,519 --> 01:22:05,639
You should rather consume poison
and kill yourselves!

1532
01:22:06,320 --> 01:22:07,679
Come on, you guys.

1533
01:22:07,719 --> 01:22:10,119
We should kill him today!

1534
01:22:10,160 --> 01:22:11,559
Oh no, they're here!

1535
01:22:11,599 --> 01:22:13,759
Don't let him get away.
Chop his legs off.

1536
01:22:13,799 --> 01:22:15,759
Mahesh, you've set foot on the tree!

1537
01:22:15,839 --> 01:22:19,079
- They look like they will kill me!
- Don't let him get away.

1538
01:22:19,160 --> 01:22:21,439
My son is here.
I dare you to come down.

1539
01:22:21,479 --> 01:22:23,959
Granny, ask someone to get my
slipper for me.

1540
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:27,000
They're going to kill me, and you're
still talking about your slipper?

1541
01:22:27,040 --> 01:22:28,880
You're getting rowdies from
outside town to threaten us?

1542
01:22:28,920 --> 01:22:29,720
Come down.

1543
01:22:29,759 --> 01:22:31,320
- Hey big man!
- What?

1544
01:22:31,360 --> 01:22:34,759
You said outside town, that's fair.
You called us rowdies, and that's true.

1545
01:22:34,799 --> 01:22:37,439
But he didn't get us here.
We got him here.

1546
01:22:37,519 --> 01:22:40,240
- The slipper is ours, the tree is yours.
- No, it's my granny's.

1547
01:22:40,280 --> 01:22:42,439
We'll be on our way
if we get our slipper back.

1548
01:22:42,519 --> 01:22:45,320
Mahesh! I won't rest
till I kill you.

1549
01:22:48,719 --> 01:22:50,799
Good catch!
That too with one hand.

1550
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:53,200
Wait up,
we're coming for you!

1551
01:22:54,479 --> 01:22:55,839
Mr. Don!

1552
01:22:55,879 --> 01:22:57,479
My slipper.

1553
01:22:57,599 --> 01:22:58,719
Come down!

1554
01:22:59,679 --> 01:23:02,320
I got my slipper back!
Let's leave.

1555
01:23:02,360 --> 01:23:04,040
But I feel sorry for him.

1556
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:05,439
They're going to end up
killing each other.

1557
01:23:05,479 --> 01:23:07,160
If we stay here, we'd become witnesses.

1558
01:23:07,240 --> 01:23:07,960
You think so?

1559
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:09,800
- Okay, then.
- Thank you very much, brother!

1560
01:23:09,879 --> 01:23:12,119
- I got my slipper back!
- I'm cursing you...

1561
01:23:12,160 --> 01:23:15,920
You're going to lose this slipper again,
and go mad looking for it.

1562
01:23:40,519 --> 01:23:42,200
Be patience. We will enquire

1563
01:23:42,240 --> 01:23:43,559
Did you hear the news?

1564
01:23:43,599 --> 01:23:45,200
The terrorists have declared that...

1565
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:47,240
your son-in-law
Mohanraj is going to be...

1566
01:23:47,280 --> 01:23:49,040
executed with the others
at 11 am tomorrow.

1567
01:23:49,080 --> 01:23:50,720
- You mean for real?
- Yes...

1568
01:23:50,759 --> 01:23:52,759
It's true.
I just saw the news.

1569
01:23:52,799 --> 01:23:55,199
The terrorists have released
an ultimatum saying...

1570
01:23:55,240 --> 01:23:58,080
...if their demands are not met
by the Syrian Government...

1571
01:23:58,120 --> 01:24:00,479
they will execute the
nine prisoners,...

1572
01:24:00,519 --> 01:24:02,919
including Tamil Engineer Mohanraj,
by 11 am tomorrow.

1573
01:24:03,040 --> 01:24:05,439
- Tomorrow--
- Don't say a thing!

1574
01:24:06,479 --> 01:24:08,599
I don't care what the others say.

1575
01:24:08,639 --> 01:24:11,719
But I believe that my
dad will definitely return.

1576
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:16,960
Abhi, you tell me...

1577
01:24:17,040 --> 01:24:18,720
My dad is a good man, right?

1578
01:24:18,759 --> 01:24:20,320
He is, without a doubt!

1579
01:24:21,759 --> 01:24:23,079
Don't cry.

1580
01:24:32,639 --> 01:24:34,999
I know, my dad will return.

1581
01:24:38,160 --> 01:24:39,599
He will come back.

1582
01:24:42,639 --> 01:24:44,479
Why has he left this here?

1583
01:24:47,759 --> 01:24:50,919
Why is it so dirty?
Maybe he picked up a fight with someone?

1584
01:24:54,879 --> 01:24:56,439
- What is it, boy?
- Nothing, mom.

1585
01:24:56,479 --> 01:24:58,599
Nothing?
What did you hide in there?

1586
01:24:58,639 --> 01:25:01,039
- It's nothing, mom.
- Then why do you look so guilty?

1587
01:25:01,080 --> 01:25:02,800
- It's nothing, mom.
- Take your hand away.

1588
01:25:02,839 --> 01:25:04,959
- Mom, it's nothing really.
- I said, take your hand away!

1589
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,080
- What's this?
- I'm sorry, mom.

1590
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:08,160
What's all this?

1591
01:25:08,240 --> 01:25:10,559
Is it just this,
or do you have other habits, too?

1592
01:25:10,599 --> 01:25:11,999
Nothing else, mom.

1593
01:25:12,160 --> 01:25:13,920
What's this, boy?

1594
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:15,920
- A slipper.
- Whose slipper is this?

1595
01:25:15,960 --> 01:25:17,200
How did this slipper end
up inside our house?

1596
01:25:17,280 --> 01:25:18,679
I don't know, mom.

1597
01:25:18,719 --> 01:25:20,039
A slipper inside a house
where God resides?

1598
01:25:20,120 --> 01:25:22,120
Whose slipper is this?

1599
01:25:22,479 --> 01:25:24,559
- I don't know, mom.
- See what your brother did!

1600
01:25:24,599 --> 01:25:25,999
Mom! What's this?

1601
01:25:26,040 --> 01:25:29,280
If he brings a slipper inside our house,
how will God reside here?

1602
01:25:29,360 --> 01:25:31,400
I've been unwell and unable to
predict the future for a while now.

1603
01:25:31,439 --> 01:25:32,639
I just understand why!

1604
01:25:32,679 --> 01:25:33,719
Someone must have given
this cursed slipper!

1605
01:25:33,799 --> 01:25:34,799
Mom, the cigarettes were mine...

1606
01:25:34,839 --> 01:25:36,879
Beat me for it, that's okay!
But I didn't bring the slipper.

1607
01:25:36,920 --> 01:25:37,920
Shut your mouth.

1608
01:25:37,960 --> 01:25:40,200
Why are you holding that filthy thing
in your hands?

1609
01:25:40,280 --> 01:25:43,719
First, rip it into eight pieces
and throw it in eight different directions.

1610
01:25:43,759 --> 01:25:45,639
We'll get the priest
to do a ritual tomorrow.

1611
01:25:45,679 --> 01:25:46,559
Sure thing.

1612
01:25:46,599 --> 01:25:48,959
- I didn't put the slipper there!
- Forget the slipper...

1613
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,439
You're telling mom you smoke cigarettes?
Think you're all grown up now?

1614
01:25:51,479 --> 01:25:55,400
I raised him with so much affection
and he's turned out to be a spoiled child.

1615
01:25:55,439 --> 01:25:57,879
- You dare tell me you smoke cigarettes?
- I won't, mom...

1616
01:25:57,920 --> 01:26:00,160
Have I ever made you feel
the absence of your dad?

1617
01:26:00,200 --> 01:26:03,360
I beat the drums and shout my lungs out
for you guys!

1618
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:05,479
Go away!

1619
01:26:10,439 --> 01:26:13,120
They say people roam like dogs
in the name of love.

1620
01:26:13,160 --> 01:26:15,400
You've roamed like a ghost,
and found her pair of slippers!

1621
01:26:15,439 --> 01:26:17,040
How did you do it?

1622
01:26:17,400 --> 01:26:20,839
When you return this to her,
you should convey your love.

1623
01:26:20,879 --> 01:26:21,839
Got it?

1624
01:26:21,879 --> 01:26:23,279
- Convey my love?
- Then what?

1625
01:26:23,320 --> 01:26:25,559
Bhai, how will I convey my love
when she is this sad?

1626
01:26:25,599 --> 01:26:27,240
- When are you going to say it?
- Love isn't important...

1627
01:26:27,280 --> 01:26:27,800
Then?

1628
01:26:27,839 --> 01:26:30,839
When she sees these slippers, the belief
she gets that her dad will be okay...

1629
01:26:30,879 --> 01:26:32,679
I'm struggling only for that.

1630
01:26:33,280 --> 01:26:34,439
Yeah, right!

1631
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:41,679
Work is done.
Get going.

1632
01:26:41,719 --> 01:26:44,400
Get going? Wait, I still have
an important thing to do.

1633
01:26:44,439 --> 01:26:45,879
Where are you going?

1634
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:47,560
Wait for a moment, Bhai.

1635
01:26:47,599 --> 01:26:49,160
How can I just take them back like this?

1636
01:26:49,200 --> 01:26:49,960
So?

1637
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,080
- We need to show some respect.
- Respect?

1638
01:26:55,599 --> 01:26:57,200
- Bhai, do you need this?
- Of course.

1639
01:26:57,240 --> 01:26:59,960
- It's someone else's slippers.
- Let me take it. Please, Bhai!

1640
01:27:02,839 --> 01:27:04,039
Bhai, how does it look?

1641
01:27:04,080 --> 01:27:05,800
- It looks scary.
- Why, Bhai?

1642
01:27:05,839 --> 01:27:08,759
Whenever someone sends a parcel,
they say 'we' are behind it.

1643
01:27:08,799 --> 01:27:11,959
- You're taking this parcel from my shop.
- No such thing will happen, Bhai.

1644
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,600
Bhai, these slippers are going to
leave me today.

1645
01:27:14,639 --> 01:27:16,400
Let's take one last selfie with this?

1646
01:27:16,479 --> 01:27:18,040
- A selfie with slippers?
- Yes, Bhai!

1647
01:27:18,080 --> 01:27:20,360
- Bhai, hold this.
- Now I need to do this, too?

1648
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:21,599
I don't know what he is up to!

1649
01:27:21,639 --> 01:27:23,679
It's going to appear in bold
letters on the newspapers!

1650
01:27:23,719 --> 01:27:24,679
What's this?

1651
01:27:24,759 --> 01:27:27,799
- Bhai, moments like these are important...
- Yeah, sure!

1652
01:27:27,839 --> 01:27:30,799
- Why are you hiding behind it?
- So that my face doesn't show.

1653
01:27:30,879 --> 01:27:32,439
- It will all be okay.
- Yeah, right!

1654
01:27:32,479 --> 01:27:34,719
Bhai! Moments like these
are important in life.

1655
01:27:34,759 --> 01:27:35,280
Yes

1656
01:27:35,320 --> 01:27:36,920
- We need to record it.
- Of course.

1657
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:38,240
Smile, Bhai!

1658
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:51,240
Oh no. What's this?

1659
01:28:51,280 --> 01:28:52,719
Sandhya!

1660
01:28:52,799 --> 01:28:54,879
Boy! Dad!
Everyone get here.

1661
01:28:54,920 --> 01:28:56,360
There is a parcel here.

1662
01:28:56,400 --> 01:28:58,240
They've kidnapped him,
and sent a bomb home.

1663
01:28:58,280 --> 01:29:00,519
- Boy! Wake up.
- What is it, sister?

1664
01:29:00,559 --> 01:29:02,160
- They've sent us a bomb.
- A balm?

1665
01:29:02,200 --> 01:29:03,559
No! It's a bomb.

1666
01:29:03,599 --> 01:29:06,280
- Call the cops or the fire service.
- What's wrong, mom?

1667
01:29:06,320 --> 01:29:08,679
- What's wrong, mom?
- Look, it's a bomb.

1668
01:29:08,719 --> 01:29:10,959
I'm saying it's a bomb and
you're going after it?

1669
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:12,200
What are you blabbering, mom?

1670
01:29:12,240 --> 01:29:14,840
They kidnapped your father there,
and they've sent home a bomb.

1671
01:29:14,879 --> 01:29:16,159
A parcel? A bomb?

1672
01:29:16,200 --> 01:29:17,679
YES!

1673
01:29:20,519 --> 01:29:22,080
Move!
Left, right...

1674
01:29:22,160 --> 01:29:23,639
Left, right, left...

1675
01:29:23,679 --> 01:29:25,759
- Where are you going?
- I've lived my life.

1676
01:29:25,799 --> 01:29:28,799
Whatever happens, let it stop with me.
You guys be safe.

1677
01:29:34,799 --> 01:29:37,679
Let's all shut our ears.
We don't know when the bomb would go off.

1678
01:29:39,040 --> 01:29:41,479
You're closing your ears,
and standing with us women?

1679
01:29:41,559 --> 01:29:44,280
An old man has gone out on his own,
go check on him! Go out.

1680
01:29:44,320 --> 01:29:45,479
Grandpa

1681
01:29:48,200 --> 01:29:49,800
Open the door, grandpa.

1682
01:29:50,479 --> 01:29:52,679
Even firecrackers go stale
when dropped in water.

1683
01:29:52,759 --> 01:29:54,400
How would a bomb work?

1684
01:29:54,479 --> 01:29:56,439
- Grandpa...
- The door isn't locked!

1685
01:29:56,599 --> 01:29:58,479
The door was only closed!

1686
01:29:58,519 --> 01:29:59,999
Idiot! Go check on him.

1687
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:03,160
Grandpa. What happened to the bomb?

1688
01:30:06,639 --> 01:30:08,360
- A slipper?
- Shh!

1689
01:30:09,280 --> 01:30:11,240
Dad, what happened to the bomb?

1690
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:12,920
I've got the gift.

1691
01:30:34,320 --> 01:30:35,280
Hello?

1692
01:30:35,400 --> 01:30:36,559
Little one...

1693
01:30:38,599 --> 01:30:39,879
Dad!

1694
01:30:39,920 --> 01:30:41,760
- Little one...
- Dad...

1695
01:30:42,200 --> 01:30:43,559
Dad!

1696
01:30:46,719 --> 01:30:47,799
Dad!

1697
01:30:47,879 --> 01:30:48,879
Yes...

1698
01:30:49,799 --> 01:30:51,360
It's dad speaking.

1699
01:30:51,879 --> 01:30:53,679
Mom, it's dad on the phone.

1700
01:30:54,479 --> 01:30:57,160
- Dad, how are you?
- I'm fine...

1701
01:30:57,479 --> 01:30:58,839
I'm doing good.

1702
01:30:59,360 --> 01:31:00,799
What happened, dad?

1703
01:31:00,839 --> 01:31:03,159
- What happened?
- They let me go.

1704
01:31:03,799 --> 01:31:05,519
I walked a long distance...

1705
01:31:05,559 --> 01:31:07,559
I feel weak without food or water.

1706
01:31:07,799 --> 01:31:09,999
But I'm good.
I'm doing good.

1707
01:31:10,479 --> 01:31:13,040
Come back home soon.
Never leave me here after.

1708
01:31:13,080 --> 01:31:14,320
I'm not going anywhere.

1709
01:31:14,360 --> 01:31:15,759
I'm going to stay with you.

1710
01:31:15,879 --> 01:31:18,159
- Dad!
- Is mom doing well?

1711
01:31:38,439 --> 01:31:40,280
Looks like they released
your father-in-law!

1712
01:31:40,320 --> 01:31:42,120
Yes, Bhai.
I'm so happy.

1713
01:31:42,160 --> 01:31:44,120
You said your mom makes false prophecies.

1714
01:31:44,160 --> 01:31:45,800
And now it happened for real.

1715
01:31:45,839 --> 01:31:47,679
I believe my mother now only!

1716
01:31:48,120 --> 01:31:50,680
All these days I thought
she does this for money.

1717
01:31:50,719 --> 01:31:52,999
She's been eating only once a day
for the last nineteen years.

1718
01:31:53,040 --> 01:31:56,240
Allah or Ambal... God exists to those
who believe in him.

1719
01:31:56,280 --> 01:31:59,400
I don't know if it happened because of her,
or because of prayers...

1720
01:31:59,439 --> 01:32:01,439
But it happened exactly as she predicted.

1721
01:32:01,479 --> 01:32:04,120
My mom is truly great, Bhai.
I'm extremely happy.

1722
01:32:04,160 --> 01:32:06,880
In the midst of this happiness,
you should propose your love today.

1723
01:32:06,920 --> 01:32:08,760
Bhai, what are you saying?

1724
01:32:08,799 --> 01:32:11,759
She must be so happy today.
How could I propose my love?

1725
01:32:11,839 --> 01:32:14,599
Yesterday you said you can't,
because she's sad.

1726
01:32:14,639 --> 01:32:16,999
Today she's happy,
and that's a problem too?

1727
01:32:17,360 --> 01:32:20,880
You should not propose during
such happiness, or such sadness.

1728
01:32:20,920 --> 01:32:22,080
It's a feeling, Bhai.

1729
01:32:22,120 --> 01:32:26,040
Guys like you are stale firecrackers.
Only fit for 'feeling'!

1730
01:32:26,080 --> 01:32:29,320
You wait and watch, someone else
is going to set off the fireworks!

1731
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:35,920
Start!

1732
01:32:35,960 --> 01:32:38,920
Long Live Remo Ravi!
Long Live Remo Ravi!

1733
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,120
Kids are in full form.

1734
01:32:41,160 --> 01:32:42,320
Keep that up, boys!

1735
01:32:42,360 --> 01:32:43,679
- What?
- A sweet?

1736
01:32:43,719 --> 01:32:45,759
- Say 'Long Live Remo Ravi'
- Long Live Remo Ravi!

1737
01:32:45,839 --> 01:32:47,360
- Say it louder.
- Long Live Remo Ravi.

1738
01:32:47,400 --> 01:32:48,519
Keep saying it...

1739
01:32:49,200 --> 01:32:51,479
I've completed three streets,
this is the fourth one...

1740
01:32:51,519 --> 01:32:52,240
Who is she?

1741
01:32:52,320 --> 01:32:53,559
- Excuse me, lady.
- Yes?

1742
01:32:53,599 --> 01:32:54,759
- Here's a sweet.
- What for?

1743
01:32:54,799 --> 01:32:56,439
Because you walked!

1744
01:32:56,839 --> 01:32:59,599
- Say 'Long Live Remo Ravi'.
- Long Live Remo Ravi.

1745
01:32:59,639 --> 01:33:00,439
- Come here.
- What?

1746
01:33:00,519 --> 01:33:02,080
What's with that tone?
Say it louder.

1747
01:33:02,120 --> 01:33:03,439
That's all I can do for one sweet.

1748
01:33:03,479 --> 01:33:04,719
Here, now say it.

1749
01:33:04,759 --> 01:33:06,839
Long Live Remo Ravi.

1750
01:33:06,879 --> 01:33:09,039
Continue shouting that
when you cross Sandhya's house.

1751
01:33:09,080 --> 01:33:11,000
I'll give you two sweets.

1752
01:33:15,799 --> 01:33:17,879
Why are you talking to the slipper?

1753
01:33:17,920 --> 01:33:21,880
They say when a slipper is lost at home,
a dog must have taken it.

1754
01:33:21,920 --> 01:33:24,680
But when you lose these
two at different places,

1755
01:33:24,719 --> 01:33:26,360
...and get them back
delivered home together

1756
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:28,599
It must be the work of
someone who follows you.

1757
01:33:28,639 --> 01:33:31,759
Lot of boys following you.
Who among them did this?

1758
01:33:32,080 --> 01:33:33,200
I don't know.

1759
01:33:33,240 --> 01:33:35,240
What do you mean?

1760
01:33:35,519 --> 01:33:36,959
I really don't know.

1761
01:33:39,879 --> 01:33:42,079
Sandhya, you've left the 'heart' behind.

1762
01:33:49,599 --> 01:33:54,439
No matter how hard you think,
you won't be able to find out who it was.

1763
01:33:54,559 --> 01:33:56,479
- Shall I tell you?
- Who?

1764
01:33:56,519 --> 01:33:58,280
- Remo Ravi.
- Yuck!

1765
01:33:58,320 --> 01:34:02,120
So many pretty couples get married,
and then get divorced too, right?

1766
01:34:02,160 --> 01:34:03,200
Don't look at appearances.

1767
01:34:03,240 --> 01:34:05,960
Look at his heart.
I'm sure he is a good guy at heart.

1768
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:07,439
Sandhya, eat this sweet.

1769
01:34:07,479 --> 01:34:09,160
- What for?
- For your dad's release.

1770
01:34:09,200 --> 01:34:11,160
- A guy is distributing sweets.
- Who?

1771
01:34:11,200 --> 01:34:12,639
That Remo Ravi.

1772
01:34:13,799 --> 01:34:15,199
Awesome!

1773
01:34:15,280 --> 01:34:18,120
Didn't I tell you? He is even
buying sweets for everyone.

1774
01:34:18,160 --> 01:34:20,120
Sandhya, aren't you eating?

1775
01:34:23,400 --> 01:34:25,679
So, you're not going to believe me?

1776
01:34:26,280 --> 01:34:29,200
Then let's do this.
Wear these slippers, and let's go out.

1777
01:34:29,280 --> 01:34:32,519
The guy who looks at your slippers instead
of looking at your face...

1778
01:34:32,559 --> 01:34:33,879
he is the guy.

1779
01:34:33,920 --> 01:34:35,960
So, how is my idea?

1780
01:34:47,759 --> 01:34:58,400
"My dearest, Oh my dearest!
You have tricked me, you've changed me."

1781
01:34:58,519 --> 01:35:08,559
"I falter and lost my way;
Really, you changed my colours."

1782
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:20,320
"I don't know who you are, where you are;
But I've fallen for you"

1783
01:35:20,400 --> 01:35:29,839
"I falter, I have lost my way;
My dearest, I have!"

1784
01:36:28,479 --> 01:36:33,639
"Sandhya, are you happy now?
I see the world upside down."

1785
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:39,360
"Are you wearing those slippers?
I hope you wish to see me"

1786
01:36:39,639 --> 01:36:45,119
"How I keep ruffling my hair;
How I raise my shirt's collar."

1787
01:36:45,160 --> 01:36:50,280
"I ruffle my hair and raise my collar;
Never seen me like this before!"

1788
01:36:50,320 --> 01:36:53,320
"Oh, you are my girl!"

1789
01:37:19,879 --> 01:37:30,199
"My sympathetic, Oh my sympathetic!
What an affectionate man you are."

1790
01:37:30,719 --> 01:37:41,959
"Beautifully, you broke into my heart;
Masterfully, you slipped into it."

1791
01:37:42,240 --> 01:37:52,479
"I wore this love, not my slippers;
Eagerly waiting to meet you."

1792
01:37:52,559 --> 01:38:04,080
"My dearest! My symapthetic!
What an affectionate man you are."

1793
01:38:19,839 --> 01:38:25,279
"Let's meet, Sandhya. Come to me, quick.
There's no one between us."

1794
01:38:25,360 --> 01:38:28,040
"It's falling in place,
I'm getting what I yearned;"

1795
01:38:28,080 --> 01:38:30,720
"Fate is bringing us together."

1796
01:38:30,799 --> 01:38:36,239
"I keep grinning ear to ear;
I take selfies every chance I get."

1797
01:38:36,320 --> 01:38:41,679
"I'm grinning, clicking selfies;
You'll will find out soon..Who I am.

1798
01:38:41,759 --> 01:38:44,999
"Girl, I am your guy."

1799
01:39:09,839 --> 01:39:11,119
Stop, guys!

1800
01:39:11,200 --> 01:39:13,559
Give me back my phone.
It's my life!

1801
01:39:13,599 --> 01:39:15,200
Stop, you guys.

1802
01:39:15,280 --> 01:39:16,800
Brother, catch those guys...

1803
01:39:16,839 --> 01:39:18,679
- they snatched my phone.
- I can't do that.

1804
01:39:18,719 --> 01:39:20,439
Who are you guys?
Stop!

1805
01:39:22,080 --> 01:39:24,040
Sir, please go faster
and catch the thieves.

1806
01:39:24,080 --> 01:39:25,280
Please, sir.

1807
01:39:25,679 --> 01:39:27,759
Give me back my phone.

1808
01:39:33,120 --> 01:39:34,880
Greetings!
Manjakuppam Police.

1809
01:39:34,960 --> 01:39:37,280
Sir, two guys stole my phone.

1810
01:39:37,320 --> 01:39:39,880
You can't just report it like this.

1811
01:39:39,920 --> 01:39:41,240
When did you lose it?

1812
01:39:41,280 --> 01:39:43,559
How did you lose it?
What time did you...

1813
01:39:43,599 --> 01:39:45,360
- Just now, sir!
- You can't say it over phone.

1814
01:39:45,400 --> 01:39:47,759
Come to the police station in person,
and file a complaint.

1815
01:39:47,799 --> 01:39:50,320
Sir, I'll definitely do that.
But it's real urgent, please sir.

1816
01:39:50,360 --> 01:39:52,639
Please trace out which tower
my phone is connected to.

1817
01:39:52,679 --> 01:39:53,679
Do this...

1818
01:39:53,719 --> 01:39:56,439
Get the phone's purchase bill,
your ID proof...

1819
01:39:56,479 --> 01:39:58,160
Buy one bundle of A4 paper.

1820
01:39:58,240 --> 01:40:01,360
And 20 pens. Blue gel pens.
Buy that, too.

1821
01:40:01,439 --> 01:40:02,519
What is that for?

1822
01:40:02,559 --> 01:40:05,120
- It's for filing the complaint, son!
- Sir, it's real urgent.

1823
01:40:05,160 --> 01:40:06,720
Find my phone, somehow.

1824
01:40:06,759 --> 01:40:08,639
You're saying it's urgent
and needs to be traced.

1825
01:40:08,679 --> 01:40:09,559
It will cost you a bit.

1826
01:40:09,599 --> 01:40:11,559
I don't care how much it costs.
Please sir.

1827
01:40:11,599 --> 01:40:13,839
- Okay, come in person then.
- Sir! Hold on.

1828
01:40:14,160 --> 01:40:16,160
You asked for everything,
but didn't take down my phone number.

1829
01:40:16,200 --> 01:40:19,479
Wait, we just finished the cash dealing.
We're just getting to the case.

1830
01:40:19,799 --> 01:40:21,279
Now, tell me your number.

1831
01:40:21,320 --> 01:40:24,040
It's 9940255733.

1832
01:40:24,080 --> 01:40:26,640
The number looks fancy.
You must be some VIP!

1833
01:40:26,679 --> 01:40:28,759
- We will find it, don't worry.
- Thanks.

1834
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:09,280
Mr. Thief!

1835
01:41:09,679 --> 01:41:11,320
Thank you very much.

1836
01:41:13,639 --> 01:41:15,200
It's my life.

1837
01:41:15,240 --> 01:41:18,160
You've returned it back to me.
You shall live long and prosper!

1838
01:41:20,920 --> 01:41:22,080
Hello?

1839
01:41:22,519 --> 01:41:24,759
You thief! I've traced you.

1840
01:41:24,839 --> 01:41:27,519
You're in College Road now, right?
This phone belongs to a VIP.

1841
01:41:27,559 --> 01:41:29,280
Just surrender yourself
and return the phone.

1842
01:41:29,320 --> 01:41:30,960
Or, I'll finish you off in an encounter.

1843
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:34,000
- Superb, sir! Superb!
- You, accused!

1844
01:41:34,040 --> 01:41:35,880
You're lauding the police?

1845
01:41:36,040 --> 01:41:37,680
- I'll kill you.
- Sir, one minute.

1846
01:41:37,759 --> 01:41:39,999
I'm not the thief,
I'm the phone's owner.

1847
01:41:40,040 --> 01:41:42,120
- What are you saying?
- Yes, sir...

1848
01:41:42,160 --> 01:41:44,519
The thief had a change of heart,
and returned the phone to me.

1849
01:41:44,599 --> 01:41:47,320
The thieves in our city are superb,
and the police is superb, too!

1850
01:41:47,360 --> 01:41:49,679
You're applauding the thieves,
and the cops?

1851
01:41:49,759 --> 01:41:52,079
- Shall we close the case, then?
- Yes, sir.

1852
01:41:52,120 --> 01:41:54,439
The entire police force has worked for you.
Will you come here?

1853
01:41:54,519 --> 01:41:56,040
Sir, I'll be there.

1854
01:41:56,080 --> 01:42:00,439
Long Live Remo Ravi!
Long Live Remo Ravi!

1855
01:42:00,479 --> 01:42:02,360
What's happening here?

1856
01:42:02,920 --> 01:42:04,480
The poster is dancing on its own?

1857
01:42:04,559 --> 01:42:06,400
Someone is pulling the
strings from behind.

1858
01:42:06,439 --> 01:42:08,040
J- ackie!
- Long Live Remo Ravi.

1859
01:42:08,080 --> 01:42:09,160
Stop it.

1860
01:42:09,240 --> 01:42:12,559
Who are you? The entire colony
is singing your praises!

1861
01:42:12,599 --> 01:42:15,079
All the people like me.
What is it to you?

1862
01:42:15,120 --> 01:42:17,760
Maybe they all like you,
but why does MY wife like you?

1863
01:42:17,799 --> 01:42:19,599
You should ask your wife.
Why are you asking me?!

1864
01:42:19,639 --> 01:42:21,439
What do you have to do with this colony?

1865
01:42:21,479 --> 01:42:23,200
I have nothing to do with the colony...

1866
01:42:23,240 --> 01:42:25,559
But I have a lot to do with someone
who lives here.

1867
01:42:25,599 --> 01:42:26,839
Wait here for five minutes.

1868
01:42:26,879 --> 01:42:28,759
I'll fetch my
brother-in-law and sort you out.

1869
01:42:28,799 --> 01:42:30,559
You've only got three minutes.
Make it quick.

1870
01:42:30,599 --> 01:42:32,039
Jackie, you continue.

1871
01:42:32,120 --> 01:42:34,680
- Long Live Remo Ravi.
- Brother-in-law!

1872
01:42:34,719 --> 01:42:36,320
- Hello Brother-in-law!
- What's all this?

1873
01:42:36,360 --> 01:42:38,160
This guy says he is up to
something with your sister,...

1874
01:42:38,200 --> 01:42:39,880
and you're dancing
around with his poster?

1875
01:42:39,960 --> 01:42:41,720
- He gave me a sweet!
- So you'd go all sweet on him?

1876
01:42:41,759 --> 01:42:43,599
- Brother-in-law!
- Such a shameless family.

1877
01:42:43,759 --> 01:42:45,719
I shouldn't have married
into your family!

1878
01:42:45,759 --> 01:42:47,639
Brother-in-law...

1879
01:42:50,719 --> 01:42:52,119
Greetings!
Manjakuppam Police.

1880
01:42:52,200 --> 01:42:54,679
Sir, I'd called you about
the missing phone...

1881
01:42:54,719 --> 01:42:56,320
- 994027--
- Son...

1882
01:42:56,360 --> 01:42:58,320
You can't complain over phone.

1883
01:42:58,400 --> 01:42:59,839
You do this...

1884
01:42:59,879 --> 01:43:02,959
I'll get the bill, ID proof,
A4 papers, and 20 pens.

1885
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:03,960
How do you know this?

1886
01:43:04,040 --> 01:43:05,360
I filed a complaint
only this morning, sir!

1887
01:43:05,400 --> 01:43:06,400
- Oh, it's you!
- Sir...

1888
01:43:06,519 --> 01:43:08,639
The thief who returned
my phone back to me

1889
01:43:08,679 --> 01:43:10,559
He took my memory card, sir.

1890
01:43:13,240 --> 01:43:14,840
Please find it for me, sir.

1891
01:43:14,879 --> 01:43:16,400
But we closed your case files.

1892
01:43:16,439 --> 01:43:19,080
- Sir, please reopen it.
- But you got your phone back.

1893
01:43:19,160 --> 01:43:22,360
Sir, the memory card is more important
to me than the phone itself.

1894
01:43:22,400 --> 01:43:24,519
You're stressing so much
on the memory card.

1895
01:43:24,559 --> 01:43:26,200
Does it have some private
photos of that kind?

1896
01:43:26,240 --> 01:43:27,439
Sir, stop kidding.

1897
01:43:27,479 --> 01:43:28,919
Who is kidding?
Is it me, or you?

1898
01:43:28,960 --> 01:43:31,680
Sir, I'll give you all
the money you want

1899
01:43:31,719 --> 01:43:33,559
Rascal, you think police
are jobless people?

1900
01:43:33,599 --> 01:43:36,320
I don't need your money, or your case.
You'll never get your memory card back.

1901
01:43:36,360 --> 01:43:37,240
Hang up!

1902
01:43:37,280 --> 01:43:38,679
What are you thinking?

1903
01:43:38,719 --> 01:43:39,799
Nothing.

1904
01:43:43,639 --> 01:43:46,479
- Isn't that Remo Ravi's side-kick?
- Yes, it's him!

1905
01:43:46,519 --> 01:43:48,999
Why is this guy here,
instead of Remo?

1906
01:43:49,080 --> 01:43:51,519
This is the first time we're seeing
him after that beating, right?

1907
01:43:51,559 --> 01:43:53,959
- I never saw him even back then!
- Look at him.

1908
01:43:54,120 --> 01:43:56,000
His arm is rocking in a cradle.

1909
01:43:56,040 --> 01:43:59,200
I think some guy must
have thrashed him.

1910
01:44:07,040 --> 01:44:09,519
Why is he wearing that T-shirt?

1911
01:44:10,400 --> 01:44:14,120
- He is not even on my list.
- He won't be on anyone's list.

1912
01:44:15,960 --> 01:44:18,240
Why is he wearing this
particular T-shirt now?

1913
01:44:18,280 --> 01:44:19,559
Why don't you ask him?

1914
01:44:19,639 --> 01:44:23,919
Vote for slipper

1915
01:44:23,960 --> 01:44:27,680
Vote for slipper

1916
01:44:27,719 --> 01:44:31,959
Vote for slipper

1917
01:44:40,320 --> 01:44:42,880
Look there!
They're campaigning for votes.

1918
01:44:48,519 --> 01:44:52,040
This was the only job these guys didn't do.
Now you've brought them here, too?

1919
01:44:52,080 --> 01:44:53,720
What's wrong if I hire them?

1920
01:44:53,799 --> 01:44:57,159
If I hire men from our state,
they'll campaign for me today.

1921
01:44:57,200 --> 01:44:59,960
Tomorrow, they'll change clothes
and campaign for someone else.

1922
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:03,400
Not just that, they get drunk with my money
and pass out in the middle of the job.

1923
01:45:03,479 --> 01:45:06,200
But these paani-puri boys
just eat their paav-bhaji...

1924
01:45:06,240 --> 01:45:08,360
and slog all day long for me.

1925
01:45:08,400 --> 01:45:10,639
Why are you just standing here?
You've been paid 400 bucks...

1926
01:45:10,719 --> 01:45:12,759
and had a plateful of biriyani!
Do your duty.

1927
01:45:12,799 --> 01:45:14,759
Our Party Symbol - the Slipper.

1928
01:45:14,839 --> 01:45:17,039
He is campaigning for votes,
and you thought...

1929
01:45:17,080 --> 01:45:19,200
- I didn't say anything.
- Then why did you stop?

1930
01:45:19,280 --> 01:45:20,719
Let's go.

1931
01:45:23,599 --> 01:45:25,919
Our Party Symbol - the Slipper.

1932
01:45:29,679 --> 01:45:31,240
Hey, son!

1933
01:45:31,320 --> 01:45:32,639
One-handed boy.

1934
01:45:33,120 --> 01:45:35,200
Wow! I'm so happy.

1935
01:45:35,280 --> 01:45:38,080
You told me that day,
and now you've done exactly that.

1936
01:45:38,120 --> 01:45:40,599
You've done something
no politician managed to do.

1937
01:45:41,360 --> 01:45:43,240
Why are they going that way?
Boys!

1938
01:45:43,280 --> 01:45:46,599
The paani puri boys don't know the
language and the directions here.

1939
01:45:46,639 --> 01:45:48,079
Why don't you lead them for a bit?

1940
01:45:48,120 --> 01:45:49,439
- Go!
- What?

1941
01:45:49,599 --> 01:45:51,240
You're following me for security?

1942
01:45:51,280 --> 01:45:58,400
My dear brother holds the party symbol-
the slipper, close to his heart with love.

1943
01:45:59,400 --> 01:46:01,519
- Go, man!
- Watch the tone.

1944
01:46:01,559 --> 01:46:02,959
All that help I did,
for your love!

1945
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:04,400
You've ruined everything.

1946
01:46:04,439 --> 01:46:05,919
Couldn't you find another street?

1947
01:46:05,960 --> 01:46:09,200
- You won't even recover your deposit!
- I've never recovered that, ever!

1948
01:46:10,879 --> 01:46:12,599
- Just leave, man.
- Oh no.

1949
01:46:12,639 --> 01:46:14,559
Just leave, or I'll kill you.

1950
01:46:14,599 --> 01:46:16,559
Let's leave, quick.

1951
01:46:17,280 --> 01:46:18,519
Let's get going!

1952
01:46:18,559 --> 01:46:20,280
Your love won't succeed!

1953
01:46:36,080 --> 01:46:37,559
Look there!

1954
01:46:39,120 --> 01:46:41,479
Why should he put up banners
for your dad's release?

1955
01:46:41,519 --> 01:46:44,080
- Why are you asking me?
- Okay, I'll tell you the answer.

1956
01:46:44,400 --> 01:46:46,759
Why should he distribute
sweets to everyone,...

1957
01:46:46,799 --> 01:46:48,759
burst crackers,
and go on a fast?

1958
01:46:48,799 --> 01:46:52,679
Above all that, why should he find the
lost slippers and give it back to you?

1959
01:46:52,879 --> 01:46:55,559
How can someone prove his
love more obviously?

1960
01:47:01,240 --> 01:47:03,920
I need to talk to him.
Ask him to come immediately.

1961
01:47:06,519 --> 01:47:09,200
Very good!
Your arm has healed well.

1962
01:47:09,400 --> 01:47:11,879
But it still hurts a bit.

1963
01:47:13,280 --> 01:47:14,280
It's nothing.

1964
01:47:14,400 --> 01:47:18,040
Your hand was like this all month right,
so it's just a mental thing.

1965
01:47:18,160 --> 01:47:22,439
If you move your hand up
and down like this daily,...

1966
01:47:22,479 --> 01:47:23,280
it will be alright.

1967
01:47:23,320 --> 01:47:25,479
But one condition.
Don't lift heavy weights.

1968
01:47:25,559 --> 01:47:29,039
At max, you can lift one glass of water.
Okay?

1969
01:47:29,120 --> 01:47:31,840
(Liquor consumption/smoking
is injurious to health)

1970
01:47:47,360 --> 01:47:48,320
Hello?

1971
01:47:48,360 --> 01:47:50,479
- Junior, where are you?
- Tell me.

1972
01:47:50,519 --> 01:47:52,719
Come quickly,
it's something important.

1973
01:47:53,040 --> 01:47:54,040
No need.

1974
01:47:54,559 --> 01:47:56,799
I'm still in tears because
of what happened last time.

1975
01:47:56,879 --> 01:47:58,439
I get it, boy.

1976
01:47:58,479 --> 01:48:02,679
The same Sandhya who slippered me that day,
called me up and wants to meet me now.

1977
01:48:02,719 --> 01:48:04,240
Why does she want to meet you?

1978
01:48:04,280 --> 01:48:06,200
My love has worked out.

1979
01:48:06,559 --> 01:48:08,240
How does she love you?

1980
01:48:08,280 --> 01:48:10,200
Why, can't someone
fall in love with me?

1981
01:48:10,240 --> 01:48:12,360
She loves me so deeply!
Come quick.

1982
01:48:13,599 --> 01:48:15,200
Why do you need me anymore?

1983
01:48:15,240 --> 01:48:16,920
She always brings a
side-kick with her, right?

1984
01:48:16,960 --> 01:48:18,439
I need one, too.

1985
01:48:18,479 --> 01:48:19,879
Get here quick.

1986
01:48:20,439 --> 01:48:22,919
- You've gone there?
- Waiting for a bouquet.

1987
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:26,280
- Where's the spot?
- The same place where you got slippered!

1988
01:48:26,320 --> 01:48:27,320
Quick, boy.

1989
01:48:34,320 --> 01:48:42,200
I'm a student awaiting results
in an exam called love.

1990
01:48:45,320 --> 01:48:47,679
Dolly, Dolly, Dolly,  Dolly.

1991
01:48:49,040 --> 01:48:51,280
Dolly, Dolly, Dolly,  Dolly.

1992
01:48:53,839 --> 01:48:55,599
Hey, junior! Come on.

1993
01:48:56,839 --> 01:48:59,479
So, junior...
Remo Ravi is real happy.

1994
01:48:59,519 --> 01:49:01,160
I told you the other day.

1995
01:49:01,200 --> 01:49:04,559
That she'll eventually fall in
love with me, and marry me.

1996
01:49:04,599 --> 01:49:06,400
You didn't believe me.
Now it's happening!

1997
01:49:06,439 --> 01:49:07,479
She really said this?

1998
01:49:07,519 --> 01:49:10,240
The thing with Shanthi was
just me being a flirt.

1999
01:49:10,360 --> 01:49:12,200
But with Sandhya, that was a real effort.

2000
01:49:12,240 --> 01:49:14,479
- What effort did you put in?
- I erected a canopy for 10 grand.

2001
01:49:14,519 --> 01:49:15,559
I filled petrol in my vehicle.

2002
01:49:15,639 --> 01:49:16,879
I got drunk when I was tired.

2003
01:49:16,920 --> 01:49:19,440
I put up banners and posters.
I burst fire crackers.

2004
01:49:19,479 --> 01:49:21,000
I went around distributing sweets.

2005
01:49:21,040 --> 01:49:22,800
On my way here,
I got a bouquet for 300 bucks.

2006
01:49:22,839 --> 01:49:24,479
I've spent 60,300 rupees in total!

2007
01:49:24,519 --> 01:49:25,959
What more effort can I put in?

2008
01:49:26,040 --> 01:49:28,880
- She's worth just 60,300 rupees then?
- I don't care!

2009
01:49:28,920 --> 01:49:31,200
- You know what an effort means?
- I just told you!

2010
01:49:31,240 --> 01:49:33,880
You know what an effort means?
Let me tell you.

2011
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:37,920
Jumping out of a moving bus without any
care for the sake of someone you like...

2012
01:49:37,960 --> 01:49:39,480
that's effort.

2013
01:49:39,519 --> 01:49:43,959
When she searches for her lost thing,
our heart will too feel the pain...

2014
01:49:44,040 --> 01:49:47,160
wanting it all to end,
that's effort!

2015
01:49:47,200 --> 01:49:50,000
Waking up early and searching
the newspapers to see...

2016
01:49:50,040 --> 01:49:52,800
if there is any news that
would make her happy...

2017
01:49:52,839 --> 01:49:54,519
that's called effort.

2018
01:49:55,599 --> 01:49:58,280
You only hurt your arm.
Not your head, right?

2019
01:49:58,320 --> 01:50:01,479
- You've gone mental?
- Yes, I've gone mental.

2020
01:50:01,519 --> 01:50:05,400
Wandering all night without food,
offering beverages to unknowns...

2021
01:50:05,479 --> 01:50:09,120
falling on my knees and begging people,
yes, I have gone mental!

2022
01:50:09,240 --> 01:50:11,320
I roamed like a dog and
quarreled with people...

2023
01:50:11,360 --> 01:50:12,759
to bring back the lost thing
safely to the beloved

2024
01:50:12,799 --> 01:50:15,239
and when I finally found
what she was looking for,...

2025
01:50:15,320 --> 01:50:17,000
I thought I should dutifully
return it back to her...

2026
01:50:17,040 --> 01:50:18,840
I have gone mental!

2027
01:50:20,400 --> 01:50:22,080
I did all this.

2028
01:50:22,439 --> 01:50:25,200
But she doesn't even know I love her.

2029
01:50:25,719 --> 01:50:27,320
She doesn't need to know.

2030
01:50:27,559 --> 01:50:29,719
As long as she is happy,
that's enough.

2031
01:50:29,759 --> 01:50:32,839
I'm not a beggar like you
who falls in love with every woman I see.

2032
01:50:33,040 --> 01:50:35,200
She was the only person I loved.

2033
01:50:35,320 --> 01:50:37,799
I don't care if I don't get her

2034
01:50:37,839 --> 01:50:40,239
But a womanizer like you
doesn't deserve her!

2035
01:50:40,400 --> 01:50:43,479
If you still try to come into her life,
I'll just stab you!

2036
01:51:21,320 --> 01:51:22,280
Junior!

2037
01:51:22,639 --> 01:51:24,320
You thought I was a cheap guy?

2038
01:51:24,679 --> 01:51:26,400
I might even betray women

2039
01:51:26,679 --> 01:51:28,200
But I'd never betray friendship.

2040
01:51:28,240 --> 01:51:31,320
Even if I call you my side-kick,
I deeply care about you.

2041
01:51:31,400 --> 01:51:32,559
Your brother told me,

2042
01:51:32,599 --> 01:51:34,519
He's carrying the slipper
around everywhere.

2043
01:51:34,559 --> 01:51:36,439
He's getting the slipper
fixed at the cobbler's

2044
01:51:36,479 --> 01:51:38,320
I knew something happened to you.

2045
01:51:38,360 --> 01:51:41,080
I arranged for the boys
to pinch the memory card from you.

2046
01:51:41,120 --> 01:51:42,920
I saw all the photos in the memory card.

2047
01:51:42,960 --> 01:51:46,880
I was shocked...
The junior has outdone the mentor.

2048
01:51:47,080 --> 01:51:50,519
I forwarded all the photos
through WhatsApp to Sandhya.

2049
01:51:50,920 --> 01:51:52,920
You know what she said
upon seeing those photos?

2050
01:51:52,960 --> 01:51:53,840
What did she say?

2051
01:51:53,879 --> 01:51:55,479
That she wanted to see you immediately.

2052
01:51:55,559 --> 01:51:57,479
If I just say it,
where is the surprise in that?

2053
01:51:57,519 --> 01:52:00,400
I thought I'd give you a bouquet
of flowers, to give it to her...

2054
01:52:00,519 --> 01:52:04,080
But before that you've beaten me so bad,
and made the bouquet into broomstick!

2055
01:52:04,120 --> 01:52:05,760
- Sorry!
- What sorry?

2056
01:52:05,839 --> 01:52:06,959
It's 300 bucks.

2057
01:52:07,280 --> 01:52:11,719
Junior! Even if it wasn't at your level,
I was in love with Sandhya too.

2058
01:52:11,839 --> 01:52:15,360
Everyone saw me as a comedian,
but only you saw me as a villain.

2059
01:52:15,439 --> 01:52:16,599
That's your fault.

2060
01:52:16,839 --> 01:52:19,279
I'm giving up 'my' Sandhya for you.

2061
01:52:19,320 --> 01:52:21,840
Tell me now...
am I the villain, or the hero?

2062
01:52:21,879 --> 01:52:22,799
Bye!

2063
01:52:22,839 --> 01:52:24,719
Pick up that cap.

2064
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:25,960
Leader.

2065
01:52:26,040 --> 01:52:28,439
I got you two together!
Won't you do even this?

2066
01:52:30,639 --> 01:52:31,959
Where are you going?

2067
01:52:32,200 --> 01:52:34,920
Who knows where people go
when they go through a love failure?

2068
01:52:34,960 --> 01:52:37,520
But I'm going home.
Leave me, you be well.

2069
01:52:37,639 --> 01:52:39,039
Don't let go of him!

2070
01:53:35,240 --> 01:53:36,800
May I know your name?

2071
01:53:40,160 --> 01:53:41,840
I asked for your name.
