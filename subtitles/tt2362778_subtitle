1
00:06:31,871 --> 00:06:32,803
What's that?

2
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:33,903
Not that.

3
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:34,665
What is it?

4
00:06:34,774 --> 00:06:39,802
Not that. No!

5
00:06:45,485 --> 00:06:46,179
What's this for?

6
00:06:48,054 --> 00:06:50,079
People have an eye on you.

7
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:52,619
To get their hands on you.

8
00:06:54,227 --> 00:06:55,990
Will you kill them all?

9
00:06:58,098 --> 00:07:01,124
I will if needed...

10
00:07:02,702 --> 00:07:04,135
They are well-connected people.

11
00:07:04,938 --> 00:07:06,599
It's hard to escape them.

12
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:08,767
I will abduct you.

13
00:07:11,745 --> 00:07:13,770
I like your attitude.

14
00:07:14,781 --> 00:07:17,079
Don't waste them unnecessarily...

15
00:07:20,253 --> 00:07:22,721
I can't go through all this.

16
00:07:25,091 --> 00:07:26,820
I know.

17
00:07:28,628 --> 00:07:31,825
You need to be 'Handled with Care'.

18
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:41,869
The elections are
coming up next year.

19
00:07:42,509 --> 00:07:43,942
I was thinking of
running as a candidate.

20
00:07:45,612 --> 00:07:46,840
You will lose.

21
00:07:48,815 --> 00:07:50,077
I know.

22
00:07:52,118 --> 00:07:53,710
First time is only
to gain experience.

23
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,151
Next time, I will surely win.

24
00:07:55,655 --> 00:07:57,816
And then, we'll get married. Proudly.

25
00:07:58,625 --> 00:07:59,853
Okay?

26
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:05,591
You mean, another five years.

27
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,925
Oh, yes, five years.

28
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:11,637
What if you lose again?

29
00:08:11,938 --> 00:08:13,565
Then I'll have to abduct you.

30
00:08:16,442 --> 00:08:18,774
Why don't we get engaged till then?

31
00:08:21,447 --> 00:08:22,436
Here.

32
00:08:25,084 --> 00:08:31,580
Prince Inderjeet Singh
with Princess Ranjana.

33
00:09:07,727 --> 00:09:08,716
What's this for, sister-in-law?

34
00:09:08,828 --> 00:09:10,455
Param's got ajob
with the police force.

35
00:09:10,563 --> 00:09:12,793
Very good. Bravo.

36
00:09:12,899 --> 00:09:14,799
He's younger to you.

37
00:09:15,068 --> 00:09:17,059
Yes, but he's still my brother.

38
00:09:17,203 --> 00:09:18,898
Now he's a police officer.

39
00:09:24,911 --> 00:09:28,745
On his way to Jhansi.

40
00:09:31,251 --> 00:09:33,048
Where are you going
dressed so quaintly?

41
00:09:33,586 --> 00:09:35,713
Did you join the circus?

42
00:09:35,889 --> 00:09:37,857
There's a political
meeting at the town square.

43
00:09:37,957 --> 00:09:39,857
I've been invited to give a speech.

44
00:09:40,693 --> 00:09:43,025
If you find the time,
come and root for me.

45
00:09:43,263 --> 00:09:46,664
Don't start abusing instead.

46
00:09:48,501 --> 00:09:49,593
Otherwise, I will have to come
down to the police station again...

47
00:09:49,702 --> 00:09:50,634
...to bail you out.

48
00:09:50,737 --> 00:09:54,605
Father, people love
to hear me cuss as well.

49
00:09:54,741 --> 00:09:58,507
You're a teacher,
but people call me 'Raja Bhaiyya'.

50
00:10:08,788 --> 00:10:09,982
Good day, Raja Bhaiyya.

51
00:10:10,723 --> 00:10:11,246
Everyone's here?

52
00:10:11,524 --> 00:10:12,957
We're just waiting for Mr. Mehra.

53
00:10:13,059 --> 00:10:14,617
Go inside and take a seat.

54
00:10:14,727 --> 00:10:15,751
Who is Mehra?

55
00:10:15,862 --> 00:10:17,523
Did you tell him I am coming?
- Yes, I did.

56
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:19,495
Come on, let's go. - Let's Go.

57
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:23,000
This way. - Listen.

58
00:10:25,138 --> 00:10:26,969
Keep this. That's 2000. - Yes.

59
00:10:27,106 --> 00:10:28,767
Publish my photo
in the newspaper. - Yes.

60
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:30,206
Come, brother. This way.

61
00:10:31,844 --> 00:10:33,004
Come, brother.

62
00:10:35,848 --> 00:10:38,578
Are the arrangements okay?
- Wonderful.

63
00:10:44,557 --> 00:10:46,184
Hello, sir. - Welcome, Mr. Mehra.

64
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:55,657
Take it.

65
00:11:40,713 --> 00:11:42,943
Will I have to come
down to the police station?

66
00:11:50,256 --> 00:11:51,223
Stop.

67
00:11:51,557 --> 00:11:52,683
Stop.

68
00:11:59,799 --> 00:12:00,891
Stop.

69
00:12:05,671 --> 00:12:08,538
Listen to me, brother.

70
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:12,709
Brother... listen to me.

71
00:12:13,079 --> 00:12:14,808
Stand up. - Brother...

72
00:12:19,886 --> 00:12:21,751
I paid you for the
entire face. - Yes.

73
00:12:21,854 --> 00:12:22,821
All you published was my hand.

74
00:12:22,922 --> 00:12:25,186
Yes.

75
00:12:28,094 --> 00:12:29,721
I will return your money.

76
00:12:29,829 --> 00:12:31,694
All of it. Every cent.

77
00:12:32,165 --> 00:12:35,066
What? - I swear.
I will return the money.

78
00:12:35,168 --> 00:12:36,533
You think I was beating
you for the money.

79
00:12:36,636 --> 00:12:37,762
No...

80
00:12:45,111 --> 00:12:50,708
Experts feel that this
election will be fought...

81
00:12:50,817 --> 00:12:53,012
...on just one issue,
and that's division of the state.

82
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:56,750
The government will have to...

83
00:13:01,661 --> 00:13:04,824
I hope you will cure me
before the next elections, Bakshi.

84
00:13:05,598 --> 00:13:08,158
You will be walking without
any support within a year.

85
00:13:08,601 --> 00:13:10,068
That's my guarantee.

86
00:13:12,271 --> 00:13:13,898
Slowly.

87
00:13:21,848 --> 00:13:24,078
Which fool brought these video games?

88
00:13:25,751 --> 00:13:28,242
He doesn't want me to get well soon.

89
00:13:29,255 --> 00:13:33,214
I want to dance without
anyone's support.

90
00:13:35,194 --> 00:13:36,661
Greetings, Her Highness.

91
00:13:39,899 --> 00:13:42,129
Son, I want to see you dance as well.

92
00:13:43,736 --> 00:13:45,294
Greetings, Rani Ma.

93
00:13:45,972 --> 00:13:47,132
After you're cured...

94
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:50,107
...your first duty is to
give this family a successor.

95
00:13:54,547 --> 00:13:58,278
Your daughter-in-law
is no longer fit for this job.

96
00:13:58,951 --> 00:14:01,579
She's just my official wife now.

97
00:14:02,488 --> 00:14:06,254
And the government's
good for nothing.

98
00:14:07,126 --> 00:14:09,060
Then get married again.

99
00:14:09,862 --> 00:14:12,057
How did come up with that idea?

100
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:16,135
It's like showing
Switzerland to the blind.

101
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:25,234
Ranjana. Bunny's daughter.

102
00:14:29,849 --> 00:14:32,079
Did you have a word? - Yes.

103
00:14:36,622 --> 00:14:38,749
So, should we start
packing for Switzerland?

104
00:14:46,632 --> 00:14:50,659
Hello, lt's Rudra Singh.

105
00:14:52,972 --> 00:14:55,133
Hi, Rudy. How are you?

106
00:14:55,575 --> 00:14:57,099
There's a problem.

107
00:14:57,643 --> 00:15:00,077
Official? - No, personal.

108
00:15:01,113 --> 00:15:02,705
Woman.

109
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:09,149
The government took away our powers,
but not nature.

110
00:15:10,022 --> 00:15:11,717
So, who was it?

111
00:15:12,792 --> 00:15:15,590
Dhanraj Makhija,
a businessman from Agra.

112
00:15:17,663 --> 00:15:20,564
I would get him small
tenders in my area.

113
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:23,100
One day he visited me
in the hotel with his wife.

114
00:15:23,502 --> 00:15:26,528
This time,
it was a 2 million bridge tender.

115
00:15:26,839 --> 00:15:30,104
Rudra Pratap. Remember I told you...

116
00:15:30,209 --> 00:15:31,870
I'm sure the bridge was
constructed the same day.

117
00:15:31,978 --> 00:15:34,173
The rascal made a video.

118
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,508
He's threatening me now.

119
00:15:35,615 --> 00:15:37,845
Wants all the tenders in the area.

120
00:15:38,217 --> 00:15:41,618
A businessman,
who's not scared of the MLA.

121
00:15:41,854 --> 00:15:44,687
You must be the only
politician in the country...

122
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:46,517
...who doesn't scare anybody.

123
00:15:46,692 --> 00:15:48,853
Forget that, what's the solution?

124
00:15:49,629 --> 00:15:54,066
Makhija's trying to blackmail you,
using his wife.

125
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:55,733
Possible.

126
00:15:56,168 --> 00:15:59,069
Maybe he wants to
get rid of his wife too.

127
00:15:59,905 --> 00:16:02,567
But, I'm sure his wife
has no clue about it.

128
00:16:03,109 --> 00:16:05,873
And you will tell her.

129
00:16:06,612 --> 00:16:09,843
And explain her everything
while wiping her tears.

130
00:16:10,683 --> 00:16:14,449
Where to bring him, how?

131
00:16:15,521 --> 00:16:17,751
And yes, he should be alone.

132
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:19,216
We've been going around in circles.

133
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:20,819
Was it the one we just passed by?

134
00:16:20,926 --> 00:16:24,259
How would a factory
look in such a small space?

135
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:26,464
Rudy's giving us a big contract.

136
00:16:26,599 --> 00:16:28,226
He wants us to see the land.

137
00:16:28,501 --> 00:16:30,594
But you've no patience.

138
00:16:30,836 --> 00:16:32,463
It's not about patience.

139
00:16:32,605 --> 00:16:34,971
We're no longer in Rudy's area.

140
00:16:35,508 --> 00:16:37,100
And this is Aditya
Pratap Singh's area.

141
00:16:37,209 --> 00:16:39,040
Yes, so what? They're friends.

142
00:16:39,145 --> 00:16:40,203
Maybe they're planning
something together.

143
00:16:40,479 --> 00:16:41,741
Be quiet.

144
00:17:04,637 --> 00:17:07,105
No need to fear anyone.

145
00:17:07,707 --> 00:17:08,867
Except me.

146
00:17:09,709 --> 00:17:12,576
Inform the police 15 minutes later.

147
00:17:22,621 --> 00:17:24,612
Send 50,000 to the police station.

148
00:17:24,724 --> 00:17:25,850
Yes.

149
00:17:43,876 --> 00:17:48,711
Hail! Hail! Hail! Hail!

150
00:17:48,814 --> 00:17:53,615
Hail! Hail! Hail! Hail!

151
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,053
Let's get out of here.

152
00:17:56,756 --> 00:17:59,657
Yes. - Sir, the police
have arrested my son-in-law.

153
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:03,593
They arrested him for stealing.
- Call from the CM's office.

154
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:05,595
Say that I will call him later.

155
00:18:05,698 --> 00:18:07,825
And, Kanhaiyya, call the SP?

156
00:18:07,933 --> 00:18:12,029
The irrigation process between
Satpalgaj to Mejha is stalled.

157
00:18:12,571 --> 00:18:14,061
The budget's been sanctioned.

158
00:18:14,173 --> 00:18:16,198
But ma'am hasn't signed it yet.

159
00:18:16,642 --> 00:18:20,100
Leave the file here.
Collect it in the evening.

160
00:18:24,483 --> 00:18:26,610
And, take me to Choti Rani,
I want to talk to her.

161
00:18:26,719 --> 00:18:27,708
Yes.

162
00:18:29,722 --> 00:18:32,088
Rudy. I'll see you
in 10 minutes. - Okay.

163
00:18:37,062 --> 00:18:38,154
Choti Rani!

164
00:18:42,968 --> 00:18:44,026
Madhvi.

165
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:50,899
Madhvi!

166
00:19:07,793 --> 00:19:09,090
Madhvi!

167
00:19:17,136 --> 00:19:18,228
You!

168
00:19:19,605 --> 00:19:21,072
When did you arrive?

169
00:19:22,441 --> 00:19:24,170
You're not well.

170
00:19:24,443 --> 00:19:26,035
I am absolutely fine.

171
00:19:26,745 --> 00:19:29,236
First, go wear something decent.

172
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:34,715
I've forsaken all
decency in front of you.

173
00:19:35,254 --> 00:19:37,518
So, why this formality?

174
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:41,453
You call me by my name now.

175
00:19:41,861 --> 00:19:47,766
Earlier, you would say
'Choti Rani' so romantically.

176
00:19:50,169 --> 00:19:53,161
Let me warn you. - Yes.

177
00:19:53,272 --> 00:19:55,968
Don't try to seduce me.

178
00:19:56,742 --> 00:19:58,733
I won't fall for that again.

179
00:19:59,612 --> 00:20:01,807
And you don't look
nice doing all this.

180
00:20:02,181 --> 00:20:04,877
I feel like paying for it.

181
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:09,077
Fine, pay me.
That will make me happy.

182
00:20:09,188 --> 00:20:11,679
You've become so cheap.

183
00:20:12,558 --> 00:20:14,890
I don't have loose
change to spare for you...

184
00:20:16,295 --> 00:20:18,092
You're the local MLA.

185
00:20:19,832 --> 00:20:21,561
I'm leaving this file behind.

186
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,859
Sign them when you're
back to your senses.

187
00:20:25,271 --> 00:20:26,203
Kanhaiyya.

188
00:20:27,139 --> 00:20:28,629
Saheb. I need some money...

189
00:20:28,741 --> 00:20:29,230
Kanhaiyya.

190
00:20:29,508 --> 00:20:30,600
I've spent it all.

191
00:20:30,709 --> 00:20:32,199
Saheb. Saheb, please.

192
00:20:32,311 --> 00:20:34,802
Saheb, I really need money.

193
00:20:43,856 --> 00:20:45,619
Come on, move your hands faster.

194
00:20:45,724 --> 00:20:47,555
It'll start raining any moment.

195
00:20:51,096 --> 00:20:53,564
Bunny uncle's sent an invitation.

196
00:20:53,966 --> 00:20:55,092
Polo Match.

197
00:20:55,668 --> 00:20:56,726
Will you go?

198
00:20:57,670 --> 00:20:58,728
No.

199
00:20:59,038 --> 00:21:01,063
He didn't reply to my proposal.

200
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,232
No need to go.

201
00:21:03,876 --> 00:21:06,902
I wouldn't have if you hadn't
shown me Ranjana's picture.

202
00:21:07,846 --> 00:21:08,972
We'll go.

203
00:21:09,682 --> 00:21:10,842
We will all go.

204
00:21:13,052 --> 00:21:14,883
We've to win this match.

205
00:21:22,728 --> 00:21:24,059
Greetings, Her Highness.

206
00:21:25,531 --> 00:21:26,623
Hello, Her Highness.

207
00:21:26,932 --> 00:21:27,899
Polo match?

208
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,997
Looking for a groom for Rachna?

209
00:21:30,569 --> 00:21:33,265
You know everything that
goes around in this kingdom.

210
00:21:33,639 --> 00:21:35,732
I'll come to you when
I start looking for one.

211
00:21:36,909 --> 00:21:39,241
How are you, Madhvi?
- Very well, uncle.

212
00:21:39,511 --> 00:21:40,671
Is Vishi back from Dubai?

213
00:21:40,779 --> 00:21:42,542
He'll be here soon.

214
00:21:42,648 --> 00:21:44,172
Maybe his flight is delayed.

215
00:21:45,084 --> 00:21:46,813
Welcome.

216
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:53,517
Hi Aditya.

217
00:21:59,031 --> 00:22:01,932
Did you forget about my proposal...

218
00:22:02,167 --> 00:22:04,226
...or, you didn't
think it was important?

219
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:06,599
Let's go inside and talk.

220
00:22:06,772 --> 00:22:08,831
People are eagerly waiting for you.

221
00:22:10,142 --> 00:22:12,269
Hello, Sheena, how are you? - Hello?

222
00:22:13,245 --> 00:22:14,212
How are you?

223
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,141
I'm fine, how about you?

224
00:22:16,615 --> 00:22:17,604
Yeah.

225
00:22:17,716 --> 00:22:19,047
Hi.

226
00:22:19,151 --> 00:22:21,210
Hello, Ranjana. - Hello.

227
00:22:21,487 --> 00:22:23,148
How are you?
- I'm fine, how about you?

228
00:22:23,255 --> 00:22:24,620
So, what're you up to these days?

229
00:22:24,723 --> 00:22:26,122
Looking nice. - You too.

230
00:22:26,225 --> 00:22:27,624
Thank you.

231
00:22:30,562 --> 00:22:31,824
Cheers.

232
00:22:36,035 --> 00:22:36,763
Hello.

233
00:22:36,869 --> 00:22:38,666
Sir's busy in a meeting.

234
00:22:38,771 --> 00:22:39,965
He'll call you back later.

235
00:22:40,072 --> 00:22:41,164
Yes, sir.

236
00:22:45,744 --> 00:22:47,939
Didn't you take
a bullet in the chest?

237
00:22:50,516 --> 00:22:52,108
Your master survived as well.

238
00:22:53,886 --> 00:22:55,319
Yes. - How?

239
00:22:57,923 --> 00:23:01,757
Those who speak less, live longer.

240
00:23:02,928 --> 00:23:06,887
So you think by doing
this we'll be richer.

241
00:23:06,999 --> 00:23:08,557
You can consider that.

242
00:23:08,701 --> 00:23:11,829
With four different states,
we'll receive more funds.

243
00:23:11,937 --> 00:23:12,961
More development.

244
00:23:13,072 --> 00:23:15,666
But, you will still be
in power in all the four states.

245
00:23:15,774 --> 00:23:17,264
You will benefit
from the development.

246
00:23:17,643 --> 00:23:20,874
I... am not in favor
of dividing Uttar Pradesh.

247
00:23:20,979 --> 00:23:24,642
This can be your personal view,
but the other MLA's...

248
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:26,081
That's them.

249
00:23:26,618 --> 00:23:27,915
Ask them.

250
00:23:28,253 --> 00:23:30,244
Listen. Where did they come from?

251
00:23:30,522 --> 00:23:32,114
They are sitting there.

252
00:23:32,524 --> 00:23:33,786
I see. - Yes.

253
00:23:33,992 --> 00:23:35,619
I see.

254
00:23:36,295 --> 00:23:38,855
Hello, Virender Singh.

255
00:23:38,964 --> 00:23:43,196
Look, I must know the
number of MLA's supporting us.

256
00:23:43,302 --> 00:23:45,964
Only after that,
will I bring this up in the assembly.

257
00:23:51,276 --> 00:23:53,107
Mr. Tiwari. - Yes.

258
00:23:53,779 --> 00:23:56,976
We'll discuss this
personally and let you know.

259
00:23:57,216 --> 00:23:59,548
Fine. But, hurry up.

260
00:23:59,651 --> 00:24:02,211
Because the CM's facing
a lot of pressure.

261
00:24:02,488 --> 00:24:03,978
And, please control him.

262
00:24:04,089 --> 00:24:06,751
Every issue is a
matter of pride for him.

263
00:24:06,859 --> 00:24:08,850
We'll let you know soon.

264
00:24:08,961 --> 00:24:10,087
What happened?

265
00:24:10,195 --> 00:24:12,060
I'm certainly losing this election.

266
00:24:12,164 --> 00:24:14,655
Because there's been
no development in my area.

267
00:24:14,867 --> 00:24:17,495
And now, no one will
vote you for who you are.

268
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:19,895
And now, we're running independently.

269
00:24:20,005 --> 00:24:21,495
Where will the funds come from?

270
00:24:21,974 --> 00:24:22,998
Quiet!

271
00:24:23,609 --> 00:24:26,100
People address us as 'Rajaji' (king).

272
00:24:26,612 --> 00:24:29,012
If we separate, we'll lose power.

273
00:24:29,114 --> 00:24:31,674
We'll have to join his party and
then, I'll be called a politician.

274
00:24:31,784 --> 00:24:33,752
It's not music to my ears.

275
00:24:35,754 --> 00:24:38,120
There are other
ways to collect funds.

276
00:24:38,223 --> 00:24:40,987
Let's discuss this later.

277
00:24:42,227 --> 00:24:43,819
It's time.

278
00:24:44,496 --> 00:24:46,657
The horses must be getting restless.

279
00:24:47,699 --> 00:24:48,597
Come on.

280
00:24:48,867 --> 00:24:49,891
Let's move.

281
00:24:50,002 --> 00:24:51,094
Let's go.

282
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:52,964
Bunny uncle.

283
00:24:54,139 --> 00:24:55,697
We need to talk.

284
00:24:56,175 --> 00:24:57,073
Don't worry.

285
00:24:57,576 --> 00:24:58,736
It's a different issue.

286
00:24:58,844 --> 00:25:00,937
Is it true? - One moment.

287
00:25:02,915 --> 00:25:04,644
Is everything okay? - Yes thank you.

288
00:25:14,993 --> 00:25:15,925
What were you doing?

289
00:25:16,195 --> 00:25:17,219
We've guests over.

290
00:25:17,496 --> 00:25:18,827
I was with them.

291
00:25:18,931 --> 00:25:20,626
Yes, I saw them coming.

292
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,465
They didn't look royal to me.

293
00:25:24,002 --> 00:25:26,630
They look more like
government officials.

294
00:25:27,573 --> 00:25:31,805
They've lost what we still maintain.

295
00:25:33,645 --> 00:25:34,942
Do you get it?

296
00:25:35,948 --> 00:25:37,609
They can't ride a horse?

297
00:25:37,716 --> 00:25:39,240
What do you want to say?

298
00:25:39,718 --> 00:25:41,515
Are they discussing your marriage?

299
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,615
Not that I heard of.

300
00:25:44,923 --> 00:25:46,948
You want to marry Ranjana.

301
00:25:47,526 --> 00:25:48,754
How?

302
00:25:49,528 --> 00:25:52,190
Okay, you might start
walking in a year or two.

303
00:25:52,698 --> 00:25:54,131
But you're a married man.

304
00:25:54,633 --> 00:25:57,898
Bunny uncle,
you sound like a democratic.

305
00:25:58,637 --> 00:25:59,968
I am a king!

306
00:26:00,672 --> 00:26:02,572
I can afford an extra wife.

307
00:26:02,841 --> 00:26:05,571
And I don't need any
government fund for that.

308
00:26:05,677 --> 00:26:07,736
I heard that Aditya
Pratap Singh's here too.

309
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:09,638
Yes.

310
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:13,741
How does he look?

311
00:26:15,187 --> 00:26:17,451
They all look the
same on a wheelchair.

312
00:26:18,123 --> 00:26:19,454
Helpless.

313
00:26:22,594 --> 00:26:24,653
He took a bullet, but survived.

314
00:26:25,564 --> 00:26:26,826
I know.

315
00:26:29,001 --> 00:26:30,764
Do you know why he survived?

316
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,801
He has to die by my hands.

317
00:26:37,209 --> 00:26:40,645
It's not possible. - Only if you try.

318
00:26:41,213 --> 00:26:42,612
And you can.

319
00:26:43,048 --> 00:26:45,141
You're a king, so am I.

320
00:26:45,717 --> 00:26:51,087
But your blood's cooled down,
not mine.

321
00:27:52,951 --> 00:27:53,918
Hello.

322
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:55,987
Yes, son.

323
00:27:57,189 --> 00:27:58,121
What?

324
00:28:00,292 --> 00:28:01,953
Who... who's with you?

325
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:04,153
Pardon me, Your Highness.
But, master wants to speak.

326
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:05,922
Don't you see I'm
speaking over the phone.

327
00:28:06,031 --> 00:28:07,123
It's important.

328
00:28:07,632 --> 00:28:09,623
This is just as much important.

329
00:28:12,037 --> 00:28:13,698
Call from Dubai?

330
00:28:14,906 --> 00:28:19,673
I heard that your son Vishi
was caught red-handed with drugs.

331
00:28:21,713 --> 00:28:23,977
They've strict laws.

332
00:28:24,683 --> 00:28:27,117
And drugs is a serious offence.

333
00:28:29,855 --> 00:28:32,756
You're such a lowly man.

334
00:28:33,492 --> 00:28:37,019
If I can get your son in
trouble in Dubai from here...

335
00:28:37,129 --> 00:28:41,122
...then your home's
just 300 kilometers away.

336
00:28:42,934 --> 00:28:46,893
I can get Ranjana abducted.

337
00:28:48,707 --> 00:28:52,108
Many kings have abducted
their brides in the past.

338
00:28:52,811 --> 00:28:56,144
We don't call them lowly but gallant.

339
00:28:59,584 --> 00:29:03,020
A few affluent Sheiks in
Dubai studied with me in London.

340
00:29:03,522 --> 00:29:05,513
We're good friends.

341
00:29:05,791 --> 00:29:07,850
Come down to my place with the token.

342
00:29:07,959 --> 00:29:10,052
I'll keep Ranjana happy.

343
00:29:24,576 --> 00:29:27,943
You have forgotten our
relationship by mistake.

344
00:29:29,081 --> 00:29:31,572
Didn't you think it
necessary to keep it in mind?

345
00:29:33,652 --> 00:29:37,452
If I can get your son in
trouble in Dubai from here...

346
00:29:37,556 --> 00:29:41,549
...then your home's
just 300 kilometers away.

347
00:29:51,703 --> 00:29:54,763
Father, did you just fire a bullet?

348
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:58,171
Yes. I did.

349
00:29:59,111 --> 00:30:00,510
But why?

350
00:30:03,215 --> 00:30:04,910
I wanted to kill myself.

351
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:07,945
But then, I thought about you.

352
00:30:09,488 --> 00:30:10,284
Sit.

353
00:30:13,758 --> 00:30:15,658
That's fate.

354
00:30:15,861 --> 00:30:18,694
Sure you got ajob,
but where did you get transferred?

355
00:30:18,797 --> 00:30:19,923
Do you get me?

356
00:30:20,031 --> 00:30:21,658
Listen.

357
00:30:22,167 --> 00:30:25,295
God's trying to say something to you.

358
00:30:26,972 --> 00:30:28,667
Here, talk to brother.

359
00:30:31,309 --> 00:30:34,039
Yes, Param. When are you joining?

360
00:30:34,146 --> 00:30:35,738
Speak slowly.

361
00:30:36,181 --> 00:30:39,014
No, I could send...
- Yes, Your Highness.

362
00:30:40,051 --> 00:30:41,678
I'll send your stuff over.

363
00:30:42,053 --> 00:30:44,078
You mean, I am more like security.

364
00:30:44,556 --> 00:30:46,683
If you hand me over,
brother will be set free.

365
00:30:46,791 --> 00:30:48,622
We've been humiliated, dear.

366
00:30:49,127 --> 00:30:51,994
Aditya Pratap Singh has mortified us.

367
00:30:52,197 --> 00:30:54,563
I am retaliating.

368
00:30:54,866 --> 00:30:56,857
And you are my weapon.

369
00:30:57,669 --> 00:30:59,068
That doesn't make sense.

370
00:30:59,171 --> 00:31:00,160
What can I possibly do?

371
00:31:00,272 --> 00:31:01,671
I am not sending you alone.

372
00:31:01,773 --> 00:31:03,934
Your Highness,
Inderjeet Singh's here.

373
00:31:04,643 --> 00:31:05,837
Send him in.

374
00:31:09,114 --> 00:31:10,581
Your Highness.

375
00:31:14,019 --> 00:31:15,486
You played well today.

376
00:31:15,587 --> 00:31:16,713
Three of our riders were tired...

377
00:31:16,821 --> 00:31:18,288
...otherwise,
I would have scored two more goals.

378
00:31:18,557 --> 00:31:19,581
And then...

379
00:31:19,691 --> 00:31:21,591
Why did you hit the
ball towards Aditya Singh?

380
00:31:22,827 --> 00:31:23,725
It was a mistake.

381
00:31:23,828 --> 00:31:26,160
I wanted to turn,
but the horse didn't...

382
00:31:26,264 --> 00:31:28,164
...so the shot went straight.

383
00:31:34,105 --> 00:31:35,629
You did the right thing.

384
00:31:37,008 --> 00:31:38,066
What?

385
00:31:38,877 --> 00:31:41,107
I know that wasn't a mistake.

386
00:31:41,213 --> 00:31:42,703
You were trying to fuel the war...

387
00:31:42,814 --> 00:31:45,078
...your grandfather lost
to Aditya Singh's family.

388
00:31:47,052 --> 00:31:49,282
You were just inflaming that.

389
00:31:51,156 --> 00:31:53,090
It was a mistake, Your Highness.

390
00:31:53,325 --> 00:31:55,555
I couldn't control myself.

391
00:31:56,027 --> 00:31:58,325
Aditya Singh wants to marry Ranjana.

392
00:31:58,630 --> 00:31:59,619
When I refused...

393
00:31:59,731 --> 00:32:01,961
...he got my son arrested
for drugs in Dubai,

394
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,929
I'm giving my approval
for the engagement.

395
00:32:04,469 --> 00:32:08,132
But... I want Aditya
Singh dead before the wedding.

396
00:32:08,773 --> 00:32:11,765
The government wants
to finish his power.

397
00:32:12,811 --> 00:32:14,802
And I want his honor...

398
00:32:15,981 --> 00:32:17,949
You can take his life,
if you're interested.

399
00:32:20,952 --> 00:32:22,112
Look.

400
00:32:23,488 --> 00:32:25,956
Channel your anger properly.

401
00:32:26,858 --> 00:32:30,055
Kings don't look
nice out on the streets.

402
00:32:30,161 --> 00:32:31,992
Please listen to me...

403
00:32:32,097 --> 00:32:35,032
I just don't understand.
This doesn't feel right.

404
00:32:35,133 --> 00:32:36,191
Your Highness.

405
00:32:36,301 --> 00:32:40,601
I can end my war by
taking Aditya Singh's life.

406
00:32:41,239 --> 00:32:45,835
But, finishing his power
and honor will take time.

407
00:32:46,578 --> 00:32:51,880
And, after that's done,
I would like to marry Ranjana.

408
00:32:52,517 --> 00:32:54,041
Trying to take advantage?

409
00:32:55,153 --> 00:32:57,280
That means,
I will have to fight with you next.

410
00:32:57,656 --> 00:32:58,987
I accept.

411
00:34:31,282 --> 00:34:33,614
You want this war, don't you?

412
00:34:33,985 --> 00:34:35,213
So be it.

413
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:38,013
And it'll be a fierce one.

414
00:34:38,723 --> 00:34:40,486
Swear on you.

415
00:35:04,783 --> 00:35:06,045
It wasn't supposed to be like this.

416
00:35:06,217 --> 00:35:07,775
Come with me. Ratan.

417
00:35:07,886 --> 00:35:09,513
Yes, Her Highness.
- What are you doing?

418
00:35:09,621 --> 00:35:12,146
See whether the red lamp's
been lit or not. Okay?

419
00:35:12,257 --> 00:35:14,919
Light-up all the lamps.

420
00:35:15,026 --> 00:35:16,721
Hurry up, and I want this polished...

421
00:35:17,896 --> 00:35:19,864
Listen. What's going on here?

422
00:35:19,964 --> 00:35:21,761
The master has thrown a party...

423
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:23,128
Go.

424
00:35:55,867 --> 00:35:57,732
I hope you didn't have
a problem finding the place.

425
00:35:57,836 --> 00:35:59,269
No, not at all.

426
00:36:04,976 --> 00:36:07,638
We saw a polo match
after a long time.

427
00:36:07,745 --> 00:36:08,973
Greetings.

428
00:36:09,914 --> 00:36:10,812
Hello.

429
00:36:10,915 --> 00:36:12,246
Hello, Madhvi.

430
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:15,610
I didn't know Saheb's thrown a party.

431
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:17,913
He didn't tell you? - No.

432
00:36:18,523 --> 00:36:21,583
No one tells me anything these days.

433
00:36:25,597 --> 00:36:27,929
You don't talk to me either.

434
00:36:28,132 --> 00:36:30,498
We would if you stay in your senses.

435
00:36:30,935 --> 00:36:32,994
Don't create a scene today, Madhvi.

436
00:36:33,104 --> 00:36:34,002
Why?

437
00:36:36,574 --> 00:36:38,474
Anything special?

438
00:37:30,161 --> 00:37:32,686
Your presence here is supporting.

439
00:37:33,131 --> 00:37:35,964
You know I was against it.

440
00:38:04,662 --> 00:38:07,790
Glittering dreams.

441
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:11,999
Beautiful dreams.

442
00:38:12,704 --> 00:38:15,901
Glittering dreams.

443
00:38:16,674 --> 00:38:19,700
Beautiful dreams.

444
00:38:19,944 --> 00:38:23,778
But... if you wake up...

445
00:38:24,048 --> 00:38:27,779
Dreams shatter like glass... Hey.

446
00:38:28,019 --> 00:38:31,580
Some fall here, some there.

447
00:38:31,923 --> 00:38:35,484
Hey.

448
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:39,726
Some fall here, some there.

449
00:38:39,964 --> 00:38:44,060
Hey.

450
00:38:58,683 --> 00:39:02,175
Careful with that platter.

451
00:39:02,587 --> 00:39:05,954
The drink's untouched.

452
00:39:06,524 --> 00:39:10,153
Don't let it slip.

453
00:39:10,628 --> 00:39:13,995
Or it's no good.

454
00:39:14,565 --> 00:39:16,499
All those dreams in your eyes.

455
00:39:16,601 --> 00:39:18,159
Will spill over.

456
00:39:18,436 --> 00:39:20,461
All those dreams in your eyes.

457
00:39:20,571 --> 00:39:21,799
Will spill over.

458
00:39:21,906 --> 00:39:25,672
Some which got spilt over...

459
00:39:25,910 --> 00:39:29,505
...some magical dreams.

460
00:39:29,914 --> 00:39:33,611
Some fall here, some there.

461
00:39:33,918 --> 00:39:37,615
Hey.

462
00:39:37,922 --> 00:39:41,688
Some fall here, some there.

463
00:39:41,926 --> 00:39:46,158
Hey.

464
00:40:08,019 --> 00:40:15,551
Love's divided here...
like a deck of cards.

465
00:40:16,027 --> 00:40:23,763
If you win the game, you get lucky.

466
00:40:24,068 --> 00:40:27,970
These mischievous dreams
are just an illusion.

467
00:40:28,072 --> 00:40:31,303
These mischievous
dreams are an illusion.

468
00:40:31,576 --> 00:40:38,982
If you let dust gather on it,
it's worth nothing.

469
00:40:39,517 --> 00:40:43,009
Some fall here, some there.

470
00:40:43,321 --> 00:40:47,621
Hey.

471
00:40:48,092 --> 00:40:51,118
Glittering dreams.

472
00:40:52,063 --> 00:40:55,624
Beautiful dreams.

473
00:40:56,067 --> 00:40:59,036
Glittering dreams.

474
00:41:00,071 --> 00:41:03,131
Beautiful dreams.

475
00:41:20,291 --> 00:41:22,259
Goodnight, Aditya, love you.

476
00:41:22,593 --> 00:41:25,619
Bye, Rudy. Bye.

477
00:41:35,206 --> 00:41:36,901
When will Vishi return?

478
00:41:37,108 --> 00:41:39,008
He'll be back in a day or two.

479
00:41:39,277 --> 00:41:41,643
All this is against everyone's will.

480
00:41:41,846 --> 00:41:43,837
Forsake your anger.

481
00:41:43,948 --> 00:41:45,643
It's the beginning of a new relation.

482
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:47,183
I'm not uttering a word.

483
00:41:47,985 --> 00:41:50,112
You asked Ranjana to stay back.

484
00:41:50,822 --> 00:41:51,811
Did I say a word?

485
00:41:52,023 --> 00:41:54,116
The only reason I asked
Ranjana to stay back...

486
00:41:54,258 --> 00:41:56,954
...is so that she could
understand me, know me better.

487
00:41:57,061 --> 00:41:57,823
If she stays here...

488
00:41:57,929 --> 00:41:59,760
What will the people
say if she stays here?

489
00:41:59,864 --> 00:42:01,559
I want her to see her defamed.

490
00:42:01,866 --> 00:42:05,563
So that anyone thinks twice
before sending a proposal.

491
00:43:13,604 --> 00:43:23,502
Come closer, because
this moment won't come again.

492
00:43:24,882 --> 00:43:34,154
Take me in your arms,
and let those tears fall.

493
00:43:35,893 --> 00:43:46,497
Wonder if love will
ever dwell in these eyes.

494
00:43:47,171 --> 00:43:57,775
We might not meet
again in this lifetime.

495
00:43:58,182 --> 00:44:02,482
Hold me close...

496
00:44:02,586 --> 00:44:04,816
Stop that music!

497
00:44:05,022 --> 00:44:09,186
...this night may...

498
00:44:19,804 --> 00:44:26,607
Glory to... - Madhvi ma'am!

499
00:44:26,711 --> 00:44:33,082
Glory to... - 'Choti Rani'!

500
00:44:42,159 --> 00:44:43,786
Did you sleep properly?

501
00:44:46,530 --> 00:44:47,588
Yes.

502
00:44:48,165 --> 00:44:51,157
I know you like photography.

503
00:44:52,603 --> 00:44:54,036
What else do you like?

504
00:44:54,672 --> 00:44:57,766
Why don't you tell me
about your likes and dislikes?

505
00:44:58,209 --> 00:44:59,836
I'll keep it in mind.

506
00:45:00,244 --> 00:45:02,610
My likes and dislikes
are not the law here.

507
00:45:02,713 --> 00:45:03,975
Seems like that.

508
00:45:04,181 --> 00:45:07,207
If I make a mistake,
I'll be punished.

509
00:45:07,485 --> 00:45:08,975
Don't say that.

510
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:13,247
I fell in love with your picture.

511
00:45:14,091 --> 00:45:19,723
Remember,
I'll just be an image for you.

512
00:45:23,601 --> 00:45:25,159
I won't make a mistake.

513
00:45:25,503 --> 00:45:29,701
I will keep trying...
to bring you to life.

514
00:45:31,709 --> 00:45:32,971
Remember.

515
00:45:33,144 --> 00:45:35,271
The day I get up from this chair...

516
00:45:36,914 --> 00:45:38,905
I'll marry you.

517
00:45:46,624 --> 00:45:47,852
Greetings.

518
00:45:52,596 --> 00:45:53,688
Greetings.

519
00:46:06,210 --> 00:46:07,768
I get it.

520
00:46:08,045 --> 00:46:09,706
I'll call you later.

521
00:46:14,218 --> 00:46:16,778
How's everything?
- Everything's fine.

522
00:46:16,887 --> 00:46:17,819
No problem at all.

523
00:46:17,922 --> 00:46:19,048
It's all your grace.

524
00:46:19,156 --> 00:46:21,886
I meant our area.

525
00:46:22,159 --> 00:46:24,684
There's prosperity in our area.

526
00:46:24,795 --> 00:46:25,921
Everyone's happy.

527
00:46:28,699 --> 00:46:29,666
What do you do?

528
00:46:29,767 --> 00:46:31,894
I am the PA to His Highness.

529
00:46:32,169 --> 00:46:33,602
His Highness?

530
00:46:33,838 --> 00:46:35,829
I mean, your PA.

531
00:46:37,007 --> 00:46:38,804
What are his appointments for today?

532
00:46:40,811 --> 00:46:42,711
Nothing important.

533
00:46:42,913 --> 00:46:45,609
I can see there's nothing
special going on here.

534
00:46:45,883 --> 00:46:47,248
People are simply loathing around.

535
00:46:47,518 --> 00:46:48,507
Loathing.

536
00:46:49,653 --> 00:46:50,711
Where's the money?

537
00:46:50,921 --> 00:46:52,218
Where does he keep the money?

538
00:46:52,823 --> 00:46:53,755
Money?

539
00:46:57,194 --> 00:46:58,491
Madam.

540
00:46:59,029 --> 00:47:00,519
There's no money here.

541
00:47:00,698 --> 00:47:02,097
Only sir keeps them.

542
00:47:03,767 --> 00:47:05,735
I need some money.

543
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:11,970
Madam... I've some money.

544
00:47:12,143 --> 00:47:14,008
I'll take them from sir later.

545
00:47:20,584 --> 00:47:23,644
How far is Jagdishpur?

546
00:47:49,079 --> 00:47:51,172
How long will you keep
up with this hunger strike?

547
00:47:51,649 --> 00:47:52,673
Greetings, Her Highness.

548
00:47:52,783 --> 00:47:54,580
Until our last breath.

549
00:47:54,685 --> 00:47:55,913
Come, sit.

550
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:59,985
How can they mow down
our fields and build a highway?

551
00:48:00,157 --> 00:48:03,024
That will change the entire
geography of the village.

552
00:48:03,961 --> 00:48:06,225
Her Highness,
what are you doing here?

553
00:48:06,497 --> 00:48:07,828
What brings you here?

554
00:48:07,932 --> 00:48:12,198
It's a hunger-strike,
I thought I should pay you a visit.

555
00:48:17,041 --> 00:48:19,771
If I don't, who else will?

556
00:48:19,877 --> 00:48:21,742
Our battle is with
the central government.

557
00:48:21,845 --> 00:48:24,040
It's not your fault.

558
00:48:24,215 --> 00:48:25,739
And, it's not in your power.

559
00:48:25,849 --> 00:48:27,248
So, what can you do?

560
00:48:27,518 --> 00:48:30,749
I know it's not within my power.

561
00:48:33,190 --> 00:48:36,819
But your grief's intolerable.

562
00:48:38,963 --> 00:48:41,796
Who's drinking?

563
00:48:42,933 --> 00:48:45,663
Umesh, you?

564
00:48:45,769 --> 00:48:47,168
Everyone's here on a hunger-strike...

565
00:48:47,271 --> 00:48:48,602
...and you're drunk.

566
00:48:48,706 --> 00:48:51,004
This is an agitation,
tie him up to the tree.

567
00:48:51,875 --> 00:48:52,273
Rascal.

568
00:48:52,543 --> 00:48:54,773
Let me know if you need anything.

569
00:48:54,878 --> 00:48:57,642
We need a lot of things,
Her Highness.

570
00:49:02,152 --> 00:49:03,585
I'll leave.

571
00:49:03,687 --> 00:49:06,155
I'll send you some help.

572
00:49:11,762 --> 00:49:12,888
Who is that?

573
00:49:13,130 --> 00:49:14,859
Hello, Madhvi.

574
00:49:14,965 --> 00:49:18,093
I hail from this area.

575
00:49:18,235 --> 00:49:19,668
I'm returning after
a number of years.

576
00:49:19,770 --> 00:49:22,762
So, I want to make an investment

577
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:25,074
Nothing special. I just
want to do something for my land.

578
00:49:25,175 --> 00:49:26,870
Is he the new collector?

579
00:49:27,511 --> 00:49:30,139
I'm not expecting profits,
just a big name for myself.

580
00:49:30,514 --> 00:49:31,981
First tell me your name...

581
00:49:32,149 --> 00:49:34,447
...then I'll tell you
a way to make it big.

582
00:49:34,551 --> 00:49:35,643
Inder.

583
00:49:35,853 --> 00:49:37,616
Inderjeet Singh...

584
00:49:40,190 --> 00:49:42,658
You take your name with pride.

585
00:49:43,727 --> 00:49:48,664
What can I do for you, Mr...
Inderjeet Singh.

586
00:49:49,166 --> 00:49:52,966
Just your support,
and soon you'll feel proud too.

587
00:49:56,573 --> 00:50:00,532
Why do I get always get men?

588
00:50:00,778 --> 00:50:03,804
Why not poets?

589
00:50:05,582 --> 00:50:08,745
I will learn, gradually.
In your company.

590
00:50:12,189 --> 00:50:14,521
You don't make a poet.

591
00:50:14,725 --> 00:50:16,784
They're born.

592
00:50:20,564 --> 00:50:23,590
You love someone.

593
00:50:25,869 --> 00:50:28,030
You never love someone.

594
00:50:29,306 --> 00:50:31,206
One always falls in love.

595
00:50:31,975 --> 00:50:33,203
And it shows.

596
00:50:33,544 --> 00:50:34,738
Leave that.

597
00:50:35,012 --> 00:50:36,206
What do you want?

598
00:50:37,915 --> 00:50:39,906
I'll be right back.

599
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:51,921
This is a donation for your party.

600
00:50:55,232 --> 00:50:57,826
I won independently.

601
00:50:58,035 --> 00:51:02,131
I have no party. - Yes.

602
00:51:06,076 --> 00:51:10,536
It's our first meeting,
I can't be too brazen.

603
00:51:28,732 --> 00:51:29,699
Keep up the hunger-strike.

604
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:30,824
We'll keep up this hunger-strike.

605
00:51:30,934 --> 00:51:32,697
Don't give up. - Never.

606
00:51:32,870 --> 00:51:34,929
Glory to... - Madhvi ma'am!

607
00:51:35,038 --> 00:51:37,097
Glory to... - 'Choti Rani'!

608
00:51:49,286 --> 00:51:50,878
Let's form a party then.

609
00:51:51,522 --> 00:51:53,217
You're now my treasurer.

610
00:51:54,091 --> 00:51:56,616
A man, poet and a treasurer.

611
00:51:57,528 --> 00:51:59,860
I need all three to look after me.

612
00:52:00,264 --> 00:52:01,891
Do you have a card?

613
00:52:03,834 --> 00:52:05,563
It's under print.

614
00:52:17,781 --> 00:52:19,578
You try.

615
00:52:19,950 --> 00:52:22,145
Guns don't interest me.

616
00:52:23,153 --> 00:52:25,519
I'm not interested in guns either.

617
00:52:26,223 --> 00:52:29,556
It's a necessity to stay alive.

618
00:52:33,197 --> 00:52:39,193
I've... taken up photography.
Like you.

619
00:52:43,173 --> 00:52:45,232
Pick up the gun.

620
00:52:46,109 --> 00:52:47,667
Here you go.

621
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:51,542
Take this.22.

622
00:52:51,715 --> 00:52:52,943
It's a one of the best rifles.

623
00:52:53,317 --> 00:52:55,217
Take it,
Vishi will be set free tomorrow.

624
00:53:16,507 --> 00:53:18,907
You won't applaud, right?

625
00:53:19,576 --> 00:53:21,544
Because, I might like it.

626
00:53:21,745 --> 00:53:22,905
Right.

627
00:53:23,146 --> 00:53:25,910
Hand me that gun. Come on.

628
00:53:28,652 --> 00:53:30,643
Looking at your condition...

629
00:53:30,754 --> 00:53:32,813
...its best to keep
this gun away from you.

630
00:53:36,693 --> 00:53:39,719
You don't always need
a gun to kill someone.

631
00:53:40,097 --> 00:53:41,860
Just like you took mine.

632
00:53:42,099 --> 00:53:43,589
No bullets fired.

633
00:53:43,767 --> 00:53:46,201
No accusations. Right?

634
00:53:48,939 --> 00:53:50,600
How do you like it here?

635
00:53:51,008 --> 00:53:53,272
Feels nice.

636
00:53:55,279 --> 00:53:57,804
You're getting used to this place.

637
00:53:58,715 --> 00:54:01,047
It's been just two days
and you're already lying.

638
00:54:01,151 --> 00:54:02,448
Madhvi!

639
00:54:03,487 --> 00:54:05,216
Sorry.

640
00:54:13,730 --> 00:54:16,790
What's wrong, Sunder? - Sir...

641
00:54:37,154 --> 00:54:38,883
Yes, dear. I know.

642
00:54:39,923 --> 00:54:41,254
It's a mad house.

643
00:54:41,525 --> 00:54:43,493
But I feel bad for Madhvi.

644
00:54:43,827 --> 00:54:44,919
I think she needs a doctor.

645
00:54:45,028 --> 00:54:47,792
That woman is very smart.

646
00:54:49,733 --> 00:54:51,257
Inder met her today.

647
00:54:51,535 --> 00:54:54,800
He charmed her and
she was more than willing.

648
00:54:55,706 --> 00:55:00,302
She said You can be my treasurer.

649
00:55:00,510 --> 00:55:02,171
Father, I'll talk to you later.

650
00:55:02,446 --> 00:55:04,107
Okay, dear. No problem.

651
00:55:21,131 --> 00:55:23,599
Do you have a license for this gun?

652
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:25,094
What the...

653
00:55:25,202 --> 00:55:26,499
Look at you.

654
00:55:27,471 --> 00:55:29,268
Something's still missing.

655
00:55:30,741 --> 00:55:32,641
You're just...
Greetings. - Okay, okay.

656
00:55:32,909 --> 00:55:35,275
I'm new on this job.
Give me some time.

657
00:55:35,545 --> 00:55:36,671
Soon, I'll look fitting.

658
00:55:36,780 --> 00:55:38,077
He's joined the police force.

659
00:55:38,181 --> 00:55:40,672
And do you know where
he's been posted?

660
00:55:41,551 --> 00:55:41,915
Here.

661
00:55:42,019 --> 00:55:43,714
That's been bothering me as well.

662
00:55:43,820 --> 00:55:45,788
I mean, out of all the places in UP.

663
00:55:46,189 --> 00:55:48,817
It's such a big coincidence,
Your Highness.

664
00:55:49,026 --> 00:55:51,824
This isn't fluke,
someone's pulling the strings.

665
00:55:52,496 --> 00:55:54,828
We aren't fighting without a reason.

666
00:55:55,532 --> 00:55:57,159
We're building an army.

667
00:56:20,157 --> 00:56:21,488
You need to check these files.

668
00:56:21,591 --> 00:56:24,651
Requests from irrigation,
forest and PWD departments.

669
00:56:35,539 --> 00:56:36,767
Greetings, madam.

670
00:56:40,644 --> 00:56:43,010
It's nice to see you here.

671
00:56:43,180 --> 00:56:45,011
There's a lawyer, Madhukar Asthana.

672
00:56:45,248 --> 00:56:46,875
He's filed a PIL against the DM...

673
00:56:46,983 --> 00:56:49,178
...regarding the road construction.

674
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:51,547
He's really troubled.

675
00:56:51,888 --> 00:56:54,686
And wants your help.

676
00:56:55,792 --> 00:56:58,590
What's... a PIL?

677
00:57:03,533 --> 00:57:04,727
Sir.

678
00:57:05,135 --> 00:57:06,193
Greetings, sir.

679
00:57:06,770 --> 00:57:07,668
Yes.

680
00:57:08,105 --> 00:57:09,629
He wants to speak to you.

681
00:57:10,741 --> 00:57:11,605
Yes.

682
00:57:11,708 --> 00:57:14,199
Suddenly, you just realized
your responsibilities.

683
00:57:14,711 --> 00:57:15,769
Good.

684
00:57:16,146 --> 00:57:17,841
You know how to sign.

685
00:57:18,048 --> 00:57:20,107
Just sign where I tell you to.

686
00:57:20,851 --> 00:57:24,480
If you need some money
take it from Sunder.

687
00:57:25,589 --> 00:57:27,682
Sir has sent some money.

688
00:57:30,794 --> 00:57:31,886
I don't need it.

689
00:57:31,995 --> 00:57:34,555
Sir... - You can go.

690
00:57:36,266 --> 00:57:37,494
Go.

691
00:57:47,677 --> 00:57:50,271
Does the car run smoothly?
- Yes, sir. It does.

692
00:57:50,714 --> 00:57:52,272
Kanta. - Yes, Your Highness.

693
00:57:52,549 --> 00:57:54,949
The shrubs have outgrown.
Get them trimmed.

694
00:57:55,085 --> 00:57:57,645
Your Highness, I'll get
some clothes stitched. - Yes.

695
00:57:57,754 --> 00:57:59,813
Ranjana has sent some designs,
they're just right.

696
00:57:59,923 --> 00:58:02,892
No need to ask me for everything.

697
00:58:03,226 --> 00:58:05,922
It's your money,
I'll have to keep an account.

698
00:58:06,096 --> 00:58:07,723
I'll deduct it. - What?

699
00:58:07,931 --> 00:58:09,592
Deduct? How?

700
00:58:09,699 --> 00:58:11,223
From your dowry.

701
00:58:13,036 --> 00:58:14,799
Yes, that's right.

702
00:58:15,472 --> 00:58:17,030
Madhvi's calling.

703
00:58:21,511 --> 00:58:23,672
I think she needs you.

704
00:58:25,048 --> 00:58:27,141
Keep your clothes on.

705
00:58:27,751 --> 00:58:29,514
She's takes them off.

706
00:58:29,886 --> 00:58:32,184
If your clothes come off...

707
00:58:32,722 --> 00:58:35,156
...you'll never be
able to repay my debt.

708
00:58:38,829 --> 00:58:40,456
No, Your Highness.

709
00:58:40,564 --> 00:58:42,657
I'm not that weak.

710
00:58:43,667 --> 00:58:46,227
Focus on the issue. - Yes.

711
00:58:46,603 --> 00:58:48,730
That's the only weakness
we kings have...

712
00:58:49,005 --> 00:58:50,666
...which turns into our defeat.

713
00:58:50,774 --> 00:58:53,004
Right? - Yes, that's true.

714
00:59:13,930 --> 00:59:15,192
It's Inder.

715
00:59:15,699 --> 00:59:17,599
You called? - Yes.

716
00:59:19,569 --> 00:59:21,662
Hello - I...

717
00:59:24,207 --> 00:59:24,969
Hello.

718
00:59:25,242 --> 00:59:28,609
I... need help. - Help for what?

719
00:59:33,783 --> 00:59:36,479
I want to learn politics.

720
00:59:36,853 --> 00:59:41,722
I want to learn politics.

721
00:59:42,792 --> 00:59:48,662
Madhvi, just like poets are born,
so are politicians.

722
00:59:48,932 --> 00:59:51,093
Why do you want to
learn such a vile thing?

723
00:59:51,201 --> 00:59:56,571
Just maintain your decree,
I will handle the politics.

724
00:59:56,673 --> 00:59:57,537
Okay?

725
01:00:03,546 --> 01:00:06,572
Hello, Mr. Tiwari - Hello.

726
01:00:07,150 --> 01:00:08,640
Good morning, sir.

727
01:00:21,665 --> 01:00:23,963
Sir, there's a letter
from the Ministry.

728
01:00:25,502 --> 01:00:29,495
And, there's another letter...

729
01:00:30,206 --> 01:00:31,138
Yes.

730
01:00:31,508 --> 01:00:33,772
Sir, the Collector
from Mejha is here.

731
01:00:34,010 --> 01:00:35,978
And ajournalist from the Indian Age.

732
01:00:36,079 --> 01:00:37,876
Indian Age? - Yes, sir.

733
01:00:38,315 --> 01:00:39,805
Send him in. - Yes, sir.

734
01:00:39,916 --> 01:00:41,713
Listen. - Yes, sir.

735
01:00:41,818 --> 01:00:44,309
Is it a man or a woman?

736
01:00:44,654 --> 01:00:47,145
It's a man. - I see.

737
01:00:47,991 --> 01:00:49,185
Fine, send him in.

738
01:00:49,693 --> 01:00:51,820
Sir, your signatures... - Go out.

739
01:01:18,922 --> 01:01:20,685
Good morning, sir. - Good morning.

740
01:01:20,790 --> 01:01:22,781
Please close the door.

741
01:01:22,926 --> 01:01:24,291
I see.

742
01:01:29,299 --> 01:01:32,029
I am Indrajeet Singh,
from the Indian Age. - Okay.

743
01:01:32,135 --> 01:01:35,195
We're starting a new column.

744
01:01:35,572 --> 01:01:38,302
We'll be publishing the profiles...

745
01:01:38,575 --> 01:01:39,872
...of the top five
politicians of the state.

746
01:01:40,010 --> 01:01:41,102
Profile?

747
01:01:41,311 --> 01:01:42,676
Please take a seat.

748
01:01:42,779 --> 01:01:44,872
Look, everyone publishes
about their work.

749
01:01:45,081 --> 01:01:46,673
How's the personality?

750
01:01:46,783 --> 01:01:48,614
Personality! How is it?

751
01:01:48,852 --> 01:01:51,787
I mean, Prabhu Tiwari
as a person is...

752
01:01:52,022 --> 01:01:53,216
He's nice.

753
01:01:53,323 --> 01:01:55,553
So, shall we start? - Yes, please.

754
01:01:56,226 --> 01:01:56,988
Ready?

755
01:01:57,093 --> 01:01:58,185
No problem.

756
01:02:03,733 --> 01:02:05,758
Are you sensitive? - What?

757
01:02:05,969 --> 01:02:10,906
I mean feelings, emotions?
- Sensitive?

758
01:02:11,007 --> 01:02:12,201
Sensitive.

759
01:02:12,709 --> 01:02:16,236
Yes. I am a sensitive man.

760
01:02:20,650 --> 01:02:23,175
So, what is Prabhu Tiwari?

761
01:02:24,988 --> 01:02:29,516
Suppose, we need to describe
him in one word. - Yeah.

762
01:02:29,759 --> 01:02:31,226
So what example will you give?

763
01:02:34,631 --> 01:02:35,757
An honest man.

764
01:02:35,865 --> 01:02:38,026
No, no human.
Compare yourself to something.

765
01:02:38,268 --> 01:02:42,204
Something like Prabhu
Tiwari is like water. - Yeah.

766
01:02:42,305 --> 01:02:44,102
Calm.

767
01:02:44,941 --> 01:02:46,135
Or he's like fire.

768
01:02:46,242 --> 01:02:47,300
Or like a cycle.

769
01:02:47,577 --> 01:02:48,737
Cycle?

770
01:02:49,045 --> 01:02:50,740
It keeps running without fuel.

771
01:02:50,847 --> 01:02:52,314
More output, less expensive.

772
01:02:53,216 --> 01:02:57,118
Then Prabhu Tiwari... is an ox!

773
01:02:57,220 --> 01:03:00,246
Ox? - A hard working ox!

774
01:03:03,026 --> 01:03:04,118
Ox!

775
01:03:06,563 --> 01:03:08,224
That can have other meanings, sir.

776
01:03:08,765 --> 01:03:09,754
What?

777
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:11,565
You're not smart.

778
01:03:11,701 --> 01:03:12,793
Then forget it.

779
01:03:12,936 --> 01:03:15,131
Your next question please.

780
01:03:15,238 --> 01:03:17,900
Allow me... - Just delete it.

781
01:03:18,007 --> 01:03:20,669
Say that you're a tomato. - Tomato?

782
01:03:20,777 --> 01:03:22,108
It looks nice.

783
01:03:22,212 --> 01:03:25,545
Use it in pickles,
or in food, eat it raw, it's healthy.

784
01:03:25,648 --> 01:03:26,740
Everyone eats it.

785
01:03:27,784 --> 01:03:31,220
It does have a lot of variety?
- Yes. Of course.

786
01:03:31,488 --> 01:03:33,080
Mr. Inder, excuse me.

787
01:03:33,189 --> 01:03:35,123
That makes two. - Two tomatoes?

788
01:03:35,225 --> 01:03:38,661
No. One is sensitive.

789
01:03:39,529 --> 01:03:41,929
And the second is tomato.

790
01:03:42,031 --> 01:03:43,862
Yes, right. Okay.

791
01:03:44,501 --> 01:03:46,992
This is Indrajeet speaking, and...

792
01:03:47,270 --> 01:03:50,000
...Prabhu Tiwari is a very,
very sensitive tomato...

793
01:03:50,540 --> 01:03:52,235
So, sir. Do you like reading?

794
01:03:52,509 --> 01:03:53,498
Reading? - Yes.

795
01:03:53,610 --> 01:03:56,272
I like reading a lot.

796
01:03:57,247 --> 01:04:00,512
In fact...
I've read more autobiographies.

797
01:04:00,617 --> 01:04:03,017
Pundit Nehru. Gandhiji.

798
01:04:03,119 --> 01:04:05,610
What are human values? - What?

799
01:04:05,788 --> 01:04:07,722
Human values. - I see.

800
01:04:07,824 --> 01:04:10,258
You know, human.

801
01:04:12,028 --> 01:04:13,723
First, know the people...

802
01:04:13,830 --> 01:04:15,457
...then become their leader.

803
01:04:15,732 --> 01:04:18,701
You can dream about
the moon later...

804
01:04:18,801 --> 01:04:20,996
...first learn to live on earth.

805
01:04:21,104 --> 01:04:22,093
Wow.

806
01:04:22,205 --> 01:04:24,799
Just a second. Let me write it down.

807
01:04:25,275 --> 01:04:27,971
I always write these things down.

808
01:04:33,016 --> 01:04:34,108
Excuse me.

809
01:04:36,186 --> 01:04:39,781
The laptop...

810
01:04:39,923 --> 01:04:42,050
What... is it? - Please don't bother,
please, please.

811
01:04:42,158 --> 01:04:44,820
The door's opened too.

812
01:04:49,232 --> 01:04:50,824
Ramcharan!

813
01:04:53,169 --> 01:04:54,727
Do you know how to turn this off,
Mr. Inder?

814
01:04:54,837 --> 01:04:56,998
I'll try. - Please. Please.

815
01:04:57,106 --> 01:04:58,164
Who touched my laptop?

816
01:04:58,274 --> 01:05:01,209
Who touched my laptop?
- Just a minute.

817
01:05:11,588 --> 01:05:14,955
Mr. Inder,
you've seen such a vile thing...

818
01:05:15,058 --> 01:05:16,218
But, please don't
forget to mention...

819
01:05:16,492 --> 01:05:18,722
...that I am a honest man.

820
01:05:19,596 --> 01:05:24,124
Would... you...
like a cold drink? - Yes...

821
01:05:24,734 --> 01:05:25,723
Let it be. - No...

822
01:05:25,835 --> 01:05:26,995
Let it be. - Pande...

823
01:05:27,103 --> 01:05:28,092
Sir, don't bother.

824
01:05:28,204 --> 01:05:29,831
Send two cold drinks...
- Let it be...

825
01:05:29,973 --> 01:05:31,804
Immediately!

826
01:05:32,542 --> 01:05:34,635
That's not done.

827
01:05:35,612 --> 01:05:37,204
What other hobbies do you like?

828
01:05:37,714 --> 01:05:40,274
Nothing much.

829
01:05:40,617 --> 01:05:41,948
Do you every cry?

830
01:05:42,218 --> 01:05:46,484
It's my... humble request.

831
01:05:46,589 --> 01:05:48,716
Don't mention these things, please.

832
01:05:48,825 --> 01:05:50,156
It's not for the interview.

833
01:05:50,260 --> 01:05:52,251
I meant,
bad days are around the corner.

834
01:05:52,528 --> 01:05:54,018
I've heard that the
Chief Minister's changing.

835
01:05:54,297 --> 01:05:56,925
He's facing difficulties
dividing the states.

836
01:05:58,067 --> 01:05:59,261
Who told you that?

837
01:05:59,535 --> 01:06:01,435
The CM's not being changed.

838
01:06:01,604 --> 01:06:03,731
Those four MLAs, the four kings.

839
01:06:04,073 --> 01:06:05,472
They aren't agreeing.

840
01:06:06,509 --> 01:06:08,602
Aditya Pratap Singh's stopping them.

841
01:06:08,911 --> 01:06:10,776
You seem to have
a lot of information.

842
01:06:11,014 --> 01:06:12,003
How do you know?

843
01:06:12,215 --> 01:06:14,183
I am a reporter, sir. Journalist.

844
01:06:14,450 --> 01:06:17,442
I know in which direction
the wind is blowing, and how?

845
01:06:17,553 --> 01:06:18,884
Tell me something else.

846
01:06:22,525 --> 01:06:24,220
How about I fix
a meeting with Madhvi?

847
01:06:24,494 --> 01:06:26,621
What good will that do?

848
01:06:27,030 --> 01:06:28,258
We need Saheb's approval.

849
01:06:28,531 --> 01:06:30,726
Madhvi doesn't listen to Saheb now.

850
01:06:31,801 --> 01:06:33,735
I will make Madhvi join your party...

851
01:06:33,836 --> 01:06:35,929
...and you give her some small post.

852
01:06:36,172 --> 01:06:39,164
Something like a Welfare program.

853
01:06:40,476 --> 01:06:42,706
Mr. Indrajeet. - Yes.

854
01:06:43,479 --> 01:06:48,143
Did you play this adult film?

855
01:06:57,660 --> 01:07:00,720
Independent MLA candidate
Madhvi Singh from Devgarh...

856
01:07:00,863 --> 01:07:06,529
...was appointed President
of 'Women's Welfare Program'.

857
01:07:32,729 --> 01:07:38,133
It's just cheat, lies and deceit.

858
01:07:40,136 --> 01:07:42,627
It's a place for selfishness.
- I take your leave.

859
01:07:42,739 --> 01:07:45,606
I only compromised for Ranjana.

860
01:07:46,075 --> 01:07:47,167
That's all.

861
01:07:47,710 --> 01:07:49,803
Revenge is bloody.

862
01:07:49,912 --> 01:07:53,575
Greed, desires, lust, anger.

863
01:07:55,151 --> 01:07:57,176
Revenge is bloody.

864
01:07:57,286 --> 01:08:00,915
Greed, desires, lust, anger.

865
01:08:02,658 --> 01:08:04,592
Every culprit's innocent.

866
01:08:04,694 --> 01:08:07,686
There's anger in love.

867
01:08:10,032 --> 01:08:11,897
Even the dead are restless.

868
01:08:12,001 --> 01:08:15,732
Jealousy's your only strength.

869
01:08:40,096 --> 01:08:41,757
Who was he?

870
01:08:41,864 --> 01:08:43,798
The Prince of Jagdalpur.

871
01:08:44,534 --> 01:08:47,594
I have just barged in.
I am climbing up your stairs.

872
01:08:52,241 --> 01:08:53,731
The colours of the walls are fine.

873
01:08:53,843 --> 01:08:55,834
We'll need some curtains.

874
01:08:55,945 --> 01:08:57,537
Yes, change them.

875
01:09:53,970 --> 01:09:55,767
Princess?

876
01:09:58,007 --> 01:09:59,941
Your fragrance...

877
01:10:02,712 --> 01:10:03,974
How are you?

878
01:10:08,184 --> 01:10:09,617
Just...

879
01:10:11,721 --> 01:10:13,052
Can't sleep.

880
01:10:16,759 --> 01:10:18,192
Let me help you.

881
01:10:30,907 --> 01:10:31,999
How does this open?

882
01:10:36,546 --> 01:10:39,743
Where does it open from?

883
01:10:42,084 --> 01:10:43,210
Take a look.

884
01:10:55,998 --> 01:10:58,626
Will I have to tear it? - No.

885
01:11:22,291 --> 01:11:24,816
Hold on for five seconds,
you can do it, sir.

886
01:11:25,861 --> 01:11:27,886
Bravo. You can do it, sir.

887
01:11:34,036 --> 01:11:35,970
My father-in-law's father.

888
01:11:36,639 --> 01:11:39,130
Back in those days he
owned an air-strip. - Okay.

889
01:11:39,241 --> 01:11:40,902
Two planes. - Right.

890
01:11:41,010 --> 01:11:42,807
He never got along with the British.

891
01:11:43,045 --> 01:11:45,206
But he completed his
entire education in England.

892
01:11:45,314 --> 01:11:46,679
Wonderful.

893
01:11:47,183 --> 01:11:49,617
This is our ancestral sword. - Wow!

894
01:11:49,752 --> 01:11:51,014
Hemangi. - Yes.

895
01:11:51,220 --> 01:11:52,915
Come on.

896
01:11:54,824 --> 01:11:57,622
Ma'am, tell us something
about your cuisine.

897
01:11:58,060 --> 01:12:01,257
How was it before
and what is the change?

898
01:12:01,731 --> 01:12:03,494
Back then we had a lot of people.

899
01:12:03,599 --> 01:12:05,726
We always had some guest over.

900
01:12:05,968 --> 01:12:08,630
Parties. Servants and maids.

901
01:12:09,171 --> 01:12:12,629
Today, we cook as much
as any normal family.

902
01:12:13,109 --> 01:12:15,737
But, there are few
recipes we still make.

903
01:12:16,779 --> 01:12:17,746
Excuse me.

904
01:12:17,847 --> 01:12:20,509
Good afternoon, Your Highness.

905
01:12:20,750 --> 01:12:22,149
I want you to leave.

906
01:12:22,585 --> 01:12:24,815
This... this won't take
more than half an hour, sir.

907
01:12:24,920 --> 01:12:27,013
Seriously. Come on.

908
01:12:27,657 --> 01:12:30,125
Hey you, camera. Please.

909
01:12:30,226 --> 01:12:33,525
They're just asking normal questions,
nothing political.

910
01:12:33,629 --> 01:12:34,561
What were you showing them?

911
01:12:34,664 --> 01:12:35,631
What we were...

912
01:12:35,731 --> 01:12:37,221
There are just a handful of us.

913
01:12:38,267 --> 01:12:40,963
Take a picture,
we might go extinct someday.

914
01:12:42,238 --> 01:12:45,901
We're still alive.
We haven't perished away.

915
01:12:47,009 --> 01:12:48,738
We've a history.

916
01:12:48,844 --> 01:12:50,971
And we'll keep making history.

917
01:12:51,781 --> 01:12:54,181
This is my home, not a bloody museum!

918
01:13:25,748 --> 01:13:27,238
Take your gun out.

919
01:13:28,184 --> 01:13:29,481
Here?

920
01:13:30,152 --> 01:13:31,642
We'll venerate him.

921
01:13:37,126 --> 01:13:38,593
Cap.

922
01:13:54,243 --> 01:13:55,574
No...

923
01:13:55,945 --> 01:13:57,572
No, brother.

924
01:13:57,680 --> 01:14:00,012
You've already anointed
him with your blood.

925
01:14:00,149 --> 01:14:01,776
There's no need for this.
- Look here.

926
01:14:02,585 --> 01:14:04,212
Grandpa's watching.

927
01:14:04,487 --> 01:14:05,249
You already...

928
01:14:05,521 --> 01:14:06,852
It'll hurt...

929
01:14:07,022 --> 01:14:08,148
What are you doing, Param?

930
01:14:08,257 --> 01:14:09,656
Just a small one.

931
01:14:09,759 --> 01:14:12,193
It's hurting...
- Grandpa's asking for sacrifice.

932
01:14:12,528 --> 01:14:13,995
It's hurting. - Let go.

933
01:14:14,130 --> 01:14:15,961
Slowly. Slowly!

934
01:14:53,135 --> 01:14:55,000
Chetia. Chetia. Chetia.

935
01:14:55,137 --> 01:14:56,195
Call for you.

936
01:14:56,806 --> 01:14:58,000
Hello.

937
01:15:01,710 --> 01:15:04,804
UP 17 X 3851.

938
01:15:29,038 --> 01:15:30,096
Get down.

939
01:15:37,913 --> 01:15:38,971
Get back.

940
01:15:42,484 --> 01:15:44,145
Hold him. Hold him.

941
01:15:44,820 --> 01:15:45,809
Bullets.

942
01:15:45,921 --> 01:15:47,582
Hold him. Hold him.

943
01:15:47,723 --> 01:15:48,747
They were in my pockets.

944
01:15:48,858 --> 01:15:50,155
Found it.

945
01:15:54,263 --> 01:15:56,663
Got him! - I hit him first.

946
01:15:58,033 --> 01:15:59,591
Brother!

947
01:16:00,836 --> 01:16:02,201
The pain!

948
01:16:06,141 --> 01:16:07,608
That's not him.

949
01:16:07,710 --> 01:16:08,768
It's not him.

950
01:16:09,545 --> 01:16:11,536
He's not the one in Ranjana's photo.

951
01:16:11,680 --> 01:16:12,908
How can that be?

952
01:16:15,818 --> 01:16:17,945
Madhvi's going with you. - Yes.

953
01:16:19,121 --> 01:16:21,180
Mr. Saxena is royal blood.

954
01:16:21,690 --> 01:16:24,557
His father was the Principal
Secretary, Madhya Pradesh.

955
01:16:24,693 --> 01:16:25,682
Yes,

956
01:16:25,794 --> 01:16:27,921
Often money's not their weakness.

957
01:16:35,771 --> 01:16:37,136
Return it to her. - Yes.

958
01:16:37,239 --> 01:16:40,868
The highway's become
dangerous these days. - Yes.

959
01:16:40,976 --> 01:16:42,807
You carry a weapon, too. Show me.

960
01:16:42,912 --> 01:16:46,507
I do, but never use it.

961
01:16:46,916 --> 01:16:47,780
Here.

962
01:16:47,883 --> 01:16:50,113
Hand it here, Mr. Jaiswal. - Here.

963
01:16:50,219 --> 01:16:53,882
This can take your life,
don't treat it like a bride.

964
01:16:53,989 --> 01:16:56,651
Where you seduce her for two hours,
and the rest in two minutes.

965
01:16:56,759 --> 01:16:59,489
This is how you use it...

966
01:17:00,763 --> 01:17:03,698
Careful, the bride will die.

967
01:17:05,868 --> 01:17:06,732
Sit down.

968
01:17:06,835 --> 01:17:07,824
Sit here.

969
01:17:08,537 --> 01:17:11,700
Ranjana says she's going back. - Yes.

970
01:17:11,807 --> 01:17:13,434
She's bored here.

971
01:17:13,542 --> 01:17:15,737
She has read all the all the books...
- Please leave.

972
01:17:16,178 --> 01:17:17,668
You will be late for the meeting.

973
01:17:17,780 --> 01:17:19,748
I am travelling out of the city.

974
01:17:19,848 --> 01:17:22,146
If I could have my gun back.

975
01:17:22,584 --> 01:17:24,518
I was about to give it back.

976
01:17:28,991 --> 01:17:31,118
No need to be scared now.

977
01:17:31,226 --> 01:17:32,784
I'm always scared.

978
01:17:32,895 --> 01:17:35,728
What if the gun
turns brazen like you?

979
01:17:37,833 --> 01:17:40,961
And fires on anyone, anywhere.

980
01:17:41,637 --> 01:17:43,969
Please excuse me,
I'm waiting outside.

981
01:17:45,741 --> 01:17:48,141
Now you humiliate me
in front of strangers as well.

982
01:17:49,144 --> 01:17:53,137
Every time I look at you,
I feel like misbehaving.

983
01:17:56,051 --> 01:17:58,576
Don't talk too much in the meeting,

984
01:17:59,788 --> 01:18:01,551
Just smile a few times.

985
01:18:01,890 --> 01:18:03,949
And no drinking.

986
01:18:05,828 --> 01:18:07,796
Master, Vasant's here.

987
01:18:11,734 --> 01:18:14,931
Don't treat her like
that in my presence.

988
01:18:15,070 --> 01:18:18,506
I didn't say all that to please you.

989
01:18:19,508 --> 01:18:22,204
Do you know why men
use more abusive language?

990
01:18:23,746 --> 01:18:25,680
Because they don't cry much.

991
01:18:27,683 --> 01:18:29,446
I'll be back in a while.

992
01:18:37,993 --> 01:18:39,460
Stay quiet.

993
01:18:39,995 --> 01:18:41,019
Saheb.

994
01:18:44,500 --> 01:18:46,627
They killed four of our men.

995
01:18:47,870 --> 01:18:51,033
And Chetia's... missing.

996
01:18:51,573 --> 01:18:52,801
So, why come here?

997
01:18:52,908 --> 01:18:54,876
The police isn't behind this.

998
01:18:55,978 --> 01:18:58,572
Has it fired from the rifle?

999
01:18:59,815 --> 01:19:01,783
It's someone else, Saheb.

1000
01:19:03,218 --> 01:19:04,776
Don't come here for a few days.

1001
01:19:04,887 --> 01:19:06,445
I will call you.

1002
01:19:07,556 --> 01:19:09,080
And stay low, understand

1003
01:19:09,658 --> 01:19:10,420
Yes, Saheb.

1004
01:19:14,963 --> 01:19:16,897
Look after yourself.

1005
01:19:17,699 --> 01:19:18,723
Yes.

1006
01:19:30,446 --> 01:19:31,970
Madam...

1007
01:19:32,548 --> 01:19:34,914
Have you ever met the Secretary?

1008
01:19:35,184 --> 01:19:37,482
No. Never.

1009
01:19:41,557 --> 01:19:44,151
I've heard that he's a difficult man.

1010
01:19:49,631 --> 01:19:50,825
Madam, excuse me.

1011
01:19:50,933 --> 01:19:53,265
You better not drink today. Please.

1012
01:19:53,535 --> 01:19:55,196
You just said he's a difficult man.

1013
01:19:56,038 --> 01:19:57,505
So, I'll have to act difficult too.

1014
01:19:58,072 --> 01:20:01,007
Mr. Jaiswal, this project
is important for the government.

1015
01:20:01,109 --> 01:20:03,669
This bridge will
benefit four districts.

1016
01:20:03,778 --> 01:20:05,871
Sir, we've studied the project.

1017
01:20:06,447 --> 01:20:08,108
Now, you guide us.

1018
01:20:08,382 --> 01:20:12,375
The forest department's
involved in this.

1019
01:20:12,487 --> 01:20:13,977
Waterworks too.

1020
01:20:14,088 --> 01:20:17,319
They'll all give preference
to their candidates.

1021
01:20:17,425 --> 01:20:18,449
There will be a tender.

1022
01:20:18,559 --> 01:20:19,753
You can fill that too.

1023
01:20:19,961 --> 01:20:21,326
Madam, sugar?

1024
01:20:22,130 --> 01:20:23,961
As much as you like.

1025
01:20:24,365 --> 01:20:25,354
What?

1026
01:20:25,466 --> 01:20:27,559
When things aren't our way...

1027
01:20:27,869 --> 01:20:30,429
Then, why don't you add
sugar as much as you want.

1028
01:20:33,674 --> 01:20:35,869
Whether you get the tender or not...

1029
01:20:38,746 --> 01:20:40,907
...but you will surely
get a good cup of tea.

1030
01:20:42,984 --> 01:20:45,452
I've heard a lot about you.

1031
01:20:45,953 --> 01:20:46,885
Mr. Jaiswal.

1032
01:20:46,988 --> 01:20:47,977
Yes, madam.

1033
01:20:49,457 --> 01:20:50,446
Will you please leave us alone?

1034
01:20:50,591 --> 01:20:51,421
Yes.

1035
01:20:51,526 --> 01:20:52,515
Okay, sir.

1036
01:21:05,573 --> 01:21:06,767
Perfect.

1037
01:21:08,442 --> 01:21:09,602
Shalini.

1038
01:21:10,378 --> 01:21:12,608
Please go out.

1039
01:21:20,855 --> 01:21:23,119
Just arrange for the money.

1040
01:21:23,391 --> 01:21:24,380
And soon.

1041
01:21:24,492 --> 01:21:25,925
Consider it done.

1042
01:21:26,027 --> 01:21:28,552
I never waste time.

1043
01:21:28,729 --> 01:21:30,697
Driver, let's go.

1044
01:21:33,734 --> 01:21:35,361
Madam, how was the meeting?

1045
01:21:35,469 --> 01:21:36,629
I've requested him.

1046
01:21:36,737 --> 01:21:37,897
Let's wait and watch.

1047
01:21:38,005 --> 01:21:40,838
You've requested him,
he'll definitely say yes.

1048
01:21:41,576 --> 01:21:43,373
I've to go somewhere, alone.

1049
01:21:43,477 --> 01:21:44,603
Where can I drop you?

1050
01:22:16,711 --> 01:22:18,645
Drink? - Now?

1051
01:22:18,746 --> 01:22:20,577
I never drink during the day.

1052
01:22:22,049 --> 01:22:24,609
People like you give
a bad name to nights.

1053
01:22:26,821 --> 01:22:28,846
I'm busy during the day.

1054
01:22:29,657 --> 01:22:31,682
So, did you do it?

1055
01:22:34,328 --> 01:22:35,818
It's done. - Done?

1056
01:22:36,097 --> 01:22:37,689
You will get the tender.

1057
01:22:38,032 --> 01:22:39,863
Wow!

1058
01:22:41,669 --> 01:22:42,567
Thank you.

1059
01:22:42,703 --> 01:22:44,762
Thank you very much.

1060
01:22:46,007 --> 01:22:47,440
Thank you.

1061
01:22:48,909 --> 01:22:52,470
You look different.

1062
01:22:52,847 --> 01:22:54,109
It's just...

1063
01:22:54,382 --> 01:22:55,815
I got this stitched in Lucknow.

1064
01:22:55,916 --> 01:22:58,009
I found a decent tailor in Lucknow.

1065
01:22:58,419 --> 01:23:01,877
Like they say God made men,
and the tailor made gentlemen.

1066
01:23:03,591 --> 01:23:06,025
You wish to be a king too.

1067
01:23:08,729 --> 01:23:11,527
No, Madhvi, I am.

1068
01:23:14,568 --> 01:23:16,866
I thought I would tell
you this on a better occasion.

1069
01:23:16,971 --> 01:23:18,529
So, today is the time.

1070
01:23:19,106 --> 01:23:24,703
The ruins near the river
in your area used to be our fort.

1071
01:23:27,014 --> 01:23:30,541
Saheb's ancestors
decimated my entire family.

1072
01:23:31,552 --> 01:23:34,817
Only one boy survived,
who continued the lineage.

1073
01:23:35,923 --> 01:23:37,788
It's been three generations...

1074
01:23:38,626 --> 01:23:41,789
...but, no one ever thought
of winning that fort back.

1075
01:23:44,098 --> 01:23:46,828
I wonder why these thoughts...

1076
01:23:47,568 --> 01:23:49,832
...have been troubling
me since my childhood days.

1077
01:23:50,705 --> 01:23:53,105
Do you have anything else to say?

1078
01:23:54,475 --> 01:23:55,874
Anything else?

1079
01:23:56,777 --> 01:23:59,575
Madhvi, I was just trying to tell
you the truth that's in my heart...

1080
01:23:59,714 --> 01:24:02,581
No. You've a sharp mind.

1081
01:24:02,683 --> 01:24:04,776
Very sharp.

1082
01:24:05,419 --> 01:24:07,410
You're... getting angry...

1083
01:24:15,529 --> 01:24:17,895
I've no friends.

1084
01:24:18,733 --> 01:24:20,462
Not a single one.

1085
01:24:20,568 --> 01:24:23,935
Don't say that. You've me.

1086
01:24:25,306 --> 01:24:27,604
You'll see me in the tears...

1087
01:24:27,708 --> 01:24:29,437
I mean, in your tears.

1088
01:24:30,845 --> 01:24:34,645
For you, I hold no value.

1089
01:24:34,949 --> 01:24:36,712
But soon you will yearn for me.

1090
01:24:37,718 --> 01:24:39,879
See, I turned a poet for you.

1091
01:24:48,729 --> 01:24:51,061
So, when will you be a man?

1092
01:24:52,666 --> 01:24:54,429
Whenever you want?

1093
01:24:55,336 --> 01:24:57,031
Just give the orders.

1094
01:24:57,505 --> 01:24:59,473
Who do you want to kill?

1095
01:25:00,674 --> 01:25:03,006
We will help each other.

1096
01:25:06,814 --> 01:25:10,511
But it'll be my decision
to end this war.

1097
01:25:12,353 --> 01:25:14,753
I want to finish Saheb's power.

1098
01:25:15,589 --> 01:25:18,353
But he should be unharmed.

1099
01:25:25,399 --> 01:25:27,697
I'm not concerned about his health.

1100
01:25:28,469 --> 01:25:30,869
When I've his power.

1101
01:25:33,040 --> 01:25:36,669
Every time you look at me,
do you feel love?

1102
01:25:37,912 --> 01:25:39,106
Yes.

1103
01:25:39,380 --> 01:25:41,678
Every word you say casts a spell.

1104
01:25:41,782 --> 01:25:42,806
Yes.

1105
01:25:43,484 --> 01:25:46,078
See, you're lying.

1106
01:25:46,520 --> 01:25:48,784
But I trust you.

1107
01:28:23,476 --> 01:28:26,240
Come on.

1108
01:29:14,160 --> 01:29:16,628
He thrashed me severely, brother.

1109
01:29:16,729 --> 01:29:20,187
Made me drink chilly water.

1110
01:29:20,400 --> 01:29:22,265
Don't spare him.

1111
01:29:22,468 --> 01:29:24,493
Don't spare him.

1112
01:29:24,871 --> 01:29:26,839
Don't spare him.

1113
01:29:30,877 --> 01:29:32,538
Don't spare him.

1114
01:29:33,212 --> 01:29:36,511
Don't spare him.

1115
01:29:36,649 --> 01:29:38,241
Throw them in.

1116
01:29:38,851 --> 01:29:41,149
I'll tell you where to go.

1117
01:29:44,324 --> 01:29:47,191
He beats really cruelly.

1118
01:29:47,427 --> 01:29:48,325
Come here.

1119
01:29:48,428 --> 01:29:50,157
Brother! - Shut up!

1120
01:29:51,898 --> 01:29:53,695
Come here. I won't hurt you,
I just want to talk.

1121
01:29:53,833 --> 01:29:55,266
Come on.

1122
01:29:56,402 --> 01:29:58,563
He won't spare you. - Sit. Sit.

1123
01:29:58,671 --> 01:30:00,571
No, brother. - Shut up.

1124
01:30:02,475 --> 01:30:04,306
I won't beat you.
I just want to talk.

1125
01:30:04,510 --> 01:30:07,172
Look, I can kill you right now.

1126
01:30:07,513 --> 01:30:08,707
You will die.

1127
01:30:09,482 --> 01:30:13,646
Speak up, and you could be spared.

1128
01:30:14,053 --> 01:30:15,247
Get it.

1129
01:30:15,755 --> 01:30:20,351
No. No, brother.

1130
01:30:21,127 --> 01:30:23,425
No.

1131
01:30:26,232 --> 01:30:27,824
Kill him.

1132
01:30:35,274 --> 01:30:38,209
That's been taken care of. Okay.

1133
01:30:39,245 --> 01:30:40,576
He was a traitor.

1134
01:30:40,813 --> 01:30:42,303
He had to die.

1135
01:30:42,415 --> 01:30:48,251
But, the one you're
asking me to betray...

1136
01:30:50,289 --> 01:30:51,847
...will never spare us alive.

1137
01:30:52,191 --> 01:30:53,215
Listen.

1138
01:30:54,127 --> 01:30:57,460
This is a serious matter.
Don't make it confusing.

1139
01:30:58,197 --> 01:30:59,721
Everyone has to die.

1140
01:31:00,233 --> 01:31:02,793
You can die today,
or maybe live for a day or two.

1141
01:31:03,202 --> 01:31:04,760
Wait until the next elections.

1142
01:31:05,138 --> 01:31:06,833
Or the next Shahrukh Khan movie.

1143
01:31:07,106 --> 01:31:08,437
There's nothing wrong.

1144
01:31:09,642 --> 01:31:10,609
Who informed you that...

1145
01:31:10,710 --> 01:31:12,735
...the highway gangs
are being brought here?

1146
01:31:12,845 --> 01:31:14,142
We don't know anything.

1147
01:31:14,247 --> 01:31:16,613
Sir, it must be the one
who's bringing those dacoits here.

1148
01:31:16,716 --> 01:31:18,183
We'll wait a while and see.

1149
01:31:18,284 --> 01:31:19,649
Bring them, but who?

1150
01:31:28,294 --> 01:31:29,283
Sir.

1151
01:31:30,463 --> 01:31:31,430
What...

1152
01:31:31,764 --> 01:31:34,062
What's going on? Media?

1153
01:31:34,167 --> 01:31:35,691
Just a minute, sir.

1154
01:31:36,803 --> 01:31:38,430
They'll testify in
front of the media...

1155
01:31:38,538 --> 01:31:40,199
...and it will become public.

1156
01:31:40,306 --> 01:31:42,399
No one will call
you to set them free.

1157
01:31:42,575 --> 01:31:46,204
But... who gave you
permission to do all this?

1158
01:31:46,412 --> 01:31:47,504
Sir, I didn't have the permission...

1159
01:31:47,647 --> 01:31:49,547
...but, I did the right thing.

1160
01:31:50,817 --> 01:31:52,546
You can get your picture taken.

1161
01:31:52,652 --> 01:31:55,416
Chauhan, bring them out.

1162
01:31:55,721 --> 01:31:59,282
Sir, let us talk to them...
- Stay back!

1163
01:31:59,425 --> 01:32:01,222
Back. Back. Move back.

1164
01:32:01,327 --> 01:32:03,488
They are criminals, not politicians.
Stay back.

1165
01:32:03,596 --> 01:32:05,154
Maintain distance.

1166
01:32:05,264 --> 01:32:07,232
Someone wants to talk to you.

1167
01:32:08,367 --> 01:32:08,833
Just because you're from
a well-known newspaper...

1168
01:32:09,102 --> 01:32:10,228
...doesn't mean you do as you please.

1169
01:32:10,369 --> 01:32:12,599
Sir's right here,
there's a protocol to be followed.

1170
01:32:12,705 --> 01:32:15,299
Sir. - Yes, go ahead.

1171
01:32:15,408 --> 01:32:17,672
How long have you been
committing these loots?

1172
01:32:20,379 --> 01:32:22,142
For the past two-three years.

1173
01:32:23,649 --> 01:32:25,583
Ask him who he works for?

1174
01:32:25,785 --> 01:32:29,084
So, who do you work for?

1175
01:32:34,327 --> 01:32:37,353
Kanhaiyya, he's our chief.

1176
01:32:38,397 --> 01:32:41,628
Kanhaiyya... Saheb...

1177
01:33:14,600 --> 01:33:17,068
Are you here to arrest Kanhaiyya?

1178
01:33:17,170 --> 01:33:19,365
Vasant's given a false statement.

1179
01:33:20,373 --> 01:33:22,238
You were supposed to get arrested...

1180
01:33:22,441 --> 01:33:24,705
...but, he took
Kanhaiyya's name instead.

1181
01:33:27,146 --> 01:33:28,545
Sir, here's the death certificate.

1182
01:33:28,681 --> 01:33:30,615
You can take the
dead body for cremation.

1183
01:33:30,716 --> 01:33:32,149
Show me.

1184
01:33:43,196 --> 01:33:44,424
Wait.

1185
01:33:46,265 --> 01:33:47,232
How did he die?

1186
01:33:47,333 --> 01:33:48,766
Shocked.

1187
01:33:51,170 --> 01:33:54,071
He couldn't tolerate
this humiliation.

1188
01:33:55,274 --> 01:33:57,174
And he died of shock.

1189
01:34:00,079 --> 01:34:02,513
I know it all.

1190
01:34:02,882 --> 01:34:04,816
You're the real chief.

1191
01:34:05,418 --> 01:34:07,215
He was just a soldier.

1192
01:34:07,587 --> 01:34:09,179
You're a soldier too.

1193
01:34:09,522 --> 01:34:11,581
So, who is your chief?

1194
01:34:12,325 --> 01:34:13,690
Just tell me.

1195
01:34:14,126 --> 01:34:16,617
You won't like to hear it.

1196
01:34:17,396 --> 01:34:20,422
You won't be able to
endure two shocks in one day.

1197
01:34:36,349 --> 01:34:38,715
Hello. - Can we talk?

1198
01:34:39,085 --> 01:34:40,677
Yes.

1199
01:34:41,520 --> 01:34:43,215
I can't say it over the phone.

1200
01:34:44,724 --> 01:34:46,248
Can you come over here?

1201
01:34:47,393 --> 01:34:49,691
So suddenly? - It's urgent.

1202
01:34:50,529 --> 01:34:54,090
Fine. Tomorrow then. - Make it today.

1203
01:34:54,867 --> 01:34:56,334
I'll have to pack.

1204
01:34:56,435 --> 01:34:58,460
Pack only for day.

1205
01:34:59,071 --> 01:35:00,402
And come today.

1206
01:35:03,676 --> 01:35:05,166
Jagdish.

1207
01:35:07,880 --> 01:35:09,211
Jagdish!

1208
01:35:09,382 --> 01:35:10,474
Yes... Yes Saheb.

1209
01:35:11,117 --> 01:35:12,175
That's been done, madam.

1210
01:35:12,285 --> 01:35:14,651
And the new file's been passed...
- Madam.

1211
01:35:14,754 --> 01:35:16,346
Madam, our application...

1212
01:35:22,595 --> 01:35:23,687
Pass me the N65.

1213
01:35:31,070 --> 01:35:32,367
Turn the phone on, sir.

1214
01:35:39,078 --> 01:35:40,568
Stop that car at the left.

1215
01:35:46,319 --> 01:35:47,581
I'll be right back.

1216
01:36:48,147 --> 01:36:48,738
Hello.

1217
01:36:48,848 --> 01:36:51,248
I've been calling you for two hours.

1218
01:36:51,350 --> 01:36:52,339
My phone was switched off.

1219
01:36:52,451 --> 01:36:53,475
It wasn't working,
so I gave it for repairing.

1220
01:36:53,619 --> 01:36:54,711
I just got it back.

1221
01:36:58,424 --> 01:37:00,688
Look, I've been called to Devgarh.
- Devgarh?

1222
01:37:00,793 --> 01:37:01,919
Yes.

1223
01:37:02,328 --> 01:37:03,317
So suddenly?

1224
01:37:04,563 --> 01:37:05,587
For how long?

1225
01:37:05,698 --> 01:37:07,563
I was asked to pack only for a day.

1226
01:37:07,666 --> 01:37:09,190
One day? - Yes.

1227
01:37:11,103 --> 01:37:12,502
Greetings, Her Highness.

1228
01:37:13,873 --> 01:37:14,635
What brings you here?

1229
01:37:14,740 --> 01:37:16,367
I'm counting the trees in this area.

1230
01:37:16,642 --> 01:37:18,542
My car's broken down, give it a push.

1231
01:37:19,678 --> 01:37:20,804
Come on.

1232
01:37:23,516 --> 01:37:25,450
Something doesn't feel right.

1233
01:37:30,289 --> 01:37:32,223
Is Saheb planning the wedding?

1234
01:37:32,324 --> 01:37:35,122
I don't know,
just keep your phone on.

1235
01:37:36,195 --> 01:37:38,095
Hello. Hello...

1236
01:37:38,864 --> 01:37:39,796
Hello

1237
01:37:50,242 --> 01:37:52,870
Jagdish, we've guests. - Yes

1238
01:37:53,412 --> 01:37:54,344
Show her to her room...

1239
01:37:54,447 --> 01:37:57,245
...and tell her we'll
meet over breakfast.

1240
01:37:57,483 --> 01:37:58,677
Yes.

1241
01:39:02,348 --> 01:39:04,873
Take me in your arms...

1242
01:39:05,150 --> 01:39:13,854
...this beautiful moment
might not come again.

1243
01:39:14,126 --> 01:39:25,060
Maybe we won't meet
again in this lifetime.

1244
01:39:25,271 --> 01:39:29,537
Take me in your arms...

1245
01:39:45,658 --> 01:39:47,125
Inder.

1246
01:39:47,693 --> 01:39:57,432
I'm fortunate to get these moments.

1247
01:39:59,171 --> 01:40:04,234
Take a good look...

1248
01:40:04,710 --> 01:40:05,904
Inder.

1249
01:40:06,679 --> 01:40:08,169
What are you doing here?

1250
01:40:08,380 --> 01:40:09,711
You...

1251
01:40:10,749 --> 01:40:15,049
I came to see you.

1252
01:40:15,254 --> 01:40:17,552
We couldn't meet this morning.

1253
01:40:18,157 --> 01:40:19,681
So, I thought that
maybe you're angry...

1254
01:40:19,792 --> 01:40:22,590
You... came all the way here!

1255
01:40:23,128 --> 01:40:29,761
Maybe we won't meet
again in this lifetime.

1256
01:40:29,868 --> 01:40:32,860
Where? - Inside?

1257
01:40:33,138 --> 01:40:35,402
Take me in your arms...

1258
01:40:50,356 --> 01:40:54,725
I thought you might be angry,
so I must apologies.

1259
01:40:57,296 --> 01:40:58,388
Take it off.

1260
01:41:00,099 --> 01:41:01,157
What?

1261
01:41:02,334 --> 01:41:06,896
You're here to apologies,
so you'll have to bow down.

1262
01:42:06,665 --> 01:42:09,327
I called you in a hurry.

1263
01:42:10,602 --> 01:42:12,069
I apologies.

1264
01:42:12,471 --> 01:42:14,666
It was no trouble coming here.

1265
01:42:15,274 --> 01:42:16,764
It's just that I
didn't know why, so...

1266
01:42:17,042 --> 01:42:22,412
Your eyes convey that
I troubled you a lot.

1267
01:42:27,419 --> 01:42:29,080
This...

1268
01:42:32,424 --> 01:42:35,825
A gift for you.

1269
01:42:39,264 --> 01:42:43,633
This cannot make up
for the mistakes I made...

1270
01:42:45,504 --> 01:42:48,166
. but, I called you
here to say that...

1271
01:42:51,577 --> 01:42:54,068
...l'm breaking this engagement.

1272
01:42:54,646 --> 01:42:56,841
You cannot always do as you please.

1273
01:42:57,116 --> 01:42:59,516
You cannot break this engagement
as and when you please.

1274
01:43:00,119 --> 01:43:04,112
Since I made this mistake,
everything's going wrong.

1275
01:43:04,289 --> 01:43:05,881
And, I am responsible for it?

1276
01:43:09,528 --> 01:43:12,224
It's in the air here.

1277
01:43:14,666 --> 01:43:18,796
Every good thing gets spoilt.

1278
01:43:22,307 --> 01:43:26,801
There's a conspiracy
behind every relation.

1279
01:43:28,847 --> 01:43:32,476
I don't want you to
be just a lifeless image.

1280
01:43:33,051 --> 01:43:39,149
I... have stolen many glances of you.

1281
01:43:39,625 --> 01:43:41,058
What?

1282
01:44:51,730 --> 01:44:54,062
Hello. - I want to talk to you.

1283
01:44:54,533 --> 01:44:56,398
But, can't do it over the phone.

1284
01:44:56,835 --> 01:44:59,531
Shall I come over, or will you?

1285
01:45:00,706 --> 01:45:02,640
I am coming.

1286
01:45:14,019 --> 01:45:17,477
I... I want to tell you something.

1287
01:45:18,824 --> 01:45:21,019
You have many enemies, Saheb.

1288
01:45:21,627 --> 01:45:24,391
Why are you telling me this?

1289
01:45:26,131 --> 01:45:30,761
Your pictures made me turn a traitor.

1290
01:45:32,671 --> 01:45:34,298
You were right.

1291
01:45:35,040 --> 01:45:36,803
There's something in the air here...

1292
01:45:37,409 --> 01:45:39,604
...that spoils every good thing.

1293
01:45:55,260 --> 01:46:01,221
Every corner... of my heart echoed.

1294
01:46:01,600 --> 01:46:07,505
The moon smiled from the clouds.

1295
01:46:08,840 --> 01:46:14,369
I was betrayed.

1296
01:46:15,347 --> 01:46:20,512
How far have I come?

1297
01:46:20,852 --> 01:46:26,757
Now, I need to stop.

1298
01:46:27,259 --> 01:46:33,391
And fill the void.

1299
01:46:33,632 --> 01:46:39,468
Every corner of my heart echoed.

1300
01:46:39,905 --> 01:46:45,775
The moon smiled from the clouds.

1301
01:46:46,111 --> 01:46:52,414
Why do dreams make me smile?

1302
01:46:52,784 --> 01:46:59,417
Even the nights look pleasant.

1303
01:47:04,396 --> 01:47:06,125
Wow!

1304
01:47:16,274 --> 01:47:17,798
Ranjana.

1305
01:47:18,310 --> 01:47:19,140
How are you?

1306
01:47:19,244 --> 01:47:20,302
All fine.

1307
01:47:20,412 --> 01:47:22,505
Why are you answering in-short?

1308
01:47:23,582 --> 01:47:26,073
Anyone around? - Yes.

1309
01:47:26,184 --> 01:47:27,378
I see.

1310
01:47:27,486 --> 01:47:29,283
Listen.

1311
01:47:29,388 --> 01:47:31,356
Don't worry, Ranjana.

1312
01:47:31,556 --> 01:47:35,151
Just a few more days,
and then its all over.

1313
01:47:36,862 --> 01:47:38,090
Bye.

1314
01:47:38,263 --> 01:47:40,595
Bye, darling.

1315
01:47:46,638 --> 01:47:48,367
What? - Come on!

1316
01:48:06,792 --> 01:48:07,884
Come on, smile now.

1317
01:48:08,126 --> 01:48:09,150
One smile.

1318
01:48:09,594 --> 01:48:12,222
This day will be recorded in history.

1319
01:48:12,330 --> 01:48:14,059
These four independent MLAs'...

1320
01:48:14,166 --> 01:48:18,330
...who were against the division
of the state are now in favor of it.

1321
01:48:18,603 --> 01:48:21,299
And, they've also
joined the CM's party.

1322
01:48:21,406 --> 01:48:23,397
Madhvi Singh's is in
direct collision course...

1323
01:48:23,508 --> 01:48:27,137
...with her husband,
Aditya Pratap Singh.

1324
01:48:27,245 --> 01:48:29,713
And all these
developments indicate...

1325
01:48:30,115 --> 01:48:32,208
...that the division
of the states is certain.

1326
01:48:36,188 --> 01:48:40,181
The question is,
why isn't there any development.

1327
01:48:40,325 --> 01:48:42,725
The reason behind it isn't
just corrupt politicians.

1328
01:48:42,861 --> 01:48:44,226
Population.

1329
01:48:44,362 --> 01:48:48,526
Just like the vast population
is a issue for the country...

1330
01:48:48,733 --> 01:48:55,832
...similarly one state cannot
cater to this huge populace.

1331
01:48:56,374 --> 01:48:58,274
Far sightedness.

1332
01:48:58,510 --> 01:49:01,741
One needs far sightedness
to do this task.

1333
01:49:02,247 --> 01:49:07,184
This state can develop only when...

1334
01:49:07,452 --> 01:49:11,718
...four new states are born.

1335
01:49:12,791 --> 01:49:14,850
Vande Mataram!

1336
01:49:16,595 --> 01:49:18,324
Vande Mataram!

1337
01:49:18,430 --> 01:49:23,094
And, these four MLAs
have proven my point.

1338
01:49:23,735 --> 01:49:24,394
Sunder.

1339
01:49:26,104 --> 01:49:27,298
Jagdish.

1340
01:49:29,074 --> 01:49:30,166
Sunder.

1341
01:49:31,510 --> 01:49:35,207
Her determination, hard work...

1342
01:49:35,347 --> 01:49:37,247
...is appreciated by our government.

1343
01:49:37,649 --> 01:49:38,809
Sunder.

1344
01:49:39,251 --> 01:49:41,310
Don't be scared. I'll help you.

1345
01:49:41,686 --> 01:49:42,812
Where do you want to go?

1346
01:49:43,255 --> 01:49:46,281
You took the gun out.
Did someone scare you?

1347
01:49:46,391 --> 01:49:50,691
I took the gun out long ago,
but you just saw it.

1348
01:49:52,597 --> 01:49:54,326
Have we met before?

1349
01:49:54,699 --> 01:49:55,893
No.

1350
01:49:56,668 --> 01:49:58,659
But I know you.

1351
01:50:01,106 --> 01:50:02,903
I... am Indrajeet Singh.

1352
01:50:03,175 --> 01:50:07,134
You shouldn't have
approached me from the back.

1353
01:50:07,746 --> 01:50:09,680
Firstly, I'm wounded.

1354
01:50:10,315 --> 01:50:13,341
And my enemies have always
attacked me from behind.

1355
01:50:15,053 --> 01:50:16,748
If I had fired...

1356
01:50:17,122 --> 01:50:19,750
A Thakur would've died
at the hands of a Thakur.

1357
01:50:20,725 --> 01:50:22,317
Right.

1358
01:50:24,563 --> 01:50:28,499
Next time, it will face-to-face.

1359
01:50:32,070 --> 01:50:35,233
I know my kin, my family
will be hurt by my decision.

1360
01:50:37,576 --> 01:50:42,206
And to save it, I can leave home.

1361
01:50:42,347 --> 01:50:45,316
Wow! Wonderful!

1362
01:50:46,218 --> 01:50:47,708
Madhvi.

1363
01:50:49,688 --> 01:50:51,178
She speaks well.

1364
01:50:51,289 --> 01:50:54,122
Yes, she didn't have
this quality before.

1365
01:50:54,392 --> 01:50:57,486
And you will see the
effect in a few years

1366
01:50:57,596 --> 01:51:00,224
It's a new development. - What?

1367
01:51:02,867 --> 01:51:05,563
Wonder who she's been influenced by.

1368
01:51:06,338 --> 01:51:09,466
Who says you can't
make a hole in the sky?

1369
01:51:09,574 --> 01:51:13,203
Who says you can't
make a hole in the sky?

1370
01:51:13,578 --> 01:51:18,038
Try hurling a stone
with all your might.

1371
01:51:18,316 --> 01:51:20,580
Wonderful!

1372
01:51:21,119 --> 01:51:22,677
Wonderful, Madhvi.

1373
01:51:27,392 --> 01:51:29,257
This is the daily routine.

1374
01:51:29,361 --> 01:51:31,329
Rudy. Where is she?

1375
01:51:31,429 --> 01:51:33,260
Where's the real deal?

1376
01:51:33,365 --> 01:51:35,162
Lts coming, Tiwari.

1377
01:51:35,300 --> 01:51:37,131
Sit down. Be patient.

1378
01:51:37,235 --> 01:51:38,224
Patience?

1379
01:51:38,336 --> 01:51:41,134
My eyes are getting sore.

1380
01:51:43,608 --> 01:51:45,599
She's coming.

1381
01:51:48,213 --> 01:51:49,646
She's here.

1382
01:51:50,215 --> 01:51:54,345
Here I come. - Come here.

1383
01:52:05,196 --> 01:52:09,064
Shall I tell this to the media...
publicly?

1384
01:52:09,167 --> 01:52:13,763
Shall I tell this to the media...
publicly?

1385
01:52:14,039 --> 01:52:18,271
My beloved talks about
politics behind closed doors.

1386
01:52:18,376 --> 01:52:23,473
My beloved talks about
politics behind closed doors.

1387
01:52:24,149 --> 01:52:28,176
Shall I tell this to the media...
publicly?

1388
01:52:28,320 --> 01:52:32,848
My beloved talks about
politics behind closed doors.

1389
01:52:33,358 --> 01:52:37,795
My beloved talks about
politics behind closed doors.

1390
01:53:02,320 --> 01:53:06,256
You were a man. Tall and strong.
Never feared anyone.

1391
01:53:06,891 --> 01:53:11,351
Since you became a politician,
you've lost all zest and zeal.

1392
01:53:11,663 --> 01:53:16,157
This bed was meant for two,
but now it misses all the action.

1393
01:53:16,301 --> 01:53:21,034
It now prays for solace.

1394
01:53:21,139 --> 01:53:25,769
The heart desires
those good old days back.

1395
01:53:26,044 --> 01:53:30,504
My beloved talks about
politics behind closed doors.

1396
01:53:40,625 --> 01:53:45,119
You would hold me so romantically.

1397
01:53:45,497 --> 01:53:49,456
You would cajole me each time I was
upset, those were beautiful moments.

1398
01:53:49,567 --> 01:53:50,397
Tiwari.

1399
01:53:50,502 --> 01:53:52,595
You take me in your
arms and shout slogans.

1400
01:53:52,704 --> 01:53:54,729
I don't like that.

1401
01:53:55,173 --> 01:53:57,471
Be the minister of my heart.

1402
01:53:57,575 --> 01:53:59,668
Don't trouble me anymore.

1403
01:53:59,811 --> 01:54:04,373
Don't let those bad
days come back again.

1404
01:54:04,482 --> 01:54:09,351
My beloved talks about
politics behind closed doors.

1405
01:54:14,559 --> 01:54:18,655
Shall I tell this to the media...
publicly?

1406
01:54:18,797 --> 01:54:23,496
Shall I tell this to the media...
publicly?

1407
01:54:23,601 --> 01:54:28,197
My beloved talks about
politics behind closed doors.

1408
01:54:28,406 --> 01:54:32,843
My beloved talks about
politics behind closed doors.

1409
01:54:33,211 --> 01:54:37,477
My beloved talks about
politics behind closed doors.

1410
01:54:38,049 --> 01:54:42,645
My beloved talks about
politics behind closed doors.

1411
01:54:42,787 --> 01:54:45,347
Where are you going?

1412
01:54:46,324 --> 01:54:48,053
Come here.

1413
01:54:50,462 --> 01:54:54,796
Come on.

1414
01:54:55,066 --> 01:54:57,193
Where should I hide?

1415
01:54:57,869 --> 01:54:58,858
Caught you.

1416
01:54:59,137 --> 01:55:00,502
I want to play too.

1417
01:55:00,605 --> 01:55:03,472
I'll give you a chocolate?

1418
01:55:07,212 --> 01:55:11,444
Did you say anything else to Saheb?

1419
01:55:18,656 --> 01:55:21,489
No. Just praised you.

1420
01:55:22,293 --> 01:55:24,193
You don't know Saheb.

1421
01:55:24,395 --> 01:55:25,828
He can do anything.

1422
01:55:26,631 --> 01:55:27,825
And that Ranjana.

1423
01:55:28,099 --> 01:55:30,294
He's very close to Saheb.

1424
01:55:40,712 --> 01:55:44,079
Will you do something for me?
- Just name it.

1425
01:55:46,551 --> 01:55:48,280
Kill that Ranjana for me.

1426
01:55:50,421 --> 01:55:51,786
Will you kill her?

1427
01:55:56,861 --> 01:55:59,056
Father, I'm sure it will
be in everyone's interest.

1428
01:55:59,297 --> 01:56:01,527
Just talk to him.

1429
01:56:02,333 --> 01:56:03,459
Yes.

1430
01:56:06,504 --> 01:56:07,835
It's father.

1431
01:56:11,676 --> 01:56:13,303
Good morning, Bunny uncle.

1432
01:56:15,346 --> 01:56:18,509
I want to apologize.

1433
01:56:19,884 --> 01:56:22,580
Yes. Rudy's under pressure as well.

1434
01:56:22,687 --> 01:56:24,484
Madhvi's with you too.

1435
01:56:24,756 --> 01:56:28,089
I don't like our personal
argument getting public.

1436
01:56:28,293 --> 01:56:29,885
I admit my mistake.

1437
01:56:30,161 --> 01:56:31,719
I just want to meet once.

1438
01:56:31,863 --> 01:56:34,263
Call Akshay and Ishaan.

1439
01:56:34,432 --> 01:56:35,558
I will call Rudy.

1440
01:56:35,667 --> 01:56:38,329
Don't tell Madhvi about this meeting.

1441
01:56:38,636 --> 01:56:40,536
I want to surprise her.

1442
01:56:40,738 --> 01:56:42,535
I'll call a few journalists.

1443
01:56:42,840 --> 01:56:45,707
Why do a good thing
when nobody's watching?

1444
01:56:45,910 --> 01:56:47,172
Right?

1445
01:56:56,220 --> 01:56:57,312
What's all this?

1446
01:56:57,422 --> 01:57:00,186
Seems like the entire market.

1447
01:57:03,895 --> 01:57:05,522
What do you want?

1448
01:57:05,697 --> 01:57:08,393
Looks like he's prepared
for an entire army.

1449
01:57:16,741 --> 01:57:20,199
So, Aditya, what do you want to say?

1450
01:57:38,763 --> 01:57:40,424
What do you want?

1451
01:57:40,531 --> 01:57:43,898
I want everything to be normal
once the bill's passed tomorrow.

1452
01:57:44,702 --> 01:57:46,329
Ranjana...

1453
01:57:46,604 --> 01:57:48,231
We'll call-off this engagement.

1454
01:57:48,539 --> 01:57:50,200
And throw a big party...

1455
01:57:50,341 --> 01:57:52,832
...where we'll tell everyone
about our association.

1456
01:57:53,344 --> 01:57:54,641
I want to surprise Madhvi as well.

1457
01:57:54,746 --> 01:57:56,771
I hope you didn't
tell Madhvi about this.

1458
01:57:57,181 --> 01:57:59,649
I... You asked me not to.

1459
01:57:59,751 --> 01:58:01,651
So how could I?

1460
01:58:01,919 --> 01:58:03,443
We're a man of our words.

1461
01:58:03,554 --> 01:58:05,749
Great. Wonderful.

1462
01:58:33,317 --> 01:58:36,548
We've always considered
you a family member.

1463
01:58:36,654 --> 01:58:40,146
Not just me, all of us.

1464
01:58:40,258 --> 01:58:42,385
But you always bullied us.

1465
01:58:42,493 --> 01:58:44,518
See. It's karma, Aditya.

1466
01:58:44,696 --> 01:58:47,324
And we meant nothing to you.

1467
01:58:47,699 --> 01:58:49,428
Come on, come on, guys.

1468
01:58:49,534 --> 01:58:52,662
Let's all have a drink.
- Aditya, want some?

1469
01:58:53,104 --> 01:58:54,594
Don't drink too much.

1470
01:58:54,872 --> 01:58:56,339
You'll fall short of it.

1471
01:58:56,574 --> 01:58:58,542
How do you have a phone?

1472
01:58:58,643 --> 01:59:00,577
Fine, bolt the windows from outside.

1473
01:59:00,678 --> 01:59:03,146
Aditya, how did you
bring the phone inside?

1474
01:59:03,281 --> 01:59:08,150
All these things, the juice, water...

1475
01:59:09,320 --> 01:59:10,685
...all that's for everyone.

1476
01:59:10,822 --> 01:59:12,153
What?

1477
01:59:12,290 --> 01:59:15,623
It means, you all will have
to stay in this room for a few days.

1478
01:59:16,160 --> 01:59:16,558
What?

1479
01:59:16,661 --> 01:59:20,722
You must have felt really
happy seeing me apologize.

1480
01:59:21,299 --> 01:59:25,292
Pardon me,
but your happiness was short-lived.

1481
01:59:25,403 --> 01:59:26,836
Has he lost it?

1482
01:59:27,105 --> 01:59:28,572
Have you lost your mind?

1483
01:59:28,673 --> 01:59:31,608
Rudy. Don't get too excited.

1484
01:59:31,709 --> 01:59:34,405
Excited. What excitement?

1485
01:59:36,080 --> 01:59:37,741
Aditya!

1486
01:59:39,684 --> 01:59:40,548
Aditya!

1487
01:59:40,651 --> 01:59:44,815
I'll have no qualms
about killing you.

1488
01:59:47,125 --> 01:59:48,888
I've can stand up now.

1489
01:59:49,761 --> 01:59:52,628
And now, I'll bully you more.

1490
01:59:58,669 --> 02:00:00,432
Tariq. - Vishnu.

1491
02:00:03,241 --> 02:00:04,401
What's happening?

1492
02:00:10,715 --> 02:00:12,478
Please be quiet.

1493
02:00:12,583 --> 02:00:14,278
Calm down.

1494
02:00:14,552 --> 02:00:16,213
Quiet! Quiet!

1495
02:00:16,320 --> 02:00:18,515
They're unreachable
since yesterday...

1496
02:00:18,623 --> 02:00:21,114
...and they had to be at
the assembly, but they are missing.

1497
02:00:21,225 --> 02:00:25,161
How can I answer
you without asking them?

1498
02:00:25,496 --> 02:00:28,260
It can be a conspiracy.
- Of course it is.

1499
02:00:28,366 --> 02:00:30,095
Or, someone's pressurized them.

1500
02:00:30,201 --> 02:00:32,192
Pressure?

1501
02:00:32,403 --> 02:00:33,734
Who could pressurize them?

1502
02:00:33,871 --> 02:00:35,304
They could've been kidnapped too.

1503
02:00:35,406 --> 02:00:37,738
What have you done about it?
- Tell us.

1504
02:00:40,077 --> 02:00:43,342
Madhvi ma'am...

1505
02:00:43,447 --> 02:00:45,142
Madhvi ma'am.
Madhvi ma'am, please wait.

1506
02:00:45,249 --> 02:00:46,739
Hey, you blue shirt.

1507
02:00:47,218 --> 02:00:48,207
What were you saying?

1508
02:00:48,352 --> 02:00:49,717
Sir, the opposition
can be behind this.

1509
02:00:49,854 --> 02:00:51,549
The opposition can't be behind this.

1510
02:00:51,656 --> 02:00:53,419
All the goons are in his party.

1511
02:00:54,492 --> 02:00:56,619
Say that openly. - It's true!

1512
02:00:57,261 --> 02:01:00,196
I won't tolerate this misbehavior.

1513
02:01:00,331 --> 02:01:01,730
Sir.

1514
02:01:02,099 --> 02:01:04,499
The division's been annulled,
will the CM be changed too?

1515
02:01:04,602 --> 02:01:05,830
Just a minute.

1516
02:01:06,237 --> 02:01:07,226
Jai Hind, sir.

1517
02:01:07,705 --> 02:01:09,172
Yes, sir.

1518
02:01:10,208 --> 02:01:13,075
Sir, let's wait for a few days.

1519
02:01:16,347 --> 02:01:17,541
Look.

1520
02:01:18,516 --> 02:01:20,575
I'm no longer the
party's spokesperson.

1521
02:01:21,219 --> 02:01:23,585
That means the CM's changed.

1522
02:01:27,058 --> 02:01:28,389
We've been deceived!

1523
02:01:28,492 --> 02:01:30,289
We've been deceived!

1524
02:01:30,394 --> 02:01:32,794
They should've told us they
weren't coming to the assembly.

1525
02:01:33,064 --> 02:01:34,554
Is Saheb behind this?

1526
02:01:34,665 --> 02:01:37,566
Of course. - No photos.

1527
02:01:37,802 --> 02:01:39,531
It's Saheb. - No photos.

1528
02:01:40,338 --> 02:01:42,329
We've been deceived!

1529
02:01:42,707 --> 02:01:44,698
Why are you stopping us?

1530
02:01:45,843 --> 02:01:47,834
You're getting violent these days.

1531
02:01:49,146 --> 02:01:50,841
Control yourself.

1532
02:01:52,083 --> 02:01:54,813
Now they'll publish nonsense
about you every day.

1533
02:02:02,493 --> 02:02:05,462
Take some of this,
and get some sleep.

1534
02:02:13,571 --> 02:02:17,803
When I turned to my right
I saw a big fully grown tiger.

1535
02:02:18,476 --> 02:02:20,671
I had no idea... - My God.

1536
02:02:35,559 --> 02:02:37,527
Hello. - Ranjana.

1537
02:02:38,429 --> 02:02:39,623
Yes.

1538
02:02:40,498 --> 02:02:43,558
I want to meet you tomorrow,
in any condition.

1539
02:02:44,635 --> 02:02:46,330
I've a plan.

1540
02:02:49,106 --> 02:02:50,801
Just one blow.

1541
02:02:51,642 --> 02:02:54,338
Where? - At my palace.

1542
02:02:55,079 --> 02:02:56,307
Okay?

1543
02:02:57,114 --> 02:02:58,877
Yes.

1544
02:02:59,583 --> 02:03:00,709
Okay.

1545
02:03:01,085 --> 02:03:02,848
I love you, my darling.

1546
02:03:22,673 --> 02:03:24,402
This was our hall.

1547
02:03:25,209 --> 02:03:27,302
We used to have parties here.

1548
02:03:32,049 --> 02:03:34,449
This was the biggest
fort in the area.

1549
02:03:38,222 --> 02:03:42,716
Now do you understand
why I took so much pride?

1550
02:03:48,599 --> 02:03:51,363
The gun Saheb keeps waiving around...

1551
02:03:51,869 --> 02:03:54,667
...you need to get that.

1552
02:03:58,709 --> 02:04:00,643
You've to kill Madhvi.

1553
02:04:04,782 --> 02:04:06,215
At night.

1554
02:04:07,651 --> 02:04:09,312
At the time she listens to the music.

1555
02:04:12,590 --> 02:04:15,024
No one has a gun in the house.

1556
02:04:15,259 --> 02:04:17,591
Listen. - Yes.

1557
02:04:18,662 --> 02:04:21,688
Saheb and Madhvi's relation
is spoiled, everyone knows that.

1558
02:04:22,566 --> 02:04:24,329
No one else will be accused for it.

1559
02:04:25,202 --> 02:04:27,636
Saheb will be arrested for murder,
case closed.

1560
02:04:29,473 --> 02:04:30,565
Can you do it?

1561
02:04:32,276 --> 02:04:34,471
Come. I'll introduce you to someone.

1562
02:04:37,181 --> 02:04:39,342
This is my younger brother,
Param. - Hello.

1563
02:04:41,585 --> 02:04:43,314
Hey. Who was that?

1564
02:04:46,824 --> 02:04:47,552
Back.

1565
02:04:47,658 --> 02:04:49,751
Stay here. I'll be right back.

1566
02:05:06,477 --> 02:05:07,671
See anyone?

1567
02:05:07,812 --> 02:05:09,609
Ranjana, leave now.

1568
02:05:09,747 --> 02:05:10,771
Whoever it was, he was sent by Saheb.

1569
02:05:11,048 --> 02:05:12,276
He has seen us together.

1570
02:05:12,550 --> 02:05:13,448
But, listen.

1571
02:05:13,551 --> 02:05:14,711
What will you say to Saheb?

1572
02:05:14,819 --> 02:05:16,753
I'll say that I wandered
to this place accidentally...

1573
02:05:17,021 --> 02:05:19,012
...and you caught me.

1574
02:05:19,390 --> 02:05:20,448
And...

1575
02:05:21,592 --> 02:05:22,650
Fine, you go.

1576
02:05:22,793 --> 02:05:25,227
And, will you handle it? - Yes.

1577
02:05:25,429 --> 02:05:28,262
What about the gun? - I will try.

1578
02:05:29,333 --> 02:05:34,032
Look, just get the gun.
I will kill her.

1579
02:05:34,805 --> 02:05:37,467
I can go to any limits for this war.

1580
02:05:38,275 --> 02:05:39,333
Okay.

1581
02:05:52,189 --> 02:05:55,750
Brother, we shouldn't
be sitting out in the open.

1582
02:05:55,860 --> 02:05:58,795
You never know who might attack us?

1583
02:05:59,230 --> 02:06:00,788
That's the reason I'm
sitting out in the open.

1584
02:06:01,065 --> 02:06:02,532
I want someone to attack.

1585
02:06:03,467 --> 02:06:04,559
Let him.

1586
02:06:04,668 --> 02:06:06,602
So I would know who he is.

1587
02:06:07,471 --> 02:06:08,699
What are you staring at?

1588
02:06:09,106 --> 02:06:10,073
Anything interesting?

1589
02:06:10,174 --> 02:06:11,801
Who are you talking to?

1590
02:06:13,410 --> 02:06:15,275
You rascal.

1591
02:06:16,347 --> 02:06:17,644
Beat him.

1592
02:06:22,887 --> 02:06:24,184
Ranjana.

1593
02:06:24,788 --> 02:06:27,689
After travelling towards the jungle
for 12 kilometers from Bandnapur...

1594
02:06:27,791 --> 02:06:29,383
...you'll come across a mud house.

1595
02:06:30,127 --> 02:06:32,527
You will find all your answers there.

1596
02:07:10,701 --> 02:07:13,329
Hold it. Hold it.

1597
02:07:13,771 --> 02:07:15,136
Turn around.

1598
02:07:16,307 --> 02:07:17,535
Turn around.

1599
02:07:27,351 --> 02:07:29,615
So I heard right about you.

1600
02:07:30,754 --> 02:07:32,551
Kanhaiyya never dies.

1601
02:07:32,656 --> 02:07:34,783
And he won't die today either.

1602
02:07:52,343 --> 02:07:55,870
You wanted to know my chief, right?

1603
02:07:56,313 --> 02:07:57,439
So, tell me.

1604
02:07:58,749 --> 02:08:00,546
Inderjeet Singh.

1605
02:08:02,119 --> 02:08:03,711
My elder brother.

1606
02:08:04,922 --> 02:08:09,484
And do you want to know
something about your family?

1607
02:08:10,194 --> 02:08:11,218
What?

1608
02:08:11,395 --> 02:08:14,159
Your great grandmother
ran away from home.

1609
02:08:14,832 --> 02:08:15,799
Then?

1610
02:08:16,734 --> 02:08:21,262
She betrayed the one she eloped with.

1611
02:08:22,740 --> 02:08:27,302
Then your family decimated
her entire family.

1612
02:08:28,879 --> 02:08:33,839
And the one she ran away
with was my great grandfather.

1613
02:08:43,560 --> 02:08:49,795
By the way, the women of
your family are really famous.

1614
02:08:51,468 --> 02:08:57,873
I heard that your wife was
having an affair with some Bablu...

1615
02:09:24,268 --> 02:09:25,599
Let's get out. Quickly.

1616
02:09:25,803 --> 02:09:27,293
Is the press around.

1617
02:09:27,404 --> 02:09:30,134
Aditya, rascal.

1618
02:09:30,240 --> 02:09:31,707
Don't abuse him.

1619
02:10:05,876 --> 02:10:08,106
No one will talk about this anymore.

1620
02:10:08,212 --> 02:10:10,146
Hello, congratulations.

1621
02:11:48,712 --> 02:11:50,703
What do you say, Kanhaiyya?

1622
02:11:51,682 --> 02:11:54,082
Was I right to remarry?

1623
02:11:55,219 --> 02:11:56,846
All I wish is your
good health, Saheb.

1624
02:11:57,588 --> 02:11:59,385
That's all I care about.

1625
02:12:06,296 --> 02:12:08,821
Everyone said Kanhaiyya
is Saheb's shadow.

1626
02:12:09,399 --> 02:12:14,302
But now, you've to hide from
your own shadow because of me.

1627
02:12:15,372 --> 02:12:16,771
That's fine, Saheb.

1628
02:12:18,442 --> 02:12:21,104
I never liked the crowd anyway.

1629
02:12:23,280 --> 02:12:24,508
Cheers.

1630
02:12:26,216 --> 02:12:27,183
Drink.

1631
02:12:27,451 --> 02:12:28,440
You...

1632
02:12:31,788 --> 02:12:34,689
As soon as I reached there,
that was it...

1633
02:12:35,158 --> 02:12:36,420
You were saying...

1634
02:12:36,660 --> 02:12:39,686
Param sir was a daring officer.

1635
02:12:40,831 --> 02:12:43,356
He would've survived
if he had taken us along.

1636
02:12:43,534 --> 02:12:46,196
He asked us not to follow.

1637
02:12:46,303 --> 02:12:48,294
And asked us to
surround from the back.

1638
02:12:58,415 --> 02:13:01,873
Hello, I wanted a favor.

1639
02:13:04,655 --> 02:13:06,452
For the last time.

1640
02:14:13,190 --> 02:14:16,717
There was once a king and a queen.

1641
02:14:34,077 --> 02:14:35,408
Go inside and tell them.

1642
02:14:35,512 --> 02:14:37,070
You can go inside
only over my dead body.

1643
02:14:37,347 --> 02:14:40,441
Sir. This man shot my brother dead.

1644
02:14:40,584 --> 02:14:42,415
You cannot even touch him,
- Please arrest him.

1645
02:14:42,519 --> 02:14:44,487
Look, this is a police case.

1646
02:14:44,688 --> 02:14:48,089
If you interfere,
you'll have to pay for it dearly.

1647
02:14:48,392 --> 02:14:50,326
What can you do? - What's going on?

1648
02:14:50,861 --> 02:14:53,056
Saheb! You will have to come
to the police station with us.

1649
02:14:53,330 --> 02:14:54,524
We've an arrest warrant for you.

1650
02:14:54,631 --> 02:14:57,532
To hell with your arrest... - Sunder.

1651
02:14:59,403 --> 02:15:00,597
Come, Saheb.

1652
02:15:07,177 --> 02:15:09,077
Go inside and get the evidence.

1653
02:15:09,179 --> 02:15:10,544
Let me talk to the CM.

1654
02:15:11,348 --> 02:15:12,372
Hello. - Sir.

1655
02:15:26,163 --> 02:15:27,152
Sir.

1656
02:15:27,397 --> 02:15:28,830
Here's the revolver, sir.

1657
02:15:36,506 --> 02:15:38,303
Hey. No one will take any picture.

1658
02:15:38,408 --> 02:15:40,205
Let's go, sir.

1659
02:15:40,610 --> 02:15:42,077
Let's go, sir.

1660
02:15:42,746 --> 02:15:45,510
Sir, we won't tolerate
violent behavior.

1661
02:16:19,483 --> 02:16:20,711
What's happened?

1662
02:16:21,118 --> 02:16:22,346
What's going on?

1663
02:16:22,753 --> 02:16:25,085
Someone has sent this for you.

1664
02:16:27,491 --> 02:16:31,552
We had a seen a dream,
but couldn't fulfill it.

1665
02:16:35,098 --> 02:16:37,658
We had to fulfill it together.

1666
02:16:39,102 --> 02:16:41,832
And you suddenly
disappeared from the scene.

1667
02:16:42,506 --> 02:16:43,700
What happened?

1668
02:16:44,274 --> 02:16:46,902
What happened, Ranjana?

1669
02:16:49,546 --> 02:16:51,343
I've a personal war.

1670
02:16:51,448 --> 02:16:55,111
Mine alone, and I'm ending it.

1671
02:16:55,852 --> 02:16:57,820
And I am winning it too.

1672
02:16:59,289 --> 02:17:03,157
I can't celebrate my victory.

1673
02:17:21,578 --> 02:17:24,206
I will definitely trouble you.

1674
02:17:24,848 --> 02:17:27,544
You cannot forget me.

1675
02:17:28,451 --> 02:17:30,442
I'll come in your dreams.

1676
02:17:33,089 --> 02:17:34,454
Sometimes.

1677
02:17:38,795 --> 02:17:43,255
There was once a king, and a queen.

1678
02:18:08,291 --> 02:18:09,849
Greetings, madam.

1679
02:18:10,126 --> 02:18:13,527
Glory to... - Madhvi Devi!

1680
02:18:13,630 --> 02:18:15,188
Today, you've all gathered here...

1681
02:18:15,298 --> 02:18:17,664
...for Aditya Pratap
Singh's birthday.

1682
02:18:17,767 --> 02:18:20,292
And I'm grateful for that.

1683
02:18:20,737 --> 02:18:23,069
When will Aditya Pratap
Singh be released?

1684
02:18:23,173 --> 02:18:26,768
I wish he was here right now.

1685
02:18:26,877 --> 02:18:30,540
Glory to... - Madhvi Devi!

1686
02:18:30,647 --> 02:18:34,242
Glory to... - Madhvi Devi!

1687
02:18:34,351 --> 02:18:39,550
Glory to... - Madhvi Devi!

1688
02:18:42,659 --> 02:18:44,718
Take me in your arms...

1689
02:18:45,228 --> 02:18:50,894
...this beautiful moment
might not come again.

1690
02:18:55,438 --> 02:18:57,633
Madam, you have four more
meetings scheduled for today.

1691
02:18:57,874 --> 02:19:00,308
If you want I can confirm with them.

1692
02:19:00,543 --> 02:19:01,532
Yes madam.

1693
02:19:01,645 --> 02:19:03,306
Conference room is in the left side.

1694
02:19:03,413 --> 02:19:10,251
'Why do I always get men,
why not a poet? '
