1
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:10,370
My name is Brandon Bryant. I'm a 27-year-old
veteran. I was born here. Born in Missoula.

2
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:18,660
I was very much an introvert growing up. Single
mother, two sisters, crap load of female cousins.

3
00:00:19,509 --> 00:00:26,329
Um, so I was pretty much alone all the time.
And I grew up with books and comic books and

4
00:00:26,329 --> 00:00:32,579
heroes and villains.
I kind of grew up optimistic, idealistic.

5
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:39,149
I grew up in a Christian home. I wasn't necessarily
too patriotic. I was more of the fact of good

6
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:45,160
guys versus bad guys, making decisions, and
doing the right thing. I decided to get into

7
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:54,199
the Air Force because I was racking up college
debt and I didn't know what else to do.

8
00:00:54,210 --> 00:01:01,179
So when I was talking to the Air Force recruiter,
he's like, "You know those guys that sit in

9
00:01:01,179 --> 00:01:06,380
the, the operations center for James Bond
and gather the intelligence he needs to do

10
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:11,170
his mission?" And I was like, "Yeah, I know
those guys. Like, like 'Q' and all them."

11
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:15,800
And he's like, "Yeah, you'll be like one of
those guys". And I was like, "That's pretty badass."

12
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:19,120
Getting into the drone program was weird.

13
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:23,840
The introduction is like, "this is what we
do. We kill people and break things. That

14
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:29,900
is what our job is". And, like, I worried
about it, you know, like, like, "Can I do

15
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:33,450
this? Can I actually kill someone? Could I
actually pull the trigger?" I mean, I'm not

16
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:36,890
actually pulling the trigger, I'm guiding
the missile in but it's essentially the same

17
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:42,530
thing. I don't, I don't see a difference.
We typically flew in Iraq, between 8,000 and

18
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:50,670
12,000 feet. And then in Afghanistan, we flew
between 18,000 and 25,000 feet. And depending

19
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:54,640
on atmospherics, if it was a completely clear
day, you would definitely get a good picture.

20
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,200
And depending on how close you were, you could
probably read the license plate on someone's

21
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,860
car.
We can see something as simple as people playing

22
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:08,660
a soccer game. We can see individual players
and we can even see the ball.

23
00:02:09,834 --> 00:02:13,494
Tariq was the best defender.

24
00:02:14,194 --> 00:02:17,814
He was a very funny guy.

25
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,860
He was really fond of sports.

26
00:02:28,275 --> 00:02:30,955
He loved soccer.

27
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:49,920
It would have been a seven or eight hour trip

28
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:56,680
for 16-year-old Tariq, through treacherous
terrain, through potential Taliban hot spots.

29
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:01,180
And of course, under drone surveillance.

30
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:16,779
It was the first time that the international

31
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:22,769
media, the drone victims, the tribal elders
and the general public came together. It was

32
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:27,639
held in a five-star hotel. The tribal elders
spoke in terms of political implications,

33
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:33,900
how they felt and the drone victims spoke
about personal stories.

34
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:37,760
The drones attack us and the whole world is silent.

35
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,990
I raise my voice to take a stand.

36
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:46,480
You press a button an annihilate entire families and tribes.

37
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:54,440
This is a part of the drone, the missile that
was used to kill that child.

38
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:00,260
It was a gathering to get the voice of the
victims of drone attacks out to the general

39
00:04:00,269 --> 00:04:03,950
public, as well as the rest of the world.
And that was the main goal. We were gonna

40
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:11,849
use the media to try and establish who had
been killed and also why, where and how.

41
00:04:11,849 --> 00:04:18,620
Well, because of the inaccessibility of Waziristan,
it's very, very hard to compile any kind of

42
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:23,259
credible evidence or evidence that other people
will see as credible. That was part of the

43
00:04:23,259 --> 00:04:26,650
reason we organized this conference in Islamabad.
We called it a jirga.

44
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:28,580
A jirga is a traditional tribal gathering.

45
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:32,800
It's what people in that area use to settle
their disputes.

46
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,200
This is simply indiscriminate bombing!  There are so many women and children killed.

47
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:41,640
At one stage I came across a young boy, Tariq

48
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:48,110
Aziz. When I was talking to Tariq, one of
the first things that he did was he handed

49
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:53,139
me his cousin's student I.D. card. And as
I looked at it, I looked back at Tariq, and

50
00:04:53,139 --> 00:04:58,310
I noticed that he was crying. He started to
tell me the story of his cousin who had been

51
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:03,830
killed from a drone strike. He had come to
the jirga primarily to inform us a little

52
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:08,530
bit more about what had happened to his cousin,
to people in his local village and find out

53
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:13,520
how to stop the killing.
We sat together all day. We ate together at

54
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:19,770
lunchtime. We laughed together. We became
friends. Tariq was extremely intelligent and

55
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:25,650
funny to be around. He had a nice sense of
humor. He was fascinated by photography and

56
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:32,258
intrigued by western music, mentioning artists
and one that sprang to mind was Lady Gaga.

57
00:05:32,259 --> 00:05:37,530
He started to talk about drone strikes in
his village. How he was unable to sleep at

58
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:45,549
night, he was scared, he was worried about
his family, his friends, Tariq was traumatized.

59
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:50,389
He wanted to talk about how he was affected
by drone attacks and basically to give the

60
00:05:50,389 --> 00:05:55,000
message that people of Waziristan want justice
against the killing of innocent civilians

61
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,700
under drone attacks that are operated by the
U.S.

62
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:05,000
I've been to Waziristan and have taken pictures and collected evidence

63
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
That neither the CIAnor the American government can disprove.

64
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,860
But the most painful story that I have come across

65
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:14,880
was of theses children.

66
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:23,219
Their brother was killed in a drone strike.

67
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:31,100
But what they didn't know was that their parents were also killed.

68
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:37,378
And the 
people who had gathered there adopted a resolution

69
00:06:37,379 --> 00:06:41,629
condemning the strikes.   [APPLAUSE]

70
00:06:41,629 --> 00:06:45,909
The outcome of the jirga was a big success
because it allowed people to come together,

71
00:06:45,909 --> 00:06:52,680
listen to stories and come to common resolution.
Then we went together to a rally, and Tariq

72
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,110
Aziz traveled there with us.

73
00:06:55,110 --> 00:07:02,110
We traveled towards the rally and Tariq sat
next to me. He seemed relaxed, he was laughing

74
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:07,950
with his friends. Tariq and everybody else
got out and they went to the rally.

75
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:20,699
Thousands of Pakistanis came to support a
giant rally on Sunday.

76
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:25,189
The protest against the United States' drone
attacks in Pakistan.

77
00:07:25,189 --> 00:07:28,129
The drones are violating the people of Pakistan.

78
00:07:28,129 --> 00:07:30,880
as well as their human rights.

79
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,700
People from all over the country, irrespective

80
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:35,710
of their ages and backgrounds, came together
to the rally.

81
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:46,520
We want to send a message to America.

82
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:53,120
The more drone attacks you conduct, the more people will resent you.

83
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:58,180
After that, Tariq Aziz and the other attendees

84
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:00,240
returned to their homes.

85
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:06,940
He said the rally in Islamabad was huge, and that it would help our voices get heard.

86
00:08:19,363 --> 00:08:25,103
We were preparing for the soccer match the next day.

87
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:35,144
We told Tariq to pick up extra players for our game.

88
00:08:35,144 --> 00:08:41,183
Tariq left to tell some players, and we left to tell others.

89
00:08:45,105 --> 00:08:52,205
We were listening to music in the car.  Tariq's brother was with me.

90
00:09:06,688 --> 00:09:15,908
The car was completely destroyed, and the bodies of Tariq and his cousin were badly burned. 

91
00:09:18,574 --> 00:09:24,534
We took their bodies out and put them into our car.

92
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:31,700
When I saw Tariq's body I became very upset and disturbed.

93
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:37,180
Other people took me away because I became faint.

94
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:43,580
It was deeply disurbing to see the dead bodies of our friends and relatives.

95
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:54,000
[PHONE RINGS]

96
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,600
Two days later I got a call.

97
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,839
When the attack took place, I was in school in Bannu.

98
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:07,780
You know I heard about Tariq a few days later,
after I'd gone back to England

99
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:09,680
We were at prayer when we found out.

100
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,739
I got an email.

101
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:13,639
I was at work when we found out.
We got an email and a telephone call.

102
00:10:13,639 --> 00:10:21,439
Four days after the jirga, I received an email
from Shahzad. The email simply said "Tariq"

103
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:29,480
as the heading, and I opened it instantly.
To my shock, I found out that Tariq had been

104
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:34,610
murdered by a drone strike.
And that was a shock. I mean, it was like,

105
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:39,650
how? How is it possible? What, where was he?
What was he doing? And it's like, completely unbelievable.

106
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:43,410
He was just an innocent student. He was my student.

107
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:47,130
They said that [my brother] Tariq has been killed.

108
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,880
I could not believe it.

109
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,300
My initial thoughts were, this wasn't happening.

110
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:58,649
This was just a dream.
We didn't think that Tariq, the 16-year-old

111
00:10:58,649 --> 00:11:02,920
kid who wanted to talk about football, would
be killed in a drone attack the same week

112
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,400
that we'd met him.

113
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:29,760
I thought... oh God!  What has happened to us?

114
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:40,800
There is no happiness, no gatherings, not even soccer.

115
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:47,100
Happiness has disappeared along with Tariq.

116
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,800
It was a very bitter experience.

117
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:58,820
We're mentally tormented.

118
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:07,340
I mourned very much.

119
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:13,740
Because of drones innocent people get killed.

120
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:20,880
In Pashto there is a saying,

121
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:30,680
Let me be buried with your picture, in case I forget you in heaven.

122
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:39,680
Why did it happen? Why was 

123
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:44,490
Tariq killed?
If the U.S. had any information that Tariq

124
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:51,190
Aziz was part of a criminal organization,
was planning to carry out attacks on the United

125
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:55,790
States, then our Federal Law Enforcement Agents
should have been working with the authorities

126
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:59,630
of Pakistan to arrest him.
And one really has to ask the question why

127
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:05,180
the government was not able to arrest or even
question him. This is Islamabad we're talking

128
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:10,939
about. It's the capital of the country. Population's
over a million people.

129
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:16,320
Jirga was a real public event. It was at a
big hotel. It was advertised widely. It was

130
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:21,500
an open event.
Tariq Aziz was plainly visible to hundreds

131
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:28,500
and hundreds of people. He talked with reporters.
Everything about him that the authorities

132
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:33,449
could have wanted to know about his location
and about his recent activities were known

133
00:13:33,449 --> 00:13:36,979
to the United States.
So it would have been extremely easy for them

134
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:42,000
to approach him, sit down and talk to him
or for that matter, put him in jai. But instead,

135
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:48,779
the CIA chose to go and kill him without giving
him the opportunity to give his side of whatever

136
00:13:48,779 --> 00:13:54,120
it is that they thought that he had done.
There is no evidence there whatsoever. And

137
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:57,640
they've given him no lawyers, there is no
judge and there's no jury.

138
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:05,139
Our preference is always to capture if we
can, 'cause we can gather intelligence. But

139
00:14:05,139 --> 00:14:10,300
a lot of the terrorist networks that target
the United States, the most dangerous ones,

140
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:13,810
operate in very remote regions and it's very
difficult to capture them.

141
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:17,910
But what we can discern from the pattern of
strikes is that, essentially, Pakistan has

142
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:23,709
been declared a no-capture zone, um, that
automatically capture's not considered feasible.

143
00:14:23,709 --> 00:14:29,489
If you just look at the numbers, there have
been dramatically more people killed in recent

144
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:36,660
years than have been captured.
They've killed maybe 3,000 to 4,000 people

145
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:41,389
in targeted killings and they've captured
a handful.

146
00:14:41,389 --> 00:14:47,220
There are no CIA agents in Waziristan, so
they rely on local people.

147
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:51,970
And this is where the fundamental wrong is,
because these people are working for you for

148
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:55,660
money.
And that reliance is utterly misplaced and

149
00:14:55,660 --> 00:15:02,660
what you see in Tariq's case and it just pains
me to say this, that you know, without any

150
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:08,740
real room for dispute, that there was someone
in that room, when we were having our jirga,

151
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:17,120
who was an informant for the U.S. Intelligence
Services and that that person picked out Tariq,

152
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:22,579
I can tell you as a matter-of-fact that Tariq
was not an extremist and the way you know

153
00:15:22,579 --> 00:15:27,138
what intelligence they relied on to kill someone
is what they release immediately after the

154
00:15:27,139 --> 00:15:33,769
killing and in that case they said four militants
were killed. And of course we know that two

155
00:15:33,769 --> 00:15:40,459
kids were killed. Um, that's how it happened.
I asked the CIA about the strike and their

156
00:15:40,459 --> 00:15:47,459
response was on that day no child was killed.
In fact the adult males were supporting Al

157
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:54,480
Qaeda's facilitation network. So, despite
all of these technological assets and human

158
00:15:54,540 --> 00:16:01,000
assets, uh, we're not there, we don't know.
And I think there is a lot of room for error.

159
00:16:01,879 --> 00:16:07,779
Killing Tariq was clearly breaking the law.
In fact, it was further than that. It was

160
00:16:07,779 --> 00:16:13,420
just murder.
Tariq Aziz was one of almost 300 children

161
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:21,400
killed. Why are these children being killed?
This is a targeted, focused effort at people

162
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:27,400
who are on a list of active terrorists.
The killing of Tariq Aziz has to call into

163
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:30,380
question the credibility of the government's
kill list methodology.

164
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,379
The vast majority of the strikes here are
against people whose identities the government

165
00:16:34,379 --> 00:16:37,360
doesn't know.
We do not know where targeted killings are

166
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,560
authorized to be used. We do not know the
specific identities of people who have been

167
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:45,180
killed.
The constitution empowers the president to

168
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:49,170
protect the nation from any imminent threat
of attack.

169
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:55,628
So how can Tariq Aziz, a 16-year-old boy,
possibly meet that definition of imminent

170
00:16:55,629 --> 00:16:58,579
threat?
The Justice Department has defined an imminent

171
00:16:58,579 --> 00:17:02,920
threat based not on whether the threat is
specific and immediate, which is what "imminent"

172
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:05,899
means-
So that people pose imminent threats regardless

173
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:11,539
of whether they are actually engaged in any
ongoing, immediate attack against the United

174
00:17:11,539 --> 00:17:14,408
States.
We have a responsibility to defend this country

175
00:17:14,409 --> 00:17:19,909
and that's what we're doing.
Killing Tariq hasn't made us any safer. It's

176
00:17:19,909 --> 00:17:25,329
taken away a young boy's life. It's destroyed
a family and a community.

177
00:17:25,329 --> 00:17:29,200
Under the interpretations we've heard from
the administration and members of Congress,

178
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,510
drone strikes could go on indefinitely, against
enemies that keep morphing into new enemies.

179
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:36,700
But killing should be the exception, not the
rule.

180
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:41,260
Tariq Aziz should never have died. The U.S.
should not have been using military force

181
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:44,680
to attack innocent civilians, let alone children.

182
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,960
I would question a policy that says it is

183
00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:01,200
legitimate and even sensible to assassinate
a 16-year-old boy.

184
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:05,908
He was trying to be part of the constructive
way forward.

185
00:18:05,909 --> 00:18:12,300
Tariq wanted to do something to help. I think
he felt that he had more to give, more to

186
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:18,100
talk about and more to understand. And the
impact of Tariq's murder on my life has been

187
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:26,658
huge, made me reflect deeply and made me question
a lot of things. He has now become a symbolic

188
00:18:26,659 --> 00:18:32,319
figure in innocent children that have been
killed by drone strikes.

189
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,620
He was just a kid.

190
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,640
There's two guys in front, one guy in the

191
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:53,270
rear and they're walking up this path and,
uh, the two guys in front are discussing.

192
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:57,200
They're like; you can see them having an avid
conversation. They've got something slung

193
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:03,370
over their shoulders, which look to be, uh,
weapons. The mountainous portions of Afghanistan

194
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:12,668
are not so un-similar from the mountainous
regions of Montana, and seeing people with

195
00:19:12,669 --> 00:19:21,249
guns walking around the mountains of Afghanistan
was like, "Well, people are walking with guns

196
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:25,630
in the mountains of Montana".
But as soon as we get eyes on them, it's like,

197
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:31,659
immediately confirm they are weapons, confirm
your cleared target. So place the target at

198
00:19:31,659 --> 00:19:37,970
their feet and we get missiles away. Ends
up getting all three of them. But the guy

199
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:47,200
in the back, it ends up cutting his leg off
above the knee and severing his femoral artery.

200
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,320
Uh, and he's rolling around. He's holding
it, and he's just like rolling around, but

201
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:56,110
you can see, like, where his leg is missing
and the blood is spurting out and landing

202
00:19:56,110 --> 00:20:01,418
on the ground and it's cooling.
It's hot, it's a hot pool of blood and it's

203
00:20:01,419 --> 00:20:09,259
cooling. And we keep eyes on and watch the
guy become the same color as the ground that

204
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:19,859
he bled out on. I can almost see his facial
expression. It was, uh, I could almost see

205
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:28,870
his mouth open and crying out.
Maybe he cursed us, or maybe he asked Allah

206
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:33,360
for forgiveness for us. Who knows what his
last thoughts were? But it wasn't, it wasn't

207
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:38,129
pretty, whatever it was. It was shock and
trauma and his ears were probably ringing

208
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:49,620
and he was bleeding out and he was… in agony.
I didn't know how to react. No one teaches

209
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:54,560
you how to react. They teach you how to do
it.

210
00:20:54,570 --> 00:21:03,470
There's no, they ignore, they ignore the reaction
part. I wished I never contributed further to that.

211
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:13,158
Before any strike is taken, there must be

212
00:21:13,159 --> 00:21:20,159
near certainty that no civilians will be killed
or injured. The highest standard we can set.

213
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:30,300
The vast majority of those killed in drone
strikes? Over 98% have not been high value targets.

214
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:38,000
The adoptions of signature strikes make indiscriminate

215
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:42,960
killing, you know, a policy.
What they end up with is what I described

216
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,490
earlier, the signature strike.
They moved back to a greater reliance on these

217
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:50,240
signature strikes.
A signature strike is a drone strike that

218
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:57,780
isn't based on the identity of the target.
I obtained classified U.S. intelligence reports

219
00:21:57,789 --> 00:22:03,890
on drone strikes. What the documents reveal
are the way that signature strikes are put

220
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:10,120
together and these are strikes against people
who fit, who "fit" the signature of what the

221
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:14,800
U.S. government says is a terrorist.
Maybe they are walking in and out of the compound

222
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,918
with guns, maybe they're getting in trucks
and they're moving to the Afghan border.

223
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:23,929
And drone operators seated thousands of miles
away from the area affected are looking at

224
00:22:23,929 --> 00:22:29,490
video feeds, assessing those video feeds and
based on that, making decisions about whether

225
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:34,700
or not someone who's walking through the community
is a suspected terrorist. You conclude on

226
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:37,909
the basis of the behavior that they are a
terrorist and you kill them.

227
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:47,330
In a number of cases that I looked at, the
CIA wasn't sure who they were hitting.

228
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:55,919
The Agency became convinced that it had gotten
so good at watching from above that it could

229
00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:00,200
distinguish different groups. It could distinguish
whether a terrorist leader was at a certain

230
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:04,100
location.
But there is room for a lot of mis-understanding

231
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:06,539
when you're doing something like conducting
signature strikes.

232
00:23:06,539 --> 00:23:13,539
A drone strike is only as good as the intelligence
that is behind the actual strike.

233
00:23:13,669 --> 00:23:17,929
Anyone who's worked in intelligence knows
that intelligence doesn't, quote, unquote,

234
00:23:17,929 --> 00:23:24,169
prove anything. It's not evidence.
So drones hit what they aim to hit, but if

235
00:23:24,169 --> 00:23:27,720
they're aimed at the wrong people, then civilians
are killed.

236
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:33,789
Former U.S. Ambassador, Cameron Munter had
said that one man's combatant was another

237
00:23:33,789 --> 00:23:38,429
man's chump who went to a meeting.
When Leon Panetta was director of the CIA,

238
00:23:38,429 --> 00:23:45,429
uh, somebody memorably said, if Leon sees
a few guys doing jumping jacks on the ground,

239
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:50,260
he thinks that's a terrorist training camp.
Classified documents suggest U.S. officials

240
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:54,370
don't always know exactly how many or who
they're killing.

241
00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:59,120
They don't always have precise I.D.
The apparent targeting of people whose identity

242
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:02,770
not known-
They may not be as precise as many U.S. officials

243
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:06,360
claim.
As soon as those strikes begin, we start to

244
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:11,620
see another steep escalation in civilian casualties.
So that's what happens when signature strikes

245
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:16,889
go wrong. Large numbers of people die because
they don't know who's been killed in most

246
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:20,930
of the drone strikes.

247
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:30,540
On March 17, 2011, a jirga was held in Datta

248
00:24:30,549 --> 00:24:35,260
Khel to resolve a dispute over a chromite
mine.

249
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:40,720
If there is a feud getting out of hand, jirga
will convene and everyone has a chance to

250
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:47,559
speak. It really is a democracy and that is
a mechanism to make sure that there is stability

251
00:24:47,559 --> 00:24:49,399
in society.

252
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:56,220
There were more than forty people

253
00:24:56,680 --> 00:25:00,820
We were talking about chromite and the cutting of wood from the mountains.

254
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:03,220
I was sitting on the ground.

255
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:11,000
They held the jirga in an open space in a
bus depot in broad daylight. The tribal elders

256
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:16,679
informed the Pakistani military.
Brigadier Dogar was in command of the brigade

257
00:25:16,679 --> 00:25:22,270
on the border. So he is a key commander. The
Brigadier knew about the jirga ten days in

258
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:29,270
advance. His own army camp was ten kilometers
from the site of the jirga.

259
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:35,320
So this was an open, public event that pretty
much everyone in the community and surrounding

260
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:40,110
area knew about.
So the jirga begins in the morning and about

261
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:45,790
10:00 and after about twenty minutes or so...

262
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:52,210
EXPLOSIONS

263
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:56,790
Four missiles attacked us at 10:45am on March 17, 2011.

264
00:25:56,790 --> 00:26:03,530
Two missiles targeted the group where I was sitting, while two more targeted the other group.

265
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:12,380
There's smoke and debris and chaos.
It was a huge explosions, so people in the

266
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:16,300
shop, the nearby areas, they rushed 
to the place.

267
00:26:18,907 --> 00:26:28,907
When the attack took place, it became hell for us.

268
00:26:35,909 --> 00:26:43,689
I rushed there and found pieces of dead bodies all around.

269
00:26:43,689 --> 00:26:52,249
Some had no head, some had nohadns, some had no feet. They were all dead.

270
00:26:56,920 --> 00:27:04,000
Everyone was crying and screaming, asking why do these drone attacks kill our people.

271
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:14,200
When we got there, they said there were countless casualties.

272
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:20,660
All I saw were body parts and charred clothes.

273
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:26,880
When I got there someone showed me my father.

274
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:31,680
When I touched his skin it started to break like ashes.

275
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:58,400
All the elders had been killed, including my father.   I became very upset.

276
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:02,940
He was our only source of income.  We were all completely dependent on him.

277
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:18,680
I opened the casket and saw him.  My father was completely unrecognizable.

278
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:23,400
I couldn't tell which parts were his hands and which parts were his feet.

279
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:44,820
I feel pain in my legs.  My bones were broken so it aches. I have to have surgery again.

280
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:52,500
I have severe pain in my ears and also have psychological effects.

281
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:07,220
The loss of 40 leaders in one day is devastating

282
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:12,200
for that community. It's devastating in terms
of leadership, it's devastating in terms of

283
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:16,600
the moral compass and it's devastating in
economic terms as well.

284
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:20,139
The death of my father was a great loss for us.

285
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:25,760
He used to resolve disputes between the people.

286
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:29,760
He contributed to the welfare and happiness of the pepole in our area because he was an elected councilor.

287
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:33,800
This drone strike is coming at the end of

288
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:38,100
a series of drone strikes. It's feeding into
the sense of, no one is safe. No where is

289
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:44,100
safe. Nothing is safe. Even a jirga, the most
cherished, the most treasured institution

290
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:49,620
of the tribal areas. So we cannot even sit
down and resolve an issue. That is not safe anymore.

291
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:56,540
We cannot gather together because drones hover over our skies twenty four hours per day.

292
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:03,120
That impact has really affected the population
and their basic sense of security and basic

293
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:06,120
sense of living in that area.

294
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:15,760
Out lives are full of chaos and depression.

295
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:18,500
All our institutions have been destroyed.

296
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:29,260
Thank you very much and good afternoon, everyone.
Thank you for being here today.

297
00:30:29,269 --> 00:30:33,210
Three months after 42 civilians died, John
Brennan stood up and said-

298
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:39,590
Nearly for the past year, there hasn't been
a single collateral death because of the exceptional

299
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:44,260
proficiency, precision of the capabilities
that we've been able to develop.

300
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:50,779
High-level authorities tell the American public
that there have been no civilian casualties.

301
00:30:50,779 --> 00:30:59,159
They were presumably using this notion that
any male of a certain age roughly between

302
00:30:59,159 --> 00:31:06,159
14 and 60 who is killed is automatically counted
as a combatant.

303
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:10,399
The Vietnam body count as a metric was flawed.

304
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:15,840
It did not really give you a measure of how
successful you were being. In fact it led

305
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:21,678
you astray in assessing that. And the drone
strikes are the same way. They're the wrong

306
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:26,139
metric. Tell me how we're winning if every
time we kill one, we create ten?

307
00:31:26,139 --> 00:31:32,260
The strikes in Datta Khel caused a significant
negative reaction by Pakistani authorities

308
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:33,360
and by the Pakistani people.

309
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:38,230
Anti-American sentiment in Pakistan reached

310
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:43,899
greater heights.
That very large drone strike really upended

311
00:31:43,899 --> 00:31:48,490
U.S. - Pakistani relations.
I was a military guy for 25 years. I've done

312
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:55,490
seven wars. I'm not about being nice to the
enemy. But the blowback and the aspect of

313
00:31:55,720 --> 00:32:01,580
political destabilization, those things ultimately
do make us less safe.

314
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:05,360
The growing public outcry appears to have

315
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:10,490
at least compelled the country's top political
and military leadership to publicly denounce

316
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:15,250
U.S. drone attacks.
Violence is not the only solution. You have

317
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:21,700
a recourse available. You can go to Pakistani
courts to take up this matter legally.

318
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:27,149
We know the the judiciary system is available all over the world.

319
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:33,650
to provide justice for deprived people.

320
00:32:33,650 --> 00:32:41,500
We are helpless and uneducated therefore we have no voice.

321
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:44,110
I got in contact with Shahzad Akbar.

322
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:52,729
HIs colleagues came to me and advised me to raise the issue in court so that I could get justice.

323
00:32:52,730 --> 00:32:55,520
Relatives of the victims have decided to fight

324
00:32:55,529 --> 00:32:59,710
a legal battle against the CIA for killing
innocent civilians.

325
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:05,190
When we started with serving legal notices
and starting the drone litigation, my critics,

326
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:10,169
they were saying, "How can you do drone litigation?
Oh, there's no jurisdiction in the tribal

327
00:33:10,169 --> 00:33:12,809
areas." There were so many issues and there
were so many objections.

328
00:33:12,809 --> 00:33:17,668
It's a common joke in Pakistan that grandfather

329
00:33:17,669 --> 00:33:22,110
starts the litigation and then the grandson
actually gets to hear the verdict in that

330
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:28,830
case. But I decided to file the Peshawar High
Court litigation because the 17th March, 2011,

331
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:33,949
strike was a typical example of signature
strikes and what's wrong with them. But during

332
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:39,809
the process, the most interesting thing was
that in the last five years, more than 1,400

333
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:44,290
civilian Pakistanis have been killed in drone
strikes.

334
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:52,429
A Pakistani court has declared U.S. drone
attacks in the country a war crime.

335
00:33:52,429 --> 00:33:58,149
In a landmark judgment, the High Court described
the attacks as a blatant violation of Pakistan

336
00:33:58,149 --> 00:34:00,149
sovereignty.
The court ruled that the practice was illegal.

337
00:34:00,149 --> 00:34:05,719
A court in Pakistan has ruled that U.S. drone
strikes on Pakistani territory are illegal

338
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,920
and should be stopped.

339
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:19,540
They declared that in drone strikes, CIA officials

340
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:21,779
are committing the offense of murder.

341
00:34:27,139 --> 00:34:30,339
It's not a demand of Pakistan anymore that drone

342
00:34:30,350 --> 00:34:35,449
strikes should stop. It's their legal obligation
that drones need to stop.

343
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:51,120
We have proved that if you really want to
do something and if you really want to get

344
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:55,900
justice for people who have been denied justice,
you can achieve that.

345
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:03,680
The human rights organization, Reprieve, has
filed a lawsuit against the U.K. for its role

346
00:35:03,690 --> 00:35:06,990
in drone strikes.
Barack Obama is facing demands in court to

347
00:35:06,990 --> 00:35:11,649
reveal more about the U.S. drone program.
The ACLU filed a lawsuit on behalf of families

348
00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:17,000
of three Americans killed in drone strikes.
Drone victims accused John A. Rizzo of conspiracy

349
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,540
to wage a war of aggression to commit murder
and crimes against humanity.

350
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:28,720
Can you take the drones out of the hands of
the CIA?

351
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:31,259
Ma'am, let me, let me finish.
Can you stop the signature strikes?

352
00:35:31,270 --> 00:35:35,430
People on the ground are saying, "Where is
the accountability for this?"

353
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:40,690
It's unleashed a global citizen movement.

354
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,680
We don't feel that our government should be

355
00:35:44,690 --> 00:35:50,870
killing people without trial, without conviction.
It's a very, very wicked thing to do.

356
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:55,319
This demonstration, it's for Obama, for him

357
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,620
to transform the current policies of the United
States.

358
00:35:57,620 --> 00:36:01,250
Thousands gathered on Monday to condemn the
recent U.S. drone attacks.

359
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:05,940
Protestors in Atlanta say drones are dangerous,
and they want them banned.

360
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:10,130
In San Diego, there are regular protests outside
General Atomics.

361
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:14,770
Killer drones have no shame.
War is not a video game!

362
00:36:14,770 --> 00:36:21,200
We need to stop these killer drones from leading
us into a world of chaos and lawlessness.

363
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:28,200
You lawmakers, you senators, enough is enough!
I don't think the United States has the authority

364
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:31,880
to be going around the world deciding who
to assassinate.

365
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:44,600
Come in to work, told that they've found a
high-profile dude hanging out. We're told

366
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:50,730
that they're gonna, they have Intel that this
guy is there, and they're gonna strike him.

367
00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:57,650
And so, like, this guy's a high-ranking bad
guy, like, why not? There was a lot of activity

368
00:36:57,650 --> 00:37:05,190
there earlier that day. Pretty much everyone's
left but the Intel, that, the guy is still there.

369
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:12,260
And so, we fired.

370
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:16,140
And then six seconds before missile impact,

371
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:25,950
uh, something runs around the building. When
I brought that up, the screener who disseminated

372
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:32,450
the video feed said that it was a dog. But
I don't think that he ever mentioned a dog

373
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:41,270
the entire evening of them monitoring.
I mean, I, I was pretty much brand-spanking

374
00:37:41,270 --> 00:37:46,290
new at this. I'd only been doing it a couple
months, so who was I to question? I doubt

375
00:37:46,290 --> 00:37:53,850
myself at times. Like, maybe it was, I was
seeing things. But ultimately I believe there

376
00:37:53,850 --> 00:37:59,650
was a child killed and that burden is placed
on me.

377
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:05,120
Doing this I had to really think about why
was, why, why? Why was I here? Why am I doing

378
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:11,390
this? I was pretty religious at the time and
I went to talk to the chaplain and under the

379
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:18,210
orders of my commander actually and I got
nothing out of it. He was just basically like,

380
00:38:18,210 --> 00:38:24,900
"It's God's plan." It's God's fucking plan
for people to die? Like, I don't want to hear

381
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:27,390
that shit.
I didn't feel like I was a part of anything

382
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:35,650
good or wholesome or healthy or contributing
to the greater good. I felt like I was

383
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:47,960
Destroying myself. I was taking who I pictured myself
to be in my head and chopping it down, and

384
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:55,360
breaking it down, taking a sledgehammer to
it. And it crumbled.

385
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:24,540
My name is Rafiq ur Rehman.

386
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:30,240
I am a primary school teacher.

387
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:35,479
I've been teaching for ten years.

388
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:38,500
We strive to eradicate illiteracy

389
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:43,420
so our children can be educated and have a bright future.

390
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:46,340
This is my daughtetr Nabila.

391
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:49,100
This is my daughter Asma.

392
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:52,800
Zubair ur Rehman is my son.

393
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:55,780
We have our own land

394
00:39:55,780 --> 00:40:00,180
and grow our own food.

395
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:08,760
People enjoyed life before the attacks.

396
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:31,319
It was 2:45PM on October 24th of 2012.

397
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:36,188
After school finished I went into town to buy school supplies.

398
00:40:36,188 --> 00:40:42,800
After school finished I went into town to buy school supplies.

399
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,800
I was in the fields tying up bundles.

400
00:40:47,830 --> 00:40:52,100
I got back in the car and bought sweets for the children.

401
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:55,819
I got back in the car and bought sweets for the children.

402
00:40:55,820 --> 00:41:00,320
When I got home I was drinking tea,

403
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:04,820
after the first sip the drone hit.

404
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:14,340
The house shook

405
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:17,240
The dust flew.

406
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:20,479
The roof shook and the ground trembled.

407
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:27,300
I ran, then I got hit.

408
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:32,380
I ran out and there was all this dust and smoke.

409
00:41:32,387 --> 00:41:35,547
I was hit from behind and wounded.

410
00:41:35,547 --> 00:41:39,147
Then I ran to the house. I was bleeding and got bandaged.

411
00:41:39,147 --> 00:41:41,827
I knew there would be a second strike.

412
00:41:41,827 --> 00:41:53,427
Usually drones strike a second time after five or ten minutes.

413
00:41:53,427 --> 00:41:58,407
It's to kill the relatives who come out to help.

414
00:41:58,407 --> 00:42:01,980
Then five minutes later it came again.

415
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:12,800
Then I fell down right there, and I thought I was dying, and i was shouting I am dying.

416
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:20,960
The injured children had been taken to various hospitals for treatment.

417
00:42:55,180 --> 00:43:03,240
The attack was on October the 24th. I came from Islamabad and interviewed the family in clinic.

418
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:09,200
In general, the sense was of a family that had a very tramatic experience, they were very upset

419
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:29,720
These are the x-rays of the children who were hit by the drone

420
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:36,800
This is the x-ray of my nephew whose leg was broken in the attack.

421
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,760
They operated on him. These are the iron rods that they put in his legs.

422
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:54,800
When I reached the house, I saw my mother's sandal lying on the ground.

423
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:03,440
When I saw her sandal, I knew that she had died

424
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:13,979
Neighbors told me she had been thrown about twenty-five feet away.

425
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:17,780
That's when I saw my mother on the ground

426
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:22,340
and I ran towards her but the neighbors wouldn't let me near her.

427
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:25,200
They said you cannot see this.

428
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:31,800
She had so many wounds.

429
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:40,439
My mother was brutally killed.

430
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:44,620
That's where my mother was killed.

431
00:44:44,620 --> 00:44:47,700
She was, as the saying goes:

432
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:51,200
"like a treasure of prayers."

433
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:54,940
I used to discuss all my problems with her.

434
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:58,400
She used to console me and I would forget my worries.

435
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:04,620
My family has been destroyed since my mother was killed.

436
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:10,400
Atik and Rafiq whose mother had been killed in this attack

437
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:15,400
You know, obviously as anyone would be, they were angry and they were very upset

438
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:19,779
The blasts were very powerful.

439
00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:22,640
They have damaged the rooms badly.

440
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:25,560
This one's got cracks in it.

441
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:30,140
This needs to be fixed so it doesn't fall during the rains.

442
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:35,740
Before these attacks started there was peace and happiness in our area. 

443
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:41,500
When these drone attacks started and out mother was killed

444
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:48,100
they destroyed our entire family. They have wreaked havoc on our lives and happiness. 

445
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:04,320
You have people living in constant fear that they are not safe living in their own homes

446
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:06,160
or in their streets, or in their locality

447
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:16,399
They live in fear that they would be attacked, and they could die, or their children, or their property, or their land could be seriously effected. 

448
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:23,540
They buzz around twenty four hours a day, so I'm always scared, I cannon sleep.

449
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:30,440
We're scared all the time since they attacked us. How can we not be?

450
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:38,420
It has the worst effects on children when they see the dead or injured

451
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:45,320
The number of psychiatric patients has increased

452
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:48,180
The main reason for the increase is

453
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:52,500
that nobody feels safe in North Waziristan

454
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:59,720
I'm really afraid now, especially at night. I don't go out. I jump at every sound.

455
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:12,100
We thought that if we were not doing anything wrong

456
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:16,520
or associating with the wrong kind of people. no one will think we are terrorists

457
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:20,240
We have not seen terrorists but the radio reported that

458
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:25,600
terrorists were killed in the drone attack.

459
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:31,160
In the newspaper they say terrorists have died or Taliban have been killed

460
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:36,480
but it was small children who were attacked. 

461
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:43,160
Hundreds of civilians have died in the US drone strikes, the evidence is pretty clear on that

462
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:46,859
Unfortunately the US media doesn't seem to want to engage on that

463
00:47:46,860 --> 00:47:53,640
Our blood has been shed and my mother was killed and we are called terrorists.

464
00:47:53,780 --> 00:48:01,160
The news reports you often all you have to go on is a reference to two militants were killed or three militants were killed

465
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:04,000
And there's not a lot of evidence as to who those militants were

466
00:48:04,820 --> 00:48:11,000
US media outlets have been mindlessly reciting and regurgitating whatever statistic the government disseminates. 

467
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:18,339
They incorrectly report that terrorists have died

468
00:48:18,340 --> 00:48:26,800
that al-Qaeda has been killed. What they are doing wrong.

469
00:48:30,740 --> 00:48:36,919
I started gathering proof to show the real pictures to the world

470
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:46,100
I have taken pictures of the clothes and shoes covered in blood

471
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:48,819
because the American and Pakistan governments

472
00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:53,700
always report that they have killed terrorists in the drove attack

473
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:58,800
Later on we would learn that children, women, and the elderly

474
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:01,819
were also among the people killed.

475
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:14,720
Local people compare drone attacks with that of slapping someone in darkness

476
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:22,120
Drone strikes have turned all of Waziristan into enemies

477
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:25,380
We were not their enemy before the drone attack

478
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:29,680
but now they have made us their enemy by killing us with drones

479
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:36,340
I am angry at America and have become its enemy after the death of my mother

480
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:40,540
Thousands will become America's enemy after such incidents. 

481
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:48,300
We the people of Waziristan never pardon our enemies. - Jalal Manzar Khail

482
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:56,200
From their point of view, this is not war, this is murder, and that's the way they look at it. 

483
00:49:56,780 --> 00:50:03,780
It is recruiting terrorists all over the world, it is making young men and young women make the decision that the United States is their enemy

484
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:06,180
And therefore worthy of their Jihad

485
00:50:07,580 --> 00:50:14,980
We'll get revenge for our bloodshed and brutal killings. Sami Ullah

486
00:50:15,740 --> 00:50:22,740
The US had killed a large number of people. and yet at the same time instead of Al-Qaeda growing less in Yemen

487
00:50:22,740 --> 00:50:29,740
We're seeing in fact the exact opposite, that the more people we kill, it seems the larger infact that Al-Qaeda is growing

488
00:50:36,350 --> 00:50:42,274
Faisal Shahzad, he was a Pakistani National who engaged in the attempt to blow-up Times Square

489
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:51,820
The motivation that he put forward for his attack, was he had witnessed a series of drone strikes, so he was mounting an attack on a US city in retaliation.

490
00:50:58,820 --> 00:51:04,980
The Faisal Shahzad attack on Times Square is one example but there are other possibilities.

491
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:26,220
This jihadi attack will be the first of the revenge operations against the Americans and their drone teams. 

492
00:51:48,661 --> 00:51:52,581
The Taliban does not need to train suicide bombers anymore

493
00:51:52,581 --> 00:51:56,760
The drones create suicide bomber factories.

494
00:52:29,312 --> 00:52:36,312
Defense and aerospace firms which build drones have spent millions of dollars on lobbying over the past year.

495
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:41,940
It is estimated over the next decade, drones will become an $80 billion business.

496
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:47,160
50 countries are actively using drones, if we do it, why can't they

497
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:55,939
Now if anybody can develop drones and arm them, mind you there are a few out there who can, is gonna be able to do it and point it at us as the precedent and protocol. 

498
00:52:56,120 --> 00:53:04,299
Other countries will recognize the utility of drones as a means to attack their supposed enemies. 

499
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:08,240
Israel showed off its latest drone

500
00:53:17,163 --> 00:53:22,683
British government has spent some two billion pounds on developing attack drones

501
00:53:22,683 --> 00:53:27,903
And China is launching some new lineup to its old fleet of drones

502
00:53:27,903 --> 00:53:32,120
What if China starts using drones against what it regards as terrorists

503
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:47,359
The decisions we have made in the last few years will come back to haunt us

504
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:16,000
The drones are an excuse to avoid thinking seriously about what the United States should be doing to address Al-Qaeda or more broadly the threat posed by violent Islamic radicalism 

505
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:23,000
Well I have actually grown into spending much more time on community based solutions to these problems because they are just more effective

506
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:32,760
We've seen a lot of programs that have succeeded reducing violence and reducing militancy when the community gets involved

507
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:38,880
So what we need to do is demilitarize US Policy, in Washington that is sort of 

508
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:45,300
an unthinkable prospect because we've got
a National Security elite that is so much

509
00:54:45,370 --> 00:54:51,640
devoted to the assumption that military power
provides our strong suit. But the evidence

510
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:55,490
says otherwise.
We had a phrase we used in the State Department.

511
00:54:55,490 --> 00:55:01,370
We called it, "Drying up the Swamp". You know,
taking away the environment in which the terrorist

512
00:55:01,370 --> 00:55:05,759
flourishes. We're talking about helping people
rather than killing people. I'm talking about

513
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:09,660
a roof over their head; I'm talking about
a lasting cease-fire. I'm talking about clean

514
00:55:09,660 --> 00:55:13,920
water to drink.
The notion that somehow Al-Qaeda is the equivalent

515
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:20,920
of Nazi German or Imperial Japan is, is foolish.
It's time to recognize that that's not working

516
00:55:21,310 --> 00:55:28,310
and to look toward something else, like policing
and incorporating people into the political

517
00:55:28,790 --> 00:55:35,900
process, better programs at development that
will lift people out of poverty and give them

518
00:55:35,900 --> 00:55:38,540
alternatives.
If we win the people of tribal areas to our

519
00:55:38,540 --> 00:55:43,980
side, we win the war because they're strong
enough to take away, take care of the militants.

520
00:55:43,980 --> 00:55:50,570
The armed people in tribal area are almost
800,000 to 900,000. But these drones and Pakistani

521
00:55:50,570 --> 00:55:55,790
military operations are pushing these people
over to the militant side.

522
00:55:55,790 --> 00:56:02,330
It is clear that the present strategy to contain
this violence, to contain these militants,

523
00:56:02,330 --> 00:56:09,330
these terrible men of violence has not succeeded.
We need to stop letting our public servants

524
00:56:10,220 --> 00:56:20,560
be our public masters. My entire left side was injured because of the drone missile.

525
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:29,800
The drone hit our guest house and killed my two uncles and cousins.

526
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:35,299
I feel extreme pain and sometimes I pass out.

527
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:44,520
A lot of us came in as young, bright-eyed,
bushy-tailed, young, young people to becoming

528
00:56:45,530 --> 00:56:49,410
gloomy, negative individuals.

529
00:56:49,410 --> 00:56:55,290
September 7, 2009 three of my family members were killed and two of us were injured

530
00:56:55,570 --> 00:57:02,570
I felt like I deserved- If I contributed to
that many deaths, wouldn't it balance the

531
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:08,420
world out if I was to be a casualty myself?

532
00:57:08,460 --> 00:57:12,600
I was taken to the hospital for treatment where I spent many months.

533
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:16,440
They took my measurements and made me artificial legs.

534
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:29,600
I had…this ideal about myself where [CHUCKLES]
like, I wanted to do good; I wanted to save

535
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:34,140
people's lives. I wanted to, to, you know,
be a hero.

536
00:57:34,140 --> 00:57:41,400
I used to think that I would go to school and become a doctor.

537
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:43,680
But now I cannot do anything. 

538
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:47,940
They have cut off my legs and I have lost an eye. Now I cannot do anything. I just sit at home.

539
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:54,000
I had this, this oath that I swore that, um,

540
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:58,850
I felt I needed to follow because I gave my
word and the only thing that's worth anything

541
00:57:58,850 --> 00:58:01,690
in this world, is, is your word.

542
00:58:01,690 --> 00:58:09,850
I'm very hopeful that the drone attacks will stop and we'll have a normal life again.

543
00:58:24,180 --> 00:58:31,180
I had to get away as quickly as possible.

544
00:58:40,580 --> 00:58:43,299
I would like to give this message to Obama

545
00:58:43,300 --> 00:58:46,200
and people of America to stop drone attacks on Pakistan.

546
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:55,920
I give this message to Obama to stop drone attacks on us as soon as possible

547
00:58:55,920 --> 00:59:01,900
because it is extremely cruel.

548
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:04,920
It should be stopped sooner.

549
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:15,740
I would like to give message to Obama that please don't treat us on the basis of religion.

550
00:59:15,740 --> 00:59:19,479
but treat us on the basis of humanity. 

551
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:27,880
We all are human beings and have the same physical features. 

552
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:38,740
There are many people suffering here.

553
00:59:38,740 --> 00:59:42,600
We want the drones to be stopped.
