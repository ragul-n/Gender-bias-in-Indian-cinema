1
00:01:00,093 --> 00:01:02,061
This story belongs to the
fearless Pindaris (warriors)..

2
00:01:02,595 --> 00:01:04,062
..whose saga of
bravery was not considered..

3
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:06,389
..as a part of
history by the British.

4
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,762
But they could not stop
them from becoming a legend.

5
00:01:10,637 --> 00:01:13,765
"The wind carries the messages."

6
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:17,075
"The wind carries the messages."

7
00:01:17,477 --> 00:01:20,605
"Don't write your
messages on the leaves."

8
00:01:20,814 --> 00:01:23,840
"Don't write your
messages on the leaves."

9
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:27,511
"When these messages
reach foreign land..

10
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,780
"..they'll cause only grief."

11
00:01:31,157 --> 00:01:34,456
"When these messages
reach foreign land..

12
00:01:34,661 --> 00:01:37,459
"..they'll cause only grief."

13
00:01:37,664 --> 00:01:45,799
"Krishna.."

14
00:01:52,512 --> 00:01:54,343
All passengers travelling to Madhavgarh,
Shyamgarh, Ratanpur...

15
00:01:54,547 --> 00:01:56,515
please get down here.

16
00:01:56,716 --> 00:01:59,276
All passengers travelling to Madhavgarh,
Shyamgarh, Ratanpur...

17
00:01:59,486 --> 00:02:01,511
please get down here.

18
00:02:01,721 --> 00:02:03,689
All passengers travelling to Madhavgarh,
Shyamgarh, Ratanpur...

19
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:05,687
please get down here.

20
00:02:12,565 --> 00:02:16,695
'Justice. Fraternity. Equality.'

21
00:02:17,403 --> 00:02:24,468
'That's why the sun never
sets on the British Empire.'

22
00:02:25,245 --> 00:02:27,873
Are you from London Times?
- Yes, London Times.

23
00:02:28,248 --> 00:02:33,208
Ram Singh, you've been with king
Prithvi Singh for a long time. - Yes.

24
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:34,386
Tell me something.

25
00:02:34,587 --> 00:02:38,387
At a time when the entire
country is following Gandhi..

26
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:40,752
Everyone talks about non-violence..

27
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:44,259
..but Your Highness Prithvi Singh..

28
00:02:44,464 --> 00:02:46,261
..is preaching violence.

29
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:46,932
Why?

30
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:49,262
And why does he hate us so much?

31
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:52,370
Why doesn't he have
faith in the British Empire?

32
00:02:57,477 --> 00:02:58,774
Faith.

33
00:03:00,713 --> 00:03:03,375
Faith leads to betrayal.

34
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:17,261
'Year 1862, when Chandangarh
attacked Madhavgarh.'

35
00:04:16,556 --> 00:04:20,014
Hail the prince.
We can't wait any longer.

36
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:23,693
Chandangarh's army is
overpowering our army.

37
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:26,932
Order the reserve troops
to march forward.

38
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:30,302
It's not necessary that wars
are always won with might.

39
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,304
They'll be here soon.

40
00:04:34,974 --> 00:04:37,943
You're putting the lives of your troops
at stake for those Pindaris

41
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:39,778
They must be drunk with their local brew..

42
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:41,310
..and must be wading in a pile of muck.

43
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:42,778
Though you know that Pindaris..

44
00:04:42,982 --> 00:04:48,443
..are men of their word,
you still do not believe that they..

45
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:10,833
These inebriated Pindaris might be..

46
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:13,672
..Ioudmouths and uncivilised.

47
00:05:14,414 --> 00:05:17,508
But once they are astride their
horses wielding their swords..

48
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,583
Now, the reserve force
will be useful to us.

49
00:05:56,289 --> 00:06:00,521
Chief. The crown prince has invited you
for a drink to celebrate the victory.

50
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:03,626
The chief of Pindaris Hyder Ali..

51
00:06:05,765 --> 00:06:07,630
..only drinks with the kings.

52
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:11,466
Prithvi.
- Yes, Chief.

53
00:06:11,671 --> 00:06:12,330
Go.

54
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:13,631
Magan, Chaman.
- Yes, Chief.

55
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,467
Naunihal. - Yes, Chief.
- Bhairav. - Yes.

56
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:16,642
All of you go along with him.

57
00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:18,467
And get our lands back from him.
- Come on

58
00:06:18,678 --> 00:06:21,806
Victory be to Guru's Khalsa.

59
00:06:22,014 --> 00:06:23,345
Chief..
- Calm down.

60
00:06:23,516 --> 00:06:24,483
It needs to be dealt with calmly.

61
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:39,387
Didn't Hyder Ali come along?

62
00:06:46,005 --> 00:06:50,942
Prince, even your
father king Sangram Singh..

63
00:06:51,844 --> 00:06:57,874
..wouldn't address Pindari
chief Hyder Ali by just his name.

64
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:02,486
Save your attitude for the enemies.

65
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:08,549
At the moment, I want to
conquer the entire province.

66
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:13,929
Of course. But we made a
pact only for this battle.

67
00:07:14,634 --> 00:07:15,931
And, in return, you

68
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:21,471
..return us our lands.
- I surely will.

69
00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:23,671
But first, let me
introduce you to my friends.

70
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,588
Your father said that the British..

71
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,785
..are in favour of Chandangarh.

72
00:07:46,999 --> 00:07:49,797
Prithvi. Prithvi. Prithvi.

73
00:07:50,102 --> 00:07:53,970
This is politics,
and it's beyond your knowledge.

74
00:07:54,373 --> 00:07:56,341
You just enjoy the English liquor.

75
00:07:57,543 --> 00:07:58,373
Bring it forth.

76
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:06,551
We drink only the
blood of these British.

77
00:08:06,853 --> 00:08:10,653
What era are you living in, Prithvi?

78
00:08:17,396 --> 00:08:20,365
We should only befriend the rulers of
half the world

79
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,827
..and not take up enmities.

80
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:24,498
Prince..
- Naunihal!

81
00:08:30,376 --> 00:08:31,308
Are you done?

82
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:38,374
Return us our lands,
and get lost from here.

83
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:44,246
Land? Where do you want your lands?

84
00:08:46,592 --> 00:08:47,616
There?

85
00:08:48,594 --> 00:08:51,256
Do you want it there? There?

86
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:52,657
There?

87
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:56,735
Or below the stairs of our palace?

88
00:08:57,403 --> 00:08:58,893
Where you'll always get
to witness my progress..

89
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:02,274
..even after you're dead.

90
00:09:02,608 --> 00:09:05,270
And as far as your
companions are concerned..

91
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:07,643
Take a look.

92
00:09:15,588 --> 00:09:17,180
Treachery.

93
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,933
Prithvi, we'll deal with them later.

94
00:09:29,368 --> 00:09:30,960
We need to save our
Pindari brothers first.

95
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:32,803
Let's get down there. Quickly.

96
00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:09,265
Fire.

97
00:10:13,045 --> 00:10:14,876
Kill them.

98
00:10:15,047 --> 00:10:17,709
Prithvi, get out of here. Be quick.

99
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:20,408
But Chief.. - Go. Don't think.
Go. We've been deceived.

100
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,317
Don't let them escape.

101
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:33,899
Hail Lord Shiva.

102
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:35,726
Come on.

103
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:10,199
It is our mistake.
We trusted the wrong man.

104
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:11,664
The king.

105
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:15,469
I'm the only one
entitled to be punished.

106
00:11:19,578 --> 00:11:21,944
That's why I've decided..
- What've you decided, Chief?

107
00:11:23,582 --> 00:11:25,846
Haven't we lost enough men..

108
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,214
..that we should lose another one?

109
00:11:30,956 --> 00:11:34,619
We'll leave our homes.
Burn down our fields.

110
00:11:35,594 --> 00:11:36,754
We'll spread in different directions..

111
00:11:36,996 --> 00:11:41,490
..as rebellious farmers and warriors.

112
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,862
And then we won't just get our lands back

113
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:46,733
..but drive the king
and the British out..

114
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:50,342
..and conquer Madhavgarh.

115
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:52,270
We won't drive them out!

116
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:55,674
We'll behead them.

117
00:11:58,851 --> 00:12:02,685
Because we'll avenge the
death of 4500 Pindaris..

118
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:06,286
..by massacring that rogue king..

119
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:10,622
..and each of his British friends.

120
00:12:19,805 --> 00:12:21,466
Then I give you my word.

121
00:12:26,812 --> 00:12:30,646
I'll behead the king and
each of his British friends.

122
00:12:33,652 --> 00:12:35,085
Or die myself in the effort.

123
00:12:42,394 --> 00:12:45,363
"The wind carries the messages."

124
00:12:45,564 --> 00:12:48,533
"The wind carries the messages."

125
00:12:49,001 --> 00:12:51,993
"Don't write your messages on the leaves."

126
00:12:52,404 --> 00:12:55,532
"Don't write your messages on the leaves."

127
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:59,003
"When these messages reach foreign land..

128
00:12:59,411 --> 00:13:01,936
"..they'll cause only grief."

129
00:13:02,748 --> 00:13:05,842
"When these messages reach foreign land..

130
00:13:06,051 --> 00:13:09,384
"..they'll cause only grief."

131
00:13:09,588 --> 00:13:12,022
"Krishna.."

132
00:13:12,424 --> 00:13:17,418
Prithvi, our power was unmatched.
But what could we do?

133
00:13:18,898 --> 00:13:19,830
No, Prithvi.

134
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:22,491
We're illiterates
and ignorant people.

135
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:27,530
How will we ever think
cunningly like the British?

136
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:35,073
It's a boy.

137
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:37,914
Congratulations, Chief.
- Congratulations, Chief.

138
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:54,460
Chief, it's raining.
The child will get drenched.

139
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:55,793
Where are you going?

140
00:13:56,602 --> 00:13:57,626
He has to keep going.

141
00:13:59,972 --> 00:14:01,098
He has to keep going.

142
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:04,505
He has to travel a great distance.

143
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:10,515
He's my Veer. Rain or
storm holds no meaning for him.

144
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:11,675
Veer.

145
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,848
Veer. My Veer.

146
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:38,640
Get up, Veer.

147
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:50,055
Father, watch my move now.

148
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,356
Oh, God.- Pick him up!

149
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:58,359
Oh, he's picked me up.

150
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,691
Come on, Veer.

151
00:15:15,981 --> 00:15:19,815
Father, one day, I'll
throw you in the water as well.

152
00:15:19,985 --> 00:15:21,384
Bravo.

153
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:28,786
Veer, learn to control your anger.

154
00:15:30,796 --> 00:15:33,424
The future expects a lot from you.

155
00:15:47,746 --> 00:15:49,270
Look out, Veer.

156
00:16:49,274 --> 00:16:50,400
Pindaris are coming.

157
00:16:50,609 --> 00:16:52,236
Prepare to fire.

158
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:04,781
Princess. The Pindaris are here
to loot the train.

159
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:05,616
Let's go.

160
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:15,792
The dacoits are here.
Put in some more coal.

161
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:05,482
Bravo, Veer.

162
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:28,895
Go, Veer.

163
00:19:29,568 --> 00:19:30,796
Lousy Pindari.

164
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:42,540
Whichever part I get hold off,
I rip off five kilos of flesh.

165
00:19:43,582 --> 00:19:46,380
Tell me.. treasure.. India.

166
00:19:46,585 --> 00:19:47,882
From here to London.

167
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:49,887
There is no treasure.

168
00:20:13,078 --> 00:20:14,705
Veer, there's a
royal coach here as well.

169
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:35,864
No, there isn't anyone here.

170
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:37,592
There's no treasure here.

171
00:20:37,803 --> 00:20:38,792
This is the ladies coach.

172
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:39,868
There's no one here.

173
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,464
I've heard that the Pindaris..

174
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:46,469
..always protect women and children.

175
00:20:46,678 --> 00:20:47,645
There's only the princess here.

176
00:20:47,846 --> 00:20:49,074
I swear on Lord Ram.

177
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:37,458
Let's go.

178
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:44,030
Listen. Take this jewellery.

Go tell father that
he can go ahead, and..

00:41:24,215 --> 00:41:30,176
"Come see me beyond
the restrictions of time."

353
00:41:30,421 --> 00:41:33,515
"Beyond the restrictions of time."

354
00:41:33,724 --> 00:41:37,125
"Come, and see me."

355
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:41,731
"Try to understand what
my eyes try to convey."

356
00:41:42,366 --> 00:41:48,396
"Every time I look into
your eyes, I see my paradise."

357
00:41:48,606 --> 00:41:54,511
"The stars are shining bright up in
the sky, painting words of desire."

358
00:41:54,712 --> 00:41:57,408
"Can this be real?"

359
00:41:57,615 --> 00:42:00,516
"Are you the one for me?"

360
00:42:00,718 --> 00:42:07,248
"You've captured my heart,
my soul, my love."

361
00:42:07,424 --> 00:42:12,862
"You're the one I'm waiting for."

362
00:42:13,931 --> 00:42:20,268
"Every time I look into
your eyes, I see my paradise."

363
00:42:20,437 --> 00:42:28,674
"The stars are shining bright up in
the sky, painting words of desire."

364
00:42:40,491 --> 00:42:46,191
"You were peeking
from the corners."

365
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:52,826
"From behind the moon."

366
00:42:56,607 --> 00:43:01,670
"You were peeking
from the corners."

367
00:43:02,613 --> 00:43:08,381
"From behind the moon."

368
00:43:08,886 --> 00:43:12,219
"l searched the entire world."

369
00:43:12,389 --> 00:43:15,483
"But didn't look in the eyes."

370
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:21,322
"You were right in front of me."

371
00:43:21,532 --> 00:43:24,228
"Let's soar away."

372
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:27,302
"Beyond the restrictions of time."

373
00:43:27,471 --> 00:43:30,702
"Beyond the restrictions of time."

374
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:34,339
"Let's soar away."

375
00:43:34,545 --> 00:43:38,606
"Try to understand what
my eyes try to convey."

376
00:43:46,857 --> 00:43:49,724
"Oh, charming eyes."

377
00:43:49,927 --> 00:43:54,762
"I've heard that your eyes.."
- Wow.

378
00:44:01,705 --> 00:44:05,732
London is absolutely stunning,
Veer. Everyone knows English here.

379
00:44:06,143 --> 00:44:08,577
The same as everyone
knows Hindi in lndia.

380
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:27,661
Stand properly.

381
00:44:28,866 --> 00:44:29,890
Attention.

382
00:44:30,901 --> 00:44:32,198
Quiet.

383
00:44:36,874 --> 00:44:38,273
All right, sit.

384
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:43,670
Do you know what is
good about London?

385
00:44:43,881 --> 00:44:46,679
There's no dirt even on the streets.

386
00:44:48,485 --> 00:44:51,511
Not a single one of
deserves to be here.

387
00:44:51,722 --> 00:44:53,155
But thanks to Lord Macaulay..

388
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:55,291
..and his new education policy.

389
00:44:55,492 --> 00:44:58,325
And the kindness of
Her Majesty, the queen..

390
00:44:58,729 --> 00:45:00,219
..you are here.

391
00:45:00,564 --> 00:45:04,660
They think that barbaric and
uncivilised natives like you..

392
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:06,836
..can be transformed.

393
00:45:07,604 --> 00:45:09,435
I don't agree.

394
00:45:10,474 --> 00:45:13,671
But now is your chance
to prove me wrong.

395
00:45:15,479 --> 00:45:17,572
Now, these tribal clothes,
the tribal haircuts..

396
00:45:18,482 --> 00:45:19,210
..won't work here.

397
00:45:19,416 --> 00:45:20,747
I don't want the
British and royal students..

398
00:45:20,951 --> 00:45:23,249
..to feel uncomfortable,
because of you.

399
00:45:24,288 --> 00:45:25,915
So, everything has been
arranged on the campus..

400
00:45:26,323 --> 00:45:27,915
..to make you men.

401
00:45:33,997 --> 00:45:40,368
Sir, clothes don't make a man.

402
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:43,836
Man makes clothes.

403
00:45:45,809 --> 00:45:46,776
Something like that..

404
00:45:46,977 --> 00:45:48,467
Something like that was quoted..

405
00:45:49,713 --> 00:45:52,580
..by your Lord Bernard Shaw.

406
00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:00,716
Don't you get smart with me, son.

407
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:03,784
You people call yourself men.

408
00:46:03,994 --> 00:46:06,326
I've seen how you live.

409
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:08,891
I've seen your lndia.

410
00:46:09,299 --> 00:46:11,961
How you people live,
the way your country is.

411
00:46:12,369 --> 00:46:13,859
Sweat. Smell.

412
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:16,466
Dirt. Filth. Muck.

413
00:46:16,673 --> 00:46:21,372
Flies, lousy pigs, cows..
everywhere.

414
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:24,410
Dirt. Dirt. Dirt.

415
00:46:25,415 --> 00:46:26,473
Hey, Teacher.

416
00:46:31,722 --> 00:46:32,848
Punya, hold on to this.

417
00:46:34,792 --> 00:46:41,595
If our country is so dirty..
filled with dirt, filth and muck..

418
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:45,963
..cows, buffaloes, flies,
smell and sweat..

419
00:46:47,337 --> 00:46:53,003
..then what've you been
doing for the past 140 years?

420
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:54,444
Cleaning up?

421
00:46:56,313 --> 00:46:58,645
My father sent me here to study.

422
00:46:59,283 --> 00:47:00,545
Only to study.

423
00:47:01,585 --> 00:47:05,146
Otherwise, I would've taught
you today.

424
00:47:07,758 --> 00:47:13,458
Rogues, you betray your
own benefactor.

425
00:47:15,399 --> 00:47:17,697
Don't talk about my motherland.

426
00:47:18,235 --> 00:47:21,466
Don't talk about my country.

427
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:32,979
Four sticks.

428
00:47:35,786 --> 00:47:37,617
The punishment will commence..

429
00:47:38,021 --> 00:47:42,321
..and will not cease
until four sticks are broken.

430
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:45,289
Your hands on the table please.

431
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:20,688
Great, Mr. Gajendra.
What a shot!

432
00:49:21,091 --> 00:49:23,321
You're a good player
as well, Sujan Singh.

433
00:49:23,527 --> 00:49:25,392
So, what were you saying,
Yashodhara?

434
00:49:25,696 --> 00:49:26,628
Brother, I've found out..

435
00:49:27,030 --> 00:49:29,123
..that the boy
wasn't at fault at all.

436
00:49:29,366 --> 00:49:31,231
The management was
unfair to him.

437
00:49:31,501 --> 00:49:33,093
We should talk to them.

438
00:49:34,271 --> 00:49:37,206
Yasho, why are you like this?

439
00:49:38,342 --> 00:49:41,675
Just because a barbarian returned
to you a piece of your brooch..

440
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:44,445
..you feel these
barbarians have a heart.

441
00:49:44,614 --> 00:49:46,411
You're right, Gajendra Singh.

442
00:49:47,184 --> 00:49:48,412
You absolutely right.

443
00:49:49,453 --> 00:49:51,546
It's the generosity of the British..

444
00:49:51,755 --> 00:49:54,223
..that they just publicly
caned him and let him go.

445
00:49:54,758 --> 00:49:56,123
Had it been Ratangarh..

446
00:49:56,326 --> 00:50:00,319
No, no. Expelling him is not
the right thing to do here.

447
00:50:00,530 --> 00:50:03,693
We're not running a school,
we're running a country.

448
00:50:04,101 --> 00:50:07,400
But, my lord. I smell of
revolution in all of them.

449
00:50:08,538 --> 00:50:10,130
We've come here today..

450
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:13,673
..to request you to call off
this new education policy.

451
00:50:14,311 --> 00:50:18,145
My dear principal, we entice
these barbaric fools here..

452
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:19,576
..to educate them.

453
00:50:19,783 --> 00:50:23,617
Mislead them into our way
of thinking and our culture.

454
00:50:24,054 --> 00:50:26,716
Get them indebted by
doing small favours.

455
00:50:27,524 --> 00:50:32,484
Enslave them, rule them and
rule their country forever.

456
00:50:34,331 --> 00:50:38,563
This is the beginning of
a new England in lndia.

457
00:50:40,437 --> 00:50:43,600
In fact, my friends,
it's the end of lndia.

458
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:51,477
These British are absolutely right.

459
00:50:53,817 --> 00:50:57,184
Our country is filled

460
00:50:59,756 --> 00:51:01,485
But what's the reason behind it?

461
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:07,390
The reason is that all
the kings aren't united.

462
00:51:08,665 --> 00:51:09,723
Whose fault is it?

463
00:51:10,801 --> 00:51:14,635
Ours or the British?

464
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:20,710
Initially, only 187
British came to our country.

465
00:51:22,279 --> 00:51:23,507
Then 2000.

466
00:51:24,548 --> 00:51:25,708
Then 10000.

467
00:51:26,783 --> 00:51:28,273
And then 100,000.

468
00:51:28,852 --> 00:51:30,752
And these 100,000 British..

469
00:51:32,155 --> 00:51:34,555
..ruled over 300 million lndians.

470
00:51:35,692 --> 00:51:36,818
'Do you know how?'

471
00:51:39,362 --> 00:51:42,354
'Father, because they
only know how to divide us.'

472
00:51:42,799 --> 00:51:47,361
'Under the pretext of hunger,
greed, language.'

473
00:51:48,805 --> 00:51:51,638
'And we know only how to
form different sects.'

474
00:51:52,275 --> 00:51:58,373
'ln the name of religion,
caste, kingdom and the king.'

475
00:51:59,783 --> 00:52:00,841
'And you know, Father..'

476
00:52:01,251 --> 00:52:05,585
'..there's a ruse behind
their education policy as well.'

477
00:52:09,759 --> 00:52:13,354
'They want to corrupt our
minds with British culture.

478
00:52:13,864 --> 00:52:17,823
To know their thinking, and
their cunningness better..

479
00:52:18,401 --> 00:52:21,893
..we brothers have slightly
adapted ourselves like them.

480
00:52:22,405 --> 00:52:23,531
Bless me.

481
00:52:25,442 --> 00:52:27,433
Veer.
- Yes.

482
00:52:27,644 --> 00:52:28,906
Don't forget to write to father..

483
00:52:29,546 --> 00:52:33,812
..that you've fallen in
love with London. - Fine.

484
00:52:34,551 --> 00:52:35,643
I will.

485
00:52:40,557 --> 00:52:46,553
"It's got to be..
got to be the world."

486
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:51,290
"It's got to be..
got to be the world."

487
00:52:51,501 --> 00:52:54,163
Veer, this is a royal party.

488
00:52:54,371 --> 00:52:55,804
You've bright chances
of meeting her here.

489
00:52:56,206 --> 00:52:59,334
Don't be scared.
I'm with you, okay.

490
00:53:01,978 --> 00:53:02,774
Where are you going?

491
00:53:02,979 --> 00:53:04,674
Remember what father said.

492
00:53:05,448 --> 00:53:06,779
To understand these British..

493
00:53:07,284 --> 00:53:09,616
..it's important for me to
understand the British ladies.

494
00:53:11,655 --> 00:53:12,553
Attention.

495
00:53:13,256 --> 00:53:14,188
Hello, girls.
- Hello.

496
00:53:14,391 --> 00:53:16,621
How are you doing?
- Good, how are you?

497
00:53:31,808 --> 00:53:33,298
That's funny..
- Yasho.

498
00:53:33,510 --> 00:53:34,374
What?
- Look.

499
00:53:56,399 --> 00:53:58,890
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

500
00:54:03,306 --> 00:54:05,672
Assume that she gets trapped if
she smiles. - What's he doing?

501
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:10,736
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

502
00:54:14,851 --> 00:54:15,579
Yes.

503
00:54:18,722 --> 00:54:22,123
I want to talk to Yashodhara,
and not you.

504
00:54:22,425 --> 00:54:27,863
Don't you have any manners
or shame?

505
00:54:28,365 --> 00:54:30,299
Just because you
travelled to a foreign land..

506
00:54:30,667 --> 00:54:31,656
..you forgot the difference.

507
00:54:31,868 --> 00:54:34,564
God knows what these
British saw in them..

508
00:54:34,804 --> 00:54:38,501
..that they let them
come to the royal club.

509
00:54:39,209 --> 00:54:41,507
We know what these
British saw in us.

510
00:54:42,412 --> 00:54:45,643
But you were born to rule.

511
00:54:46,516 --> 00:54:49,451
So, what did you see
in these British..

512
00:54:49,653 --> 00:54:51,587
..that you let them enslave you?

513
00:54:58,261 --> 00:55:00,422
Hey, come here.

514
00:55:01,564 --> 00:55:02,496
Yes, My Lord.

515
00:55:02,699 --> 00:55:03,723
Slaves?

516
00:55:04,567 --> 00:55:05,591
Take a look.

517
00:55:05,835 --> 00:55:07,530
This is how they stand before us.

518
00:55:07,904 --> 00:55:10,429
Brother.
- He was calling us a slave.

519
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:12,904
Brother?
- He was just joking..

520
00:55:13,276 --> 00:55:16,575
Brother, don't get so angry.

521
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:18,839
It was only a trivial joke.

522
00:55:20,750 --> 00:55:22,581
Joke?
- Yes.

523
00:55:22,786 --> 00:55:24,413
Allow me to crack a
trivial joke as well.

524
00:55:24,621 --> 00:55:25,815
Of course.
- Come.

525
00:55:26,022 --> 00:55:27,853
Thank you.
Thank you.

526
00:55:28,258 --> 00:55:29,225
Thank you.

527
00:55:54,851 --> 00:55:58,252
Veer, love isn't your
cup of tea. Forget it.

528
00:55:58,455 --> 00:56:00,355
Why do you want to
get yourself killed?

529
00:56:00,557 --> 00:56:01,524
Careful.

530
00:56:01,725 --> 00:56:03,852
You've been lying on this
bed for the past ten days.

531
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:05,625
You still have three months to go.

532
00:56:05,829 --> 00:56:09,356
Your love story has come to an end.

533
00:56:12,669 --> 00:56:13,499
What?

534
00:56:14,337 --> 00:56:15,827
Give me the shoes.
- Shoes?

535
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:16,971
You couldn't even wear your socks.

536
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:17,965
You think you can wear the shoes.

537
00:56:18,341 --> 00:56:21,469
Here, wear them. Wear it.
- Chest. Chest. - What?

538
00:56:21,678 --> 00:56:23,373
Place it on the chest.
- On the chest.

539
00:56:23,813 --> 00:56:26,646
Here. Here.

540
00:56:26,850 --> 00:56:30,980
Shall I push harder?
Shall I push harder?

541
00:56:38,361 --> 00:56:38,918
Sorry..

542
00:56:40,497 --> 00:56:41,657
What are you saying?

543
00:56:45,769 --> 00:56:48,863
I don't understand English and you
are talking in some other language.

544
00:57:06,423 --> 00:57:07,617
Where is she?

545
00:57:10,727 --> 00:57:12,922
Did you see her hat?
- What hat?

546
00:57:14,731 --> 00:57:16,289
Yes, I think I did.

547
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:18,658
It was quite weird.

548
00:57:20,403 --> 00:57:21,563
Mr. Veer Pratap.

549
00:57:23,773 --> 00:57:24,933
Yashodhara.

550
00:57:27,377 --> 00:57:28,435
Carefully.
- Yes

551
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:31,444
Excuse me.

552
00:57:31,681 --> 00:57:32,739
Have you started studying..

553
00:57:32,949 --> 00:57:36,350
How is your leg now?
- It's better now.

554
00:57:38,488 --> 00:57:42,390
So, have you forgiven my brother?
- No.

555
00:57:44,494 --> 00:57:46,894
Actually, you tend to get
hurt in games.

556
00:57:47,363 --> 00:57:48,625
It's not his fault.

557
00:57:50,533 --> 00:57:51,363
Thank you.

558
00:57:51,534 --> 00:57:54,765
Thank you? What for?

559
00:57:55,638 --> 00:57:56,935
I'm grateful to you.

560
00:58:00,977 --> 00:58:03,468
Take care of your leg.
- Of course.

561
00:58:03,746 --> 00:58:07,944
Listen. Look after yourself.
- Yes.

562
00:58:09,886 --> 00:58:12,480
You will, won't you?
- Yes

563
00:58:53,763 --> 00:58:57,665
And now, a folk dance
from Czechoslovakia.

564
00:58:58,067 --> 00:59:03,232
Lady. Lady, that can
wait for a while. Please.

565
00:59:03,306 --> 00:59:05,297
Let us entertain ourselves.

566
00:59:05,508 --> 00:59:09,501
For now..
Veer will perform for lndia.

567
00:59:13,883 --> 00:59:15,145
Sorry folks.

568
00:59:15,318 --> 00:59:18,583
And now,
Veer will perform for lndia.

569
00:59:22,659 --> 00:59:24,820
Only Veer can perform for lndia.

570
01:00:15,111 --> 01:00:19,548
Gajendra Singh, thank you very much
for this favour once again.

571
01:00:21,718 --> 01:00:24,778
Do you want to double
the entertainment? - Yes.

572
01:00:25,188 --> 01:00:27,622
Then I want an lndian partner
to dance with me.

573
01:00:29,359 --> 01:00:31,793
Yes. Yes.

574
01:00:32,228 --> 01:00:33,525
Come on.
- Yes.

575
01:00:33,730 --> 01:00:36,631
Yashodhara, I believe you sing
and dance very well.

576
01:00:36,833 --> 01:00:39,358
Would you be kind enough
to join my brother on stage?

577
01:00:40,637 --> 01:00:44,266
How can l?
- Yes, yes.- No.

578
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:46,533
Hold on. Hold on.

She cannot dance like a commoner.
After all, she's a royal.

580
01:00:51,581 --> 01:00:53,242
And we royals have a protocol.

581
01:00:54,851 --> 01:00:56,113
I'm sorry.

582
01:00:56,619 --> 01:00:58,348
We all understand protocols.

583
01:00:59,422 --> 01:01:03,153
But music doesn't
understand any protocol.

584
01:01:04,727 --> 01:01:08,720
So, everyone hold
on to their hearts.

585
01:01:09,132 --> 01:01:11,623
Otherwise, my voice
might stir up your hearts.

586
01:01:12,201 --> 01:01:15,466
And royalty is compelled
to dance with commoners.

587
01:01:17,273 --> 01:01:20,299
So, shall we begin?
- Yes.

Protocol.

635
01:06:15,972 --> 01:06:16,961
I don't know.

You thought, if you dance with me
then I'll dance vigorously.

637

And my leg will be
injured more seriously.

Your Highness, I hope you

My love. Long time.

644
01:08:07,483 --> 01:08:08,677
Anything special.

645

I'll talk to you about it later.

What about the Pindaris?

647
01:08:16,992 --> 01:08:21,292
They plunder in one state
and escape to another.

648
01:08:21,497 --> 01:08:23,692
It's very difficult to catch them.

649
01:08:25,334 --> 01:08:27,734
I think we'll need to get
all the six kings together.

Greetings, king.

651
01:08:29,338 --> 01:08:31,499
Unite and fight them back.

Father, I want you to
meet someone special.

655
01:08:40,883 --> 01:08:41,872
He's here.

656
01:08:43,018 --> 01:08:45,714
Ask him to take a seat.
- Yes.

657
01:08:47,389 --> 01:08:49,448
Like I was saying, my son..

658
01:09:01,070 --> 01:09:02,435
He's there.

659
01:09:30,466 --> 01:09:31,728
What are you doing?

660
01:09:32,501 --> 01:09:33,991
All the guests here are rich.

661
01:09:34,436 --> 01:09:38,839
And I knew that you won't dance
with me here in front of everyone.

662
01:09:40,009 --> 01:09:40,976
That's right.

663
01:09:41,377 --> 01:09:43,902
We can't break the Protocol.

664
01:09:46,015 --> 01:09:48,745
And I can't get my legs
broken everyday as well.

665
01:09:51,754 --> 01:09:53,847
If breaking can unite someone..

666
01:09:54,990 --> 01:09:56,787
..then is it really called breaking?

667
01:10:25,854 --> 01:10:27,981
So, why does your father
want to see me?

668
01:10:28,857 --> 01:10:31,758
Because he's the king?

669
01:10:32,828 --> 01:10:36,059
Which is his kingdom? Shikarpur?
- No.

670
01:10:36,465 --> 01:10:37,591
He's the king of..

671
01:10:41,570 --> 01:10:42,662
Madhavgarh.

672
01:11:10,966 --> 01:11:12,661
He's here to see the queen.

673
01:11:12,868 --> 01:11:16,827
This time around, he'll make all
arrangements to annihilate the Pindaris.

674
01:11:17,473 --> 01:11:19,941
You know, Veer,
they're barbaric.

675
01:11:20,142 --> 01:11:23,578
Once, they looted the
train I was travelling in.

676
01:11:24,179 --> 01:11:29,913
Did they harm you?
- No. They severed father's hand.

677
01:11:30,452 --> 01:11:33,148
Thank God, his head
wasn't severed.

678
01:11:36,125 --> 01:11:38,457
I heard that he deceitfully..

679
01:11:38,861 --> 01:11:41,022
..Ied thousands of
Pindaris to their death.

680
01:11:41,797 --> 01:11:42,923
That's wrong.

681
01:11:43,198 --> 01:11:45,462
We just want to make them civilised.

682
01:11:47,670 --> 01:11:50,867
By throwing them out of their houses.

683
01:11:51,774 --> 01:11:53,935
The Pindaris have only one motive.

684
01:11:55,110 --> 01:11:56,077
Independence.

685
01:11:57,880 --> 01:11:59,643
How can you say that?

686
01:13:00,509 --> 01:13:02,340
Princess of Madhavgarh.

687
01:13:06,515 --> 01:13:08,346

Veer.

689
01:13:57,766 --> 01:13:59,427
You have to leave, Veer.

690
01:13:59,968 --> 01:14:02,402
Brother has found
out who you really are.

691
01:14:03,005 --> 01:14:04,973
He's gone to the hostel to look for you.

692
01:14:10,479 --> 01:14:11,673
Punya.

693
01:14:59,027 --> 01:15:00,756
Pindari.

694
01:15:04,466 --> 01:15:06,934
How dare you?

695
01:15:08,604 --> 01:15:10,504
Tried to mingle with the likes of us.

696
01:15:10,706 --> 01:15:12,765
And with my sister..

697
01:15:19,982 --> 01:15:21,006
Idiot.

698
01:15:27,556 --> 01:15:33,722
It's rightly said, sons have to fulfill
their father's incomplete deeds.

699
01:15:36,798 --> 01:15:38,356
Where is your brother?

700
01:15:39,768 --> 01:15:43,363
Thankfully, he isn't here.

701
01:16:21,043 --> 01:16:22,772
Whichever part I get hold of..

702
01:16:24,746 --> 01:16:27,146
..I'll rip off five kilos of flesh.

703
01:17:24,039 --> 01:17:25,006
Veer.

704
01:17:41,823 --> 01:17:42,790
Veer.

705
01:17:48,964 --> 01:17:50,090
Let him go.

706
01:17:52,968 --> 01:17:53,866
Let him go.

707
01:17:56,004 --> 01:17:58,632
Forgive him, Veer.
- No.

708
01:17:58,807 --> 01:18:01,071
He's Yashodhara's brother.

709
01:18:01,276 --> 01:18:04,905
We don't have any enmity
with him, but his father.

710
01:18:05,113 --> 01:18:08,014
We do! We do! We do!

711
01:18:08,216 --> 01:18:10,912
We do! We do!

712
01:18:11,119 --> 01:18:17,024
We do! We do!

713
01:18:45,454 --> 01:18:46,978
Brother, no!

714
01:19:06,374 --> 01:19:08,205
No, no.

715
01:19:16,752 --> 01:19:17,980
Go away from here.

716
01:19:18,687 --> 01:19:21,679
Go, Veer. Go from here.

717
01:19:25,127 --> 01:19:26,526
Promise me, Veer.

718
01:19:26,695 --> 01:19:28,686
You won't ever come to Madhavgarh.

719
01:19:30,532 --> 01:19:31,760
I promise..

720
01:19:34,836 --> 01:19:36,929
That I will come to Madhavgarh.

721
01:19:40,142 --> 01:19:41,973
With father's permission..

722
01:19:43,578 --> 01:19:48,106
I will marry you
amidst the fire or..

723
01:19:49,718 --> 01:19:51,879
..I will torch Madhavgarh.

724
01:19:55,056 --> 01:19:56,683
We'll meet again.

725
01:20:27,722 --> 01:20:30,782
'l, princess Yashodhara..'

726
01:20:32,727 --> 01:20:35,890
'ln the presence of my mother,
all the Gods, and..'

727
01:20:36,965 --> 01:20:44,531
'..my ancestors of the Mihir clan,
accept the post of crown princess.'

728
01:20:48,677 --> 01:20:53,614
'l promise, in my line of duty..'

729
01:20:53,882 --> 01:20:55,611
'..I'll never stagger

730
01:20:56,017 --> 01:21:03,287
'And I'll perform my royal duties
with utmost honesty.'

731
01:21:26,248 --> 01:21:29,513
'l pledge that my subjects
and their happiness..

732
01:21:30,285 --> 01:21:35,780
..will be my first priority.'

733
01:21:36,157 --> 01:21:41,720
'l pledge, today onwards
the friends of Madhavgarh..

734
01:21:41,930 --> 01:21:42,191
..will be my friends too.'

735
01:21:42,898 --> 01:21:44,695
'And the enemies of Madhavgarh..

736
01:21:48,637 --> 01:21:50,002
..will be my enemy.'

737
01:21:52,173 --> 01:21:55,199
Crown princess Yashodhara.
- Glory to her.

738
01:21:55,610 --> 01:21:58,306
Crown princess Yashodhara.
- Glory to her.

739
01:21:58,713 --> 01:22:01,079
Crown princess Yashodhara.
- Glory to her.

740
01:22:01,283 --> 01:22:04,582
Crown princess Yashodhara.
- Glory to her.

741
01:22:37,719 --> 01:22:39,016
The prince..

742
01:22:45,927 --> 01:22:50,830
The way you supported me in front of
Britain's queen after the prince's demise..

743
01:22:50,999 --> 01:22:52,796
You fulfilled your duty by saving..

744
01:22:53,034 --> 01:22:56,765
..the 700-year-old
Mihir clan from extinction.

745
01:22:59,774 --> 01:23:01,139
I'm proud of you.

746
01:23:03,878 --> 01:23:09,441
But some of our guest kings and
political agent Steve have a question.

747
01:23:14,122 --> 01:23:22,222
The pledge that you've taken
to annihilate the enemies..

748
01:23:32,140 --> 01:23:35,132
..how will you fulfill it? Whereas..

749
01:23:36,711 --> 01:23:38,679
I've decided to arrange for your
Swayamvar to answer these questions.

750
01:23:43,051 --> 01:23:46,953
And the first offerings in your marriage
will be made with Veer's blood.

751
01:24:01,002 --> 01:24:05,268
Veer murdered that cripple's sons.

752
01:24:09,944 --> 01:24:11,206
What are you going to do?

753
01:24:11,746 --> 01:24:14,271
Don't tell father anything else.
Otherwise, he'll behead you.

754
01:24:22,357 --> 01:24:23,722
Father.

755
01:24:37,839 --> 01:24:38,931
Imported.

756
01:24:41,209 --> 01:24:43,404
Didn't you get me
any foreign women?

757
01:24:44,846 --> 01:24:46,677
Father.
- Yes.

758
01:24:47,715 --> 01:24:51,446
Love, Father. Love.
- What?

759
01:24:56,591 --> 01:24:59,651
Just like you love your wife.
- Yes.

760
01:24:59,861 --> 01:25:03,888
Similarly, your Veer has
fallen in love with someone.

761
01:25:08,470 --> 01:25:10,700
Can you say that in sobriety?

762
01:25:11,606 --> 01:25:13,471
I can show you.

763
01:25:19,147 --> 01:25:20,614
Did you hear that?

764
01:25:21,116 --> 01:25:23,676
My son is in love.

765
01:25:27,155 --> 01:25:29,885
My Veer is in love.

766
01:25:32,594 --> 01:25:35,995
Mangla, you're safe now.

767
01:25:36,164 --> 01:25:40,760
You're safe now, Mangla.

768
01:25:42,237 --> 01:25:43,670
What's wrong with you?

769
01:25:45,707 --> 01:25:47,937
Father.
- Yes.

770
01:25:54,916 --> 01:25:56,474
Won't you ask her name?

771
01:25:56,684 --> 01:26:00,518
Is it necessary?
- Yes, Father, it is.

772
01:26:00,722 --> 01:26:02,019
Say it.

773
01:26:02,290 --> 01:26:05,885
Dhara.
- Dhara.

774
01:26:06,094 --> 01:26:10,929
Yashodhara.
- Oh, Yashodhara.

775
01:26:11,132 --> 01:26:17,037
Princess.

776
01:26:18,940 --> 01:26:21,135
Madhavgarh's.

777
01:26:56,110 --> 01:26:57,873
What a son!

778
01:26:59,214 --> 01:27:00,841
What a father!

779
01:27:01,049 --> 01:27:02,141
Hey, Mangla.

780
01:27:02,750 --> 01:27:03,682
Hey, Mangla.

781
01:27:03,885 --> 01:27:05,716
Come here. Come here.

782
01:27:06,721 --> 01:27:08,712
She was my enemy's
daughter as well.

783
01:27:09,157 --> 01:27:12,490
Her father didn't agree,
so, I abducted her.

784
01:27:18,766 --> 01:27:21,234
We've received
chief Hyder Ali's message.

785
01:27:22,303 --> 01:27:25,670
All the arrangements will be done
by the next full moon.

786
01:27:27,508 --> 01:27:32,741
More than 15,000 Pindaris
will set out for Madhavgarh.

787
01:27:35,183 --> 01:27:39,847
On that day,
Prithvi will do two things.

788
01:27:40,855 --> 01:27:48,227
First, he'll behead all the British along with
the king and conquer Madhavgarh.

789
01:27:48,730 --> 01:27:54,566
And, second, he'll bring
daughter-in-law home.

790
01:28:01,643 --> 01:28:04,874
Father, when you set
out to get mother..

791
01:28:05,280 --> 01:28:07,976
..did you take your army along?
- No.

792
01:28:08,683 --> 01:28:10,275
Then how could you even think..

793
01:28:11,019 --> 01:28:12,884
..that your Veer will take
an army along?

794
01:28:16,224 --> 01:28:17,213
Now, answer that.

795
01:28:19,594 --> 01:28:21,027
Then give him the bracelets.

796
01:28:24,432 --> 01:28:46,846
EROS

797
01:28:47,822 --> 01:28:53,727
"Every time I look into
your eyes, I see my paradise."

798
01:28:53,928 --> 01:28:59,230
"The stars are shining bright up in
the sky, painting words of desire."

799
01:28:59,434 --> 01:29:02,403
"Oh, charming eyes."

800
01:29:02,770 --> 01:29:11,803
"I've heard that your eyes
cast a beautiful spell."

801
01:29:12,113 --> 01:29:18,074
"And those spells
show beautiful dreams."

802
01:29:18,286 --> 01:29:24,486
"Why don't you visit
my dreams as well."

803
01:29:24,826 --> 01:29:31,789
"Come down on earth,
and come see me."

804
01:29:37,238 --> 01:29:40,036
"Come, and see me."

805
01:29:40,241 --> 01:29:43,301
"Come see me beyond the
restrictions of time."

806
01:29:43,511 --> 01:29:46,503
"Beyond the restrictions of time."

807
01:29:46,914 --> 01:29:50,281
"Come, and see me."

808
01:29:50,518 --> 01:29:54,784
"Try to understand what
my eyes try to convey."

809
01:30:02,797 --> 01:30:05,459
"Oh, charming eyes."

810
01:30:05,967 --> 01:30:08,936
"Cast your spell.."

811
01:30:09,137 --> 01:30:11,571
"Oh, charming eyes."

812
01:30:12,206 --> 01:30:15,073
"Cast your spell.."

813
01:30:18,246 --> 01:30:20,237
I don't understand this at all.

814
01:30:20,448 --> 01:30:22,575
What is this madness?
It's a strange hobby.

815
01:30:23,017 --> 01:30:26,953
She has come so far.
All the way from Madhavgarh..

816
01:30:27,155 --> 01:30:28,383
..to Ranthambore to
take photos of animals.

817
01:30:28,823 --> 01:30:32,088
I think the daughter of Madhavgarh's
political agent has lost her mind.

818
01:30:32,293 --> 01:30:34,853
Madhavgarh's political agent's daughter?

819
01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:42,831
Ms. Anjala.
- No, Angela.

820
01:30:43,037 --> 01:30:45,232
Good name.
- Thank you.

821
01:30:45,606 --> 01:30:47,904
Good.
- Thank you.

822
01:30:48,609 --> 01:30:50,702
But this jungle is no good.

823
01:30:50,912 --> 01:30:52,777
No birds, no deer.

824
01:30:54,582 --> 01:30:55,105
There.

825
01:30:58,753 --> 01:31:00,084
Sorry.
- There.

826
01:31:01,689 --> 01:31:03,156
Tiger. Do something.

827
01:31:03,357 --> 01:31:05,723
Madam, we can't do anything.

828
01:31:05,927 --> 01:31:08,862
Now, the tiger will do
whatever needs to be done.

829
01:31:09,764 --> 01:31:11,755
Run. Run, madam.

830
01:31:12,166 --> 01:31:13,724
Someone help.

831
01:31:15,169 --> 01:31:16,659
Help, somebody.

832
01:31:16,871 --> 01:31:18,634
Help.

833
01:31:30,785 --> 01:31:36,451
Leave me. Leave me, Veer.
Do you want to kill me?

834
01:31:39,827 --> 01:31:41,886
I got trapped in my own ploy.

835
01:31:44,432 --> 01:31:45,592
The work is already done.

836
01:31:46,701 --> 01:31:49,966
This is the north-West border of our
princely state of Madhavgarh.

837
01:31:50,505 --> 01:31:52,473
I'm deeply honoured that you've
accepted our invitation..

838
01:31:52,673 --> 01:31:53,731
..to be our guest
for a couple of days.

839
01:31:53,975 --> 01:31:56,102
So, we can pay back for
all you've done for us.

840
01:31:56,477 --> 01:31:57,705
I'm very grateful.

841
01:31:57,912 --> 01:32:00,403
With Lord Rama's grace,
everything goes right.

842
01:32:00,615 --> 01:32:04,676
And anyway, anyone else
would've done the same thing.

843
01:32:04,886 --> 01:32:05,818
You're too modest.

844
01:32:06,020 --> 01:32:08,079
No one risks his
life for a stranger.

845
01:32:08,489 --> 01:32:10,389
Strangers? We're no strangers.

846
01:32:10,558 --> 01:32:12,116
What do you say, Ms. Angela?
- Oh, yes.

847
01:32:12,493 --> 01:32:14,654
I owe my life to the prince.

848
01:32:17,098 --> 01:32:18,065
Punya.

849
01:32:18,633 --> 01:32:20,999
Angela. Angela.

850
01:32:25,573 --> 01:32:28,440
Thank God, you're fine.
- Don't worry, I'm okay.

851
01:32:28,609 --> 01:32:29,940
Thank you.

852
01:32:30,578 --> 01:32:32,739
Poonam.

853
01:32:32,947 --> 01:32:35,074
No, Poonam Singh.

854
01:32:35,716 --> 01:32:38,651
This is my cousin. William.
- William.

855
01:32:38,986 --> 01:32:40,146
Hillary William.

856
01:32:40,688 --> 01:32:41,746
Pleasure meeting you.

857
01:32:41,956 --> 01:32:45,050
So, what time?
- Wrong time.

858
01:32:47,995 --> 01:32:49,963
I've recently been appointed
as the political agent..

859
01:32:50,164 --> 01:32:51,756
..of the kingdom of Madhavgarh.

860
01:32:52,700 --> 01:32:54,463
Is Madhavgarh expecting a war?

861
01:32:54,769 --> 01:32:58,728
No. Preparing for a hunt.
- Hunt?

862
01:32:59,640 --> 01:33:02,006
Yes, we've decided to root out
these barbaric Pindaris..

863
01:33:02,209 --> 01:33:03,437
..once and for all.

864
01:33:05,146 --> 01:33:06,909
Barbaric Pindaris.
- Yes.

865
01:33:13,921 --> 01:33:16,321
We've combed through the
entire jungle, Your Highness.

866
01:33:16,524 --> 01:33:18,992
All our commanders
from the ally kingdoms..

867
01:33:19,226 --> 01:33:21,194
..have decided to set up
camp near the river.

868
01:33:21,429 --> 01:33:27,493
Narsingh, we should use
the camps as quagmires.

869
01:33:28,502 --> 01:33:33,940
It should pose as a shield for us,
and a death-trap for them.

870
01:33:54,528 --> 01:33:56,496
Angela, what a brave girl!

871
01:33:57,965 --> 01:33:58,954
How are you feeling now, my love?

872
01:33:59,166 --> 01:34:00,895
Thank you, sir. I'm fine.

873
01:34:01,102 --> 01:34:04,663
I'm so lucky, Prince.

874
01:34:07,475 --> 01:34:09,409
You've done a brave deed.

875
01:34:09,910 --> 01:34:14,006
Doing such brave deeds is
a common thing for me.

876
01:34:17,485 --> 01:34:20,010
Where do you hail from,
Prince Mahendra Pratap Singh?

877
01:34:20,421 --> 01:34:21,683
Rusai Valley.

878
01:34:22,089 --> 01:34:23,454
Rusai Valley?

879
01:34:24,158 --> 01:34:28,117
It's a 14 day journey towards
the Kailash confluence.

880
01:34:28,663 --> 01:34:31,791
The mountain dacoits
have terrorised our valley.

881
01:34:32,600 --> 01:34:35,398
They steal our ready crops,
and flee into the snow regions.

882
01:34:35,569 --> 01:34:40,563
Just like the Pindaris kill your people
and flee into the desert.

883
01:34:41,008 --> 01:34:47,140
And to kill them, we need light-Weighted
and long-distance cannons.

884
01:34:48,182 --> 01:34:51,049
We were going to Vijay
regarding that matter.

885
01:34:52,820 --> 01:34:55,186
This time, we've thought that..

886
01:34:56,857 --> 01:34:59,052
..we'll enter their snowy region
and turn it into their grave.

887
01:34:59,727 --> 01:35:01,558
Pleased to meet you.

888
01:35:02,496 --> 01:35:04,691
I'm equally happy to meet you.

889
01:35:11,172 --> 01:35:16,166
Me too.
- I apologise, Your Highness.

890
01:35:18,145 --> 01:35:19,442
That's okay.

891
01:35:20,448 --> 01:35:24,145
Whenever someone extends his hand
it reminds me of the moment..

892
01:35:25,119 --> 01:35:26,814
..when he deceitfully
severed my hand.

893
01:35:27,755 --> 01:35:30,918
And then I think about
the moment..

894
01:35:32,093 --> 01:35:37,827
..when I'll behead him,
and it makes me happy.

895
01:35:46,006 --> 01:35:48,065
I never forget my enemies.

896
01:35:49,110 --> 01:35:51,010
I too never forget my enemies.

897
01:35:54,548 --> 01:35:57,073
Whichever part I get hold of
I rip off five kilos of flesh.

898
01:35:58,819 --> 01:36:00,912
I don't even leave that much.

899
01:36:02,022 --> 01:36:05,082
Wow. I've learnt
a new thing today.

900
01:36:06,594 --> 01:36:11,497
I promise, I won't leave a
strand of hair of my enemy's body.

901
01:36:16,937 --> 01:36:20,896
Oh, Princess,
I was so scared..

902
01:36:21,108 --> 01:36:23,736
Accidentally, your father's
hand came off.

903
01:36:23,944 --> 01:36:26,970
But you know,
the king is such a sport..

904
01:36:27,181 --> 01:36:31,515
He handled the situation so well
that everyone was relaxed.

905
01:36:31,752 --> 01:36:36,519
Not only that, he declared the
saviour of Angela his state guest.

906
01:36:36,891 --> 01:36:39,086
Such a brave person he is.

907
01:36:39,794 --> 01:36:41,694
What is it called in Hindi?

908
01:36:42,863 --> 01:36:43,761
Veer (Brave).

909
01:36:45,199 --> 01:36:50,831
A real Veer. Kind and cultured.
But fearless.

910
01:36:54,141 --> 01:36:55,972
I love this music.

911
01:36:56,243 --> 01:36:58,108
The rehearsal has
begun for the song.

912
01:36:58,312 --> 01:36:59,711
Come. Come, Princess.

913
01:36:59,880 --> 01:37:01,541
You must perform too.

914
01:37:01,816 --> 01:37:02,748

01:37:41,755 --> 01:37:42,983

Wow.

971
01:44:01,235 --> 01:44:05,433
Hillary, did you
learn all this for me?

972
01:44:10,143 --> 01:44:12,771
So, what time?
- After marriage.

973
01:44:23,857 --> 01:44:26,325
Two days ago, I sent a
message to the prince.

974
01:44:26,493 --> 01:44:27,858
He didn't come see me.

975
01:44:28,061 --> 01:44:30,291
He was out with Angela on that day.

976
01:44:31,064 --> 01:44:31,928
Oh.

977
01:44:33,233 --> 01:44:34,097
Where is he right now?

978
01:44:34,301 --> 01:44:35,461
Good.

979
01:44:37,838 --> 01:44:38,896
Nice.

980
01:44:39,273 --> 01:44:42,071
You are learning it soon
and playing it in tune.

981
01:44:42,276 --> 01:44:45,404
That means you are learning quickly,
and learning the tune.

982
01:44:48,482 --> 01:44:49,312
Hello.

983
01:44:51,985 --> 01:44:53,179
Hello, Princess.

984
01:44:53,453 --> 01:44:56,115
Can I steal the prince
from you for a moment, Angela?

985
01:44:58,825 --> 01:45:01,293
Okay.
- But ma'am..

986
01:45:03,397 --> 01:45:08,027
What do you think? I'm seeing
whatever you're showing me?

987
01:45:09,102 --> 01:45:10,194
Stop it, Veer.

988
01:45:10,904 --> 01:45:13,031
When Angela finds out the truth..

989
01:45:14,574 --> 01:45:15,836
What is the truth?

990
01:45:19,279 --> 01:45:21,509
Why don't you understand
my helplessness?

991
01:45:22,983 --> 01:45:24,245
You've fulfilled your promise,

992
01:45:24,651 --> 01:45:25,982
Please leave now.

993
01:45:28,955 --> 01:45:32,391
Princess, how can I leave?

994
01:45:33,126 --> 01:45:35,185
Your father has invited me.

995
01:45:36,596 --> 01:45:38,154
For your Swayamvar.

996
01:45:43,170 --> 01:45:48,506
If you don't leave Madhavgarh
by sunset tomorrow..

997
01:45:49,042 --> 01:45:53,035
..I'll do exactly
what a princess should've done.

01:46:45,732 --> 01:46:49,065
"The wind carries the messages."

999
01:46:49,269 --> 01:46:52,432
"The wind carries the messages."

1000
01:46:52,706 --> 01:46:55,732
"Don't write your
messages on the leaves."

1001
01:46:56,143 --> 01:46:59,135
"Don't write your
messages on the leaves."

1002
01:47:04,785 --> 01:47:06,377
So, Veer hasn't left.

1003
01:47:11,525 --> 01:47:14,653
'Dear Father,
I've committed a crime.'

1004
01:47:15,061 --> 01:47:17,120
'ln the flow of my emotions..'

1005
01:47:17,330 --> 01:47:19,560
'..I staggered in
fulfilling my duty.'

1006
01:47:19,733 --> 01:47:22,964
'Prince Mahendra
Pratap Singh is Veer.'

1007
01:47:23,203 --> 01:47:25,228
'Yours Yashodhara.'

1008
01:47:25,439 --> 01:47:28,567
"The wind carries the messages."

1009
01:47:28,742 --> 01:47:31,734
"The wind carries the messages."
- Give it to the king.

1010
01:47:32,312 --> 01:47:35,509
"Don't write your
messages on the leaves."

1011
01:47:35,715 --> 01:47:38,741
"Don't write your
messages on the leaves."

1012
01:47:39,319 --> 01:47:42,413
"When these messages
reach foreign land.."

1013
01:47:42,622 --> 01:47:45,716
"..they'll cause only grief."

1014
01:47:46,092 --> 01:47:47,184
"Someone stop it."

1015
01:47:47,394 --> 01:47:49,521
"Someone stop the sun from setting."

1016
01:47:49,729 --> 01:47:52,664
"Somebody save us."

1017
01:47:52,799 --> 01:47:54,061
"My life is full of darkness."

1018
01:47:54,267 --> 01:47:56,201
"Somebody please diminish it."

1019
01:47:56,403 --> 01:47:59,133
"All the doors are closed."

1020
01:47:59,339 --> 01:48:00,738
"No one gives me any solution."

1021
01:48:01,107 --> 01:48:06,739
"My legs have been chained."

1022
01:48:37,310 --> 01:48:38,607
The letter..

1023
01:48:39,412 --> 01:48:43,439
This isn't a letter,
it's the army details.

1024
01:48:44,551 --> 01:48:45,677
Thank God.

1025
01:48:46,086 --> 01:48:49,055
We've worked out a new war
strategy to annihilate the Pindaris.

1026
01:48:49,256 --> 01:48:54,125
And we're most grateful for
the Prince's valuable suggestion.

1027
01:48:54,361 --> 01:48:56,727
Prince?
- Yes.

1028
01:48:57,531 --> 01:49:02,559
Yes. When he can to go after
the dacoits in winter..

1029
01:49:02,769 --> 01:49:04,760
..then why can't we go into the desert
after the Pindaris in summer?

1030
01:49:06,473 --> 01:49:09,408
That's the reason
I've combined my army..

1031
01:49:09,609 --> 01:49:13,443
..With the armies of my ally, and
directed them towards the desert.

1032
01:49:13,647 --> 01:49:16,707
You know, in the summer you can't see
anything in the desert beyond 10-12 feet.

1033
01:49:16,917 --> 01:49:20,216
The desert storm can
diminish our army.

1034
01:49:20,420 --> 01:49:22,411
The same goes for the
Pindaris as well.

1035
01:49:29,563 --> 01:49:32,532
They can't avert the
desert storm as well.

1036
01:49:32,832 --> 01:49:34,322
This is the right time.

1037
01:49:34,834 --> 01:49:36,301
To find their whereabouts..

1038
01:49:37,771 --> 01:49:41,172
..and annihilate the armed
and unarmed Pindaris.

1039
01:50:13,340 --> 01:50:15,103
You didn't give the letter, did you?

1040
01:50:18,411 --> 01:50:20,811
Why do you understand my heart so well?

1041
01:50:21,014 --> 01:50:21,571
Why?

1042
01:50:23,550 --> 01:50:25,177
The one who should, he..

1043
01:50:28,555 --> 01:50:30,352
It'll cause a great catastrophe.

1044
01:50:32,459 --> 01:50:34,324
Give the letter to the king.

1045
01:50:34,527 --> 01:50:36,620
But Veer took that letter..

1046
01:50:37,464 --> 01:50:38,260
What?

1047
01:50:38,465 --> 01:50:44,267
"Respected, Father.
I've committed a crime."

1048
01:50:46,139 --> 01:50:48,266
"Prince Mahendra
Pratap Singh is Veer."

1049
01:50:50,577 --> 01:50:56,345
"l didn't tell you the truth
because my feelings for him.."

1050
01:51:07,327 --> 01:51:09,295
Should I say it in front
of everyone?

1051
01:51:18,638 --> 01:51:26,010
A Pindari's hand is made of steel.
You'll grow tired, Princess.

1052
01:51:39,125 --> 01:51:44,358
You formed a watch on my hand.
Good times are about to begin for me.

1053
01:51:57,577 --> 01:51:59,909
What's the truth, and what's not?

1054
01:52:00,080 --> 01:52:01,547
What should I understand?
What should I do?

1055
01:52:01,948 --> 01:52:04,246
Father has sent bracelets
for his daughter-in-law.

1056
01:52:14,360 --> 01:52:15,588
Tell me something, Veer.

1057
01:52:16,730 --> 01:52:22,259
If you've to choose between your father
and me then who will you choose?

1058
01:52:24,738 --> 01:52:25,966
The truth.

1059
01:52:26,372 --> 01:52:31,605
If father is right,
then every son follows him.

1060
01:52:32,645 --> 01:52:38,106
But what if the father is wrong?
Should the child leave him then?

1061
01:52:38,485 --> 01:52:41,181
He shouldn't leave,
nor support him.

1062
01:52:42,021 --> 01:52:43,181
Instead, bring him on
the right track.

1063
01:52:43,556 --> 01:52:44,716
Which path is right?

1064
01:52:45,325 --> 01:52:47,122
They shouldn't carry out
their royal duties.

1065
01:52:47,761 --> 01:52:49,285
Or let the lineage passed
down on them..

1066
01:52:49,496 --> 01:52:50,554
..through our ancestors be extinct?

1067
01:52:53,600 --> 01:52:57,366
Deceitfully killing 4500 Pindaris.

1068
01:52:57,570 --> 01:52:59,037
Is that called doing your duty?

1069
01:53:01,541 --> 01:53:04,635
Enslaving Madhavgarh to the British.

1070
01:53:05,044 --> 01:53:06,341
Is that called carrying
forward the lineage?

1071
01:53:08,314 --> 01:53:14,184
Princess. Your kingdom isn't in
danger from the Pindaris..

1072
01:53:14,387 --> 01:53:16,218
..but from your own father.

1073
01:53:20,026 --> 01:53:22,494
If your father had kept
his promise..

1074
01:53:23,563 --> 01:53:25,360
..this would've never happened.

1075
01:53:27,634 --> 01:53:28,362
The pledge that you've taken..

1076
01:53:28,568 --> 01:53:30,195
..for the welfare of your kingdom..

1077
01:53:34,073 --> 01:53:35,734
I'll support you in that.

1078
01:53:38,077 --> 01:53:41,740
I promise, your army
will not be harmed.

1079
01:53:43,817 --> 01:53:50,381
The Pindaris won't attack,
as long as you don't attack them.

1080
01:53:53,526 --> 01:53:57,929
Now, I'll adorn you
with these bracelets..

1081
01:54:00,533 --> 01:54:03,263
..When you muster the
courage to speak the truth.

1082
01:54:05,972 --> 01:54:11,103
You'll address me Veer in
front of the entire world.

1083
01:54:15,381 --> 01:54:16,507
We'll meet again.

1084
01:54:16,916 --> 01:54:31,388
"lt has left the sky."

1085
01:54:31,598 --> 01:54:33,896
'How can I call you Veer?'

1086
01:54:34,100 --> 01:54:36,068
'The king is after your..'

1087
01:54:36,502 --> 01:54:38,129
'The first ritual in your marriage..'

1088
01:54:38,338 --> 01:54:40,363
'..Will be carried out
with Veer's blood.'

1089
01:54:46,112 --> 01:54:49,206
"Krishna.."

1090
01:54:49,415 --> 01:54:54,409
"Krishna. Krishna.."

1091
01:54:54,621 --> 01:54:57,419
"Krishna.."

1092
01:55:45,638 --> 01:55:48,129
Veer.

1093
01:55:53,579 --> 01:55:56,412
We had decided to meet in winter.

1094
01:55:56,849 --> 01:55:58,874
Why did you call us in
this blazing summer?

1095
01:55:59,285 --> 01:56:01,913
We hadn't finished preparing yet.

1096
01:56:02,322 --> 01:56:07,487
Father, those British
had united eight kings.

1097
01:56:07,694 --> 01:56:12,654
But we diverted their
armies towards the jungle.

1098
01:56:13,866 --> 01:56:18,826
What a son I have!
- Stop, Veer!

1099
01:56:19,872 --> 01:56:23,774
Veer!
- Father! Veer, careful!

1100
01:56:27,413 --> 01:56:27,845
Come on!

1101
01:56:28,247 --> 01:56:31,375
Father!
- My son!

1102
01:56:37,457 --> 01:56:40,722
Come on.
- Father.

1103
01:56:40,927 --> 01:56:44,522
Today, if I catch you,
I'll not spare you!

1104
01:56:44,764 --> 01:56:46,561
Come on.

1105
01:56:46,933 --> 01:56:57,434
Father! Veer!
- You!

1106
01:57:04,317 --> 01:57:05,284
Prithvi.

1107
01:57:07,487 --> 01:57:08,749
You're so fortunate.

1108
01:57:10,256 --> 01:57:10,847
Chief.

1109
01:57:11,257 --> 01:57:11,689
Bravo.

1110
01:57:11,891 --> 01:57:13,984
When these two are by my side..

1111
01:57:14,727 --> 01:57:18,219
..I can win the entire world,
and not just Madhavgarh.

1112
01:57:18,431 --> 01:57:20,365
Forget that, Prithvi.

1113
01:57:20,566 --> 01:57:24,502
Ask Veer, did he win
over the princess or not?

1114
01:57:25,004 --> 01:57:27,632
Naunihal, why do you ask him?

1115
01:57:28,007 --> 01:57:29,338
Ask me.

1116
01:57:29,542 --> 01:57:32,033
All you need is
strength in your arms.

1117
01:57:32,612 --> 01:57:35,979
Women and horses
are one and the same.

1118
01:57:36,382 --> 01:57:37,349
Look here.

1119
01:57:42,321 --> 01:57:44,346
Pick her up like this.

1120
01:57:45,958 --> 01:57:49,485
The first drink is in the
name of those Pindaris..

1121
01:57:49,695 --> 01:57:52,027
..Who aren't amongst us anymore.

1122
01:57:54,400 --> 01:57:59,428
Veer. You mean to say,
we don't have to fight the battle.

1123
01:57:59,639 --> 01:58:01,732
Keep our swords inside
the scabbard.

1124
01:58:01,941 --> 01:58:04,375
Wait in this summer.

1125
01:58:04,577 --> 01:58:08,411
Naunihal, let's see
what Veer has to say.

1126
01:58:08,681 --> 01:58:13,948
Chief, have we lost our minds..

1127
01:58:14,353 --> 01:58:15,718
..to listen to this young boy?

1128
01:58:15,922 --> 01:58:18,789
Gajdhar, if we had to decide
with our swords..

1129
01:58:18,991 --> 01:58:21,425
..then we wouldn't have lost
our brothers 25 years ago.

1130
01:58:23,930 --> 01:58:26,023
Veer has returned from England..

1131
01:58:26,432 --> 01:58:27,831
..With a new sight and vision.

1132
01:58:32,105 --> 01:58:34,437
Your son Veer will be
the chief in this battle.

1133
01:58:41,681 --> 01:58:44,013
What prejudice!

1134
01:58:45,118 --> 01:58:48,212
25 years ago,
you trusted Prithvi..

1135
01:58:48,421 --> 01:58:50,252
..and sent him to see the king.

1136
01:58:50,756 --> 01:58:54,283
And 4500 Pindaris
were killed deceitfully.

1137
01:58:54,460 --> 01:58:56,428
And today, you're going to
make another mistake..

1138
01:58:56,629 --> 01:58:58,563
..by trusting his son.

1139
01:58:59,165 --> 01:59:01,759
Naunihal.
Just because this boy..

1140
01:59:02,735 --> 01:59:05,067
..received education
in a foreign country..

1141
01:59:05,271 --> 01:59:07,569
He'll order us around.

1142
01:59:15,014 --> 01:59:17,141
He has only received
education in England.

1143
01:59:18,417 --> 01:59:20,044
But he isn't a foreigner's son.

1144
01:59:20,653 --> 01:59:25,147
He is not a British man's son,
but yours.

1145
01:59:25,358 --> 01:59:27,519
But your son has learnt to
flee like them cowardly.

1146
01:59:27,727 --> 01:59:29,194
Uncle.

1147
01:59:38,538 --> 01:59:43,498
Let me know what's been going on
in your mind for so many years.

1148
01:59:43,709 --> 01:59:45,506
What do you mean by
what I am thinking?

1149
01:59:45,711 --> 01:59:47,406
We would've been betrayed..

1150
01:59:47,613 --> 01:59:50,207
..if I had gone to take
our lands back.

1151
01:59:50,416 --> 01:59:51,815
I would've strangled the
king right there.

1152
01:59:52,218 --> 01:59:55,210
And you fled from there, coward.

1153
01:59:56,822 --> 01:59:59,052
You dare abuse my father.
- I will kill you.

1154
01:59:59,258 --> 02:00:02,318
Wherever I'll get a hold,
I rip off five kilos of flesh.

1155
02:00:06,199 --> 02:00:07,359
You dare challenge me.

1156
02:00:07,567 --> 02:00:09,535
You dare challenge Gajdhar.

1157
02:00:09,735 --> 02:00:12,704
I'll bury you right here.

1158
02:00:13,105 --> 02:00:16,074
Start digging, we'll see
who buries alive who.

1159
02:00:16,275 --> 02:00:21,076
Don't go back on your words
if you're Prithvi Singh's son.

1160
02:00:21,280 --> 02:00:25,444
Now, we'll decide with
life and death.

1161
02:00:25,618 --> 02:00:27,108
So be it.

1162
02:00:31,424 --> 02:00:32,516
Shut up, Gajdhar.

1163
02:00:32,825 --> 02:00:34,554
He's a fool.

1164
02:00:34,727 --> 02:00:36,820
Why are we Pindaris
fighting amongst ourselves?

1165
02:00:37,230 --> 02:00:37,821
Prithvi..

1166
02:00:38,231 --> 02:00:39,755
An arrow shot from the bow..

1167
02:00:40,800 --> 02:00:43,860
..and words once spoken,
can never be taken back.

1168
02:00:45,805 --> 02:00:47,329
This battle will be fought.

1169
02:00:47,540 --> 02:00:48,802
And whoever survives..

1170
02:00:49,442 --> 02:00:52,206
..Will be the chief of
15000 Pindaris.

1171
02:02:17,496 --> 02:02:20,158
You cannot die so easily.

1172
02:02:20,366 --> 02:02:22,732
You abused my father.
Get up!

1173
02:02:23,336 --> 02:02:28,899
Get up!

1174
02:02:29,308 --> 02:02:30,468
Get up!

1175
02:03:17,022 --> 02:03:18,853
Get it weighed.

1176
02:03:19,258 --> 02:03:20,725
It will be five kilos.

1177
02:03:22,895 --> 02:03:29,596
Everyone, shift camps behind
the hills of Madhavgarh. - Yes.

1178
02:03:37,309 --> 02:03:42,508
Father, we'll meet next after
I win your daughter-in-law's hand.

1179
02:03:43,416 --> 02:03:45,748
Veer, be victorious.

1180
02:03:45,951 --> 02:03:48,249
Veer, be victorious.

1181
02:03:55,661 --> 02:03:59,461
Its a very special day
for Madhavgarh today.

1182
02:04:00,232 --> 02:04:03,463
By organising the age-old
tradition of Swayamvar..

1183
02:04:03,736 --> 02:04:09,766
..the king has done a
favour on all of Madhavgarh.

1184
02:04:10,176 --> 02:04:16,137
I would like to thank
the kings, the guests

1185
02:04:16,348 --> 02:04:20,341
competing princes and
the residents of Madhavgarh.

1186
02:04:20,553 --> 02:04:23,818
..for their presence,
on behalf of the king.

1187
02:04:24,223 --> 02:04:26,885
He's the pride of the Rajputs.

1188
02:04:27,293 --> 02:04:28,817
The descendant of Mihir clan.

1189
02:04:29,228 --> 02:04:31,822
I'm very sure that Pindari
will surely come here.

1190
02:04:32,231 --> 02:04:34,358
Just give me a sign..

1191
02:04:34,567 --> 02:04:39,698
..and watch how I avenge
the death of your brothers.

1192
02:04:40,673 --> 02:04:43,836
Okay.
- Hail the king of Madhavgarh.

1193
02:04:44,243 --> 02:04:46,734
Hail princess Yashodhara.

1194
02:04:46,946 --> 02:04:49,676
Hail the crown princess.

1195
02:04:49,882 --> 02:04:51,543
Hail the king of Madhavgarh.

1196
02:04:51,750 --> 02:04:54,150
Princess, I'm looking
for the prince as well.

1197
02:04:54,353 --> 02:04:56,548
He still hasn't
arrived from Vijaynagar.

1198
02:04:56,789 --> 02:04:59,417
Hail the king of Madhavgarh.
Hail the crown princess.

1199
02:04:59,625 --> 02:05:03,288
Oh, I forgot.
This is my fiance John. - Hello.

1200
02:05:04,497 --> 02:05:05,395
Hello.

1201
02:05:05,798 --> 02:05:07,595
John also has a
passion for folk music.

1202
02:05:07,800 --> 02:05:09,791
That is why I've been
learning it from the prince.

1203
02:05:09,969 --> 02:05:14,838
And now, it's time to
welcome our chief guest..

1204
02:05:15,007 --> 02:05:21,310
..the great governor general Fraser..

1205
02:05:21,514 --> 02:05:28,511
..Who in the year 1872,
along with king Gyanendra..

1206
02:05:28,854 --> 02:05:32,187
..slew 4500 Pindari revolutionaries.

1207
02:05:32,391 --> 02:05:35,360
Now, we would like to
request Mr. Fraser..

1208
02:05:35,561 --> 02:05:37,256
..to say a few words.

1209
02:05:37,596 --> 02:05:39,621
Hello. Hello.

1210
02:05:39,832 --> 02:05:41,629
Hello, everybody.

1211
02:05:41,834 --> 02:05:44,997
I'm honoured to be present
in this Swayamvar ceremony.

1212
02:05:45,404 --> 02:05:48,862
And for this purpose,
we've got a warrior.

1213
02:05:49,708 --> 02:05:54,338
And that's why, to make
this competition interesting..

1214
02:05:54,547 --> 02:05:56,515
..We've brought a warrior along.

1215
02:05:56,715 --> 02:05:59,479
With the king's permission,
it has been decided..

1216
02:05:59,685 --> 02:06:03,348
..that any prince who
defeats this warrior..

1217
02:06:03,889 --> 02:06:06,756
..Will win the princess's hand
in marriage.

1218
02:06:08,394 --> 02:06:12,524
And here comes the
giant warrior Rhino.

1219
02:06:12,731 --> 02:06:17,395
The great warrior Rhino.

1220
02:06:40,259 --> 02:06:42,523
Who will fight with me?

1221
02:06:43,262 --> 02:06:46,231
Come down, and fight.

1222
02:06:52,705 --> 02:06:55,299
Is there nobody who can
fight with me?

1223
02:06:55,507 --> 02:06:57,668
Are there any real men here?

1224
02:06:59,378 --> 02:07:02,472
I need to see how
hot-blooded the royal blood is.

1225
02:07:03,349 --> 02:07:05,317
How dare he say that?

1226
02:07:07,486 --> 02:07:09,420
Say it, as I said it.

1227
02:07:11,523 --> 02:07:13,388
Is there a man among you?

1228
02:07:14,526 --> 02:07:17,552
I want to see the rage
in a Rajput's blood.

1229
02:07:23,869 --> 02:07:27,361
What happened?
Has your rage died down?

1230
02:07:27,873 --> 02:07:30,899
Is that all the rage
that's in royal blood?

1231
02:08:46,985 --> 02:08:49,249
The royal blood's
filled with so much rage..

1232
02:08:49,555 --> 02:08:52,888
..that a single drop is
enough to burn your fair skin.

1233
02:08:53,325 --> 02:08:56,556
Glory to..
- Prince Mahendra Pratap Singh.

1234
02:08:56,762 --> 02:08:59,663
Glory to..
- Prince Mahendra Pratap Singh.

1235
02:12:29,207 --> 02:12:30,572
Veer!

1236
02:13:05,844 --> 02:13:09,075
Yes, I'm Veer!

1237
02:13:10,849 --> 02:13:12,783
The son of Prithvi Singh!

1238
02:13:13,018 --> 02:13:14,645
A Pindari!

1239
02:13:14,953 --> 02:13:15,977
Veer!

1240
02:13:16,488 --> 02:13:17,546
Veer!

1241
02:13:52,691 --> 02:13:59,597
"Solitude. Solitude."

1242
02:14:33,098 --> 02:14:36,033
I'll cut you into so many pieces, that..

1243
02:14:39,671 --> 02:14:40,501
Yasho.

1244
02:14:42,507 --> 02:14:48,605
Dear, I've cradled you
for hours with this one hand.

1245
02:14:49,815 --> 02:14:53,512
I've tucked you in bed
with this one hand, and..

1246
02:14:53,718 --> 02:14:57,176
That's why I always
followed my father.

1247
02:14:58,657 --> 02:15:00,124
But for a crown princess..

1248
02:15:00,892 --> 02:15:03,019
..Veer's way is the righteous one.

1249
02:15:24,316 --> 02:15:25,977
Yashodhara is Prithvi Singh's
daughter-in-law..

1250
02:15:26,184 --> 02:15:27,708
..and Veer's wife.

1251
02:15:29,254 --> 02:15:31,745
If anyone tries to harm him..

1252
02:15:32,257 --> 02:15:34,316
..then Veer will wreak havoc..

1253
02:15:35,193 --> 02:15:37,627
..that'll be worse than
earthquakes and storms.

1254
02:15:40,799 --> 02:15:42,266
Calm down, King.

1255
02:15:43,368 --> 02:15:46,235
The Pindaris have
taken over Madhavgarh.

1256
02:15:48,240 --> 02:15:51,334
And we've learnt treachery
from you.

1257
02:15:52,844 --> 02:15:54,243
We came to Madhavgarh
for making the preparations.

1258
02:15:54,646 --> 02:15:56,136
Half of your army has
advanced towards the jungle.

1259
02:15:56,348 --> 02:15:58,282
We've sabotaged almost
all of your canons.

1260
02:15:58,750 --> 02:16:02,345
And look, we've closed all the
secret passages for your escape.

1261
02:16:05,357 --> 02:16:06,847
Are you listening to this sound?

1262
02:16:07,592 --> 02:16:09,617
Listen closely, King.

1263
02:16:15,867 --> 02:16:18,335
The Pindaris have surrounded
the fort from all sides.

1264
02:16:18,970 --> 02:16:23,805
Now, you won't be safe
behind these walls for long.

1265
02:16:24,009 --> 02:16:26,807
Sooner or later, you'll
have to open your doors..

1266
02:16:27,245 --> 02:16:29,008
..for water and supplies.

1267
02:16:29,281 --> 02:16:31,715
If you don't do that,
the hungry and thirsty people..

1268
02:16:31,917 --> 02:16:33,976
..Will slay you along
with the British.

1269
02:16:36,054 --> 02:16:38,887
We'll see who beheads whom?
- Your Highness.

1270
02:16:46,031 --> 02:16:48,693
Mr. Veer, you must know..

1271
02:16:48,967 --> 02:16:51,993
..that we British are
not afraid of massacre.

1272
02:16:54,072 --> 02:16:56,131
In your holy book,
the Bhagwat Gita..

1273
02:16:56,708 --> 02:16:59,643
..your Lord Krishna has said,
"War should be the final option."

1274
02:17:00,478 --> 02:17:03,140
So, Mr. Veer, you can
take Madhavgarh..

1275
02:17:03,548 --> 02:17:05,072
..and give us a safe passage.

1276
02:17:17,195 --> 02:17:18,992
I didn't appoint you the
chief for this battle..

1277
02:17:19,197 --> 02:17:20,858
..so that you can think in
the favour of those British.

1278
02:17:20,999 --> 02:17:22,933
I'm not thinking in the
favour of the British.

1279
02:17:23,902 --> 02:17:26,097
I'm thinking about the
entire country, Uncle.

1280
02:17:28,773 --> 02:17:32,004
Veer. Why are you suddenly
concerned about the country?

1281
02:17:32,978 --> 02:17:34,639
This is our battle.

1282
02:17:34,946 --> 02:17:36,538
This is our country as well.

1283
02:17:39,618 --> 02:17:41,916
After going to England,
I've understood one thing.

1284
02:17:42,220 --> 02:17:44,814
There's no point in
massacring a few British.

1285
02:17:45,223 --> 02:17:47,191
We'll have to drive them
out of the entire country.

1286
02:17:47,592 --> 02:17:48,957
Let's drive them out then.

1287
02:17:49,294 --> 02:17:50,989
Let's drive them out
of the entire country.

1288
02:17:51,730 --> 02:17:52,958
Once we kill a few thousands..

1289
02:17:53,164 --> 02:17:54,927
..the rest will flee on their own.

1290
02:17:55,033 --> 02:17:57,058
Not just the British.

1291
02:17:57,269 --> 02:17:58,634
The kings that attended the Swayamvar..

1292
02:17:58,837 --> 02:18:00,168
..the soldiers of Madhavgarh,
and a few hundred Pindaris..

1293
02:18:00,572 --> 02:18:02,870
..aren't the only one's
who'll lose their lives.

1294
02:18:03,041 --> 02:18:05,271
But the innocent
and helpless..

1295
02:18:05,977 --> 02:18:07,308
..residents who live in
the palace will die too.

1296
02:18:07,712 --> 02:18:09,907
And if we can attain
Madhavgarh without battle..

1297
02:18:10,115 --> 02:18:11,013
..then why shed blood?

1298
02:18:11,216 --> 02:18:13,013
What should we do?

1299
02:18:13,218 --> 02:18:17,882
Like you say, should we lead
that king, that officer Frazer..

1300
02:18:18,056 --> 02:18:22,550
..and the British soldiers
to the border?

1301
02:18:22,761 --> 02:18:25,992
Those British have thought
of a wonderful plan to escape.

1302
02:18:26,898 --> 02:18:28,832
We want blood,
and not Madhavgarh.

1303
02:18:29,034 --> 02:18:34,836
They blew up our comrades,
have you forgotten that?

1304
02:18:38,743 --> 02:18:39,937
'Fire.'

1305
02:18:45,050 --> 02:18:46,483
What do you feel?

1306
02:18:47,452 --> 02:18:49,386
Even if we let them go..

1307
02:18:50,188 --> 02:18:55,490
..they won't come back again?
They won't attack us again?

1308
02:18:56,795 --> 02:18:58,626
And won't people die then?

1309
02:18:59,631 --> 02:19:02,361
They'll deceive us,
and attack us as well.

1310
02:19:05,070 --> 02:19:06,401
People will die.

1311
02:19:07,639 --> 02:19:09,607
But at that time,
those deaths won't be for revenge,

1312
02:19:09,941 --> 02:19:11,408
..but for a motive.

1313
02:19:11,810 --> 02:19:12,799
It'll be for the country.

1314
02:19:13,978 --> 02:19:17,744
Just think, if we let them go today..

1315
02:19:18,616 --> 02:19:20,641
..and they come back.

1316
02:19:20,852 --> 02:19:22,877
We'll have our entire force..

1317
02:19:22,987 --> 02:19:25,854
..but we'll also have the
army of Madhavgarh.

1318
02:19:26,524 --> 02:19:27,923
And the people here.

1319
02:19:28,226 --> 02:19:29,420
And all the kings here..

1320
02:19:29,627 --> 02:19:34,655
..Will realise how the British
enslaved them with deceit.

1321
02:19:35,100 --> 02:19:40,834
Then there won't be any deaths..
but martyrdom.

1322
02:19:41,873 --> 02:19:43,807
And it'll spread through
the entire country.

1323
02:19:47,912 --> 02:19:49,402
Today, we have the opportunity.

1324
02:19:51,816 --> 02:19:54,046
Someone will have to take this step.

1325
02:19:55,487 --> 02:19:57,819
How can we lose this opportunity..

1326
02:19:58,022 --> 02:19:59,046
..bestowed upon us by fate?

1327
02:20:00,658 --> 02:20:04,185
'Because we'll avenge the
death of 4500 Pindaris..'

1328
02:20:05,130 --> 02:20:07,564
'..by massacring that rogue king..'

1329
02:20:07,766 --> 02:20:12,635
'..and each of his British friends.'

1330
02:20:13,071 --> 02:20:14,766
'Then, I give me my word.'

1331
02:20:16,541 --> 02:20:20,204
'I'll behead the king and
each of his British friends.'

1332
02:20:20,612 --> 02:20:22,011
'Or die myself in the effort.'

1333
02:20:27,152 --> 02:20:32,886
Veer. A Pindari can never
go back on his word.

1334
02:20:40,031 --> 02:20:43,194
When it concerns the country..

1335
02:20:44,235 --> 02:20:46,226
Can you still not go
back on your word?

1336
02:20:54,145 --> 02:20:56,807
Then why didn't grandsire Bheeshma..

1337
02:20:57,015 --> 02:20:59,245
..break his promise in the
Mahabharata (Hindu epic)?

1338
02:21:01,820 --> 02:21:04,812
Fine, it will be decided
tomorrow morning..

1339
02:21:05,323 --> 02:21:07,291
..between Prithvi and Veer.

1340
02:21:35,854 --> 02:21:40,917
Listen, the people of
Pindari dynasty don't cry.

1341
02:21:46,664 --> 02:21:47,653
Veer.

1342
02:21:54,739 --> 02:21:56,673
Can't this be averted?

1343
02:21:59,477 --> 02:22:01,445
I want to live.

1344
02:22:02,480 --> 02:22:08,077
As your wife. I want to spend
my entire life with you.

1345
02:22:20,198 --> 02:22:27,070
Today, we'll live every
moment like a lifetime.

1346
02:22:45,657 --> 02:22:51,152
"You were peeking from the edges."

1347
02:22:51,863 --> 02:22:58,769
"From behind the moon."

1348
02:23:01,539 --> 02:23:06,943
"You were peeking from the edges."

1349
02:23:07,679 --> 02:23:13,584
"From behind the moon."

1350
02:23:13,952 --> 02:23:16,921
"l searched the entire world."

1351
02:23:17,121 --> 02:23:20,284
"But didn't look in the eyes."

1352
02:23:20,792 --> 02:23:26,162
"You were right in front of me."

1353
02:23:26,564 --> 02:23:29,158
"Let's soar away."

1354
02:23:29,334 --> 02:23:32,167
"Beyond the restrictions of time."

1355
02:23:32,570 --> 02:23:35,733
"Beyond the restrictions of time."

1356
02:23:35,940 --> 02:23:39,239
"Let's soar away."

1357
02:23:39,644 --> 02:23:44,240
"Try to understand what
my eyes try to convey."

1358
02:24:43,908 --> 02:24:45,205
We'll meet again.

1359
02:26:24,742 --> 02:26:28,735
Father, your son isn't
that great a warrior..

1360
02:26:30,581 --> 02:26:32,981
..to tread on this righteous path.

1361
02:26:48,933 --> 02:26:50,901
You're on the right path, Veer.

1362
02:26:52,003 --> 02:26:53,197
Pick up the sword.

1363
02:26:54,572 --> 02:26:56,802
Don't give the world
an opportunity to say..

1364
02:26:57,675 --> 02:27:01,167
..that you aren't my son.

1365
02:27:03,147 --> 02:27:04,842
Fulfill your promise.

1366
02:27:06,050 --> 02:27:09,076
And let me fulfill the promise
given to the Pindaris.

1367
02:27:23,034 --> 02:27:26,026
'What is the greatest thing
for a Pindari? - Courage.'

1368
02:27:26,370 --> 02:27:28,338
'And greater than courage?
- Promise.'

1369
02:27:28,706 --> 02:27:30,674
'And greater than a promise?
- Father.'

1370
02:27:30,875 --> 02:27:33,343
'And greater than a father?
- Father.'

1371
02:27:33,711 --> 02:27:34,609
'No.'

1372
02:27:40,284 --> 02:27:43,481
'The country is
greater than your father.'

1373
02:27:46,591 --> 02:27:49,321
'The country is
greater than father.'

1374
02:27:55,366 --> 02:27:59,462
Whoever survives will do his duty.

1375
02:29:17,915 --> 02:29:18,973
Father.

1376
02:29:55,953 --> 02:29:59,514
Veer.
- Father! No!

1377
02:30:00,858 --> 02:30:01,722
Veer.

1378
02:30:17,608 --> 02:30:18,973
Greetings, Father.

1379
02:30:39,163 --> 02:30:43,691
Father, I'll never let your
name be tarnished..

1380
02:30:44,368 --> 02:30:46,928
..as the murderer of your own son.

1381
02:30:47,371 --> 02:30:49,999
I won't let you live
with the burden..

1382
02:30:51,042 --> 02:30:54,307
..of people calling you the
murderer of your father either.

1383
02:31:37,188 --> 02:31:38,712
Little more.

1384
02:31:39,757 --> 02:31:40,883
Little more.

1385
02:31:41,092 --> 02:31:42,059
Hold it.

1386
02:31:46,597 --> 02:31:49,122
The Pindari brigade,
they're out of range.

1387
02:31:50,468 --> 02:31:52,629
I know how to get them
in the range.

1388
02:32:11,856 --> 02:32:13,721
Father.

1389
02:32:36,180 --> 02:32:37,943
Treachery!

1390
02:32:48,192 --> 02:32:50,217
Veer!

1391
02:32:54,899 --> 02:32:56,594
King, this is a crime.

1392
02:32:56,800 --> 02:32:58,563
This is the brink of slavery.

1393
02:33:01,906 --> 02:33:04,875
Father.
- Veer.

1394
02:33:06,577 --> 02:33:07,271
Veer.

1395
02:33:11,916 --> 02:33:15,317
Veer. Veer.

1396
02:33:16,086 --> 02:33:16,814
Veer. Veer.

1397
02:33:17,721 --> 02:33:19,985
You were fighting to save
these treacherous people?

1398
02:33:20,324 --> 02:33:22,053
You were fighting with us for them?

1399
02:33:22,626 --> 02:33:26,858
No. I was fighting for that.

1400
02:33:30,034 --> 02:33:31,160
Look.

1401
02:33:31,735 --> 02:33:32,827
He's fighting for us,
Your Highness.

1402
02:33:33,003 --> 02:33:34,595
The British aren't our kin.

1403
02:33:34,805 --> 02:33:36,238
We'll have to drive them
out of the entire country.

1404
02:33:36,640 --> 02:33:38,904
This is wrong. We British will
be blamed for this betrayal.

1405
02:33:39,109 --> 02:33:40,906
Shut up.
- He promised us a safe passage.

1406
02:33:41,111 --> 02:33:41,839
Commander.

1407
02:33:42,046 --> 02:33:43,911
A Rajput never
goes back on his word.

1408
02:33:45,249 --> 02:33:46,944
We should wake up and
see the truth as well.

1409
02:33:47,151 --> 02:33:49,949
Hail Mother lndia.

1410
02:33:50,187 --> 02:33:53,179
Hail Mother lndia.

1411
02:33:53,390 --> 02:33:56,826
Hail Mother lndia.

1412
02:33:57,294 --> 02:33:59,626
Just take me there.

1413
02:34:03,167 --> 02:34:05,635
Shoot them.
Come on, kill them all.

1414
02:34:12,776 --> 02:34:14,573
Open it.

1415
02:35:11,802 --> 02:35:13,793
Get them. Go, go.

1416
02:35:48,605 --> 02:35:51,165
You've an avarice for land, don't you?

1417
02:35:52,309 --> 02:35:53,241
Tell me.

1418
02:35:54,144 --> 02:35:56,009
Where do you want it?

1419
02:35:59,917 --> 02:36:01,509
I won't give you any land.

1420
02:36:03,520 --> 02:36:07,320
Because every time
a king like you..

1421
02:36:07,524 --> 02:36:09,185
..Was handed this land,
the country was enslaved.

1422
02:37:19,229 --> 02:37:24,496
Father, one day,
lndia will have only one flag.

1423
02:37:30,474 --> 02:37:31,441
Punya.

1424
02:37:47,658 --> 02:37:51,094
Father.. your daughter-in-law.

1425
02:38:13,183 --> 02:38:21,090
Father, tell mother
we'll meet again.

1426
02:38:24,628 --> 02:38:26,289
And don't you go anywhere.

1427
02:38:30,300 --> 02:38:31,665
I'll come back again.

1428
02:39:46,376 --> 02:39:51,040
Veer's sacrifice gave a new
direction to the revolution.

1429
02:39:51,248 --> 02:39:54,513
Many of the kings took
part in the freedom struggle.

1430
02:39:54,918 --> 02:39:56,545
And now, my Veer's son..

1431
02:39:56,954 --> 02:40:00,151
..is carrying forward
this freedom struggle.

1432
02:40:14,905 --> 02:40:15,894
Veer.

1433
02:40:17,841 --> 02:40:22,904
So, Veer has come as his son.

1434
02:40:25,015 --> 02:40:26,983
A Pindari had given his word.

1435
02:40:28,118 --> 02:40:29,278
He had to come.

1436
02:40:30,487 --> 02:40:32,352
My junior Veer.

1437
02:40:33,924 --> 02:40:36,484
How are you?
- Grandma.

1438
02:40:36,660 --> 02:40:39,288
You've grown old.
- I'm still better than your mother.

1439
02:40:40,063 --> 02:40:41,325
Where is grandpa?

1440
02:40:41,531 --> 02:40:42,395
Grandpa.

1441
02:40:53,110 --> 02:40:54,202
Grandpa.

1442
02:40:54,911 --> 02:40:57,209
If I get hold of you
this time around..

1443
02:40:58,281 --> 02:41:01,409
..I'll pin you down.
- Go ahead.

1444
02:41:01,585 --> 02:41:03,075
Go ahead.

1445
02:41:11,228 --> 02:41:12,889
Carefully.

1446
02:41:13,096 --> 02:41:14,961
A Pindari's eyes are filled with rage.

1447
02:41:15,165 --> 02:41:18,328
Come on. Come on.

1448
02:41:21,338 --> 02:41:22,430
Pick him up. Pick him up.

1449
02:41:23,106 --> 02:41:24,198
Pick him up.

1450
02:41:36,653 --> 02:41:40,487
Didn't I say, someday,
I'll surely throw you in the water.

1451
02:41:42,592 --> 02:41:46,119
For years, I was waiting for this.

1452
02:41:48,031 --> 02:41:52,468
Grandpa, Pindaris never shed tears.

1453
02:41:53,437 --> 02:41:54,563
I know.

1454
02:41:56,673 --> 02:41:58,368
But let me cry today.

1455
02:41:59,443 --> 02:42:01,001
Let me cry today.

1456
02:42:03,180 --> 02:42:04,306
Let me cry today.

1457
02:42:10,087 --> 02:42:13,682
"Put your hands together, Veer,
and clap your hands."

1458
02:42:16,526 --> 02:42:17,550
Click away. Click it.

1459
02:42:17,728 --> 02:42:21,687
"Put your hands together, Veer,
and clap your hands."

1460
02:42:22,065 --> 02:42:26,001
"She'll adorn herself with bindi,
henna and colour."

1461
02:42:26,203 --> 02:42:26,999
"Such attitude, that

1462
02:42:27,204 --> 02:42:33,666
"She stares at the mirror
and says, "l look beautiful."

1463
02:42:34,044 --> 02:42:42,975
"She stares, she stares,
she stares."

1464
02:42:43,186 --> 02:42:46,622
"She stares at the mirror and says,
"l look beautiful."

1465
02:42:50,527 --> 02:42:54,429
"Put your hands together, Veer,
and clap your hands."

1466
02:42:54,631 --> 02:43:00,433
"She'll adorn herself with bindi,
henna and colour."
