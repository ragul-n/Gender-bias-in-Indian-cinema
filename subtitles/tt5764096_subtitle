2
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:17,160
Yes, mister.

3
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:22,370
Welcome, welcome. Sister, all the
designs have turned old waiting for you.

4
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,540
And you're coming now.

5
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:24,580
This isn't right.

6
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:27,660
Let it be...
This isn't our age to wear new designs.

7
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,290
It's the new generation who
will flaunt their new style.

8
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:32,160
We'll just sit and watch.

9
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:33,450
- Sister.
- Yes.

10
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:34,830
Is this Mita?

11
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:36,700
She's grown up now.

12
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:38,700
- Say 'hello', dear.
- Hello.

13
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:41,000
We're all like family, dear.

14
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:43,200
Son, show her all the variety.

15
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,790
The children of today clearly
know what they want.

16
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,540
Give it, dear.

17
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:52,500
- She was saying...
- The white one.

18
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:54,200
- This is exactly how she wants it done.
- I see.

19
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:56,040
I told her that our local tailor
will sitch it for you.

20
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:02,790
Well sister,
your daughter's quite modern.

21
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:05,750
All children are
quite modern these days.

22
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:07,450
You're absolutely right.

23
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:09,830
But my son, Raj is very simple.

24
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,580
Take her measurements.

25
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:14,200
That's right.
Come here, dear.

26
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:17,950
- Shoulder; 14 Â½.
- Yes.

27
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:20,660
Wait... Yeah...

28
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:27,250
Don't you think
the back is too deep?

29
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:31,370
I will try talking to her.
Change it accordingly.

30
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,500
Mom... it'll completely
ruin the design.

31
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:39,080
We must consider the design of the
neighbourhood watch as well, Mita.

32
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,450
Right. Get the receipt.

33
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:42,290
Give her a receipt.

34
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:44,370
- Master.
- Yes...

35
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,620
Stitch a net under here.

36
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:48,750
- Hello.
- Hello.

37
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:53,450
Uncle doesn't
know much about designs.

38
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,620
I do.

39
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:00,200
I'll stitch it for you.
Same to same.

40
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:02,790
Same to same.

41
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:04,290
Same to same.

42
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:07,450
I'll come back after a couple of days.
Did you get the receipt, Mita?

43
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:08,660
- Let's go.
- Yes.

44
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,660
Don't take too long this time.

45
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,750
Don't worry at all.

46
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:16,370
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

47
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,700
Bye, dear.

48
00:03:51,410 --> 00:04:00,450
"I've been trying to spin
a web around you with my words."

49
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:10,200
"My eyes always
look for you."

50
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:19,410
"Call it my insanity or
my obsession."

51
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:28,000
"Like an angel, that's you."

52
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:37,660
"Like an angel, that's you."

53
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:52,660
"If you hear my silence..."

54
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:57,290
"They only talk about you."

55
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:02,290
"The one thing
I... always dream about..."

56
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:06,620
"is falling in love with you."

57
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:11,540
"You can call it love...

58
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:15,700
"but,
its not completely my fault."

59
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:23,870
"Like an angel, that's you."

60
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:32,870
"Like an angel, that's you."

61
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,700
Fifty percent off!
Fifty percent off!

62
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:38,790
Manish Malhotra.
Fifty percent off!

63
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:40,830
Hello, sir.

64
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:43,450
Hello madam, at least take a look.

65
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:45,870
- Madam, fifty percent off.
- Let's go.

66
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:47,830
How about we give you one
Sabyasachi free with two Abu Janis?

67
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:50,080
- Original copy?
- Absolutely original.

68
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:54,950
Isn't that amazing? Like it?

69
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,580
It's so-so...

70
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:59,450
Fine, what are you looking for?

71
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:00,870
- You know.
- Sabyasachi or Abu Jani?

72
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:02,750
- You know Deepika's...
- Tell me your range.

73
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:05,290
- You know like Kareena Kapoor.
- Or maybe the color combination.

74
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:08,500
- It's like.
- Loose or fitting?

75
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:09,620
Mum.

76
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,870
Son, why don't you finish
asking your questions first?

77
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,750
You haven't shown us
anything worth our while...

78
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:15,870
but, asked us over
a thousand questions.

79
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,870
Unbelievable, aunty.

80
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,870
I mean, a guy should know
what you're looking for.

81
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:21,660
Right?

82
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:24,200
Well, never mind. This time
I'm going to show you something

83
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:25,750
that's going to
blow your mind, away.

84
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:27,450
You won't be able to find another piece
like this in the entire city.

85
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:28,620
I guarantee you that.

86
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,410
- Show us something nice.
- Of course.

87
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:31,870
You've only been making tall claims.

88
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:34,120
Guarantee.
Here you go.

89
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:35,250
Look.

90
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,660
- Nice, isn't it?
- Isn't that amazing, huh?

91
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:44,660
You'll look really
amazing, draped in this.

92
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:48,080
It's definitely good but
first, show me the original design.

93
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,200
You will look incredible in this

94
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:52,200
- but see it for yourself.
- Show.

95
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:54,950
It's completely identical.

96
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:57,250
Can anyone say it's not?

97
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:59,160
The color is completely off.

98
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:01,290
This is 'light-white'
and that's 'bright-white'.

99
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:02,160
It's different.

100
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:03,540
The design's different, too.

101
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:07,250
Look at the fitting.
That fitting is just too good.

102
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:10,040
- Look at that girl's figure!
- Mom.

103
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:11,910
Why don't you go
sell it to her instead?

104
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,450
Stop wasting our time.

105
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:14,200
Let's go, dear.

106
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:15,790
We didn't come here
to get humiliated. OK?

107
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:17,080
If I lose two more kgs

108
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,160
I'll look hotter than Katrina.

109
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:20,160
- Believe me, aunty.
- I've told you a thousand times.

110
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:21,620
Always know your customer, Chotu.

111
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:24,120
You should know their
society before showing the variety.

112
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:26,120
You should know who's
coming from where

113
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,750
or what design they
like or what color suits them.

114
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:30,500
Once, you know that

115
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:33,660
then show one amazing
piece, that melts their heart.

116
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:36,500
Myself Raj Batra.

117
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:38,620
The owner of Batra Fashion Studio.

118
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:39,620
'Owner.'

119
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:40,910
Move.

120
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:47,500
So madam,
what would you like to see?

121
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,700
How about something
from a 'hep' designer?

122
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:52,580
Aww, you look just like Kareena.

123
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:54,750
You're going to love nothing
short of Manish Malhotra.

124
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:57,290
See mom,
I told you there's a resemblance.

125
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:01,910
Chotu, go take off Manish's skirt,
from upstairs.

126
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:04,660
That's what I showed them.

127
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,540
Fine, then get me
something from downstairs.

128
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:09,000
Get the fresh stock.
The ones we haven't opened, yet.

129
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:10,250
New?

130
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:12,410
You just have to go downstairs.

131
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:14,540
Stop asking questions
and just go get it.

132
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,660
He asks too many questions.

133
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:18,870
Tea or coffee?

134
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:20,750
Well, she's the bride

135
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:23,620
so, I think she should
stick to diet coke for a few days.

136
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,500
What about you?
What would you prefer?

137
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,160
Ice-cream sundae or buttermilk?

138
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:30,660
Well, buttermilk at this
time will be too heavy.

139
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:34,830
I think you should ask
Dolly, what she would prefer?

140
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,200
- You want to, don't you?
- You say, will you?

141
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:39,540
Do you want to?

142
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:42,000
If you order an ice-cream sundae,
I'll share it with you.

143
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:45,910
Fine, we'll keep it light.
Will share one ice-cream sundae.

144
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,160
Come on, you don't have
to be so strict with your diet?

145
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:49,040
Right.

146
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:52,620
It's a bit on the expensive side.

147
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,580
- Get an ice-cream sundae!
- Huh.

148
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:55,870
Get an ice-cream sundae!

149
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:58,250
This is a little expensive.

150
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:01,080
But,
you're going to love this stuff.

151
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,790
You see, we don't sell
this stuff at the shop.

152
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,120
It's directly delivered to VIPs.

153
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:10,950
Manish Malhotra's,
latest Bridal Collection, first copy.

154
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:13,160
Manish Malhotra!

155
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:16,580
If anyone looks better
than the bride

156
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:18,370
then he will quit designing.

157
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:22,290
Show us some more in this style.

158
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:23,660
If you see a couple more,

159
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,790
you'll want to get
married a couple of times more.

160
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:27,000
Lolz!

161
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:31,620
Get me that traditional wear.

162
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:38,620
Now this - heavy veil, traditional.

163
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:40,500
One look from
the groom's parents and

164
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,120
their hearts will melt.

165
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:48,080
This one with
backless blouse - very modern.

166
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:51,620
Once the groom lays eyes
on you, he won't be able to look away.

167
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:55,290
This is traditional and
this is modern.

168
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:58,000
Traditional! Modern!

169
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:00,620
The phone's ringing.
Get it.

170
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:03,120
Mum, he makes both sound great.

171
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,700
How about I show you another one?

172
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:07,200
I don't know which one to buy.

173
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,500
It's the Goddess calling.

174
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:12,870
Hold this.

175
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,620
Hello, yeah, I am out of here.
On the way. On the way.

176
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,660
Yeah.

177
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:19,830
Leaving?

178
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,370
- Are you leaving?
- I have to go.

179
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:25,750
But, you're leaving your customer.
It says right there, 'Customer is God'.

180
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:29,120
Customer 'is' God but,
wife is the supreme being.

181
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:31,750
"Let's go, your beloved is calling."

182
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:34,500
First, you apply the
mosquito repellent and

183
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:36,410
then you can go out and play.

184
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:39,040
But madam,
there are no mosquitoes anymore.

185
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:43,540
Mosquitoes are not
seasonal like mangoes.

186
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:45,660
I still hear news of people
suffering from dengue and malaria.

187
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:49,290
Those are from the previous season,
who haven't been treated, yet.

188
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:51,870
I see you're quite well informed.

189
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:55,700
I think you should quit as a maid
and try the Health Ministry, instead.

190
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:58,200
Mom, it's too sticky.

191
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:01,330
Pia, don't come complaining
to me when you get a sunburn.

192
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,870
This is an umbrella for your
skin, dear.

193
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,500
Didn't we see that commercial?

194
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:07,450
Come on, good girl!

195
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:08,580
One second.

196
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:14,250
Here you go, this will protect
you from any head injury.

197
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:16,290
Mom, I can't move!

198
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,750
I can't move. You'll
catch a cold, otherwise.

199
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:21,790
Madam, how's she going
to play if she's dressed like a robot?

200
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:25,330
She looks like an astronaut
preparing to go to the moon.

201
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:26,870
I'll show you, how.

202
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,620
Come on, come with me.

203
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:30,620
Come, come, come.

204
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:41,410
Now, that's clean.

205
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:43,500
Come.
Come, Pia.

206
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,450
Come, come, come.

207
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:47,080
Did you get hurt?

208
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,910
- Now you know how it's done?
- Yes, madam.

209
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:53,580
I am going out with sir.

210
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:55,660
So, give Pia a small
snack at 3:15 and

211
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:57,120
give her a bath at 4:15

212
00:11:57,330 --> 00:11:59,120
- with hot and cold water, mixed.
- Yeah.

213
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:00,040
Don't leave her hair wet and

214
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:02,830
remember to switch
off the fan and AC first.

215
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:03,870
Yes, also-

216
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,540
show her Zugululu on Chuchu TV.

217
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:07,080
But, don't let her watch
for more than 30 minutes.

218
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,450
Or her eyesight will become weak.

219
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:10,200
- Will you remember everything?
- Yes, madam.

220
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:11,370
What did I say?

221
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,750
Mitho, you are taking me for a drive
whereas I should be at the shop right now.

222
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:21,450
We're not going for a drive,
we're going to select a school for Pia.

223
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:24,250
The ONLOOK magazine has published
a list of the Top 5 schools.

224
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:27,000
Don't these people
have better stuff to do?

225
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,540
They are always coming
out with new lists.

226
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:32,080
Top 5 Restaurants,
Top 5 Holiday Resorts.

227
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,870
Raj,
let's concentrate on the school.

228
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,450
Okay.

229
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:41,950
Raj, this is Prakriti School!

230
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,910
No mugging up here.

231
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,160
You know, they teach everything
through music and dance.

232
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:46,830
Look.

233
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:51,120
62, 63, 64, 65...

234
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:52,660
What has the world come to?

235
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:53,910
Hello...

236
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,120
Back in the day, teachers
would give us a whacking.

237
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:58,500
That's what you'd expect
if you study in a government school.

238
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,910
I don't understand
these techniques, Mitho.

239
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,950
Imagine,
learning math through music.

240
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,620
You neither remember
the song nor numbers.

241
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,830
Do you know better
than 'ONLOOK' Magazine?

242
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,700
This school is in the second position
amongst the top 5 schools in the city.

243
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:12,950
Second position.

244
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,370
Suraj Valley High School.

245
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:20,500
Is this a school or a five-star hotel?

246
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,620
Why don't we take admission,
as well?

247
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,700
Well, even schools these days are
nothing short of a five-star hotel.

248
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:27,700
I see.

249
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,660
AC classrooms. Continental canteens.

250
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:32,620
And their swimming pools are-

251
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,620
Temperature controlled.

252
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:39,790
Increase or decrease,
as and when you want.

253
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,620
Can't the parents take a dip, too?

254
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:42,750
Great!

255
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,540
Our child's future
is still dicey and

256
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,000
you want to take a dip, instead.

257
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,160
Well, parents will have more fun.

258
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,830
Can you spell - 'swimming pool'?

259
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:53,870
If I do,
will they let me take a dip?

260
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,250
Fine.
Tell me, what is it?

261
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:56,750
- Swimming?
- Yeah.

262
00:13:57,410 --> 00:13:59,540
- SWIMMING.
- Yes, what is it?

263
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:03,370
- First, comes 'S'
- Yes, what next.

264
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:08,200
You can spell the rest yourself.

265
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,910
- Look...
- It's not that hard.

266
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:12,620
This is Crossroad School.

267
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:14,160
It's in the fourth position.

268
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,290
They have a tie up with Eton.

269
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:19,160
Where's Eton? Somewhere near Noida?

270
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,750
Never think beyond Delhi.

271
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
It's like a grave sin.

272
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:25,370
- Eton is in England.
- England?

273
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:27,580
How can our little
girl go to England?

274
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:29,410
- Raj.
- She isn't going to England!

275
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:31,250
Mita, I beg you.

276
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:32,540
Do what you like

277
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:33,580
but, I am not parting ways
with my child.

278
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:34,540
Who's sending her, anywhere?

279
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:36,700
- Sounds more like exile.
- Raj.

280
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:37,950
What do you want her to be,
Queen Victoria?

281
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,370
Raj, listen to me.

282
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,450
Listen to what?!
How did England come in all this?

283
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:43,450
Raj, that's the number one school -

284
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:44,540
Delhi Grammar School.

285
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:47,290
Doesn't look like number one, to me.

286
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:51,580
The biggest industrial tycoons and
politicians of this country

287
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:53,660
graduated out of this school, Raj.

288
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,700
Are they going to put
up Pia's photo here, as well?

289
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:58,250
Sure, why not?

290
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,580
But, there's one problem.

291
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:02,410
They give admission forms

292
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:04,290
to those who live close by.

293
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:05,620
Within three kilometers.

294
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:06,830
Then, why come here?

295
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,620
Our home in Chandni Chowk is
nowhere within these three kilometers.

296
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:10,950
- But,
we can be within three kilometers.

297
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,000
What?

298
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:15,870
All you've got to do,
is get a house in Vasant Vihar.

299
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:18,200
This school might
be a hundred years old

300
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:20,620
but our home wasn't
built yesterday, either.

301
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:22,500
We're not going anywhere.

302
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,540
Let's find another school.

303
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:42,700
- Mitho, let's eat.
- I am not hungry.

304
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,040
Get up.

305
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:55,250
Let me sleep, please.

306
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:56,660
Come on let's eat.

307
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:57,910
Come on.

308
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,700
Raj, I am not in the mood.
Please let me sleep.

309
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:01,910
I know how to fix your mood.

310
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:05,080
The only way to fix
my mood is to move to Vasant Vihar.

311
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:09,790
Isn't there any other way
apart from moving to Vasant Vihar?

312
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:11,660
What other way?

313
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:14,540
We can't let Pia study

314
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:16,200
in the same government
school, we did.

315
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:19,290
- Mitho, we're doing well.
- Raj.

316
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:21,870
Just doing well, isn't enough.

317
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,540
She won't learn anything
in a government school.

318
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:26,660
Poor thing will be afraid
of speaking to anyone.

319
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:29,080
She'll be terrified
if anyone speaks in English.

320
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,540
She will be a misfit in society.

321
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:31,830
Then, she will be
lonely and depressed.

322
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:35,080
- What if she starts doing drugs?
- Hold on.

323
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:37,620
Stop predicting her future.

324
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,870
English isn't just a language
in this country, it's a 'class'.

325
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:44,540
The best way
to be a part of this class,

326
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:46,200
is to study in a good school.

327
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:52,120
We can't let Pia endure,
what we did.

328
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:01,370
Stay in touch.

329
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,290
You must come for Montu's wedding.

330
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:05,580
We'll be sending the
bride away, in your car.

331
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:07,290
Okay.

332
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,660
- See you.
- Bye.

333
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:15,620
Take care.

334
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,790
You're leaving, Raj.

335
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,580
This time we'll be
casting someone else

336
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:21,250
for the role of
Jatayu in 'Ramleela'.

337
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:22,830
Do you hear, what he's saying?

338
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,120
I'll set the stage on fire.

339
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,910
Just try and cast someone else.

340
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:32,660
Raj, shall we?

341
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:38,870
Brother Raj! Brother Raj!

342
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,580
Mom has sent some snacks for you.

343
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:46,790
Raj, shall we?

344
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:47,950
Come on.

345
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:51,950
Billoo, tie the luggage properly.

346
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:56,620
Oh Raj, even I wasn't
so emotional during my wedding.

347
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:08,000
Raj... take care.

348
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,790
Come. Come.

349
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:37,870
Careful. that's glassware,
careful with that!

350
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:54,000
Careful, that's my grandpa!

351
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:57,000
Oh my God!

352
00:18:57,290 --> 00:18:59,870
Raj, what a beautiful home!

353
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:04,160
Thank you so much.
Thank you, I loved it!

354
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:05,660
What's wrong, darling?

355
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:08,410
How will we adjust here, Mitho?

356
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:09,700
There's nothing around here.

357
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:11,620
There's no courtyard in the house.

358
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:12,790
Courtyard?

359
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:17,200
Why will you miss a courtyard
when I'm here?

360
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:19,120
I love you, baby.

361
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:21,040
Madam, where do I keep this TV?

362
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:24,660
Raj, are we going to keep this

363
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,700
or get a new one in exchange?

364
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,120
We already changed our house, now
you're changing the TV,

365
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,500
just don't change me next, Mitho.

366
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:37,000
Raj, you're in Vasant Vihar now.

367
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:39,790
You must get rid of
your Chandni Chowk style.

368
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:43,750
And please stop calling me Mitho.

369
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:47,000
Huh? What else should I call you?

370
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:50,250
You can call me...

371
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:51,700
What will you call me?

372
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:53,620
Honey.

373
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:04,700
Yeah, that will be alright?

374
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,620
- What?
- Honey.

375
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:07,500
Honey?

376
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:09,000
We must change everything, Raj?

377
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:12,330
Otherwise, no one will
befriend Pia because of you.

378
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:14,660
Do kids here judge fathers
before becoming friends?

379
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,830
Sometimes they befriend you
based on your car.

380
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:18,120
This is high society, sir.

381
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:20,290
I don't see any kids
playing around here.

382
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:21,750
How will she make friends?

383
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,950
Don't worry, I've
a plan for that, too.

384
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:30,750
At least, tell me
where to keep this TV.

385
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,120
Take it home, Honey's busy.

386
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:34,580
Oh man...

387
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:43,870
Whiskey for the gentleman.

388
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,330
Juice for the lady.

389
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,370
What's this... looks like sweetmeat?

390
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:50,200
Caviar, sir. Beluga Caviar.

391
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,000
- How is it, sir?
- Tastes great.

392
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,950
- What's in it?
- Fish eggs, sir.

393
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,330
Oh no...

394
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:01,660
You know what, get me some fritters.

395
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,450
Fritters,
pizza, burger... get those for me.

396
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:04,700
- Don't bring this again.
- Sure.

397
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:05,500
Take it away.

398
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:07,870
It's going to take some
time to acquire a taste for it.

399
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:10,500
- Oh man...
- Who told you to eat that?

400
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,040
Listen...

401
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:16,910
Don't serve your local stuff
in the imported whiskey bottles?

402
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,910
Don't be so stressed,
Mitho... it's a party.

403
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Let's have some fun.

404
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,580
I didn't throw this party for fun,
sweetheart?

405
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,870
- Chill out.
- It's for Pia to make new friends.

406
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,950
- She will... she will...
- So that she can mix with the crowd.

407
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,290
Chill, sweetheart.

408
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:30,160
- Excuse me, ma'am.
- Yeah.

409
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:32,160
- Suris are here.
- Oh, okay.

410
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:33,200
Come, Raj.

411
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:34,950
Leave that.

412
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:40,250
Come-come-come...

413
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,660
- You.
- Hi, Kabir.

414
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,160
What are you doing here?

415
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,160
Well, you invited Ayaan
so his father will come along too.

416
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:51,410
Oh... I see.

417
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:52,870
- Hi.
- Hi...

418
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,330
This is my wife, Aarti.

419
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:55,500
- Hi.
- Hello.

420
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,000
My husband.

421
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,290
- Myself Raj Batra.
- Hello.

422
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:00,830
Owner of Batra Fashion Studio.

423
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:02,450
Here you go...

424
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:04,290
This is for you.

425
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:05,830
Ohh... thank you.

426
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:07,450
What would you like to have,
my dear?

427
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,330
Please... everything's imported.

428
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:12,290
I'll have a Mojito.

429
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:16,000
Hey man... come here.

430
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,000
Ask her what she wants.

431
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,410
- Do you drink whiskey?
- Yes.

432
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:21,540
- How about a large?
- Sure.

433
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:22,540
Come on, I'll make one for you.

434
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:23,200
Come...

435
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:26,410
Come here.

436
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,500
So, you guys know each other?

437
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:29,620
Just went to the same college...

438
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:32,370
Come in,
please... don't just stand there.

439
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,080
Yeah... come.

440
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:48,250
Papa... papa... papa... it's our song.

441
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:53,830
"I stay awake at night missing
you and counting stars."

442
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:57,080
"I cannot stop
my tears of sorrows."

443
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:00,330
"I stay awake at night missing
you and counting stars."

444
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:03,660
"I cannot stop my
tears of sorrow."

445
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:12,200
"Your love makes me suffer!"

446
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:17,200
"Your love makes me suffer!"

447
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:22,160
"Your love makes me suffer!"

448
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:27,160
"Your love makes me suffer!"

449
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,040
Oh no!

450
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:43,200
Wait, I'll be right back.
I'll fix the fuse.

451
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:46,870
Oh, God... not a blown fuse...

452
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:48,500
What are you doing?

453
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:49,580
What happened?

454
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:51,330
There's no blown fuse...
I turned off the electricity.

455
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:52,000
Why?

456
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:54,450
What was that awful dance
you were doing in there?

457
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,410
Its Pia's favorite song.

458
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:58,870
She's having so much
fun... everyone's having fun.

459
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,660
No one's having fun,
Raj... they are making fun of you.

460
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,700
I don't know why you
don't understand this.

461
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:10,370
You're out of Chandni
Chowk, Raj, but...

462
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,370
Chandni Chowk isn't out of you.

463
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:13,950
This is terrible.

464
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:21,370
- Fine, I won't dance...
- Please. Please. Don't...

465
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:22,790
For my sake.

466
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:27,330
Fine... Come,
let's get back to the party. Come on.

467
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:29,540
- Let's go upstairs.
- Just a minute, I'll be with you.

468
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:30,450
You go.

469
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:35,500
- Chill.
- Raj, I said I am coming.

470
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:36,500
Fine.

471
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,410
I didn't expect that.

472
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,200
- Come on...
- Once more.

473
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:45,750
Once more... once more...

474
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:47,910
No more dance.

475
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,120
- Come on.
- Come on, Raj.

476
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:52,290
- No more dancing.
- You dance really well.

477
00:24:52,410 --> 00:24:54,450
Well... I've been
banned from dancing.

478
00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:57,410
- Hey mister, change the song.
- Okay sir.

479
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:58,830
- Play something else.
- Sure.

480
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:09,290
Mom.

481
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,040
Mom.

482
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:14,540
What happened?
Why are you crying?

483
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:15,700
Weren't you playing?

484
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:19,290
- No one's playing with me.
- Did you fight?

485
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:22,000
No, I didn't fight.

486
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:24,040
Okay, stop crying.

487
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:26,500
I'll go ask why they
are not playing with you.

488
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:27,580
Come with me.

489
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,080
Hey, kids.

490
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:32,830
Hi.

491
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:36,830
- Why don't you play with Pia?
- She talks in Hindi.

492
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:39,370
Why don't you talk
in Hindi as well?

493
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:42,290
Mom says don't talk in Hindi.

494
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:46,330
But Pia's your best friend, son.
She just wants to play with you.

495
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:48,830
I also want to marry him...

496
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:52,790
- but for that we need to talk.
- She's got a point.

497
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:55,200
Come Ayaan, let's go home.

498
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:58,080
Why do you forbidding the
kids from speaking in Hindi?

499
00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:00,250
Is it a bad habit to talk in Hindi?

500
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:02,120
No-no-no, it's not a bad habit.

501
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:05,750
- But it's not allowed in their school.
- I see...

502
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,830
But this isn't school,
you don't need to worry so much.

503
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:09,870
I know.

504
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,540
But you don't need to
worry about school either.

505
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:15,290
You can send her anywhere.

506
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:17,200
It doesn't really matter.

507
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:20,330
Meaning?

508
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:25,200
I mean... you guys own
a shop in Chandni Chowk.

509
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:28,080
And your kids will also continue
doing just that.

510
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:30,410
But our kids can't do that.

511
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:33,330
We send them to top
schools of Delhi...

512
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:36,250
so that they can do
something when they grow up.

513
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:37,790
Build their future.

514
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:43,080
Pia will definitely do
something with her life too.

515
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:47,500
And your kids aren't the
only ones going to 'elite' schools.

516
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:49,790
Soon Pia will be going there too.

517
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:51,330
Come, Pia.

518
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:56,750
- What was that?
- 'Elite.'

519
00:26:57,410 --> 00:26:59,120
Mom, it's hurting.

520
00:26:59,290 --> 00:27:01,540
Pia, from now on only English.

521
00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:03,500
Mom, it's hurting.

522
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:13,160
Delhi's biggest
race begins tomorrow.

523
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:16,080
And I am not
talking about any marathon.

524
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:19,410
I am talking about Delhi
school nursery admissions.

525
00:27:19,870 --> 00:27:23,120
Fourteen schools will start distributing
their forms from tomorrow.

526
00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:26,200
Let's see which
parents win this race.

527
00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:16,290
- Is there a queue?
- Yes.

528
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,120
- Queue for the admission?
- Yes?

529
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:19,750
- For the admission form?
- Yes...

530
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:23,250
Hey mister, these 253 people
don't enjoy standing in a queue.

531
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:25,080
- Right.
- Come on... behind me.

532
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:25,700
What?

533
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:28,500
- You're no. 254.
- Did you come early morning?

534
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:29,870
Yes, I came at 5 am.

535
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,250
I've been standing
here since 4 am.

536
00:28:31,330 --> 00:28:34,830
I got in the queue at
12:00 am... haven't moved since.

537
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,870
You haven't gone
anywhere since 12:00 am?

538
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:41,790
- I came prepared.
- This is madness.

539
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,000
It's not madness,
it's school admission.

540
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:55,290
- Hello.
- Raj. What about lunch?

541
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:57,410
I had a big portion of
pushing and shoving, sweetheart.

542
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:58,620
Guess there's still more to come.

543
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,000
Is the queue that long?

544
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,870
Yes it is that long because
there are so many quotas.

545
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:06,120
There are quotas for the
alumni, a quota for siblings.

546
00:29:06,290 --> 00:29:08,290
Ordinary people like us are just
condemned to standing in queues.

547
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:10,790
And even if we get the form admission
will be on the basis of observation.

548
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:12,080
Observation?

549
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,580
Observation is another
word for interviews.

550
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:16,450
Keep moving mister,
this is not a barber shop.

551
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:17,620
Oh, I see!

552
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:20,330
Okay... just get the form.

553
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:22,000
We'll see what to do next.

554
00:29:26,290 --> 00:29:27,040
Mom.

555
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,160
You studied at Delhi Grammar School,
didn't you?

556
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:33,410
Can you put in a
recommendation for Pia?

557
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:37,200
Admission in Delhi Grammar School?!

558
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:38,410
Okay...

559
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:42,950
But such an approach...

560
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:45,120
can be more
negative than positive.

561
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:49,410
- But...
- So you can't help, right?

562
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:52,410
Did I say that?

563
00:30:01,410 --> 00:30:02,910
There's a way.

564
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:06,830
I am sending you the
number of a consultant.

565
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:10,040
Consultant? For nursery admission?

566
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:13,870
Trust me... she's helped
a lot of parents get admission.

567
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:21,250
That's your sheet, Mrs.
Batra, and that's yours.

568
00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:24,700
10:00 am will be a
basic math class, okay?

569
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:27,370
And at 12 will be a
swimming class at the club.

570
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:28,750
At 2 English class.

571
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:31,040
At 4...
basic good manners and habits...

572
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,080
What's she saying...

573
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,370
- Is there a problem?
- No-no, it's nothing.

574
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:38,410
Okay. At 6 o'clock is the
Art and Music class at the Gallery.

575
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:42,830
Actually... all the classes
are so connected...

576
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:46,200
I mean... when will she eat or sleep?

577
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,040
When will she eat or sleep!

578
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:55,750
Like I said
before... you're too late.

579
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:58,410
Parents book me during pregnancy.

580
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,080
During the first trimester.

581
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:01,450
Pregnancy?

582
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,870
Your kid has a lot of catching
up to do. You understand, right?

583
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:07,080
- She's a bright kid.
- Of course.

584
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,120
She won't need all these classes.

585
00:31:09,290 --> 00:31:11,290
Pia... Pia, come here child.

586
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,200
Come, dear.

587
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:15,410
Tell her a poem, child.

588
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:18,160
- Tell aunty a poem... poem.
- English poem, Raj. English poem.

589
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:19,250
Tell her a poem, child.

590
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:20,750
Two lines at a time.

591
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:22,950
- Come on, child...
- Come on.

592
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,080
Come on, child...

593
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,250
Children always humiliate
you at the right time.

594
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,330
Come on, dear...

595
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:31,330
She keeps chanting all the time otherwise.
But never when we tell her to.

596
00:31:31,410 --> 00:31:32,950
- Come on, dear...
- It's okay.

597
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,790
She will when she is ready.

598
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:35,700
Come.

599
00:31:35,910 --> 00:31:37,950
- You know, we've all kinds of toys here.
- Thank you.

600
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:41,950
Sensory toys,
discovery toys... STEM toys.

601
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,950
Whatever you want Pia.

602
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:47,870
Oho dinosaur!

603
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:50,160
Aara, we have friends here.

604
00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:51,160
Hello.

605
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:53,160
- Two dinosaurs?
- Yes.

606
00:31:53,330 --> 00:31:56,910
This one's a Tyrannosaurus
Rex and this one is a Stegosaurus.

607
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,830
I see... which one's going to win?

608
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:02,540
Obviously Tyrannosaurus,
It's a carnivore.

609
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:04,750
Wonderful Aara, superb.

610
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:07,160
Good morning, Parth.

611
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:12,620
- Buonas dias! Bonjour! Guten morgen!
- Morgen.

612
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:16,410
- [SPEAKS IN GERMAN]
- Yeah.

613
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:17,870
Super.

614
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:19,250
What did he say?

615
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:22,000
One language is never enough,
Mr. Batra.

616
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,830
He's trilingual... and
a sitar player as well.

617
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,200
I see...

618
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:29,950
He's performed at that
India International Centre,

619
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,410
just last month.

620
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:35,120
Your child will be competing
with these children.

621
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:38,160
"Twinkle-Twinkle little star."

622
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:40,120
"How I wonder what you are."

623
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,500
Yes, dear... what you are.

624
00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:43,660
What you are is what you are.

625
00:32:45,370 --> 00:32:47,660
Dhruv, I can see you.
Don't bite your nails.

626
00:32:47,910 --> 00:32:48,830
Come...

627
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:52,950
- Fine... we'll send our child.
- Great.

628
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:55,540
- So when can she start?
- Right now.

629
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:57,080
But it won't be just Pia...

630
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,870
in fact, you two will
also have to undergo training.

631
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:02,250
No-no... we don't want any training.
It's her admission. Train the kid.

632
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:03,370
She will work hard.

633
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:05,250
We can pay you extra.

634
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:09,120
Sure. If that's what you'd like,
Mr. Batra.

635
00:33:09,290 --> 00:33:10,700
- No problem...
- No...

636
00:33:10,910 --> 00:33:12,750
But... if you don't get training...

637
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:15,950
then, Pia won't get admission
in a good nursery school.

638
00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:18,540
And if she doesn't
get into a top school...

639
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:20,700
then, she's not going
to get into any good college...

640
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:22,120
anywhere in the country.

641
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:25,870
And without a good
college on her resume...

642
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:28,370
she's not going
to get a job in an MNC.

643
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:31,830
And without a good job... all
her friends will surpass her.

644
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:32,910
Exactly.

645
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:35,080
And she will be left alone.

646
00:33:35,370 --> 00:33:36,370
Exactly.

647
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:39,200
And if she's left alone,
she will think she's a failure.

648
00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:40,160
She will be depressed.

649
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:43,290
- And what if she starts doing drugs?
- Wait-wait...

650
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:45,660
We'll do whatever you want us to do,
tell us what to do.

651
00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:47,790
- Great...
- What to do?

652
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:51,410
So the first step is... filling
the school application form.

653
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:57,660
Remember, Mr. Batra. This
is the first round of elimination.

654
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:02,790
One word can make
or break Pia's life.

655
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:05,500
Yes.

656
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:06,790
- Great.
- Thank you.

657
00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:08,160
- See you tomorrow.
- Yes.

658
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:12,330
It's been 25 years.

659
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:16,790
Time for Maharathi(MYTHICAL PLACE)
to come on this side of the wall.

660
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:21,290
Only a mystical serpent
could break this wall.

661
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:22,910
And so I did.

662
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:26,160
She's forgotten
all about Maharathi.

663
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:28,080
She doesn't even remember
it's been 25 years.

664
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,410
Raj...

665
00:34:31,290 --> 00:34:32,160
Raj...

666
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:36,750
- Raj, are you listening?
- Yeah...

667
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,250
What yeah?

668
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:41,790
Raj, what are you doing?

669
00:34:41,910 --> 00:34:43,620
Just a minute,
Honey... just one minute.

670
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:45,040
Just turn that off.

671
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:47,200
The serpent is about to take revenge.

672
00:34:48,450 --> 00:34:50,870
I've filled the form.
Just go through it once.

673
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:53,160
If someone asks you,
you should know what's in it.

674
00:34:53,290 --> 00:34:54,290
Okay.

675
00:34:54,830 --> 00:34:57,160
- Don't forget to take a look.
- Okay.

676
00:34:57,330 --> 00:34:58,580
I am going to bed.

677
00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:02,200
Go spill your poison.

678
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:05,830
She did it... She did it!

679
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,120
Profile of the child.

680
00:35:11,450 --> 00:35:12,370
Pia Batra.

681
00:35:12,450 --> 00:35:13,580
Pia has a...

682
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:18,790
curious nature.

683
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:23,540
She is always asking... question.

684
00:35:25,450 --> 00:35:29,580
What is this? This isn't working.

685
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:42,200
'Rapidex...'
Yeah, this one's right...

686
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:50,450
Pia has an... inspecting
nature... which is important...

687
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:53,950
substance...

688
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,750
- May I?
- Yeah.

689
00:35:55,870 --> 00:35:56,410
Thanks.

690
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:57,830
- Please...
- Raj, let me...

691
00:35:57,950 --> 00:35:58,950
Allow me.

692
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:03,250
Pia has inspecting nature.

693
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:08,830
She has important substance
in her body language.

694
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,830
She questions every answer,
every object, every item.

695
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:17,410
She exams... new things.

696
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:21,330
She inspection on
everything... actions-reactions.

697
00:36:21,790 --> 00:36:24,750
She is very-very specialist child.

698
00:36:25,790 --> 00:36:27,620
- Okay.
- Finished?

699
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:28,870
Yeah...

700
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,080
Did you write it?

701
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:37,450
Surprised, aren't you?

702
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:41,000
I spent the entire night... scanned
through the entire dictionary.

703
00:36:42,290 --> 00:36:45,910
This is George, he's a writer.
He will help you.

704
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,330
- Help?
- Yeah.

705
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:49,290
It wasn't right?

706
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:54,620
Full marks for the effort Mr. Batra,
but this is not going to work.

707
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,040
Understand that.

708
00:37:06,410 --> 00:37:07,250
Pia.

709
00:37:07,410 --> 00:37:12,750
She has a maturity about her, that
is balanced by a bewitching charm...

710
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:15,950
and a delightful sense of humor.

711
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:19,410
She is everything a parent could want.

712
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:24,120
Bright, industrious... but
most importantly to us...

713
00:37:24,410 --> 00:37:26,410
honest and humble.

714
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:31,200
We're very blessed to
have Pia as our daughter.

715
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:38,950
Wonderful, sir... simply wonderful.

716
00:37:39,330 --> 00:37:42,620
I could hardly recognize
it was our daughter.

717
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,500
Kiddo, give your father a kiss.

718
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:46,620
I love Pia a lot.

719
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:50,250
But I am completely impressed by her.

720
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,120
Thank you, sir.

721
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:02,620
Pia's impressed everyone.

722
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,250
Now it's our turn.

723
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:35,370
Send it to me, and I'll revert back.
You've to send me something, yeah...

724
00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:37,000
Send me the spreadsheet, and I'll...

725
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,200
I will...

726
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:45,620
I'll call you back.

727
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:53,620
Wow.

728
00:38:55,450 --> 00:38:57,830
Wow... amazing.

729
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:02,250
You two look like a brand store.

730
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:05,950
- Exactly. We own a brand store.
- Right.

731
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:09,290
We thought... we should
get the upper-class feel as well.

732
00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:11,870
Otherwise, we'll look different in
comparison to the other parents.

733
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:12,660
Right.

734
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:15,370
Well... you two are looking different.

735
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:19,120
But you see... rich
people don't show off.

736
00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:20,700
'Less is more.'

737
00:39:21,870 --> 00:39:22,870
'Less is more?'

738
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,000
Less is more...

739
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:26,830
I'll just call someone
who will explain it to you.

740
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:27,910
Hello.

741
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:31,200
Hi, darling. I know you're
really exhausted after fashion week...

742
00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:34,410
But there are two people
who really need your help.

743
00:39:35,330 --> 00:39:36,200
Help?

744
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:40,370
Yeah... thanks, darling, I owe you.
Big time.

745
00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:41,830
Okay, bye.

746
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:44,330
Lucius is going to help you.

747
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:49,200
Before you leave just come
to my office and take the number.

748
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:50,580
What's the problem?

749
00:39:52,370 --> 00:39:56,410
Okay... it's a mock interview,
but take it seriously.

750
00:39:56,830 --> 00:39:57,370
Okay.

751
00:39:57,580 --> 00:39:58,620
Ready?

752
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:00,950
Okay.

753
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:06,330
If your child refuses to go to school,
what will you do?

754
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:12,410
Well... we'll definitely
not hit or scold her.

755
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,910
That's a relief, very good.

756
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:20,290
We'll say "If you go to school,
we'll give you a lollypop".

757
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:23,250
- What?
- Lollypop.

758
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:26,790
- Lollypop?
- Lollypop.

759
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:31,700
What... is wrong with you, Mr. Batra?

760
00:40:32,370 --> 00:40:34,250
How can you do that?

761
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:36,290
Bribing is not right.

762
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:41,000
I mean... you can't offer her
a lollypop to send her to school.

763
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:45,080
- Bribing is not right.
- Right.

764
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:48,160
We'll ask her why she
doesn't want to go to school.

765
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:50,000
Because you see, sometimes...

766
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:54,200
what appears small to us, might
be of a bigger problem to children.

767
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:55,000
Yeah...

768
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:57,370
But no matter what,
bribing the child is not right.

769
00:41:04,330 --> 00:41:06,410
This is my favorite question.

770
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,250
How will you introduce the
concept of 'Poverty' to your child?

771
00:41:12,330 --> 00:41:16,160
Why do... we need to introduce poverty?

772
00:41:16,450 --> 00:41:19,580
Doesn't that exist
everywhere in our country?

773
00:41:19,870 --> 00:41:23,830
We've beggars at every nook
and corner begging for alms...

774
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:26,040
- We won't need to introduce them.
- Right.

775
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,040
Think these things if you want,
but please...

776
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:32,200
don't say such
things in the interview.

777
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,950
If they ask you this question...

778
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:39,370
just say "Sharing
is Caring" and then...

779
00:41:42,410 --> 00:41:43,200
Sharing is Caring.

780
00:41:43,290 --> 00:41:45,290
- Sharing is Caring.
- Very good.

781
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:47,330
Smile.

782
00:41:48,370 --> 00:41:50,450
We'll take the kid to the orphanage.

783
00:41:50,790 --> 00:41:51,950
Orphanage.

784
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:53,250
Orphanage.

785
00:41:53,410 --> 00:41:55,330
We'll take her to the orphanage...

786
00:41:55,410 --> 00:41:57,950
and ask her to share her toys
with the underprivileged children...

787
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:59,200
so that she understands.

788
00:41:59,370 --> 00:42:00,750
Because Caring is Sharing.

789
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:03,620
- Sharing...
- Huh.

790
00:42:03,790 --> 00:42:05,160
- Sharing.
- That's what I said.

791
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:07,040
First 'sharing' then 'caring'.

792
00:42:09,370 --> 00:42:11,000
Because Sharing is...

793
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:13,500
What was it?

794
00:42:20,250 --> 00:42:22,000
Lord, the interview was amazing...

795
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:23,830
let the result be just as great.

796
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:25,870
Offerings every Tuesday.

797
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:29,700
Offerings every Tuesday.

798
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:37,290
Lord... it's a very humble request.

799
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:40,000
Offerings every morning.

800
00:42:40,830 --> 00:42:44,500
I just want my child
to get an admission. Please.

801
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:53,910
I'll offer a blanket every Sunday.

802
00:42:54,410 --> 00:42:57,120
Just get my child the admission.
Please-please-please.

803
00:42:57,370 --> 00:43:01,000
Jesus, please let my
child get the admission.

804
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:04,040
I will fire candle
every Sunday in church.

805
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:05,790
Please let her get the admission.

806
00:43:09,250 --> 00:43:11,790
Listen, we've been
praying to so many Gods...

807
00:43:11,870 --> 00:43:13,330
I hope it doesn't
cause a problem later.

808
00:43:13,410 --> 00:43:15,160
Someone will answer our prayers, Raj.

809
00:43:15,250 --> 00:43:18,370
I mean I hope the Gods
don't push it on each other...

810
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:19,870
saying "You do it".

811
00:43:27,870 --> 00:43:28,790
Wait-wait...

812
00:43:28,870 --> 00:43:29,870
Let me see...

813
00:43:29,950 --> 00:43:31,040
Mister.. move..

814
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:32,620
- Mister, you've left your mobile behind...
- Where?

815
00:43:32,830 --> 00:43:33,370
Outside.

816
00:43:33,450 --> 00:43:34,160
What are you saying?

817
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:35,830
Move... move, mister...

818
00:43:35,950 --> 00:43:37,620
Mister, you have dropped
your wallet on the floor.

819
00:43:37,870 --> 00:43:39,250
Move...
Mister...

820
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:40,500
Mister...

821
00:43:41,250 --> 00:43:43,790
- Oh... 252.
- 254.

822
00:43:43,910 --> 00:43:45,250
- Did you get it?
- Raj...

823
00:43:45,410 --> 00:43:47,450
- We got in.
- Raj, let's check ahead.

824
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:48,540
Come-come...

825
00:43:48,750 --> 00:43:49,870
Move... mister, please...

826
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:51,330
That's the wrong list...

827
00:43:51,410 --> 00:43:54,160
Move... move, back.
Principal... coming through.

828
00:43:54,290 --> 00:43:56,450
- What are you doing?
- Move... move...

829
00:43:56,580 --> 00:43:58,370
- Check her name.
- Yes.

830
00:44:01,870 --> 00:44:03,750
- Look on the right.
- Yes.

831
00:44:05,830 --> 00:44:08,540
How can you see it?
You can't even spell 'Admission'.

832
00:44:08,750 --> 00:44:11,170
But I can spell
Pia... you're just too much.

833
00:44:11,250 --> 00:44:12,500
- You see it...
- Move.

834
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:15,830
Pia... Pia...

835
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:17,830
Do you see it?

836
00:44:18,790 --> 00:44:19,370
Do you see it?

837
00:44:19,450 --> 00:44:21,450
Pia... Pia...

838
00:44:21,750 --> 00:44:23,910
Where are you looking?

839
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,250
Move, mister... please, move...

840
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:38,750
It's okay.

841
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:40,250
This is not the last one.

842
00:44:40,370 --> 00:44:41,870
We've got four more schools to go.

843
00:44:43,870 --> 00:44:45,870
The consultant said
we shouldn't panic.

844
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:47,250
Don't panic.

845
00:44:47,450 --> 00:44:48,410
Don't panic.

846
00:44:49,580 --> 00:44:50,870
Can we panic now?

847
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:53,000
Four schools have
declared their results...

848
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:54,500
but Pia's name wasn't
in any one of them.

849
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:57,160
Only Delhi Grammar School is left now.

850
00:44:57,620 --> 00:44:59,700
You even made us undergo
training for Pia's sake.

851
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:02,540
And the interviews were
great... so what was the problem?

852
00:45:04,540 --> 00:45:07,120
There is no problem with your child.

853
00:45:07,250 --> 00:45:08,790
Then what is the problem?

854
00:45:10,370 --> 00:45:13,700
The school doesn't want to give
admission to shopkeepers' children.

855
00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:19,540
Madam, it's not some tailor's shop.

856
00:45:19,790 --> 00:45:21,580
It's a fashion studio.

857
00:45:21,870 --> 00:45:24,790
I am a businessman.
They call me the local tycoon.

858
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:26,790
You may be a business tycoon...

859
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:30,330
but the schools think,
if the parents aren't well-educated...

860
00:45:30,410 --> 00:45:34,700
they won't pay much attention
to their children's education.

861
00:45:34,950 --> 00:45:36,370
How can they say such a thing?

862
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:41,250
Look... we're very serious
about our child's education.

863
00:45:41,620 --> 00:45:44,830
It's not me... the schools feel this.

864
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:46,580
You must understand it's not personal.

865
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:48,160
And don't worry.

866
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:50,450
I've made a list of some more schools.

867
00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:51,700
A 'B-List'

868
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:54,580
Keep these B-list schools to yourself.

869
00:45:56,290 --> 00:45:57,290
Come, Mita.

870
00:45:57,540 --> 00:45:59,450
I'll show you what a businessman is.

871
00:46:06,250 --> 00:46:07,170
So Mr. Batra, what's up?

872
00:46:07,250 --> 00:46:08,450
- All fine at the shop?
- Well...

873
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:11,410
- No problem with the MCD.
- No-no...

874
00:46:11,830 --> 00:46:13,250
The way you politicians
understand people,

875
00:46:13,370 --> 00:46:15,870
even people don't understand
themselves as well.

876
00:46:16,450 --> 00:46:18,040
That's exactly why we're
here... at your service.

877
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:19,370
Well... go on, tell me.

878
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:21,120
- I want a small favor.
- Yes.

879
00:46:21,250 --> 00:46:23,170
You must have heard
of Delhi Grammar School.

880
00:46:23,250 --> 00:46:25,410
Yes, everyone has.
It's the best school in the city.

881
00:46:25,540 --> 00:46:26,750
- Best?
- Yes...

882
00:46:28,370 --> 00:46:30,160
Well... I wanted my child
to get admission in that school...

883
00:46:30,250 --> 00:46:32,450
so, if I can get
a letter from the CM.

884
00:46:33,370 --> 00:46:37,290
You see... Mr. Batra,
getting a letter is not a problem.

885
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:40,410
But you must understand
it won't do you any good.

886
00:46:40,660 --> 00:46:41,370
What?

887
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:46,000
You see... once
I got a letter...

888
00:46:46,250 --> 00:46:49,450
from the PM's office
for someone's child's admission.

889
00:46:50,330 --> 00:46:53,830
But Delhi Grammar School's
principal... is very strict.

890
00:46:54,250 --> 00:46:55,950
She tore the letter in half.

891
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:05,870
Let it be, Mr. Batra... why
don't you apply for a liquor license.

892
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,450
I'll get it in 2 days.

893
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:11,250
How about a gun license?

894
00:47:11,410 --> 00:47:13,250
Everyone's carrying one these days.

895
00:47:13,910 --> 00:47:15,160
So you can't do it?

896
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:28,170
What do you think this is?
A vegetable market?

897
00:47:28,250 --> 00:47:32,040
Sorry, ma'am, I thought this
is how it normally works...

898
00:47:32,370 --> 00:47:34,620
Ma'am, I was only giving a donation...

899
00:47:34,790 --> 00:47:38,080
Do you think this is a joke? How
dare you trot in with a bag of money?

900
00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:39,750
If I call the cops now...

901
00:47:39,870 --> 00:47:41,790
they will teach you a lesson.

902
00:47:42,410 --> 00:47:45,790
If I ever see you
on this campus again...

903
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,370
then, I will blacklist your kid.

904
00:47:48,450 --> 00:47:50,500
And she won't get admission
anywhere in Delhi.

905
00:47:50,910 --> 00:47:52,160
Don't just stand there. Get out!

906
00:47:52,250 --> 00:47:54,330
- Let's go.
- Sorry... sorry.

907
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,660
- Send the next appointment in.
- Yes.

908
00:48:00,330 --> 00:48:01,450
Raj Batra.

909
00:48:04,830 --> 00:48:05,830
Raj Batra.

910
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:07,750
Who is Raj Batra?

911
00:48:09,580 --> 00:48:11,450
- Deepak Dhingra.
- Yes, sir.

912
00:48:11,790 --> 00:48:12,500
Come.

913
00:48:30,410 --> 00:48:34,040
Hey Honey... why are
you sitting in the dark?

914
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:37,080
Weren't you supposed
to go for a kitty party?

915
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:39,250
What happened?

916
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:43,120
- I had to cancel my plan.
- Why?

917
00:48:44,330 --> 00:48:45,330
What happened?

918
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,450
The mothers whose children
go to Prakriti School...

919
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:50,910
have a separate kitty party group.

920
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:53,330
So does the New Capital School.

921
00:48:53,620 --> 00:48:55,700
My child didn't get
into any of these schools.

922
00:48:56,370 --> 00:48:57,580
So which kitty party do I attend!

923
00:48:57,910 --> 00:48:59,870
Even the kitty parties
are being decided.

924
00:48:59,950 --> 00:49:02,000
on the basis of children's
school... that's too much.

925
00:49:02,250 --> 00:49:03,540
Forget it, Raj.

926
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:06,200
These kitty parties don't
make a difference to me.

927
00:49:08,290 --> 00:49:09,750
How about some good news?

928
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,580
Any progress on the admission?

929
00:49:12,620 --> 00:49:15,450
Well... I... all's good...

930
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:26,250
I mean... I am trying Honey.

931
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:28,210
Trying.

932
00:49:28,290 --> 00:49:29,950
I am trying really hard.

933
00:49:30,290 --> 00:49:32,830
Raj, you're still trying?

934
00:49:33,750 --> 00:49:34,870
What do you mean you're trying?

935
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:37,830
Look... you're done trying.

936
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:41,290
You know, let's do one thing.

937
00:49:41,540 --> 00:49:44,200
Let's pack our bags and
go back to your Chandni Chowk.

938
00:49:44,790 --> 00:49:46,000
Trying.

939
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:49,250
Don't talk to me like that.

940
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:53,500
Sir... Chotu from the shop is here.

941
00:49:56,250 --> 00:49:57,910
What do you want me to do?
Welcome him?

942
00:49:58,250 --> 00:49:59,200
Send him in.

943
00:49:59,620 --> 00:50:00,580
Yes.

944
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:03,660
Go on.

945
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:07,370
Calm down...

946
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:12,250
- Hello, madam. Hello, sir.
- Yeah.

947
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:13,830
You didn't come to the shop, so...

948
00:50:13,950 --> 00:50:15,450
I thought I'll come over
personally and offer the sweets.

949
00:50:16,370 --> 00:50:18,120
Looks like he's had another child.

950
00:50:18,370 --> 00:50:20,200
How many kids are
you going to have, Chotu?

951
00:50:21,750 --> 00:50:25,290
No-no... my daughter got admission
in an English Medium school.

952
00:50:25,790 --> 00:50:26,950
- Wow, Chotu.
- Yes.

953
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:28,580
- That's good news.
- Yes.

954
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:30,250
Which school?

955
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:32,040
Parkriti School.

956
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:42,410
Which Prakriti is this?

957
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,790
There's just one Parkriti.

958
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:47,250
- Prakriti School.
- Yes, that...

959
00:50:47,410 --> 00:50:51,200
- How did she get the admission?
- All thanks to sir.

960
00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:53,370
- Sir?
- Thanks to sir?

961
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:55,450
Who?
What did I do?

962
00:50:55,620 --> 00:50:57,160
- All thanks to him?
- But I didn't do anything.

963
00:50:57,250 --> 00:50:59,000
- He's lying.
- Because of me.

964
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:00,330
It is because of him.

965
00:51:00,410 --> 00:51:02,330
Sir sent me to collect the form.

966
00:51:02,410 --> 00:51:03,910
So, there was a queue for
the underprivileged as well.

967
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:05,950
I got in that line too,
and got a form.

968
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:09,620
Well... it's all about luck.

969
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:10,910
With God's grace...

970
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,620
soon Pia and Rani
will study together.

971
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,620
Really... you do have God's blessings.

972
00:51:20,750 --> 00:51:22,290
Yes, of course.

973
00:51:24,290 --> 00:51:26,370
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

974
00:51:26,870 --> 00:51:27,870
Have a sweet.

975
00:51:37,330 --> 00:51:38,700
Go back to the shop,
I'll see you there.

976
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,120
- Huh?
- Go back to the shop.

977
00:51:40,250 --> 00:51:41,080
Should I leave?

978
00:51:55,370 --> 00:51:56,370
I am trying.

979
00:51:56,580 --> 00:51:57,830
Mitho...

980
00:52:01,950 --> 00:52:03,370
She's angry.

981
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:07,000
I am in big trouble now.

982
00:52:13,330 --> 00:52:15,450
Let's try the sweets.

983
00:52:20,330 --> 00:52:21,750
Eat the sweet.

984
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:23,830
At least you helped someone out.

985
00:52:36,750 --> 00:52:39,000
So 10 o'clock is a basic math class.

986
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:39,750
Okay.

987
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
Twelve o'clock is swimming at the club.

988
00:52:42,290 --> 00:52:44,500
And then at 2 English class.

989
00:52:44,660 --> 00:52:47,080
- So madam, what now?
- What?

990
00:52:47,250 --> 00:52:48,500
I would like to have a word with you.

991
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:50,450
What can I do for you, Mr. Batra?

992
00:52:50,660 --> 00:52:52,200
Open a new school for your kid?

993
00:52:52,290 --> 00:52:54,080
You can't because you
have opened a shop.

994
00:52:54,290 --> 00:52:54,870
What?

995
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:56,750
You're running a business here.

996
00:52:58,040 --> 00:53:02,200
Excuse me Mr. and Mrs. Sharma,
I'll be back.

997
00:53:03,250 --> 00:53:04,080
Thank you.

998
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:06,910
Yes...

999
00:53:07,950 --> 00:53:10,410
- Can't you speak softly?
- How can I speak softly?

1000
00:53:10,540 --> 00:53:12,250
We've been having sleepless nights.

1001
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:14,450
Why?

1002
00:53:14,580 --> 00:53:16,080
The child of my salesman
got the admission...

1003
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:18,370
Please, keep your volume down.

1004
00:53:18,790 --> 00:53:20,960
His child got the admission
in the same school...

1005
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:22,540
where we've been
trying for so long.

1006
00:53:22,660 --> 00:53:24,120
- Must be through RTE.
- Huh?

1007
00:53:24,370 --> 00:53:26,200
- Right To Education.
- What is that?

1008
00:53:26,290 --> 00:53:27,410
What do we do with it?

1009
00:53:27,830 --> 00:53:32,200
Every school needs to keep 25 percent
reservation... for the poor kids.

1010
00:53:32,370 --> 00:53:33,370
- So?
- Understand?

1011
00:53:33,540 --> 00:53:35,040
According to the rules,
that's their right.

1012
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:36,410
Don't we have any rights?

1013
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:39,620
Keep it down... down, Mr. Batra.

1014
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:43,250
Don't we deserve a good
education for our child?

1015
00:53:43,750 --> 00:53:45,370
There is one option...

1016
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:47,700
but I don't think
you can go that far.

1017
00:53:47,790 --> 00:53:50,370
- Just tell me...
- Fill the form...

1018
00:53:51,750 --> 00:53:52,700
through RTE.

1019
00:53:52,870 --> 00:53:54,290
Simple. Okay.

1020
00:53:54,370 --> 00:53:56,870
But... that's for the poor kids.

1021
00:53:57,040 --> 00:54:02,330
How can poor kids cope up
in big schools like this?

1022
00:54:02,540 --> 00:54:04,660
How can they adjust
in such an environment?

1023
00:54:04,910 --> 00:54:05,870
Think?

1024
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:11,330
Even if they get admission,
they will bail out in a year or two.

1025
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:15,120
Instead of the seat getting wasted,
you could get it.

1026
00:54:15,250 --> 00:54:17,040
I mean I am just suggesting.

1027
00:54:17,250 --> 00:54:20,080
- But... one has to be poor for that.
- No...

1028
00:54:21,410 --> 00:54:22,950
You don't have to be poor...

1029
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:24,790
but you need documents
to show you're poor.

1030
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:28,750
The seat's available,
and your kid needs admission.

1031
00:54:29,580 --> 00:54:31,950
Are you asking me
to make fake documents?

1032
00:54:33,830 --> 00:54:34,950
What's the harm in it?

1033
00:54:35,580 --> 00:54:36,410
School admission is fine...

1034
00:54:36,540 --> 00:54:38,200
but I don't want to
land up in jail, madam.

1035
00:54:40,410 --> 00:54:42,580
You're Chandni Chowk's
business tycoon.

1036
00:54:43,330 --> 00:54:45,330
- Aren't you?
- Yes, I am.

1037
00:54:45,580 --> 00:54:47,000
Then you must know...

1038
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:49,200
People don't go to jail
even after scams worth millions.

1039
00:54:49,330 --> 00:54:51,500
So why would you?

1040
00:54:52,750 --> 00:54:55,750
Anyway, I knew you couldn't do it.

1041
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:57,700
But lovely seeing you.

1042
00:54:59,830 --> 00:55:02,290
My maid's daughter
want admission, so...

1043
00:55:02,540 --> 00:55:05,120
what documents will she require to
apply under the underprivileged quota?

1044
00:55:05,830 --> 00:55:07,960
Aadhar card, Ration Card, BPL card.

1045
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:10,750
Income proof,
resident proof, and child proof.

1046
00:55:10,950 --> 00:55:13,330
And yes, it will take three weeks.

1047
00:55:13,580 --> 00:55:15,080
So many documents and so much time.

1048
00:55:15,410 --> 00:55:18,500
It's not an easy job.
This is official work.

1049
00:55:18,830 --> 00:55:19,950
Keep moving.

1050
00:55:20,950 --> 00:55:21,540
Next.

1051
00:55:21,750 --> 00:55:22,580
Yes, what do you want.

1052
00:55:22,790 --> 00:55:26,040
Tea-tea-tea-tea...
Tea, mister.

1053
00:55:26,250 --> 00:55:27,580
I Don't want your tea.

1054
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:30,200
But do you want admission?

1055
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:31,330
Gulp it down.

1056
00:55:31,410 --> 00:55:32,410
Admission.

1057
00:55:32,950 --> 00:55:34,200
Pay at the teashop.

1058
00:55:40,330 --> 00:55:41,580
Consider it done, sir.

1059
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:43,950
Everyone keeps assuring me...
But how will you do it?

1060
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:46,160
Just pay me an advance..

1061
00:55:46,410 --> 00:55:48,410
And I'll get all the signatures.

1062
00:55:48,580 --> 00:55:51,790
Along with all the legal stamps.

1063
00:55:51,910 --> 00:55:53,120
You might get me the documents...

1064
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:55,580
but how will the
school believe it's real?

1065
00:55:56,370 --> 00:56:00,040
Sir, I've setting with
everyone in there who drinks my tea.

1066
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:04,040
From government officials,
to businessmen to middlemen like me.

1067
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:06,910
This cup of tea is what
binds the entire country together.

1068
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:08,750
I beg you...

1069
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:13,160
Will my daughter get admission
in Delhi Grammar School?

1070
00:56:13,580 --> 00:56:15,910
Sir... consider it done.

1071
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:19,040
You see, there's just one thing
left to do after submitting the file.

1072
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:20,410
Lottery.

1073
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:22,000
Lottery.

1074
00:56:22,330 --> 00:56:24,870
All the admissions under
RTE are selected through lottery.

1075
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:28,290
The names of kids expecting
admission are written on a chit.

1076
00:56:28,450 --> 00:56:31,870
We'll write the name of
your child on one such chit.

1077
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,000
And let it cool with
our chilled bottle of water.

1078
00:56:35,250 --> 00:56:40,120
Amidst all the rife for admission,
the chit attached to the cold bottle...

1079
00:56:40,250 --> 00:56:42,410
will be delivered to our guy.

1080
00:56:42,660 --> 00:56:46,080
And he will put that
chit in the lottery bowl.

1081
00:56:47,620 --> 00:56:51,040
When the drawee gets
his hands on this cold chit...

1082
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:53,790
it will be the one with
your child's name on it.

1083
00:56:53,870 --> 00:56:55,000
Pia Batra.

1084
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,700
What are you saying, sir?
Just tell me your name.

1085
00:57:00,580 --> 00:57:02,330
Raj Batra.

1086
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:05,500
Yearly income, 150,000.

1087
00:57:06,410 --> 00:57:09,660
Address; 15/64 Bharat Nagar.

1088
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,580
Sir... consider it done.

1089
00:57:11,750 --> 00:57:14,080
Yes, definitely.
Go give the good news to your wife.

1090
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,700
Oh Raj, thank you so much.

1091
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:21,580
Thank you so much.

1092
00:57:21,790 --> 00:57:23,790
Let's go out, celebrate.

1093
00:57:23,910 --> 00:57:26,660
I'll make you... really happy.

1094
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:31,370
You've already made me really happy.

1095
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:34,120
Now... it's my turn.

1096
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:36,750
- Really?
- I'll be right back.

1097
00:57:36,910 --> 00:57:37,830
Okay.

1098
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:41,000
Hurry up.

1099
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:47,080
God...

1100
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,000
No.

1101
00:58:04,450 --> 00:58:05,620
No.

1102
00:58:05,910 --> 00:58:08,870
Poverty and misery don't form
an obstruction in the way of talent...

1103
00:58:08,950 --> 00:58:13,700
that's why 25% seats
are reserved in public schools.

1104
00:58:13,790 --> 00:58:17,830
But the rich brats
hog these seats as well.

1105
00:58:17,950 --> 00:58:20,120
Let's watch a report
by our correspondent.

1106
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:22,540
Delhi's private schools exposed.

1107
00:58:22,750 --> 00:58:24,290
The rich are pretending to be poor...

1108
00:58:24,370 --> 00:58:26,830
in order to get their children
admission in elite schools.

1109
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,370
What would you like to say about it?

1110
00:58:28,450 --> 00:58:29,830
I've said this before...

1111
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:34,370
all the accusations against
us are wrong and baseless.

1112
00:58:34,450 --> 00:58:37,330
But ma'am,
our investigation has revealed...

1113
00:58:37,410 --> 00:58:39,700
that many parents have
submitted fake documents...

1114
00:58:39,830 --> 00:58:43,290
in order to get their
children admitted in your school.

1115
00:58:43,790 --> 00:58:45,580
All this was going
on right under your nose...

1116
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:47,370
and you didn't even had a clue.

1117
00:58:47,870 --> 00:58:49,750
Let me tell you something?

1118
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:52,910
My mother was a
poor servant in this school.

1119
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:56,620
You can't imagine
the things I've endured.

1120
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,910
But once I got a chance
to get into this school...

1121
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:02,040
it changed my life.

1122
00:59:02,830 --> 00:59:03,830
Do you really think...

1123
00:59:03,910 --> 00:59:06,250
I can take this opportunity
away from some poor kid?

1124
00:59:06,410 --> 00:59:09,200
Honestly, such deeds are
a real embarrassment to humanity.

1125
00:59:09,290 --> 00:59:09,870
Sweetheart.

1126
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,040
What steps will you take...

1127
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:13,120
- to prevent this fraud in your school?
- Raj.

1128
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:16,790
I will personally supervise
the entire admission process.

1129
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:19,660
We'll strictly monitor
every application...

1130
00:59:19,750 --> 00:59:21,910
that we get through RTE.

1131
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:27,620
Our teachers will
personally make home visits.

1132
00:59:27,950 --> 00:59:31,950
And any defaulter
will be behind bars.

1133
00:59:32,250 --> 00:59:33,370
That's my promise.

1134
00:59:33,620 --> 00:59:36,370
We hope that Principle Singhania
will stay true to her promise.

1135
00:59:36,620 --> 00:59:37,830
Now let's watch...

1136
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:48,580
How can you be so foolish, Raj?

1137
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:54,040
I did it for you... I couldn't
see you tense anymore.

1138
00:59:54,410 --> 00:59:56,960
I met a number of
people... tried to give donation...

1139
00:59:57,040 --> 00:59:58,580
even tried to use influence.

1140
00:59:58,790 --> 01:00:00,790
What else could I do?

1141
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:04,040
Get all the documents back, please.

1142
01:00:04,540 --> 01:00:05,910
Get them back?

1143
01:00:06,540 --> 01:00:08,790
They are already submitted,
we can't get them back.

1144
01:00:14,830 --> 01:00:16,870
You got us in a really
big mess this time, Raj.

1145
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:19,950
Have you ever imagined what will happen
to Pia and me if you get jailed?

1146
01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:22,830
If Pia asks me where's Papa,
what am I going to tell her.

1147
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:23,870
'Tihar Jail.'

1148
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:26,660
And what if she can't endure all this?
Then what will I do?

1149
01:00:26,830 --> 01:00:29,250
What if she gets depressed
and starts doing drugs?

1150
01:00:29,330 --> 01:00:31,950
For God's sake please slow down.

1151
01:00:32,290 --> 01:00:34,700
Raj... you cannot get arrested.

1152
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:37,950
Think, there must be some way. Think.

1153
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:39,750
There's nothing we can do now.

1154
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,160
We can't become poor.

1155
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:52,540
So let's become poor.

1156
01:00:53,410 --> 01:00:54,410
You said there won't be any problems.

1157
01:00:54,580 --> 01:00:56,000
You said that I should give
this good news to my wife.

1158
01:00:56,120 --> 01:00:57,040
Now she's yelling at me.

1159
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:58,620
It's a fine mess you got me into.

1160
01:00:58,750 --> 01:01:01,750
Sir, this has never happened
in the last 7 years of my career.

1161
01:01:01,830 --> 01:01:05,580
You know,
the entire Delhi Police is after me.

1162
01:01:05,700 --> 01:01:07,830
Do you know who's after me?
My wife.

1163
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:09,870
She's saying let's become poor.

1164
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:10,950
How can I become poor?

1165
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:12,580
What an idea, sir?

1166
01:01:12,700 --> 01:01:15,080
I'll get you a room
in Bharat Nagar for a month.

1167
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:17,250
- Yeah...
- Not you too.

1168
01:01:17,790 --> 01:01:22,960
Three for 100... 3 for 100... 3
for 100... 3 for 100.

1169
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:24,660
Do you have anything cheaper?

1170
01:01:24,790 --> 01:01:27,410
This one's cheaper...
Three for 50... 3 for 50... 3 for 50...

1171
01:01:27,540 --> 01:01:28,910
Do you have anything still cheaper?

1172
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:31,040
Madam, what can be
cheaper than 50 rupees.

1173
01:01:40,750 --> 01:01:42,700
I should feel poor from inside too.

1174
01:01:51,790 --> 01:01:55,000
You know... we're going to
Europe for a month's vacation.

1175
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:59,000
- Where in Europe?
- We'll go to Paris first.

1176
01:01:59,080 --> 01:02:00,620
Paris for a month?

1177
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:02,250
No, we'll head to France from there.

1178
01:02:04,830 --> 01:02:06,410
You're too much, Raj.
He's joking.

1179
01:02:07,330 --> 01:02:09,370
From Paris we'll
go straight to London.

1180
01:02:09,620 --> 01:02:12,790
- You must go to Nobu.
- Where? Where?

1181
01:02:12,910 --> 01:02:14,580
Of course, Nobu's on our list too.

1182
01:02:14,660 --> 01:02:16,830
- Nobu.
- Of course, it's just wonderful.

1183
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:18,870
We'll go there directly
as soon as we land.

1184
01:02:23,080 --> 01:02:25,000
- You guys are going to France?
- Yeah...

1185
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:26,040
Yes...

1186
01:02:26,410 --> 01:02:28,540
- Don't forget to go to Nice.
- Where?

1187
01:02:28,660 --> 01:02:30,450
Their beaches are very beautiful.

1188
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:31,580
I see...

1189
01:02:31,660 --> 01:02:33,120
- We'll go there too.
- Yes.

1190
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:35,200
We'll cover the beach
as soon as we land.

1191
01:02:35,830 --> 01:02:38,950
And yes, don't forget
to post photos on Facebook.

1192
01:02:39,620 --> 01:02:41,370
- Photos?
- We'll post photos.

1193
01:02:41,830 --> 01:02:43,660
- Photos.
- We'll post photos as soon as we land.

1194
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:50,080
Smile, please.

1195
01:02:50,580 --> 01:02:51,450
Very good.

1196
01:02:51,620 --> 01:02:53,080
Look here, child.

1197
01:02:54,330 --> 01:02:56,540
One more. Here...

1198
01:02:56,750 --> 01:02:58,620
Chin up.

1199
01:02:58,830 --> 01:03:00,700
Look here.

1200
01:03:00,910 --> 01:03:02,250
Bend a little more.

1201
01:03:04,250 --> 01:03:05,660
Very good.

1202
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:07,660
Back up a little.

1203
01:03:07,870 --> 01:03:10,000
Come a little closer.
Look here.

1204
01:03:21,080 --> 01:03:23,160
Hurry up, quickly..

1205
01:03:23,660 --> 01:03:24,910
Get in.

1206
01:03:25,830 --> 01:03:26,830
Come on.

1207
01:03:27,580 --> 01:03:28,330
Come on.

1208
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:29,750
Sit.

1209
01:03:30,080 --> 01:03:31,830
What are we doing?

1210
01:03:32,250 --> 01:03:33,000
Mita...

1211
01:03:35,580 --> 01:03:36,830
Mita think about it again.

1212
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:45,910
Driver, take us to Bharat Nagar.

1213
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:50,660
Remember we took you to a
jungle safari during your holidays.

1214
01:03:50,870 --> 01:03:54,830
Yes, I remember.
But we didn't see the tiger.

1215
01:03:54,910 --> 01:03:55,580
We didn't.

1216
01:03:55,660 --> 01:03:59,950
But you said I must tell
everyone that we saw the tiger.

1217
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:01,950
Are we going there, papa?

1218
01:04:02,080 --> 01:04:03,290
We're not going there, dear.

1219
01:04:03,410 --> 01:04:04,580
And you won't get to
see the tiger this time.

1220
01:04:04,700 --> 01:04:06,040
Nor will you see the elephant.
You will see dogs,

1221
01:04:06,120 --> 01:04:07,540
cats, lots of people, sewers, garbage.

1222
01:04:15,660 --> 01:04:17,450
Come, Pia.

1223
01:04:20,580 --> 01:04:22,830
Raj, it's stinking.

1224
01:04:23,330 --> 01:04:25,580
Smells like we're standing
next to the gutter.

1225
01:04:25,660 --> 01:04:27,620
Actually,
we're standing in the gutter.

1226
01:04:27,700 --> 01:04:28,700
Come this way.

1227
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:31,250
What happened?

1228
01:04:31,540 --> 01:04:33,540
This is too much.

1229
01:04:33,870 --> 01:04:35,410
Don't yell darling...

1230
01:04:35,540 --> 01:04:37,200
or everyone will
know who we actually are.

1231
01:04:37,290 --> 01:04:39,160
- Careful, dear... watch your step.
- Mister.

1232
01:04:39,250 --> 01:04:40,370
This way?

1233
01:04:40,540 --> 01:04:42,330
You can unload
the luggage right here.

1234
01:04:42,540 --> 01:04:44,120
Let me check first.

1235
01:04:46,290 --> 01:04:47,620
I'll ask someone, wait.

1236
01:04:47,830 --> 01:04:48,660
5/...

1237
01:04:48,750 --> 01:04:49,580
I had saved the address.

1238
01:04:49,750 --> 01:04:51,870
- Raj, just ask someone.
- 5/... what?

1239
01:04:52,040 --> 01:04:53,290
Don't you remember?

1240
01:04:53,410 --> 01:04:55,370
Excuse me, mister... where is...

1241
01:04:55,950 --> 01:04:58,370
- Are you new here?
- No, wait...

1242
01:04:58,500 --> 01:05:00,330
Hello, sister-in-law.

1243
01:05:00,500 --> 01:05:02,910
- Hello.
- Who are you visiting?

1244
01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:06,040
- Give it here...
- No-no... I can carry it.

1245
01:05:06,120 --> 01:05:07,330
Let it go...

1246
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:09,500
What are you doing, mister?

1247
01:05:09,750 --> 01:05:12,000
Aren't you Mr. Prasad's nephew?

1248
01:05:12,120 --> 01:05:13,500
- Prasad who?
- You've lost your mind?

1249
01:05:13,620 --> 01:05:16,500
He died of cholera.
Give me your luggage.

1250
01:05:16,750 --> 01:05:18,370
- I'll carry these.
- Mister...

1251
01:05:18,540 --> 01:05:21,250
No-no-no... he looks like
brother Badri... with big eyes.

1252
01:05:21,370 --> 01:05:23,120
Yeah... one who died of TB.

1253
01:05:23,330 --> 01:05:25,080
Who died of what?

1254
01:05:25,410 --> 01:05:26,750
Shut up all of you.

1255
01:05:27,830 --> 01:05:29,250
Here child, have some sweets.

1256
01:05:29,450 --> 01:05:30,620
You can take as much as you want.

1257
01:05:31,290 --> 01:05:32,580
Don't touch. Don't touch.

1258
01:05:32,660 --> 01:05:34,500
- Don't...
- English?

1259
01:05:34,660 --> 01:05:36,790
No-no-no English... that's
all she knows.

1260
01:05:36,910 --> 01:05:38,790
She doesn't like jaundice,
uh yellow...

1261
01:05:38,870 --> 01:05:39,870
I mean she doesn't
like yellow sweets.

1262
01:05:40,040 --> 01:05:41,620
I see... I see...

1263
01:05:41,910 --> 01:05:43,290
Keep the luggage
down... keep it down.

1264
01:05:43,410 --> 01:05:44,040
Hey, mister...

1265
01:05:44,120 --> 01:05:45,750
- We'll carry it.
- Keep it down.

1266
01:05:45,830 --> 01:05:48,450
We're trying to be helpful,
and you're being rude to us.

1267
01:05:48,540 --> 01:05:50,080
No-no, I am just asking...

1268
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:53,450
Listen, don't ever
call us for help now.

1269
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:56,700
Even if you get chikungunya,
tuberculosis, dengue we won't come.

1270
01:05:56,870 --> 01:05:59,120
- Why will I get any of those?
- Yes, we won't come.

1271
01:05:59,330 --> 01:06:02,660
Let's go! We won't come
to help even if you call us now.

1272
01:06:02,750 --> 01:06:04,830
Have some sherbet,
it'll cool you down.

1273
01:06:05,120 --> 01:06:06,660
Wait-wait-wait...

1274
01:06:06,910 --> 01:06:09,750
- 5/64... where is it?
- There it is.

1275
01:06:13,250 --> 01:06:15,120
I've been trying
to tell you for so long.

1276
01:06:15,450 --> 01:06:16,950
I will definitely not help them.

1277
01:06:17,700 --> 01:06:18,450
Come here.

1278
01:06:18,870 --> 01:06:23,160
Mr. Kumar, you should've come to
me instead of going to the press.

1279
01:06:23,540 --> 01:06:25,620
How did you know, ma'am?

1280
01:06:26,080 --> 01:06:27,290
That's not important.

1281
01:06:27,500 --> 01:06:30,290
What's important is,
by going to the press...

1282
01:06:30,370 --> 01:06:33,660
you've damaged the reputation
of Delhi Grammar School.

1283
01:06:33,870 --> 01:06:35,660
That was not my intention, ma'am.

1284
01:06:36,790 --> 01:06:39,500
Actually... there's been
a lot going on in the school...

1285
01:06:39,660 --> 01:06:41,500
regarding the
admission of poor kids.

1286
01:06:44,250 --> 01:06:46,410
And I believed that maybe...

1287
01:06:46,540 --> 01:06:50,540
you wouldn't even want
to hear me out on this topic.

1288
01:06:51,540 --> 01:06:54,040
You doubt me, Mr. Kumar?

1289
01:06:54,410 --> 01:06:55,500
No, Ma'am.

1290
01:07:01,080 --> 01:07:02,040
What's this, ma'am?

1291
01:07:02,290 --> 01:07:05,370
This is a list of people
who applied under RTE.

1292
01:07:05,910 --> 01:07:08,830
Since you discovered this scam...

1293
01:07:09,160 --> 01:07:12,450
I would want you to
finish your investigation.

1294
01:07:12,790 --> 01:07:17,120
Your duty is to visit every
family personally and conduct checks.

1295
01:07:19,660 --> 01:07:20,660
Me?

1296
01:07:21,160 --> 01:07:23,910
I am just a Hindi teacher, ma'am.
How can I do this?

1297
01:07:24,620 --> 01:07:27,250
Mr. Kumar, you want to
change the system, don't you?

1298
01:07:27,500 --> 01:07:29,620
I am giving you this
opportunity today.

1299
01:07:30,700 --> 01:07:31,870
You can go.

1300
01:07:39,120 --> 01:07:41,290
Raj, the condition
of this house is pathetic.

1301
01:07:41,580 --> 01:07:42,370
I see...

1302
01:07:42,540 --> 01:07:44,870
But we are doing
it for your happiness.

1303
01:07:45,540 --> 01:07:47,250
I am happy if you're happy.

1304
01:07:55,910 --> 01:07:58,500
How can we both fit
on this small mattress?

1305
01:08:02,330 --> 01:08:05,250
This half is yours,
and this half is mine.

1306
01:08:07,330 --> 01:08:09,830
You know,
this makes me realize that...

1307
01:08:10,040 --> 01:08:13,410
in a poor man's life,
helplessness often leads to romance.

1308
01:08:13,620 --> 01:08:15,120
You got us in this trouble...

1309
01:08:15,250 --> 01:08:16,500
now don't tell me
about your helplessness.

1310
01:08:16,700 --> 01:08:17,790
I got us in this trouble?!

1311
01:08:19,870 --> 01:08:22,660
- You're blaming me?
- Can you spell 'blame'?

1312
01:08:23,500 --> 01:08:24,870
Can you spell 'shame'?

1313
01:08:25,950 --> 01:08:27,330
Let me sleep.

1314
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:31,370
- Come-come-come.
- Please don't, Raj.

1315
01:08:31,830 --> 01:08:33,330
Let me sleep.

1316
01:08:33,950 --> 01:08:35,580
This is a fine mess we're in.

1317
01:08:37,700 --> 01:08:39,080
Where do I keep my hand?

1318
01:08:42,290 --> 01:08:45,410
- What are you doing, Raj?
- Trying, what else?

1319
01:08:45,540 --> 01:08:48,660
- Let me sleep.
- That's what I'm doing-trying to sleep.

1320
01:08:49,660 --> 01:08:51,910
Will rubbing your hairy
leg against mine make you fall asleep?

1321
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:54,410
My hairy legs are
nowhere near your legs.

1322
01:08:58,160 --> 01:08:58,910
Raj!

1323
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:01,790
Raj, wake up... it's a rat!
Under that!

1324
01:09:01,950 --> 01:09:03,580
- That way...
- Where?

1325
01:09:03,660 --> 01:09:05,830
Stop looking there... it's
here... it's a big rat!

1326
01:09:06,120 --> 01:09:07,620
- Here... get it out!
- Where?

1327
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:09,790
Where is it?
Where is it?

1328
01:09:10,040 --> 01:09:10,790
Raj, there...

1329
01:09:10,950 --> 01:09:12,700
Right-right-right... left-left-left...

1330
01:09:12,790 --> 01:09:14,040
I am checking.

1331
01:09:14,660 --> 01:09:16,620
It won't come out
the same way it went in.

1332
01:09:16,700 --> 01:09:18,660
Oh Raj, you can't kill a rat!
What are you doing?

1333
01:09:18,750 --> 01:09:20,580
I'll kill it if I see it.

1334
01:09:21,500 --> 01:09:22,500
What are you doing?
You can't kill it with that!

1335
01:09:22,580 --> 01:09:23,830
That's for killing mosquitoes.

1336
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:24,750
Where is it?

1337
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:29,040
Papa, Jerry.
I also want to see... please, papa.

1338
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:31,200
Yes, dear. It's Jerry.

1339
01:09:31,450 --> 01:09:32,700
Here... there it goes.

1340
01:09:32,790 --> 01:09:34,000
Where?

1341
01:09:35,620 --> 01:09:36,290
Where is it?

1342
01:09:38,160 --> 01:09:38,790
That way...

1343
01:09:39,370 --> 01:09:40,750
There it is.

1344
01:09:50,830 --> 01:09:52,500
Mita. Mita.

1345
01:09:52,870 --> 01:09:54,160
Just a minute, Raj.

1346
01:09:54,290 --> 01:09:55,040
Mita.

1347
01:09:55,290 --> 01:09:57,660
I'm uploading our
Paris photos on Facebook.

1348
01:09:57,950 --> 01:09:59,500
I am stuck with my download... and
you're busy uploading.

1349
01:09:59,580 --> 01:10:00,830
There's no water here.

1350
01:10:00,950 --> 01:10:02,290
Mita. Mita.

1351
01:10:02,540 --> 01:10:05,700
- Get me some water.
- Fine, just a minute.

1352
01:10:05,790 --> 01:10:07,120
I'll get some from the kitchen.

1353
01:10:08,200 --> 01:10:09,580
It's too much...

1354
01:10:09,870 --> 01:10:12,370
- How much do you want?
- What kind of a question is that?

1355
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:13,950
Give me whatever there is.

1356
01:10:16,700 --> 01:10:19,500
Raj, there's no water anywhere.

1357
01:10:19,580 --> 01:10:21,700
What do I do?
Get some water from somewhere.

1358
01:10:21,830 --> 01:10:23,040
Do something.

1359
01:10:37,410 --> 01:10:41,040
- Yes, what is it?
- My husband's stuck in the toilet.

1360
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:44,040
- I want some water.
- We don't have enough for ourselves.

1361
01:10:44,120 --> 01:10:45,750
How can we give you?
Get lost.

1362
01:10:45,830 --> 01:10:47,870
- That's not the way.
- Go away...

1363
01:10:52,620 --> 01:10:54,620
Sister, I want some water.
My husband's stuck in the toilet.

1364
01:10:54,830 --> 01:10:55,580
I see...

1365
01:10:55,830 --> 01:10:57,700
Yesterday you wouldn't
touch our sweets.

1366
01:10:57,910 --> 01:10:59,830
What if our water infects you?

1367
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:02,500
Don't you dare touch our water.

1368
01:11:02,950 --> 01:11:05,000
- Listen, can I get some water...
- There's no water here.

1369
01:11:05,370 --> 01:11:06,830
Where do I get water now?

1370
01:11:07,620 --> 01:11:11,120
I guess you'll have
to use newspaper, Raj.

1371
01:11:19,500 --> 01:11:20,750
Here's some water, sister.

1372
01:11:21,160 --> 01:11:23,620
You people should die of shame.

1373
01:11:24,250 --> 01:11:26,160
You can't even spare
a bucket of water.

1374
01:11:26,910 --> 01:11:28,660
Is this how you welcome
new people around here?

1375
01:11:29,950 --> 01:11:32,040
Here sister, help your husband out.

1376
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:34,080
God bless you.

1377
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:36,250
- Nonsense...
- Thank you...

1378
01:11:36,370 --> 01:11:38,450
And you guys claim that
this was once a prosperous place.

1379
01:11:39,500 --> 01:11:40,950
- Raj, water...
- Give it. Give it.

1380
01:11:41,080 --> 01:11:42,370
Open the door.

1381
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:44,080
Give it.

1382
01:11:44,160 --> 01:11:45,200
Give me your hand.

1383
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:50,250
Mister, you really saved me today.

1384
01:11:50,540 --> 01:11:52,700
I just realized the value of water.

1385
01:11:52,790 --> 01:11:54,790
No-no... it's nothing.

1386
01:11:55,120 --> 01:11:56,910
- What's your name?
- Mine?

1387
01:11:57,540 --> 01:12:01,450
Only people with class have a name.

1388
01:12:01,540 --> 01:12:02,870
If you work in a restaurant,
they call you 'waiter'.

1389
01:12:02,950 --> 01:12:04,500
If you have a paunch,
they call you 'Fatty'.

1390
01:12:04,620 --> 01:12:05,700
If you are tall,
they call you 'Lanky'.

1391
01:12:05,950 --> 01:12:07,330
If you carry luggage...
they call you a 'Porter'.

1392
01:12:07,540 --> 01:12:10,040
If you tend to a garden, they call you a
'Gardener' or they just swear at you.

1393
01:12:10,370 --> 01:12:12,830
And the rest call me
whatever they feel like.

1394
01:12:13,160 --> 01:12:14,950
Surely your parents gave you a name.

1395
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:17,500
Yes,
my parents named me Shyamprakash.

1396
01:12:17,660 --> 01:12:19,620
But no one's called me by that name.

1397
01:12:22,540 --> 01:12:25,950
Brother... thank you very much.

1398
01:12:28,290 --> 01:12:30,500
If you ever need anything,
then call me.

1399
01:12:30,790 --> 01:12:33,410
Listen... why next time...
I'll tell you right now.

1400
01:12:33,660 --> 01:12:35,160
That's my wife Tulsi...

1401
01:12:35,290 --> 01:12:36,120
- Hello.
- Hello.

1402
01:12:36,290 --> 01:12:37,660
And that's my son Mohan.

1403
01:12:38,660 --> 01:12:43,830
You see... we've filled the
form for Delhi Grammar School.

1404
01:12:44,370 --> 01:12:45,370
Delhi Grammar School?

1405
01:12:45,500 --> 01:12:46,500
Yes. Why?

1406
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:50,910
Even we filled a form with them.

1407
01:12:51,450 --> 01:12:52,450
- You too?!
- Yes.

1408
01:12:52,910 --> 01:12:54,500
This is great.

1409
01:12:54,750 --> 01:12:57,660
Listen... it's like this...

1410
01:12:57,750 --> 01:13:01,660
Sister-in-law, the other
day you two were talking in English.

1411
01:13:01,870 --> 01:13:04,160
I want my son to learn that.

1412
01:13:05,450 --> 01:13:08,330
No-no-no she doesn't know English.
She just pretends...

1413
01:13:08,410 --> 01:13:11,290
Hello, I know English very well.
Do you know?

1414
01:13:11,450 --> 01:13:14,370
Wow... she speaks so fluently.

1415
01:13:14,540 --> 01:13:16,540
That's exactly what
I want you to teach him.

1416
01:13:16,620 --> 01:13:18,700
I'll send him from tomorrow,
sister-in-law.

1417
01:13:19,080 --> 01:13:22,080
- Don't just stand there, go make some tea.
- Yeah.

1418
01:13:22,870 --> 01:13:24,410
Son, make friends.

1419
01:13:24,750 --> 01:13:25,580
I love you.

1420
01:13:25,910 --> 01:13:27,910
Now I got to teach him English.

1421
01:13:29,370 --> 01:13:31,450
You didn't have to
show off your talent.

1422
01:13:31,830 --> 01:13:32,580
I am trying to give you a hint...

1423
01:13:32,660 --> 01:13:34,620
Would it be insulting
for you to just take a hint?

1424
01:13:34,790 --> 01:13:36,200
Can you spell 'insult'.

1425
01:13:36,540 --> 01:13:39,200
If we get caught, they will teach us
the meaning along with the spelling...

1426
01:13:39,500 --> 01:13:40,790
by clobbering
us with their shoes.

1427
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:42,500
We've left home,
we'll have to leave city too.

1428
01:13:42,620 --> 01:13:44,000
Speak softly Raj.

1429
01:13:44,830 --> 01:13:46,370
Oh, God.

1430
01:13:46,700 --> 01:13:48,500
Papa, dengue.

1431
01:13:48,620 --> 01:13:49,080
What son?

1432
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:50,120
- What happened?
- Where is it?

1433
01:13:50,330 --> 01:13:51,870
- Where is it?
- There it is.

1434
01:13:51,950 --> 01:13:53,620
- Who's where?
- There. There.

1435
01:13:54,580 --> 01:13:55,790
Where?

1436
01:13:56,120 --> 01:13:57,950
- What is it?
- There it is.

1437
01:13:59,410 --> 01:14:00,330
What is it?

1438
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:01,950
What is it?

1439
01:14:02,200 --> 01:14:03,910
See... this is dengue.

1440
01:14:04,040 --> 01:14:04,830
Chikungunya.

1441
01:14:04,910 --> 01:14:06,910
They are they reason why
all the hospitals in Delhi are full.

1442
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:08,580
Why are you bringing it here?
Take it away.

1443
01:14:10,500 --> 01:14:11,830
- There must be more around.
- No.

1444
01:14:11,910 --> 01:14:13,500
- Let's go...
- Wait... let me show you a trick.

1445
01:14:16,540 --> 01:14:17,750
What are you doing?

1446
01:14:17,950 --> 01:14:23,000
You see... the male mosquito thinks
that the female is calling him.

1447
01:14:23,870 --> 01:14:25,370
Don't call it here!

1448
01:14:34,870 --> 01:14:36,160
Open the door.

1449
01:14:37,410 --> 01:14:38,870
It's right here.
Come on.

1450
01:14:38,950 --> 01:14:41,200
What happened?

1451
01:14:41,330 --> 01:14:42,160
Look who's here.

1452
01:14:42,250 --> 01:14:43,750
- Hello.
- Hello.

1453
01:14:43,950 --> 01:14:46,040
You gave an application through RTE?

1454
01:14:46,700 --> 01:14:47,790
For admission.

1455
01:14:48,290 --> 01:14:50,290
- You filled that form, didn't you?
- Yes.

1456
01:14:50,500 --> 01:14:51,500
Show me your documents.

1457
01:14:51,620 --> 01:14:52,700
We just showed them too.

1458
01:14:53,540 --> 01:14:54,200
Please take a seat.

1459
01:14:54,330 --> 01:14:55,750
- From Delhi Grammar School.
- I see.

1460
01:14:55,950 --> 01:14:58,040
- Something to eat or drink?
- No, thank you.

1461
01:14:58,160 --> 01:15:00,080
- At least have some tea.
- No, it's okay.

1462
01:15:01,830 --> 01:15:03,750
Here are the documents.

1463
01:15:10,580 --> 01:15:12,620
- Show me your hands.
- Hands are fine.

1464
01:15:12,830 --> 01:15:15,250
Yes, but let me see.

1465
01:15:17,120 --> 01:15:18,250
You have such soft hands.

1466
01:15:18,450 --> 01:15:19,120
Oh mister...

1467
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:20,330
What are you saying?

1468
01:15:20,450 --> 01:15:22,950
They are regular hands... check
the documents.

1469
01:15:23,660 --> 01:15:26,160
I see... they are regular hands.

1470
01:15:26,540 --> 01:15:27,790
Well... truth needs no evidence.

1471
01:15:28,120 --> 01:15:29,120
Let me show you.

1472
01:15:30,080 --> 01:15:31,500
Come here.

1473
01:15:31,790 --> 01:15:33,120
Go on... just answer
his questions correctly.

1474
01:15:33,250 --> 01:15:34,120
Show me your hand.

1475
01:15:34,500 --> 01:15:35,450
Great...

1476
01:15:40,370 --> 01:15:42,500
- Are you a laborer?
- Yes, I am a laborer.

1477
01:15:44,370 --> 01:15:45,500
See here...

1478
01:15:46,290 --> 01:15:48,870
The cracks in nails
are due to heavy lifting.

1479
01:15:49,450 --> 01:15:51,330
Poor guy lifts heavy things.

1480
01:15:52,950 --> 01:15:55,950
Experience says it all.

1481
01:15:58,330 --> 01:15:59,330
- Where are you going?
- What happened?

1482
01:15:59,540 --> 01:16:00,950
- Searching the place, what else?
- Searching.

1483
01:16:01,160 --> 01:16:02,370
Searching.

1484
01:16:02,540 --> 01:16:04,870
Why are your hands so soft?

1485
01:16:04,950 --> 01:16:07,700
There's nothing in our house.
What are you looking for?

1486
01:16:21,410 --> 01:16:22,160
What is this?

1487
01:16:22,250 --> 01:16:25,580
Which poor guy can afford
a pizza and bottled water?

1488
01:16:26,040 --> 01:16:27,080
Where did they get the money?

1489
01:16:27,200 --> 01:16:29,700
We've no money,
how can we afford pizza?

1490
01:16:30,660 --> 01:16:33,120
So mister... what's going on here?

1491
01:16:36,290 --> 01:16:42,580
You know... I had my doubts
when they first came here.

1492
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:45,700
Look at them...

1493
01:16:46,700 --> 01:16:48,500
Blabbering in English...

1494
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:52,120
Thirty Rupees Pizza,
Twenty Rupees mineral water.

1495
01:16:52,370 --> 01:16:54,330
I would never
be able to swallow them.

1496
01:16:57,040 --> 01:16:59,080
And now my doubts are confirmed.

1497
01:17:01,540 --> 01:17:07,160
They were well off... but, something
bad happened to them.

1498
01:17:08,450 --> 01:17:10,200
They suffered a huge blow.

1499
01:17:10,870 --> 01:17:12,790
They went bankrupt.

1500
01:17:12,870 --> 01:17:13,790
Yes...

1501
01:17:14,080 --> 01:17:16,290
These people... they
are nouveau poor.

1502
01:17:16,450 --> 01:17:17,200
Yes...

1503
01:17:18,620 --> 01:17:20,370
- What happened?
- Just like you said...

1504
01:17:20,540 --> 01:17:23,250
- Bankrupt... we went bankrupt.
- But how?

1505
01:17:23,330 --> 01:17:24,370
- There was a fire in our factory.
- Our partner betrayed us.

1506
01:17:24,500 --> 01:17:26,750
- Our partner betrayed us.
- Yes, our partner betrayed us.

1507
01:17:26,830 --> 01:17:28,200
Uhh... the partner was the
responsible for the fire.

1508
01:17:28,330 --> 01:17:29,830
Stop... stop it...

1509
01:17:30,120 --> 01:17:30,620
Stop it.

1510
01:17:30,700 --> 01:17:33,830
Don't keep reminding me. You've
been crying for over a week now.

1511
01:17:33,950 --> 01:17:35,700
Now look you made
my sister-in-law cry.

1512
01:17:35,790 --> 01:17:37,500
Don't keep reminding me.

1513
01:17:37,620 --> 01:17:39,750
We're bankrupt now, there's nothing
we can do to make things right.

1514
01:17:40,040 --> 01:17:41,700
You're absolutely right.

1515
01:17:43,370 --> 01:17:45,370
But if you feed your
children such expensive stuff daily...

1516
01:17:45,540 --> 01:17:47,160
then how will you educate
her in such a big school?

1517
01:17:47,370 --> 01:17:49,080
What to do? It wasn't intentional...

1518
01:17:49,160 --> 01:17:50,080
Such an expensive mistake.

1519
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:51,620
We'll learn... slowly...

1520
01:17:51,700 --> 01:17:54,080
- How can you learn like this?
- What else should I do?

1521
01:17:54,700 --> 01:17:56,250
Living in poverty is an art.

1522
01:17:56,370 --> 01:17:59,120
I'll teach you... because
I have a legacy in poverty.

1523
01:17:59,200 --> 01:18:01,120
My father was poor, grandfather
was poor, my forefathers...

1524
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:02,750
and even their fathers were poor.

1525
01:18:02,910 --> 01:18:04,040
I am from a lineage of poor people.

1526
01:18:04,370 --> 01:18:06,910
Not like you, who were
rich first and then became poor.

1527
01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:08,160
No. We're the pure kind of poor.

1528
01:18:08,450 --> 01:18:11,290
Even we're poor,
but we became rich by accident.

1529
01:18:11,450 --> 01:18:12,410
But now we're poor again.

1530
01:18:12,500 --> 01:18:14,330
You teach them about poverty.

1531
01:18:14,410 --> 01:18:16,450
- Papers are fine.
- Yes, papers are fine.

1532
01:18:17,580 --> 01:18:18,500
We'll see...

1533
01:18:19,250 --> 01:18:20,870
See?
See what?

1534
01:18:21,620 --> 01:18:22,410
What do you mean?

1535
01:18:22,540 --> 01:18:25,660
- Don't chase after him.
- Raj, he said, "We'll see".

1536
01:18:25,750 --> 01:18:27,450
See what?
What will you see?

1537
01:18:27,540 --> 01:18:29,580
Nothing... come back.

1538
01:18:29,790 --> 01:18:31,830
Raj, he said, "We'll see".
What will he see?

1539
01:18:31,950 --> 01:18:33,620
And what is Shyamprakash
going to teach us?

1540
01:18:34,870 --> 01:18:36,450
- He's going to train us.
- Train us for what?

1541
01:18:36,580 --> 01:18:38,500
Train us to be poor... what else?

1542
01:18:38,620 --> 01:18:40,040
- Is he coming back?
- Come on...

1543
01:18:51,410 --> 01:18:54,910
You woke me up too early,
Shyamprakash.

1544
01:18:56,250 --> 01:18:57,620
You woke me up at 5 am...

1545
01:18:57,910 --> 01:19:00,200
We haven't come here
for a walk in the park.

1546
01:19:00,330 --> 01:19:01,330
We need to get to work.

1547
01:19:03,040 --> 01:19:04,500
It's only an hour away.

1548
01:19:06,160 --> 01:19:07,410
What world are you living in?

1549
01:19:07,540 --> 01:19:10,040
Those who travel in their own cars
have a different schedule.

1550
01:19:10,290 --> 01:19:12,700
And those who travel in crowded
buses, have a different schedule.

1551
01:19:14,790 --> 01:19:16,080
Here it comes.

1552
01:19:17,500 --> 01:19:19,290
Come on.

1553
01:19:22,620 --> 01:19:23,910
Stop... stop...

1554
01:19:26,790 --> 01:19:28,370
Careful... careful...

1555
01:19:28,540 --> 01:19:30,540
Shyam, where are you?

1556
01:19:30,830 --> 01:19:33,830
Raj, get in.

1557
01:19:37,370 --> 01:19:40,080
- Climb on.
- There's no way.

1558
01:19:40,290 --> 01:19:41,750
Shyam, where are you?

1559
01:19:41,870 --> 01:19:43,830
I'll be late for my job.

1560
01:19:44,040 --> 01:19:46,410
- Shyam,
- What...

1561
01:19:46,540 --> 01:19:48,080
Hey... wait a minute.

1562
01:19:48,160 --> 01:19:50,160
Hold on...

1563
01:19:50,290 --> 01:19:52,200
My feet are crushed.

1564
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:56,370
Why did you get off?

1565
01:19:56,500 --> 01:19:57,410
Why did you get off?

1566
01:19:57,540 --> 01:19:59,950
- Why did you get off?
- There was no way.

1567
01:20:00,200 --> 01:20:02,250
- It's practically empty.
- Empty?

1568
01:20:02,370 --> 01:20:03,370
You don't need to do Yoga in there.

1569
01:20:03,500 --> 01:20:05,500
There was no place to
get in... you say it's empty.

1570
01:20:06,330 --> 01:20:07,290
We'll catch the next one.

1571
01:20:07,500 --> 01:20:10,080
As if someone's already holding
a seat for you in the next one.

1572
01:20:10,410 --> 01:20:12,040
The next one is completely filled.

1573
01:20:12,200 --> 01:20:14,160
Must be at least 450 people.

1574
01:20:14,330 --> 01:20:15,500
Let's take a rickshaw.

1575
01:20:15,790 --> 01:20:16,290
Rickshaw!

1576
01:20:16,410 --> 01:20:18,410
Hey... we're not going to the bank.

1577
01:20:18,790 --> 01:20:20,000
It will cost us our entire wage.

1578
01:20:20,250 --> 01:20:21,160
Look... here comes the crowded one.

1579
01:20:21,250 --> 01:20:22,250
Just get in...

1580
01:20:22,330 --> 01:20:25,330
Like this... just get in.

1581
01:20:25,500 --> 01:20:26,120
Okay.

1582
01:20:26,200 --> 01:20:27,500
Make way with your
hand and just get in.

1583
01:20:27,790 --> 01:20:28,450
Okay.

1584
01:20:30,700 --> 01:20:31,500
Move aside.

1585
01:20:31,660 --> 01:20:34,160
Move your buckets.
It's my turn now.

1586
01:20:34,370 --> 01:20:36,250
Listen, please don't argue.

1587
01:20:36,330 --> 01:20:39,790
You know this is my turn.
Let me fill water.

1588
01:20:39,870 --> 01:20:42,290
I don't care whose turn it is.

1589
01:20:42,830 --> 01:20:47,910
If you make me mad, I'll smash
this bucket on your head.

1590
01:20:49,040 --> 01:20:50,370
Stop bickering.

1591
01:20:50,790 --> 01:20:52,830
She's new here,
so stop taking advantage of her.

1592
01:20:53,120 --> 01:20:55,700
Doesn't she have a tongue
to speak for herself?

1593
01:20:56,040 --> 01:20:58,870
- Stop being her aunt.
- You stop being over-smart.

1594
01:21:00,620 --> 01:21:01,000
Let it be.

1595
01:21:01,120 --> 01:21:04,290
- Sister-in-law... she is right.
- What?

1596
01:21:04,500 --> 01:21:06,450
This is your battle,
and you must fight it.

1597
01:21:06,580 --> 01:21:10,080
Do you want water
for your family, or not?

1598
01:21:14,700 --> 01:21:16,040
You...

1599
01:21:16,700 --> 01:21:17,830
Crazy wretch.

1600
01:21:20,250 --> 01:21:21,660
You waste!

1601
01:21:22,290 --> 01:21:23,790
You burden on earth!

1602
01:21:24,580 --> 01:21:28,040
I've been telling you to get
your bloody bucket out of the way.

1603
01:21:28,370 --> 01:21:30,580
I'll break your
head with this bucket.

1604
01:21:30,660 --> 01:21:32,200
I am really fed up...

1605
01:21:33,540 --> 01:21:34,370
Witch!

1606
01:21:34,580 --> 01:21:35,290
Move!

1607
01:21:35,700 --> 01:21:37,410
Give me the water-hose.

1608
01:21:39,330 --> 01:21:42,120
If anyone else has
a problem then say it now.

1609
01:21:43,370 --> 01:21:45,120
Don't get so violent.

1610
01:21:45,200 --> 01:21:46,200
We're only looking to fill water...

1611
01:21:46,290 --> 01:21:48,160
and not throw someone
out of their house.

1612
01:21:51,330 --> 01:21:52,620
Nice one, sister-in-law.

1613
01:21:53,750 --> 01:21:55,500
What was that you said?

1614
01:21:56,500 --> 01:21:57,290
Witch?

1615
01:21:58,250 --> 01:21:58,870
Huh?

1616
01:22:09,910 --> 01:22:12,200
Now watch...
Watch carefully what you need to do.

1617
01:22:12,330 --> 01:22:13,410
Pick it up from here...

1618
01:22:13,500 --> 01:22:16,040
Two in this hand
and two in this one...

1619
01:22:16,250 --> 01:22:18,910
Don't waste any of it. Okay.

1620
01:22:19,540 --> 01:22:21,200
I've taken care of
more complex businesses.

1621
01:22:21,330 --> 01:22:22,870
Can you handle it?

1622
01:22:23,160 --> 01:22:24,160
Yes, I can.

1623
01:22:24,330 --> 01:22:25,200
Come on then.

1624
01:22:36,200 --> 01:22:38,200
Shyamprakash, what's happening?

1625
01:22:40,620 --> 01:22:42,620
What are you doing?

1626
01:22:42,870 --> 01:22:45,370
Oh no... that's not how it's done.

1627
01:22:45,540 --> 01:22:47,250
Work faster.

1628
01:22:47,410 --> 01:22:50,040
- Turn this thing off.
- Take two at a time.

1629
01:22:50,160 --> 01:22:52,410
- Turn this thing off.
- You can't do a single thing.

1630
01:22:52,870 --> 01:22:56,080
Come on... come...
What have you done?

1631
01:22:56,200 --> 01:22:57,410
Who died now?

1632
01:22:57,500 --> 01:22:58,500
Who turned off the machine?

1633
01:22:58,620 --> 01:23:00,790
- Who turned it off?
- You did.

1634
01:23:01,080 --> 01:23:02,620
Your machine isn't
working... it's too fast.

1635
01:23:02,700 --> 01:23:04,120
Who says it's not working.

1636
01:23:04,250 --> 01:23:05,120
That one's too fast.
This one's too slow.

1637
01:23:05,200 --> 01:23:06,410
How's that possible?

1638
01:23:07,160 --> 01:23:08,250
I'm going to deduct your wages.

1639
01:23:08,330 --> 01:23:10,040
- Deduct my wages?
- Yes, I will.

1640
01:23:10,370 --> 01:23:11,580
Come, sister-in-law.

1641
01:23:11,950 --> 01:23:13,370
One kg of rice.

1642
01:23:18,500 --> 01:23:20,040
Weigh it properly.

1643
01:23:20,450 --> 01:23:22,200
Are you buying rice or silver?

1644
01:23:22,830 --> 01:23:24,200
Do you want me to weigh it in grams?

1645
01:23:24,370 --> 01:23:26,540
Take it or leave it. Go.

1646
01:23:27,330 --> 01:23:29,450
- What's wrong now?
- Hold on, sister.

1647
01:23:29,700 --> 01:23:30,950
I know how to deal with him.

1648
01:23:31,160 --> 01:23:32,200
You rascal.

1649
01:23:32,330 --> 01:23:33,330
What?

1650
01:23:33,580 --> 01:23:34,950
I am talking to you.

1651
01:23:35,080 --> 01:23:36,750
- I am being so polite, but you don't seem to get it...
- No-no-no...

1652
01:23:36,870 --> 01:23:38,410
What no?
I am going to show him.

1653
01:23:38,500 --> 01:23:40,200
You dog, cheat...

1654
01:23:40,410 --> 01:23:41,540
Mind your language.

1655
01:23:41,660 --> 01:23:44,200
I may be new around here, but I
know how to deal with your kind.

1656
01:23:44,330 --> 01:23:45,830
- Are you new here?
- Apologize for what?

1657
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:46,830
She's not from here.

1658
01:23:46,910 --> 01:23:49,700
I told you to weigh rice,
just do that...

1659
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,410
She's new here, please forgive her.

1660
01:23:52,500 --> 01:23:55,790
Close the shutter.
No rations for you.

1661
01:23:56,120 --> 01:23:59,700
Open up.
Open up.

1662
01:23:59,910 --> 01:24:03,000
- I'll explain to her.
- What's the point now?

1663
01:24:03,830 --> 01:24:06,040
- Sister-in-law, let's go...
- Our entire day's wasted now.

1664
01:24:06,160 --> 01:24:07,870
What happened? What did I do now?

1665
01:24:08,040 --> 01:24:09,290
What have you done, sister-in-law?

1666
01:24:09,410 --> 01:24:11,790
You taught me to fight for my right,
and not to be scared of anyone.

1667
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,700
He works for the government,
he'll make your life hell.

1668
01:24:15,500 --> 01:24:17,410
You didn't even stop to
think before yelling at him.

1669
01:24:17,950 --> 01:24:19,950
Fight-don't fight...

1670
01:24:20,330 --> 01:24:22,500
Why can't you tell
me everything properly?

1671
01:24:23,330 --> 01:24:26,870
Poverty... cannot be taught so easily.

1672
01:24:41,250 --> 01:24:42,500
- Hey.
- Yeah...

1673
01:24:45,040 --> 01:24:46,500
He's back again.

1674
01:24:47,870 --> 01:24:49,580
- Where?
- Mister...

1675
01:24:50,160 --> 01:24:52,250
You've exhausted your chances
to go to the bathroom.

1676
01:24:52,330 --> 01:24:53,410
Now you can go only after lunch.

1677
01:24:53,500 --> 01:24:55,000
- I exhausted my chance.
- Yes.

1678
01:24:55,910 --> 01:24:56,910
I exhausted my chance.

1679
01:24:57,040 --> 01:25:00,290
You can only go twice... once
before and once after lunch.

1680
01:25:00,410 --> 01:25:02,080
What if someone needs
to go for the third time?

1681
01:25:02,200 --> 01:25:05,200
Stupid... remember this.

1682
01:25:05,450 --> 01:25:08,250
One man needs 1Â½ minutes
to get to the bathroom.

1683
01:25:08,330 --> 01:25:09,830
One minute to pee.

1684
01:25:09,910 --> 01:25:11,500
One minute to wash his hands,

1685
01:25:11,580 --> 01:25:13,620
And 1Â½ minutes to come back.

1686
01:25:13,910 --> 01:25:15,870
So how much is that? Five minutes.

1687
01:25:15,950 --> 01:25:17,370
- Five minutes?
- Yes.

1688
01:25:17,450 --> 01:25:20,250
If 400 employees of the company
spend 5 minutes in the bathroom...

1689
01:25:20,330 --> 01:25:22,250
then the company loses 33 hours.

1690
01:25:22,330 --> 01:25:23,370
33 hours.

1691
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:26,750
You can deduct whatever
is apt for 5 minutes...

1692
01:25:26,870 --> 01:25:28,250
I cannot wait anymore.

1693
01:25:28,330 --> 01:25:30,700
Wait...
Hey... stupid.

1694
01:25:36,910 --> 01:25:39,700
You didn't have to
fight with the ration guy.

1695
01:25:40,500 --> 01:25:44,500
Raj, don't blame me without
knowing the entire story.

1696
01:25:45,660 --> 01:25:47,500
Do you know how to spell 'fight'?

1697
01:25:48,370 --> 01:25:50,790
I can only spell 'deduct money'.

1698
01:25:50,910 --> 01:25:53,950
'Deduct money.'

1699
01:25:58,040 --> 01:26:00,540
You didn't give me your wages.

1700
01:26:05,830 --> 01:26:08,370
They deducted more
than I earned today.

1701
01:26:09,660 --> 01:26:13,700
Shyamprakash gave me
some money from his wages.

1702
01:26:13,870 --> 01:26:17,200
He said 'A father should
never go home empty-handed'.

1703
01:26:19,330 --> 01:26:25,330
Even Tulsi gave me half her rations.

1704
01:26:27,870 --> 01:26:30,540
They know what it feels
like to sleep on an empty stomach.

1705
01:26:30,620 --> 01:26:31,660
Yes, exactly.

1706
01:26:33,040 --> 01:26:36,040
I wish this inspection
gets over soon... and we go home.

1707
01:26:36,160 --> 01:26:39,620
I wonder how long
can we keep up with this lie?

1708
01:26:45,330 --> 01:26:46,580
Raj...

1709
01:26:48,290 --> 01:26:50,370
I think the rat is back again.

1710
01:26:51,910 --> 01:26:53,950
Let this one stay.

1711
01:27:10,200 --> 01:27:13,580
"Not before men,
but before the almighty."

1712
01:27:14,040 --> 01:27:17,040
"Before every name of the lord."

1713
01:27:17,620 --> 01:27:20,500
"Before every devout and atheist."

1714
01:27:21,290 --> 01:27:24,250
"Before the omnipresent one."

1715
01:27:24,450 --> 01:27:28,450
"Kabir stands proud and poor."

1716
01:27:28,750 --> 01:27:32,120
"Kabir stands a renunciate."

1717
01:27:32,370 --> 01:27:35,910
"Unafraid of the world,
he speaks the truth."

1718
01:27:36,080 --> 01:27:39,500
"What can one steal from him
if his sack is empty?"

1719
01:27:39,700 --> 01:27:43,040
"There's a lot of power in poverty."

1720
01:27:43,330 --> 01:27:47,330
"The joy of singing the lord's name."

1721
01:27:50,540 --> 01:27:54,200
"The joy of singing the lord's name."

1722
01:27:54,330 --> 01:27:57,870
"The joy of singing the lord's name."

1723
01:27:58,040 --> 01:28:00,830
"Wealth cannot bring us such joy."

1724
01:28:01,580 --> 01:28:04,370
"Wealth cannot bring us such joy."

1725
01:28:04,450 --> 01:28:07,910
"The heart rejoices in poverty."

1726
01:28:12,330 --> 01:28:15,450
Glory to Goddess!

1727
01:28:15,870 --> 01:28:19,290
Glory to Goddess!

1728
01:28:19,500 --> 01:28:22,580
Glory to Goddess!

1729
01:28:25,750 --> 01:28:26,700
Thank you.

1730
01:28:27,750 --> 01:28:30,580
You don't take sugar
in your tea, right?

1731
01:28:31,370 --> 01:28:32,870
Of course, I do.

1732
01:28:33,080 --> 01:28:34,660
I don't have any sugar problem.

1733
01:28:34,750 --> 01:28:37,620
But we do... have a sugar problem.

1734
01:28:37,700 --> 01:28:39,500
We've run out of rations.

1735
01:28:42,330 --> 01:28:43,660
Water's fine.

1736
01:28:44,040 --> 01:28:45,040
Okay.

1737
01:28:47,370 --> 01:28:50,620
So mister... working
hard at the factory?

1738
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:52,290
Just trying to fit in.

1739
01:28:52,620 --> 01:28:55,620
Look at his hands now.

1740
01:28:55,910 --> 01:28:57,910
- See the difference.
- Yes... I can see the difference.

1741
01:28:58,200 --> 01:28:59,830
He can break a brick with a punch now.

1742
01:29:01,830 --> 01:29:03,290
You were right.

1743
01:29:03,370 --> 01:29:05,290
I was unnecessarily doubting such nice
people.

1744
01:29:06,290 --> 01:29:08,750
- You'll get it.
- We will.

1745
01:29:10,330 --> 01:29:12,450
We'll get the admission?

1746
01:29:13,290 --> 01:29:17,370
Thank you... thank you.

1747
01:29:17,450 --> 01:29:20,080
- Congratulations, sister-in-law.
- Thank you, mister.

1748
01:29:20,200 --> 01:29:21,250
Amazing.

1749
01:29:22,660 --> 01:29:24,250
This is nice...

1750
01:29:24,830 --> 01:29:26,410
All you need to do is deposit
24000 rupees in the school.

1751
01:29:26,500 --> 01:29:28,450
- We'll do it.
- What?

1752
01:29:29,160 --> 01:29:31,500
24,000?

1753
01:29:32,290 --> 01:29:34,370
- 24,000?
- 24,000?

1754
01:29:34,700 --> 01:29:36,660
But we applied through RTE.

1755
01:29:36,870 --> 01:29:38,370
So our children's
admission should be free.

1756
01:29:38,540 --> 01:29:39,580
So who said anything about fees?

1757
01:29:39,700 --> 01:29:41,000
- The fee is waived off.
- Then?

1758
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:43,290
This is for
extra-curricular activities.

1759
01:29:43,950 --> 01:29:45,250
Extra...

1760
01:29:45,330 --> 01:29:48,080
- Extra, what?
- Extracurricular activities.

1761
01:29:48,250 --> 01:29:50,950
Like we take the children
to the park for a picnic...

1762
01:29:51,040 --> 01:29:54,620
or dress them up like
animals and perform on stage.

1763
01:29:54,950 --> 01:29:56,000
And more... Annual Function.

1764
01:29:56,120 --> 01:29:59,250
All they do is extra-curricular
activities all day.

1765
01:29:59,370 --> 01:30:02,080
We're sending our children
there to study, not to sing and dance.

1766
01:30:02,200 --> 01:30:04,540
It's called personality development.

1767
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:06,830
Where do we get 24,000...

1768
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:08,290
We'll take a loan,
or borrow it from someone.

1769
01:30:08,370 --> 01:30:10,870
- You do?
- We do-we do.

1770
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:12,580
- Are you sure?
- Don't worry.

1771
01:30:12,950 --> 01:30:15,660
But... what about him?

1772
01:30:15,830 --> 01:30:17,410
We'll manage...
Raj will manage.

1773
01:30:17,700 --> 01:30:18,910
I'll take a loan...

1774
01:30:19,120 --> 01:30:21,370
You don't even have a fixed job.

1775
01:30:21,450 --> 01:30:23,000
What are you saying, brother Shyam?

1776
01:30:23,120 --> 01:30:25,000
I am right, sister-in-law. Ask him.

1777
01:30:25,080 --> 01:30:26,870
Fine then, enroll her in
some government school.

1778
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:28,290
No-no-no...

1779
01:30:28,410 --> 01:30:31,250
Pia will do everything
that the other kids do, Raj.

1780
01:30:31,450 --> 01:30:32,830
But how, sister-in-law?

1781
01:30:33,040 --> 01:30:34,290
You must arrange for the money too.

1782
01:30:34,870 --> 01:30:35,450
I'll manage.

1783
01:30:35,660 --> 01:30:37,370
H... how?
Will you rob a bank?

1784
01:30:37,450 --> 01:30:39,500
So what's your final decision?
Can you... or not?

1785
01:30:39,700 --> 01:30:41,410
Raj will do it.
Say it, Raj.

1786
01:30:41,660 --> 01:30:43,200
We'll do it.

1787
01:31:28,250 --> 01:31:30,450
Hey... what are you doing?

1788
01:31:33,290 --> 01:31:37,290
I'm arranging the money...
Stealing from the machine.

1789
01:31:37,410 --> 01:31:40,160
Have you lost your mind?
You're stealing.

1790
01:31:40,450 --> 01:31:43,950
Look there... The police are watching,
along with the bank guys.

1791
01:31:44,330 --> 01:31:46,200
- No one's watching.
- Let's go.

1792
01:31:46,290 --> 01:31:48,580
- I need money for the kids.
- Come on.

1793
01:31:48,700 --> 01:31:50,620
- Stop arguing.
- I need the money...

1794
01:31:50,830 --> 01:31:52,830
And you're stealing for it.

1795
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:54,830
Money... it's here...

1796
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,910
The money's out.

1797
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:01,080
- It'll stay there.
- We don't want it.

1798
01:32:01,200 --> 01:32:03,700
- Stealing...
- Leave me.

1799
01:32:04,700 --> 01:32:06,830
What? What?
I was doing it for my kid.

1800
01:32:06,950 --> 01:32:09,290
I know. But you shouldn't steal.

1801
01:32:09,540 --> 01:32:11,450
Listen... go home and sleep.

1802
01:32:12,040 --> 01:32:13,950
I'll go make some arrangements.

1803
01:32:14,080 --> 01:32:16,160
Not that again.

1804
01:32:16,330 --> 01:32:18,450
You're not in the right mind.
I can't leave you alone.

1805
01:32:18,580 --> 01:32:20,120
You don't get it.

1806
01:32:22,290 --> 01:32:23,950
- Try to understand...
- Fine, listen.

1807
01:32:24,040 --> 01:32:25,580
I'll go pee, you just wait here.

1808
01:32:25,660 --> 01:32:28,200
Don't move.
I'll be right back.

1809
01:32:34,120 --> 01:32:39,160
Shyamprakash. Shyamprakash.
Hey... hey...

1810
01:32:39,620 --> 01:32:41,370
Don't you look where you're going?

1811
01:32:41,830 --> 01:32:43,700
He came out of nowhere
in front of my car.

1812
01:32:43,830 --> 01:32:45,830
- What are you doing mister?
- Why would we come in front of your car.

1813
01:32:45,950 --> 01:32:47,660
Listen to me, brother.

1814
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:49,580
Look what you've done. Look at him.

1815
01:32:49,750 --> 01:32:51,790
Park your car on the side.
Park...

1816
01:32:51,950 --> 01:32:54,290
You can explain the police now...

1817
01:32:54,370 --> 01:32:55,580
No, no, no Raj.

1818
01:32:55,700 --> 01:32:57,790
- No police... No police...
- Please...

1819
01:32:57,910 --> 01:33:00,410
Let's just settle it out here.
Let's settle it here.

1820
01:33:00,580 --> 01:33:02,080
How much?

1821
01:33:02,200 --> 01:33:04,200
- Keep your money...
- Raj.

1822
01:33:04,330 --> 01:33:06,830
We're both at fault,
let's just settle it right here.

1823
01:33:06,910 --> 01:33:07,870
Keep this...

1824
01:33:08,040 --> 01:33:11,370
- No money... Don't take the money.
- Let it be.

1825
01:33:11,450 --> 01:33:14,370
Take some more.
Take this.

1826
01:33:14,750 --> 01:33:16,950
- Take him to the hospital.
- Yes, mister.

1827
01:33:17,200 --> 01:33:18,950
- Take me to the clinic.
- Get in the car.

1828
01:33:19,040 --> 01:33:19,950
It's nearby.

1829
01:33:20,950 --> 01:33:22,870
- Take this...
- What?

1830
01:33:23,330 --> 01:33:24,910
It's 20700...

1831
01:33:25,330 --> 01:33:27,160
We're just short of 3300 now.

1832
01:33:27,450 --> 01:33:28,910
So Pia's admission is taken care of.

1833
01:33:30,080 --> 01:33:31,870
You jumped in front
of the car for this?

1834
01:33:32,700 --> 01:33:33,870
So what?

1835
01:33:34,200 --> 01:33:36,200
Who stakes his own life for money?

1836
01:33:36,500 --> 01:33:40,120
I don't have anything
else to put on stake.

1837
01:33:41,410 --> 01:33:43,700
Do you want to enroll
Pia in a government school?

1838
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:45,290
- Come on, you're next.
- Are you mad?

1839
01:33:45,410 --> 01:33:47,700
It's nothing.
Stop exaggerating.

1840
01:33:47,910 --> 01:33:49,000
Remember Sanjay.

1841
01:33:49,250 --> 01:33:50,500
He keeps jumping in
front of vehicles like this.

1842
01:33:50,700 --> 01:33:52,450
Thank God no injury to the head.

1843
01:33:53,160 --> 01:33:54,370
I'll be right back.

1844
01:34:09,750 --> 01:34:11,410
Today's breaking news.

1845
01:34:11,500 --> 01:34:16,040
Delhi Grammar School,
one of the well known schools of Delhi..

1846
01:34:16,160 --> 01:34:19,660
has cancelled 10 admissions in
the RTE quota under Operation Admission.

1847
01:34:19,750 --> 01:34:23,080
In order to prevent anymore frauds...

1848
01:34:23,200 --> 01:34:25,830
Principal Lodha will organize
the lottery personally.

1849
01:34:31,120 --> 01:34:32,910
Welcome parents and children.

1850
01:34:33,200 --> 01:34:35,120
We'll conduct a lottery...

1851
01:34:35,660 --> 01:34:37,080
for children who
have applied under RTE.

1852
01:34:37,330 --> 01:34:40,620
The names of your children
are written on these chits of paper.

1853
01:34:41,250 --> 01:34:44,370
Names that are drawn
will be announced here...

1854
01:34:44,660 --> 01:34:48,120
and that child will be registered
for admission in our school.

1855
01:34:49,120 --> 01:34:49,950
Good luck.

1856
01:34:54,910 --> 01:34:56,250
Vineeta Bhagu.

1857
01:34:56,750 --> 01:34:57,870
Oh...!

1858
01:35:07,500 --> 01:35:08,620
Mohammad Sheikh.

1859
01:35:12,660 --> 01:35:14,120
Rattan Maurya.

1860
01:35:17,450 --> 01:35:19,200
Raghav Kumar.

1861
01:35:23,830 --> 01:35:25,080
Pia Batra...

1862
01:35:26,910 --> 01:35:29,910
That's us...
We've got it.

1863
01:35:30,330 --> 01:35:33,330
- I am sure yours will be next...
- Yes.

1864
01:35:35,160 --> 01:35:36,330
We're next.

1865
01:35:39,580 --> 01:35:41,450
Akanksha Sharma.

1866
01:35:50,540 --> 01:35:52,000
Shankar Dubey.

1867
01:35:52,160 --> 01:35:55,830
- Papa, when will my name be announced?
- Soon, son... soon.

1868
01:36:00,620 --> 01:36:02,580
And the last name is...

1869
01:36:08,950 --> 01:36:10,200
Amol Majhi.

1870
01:36:11,660 --> 01:36:15,290
Congratulations to all those
who have been selected today.

1871
01:36:15,500 --> 01:36:19,410
And we apologize to
those who weren't so lucky.

1872
01:36:19,660 --> 01:36:21,620
But don't be disappointed.

1873
01:36:21,910 --> 01:36:25,540
There are other good schools,
you can try there.

1874
01:36:40,830 --> 01:36:42,290
Sorry, father.

1875
01:36:45,080 --> 01:36:47,080
Son, it was a lottery...

1876
01:36:47,750 --> 01:36:50,290
You know... a lottery... Where
the results are determined by luck.

1877
01:36:50,580 --> 01:36:53,200
So... are we not lucky, father?

1878
01:36:55,450 --> 01:36:57,290
Who said that?

1879
01:36:58,330 --> 01:37:00,000
You're the luckiest of the lot.

1880
01:37:00,620 --> 01:37:03,450
A school admission is not
going to determine your luck.

1881
01:37:03,750 --> 01:37:05,910
This school is unlucky.

1882
01:37:12,080 --> 01:37:14,290
You're the luckiest of the lot.

1883
01:37:15,410 --> 01:37:20,000
Hey... Sorry... sorry...

1884
01:37:20,290 --> 01:37:22,660
Why are you sulking?

1885
01:37:23,200 --> 01:37:25,950
You make it sound
like you took his seat.

1886
01:37:27,910 --> 01:37:29,290
Forget it...

1887
01:37:31,620 --> 01:37:32,870
That's the thing with the poor...

1888
01:37:33,080 --> 01:37:35,330
You can't be too happy if you succeed
and you can't be too sad if you fail.

1889
01:37:35,620 --> 01:37:37,620
He'll study in government school,
it's alright.

1890
01:37:38,250 --> 01:37:39,250
He will.

1891
01:37:40,330 --> 01:37:41,330
He will.

1892
01:37:41,950 --> 01:37:43,290
We're going to party tonight,
stop sulking all of you.

1893
01:37:43,450 --> 01:37:45,620
- We're going to party.
- No, Shyam. - Yes.

1894
01:37:45,750 --> 01:37:46,830
- She got admission.
- Yes...

1895
01:37:46,950 --> 01:37:49,620
- Don't do this...
- No. - Please...

1896
01:37:50,290 --> 01:37:52,250
- Don't do this...
- No need for all this trouble.

1897
01:37:52,370 --> 01:37:53,580
We're going to have a party.

1898
01:37:53,700 --> 01:37:56,450
- One... two...
- I'll count it.

1899
01:37:56,700 --> 01:37:58,580
Come on children.

1900
01:37:59,500 --> 01:38:01,410
What would you like to eat today?
How about pizzas and burgers?

1901
01:38:14,080 --> 01:38:15,410
I wish you could stay a few more days.

1902
01:38:15,500 --> 01:38:19,330
He's got a job,
close to the school.

1903
01:38:19,580 --> 01:38:23,370
They have a place
to stay... water 24/7.

1904
01:38:23,700 --> 01:38:25,540
Grow all you want,
but don't forget about us.

1905
01:38:25,620 --> 01:38:27,660
Brother, I'll never forget you.

1906
01:38:27,830 --> 01:38:30,830
- What's this?
- Ration.

1907
01:38:31,250 --> 01:38:32,660
It will last a day or two.

1908
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:35,700
- Take care, sister-in-law.
- Take care.

1909
01:38:36,040 --> 01:38:37,540
See you, sister-in-law.

1910
01:38:37,870 --> 01:38:39,120
Take care.

1911
01:38:40,290 --> 01:38:41,290
Bye.

1912
01:38:42,290 --> 01:38:43,080
Bye.

1913
01:38:43,910 --> 01:38:46,160
Be careful... or he'll take
the longer route and charge extra.

1914
01:38:46,660 --> 01:38:48,290
See you, sister-in-law.

1915
01:38:48,450 --> 01:38:50,040
- Send your address.
- Yes, I will.

1916
01:39:00,040 --> 01:39:03,450
Bye Mohan!

1917
01:39:13,700 --> 01:39:18,330
Mr. Kapoor from B-76
has sent us an invitation.

1918
01:39:21,290 --> 01:39:25,500
Kapoors... Suris... Bhatindas...
I've had enough of them.

1919
01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:27,830
How long are we going
to carry on this charade?

1920
01:39:34,910 --> 01:39:36,200
Eat your food.

1921
01:39:36,700 --> 01:39:38,120
It's your favorite dish.

1922
01:39:45,080 --> 01:39:46,950
Just imagine Mitho...

1923
01:39:47,580 --> 01:39:50,620
That guy jumped in front of
a car for our daughter's admission.

1924
01:39:50,700 --> 01:39:52,370
He put his life at stake.

1925
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:58,830
We're such bastards.

1926
01:40:03,620 --> 01:40:05,620
We stole his son's seat.

1927
01:40:27,120 --> 01:40:30,370
Even I went to a government
school but it was never this bad.

1928
01:40:30,620 --> 01:40:32,290
It was different back then.

1929
01:40:32,700 --> 01:40:35,950
These days every parent wants
private schools for their children.

1930
01:40:36,700 --> 01:40:38,580
Only the underprivileged
kids come here.

1931
01:40:38,700 --> 01:40:40,700
And no one cares about them.

1932
01:40:41,620 --> 01:40:42,950
We do...

1933
01:40:43,040 --> 01:40:45,620
Which is why we want
to make a small contribution.

1934
01:40:45,700 --> 01:40:46,830
- I see...
- Yes.

1935
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:48,290
Come with me.

1936
01:40:48,410 --> 01:40:51,370
- Hello, sir.
- Hello-hello...

1937
01:40:53,410 --> 01:40:58,580
You see, these children
are sitting on rugs and mats.

1938
01:40:58,910 --> 01:41:03,700
For just 50,000 we can
provide benches for all.

1939
01:41:04,700 --> 01:41:08,620
And... whenever the kids will
pick up their books to read...

1940
01:41:08,700 --> 01:41:11,660
they will see your name.

1941
01:41:12,080 --> 01:41:13,910
On all the benches?

1942
01:41:14,700 --> 01:41:17,620
- What? Is it too much?
- No-no...

1943
01:41:17,870 --> 01:41:20,160
- Let me show you around. Come.
- Yes.

1944
01:41:20,500 --> 01:41:25,500
For Rupees 25,000 only,
the toilets can be fixed.

1945
01:41:25,750 --> 01:41:29,750
Imagine... whenever the kids
will come to use the toilet

1946
01:41:29,830 --> 01:41:32,870
they will see your
name written over here.

1947
01:41:33,370 --> 01:41:36,580
Actually, sir, we don't
want our names to be written anywhere.

1948
01:41:36,700 --> 01:41:39,830
- We just want to help.
- Wow.

1949
01:41:41,450 --> 01:41:45,450
It's hard to find anonymous
donors these days.

1950
01:41:45,700 --> 01:41:46,750
Great.

1951
01:41:46,910 --> 01:41:49,790
What is that you would like to do?

1952
01:41:51,250 --> 01:41:54,870
Actually... we would like to
sponsor the education of any one kid.

1953
01:41:55,250 --> 01:41:56,080
I see...

1954
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:58,700
Raju, come here.

1955
01:42:03,830 --> 01:42:08,000
Now ask them... can I
show you around the school?

1956
01:42:08,370 --> 01:42:10,410
Can I give you a tour of the school?

1957
01:42:10,700 --> 01:42:13,500
Wow... your English is pretty good.

1958
01:42:13,700 --> 01:42:16,250
- I can speak French as well.
- I see.

1959
01:42:16,450 --> 01:42:19,080
[SPEAKING FRENCH]

1960
01:42:20,950 --> 01:42:22,620
I can even speak Chinese.

1961
01:42:23,330 --> 01:42:24,080
Do tell.

1962
01:42:24,450 --> 01:42:27,660
[SPEAKING CHINESE]

1963
01:42:28,700 --> 01:42:30,410
How do you know so many languages?

1964
01:42:30,580 --> 01:42:32,080
My father is a tourist guide.

1965
01:42:32,330 --> 01:42:34,660
Sometimes I would
tag along with him...

1966
01:42:34,950 --> 01:42:38,660
and observe how different
people would talk.

1967
01:42:39,080 --> 01:42:40,040
Cute.

1968
01:42:40,120 --> 01:42:42,540
Bravo, son. Bravo.

1969
01:42:57,250 --> 01:42:59,910
We've many talented
children like them.

1970
01:43:00,330 --> 01:43:02,580
But you want to sponsor
just one, right?

1971
01:43:02,700 --> 01:43:03,870
So choose anyone.

1972
01:43:05,700 --> 01:43:07,870
On second thought,
we'll sponsor all of them.

1973
01:43:07,950 --> 01:43:10,950
What's the point of sponsoring just one
kid? The entire school should benefit.

1974
01:43:12,580 --> 01:43:13,660
Thank you very much.

1975
01:44:09,910 --> 01:44:11,870
"We'll shine like the sun..."

1976
01:44:11,950 --> 01:44:16,250
"we dream to touch the sky."

1977
01:44:16,700 --> 01:44:18,870
"to touch the sky."

1978
01:44:19,410 --> 01:44:25,870
"We'll gather drop by
drop and flow away with the sea."

1979
01:44:26,080 --> 01:44:28,080
"Away with the sea."

1980
01:44:28,500 --> 01:44:31,750
"We're here right now..."

1981
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,040
"but we want to go beyond."

1982
01:44:34,370 --> 01:44:37,660
"Don't think we can't."

1983
01:44:37,790 --> 01:44:41,040
"We're determined..."

1984
01:44:41,450 --> 01:44:43,580
"and obsessed too."

1985
01:44:43,700 --> 01:44:45,700
"Say it out loud..."

1986
01:44:46,120 --> 01:44:52,040
"I've one life... and
a hundred desires."

1987
01:44:52,330 --> 01:44:55,330
"I'll fulfill them one by one."

1988
01:44:55,540 --> 01:45:01,540
"I've one life... and
a hundred desires."

1989
01:45:01,700 --> 01:45:04,750
"I'll fulfill them one by one."

1990
01:45:04,870 --> 01:45:10,750
"I've one life... and
a hundred desires."

1991
01:45:11,040 --> 01:45:14,700
"Nothing can stop us now."

1992
01:45:15,950 --> 01:45:17,700
Bits of paper...

1993
01:45:17,870 --> 01:45:19,700
Bits of paper...

1994
01:45:19,910 --> 01:45:21,370
Lying on the floor.

1995
01:45:21,500 --> 01:45:23,080
Lying on the floor.

1996
01:45:23,410 --> 01:45:25,370
Makes the place untidy.

1997
01:45:25,450 --> 01:45:27,200
Makes the place untidy.

1998
01:45:27,410 --> 01:45:28,910
Pick them up.

1999
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:30,660
Pick them up.

2000
01:45:30,870 --> 01:45:33,620
Very good, son.
Go to your classroom.

2001
01:45:36,580 --> 01:45:37,540
See...

2002
01:45:37,700 --> 01:45:41,080
Can anyone believe that a
laborer's son is speaking in English?

2003
01:45:41,950 --> 01:45:44,290
Sir what you did is truly a miracle.

2004
01:45:45,620 --> 01:45:49,500
Look... I didn't do anything.

2005
01:45:49,700 --> 01:45:54,580
The changes that you see are
because of some other people.

2006
01:45:55,410 --> 01:45:56,910
Who are they?

2007
01:45:57,000 --> 01:46:00,450
Can I get their name and address?
I want to thank them.

2008
01:46:00,830 --> 01:46:02,540
They are such great people, that...

2009
01:46:02,660 --> 01:46:05,330
they do not want
to disclose their name.

2010
01:46:05,500 --> 01:46:10,040
Do let me know if they ever come
to school, I would love to meet them.

2011
01:46:10,290 --> 01:46:11,250
Bye.

2012
01:46:11,450 --> 01:46:12,370
Wait...

2013
01:46:22,410 --> 01:46:24,830
32... this is the one.

2014
01:46:26,700 --> 01:46:27,870
Mister...

2015
01:46:30,620 --> 01:46:31,620
Hello.

2016
01:46:34,790 --> 01:46:38,870
Sushila... why don't you carry...

2017
01:46:39,910 --> 01:46:40,910
Oh...

2018
01:46:42,080 --> 01:46:44,040
- Raj?
- What happened?

2019
01:46:45,750 --> 01:46:47,540
What are you doing here?

2020
01:46:49,290 --> 01:46:53,040
What am I doing?
What are you doing here?

2021
01:46:53,410 --> 01:46:58,450
- Now I get it...
- No-no... listen to me...

2022
01:46:58,700 --> 01:47:00,620
You think I am stupid.

2023
01:47:01,910 --> 01:47:03,450
Listen to me...

2024
01:47:03,660 --> 01:47:06,660
You put in a recommendation
to your boss for Mohan.

2025
01:47:08,200 --> 01:47:08,700
Isn't it?

2026
01:47:08,790 --> 01:47:11,500
I did put in a recommendation
to your boss for Mohan.

2027
01:47:11,750 --> 01:47:14,000
You didn't forget about Mohan.

2028
01:47:14,370 --> 01:47:16,750
- How can I forget him?
- So what's new?

2029
01:47:17,250 --> 01:47:19,790
My boss is a great man.
He helps everyone out.

2030
01:47:19,870 --> 01:47:21,660
- Look at my clothes.
- Wow!

2031
01:47:21,790 --> 01:47:23,950
- He even lets me eat with him.
- I see...

2032
01:47:24,080 --> 01:47:25,370
He's a great man.

2033
01:47:25,660 --> 01:47:29,700
You know, he completely
turned Mohan's school around.

2034
01:47:30,750 --> 01:47:33,500
- Where is your boss?
- Boss... he isn't here. He's out.

2035
01:47:33,700 --> 01:47:35,290
I want to thank him.

2036
01:47:35,580 --> 01:47:37,500
I'll thank him for you.

2037
01:47:37,580 --> 01:47:39,750
- Give him this.
- I'll tell him Shyam was here.

2038
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:41,410
- I hope I get to see that generous man.
- Shyam was very happy.

2039
01:47:41,540 --> 01:47:43,200
The school got a complete make over.

2040
01:47:43,290 --> 01:47:43,910
He was very happy.

2041
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:45,700
He brought bananas for you.

2042
01:47:46,040 --> 01:47:48,580
Wow... what a house.

2043
01:47:49,410 --> 01:47:50,410
Great.

2044
01:47:53,540 --> 01:47:54,910
What a house!

2045
01:47:55,330 --> 01:47:57,290
- You're really living it up.
- Yeah... true.

2046
01:47:57,370 --> 01:47:58,870
You see Shyam...

2047
01:48:00,620 --> 01:48:01,830
- Leave now...
- Where?

2048
01:48:01,910 --> 01:48:03,910
- I'll tell him.
- No, I must meet him.

2049
01:48:04,290 --> 01:48:06,660
I am really busy today,
I've too many chores to finish.

2050
01:48:06,910 --> 01:48:08,870
- I see.
- You go.

2051
01:48:09,120 --> 01:48:11,250
You just spoke my mind.

2052
01:48:11,540 --> 01:48:13,620
We'll do it together.

2053
01:48:13,700 --> 01:48:16,160
- No-no-no...
- I'll help my brother.

2054
01:48:16,290 --> 01:48:18,500
Where do I begin? Here?

2055
01:48:18,700 --> 01:48:19,830
Here...

2056
01:48:21,040 --> 01:48:22,700
Let's make this place shine together.

2057
01:48:23,790 --> 01:48:25,040
Shyam, listen to me.

2058
01:48:25,700 --> 01:48:28,540
He's a busy man,
you'll need an appointment first.

2059
01:48:29,040 --> 01:48:31,620
I'll get an appointment for you...
In fact, I'll bring him to your house.

2060
01:48:31,870 --> 01:48:33,700
- Really?
- Of course.

2061
01:48:34,290 --> 01:48:36,870
- Let me sweep this first.
- Now you go.

2062
01:48:38,290 --> 01:48:41,250
- What are you doing?
- No..no..

2063
01:48:41,370 --> 01:48:42,290
Leave it... leave it.

2064
01:48:42,410 --> 01:48:44,250
I'm cleaning this room,
you go clean the other room.

2065
01:48:44,330 --> 01:48:47,500
No-no-no... I'll do it.
Let go.

2066
01:48:47,700 --> 01:48:49,120
This is my job, and I'll do it.

2067
01:48:49,290 --> 01:48:50,450
You go in the other room,
there are other things to do.

2068
01:48:50,580 --> 01:48:54,080
- No-no-no...
- Let me clean this room.

2069
01:48:54,250 --> 01:48:55,450
Let him do it.

2070
01:48:55,700 --> 01:48:57,000
Everyone wants to clean the same room.

2071
01:48:57,410 --> 01:48:59,580
I'm telling you. Go... go...

2072
01:48:59,700 --> 01:49:00,620
Oh, God.

2073
01:49:00,700 --> 01:49:01,870
Go... go...

2074
01:49:01,950 --> 01:49:06,290
You should have told me
if you wanted to fire me, sir.

2075
01:49:10,950 --> 01:49:12,830
Why are you calling him 'sir'?

2076
01:49:12,910 --> 01:49:13,950
You shut up.

2077
01:49:14,500 --> 01:49:16,370
What else will I call my boss?

2078
01:49:19,580 --> 01:49:21,950
She doesn't know... go.

2079
01:49:22,790 --> 01:49:23,700
Is he...

2080
01:49:24,830 --> 01:49:25,950
your boss?

2081
01:49:26,330 --> 01:49:27,870
Yes, he's the owner of this house.

2082
01:49:29,700 --> 01:49:31,750
Where do they come from?

2083
01:49:34,120 --> 01:49:38,000
Go to the other room.

2084
01:49:45,620 --> 01:49:47,450
Look Shyam...

2085
01:49:49,580 --> 01:49:50,700
You see...

2086
01:49:53,120 --> 01:49:56,250
I lied for the sake of my child.

2087
01:49:59,120 --> 01:49:59,870
Forgive me.

2088
01:50:06,330 --> 01:50:09,000
Politicians steal a poor man's food.

2089
01:50:10,540 --> 01:50:12,540
Builders steal their land.

2090
01:50:14,410 --> 01:50:16,410
We're getting one
opportunity to educate our children...

2091
01:50:16,620 --> 01:50:18,250
but you want to steal that too.

2092
01:50:18,540 --> 01:50:19,410
Why?

2093
01:50:20,750 --> 01:50:24,700
Because if our kids get educated,
and if they speak in English...

2094
01:50:25,330 --> 01:50:27,000
who's going to service to you?

2095
01:50:31,540 --> 01:50:33,950
Look, I didn't think that far.

2096
01:50:35,580 --> 01:50:37,250
I swear...

2097
01:50:39,370 --> 01:50:40,870
I only did it for my child.

2098
01:50:41,500 --> 01:50:43,910
Didn't you feel any
sympathy for my child?

2099
01:50:45,500 --> 01:50:47,080
How dare you take his right?

2100
01:50:49,370 --> 01:50:50,660
And now you're doing charity.

2101
01:50:51,790 --> 01:50:53,660
We don't want charity.

2102
01:50:54,250 --> 01:50:55,910
I want my child's right...

2103
01:50:56,580 --> 01:50:58,580
which you took from him
and gave it to your daughter.

2104
01:51:04,620 --> 01:51:05,660
Okay.

2105
01:51:09,620 --> 01:51:12,290
You did what you thought
was right for your child.

2106
01:51:12,620 --> 01:51:13,950
Yes.

2107
01:51:16,450 --> 01:51:19,370
Now I'll do what's right,
for my child.

2108
01:51:24,410 --> 01:51:25,370
Watch what I will do.

2109
01:51:37,950 --> 01:51:41,450
Raj... if he complains
at Delhi Grammar School...

2110
01:51:41,660 --> 01:51:43,040
- then the police will come for you.
- No, they won't.

2111
01:51:43,120 --> 01:51:45,200
And if they arrest you,
then your life will be ruined.

2112
01:51:45,330 --> 01:51:46,540
Everyone will call
Pia a fraud's daughter.

2113
01:51:46,660 --> 01:51:48,700
And if she gets depressed
and starts doing drugs...

2114
01:51:48,790 --> 01:51:50,540
Stop-stop!

2115
01:51:50,700 --> 01:51:53,500
Why do all your stories
end with Pia doing drugs?

2116
01:51:53,580 --> 01:51:55,660
- Drive carefully.
- I am.

2117
01:51:58,620 --> 01:51:59,580
Coming, Raj.

2118
01:52:01,910 --> 01:52:03,660
I didn't know we
would be running a race.

2119
01:52:05,290 --> 01:52:07,080
Mister... which way is
the principal's office?

2120
01:52:07,200 --> 01:52:09,000
- Take the next left.
- This way?

2121
01:52:11,450 --> 01:52:12,660
Walk in a line, please.

2122
01:52:12,790 --> 01:52:14,080
Shyamu uncle!

2123
01:52:21,330 --> 01:52:24,870
Shyamu uncle, do you like
my new school uniform?

2124
01:52:24,950 --> 01:52:28,660
It's very nice.
You look like an angel.

2125
01:52:28,830 --> 01:52:31,660
Where's Mohan, Shyamu uncle?

2126
01:52:31,870 --> 01:52:33,830
Mohan's right where he always belonged.

2127
01:52:34,290 --> 01:52:35,120
He's better.

2128
01:52:36,540 --> 01:52:39,790
- How are you?
- I am fine, uncle.

2129
01:52:39,950 --> 01:52:40,910
Pia.

2130
01:52:41,330 --> 01:52:42,500
Come back in line.

2131
01:52:42,950 --> 01:52:45,000
Bye, Shyamu uncle.

2132
01:52:47,790 --> 01:52:48,660
Come.

2133
01:52:50,040 --> 01:52:51,200
- Bye.
- Bye.

2134
01:53:24,700 --> 01:53:27,000
Do you know why I can't be like you?

2135
01:53:29,620 --> 01:53:31,950
Because we don't know
how to steal someone's right.

2136
01:53:36,330 --> 01:53:39,250
She's my child too... she
will study here.

2137
01:53:51,410 --> 01:53:51,950
Raj...

2138
01:53:54,700 --> 01:53:56,290
- You're going in the wrong direction.
- Yes.

2139
01:53:56,540 --> 01:53:57,660
We're supposed to go this way.

2140
01:53:59,700 --> 01:54:00,670
Raj, wait.

2141
01:54:00,750 --> 01:54:02,870
Raj... you can't do this.

2142
01:54:03,580 --> 01:54:05,080
I won't let you do this.

2143
01:54:05,410 --> 01:54:07,040
Raj, we did everything
we could for this...

2144
01:54:07,290 --> 01:54:08,660
What did we do, Mita?

2145
01:54:09,700 --> 01:54:11,040
We cheated.

2146
01:54:11,500 --> 01:54:13,620
We stole a poor kid's right.
That's what we did.

2147
01:54:14,620 --> 01:54:19,040
Raj, you've always listened to me,
haven't you?

2148
01:54:19,450 --> 01:54:23,410
For the last time... please,
listen to me... just this once, please.

2149
01:54:23,700 --> 01:54:27,120
Look, Mita, all my life
I've tried to be a good husband.

2150
01:54:27,290 --> 01:54:28,620
I know, Raj...

2151
01:54:29,700 --> 01:54:32,000
But if you're not
a good human being...

2152
01:54:32,700 --> 01:54:34,830
then you can't be a
good husband nor a good father.

2153
01:54:35,080 --> 01:54:37,910
- You can't stop me this time.
- Raj... think about Pia.

2154
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:38,910
Let go.

2155
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:40,750
Think about Pia.

2156
01:54:45,500 --> 01:54:47,500
We're sorry,
madam, for this mistake.

2157
01:54:47,830 --> 01:54:49,830
And now we want
to rectify this mistake.

2158
01:54:50,200 --> 01:54:51,200
You can...

2159
01:54:52,870 --> 01:54:55,450
cancel our daughter's admission.

2160
01:54:58,540 --> 01:55:02,620
Move Pia Batra's form from
RTE to the General category.

2161
01:55:02,750 --> 01:55:03,580
Yes, madam.

2162
01:55:03,660 --> 01:55:05,160
- And get rid of these files.
- Yes.

2163
01:55:07,830 --> 01:55:09,120
What are you doing?

2164
01:55:09,540 --> 01:55:11,950
Helping you out, Mr. Batra.

2165
01:55:12,370 --> 01:55:14,830
No madam, what we did is fraud.

2166
01:55:15,410 --> 01:55:18,790
No... in fact,
you've taken a good initiative.

2167
01:55:19,250 --> 01:55:22,580
- Our school needs parents like you.
- No.. No..

2168
01:55:22,700 --> 01:55:26,370
Madam, this seat belongs to
Shyamprakash's son Mohan.

2169
01:55:26,790 --> 01:55:28,580
Try to understand one thing.

2170
01:55:28,830 --> 01:55:31,410
If I give this seat to a poor kid...

2171
01:55:31,830 --> 01:55:34,370
- how will I benefit from it?
- What?

2172
01:55:34,660 --> 01:55:36,000
You're saying this, madam.

2173
01:55:36,250 --> 01:55:38,540
You were underprivileged...

2174
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:42,000
Yes, go on... no need to hesitate.

2175
01:55:42,700 --> 01:55:44,410
You want to say that...

2176
01:55:44,500 --> 01:55:46,450
I am the daughter
of a poor servant.

2177
01:55:46,830 --> 01:55:48,330
I completely forgot about that.

2178
01:55:48,660 --> 01:55:50,660
Thank you for reminding me.

2179
01:55:53,250 --> 01:55:58,080
I even forgot how
my classmates treated me.

2180
01:55:58,500 --> 01:56:00,790
If I didn't do their homework...

2181
01:56:01,080 --> 01:56:04,330
they wouldn't invite
me to their birthday parties...

2182
01:56:05,950 --> 01:56:07,620
And even if I was invited
to their parties...

2183
01:56:07,750 --> 01:56:10,450
I would sit alone in a corner.

2184
01:56:11,370 --> 01:56:12,790
But now, Mr. Batra...

2185
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:16,790
the same classmates are willing
to do anything for me...

2186
01:56:17,040 --> 01:56:20,040
for the admission
of their children.

2187
01:56:21,620 --> 01:56:25,750
So you want to say... you
won't give Mohan admission.

2188
01:56:25,830 --> 01:56:29,790
Wow... Now you can even
read my thoughts, Mr. Batra.

2189
01:56:34,580 --> 01:56:37,790
Look, madam, this seat
rightfully belongs to Mohan...

2190
01:56:38,450 --> 01:56:41,040
and I'll make sure he gets it.

2191
01:56:42,080 --> 01:56:44,790
And I can go to any lengths for it.

2192
01:56:46,580 --> 01:56:48,620
I am really scared, Mr. Batra.

2193
01:56:49,700 --> 01:56:51,410
Where will you go?

2194
01:56:51,750 --> 01:56:54,790
Press? Politicians? Police?

2195
01:56:55,700 --> 01:56:57,790
But even their kids study here.

2196
01:56:59,830 --> 01:57:02,000
I'll tell you where you can go.

2197
01:57:02,250 --> 01:57:04,000
Go to the auditorium...

2198
01:57:04,080 --> 01:57:07,540
and enjoy the program
like the rest of the parents.

2199
01:57:15,120 --> 01:57:17,120
Children,
what is the first sentence?

2200
01:57:17,370 --> 01:57:19,620
'Vivek is clever.'

2201
01:57:19,750 --> 01:57:20,500
Bravo.

2202
01:57:20,790 --> 01:57:22,580
In this sentence...

2203
01:57:26,950 --> 01:57:29,370
Mister, just a minute...

2204
01:57:33,540 --> 01:57:35,500
Welcome Parents and Children.

2205
01:57:35,830 --> 01:57:38,830
Today you're part of
this great institution...

2206
01:57:38,950 --> 01:57:40,620
Delhi Grammar School.

2207
01:57:40,830 --> 01:57:43,040
Your children will
come here as students...

2208
01:57:43,330 --> 01:57:45,250
but they will leave as leaders.

2209
01:57:45,450 --> 01:57:47,450
So let's begin
today's celebrations...

2210
01:57:47,700 --> 01:57:50,250
with this performance
by our students.

2211
01:57:54,450 --> 01:57:57,080
Where were you, Raj?

2212
01:58:47,120 --> 01:58:49,120
"We'll shine like the sun..."

2213
01:58:49,250 --> 01:58:53,620
"we dream to touch the sky."

2214
01:58:53,830 --> 01:58:56,290
"to touch the sky."

2215
01:58:56,580 --> 01:58:58,790
"We'll gather drop by drop..."

2216
01:58:58,950 --> 01:59:03,160
"and flow away with the sea."

2217
01:59:03,330 --> 01:59:05,450
"Away with the sea."

2218
01:59:05,700 --> 01:59:08,870
"We're here right now..."

2219
01:59:09,160 --> 01:59:11,290
"but we want to go beyond."

2220
01:59:11,580 --> 01:59:14,450
"Don't think we can't."

2221
01:59:15,040 --> 01:59:18,040
"We're determined..."

2222
01:59:18,700 --> 01:59:20,700
"and obsessed too."

2223
01:59:20,870 --> 01:59:22,790
"Say it out loud..."

2224
01:59:23,580 --> 01:59:29,250
"I've one life... and
a hundred desires."

2225
01:59:29,500 --> 01:59:32,500
"I'll fulfill them one by one."

2226
01:59:32,750 --> 01:59:38,750
"I've one life... and
a hundred desires."

2227
01:59:38,830 --> 01:59:41,910
"I'll fulfill them one by one."

2228
01:59:42,080 --> 01:59:48,000
"I've one life... and
a hundred desires."

2229
01:59:48,250 --> 01:59:52,160
"Nothing can stop us now."

2230
01:59:53,450 --> 01:59:55,580
"The night is amazing."

2231
01:59:55,790 --> 01:59:57,950
"Happiness is miles away."

2232
01:59:58,120 --> 02:00:02,540
"My eyes looking for
the light in the dark."

2233
02:00:02,750 --> 02:00:11,160
"Hope is
what... dwells in my heart."

2234
02:00:11,250 --> 02:00:20,450
"I'm not giving up... no
matter what the world says."

2235
02:01:11,750 --> 02:01:13,750
Three cheers for the children.

2236
02:01:13,870 --> 02:01:15,750
- Hip-hip...
- Hurray.

2237
02:01:15,830 --> 02:01:17,700
- Hip-hip...
- Hurray.

2238
02:01:17,830 --> 02:01:19,500
- Hip-hip...
- Hurray.

2239
02:01:19,750 --> 02:01:21,540
And now three cheers
for the children of...

2240
02:01:21,620 --> 02:01:23,250
Bharat Nagar Government School.

2241
02:01:23,500 --> 02:01:24,500
Hip-hip...

2242
02:01:26,620 --> 02:01:27,540
Hip-hip...

2243
02:01:29,500 --> 02:01:31,790
No 'Hurray'?

2244
02:01:33,450 --> 02:01:36,330
Oh, my poor child...

2245
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:38,000
Call security.

2246
02:01:38,830 --> 02:01:40,830
if only you went
to an English school.

2247
02:01:42,040 --> 02:01:43,790
What nonsense. Get down.

2248
02:01:44,120 --> 02:01:46,290
Speak in English, madam Principal.

2249
02:01:46,700 --> 02:01:48,830
I swear I am going
to speak in English today.

2250
02:01:49,250 --> 02:01:52,080
English... English... and only English.

2251
02:01:52,660 --> 02:01:54,080
Because English is India...

2252
02:01:54,160 --> 02:01:55,580
and India is English.

2253
02:01:56,120 --> 02:02:00,700
If a Frenchman or a German speaks wrong
English, we don't have a problem.

2254
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:03,040
But if an Indian
speaks wrong English...

2255
02:02:03,160 --> 02:02:04,870
then he's considered useless.

2256
02:02:05,120 --> 02:02:07,290
Hopeless... no value at all.

2257
02:02:08,500 --> 02:02:11,410
Don't come near me... don't touch me.

2258
02:02:11,700 --> 02:02:13,870
I'll tell my story... let
me tell my complete story.

2259
02:02:14,120 --> 02:02:15,080
Then you can touch me.

2260
02:02:15,830 --> 02:02:18,830
Don't come forward, go back.

2261
02:02:20,540 --> 02:02:23,120
If I reveal my true colors,
I'll beat the crap out of you.

2262
02:02:23,200 --> 02:02:25,160
Get back. Get back.

2263
02:02:32,330 --> 02:02:36,750
All my life I spoke Hindi,
and my wife spoke English.

2264
02:02:37,160 --> 02:02:39,080
There she's
sitting in the back side.

2265
02:02:43,370 --> 02:02:45,500
Mitho, raise your hand up.

2266
02:02:50,700 --> 02:02:51,450
There.

2267
02:02:53,950 --> 02:02:56,620
We've big cars, big homes.

2268
02:02:57,080 --> 02:02:58,950
But our English
vocabulary isn't too great.

2269
02:02:59,790 --> 02:03:01,160
People laugh at us.

2270
02:03:02,370 --> 02:03:03,790
Doesn't make a difference to me.

2271
02:03:04,580 --> 02:03:06,160
But it does to my wife.

2272
02:03:08,500 --> 02:03:09,830
She tried really hard...

2273
02:03:10,080 --> 02:03:14,580
to change my style...
look a little hi-fi, sophisticated.

2274
02:03:17,330 --> 02:03:19,160
But I failed, sweetheart.

2275
02:03:20,620 --> 02:03:22,620
Now don't ask me the
spelling of 'sophisticated'...

2276
02:03:22,700 --> 02:03:24,830
because I don't know.

2277
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:32,750
Parents want to imbibe their
children with their abilities...

2278
02:03:32,830 --> 02:03:33,750
but not their abilities.

2279
02:03:33,830 --> 02:03:36,870
So we thought if she studies in this
school, she will be sophisticated too.

2280
02:03:37,500 --> 02:03:38,790
So we did everything for her.

2281
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:42,000
We pretended to be poor... we
lived in Bharat Nagar society.

2282
02:03:42,120 --> 02:03:46,200
Stealing, fraud,
cheating... everything. Everything.

2283
02:03:47,620 --> 02:03:50,750
And we got admission... through
the underprivileged quota.

2284
02:03:51,830 --> 02:03:53,370
Stealing
the rights of these kids.

2285
02:03:57,750 --> 02:03:59,750
And I thought what right?

2286
02:04:00,830 --> 02:04:02,700
These kids
will study with our kids?

2287
02:04:04,830 --> 02:04:07,500
They will
wear soiled clothes, steal.

2288
02:04:07,620 --> 02:04:10,540
Say cuss words...
Teach our children to fight.

2289
02:04:10,870 --> 02:04:12,700
But these children just proved.

2290
02:04:14,620 --> 02:04:16,870
If these children get
admission in this school...

2291
02:04:19,410 --> 02:04:22,080
then the sky is the limit.

2292
02:04:27,160 --> 02:04:29,700
You're not doing them a
favor by giving them admission.

2293
02:04:30,500 --> 02:04:32,330
In fact,
they are doing you a favor.

2294
02:04:34,410 --> 02:04:37,750
How to stay happy without tabs,
tube... gadgets.

2295
02:04:37,830 --> 02:04:39,700
My daughter
didn't learn that at school.

2296
02:04:41,830 --> 02:04:43,950
Less is more.
Sharing is caring.

2297
02:04:44,080 --> 02:04:45,950
Children are made
to memorize all this...

2298
02:04:46,120 --> 02:04:48,370
but Bharat Nagar taught
us how to stay true to it.

2299
02:04:48,750 --> 02:04:50,750
My daughter
learnt it from this kid.

2300
02:04:51,160 --> 02:04:52,580
We stole his rights.

2301
02:04:53,830 --> 02:04:55,790
But we won't
give them admission here.

2302
02:04:57,250 --> 02:04:58,120
Why?

2303
02:04:59,160 --> 02:05:01,750
Because of parents like
us... who are willing to do fraud.

2304
02:05:06,540 --> 02:05:10,410
And principals like her... who
are ready to steal their opportunity.

2305
02:05:11,450 --> 02:05:14,370
She isn't just a
principal... she is a businesswoman.

2306
02:05:15,950 --> 02:05:19,500
Education isn't what it was,
it's a business now.

2307
02:05:22,620 --> 02:05:25,830
But I won't educate my child
by snatching someone's right.

2308
02:05:29,830 --> 02:05:32,540
She can study anywhere... but
not in this school.

2309
02:05:33,950 --> 02:05:37,370
I'm taking my child
out of this school today.

2310
02:05:43,200 --> 02:05:44,200
Sorry, Mitho.

2311
02:06:10,830 --> 02:06:14,450
Ladies and Gentlemen: I would
like to apologize to all of you...

2312
02:06:14,540 --> 02:06:15,790
for the rantings of this man.

2313
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:16,950
I love you, Raj.

2314
02:06:17,160 --> 02:06:20,000
Let's all focus on
why we've gathered here.

2315
02:06:20,080 --> 02:06:24,080
We're gathered here for the
betterment and future of our children.

2316
02:06:24,830 --> 02:06:29,620
By the way,
you two took a brave decision.

2317
02:06:30,450 --> 02:06:35,790
Sacrificing your daughter's
seat... for a poor kid.

2318
02:06:36,080 --> 02:06:38,080
There are many other schools.
We'll keep trying.

2319
02:06:38,410 --> 02:06:39,750
She will definitely
get in somewhere.

2320
02:06:40,790 --> 02:06:41,790
Why anywhere else?

2321
02:06:44,120 --> 02:06:47,790
- We'll send our daughter to your school.
- What?

2322
02:06:48,040 --> 02:06:51,700
Like you said,
government schools are in a bad shape...

2323
02:06:52,040 --> 02:06:54,120
because no one wants
to send their kids there.

2324
02:06:54,660 --> 02:06:55,200
Yes.

2325
02:06:57,200 --> 02:06:59,290
So we'll send Pia to your school.

2326
02:07:00,790 --> 02:07:02,750
- Go dear.
- Yes...

2327
02:07:02,830 --> 02:07:04,450
Come, dear... come.

2328
02:07:07,080 --> 02:07:08,790
Bye, mama. Bye, papa.

2329
02:07:13,080 --> 02:07:14,410
Bye, dear.

2330
02:07:14,620 --> 02:07:16,410
Bye.

2331
02:07:19,200 --> 02:07:21,750
You decided to send
her to a government school!

2332
02:07:22,120 --> 02:07:24,080
She will turn out to be like me.

2333
02:07:26,160 --> 02:07:28,200
I want Pia to be like you.

2334
02:07:29,580 --> 02:07:31,370
Someone who's confident, sensitive,

2335
02:07:31,580 --> 02:07:32,950
willing to fight for
the rights of others.

2336
02:07:33,120 --> 02:07:36,120
Stop it... I am not used
to listening to praises, Mita.

2337
02:07:36,450 --> 02:07:37,750
Then get used to it.

2338
02:07:39,330 --> 02:07:40,750
And stop calling me Mita.

2339
02:07:40,830 --> 02:07:43,040
- Mitho is fine.
- Come... Mitho.

2340
02:07:45,580 --> 02:07:48,210
"Now whatever you at bae."

2341
02:07:48,290 --> 02:07:50,830
"You can make the whole room stare."

2342
02:07:50,910 --> 02:07:53,160
"But you know that my favourite."

2343
02:07:53,250 --> 02:07:55,410
"Is when you are
rocking that desi swag."

2344
02:07:55,500 --> 02:07:58,040
"Suit suits you."

2345
02:07:58,120 --> 02:08:01,290
"Suit suits you."

2346
02:08:01,370 --> 02:08:03,370
"Suits you.."

2347
02:08:03,450 --> 02:08:06,170
"Suit suits you."

2348
02:08:06,250 --> 02:08:07,950
"You look like a Punjaban."

2349
02:08:08,040 --> 02:08:09,250
"You look very beautiful."

2350
02:08:09,330 --> 02:08:11,250
"You look separate from all."

2351
02:08:11,330 --> 02:08:13,410
"Suit suits you."

2352
02:08:16,660 --> 02:08:18,410
"You look like a Punjaban."

2353
02:08:18,500 --> 02:08:19,750
"You look very beautiful."

2354
02:08:19,830 --> 02:08:21,700
"You look separate from all."

2355
02:08:21,790 --> 02:08:24,120
"Suit suits you."

2356
02:08:24,200 --> 02:08:26,790
"Suit suits you."

2357
02:08:48,330 --> 02:08:52,580
"The sound of your anklet
has caused devastation."

2358
02:08:53,700 --> 02:08:58,080
"Guys are asking from
where has this girl come."

2359
02:08:58,950 --> 02:09:01,450
"The sound of your anklet
has caused devastation.."

2360
02:09:01,540 --> 02:09:04,000
"guys are asking from
where has this girl come."

2361
02:09:04,080 --> 02:09:08,620
"Everyone is falling for you."

2362
02:09:08,700 --> 02:09:11,330
"Suit suits you."

2363
02:09:19,660 --> 02:09:22,170
"Now whatever you at bae."

2364
02:09:22,250 --> 02:09:24,790
"You can make the whole room stare."

2365
02:09:24,870 --> 02:09:27,160
"But you know that my favourite."

2366
02:09:27,250 --> 02:09:30,040
"Is when you are
rocking that desi swag."

2367
02:09:30,250 --> 02:09:31,700
"Ooh your little black dress."

2368
02:09:31,790 --> 02:09:32,870
"It don't do it for me."

2369
02:09:32,950 --> 02:09:34,250
"You know how to impress."

2370
02:09:34,330 --> 02:09:35,700
"Just give it to me."

2371
02:09:35,790 --> 02:09:38,290
"No jeans, no dresses, no tees no."

2372
02:09:38,370 --> 02:09:40,580
"My queen she's in a saree, yeah."

2373
02:09:40,660 --> 02:09:41,870
"Now keep it desi."

2374
02:09:41,950 --> 02:09:43,450
"Like you are in Delhi."

2375
02:09:43,540 --> 02:09:46,000
"You gotta rap the team shotted."

2376
02:09:46,080 --> 02:09:48,160
"I know the flexing mad as me.
You should be checking."

2377
02:09:48,250 --> 02:09:50,370
"Coz, I want to make you my Rani."

2378
02:09:50,450 --> 02:09:51,500
"Rock with me."

2379
02:09:53,410 --> 02:09:54,620
"Hey.."

2380
02:09:56,080 --> 02:09:57,120
"Keep it desi."

2381
02:09:58,660 --> 02:09:59,910
"Queen."

2382
02:10:01,540 --> 02:10:05,790
"When you wear black,
yellow and red suit.."

2383
02:10:06,790 --> 02:10:11,080
"the heart of the
guys slips from the chest."

2384
02:10:12,040 --> 02:10:14,580
"When you wear black,
yellow and red suit.."

2385
02:10:14,660 --> 02:10:16,950
"the heart of the
guys slips from the chest."

2386
02:10:17,040 --> 02:10:21,750
"Guru(THE SINGER) is afraid
to say what's in his heart."

2387
02:10:21,830 --> 02:10:24,120
"Suit suits you."

2388
02:10:24,620 --> 02:10:26,250
"You look like a Punjaban."

2389
02:10:26,330 --> 02:10:27,620
"You look very beautiful."

2390
02:10:27,700 --> 02:10:29,580
"You look separate from all."

2391
02:10:29,660 --> 02:10:31,910
"Suit suits you."

2392
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:33,330
"Hey.."

2393
02:10:34,910 --> 02:10:36,370
"Now keep it desi."

2394
02:10:37,160 --> 02:10:39,000
"Till you feeling that.."

2395
02:10:40,410 --> 02:10:44,580
"That suit, you look so good.."

2396
02:10:47,950 --> 02:10:49,330
"Now keep it desi."
