1
00:00:06,232 --> 00:00:07,857
Sure but Paris is...

2
00:00:09,565 --> 00:00:10,541
hardly practical.

3
00:00:10,565 --> 00:00:13,773
Remember, barely a few weeks ago,
I was unemployed.

4
00:00:15,565 --> 00:00:19,124
It was your call to move
two years ago.

5
00:00:19,148 --> 00:00:22,583
The advantage of Paris
was my parents' apartment.

6
00:00:22,607 --> 00:00:26,416
Mr. & Mrs. Mrabti, the idea was
this is an uncontested divorce.

7
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:29,874
I can sign a contested divorce notice.

8
00:00:29,898 --> 00:00:32,583
We'll revisit the separation agreement

9
00:00:32,607 --> 00:00:34,499
prior to divorce being pronounced.

10
00:00:34,523 --> 00:00:37,749
So I'd stay in the field
of relaxation and harmonization

11
00:00:37,773 --> 00:00:40,541
'cause that's what you loved in me.

12
00:00:40,565 --> 00:00:44,874
My particular skills prompted you
to ask Emmanuelle to hire me.

13
00:00:44,898 --> 00:00:47,708
I didn't leave Montfermeil to move here

14
00:00:47,732 --> 00:00:49,583
to spare the kids long trips

15
00:00:49,607 --> 00:00:52,749
when I was with Didier
in Clichy-sous-Bois.

16
00:00:52,773 --> 00:00:55,083
People change, life changes...

17
00:00:55,107 --> 00:00:57,874
All I know is
you always destroyed everything.

18
00:00:57,898 --> 00:01:01,583
Little by little, bit by bit.
And it's still true now.

19
00:01:01,607 --> 00:01:03,583
I needed you. We needed you.

20
00:01:03,607 --> 00:01:05,874
My time resources are not infinite.

21
00:01:05,898 --> 00:01:06,708
Sorry.

22
00:01:06,732 --> 00:01:08,916
You should've shown me.

23
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:11,624
You always got home late,
obsessing about work.

24
00:01:11,648 --> 00:01:14,273
You always got home exhausted.

25
00:01:21,357 --> 00:01:24,898
May I conclude
you are in agreement or...

26
00:01:45,023 --> 00:01:46,565
No, not the mosque.

27
00:01:58,982 --> 00:02:00,315
You have a nerve.

28
00:02:05,107 --> 00:02:06,232
What are they saying?

29
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,357
Is that all?

30
00:02:29,273 --> 00:02:33,083
So you're way too brutal.
I was sick of taking it back there.

31
00:02:33,107 --> 00:02:35,499
- Anal needs...
- Whoa, take it easy.

32
00:02:35,523 --> 00:02:38,416
According to depositions submitted

33
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,583
by attorneys Hazzizi and Merkache,

34
00:02:40,607 --> 00:02:42,874
I hereby declare you divorced.

35
00:02:42,898 --> 00:02:45,083
Yes, please.

36
00:02:45,107 --> 00:02:46,690
By mutual consent.

37
00:03:49,732 --> 00:03:51,166
Are you really sure...

38
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,815
Isn't tomorrow Shorts Day?

39
00:03:54,148 --> 00:03:55,523
No matter.

40
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:00,291
Would you believe it!

41
00:04:00,315 --> 00:04:03,583
I forgot my lipstick, today of all days.

42
00:04:03,607 --> 00:04:04,857
You want mine?

43
00:04:06,773 --> 00:04:09,315
No, never pearly.
Makes you look stupid.

44
00:04:10,857 --> 00:04:13,666
- Morning, Emmanuelle.
- Morning, Joelle.

45
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:15,374
You're doing your makeup.

46
00:04:15,398 --> 00:04:16,398
Yes.

47
00:04:18,857 --> 00:04:19,857
Yes.

48
00:04:22,398 --> 00:04:24,023
I'll try again later.

49
00:04:26,315 --> 00:04:28,458
Kinda disassembled, Kamel's ex.

50
00:04:28,482 --> 00:04:31,791
As ever, I hope
he knows what he's doing.

51
00:04:31,815 --> 00:04:32,815
Excuse me.

52
00:04:35,857 --> 00:04:36,857
Here.

53
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:39,874
It's...

54
00:04:39,898 --> 00:04:41,874
It's no-transfer.

55
00:04:41,898 --> 00:04:44,083
It's no-transfer?

56
00:04:44,107 --> 00:04:46,690
Yes. When you kiss, no transfer.

57
00:05:19,148 --> 00:05:22,541
WONDERS IN THE SUBURBS

58
00:05:22,565 --> 00:05:24,166
Ladies and gentlemen,

59
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:27,208
fellow citizens and dear colleagues,

60
00:05:27,232 --> 00:05:29,416
I bid you welcome.

61
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,458
On this day
of my investiture in high office,

62
00:05:32,482 --> 00:05:35,958
I commit to reciprocating
Montfermeil's trust in us.

63
00:05:35,982 --> 00:05:37,583
I really start now?

64
00:05:37,607 --> 00:05:39,398
Of course. Right now.

65
00:05:41,273 --> 00:05:45,708
We are an ancient
and wonderful locality,

66
00:05:45,732 --> 00:05:50,666
whose distant 12th-century origins
may have been as a leper colony,

67
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:53,833
but it was here, one dark night,

68
00:05:53,857 --> 00:05:56,499
that Jean Valjean met Cosette

69
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:59,333
when she was fetching water
from the spring.

70
00:05:59,357 --> 00:06:05,124
And here that Jean-Baptiste ClÃ©ment
wrote, during the Commune,

71
00:06:05,148 --> 00:06:12,333
When we sing of the cherry season

72
00:06:12,357 --> 00:06:17,541
And gay nightingale and mockingbirds

73
00:06:17,565 --> 00:06:23,083
will trill in delight

74
00:06:23,107 --> 00:06:28,833
The gals will have wild ideas in mind

75
00:06:28,857 --> 00:06:30,624
The lovers...

76
00:06:30,648 --> 00:06:33,083
A locality, then,

77
00:06:33,107 --> 00:06:36,249
which has faced down every ordeal

78
00:06:36,273 --> 00:06:38,374
and risen to every challenge.

79
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:40,333
Now really? It feels weird.

80
00:06:40,357 --> 00:06:43,208
Now's the time. Why come otherwise?

81
00:06:43,232 --> 00:06:46,208
And it's a great honor for me

82
00:06:46,232 --> 00:06:49,291
to present to you the initial reforms...

83
00:06:49,315 --> 00:06:52,499
- It doesn't make sense now.
- Who cares?

84
00:06:52,523 --> 00:06:53,815
Please, Joelle.

85
00:06:54,982 --> 00:06:56,190
Go ahead.

86
00:07:16,273 --> 00:07:19,208
We will begin, as promised,

87
00:07:19,232 --> 00:07:24,041
by renaming and refreshing
public holidays.

88
00:07:24,065 --> 00:07:27,749
Now, everybody, move inside of yourself.

89
00:07:27,773 --> 00:07:31,874
Be sure to take
the temperature of the day.

90
00:07:31,898 --> 00:07:33,499
Be sure to take the tempo.

91
00:07:33,523 --> 00:07:37,398
Sense exactly
where you are in the space.

92
00:07:43,023 --> 00:07:45,374
On January 21,

93
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:47,583
a date that curiously enough

94
00:07:47,607 --> 00:07:50,666
marks the death
of both Louis XVI and Lenin,

95
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:53,499
we shall celebrate Harem Pants Day.

96
00:07:53,523 --> 00:07:54,565
Breathe in!

97
00:07:56,065 --> 00:07:58,107
And out all the way.

98
00:08:13,273 --> 00:08:16,708
On February 10, we shall not hold
the Carnival of Cultures,

99
00:08:16,732 --> 00:08:19,708
which for budgetary reasons
moves to June 25,

100
00:08:19,732 --> 00:08:22,732
coinciding with Brioche Day.

101
00:08:25,815 --> 00:08:26,898
You may say

102
00:08:28,023 --> 00:08:30,607
that it is strange
to celebrate the brioche,

103
00:08:31,857 --> 00:08:34,958
when many struggle to buy bread.

104
00:08:34,982 --> 00:08:37,940
March 8, we shall celebrate Kilt Day.

105
00:08:40,482 --> 00:08:42,815
No, sorry, the kilt's in June.

106
00:08:50,857 --> 00:08:53,815
No, Ascension Thursday
is replaced by Women's Day.

107
00:08:55,107 --> 00:08:57,357
Like arrows through the brain.

108
00:08:59,398 --> 00:09:02,583
Easter becomes Biodiversity Day.

109
00:09:02,607 --> 00:09:05,232
April 23 shall be Kimono Day.

110
00:09:06,773 --> 00:09:10,541
Finally, and I kept this for the end,

111
00:09:10,565 --> 00:09:12,791
May 12 will be a day

112
00:09:12,815 --> 00:09:15,708
for shorts, to make it clear

113
00:09:15,732 --> 00:09:18,791
that our reforms
are far more than symbolic.

114
00:09:18,815 --> 00:09:20,333
I mention them first

115
00:09:20,357 --> 00:09:22,624
because they are the cornerstone

116
00:09:22,648 --> 00:09:25,791
of our new Policy of Urban Time,

117
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:28,958
which the people of Montfermeil approved

118
00:09:28,982 --> 00:09:32,315
so massively by casting their votes

119
00:09:34,357 --> 00:09:37,065
so massively for us.

120
00:09:39,815 --> 00:09:42,833
Ladies and gentlemen,

121
00:09:42,857 --> 00:09:46,124
I believe in local democracy.

122
00:09:46,148 --> 00:09:48,732
I believe in direct democracy.

123
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:53,065
"Sometime,

124
00:09:54,315 --> 00:09:57,440
"martyr weary of poles and zones

125
00:09:59,273 --> 00:10:02,898
"The sea whose sob softened my rolling

126
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:08,982
"Raised it's shadow-flowers to me
with their yellow disks

127
00:10:10,398 --> 00:10:13,482
"There was I like a woman on her knees

128
00:10:14,857 --> 00:10:17,249
"I was carefree

129
00:10:17,273 --> 00:10:19,666
"and drunk on wonders

130
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:22,416
"Million golden birds

131
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:25,065
"I lived in Montfermeil!"

132
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:50,107
Long live Montfermeil.

133
00:10:51,565 --> 00:10:52,833
Long live France.

134
00:10:52,857 --> 00:10:55,124
Our new Policy of Urban Time

135
00:10:55,148 --> 00:10:58,708
involves reducing working hours,

136
00:10:58,732 --> 00:11:01,107
to be shared
by everyone, for everyone.

137
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:11,999
The aim is twofold,
reducing unemployment

138
00:11:12,023 --> 00:11:16,708
and organizing rest periods
in the course of time.

139
00:11:16,732 --> 00:11:20,148
For example,
our new Naps for All program.

140
00:11:29,815 --> 00:11:31,874
We'll cut unemployment in half

141
00:11:31,898 --> 00:11:36,107
by creating the Montfermeil
International School of Languages.

142
00:11:37,607 --> 00:11:41,333
We are responsible for house calls

143
00:11:41,357 --> 00:11:45,374
with the Sexual Assistance
and Satisfaction Department.

144
00:11:45,398 --> 00:11:46,523
The SASAD.

145
00:11:50,482 --> 00:11:53,541
Our toll-free hotline number is 0865

146
00:11:53,565 --> 00:11:56,333
865 865.

147
00:11:56,357 --> 00:12:00,874
We are all over
the city's streets, every night.

148
00:12:00,898 --> 00:12:03,249
Dysfunctions, shyness...

149
00:12:03,273 --> 00:12:05,482
Misunderstandings, aversions...

150
00:12:09,232 --> 00:12:11,190
So I'll be in charge

151
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,374
of outreach and liaison

152
00:12:15,398 --> 00:12:19,124
between our citizens
and the Roma community.

153
00:12:19,148 --> 00:12:21,023
A kind of crash-course

154
00:12:22,148 --> 00:12:23,791
for our citizens

155
00:12:23,815 --> 00:12:26,107
with the ideas and practices

156
00:12:27,148 --> 00:12:28,315
of the Roma.

157
00:12:46,857 --> 00:12:48,708
Good morning.

158
00:12:48,732 --> 00:12:50,065
It's the Prefect.

159
00:12:51,523 --> 00:12:52,940
That's the Prefect?

160
00:12:54,773 --> 00:12:56,690
What have we here? The police?

161
00:13:02,065 --> 00:13:03,482
Morning, Mr. Prefect.

162
00:13:05,482 --> 00:13:07,124
As I always say,

163
00:13:07,148 --> 00:13:10,357
only great actors
are successful in politics.

164
00:13:11,982 --> 00:13:15,791
And an actress, even better.

165
00:13:15,815 --> 00:13:17,666
A woman who epitomizes jolly.

166
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:19,208
Madame Joly.

167
00:13:19,232 --> 00:13:21,374
Easier on the eye.

168
00:13:21,398 --> 00:13:24,624
I also liked the content of your speech.

169
00:13:24,648 --> 00:13:27,982
Lucky I didn't see you there.
I'd have lost my thread.

170
00:13:30,857 --> 00:13:33,416
With all the disruptions we had.

171
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,749
Just some whiners.

172
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:38,624
Yes, I suppose you could say that.

173
00:13:38,648 --> 00:13:40,916
You'll never lose

174
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:42,583
your thread or...

175
00:13:42,607 --> 00:13:45,166
your powers of persuasion.

176
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:47,732
It makes you so attractive.

177
00:13:52,148 --> 00:13:53,315
You do me good.

178
00:14:01,898 --> 00:14:03,982
You have reached SASAD. Evening.

179
00:14:07,523 --> 00:14:08,607
Hung up.

180
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:19,107
That's Emmanuelle.

181
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:27,166
In the cherry season

182
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:31,249
If you fear a broken heart

183
00:14:31,273 --> 00:14:32,648
Avoid the beauties

184
00:14:35,107 --> 00:14:39,166
Having little fear of life's cruelties

185
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:41,857
I shall not live without suffering

186
00:14:43,398 --> 00:14:44,708
Nailed it.

187
00:14:44,732 --> 00:14:48,583
So we're agreed, human resources
are no different than OISE.

188
00:14:48,607 --> 00:14:49,624
Our model.

189
00:14:49,648 --> 00:14:52,624
Noise? Humans the same as noise?

190
00:14:52,648 --> 00:14:54,148
O.I.S.E...

191
00:14:56,607 --> 00:14:58,499
- Concentrate, Juliette.
- Sorry.

192
00:14:58,523 --> 00:15:01,583
So, the idea is 547 staff members.

193
00:15:01,607 --> 00:15:05,583
We cancel the budget
for surveillance cameras

194
00:15:05,607 --> 00:15:08,791
totaling 2,035,536 euros.

195
00:15:08,815 --> 00:15:12,499
Which leaves us 5,500,000 to find.

196
00:15:12,523 --> 00:15:14,708
And our 547 teachers.

197
00:15:14,732 --> 00:15:17,583
Bring up the price list,

198
00:15:17,607 --> 00:15:18,749
Guillaume.

199
00:15:18,773 --> 00:15:22,166
The average stay for students
in Oxford learning English

200
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:23,791
is two weeks.

201
00:15:23,815 --> 00:15:26,624
And the spend per student
ranges from 3,440 euros

202
00:15:26,648 --> 00:15:30,041
to 5,570 euros.

203
00:15:30,065 --> 00:15:32,124
We said we'd aim for half,

204
00:15:32,148 --> 00:15:34,666
making annual turnover of 15 million.

205
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:36,749
If we don't hit our target right away,

206
00:15:36,773 --> 00:15:40,708
we'll at least hit 5 million
in our second year.

207
00:15:40,732 --> 00:15:43,541
Kamel, where are we at with teachers?

208
00:15:43,565 --> 00:15:47,999
Nowhere. I couldn't reach out to anyone
until we were in office.

209
00:15:48,023 --> 00:15:51,041
Naturally, but surely you did
a feasibility study.

210
00:15:51,065 --> 00:15:53,583
- You're ready?
- No, not ready.

211
00:15:53,607 --> 00:15:56,166
As I told you, Emmanuelle,
several times,

212
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:58,583
we can't begin
with 62 languages to learn.

213
00:15:58,607 --> 00:16:01,249
Year 1, we focus
on languages we agreed.

214
00:16:01,273 --> 00:16:02,624
Arabic, Chinese,

215
00:16:02,648 --> 00:16:04,791
Tamil, Sonikay...

216
00:16:04,815 --> 00:16:06,333
Soninke.

217
00:16:06,357 --> 00:16:08,541
- And Cajun.
- And German.

218
00:16:08,565 --> 00:16:10,416
How come German?

219
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,624
We said I'd contact
the Turkish community

220
00:16:12,648 --> 00:16:14,940
to bring in German Turks
for the project.

221
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,833
Yes, that's right.

222
00:16:19,857 --> 00:16:21,833
So that makes seven.

223
00:16:21,857 --> 00:16:23,982
Anyway, we need double the teachers.

224
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:30,523
Guillaume,
can you bring up the schedule?

225
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:36,291
See, BenoÃ®t?

226
00:16:36,315 --> 00:16:38,398
What about people's naps?

227
00:16:40,773 --> 00:16:43,291
Naps mean doubling teacher numbers

228
00:16:43,315 --> 00:16:45,999
compared to the Brits
for the same number of classes.

229
00:16:46,023 --> 00:16:48,916
- Shit, totally forgot naps.
- So I see.

230
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:52,541
We have 8,433 employees in Montfermeil.

231
00:16:52,565 --> 00:16:55,166
Agreed? 1,290 part-time.

232
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:59,708
Take away anyone who doesn't speak
Chinese, Arabic, Tamil, Soninke, etc.

233
00:16:59,732 --> 00:17:01,708
Nowhere near 547 x 2.

234
00:17:01,732 --> 00:17:04,291
I need 8 people per block

235
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:06,541
for the rooftop arable farms.

236
00:17:06,565 --> 00:17:08,499
Okay on that?

237
00:17:08,523 --> 00:17:10,857
- BenoÃ®t?
- Yes. Fabulous.

238
00:17:12,107 --> 00:17:13,166
Not fabulous.

239
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:15,208
And including the Undesirables?

240
00:17:15,232 --> 00:17:16,958
I didn't find the lists.

241
00:17:16,982 --> 00:17:21,666
"How little time it takes
to change all things."

242
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:24,041
We stumbled across them.

243
00:17:24,065 --> 00:17:25,999
We took care of it, deleted them.

244
00:17:26,023 --> 00:17:29,791
Denis, we said
no destroying LCPD files.

245
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:33,708
We need them to undo
our predecessors' population removal PUR.

246
00:17:33,732 --> 00:17:36,416
Slow down, Kamel. What files?

247
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:40,041
The LCPD's. Local Committee
for Prevention of Delinquency.

248
00:17:40,065 --> 00:17:41,916
PUR. Plan for Urban Renovation.

249
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:45,624
"Thinking we did right,
we must look in our hearts,

250
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:48,124
"which the ice attains,

251
00:17:48,148 --> 00:17:51,523
"as one counts the dead
on a battlefield.

252
00:17:53,607 --> 00:17:57,124
"Each fallen grief,
each extinguished dream."

253
00:17:57,148 --> 00:17:58,291
Talk normally?

254
00:17:58,315 --> 00:18:02,166
He is talking normally.
It's Victor Hugo.

255
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:04,708
Denis, we must bring back
the Undesirables.

256
00:18:04,732 --> 00:18:06,249
How can we find them

257
00:18:06,273 --> 00:18:07,874
without the lists?

258
00:18:07,898 --> 00:18:12,416
Bring them back and house them
in the Greater Paris development.

259
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,648
You must find those people.

260
00:18:54,315 --> 00:18:57,416
BenoÃ®t Survenant,
deputy mayor, eco-solidarity.

261
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,732
Where are your parents?

262
00:19:02,732 --> 00:19:04,232
I'm here, sir.

263
00:19:05,815 --> 00:19:07,791
So, I have been charged,

264
00:19:07,815 --> 00:19:10,749
for purposes of job creation,

265
00:19:10,773 --> 00:19:13,916
with finding people who were...

266
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:18,124
Whom the Plan for Urban Renovation, PUR,

267
00:19:18,148 --> 00:19:19,273
ran out.

268
00:19:20,565 --> 00:19:22,833
And labeled Undesirable.

269
00:19:22,857 --> 00:19:24,333
How would you say it?

270
00:19:24,357 --> 00:19:26,583
Put aside.

271
00:19:26,607 --> 00:19:28,690
- Yes, put aside.
- Undesirable.

272
00:19:31,982 --> 00:19:34,458
One might say ran out.

273
00:19:34,482 --> 00:19:36,624
Yes, I'd...

274
00:19:36,648 --> 00:19:38,357
I'd say ran out.

275
00:19:40,065 --> 00:19:42,916
I see you've lived here a long time.

276
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:45,749
I mean you're settled here.

277
00:19:45,773 --> 00:19:50,065
Perhaps you know somebody
who was run out?

278
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:54,398
Somebody who was...

279
00:19:56,148 --> 00:19:57,232
Who was...

280
00:19:59,232 --> 00:20:00,232
run out?

281
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:03,565
Yes, I do.

282
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:07,083
Where are they?

283
00:20:07,107 --> 00:20:08,749
They're everywhere.

284
00:20:08,773 --> 00:20:10,124
Meaning?

285
00:20:10,148 --> 00:20:11,565
I am one.

286
00:20:15,398 --> 00:20:17,333
How come?

287
00:20:17,357 --> 00:20:19,190
How come? Because...

288
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:22,666
Because I...

289
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:25,357
I don't fit anymore, simple as that.

290
00:20:27,148 --> 00:20:28,874
Do you have a job?

291
00:20:28,898 --> 00:20:30,499
I lost my job.

292
00:20:30,523 --> 00:20:32,732
I don't know what to expect.

293
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:35,541
This is something

294
00:20:35,565 --> 00:20:39,440
that can really be resolved.

295
00:20:40,815 --> 00:20:42,065
We hope so.

296
00:20:43,773 --> 00:20:46,458
In any case,
with Ms. Joly, that's our goal.

297
00:20:46,482 --> 00:20:49,916
Did you arrive in France
with your daughters?

298
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:51,666
No.

299
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:52,999
I had them here.

300
00:20:53,023 --> 00:20:55,374
I come to France at 19.

301
00:20:55,398 --> 00:20:56,541
I see.

302
00:20:56,565 --> 00:20:58,583
Came here at 19.

303
00:20:58,607 --> 00:21:01,041
And you're French?

304
00:21:01,065 --> 00:21:04,666
- I mean you have nationality.
- For 25-26 years.

305
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:06,916
- And the gentleman?
- Ibrahim.

306
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:09,291
You know people who were run out?

307
00:21:09,315 --> 00:21:11,583
Of course, I do.

308
00:21:11,607 --> 00:21:12,916
Where are they?

309
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:14,249
I don't know.

310
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:16,124
Can we find them?

311
00:21:16,148 --> 00:21:17,940
There's Abdullah.

312
00:21:21,065 --> 00:21:23,083
There's Saleh.

313
00:21:23,107 --> 00:21:25,708
You have their family names too?

314
00:21:25,732 --> 00:21:28,416
I don't really know family names.

315
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,982
I know them because they're local...

316
00:21:32,273 --> 00:21:33,749
Ladies?

317
00:21:33,773 --> 00:21:35,041
What about you?

318
00:21:35,065 --> 00:21:36,708
Adham.

319
00:21:36,732 --> 00:21:38,333
Adham and Awa.

320
00:21:38,357 --> 00:21:39,999
At school, for example?

321
00:21:40,023 --> 00:21:42,249
No, don't know any.

322
00:21:42,273 --> 00:21:44,916
In one way, that's pretty fabulous.

323
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:46,273
It's fabulous.

324
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:49,916
I'll make tracks.

325
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:51,565
BenoÃ®t Survenant.

326
00:21:52,607 --> 00:21:55,166
- Isn't that right?
- A pleasure.

327
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:58,749
If ever anyone comes to mind...

328
00:21:58,773 --> 00:22:00,916
These people who were run out,

329
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:02,666
you understand,

330
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:03,690
are now...

331
00:22:04,815 --> 00:22:05,857
Ma'am...

332
00:22:08,815 --> 00:22:12,124
They are now people
that are badly wanted.

333
00:22:12,148 --> 00:22:14,999
My wife and I like DETI.

334
00:22:15,023 --> 00:22:17,999
Because we have more time.

335
00:22:18,023 --> 00:22:21,916
At the job center,
there's no time, lots of people.

336
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:25,958
We just get 10-15 minutes
with regards to the jobs we're looking for.

337
00:22:25,982 --> 00:22:30,833
As regards photocopies, documents,
signing up, signing off.

338
00:22:30,857 --> 00:22:31,999
It takes time,

339
00:22:32,023 --> 00:22:34,732
and there's lots of people and no time.

340
00:22:38,565 --> 00:22:42,083
We're still the same DETI.

341
00:22:42,107 --> 00:22:44,874
Department of Employment,
Training and Integration,

342
00:22:44,898 --> 00:22:46,148
now named TUTU.

343
00:22:47,232 --> 00:22:49,940
The Urban Time Unit. It's not...

344
00:22:52,565 --> 00:22:54,499
Mr. Brakhni,

345
00:22:54,523 --> 00:22:57,791
the philosophy of our new team
is quite specifically

346
00:22:57,815 --> 00:23:02,232
to take our time with you.
An hour, if not more. Alright?

347
00:23:03,482 --> 00:23:05,458
Actually, I work...

348
00:23:05,482 --> 00:23:08,749
I don't work in town, I work outside.

349
00:23:08,773 --> 00:23:10,398
In the Paris region.

350
00:23:11,732 --> 00:23:14,666
I get by with mass transit.
I get by just fine.

351
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:16,107
Today, it's about my wife.

352
00:23:18,982 --> 00:23:20,624
Mrs. Brakhni...

353
00:23:20,648 --> 00:23:22,499
- Good morning.
- Morning, ma'am.

354
00:23:22,523 --> 00:23:23,624
Do you...

355
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:24,898
What are your skills?

356
00:23:27,523 --> 00:23:28,523
Cleaning.

357
00:23:29,815 --> 00:23:32,291
I'd like to...

358
00:23:32,315 --> 00:23:36,666
work with children in a school.

359
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:38,083
I didn't find anything.

360
00:23:38,107 --> 00:23:40,083
You read and write French?

361
00:23:40,107 --> 00:23:41,458
A bit.

362
00:23:41,482 --> 00:23:44,499
- Reading and writing?
- A bit.

363
00:23:44,523 --> 00:23:46,773
A little bit.
Read and write a bit.

364
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:58,958
We're going to open a school
here in Montfermeil.

365
00:23:58,982 --> 00:24:00,648
A language school.

366
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:04,458
We could perhaps offer you

367
00:24:04,482 --> 00:24:08,357
a job as a pronunciation coach
in Arabic classes.

368
00:24:09,523 --> 00:24:13,041
That's not bad.
It would be here, at Cedar House.

369
00:24:13,065 --> 00:24:16,499
And that would also enable you...

370
00:24:16,523 --> 00:24:19,499
to tutor people while they commute.

371
00:24:19,523 --> 00:24:21,666
You'll get to know Paris and the sites.

372
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:23,083
I like traveling.

373
00:24:23,107 --> 00:24:24,749
So, it's perfect.

374
00:24:24,773 --> 00:24:27,708
Think about my offer,
talk it over with the family,

375
00:24:27,732 --> 00:24:29,607
and we'll meet again in...

376
00:24:33,357 --> 00:24:34,499
A week.

377
00:24:34,523 --> 00:24:36,416
A week sounds okay?

378
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,065
Yes, sounds great.

379
00:24:39,607 --> 00:24:41,916
- Who's that?
- My girlfriend.

380
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:44,499
- You're kidding?
- We're getting married.

381
00:24:44,523 --> 00:24:47,583
C'mon, if you have no life,
have it on Second Life.

382
00:24:47,607 --> 00:24:49,333
Second Life is so outdated.

383
00:24:49,357 --> 00:24:51,773
- Nobody uses it anymore.
- She does.

384
00:24:53,523 --> 00:24:55,916
Look, that's where we met.

385
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:57,107
We chatted.

386
00:24:58,148 --> 00:24:59,773
We went on quests together.

387
00:25:01,898 --> 00:25:03,398
I brought some tea.

388
00:25:04,732 --> 00:25:05,732
Thank you.

389
00:25:11,023 --> 00:25:12,107
The tea.

390
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:16,208
It was a good investiture.

391
00:25:16,232 --> 00:25:18,565
Yes, Emmanuelle,
a very good investiture.

392
00:25:19,773 --> 00:25:24,124
I was right to insist on singingThe Cherry Season.

393
00:25:24,148 --> 00:25:26,249
Yes, Emmanuelle, you were right to...

394
00:25:26,273 --> 00:25:30,041
What was that poem?
Surely not your own?

395
00:25:30,065 --> 00:25:31,458
Half and half.

396
00:25:31,482 --> 00:25:33,249
What does that mean?

397
00:25:33,273 --> 00:25:34,898
Half-Rimbaud, half-me.

398
00:25:36,398 --> 00:25:39,065
No, she can't do that here.

399
00:25:40,273 --> 00:25:41,482
I've got it.

400
00:25:46,982 --> 00:25:50,749
And pull on the water's surface.

401
00:25:50,773 --> 00:25:54,499
To raise your heads out of the water.

402
00:25:54,523 --> 00:25:57,083
Tell me what I do that works.

403
00:25:57,107 --> 00:25:58,482
And what doesn't work.

404
00:25:59,982 --> 00:26:01,898
And then back again.

405
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:06,690
And we unfurl our wings. Six times.

406
00:26:07,815 --> 00:26:09,374
Aren't you fetching the kids?

407
00:26:09,398 --> 00:26:11,607
Sure. The lobby may not be the place...

408
00:26:17,315 --> 00:26:20,523
It may not be the best place to do this.

409
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:24,523
With both hands.

410
00:26:26,607 --> 00:26:28,374
"It's 59 minutes past.

411
00:26:28,398 --> 00:26:30,124
"One minute to go.

412
00:26:30,148 --> 00:26:31,958
"In your administration,

413
00:26:31,982 --> 00:26:34,940
"maybe not everyone on the team
is playing ball.

414
00:26:36,773 --> 00:26:38,607
"Someone who's here to help."

415
00:26:42,815 --> 00:26:44,791
- You're going?
- Just changing.

416
00:26:44,815 --> 00:26:46,607
Take a look at this a second.

417
00:26:50,023 --> 00:26:52,374
There are some wackjobs.

418
00:26:52,398 --> 00:26:53,732
People are nuts.

419
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,041
Know what?

420
00:27:04,065 --> 00:27:07,107
I'm learning to speak Soninke.

421
00:27:09,232 --> 00:27:11,749
- But by the time...
- To go on missions.

422
00:27:11,773 --> 00:27:15,541
By the time you learn Soninke,
you'll still be with the guy?

423
00:27:15,565 --> 00:27:17,690
I don't know. Who cares!

424
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,999
You are so right.

425
00:27:22,023 --> 00:27:23,107
Who cares!

426
00:27:25,648 --> 00:27:27,232
What on earth is that?

427
00:27:30,107 --> 00:27:34,166
We voted for mostly housing
on Station Plaza.

428
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:35,940
Not for offices.

429
00:27:45,023 --> 00:27:46,982
I need you to help me, Marylin.

430
00:27:51,023 --> 00:27:52,648
My life bores me.

431
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,416
The humor's gone.

432
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:59,041
Don't exaggerate now.

433
00:27:59,065 --> 00:28:00,357
Look at me.

434
00:28:02,065 --> 00:28:03,065
What?

435
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:07,398
I'm disguised as a Mexican wrestler.

436
00:28:18,607 --> 00:28:20,315
Come over here.

437
00:28:23,607 --> 00:28:25,815
No, I don't feel like it.

438
00:28:28,357 --> 00:28:31,232
When you're like this, it turns me off.

439
00:29:30,225 --> 00:29:31,433
I am

440
00:29:32,975 --> 00:29:35,284
deputy

441
00:29:35,308 --> 00:29:38,492
mayor of Montfermeil,

442
00:29:38,516 --> 00:29:39,933
with responsibility

443
00:29:41,475 --> 00:29:42,992
for the Bureau

444
00:29:43,016 --> 00:29:46,266
of Comings and Goings.

445
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:56,725
Okay.

446
00:29:57,808 --> 00:29:59,701
You're taking me

447
00:29:59,725 --> 00:30:01,266
for an

448
00:30:02,683 --> 00:30:04,201
idiot.

449
00:30:04,225 --> 00:30:06,159
An idiot.

450
00:30:06,183 --> 00:30:07,784
You are a hostess

451
00:30:07,808 --> 00:30:09,992
with OFFII,

452
00:30:10,016 --> 00:30:11,350
disguised

453
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,159
as a deputy mayor!

454
00:30:14,183 --> 00:30:15,201
I come

455
00:30:15,225 --> 00:30:18,016
from City Hall in Montfermeil.

456
00:30:20,225 --> 00:30:21,284
Very good.

457
00:30:21,308 --> 00:30:23,534
And you don't work

458
00:30:23,558 --> 00:30:24,933
for OFFII?

459
00:30:26,183 --> 00:30:28,326
Yes? Is that right?

460
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:30,367
The Office for Immigration

461
00:30:30,391 --> 00:30:32,617
and Integration?

462
00:30:32,641 --> 00:30:35,242
Immigration and Integration?

463
00:30:35,266 --> 00:30:36,742
You know?

464
00:30:36,766 --> 00:30:38,534
Are you really

465
00:30:38,558 --> 00:30:41,242
an official with a mandate

466
00:30:41,266 --> 00:30:43,600
from City Hall? Really?

467
00:30:44,683 --> 00:30:48,076
Or are you talking out of your behind?

468
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,076
Dad.

469
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:50,534
Eat.

470
00:30:50,558 --> 00:30:53,159
I would really like

471
00:30:53,183 --> 00:30:56,951
to organize a kind of trip.

472
00:30:56,975 --> 00:31:00,784
It would involve taking people

473
00:31:00,808 --> 00:31:04,034
in your wagons from Montfermeil

474
00:31:04,058 --> 00:31:07,475
to the Apuseni mountains
in Transylvania.

475
00:31:10,016 --> 00:31:11,451
In our wagons?

476
00:31:11,475 --> 00:31:13,742
Seriously? Wagons?

477
00:31:13,766 --> 00:31:15,891
Really? Wagons?

478
00:31:19,766 --> 00:31:21,867
What is this

479
00:31:21,891 --> 00:31:23,433
bullshit idea?

480
00:31:30,058 --> 00:31:32,117
Mr. Sandor,

481
00:31:32,141 --> 00:31:33,909
hear me out.

482
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:36,534
The Municipal Police

483
00:31:36,558 --> 00:31:38,659
was created by our predecessors.

484
00:31:38,683 --> 00:31:41,326
Basically, we intended

485
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:44,034
to disband it. However,

486
00:31:44,058 --> 00:31:47,076
I'll convince Madam Mayor

487
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:49,076
to give them instructions

488
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:52,826
to redeploy

489
00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:54,784
as cemetery guards

490
00:31:54,808 --> 00:31:56,201
so they can stop

491
00:31:56,225 --> 00:31:58,576
the National Police force

492
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:02,076
from drilling holes in your faucets.

493
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:04,492
Alright then, you want

494
00:32:04,516 --> 00:32:06,558
civil war!

495
00:32:09,308 --> 00:32:11,659
What was Latin class about, kitten?

496
00:32:11,683 --> 00:32:12,867
Orders and commands.

497
00:32:12,891 --> 00:32:14,284
Let me take this book?

498
00:32:14,308 --> 00:32:16,284
Hunc librum capem.

499
00:32:16,308 --> 00:32:17,992
Capem?

500
00:32:18,016 --> 00:32:19,742
Is that the subjunctive?

501
00:32:19,766 --> 00:32:20,933
Capiam.

502
00:32:26,766 --> 00:32:28,701
Let them take the book?

503
00:32:28,725 --> 00:32:30,492
Capiunt?

504
00:32:30,516 --> 00:32:31,826
What?

505
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:33,100
I don't know.

506
00:32:34,891 --> 00:32:37,391
Just as I thought, you're lying to me.

507
00:32:38,558 --> 00:32:40,159
I'm not lying to you.

508
00:32:40,183 --> 00:32:43,475
So why did you get it wrong? Liar!

509
00:32:46,558 --> 00:32:48,742
- I'm not lying.
- Are!

510
00:32:48,766 --> 00:32:50,701
You're lying to me! You liar!

511
00:32:50,725 --> 00:32:52,933
I cannot stand you lying to me!

512
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:57,159
Be quiet! Quiet!

513
00:32:57,183 --> 00:32:58,933
- Mom, listen...
- Quiet!

514
00:33:01,975 --> 00:33:05,391
When you go to a crap school,
you work properly.

515
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:11,117
Twenty years, we waited
for a liberal mayor in this town.

516
00:33:11,141 --> 00:33:14,034
The day we get to work at last,
you pull this.

517
00:33:14,058 --> 00:33:17,159
It's a disgrace!

518
00:33:17,183 --> 00:33:18,725
A disgrace!

519
00:33:29,058 --> 00:33:30,909
That doesn't tell me

520
00:33:30,933 --> 00:33:33,367
where to look for

521
00:33:33,391 --> 00:33:36,391
information
on the Greater Paris pilot company.

522
00:33:37,725 --> 00:33:39,992
Is it at...

523
00:33:40,016 --> 00:33:43,100
regional or national level
that I can find out?

524
00:34:32,475 --> 00:34:34,242
Let's recap.

525
00:34:34,266 --> 00:34:36,409
"I'm in a gang, but I have religion.

526
00:34:36,433 --> 00:34:39,492
"I want to leave it
and live an honest life.

527
00:34:39,516 --> 00:34:43,034
"Do nothing more than we ask.

528
00:34:43,058 --> 00:34:45,284
"If you change the plan,
they'll suspect.

529
00:34:45,308 --> 00:34:48,659
"And it'll be
barapandaramonium."

530
00:34:48,683 --> 00:34:51,784
Sign "Someone who's here to help"
as usual.

531
00:34:51,808 --> 00:34:53,242
As usual.

532
00:34:53,266 --> 00:34:54,433
Good job.

533
00:35:54,016 --> 00:35:56,034
How brutal is hope!

534
00:35:56,058 --> 00:35:58,766
What the heck is that?

535
00:36:02,683 --> 00:36:04,641
A new Greater Paris Express station

536
00:36:22,391 --> 00:36:24,576
What does that mean, children?

537
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,409
Hold on. Mohammed?

538
00:36:26,433 --> 00:36:29,826
It means it's a girl speaking.

539
00:36:29,850 --> 00:36:33,367
But what does it mean?
"I am" or "I exist."

540
00:36:33,391 --> 00:36:34,284
Stanley?

541
00:36:34,308 --> 00:36:36,016
How would a boy say it?

542
00:36:37,433 --> 00:36:38,433
Ormance?

543
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:49,367
You're kind of halfway, look.

544
00:36:49,391 --> 00:36:50,391
1, 2, 3...

545
00:36:58,808 --> 00:36:59,992
Hands up!

546
00:37:00,016 --> 00:37:01,034
Move back.

547
00:37:01,058 --> 00:37:02,659
Am I...

548
00:37:02,683 --> 00:37:03,808
Or...

549
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:08,992
I'm hungry.

550
00:37:09,016 --> 00:37:10,451
Hungry!

551
00:37:10,475 --> 00:37:13,225
Like in German.
Pronounce it like it's German.

552
00:37:19,141 --> 00:37:22,701
We had nothing for lunch,
so I'm hungry.

553
00:37:22,725 --> 00:37:24,742
I skipped lunch, so I'm hungry.

554
00:37:24,766 --> 00:37:26,534
There you go.

555
00:37:26,558 --> 00:37:27,617
I'm tired.

556
00:37:27,641 --> 00:37:29,367
It's like a...

557
00:37:29,391 --> 00:37:32,225
That means I'm tired, I'm beat.

558
00:37:37,891 --> 00:37:38,933
You've got it.

559
00:37:40,016 --> 00:37:41,350
How are the children?

560
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:50,766
How are the people from our village?

561
00:37:54,016 --> 00:37:58,617
The rolled 'r'
has to be really discreet and deep.

562
00:37:58,641 --> 00:38:00,701
I'm not discreet enough.

563
00:38:00,725 --> 00:38:03,742
Alright, I know I sing out of tune.

564
00:38:03,766 --> 00:38:04,975
How are the children?

565
00:38:08,141 --> 00:38:10,367
I could not afford to...

566
00:38:10,391 --> 00:38:12,742
To live there with the children.

567
00:38:12,766 --> 00:38:15,016
It was really hard and dull.

568
00:38:16,725 --> 00:38:18,576
That's very complicated.

569
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,742
The plane is up there.

570
00:38:20,766 --> 00:38:23,183
That's how you say "a plane."

571
00:38:24,516 --> 00:38:27,808
Look, the plane is in the sky.

572
00:38:35,725 --> 00:38:37,850
An explosion in the darkness!

573
00:38:41,850 --> 00:38:44,576
There she is.

574
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,451
The fox is me.

575
00:38:46,475 --> 00:38:47,891
The leopardess is her.

576
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:51,933
Gonna send a quick IM.

577
00:38:55,808 --> 00:38:58,683
How about we meet up
in real life, little pearl?

578
00:39:02,225 --> 00:39:04,350
What's with all these offices?

579
00:39:07,016 --> 00:39:10,516
"Windows onto a life of beauty"?

580
00:39:20,016 --> 00:39:21,683
I maybe went too far.

581
00:39:23,141 --> 00:39:24,992
I bet she's looking good.

582
00:39:25,016 --> 00:39:26,659
As good as me, I hope.

583
00:39:26,683 --> 00:39:28,451
Who?

584
00:39:28,475 --> 00:39:29,558
I want a nice girl.

585
00:39:31,225 --> 00:39:32,409
A leopardess maybe.

586
00:39:32,433 --> 00:39:35,350
Let me show you
how we're lobbying the Prefect.

587
00:39:39,933 --> 00:39:43,516
Paris is changing
but none of our energy has flagged

588
00:39:45,558 --> 00:39:47,951
My brand of feminism

589
00:39:47,975 --> 00:39:52,308
involves putting myself
systematically in the center.

590
00:39:54,391 --> 00:39:56,141
Pretend I'm not here.

591
00:40:00,183 --> 00:40:02,183
On June 12, she has invited me

592
00:40:04,475 --> 00:40:06,534
to Bobigny Theatre, to see a show.

593
00:40:06,558 --> 00:40:08,100
Dance Taped.

594
00:40:09,266 --> 00:40:11,117
Dance Taped.

595
00:40:11,141 --> 00:40:14,159
June 12, the theatre,
isn't that tomorrow?

596
00:40:14,183 --> 00:40:16,367
It truly terrifies me.

597
00:40:16,391 --> 00:40:17,534
You're not mad, are you?

598
00:40:17,558 --> 00:40:19,701
Of course I'm not mad at you.

599
00:40:19,725 --> 00:40:22,117
- It's not my fault.
- I know it's not.

600
00:40:22,141 --> 00:40:24,867
I had no choice
but to leave with the Minister.

601
00:40:24,891 --> 00:40:28,367
It's why I left.
I tried to catch your eye.

602
00:40:28,391 --> 00:40:31,534
To give you a kiss from afar
with my eyes.

603
00:40:31,558 --> 00:40:34,867
Paul, I see offices everywhere,
and no housing.

604
00:40:34,891 --> 00:40:37,159
- The document...
- Baby, I read it.

605
00:40:37,183 --> 00:40:41,617
It sums up the argument for offices
and against housing, and vice-versa.

606
00:40:41,641 --> 00:40:45,326
It contains no new data
through lack of access to info

607
00:40:45,350 --> 00:40:47,701
that is crucial and remains unclear.

608
00:40:47,725 --> 00:40:49,909
Look at the Prefecture's conclusions

609
00:40:49,933 --> 00:40:52,534
instead of whining straight off the bat.

610
00:40:52,558 --> 00:40:55,284
Where exactly did I whine?

611
00:40:55,308 --> 00:40:58,617
If you cannot give me
this crucial information,

612
00:40:58,641 --> 00:40:59,951
when I feel like I'm...

613
00:40:59,975 --> 00:41:01,701
You feel like you're what?

614
00:41:01,725 --> 00:41:03,826
I really must scoot.

615
00:41:03,850 --> 00:41:06,225
Am I what? Capable of what?

616
00:41:09,725 --> 00:41:13,409
Of giving me information that is crucial

617
00:41:13,433 --> 00:41:17,117
when I feel I'm getting royally fucked
by two next-door mayors.

618
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:20,683
Getting what? I didn't catch it...

619
00:41:37,933 --> 00:41:39,308
A cause for pride, no?

620
00:41:41,766 --> 00:41:43,826
You see, Emmanuelle, attendance

621
00:41:43,850 --> 00:41:45,992
at Medici is even more fabulous,

622
00:41:46,016 --> 00:41:48,201
so Arabic classes have moved here.

623
00:41:48,225 --> 00:41:50,058
But we cannot go on like this.

624
00:41:56,183 --> 00:41:58,242
They learn one language.

625
00:41:58,266 --> 00:42:01,826
Then another and another.

626
00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:04,826
So, you see,
we need to open up outposts.

627
00:42:04,850 --> 00:42:06,784
I wonder if it's better...

628
00:42:06,808 --> 00:42:09,367
I don't know where to turn, ma'am.

629
00:42:09,391 --> 00:42:12,117
Children today just won't listen.

630
00:42:12,141 --> 00:42:14,951
They don't want to work at school.

631
00:42:14,975 --> 00:42:16,409
I'm tired.

632
00:42:16,433 --> 00:42:18,617
I'm so tired.

633
00:42:18,641 --> 00:42:20,992
I'm absolutely exhausted.

634
00:42:21,016 --> 00:42:22,766
I feel like killing myself.

635
00:42:24,391 --> 00:42:25,617
Kamel, fabulous.

636
00:42:25,641 --> 00:42:27,784
Selim, fabulous you could make it.

637
00:42:27,808 --> 00:42:29,225
Yes, fabulous.

638
00:42:34,725 --> 00:42:36,742
We reviewed the situation.

639
00:42:36,766 --> 00:42:39,367
It's fabulous, but we need new outposts.

640
00:42:39,391 --> 00:42:41,159
And to recruit team leaders

641
00:42:41,183 --> 00:42:43,742
and deputy team leaders.

642
00:42:43,766 --> 00:42:46,242
Just one tiny second...

643
00:42:46,266 --> 00:42:49,766
After you arrive late,
how much time do you need to engage?

644
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:54,617
Talking of time, take out your planners.

645
00:42:54,641 --> 00:42:57,409
Friday June 12, at 7 pm,

646
00:42:57,433 --> 00:43:00,909
on the evening news,
Culture Minister FrÃ©dÃ©ric Chaban

647
00:43:00,933 --> 00:43:03,016
will announce the Medici redevelopment.

648
00:43:04,266 --> 00:43:06,701
I want the whole team present.

649
00:43:06,725 --> 00:43:09,266
Naturally, Emmanuelle.
We'll all be there.

650
00:43:10,433 --> 00:43:12,034
On Friday June 12,

651
00:43:12,058 --> 00:43:14,617
"Rome ousts Sparta."

652
00:43:14,641 --> 00:43:16,659
June 12?

653
00:43:16,683 --> 00:43:18,350
Friday June 12?

654
00:43:20,391 --> 00:43:23,326
What's with the preppy look?

655
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:24,534
A skirt?

656
00:43:24,558 --> 00:43:27,100
What the hell? A twinset?

657
00:43:28,641 --> 00:43:30,576
It's sexy, isn't it?

658
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:34,909
Whereas neither BÃ©atrice, nor myself,

659
00:43:34,933 --> 00:43:38,992
nor anyone else here
has particularly noticed

660
00:43:39,016 --> 00:43:40,742
that anyone

661
00:43:40,766 --> 00:43:44,909
has gone over the top
with compliments on your sportswear.

662
00:43:44,933 --> 00:43:45,909
Am I wrong?

663
00:43:45,933 --> 00:43:48,076
- No.
- Doesn't look great.

664
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:50,492
What I wear is none of your business.

665
00:43:50,516 --> 00:43:52,117
Emmanuelle said it was.

666
00:43:52,141 --> 00:43:55,367
Sorry, I forgot
I take my orders from you.

667
00:43:55,391 --> 00:43:57,183
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

668
00:43:58,308 --> 00:44:02,100
From now on, I'll call every morning
with my wardrobe choices.

669
00:44:03,225 --> 00:44:04,659
And in the fall,

670
00:44:04,683 --> 00:44:06,117
my comrades and I

671
00:44:06,141 --> 00:44:07,492
will send our tailor...

672
00:44:07,516 --> 00:44:10,992
I don't give a shit about your duds.
Not one shit!

673
00:44:11,016 --> 00:44:13,076
But I have enough worries,

674
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:16,951
and your trinkets and pearls
can only mean trouble.

675
00:44:16,975 --> 00:44:19,826
I work here as hard
and as well as anyone.

676
00:44:19,850 --> 00:44:21,409
I run 25 workshops.

677
00:44:21,433 --> 00:44:23,409
- You told Emmanuelle?
- I did.

678
00:44:23,433 --> 00:44:26,492
- And she said?
- "Tell her, no more uptown girl."

679
00:44:26,516 --> 00:44:27,516
Fine.

680
00:44:29,975 --> 00:44:31,391
- That way?
- Yes.

681
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:39,284
- Isn't this outfit just great?
- Mine?

682
00:44:39,308 --> 00:44:41,951
No, mine.
Yours is great, but mine?

683
00:44:41,975 --> 00:44:44,409
- It's super sexy.
- You think?

684
00:44:44,433 --> 00:44:46,891
I absolutely love disguises.

685
00:45:35,725 --> 00:45:38,534
Your cry from the heart today:

686
00:45:38,558 --> 00:45:40,409
No, not them too!

687
00:45:40,433 --> 00:45:41,975
Not my own friends!

688
00:45:43,391 --> 00:45:47,016
Have you heard of the website
poumapi.com?

689
00:45:48,391 --> 00:45:49,391
No.

690
00:45:50,516 --> 00:45:52,933
Is the crew pulling
in the same direction?

691
00:45:54,266 --> 00:45:56,183
Someone who's here to help.

692
00:46:02,850 --> 00:46:03,617
There.

693
00:46:03,641 --> 00:46:04,850
It'll hold.

694
00:47:34,850 --> 00:47:35,891
Marylin?

695
00:47:37,641 --> 00:47:38,451
Yes?

696
00:47:38,475 --> 00:47:40,641
Could you face the mirror?

697
00:47:52,808 --> 00:47:55,141
She's stunning like that, isn't she?

698
00:47:58,100 --> 00:48:00,034
Yes, she's very beautiful.

699
00:48:00,058 --> 00:48:03,100
But I wish we could make love
without disguises.

700
00:48:04,308 --> 00:48:06,308
Relying only on our tenderness.

701
00:48:09,558 --> 00:48:11,701
That's understandable.

702
00:48:11,725 --> 00:48:13,576
Isn't it, Marylin?

703
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:17,850
Sure, but sometimes our tenderness
doesn't seem to consist of much.

704
00:48:21,683 --> 00:48:23,433
We'll go nice and slow.

705
00:48:24,475 --> 00:48:25,808
Nice and slow.

706
00:48:29,433 --> 00:48:30,516
Maybe...

707
00:48:32,058 --> 00:48:34,100
you want to simply disrobe her.

708
00:48:36,058 --> 00:48:38,451
Maybe you simply remove her robe,

709
00:48:38,475 --> 00:48:40,058
and that's just wonderful.

710
00:48:50,725 --> 00:48:53,558
Maybe it matters little
what you remove.

711
00:48:54,725 --> 00:48:57,451
Nice and slow, that's it.

712
00:48:57,475 --> 00:48:59,016
Her shoulders...

713
00:49:04,266 --> 00:49:08,058
Maybe leave her wig on for now.

714
00:49:12,683 --> 00:49:15,409
Turn her around slightly.

715
00:49:15,433 --> 00:49:16,475
Maybe.

716
00:49:29,808 --> 00:49:33,558
The most beautiful back
in the whole Paris region.

717
00:49:35,391 --> 00:49:37,141
Nice and slow now.

718
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:41,850
Maybe raise her up a touch.

719
00:49:47,933 --> 00:49:50,433
Slip a hand under her bottom.

720
00:49:53,225 --> 00:49:55,201
There you go.

721
00:49:55,225 --> 00:49:58,141
The most beautiful bottom
in northern France.

722
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:05,242
Maybe we can leave the wig to chance.

723
00:50:05,266 --> 00:50:07,058
It's pinned pretty securely.

724
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:11,725
Even better, right?

725
00:50:59,975 --> 00:51:03,909
Nobody told him
that's the best way to get caught?

726
00:51:03,933 --> 00:51:06,159
- Jumping the turnstile?
- Sure.

727
00:51:06,183 --> 00:51:08,076
- Which stop?
- Le Raincy.

728
00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:11,492
So he's at the motel next door.

729
00:51:11,516 --> 00:51:15,242
Rack your brains
to hatch a plan to get him out.

730
00:51:15,266 --> 00:51:19,266
I'll come up with one too,
and we'll see which one's better.

731
00:51:21,558 --> 00:51:22,891
To break him out.

732
00:51:24,766 --> 00:51:25,617
Well?

733
00:51:25,641 --> 00:51:27,326
I've got it. Here we go.

734
00:51:27,350 --> 00:51:31,266
We borrow a municipal vehicle.
I hack a waiver...

735
00:51:32,891 --> 00:51:36,284
on internet from Immigration
and we make it look old.

736
00:51:36,308 --> 00:51:38,951
We rock up at the motel
in the municipal car,

737
00:51:38,975 --> 00:51:42,617
and say his cousin found the waiver
in his apartment. It happens.

738
00:51:42,641 --> 00:51:44,534
We can even

739
00:51:44,558 --> 00:51:45,641
hack a...

740
00:51:46,891 --> 00:51:48,951
Similarly, we can

741
00:51:48,975 --> 00:51:51,784
hack a residency permit
approved by City Hall

742
00:51:51,808 --> 00:51:54,409
'cause we know where the stamps are.
We know.

743
00:51:54,433 --> 00:51:55,826
It's a good plan.

744
00:51:55,850 --> 00:51:57,617
- Am I right?
- Yes, it's good.

745
00:51:57,641 --> 00:52:00,951
It's very good,
kind of cobbled together.

746
00:52:00,975 --> 00:52:02,933
But it's way too simple.

747
00:52:06,641 --> 00:52:08,201
There's no challenge.

748
00:52:08,225 --> 00:52:11,600
What's the point of a plan
with no degree of difficulty?

749
00:52:15,573 --> 00:52:19,174
I've never been to Germany.

750
00:52:19,198 --> 00:52:20,049
Louder.

751
00:52:20,073 --> 00:52:22,323
I've never been to Germany.

752
00:52:23,407 --> 00:52:24,990
Even louder.

753
00:52:34,532 --> 00:52:35,532
Stress!

754
00:52:39,532 --> 00:52:40,924
I abbreviated it.

755
00:52:40,948 --> 00:52:42,157
ArsÃ¨ne.

756
00:52:44,157 --> 00:52:46,924
The first name, ArsÃ¨ne...

757
00:52:46,948 --> 00:52:48,966
Ja. A little German.

758
00:52:48,990 --> 00:52:50,924
Reggae, the music.

759
00:52:50,948 --> 00:52:52,674
Brr, cold.

760
00:52:52,698 --> 00:52:55,508
Lee, a shelter. In a shelter.

761
00:52:55,532 --> 00:52:57,466
ArsÃ¨ne, ja,

762
00:52:57,490 --> 00:53:00,508
reggae, brr, lee, ben.

763
00:53:00,532 --> 00:53:03,782
Eighteen years I stayed.

764
00:53:34,865 --> 00:53:37,841
Since I'm only an assistant here,

765
00:53:37,865 --> 00:53:42,240
is my presence really necessary
at Friday's press conference?

766
00:53:43,573 --> 00:53:45,174
One moment, right back.

767
00:53:45,198 --> 00:53:47,466
Kamel! Are you coming back?

768
00:53:47,490 --> 00:53:49,073
- Yes?
- You went out?

769
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:53,049
- Yes, Emmanuelle.
- We'll let it go.

770
00:53:53,073 --> 00:53:54,591
Say, about Friday...

771
00:53:54,615 --> 00:53:56,466
I planned to mention Friday.

772
00:53:56,490 --> 00:53:57,799
You'd skip it too?

773
00:53:57,823 --> 00:53:59,549
Yes, something big's come up.

774
00:53:59,573 --> 00:54:01,698
I must be dreaming!

775
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:06,448
Does anyone on my team
have a sense of civic duty?

776
00:54:07,573 --> 00:54:09,674
In one year since we took office,

777
00:54:09,698 --> 00:54:13,508
this is the first time
I ask people to work overtime.

778
00:54:13,532 --> 00:54:15,341
And everybody backs out.

779
00:54:15,365 --> 00:54:16,841
You said we...

780
00:54:16,865 --> 00:54:19,133
Emmanuelle,
Kamel and I discussed it.

781
00:54:19,157 --> 00:54:21,133
Everything's just fine. Fabulous.

782
00:54:21,157 --> 00:54:23,698
Who asked you, BenoÃ®t?

783
00:54:24,740 --> 00:54:28,924
What does that even mean,
"Kamel and I discussed it"?

784
00:54:28,948 --> 00:54:30,424
Who is the mayor here?

785
00:54:30,448 --> 00:54:31,883
I am!

786
00:54:31,907 --> 00:54:33,424
Yes, Emmanuelle.

787
00:54:33,448 --> 00:54:35,841
What's with you? More exercises?

788
00:54:35,865 --> 00:54:37,633
So you want to duck out?

789
00:54:37,657 --> 00:54:39,466
That's just fine.

790
00:54:39,490 --> 00:54:42,174
We'll get by easily enough without you.

791
00:54:42,198 --> 00:54:45,508
In 10 years, I never asked a favor.
All day, every day,

792
00:54:45,532 --> 00:54:47,383
I fight for work-life balance.

793
00:54:47,407 --> 00:54:48,924
Schizophrenia has its limits.

794
00:54:48,948 --> 00:54:50,508
Once in one year,

795
00:54:50,532 --> 00:54:52,758
I ask 13 elected officials...

796
00:54:52,782 --> 00:54:53,924
13!

797
00:54:53,948 --> 00:54:55,573
Le Raincy has twice as many.

798
00:54:56,615 --> 00:54:58,424
Morning, ma'am.

799
00:54:58,448 --> 00:55:00,508
Can our teams be of service?

800
00:55:00,532 --> 00:55:03,966
This morning,
we left boxes out for recycling.

801
00:55:03,990 --> 00:55:05,383
They're still there.

802
00:55:05,407 --> 00:55:09,966
Our recycling operatives
do not pick up large boxes of the kind

803
00:55:09,990 --> 00:55:14,799
used for white goods since it involves
supplementary treatment costs.

804
00:55:14,823 --> 00:55:17,133
For collection and waste management,

805
00:55:17,157 --> 00:55:19,466
take them to the recycling center,

806
00:55:19,490 --> 00:55:21,466
good and...

807
00:55:21,490 --> 00:55:22,424
flat

808
00:55:22,448 --> 00:55:25,258
to facilitate handling.

809
00:55:25,282 --> 00:55:26,216
Have a good day.

810
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:28,216
Likewise. Goodbye, ma'am.

811
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:29,716
13 people,

812
00:55:29,740 --> 00:55:33,258
who spend their days
twiddling their thumbs,

813
00:55:33,282 --> 00:55:36,490
while I am accountable
for all their decisions.

814
00:55:39,365 --> 00:55:40,365
Hello!

815
00:55:45,198 --> 00:55:46,674
Drinks with the Jouberts?

816
00:55:46,698 --> 00:55:49,216
There's the press conference, though.

817
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:51,716
Exactly, yes. No but...

818
00:55:51,740 --> 00:55:52,740
Precisely.

819
00:55:57,990 --> 00:55:59,365
Emmanuelle, come here.

820
00:56:01,407 --> 00:56:04,883
Why get so worked up?
For 2 months now, you bark at me.

821
00:56:04,907 --> 00:56:06,157
I may have my reasons.

822
00:56:10,698 --> 00:56:13,407
One thing's for sure,
you're not happy with me.

823
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:18,948
I'll let you draw
the obvious conclusions.

824
00:56:21,823 --> 00:56:26,383
You know what?
We'll stop there. It's for the best.

825
00:56:26,407 --> 00:56:30,615
Prefect Franceschini
is asking about the council meeting.

826
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:35,674
No, I won't be at the council meeting.

827
00:56:35,698 --> 00:56:37,633
We, the police, need that data.

828
00:56:37,657 --> 00:56:39,591
I'll get it to you somehow.

829
00:56:39,615 --> 00:56:42,091
You talk on the phone now?

830
00:56:42,115 --> 00:56:43,508
I wish you'd been there.

831
00:56:43,532 --> 00:56:47,216
Kamel and I can go
from the Roma camp to the meeting.

832
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:48,883
Virginie!

833
00:56:48,907 --> 00:56:51,716
Sorry to intrude on your kiddie time,

834
00:56:51,740 --> 00:56:53,008
but can you cover it?

835
00:56:53,032 --> 00:56:54,799
I'll cover it with pleasure.

836
00:56:54,823 --> 00:56:56,841
Thank you, Virginie.

837
00:56:56,865 --> 00:56:57,990
You're welcome.

838
00:57:06,698 --> 00:57:08,841
What are you doing here?

839
00:57:08,865 --> 00:57:10,657
Riding the bus.

840
00:57:14,407 --> 00:57:17,258
You lost weight recently?

841
00:57:17,282 --> 00:57:18,365
Maybe.

842
00:57:19,740 --> 00:57:21,323
You're buff.

843
00:57:23,157 --> 00:57:25,216
Suits you, looking good.

844
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:26,698
I meant to tell you...

845
00:57:28,323 --> 00:57:30,966
The other day,
you were right about my outfit.

846
00:57:30,990 --> 00:57:32,424
It was ghastly.

847
00:57:32,448 --> 00:57:34,424
- Not ghastly.
- So tasteless.

848
00:57:34,448 --> 00:57:35,716
Vulgar.

849
00:57:35,740 --> 00:57:37,508
I owe you big time.

850
00:57:37,532 --> 00:57:40,799
I could've dressed like that forever.

851
00:57:40,823 --> 00:57:45,073
I'd have gone on my date Friday
in that outfit.

852
00:57:47,115 --> 00:57:48,282
Friday?

853
00:57:52,282 --> 00:57:53,532
Are you dumb?

854
00:57:55,240 --> 00:57:57,091
No.

855
00:57:57,115 --> 00:58:00,883
But I have something big on Friday, too.

856
00:58:00,907 --> 00:58:04,924
As I'm a mere assistant,
I think you can fix it for me.

857
00:58:04,948 --> 00:58:06,924
That's why I'm looking good.

858
00:58:06,948 --> 00:58:09,008
At last, my opinion matters.

859
00:58:09,032 --> 00:58:11,258
You made my life a misery all year.

860
00:58:11,282 --> 00:58:14,299
I can't say
you've been extremely friendly.

861
00:58:14,323 --> 00:58:16,383
Everything I do is wrong.

862
00:58:16,407 --> 00:58:18,549
I want people on the street, wrong.

863
00:58:18,573 --> 00:58:20,133
Do an Oomph-ma? Wrong

864
00:58:20,157 --> 00:58:22,508
Make a suggestion? That sucks.

865
00:58:22,532 --> 00:58:25,508
When my suggestions
are really good, mostly.

866
00:58:25,532 --> 00:58:28,466
- Pain in the butt.
- At the investiture, I was psyched.

867
00:58:28,490 --> 00:58:30,466
Full of life and enthusiasm.

868
00:58:30,490 --> 00:58:33,508
Everybody was fascinated
by my odd methods.

869
00:58:33,532 --> 00:58:35,591
Now I'm a shadow of that person.

870
00:58:35,615 --> 00:58:38,549
I'm nothing. You're a dictator, period.

871
00:58:38,573 --> 00:58:41,133
With your big democratic posturing.

872
00:58:41,157 --> 00:58:42,841
My

873
00:58:42,865 --> 00:58:44,091
ass.

874
00:58:44,115 --> 00:58:48,758
Any day now,
I might just ditch everything.

875
00:58:48,782 --> 00:58:50,674
I'll do my exercises.

876
00:58:50,698 --> 00:58:53,299
But for myself, and only once a day.

877
00:58:53,323 --> 00:58:55,466
In fact, I won't do my exercises

878
00:58:55,490 --> 00:58:57,966
because I'll make love six times a day.

879
00:58:57,990 --> 00:59:00,341
I'll still find a tiny second

880
00:59:00,365 --> 00:59:02,258
to write you an email to say

881
00:59:02,282 --> 00:59:04,091
you suck.

882
00:59:04,115 --> 00:59:05,490
I don't like you.

883
00:59:11,282 --> 00:59:12,841
In the trees.

884
00:59:12,865 --> 00:59:15,758
I have children. I live in Montfermeil.

885
00:59:15,782 --> 00:59:18,466
Welcome to my home.

886
00:59:18,490 --> 00:59:20,091
At Jean Richard Circus,

887
00:59:20,115 --> 00:59:22,508
we worked another four years.

888
00:59:22,532 --> 00:59:25,216
After the roof fell in,

889
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:27,841
we started working for Pinder.

890
00:59:27,865 --> 00:59:29,091
After Jean Richard,

891
00:59:29,115 --> 00:59:31,049
you worked at Pinder Circus?

892
00:59:31,073 --> 00:59:34,466
Afterward, we worked at Pinder.

893
00:59:34,490 --> 00:59:37,049
And after Pinder Circus?

894
00:59:37,073 --> 00:59:38,966
After Pinder Circus, we stopped.

895
00:59:38,990 --> 00:59:40,549
It's way too long

896
00:59:40,573 --> 00:59:42,924
if I tell you the whole story now,

897
00:59:42,948 --> 00:59:46,049
but he kept on working in tarps.

898
00:59:46,073 --> 00:59:48,633
He quit working with the circus...

899
00:59:48,657 --> 00:59:50,716
Because he broke his leg.

900
00:59:50,740 --> 00:59:55,049
He worked in the wind and rain.
He fell and broke his pelvis.

901
00:59:55,073 --> 00:59:58,716
He had retired but he kept working.

902
00:59:58,740 --> 01:00:02,299
He's a solid guy, my brother. Sturdy.

903
01:00:02,323 --> 01:00:06,115
I really wish there was a moat
around the motel.

904
01:00:08,448 --> 01:00:12,032
The night of the escape,
if there's time, we'll dig one.

905
01:00:20,823 --> 01:00:23,174
We need to make a rope ladder.

906
01:00:23,198 --> 01:00:26,383
We could take the drapes from City Hall

907
01:00:26,407 --> 01:00:29,782
and make a rope ladder
for him pretty easily.

908
01:00:31,115 --> 01:00:33,657
We'd send it to him in a pie.

909
01:00:34,990 --> 01:00:36,299
In the pie?

910
01:00:36,323 --> 01:00:38,157
That's usually how it works.

911
01:00:40,698 --> 01:00:43,133
I don't get why he needs a rope ladder.

912
01:00:43,157 --> 01:00:44,633
To use it.

913
01:00:44,657 --> 01:00:46,740
He must have a rope ladder.

914
01:00:49,032 --> 01:00:50,365
They've all got one.

915
01:01:04,948 --> 01:01:07,549
Sorry to barge in
on purpose at breakfast,

916
01:01:07,573 --> 01:01:09,258
to be sure to find you in.

917
01:01:09,282 --> 01:01:12,049
BenoÃ®t Survenant,
deputy mayor, eco-solidarity.

918
01:01:12,073 --> 01:01:14,157
Your parents are in? May I?

919
01:01:15,823 --> 01:01:16,990
Fabulous.

920
01:01:22,407 --> 01:01:23,407
Here we are.

921
01:01:24,907 --> 01:01:26,198
Fabulous.

922
01:01:38,823 --> 01:01:41,466
So I have been charged,

923
01:01:41,490 --> 01:01:44,323
for purposes of job creation...

924
01:01:47,740 --> 01:01:50,966
I'm looking for people who lived here,
whom the PUR,

925
01:01:50,990 --> 01:01:54,924
meaning the Plan for Renovation,
ran out.

926
01:01:54,948 --> 01:01:58,591
Why come to us last?
Of all the kids at school?

927
01:01:58,615 --> 01:02:01,591
I don't know,
I have lots of families to do still.

928
01:02:01,615 --> 01:02:03,823
With kids in lots of other schools.

929
01:02:09,323 --> 01:02:13,008
You are the mother
of these fabulous children, I suppose?

930
01:02:13,032 --> 01:02:15,549
Might there be,
among your acquaintances,

931
01:02:15,573 --> 01:02:17,698
people who were run out?

932
01:02:21,448 --> 01:02:23,049
Don't be dumb.

933
01:02:23,073 --> 01:02:24,799
She's not our mom.

934
01:02:24,823 --> 01:02:26,758
She looks after us.

935
01:02:26,782 --> 01:02:29,032
Our mother and father are at work.

936
01:02:30,823 --> 01:02:32,008
No?

937
01:02:32,032 --> 01:02:33,240
I see.

938
01:02:35,990 --> 01:02:37,157
I'll make tracks.

939
01:02:39,615 --> 01:02:42,049
BenoÃ®t Survenant.

940
01:02:42,073 --> 01:02:43,758
Isn't that right?

941
01:02:43,782 --> 01:02:46,990
Your parents can find me at City Hall.

942
01:02:49,032 --> 01:02:50,841
And fabulous news...

943
01:02:50,865 --> 01:02:53,466
The people who were run out

944
01:02:53,490 --> 01:02:54,865
are badly wanted now.

945
01:03:02,740 --> 01:03:05,883
- You wanted a word?
- Yes, about what you said.

946
01:03:05,907 --> 01:03:07,633
Sorry, I was...

947
01:03:07,657 --> 01:03:08,716
I lost my cool.

948
01:03:08,740 --> 01:03:10,657
No, I think you were right.

949
01:03:11,698 --> 01:03:14,883
You'll be happier
on someone else's team.

950
01:03:14,907 --> 01:03:16,424
You think so?

951
01:03:16,448 --> 01:03:18,549
I'm sure of it.

952
01:03:18,573 --> 01:03:21,782
I printed an email
that won't make a transfer harder.

953
01:03:28,907 --> 01:03:31,758
All that's left
is for us to say goodbye.

954
01:03:31,782 --> 01:03:32,907
Goodbye, Emmanuelle.

955
01:03:42,532 --> 01:03:43,990
She apologized, I guess?

956
01:03:47,907 --> 01:03:51,865
"To whom it may concern,
Kamel Mrabti leaves my team voluntarily.

957
01:03:53,573 --> 01:03:56,657
"Mr. Mrabti began in Montfermeil
as a community organizer.

958
01:03:57,698 --> 01:04:02,216
"His diligence saw him elected councilor,
then deputy mayor.

959
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:06,383
"In his five years as our right-hand man,
he has proven to be

960
01:04:06,407 --> 01:04:09,549
"reliable, professional and resourceful.

961
01:04:09,573 --> 01:04:13,133
"We commend his work
without reservation.

962
01:04:13,157 --> 01:04:16,490
"He takes with him our best wishes
for his future projects.

963
01:04:17,698 --> 01:04:18,907
"Emmanuelle Joly."

964
01:04:35,615 --> 01:04:37,008
"I no longer accuse

965
01:04:37,032 --> 01:04:38,782
"I no longer curse

966
01:04:39,865 --> 01:04:41,966
"But let me cry!"

967
01:04:41,990 --> 01:04:44,091
My dear Kamel, every one of us,

968
01:04:44,115 --> 01:04:46,674
every member of this extraordinary team,

969
01:04:46,698 --> 01:04:50,758
will agree with me when I say
this is a shock and a surprise.

970
01:04:50,782 --> 01:04:55,883
We have a sense
of losing a splendid coworker.

971
01:04:55,907 --> 01:04:59,966
We all wish you
all the luck you richly deserve.

972
01:04:59,990 --> 01:05:03,424
The whole team gathered here

973
01:05:03,448 --> 01:05:05,674
wants to say thank you.

974
01:05:05,698 --> 01:05:10,508
Thank you for your courage,
for your innovation, for all you gave us.

975
01:05:10,532 --> 01:05:12,865
Happens every day, people getting fired.

976
01:05:15,698 --> 01:05:18,323
We're heading for the press conference.

977
01:05:23,240 --> 01:05:24,133
Beg pardon?

978
01:05:24,157 --> 01:05:26,948
The press conference
was canceled two weeks ago.

979
01:05:30,198 --> 01:05:31,966
Why?

980
01:05:31,990 --> 01:05:33,633
No more empty promises

981
01:05:33,657 --> 01:05:36,448
in the media
to fake interest in our communities.

982
01:05:41,865 --> 01:05:43,799
Kamel, it's Selim.

983
01:05:43,823 --> 01:05:45,466
Look...

984
01:05:45,490 --> 01:05:48,698
The press conference is canceled,
so meet you wherever.

985
01:05:51,032 --> 01:05:52,323
See you right away.

986
01:05:58,490 --> 01:06:03,008
All his working life here.
A brother to you. You'd done it all.

987
01:06:03,032 --> 01:06:06,573
The best staffer you have.
Why let him go?

988
01:06:07,823 --> 01:06:12,008
Mr. Bouazzi, you enjoy working
on my team, don't you?

989
01:06:12,032 --> 01:06:15,216
You want to finish the work
you have begun?

990
01:06:15,240 --> 01:06:16,591
Yes.

991
01:06:16,615 --> 01:06:18,674
I believe in it.

992
01:06:18,698 --> 01:06:19,990
It's a short-term contract?

993
01:06:21,865 --> 01:06:23,758
Yes, it is, madam mayor.

994
01:06:23,782 --> 01:06:27,008
And I have a family with four children.

995
01:06:27,032 --> 01:06:29,490
So mind your own business
and go home.

996
01:06:31,115 --> 01:06:32,615
Yes, Madam Mayor.

997
01:07:03,573 --> 01:07:05,032
What will she be reading?

998
01:07:06,490 --> 01:07:08,549
Life and Fate, Vasily Grossman

999
01:07:08,573 --> 01:07:09,948
Life and Fate!

1000
01:07:12,407 --> 01:07:16,133
And on the table, in plain sight,
there should be

1001
01:07:16,157 --> 01:07:18,049
a leopard's tail.

1002
01:07:18,073 --> 01:07:19,157
Leopard's tail?

1003
01:07:24,907 --> 01:07:26,091
Well?

1004
01:07:26,115 --> 01:07:28,549
Hold on, there's a chick there.

1005
01:07:28,573 --> 01:07:31,383
She's stunningly beautiful.

1006
01:07:31,407 --> 01:07:32,740
But no book.

1007
01:07:35,115 --> 01:07:37,032
There she is, behind the pillar.

1008
01:07:38,073 --> 01:07:39,216
Yes, that's it.

1009
01:07:39,240 --> 01:07:41,216
Life and Fate, Grossman.

1010
01:07:41,240 --> 01:07:44,799
And the tail?
There's a furry thing poking out.

1011
01:07:44,823 --> 01:07:45,865
That's it.

1012
01:07:47,157 --> 01:07:48,841
What?

1013
01:07:48,865 --> 01:07:49,907
Is she pretty?

1014
01:07:52,532 --> 01:07:54,299
Yes, very pretty.

1015
01:07:54,323 --> 01:07:56,466
She's pretty.

1016
01:07:56,490 --> 01:07:59,532
There's something about her...

1017
01:08:02,782 --> 01:08:04,466
like Joelle.

1018
01:08:04,490 --> 01:08:06,174
Joelle, my ex-wife?

1019
01:08:06,198 --> 01:08:08,758
You can't say Joelle isn't beautiful.

1020
01:08:08,782 --> 01:08:11,323
Are we really discussing Joelle here?

1021
01:08:14,865 --> 01:08:16,466
Listen up, brother.

1022
01:08:16,490 --> 01:08:18,049
If you don't like Joelle,

1023
01:08:18,073 --> 01:08:20,758
I swear you won't like this girl.

1024
01:08:20,782 --> 01:08:21,865
How come?

1025
01:08:23,740 --> 01:08:25,365
It is Joelle.

1026
01:08:27,948 --> 01:08:29,282
You're feeling furry?

1027
01:08:31,407 --> 01:08:32,865
Or in a fury?

1028
01:08:35,323 --> 01:08:38,008
Just kidding,
you don't look like a fury.

1029
01:08:38,032 --> 01:08:41,948
Do you know when they close the doors
in this theatre?

1030
01:08:43,032 --> 01:08:45,299
Life and Fate, fabulous!

1031
01:08:45,323 --> 01:08:47,383
You've started it?

1032
01:08:47,407 --> 01:08:51,633
Perhaps you saw last year at Documenta,

1033
01:08:51,657 --> 01:08:53,591
those painted apples by

1034
01:08:53,615 --> 01:08:56,216
Korbinian Aigner.

1035
01:08:56,240 --> 01:08:59,174
The priest and gardener
who fought the Nazis.

1036
01:08:59,198 --> 01:09:00,091
Evening.

1037
01:09:00,115 --> 01:09:03,341
You know the anti-Nazi priest
who developed apples at Dachau?

1038
01:09:03,365 --> 01:09:06,633
The KZ-1 apple, KZ-2 and KZ-3 too.

1039
01:09:06,657 --> 01:09:09,573
Excuse me, do you mind if we swap seats?

1040
01:09:11,990 --> 01:09:14,341
What is this all about?

1041
01:09:14,365 --> 01:09:15,532
What brings you here?

1042
01:09:17,490 --> 01:09:19,323
No, I'm sorry...

1043
01:09:21,157 --> 01:09:22,740
Sorry, have your seat back.

1044
01:09:23,823 --> 01:09:26,073
Sorry, but can you sit there?

1045
01:09:27,698 --> 01:09:29,032
Late, isn't he?

1046
01:09:30,448 --> 01:09:32,174
I'll swap with you.

1047
01:09:32,198 --> 01:09:35,049
A tough week, a vile day,
is no reason

1048
01:09:35,073 --> 01:09:37,716
to tail me on the street
all the way here.

1049
01:09:37,740 --> 01:09:39,115
Keep your bitterness.

1050
01:09:40,740 --> 01:09:42,841
Bitter, me?

1051
01:09:42,865 --> 01:09:44,841
In five minutes on the phone,

1052
01:09:44,865 --> 01:09:48,216
I had two far more spectacular offers.

1053
01:09:48,240 --> 01:09:49,633
Great, I'm...

1054
01:09:49,657 --> 01:09:51,591
delighted for you.

1055
01:09:51,615 --> 01:09:52,615
Sorry.

1056
01:10:06,990 --> 01:10:08,907
You're interested in dance now?

1057
01:10:12,115 --> 01:10:14,174
You too perhaps?

1058
01:10:14,198 --> 01:10:16,841
Gaping holes in your knowledge of me.

1059
01:10:16,865 --> 01:10:20,049
Thank goodness
because I know what I'd find.

1060
01:10:20,073 --> 01:10:23,799
Instead of a heart, a mirror.
And instead of non-urban time

1061
01:10:23,823 --> 01:10:28,282
spent loving people around you,
a political manifesto doomed to fail.

1062
01:10:32,240 --> 01:10:33,508
You always combined

1063
01:10:33,532 --> 01:10:35,823
analysis and cruelty, anyway.

1064
01:10:47,740 --> 01:10:51,758
I based my campaign and policies
on people being necessary.

1065
01:10:51,782 --> 01:10:53,924
We need them to fill jobs.

1066
01:10:53,948 --> 01:10:55,258
And we'll house them.

1067
01:10:55,282 --> 01:10:59,258
BenoÃ®t has spent all year
on the road looking for people

1068
01:10:59,282 --> 01:11:03,466
and getting the word out
that we're working for eco-solidarity.

1069
01:11:03,490 --> 01:11:05,758
I don't need your stump speech.

1070
01:11:05,782 --> 01:11:07,258
Stop being so mean.

1071
01:11:07,282 --> 01:11:10,258
Do you realize
people will feel betrayed

1072
01:11:10,282 --> 01:11:13,115
if they think
I'm going to build offices?

1073
01:11:14,448 --> 01:11:17,216
They'll think I'm bringing them back
not to rehouse them

1074
01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:20,591
but perhaps put them in camps.

1075
01:11:20,615 --> 01:11:24,133
It's unbearable. I can't bear the idea.

1076
01:11:24,157 --> 01:11:27,341
The Prefecture must refute it.
You must refute it.

1077
01:11:27,365 --> 01:11:30,258
Refute the fantasies of Emmanuelle Joly?

1078
01:11:30,282 --> 01:11:33,049
An interesting take on our relationship.

1079
01:11:33,073 --> 01:11:34,966
You're losing it.

1080
01:11:34,990 --> 01:11:36,157
Losing it.

1081
01:11:37,198 --> 01:11:41,032
Why not send international lawyers
to fight rumors, too?

1082
01:11:42,865 --> 01:11:44,990
Well, that's enough now.

1083
01:11:52,865 --> 01:11:54,924
"They dug and dug,

1084
01:11:54,948 --> 01:11:56,591
"dug and dug...

1085
01:11:56,615 --> 01:11:59,633
Dug and dug
every day and every night...

1086
01:11:59,657 --> 01:12:00,948
"It snowed...

1087
01:12:02,573 --> 01:12:04,032
"It snowed...

1088
01:12:05,157 --> 01:12:06,407
"Still it snowed.

1089
01:12:09,907 --> 01:12:12,049
"They were no longer

1090
01:12:12,073 --> 01:12:13,216
"living hearts,

1091
01:12:13,240 --> 01:12:16,133
"but a dream wandering in the mist.

1092
01:12:16,157 --> 01:12:18,258
"The frightening solitude...

1093
01:12:18,282 --> 01:12:21,657
No, "the solitude,
enormous and frightening to see."

1094
01:12:59,490 --> 01:13:02,091
Best place for her is a psych ward.

1095
01:13:02,115 --> 01:13:05,508
Sorry, Ms. Bedoult,
what exactly is your relationship

1096
01:13:05,532 --> 01:13:07,508
with Ms. Joly?

1097
01:13:07,532 --> 01:13:08,657
Well...

1098
01:13:11,740 --> 01:13:13,383
I'd describe myself

1099
01:13:13,407 --> 01:13:16,049
as a kind of interface

1100
01:13:16,073 --> 01:13:17,698
for purposes of translation.

1101
01:13:20,073 --> 01:13:24,258
I dispatch all the decisions she makes,

1102
01:13:24,282 --> 01:13:26,674
reformulating them

1103
01:13:26,698 --> 01:13:28,799
to make sure that there is not

1104
01:13:28,823 --> 01:13:30,674
the tiniest,

1105
01:13:30,698 --> 01:13:32,799
most infinitesimal

1106
01:13:32,823 --> 01:13:34,508
part

1107
01:13:34,532 --> 01:13:36,591
of a part

1108
01:13:36,615 --> 01:13:39,383
of the interpretation
that is misinterpreted.

1109
01:13:39,407 --> 01:13:41,633
I am a witness to decisions...

1110
01:13:41,657 --> 01:13:43,174
So you're her secretary.

1111
01:13:43,198 --> 01:13:46,032
Sorry, but did I call you a dealer?

1112
01:13:50,782 --> 01:13:53,073
What happened? How are you?

1113
01:13:56,532 --> 01:13:57,657
It was

1114
01:13:59,573 --> 01:14:01,841
a shock.

1115
01:14:01,865 --> 01:14:04,049
Dreadful. You have no idea.

1116
01:14:04,073 --> 01:14:07,240
I just need to get over it.

1117
01:14:09,198 --> 01:14:10,948
But it must be our secret.

1118
01:14:12,573 --> 01:14:13,966
Of course.

1119
01:14:13,990 --> 01:14:16,049
- It won't get out.
- You...

1120
01:14:16,073 --> 01:14:17,133
Emmanuelle

1121
01:14:17,157 --> 01:14:18,282
and me.

1122
01:14:30,407 --> 01:14:32,633
I don't want an injection.

1123
01:14:32,657 --> 01:14:34,216
I don't want an injection.

1124
01:14:34,240 --> 01:14:35,883
You won't have an injection.

1125
01:14:35,907 --> 01:14:38,549
- She won't.
- No injections.

1126
01:14:38,573 --> 01:14:39,740
You won't have one.

1127
01:14:48,615 --> 01:14:51,115
I surfed those Poupamis.

1128
01:15:00,365 --> 01:15:01,448
What puppies?

1129
01:15:03,365 --> 01:15:05,133
No.

1130
01:15:05,157 --> 01:15:07,049
- They're not puppies.
- What then?

1131
01:15:07,073 --> 01:15:08,508
Not puppies.

1132
01:15:08,532 --> 01:15:10,549
Not the Poupamis.

1133
01:15:10,573 --> 01:15:12,508
They're Poumapis.

1134
01:15:12,532 --> 01:15:14,907
Denis and Virginie
are campaigning on internet

1135
01:15:15,948 --> 01:15:18,341
to try to undermine me.

1136
01:15:18,365 --> 01:15:20,448
And they nearly succeeded.

1137
01:15:26,323 --> 01:15:28,299
Why would they undermine you?

1138
01:15:28,323 --> 01:15:31,883
To turn Station Plaza into offices.
They have lists.

1139
01:15:31,907 --> 01:15:33,133
What lists?

1140
01:15:33,157 --> 01:15:36,258
Lists of folks they removed,
kept removing.

1141
01:15:36,282 --> 01:15:37,865
And the lists from before...

1142
01:15:40,532 --> 01:15:44,633
They won't let us have them
so we never find anyone.

1143
01:15:44,657 --> 01:15:47,990
They are depopulators, you see?

1144
01:15:49,490 --> 01:15:50,924
They are the Poumapis,

1145
01:15:50,948 --> 01:15:52,633
in cahoots with the Prefect.

1146
01:15:52,657 --> 01:15:53,907
The Poumapis?

1147
01:15:58,657 --> 01:16:01,549
I realized when I saw
their new homepage.

1148
01:16:01,573 --> 01:16:05,841
"They dug and dug,
every day and every night."

1149
01:16:05,865 --> 01:16:08,258
It was poetry, and I realized.

1150
01:16:08,282 --> 01:16:13,091
It reminded me of,
"It snowed. Whoever lay down, died."

1151
01:16:13,115 --> 01:16:16,591
"And the desert devoured the caravans."

1152
01:16:16,615 --> 01:16:18,841
- Victor Hugo.
- Yes, I'm devastated.

1153
01:16:18,865 --> 01:16:22,198
I put so much trust in them.
I thought they had my back.

1154
01:16:23,740 --> 01:16:25,115
Thanks for coming.

1155
01:16:26,782 --> 01:16:30,299
Will you stand in for me on Monday?

1156
01:16:30,323 --> 01:16:31,532
Yes, I will.

1157
01:16:33,157 --> 01:16:35,448
But what do I do about Victor Hugo?

1158
01:16:36,573 --> 01:16:39,174
I'm not entirely sure of the procedure.

1159
01:16:39,198 --> 01:16:40,907
I'll leave it up to you.

1160
01:17:00,198 --> 01:17:03,448
Juliette, I should thank you.
You saved my life.

1161
01:17:04,823 --> 01:17:05,907
It was nothing.

1162
01:17:07,365 --> 01:17:10,073
No, not nothing. Life's not nothing.

1163
01:17:12,573 --> 01:17:16,091
You know, girls in relationships

1164
01:17:16,115 --> 01:17:18,008
at our ages,

1165
01:17:18,032 --> 01:17:20,299
they're in a living nightmare.

1166
01:17:20,323 --> 01:17:22,573
Fights, tyranny, duplicity.

1167
01:17:24,573 --> 01:17:27,282
Solitude is worse
when supposedly you're a couple.

1168
01:17:29,115 --> 01:17:30,198
I know.

1169
01:17:32,323 --> 01:17:33,698
And you? All good?

1170
01:17:34,823 --> 01:17:36,323
Yes, all good.

1171
01:17:41,948 --> 01:17:44,115
You're an incurable romantic.

1172
01:17:45,198 --> 01:17:46,508
I had an idea.

1173
01:17:46,532 --> 01:17:49,383
I'll transfer you
to International Affairs.

1174
01:17:49,407 --> 01:17:51,990
You've done enough secretarial.

1175
01:17:53,323 --> 01:17:54,532
I love you.

1176
01:17:57,240 --> 01:17:58,448
You're my friend.

1177
01:18:05,015 --> 01:18:06,807
Our heartiest congratulations!

1178
01:18:08,973 --> 01:18:11,241
What a relief!

1179
01:18:11,265 --> 01:18:14,199
Now we're a happy family again.

1180
01:18:14,223 --> 01:18:17,449
Haroun, where's mom? What?

1181
01:18:17,473 --> 01:18:19,199
Is it serious?

1182
01:18:19,223 --> 01:18:22,199
Tell her to take her time
getting better.

1183
01:18:22,223 --> 01:18:24,158
Honestly, Kamel,

1184
01:18:24,182 --> 01:18:26,699
it's fabulous,
as good old BenoÃ®t might say.

1185
01:18:26,723 --> 01:18:27,890
What's fabulous?

1186
01:18:28,932 --> 01:18:30,283
We have beagle eyes.

1187
01:18:30,307 --> 01:18:33,723
We saw your ex-wife
is a political ball-and-chain.

1188
01:18:34,807 --> 01:18:37,866
She wants to take initiatives
at City Hall

1189
01:18:37,890 --> 01:18:39,807
by relying on you, but not!

1190
01:18:41,057 --> 01:18:42,932
Can we leave Joelle out of this?

1191
01:18:44,890 --> 01:18:47,116
Ideally, you'd meet someone,

1192
01:18:47,140 --> 01:18:49,533
a woman who straightens stuff out

1193
01:18:49,557 --> 01:18:52,408
so Joelle reconsiders
her professional goals.

1194
01:18:52,432 --> 01:18:54,324
One more word, I punch you.

1195
01:18:54,348 --> 01:18:55,741
You don't understand,

1196
01:18:55,765 --> 01:18:57,866
Virginie agrees with you.

1197
01:18:57,890 --> 01:19:00,033
Like I give a shit. You're fired.

1198
01:19:00,057 --> 01:19:00,991
Fired!

1199
01:19:01,015 --> 01:19:01,991
Out!

1200
01:19:02,015 --> 01:19:04,449
We're done. I'm sick of you.

1201
01:19:04,473 --> 01:19:05,991
Crappy hypocrites!

1202
01:19:06,015 --> 01:19:07,015
Juliette!

1203
01:19:10,432 --> 01:19:12,324
Marylin! BenoÃ®t!

1204
01:19:12,348 --> 01:19:14,283
You heard what he called us?

1205
01:19:14,307 --> 01:19:15,324
Hypocrites!

1206
01:19:15,348 --> 01:19:16,616
Me? The visionary.

1207
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:18,658
The foreteller of cities.

1208
01:19:18,682 --> 01:19:20,699
You're all witnesses.

1209
01:19:20,723 --> 01:19:22,949
Witnesses to the language

1210
01:19:22,973 --> 01:19:23,973
this man uses.

1211
01:19:28,307 --> 01:19:29,515
Beat it.

1212
01:19:33,348 --> 01:19:35,491
I'm the boss now.

1213
01:19:35,515 --> 01:19:36,765
Get out of my sight.

1214
01:20:11,265 --> 01:20:15,991
You may think you're Giant Barabo

1215
01:20:16,015 --> 01:20:19,074
but I'm not your brother Poumapi.

1216
01:20:19,098 --> 01:20:21,824
A sin confessed
is not always forgiven, Poumapi.

1217
01:20:21,848 --> 01:20:22,699
Barabo!

1218
01:20:22,723 --> 01:20:25,658
I'll stave in your abdomen.

1219
01:20:25,682 --> 01:20:26,682
Bravo!

1220
01:20:40,098 --> 01:20:41,265
Your belongings.

1221
01:20:52,765 --> 01:20:54,307
Mom's not eating.

1222
01:20:55,932 --> 01:20:58,074
In ten days, it's Brioche Day.

1223
01:20:58,098 --> 01:21:00,283
We'll need you, for all the stress.

1224
01:21:00,307 --> 01:21:02,574
Make a speedy recovery.

1225
01:21:02,598 --> 01:21:05,408
I think I'll be on my feet
in a couple days.

1226
01:21:05,432 --> 01:21:07,658
Don't pressurize yourself.

1227
01:21:07,682 --> 01:21:08,932
You shouldn't...

1228
01:21:11,098 --> 01:21:14,033
I feel kind of responsible.

1229
01:21:14,057 --> 01:21:15,057
You?

1230
01:21:19,515 --> 01:21:23,324
Not a chance.
It's way bigger than you, unfortunately.

1231
01:21:23,348 --> 01:21:24,723
The problem is...

1232
01:21:26,765 --> 01:21:28,158
Let's say, psychological.

1233
01:21:28,182 --> 01:21:30,199
Mom, you got an IM.

1234
01:21:30,223 --> 01:21:32,598
I received an IM? Really?

1235
01:21:36,557 --> 01:21:39,783
Children, how about you get dad a drink?

1236
01:21:39,807 --> 01:21:41,824
Don't you want a drink?

1237
01:21:41,848 --> 01:21:43,699
- It's the Fox.
- Yes.

1238
01:21:43,723 --> 01:21:44,723
Go to your rooms.

1239
01:21:53,390 --> 01:21:54,640
Good news?

1240
01:21:57,473 --> 01:21:58,807
Very good.

1241
01:21:59,890 --> 01:22:03,033
Know what?
I'll be on my feet tomorrow.

1242
01:22:03,057 --> 01:22:04,932
Goodness, what a transformation!

1243
01:22:06,015 --> 01:22:08,241
You know, if I wasn't so happy,

1244
01:22:08,265 --> 01:22:10,658
- I'd be mad at you.
- At me?

1245
01:22:10,682 --> 01:22:14,699
- How come?
- You ruined my evening out.

1246
01:22:14,723 --> 01:22:18,723
I was right to tell you to move.
My friend saw us talking.

1247
01:22:19,932 --> 01:22:22,366
- He began to wonder.
- If we're dating?

1248
01:22:22,390 --> 01:22:23,783
Obviously.

1249
01:22:23,807 --> 01:22:24,658
Listen.

1250
01:22:24,682 --> 01:22:28,449
"Be honest, who was the hot guy?
Looked a real heartbreaker."

1251
01:22:28,473 --> 01:22:31,658
A little jealousy won't hurt him.

1252
01:22:31,682 --> 01:22:32,991
He sees you there,

1253
01:22:33,015 --> 01:22:35,658
with another guy, so he backs off?

1254
01:22:35,682 --> 01:22:39,741
Listen to you. It's unbelievable.

1255
01:22:39,765 --> 01:22:42,533
He wasn't scared of you.
It's called tact.

1256
01:22:42,557 --> 01:22:43,533
He's discreet.

1257
01:22:43,557 --> 01:22:46,574
How could I explain
a guy like him to you?

1258
01:22:46,598 --> 01:22:47,449
He says,

1259
01:22:47,473 --> 01:22:51,033
"I await the soft, noble form she takes
to follow her

1260
01:22:51,057 --> 01:22:52,890
"and love her only.

1261
01:22:54,182 --> 01:22:56,991
"A flash of lightning that lasts."

1262
01:22:57,015 --> 01:22:58,658
I'm having a brain wave.

1263
01:22:58,682 --> 01:23:02,783
Is the journey
Marylin's organizing to Romania still on?

1264
01:23:02,807 --> 01:23:06,574
Tomorrow, ask her to book
two seats on the bus for me?

1265
01:23:06,598 --> 01:23:10,574
An absolute brain wave.
Transylvania with my love.

1266
01:23:10,598 --> 01:23:12,908
Not Transylvania. What is this?

1267
01:23:12,932 --> 01:23:15,533
Vampire country for a first date?

1268
01:23:15,557 --> 01:23:18,283
But it isn't a first date.

1269
01:23:18,307 --> 01:23:21,949
We got married a year and a half ago
on Second Life.

1270
01:23:21,973 --> 01:23:23,783
Transylvania, come on!

1271
01:23:23,807 --> 01:23:25,324
There's no snow even!

1272
01:23:25,348 --> 01:23:27,283
You're serious about a trip?

1273
01:23:27,307 --> 01:23:29,408
The Caribbean.

1274
01:23:29,432 --> 01:23:31,283
The Dominican Republic's cool.

1275
01:23:31,307 --> 01:23:34,408
Marylin says you booked
the last seats to the Carpathians.

1276
01:23:34,432 --> 01:23:36,348
Yes, I did.

1277
01:23:38,515 --> 01:23:40,182
For me and my boyfriend.

1278
01:23:41,640 --> 01:23:43,366
Great.

1279
01:23:43,390 --> 01:23:45,848
- The leopard print is for him?
- Yes.

1280
01:23:49,182 --> 01:23:52,949
I told Judy, the English teacher,

1281
01:23:52,973 --> 01:23:54,765
to sign up with her husband.

1282
01:23:58,265 --> 01:23:59,432
Shoot.

1283
01:24:01,307 --> 01:24:02,765
I'm really sorry.

1284
01:24:03,932 --> 01:24:07,408
Suggest she tries
the European Parliament in Brussels.

1285
01:24:07,432 --> 01:24:11,074
No, that trip's too good.
I dislike her husband.

1286
01:24:11,098 --> 01:24:14,991
He's a graceless fellow
who spread gossip about me.

1287
01:24:15,015 --> 01:24:18,408
I'll recommend something really sinister.

1288
01:24:18,432 --> 01:24:19,908
Like...

1289
01:24:19,932 --> 01:24:22,033
Crossing lugubrious mountains.

1290
01:24:22,057 --> 01:24:24,991
Sleeping in rooms reeking of garlic
under crucifixes.

1291
01:24:25,015 --> 01:24:28,574
In hotels built by Ceausescu,
all without snow.

1292
01:24:28,598 --> 01:24:29,658
Picture it.

1293
01:24:29,682 --> 01:24:32,307
The ultimate buzzkill. Funny, isn't it?

1294
01:24:34,932 --> 01:24:35,932
Sorry...

1295
01:24:37,140 --> 01:24:39,848
I'm running down your vacation.

1296
01:24:42,348 --> 01:24:45,616
No, honestly, what do you think?

1297
01:24:45,640 --> 01:24:48,033
I don't know, it's hard to say.

1298
01:24:48,057 --> 01:24:49,783
What would you say

1299
01:24:49,807 --> 01:24:51,658
to the Caribbean?

1300
01:24:51,682 --> 01:24:54,158
The Caribbean's good. It's...

1301
01:24:54,182 --> 01:24:56,908
The Caribbean,
like the Dominican Republic?

1302
01:24:56,932 --> 01:24:59,283
Yes, exactly that.

1303
01:24:59,307 --> 01:25:02,033
You're instantly hotter
than in Europe or Algeria.

1304
01:25:02,057 --> 01:25:04,074
Than here I mean,
due to humidity.

1305
01:25:04,098 --> 01:25:05,908
Your hair curls.

1306
01:25:05,932 --> 01:25:08,283
Your skin's luscious and lustrous.

1307
01:25:08,307 --> 01:25:11,158
In 30 minutes,
you shed 10 years.

1308
01:25:11,182 --> 01:25:14,682
You spend all day,
snuggling in the sand.

1309
01:25:15,973 --> 01:25:18,658
Or naked in the water.

1310
01:25:18,682 --> 01:25:20,074
There's nobody around.

1311
01:25:20,098 --> 01:25:24,140
You make love in the turquoise sea.

1312
01:25:27,473 --> 01:25:30,533
- Goodbye, Ms. Joly.
- See you Monday.

1313
01:25:30,557 --> 01:25:33,199
Evening, what brings you here?

1314
01:25:33,223 --> 01:25:34,824
Weren't you discharged?

1315
01:25:34,848 --> 01:25:36,949
No, I'm still there.

1316
01:25:36,973 --> 01:25:40,074
For a while longer, in Section 15 now.

1317
01:25:40,098 --> 01:25:42,533
I attend the day hospital. Outpatient.

1318
01:25:42,557 --> 01:25:46,241
- Great. You go home every night?
- Exactly.

1319
01:25:46,265 --> 01:25:49,699
- You can even go on vacation.
- Yes, I think so.

1320
01:25:49,723 --> 01:25:51,658
- Where will you go?
- I don't know.

1321
01:25:51,682 --> 01:25:53,283
Take care of yourself.

1322
01:25:53,307 --> 01:25:54,449
I'm not crazy.

1323
01:25:54,473 --> 01:25:56,473
- Goodbye, Mr. Boutih.
- Goodbye, Ms. Joly.

1324
01:26:13,765 --> 01:26:14,824
"Now,

1325
01:26:14,848 --> 01:26:17,158
"I am my corpse, deep in a well.

1326
01:26:17,182 --> 01:26:19,824
"I breathed my last long ago.

1327
01:26:19,848 --> 01:26:22,616
"My heart long since stopped beating.

1328
01:26:22,640 --> 01:26:26,408
"Besides the bastard who killed me,
no one knows what happened."

1329
01:26:26,432 --> 01:26:31,699
"Desperados from Indian territory
will steal the slave during expulsion.

1330
01:26:31,723 --> 01:26:34,533
"They'll come up from Clichy
onto the plateau

1331
01:26:34,557 --> 01:26:38,116
"to enter the slave's motel
and whisk him away."

1332
01:26:38,140 --> 01:26:39,824
"I'm supposed to hold back

1333
01:26:39,848 --> 01:26:42,366
"and sound a white-tin horn
if there's danger.

1334
01:26:42,390 --> 01:26:46,324
"But I shall bleat like a sheep
when they enter

1335
01:26:46,348 --> 01:26:48,241
"and shall not blow the horn.

1336
01:26:48,265 --> 01:26:50,932
"So send in a SWAT team, no worries."

1337
01:27:10,598 --> 01:27:12,241
Not exactly reassuring.

1338
01:27:12,265 --> 01:27:15,182
Don't go chicken on us,
so close to our goal.

1339
01:28:11,140 --> 01:28:14,557
If you can somehow manage to...

1340
01:28:17,682 --> 01:28:18,848
Hold on...

1341
01:28:49,432 --> 01:28:52,283
Scared of the dark, BenoÃ®t?

1342
01:28:52,307 --> 01:28:55,199
No. Not anymore.

1343
01:28:55,223 --> 01:28:56,848
As a boy, yes.

1344
01:29:34,223 --> 01:29:36,491
It's good. Really good.

1345
01:29:36,515 --> 01:29:37,491
Really very good.

1346
01:29:37,515 --> 01:29:39,807
We can be proud of ourselves.

1347
01:29:44,223 --> 01:29:46,324
You have plans for the vacation?

1348
01:29:46,348 --> 01:29:47,348
Yes.

1349
01:29:49,140 --> 01:29:51,098
- With my girlfriend, I'm...
- Don't.

1350
01:29:52,307 --> 01:29:53,616
Don't say more.

1351
01:29:53,640 --> 01:29:56,473
I just wanted to be sure
you wouldn't end up alone.

1352
01:31:12,598 --> 01:31:13,682
Nice to meet you.

1353
01:31:40,098 --> 01:31:42,640
"Girlfriend,"
did I hear you say earlier?

1354
01:31:45,140 --> 01:31:46,515
First I heard of it.

1355
01:31:48,307 --> 01:31:51,533
I can tell you,
now a new life's opening up to me...

1356
01:31:51,557 --> 01:31:54,533
At first, working here with you,

1357
01:31:54,557 --> 01:31:56,723
while we were getting divorced...

1358
01:31:59,390 --> 01:32:01,807
At times, you could've uprooted me.

1359
01:32:04,932 --> 01:32:08,390
Of course I thought,
"My girl, what's gotten into you?"

1360
01:32:22,515 --> 01:32:25,848
I was wondering
if you want to come to the coast with me.

1361
01:32:27,348 --> 01:32:29,158
See the guy over there?

1362
01:32:29,182 --> 01:32:31,783
He's waiting to take me away
for a few days.

1363
01:32:31,807 --> 01:32:34,283
Who knows, perhaps forever.

1364
01:32:34,307 --> 01:32:35,390
Enjoy it.

1365
01:32:43,390 --> 01:32:45,432
I very nearly fell for you again.

1366
01:32:48,223 --> 01:32:49,741
I really doubt that.

1367
01:32:49,765 --> 01:32:50,765
It's true.

1368
01:32:52,265 --> 01:32:56,783
If I'd known, when we were married,
all my sexual or relationship hangups

1369
01:32:56,807 --> 01:32:58,783
but I had no idea.

1370
01:32:58,807 --> 01:33:01,699
Now you know, it's all good.

1371
01:33:01,723 --> 01:33:03,991
With my boyfriend, this time,

1372
01:33:04,015 --> 01:33:06,366
things will be so different.

1373
01:33:06,390 --> 01:33:08,348
As obviously as I'm Joelle.

1374
01:33:11,182 --> 01:33:13,241
Perhaps, after the vacation,

1375
01:33:13,265 --> 01:33:15,408
you and I will both move in
with someone.

1376
01:33:15,432 --> 01:33:17,098
It'll be weird for the kids.

1377
01:33:18,390 --> 01:33:19,866
For sure, super weird.

1378
01:33:19,890 --> 01:33:22,616
Me, only perhaps. Nothing's sure.

1379
01:33:22,640 --> 01:33:23,866
Yes, it's sure.

1380
01:33:23,890 --> 01:33:25,533
- How'd you know?
- It's sure.

1381
01:33:25,557 --> 01:33:27,598
- I've lost my shoes.
- I'm on it.

1382
01:33:41,557 --> 01:33:42,932
Shoo mosquitoes.

1383
01:36:58,640 --> 01:36:59,973
So now it's...

1384
01:37:01,015 --> 01:37:02,223
two disguises?

1385
01:39:17,890 --> 01:39:19,658
Bob Marley sang that.

1386
01:39:19,682 --> 01:39:21,408
Our children, what will they sing?

1387
01:39:21,432 --> 01:39:23,241
You didn't give a single dollar.

1388
01:39:23,265 --> 01:39:25,182
You big jerk!

1389
01:39:27,098 --> 01:39:29,223
Calm down, little jerks.

1390
01:39:30,807 --> 01:39:32,199
You calm down!

1391
01:39:32,223 --> 01:39:35,533
You're a thief. I say it to your face!

1392
01:39:35,557 --> 01:39:38,241
They're getting away!

1393
01:39:38,265 --> 01:39:40,015
Shame on you!

1394
01:39:41,598 --> 01:39:42,723
Sons of bitches!

1395
01:39:53,807 --> 01:39:56,699
What did you mean earlier,
for me it's sure?

1396
01:39:56,723 --> 01:39:57,783
How come?

1397
01:39:57,807 --> 01:40:01,074
That after the vacation,
I'll move in with someone.

1398
01:40:01,098 --> 01:40:02,324
That?

1399
01:40:02,348 --> 01:40:04,616
I guess I can tell you.

1400
01:40:04,640 --> 01:40:05,658
I saw him.

1401
01:40:05,682 --> 01:40:08,324
- Who?
- Your suitor.

1402
01:40:08,348 --> 01:40:10,074
He came to see me.

1403
01:40:10,098 --> 01:40:13,765
He came to see you?
It sounds unlikely and unlike him.

1404
01:40:15,098 --> 01:40:17,199
Don't worry, I put him straight.

1405
01:40:17,223 --> 01:40:20,866
He's such a traditionalist,
soon you'll be Mrs. Poitard.

1406
01:40:20,890 --> 01:40:22,658
Mrs. Poitard?

1407
01:40:22,682 --> 01:40:24,491
- His name, isn't it?
- Sure.

1408
01:40:24,515 --> 01:40:26,033
- Poitard?
- Of course.

1409
01:40:26,057 --> 01:40:28,182
That's right. Nice guy.

1410
01:40:29,557 --> 01:40:31,824
- Handsome, right?
- In his way.

1411
01:40:31,848 --> 01:40:35,949
Don't get it into your head
to change him. Bad idea.

1412
01:40:35,973 --> 01:40:38,408
No diet, for example.

1413
01:40:38,432 --> 01:40:39,765
You'd say he's fat?

1414
01:40:41,265 --> 01:40:43,449
I like the spare tire. It's cute.

1415
01:40:43,473 --> 01:40:45,408
Why do I fight it?

1416
01:40:45,432 --> 01:40:46,616
It's reassuring.

1417
01:40:46,640 --> 01:40:49,366
After all we endured, what do we want?

1418
01:40:49,390 --> 01:40:50,390
Reassurance.

1419
01:40:51,432 --> 01:40:54,074
If I were a woman and I had the choice

1420
01:40:54,098 --> 01:40:56,991
between an unstable young guy...

1421
01:40:57,015 --> 01:40:59,324
and one of the national elite,

1422
01:40:59,348 --> 01:41:02,283
who cuts a dash
in a sharp suit and crisp shirt

1423
01:41:02,307 --> 01:41:05,116
with sky blue stripes
that are so classy,

1424
01:41:05,140 --> 01:41:10,033
and works for a defense contractor
as head of outsourcing...

1425
01:41:10,057 --> 01:41:11,366
it's a no-brainer.

1426
01:41:11,390 --> 01:41:13,723
Yes, I'd choose Gilbert Poitard.

1427
01:41:21,640 --> 01:41:23,949
Didn't you find him subtle?

1428
01:41:23,973 --> 01:41:25,991
With a remarkable sense of humor?

1429
01:41:26,015 --> 01:41:30,408
Sorry, but it's a fool's game
judging the sense of humor of a guy

1430
01:41:30,432 --> 01:41:33,723
convicted of harassment
at France Telecom.

1431
01:41:35,598 --> 01:41:39,473
And who's here putting out feelers
for the next elections.

1432
01:41:41,265 --> 01:41:43,866
However, thanks to me,

1433
01:41:43,890 --> 01:41:48,074
he knows how in touch you are
with the sensitivities of the inhabitants

1434
01:41:48,098 --> 01:41:50,324
of Montfermeil.
That grabbed his attention.

1435
01:41:50,348 --> 01:41:51,741
No kidding.

1436
01:41:51,765 --> 01:41:55,182
To manipulate people's minds,
their psyches...

1437
01:41:57,057 --> 01:41:59,199
I am completely revolted.

1438
01:41:59,223 --> 01:42:01,866
If you saw the things he wrote...

1439
01:42:01,890 --> 01:42:03,390
Such as? Tell me.

1440
01:42:05,223 --> 01:42:08,533
"Since you are, eternal heart,
the woman, and I know you."

1441
01:42:08,557 --> 01:42:13,074
"Fleeting wave carried on air,
elusive flame."

1442
01:42:13,098 --> 01:42:14,199
Apollinaire.

1443
01:42:14,223 --> 01:42:15,515
He even stole that.

1444
01:42:24,598 --> 01:42:27,283
I thought I'd found the perfect man.

1445
01:42:27,307 --> 01:42:29,199
And I went and destroyed it.

1446
01:42:29,223 --> 01:42:30,991
Yes.

1447
01:42:31,015 --> 01:42:33,682
Although I suppose I should thank you.

1448
01:42:35,348 --> 01:42:37,158
You know, Joelle,

1449
01:42:37,182 --> 01:42:41,699
if we had a heart-to-heart earlier,
things would be different.

1450
01:42:41,723 --> 01:42:43,783
We wouldn't have fought.

1451
01:42:43,807 --> 01:42:46,033
Or maybe we'd have fought,

1452
01:42:46,057 --> 01:42:49,991
but only about settling down
in Paris or out here.

1453
01:42:50,015 --> 01:42:53,140
I appreciate you
trying to cheer me up but...

1454
01:42:57,140 --> 01:42:58,515
It's pointless.

1455
01:43:06,182 --> 01:43:07,223
Sorry.

1456
01:43:17,015 --> 01:43:18,182
Know what I'd like?

1457
01:43:19,432 --> 01:43:22,741
Later, when your doorbell rings,
you open up,

1458
01:43:22,765 --> 01:43:24,557
and instead of Poitard...

1459
01:43:26,765 --> 01:43:28,182
I come in.

1460
01:43:29,682 --> 01:43:32,408
Stop making things more difficult.

1461
01:43:32,432 --> 01:43:33,616
I'd say,

1462
01:43:33,640 --> 01:43:37,908
Joelle, sweetheart,
I can't take any more.

1463
01:43:37,932 --> 01:43:40,908
Please, teleport to your island

1464
01:43:40,932 --> 01:43:42,949
and tell the Leopardess

1465
01:43:42,973 --> 01:43:44,723
to kiss me full on the mouth.

1466
01:43:54,015 --> 01:43:55,015
Can't be.

1467
01:43:57,140 --> 01:43:58,140
Can.

1468
01:44:02,848 --> 01:44:04,098
You're the Fox?

1469
01:44:22,848 --> 01:44:24,015
My sweet...

1470
01:44:27,765 --> 01:44:28,765
You ok?

1471
01:44:30,723 --> 01:44:32,848
Psychologically, very unsettled.

1472
01:44:36,640 --> 01:44:38,557
Feeling pretty good, actually.

1473
01:44:39,890 --> 01:44:41,640
Personally, I mean.
