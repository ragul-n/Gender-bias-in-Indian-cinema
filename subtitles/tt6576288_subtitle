3
00:01:27,187 --> 00:01:28,688
And then what happened?

4
00:01:28,688 --> 00:01:29,655
Tell me.

5
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:32,657
lf you keep asking me what
happened, there's nothing much.

6
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:34,486
This happens everywhere.

7
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:39,396
Did dad come here?
- There's a match today.

8
00:01:39,466 --> 00:01:41,134
Baiju Chettan went to play.
- Where?

9
00:01:41,134 --> 00:01:42,931
lt's quite far.
l don't know the place.

10
00:01:44,904 --> 00:01:47,998
Babita, come. Let's play.
- l don't have time now. There are guests at
home.

11
00:01:48,741 --> 00:01:50,834
The semi-final match
is in progress now.

12
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:53,746
What a wonderful batting!

13
00:01:53,746 --> 00:01:56,613
For Kumbalam Brothers, Hari
has scored a massive sixer!

14
00:01:56,716 --> 00:01:59,514
Kumbalam Brothers need
just 10 more runs to win!

15
00:01:59,586 --> 00:02:02,453
Their best batsman, Hari
continues at the crease.

16
00:02:02,722 --> 00:02:06,522
Kumbalam Brothers have a history
under the leadership of Baiju Kumbalam.

17
00:02:06,593 --> 00:02:07,961
Ya right! Everyone knows that.

18
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:10,196
We haven't won a single
tournament for the past 4 years.

19
00:02:10,196 --> 00:02:11,390
That's our history, right?

20
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:12,556
Then wait & watch!

21
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:15,965
lf we win today's tournament as well, it
will be the 100th cup under my captaincy.

22
00:02:16,436 --> 00:02:17,994
Stop bluffing, Baijuetta.

23
00:02:18,104 --> 00:02:20,004
l don't have to
convince you guys!

24
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,738
During my teenage, the district team..
- District team?

25
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:24,544
Stitch ball or soft ball?

26
00:02:24,544 --> 00:02:26,705
District team's selection camp.
Stitch ball!

27
00:02:26,913 --> 00:02:29,848
Back then, my batting style used to
be like that of DeVilliers right now.

28
00:02:30,116 --> 00:02:34,075
ln 36 balls, l scored 73 runs including 4
boundaries, 6 sixers & got out by LBW.

29
00:02:34,787 --> 00:02:35,913
The umpire cheated me.

30
00:02:36,022 --> 00:02:38,591
Otherwise, with my form back then, l
would've scored nothing short of a century.

31
00:02:38,591 --> 00:02:39,853
That's how awesome l was.

32
00:02:39,926 --> 00:02:42,759
Keep bragging! - How can you
brag like this without laughing, Baijuetta?

33
00:02:42,862 --> 00:02:44,564
l'm not bragging.
Why should l laugh then?

34
00:02:44,564 --> 00:02:45,758
And then what happened?

35
00:02:45,865 --> 00:02:47,765
There was a lot of politics there.

36
00:02:47,867 --> 00:02:49,027
And not because he wasn't good!

37
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:51,971
Baiju!

38
00:02:52,572 --> 00:02:53,773
Haven't you retired yet?

39
00:02:53,773 --> 00:02:56,105
These guys are very particular
that l should be the Captain.

40
00:02:56,609 --> 00:02:57,610
Captain?

41
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:59,168
lsn't there any age
limit forthat?

42
00:03:07,754 --> 00:03:09,688
He didn't have to
take that second run!

43
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,157
Shucks!

44
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:14,118
Only l am left to bat, right?
- Why did you lose your wicket?

45
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:16,094
Just 5 more runs were needed.
And there are 3 overs left.

46
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:17,254
Baijuettan, go ahead!

47
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:20,230
Baijuetta, just play defence.

48
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,995
Josemon will hit the
rest & win the match.

49
00:03:24,003 --> 00:03:26,105
We don't need 75 runs that you
scored for the district team.

50
00:03:26,105 --> 00:03:27,072
Just 5 runs.

51
00:03:28,508 --> 00:03:30,143
Baijuetta, careful.
Bat carefully.

52
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:31,144
Hey,

53
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:33,813
l've been playing with this
stick for 35 years now.

54
00:03:33,813 --> 00:03:35,041
Don't teach me how to play.

55
00:03:35,114 --> 00:03:37,275
With my experience,
l know how to play.

56
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,741
You monkeys don't have
respect for your Captain!

57
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:44,718
Oh Kumbalam Goddess!

58
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:47,060
Here comes Kumbalam
Brothers' next batsman,

59
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,688
Baijuetta, just score one run. l'll score the rest.
- Let me see.

60
00:03:49,762 --> 00:03:53,700
Kumbalam Brothers' Captain, with the
experience of 35 years, the veteran star;

61
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:54,667
Baiju!

62
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:56,302
Kumbalam Brothers' last man!

63
00:03:56,302 --> 00:03:57,269
Last wicket!

64
00:03:57,937 --> 00:03:59,564
Another interesting fact,

65
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:02,904
is that both the batsman and
the bowler have the same name.

66
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:03,943
Baiju!

67
00:04:04,043 --> 00:04:05,311
Baiju to Baiju!

68
00:04:05,311 --> 00:04:06,278
Wait!

69
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,613
Baiju to Baiju Kumbalam!

70
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:15,584
The undying excitement and
unshakeable trust of 20-20 cricket;

71
00:04:15,688 --> 00:04:18,122
Baiju Kumbalam is at the crease.

72
00:04:21,628 --> 00:04:23,687
Shucks! lf that had hit the bat,

73
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:26,630
we could have seen a beautiful sixer!

74
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:30,261
Ending this amazing
match on a high note,

75
00:04:30,336 --> 00:04:32,770
Baiju Kumbalam is clean bowled!

76
00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:38,578
Beating Kumbalam Brothers by 4 runs,

77
00:04:38,578 --> 00:04:39,545
Move.

78
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:41,307
Gramina Kalavedi has
qualified forthe finals!

79
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:42,746
Where did that ball go?

80
00:04:42,882 --> 00:04:45,652
- There's no one else to bat?
Baijuetta, didn't we ask you defend?

81
00:04:45,652 --> 00:04:46,949
Dude, it was technically perfect.

82
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:49,222
l tried to hook on front foot.
Timing was also correct.

83
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:51,087
But the bowler's timing went wrong.
- Ya right!

84
00:04:51,157 --> 00:04:53,760
Last time it was the umpire's fault.
- Enough. Where is Vineeth?

85
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,557
Vineeth & Unni are buying
gooseberries there.

86
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:56,720
Gooseberries?

87
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:57,785
Two for me!

88
00:04:57,864 --> 00:04:59,559
See how he escaped after
losing the match.

89
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:01,630
l'll change it for some time.

90
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:02,868
Vineeth!

91
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,998
Your butt is almost 5.5 kilos!

92
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:06,095
Can't you move it?

93
00:05:06,172 --> 00:05:08,106
What about beef fry?
- Sheesh!

94
00:05:08,174 --> 00:05:09,163
Ya! We won!

95
00:05:09,609 --> 00:05:11,133
l was 56, not out.
Ya.

96
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:15,144
Ya. And l do bowling mainly.
l took 4 wickets too.

97
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:17,750
Send me your pic first, Shyna.

98
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,719
Then l'll send my
trophy's pic on WhatsApp.

99
00:05:19,719 --> 00:05:20,720
You scumbag!

100
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,085
What?
- You & your pic!

101
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:24,282
l'm tensed that wejust lost
Rs.25,000 and you are..

102
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:26,018
lt's because Baiju
Annan wasn't in form.

103
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:28,093
Or we could have won
the cup easily!

104
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:29,762
When has he ever been in form?

105
00:05:29,762 --> 00:05:31,230
He just plays once in a blue moon.

106
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:32,197
Hey!

107
00:05:32,298 --> 00:05:35,028
Blaming the Captain after losing
the game, is not good team spirit.

108
00:05:35,802 --> 00:05:37,133
lsn't that our patron?

109
00:05:37,203 --> 00:05:39,137
Why are you here, Baijuetta?
- Hey!

110
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,441
Since there is a talk that

111
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:44,205
Kumbalam Brothers haven't won
a cup in the past 4 years,

112
00:05:45,244 --> 00:05:47,212
going back to town saying
that we lost again,

113
00:05:47,313 --> 00:05:49,144
would be an insult to
our sportsman spirit.

114
00:05:50,717 --> 00:05:51,706
l'll slap you!

115
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:55,353
Not just that, l challenged Vilasan
that we will win the trophy.

116
00:05:55,421 --> 00:05:56,615
That's usual.

117
00:05:56,723 --> 00:05:58,350
Vilasan will always be
there at the junction.

118
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:00,956
So how will go home with
our heads held high?

119
00:06:01,894 --> 00:06:03,122
Did any of you think about it?

120
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:06,626
That's where Captain
Baiju Kumbalam comes in.

121
00:06:08,167 --> 00:06:09,134
See!

122
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:11,434
What if it was expensive,

123
00:06:11,671 --> 00:06:12,899
it's an awesome trophy, right?

124
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,008
With this,

125
00:06:16,175 --> 00:06:19,338
have a huge celebration at the junction.
Okay?

126
00:06:19,445 --> 00:06:21,709
Salutes! Salutes!
- Not now, man!

127
00:06:21,814 --> 00:06:28,777
Team DrC

128
00:06:29,155 --> 00:06:30,179
Vilasan Chetta,

129
00:06:30,256 --> 00:06:32,315
We won the cup!
- Did you win it or steal it?

130
00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:33,449
Hey! Plug the mike in!

131
00:06:33,793 --> 00:06:35,283
Captain has to give
permission forthat.

132
00:06:35,361 --> 00:06:38,194
Oh. You'll listen
only to the Captain!

133
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:40,697
Son, l've been plugging this
in for a long time now.

134
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:43,160
l'll do it only if
Captain asks me to.

135
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:47,173
- Hail Baiju Kumbalam!

136
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:48,731
- Thank you! Thank you!

137
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:51,301
Plug the mike in.

138
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:54,912
Baijuetta, allow the new
generation to grow. Give it!

139
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:56,312
l won't give the mike.
- What about Captaincy?

140
00:06:56,382 --> 00:06:58,384
l won't give that too!
-Aren't you ashamed?

141
00:06:58,384 --> 00:07:00,716
To play around with
these kids even now?

142
00:07:00,787 --> 00:07:01,981
Aren't you too old for this?

143
00:07:02,054 --> 00:07:05,324
You're still not ashamed to wear this
even though you're so old, right?

144
00:07:05,324 --> 00:07:06,757
The same old receipt book.

145
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:07,994
The same old hogging;

146
00:07:07,994 --> 00:07:09,689
The same old money swindling..

147
00:07:09,962 --> 00:07:12,331
For those who look only for profit
in anything and everything;

148
00:07:12,331 --> 00:07:15,198
at least to remember about their
childhood & feel emotional,

149
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:16,502
there should be a
board like that!

150
00:07:16,502 --> 00:07:17,764
'Can't forget our Kumbalam'

151
00:07:17,837 --> 00:07:19,896
Forthat, there should be a
Baiju Kumbalam like this.

152
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:24,241
That is Baiju Kumbalam's
political & cultural relevance.

153
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:27,311
Can you tell me about your
political & cultural relevance?

154
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:31,009
See! This is why l get
to speak on the mike.

155
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:33,880
My dear sports lovers,

156
00:07:34,353 --> 00:07:36,823
The pride of Kumbalam
- Kumbalam Brothers;

157
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:40,359
l am extremely happy to inform you that
we have a won a cup from another town,

158
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:41,883
under my captaincy.

159
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:46,430
Dude, l can't take this
trophy to my house.

160
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:47,727
Keep it in your house.

161
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,894
And tomorrow morning, put it in a nice
bag & take it without anyone noticing.

162
00:07:51,204 --> 00:07:52,762
Do you have any
nice bags at home?

163
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:54,373
l have one. But it's slightly torn.

164
00:07:54,373 --> 00:07:55,431
That can't be used.

165
00:07:55,508 --> 00:07:57,999
lf Vilasan sees this inside that,
it will be a shame for us!

166
00:07:58,511 --> 00:08:00,445
Mix some sugar into it.

167
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:02,140
lt won't be that bitter then.

168
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:03,482
- Ya right!

169
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,550
Did you have lunch?

170
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:06,341
Lunch? Do you know
what time is it now?

171
00:08:08,354 --> 00:08:09,321
What is this?
A trophy?

172
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:11,046
Did you win? Or..
- We lost!

173
00:08:12,058 --> 00:08:13,286
We have to return it tomorrow.

174
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:15,421
Baiju, aren't you ashamed?

175
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:18,023
You are the one who's
spoiling the kids here.

176
00:08:18,097 --> 00:08:19,462
What kind of an allegation is that?

177
00:08:19,565 --> 00:08:21,465
He has a PSC test on
the coming Saturday.

178
00:08:21,968 --> 00:08:24,070
Ask him if he has studied anything!
Playing all the time!

179
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,905
l'm not going to get
a job by studying.

180
00:08:25,905 --> 00:08:27,429
Those who don't study
are getting jobs now.

181
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:28,508
That's true.

182
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:31,341
l'm in the water authority. Why should
l know the height of Qutub Minar?.

183
00:08:32,111 --> 00:08:33,373
After writing the PSC test,

184
00:08:33,446 --> 00:08:35,914
l want to join a department where
there's no work, like you.

185
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:37,116
Surendran Chetta,
l'm leaving.

186
00:08:37,116 --> 00:08:38,378
l haven't had lunch.
l'm really hungry.

187
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:39,941
You can have lunch here.

188
00:08:40,052 --> 00:08:41,349
We have snake-head
fish curry here.

189
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,887
Ya. lt's fantastic.
Have it. Your tongue will go bland!

190
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,021
Whatever l make, you
find fault with it.

191
00:08:46,092 --> 00:08:49,195
You can't keep calm unless you
find some reason to start a fight!

192
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,823
Keep talking. l don't even
bother about it anymore.

193
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:54,229
Shall l leave?
- That's why the curry is always like this!

194
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,899
Mom, serve lunch for me.

195
00:08:56,068 --> 00:08:58,604
You've been fishing since morning and
you could catch only a snake-head?

196
00:08:58,604 --> 00:09:00,231
You just come to eat it when
it's time for lunch, right?

197
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,206
lf you take your textbook
& go fishing at the lake,

198
00:09:03,276 --> 00:09:05,210
you'll get fish and clear
the PSC test as well!

199
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:06,572
What are you doing?

200
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:09,305
Here.
Tie this.

201
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:12,311
So much love!

202
00:09:12,418 --> 00:09:13,612
Ya right!
Love!

203
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:16,080
lf you catch a cold, even l would get it.
That's why!

204
00:09:16,656 --> 00:09:21,616
Team DrC

205
00:09:22,461 --> 00:09:24,088
Mom!
Dad is here.

206
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:25,828
Why are you shouting?

207
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:27,262
When did you leave today?

208
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:31,136
Dad is here.

209
00:09:32,138 --> 00:09:33,105
He is back?

210
00:09:36,108 --> 00:09:37,200
Who is in the kitchen?

211
00:09:37,276 --> 00:09:38,470
lt's me, mom!
- You came back?

212
00:09:38,544 --> 00:09:40,011
Why didn't you call me?

213
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,072
Won't l serve it for you?

214
00:09:42,348 --> 00:09:43,645
You were washing clothes, right?

215
00:09:44,183 --> 00:09:46,048
Did my in-laws leave?

216
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:47,486
Then what?

217
00:09:47,653 --> 00:09:49,587
You left early in the
morning on a Sunday!

218
00:09:50,122 --> 00:09:51,316
Do you have any responsibility?

219
00:09:52,124 --> 00:09:53,921
You're still playing
around like a kid!

220
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,588
Aren't you ashamed?

221
00:09:56,028 --> 00:09:59,020
And we are the ones who
feel so embarrassed.

222
00:10:02,134 --> 00:10:03,465
Vipin, who's studying
with Babita;

223
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:05,271
ls he playing cricket
with you now?

224
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:06,363
Give me a Pappadam.

225
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:12,477
l'll die.
l'll commit suicide.

226
00:10:12,678 --> 00:10:13,645
Wait & watch!

227
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:19,940
Done?

228
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:22,321
For how many years have
you been advising me?

229
00:10:22,388 --> 00:10:24,253
Have l changed?
No, right?

230
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:26,192
Then why are you going
on and on again?

231
00:10:26,192 --> 00:10:27,159
Right, mom?

232
00:10:27,226 --> 00:10:28,454
Janaki!
- Yes!

233
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:30,420
Where did dad go, mom?

234
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:32,698
The strike for
pension is going on.

235
00:10:32,698 --> 00:10:34,461
They're protesting in front of KSRTC.

236
00:10:38,938 --> 00:10:41,600
When the income we're
getting suddenly stops,

237
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:44,340
whom do l talk to, about the panic
that happens in the family?

238
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:47,475
l'm going for strikes and
protests at this old age..

239
00:10:47,546 --> 00:10:49,207
Dad, the earring l
had asked for..

240
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:50,906
l want it forthe
function at school.

241
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:52,017
l'll buy it!

242
00:10:53,185 --> 00:10:54,482
Don't fool me later, okay?

243
00:10:54,687 --> 00:10:57,212
Have l ever fooled you without buying
something that l promised you?

244
00:10:57,289 --> 00:10:58,483
l'll buy it.
Okay?

245
00:10:59,258 --> 00:11:00,190
Hey.

246
00:11:01,093 --> 00:11:03,186
A notice has come from the
Co-Operative bank.

247
00:11:03,696 --> 00:11:06,187
We have to repay the balance of
the loan within this month.

248
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,194
l'll get my PF loan this week.
- ls it?

249
00:11:08,968 --> 00:11:10,196
l'll go have a bath.

250
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,061
You will be here, right?
- Yes.

251
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:19,939
Oops.
lt's 4.30?

252
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:22,347
Baijuetta!

253
00:11:26,218 --> 00:11:27,515
Where are you taking it?

254
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,746
There's some nice green
grass over there.

255
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:31,215
lt doesn't eat grass now.

256
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:32,655
lt isn't your rule here.

257
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:34,352
Let me give this to it.

258
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,050
lt's not thirsty now!

259
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:37,229
Come!

260
00:11:37,296 --> 00:11:38,263
Come!

261
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:39,626
Just to fight with the children!

262
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:40,757
What's wrong with you?

263
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,729
Throw fast!
lt's getting late.

264
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:46,539
What are you collecting money for now?
- You aren't going to pay anyway, right?

265
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:47,606
l may give it!

266
00:11:47,606 --> 00:11:48,766
Ya! 10 Rupees.

267
00:11:49,008 --> 00:11:50,441
And you'll ask 100
questions for that!

268
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:56,615
Hey kids!

269
00:11:57,583 --> 00:11:59,380
l'm growing spinach there.

270
00:11:59,518 --> 00:12:01,620
lf you stamp on it, you'll
see my true colours!

271
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,315
What's left to see?

272
00:12:03,422 --> 00:12:05,049
l think he's crazy!

273
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:09,428
Jose!

274
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:10,655
Cheenu, don't go alone.

275
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,754
Cheenu, l'll come and take it.

276
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:16,492
Why can't he tie it
in his own backyard?

277
00:12:20,539 --> 00:12:21,540
Alwin Etta,

278
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,269
lf we ask those brothers, they'll get it.

279
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:24,376
Bro!

280
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:25,799
Hi.
l am Rohit.

281
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:27,747
Hello.
- l am Asif.

282
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:30,683
They've started constructing a flat
at the ground we used to play in.

283
00:12:30,683 --> 00:12:32,583
Many are going to
Meppara ground.

284
00:12:32,651 --> 00:12:34,312
But it's too far from our house.

285
00:12:34,553 --> 00:12:37,223
So, can we join you guys here?

286
00:12:37,223 --> 00:12:38,224
Hari!

287
00:12:38,224 --> 00:12:40,292
We'll decide that after Baijuettan comes.
Come here.

288
00:12:40,292 --> 00:12:41,259
What?

289
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,089
Our ball is near that cow.

290
00:12:43,162 --> 00:12:45,153
Can you get it back, Manojettan?
-After this ball.

291
00:12:45,664 --> 00:12:47,222
Move!
- 3rd ball.

292
00:12:52,304 --> 00:12:54,772
l'll go get that ball.
You get these kids' ball.

293
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:57,508
Don't hit the ball there very often!
Okay?

294
00:12:58,444 --> 00:12:59,706
Bro! Ball.
- What?

295
00:13:00,146 --> 00:13:01,272
Hey Moosakka!

296
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,315
Where's that old flame of yours?

297
00:13:03,315 --> 00:13:05,818
Sheesh! Are you so jobless?

298
00:13:05,818 --> 00:13:07,520
A lot of things happen
during childhood.

299
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,511
Why do you have to bring
it up at this age?

300
00:13:15,227 --> 00:13:16,194
Rose,

301
00:13:16,428 --> 00:13:18,487
can't you play ring
throw with Sara?

302
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:20,054
She is playing there.

303
00:13:20,566 --> 00:13:25,196
''lf l see her smile,
that's enough for me'

304
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:26,800
Have you heard this Tamil song?

305
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:28,663
lt's not Tamil.
lt's a Malayalam song.

306
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:29,808
lt's Malayalam?

307
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,538
- Hey Manoj!

308
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:33,612
Coming!

309
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:52,521
lf this ball comes here again,

310
00:13:52,698 --> 00:13:53,892
l will set it on fire!

311
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:55,794
Kamala, get me that broom.

312
00:13:56,135 --> 00:13:58,865
Let me sweep all that waste
& put their ball in it..

313
00:14:05,945 --> 00:14:06,912
Altaf Etta,

314
00:14:07,146 --> 00:14:08,514
can l also play cricket with you?

315
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:09,481
l bowl well.

316
00:14:09,548 --> 00:14:11,607
Before playing with us, let
your moustache grow a bit.

317
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:19,925
Vidya,

318
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:21,453
don't go near the cow.

319
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:22,755
lt will kick you.
- Okay.

320
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:27,626
Throw it that side!

321
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:30,197
No! No! l reached!

322
00:14:30,502 --> 00:14:31,901
l reached before he stumped.

323
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:33,539
lsn't the crease correct?

324
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:34,528
Keep the stumps back.

325
00:14:34,607 --> 00:14:35,631
Properly!
Come on!

326
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:40,904
Baijuetta, you were out four
times in this over itself!

327
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,709
Check the crease.
l've measured it.

328
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:43,907
Okay. Draw it correctly.

329
00:14:44,316 --> 00:14:45,613
Correctly.
- Check it.

330
00:14:48,587 --> 00:14:50,817
l crossed it earlier.
- He is not out!

331
00:14:51,423 --> 00:14:53,792
Didn't you hear him? lt's correct!
- Vineeth, shut up!

332
00:14:53,792 --> 00:14:54,952
He saw it!

333
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:56,658
Come on!
Bowl again!

334
00:14:58,931 --> 00:14:59,955
LBW!

335
00:15:00,332 --> 00:15:02,300
No LBW!

336
00:15:02,868 --> 00:15:04,529
lf there's an umpire,
there will be LBW.

337
00:15:04,603 --> 00:15:05,900
No LBW.
There's no umpire, right?

338
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:08,907
Six!

339
00:15:09,508 --> 00:15:10,600
Correct shot!

340
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:12,278
You are in great form today!

341
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:14,371
l didn't get the shot l planned.
But it's okay.

342
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,447
Hey! Hey!

343
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:16,515
l'll go.

344
00:15:16,515 --> 00:15:17,482
What?

345
00:15:17,549 --> 00:15:19,483
You haven't reached the
age to check out girls.

346
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:21,286
Got it!

347
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:25,621
How long have we been waiting?

348
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:27,493
What do l do?
l should find the ball, right?

349
00:15:27,493 --> 00:15:29,256
Don't waste time.
l'll lose my form.

350
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:30,295
Bowl!

351
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:32,898
Don't catch it!

352
00:15:36,502 --> 00:15:37,628
29..

353
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:39,804
- 29..
- What's the score now?

354
00:15:43,676 --> 00:15:45,940
She has come to play ring
throw because l asked her to.

355
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:47,646
Catch!

356
00:15:47,746 --> 00:15:49,646
Manoj!
- You won't even see it. That's my shot!

357
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:50,849
Another six!

358
00:15:53,385 --> 00:15:54,386
Go get it!

359
00:15:54,386 --> 00:15:56,877
lf it goes to the bushes, the one who
hit it has to get it. l won't take it!

360
00:15:56,989 --> 00:15:59,389
l can't hit every ball to the
village officer's house!

361
00:15:59,725 --> 00:16:00,919
Hey! You go get it!

362
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,994
Very sorry!
l went yesterday too!

363
00:16:03,062 --> 00:16:04,930
Let someone else go today.
- l'll get it.

364
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:06,659
No! You wait.
l'll go.

365
00:16:07,933 --> 00:16:09,958
Such attitude for all you guys.
l'll go get it.

366
00:16:10,869 --> 00:16:13,429
First thing you should learn in
cricket is to obey the Captain.

367
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:15,708
We don't win tournaments
because you don't do that! Got it?

368
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:18,370
Shall we declare out if you hit
it to the bushes? - No need!

369
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:21,638
Sheesh!

370
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:27,375
That crazy Kuttan doesn't learn!
He has shat all over the place!

371
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:28,754
That's not enough for
how much he eats.

372
00:16:28,754 --> 00:16:30,381
When l stamped on it,
what did you say?

373
00:16:30,522 --> 00:16:32,353
That he is a dumb
nature-lover, right?

374
00:16:32,524 --> 00:16:33,491
Suffer now!

375
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:35,688
Sot it's not out if you
hit to the bushes?

376
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:36,728
lt's out!

377
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,097
Let me wash my feet.

378
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:39,564
Don't come here.
lt's stinking!

379
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:43,026
Since Baijuettan was in
form, you guys escaped.

380
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:45,370
lt's okay. We will
get back tomorrow.

381
00:16:45,738 --> 00:16:48,298
Anyway, by next week, Altaf's
fate would be sealed!

382
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,441
Why?

383
00:16:49,441 --> 00:16:51,807
Most people retire from cricket
when they get married, right?

384
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:53,411
Ya right!

385
00:16:53,545 --> 00:16:56,070
Even after marriage, your lkka
will be active! Leave that!

386
00:16:56,315 --> 00:16:57,750
Anilettan also said
the same thing.

387
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,911
Then he didn't even come for
the club's anniversary.

388
00:16:59,985 --> 00:17:01,418
That's where Baijuettan
is different.

389
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,715
He will always be here at
this ground, to play with us.

390
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:06,548
Bye, dude. l'm leaving.
- Okay. Bye.

391
00:17:07,593 --> 00:17:09,959
Baijuetta, aren't you coming to eat?

392
00:17:11,764 --> 00:17:12,856
lt's getting dark.

393
00:17:12,965 --> 00:17:14,933
Rest tomorrow.
All of you leave. Take the ball.

394
00:17:16,602 --> 00:17:17,603
Hey!

395
00:17:17,603 --> 00:17:18,570
l'm leaving.

396
00:17:18,937 --> 00:17:20,063
Bye.
- Here's the ball.

397
00:17:21,006 --> 00:17:23,975
l have to go back home in the dress l
wore to the office in the morning.

398
00:17:24,676 --> 00:17:26,007
All this is an adjustment.

399
00:17:26,478 --> 00:17:28,380
Won't you come home tomorrow morning?

400
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,915
l have to buy some
stuff from the city.

401
00:17:29,915 --> 00:17:30,939
l'm not free till 11 AM.

402
00:17:31,016 --> 00:17:32,779
l have a trip to
Baijuettan's house.

403
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:35,120
lt's not for Baijuettan, dear.

404
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,644
lt's for my father Balakrishnan.

405
00:17:36,989 --> 00:17:39,617
That means you have to get
the cash from him directly.

406
00:17:39,691 --> 00:17:40,988
- Shall we have a lime soda?

407
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,052
Aren't you going home?

408
00:17:43,128 --> 00:17:44,163
l can't go home.

409
00:17:44,163 --> 00:17:45,130
Why?

410
00:17:45,364 --> 00:17:47,696
l ate Parotta & beef for the
money they gave me to buy fish.

411
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:53,399
No. l'll buy fish for you.
Hop on.

412
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:55,096
No need of fish then.
Let's buy chicken.

413
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,577
'The Little Elephant' is here.

414
00:18:00,045 --> 00:18:01,808
'The Little Elephant'

415
00:18:04,016 --> 00:18:06,919
Unniyetta, can you move it
a little more backwards?

416
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:07,943
No. This is enough!

417
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:11,521
Then come.
Let's do it together.

418
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:12,557
Move!

419
00:18:13,492 --> 00:18:15,551
There are so many young
men in this town!

420
00:18:15,627 --> 00:18:16,685
And you found only me?

421
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:18,163
lt's my true love.

422
00:18:18,163 --> 00:18:19,926
l can't go behind random guys!

423
00:18:19,998 --> 00:18:21,090
True love it seems!

424
00:18:23,001 --> 00:18:23,968
Open it.

425
00:18:25,804 --> 00:18:26,771
Hey, please.

426
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:28,874
People have started talking.

427
00:18:28,874 --> 00:18:30,569
lt's the publicity
that l'm giving.

428
00:18:30,642 --> 00:18:31,734
What?
- Publicity!

429
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:36,304
Team DrC

430
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:38,416
l want a fair & beautiful wife.

431
00:18:38,817 --> 00:18:39,977
Not someone like you!

432
00:18:40,686 --> 00:18:41,653
That's okay.

433
00:18:42,488 --> 00:18:43,455
What's okay?

434
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:45,683
l have made offerings to the temple
for you to change your mind.

435
00:18:45,757 --> 00:18:47,054
l believe my Goddess.

436
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:49,151
Oh God!
- How was the bride you went to meet
yesterday?

437
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:50,395
Will it happen?

438
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:52,197
You don't have to worry about it.

439
00:18:52,197 --> 00:18:54,563
When it's time, l'll give
you sweets and announce it.

440
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:56,034
When it happens?
Sweets?

441
00:18:56,034 --> 00:18:57,035
Let's see!

442
00:18:57,035 --> 00:18:58,400
l became a little late.

443
00:18:58,871 --> 00:19:00,930
You're becoming
little late daily!

444
00:19:05,777 --> 00:19:07,176
Are you coming?
ls she coming?

445
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:08,446
She is coming!

446
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:11,544
Do one thing. Deliver the stuff,
drop her back here and go.

447
00:19:14,453 --> 00:19:15,420
Move!

448
00:19:16,922 --> 00:19:18,219
Not this side.
That side.

449
00:19:23,896 --> 00:19:26,091
Baijuetta!
Where did you keep the bag?

450
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,861
l've taken the bag & tiffin!

451
00:19:32,804 --> 00:19:34,965
- Mom, where is my slide?
- Check nearthe mirror.

452
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,007
Hey!

453
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:38,005
When you get the provident fund..

454
00:19:38,076 --> 00:19:40,112
Mom, l'll get the provident
fund only when l retire.

455
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:42,478
This is also a loan.
- Don't you want your instrument box?

456
00:19:42,548 --> 00:19:43,981
Okay. Tell me.
What do you want?

457
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:45,482
Oh! l don't want anything.

458
00:19:45,551 --> 00:19:46,540
ls it wrong to talk?

459
00:19:46,785 --> 00:19:47,752
Grandma, bye!

460
00:19:49,621 --> 00:19:51,521
Don't forget to buy
those earrings for me!

461
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:59,164
Don't throw it!

462
00:20:00,132 --> 00:20:02,999
Sharada chechi, l've become more
flexible by dodging from this everyday.

463
00:20:03,068 --> 00:20:05,002
Can't you do this before
everyone comes to office?

464
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:07,834
You're teaching me responsibility
after coming to office at 11 AM?

465
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,735
Nobody is irresponsible here.

466
00:20:09,908 --> 00:20:11,535
There's not much work
in the department.

467
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:14,204
So l'll be a little late to come, and
l'll leave early in the evening.

468
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:28,955
Suku Sir,
- Ya. Tell me.

00:20:29,294 --> 00:20:30,295

- Yes Baiju Sir.

Then come here.

00:20:41,139 --> 00:20:42,163
Can l encash it today?

478
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:43,936

479
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:45,533
Thank you, Sir.
- Okay.

480
00:20:49,047 --> 00:20:50,014
Shucks!

481
00:20:50,782 --> 00:20:51,749
Lost?

482
00:20:52,017 --> 00:20:53,018
Which level?

483
00:20:53,018 --> 00:20:53,985
Level 2.

484
00:20:54,052 --> 00:20:55,187
Spiderman, right?

485
00:20:55,187 --> 00:20:56,154
Yup!

486
00:20:56,221 --> 00:20:57,586
lt's been 3-4 months now!

487
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:02,126
What is it?

488
00:21:02,194 --> 00:21:03,821
How many times do l tell

00:21:03,895 --> 00:21:06,598
l've got selection in the college team.
Can't you hear me?

490
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:07,724
College team selection?
- Yes.

00:21:07,866 --> 00:21:09,163
l need a cricket kit.

492
00:21:09,635 --> 00:21:10,693
lf you need a cricket kit,

493
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:12,337
ask your dad 'lnterest' Bhaskaran!

494
00:21:12,337 --> 00:21:13,304
Not me!

495
00:21:13,572 --> 00:21:15,301
lf l ask dad, you know, right?

496
00:21:15,674 --> 00:21:17,801
The camp is about to start.
- l understood that.

497
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:19,568
When?
- From tomorrow.

498
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:20,745
Tomorrow?

499
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:22,173
So you have to buy it today!

500
00:21:22,314 --> 00:21:24,282
Can you adjust some
cash for me, Baijuetta?

501
00:21:24,349 --> 00:21:26,010
Where will l have money from?

502
00:21:26,151 --> 00:21:27,743
Do you have any option?

503
00:21:27,819 --> 00:21:28,786
What option?

504
00:21:28,887 --> 00:21:30,115
lt's a golden chance!

505
00:21:31,657 --> 00:21:34,125
How much does it cost?
-Around 1 7,000.

506
00:21:34,192 --> 00:21:35,193
How much?

507
00:21:35,193 --> 00:21:36,854
- 1 7,000.
- Get lost, man!

508

00:21:38,196 --> 00:21:39,720
Baijuetta!
Hello!

510
00:21:39,898 --> 00:21:41,593
1 7,000 for a cricket kit?

511
00:21:46,204 --> 00:21:48,001
How do they even play
wearing all this?

512
00:21:49,341 --> 00:21:50,672
l feel like a robot now.

513
00:21:54,946 --> 00:21:55,947
Hari,
- Yes.

514
00:21:55,947 --> 00:21:58,040
l can't take photos on this.
Click one on your phone.

515
00:21:58,884 --> 00:21:59,851
Like this.

516
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,086
Got it?
- Yes.

517
00:22:08,427 --> 00:22:09,951
Sir, shall l pack this?

518
00:22:10,062 --> 00:22:11,256
Not now.
Remove it.

519
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:14,992
After buying all this, will you
be selected to the college team?

520
00:22:15,067 --> 00:22:16,401
l'm already in the college team.

521
00:22:16,401 --> 00:22:18,198
l adjusted with
my friends' kits.

522
00:22:18,937 --> 00:22:21,239
The coaching camp starts tomorrow.
Ranji team's selection.

523
00:22:21,239 --> 00:22:22,808
Any chance to get
selected for that?

524
00:22:22,808 --> 00:22:24,867
Can't say. l'm in
good form now anyway.

525
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:26,302
l would get it mostly.

526
00:22:26,945 --> 00:22:29,379
When we grow up, parents
don't love us as much.

527
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:30,415
Right, Baijuetta?

528
00:22:30,782 --> 00:22:32,409
Son, you can be emotional.

529
00:22:32,818 --> 00:22:35,287
But if you tell anyone that
l bought this for you,

530
00:22:35,287 --> 00:22:36,914
Secret is always...

531
00:22:36,988 --> 00:22:37,955
Okay bro.

532
00:22:39,057 --> 00:22:41,150
l have to go to the
Co-Operative Bank.

533
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,125
You carry on.
- Okay bro.

534
00:22:43,929 --> 00:22:44,896
Pack this.

535
00:22:44,996 --> 00:22:46,258
l'll be at the kids' section.

536
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:56,398
Ettan!
(Elder brother)

537
00:23:02,247 --> 00:23:03,214
Etta!

538
00:23:17,462 --> 00:23:19,692
How come you bought a Sari
today, all of a sudden?

539
00:23:20,298 --> 00:23:21,993
We have to go for
Altafs wedding, right?

540
00:23:22,834 --> 00:23:24,324
Didn't you buy 2 Saris for Onam?

541
00:23:24,469 --> 00:23:26,138
l have kept one of
them aside for that.

542
00:23:26,138 --> 00:23:27,435
ls this good?
Did you like it?

543
00:23:30,175 --> 00:23:31,164
lt's nice.

544
00:23:31,276 --> 00:23:32,243
But..

545
00:23:32,811 --> 00:23:33,778
this border..

546
00:23:33,845 --> 00:23:35,813
if it was violet, it
would,ve been even better.

547
00:23:37,115 --> 00:23:39,310
When you go to buy a Sari, l
can also come along, right?

548
00:23:39,851 --> 00:23:44,322
This is why the men who try to make
women happy are considered to be fools.

549
00:23:44,322 --> 00:23:45,323
Right?

550
00:23:45,323 --> 00:23:46,790
Why?
- That's how it is.

551
00:23:47,192 --> 00:23:48,159
Dad!

552
00:23:48,727 --> 00:23:49,694
So nice!

553
00:23:49,895 --> 00:23:52,164
Wear this for the programme at school.
lt will be awesome!

554
00:23:52,164 --> 00:23:54,189
The dress is awesome,
but l have to change my earrings.

555
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:56,427
These earrings are good, dear.
Why do you want to change it?

556
00:23:56,501 --> 00:23:58,799
l don't want to change them.
l will keep these too.

557
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:03,741
But the designs you wanted are not
available at the jewellery in the city.

558
00:24:04,042 --> 00:24:06,178
They are saying that
it is a Dubai design.

559
00:24:06,178 --> 00:24:08,806
Your friend's dad is in Dubai, right?
They might have bought it from there.

560
00:24:09,047 --> 00:24:10,344
- You went to the jewellery?

561
00:24:10,415 --> 00:24:12,383
l will also come to
buy the earrings.

562
00:24:12,884 --> 00:24:14,044
l didn't go there to buy.

563
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:15,877
l just went to check it out.

564
00:24:16,188 --> 00:24:17,780
We can buy it when
we get the PF loan.

565
00:24:18,523 --> 00:24:21,788
Since it's a Dubai model,
they have to import it.

566
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,327
So,

567
00:24:23,829 --> 00:24:24,989
they need one month.

568
00:24:25,363 --> 00:24:26,565
So l placed an order,

569
00:24:26,565 --> 00:24:27,930
and paid Rs.5000 as advance.

570
00:24:28,266 --> 00:24:30,496
Did you pay?
l can't wait for a month.

571
00:24:30,569 --> 00:24:32,059
We can buy another design.

572
00:24:32,237 --> 00:24:35,229
lf we buy it from that shop,
they will give us discounts.

573
00:24:35,507 --> 00:24:37,805
We will go together and buy it.
That will be better.

574
00:24:40,045 --> 00:24:41,012
Baijuetta,

575
00:24:41,847 --> 00:24:44,008
Are black-beaded
chains in fashion now?

576
00:24:45,851 --> 00:24:46,818
Hello!

577
00:24:48,019 --> 00:24:49,543
When did he fall?
He didn't tell me!

578
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:51,789
He escaped!

579
00:24:55,527 --> 00:24:57,552
Where you running off
to, in such a hurry?

580
00:24:57,796 --> 00:24:59,064
Where are you going?

581
00:24:59,064 --> 00:25:02,056
lf black-beaded chains are in fashion,
l can't stay upstairs, right?

582
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:06,433
What do we do, if you
can't get the PF loan?

583
00:25:06,905 --> 00:25:07,894
l got the loan, dad!

584
00:25:07,973 --> 00:25:09,207
Huh? You got it?

585
00:25:09,207 --> 00:25:11,232
You said that you didn't get
it when l asked earlier?

586
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:13,436
Well, l couldn't buy
earrings for Babitha.

587
00:25:13,578 --> 00:25:14,840
l didn't want them to know.

588
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,047
Okay.

589
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:19,217
And l've repaid the balance
amount at the bank.

590
00:25:19,217 --> 00:25:21,344
You hadn't calculated
the interest though.

591
00:25:21,419 --> 00:25:22,386
l did!

592
00:25:22,454 --> 00:25:24,479
Since you missed the
dates, the total interest.

593
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:27,549
But l paid that too.

594
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,988
That tension of yours is gone now, right?
- l'm happy.

595
00:25:31,062 --> 00:25:33,394
l will give you the accounts.
- l don't need that!

596
00:25:33,598 --> 00:25:36,066
l'm so relieved!
lt's over finally!

597
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:40,599
ln the press meet, minister said that
he will solve the pension issue soon.

598
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:42,466
That's a relief for me now.

599
00:25:43,975 --> 00:25:45,806
Anyway, l will keep the
accounts on your table.

600
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:47,902
Check it when you get time.
You can be aware, right?

601
00:25:53,585 --> 00:25:55,153
My own dad is fooling me!

602
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:02,353
'Love, like grape wine'

603
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:05,992
'A fresh & beautiful lotus bud'

604
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:11,024
'What are you saying,
blinking your Kohl-lined eyes?'

605
00:26:11,136 --> 00:26:15,073
'Your groom is waiting
for you this night'

606
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:18,338
'Love, like grape wine'

607
00:26:19,277 --> 00:26:22,474
'A fresh & beautiful lotus bud'

608
00:26:22,614 --> 00:26:24,912
Vineeth, stop eating
and get the Biriyani!

609
00:26:29,354 --> 00:26:33,085
Hey! Do it carefully!

610
00:26:33,158 --> 00:26:35,092
Let the water boil.

611
00:26:35,293 --> 00:26:42,665
'A gathering adorned in silk, with lovely
music all around, wearing anklets of mischief

612
00:26:45,136 --> 00:26:46,194
Hey, just get up!

613
00:26:46,404 --> 00:26:50,636
'A gathering with the fragrance of Biriyani,
where the breeze is floating around happily'

614
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:57,048
'With innocent minds and joy all around;
for kids this is their world'

615
00:26:57,048 --> 00:26:58,174
Hey! Over here!

616
00:26:58,249 --> 00:26:59,944
Hey! Give it to him!

617
00:27:01,252 --> 00:27:04,346
How can we not serve it
for you, Narayanettan?

618
00:27:04,656 --> 00:27:06,556
Some more.
- Of course!

619
00:27:11,262 --> 00:27:18,464
'All have gathered together with
beats and festivities all around'

620
00:27:19,204 --> 00:27:26,440
'A gathering with the sweetness of
sarbath, and the purity of mist'

621
00:27:27,212 --> 00:27:34,345
'Shining bright and white, pure as dawn;
forthe kids, this is a festival'

622
00:27:34,586 --> 00:27:41,219
Team DrC

623
00:27:41,693 --> 00:27:42,660
Baijuetta!

624
00:27:43,528 --> 00:27:45,359
Those who haven't
eaten, please sit.

625
00:27:45,597 --> 00:27:46,564
Chechi!

626
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:48,966
Next will be your
wedding, right Unni?

627
00:27:49,067 --> 00:27:50,557
l've been trying for so long!

628
00:27:50,702 --> 00:27:52,260
Nothing is working out.

629
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:54,736
Chechi, how is it?
We make a good pair, right?

630
00:27:55,073 --> 00:27:57,371
Baijuettan, tell me.
- Shut up, you fool!

631
00:27:57,475 --> 00:28:00,103
Don't get people talking.
Eat & clear the place.

632
00:28:01,546 --> 00:28:03,207
l like it when he gets angry!

633
00:28:03,281 --> 00:28:04,680
l know!

634
00:28:11,122 --> 00:28:12,646
That boy is playing well!

635
00:28:12,757 --> 00:28:14,588
Alvin. He is a good
bowler as well.

636
00:28:14,659 --> 00:28:16,490
Narayanettan is out
with his phone.

637
00:28:16,728 --> 00:28:17,729
Hello!

638
00:28:17,729 --> 00:28:19,663
Hey! There he comes again!

639
00:28:19,731 --> 00:28:20,698
Hello!

640
00:28:21,466 --> 00:28:23,201
l have come out.

641
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:24,168
You guys play!

642
00:28:24,235 --> 00:28:26,203
Hit it on his head,
only then he'll learn!

643
00:28:26,271 --> 00:28:27,397
ls he possessed or what?

644
00:28:27,472 --> 00:28:28,606
Let it hit my head!

645
00:28:28,606 --> 00:28:30,208
Then you'll see how
possessed l am!

646
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:31,643
l will break your heads!

647
00:28:31,643 --> 00:28:32,610
Get lost!

648
00:28:32,677 --> 00:28:34,645
l've got a new clip on WhatsApp.
Sunny Leone's.

649
00:28:34,813 --> 00:28:35,780
Let me see.

650
00:28:36,114 --> 00:28:37,604
Move it here.
- lsn't this old?

651
00:28:37,682 --> 00:28:38,649
Let us play!

652
00:28:41,419 --> 00:28:42,386
Manoj,

653
00:28:42,454 --> 00:28:44,456
that village officer's
daughter is looking for you.

654
00:28:44,456 --> 00:28:45,423
Rose?

655
00:28:45,623 --> 00:28:48,421
Might be Rose for you. For me, she's
the village officer's daughter.

656
00:28:49,127 --> 00:28:50,795
Tell me the truth.
Aren't you watching porn?

657
00:28:50,795 --> 00:28:51,762
A small clip.

658
00:28:52,297 --> 00:28:53,787
l like small clips.
Let me see.

659
00:28:54,833 --> 00:28:57,199
Let me see.
- l'll be right back.

660
00:28:58,069 --> 00:28:59,366
-At least tell me whose it is!

661
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:02,640
Why are you standing here?

662
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,375
They're bringing the gas cylinder.

663
00:29:04,375 --> 00:29:06,644
l think it's a new guy. He
called asking forthe way here.

664
00:29:06,644 --> 00:29:07,611
ls it?
- Yes.

665
00:29:08,146 --> 00:29:10,148
What were you all
doing underthe tree?

666
00:29:10,148 --> 00:29:12,275
Well.. They were watching a clip..
l mean, comedy clip.

667
00:29:12,684 --> 00:29:14,686
But l didn't see
anyone laughing.

668
00:29:14,686 --> 00:29:16,321
lt wasn't a very
funny comedy clip.

669
00:29:16,321 --> 00:29:18,414
- The gas cylinder is here.
How was your exam?

670
00:29:18,523 --> 00:29:20,150
For the security test?

671
00:29:20,225 --> 00:29:21,192
lt went well!

672
00:29:21,493 --> 00:29:23,757
Your dad's demand is a
governmentjob, right?

673
00:29:24,162 --> 00:29:29,600
Team DrC

674
00:29:29,834 --> 00:29:31,402
lf l have to keep it inside,

675
00:29:31,402 --> 00:29:32,801
you have to pay me Rs.50 extra!

676
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:34,672
Rs.50 just like that?
No way!

677
00:29:34,672 --> 00:29:36,333
You'll leave it on
the road or what?

678
00:29:36,407 --> 00:29:37,374
Okay then!

679
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:40,311
Give me the money for the gas.
l don't need that extra money!

680
00:29:40,311 --> 00:29:41,642
What about this cylinder?.

681
00:29:42,147 --> 00:29:43,671
l will keep it inside.

682
00:29:43,882 --> 00:29:44,849
With pleasure!

683
00:29:48,653 --> 00:29:50,155
Your beard looks nice.

684
00:29:50,155 --> 00:29:51,523
ls it? Everyone tells me that!

685
00:29:51,523 --> 00:29:52,490
Over there.

686
00:29:52,857 --> 00:29:54,654
lt's a little heavier
than l expected!

687
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:03,097
Are you alone here?
- That cylinder is empty!

688
00:30:03,268 --> 00:30:04,758
Go after connecting this one.

689
00:30:05,703 --> 00:30:07,261
Should l move this stool?

690
00:30:09,107 --> 00:30:10,870
Rose!
- What is it, grandma?

691
00:30:11,376 --> 00:30:13,640
- Where is Sara?
- She is playing outside.

692
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:15,874
Just sweep the place too.

693
00:30:23,888 --> 00:30:25,822
The November rains have
never cheated us.

694
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:28,222
lt didn't rain properly
during August too!

695
00:30:28,393 --> 00:30:30,562
lf we don't get the
November rains,

696
00:30:30,562 --> 00:30:33,398
there will be a warfor
water during this summer.

697
00:30:33,398 --> 00:30:34,695
There's no doubt about that!

698
00:30:35,633 --> 00:30:37,294
- l've won.
Give me the money.

699
00:30:37,569 --> 00:30:39,093
- What is this, Manoj?

700
00:30:39,304 --> 00:30:41,135
Hey! Throw the ball here.

701
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:43,838
Stop it!
Enough!

702
00:30:44,809 --> 00:30:46,744
All of you come here!
Don't stand under the tree!

703
00:30:46,744 --> 00:30:48,473
The branches are falling!
Sara!

704
00:30:48,746 --> 00:30:49,747
Come!

705
00:30:49,747 --> 00:30:50,873
Come, Chechi.
Let's go fast.

706
00:30:51,716 --> 00:30:53,115
Such a strong wind!

707
00:30:53,284 --> 00:30:54,251
Crap!

708
00:30:54,619 --> 00:30:56,246
Dude, the Puma car!

709
00:30:56,654 --> 00:30:58,289
ls this the Katrina storm?

710
00:30:58,289 --> 00:30:59,688
Kids, hold on to Arun!

711
00:31:02,227 --> 00:31:03,285
Who is this?

712
00:31:04,229 --> 00:31:07,255
ls it someone who saw our match &
came to invite us forthe lPL?

713
00:31:07,398 --> 00:31:09,500
Rajasthan Royals have
selected people like that.

714
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:13,304
lf they're here to select the team
for 11 Heroes, l might get a chance.

715
00:31:13,304 --> 00:31:15,465
You need a certain
standard to dream so big!

716
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:16,507
Get lost!

717
00:31:16,608 --> 00:31:18,269
The car has left!

718
00:31:18,776 --> 00:31:20,266
There goes your Rajasthan Royals!

719
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:24,706
Good stuff, right?

720
00:31:26,251 --> 00:31:27,878
Hey!
Did you get anything?

721
00:31:28,253 --> 00:31:30,288
The kids are fishing there.

722
00:31:30,288 --> 00:31:33,223
- They might give us some if we pay them.
- There's a chick among them!

723
00:31:37,295 --> 00:31:38,262
Lift it!

724
00:31:41,299 --> 00:31:42,789
My God, is that a snake?

725
00:31:44,469 --> 00:31:45,436
Put it here.

726
00:31:48,306 --> 00:31:51,742
What's left in our life if we
leave our town and ourfriends?

727
00:31:51,809 --> 00:31:54,243
Why are you being so dramatic,
early in the morning?

728
00:31:54,979 --> 00:31:56,640
Nothing!
- Tell us the matter!

729
00:31:56,714 --> 00:32:00,318
When he saw us fishing, he felt
like reciting a poem! That's all!

730
00:32:00,318 --> 00:32:02,343
No! Jose is upset since morning!
What's the matter?.

731
00:32:02,487 --> 00:32:04,284
My family doesn't
want me to stay here.

732
00:32:04,689 --> 00:32:07,180
They've paid the money
to send me to the Gulf.

733
00:32:07,659 --> 00:32:09,286
Won't l be able to
make a living here?

734
00:32:09,727 --> 00:32:11,329
Go make some money, man!

735
00:32:11,329 --> 00:32:12,421
l have to make a living.

736
00:32:12,497 --> 00:32:14,265
That's all, right?

737
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:15,698
Got it!

738
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:17,894
lt's still alive!
- Don't be scared. Give it here!

739
00:32:19,003 --> 00:32:20,470
Will she give it if we ask her?

740
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:22,736
That's quite a catch!

741
00:32:22,974 --> 00:32:24,407
Give us this fish.

742
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:27,468
You have people to
catch for you, right?

743
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:29,781
Give him the fish &
take what he gives you.

744
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:31,681
Lift it up, dear! Let me see it.
- Shut up!

745
00:32:33,518 --> 00:32:34,644
Oh my God!
Knife!

746
00:32:35,053 --> 00:32:36,020
Escape!

747
00:32:36,321 --> 00:32:37,288
Run!

748
00:32:38,423 --> 00:32:39,549
Don't get stabbed!

749
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:41,622
Run!

750
00:32:44,262 --> 00:32:45,354
Come here!

751
00:32:46,698 --> 00:32:49,534
Tell your Patron that
Chandran says hello!

752
00:32:49,534 --> 00:32:50,501
Ya! We will!

753
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:54,939
lt's not easy to trap Chandran.

754
00:32:54,939 --> 00:32:57,999
lf you attack or raid his building,
that will become a huge problem!

755
00:32:58,076 --> 00:32:59,703
For your stupidity,

756
00:32:59,777 --> 00:33:01,472
l will be answerable
on behalf of the club.

757
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:04,377
Don't complain at the police station.

758
00:33:04,582 --> 00:33:06,049
Just inform them.

759
00:33:06,351 --> 00:33:07,648
Don't give a written complaint.

760
00:33:08,086 --> 00:33:09,678
Without a written complaint?

761
00:33:10,088 --> 00:33:12,488
We gave it.
Me & Manoj signed on it as well.

762
00:33:13,291 --> 00:33:14,849
You're discussing it
after signing it?

763
00:33:15,593 --> 00:33:18,426
For collecting donations, we have to
send the junior batch separately.

764
00:33:18,529 --> 00:33:20,622
Don't expect too much donations.

765
00:33:20,732 --> 00:33:22,333
There're no programmes, right?

766
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:23,823
Who said so?
There's a drama, right?

767
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:25,495
Our drama, right?

768
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:27,834
Don't you remember how much
we got booed last time, Jose?

769
00:33:27,972 --> 00:33:29,530
That wasn't the drama's fault!

770
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:31,609
This Manoj messed it up
with his over-acting!

771
00:33:31,609 --> 00:33:32,837
This time it's a different hero!

772
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:34,002
Go to hell!

773
00:33:34,112 --> 00:33:36,273
Even if the director changes,
l'll be the hero!

774
00:33:36,447 --> 00:33:39,848
Among us, l'm the only one with glamour,
acting skills & a hero look!

775
00:33:39,917 --> 00:33:41,352
Let Baijuettan say otherwise.

776
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:43,684
Yes. You should act.
You are a future 'Jayaram'.

777
00:33:46,924 --> 00:33:48,551
Oh my God!
Baijuetta, Police!

778
00:33:50,728 --> 00:33:52,286
Dude, l fell into the well!

779
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:53,624
- Get me out!
- Baijuetta!

780
00:33:53,731 --> 00:33:54,698
Baijuetta!

781
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:56,527
Baijuetta, the Police left.
Climb back up!

782
00:33:56,667 --> 00:33:58,603
Has your dad kept a ladder here?
Rope!

783
00:33:58,603 --> 00:33:59,570
Climb up!

784
00:33:59,771 --> 00:34:00,738
Abhi, go get a rope!

785
00:34:00,838 --> 00:34:03,007
Stop staring and go
get something useful!

786
00:34:03,007 --> 00:34:04,338
- Make it fast!

787
00:34:08,346 --> 00:34:09,643
Are you bored?

788
00:34:09,747 --> 00:34:11,874
- l just fell into it.
How will l be bored?

789
00:34:12,483 --> 00:34:15,941
Forthe club's anniversary, l am
also acting in the drama this time!

790
00:34:16,087 --> 00:34:17,688
Last year, you
didn't let mejoin.

791
00:34:17,688 --> 00:34:20,418
- We'll decide that once l come up!
- Got the rope!

792
00:34:20,792 --> 00:34:21,918
Hold it!
Come on!

793
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:24,060
Ya. Hold it!

794
00:34:25,029 --> 00:34:25,996
Just a minute!

795
00:34:27,098 --> 00:34:29,089
You want to take a selfie
in between all this?

796
00:34:29,767 --> 00:34:31,667
Come up!
Keep pulling!

797
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:37,073
Pull him up!

798
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:42,971
Move. Let me see.

799
00:34:44,115 --> 00:34:45,810
l tripped and
fell into the well,

800
00:34:46,484 --> 00:34:48,076
because l heard that
the Police was coming!

801
00:34:51,189 --> 00:34:53,384
You are so scared of the Police?

802
00:34:54,792 --> 00:34:55,759
Get lost!

803
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:56,927
Mom!

804
00:34:57,161 --> 00:34:58,128
See this.

805
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:01,065
'Nothing to laugh about.
l just fell into a well'

806
00:35:01,165 --> 00:35:02,496
Oh God! What happened?

807
00:35:03,134 --> 00:35:04,158
Are you laughing at it?

808
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:06,562
lt's okay, mom! Everyone
sent it as a joke.

809
00:35:07,572 --> 00:35:08,800
Akhilettan sent this to me.

810
00:35:08,906 --> 00:35:09,873
Where?

811
00:35:12,176 --> 00:35:13,744
He is laughing in this.

812
00:35:13,744 --> 00:35:15,006
Nothing would've happened.

813
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:17,738
There. A new video has come.

814
00:35:19,884 --> 00:35:21,511
What? What is it?

815
00:35:28,092 --> 00:35:30,083
She's worried thinking
something happened to him.

816
00:35:30,161 --> 00:35:31,719
You don't have to worry!

817
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:32,990
When he comes home,

818
00:35:33,431 --> 00:35:35,661
don't let him know that
we know about this.

819
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:38,159
He'll try a new trick
after coming here.

820
00:35:39,203 --> 00:35:40,170
Oh God!

821
00:35:41,038 --> 00:35:42,733
l hope they don't ask
me about my shirt.

822
00:35:44,876 --> 00:35:45,843
Babitha!

823
00:35:47,578 --> 00:35:48,545
Babitha!

824
00:35:50,515 --> 00:35:51,709
Why are you dressed like this?

825
00:35:51,782 --> 00:35:54,148
This dress, is that of a poet.

826
00:35:54,452 --> 00:35:56,181
lsn't it Surendran
uncle's Kurta?

827
00:35:57,755 --> 00:35:59,814
l'm playing a poet's
role in the drama.

828
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:02,592
They are forcing me
to act in this role.

829
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,450
The club's anniversary is coming up.

830
00:36:05,196 --> 00:36:06,595
- Where is your mom?

831
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:07,965
Get me a towel.

832
00:36:08,032 --> 00:36:09,431
l want to take bath.

833
00:36:14,138 --> 00:36:15,537
Why are you hiding here?

834
00:36:15,806 --> 00:36:17,239
l don't want dinner.

835
00:36:17,475 --> 00:36:19,033
l had two Parottas from outside.

836
00:36:20,211 --> 00:36:23,009
l'm really tired after acting
so well in the drama rehearsal.

837
00:36:23,214 --> 00:36:24,238
Heat some water.

838
00:36:24,715 --> 00:36:26,910
There's lotion in the
cupboard inside.

839
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:30,579
lf you buy a Biriyani for me tomorrow,
l'll apply it & give you a massage!

840
00:36:30,721 --> 00:36:31,847
Has he gone crazy?

841
00:36:36,928 --> 00:36:37,895
This is me!

842
00:36:44,001 --> 00:36:45,730
Don't you want hot water?.
- Get lost!

843
00:36:51,642 --> 00:36:52,904
l understood something.

844
00:36:53,945 --> 00:36:56,573
Even if you fall into a well,
you won't say that to me.

845
00:36:57,782 --> 00:36:58,976
Don't cry.

846
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:02,053
Next time when l fall into a
well, l'll definitely tell you!

847
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:03,020
l swear!

848
00:37:03,788 --> 00:37:04,948
You're mocking me, right?

849
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:08,749
You know how worried l'll be,
if something happens to you?

850
00:37:10,127 --> 00:37:11,253
l swear l'll tell you!

851
00:37:11,596 --> 00:37:12,756
Let me sleep now.

852
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:17,301
One kick l'll give you!

853
00:37:17,301 --> 00:37:18,268
Go to sleep!

854
00:37:21,606 --> 00:37:22,573
Hey!

855
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:24,541
You donkey!

856
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:25,876
What?

857
00:37:26,811 --> 00:37:28,301
My back is paining badly!

858
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:29,603
Just massage it!

859
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:31,738
See!
Didn't l tell you?

860
00:37:31,849 --> 00:37:33,282
Where?
- Over here.

861
00:37:36,621 --> 00:37:37,588
Press harder.

862
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:41,555
Over here.

863
00:37:43,995 --> 00:37:44,962
Come here!

864
00:37:46,330 --> 00:37:47,820
Spread it outside.

865
00:37:48,199 --> 00:37:50,827
Looks like it's about to rain.
Might even be a really short rain.

866
00:37:51,002 --> 00:37:53,527
- lt won't rain. lt will just stay gloomy.

867
00:38:02,313 --> 00:38:03,780
lt's 'lnterest' Bhaskaran!

868
00:38:04,148 --> 00:38:05,945
Hey! Do you owe him any money?

869
00:38:06,017 --> 00:38:07,314
No!
- Hey Baiju!

870
00:38:08,319 --> 00:38:10,685
l'm spending money
to educate my son,

871
00:38:10,755 --> 00:38:12,154
to make him an engineer.

872
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:13,851
Not to play cricket!

873
00:38:14,025 --> 00:38:17,961
Who are you to buy a cricket kit for
him, which l didn't buy for 6 months?

874
00:38:18,229 --> 00:38:20,163
You think you're a
patron to everyone?

875
00:38:20,364 --> 00:38:24,095
Are you his dad, to spend 20,000 and
buy all that cricketing stuff for him?

876
00:38:24,168 --> 00:38:26,693
You can make him a doctor,
engineer or whatever.

877
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:28,332
But let him play the game.

878
00:38:28,873 --> 00:38:30,670
l did it for his future.

879
00:38:30,875 --> 00:38:32,365
He might even play
in the Ranji trophy!

880
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:34,045
l will decide that!
- Softly!

881
00:38:34,045 --> 00:38:37,981
lf you try to tempt my son with
such cricket kits from now on,

882
00:38:38,049 --> 00:38:39,277
you'll see my true colours!

883
00:38:39,717 --> 00:38:46,816
Team DrC

884
00:38:47,358 --> 00:38:48,723
Brother!
One minute!

885
00:38:50,761 --> 00:38:51,728
Anyway,

886
00:38:51,796 --> 00:38:53,195
you told me whatever
you had to say!

887
00:38:53,297 --> 00:38:54,958
l understand that your pride was hurt!

888
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:57,291
So, if you can pay those
17,000 Rupees back;

889
00:38:57,735 --> 00:38:58,702
lt's not 20..

890
00:38:58,769 --> 00:39:01,033
A controversial problem in
my house would be solved.

891
00:39:01,238 --> 00:39:03,365
And l shall tell everyone
that you are a man of pride!

892
00:39:03,674 --> 00:39:05,403
Apart from spoiling my boy,

893
00:39:05,643 --> 00:39:07,270
are you asking money to me?
- Softly!

894
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:08,979
Start the car!

895
00:39:10,381 --> 00:39:12,110
lt's been a long time!

896
00:39:13,117 --> 00:39:14,084
Oops! The key!

897
00:39:15,286 --> 00:39:17,777
lt's been a long time
since l took a bus!

898
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:20,757
Shall l leave?

899
00:39:21,926 --> 00:39:22,893
Oh God!

900
00:39:23,227 --> 00:39:24,626
Bhasakaretta, l'm also coming!

901
00:39:24,729 --> 00:39:26,060
No rains in November too.

902
00:39:26,263 --> 00:39:28,754
And it didn't rain properly
during July and August too!

903
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:32,226
The climate has gone for a toss!

904
00:39:32,303 --> 00:39:33,270
Baiju!

905
00:39:33,804 --> 00:39:35,772
Did something happen when
you fell into the well?

906
00:39:37,775 --> 00:39:39,037
l think the well was hurt.

907
00:39:40,945 --> 00:39:42,879
Are you laughing when
someone had an accident?

908
00:39:43,147 --> 00:39:45,249
But this wasn't an accident,
it was a blunder!

909
00:39:45,249 --> 00:39:46,876
Oh! Was there such
a word for this?

910
00:39:50,287 --> 00:39:51,254
Son,

911
00:39:51,455 --> 00:39:52,922
your name is Prince, right?

912
00:39:54,191 --> 00:39:57,991
Once in a while, take your eyes off
from the book and look around! Okay?

913
00:39:58,195 --> 00:39:59,753
Or else, you might fall into a well!

914
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:05,797
Sebastian Sir, good morning!
- Good morning!

915
00:40:07,805 --> 00:40:10,296
The kids these days are bothered
only about the entrance exams!

916
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:12,432
What else should they
be bothered about?

917
00:40:13,377 --> 00:40:14,979
Oh! You are that kind, huh?

918
00:40:14,979 --> 00:40:15,946
Sorry!

919
00:40:17,848 --> 00:40:18,906
Hey! Baijuettan!

920
00:40:20,317 --> 00:40:22,046
Everyone is so studious here.

921
00:40:22,787 --> 00:40:24,118
Are you studying well?
- Yes.

922
00:40:24,321 --> 00:40:25,823
lf you don't clear the entrance,

923
00:40:25,823 --> 00:40:27,688
everyone will blame me
for letting you play.

924
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:29,157
Here's the notice for
our anniversary.

925
00:40:30,828 --> 00:40:31,886
Ah! Proof approved!

926
00:40:31,962 --> 00:40:33,896
Print it fast. We should
get it tomorrow morning!

927
00:40:33,998 --> 00:40:35,192
Make it fast!

928
00:40:35,833 --> 00:40:37,835
Akhil, l should get it
tomorrow morning itself!

929
00:40:37,835 --> 00:40:38,893
ln best quality!

930
00:40:41,038 --> 00:40:42,062
Boring game!

931
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:44,206
Shall we play Antakshari
(musical game)?

932
00:40:45,209 --> 00:40:47,769
So you have a slight problem
to go back home today!

933
00:40:48,746 --> 00:40:50,077
Yes, Chetta.
Correct!

934
00:40:50,881 --> 00:40:52,508
l have to find a comedy for 20,000.

935
00:40:52,817 --> 00:40:54,512
l'm thinking about it!

936
00:40:54,752 --> 00:40:56,049
20,000?

937
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:57,187
What for?

938
00:40:57,888 --> 00:41:00,049
A tragedy of 20,000
happened in the morning!

939
00:41:00,324 --> 00:41:01,723
Leave that.

940
00:41:02,493 --> 00:41:04,484
Anyway, l'm leaving now.

941
00:41:05,062 --> 00:41:06,029
Hey!

942
00:41:06,096 --> 00:41:07,222
ls Baiju here?

943
00:41:07,364 --> 00:41:09,161
lt's Chandran!
- Oh my God!

944
00:41:11,068 --> 00:41:12,535
Baijuettan isn't here.
He just left!

945
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:15,473
lsn't this his bike?
- l brought that bike.

946
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:16,440
Right?

947
00:41:18,042 --> 00:41:20,478
Manoj, is the door locked downstairs?
He might come in!

948
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:23,470
The police station is
like my in-law's place.

949
00:41:23,848 --> 00:41:25,338
Ask him to keep hiding inside!

950
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:26,942
lf l get him,

951
00:41:27,251 --> 00:41:28,548
l'll knock his teeth out!

952
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:29,786
Tell him!

953
00:41:31,055 --> 00:41:32,022
- Come!

954
00:41:32,223 --> 00:41:33,349
- Has he left?
- Ya.

955
00:41:33,424 --> 00:41:36,018
l didn't think you would
be scared of him!

956
00:41:37,194 --> 00:41:39,185
He doesn't do just weed!

957
00:41:39,597 --> 00:41:41,565
He does drugs, man!

958
00:41:41,565 --> 00:41:43,192
And he has a knife
on his belt as well!

959
00:41:43,267 --> 00:41:45,929
lf he stabs me, who will be
there for Kumbalam brothers?

960
00:41:46,971 --> 00:41:48,233
Don't step outside now.

961
00:41:48,372 --> 00:41:49,771
You're not drunk, right?

962
00:41:49,874 --> 00:41:50,841
l'm not drunk!

963
00:41:51,041 --> 00:41:52,906
l'll be sober by the
time l reach home.

964
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:56,173
Goal!

965
00:41:56,614 --> 00:41:57,615
Hey!

966
00:41:57,615 --> 00:41:59,480
Why are we talking like this?
He left!

967
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:01,913
Why did you talk like that then?

968
00:42:05,222 --> 00:42:06,883
What's the problem
with Chandran?

969
00:42:07,024 --> 00:42:08,184
Nothing, Chetta.

970
00:42:08,392 --> 00:42:10,360
He has a building near
Vellaykkal, right?

971
00:42:10,594 --> 00:42:12,926
College kids go there on bikes.

972
00:42:13,163 --> 00:42:14,391
Both boys and girls.

973
00:42:14,598 --> 00:42:16,498
We just asked the
police to be cautious.

974
00:42:17,067 --> 00:42:18,034
He left.

975
00:42:18,235 --> 00:42:20,465
l saw him properly
from the back door.

976
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:22,472
Someone is leaning
on the gate behind.

977
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:24,371
His eyes look scary!

978
00:42:24,441 --> 00:42:26,068
Get lost!
Don't scare him!

979
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:28,134
They're drug addicts, Chechi!

980
00:42:29,113 --> 00:42:30,546
He used to study well in school.

981
00:42:30,614 --> 00:42:32,206
He had good marks
for maths and all!

982
00:42:32,416 --> 00:42:33,440
But went wayward.
Poor guy!

983
00:42:35,252 --> 00:42:36,879
Shall l leave then?

984
00:42:38,255 --> 00:42:40,052
Hey! Why are you crawling?

985
00:42:40,257 --> 00:42:41,926
What if he is hiding on the way?

986
00:42:41,926 --> 00:42:42,893
That's true!

987
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,053
lf he gets me, l will
have to crawl forever!

988
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:46,829
l'll go after some time.

989
00:42:47,965 --> 00:42:51,196
- When your own daughter asked for a
earring, you had a 100 excuses.

990
00:42:51,368 --> 00:42:53,928
Stuff worth 20,000 Rupees.
That too, to play!

991
00:42:54,038 --> 00:42:55,505
lt was fine if it was
for his studies!

992
00:42:55,639 --> 00:42:59,473
These earrings are of no use to anyone
other than hanging it on your ears, right?

993
00:43:00,110 --> 00:43:02,044
This cricket kit will be
of use to him, right?

994
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:04,477
Your dad won't
understand all that!

995
00:43:05,115 --> 00:43:06,582
He's wasting so much money!

996
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:08,242
People are fooling him!

997
00:43:08,953 --> 00:43:10,477
You don't realize
that, Baijuetta!

998
00:43:11,655 --> 00:43:13,020
They're small kids, right?

999
00:43:13,290 --> 00:43:14,450
This is all part of life!

1000
00:43:15,159 --> 00:43:17,627
Our life should flow
cleanly like this.

1001
00:43:18,462 --> 00:43:22,057
When l say something serious, your dad
says these lame drama dialogues.

1002
00:43:23,067 --> 00:43:25,501
My relationship with this club
started during my childhood.

1003
00:43:26,303 --> 00:43:27,998
Playing at the ground
every evening,

1004
00:43:28,205 --> 00:43:30,105
is my routine for
the past 35 years.

1005
00:43:30,674 --> 00:43:32,198
Whenever l felt sad as a kid,

1006
00:43:32,343 --> 00:43:34,174
this ground used to console me.
You know that?

1007
00:43:36,113 --> 00:43:38,308
Did you have so much sorrow
during your childhood?

1008
00:43:38,682 --> 00:43:40,912
Ya. My dad was Ratan
Tata's in-law, right?

1009
00:43:41,185 --> 00:43:43,210
So we didn't have any
scarcity for money, right mom?

1010
00:43:43,354 --> 00:43:44,480
- Get lost!
- Dear,

1011
00:43:45,089 --> 00:43:46,886
l will give you earrings.
Come!

1012
00:43:47,224 --> 00:43:48,418
Grandma's old earrings.

1013
00:43:48,492 --> 00:43:49,584
l don't want that!

1014
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:50,961
l want one that's in fashion!

1015
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:52,588
lt will be in fashion soon.
Wait & watch!

1016
00:43:52,663 --> 00:43:53,697
Ya right!

1017
00:43:53,697 --> 00:43:56,359
For everything that l wear to turn
fashionable, am l Kavya Madhavan or what?

1018
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:57,434
Babitha Baiju!

1019
00:43:57,601 --> 00:43:59,330
You're one step higher
than Kavya Madhavan!

1020
00:44:00,004 --> 00:44:01,164
Babitha Baiju!

1021
00:44:01,505 --> 00:44:04,338
Such a lousy name & you want
me to beat Kavya Madhavan?

1022
00:44:05,275 --> 00:44:06,333
Then take off that Baiju!

1023
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:08,945
Baiju.

1024
00:44:09,613 --> 00:44:11,137
Look at the name
you've given me!

1025
00:44:23,727 --> 00:44:25,217
Why are you hiding here, kids?

1026
00:44:25,529 --> 00:44:28,191
We have a football match today.
We came to call Alwinettan.

1027
00:44:28,265 --> 00:44:29,596
His dad didn't let him come.

1028
00:44:29,967 --> 00:44:31,730
lf you ask him, his dad might allow.

1029
00:44:32,302 --> 00:44:33,735
Can you please ask him?

1030
00:44:37,307 --> 00:44:38,569
l'll ask him.
Come!

1031
00:44:43,113 --> 00:44:44,637
ls there a dog here, Sir?

1032
00:44:44,715 --> 00:44:45,739
What?
- Dog?

1033
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:48,041
Have you come to buy our dog?
- No.

1034
00:44:48,385 --> 00:44:50,182
Kids, didn't l tell you?

1035
00:44:50,254 --> 00:44:52,586
He has a scholarship
exam next week.

1036
00:44:52,790 --> 00:44:55,384
l've bought a book for 2000
Rupees & he hasn't opened it yet!

1037
00:44:55,492 --> 00:44:56,652
Shall we go?
- Get going!

1038
00:44:57,261 --> 00:44:58,262
Are you coming?

1039
00:44:58,262 --> 00:45:00,059
- Let him go play
with those kids.

1040
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:03,100
Today is a holiday. How long
will he stay idle at home?

1041
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:05,102
He is not sitting idle.

1042
00:45:05,102 --> 00:45:06,160
He is studying, right?

1043
00:45:06,236 --> 00:45:07,601
He is an intelligent child.

1044
00:45:08,105 --> 00:45:10,505
lf he studies well, the
sky is the limit for him!

1045
00:45:11,241 --> 00:45:13,436
Sports is good.
But that alone isn't enough!

1046
00:45:14,244 --> 00:45:15,973
Didn't you hear him?
Let's go!

1047
00:45:18,482 --> 00:45:20,245
Alwinettan is our Lionel Messi.

1048
00:45:20,350 --> 00:45:22,619
lf he's not there, we'll definitely lose.

1049
00:45:22,619 --> 00:45:24,587
A team should never rely
on a single person.

1050
00:45:25,055 --> 00:45:27,580
The Kumbalam team which used to rely
only on me has so many stars now, right?

1051
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:29,659
Even if l'm not in form,
the team can win, right?

1052
00:45:30,094 --> 00:45:31,322
We should have confidence.

1053
00:45:33,664 --> 00:45:34,631
Move.

1054
00:45:35,299 --> 00:45:36,433
Baijuetta, sit.

1055
00:45:36,433 --> 00:45:37,764
Everyone is at Unni's house.

1056
00:45:37,835 --> 00:45:39,570
Let's read the script for the drama.
Come!

1057
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:41,629
Carry on, kids.
Win the match! All the best!

1058
00:45:41,705 --> 00:45:42,672
Thank you!

1059
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:45,072
Have you finished writing the script?
- Of course!

1060
00:45:45,843 --> 00:45:46,810

'The naughty sun is playing hide &
seek with the lovely flower'

1063
00:46:01,391 --> 00:46:08,263
'There's a rainbow of shyness
in the dewdrop on the flower'

1064
00:46:09,399 --> 00:46:17,101
'Adolescence has hidden
in the golden light'

'There's a rainbow of shyness

1068
00:46:36,727 --> 00:46:38,456
Jibin, l'm falling in love, bro!

1069
00:46:38,529 --> 00:46:40,258
Here is our Malar Miss!

1070
00:46:40,898 --> 00:46:42,695
(Sings a song from 'Premam')

1071
00:46:42,833 --> 00:46:44,198
Hey! Look there!

1072
00:46:47,371 --> 00:46:50,670
'When l reached the other shore,
l found my forgotten childhood'

1073
00:46:50,841 --> 00:46:52,775
These guys are at
it since morning!

1074
00:46:55,245 --> 00:46:56,212
Come.

1075
00:46:56,280 --> 00:47:04,654
'When l rejoiced that forgotten past,
l felt a sweetness l haven't felt earlier'

1076
00:47:07,558 --> 00:47:09,185
Your song was really good.

1077
00:47:09,393 --> 00:47:11,428
Your dress & earrings
are also awesome!

1078
00:47:11,428 --> 00:47:12,895
l liked your earrings, Babitha.

1079
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:15,799
Where did you buy it from?
- l don't know. Grandpa gifted it.

1080
00:47:15,799 --> 00:47:16,788
Robin is coming.

1081
00:47:16,934 --> 00:47:18,629
He passed out last year.

1082
00:47:19,236 --> 00:47:21,261
Don't answer him
whatever he asks.

1083
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:22,699
He is a nuisance!
- Hi.

1084
00:47:23,707 --> 00:47:24,942
When l saw you on stage,

1085
00:47:24,942 --> 00:47:27,376
and heard you sing;
and this dress & ornaments;

1086
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:29,779
What do l say?
l liked everything!

1087
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:31,112
Thanks.

1088
00:47:31,448 --> 00:47:32,415
Hi Reema!

1089
00:47:33,483 --> 00:47:35,713
Sheesh! What do l
tell this girl?

1090
00:47:36,153 --> 00:47:37,518
Shall l say 'l love you'?

1091
00:47:37,621 --> 00:47:38,679
That's easier.

1092
00:47:39,723 --> 00:47:41,520
Sorry. l am a little drunk.

1093
00:47:41,658 --> 00:47:43,216
- What are you doing here, Robin?

1094
00:47:43,827 --> 00:47:45,727
Why have you come here?

1095
00:47:45,829 --> 00:47:47,524
Get out of the school compound!

1096
00:47:47,998 --> 00:47:57,532
Team DrC

1097
00:47:58,308 --> 00:47:59,832
Hey! Why are you so angry?

1098
00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:01,368
Did l come to hurt you?

1099
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:02,906
l came to love you, right?

1100
00:48:05,315 --> 00:48:06,373
Babitha, go home.

1101
00:48:06,483 --> 00:48:07,780
Dude, go with her.

1102
00:48:07,885 --> 00:48:10,911
She is my sister.
She has around 12 brothers here.

1103
00:48:11,388 --> 00:48:13,948
Eight of us came hearing about
your performance earlier.

1104
00:48:14,758 --> 00:48:16,623
Looks like you don't believe me!

1105
00:48:17,628 --> 00:48:20,563
You want a letter from a Panchayat
member to believe us? - Enough, dude!

1106
00:48:20,797 --> 00:48:21,764
Enough, dude!

1107
00:48:24,935 --> 00:48:26,562
Enough! Enough!

1108
00:48:27,271 --> 00:48:28,238
Get going!

1109
00:48:28,438 --> 00:48:29,564
Get lost!

1110
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:31,475
Didn't you say that
you had no brothers?

1111
00:48:31,475 --> 00:48:33,204
They are brothers;
Kumbalam Brothers.

1112
00:48:33,310 --> 00:48:35,312
But l didn't know they would
come to my help like this.

1113
00:48:35,312 --> 00:48:36,947
We are her dad's friends!

1114
00:48:36,947 --> 00:48:37,914
Dad's friends?

1115
00:48:37,981 --> 00:48:39,316
l am a friend too!

1116
00:48:39,316 --> 00:48:40,248
Get lost!

1117
00:48:41,518 --> 00:48:44,385
For bringing Vineeth, you'll have
to hear a mouthful from Baijuettan!

1118
00:48:44,721 --> 00:48:45,949
Hey! Vineeth!

1119
00:48:47,457 --> 00:48:48,924
Baijuettan shouldn't know this.

1120
00:48:48,992 --> 00:48:50,789
He will get angry if he knows this.

1121
00:48:51,328 --> 00:48:53,558
Phew! You became
smart so quickly? Come!

1122
00:49:02,706 --> 00:49:07,643
Try to study and become a doctor, engineer,
lawyer or some such high level jobs.

1123
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:10,209
Only then, you'll be respected
in your family & town.

1124
00:49:10,347 --> 00:49:12,713
But if you want to go around with
this receipt book & notices,

1125
00:49:12,816 --> 00:49:14,551
you can do that forthe
rest of your lives!

1126
00:49:14,551 --> 00:49:15,984
Don't you parents say anything?

1127
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:18,015
You continue studying.
Don't bother about this.

1128
00:49:18,255 --> 00:49:19,688
At least take two lucky dips, uncle.

1129
00:49:19,756 --> 00:49:20,814
No, dude.
Leave it!

1130
00:49:21,925 --> 00:49:22,949
The notice is free.

1131
00:49:23,026 --> 00:49:27,292
Even without your money, Kumbalam Brothers'
36th anniversary will be awesome!

1132
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:31,297
Then what!
His bloody advice!

1133
00:49:31,368 --> 00:49:33,233
Moreover, he mocked
our parents too!

1134
00:49:33,837 --> 00:49:34,826
That's why l got angry!

1135
00:49:34,938 --> 00:49:37,498
We got only Rs.1400 by
selling coupons until now.

1136
00:49:37,741 --> 00:49:38,901
That's not enough!

1137
00:49:38,976 --> 00:49:40,307
There's so much left!

1138
00:49:40,544 --> 00:49:43,445
Do one thing. Set cleartargets
for each one to collect.

1139
00:49:43,513 --> 00:49:45,981
None of them are going to collect money.
That's the problem!

1140
00:49:46,083 --> 00:49:48,449
Why aren't they going?
Don't we do this every year?

1141
00:49:48,585 --> 00:49:49,853
We should ask this.

1142
00:49:49,853 --> 00:49:51,411
They are also club members, right?

1143
00:49:53,757 --> 00:49:55,554
- l'm in this team.
l'm the goalie.

1144
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:58,687
Go for collections.
lt's already late. Make it fast!

1145
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:00,564
No one's giving us money.

1146
00:50:00,564 --> 00:50:02,862
Some of them gave us. l
gave that to Sudheeshettan.

1147
00:50:02,933 --> 00:50:04,067
That's not enough.

1148
00:50:04,067 --> 00:50:05,736
There are different
kinds of people.

1149
00:50:05,736 --> 00:50:07,033
Some will give, some won't.

1150
00:50:07,304 --> 00:50:08,931
Those who don't want to
give, don't have to!

1151
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:11,804
All this is an experience. You'll realize
its value only when you grow up!

1152
00:50:11,875 --> 00:50:14,311
Baijuetta, can l join your cricket team?
- Of course!

1153
00:50:14,311 --> 00:50:15,869
lf you play well, you can
play in the tournament too!

1154
00:50:15,946 --> 00:50:18,482
Altafettan told me l can't
join until l grow a moustache.

1155
00:50:18,482 --> 00:50:20,473
There's no such rule anywhere.

1156
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:24,819
Who asked you to kick it there?

1157
00:50:26,957 --> 00:50:28,686
Baijuetta, go get it.
Please.

1158
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:30,652
Okay. l'll get it.

1159
00:50:30,761 --> 00:50:32,661
Will you go for collections properly?
- Yes.

1160
00:50:33,096 --> 00:50:34,825
Okay.
- Hurry up, Chetta.

1161
00:50:35,032 --> 00:50:35,999
Or else, he'll burn it!

1162
00:50:36,133 --> 00:50:37,100
Will he?

1163
00:50:37,334 --> 00:50:38,301
Yes.
- Kamala.

1164
00:50:38,435 --> 00:50:41,063
He called 'Kamala' for the broom. To
sweep up the waste & burn it all!

1165
00:50:41,772 --> 00:50:42,830
Will he set it on fire?

1166
00:50:43,974 --> 00:50:44,941
Kamala!

1167
00:50:49,913 --> 00:50:50,937
One minute.
Leave it.

1168
00:50:54,484 --> 00:50:56,453
Aren't you ashamed to
play with these kids?

1169
00:50:56,453 --> 00:50:57,818
That's what l'm also asking.
Aren't you ashamed?

1170
00:50:57,921 --> 00:50:59,889
Got it!
-Awesome!

1171
00:51:02,359 --> 00:51:03,485
Baijuetta,
- What is it?

1172
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:05,824
Hari got selected for Ranji trophy.
- That's great!

1173
00:51:06,029 --> 00:51:08,088
l'm in the 14 member team.
l'm not sure if l can play.

1174
00:51:08,165 --> 00:51:09,496
You'll be awesome!

1175
00:51:09,866 --> 00:51:11,561
We need a treat!
-As you say!

1176
00:51:11,668 --> 00:51:12,930
Beef fry!
-And Parotta.

1177
00:51:13,603 --> 00:51:16,766
On the sports page, will it be
Hari Bhaskar or Hari Kumbalam?

1178
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:17,807
As you say!

1179
00:51:18,175 --> 00:51:19,176
What's the next plan?

1180
00:51:19,176 --> 00:51:21,474
You plan it. l'll go
home and be right back.

1181
00:51:22,479 --> 00:51:24,071
One beef fry is 30 Rupees.

1182
00:51:25,582 --> 00:51:26,810
Dude, l didn't sweat.

1183
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:28,740
l'll be goalie again!

1184
00:51:29,619 --> 00:51:30,847
On what basis,

1185
00:51:31,154 --> 00:51:34,555
did you complain at the station that
Chandran deals in weed & drugs?

1186
00:51:34,691 --> 00:51:36,124
What's your problem, Chetta?

1187
00:51:36,626 --> 00:51:37,786
We weren't lying, right?

1188
00:51:37,961 --> 00:51:39,588
lt's just an allegation!

1189
00:51:39,763 --> 00:51:41,198
The police did an investigation.

1190
00:51:41,198 --> 00:51:43,393
And did they find any evidence?
No!

1191
00:51:43,467 --> 00:51:44,434
- Hello Chechi!

1192
00:51:48,705 --> 00:51:49,672
No credit here.

1193
00:51:49,873 --> 00:51:50,840
Then where do we go?

1194
00:51:51,808 --> 00:51:53,605
There's a spelling
mistake in that, Chechi.

1195
00:51:54,478 --> 00:51:57,106
Who is as educated
as you here, Baiju?

1196
00:51:57,681 --> 00:51:58,943
l like to hear that.

1197
00:51:59,182 --> 00:52:00,717
Even though you were mocking me!

1198
00:52:00,717 --> 00:52:03,550
l won't even give water on credit.
Only the ones with cash have to eat!

1199
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:04,587
That's right!

1200
00:52:04,688 --> 00:52:06,087
Can you pay forthis, Baijuetta?

1201
00:52:06,156 --> 00:52:08,454
Move away!
- Pay for yourselves.

1202
00:52:09,759 --> 00:52:10,817
Did you see this?

1203
00:52:12,162 --> 00:52:13,129
See.
Sudheesh.

1204
00:52:13,897 --> 00:52:17,492
- Eat slowly, Kutta. You're always
hungry, because you eat so fast.

1205
00:52:17,567 --> 00:52:18,802
- He forgets that he ate.

1206
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:20,667
You're writing accounts
for 15 Rupees?

1207
00:52:20,737 --> 00:52:22,102
And you're supposed to be a patron?

1208
00:52:22,205 --> 00:52:23,729
Did you see that 15 alone?

1209
00:52:23,907 --> 00:52:25,397
Look on top of that.
80.

1210
00:52:25,709 --> 00:52:27,176
100.
See!

1211
00:52:28,145 --> 00:52:30,636
Leave it, dear.
l have a lot of expenses at home.

1212
00:52:30,914 --> 00:52:32,541
You carry this accounts
book everywhere?

1213
00:52:32,883 --> 00:52:34,851
Notjust this. l have more at home.

1214
00:52:35,018 --> 00:52:36,986
Josemon, how much did
Sebastian Sir give?

1215
00:52:37,187 --> 00:52:38,984
Sebastian Sir?
50 bucks!

1216
00:52:39,623 --> 00:52:41,591
And he blabbered so
much forthat 50 bucks!

1217
00:52:42,259 --> 00:52:43,453
We don't need his money!

1218
00:52:44,127 --> 00:52:45,695
Where are you going
at this hour?

1219
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:47,595
Drama rehearsals are going on.
Let me go watch it.

1220
00:52:47,697 --> 00:52:50,467
Don't go sit there all the
time & get people talking!

1221
00:52:50,467 --> 00:52:51,957
l've been going there
since childhood.

1222
00:52:52,035 --> 00:52:53,470
What's so special now?

1223
00:52:53,470 --> 00:52:55,529
Girls should realize
that they've grown up!

1224
00:53:01,912 --> 00:53:04,676
ls Lalithamma acting in the play?
- As Unni's mom.

1225
00:53:05,615 --> 00:53:07,173
Hey! Didn't you get any role?

1226
00:53:07,517 --> 00:53:08,711
No. l don't want to do it.

1227
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:10,086
Keep that mixture back.

1228
00:53:11,621 --> 00:53:13,555
Will l get some role?

1229
00:53:14,124 --> 00:53:15,716
They said they need a lady constable.

1230
00:53:16,059 --> 00:53:17,048
Lady constable?

1231
00:53:18,061 --> 00:53:20,222
lf they want a lady
constable, then so be it.

1232
00:53:20,497 --> 00:53:21,464
Let me try!

1233
00:53:23,733 --> 00:53:25,132
He will testify without fear!

1234
00:53:25,602 --> 00:53:26,603
Mom!

1235
00:53:26,603 --> 00:53:28,867
You have notjust
one, but two sons!

1236
00:53:28,939 --> 00:53:30,736
l'm notjust the welder
son of this house..

1237
00:53:30,941 --> 00:53:32,738
Unni!
- Elder son!

1238
00:53:32,943 --> 00:53:34,604
l'm notjust the elder son of this house;

1239
00:53:34,711 --> 00:53:35,905
l'm a policeman as well!

1240
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:38,782
Why did you come here?

1241
00:53:38,782 --> 00:53:39,874
To watch the rehearsals.

1242
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:42,518
Rehearsals are not meant to be watched.
You can watch when we perform on stage!

1243
00:53:42,586 --> 00:53:43,787
Hey! Send her away!

1244
00:53:43,787 --> 00:53:46,223
lf people watch during the
rehearsals, l can't act properly!

1245
00:53:46,223 --> 00:53:47,281
Send her away!

1246
00:53:47,557 --> 00:53:48,922
And when you're acting on stage?

1247
00:53:49,192 --> 00:53:51,820
Everyone are watching you, right?
- But l don't look at them!

1248
00:53:53,296 --> 00:53:55,924
Baijuetta, are you acting in the play?
- l don't know. - Yes, he is.

1249
00:53:55,999 --> 00:53:57,334
Am l?
- Hey Jose,

1250
00:53:57,334 --> 00:53:59,803
Aren't you the director?.
Can you give me a role?

1251
00:53:59,803 --> 00:54:02,038
All the roles are over.
Ya, there's one role.

1252
00:54:02,038 --> 00:54:03,528
Unn is a policeman, right?

1253
00:54:03,607 --> 00:54:04,767
His wife is a lady constable.

1254
00:54:05,609 --> 00:54:06,910
Hey. Continue the rehearsals.

1255
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:09,538
Moreover, that role is not that important.
You can avoid that.

1256
00:54:09,613 --> 00:54:11,945
Hey! l wrote the script.
That character is a must!

1257
00:54:12,015 --> 00:54:13,783
Sreekala will do well
as a lady constable.

1258
00:54:13,783 --> 00:54:15,307
Baijuetta!
- Let her act, man!

1259
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:17,286
Get lost!

1260
00:54:17,887 --> 00:54:19,286
Jose, l lost my mood.

1261
00:54:19,656 --> 00:54:21,123
Continue with Manoj.

1262
00:54:21,224 --> 00:54:22,191
You mean, the hero!

1263
00:54:22,292 --> 00:54:23,259
Ya. Hero!

1264
00:54:23,860 --> 00:54:24,986
What's your role, Baiju?

1265
00:54:25,228 --> 00:54:27,128
l'm not doing it, Chetta.
l can't act and all!

1266
00:54:27,931 --> 00:54:29,728
Your role is a suspense
in this script.

1267
00:54:29,799 --> 00:54:31,668
The role which brings a
twist in the climax!

1268
00:54:31,668 --> 00:54:33,158
lf all of you are
forcing me, l'll do it!

1269
00:54:33,637 --> 00:54:34,626
What's the character?

1270
00:54:34,704 --> 00:54:37,798
The man who presents all the important
evidences against the hero to the court.

1271
00:54:38,575 --> 00:54:39,576
Good character.

1272
00:54:39,576 --> 00:54:40,338
l will rock!

1273
00:54:40,810 --> 00:54:42,971
Are there English dialogues?
- Of course! Only English!

1274
00:54:43,046 --> 00:54:46,675
Do you have Ranji Panicker type
dialogues like (speaks gibberish).

1275
00:54:47,050 --> 00:54:48,847
Much more than that!
- Did you learn?

1276
00:54:49,052 --> 00:54:51,543
No one should understand anything.
That's all! - Then say it!

1277
00:54:52,022 --> 00:54:54,013
What is this, Jayetta?
Why are you talking like this?

1278
00:54:55,025 --> 00:54:57,084
Manoj, your expression
is not right!

1279
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:58,991
You just have to prompt
the dialogues to me.

1280
00:54:59,062 --> 00:55:00,230
l know how to act!

1281
00:55:00,230 --> 00:55:01,720
As if you're some
great director!

1282
00:55:02,232 --> 00:55:03,358
Run!

1283
00:55:04,167 --> 00:55:05,134
Hey Arun!

1284
00:55:06,002 --> 00:55:07,333
You're still at it?

1285
00:55:09,806 --> 00:55:12,001
Didn't you say that you'll come
& play even after marriage?

1286
00:55:12,075 --> 00:55:13,872
And you're coming for
the anniversary?

1287
00:55:16,012 --> 00:55:19,004
Very nice. Ghee roast shirt and your
hair looks like a cow licked it!

1288
00:55:20,283 --> 00:55:22,843
lt's been so long since
l sat underthis tree!

1289
00:55:23,753 --> 00:55:25,618
l feel like l've got oxygen now.

1290
00:55:28,291 --> 00:55:29,849
Even before l finished saying that..

1291
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:32,795
Hello!

1292
00:55:32,896 --> 00:55:34,591
l'm here at the ground, dear.

1293
00:55:34,898 --> 00:55:35,990
- l'll come!
- Baijuetta!

1294
00:55:36,066 --> 00:55:37,192
- We got the flex!

1295
00:55:37,367 --> 00:55:38,334
Just a minute.

1296
00:55:38,401 --> 00:55:39,891
The flex is really messed up.

1297
00:55:40,036 --> 00:55:41,128
Do you know what he did?

1298
00:55:41,204 --> 00:55:42,205
What?
- Look.

1299
00:55:42,205 --> 00:55:43,172
Give it.

1300
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:44,807
See this.

1301
00:55:46,910 --> 00:55:48,104
l'm not there in it.

1302
00:55:48,178 --> 00:55:50,874
Manoj is like Mammootty, wearing
sunglasses; in a big size.

1303
00:55:52,048 --> 00:55:53,709
Baijuettan is in a
small passport size.

1304
00:55:53,783 --> 00:55:55,717
Hey! ls this the hero's costume?

1305
00:55:55,785 --> 00:55:56,911
What's wrong with it?

1306
00:55:56,986 --> 00:55:57,953
Jose,

1307
00:55:58,221 --> 00:55:59,723
The character is a convict!

1308
00:55:59,723 --> 00:56:01,748
This is not the costume that
the director has in mind!

1309
00:56:01,825 --> 00:56:03,315
l had this in my mind.
Are you jealous?

1310
00:56:03,426 --> 00:56:05,095
Dude, l can't help it
if l look handsome!

1311
00:56:05,095 --> 00:56:06,756
Why? Convicts can't be handsome?
- No!

1312
00:56:06,830 --> 00:56:08,991
This is really wrong. What
you did to us is fine.

1313
00:56:09,065 --> 00:56:10,396
But what you did to
Baijuettan is really wrong!

1314
00:56:10,467 --> 00:56:12,094
Sheesh! He made
Baijuettan really small!

1315
00:56:13,770 --> 00:56:15,169
lsn't your role a suspense?

1316
00:56:15,238 --> 00:56:17,729
lf l make it bigger, people will expect it.
- True.

1317
00:56:17,807 --> 00:56:18,774
So be it.

1318
00:56:19,442 --> 00:56:21,706
Tie it up! We don't have
any other option now.

1319
00:56:23,313 --> 00:56:24,439
l'm going to play.

1320
00:56:24,914 --> 00:56:26,404
Your idea is good, Manojetta.

1321
00:56:26,916 --> 00:56:30,909
l had a doubt when you said that you
didn't get the flex printed yesterday.

1322
00:56:30,987 --> 00:56:32,422
Get lost! There was no such idea!

1323
00:56:32,422 --> 00:56:33,889
Don't try to get Baijuettan angry!

1324
00:56:34,157 --> 00:56:35,124
Come!

1325
00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:36,715
- Dude, how is married life?

1326
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:38,327
To be frank,

1327
00:56:39,162 --> 00:56:41,790
Marriage is an end to
everything else in life!

1328
00:56:42,332 --> 00:56:43,299
There's just one thing!

1329
00:56:43,466 --> 00:56:44,990
There won't be time
for anything else!

1330
00:56:45,435 --> 00:56:48,893
After spending time with her & her
family, if there's any time left;

1331
00:56:49,305 --> 00:56:50,738
l can go for a movie with her.

1332
00:56:52,108 --> 00:56:53,075
ls it so?

1333
00:56:53,143 --> 00:56:55,478
The guy who invented this
phone should be killed!

1334
00:56:55,478 --> 00:56:56,445
Sabira,

1335
00:56:56,513 --> 00:56:57,480
Nice, right?

1336
00:56:58,314 --> 00:56:59,281
l'll slap you!

1337
00:57:03,787 --> 00:57:05,152
lsn't this 350 CC?
- Move!

1338
00:57:05,221 --> 00:57:06,489
Dude, this is great!

1339
00:57:06,489 --> 00:57:07,979
You just bought it?
- Yes.

1340
00:57:11,161 --> 00:57:12,495
l'm leaving, dude.
- Nice!

1341
00:57:12,495 --> 00:57:14,156
We haven't seen you
after the wedding!

1342
00:57:14,230 --> 00:57:15,993
lf l stay here, she
will come here.

1343
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:18,234
- l'm leaving, Baijuetta.
- Go fast.

1344
00:57:18,468 --> 00:57:20,436
- Reach before her uncle dies!

1345
00:57:20,503 --> 00:57:21,902
l'll go for a round and come.

1346
00:57:23,106 --> 00:57:24,073
Rose!

1347
00:57:26,810 --> 00:57:28,004
Did you buy a new bike?

1348
00:57:28,211 --> 00:57:29,178
How is it?

1349
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:32,143
They're tying the flex
forthe drama there.

1350
00:57:32,215 --> 00:57:34,376
We're tying one at the junction too.
l am the hero!

1351
00:57:34,551 --> 00:57:37,213
ln our group, l am the
most handsome one, right?

1352
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:38,844
What's the name of the drama?

1353
00:57:38,922 --> 00:57:40,890
'Questions without answers'
How is it?

1354
00:57:41,357 --> 00:57:43,757
So, it's the 36th anniversary!

1355
00:57:45,328 --> 00:57:46,989
36 years.

1356
00:57:47,797 --> 00:57:49,765
Don't brag about your
flashback today, Baijuetta.

1357
00:57:49,833 --> 00:57:52,199
There are too many mosquitoes. Now
you don't start drinking our blood!

1358
00:57:52,268 --> 00:57:54,133
Get lost, you idiot!
What do you know?

1359
00:57:54,370 --> 00:57:56,861
All this is part of history!

1360
00:57:57,207 --> 00:57:59,767
Enough of the 'senti' dialogues.
Ride this bike. lt's superb!

1361
00:58:00,210 --> 00:58:01,177
ls it superb?

1362
00:58:02,245 --> 00:58:03,212
lf so, Arun..

1363
00:58:03,379 --> 00:58:04,914

ls that needed?

1368
00:58:13,823 --> 00:58:16,553
My character brings the main
evidence against the hero, right?

1369
00:58:16,793 --> 00:58:18,522
lt will be great!
- Expectations will be high.

1370
00:58:19,062 --> 00:58:20,461
l'll rock on the stage!

1371
00:58:20,597 --> 00:58:23,099

For the final rehearsal.

You are awesome, right?

1374
00:58:28,071 --> 00:58:29,402
How is first gear?
Downwards?

1375
00:58:29,873 --> 00:58:31,238
Baijuetta, look at me.

1376
00:58:32,342 --> 00:58:33,309
Awesome!

1377
00:58:33,576 --> 00:58:43,542

1379

Those who are not part of the committee,
should leave the registration desk!

1380
00:58:50,927 --> 00:58:53,293

1465
01:04:36,405 --> 01:04:38,305
Didn't they force me to do it?
- Yes.

1466
01:04:38,975 --> 01:04:41,443
Dude, there are so many
dialogues in the drama.

1467
01:04:41,744 --> 01:04:43,541
But is there at least
one dialogue for me?

1468
01:04:43,813 --> 01:04:45,248
You should've given him!

1469
01:04:45,248 --> 01:04:47,817
Well, direction & script are by Josemon.
That's why!

You sing a song, man!

1473

Fix a drink for him.
Give him the glass!

1478
01:05:00,796 --> 01:05:01,922
Fix a drink!
- Hey!

Hey! There's only one glass.

1481
01:05:05,301 --> 01:05:06,359
After a round is done,

1483
01:05:10,339 --> 01:05:11,306

Who is it?

1485
01:05:12,441 --> 01:05:13,408
Jose!

1486
01:05:13,976 --> 01:05:15,637
This look does not suit this character.

1487
01:05:15,778 --> 01:05:17,211
Let the character be.

1488
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:18,447
Don't bother about the look!

1489
01:05:18,447 --> 01:05:20,816
Nalinakshan & Surendrettan told
me l look good.That's enough!

1490
01:05:20,816 --> 01:05:22,249
Hey! You look like a blind man!

1491
01:05:23,486 --> 01:05:25,647
lf Mammootty wears sunglasses,
does that mean he's blind?

1492
01:05:25,721 --> 01:05:27,188
Then why is it like that for me?

1493
01:05:27,256 --> 01:05:28,883
For you, there's make up, costumes;

1494
01:05:28,958 --> 01:05:30,949
and for me, that lousy office dress?
This is enough!

To the left!

1496
01:05:33,696 --> 01:05:34,663
Don't drag it.

1497
01:05:35,665 --> 01:05:36,893
Keep those files here!

1498
01:05:38,601 --> 01:05:40,796
Keep it somewhere!

1499
01:05:40,870 --> 01:05:42,804
Everything has gone for a toss.

1501
01:05:44,507 --> 01:05:45,804
Don't take my glasses.

1502

With the next scene, this
drama will come to an end.

01:08:38,747 --> 01:08:39,941
What happened?
What is this?

1558
01:08:40,516 --> 01:08:41,483
What happened?

1559
01:08:41,617 --> 01:08:42,982
A tiff with that Robin.

1560
01:08:43,085 --> 01:08:44,109
What problem?

1561
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:46,818
Well, the tiff that
happened in school.

1562
01:08:47,123 --> 01:08:48,147
What happened in the school?

1563
01:08:48,457 --> 01:08:49,446
Didn't Babitha tell you?

1564
01:08:49,525 --> 01:08:50,685
Tell me what it is!

1565
01:08:50,759 --> 01:08:52,659
We thought Babitha
would've told you.

1566
01:08:52,728 --> 01:08:54,525
These guys disturbed
Babitha on that day.

1567
01:08:55,531 --> 01:08:56,498
Let's go!

1568
01:09:04,874 --> 01:09:06,068
What did you think?

1569
01:09:06,876 --> 01:09:10,141
You thought you can escape smoothly
after hurting one of Kumbalam Brothers?

1570
01:09:11,514 --> 01:09:12,811
l am happy now!

1571
01:09:13,115 --> 01:09:15,174
All of you landed up
just where l wanted.

1572
01:09:17,686 --> 01:09:19,916
-A rod?
- You hit our boy, right?

1573
01:09:20,256 --> 01:09:23,817
He'll flirt with any girl he likes;
and he'll do whatever he likes.

1574
01:09:23,893 --> 01:09:25,417
Who are you to question that?

1575
01:09:40,609 --> 01:09:41,576
Leave me!

1576
01:09:41,777 --> 01:09:43,176
- Stop there, you!

1577
01:09:43,579 --> 01:09:44,568
Hey kiddo,

1578
01:09:44,713 --> 01:09:47,511
since you don't have the maturity
or standard to get beaten by me,

1579
01:09:47,583 --> 01:09:48,717
l'm not doing it.

1580
01:09:48,717 --> 01:09:50,708
But if l ever see you
in this area hereafter,

1581
01:09:50,786 --> 01:09:53,050
l will chop your nose & put it in a pickle!
Got it?

1582
01:09:53,889 --> 01:09:55,049
What does your father do?

1583
01:09:55,124 --> 01:09:56,091
Politics!

1584
01:09:57,026 --> 01:09:58,891
Get lost!

1585
01:10:00,696 --> 01:10:02,163
- Wow, Baijuetta!
l'm also coming!

1586
01:10:03,966 --> 01:10:06,560
Dude, l've got 2 best actor
awards for this dialogue.

1587
01:10:06,735 --> 01:10:08,930
And l was the University
boxing champion twice.

1588
01:10:09,138 --> 01:10:10,571
But you guys don't value me!

1589
01:10:10,940 --> 01:10:12,771
So the fight is over?
-Yea!

1590
01:10:13,576 --> 01:10:14,975
lt's all because of this bike!

1591
01:10:15,744 --> 01:10:17,678
Get on your bikes.
Let's go!

1592
01:10:18,147 --> 01:10:19,910
Monkeys who don't
respect the Captain.

1593
01:10:19,982 --> 01:10:21,116
l'll go with him.

1594
01:10:21,116 --> 01:10:23,550
- They want to mess with us?
- You could've continued a little longer.

1595
01:10:24,286 --> 01:10:25,253
Dude,

1596
01:10:25,721 --> 01:10:27,518
l thought only she will be here.

1597
01:10:27,890 --> 01:10:29,255
But her entire family is here.

1598
01:10:29,625 --> 01:10:32,116
l got up early in the morning & had
to listen to all these gospels!

1599
01:10:32,628 --> 01:10:33,595
Dude,

1600
01:10:33,696 --> 01:10:34,993
Rose didn't even look at me.

1601
01:10:35,764 --> 01:10:37,026
Why are you laughing?

1602
01:10:38,133 --> 01:10:40,101
Tell them that l'll
come some other day.

1603
01:10:40,769 --> 01:10:43,260
You played Ajayan in
yesterday's drama, right?

1604
01:10:43,339 --> 01:10:46,672
Yes. All of them demanded
that l should play the hero.

1605
01:10:46,775 --> 01:10:50,142
Whatever it is, your acting was very bad.
l have to say that!

1606
01:10:51,013 --> 01:10:52,571
Why do you have to
over-act so much?

1607
01:10:53,148 --> 01:10:54,115
Over-acting?

1608
01:10:54,650 --> 01:10:55,947
That's because it was a drama.

1609
01:10:56,185 --> 01:10:58,745
ln short films, l
act differently.

1610
01:11:00,756 --> 01:11:02,849
Are you doing some otherjob?

1611
01:11:03,058 --> 01:11:06,027
Or, is it just cricket
and drama, all the time?

1612
01:11:06,128 --> 01:11:07,186
l am doing PSC.

1613
01:11:07,763 --> 01:11:08,787
PSC?

1614
01:11:09,231 --> 01:11:11,199
l mean l'm writing PSC tests.

1615
01:11:12,067 --> 01:11:13,534
My goal is a governmentjob.

1616
01:11:13,602 --> 01:11:15,866
l'll get it soon. After that,
l don't have to do any work!

1617
01:11:15,938 --> 01:11:17,701
Stop a little away from the road.
- l know.

1618
01:11:30,753 --> 01:11:31,947
Wait here, okay?

1619
01:11:36,725 --> 01:11:37,793
Over-acting, it seems!

1620
01:11:37,793 --> 01:11:40,353
lf he wasn't my future father-in-law,
l would've kicked him!

1621
01:11:41,830 --> 01:11:44,128
She could've asked me to join
them for breakfast, right?

1622
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:46,627
l'm so hungry!

1623
01:11:49,772 --> 01:11:50,739
Chandran?

1624
01:11:51,907 --> 01:12:05,219
Team DrC

1625
01:12:06,755 --> 01:12:09,189
l told them then itself
not to tell you.

1626
01:12:09,725 --> 01:12:11,124
Why should you hide it from me?

1627
01:12:11,193 --> 01:12:13,388
You would've shouted at me
like this if l said it, right?

1628
01:12:17,199 --> 01:12:18,166
Baijuetta!

1629
01:12:20,235 --> 01:12:21,600
Oh! You're leaving today?

1630
01:12:21,670 --> 01:12:22,728
When is your flight?

1631
01:12:23,172 --> 01:12:25,240
He has to reach airport by 7.
Flight is at 9.

1632
01:12:25,240 --> 01:12:26,366
Aren't you coming?

1633
01:12:26,775 --> 01:12:28,003
l can't come dressed like this.

1634
01:12:28,077 --> 01:12:29,339
Then go home, change and come.

1635
01:12:29,645 --> 01:12:31,078
So you're really leaving, Jose?

1636
01:12:33,415 --> 01:12:36,043
l thought it was your emotional
blackmail to direct the drama.

1637
01:12:36,285 --> 01:12:38,719
Manoj wanted to change
the director, right?

1638
01:12:43,325 --> 01:12:44,883
lt's your phone!
- Mine?

1639
01:12:47,229 --> 01:12:48,196
lt's Dad!

1640
01:12:49,832 --> 01:12:50,833
- Dad, it's me.

1641
01:12:50,833 --> 01:12:52,858
- Oh! lt's you?
-Are you going to the airport now?

1642
01:12:52,935 --> 01:12:54,903
No, dear. l'm not going to the airport.

1643
01:12:55,204 --> 01:12:57,104
lt's because of your
parents' pressure, right?

1644
01:12:57,239 --> 01:13:00,174
Just hang out in Dubai for some time to
make them happy & come back afterthat.

1645
01:13:00,242 --> 01:13:01,766
How? He's on contract, right?

1646
01:13:02,044 --> 01:13:04,171
Do something wrong.
They'll send you back.

1647
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:05,947
Don't do anything major.

1648
01:13:06,048 --> 01:13:07,149
They'll put you in jail.

1649
01:13:07,149 --> 01:13:08,116
A small one.

1650
01:13:08,250 --> 01:13:10,047
l don't have to teach
you that, right?

1651
01:13:10,185 --> 01:13:11,379
We don't have time.

1652
01:13:11,453 --> 01:13:13,284
Auto can't be as fast as a car.

1653
01:13:13,355 --> 01:13:15,323
Are you riding it?
Without a license?

1654
01:13:15,758 --> 01:13:17,426
Unni has gone with his
'Little Elephant'.

1655
01:13:17,426 --> 01:13:19,291
l think it must be to
meet another bride.

1656
01:13:19,361 --> 01:13:20,362
Baijuetta,

1657
01:13:20,362 --> 01:13:22,331
tomorrow morning Thala's (Actor
Ajith) film is releasing.

1658
01:13:22,331 --> 01:13:23,798
Shall we go?
l've got 8 tickets!

1659
01:13:23,899 --> 01:13:25,801
l can't come for a movie
early in the morning!

1660
01:13:25,801 --> 01:13:27,735
Anyway, l'll come back
soon, like you said.

1661
01:13:27,803 --> 01:13:28,792
Dubai, it seems!

1662
01:13:29,371 --> 01:13:30,338
What Dubai?

1663
01:13:30,839 --> 01:13:32,329
Safe journey, buddy!
Go happily!

1664
01:13:33,242 --> 01:13:34,971
Have you taken your passport?
- Yes.

1665
01:13:39,815 --> 01:13:40,782
Just one bag?

1666
01:13:40,949 --> 01:13:41,973
No. Two of them.

1667
01:13:58,934 --> 01:14:00,162
Where were you guys?

1668
01:14:00,235 --> 01:14:02,066
l saw the crackers bursting
between your legs!

1669
01:14:02,171 --> 01:14:03,472
Why did you have to go in there?

1670
01:14:03,472 --> 01:14:05,303
Burst your crackers
up your @#!#!

1671
01:14:05,941 --> 01:14:06,908
l lost my mood!

1672
01:14:07,376 --> 01:14:09,810
Hari is in the Ranji team, right?
- Yes.

1673
01:14:10,179 --> 01:14:12,044
ls he playing for Brothers
in the tournament?

1674
01:14:12,414 --> 01:14:14,382
Maybe. Let him come back.

1675
01:14:17,352 --> 01:14:18,319
Move!

1676
01:14:19,321 --> 01:14:22,415
Even if you leave the bed & go
somewhere, you won't let me know.

1677
01:14:22,891 --> 01:14:25,155
Were you a cat in
your last birth?

1678
01:14:25,828 --> 01:14:26,795
Where were you?

1679
01:14:27,095 --> 01:14:28,330
l looked for you everywhere!

1680
01:14:28,330 --> 01:14:29,422
Didn't you get my note?

1681
01:14:29,498 --> 01:14:31,796
l had kept it near the
pillow for you to see.

1682
01:14:32,367 --> 01:14:34,164
'Don't look for me.
l'll come at 9 AM.'

1683
01:14:34,236 --> 01:14:35,294
Right?
- lsn't that enough?

1684
01:14:35,370 --> 01:14:36,538
Why do you have to
look for me then?

1685
01:14:36,538 --> 01:14:38,768
Why can't you tell
me before leaving?

1686
01:14:38,874 --> 01:14:41,035
When l left at 3 AM in the
morning, you were fast asleep.

1687
01:14:41,176 --> 01:14:42,438
l didn't want to disturb you.

1688
01:14:43,178 --> 01:14:44,873
While you were sleeping at 3 AM,

1689
01:14:45,013 --> 01:14:46,947
did you get an inner
calling in your dream?

1690
01:14:47,516 --> 01:14:48,917
l went for a movie.

1691
01:14:48,917 --> 01:14:50,384
What movie plays at that time?

1692
01:14:50,786 --> 01:14:51,753
4 AM show.

1693
01:14:52,154 --> 01:14:53,348
At Parijatham theater.

1694
01:14:54,056 --> 01:14:55,182
Here's the ticket!

1695
01:14:57,259 --> 01:14:58,521
l've proved my innocence, right?

1696
01:14:59,428 --> 01:15:01,157
ls something wrong with
your 'Thala' (head)?

1697
01:15:01,230 --> 01:15:02,498
'Thala' (Ajith) was awesome!

1698
01:15:02,498 --> 01:15:03,760
People were in a frenzy!

1699
01:15:05,033 --> 01:15:07,866
lf l go through the front door, l'll
have to hear dad's advice as well.

1700
01:15:08,237 --> 01:15:10,296
So l'll wash my hands & leave
through the back door.

1701
01:15:10,405 --> 01:15:12,032
Or l'll miss the bus.
Enough!

1702
01:15:13,342 --> 01:15:14,570
- Has he come, dear?.

1703
01:15:14,943 --> 01:15:16,774
Yes. But l saw him only
after he took a bath,

1704
01:15:16,845 --> 01:15:19,248
changed to go to the office,
and ate Dosas for breakfast.

1705
01:15:19,248 --> 01:15:20,545
Where was he?

1706
01:15:23,018 --> 01:15:24,212
He went for a movie!

1707
01:15:24,486 --> 01:15:25,453
Movie?

1708
01:15:26,054 --> 01:15:27,817
At dawn?

1709
01:15:27,923 --> 01:15:30,483
While Manoj was playing defence,
l thought we'll lose the match.

1710
01:15:30,592 --> 01:15:32,427
We were saved because he
didn't take a 2nd run

1711
01:15:32,427 --> 01:15:34,019
in the last ball of
the 2nd last over.

1712
01:15:34,096 --> 01:15:35,264
l had called Hari.

1713
01:15:35,264 --> 01:15:36,891
His coaching camp will
get done tomorrow.

1714
01:15:36,965 --> 01:15:38,296
- He will come.
-Awesome.

1715
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:39,835
l'll be there for
the next match.

1716
01:15:39,835 --> 01:15:41,132
l want to play
wearing the jersey.

1717
01:15:41,236 --> 01:15:42,237
That's a high!

1718
01:15:42,237 --> 01:15:43,204
Ya right!

1719
01:15:43,272 --> 01:15:45,570
His wife let him come here since
he promised her a Biriyani.

1720
01:15:45,641 --> 01:15:47,575
Why don't you appoint a
regular Biriyani cook?

1721
01:15:48,343 --> 01:15:49,571
Ask her to get lost!

1722
01:15:52,314 --> 01:15:53,941
We will definitely
win this time.

1723
01:15:54,016 --> 01:15:56,041
Mostly Lanka Sher team will
be playing opposite us.

1724
01:15:56,118 --> 01:15:57,653
They are an awesome team!

1725
01:15:57,653 --> 01:15:59,917
Vipin, isn't this your first
flood-light tournament?

1726
01:15:59,988 --> 01:16:03,082
You're playing a flood-light tournament

the opponent will think that
we are discussing a strategy.

discussing something with bowler Manoj.

01:24:54,556 --> 01:24:56,615
Why should the crow cry
when we are so happy?

1896
01:24:56,858 --> 01:24:57,825
Unni!

1897
01:24:58,159 --> 01:24:59,160
Unni!
- Yes!

1898
01:24:59,160 --> 01:25:00,787
Drop these kids home, okay?
- Okay.

1899
01:25:00,862 --> 01:25:02,597
Baijuetta, l'm taking the trophy.

1900
01:25:02,597 --> 01:25:03,928
Carry on.
l'll come later.

1901
01:25:03,998 --> 01:25:05,124
You old men catch up!

1902
01:25:06,434 --> 01:25:08,493
How was the match?
- Awesome! Superb!

1903
01:25:08,570 --> 01:25:09,798
Georgetta, your coat & shoes!

1904
01:25:11,739 --> 01:25:12,874
Thanks Vipin.

1905
01:25:12,874 --> 01:25:15,138
You learned his name?
- Of course!

1906
01:25:20,548 --> 01:25:22,812
'Kumbalam Brothers'

1907
01:25:23,485 --> 01:25:24,816
You know Harris who
studied with us?

1908
01:25:25,587 --> 01:25:26,986
He is in UK now.
He's a doctor.

1909
01:25:28,022 --> 01:25:30,149
James is also in America.

1910
01:25:30,758 --> 01:25:31,986
He is running a gas
station there!

1911
01:25:32,861 --> 01:25:34,488
He was always a gas station!

1912
01:25:35,029 --> 01:25:35,996
Fart-master!

1913
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:40,462
Did you see Nimmy after that?

1914
01:25:40,869 --> 01:25:41,836
Nirmala John.

1915
01:25:42,470 --> 01:25:43,437
No.

1916
01:25:43,972 --> 01:25:45,667
She shifted to the
city after marriage.

1917
01:25:46,207 --> 01:25:47,606
After that, no news.

1918
01:25:49,043 --> 01:25:50,567
Her husband died recently.

1919
01:25:51,446 --> 01:25:53,710
l heard she's staying in her
old house with her parents.

1920
01:25:55,116 --> 01:25:56,549
l didn't try to meet her.

1921
01:25:57,919 --> 01:25:59,409
l saw her photo on Facebook.

1922
01:26:00,221 --> 01:26:01,848
She is our Mohammed's FB friend.

1923
01:26:03,791 --> 01:26:05,725
Don't you remember Mohammed?
- Of course!

1924
01:26:05,894 --> 01:26:06,861
Azharuddeen!

1925
01:26:11,232 --> 01:26:12,665
Since you've sold the property,

1926
01:26:12,767 --> 01:26:14,132
you won't be coming
back here, right?

1927
01:26:14,903 --> 01:26:17,201
l own three companies in America.

1928
01:26:17,572 --> 01:26:18,834
Around 400 workers;

1929
01:26:19,507 --> 01:26:21,168
l have a Rolls Royce car, man!

1930
01:26:21,609 --> 01:26:22,667
You are awesome, dude!

1931
01:26:26,514 --> 01:26:28,675
To be frank, l always
thought l'm really happy.

1932
01:26:29,918 --> 01:26:31,044
But only when l saw you,

1933
01:26:31,286 --> 01:26:32,253
l realized;

1934
01:26:32,987 --> 01:26:34,545
that my happiness is nothing!

1935
01:26:37,725 --> 01:26:40,091
You must have done some really
good things in your last birth!

1936
01:26:41,196 --> 01:26:43,061
You're the same then,
now and forever!

1937
01:26:43,598 --> 01:26:44,690
Happy man!

1938
01:26:48,269 --> 01:26:49,236
You are lucky!

1939
01:26:54,909 --> 01:26:55,876
Shall l leave?

1940
01:26:56,911 --> 01:26:58,003
My flight is tomorrow night.

1941
01:26:58,580 --> 01:26:59,604
Sorry. Tonight.

1942
01:26:59,881 --> 01:27:00,973
lt's already morning.

1943
01:27:03,618 --> 01:27:04,585
So thanks!

1944
01:27:04,719 --> 01:27:06,914
For gifting me with such
unexpected happiness!

1945
01:27:10,058 --> 01:27:11,548
Nice dialogue!

1946
01:27:13,795 --> 01:27:16,593
These are called the golden
moments of our lives, buddy.

1947
01:27:17,565 --> 01:27:18,532
Enjoy!

1948
01:27:20,168 --> 01:27:21,658
Kumbalam Brothers.

1949
01:27:29,043 --> 01:27:30,010
Keep in touch.

1950
01:27:31,846 --> 01:27:33,507
You're on WhatsApp, right?
- Not now.

1951
01:27:34,048 --> 01:27:35,015
l'll get it.

1952
01:27:39,120 --> 01:28:09,339
Team DrC

1953
01:28:21,729 --> 01:28:22,821
Hey Baiju!

1954
01:28:28,836 --> 01:28:29,803
Sit down.

1955
01:28:30,204 --> 01:28:34,641
l've been wanting to talk
to you for a while now.

1956
01:28:36,177 --> 01:28:37,144
Hear me out.

1957
01:28:37,211 --> 01:28:39,338
Let's talk later.
You are high now.

1958
01:28:40,014 --> 01:28:41,379
Are you the God of Kumbalam?

1959
01:28:41,616 --> 01:28:43,379
Whatever you found out
is true, you dog!

1960
01:28:43,985 --> 01:28:45,976
We are supplying some
stuff to kids, as well.

1961
01:28:46,387 --> 01:28:48,878
You sent the shadow police to
investigate, right? And then?

1962
01:28:49,424 --> 01:28:52,018
Who are you to investigate all this?
l will finish you.

1963
01:28:52,327 --> 01:28:54,090
l'm not involved in that!
l swear!!

1964
01:28:54,228 --> 01:28:55,593
You're mistaken!

1965
01:29:04,906 --> 01:29:05,873
Chandran,

1966
01:29:06,841 --> 01:29:07,808
Dude!

1967
01:29:20,221 --> 01:29:22,018
Hey!
That's Chandran.

1968
01:29:22,090 --> 01:29:25,059
l don't know what happened. l just gave
him one kick & he fell unconscious.

1969
01:29:25,159 --> 01:29:26,626
What else can l do
as self-defence?

1970
01:29:26,761 --> 01:29:27,728
- Rose!

1971
01:29:27,795 --> 01:29:28,955
Yes Dad, l am coming.

1972
01:29:29,030 --> 01:29:30,031
Hey!

1973
01:29:30,031 --> 01:29:32,233
He isn't dead!
He's still breathing.

1974
01:29:32,233 --> 01:29:34,292
So, don't tell this to anyone.
Not even to your dad.

1975
01:29:36,371 --> 01:29:37,804
What will you give me in return?

1976
01:29:38,806 --> 01:29:40,308
What will you give me in return?

1977
01:29:40,308 --> 01:29:42,902
Whatever you want!
When l come to play cricket in the evening.

1978
01:29:43,144 --> 01:29:45,271
Will you be able to come today?
- Why?

1979
01:29:45,813 --> 01:29:47,815
What if he dies?

1980
01:29:47,815 --> 01:29:49,250
Please don't scare me, dear.

1981
01:29:49,250 --> 01:29:51,741
He won't die. l'll give you
whatever you want in the evening.

1982
01:29:53,988 --> 01:29:54,955
Gosh!

1983
01:29:58,726 --> 01:29:59,988
Thank you God!

1984
01:30:00,261 --> 01:30:02,752
Are bargaining instead of
helping when someone is in trouble?

1985
01:30:02,997 --> 01:30:04,396
But don't tell anyone, okay?

1986
01:30:06,434 --> 01:30:07,799
Whom did you arrange today?

1987
01:30:07,969 --> 01:30:09,766
To follow, when we
reach the turning?

1988
01:30:10,772 --> 01:30:13,138
Did you tell everyone
that you're behind me?

1989
01:30:13,508 --> 01:30:15,999
lt's not right to romance
without telling friends;

1990
01:30:16,110 --> 01:30:17,771
lf l don't tell them, they'll
trouble me.

1991
01:30:18,446 --> 01:30:21,108
And, now everyone knows
that you are my girl!

1992
01:30:21,783 --> 01:30:24,047
Oh! How can you decide
that by yourself?.

1993
01:30:24,252 --> 01:30:25,776
You're wrong about it.

1994
01:30:26,154 --> 01:30:28,987
lf you talk to me for some time,
all your doubts would be gone!

1995
01:30:29,257 --> 01:30:31,987
Shall we go for an
outing in the city?

1996
01:30:33,494 --> 01:30:35,894
Why are you staring at me?
l didn't say anything wrong!

1997
01:30:36,798 --> 01:30:38,732
The friend you had
arranged for, has come.

1998
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:39,767
You get going!

1999
01:30:40,468 --> 01:30:42,800
And Manoj, if you are
serious about this..

2000
01:30:42,904 --> 01:30:44,428
you will end up
being disappointed.

2001
01:30:44,505 --> 01:30:45,802
l can say only that much.

2002
01:30:45,907 --> 01:30:47,842
lt's hope that keeps
driving everyone forward.

2003
01:30:47,842 --> 01:30:49,469
So, you also don't lose hope!

2004
01:30:53,381 --> 01:30:54,848
Why are you grinning?

2005
01:30:55,216 --> 01:30:56,478
Why? l can't smile or what?

2006
01:30:57,051 --> 01:30:58,780
Don't try to cross
the yellow line.

2007
01:30:59,053 --> 01:31:01,022
Baijuettan asked us to
go near the temple.

2008
01:31:01,022 --> 01:31:02,148
Let's go then.

2009
01:31:03,791 --> 01:31:05,359
Just get call-waiting on this.

2010
01:31:05,359 --> 01:31:07,327
Oh, you bought a new phone?
- How much?

2011
01:31:07,795 --> 01:31:09,456
5,700.
Made in China.

2012
01:31:11,098 --> 01:31:12,998
l've turned it on.
- Download WhatsApp as well.

2013
01:31:13,801 --> 01:31:15,166
So you've decided
to take the plunge?

2014
01:31:15,236 --> 01:31:17,271
WhatsApp, New phone..
What's the plan?

2015
01:31:17,271 --> 01:31:18,431
Nothing much, man!

2016
01:31:18,906 --> 01:31:21,306
lt's good to be in touch with
George who's in America, right?

2017
01:31:21,375 --> 01:31:23,366
So the inspiration is from America!

2018
01:31:24,178 --> 01:31:25,543
This is necessary these days.

2019
01:31:25,913 --> 01:31:27,141
Let's go inside.

2020
01:31:27,215 --> 01:31:28,341
Everyone has come.

2021
01:31:29,250 --> 01:31:31,912
- Come! Let's go inside.
- l'll be right there.

2022
01:31:32,220 --> 01:31:33,915
These festival committee
guys are trouble!

2023
01:31:34,021 --> 01:31:34,988
l know that.

2024
01:31:35,089 --> 01:31:37,057
l'll just give some opinions
on behalf of the club.

2025
01:31:37,158 --> 01:31:38,557
lt's bad if l don't go
when they call me, right?

2026
01:31:38,793 --> 01:31:40,556
We're going to watch the
fireworks at Karuvachal.

2027
01:31:40,795 --> 01:31:42,597
Me, Abhi & Arun are
coming forthe fireworks.

2028
01:31:42,597 --> 01:31:44,827
lf they say 9, they would
start only by 10 o'clock.

2029
01:31:45,066 --> 01:31:46,829
l'll be there by the time
you finish the game.

2030
01:31:46,968 --> 01:31:48,492
And ya, Hari had called me.

2031
01:31:48,970 --> 01:31:50,335
He might play tomorrow.

2032
01:31:50,438 --> 01:31:51,928
He wants all of us
to pray for him!

2033
01:31:52,240 --> 01:31:54,242
So all of you gather at the
ground & pray for him!

2034
01:31:54,242 --> 01:31:55,869
He shouldn't miss out on that.

2035
01:31:56,377 --> 01:31:58,436
Hey! Go there.

2036
01:31:59,247 --> 01:32:00,475
Stop stop!

2037
01:32:02,350 --> 01:32:04,443
lt's our Hari's first match
in Ranji trophy tomorrow.

2038
01:32:04,519 --> 01:32:05,586
All of you go that side.

2039
01:32:05,586 --> 01:32:07,417
Sarah, Anju!
All of you come here!

2040
01:32:07,488 --> 01:32:09,217
Everyone hold your
hands & form a circle.

2041
01:32:09,323 --> 01:32:10,925
Come closer.

2042
01:32:10,925 --> 01:32:13,120
What about Baijuettan?
- He asked us to do it.

2043
01:32:13,194 --> 01:32:14,422
- You & your doubts!

2044
01:32:18,332 --> 01:32:20,493
Oh my Kumbalam Goddess,
Hari should rock the match!

2045
01:32:20,601 --> 01:32:23,365
What are these guys
planning secretly?

2046
01:32:27,842 --> 01:32:29,410
Okay!
Now you can go play!

2047
01:32:29,410 --> 01:32:34,279
For the attention of the devotees,
be at a safe distance from the fireworks.

2048
01:32:36,517 --> 01:32:38,815
Fireworks are by Machad Venu.
lt will be awesome!

2049
01:33:03,177 --> 01:33:06,447
'Come, my beloved, let us go forth into
the field; let us lodge in the villages.'

2050
01:33:06,447 --> 01:33:10,217
'Let us get up early to the vineyards; let
us see whether the vine hath budded,'

2051
01:33:10,217 --> 01:33:14,278
'whether the vine-blossom be opened,
and the pomegranates be in flower;'

2052
01:33:15,089 --> 01:33:17,491
'And there, l shall give you my love'

2053
01:33:17,491 --> 01:33:19,652
Baiju! Aren't you going
to school today?

2054
01:33:21,262 --> 01:33:24,459
'And there, l shall give you my love'

2055
01:33:30,104 --> 01:33:34,370
'On this lovely swing'

2056
01:33:35,142 --> 01:33:39,670
'l kept swinging'

2057
01:33:40,381 --> 01:33:49,016
'l turned into a little bud on the
branches of a blooming mango tree'

2058
01:33:49,090 --> 01:33:51,125
What are you thinking about,
early in the morning?

2059
01:33:51,125 --> 01:33:52,493
Aren't you going to the office?

2060
01:33:52,493 --> 01:33:56,953
'l searched for you
on the next branch'

2061
01:33:57,098 --> 01:34:01,034
'Why were you late to reach me?'

2062
01:34:01,102 --> 01:34:02,069
Nimmy!

2063
01:34:02,370 --> 01:34:03,337
Nimmy!

2064
01:34:03,838 --> 01:34:14,715
Team DrC

2065
01:34:15,383 --> 01:34:16,350
Hey Hanuman!

2066
01:34:18,552 --> 01:34:19,687
Wait for me, man!

2067
01:34:19,687 --> 01:34:22,053
l've told you many times
not to call me Hanuman.

2068
01:34:23,124 --> 01:34:27,925
'My heart turned into a white
crane on the fields of desire'

2069
01:34:28,062 --> 01:34:32,965
'The morning sunlight and
you would come on my path'

2070
01:34:33,200 --> 01:34:38,069
'Like a black plum
fruit in a vessel'

2071
01:34:38,239 --> 01:34:42,471
'Those hidden smiles
that you give me'

2072
01:34:42,543 --> 01:34:45,171
'Will it be enough?'

2073
01:34:45,246 --> 01:34:47,510
'Will my desires be fulfilled?'

2074
01:34:47,782 --> 01:34:52,481
'As we are drawn closer'

2075
01:34:52,653 --> 01:34:57,681
'A love sewed by silver threads'

2076
01:34:58,359 --> 01:35:01,760
'On this lovely swing'

2077
01:35:03,497 --> 01:35:08,434
'l kept swinging'

2078
01:35:21,282 --> 01:35:22,647
Baiju, are you ready?
- Yes.

2079
01:35:23,050 --> 01:35:24,608
lf you're Hanuman, jump & catch it!

2080
01:35:29,123 --> 01:35:31,250
What's that Nimmy?
- lt's a pocket radio.

2081
01:35:31,358 --> 01:35:36,130
'Those glances at you
without others noticing'

2082
01:35:36,130 --> 01:35:37,791
'Like gems in the
depths of my soul'

2083
01:35:38,065 --> 01:35:41,228
What would we name our club?
- Brothers!

2084
01:35:41,435 --> 01:35:47,141
'The words we speak
in our dreams'

2085
01:35:47,141 --> 01:35:49,075
'Kumbalam Brothers'

2086
01:35:49,143 --> 01:35:50,845
'The words l desire to hear every day'

2087
01:35:50,845 --> 01:35:55,646
'Without speaking them,
we went on different paths'

2088
01:35:55,816 --> 01:36:00,685
'The time we went
our separate ways'

2089
01:36:00,821 --> 01:36:06,760
'The silence rained as dewdrops'

2090
01:36:09,196 --> 01:36:10,595
Why are you staring at me like this?

2091
01:36:11,098 --> 01:36:12,292
Haven't you seen me earlier?

2092
01:36:12,533 --> 01:36:13,500
l don't know.

2093
01:36:13,701 --> 01:36:16,101
But you're looking much
more beautiful now.

2094
01:36:16,337 --> 01:36:17,304
Ya right!

2095
01:36:17,505 --> 01:36:19,268
Flirting early in the morning?

2096
01:36:20,307 --> 01:36:22,104
l was always beautiful!

2097
01:36:22,309 --> 01:36:24,243
All are saying that l lost
some of my beauty now.

2098
01:36:24,311 --> 01:36:25,379
ls it?

2099
01:36:25,379 --> 01:36:27,244
l don't know.
l feel it has increased now.

2100
01:36:28,649 --> 01:36:29,616
Dear,

2101
01:36:29,717 --> 01:36:31,844
how do we send voice
messages on WhatsApp?

2102
01:36:32,119 --> 01:36:33,245
To whom?

2103
01:36:33,320 --> 01:36:34,514
Check for George America.

2104
01:36:43,497 --> 01:36:45,158
Dad, see this.
Our Hari's photo!

2105
01:36:45,399 --> 01:36:47,390
He gave his name as Hari
Kumbalam for Ranji trophy.

2106
01:36:48,536 --> 01:36:51,198
Ranjith trophy.
- Not Ranjith trophy, it's Ranji trophy.

2107
01:36:51,539 --> 01:36:53,140
lt's not the world cup, right?

2108
01:36:53,140 --> 01:36:55,540
Sreekala, did you see Hari's
photo on the sports page?

2109
01:36:55,643 --> 01:36:56,837
Where? Let me see!
- Look!

2110
01:36:58,712 --> 01:37:01,579
Ranji : Hari saved Kerala
in his debut match.

2111
01:37:01,715 --> 01:37:02,716
That's amazing!

2112
01:37:02,716 --> 01:37:04,684
Sreekala, finish yourjob first!

2113
01:37:04,785 --> 01:37:06,343
This will be here.
-Ajitha!

2114
01:37:09,490 --> 01:37:12,653
Why so much love when it's time
for you to go to the office?

2115
01:37:13,227 --> 01:37:14,353
Did you see this?

2116
01:37:14,528 --> 01:37:17,122
A fantastic performance by
Hari Kumbalam in Ranji trophy.

2117
01:37:17,631 --> 01:37:18,598
Who is that?

2118
01:37:18,799 --> 01:37:21,131
Didn't you blame me for
buying a cricket kit earlier?

2119
01:37:21,569 --> 01:37:22,866
Oh! That guy?

2120
01:37:25,306 --> 01:37:27,638
Dad, the PTA meeting in
school is at 4 o'clock today.

2121
01:37:27,875 --> 01:37:30,275
Gopu Sir has specially
requested you to come.

2122
01:37:31,712 --> 01:37:33,509
Don't eat it fully!
Go throw it to some crow!

2123
01:37:34,715 --> 01:37:35,909
Ya. l had called.

2124
01:37:36,450 --> 01:37:37,417
Did you see it?

2125
01:37:39,320 --> 01:37:41,618
Notjust our club, he is
the pride of our village!

2126
01:37:41,822 --> 01:37:42,914
Didn't you see his name?

2127
01:37:43,424 --> 01:37:44,391
Hari Kumbalam!

2128
01:37:46,393 --> 01:37:47,360
Okay.

2129
01:37:52,433 --> 01:37:55,197
'Rose, Rose, Rose flower'

2130
01:37:59,573 --> 01:38:02,940
You're always working! Do
you do all the work here?

2131
01:38:03,577 --> 01:38:04,771
Sarah is playing there!

2132
01:38:05,246 --> 01:38:06,543
Let her play!

2133
01:38:07,248 --> 01:38:08,840
l have a lot of work here.

2134
01:38:11,218 --> 01:38:13,482
Shall we go for an
outing to the city?

2135
01:38:14,321 --> 01:38:16,619
Come, Rose. lf you come, you will like me.
Will you come?

2136
01:38:17,291 --> 01:38:18,258
When?

2137
01:38:18,692 --> 01:38:19,920
What will l tell dad?

2138
01:38:20,628 --> 01:38:22,493
- Dude!
- l am coming!

2139
01:38:24,765 --> 01:38:27,393
lf you're ready,
l'll give you an idea.

2140
01:38:27,668 --> 01:38:28,965
- Rose!
- Oops!

2141
01:38:31,305 --> 01:38:33,205
Haven't you finished
watering the plants?

2142
01:38:35,309 --> 01:38:36,537
Naughty brats!

2143
01:38:38,579 --> 01:38:40,604
Why did you bite
everything here, dear?.

2144
01:38:40,681 --> 01:38:41,648
Kamala!

2145
01:38:43,951 --> 01:38:45,714
Catch it!
Catch it!

2146
01:38:47,254 --> 01:38:48,389
Thanks Baijuetta!

2147
01:38:48,389 --> 01:38:50,658
The direction changed when it
hit the branch. That's why!

2148
01:38:50,658 --> 01:38:51,647
Where's the ball?

2149
01:38:51,759 --> 01:38:54,887
Who let the cow loose
into my field?

2150
01:38:54,995 --> 01:38:58,260
lt has spoiled all my plants!

2151
01:38:58,332 --> 01:39:00,493
The cow & the plants are yours!
What's your problem then?

2152
01:39:00,567 --> 01:39:01,568
Exactly!

2153
01:39:01,568 --> 01:39:04,469
So it was you who
untied my cow, you b@$@#!d!

2154
01:39:04,838 --> 01:39:05,805
l will..

2155
01:39:06,573 --> 01:39:07,574
Hey Unni!

2156
01:39:07,574 --> 01:39:09,343
Oh my God!

2157
01:39:09,343 --> 01:39:11,311
Help!
Help!

2158
01:39:13,380 --> 01:39:14,682
Get up, Narayanetta!

2159
01:39:14,682 --> 01:39:18,379
Everybody, please come.
These guys have broken my back!

2160
01:39:18,519 --> 01:39:19,713
What's wrong with you?
Get up!

2161
01:39:20,454 --> 01:39:22,979
See that!
He's twisting my hand to break it!

2162
01:39:23,857 --> 01:39:24,915
What happened?

2163
01:39:25,326 --> 01:39:27,317
This is usual, Sir. Just
to interrupt our game.

2164
01:39:27,428 --> 01:39:30,295
He deliberately ties his cow
in the middle of the ground.

2165
01:39:30,364 --> 01:39:33,701
lf you had asked me to shift
the cow, l would've done that.

2166
01:39:33,701 --> 01:39:36,537
Let him lie there. lf the bat hits your
head when we play, don't blame us!

2167
01:39:36,537 --> 01:39:37,871
Start bowling!
- Get lost!

2168
01:39:37,871 --> 01:39:39,338
You carry on, Sir.
This is usual.

2169
01:39:39,440 --> 01:39:40,805
Everyone continue playing.

2170
01:39:40,874 --> 01:39:42,576
l'm fed up with this man.
Get up & come!

2171
01:39:42,576 --> 01:39:45,479
Why do you want to fight with the kids?
- Throw it right on to his head!

2172
01:39:45,479 --> 01:39:46,969
Go!
Get lost!

2173
01:39:47,348 --> 01:39:48,975
- Then lie there!
- Someone please help me!

2174
01:39:49,416 --> 01:39:50,610
Aim on his head!

2175
01:39:50,718 --> 01:39:52,379
Come on, bowl!
Let him lie there!

2176
01:39:53,687 --> 01:39:55,052
Out!
- You're bowled!

2177
01:39:55,556 --> 01:39:56,784
lt's because of him!

2178
01:39:56,890 --> 01:39:58,559
That's okay.
Continue bowling.

2179
01:39:58,559 --> 01:40:00,686
lt's a fluke. Don't
take credit for it.

2180
01:40:00,995 --> 01:40:02,792
Dude, knock him out!

2181
01:40:06,400 --> 01:40:08,334
Let me see how you're
going to play now!

2182
01:40:09,970 --> 01:40:12,495
Bowl, man!
- Throw it to his chest!

2183
01:40:12,773 --> 01:40:21,238
Team DrC

2184
01:40:21,815 --> 01:40:24,545
Are you trying to kill
me, you naughty brats?

2185
01:40:24,651 --> 01:40:26,278
Chetta, the bat broke and flew there.

2186
01:40:26,420 --> 01:40:27,887
l will stop all your games here!

2187
01:40:28,088 --> 01:40:31,458
l can use this as
wood to heat water!

2188
01:40:31,458 --> 01:40:32,686
This man...

2189
01:40:34,361 --> 01:40:36,530
That bat was 98
years old anyway!

2190
01:40:36,530 --> 01:40:38,725
We're lucky that it didn't
break during some tournament.

2191
01:40:39,700 --> 01:40:41,065
Shall we collect the money?

2192
01:40:41,435 --> 01:40:43,103
Baijuetta!

2193
01:40:43,103 --> 01:40:44,570
You'll get A+ if you do this.

2194
01:40:44,738 --> 01:40:46,330
l've spent enough!

2195
01:40:46,440 --> 01:40:49,307
l have to get the 5000 l gave forthe
anniversary; apart from what you all owe me.

2196
01:40:49,376 --> 01:40:50,536
l won't give any money!

2197
01:40:50,778 --> 01:40:51,870
Hello!

2198
01:40:51,979 --> 01:40:53,647
Tell me, bro!
- Baijuetta,

2199
01:40:53,647 --> 01:40:56,150
We need an extra bat
forthe tournament.

2200
01:40:56,150 --> 01:40:59,381
We should buy a ball too. Look at this.
lt's the last one. lt's worn out.

2201
01:40:59,453 --> 01:41:02,081
What's the point in asking me?
Unni is the treasurer.

2202
01:41:02,723 --> 01:41:05,487
What's the use of a
treasurer without money?

2203
01:41:05,759 --> 01:41:07,895
You buy it forthe time being.
We'll split it later.

2204
01:41:07,895 --> 01:41:09,522
You don't have to
pay your share.

2205
01:41:09,596 --> 01:41:11,826
Dude, l have seen this a lot.

2206
01:41:11,899 --> 01:41:13,093
Leave me alone.

2207
01:41:13,801 --> 01:41:16,429
There's a best way to make
money without donations!

2208
01:41:16,537 --> 01:41:17,504
A catering contract.

2209
01:41:17,604 --> 01:41:19,435
lt's chicken biriyani!
- Chicken biriyani?

2210
01:41:19,973 --> 01:41:22,443
Each person will get
300 Rupees plus food.

2211
01:41:22,443 --> 01:41:24,809
When is it?
- Day after. lt's a holiday.

2212
01:41:24,912 --> 01:41:27,073
l have to go for the festival
at Chembakam Church.

2213
01:41:27,147 --> 01:41:28,978
l'll get a lot of trips then.
l'm not coming.

2214
01:41:29,116 --> 01:41:30,981
You don't have to come.
Baijuetta, let's go.

2215
01:41:31,552 --> 01:41:32,951
l am a Government officer.

2216
01:41:33,020 --> 01:41:34,954
lf l serve food,
it will affect my status.

2217
01:41:35,155 --> 01:41:37,783
No one's going to recognize you there.
lt's quite far.

2218
01:41:38,425 --> 01:41:39,426
Come, Chetta!

2219
01:41:39,426 --> 01:41:40,994
Only then we will have a team spirit.

2220
01:41:40,994 --> 01:41:42,427
We need our Captain!

2221
01:41:44,798 --> 01:41:47,130
My parents will send me
only if Baijuettan comes.

2222
01:41:50,771 --> 01:41:53,103
Dude, she has agreed to meet me.
- Who?

2223
01:41:53,440 --> 01:41:54,407
Shiny.

2224
01:41:54,808 --> 01:41:57,211
She said she'll meet me at the bus
stop on her way from Bangalore.

2225
01:41:57,211 --> 01:41:59,145
Great! lt will end as
soon as she sees you!

2226
01:41:59,546 --> 01:42:02,071
That's the antibiotic for yourjealousy!

2227
01:42:02,182 --> 01:42:03,149
What?
- That!

2228
01:42:03,450 --> 01:42:05,077
You guys play here?
- Yes.

2229
01:42:05,586 --> 01:42:07,488
From tomorrow, we'll come
to play Badminton here.

2230
01:42:07,488 --> 01:42:08,853
We're going to make
a court overthere.

2231
01:42:08,956 --> 01:42:10,821
lt's full here.
No place for a court.

2232
01:42:11,492 --> 01:42:12,993
We don't need your permission.

2233
01:42:12,993 --> 01:42:15,553
We werejust informing you.
- Then why did you have to say it?

2234
01:42:16,997 --> 01:42:19,932
Let them play, Chetta.
Let's take it in a good sense.

2235
01:42:20,134 --> 01:42:21,465
Do we have space here?

2236
01:42:22,703 --> 01:42:26,139
Didn't you see her arrogance?
- Where? l didn't see!

2237
01:42:26,440 --> 01:42:28,067
Are you leaving?
- Of course!

2238
01:42:29,176 --> 01:42:31,872
Come, let's play with pebbles.
-All you crazy people can carry on.

2239
01:42:32,012 --> 01:42:33,980
You're the only one who
knows these old stories.

2240
01:42:35,048 --> 01:42:36,709
lf l don't open up
my mind to someone,

2241
01:42:37,117 --> 01:42:39,551
these things are enough
to suffocate and kill me.

2242
01:42:40,087 --> 01:42:42,055
Anyway, it's good that this
WhatsApp was invented.

2243
01:42:42,456 --> 01:42:43,980
Or else, it would've
been a big problem.

2244
01:42:44,558 --> 01:42:46,526
lt's been a while.
Why are you acting like Arun?

2245
01:42:47,728 --> 01:42:48,695
Oops! lt's gone!

2246
01:42:48,762 --> 01:42:50,127
Sad!
Just come, Chetta!

2247
01:42:51,798 --> 01:42:53,766
Dude, give me one more leg piece.

2248
01:42:54,635 --> 01:42:56,069
A chicken has only two legs.

2249
01:42:56,069 --> 01:42:57,661
Was this made with
just one chicken?

2250
01:43:03,710 --> 01:43:04,836
Adjust with this.

2251
01:43:05,045 --> 01:43:08,014
- Don't give me other pieces!
- Go back inside!

2252
01:43:09,049 --> 01:43:10,846
You board the bus from Kumbalam, right?
- No.

2253
01:43:10,918 --> 01:43:12,442
No?
- But l've seen you!

2254
01:43:12,953 --> 01:43:13,920
Salad?

2255
01:43:13,987 --> 01:43:16,012
Let me know if you need anything.
l'll come running.

2256
01:43:16,123 --> 01:43:17,090
Hey!

2257
01:43:17,558 --> 01:43:19,856
l noticed your special
enthusiasm for this table alone.

2258
01:43:19,927 --> 01:43:21,588
Don't over-do it.
Reduce it a bit.

2259
01:43:23,931 --> 01:43:25,193
l have to do everything..
- Manoj,

2260
01:43:25,632 --> 01:43:29,568
Not this table. But on those tables,
you have to serve mutton & sandwiches.

2261
01:43:30,637 --> 01:43:32,867
You're doing the talking
while we're working?

2262
01:43:32,940 --> 01:43:35,033
Do one thing. Serve
at that table.

2263
01:43:35,509 --> 01:43:37,033
They wanted some chicken pieces.

2264
01:43:37,511 --> 01:43:38,478
Pieces?

2265
01:43:39,046 --> 01:43:40,104
Okay.
l will serve.

2266
01:43:41,281 --> 01:43:42,908
Baijuetta!

2267
01:43:43,050 --> 01:43:44,915
Ah! My dear!
You were here?

2268
01:43:45,719 --> 01:43:47,754
Didn't you say that you
were in Government service?

2269
01:43:47,754 --> 01:43:49,688
Yes. This is to collect
money for the club.

2270
01:43:49,890 --> 01:43:51,289
This is also a service, Sir.

2271
01:43:51,758 --> 01:43:54,727
So you have such a side
business with the club members?

2272
01:43:55,729 --> 01:43:57,720
- l had told them
that l'm not coming.

2273
01:43:58,899 --> 01:44:00,968
He keeps talking
about Baijuettan.

2274
01:44:00,968 --> 01:44:02,162
ls it?
What do you say?

2275
01:44:02,302 --> 01:44:04,004
Yes.
He is really famous!

2276
01:44:04,004 --> 01:44:05,639
There was a photo on
WhatsApp and all!

2277
01:44:05,639 --> 01:44:07,573
So you don't read the
sports page alone?

2278
01:44:08,141 --> 01:44:09,199
l am in a hurry, Sir.

2279
01:44:09,943 --> 01:44:11,501
Phew! He must be a Communist!

2280
01:44:11,645 --> 01:44:12,839
ls this a rat-trap?

2281
01:44:13,714 --> 01:44:14,681
Which one should we buy?

2282
01:44:20,654 --> 01:44:21,882
Shall we bill it?
- Okay.

2283
01:44:22,789 --> 01:44:23,756
Come.

2284
01:44:23,991 --> 01:44:25,788
Arunetta, a belt
that would suit you!

2285
01:44:25,892 --> 01:44:26,859
Get lost!

2286
01:44:31,665 --> 01:44:34,133
Sudheesh, can you remove this?

2287
01:44:34,635 --> 01:44:36,102
l can't get my hand off.
- What's that?

2288
01:44:36,169 --> 01:44:37,898
l don't know.
- Hold it!

2289
01:44:38,872 --> 01:44:40,100
Take off your hand!

2290
01:44:41,608 --> 01:44:43,132
- Why did you have to do that?

2291
01:44:50,384 --> 01:44:51,715
Shall we bill this, Baijuetta?

2292
01:44:52,286 --> 01:44:53,548
Bill it separately!

2293
01:44:54,154 --> 01:44:56,679
Your Hari was awesome
in the Ranji trophy!

2294
01:44:56,923 --> 01:44:58,652
Will he be selected in an lPL team?

2295
01:44:58,759 --> 01:45:00,750
He will be.
He is very talented.

2296
01:45:01,361 --> 01:45:02,851
Dude, the Kallada bus is here.

2297
01:45:03,163 --> 01:45:04,130
You stay here.

2298
01:45:09,403 --> 01:45:10,370
Shiny!

2299
01:45:11,038 --> 01:45:12,005
Hi!
- Hi!

2300
01:45:13,040 --> 01:45:14,632
Do you want breakfast?

2301
01:45:14,741 --> 01:45:16,003
No. Let's have a coffee.

2302
01:45:16,843 --> 01:45:18,037
This is my friend, Sudheesh.

2303
01:45:18,412 --> 01:45:19,743
Dude, you wait here;

2304
01:45:19,813 --> 01:45:21,678
and tell us when the
bus is about to leave.

2305
01:45:22,883 --> 01:45:24,350
Come!
- l'll tell you!

2306
01:45:24,618 --> 01:45:25,744
Do you like cutlet?
- Yes.

2307
01:45:25,819 --> 01:45:27,754
There's a shop here.
- lsn't your friend coming?

2308
01:45:27,754 --> 01:45:28,948
He already had food!

2309
01:45:32,626 --> 01:45:33,593
Thanks.

2310
01:45:34,161 --> 01:45:36,857
Dude, the bus is about to leave.
They've started honking.

2311
01:45:38,332 --> 01:45:39,731
lt will go cold.

2312
01:45:41,768 --> 01:45:43,633
Drink it.
- The bus is about to leave.

2313
01:45:43,737 --> 01:45:45,398
They've started honking.
Didn't you hear it?

2314
01:45:45,939 --> 01:45:47,774
l heard it.
- Chetta, one glass of water.

2315
01:45:47,774 --> 01:45:48,809
Shall we go?

2316
01:45:48,809 --> 01:45:50,210
Shall l get a cutlet
packed for you?

2317
01:45:50,210 --> 01:45:51,336
No!
- Okay.

2318
01:45:52,145 --> 01:45:54,705
Dude, you settle this bill.

2319
01:45:55,048 --> 01:45:56,015
Keep the change.

2320
01:45:56,717 --> 01:45:57,741
l'll open the door for you.

2321
01:45:59,319 --> 01:46:01,082
Will you be going this
way anytime soon?

2322
01:46:01,321 --> 01:46:03,380
l will let you know when l call.
- Okay.

2323
01:46:03,824 --> 01:46:04,791
Bye.

2324
01:46:04,891 --> 01:46:06,256
Okay.
Bye.

2325
01:46:15,168 --> 01:46:16,863
What happened?
- Did you like her?

2326
01:46:16,937 --> 01:46:18,336
You realized that only now?

2327
01:46:18,438 --> 01:46:19,632
And did she like you?

2328
01:46:20,006 --> 01:46:22,736
What are you saying?
She has divine love for me, dude!

2329
01:46:24,378 --> 01:46:26,175
l have a burning
sensation on my chest.

2330
01:46:26,246 --> 01:46:27,414
Do you want to see a doctor?

2331
01:46:27,414 --> 01:46:29,382
This is not that.
lt's jealousy.

2332
01:46:29,483 --> 01:46:31,184
What?
- Jealousy.

2333
01:46:31,184 --> 01:46:32,151
Whatjealousy?

2334
01:46:32,352 --> 01:46:34,115
You started this with a
wrong number, right?

2335
01:46:34,755 --> 01:46:36,382
Why am l not getting
anyone like this?

2336
01:46:36,456 --> 01:46:38,321
l have sympathy for you.

2337
01:46:38,825 --> 01:46:41,851
But your face is not
fit for romance.

2338
01:46:42,429 --> 01:46:45,262
What kind of a face is that?
Don't rub it in, dude.

2339
01:46:46,099 --> 01:46:47,334
Start the bike.

2340
01:46:47,334 --> 01:46:49,234
You ride it.

2341
01:46:50,937 --> 01:46:52,239
This is why Baijuettan
says that

2342
01:46:52,239 --> 01:46:54,901
there's no point in sharing sorrows
with people who are happy.

2343
01:46:54,975 --> 01:46:56,109
Even l felt the same!

2344
01:46:56,109 --> 01:46:57,303
Let's go!

2345
01:47:00,247 --> 01:47:02,772
There was one benefit out
of this year's anniversary.

2346
01:47:03,216 --> 01:47:06,117
An estrangement of around
12 years was gone in a day!

2347
01:47:07,354 --> 01:47:09,845
What is happening there today?

2348
01:47:09,956 --> 01:47:12,015
Bijilechi's daughter's
puberty function?

2349
01:47:12,726 --> 01:47:15,126
l am furious now.
Keep quiet for some time.

2350
01:47:15,729 --> 01:47:17,287
Baijuetta, good morning.

2351
01:47:17,964 --> 01:47:20,330
lt's 7 o'clock!
Aren't you leaving?

2352
01:47:23,036 --> 01:47:25,061
Unniyetta, what happened yesterday?

2353
01:47:25,238 --> 01:47:26,865
You didn't like the girl, right?

2354
01:47:27,274 --> 01:47:28,434
Baijuetta..

2355
01:47:28,742 --> 01:47:30,334
- Let me know when your
marriage is fixed!

2356
01:47:30,911 --> 01:47:32,173
What is it?

2357
01:47:32,412 --> 01:47:33,379
How do l look?

2358
01:47:33,880 --> 01:47:35,507
Didn't l tell you to
wear that yellow Saree?

2359
01:47:35,982 --> 01:47:38,007
That doesn't look good.
This is nice.

2360
01:47:39,152 --> 01:47:40,153
lt's fine.

2361
01:47:40,153 --> 01:47:41,313
Put this pin on, please.

2362
01:47:41,521 --> 01:47:42,488
Where?

2363
01:47:47,928 --> 01:47:51,022
Everyone is going, but l'm
going alone without you.

2364
01:47:51,231 --> 01:47:53,995
lsn't it betterto forget
everything and be happy?

2365
01:47:54,201 --> 01:47:55,168
Come.

2366
01:47:59,206 --> 01:48:00,173
Hey,

2367
01:48:00,240 --> 01:48:02,208
There's nothing that can't
be forgiven with time.

2368
01:48:03,577 --> 01:48:04,874
Time will forgive.

2369
01:48:05,979 --> 01:48:07,469
Now dad & daughter
have reunited!

2370
01:48:07,848 --> 01:48:10,043
Remember how you reacted when
you heard she's in love?

2371
01:48:10,484 --> 01:48:12,884
He is a Tamilian. We can't
even talk properly to him.

2372
01:48:13,320 --> 01:48:15,185
He is jobless and dark-skinned;

2373
01:48:15,422 --> 01:48:17,322
lt's all the same now.
Nothing has changed.

2374
01:48:19,059 --> 01:48:21,186
Didn't l tell you that we'll forget
everything and get them married?

2375
01:48:22,095 --> 01:48:23,289
Do you remember all that?

2376
01:48:24,331 --> 01:48:28,028
The grief she gave me cannot go away
if she brings her kids & smiles at me!

2377
01:48:29,202 --> 01:48:30,328
She's my sister, right?

2378
01:48:30,604 --> 01:48:32,504
Didn't l tell her that l'll
get her married to him?

2379
01:48:32,606 --> 01:48:33,903
Let him get a job;

2380
01:48:34,241 --> 01:48:35,833
l will convince our
parents after that;

2381
01:48:36,076 --> 01:48:38,044
Tamil won't be an obstacle.
l told all this to her.

2382
01:48:38,245 --> 01:48:39,405
She didn't listen.

2383
01:48:39,479 --> 01:48:40,468
She eloped instead!

2384
01:48:40,580 --> 01:48:42,013
Disgracing everyone.

2385
01:48:43,083 --> 01:48:45,347
You know how long it took for
me to get over that shame?

2386
01:48:45,919 --> 01:48:47,216
What did she say to our aunt?

2387
01:48:47,420 --> 01:48:50,548
That Baijuettan cannot leave her.
He trusts her so much!

2388
01:48:51,591 --> 01:48:53,058
Trust to elope?

2389
01:48:54,327 --> 01:48:56,124
Tell her that she was
wrong about that trust!

2390
01:48:59,466 --> 01:49:02,060
Those who want to come, can come.
l am going anyway.

2391
01:49:02,435 --> 01:49:07,805

2392

'She has blossomed now'

2398
01:49:30,330 --> 01:49:31,922
Why are you hiding here?

2399
01:49:32,933 --> 01:49:34,628
Aunt should pour
the turmeric water.

2400
01:49:35,135 --> 01:49:36,102
Come!
Mom!

2401
01:49:41,675 --> 01:49:44,473

2405
01:50:06,967 --> 01:50:09,502
'She's blushing
with shyness now'

2406
01:50:09,502 --> 01:50:12,505
'The whole town has fallen
flat seeing her beauty'

2407
01:50:12,505 --> 01:50:16,168
'A hundred chariots in her
prospective groom's heart'

2408
01:50:18,278 --> 01:50:19,939
You should've listened to dad.

2409
01:50:20,046 --> 01:50:21,536
ls this why he asked
me to wear yellow?

2410
01:50:21,615 --> 01:50:22,582
Yes.

2411
01:50:23,383 --> 01:50:24,350
Hey.

2412
01:50:25,919 --> 01:50:28,080
Bijila is 4 months pregnant
with her 3rd child.

2413
01:50:28,188 --> 01:50:29,456
4 months of third?

2414
01:50:29,456 --> 01:50:30,445
Get lost!

2415
01:50:33,259 --> 01:50:37,025
We should be taking care of her delivery.
We haven't done anything till now.

2416
01:50:37,230 --> 01:50:39,562
Let's take a family photo.
All of you, come!

2417
01:50:39,633 --> 01:50:40,600
Come.

2418
01:50:41,601 --> 01:50:42,568
One minute!

2419
01:50:42,702 --> 01:50:44,499
Let's take a selfie on this.

2420
01:50:44,571 --> 01:50:49,372
Team DrC

2421
01:50:49,676 --> 01:50:51,371
l had gone to your
house looking for you.

2422
01:50:52,278 --> 01:50:54,212
Just to talk to you for some time.

2423
01:50:54,581 --> 01:50:55,548
Sit!

2424
01:50:57,217 --> 01:50:59,048
Seems like you make a
good profit out of this!

2425
01:50:59,352 --> 01:51:01,411
These days you've been
concentrating only on fishing?

2426
01:51:01,655 --> 01:51:03,919
There's no investment.
Whatever l get is profit!

2427
01:51:06,726 --> 01:51:08,250
l've started using WhatsApp.

2428
01:51:09,462 --> 01:51:10,429
Look!

2429
01:51:12,599 --> 01:51:14,032
Everything is solved, right?

2430
01:51:15,001 --> 01:51:17,404
Balakrishnettan was happy to
see her during the anniversary.

2431
01:51:17,404 --> 01:51:18,496
l knew it then itself!

2432
01:51:19,406 --> 01:51:20,737
You didn't go?
Still angry?

2433
01:51:21,074 --> 01:51:23,042
Some things can't be
forgotten just like that.

2434
01:51:23,109 --> 01:51:24,508
She hurt me that much!

2435
01:51:24,611 --> 01:51:25,737
Leave all that, man!

2436
01:51:26,379 --> 01:51:27,346
- Surendran!

2437
01:51:27,714 --> 01:51:28,976
Yes!

2438
01:51:29,049 --> 01:51:30,116
Come.

2439
01:51:30,116 --> 01:51:32,084
We give this to the toddy
shop across the river.

2440
01:51:32,185 --> 01:51:33,675
We'll get money & a
bottle of toddy.

2441
01:51:34,087 --> 01:51:36,055
Will the toddy be adulterated?
- No way!

2442
01:51:36,256 --> 01:51:39,191
l heard that they have sanctioned the
construction of the bridge here.

2443
01:51:39,259 --> 01:51:40,726
lt will be built in 5 years.

2444
01:51:41,394 --> 01:51:44,329
After that, it will take only 10 minutes
to reach Alappuzha from Kumbalam.

2445
01:51:45,065 --> 01:51:47,465
lf an approach road comes,
we'll lose the toddy shop.

2446
01:51:48,268 --> 01:51:50,361
Who is worried about
losing a toddy shop here?

2447
01:51:50,570 --> 01:51:59,968
''l will leave just one
flower in my bunch''

2449
01:52:08,488 --> 01:52:16,259

2450
01:52:17,197 --> 01:52:23,261

2451
01:52:25,672 --> 01:52:31,633
''l will save just one
song in my heart''

2452
01:52:31,711 --> 01:52:37,775
''To hum into your ears,
when you finally arrive''

2453
01:52:38,551 --> 01:52:44,456
''l will keep just
one room unopened''

2454
01:52:44,524 --> 01:52:50,622
''Most secretly in my garden''

2455
01:52:50,730 --> 01:52:57,101
''Most secretly in my garden''

2456
01:52:57,170 --> 01:52:59,839
''The fragrance of the
flowers has faded''

2457
01:52:59,839 --> 01:53:03,109
''Everyone else has left''

2458
01:53:03,109 --> 01:53:06,446
''The fragrance of the
flowers has faded''

2459
01:53:06,446 --> 01:53:09,506
''Everyone else has left''

2460
01:53:09,649 --> 01:53:15,485
''Oh my companion, when will you arrive?''

2461
01:53:16,289 --> 01:53:24,663
''For you to sleep,
lost in dreams''

2462
01:53:26,132 --> 01:53:32,272
''l will spread a bed of flowers''

2463
01:53:32,272 --> 01:53:38,177
''l will leave just one
flower in my bunch''

2464
01:53:38,244 --> 01:53:43,876

''To make you wear it,
when you finally arrive''

2467
01:54:09,809 --> 01:54:10,776
You finished this as well?

2468
01:54:11,244 --> 01:54:13,337
This is to make the
face more shiny!

2469
01:54:13,413 --> 01:54:15,506
You are never going to become
fair, if you use this.

2470
01:54:15,715 --> 01:54:18,684
With all your shining, you haven't
found a bride yet, right?

2471
01:54:20,920 --> 01:54:24,185
lnstead of searching for girls
who look like actresses,

2472
01:54:24,324 --> 01:54:25,655
that Sreekalachechi..
- No!

2473
01:54:25,725 --> 01:54:27,454
Don't start!
l know the rest!

2474
01:54:28,528 --> 01:54:30,655
She always says that to me!

2475
01:54:31,264 --> 01:54:33,926
l like her. Even mom likes her.
All of us like her.

2476
01:54:34,167 --> 01:54:35,293
But l don't like her!

2477
01:54:35,535 --> 01:54:37,230
Whatever you say, beauty
is a must for me!

2478
01:54:37,337 --> 01:54:39,305
Buy some 'Fair &
Lovely' for her too!

2479
01:54:39,405 --> 01:54:41,574
You became handsome using that, right?
- Don't mock me!

2480
01:54:41,574 --> 01:54:44,873
We could've hosted 2 weddings with the
money you wasted by searching for girls.

2481
01:54:44,944 --> 01:54:45,945
Dad!

2482
01:54:45,945 --> 01:54:47,879
l have my own precise
concepts about my marriage!

2483
01:54:47,981 --> 01:54:48,948
Mom!

2484
01:54:50,717 --> 01:54:53,686
So you were the one who was prompting
mom standing behind the door?

2485
01:54:53,686 --> 01:54:55,288
Girls should have some shame!

2486
01:54:55,288 --> 01:54:57,188
You are the one still looking
for brides shamelessly!

2487
01:54:57,257 --> 01:54:58,224
Mom!

2488
01:54:58,458 --> 01:55:01,359
Even if l have to stay unmarried
for my whole lifetime,

2489
01:55:01,461 --> 01:55:02,928
there's no way l'm
going to marry you!

2490
01:55:03,396 --> 01:55:05,261
l feel that you will
end up with her!

2491
01:55:05,698 --> 01:55:07,222
Why do you want to waste the diesel?

2492
01:55:07,567 --> 01:55:08,932
Make your friend understand!

2493
01:55:09,535 --> 01:55:11,738
l'm bored of visiting houses
of your potential brides!

2494
01:55:11,738 --> 01:55:14,298
lt's always laddoo, mixture &
tea or banana, mixture & tea.

2495
01:55:14,407 --> 01:55:15,567
Today l want Biriyani.

2496
01:55:15,642 --> 01:55:17,405
Biriyani, right?
Get inside.

2497
01:55:18,978 --> 01:55:21,879
Dude, how much did you
want to take Rose to the city?

2498
01:55:22,248 --> 01:55:23,215
1000.

2499
01:55:23,283 --> 01:55:24,875
1000? When is it?
- Next week.

2500
01:55:26,586 --> 01:55:29,384
Dude, l got this date by
going behind her for months!

2501
01:55:29,455 --> 01:55:30,523
Don't cheat me.

2502
01:55:30,523 --> 01:55:32,184
Won't you give me 1000 Rupees?

2503
01:55:34,227 --> 01:55:36,218
l'll adjust with mixture and tea, man!
- No dude!

2504
01:55:43,002 --> 01:55:46,563
lf we have to impress the girl and
herfamily, we shouldn't talk much.

2505
01:55:46,673 --> 01:55:47,833
l won't even open my mouth.

2506
01:55:47,941 --> 01:55:50,535
l will reply only if they ask me
something; that too in one word.

2507
01:55:50,643 --> 01:55:52,545
That's enough.
l'll take care of the rest.

2508
01:55:52,545 --> 01:55:55,605
lf l am late to answer,
don't talk in between.

2509
01:55:55,715 --> 01:55:57,649
You are the limit man!
Come!

2510
01:55:57,717 --> 01:55:59,651
- Where are you going ?
Stop right there!

2511
01:56:00,420 --> 01:56:02,718
- l have been tolerating
this since morning!

2512
01:56:03,423 --> 01:56:04,890
- What did l do?

2513
01:56:05,358 --> 01:56:06,689
- l'm in the kitchen all the time.

2514
01:56:06,759 --> 01:56:09,922
- How do l know where our children are
going & who all they are talking to?

2515
01:56:10,563 --> 01:56:12,292
- This bloody Facebook..

2516
01:56:12,398 --> 01:56:14,701
We have come to meet the
girl here for a proposal.

2517
01:56:14,701 --> 01:56:15,793
There isn't any girl here!

2518
01:56:15,868 --> 01:56:17,733
Didn't Shashi broker say
that we'll come today?

2519
01:56:17,837 --> 01:56:18,972
Not that.

2520
01:56:18,972 --> 01:56:21,497
Didn't Shashi broker say that
l would be coming here today?

2521
01:56:21,574 --> 01:56:22,575
Well,

2522
01:56:22,575 --> 01:56:25,874
No one has said anything to me, and
l don't know anything as well!

2523
01:56:28,481 --> 01:56:32,247
The girl whom you came to meet,
is missing since today morning.

2524
01:56:32,685 --> 01:56:35,381
l think she eloped with someone.
- That's right!

2525
01:56:35,455 --> 01:56:36,615
You are right!

2526
01:56:36,856 --> 01:56:39,916
And ya, don't tell
this to anyone.

2527
01:56:39,993 --> 01:56:41,790
Got it?
You may leave now.

2528
01:56:42,562 --> 01:56:44,530
Well, where are you coming from?

2529
01:56:45,031 --> 01:56:45,998
From Kumbalam.

2530
01:56:47,033 --> 01:56:48,000
Kumbalam?

2531
01:56:49,102 --> 01:56:50,069
Come. Let's go.

2532
01:56:53,306 --> 01:56:54,273
Hey!

2533
01:56:54,340 --> 01:56:55,329
They have left!

2534
01:56:55,408 --> 01:56:58,002
- What are you doing there?
- What will he do? He'll be on Facebook!

2535
01:57:03,883 --> 01:57:05,874
(Grumbling)

2536
01:57:05,952 --> 01:57:06,976
What happened?

2537
01:57:07,353 --> 01:57:08,855
Why are you wearing black?

2538
01:57:08,855 --> 01:57:10,618
Why don't you cover me
with it when l die?

2539
01:57:39,852 --> 01:57:40,910
Check your WhatsApp.

2540
01:57:45,992 --> 01:57:48,119
lf l wear make-up, l will
also look beautiful, Chetta.

2541
01:57:56,536 --> 01:57:59,733
This is the first time l'm coming
out with a girl.

2542
01:58:01,107 --> 01:58:02,734
This is not tasty, right?

2543
01:58:02,842 --> 01:58:05,436
Let's order that thing which has
chocolate poured over a 'Vada'?

2544
01:58:06,012 --> 01:58:06,979
You mean a doughnut?

2545
01:58:07,180 --> 01:58:08,875
ls it called doughnut?
- Yes.

2546
01:58:09,682 --> 01:58:11,084
Shall we orderthat?
- Okay.

2548
01:58:14,153 --> 01:58:15,120
Chetta!

2549
01:58:20,660 --> 01:58:21,922
An umbrella?

2550
01:58:22,195 --> 01:58:24,060
Chetta, get us two ronuts!

2551
01:58:26,899 --> 01:58:28,093
Two ronuts!
- Ronut?

2552
01:58:28,768 --> 01:58:29,735
You mean doughnut?

2553
01:58:30,503 --> 01:58:31,731
What's there to laugh?

2554
01:58:36,509 --> 01:58:38,977
l have planned to go
for a movie as well.

2555
01:58:39,145 --> 01:58:40,373

2556
01:58:40,546 --> 01:58:41,513

We can go & come back soon!

2562
01:58:51,124 --> 01:58:52,523
Soon? Afterthe movie?

2563
01:59:16,883 --> 01:59:17,850

Team DrC

2567
01:59:39,639 --> 01:59:41,903
What is this new game, Baijuetta?

2568
01:59:42,208 --> 01:59:43,505
That's called shot put!

2569
01:59:43,576 --> 01:59:45,737
Get some peanut curry!
lt will be a great combination!

2570

Right, dear?

Oh! l'll bring it!

2574
02:00:03,296 --> 02:00:05,230
Sudheesh, you can bowl.
- Okay.

2575
02:00:07,967 --> 02:00:09,867
Why is your face like this?

2576
02:00:09,936 --> 02:00:11,528
Your love flopped?
- Get lost.

2577
02:00:12,071 --> 02:00:14,005
You just have the looks!

2578
02:00:14,207 --> 02:00:16,072
When they get to know
you better, that's it!

2579
02:00:19,512 --> 02:00:20,274
Oops!

2580
02:00:22,315 --> 02:00:23,783
Can you get that shuttlecock?

2581
02:00:23,783 --> 02:00:25,876
Sorry. A catch is about to come.
l'm waiting for it.

2582
02:00:25,952 --> 02:00:27,146
l don't want to miss it!

2583
02:00:27,220 --> 02:00:29,688
- Will it come any time soon?
- Yes. lt will!

2584
02:00:34,627 --> 02:00:35,594
Over here.

2585
02:00:35,962 --> 02:00:36,929
Baijuetta,

2586
02:00:37,697 --> 02:00:39,096
- What?
- Just a minute.

2587
02:00:41,300 --> 02:00:44,531
Our Alwin's mom..
She had some disease.

2588
02:00:45,972 --> 02:00:48,907
She was taken to the hospital
when her nose started bleeding.

2589
02:00:49,642 --> 02:00:51,303
She died at the hospital.
- Oh God!

2590
02:00:54,113 --> 02:00:56,081
Can you take him to his house?

2591
02:00:56,549 --> 02:00:57,516
Okay.

2592
02:00:57,617 --> 02:00:59,949
Tell it gradually to the kids.
l'll take him.

2593
02:01:00,886 --> 02:01:02,751
Alwin!
Alwin!

2594
02:01:03,322 --> 02:01:04,721
Come here!

2595
02:01:07,994 --> 02:01:10,830
l want to talk to your dad.
You come with me.

2596
02:01:10,830 --> 02:01:12,698
Why should l come for that?

2597
02:01:12,698 --> 02:01:13,722
Just come.

2598
02:01:13,933 --> 02:01:16,168
Whatever l want to tell
dad, l say it to my mom.

2599
02:01:16,168 --> 02:01:17,760
And she says that to dad.

2600
02:01:17,837 --> 02:01:19,338
Why don't you say
it directly to dad?

2601
02:01:19,338 --> 02:01:21,040
Sometimes he gets really angry.

2602
02:01:21,040 --> 02:01:22,769
You carry on, Baijuetta.
Let me play.

2603
02:01:22,875 --> 02:01:23,899
Just come with me.

2604
02:01:24,310 --> 02:01:26,608
l heard your mom was taken to
the hospital in the afternoon.

2605
02:01:26,712 --> 02:01:27,906
You weren't told about it?

2606
02:01:31,617 --> 02:01:32,948
Alwin, stop!

2607
02:01:35,821 --> 02:01:38,619
(Christian prayer song)

2608
02:02:18,230 --> 02:02:20,399
She was really young, right?
- Yes.

2609
02:02:20,399 --> 02:02:21,764
What was she suffering from?

2610
02:02:22,201 --> 02:02:23,725
l just know that she
was hospitalized.

2611
02:02:25,204 --> 02:02:26,694
Don't you remember me?

2612
02:02:27,073 --> 02:02:28,404
Why are you asking that?

2613
02:02:28,841 --> 02:02:32,106
Since you're always angry at me, l
thought you would've forgotten me.

2614
02:02:32,278 --> 02:02:33,245
No.

2615
02:02:34,447 --> 02:02:35,880
Where is Bijila now?

2616
02:02:36,649 --> 02:02:38,742
Bijila got married.
She is here in Kumbalam only.

2617
02:02:40,353 --> 02:02:41,718
This is my daughter.

2618
02:02:41,921 --> 02:02:43,047
Which grade are you in?

2619
02:02:43,122 --> 02:02:44,384
12th grade.

2620
02:02:45,991 --> 02:02:47,390
Shall we leave?
- Okay.

2621
02:02:48,027 --> 02:02:48,994
Bye.

2622
02:02:56,802 --> 02:02:57,937
Where are you, dear?

2623
02:02:57,937 --> 02:02:59,372

2627
02:03:06,312 --> 02:03:08,814

lPL?
That's superb!

2630
02:03:12,084 --> 02:03:13,984
Are you leaving?
We need a treat!

2631
02:03:14,153 --> 02:03:16,789
Come! Let's go to the canteen.
- Not in our canteen!

2632
02:03:16,789 --> 02:03:17,756
l'm ready!

2633
02:03:18,023 --> 02:03:21,220
But today, l can't sleep if
l don't play with my boys!

2634
02:03:21,460 --> 02:03:22,757
l am that happy!

2635
02:03:22,828 --> 02:03:24,056
l'll give you the
treat tomorrow.

2636
02:03:24,930 --> 02:03:25,988
Chechi, one garland.

2637

Thirty rupees.
- Here you go!

2638
02:03:32,838 --> 02:03:39,004
''Kumbalam boys can now play how
much ever cricket they want to!''

2639
02:03:39,078 --> 02:03:40,443
Stop! Stop!

2640
02:03:40,946 --> 02:03:41,935
Come.

2641
02:03:42,014 --> 02:03:43,182
Call all the kids too!

2642
02:03:43,182 --> 02:03:45,776
Baijuetta, are you going to
be the Captain there as well?

2643
02:03:45,885 --> 02:03:46,977
l am too old.

2644
02:03:47,052 --> 02:03:49,919
You could've been one otherwise, right?
- Everyone stand behind him.

2645
02:03:52,324 --> 02:03:53,791
Superb!
- Shall we start?

2646
02:03:53,893 --> 02:03:54,860
Okay!

2647
02:03:56,796 --> 02:03:57,763
Start!

2648
02:03:59,231 --> 02:04:00,994
''Did you know?''

2649
02:04:01,066 --> 02:04:06,172
''Our Harikuttan got
selected for the lPL''

2650
02:04:06,172 --> 02:04:13,044
''Kumbalam boys can now play how
much ever cricket they want to!''

2651
02:04:20,252 --> 02:04:21,844
Enough! Stop it!

2652
02:04:22,188 --> 02:04:25,749
l want to talk. Prakash, connect the mic!
- Why is he showing off for Hari's win?

2653
02:04:31,430 --> 02:04:32,488
Dear friends,

2654
02:04:33,899 --> 02:04:36,424
The pride of Kumbalam
Brothers, Hari Kumbalam;

2655
02:04:37,169 --> 02:04:39,865
is going to play for Royal
Challengers in the lPL.

2656
02:04:42,975 --> 02:04:44,340
From our small playground,

2657
02:04:45,044 --> 02:04:46,773
underthe Captaincy
of Baiju Kumbalam,

2658
02:04:47,246 --> 02:04:48,873
Hari has become a national player.

2659
02:04:48,981 --> 02:04:50,141
And l'm proud about that!

2660
02:04:53,419 --> 02:04:55,221
For that, as a Captain,

2661
02:04:55,221 --> 02:04:58,554
you have honoured me with this
garland & band performance.

2662
02:04:59,058 --> 02:05:02,152
This makes me responsible to
nurture more stars from here.

2663
02:05:04,163 --> 02:05:05,289
Let me add one more thing.

2664
02:05:05,364 --> 02:05:07,525
Even though there's a lot of
time before the lPL starts,

2665
02:05:07,600 --> 02:05:09,802
On the days when Hari is playing,

2666
02:05:09,802 --> 02:05:12,532
there will be a free screening on the
big screen in our small playground!

2667
02:05:14,340 --> 02:05:15,574
Thank you everyone.

2668
02:05:15,574 --> 02:05:17,007
Mic off!

2669
02:05:17,076 --> 02:05:19,408
Baijuetta, he's asking for the mic?
Should l connect?

2670
02:05:19,478 --> 02:05:21,469
Go ahead! lt's his wish, right?
l'm happy!

2671
02:05:25,384 --> 02:05:26,578
We have a special announcement.

2672
02:05:26,919 --> 02:05:29,353
For every club member who
participated in this function,

2673
02:05:29,622 --> 02:05:33,183
there will be an awesome treat by
our Captain, at Vasu's tea shop!

2674
02:05:34,426 --> 02:05:35,552
That's great!

2675
02:05:36,462 --> 02:05:37,895
Since l am happy today,

2676
02:05:38,230 --> 02:05:39,288
it's fine.
Come!

2677
02:05:45,404 --> 02:05:47,133
4 Parottas and two
beef curries for me.

2678
02:05:47,540 --> 02:05:49,108
Come inside only if you have money.

2679
02:05:49,108 --> 02:05:50,234
Wait till l finish eating.

2680
02:05:50,309 --> 02:05:52,436
l will kick you
if you don't pay!

2681
02:05:55,648 --> 02:05:57,275
l want to talk to you, Baiju.

2682
02:05:57,349 --> 02:05:58,350
Right now?

2683
02:05:58,350 --> 02:06:02,087
Not now. Tell me when you're free.
l'll come home or wherever you want me to.

2684
02:06:02,087 --> 02:06:04,456
l'll come to your house.
Today evening or tomorrow morning.

2685
02:06:04,456 --> 02:06:06,014
-Aren't you coming?
- Yes. Coming!

2686
02:06:08,027 --> 02:06:11,155
Ever since he was child,
he was closer to her.

2687
02:06:12,364 --> 02:06:14,559
Now that she's gone,
he is all alone.

2688
02:06:16,101 --> 02:06:17,227
He is silent all the time.

2689
02:06:18,404 --> 02:06:19,462
And no interest in anything.

2690
02:06:20,172 --> 02:06:21,400
lsn't he going to school?

2691
02:06:21,941 --> 02:06:23,238
He is going to school.

2692
02:06:24,176 --> 02:06:26,041
But when he comes back from school,

2693
02:06:26,445 --> 02:06:28,140
he opens his books;

2694
02:06:29,181 --> 02:06:30,546
and keeps studying all the time!

2695
02:06:32,151 --> 02:06:34,176
When the other kids
called him to play today,

2696
02:06:34,687 --> 02:06:36,177
he said he's not going.

2697
02:06:37,323 --> 02:06:38,415
Don't worry, Sir.

2698
02:06:39,325 --> 02:06:41,293
He would still be in that shock.

2699
02:06:42,161 --> 02:06:43,287
Everything will be all right.

2700
02:06:44,163 --> 02:06:47,599
lf l have hurt you in any way,

2701
02:06:47,666 --> 02:06:49,099
please forgive me.

2702
02:06:49,702 --> 02:06:51,602
Can you please take
him to play there?

2703
02:06:54,006 --> 02:06:54,973
Of course!

He is an all-rounder!

2727

No problem!

2728
02:09:07,806 --> 02:09:09,103

Ya! Over there!

02:09:24,823 --> 02:09:26,381
What are you doing?

2732
02:09:26,725 --> 02:09:28,215
You shouldn't throw like that!

2733
02:09:28,293 --> 02:09:29,760
Aim & throw!
Look!

02:09:29,828 --> 02:09:32,296

to learn from matches we lose.

2747
02:10:19,812 --> 02:10:21,177
ls it sweet enough?

2748
02:10:22,648 --> 02:10:27,381
'We can hearthe song of the
bull across the muddy path'

2749
02:10:27,853 --> 02:10:29,822
Are you adding poison to water?
You dog!

2750
02:10:29,822 --> 02:10:33,559
'You will fly high as a butterfly'

2751
02:10:33,559 --> 02:10:38,519
'To distances unseen'

2752
02:10:42,301 --> 02:10:43,529
Did you inform their parents?

2753
02:10:43,635 --> 02:10:44,863
l'll take them, Sir.

2754
02:10:46,505 --> 02:10:48,871
What should l do if l see
him mixing poison in water?

2755
02:10:48,941 --> 02:10:50,203
l lost my control.

2756
02:10:53,612 --> 02:10:54,601
Wait here.

2757
02:11:00,719 --> 02:11:03,517
'Don't play cricket &
football in the play area'

2758
02:11:03,755 --> 02:11:04,779
Then where will you play?

2759
02:11:04,857 --> 02:11:06,791
lt's forthe little
kids to run around!

2760
02:11:12,531 --> 02:11:14,533
You can leave now.
Mom will scold me.

2761
02:11:14,533 --> 02:11:15,591
Will she scold me too?

2762
02:11:15,667 --> 02:11:16,634
l don't know!

2763
02:11:17,769 --> 02:11:18,827
Did mom come?

2764
02:11:18,971 --> 02:11:20,666
Yes. She is waiting.

2765
02:11:20,739 --> 02:11:21,706
Hi Baijuetta!

2766
02:11:27,646 --> 02:11:29,273
You brought a bag?

2767
02:11:29,648 --> 02:11:31,717
Why didn't you tell me when
l came in the morning?

2768
02:11:31,717 --> 02:11:33,241
Ajitha told me that
you're on leave today.

2769
02:11:33,318 --> 02:11:35,878
Yes. Guests are coming home.

2770
02:11:36,655 --> 02:11:39,180
lsn't this Balakrishnan Chettan's duty?
lsn't he home?

2771
02:11:39,291 --> 02:11:40,417
Dad has a slight fever.

2772
02:11:43,462 --> 02:11:45,692
What is this?
Coconut milk powder?.

2773
02:11:45,931 --> 02:11:48,195
That too, when we have enough
coconuts & grinders?

2774
02:11:48,300 --> 02:11:51,463
lt's easy! You just have to
mix it in water. That's all!

2775
02:11:51,637 --> 02:11:53,832
You get everything like this.
See this Chappathi.

2776
02:11:56,308 --> 02:12:00,472
l heard that Baiju Kumbalam's boys
beat up some juice shop owner.

2777
02:12:00,846 --> 02:12:03,440
And there was news on TVthat
they were caught by the Police.

2778
02:12:04,383 --> 02:12:06,681
People don't hesitate to
add poison to food now.

2779
02:12:07,419 --> 02:12:09,478
They don't value our
health or our lives!

2780
02:12:09,554 --> 02:12:11,385
And l'm the one who gets
blamed for that too!

2781
02:12:11,456 --> 02:12:12,958
As if l took the
kids to beat him up!

2782
02:12:12,958 --> 02:12:15,222
Some people will always get
something to show off!

2783
02:12:15,327 --> 02:12:17,557
They would get beaten
up only by those kids.

2784
02:12:17,729 --> 02:12:20,391
Those who buy weed & alcohol buy
it knowing that it's harmful.

2785
02:12:20,933 --> 02:12:23,435
People who mix poison in
juices should be killed, not beaten.

2786
02:12:23,435 --> 02:12:25,926
What do you get without
poison these days?

2787
02:12:26,004 --> 02:12:28,564
Baijuetta,
l've saved your honour.

2788
02:12:28,874 --> 02:12:29,841
l need a treat.

2789
02:12:30,375 --> 02:12:31,774
The entrance rank list is out.

2790
02:12:31,843 --> 02:12:33,245
l cleared the engineering test.

2791
02:12:33,245 --> 02:12:34,713
That's awesome!

2792
02:12:34,713 --> 02:12:36,340
Congratulations.
- Thank you!

2793
02:12:36,415 --> 02:12:37,882
Sweets from Mr Kumbalam.

2794
02:12:37,983 --> 02:12:38,984
Here you go!

2795
02:12:38,984 --> 02:12:40,008
Who else cleared the test?

2796
02:12:40,252 --> 02:12:42,652
Who else..
Ya. Deepa cleared.

2797
02:12:42,854 --> 02:12:44,412
Then Raghavan.

2798
02:12:45,290 --> 02:12:46,985
But Prince,
he couldn't clear it.

2799
02:12:47,292 --> 02:12:48,259
How come?

2800
02:12:48,393 --> 02:12:49,917
He was the who who
studied day & night!

2801
02:12:50,729 --> 02:12:52,663
Deepa is the girl who's
always with Prince.

2802
02:12:52,731 --> 02:12:53,865
Who's Raghavan?
Do l know him?

2803
02:12:53,865 --> 02:12:55,267
You have seen him.

2804
02:12:55,267 --> 02:12:56,301
So,

2805
02:12:56,301 --> 02:12:59,930
won't there be a honouring function & cash
award for the winners from the club?

2806
02:13:00,005 --> 02:13:01,073
We need funds, right?

2807
02:13:01,073 --> 02:13:02,674
Didn't you give it last year?

2808
02:13:02,674 --> 02:13:04,539
So you should definitely
give it this time too!

2809
02:13:05,010 --> 02:13:06,637
l have some urgent work.
Bye.

2810
02:13:09,581 --> 02:13:11,708
l had told Raviettan that l'll
go there in the morning.

2811
02:13:12,084 --> 02:13:14,386
Sreekala, can you buy these
things & drop them home?

2812
02:13:14,386 --> 02:13:16,286
- Yea l will.
- Chetta, add it in my account!

2813
02:13:17,656 --> 02:13:18,623
Ravietta,

2814
02:13:18,690 --> 02:13:21,659
l let Vineeth go alone because l
know you would take care of him.

2815
02:13:22,094 --> 02:13:24,528
How can l go everywhere along
with the kids, Chetta?

2816
02:13:24,663 --> 02:13:25,630
l have a job, right?

2817
02:13:26,698 --> 02:13:28,667
And he doesn't have any
problems like you think.

2818
02:13:28,667 --> 02:13:30,259
He reacts very emotionally.

2819
02:13:30,669 --> 02:13:32,330
That's because his heart is pure.

2820
02:13:32,471 --> 02:13:34,701
lf you consider it as a quality,
there's nothing to worry.

2821
02:13:35,674 --> 02:13:37,539
How are your parents, Baiju?

2822
02:13:37,843 --> 02:13:39,640
Dad has a slight
fever since morning.

2823
02:13:40,012 --> 02:13:41,980
lt's because of this weather.
Everyone has it.

2824
02:13:42,080 --> 02:13:43,081
True.

2825
02:13:43,081 --> 02:13:44,816
Aren't you coming to
bathe in the river?

2826
02:13:44,816 --> 02:13:47,376
No. He's not.
And you don't have to go either.

2827
02:13:47,953 --> 02:13:50,355
He wants to bathe in the
river with his friends now.

2828
02:13:50,355 --> 02:13:53,688
Don't go anywhere without Baijuettan.
Wherever it is.

2829
02:13:53,825 --> 02:13:54,951
l can go if he comes, right?

2830
02:13:55,327 --> 02:13:57,295
Take that with you!
- Take it yourself!

2831
02:13:58,030 --> 02:14:00,032
He is 26 years old now.

2832
02:14:00,032 --> 02:14:02,432
Do you think he has the
maturity of that age?

2833
02:14:02,768 --> 02:14:04,770
Then how can you say that
there's nothing to worry?

2834
02:14:04,770 --> 02:14:06,931
Don't expect too
much maturity at 26.

2835
02:14:07,139 --> 02:14:08,940
He is matured
enough for his age.

2836
02:14:08,940 --> 02:14:11,534
lf he learns some trickery & stupidity,
he'll be like everyone else.

2837
02:14:11,610 --> 02:14:13,445
He has changed a lot now.

2838
02:14:13,445 --> 02:14:15,538
When he was younger, he
used to be really adamant!

2839
02:14:15,781 --> 02:14:18,443
He wouldn't keep calm until
he got what he wanted.

2840
02:14:18,750 --> 02:14:21,913
After he started playing with
the kids, all that has changed.

2841
02:14:21,987 --> 02:14:24,114
Yes. He took a wicket
during the last tournament.

2842
02:14:24,456 --> 02:14:26,117
1 7 runs too, including a boundary.

2843
02:14:26,725 --> 02:14:28,716
Green gram powder for you
and soap for me.

2844
02:14:29,828 --> 02:14:31,625
Vineeth, listen to me.
Come here!

2845
02:14:31,763 --> 02:14:33,424
Baijuettan will come.
He's lying to you!

2846
02:14:33,899 --> 02:14:35,958
No one is as clever as
him in the village.

2847
02:14:38,003 --> 02:14:39,061
l'm leaving, Chetta.

2848
02:14:42,107 --> 02:14:43,074
Unnietta..

2849
02:14:43,975 --> 02:14:45,135
Do you want some 'Kumbilappam'?

2850
02:14:47,012 --> 02:14:49,810
l just saw a scene like
this in a movie on TV.

2851
02:14:50,115 --> 02:14:52,083
So? Can't you eat a
Kumbilappam or what?

2852
02:14:54,986 --> 02:14:56,721
l had gone for a wedding
recently, right?

2853
02:14:56,721 --> 02:14:58,123
They had come to
meet me yesterday.

2854
02:14:58,123 --> 02:14:59,090
l heard that.

2855
02:15:00,992 --> 02:15:02,118
You weren't here?

2856
02:15:03,728 --> 02:15:06,094
There was one among them who saw
me at the wedding & liked me.

2857
02:15:07,165 --> 02:15:08,928
They came to propose
an alliance as well!

2858
02:15:10,702 --> 02:15:12,067
Mom has almost decided on it.

2859
02:15:13,839 --> 02:15:15,864
She said that she doesn't
want to know my opinion.

2860
02:15:18,910 --> 02:15:21,037
l don't know how you
got into my heart!

2861
02:15:23,081 --> 02:15:24,048
Hereafter,

2862
02:15:24,983 --> 02:15:28,146
Hereafter, l won't come behind
you to disturb or tease you.

2863
02:15:29,955 --> 02:15:30,922
Like mom says,

2864
02:15:31,857 --> 02:15:33,722
There's no point in
being in a dream-world.

2865
02:15:34,693 --> 02:15:35,990
l'll get only what's
meant for me.

2866
02:15:39,197 --> 02:15:41,688
Everyone here tried to get
you married to me, right?

2867
02:15:43,001 --> 02:15:43,968
And, now...

2868
02:15:45,871 --> 02:15:47,429
l will marry you!

2869
02:15:48,206 --> 02:16:01,711
Team DrC

2870
02:16:02,454 --> 02:16:05,048
You haven't talked to me for days.
Did l make such a big mistake?

2871
02:16:06,491 --> 02:16:08,925
Every guy wishes to hold the
hands of the girl he loves.

2872
02:16:09,628 --> 02:16:11,220
l don't think that's
such a big mistake.

2873
02:16:14,799 --> 02:16:16,460
- Manoj, throw the ball.

2874
02:16:17,736 --> 02:16:19,465
Take singles.
- Baijuetta!

2875
02:16:19,871 --> 02:16:22,169
l got admission for BDS
& she got for BAMS.

2876
02:16:22,274 --> 02:16:24,209
Why aren't we
getting any medals?

2877
02:16:24,209 --> 02:16:25,836
ls it only for those
who got MBBS?

2878
02:16:26,545 --> 02:16:28,740
Manoj, we have to buy
medals for 2 more people.

2879
02:16:28,880 --> 02:16:30,905
Why didn't you add them?
- MBBS or Engineering?

2880
02:16:30,982 --> 02:16:36,887
BDS and BAMS. Don't we need
Dentists and Ayurvedic Doctors?

2881
02:16:37,022 --> 02:16:39,047
Don't worry.
You will also get medals.

2882
02:16:39,224 --> 02:16:40,521
This is the last ball, right?

2883
02:17:10,622 --> 02:17:11,884
Sir, l didn't get who you are.

2884
02:17:13,992 --> 02:17:15,721
We are the owners of this place.

2885
02:17:15,794 --> 02:17:17,329
Who are you to
Varghese from America?

2886
02:17:17,329 --> 02:17:18,591
Varghese?

2887
02:17:18,730 --> 02:17:21,633
This place belongs to Varghese
Puthumana, who is in America.

2888
02:17:21,633 --> 02:17:23,260
l think you're mistaken
about the property.

2889
02:17:23,969 --> 02:17:27,038
A hospital is going to come up
here, built by MR trading group.

2890
02:17:27,038 --> 02:17:28,607
lt's a Singapore based company.

2891
02:17:28,607 --> 02:17:29,767
She is the company's CEO.

2892
02:17:29,874 --> 02:17:31,136
l am the project manager.

2893
02:17:31,876 --> 02:17:32,968
Okay.
See you.

2894
02:17:42,287 --> 02:17:43,254
Hospital?

2895
02:17:44,155 --> 02:17:45,782
Don't tell the kids now.

2896
02:17:46,124 --> 02:17:47,926
lt will take a lot of time.
Come, let's play!

2897
02:17:47,926 --> 02:17:49,294
Who was it, Baijuetta?

2898
02:17:49,294 --> 02:17:50,659
No one!
Let's play!

2899
02:18:03,141 --> 02:18:04,665
So, when is the wedding?

2900
02:18:04,876 --> 02:18:07,344
Unniettan's parents want it
to happen before the rains.

2901
02:18:08,146 --> 02:18:09,841
You can do it soon.

2902
02:18:10,015 --> 02:18:12,347
Unni has been looking
for a girl for so long!

2903
02:18:13,184 --> 02:18:14,811
What are you doing, Baijuetta?

2904
02:18:15,754 --> 02:18:16,721
Don't cut it so thickly!

2905
02:18:17,122 --> 02:18:18,111
Look at this.

2906
02:18:18,189 --> 02:18:19,952
lt's just one fourth the
size of that piece.

2907
02:18:20,025 --> 02:18:21,549
l'm not cutting!
l quit!

2908
02:18:21,660 --> 02:18:23,595
Who asked you to cut it?

2909
02:18:23,595 --> 02:18:25,586
l was just sitting here to
listen to her love story.

2910
02:18:25,664 --> 02:18:26,665
Janaki!

2911
02:18:26,665 --> 02:18:27,632
Ajitha!

2912
02:18:28,233 --> 02:18:29,996
Bijila is hospitalized.

2913
02:18:30,068 --> 02:18:32,730
Oh God! There's still time for
her delivery date, right?

2914
02:18:32,871 --> 02:18:34,634
Come fast.
Get ready.

2915
02:18:35,173 --> 02:18:37,801
l am really worried.
- Come fast!

2916
02:18:38,777 --> 02:18:41,007
- Oh God! What
happened to my child?

2917
02:18:41,713 --> 02:18:43,271
Sreekala, you will
be here, right?

2918
02:18:43,348 --> 02:18:44,372
Babitha has tuition today.

2919
02:18:44,616 --> 02:18:46,051
She will be back by 6.30-7 PM.

2920
02:18:46,051 --> 02:18:47,678
Don't go, okay?
- l will stay.

2921
02:18:49,220 --> 02:18:51,017
The patient called Bijila.

2922
02:18:51,756 --> 02:18:53,621
She has been taken to the
hospital in the city.

2923
02:18:53,725 --> 02:18:54,953
Which hospital?

2924
02:18:55,026 --> 02:18:56,161
l don't know.

2925
02:18:56,161 --> 02:18:57,890
Which hospital?
- Some hospital in the city.

2926
02:18:58,063 --> 02:18:59,130
Let's call them.

2927
02:18:59,130 --> 02:19:01,598
Calls are not going through.
- Let's keep trying on our way.

2928
02:19:06,671 --> 02:19:08,400
The surgery is over.
lt's a boy!

2929
02:19:08,640 --> 02:19:09,741
Can we see them?

2930
02:19:09,741 --> 02:19:12,043
Not now. The baby has been
shifted to the incubator.

2931
02:19:12,043 --> 02:19:14,170
We need AB+ blood.
ls there someone?

2932
02:19:14,279 --> 02:19:15,940
Her blood group is B+, right?

2933
02:19:16,047 --> 02:19:17,275
Not the mother.
lt's for the baby.

2934
02:19:24,089 --> 02:19:25,386
Tighten your fists!

2935
02:19:40,305 --> 02:19:44,105
Doctors are saying that the baby should be
kept in the incubator for at least a month.

2936
02:19:45,944 --> 02:19:47,912
Bijila would be shifted
to the room tomorrow.

2937
02:19:48,079 --> 02:19:49,444
There is nothing else to worry.

2938
02:19:49,748 --> 02:19:51,909
So they will be discharged
only after a month?

2939
02:19:52,117 --> 02:19:54,210
We should take turns
to stay here.

2940
02:19:54,419 --> 02:19:56,054
One month is fine, mom!

2941
02:19:56,054 --> 02:19:58,386
We got both of them back without
any other problems, right?

2942
02:19:58,757 --> 02:20:01,385
lt is sad that there's no good
hospital in our Kumbalam.

2943
02:20:06,231 --> 02:20:09,029
When the Murukkupuzha Bridge
project is becoming a reality,

2944
02:20:09,100 --> 02:20:11,466
we should identify the ones
who are trying to stop it!

2945
02:20:11,903 --> 02:20:15,999
The new road which connects two nearby
towns, passes through Kumbalam;

2946
02:20:16,174 --> 02:20:19,905
We should realize that it is a royal
path towards development.

2947
02:20:20,178 --> 02:20:21,110
Hey!

2948
02:20:21,212 --> 02:20:25,410
Tell Baiju that l won't be getting
life imprisonment for this!

2949
02:20:25,483 --> 02:20:27,280
l will rip him apart!

2950
02:20:27,986 --> 02:20:29,010
Did you hear me?

2951
02:20:33,725 --> 02:20:34,692
Were you hurt?

2952
02:20:34,759 --> 02:20:36,693
Why does he want to rip me apart?

2953
02:20:36,895 --> 02:20:37,896
What did l do?

2954
02:20:37,896 --> 02:20:40,057
Can't you act like Pink Panther
and take credit for it?

2955
02:20:40,231 --> 02:20:42,722
Come to the point.
l have hospital duty today.

2956
02:20:42,801 --> 02:20:44,393
My parents can come back
only if l go there.

2957
02:20:44,469 --> 02:20:46,903
Do you have night duty today?
Hari's match is on TV tonight.

2958
02:20:47,172 --> 02:20:48,867
You guys watch.
l'll try to come.

2959
02:20:54,979 --> 02:20:56,139
What is it, Bhaskaran Chetta?

2960
02:20:56,915 --> 02:20:59,315
Hari told me that your
sister is hospitalized.

2961
02:21:01,152 --> 02:21:02,983
Here's 25,000 Rupees.
Keep it.

2962
02:21:03,087 --> 02:21:05,453
l'll take back the money l spent.
l don't want anything more.

2963
02:21:06,024 --> 02:21:07,058
Baijuetta,

2964
02:21:07,058 --> 02:21:10,323
let's take the balance as Bhaskaran
Sir's finance company's sponsorship.

2965
02:21:10,495 --> 02:21:13,123
Our club is honouring students
who cleared the entrance tests.

2966
02:21:13,431 --> 02:21:16,161
One gold coin and a flex
sponsored by your company!

2967
02:21:16,334 --> 02:21:17,426
You have to give that!

2968
02:21:17,569 --> 02:21:20,003
l will give this.
l kept this aside for that!

2969
02:21:20,839 --> 02:21:21,840
And,

2970
02:21:21,840 --> 02:21:24,536
l'll send the design forthe flex.
l don't have time to check it.

2971
02:21:24,809 --> 02:21:25,776
l'm busy now.

2972
02:21:27,078 --> 02:21:29,247
Shouldn't he say that
he will be with us?

2973
02:21:29,247 --> 02:21:30,737
What kind of a man is he?

2974
02:21:31,015 --> 02:21:33,040
How did Hari end
up being his son?

2975
02:21:33,952 --> 02:21:35,544
Chameleon Bhaskaran, right?
Let it go!

2976
02:21:36,187 --> 02:21:53,026
Team DrC

2977
02:21:54,072 --> 02:21:55,039
See this.

2978
02:21:56,074 --> 02:21:57,041
Just a minute.

2979
02:21:58,109 --> 02:21:59,076
Hello!

2980
02:21:59,177 --> 02:22:01,771
- Baijuetta, it's me, Hari.
- What is it, Hari? Where are you now?

2981
02:22:02,013 --> 02:22:05,176
l am in Kolkata. l have sent a
photo on WhatsApp. Just check it.

2982
02:22:05,350 --> 02:22:06,317
Just a minute.

2983
02:22:11,523 --> 02:22:14,287
Hari, that's Prince, right?
What happened?

2984
02:22:14,592 --> 02:22:16,560
l stopped him because
l found him familiar.

2985
02:22:17,061 --> 02:22:19,964
He is not saying anything.
l think he ran away from his house.

2986
02:22:19,964 --> 02:22:20,931
ls it?

2987
02:22:21,165 --> 02:22:22,154
Put him on line.

2988
02:22:23,601 --> 02:22:24,568
Aren't you Prince?

2989
02:22:26,204 --> 02:22:27,432
You better tell me the truth.

2990
02:22:27,539 --> 02:22:29,166
Or he'll hand you over to the Police.

2991
02:22:30,208 --> 02:22:32,802
- Yes, l am Prince.
- Okay. Put Hari on line.

2992
02:22:34,178 --> 02:22:36,078
- Tell me, Baijuetta.
- Hari, it's him .

2993
02:22:36,447 --> 02:22:37,573
What should l do?

2994
02:22:37,649 --> 02:22:39,116
When are you coming here?

2995
02:22:39,183 --> 02:22:40,582
l will be coming this week.

2996
02:22:41,052 --> 02:22:42,542
Then bring him back
when you come here.

2997
02:22:43,254 --> 02:22:44,585
Shall l report this
to the Police?

2998
02:22:45,089 --> 02:22:47,489
No, man! No one knows
that he ran away.

2999
02:22:47,959 --> 02:22:49,620
Bring him when you come back.
- Okay.

3000
02:22:50,128 --> 02:22:52,096
- Take care of him.
- Okay.

3001
02:22:54,632 --> 02:22:56,429
Don't you know our Soman Nair?.

3002
02:22:57,201 --> 02:22:59,829
His son ran away from home, and
now Hari found him in Kolkata.

3003
02:23:01,105 --> 02:23:04,472
When everyone comes here from Bengal,
this guy ran away to Bengal!

3004
02:23:07,412 --> 02:23:09,209
Chikku, Silence!

3005
02:23:11,049 --> 02:23:13,142
l'm not saying that you
should tell this to everyone.

3006
02:23:13,318 --> 02:23:16,116
One cannot be smart & intelligent
just by reading books.

3007
02:23:16,187 --> 02:23:17,950
Who are you to advise me ?

3008
02:23:18,056 --> 02:23:19,290
You mind your own business!

3009
02:23:19,290 --> 02:23:22,316
You're not asking if l know anything
about your son who ran away from home.

3010
02:23:22,660 --> 02:23:24,662
Sir, this is called false pride.

3011
02:23:24,662 --> 02:23:26,152
This is called arrogance.

3012
02:23:27,632 --> 02:23:28,599
Chechi,

3013
02:23:28,666 --> 02:23:30,361
Hari found Prince in Calcutta.

3014
02:23:31,135 --> 02:23:34,305
Don't scold him when he comes back.
Give him some love.

3015
02:23:34,305 --> 02:23:36,330
l just felt it would be
good if l say that to you.

3016
02:23:36,407 --> 02:23:38,432
lt's not his fault.
lt is yours alone!

3017
02:23:39,377 --> 02:23:41,607
lf you have God's grace, you
will understand that now.

3018
02:23:42,013 --> 02:23:43,139
l will pray for that as well!

3019
02:23:48,119 --> 02:23:49,086
There he is!

3020
02:23:49,187 --> 02:23:50,154
Hari,

3021
02:23:51,289 --> 02:23:52,654
You're rocking, dude!

3022
02:23:55,360 --> 02:23:56,327
Go!

3023
02:23:57,128 --> 02:23:58,095
Bye.

3024
02:23:59,130 --> 02:24:00,563
- How was the game?
- lt was good.

3025
02:24:05,203 --> 02:24:06,170
Son!

3026
02:24:06,504 --> 02:24:07,994
Where were you, dear?

3027
02:24:08,406 --> 02:24:10,237
Hari?
- Baijuetta!

3028
02:24:11,242 --> 02:24:13,073
Well done, dear!
How are you?

3029
02:24:13,177 --> 02:24:14,144
l am great!

3030
02:24:14,345 --> 02:24:17,007
Did you take pictures with them?
Journalists came & took many!

3031
02:24:17,348 --> 02:24:19,043
Did you see our Sachin?
- Of course!

3032
02:24:20,618 --> 02:24:21,585
Come!

3033
02:24:22,053 --> 02:24:23,020
Get in.

3034
02:24:23,554 --> 02:24:24,646
Won't you come there?

3035
02:24:27,125 --> 02:24:29,355
Baijuettan smoothly
got into the car.

3036
02:24:29,560 --> 02:24:32,529
You should feel like doing this on your
own, not when someone else asks you to.

3037
02:24:32,597 --> 02:24:34,189
That is called love.

3038
02:24:34,265 --> 02:24:37,135
Dad, there's no need to go
to the hospital tonight!

3039
02:24:37,135 --> 02:24:39,270
lt will be a disturbance for
them, in that tiny room!

3040
02:24:39,270 --> 02:24:41,170
l keep walking on the
corridors all the time.

3041
02:24:41,272 --> 02:24:44,002
But you will be there if
there's an emergency, right?

3042
02:24:44,375 --> 02:24:47,640
Can't you go around 7 PM,
after all your work here?

3043
02:24:47,712 --> 02:24:49,646
Whatever you say, l'm
not going tonight!

3044
02:24:50,214 --> 02:24:51,238
Don't argue.

3045
02:24:51,382 --> 02:24:53,009
There is nothing to worry, mom!

3046
02:24:53,785 --> 02:24:56,049
Ajitha, l'm leaving. You
both can come later.

3047
02:24:56,387 --> 02:24:57,649
Dad, l'm also coming with you!

3048
02:24:57,755 --> 02:25:00,451
l am also coming.
- You can come with Sreekala Chechi, mom!

3049
02:25:01,559 --> 02:25:02,548
Hey!

3050
02:25:03,227 --> 02:25:05,695
We are planning to bring
them here from the hospital!

3051
02:25:05,763 --> 02:25:08,027
Don't say that we didn't
ask for your permission!

3052
02:25:09,200 --> 02:25:11,002
Didn't you get
anything else to wear?

3053
02:25:11,002 --> 02:25:13,504
When Murukkumpuzha bridge becomes
a reality with in 5 years,

3054
02:25:13,504 --> 02:25:18,271
we will see Kumbalam going far
ahead in the path of progress.

3055
02:25:18,776 --> 02:25:25,147
Today, we are here to honour the
brilliant students of our Panchayat.

3056
02:25:25,616 --> 02:25:28,210
Why are you standing alone here?
Why aren't you coming there?

3057
02:25:29,287 --> 02:25:31,755
At last, you smiled.
l'm relieved now!

3058
02:25:32,790 --> 02:25:33,757
Manoj,

3059
02:25:35,526 --> 02:25:38,154
What you think is not going
to happen in our case.

3060
02:25:39,063 --> 02:25:41,031
Don't waste time by
coming behind me.

3061
02:25:41,099 --> 02:25:42,657
lnstead, study hard & get a good job!

3062
02:25:44,569 --> 02:25:46,503
God will give you a much
better girl than me.

3063
02:25:46,571 --> 02:25:48,163
Are you trying to advise me?

3064
02:25:48,473 --> 02:25:50,441
No. l am going to be a nun.

3065
02:25:51,275 --> 02:25:52,242
What?

3066
02:25:54,112 --> 02:25:55,179
When l met you,

3067
02:25:55,179 --> 02:25:59,673
l was curious to know how
it is to fall in love.

3068
02:26:00,485 --> 02:26:01,452
l admit that.

3069
02:26:02,720 --> 02:26:06,520
That's something which is not going to
happen, or should not happen in my life.

3070
02:26:06,791 --> 02:26:08,281
What is this?
l am confused.

3071
02:26:09,160 --> 02:26:10,457
No need of any confusion.

3072
02:26:10,695 --> 02:26:12,390
l like you, Manoj.

3073
02:26:13,164 --> 02:26:17,225
But, a love affair or marriage is not
going to happen in my life, Manoj.

3074
02:26:18,336 --> 02:26:19,530
l have to become a nun.

3075
02:26:20,104 --> 02:26:21,765
Don't try to fool me.

3076
02:26:22,306 --> 02:26:26,106
l have heard this dialogue in a movie.
lt was a Mohanlal movie.

3077
02:26:26,444 --> 02:26:28,503
l'll tell you the name of the movie.
One minute.

3078
02:26:28,646 --> 02:26:30,113
l'm not kidding.

3079
02:26:31,616 --> 02:26:34,085
Since they didn't have kids for
a long time after marriage,

3080
02:26:34,085 --> 02:26:36,076
my parents made this
offering to the Church.

3081
02:26:36,721 --> 02:26:38,655
That they will make their
first daughter a nun.

3082
02:26:39,223 --> 02:26:41,157
Only after that, me and Sara were born.

3083
02:26:42,226 --> 02:26:44,490
l have a younger brother, Robin.
He studies in Bangalore.

3084
02:26:45,296 --> 02:26:47,230
Are you really
going to be a nun?

3085
02:26:48,299 --> 02:26:49,266
Yes.

3086
02:26:51,335 --> 02:26:52,768
Dad got a transfer.

3087
02:26:53,738 --> 02:26:55,103
We are vacating this house.

3088
02:26:56,808 --> 02:26:58,673
l was waiting here
to tell this to you.

3089
02:27:26,737 --> 02:27:29,399
l don't know how
to give a speech.

3090
02:27:30,608 --> 02:27:32,838
l was 8 years old when l
started playing on this ground.

3091
02:27:33,377 --> 02:27:35,902
Baijuettan was the one who taught
me how to hold the cricket bat.

3092
02:27:36,547 --> 02:27:41,382
He was the one who taught me that my
elbow shouldn't bend while bowling.

3093
02:27:42,220 --> 02:27:47,715
He bought me a new cricket kit to go for
the selection camp, from his PF loan.

3094
02:27:48,259 --> 02:27:50,386
He made me promise that l
shouldn't tell it to anyone.

3095
02:27:51,696 --> 02:27:53,721
But l had to tell
that to my dad.

3096
02:27:55,399 --> 02:27:56,366
Sorry Etta.

3097
02:27:57,301 --> 02:27:58,268
And thanks.

3098
02:27:59,403 --> 02:28:03,203
Baijuettan, this ground, and
my own brothers here;

3099
02:28:03,875 --> 02:28:07,936
l think about all of you before
l play every single lPL match.

3100
02:28:08,980 --> 02:28:11,915
The confidence that all of
you have me in your prayers.

3101
02:28:12,583 --> 02:28:14,175
That's what kept me going.

3102
02:28:15,419 --> 02:28:17,216
The ones who helped me
reach my dream-land;

3103
02:28:17,455 --> 02:28:18,786
my BFFs;

3104
02:28:19,290 --> 02:28:20,450
Kumbalam Brothers;

3105
02:28:20,791 --> 02:28:21,758
Thanks!

3106
02:28:22,526 --> 02:28:24,221
Thanks for all your
love and prayers!

3107
02:28:25,196 --> 02:28:39,065
Team DrC

3108
02:28:40,311 --> 02:28:41,278
What is this?

3109
02:28:41,846 --> 02:28:42,938
Champa.. Gne?

3110
02:28:43,214 --> 02:28:44,315
Dude, it's champagne!

3111
02:28:44,315 --> 02:28:45,942
Oh! So this is it!

3112
02:28:46,217 --> 02:28:48,549
The thing you open it after
the match, and froth comes out;

3113
02:28:48,653 --> 02:28:50,988
Baijuetta, shake it before opening.
lt will froth up!

3114
02:28:50,988 --> 02:28:52,990
Should we do it?
- No. lt's expensive!

3115
02:28:52,990 --> 02:28:54,787
We can get it for one
Rupee in a small packet.

3116
02:28:54,859 --> 02:28:56,190
- What?
- Shampoo!

3117
02:28:56,294 --> 02:28:57,784
lt's not shampoo!
lt's champagne!

3118
02:28:57,962 --> 02:29:00,556
lt's not for bathing.
lt's for drinking!

3119
02:29:00,765 --> 02:29:01,959
How do l open this?

3120
02:29:06,938 --> 02:29:09,270
Baijuetta, l will leave
tomorrow evening.

3121
02:29:09,874 --> 02:29:11,307
My flight is at 8 PM.

3122
02:29:11,575 --> 02:29:13,440
Then l have a tourfor 2 months.

3123
02:29:14,345 --> 02:29:16,881
Before l leave, shouldn't we play
together, for old times' sake?

3124
02:29:16,881 --> 02:29:18,678
What say?
- Of course!

3125
02:29:19,550 --> 02:29:22,314
lt's an honour to play with you now.
- Stop kidding, bro!

3126
02:29:22,954 --> 02:29:24,478
So let's meet in the morning.

3127
02:29:26,023 --> 02:29:27,615
Have it.

3128
02:29:28,859 --> 02:29:30,019
Why are you silent?

3129
02:29:30,728 --> 02:29:32,787
You've been sitting here like
a squirrel who lost his nuts!

3130
02:29:32,863 --> 02:29:34,387
Baijuetta..

3131
02:29:34,865 --> 02:29:36,423
Don't hurt him further.

3132
02:29:37,668 --> 02:29:40,364
Village officer & family are shifting
from here. He got a transfer.

3133
02:29:40,738 --> 02:29:41,966
That's all?

3134
02:29:42,740 --> 02:29:45,868
He is not getting transferred
to some other planet, right?

3135
02:29:46,077 --> 02:29:49,013
Why else were phones, FB
and WhatsApp invented?

3136
02:29:49,013 --> 02:29:50,640
There's no use for all that.

3137
02:29:50,881 --> 02:29:52,542
Manoj, shall l tell them?

3138
02:29:53,517 --> 02:29:54,506
Go ahead!

3139
02:29:54,752 --> 02:29:56,379
Hey! With your permission.

3140
02:29:57,088 --> 02:29:59,716
She broke up with him saying that
she's going to become a nun.

3141
02:30:00,358 --> 02:30:01,359
What?

3142
02:30:01,359 --> 02:30:03,884
Chetta, Rose is going
to become a nun.

3143
02:30:04,695 --> 02:30:06,060
That's a major shock, bro!

3144
02:30:06,564 --> 02:30:07,997
What happened to her
all of a sudden?

3145
02:30:08,065 --> 02:30:09,828
She was taking him for a ride.

3146
02:30:10,301 --> 02:30:12,701
To be frank, l'm not very
convinced by that story.

3147
02:30:12,970 --> 02:30:14,938
Baijuetta, l'm leaving.
- You sit here.

3148
02:30:16,707 --> 02:30:17,833
Leave it, man!

3149
02:30:18,876 --> 02:30:20,605
Such things happen
in everyone's life.

3150
02:30:21,545 --> 02:30:22,807
Only if we go through all that,

3151
02:30:22,880 --> 02:30:26,083
we will achieve a certain
maturity in life.

3152
02:30:26,083 --> 02:30:27,380
Does it happen to everyone?

3153
02:30:27,451 --> 02:30:28,679
Did you have anything like that?

3154
02:30:29,754 --> 02:30:30,846
Of course!

3155
02:30:30,921 --> 02:30:32,388
ls it?
Who was it?

3156
02:30:33,424 --> 02:30:35,092
l won't say who it is.
Don't ask!

3157
02:30:35,092 --> 02:30:36,923
Considerthat l have a
reason not to say it.

3158
02:30:37,928 --> 02:30:40,556
Forthe time being, l will sing a
song that suits this situation;

3159
02:30:41,365 --> 02:30:42,900
With that this scene should end.

3160
02:30:42,900 --> 02:30:45,494
Don't be emotional about it.
- No.

3161
02:30:45,936 --> 02:30:47,528
Manoj, if you are okay;
l will sing.

3162
02:30:47,705 --> 02:30:49,332
Sing, bro!
He is okay.

3163
02:30:49,573 --> 02:30:50,699
Let him become okay.

3164
02:30:50,941 --> 02:30:53,010
lf not, l don't want
to waste my energy.

3165
02:30:53,010 --> 02:30:55,376
Sing! Please.

3166
02:30:59,083 --> 02:31:00,451
Baijuetta, Sing!

3167
02:31:00,451 --> 02:31:09,416
''Here ends the last scene
of the drama of love''

3168
02:31:10,027 --> 02:31:18,135
''The stage is empty now.
And the audience went their own ways''

3169
02:31:18,135 --> 02:31:19,500
'Kumbalam Brothers'

3170
02:31:19,570 --> 02:31:23,174
''The stage is empty now.
And the audience went their own ways''

3171
02:31:23,174 --> 02:31:27,474
''The stage is empty now.
And the audience went their own ways''

3172
02:31:27,745 --> 02:31:37,711
''The stage is empty now.
And the audience went their own ways''

3173
02:32:04,682 --> 02:32:05,979
What's happening there?

3174
02:32:20,531 --> 02:32:21,866
What is happening here?

3175
02:32:21,866 --> 02:32:23,766
They are going to construct
a hospital here.

3176
02:32:24,702 --> 02:32:39,572
Team DrC

3177
02:32:41,252 --> 02:32:42,219
Dude!

3178
02:32:42,553 --> 02:32:43,520
Dude, it's Jose.

3179
02:32:43,854 --> 02:32:45,890
Dudes!
Arun! Sudheesh!

3180
02:32:45,890 --> 02:32:47,517
You just came?
- Yes.

3181
02:32:47,725 --> 02:32:49,124
Dude, l got fired
from the company.

3182
02:32:50,060 --> 02:32:53,029
l used the idea that
Baijuettan told me.

3183
02:32:53,497 --> 02:32:56,432
l fought with the company. The Arab
got angry and asked me to get going.

3184
02:32:57,601 --> 02:32:58,863
Dubai, it seems!

3185
02:32:59,203 --> 02:33:02,536
l was feeling choked without my
friends & the evening games.

3186
02:33:03,174 --> 02:33:05,540
Why aren't you guys
happy after seeing me?

3187
02:33:05,609 --> 02:33:07,839
Are you going to play?
- l am ready!

3188
02:33:08,712 --> 02:33:10,948
Our Hari is rocking, dude!

3189
02:33:10,948 --> 02:33:13,815
Ya. Hari is here.
We'll be at the ground. Come there.

3190
02:33:13,884 --> 02:33:14,976
Okay.
Come fast.

3191
02:33:15,553 --> 02:33:16,577
Okay.
Bye.

3192
02:33:16,887 --> 02:33:19,219
Why is this place is so crowded?
- Nothing, man!

3193
02:33:23,160 --> 02:33:25,924
Let's go!
l'll play like never before today!

3194
02:33:38,576 --> 02:33:41,238
Stop! Work is going on inside.
You are not supposed to go in.

3195
02:34:07,638 --> 02:34:10,038
Like l said, work shouldn't
be interrupted here.

3196
02:34:13,811 --> 02:34:15,972
Those who've gathered in the
compound should go out.

3197
02:34:18,148 --> 02:34:20,241
All of you should step out.
Please.

3198
02:34:31,328 --> 02:34:32,295
Baijuetta,

3199
02:34:33,197 --> 02:34:35,165
This place is for us to play, right?

3200
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:36,967
Tell them!

3201
02:34:37,167 --> 02:34:38,759
They won't understand it, dear.

3202
02:34:38,936 --> 02:34:39,903
Baiju,

3203
02:34:40,204 --> 02:34:41,762
Take these kids out
of the compound.

3204
02:34:42,006 --> 02:34:43,598
Don't you know everything?
- Yes, Sir.

3205
02:34:45,142 --> 02:34:47,838
Didn't you hear him?
Come! Let's go!

3206
02:35:04,928 --> 02:35:05,895
Baijuetta!

3207
02:35:06,063 --> 02:35:07,963
When did you come?
- Just now.

3208
02:35:11,802 --> 02:35:12,769
Come!

3209
02:35:35,893 --> 02:35:37,190
- Pull the ropes!

3210
02:36:04,922 --> 02:36:06,947
Surendretta, do you feel
bad for losing the ground?

3211
02:36:08,926 --> 02:36:10,223
That was someone's ground!

3212
02:36:10,928 --> 02:36:13,260
We started playing there
without asking them!

3213
02:36:15,132 --> 02:36:17,293
Since the age of 8, for
these 36 years now..

3214
02:36:21,472 --> 02:36:22,439
Hey!

3215
02:36:23,240 --> 02:36:25,868
Hope without disappointment
is called sportsman spirit!

3216
02:36:26,377 --> 02:36:28,777
Sometimes we may fail.
And from that, we learn how to win!

3217
02:36:28,946 --> 02:36:31,847
But we shouldn't be sitting
here with our heads hung in sorrow.

3218
02:36:34,051 --> 02:36:35,313
When l think about it now,

3219
02:36:35,886 --> 02:36:38,855
l had a good pastime with
kids from 4 PM everyday.

3220
02:36:39,890 --> 02:36:41,380
Even l was playing
there with you guys.

3221
02:36:42,459 --> 02:36:43,827
l won't allow this.

3222
02:36:43,827 --> 02:36:45,089
l will get a stay
from the court.

3223
02:36:45,162 --> 02:36:47,027
l won't allow the hospital
to come up there.

3224
02:36:48,132 --> 02:36:49,759
Narayanetta, you
changed sides now?

3225
02:36:51,802 --> 02:36:53,167
Prakash, connect the mic!

3226
02:36:56,373 --> 02:36:58,204
Dad!
- Oh! You were here?

3227
02:37:05,816 --> 02:37:06,840
My dear friends,

3228
02:37:07,718 --> 02:37:09,686
This is not something new.

3229
02:37:11,422 --> 02:37:13,788
We have lost such
playgrounds even earlier.

3230
02:37:15,025 --> 02:37:18,162
And it's good that a hospital is
coming to Kumbalam, right?

3231
02:37:18,162 --> 02:37:19,129
Let it come.

3232
02:37:20,097 --> 02:37:23,863
Everyone wants their kids to
become engineers or doctors.

3233
02:37:25,102 --> 02:37:27,195
For engineers, such buildings
should be constructed.

3234
02:37:28,071 --> 02:37:31,097
For doctors, such hospitals should
come up, and there should be patients.

3235
02:37:32,242 --> 02:37:34,870
lf kids grow up playing,
there won't be many patients.

3236
02:37:36,346 --> 02:37:37,313
Now,

3237
02:37:37,981 --> 02:37:40,176
when it's time to
play every evening;

3238
02:37:42,019 --> 02:37:43,043
We will..

3239
02:37:45,022 --> 02:37:46,421
We will have some trouble.

3240
02:37:47,191 --> 02:37:49,159
But in some time, we will
adjust to a new life.

3241
02:37:54,932 --> 02:37:59,426
Kumbalam Brothers, which consists of these
monkeys who don't respect their Captain;

3242
02:38:04,007 --> 02:38:05,804
And a jobless patron.

3243
02:38:09,179 --> 02:38:10,305
Can l sing a song?

3244
02:38:11,582 --> 02:38:12,549
Old is Gold!

3245
02:38:13,150 --> 02:38:15,219
No, dad.
Let's go home.

3246
02:38:15,219 --> 02:38:16,811
No. l won't bore them!

3247
02:38:19,823 --> 02:38:20,924
Or let it be!

3248
02:38:20,924 --> 02:38:22,016
You play the song!

3249
02:38:26,964 --> 02:38:33,995
''Where is the play-house we
built with sand and oysters?''

3250
02:38:34,071 --> 02:38:38,235
''The play-house we built long back''

3251
02:38:38,342 --> 02:38:41,004
''The sea washed them away''

3252
02:38:42,246 --> 02:38:45,044
''The sea washed them away''

3253
02:38:46,083 --> 02:38:52,921
''We made toy-boats here
with tender leaves''

3254
02:38:53,023 --> 02:38:56,220
''We made toy-boats here''

3255
02:38:57,194 --> 02:38:59,162
''The wind blew them away''

3256
02:38:59,229 --> 02:39:00,787
May the cities grow!

3257
02:39:01,265 --> 02:39:03,893
May the basic facilities in
our villages become better.

3258
02:39:04,401 --> 02:39:05,368
Those are good things.

3259
02:39:06,069 --> 02:39:07,127
Along with that,

3260
02:39:07,204 --> 02:39:08,466
for us to hang out with friends;

3261
02:39:09,206 --> 02:39:11,037
to sit and enjoy the
breeze doing nothing;

3262
02:39:11,475 --> 02:39:12,965
and for our kids to play;

3263
02:39:13,410 --> 02:39:15,105
please leave some space, Sir.

3264
02:39:15,612 --> 02:39:16,909
Without all these,

3265
02:39:16,980 --> 02:39:21,474
where are we rushing to, by widening
roads and building bridges?

3266
02:39:22,486 --> 02:39:24,249
When flats and villas are built,

3267
02:39:24,922 --> 02:39:26,981
when villages are killed to grow cities;

3268
02:39:27,925 --> 02:39:30,018
Why doesn't anyone think
about our kids, Sir?

3269
02:39:31,194 --> 02:39:33,890
Kids need some space
to play, Sir.

3270
02:39:42,639 --> 02:39:46,276
(Request to the Respected
Chief Minister of Kerala)

3271
02:39:46,276 --> 02:39:48,512
(Yours faithfully)

3272
02:39:48,512 --> 02:39:51,072

Patron Baiju.
