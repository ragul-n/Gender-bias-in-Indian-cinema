1
00:02:27,453 --> 00:02:29,478
Extra! Extra!
Read all about it...

2
00:02:30,022 --> 00:02:35,483
Two prisoners want to greet the
president on his birthday.

3
00:02:46,205 --> 00:02:51,575
Do you see the headlines?
Both the convicts are from your jail.

4
00:02:55,914 --> 00:02:59,873
The law keeps an eye on every
breath a convict takes...

5
00:03:00,052 --> 00:03:04,045
Even then, their wishes
not only left their lips...

6
00:03:04,256 --> 00:03:07,919
but slipped out of the bars
to become headlines like this?

7
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:11,457
And we don't know anything!
Who had come to meet them?

8
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,395
Nobody visited them as such.
But a few days ago...

9
00:03:18,604 --> 00:03:22,540
a reporter had come to see them with
a letter from the Home Minister.

10
00:03:23,442 --> 00:03:28,106
The two convicts could have
expressed their wish to him.

11
00:03:30,683 --> 00:03:33,709
Have you heard?
- What's the matter?

12
00:03:35,187 --> 00:03:40,819
See this. The president is
to meet two convicts today.

13
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:44,889
What for?
- God only knows!

14
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,552
Happy Birthday.
- Thank you.

15
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:28,697
The youth are a nation's strength.

16
00:05:28,867 --> 00:05:34,499
They're a nation's future. And,
they're bound and shackled? Why?

17
00:05:34,706 --> 00:05:40,372
These very shackles and handcuffs
will soon be a hangman's noose!

18
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:49,119
You seem delicate as flowers.
What crime did you commit...

19
00:05:49,321 --> 00:05:52,916
to deserve such
a horrible sentence?

20
00:06:19,151 --> 00:06:24,020
''Apply the turmeric
on the Bride...''

21
00:06:24,223 --> 00:06:29,160
''and make her even
more beautiful''

22
00:06:29,361 --> 00:06:36,961
''Apply the turmeric
on the Bride...''

23
00:06:37,169 --> 00:06:42,004
''and sing songs
of happiness''

24
00:06:42,407 --> 00:06:47,344
Stop this merry making and
get her ready for the groom.

25
00:06:47,579 --> 00:06:52,414
Till Suman doesn't Come, l refuse!
- You won't get married for her?

26
00:06:52,784 --> 00:06:56,311
She'll get wed, and go to her
husband's house too! Right, Aunty?

27
00:06:56,755 --> 00:07:01,658
Why come so early? Should've come
after Kanchan became a mother!

28
00:07:01,894 --> 00:07:05,830
Sorry, but the bus broke down.
That's why l got late.

29
00:07:06,031 --> 00:07:10,195
Where's Duryodhan?
- Don't ask, Aunty.

30
00:07:10,402 --> 00:07:14,839
The Duryodhan from our epic
was busy playing chess all day.

31
00:07:15,073 --> 00:07:21,273
And this one, your nephew, is busy
hitting and kicking walls all day!

32
00:07:21,446 --> 00:07:25,143
What! He hits and kicks
at walls? ls he mad?

33
00:07:25,284 --> 00:07:31,245
No..... you know these...
Martial Arts...

34
00:07:31,423 --> 00:07:36,520
He practices all sorts of things.
He's out for fame and money.

35
00:07:36,662 --> 00:07:38,596
Not bothered about
anything or anyone!

36
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:39,924
Oh God!

37
00:07:40,065 --> 00:07:44,126
- Who'll marry him like this?
- Don't lose weight over it!

38
00:07:44,303 --> 00:07:49,502
No girl will marry him, and
nor will be ever be the groom!

39
00:07:51,009 --> 00:07:53,102
There!
The groom's procession is here!

40
00:07:57,349 --> 00:07:59,112
Now hurry and
get this girl ready!

41
00:08:47,899 --> 00:08:49,867
Yes, Aunty?

42
00:08:50,035 --> 00:08:52,663
She's going to garland
the groom. Hurry!

43
00:08:53,038 --> 00:08:54,699
Yes.

44
00:09:07,386 --> 00:09:09,411
Hold this.

45
00:09:11,523 --> 00:09:14,788
Garland the groom, dear.

46
00:09:16,528 --> 00:09:21,488
lf you stoop to her now,
you'll stoop to her all your life!

47
00:09:21,733 --> 00:09:26,193
- Stand straight!
- Look Mr. Groom.

48
00:09:26,371 --> 00:09:29,397
lf you won't stoop,
she'll climb on something!

49
00:09:29,675 --> 00:09:31,233
lt's all the same.

50
00:09:31,376 --> 00:09:33,537
Let him bow down, or
let her climb on something.

51
00:09:37,182 --> 00:09:39,946
- What do you say?
- Meaning?

52
00:09:40,085 --> 00:09:41,575
l mean...

53
00:09:41,787 --> 00:09:45,223
He's standing straight now.
Never to bend forward.

54
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:50,293
But l'm willing to stoop.
Put that garland in my neck.

55
00:09:51,396 --> 00:09:54,229
l admit, you don't have a garland
but you do have arms.

56
00:09:54,433 --> 00:10:01,100
- Put them round my neck.
- Really? Will shoes do instead?

57
00:10:03,742 --> 00:10:05,505
Snake!

58
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:29,126
''That's wonderful''

59
00:10:29,334 --> 00:10:33,031
''We're here to congratulate you''

60
00:10:33,739 --> 00:10:38,005
Quiet! You should be ashamed
to insult somebody like this.

61
00:10:38,243 --> 00:10:42,441
We're from the girl's side, but we
won't tolerate your impudence.

62
00:10:42,647 --> 00:10:48,108
We're entertaining you and you...
Who do you think you are anyway?

63
00:10:52,524 --> 00:10:58,429
lf you wanted entertainment,
we'd have oBliged you free of cost.

64
00:10:59,431 --> 00:11:03,959
l see. So you think
you are Michael Jackson, eh?

65
00:11:04,269 --> 00:11:08,729
Let's see how much oil
there is in this lamp!

66
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:11,500
The lamp has a wick too.

67
00:11:11,643 --> 00:11:15,807
Be my partner? Done?
- Done!

68
00:11:50,448 --> 00:12:00,949
''We're here with the groom
in a procession...''

69
00:12:01,159 --> 00:12:10,659
''we're going to leave
with you''

70
00:12:11,203 --> 00:12:15,264
''We're here in the procession.....''

71
00:12:17,075 --> 00:12:26,746
''We're here with the groom
in a procession...''

72
00:12:26,952 --> 00:12:31,548
''We're going to leave
with you, too''

73
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:36,793
''We're going to leave
with you, too''

74
00:12:39,531 --> 00:12:44,434
''You are here to take away
the bride...''

75
00:12:44,636 --> 00:12:47,127
''You are here to take away
the bride...''

76
00:12:47,539 --> 00:12:50,007
''So take her away''

77
00:12:50,308 --> 00:12:55,075
''Take my advice;
don't clash with me''

78
00:12:55,213 --> 00:12:58,205
''Just don't clash with me''

79
00:13:00,285 --> 00:13:09,455
''We're here with the groom
in a procession...''

80
00:13:42,327 --> 00:13:47,264
''Don't steal a glance like that;
look openly at me''

81
00:13:47,532 --> 00:13:52,435
''Stop being coy...
fall in love with me''

82
00:13:52,837 --> 00:13:57,934
''Don't steal a glance like that...
look openly at me''

83
00:13:58,143 --> 00:14:03,308
''l'd pierce your heart
with hatred''

84
00:14:03,515 --> 00:14:07,918
''What are you going to do,
if l refuse?''

85
00:14:08,053 --> 00:14:12,717
''l'd pierce your heart
with hatred''

86
00:14:13,224 --> 00:14:18,389
''Let me come closer...
and look into your eyes''

87
00:14:18,596 --> 00:14:22,760
''Let's put our hands
in each others''

88
00:14:23,068 --> 00:14:33,603
''We're here with the groom
in a procession...''

89
00:14:33,812 --> 00:14:37,748
''We're here with the groom...''

90
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:21,081
''Why are you acting smart...?
Why are you teasing me?''

91
00:15:21,292 --> 00:15:25,285
''Why are you grabBing my hand?
l'm still a virgin''

92
00:15:25,897 --> 00:15:30,300
''Why are you acting smart...?
Why are you teasing me?''

93
00:15:30,502 --> 00:15:35,269
''You don't understand the
state of my restless heart''

94
00:15:35,507 --> 00:15:40,774
''l'm still unwed only
for you, O fair maiden''

95
00:15:40,945 --> 00:15:45,814
''You don't understand the
state of my restless heart''

96
00:15:46,017 --> 00:15:52,047
''That l will belong to you;
that l will go with you...''

97
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:55,748
''Keep dreaming of that
even when you go back home''

98
00:15:55,960 --> 00:16:05,232
''We're here with the groom
in a procession...''

99
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:10,630
''We're here with the groom
in a procession...''

100
00:16:10,909 --> 00:16:15,869
''We're going to leave
with you, too''

101
00:16:16,481 --> 00:16:20,975
''You're going to leave

102
00:16:24,089 --> 00:16:26,614

00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:29,351
''So take her away''

104
00:16:29,527 --> 00:16:35,193
''Take my advice;

105
00:16:39,237 --> 00:16:41,467
''l'd put the bridal
bangles in your hands''

106
00:16:41,606 --> 00:16:44,006
''l'd summon the cops''

107
00:16:44,142 --> 00:16:46,508
''l'd send for a
veil for you''

''l'd sway with you in my arms
and kiss your cheeks...''

115
00:17:12,737 --> 00:17:16,867
''l'd take you straight
to the prisons''

116
00:17:17,075 --> 00:17:23,742
''We're here with the groom
in a procession...''

117
00:17:23,915 --> 00:17:32,186
''We're here with the groom...''

118
00:17:56,181 --> 00:18:00,550
ls this meant to be eaten, or,
just tasted? Be generous please.

119
00:18:11,429 --> 00:18:14,557
You served me vegetables, but,
what do l eat them with?

120
00:18:18,403 --> 00:18:21,304
You seem to be from
a family of gluttons!

121
00:18:21,539 --> 00:18:24,872
Who, on hearing of a buffet,
hasn't eaten for a week!

122
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:33,916
Here you are. Eat. Have more.
And if you're still hungry, eat me!

123
00:18:34,118 --> 00:18:37,383
You are the dessert.
l'll taste you after having dined.

124
00:18:38,089 --> 00:18:42,651
By the way, you do have
sweetmeats l hope.

125
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:49,561
Of course! We know that the hateful
have a sweet tooth. l'll just get it.

126
00:18:56,441 --> 00:19:00,002
Eat as much as you can.
lt's your wedding-night remember.

127
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:08,215
Here you are.
Now please eat.

128
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,112
- So small?
- What?

129
00:19:12,257 --> 00:19:14,851
l mean they're so small,
l'll eat two hundred!

130
00:19:14,993 --> 00:19:16,426
Two aren't enough.

131
00:19:16,561 --> 00:19:18,461
ls this enough or
shall l get more?

132
00:19:18,596 --> 00:19:23,556
You gave me the whole lot.
Now what will you eat?

133
00:20:53,791 --> 00:20:57,352
Suman, Come.
lt's time to see off the bride.

134
00:21:52,417 --> 00:21:53,679
Yes.

135
00:21:56,154 --> 00:21:58,987
Where are you going?
l'll see to all that.

136
00:21:59,157 --> 00:22:01,318
Go and sit near the presents
and the dowry items.

137
00:22:01,426 --> 00:22:02,950
Okay.

138
00:22:11,235 --> 00:22:13,032
Yes?

139
00:22:13,571 --> 00:22:16,938
Where are you off to?
Come and take charge of her.

140
00:22:17,909 --> 00:22:22,937
She's drained out weeping.
And my feet are like lead!

141
00:22:23,147 --> 00:22:25,081
Go and sit her in the car.

142
00:22:39,564 --> 00:22:43,466
Son, l'm giving you
my flesh and blood.

143
00:22:43,601 --> 00:22:46,661
Please cherish her.
- Of course.

144
00:22:51,142 --> 00:22:52,700
Please don't cry, Aunty.

145
00:23:41,158 --> 00:23:44,787
Duryodhan, you are wanted
by Lal Bihariji.

146
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:58,538
Only that man has a right
to call me by my first name.

147
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:04,109
Not his servants. Get it?
Tell him l'll get ready and come.

148
00:24:21,198 --> 00:24:22,631
ls Suman at home?

149
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:25,667
Of course.
That's why you've come.

150
00:24:25,937 --> 00:24:30,306
Else, when l was alone, you
didn't even ask me how l was!

151
00:24:31,042 --> 00:24:35,741
Find some time for your
friend's brother too!

152
00:24:36,847 --> 00:24:40,977
Hey...
You didn't answer me.

153
00:24:41,485 --> 00:24:46,081
Only a tight slap will answer
your question.

154
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:51,489
But l don't want to hurt
my friend by insulting you!

155
00:25:00,871 --> 00:25:05,831
Well, our eyes met, and,
l lost my heart to him.

156
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:09,343
l don't even know if
we'll ever meet again.

157
00:25:11,248 --> 00:25:13,944
He had come at your
cousin's wedding.

158
00:25:16,854 --> 00:25:22,292
He was with the groom, so, he
must be from the groom's side.

159
00:25:22,526 --> 00:25:27,964
Even l know all that, stupid!
Tell me how do l meet him again.

160
00:25:28,299 --> 00:25:33,362
l'll tell you. Hold on.
Turn your heart into paper.

161
00:25:33,571 --> 00:25:37,405
Make pen of your love, and
with your tears as ink...

162
00:25:37,541 --> 00:25:41,841
write to your cousin,
that at her wedding...

163
00:25:41,979 --> 00:25:46,416
who was the hero with her hubBy.
From where had he come?

164
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:49,678
What's his name, and address.

Hello, you're running as though
you've found some treasure.

173
00:26:36,967 --> 00:26:38,935
Something like that.

00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:42,005
Nothing. ls Uma at home?

175
00:26:42,139 --> 00:26:45,040

Look! The sun is high, and
Her Majesty is still sleeping!

You're a fast one! You lost your
heart to someone at the wedding.

180
00:27:24,949 --> 00:27:27,816
And now you're flirting
with my brother?

181
00:27:27,985 --> 00:27:29,646
Brother?

182
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:34,320
Yes. He's my brother, Raju.
He has come after 1 5 years!

183
00:27:34,558 --> 00:27:39,860
He was studying at my uncle's.
He came at dawn, so he's sleeping.

184
00:27:40,097 --> 00:27:44,227
ls he that Raju?
- Not that Raju.

185
00:27:44,368 --> 00:27:46,768
He's this Raju!

186
00:28:33,384 --> 00:28:37,013

''l will kiss''

207
00:32:06,897 --> 00:32:15,362
''That whiCh l couldn't write,

208
00:32:16,106 --> 00:32:19,507
''l sigh in resignation...''

209
00:32:20,044 --> 00:32:24,071
''l am scared...''

210
00:32:24,281 --> 00:32:31,881
''and yet, l profess my love

''l write to my Beloved''

221
00:33:44,528 --> 00:33:47,827
l feel like hanging you in place
of this punching bag...

222
00:33:47,998 --> 00:33:53,368
and hammering punches!
- Look, l think you're mistaken.

223
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:58,940
No! l know everything.
You've come Back after 1 5 years.

224
00:33:59,143 --> 00:34:03,045
You've Been here a week, and,
you don't have time to meet me?

225
00:34:03,213 --> 00:34:07,741
l don't know how the week flew.
l just know this.

226
00:34:07,851 --> 00:34:12,481
That my friend who couldn't lift
his satchel is now a tough-guy!

227
00:34:12,756 --> 00:34:17,625
Who can make a hole in a wall
with one punch. What do you do?

228
00:34:21,198 --> 00:34:23,860
Break Bones!
- What!

229
00:34:24,768 --> 00:34:27,168
Come. l'll show you.

230
00:35:03,941 --> 00:35:07,377
- What are you staring for?
- Friend...

231
00:35:07,544 --> 00:35:12,140
You look like Arjun, But
your pride is like Duryodhan.

232
00:35:12,849 --> 00:35:16,979
You said you broke bones, but here,
you get yours broken?

233
00:35:17,287 --> 00:35:21,656
l get paid to Break bones,
and them, broken too.

234
00:35:21,925 --> 00:35:27,192
Get paid? Who pays you?
- The same who pays to break them.

235
00:35:29,399 --> 00:35:34,894
l see. So that means,
this Duryodhan of modern times...

236
00:35:35,072 --> 00:35:37,472
has a villainous uncle
behind him too!

237
00:35:47,217 --> 00:35:51,517
How many times do l tell you
not to do that? l sneeze.

238
00:36:04,434 --> 00:36:07,631
See this.
- Praise the Lord.

239
00:36:07,804 --> 00:36:09,601
And may my foe rot!

240
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:12,538
That he will.
- Then come. Let us embrace.

241
00:36:13,877 --> 00:36:18,280
That won't be of any use.
Our hearts will not meet.

242
00:36:18,482 --> 00:36:21,042
This damn paunch
comes in between!

243
00:36:24,087 --> 00:36:28,615
Your wit is really endearing.
Go and ask in the Gem-market.

244
00:36:28,692 --> 00:36:32,890
l'm always telling everyone,
how honest, righteous, nice...

245
00:36:35,565 --> 00:36:40,696
Don't aBuse me like this.
Let me make it clear.

246
00:36:40,871 --> 00:36:45,103
Never call me decent.
l'm the biggest bastard!

247
00:36:45,275 --> 00:36:48,711
Understand?
Now talk shop!

248
00:36:49,946 --> 00:36:56,078
Every week Kalia threatens and
increases the extortion money.

249
00:36:57,254 --> 00:36:59,916
Throw him in the gutter.

250
00:37:00,424 --> 00:37:05,521
Why do you talk softly? Am l
scared of anyone? Talk loudly!

251
00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:10,222
Only you can have him finished...

252
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,733
And for that, l'm willing
to pay you Rs.1 0,000/-.

253
00:37:16,506 --> 00:37:20,806
You're still at this stage? lf
you're not up to the competition...

254
00:37:21,011 --> 00:37:25,641
l'll dangle you here!
l won't spare you... Listen you guys.

255
00:37:25,782 --> 00:37:29,684
l spend a fortune for you.
And it's all hard-earned money.

256
00:37:29,853 --> 00:37:35,291
l sweat from here to here.
So! What were you saying, sir?

257
00:37:37,394 --> 00:37:42,923
To kill that Kaliya,
l'm willing to give you Rs. 20,000/-.

258
00:37:43,066 --> 00:37:47,833
Are you preparing him to kill
a man or a mosquito?

259
00:37:48,705 --> 00:37:54,735
Knock him down and defeat him!
What kind of training is this?

260
00:37:55,345 --> 00:37:59,406
TeaCh them well, else l'll lose
self-respect in the competition.

261
00:38:00,050 --> 00:38:01,984
Will you have me humiliated?

262
00:38:04,721 --> 00:38:07,053
What did you say, sir?
l didn't hear properly.

263
00:38:09,926 --> 00:38:11,757
Praise the Lord.

264
00:38:13,697 --> 00:38:16,461
For this job, the merchants
can pay even Rs.50,000/-.

265
00:38:22,706 --> 00:38:24,503
One lakh!

266
00:38:27,377 --> 00:38:29,902
One lakh in advance.
The other, after the job is done.

267
00:38:37,387 --> 00:38:39,321
Praise Lord Shiva.

268
00:38:52,135 --> 00:38:54,535
So fatso?
Looking at the sharp edge, eh?

269
00:38:55,439 --> 00:38:58,897
This isn't sharpened by
ruBbing it on a stone...

270
00:38:59,242 --> 00:39:04,043
But by disemBoweling
bastards like you.

271
00:39:06,049 --> 00:39:10,315
l made a mistake.
Please forgive me.

272
00:39:10,487 --> 00:39:14,048
Praise the Lord.
He himself committed a sin.

273
00:39:14,191 --> 00:39:18,924
And comes to your devotee,
O Lord, and seeks forgiveness.

274
00:39:19,062 --> 00:39:22,657
You hired that 'Ponytail' to kill
me! l'll cut off his ponytail...

275
00:39:22,799 --> 00:39:28,135
and use it as a broom!
But before that, l'll cut you!

276
00:39:29,739 --> 00:39:31,969
l was betrayed.
- l eat only the Holy offerings.

277
00:39:32,075 --> 00:39:33,372
Open the lid!

278
00:39:37,681 --> 00:39:41,378
See this gutter?
The mouth of this gutter...

279
00:39:41,451 --> 00:39:46,320
opens in my room. And even the
police don't know where it ends!

280
00:39:46,723 --> 00:39:52,218
l've thrown 99 dead men in this.
Today, it's your turn.

281
00:40:12,115 --> 00:40:18,953
The lap-dog of that Ponytail, eh?
l'll put you all in the gutter!

282
00:41:29,559 --> 00:41:31,925
Praise Lord Bajarang.

283
00:41:33,830 --> 00:41:38,233
Why are you Barking?
- He does that seeing stray-dogs!

284
00:41:38,501 --> 00:41:44,167
What stray-dogs?
l still wear your thread in my neck.

285
00:41:45,442 --> 00:41:47,740
l still look upon you
as my Master.

286
00:41:51,247 --> 00:41:57,083
Built yourself a nice house, l say.

287
00:41:58,955 --> 00:42:01,822
And trained your son
very well too!

288
00:42:07,330 --> 00:42:12,324
Why not? lt'll be burnished gold
that comes out of experience!

289
00:42:13,003 --> 00:42:18,066
Sincerity doesn't sound well in
the mouth of a jackal. Talk shop!

290
00:42:18,441 --> 00:42:21,899
l hear that you're entering
your son in the competition...

291
00:42:22,045 --> 00:42:25,742
against me?
- That's right.

292
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:30,914
lt's a very different 'kick'
to defeat a foe in his own den!

293
00:42:32,722 --> 00:42:37,887
What's the point in getting
at each other's throat?

294
00:42:38,728 --> 00:42:43,563
We bet on our wrestlers.
lf your son...

295
00:42:43,667 --> 00:42:48,832
joins my side,
l'll bet on him very heavily.

296
00:42:49,039 --> 00:42:51,735
Touts like you may be
greedy for money.

297
00:42:53,877 --> 00:42:58,678
Who lead astray innocent
wrestlers with greed of money.

298
00:42:58,882 --> 00:43:03,546
And fill your own coffers by
putting their lives at stake.

299
00:43:06,022 --> 00:43:09,788
These martial arts,
which is our ancient culture...

300
00:43:09,926 --> 00:43:16,525
has given fame to other countries.
But alas!

301
00:43:17,567 --> 00:43:21,936
This art is like an orphan
in its country of origin,...

302
00:43:22,105 --> 00:43:27,600
who's seeking its future!
l had toiled to my Bones...

303
00:43:27,777 --> 00:43:34,114
and erected a temple to this art.
To serve those who loved it.

304
00:43:35,185 --> 00:43:39,645
But you...
you robBed me of it...

305
00:43:39,856 --> 00:43:45,260
and hollowed it's very base!
And turned it into a gambling den!

306
00:43:47,130 --> 00:43:49,291
Fed up of your activities,...

307
00:43:50,233 --> 00:43:53,634
l trained my son
to fight against you.

308
00:43:54,771 --> 00:43:59,708
So that he'll bring justice, and
put an end to your crimes!

309
00:44:01,711 --> 00:44:06,341
Dreams seen with eyes
wide open don't come true.

310
00:44:07,016 --> 00:44:10,645
This dream will soon
become a reality.

311
00:44:11,154 --> 00:44:14,920
That day is not far when my son,
among a throng of thousands...

312
00:44:15,492 --> 00:44:19,326
will chop your wrestlers
like carrots and radishes!

313
00:44:19,729 --> 00:44:22,095
Then you better hear me out.

314
00:44:23,032 --> 00:44:27,230
lf your son competes against me,...

315
00:44:28,571 --> 00:44:33,702
then it'll be his first, and
final competition of his life!

316
00:45:13,316 --> 00:45:17,776
How lucky for me that you have
come. But why sit here?

317
00:45:17,921 --> 00:45:20,185
Come and sit there.
- No.

318
00:45:20,356 --> 00:45:22,187
lt's fun watching from near.

319
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:25,587
Exactly. Nearer the better!

320
00:45:25,962 --> 00:45:27,520
Please come.
- No thanks.

321
00:45:27,664 --> 00:45:30,690
l'll sit here.
- Hey you! Look after her.

322
00:45:30,834 --> 00:45:34,736
She's my personal special guest.
Trouble to her means trouble for you!

323
00:45:34,871 --> 00:45:37,135
Please sit down.
- Thank you.

324
00:45:43,146 --> 00:45:45,444
Dear nephew.
- Yes?

325
00:45:45,615 --> 00:45:48,778
Duryodhan's sister is quite a dish.

326
00:45:48,985 --> 00:45:53,319
True.
- How will she look as your aunt?

327
00:45:53,489 --> 00:45:54,683
Uncle...

328
00:45:54,858 --> 00:45:58,794
What about that other aunt?
- Spoilsport!

329
00:46:00,230 --> 00:46:02,960
- But of Course, unCle!
- l'm still a bachelor as yet.

330
00:47:35,458 --> 00:47:38,256
That's minus one wrestler, unCle!

331
00:49:14,490 --> 00:49:17,721
Not one, but two!

332
00:49:19,429 --> 00:49:21,363
Go on, nephew.
Reduce the rates.

333
00:50:41,911 --> 00:50:45,574
Go and raise the rate.
- Uncle...

334
00:50:45,748 --> 00:50:48,148
Do as l say.

335
00:50:48,251 --> 00:50:50,776
These were just jokers...
The real fighter will join in now.

336
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:01,526
He seems a real good fighter.
- My dear nephew...

337
00:51:01,664 --> 00:51:07,967
History will not repeat itself.
Duryodhan will win!

338
00:51:08,137 --> 00:51:10,196
Of course.
- Go raise the rates.

339
00:52:36,359 --> 00:52:42,059
Nephew dear, this bastard
will really humiliate me!

340
00:52:44,367 --> 00:52:49,361
Do one thing.
Take this pill.

341
00:52:49,605 --> 00:52:54,304
Go and give it.
lt will save our face. Go on.

342
00:52:59,815 --> 00:53:03,012
Uncle has sent this for you.

343
00:53:03,152 --> 00:53:07,680
Here you are.
But be smart about it. Okay?

344
00:53:13,496 --> 00:53:18,365
l've given him the life-saving pill.
- l don't!

345
00:53:18,534 --> 00:53:22,061
lt's not a life-saving pill
but a blinding-pill.

346
00:55:52,321 --> 00:55:58,556
Sir, l'm sorry, but your son
has fractured his vertebra.

347
00:56:23,919 --> 00:56:25,978
Praise Lord Bajarang.

348
00:56:28,591 --> 00:56:33,790
Your eyes still spit sparks
from the fire in your heart.

349
00:56:35,064 --> 00:56:38,090
But how can l be blamed
for whatever that happened?

350
00:56:38,267 --> 00:56:42,499
l had warned you before hand.
Anyway...

351
00:56:42,638 --> 00:56:48,304
Why rake up the past?
l've brought you a present.

352
00:56:48,444 --> 00:56:52,744
lf you accept it,
l'll consider myself very lucky.

353
00:56:59,788 --> 00:57:05,158
See this; you've already
got a wheel chair for your son.

354
00:57:05,294 --> 00:57:09,492
But l thought, your bones
must be deteriorated too.

355
00:57:09,665 --> 00:57:15,069
How long will you push your
son's chair? lt's imported.

356
00:57:15,170 --> 00:57:20,665
lt's automatic.
See this. lt has a remote too.

357
00:57:20,876 --> 00:57:25,540
Press this button and
make it run.

358
00:57:51,774 --> 00:57:57,007
Yours truly has sponsored
this program. Like it?

359
00:58:02,718 --> 00:58:06,745
This is my grasp, Behari.

360
00:58:37,152 --> 00:58:40,212
What is it? You're neither
drinking nor enjoying.

361
00:58:40,422 --> 00:58:42,686
lt's his Birthday.
- Really?

362
00:58:42,858 --> 00:58:45,122
lt's just a pretense
to woo the girl.

363
00:58:45,227 --> 00:58:46,319
ls she coming?

364
00:58:46,462 --> 00:58:51,661
Her brother is! As they say, bribe
the guard to get to the treasure!

365
00:58:53,268 --> 00:58:56,066
Quiet!
He has come.

366
00:59:15,057 --> 00:59:18,823
l don't drink.
- Come on, have something.

367
00:59:37,046 --> 00:59:41,483
Darling, it's dark now.
lf you wish...

368
00:59:41,617 --> 00:59:47,214
we three will escort you
to your destination.

369
00:59:48,857 --> 00:59:52,520
We're just small fries, darling.

370
00:59:52,728 --> 00:59:56,994
The big fish is following.

371
00:59:59,368 --> 01:00:01,302
Let her go!

372
01:00:01,470 --> 01:00:03,597
Please leave.

373
01:00:08,544 --> 01:00:11,809
ls she your sister or something?

374
01:00:14,383 --> 01:00:19,150
You dare touch him again.

375
01:00:20,723 --> 01:00:24,819
He's my girl's brother.

376
01:00:35,070 --> 01:00:39,871
What are you looking at?
- The stray dogs in our lane.

377
01:00:41,443 --> 01:00:46,471
Their number is increasing daily.
Drink this milk before sleeping.

378
01:00:48,650 --> 01:00:53,110
Yes?
- Do you know Duryodhan?

379
01:00:53,622 --> 01:00:56,386
Every kid in the area knows him.

380
01:00:56,725 --> 01:00:58,625
How is he?

381
01:00:58,727 --> 01:01:02,094
He's your friend.
You know him better.

382
01:01:02,564 --> 01:01:04,589
l want your opinion.

383
01:01:07,703 --> 01:01:09,534
Shall l tell you the truth?

384
01:01:15,077 --> 01:01:18,979
He's a lowly worm in a gutter!

385
01:01:27,523 --> 01:01:32,085
By revealing his true worth, you've
saved your brother from anger.

386
01:01:43,372 --> 01:01:49,004
Last night due to liquor
l spoke a lot of nonsense.

387
01:01:49,178 --> 01:01:51,305
Get lost!

388
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:54,574
l've come to apologize...

389
01:01:58,053 --> 01:01:59,782
Look Raju...

390
01:02:02,157 --> 01:02:09,290
l'm tolerating your impudence
because you are Uma's brother.

391
01:02:18,740 --> 01:02:24,269
lf you mention my sister again,
l'll bash you up at the crossroads.

392
01:02:31,587 --> 01:02:36,251
What are you staring at?
He's my childhood friend.

393
01:02:36,391 --> 01:02:39,758
We have our differences.
Now go. Go!

394
01:02:45,334 --> 01:02:49,703
l thought sincerity would work.

395
01:02:50,339 --> 01:02:55,140
But looks like l'm fated
for something worse!

396
01:02:55,644 --> 01:03:00,809
Leave me! Else l'll scream.
- Really? Go ahead.

397
01:03:25,274 --> 01:03:36,412
''My heart would find peace...''

398
01:03:36,618 --> 01:03:41,555
''if only you would smile''

399
01:03:41,890 --> 01:03:47,487
''lf only you would smile,
it'd usher in spring''

400
01:03:47,763 --> 01:03:58,970
''My heart would find peace...

401
01:03:59,074 --> 01:04:04,376
''if only you would smile...''

402
01:04:04,546 --> 01:04:09,984
''lf only you would smile,
it'd usher in spring''

403
01:04:10,118 --> 01:04:20,824
''My heart would find peace...''

404
01:04:39,448 --> 01:04:45,580
''Punish me as you will;
commit any atrocity''

405
01:04:45,754 --> 01:04:50,953
''But do not look away''

406
01:04:53,895 --> 01:04:59,629
''Punish me as you will;
commit any atrocity''

407
01:04:59,801 --> 01:05:05,171
''But do not look away''

408
01:05:05,507 --> 01:05:11,036
''My heart calls out to you''

409
01:05:11,380 --> 01:05:17,012
''l yearn to embrace you''

410
01:05:18,787 --> 01:05:24,521
''For my sake, my love...''

411
01:05:30,365 --> 01:05:36,235
''do take me into your arms''

412
01:05:36,538 --> 01:05:46,675
''lt'd add to my beauty...''

413
01:05:47,249 --> 01:05:53,017
''if only you would smile''

414
01:05:53,221 --> 01:05:59,023
''lf only you would smile,
it'd usher in the spring''

415
01:05:59,194 --> 01:06:08,899
''lt would give my
heart some peace...''

416
01:06:45,707 --> 01:06:51,771
''You don't know...''

417
01:06:51,980 --> 01:06:58,078
''what l'm going through,
my love''

418
01:06:59,754 --> 01:07:05,249
''You wouldn't know.....''

419
01:07:05,961 --> 01:07:10,989
''what l'm going through,
my love''

420
01:07:11,933 --> 01:07:22,571
''There are things more important
than falling in love''

421
01:07:25,247 --> 01:07:36,556
''To pine for you thus...''

422
01:07:36,758 --> 01:07:42,822
''what else am l to do,
so you would believe me?''

423
01:07:42,998 --> 01:07:53,704
''What am l to do to
make you believe me.....?''

424
01:07:53,975 --> 01:07:59,379
''lf only you would smile...''

425
01:07:59,548 --> 01:08:04,713
''it'd usher in
the spring''

426
01:08:05,020 --> 01:08:15,658
''lt would give my heart
some peace...''

427
01:08:20,902 --> 01:08:23,837
As long as you're in this room,
you'll remain alive.

428
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:29,101
lf you try to meet that rascal,
you'll cross the threshold alright.

429
01:08:29,311 --> 01:08:37,013
But without a soul in your body!
- You want to avenge your insult?

430
01:08:38,453 --> 01:08:40,421
Because Raju insulted you, and,
threw you out of his house?

431
01:08:41,022 --> 01:08:45,789
Because Uma rebuked you?
But that's what you're worth!

432
01:08:48,263 --> 01:08:51,664
Your each slap shall
strengthen my confidence.

433
01:08:52,801 --> 01:08:56,703
Because your oppression is not as
effective as Raju's love!

434
01:08:57,405 --> 01:09:02,206
Try to understand. l couldn't bear
him taking my sister's name.

435
01:09:03,078 --> 01:09:08,209
So how will he accept our love?
He'll be an iron wall between us!

436
01:09:08,984 --> 01:09:11,384
We'll melt that iron wall
with our love.

437
01:09:12,087 --> 01:09:16,046
And if we can't we'll bang our heads
on it, till we die!

438
01:09:16,691 --> 01:09:18,556
You're being emotional.

439
01:09:19,060 --> 01:09:22,655
You want to turn your back
on me, don't you? Then do so.

440
01:09:23,064 --> 01:09:27,660
But remember, at every turn
you take in your life...

441
01:09:27,869 --> 01:09:33,034
you'll find me!
Maybe you can stay without me.

442
01:09:33,241 --> 01:09:38,178
But l won't be able to.
Nor live without you.

443
01:09:39,514 --> 01:09:42,779
Yes, but l Can die!

444
01:10:08,843 --> 01:10:12,040
That hero hasn't been seen
for the past 4 days.

445
01:10:12,280 --> 01:10:16,774
Hero? You mean coward.
Must've got scared and run off!

446
01:10:17,018 --> 01:10:21,478
He may hide in his house.
- Where's your darling boy?

447
01:10:22,390 --> 01:10:27,327
ls he hiding in a hole or behind
you? Ask him to come out.

448
01:10:28,029 --> 01:10:32,523
Else ask him to wear bangles!
- lf not him, send your daughter.

449
01:10:32,967 --> 01:10:37,097
l'll put bangles on her
in front of everybody here!

450
01:10:38,673 --> 01:10:41,005
Where are you going?
- To spit on that cur!

451
01:10:41,109 --> 01:10:42,576
Are you mad?

452
01:10:42,744 --> 01:10:44,609
Let him bark.
- But Mom he...

453
01:10:44,779 --> 01:10:48,044
Whether mud falls on man
or he falls in the mud...

454
01:10:48,216 --> 01:10:51,674
it's the man who gets stained!

455
01:10:52,253 --> 01:10:54,414
lf we...

456
01:10:57,625 --> 01:11:01,584
She shut the window, Guru.
- Why shut the window?

457
01:11:02,030 --> 01:11:06,364
Didn't you like my proposal?
You'll be sorry...

458
01:11:06,968 --> 01:11:11,132
You won't find a better man
than me in this whole area!

459
01:11:38,733 --> 01:11:40,633
Stop him!

460
01:12:24,012 --> 01:12:30,315
''l have embraced you
and decided...''

461
01:12:30,452 --> 01:12:36,550
''l have embraced you
and decided...''

462
01:12:36,758 --> 01:12:41,923
''that we will live
and die together''

463
01:12:42,797 --> 01:12:48,030
''We're not going to be
afraid of the world''

464
01:12:48,603 --> 01:12:53,597
''We're not going to be
afraid of the world''

465
01:12:55,343 --> 01:13:01,077
''l have embraced you
and decided...''

466
01:13:01,349 --> 01:13:06,878
''l have embraced you
and decided...''

467
01:13:07,455 --> 01:13:13,519
''that we will live
and die together''

468
01:13:14,028 --> 01:13:18,522
''We're not going to be
afraid of the world anymore''

469
01:13:20,168 --> 01:13:24,901
''We're not going to be
afraid of the world anymore''

470
01:13:59,140 --> 01:14:05,943
''We will say this
before the world...''

471
01:14:06,180 --> 01:14:11,709
''We will not live apart
even for a moment''

472
01:14:14,923 --> 01:14:21,226
''We will say this
before the whole world''

473
01:14:21,429 --> 01:14:27,231
''We will not live apart
even for a moment''

474
01:14:27,569 --> 01:14:33,667
''We have promised each other;
we will not break those vows''

475
01:14:33,875 --> 01:14:38,778
''We will not aBandon eaCh other;
we're in love''

476
01:14:41,049 --> 01:14:45,145
''We will do as we please''

477
01:14:46,287 --> 01:14:51,782
''We're not going to be
afraid of this world anymore''

478
01:14:52,627 --> 01:14:57,326
''We're not going to be
afraid of this world anymore''

479
01:15:45,313 --> 01:15:51,377
''We're like the breeze;
you can't stop us''

480
01:15:51,619 --> 01:15:57,751
''Lovers we are; we will not
bow to atrocities''

481
01:16:00,995 --> 01:16:07,457
''We're like the breeze;
you can't stop us''

482
01:16:07,635 --> 01:16:13,540
''Lovers we are; we will not
bow to atrocities''

483
01:16:13,708 --> 01:16:19,704
''We will bear every sorrow
and pain''

484
01:16:19,914 --> 01:16:26,183
''We will even lay down
our lives for our love''

485
01:16:26,354 --> 01:16:32,224
''We are not going
to regret our love''

486
01:16:32,427 --> 01:16:38,195
''We're not going to be
afraid of this world anymore''

487
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:44,363
''We're not going to fear
the world anymore''

488
01:16:45,039 --> 01:16:49,772
''We're not going to be
afraid of anyone anymore''

489
01:17:06,661 --> 01:17:09,824
Didn't you give them
your blessings?

490
01:17:10,131 --> 01:17:12,190
l give him such a blessing...

491
01:17:14,435 --> 01:17:17,962
that it'll be a curse
not only to him, but...

492
01:17:18,172 --> 01:17:21,198
to his entire household!

493
01:17:23,878 --> 01:17:26,847
But first,
l'll find a nice boy for Suman...

494
01:17:27,081 --> 01:17:30,380
and get her married.
That's all.

495
01:17:31,652 --> 01:17:35,850
Are you long-sighted
by any chance?

496
01:17:36,190 --> 01:17:42,356
How about the one sitting opposite?
What's wrong with me?

497
01:17:42,597 --> 01:17:48,467
l've lost my heart
to Suman months ago.

498
01:17:49,604 --> 01:17:54,405
l love her!
You have no objection, do you...

499
01:17:54,675 --> 01:17:58,907
to be my brother-in-law?
- You want to make her a queen.

500
01:17:59,413 --> 01:18:02,143
And rather than she marry
that rascal...

501
01:18:02,350 --> 01:18:05,979
l'd prefer she become
your queen!

502
01:18:06,187 --> 01:18:11,022
She's my sweetheart.

503
01:18:12,894 --> 01:18:18,924
l'll make her the queen of my heart.
You'll marry me, won't you, dear?

504
01:18:20,134 --> 01:18:27,939
That day your slap hadn't
broken that thread called Rakhi.

505
01:18:28,209 --> 01:18:34,341
But today it broke. Because,
the one who dragged me here...

506
01:18:34,515 --> 01:18:39,646
isn't a brother, but a pimp, who
wants to sell his sister like a nasty ho!

507
01:18:43,057 --> 01:18:51,089
She means to say,
she's willing. Right, my dear?

508
01:18:52,166 --> 01:18:56,432
Yes. But before we're
tied in Holy matrimony...

509
01:18:56,904 --> 01:19:03,537
l want to tell you a fact.
Will you be able to swallow it?

510
01:19:03,845 --> 01:19:08,782
l eat the truth and swallow
the facts. Tell me the matter.

511
01:19:11,452 --> 01:19:15,183
l'm carrying Raju's love
in my womb.

512
01:19:16,858 --> 01:19:22,524
lf you can swallow this,
l'm ready to marry you!

513
01:19:26,234 --> 01:19:30,330
The bastard who has made you
a viCtim of his lust, l'll kill him!

514
01:19:31,272 --> 01:19:36,539
No! l lied to you. Raju is
innocent. He hasn't done anything

515
01:19:36,744 --> 01:19:41,044
He hasn't committed this sin.
Open the door! Please.

516
01:19:47,154 --> 01:19:51,648
Your wrath is showing that
you're out for Raju's blood!

517
01:19:52,894 --> 01:19:58,196
No, dear chap.
lt's so easy to kill him.

518
01:19:58,966 --> 01:20:03,562
He'll be free.
lt'll be fun to keep him alive.

519
01:20:04,305 --> 01:20:06,364
So that he yearns to die!

520
01:20:07,675 --> 01:20:13,978
lt's blood for blood.
And what about avenging honor.

521
01:20:15,549 --> 01:20:17,744
Understand?

522
01:20:20,922 --> 01:20:24,187
Let me go! Mother!
- Let her go...

523
01:20:27,929 --> 01:20:32,423
Help! Save me!

524
01:20:43,311 --> 01:20:46,371
Save me from him...
- Get up!

525
01:20:49,550 --> 01:20:51,882
Shut up!
- Let me go!

526
01:20:52,687 --> 01:20:53,449
Stop!

527
01:20:56,023 --> 01:21:02,189
Nobody shall leave.
He'll disrobe her in public.

528
01:21:02,797 --> 01:21:09,168
So that every citizen knows
what is meant by rape!

529
01:21:09,537 --> 01:21:13,769
Yes! And see how such an act
is avenged. Watch everyone.

530
01:21:17,311 --> 01:21:22,374
Let go of me!
Sir, l beg of you!

531
01:21:22,583 --> 01:21:26,747
She's like a daughter to you.
Please save her...

532
01:21:31,359 --> 01:21:35,819
No, brother.
l had lied to you.

533
01:21:36,097 --> 01:21:39,555
No! Let her go!

534
01:21:46,407 --> 01:21:51,367
Open this door!
- No, sir. Don't do this.

535
01:21:51,879 --> 01:21:55,838
You stupid woman.
He's not forcing himself on her.

536
01:22:05,059 --> 01:22:08,290
Someone help my daughter.

537
01:22:17,371 --> 01:22:25,073
You bloody son of a bitch!
Leave my sister alone.

538
01:22:41,595 --> 01:22:43,790
What's going on here?

539
01:22:46,267 --> 01:22:49,031
Come on, move!

540
01:22:49,270 --> 01:22:51,135
You, sir?

541
01:22:52,840 --> 01:22:56,139
lf you're here then it must be
some competition.

542
01:22:56,310 --> 01:22:59,575
This is a different sort
of a competition.

543
01:23:05,953 --> 01:23:10,913
Sir, save my daughter.
They're raping her. l beg you.

544
01:23:11,092 --> 01:23:15,586
He hasn't raped her yet, has he?
Come later and report.

545
01:23:17,115 --> 01:23:19,913
You bastard! Filthy, stinking dog!

546
01:23:20,018 --> 01:23:22,646
lf this had been your daughter,
would you have said this?

547
01:23:28,026 --> 01:23:32,759
String him up!
- Let me go, l say!

548
01:23:35,300 --> 01:23:40,932
You've a feud with me!
Let my sister go!

549
01:23:41,439 --> 01:23:44,636
Let her go, Brother.
Let go of her!

550
01:24:30,688 --> 01:24:33,179
You sinner!
Bloody rascal!

551
01:24:33,491 --> 01:24:35,356
l won't spare you!

552
01:24:37,462 --> 01:24:40,898
Take the girl with you!

553
01:24:41,633 --> 01:24:47,367
l'll have you hanged! People may
be scared of you, but l'm not!

554
01:25:14,165 --> 01:25:17,862
No, Uma, No!

555
01:25:18,069 --> 01:25:21,368
No! No!

556
01:25:57,375 --> 01:26:00,776
Bloody dog!
- Arrest him!

557
01:26:10,588 --> 01:26:13,455
You commit a murder and
then accuse a gentleman?

558
01:26:13,925 --> 01:26:20,592
You saw my sister being raped
and you ask for proof? Cur!

559
01:26:36,314 --> 01:26:38,214
Lock him up!

560
01:26:45,123 --> 01:26:49,389
Calls me a Cur, eh?
- Yes! You are a bloody dog!

561
01:26:49,560 --> 01:26:52,927
A tame dog who lives off
scraps thrown by that Behari!

562
01:26:54,599 --> 01:26:57,659
Flutter all you want
in the cage.

563
01:27:00,505 --> 01:27:04,441
Rave, as much as you like!
Go on...

564
01:27:05,376 --> 01:27:08,743
l let you off thinking
it was your last wish.

565
01:27:12,283 --> 01:27:18,051
Because l'll get you hanged
for the murder of your own sister.

566
01:27:21,225 --> 01:27:25,218
You'll go very far in life.
Very far!

567
01:27:27,131 --> 01:27:29,929
Take off this uniform
of a Police lnspector!

568
01:27:30,401 --> 01:27:33,302
And be a pimp to that Behari!
You'll mint money!

569
01:27:39,477 --> 01:27:44,540
And if you don't get anybody, ask
your Mom and sister to give him some lovin'!

570
01:27:46,951 --> 01:27:52,218
Hold your tongue, damn you!
Else l'll throttle you!

571
01:28:05,169 --> 01:28:10,163
You dare to spit, you Bastard!
That too on me?

572
01:28:10,408 --> 01:28:15,107
Pimps are meant to be spat at!
- Take him out!

573
01:28:30,161 --> 01:28:35,394
Why are you crossing your limits
and throwing your weight around?

574
01:28:35,633 --> 01:28:39,034
He's a Criminal, Sir.
He has murdered his sister.

575
01:28:39,337 --> 01:28:43,706
He's lying, and charging me falsely.
ln front of his very eyes...

576
01:28:43,841 --> 01:28:47,106
my innocent sister was raped
in public by Behari's orders.

577
01:28:48,746 --> 01:28:52,842
My mother put her head at his
feet and Begged...

578
01:28:53,017 --> 01:28:56,509
She asked for his help
as a keeper of the law.

579
01:28:56,687 --> 01:29:02,182
But instead, he watChed an innoCent
girl being raped mercilessly.

580
01:29:05,663 --> 01:29:09,827
l'm a different kind
of a police inspector!

581
01:29:11,335 --> 01:29:16,398
But he's lying, Sir.
- l'm capable of judging that!

582
01:29:16,974 --> 01:29:20,637
Because of people like you the
puBlic refers to the police...

583
01:29:20,845 --> 01:29:25,407
as pimps, eunuchs, and impotents!
Officers like you...

584
01:29:25,550 --> 01:29:29,145
have turned this House of
justice into a Bloody whorehouse!

585
01:29:30,354 --> 01:29:33,118
You auction the law
like old newspapers!

586
01:29:37,895 --> 01:29:41,695
How many more slaps will it take
to rouse your conscience?

587
01:29:42,900 --> 01:29:47,234
Threats from these tyrants
have made you so lifeless...

588
01:29:47,405 --> 01:29:51,569
that you can't hear the screams
and shouts of the victims!

589
01:29:52,710 --> 01:29:56,271
Have you all Become
mute and deaf?

590
01:29:58,216 --> 01:30:02,983
Don't forget your silence
is their strength.

591
01:30:03,387 --> 01:30:07,323
Those bastards have
raped Raju's sister.

592
01:30:07,658 --> 01:30:12,595
Tomorrow, those very men will do
the same to your women.

593
01:30:14,966 --> 01:30:21,235
lsn't there anyone among you who'll
make a statement against them?

594
01:30:23,708 --> 01:30:28,441
Shame on you cowards, who were
born from the womB of fear!

595
01:30:31,048 --> 01:30:34,074
Rouse your dead souls!

596
01:30:35,353 --> 01:30:37,253
Tell me!

597
01:30:46,497 --> 01:30:49,955
lf she goes to the police,
send her lover to Heaven!

598
01:31:12,990 --> 01:31:18,929
Praise the Lord, lnspector.
l welcome you, Sir.

599
01:31:19,130 --> 01:31:23,794
When l heard that you were coming,
l came as fast as l could.

600
01:31:23,935 --> 01:31:28,872
But what's all this?
- You've come for the first time...

601
01:31:29,040 --> 01:31:35,468
so why waste time in asking
what will you drink?

602
01:31:35,613 --> 01:31:38,810
l've cold and hot drinks here.
- You're very smart, sir.

603
01:31:38,983 --> 01:31:41,918
You've the things to shut
the mouth before it's opened!

604
01:31:42,086 --> 01:31:44,646
Honestly, Sir!

605
01:31:44,989 --> 01:31:47,822
l can't drink anything cold,
because l...

606
01:31:48,025 --> 01:31:51,756
And using the stick is my duty.
l won't have anything hot either.

607
01:31:54,999 --> 01:32:00,232
That'll make me hot tempered.
And temper is best avoided.

608
01:32:00,605 --> 01:32:03,904
l'm a different kind
of a Police lnspector.

609
01:32:04,141 --> 01:32:09,579
l'm no ordinary man either, sir.
- l had heard a lot aBout you.

610
01:32:10,114 --> 01:32:15,245
And today l've seen you too.
A nice shopping center this.

611
01:32:16,087 --> 01:32:19,079
Not a shopping center.
lt's a school.

612
01:32:19,323 --> 01:32:23,692
Here all the martial-arts
are taught to the students.

613
01:32:26,297 --> 01:32:31,291
Close this gambling den. You're
pulling wool over law's eyes...

614
01:32:31,502 --> 01:32:35,996
showing it as this.
- That's too muCh, Sir.

615
01:32:36,307 --> 01:32:41,643
A decent man is standing quietly
and you go on piling accusations?

616
01:32:42,013 --> 01:32:46,074
Any proof that this
is not a wrestling center?

617
01:32:46,350 --> 01:32:49,751
That it's not a school of martial
arts and that it's a gambling den?

618
01:32:49,887 --> 01:32:55,086
Look, if l put my mind to it,
l don't leave a stone unturned.

619
01:32:55,793 --> 01:32:59,229
And as for the proof,
l'll get that soon too!

620
01:33:17,581 --> 01:33:21,517
What are you doing? Keep it.
- Let me go.

621
01:33:21,719 --> 01:33:26,588
l want to burn myself with it.
- Have you gone mad?

622
01:33:26,691 --> 01:33:32,027
Yes, l have! The silence here
is eating up my insides.

623
01:33:32,196 --> 01:33:35,063
lt's swallowing me up!

624
01:33:37,234 --> 01:33:40,397
l'm responsible for Uma's death.

625
01:33:43,607 --> 01:33:46,337
No!
What nonsense is this?

626
01:33:52,416 --> 01:33:58,719
My pimp of a brother had
taken me to Be sold!

627
01:33:59,323 --> 01:34:03,225
To save my love for you,
l lied to him...

628
01:34:03,494 --> 01:34:06,930
that l was pregnant
with your child.

629
01:34:08,699 --> 01:34:13,159
That did it!
That small spark of a lie...

630
01:34:13,404 --> 01:34:16,771
became a funeral pyre for Uma.

631
01:34:19,310 --> 01:34:23,269
Hit me more. Strangle me!
l don't want to live.

632
01:34:56,480 --> 01:35:01,076
l won't spare you!
l'll kill you!

633
01:35:01,318 --> 01:35:05,152
Rascal! l won't spare you.
Let go of me, l say!

634
01:35:05,823 --> 01:35:09,987
You cur! l'll kill you!
Kill you! Let me go!

635
01:35:11,896 --> 01:35:17,357
To kill me, one needs
strong fists of iron.

636
01:36:01,545 --> 01:36:03,570
Throw this corpse
on the road!

637
01:37:04,174 --> 01:37:07,940
Doctor, why have you put...

638
01:37:09,346 --> 01:37:12,804
this white sheet
over my son's face?

639
01:37:13,117 --> 01:37:16,484
This white sheet has already
swallowed my daughter.

640
01:37:16,720 --> 01:37:19,985
Remove it! Take it off!
lt has...

641
01:37:44,915 --> 01:37:47,213
You can't go like this.

642
01:37:48,285 --> 01:37:52,881
This sheet can't give you salvation
without doing your duty. Hear me?

643
01:37:54,925 --> 01:37:59,385
Your blood can't become cold without
avenging your sister's death.

644
01:38:01,532 --> 01:38:08,597
l still haven't gotten over
your sister, Uma's death.

645
01:38:09,773 --> 01:38:15,040
So how can you go like this?

646
01:38:15,779 --> 01:38:20,182
No son. God can't do
such injustice to me.

647
01:38:20,517 --> 01:38:25,216
He can't snatch away
my flesh and Blood like this!

648
01:38:26,290 --> 01:38:30,954
Wake up son.
Get up!

649
01:38:31,228 --> 01:38:35,460
You've to avenge your sister's death.
Keep your promise to your mother.

650
01:38:35,699 --> 01:38:39,965
Get up son! Wake up!
Why don't you wake up?

651
01:38:44,375 --> 01:38:47,970
l'll never forgive you
if you don't get up... Never!

652
01:39:10,567 --> 01:39:15,630
Raju! My baby...

653
01:39:18,976 --> 01:39:21,536
Nurse! Arrange for glucose
and oxygen, fast!

654
01:39:26,383 --> 01:39:31,286
Welcome lnspector.
Why such a long face, Sir?

655
01:39:32,056 --> 01:39:35,719
Because your times are bad.
- What are you blaBbering?

656
01:39:36,060 --> 01:39:38,927
l'm not blabbering,
but foretelling the future.

657
01:39:39,163 --> 01:39:44,396
The butcher also tests the sharpness
of his knife before killing the goat.

658
01:39:44,568 --> 01:39:49,437
But you, you left your foe alive.
- Whom do you mean?

659
01:39:49,640 --> 01:39:53,406
Raju! He's still alive.
- No!

660
01:39:54,144 --> 01:39:57,978
A tiger's prey may escape
from the tiger's jaws.

661
01:39:58,148 --> 01:40:01,208
But my enemy cannot
escape from my hands!

662
01:40:03,520 --> 01:40:06,819
Had you strangled him
with such force...

663
01:40:06,990 --> 01:40:12,428
then he wouldn't have lived.
You people have invited death!

664
01:40:12,629 --> 01:40:18,727
The hospital is nearer for
Death, than my house!

665
01:40:18,936 --> 01:40:21,769
The new lnspector has already
landed in the hospital!

666
01:40:23,107 --> 01:40:26,736
lt was your good fortune that
Raju didn't make a statement.

667
01:40:27,044 --> 01:40:30,810
He just said he was involved
in an accident.

668
01:40:31,982 --> 01:40:36,783
This means that he has realized
how powerful we are!

669
01:40:37,755 --> 01:40:41,191
What you say is correct, But
its meaning differs slightly.

670
01:40:41,458 --> 01:40:42,823
Meaning?

671
01:40:42,993 --> 01:40:47,521
Meaning him changing his
statement is dangerous for you.

672
01:40:55,606 --> 01:40:59,303
Bless me mother, that l beCome
successful in my mission.

673
01:41:02,346 --> 01:41:07,249
You're turning your back
at me and going.

674
01:41:07,751 --> 01:41:13,986
But show me your face, only when
you cover those vermins in shroud!

675
01:41:31,875 --> 01:41:35,504
Take care of mom.
- lmpossiBle!

676
01:41:36,246 --> 01:41:42,185
You know very well that this art
has ruined my son's life.

677
01:41:42,586 --> 01:41:49,992
Now l don't want it to kill
some mother's child.

678
01:41:50,861 --> 01:41:53,591
That mother has already lost
her Child, sir.

679
01:41:54,031 --> 01:42:00,061
And this unfortunate brother has,
already been through jaws of death...

680
01:42:00,237 --> 01:42:02,535
to avenge his sister's death.
Sir...

681
01:42:02,706 --> 01:42:08,804
l've brought him to you,
hoping that if you bless him...

682
01:42:09,012 --> 01:42:11,242
then instead of
dying like a fool...

683
01:42:11,381 --> 01:42:14,976
he'll confront them
like a valiant man!

684
01:42:17,821 --> 01:42:20,949
Okay.
l'll train him.

685
01:42:22,926 --> 01:42:28,592
But on one condition.
Nobody is to visit him.

686
01:42:31,969 --> 01:42:37,669
Accepted. But surely a daughter
can come to meet a father.

687
01:42:39,910 --> 01:42:42,970
She may come, but sometimes.

688
01:43:10,841 --> 01:43:13,207
lt's nothing.
Come on...

689
01:43:17,247 --> 01:43:19,238
Good! Come on...
Well done!

690
01:44:22,546 --> 01:44:25,777
l can't do this!
lt's very painful.

691
01:44:25,916 --> 01:44:32,321
This pain is nothing compared
to the pain Behari forced on you!

692
01:44:34,257 --> 01:44:37,715
RememBer that pain,
your sister bore...

693
01:44:37,928 --> 01:44:41,295
when she was raped publicly.

694
01:44:43,633 --> 01:44:48,536
That pain which is still pricking
your mother's heart, like a thorn.

695
01:48:52,816 --> 01:48:56,274
Son, the lesson l'm going
to teach you today...

696
01:48:56,653 --> 01:48:59,986
is the final lesson
in this martial art, and...

697
01:49:00,123 --> 01:49:04,719
the last step in your training.
Just imagine...

698
01:49:04,928 --> 01:49:09,160
if you happen to lose
your eyesight due to a fight...

699
01:49:10,133 --> 01:49:17,767
you can still know your
foe from his foot falls.

700
01:49:17,941 --> 01:49:21,968
And the stroke of his weapon by the
way he cuts the wind's direction.

701
01:49:23,913 --> 01:49:28,612
Now l'm going to strike you.
Guess its direction.

702
01:49:34,057 --> 01:49:36,491
Try to guess. Concentrate.

703
01:49:38,595 --> 01:49:41,655
Save yourself.
Go on.

704
01:49:49,873 --> 01:49:54,367
What's the matter, son?
You're practicing for 1 5 days now.

705
01:49:54,978 --> 01:49:57,674
But why can't you get this?

706
01:49:57,881 --> 01:50:04,650
With your permission may l try
and teach this to Raju?

707
01:50:05,522 --> 01:50:13,190
You won't teaCh him, But make him
lose his concentration instead.

708
01:50:13,463 --> 01:50:16,489
Fire and wax cannot
remain together.

709
01:50:16,700 --> 01:50:20,830
My love is not wax.

710
01:50:21,104 --> 01:50:26,235
lt's that patience-cast iron
which no fire can melt.

711
01:50:29,813 --> 01:50:31,906
What the hell...

712
01:50:44,294 --> 01:50:48,856
Try and follow the sound
of this anklet.

713
01:50:49,666 --> 01:50:52,499
Where is it coming from?

714
01:53:19,549 --> 01:53:24,213
Why did you stop?
Come on, play with my body.

715
01:53:24,988 --> 01:53:28,355
Quench your physical thirst
which is billowing smokes of lust!

716
01:53:28,791 --> 01:53:32,420
Burn a woman's dignity, and
your own decency in its embers.

717
01:53:36,566 --> 01:53:39,501
Lead me astray from my aim!
- You were Being tested.

718
01:53:39,702 --> 01:53:44,469
This girl has shown her patience
by holding embers on her palm.

719
01:53:44,674 --> 01:53:51,307
You were to be tested, son.
And l'm happy you got through.

720
01:54:25,381 --> 01:54:28,509
Hello, darling.
You're so sexy, doll!

721
01:54:31,621 --> 01:54:37,059
Let me go, you rascal!
- You can't avoid me, baBy.

722
01:54:37,560 --> 01:54:40,154
Help! Help me somebody.

723
01:54:41,831 --> 01:54:47,497
Let me go!
- Help me somebody.

724
01:54:59,282 --> 01:55:01,546
Listen everybody.

725
01:55:05,288 --> 01:55:07,279
Look at this Bastard
very carefully.

726
01:55:09,959 --> 01:55:15,659
And recognize this goon of that
fiend. You all saw my sister's ruin.

727
01:55:18,101 --> 01:55:20,797
Now see the farce of his death.

728
01:55:52,402 --> 01:55:56,304
Uncle, why kill him?
He was one of us.

729
01:55:57,006 --> 01:56:01,841
This bastard killed Jiva.
They were always at loggerheads.

730
01:56:02,145 --> 01:56:07,242
Somebody else might have killed him.
- lmpossiBle.

731
01:56:07,684 --> 01:56:11,780
Because the style in which he
was killed is from our school.

732
01:56:12,088 --> 01:56:15,319
He knew this style well.

733
01:56:23,366 --> 01:56:27,132
Listen old hag, why are you
throwing that stuff all over?

734
01:56:27,336 --> 01:56:32,740
This is not mud.
lt's ashes from my Uma's pyre.

735
01:56:34,644 --> 01:56:40,344
And l'm scattering it here,
so that the sparks from her eyes...

736
01:56:40,516 --> 01:56:44,316
will raze this sinful
place to ashes!

737
01:56:50,193 --> 01:56:53,754
Laugh!
Laugh all you want.

738
01:56:54,130 --> 01:56:58,499
Because now your days
are numbered.

739
01:57:00,470 --> 01:57:06,067
You and every goon of yours
are going nearer to your death.

740
01:57:07,510 --> 01:57:10,035
Today, By killing
one of your men...

741
01:57:10,279 --> 01:57:14,181
my son has taken his
first step towards success.

742
01:57:17,053 --> 01:57:23,754
And by making such steps of
corpses, he get to your throat!

743
01:57:25,862 --> 01:57:30,026
That little boy...
He'll get to my throat?

744
01:57:30,533 --> 01:57:34,196
But he's sleeping in his cradle.
- This is where you're wrong.

745
01:57:35,571 --> 01:57:39,234
At this moment my son is growing up
in turmoil. And remember...

746
01:57:39,876 --> 01:57:45,508
One who's brought up in turmoil
changes the world!

747
01:57:51,120 --> 01:57:54,089
Now l get it!

748
01:57:56,359 --> 01:58:00,022
Our foe is being taken care
of by Baba Thakur.

749
01:58:02,632 --> 01:58:05,829
l didn't kill him,
so that he...

750
01:58:06,002 --> 01:58:09,665
will die a natural death
due to lifting his invalid son!

751
01:58:10,907 --> 01:58:13,432
But he still lives.

752
01:58:15,044 --> 01:58:17,342
He won't live long however.

753
01:58:37,400 --> 01:58:40,733
Well you no good gimp,
where's Raju?

754
01:58:41,704 --> 01:58:44,764
Which Raju?
- WhiCh, eh?

755
01:58:44,974 --> 01:58:46,908
You don't know him.

756
01:58:49,545 --> 01:58:54,915
He won't tell you easily.
So, let him sample our style.

757
01:59:45,935 --> 01:59:50,929
Behari's men had come
looking for you.

758
02:00:30,913 --> 02:00:33,473
Lift your hands and
show how you fight.

759
02:00:56,472 --> 02:01:00,238
RememBer this place?
By sister was raped here.

760
02:01:00,876 --> 02:01:04,607
And there, you people
had strung me up!

761
02:01:16,292 --> 02:01:20,558
l've strung you up today so
that curs like Behari can see...

762
02:01:20,796 --> 02:01:24,061
what happens to those who rape
somebody's sisters and daughters.

763
02:01:56,632 --> 02:02:03,561
What else is left now?
Ever since you've come here...

764
02:02:03,672 --> 02:02:08,803
we've had trouble! Now l know
why my sister died at childbirth.

765
02:02:10,046 --> 02:02:14,449
Come on in. Sit on my chest
and do a war-dance now!

766
02:02:14,650 --> 02:02:17,949
Did you find out where Raju is?
- No.

767
02:02:18,454 --> 02:02:22,413
ln which hole he's holed up,
l haven't come to know as yet.

768
02:02:22,792 --> 02:02:27,422
But yes. His mother stays with
that lady doctor, this l know.

769
02:02:27,830 --> 02:02:31,766
Nuts! Will l dance the
tango with her?

770
02:02:32,001 --> 02:02:34,128
Where is Raju?

771
02:05:55,537 --> 02:05:59,633
Where's that lnspector,
who makes noise aBout honesty...

772
02:05:59,808 --> 02:06:01,867
and makes life hell
for decent people like me.

773
02:06:03,979 --> 02:06:08,939
Behari, l think you're asking me
for myself!

774
02:06:09,151 --> 02:06:13,611
Look, l'm under a great tension.
My head's throbbing away.

775
02:06:15,124 --> 02:06:21,085
That chap has killed 3 wrestlers and
you're sitting... how do l say it...

776
02:06:21,263 --> 02:06:25,632
doing nothing?
- That's not true, Behari.

777
02:06:25,868 --> 02:06:30,328
We're doing our investigation.
Looking for some proof.

778
02:06:30,939 --> 02:06:35,376
Do one thing. Write a complaint.
- Great lnspector! Too good.

779
02:06:36,512 --> 02:06:40,949
Giving governmental advice!
l keep on writing complaints...

780
02:06:41,150 --> 02:06:45,610
while he goes around breaking
my wrestlers like some crockery.

781
02:06:45,854 --> 02:06:48,550
l'm beginning to understand
your shrewdness, sir.

782
02:06:53,929 --> 02:06:58,764
You understand the law
very well, sir.

783
02:06:59,802 --> 02:07:05,069
ln law, nothing is
considered without proof.

784
02:07:05,507 --> 02:07:11,377
Else, by now, l'd have defeated
many a wrestler.

785
02:07:12,181 --> 02:07:16,743
You do understand, don't you?
- Sure.

786
02:07:16,919 --> 02:07:18,944
But by the time you understand...

787
02:07:19,121 --> 02:07:22,955
And that slip of a boy
will do a war-dance on me!

788
02:07:26,995 --> 02:07:29,020
Why?

789
02:07:29,531 --> 02:07:33,262
Stupid aren't you?
Only he can tell you that.

790
02:07:33,402 --> 02:07:38,362
l want to know from you.
Why is he killing your men?

791
02:07:38,540 --> 02:07:41,566
Why does he make a ladder
of corpses to reach you?

792
02:07:42,978 --> 02:07:45,503
You are picking
an enmity with me!

793
02:07:48,016 --> 02:07:53,010
l told you. l know nothing.
- You know alright.

794
02:07:53,322 --> 02:07:58,658
And people in that colony know it.
Whose tongues are locked by threats...

795
02:07:58,861 --> 02:08:01,455
and feet are shackled
with cowardice!

796
02:08:02,631 --> 02:08:07,432
The fact is, Raju's sister
was raped on your orders!

797
02:08:09,104 --> 02:08:15,270
Don't blabber, lnspector.
You don't know my reach!

798
02:08:15,477 --> 02:08:19,470
My reach is right to the top!
- You mean God?

799
02:08:19,748 --> 02:08:23,809
Then it's fine, for l fear
nobody except God.

800
02:08:25,053 --> 02:08:30,650
And if you threaten me again
with your 'reach' l'll lock you up.

801
02:08:30,926 --> 02:08:35,829
And without proof! Because l'm
a different sort of an lnspector.

802
02:08:36,064 --> 02:08:38,965
Now get going!

803
02:08:49,311 --> 02:08:55,443
A little while from now,
we'll go our different ways.

804
02:08:57,186 --> 02:09:01,418
When our destination is the same,
how can our paths be different.

805
02:09:04,927 --> 02:09:11,127
You forget my destination
is only the hangman's noose!

806
02:09:12,334 --> 02:09:14,825
Then that noose will not be
around your neck alone...

807
02:09:15,003 --> 02:09:20,737
but around mine too!
l'll share your sentence.

808
02:09:22,611 --> 02:09:26,945
People share their joys.
You'll share sorrow?

809
02:09:27,749 --> 02:09:31,480
Raju, whatever is yours, is mine.

810
02:09:32,654 --> 02:09:34,986
l can't live a moment
away from you.

811
02:09:36,024 --> 02:09:37,992
Can you?

812
02:10:10,025 --> 02:10:19,593
''People live years
in separation.....''

813
02:10:20,269 --> 02:10:23,136
''as for us...''

814
02:10:23,305 --> 02:10:25,796
''such is our state...''

02:10:30,045 --> 02:10:40,182
''that even for a moment,
we can't live apart''

816
02:10:41,490 --> 02:10:46,223
''We can't live apart
even for a moment''

817
02:10:51,166 --> 02:11:00,632
''There are people who
spend years in separation...''

818
02:11:01,109 --> 02:11:04,044
''as for us...''

819
02:11:04,346 --> 02:11:11,115
''such is our state...''

820
02:11:11,320 --> 02:11:26,190
''that even for a moment,
we can't live apart''

821
02:11:52,160 --> 02:11:56,529

''ln love, we live and die''

823
02:12:07,342 --> 02:12:12,575
''We're crazy; we've in love''

''ln love, we live and die''

825
02:12:17,519 --> 02:12:22,479
''Such are things now,
my love...''

826
02:12:23,458 --> 02:12:27,588
''that l find life too short
to fulfill my love''

827
02:12:27,863 --> 02:12:32,732
''l find life too short
to fulfill my love''

828
02:12:33,068 --> 02:12:42,340
''Tears they shed in separation;
they spend years in separation.....''

829
02:12:42,744 --> 02:12:50,617
''But such is our state...''

830
02:12:52,721 --> 02:13:04,098
''not a moment can we spend
away from each other''

831
02:13:04,299 --> 02:13:08,201
''Not a moment can we
live apart''

832
02:13:38,600 --> 02:13:48,339
''We shall forget the world
and immerse ourselves in our love''

833
02:13:53,515 --> 02:14:02,890
''We shall forget the world and
immerse ourselves in love''

834
02:14:04,092 --> 02:14:07,084
''ln happiness and sorrow...''

835
02:14:08,063 --> 02:14:13,262
''we have found a new
name for our relationship''

836
02:14:19,374 --> 02:14:29,147
''They bear wounds on their heart;
they spend years in separation.....''

837
02:14:29,384 --> 02:14:34,481
''But such is our condition...''

838
02:14:38,894 --> 02:14:47,302
''not a moment can we live apart''

839
02:14:49,638 --> 02:14:54,007
''Not a moment, nor a day...
can we live away from each other''

840
02:14:54,576 --> 02:14:59,980
''Not a moment, not a day...''

841
02:15:00,182 --> 02:15:03,845
''can we live apart''

842
02:15:04,085 --> 02:15:09,045
''Live apart, we cannot''

843
02:15:31,446 --> 02:15:34,779
What are the police doing here?
- For your safety.

844
02:15:36,918 --> 02:15:40,319
One by one, your colleagues
are being sent to their death.

845
02:15:40,555 --> 02:15:43,991
The lnspector has deployed
his men for your safety.

846
02:15:44,593 --> 02:15:48,427
So that the killer will try and
come here and get caught.

847
02:15:48,697 --> 02:15:52,599
But we'll be like jail-birds!
Won't Be able to go out even!

848
02:15:52,868 --> 02:15:56,065
Why do you need to go out?
l'm here to do it for you.

849
02:15:59,741 --> 02:16:01,732
Don't worry.

850
02:16:11,920 --> 02:16:15,856
Stop the car! They're stuck
to me like an underwear!

851
02:16:22,631 --> 02:16:27,466
Hello, Sir.
- Well lnspector, what's all this?

852
02:16:27,669 --> 02:16:30,229
Are you coming behind me,
or following me?

853
02:16:30,372 --> 02:16:33,603
Neither of the two.

854
02:16:33,842 --> 02:16:38,609
This is for your safety.
- What do you mean?

855
02:16:38,847 --> 02:16:44,717
The lnspector has ordered us not
to leave you alone. You're in peril.

856
02:16:48,089 --> 02:16:51,217
Let's go.
The cat has crossed our path!

857
02:17:16,351 --> 02:17:20,447
lnspector! What is all this?
ls my bungalow a bag of sugar...

858
02:17:20,655 --> 02:17:23,852
for your khaki uniformed ants
to surround it?

859
02:17:24,092 --> 02:17:31,464
They're not ants. They're pillars
who are holding up your life.

860
02:17:31,800 --> 02:17:34,564
Else, death would've showed
itself here by now!

861
02:17:35,870 --> 02:17:38,703
Meaning?
- Behari, sir...

862
02:17:38,907 --> 02:17:43,207
After listening to you
at the police station...

863
02:17:43,411 --> 02:17:48,713
l realized, after giving it a
deep thought. That you're right.

864
02:17:49,951 --> 02:17:54,320
Actually Raju's wrong. The death
of his sister's has made him mad.

865
02:17:55,957 --> 02:18:02,089
And he can come here anytime.
- Then are you standing and...

866
02:18:02,263 --> 02:18:06,495
sunning your uniform?
Go on. Catch the culprit!

867
02:18:06,735 --> 02:18:12,605
That's why we've laid this trap.
To catch the culprit.

868
02:18:12,774 --> 02:18:17,370
But don't force it on me!
There are guards at my school.

869
02:18:17,579 --> 02:18:22,482
There are guards here!
How will my students take it?

870
02:18:22,650 --> 02:18:24,675
What aBout their competition?

871
02:18:27,055 --> 02:18:31,116
We're all goats in the eyes
of a butcher!

872
02:18:31,292 --> 02:18:36,662
Competition means an exam like
the one they hold in school.

873
02:18:38,166 --> 02:18:43,433
l also keep bouts among my
students in this martial art.

874
02:18:43,738 --> 02:18:49,370
And the winner gets certified,
and thrown into the world! Get it?

875
02:18:54,115 --> 02:18:57,573
lt's real fun drinking liquor
in the swimming pool.

876
02:19:04,893 --> 02:19:11,355
What luck! Beautiful girls
used to bathe here once!

877
02:19:11,566 --> 02:19:15,525
Now, this ox
is playing in the water!

878
02:19:24,379 --> 02:19:27,348
Uncle! Your phone.

879
02:19:28,583 --> 02:19:31,814
Now l'm fit
only to take phones!

880
02:20:14,429 --> 02:20:19,230
Where's the ox, l say.
Has he Become a fish.

881
02:20:42,557 --> 02:20:46,857
Knowing there were police there,
why did you take a risk?

882
02:20:48,463 --> 02:20:53,457
What if something happens to you?
- lt won't. And if it does, so be it.

883
02:20:54,969 --> 02:20:58,928
l've still to catch those 2 swines!
Don't know...

884
02:20:59,073 --> 02:21:02,702
how to get those 2 snakes
out of their holes!

885
02:21:03,144 --> 02:21:06,443
l've a solution to that too, son.

886
02:21:07,982 --> 02:21:12,351
l've got that instrument,
let alone its sound...

887
02:21:12,554 --> 02:21:16,718
its very appearance will force
them to leave their holes!

888
02:21:32,774 --> 02:21:37,711
May l ask who gave you
permission to declare this fight?

889
02:21:38,546 --> 02:21:42,346
These posters adorn
all the walls in the city.

890
02:21:43,618 --> 02:21:49,215
You don't look so foolish
as you try to appear.

891
02:21:49,824 --> 02:21:54,124
l'm 24 hours
under your surveillance.

892
02:21:54,395 --> 02:22:00,595
How can get these posters printed?
How can he enter the competition.

893
02:22:00,768 --> 02:22:05,228
He's not one of my students.
This is Raju.

894
02:22:13,314 --> 02:22:18,843
l'm a different kind of an officer.
Do one thing, Sir...

895
02:22:19,020 --> 02:22:23,047
Start preparations
for the competition.

896
02:22:23,258 --> 02:22:28,389
There can't be a better place
than your school to arrest Raju.

897
02:22:29,063 --> 02:22:32,089
Put it down!
- What is it?

898
02:22:32,267 --> 02:22:34,792
Shameless! You're drinking liquor...

899
02:22:34,936 --> 02:22:37,769
and there, he drinks my blood
you play politics, eh?

900
02:22:41,009 --> 02:22:46,709
l'm from Bihar. There a kid learns
politics in its mother's womb.

901
02:22:46,948 --> 02:22:51,942
l'll hit him so badly, that
your lnspector will forget himself!

902
02:22:52,086 --> 02:22:56,147
l don't follow.
- Don't you have any sense?

903
02:22:57,759 --> 02:23:02,355
Take this.
And listen very carefully.

904
02:23:02,497 --> 02:23:07,696
Didn't you say Raju's mother
was with the doctor? Kidnap her!

905
02:23:07,902 --> 02:23:12,202
And her son... Send him to hell
before he reaches the school.

906
02:23:12,440 --> 02:23:16,604
His mother has scattered ashes.
At her feet, l'll...

907
02:23:16,778 --> 02:23:20,373
offer her son's dead body!

908
02:23:35,997 --> 02:23:41,333
Good that the hunter and the hunted
met face to face. Much easier.

909
02:23:41,502 --> 02:23:45,438
l haven't come to make your job
easy, but to end it!

910
02:23:45,973 --> 02:23:52,606
l know that Behari's pet dog,
would be on my scent. So l came.

911
02:24:07,862 --> 02:24:10,057
Now even the bullets are over.

912
02:24:25,046 --> 02:24:29,483
Good you removed this belt.
Now l can easily hit you!

913
02:25:28,509 --> 02:25:32,206
Hey... lock me up.
Put a lock on this.

914
02:26:33,074 --> 02:26:37,511
Save my daughter, sir.
They're raping her! l beg you.

915
02:26:37,712 --> 02:26:42,945
She hasn't been raped yet.
When she is, come and report.

916
02:26:59,934 --> 02:27:05,133
You're so scared of death?
Can't recognize your own gun?

917
02:27:34,735 --> 02:27:41,038
Please keep quiet.
l can understand your impatience.

918
02:27:42,143 --> 02:27:46,011
But the wrestler, who has
put up posters all over...

919
02:27:46,280 --> 02:27:51,115
and declared that only
Duryodhan will bash him...

920
02:27:51,319 --> 02:27:58,191
break his bones, doesn't show up
himself, how Can we have a bout?

921
02:27:58,426 --> 02:28:02,260
There are only 1 0 minutes
for the Bout to begin.

922
02:28:02,630 --> 02:28:06,225
lf he doesn't show up till then,
there'll be no fight.

923
02:28:07,435 --> 02:28:12,168
This bout will be held.
Most definitely too!

924
02:28:12,373 --> 02:28:16,673
One moment of a storm
is enough to ruin!

925
02:28:16,844 --> 02:28:22,214
For the ruin of this marketplace,
we still have 10 minutes left.

926
02:28:22,416 --> 02:28:27,080
Don't worry.
The storm must be on its way.

927
02:29:08,396 --> 02:29:11,627
Just one minute left now...

928
02:29:11,832 --> 02:29:16,064
for Baba Thakur's claim...

929
02:29:16,303 --> 02:29:21,866
that the storm will definitely
come. The storm hasn't come.

930
02:29:22,009 --> 02:29:26,469
But Baba Thakur's face is sure
wet with sweat!

931
02:29:26,647 --> 02:29:29,810
Raju is not here and
will never be here.

932
02:29:29,984 --> 02:29:33,511
That's why without playing
a fight, l declare. Duryodhan,...

933
02:29:33,688 --> 02:29:36,657
Wait!

934
02:29:39,360 --> 02:29:44,525
There's a minute for the game
to start. Not finish.

935
02:29:44,799 --> 02:29:50,396
This fight shall end with
the lives of you bastards!

936
02:29:51,405 --> 02:29:53,737
Not before.

937
02:29:54,709 --> 02:29:58,873
Son, who did this to you?

938
02:29:59,246 --> 02:30:01,874
Those who feel threatened By me...

939
02:30:02,116 --> 02:30:07,110
Only they can do this to me.
- But Raju...

940
02:30:07,354 --> 02:30:12,223
you're very badly wounded.
- These wounds are nothing.

941
02:30:12,426 --> 02:30:19,025
Even if l was in my death throes,
l'd have still fought this bout.

942
02:30:20,401 --> 02:30:26,806
lf l don't fight today, then how
will my wounds be healed...

943
02:30:28,242 --> 02:30:32,474
which are on my heart?

944
02:30:41,922 --> 02:30:44,755
Nobody moves!

945
02:30:49,430 --> 02:30:55,335
On what charge, lnspector?
- He has killed lnspector Katre.

946
02:30:57,705 --> 02:31:03,166
He's a killer. Have you come
here after committing a murder?

947
02:31:03,844 --> 02:31:08,076
lnspector, arrest him!
What's he doing here?

948
02:31:08,349 --> 02:31:12,513
Sir, l won't stop you
from arresting Raju...

949
02:31:12,686 --> 02:31:19,023
But give us just half an hour.
l promise to hand him over to you.

950
02:31:19,193 --> 02:31:21,889
The law doesn't permit me
to do this.

951
02:31:22,029 --> 02:31:24,623
Try to understand.

952
02:31:24,765 --> 02:31:27,165
Just 1 /2 hour.
- This can't Be.

953
02:31:27,301 --> 02:31:30,862
Why not?
- Sir, you...

954
02:31:32,973 --> 02:31:38,536
lt can be possiBle.
Thakur is right.

955
02:31:38,712 --> 02:31:41,180
30 minutes won't change much.

956
02:31:41,482 --> 02:31:48,581
Yes, but this market place will!
Even the court allows a last wish.

957
02:31:48,889 --> 02:31:52,655
Surely, we can also do it
as keepers of the law?

958
02:31:52,860 --> 02:31:56,193
l'm a different kind
of an lnspector.

959
02:32:35,269 --> 02:32:41,139
By putting up posters all over
you've challenged death, not me!

960
02:33:47,041 --> 02:33:51,410
Your heart is in our custody!

961
02:33:55,082 --> 02:33:57,676
Understand?

962
02:35:33,814 --> 02:35:38,148
There's not a single trick
l've not taught you.

963
02:35:38,352 --> 02:35:43,619
Then why this? When that man
lays his hands on you...

964
02:35:43,857 --> 02:35:46,621
my heart dies a little.

965
02:35:47,461 --> 02:35:52,023
Mother!
- What?

966
02:36:04,378 --> 02:36:06,778
Come.

967
02:36:10,284 --> 02:36:20,285
Come, kid.
l'll show you what is Karate.

968
02:36:21,361 --> 02:36:26,128
Look at the champion!

969
02:37:39,072 --> 02:37:44,305
You dare, Thakur!
lf you try to untie them...

970
02:37:44,578 --> 02:37:49,208
l'll open fire.
You won't walk out alive now.

971
02:37:49,550 --> 02:37:53,008
l'll severe your head and present it
to my uncle on a salvar!

972
02:37:55,455 --> 02:37:58,549
He'll be so happy!

973
02:40:49,262 --> 02:40:52,527
This market is closed now!

974
02:46:43,450 --> 02:46:45,748
l'm a different kind
of an lnspector!

975
02:47:23,156 --> 02:47:26,284
Reap as you sow!

976
02:47:45,445 --> 02:47:47,675
You bastard!

977
02:47:50,383 --> 02:47:52,977
l'm going to kill you!

978
02:48:06,232 --> 02:48:09,668
Suman, my dear.
What have you done?

979
02:48:33,960 --> 02:48:36,053
Why did you do this?

980
02:48:36,262 --> 02:48:40,824
We've vowed to be together.
How could l break that vow?

981
02:48:42,202 --> 02:48:47,105
l've found a way to get to
the hangman's noose with you.

982
02:48:48,508 --> 02:48:53,468
We couldn't live together.
Let's at least die together.

983
02:48:58,251 --> 02:49:00,913
From all the statements
and proofs presented...

984
02:49:01,521 --> 02:49:06,481
this court sentences Raju
to death and...

985
02:49:06,659 --> 02:49:10,823
Miss Suman for
life imprisonment.

986
02:49:11,030 --> 02:49:15,399
Why? Why a death sentence to
him and life sentence to me?

987
02:49:15,568 --> 02:49:20,972
ln the eyes of law, one murder
is as bad as 1 0 murders.

988
02:49:21,174 --> 02:49:24,575
Then why this injustice to me?

989
02:49:24,744 --> 02:49:28,976
Our constitution doesn't allow
women to be hanged.

990
02:49:29,482 --> 02:49:33,714
Then change the law.
On one hand we talk of equality...

991
02:49:33,953 --> 02:49:38,617
and on the other, we always
present a woman as a weakling.

992
02:49:40,860 --> 02:49:46,662
Mr. President, l haven't Come
to request you to pardon me.

993
02:49:47,533 --> 02:49:53,802
But to seek Justice.
Our crime is same.

994
02:49:54,107 --> 02:49:59,340
Our sentences should Be same too.
Whether life-imprisonment...

995
02:49:59,612 --> 02:50:03,173
or a death sentence!

996
02:50:03,416 --> 02:50:07,113
Because you got rid of bad
element from the society...

997
02:50:07,320 --> 02:50:12,121
l reprieve your sentences.
