1
00:00:49,082 --> 00:00:51,243
O countrymen...

2
00:00:51,618 --> 00:00:53,415
do not ever sell your nation

3
00:00:53,987 --> 00:00:58,788
Do not sell this land;
do not sell its skies

4
00:00:59,426 --> 00:01:03,954
Martyrs have laid down
their lives for the country

5
00:01:04,464 --> 00:01:09,231
Do not heap disgrace
on their shrouds

6
00:01:14,341 --> 00:01:21,770
We lay down our lives,
O friends...

7
00:01:22,315 --> 00:01:26,979
so that our lndia
continues to live on

8
00:01:28,388 --> 00:01:35,453
We lived, we died,
for this nation...

9
00:01:35,862 --> 00:01:41,095
for this paradise...
so that it may forever blossom

10
00:01:41,501 --> 00:01:43,196
O friends...

11
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:11,792
Treat friends
like friends

12
00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:17,064
Treat your enemies,
as you ought to treat enemies

13
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:22,565
What is the life
of a coward?

14
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:27,910
The nation exhorts you; it's land
and it's skies appeal to you

15
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:35,381
To the country,
dedicate your youth

16
00:02:36,589 --> 00:02:40,616
Dedicate your lives
to the nation

17
00:02:41,928 --> 00:02:46,194
We have made so many legends...

18
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:51,529
it's upto you to write
the rest of the golden chapters

19
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:58,576
Long live, Mother lndia!

20
00:03:11,424 --> 00:03:15,451
Bad news, Wasimbhai. lndia has
won the war in Kargil.

21
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:24,068
No... we won't let lndia off
so easily.

22
00:03:25,071 --> 00:03:27,039
Against the arrogant lndians...

23
00:03:27,974 --> 00:03:30,670
we will continue our holy war.

24
00:03:31,111 --> 00:03:33,011
Long live, Mother lndia!

25
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,380
Long live, Mother lndia!

26
00:03:40,487 --> 00:03:44,924
To you Motherland,
we salute

27
00:03:57,037 --> 00:04:00,598
Long live the holy war!

28
00:04:05,278 --> 00:04:08,247
We have been defeated
by lndia so many times.

29
00:04:08,715 --> 00:04:11,707
That's because we have engaged
in the war head on.

30
00:04:12,118 --> 00:04:15,087
We can't defeat lndia in a war.

31
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,923
We must find a new way.

32
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:25,420
We have till now dealt
many body blows on lndia.

33
00:04:25,665 --> 00:04:29,066
We will now attack its
heart and it's soul.

34
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:33,097
We will pull out the brains
of those who think for lndia.

35
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:37,476
We will pluck out the eyes of those
who have dreams for lndia.

36
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:41,241
We will cut the tongues of those
who speak up for lndia.

37
00:04:41,815 --> 00:04:43,646
l declare today...

38
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:49,249
we will wipe out lndia from the
face of the earth very soon.

39
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:51,279
God Willing!

40
00:05:16,082 --> 00:05:18,312
lnterpol has placed
a reward on his head.

41
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:22,983
He had a hand in all the riots
and bomb blasts...

42
00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:25,985
that took place in the country
for the last many years.

43
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,988
He was the mastermind
behind the hijacking...

44
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:32,489
of the lndian Airlines aircraft
VTED W300.

45
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:35,796
As per our information,
he is now in Maharashtra.

46
00:05:43,776 --> 00:05:46,836
We must arrest Wasim Khan immediately.
At any cost.

47
00:05:51,151 --> 00:05:55,520
He has the backing of many
influential people in our country.

48
00:05:55,922 --> 00:05:59,756
They're his guardians. And that might
cause some problems and pressure.

49
00:06:04,063 --> 00:06:07,965
lf Wasim Khan is really
in Maharashtra, rest assured...

50
00:06:09,802 --> 00:06:11,667
He will soon be in our custody.

51
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:34,685
The police have got to know
that you're in Maharashtra.

52
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:37,528
So l've made arrangements
for a safe escape.

53
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:39,832
Hurry up. We have very little time.

54
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:47,571
Shocked, aren't you?
He's not Wasim Khan.

55
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:49,807
He's Allah Baksh. My look-alike.

56
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:56,875
lt isn'tjust easy for me to send
the cops on a wild goose chase.

57
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:00,045
l could very well make them
dance on my little finger.

58
00:11:21,647 --> 00:11:24,411
Yes sir. You'll be sent out of lndia
on a speedboat very soon.

59
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:06,155
The News.

60
00:12:06,592 --> 00:12:10,528
The dreaded terrorist Wasim Khan,
being hunted all over the world...

61
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:15,026
was arrested in Mumbai today.
The daring feat was achieved...

62
00:12:15,434 --> 00:12:19,029
by deputy Commissioner of Police,
Rajshekhar Azad.

63
00:12:19,438 --> 00:12:23,534
Without caring for his life,
he gave a long chase to Wasim Khan...

64
00:12:23,976 --> 00:12:25,876
and eventually arrested him.

65
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:30,207
The Chief Minister of Maharashtra
praised Mr Azad and said...

66
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:34,814
it was a matter of pride that
officers like him were in the state.

67
00:12:35,221 --> 00:12:38,418
Many senior officers
congratulated Mr Azad.

68
00:12:49,201 --> 00:12:52,398
Surprising.
The school hasn't yet shut down.

69
00:12:54,206 --> 00:12:56,640
Kids, where is your mummy?

70
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:11,446
l'm dead. Your Mummy...

71
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:15,524
lt's 12 o'clock! She's waiting
for me at the Jewelry Shop.

72
00:13:16,596 --> 00:13:20,532
Papa, you're in deep trouble.

73
00:13:29,709 --> 00:13:33,042
Sir, who is this lady
that you're scared of?

74
00:13:33,446 --> 00:13:38,110
l am nothing. The one Bombay
is scared of, is scared of her.

75
00:13:38,517 --> 00:13:41,008
ls she the wife of a hoodlum?

76
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:46,548
She's the wife of the Pop of them all.
DCP Ram Shekhar Azad's wife.

77
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:53,024
He had given her the time, but hasn't
turned up. lf he doesn't come soon...

78
00:13:53,532 --> 00:13:58,265
Only God and she know
what will happen to our shop.

79
00:13:59,538 --> 00:14:00,163
No...

80
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:08,874
He's here.

81
00:14:09,248 --> 00:14:12,877
Save me and my shop.
l've built it with great effort.

82
00:14:13,386 --> 00:14:14,978
Nothing will happen to it.

83
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:21,015
Yes sir?
- Give this to madam.

84
00:14:21,661 --> 00:14:25,097
Sir, don't land me in trouble.

85
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:30,696
Either this or yourjob is in danger.
- l am frightened.

86
00:14:31,637 --> 00:14:35,869
So am l. lt's a matter of my job too.
Please give it to her.

87
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,477
Madam, sir has given this.

88
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:53,386
Your anger is justified.
This is no way to behave.

89
00:14:53,793 --> 00:14:57,422
Reaching at 12 for a 9 o'clock
appointment. l should be punished.

90
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:01,424
But it would be
dishonourable in public.

91
00:15:02,535 --> 00:15:06,437
Let's go home. l'll willingly
accept the punishment.

92
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,834
Shall we...?

93
00:15:11,977 --> 00:15:15,674
Sir... our shop.
We've lost our lives!

94
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:34,131
Oh my God! What happened?
Such a huge plaster!

95
00:15:34,567 --> 00:15:35,693
l...
- You did?

96
00:15:36,068 --> 00:15:38,502
No... the hospital.
That is why l got late.

97
00:15:39,572 --> 00:15:41,972
Let's finish shopping.
- To hell with it!

98
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:46,176
Tell me how and when this happened.
- To blazes with that. Let's go shop.

99
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:49,172
No, l don't want to buy anything!
Let's go home.

100
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:55,554
Go on. l'll send you everything home.
l'll send all the ornaments over.

101
00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:58,454
You don't understand.
l have to shop now.

102
00:15:58,858 --> 00:16:01,486
l said, l don't want to shop!
Let's go home.

103
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:06,360
You won't be angry?
- No, let's go.

104
00:16:10,236 --> 00:16:11,498
Chasing the thief...

105
00:16:12,371 --> 00:16:15,101
l hurt my foot.

106
00:16:15,574 --> 00:16:17,701
Normal for us cops.

107
00:16:19,378 --> 00:16:22,506
Easy.
- l told you where...there...

108
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:26,716
l made you wait at the jewelry shop.
l am sorry about that.

109
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:37,556
Why is your foot in plaster?

110
00:16:38,364 --> 00:16:39,456
Accident.

111
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,434
When did it occur?
- Just now.

112
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:44,963
What time?

113
00:16:46,806 --> 00:16:51,368
Quiet. Can't you see Papa is hurt?
And you're interrogating him?

114
00:16:54,814 --> 00:16:55,906
Gently...

115
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:58,582
These kids! Have you no shame?

116
00:16:59,819 --> 00:17:01,753
Careful...Sit down.

117
00:17:08,627 --> 00:17:11,460
But Mom, Papa...
- Enough. No more questions.

118
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,889
Go to bed. Don't bother Papa.

119
00:17:15,434 --> 00:17:18,426
Papa is in pain. Go on, babies.
- But he wasn't hurt earlier.

120
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:22,166
What happened? What...?
- A cup of tea.

121
00:17:22,641 --> 00:17:25,109
l'll get it. Don't trouble Papa.

122
00:17:27,746 --> 00:17:30,237
Come here. Both of you come here.

123
00:17:30,683 --> 00:17:33,015
You grill me like cops.

124
00:17:33,485 --> 00:17:35,783
Your Mummy is better than you.
So easy to convince.

125
00:17:36,021 --> 00:17:37,613
But you're lying.
- Yes.

126
00:17:37,857 --> 00:17:41,418
lt's bad to lie.
- l know. But this is something else.

127
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:44,385
What?
- l can't explain to you.

128
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:47,924
Now go to bed.
- How can we go just like that?

129
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:50,893
Where's our bribe?
- Pay up time? Take it.

130
00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:01,009
l don't know where
he breaks his leg...!

131
00:18:09,355 --> 00:18:12,017
Thank God you saved me
in the nick of time.

132
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:16,087
Else like your leg, mine too....
- l am always bang on time.

133
00:18:16,495 --> 00:18:20,363
That is why l am a DCP
l got you, too. Come on...

134
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,262
lsn't your leg hurting?
- My leg?

135
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:26,629
Yes.

136
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,487
Royal style...

137
00:18:52,898 --> 00:18:54,559
Regal mannerism

138
00:18:54,934 --> 00:18:57,494
You are beyond compare

139
00:18:59,571 --> 00:19:06,135
Mummy of Chunnu and Raju,
You are beyond compare

140
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,375
Beloved, don't be mad at me

141
00:19:09,748 --> 00:19:11,545
Romance or flirt with me

142
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:13,578
Don't break my heart

143
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,887
Who will you flirt with?

144
00:19:50,823 --> 00:19:54,315
Oh my dearest, l admit...

145
00:19:54,827 --> 00:19:58,354
l'm in the habit of being late

146
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:07,232
Don't follow me

147
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:11,037
l won't forgive you, no way

148
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:15,513
Please forgive me.
My heart and soul is yours

149
00:20:16,015 --> 00:20:20,384
l am nothing without you
You hold the key to my heart

150

l love you so much

154
00:20:59,892 --> 00:21:03,794
Everyone is aware of that

155
00:21:08,667 --> 00:21:16,301
Tell me, what will you do
with them if l am no more?

156
00:21:16,909 --> 00:21:20,640
My sweetheart, l admit
l have hurt you

157
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:25,139
l will apologise at home.
Don't malign me in public

158
00:21:59,952 --> 00:22:03,410
You make 100 promises
but keep just one

159
00:22:03,956 --> 00:22:07,653
My anger is justified

160
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:16,464
You do get angry...

161
00:22:16,969 --> 00:22:20,530
but you're forgiving.
You are great, my love

162
00:22:20,973 --> 00:22:22,531
Stop faking

163
00:22:22,975 --> 00:22:24,636
How long will you torment me?

164
00:22:24,977 --> 00:22:29,380
Till you forgive me. Spare
a thought for the romantic weather

165

You are beyond compare

171
00:23:08,987 --> 00:23:11,251
Distribute this to Rahim
and his friends.

172
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:13,924
We're doing great business today.
And to ask for anything he needs.

173
00:23:15,694 --> 00:23:16,626
Help!

174
00:23:20,999 --> 00:23:21,931
Help!

175
00:23:27,439 --> 00:23:29,339
Who are you?
Why are you troubling her?

176
00:23:30,676 --> 00:23:32,473
Get out of here!
- Don't you know who l am?

177
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:34,939
Let's see what's up.
- Yeah.

178
00:23:37,182 --> 00:23:38,444
How dare you!

179
00:23:41,186 --> 00:23:42,881
Let go of me!

180
00:23:43,288 --> 00:23:46,086
Somebody is thrashing brother!
Hurry!

181
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:51,448
Bullying around, eh?

182
00:24:55,127 --> 00:24:57,254
Sir, listen to me.

183
00:25:09,074 --> 00:25:12,168
Sir! Let me go!
Listen to me.

184
00:25:40,005 --> 00:25:42,303
Youngsters these days don't
have money in their wallets.

185
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:46,401
lnstead they carry pictures of
their girl friend or film stars.

186
00:25:47,145 --> 00:25:52,913
lf it's a cultured person,
he carries a picture of his parents.

187
00:25:54,186 --> 00:25:57,087
But my picture in this...?
l don't get it.

188
00:25:57,522 --> 00:26:00,650
Every life has a purpose.

189
00:26:01,126 --> 00:26:04,823
An aspiring politician carries
Nehru or Shastri's picture.

190
00:26:05,197 --> 00:26:09,463
A social worker will
carry Mother Teresa's.

191
00:26:09,868 --> 00:26:14,396
A scientist will have a picture
of Bharat Ratna, Abdul Kalam.

192
00:26:16,141 --> 00:26:19,872
You are our ideal, our model.

193
00:26:21,146 --> 00:26:24,843
We want to be police officers
like you. So we have your picture.

194
00:26:27,552 --> 00:26:30,453
lt's notjust us, every
youngster of our nation...

195
00:26:30,689 --> 00:26:34,125
aspiring to be a police officer...
you are their ideal.

196
00:26:34,893 --> 00:26:38,795
We've never met you.
But you mean the world to us.

197
00:26:43,201 --> 00:26:46,329
You are the torch of hope for them.

198
00:26:47,205 --> 00:26:49,537
All of them want to
join the police force

199
00:26:50,008 --> 00:26:52,841
This...is my younger brother, Rahim.

200
00:26:54,212 --> 00:26:56,942
That's Balwinder, Vivek and Manoj.

201
00:26:57,816 --> 00:27:01,752
Look at their faces.
Glowing at meeting you.

202
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:05,915
l love them more than my brothers.

203
00:27:14,933 --> 00:27:17,128
Those who want to become something,
do something in life...

204
00:27:17,502 --> 00:27:20,801
and carve their own path..
l always support such men.

205
00:27:21,339 --> 00:27:25,503
All of you will succeed in
your mission. You have my blessings.

206
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:31,806
Long live...
- Veer Bahadur Singh!

207
00:27:37,589 --> 00:27:38,487
Greetings!

208
00:27:58,043 --> 00:27:58,975
Greetings!

209
00:28:00,812 --> 00:28:03,144
l'm Veer Bahadur Singh.

210
00:28:04,416 --> 00:28:10,286
This name is not known much here.
But it is widely known in UP.

211
00:28:11,389 --> 00:28:15,189
l don't have to take permission
from the police there...

212
00:28:15,594 --> 00:28:18,427
to take out a rally
or have a meeting.

213
00:28:19,264 --> 00:28:22,631
lf my boys stick a poster...

214
00:28:22,968 --> 00:28:29,897
the lG, DlG come running to
my house with folded arms.

215
00:28:31,409 --> 00:28:33,502
That is my glory.

216
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:39,683
Last year, a cop spoke
rudely to one of my boys.

217
00:28:40,252 --> 00:28:45,212
l got 15 buses burnt over it.
And instigated a riot.

218
00:28:45,991 --> 00:28:47,925
You must have read
it in the papers.

219
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:51,961
Here's more.

220
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:58,394
My younger brother
teased a girl a little.

221
00:28:59,337 --> 00:29:01,601
She was moving around
as if she were Madhuri Dixit.

222
00:29:02,007 --> 00:29:03,941
Young blood, so he got carried away.

223
00:29:04,943 --> 00:29:08,174
The girl slapped
my brother on the face.

224
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:14,416
Do you what l did?

225
00:29:17,222 --> 00:29:20,885
First l paraded her nude
in the market-place.

226
00:29:22,527 --> 00:29:24,392
Then l set her on fire.

227
00:29:26,331 --> 00:29:30,028
Nobody uttered a word.
That is my power.

228
00:29:31,369 --> 00:29:36,432
lf l stand at a place for
2 minutes, a meeting begins.

229
00:29:37,142 --> 00:29:39,576
lf l walk away,
the procession follows.

230
00:29:40,145 --> 00:29:42,978
lf l lie down,
there will be strikes.

231
00:29:44,749 --> 00:29:50,585
You must be thinking, if l'm doing
so well there, why have l come here?

232
00:29:52,557 --> 00:29:56,288
You seem like a honest, simple man.
So l'll tell you.

233
00:29:57,195 --> 00:30:00,528
l want to make my regional party
a national one.

234
00:30:01,366 --> 00:30:05,302
Politics rules from Delhi.
Till we have a couple of MPs...

235
00:30:06,037 --> 00:30:07,971
How will we get the suitcase?

236
00:30:08,373 --> 00:30:11,536
And till the suitcase
is filled with cash...

237
00:30:11,943 --> 00:30:14,377
what's the point
in dabbling in politics?

238
00:30:15,113 --> 00:30:19,709
That's why l have come here to improve
the prospects of my party and myself.

239
00:30:21,353 --> 00:30:26,347
l'll instigate strikes here. Take
out processions, smash things up.

240
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:30,556
Only then will the public here
notice us. Do you follow?

241
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:33,864
Let me make one thing clear.

242
00:30:34,432 --> 00:30:38,163
My meetings have more
of my own men than public.

243
00:30:38,637 --> 00:30:44,769
And my instructions to them are if
anybody moves around, create a scene.

244
00:30:45,143 --> 00:30:49,045
That is why send as
many cops as you can.

245
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:54,550
Not for my protection.
For the public protection.

246
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:58,747
And... send cops in full pants.

247
00:30:59,491 --> 00:31:06,090
Don't send women cops. Lest their
smooth cheeks... get my point?

248
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:46,601
l don't want the permission...

249
00:31:56,781 --> 00:32:00,080
How long since we gained independence?
- l don't know.

250
00:32:00,485 --> 00:32:04,080
Languages spoken in lndia? How many?
- No idea.

251
00:32:04,489 --> 00:32:07,083
What's the population of our country?
- l don't know.

252
00:32:07,492 --> 00:32:10,928
What is our national song?
- l...don't know.

253
00:32:12,297 --> 00:32:13,264
When you don't know the
history of this country...

254
00:32:15,834 --> 00:32:19,326
its geography and culture,
you call yourself a leader?

255
00:32:27,112 --> 00:32:29,444
Meetings begin if you stand up, eh?

256
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:32,245
You walk, and a procession follows?

257
00:32:32,717 --> 00:32:36,084
Strikes are announced
if you lie down? ls that so?

258
00:32:39,557 --> 00:32:44,153
You are not at fault.
The day you raised this hand...

259
00:32:44,562 --> 00:32:46,291
in the name of caste or religion...

260
00:32:46,564 --> 00:32:49,294
had a police officer chopped
off this hand on that day...

261
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:53,502
you wouldn't have dared stomp into
the police commissioner's office!

262
00:32:54,572 --> 00:32:59,509
What did you say? Don't send
women police? Their smooth cheeks...

263
00:33:09,554 --> 00:33:12,045
Sign it.
- But it is blank.

264
00:33:12,557 --> 00:33:16,653
Yes, we'll write...
l, Veer Bahadur Singh...

265
00:33:17,262 --> 00:33:21,289
am a thief and a murderer. l have
burnt buses and instigated riots.

266
00:33:21,699 --> 00:33:27,296
l set a girl on fire.
l admit to all these crimes.

267
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,505
Sign it.
- Forgive me.

268
00:33:40,618 --> 00:33:45,112
After today, if l see any politician
like yourself in my office..

269
00:33:45,623 --> 00:33:47,352
l will chop the legs off.

270
00:33:55,633 --> 00:33:58,363
l send off my guests with honour.

271
00:34:02,307 --> 00:34:04,036
Place your hand on my shoulder.

272
00:34:04,576 --> 00:34:05,838
Your hand!

273
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:08,305
Smile...smile!

274
00:34:09,113 --> 00:34:10,045
Let's go.

275
00:34:10,682 --> 00:34:13,913
You're such a great leader while
l'm a mere police commissioner.

276
00:34:14,285 --> 00:34:16,310
l served you all
l could with my hands.

277
00:34:16,754 --> 00:34:20,952
lf my hospitality was lacking, do
be sure to drop in again. Smile.

278
00:34:21,626 --> 00:34:23,560
Long live...
- Veer Bahadur Singh!

279
00:34:38,443 --> 00:34:40,377
The job is done. Please leave.

280
00:34:43,848 --> 00:34:45,577
Long live..
- Jairam.

281
00:34:57,629 --> 00:34:59,722
l am honoured to meet you.

282
00:35:03,167 --> 00:35:06,227
Good day. ls all well?

283
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:11,370
Like yourself, l've come from Bihar
to Maharashtra to set up my party.

284
00:35:12,744 --> 00:35:16,578
Rally or procession begins tomorrow.
l've come to take permission.

285
00:35:17,649 --> 00:35:20,516
Did you too come here for the same?
- Yes.

286
00:35:20,919 --> 00:35:25,083
Got it? No problem if you haven't,
l'll get it for you.

287
00:35:25,556 --> 00:35:28,218
l've got it.
- And why won't we get it?

288
00:35:28,693 --> 00:35:35,155
We're great leaders. Will a mere
commissioner not give us permission?

289
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:38,635
He will.
- He will have to.

290
00:35:39,304 --> 00:35:41,864
lf he won't,
l'll teach him a lesson!

291
00:35:43,441 --> 00:35:44,408
Teach him a lesson?

292
00:35:44,909 --> 00:35:48,401
Yes. What do you think of me?

293
00:35:48,913 --> 00:35:54,146
Many commissioners like him came
and went. But Jairam continues.

294
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:58,017
You guys wait. l'll go in
and return in a moment.

295
00:36:03,194 --> 00:36:04,126
Go on.

296
00:36:08,866 --> 00:36:14,771
Your name is Jairam, no?
Today you will meet your end.

297
00:36:24,449 --> 00:36:27,384
l am such a famous leader!

298
00:36:43,468 --> 00:36:45,095
Look, l don't want any permission.

299
00:36:53,277 --> 00:36:54,801
Hand on my shoulder.
- Pardon...?

300
00:36:55,179 --> 00:36:56,146
Do it!

301
00:36:56,781 --> 00:36:58,749
Smile. Smile!

302
00:37:00,485 --> 00:37:01,349
Let's go.

303
00:37:01,919 --> 00:37:04,285
You are a leader of the country.

304
00:37:04,756 --> 00:37:07,987
l'm a mere police commissioner
at your service.

305
00:37:08,259 --> 00:37:10,750
lf you ever you need to
recall a lesson, do come over.

306
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:12,457
Come on.

307
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:18,668
The public is waiting for you.

308
00:37:38,489 --> 00:37:43,188
Taught the lesson?
- Taught and vomited it out too.

309
00:37:44,796 --> 00:37:46,923
And what about you?

310
00:37:50,902 --> 00:37:51,459
Sir, we've tried every trick.

311
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:59,065
We haven't got any clue or
information from Wasim Khan.

312
00:37:59,544 --> 00:38:02,342
That is why, we are of the opinion
that this case be handed over...

313
00:38:02,747 --> 00:38:06,683
to the lnvestigation Bureau.
- No, no. Sorry.

314
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:10,185
The police of the world
couldn't arrest him.

315
00:38:10,588 --> 00:38:12,488
Who arrested that Wasim Khan?

316
00:38:12,924 --> 00:38:14,824
An officer of the Maharashtra Police.

317
00:38:15,526 --> 00:38:17,391
This is a matter of honour for us.

318
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:21,731
Now only because we can't
get him to confess...

319
00:38:22,567 --> 00:38:24,535
we should hand this case to the CBl?

320
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:28,733
Have you ever thought what humiliation
it'll bring to our department?

321
00:38:29,907 --> 00:38:34,037
No, this case won't be
handed over to the CBl.

322
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:37,804
An efficient officer from our
department will handle it.

323
00:38:38,216 --> 00:38:42,118
Why don't we give this case to
the officer who arrested Wasim Khan...

324
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:45,080
and brought honour to us?
- Absolutely.

325
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:49,788
Who could be better than DCP Azad?
He has forced many to confess.

326
00:38:51,462 --> 00:38:53,453
Mr Azad, what have you to say?

327
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:59,468
l am willing to take this case.
But l must lay down some conditions.

328
00:38:59,804 --> 00:39:02,534
Conditions?
- We imprison criminals...

329
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:06,408
to reform them.
But this doesn't happen.

330
00:39:06,811 --> 00:39:10,542
All prisons have become their dens.
They run their kingdoms...

331
00:39:10,815 --> 00:39:16,219
using cellular phones. We can't
interrogate Wasim Khan in such jails.

332
00:39:17,588 --> 00:39:20,455
l want a special cell for Wasim Khan.

333
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:23,452
Only officers selected by me
will be appointed to it.

334
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:41,401
The DCP is on his way.

335
00:40:01,933 --> 00:40:05,733
How are you?
- Fine. Thanks for selecting me.

336
00:40:06,204 --> 00:40:07,136
Please.

337
00:40:11,943 --> 00:40:13,535
Sir, take a look.

338
00:40:15,646 --> 00:40:18,877
Just as you desired
all arrangements have been made.

339
00:40:19,684 --> 00:40:23,211
The most senior of officer
cannot enter without your permission.

340
00:40:23,988 --> 00:40:26,548
Look. there are
close circuit cameras all around.

341
00:40:26,991 --> 00:40:32,725
We can view every inch of the cell.
Specially Wasim Khan.

342
00:40:34,999 --> 00:40:36,933
Sir, come along.

343
00:41:13,704 --> 00:41:16,935
Nobody can step ahead of here.
Except you.

344
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:21,471
The weapons given to you
are for his protection.

345
00:41:22,713 --> 00:41:25,181
He should not be hurt because of you.

346
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:32,783
He is very smart.
He will try to instigate you.

347
00:41:33,057 --> 00:41:35,457
Make you lose your temper,
but keep your cool.

348
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:39,427
You had chopped the arms of
the Dadar hood in a fit of rage.

349
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:41,320
Don't repeat that mistake.

350
00:42:24,075 --> 00:42:27,602
You've made great arrangements.
But it won't help.

351
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:33,813
You're wasting government money.
Special officers... a special cell...

352
00:42:34,251 --> 00:42:37,186
tight security... all a waste.

353
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:48,628
You can't get any clue or evidence
out of me. Not now, not ever.

354
00:42:54,672 --> 00:42:58,403
Because your power ends
with these bars.

355
00:42:59,143 --> 00:43:04,479
But you can't imagine how
far reaching my powers are.

356
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:10,820
Past tense, sorry. Now you are
restricted only to this place.

357
00:43:11,856 --> 00:43:16,350
And the rest of your life, the little
that is left, you'll spend it here.

358
00:43:18,863 --> 00:43:22,355
You're a mere cop not the
PM or President that..

359
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,563
your whims will be pandered to.

360
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:31,573
But l can do as l please. Because
l have man power, money power.

361
00:43:33,144 --> 00:43:35,578
l can leave this place
whenever l wish.

362
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:42,817
This isn't your aunt's house. where
you leave or enter when you please.

363
00:43:47,191 --> 00:43:51,753
Forget getting out of here, you
can't take a breath without my wish.

364
00:43:53,998 --> 00:43:56,296
l can do as l please!

365
00:43:56,767 --> 00:44:00,362
Right here, in front of your eyes,
l can ruin your country!

366
00:44:00,805 --> 00:44:03,035
Because there's no dearth of men
from your country who will...

367
00:44:03,274 --> 00:44:05,834
sell themselves and
their nation for money!

368
00:44:06,210 --> 00:44:09,839
There are also those who will
sacrifice themselves for their nation!

369
00:44:10,414 --> 00:44:12,848
Even if we don't
get 2 meals a day..

370
00:44:13,284 --> 00:44:15,718
no clothes to wear, nor
a roof over our heads..

371
00:44:16,187 --> 00:44:19,179
we risk our lives for
the honour of our country.

372
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:22,251
We've proved this to you many times!
ln 65! 71 ! And also in Kargil!

373
00:44:22,927 --> 00:44:26,090
Have you forgotten?
- We've forgotten nothing.

374
00:44:27,932 --> 00:44:30,730
Every wound is still fresh.

375
00:44:31,202 --> 00:44:36,003
That is why we've decided
not to fight you on the borders.

376
00:44:36,407 --> 00:44:40,434
We'll get in and
divide Hindustan to bits!

377
00:44:58,329 --> 00:45:02,265
You are alive because
you are in my custody.

378
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:07,097
We know how to shake hands
as well as rip it out.

379
00:45:07,972 --> 00:45:11,772
We worship Gandhiji
and Chandra Shekhar Azad!

380
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:17,241
l too first talk with love.
Then l use my weapon.

381
00:45:19,183 --> 00:45:23,119
How would you like to understand?
Make up your mind.

382
00:45:48,245 --> 00:45:50,179
Our names aren't in this list.

383
00:45:52,983 --> 00:45:54,507
Let's go out.

384
00:45:59,790 --> 00:46:02,588
l don't understand..
- What could the problem be?

385
00:46:02,993 --> 00:46:04,893
Can't be get recruited?
- Why not?

386
00:46:05,229 --> 00:46:07,163
Move aside.

387
00:46:08,566 --> 00:46:12,161
Sir, we fared well in the test.
- Chest, height, everything perfect.

388
00:46:12,503 --> 00:46:15,961
We scored the highest in
High Jump and Long Jump.

389
00:46:16,373 --> 00:46:20,833
Our names aren't in this list.
- Your computer could be faulty.

390
00:46:21,879 --> 00:46:25,406
Nothing wrong with the computer.
The entire system is wrong.

391
00:46:25,816 --> 00:46:29,843
The list that you see,
the senior officers made it.

392
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:34,189
Obviously they will write the names
of their own men, not of strangers.

393
00:46:34,825 --> 00:46:40,695
Take my advice. Don't waste time for
this job. Look for something else.

394
00:46:41,165 --> 00:46:42,564
But sir...

395
00:47:24,375 --> 00:47:27,742
Didn't l tell you, l can do anything?

396
00:47:28,312 --> 00:47:31,247
Watch how l send
my message to my men.

397
00:48:31,375 --> 00:48:34,173
Sir, Shinde here.
Wasim Khan is beating up Patil.

398
00:48:34,611 --> 00:48:35,543
What?

399
00:48:37,147 --> 00:48:40,514
Don't hurt Wasim Khan.
l'm on my way.

400
00:48:58,502 --> 00:48:59,434
Come on.

401
00:49:12,549 --> 00:49:16,383
He had taken his dinner.
All of a sudden, Khan attacked.

402
00:49:23,427 --> 00:49:25,622
Don't worry.
Everything will be fine.

403
00:49:32,169 --> 00:49:34,103
Take him to the hospital.

404
00:50:00,497 --> 00:50:02,226
He'll come around in 2 hours.

405
00:51:07,364 --> 00:51:08,262
Read.

406
00:51:15,639 --> 00:51:17,368
Protest against inflation!

407
00:51:25,482 --> 00:51:28,212
Didn't l say, l could do anything?

408
00:51:29,653 --> 00:51:31,814
lt's only about a
month since my arrest.

409
00:51:34,625 --> 00:51:40,291
But l planned this thing just
a few days ago. Just a few days ago.

410
00:51:45,869 --> 00:51:49,532
ln a short while, my men
will be participating.

411
00:51:57,147 --> 00:51:59,547
Then slogans will turn into screams.

412
00:52:05,589 --> 00:52:11,323
Sitting in your special cell,
l will murder thousands.

413
00:52:12,863 --> 00:52:17,527
You're a valiant officer, aren't you?
Save these lives if you can.

414
00:52:26,376 --> 00:52:28,207
Sir, there's rioting in Jogeshwari.

415
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:48,927
Control room? DCP Azad here.

416
00:52:49,399 --> 00:52:52,163
Send the ambulance and fire
brigade to Jogeshwari immediately.

417
00:52:55,806 --> 00:53:00,209
Tell the men it's a planned riot.
So there should be no lathi-charge.

418
00:53:00,610 --> 00:53:03,545
They should somehow
try to calm the public.

419
00:55:05,702 --> 00:55:08,500
Speaking.
- Before beating up Wasim Khan...

420
00:55:08,905 --> 00:55:11,305
won't you like to know who he is?

421
00:55:12,375 --> 00:55:16,368
Despite being imprisoned, how did he
organise the procession...

422
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:21,717
followed by the riot?
lf you wish to find out...

423
00:55:22,352 --> 00:55:25,719
meet me at Sassoon Dock
at 1 1 tonight.

424
00:55:27,791 --> 00:55:28,723
All right.

425
00:56:30,987 --> 00:56:34,445
Did you talk to me on the phone?
- Yes. l asked you to come here.

426
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:42,964
You know about Wasim Khan...?

427
00:56:44,634 --> 00:56:48,536
Yes, Wasim Khan is
notjust a terrorist...

428
00:56:52,642 --> 00:56:56,043
he's part of a powerful
international racket.

429
00:56:57,914 --> 00:57:01,748
We can keep him in custody.
Not in our control.

430
00:57:03,019 --> 00:57:04,782
Nobody can control him.

431
00:57:07,591 --> 00:57:10,492
My problems have multiplied
since you arrested him.

432
00:57:11,895 --> 00:57:14,455
lf you take any severe steps
against him...

433
00:57:14,965 --> 00:57:17,160
it will snowball into
an international issue.

434
00:57:18,635 --> 00:57:21,832
lt will be dangerous keeping him
in custody for long.

435
00:57:22,906 --> 00:57:28,310
So he must be safely sent out
of lndia as soon as possible.

436
00:57:29,913 --> 00:57:32,040
Have you any idea of
what you're saying?

437
00:57:44,094 --> 00:57:46,358
You know Wasim Khan very well.

438
00:57:47,097 --> 00:57:50,362
He was behind the
riots in Jogeshwari.

439
00:57:50,767 --> 00:57:52,860
He did it despite
being in my custody.

440
00:57:53,370 --> 00:57:55,702
Many innocent lives
were lost because of him.

441
00:57:56,139 --> 00:58:01,133
And you want me to release him?
No, sir. l won't release him alive.

442
00:58:01,645 --> 00:58:06,514
l'll kill him. Only his corpse will
leave the country. Only his corpse.

443
00:58:06,983 --> 00:58:10,612
Riots keep taking place.
People keep dying.

444
00:58:11,054 --> 00:58:13,147
What's the point
in getting emotional?

445
00:58:18,061 --> 00:58:20,894
Learn to ignore certain
things if you want to progress.

446
00:58:22,532 --> 00:58:24,898
When did you hear about the riots?
- This morning.

447
00:58:25,368 --> 00:58:27,700
l knew 2 days in advance.
- What...?

448
00:58:28,972 --> 00:58:32,430
You knew 2 days earlier?
- That's not all.

449
00:58:36,980 --> 00:58:39,540
Wasim Khan was in Maharashtra
for the past 2 months.

450
00:58:39,983 --> 00:58:41,917
He was safe because of me.

451
00:58:43,219 --> 00:58:46,552
Nobody arrested him.
You made this mistake.

452
00:58:46,990 --> 00:58:48,924
A big mistake.

453
00:58:52,028 --> 00:58:54,496
Wasim Khan is very annoyed at this.

454
00:59:02,872 --> 00:59:06,672
l know you love Anjali and the kids.

455
00:59:07,777 --> 00:59:12,214
You won't understand. They are
power players of a high grade.

456
00:59:12,716 --> 00:59:18,882
Don't get involved. Arrange to
send Wasim Khan out safely.

457
00:59:20,990 --> 00:59:26,895
lf your conscience bothers you,
take a break with your family.

458
00:59:28,331 --> 00:59:30,231
l'll organise everything.

459
00:59:36,773 --> 00:59:37,705
Listen...

460
00:59:38,007 --> 00:59:41,602
don't be upset at news of the deaths
of the officers in your special cell.

461
00:59:42,712 --> 00:59:46,614
Because they have to die in order
for Wasim Khan to get out.

462
01:00:01,865 --> 01:00:05,995
Be a friend to a friend

463
01:00:07,203 --> 01:00:11,503
Be an enemy to a foe

464
01:00:12,175 --> 01:00:16,669
Live not, die not like cowards

465
01:00:17,213 --> 01:00:22,014
The earth and the sky say...

466
01:00:22,819 --> 01:00:27,586
don't break the heart
of your motherland

467
01:00:28,091 --> 01:00:32,357
Don't spare the traitors

468
01:00:33,329 --> 01:00:37,766
You have to live for your nation

469
01:00:38,334 --> 01:00:43,067
Do your duty

470
01:01:41,197 --> 01:01:43,461
Dispose off this body.

471
01:02:03,353 --> 01:02:05,651
l've been waiting for so long.
Come inside.

472
01:02:07,156 --> 01:02:08,885
What are you looking at?
Come on in.

473
01:02:10,159 --> 01:02:12,354
Sit. l have
to tell you something.

474
01:02:13,396 --> 01:02:15,091
l am so happy!

475
01:02:18,601 --> 01:02:19,499
One minute.

476
01:02:27,210 --> 01:02:29,701
Here's your favourite dish.
Take a quick bite.

477
01:02:31,548 --> 01:02:35,143
Do you know why? Read the paper.

478
01:02:37,287 --> 01:02:40,154
Director General of Police,
Mr Suryapratap honoured

479
01:02:46,996 --> 01:02:48,623
Papa has won the state award.

480
01:02:51,267 --> 01:02:52,598
You know...

481
01:02:55,405 --> 01:02:57,202
how much l love Papa.

482
01:02:58,274 --> 01:03:01,141
Yet l didn't go to meet him.
l didn't even call.

483
01:03:01,945 --> 01:03:05,472
Do you know why?
Because you're his only son-in-law.

484
01:03:06,916 --> 01:03:11,285
lf we go to wish him together,
he will be very happy.

485
01:03:12,221 --> 01:03:14,212
l've even ordered
a special garland.

486
01:03:43,686 --> 01:03:44,744
Move aside!

487
01:04:47,884 --> 01:04:51,285
We'd given up hope of
becoming police officers.

488
01:04:52,221 --> 01:04:55,247
We could have turned to crime
out of depression.

489
01:04:55,692 --> 01:05:00,686
You saved us from turning into
criminals by accepting us.

490
01:05:01,564 --> 01:05:04,931
But we are confused.
We don't understand you.

491
01:05:06,335 --> 01:05:10,101
You killed the DGP and
you're cremating him.

492
01:05:10,540 --> 01:05:13,668
l am doing my duty.
- We don't understand.

493
01:05:14,077 --> 01:05:16,568
l shot him because
l'm a son of this country.

494
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:19,947
l am his son-in-law
so l am cremating him.

495
01:05:20,349 --> 01:05:24,615
You killed him because he was
hand in glove with Wasim Khan.

496
01:05:24,954 --> 01:05:28,287
Why is Wasim Khan alive?
- l can kill him anytime.

497
01:05:29,358 --> 01:05:31,292
But he's not the real enemy.

498
01:05:32,128 --> 01:05:36,064
The real foes are those who are
weakening their own country.

499
01:05:36,599 --> 01:05:39,466
l never imagined
the DGP could do this.

500
01:05:40,069 --> 01:05:42,037
l wonder how many more
there are.

501
01:05:42,605 --> 01:05:45,039
l can get to them
only through Wasim Khan.

502
01:05:45,475 --> 01:05:47,966
That is why it is important
that Wasim Khan lives.

503
01:06:06,195 --> 01:06:07,253
Please come in.

504
01:06:16,405 --> 01:06:20,501
Don't you feel the CBl is
more busy than the police?

505
01:06:22,879 --> 01:06:26,872
Earlier when there
would be some scam...

506
01:06:27,416 --> 01:06:32,046
Bofors or fodder scams...
then we'd be called in.

507
01:06:33,156 --> 01:06:37,991
But these days... don't ask.
Match fixing, catch fixing...

508
01:06:39,128 --> 01:06:41,995
when a canal isn't built,
the gutter isn't dug...

509
01:06:43,599 --> 01:06:45,829
even the smallest case goes
to the lnvestigation Bureau.

510
01:06:47,670 --> 01:06:50,036
l'm thinking of writing
to the Home Minister.

511
01:06:50,439 --> 01:06:55,376
To have CBl cells in place
of police stations in the villages

512
01:06:57,780 --> 01:06:59,372
What do you think?

513
01:06:59,715 --> 01:07:04,550
Forget it. l'm always cracking jokes.
Let me get to the point.

514
01:07:07,390 --> 01:07:10,484
The man who was murdered
wasn'tjust your father-in-law.

515
01:07:12,128 --> 01:07:13,823
He was also the DGP.

516
01:07:16,499 --> 01:07:23,098
Tell me, any close relation of
your father-in-law or a close friend.

517
01:07:23,539 --> 01:07:30,377
You are funny. Generally officers
ask if the deceased had an enemy.

518
01:07:31,013 --> 01:07:33,379
And you ask about
friends and relatives.

519
01:07:35,151 --> 01:07:40,054
My method is different. Anyway,
whether it's the nation or home...

520
01:07:40,656 --> 01:07:42,988
one is more at risk from
your own than strangers.

521
01:07:45,461 --> 01:07:49,989
He had nobody but us.
l was his only friend.

522
01:07:50,499 --> 01:07:52,399
Then did you kill him?

523
01:07:55,238 --> 01:07:57,433
l said, l'm always fooling around.

524
01:07:59,275 --> 01:08:03,644
Anyway, whoever murdered him
did it with intelligence.

525
01:08:04,614 --> 01:08:08,550
Obviously one needs
more intelligence to get to him.

526
01:08:09,452 --> 01:08:12,046
lntelligence isn't
sold in the market.

527
01:08:13,055 --> 01:08:14,989
But we must try.

528
01:08:16,525 --> 01:08:18,390
l'll now take leave.

529
01:08:20,263 --> 01:08:23,630
l'll be coming frequently
till the murderer is found.

530
01:08:37,280 --> 01:08:38,440
Excuse me!

531
01:08:44,620 --> 01:08:46,451
Look, don't cry.

532
01:08:47,323 --> 01:08:51,692
l promise you l will find the
killer of your father very soon.

533
01:08:52,295 --> 01:08:56,095
Whoever he is, wherever he be,
l will find him.

534
01:08:56,699 --> 01:09:01,659
My Papa was a police officer.
My husband too is a police officer.

535
01:09:02,171 --> 01:09:05,436
lf the one who killed Papa,
kills my husband...

536
01:09:06,208 --> 01:09:10,838
Please do something fast.
l'm very scared.

537
01:09:27,863 --> 01:09:31,993
The deed has been done. Don't upset
yourself with these thoughts.

538
01:09:33,302 --> 01:09:35,031
Nothing will harm me.

539
01:10:13,376 --> 01:10:15,003
lqbal Khan here.
- Go on.

540
01:10:15,344 --> 01:10:18,108
Wasim Khan hit Shinde
just as he beat Patil.

541
01:10:18,514 --> 01:10:21,779
What...?
Take him to the hospital.

542
01:10:23,886 --> 01:10:27,378
What's wrong?
- Wasim Khan hit Shinde.

543
01:10:29,425 --> 01:10:32,758
There were riots in Jogeshwari
when he beat up Patil.

544
01:10:33,662 --> 01:10:35,926
Today he beat up Shinde.
l wonder if something...

545
01:11:19,708 --> 01:11:23,075
Come to Wadia Hospital right away.
There's a note in Shinde's pocket.

546
01:11:23,479 --> 01:11:26,243
Follow the one who collects it,
wherever he takes it to.

547
01:11:26,715 --> 01:11:29,206
Call me if there's any problem.

548
01:11:29,718 --> 01:11:32,653
Remember, you have nothing
to do with the police.

549
01:12:49,498 --> 01:12:51,489
This is love

550
01:12:52,101 --> 01:12:55,730
A high of life

551
01:12:59,041 --> 01:13:04,707
No heart can escape love

552
01:13:06,782 --> 01:13:09,842
Everyone has to fall in love

553
01:13:10,352 --> 01:13:13,719
You have to lose your heart someday

554
01:13:14,456 --> 01:13:17,687
You have to fall in love

555
01:13:58,667 --> 01:14:01,602
Love is full of excitement

556
01:14:06,008 --> 01:14:09,409
Love is full of excitement

557
01:14:09,912 --> 01:14:13,245
There's no fun
in turning down love

558
01:14:13,716 --> 01:14:17,117
Love is full of excitement

559
01:14:17,553 --> 01:14:20,750
There's no fun
in turning down love

560
01:14:21,557 --> 01:14:24,890
No point in fighting,
love will win over you

561
01:15:19,081 --> 01:15:22,482
Even the agony
of love is acceptable

562
01:15:22,885 --> 01:15:26,412
Love gives immense pleasure

563
01:15:26,889 --> 01:15:30,484
Even the agony
of love is acceptable

564
01:15:30,893 --> 01:15:34,056
Love gives immense pleasure

565
01:15:34,530 --> 01:15:37,829
Don't sigh, fall in love

566
01:17:03,752 --> 01:17:07,085
Yes, Rahim?
- They suspect me! They are after me.

567
01:17:07,523 --> 01:17:09,889
Where are you?
- Running from Parel towards Dadar.

568
01:17:10,292 --> 01:17:13,887
How far are you from them?
- About 100 feet. They will kill me!

569
01:17:14,496 --> 01:17:18,364
Don't worry. Keep running.
l'll look after everything.

570
01:17:45,327 --> 01:17:46,954
This is DCP Azad.

571
01:17:49,465 --> 01:17:52,798
There's a bomb in your theater.
Vacate everybody immediately.

572
01:17:53,202 --> 01:17:53,998
Bomb...?

573
01:17:54,203 --> 01:17:55,693
Bomb! Run!!

574
01:18:27,069 --> 01:18:28,832
l won't spare you!

575
01:18:33,075 --> 01:18:36,476
Are you all right?
- Yes. That was a great idea.

576
01:18:36,879 --> 01:18:38,813
Those guys would have killed me.

577
01:18:41,083 --> 01:18:43,677
The lmam of Jama Masjid is
arriving by the morning flight.

578
01:18:44,086 --> 01:18:46,680
There was talk of
killing him at the airport.

579
01:18:47,089 --> 01:18:48,351
The lmam?

580
01:18:50,092 --> 01:18:52,026
Why would they want to kill him?

581
01:19:25,093 --> 01:19:28,028
lnform me if you see any of them.

582
01:19:30,198 --> 01:19:32,758
No passenger should
go close to the lmam.

583
01:19:43,145 --> 01:19:48,412
No VlP or VlP goes in till
he is thoroughly searched.

584
01:19:50,419 --> 01:19:53,752
Yes? All ready?
- Everything as you instructed.

585
01:19:54,156 --> 01:19:58,058
Tiwari is on Gate 1 .
Shanbag on Gate 2 and Sharma on 3.

586
01:19:58,894 --> 01:20:02,386
The flight touches down at 7
The lmam will be at Gate 1 at 7.15

587
01:20:02,898 --> 01:20:05,560
l've arranged 150 special
commandos as you'd said.

588
01:20:05,867 --> 01:20:08,131
They will assemble outside
the airport at 7.

589
01:20:08,337 --> 01:20:12,433
They will be with us till the lmam
takes the evening flight to Delhi.

590
01:20:13,075 --> 01:20:15,407
May l ask something
if you don't mind?

591
01:20:16,945 --> 01:20:19,106
So much security for an lmam?

592
01:20:19,548 --> 01:20:21,948
We didn't have this much
security even for Bill Clinton.

593
01:20:22,284 --> 01:20:27,153
The lmam is here for a
Hindu-Muslim Unity meeting.

594
01:20:27,956 --> 01:20:30,117
We've got information
somebody wants to kill him.

595
01:20:30,492 --> 01:20:34,826
lf this happens, there will be
riots in Bombay and the entire nation.

596
01:20:35,230 --> 01:20:38,222
Thousands of people will be killed.
And l don't want this to happen.

597
01:20:39,267 --> 01:20:41,167
That is the reason for this security.

598
01:21:00,989 --> 01:21:03,890
There's terrific security here.

599
01:21:04,660 --> 01:21:07,891
lt appears as if DCP Azad
knows of our plan.

600
01:21:08,463 --> 01:21:11,227
That is why he has kept
chosen officers on alert.

601
01:21:12,267 --> 01:21:15,168
We'll have to cancel the
plan to kill the lmam.

602
01:21:16,004 --> 01:21:19,462
lf the plan is canceled,
they will cancel our lives.

603
01:21:20,275 --> 01:21:24,268
You don't worry. The lmam will die
at the hands of a cop.

604
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:26,178
How?

605
01:21:27,015 --> 01:21:31,179
DCP Azad will call for a special
commando force for lmam's security.

606
01:21:32,054 --> 01:21:34,386
Pose yourself as a commando
and gain entry.

607
01:21:34,990 --> 01:21:40,292
You can exit after the job is done.
l'll be waiting for you right here.

608
01:22:00,248 --> 01:22:07,780
Attention, Flight lC 165
has arrived from Delhi.

609
01:22:25,049 --> 01:22:28,314
We have almost erased
terrorism from our country.

610
01:22:29,387 --> 01:22:32,982
But some serpents exist
that raise their hoods.

611
01:22:34,125 --> 01:22:38,721
Hence you and l will
have to be alert.

612
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:44,734
One small mistake on our part...

613
01:22:45,203 --> 01:22:47,831
can lead to a big problem
for our country.

614
01:23:00,618 --> 01:23:04,110
What's the tight security for?
ls the PM arriving?

615
01:23:04,889 --> 01:23:06,948
The security is for you.
- For me?

616
01:23:07,391 --> 01:23:09,791
Yes, your life is in danger.
- What...?

617
01:23:13,397 --> 01:23:18,334
lt's not one man's life at stake.
Many innocents can lose their lives.

618
01:24:00,444 --> 01:24:04,005
How did he identify the terrorist
amidst all these commandos?

619
01:24:04,448 --> 01:24:06,848
That's why DCP Azad is special.

620
01:24:07,251 --> 01:24:09,151
What does About Turn mean?
- Turn around.

621
01:24:09,453 --> 01:24:12,183
Correct. But he had instructed
the commandos...

622
01:24:12,523 --> 01:24:17,051
When l say About Turn, sit down.
The terrorist didn't know this.

623
01:24:17,461 --> 01:24:19,759
He turned around and went up.

624
01:24:20,698 --> 01:24:23,064
Sir, welcome to Mumbai.

625
01:24:24,168 --> 01:24:26,602
l promise you, you won't be hurt.

626
01:24:27,471 --> 01:24:29,200
Thank Allah.

627
01:24:30,341 --> 01:24:32,002
l am convinced..

628
01:24:32,310 --> 01:24:34,801
as long as officers like you
exist in this country....

629
01:24:35,179 --> 01:24:38,205
The conspiracy to split
Ram and Rahim will never succeed.

630
01:24:38,649 --> 01:24:40,844
Amen.
- Come along.

631
01:25:26,864 --> 01:25:28,798
Read it

632
01:25:33,337 --> 01:25:37,239
Smart man. You beat up my man,
plant a note in his pocket...

633
01:25:37,441 --> 01:25:40,638
so it reaches your guys
and they can kill the lmam.

634
01:25:41,746 --> 01:25:44,112
The Muslims will attack the Hindus
in retaliation...

635
01:25:44,348 --> 01:25:46,509
and it will spark off riots.

636
01:25:49,587 --> 01:25:51,521
But things haven't unfolded
as you wanted them to.

637
01:25:53,124 --> 01:25:55,524
That which l want will happen now.

638
01:25:57,061 --> 01:25:58,995
Didn't you say l'd find
no clue or trace of evidence?

639
01:26:00,197 --> 01:26:02,131
l have got my hands
on evidence.

640
01:26:05,936 --> 01:26:10,066
l'll first kill your men.
And then, l'll kill you.

641
01:26:40,337 --> 01:26:42,100
Go back a little.
- Yes, sir.

642
01:26:46,977 --> 01:26:48,877
Clear that, please.

643
01:26:53,017 --> 01:26:55,110
He's the one l shot
at the airport the other day.

644
01:26:55,653 --> 01:26:58,588
Who's that guy with him?
Zoom to him.

645
01:27:05,596 --> 01:27:06,790
Francis?

646
01:27:09,400 --> 01:27:12,233
Bhai, DCP Azad's headed here.
Let's run.

647
01:27:43,534 --> 01:27:45,559
Who sent you to the airport?
Tell me.

648
01:27:51,542 --> 01:27:53,567
Shankar Singh Kalia.

649
01:28:13,731 --> 01:28:17,565
Let there be peace...

650
01:28:35,986 --> 01:28:38,147
Great place.
l love it.

651
01:28:38,455 --> 01:28:41,618
lt's a very old temple.
More than 100 years old.

652
01:28:41,926 --> 01:28:44,292
And look how beautiful it is.
No trace of ageing.

653
01:28:44,628 --> 01:28:49,031
l'm talking about the 500-acres
of land around the temple.

654
01:28:50,201 --> 01:28:53,432
Priests can talk about temples.
And l'm a businessman.

655
01:28:54,205 --> 01:28:57,641
l like this piece of land
and l want to have it.

656
01:28:58,108 --> 01:28:59,973
But the land belongs to the temple.

657
01:29:00,878 --> 01:29:04,370
Whether it belongs to the temple or
it belongs to me, it's all the same

658
01:29:05,115 --> 01:29:09,950
ln any case, God needs no land.
Man does.

659
01:29:14,592 --> 01:29:18,619
Move temples or idols...
l want this piece of land.

660
01:29:20,130 --> 01:29:22,621
Just tell me its worth including
your share of brokerage.

661
01:29:29,673 --> 01:29:30,640
Are you in your senses?
Do you know what you're saying?

662
01:29:34,211 --> 01:29:36,236
Do you know who Shankar Singhania is?

663
01:29:40,084 --> 01:29:42,348
He's one the ten richest men
in lndia.

664
01:29:43,320 --> 01:29:47,017
The taxes he pays is equivalent
to Maharashtra's monthly budget.

665
01:29:47,925 --> 01:29:51,622
Without his support, no party in
Maharashtra can form a government.

666
01:29:52,830 --> 01:29:55,298
You talk about Maharashtra?
lf Singhania wishes...

667
01:29:55,466 --> 01:29:58,026
he can topple the government
at the centre in 24 hours.

668
01:29:59,803 --> 01:30:02,271
Do you how much he has
done for this state?

669
01:30:02,940 --> 01:30:05,704
He has built innumerable hospitals,
schools and colleges.

670
01:30:06,110 --> 01:30:08,305
He has done something
for every community.

671
01:30:08,679 --> 01:30:13,548
Which is why people worship him
the way they do.

672
01:30:14,818 --> 01:30:20,347
Forget people, sir. Even we go to
him, whenever we face a problem.

673
01:30:20,824 --> 01:30:22,985
And he helps us without
a second thought.

674
01:30:24,161 --> 01:30:25,753
Do you know what it means...

675
01:30:25,929 --> 01:30:28,625
to accuse such a man of being
involved with terrorists?

676
01:30:29,166 --> 01:30:31,760
People will laugh at us!
They'll say the cops have gone mad.

677
01:30:33,837 --> 01:30:35,896
lt'll ruin the image
of the police department.

678
01:30:36,240 --> 01:30:39,573
What glorious image does the
department enjoy right now anyway?

679
01:30:41,879 --> 01:30:44,211
Only those with respect
can be defamed.

680
01:30:45,215 --> 01:30:49,481
We know what the public has to say
about the police department.

681
01:30:50,688 --> 01:30:52,713
We don't enjoy a much better
reputation than the thugs.

682
01:30:53,891 --> 01:30:55,825
When someone picks
a poor man's pocket...

683
01:30:56,060 --> 01:30:58,654
and he goes to a police station
to file a complaint...

684
01:30:58,896 --> 01:31:01,763
he's treated as if he were
a criminal himself.

685
01:31:02,966 --> 01:31:05,366
When was your pocket picked?
What was the time then?

686
01:31:05,969 --> 01:31:08,563
What were you doing there?
How much money were you carrying?

687
01:31:08,972 --> 01:31:10,906
Where did you get so much
of money from?

688
01:31:11,508 --> 01:31:13,772
With silly questions like these,
you silence the poor man.

689
01:31:14,411 --> 01:31:17,346
He's then asked to go fetch some
cold drinks and some cigarettes too.

690
01:31:17,948 --> 01:31:20,815
The poor man has to leave.
As soon as he goes...

691
01:31:21,218 --> 01:31:24,119
the officers talk about the
pick-pockets in that area.

692
01:31:24,888 --> 01:31:26,822
Pandu? No, he's away
in his village

693
01:31:27,091 --> 01:31:29,423
lt must've been Raju.
And Raju is summoned...

694
01:31:29,693 --> 01:31:32,491
not to be arrested, but for
their share to be claimed from him.

695
01:31:32,963 --> 01:31:36,160
And that really does a lot for the
glorious image of our department.

696
01:31:37,601 --> 01:31:42,538
lf a poor man jumps a signal in
his hurry to reach the office...

697
01:31:42,773 --> 01:31:46,334
all hell breaks loose.
He's asked to produce his licence.

698
01:31:46,910 --> 01:31:51,176
ls the headlight working?
Enough air in the tyres? Gas?

699
01:31:52,282 --> 01:31:56,343
You question him as if he were
trying to cross the border.

700
01:31:57,054 --> 01:31:59,682
And this strictness is observed
not for the law...

701
01:31:59,890 --> 01:32:03,087
it's for one's own pocket. Whatever
one can manage to squeeze.

702
01:32:03,694 --> 01:32:07,221
And that really brings
glory to our department.

703
01:32:08,732 --> 01:32:13,431
Smugglers, pimps and gangsters
are welcomed in police stations.

704
01:32:13,971 --> 01:32:18,169
They are given chairs to sit on.
That does so much for our glory.

705
01:32:20,144 --> 01:32:23,841
Crime is increasing by the day.
And we are responsible for it.

706
01:32:24,948 --> 01:32:29,612
lf pick-pockets have turned killers,
we are responsible for that!

707
01:32:30,654 --> 01:32:34,488
Smugglers of narcotics
are now running guns...

708
01:32:34,691 --> 01:32:36,625
and we are responsible
for it!

709
01:32:37,127 --> 01:32:41,393
Brothel-keepers soon start
running the nation.

710
01:32:41,698 --> 01:32:43,632
And we are responsible for it!

711
01:32:47,438 --> 01:32:50,635
On the first day of every month,
we expect to be paid our salaries.

712
01:32:51,975 --> 01:32:54,637
But who pays us the money?
The Government?

713
01:32:55,679 --> 01:33:00,582
Ministers and public representatives?
No. lt's public money.

714
01:33:01,285 --> 01:33:04,880
The public we don't even
courteously talk to.

715
01:33:07,291 --> 01:33:10,488
To protect the nation, the public
has sent soldiers to our borders.

716
01:33:11,195 --> 01:33:13,129
And to safeguard society,
it has chosen us.

717
01:33:14,131 --> 01:33:17,794
The soldiers are doing their duty.
And now about us...?

718
01:33:19,536 --> 01:33:21,902
When our soldiers were being
martyred in Kargil...

719
01:33:22,105 --> 01:33:25,700
the nation wept.
But when a policeman dies...

720
01:33:25,976 --> 01:33:28,171
people actually feel happy.

721
01:33:29,012 --> 01:33:31,572
They say it's one corrupt man less.

722
01:33:35,752 --> 01:33:38,949
We must change the situation.
We must change our image.

723
01:33:39,289 --> 01:33:41,450
So people have a nice word
to say about us.

724
01:33:42,125 --> 01:33:44,719
And that isn't happening by
building temples...

725
01:33:44,928 --> 01:33:47,294
or inscribing lofty slogans
in police stations.

726
01:33:47,931 --> 01:33:49,694
We will have to act.

727
01:33:50,033 --> 01:33:52,297
We will have to show the criminals
the power of this uniform.

728
01:33:53,036 --> 01:33:57,302
Be he a pick-pocket or a richie-rich
like Shankar Singhania!

729
01:33:58,041 --> 01:34:00,407
Only then will the public feel
a sense of attachment with us.

730
01:34:00,677 --> 01:34:02,611
And they will truly respect us.

731
01:34:15,092 --> 01:34:16,957
What were you guys doing there?

732
01:34:17,227 --> 01:34:19,957
Why didn't you shoot Francis,
before he uttered Papa's name?

733
01:34:22,099 --> 01:34:27,162
Before dawn, l'm going to kill him.
He's going to die at my hands!

734
01:34:34,711 --> 01:34:39,273
No, Papa! How dare that ingrate
utter your name?

735
01:34:41,151 --> 01:34:44,416
The poor will often always
use rich men's names, my son.

736
01:34:47,157 --> 01:34:49,352
Everything will be all right.
Here's what you will do.

737
01:34:49,993 --> 01:34:51,984
Go to the farmhouse
with your friends.

738
01:35:00,771 --> 01:35:06,107
Look after my son.
Young blood. lt boils very quickly.

739
01:35:06,910 --> 01:35:08,343
Take care of him.

740
01:35:15,986 --> 01:35:18,978
Please take my advise.
Go abroad for a few days.

741
01:35:20,090 --> 01:35:23,025
Azad will have cooled down by then.
- Wrong.

742
01:35:25,228 --> 01:35:27,788
He has honesty running
in his veins.

743
01:35:29,266 --> 01:35:31,598
His heart beats for his country.

744
01:35:32,970 --> 01:35:34,904
He will never cool off.

745
01:35:35,772 --> 01:35:38,707
No matter which corner of
the world l hide in...

746
01:35:39,009 --> 01:35:44,003
Azad will not give up following me.
The law and the courts...

747
01:35:45,148 --> 01:35:49,448
l have no regard for them.
l only care for my son.

748
01:35:51,154 --> 01:35:54,715
Azad must not eye my son Sanjay.

749
01:35:56,493 --> 01:36:00,122
Which is why l must face him
and not try to escape from him.

750
01:36:02,499 --> 01:36:06,401
Here's what you will do.
Make an announcement that...

751
01:36:07,237 --> 01:36:09,797
l'm going to distribute clothes
and food-grains tomorrow morning.

752
01:36:11,208 --> 01:36:14,006
As soon as a crowd assembles
before my house...

753
01:36:14,411 --> 01:36:18,780
infiltrate the crowd with about
50 of your armed men.

754
01:36:20,250 --> 01:36:23,185
As soon as Azad tries
to arrest me and leave...

755
01:36:23,453 --> 01:36:28,254
finish him.
But remember...

756
01:36:28,558 --> 01:36:32,722
it must appear as if the mob has
lynched him in a fit of fury.

757
01:36:34,698 --> 01:36:38,065
The law will be helpless
after that.

758
01:36:40,137 --> 01:36:40,694
Because a mob has no face
and no name.

759
01:36:49,513 --> 01:36:52,710
You guys get it? You will be
part of the silent crowd.

760
01:36:53,417 --> 01:36:55,942
But if DCP Azad tries to
arrest Mr Singhania...

761
01:36:56,186 --> 01:36:58,450
attack him. Get it?
- Yes.

762
01:36:58,989 --> 01:37:02,720
The DCP is here, sir.
- Show him in.

763
01:37:08,098 --> 01:37:10,760
Welcome, Azad. Namaskar.

764
01:37:17,507 --> 01:37:19,441
l knew you would be coming.

765
01:37:19,943 --> 01:37:23,106
But l didn't expect you so soon.

766
01:37:24,514 --> 01:37:26,778
And l think my visit is overdue.

767
01:37:27,317 --> 01:37:29,251
l should've come here long ago.

768
01:37:31,855 --> 01:37:34,449
Azad, cooperate with me.

769
01:37:35,792 --> 01:37:38,693
Help me, and enjoy life.

770
01:37:40,363 --> 01:37:42,490
You must cooperate with me
by quietly leaving with me.

771
01:37:42,999 --> 01:37:46,491
As a guest of the government,
l'll take good care of you.

772
01:37:50,707 --> 01:37:54,302
Perhaps you don't know that
your senior officers...

773
01:37:54,578 --> 01:37:58,036
bow their heads when
they speak to me.

774
01:37:58,315 --> 01:38:02,251
And perhaps you don't know
that Raj Shekhar Azad...

775
01:38:02,519 --> 01:38:04,783
bows his head only to
the National Tricolour.

776
01:38:08,558 --> 01:38:11,254
Things like this are
better uttered...

777
01:38:11,661 --> 01:38:13,720
by recruits who've just
got their uniforms.

778
01:38:14,831 --> 01:38:18,494
You're a very senior officer.
You've been in the force for years.

779
01:38:19,970 --> 01:38:21,904
Please try to understand
what l'm saying.

780
01:38:24,074 --> 01:38:26,668
Be friends with me.
- The predator...

781
01:38:26,910 --> 01:38:29,174
does not befriend his prey.

782
01:38:32,048 --> 01:38:36,382
You will prey on Shankar Singhania?
You are inviting your own death!

783
01:38:36,686 --> 01:38:41,521
Don't you yell at me.
Or l'll lay you out flat right here.

784
01:39:00,844 --> 01:39:01,776
Move.

785
01:39:05,015 --> 01:39:06,949
Down! Down!

786
01:39:09,052 --> 01:39:12,510
Police Department,
Down Down!

787
01:39:14,591 --> 01:39:17,788
Police Department,
Down! Down!

788
01:39:38,648 --> 01:39:40,843
You're fond of playing the
predator, aren't you?

789
01:39:41,651 --> 01:39:43,778
What makes you stop?
Walk forth.

790
01:39:47,224 --> 01:39:49,419
lf someone as much as points
a finger at me...

791
01:39:49,693 --> 01:39:54,596
my followers don't spare him.
And you have handcuffed me.

792
01:39:55,365 --> 01:39:58,425
What will they do to you?
Think it over.

793
01:39:59,703 --> 01:40:01,466
Things haven't yet gotten
out of hand.

794
01:40:01,705 --> 01:40:05,106
Undo the handcuffs and apologise
to me in their presence.

795
01:40:05,976 --> 01:40:07,910
l'll reason with them
and calm them down.

796
01:40:08,712 --> 01:40:10,646
And you will be able
to go home.

797
01:40:10,947 --> 01:40:12,642
Set him free!

798
01:40:13,083 --> 01:40:15,643
Even if we die, we will not
let you take him away!

799
01:40:16,052 --> 01:40:19,988
He's our benefactor!
- Over our dead bodies, you take him!

800
01:40:20,423 --> 01:40:23,654
How dare you handcuff
an angel like him?

801
01:40:24,227 --> 01:40:26,127
Let him go! Or face
the consequences.

802
01:40:26,663 --> 01:40:30,030
Take another step, and
we'll pile the bodies here.

803
01:40:34,971 --> 01:40:38,907
Quietly go away from here and
let the law take its own course.

804
01:40:39,776 --> 01:40:41,710
Or else, l'll shoot
everyone of you.

805
01:40:42,012 --> 01:40:44,947
You talk big with a gun in hand?
Shoot, if you have the guts!

806
01:40:45,181 --> 01:40:50,448
Yes, shoot! For Mr Singhania,
we'd happily lay down our lives!

807
01:41:07,671 --> 01:41:10,697
You shoot without reason...?
You've killed 5 of my men!

808
01:41:11,508 --> 01:41:13,942
l'm not going to spare you! You'll
have to answer for what you've done!

809
01:41:15,845 --> 01:41:18,279
l won't do the answering.
They will.

810
01:41:27,791 --> 01:41:30,919
What are you staring for?
l've used your technique.

811
01:41:31,895 --> 01:41:35,888
You plant four dozen thugs
in a crowd of decent folks.

812
01:41:36,833 --> 01:41:41,099
And l plant five cops in
the same crowd... as thugs.

813
01:41:43,373 --> 01:41:49,278
This is tit for tat.
Get it? Move now.

814
01:41:56,987 --> 01:41:59,478
Your wife's problem isn't physical.
lt's psychological.

815
01:42:00,123 --> 01:42:02,557
Her father's death has
shocked her deeply.

816
01:42:03,093 --> 01:42:04,685
l've prescribed some medicines...

817
01:42:10,667 --> 01:42:12,567
Watch out tomorrow, Rahim.

818
01:42:13,837 --> 01:42:16,101
lt's very necessary for Francis to
be produced in court tomorrow.

819
01:42:22,846 --> 01:42:25,110
You've already forgotten my name?
Please sit down.

820
01:42:26,649 --> 01:42:28,583
The name is Rajshekhar Azad.

821
01:42:30,453 --> 01:42:33,786
What l say conveys a
thousand things, DCP.

822
01:42:35,291 --> 01:42:39,751
You will get to know that gradually.
- Really? And what's up...?

823
01:42:40,230 --> 01:42:42,755
You're looking a lot smarter
in these clothes today.

824
01:42:44,768 --> 01:42:46,668
There's a meaning behind that too.

825
01:42:47,003 --> 01:42:50,234
Whenever l solve a case,
l dress like this.

826
01:42:53,910 --> 01:42:57,073
Have you found the
DGP's killer then?

827
01:42:57,547 --> 01:42:59,174
Yes.

828
01:43:06,856 --> 01:43:08,790
You're the one who did it.

829
01:43:10,326 --> 01:43:12,760
You're the one the DGP last called
before he died.

830
01:43:14,898 --> 01:43:18,129
l found your cell-phone number
on his mobile phone.

831
01:43:19,402 --> 01:43:23,202
The bullets in his body had to do
with your service revolver.

832
01:43:24,774 --> 01:43:28,335
l had put together a lot
more evidence... l had.

833
01:43:31,014 --> 01:43:34,677
l've destroyed all the evidence.
For good.

834
01:43:38,221 --> 01:43:41,816
Because you didn't murder
the DGP Surya Pratap Singh.

835
01:43:43,359 --> 01:43:45,259
You have slain him.

836
01:43:45,929 --> 01:43:48,830
Just as Arjuna slayed the Kauravas
in the battle of Mahabharat.

837
01:43:50,733 --> 01:43:55,727
Arjuna set down his arms when
confronted by his own brethren...

838
01:43:55,939 --> 01:44:00,603
and Lord Krishna reasoned with him.
But in this battle...

839
01:44:00,877 --> 01:44:04,210
you are Arjuna and you are
Lord Krishna too.

840
01:44:08,685 --> 01:44:10,812
That is why l called you
Shri Krishna Arjun.

841
01:44:19,529 --> 01:44:22,862
That battle was between
the Pandavas and the Kauravas.

842
01:44:24,067 --> 01:44:27,662
ln this battle, there are
Kauravas all around...

843
01:44:27,937 --> 01:44:29,871
and you are all alone
among them.

844
01:44:30,473 --> 01:44:32,407
But you're still fighting
a lone battle.

845
01:44:33,343 --> 01:44:36,710
lf l can't fight with you
in this battle...

846
01:44:36,946 --> 01:44:39,210
l can at least help you.

847
01:44:55,999 --> 01:44:57,694
You killed my Papa?

848
01:45:04,207 --> 01:45:08,871
You have killed my Papa...
you have killed him!

849
01:45:09,179 --> 01:45:10,874
Listen to me, Anjali.

850
01:45:12,282 --> 01:45:14,216
l've been listening to you
all the while.

851
01:45:15,118 --> 01:45:20,055
Here l was, dying to know
who could have killed Papa.

852
01:45:21,391 --> 01:45:23,325
lt was you...

853
01:45:24,994 --> 01:45:28,896
Didn't your hands hesitate
to kill the man...

854
01:45:29,332 --> 01:45:31,664
who gave his daughter's hand
in yours?

855
01:45:32,335 --> 01:45:33,495
Listen, Anjali...

856
01:45:42,879 --> 01:45:44,813
Look, Anjali...
- Don't touch me.

857
01:45:46,015 --> 01:45:48,210
Not with those hands...
or l'll kill myself.

858
01:45:54,891 --> 01:45:59,351
l can't live with you another moment!
Not another moment!

859
01:46:26,022 --> 01:46:27,216
Namaskar.

860
01:46:31,394 --> 01:46:33,794
So Mr DCP Azad...

861
01:46:34,063 --> 01:46:37,863
you think Mr Shankar Singhania
is a terrorist?

862
01:46:39,869 --> 01:46:41,996
You think he's a
follower of Gandhi?

863
01:46:44,274 --> 01:46:47,004
You can't answer a question
with a question.

864
01:46:48,077 --> 01:46:51,342
No point in asking questions
you know answers for.

865
01:46:53,182 --> 01:46:58,745
Can you prove in court that
Mr Singhania has anything to do...

866
01:46:59,088 --> 01:47:01,818
with the terrorst Wasim Khan?
- l can prove...

867
01:47:02,025 --> 01:47:05,358
that Singhania has everything
to do with Wasim Khan.

868
01:47:05,762 --> 01:47:07,957
Really? How many witnesses have you
bought over to prove that?

869
01:47:09,966 --> 01:47:13,163
lt's for pimps of the law like you
to buy and sell witnesses.

870
01:47:13,503 --> 01:47:15,437
Watch your tongue when you
answer me, DCP.

871
01:47:15,672 --> 01:47:18,334
And remember what you're asking
before questioning me, lawyer.

872
01:47:23,546 --> 01:47:26,481
Defence, ask questions only related
to this case.

873
01:47:29,185 --> 01:47:33,019
l want to question his
witnesses, Your Honour.

874
01:47:37,527 --> 01:47:39,688
My witness will be produced
anytime now.

875
01:47:40,129 --> 01:47:41,289
l need a little time.

876
01:47:52,809 --> 01:47:53,741
Where are they?

877
01:47:59,615 --> 01:48:02,015
l looked for them...
there's no one there.

878
01:48:02,318 --> 01:48:04,013
What?

879
01:48:13,029 --> 01:48:17,432
Your Honour, l already told you that
we were wasting the court's time.

880
01:48:18,568 --> 01:48:20,661
There's no point in
waiting for anyone.

881
01:48:21,137 --> 01:48:25,801
DCP Azad cannot produce any witness.
Because he has no witnesses.

882
01:48:26,142 --> 01:48:28,007
Mr Azad, what do you
have to say?

883
01:48:37,620 --> 01:48:40,748
This Court honourably
acquits Mr Singhania...

884
01:48:41,157 --> 01:48:44,752
and warns the police department
that unless they have...

885
01:48:44,994 --> 01:48:47,087
tangible evidence and
witnesses...

886
01:48:47,363 --> 01:48:50,799
they are not supposed to harass
respectable citizens.

887
01:49:01,878 --> 01:49:03,277
Congratulations, Mr Singhania.

888
01:49:03,880 --> 01:49:05,575
You were amazing.

889
01:49:20,196 --> 01:49:22,664
Well, DCP Azad?
You're very angry, aren't you?

890
01:49:24,100 --> 01:49:27,763
This is what happens to people
who get carried away.

891
01:49:31,207 --> 01:49:34,142
You tried to prove my links
with Wasim Khan, didn't you?

892
01:49:35,211 --> 01:49:38,942
Take it from me.
l do have links with him.

893
01:49:41,050 --> 01:49:44,952
Not you, and not the entire
police department can prove it.

894
01:49:49,826 --> 01:49:51,760
Your witness didn't
make it to the court.

895
01:49:52,662 --> 01:49:54,562
That's because l prevented him
from getting here.

896
01:49:55,264 --> 01:49:57,164
And what would you have achieved
even if he had arrived here?

897
01:49:57,667 --> 01:49:59,567
l'd have bought out thatjudge.

898
01:50:00,403 --> 01:50:02,303
Everything in this country
is up for sale.

899
01:50:03,005 --> 01:50:05,166
One only has to pay
the right price.

900
01:50:06,275 --> 01:50:10,177
Make friends with me,
and you will have your price.

901
01:50:11,347 --> 01:50:14,783
And if you chose to be my enemy,
you must pay for it.

902
01:50:16,285 --> 01:50:21,348
You want to pay or collect...?
That's for you to decide.

903
01:51:04,433 --> 01:51:06,230
How much did you sell out for?

904
01:51:06,569 --> 01:51:08,628
What price-tag have you put
on the trust l placed in you?

905
01:51:09,272 --> 01:51:11,206
l'll tell you, sir.

906
01:51:16,712 --> 01:51:20,648
Save my children...
Please save my children.

907
01:51:21,450 --> 01:51:23,384
What happened?
- What happened to your children?

908
01:51:23,653 --> 01:51:26,588
Sanjay Singhania has
kidnapped my children.

909
01:51:27,323 --> 01:51:29,587
He says you're holding one of
his men in your custody.

910
01:51:30,326 --> 01:51:34,262
lf you don't let him go,
they'll kill my children.

911
01:51:35,798 --> 01:51:38,961
l want my children...
Please let that man go.

912
01:51:39,535 --> 01:51:42,436
No, we can't let him go.

913
01:51:43,372 --> 01:51:48,309
No... You can't do that!
Please help me!

914
01:51:49,178 --> 01:51:50,839
My children...

915
01:51:51,380 --> 01:51:54,315
l beg of you!

916
01:51:56,852 --> 01:51:59,787
Please! Please save my children!

917
01:52:04,927 --> 01:52:06,792
Manoj, let him go.

918
01:52:14,270 --> 01:52:16,101
Let's go.

919
01:52:23,379 --> 01:52:25,813
Look, l've brought your man
with me.

920
01:52:26,515 --> 01:52:31,316
You promised to set my children free,
if l brought him along.

921
01:52:33,255 --> 01:52:35,189
Please let my children go now.

922
01:52:37,727 --> 01:52:39,661
Let them go.

923
01:52:55,244 --> 01:52:57,178
You will testify against my Papa?

924
01:53:15,865 --> 01:53:18,925
Sir, your duty must be
all-important for you.

925
01:53:19,769 --> 01:53:23,364
But for them, you are as
important as their duty.

926
01:53:24,306 --> 01:53:26,240
Your family is important too.

927
01:53:28,044 --> 01:53:31,241
Do not think you've
lost the battle...

928
01:53:31,447 --> 01:53:33,381
because one witness could
not be presented in court.

929
01:53:33,983 --> 01:53:35,712
That's impossible.

930
01:53:36,052 --> 01:53:39,385
You have waged this war against
the enemies of the nation.

931
01:53:40,456 --> 01:53:43,857
l swear by the Almighty.
You will win this battle, sir.

932
01:53:45,995 --> 01:53:50,125
And the day you return
successful...

933
01:53:50,499 --> 01:53:55,402
you will feel the need for
your wife and children.

934
01:53:56,505 --> 01:54:03,172
For what is success, if you have
no one to share it with?

935
01:54:06,115 --> 01:54:10,916
They're happy to have saved
the lives of your children.

936
01:54:12,188 --> 01:54:14,520
What they regret more...

937
01:54:14,790 --> 01:54:18,385
is that they could not keep
the promise they made to you.

938
01:54:19,462 --> 01:54:23,899
So they're leaving the
city for good today.

939
01:54:32,341 --> 01:54:34,434
lt's mine...
- No! lt's mine!

940
01:54:51,861 --> 01:54:53,795
A kiss for me!

941
01:54:55,698 --> 01:54:57,131
Go on.

942
01:55:06,308 --> 01:55:08,435
Don't utter my name.
And please go away!

943
01:55:10,846 --> 01:55:17,581
lf you want me and my children
to live in peace,...

944
01:55:17,820 --> 01:55:20,152
please don't set foot
in this house again.

945
01:55:27,897 --> 01:55:29,797
l want a divorce.

946
01:55:30,766 --> 01:55:32,666
As soon as possible.

947
01:55:49,285 --> 01:55:51,219
Brother, you always blame me.

948
01:55:51,453 --> 01:55:53,512
He always comes home late.
You say nothing to him.

949
01:55:53,789 --> 01:55:58,249
He's in police service.
Late-coming is part of it.

950
01:56:00,696 --> 01:56:04,792
Mr Azad, is it a rule that cops
go home late every night?

951
01:56:05,568 --> 01:56:08,469
There is a rule! He's right.
- Don't look at him!

952
01:56:08,737 --> 01:56:11,205
Know what? Before marriage,
when l called him at 5 p.m....

953
01:56:11,473 --> 01:56:14,306
he used to turn up at 4!
- l...? Lies!

954
01:56:14,577 --> 01:56:16,511
She used to land up at every
training centre l went to.

955
01:56:16,679 --> 01:56:18,840
She used to go around in circles.

956
01:56:19,582 --> 01:56:21,243
l...?
- Was it l?

957
01:56:21,450 --> 01:56:23,475
l...?
- l...?

958
01:57:02,491 --> 01:57:05,483
l wasn't crazy...

959
01:57:06,028 --> 01:57:08,496
Crazy, l went

960
01:57:09,465 --> 01:57:15,370
l don't know when and how
this love-story happened

961
01:57:15,938 --> 01:57:18,873
You know nothing,
l know not too...

962
01:57:19,208 --> 01:57:21,574
when your heart met mine

963
01:57:22,211 --> 01:57:25,078
Crazy, l went

964
01:57:25,748 --> 01:57:28,581
Crazy, l went

965
01:57:36,859 --> 01:57:39,726
Crazy, you weren't

966
01:57:40,195 --> 01:57:42,891
Crazy, you went

967
01:57:43,599 --> 01:57:49,560
l know nothing when and how
this love-story happened

968
01:58:10,960 --> 01:58:17,024
Your gaze has had an impact
on me, my love

969
01:58:28,243 --> 01:58:33,943
Your crazy heart
has made a promise to mine

970
01:58:34,416 --> 01:58:37,214
l agree, my love...

971
01:58:37,686 --> 01:58:39,950
l did what my heart drove me to

972
01:59:29,605 --> 01:59:35,669
My heart understands
what your heart beats for

973
01:59:46,755 --> 01:59:52,694
When you're with me...
why mustn't l have desires?

974
01:59:53,062 --> 01:59:55,690
Without you, l won't
live a moment...

975
01:59:56,131 --> 01:59:58,691
l have decided

976
01:59:59,368 --> 02:00:02,201
Crazy, l have gone

977
02:00:02,738 --> 02:00:06,071
Crazy, l have gone

978
02:00:07,142 --> 02:00:09,736
Crazy, l wasn't

979
02:00:10,312 --> 02:00:13,076
Crazy, l went

980
02:00:13,882 --> 02:00:19,752
When and how did this
love-story happen?

981
02:00:20,422 --> 02:00:23,414
You know not.
Neither do l...

982
02:00:23,692 --> 02:00:25,956
when your heart met mine

983
02:01:16,211 --> 02:01:18,145
You're worried for no reason.

984
02:01:18,447 --> 02:01:20,813
lt enhances the status of courts
when people like me visit them.

985
02:01:22,217 --> 02:01:26,347
Besides, court mean trouble
to the poor. Not for the rich.

986
02:01:28,423 --> 02:01:32,154
Will you let Azad go scotfree then?
He had arrested and insulted you.

987
02:01:32,895 --> 02:01:34,829
That's just why l must
teach him a lesson.

988
02:01:35,464 --> 02:01:39,230
A police officer must think ten times
before he thinks of arresting me.

989
02:01:39,935 --> 02:01:41,061
Besides...

990
02:01:53,382 --> 02:01:55,873
You wound a tiger and have the
audacity to walk into his den.

991
02:01:56,952 --> 02:01:59,147
l didn't know you're such
a stupid man, Azad.

992
02:01:59,421 --> 02:02:01,821
You're the stupid one for not
realising that the one...

993
02:02:02,057 --> 02:02:05,993
who puts his hand in the snake-pit,
knows to unfang it too.

994
02:02:07,129 --> 02:02:09,962
That we'll see, DCP.

995
02:02:11,200 --> 02:02:13,828
l'll carve your body into
so many small pieces...

996
02:02:14,269 --> 02:02:17,864
that for generations to come in
your family, they'll talk about it.

997
02:02:19,074 --> 02:02:23,773
Forget my body. Think of your son,
who has to light your funeral pyre.

998
02:02:25,280 --> 02:02:27,612
What do you mean?
- Up there.

999
02:02:33,288 --> 02:02:35,882
Nothing will happen to you, my son!
Nothing!

1000
02:02:39,027 --> 02:02:40,961
Don't be afraid.
Nothing will happen to you.

1001
02:02:42,698 --> 02:02:44,427
Have you guys gone mad?
Put those guns away!

1002
02:02:44,700 --> 02:02:48,568
This enmity's between you and me.
My son has done nothing. Let him go!

1003
02:02:50,272 --> 02:02:51,603
My son...

1004
02:02:53,141 --> 02:02:55,075
Well? Deflated already...?

1005
02:02:56,345 --> 02:02:58,108
Let him go.

1006
02:03:02,951 --> 02:03:06,352
Know what? l'm not going to
kill you right yet either.

1007
02:03:07,055 --> 02:03:10,752
Because l've got to prove that
you're a traitor of the nation.

1008
02:03:11,693 --> 02:03:16,892
The day l have proved that,
l will not arrest you...

1009
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:19,900
l will kill you.

1010
02:03:34,149 --> 02:03:37,812
Who were those four boys?
From which police station?

1011
02:03:38,120 --> 02:03:40,281
They aren't from the
police department, sir.

1012
02:03:41,189 --> 02:03:43,953
So?
- lt's like this, sir.

1013
02:03:44,426 --> 02:03:47,918
Azad does not trust any officer
in the police department.

1014
02:03:48,697 --> 02:03:50,961
Which is why he has kept those
four boys under his own care.

1015
02:03:51,733 --> 02:03:56,193
He's personally training them.
Soon, he'll give them police uniforms.

1016
02:03:57,172 --> 02:04:00,369
lt's those four boys he had
entrusted Francis to.

1017
02:04:02,444 --> 02:04:03,536
You ought to have killed the
four of them with Francis.

1018
02:04:07,883 --> 02:04:09,646
You ought to have finished them.

1019
02:04:24,633 --> 02:04:27,067
Just because the DCP shows
some favours to you...

1020
02:04:27,402 --> 02:04:30,166
you guys think you have
turned DCPs?

1021
02:04:30,972 --> 02:04:32,940
You hold a gun to me?

1022
02:04:33,575 --> 02:04:35,805
You were terribly excited,
weren't you?

1023
02:04:36,878 --> 02:04:41,975
Spirited guys, aren't you?
l'll exorcise you guys today!

1024
02:04:44,953 --> 02:04:50,118
lf l don't have your DCP Azad
as my slave, l won't be Sanjay...

1025
02:04:59,134 --> 02:05:01,967
You abuse him...?
l won't spare you!

1026
02:05:07,075 --> 02:05:09,009
DCP's sidekick!

1027
02:05:26,094 --> 02:05:27,356
Finish him!

1028
02:08:07,522 --> 02:08:09,456
He...

1029
02:08:22,237 --> 02:08:24,797
Nothing's going to happen to you!
Nothing.

1030
02:08:25,240 --> 02:08:27,140
You're going to be all right!

1031
02:08:34,449 --> 02:08:39,045
May no more injuries be inflicted

1032
02:08:39,588 --> 02:08:41,988
l pray...

1033
02:08:42,324 --> 02:08:47,193
that my lndia lives on

1034
02:08:48,263 --> 02:08:55,362
My life l sacrifice, my friends

1035
02:08:56,204 --> 02:09:00,971
So that my lndia lives on

1036
02:09:08,249 --> 02:09:10,513
Recognise me, DCP Azad?

1037
02:09:12,654 --> 02:09:15,589
You announce the war.
And l set it rolling.

1038
02:09:17,125 --> 02:09:19,184
Those four guys are said to be
very loyal to you.

1039
02:09:20,595 --> 02:09:23,860
And that you're soon going to
give them police uniforms too.

1040
02:09:25,133 --> 02:09:27,192
l thought l should be doing
something for them, too.

1041
02:09:28,303 --> 02:09:31,795
l decided to give them a promotion
and dispatch them to hell.

1042
02:09:33,308 --> 02:09:37,244
One of them has been promoted.
The rest of them will be too.

1043
02:09:39,714 --> 02:09:43,650
l know you're very sad right now.
But who can fight the inevitable.

1044
02:09:44,319 --> 02:09:48,255
lt's all a matter of destiny.
Death does not change its course.

1045
02:09:49,224 --> 02:09:51,692
Anyone who cross its path,
gets sucked in.

1046
02:09:53,328 --> 02:09:57,264
l target someone, and it's
someone else who dies.

1047
02:09:58,333 --> 02:10:02,997
Things good and bad...
are all in the Almighty's hands.

1048
02:10:03,938 --> 02:10:05,838
Praise the Lord.

1049
02:10:24,726 --> 02:10:26,660
l was the one who called you, sir.
- Who are you?

1050
02:10:26,895 --> 02:10:29,329
Deepak Sharma. l own this complex, sir.
- Let's go.

1051
02:10:32,567 --> 02:10:34,501
Have you received
terrorist threats earlier?

1052
02:10:34,836 --> 02:10:40,035
No, sir. Never. But l've just seen
someone running across with a bomb.

1053
02:10:40,442 --> 02:10:42,342
lt could've been a terrorist.
- Can you identify him?

1054
02:10:42,610 --> 02:10:46,376
Yes, sir. He wore an army-green
jacket and a black cap.

1055
02:11:19,981 --> 02:11:22,541
ls that him?
- Yes, that's him.

1056
02:11:35,864 --> 02:11:37,354
Welcome, Mr Singhania.

1057
02:11:41,836 --> 02:11:43,736
Bless you.

1058
02:11:50,445 --> 02:11:52,413
Your son isn't around?
- He should have been here by now.

1059
02:11:55,617 --> 02:11:56,845
Azad, what's up?

1060
02:11:59,521 --> 02:12:00,988
Please come in, sir.
- What happened?

1061
02:12:02,457 --> 02:12:05,858
The guy who ran inside is a terrorist.
He's hiding a bomb in his jacket.

1062
02:12:07,796 --> 02:12:11,892
l'll summon the bomb-squad.
- No. lt'll cause a stampede here.

1063
02:12:12,467 --> 02:12:13,934
Leave it to me. l'll get him.

1064
02:13:50,565 --> 02:13:52,226
Sanjay! My son!

1065
02:13:52,700 --> 02:13:54,634
Someone send for an ambulance!

1066
02:14:12,553 --> 02:14:14,817
How are we going to deal
with this case, sir?

1067
02:14:16,791 --> 02:14:19,988
The accident occurred in an effort
to save thousands of lives.

1068
02:14:21,562 --> 02:14:24,292
Bury the case with a
note of cross-firing.

1069
02:14:28,503 --> 02:14:30,903
The terrorist has run away, sir.
There's no danger anymore.

1070
02:14:39,614 --> 02:14:43,550
l know you're very sad right now.
But who can avert the inevitable?

1071
02:14:44,285 --> 02:14:46,219
lt has to do with destiny, you know.

1072
02:14:46,688 --> 02:14:48,349
Death does not change its course.

1073
02:14:48,623 --> 02:14:50,887
Anybody who comes in its path,
gets killed.

1074
02:14:51,626 --> 02:14:55,153
We target someone,
and yet someone dies.

1075
02:14:56,631 --> 02:15:01,500
Things good and bad are in our own
hands Mr Singhania. Not in the Lord's.

1076
02:15:02,603 --> 02:15:06,403
And a good police officer know
how to take advantage...

1077
02:15:06,607 --> 02:15:09,337
of notjust the law but also
the loopholes in the law.

1078
02:15:10,745 --> 02:15:12,440
Get that?

1079
02:15:24,692 --> 02:15:26,626
Pratap, you were amazing.

1080
02:15:28,563 --> 02:15:30,497
For sir, l could even
lay down my life.

1081
02:15:31,366 --> 02:15:33,300
l am what l am,
only because of him.

1082
02:15:34,435 --> 02:15:37,893
l wanted to become an engineer.
But l didn't have the money.

1083
02:15:39,140 --> 02:15:41,301
l once committed a theft in
frustration, and was caught.

1084
02:15:42,744 --> 02:15:46,111
Had l been sentenced to prison then,
l would have become a criminal too.

1085
02:15:51,619 --> 02:15:58,286
But sir made me see reason.
He lent me support and help.

1086
02:15:59,761 --> 02:16:01,285
And today, l'm an engineer
in M-Tech.

1087
02:16:04,599 --> 02:16:08,057
Thanks, Pratap. You have helped me
kill a criminal today.

1088
02:16:09,303 --> 02:16:11,430
What punishment the law ought to have
given Shankar Singhania's son...

1089
02:16:12,573 --> 02:16:14,507
l gave him today.

1090
02:16:16,277 --> 02:16:19,542
Take care of yourself, Pratap.
- Sure, sir.

1091
02:16:22,884 --> 02:16:24,784
Everything okay, uncle?

1092
02:16:29,357 --> 02:16:31,052
Things okay l hope?

1093
02:16:57,685 --> 02:16:59,516
What's up?
- Where is Pratap?

1094
02:16:59,687 --> 02:17:01,552
What do you want?
- Who are you?

1095
02:17:01,789 --> 02:17:03,723
Pratap Sinha's an engineer.
l'm his father.

1096
02:17:04,025 --> 02:17:05,959
Your son is no engineer.
He's a terrorist.

1097
02:17:06,627 --> 02:17:09,562
My son is an engineer.
He's not a terrorist.

1098
02:17:09,864 --> 02:17:11,456
Old fossil!

1099
02:17:13,301 --> 02:17:16,236
Masquearading as an engineer...?
Terrorist! Whom do you work for?

1100
02:17:16,571 --> 02:17:18,664
Whom do you work for? Tell me!
- Please let my son go!

1101
02:17:18,906 --> 02:17:20,737
He's not a terrorist.
He's an engineer.

1102
02:17:20,975 --> 02:17:22,567
You are surely mistaken.

1103
02:17:23,177 --> 02:17:26,510
You hit my mother! l won't spare you...
- Get him! Don't let him escape.

1104
02:17:32,019 --> 02:17:35,955
Where do you plan to trigger off
blasts in the city? Tell me!

1105
02:17:37,492 --> 02:17:41,485
l know who you're working for!
l'm destroy him too!

1106
02:17:45,867 --> 02:17:48,358
Let me go! Leave me alone!

1107
02:17:48,703 --> 02:17:50,637
You attack a policeman!

1108
02:17:54,208 --> 02:17:57,609
Let my son go! Spare him!

1109
02:18:02,683 --> 02:18:04,947
Don't hit him.
For God's sake!

1110
02:18:37,318 --> 02:18:39,377
l think you haven't
recognised him.

1111
02:18:40,488 --> 02:18:43,685
He's the terrorist at the wedding
with explosives on his person.

1112
02:18:44,258 --> 02:18:47,489
He's the one you were following.
Don't you remember?

1113
02:18:49,096 --> 02:18:51,030
You have a poor memory.

1114
02:18:52,767 --> 02:18:55,031
This is video recording
of the wedding.

1115
02:18:57,505 --> 02:18:59,700
lt's all recorded in this.

1116
02:19:07,014 --> 02:19:09,642
You used this man to kill my son.

1117
02:19:11,752 --> 02:19:14,687
You have caused me a lot of agony.
You have made me weep.

1118
02:19:16,157 --> 02:19:20,150
l'll use him now to torture you.
To make you cry.

1119
02:19:20,828 --> 02:19:25,197
Why you alone? l'll make his
parents and his fiance cry too.

1120
02:19:26,500 --> 02:19:28,468
l'll make you all
shed tears of blood.

1121
02:19:31,672 --> 02:19:34,505
You proved at the wedding the other
day that this man is a terrorist.

1122
02:19:35,676 --> 02:19:38,338
And he will now admit
that you are his friend.

1123
02:19:39,547 --> 02:19:43,711
And what can save you is
your surrender to the law.

1124
02:19:44,619 --> 02:19:46,519
And go behind bars.

1125
02:19:47,154 --> 02:19:49,315
Once you're imprisoned...

1126
02:19:49,624 --> 02:19:51,888
no one can prevent Wasim Khan
from coming out of prison.

1127
02:19:53,160 --> 02:19:56,561
You know how to take advantage of
the loopholes in the law, don't you?

1128
02:19:57,398 --> 02:20:00,731
Now take advantage.
Use your brains.

1129
02:20:01,836 --> 02:20:03,770
Take him along.

1130
02:20:07,575 --> 02:20:08,735
Move!

1131
02:20:36,904 --> 02:20:38,804
Forgive me, Mummy.

1132
02:21:13,007 --> 02:21:15,805
Anjali, l know l've given you
nothing but trouble.

1133
02:21:16,877 --> 02:21:19,971
l gave you no happiness orjoy...
nothing.

1134
02:21:22,316 --> 02:21:27,185
You're right. Maybe you will find
happiness, staying away from me.

1135
02:21:27,922 --> 02:21:29,856
Maybe the smile will
return to your face.

1136
02:21:31,926 --> 02:21:35,259
l have signed the divorce papers.

1137
02:21:51,278 --> 02:21:54,213
Rani, take the children upstairs.
- Let's go.

1138
02:21:57,985 --> 02:22:02,854
What's all this, Anjali?
Tell me! What's all this about?

1139
02:22:04,925 --> 02:22:05,857
Divorce.

1140
02:22:07,661 --> 02:22:10,858
l've taken a divorce, Mummy.
l was the one who asked for it.

1141
02:22:13,267 --> 02:22:17,533
Do you know? This is the man
who killed my Papa.

1142
02:22:20,841 --> 02:22:26,871
He's the one who has
killed your husband!

1143
02:22:28,716 --> 02:22:30,616
l can't live with such a man!

1144
02:22:31,218 --> 02:22:33,812
l'll never wear this matrimonial
necklace he gave me either!

1145
02:22:33,988 --> 02:22:34,886
Never!

1146
02:22:36,056 --> 02:22:39,253
Shut up! Have you gone mad...?

1147
02:22:41,996 --> 02:22:43,930
What did you say...?
What?

1148
02:22:45,332 --> 02:22:48,426
You take such a big decision without
even thinking about everything?

1149
02:22:49,503 --> 02:22:51,437
You're out to break the matrimonial
necklace around your neck?

1150
02:22:53,507 --> 02:22:54,940
For your Papa...?

1151
02:22:56,177 --> 02:22:58,111
You love your Papa
very much, don't you?

1152
02:22:59,313 --> 02:23:01,873
His death has been a
severe shock for you, isn't it?

1153
02:23:06,053 --> 02:23:08,920
But you don't know what
your Papa really was.

1154
02:23:10,891 --> 02:23:12,882
Do you want to know
the truth about him?

1155
02:23:16,997 --> 02:23:21,525
Mr Singh, l think it's impossible
to have Wasim Khan released.

1156
02:23:22,470 --> 02:23:26,406
Your son-in-law, DCP Azad
isn't going to listen to anyone.

1157
02:23:29,677 --> 02:23:34,205
l'm his father-in-law and
a senior in status too.

1158
02:23:39,920 --> 02:23:43,981
And l am the Director
General of Police.

1159
02:23:46,193 --> 02:23:50,357
Just get on with your
arrangements for Wasim Khan.

1160
02:23:54,134 --> 02:23:56,500
Here's half a million dollars
for you.

1161
02:24:16,056 --> 02:24:18,991
ls this what you have stooped to,
for the sake of money?

1162
02:24:20,060 --> 02:24:23,791
Our son-in-law has staked his life
to nab Wasim Khan.

1163
02:24:24,198 --> 02:24:27,656
And you accept money from
these people to let him off?

1164
02:24:29,403 --> 02:24:31,496
Azad will never listen to you.

1165
02:24:36,076 --> 02:24:41,013
You know very well. Surya Pratap
Singh treads the path he makes.

1166
02:24:42,116 --> 02:24:46,553
Anyone who crosses his path...
ends up losing his life.

1167
02:24:47,521 --> 02:24:51,890
lf my son-in-law proves to be
an obstacle in my path...

1168
02:24:52,126 --> 02:24:54,458
he'll die too.

1169
02:24:55,629 --> 02:24:58,291
For money, your Papa
could have done anything.

1170
02:25:00,067 --> 02:25:02,627
Even her son's husband
meant nothing to him.

1171
02:25:06,340 --> 02:25:10,333
But look at your husband, my dear.

1172
02:25:12,112 --> 02:25:15,604
For the sake of your happiness,
he has signed the divorce papers.

1173
02:25:16,850 --> 02:25:19,284
He didn't even think what
he would himself go through.

1174
02:25:24,458 --> 02:25:29,862
Even if Azad is hanged for
killing your Papa...

1175
02:25:30,130 --> 02:25:32,860
he will suffer for a few moments.

1176
02:25:34,935 --> 02:25:38,894
But you have given him such
a punishment...

1177
02:25:39,239 --> 02:25:44,074
that he will suffer for you
and your children all his life.

1178
02:25:45,145 --> 02:25:49,514
You have made a very big
mistake, Anjali. A very...

1179
02:26:13,140 --> 02:26:16,337
Son, you know Pratap
is not a terrorist.

1180
02:26:16,877 --> 02:26:19,072
You know my son is not
a terrorist.

1181
02:26:20,681 --> 02:26:24,082
So why did the police arrest him?
They beat him up mercilessly.

1182
02:26:28,188 --> 02:26:32,557
l did all l could to make him talk.
But he's not willing to say a word.

1183
02:26:33,360 --> 02:26:36,295
l just don't know
what to do.

1184
02:26:53,747 --> 02:26:56,648
You said Pratap is a very
capable boy, didn't you?

1185
02:26:58,252 --> 02:27:03,519
Because l trusted you, l decided
to get my sister married to him.

1186
02:27:04,925 --> 02:27:07,894
And you let us down...?
ln such a way?

1187
02:27:08,262 --> 02:27:12,824
You have ruined my sister's life!
Why did you do this? Why...?

1188
02:27:38,258 --> 02:27:44,163
Sir, l haven't told them anything.
They did their best...

1189
02:27:45,566 --> 02:27:50,401
they tortured me so much.
But l didn't open my mouth.

1190
02:27:53,107 --> 02:27:58,170
You need not worry, sir.
l'll never tell them your name.

1191
02:27:59,646 --> 02:28:03,104
Even if l have to die.
- No, Pratap. You must live.

1192
02:28:04,284 --> 02:28:06,343
Your family needs you.

1193
02:28:08,122 --> 02:28:10,147
And this country needs you, sir.

1194
02:28:12,559 --> 02:28:14,754
No, Pratap. This is too much.

1195
02:28:15,996 --> 02:28:18,157
l can't let you die
because of my obstinacy.

1196
02:28:19,633 --> 02:28:21,567
l'll tell them the whole truth.

1197
02:28:21,802 --> 02:28:24,168
And you must tell them
how l used you.

1198
02:28:24,772 --> 02:28:27,570
l'm the real culprit.
Everything will be all right.

1199
02:28:28,575 --> 02:28:30,270
They'll let you go.

1200
02:28:41,288 --> 02:28:43,552
l can't even see you
shedding tears, sir.

1201
02:28:44,625 --> 02:28:46,889
So how can l ever see you handcuffed?

1202
02:28:48,295 --> 02:28:51,958
lf your enemies are trying to
get back at you by using me...

1203
02:28:52,299 --> 02:28:57,032
l won't let them succeed. Never.
l won't let you lose, sir.

1204
02:28:58,038 --> 02:29:01,701
You must win.
You must win, sir!

1205
02:29:04,244 --> 02:29:06,178
You must win!

1206
02:29:08,081 --> 02:29:14,509
l lay down my life,
O friends...

1207
02:29:15,622 --> 02:29:20,559
so that my lndia my live on

1208
02:29:23,297 --> 02:29:28,132
May l live, may l die,
for this nation...

1209
02:29:28,635 --> 02:29:35,234
so that there is
happiness here forever

1210
02:29:43,750 --> 02:29:47,242
By committing suicide, that boy
has ruined all my plans.

1211
02:29:48,355 --> 02:29:53,292
l thought l'd use him to have
Azad dismissed from service.

1212
02:29:54,761 --> 02:29:57,093
And that l'd have Wasim Khan
released after that.

1213
02:29:57,364 --> 02:29:59,127
But everything has been ruined.

1214
02:30:00,367 --> 02:30:04,098
Azad will now try to hit back
like a wounded lion.

1215
02:30:04,538 --> 02:30:09,635
Before he gets to me, l must
leave this nation with Wasim Khan.

1216
02:30:09,977 --> 02:30:11,911
How's that possible, sir?

1217
02:30:12,379 --> 02:30:14,643
You don't know how stubborn
Shankar Singhania can be.

1218
02:30:15,415 --> 02:30:17,315
l'll drive the government to it.

1219
02:30:17,851 --> 02:30:21,150
The police will themselves
bring Wasim Khan to my house.

1220
02:30:43,110 --> 02:30:45,908
Enough! l will listen
to no more excuses.

1221
02:30:46,780 --> 02:30:49,214
Release Wasim Khan
within an hour...

1222
02:30:49,483 --> 02:30:51,951
and make arrangements for us
to leave the country.

1223
02:30:52,486 --> 02:30:57,822
lf your government does not oblige...
l will blow up Mumbai by 5 p.m.

1224
02:31:13,974 --> 02:31:15,373
Calm down, please...

1225
02:31:20,914 --> 02:31:24,179
When we can release 3 terrorists to
save a hundred hijacked passengers...

1226
02:31:24,484 --> 02:31:28,113
can't we release a single terrorist
to save thousands of innocent lives?

1227
02:31:41,501 --> 02:31:45,437
Don't let anyone in. Not even if
it's a very senior officer, okay?

1228
02:32:23,977 --> 02:32:28,243
See, Azad? Your own people
take such good care of me!

1229
02:32:29,282 --> 02:32:31,443
They can do anything for me.
Anything.

1230
02:32:33,887 --> 02:32:37,983
Look at the irony. You will personally
escort me out of this place today.

1231
02:32:40,894 --> 02:32:43,488
You admire my might now,
don't you?

1232
02:32:44,064 --> 02:32:49,161
And remember. The day
will soon be here...

1233
02:32:49,569 --> 02:32:54,233
when neither will this country
be free, nor will you exist.

1234
02:33:00,680 --> 02:33:04,912
Your turn to listen now.
Whether l live or not...

1235
02:33:05,218 --> 02:33:09,484
my country has always been free,
and free, it shall always be!

1236
02:33:13,560 --> 02:33:16,961
Do you know why're you still alive?
l wanted to prove...

1237
02:33:17,164 --> 02:33:19,496
that Shankar Singhania is an
agent to the likes of you.

1238
02:33:20,233 --> 02:33:23,862
By compelling the government to
release you, he has himself proved...

1239
02:33:24,104 --> 02:33:27,835
that he is a traitor of the country.
l no longer need you now.

1240
02:35:43,443 --> 02:35:47,379
Be friends with friends...

1241
02:35:48,014 --> 02:35:52,610
Treat enemies like
you should treat enemies

1242
02:35:53,386 --> 02:35:57,789
What's the life of a coward?

1243
02:35:58,725 --> 02:36:02,923
You owe it to this country,
your motherland

1244
02:36:14,474 --> 02:36:18,808
This country you must
never break

1245
02:36:19,412 --> 02:36:23,940
Enemies of the nation,
you must never spare

1246
02:36:24,718 --> 02:36:29,155
You must live for the country

1247
02:36:29,723 --> 02:36:34,660
For peace in the country

1248
02:36:42,736 --> 02:36:45,500
l pray...

1249
02:36:45,739 --> 02:36:50,676
so that my lndia
lives on forever

1250
02:36:59,786 --> 02:37:03,620
We worship Gandhiji. And we
also revere Chandrashekhar Azad.

1251
02:37:04,658 --> 02:37:08,924
l try to reason first.
And then l use my weapons.

1252
02:37:23,209 --> 02:37:25,143
Sorry, sir.
You can't go in.

1253
02:37:49,269 --> 02:37:52,067
What have you done, Azad?
You've killed him?

1254
02:37:52,806 --> 02:37:56,333
Are you out of your mind? You were
only asked to interrogate him!

1255
02:37:56,810 --> 02:38:00,007
Who gave you the orders to kill him?
Who gave you the permission?

1256
02:38:00,747 --> 02:38:03,682
You have no right to punish anyone.
You are no judge.

1257
02:38:04,250 --> 02:38:06,684
You're a mere police officer.
- No!

1258
02:38:11,358 --> 02:38:16,728
l'm not merely a police officer.
l'm also an lndian. An lndian!

1259
02:38:25,338 --> 02:38:28,535
When someone's mother
is being raped...

1260
02:38:28,742 --> 02:38:32,269
does he wait for permission?
No.

1261
02:38:33,146 --> 02:38:36,741
He'll kill the monster right there.
And that's what l have done.

1262
02:38:37,851 --> 02:38:40,411
Because, for me, my mother and my
motherland are one and the same thing.

1263
02:38:41,855 --> 02:38:46,121
l'll kill all those traitors who
are aiding and abetting such devils.

1264
02:38:47,193 --> 02:38:50,060
And it's not only l who has
the right to kill such feinds.

1265
02:38:50,230 --> 02:38:56,066
Every lndian has it. And nobody
can take away that right from us!

1266
02:39:03,076 --> 02:39:09,072
Azad, we understand your feelings.
But Singhania has threatened us...

1267
02:39:09,315 --> 02:39:12,409
unless we release Wasim Khan
by 5 p.m....

1268
02:39:12,652 --> 02:39:15,086
he will trigger off blasts
all over the city.

1269
02:39:15,555 --> 02:39:18,786
He has even planted a bomb
in one of the BEST buses.

1270
02:39:20,860 --> 02:39:22,725
We still have time.

1271
02:39:24,864 --> 02:39:27,196
Azad, we stand by you.

1272
02:39:41,881 --> 02:39:44,213
Mr Singhania?
This is Moutho here.

1273
02:39:44,918 --> 02:39:47,819
We have a problem, sir.
A very serious problem.

1274
02:39:48,354 --> 02:39:52,188
Our plans have gone haywire.
Azad has killed Wasim Khan.

1275
02:39:52,592 --> 02:39:54,856
He has also got to know
that we're the ones...

1276
02:39:55,061 --> 02:39:57,655
who have planted a bomb in
one of the BEST buses.

1277
02:40:08,341 --> 02:40:11,071
Which bus have they wired?
- l don't know anything...

1278
02:40:11,344 --> 02:40:15,542
All l know is that the guy
who planted the bomb...

1279
02:40:15,949 --> 02:40:20,545
is staying at Hotel Whalley's
in Room No. 302

1280
02:40:23,990 --> 02:40:27,824
Let's announce that a bomb has been
planted in one of the BEST buses.

1281
02:40:28,228 --> 02:40:31,163
We'll stop all the buses from playing.
- No, sir. We can't do that.

1282
02:40:31,498 --> 02:40:33,432
lf the public get to know
about the bomb,...

1283
02:40:33,666 --> 02:40:35,600
there'll be panic
all over the city.

1284
02:40:36,002 --> 02:40:38,732
But we must stop the buses to find out
which of them is carrying the bomb.

1285
02:40:39,005 --> 02:40:40,939
How else will we stop the buses?

1286
02:40:45,144 --> 02:40:46,543
l'll stop it.

1287
02:41:02,996 --> 02:41:04,691
Long live the Union!

1288
02:41:04,998 --> 02:41:06,693
Why've the transport workers
gone on a strike?

1289
02:41:07,000 --> 02:41:09,560
A cop beat up a driver without
any reason. That's why.

1290
02:41:10,003 --> 02:41:13,404
Long live the Union!

1291
02:41:13,873 --> 02:41:15,738
Down with police atrocities

1292
02:41:27,153 --> 02:41:29,986
He has confessed that
he has planted the bomb.

1293
02:41:30,390 --> 02:41:32,290
But he can't tell us
the number of the bus.

1294
02:41:32,725 --> 02:41:36,058
What he told us was that the bus
was parked at the depot in Andheri.

1295
02:41:38,498 --> 02:41:43,197
You set the time for 5 p.m.
And you don't know which bus?

1296
02:41:54,080 --> 02:41:58,278
Which means the bus in which the bomb
was planted, was freshly painted.

1297
02:41:59,886 --> 02:42:01,751
This is the time-keeper
at Andheri Bus Depot, sir.

1298
02:42:02,188 --> 02:42:04,713
Did you guys paint a bus last night?
- Yes, sir.

1299
02:42:05,191 --> 02:42:09,628
What's the number of the bus?
- 84 Ltd. MH02 T96.

1300
02:42:10,063 --> 02:42:13,294
The bus is in the depot, right?
- No, sir. lt left long ago.

1301
02:42:13,733 --> 02:42:15,792
What? Can you tell me where
the bus might be right now?

1302
02:42:16,235 --> 02:42:18,169
The bus plies between
Andheri and Mantrayala.

1303
02:42:18,571 --> 02:42:20,505
At 9, it reaches Vile Parle.
At 9.30, it's at Santacruz...

1304
02:42:20,873 --> 02:42:22,773
at 1 1 , it's in Worli and at noon,
it reaches Mantralaya.

1305
02:42:23,076 --> 02:42:26,978
Since the staffers are on strike the
bus ought to be somewhere in Worli.

1306
02:43:23,036 --> 02:43:25,095
There's a bomb in this bus.
Clear the area immediately.

1307
02:43:27,306 --> 02:43:29,035
There's a bomb in this bus!

1308
02:43:42,655 --> 02:43:43,713
Come on!

1309
02:43:49,162 --> 02:43:50,891
That's the bomb.

1310
02:44:04,610 --> 02:44:06,544
You're a very intelligent
police officer.

1311
02:44:08,181 --> 02:44:11,378
You easily found out which bus
the bomb was planted in.

1312
02:44:12,952 --> 02:44:17,286
But you do have a shortcoming.
You don't recognise people.

1313
02:44:19,158 --> 02:44:21,422
You took my men for guys
from the bomb squad.

1314
02:44:23,162 --> 02:44:26,598
Had you listened to me
and let Wasim Khan go...

1315
02:44:27,300 --> 02:44:32,101
you would have been spared,
so would this city and its people.

1316
02:44:33,172 --> 02:44:36,107
But the shot has
already been fired.

1317
02:44:37,176 --> 02:44:42,113
You will now witness how l turn
this city into a graveyard.

1318
02:44:42,949 --> 02:44:44,348
Take him away.

1319
02:49:41,313 --> 02:49:46,012
O countrymen...
do not sell your country

1320
02:49:46,452 --> 02:49:51,185
Do not sell this sacred land;
do not sell the skies...

1321
02:49:51,657 --> 02:49:56,526
Martyrs have laid down
their lives for the country

1322
02:49:56,996 --> 02:50:02,400
Do not heap disgrace
on their shrouds
