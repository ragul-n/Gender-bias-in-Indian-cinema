3
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,810
Excuse me, but I hired the taxi first.
Please take another taxi.

4
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:07,700
Excuse me, but I've been waiting here
for 15 minutes. I hired the taxi first.

5
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:10,580
- No, you are wrong.
- You're wrong.

6
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,570
Driver, you decide.

7
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:17,730
I didn't pay attention to who called
me first. I thought you were together.

8
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:24,020
- Sir, you take another taxi.
- Why should I?

9
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,980
- Why can't she take another taxi?
- Then decide among yourselves.

10
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:30,586
Drive to the police station.
A decision will be made there.

11
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:35,410
Wait; I'll get off. First they behave
rudely, then threaten to call the police.

12
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,700
Driver, move.

13
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,360
Don't you eat? Massage harder.

14
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:57,210
Come on, sir! Even the asses in the
military were afraid of my massage.

15
00:03:57,610 --> 00:03:59,010
I'll do it harder.

16
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:06,180
You ass! You broke the cot.

17
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:10,070
How am I at fault? Why don't you
get the massage done on the floor?

18
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:11,870
- Hello.
- Hello.

19
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,780
Is a room available in your lodge?

20
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:20,490
- Where have you come from?
- From Jallandhar.

21
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:24,030
- So you are Punjabi?
- Yes.

22
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:27,380
- I'll pay you rent.
- That you'll have to.

23
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:29,890
But you can't stay
for more than 3 days.

24
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:33,410
I only want to stay for 1-2 days.
I'll leave as soon as I get a room.

25
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:38,120
Kumarswami, go open the
corner room for him.

26
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,100
Come sir.

27
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:55,986
- Hello.
- Hello.

28
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:59,780
- You have a room to let?
- Yes, come in.

29
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:05,180
Please be seated.
Father will join you in a moment.

30
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,840
Thank you, I'm fine.

31
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:11,070
Wow! Can I take a look?

32
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:13,210
Sure.

33
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:28,640
Oh, so you're a painter?

34
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,140
Oh, I just draw lines.

35
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:38,850
You're very humble. If these are just
lines, what will pictures be, Mister...?

36
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,540
- Banerjee, Ashok Banerjee.
- And I'm Anand.

37
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:42,966
Pleased to meet you.

38
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:44,586
I've come to learn radio engineering.

39
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:47,360
That's even better.
Our radio is never working.

40
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:49,280
You'll at least repair it.

41
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:53,140
If not repair it,
I'll at least learn to repair it.

42
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:56,350
Father has come.

43
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:11,820
- Hello.
- Hello.

44
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,640
I want the room you have available.

45
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,470
But are you Bengali or Indian?

46
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:25,710
Bengali or Indian?
You can say I'm Indian.

47
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:34,020
Actually, we've given
the room to someone else.

48
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:37,440
But in today's newspaper...

49
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,770
When father? I've been here all day
and nobody has come.

50
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:50,070
It's okay, I understood.
I'll look somewhere else.

51
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:52,770
- Good day.
- Good day.

52
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:04,350
- I'm sorry Mr. Anand, I didn't know.
- It's okay, at least I met you.

53
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,160
Good day.

54
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:13,780
- Who did you rent the room to?
- I haven't, I will.

55
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:18,330
Then why did you refuse him?
He seemed to be a nice man.

56
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:21,640
- Maybe, but he wasn't Bengali.
- So what?

57
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:27,070
I'll rent the room
only to a Bengali.

58
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:35,710
I only want a Marwari paying guest.

59
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:48,640
Why are you chewing my brain? I told
you I'll give the room only to a Sindhi.

60
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:57,610
Yes, that's okay, but we
want a Marathi paying guest.

61
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:05,520
- You have a room to let?
- Yes, but what caste are you?

62
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:11,150
- Are you a Gujarati or an Indian?
- I'm not Gujarati, but I'm an Indian.

63
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,440
Didn't you read in the ad?

64
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:16,910
It clearly states only Gujarati
paying guests are allowed.

65
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:21,370
Strange!

66
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:25,490
- Now what?
- I ask you...

67
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:29,410
there's place for a Marwari,
a Bengali, a Gujarati...

68
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:32,390
but not for an Indian?
Where will an Indian live?

69
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,120
In India.

70
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:40,116
India is the best in the world

71
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:43,080
We are its birds,
this is our garden

72
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:59,150
India is the best in the world

73
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:08,710
- Tell me something.
- What is it?

74
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:17,130
- Where is India?
- Are you drunk, sir?

75
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,500
If this is not India,
then what is it?

76
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:25,720
No, I found, Madras, Gujarat,
Bengal, Maharastra here...

77
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,180
but I didn't find India anywhere.

78
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:35,360
What are you talking, sir?
This is India.

79
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:39,780
He's Bengali, he's Gujarati.

80
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:45,730
He's Madrasi, he's Marathi, Punjabi,
everyone is here.

81
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:47,590
Aren't they?

82
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:52,800
Yes, but if there is India,
it is only in your compound.

83
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:55,840
Just move out of your doors and see.

84
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,100
- Kumarswami, did you understand him?
- Yes.

85
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,740
- What did you understand?
- Nothing.

86
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,530
Come out of your home

87
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:37,760
Come out of your home

88
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:45,830
Watch the world's gaiety again

89
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:08,150
Why are you sleeping, Ghanshyam?

90
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,800
The world has changed

91
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:22,420
It has moved ahead

92
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:36,150
Why are you sitting
dejected in a blind alley?

93
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:39,380
Come out of your home

94
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:08,090
What are you afraid of?

95
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:16,860
Oil has been drawn from water

96
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:22,470
Trains run on electricity

97
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:36,160
Soon, an atom drawn horse
will reach the moon and stars

98
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:42,430
Come out of your home

99
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,830
What are you thinking, Bansi?

100
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:08,530
Forget the past

101
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:14,260
Think of the future

102
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:27,940
Don't sing an old song
on a broken drum

103
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:31,170
Come out of your home

104
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:04,040
Sir, tea.

105
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:11,010
- Got a room?
- How can I?

106
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:14,460
There is one lyer here, but even
he wants a Madrasi paying guest.

107
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:17,400
- Then go and see him.
- What's the point?

108
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:21,810
What's the harm? He won't let out his
room, but he'll let you return home.

109
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:24,560
Alright, I'll meet him if you say so.

110
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:30,240
Sir, I'm sure you'll get this room.

111
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:32,690
How's that?

112
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:42,140
- You...?
- I'm 100% Madrasi.

113
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:46,180
- Didn't you realise from my attire?
- I can see that.

114
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:50,610
- But I'm asking your name.
- Anand Kumarswami.

115
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,240
Anand Kumarswami? Come.

116
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:05,940
Look what a nice room it is.
A separate door, three windows.

117
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:13,090
It's a nice room.
How much rent will you charge?

118
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:18,820
We share the same caste.
I'll just charge Rs.30 a month.

119
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:21,780
- You'll have to pay in advance.
- Rs.30?

120
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:28,480
Outsiders pay Rs.50, but since you're
the same caste, I'm charging less.

121
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,180
Okay.

122
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:40,930
- When can I move in?
- It's yours. You can come right now.

123
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:46,610
I've had breakfast.

124
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:53,100
An important man has come.
Let me introduce you to him. Come.

125
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:56,490
Come.

126
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,180
This is my new tenant.

127
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,280
- Hello.
- Hello.

128
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:13,860
He's the President of the South
Indian Association, Mr. Subramanium.

129
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:29,970
- I speak very little Tamil.
- What kind of a Madrasi are you?

130
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:31,770
I'm a true blue Madrasi.

131
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:36,190
Actually, my father is a contractor
in Punjab for the last 20 years.

132
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:38,320
And I was educated there.

133
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:43,710
No problem. You have changed
your state, but not your attire.

134
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:49,610
That's true, but sometimes, I have to
change my attire to fit the situation.

135
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:53,670
I even wear a coat sometimes.

136
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:58,040
Mr. lyer, don't forget to bring him
for the function.

137
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:03,230
Because the future of our culture and
traditions must be carried on by the youth.

138
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:08,190
- I'll come by evening.
- This is your house.

139
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,760
- Come anytime you want.
- Good day.

140
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,150
He seems to be a nice man.

141
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:38,460
Oh, it's you?
Tell me, what can I do for you?

142
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:41,260
You already have.
Watch what I do now.

143
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:44,240
Eh?

144
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:15,390
Pure edible oil available here.

145
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:18,290
One who proves it is adulterated
will get a reward of Rs.1000.

146
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,790
Uncle, making the oil pure?

147
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:48,710
You applying all kinds of labels.

148
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:53,230
It's labels that are important.
Who cares for the product inside?

149
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,580
And what's that board on display outside?

150
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:59,860
The day I need Rs.1000, I'll prove
how you adulterate the oil.

151
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:05,520
Don't be fooled by it. Like my oil,
even my reward is adulterated.

152
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:09,290
- Understand? Anyway, how's your father?
- He's fine.

153
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:12,290
He's asked you
to send a tin of pure oil.

154
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:16,560
Pure oil? Okay,
I'll arrange it by evening.

155
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,240
Why, don't you have it available
in the shop now?

156
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:24,120
Only the oil in God's lamp
is pure in this shop.

157
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:29,340
God can catch you.
That's why you're afraid of him?

158
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,830
If I was afraid of him,
why would I sell adulterated stuff?

159
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:41,420
Oh yes. Take, read this letter.
It's from your aunt. Sit down.

160
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:47,080
Uncle, why don't you
learn to read Hindi?

161
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:50,740
How was I to know I'd need it?

162
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,890
Anyway, I'll learn now.
You read the letter.

163
00:19:56,410 --> 00:19:58,900
'Brother Sadhuram, may you live long'

164
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:02,790
'Everything is fine here.
I pray you're fine, too.'

165
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:05,090
Forget all that. Read what's important.

166
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,570
'I've lost my sleep over Mohini.'

167
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:15,680
'As she grows, so does my fear.'

168
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:19,450
'You haven't found
a suitable groom for her yet.'

169
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:23,850
Now hear that! As if grooms are
growing in the streets of New Delhi.

170
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:31,950
'That's why I'm coming myself.
I'll reach New Delhi Saturday evening.'

171
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,200
'Come to the station to meet me.'

172
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:38,270
'Regards from Murli.
Your sister, Rambhajani.'

173
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:43,900
Uncle, why don't you invite Mohini here?
She should see Delhi, too.

174
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:49,350
I'll find a groom from Delhi for her.
Then she can see Delhi all her life.

175
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:52,496
Bansi, what do you want?

176
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,416
I want to show a customer
a fake sample.

177
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,496
Do you want to show him a sample
or expose me?

178
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:59,240
You go, I'll show him the sample.
Idiot!

179
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:15,420
Here, see the sample.

180
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:24,250
Wow, the ghee is good.
Where is it from?

181
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:29,610
From all over the country.
Udipi, Amritsar, Coimbatore...

182
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:34,610
Why are you standing here, dear?
Tell your father I'll send the oil home.

183
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:56,540
- How are you?
- Fine.

184
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:57,980
Father went to Calcutta.

185
00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:00,210
If you haven't found a place yet,
you can come over.

186
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:02,836
I've found a place,
and it's close to your home.

187
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:03,960
Really?

188
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,780
What else? How do you find Delhi?

189
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:09,850
The city is good,
but the people here are strange.

190
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:12,010
- Why?
- They throw muck at each other.

191
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:16,450
People are good. You must have
come across some crazy person.

192
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:19,690
Take, have some grams.

193
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:25,910
If you want to talk,
you can come here.

194
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,740
No, why should he come here?
He was standing there before you.

195
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:32,800
- Then you come here.
- No, I'm afraid of the police.

196
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,560
We're fine where we are.

197
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:59,870
- Where are you headed?
- Just sightseeing.

198
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:04,240
I wanted to develop this film.
Suggest some good lab.

199
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:06,780
There's a good photo shop in
Daryaganj. Leave it there.

200
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:09,780
- Daryaganj?
- I'll tell you when it comes.

201
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:11,150
Okay.

202
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:34,310
- Look, over there.
- Thank you. See you again.

203
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:46,486
- Why are you following me?
- Who's following you?

204
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:49,060
- I'm going my way.
- Then go. Why are you standing here?

205
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,120
This street doesn't belong to you.

206
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,300
Don't you feel ashamed
to tease a lone woman?

207
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,660
- Get lost!
- What's going on?

208
00:23:56,710 --> 00:24:01,540
- This guy was teasing a girl.
- Then knock out his teeth.

209
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:04,040
- What nonsense are you talking?
- We're talking nonsense?

210
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,180
- You rascal!
- Your father is a rascal!

211
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,400
How dare you abuse my father!

212
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:12,150
Why are you fighting?
He's over there.

213
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:18,890
Come out! Come out and I'll teach you
a lesson for teasing a girl.

214
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:35,250
Who do you want to meet?

215
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:40,720
Who has sent you here?

216
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:44,070
- Get out!
- Go away.

217
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:49,260
- I'm sorry.
- Where are you going?

218
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:51,990
I was telling this fool.

219
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:57,810
Come in.
Actually, I hate tuneless men.

220
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:01,050
What's most important in
today's world is tune.

221
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:08,250
And I feel, more than the UNO,
the world needs to be in tune.

222
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:12,390
So tell me, what brings you here?

223
00:25:12,810 --> 00:25:15,570
Are you interested in learning music?

224
00:25:16,770 --> 00:25:20,900
Yes, that's what's after me.

225
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:28,330
Good. Even your voice
sounds quite melodious.

226
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:32,600
Alright, fill out this form.

227
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:40,870
Let me fill it for you.
What is your name?

228
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:46,010
It's, it's Anand (happy).

229
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:49,170
I'm not asking how you are,
I'm asking your name.

230
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:51,420
My name is Anand.

231
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,090
Why did you come here?

232
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:00,380
- Hello.
- Hello.

233
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:04,030
- Kumarswami?
- Yes, Anand Kumarswami.

234
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:08,020
He is of my caste. He is my tenant.
We are from the same state.

235
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:13,670
Both my children
learn music from him.

236
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:20,770
- Mr. Kumarswami, pay Rs.15.
- Rs.15?

237
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:24,430
Only Rs.15. Rs.10 towards fees,
and Rs.5 admission fees.

238
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:34,220
I left my wallet at home.
I'll pay tomorrow.

239
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:38,190
Never keep today's work
pending for tomorrow.

240
00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:47,650
Here's a receipt of Rs.15.

241
00:26:47,890 --> 00:26:51,730
Take the balance Rs.5 from
me tomorrow.

242
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:58,100
Mr. lyer, I'll introduce Anand
to his teacher.

243
00:26:58,210 --> 00:27:00,520
- Okay.
- Please come.

244
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:10,500
Come here.

245
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:14,670
He is, come here, mister.

246
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:27,640
She is Miss Janaki,
a professor of music and dance.

247
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:31,890
And he is our new student,
Mr. Anand Kumarswami.

248
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:35,070
He does seem to have a good voice.

249
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:38,140
His ear for music drew him here.

250
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:43,830
Arrange the schedule with him.

251
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:48,400
And I, some money arrangements.

252
00:27:57,350 --> 00:28:01,290
Come here. You guys take a rest.

253
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,300
- So, love for music brought you here?
- Yes, you can assume that.

254
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:18,450
Sit down.

255
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:22,320
- Sing something.
- Sing?

256
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:25,740
- That's what I've come here to learn.
- I know.

257
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:31,440
But one who likes to sing,
hums something.

258
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:36,030
Sing whatever you can.
I want to know your tone.

259
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:42,580
- That's in your hands.
- You better begin.

260
00:29:12,530 --> 00:29:14,820
Quiet! Enough, stop.

261
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:19,250
Ustad Machchar Khan
tutored me for a few days.

262
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:22,780
Oh. Then why did he stop?

263
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:26,020
What do I say? He went mad.

264
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:33,900
He had to. Look Mr. Anand,
music is not your cup of tea.

265
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:40,010
- Please learn something else.
- What do I learn? I am so confused.

266
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:42,600
There are lots of things
you can do.

267
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:47,160
- Like?
- Tiffs, fights, riots...

268
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:51,950
teasing girls on the road.
Don't waste your money here.

269
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:01,210
The moment our eyes met...

270
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:07,430
The moment our eyes met,
you entered my heart

271
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:09,630
I regret...

272
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:13,730
I regret it's put you in a dilemma

273
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:16,100
The moment our eyes met...

274
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:24,250
The moment our eyes met
I lost my heart

275
00:30:51,770 --> 00:30:55,800
Tugged by my heart,
I kept moving close to you

276
00:30:55,970 --> 00:31:00,070
How was I to know
I'd forget my way?

277
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:14,950
I was going somewhere...

278
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:19,120
I was going somewhere
but wound upsomewhere else

279
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:21,540
The moment our eyes met...

280
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:29,960
The moment our eyes met
I lost my heart

281
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:46,550
Your magical eyes kept smiling

282
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:50,760
They kept smiling
and stealing my heart

283
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:05,580
When I complained...

284
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:10,230
When I complained,
she waved it of with a smile

285
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,260
The moment our eyes met...

286
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:22,790
The moment our eyes met
I lost my heart

287
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:49,910
I'll return the way I came

288
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:52,000
Keep my heart...

289
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:04,640
Keep my heart.
I'll even leave my heart

290
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:08,770
Even if it is this sorrow...

291
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:13,640
Even if it is this sorrow,
at least I got something from you

292
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,650
The moment our eyes met...

293
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:23,940
The moment our eyes met
I lost my heart

294
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,530
- You're angry with me?
- Why are you after me?

295
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:54,410
You want to make a
laughing stock of me even here.

296
00:33:54,550 --> 00:33:56,250
I didn't come deliberately.

297
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:59,600
If destiny is bringing us together,
what can I do?

298
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:03,360
- You can at least leave.
- Why, am I so tuneless?

299
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:08,480
No, your voice is very good.
Have you come to learn, or teach music?

300
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:12,260
- Teach?
- Of course. You sing so well.

301
00:34:14,429 --> 00:34:19,249
I do sing, but if I can get some
polishing from you, I'll sing better.

302
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:24,800
I mean, an artisan turns
ordinary clay to a temple.

303
00:34:27,969 --> 00:34:33,499
Wow Kumarswami! You turned
out to be the Emperor of music.

304
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:38,500
By God, I was stunned.

305
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:43,139
Janaki, you're very fortunate
to get a student like him.

306
00:34:43,449 --> 00:34:46,489
I'm fortunate to have
got a tutor like her.

307
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:51,880
Mr. Anand, the Pongal festival is being
celebrated in Janaki's home this Saturday.

308
00:34:52,389 --> 00:34:55,489
- You also come along.
- Pongal?

309
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:00,150
You're a Madrasi. You know
the greatness of this festival.

310
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:03,860
Oh yes, Pongal!
Who doesn't know about Pongal?

311
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:11,786
It will be more fun that day,
because it's the full moon night.

312
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:15,630
Yes, this is how a
full moon night must be.

313
00:35:16,330 --> 00:35:18,140
- How?
- Like your smile.

314
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:22,530
- I was just saying it as an example.
- I understand.

315
00:35:23,010 --> 00:35:24,630
- So will you come?
- No.

316
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:28,030
Perhaps I won't be able to make it.
I've already made other plans.

317
00:35:29,730 --> 00:35:33,400
No problem. We'll try to enjoy
the festival without you.

318
00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:41,110
No problem, don't mind her.
She is actually a very good girl.

319
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,800
Come.

320
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:56,920
Sister Rambhajani,
after the Pongal festival...

321
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:00,770
I'll start looking for a
handsome groom for Mohini.

322
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:04,920
Just as she is Sadhuram's niece,
so she is my niece, too.

323
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:09,690
Yes brother, you must do something.
Sadhuram is a novice.

324
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,370
Since childhood,
he's never worried about anything.

325
00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:18,360
Why should man worry?
God is there to worry for everyone.

326
00:36:19,090 --> 00:36:24,150
God willing, I will get Janaki
and Mohini married together.

327
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:27,930
Father, I'll make
arrangements for the program.

328
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:31,260
Yes, do that.
And give your aunt a good seat.

329
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:34,590
You also go in.

330
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:40,850
Hello.

331
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:45,080
You've come? Good.
I thought you might forget.

332
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:49,556
How is that possible? I refused
another invitation to come here.

333
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:53,280
Thank you very much.
The program is about to begin. Come.

334
00:40:10,010 --> 00:40:17,590
Your flute is my enemy, oh Kanhaiya

335
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:44,760
Crazy...

336
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:48,470
I have become crazy

337
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:52,900
Your flute is my enemy, oh Kanhaiya

338
00:41:18,450 --> 00:41:26,370
In the lanes of Vrindavan,
Radha lost her heart

339
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:40,370
In my enchanting eyes...

340
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:48,160
constantly floats his image

341
00:41:48,210 --> 00:41:53,040
It stole my heart

342
00:41:53,090 --> 00:41:57,770
Your flute is my enemy, oh Kanhaiya

343
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:40,960
He expressed his love
and stole my heart and peace

344
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:44,240
He is after me

345
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:58,240
The naughty one took me
to the river bank

346
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:06,310
And played the melodious tune
of the flute for me

347
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:11,240
It charmed me

348
00:43:11,290 --> 00:43:15,860
Your flute is my enemy, oh Kanhaiya

349
00:44:35,330 --> 00:44:38,960
Wow! For some time I felt
like time had stopped.

350
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:41,220
I've never seen such
a good dance performance.

351
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:45,250
- But you had to go somewhere else.
- This is where I had to come.

352
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:48,390
- How is that?
- Actually...

353
00:44:48,630 --> 00:44:51,020
the South Indian Association's
president had invited...

354
00:44:51,170 --> 00:44:53,420
- Who, father?
- No, Mr. Subramanium.

355
00:44:53,830 --> 00:44:56,280
- He's my father.
- Your father?

356
00:44:56,590 --> 00:44:58,930
- Yes.
- Oh, so he's your father?

357
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:05,120
Janaki, he is,
you two know each other?

358
00:45:05,290 --> 00:45:09,770
- I'm a student in Kala Mandir.
- Oh, I see. Here, have coffee.

359
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:16,110
- Hello.
- Hello.

360
00:45:18,650 --> 00:45:22,486
- What is it, father?
- A new manager is taking over.

361
00:45:22,510 --> 00:45:23,910
He's taking charge tomorrow.

362
00:45:24,510 --> 00:45:27,560
Tomorrow is Sunday.
He'll take charge on a holiday?

363
00:45:27,890 --> 00:45:31,590
- What kind of a man is he?
- He's Punjabi. That's all I know yet.

364
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:35,680
Mr. Kumarswami, you've dealt
quite often with therm.

365
00:45:35,730 --> 00:45:39,920
The Punjabis I've known
have been very good.

366
00:45:40,030 --> 00:45:42,080
- I'll take your leave.
- Mundu.

367
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,510
- Do come over sometimes.
- Sure.

368
00:45:47,860 --> 00:45:49,830
- Don't bother, I'll go.
- It's okay.

369
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:53,880
- Good day.
- Good day.

370
00:45:59,270 --> 00:46:02,940
- I'll take your leave.
- You seem to be in a hurry.

371
00:46:03,830 --> 00:46:05,330
Perhaps you're bored with us?

372
00:46:05,620 --> 00:46:08,610
Of course not.
How can anyone get bored with friends?

373
00:46:10,230 --> 00:46:13,320
If I could,
I'd spend maximum time with you.

374
00:46:14,870 --> 00:46:19,380
- What's your program tomorrow?
- I have to go to the Red Fort.

375
00:46:20,050 --> 00:46:23,340
To see Moghul attire
for my dance show.

376
00:46:23,790 --> 00:46:28,730
Okay. Anyway, that's business.
What are you doing before that?

377
00:46:29,630 --> 00:46:31,870
You tell me what I can do.

378
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:37,940
Tomorrow is Sunday..
Why not go to the Jamuna river bank?

379
00:46:38,540 --> 00:46:40,300
There must be arrangements
for boating there.

380
00:46:40,750 --> 00:46:43,400
There are boating arrangements
near the President House too.

381
00:46:44,030 --> 00:46:45,630
That will be a better place.

382
00:46:47,130 --> 00:46:49,550
If you're with me,
every place will be beautiful.

383
00:46:51,450 --> 00:46:53,680
I'll come tomorrow at 9:30 AM.

384
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:56,850
Your home is on the way.
I'll pick you up.

385
00:46:57,570 --> 00:47:02,010
Thank you.
I hope you remember my name.

386
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:06,510
- Mr. Kumarswami.
- Anand Kumarswami.

387
00:47:07,530 --> 00:47:10,120
But for you, it's only Anand.

388
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:34,140
Brother, your letter.

389
00:47:36,130 --> 00:47:37,430
It's from father.

390
00:47:43,910 --> 00:47:48,740
'Anand, you'll be pleased to know
I've got a transfer to Delhi.'

391
00:47:49,450 --> 00:47:52,280
'We'll reach Delhi on Sunday
morning by the Frontier Mail.'

392
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:55,490
'My company is
providing me a house to stay in.'

393
00:47:56,110 --> 00:47:57,610
'Meet us at the station.'

394
00:47:58,080 --> 00:48:00,220
Tomorrow morning? Damn!

395
00:48:16,070 --> 00:48:20,120
- Mom.
- Bless you, son. How are you?

396
00:48:20,210 --> 00:48:22,810
- I'm fine. Father.
- Bless you.

397
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:29,660
Take this, get the luggage.
And count the baggage correctly.

398
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:33,620
- Come on, hurry.
- Have you arranged for a porter?

399
00:48:33,690 --> 00:48:38,860
- I've arranged everything.
- Why do we need a servant? We have him.

400
00:48:39,050 --> 00:48:42,840
- Mom, just listen to her!
- You two already started fighting?

401
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:44,340
Come!

402
00:48:47,950 --> 00:48:50,530
I've brought the porter, mom.
Come.

403
00:48:52,910 --> 00:48:55,840
- He's a very nice man.
- Greetings madam.

404
00:48:56,170 --> 00:48:57,880
- What's his name?
- Kumarswami.

405
00:48:58,160 --> 00:48:59,700
- What?
- Kumarswami.

406
00:49:00,350 --> 00:49:05,380
I won't call you Swami.
We call our servants Mundu.

407
00:49:05,650 --> 00:49:08,880
- I'll call you Mundu.
- Call me whatever you like.

408
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:12,410
- My old employer called me an ass.
- Where are you from?

409
00:49:13,060 --> 00:49:17,070
- From Madras.
- Go to the kitchen and do the dishes.

410
00:49:17,130 --> 00:49:19,290
- Come with me.
- Don't worry about the salary.

411
00:49:20,950 --> 00:49:22,650
- Mom, can I go?
- Yes.

412
00:49:26,180 --> 00:49:28,950
- Where are you going?
- I've done everything, father.

413
00:49:29,070 --> 00:49:32,810
I counted the bags.
Take a look.

414
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:35,590
I will.
Get everything put away.

415
00:49:35,910 --> 00:49:38,910
Everything is just lying around.
The home looks more like a shack.

416
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:41,980
- Get me a glass of water.
- Mundu!

417
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:44,440
- Coming.
- Bring father a glass of water.

418
00:49:44,650 --> 00:49:45,750
Yes.

419
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:50,190
- Mundu? Have you brought a servant?
- Yes. Can I go now?

420
00:49:50,540 --> 00:49:54,770
- Shut-up! Where is he from?
- I'm from Madras.

421
00:49:59,020 --> 00:50:01,790
Anand, you always do things differently.

422
00:50:02,330 --> 00:50:05,270
What will a Madrasi servant
do in a Punjabi home?

423
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:10,280
Father, he cooks very good Punjabi food.
He's also hard working and honest.

424
00:50:10,510 --> 00:50:14,040
Yes, he's very simple. He sought
my blessing the moment he came in.

425
00:50:14,290 --> 00:50:20,440
That does it! One who seeks
your blessing has to be the best.

426
00:50:21,770 --> 00:50:23,560
Mundu, bring me my hookah.

427
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:29,950
Why are you standing here? Go do some
work. I said you can't go out today.

428
00:51:05,030 --> 00:51:06,430
What is it, dear?

429
00:51:09,150 --> 00:51:12,446
- Can I go to see the Red Fort?
- You've just arrived.

430
00:51:12,470 --> 00:51:13,870
Go some other day.

431
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:17,300
- Why not today?
- Who will go with you today?

432
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:21,620
- Can't brother come along?
- No, he has lots of work to do.

433
00:51:22,310 --> 00:51:25,140
What work?
He only has to put everything away.

434
00:51:26,110 --> 00:51:28,510
Mundu has come. He'll do it.

435
00:51:29,140 --> 00:51:31,400
Can't you go see the Red Fort tomorrow?

436
00:51:32,750 --> 00:51:36,550
Father, this is what you always do.

437
00:51:37,750 --> 00:51:41,310
You push everything to tomorrow.

438
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:51,800
Okay, don't make a face.
Tell Anand to take you.

439
00:52:03,130 --> 00:52:04,330
Coming, father.

440
00:52:07,190 --> 00:52:11,010
- What is it, father?
- Take your sister to the Red Fort.

441
00:52:11,390 --> 00:52:13,940
- Red Fort? Today?
- Yes, now.

442
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:18,986
How can I go now? The furniture has to
be put in place. Everything is a mess.

443
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:21,240
Go I said! Work indeed!

444
00:52:21,390 --> 00:52:23,570
How was work done in this house
before you were born?

445
00:52:23,690 --> 00:52:27,540
- But father, you said...
- And now I'm saying take her.

446
00:52:27,660 --> 00:52:29,966
- Come on, brother.
- Keep quiet! How do I tell you...

447
00:52:29,990 --> 00:52:34,110
- You keep quiet! Take your sister.
- As you wish.

448
00:52:36,220 --> 00:52:37,770
- Come, Nikki.
- Okay.

449
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:44,320
This is India Gate.

450
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:59,420
It's a memorial for those
who died in the first world war.

451
00:52:59,890 --> 00:53:01,990
You go take a look.
I'll be back in 10 minutes.

452
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:04,680
No, I only want to see the Red Fort.

453
00:53:19,350 --> 00:53:22,850
- This is Diwane-Aam.
- What is Diwane-Aam?

454
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:26,080
You don't know?
The Emperor used to hold court here.

455
00:53:26,660 --> 00:53:30,000
The Emperor used to sit here,
and the Kings would sit here.

456
00:53:30,690 --> 00:53:34,040
Kinsmen would sit here,
and the commoners behind them.

457
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:35,850
Understood? Move.

458
00:53:44,230 --> 00:53:45,530
Hey! That's Ashok.

459
00:53:51,150 --> 00:53:54,500
- How are you?
- I'm fine. She's my sister, Nirmala.

460
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:57,906
I brought her to see the Red Fort.
And he is Mr. Ashok Banerjee.

461
00:53:57,930 --> 00:53:59,426
- He's an excellent painter.
- Hello.

462
00:53:59,450 --> 00:54:01,630
- What are you painting?
- I just can't make anything.

463
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:03,420
I made many sketches and erased them.

464
00:54:03,460 --> 00:54:05,410
Looks like you want to take
a big jump.

465
00:54:09,740 --> 00:54:14,346
If you don't mind,
may I sketch you?

466
00:54:14,370 --> 00:54:15,866
- I...
- Why would she mind?

467
00:54:15,890 --> 00:54:19,020
It's fortunate that an artist like
you makes such a request.

468
00:54:19,410 --> 00:54:22,366
- Yet, what do you think?
- I...

469
00:54:22,390 --> 00:54:25,350
- She herself likes to paint.
- That's even better.

470
00:54:25,550 --> 00:54:28,620
It'll take you 20-25 minutes
to sketch her?

471
00:54:28,860 --> 00:54:32,050
- Yes.
- Then I'll meet a professor and return.

472
00:54:32,270 --> 00:54:35,200
- Be back soon.
- In a jiffy.

473
00:54:41,140 --> 00:54:45,786
- Sorry Janaki, I ran late. Actually...
- I know. Your father has arrived.

474
00:54:45,810 --> 00:54:47,210
- Yes.
- Where's he staying?

475
00:54:47,260 --> 00:54:50,070
- At a friend's place..
- Okay, come and sit.

476
00:54:54,540 --> 00:54:56,730
Give me the oar.
Your arms must be tired.

477
00:54:57,430 --> 00:55:01,930
I don't know about my arms, but my
eyes sure got tired waiting for you.

478
00:55:17,510 --> 00:55:19,720
Enough.
Thank you, the sketch is done.

479
00:55:23,990 --> 00:55:26,450
This is just a sketch yet.
I'll make a portrait of it.

480
00:55:29,190 --> 00:55:31,900
- Brother hasn't yet returned?
- He'll come.

481
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:34,680
Oh! You've come to see the Red Fort.

482
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:39,030
Until Anand returns,
let me show you around.

483
00:55:41,730 --> 00:55:45,346
- I'll take you to Diwane-Aam.
- Brother showed me that.

484
00:55:45,370 --> 00:55:48,130
Really? Okay, then
we'll go towards Sawan Badho.

485
00:56:43,930 --> 00:56:46,880
- Anand, you're here?
- I was coming to you.

486
00:56:46,990 --> 00:56:48,520
I went with her to the museum.

487
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:53,800
Meet her, she's Janaki,
a music and dance artist.

488
00:56:54,700 --> 00:56:56,650
He's Ashok Banerjee,
a very good painter.

489
00:56:57,390 --> 00:57:01,800
- And she is, let's have tea.
- But what did you tell me?

490
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:05,800
Anand, you didn't introduce her.
She is Nirmala, Anand's sister.

491
00:57:06,860 --> 00:57:07,960
Hello.

492
00:57:10,340 --> 00:57:11,766
- Anand's sister?
- Yes...

493
00:57:11,790 --> 00:57:13,986
I told you father is staying
with his friend. She's his daughter.

494
00:57:14,010 --> 00:57:15,106
Brother?

495
00:57:15,130 --> 00:57:18,740
It's very late.
Her father must be waiting. Good day.

496
00:57:19,890 --> 00:57:21,660
- Good day. - Good Day.
- Good Day.

497
00:57:26,450 --> 00:57:31,080
So, she was your professor for
whom you wanted to get rid of me?

498
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:34,730
Am I so bad that you were
embarrassed to introduce me to her?

499
00:57:35,090 --> 00:57:38,760
No sister, actually, she is a Madrasi.

500
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:41,500
And I had to pretend to be a Madrasi
to get a room here.

501
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:45,220
Had I introduced you to her,
everything would be ruined.

502
00:57:45,510 --> 00:57:50,540
- What, everything?
- You don't understand.

503
00:57:52,130 --> 00:57:56,600
Oh, so that's the case.
I'll mess things up for you today.

504
00:57:57,290 --> 00:57:59,100
- Just come before father.
- What?

505
00:58:04,420 --> 00:58:06,950
- I'll surely tell him.
- Go tell him.

506
00:58:07,300 --> 00:58:09,180
- You think I'll pamper you?
- Yes.

507
00:58:09,270 --> 00:58:13,110
Never! Have I committed a theft?
Why should I fear?

508
00:58:13,350 --> 00:58:15,300
I'll boldly reveal
everything to father...

509
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:17,240
Coming father.

510
00:58:17,310 --> 00:58:20,510
- Look, you're my little sister.
- Touch my feet.

511
00:58:20,710 --> 00:58:23,380
- I'm your older brother.
- Touch my feet.

512
00:58:25,230 --> 00:58:29,650
- What are you doing?
- Nothing father. Nikki's shoes broke.

513
00:58:31,850 --> 00:58:34,340
- Nikki, saw the Red Fort?
- Yes, father.

514
00:58:34,820 --> 00:58:38,560
- What else did you see?
- And I saw...

515
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:41,360
I met brother's professor.

516
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:44,580
- What happened?
- Nothing, I fixed her buckle.

517
00:58:46,050 --> 00:58:53,070
- How is his professor?
- Seemed good from his talk.

518
00:58:53,220 --> 00:58:56,300
But he's no good.
What can the professor do?

519
00:58:57,090 --> 00:59:01,240
Listen naughty guy, now that you've got
a good professor, you must work hard.

520
00:59:01,810 --> 00:59:04,530
It's said the fruits of labor are sweet.

521
00:59:04,940 --> 00:59:07,200
The fruits of this labor
will be even more sweet.

522
00:59:07,550 --> 00:59:09,430
Father, I'll try my best...

523
00:59:09,470 --> 00:59:13,260
Okay, the food is ready.
You two go inside.

524
00:59:29,610 --> 00:59:33,810
Gentleman, our company's new manager,
Mr. Daulatram Khanna.

525
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:40,790
He's our company's cashier,
Mr. Jatashanker.

526
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:44,370
- Hello.
- Hello.

527
00:59:52,110 --> 00:59:55,670
He is Bhutaram Bhalla, our supervisor.

528
00:59:56,020 --> 00:59:59,160
- Hello Lalaji.
- Hello Mr. Bhuta, how are you?

529
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:01,710
- I'm fine, by your grace.
- Sit down.

530
01:00:05,710 --> 01:00:10,190
- Who hasn't come?
- Mr. Subramanium, our accountant.

531
01:00:10,780 --> 01:00:12,610
- Send him to me when he comes in.
- Yes.

532
01:00:13,730 --> 01:00:16,430
Lalaji, Mr. Subramanium has come.

533
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:34,450
- Is this your time to come?
- The office starts at 10, sir.

534
01:00:36,470 --> 01:00:38,950
Look, it's 10:10.

535
01:00:39,790 --> 01:00:41,720
But this is the correct radio time.

536
01:00:42,100 --> 01:00:44,780
Maybe, but this is the time to be
followed in the office from today.

537
01:00:46,310 --> 01:00:48,510
Peon, correct the clock.

538
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:53,410
Look Mr. Subramanium,
you are a responsible officer.

539
01:00:54,290 --> 01:00:57,380
If you come late, how will it
affect the other staff members?

540
01:00:58,220 --> 01:00:59,720
I'll be more careful, sir.

541
01:00:59,940 --> 01:01:01,870
It's okay. Bring the files in.

542
01:01:17,610 --> 01:01:20,510
- Mundu, hurry up.
- Yes sister.

543
01:01:22,670 --> 01:01:25,560
- Father, shall I give you some more?
- No dear.

544
01:01:26,220 --> 01:01:27,720
Why? Didn't you like it?

545
01:01:27,770 --> 01:01:32,840
Nonsense! I always overeat
when you cook, Upma.

546
01:01:34,210 --> 01:01:37,200
Besides, I have to hurry.
I'll be late for work.

547
01:01:40,540 --> 01:01:43,110
Wait father. I have to fix a button.

548
01:01:46,270 --> 01:01:49,140
Father, it's not even 9:30 yet.

549
01:01:49,330 --> 01:01:53,140
But as per Daulatram standard time,
it's 9:45 already.

550
01:01:53,860 --> 01:01:56,600
Why? ls his watch
different from the world's?

551
01:01:56,740 --> 01:01:59,170
He himself is different
from the world.

552
01:02:15,470 --> 01:02:20,350
- Mr. Menon was a good man.
- He was Madrasi, after all.

553
01:02:20,920 --> 01:02:22,710
Your own caste people understand you.

554
01:02:23,170 --> 01:02:28,960
Look at Anand. Though he grew up in
Punjab, he hasn't forgotten his roots.

555
01:02:30,300 --> 01:02:33,450
- Why hasn't he come for so long?
- His father has come.

556
01:02:33,690 --> 01:02:38,970
That's even better. If you see him,
tell him I want to meet his father.

557
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:43,710
- Why father?
- Silly girl. Do I have to tell you that?

558
01:02:45,020 --> 01:02:48,850
Oh God, 9:30!
That means it's 9:45!

559
01:02:49,990 --> 01:02:54,300
- Father, will you go without shoes?
- I forgot!

560
01:02:55,360 --> 01:02:57,930
Mundu, you haven't polished
my shoes yet? Bring them quick!

561
01:02:58,490 --> 01:02:59,790
I'm bringing them.

562
01:03:00,060 --> 01:03:01,560
He's always in a hurry.

563
01:03:01,780 --> 01:03:05,070
- Hurry.
- Here sir.

564
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:13,670
- Won't you wear socks?
- Give, I'll put them on in the bus.

565
01:03:16,090 --> 01:03:19,200
- But what's the matter?
- Why does he want to meet him?

566
01:03:19,860 --> 01:03:22,090
Ask him that. I don't know.

567
01:03:24,710 --> 01:03:26,680
Your smile tells me
you know everything.

568
01:03:27,300 --> 01:03:29,490
As if you don't know.
Now don't pretend.

569
01:03:30,330 --> 01:03:32,900
Why does a girl's father
want to meet a boy's father?

570
01:03:33,370 --> 01:03:34,470
Why?

571
01:03:40,180 --> 01:03:43,160
- I understood!
- But you didn't tell me where you live.

572
01:03:43,810 --> 01:03:48,920
- I live here, in New Delhi.
- But which street in New Delhi?

573
01:03:49,270 --> 01:03:54,680
Which street? I forgot.

574
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:57,230
But it's named after some king.

575
01:03:58,150 --> 01:03:59,450
- Babur road?
- No.

576
01:04:00,220 --> 01:04:01,820
- Humayun road?
- No.

577
01:04:02,980 --> 01:04:05,610
- Akbar Road?
- Akbar Road? No.

578
01:04:08,940 --> 01:04:12,170
That's the problem.
If I knew the names of kings...

579
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:14,260
I wouldn't always fail in History.

580
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:17,740
New Delhi's roads
narrate the history of India.

581
01:04:18,340 --> 01:04:22,310
But why is he taking the trouble?
I'll bring father to your home.

582
01:04:22,980 --> 01:04:27,690
- When? Tomorrow?
- Tomorrow? Alright.

583
01:04:28,420 --> 01:04:30,750
- But at what time?
- At 4 O'clock.

584
01:04:31,300 --> 01:04:35,710
- Okay.
- Do come, don't forget.

585
01:04:36,230 --> 01:04:38,540
How can I forget?
I won't sleep all night.

586
01:04:56,730 --> 01:04:59,950
What's the matter?
You seem very worried.

587
01:05:00,820 --> 01:05:03,340
Had a fight with the professor?

588
01:05:03,630 --> 01:05:09,090
I will, when she learns I'm Punjabi.
Janaki's father has called father.

589
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:11,570
Is that all? Then take father.

590
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:15,180
Yes sure! As if I have to die.
Know what her father says?

591
01:05:15,590 --> 01:05:19,650
He says if you come across a snake
and a Punjabi, kill the Punjabi first.

592
01:05:19,850 --> 01:05:25,560
So what? Even our father says that.
Everyone says that about the other.

593
01:05:25,900 --> 01:05:30,240
Madrasi about a Punjabi, Punjabi about
a Sindhi, Sindhi about a Marwari.

594
01:05:30,700 --> 01:05:32,370
It's true for all Indians.

595
01:05:32,660 --> 01:05:36,570
Why should I care about India?
I'm worried about myself.

596
01:05:37,210 --> 01:05:40,340
It's 3:30 and I said I'd
bring father at 4 O'clock.

597
01:05:42,440 --> 01:05:43,770
Have tea.

598
01:05:48,900 --> 01:05:51,640
Make some excuse.
You have the habit anyway.

599
01:06:03,710 --> 01:06:07,030
Mundu, come here. Come here.

600
01:06:20,130 --> 01:06:23,810
- What are you looking at?
- Nikki, I got it!

601
01:06:24,500 --> 01:06:27,880
- No brother, are you crazy?
- Father.

602
01:06:28,230 --> 01:06:30,160
- He's upstairs.
- What is it?

603
01:06:34,020 --> 01:06:36,240
- Why are you shouting?
- Nothing, father.

604
01:06:36,930 --> 01:06:41,770
Tell him, brother. His professor,
Janaki, wants to meet you.

605
01:06:41,870 --> 01:06:46,190
I don't have time to meet anyone.
Tell him to come and meet me.

606
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:47,640
Okay father.

607
01:06:52,780 --> 01:06:55,300
You! Just you wait!

608
01:06:57,550 --> 01:06:58,650
Father!

609
01:07:10,040 --> 01:07:13,890
Why are you walking so listlessly?
Walk proud. You know how father walks.

610
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:15,656
You're posing as my father.

611
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:18,680
That's the problem.
If he comes to know, he'll kill me.

612
01:07:18,810 --> 01:07:22,740
- How will he know? Come.
- No, I can't do it.

613
01:07:22,990 --> 01:07:25,050
Don't ditch me at the last minute.
Get up.

614
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:30,190
- Hello.
- Hello.

615
01:07:31,550 --> 01:07:34,910
- What's the matter?
- Nothing, father is a little unwell.

616
01:07:35,340 --> 01:07:39,160
Come father, and walk tall!

617
01:07:39,260 --> 01:07:41,256
- Mundu, is everything ready?
- Yes.

618
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:42,920
- Get everything.
- Okay.

619
01:07:43,510 --> 01:07:46,190
- Janaki, where are you?
- Coming father.

620
01:07:46,830 --> 01:07:51,120
Hurry up. They've come.
Arrange for the snacks.

621
01:07:52,430 --> 01:07:57,850
Hello, Anand, you're late.

622
01:07:57,920 --> 01:08:01,480
I told you, father isn't well.
He was resting.

623
01:08:01,530 --> 01:08:03,130
- How is he now?
- He's fine.

624
01:08:03,170 --> 01:08:04,370
Sit down.

625
01:08:05,310 --> 01:08:06,910
What are you doing! Sit up.

626
01:08:16,950 --> 01:08:18,350
Father, speak in Hindi.

627
01:08:21,050 --> 01:08:24,980
I forgot.
Anand speaks very little Tamil.

628
01:08:26,149 --> 01:08:29,999
Even I speak Hindi nowadays.
Even my daughter speaks Hindi.

629
01:08:30,250 --> 01:08:32,100
Hindi is our national language.

630
01:08:33,560 --> 01:08:37,670
- How long have you been here?
- Since one month...

631
01:08:37,850 --> 01:08:39,230
21 years.

632
01:08:43,529 --> 01:08:45,299
Dear, greet him.

633
01:08:47,729 --> 01:08:50,659
- Bless you.
- Please have.

634
01:08:51,399 --> 01:08:54,559
How can I eat so much alone?
I'm sick.

635
01:08:55,460 --> 01:09:03,270
Anand, you eat, eat.
Feel at home, eat.

636
01:09:04,710 --> 01:09:06,010
Have the sweets.

637
01:09:07,490 --> 01:09:09,890
Your son is a very good boy.

638
01:09:10,450 --> 01:09:12,780
I realise why he is so good.

639
01:09:13,410 --> 01:09:16,020
A son takes after his father.

640
01:09:18,470 --> 01:09:21,050
- Father.
- Of course.

641
01:09:23,260 --> 01:09:31,260
I invited you here today. I wanted
to ask you your view on marriage.

642
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:36,540
You'll have to ask that
from my father.

643
01:09:36,580 --> 01:09:41,260
- From your father?
- I mean, his father, that's me.

644
01:09:43,380 --> 01:09:47,420
You're very witty.
I was asking just you.

645
01:09:50,149 --> 01:09:52,429
- What do I say?
- What can I say?

646
01:09:53,540 --> 01:09:57,930
Who am I to interfere?
It's his wish.

647
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:01,700
You're my father.
Your consent is necessary.

648
01:10:01,750 --> 01:10:04,310
- Yes.
- Yes, I give my consent.

649
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:09,340
Everything has been arranged.
We just have to fix the date.

650
01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:14,320
I'll give you, father

651
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:22,280
It'll spill, father.

652
01:10:34,130 --> 01:10:36,470
- It's okay. Mundu!
- Coming.

653
01:10:36,980 --> 01:10:42,430
- I was calling my servant. Mundu!
- I'll clean it, it's like our own home.

654
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:44,790
Yes, why not? Excuse me.

655
01:10:47,660 --> 01:10:50,366
- What's wrong with you?
- You've made me your father.

656
01:10:50,390 --> 01:10:52,160
If he comes to know, he'll kill me.

657
01:10:57,060 --> 01:11:02,750
- Mr. Khanna!
- Subramanium, you live here?

658
01:11:03,060 --> 01:11:07,890
- Yes sir, Please come in.
- Some other time.

659
01:11:07,990 --> 01:11:09,190
Come out!

660
01:11:11,030 --> 01:11:17,710
- At least have coffee.
- Okay. How do I get in?

661
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:19,540
I'll come down.

662
01:11:20,660 --> 01:11:22,730
I'll bring Mr. Khanna upstairs.

663
01:11:31,170 --> 01:11:32,770
- Death has come!
- It's coming up?

664
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:36,680
- Yes.
- I told you not to get me into this!

665
01:11:38,650 --> 01:11:41,366
- What's the matter?
- Father had an attack.

666
01:11:41,390 --> 01:11:43,630
- Father, you've suffered an attack.
- What do we do now?

667
01:11:44,230 --> 01:11:45,830
Let's make him lie down inside.

668
01:11:52,820 --> 01:11:55,810
- Lie down here.
- What's he suffering from?

669
01:11:56,190 --> 01:11:57,710
- Epilepsy.
- Epilepsy?

670
01:11:57,880 --> 01:12:00,606
- It's a dangerous condition.
- I'll call the doctor.

671
01:12:00,630 --> 01:12:02,550
- No, I'll go.
- I'll go!

672
01:12:02,810 --> 01:12:04,860
How can you go, father?
You're sick.

673
01:12:05,060 --> 01:12:07,990
I'll call my family doctor.
He knows his condition.

674
01:12:08,370 --> 01:12:12,470
- How can you leave me alone, son?
- I'll be back soon.

675
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:14,800
You take rest, father.

676
01:12:18,350 --> 01:12:23,820
- Come sir.
- You have a nice house, Subramanium.

677
01:12:23,910 --> 01:12:27,150
Thank you, sir.
This is my daughter's room.

678
01:12:27,210 --> 01:12:30,790
- Okay.
- Come to the drawing room.

679
01:12:30,930 --> 01:12:33,560
- I'll introduce you to someone.
- Sure. Come.

680
01:12:38,040 --> 01:12:43,660
Come sir. Where did they go? Janaki!

681
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:48,590
- Yes?
- Greet him. He's Mr. Khanna.

682
01:12:48,710 --> 01:12:49,906
Bless you.

683
01:12:49,930 --> 01:12:52,406
- His father fell sick.
- Who fell sick?

684
01:12:52,430 --> 01:12:54,376
My daughter's would-be father-in-law.
Did you call the doctor?

685
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:56,480
- He's gone to bring him.
- What's he suffering from?

686
01:12:56,620 --> 01:12:58,220
- Epilepsy.
- Epilepsy?

687
01:12:58,460 --> 01:13:00,900
That can be cured in minutes.
Take me to him.

688
01:13:01,370 --> 01:13:03,650
Janaki, get coffee for sir.

689
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:08,720
It's him.

690
01:13:09,340 --> 01:13:12,320
Mr. Subramanium, there's only
one cure to this.

691
01:13:12,350 --> 01:13:13,800
- What sir?
- Shoe.

692
01:13:14,280 --> 01:13:15,710
- Shoe?
- Yes, get a shoe.

693
01:13:17,770 --> 01:13:21,140
- Here.
- Not Madrasi chappals, Madrasi shoe.

694
01:13:21,320 --> 01:13:25,960
That's the only cure.
Anyway, I'll remove my shoe.

695
01:13:26,170 --> 01:13:29,796
- Sir, slowly.
- I won't hit him with it.

696
01:13:29,820 --> 01:13:32,620
- I only have to make him smell it.
- Swami.

697
01:13:33,650 --> 01:13:35,140
God!

698
01:13:38,320 --> 01:13:43,700
Watch how he recovers in minutes now.
It's a tried and tested cure.

699
01:13:54,130 --> 01:13:57,650
Don't worry, Subramanium.
His seems to be an old ailment.

700
01:13:58,490 --> 01:14:00,190
Or he would have recovered by now.

701
01:14:02,630 --> 01:14:04,220
No problem, we'll wait.

702
01:14:09,890 --> 01:14:12,140
- Mr. Subramanium?
- Yes doctor, he's the patient.

703
01:14:14,840 --> 01:14:16,340
Who put this shoe here?

704
01:14:17,010 --> 01:14:19,400
This is epilepsy.
This is its only cure.

705
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:22,750
What nonsense! Who is he?
Ask him to leave.

706
01:14:22,850 --> 01:14:25,710
Doctor! Do you know
who you're talking to?

707
01:14:26,110 --> 01:14:29,560
I know, but perhaps you don't
know who you're talking to.

708
01:14:29,700 --> 01:14:31,510
I've come across
many doctors like you

709
01:14:31,610 --> 01:14:33,930
And I've come across
many quacks like you.

710
01:14:34,260 --> 01:14:37,746
Do you know, if the patient had
suffocated, you'd be behind bars.

711
01:14:37,770 --> 01:14:38,970
Get lost!

712
01:14:43,390 --> 01:14:45,940
I don't speak Punjabi,
but I do understand it.

713
01:14:48,820 --> 01:14:50,290
Doctor!

714
01:14:50,450 --> 01:14:52,710
I've not come here to fight,
but to cure a patient.

715
01:14:53,330 --> 01:14:57,110
If you want me to save the patient,
ask him to leave.

716
01:14:57,140 --> 01:15:00,500
Who are you to ask me to leave?
I'll leave myself.

717
01:15:01,700 --> 01:15:07,410
- Mr. Khanna! I'm very sorry.
- It's okay, I was leaving anyway.

718
01:15:07,470 --> 01:15:09,420
The doctor has come now.
I'm not required.

719
01:15:10,570 --> 01:15:12,270
I'll see you to the door, sir.

720
01:15:15,090 --> 01:15:18,880
Baby, get a glass of hot water.

721
01:15:34,650 --> 01:15:36,770
Doctor, I'm fine.

722
01:15:39,700 --> 01:15:45,190
- Quick, turn around.
- Doctor, I'm fine.

723
01:15:45,570 --> 01:15:47,720
Don't be afraid.
Didn't you recognise me?

724
01:15:48,970 --> 01:15:50,450
- Master Anand?
- Yes.

725
01:15:51,490 --> 01:15:52,990
- Mr. Khanna has left?
- Yes.

726
01:15:53,050 --> 01:15:55,630
You continue to lie down.
I'll be back.

727
01:15:57,080 --> 01:15:58,400
- Return soon.
- Yes.

728
01:16:06,130 --> 01:16:09,480
I've given him an injection.
He'll be alright now.

729
01:16:09,530 --> 01:16:12,890
Okay doctor, but where is Anand?

730
01:16:12,990 --> 01:16:16,190
I sent him to get some medicine.
He'll be back soon.

731
01:16:19,990 --> 01:16:22,800
I'm their family doctor.
I won't take fees.

732
01:16:24,210 --> 01:16:25,370
Keep it.

733
01:16:36,900 --> 01:16:39,450
- Anand didn't come.
- He's gone to get medicine. He'll come

734
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:43,410
Look what he came for for,
and what has happened.

735
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:46,960
- Did the doctor come?
- Yes, he gave him an injection.

736
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:49,016
- You brought his medicine?
- Yes.

737
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:53,160
But don't bother, I'll take him home.
Father, how are you feeling now?

738
01:16:53,500 --> 01:16:54,996
I was lucky to survive.

739
01:16:55,020 --> 01:16:58,100
It's not right to take him in this
condition. Let him rest here.

740
01:16:58,140 --> 01:16:59,336
Yes, Anand.

741
01:16:59,360 --> 01:17:01,886
No, you don't understand.
His condition is bad. I'll take him home.

742
01:17:01,910 --> 01:17:03,400
I must go home.

743
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:13,790
- Do inform us of his well being.
- Sure.

744
01:17:14,790 --> 01:17:17,530
- Did you pay anything to the doctor?
- It's okay.

745
01:17:17,640 --> 01:17:20,080
He wasn't taking the money,
but I insisted and paid him Rs.15.

746
01:17:20,110 --> 01:17:24,026
Rs.15! That's not done.
Why should you pay?

747
01:17:24,050 --> 01:17:26,380
- No Anand.
- Please don't embarrass me.

748
01:17:26,530 --> 01:17:28,280
- Good day.
- Good day.

749
01:17:38,550 --> 01:17:45,110
Janaki, the face itself
reveals a man's culture.

750
01:17:46,120 --> 01:17:47,920
He seems to be a very good man.

751
01:17:49,100 --> 01:17:51,500
I'm very happy for you.

752
01:18:03,190 --> 01:18:06,340
You? Please come.

753
01:18:07,890 --> 01:18:11,110
- I thought you'd forgotten.
- How's that possible?

754
01:18:11,680 --> 01:18:14,060
There are only a few things
which man remembers in life.

755
01:18:14,700 --> 01:18:18,140
- Didn't Anand give you my message?
- He did.

756
01:18:19,500 --> 01:18:23,210
Please sit down. What will
you have? Tea, or buttermilk?

757
01:18:23,630 --> 01:18:24,730
Whatever.

758
01:18:25,930 --> 01:18:28,000
- Where's your father?
- He'll come now.

759
01:18:28,370 --> 01:18:30,290
He took mother to the Birla Temple.

760
01:18:31,930 --> 01:18:33,710
Sit down. I'll be right back.

761
01:18:50,270 --> 01:18:52,450
What are you studying?

762
01:18:54,230 --> 01:18:57,820
This 'Nikki' written under every
painting, is it your pen name?

763
01:18:59,530 --> 01:19:04,010
I'm the youngest,
so everyone at home calls me Nikki.

764
01:19:05,160 --> 01:19:08,740
Can't outsiders call you Nikki?
Though even Nirmala is a good name.

765
01:19:10,340 --> 01:19:12,060
Call me by whatever name you like.

766
01:19:13,750 --> 01:19:15,900
You sure must have laughed
seeing these pictures.

767
01:19:17,390 --> 01:19:18,790
I don't paint well.

768
01:19:19,830 --> 01:19:22,100
Seeing these paintings, I don't think so.

769
01:19:23,590 --> 01:19:26,360
The imagination a painter should have,
you have that in you.

770
01:19:27,260 --> 01:19:30,690
Father, he is Ashok
who brother mentioned.

771
01:19:31,010 --> 01:19:34,830
Anand was all praise for you.
So, how are you?

772
01:19:35,180 --> 01:19:37,510
I'm fine. How did you find
the Birla Temple?

773
01:19:38,180 --> 01:19:40,800
Temples are always beautiful.

774
01:19:41,350 --> 01:19:43,350
She wanted to see it,
so I took her. Sit down.

775
01:19:46,230 --> 01:19:49,860
Nikki likes to paint.

776
01:19:51,030 --> 01:19:54,580
I wanted to know if
her hobby had any meaning.

777
01:19:55,180 --> 01:20:00,010
Seeing her paintings,
I can say she can be a good painter.

778
01:20:00,540 --> 01:20:03,110
- She only needs practice.
- True.

779
01:20:04,150 --> 01:20:08,800
LF you can spare the time,
why don't you help her practice?

780
01:20:10,200 --> 01:20:14,950
I would, but the work at
Kala Mandir is in full swing.

781
01:20:16,200 --> 01:20:19,590
If it's okay with you,
she can come there.

782
01:20:19,720 --> 01:20:23,760
- She'll learn a lot.
- That's a good idea.

783
01:20:24,330 --> 01:20:25,810
- Alright then...
- You're leaving?

784
01:20:26,060 --> 01:20:30,660
- Yes.
- It's dinner time, have dinner first.

785
01:20:31,290 --> 01:20:32,640
Dinner...

786
01:20:32,890 --> 01:20:36,650
She very rarely invites
someone to dinner. Don't refuse.

787
01:21:38,630 --> 01:21:45,640
Ashok, you have made a beautiful set.
No one can say it's a painting.

788
01:21:46,060 --> 01:21:48,580
It looks real.

789
01:21:48,750 --> 01:21:51,780
Nikki has helped me
a lot in this work.

790
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:53,700
That's obvious.

791
01:21:54,020 --> 01:21:57,516
Even Janaki and Anand have
worked hard at the dance.

792
01:21:57,540 --> 01:22:00,850
God willing, this show will
be a great success.

793
01:22:03,380 --> 01:22:07,020
Oh yes, Ashok;
I came to give you this telegram.

794
01:22:07,660 --> 01:22:11,040
But please finish this work soon.

795
01:22:22,310 --> 01:22:24,980
What is it? ls everything alright?

796
01:22:25,470 --> 01:22:28,550
Father is sick.
He's called me to Calcutta.

797
01:22:31,110 --> 01:22:35,350
- When will you go?
- On tomorrow's train.

798
01:22:38,690 --> 01:22:44,470
Nikki, before leaving for Calcutta,
I want to show you something.

799
01:22:46,670 --> 01:22:48,270
Will you come home with me?

800
01:22:49,460 --> 01:22:50,660
Let's go.

801
01:22:58,550 --> 01:23:04,500
- You have made a lot of paintings.
- I've made them for an exhibition.

802
01:23:05,420 --> 01:23:10,020
Every artist wants to exhibit
his work some day.

803
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:17,950
This painting is beautiful.

804
01:23:25,230 --> 01:23:33,230
And this landscape is so inspiring.
But which one is your favorite?

805
01:23:33,790 --> 01:23:35,710
That's why I've brought you here. Come.

806
01:23:49,410 --> 01:23:53,310
Hey, that's me!

807
01:23:54,130 --> 01:23:56,960
Yes, the way I see you.

808
01:23:57,770 --> 01:24:01,970
But I've never found
myself so beautiful.

809
01:24:03,250 --> 01:24:05,310
It's your hand that's given me
this beautiful look.

810
01:24:06,130 --> 01:24:09,830
The beauty doesn't lie in
a painter's hand, but his heart.

811
01:24:10,790 --> 01:24:15,560
But this jewelry?
I never wear such jewelry.

812
01:24:16,450 --> 01:24:19,050
Is that also the painter's imagination?

813
01:24:19,570 --> 01:24:22,500
Beauty isn't dependent on jewelry.

814
01:24:23,140 --> 01:24:25,380
- But they mean something else.
- What?

815
01:24:34,030 --> 01:24:35,950
My mother is no more.

816
01:24:37,100 --> 01:24:43,990
But she wished for her
daughter-in-law to wear this jewelry.

817
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:03,100
Won't you say anything, Nikki?

818
01:25:15,740 --> 01:25:20,130
If you've taken offense,
I'll brush them off.

819
01:25:42,900 --> 01:25:47,910
- Nikki, I don't like such pranks.
- Why are you sitting glum?

820
01:25:48,270 --> 01:25:52,290
Naturally. Do you know,
Subramanium came here today.

821
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:57,630
- If I wasn't here, he would see you...
- And you would be exposed.

822
01:25:58,050 --> 01:26:03,450
I'd be very pleased! Why don't you
tell Janaki? What's the harm?

823
01:26:04,240 --> 01:26:06,480
- I think that will be right.
- Don't just keep thinking.

824
01:26:07,480 --> 01:26:10,220
Father went to Subramanium's house,
and he came here.

825
01:26:11,280 --> 01:26:12,880
It's difficult to hide this anymore.

826
01:26:13,740 --> 01:26:15,860
I think you should
make things clear today.

827
01:26:16,620 --> 01:26:19,020
- You haven't committed any sin.
- You're right.

828
01:26:20,090 --> 01:26:23,170
We're having the show tonight.
I'll tell Janaki everything there.

829
01:26:23,900 --> 01:26:25,900
After all, the decision
has to be made some day.

830
01:26:33,250 --> 01:26:37,850
- Uncle, you didn't bring aunt along?
- If only she could leave her rosary.

831
01:26:38,770 --> 01:26:40,070
Okay. Sit down.

832
01:26:44,580 --> 01:26:47,980
- Greetings father.
- Greetings.

833
01:26:48,200 --> 01:26:53,100
How can the family sit
so far in the back?

834
01:26:53,390 --> 01:26:55,360
Come with me.

835
01:27:04,680 --> 01:27:08,290
He's our professor.
And he's Anand's father, Mr. Kumarswami.

836
01:27:11,460 --> 01:27:14,310
- We should worship you.
- No!

837
01:27:16,500 --> 01:27:17,770
Sit down.

838
01:27:19,880 --> 01:27:22,900
Janaki, we'll be late. Hurry up.

839
01:27:25,200 --> 01:27:27,860
Some cold drinks?
You must take something.

840
01:27:27,890 --> 01:27:32,120
Boy! Here.

841
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:39,570
Excuse me, I'll be back.

842
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:47,050
- Janaki, you haven't dressed yet?
- Anand, you're strange.

843
01:27:47,240 --> 01:27:50,090
- You made father sit in back.
- Father? What rubbish

844
01:27:50,190 --> 01:27:51,990
Yes, I just moved him to the front.

845
01:27:57,670 --> 01:27:58,970
- I'm going.
- Janaki...

846
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:00,700
I want to tell you something important.

847
01:28:00,750 --> 01:28:04,050
Later. There's just five minutes until
the show, and I have to get dressed yet.

848
01:28:04,150 --> 01:28:06,600
Don't leave after this show.
I can't delay this any longer.

849
01:28:06,650 --> 01:28:07,950
Alright, I won't.

850
01:28:11,870 --> 01:28:15,026
- Sadhuram, have you got a seat?
- Yes Janaki gave me a seat.

851
01:28:15,050 --> 01:28:16,890
Sit down. The show's about to begin.

852
01:28:17,830 --> 01:28:22,430
Excuse me, meet him. He is
Mr. Daulatram, my senior manager.

853
01:28:23,020 --> 01:28:28,140
He's Sadhuram.
His oil is supplied to your home.

854
01:28:29,760 --> 01:28:32,610
Your oil is excellent.
It's just like home-made.

855
01:28:33,930 --> 01:28:35,330
It is home-made.

856
01:28:36,190 --> 01:28:38,680
Mr. Murlidhar, give him a good seat.

857
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:42,860
Mr. Subramanium, it's difficult
to get two seats together.

858
01:28:43,170 --> 01:28:45,336
Though I'll give him a very good seat.

859
01:28:45,360 --> 01:28:47,350
Mr. Khanna, go and sit in the front.

860
01:28:47,420 --> 01:28:49,410
No, this one is fine.

861
01:28:50,720 --> 01:28:54,290
Come, I'll give you a very good seat.

862
01:28:56,490 --> 01:29:00,440
Sit down. You'll get a
good view of the show from here.

863
01:29:02,910 --> 01:29:06,170
- Mr. Kumarswami! Hello.
- Hello.

864
01:29:06,250 --> 01:29:08,180
It's so good of you to have come.

865
01:29:51,210 --> 01:29:53,100
Oh woman with attitude

866
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:06,310
But she looks so innocent

867
01:30:09,290 --> 01:30:13,560
These unknown girls enchant the heart

868
01:30:18,270 --> 01:30:20,030
They're evil-hearted

869
01:30:22,830 --> 01:30:29,140
She was a different woman,
who met my eyes and captured my heart

870
01:31:05,810 --> 01:31:09,320
Oh cruel one, oh betrayer

871
01:31:10,370 --> 01:31:14,050
At least tell me something about yourself

872
01:31:17,070 --> 01:31:20,810
My restlessness...

873
01:31:21,680 --> 01:31:25,580
let it lower a little.
At least smile at me again

874
01:31:28,420 --> 01:31:34,410
She was a different woman,
who met my eyes and captured my heart

875
01:32:28,170 --> 01:32:32,160
Life is beautiful. Enjoy love

876
01:32:36,640 --> 01:32:40,830
When one heart loves another,
why fear the world?

877
01:32:45,220 --> 01:32:49,420
Life is beautiful. Enjoy love

878
01:33:14,810 --> 01:33:19,220
I was silent. Even you were quiet

879
01:33:23,720 --> 01:33:27,910
But the eyes said it all

880
01:33:32,390 --> 01:33:36,490
I accepted my admirer

881
01:33:43,840 --> 01:33:47,880
Life is beautiful. Enjoy love

882
01:34:34,860 --> 01:34:39,340
I dance, so does my heart...

883
01:34:43,780 --> 01:34:47,990
and the whole world dances with me

884
01:34:52,580 --> 01:34:56,570
There's happiness all around

885
01:35:03,690 --> 01:35:07,720
Life is beautiful. Enjoy love

886
01:36:36,480 --> 01:36:43,940
Friends, I thank you on behalf of
Kala Mandir for this applause.

887
01:36:44,510 --> 01:36:49,930
Actually, the credit for the success
of today's show goes to these youths.

888
01:36:50,510 --> 01:36:54,280
You will be
even more pleased to know...

889
01:36:54,520 --> 01:36:59,260
that their fathers, who have
sired such talented children...

890
01:36:59,520 --> 01:37:00,920
are present here today.

891
01:37:01,360 --> 01:37:06,030
I consider it my duty
to introduce them to you.

892
01:37:06,830 --> 01:37:09,370
Come, Mr. Subramanium.

893
01:37:11,310 --> 01:37:14,350
Yes, you also come on stage.

894
01:37:15,420 --> 01:37:17,460
- Come.
- No, I'm fine here.

895
01:37:20,190 --> 01:37:21,390
Please come.

896
01:37:28,640 --> 01:37:33,420
He is Janaki's father, Mr. Subramanium.

897
01:37:39,450 --> 01:37:43,960
And he is Anand's father,
Mr. Kumarswami.

898
01:37:48,950 --> 01:37:50,590
- Father!
- What is it, son?

899
01:37:55,130 --> 01:38:01,940
Come Mr. Khanna. He is my would-be
son-in-law, and his father...

900
01:38:02,020 --> 01:38:05,270
Subramanium!
What kind of a joke is this?

901
01:38:05,930 --> 01:38:08,130
He's MY son,
and he's my servant.

902
01:38:11,320 --> 01:38:13,510
Why you rascal, are you his father?

903
01:38:23,230 --> 01:38:25,486
- Is this true?
- Yes, no.

904
01:38:25,510 --> 01:38:28,890
- I have understood. Come Janaki!
- Janaki listen!

905
01:38:33,790 --> 01:38:38,830
What is all this?
Drop the curtain!

906
01:38:41,250 --> 01:38:43,240
Kumarswami, Mr. Khanna...

907
01:38:46,860 --> 01:38:48,510
Have you gone crazy?

908
01:38:53,460 --> 01:38:54,656
The curtain!

909
01:38:54,680 --> 01:38:57,200
As soon as I got to know you,
I got to know your father's views.

910
01:38:57,470 --> 01:38:59,470
I didn't have the courage
to tell him the truth...

911
01:38:59,600 --> 01:39:03,530
- for fear that I might lose you.
- But why didn't you tell me?

912
01:39:04,470 --> 01:39:05,970
Didn't you trust me, either?

913
01:39:06,270 --> 01:39:09,360
It's what I wanted to tell you
before the show, but you were in a hurry.

914
01:39:10,060 --> 01:39:13,950
How was I to know destiny would
play such a cruel joke on us?

915
01:39:15,400 --> 01:39:20,330
Does my being a Punjabi
make any difference to you?

916
01:39:21,940 --> 01:39:26,560
What nonsense are you talking?
One human loves another.

917
01:39:27,740 --> 01:39:30,710
But it's made a lot of
difference to others.

918
01:39:31,790 --> 01:39:35,780
Father says even I've
cheated him, along with you.

919
01:39:37,830 --> 01:39:41,880
I know. You had to
suffer this because of me.

920
01:39:42,900 --> 01:39:44,800
But what do I do? It's my fate.

921
01:39:46,110 --> 01:39:48,340
Today, my family, outsiders,
everyone hates me.

922
01:39:49,980 --> 01:39:51,610
I don't hate you.

923
01:39:52,760 --> 01:39:56,110
I realise what you've done for me.

924
01:39:56,910 --> 01:40:01,460
Really Janaki? If you're with me,
I don't care about anyone else.

925
01:40:02,260 --> 01:40:05,040
We'll face any difficulties together.

926
01:40:14,450 --> 01:40:16,180
So that you see the boy yourself.

927
01:40:18,210 --> 01:40:20,850
- He's educated.
- Works as a clerk in a bank.

928
01:40:20,890 --> 01:40:25,016
- He draws a good salary.
- I even get children's allowance.

929
01:40:25,040 --> 01:40:27,880
Okay. I didn't need to see the boy.

930
01:40:28,130 --> 01:40:31,460
We share the same caste.
Even their horoscopes match.

931
01:40:32,330 --> 01:40:37,370
If I can get a son-in-law who works
abroad, I can't get luckier than that.

932
01:40:37,610 --> 01:40:40,700
I fix my daughter's alliance
with your son.

933
01:40:41,220 --> 01:40:44,700
- We only need to fix a date.
- I've already done that.

934
01:40:44,980 --> 01:40:47,410
The priest has given
the date of 15th December.

935
01:40:47,660 --> 01:40:50,070
15th December? So soon?

936
01:40:51,060 --> 01:40:53,970
Daughters have
to be given away anyway.

937
01:40:54,150 --> 01:40:57,860
I wish to get her married
as soon as possible.

938
01:40:58,030 --> 01:41:01,980
Alright, we don't mind.

939
01:41:06,690 --> 01:41:08,150
- Good day.
- Good day.

940
01:41:09,090 --> 01:41:10,290
Bless you.

941
01:41:26,010 --> 01:41:30,180
- Father, were you arranging my marriage?
- Whose else?

942
01:41:31,160 --> 01:41:35,780
- The boy is good, he's educated.
- You should have at least asked me.

943
01:41:37,050 --> 01:41:40,800
Ask you? I saw what you did.

944
01:41:41,640 --> 01:41:45,320
It was good many people didn't know,
or no one would marry you.

945
01:41:45,700 --> 01:41:47,720
But father,
it's a question of my life.

946
01:41:48,030 --> 01:41:52,080
A woman has to follow her
parents' wishes before marriage...

947
01:41:52,300 --> 01:41:54,370
and serve her husband after marriage.

948
01:41:56,290 --> 01:41:59,310
Hereafter, if you step out of the
house, you've had it!

949
01:41:59,580 --> 01:42:00,766
So beware!

950
01:42:00,790 --> 01:42:05,550
But father, just think. I don't know
the guy. Who he is? What's he like?

951
01:42:05,610 --> 01:42:08,700
However he is,
he's better than that cheat.

952
01:42:09,240 --> 01:42:13,600
He's no comparison to us.
He's Punjabi, we're Madrasi.

953
01:42:13,810 --> 01:42:15,310
We have nothing in common.

954
01:42:15,810 --> 01:42:19,190
He's Punjabi, we're Madrasi.
We have nothing in common.

955
01:42:19,220 --> 01:42:24,510
Sardarilal, even I accept that.
But that incident is over.

956
01:42:24,790 --> 01:42:27,800
The boy was making a mistake.
I pulled him over.

957
01:42:28,230 --> 01:42:32,960
Lalaji is such an important man.
His is a renowned family.

958
01:42:33,790 --> 01:42:36,560
Your daughter's proposal
has been sent to them.

959
01:42:36,920 --> 01:42:38,416
We're very happy about it.

960
01:42:38,440 --> 01:42:41,870
But if this matter reaches their ears,
it can have such a bad effect.

961
01:42:42,500 --> 01:42:46,030
I agree.
No decent man will tolerate this.

962
01:42:46,480 --> 01:42:48,176
I myself am
concerned about my honor.

963
01:42:48,200 --> 01:42:53,606
This isn't just a question of your honor,
but the honor of the whole clan.

964
01:42:53,630 --> 01:42:56,250
Where am I denying it?

965
01:42:56,760 --> 01:43:00,940
I can leave my son for the clan,
not leave the clan for the son.

966
01:43:01,140 --> 01:43:05,130
That is what we expected of you.
After all, the clan is important.

967
01:43:05,610 --> 01:43:09,860
What can a lone man do? It's the
clan that helps when one is in need.

968
01:43:10,270 --> 01:43:12,310
- Right Kanhaiyalal?
- Of course.

969
01:43:12,490 --> 01:43:14,700
Mr. Kapoor,
do you have any complaints now?

970
01:43:15,310 --> 01:43:21,370
Why should I? What I didn't approve, I
came and told you considering it my duty.

971
01:43:21,480 --> 01:43:26,490
- Okay Daulatram, excuse the bother.
- It was no bother.

972
01:43:27,060 --> 01:43:30,710
I'm pleased to know you
all care so much for me.

973
01:43:31,320 --> 01:43:33,140
We caution our dear ones,
not strangers.

974
01:43:33,250 --> 01:43:37,430
Come on now. It was our duty.

975
01:43:38,170 --> 01:43:40,880
- Good day.
- Good day.

976
01:43:58,570 --> 01:44:00,770
If you don't have a child,
it's just one sorrow.

977
01:44:03,370 --> 01:44:05,680
If you have him and he dies,
you have immense sorrow.

978
01:44:08,120 --> 01:44:13,310
But if you have him and he's worthless,
there's no dearth of sorrow.

979
01:44:14,430 --> 01:44:18,120
- I haven't committed a murder, father.
- That would have been better.

980
01:44:18,700 --> 01:44:21,020
You would be hanged.
We would cry and forget about it.

981
01:44:22,320 --> 01:44:28,280
Today, because of you, those I had
never met, I had to bow before them.

982
01:44:28,800 --> 01:44:30,800
Why do you attach so much
importance to the clan?

983
01:44:30,850 --> 01:44:32,550
What do you know of its importance?

984
01:44:32,710 --> 01:44:34,310
You can't do anything without them.

985
01:44:34,820 --> 01:44:37,260
The world is not so crazy
as to care so much about their clan.

986
01:44:37,690 --> 01:44:40,020
Foolish, good for nothing fellow!

987
01:44:43,530 --> 01:44:45,900
- Mom, what father said...
- He's right.

988
01:44:46,550 --> 01:44:50,040
You won't understand. One doesn't
get good proposals again and again.

989
01:44:50,570 --> 01:44:54,190
Do you know, your act
can stall your sister's marriage.

990
01:44:54,700 --> 01:44:58,310
If you don't care for us,
at least think of your sister.

991
01:45:18,020 --> 01:45:23,520
Don't worry Nikki.
Your brother won't do anything...

992
01:45:24,560 --> 01:45:26,190
that will affect your life.

993
01:45:41,270 --> 01:45:43,930
- Hello.
- Good you came, Anand.

994
01:45:44,140 --> 01:45:46,040
I was coming to meet you myself.
Come here.

995
01:45:48,680 --> 01:45:50,690
- What's happened?
- It's an emergency.

996
01:45:51,130 --> 01:45:52,330
What emergency?

997
01:45:52,980 --> 01:45:55,940
- Father has arranged my marriage.
- Your marriage?

998
01:45:56,580 --> 01:45:58,490
Yes Anand, to a boy of our caste.

999
01:45:59,640 --> 01:46:01,310
You'll have to find a way soon.

1000
01:46:08,550 --> 01:46:13,460
- Why are you silent?
- Because I can't think of anything.

1001
01:46:15,080 --> 01:46:18,800
Even my father has fixed Nikki's
alliance with a rich Punjabi family.

1002
01:46:20,020 --> 01:46:21,890
Any step we take
can break this alliance.

1003
01:46:28,400 --> 01:46:32,340
Nikki must get married. You don't
care whether I live or die.

1004
01:46:32,890 --> 01:46:37,270
Don't think like that, Janaki. I want
you to convince your father somehow.

1005
01:46:37,890 --> 01:46:43,510
It's just a matter of few months.
They'll pass quickly.

1006
01:46:44,130 --> 01:46:48,240
They won't.
When will they? After my marriage?

1007
01:46:48,970 --> 01:46:50,570
Father has even set the date.

1008
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:54,900
No, that's unfair!
You must raise your voice against it.

1009
01:46:55,230 --> 01:46:56,730
And you should do nothing?

1010
01:46:57,380 --> 01:47:00,770
You want me to go
against my father...

1011
01:47:01,610 --> 01:47:04,450
while you remain an
obedient son in your family.

1012
01:47:04,720 --> 01:47:09,250
- No Janaki, you don't know how much...
- You love me?

1013
01:47:09,570 --> 01:47:13,830
- I didn't know before. I do now.
- Try to understand me, Janaki.

1014
01:47:14,370 --> 01:47:17,890
- I'm not a coward, I'm helpless.
- They are no different for me.

1015
01:47:19,810 --> 01:47:22,920
What I regret is becoming
so crazy about you.

1016
01:47:23,660 --> 01:47:26,570
I didn't understand you.
I let you play with my life.

1017
01:47:26,820 --> 01:47:29,330
- I never played with your life, Janaki.
- You are even now.

1018
01:47:29,700 --> 01:47:31,500
- Janaki...
- Move Anand, let me go.

1019
01:47:32,330 --> 01:47:34,280
Try to forget me if you can.

1020
01:47:41,460 --> 01:47:44,390
Janaki, I'm very annoyed with you.

1021
01:47:45,110 --> 01:47:47,160
Even God is annoyed with me, uncle.

1022
01:47:47,900 --> 01:47:49,420
What's this? You're crying?

1023
01:47:50,160 --> 01:47:55,360
- No uncle, there's something in my eye.
- In both your eyes?

1024
01:47:55,570 --> 01:47:58,050
You're fooling me? Come here.

1025
01:48:04,970 --> 01:48:08,650
I never treated you any
different from my niece.

1026
01:48:09,170 --> 01:48:12,410
What I regret is that
you considered me a stranger.

1027
01:48:13,480 --> 01:48:15,720
- What are you saying?
- The truth.

1028
01:48:15,910 --> 01:48:19,180
If you considered me dear,
wouldn't you tell me your sorrows?

1029
01:48:19,920 --> 01:48:22,990
- What is this I'm hearing?
- You have heard right.

1030
01:48:25,260 --> 01:48:30,840
- I'm getting married.
- And what does Anand have to say?

1031
01:48:32,290 --> 01:48:35,940
He is helpless, because of his clan.

1032
01:48:37,390 --> 01:48:41,660
- Clan indeed!
- I have just one option now.

1033
01:48:43,640 --> 01:48:49,290
All my problems will be over
if I kill myself.

1034
01:48:49,430 --> 01:48:52,360
What nonsense are you talking!
Don't you dare say that again.

1035
01:48:53,010 --> 01:48:54,210
Crazy girl.

1036
01:49:12,060 --> 01:49:13,790
Madam, have dinner.

1037
01:49:18,370 --> 01:49:19,770
Madam, have dinner.

1038
01:49:22,380 --> 01:49:26,820
- Did father eat?
- I did serve him, but he refused.

1039
01:49:51,990 --> 01:49:53,290
Have dinner, father.

1040
01:49:56,630 --> 01:49:58,150
I prepared it myself.

1041
01:50:12,060 --> 01:50:14,390
I, I...

1042
01:50:14,760 --> 01:50:18,370
You went to meet that cheat again?
Why didn't you die when you were born?

1043
01:50:20,520 --> 01:50:22,720
- Father!
- Don't you call me father!

1044
01:50:25,050 --> 01:50:29,470
- What have I done?
- What else have you left to do?

1045
01:50:29,830 --> 01:50:31,630
It would be better if you had died.

1046
01:50:32,500 --> 01:50:34,690
I'll assume I have no daughter.

1047
01:50:36,600 --> 01:50:38,330
Get out of my sight!

1048
01:51:17,080 --> 01:51:21,780
Dear father, I have hurt you terribly.

1049
01:51:22,830 --> 01:51:24,520
I apologise for it.

1050
01:51:25,640 --> 01:51:31,550
When man loses all support,
he has only God to turn to.

1051
01:51:32,710 --> 01:51:35,490
Even I have only him to turn to.

1052
01:51:36,530 --> 01:51:41,180
As you said,
I am going to kill myself.

1053
01:51:42,240 --> 01:51:46,310
I pray you will be free of all
sorrow after my death.

1054
01:51:47,290 --> 01:51:48,810
Your unfortunate daughter.

1055
01:52:36,050 --> 01:52:39,210
- Uncle.
- Yes. I knew what was on your mind.

1056
01:52:40,450 --> 01:52:43,640
It is cowardice to run away from life.

1057
01:52:45,870 --> 01:52:50,080
But what can the one
who has been left alone do?

1058
01:52:50,810 --> 01:52:54,930
Crazy girl! As long as your uncle is alive,
how can you be alone?

1059
01:52:55,320 --> 01:53:01,080
Sadhuram, I considered Subramanium
a national minded man.

1060
01:53:01,390 --> 01:53:06,630
I will teach Subramanium
a very good lesson!

1061
01:53:07,460 --> 01:53:09,900
- Come to my house.
- Come dear.

1062
01:53:12,530 --> 01:53:14,370
Whatever God willed.

1063
01:53:28,960 --> 01:53:33,280
Daughter! What have you done!

1064
01:53:35,510 --> 01:53:42,170
Murlidhar, I'm a killer.
I killed my daughter.

1065
01:53:42,720 --> 01:53:45,690
I wonder what got into me.

1066
01:53:46,080 --> 01:53:47,580
Calm down, Subramanium.

1067
01:53:48,340 --> 01:53:52,600
You didn't know a few words
would lead to this.

1068
01:53:53,230 --> 01:53:56,530
No one can do anything
against God's will.

1069
01:53:56,690 --> 01:54:00,820
She's returned back
to where she came from.

1070
01:54:02,290 --> 01:54:05,930
Everything is as it was,
except Janaki is not with us.

1071
01:54:08,560 --> 01:54:10,980
Get up, Subramanium.

1072
01:54:17,660 --> 01:54:20,130
Who can go against what is destined?

1073
01:54:22,370 --> 01:54:23,470
Son!

1074
01:54:32,820 --> 01:54:37,620
Who expected this to happen?

1075
01:54:47,970 --> 01:54:52,860
- Mohini, get a pen and ink.
- Yes uncle.

1076
01:55:08,070 --> 01:55:11,350
How many times have I told you
that you're my sister's daughter now?

1077
01:55:11,660 --> 01:55:13,980
Call me Mama (mother's brother).
Don't call me uncle.

1078
01:55:14,130 --> 01:55:18,660
- Yes, Mama. Sorry, I made a mistake.
- Don't make the mistake again.

1079
01:55:20,530 --> 01:55:23,710
One mistake by Subramanium
has shocked him.

1080
01:55:25,610 --> 01:55:28,890
How is father now?
Did you meet him today?

1081
01:55:29,580 --> 01:55:33,700
Since we have begun this game,
I meet him often.

1082
01:55:34,180 --> 01:55:38,230
He is slowly gathering himself.
He even went to the office today.

1083
01:55:38,840 --> 01:55:40,040
- Really?
- Yes.

1084
01:55:40,200 --> 01:55:43,410
Though to reassure you,
I have called him here.

1085
01:55:43,700 --> 01:55:45,100
Maybe he comes today.

1086
01:55:45,700 --> 01:55:50,410
But Mama, my death must
have shocked father immensely.

1087
01:55:52,020 --> 01:55:53,860
He loved me so much.

1088
01:55:55,600 --> 01:55:58,030
Just thinking of it
makes my heart shudder.

1089
01:55:58,660 --> 01:56:01,990
But we've done this to shock him.

1090
01:56:02,690 --> 01:56:05,410
A patient doesn't know of his disease.

1091
01:56:05,750 --> 01:56:08,950
They doctor only has to
gather courage and do the operation.

1092
01:56:09,500 --> 01:56:13,160
- Lalaji, Mr. Subramanium has come.
- Send him here.

1093
01:56:14,180 --> 01:56:18,630
Look Mohini, don't do anything in your
excitement that spoils the whole plan.

1094
01:56:18,670 --> 01:56:20,170
- No uncle.
- Again!

1095
01:56:20,420 --> 01:56:22,770
- Mama, don't worry.
- How can I not worry?

1096
01:56:22,880 --> 01:56:24,860
Go prepare a plate for your father, too.

1097
01:56:29,780 --> 01:56:31,840
Come Subramanium.

1098
01:56:36,860 --> 01:56:38,360
Coming straight from the office?

1099
01:56:40,570 --> 01:56:42,170
Will you take coffee, or dinner?

1100
01:56:42,880 --> 01:56:44,780
I don't feel like
having anything right now.

1101
01:56:45,120 --> 01:56:51,790
You must have something. Mohini, get
something to eat for your Madrasi uncle

1102
01:56:52,150 --> 01:56:57,300
Don't call me Madrasi.
This word hits me hard.

1103
01:56:59,340 --> 01:57:05,030
The pride of being a Madrasi
snatched my daughter from me forever.

1104
01:57:09,950 --> 01:57:14,140
Bring it, dear.
Put it here on the table.

1105
01:57:18,620 --> 01:57:21,270
She is my niece.
She has just come from Punjab.

1106
01:57:22,860 --> 01:57:24,530
- Sit down, dear.
- Bless you, dear.

1107
01:57:27,870 --> 01:57:33,910
Bless you. Even Janaki had
served me dinner with as much love.

1108
01:57:36,490 --> 01:57:39,010
And I threw the plate.

1109
01:57:42,060 --> 01:57:46,210
- What happened to me, Sadhuram?
- Gather yourself, Subramanium.

1110
01:57:46,590 --> 01:57:49,450
She is also like your daughter.
Consider her your daughter.

1111
01:57:50,460 --> 01:57:52,650
Eat, your dinner is getting cold.

1112
01:57:59,220 --> 01:58:03,700
Subramanium, why don't you come here
in the evenings to spend time?

1113
01:58:04,050 --> 01:58:05,550
Even this is your home.

1114
01:58:07,070 --> 01:58:10,140
Okay, I'll come.

1115
01:58:11,390 --> 01:58:12,490
Eat.

1116
01:58:39,760 --> 01:58:42,810
- Watch where you're going.?
- I'm sorry.

1117
01:59:22,440 --> 01:59:27,590
Why are you after me?

1118
01:59:28,190 --> 01:59:34,430
- I, I...
- I indeed!

1119
01:59:34,750 --> 01:59:39,180
- Mama!
- Mohini? What is it?

1120
01:59:39,370 --> 01:59:44,530
- Some deadbeat is after me.
- Who's he?

1121
01:59:44,840 --> 01:59:48,970
- Anand! Come. Where's the deadbeat?
- He's the one.

1122
01:59:49,530 --> 01:59:51,410
He keeps staring at me.

1123
01:59:53,080 --> 01:59:55,790
I know him. He's Daulatram's son.

1124
01:59:56,150 --> 01:59:58,190
- She's my niece, Mohini.
- Hello.

1125
01:59:59,500 --> 02:00:02,820
Don't let her words offend you.
She has just come from the village.

1126
02:00:03,430 --> 02:00:07,610
- How come you're here today?
- I was going to college.

1127
02:00:07,870 --> 02:00:09,670
I thought I'd greet you
on the way.

1128
02:00:09,710 --> 02:00:12,600
Greetings.
You sometimes act far sighted.

1129
02:00:12,690 --> 02:00:15,500
- Come in.
- No, I'm going to college now.

1130
02:00:15,680 --> 02:00:18,740
- I'll come some other time.
- Okay. Where had you gone?

1131
02:00:18,910 --> 02:00:21,690
Your mother was worried if you
had forgotten the way.

1132
02:00:21,780 --> 02:00:22,980
Come inside.

1133
02:00:34,090 --> 02:00:35,550
Give me an answer.

1134
02:00:37,710 --> 02:00:42,130
Mr. Murlidhar, it's better if you
don't include me in this program.

1135
02:00:43,620 --> 02:00:47,470
If anyone recognizes me,
our whole plan will be foiled.

1136
02:00:48,740 --> 02:00:51,430
You're worrying needlessly.

1137
02:00:51,970 --> 02:00:55,760
You became a Punjabi from a Madrasi,
and even Anand couldn't recognise you.

1138
02:00:56,130 --> 02:01:00,630
Can't we present you on stage,
so that no one recognizes you?

1139
02:01:01,020 --> 02:01:07,310
Murlidhar, assuming yourself to be
smart and others to be fools...

1140
02:01:07,750 --> 02:01:09,550
is a signal of bad times to come.

1141
02:01:10,310 --> 02:01:16,390
You're speaking as if I'll
amass huge wealth from this show.

1142
02:01:16,860 --> 02:01:21,700
Since you spread the rumor of
Janaki's death, half my students quit.

1143
02:01:22,180 --> 02:01:27,590
If she doesn't come, if she doesn't
do shows, how will the institution run?

1144
02:01:27,940 --> 02:01:35,150
Though it isn't my property,
I don't care if it is shut down.

1145
02:01:35,230 --> 02:01:41,510
Murlidhar, even I don't want
such a big institution to be shut down.

1146
02:01:41,930 --> 02:01:44,470
I was only concerned for her.

1147
02:01:44,870 --> 02:01:50,530
She is as dear to me
as she is to you.

1148
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:52,830
Then do whatever you deem fit.

1149
02:01:53,740 --> 02:01:55,240
What do you say, Janaki?

1150
02:01:58,100 --> 02:02:03,220
- If there is no other way, then okay.
- That's better.

1151
02:02:08,830 --> 02:02:13,210
Murlidhar is one persistent man.

1152
02:02:14,120 --> 02:02:16,670
Why are you
participating in the show?

1153
02:02:17,040 --> 02:02:22,590
I am scared. I fooled the
whole world and made you Punjabi.

1154
02:02:22,940 --> 02:02:25,680
Don't become Madrasi
again before marriage.

1155
02:02:25,920 --> 02:02:29,650
But the way I'll go on stage,
even you won't recognise me, uncle.

1156
02:02:29,770 --> 02:02:31,070
Not uncle, Mama!

1157
02:02:33,370 --> 02:02:36,240
Uncle? Mama?

1158
02:03:04,050 --> 02:03:06,706
I fell in love with you, darling

1159
02:03:06,730 --> 02:03:09,406
I knowingly put myself in trouble, love

1160
02:03:09,430 --> 02:03:14,710
I'm doomed in your love, oh cruel one

1161
02:04:00,700 --> 02:04:05,870
You have the
promise of the fair moon

1162
02:04:06,150 --> 02:04:11,010
Oh my Prince, come back

1163
02:04:16,970 --> 02:04:22,240
The colorful meeting
of our first meeting

1164
02:04:22,350 --> 02:04:27,550
How do I forget it?
Please tell me, love

1165
02:04:38,280 --> 02:04:41,046
The weather has changed

1166
02:04:41,070 --> 02:04:43,730
I knowingly put myself in
trouble, love

1167
02:04:43,820 --> 02:04:49,470
I'm doomed in your love, oh cruel one

1168
02:05:31,390 --> 02:05:38,120
When the twinkling stars
beckon in the middle of the night

1169
02:05:49,030 --> 02:05:55,990
I sit up and
recollect your every word

1170
02:06:06,490 --> 02:06:09,240
I haven't slept for so long

1171
02:06:09,300 --> 02:06:12,016
I knowingly put myself in
trouble, love

1172
02:06:12,040 --> 02:06:17,240
I'm doomed in your love, oh cruel one

1173
02:07:03,630 --> 02:07:08,510
He went to the market

1174
02:07:09,200 --> 02:07:12,510
And bought a stick

1175
02:07:13,910 --> 02:07:17,420
My love is love, darling

1176
02:07:22,130 --> 02:07:25,220
But your intentions are wrong

1177
02:07:53,980 --> 02:07:58,610
He went to the market

1178
02:07:59,300 --> 02:08:03,070
And bought grapes

1179
02:08:04,090 --> 02:08:07,500
I have understood you

1180
02:08:12,340 --> 02:08:15,530
But you don't recognise me

1181
02:08:44,590 --> 02:08:49,040
We went to the market

1182
02:08:49,690 --> 02:08:52,360
- And he bought...
- What?

1183
02:08:52,870 --> 02:08:55,930
He bought fritters

1184
02:08:56,700 --> 02:08:59,250
You will come some day

1185
02:09:04,040 --> 02:09:07,250
Drawn by my love

1186
02:09:42,010 --> 02:09:45,410
- There's no need to do that now.
- Why Mama?

1187
02:09:48,190 --> 02:09:49,920
Not Mama, Uncle.

1188
02:10:16,860 --> 02:10:20,160
- Janaki, you're alive!
- Yes Anand, I'm alive.

1189
02:10:35,160 --> 02:10:39,780
- Are you angry with me?
- Why did you do this, Janaki?

1190
02:10:40,440 --> 02:10:42,140
Why did you punish me so severely?

1191
02:10:43,750 --> 02:10:45,970
I had gone to punish myself.

1192
02:10:47,120 --> 02:10:52,600
Had Sadhuram not come between my
life and death, we would never meet.

1193
02:10:53,220 --> 02:10:57,010
Don't say that, Janaki.
I was a coward until today.

1194
02:10:57,680 --> 02:11:00,120
But nothing can separate us now.

1195
02:11:00,960 --> 02:11:03,090
I am ready to
fight every storm today.

1196
02:11:06,040 --> 02:11:09,220
Not Mohini Sadhuram, call her Janaki.

1197
02:11:10,060 --> 02:11:14,440
So you have come to know.
Good. Even I wanted that.

1198
02:11:14,910 --> 02:11:17,520
But keep this secret to yourself.

1199
02:11:18,010 --> 02:11:21,890
I'll meet with Daulatram tomorrow
to discuss your marriage.

1200
02:11:22,040 --> 02:11:24,640
I'll break his pride
and make him chew his own words.

1201
02:11:32,760 --> 02:11:35,750
- Tell me, Sadhuram.
- What else can I say?

1202
02:11:36,480 --> 02:11:41,340
Since my brother-in-law expired,
this responsibility has fallen on me

1203
02:11:42,230 --> 02:11:47,070
She is the daughter of Kapoors.
She belongs to a good family.

1204
02:11:47,640 --> 02:11:51,160
I'd be pleased if she can become
your daughter-in-law.

1205
02:11:52,250 --> 02:11:55,240
Sadhuram, it is difficult to get
girls from such good families.

1206
02:11:55,960 --> 02:11:58,540
Where money is concerned,
I don't give it much importance.

1207
02:11:59,440 --> 02:12:02,120
Wife, why are you quiet?
You also say something.

1208
02:12:02,290 --> 02:12:04,620
What do I say?
Whatever you like, I like.

1209
02:12:05,640 --> 02:12:09,090
Why don't you two
come and see the girl?

1210
02:12:09,380 --> 02:12:11,490
The girl and her mother
are staying at my place.

1211
02:12:11,580 --> 02:12:14,650
No, you don't
see decent girls like that.

1212
02:12:15,130 --> 02:12:16,730
Even I have a grown-up daughter.

1213
02:12:17,270 --> 02:12:19,350
Anand's mother will come
and see her some day.

1214
02:12:19,950 --> 02:12:22,430
What's the harm?
You come along, too.

1215
02:12:22,960 --> 02:12:25,200
Okay, as you wish. I'll come, too.

1216
02:12:25,720 --> 02:12:28,830
- At least have buttermilk.
- No thank you.

1217
02:12:29,370 --> 02:12:32,576
How can I drink buttermilk
in your home?

1218
02:12:32,600 --> 02:12:34,650
Come on, drink.
You can pay me for it.

1219
02:12:36,450 --> 02:12:37,550
Drink.

1220
02:12:40,010 --> 02:12:43,330
I'll drink it,
but please keep it to yourself.

1221
02:12:44,680 --> 02:12:46,480
Don't worry. We won't tell anyone.

1222
02:12:51,380 --> 02:12:55,060
What will you lose? You have
to act her mother for some time.

1223
02:12:55,390 --> 02:12:58,200
You won't lose anything,
and her work will be done.

1224
02:12:58,640 --> 02:13:04,920
Sadhu, don't drag me into this sin.
I won't do this bad deed.

1225
02:13:05,250 --> 02:13:11,140
Come on, sister. What better deed
than to bring someone happiness?

1226
02:13:11,610 --> 02:13:15,780
All your good deeds are no comparison
to helping this poor girl.

1227
02:13:16,090 --> 02:13:17,750
Don't think. Help her.

1228
02:13:18,300 --> 02:13:20,570
That's okay. But what you'll
make me say will be lies.

1229
02:13:21,260 --> 02:13:24,120
That you are Rambhajani and
I am Sadhuram is also a lie.

1230
02:13:24,690 --> 02:13:26,560
Everything is dust.
Everything will go to dust.

1231
02:13:27,340 --> 02:13:29,920
But a lie that
does good for someone...

1232
02:13:30,040 --> 02:13:34,230
- what can a greater truth than that?
- You're after me!

1233
02:13:34,510 --> 02:13:36,790
Send me back to Punjab.
I won't stay here.

1234
02:13:37,190 --> 02:13:40,440
Aunt, don't let Sadhuram influence you.

1235
02:13:43,310 --> 02:13:46,900
Wherever I go, I only spread sorrow.

1236
02:13:47,530 --> 02:13:51,880
It's not that, dear,
but he's got used to lying.

1237
02:13:52,160 --> 02:13:54,630
And then,
even you are like my daughter.

1238
02:13:55,160 --> 02:13:58,390
Then assume you're lying for your daughter.

1239
02:13:58,710 --> 02:14:02,550
- Live in hell for a day.
- Look, I'll do what you say.

1240
02:14:02,870 --> 02:14:06,220
But promise me you'll take me
to Haridwar to wash this sin.

1241
02:14:06,260 --> 02:14:09,880
Why just Haridwar?
I'll take you on a whole pilgrimage.

1242
02:14:10,020 --> 02:14:11,420
- My dear sister.
- God!

1243
02:14:12,050 --> 02:14:15,040
You touched my prayer dress.
I'll have to bathe again.

1244
02:14:15,070 --> 02:14:20,010
- Sir, Mr. Daulatram has come.
- You guys go inside.

1245
02:14:23,950 --> 02:14:27,160
- Come Mr. Daulatram. Hello.
- Hello.

1246
02:14:27,260 --> 02:14:30,316
- We were waiting for you.
- Are we very late?

1247
02:14:30,340 --> 02:14:32,370
Of course not. Please come.

1248
02:14:36,940 --> 02:14:38,040
Come.

1249
02:14:40,930 --> 02:14:43,670
- Hello.
- Hello.

1250
02:14:44,170 --> 02:14:48,120
She's my sister, Rambhajani,
Mohini's mother.

1251
02:14:48,600 --> 02:14:52,690
They are Anand's parents. Please sit down.

1252
02:14:54,460 --> 02:14:56,706
- Chhajju!
- Coming madam.

1253
02:14:56,730 --> 02:14:58,030
Bring it here.

1254
02:14:58,490 --> 02:14:59,930
Take. Drink.

1255
02:15:01,280 --> 02:15:05,160
- Why did you bother?
- Drink, you're the boy's family.

1256
02:15:05,280 --> 02:15:08,090
- The clan won't accuse you.
- Oh! I understand.

1257
02:15:09,390 --> 02:15:11,350
Sister, go bring Mohini.

1258
02:15:12,660 --> 02:15:17,320
Daulatram, do have this sweet.
It's made in oil made in my shop.

1259
02:15:17,630 --> 02:15:20,390
Since I've come to Delhi,
I've been eating oil from your shop.

1260
02:15:20,810 --> 02:15:23,110
Half of Delhi does that.

1261
02:15:25,570 --> 02:15:28,100
- What do you think?
- Great!

1262
02:15:28,520 --> 02:15:32,220
Touch their feet and say,
'pairi paini aanji'

1263
02:15:32,560 --> 02:15:35,160
Mom will be bowled over
just hearing that. Let me hear you say it.

1264
02:15:37,660 --> 02:15:39,390
- Don't greet me.
- Come Mohini.

1265
02:15:45,150 --> 02:15:46,880
- Pairi paini aanji?
- Yes.

1266
02:15:56,070 --> 02:15:58,280
Come dear, don't feel shy.

1267
02:15:59,370 --> 02:16:00,920
She's my niece, Mohini.

1268
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:05,900
- Pairi paini aanji.
- Bless you.

1269
02:16:07,640 --> 02:16:11,160
- Pairi paini aanji.
- Bless you.

1270
02:16:12,820 --> 02:16:18,300
Why are you shy?
She's so beautiful.

1271
02:16:18,470 --> 02:16:21,310
Make her stand in a dark home,
and she'll brighten it with her radiance.

1272
02:16:21,340 --> 02:16:24,840
Only Punjab can sire such
decent and shy girls.

1273
02:16:25,760 --> 02:16:29,210
Punjab is great! It's the king.

1274
02:16:30,750 --> 02:16:33,750
Mohini's mother, I accept her
as my daughter-in-law.

1275
02:16:34,290 --> 02:16:37,780
Why look any longer, Rambhajani?
Your wish has been fulfilled.

1276
02:16:45,930 --> 02:16:48,800
- Take, sister. Congratulations.
- Congratulations to you too.

1277
02:16:49,150 --> 02:16:51,360
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

1278
02:16:51,580 --> 02:16:54,820
Rambhajani, your
daughter will be very happy.

1279
02:16:55,440 --> 02:16:58,700
That's okay, but will you
take me to Haridwar?

1280
02:16:59,150 --> 02:17:02,780
Let the marriage take place first.
Then I'll push you there forever.

1281
02:17:03,850 --> 02:17:09,070
She has vowed to go to Haridwar
after her daughter's marriage.

1282
02:17:09,450 --> 02:17:11,950
Take me also to Haridwar with you.

1283
02:17:12,100 --> 02:17:15,676
- Sadhuram, we'll be going now.
- What's the hurry? Stay.

1284
02:17:15,700 --> 02:17:20,800
- No, I have lots of work to do.
- You go, I'll stay with Mohini.

1285
02:17:21,379 --> 02:17:24,509
- I feel like just looking at her.
- Okay, come along later.

1286
02:17:25,389 --> 02:17:27,259
- Pairi paini aanji.
- Bless you.

1287
02:17:27,309 --> 02:17:30,089
- Please sit, sister.
- Don't bother, I'll go.

1288
02:17:33,930 --> 02:17:35,330
- You?
- How are you?

1289
02:17:36,230 --> 02:17:38,810
- When did you return from Calcutta?
- This morning.

1290
02:17:40,570 --> 02:17:43,430
- Where is everyone?
- They've gone out.

1291
02:17:44,590 --> 02:17:47,190
- How's your father now?
- He's fine now.

1292
02:17:47,760 --> 02:17:50,840
But he was very bad. That's why
I had to stay back for so many days.

1293
02:17:51,790 --> 02:17:54,070
Or I had to make arrangements
for my exhibition here.

1294
02:17:54,870 --> 02:17:58,170
- When is the exhibition?
- The 24th of this month.

1295
02:17:58,959 --> 02:18:01,969
There is very little time.
Even you'll have to help me.

1296
02:18:03,740 --> 02:18:09,460
- I'll pray for your success.
- Not my success, our success.

1297
02:18:10,719 --> 02:18:15,139
God willing, we'll both exhibit
our works together next year.

1298
02:18:17,670 --> 02:18:24,360
What God wills for us,
perhaps even He doesn't know.

1299
02:18:25,309 --> 02:18:28,489
What do you mean?
I don't understand.

1300
02:18:32,480 --> 02:18:36,560
You look sad today.
Anything wrong?

1301
02:18:40,930 --> 02:18:47,610
Happiness is like a guest
in one's life.

1302
02:18:50,059 --> 02:18:52,109
Or there is only sorrow in life.

1303
02:18:56,020 --> 02:18:58,330
Father is looking for
another proposal for me.

1304
02:18:59,170 --> 02:19:02,060
But why?

1305
02:19:05,969 --> 02:19:09,989
He wants to marry me
into a Punjabi family.

1306
02:19:10,850 --> 02:19:14,750
Oh, so my being a
Bengali is against me.

1307
02:19:17,100 --> 02:19:19,440
Apart from Punjabis,
he considers everyone else bad.

1308
02:19:22,020 --> 02:19:26,670
- He doesn't consider anyone else good.
- Did you tell him about me?

1309
02:19:27,780 --> 02:19:29,480
Then how can you be so sure?

1310
02:19:30,980 --> 02:19:36,260
Even death can be averted, Ashok...

1311
02:19:38,700 --> 02:19:40,820
but it's impossible to make
father change his opinion.

1312
02:19:43,850 --> 02:19:45,870
His thoughts in
this regard are unchangeable.

1313
02:19:46,260 --> 02:19:49,380
I don't think he'll
sacrifice your happiness like that.

1314
02:19:50,750 --> 02:19:53,460
If you hesitate to talk to him,
I'll talk to him.

1315
02:19:58,910 --> 02:20:02,440
If our love is true,
he will never refuse.

1316
02:20:07,440 --> 02:20:09,750
I thought you were a decent man.

1317
02:20:11,430 --> 02:20:15,560
- Anyway, just leave!
- You misunderstand me.

1318
02:20:15,630 --> 02:20:16,830
Shut-up!

1319
02:20:17,250 --> 02:20:18,850
Aren't you ashamed to influence her?

1320
02:20:18,990 --> 02:20:20,970
- At least listen to me...
- Are you going or...

1321
02:20:21,000 --> 02:20:22,970
- Father!
- Get out of my sight!

1322
02:20:23,020 --> 02:20:28,280
Get out! If you come here again,
you'll be a dead man.

1323
02:20:31,970 --> 02:20:34,410
The rascal!

1324
02:20:42,850 --> 02:20:48,310
Hasn't your brother done enough,
that you also had to do this?

1325
02:20:48,360 --> 02:20:50,790
- You shameless girl!
- What are you doing! What happened?

1326
02:20:50,840 --> 02:20:54,480
Your head! Do you even
know what's going on in this house?

1327
02:20:54,930 --> 02:20:58,080
- Do you sit blindfolded at home?
- But what has happened?

1328
02:20:58,230 --> 02:21:01,130
Ask this shameless girl.
I'm even ashamed to say it.

1329
02:21:04,200 --> 02:21:06,610
What happened, Nikki?
Tell me!

1330
02:21:12,230 --> 02:21:15,250
What happened?
Tell me about it.

1331
02:21:16,420 --> 02:21:21,490
I wanted the boy to go abroad and
finish his education before marriage.

1332
02:21:22,300 --> 02:21:25,860
But you have as much right
over the boy as me.

1333
02:21:26,630 --> 02:21:29,420
If you like,
I'll send him abroad after marriage.

1334
02:21:30,180 --> 02:21:31,480
That's even better.

1335
02:21:32,470 --> 02:21:36,690
You are aware that one who has
a young daughter spends sleepless nights.

1336
02:21:37,450 --> 02:21:39,960
Women become even more stressed.

1337
02:21:40,380 --> 02:21:43,420
Yes, matters related to
a daughter are delicate.

1338
02:21:43,690 --> 02:21:47,050
Where am I denying it?
I have no problem.

1339
02:21:47,570 --> 02:21:49,570
I'll bring my son as a groom
whenever you like.

1340
02:21:50,270 --> 02:21:52,590
You'll have to make all the arrangements.

1341
02:21:52,780 --> 02:21:57,090
- You have any special demands?
- Nonsense.

1342
02:21:57,480 --> 02:22:00,250
You can give away your girl
in just her bridal dress.

1343
02:22:01,870 --> 02:22:04,500
Father went to fix Nikki's
marriage in his passion.

1344
02:22:05,100 --> 02:22:09,090
- But did he consider the consequences?
- Shut-up! She's been influenced by you.

1345
02:22:09,270 --> 02:22:12,210
- Or she wouldn't dare do such a thing.
- Alright, I'm bad.

1346
02:22:12,690 --> 02:22:15,290
But you should have at least
asked your daughter what she wants.

1347
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:19,400
Why should I ask her? I'm her mother.
I know what's good or bad for her.

1348
02:22:19,590 --> 02:22:23,260
If you knew, she wouldn't
be suffering like that.

1349
02:22:23,670 --> 02:22:26,440
Nikki, why don't you speak?
They won't hang you.

1350
02:22:28,510 --> 02:22:30,610
It's better they hang me
than get me married.

1351
02:22:30,680 --> 02:22:33,780
What did you say! If your father
hears you, he'll kill you.

1352
02:22:35,310 --> 02:22:39,080
Kill me if you like,
but I won't get married.

1353
02:22:39,480 --> 02:22:42,480
- What did you say? Say it again.
- I won't get married!

1354
02:22:42,790 --> 02:22:44,970
- You won't?
- I won't!

1355
02:22:47,460 --> 02:22:52,360
- Mom!
- I'll kill her! Move away!

1356
02:22:57,290 --> 02:23:00,500
Mom, what are you doing!
Have you gone mad?

1357
02:23:00,730 --> 02:23:02,330
Why are you creating a scene?

1358
02:23:22,510 --> 02:23:26,490
She'll recover in 1-2 hours.
Keep her away from stress.

1359
02:23:27,050 --> 02:23:29,110
She shouldn't suffer any kind of shock.

1360
02:23:29,400 --> 02:23:32,230
I hope there's no
danger to her life, doctor.

1361
02:23:32,950 --> 02:23:35,520
Nothing can be said for sure
about a heart patient.

1362
02:23:36,230 --> 02:23:40,220
Better be careful.
The next attack could be fatal.

1363
02:24:06,300 --> 02:24:13,400
People, ask for children so they
can be comfortable in old age.

1364
02:24:15,640 --> 02:24:22,300
We've sired children
so they can kill us.

1365
02:24:46,700 --> 02:24:54,700
Mom, forgive me.
Just get well once.

1366
02:24:57,850 --> 02:25:02,690
Just get well once,
and I'll do whatever you say.

1367
02:25:04,620 --> 02:25:12,620
I'll do whatever you say.
Just get well now.

1368
02:25:26,450 --> 02:25:31,100
But, after knowing everything
you shouldn't have come here.

1369
02:25:33,740 --> 02:25:36,190
It'll be so bad if
anyone sees you here.

1370
02:25:38,280 --> 02:25:40,440
What can be worse than
what is happening now?

1371
02:25:43,530 --> 02:25:48,180
Ashok, if this is life...

1372
02:25:51,560 --> 02:25:52,960
death would be better.

1373
02:25:53,590 --> 02:25:58,210
Have patience, Nikki.
What you're doing is right.

1374
02:26:00,580 --> 02:26:03,250
Pleasing your parents is
also one of your duties.

1375
02:26:07,200 --> 02:26:09,460
Your staying here for long isn't proper.

1376
02:26:31,220 --> 02:26:32,820
What is this you're doing, Nikki?

1377
02:26:34,970 --> 02:26:38,690
Won't you even bless me
before I leave?

1378
02:26:39,870 --> 02:26:44,020
Bless? My every sinew
is blessing you.

1379
02:26:56,950 --> 02:27:00,030
May you never be widowed.

1380
02:27:01,650 --> 02:27:06,070
May God always shower
you with comfort and happiness.

1381
02:27:08,190 --> 02:27:13,590
May I suffer all your
sorrows and tears.

1382
02:27:43,660 --> 02:27:50,220
Maiden, your dream man
has come to take you

1383
02:27:50,530 --> 02:27:54,670
Get dressed as a bride

1384
02:27:55,480 --> 02:28:01,160
And be ready to leave with him

1385
02:28:01,390 --> 02:28:06,290
Men are standing by with your palanquin

1386
02:28:45,730 --> 02:28:52,130
From tomorrow,
you will belong to your beau

1387
02:28:54,660 --> 02:29:00,920
You will please his heart

1388
02:29:07,620 --> 02:29:12,450
Forget your entire past, friend

1389
02:29:18,720 --> 02:29:23,640
Forget your childhood love

1390
02:29:24,390 --> 02:29:29,540
Men are standing by with your palanquin

1391
02:30:11,920 --> 02:30:18,650
Why are your eyes brimming
with tears now, maiden?

1392
02:30:20,970 --> 02:30:27,000
Everyone has to part one day

1393
02:30:33,690 --> 02:30:38,590
Staying with one's parents is temporary

1394
02:30:44,820 --> 02:30:50,530
Everyone has to leave for her
husband's home

1395
02:30:50,590 --> 02:30:55,660
Men are standing by with your palanquin

1396
02:31:08,980 --> 02:31:11,970
- Congratulations.
- To you too.

1397
02:31:33,390 --> 02:31:38,970
Sardarilal, find out what
he's giving as a dowry.

1398
02:31:39,260 --> 02:31:44,540
- Yes sure, why hesitate? Come.
- Come.

1399
02:32:04,170 --> 02:32:09,310
- How much money is in that plate?
- Rs.1001.

1400
02:32:09,860 --> 02:32:11,160
Only Rs.1001?

1401
02:32:11,730 --> 02:32:15,730
Sardarilal, Daulatram isn't
giving his daughter anything.

1402
02:32:16,050 --> 02:32:19,786
What can be said now?
Didn't you already discuss this?

1403
02:32:19,810 --> 02:32:21,650
One doesn't need to
talk about such things.

1404
02:32:22,220 --> 02:32:25,470
Anyway, where is Daulatram?
Come with me.

1405
02:32:25,980 --> 02:32:29,720
- Bring the bride and groom.
- Yes, priest.

1406
02:32:31,260 --> 02:32:33,290
Anand, go inform inside.

1407
02:32:34,510 --> 02:32:35,870
Come son.

1408
02:32:39,050 --> 02:32:45,400
Remain seated. Daulatram, please come here.

1409
02:32:46,240 --> 02:32:47,330
Sure.

1410
02:32:52,050 --> 02:32:54,730
- What's the matter?
- Come inside.

1411
02:32:58,420 --> 02:33:03,980
- What's all this?
- I don't understand.

1412
02:33:04,140 --> 02:33:08,240
What's there to understand? Is this
all you're giving your daughter?

1413
02:33:08,910 --> 02:33:11,630
You should have at least
considered our prestige.

1414
02:33:15,690 --> 02:33:19,080
Chunnilal, I have given
more than I could afford.

1415
02:33:19,810 --> 02:33:24,640
If this is all you could afford, you
should have chosen a boy of your level.

1416
02:33:25,120 --> 02:33:27,200
How will I show so little
to my people?

1417
02:33:28,330 --> 02:33:32,120
If that was the case,
why didn't you make it clear that day?

1418
02:33:32,470 --> 02:33:36,310
- I even asked you.
- I told you my son was going abroad.

1419
02:33:36,690 --> 02:33:40,800
What else could I have said?
Marriage is not a business deal.

1420
02:33:41,900 --> 02:33:43,610
You've only donated Rs.1000.

1421
02:33:44,060 --> 02:33:48,040
If not 25, not 20, you should
have at least given 15 thousand.

1422
02:33:48,700 --> 02:33:51,820
- Rs.15000!
- I can't take less than that.

1423
02:33:52,410 --> 02:33:55,320
Besides, whatever you're giving,
you're giving your daughter.

1424
02:33:56,540 --> 02:34:01,870
You're right, but how can
I arrange such a huge sum so quickly?

1425
02:34:02,100 --> 02:34:05,960
You can arrange it if you like,
or I haven't lost anything yet.

1426
02:34:06,540 --> 02:34:08,340
The girl is still
in her father's house.

1427
02:34:10,770 --> 02:34:14,420
What are you saying?
It's a life and death matter for me.

1428
02:34:20,710 --> 02:34:22,410
Is he a man or a fiend?

1429
02:34:22,550 --> 02:34:25,260
I don't understand why
father is begging before him.

1430
02:34:25,540 --> 02:34:28,820
What will happen now?
Rs.15000 is no small amount.

1431
02:34:29,370 --> 02:34:31,070
How will we arrange so much money?

1432
02:34:31,170 --> 02:34:35,030
Mom, I don't think we should
have anything to do with such a man.

1433
02:34:35,360 --> 02:34:36,986
If he can do this now,
what will he do after marriage?

1434
02:34:37,010 --> 02:34:40,440
You keep quiet! What do you know?
Go look after the guests.

1435
02:34:40,800 --> 02:34:43,970
If the groom returns,
we'll be doomed.

1436
02:34:44,970 --> 02:34:46,810
If the groom returns,
I will be doomed.

1437
02:34:47,320 --> 02:34:52,320
You're my brothers, my clan. If you
help me, my honor can be saved.

1438
02:34:52,820 --> 02:34:54,320
My honor is your honor.

1439
02:34:58,730 --> 02:35:03,180
Kanhaiyalal, you're a wealthy man.
You can save me.

1440
02:35:03,970 --> 02:35:10,360
Everyone looks rich;
but you don't know my real state.

1441
02:35:10,670 --> 02:35:13,670
Had you mentioned this a few days ago,
perhaps we could have done something.

1442
02:35:14,010 --> 02:35:15,810
What can we do on such short notice?

1443
02:35:16,010 --> 02:35:17,210
Mr. Kapoor?

1444
02:35:22,200 --> 02:35:25,600
Daulatram, why are you
insulting us like that?

1445
02:35:26,830 --> 02:35:30,580
If we could do something,
your daughter is like our daughter.

1446
02:35:34,610 --> 02:35:40,740
Look Daulatram, they're being formal.
But I'll be point blank.

1447
02:35:41,600 --> 02:35:46,250
All of them are so rich
that they can give you Rs.15000.

1448
02:35:46,950 --> 02:35:49,770
But if they do, then on what basis?

1449
02:35:50,320 --> 02:35:52,950
Do you own any land or property?

1450
02:35:53,820 --> 02:35:57,780
Sardarilal, I'll work all my life
and repay this loan.

1451
02:35:58,290 --> 02:36:00,660
You make only Rs.600 a month.

1452
02:36:01,250 --> 02:36:06,740
You won't be able to repay a loan of
Rs.15000 in 15 lives.

1453
02:36:07,980 --> 02:36:10,710
It's better you go
and convince Chunnilal.

1454
02:36:11,530 --> 02:36:13,160
Even he is human after all.

1455
02:36:32,260 --> 02:36:34,630
What do you have to say, Daulatram?

1456
02:36:41,680 --> 02:36:45,840
Chunnilal, please ensure my honor.

1457
02:36:47,560 --> 02:36:49,550
I'll never forget this favor.

1458
02:36:50,540 --> 02:36:52,030
I'll repay every penny.

1459
02:36:53,440 --> 02:36:57,700
I only requested Rs.15000.

1460
02:36:58,430 --> 02:37:01,150
When you can't arrange it now,
how will you arrange it later?

1461
02:37:01,760 --> 02:37:04,030
Come on, let's go back.

1462
02:37:04,300 --> 02:37:11,320
Chunnilal, please don't do this!
My honor is in your hands.

1463
02:37:12,140 --> 02:37:14,090
Have mercy on me.

1464
02:37:15,560 --> 02:37:19,310
Don't bring tears to my daughter.

1465
02:37:20,010 --> 02:37:24,470
Take my daughter away.
I'll always be grateful to you.

1466
02:37:25,830 --> 02:37:28,440
What are you doing, Daulatram!

1467
02:37:28,890 --> 02:37:31,910
Stop this act.
Everyone hold his honor dear.

1468
02:37:32,460 --> 02:37:35,820
- Come son. Let's go, brothers.
- Wait!

1469
02:37:43,840 --> 02:37:45,140
You've come here?

1470
02:37:49,890 --> 02:37:54,790
You rascal!
Shameless! Why have you come?

1471
02:38:12,940 --> 02:38:15,110
I hope this is good enough for you.

1472
02:38:18,080 --> 02:38:20,000
Pardon me, but who are you?

1473
02:38:21,290 --> 02:38:24,590
You can assume the honor
of this home is my honor too.

1474
02:38:25,220 --> 02:38:26,940
Accept them without hesitation.

1475
02:38:29,210 --> 02:38:30,710
What do you say, Daulatram?

1476
02:38:33,460 --> 02:38:37,250
Why not?
A friend in need is a friend indeed.

1477
02:38:37,650 --> 02:38:41,020
We came here for a marriage,
not to create a scene.

1478
02:38:42,150 --> 02:38:45,600
Give and take goes on even
between father and son.

1479
02:38:46,610 --> 02:38:49,230
Come son, sit for the rituals.

1480
02:40:07,310 --> 02:40:11,080
Why not?
A friend in need is a friend indeed.

1481
02:40:14,160 --> 02:40:15,960
A friend in need is a friend indeed.

1482
02:40:24,990 --> 02:40:26,190
Stop it!

1483
02:40:31,340 --> 02:40:35,150
- Stop this nonsense!
- What do you mean?

1484
02:40:40,440 --> 02:40:41,530
Mean?

1485
02:40:46,060 --> 02:40:47,560
Are you in your senses?

1486
02:40:48,680 --> 02:40:51,710
I wasn't before. I am now.

1487
02:40:52,910 --> 02:40:56,160
- I've recognised everyone now!
- Mind your tongue!

1488
02:40:56,550 --> 02:41:00,320
You're not only insulting me,
but the whole clan.

1489
02:41:00,880 --> 02:41:05,690
Clan? What clan?
Do you understand the meaning of clan?

1490
02:41:06,830 --> 02:41:13,280
Clan means brotherhood. Supporting
each other, helping each other in need.

1491
02:41:14,130 --> 02:41:17,170
Not playing with the
honor of a helpless man.

1492
02:41:18,110 --> 02:41:19,630
Not watching his helplessness quietly.

1493
02:41:20,230 --> 02:41:23,140
I don't give a damn for such a clan!
Damn such a clan!

1494
02:41:23,200 --> 02:41:25,420
Daulatram! Enough!

1495
02:41:25,810 --> 02:41:28,170
Making enemies with your clan
will make your life difficult.

1496
02:41:28,460 --> 02:41:32,940
I don't fear a handful
of my clan any longer.

1497
02:41:33,460 --> 02:41:39,060
My clan is very big today. My clan
includes this man Ashok, a Bengali.

1498
02:41:39,780 --> 02:41:42,000
He considered my honor as his honor.

1499
02:41:42,760 --> 02:41:46,170
My clan includes this Madrasi, Subramanium.

1500
02:41:46,730 --> 02:41:48,920
Despite losing his daughter,
he stands beside me.

1501
02:41:49,830 --> 02:41:51,960
Today, my clan is the whole of India.

1502
02:41:52,710 --> 02:41:58,110
Come brothers, we cannot
stay here a minute longer. Let's go.

1503
02:42:01,150 --> 02:42:03,210
Lalaji, give back the jewelry box.

1504
02:42:04,410 --> 02:42:06,910
Let's see how your
daughter gets married now.

1505
02:42:11,930 --> 02:42:13,850
My daughter will get
married here, and right now!

1506
02:42:14,750 --> 02:42:18,770
Ashok, I have
realized my mistake today.

1507
02:42:19,980 --> 02:42:24,080
Give me a chance to atone.
Come, marry my daughter.

1508
02:42:25,240 --> 02:42:28,240
I was ruining my daughter's
happiness for these businessmen.

1509
02:42:28,790 --> 02:42:29,990
Come son.

1510
02:42:31,090 --> 02:42:37,620
Subramanium, you are my brother.
Nikki is your daughter.

1511
02:42:38,440 --> 02:42:41,490
You give her away. Come.

1512
02:42:43,550 --> 02:42:48,650
Daulatram, I am very happy
to see your views have changed.

1513
02:42:49,710 --> 02:42:52,840
To double this happiness...

1514
02:42:53,240 --> 02:42:58,450
I wish my niece and your son
to get married now, too.

1515
02:42:59,060 --> 02:43:05,060
Sadhuram, before I say anything
offensive, please leave.

1516
02:43:05,820 --> 02:43:10,120
I don't want anything
to do with Punjabis now!

1517
02:43:11,870 --> 02:43:15,920
This isn't you talking,
but my oil.

1518
02:43:16,310 --> 02:43:17,910
What are you trying to say?

1519
02:43:17,950 --> 02:43:22,050
That you realized one mistake
and are making another.

1520
02:43:22,650 --> 02:43:26,480
Earlier, apart from Punjabis,
you considered everyone else bad.

1521
02:43:26,880 --> 02:43:31,200
Today, because of one Punjabi,
you consider all of them bad.

1522
02:43:31,260 --> 02:43:33,940
If you were in my place,
what would you do?

1523
02:43:34,080 --> 02:43:40,120
You have never tested humanity
until today.

1524
02:43:40,730 --> 02:43:43,560
Sticking a label of a state
doesn't make anyone good or bad.

1525
02:43:44,190 --> 02:43:47,590
A man's behavior, his deeds
make him good or bad.

1526
02:43:48,830 --> 02:43:54,980
You rejected this girl one day
because she was a Madrasi.

1527
02:43:55,440 --> 02:44:01,030
Today, you are rejecting her
because she is a Punjabi.

1528
02:44:10,710 --> 02:44:15,540
- Sadhuram?
- Yes Subramanium, she's Janaki.

1529
02:44:22,670 --> 02:44:23,770
Father!

1530
02:44:25,900 --> 02:44:29,280
Did you have to punish
your old father like that?

1531
02:44:30,590 --> 02:44:31,690
Father!

1532
02:44:36,650 --> 02:44:39,780
You did the right thing.

1533
02:44:43,580 --> 02:44:48,800
The credit for saving Janaki's
life goes to Sadhuram.

1534
02:44:49,980 --> 02:44:54,890
The auspicious time is running out.
Give away the brides.

1535
02:44:55,090 --> 02:44:57,420
Come, Mr. Kumarswami.

1536
02:44:58,500 --> 02:45:03,160
- Come, sit down.
- Subramanium, have the girl sit there.

1537
02:45:07,650 --> 02:45:11,570
Come Ashok, sit. Congratulations.

1538
02:45:14,570 --> 02:45:20,370
Priest, begin.
I mean, you'll be paid double.

1539
02:45:27,380 --> 02:45:31,970
India is the best in the world

1540
02:45:40,880 --> 02:45:45,810
Religion doesn't teach us
to be enemies of each other
