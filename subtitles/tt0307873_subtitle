1
00:00:00,042 --> 00:00:03,542
23.976

2
00:00:31,981 --> 00:00:37,116
My story travels far and wide across
these beautiful valleys of Ooty

3
00:00:37,909 --> 00:00:41,498
Like roses, and thorns

4
00:00:41,499 --> 00:00:46,802
Here it was that I became
someone's wife... and a woman

5
00:00:47,888 --> 00:00:52,354
Love, devotion, faith
and sacrifice...

6
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:56,529
it was here that I got to know
what they really meant

7
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:59,870
Here it was that I practically
touched my life

8
00:01:00,872 --> 00:01:06,675
At this place, I felt the cold
feeling of death, touch my body

9
00:01:07,719 --> 00:01:12,227
There was a group of college students
on a picnic, that particular night

10
00:01:13,731 --> 00:01:18,156
Little did I know that
what was happening then...

11
00:01:18,783 --> 00:01:22,707
would also affect my life

12
00:01:29,011 --> 00:01:32,101
You must do it.
The bottle stopped on you

13
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:37,730
That's the rule, isn't it guys?

14
00:01:41,954 --> 00:01:46,331
Stop it!

15
00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:04,790
Nisha, stop there!

16
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,794
Where are you going?

17
00:02:06,795 --> 00:02:12,299
You might have to kiss
a lion or a tiger ahead!

18
00:02:18,234 --> 00:02:20,947
Why're you bothering me?

19
00:02:20,948 --> 00:02:26,327
I'm going to find you anyway!

20
00:02:26,877 --> 00:02:29,507
Stop bothering me!

21
00:02:29,508 --> 00:02:34,677
Where are you hiding?

22
00:02:35,227 --> 00:02:37,523
She hasn't gone into that
bungalow, has she?

23
00:02:37,524 --> 00:02:40,780
Nisha! That bungalow
doesn't belong to us!

24
00:02:42,992 --> 00:02:44,745
Come on out

25
00:02:44,746 --> 00:02:48,294
If you get caught, there's no saying
how many guys you'll have to kiss!

26
00:02:52,302 --> 00:02:54,974
Listen to me!

27
00:02:54,975 --> 00:03:00,395
Give me a kiss, please!

28
00:03:44,699 --> 00:03:49,160
Rohit!

29
00:03:49,751 --> 00:03:54,337
Who's there?

30
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:14,210
Who is it?

31
00:04:56,927 --> 00:04:59,013
Raghu

32
00:04:59,014 --> 00:05:00,015
Yes, sir?

33
00:05:00,016 --> 00:05:02,855
Is someone here to meet me?

34
00:05:02,856 --> 00:05:07,608
There's nobody, sir

35
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:29,324
Inspector?

36
00:05:29,325 --> 00:05:33,917
Has there been a mishap
in the hills?

37
00:05:33,918 --> 00:05:36,923
It's a strange incident

38
00:05:36,924 --> 00:05:40,932
The police can't understand.
Only you can help us

39
00:05:57,799 --> 00:06:00,845
He's the girl's boyfriend, sir

40
00:06:00,846 --> 00:06:04,812
He has a broken bone
in his shoulder

41
00:06:04,813 --> 00:06:07,859
He can't believe...

42
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:10,155
how his girlfriend...

43
00:06:10,156 --> 00:06:13,621
attacked him like a wild beast

44
00:06:13,622 --> 00:06:16,001
Where's the girl?

45
00:06:16,002 --> 00:06:19,675
The doctors aren't letting
anyone close to her

46
00:06:19,676 --> 00:06:25,722
If you wish, you can take
a look at her from there

47
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:50,069
I've awakened! I'm awake!

48
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:53,075
I'm not going to spare him!

49
00:06:53,076 --> 00:06:56,414
He'll have to come!

50
00:06:56,415 --> 00:07:00,130
I'm awake! And he'll have to come!

51
00:07:00,131 --> 00:07:03,262
They'll all awaken.
Like hell they will

52
00:07:03,263 --> 00:07:08,480
I'm not going to spare him!
No way!

53
00:07:08,481 --> 00:07:11,571
I've awakened...
I'm awake!

54
00:07:12,489 --> 00:07:15,537
What are you staring at,
you swine?

55
00:07:15,538 --> 00:07:18,751
You think you will stop me?
Me?

56
00:07:18,752 --> 00:07:20,755
No!

57
00:07:20,756 --> 00:07:22,133
I've awakened!

58
00:07:22,134 --> 00:07:26,594
I'm awake!

59
00:07:27,979 --> 00:07:31,652
I've already given her two injections.
They have no effect on her, sir

60
00:07:31,653 --> 00:07:35,910
It won't have any effect!

61
00:07:35,911 --> 00:07:39,000
What you think is a disease
of the brain...

62
00:07:39,001 --> 00:07:42,256
is in fact a disease
chasing man for centuries

63
00:07:42,257 --> 00:07:44,302
No matter what you do...

64
00:07:44,303 --> 00:07:47,851
you can't cure this disease

65
00:07:47,852 --> 00:07:50,189
Because you can treat
only human beings

66
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:51,984
Not erratic souls

67
00:07:51,985 --> 00:07:56,076
And this is an erratic soul

68
00:07:56,077 --> 00:07:59,248
But you are not going
to believe me

69
00:07:59,249 --> 00:08:05,422
Because it does not suit
your profession to believe me

70
00:08:07,809 --> 00:08:10,939
You weren't the one who was attacked.
It was the girl herself

71
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:12,984
We have very little time

72
00:08:12,985 --> 00:08:16,952
Her body won't be able to tolerate
the spirit for very long. It'll explode

73
00:08:17,494 --> 00:08:21,001
Do you want to save her?

74
00:08:21,002 --> 00:08:24,717
Where did it happen?

75
00:08:24,718 --> 00:08:27,973
Where?

76
00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:29,810
I was standing there

77
00:08:29,811 --> 00:08:32,983
When I heard her cries...

78
00:08:32,984 --> 00:08:35,780
I ran and came here

79
00:08:35,781 --> 00:08:40,122
She was standing right there

80
00:08:40,123 --> 00:08:42,043
Calm and quiet

81
00:08:42,044 --> 00:08:45,842
What did you feel when
you got close to her?

82
00:08:45,843 --> 00:08:48,932
I thought she was upto mischief
to bring me closer

83
00:08:50,101 --> 00:08:52,856
What else?

84
00:08:52,857 --> 00:08:55,277
Was there any other sign...?

85
00:08:55,278 --> 00:08:59,160
A gust of wind that could perhaps
have meant to tell you something?

86
00:08:59,161 --> 00:09:00,914
No.

87
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:04,671
Didn't you feel as if you were
being drawn away by the hand...

88
00:09:04,672 --> 00:09:06,842
and you had no control
over yourself?

89
00:09:06,843 --> 00:09:08,011
No.

90
00:09:08,012 --> 00:09:11,476
Did you see someone else's face
in hers, when you got closer?

91
00:09:11,477 --> 00:09:13,689
No.

92
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:17,697
Did you see terror in her eyes?

93
00:09:17,698 --> 00:09:22,075
No.

94
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:26,633
It all happened so quickly
that I felt...

95
00:09:27,175 --> 00:09:30,723
Oh yes! The force with which
she pushed me, it felt as if...

96
00:09:30,724 --> 00:09:33,856
It sure tells us that it wasn't
the doing of a human being

97
00:09:34,858 --> 00:09:40,236
It was an evil spirit at work

98
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:47,256
Spirits draw strength from places
like this...

99
00:09:47,257 --> 00:09:51,223
where an accident
might have taken place

100
00:09:54,104 --> 00:09:57,611
At places where...

101
00:09:57,612 --> 00:10:01,243
where someone has sinned or where
something foul has taken place

102
00:10:04,876 --> 00:10:11,090
By coming here, you have
awakened a passive spirit

103
00:10:39,153 --> 00:10:44,615
Manoj here.
- Go on

104
00:10:47,294 --> 00:10:52,339
She has left us

105
00:11:01,573 --> 00:11:05,245
This is only the beginning

106
00:11:05,246 --> 00:11:08,669
What does that mean?

107
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:11,634
Lts goal hasn't yet
been accomplished

108
00:11:11,635 --> 00:11:15,058
If it's really a spirit...
can't we stop it?

109
00:11:17,772 --> 00:11:21,530
What transpired here?
Whose soul is it?

110
00:11:23,241 --> 00:11:27,123
What does it want...?
It's all a secret

111
00:11:29,253 --> 00:11:33,260
A secret...

112
00:11:33,261 --> 00:11:37,059
that lies buried somewhere here

113
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:41,234
Unless we unravel the mystery...

114
00:11:41,235 --> 00:11:46,655
it'll be difficult
to stop the spirit

115
00:11:47,038 --> 00:11:52,507
Looks like lightning
will strike again

116
00:11:52,508 --> 00:11:59,062
On whom? And where?
Nobody knows

117
00:12:46,031 --> 00:12:49,328
This is a city of peace

118
00:12:49,329 --> 00:12:52,878
The air here
is unique

119
00:12:53,462 --> 00:12:56,636
It's peaceful here

120
00:12:57,513 --> 00:13:00,811
Everything is at peace

121
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:05,403
Everything is at peace

122
00:13:49,701 --> 00:13:51,787
There's sunshine,
there's shade...

123
00:13:51,788 --> 00:13:54,125
there are moonlit nights

124
00:13:54,126 --> 00:13:57,925
Beautiful girls throng the place

125
00:14:02,267 --> 00:14:04,730
There are dreams,
there are celebrations...

126
00:14:04,731 --> 00:14:06,650
and parties for the young

127
00:14:06,651 --> 00:14:10,408
There's fun and frolic,
and merry-making everywhere

128
00:14:17,088 --> 00:14:20,136
This is a city of peace

129
00:14:21,055 --> 00:14:24,604
The ambience here is unique

130
00:14:33,245 --> 00:14:37,336
Everything is at peace

131
00:14:37,337 --> 00:14:40,677
There's peace and quiet

132
00:15:20,924 --> 00:15:23,094
There are secrets...

133
00:15:23,095 --> 00:15:25,307
and there's love in hearts

134
00:15:25,308 --> 00:15:27,311
There are friendships...

135
00:15:27,312 --> 00:15:32,899
even foes are buddies

136
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,828
There are desires,
there's comfort...

137
00:15:35,829 --> 00:15:38,041
here you can reach
for the Moon

138
00:15:38,042 --> 00:15:41,758
Summer and winter...
you have every season here

139
00:15:48,897 --> 00:15:52,194
This is a city of peace

140
00:15:52,195 --> 00:15:56,119
The atmosphere here is unique

141
00:15:57,205 --> 00:16:00,503
This is a city of peace

142
00:16:00,504 --> 00:16:03,802
The atmosphere here is unique

143
00:16:04,427 --> 00:16:07,518
Everything here is at peace

144
00:16:09,062 --> 00:16:15,485
Everything here is at peace

145
00:16:31,691 --> 00:16:34,069
What insolence is this?

146
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:35,781
You take me for a sidekick?

147
00:16:35,782 --> 00:16:38,662
It's you who's treating me
like a sidekick, Aditya

148
00:16:38,663 --> 00:16:41,585
It doesn't seem as
if you've married me

149
00:16:41,586 --> 00:16:43,589
It appears as if you've bought me!

150
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:46,596
For three hours, I've been
sitting all by myself...

151
00:16:47,055 --> 00:16:50,101
waiting for you to
cast a glance at me

152
00:16:50,102 --> 00:16:56,316
But you can't find the time
from your merry-making

153
00:16:58,745 --> 00:17:01,750
Don't you know this
is a business party?

154
00:17:01,751 --> 00:17:07,135
They've come in a delegation
from Hong Kong

155
00:17:07,136 --> 00:17:09,473
Let me go in

156
00:17:09,474 --> 00:17:12,898
Apart from listening to your crap,
I've also got to run my business

157
00:17:13,525 --> 00:17:18,409
All right. Run your business,
whether your family lives or not

158
00:17:26,551 --> 00:17:29,932
Everything here is at peace

159
00:17:30,976 --> 00:17:34,441
Everything is peaceful

160
00:18:32,265 --> 00:18:36,899
I can't understand where
the girl went from the party

161
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:43,161
Why did she have to leave all alone?

162
00:18:43,162 --> 00:18:49,251
Aditya... what is the matter?

163
00:18:55,812 --> 00:18:59,152
Despite such an accident, she hasn't
as much as suffered a scratch

164
00:18:59,695 --> 00:19:04,663
What's this, if not a miracle?

165
00:19:04,664 --> 00:19:08,545
Ask her to be careful
in future

166
00:19:08,546 --> 00:19:12,011
She shouldn't be driving after
having so many sleeping pills

167
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:16,394
It's like this, Mr Aditya...

168
00:19:16,395 --> 00:19:20,193
she badly needs your care
right now

169
00:19:20,194 --> 00:19:23,575
God has saved her

170
00:19:23,576 --> 00:19:28,954
Or you had surely lost her today

171
00:19:47,791 --> 00:19:52,132
Must you punish me like this?

172
00:19:52,133 --> 00:19:54,303
What if something
had happened to you?

173
00:19:54,304 --> 00:19:59,188
For how long will we keep
deceiving ourselves?

174
00:19:59,189 --> 00:20:02,780
I'm sick of fighting all the time

175
00:20:05,702 --> 00:20:11,456
It's time we separated, Aditya

176
00:20:12,131 --> 00:20:17,135
Don't say that, Sanjana

177
00:20:21,191 --> 00:20:24,572
It's of no use

178
00:20:24,573 --> 00:20:27,620
You're not the same Aditya anymore

179
00:20:27,621 --> 00:20:32,212
You're not the man
I fell in love with

180
00:20:32,213 --> 00:20:35,720
In just a year,
you've changed so much

181
00:20:37,975 --> 00:20:42,984
What's gotten into you?

182
00:20:42,985 --> 00:20:46,116
There's a chasm between us...
- I'll do away with the chasm

183
00:20:51,001 --> 00:20:54,131
I need just one opportunity

184
00:20:54,132 --> 00:20:57,930
Let's go someplace
far away from here

185
00:20:57,931 --> 00:21:04,187
Someplace where only
you and I are there

186
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:10,706
How about that delegation
from Hong Kong?

187
00:21:10,707 --> 00:21:14,757
They can wait. But I don't
want to lose you again

188
00:21:16,803 --> 00:21:22,223
Where would you like to go?

189
00:21:24,652 --> 00:21:26,988
I want to take you somewhere
far away...

190
00:21:26,989 --> 00:21:30,412
where no voice calls out to us...
except we, to each other

191
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:35,207
Ooty.

192
00:21:35,632 --> 00:21:39,765
I want it to start there
all over again

193
00:21:41,143 --> 00:21:43,897
That's where we first met

194
00:21:43,898 --> 00:21:49,486
That's where we fell in love

195
00:22:39,217 --> 00:22:44,554
I'll do the make up for you!

196
00:22:47,985 --> 00:22:50,280
Lay off!
- Where will you go?

197
00:22:50,281 --> 00:22:56,286
Lay off, I say!
- I'm going to colour you!

198
00:22:56,794 --> 00:23:01,755
No, Sanjana! No!

199
00:23:07,691 --> 00:23:10,821
Hurry up!

200
00:23:10,822 --> 00:23:16,034
How long will you make me wait?

201
00:23:53,115 --> 00:23:58,458
Even if you do come across me...

202
00:23:59,002 --> 00:24:04,555
please do pull
a veil across your face

203
00:24:07,602 --> 00:24:12,445
Our wedding isn't very far away...

204
00:24:12,863 --> 00:24:18,583
I must pine.
You must long for me too

205
00:24:27,141 --> 00:24:31,817
That's the problem
with my heart

206
00:24:32,694 --> 00:24:37,829
You tell me how am
I to remain quiet

207
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:43,925
Even if I do come across you...

208
00:24:44,635 --> 00:24:49,978
I ought to pull
a veil across my face

209
00:24:53,026 --> 00:24:58,538
Our wedding isn't very far away...

210
00:24:59,038 --> 00:25:04,550
I must pine.
You must pine too

211
00:25:12,649 --> 00:25:17,576
That's the problem
with my heart

212
00:25:18,118 --> 00:25:23,546
You tell me how I am
to remain quiet

213
00:26:00,995 --> 00:26:04,503
These are the times when
I must pester you and flatter you

214
00:26:04,878 --> 00:26:09,262
These are the times
I must try you out

215
00:26:09,721 --> 00:26:16,019
I hope you get the message, my love

216
00:26:18,071 --> 00:26:20,951
This is just what my problem is

217
00:26:20,952 --> 00:26:24,543
I can no longer bear
the distance between us

218
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:29,427
How will I tell you what
I'm going through, my love

219
00:26:29,887 --> 00:26:34,855
The earth and the skies
will bear witness...

220
00:26:35,481 --> 00:26:40,324
you and I will come together

221
00:26:41,493 --> 00:26:46,670
Even if I look into your eyes...

222
00:26:47,129 --> 00:26:53,518
I wish you would
veil your face

223
00:27:20,989 --> 00:27:26,457
If I were to leave this world,
and never return again...

224
00:27:26,876 --> 00:27:32,428
what would you do, my love?

225
00:27:38,064 --> 00:27:41,028
From God, I would snatch you

226
00:27:41,029 --> 00:27:44,034
I'll make you belong to me

227
00:27:44,035 --> 00:27:49,420
Till as long as we live,
we shall never part

228
00:27:49,838 --> 00:27:54,723
This promise,
we will never break...

229
00:27:55,265 --> 00:27:59,983
even if it angers God

230
00:28:01,444 --> 00:28:06,580
Should I call you to meet me...

231
00:28:06,956 --> 00:28:12,592
I hope you will veil your face

232
00:28:15,765 --> 00:28:20,482
Our wedding isn't very far away

233
00:28:21,317 --> 00:28:27,622
I must pine. So must you

234
00:28:29,835 --> 00:28:34,678
My heart is the problem...

235
00:28:35,137 --> 00:28:39,980
you tell me, how am I
to remain quiet?

236
00:28:50,208 --> 00:28:54,008
What are you thinking about?
- Nothing

237
00:29:00,145 --> 00:29:05,190
I'll go and change

238
00:31:41,552 --> 00:31:45,307
Who's that?

239
00:31:45,308 --> 00:31:50,145
Who is it?

240
00:31:52,574 --> 00:31:56,991
Who...?

241
00:31:57,124 --> 00:32:01,584
Who are you?

242
00:32:30,482 --> 00:32:34,984
Who is it?

243
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:13,895
What's wrong with you?

244
00:33:15,197 --> 00:33:19,204
There was so much of agony
in her cry

245
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:23,588
She's in deep trouble

246
00:33:23,589 --> 00:33:29,093
We must help her, Aditya

247
00:33:29,266 --> 00:33:32,146
We could help, if there
really was someone there

248
00:33:32,147 --> 00:33:33,691
There's no one

249
00:33:33,692 --> 00:33:37,533
I've heard her screaming.
Not once, but many times over

250
00:33:37,534 --> 00:33:40,120
You can go ahead and think
that I'm mad

251
00:33:40,121 --> 00:33:43,963
For me, however, it's as true
as you standing here before me

252
00:33:44,631 --> 00:33:48,303
If it's true, why didn't
I hear her voice?

253
00:33:48,304 --> 00:33:51,769
Why didn't I realise
her suffering?

254
00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:55,736
You've given up realising anyone's
suffering long ago, Aditya

255
00:34:04,169 --> 00:34:07,509
Sanjana! This is the root of
all your problems

256
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:10,431
You neither sleep, nor keep awake
after taking these pills

257
00:34:10,432 --> 00:34:13,647
You hear and talk any nonsense.
- I can't go to sleep without it

258
00:34:14,023 --> 00:34:17,069
So don't go to sleep.
I'll stay up with you

259
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:21,495
We'll chat and I'll hold
your hand all night

260
00:34:29,512 --> 00:34:35,398
When you should have been with me,
you kept running away from me

261
00:34:37,152 --> 00:34:41,661
Times were when I had
so much to talk you about...

262
00:34:41,662 --> 00:34:44,583
and you always chose to keep quiet

263
00:34:44,584 --> 00:34:48,465
I suffered everything in silence

264
00:34:48,466 --> 00:34:53,768
I kept awake, while you slept

265
00:34:53,769 --> 00:34:59,531
Had you steadied me then, I wouldn't
have had the need for these pills today

266
00:35:00,490 --> 00:35:04,122
But I can't do without them anymore

267
00:35:04,123 --> 00:35:08,792
I can't.

268
00:35:27,169 --> 00:35:30,550
Aditya? You?

269
00:35:30,551 --> 00:35:33,180
Without even informing us,
the Managing Director...

270
00:35:33,181 --> 00:35:36,938
of the Park chain of hotels
is here in person!

271
00:35:37,732 --> 00:35:39,985
I can't believe it

272
00:35:39,986 --> 00:35:43,785
Do I take it as a stroke of good luck
or is this an inspection, Mr M.D.?

273
00:35:43,786 --> 00:35:46,874
No M.D. A friend is here
to meet a friend

274
00:35:46,875 --> 00:35:51,592
By the way, where is your husband?

275
00:35:51,593 --> 00:35:56,894
Someone has cast an evil eye
on your love

276
00:35:56,895 --> 00:36:01,529
Your love was a shining example
for everybody in Ooty...

277
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:06,824
and you go through such problems?

278
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:13,678
She couldn't go to sleep
when you were away

279
00:36:13,679 --> 00:36:16,852
And she now swallows sleeping pills
in your presence

280
00:36:18,522 --> 00:36:21,359
I can't believe it

281
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:25,410
Sanjana's quite a wise girl.
You haven't...?

282
00:36:26,705 --> 00:36:29,961
You could say I'm the one
who's not wise enough

283
00:36:31,548 --> 00:36:35,137
I'm the one to blame
for whatever has happened

284
00:36:35,138 --> 00:36:39,563
But I want to make my love an
example for others all over again

285
00:36:39,564 --> 00:36:42,569
For this, I need help
from the two of you

286
00:36:42,570 --> 00:36:44,698
Just don't worry

287
00:36:44,699 --> 00:36:48,957
The two of us got you married.
We even gave the bride away

288
00:36:51,797 --> 00:36:56,515
It's our problem now. Just see how
we solve it between the two of us

289
00:36:57,224 --> 00:37:02,394
Where is she at the moment?

290
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:22,966
Madam...

291
00:39:24,852 --> 00:39:25,979
Who are you?

292
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:29,611
I was told at the hotel that
the two of you have arrived

293
00:39:29,612 --> 00:39:35,033
I was asked to clean the place

294
00:39:35,666 --> 00:39:39,339
Why hasn't Robert come? We've been
waiting for him since last evening

295
00:39:39,799 --> 00:39:43,222
Where has he gone?
- Even his wife doesn't know

296
00:39:43,682 --> 00:39:46,937
He's been missing for eight months.
- Eight months?

297
00:39:46,938 --> 00:39:49,944
Yes, Madam. Even the police
couldn't find him

298
00:39:50,696 --> 00:39:54,118
No one knows what's happened of him
or where he has gone

299
00:39:54,119 --> 00:39:56,540
His wife is in trouble, Madam

300
00:39:56,541 --> 00:40:00,715
Do you know where she lives?

301
00:40:00,716 --> 00:40:03,721
He had started changing

302
00:40:03,722 --> 00:40:07,646
He did very strange things

303
00:40:07,647 --> 00:40:11,571
He used to slog like an animal
in that bungalow

304
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:16,288
And suddenly, he had started dreading
the very mention of the bungalow

305
00:40:17,541 --> 00:40:21,800
He'd make some excuse or the other
to send me to do the chores

306
00:40:24,931 --> 00:40:27,769
And one day, he just vanished

307
00:40:27,770 --> 00:40:31,402
Why didn't you call and tell Aditya?
- I did, Madam

308
00:40:31,778 --> 00:40:37,914
I called him on his cell-phone
from the post office

309
00:40:37,915 --> 00:40:41,798
I also told the master that
before Robert disappeared...

310
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,972
he had started hearing
strange voices

311
00:40:45,973 --> 00:40:50,106
He used to shut his ears and
rant like a madman all day

312
00:40:51,901 --> 00:40:54,906
He used to wake me up in the
middle of the night and say...

313
00:40:54,907 --> 00:40:58,497
that unless I went out
and stopped the voices...

314
00:40:58,915 --> 00:41:02,004
he'd walk out on me

315
00:41:02,005 --> 00:41:05,971
But I could have stopped the voices
only if I heard any

316
00:41:07,725 --> 00:41:10,521
Only Robert could hear them

317
00:41:10,522 --> 00:41:14,655
What sort of voice was it?

318
00:41:14,656 --> 00:41:19,992
Of someone crying out in pain

319
00:41:26,971 --> 00:41:32,022
The fire rages on both sides

320
00:41:32,023 --> 00:41:37,861
Bodies longing to be
consumed by the fires!

321
00:41:38,870 --> 00:41:40,873
There you are...

322
00:41:40,874 --> 00:41:44,005
The fish escapes,
the shoe gets caught...

323
00:41:44,006 --> 00:41:47,804
this is how, very often,
lovers go awry

324
00:41:47,805 --> 00:41:52,474
Thank you

325
00:41:56,948 --> 00:41:59,953
On an evening...

326
00:41:59,954 --> 00:42:02,792
amidst rainfall...

327
00:42:02,793 --> 00:42:06,299
and a romantic setting...

328
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:11,100
let the song of love
be heard

329
00:42:11,101 --> 00:42:13,814
There's fire

330
00:42:13,815 --> 00:42:16,528
There's longing

331
00:42:16,529 --> 00:42:20,410
And a sense of failing balance

332
00:42:20,411 --> 00:42:26,625
Let me tell my lover
something today

333
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:57,695
All those promises we made...

334
00:42:58,738 --> 00:43:02,287
all those oaths we took together...

335
00:43:02,872 --> 00:43:08,842
you are the one who
brought dawn into my life

336
00:43:10,763 --> 00:43:15,103
Do you recollect...?

337
00:43:15,104 --> 00:43:18,528
Do you remember?

338
00:43:25,542 --> 00:43:28,757
Beautiful days we spent...

339
00:43:29,509 --> 00:43:33,390
and our nights were lovely too

340
00:43:33,975 --> 00:43:40,279
You are the one who
brought dawn into my life

341
00:43:41,699 --> 00:43:46,040
Do you remember...?

342
00:43:46,041 --> 00:43:49,632
Do you remember?

343
00:44:27,625 --> 00:44:29,711
We stayed awake all nights

344
00:44:29,712 --> 00:44:31,965
We were lost in each other

345
00:44:31,966 --> 00:44:35,389
We spoke about our love
for each other

346
00:44:36,016 --> 00:44:40,526
Out of loneliness...

347
00:44:41,026 --> 00:44:44,324
we met each other every day

348
00:44:45,536 --> 00:44:52,925
In your arms, I found solace
and spent precious moments of my life

349
00:44:54,010 --> 00:44:58,310
Your beautiful moon-like face...

350
00:44:58,770 --> 00:45:02,902
I etched on my heart

351
00:45:02,903 --> 00:45:06,451
We were so close...

352
00:45:07,036 --> 00:45:10,877
I happened to be your destiny

353
00:45:11,838 --> 00:45:17,766
On my lips was your name
all the time...

354
00:45:19,352 --> 00:45:23,861
do you remember?

355
00:45:23,862 --> 00:45:28,494
Yes, I do remember

356
00:45:28,495 --> 00:45:31,586
I do remember

357
00:46:06,948 --> 00:46:11,415
In daylight, in my dreams...

358
00:46:11,874 --> 00:46:15,423
you were the one
always in my sight

359
00:46:15,924 --> 00:46:20,474
You are my life,
you are what my story is all about...

360
00:46:20,934 --> 00:46:24,482
you are my destiny

361
00:46:24,984 --> 00:46:29,409
I loved you and
took you for my own

362
00:46:29,785 --> 00:46:33,250
You gave me a place
in your heart

363
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:41,851
With love, you lent colour
to my dreams

364
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:46,611
Your lips I kissed...

365
00:46:47,111 --> 00:46:50,994
in your arms, I swayed...

366
00:46:51,829 --> 00:46:58,258
in your eyes, I dwelt

367
00:46:59,386 --> 00:47:02,810
Do you remember?

368
00:47:03,728 --> 00:47:07,151
Yes, I do remember

369
00:47:07,903 --> 00:47:11,118
I sure do remember

370
00:47:13,915 --> 00:47:17,463
All those promises we made...

371
00:47:17,965 --> 00:47:22,348
All those oaths
we took together

372
00:47:22,850 --> 00:47:28,862
You were the only who
brought dawn into my life

373
00:47:30,448 --> 00:47:34,998
Do you remember?

374
00:47:34,999 --> 00:47:39,089
Yes, I remember

375
00:47:39,090 --> 00:47:45,012
Yes, I remember

376
00:48:39,419 --> 00:48:43,844
Did you hear the gunshot?

377
00:48:43,845 --> 00:48:48,521
Sanjana, it wasn't a gunshot.
It was the door

378
00:48:49,857 --> 00:48:54,114
No, Aditya. I heard a gunshot

379
00:48:54,115 --> 00:48:59,000
It wasn't a gunshot, Sanjana.
It was the door

380
00:49:10,899 --> 00:49:16,278
Why didn't you tell me about Robert?

381
00:49:16,744 --> 00:49:20,333
He used to hear
these noises too

382
00:49:20,334 --> 00:49:22,964
His wife telephoned you
to tell you about it

383
00:49:22,965 --> 00:49:25,970
So why did you hide it from me?

384
00:49:25,971 --> 00:49:29,936
I have so many servants, Sanjana

385
00:49:29,937 --> 00:49:33,192
Someone goes crazy,
someone disappears...

386
00:49:33,193 --> 00:49:37,744
and someone hears strange noises.
I can't keep track of everyone, can I?

387
00:50:00,749 --> 00:50:05,668
I'm tired

388
00:51:41,449 --> 00:51:44,915
This woman has been wailing away!

389
00:51:46,544 --> 00:51:49,717
You heard her. Didn't you, Madam?
Only you and I can listen to it

390
00:51:50,134 --> 00:51:54,768
Nobody else can hear it...
not my wife, not my master

391
00:51:55,144 --> 00:51:58,650
I'm fed up, Madam...
I'm fed up!

392
00:51:58,651 --> 00:52:02,826
My brains are going to explode...
these noises will blow my mind

393
00:52:03,410 --> 00:52:06,498
Save me, Madam. Please save me

394
00:52:06,499 --> 00:52:09,923
Or I'll go mad, Madam

395
00:52:10,508 --> 00:52:15,970
I'll go mad!

396
00:52:26,540 --> 00:52:30,924
The noises I hear,
the things I feel...

397
00:52:31,550 --> 00:52:36,475
why doesn't Aditya feel them too?

398
00:52:36,476 --> 00:52:40,401
I want to save my marriage.
At any cost

399
00:52:41,403 --> 00:52:44,491
I brought Aditya here
from Mumbai...

400
00:52:44,492 --> 00:52:48,041
to save our marriage
from falling apart

401
00:52:49,168 --> 00:52:53,678
But having come here, I feel
as if the rift between us...

402
00:52:54,095 --> 00:52:57,519
has widened, instead
of making up

403
00:53:00,608 --> 00:53:04,407
Sanjana, whether someone
believes you or not...

404
00:53:05,492 --> 00:53:08,582
I know you're speaking the truth

405
00:53:08,583 --> 00:53:12,590
Have you heard of Vastu Shastra?

406
00:53:12,591 --> 00:53:15,846
At times, when your house isn't
properly planned...

407
00:53:15,847 --> 00:53:19,269
you begin to get strange ideas

408
00:53:19,270 --> 00:53:23,486
Maybe this is responsible for
whatever you're going through

409
00:53:23,487 --> 00:53:25,490
Whether someone believes
it or not...

410
00:53:25,491 --> 00:53:28,496
I have faith in the
science of Vastu

411
00:53:28,497 --> 00:53:31,796
I think we must consult
Professor Agni Swaroop

412
00:53:35,512 --> 00:53:40,521
Yes. He has great insight

413
00:53:40,522 --> 00:53:45,941
And he can set right what is wrong

414
00:54:56,590 --> 00:54:58,677
Is everything all right?

415
00:54:58,678 --> 00:55:04,396
I'd like to believe
that everything is all right

416
00:55:04,397 --> 00:55:10,409
But my body says there
is something here...

417
00:55:13,456 --> 00:55:17,339
which is not right.
And the body never lies

418
00:55:18,383 --> 00:55:23,225
You might find my question strange

419
00:55:23,226 --> 00:55:28,647
But you must think before
you answer me

420
00:55:28,654 --> 00:55:30,532
Go ahead

421
00:55:30,533 --> 00:55:34,540
Do you believe in ghosts?

422
00:55:34,541 --> 00:55:38,548
In spirits? Good and evil?

423
00:55:38,549 --> 00:55:41,638
Spirits that help and
spirits that torment?

424
00:55:41,639 --> 00:55:44,686
Spirits that long to accomplish
what has remained unfinished

425
00:55:46,481 --> 00:55:49,570
Have you ever heard
of tormented souls?

426
00:55:49,571 --> 00:55:53,989
What?

427
00:55:59,340 --> 00:56:02,639
Has the breeze ever tried to whisper
something into your ears?

428
00:56:06,437 --> 00:56:09,569
You don't find things suddenly
disappearing from your sight...

429
00:56:09,570 --> 00:56:13,535
and coming back again?

430
00:56:13,536 --> 00:56:19,506
Strange voices, I mean

431
00:56:21,510 --> 00:56:24,515
A stunning cry

432
00:56:24,516 --> 00:56:29,525
Feeling of a presence,
despite being all alone

433
00:56:29,526 --> 00:56:33,576
Do you feel as if you're wide awake
and yet, you're seeing a nightmare?

434
00:56:36,456 --> 00:56:41,716
Yes... how did you get to know?

435
00:56:41,717 --> 00:56:46,559
Which means, there is someone

436
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:49,356
There is someone...

437
00:56:49,357 --> 00:56:54,534
who wants to assert himself,
despite being dead

438
00:57:05,472 --> 00:57:10,559
What's up there?

439
00:57:19,292 --> 00:57:21,671
How many days since you
opened this door?

440
00:57:21,672 --> 00:57:26,925
It's almost two years

441
00:57:42,672 --> 00:57:49,011
But it feels as if someone has
been frequenting this place

442
00:58:13,274 --> 00:58:18,242
If the lemon does not change
its colour till sunset...

443
00:58:18,243 --> 00:58:22,584
you can assume that everything
is all right

444
00:58:22,585 --> 00:58:27,385
Or else...
- Or else?

445
00:58:27,386 --> 00:58:31,728
Or else, you could
face grave problems

446
00:58:31,729 --> 00:58:35,235
Pray that the lemon does not
turn red by this evening

447
01:00:05,833 --> 01:00:09,590
I told you! There is someone!

448
01:00:09,591 --> 01:00:12,805
There is something in our house!

449
01:00:12,806 --> 01:00:15,560
Those gunshots...

450
01:00:15,561 --> 01:00:20,445
There is someone in our house, Aditya!
There's a spirit haunting our house!

451
01:00:21,990 --> 01:00:25,706
Else, Professor Agni Swaroop's lemon
would not have turned red!

452
01:00:26,583 --> 01:00:29,630
It wouldn't have turned red!

453
01:00:29,631 --> 01:00:33,680
I'm not lying, Aditya!

454
01:00:33,681 --> 01:00:37,896
Ask Priya, if you don't believe me

455
01:00:37,897 --> 01:00:41,571
There's a spirit in our house

456
01:00:41,572 --> 01:00:45,871
I have felt its presence

457
01:00:45,872 --> 01:00:48,877
Who do you think you are...?

458
01:00:48,878 --> 01:00:53,928
You're a professor? Are you?

459
01:00:53,929 --> 01:00:56,934
You make money out of scaring women!
- Mind your tongue!

460
01:00:56,935 --> 01:01:01,652
There's a ghost in my house?
Is there...?

461
01:01:01,653 --> 01:01:03,531
I'll have your blood!

462
01:01:03,532 --> 01:01:06,286
I'll report you to the police if
you even look at my house again!

463
01:01:06,287 --> 01:01:08,750
Call the police! Go ahead!

464
01:01:08,751 --> 01:01:11,797
You don't know who I am!
I'm Aditya Dhanraj!

465
01:01:11,798 --> 01:01:15,222
Call the cops!
- I've dealt with your kind!

466
01:01:22,862 --> 01:01:26,577
But why isn't he taking the phone?

467
01:01:26,578 --> 01:01:31,755
Actually, Adi and
Sanjana have gone out

468
01:01:32,590 --> 01:01:35,845
Let him not take the call,
if he doesn't want to

469
01:01:35,846 --> 01:01:39,604
I'm not fond of lecturing him
like a school kid

470
01:01:40,438 --> 01:01:44,781
lt'll be kind of him if he doesn't
ruin the respect I've built...

471
01:01:45,282 --> 01:01:48,914
over the years, in brawls
and scraps

472
01:01:49,541 --> 01:01:51,376
Yes, Uncle

473
01:01:51,377 --> 01:01:54,509
Yes, my foot! Can't you
make him see reason?

474
01:01:54,926 --> 01:01:56,929
He's no ordinary man

475
01:01:56,930 --> 01:01:59,643
The press always keep nosing around
for such stories

476
01:01:59,644 --> 01:02:01,856
They've splashed the news
on the front-page

477
01:02:01,857 --> 01:02:05,322
Anyway, I haven't called to
talk to him about his exploits

478
01:02:05,781 --> 01:02:07,951
I've something important
to discuss with him

479
01:02:07,952 --> 01:02:14,166
Yes, Uncle. I'll tell him

480
01:02:14,799 --> 01:02:17,805
Adi, you've got to
reach Bombay tomorrow

481
01:02:18,891 --> 01:02:21,562
Uncle says the delegation
from Hong Kong...

482
01:02:21,563 --> 01:02:24,025
can stay for another day
at the most

483
01:02:24,026 --> 01:02:28,409
If you don't have a meeting with them,
not only will you lose millions...

484
01:02:28,869 --> 01:02:34,045
your relations with them
will be over too

485
01:02:34,046 --> 01:02:38,764
I'm glad it happened.
I was fed up of this place anyway

486
01:02:40,058 --> 01:02:45,437
We'll take the afternoon flight back

487
01:02:47,030 --> 01:02:50,745
Priya, will you do
something for me?

488
01:02:50,746 --> 01:02:54,920
Professor, at least hear me out

489
01:02:54,921 --> 01:02:59,638
Sanjana is terribly embarrassed

490
01:02:59,639 --> 01:03:05,268
Or why would she send me here
to ask for your forgiveness?

491
01:03:06,319 --> 01:03:10,785
She herself doesn't know
what got into Aditya

492
01:03:10,786 --> 01:03:14,167
She wanted to come here to
meet you, Professor

493
01:03:14,168 --> 01:03:16,505
But there was this call
from Bombay suddenly...

494
01:03:16,506 --> 01:03:18,425
and she had to leave with Aditya

495
01:03:18,426 --> 01:03:20,805
She hasn't gone at all!

496
01:03:20,806 --> 01:03:21,807
Pardon me?

497
01:03:21,808 --> 01:03:24,980
Till that power accomplishes
what it wants to...

498
01:03:24,981 --> 01:03:29,783
forget Mumbai, it won't let
Sanjana even leave this city

499
01:03:31,703 --> 01:03:36,671
Her husband wants to
take her away, isn't it?

500
01:03:36,672 --> 01:03:37,964
So let him!

501
01:03:37,965 --> 01:03:41,012
Professor, they've already left

502
01:03:41,013 --> 01:03:45,020
They've left

503
01:03:45,021 --> 01:03:47,651
But they haven't reached there

504
01:03:47,652 --> 01:03:49,530
The road is blocked, sir.

505
01:03:49,531 --> 01:03:51,701
It'll take 5 or 6 hours
for the traffic to clear

506
01:03:51,702 --> 01:03:57,921
D'you want some tea or coffee?
- 3 cups of tea

507
01:03:57,922 --> 01:04:00,844
There's a landslide ahead, sir.
The road's blocked for 5 or 6 hours

508
01:04:00,845 --> 01:04:06,224
D'you want me to look
for a lodge for you?

509
01:04:07,482 --> 01:04:10,655
If there are unseasonal rains
or a storm, or a fog...

510
01:04:10,656 --> 01:04:14,163
descending in summer, what can
you or I do against an act of God?

511
01:04:14,539 --> 01:04:17,586
You're being funny!
It's a contract worth millions

512
01:04:17,587 --> 01:04:22,596
If I don't get to Mumbai by tomorrow
morning, I'll have lost everything

513
01:04:22,597 --> 01:04:25,603
You can't get a flight from Ooty.
You'll have to drive to Coimbatore

514
01:04:25,936 --> 01:04:29,651
But there has to be a way.
Some way

515
01:04:29,652 --> 01:04:32,657
No, nothing can be
done about it today

516
01:04:32,658 --> 01:04:34,870
Even if we were to have a chopper
flown in from Bangalore...

517
01:04:34,871 --> 01:04:37,751
it'd take us a day to get
clearance from the army

518
01:04:37,752 --> 01:04:39,922
So call your father.
He'll handle everything

519
01:04:39,923 --> 01:04:43,971
No way. I don't want to
listen to his sermons again

520
01:04:43,972 --> 01:04:47,688
Suppose I take a flight from Bangalore,
instead of Coimbatore?

521
01:04:50,276 --> 01:04:52,656
I must take the flight from
Bangalore tomorrow morning

522
01:04:52,657 --> 01:04:54,743
For that, I'll have to drive
all night through Madhu Malai...

523
01:04:54,744 --> 01:04:57,039
to reach Bangalore at
six tomorrow morning

524
01:04:57,040 --> 01:05:00,171
It isn't a safe road. And you...
- Go ahead, Aditya

525
01:05:01,173 --> 01:05:06,552
I'll wait here for you

526
01:05:12,864 --> 01:05:18,701
As soon as my work is over,
I'll rush here

527
01:05:19,209 --> 01:05:22,674
And don't you dare take those
sleeping pills in my absence

528
01:05:22,675 --> 01:05:26,139
I don't want you to see ghosts
all over again

529
01:05:26,140 --> 01:05:30,440
The ghost's actually in the bottle.
Let it remain there

530
01:05:45,261 --> 01:05:48,266
Stop being stubborn
and pack your bags

531
01:05:48,267 --> 01:05:50,647
I can't leave you alone
in this house

532
01:05:50,648 --> 01:05:54,656
Please, Priya. Go away. I want to
stay here and find out the truth

533
01:05:55,281 --> 01:05:57,786
What truth are you talking about?

534
01:05:57,787 --> 01:06:03,464
Professor Agni has told you
that there's a spirit here

535
01:06:03,924 --> 01:06:07,388
You have yourself seen
the lemon change colors

536
01:06:07,389 --> 01:06:10,144
And even if what
he says is not true...

537
01:06:10,145 --> 01:06:12,314
where's the need for you
to take the risk?

538
01:06:12,315 --> 01:06:14,903
There is a need

539
01:06:14,904 --> 01:06:18,452
I want to find out whether a spirit
is indeed trying to talk to me...

540
01:06:18,912 --> 01:06:21,416
or is it a streak of madness

541
01:06:21,417 --> 01:06:24,674
I want to know whether what I have
felt through the days and nights...

542
01:06:25,258 --> 01:06:28,599
is true, or is it an effect
of the sleeping pills I consume

543
01:06:29,726 --> 01:06:32,939
I want to find out whether what
Professor Agni says is true...

544
01:06:32,940 --> 01:06:37,741
or is Aditya? It's necessary
for me to have the answers

545
01:06:37,742 --> 01:06:41,992
Very necessary

546
01:10:28,829 --> 01:10:33,002
Who are you?

547
01:10:33,003 --> 01:10:35,800
It's my house!

548
01:10:35,801 --> 01:10:39,266
So long as I live, I will not
let you take over my house!

549
01:10:40,017 --> 01:10:43,859
If you think you can drive me
away by scaring me...

550
01:10:44,484 --> 01:10:46,487
it's just not happening!

551
01:10:46,488 --> 01:10:49,493
I'm not going to be scared!

552
01:10:49,494 --> 01:10:52,585
Till such time as I live,
you can't snatch my house from me!

553
01:10:55,381 --> 01:11:01,011
You're going to leave this place.
Not I!

554
01:12:56,958 --> 01:13:00,130
Go away!

555
01:13:00,131 --> 01:13:03,304
Tell your friend that
I don't want any trouble

556
01:13:03,555 --> 01:13:07,102
I'm a simple man.
Let me get on with my life

557
01:13:07,103 --> 01:13:09,816
I don't want to meddle in
anybody's family affairs

558
01:13:09,817 --> 01:13:13,658
But, Professor, you must...
- Not another word from you! Shut up!

559
01:13:14,367 --> 01:13:17,372
You think I will help you again?

560
01:13:17,373 --> 01:13:20,378
So her husband will get
physical with me again?

561
01:13:20,379 --> 01:13:23,384
This time, I will raise my hand too

562
01:13:23,385 --> 01:13:24,721
No.

563
01:13:24,722 --> 01:13:27,769
Get out!

564
01:13:27,770 --> 01:13:33,649
I've seen her for myself, Professor

565
01:13:35,326 --> 01:13:39,209
I've seen its face.
It's a woman

566
01:13:46,348 --> 01:13:48,560
What's all this about, Professor?

567
01:13:48,561 --> 01:13:51,525
Earlier, she only
got hear the voices

568
01:13:51,526 --> 01:13:57,197
And now she's seeing things!
What's happening?

569
01:14:07,140 --> 01:14:10,437
You're not connected with
that incident, are you?

570
01:14:10,438 --> 01:14:14,940
Which incident?

571
01:14:17,452 --> 01:14:21,208
This incident took place
in the forests behind your house

572
01:14:21,209 --> 01:14:25,969
Exactly where you
heard the gunshot

573
01:14:31,648 --> 01:14:35,320
It happened on May 16

574
01:14:35,321 --> 01:14:38,369
On the same night, you met
with an accident too

575
01:14:40,331 --> 01:14:43,671
About two hours
after this tragedy

576
01:14:43,672 --> 01:14:47,136
On recovering, you insisted that
you come to Ooty with your husband

577
01:14:48,723 --> 01:14:52,523
Whereas, your husband was willing to
take you to any part of the world

578
01:14:53,983 --> 01:14:56,613
What does that mean?

579
01:14:56,614 --> 01:14:59,869
The spirit in your house and
the spirit which killed Nisha...

580
01:14:59,870 --> 01:15:03,335
are one and the same.
- Which means, she's after me?

581
01:15:05,632 --> 01:15:10,134
I don't know

582
01:15:11,561 --> 01:15:16,486
I don't know whether
she wants to harm you

583
01:15:20,411 --> 01:15:23,458
But one thing is for sure

584
01:15:23,459 --> 01:15:27,466
She wants to say something to you

585
01:15:27,467 --> 01:15:33,269
She wants to tell you something.
- What?

586
01:15:33,270 --> 01:15:38,899
We can decide that only when
we get to the spot

587
01:15:56,316 --> 01:15:59,614
Over there

588
01:15:59,615 --> 01:16:03,705
The boy took me there

589
01:16:03,706 --> 01:16:09,628
You've got to go there.
On your own

590
01:16:11,639 --> 01:16:15,939
If you think I'm scared
to go there myself...

591
01:16:17,651 --> 01:16:23,030
you are not entirely wrong

592
01:16:24,497 --> 01:16:27,587
But believe me...

593
01:16:27,588 --> 01:16:30,635
that isn't the only reason why
I'm sending you there on your own

594
01:16:31,219 --> 01:16:36,056
What else is it?

595
01:16:39,402 --> 01:16:42,533
Whoever it is...

596
01:16:42,534 --> 01:16:46,583
she wants to talk to her

597
01:16:46,584 --> 01:16:51,635
There is something she wants
to tell only Sanjana

598
01:16:51,636 --> 01:16:55,768
If she wants to meet her...

599
01:16:55,769 --> 01:16:59,776
she'll have to go all alone

600
01:16:59,777 --> 01:17:03,659
We'll stay here. In the car

601
01:17:03,660 --> 01:17:07,249
We're not staying here.
We're going with her

602
01:17:07,250 --> 01:17:12,009
Priya, I'll go there.
On my own

603
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:20,061
Sanjana, you're...
- Please, Priya

604
01:18:31,334 --> 01:18:36,343
What do you want?

605
01:18:36,344 --> 01:18:41,473
What are you getting at?

606
01:18:44,612 --> 01:18:49,621
You wanted me to come here

607
01:18:49,622 --> 01:18:54,624
And here I am

608
01:18:59,390 --> 01:19:03,934
Now tell me

609
01:19:06,572 --> 01:19:10,948
Speak

610
01:19:57,674 --> 01:20:02,593
Professor, I think...

611
01:22:24,593 --> 01:22:29,184
You're right. That gun
was bought from this shop

612
01:22:29,185 --> 01:22:32,106
On the 2nd of September, 1988

613
01:22:32,107 --> 01:22:34,612
After that, till March 2000...

614
01:22:34,613 --> 01:22:37,618
it was brought here for
servicing, every six months

615
01:22:37,619 --> 01:22:40,414
For a year and half now,
this gun wasn't sent here

616
01:22:40,415 --> 01:22:43,672
Whose gun is it?
Who holds the licence?

617
01:22:43,673 --> 01:22:46,886
It's a retired army colonel

618
01:22:46,887 --> 01:22:49,474
He had bought the gun
for his personal use

619
01:22:49,475 --> 01:22:54,986
What's the colonel's name?
- Colonel Arjun Malik

620
01:22:54,987 --> 01:22:59,322
The address?

621
01:23:03,838 --> 01:23:06,509
Yes?

622
01:23:06,510 --> 01:23:11,179
One moment, Madam

623
01:23:21,832 --> 01:23:26,835
Sir, there's a call for you

624
01:23:34,398 --> 01:23:38,240
I've found the gun
you used to kill an innocent

625
01:23:38,658 --> 01:23:40,409
What rubbish are you talking?

626
01:23:40,410 --> 01:23:43,625
Colt 8mm, Serial FB66

627
01:23:43,626 --> 01:23:48,760
That's the number of
your gun, isn't it?

628
01:23:48,761 --> 01:23:52,017
I don't have the time
to listen to your nonsense

629
01:23:54,105 --> 01:23:58,279
Don't hang up on me!

630
01:23:58,280 --> 01:24:01,912
What you have done has made life
miserable for me and my husband

631
01:24:02,539 --> 01:24:05,962
My life is plunged in turmoil for
the disgusting things you've done!

632
01:24:06,462 --> 01:24:11,639
To overcome my problems,
I'll have to meet you

633
01:24:11,640 --> 01:24:15,105
What if I choose not to meet you?

634
01:24:15,773 --> 01:24:19,029
In which case, I'll hand
the gun to the police

635
01:24:19,030 --> 01:24:25,411
The police will find out
whom you killed and why

636
01:24:25,710 --> 01:24:29,008
All right.
Tomorrow at eleven

637
01:24:37,149 --> 01:24:40,112
Where did you find the gun?
And in what circumstances?

638
01:24:40,113 --> 01:24:42,826
Why did you kill the girl?
And under what circumstances?

639
01:24:42,827 --> 01:24:45,832
Don't talk like a moron!
Why would I kill her?

640
01:24:45,833 --> 01:24:49,130
Because this just what
people like you always do

641
01:24:49,131 --> 01:24:52,471
You trap innocent girls, make
them victims of your lust...

642
01:24:52,847 --> 01:24:56,312
and once you've had enough of them,
you silence them with the gun...

643
01:24:56,730 --> 01:25:01,573
so that you can keep your
ugly face hidden behind a mask!

644
01:25:03,076 --> 01:25:07,877
No father on earth can do to his
daughter, what you say I've done!

645
01:25:23,074 --> 01:25:26,038
She was my daughter

646
01:25:26,039 --> 01:25:30,088
But as my daughter,
she gave me no comfort

647
01:25:30,798 --> 01:25:35,139
She was mentally ill

648
01:25:35,140 --> 01:25:39,147
I had her admitted to
the asylum several times

649
01:25:39,148 --> 01:25:42,738
But she would always escape

650
01:25:42,739 --> 01:25:46,370
She once locked me up
in my own room...

651
01:25:46,371 --> 01:25:49,376
and ran away. Forever

652
01:25:49,377 --> 01:25:54,053
After she had left, I discovered
that my revolver was missing

653
01:25:55,180 --> 01:25:59,313
I lodged a complaint with the police,
I had ads published in the papers...

654
01:26:00,023 --> 01:26:05,110
I looked for her everywhere

655
01:26:08,164 --> 01:26:14,468
And my search came to end
when you telephoned me

656
01:26:18,309 --> 01:26:23,069
It was obvious that my daughter
would never come back to me

657
01:26:28,998 --> 01:26:32,505
The Colonel's daughter goes missing,
she then dies...

658
01:26:33,173 --> 01:26:37,299
and her spirit then compels you
to come here from Mumbai

659
01:26:37,724 --> 01:26:41,271
She shows you the gun and
tells you her address

660
01:26:41,272 --> 01:26:45,237
What is more, you even
get to see her

661
01:26:45,238 --> 01:26:49,204
Why's she doing all this?

662
01:26:49,205 --> 01:26:52,460
We have no way of finding out

663
01:26:52,461 --> 01:26:54,799
There is a way

664
01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:58,222
There's no need for you
to go to her anymore

665
01:26:58,223 --> 01:27:01,478
If you wish, she could come to you

666
01:27:01,479 --> 01:27:05,111
With the help of this book

667
01:27:05,112 --> 01:27:10,490
But you will be playing with death

668
01:27:12,209 --> 01:27:17,219
To begin with, you must chant
the mantras in that book...

669
01:27:17,637 --> 01:27:22,103
and summon her when
you're all alone

670
01:27:22,104 --> 01:27:25,862
Another thing: Such spirits
are very stubborn

671
01:27:29,034 --> 01:27:33,543
She will come at your behest

672
01:27:33,544 --> 01:27:35,964
But she will leave
only when she wants to

673
01:27:35,965 --> 01:27:38,427
What if she refuses to leave?

674
01:27:38,428 --> 01:27:44,064
In that case, Sanjana will meet
with the same fate as Nisha

675
01:27:47,697 --> 01:27:51,036
Think it over

676
01:27:51,037 --> 01:27:54,209
I've decided, Professor

677
01:27:54,210 --> 01:27:58,217
Her secret is somehow
connected with my secret

678
01:27:58,218 --> 01:28:01,558
I want to know why she's playing
these games with me

679
01:28:02,936 --> 01:28:06,819
What made her call me here
all the way from Mumbai?

680
01:28:07,277 --> 01:28:10,785
Till such time as I have the answer,
I will have no peace

681
01:28:11,202 --> 01:28:15,962
I want to meet her, look
into her eyes, and ask her

682
01:28:16,630 --> 01:28:19,885
Even if I have to lay down my life

683
01:28:19,886 --> 01:28:24,019
There's a particular way of reading
this book. I'll explain it to you

684
01:31:17,157 --> 01:31:20,372
Feelings help me
to overcome distances

685
01:31:25,173 --> 01:31:27,343
Extend a hand...

686
01:31:27,344 --> 01:31:29,556
so I may touch you

687
01:31:29,557 --> 01:31:35,770
You've even started drinking now?

688
01:31:38,366 --> 01:31:41,998
Intoxication finds new heights
when you drink

689
01:31:44,211 --> 01:31:47,760
Tonight is a night of mischief

690
01:31:51,643 --> 01:31:58,024
Tonight, I won't be able
to sleep without you

691
01:32:05,378 --> 01:32:10,304
You had left me far away

692
01:32:10,305 --> 01:32:15,767
All alone. In despair

693
01:32:16,442 --> 01:32:20,575
You have made me pine so much

694
01:32:20,576 --> 01:32:25,376
But tonight isn't a night of pining.
We ought to shower love

695
01:32:28,383 --> 01:32:33,560
For ages, this dry parched earth
hasn't had a drop of water

696
01:32:34,604 --> 01:32:40,775
Tonight, however,
it will see a storm

697
01:32:43,664 --> 01:32:47,337
Don't say anything...
just listen to me

698
01:32:48,464 --> 01:32:51,469
Let the fires rage

699
01:32:51,470 --> 01:32:54,475
Let me be charred

700
01:32:54,476 --> 01:32:57,984
For very long, this spark
has been buried in the embers

701
01:33:01,365 --> 01:33:04,580
You're acting like a nervous child

702
01:33:04,581 --> 01:33:10,340
It's not the first time
we're doing it

703
01:33:10,341 --> 01:33:16,722
I won't let your wife know anything
even this time

704
01:33:30,423 --> 01:33:35,051
Who's dead?

705
01:33:37,229 --> 01:33:41,897
Who's dead?

706
01:33:42,113 --> 01:33:47,534
What have you been hiding from me?

707
01:33:50,463 --> 01:33:54,555
Who was she?

708
01:33:54,556 --> 01:34:00,399
Who was she, I say!

709
01:34:00,400 --> 01:34:04,818
Who?

710
01:34:08,457 --> 01:34:12,508
The last time I came to Ooty,
it was raining very heavily

711
01:34:16,223 --> 01:34:21,977
What I didn't know was that the
storm would walk right up to my door

712
01:34:33,675 --> 01:34:38,970
I've lost my way

713
01:34:40,523 --> 01:34:45,567
Will you please help me?

714
01:34:48,539 --> 01:34:53,166
Come on in

715
01:34:57,598 --> 01:35:02,934
It's cold outside

716
01:35:04,111 --> 01:35:06,406
You're drenched

717
01:35:06,407 --> 01:35:10,415
Sit by the fireplace, I'll
arrange some clothes for you

718
01:35:32,459 --> 01:35:37,468
This is all I could find.
You'll have to manage

719
01:35:37,469 --> 01:35:39,472
On a cold night...

720
01:35:39,473 --> 01:35:43,189
when I'm feeling mischievous and
carry the burden of sleepiness...

721
01:35:43,649 --> 01:35:47,113
I'd have gone away to my house,
if I were in my city

722
01:35:47,531 --> 01:35:50,536
Pardon me?

723
01:35:50,537 --> 01:35:54,670
You're not going to ask me
to leave, are you?

724
01:35:54,671 --> 01:35:57,091
On a night like this,
I just don't feel like...

725
01:35:57,092 --> 01:36:02,476
leaving this fireplace
and going out

726
01:36:02,477 --> 01:36:05,985
There's a guest-room here.
You can rest there, if you wish

727
01:37:00,259 --> 01:37:03,599
Despite putting all the woes
in the world together...

728
01:37:03,600 --> 01:37:07,481
when nature still couldn't
achieve anything...

729
01:37:07,482 --> 01:37:13,654
it gave you those eyes

730
01:37:15,456 --> 01:37:19,339
There's so much of feeling
in your eyes

731
01:37:21,468 --> 01:37:26,228
I made this tune as an acknowledgement
of your loneliness

732
01:37:48,439 --> 01:37:51,863
Distances between hearts are
overcome with feelings

733
01:37:53,617 --> 01:37:55,745
Say nothing tonight

734
01:37:55,746 --> 01:37:59,962
Just savour your loneliness

735
01:38:41,588 --> 01:38:44,802
Heat and desires
burn out in failure

736
01:38:45,554 --> 01:38:49,603
Like the lamp,
I burn every night

737
01:38:49,604 --> 01:38:53,194
The lamp that burns
for everybody to see...

738
01:38:53,737 --> 01:38:57,619
is the flame that
consigns me to anonymity

739
01:38:57,620 --> 01:39:01,126
Whenever your name
appears with mine...

740
01:39:01,753 --> 01:39:05,844
I wonder why people
burn with envy - Malini

741
01:39:15,531 --> 01:39:20,540
If the Board of Directors' meeting
is not held tomorrow...

742
01:39:20,541 --> 01:39:22,836
One moment

743
01:39:22,837 --> 01:39:27,964
I'll call you later

744
01:40:26,548 --> 01:40:31,133
Don't stop

745
01:41:04,749 --> 01:41:10,795
Don't get so close to me.
I could destroy you

746
01:41:10,928 --> 01:41:16,098
And I want to be destroyed

747
01:41:43,200 --> 01:41:47,584
In love with you,
I have begun to blossom

748
01:41:49,254 --> 01:41:52,385
A look at you...

749
01:41:53,053 --> 01:41:58,432
and I have begun to flower

750
01:42:01,445 --> 01:42:07,081
Such is the manner in which
I've fallen in love with you...

751
01:42:07,457 --> 01:42:12,801
I'm going to pieces

752
01:42:13,469 --> 01:42:19,356
In love with you,
I have begun to blossom

753
01:43:14,925 --> 01:43:19,476
Should you make me
suffer like this...

754
01:43:20,979 --> 01:43:25,530
my longing will drive me mad

755
01:43:26,949 --> 01:43:32,335
I've found the one
I've been looking for

756
01:43:33,045 --> 01:43:38,932
I was restless, I was thirsty
through many lifetimes

757
01:43:41,646 --> 01:43:47,073
From our bodies,
we're becoming one in soul

758
01:43:59,765 --> 01:44:05,109
Such is the manner in which
I've fallen in love with you...

759
01:44:06,027 --> 01:44:11,037
I've begun to go to pieces

760
01:44:11,956 --> 01:44:17,885
In love with you,
I have begun to blossom

761
01:45:13,120 --> 01:45:18,380
Our bodies will melt

762
01:45:19,132 --> 01:45:23,975
The fires will rage...
our hearts will go berserk

763
01:45:25,144 --> 01:45:28,357
Should my lips meet yours...

764
01:45:28,358 --> 01:45:33,786
sparks will emanate
even from the dew

765
01:45:40,049 --> 01:45:45,977
We're crossing all limits, my love

766
01:45:58,252 --> 01:46:03,387
Such is my love for you...

767
01:46:04,138 --> 01:46:09,650
I'm going to pieces

768
01:46:16,413 --> 01:46:21,924
In love with you,
I have begun to blossom

769
01:47:09,895 --> 01:47:14,898
What's wrong with you?

770
01:47:20,792 --> 01:47:25,753
It's not loaded

771
01:47:27,096 --> 01:47:32,141
Where did you get the gun from?

772
01:47:32,189 --> 01:47:38,745
I lead the life of a wanderer.
What I might need and when...

773
01:47:40,122 --> 01:47:43,128
and when I might need this...
who knows?

774
01:47:47,136 --> 01:47:49,974
Not every man is as decent...

775
01:47:49,975 --> 01:47:53,231
as good looking and
as honest as you are

776
01:48:07,051 --> 01:48:10,725
It takes time for the romance to go
out of the lives of married couples

777
01:48:13,188 --> 01:48:16,194
And you've stopped telephoning me
in just a year or two

778
01:48:23,876 --> 01:48:27,215
I swear, I was about
to give you a call

779
01:48:27,216 --> 01:48:29,595
I'm glad you called instead

780
01:48:29,596 --> 01:48:35,142
It's difficult to get through
from Ooty

781
01:48:36,317 --> 01:48:41,821
Are you alone, Aditya?

782
01:48:41,871 --> 01:48:43,164
What does that mean?

783
01:48:43,165 --> 01:48:48,544
Is someone else there with you?

784
01:48:51,056 --> 01:48:52,348
Yes, there is

785
01:48:52,349 --> 01:48:57,645
Who? Is it Ajay?

786
01:49:00,784 --> 01:49:06,121
Me. And my loneliness

787
01:49:06,127 --> 01:49:09,257
My cellphone is ringing.
I'll call you in a while

788
01:49:09,258 --> 01:49:14,262
No... I'll call you

789
01:49:24,247 --> 01:49:29,006
Thank you. Thank you for the honour

790
01:49:31,386 --> 01:49:34,851
You're an amazing man

791
01:49:34,852 --> 01:49:37,940
You can share my bed with me

792
01:49:37,941 --> 01:49:41,196
But you just wouldn't want
the world to know about it

793
01:49:41,197 --> 01:49:44,035
And the fool that I am...

794
01:49:44,036 --> 01:49:48,002
I thought you were different
from other men

795
01:49:48,003 --> 01:49:50,006
I was so wrong

796
01:49:50,007 --> 01:49:54,098
Aditya, why haven't you
told your wife about me?

797
01:49:56,311 --> 01:50:01,028
Why didn't you tell her that
you're with me right now?

798
01:50:01,029 --> 01:50:05,036
You're scared of her, aren't you?

799
01:50:05,037 --> 01:50:10,666
Aren't you...? Right?

800
01:50:12,301 --> 01:50:17,269
Don't stand there like a dumb animal!
Answer my question, Aditya. Answer me!

801
01:50:19,232 --> 01:50:22,320
Coward! Chicken!

802
01:50:22,321 --> 01:50:26,906
Eunuch!

803
01:50:54,595 --> 01:50:57,473
I'm wiping out every trace
of that bitch...

804
01:50:57,474 --> 01:51:03,146
whom you don't forget
even in your dreams!

805
01:51:04,155 --> 01:51:07,746
You're with me only in body.
You soul's always with that bitch!

806
01:51:08,163 --> 01:51:12,004
Cut the melodrama, Malini!
- I'll drive her out of your life

807
01:51:12,379 --> 01:51:15,636
Out of your house, and your mind!

808
01:51:15,637 --> 01:51:21,766
If I still can't drive her away,
I'll burn that bitch alive!

809
01:51:52,502 --> 01:51:56,552
I beg you. Don't compel me
to do such things

810
01:51:59,516 --> 01:52:02,939
For the decency I had to let you
stay at this house...

811
01:52:03,398 --> 01:52:08,115
please leave in a decent manner

812
01:52:08,116 --> 01:52:12,876
I want to forget whatever
has happened between us

813
01:52:26,235 --> 01:52:29,199
I'm not a line written
in pencil...

814
01:52:29,200 --> 01:52:32,539
that you can erase
any time you wish to

815
01:52:32,540 --> 01:52:35,755
Listen to what I say very
carefully, Aditya Dhanraj

816
01:52:37,216 --> 01:52:41,349
I'm going to snatch you
from the bitch, come what may

817
01:52:46,317 --> 01:52:48,530
This is enough

818
01:52:48,531 --> 01:52:51,493
Leave me alone, Aditya!
Leave me alone!

819
01:52:51,494 --> 01:52:56,915
You can't do this to me, Aditya!

820
01:53:00,220 --> 01:53:03,893
Open the door, Aditya!

821
01:53:03,894 --> 01:53:07,191
You've thrown me out of the house
for the sake of that bitch!

822
01:53:07,192 --> 01:53:11,408
I wouldn't even spit at you!

823
01:53:11,409 --> 01:53:16,538
To hell with you, Aditya Dhanraj!

824
01:54:35,494 --> 01:54:39,292
Get out of my way, please

825
01:54:39,293 --> 01:54:42,759
I shouldn't have done such a thing.
Never

826
01:54:43,886 --> 01:54:46,264
Hit me, if you wish to...

827
01:54:46,265 --> 01:54:49,647
but please don't be angry with me

828
01:54:49,648 --> 01:54:52,779
For all the love you gave me,
what did I do to you?

829
01:54:54,323 --> 01:54:56,536
I'm so ashamed!

830
01:54:56,537 --> 01:54:58,330
But I can't help it, Aditya

831
01:54:58,331 --> 01:55:01,420
Whenever I imagine you with that
woman, it sets my blood boiling

832
01:55:01,421 --> 01:55:03,842
I wish you were not married to her

833
01:55:03,843 --> 01:55:07,767
I wish I could erase memories of
every moment you spent with her

834
01:55:08,184 --> 01:55:12,317
I wish she had never touched you.
I wish you belonged only to me...

835
01:55:15,073 --> 01:55:18,287
Sanjana is my wife. She has a right
to my body and my soul...

836
01:55:18,288 --> 01:55:22,921
notjust in this lifetime
but every time I'm born

837
01:55:22,922 --> 01:55:25,552
Hear me out, Aditya... please!

838
01:55:25,553 --> 01:55:29,059
Please don't leave me...
listen to me!

839
01:55:29,477 --> 01:55:35,899
Don't go away, Aditya

840
01:55:36,365 --> 01:55:42,538
Don't leave me, Aditya... please
- Get lost!

841
01:55:53,609 --> 01:55:56,614
What are you doing?

842
01:55:56,615 --> 01:55:59,160
What do you take me for?

843
01:55:59,161 --> 01:56:02,669
I'll wipe out every memory you have
for that woman in your heart!

844
01:56:04,255 --> 01:56:07,426
I won't let you show your back
to your love and run away!

845
01:56:07,427 --> 01:56:10,809
I won't let anyone
snatch you from me!

846
01:56:10,810 --> 01:56:14,024
You belong only to me...
only to me!

847
01:56:20,245 --> 01:56:23,669
We'll have to provide better
facilities to our customers...

848
01:56:24,211 --> 01:56:28,428
we'll have to renovate the hotel;
we'll have to do the landscaping again

849
01:56:29,305 --> 01:56:32,310
And we'll have to change the
interiors of the entire hotel

850
01:56:32,311 --> 01:56:36,527
It's going to cost us
about 20 million rupees

851
01:56:36,528 --> 01:56:41,572
What do you think, Aditya?

852
01:56:44,544 --> 01:56:49,880
Should we take such a big risk?

853
01:57:42,869 --> 01:57:47,955
How dare you come here again?

854
01:57:48,505 --> 01:57:52,386
Just one difference between me
and that bitch, isn't it?

855
01:57:52,387 --> 01:57:57,808
She wears this collar
around her neck, right?

856
01:57:59,026 --> 01:58:03,535
Tie it around my neck.
Tell her everything about me

857
01:58:04,704 --> 01:58:07,668
Tell her that I'm the one
you really love

858
01:58:07,669 --> 01:58:10,882
You're out of your mind.
Go away, else...

859
01:58:10,883 --> 01:58:14,305
I have very little time, Aditya

860
01:58:14,306 --> 01:58:16,769
The police have found my jeep

861
01:58:16,770 --> 01:58:19,274
My Papa will come here,
if he gets to know

862
01:58:19,275 --> 01:58:21,654
I don't want to go back
to the institution

863
01:58:21,655 --> 01:58:23,783
Put that gun away, Malini

864
01:58:23,784 --> 01:58:26,914
Make that telephone call quickly

865
01:58:26,915 --> 01:58:29,712
Tell her that we can't live
without each other

866
01:58:29,713 --> 01:58:35,091
Go on. Call her quickly

867
01:58:36,893 --> 01:58:40,651
Skip this madness. I'm not
doing anything of that sort

868
01:58:42,362 --> 01:58:45,661
Put that gun away.
- You're the one acting mad, Aditya

869
01:58:46,788 --> 01:58:50,086
You know very well that we can't
live without each other. Don't you?

870
01:58:51,380 --> 01:58:55,430
This lifetime and every time
we are born...

871
01:58:56,015 --> 01:58:59,813
you will belong only to me.
So tell her that

872
01:58:59,814 --> 01:59:02,819
You have accepted me
of your own volition

873
01:59:02,820 --> 01:59:07,580
Till she starts believing that
I'm the woman you really love...

874
01:59:08,666 --> 01:59:11,754
she's not going away
from our lives

875
01:59:11,755 --> 01:59:15,680
Go on now. Tell her...
make that call

876
01:59:18,686 --> 01:59:21,272
Make that call!

877
01:59:21,273 --> 01:59:24,697
Malini, I love my wife very much

878
01:59:24,698 --> 01:59:27,995
And I'm not going to tell her
about you and me. Never

879
01:59:28,706 --> 01:59:31,376
You mustn't make the mistake
of doing that either

880
01:59:31,377 --> 01:59:35,636
Because she loves me so much...
she won't ever believe you

881
01:59:36,387 --> 01:59:39,768
Not even if she finds
my corpse in this house?

882
01:59:39,769 --> 01:59:41,772
Put that gun away. Right now!

883
01:59:41,773 --> 01:59:44,820
She's bound to know, Aditya

884
01:59:44,821 --> 01:59:51,244
While I live, or after I die

885
02:00:00,853 --> 02:00:03,440
I had never imagined...

886
02:00:03,441 --> 02:00:07,407
that her madness and obsession
would go to such lengths

887
02:00:08,911 --> 02:00:13,377
That one gunshot blasted my power
of reasoning and my good sense

888
02:00:14,881 --> 02:00:19,264
It was only Robert I could
look to, for some loyalty

889
02:00:20,475 --> 02:00:24,358
With his help, I then did
what I thought was right

890
02:00:25,945 --> 02:00:29,243
We buried her body in the forest

891
02:00:33,502 --> 02:00:36,966
How many people would believe
I was speaking the truth?

892
02:00:36,967 --> 02:00:41,852
The manner in which she was
living with me, a married man...

893
02:00:43,146 --> 02:00:47,154
would only suggest that she had
not committed suicide...

894
02:00:48,197 --> 02:00:50,660
that I had killed her

895
02:00:50,661 --> 02:00:54,042
What would I tell the police?
What would I tell Papa?

896
02:00:56,046 --> 02:00:58,216
And you...

897
02:00:58,217 --> 02:01:02,350
I didn't tell you about it
because I didn't want to lose you

898
02:01:03,937 --> 02:01:06,942
It was as if I wasn't
burying Malini's body...

899
02:01:06,943 --> 02:01:11,368
I was burying the fear of
being separated from you

900
02:01:18,592 --> 02:01:23,476
I can't imagine a life without you
Because...

901
02:01:29,614 --> 02:01:32,869
I love you very dearly, Sanjana

902
02:01:32,870 --> 02:01:37,963
I must compliment you on
your nerve, Aditya Dhanraj

903
02:01:37,964 --> 02:01:45,353
Behind my back, on my own bed,
you had a great time with a whore

904
02:01:46,355 --> 02:01:49,653
And yet, you claim to be
in love with me?

905
02:01:49,654 --> 02:01:55,165
After mercilessly crushing my love
in this very bed...

906
02:01:56,000 --> 02:02:01,135
you want me to forget everything
and accept you...?

907
02:02:01,970 --> 02:02:04,558
And take you in my arms?

908
02:02:04,559 --> 02:02:07,271
I won't be able to carry out
the farce, Aditya

909
02:02:07,272 --> 02:02:12,867
I ask for your forgiveness, Sanjana.
Please... forgive me

910
02:02:14,036 --> 02:02:17,877
Forgive your husband, Sanjana.
- I find you repulsive

911
02:02:19,964 --> 02:02:24,389
I cried before you for so many days,
I suffered...

912
02:02:25,058 --> 02:02:28,899
and you kept spurning me,
instead of telling me the truth

913
02:02:30,026 --> 02:02:34,911
To keep our marriage alive,
I begged for your love

914
02:02:35,996 --> 02:02:40,003
And you kept rejecting me

915
02:02:40,004 --> 02:02:44,429
And now, when the shadows of
your past have begun to haunt me...

916
02:02:45,014 --> 02:02:48,604
when I've begun to
hear those screams...

917
02:02:48,605 --> 02:02:53,406
you try to prove that I was a liar.
Whereas you are the liar, Aditya

918
02:02:54,199 --> 02:02:58,917
And I can never forget a liar.
Never!

919
02:03:35,365 --> 02:03:40,208
You have a lovable face...

920
02:03:41,043 --> 02:03:44,884
I could die for it

921
02:03:46,095 --> 02:03:52,357
You do not know how much I love you

922
02:03:56,950 --> 02:04:01,250
You have a loveable face...

923
02:04:01,960 --> 02:04:05,884
I could die for you

924
02:04:31,268 --> 02:04:36,780
This journey of love
is a difficult one

925
02:04:42,123 --> 02:04:47,718
He who steadies himself
after falling...

926
02:04:48,177 --> 02:04:52,268
finds his goal

927
02:04:52,937 --> 02:04:58,489
No matter how difficult
our path is...

928
02:04:59,157 --> 02:05:02,873
we happily walk through it

929
02:05:14,104 --> 02:05:18,362
For your lovable face...

930
02:05:19,114 --> 02:05:24,284
I could even lay down
my life

931
02:05:28,759 --> 02:05:31,054
That's a good thing you did, Sanjana

932
02:05:31,055 --> 02:05:34,687
In your shoes, I'd have
done the same thing

933
02:05:35,773 --> 02:05:40,280
I couldn't imagine that Aditya was
capable of doing something so hideous

934
02:05:40,281 --> 02:05:42,159
You must never return to him

935
02:05:42,160 --> 02:05:45,833
Don't ever make that mistake, Sanjana

936
02:05:45,834 --> 02:05:52,055
That is just what that woman wants.
I can understand it all. Everything!

937
02:05:53,140 --> 02:05:55,895
Why did she draw you here
from Mumbai?

938
02:05:55,896 --> 02:05:58,609
Why did she always try
to talk to you?

939
02:05:58,610 --> 02:06:02,032
Why did she expose your
husband's secret to you?

940
02:06:02,033 --> 02:06:05,038
She wants you and Aditya
to hate each other...

941
02:06:05,039 --> 02:06:10,460
so that you will leave him forever

942
02:06:11,009 --> 02:06:16,854
What would she gain out of that?
- Aditya!

943
02:06:16,855 --> 02:06:19,066
Sanjana is devoted to her husband

944
02:06:19,067 --> 02:06:22,073
And a woman who is devoted to
her husband, acts as his shield

945
02:06:23,451 --> 02:06:27,082
Even God is afraid to meddle
with her husband's life

946
02:06:27,083 --> 02:06:31,090
But this is an evil spirit

947
02:06:31,091 --> 02:06:35,223
She was smart enough to
separate the two of you

948
02:06:35,224 --> 02:06:40,108
As for Aditya...
he's all alone now

949
02:06:40,109 --> 02:06:43,365
Are you telling us that Sanjana
must go back to Aditya?

950
02:06:44,034 --> 02:06:47,583
If not as his wife, as a human being
she must go back to Aditya

951
02:06:50,129 --> 02:06:53,134
Because she's the only one
who can save Aditya's life

952
02:06:53,135 --> 02:06:56,350
That woman will now try to take
Aditya away with her forever

953
02:06:57,937 --> 02:07:00,273
For that...

954
02:07:00,274 --> 02:07:04,156
she'll have to release Aditya
from his body

955
02:07:04,157 --> 02:07:09,453
She'll have to kill him

956
02:07:12,006 --> 02:07:14,135
I'm here to save your life

957
02:07:14,136 --> 02:07:17,851
Once I have seen you off
at your door...

958
02:07:17,852 --> 02:07:23,439
I don't want to see your face again

959
02:07:23,655 --> 02:07:29,618
Get the master's luggage.
We're leaving for Mumbai right now

960
02:08:02,357 --> 02:08:04,819
Where's the master?

961
02:08:04,820 --> 02:08:07,324
What are you staring at me for?
Where's the master?

962
02:08:07,325 --> 02:08:10,665
I don't understand, Madam

963
02:08:10,666 --> 02:08:13,253
The master left with you
in a car, just moments ago

964
02:08:13,254 --> 02:08:18,716
What nonsense are you talking?
I've walked in here right now

965
02:08:29,244 --> 02:08:33,961
This is how the beginning
of the end always is

966
02:08:33,962 --> 02:08:40,134
That power is now close in
on its victim

967
02:08:40,141 --> 02:08:44,274
She's not going to spare
anyone now... no one!

968
02:08:52,498 --> 02:08:57,710
Listen to me, Sanjana. Please

969
02:08:59,847 --> 02:09:04,975
Look at me, please

970
02:09:51,241 --> 02:09:56,376
Should I leave the world
and never return again...?

971
02:09:57,003 --> 02:10:02,096
What would you do, my love?

972
02:10:08,484 --> 02:10:13,620
I'd snatch you from God.
I'd make you belong to me

973
02:10:14,079 --> 02:10:19,214
Till as long as we live,
we shall never part

974
02:10:19,840 --> 02:10:24,224
May this pledge never break

975
02:10:25,519 --> 02:10:29,442
Even if it angers God

976
02:10:37,876 --> 02:10:39,796
The doctors are doing their best

977
02:10:39,797 --> 02:10:42,092
A couple of fractures in
the hip and his legs

978
02:10:42,093 --> 02:10:45,266
They say he'll be all right if he
regains consciousness in two hours

979
02:10:46,268 --> 02:10:48,564
Will he live, or won't he?

980
02:10:48,565 --> 02:10:51,402
Uncle's flying with
experts from Mumbai

981
02:10:51,403 --> 02:10:53,406
These people talk any nonsense

982
02:10:53,407 --> 02:10:55,911
They'll take over everything the
moment they arrive, you will see

983
02:10:55,912 --> 02:10:57,414
Will he live, or won't he?

984
02:10:57,415 --> 02:11:00,881
The car fell from a height of
just 50 feet. Straight down, too

985
02:11:02,050 --> 02:11:06,927
Will he survive, or won't he?

986
02:11:33,362 --> 02:11:36,367
There's just one way
of saving Aditya

987
02:11:36,368 --> 02:11:39,708
He's still breathing.
Before he stops breathing...

988
02:11:40,084 --> 02:11:43,381
let's burn Malini's body.
That could save him

989
02:11:43,382 --> 02:11:46,722
That's the only way that
wandering spirit can be dealt with

990
02:11:48,016 --> 02:11:50,019
After burning in the pyre...

991
02:11:50,020 --> 02:11:53,443
whether she wants it or not,
she has to accept a release

992
02:11:53,444 --> 02:11:57,368
Let's go and find her body
before she takes Aditya and...

993
02:11:58,036 --> 02:12:01,459
She won't be able to do
any harm to my Aditya

994
02:12:01,460 --> 02:12:05,133
Once, she snatched him from me

995
02:12:05,134 --> 02:12:09,391
I won't let her do it again

996
02:12:09,392 --> 02:12:12,063
No matter what she does...

997
02:12:12,064 --> 02:12:15,279
I will snatch my husband
from the jaws of death

998
02:12:43,418 --> 02:12:46,926
Should this lemon turn red
where we place it...

999
02:12:47,761 --> 02:12:51,769
it'll means she's right there.
That's where we must look for her

1000
02:12:52,521 --> 02:12:55,483
This is the place

1001
02:12:55,484 --> 02:13:00,863
She should be somewhere here

1002
02:15:04,117 --> 02:15:10,080
I think we must burn this body
right here

1003
02:17:56,044 --> 02:17:59,842
You're the faithful bitch, aren't you?

1004
02:17:59,843 --> 02:18:02,932
Despite knowing that Aditya
belongs to me...

1005
02:18:02,933 --> 02:18:06,355
you keep following him
with your tongue hanging out...

1006
02:18:06,356 --> 02:18:08,610
and even get here?

1007
02:18:08,611 --> 02:18:11,616
Shameless creature! Whore!

1008
02:18:11,617 --> 02:18:15,289
He has slept in my arms!

1009
02:18:15,290 --> 02:18:19,550
Before you can burn my corpse and
try to distance him from me...

1010
02:18:20,300 --> 02:18:25,721
I'll turn you into a corpse!

1011
02:24:57,929 --> 02:24:59,890
Congratulations, Mr Dhanraj

1012
02:24:59,891 --> 02:25:05,395
There's no danger
to your son's life

1013
02:25:38,844 --> 02:25:45,022
Sanjana, I was wrong...
absolutely wrong!

1014
02:25:45,023 --> 02:25:48,028
My friend has made it

1015
02:25:48,029 --> 02:25:53,116
Your Aditya has made it

1016
02:26:02,015 --> 02:26:05,690
There's just one reason why
Aditya is alive. It's Sanjana

1017
02:26:07,067 --> 02:26:11,952
Sanjana has proved that if a woman
is bent on saving her husband's life...

1018
02:26:12,537 --> 02:26:16,002
it can change the minds
of both... God and Satan

1019
02:26:52,825 --> 02:26:57,794
Every pain we will bear together

1020
02:26:58,294 --> 02:27:01,968
Let's resolve to do that

1021
02:27:03,514 --> 02:27:08,691
We shall never break...

1022
02:27:09,233 --> 02:27:13,116
let's promise each other

1023
02:27:14,034 --> 02:27:19,921
I'm afraid of the very idea
of going to seed

1024
02:27:35,326 --> 02:27:40,210
Yours is a lovable face...

1025
02:27:40,211 --> 02:27:44,053
I could die for it

1026
02:27:46,098 --> 02:27:49,145
You do not know...

1027
02:27:49,146 --> 02:27:52,612
how much I love you

1028
02:28:14,154 --> 02:28:16,826
To fall in love is easy

1029
02:28:16,827 --> 02:28:21,000
To live up to it
is very difficult

1030
02:28:21,001 --> 02:28:23,923
Only after I had passed
this test of love...

1031
02:28:23,924 --> 02:28:27,848
did my married life really blossom

1032
02:28:27,849 --> 02:28:30,102
Only after travelling through
the depths of death...

1033
02:28:30,103 --> 02:28:32,106
could I reach the zenith of life

1034
02:28:32,107 --> 02:28:36,031
The zenith where I was blessed
with the nectar of love

1035
02:28:37,075 --> 02:28:42,537
Forever.
