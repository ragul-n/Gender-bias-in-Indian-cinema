You know how?

RADIO: - I'll tell you...

26
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:57,540

much traffic the other day.

27
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:02,290
I was wondering...how about
I start a taxi business?

28
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:05,200
RADIO: "What are you saying..."

29
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:07,120

30

- It's...it's a nice idea.
- Isn't it?

31
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:12,540
Really nice.

32
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:14,250
Non-AC, right?

33
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:17,410
AC of course, it's hot outside.

34
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:20,160
AC... of course.

35
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,080
And, you're going to drive too.

36
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:27,580
Well, sometimes I'll
sit at the back...

37
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:29,080
...to check on the drivers.

38
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:32,830
Mom, will you drop me
to school...in your AC taxi?

39
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,700
Turn down the volume first.

40
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,000
It's a fantastic idea, Sulu.

41
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,200
We'll buy three taxis...

42
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:41,660
In fact, why three!
We'll buy five taxis!

43
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,040
Sulochana Travels Pvt. Ltd.

44
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:47,160

45
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:49,750
Mom...Aunty twins.

46
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,080
Yes sis.
No sis.

47
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:53,160
Hello.

48
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:57,870
Yeah, sister. Have you'll arrived?
We're almost there.

49
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,790
Tell the watchman to give
daddy a chair to sit on.

50
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:03,660
Yeah, okay.

51
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,700
I'm never giving you the phone again.

52
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:09,410
Turn on the AC...we don't
take the car out every day.

53
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:11,370
- Don't, it spoils the pick-up of the car!
- Miser...

54
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:18,450

Wow...again.

58
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:25,830
Look at the tan on her face
because of the hours under the sun.

59
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:28,120
You won't believe how
much fun we had today.

60
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:30,750
It was a close race, a woman
tried to sneak in front of me...

61
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:31,790
Okay, okay, champion.

62
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:33,580
Dad's been waiting for a while,
he must be tired.

63
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:34,750
- Right, sis.
- Yes, sis.

64
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:36,870
- Go sit, I'll bring tea.
- Come on.

65
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:39,750
- Right, sis.
- Yes, sis.

66
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:41,040
Hey Subodh?

67
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:43,250
Do you know my name?

68
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:46,500
Ashok, didn't you
get the TV fixed yet?

69
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:49,620
Grandpa, no one listens to dad.

70
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:51,870
Pranav, you talk too much.

71
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:54,160
Wash your hands, everyone.

72
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:56,370
Dad, let's not bring up the TV issue

73
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,540
It's a never-ending fight.

74
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:58,500
What fight?

75
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:00,200
I am going to the consumer
court to seek a replacement.

76
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:01,120
Just watch.

77
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:03,080
Hmm...consumer court.

78
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:04,250
Have a cup of tea before you go, ok?

79
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:05,450
Please sit...

80
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:10,500
Dad, just see what our Olympic
champion has won this time!

81
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,620
Just like when she was in school.

82
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,160
- Right, sis.
- Yes, sis.

83
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:16,080
- Hey champion, mimic someone.
- No, sis...

84
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,330
- Hema Malini.
- Yes, yes.

85
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:20,830
No, Sita-Gita.

86
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,870
- Sridevi.
- Yes, Sridevi.

87
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:26,950
Sweetheart.

88
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:30,120
Pranav stop making
that irritating noise

89
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:32,160
You'll get a whack now.

90
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:33,950
Aunty twins.

91
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:36,200
- You know what?
- What?

92
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:37,450
- Should I tell them, mom?
- What?

93
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:38,700
- Tell me.
- Quiet. Quiet.

94
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:43,200
Mom's going to drive a taxi.
Not one, not two, but five!

95
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:44,950
Sulochana Travels... Hello.

96
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,950
Sulu, what's this all about?

97
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,500
He's just blabbering.

98
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:52,540
By the way, do the banks
give a loan for buying taxis?

99
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:56,080
- Five taxis?
- No, just one for now.

100
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:57,540
Yeah.

101
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:00,410
So...you want to drive a taxi now.

102
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,000
No, sister, it's business.

103
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:04,910
What taxi?

104
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:08,410
I told you many a times to learn
something from your sisters.

105
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:09,410
But no.

106
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:11,200
Join a bank.

107
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:12,290
No.

108
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:16,120
You flunked thrice
in Higher secondary!

109
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,000
You guys aren't helping yourself
at all. Please have something.

110
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:22,790
Pranav, are you like
your mother in studies?

111
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:24,370
If you get eggs on your report card...

112
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:27,750
...then you'll sell
eggs when you grow up!

113
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:31,870
If you get eggs on your report card
then you'll sell eggs when you grow up!

114
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:34,950
Cup...

115
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:37,540
I haven't finished...

116
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:40,290
Hey Champion,
what did dad say wrong?

117
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:42,200
Of course not, it's entirely my fault.

118
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:43,580
I just said it for the heck of it.

119
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:44,910
I don't want to do anything.

120
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,450
We all know you want to do something.

121
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:50,000
Honestly, I don't want to do anything.

122
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:51,410
I am done...

123
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,080
- You guys are doing it, right.
- Yeah...

124
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,160
Bank job, loan, your own home...

125
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:56,500
- There she goes again.
- No, listen to me.

126
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:58,080
Go on, go on, we're listening.

127
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,080
Daddy has a problem with me, right?

128
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:02,830
Why does he have to keep repeating
that I failed the higher secondary?

129
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,080
And that too in front of Pranav!

130
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:06,370
What else is he going to say?
That you passed with a distinction?

131
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,040
- The first year I was down
with pneumonia. - Yeah.

132
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,580
The second year, there were
questions outside of the syllabus.

133
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:13,790
You know even Gunjan Dubey,
the class topper failed that exam.

134
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:17,000
- And, in the third year... - You found
Ashok outside the tuition class.

135
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:18,870
- So?
- So...

136
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,000
So what?

137
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:22,870
- So what?
- Stop repeating yourselves.

138
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,790
- So nothing.
- What do you mean by nothing?

139
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:27,540
- You lost our Rs. 30,000 in the chit-fund.
- Forget it, sis...

140
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,160
I will pay you guys back.

141
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:31,250
I am not asking you to pay now.

142
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,120
But you keep reminding me.

143
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:35,660
Dad's lecturing me out there and
the two of you are lecturing me here.

144
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:38,500
- Did you guys get my bio-data?
- We'll get it next time.

145
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:40,370
It has a four-page
long list of hobbies!

146
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:42,450
Why can't you stick to one thing?
You know what...

147
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:44,500
...you should attempt your higher
secondary exams along with Pranav.

148
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:46,870
- You'll definitely pass this time.
- Forget it, sister. Let it be.

149
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:48,750
What's going on?

150
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:52,910
Making eggs.

151
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:54,830
- There she goes again.
- Eggs?

152
00:08:57,410 --> 00:08:58,540
Next month is your birthday.
Keep this.

153
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:00,580
There are great
properties in Borivali.

154
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:01,660
Why don't you get a flat there?

155
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,750
- There's no need for this.
- Keep it, son.

156
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:05,250
And, keep your temper down.

157
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:07,950
Pranav, concentrate on your studies...
or we'll come for you someday.

158
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,080
Don't forget the house warming.
Be there on time.

159
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,580
- Bye.
- Bye.

160
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,750
- Dad, you should get a car like that.
- Shut up!

161
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:20,830
Ashok, please press my feet.
I am really tired.

162
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,330
Sulu...am I losing hair?

163
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,830
What was daddy saying?

164
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:39,040
Same old property...home...why
buy a house so far away?

165
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,500
Same old conversation.

166
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:42,040
And, what did you say?

167
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:45,700
I clearly said that I'll
take the farmhouse in Alibaug.

168
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:49,540
Later, we were arguing over the
steel factory. But I said, hey dad...

169
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:57,450
They are right.
Well settled.

170
00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:01,370
- And you got stuck with me.
- So true.

171
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,450
Poor Sulu.

172
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,750
Poor Sulu, huh!

173
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:09,870
Come here.

174
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:17,830
Sing a song?

175
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,040
SP Balasubramaniam?

176
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:30,290
"Batata Vada..."

177
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,950
"Batata Vada..."

178
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:40,500
"I didn't want to give my heart..."

179
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:44,750
"...but I had to."

180
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,330
"Batata Vada..."

181
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:51,950
"Batata Vada..."

182
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:58,250
Pranav.
Pranav.

183
00:10:58,620 --> 00:10:59,450
Get up.

184
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,250
Sweet...heart.

185
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:07,040
You didn't finish your food.
Finish it.

186
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,790
Give me the mobile.
You're always playing with the phone.

187
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:10,450
Come on.

188
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:12,290
If you come back and say
you ate from Chetan's lunchbox...

189
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:13,410
...then I'll whack you.

190
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:14,790
- Ashok.
- Yeah.

191
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:18,790
- Bye.
- Fix your hair, Pranav.

192
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:19,790
Slow down.

193
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:25,040
It's going to be such a long day,
I've got to meet Shanu too.

194
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:25,950
Hi.

195
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:28,660
Hello.

196
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:31,450
Tea?

197
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:33,200
- Tea?
- Some other time Sulu.

198
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:35,790
Very tired today.

199
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:37,580
At what time is your flight tomorrow?

200
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:40,580
It's at 8 o'clock in the morning,
I can finally sleep a little.

201
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:50,290
Hi...

202
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:19,830
You do it now.

203
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:26,450
Mind it Bhagyashree,
if you dirty my clothes today...

204
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:32,080
Why you... I won't spare you today.
Who do you think you are?

205
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,790
- Who do you think you are?
- Who do you think you are?

206
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:36,910
You broke my needle.

207
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,830
I won't spare you this time.

208
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:41,830
We may be sworn enemies,
but not while we're at work.

209
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:45,370
- You...
- You bloody rascal...

210
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:48,370
Omar...
Omar...

211
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:54,160
You've got diabetes,
you'll die if you fight like this

212
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:57,160
- It's your funeral today.
- Don't...don't hit him.

213
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:59,040
What are you two doing?

214
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,080
Let go.

215
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:01,750
Hello.

216
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:03,500
Don't interfere, sir.

217
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:06,450
I'll show you today.

218
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:08,620
I...I will...

219
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:11,620
Mathuradas and brothers...

220
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:15,500
I am quitting.
Let's shut this place down...

221
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:16,950
...because there's just
no point of all this.

222
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,660
As you can see,
there's complete chaos outside.

223
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:21,540
I've been dealing
with this for 12 years

224
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:22,700
But not anymore.

225
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:27,450
You know what? I deserve
a commendation on Republic Day!

226
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:31,410
Listen...praying won't help...

227
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:33,540
...we've got to do something.

228
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:40,700
It cannot continue like this.

229
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:45,120
Last month someone
lost a tooth in the fight.

230
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:48,910
I've been carrying that tooth in my pocket
but no one's come up to claim it.

231
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,370
Tell me...

232
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,080
I mean someone's...

233
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,200
Who is he?

234
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:54,870
Is he new around here?

235
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,330
Apprentice?

236
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:58,870
I hope you know how to fight.

237
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,500
And you know...

238
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,080
"Under the shade of old banyan tree."

239
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:09,250
"The sound of birds
along the mighty sea."

240
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:11,120
"I wrote a letter,

241
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:13,830
"I mailed it to all my friends."

242
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,080
"And sure enough,
I know the post delivered it today."

243
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,120
"I came home and asked."

244
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:23,580
"I couldn't wait for the reply."

245
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:26,700
- Repeat once again?
- Yes, sir.

246
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,830
"On a cold blue morning,

247
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:31,830
under the shade of
an old Banyan tree."

248
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:35,580
"The sound of birds
along the mighty sea."

249
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,700
"I wrote a letter,

250
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:39,910
I mailed it to all my friends."

251
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:44,580
"And sure enough, I know
the postman delivered it today."

252
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:46,620
"What my friends have thought."

253
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:50,160
- Repeat?
- Yes, sir.

254
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,700
"On a cold blue morning..."

255
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:55,910
- Laljibhai.
- Huh...

256
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:58,120
You should start
making home deliveries.

257
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:01,000
Well, my delivery boy isn't free.

258
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:03,790
- Yeah...I can clearly see how busy he is.
- Yeah...

259
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:09,790
You see...if I make him run up and
down for small household products...

260
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:11,870
...then he'll quit the next day.

261
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,120
My advice is to take this broom.

262
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:16,370
And, in case you want your
stuff delivered to your home...

263
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:19,000
...then you must make
purchases of at least Rs.500

264
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,450
Then he'll deliver.

265
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,660
Excuse me, I must take this.

266
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,080
Hello.

267
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,330
Yes, madam.

268
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,540
Yeah, the boy's free.

269
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,450
I'll send him right away.

270
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:34,500
Change, please?

271
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:35,370
Hello.

272
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,540
No-no-no...

273
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:40,080
I dialed one...
I dialed one for Hindi...

274
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:42,540
...why are you speaking in English?

275
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,870
But, you should be on extn. 2, right?

276
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:48,200
Wasn't hungry.

277
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:51,790
My name?
My name is Ashok Dubey.

278
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:53,160
Date of Birth?

279
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:55,830
What for?
So you can wish me on my birthday?

280
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:57,660
Hello...

281
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:59,910
Stop wasting my time.

282
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,950
Let me talk to the guy
who always attends my calls.

283
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,620
- What's his name?
- Deepak!

284
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:12,660
Concentrate.

285
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,120
Give me his number.

286
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:17,040
What do you mean you can't?

287
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,450
What do you think I will do with him?

288
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:25,040
Fine, I am going to
the consumer court.

289
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:26,660
What do you mean by saying no to me?

290
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:28,120
I bought that TV for Rs.20,000

291
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:30,160
It's been 7 months and 3 days.

292
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:33,580
I don't want a mechanic,
I want a replacement.

293
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,370
Call your boss.

294
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,950
I'll see you...

295
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,660
I'll see you in court.

296
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:45,040
Hello... Hello...

297
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:46,910
They hung up.

298
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:51,290
I scared them.

299
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:53,370
These guys are really
scared of you, eh!

300
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,160
You think this is funny.

301
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:57,290
- I've been...
- I didn't say that.

302
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,500
Pranav, concentrate on your studies.

303
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:00,660
What did I do?

304
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:02,870
Stop yelling at the poor
boy when you're mad at me.

305
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,950
Stop yelling at me when
you're mad at the TV guy.

306
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,040
No point in locking horns with you.

307
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,250
It's been a while
since we locked anything.

308
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:26,910
Sulu.

309
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:30,700
- Really?
- What?

310
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:35,200
What you just said out there.

311
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:37,620
What?

312
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:41,660
You know... locked horns...

313
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:46,870
Sleep.

314
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,700
Sulu...how does Dr.
Batra know I am losing hair?

315
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:56,660
I keep getting these texts from him.

316
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:17,620
Hello.

317
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,750
Hello, am I speaking to Sulochana?

318
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:21,700
- Yes.
- I am speaking from Radio Wow.

319
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:24,750
Did you take part in the Prestige
'Sawaal Batao Seeti Bajao' contest?

320
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:27,500
- Yes.
- Madam, you've won the contest...

321
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:30,250
...and you'll be
speaking to RJ Albeli Anjali next.

322
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:31,950
- Now?
- Yes, when else?

323
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:36,450
Alright then,
welcome to Radio Wow, it's Wow...

324
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:37,950
...and this is Albeli...

325
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:40,870
Albeli Anjali,
and with me is our first caller...

326
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:43,120
Who is Mrs. Sulochana!

327
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:45,080
Congratulations, Sulochana.
Applause, applause.

328
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,660
Because you just
won a pressure cooker.

329
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:49,830
- So say what?
- It's Wow!

330
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:53,700
Albeli, I really love your voice.

331
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:55,410
Thank you...thank you, Sulochona.

332
00:18:55,500 --> 00:19:00,040
But tell me, Sulochana...what do
you do, where do you live, right now.

333
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:03,790
- My name is Sulochana.
- Err...which we know.

334
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:05,700
I am a housewife.

335
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:08,200
I live in Virar,
and right now I was sleeping.

336
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:09,830
Sleeping, now?

337
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:13,620
Yes...

338
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:17,370
You see,
I wake up at 5:30 am every day.

339
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:18,910
I just dozed off.

340
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,330
You know what,
Sulochana, can I call you Sulu?

341
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:24,750
Yes...you can.

342
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:29,200
Even Ashok...I mean, my husband,
even he calls me Sulu.

343
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:31,160
You're so sweet, Sulu.

344
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:33,250
Can you whistle?

345
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:35,000
Well, I'm not a pressure cooker

346
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:36,200
That's true...

347
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:38,700
- But I can sing.
- Then sing.

348
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:41,450
Singer Sulu, let Mumbai hear you sing.

349
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:42,540
Okay.

350
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:46,450
"Your voice is sweet like magpie."

351
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:52,370
"Such an innocent face."

352
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:56,500
- Wow...wow...wow
- I haven't finished yet.

353
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:59,290
- Okay, okay.
- "Kohl laden eyes."

354
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:01,700
"Fiery lips."

355
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:06,410
"I'm losing my heart."

356
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:10,250
- Wow...wow...wow, Sulu, brilliant.
- Thank you.

357
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,700
Now I want to know how you feel...

358
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:16,200
...on winning this brand new
clip-on prestige pressure cooker.

359
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:19,830
Actually Albeli,
I don't want a pressure cooker.

360
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:20,870
What?

361
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:22,950
Hello. Can I get a TV instead?

362
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:27,950
Uh Oh...I think Sulu
Just got disconnected

363
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,200
Albeli...

364
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:31,830
Albeli?

365
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,080
Hello.

366
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,620
Hello... Hello...

367
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:41,700
I cannot give Sulu a TV

368
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:44,500
...but she will definitely
get that pressure cooker...

369
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:46,370
...and also this next
song is dedicated to her.

370
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:50,870
Hello.

371
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:54,000
- Madam, what did you just say?
- I still want that cooker.

372
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,540
But you just said you don't want it.

373
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:58,370
- What size is it?
- I don't know what size, madam.

374
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:01,200
By the way,
do you have a contest for TV?

375
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,580
Madam, we aren't running
a contest for a TV these days...

376
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:06,580
...if you still want that pressure
cooker, come down at 11 Am tomorrow.

377
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:09,410
Where? Where?
I'll write it down.

378
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,750
Wait a second.

379
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:23,700
One emergency light, crockery,
one flask and now a pressure cooker.

380
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:25,450
Yours truly won it single handedly

381
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:26,540
Bravo!

382
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,620
Do you have any idea
how much money I saved you?

383
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:31,370
I am going to Radio Wow tomorrow.

384
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:35,660
But, we have a radio.

385
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:38,660
Sulu.

386
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,160
You know I am really fed up.

387
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,200
I was wondering...why don't
we start something ourselves.

388
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:48,000
You and me... 50-50.

389
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:49,160
Business.

390
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:51,700
No!

391
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:54,370
Partnerships are just not my thing.

392
00:21:57,410 --> 00:21:58,660
Fine. Great.

393
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,750
Good Morning,
you're listening to Radio Wow.

394
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:10,370
So say what...it's Wow!

395
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:13,120
Today could be your day.
So get out.

396
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:16,040
Let your dreams bake
under the sun's rays.

397
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,870
- Let your smile make your day.
- Pranav, wake up!

398
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:21,370
It's your day, and it's your day.

399
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:28,200
"Up and away, spins and sways...
like a restless wheel."

400
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:31,000
"She's on fire."

401
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,080
- Mummy
- Coming!

402
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,500
"Oh oh she sizzles,
oh oh she sizzles..."

403
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:35,790
"Left... Right..."

404
00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:36,910
Sulu, pass the towel.

405
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:40,080
"Left... Right... Left... "

406
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,700
"Left turn."

407
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:44,250
Come on, come on!

408
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:45,080
Bye.

409
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:46,750
"Oh oh she sizzles..."

410
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:09,290
"She sizzles and shines...
She's too hot to handle."

411
00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:12,620
"Like a big surprise
that comes in small packing.

412
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:22,540
"Oh oh she sizzles,
oh oh she frizzles"

413
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:25,700
"She's a tough lady."

414
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:29,080
"Oh oh like a bazooka,
that packs quite a punch."

415
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:32,580
"She's brave, there she goes with
her handbag clung on her shoulder.

416
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:39,450
"Up and away, spins and sways...
like a restless wheel."

417
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:42,450
"She's on fire."

418
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:46,000
"Oh oh she sizzles..."

419
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:52,660
"High on heroism,
with an attitude of a superstar."

420
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:55,700
"She's a dude, still at heart."

421
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:59,000
"Oh oh she sizzles..."

422
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:05,830
"She's like the breeze,
turns wherever she likes."

423
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:08,910
"Whenever people meet her,
they say..."

424
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,120
"Oh oh she sizzles..."

425
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:15,410
"Oh oh she sizzles,
oh oh she frizzles"

426
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:18,750
"She's a tough lady."

427
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:21,910
"Oh oh like a bazooka,
that packs quite a punch."

428
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:25,410
"She amazes you."

429
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:28,660
"Oh oh she sizzles,
oh oh she frizzles"

430
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:32,000
"She's a tough lady."

431
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:35,370
"Oh oh like a bazooka,
that packs quite a punch."

432
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:39,500
"She's brave, there she goes with
her handbag clung on her shoulder.

433
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:45,700
"Oh oh she sizzles..."

434
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:51,830
Does this elevator
go to the Radio Wow office?

435
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:58,000
Madam, the security's calling you.

436
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:01,040
- Me?
- She's coming. Yeah...

437
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:07,450
- Did you call me?
- No, madam, I didn't.

438
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,620
Hi Girija,
please look into the 'Curry' issue...

439
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:25,450
...with the Lunch service
guy on an urgent basis.

440
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:27,910
- Now what should I reply to this?
- That's all you'll get on a tight budget.

441
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,950
That doesn't mean you'll
serve us substandard food.

442
00:25:31,290 --> 00:25:33,160
Hello ma'am, how may I help you?

443
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:35,120
My name is Sulochana...

444
00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:37,700
..."Sawal Batao,
Seeti Bajao" contest winner.

445
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:41,040
Yes. Fill out this form.

446
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:43,540
Vishnu, give madam
her pressure cooker.

447
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:48,040
- You may fill it there.
- Okay.

448
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,080
I've studied in a convent school...

449
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,250
...is it appropriate for a Convent-educated
girl to be arguing over 'Curry'?

450
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:53,330
Just give me my cheque, madam.

451
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:54,620
I've got the conjunctivirus!

452
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:57,750
But what do I write here?
Give me my Cheque, madam.

453
00:25:57,910 --> 00:26:00,700
I am fed up of dealing
with this issue every day.

454
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:02,000
I'm gonna leave a note behind...

455
00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:04,750
...saying you and your 'Curry'
are responsible for my death.

456
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:08,830
Give me my cheque.

457
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:09,700
Yes ma'am.

458
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:12,250
Excuse me,
madam...I would like to take part...

459
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:16,370
...in the 'You can be an RJ' contest.

460
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:20,000
Ma'am, that's not a contest,
it's an interview.

461
00:26:20,290 --> 00:26:22,870
So...have you ever done it before?

462
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:25,120
No, but I can.

463
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:29,330
- Give me a form.
- There are no forms.

464
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:32,950
You know what,
go home and record your voice...

465
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:35,750
...and send it on email.
I'll forward it ahead.

466
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:36,950
Hello, yes?

467
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:39,290
Please hold on the line.

468
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:42,330
You see, ma'am.
My phone's really old...

469
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:44,540
- ...and it doesn't record properly.
- I see.

470
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:46,910
So, why don't you record
my voice right now?

471
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:49,410
You know what,
I'll give you a call tomorrow.

472
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:50,620
I have your number.

473
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:53,250
But I cannot come back tomorrow.
I am busy.

474
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:56,200
I would've done it...
I mean, woman to woman...

475
00:26:56,370 --> 00:26:57,410
If I could.

476
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:59,830
- My cheque, madam.
- Hold on for a second.

477
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,700
- Ma'am...
- Why don't you call someone inside?

478
00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:03,370
Tell them I am the contest winner.

479
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:04,830
Please.

480
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:13,200
Hello, ma'am.
The winner would like to talk to you.

481
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:14,870
Okay.

482
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:17,750
She's asked you to come back tomorrow.

483
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:18,580
She's busy...

484
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:21,040
- And you...
- You didn't ask properly.

485
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:23,750
What do you mean?
I just called up in front of you.

486
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:25,500
- Give me my cheque.
- You didn't tell them my name...

487
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:27,290
Hey Girija, what's going on?

488
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,000
- What's going on?
- Hello, ma'am.

489
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,620
She's been bothering me.

490
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:32,370
- She wants to give an audition.
- Bothering you?

491
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:34,250
I said it's not possible,
everyone's busy right now.

492
00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:36,330
Yes, she's been...

493
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:39,580
- Let me speak.
- I've been telling her...

494
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:41,410
- Let me speak.
- Fine.

495
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:46,080
I've been telling her that
I want to take part in the RJ contest.

496
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,250
All I asked her for
is the application form.

497
00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:50,000
But I told you...

498
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,120
But she said to me...

499
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:53,540
Girija.

500
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:57,330
Madam, what's your name?

501
00:27:58,450 --> 00:27:59,660
My name is Sulochana.

502
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:02,500
"Sawal Batao,
Seeti Bajao" contest winner.

503
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:04,250
Sulu?

504
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:06,080
You're Sulu, aren't you?

505
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:09,620
- You know me?
- What a question.

506
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:12,000
"Voice sweet like magpie."

507
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:14,450
Yes, I sang that song.

508
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:18,870
And, I am Albeli.

509
00:28:19,290 --> 00:28:20,540
Albeli Anjali?

510
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:24,330
We spoke yesterday.

511
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:27,250
Do you want to be an RJ?

512
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:32,040
I can try...just give me a chance.

513
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:37,120
"Eyes laden with kohl.
Fiery lips."

514
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:38,700
Who is this character?

515
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:42,000
"I am losing my heart."

516
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:45,660
"Wow wow Sulu, brilliant."

517
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:46,410
Okay.

518
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:49,080
Girija, is Maria in her cabin?

519
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:57,250
Sulu...that's our radio booth...

520
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:59,580
...where we host our show.

521
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:03,410
- Looking nice.
- Shut up.

522
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:05,120
Where were you?

523
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:07,000
Is this the time to show up?

524
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:09,540
I was attending a
protest held by poets.

525
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:10,750
And what happened to your head?

526
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:11,750
"This wound..."

527
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,790
"This wound which runs deep..."

528
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:15,910
"It's not just a wound,
but my witness..."

529
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:20,660
"It's the time between dawn and dusk."

530
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:23,830
Loser...it's nothing.

531
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:25,750
It's an internal wound, madam.

532
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:29,410
- Should I...
- No, no, it's fine. Please come in.

533
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:31,750
Come.

534
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,910
Maria...Sulochana.

535
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,200
Sulu.

536
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:37,540
"Sawal Batao,
Seeti Bajao" contest winner.

537
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:38,290
Pressure cooker.

538
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:39,830
"Voice sweet like magpie."

539
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,790
Hi...
I am Maria.

540
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
- I head Radio Wow.
- Hi.

541
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:49,830
- Champion.
- Sorry.

542
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,040
Champion.

543
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:55,450
Sorry, we couldn't give you a TV

544
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:58,910
...but, you'll have to settle
for the pressure cooker this time.

545
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:02,330
Actually, two weeks ago...

546
00:30:02,450 --> 00:30:06,580
...I had a heated argument
and bought the same pressure cooker.

547
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:08,580
You know how husbands are.

548
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,370
I know...I mean I understand.

549
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:13,000
But, you can invite
us to lunch someday...

550
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,580
No, this is a gift.

551
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,200
- I've twin sisters.
- Okay.

552
00:30:17,330 --> 00:30:18,450
Aradhna-Kalpana.

553
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:19,750
And I am Sulochana.

554
00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:22,580
So, there's a house-warming
at sister Kalpana's home.

555
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:24,160
I imagined this will
be the best gift for her.

556
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:25,410
Okay...

557
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:28,750
Well, that's great.

558
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:30,120
It was really nice meeting you.

559
00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:33,120
Keep listening to our radio station.
Say What...

560
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:34,290
It's Wow.

561
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:36,620
- Fast learner.
- Come on.

562
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:41,200
Maria madam,
I saw the RJ contest poster outside.

563
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:43,290
I want to take part too.

564
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:45,080
Do you want to be an RJ?

565
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,450
Do you have any prior experience?

566
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:49,370
No, but I know I can.

567
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:51,620
Back in our old society...

568
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:54,500
...I would speak over the
mic at every given opportunity.

569
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:01,910
- Let me introduce you...
- I know him.

570
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,040
Do you?

571
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,040
Of course, he's quite popular.

572
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:11,830
- Our RJ, producer, poet, revolutionary.
- Protestor.

573
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:13,750
Protestor. Protestor.

574
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:15,000
Tell her your full name.

576
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:23,080
So Mr. Baghi will take your audition.

577
00:31:23,290 --> 00:31:25,790

00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:03,290
- Very badly organized.
- Okay.

591
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:04,620
There was a huge queue.

592
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:07,580
But us ladies started
playing 'Antakshari' outside.

593
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:09,330
And, I won that too.

594
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:11,830
That's how we passed
time until 2 o'clock.

595
00:32:11,910 --> 00:32:13,450
Then, it was time
for Pranav to come home.

596
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:15,790
So, responsibility first.

597
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:17,500
Of course.

598
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,250

00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:33,330
Sorry.

Come on.

602
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:55,580
Good stuff.
Shall we start?

603
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:58,450
- What am I supposed to do?
- Stop.

604
00:32:59,870 --> 00:33:00,910
Don't yell.

605
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:05,290
Here's the paper,
those are your lines.

606
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,160
That's the mic,
you've to speak in this.

607
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:10,500
No yelling, speak softly.

608
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:18,040
Hello...

609
00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:20,160
"I'm here to light up your nights..."

610
00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:21,620
Hold on. Hold on.

611
00:33:21,910 --> 00:33:25,120
- Maria, may I?
- Yeah...he'll show you how to do it.

612
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:26,120
Okay.

613
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:34,950
Hello...

614
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:47,620
- What is this?
- Come on.

615
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:53,700
Why is she laughing?

616
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:55,250
Sulochana, listen.

617
00:33:57,750 --> 00:33:58,750
Hello...

618
00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:04,750
I'm here to light up your nights
and make your dreams come true.

619
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:07,700
Dial my number straight
from your heart...

620
00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:09,580
...and talk to me.

621
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:11,000
Won't you?

622
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,500
You mean like that Actress Helen?

623
00:34:14,870 --> 00:34:18,250
You see, I can mimic
Actress Hema Malini and Sridevi.

624
00:34:18,370 --> 00:34:20,370
Like... Sweetheart.

625
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:23,250
Okay, no... you don't have
to do anything like that.

626
00:34:23,370 --> 00:34:25,000
Your voice is really good.

627
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:27,700
So use your voice.

628
00:34:28,290 --> 00:34:29,540
Come on, Sulochana.

629
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:33,790
Hello...

630
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:42,910
Hello...

631
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:44,830
Nice.

632
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:48,330
I am at a recording at Inspire BKC.

633
00:34:48,450 --> 00:34:49,450
I'm busy for the next two hours.

634
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:51,500
Come back later, okay.

635
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:57,200
- TV mechanic, 7 months ago...
- Madam.

636
00:34:57,330 --> 00:34:59,500
Please do it if you want to, or don't.

637
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:01,620
Don't waste my time, I am a busy man.

638
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:04,830
- Sorry.
- Look Sulochana, like this.

639
00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:06,450
Hello...

640
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:07,750
Sexy.

641
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,750
Do you understand sexy?

642
00:35:10,290 --> 00:35:11,290
Come on.

643
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,200
Hello...

644
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:24,870
I'm here to light up your nights...

645
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:28,000
...and to...

646
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,290
You see this pen...

647
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:38,540
Yes.

648
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:40,620
It's mightier than the sword.

649
00:35:42,370 --> 00:35:47,830
Such beautiful words should pour
out like pearls from a necklace.

650
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:54,700
We're not selling
knick-knacks on the train.

651
00:35:55,870 --> 00:35:57,330
- Maria?
- Relax.

652
00:35:58,370 --> 00:36:00,450
Anyway, it was really
nice meeting you.

653
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:04,160
- And, you have a very sexy voice.
- I know.

654
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:11,080
This is my card...

655
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:13,250
Call me.

656
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:21,160
Hello...

657
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:25,790
Hello...

658
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:29,790
I'm here to make
your nights colorful...

659
00:36:34,330 --> 00:36:37,790
Sulu, did you get a sore throat?

660
00:36:40,410 --> 00:36:42,160
No, just relaxing my throat.

661
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:44,540
What's wrong?

662
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:45,750
Come here...

663
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:48,870
Let me see.

664
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,750
Open wide.

665
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:53,950
Isn't it sexy?

666
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:57,080
What?

667
00:36:57,410 --> 00:37:00,410
- Forget it.
- No... who said that?

668
00:37:01,370 --> 00:37:04,000
My throat's strained.

669
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,910
I spoke on the mic for so long.

670
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,370
I am going to be an RJ.

671
00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:09,910
What's this now?

672
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:11,540
Radio.

673
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:14,450
Like the RJs that speak on radio.

674
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:16,750
Huh...

675
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:21,580
What if they ask for your
higher secondary certificate?

676
00:37:22,370 --> 00:37:23,950
What about all your taxis
parked downstairs?

677
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,040
Who is going to look after them?

678
00:37:25,290 --> 00:37:27,750
Remember that Sai Pav
Bhaji near your office.

679
00:37:27,830 --> 00:37:31,830
You were right,
their Pav Bhaji is really sexy.

680
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:41,700
Sulu...who's calling you sexy.

681
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:43,660
Who's calling you sexy?

682
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:51,250
"Subhash Saris and beyond."

683
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:55,330
You're listening to Radio Wow.
So say what...it's Wow!

684
00:37:55,790 --> 00:37:57,200
Do you want to be an RJ too?

685
00:37:57,450 --> 00:37:58,620
Do you have what it takes?

686
00:37:58,750 --> 00:37:59,870
So don't think twice.

687
00:37:59,950 --> 00:38:01,910
Pick up that phone and say...

688
00:38:04,370 --> 00:38:05,330
Hello.

689
00:38:05,870 --> 00:38:08,250
Hello...Lalji.

690
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:09,330
Huh.

691
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,450
- Boss.
- Huh.

692
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:14,700
Who is it now?

693
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:17,580
Who is it?

694
00:38:18,290 --> 00:38:19,250
Hello.

695
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,620
Hello...Lalji.

696
00:38:24,830 --> 00:38:26,040
Yeah...

697
00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:32,330
I am speaking from C-507, Jal Padma.

698
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:34,700
Yes.

699
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:39,500
I need a broom, please.

700
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:43,290
Of course.

701
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:46,080
I am waiting.

702
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:49,790
You'll bring it won't you?

703
00:38:50,410 --> 00:38:51,580
Yes.

704
00:38:56,290 --> 00:38:59,700
- Hey...get a broom.
- Should I go?

705
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:01,700
Just go get the broom.

706
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:16,830
Wow, what a surprise Lalji Bhai,
How come?

707
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:18,830
Why don't you mind your own business?

708
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:19,910
Broom and all.

709
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:33,120
There isn't a 5th floor
in this building.

710
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:36,000
I have asthama!
I could've died!

711
00:39:43,330 --> 00:39:45,700
- Broom.
- No, I already have one.

712
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:47,450
Water?

713
00:39:51,410 --> 00:39:53,660
This one...do this one.

714
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:56,080
Sir, I have a fever.
I want to go home.

715
00:39:56,910 --> 00:39:58,620
Just a minute.

716
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:01,540
- Yeah, Sulu.
- Hello.

717
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:03,950
Sulu...

718
00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:07,950
What's wrong?

719
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,450
Have you got a stomach ache?

720
00:40:12,370 --> 00:40:13,160
Maybe.

721
00:40:13,290 --> 00:40:16,370
I've got a fever, not indigestion.

722
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:21,620
Why don't you take
enteroquinol or rantac D?

723
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:22,830
It's next to the TV set.

724
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:28,250
Enteroquinol... and Rantac D.

725
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:34,700
If you're not feeling well,
go meet Dr. Savita.

726
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,750
But...I need Dr. Ashok.

727
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:42,580
I've got high fever sir

728
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:44,250
May I go home?

729
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:47,750
I guess you've lost your mind.

730
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:49,580
Why?

731
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:52,250
Are you scared, Dr. Ashok?

732
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:55,450
That's enough, Sulu.

733
00:40:55,580 --> 00:41:00,790
By the way, you were looking
really cute this morning.

734
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:09,700
Sir, they are calling you.

735
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Sulu, I must go now.

736
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:19,580
Will I see you soon?

737
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,450
Tell me, Dr. Ashok.

738
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:40,410
And that's a six.
Yes.

739
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:42,410
Thank you, thank you.

740
00:41:43,830 --> 00:41:45,250
Mom, dad's home.

741
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,450
Pranav...son, come here.

742
00:41:50,370 --> 00:41:51,330
Fast.

743
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:53,370
- Come.
- What happened?

744
00:41:59,870 --> 00:42:03,160
This is an important document.

745
00:42:03,290 --> 00:42:05,120
Get me five photocopies of each.

746
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,330
And, have a fritter
or two while you're at it.

747
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:12,500
I finished work early today.

748
00:42:13,450 --> 00:42:15,450
Dad, money please.

749
00:42:16,830 --> 00:42:20,250
This is an important document.

750
00:42:20,370 --> 00:42:21,450
Get me five photocopies of each.

751
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:23,080
And, take your time.

752
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:26,410
"The next song was requested
by the king of Virar..."

753
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:28,080
"...Ashok and queen Sulochana."

754
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:29,330
"The ambience is heating up..."

755
00:42:29,450 --> 00:42:30,700
"...it's advisable to
keep your fans turned on."

756
00:42:30,790 --> 00:42:32,370
"The temperature
outside is 40 degrees,

757
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:33,620
...while inside..."

758
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:45,580
"Be my Queen,
and I'll build a palace for you."

759
00:42:45,790 --> 00:42:49,790
"Be my sweetheart,
and I'll build another Taj for you."

760
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:54,830
"Be my Queen,
and I'll build a palace for you."

761
00:42:55,250 --> 00:42:59,200
"Be my sweetheart,
and I'll build another Taj for you."

762
00:42:59,370 --> 00:43:01,540
"Listen Oh Queen..."

763
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:04,250
"Be my queen."

764
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:09,160
"I am your Shahjahan I'll
build another Taj for you."

765
00:43:09,410 --> 00:43:13,620
"Be my queen,
and I'll build a palace for you."

766
00:43:27,870 --> 00:43:32,330
"The fragrance
emanating from you..."

767
00:43:32,450 --> 00:43:36,540
"...doesn't let me sleep."

768
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:41,250
"I wake up at nights..."

769
00:43:41,830 --> 00:43:46,040
"...and think only about you."

770
00:43:46,410 --> 00:43:48,500
"Listen Oh Queen..."

771
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:50,700
"Be my Queen."

772
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:55,370
"Say yes...and
I'll rock the world."

773
00:43:56,410 --> 00:44:00,580
"Be my Queen,
and I'll build a palace for you."

774
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:10,540
"Let your eyes...stay
closer to mine."

775
00:44:10,790 --> 00:44:15,160
"Let your eyes...stay
closer to mine."

776
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:17,660
"Come sweetheart..."

777
00:44:17,870 --> 00:44:20,160
- "Come closer to my heart."
- What are you doing Ashok?

778
00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:22,540
- "Come sweetheart..."
- I got hurt.

779
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:24,700
"Come closer to my heart."

780
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:27,700
- "Let your eyes...stay closer to mine."
- Now clean it up!

781
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:29,870
What nonsense is this?
And what is this?

782
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:33,410
"Listen Oh Queen..."

783
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:36,200
"Be my Queen."

784
00:44:36,370 --> 00:44:40,910
"I am your Shahjahan
I'll build another Taj for you."

785
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:45,370
"Be my queen, and I'll
build a palace for you."

786
00:45:06,410 --> 00:45:07,330
Boys!

787
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:20,450
- What is this?
- Sir, it's his.

788
00:45:20,620 --> 00:45:23,000
- No, sir...it's him.
- No, sir...it's him.

789
00:45:23,250 --> 00:45:24,660
Boys, speak in English.

790
00:45:24,750 --> 00:45:27,160
- Sir, it was him.
- Sir, it was him.

791
00:45:29,290 --> 00:45:32,000
Your destiny is in your own hands.

792
00:45:32,250 --> 00:45:37,910
Diamonds don't shine in a day.

793
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:40,790
You have the talent,
so don't think twice.

794
00:45:44,870 --> 00:45:46,330
Don't eat that, play it.

795
00:45:47,790 --> 00:45:49,790
And, play only after
I finish speaking.

796
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,370
"Lateness causes darkness, but
darkness is better than disasters."

797
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:58,080
"JP...JP Papad brings you songs."

798
00:45:58,330 --> 00:46:01,120
"Songs that are
better than superhit."

799
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:03,410
Try using 'fresh' as well.

800
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:04,540
Yeah, yeah...

801
00:46:05,290 --> 00:46:07,080
Maria, at the beginning
or at the end?

802
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:08,620
Sir, tell us where?

803
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:10,290
Anywhere...in the middle.

804
00:46:10,410 --> 00:46:12,160
Great idea, put it in the middle.

805
00:46:15,700 --> 00:46:19,250
"JP...JP Papad brings
you fresh songs."

806
00:46:19,370 --> 00:46:21,200
"Songs that are
better than superhit."

807
00:46:21,290 --> 00:46:23,040
- Hello.
- Hello, Maria madam.

808
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:24,540
It's Sulochana.

809
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:26,580
- The contest winner.
- Can't talk right now.

810
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:31,160
But JP doesn't fit the meter.

811
00:46:31,370 --> 00:46:34,500
- But we don't want any meter, we want JP.
- Yeah.

812
00:46:34,580 --> 00:46:37,580
But that will sound cheap.
It will sound weird.

813
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:39,540
- Or I'll leave out fresh.
- No.

814
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:42,290
- If Papad isn't fresh, it won't taste good.
- Yeah.

815
00:46:42,410 --> 00:46:43,290
Hello.

816
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:45,200
I am here to light your nights...

817
00:46:45,330 --> 00:46:48,580
I said I can't talk,
stop calling me. You don't get it.

818
00:46:49,660 --> 00:46:51,290
You don't get it.

819
00:47:01,330 --> 00:47:04,660
- Can you add two more JP's?
- Good idea.

820
00:47:06,290 --> 00:47:08,370
- I can add 5 JPs.
- Excellent!

821
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:10,000
- 5 times.
- Yeah.

822
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:10,660
Listen to this.

823
00:47:10,750 --> 00:47:11,410
[I can do it.]

824
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:15,500
JP...JP...JP...JP...JP...
fresh and tasty JP.

825
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:18,250
- But where is the papad?
- Uh.....The crow took the papad.

826
00:47:18,370 --> 00:47:19,080
Okay.

827
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,410
- Crow?
- Crow?

828
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:24,620
What is he saying?
What's a crow?

829
00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:26,160
I am a poet.

830
00:47:26,790 --> 00:47:30,830
For the last four hours,
you've been ranting about papad.

831
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:32,870
Add this...add that...put
some glue in that...

832
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:35,120
I am fed up.

833
00:47:35,250 --> 00:47:37,620
Don't start that now.
That's enough...stop it.

834
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:40,750
- "There's a fire raging in my heart..."
- What's this nonsense?

835
00:47:40,870 --> 00:47:42,870
Sir, please sit down.

836
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:45,580
Instead of "ho ho",
can you do "papad"?

837
00:47:52,250 --> 00:47:54,040
Pankaj, he's recording everything.
What are you doing?

838
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:56,790
"Those who sell their souls,
will not be able to sleep a wink."

839
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,620
- Pankaj, stop it.
- I don't want this job.

840
00:47:58,700 --> 00:47:59,700
Go to hell.

841
00:47:59,790 --> 00:48:02,500
Sir, I am really sorry.
I'll be right back.

842
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:05,200
Pankaj, what are you doing?

843
00:48:05,330 --> 00:48:07,620
To hell with your job.
I am going.

844
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:10,000
Fine. Get lost.

845
00:48:10,370 --> 00:48:12,830
- Don't ever come back!
- Okay.

846
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:13,830
Anyone...

847
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:16,290
Anyone else wishes to quit?
Go ahead.

848
00:48:16,410 --> 00:48:19,410
Anyone else who thinks this
is a cheap job can join him.

849
00:48:23,250 --> 00:48:25,200
I'll be there by 7:30.

850
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:28,750
I'm hanging up now,
talk to you later.

851
00:48:29,330 --> 00:48:30,500
Okay, bye.

852
00:48:34,290 --> 00:48:36,620
- Ashok Dubey.
- Yes, Ashok Dubey.

853
00:48:37,750 --> 00:48:40,080
I am Sanjay. Great grandson.

854
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:42,040
Yeah...I know.

855
00:48:42,290 --> 00:48:43,620
We've met before.

856
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:45,410
- Really?
- Yeah...

857
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:50,330
- You helped me get my driver's license.
- Oh yes...

858
00:48:50,540 --> 00:48:52,500
You were quite young back then.

859
00:48:54,120 --> 00:49:03,250
So you see Ashok, I've decided to take
over Mathuradas and Great grandsons.

860
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:05,040
I see...

861
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:08,410
So, Ashok,
what I want you to do...

862
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:13,080
...give me all the sales reports...

863
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:17,540
...client reports, statement
of outstandings, balance sheets.

864
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:18,410
Today.

865
00:49:18,540 --> 00:49:19,750
As soon as they are ready...

866
00:49:19,870 --> 00:49:22,290
- Is it going to take time?
- Sir, it's a big pile.

867
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:25,620
- An hour or two?
- No...

868
00:49:26,330 --> 00:49:27,750
Will it take a day?

869
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:29,700
They don't have that long.

870
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:39,290
Pill...

871
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:40,580
Your pill.

872
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:47,750
And one more thing, Ashok.

873
00:49:48,790 --> 00:49:51,040
As you know,
there's a shortage of space.

874
00:49:51,370 --> 00:49:55,000
So I was thinking of
moving into your cabin.

875
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:59,660
And you...sit outside,
in the Admin section.

876
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:01,790
Come on now,
I'm sure you can adjust.

877
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,330
-There is no space outside, sir.
- It's alright.

878
00:50:04,450 --> 00:50:06,000
Just a second.

879
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:08,870
Hello.

880
00:50:09,660 --> 00:50:11,250
Mithu aunty...

881
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:15,410
Ashok, what's your salary?

882
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,080
It's Rs. 40,000.

883
00:50:18,410 --> 00:50:19,830
- Rs. 40,000?
- Yes.

884
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,500
Okay?
Carry on, thank you.

885
00:50:23,540 --> 00:50:24,950
Yeah...

886
00:50:25,750 --> 00:50:29,370
I don't want to eat onion curry.
How many times do I tell you?

887
00:50:29,580 --> 00:50:31,580
Tia knows I hate onion curry.

888
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:33,410
Yeah...

889
00:50:51,370 --> 00:51:00,000
"There's no fault in destiny,
look child, your destiny is upto you."

890
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:19,790
Let go.

891
00:51:19,870 --> 00:51:21,450
Let me check your diary
I haven't checked it for a long time.

892
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:24,000
Leave that. See this.

893
00:51:24,290 --> 00:51:25,330
Dad's home.

894
00:51:40,620 --> 00:51:41,580
Pranav.

895
00:51:55,540 --> 00:51:57,540
It's the second
time this month, Ashok.

896
00:51:57,790 --> 00:51:59,830
Very good, you're setting
a fine example for Pranav.

897
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:01,200
Bend down.

898
00:52:01,580 --> 00:52:03,790
Mom, dad's going to puke today.

899
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,910
- Quiet. Go get a towel.
- I'm telling you.

900
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,200
Sorry, Sulu.

901
00:52:11,450 --> 00:52:15,330
- That Mathuradas...
- Go sleep!

902
00:52:15,410 --> 00:52:19,250
I spent 12 years
to build all this...

903
00:52:19,330 --> 00:52:20,700
Anyone just appears
out of nowhere and...

904
00:52:20,790 --> 00:52:22,540
Why do you drink when
it doesn't suit you?

905
00:52:24,290 --> 00:52:26,660
Now you'll have
a headache tomorrow.

906
00:52:29,540 --> 00:52:30,830
Get some sleep.

907
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:40,620
- Sulu.
- Yes.

908
00:52:41,910 --> 00:52:43,700
They took my table.

909
00:52:44,750 --> 00:52:45,580
See...

910
00:52:46,540 --> 00:52:48,250
I didn't take a single day off.

911
00:52:49,620 --> 00:52:51,000
I worked so hard, and...

912
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:58,580
- Sorry.
- Let's talk tomorrow. Sleep now.

913
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:56,040
Hello, madam.

914
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:57,330
We have a gym, a cardio-section...

915
00:53:57,450 --> 00:53:58,870
...and, we just recently started
a Zumba section upstairs.

916
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:00,250
Would you like a tour?

917
00:54:00,370 --> 00:54:02,500
No, I am here for the job...

918
00:54:04,750 --> 00:54:05,750
Receptionist.

919
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:07,160
- Yes.
- What's your name?

920
00:54:07,290 --> 00:54:08,290
Sulochana.

921
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:12,450
- Where are you from?
- Virar...Jal Padma Society.

922
00:54:12,870 --> 00:54:14,080
Ever had a job before?

923
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:15,200
No.

924
00:54:23,540 --> 00:54:24,450
Coffee.

925
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:30,410
Traffic was bad today.

926
00:54:35,910 --> 00:54:39,410
So finally I wrote
a few lines on JP Papad.

927
00:54:40,330 --> 00:54:42,200
What did you say when you left?

928
00:54:42,620 --> 00:54:43,620
Sorry, Maria.

929
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,410
Say it aloud.

930
00:54:51,450 --> 00:54:53,450
"I don't want this cheap job."

931
00:54:53,660 --> 00:54:54,620
Remember...

932
00:54:54,830 --> 00:54:57,750
Remember how you got
this job in the first place.

933
00:54:58,040 --> 00:54:59,830
- I am sorry.
- Please go...

934
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:02,200
Go be a poet...do
whatever you want.

935
00:55:02,330 --> 00:55:04,040
Concentrate on your poetry.

936
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:06,250
"Fire raging..."
What was that you said?

937
00:55:06,370 --> 00:55:08,080
And you know what, I don't care.

938
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:09,540
I don't care.
Just go.

939
00:55:09,620 --> 00:55:11,700
I will convince JP sir.
I'm sorry.

940
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:16,370
I gave you this job
because you were a friend.

941
00:55:16,580 --> 00:55:18,580
I would rather give
this job to someone else.

942
00:55:18,660 --> 00:55:22,500
I mean...
how about that Saree-wearing aunty.

943
00:55:22,660 --> 00:55:24,120
So this is my gym.

944
00:55:24,330 --> 00:55:26,450
- Isn't it nice?
- Yeah.

945
00:55:26,580 --> 00:55:28,580
Just manage around.

946
00:55:29,250 --> 00:55:32,160
I'll talk to Ganpat sir.
That's not a problem.

947
00:55:33,370 --> 00:55:35,370
But, no sarees.

948
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:37,830
Right?

949
00:55:38,540 --> 00:55:40,080
Would you like to wear a saree?

950
00:55:41,370 --> 00:55:43,620
At least she had the hunger.

951
00:55:44,370 --> 00:55:45,500
She had the hunger...

952
00:55:45,580 --> 00:55:47,410
Look, let me show you.

953
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,250
Look...5 missed calls.

954
00:55:50,450 --> 00:55:51,830
She messages me all day.

955
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:53,540
"I can do it."

956
00:55:53,830 --> 00:55:56,580
I mean why not her?

957
00:56:00,250 --> 00:56:02,410
In fact, that's it.

958
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:04,580
This sounds like a plan.

959
00:56:06,660 --> 00:56:09,120
Saree-wearing aunty,
late night show.

960
00:56:09,330 --> 00:56:12,370
You'll have to wear a tracksuit,
along with shoes.

961
00:56:12,750 --> 00:56:15,120
Just get your own socks.

962
00:56:15,750 --> 00:56:18,160
Okay.
Whatever works for you.

963
00:56:18,370 --> 00:56:19,160
Okay.

964
00:56:21,620 --> 00:56:22,500
Sorry.

965
00:56:26,700 --> 00:56:27,790
Just a second.

966
00:56:29,750 --> 00:56:31,660
- Hello.
- Hi, Sulochana.

967
00:56:32,290 --> 00:56:34,290
- Yeah...
- Where are you?

968
00:56:34,830 --> 00:56:38,080
- At the gym?
- At this hour?

969
00:56:38,450 --> 00:56:39,660
Yes, this is my time.

970
00:56:39,870 --> 00:56:44,660
Listen...can you do
that 'Hello' bit for us?

971
00:56:45,870 --> 00:56:47,750
- Now?
- Yes, now.

972
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:52,160
"Hello..."

973
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:55,870
"I am here to
light up your nights..."

974
00:56:56,200 --> 00:57:00,410
"...and make your
dreams come true, it's Sulu."

975
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:03,370
"Dial my number
from your heart..."

976
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:05,120
"...and talk to me."

977
00:57:05,830 --> 00:57:06,830
"Won't you?"

978
00:57:10,830 --> 00:57:11,660
Yeah...

979
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:19,660
Maria, that's my show.

980
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,410
You can join from tomorrow.

981
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:29,580
6000 rupees a month and
30 rupees daily conveyance.

982
00:57:30,290 --> 00:57:32,700
No, thank you.
The salary is too low.

983
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:34,500
Up to Rs. 40,000

984
00:57:44,870 --> 00:57:45,830
Is she crazy?

985
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:48,830
Ashok... Ashok...

986
00:58:05,540 --> 00:58:07,540
Thank you.
Get this done.

987
00:58:11,580 --> 00:58:14,160
Sulochana, how was the gym?

988
00:58:14,290 --> 00:58:15,830
Sit down. Sit down.

989
00:58:18,450 --> 00:58:19,410
It was fine.

990
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,910
I'm sorry I couldn't
attend your calls yesterday.

991
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,290
I was having a crazy day.

992
00:58:24,450 --> 00:58:26,580
Even I was in a bad mood.

993
00:58:27,660 --> 00:58:30,870
Anyway, do you know why you're here?

994
00:58:31,910 --> 00:58:33,370
Pankaj, please play that.

995
00:58:36,250 --> 00:58:41,580
"I get tired dodging traffic all day."

996
00:58:41,660 --> 00:58:43,500
"I wish I had someone..."

997
00:58:43,580 --> 00:58:47,290
"...then, I would lie in her
arms and listen to my favorite songs."

998
00:58:47,370 --> 00:58:49,370
"Tell me what to do?"

999
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:52,330
How will you talk to him?

1000
00:58:53,870 --> 00:58:55,450
Me?

1001
00:59:05,830 --> 00:59:08,500
- I...don't know...
- Okay, Pankaj.

1002
00:59:08,830 --> 00:59:10,250
Look at me.

1003
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:15,200
Hello...

1004
00:59:16,870 --> 00:59:18,290
How are you, darling?

1005
00:59:20,250 --> 00:59:21,120
What?

1006
00:59:23,830 --> 00:59:26,290
I really like rickshaw drivers.

1007
00:59:26,580 --> 00:59:31,330
Imagine someday you
take me for a ride...

1008
00:59:31,580 --> 00:59:36,250
You press on the gas,
I won't step on the brakes

1009
00:59:36,700 --> 00:59:40,700
Sometimes you lean on me,
and sometimes I lean on you.

1010
00:59:40,950 --> 00:59:44,660
What are you thinking,
you naughty boy?

1011
00:59:45,250 --> 00:59:46,500
Yuck, who talks like that?

1012
00:59:46,580 --> 00:59:48,500
- I can't...
- No no no, I know.

1013
00:59:48,790 --> 00:59:50,790
Forget everything. Okay.

1014
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:54,330
Imagine you're talking
to your husband.

1015
00:59:54,620 --> 00:59:56,000
What is your husband's name?

1016
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:57,910
- Ashok.
- Okay. Excellent.

1017
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,950
So just think you're talking to Ashok.

1018
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:02,250
He's the rickshaw driver.

1019
01:00:02,660 --> 01:00:03,450
Now talk to him.

1020
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:09,540
What happened?

1021
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:14,500
You see, last year at the fancy dress
competition held in our building society...

1022
01:00:14,580 --> 01:00:17,500
...Ashok dressed up like a fisherman.

1023
01:00:18,290 --> 01:00:20,160
- So...
- Pankaj.

1024
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:22,160
Are you done?

1025
01:00:24,950 --> 01:00:25,870
Try?

1026
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:28,330
May I?

1027
01:00:31,540 --> 01:00:34,450
Hello, rickshaw driver.

1028
01:00:34,950 --> 01:00:36,250
Can I say Ashok instead?

1029
01:00:36,410 --> 01:00:38,830
Whatever.
However you're comfortable...

1030
01:00:42,370 --> 01:00:44,450
Hello Ashok...

1031
01:00:46,290 --> 01:00:53,540
You know what, Sulu wants you
to take her for a ride around Mumbai.

1032
01:00:56,790 --> 01:00:59,080
And, when you return home tired...

1033
01:00:59,290 --> 01:01:02,290
...then, I'll massage your head.

1034
01:01:02,620 --> 01:01:07,450
And, if that isn't enough,
I'll strangle your neck...

1035
01:01:07,790 --> 01:01:12,290
And if that isn't enough
I'll make you do all the laundry.

1036
01:01:12,580 --> 01:01:15,580
Now stop making excuses,
and listen to this song.

1037
01:01:15,830 --> 01:01:20,080
"Come slowly in my life."

1038
01:01:20,540 --> 01:01:22,290
Is that how you talk to your husband?

1039
01:01:22,660 --> 01:01:26,250
I say anything I like;
he's meek like a cow.

1040
01:01:28,540 --> 01:01:29,330
Just a...

1041
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:33,160
Hello, I'll call you back.

1042
01:01:35,450 --> 01:01:36,790
It was the cow.

1043
01:01:45,250 --> 01:01:46,700
Would you like to be an RJ?

1044
01:01:50,330 --> 01:01:51,250
Yeah...

1045
01:01:52,080 --> 01:01:53,000
Sure?

1046
01:01:54,950 --> 01:01:55,870
Sure.

1047
01:01:56,080 --> 01:01:58,500
It's a big risk for me. First timer.

1048
01:01:58,660 --> 01:02:00,250
I can lose my job over this.

1049
01:02:00,790 --> 01:02:01,790
Promise...

1050
01:02:02,790 --> 01:02:04,290
Will you train for it?

1051
01:02:05,830 --> 01:02:07,290
100 percent.

1052
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,910
It's a night show, will you come?

1053
01:02:12,290 --> 01:02:13,580
Have I got the job?

1054
01:02:13,830 --> 01:02:16,330
It's a night show, will you come?

1055
01:02:19,370 --> 01:02:22,160
Well, I failed in my higher secondary.

1056
01:02:43,620 --> 01:02:45,200
Something's definitely fishy.

1057
01:02:48,290 --> 01:02:51,080
Who pays Rs. 40,000 on your first job?

1058
01:02:51,250 --> 01:02:53,700
Get down... you can't fix that.

1059
01:02:53,830 --> 01:02:55,200
I'll call the electrician.

1060
01:02:55,410 --> 01:02:56,450
I am doing it.

1061
01:02:59,540 --> 01:03:01,200
And, there's nothing fishy.

1062
01:03:01,450 --> 01:03:03,120
They said up to Rs. 40,000.

1063
01:03:03,330 --> 01:03:05,870
So, they will give
me at least Rs. 30,000.

1064
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:07,370
They will pay me something.

1065
01:03:07,580 --> 01:03:09,080
I'll be an RJ, Ashok.

1066
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:12,120
My voice will be heard on radio.

1067
01:03:12,370 --> 01:03:15,000
They must be joking, and you...

1068
01:03:15,660 --> 01:03:17,370
They will fool you.

1069
01:03:19,290 --> 01:03:21,250
Sulu...Sulu...

1070
01:03:26,660 --> 01:03:28,750
All alone, at night...

1071
01:03:31,160 --> 01:03:34,160
You said that I can take
up a job when Pranav grows up.

1072
01:03:34,290 --> 01:03:36,540
Yeah... I mean you just went for it...

1073
01:03:36,700 --> 01:03:40,080
- ...when you could've called.
- I did, but you were drunk...

1074
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,000
Great...

1075
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:47,290
You're doing great, Mrs. Sulochana.

1076
01:03:47,410 --> 01:03:49,120
Do what you feel like.

1077
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:51,500
Did you have to go today?

1078
01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:53,660
We could've talked this over.

1079
01:03:55,790 --> 01:03:56,910
Fine, I won't go.

1080
01:03:57,370 --> 01:03:58,290
Sulu...

1081
01:03:59,290 --> 01:04:02,000
Why are you always glued to the phone?

1082
01:04:08,790 --> 01:04:09,790
The bulb's dead too.

1083
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:19,330
See that...

1084
01:04:20,540 --> 01:04:22,540
That's the recording booth.

1085
01:04:24,660 --> 01:04:25,750
Coffee.

1086
01:04:27,500 --> 01:04:28,620
Thank you.

1087
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:30,160
This...

1088
01:04:30,330 --> 01:04:31,660
Just take my word.

1089
01:04:31,830 --> 01:04:33,370
I promise I won't let you down.

1090
01:04:33,540 --> 01:04:35,080
Thank you, Karan.
Thank you.

1091
01:04:35,290 --> 01:04:36,950
Look forward. Bye.

1092
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,620
So... Champion, what's up?

1093
01:04:40,870 --> 01:04:42,830
- My husband, Ashok.
- Hi.

1094
01:04:44,330 --> 01:04:45,040
Hi.

1095
01:04:45,330 --> 01:04:47,250
Very nice to meet you.
Please, sit down.

1096
01:04:49,620 --> 01:04:52,620
So, what did you decide?
Are you doing it or not?

1097
01:04:53,370 --> 01:04:55,370
- Ask.
- What?

1098
01:04:56,370 --> 01:04:57,870
You had questions.

1099
01:04:58,290 --> 01:05:00,000
Shoot! You can ask me anything.

1100
01:05:00,250 --> 01:05:02,450
No, everything...fine.

1101
01:05:04,700 --> 01:05:07,830
Late night...safety...

1102
01:05:08,080 --> 01:05:10,200
We'll take care of the transportation.

1103
01:05:10,290 --> 01:05:12,040
Pick-up, drop... we'll do everything.

1104
01:05:12,120 --> 01:05:14,330
So, there is nothing to worry about.

1105
01:05:16,370 --> 01:05:17,120
Nice.

1106
01:05:18,620 --> 01:05:19,250
Nice.

1107
01:05:19,290 --> 01:05:21,750
You were asking about the salary.

1108
01:05:22,040 --> 01:05:23,410
- What?
- Salary?

1109
01:05:23,790 --> 01:05:24,870
- Didn't you discuss the salary with her?
- Relax.

1110
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:28,250
Sir, it's nothing.

1111
01:05:29,250 --> 01:05:30,200
- It's nothing.
- Nothing.

1112
01:05:30,290 --> 01:05:31,870
- So, we're good to go?
- Yes.

1113
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:33,000
Excellent.

1114
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:34,870
Excuse me.

1115
01:05:39,910 --> 01:05:42,040
Shall we call the show,
'Tumhari Sulu'?

1116
01:05:42,700 --> 01:05:44,160
Yeah, it's nice.

1117
01:05:44,290 --> 01:05:45,540
It's nice, huh?

1118
01:05:45,620 --> 01:05:47,040
So we're ready to fly.

1119
01:05:47,950 --> 01:05:48,950
Excellent.

1120
01:05:50,290 --> 01:05:51,000
- Good Luck.
- Thank you.

1121
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:53,660
Welcome to Radio Wow.
It's 10:30 in the morning.

1122
01:05:53,790 --> 01:05:57,290
It's the amazing Featherlite,
furniture rock-solid hit show...

1123
01:05:57,370 --> 01:05:59,870
...which lets you touch the sky.

1124
01:06:00,120 --> 01:06:03,040
It will compel your heart to go crazy.

1125
01:06:03,250 --> 01:06:06,500
It will make your heart
say Wow...this is wow."

1126
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:17,370
"There's no one to stop me."

1127
01:06:17,700 --> 01:06:20,580
"Hold on to your dreams."

1128
01:06:21,370 --> 01:06:24,540
"Happiness has swooped down on me..."

1129
01:06:24,950 --> 01:06:27,660
"...as I opened my eyes."

1130
01:06:28,290 --> 01:06:31,580
"My heart's filled with passion..."

1131
01:06:31,870 --> 01:06:35,290
"...as my heart beats with the tune."

1132
01:06:39,080 --> 01:06:42,410
"My heart's filled with passion..."

1133
01:06:42,620 --> 01:06:46,000
"...as my heart beats with the tune."

1134
01:06:46,290 --> 01:06:48,830
"Why should I be shy?"

1135
01:06:49,250 --> 01:06:52,660
"The heart wants to spread
its wings and likes to fly."

1136
01:06:52,910 --> 01:06:56,250
"The world pulls,
pulls, pulls, keeps on trying."

1137
01:06:56,410 --> 01:06:59,870
"The heart wants to spread
its wings and likes to fly."

1138
01:07:00,120 --> 01:07:03,830
"The world pull,
pull, pulls, keeps on trying."

1139
01:07:25,540 --> 01:07:28,330
You're with Albeli Anjali
on another beautiful morning.

1140
01:07:28,410 --> 01:07:30,540
It's time for your traffic update.

1141
01:07:30,870 --> 01:07:31,870
Stay tuned.

1142
01:07:35,910 --> 01:07:37,580
"These days for real..."

1143
01:07:37,660 --> 01:07:39,250
"...I am in touch with life."

1144
01:07:39,450 --> 01:07:42,830
"Even the world feels
like a close friend."

1145
01:07:43,120 --> 01:07:46,330
"These moments now
are dictating my dreams."

1146
01:07:46,620 --> 01:07:50,080
"And I am walking down
the hope lane."

1147
01:07:50,620 --> 01:07:52,580
Say what...it's wow.

1148
01:07:52,870 --> 01:07:54,870
And I am RJ Sulu.

1149
01:07:55,790 --> 01:07:56,950
RJ Sulu.

1150
01:08:04,410 --> 01:08:06,450
"The heart's a little sweet..."

1151
01:08:07,830 --> 01:08:09,700
"...and just a little stubborn."

1152
01:08:11,620 --> 01:08:15,000
"The heart's a little sweet
and a little stubborn."

1153
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:18,580
"It's a little twisted...and
a little straight."

1154
01:08:18,870 --> 01:08:21,080
"But it's one of us."

1155
01:08:25,950 --> 01:08:27,040
Hello...

1156
01:08:27,950 --> 01:08:30,660
- Can be sexier.
- No, this is good.

1157
01:08:32,330 --> 01:08:35,950
"The heart wants to spread
its wings and likes to fly."

1158
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:39,330
"The world pull,
pull, pulls, keeps on trying."

1159
01:08:39,540 --> 01:08:42,450
"The heart wants to spread
its wings and likes to fly."

1160
01:09:29,950 --> 01:09:31,370
Wow...nice.

1161
01:09:31,660 --> 01:09:32,450
Look.

1162
01:09:32,620 --> 01:09:33,540
Show me that one.

1163
01:09:34,450 --> 01:09:35,700
- Want some?
- Yes.

1164
01:09:36,870 --> 01:09:37,870
Enough.

1165
01:09:38,450 --> 01:09:40,000
- Brother-in-law?
- Just a little.

1166
01:09:40,700 --> 01:09:41,500
Enough.

1167
01:09:41,660 --> 01:09:42,910
- Want some?
- No.

1168
01:09:45,620 --> 01:09:48,620
This probably has a clock.

1169
01:09:50,790 --> 01:09:52,450
I'm going to work at a radio station.

1170
01:09:55,450 --> 01:09:57,450
Radio Jockey...RJ.

1171
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:02,250
- Like Albeli Anjali?
- She's my friend.

1172
01:10:02,450 --> 01:10:03,660
Who? Albeli Anjali?

1173
01:10:03,790 --> 01:10:04,700
- Yes?
- Your friend?

1174
01:10:04,790 --> 01:10:06,540
- Yes.
- Says who?

1175
01:10:06,790 --> 01:10:09,500
Pranav, what are you doing?
Put it down, that's expensive.

1176
01:10:09,750 --> 01:10:10,620
Keep it down.

1177
01:10:11,500 --> 01:10:12,830
And your salary?

1178
01:10:13,830 --> 01:10:14,830
Starting Rs. 30,000

1179
01:10:21,870 --> 01:10:23,950
And 3 months later, Rs. 40,000

1180
01:10:24,540 --> 01:10:26,700
Rs. 30,000 during probation?

1181
01:10:26,870 --> 01:10:28,450
What's your job, Sulu?

1182
01:10:30,200 --> 01:10:31,200
To talk, daddy.

1183
01:10:31,620 --> 01:10:34,500
They will pay her Rs. 40,000
in a month for talking.

1184
01:10:34,580 --> 01:10:35,790
- Right, sis.
- Yes, sis.

1185
01:10:37,660 --> 01:10:38,660
Right, Ashok?

1186
01:10:39,080 --> 01:10:39,790
Huh...

1187
01:10:40,160 --> 01:10:42,450
Leave now, Kamla.
You can clean up later.

1188
01:10:43,700 --> 01:10:44,250
Here.

1189
01:10:44,410 --> 01:10:48,540
Radio Jockey?
Is Chulbuli Anjali your friend?

1190
01:10:49,080 --> 01:10:50,910
That's Albeli Anjali.

1191
01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:53,080
Your sisters will
now hound you here on.

1192
01:10:53,250 --> 01:10:54,200
"Right, sis. Yes, sis."

1193
01:10:54,290 --> 01:10:56,080
You said I should tell them.

1194
01:10:56,160 --> 01:10:58,500
Right, because you
always do what I say.

1195
01:10:59,830 --> 01:11:01,790
Sulu, why don't you try it out first?

1196
01:11:01,910 --> 01:11:03,120
Whether it suits you or not.

1197
01:11:03,410 --> 01:11:05,000
Normally you're down and out by 9 P.M.

1198
01:11:05,080 --> 01:11:06,080
I won't now.

1199
01:11:06,950 --> 01:11:10,040
Sulu, why did you have
to tell them it's a night show?

1200
01:11:14,410 --> 01:11:16,160
Are you on my side or theirs?

1201
01:11:20,790 --> 01:11:22,200
Am I doing the right thing, Ashok?

1202
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:27,040
"Hello..."

1203
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:31,830
"Your problems, your loneliness..."

1204
01:11:31,950 --> 01:11:36,040
"...the sound of your broken heart,
your life."

1205
01:11:36,160 --> 01:11:38,950
"Your Sulu is going
to listen to all of it."

1206
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:42,040
"Call me...and talk to me.

1207
01:11:42,870 --> 01:11:43,950
"Won't you."

1208
01:11:45,290 --> 01:11:49,620
Bread's in the hot plate,
No need to reheat it.

1209
01:11:50,040 --> 01:11:52,200
- Sulochana madam, radio?
- Yeah...

1210
01:11:52,700 --> 01:11:53,410
Come.

1211
01:11:54,870 --> 01:11:56,410
- Drive carefully.
- Okay?

1212
01:12:00,450 --> 01:12:01,290
Okay?

1213
01:12:02,910 --> 01:12:04,120
Listen...

1214
01:12:04,870 --> 01:12:05,830
Should I come along?

1215
01:12:05,870 --> 01:12:08,750
Don't worry sir,
I'm carrying a pepper spray.

1216
01:12:08,870 --> 01:12:10,410
Madam is completely safe.

1217
01:12:11,250 --> 01:12:11,910
Bye.

1218
01:12:12,290 --> 01:12:13,330
Best of luck.

1219
01:12:14,790 --> 01:12:15,660
Bye.

1220
01:12:30,410 --> 01:12:31,870
Can I tell you something, madam?

1221
01:12:32,540 --> 01:12:35,080
I have a male friend

1222
01:12:35,450 --> 01:12:37,000
He also drives a taxi.

1223
01:12:37,700 --> 01:12:39,500
He picked up a female passenger
who was seated at the back.

1224
01:12:39,580 --> 01:12:41,410
She lowered the window...

1225
01:12:41,660 --> 01:12:43,830
...and a guy approached
the car on a scooter...

1226
01:12:44,040 --> 01:12:46,040
Hey, look where you're going, you.....

1227
01:12:49,500 --> 01:12:50,700
Sorry, madam.

1228
01:12:50,830 --> 01:12:54,700
Anything is possible these days.
It's hard to trust anyone.

1229
01:12:58,750 --> 01:13:00,410
- Play a song.
- Which one?

1230
01:13:00,660 --> 01:13:03,660
- Anything.
- I've new as well as old songs.

1231
01:13:03,750 --> 01:13:05,660
How about Rafi, Lata, or Asha?

1232
01:13:06,540 --> 01:13:08,660
Pakistanis sing really well, madam.

1233
01:13:08,870 --> 01:13:10,330
But I stopped playing their songs...

1234
01:13:10,450 --> 01:13:12,000
...because these days...

1235
01:13:12,080 --> 01:13:14,830
...people get offended over
anything and break your window.

1236
01:13:16,910 --> 01:13:18,910
Actually, madam...

1237
01:13:20,120 --> 01:13:21,750
Sulu, I found the sugar
but I can't find the tea leaves.

1238
01:13:21,950 --> 01:13:23,580
Top shelf.

1239
01:13:24,120 --> 01:13:25,000
Butter...

1240
01:13:26,450 --> 01:13:28,580
Why do you keep tea leaves
all the way at the back?

1241
01:13:28,910 --> 01:13:30,250
Can you make tea?

1242
01:13:32,540 --> 01:13:35,450
I'll have to get used to it now,
RJ Sulu.

1243
01:13:36,410 --> 01:13:37,950
From tomorrow I'll
make tea before I leave.

1244
01:13:38,200 --> 01:13:39,790
Hello... Hello...

1245
01:13:42,910 --> 01:13:44,080
Hello... Hello...

1246
01:13:46,040 --> 01:13:47,330
First job, madam?

1247
01:13:48,620 --> 01:13:49,080
Yeah.

1248
01:13:49,160 --> 01:13:51,910
Even my husband would miss me a lot.

1249
01:13:52,540 --> 01:13:55,080
He would have fish fry with his drink.

1250
01:13:55,450 --> 01:13:58,040
Later he started ordering it from out.

1251
01:13:59,160 --> 01:14:01,410
And now he's left me.

1252
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:04,080
But things are good now.

1253
01:14:04,660 --> 01:14:07,250
I have this car...
it's a respectable job.

1254
01:14:07,750 --> 01:14:09,620
That's the limit.

1255
01:14:09,700 --> 01:14:13,500
7 oceans,
7 fairies, 7 poems, 7 tunes...

1256
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:18,120
- Welcome. Welcome, RJ Sulu.
- Thank you.

1257
01:14:18,370 --> 01:14:19,410
- Hello.
- How are you?

1258
01:14:19,870 --> 01:14:21,250
Come, please come.

1259
01:14:24,370 --> 01:14:25,700
Hello, Deepak.

1260
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:28,790
Deepak, why do you sound so nervous?

1261
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:30,950
I am right here, don't be so nervous.

1262
01:14:31,870 --> 01:14:33,660
I'll call you later, huh.

1263
01:14:36,500 --> 01:14:37,830
- Dinner?
- No.

1264
01:14:37,870 --> 01:14:39,660
Maria, would you like some dinner?

1265
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:42,410
Maria isn't hungry and neither am I.

1266
01:14:43,290 --> 01:14:43,830
May I?

1267
01:15:29,290 --> 01:15:30,290
Good luck.

1268
01:15:35,120 --> 01:15:36,790
Hello, Sulu.

1269
01:15:41,410 --> 01:15:42,580
Hello...

1270
01:15:44,790 --> 01:15:46,450
Say it again, madam.

1271
01:15:48,540 --> 01:15:49,660
Hello...

1272
01:15:50,370 --> 01:15:51,410
Hello...

1273
01:15:51,830 --> 01:15:53,500
I just can't do it.

1274
01:15:54,790 --> 01:15:58,200
Who wants to talk to Sulu?

1275
01:15:58,660 --> 01:16:01,950
Madam, my name is Ramesh.

1276
01:16:02,370 --> 01:16:04,870
And, you have a really sweet voice.

1277
01:16:09,620 --> 01:16:12,830
Actually, madam...I'm stuck
in a situation of sorts.

1278
01:16:13,160 --> 01:16:17,950
I'm in love with two sisters.

1279
01:16:18,500 --> 01:16:21,500
Sharmila and Pramila.

1280
01:16:21,910 --> 01:16:25,620
Tell me...whom do I choose?

1281
01:16:25,830 --> 01:16:27,870
I am a little confused.

1282
01:16:29,450 --> 01:16:32,250
Hello madam? Hello?

1283
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:37,000
Please tell me.
Have you gone to sleep?

1284
01:16:37,580 --> 01:16:39,790
Peel some peas with me.

1285
01:16:41,120 --> 01:16:42,330
Peas?

1286
01:16:42,580 --> 01:16:44,950
Are you cooking, madam?

1287
01:16:46,080 --> 01:16:52,080
Ramesh, your problem is similar
to the problem peas seem to have.

1288
01:16:53,500 --> 01:16:57,160
Peas taste nice with potatoes...

1289
01:16:58,580 --> 01:17:00,580
...as well as with cottage cheese.

1290
01:17:01,870 --> 01:17:04,830
Now tell me what you like.

1291
01:17:05,620 --> 01:17:08,620
Oh, madam...
Please tell me.

1292
01:17:09,250 --> 01:17:10,250
Fine...

1293
01:17:12,290 --> 01:17:16,410
Right now I am holding
two pea pods in my hand.

1294
01:17:17,080 --> 01:17:19,870
Pramila and Sharmila.

1295
01:17:22,200 --> 01:17:24,790
Pramila mixes with
the cottage cheese...

1296
01:17:25,540 --> 01:17:28,500
...and Sharmila with the potatoes.

1297
01:17:30,830 --> 01:17:32,950
Who would you go with, Ramesh?

1298
01:17:34,870 --> 01:17:35,870
Me?

1299
01:17:36,080 --> 01:17:37,620
Yes you.

1300
01:17:38,250 --> 01:17:39,450
With Sulu.

1301
01:17:40,540 --> 01:17:41,290
Hey...

1302
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,660
You're really naughty, Sulu.

1303
01:17:47,080 --> 01:17:48,250
Thank you.

1304
01:17:49,500 --> 01:17:54,200
- So, what are you doing right now?
- Nothing.

1305
01:17:54,580 --> 01:17:57,580
Then do something.

1306
01:17:58,950 --> 01:18:01,700
Will do, will do.

1307
01:18:02,040 --> 01:18:04,000
Daddy, what are you doing?

1308
01:18:08,660 --> 01:18:11,370
- Checking the salt.
- That's my plate.

1309
01:18:13,540 --> 01:18:14,830
How many rotis do you eat?

1310
01:18:15,160 --> 01:18:16,450
You don't know?

1311
01:18:17,160 --> 01:18:20,700
Sulu, can you please
sing a romantic song?

1312
01:18:31,580 --> 01:18:34,910
"Batata Vada..."

1313
01:18:35,580 --> 01:18:38,830
"Batata Vada..."

1314
01:18:39,870 --> 01:18:43,500
"I didn't want to lose my heart...

1315
01:18:43,870 --> 01:18:46,870
"But I had to."

1316
01:18:47,160 --> 01:18:49,870
Amazing. Please give
me your number, madam.

1317
01:18:50,080 --> 01:18:50,950
Write it down.

1318
01:18:51,910 --> 01:18:55,910
1... 0... 0...

1319
01:18:57,250 --> 01:18:58,700
What madam?

1320
01:19:01,410 --> 01:19:02,790
Oh really...

1321
01:19:04,200 --> 01:19:06,540
Ashok? Pranav?

1322
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:09,040
- Is that your son?
- Yeah.

1323
01:19:09,290 --> 01:19:10,830
- Hey buddy.
- Hi.

1324
01:19:10,870 --> 01:19:12,790
- I am Maria.
- Pranav Dubey.

1325
01:19:14,080 --> 01:19:15,450
Nice to meet you.

1326
01:19:15,700 --> 01:19:18,910
He couldn't sleep, so I thought...

1327
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,410
I was fast asleep, but dad wasn't.

1328
01:19:22,370 --> 01:19:25,620
No... We go out...
via walk... night...

1329
01:19:25,750 --> 01:19:26,870
It's okay.

1330
01:19:27,620 --> 01:19:29,660
- She was very good.
- Bye, Maria.

1331
01:19:30,290 --> 01:19:31,700
- Okay.
- Bye.

1332
01:19:31,910 --> 01:19:33,330
Okay, Sulu take care.

1333
01:19:33,580 --> 01:19:34,410
Bye buddy.

1334
01:19:35,750 --> 01:19:36,660
See you, Ashok.

1335
01:19:38,620 --> 01:19:40,410
- Did you hear?
- Yeah...

1336
01:19:40,580 --> 01:19:41,910
Let's go home and talk.

1337
01:19:49,450 --> 01:19:51,700
You were amazing, madam.

1338
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:55,700
Sir, madam was fabulous.

1339
01:19:55,910 --> 01:19:57,870
I mean her voice...
"Hello."

1340
01:20:00,450 --> 01:20:01,540
Did you like it?

1341
01:20:03,080 --> 01:20:05,000
Yeah, I heard some of it.

1342
01:20:05,250 --> 01:20:06,750
You were singing.

1343
01:20:07,870 --> 01:20:09,200
But, not the entire part.

1344
01:20:09,370 --> 01:20:11,660
Stop lying, dad.

1345
01:20:11,790 --> 01:20:13,790
You had the headphones
on the entire time.

1346
01:20:13,870 --> 01:20:16,950
Pranav...
That's nonsense.

1347
01:20:24,450 --> 01:20:26,790
So...now, tell me honestly.

1348
01:20:27,500 --> 01:20:28,410
Didn't you hear all of it?

1349
01:20:32,120 --> 01:20:34,660
"Batata Vada..."

1350
01:20:36,620 --> 01:20:38,790
"Batata Vada..."

1351
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:40,370
Sorry, Ashok...

1352
01:20:41,870 --> 01:20:45,450
- "Batata Vada..."
- It slipped out my mouth?

1353
01:20:46,410 --> 01:20:47,410
Hey...

1354
01:20:47,870 --> 01:20:48,870
Sorry.

1355
01:20:50,250 --> 01:20:52,620
"Batata Vada..."

1356
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,830
Wow, I see the lion
was in the mood today

1357
01:21:03,750 --> 01:21:04,830
Sulu.

1358
01:21:06,160 --> 01:21:09,410
Don't you think Pranav needs a sister?

1359
01:21:10,660 --> 01:21:11,700
Priyanka.

1360
01:21:14,040 --> 01:21:15,700
Aren't we a little late?

1361
01:21:15,830 --> 01:21:17,910
- Priyanka.
- I don't think so.

1362
01:21:19,620 --> 01:21:24,500
So...you want to be
Priyanka's old father.

1363
01:21:25,910 --> 01:21:26,830
Meaning?

1364
01:21:27,120 --> 01:21:31,660
I mean her classmates
will call you grandpa.

1365
01:21:34,500 --> 01:21:35,500
Is that okay?

1366
01:21:37,200 --> 01:21:37,910
Yes.

1367
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:40,750
Really?

1368
01:21:45,540 --> 01:21:46,580
Grandpa.

1369
01:21:57,540 --> 01:21:58,910
And finished your tiffin as well.

1370
01:22:05,950 --> 01:22:06,830
Pranav...

1371
01:22:24,500 --> 01:22:26,950
- Hello. Ashok?
- Yes.

1372
01:22:27,370 --> 01:22:30,040
- Did you two leave?
- Yes, you were asleep.

1373
01:22:30,120 --> 01:22:33,700
- So, I thought why to disturb you...
- I...

1374
01:22:33,830 --> 01:22:36,370
But your lunch, and Pranav's?

1375
01:22:36,450 --> 01:22:39,080
I got Pranav ready
and sent him off to school.

1376
01:22:39,700 --> 01:22:41,450
He'll eat at the canteen today.

1377
01:22:41,910 --> 01:22:42,700
Okay.

1378
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:44,620
- Bye.
- Bye.

1379
01:23:01,660 --> 01:23:03,160
So that's your new job?

1380
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:06,410
- You all heard it?
- Yes, we did.

1381
01:23:06,540 --> 01:23:08,000
- Very good...it was nice.
- Huh...

1382
01:23:08,290 --> 01:23:09,830
Potatoes, peas...cottage cheese.

1383
01:23:09,910 --> 01:23:11,370
What nonsense is this, Sulu?

1384
01:23:11,620 --> 01:23:13,700
Pramila and Sharmila.

1385
01:23:13,910 --> 01:23:16,200
Quit this job...and find
a job with a creche or something.

1386
01:23:16,450 --> 01:23:16,870
Why?

1387
01:23:16,910 --> 01:23:19,330
Do you have any idea?
We were all listening to your show.

1388
01:23:19,450 --> 01:23:20,790
Even the kids.

1389
01:23:20,870 --> 01:23:23,120
- What did I say wrong?
- Do you hear that, sis?

1390
01:23:23,250 --> 01:23:24,040
She wants to know what's wrong.

1391
01:23:24,120 --> 01:23:26,250
This doesn't suit
our family values, Sulu

1392
01:23:26,500 --> 01:23:27,500
Hello...Disgusting.

1393
01:23:27,580 --> 01:23:29,000
What's the problem, sister?

1394
01:23:29,160 --> 01:23:30,950
You're going to talk
to any cheapster at night.

1395
01:23:31,040 --> 01:23:32,910
Do you have any idea
what you're doing?

1396
01:23:33,040 --> 01:23:34,830
Cheapster...what cheapster?

1397
01:23:35,660 --> 01:23:37,790
- It's just acting.
- Then don't do it.

1398
01:23:38,080 --> 01:23:41,620
Tomorrow if you get paid better at
a nightclub will you take that up too?

1399
01:23:42,450 --> 01:23:43,830
Look at her temper.

1400
01:23:44,410 --> 01:23:47,410
- Ashok, how can you allow this?
- No...

1401
01:23:48,500 --> 01:23:51,910
We talked this out.
I told her to try it out for a month.

1402
01:23:52,040 --> 01:23:52,950
This cannot continue.

1403
01:23:53,160 --> 01:23:55,830
Forget it, Ashok...that's
the problem with them...

1404
01:23:55,910 --> 01:23:57,000
...that's why I wasn't telling them.

1405
01:23:57,120 --> 01:23:59,330
I wanted to do a beautician
course after school...

1406
01:23:59,450 --> 01:24:00,370
...but they stopped me
from doing that as well.

1407
01:24:00,450 --> 01:24:02,870
Enough of your charade.
shut up and sit down.

1408
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:06,000
Didn't you guys go
out of the city for audit?

1409
01:24:06,120 --> 01:24:08,080
Leaving your husbands at home?
I guess that was acceptable?

1410
01:24:08,160 --> 01:24:10,250
- Sulu, she's your older sister...!
- Daddy...

1411
01:24:10,410 --> 01:24:12,080
Hold on...hold on, daddy.

1412
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:14,540
Yes, we did Sulu...
but it's a respectable job.

1413
01:24:14,660 --> 01:24:17,950
We don't get paid to sweet-talk
any random cheapster.

1414
01:24:18,040 --> 01:24:19,750
There's no point talking to you both.

1415
01:24:19,870 --> 01:24:20,950
Fine, then don't.

1416
01:24:21,040 --> 01:24:22,330
But tomorrow if you're in trouble...

1417
01:24:22,450 --> 01:24:23,620
...you will come running to us.

1418
01:24:23,750 --> 01:24:25,950
Of course I will,
after all you are my family

1419
01:24:27,500 --> 01:24:28,580
Look at her.

1420
01:24:29,160 --> 01:24:31,080
- Ashok.
- Sulu, you won't go anywhere.

1421
01:24:31,790 --> 01:24:32,910
Sulu...

1422
01:24:33,290 --> 01:24:37,330
I mean, let's talk
this over in case...

1423
01:24:40,040 --> 01:24:41,580
Pranav's slept off early.

1424
01:24:41,870 --> 01:24:43,660
Give him his dinner when he wakes up.

1425
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:47,040
Ashok?

1426
01:24:48,290 --> 01:24:49,700
Look at her.

1427
01:24:59,580 --> 01:25:00,700
Shall I play a song?

1428
01:25:01,500 --> 01:25:02,410
No...

1429
01:25:29,660 --> 01:25:30,700
Hello Sulu...

1430
01:25:31,700 --> 01:25:33,250
You were amazing.

1431
01:25:34,250 --> 01:25:36,080
Hit it out of the park
on day one itself...!!!

1432
01:25:36,580 --> 01:25:38,540
More than 200 call requests.

1433
01:25:38,870 --> 01:25:40,450
This calls for a party.

1434
01:25:40,660 --> 01:25:41,830
Surprise!

1435
01:25:43,250 --> 01:25:44,410
You did it!

1436
01:25:45,080 --> 01:25:46,830
Sulu! Sulu!

1437
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:48,540
What happened?

1438
01:25:48,910 --> 01:25:52,330
Can I do the show during the day?

1439
01:25:52,660 --> 01:25:54,790
Don't look down when
you're climbing up.

1440
01:25:54,910 --> 01:25:56,200
You'll get scared.

1441
01:25:58,290 --> 01:26:03,040
"I am the princess of your dreams.
I'm the one that rules every heart."

1442
01:26:07,700 --> 01:26:11,910
"I am the princess of your dreams.
I'm the one that rules every heart."

1443
01:26:12,290 --> 01:26:16,580
"My tresses are like the clouds,
and my gait's like lightening."

1444
01:26:16,910 --> 01:26:21,040
"I'm here to strike
like lightening."

1445
01:26:21,500 --> 01:26:25,120
"I'm here to strike like lightening."

1446
01:26:26,120 --> 01:26:29,500
"And they call me...Hawa Hawai."

1447
01:26:47,950 --> 01:26:48,950
Hello...

1448
01:26:49,500 --> 01:26:51,750
Who wants to talk to Sulu?

1449
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:43,080
Come on.

1450
01:27:43,500 --> 01:27:46,080
- Pranav.
- Oh no, I forgot to charge my mobile.

1451
01:27:46,500 --> 01:27:48,250
- Do it at the office.
- Yeah...

1452
01:27:54,370 --> 01:27:56,830
Pranav, there's a surprise
for you in your lunchbox.

1453
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,620
- Did you find your earphones?
- Yeah, they were in my bag.

1454
01:28:00,910 --> 01:28:02,370
- Hi!
- Hi!

1455
01:28:02,700 --> 01:28:04,790
- What's up?
- All good. How are you?

1456
01:28:05,080 --> 01:28:07,120
Good...little busy.

1457
01:28:07,450 --> 01:28:09,000
- Okay.
- So sweet.

1458
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:13,750
Yes, sir.

1459
01:28:13,870 --> 01:28:16,950
We just recently
moved into our new home.

1460
01:28:17,120 --> 01:28:20,790
The pest control,
plumber, etc. are coming.

1461
01:28:20,870 --> 01:28:22,120
So just go and help them out.

1462
01:28:22,250 --> 01:28:24,790
I'll send the peon,
he knows everything.

1463
01:28:24,870 --> 01:28:26,660
- What? Peon?
- Yeah.

1464
01:28:26,790 --> 01:28:28,120
He won't be able to handle it.

1465
01:28:28,450 --> 01:28:29,200
You go.

1466
01:28:33,500 --> 01:28:35,370
Hello, Mithu aunty.

1467
01:28:36,160 --> 01:28:38,250
Leakage? What happened?

1468
01:28:39,620 --> 01:28:41,750
I am sending someone.

1469
01:28:42,040 --> 01:28:43,450
Do you want to see me get divorced?

1470
01:28:43,700 --> 01:28:44,290
Go on.

1471
01:28:45,870 --> 01:28:48,620
- And who has the cheque book?
- I do...

1472
01:28:48,700 --> 01:28:50,750
Right, leave it on my table.

1473
01:28:50,870 --> 01:28:51,790
Hello.

1474
01:28:52,580 --> 01:28:55,080
I don't understand why
you fret over these small things.

1475
01:28:55,370 --> 01:28:57,250
Hello
Sulochana madam

1476
01:29:13,660 --> 01:29:14,410
Bye, sir.

1477
01:29:14,620 --> 01:29:16,830
Mr. Dubey,
taking the rest of the day off?

1478
01:29:17,040 --> 01:29:18,750
No, sir.
I leave every day at this time.

1479
01:29:18,830 --> 01:29:22,200
Actually...I've some work
to take care of at home.

1480
01:29:22,450 --> 01:29:24,830
Why don't you get some work
done around the office as well?

1481
01:29:25,080 --> 01:29:26,660
Meet me in my cabin in 20 minutes.

1482
01:29:27,950 --> 01:29:29,080
- Sir...
- We've got work to do.

1483
01:29:46,580 --> 01:29:48,750
Hello.
Ashok, where are you?

1484
01:29:48,870 --> 01:29:50,040
I'm getting late.

1485
01:29:50,120 --> 01:29:51,330
Have you lost your mind, Sulu?

1486
01:29:51,540 --> 01:29:53,500
I'm disconnecting your
calls...that must mean something.

1487
01:29:53,620 --> 01:29:55,250
Ashok, I must get to work today.

1488
01:29:55,370 --> 01:29:57,040
We have a film star
coming over to the studio.

1489
01:29:57,160 --> 01:29:58,700
I told you I've to leave early today.

1490
01:29:58,870 --> 01:30:00,330
Can't you take the day off?

1491
01:30:00,500 --> 01:30:03,790
- Off...but I just...
- Fine, Sulu.

1492
01:30:04,160 --> 01:30:06,000
As usual, you know everything.
You've already made up your mind.

1493
01:30:06,080 --> 01:30:07,160
Do as you want.

1494
01:30:09,790 --> 01:30:10,790
Such a playground.

1495
01:30:10,950 --> 01:30:12,000
You've never been to this place,
have you?

1496
01:30:12,080 --> 01:30:13,370
Never. Never.

1497
01:30:13,540 --> 01:30:15,620
Ayushmann, meet Sulu.

1498
01:30:15,700 --> 01:30:17,870
- Sulu...Ayushmann Khurrana.
- Hello.

1499
01:30:18,040 --> 01:30:20,450
- So, you are Sulu.
- Yes.

1500
01:30:20,660 --> 01:30:21,910
Nice to meet you.

1501
01:30:22,750 --> 01:30:25,250
Hello...I'm here to
light up your lives...

1502
01:30:28,540 --> 01:30:30,330
Pranav...come here.

1503
01:30:30,580 --> 01:30:32,660
Pranav...come here.

1504
01:30:33,040 --> 01:30:34,200
- Your son?
- Yeah.

1505
01:30:35,750 --> 01:30:37,290
- Hi, what's up?
- Hi.

1506
01:30:37,660 --> 01:30:39,120
- How old are you?
- 11

1507
01:30:39,290 --> 01:30:40,120
Same here.

1508
01:30:48,660 --> 01:30:49,330
Hello.

1509
01:30:49,620 --> 01:30:50,750
Hello...

1510
01:30:51,910 --> 01:30:52,870
Hello...

1511
01:30:53,950 --> 01:30:56,330
Who wants to talk to Sulu?

1512
01:30:57,120 --> 01:30:58,290
Hello...yeah...

1513
01:30:58,540 --> 01:31:00,750
Sulu, my child...

1514
01:31:00,950 --> 01:31:02,250
He sounds boring,
let's move on to the next.

1515
01:31:02,410 --> 01:31:03,580
No...let's listen.

1516
01:31:04,330 --> 01:31:07,120
You have a beautiful voice.

1517
01:31:07,950 --> 01:31:09,000
Thank you.

1518
01:31:09,080 --> 01:31:12,160
Sing an old song for me.

1519
01:31:15,040 --> 01:31:17,200
Do you have a favorite song?

1520
01:31:17,750 --> 01:31:18,870
Well...

1521
01:31:19,120 --> 01:31:22,330
It's "Dil Hai Ki Maanta Nahi".

1522
01:31:22,580 --> 01:31:23,620
Can you sing that one for me?

1523
01:31:24,950 --> 01:31:25,700
Yes...

1524
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:27,790
I'll try.

1525
01:31:28,700 --> 01:31:32,250
- Sing along with me.
- Okay. One minute.

1526
01:31:35,120 --> 01:31:41,040
"The heart doesn't seem to agree."

1527
01:31:41,580 --> 01:31:47,160
"The heart doesn't seem to agree."

1528
01:31:48,410 --> 01:31:50,950
You sing really well.

1529
01:31:53,250 --> 01:31:55,540
My name is Sudhakar Reddy.

1530
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,250
My wife's name was Sulochana.

1531
01:31:58,660 --> 01:31:59,370
Oh...

1532
01:31:59,790 --> 01:32:01,870
And, I would call her Sulu.

1533
01:32:04,040 --> 01:32:06,200
Listening to you,
I got reminded of her.

1534
01:32:06,540 --> 01:32:10,040
She would sing and
laugh just like you.

1535
01:32:12,080 --> 01:32:14,700
What did your wife call you?

1536
01:32:14,910 --> 01:32:15,870
Sudha.

1537
01:32:19,450 --> 01:32:20,830
So Sudha...

1538
01:32:23,200 --> 01:32:26,790
...your Sulu would be remembering you.

1539
01:32:29,700 --> 01:32:31,450
And she would be missing you too.

1540
01:32:34,660 --> 01:32:38,000
Take your pills on time,
and don't forget to call me.

1541
01:32:38,540 --> 01:32:39,540
I will...

1542
01:32:39,830 --> 01:32:40,950
Promise?

1543
01:32:41,200 --> 01:32:42,410
Yes, promise.

1544
01:32:42,750 --> 01:32:45,450
Okay, bye.

1545
01:32:45,870 --> 01:32:48,200
Thank you, thank you, Sulu.
God bless you.

1546
01:32:48,290 --> 01:32:49,870
Thank you. Goodnight.

1547
01:33:00,750 --> 01:33:02,450
Would you mind giving me an autograph?

1548
01:33:05,950 --> 01:33:06,870
Go for it.

1549
01:33:14,870 --> 01:33:19,910
"The heart doesn't seem to agree."

1550
01:33:20,700 --> 01:33:27,040
"The heart doesn't seem to agree."

1551
01:33:27,700 --> 01:33:34,540
"Doesn't know that
the path of love..."

1552
01:33:34,830 --> 01:33:37,910
...is never easy!"

1553
01:33:42,290 --> 01:33:44,250
Daddy, last night was so much fun.

1554
01:33:44,870 --> 01:33:46,580
Look at this.
Mummy's office.

1555
01:33:47,290 --> 01:33:49,000
And Ayushmann uncle
wears such a nice deo...

1556
01:33:49,080 --> 01:33:50,410
Top of the world.

1557
01:33:50,660 --> 01:33:52,080
These film stars...

1558
01:33:52,410 --> 01:33:53,870
They hardly take a bath.

1559
01:33:54,040 --> 01:33:54,950
No dad.

1560
01:33:57,620 --> 01:33:59,330
Sulu, this is nice.

1561
01:34:00,830 --> 01:34:01,750
Very good.

1562
01:34:02,790 --> 01:34:03,700
Great.

1563
01:34:07,040 --> 01:34:09,000
Pranav, did you drink your milk?

1564
01:34:09,410 --> 01:34:10,660
Go and drink your milk.

1565
01:34:11,080 --> 01:34:12,370
Or you'll complain later.

1566
01:34:12,540 --> 01:34:15,080
- Fine, I am going. Just chill.
- Chill?

1567
01:34:15,290 --> 01:34:18,870
Pranav, mom's completely
changed after meeting a film star.

1568
01:34:20,160 --> 01:34:20,950
Great.

1569
01:34:21,200 --> 01:34:24,660
Pranav, tell your dad
that mom gets angry too.

1570
01:34:26,580 --> 01:34:29,620
- Then let me see it.
- You first.

1571
01:34:30,200 --> 01:34:32,200
- I don't get angry.
- I do.

1572
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:46,200
Very nice.

1573
01:34:46,580 --> 01:34:48,500
Chetan, what are you doing?

1574
01:34:48,750 --> 01:34:50,080
Here comes the wimp.

1575
01:34:50,160 --> 01:34:51,950
Pranav, come on.

1576
01:34:52,330 --> 01:34:53,540
Come on, buddy.

1577
01:35:00,120 --> 01:35:01,080
What?

1578
01:35:01,250 --> 01:35:03,660
Do you want to see?
Only 10 rupees.

1579
01:35:06,330 --> 01:35:07,910
I told you...he's a wimp.

1580
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:08,910
Wimp!

1581
01:35:09,120 --> 01:35:11,120
Where did you get the phone?

1582
01:35:11,290 --> 01:35:12,790
Where did you get the phone?

1583
01:35:12,870 --> 01:35:14,120
I won't tell you.

1584
01:35:14,370 --> 01:35:15,500
I'll tell ma'am.

1585
01:35:16,540 --> 01:35:18,250
Then I'll tell her too...

1586
01:35:19,620 --> 01:35:20,870
...about the DVD.

1587
01:35:21,080 --> 01:35:23,830
- Wimp!
- Wimp!

1588
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:25,700
- Chetan, let's go.
- Wait.

1589
01:35:25,910 --> 01:35:28,250
- Chetan, let's go.
- I want to see too.

1590
01:35:28,450 --> 01:35:31,370
- Wimp!
- Get lost.

1591
01:35:31,450 --> 01:35:33,450
- Wimp!
- Get lost.

1592
01:35:33,660 --> 01:35:34,750
Wimp!

1593
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,540
Wimp! Wimp!

1594
01:35:38,120 --> 01:35:40,750
Try to get some combination in this.

1595
01:35:41,290 --> 01:35:42,200
No... No...

1596
01:35:44,160 --> 01:35:46,660
Read it...email.

1597
01:35:51,040 --> 01:35:53,580
"We have received..."

1598
01:35:54,120 --> 01:35:56,950
"I regret to inform you that
we will be henceforth terminating...

1599
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,500
...our contract with
Mathuradas & Sons."

1600
01:36:03,080 --> 01:36:05,330
This order was worth 1.5 million.

1601
01:36:05,910 --> 01:36:07,370
Do you know what that's worth?

1602
01:36:09,330 --> 01:36:11,080
How many zeroes in 1.5 million?

1603
01:36:12,540 --> 01:36:14,080
Let's go out and talk.

1604
01:36:14,330 --> 01:36:16,000
Why? Do you feel
embarrassed to talk here?

1605
01:36:16,080 --> 01:36:17,540
Are you feeling embarrassed?

1606
01:36:17,910 --> 01:36:20,000
No. This wasn't my order.

1607
01:36:20,040 --> 01:36:21,250
Am I lying?

1608
01:36:25,870 --> 01:36:27,250
What are you staring at?

1609
01:36:28,790 --> 01:36:30,000
Eyes down.

1610
01:36:31,910 --> 01:36:34,040
Eyes down I said.

1611
01:36:38,830 --> 01:36:41,700
This is what you've been
doing for the last 12 years, right?

1612
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:44,330
Nincompoop.

1613
01:37:10,580 --> 01:37:11,620
What happened?

1614
01:37:14,700 --> 01:37:16,450
- Did I scare you?
- No.

1615
01:37:16,660 --> 01:37:19,620
Now listen to your
Sulu's favourite song.

1616
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:36,750
Chetan.

1617
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:49,000
Hello, Sulu.

1618
01:37:49,580 --> 01:37:50,790
I am Kadam.

1619
01:37:51,120 --> 01:37:53,580
I've been listening to
your show for the last 10 days.

1620
01:37:53,830 --> 01:37:58,200
Your voice is so cool,
that it feels like winters...

1621
01:37:58,870 --> 01:38:00,080
What do I do?

1622
01:38:01,370 --> 01:38:03,080
Kadam, my advice is...

1623
01:38:03,370 --> 01:38:08,410
...wear a sweater before
you dial my number next time.

1624
01:38:08,750 --> 01:38:10,750
Or else you'll catch a cold!

1625
01:38:11,120 --> 01:38:14,790
You're at it again.
Sweet talking to that Sulu.

1626
01:38:14,870 --> 01:38:16,330
Sulu...hang up!

1627
01:38:16,410 --> 01:38:19,290
You and your 'hello...'

1628
01:38:19,910 --> 01:38:20,870
- Sulu.
- Yes.

1629
01:38:21,910 --> 01:38:23,620
My shirt is all wrinkled.
Hurry up.

1630
01:38:24,080 --> 01:38:25,040
I am hurrying.

1631
01:38:26,250 --> 01:38:29,540
Don't call me a wimp!

1632
01:38:30,080 --> 01:38:31,870
Don't call me a wimp!

1633
01:39:10,870 --> 01:39:13,700
What did I tell you?
What did I tell you?

1634
01:39:14,120 --> 01:39:17,000
Go over to the other
office and get the fabric.

1635
01:39:17,540 --> 01:39:19,830
Did you get it?
Do I have to say it again?

1636
01:39:25,200 --> 01:39:28,120
I...Love...You!

1637
01:39:36,620 --> 01:39:39,250
'The customer you're
calling is unavailable.

1638
01:39:39,370 --> 01:39:40,700
'You can now...'

1639
01:39:43,700 --> 01:39:48,250
'The customer you're
calling is unavailable.'

1640
01:39:58,660 --> 01:40:01,290
'The customer you're
calling is unavailable.

1641
01:40:01,370 --> 01:40:03,120
You can now leave a voice message.'

1642
01:40:10,250 --> 01:40:14,330
"I've brought some wonderful tales."

1643
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:18,660
"You've got to listen... o boy."

1644
01:40:19,620 --> 01:40:21,750
"I can create waves in the heart."

1645
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:23,950
"And drive you crazy."

1646
01:40:24,250 --> 01:40:26,330
"Steal the pearl from the ocean..."

1647
01:40:26,540 --> 01:40:28,830
"...and the light from the lamp."

1648
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:31,080
"I can start a fire with stones..."

1649
01:40:31,250 --> 01:40:33,120
"...and steal the night away."

1650
01:40:33,290 --> 01:40:37,040
"Yes...steal the night..."

1651
01:40:38,250 --> 01:40:42,000
"I know the secret you're hiding."

1652
01:40:42,950 --> 01:40:46,450
"I know the secret you're hiding."

1653
01:40:47,540 --> 01:40:51,040
"They call me Hawa Hawai."

1654
01:40:52,080 --> 01:40:54,250
- "Hawa Hawai."
- "Hawa Hawai."

1655
01:40:54,580 --> 01:40:56,580
- "Hawa Hawai."
- "Hawa Hawai."

1656
01:40:56,870 --> 01:40:59,700
"Hawa Hawai."

1657
01:41:22,580 --> 01:41:26,040
"Because I've been blessed
with a face like this."

1658
01:41:27,200 --> 01:41:31,120
"Because I've been blessed
with a face like this."

1659
01:41:31,750 --> 01:41:35,250
"They call me Hawa Hawai."

1660
01:41:48,160 --> 01:41:50,250
What's up, Mr. Ashok?

1661
01:41:52,250 --> 01:41:53,250
What's that?

1662
01:41:53,910 --> 01:41:56,000
It's what everyone
keeps saying at the office.

1663
01:41:56,160 --> 01:41:59,700
"What's up... Chill...

1664
01:42:00,080 --> 01:42:01,080
Dude...

1665
01:42:02,080 --> 01:42:02,870
Bro.

1666
01:42:03,330 --> 01:42:04,750
You know what happened yesterday?

1667
01:42:04,830 --> 01:42:06,000
Sulochana...

1668
01:42:06,830 --> 01:42:08,870
I don't want to know what happened.

1669
01:42:12,080 --> 01:42:13,120
Are you angry?

1670
01:42:15,120 --> 01:42:16,620
I am not angry.

1671
01:42:18,250 --> 01:42:24,000
Hello... Call me,
I will solve all your problems...

1672
01:42:24,080 --> 01:42:25,870
But first get up, you're getting late.

1673
01:42:25,950 --> 01:42:26,620
Pranav!

1674
01:42:26,700 --> 01:42:28,160
- Sulochana.
- Yes.

1675
01:42:32,500 --> 01:42:34,290
I am planning to quit my job.

1676
01:42:37,540 --> 01:42:38,950
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

1677
01:42:39,290 --> 01:42:41,790
Do you have the time
to listen to anyone else?

1678
01:42:42,580 --> 01:42:43,330
"Hello..."

1679
01:42:43,540 --> 01:42:47,120
Your life is all about Maria madam.

1680
01:42:48,660 --> 01:42:52,790
Did you come home at all last night?

1681
01:42:53,330 --> 01:42:55,040
It was Maria madam's birthday.

1682
01:42:55,410 --> 01:42:59,120
She insisted, and my phone's
battery was completely dead.

1683
01:43:00,200 --> 01:43:03,330
You guys must have partied hard then?

1684
01:43:06,660 --> 01:43:07,910
Drinks and all...

1685
01:43:10,950 --> 01:43:12,660
That's the reason I was late...

1686
01:43:13,330 --> 01:43:15,200
The police took us all in...

1687
01:43:15,950 --> 01:43:17,950
Why can't you be serious sometimes?

1688
01:43:19,620 --> 01:43:20,950
Listen...

1689
01:43:21,750 --> 01:43:23,120
Quit your job at Mathuradas.

1690
01:43:23,410 --> 01:43:24,540
You've done enough.

1691
01:43:24,700 --> 01:43:26,660
Soon I'll get a salary
increase as well.

1692
01:43:27,040 --> 01:43:30,040
Then, let's start
something of our own.

1693
01:43:30,580 --> 01:43:31,580
50-50!

1694
01:43:36,450 --> 01:43:39,700
Sulochana, you're the best.

1695
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:37,500
"Sulu's Naughty tales."

1696
01:44:38,450 --> 01:44:40,910
"It was raining that day..."

1697
01:44:41,250 --> 01:44:43,950
"...and Sulu came home
completely drenched."

1698
01:44:44,200 --> 01:44:45,580
"When she got home, she noticed

1699
01:44:45,660 --> 01:44:48,040
that her husband was
waiting for her at home."

1700
01:44:49,450 --> 01:44:54,200
"Seeing Sulu drenched,
her husband got ideas."

1701
01:44:56,080 --> 01:44:58,870
"Seeing her husband desperate,
Sulu couldn't control her laughter."

1702
01:44:58,950 --> 01:45:03,660
"Sulu started teasing her husband
and walked towards him slowly."

1703
01:45:03,750 --> 01:45:08,620
"Sulu got in the mood,
her husband got in the mood."

1704
01:45:16,200 --> 01:45:20,040
Zoo... zoo...
zoobie... zoobie... zoobie.

1705
01:45:20,450 --> 01:45:24,160
Hey... hey zoobie... zoobie... zoobie.

1706
01:45:25,290 --> 01:45:30,200
Zoobie... Zoobie... Zoobie...

1707
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:36,500
O heart, keep singing...Zoo...
zoo... zoobie... zoobie... zoobie.

1708
01:45:36,580 --> 01:45:41,000
...having fun all the way and singing...
Zoo... zoo... zoobie... zoobie... zoobie.

1709
01:45:41,120 --> 01:45:43,160
What?
What is all this?

1710
01:45:44,700 --> 01:45:45,870
Where's Pranav?

1711
01:45:46,330 --> 01:45:48,790
Over at Siddhu's place,
I sent him there.

1712
01:45:49,830 --> 01:45:51,950
How do you like your gift?

1713
01:45:52,910 --> 01:45:53,660
What?

1714
01:45:55,160 --> 01:45:56,450
Don't you see it?

1715
01:45:58,620 --> 01:46:00,950
Have you ever seen me wear red?

1716
01:46:02,790 --> 01:46:04,000
And this?

1717
01:46:05,370 --> 01:46:06,870
What will I do with that, Sulu?

1718
01:46:08,410 --> 01:46:10,950
You should ask before
spending recklessly.

1719
01:46:11,330 --> 01:46:13,950
Here...I'll go take a shower.

1720
01:46:30,120 --> 01:46:31,830
Sulu, what are you doing?

1721
01:46:32,200 --> 01:46:33,620
And what are you doing, Ashok?

1722
01:46:34,200 --> 01:46:35,500
Taking a shower.

1723
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:37,000
For 20 minutes?

1724
01:46:37,250 --> 01:46:38,410
Yes, I am.

1725
01:46:39,410 --> 01:46:41,950
Ashok, it's my first salary.

1726
01:46:42,700 --> 01:46:45,080
And, I bought a Kurta for you.

1727
01:46:45,200 --> 01:46:46,500
Have I ever worn red?

1728
01:46:46,620 --> 01:46:48,580
Then let's get it exchanged, Ashok.

1729
01:46:50,080 --> 01:46:52,250
- Green, blue...
- I don't want to.

1730
01:46:52,410 --> 01:46:54,040
What about the television?

1731
01:46:56,410 --> 01:46:58,120
I've already chosen one.

1732
01:47:01,200 --> 01:47:02,120
Great, Sulu.

1733
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:05,080
You're working now.
You're earning.

1734
01:47:05,290 --> 01:47:07,500
Do what you want.

1735
01:47:24,410 --> 01:47:25,410
Ashok.

1736
01:47:31,250 --> 01:47:34,250
It is Sunday tomorrow.
Let's go out.

1737
01:47:34,910 --> 01:47:36,450
It's been really long.

1738
01:47:41,120 --> 01:47:44,200
I even have a gift voucher.

1739
01:47:44,500 --> 01:47:45,540
Say something, Ashok.

1740
01:47:56,200 --> 01:47:59,370
"Sulu's Naughty tales."

1741
01:48:00,330 --> 01:48:03,250
"It was raining that day..."

1742
01:48:03,330 --> 01:48:06,120
"...and Sulu came home
completely drenched."

1743
01:48:06,450 --> 01:48:07,620
"When she got home, she noticed

1744
01:48:07,790 --> 01:48:10,040
that her husband was
waiting for her at home."

1745
01:48:11,830 --> 01:48:15,870
- I don't... - "Seeing Sulu drenched,
her husband got ideas."

1746
01:48:16,250 --> 01:48:17,750
I don't... know?

1747
01:48:18,330 --> 01:48:21,290
"Seeing her husband desperate,
Sulu couldn't control her laughter."

1748
01:48:21,370 --> 01:48:23,830
"Sulu started teasing her husband
and walked towards him slowly."

1749
01:48:26,370 --> 01:48:27,370
I don't...

1750
01:48:28,540 --> 01:48:29,330
I...

1751
01:48:31,250 --> 01:48:32,290
Ashok.

1752
01:48:34,500 --> 01:48:35,410
Ashok.

1753
01:48:46,790 --> 01:48:52,290
"This world is woven
by strange threads."

1754
01:48:56,160 --> 01:49:01,950
"This world is woven
by strange threads."

1755
01:49:03,040 --> 01:49:08,660
"These threads are a mixed
bag of happiness and sorrow."

1756
01:49:09,620 --> 01:49:16,290
"We have sewn our patches
with these threads."

1757
01:49:16,580 --> 01:49:23,330
"We have sewn our patches
with these threads."

1758
01:49:26,250 --> 01:49:31,870
"This world is woven
by strange threads."

1759
01:49:33,250 --> 01:49:39,290
"These threads are a mixed
bag of happiness and sorrow."

1760
01:49:39,790 --> 01:49:46,450
"We have sewn our patches
with these threads."

1761
01:49:46,790 --> 01:49:53,450
"We have sewn our patches
with these threads."

1762
01:49:56,450 --> 01:50:01,500
"While you found the way,
I had a wall."

1763
01:50:03,370 --> 01:50:09,370
"While you found the way,
I had a wall."

1764
01:50:10,040 --> 01:50:15,290
"But even on those
wall I created a garden."

1765
01:50:17,290 --> 01:50:22,620
"When you came back in the evening,
the buds has wilted."

1766
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:29,830
"When you came back in the evening,
the buds has wilted."

1767
01:50:30,910 --> 01:50:36,950
"We have sewn our patches
with these threads."

1768
01:50:37,870 --> 01:50:42,410
"We have sewn our patches
with these threads."

1769
01:50:44,250 --> 01:50:45,250
Sulu.

1770
01:50:46,540 --> 01:50:49,160
- Have you seen my phone?
- No.

1771
01:50:49,410 --> 01:50:51,370
Did you check your pant pockets?

1772
01:50:54,250 --> 01:50:55,290
Check on the shelf?

1773
01:51:00,290 --> 01:51:03,160
It had to happen today...

1774
01:51:03,580 --> 01:51:05,450
Did you leave it in the car?

1775
01:51:05,750 --> 01:51:06,620
Sulu...

1776
01:51:07,080 --> 01:51:09,870
Call me at the office if
you find my phone. I am leaving.

1777
01:51:10,120 --> 01:51:12,040
- Okay. - What am I going
to do about my interview?!

1778
01:51:36,250 --> 01:51:37,250
Hello.

1779
01:52:05,370 --> 01:52:07,620
Is this your mobile, Mr. Ashok Dubey?

1780
01:52:08,250 --> 01:52:09,250
Yes, sir.

1781
01:52:13,250 --> 01:52:14,620
Is this your signature?

1782
01:52:21,870 --> 01:52:22,830
You...

1783
01:52:23,160 --> 01:52:26,540
Mrs. Ashok!
Please don't misbehave in my office.

1784
01:52:26,750 --> 01:52:27,330
Please.

1785
01:52:29,500 --> 01:52:30,330
No, sir.

1786
01:52:33,750 --> 01:52:36,830
Do you all live in the same house?

1787
01:52:40,250 --> 01:52:42,540
Your son's turned into a businessman.

1788
01:52:42,830 --> 01:52:44,080
Congratulations.

1789
01:52:46,870 --> 01:52:49,450
First, he smuggled
magazines into the school.

1790
01:52:49,540 --> 01:52:50,830
His friend and he.

1791
01:52:51,830 --> 01:52:53,370
Then DVDs.

1792
01:52:54,250 --> 01:52:55,580
And now a mobile phone

1793
01:52:56,620 --> 01:52:59,700
20 rupees per viewing.

1794
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:05,160
Where does he learn
all this from? Where?

1795
01:53:07,250 --> 01:53:08,250
Sir...

1796
01:53:10,370 --> 01:53:12,000
You'll say school.

1797
01:53:12,750 --> 01:53:16,790
Okay, I will take
the responsibility...

1798
01:53:17,250 --> 01:53:20,000
...and I will pay a price for it also.

1799
01:53:22,870 --> 01:53:25,160
- He's suspended.
- No, no, sir...

1800
01:53:25,250 --> 01:53:26,750
Please, sir...

1801
01:53:27,200 --> 01:53:29,160
I'll make sure this never happens.

1802
01:53:30,750 --> 01:53:32,160
I swear...

1803
01:53:33,450 --> 01:53:35,500
- You must, Mr. Ashok.
- Please, sir.

1804
01:53:37,040 --> 01:53:39,160
I have never ever
seen a case like this.

1805
01:53:39,330 --> 01:53:42,790
Sir...last chance.

1806
01:53:43,040 --> 01:53:46,330
I guarantee it'll never happen.

1807
01:53:47,250 --> 01:53:50,620
Radio: 'It's a beautiful day.
Everything looks so wonderful today.

1808
01:53:50,870 --> 01:53:55,500
Turn off the radio.
I said turn it off.

1809
01:53:55,910 --> 01:53:59,500
Why are you yelling?
Fine, I'll turn it off.

1810
01:54:14,290 --> 01:54:15,750
Why did you touch my phone?

1811
01:54:17,500 --> 01:54:18,540
Why did you touch my phone?

1812
01:54:18,790 --> 01:54:19,950
I won't do it again.

1813
01:54:20,200 --> 01:54:21,330
Why did you touch my phone?

1814
01:54:21,500 --> 01:54:22,450
Sorry.

1815
01:54:23,250 --> 01:54:24,370
So now you're stealing?

1816
01:54:24,620 --> 01:54:26,250
Who taught you to steal?

1817
01:54:26,290 --> 01:54:27,700
Who taught you?

1818
01:54:27,830 --> 01:54:31,290
We gave you everything, didn't we?

1819
01:54:31,410 --> 01:54:32,290
Papa, please.

1820
01:54:32,370 --> 01:54:34,540
Who taught you this?
Who is Chetan?

1821
01:54:34,830 --> 01:54:37,910
Dady, please. Sorry.

1822
01:54:38,290 --> 01:54:40,950
You've been suspended from school,
do you realize that?

1823
01:54:42,290 --> 01:54:44,040
How will I face people?

1824
01:54:45,250 --> 01:54:48,250
- Why did you steal the phone?
- Sorry, daddy.

1825
01:54:48,660 --> 01:54:51,870
Tell me what you want.
I'll bring it for you.

1826
01:54:52,750 --> 01:54:54,290
Tell me what you want.

1827
01:54:55,500 --> 01:54:57,040
Do you hear what I am saying?

1828
01:54:57,290 --> 01:54:59,200
What do you want?

1829
01:55:15,370 --> 01:55:17,450
What are you going to do now?
Huh, Pranav?

1830
01:55:17,750 --> 01:55:21,040
- I haven't even had lunch.
- Neither have I, sister.

1831
01:55:21,250 --> 01:55:25,250
He'll sell eggs, what else?

1832
01:55:35,450 --> 01:55:41,290
- Where does she keep her cups?
- Check if there are any biscuits.

1833
01:55:41,950 --> 01:55:42,290
I'll get it.

1834
01:55:42,370 --> 01:55:45,370
Nobody cares about
anything around here.

1835
01:55:46,660 --> 01:55:48,370
Are you going to say something?

1836
01:55:50,080 --> 01:55:54,540
I slog all day and come home to this.

1837
01:55:54,830 --> 01:55:58,080
Ashok had called...and we
left our office in the middle.

1838
01:55:58,450 --> 01:55:59,450
Very good.

1839
01:56:00,290 --> 01:56:01,160
That's it?

1840
01:56:08,290 --> 01:56:10,290
- Don't you want tea?
- No, I don't.

1841
01:56:10,370 --> 01:56:12,750
- Look at her attitude!
- Forget it, sister.

1842
01:56:12,870 --> 01:56:14,750
I had an interview today.

1843
01:56:14,950 --> 01:56:16,290
How did it go?

1844
01:56:16,370 --> 01:56:19,910
I couldn't go for it,
the address was in the phone.

1845
01:56:21,290 --> 01:56:25,750
Daddy, you were right
about this colony.

1846
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:29,910
We should move out of here.

1847
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:31,580
Aunty I don't want to go.

1848
01:56:31,660 --> 01:56:33,370
Ashok she isn't saying a thing.

1849
01:56:33,450 --> 01:56:35,790
Take him away.
Pranav.

1850
01:56:36,200 --> 01:56:37,950
Take your bag and go.

1851
01:56:38,120 --> 01:56:39,450
- I don't want to go, please.
- Shut up.

1852
01:56:39,540 --> 01:56:40,790
- What did I say?
- No dady.

1853
01:56:40,950 --> 01:56:42,250
- No, you deserve this.
- Sorry dady.

1854
01:56:42,290 --> 01:56:44,330
- Take your bag and go.
- I won't go.

1855
01:56:44,450 --> 01:56:46,000
Take him away. Take him away.

1856
01:56:46,120 --> 01:56:47,160
No one's going anywhere.

1857
01:56:47,250 --> 01:56:48,040
- Pranav.
- Mom...

1858
01:56:48,160 --> 01:56:50,250
Sulu, I've decided.
He's going with them.

1859
01:56:50,330 --> 01:56:52,250
Why?
You were supposed to take care of him.

1860
01:56:52,450 --> 01:56:53,370
Remember what you said at his school.

1861
01:56:53,450 --> 01:56:55,160
I'll personally make sure this
doesn't happen again. Then do it!

1862
01:56:55,250 --> 01:56:57,290
- Stop talking nonsense, Sulu.
- But you can, right.

1863
01:56:57,410 --> 01:56:59,370
I don't charge money for it.

1864
01:56:59,790 --> 01:57:01,910
Sulu, resign today.

1865
01:57:02,040 --> 01:57:03,790
He'll shape up if he
lives with us for a few days.

1866
01:57:03,870 --> 01:57:05,160
No one's going anywhere.

1867
01:57:05,250 --> 01:57:07,160
My car will be arriving, I am going.

1868
01:57:07,250 --> 01:57:09,250
Are you serious?
You're going to work today.

1869
01:57:09,290 --> 01:57:11,450
Forget it.
Stay at home and pay attention to him.

1870
01:57:11,750 --> 01:57:13,620
What do you mean by pay attention?
You mean to say that I don't.

1871
01:57:13,750 --> 01:57:15,250
Then why is it happening?

1872
01:57:15,290 --> 01:57:17,700
You mean I taught him this? Huh?

1873
01:57:17,950 --> 01:57:19,830
- We don't even have a TV at home.
- What about the TV?

1874
01:57:19,910 --> 01:57:21,500
- Leave it, Ashok.
- Leave what?

1875
01:57:21,580 --> 01:57:24,700
Go on...get some more pictures
clicked with film stars.

1876
01:57:25,250 --> 01:57:25,870
That's all he's going to learn.

1877
01:57:25,950 --> 01:57:27,950
Sulu, you must quit your job first!

1878
01:57:29,950 --> 01:57:31,910
- Why should I quit?
- Please, don't.

1879
01:57:32,080 --> 01:57:33,410
Go on...go to your job.

1880
01:57:33,620 --> 01:57:35,580
There's no telling
what he'll do in future.

1881
01:57:35,750 --> 01:57:38,330
- Quiet, Ashok.
- Who are you telling to shut up? Huh?

1882
01:57:38,410 --> 01:57:40,370
Just a minute, Ashok.
What is all this argument...

1883
01:57:40,450 --> 01:57:41,080
No, daddy.

1884
01:57:41,200 --> 01:57:43,040
Even at school, he was saying,
"I'll take care going forward."

1885
01:57:43,120 --> 01:57:44,250
You think I don't
pay attention to him?

1886
01:57:44,330 --> 01:57:45,580
You and your late night show.

1887
01:57:45,830 --> 01:57:46,950
I told you there will be problems.

1888
01:57:47,080 --> 01:57:48,910
There are no problems in my home.

1889
01:57:49,080 --> 01:57:50,830
No, no, there is no problem at home.

1890
01:57:50,910 --> 01:57:53,750
All the problems started
since you joined that cheap job.

1891
01:57:54,120 --> 01:57:55,080
Cheap?

1892
01:57:55,750 --> 01:57:58,080
- Take him away.
- Don't touch him.

1893
01:57:58,200 --> 01:57:59,250
Pranav, go inside.

1894
01:57:59,290 --> 01:58:01,580
I'll talk to your boss... Radio Show.

1895
01:58:01,750 --> 01:58:03,370
I told you not to take
up this late night show.

1896
01:58:03,450 --> 01:58:04,450
He's fast asleep when I leave...

1897
01:58:04,540 --> 01:58:06,250
...what has my job got
to do anything with him?

1898
01:58:06,290 --> 01:58:08,290
First, everyone wanted
me to take up a job...

1899
01:58:08,370 --> 01:58:10,540
...and now, you all want me to quit.

1900
01:58:10,750 --> 01:58:13,160
No one's dead here.
This is my home, I'll take care of it.

1901
01:58:13,250 --> 01:58:14,500
Sulu, think about it.

1902
01:58:14,620 --> 01:58:17,700
- It's for your own well being.
- For my well being?

1903
01:58:17,830 --> 01:58:19,580
Thank you very much, daddy.

1904
01:58:19,790 --> 01:58:22,250
You always support them,
no one's with me.

1905
01:58:22,290 --> 01:58:25,330
Hey drama queen, pick up
the phone and resign right now.

1906
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:27,540
Get lost.

1907
01:58:27,830 --> 01:58:28,660
Sulu.

1908
01:59:07,250 --> 01:59:09,950
- You didn't carry food today?
- Huh.

1909
01:59:10,160 --> 01:59:11,410
No lunchbox...

1910
01:59:21,160 --> 01:59:24,370
People send anything
in the name of a joke.

1911
01:59:24,790 --> 01:59:25,750
Crazy.

1912
01:59:35,450 --> 01:59:37,040
Shall we begin?

1913
01:59:40,330 --> 01:59:41,500
Come on.

1914
02:00:00,410 --> 02:00:01,370
All well?

1915
02:00:13,290 --> 02:00:15,330
Sulu. Sulu.

1916
02:00:15,540 --> 02:00:16,410
Pallavi.

1917
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:18,910
Sulu.

1918
02:00:32,250 --> 02:00:33,160
Yeah, Ashok.

1919
02:00:36,250 --> 02:00:37,160
Huh...?

1920
02:00:40,660 --> 02:00:41,700
What?

1921
02:00:42,450 --> 02:00:43,830
Ashok.

1922
02:00:45,660 --> 02:00:48,200
- Where were you?
- I was at the gate, sir.

1923
02:00:48,620 --> 02:00:51,700
- And you didn't see, Pranav?
- No. He didn't leave.

1924
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:53,370
Where did he go now?

1925
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:54,660
Ashok?

1926
02:00:58,950 --> 02:01:00,330
Ashok, what happened?

1927
02:01:01,290 --> 02:01:03,040
I can't find Pranav anywhere.

1928
02:01:04,200 --> 02:01:05,410
He must be around somewhere.

1929
02:01:05,660 --> 02:01:07,700
- Ashok, come here.
- I'll look around.

1930
02:01:09,160 --> 02:01:10,080
Pranav.

1931
02:01:11,660 --> 02:01:13,870
Sulu, listen... Listen, dear.

1932
02:01:14,120 --> 02:01:15,120
Pranav.

1933
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:19,620
Please do something, Maria madam.

1934
02:01:20,040 --> 02:01:21,830
My Pranav is missing.

1935
02:01:24,580 --> 02:01:25,750
Pranav!

1936
02:01:27,290 --> 02:01:28,290
Pranav!

1937
02:01:30,950 --> 02:01:31,950
Pranav!

1938
02:01:32,120 --> 02:01:35,950
- What was he wearing?
- Green color shorts.

1939
02:01:36,200 --> 02:01:39,080
- And striped...
- Grey T-shirt.

1940
02:01:39,250 --> 02:01:40,910
- With red and blue stripes...
- Okay.

1941
02:03:36,410 --> 02:03:39,540
"Sorry, daddy...very sorry, daddy."

1942
02:03:39,950 --> 02:03:42,330
"I'll never touch your phone again."

1943
02:03:43,580 --> 02:03:46,540
"Don't scold mom because of me."

1944
02:03:47,450 --> 02:03:48,500
"I am going..."

1945
02:03:49,040 --> 02:03:53,120
"And, everyone calls
me a wimp at school."

1946
02:03:53,540 --> 02:03:54,950
"But I am not a wimp."

1947
02:03:55,080 --> 02:03:58,080
"Dad, I don't want
to go with aunty twins."

1948
02:03:58,250 --> 02:04:00,580
"They always scold mom."

1949
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:02,830
"Please take mom's side."

1950
02:04:03,370 --> 02:04:06,370
"Mom is nice...in fact,
she's very nice."

1951
02:04:06,870 --> 02:04:08,540
"You're nice too.

1952
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:10,200
"I am bad."

1953
02:04:11,540 --> 02:04:13,620
"Sorry daddy, sorry mom."

1954
02:04:24,540 --> 02:04:26,500
Hello. Yes, sir.

1955
02:04:26,580 --> 02:04:29,120
No, no...we got a
small picture of him.

1956
02:04:29,660 --> 02:04:31,160
But the face is clearly visible.

1957
02:04:33,080 --> 02:04:34,200
I'll send it over.

1958
02:04:34,250 --> 02:04:37,250
We have both the pictures.
I'll get it.

1959
02:04:37,330 --> 02:04:39,790
- Do you have a picture of him?
- We do.

1960
02:04:43,830 --> 02:04:46,370
- Sorry, daddy.
- Pranav.

1961
02:04:47,830 --> 02:04:51,040
Pranav. Where were you?

1962
02:04:51,250 --> 02:04:52,500
Sorry, daddy.

1963
02:04:52,790 --> 02:04:55,410
We found him in the classroom
in the morning. He was crying.

1964
02:04:55,870 --> 02:04:58,000
He kept saying, "Please
don't expel me from school"

1965
02:05:08,410 --> 02:05:09,870
Sorry, Mom.

1966
02:05:17,290 --> 02:05:19,700
I'm sorry mom.

1967
02:05:21,450 --> 02:05:22,910
Please forgive me.

1968
02:05:23,040 --> 02:05:24,040
Pranav!

1969
02:05:28,500 --> 02:05:30,040
Pranav.

1970
02:05:36,910 --> 02:05:38,910
It's alright.

1971
02:05:39,830 --> 02:05:42,830
Would you have breakfast here
or should I pack something for you?

1972
02:05:44,750 --> 02:05:46,080
No, we'll leave.

1973
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:01,910
Yes, sir.
I promise you, I'll get it done.

1974
02:06:02,120 --> 02:06:03,950
Okay. I'll call you right back.

1975
02:06:07,910 --> 02:06:09,540
Yes, Sulu. Tell me.

1976
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:16,290
I can't do this anymore, Maria madam.

1977
02:06:18,700 --> 02:06:19,620
Sorry...

1978
02:06:21,410 --> 02:06:24,790
I knew I said it right here...

1979
02:06:27,580 --> 02:06:30,500
"I can be an RJ... I can."

1980
02:06:33,500 --> 02:06:35,910
But, I can't continue any longer.

1981
02:06:42,330 --> 02:06:44,330
You've done so much for me.

1982
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:46,870
Sorry...

1983
02:06:47,370 --> 02:06:48,620
No, thank you.

1984
02:06:52,620 --> 02:06:54,540
You really are a champion.

1985
02:07:00,120 --> 02:07:02,080
I never said this...

1986
02:07:02,580 --> 02:07:06,500
... but really loved the perfume
you were wearing when we first met.

1987
02:07:13,500 --> 02:07:17,200
You can yell at me if you like,
Maria madam.

1988
02:07:18,250 --> 02:07:19,200
It's alright.

1989
02:07:23,950 --> 02:07:27,660
You guys never visited my home right?

1990
02:07:28,950 --> 02:07:32,290
My mistake,
I should've invited you guys over.

1991
02:07:33,370 --> 02:07:34,370
But when?

1992
02:07:36,750 --> 02:07:40,120
But, you can still
come over for dinner.

1993
02:07:40,750 --> 02:07:44,950
And Pankaj,
booze not allowed in my home.

1994
02:07:50,160 --> 02:07:52,910
Honestly speaking Maria madam,
I was happy.

1995
02:07:53,660 --> 02:07:54,950
Carefree...

1996
02:07:56,950 --> 02:08:01,290
I always wanted a job like this...

1997
02:08:02,120 --> 02:08:04,700
...but everything happened too fast.

1998
02:08:07,830 --> 02:08:09,290
But, I had fun.

1999
02:08:11,950 --> 02:08:16,370
I enjoy everything I do.

2000
02:08:22,620 --> 02:08:26,870
But now... something has gone wrong.

2001
02:08:31,950 --> 02:08:33,540
It's just not working out for me.

2002
02:08:38,250 --> 02:08:42,700
All my life I kept assuring
myself that I can do anything

2003
02:08:43,750 --> 02:08:47,620
Mimicking Sridevi's voice,
Bala Subramaniam's song...

2004
02:08:48,410 --> 02:08:53,620
...friendship with Bhagyashree, Chit
fund business, lemon and spoon race.

2005
02:08:54,950 --> 02:08:56,540
You know, Maria Madam...

2006
02:08:57,620 --> 02:09:03,080
...I never dropped the lemon
in the lemon-and-spoon race.

2007
02:09:08,580 --> 02:09:12,620
I never bothered
about winning or losing.

2008
02:09:13,660 --> 02:09:15,370
But the lemon was intact.

2009
02:09:20,910 --> 02:09:28,500
But amidst everything...I
missed out on my home.

2010
02:09:30,870 --> 02:09:33,830
My responsibilities went for a toss.

2011
02:09:36,580 --> 02:09:37,500
Sorry.

2012
02:09:39,250 --> 02:09:41,830
You trusted me so much, sorry.

2013
02:09:46,250 --> 02:09:47,830
You're happy, aren't you? That's it.

2014
02:09:51,290 --> 02:09:53,500
And, you can do my show now.

2015
02:09:54,830 --> 02:09:56,410
I'll listen to it every day...

2016
02:09:56,750 --> 02:09:57,830
I'll call too...

2017
02:09:59,870 --> 02:10:00,870
Don't go...

2018
02:10:02,080 --> 02:10:05,000
You...you're the best.

2019
02:10:05,580 --> 02:10:07,500
You're cut out for this space.

2020
02:10:08,120 --> 02:10:09,160
Say something, Maria.

2021
02:10:09,370 --> 02:10:11,370
It's okay Panky, it's fine.

2022
02:10:12,450 --> 02:10:13,500
All good.

2023
02:10:20,910 --> 02:10:21,870
Thank you.

2024
02:10:24,120 --> 02:10:25,160
Take care.

2025
02:10:31,830 --> 02:10:32,540
Bye.

2026
02:10:33,160 --> 02:10:34,120
Listen.

2027
02:10:34,950 --> 02:10:38,950
Before you leave,
say 'Hello' in your style...

2028
02:10:52,950 --> 02:10:54,290
Oh man.

2029
02:10:58,660 --> 02:10:59,500
Didn't you see the email?

2030
02:10:59,580 --> 02:11:01,160
My curry is the best in the world!

2031
02:11:01,250 --> 02:11:03,660
Yeah, because no one survived
after eating your curry.

2032
02:11:03,790 --> 02:11:05,500
I've complained so many times.

2033
02:11:05,620 --> 02:11:06,620
Didn't you read the email?

2034
02:11:06,700 --> 02:11:07,910
My curry is the best.

2035
02:11:08,080 --> 02:11:12,290
You serve rotten food. Get out.

2036
02:11:12,410 --> 02:11:14,200
Then settle my account,
give me my cheque.

2037
02:11:14,370 --> 02:11:15,830
You won't be getting a cheque.

2038
02:11:15,910 --> 02:11:18,120
Who is going to pay
you for rotten food?

2039
02:11:18,250 --> 02:11:19,910
Stop complaining about my food.

2040
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:22,410
- You're not getting any cheque.
- Give me my cheque.

2041
02:11:22,540 --> 02:11:25,370
- What cheque?
- My food is the best.

2042
02:11:25,450 --> 02:11:27,080
- Says who? - How many tiffin
boxes do you need every day?

2043
02:11:27,160 --> 02:11:28,700
It's the best.

2044
02:11:29,540 --> 02:11:31,250
How many tiffin boxes
do you need every day?

2045
02:11:31,370 --> 02:11:33,910
15...
No, 25-30.

2046
02:11:34,160 --> 02:11:37,540
- Just hand over my cheque.
- What for?

2047
02:11:37,660 --> 02:11:39,370
- Daily?
- Yes, ma'am. daily.

2048
02:11:52,330 --> 02:11:54,330
Are you okay, Sulu?
What happened?

2049
02:11:54,700 --> 02:11:59,120
Maria madam, the split
green gram cooks in one whistle.

2050
02:12:00,200 --> 02:12:01,620
There are two varieties
of split red gram.

2051
02:12:01,700 --> 02:12:02,660
Yellow and red.

2052
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:04,290
The yellow ones need two whistles...

2053
02:12:04,410 --> 02:12:05,620
...while the red needs three.

2054
02:12:05,700 --> 02:12:08,160
And for chickpea,
four whistles are compulsory.

2055
02:12:08,290 --> 02:12:12,080
Please...
Because if we don't...

2056
02:12:42,330 --> 02:12:43,750
No, no, no...Sulu.

2057
02:12:44,200 --> 02:12:46,080
No. Idea?

2058
02:12:46,910 --> 02:12:49,410
- Another Idea?
- I can do it, Ashok.

2059
02:12:52,660 --> 02:12:54,910
Honestly, I can do it.

2060
02:12:56,950 --> 02:12:57,910
Get in, I'll tell you.

2061
02:12:58,000 --> 02:12:58,950
- Sulu.
- Huh.

2062
02:12:59,580 --> 02:13:00,410
50-50.

2063
02:13:09,290 --> 02:13:11,330
Hello. Ashok Tiffin Service.

2064
02:13:13,700 --> 02:13:14,950
I can hear now.

2065
02:13:15,120 --> 02:13:17,410
Hello.
Ashok Tiffin Service here.

2066
02:13:17,580 --> 02:13:18,660
And Ashok here.

2067
02:13:21,540 --> 02:13:22,910
Yes. Yes...

2068
02:13:24,620 --> 02:13:25,540
How many Tiffin?

2069
02:13:31,250 --> 02:13:34,120
Sulu, you'll have to drive
yourself to work from tomorrow.

2070
02:13:34,290 --> 02:13:37,000
Otherwise,
our son will flunk his exams.

2071
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:40,410
Ashok, call me if you need anything.

2072
02:13:40,580 --> 02:13:42,660
- From your heart.
- Hello...

2073
02:13:45,750 --> 02:13:46,580
Bye.

2074
02:13:47,160 --> 02:13:50,330
And listen, turn in early today.
Crank up the window.

2075
02:13:50,540 --> 02:13:52,660
You're listening to
Radio Wow and it's 9 pm...

2076
02:13:52,750 --> 02:13:54,080
...and I am signing off.

2077
02:13:54,200 --> 02:13:58,330
Coming up next, to light up your
nights, is your favorite, RJ Sulu.

2078
02:13:59,790 --> 02:14:00,700
Hello...

2079
02:14:01,580 --> 02:14:06,330
I'm here to light up your nights
and make your dreams come alive.

2080
02:14:06,620 --> 02:14:08,790
This is Sulu.

2081
02:14:09,870 --> 02:14:14,120
Call me from your
heart and talk to me.

2082
02:14:14,790 --> 02:14:15,870
Won't you?
