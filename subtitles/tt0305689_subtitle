00:00:54,688 --> 00:00:57,382
JAB JAB PHOOL KHILE

2
00:03:38,054 --> 00:03:42,418
I'm glad your education takes
care of our responsility.

3
00:03:46,053 --> 00:03:48,679
How did you find Kishore?

4
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:53,014
Kishore... aunty's son?

5
00:03:53,387 --> 00:03:57,341
Yes. The son of my partner
the late Kishanchand.

6
00:03:58,086 --> 00:04:00,019
He handles the business
in Darjeeling.

7
00:04:00,354 --> 00:04:02,285
Do you approve of him?
- Approve of him?

8
00:04:05,287 --> 00:04:10,241
"If it is marriage you are
talking about, no way!"

9
00:04:11,352 --> 00:04:15,581
I've yet to decide
if I will marry at all!

10
00:04:17,553 --> 00:04:19,452
I haven't yet thought of what
I will do with my life!

11
00:04:20,588 --> 00:04:27,644
"After the experience of America,
I want to go away to a place... "

12
00:04:28,019 --> 00:04:29,645
where I can escape the
noise and din!

13
00:04:30,053 --> 00:04:32,542
"A place that is peaceful,
quiet and comfortable. "

14
00:04:34,719 --> 00:04:38,550
Which place must I visit?
- To Kashmir.

15
00:04:39,119 --> 00:04:42,177
Wonderful! I'd thought
of Darjeeling.

16
00:04:43,387 --> 00:04:45,353
But Kashmir would be better.

17
00:04:46,252 --> 00:04:50,345
"Are you already sick of me?
- You will join me, too. "

18
00:04:51,053 --> 00:04:57,282
I can't leave the city for a
minute! Ask your Mom instead.

19
00:04:59,052 --> 00:05:04,986
My women's conferences...
I can't even take a massage!

20
00:05:06,018 --> 00:05:09,951
I'm getting fat...
and your dad hates it.

21
00:05:10,353 --> 00:05:11,578
"Eat less, Mom!
- Shut up!"

22
00:05:15,285 --> 00:05:17,479
Will I go all by myself, Daddy?"

23
00:05:17,719 --> 00:05:21,550
"No, dear. Stella will join you.
When do you want to leave?"

24
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,984
"Any day, dad.
- In that case... "

25
00:05:24,185 --> 00:05:26,515
I'll book a house-boat
for you immediately.

26
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:06,351
"Excuse me, madam...
... "God forgive"!"

27
00:06:06,652 --> 00:06:09,278
Where the hell is he?

28
00:06:12,019 --> 00:06:14,950
"Allah Baksh!
- Yes, sir?"

29
00:06:15,185 --> 00:06:19,141
God is kind to you!
You have a guest from Mumbai.

30
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:26,979
Do you like this house-boat?

31
00:06:27,618 --> 00:06:30,244
Very much. But this one...
not that.

32
00:06:33,019 --> 00:06:34,643
Have my lugagge kept
in that houseboat.

33
00:06:38,351 --> 00:06:41,977
It belongs to the crazy Raja!
He will not rent it out!

34
00:06:45,052 --> 00:06:46,416
Do as I say.

35
00:06:50,053 --> 00:06:52,677
But I've got to ask him first.

36
00:07:00,385 --> 00:07:07,340
"You've got it made, Raja!
My lucky boy!"

37
00:07:07,651 --> 00:07:10,516
There's a guest from Bombay who's
flipped for your houseboat!

38
00:07:10,718 --> 00:07:14,674
It's not available.
Go look for another one.

39
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:18,613
Won't you let it out then?
- No!

40
00:07:20,751 --> 00:07:22,273
The madman!

41
00:07:25,219 --> 00:07:27,118
The houseboat is already
booked for someone.

42
00:07:29,284 --> 00:07:32,308
But no one has still arrived...
- No. Not yet.

43
00:07:32,751 --> 00:07:34,980
Tell him that I'm willing
to pay him more money.

44
00:07:37,186 --> 00:07:38,652
I'll have to ask again.

45
00:07:40,019 --> 00:07:45,712
Lucky boy! Let's have a deal!
She'll pay you more money!

46
00:07:46,185 --> 00:07:49,310
"Once I give my word, money
is of no consequence. "

47
00:07:50,352 --> 00:07:52,648
It's not available...
it's already booked.

48
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:57,383
God! He's crazy!

49
00:07:59,252 --> 00:08:00,513
"Accept the offer, brother. "

50
00:08:01,051 --> 00:08:03,517
The guests were to arrive the
day-before and still haven't.

51
00:08:03,718 --> 00:08:05,275
So? Just shut up!

52
00:08:09,184 --> 00:08:11,673
Crazy chap! He says he does
not hanker after money!

53
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:15,713
Where is he? Take me to him.

54
00:08:21,052 --> 00:08:23,711
"Don't harass me, manager!
Else I'll throw you in the seas. "

55
00:08:24,585 --> 00:08:27,609
"Brother...!
- Stop scaring me, sis!"

56
00:08:28,152 --> 00:08:30,278
"It's my houseboat. I will not
let it out, if I don't wish to. "

57
00:08:32,418 --> 00:08:33,349
My God!

58
00:08:44,084 --> 00:08:48,039
"What's the rent of the houseboat?
- Just 500 Rupees, madam. "

59
00:08:48,417 --> 00:08:50,247
I'm willing to pay you
600 Rupees.

60
00:08:51,751 --> 00:08:53,377
Will 700 be all right?

61
00:08:55,352 --> 00:08:59,044
800?
How much do you want?!

62
00:09:00,718 --> 00:09:01,649
500 Rupees, madam. "

63
00:09:02,052 --> 00:09:04,985
What?!
- Yes. Just 500 Rupees.

64
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:08,008
Let me show you the houseboat.
Please come with me.

65
00:09:08,383 --> 00:09:10,406
"Stay here, manager.
I'll be back soon. "

66
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:16,508
"Strange man! If you wanted just
500, why did you refuse me?"

67
00:09:17,052 --> 00:09:18,677
It's not a question of money;
it's principles.

68
00:09:19,052 --> 00:09:21,016
The houseboat was booked by
two guys from South Africa.

69
00:09:21,383 --> 00:09:27,010
So?
- They didn't turn up...

70
00:09:27,251 --> 00:09:28,614
and I let it out to you.

71
00:09:29,051 --> 00:09:30,415
Please come...

72
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:35,140
This is the drawing room.

73
00:09:38,351 --> 00:09:40,249
And this is the library...

74
00:09:41,418 --> 00:09:46,043
"with authors like Tagore,
Shakespeare and Munshi Premchand. "

75
00:09:48,084 --> 00:09:51,311
And that's my audio collection
with albums by...

76
00:09:51,483 --> 00:09:56,213
"Mohammad Rafi, Saigal and
Mr Lata Mangeshkar. "

77
00:09:56,685 --> 00:10:03,446
"There are foreign albums, too.
Including Elvis Presley. "

78
00:10:05,051 --> 00:10:12,676
"You're surprised, aren't you?
Yes. I'm not educated. "

79
00:10:13,382 --> 00:10:18,441
But I hear and use information
I get from educated guests.

80
00:10:21,051 --> 00:10:24,210
"This is the dining room...
it's nice, isn't it?"

81
00:10:27,051 --> 00:10:29,176
And this is the bedroom...

82
00:10:30,051 --> 00:10:34,609
with Kashmir silk bedsheets and
a matress by Dunlop tyres.

83
00:10:35,449 --> 00:10:38,610
Dunlop tyres?!
- Yes. Take a look.

84
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:40,709
You mean the Dunlop pillow!

85
00:10:45,084 --> 00:10:47,516
It's beautiful.
- Thank you.

86
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:52,381
I'll go and get your luggage.
- It's already here.

87
00:10:55,616 --> 00:11:00,107
"Should you need anything, you
will find me in my cottage. Bye. "

88
00:11:11,218 --> 00:11:12,616
Greetings, sir!"

89
00:11:16,051 --> 00:11:17,515
So you've arrived!
- Yes...

90
00:11:17,716 --> 00:11:20,512
"Did you receive our letter?
- I did, but since... "

91
00:11:20,717 --> 00:11:23,513
"you didn't turn up, I gave away
the boathouse to someone else. "

92
00:11:24,051 --> 00:11:26,481
"What for?
- You're late by two days, sir. "

93
00:11:26,749 --> 00:11:28,647
We were late by 12 days
last year!

94
00:11:29,049 --> 00:11:32,016
It was different then.
I've let it out this year.

95
00:11:33,584 --> 00:11:35,607
"You must have let it out
to a girl then, right?"

96
00:11:36,051 --> 00:11:37,675
"Yes.
- She's beautiful, isn't she?"

97
00:11:38,049 --> 00:11:40,413
"Yes.
- And young, too?"

98
00:11:42,649 --> 00:11:45,275
Now look! A guest is
dearer than my life!

99
00:11:45,517 --> 00:11:48,677
I'd rather die than hear anything
rude against my guest!

100
00:11:50,249 --> 00:11:56,046
"Try another houseboat, sir...
Allah Baksh has a nice one. "

101
00:12:10,684 --> 00:12:13,582
Take off that sign and
take our luggage inside.

102
00:12:15,215 --> 00:12:19,308
"I hope you consider your guests
dearer than your life, too. "

103
00:12:19,716 --> 00:12:20,647
Of course, sir. "

104
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:23,641
"Don't let anyone
badmouth us, okay?"

105
00:12:24,116 --> 00:12:26,105
"Certainly, sir.
- Now get out stuff. "

106
00:12:26,417 --> 00:12:29,007
Boss! There are two of them!

107
00:12:41,649 --> 00:12:43,172
D'you see what I see?

108
00:12:43,649 --> 00:12:45,672
Retreat! Let's retreat!

109
00:12:47,217 --> 00:12:51,343
"Call me quickly, madam... "

110
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:54,046
Brother! Have you gone mad?

111
00:12:56,249 --> 00:12:58,511
Yes! Go and tell the police.

112
00:12:58,816 --> 00:13:00,645
Not the police.
I'll tell the lady.

113
00:13:01,016 --> 00:13:03,642
"Not a word to her, okay?
- Here I go... "

114
00:13:04,017 --> 00:13:06,639
Now wait... I'll dump you
in the waters!

115
00:13:09,348 --> 00:13:12,645
How could I do that to you?
You are my darling sister!

116
00:13:14,183 --> 00:13:16,240
Your mom asked you to
write a letter everyday.

117
00:13:18,682 --> 00:13:22,376
"Write one to Mr Kishore, too.
- What for?"

118
00:13:22,549 --> 00:13:24,175
You promised him
at the airport.

119
00:13:32,381 --> 00:13:34,678
Dear Kishore...? No.

120
00:13:43,381 --> 00:13:45,506
How did you address your boyfriend
in your first letter?

121
00:13:48,382 --> 00:13:50,609
"I haven't yet got the
chance to do that, missy!"

122
00:13:51,382 --> 00:13:54,008
"But you can call him "darling"...
... No?"

123
00:13:55,381 --> 00:13:57,506
How about sweet-heart?
- Oh no!

124
00:14:19,016 --> 00:14:21,640
Stop it!
- Why?

125
00:14:22,182 --> 00:14:26,137
You're disturbing my mistress!
- What is that?

126
00:14:26,348 --> 00:14:29,440
It's disturbing her...
she doesn't like it!

127
00:14:30,683 --> 00:14:32,309
Doesn't like it? Big deal!

128
00:14:32,781 --> 00:14:36,611
I've let out the houseboat!
Not myself!

129
00:14:37,048 --> 00:14:40,674
I will sing and do as I please!

130
00:14:41,049 --> 00:14:46,140
Won't you stop? I'll tell her
that you have refused!

131
00:14:46,448 --> 00:14:50,677
It's okay! We'll find another
houseboat... just you wait!

132
00:14:54,716 --> 00:14:58,408
"You're scared, aren't you?
- I'm not scared of anyone!"

133
00:14:58,647 --> 00:15:02,944
I'll go and play the music
anywhere I please!

134
00:15:05,015 --> 00:15:06,345
He's a nut!

135
00:19:20,546 --> 00:19:23,172
You didn't stop singing even
after Stella told you to!

136
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:29,403
I've stopped it now...
Am I an awful singer?

137
00:19:30,047 --> 00:19:33,274
I have nothing to do with that.
I just want you to stop.

138
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:37,512
Why?
- I was writing a letter...

139
00:19:38,147 --> 00:19:40,612
I don't want you to sing
when I'm writing!

140
00:19:41,246 --> 00:19:46,701
I get it! I'll never make
such a mistake again!

141
00:19:47,479 --> 00:19:54,641
I will sing only after you
have finished writing!

142
00:19:55,248 --> 00:19:57,712
"May I ask you something, madam?
- What is it?"

143
00:20:00,347 --> 00:20:02,471
"Do I sing well?
- Oh, shut up!"

144
00:20:33,647 --> 00:20:35,009
Wonderful!

145
00:20:47,478 --> 00:20:54,537
"Wake up, madam! Good morning!"

146
00:20:54,746 --> 00:20:56,212
What are you doing
in my bedroom?!

147
00:20:58,546 --> 00:21:03,978
"I bring fresh flowers every
morning, madam. Take a look... "

148
00:21:06,012 --> 00:21:11,639
"All right. In future, always
come after I've woken up. "

149
00:21:12,544 --> 00:21:14,636
And knock before you enter.
Okay?

150
00:21:15,712 --> 00:21:20,009
Okay. I must sing only after
you have finished writing.

151
00:21:21,047 --> 00:21:27,206
And I must bring flowers after
you've awoken. All right!

152
00:21:28,046 --> 00:21:29,013
That's it then...
I will leave now.

153
00:21:34,214 --> 00:21:37,610
"Didn't you like my
brother's song, madam?"

154
00:21:38,378 --> 00:21:41,003
He sings pretty well.

155
00:21:41,312 --> 00:21:43,335
Then why didn't you
give him a tip?

156
00:21:45,079 --> 00:21:47,012
"That's the custom here, madam. "

157
00:21:47,413 --> 00:21:50,708
"When you like something,
you must always tip him. "

158
00:21:52,078 --> 00:21:57,171
Ask Stella to get me some tea
and I will tip your brother.

159
00:22:02,212 --> 00:22:03,303
What is it?

160
00:22:07,012 --> 00:22:09,979
"Mail this letter for me, Raja. "

161
00:22:11,414 --> 00:22:12,471
And listen?

162
00:22:13,179 --> 00:22:14,973
What do you want me to get?
- It's a tip for you.

163
00:22:16,512 --> 00:22:18,307
It's because you sing well.

164
00:22:20,046 --> 00:22:27,671
"Take it... Go on.
- Thank you, madam. "

165
00:22:57,078 --> 00:22:59,510
Wait...! Where are you off to?

166
00:23:00,146 --> 00:23:01,544
I'm going to say a hello
to the neighbours.

167
00:23:03,012 --> 00:23:05,102
I will say hello to them!
- And what will I do?

168
00:23:05,345 --> 00:23:08,572
"Go inside and read the papers!
- No way, boss! I will join you!"

169
00:23:09,178 --> 00:23:11,303
"In that case, d'you know
what I will do?"

170
00:23:12,011 --> 00:23:16,138
I will sack all your family
members who are in my employ!

171
00:23:16,346 --> 00:23:22,470
Sure. Do that. But do remember
the secret I've got to know!

172
00:23:24,345 --> 00:23:28,176
Jhunjhun! You're more of a friend
than a secretary!

173
00:23:28,646 --> 00:23:32,475
"You can join me on a condition.
- Name it, boss!"

174
00:23:33,045 --> 00:23:39,536
You must woo the maid and
I will pursue the mistress!

175
00:23:40,645 --> 00:23:43,610
"Let me carry the flowers.
- But that's mine, boss!"

176
00:23:44,045 --> 00:23:47,273
"Buy another!
- I'm broke, boss!"

177
00:23:54,046 --> 00:23:56,169
Good morning!
- Good morning!

178
00:23:57,044 --> 00:23:59,602
Whom do you wish to see?
- I wish to see you...

179
00:24:00,345 --> 00:24:02,333
and my secretary will
meet with your maid.

180
00:24:03,011 --> 00:24:05,477
I have no maid...
I'm myself the maid.

181
00:24:06,011 --> 00:24:09,238
"In that case, my secretary
wishes to see you!"

182
00:24:09,477 --> 00:24:11,136
And I will meet your mistress!

183
00:24:13,345 --> 00:24:15,140
"Look at me, lady...
I'm a man, too. "

184
00:24:15,345 --> 00:24:19,970
All right. What is it?
- I just came to say hello...

185
00:24:22,011 --> 00:24:27,171
I'm your neighbour and I believe
the Lord's message...

186
00:24:27,612 --> 00:24:31,443
"Love thy neighbour,
if you love me. "

187
00:24:32,444 --> 00:24:34,376
But what brings you here?

188
00:24:35,044 --> 00:24:38,408
I'm here to profess
my love for you.

189
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:41,008
Shut up!

190
00:24:42,312 --> 00:24:45,209
I have heard not a word of
what you say in rage!

191
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:50,004
Just get out...
- Please hear me out.

192
00:24:50,211 --> 00:24:52,541
"Get out, I say!
- Very well. "

193
00:24:53,045 --> 00:24:57,170
Throw me out of the house...
but I'm already in your heart.

194
00:25:03,245 --> 00:25:07,939
I'll hand you over to the police!
- No sweat! I'll fix them!

195
00:25:08,345 --> 00:25:11,276
"No, Raja...!"

196
00:25:18,212 --> 00:25:21,235
Where are you off to?
- To the other hillock.

197
00:25:21,512 --> 00:25:23,169
Won't you sing here today?

198
00:25:23,677 --> 00:25:27,633
I will never sing here again.
- Why? Scared of the lady?

199
00:25:28,178 --> 00:25:35,632
I'm not scared. It's just that
the lady gives me a tip...

200
00:25:36,009 --> 00:25:37,475
when I sing and that
breaks my heart!

201
00:25:37,677 --> 00:25:42,610
Wow! Give someone a 50 paise tip
and he's thrilled!

202
00:25:42,778 --> 00:25:46,007
The lady gave you 10 Rupees and
it still breaks your heart?

203
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:51,174
Yes! It's my heart!
What is it to you?

204
00:25:51,376 --> 00:25:53,605
You're crazy!

205
00:30:53,076 --> 00:30:54,440
You?!

206
00:30:56,076 --> 00:30:57,701
What the hell are
you doing here?!

207
00:30:58,076 --> 00:31:02,973
I've been hearing you sing!
You sing very well!

208
00:31:04,275 --> 00:31:05,969
Here's your tip!

209
00:31:06,609 --> 00:31:11,235
You tip me?! Aren't you ashamed
to equate yourself with me?

210
00:31:12,041 --> 00:31:14,166
Why should I be ashamed?

211
00:31:14,575 --> 00:31:18,633
"You tipped me, when I sang well.
I tip you, when you sing well. "

212
00:31:19,374 --> 00:31:25,000
"Get out! Get out, I say!"

213
00:31:53,074 --> 00:31:54,700
"It's you!
- Yes, madam. "

214
00:31:55,074 --> 00:31:58,508
I will come with the flowers
everyday. Not my brother.

215
00:31:59,075 --> 00:32:01,562
Why not?
- He's scared of you.

216
00:32:02,474 --> 00:32:06,963
Why must a tall and strong man
like him be scared of me?

217
00:32:07,508 --> 00:32:09,303
That's his problem.
I don't know.

218
00:32:10,409 --> 00:32:16,534
All right. Ask him to see me.
- Very well. Good-bye.

219
00:32:22,042 --> 00:32:23,338
Brother...

220
00:32:26,042 --> 00:32:27,472
The lady has sent for you.

221
00:32:29,041 --> 00:32:31,667
Really? Why does
she send for me?

222
00:32:32,108 --> 00:32:34,165
That's her problem.
I don't know.

223
00:32:38,042 --> 00:32:41,666
Was she angry?
- She was asleep.

224
00:32:46,042 --> 00:32:48,007
Must I go then?
- Sure. Go ahead.

225
00:32:53,073 --> 00:32:54,596
Must I really?
- Go on!

226
00:32:57,508 --> 00:33:00,236
Serious... must I go?
- You're crazy!

227
00:33:02,342 --> 00:33:03,966
All right. I'll go over.

228
00:33:22,341 --> 00:33:24,967
"Good morning, madam...
- Good morning. "

229
00:33:26,374 --> 00:33:27,965
Did you send for me?

230
00:33:28,375 --> 00:33:31,668
Yes. Why didn't you come
with the flowers today?

231
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:38,005
Just like that.
- You're scared of me then.

232
00:33:38,374 --> 00:33:41,339
"Not true, madam. I'm scared
of no one, but God. "

233
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:44,007
But your sister said
you're scared of me.

234
00:33:46,041 --> 00:33:49,008
"No wonder. You're like God, too.
- What!"

235
00:33:50,042 --> 00:33:53,008
There's God in all of us, madam!"

236
00:33:54,706 --> 00:33:57,468
Chatterbox! Mail this
letter for me.

237
00:34:00,141 --> 00:34:03,664
May I ask you something?
- What is it?

238
00:34:05,007 --> 00:34:07,938
Whom do you write to everyday?

239
00:34:08,674 --> 00:34:12,368
To my people... my friends.
Why did you ask?

240
00:34:13,007 --> 00:34:21,962
Just like that. Who could
you have in your family?

241
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:26,633
"There's my Mom, my Dad,
a younger brother... "

242
00:34:28,007 --> 00:34:30,167
"And?
- The usual servants, too. "

243
00:34:32,207 --> 00:34:34,367
May I come to the point now?

244
00:34:34,707 --> 00:34:36,297
Your tea is ready, miss. "

245
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:39,404
Haven't you still come
to the point?

246
00:34:40,041 --> 00:34:46,666
No... what do you
write to them?

247
00:34:47,372 --> 00:34:49,202
Don't you know what one
writes in letters?

248
00:34:51,041 --> 00:34:54,996
I'm like the fish in a pond
which dies where it is born.

249
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:59,995
"Besides, what and whom
would I write to anyway?"

250
00:35:00,973 --> 00:35:04,599
You know I'm not educated.

251
00:35:04,974 --> 00:35:06,599
Won't you write to your wife...

252
00:35:07,007 --> 00:35:12,234
should she happen to go
away someplace from you?

253
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:18,296
My wife will always be with me;
I won't let her go anywhere!

254
00:35:21,005 --> 00:35:22,972
You're mad!
- You're right!

255
00:35:23,173 --> 00:35:25,968
"My father was mad, too.
- What?!"

256
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:30,300
It's true. He was an
educated officer.

257
00:35:31,006 --> 00:35:33,971
"He came here on an excursion,
fell in love with my mother... "

258
00:35:34,406 --> 00:35:36,565
quit his job and
married my mother.

259
00:35:38,006 --> 00:35:40,973
Your mother?
- Yes. I was born later!

260
00:35:41,439 --> 00:35:43,338
I had a baby-sister later.

261
00:35:45,041 --> 00:35:46,971
They loved each other very much.

262
00:35:48,439 --> 00:35:54,168
They once went fishing
on a fateful stormy day...

263
00:35:55,374 --> 00:35:57,135
and drowned in the waters.

264
00:35:59,539 --> 00:36:03,266
But they were madly in
love with each other.

265
00:36:04,307 --> 00:36:07,933
Even their bodies were found
holding each other's hand!

266
00:36:10,972 --> 00:36:12,666
"That's my dream, too. "

267
00:36:13,273 --> 00:36:17,261
I want to die with
my hand in hers.

268
00:36:19,006 --> 00:36:21,939
"Who is "her"?
- My wife, of course. "

269
00:36:22,674 --> 00:36:27,298
"Are you married then?
- No! I'm unmarried, too. "

270
00:36:29,339 --> 00:36:31,238
Very well. Go and mail
the letter now.

271
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:35,465
"Well... forgive me if I've
said something wrong, madam. "

272
00:36:52,039 --> 00:36:53,972
Madam...
- Yes?

273
00:36:54,373 --> 00:36:56,669
"I've made up my mind
to study, madam. "

274
00:36:58,706 --> 00:37:01,330
That's a good thing. You can
start going to school.

275
00:37:01,505 --> 00:37:05,438
"No! Not the school!
You must teach me, madam. "

276
00:37:06,573 --> 00:37:08,199
I?
- Yes!

277
00:37:08,972 --> 00:37:12,530
"I'd feel shy going to school,
with tiny tots!"

278
00:37:13,371 --> 00:37:15,428
"But there are night schools
for grown-ups, too. "

279
00:37:15,638 --> 00:37:19,127
Where the old would feel
shy to study with me!

280
00:37:21,273 --> 00:37:23,432
"Do you know the alphabets?
- No, madam. "

281
00:37:24,173 --> 00:37:29,105
I'm not interested in English;
I'd rather learn Arabic.

282
00:37:30,006 --> 00:37:33,165
I don't know that.
- I'll learn Hindi then.

283
00:37:35,173 --> 00:37:36,968
All right. Sit down.

284
00:37:39,172 --> 00:37:41,138
"Sit on the chair.
- No, madam!"

285
00:37:41,339 --> 00:37:45,431
The student sits on the floor and
the teacher sits on the chair.

286
00:38:09,039 --> 00:38:11,006
A... "Aa"... "

287
00:38:18,038 --> 00:38:20,335
E... "Ee"... "

288
00:38:35,806 --> 00:38:37,294
Look at the slate!

289
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:02,430
"All right, miss. "

290
00:39:05,173 --> 00:39:08,296
"Would you mind it if
I say something, miss?"

291
00:39:11,205 --> 00:39:14,536
You're taking a lot of
interest in Raja...

292
00:39:15,239 --> 00:39:17,398
you're even teaching him now.

293
00:39:19,171 --> 00:39:24,468
He's a very nice boy;
decent and simple.

294
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:31,793
"What's wrong if he studies
something, with my interest?"

295
00:39:32,205 --> 00:39:36,797
"I like it, too, madam!
I'll tell him right now. "

296
00:39:37,872 --> 00:39:43,032
Man... woman and a child.

297
00:39:49,105 --> 00:39:53,503
"It's all wrong in here, madam!
- How's that?"

298
00:39:54,206 --> 00:40:00,104
Man and woman are all right.
But this child-stuff is wrong!

299
00:40:03,971 --> 00:40:06,199
"It's okay.
- No, it's not!"

300
00:40:06,839 --> 00:40:08,269
It ought to be like this.

301
00:40:08,837 --> 00:40:13,998
Man and woman marry...
after which the child arrives!

302
00:40:14,839 --> 00:40:19,966
You always misbehave! Don't you
know what to say to a girl?

303
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:35,203
"I'm sorry, madam. But I've never
spoken to a girl before. "

304
00:40:35,505 --> 00:40:37,299
How would I...
- You're a bore!

305
00:40:40,871 --> 00:40:45,100
Tell me what I am to say to
girls. I'll do just as you say.

306
00:40:45,372 --> 00:40:48,802
"You ought to learn some manners.
- What is that, madam?"

307
00:40:49,870 --> 00:40:55,168
"There's a proper way of doing
things. Of talking, dressing... "

308
00:40:55,872 --> 00:41:00,166
"Anything else, madam?
- My foot! Go away now. "

309
00:41:14,237 --> 00:41:15,931
Good-bye, madam. "

310
00:41:54,871 --> 00:41:57,099
Measured steps...
like the gentlemen!

311
00:42:32,338 --> 00:42:34,304
Raja!

312
00:42:37,838 --> 00:42:39,302
Where to?

313
00:42:41,437 --> 00:42:46,166
Why aren't you talking to us?
- I will not talk no nonsense!

314
00:43:33,002 --> 00:43:35,435
Madam! What's gotten into you?

315
00:43:37,838 --> 00:43:39,929
It's you something
has gotten into!

316
00:43:40,238 --> 00:43:43,201
Me? I'm fine.

317
00:43:44,336 --> 00:43:47,063
Didn't you say there's a
proper of doing everything?

318
00:43:47,503 --> 00:43:49,402
I will follow the rules now.

319
00:43:49,903 --> 00:43:53,391
"I will talk properly, walk
properly and dress properly too. "

320
00:43:56,269 --> 00:43:58,929
"No. You don't need to do
all this, Raja. "

321
00:43:59,437 --> 00:44:01,460
You're good as you are.
Very good.

322
00:44:04,804 --> 00:44:07,734
Am I really good as I am?

323
00:44:08,803 --> 00:44:16,328
Yes. You're original
and natural like a rose.

324
00:44:16,803 --> 00:44:20,962
"Not anymore praise, madam!
I'll take off these clothes!"

325
00:44:21,169 --> 00:44:23,499
"Not here, Raja!
Do it in your room. "

326
00:44:24,803 --> 00:44:27,598
"I'm sorry, madam. I will
never wear this dress again!"

327
00:49:08,335 --> 00:49:10,959
Raja! Where are you?

328
00:49:13,101 --> 00:49:16,534
There's a wire for your guest.
- Awire? Is everything okay?

329
00:49:17,002 --> 00:49:19,796
Check out the contents... but
let's have your thumb-impression.

330
00:49:23,334 --> 00:49:26,130
"You've learnt to write, have you?
Who taught you?"

331
00:49:31,833 --> 00:49:33,459
There's a wire for you, madam. "

332
00:49:45,867 --> 00:49:47,231
What's wrong?

333
00:49:47,467 --> 00:49:49,331
I must rush! Dad has met
with an accident!

334
00:49:51,869 --> 00:49:54,096
"Get a taxi, Raja.
- Very well, madam. "

335
00:49:56,867 --> 00:49:59,765
Dad has met with an accident.
I must leave immediately.

336
00:50:00,134 --> 00:50:02,101
Go with Raja and arrange
for the tickets.

337
00:50:09,834 --> 00:50:13,767
"Since I can write
letters now, madam... "

338
00:50:15,168 --> 00:50:16,792
May I write to you?

339
00:50:19,534 --> 00:50:21,499
All right.
- Will you reply to me?

340
00:50:22,834 --> 00:50:24,265
Yes. I will.

341
00:50:24,333 --> 00:50:26,959
Don't worry. Your father
will be fine.

342
00:50:28,001 --> 00:50:31,058
And you must visit Kashmir again
during the next season.

343
00:50:32,834 --> 00:50:36,130
"You will, won't you?
- How can I say that now?"

344
00:50:37,433 --> 00:50:41,127
"You must come, madam. And you
must stay in my houseboat. "

345
00:50:42,234 --> 00:50:45,199
"I will wait for you, without
letting it out to anyone. "

346
00:50:47,366 --> 00:50:48,991
"You will come then, won't you?"

347
00:50:51,934 --> 00:50:56,061
"Okay. I will.
- Thank you, madam!"

348
00:50:57,500 --> 00:51:01,761
I remember... just a minute.
Please don't go away.

349
00:51:09,068 --> 00:51:12,760
Madam! I've brought
a gift for you.

350
00:51:14,834 --> 00:51:19,063
"Thank you so much, Raja. "

351
00:51:20,834 --> 00:51:22,198
"Good-bye, madam. "

352
00:51:34,501 --> 00:51:37,988
"Do you know what saved me, dear?
- A minor accident. That's what. "

353
00:51:38,233 --> 00:51:41,791
Not true. God wanted to
fulfill my last wish.

354
00:51:42,833 --> 00:51:45,299
You must've decided what you
want to do with your life.

355
00:51:45,834 --> 00:51:47,321
I mean...
- I know what you're getting at.

356
00:51:48,365 --> 00:51:51,025
But I didn't even think
of marriage in Kashmir.

357
00:51:51,866 --> 00:51:54,799
Neither did I...
- What makes you smile?

358
00:51:57,134 --> 00:52:00,758
There was this silly boy there
who always spoke of marriage.

359
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:03,295
Whose son is he?
- I don't know.

360
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:05,163
Did you like him?

361
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:08,232
He was a poor man!

362
00:52:08,934 --> 00:52:12,922
There's a letter for you from
Kashmir. It could be his.

363
00:52:18,799 --> 00:52:20,766
Whose letter is it?
- It's from the houseboat.

364
00:52:21,366 --> 00:52:25,195
We forgot to pay him in a hurry.
This must be in that connection.

365
00:52:25,833 --> 00:52:28,196
"Please have 500 Rupees
sent to him, daddy. "

366
00:52:29,232 --> 00:52:31,392
May I leave now?
- Weren't we discussing something?

367
00:52:32,233 --> 00:52:36,496
"The doctor has
advised you rest, daddy. "

368
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:02,162
"My salutations, madam"

369
00:53:03,232 --> 00:53:05,494
"It's just 4 days since
you have left... "

370
00:53:06,465 --> 00:53:13,365
"but it feels as if
it were 4 years"

371
00:53:14,798 --> 00:53:23,028
"I pray for your father's
long-life every morning"

372
00:53:25,201 --> 00:53:28,290
Stella! There's a letter from Raja.
- Really? What does he say?

373
00:53:28,833 --> 00:53:30,265
He has asked about Dad's health.

374
00:53:30,833 --> 00:53:33,298
Now there's a sweet chap.

375
00:53:35,333 --> 00:53:37,128
"We forgot to pay you
the rent in a hurry"

376
00:53:37,834 --> 00:53:39,991
"You will get it
in a day or two"

377
00:53:41,833 --> 00:53:43,957
She thinks I've written to her
for the money!

378
00:53:44,265 --> 00:53:46,788
What else did you
write to her for?

379
00:53:51,834 --> 00:53:55,389
"I will surely visit Srinagar
during the next season... "

380
00:53:55,832 --> 00:54:00,095
"and stay at your houseboat
with Stella"

381
00:54:01,066 --> 00:54:03,191
"You may convey that
to the neighbours"

382
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:05,762
"Right away, madam!
I'll do it right now!"

383
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:13,958
"Hey, guys...!
- What a nut!"

384
00:54:14,134 --> 00:54:15,100
Listen, guys... "

385
00:54:15,267 --> 00:54:16,755
Madam and Stella will be
coming over next season!

386
00:54:17,066 --> 00:54:20,031
"Stella, too? Have you
received a letter?"

387
00:54:20,265 --> 00:54:25,756
Yes. Madam has written to me!
She'll be here next season!

388
00:54:27,332 --> 00:54:30,923
A letter pleases him so much!
What happens if the lady arrives?

389
00:57:33,530 --> 00:57:40,019
"Will you eat today or won't you?
... actually, you'd better not. "

390
00:57:40,797 --> 00:57:44,093
Why?
- It's good to know how to starve.

391
00:57:45,798 --> 00:57:49,422
Because we will soon have
neither rice nor money.

392
00:57:51,131 --> 00:57:53,757
"Listen to me, brother!
Let out the houseboat!"

393
00:57:55,231 --> 00:57:59,357
No. I had promised madam
that I'd wait for her.

394
00:58:00,332 --> 00:58:03,956
For how long? We have lost
half the season already.

395
00:58:04,164 --> 00:58:06,958
Are we going to starve
if she doesn't turn up?

396
00:58:09,430 --> 00:58:14,987
Don't worry. I'll find
a job to feed you.

397
00:58:17,429 --> 00:58:19,396
But I will not give my
houseboat to anyone else.

398
00:58:22,831 --> 00:58:26,195
He was crazy last year...
he's crazier this season!

399
00:58:35,032 --> 00:58:39,428
Kishore has written to say that
he will join you in Kashmir.

400
00:58:39,863 --> 00:58:43,023
But why do you want to
send him with me?

401
00:58:43,263 --> 00:58:48,219
"Your mother and I want you both
to get married, dear. "

402
00:58:48,864 --> 00:58:50,830
It will strengthen the
friendship of our families.

403
00:58:51,298 --> 00:58:53,819
But I don't want to
force it on you.

404
00:58:54,197 --> 00:58:58,823
Spend a few days with him.

405
00:58:59,498 --> 00:59:02,952
"If you approve of Kishore, our
wish will be fulfilled, too. "

406
00:59:03,430 --> 00:59:08,124
But I don't think...
- You haven't met him.

407
00:59:08,830 --> 00:59:11,888
"He's a very good boy.
- Okay, if that is what you wish. "

408
00:59:44,862 --> 00:59:47,158
Gentleman! Whom are
you looking for?

409
00:59:48,863 --> 00:59:50,830
There was a houseboat here
by the name of Gulistan...

410
00:59:51,197 --> 00:59:54,958
"It's still around. Only thing
is, it's now called "Madam"!"

411
00:59:55,863 --> 00:59:57,329
Thank you.
- You're welcome!

412
01:00:00,797 --> 01:00:03,764
"Raja...
- Yes, sir?"

413
01:00:04,131 --> 01:00:06,359
"The houseboat...
- is not to be rented out, sir. "

414
01:00:06,829 --> 01:00:12,354
We booked it a year in advance!
- No. It must've been another one.

415
01:00:12,830 --> 01:00:15,763
This houseboat belongs to madam.
- Madam? Who's that?

416
01:00:15,997 --> 01:00:17,929
Miss Rita. From Bombay.

417
01:00:18,230 --> 01:00:20,320
I see. That's whom I represent.

418
01:00:21,229 --> 01:00:23,787
Do you represent her?
- Of course.

419
01:00:23,996 --> 01:00:25,962
Hasn't she come then?
- She will arrive tomorrow.

420
01:00:27,563 --> 01:00:28,995
Show me around the houseboat.

421
01:00:30,830 --> 01:00:32,795
Come on... it's Rita
who has sent me.

422
01:00:38,563 --> 01:00:40,120
This is the dining room...

423
01:00:40,530 --> 01:00:46,462
and that is madam's bedroom.
You can sleep in that room.

424
01:00:46,863 --> 01:00:51,522
"I will sleep here tonight...
I'll shift out tomorrow, I say!"

425
01:00:52,263 --> 01:00:56,094
"Set my bag down here.
- Very well, sir. "

426
01:01:00,795 --> 01:01:03,762
"Call me over, if you need me.
You'll find me in my room. "

427
01:01:15,095 --> 01:01:18,290
Madam always thought I
was an inquisitive man.

428
01:01:19,330 --> 01:01:23,761
But I can't help it...
can I ask you a question.

429
01:01:24,162 --> 01:01:27,356
What is it?
- Are you the lady's father?

430
01:01:27,563 --> 01:01:29,961
What nonsense! Do I look
like Rita's father?!

431
01:01:32,231 --> 01:01:35,786
You must be her brother then.
- I am not Rita's brother!

432
01:01:37,462 --> 01:01:40,326
You're a servant!
- Don't you talk nonsense with me!

433
01:01:42,830 --> 01:01:48,125
I'm her fiance..
- What are you?

434
01:01:48,595 --> 01:01:50,118
I'm her fiance...

435
01:01:51,862 --> 01:01:53,294
We're getting married very soon.

436
01:02:10,797 --> 01:02:15,160
"I have no cook with me.
Do send me some tea, Raja. "

437
01:02:22,530 --> 01:02:24,016
"Good-day, sir. "

438
01:02:43,829 --> 01:02:47,353
What do you think of my choice?
- It's beautiful.

439
01:02:50,961 --> 01:02:53,951
"Write a letter to your dad, miss...
- Insolent rascal!"

440
01:02:54,362 --> 01:02:56,954
Your father is?!
- No. Raja.

441
01:02:57,529 --> 01:03:01,755
He begged me to stay at this place.
And now that I'm here...

442
01:03:02,794 --> 01:03:06,091
"When he sings today, I will
tell him that he's a nuisance!"

443
01:03:07,129 --> 01:03:10,153
And what if he doesn't sing?
- So?! You may leave!

444
01:03:11,495 --> 01:03:12,927
Good night.
- Good night.

445
01:03:50,496 --> 01:03:53,461
Where's the little girl...

446
01:03:56,828 --> 01:03:58,055
Yes madam.

447
01:03:59,762 --> 01:04:05,160
How are you?
- There's nothing wrong with me.

448
01:04:09,460 --> 01:04:12,757
Where is Raja?
- He's away in the mountains.

449
01:04:14,795 --> 01:04:16,919
What for?
- His business... I don't know.

450
01:04:21,795 --> 01:04:25,421
Can you show me the mountains?
- Certainly. Come along.

451
01:04:35,161 --> 01:04:37,094
"He's on that mountain
out there, madam. "

452
01:09:09,059 --> 01:09:13,014
Raja...
- Madam?

453
01:09:13,827 --> 01:09:15,190
What's wrong?

454
01:09:15,426 --> 01:09:18,516
You were neither at the airport nor
at your houseboat to greet me!

455
01:09:19,826 --> 01:09:21,258
I didn't consider it proper, madam. "

456
01:09:21,826 --> 01:09:23,793
But you'd greet me a hundred
times a day earlier!

457
01:09:24,993 --> 01:09:28,788
"It was different then.
But now, out there... "

458
01:09:30,826 --> 01:09:36,259
What is it? Tell me!

459
01:09:38,526 --> 01:09:43,151
"You will lie again, even
if I ask you something. "

460
01:09:43,859 --> 01:09:47,814
"Why must I lie to you?!
- You did, madam. "

461
01:09:49,259 --> 01:09:53,420
"You said you had dad, mom
and a younger brother... "

462
01:09:54,859 --> 01:09:57,290
you didn't say a word
about your fiance.

463
01:09:58,192 --> 01:10:05,025
My fiance? Who's that?
- Mr Kishore.

464
01:10:15,093 --> 01:10:18,784
What's so funny?
- He's played a joke on you!

465
01:10:21,158 --> 01:10:22,920
Do city-folk crack such jokes?!

466
01:10:24,092 --> 01:10:25,786
"It's his habit, you know!"

467
01:10:26,827 --> 01:10:28,792
But I'm not used to
such sickjokes!

468
01:10:32,158 --> 01:10:33,783
Who is he anyway?

469
01:10:34,826 --> 01:10:40,952
He's a friend dad wants me
to know very well.

470
01:10:41,559 --> 01:10:42,786
What for?

471
01:10:43,092 --> 01:10:45,989
"So I can agree to marry him,
if I get to like him. "

472
01:10:48,592 --> 01:10:51,058
Is marriage left to
your choice then?

473
01:10:51,560 --> 01:10:53,082
Of course!

474
01:10:57,192 --> 01:10:58,818
May I ask you something?
Yes!

475
01:11:02,192 --> 01:11:03,749
Do you like Mr Kishore?

476
01:11:04,525 --> 01:11:06,424
Meet my husband. You will know.

477
01:11:07,793 --> 01:11:10,019
"I will, of course!"

478
01:11:12,958 --> 01:11:17,016
"You want to go to the houseboat
in my "Shikara", right?"

479
01:11:19,159 --> 01:11:20,750
Please come along...

480
01:11:59,291 --> 01:12:01,348
Give me the flowers.
I'll set them in the vase.

481
01:12:04,258 --> 01:12:08,020
Why didn't you get the Nargis?
- I'd have to go far for that.

482
01:12:08,791 --> 01:12:12,086
I don't feel like leaving madam.
- What?!

483
01:12:12,790 --> 01:12:14,416
"That's the name of
my houseboat, sir!"

484
01:12:15,391 --> 01:12:17,017
"You may leave.
- Very well, sir. "

485
01:12:17,225 --> 01:12:22,090
I want the shikara here at 9.30.
I will take the lady out.

486
01:12:28,291 --> 01:12:31,452
"We want to see Mr Kishore.
- By all means, sir. "

487
01:12:56,357 --> 01:12:58,790
Raja! Where's the tea?
... here it is!

488
01:13:04,291 --> 01:13:08,748
A visit to Kashmir
without Amarnath...

489
01:13:09,059 --> 01:13:11,150
is like going to Hardwar and
not taking the holy dip!

490
01:13:11,393 --> 01:13:14,084
You must go there.
Who's going there?

491
01:13:14,290 --> 01:13:16,280
Rita and I.
- Really?

492
01:13:18,391 --> 01:13:19,914
Please sit down.

493
01:13:24,125 --> 01:13:30,023
"Take Stella along, too. She can
look after Rita in the cold. "

494
01:13:32,158 --> 01:13:33,747
Won't you have some tea?
- No thank you.

495
01:13:35,024 --> 01:13:37,287
This tea is just great!

496
01:13:37,825 --> 01:13:43,519
"We love everything about this
houseboat, except its owner!"

497
01:13:43,990 --> 01:13:48,390
Why is that?
- We once came to say hello...

498
01:13:48,559 --> 01:13:51,785
"to Rita, and had to escape
through the waters!"

499
01:13:52,824 --> 01:13:56,052
"He's jealous of us!
Doesn't he envy you, too?"

500
01:13:57,324 --> 01:14:00,722
What's wrong?
- It's only a burp... Go ahead.

501
01:14:02,192 --> 01:14:08,021
As I said...
- What's wrong?

502
01:14:13,791 --> 01:14:19,086
We've taken some great pictures.
I'll get them in a minute!

503
01:14:20,290 --> 01:14:23,155
"I'll go and get the album...
- No, boss! Let me get it!"

504
01:14:23,257 --> 01:14:25,086
It's okay. You can
show it to me later.

505
01:14:25,291 --> 01:14:31,019
No way. You must see it today!
- What am I paid for?!

506
01:14:31,390 --> 01:14:32,879
I'll go and get it.

507
01:14:34,124 --> 01:14:37,421
Are you going to fetch the
same album as I want to?

508
01:14:38,158 --> 01:14:40,747
"Obviously, boss.
I'm in a bad way. "

509
01:14:47,825 --> 01:14:49,121
Let's go!
