"Inspector Vijay Khanna
turned into a battlefield.

68
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,233

"Amongst the people and the assembly.

70
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:19,168
It's police brutality.

71

How can the state treat
an honest politician this way?

72
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,711
Politicians deserve
this kind of treatment.

73
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:23,606
Mr. Tiwari..

74
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:27,617
Entire transportation came
to a standstill for two hours.

75
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:30,244
That doesn't mean
people should applaud..

76
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:32,346
...and encourage such
crazy police officers.

77
00:08:32,411 --> 00:08:34,721
The Law and Order have their place.

78
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:37,661
ACP Vijay Khanna is transferred"

79
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:39,424
...for his irresponsible behaviour.

80
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:52,202
This is ACP Vijay
Khanna's 17th transfer..

81
00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:54,176
...In his 5 years of service.

82
00:08:54,233 --> 00:08:56,611
But this time,
it was no ordinary transfer.

83
00:08:56,769 --> 00:08:58,077
Probably this is the first time"

84
00:08:58,137 --> 00:08:59,639
...in the history of
Police Administration.

85
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:02,618
...when an officer has been
transferred to a different state.

86
00:09:13,686 --> 00:09:14,221
Is sir in?

87
00:09:19,191 --> 00:09:20,169

Students will be questioned
in a geography lectures"

91

...to point out a place in Andhra map..

92
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:36,579
...and tell where ACP Vijay
Khanna isn't transferred.

93
00:09:37,209 --> 00:09:38,153
Are you fond of travelling.

94
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:41,157
...or obsessed with matching
your transfers with your age?

95
00:09:41,213 --> 00:09:44,592
Duty didn't give
me time to introspect.

96
00:09:50,122 --> 00:09:52,568
Some die to come to Mumbai..

97
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:55,603
...and some die after coming here.

98
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:58,240

Your temper and behaviour
is not above the department rules.

Am I clear? - Yes, sir.

102

Stop at the petrol pump.

182
00:14:57,263 --> 00:14:58,742
We'll be at the hotel soon.

183
00:14:58,797 --> 00:15:01,107
I said turn the God darn car now!

184
00:15:05,337 --> 00:15:06,372
Yes, right here.

185
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,187
Thank you!

186
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:21,659
I think you shouldn't go inside.

187
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,428
It's bad. Very bad. - This is worse.

188
00:15:30,996 --> 00:15:32,339
Excuse me.

189
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:37,036
You dropped this.

190
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:38,706
My son would've been
furious if I had lost this.

191
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,444
It's okay. Okay, bye. Bye.
- Nice meeting you.

192
00:15:40,506 --> 00:15:41,507
Bye.

193
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:09,745
Hey! What are you doing?
- Free publicity!

194
00:16:10,002 --> 00:16:12,039
Stop it! - Stop what?

195
00:16:12,104 --> 00:16:13,447
Make the call.

196
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:17,118
Hello... Boss, someone here's taking a picture of us.

197
00:16:17,743 --> 00:16:19,017
Yes, right boss.

198
00:16:33,225 --> 00:16:35,330
Don't try to scare me, I am not scared of you.

199
00:16:35,394 --> 00:16:37,738
Smanalec, taking our pictures. - - Let me go!

200
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:45,513
The rascal was recording everything.

201
00:16:46,772 --> 00:16:48,046
Bring the can of petrol.

202
00:16:49,441 --> 00:16:51,045
Let me go!

203
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:01,228
Let me go!

204
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:02,991
It was a mistake.

205
00:17:18,437 --> 00:17:19,177
Hello!

206
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:20,406
Hello! Police.

207
00:17:52,504 --> 00:17:53,278
Hello.

208
00:18:01,513 --> 00:18:03,459
Sir, you will have to answer our questions.

209
00:18:03,515 --> 00:18:05,586
The motive behind the murder is still unknown.

210
00:18:05,651 --> 00:18:09,292
We're sure that the entire incident will be investigated.

211
00:18:11,557 --> 00:18:12,592
What's happening?

212
00:18:12,658 --> 00:18:15,002
Sir, I immediately sent
the body to the hospital.

213
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:17,563
The doctors say the
body has suffered 80% burns.

214
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:19,473
He's got faint chances of surviving.

215
00:18:24,303 --> 00:18:26,977
Find out who called Control Room and make a case.

216
00:18:27,005 --> 00:18:30,452
Call every criminal even
chain-Snatchers for interrogation.

217
00:18:32,978 --> 00:18:34,389
Prem. -Yes, sir.

218
00:18:34,546 --> 00:18:36,253
Start the investigation.

219
00:18:59,338 --> 00:19:03,252
'The Oil Mafia makes
billions every year..'

220
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:05,310
'..by stealing oil.'

221
00:19:05,377 --> 00:19:09,154
'Many recognised people
in the state are aware of this.'

222
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:13,990
'But only one person
dared to voice against it.'

223
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:17,626
'District Collector Prakash Sathe.'

224
00:19:18,257 --> 00:19:21,067
'The 1994 IAS Batch Topper.'

225
00:19:21,693 --> 00:19:25,004
'He could've taken his
share and made millions.'

226
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:27,537
'Instead,
he took the responsibility.'

227
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:29,169
'..of collecting evidence against.'

228
00:19:29,234 --> 00:19:31,441
'..the biggest nexus in the country.'

229
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:34,006
'And this honest officer's case..'

230
00:19:34,072 --> 00:19:36,245
'..has been handed to a man..'

231
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:40,256
'..who never spent more than
a month in a single police station.

232
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:44,623
'Is it a conspiracy, or the incapability
of the government machinery?'

233
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:48,520
'Or maybe ACP Vijay Khanna's..'

234
00:19:48,587 --> 00:19:50,430
'..been handed this
case intentionally.'

235
00:19:50,489 --> 00:19:54,062
'..so that, he's transferred
even before its solved..'

236
00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:56,572
'..and it never sees an outcome.'

237
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:18,619
Sir's lucky. - Why?

238
00:20:18,684 --> 00:20:21,062
He won't have to publish
a photo in the matrimonial column.

239
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,063
How? - See.

240
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:25,535
This photo will get him
lots of wedding proposals.

241
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:28,561
No. They won't.

242
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:30,502
On their wedding night"

243
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:35,204
...sir will say to his wife,
"Shall I lock you up?"

244
00:20:38,804 --> 00:20:39,578
Sir!

245
00:20:39,638 --> 00:20:42,380
Did you find out
who called control room?

246
00:20:42,441 --> 00:20:43,784
No, sir. Sorry, sir.

247
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:48,150
If I don't get that
information by three..

248
00:20:48,313 --> 00:20:53,058
...then the next second you
two will be out of this station.

249
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:55,127
Now move.

250
00:21:01,526 --> 00:21:02,732
Jay Dev.

251
00:21:06,064 --> 00:21:08,670
Yes, even I found them expensive.
Yes really.

252
00:21:09,401 --> 00:21:10,311
Look. These are nice.

253
00:21:10,369 --> 00:21:12,713
If you had Googled
for this article as well..

254
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:15,549
"Then you wouldn't
be writing this bulls***t.

255
00:21:21,313 --> 00:21:23,554
We print stories.

256
00:21:23,715 --> 00:21:24,785
We don't cook them.

257
00:21:25,651 --> 00:21:28,791
Save that crap for your
newspaper's catch-line.

258
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:31,126
Let me tell you something.

259
00:21:32,024 --> 00:21:34,800
I've done a lot amidst
my 17 transfers.

260
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,231
But you don't have
the guts to print them.

261
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:40,607
Because they aren't stories,
they're the truth.

262
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:45,344
Your eyes are sore and so are mine.

263
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:47,579
But the difference is..

264
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:51,678
...I spent the night
scanning police files"

265
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:56,217
...while you were drinking
free liquor at some Page 3 party.

266
00:21:57,215 --> 00:22:00,128
This is 'Work' and that is 'Hangover'.

267
00:22:04,056 --> 00:22:07,526
In 15 days, you will change
every line of this article.

268
00:22:08,193 --> 00:22:09,501
It's a challenge.

269
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:11,497
Do you know what 'challenge' means?

270
00:22:11,697 --> 00:22:13,608
Look it up on Google.

271
00:22:17,602 --> 00:22:20,515
JD. You didn't say a word!

272
00:22:22,374 --> 00:22:24,047
He's got substance.

273
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:28,020
ACP Vij ay Khan na.

274
00:22:29,314 --> 00:22:31,555
I'm going to bet on you.

275
00:22:35,087 --> 00:22:37,397
Prem. -Yes, sir.

276
00:22:38,056 --> 00:22:39,626
Who is Sher Khan?

277
00:22:42,394 --> 00:22:44,271
Just a car dealer, sir.

278
00:22:44,329 --> 00:22:45,637
In detail.

279
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:48,143
He buys and sells imported cars.

280
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,235
I rn ported buying. .

281
00:22:49,267 --> 00:22:51,713
Then why is there an FIR against him?

282
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:53,744
Go call him. - Sir.

283
00:22:54,106 --> 00:22:57,383
Sher Khan's got no
connection with this case.

284
00:22:57,442 --> 00:22:58,477
Prem.

285
00:22:58,543 --> 00:22:59,817
Sure?

286
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:01,449
Okay, sir.

287
00:23:11,423 --> 00:23:13,494
I want to sell it.
How much will I get?

288
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:15,667
Seven years!

289
00:23:46,691 --> 00:23:49,103
Do you watch Discovery Channel? - Yes.

290
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:53,607
A guy like me buys a car like this,
that's got blood stains.

291
00:23:53,665 --> 00:23:55,440
And thinks it'll be alright.

292
00:23:55,634 --> 00:23:58,615
He goes home.
Switches on his television.

293
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:02,085
And watches Discovery.

294
00:24:03,074 --> 00:24:07,545
The police are hysterically
looking for a man.

295
00:24:08,313 --> 00:24:10,315
The door-bell rings
in the television"

296
00:24:10,382 --> 00:24:12,726
...and in that guy's apartment,
simultaneously.

297
00:24:12,984 --> 00:24:16,397
He opens the door and sees the police.

298
00:24:18,256 --> 00:24:20,634
I'm not interested in
being featured on Discovery.

299
00:24:20,692 --> 00:24:22,330
Why are you scared of the police?

300
00:24:22,394 --> 00:24:24,499
You buy and sell jacked cars.

301
00:24:24,563 --> 00:24:30,138
Sher Khan follows a code
in his illegal business as well.

302
00:24:32,237 --> 00:24:37,311
If you don't want (your) blood stains on
the other side of the car, get lost!

303
00:24:58,563 --> 00:25:02,170
Salaam, Mr. Khan. - Prem. How are you?

304
00:25:02,234 --> 00:25:05,215
Just the usual.

305
00:25:06,037 --> 00:25:10,417
The new ACP's here. 80..

306
00:25:11,109 --> 00:25:12,713
Let's go meet him? - Huh?

307
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:14,649
Yes. Let's go.

308
00:25:40,138 --> 00:25:41,708
Salaam, ACP sir.

309
00:25:46,745 --> 00:25:52,218
You won't sit down
until I tell you too!

310
00:25:52,284 --> 00:25:55,424
This is a police station,
not your home!

311
00:25:55,453 --> 00:25:58,195
It's my decency that
you're still alive.

312
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:00,492
Otherwise your body would
be lying here. - Just shut up!

313
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,334
Don't scream, AC P.

314
00:26:03,261 --> 00:26:05,241
Otherwise you will get a sore throat.

315
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:11,112
And sound really weird
while giving orders.

316
00:26:14,306 --> 00:26:17,515
Even a watchman considers himself
a commissioner in his uniform.

317
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:20,620
You can interrogate me.

318
00:26:21,146 --> 00:26:23,649
Arrest me by all means.

319
00:26:25,717 --> 00:26:27,458
But let go of my collar.

320
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:31,734
Prem. -Yes, sir.

321
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:34,266
Show him out. - No need.

322
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,499
ACP sir, you're new here.

323
00:26:38,229 --> 00:26:40,709
But, I am a veteran here.

324
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,011
Good bye!

325
00:26:53,311 --> 00:26:57,225
He needs a cold drink
to cool down, not tea.

326
00:26:57,649 --> 00:26:59,026
Bring him a cold drink.

327
00:27:14,699 --> 00:27:17,077
Sir. Sir. I've got it.

328
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:18,580
The call girl did it.

329
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:20,578
Call girl?

330
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:23,711
I mean a girl called, sir.

331
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:26,717
Name and address? - That too.

332
00:27:27,078 --> 00:27:28,682
You didn't say that, sir.

333
00:27:30,015 --> 00:27:31,187
Sorry, sir.

334
00:27:37,555 --> 00:27:40,559
He's such a pain in the neck.
- What happened?

335
00:27:41,393 --> 00:27:42,770
I'm going to tell my wife..

336
00:27:43,028 --> 00:27:46,168
...to bake buns on his hot head.
It'll be perfect.

337
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:49,374
His temper is just effete.

338
00:27:49,634 --> 00:27:52,547
Sher Khan left him speechless.

339
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:22,603
Nice. But not my size.

340
00:28:23,501 --> 00:28:27,005
Neither this ...nor you.

341
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:03,047
Khan's busy. Call tomorrow

342
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:19,211
Sher Khan. I don't shake hands
with criminals. Only handcuff them.

343
00:31:33,491 --> 00:31:36,404
Amar. Did you find out anything?

344
00:31:36,461 --> 00:31:38,407
Sir. The informer's
staying at Park Hotel.

345
00:31:38,463 --> 00:31:41,672
She is an NRI. Must have
called from a local SIM card.

346
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:43,804
Let's go.

347
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:50,511
Sir. Room no. 505.

348
00:31:59,183 --> 00:32:01,060
Sub Inspector Prem Patil. - Get out!

349
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:03,190
I know you're imposters!
- Madam. We're the police.

350
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:06,565
See, two stars, the cap, belt"
- I said get out!

351
00:32:09,527 --> 00:32:10,437
How dare you?

352
00:32:10,495 --> 00:32:12,634
You don't fool me
with these fake uniforms.

353
00:32:12,697 --> 00:32:14,233
I know. I know everything.
Just get out.

354
00:32:14,299 --> 00:32:15,676
Will you just listen to me?

355
00:32:16,234 --> 00:32:18,305
Who made you the hotel manager?

356
00:32:18,369 --> 00:32:20,315
There's a 'Do Not Disturb'
board on the door, how..

357
00:32:20,371 --> 00:32:21,611
Will you just shut up!

358
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:24,347
I am ACP Vijay Khanna.

359
00:32:24,409 --> 00:32:27,151
That means Assistant
Commissioner of Police.

360
00:32:27,211 --> 00:32:28,713
He's our senior officer.

361
00:32:29,747 --> 00:32:30,589
Show me your badge.

362
00:32:30,648 --> 00:32:31,524
Show it.

363
00:32:36,554 --> 00:32:37,726
This is not a badge.

364
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:40,201
Badge! Show me your badge!

365
00:32:40,258 --> 00:32:43,501
Listen to me, miss.
This isn't America.

366
00:32:44,395 --> 00:32:48,275
Will you just put
your knife down? Now!

367
00:32:51,436 --> 00:32:53,040
Show me your ID again.

368
00:33:12,523 --> 00:33:14,764
How many times do you bathe in a day?

369
00:33:17,362 --> 00:33:19,638
Sorry, sir. I thought she's nervous"

370
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:22,405
Ms. Mala.

371
00:33:22,734 --> 00:33:24,372
What did you see that day?

372
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:26,610
I saw nothing.

373
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:29,447
Then why call the police?
- I didn't call the police.

374
00:33:31,242 --> 00:33:32,243
These are your call details.

375
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:33,653
The Sim-card's
registered in your name.

376
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:35,657
You think we work in 40's?

377
00:33:36,614 --> 00:33:37,752
Papa had warned me.

378
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:40,253
He told me don't go to India.
India's a dangerous country.

379
00:33:40,318 --> 00:33:41,626
But no, I was stubborn.

380
00:33:41,719 --> 00:33:42,789
Facebook friend's wedding.

381
00:33:43,054 --> 00:33:45,034
Go on, now are you
having fun at the wedding?

382
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:46,562
My flight leaves day after tomorrow

383
00:33:46,624 --> 00:33:48,365
If I leave early, papa's worried.

384
00:33:48,393 --> 00:33:49,633
If I don't, then I'm worried.

385
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:51,640
I haven't stepped out of
this hotel room for two days.

386
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:53,403
First I couldn't sleep due to jetlag.

387
00:33:53,464 --> 00:33:55,307
Now, I couldn't sleep due to fear.

388
00:33:55,466 --> 00:33:56,467
I'm so scared that I haven't called..

389
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:58,639
"Housekeeping or room service.

390
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:01,642
Unnecessarily I called
the cops as well.

391
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:03,549
And now you've come to harass me.

392
00:34:03,608 --> 00:34:05,986
Since morning eating apples,
I've gone bananas.

393
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:07,682
Look.. - I don't want to see anything.

394
00:34:07,745 --> 00:34:09,122
I've seen enough.

395
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:11,160
Watching Hindi Films I
thought India's a lovey-dovey.

396
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:12,660
"Song and dance country,
which it clearly is not.

397
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:15,254
Can you identify the killer?
- I cannot identify anyone.

398
00:34:15,319 --> 00:34:16,696
You're a witness.

399
00:34:17,755 --> 00:34:20,292
I am a simple NRI girl.

400
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:22,727
That came to India
to attend a wedding.

401
00:34:22,994 --> 00:34:24,769
And will return to New
York day after tomorrow

402
00:34:25,096 --> 00:34:26,632
Now please, just leave me alone.

403
00:34:30,635 --> 00:34:31,477
Papa.

404
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:34,349
Hello. - Excuse me.

405
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:37,178
Hello, papa. - Listen to me..

406
00:34:37,442 --> 00:34:39,479
How are you- Papa?

407
00:34:46,017 --> 00:34:49,191
Bring her in half an hour?
- Okay, sir.

408
00:35:04,569 --> 00:35:06,446
I told you everything.

409
00:35:06,504 --> 00:35:08,381
But I'm still being
treated like criminals.

410
00:35:08,506 --> 00:35:10,645
Why are you trying
to add to my problems?

411
00:35:16,547 --> 00:35:17,685
What's your problem?

412
00:35:18,082 --> 00:35:20,221
Are your problems
bigger than his wife's?

413
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:22,453
Are your problems
bigger than his son's?

414
00:35:25,356 --> 00:35:27,495
I thought being a woman
you would have a heart.

415
00:35:29,494 --> 00:35:30,700
You disgust me.

416
00:35:35,366 --> 00:35:37,368
Just get out before I throw you out.

417
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:47,214
N ow!

418
00:35:58,222 --> 00:35:59,667
Jai Hind, sir!

419
00:36:02,293 --> 00:36:04,102
Salve. - Sir.

420
00:36:04,128 --> 00:36:06,108
Found anything? - I'm looking.

421
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:07,438
Keep looking.
- I am.

422
00:36:12,637 --> 00:36:13,615
Sir.

423
00:36:20,578 --> 00:36:23,024
My problem is fear.

424
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:27,352
And maybe I could've lived with it.

425
00:36:27,418 --> 00:36:32,197
But not with guilt.

426
00:36:32,757 --> 00:36:36,330
And thanks for making me realise that.

427
00:36:38,162 --> 00:36:39,505
Do you remember his face?

428
00:36:44,101 --> 00:36:47,139
He has a big scan. - Excuse me.

429
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:49,074
Call the sketch artist.

430
00:37:48,299 --> 00:37:49,277
Sir.

431
00:37:50,234 --> 00:37:51,042
Did you find anything?

432
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:53,013
Sir, he's got no identification proof.

433
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:54,242
How are we going to find him?

434
00:37:56,207 --> 00:37:57,185
Call Sher Khan.

435
00:37:57,241 --> 00:37:58,379
Sir, he's"

436
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:14,160
Will you kick it from that far?

437
00:38:14,592 --> 00:38:18,062
The law's got long arms, not legs.

438
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:25,970
He's done for.

439
00:38:29,707 --> 00:38:32,187
Where's the handcuff?
- Where's the criminal?

440
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:34,385
You closed down your business"

441
00:38:35,046 --> 00:38:36,616
...and so I extended
my hand in friendship.

442
00:38:38,282 --> 00:38:42,128
From today, you will be looking
at a friend, not a criminal.

443
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:45,634
What do they say about me?

444
00:38:46,023 --> 00:38:49,994
"Sher Khan can give his life,
but never break a promise."

445
00:38:51,629 --> 00:38:54,667
If you wanted to be friends,
you could've invited me over dinner.

446
00:38:54,732 --> 00:38:56,177
Why call me at the station?

447
00:38:56,233 --> 00:38:57,473
Sit.

448
00:38:58,469 --> 00:39:00,415
Prem. -Yes, sir.

449
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:03,007
Do you recognise him?

450
00:39:05,643 --> 00:39:06,951
Kataria.

451
00:39:07,478 --> 00:39:09,389
Has a thing for bar-girls.

452
00:39:10,114 --> 00:39:12,025
He handles Teja's petrol-pumps.

453
00:39:12,083 --> 00:39:13,494
Where can I find him?

454
00:39:15,586 --> 00:39:16,587
You will find him.

455
00:39:24,495 --> 00:39:27,669
"I opened my heart."

456
00:39:28,632 --> 00:39:31,408
"And let the fragrance
of love aerate."

457
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:36,179
"Even the moon was dazed."

458
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:39,687
"When I raised my veil."

459
00:39:40,344 --> 00:39:44,656
"Everyone turned their gaze at me."

460
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:46,626
<i>“Shaqﬂa Bane.</i>

461
00:39:47,017 --> 00:39:49,019
<i>“Shaqﬂa Bane.</i>

462
00:39:49,086 --> 00:39:52,727
<i>“Shaqﬂa Bane was an instant hit.“</i>

463
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:57,172
<i>“Shaqﬂa Bane was an instant hit.“</i>

464
00:39:57,361 --> 00:40:01,241
<i>“Shaqﬂa Bane was an instant hit.“</i>

465
00:40:01,532 --> 00:40:06,140
<i>“Shaqﬂa Bane was an instant hit.“</i>

466
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:35,468
"The fever of love."

467
00:40:35,666 --> 00:40:39,546
"Spares no one, young or old."

468
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:43,581
"The fever of love."

469
00:40:44,141 --> 00:40:47,486
"Spares no one, young or old."

470
00:40:49,313 --> 00:40:52,317
"Anyone who took a peak at me."

471
00:40:52,416 --> 00:40:56,228
"Tossed his heart around like a coin."

472
00:40:56,620 --> 00:41:00,727
"They all staned fighting for me."

473
00:41:01,158 --> 00:41:05,197
<i>“Shaqﬂa Bane was an instant hit.“</i>

474
00:41:05,262 --> 00:41:09,142
<i>“Shaqﬂa Bane was an instant hit.“</i>

475
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:13,371
<i>“Shaqﬂa Bane was an instant hit.“</i>

476
00:41:13,571 --> 00:41:17,519
<i>“Shaqﬂa Bane was an instant hit.“</i>

477
00:42:03,153 --> 00:42:05,292
Chicken and Chicks.

478
00:42:05,456 --> 00:42:07,299
The two 'Meows' of life.

479
00:42:10,394 --> 00:42:13,568
No one can ever decide
what's more satisfying.

480
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:15,268
Right?

481
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:21,180
Both the things, no matter
how much you get, seems insufficient..

482
00:42:25,109 --> 00:42:28,522
And when is anything
good insufficient for anyone?

483
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:31,557
Greed ...Greed

484
00:42:31,615 --> 00:42:33,117
And I am fine with it.

485
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:36,160
Because my Guru Abdul Rehman said.

486
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:39,129
Greed over. Progress over.

487
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:41,635
Do you agree with him Gentlemen?

488
00:42:43,627 --> 00:42:47,131
And he also said that every man..

489
00:42:47,431 --> 00:42:51,311
Especially your men,
have the right to progress.

490
00:42:51,702 --> 00:42:55,514
Just see that his greed
doesn't exceed yours.

491
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:58,315
Else it doesn't take
time for him to betray you.

492
00:43:01,478 --> 00:43:05,984
If that happens,
then there's just one option.

493
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:09,062
Man over. Greed over.

494
00:43:11,322 --> 00:43:13,097
Do you agree, Shawn?

495
00:43:13,557 --> 00:43:14,501
Sir..

496
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:22,611
I think ...his answer was yes?

497
00:43:24,501 --> 00:43:26,105
Rascal.

498
00:43:26,403 --> 00:43:29,213
Why is everyone so quiet?

499
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:31,780
All of you are respected people.

500
00:43:32,176 --> 00:43:33,314
Have your lunch.

501
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:48,399
Meow!

502
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:51,170
Meow!

503
00:43:55,032 --> 00:43:56,705
You will never change.

504
00:43:58,035 --> 00:43:59,241
1 kg lost.

505
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:03,244
How about I ...climb over
and help you get it back?

506
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:05,048
I love my bad boy.

507
00:44:05,109 --> 00:44:08,249
What happened to
my good girl's manners?

508
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:10,459
Who will wish me good afternoon?

509
00:44:10,514 --> 00:44:11,618
Good girl's angry.

510
00:44:12,082 --> 00:44:14,562
Because you don't
have any time for her.

511
00:44:15,352 --> 00:44:18,458
Fine. Let me say sorry.

512
00:44:18,722 --> 00:44:21,703
Sorry! Sorry! Sorry! Sorry!

513
00:44:22,259 --> 00:44:23,363
Sir.

514
00:44:25,195 --> 00:44:27,141
Did you work for
the censor board before?

515
00:44:27,197 --> 00:44:29,199
Sir. A girl has identified Kataria.

516
00:44:29,266 --> 00:44:31,576
Kataria's in ACP Vijay's custody.

517
00:44:32,202 --> 00:44:36,082
Okay. What's for Sunday special?

518
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:37,719
The dish is made to order.

519
00:44:39,243 --> 00:44:43,385
Fine. I will handle
him and you handle her.

520
00:44:44,048 --> 00:44:45,254
Okay sir.

521
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:50,765
Sunday Special will be served
after the charity event dinner..

522
00:44:51,088 --> 00:44:52,226
"As a dessert

523
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:54,670
Before that,
I need to prepare for the event.

524
00:44:56,326 --> 00:45:00,069
I am the one that needs Charity.
Do one thing.

525
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:04,078
Invite a guest on my
behalf for tonight's event.

526
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:11,451
The reason I have
a stud farm is that"

527
00:45:11,508 --> 00:45:15,513
...if the petrol prices shoot up by a
rupee or more, I'll travel on a horse.

528
00:45:34,031 --> 00:45:35,476
AC P Vi] 3Y-

529
00:45:36,266 --> 00:45:38,542
My fans call me Mona.

530
00:45:38,702 --> 00:45:40,147
Very good.

531
00:45:40,370 --> 00:45:43,249
All this for ...charity event?

532
00:45:46,143 --> 00:45:47,747
This is charity.

533
00:45:48,078 --> 00:45:49,455
You will get anything you want.

534
00:45:56,153 --> 00:45:58,099
Tej a. AC P Vij ay.

535
00:45:58,689 --> 00:46:01,568
Hello. Rudra Pratap Teja.

536
00:46:01,625 --> 00:46:02,535
Nice meeting you.

537
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:04,504
I've heard a lot about you.

538
00:46:04,561 --> 00:46:06,131
And you still invited me? - Well.

539
00:46:06,196 --> 00:46:08,176
Everyone invites movie heroes.

540
00:46:08,332 --> 00:46:10,676
But no one cares
about real-life heroes.

541
00:46:11,502 --> 00:46:15,348
Seniors call me for a firing
or criminals call to threaten me.

542
00:46:15,405 --> 00:46:20,115
I am happy ...that I brought
a change in the trend.

543
00:46:20,177 --> 00:46:22,521
How about a drink? - I don't drink.

544
00:46:23,514 --> 00:46:25,221
Then start today.

545
00:46:25,382 --> 00:46:28,329
Because no one's ever
refused me in my party.

546
00:46:28,485 --> 00:46:32,433
I am happy ...that I brought
a change in the trend.

547
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:35,604
I haven't heard about you much.

548
00:46:36,126 --> 00:46:41,007
Well, the reason is I work discreetly.

549
00:46:41,365 --> 00:46:44,642
Sir. The media's waiting for you.
- Oh yeah!

550
00:46:46,203 --> 00:46:49,047
Mona darling. He's our special guest.

551
00:46:49,173 --> 00:46:50,550
Take special care of him.

552
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:57,691
This isn't an arrest.

553
00:47:00,117 --> 00:47:02,961
By the way, those who fall for me..

554
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:04,260
...never look for a way out.

555
00:47:04,321 --> 00:47:06,597
You will be wasting your time.
Goodbye.

556
00:47:07,691 --> 00:47:11,571
If Teja sir's special
guest ...leaves high and dry.

557
00:47:12,162 --> 00:47:14,199
Then he'll be really furious.

558
00:47:14,464 --> 00:47:18,139
It's your job to keep him happy.
Not mine.

559
00:47:18,569 --> 00:47:19,547
Good bye.

560
00:47:48,332 --> 00:47:51,541
"It's a fatal night."

561
00:47:51,602 --> 00:47:54,776
"There's something about tonight."

562
00:47:55,205 --> 00:47:58,049
"My desires are not predictive."

563
00:47:58,108 --> 00:48:01,214
"It's a fatal.."

564
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:04,992
"Secrets buried in the heart."

565
00:48:05,415 --> 00:48:08,453
"Wishes are soaring high."

566
00:48:08,952 --> 00:48:11,592
"It's a wonderful situation."

567
00:48:11,655 --> 00:48:15,159
"It's a fatal.."

568
00:48:15,959 --> 00:48:17,370
"Come closer."

569
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:19,340
"Take me in your arms."

570
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:22,434
"Don't torment yourself."

571
00:48:22,566 --> 00:48:29,415
"Enjoy your life in this lifetime."

572
00:48:29,539 --> 00:48:36,320
"Enjoy your life in this lifetime."

573
00:48:36,446 --> 00:48:38,084
"Come closer."

574
00:48:38,148 --> 00:48:39,991
"Take me in your arms."

575
00:48:40,017 --> 00:48:43,157
"Don't torment yourself."

576
00:48:45,088 --> 00:48:51,562
"Enjoy your life in this lifetime."

577
00:48:51,695 --> 00:48:58,544
"Enjoy your life in this lifetime."

578
00:49:12,149 --> 00:49:18,464
"Don't let this silky night ever end."

579
00:49:19,056 --> 00:49:25,439
"Stay in each other's arms,
don't let this dream shatter."

580
00:49:26,096 --> 00:49:32,012
"Don't let this silky night ever end."

581
00:49:32,436 --> 00:49:39,081
"Stay in each other's arms,
don't let this dream shatter."

582
00:49:39,543 --> 00:49:43,582
"As your breath entwines with mine,
I feel tranquil."

583
00:49:46,483 --> 00:49:51,455
"It'll change your life forever."

584
00:49:53,590 --> 00:50:00,200
"Touch my lips ...don't be stubborn."

585
00:50:02,199 --> 00:50:09,014
"Enjoy your life in this lifetime."

586
00:50:09,172 --> 00:50:15,589
"Enjoy your life in this lifetime."

587
00:51:59,816 --> 00:52:00,692
Are you okay?

588
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:01,728
Of course I am okay.

589
00:52:01,985 --> 00:52:03,328
This happens with me often.

590
00:52:03,386 --> 00:52:05,423
Where were you going
at this late hour?

591
00:52:05,655 --> 00:52:07,760
To catch my flight. - What?

592
00:52:08,658 --> 00:52:11,036
Without informing anyone?

593
00:52:11,394 --> 00:52:12,202
I did.

594
00:52:12,262 --> 00:52:14,640
I informed papa.
- I meant how can you go..

595
00:52:14,698 --> 00:52:16,405
...without informing the police?

596
00:52:17,267 --> 00:52:19,611
Why? Am I a terrorist?

597
00:52:20,370 --> 00:52:22,577
You wanted me to identify
the murderer and I helped.

598
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:24,050
Now my job's done.

599
00:52:24,107 --> 00:52:25,450
Your job's done?

600
00:52:25,675 --> 00:52:27,279
You're a witness
not a contract labour.

601
00:52:27,344 --> 00:52:28,414
Shift's over and your job's done.

602
00:52:28,678 --> 00:52:30,282
Who's going to testify in the court?

603
00:52:31,047 --> 00:52:33,254
Why are you yelling at me?

604
00:52:33,550 --> 00:52:36,588
I came to India to attend a wedding,
instead I saw a murder.

605
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:38,631
As my duty, I informed the cops"

606
00:52:38,688 --> 00:52:40,634
...and now look at the mess I am in.

607
00:52:40,690 --> 00:52:43,432
Because of your stupid
emotional dialogues"

608
00:52:43,493 --> 00:52:45,473
...I've taken such a big risk,
and I almost got killed.

609
00:52:45,529 --> 00:52:47,099
And you're yelling at me.

610
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:52,079
I am only asking you to cooperate,
that's all.

611
00:52:52,135 --> 00:52:53,773
Did you see the result of cooperation?

612
00:52:54,204 --> 00:52:56,741
Don't worry.
I'll post cops outside your hotel.

613
00:52:57,774 --> 00:52:59,515
You know, I wonder.

614
00:52:59,709 --> 00:53:01,120
Are you really a cop?

615
00:53:01,678 --> 00:53:03,715
Because how is the hotel
going to give me accommodation"

616
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:06,085
"without a passport and credit card.

617
00:53:08,018 --> 00:53:09,759
Where are you going to stay?

618
00:53:10,387 --> 00:53:12,094
You're actually asking
me that question.

619
00:53:12,222 --> 00:53:14,099
You're asking me that question.

620
00:53:14,491 --> 00:53:16,266
I got in this problem because of you.

621
00:53:16,326 --> 00:53:18,328
I had just one friend and
she's happily on her honey-moon!

622
00:53:18,395 --> 00:53:19,669
And I don't know anyone else.

623
00:53:19,729 --> 00:53:21,470
I got in this problem because of you,
so you're going to solve it.

624
00:53:21,598 --> 00:53:22,372
And if you don't solve this problem..

625
00:53:22,432 --> 00:53:23,570
...I don't know what I am going to do.

626
00:53:23,633 --> 00:53:25,237
I'm just going to sit here..
- Okay, okay, alright"

627
00:53:25,302 --> 00:53:26,303
Okay.

628
00:53:26,703 --> 00:53:29,081
You can stay in my house. Okay, here.

629
00:53:31,241 --> 00:53:32,345
Here?

630
00:53:33,410 --> 00:53:34,320
Excuse me.

631
00:53:34,578 --> 00:53:39,391
No, I mean ...don't you
think this couch's a bit small.

632
00:53:40,217 --> 00:53:42,197
Don't worry I'll sleep here.

633
00:53:42,252 --> 00:53:44,061
No, I was talking about you.

634
00:53:45,088 --> 00:53:46,396
How are you going to fit here?

635
00:53:47,023 --> 00:53:48,024
You'll have a problem..

636
00:53:48,158 --> 00:53:49,796
How are you going to toss around?

637
00:54:41,111 --> 00:54:42,112
Please"

638
00:54:42,245 --> 00:54:44,782
Help me make my passport.

639
00:54:45,282 --> 00:54:47,762
I don't want to be a witness.
I just want to go home.

640
00:54:48,018 --> 00:54:51,090
Try to understand"
- Please, don't even try, okay.

641
00:54:51,154 --> 00:54:54,067
I know that you can't
force any witness.

642
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:56,104
And I can't put my
life at stake anymore.

643
00:54:56,159 --> 00:54:57,263
Let me go home.

644
00:54:57,327 --> 00:54:58,806
You're in an ACP's home. - So what?

645
00:54:59,062 --> 00:55:00,302
The police could be
working for them as well.

646
00:55:00,363 --> 00:55:01,671
I've seen many films.

647
00:55:01,731 --> 00:55:05,076
I want to go..
- You're not on a vacation.

648
00:55:11,207 --> 00:55:13,585
Mala. Your fear is justified.

649
00:55:14,544 --> 00:55:17,991
All I can say is that I
won't let anything happen to you.

650
00:55:18,581 --> 00:55:20,083
You just have to trust me.

651
00:55:26,189 --> 00:55:27,224
<i>Vijay-</i>

652
00:55:29,192 --> 00:55:30,671
ls the couch comfortable?

653
00:55:36,199 --> 00:55:39,009
I learnt it all from Patil sir.

654
00:55:40,136 --> 00:55:42,707
I owe it all to Patil sir.

655
00:55:43,206 --> 00:55:46,210
I would've certainly
met him if he had been alive.

656
00:55:47,477 --> 00:55:49,252
But how did he die?

657
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:51,684
I killed him.

658
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:57,226
Wow. He killed his own boss.

659
00:55:57,487 --> 00:55:59,023
That's so cool.

660
00:55:59,756 --> 00:56:01,633
The dialogue's got you excited.

661
00:56:02,425 --> 00:56:04,063
I wonder what you would have done..

662
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:07,035
...If you had seen me do
the same thing 20 years ago.

663
00:56:08,298 --> 00:56:11,040
You mean ...you killed Abdul Rehman..

664
00:56:17,073 --> 00:56:19,519
Your personality matches with him.

665
00:56:20,110 --> 00:56:21,418
Same age too.

666
00:56:24,514 --> 00:56:27,358
Oh my baby. Are you angry?

667
00:56:27,517 --> 00:56:30,430
What's age got to do
when my mileage is strong?

668
00:56:31,554 --> 00:56:32,760
Really?

669
00:56:33,022 --> 00:56:34,763
Take me on a long-drive
and then I'll believe you.

670
00:56:35,024 --> 00:56:35,661
Sir.

671
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:40,435
Here comes the hand-brake.

672
00:56:40,497 --> 00:56:41,703
ACP Vijay's here.

673
00:56:51,474 --> 00:56:53,545
ACP Vijay. Welcome.

674
00:56:54,144 --> 00:56:55,418
Why did you take the trouble?

675
00:56:55,478 --> 00:56:56,582
You could've called me instead.

676
00:56:56,646 --> 00:56:58,489
There's no Alc in my cabin.

677
00:57:00,717 --> 00:57:02,355
So it would've been
difficult to understand"

678
00:57:02,419 --> 00:57:05,423
...whether the heat was
making you sweat or fear!

679
00:57:07,991 --> 00:57:10,267
The main suspect in Sathe murder case.

680
00:57:10,326 --> 00:57:14,468
Runs a petrol-pump,
which coincidentally belongs to you.

681
00:57:16,566 --> 00:57:18,978
There's a shortage
of petrol in the country"

682
00:57:19,536 --> 00:57:22,073
"not the recruiters
at the petrol pump.

683
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:24,510
250 people work under me.

684
00:57:24,574 --> 00:57:26,645
I can't remember all their faces.

685
00:57:27,343 --> 00:57:29,345
He has no identity proof.

686
00:57:30,013 --> 00:57:31,492
Did you appoint him intentionally.

687
00:57:31,681 --> 00:57:33,490
"So that later he can be forgotten?

688
00:57:33,750 --> 00:57:37,095
Being sceptical is good,
as long as it comes in handy.

689
00:57:37,454 --> 00:57:40,435
But if it turns to sickness,
it can create problems.

690
00:57:42,692 --> 00:57:45,400
Mr. Teja,
being sceptical is not my sickness"

691
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:48,102
"it's a cure for those who lie.

692
00:57:49,666 --> 00:57:51,475
I don't know who he is.

693
00:57:51,534 --> 00:57:53,411
Don't mind, but I'm really busy.

694
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:55,347
It's not like I've a government job..

695
00:57:55,472 --> 00:57:57,418
Kataria's in judicial custody.

696
00:57:58,107 --> 00:57:59,677
And he's got nothing else to do.

697
00:58:00,009 --> 00:58:01,317
He'll remember everything.

698
00:58:03,046 --> 00:58:08,519
Working discreetly
has left you speechless.

699
00:58:09,185 --> 00:58:10,493
Good day, Mr. Teja.

700
00:58:53,596 --> 00:58:55,269
Careful.

701
00:59:10,213 --> 00:59:12,159
Are you here to do a business deal?

702
00:59:12,282 --> 00:59:13,226
Sit straight.

703
00:59:13,383 --> 00:59:15,158
It's business after all.

704
00:59:15,251 --> 00:59:17,356
You sell and I'll buy.

705
00:59:17,954 --> 00:59:19,524
Now, tell me your price for this deal.

706
00:59:20,089 --> 00:59:21,659
Single payment.

707
00:59:22,191 --> 00:59:24,000
What are you staring at?

708
00:59:24,127 --> 00:59:25,697
I know your type well.

709
00:59:26,162 --> 00:59:30,008
They all come at my
petrol-pump for free petrol.

710
00:59:30,333 --> 00:59:34,577
And, sir. You arrested
me on one girl's testimony.

711
00:59:35,171 --> 00:59:37,208
If I make a phone call..

712
00:59:46,215 --> 00:59:49,719
Sir! Sir! Sir!!

713
00:59:50,086 --> 00:59:52,692
Rascal. I am not your servant.

714
00:59:52,722 --> 00:59:54,224
ACP Vij ay Khan na.

715
00:59:54,290 --> 00:59:55,428
ACP!

716
00:59:56,659 --> 00:59:57,467
<i>Vijay-</i>

717
00:59:58,728 --> 00:59:59,672
Stop it.

718
01:00:00,063 --> 01:00:02,009
Sir. Sir.

719
01:00:02,231 --> 01:00:05,144
Sir, let him go.

720
01:00:05,301 --> 01:00:06,780
I said stop it.

721
01:00:13,176 --> 01:00:14,314
In my office.

722
01:00:22,552 --> 01:00:23,690
Sir.

723
01:00:24,587 --> 01:00:25,657
If I hadn't stopped you..

724
01:00:25,688 --> 01:00:27,190
"Then you would've been
rotting in jail instead.

725
01:00:27,256 --> 01:00:29,497
Sir.. - No goddarn explanation.

726
01:00:30,126 --> 01:00:31,764
I'm a commissioner, not your teacher"

727
01:00:31,794 --> 01:00:34,331
...to lecture you on
your discipline and limits

728
01:00:35,365 --> 01:00:36,639
If this happens again..

729
01:00:36,699 --> 01:00:39,339
...I'll be the first one
to put you off this case.

730
01:00:39,402 --> 01:00:41,211
Get it! -Yes, sir.

731
01:00:42,105 --> 01:00:43,641
I don't think you do.

732
01:00:44,374 --> 01:00:47,412
This evening you're
posted on 'Immersion' duty.

733
01:00:48,578 --> 01:00:50,251
Leave. - Yes, sir.

734
01:00:57,787 --> 01:00:58,765
Sir.

735
01:00:59,656 --> 01:01:01,135
Sister-i n-law's here.

736
01:01:01,524 --> 01:01:02,559
Come in, sister-in-law.

737
01:01:02,625 --> 01:01:07,040
Prem. One time I wear Indian
and they call me sister-in-law.

738
01:01:09,699 --> 01:01:11,007
What are you doing?

739
01:01:11,601 --> 01:01:13,308
You're a witness and you're
roaming around so carefree.

740
01:01:13,336 --> 01:01:14,508
Excuse me.

741
01:01:14,570 --> 01:01:17,517
I came here to file an
FIR for my missing passport.

742
01:01:17,573 --> 01:01:19,018
You are not helping me.

743
01:01:19,075 --> 01:01:21,112
But I am not selfish like you.

744
01:01:21,177 --> 01:01:22,588
I brought you lunch.

745
01:01:23,613 --> 01:01:25,524
Smells wonderful. What's inside?

746
01:01:25,581 --> 01:01:28,391
I'll take a peak. - Go ahead.

747
01:01:32,388 --> 01:01:35,494
Starter. The main course
must be in the next one, right?

748
01:01:43,366 --> 01:01:45,368
Sir, you don't need to be on a diet.

749
01:01:45,435 --> 01:01:47,346
That's all I found in his home.

750
01:01:47,403 --> 01:01:49,212
Thank God I can cook, otherwise"

751
01:01:49,272 --> 01:01:51,115
...he would've stayed hungry.

752
01:01:51,174 --> 01:01:52,585
Sir, your home..

753
01:01:55,511 --> 01:01:58,185
Mala, I said I will handle
your passport problem.

754
01:01:58,247 --> 01:01:59,351
What are you doing here?

755
01:01:59,449 --> 01:02:03,693
There was no laptop,
DVD player, no cable TV.

756
01:02:03,753 --> 01:02:05,323
So I was bored.

757
01:02:05,388 --> 01:02:06,492
Bored?

758
01:02:06,556 --> 01:02:08,763
This is a police station, not your..
- Mind it!

759
01:02:09,492 --> 01:02:11,494
I mean this isn't a picnic-spot.

760
01:02:13,362 --> 01:02:14,534
Prem. -Yes, sir.

761
01:02:14,597 --> 01:02:17,203
Take her away. - Where to, sir?

762
01:02:17,533 --> 01:02:19,513
Just tell me where,
I'll drop her. - No.

763
01:02:19,535 --> 01:02:22,106
I know. I'll manage myself.

764
01:02:22,505 --> 01:02:24,542
Okay, bye.
Don't forget the lunch-box.

765
01:02:28,411 --> 01:02:30,152
Si r, sister-i n-law's gone.

766
01:02:30,213 --> 01:02:32,284
She's going alone.
Shouldn't I drop her?

767
01:02:32,381 --> 01:02:35,191
I'll go as well.
Just get out from here.

768
01:02:41,557 --> 01:02:42,627
Madam.

769
01:02:43,526 --> 01:02:45,506
Sir has sent the car to drop you home.

770
01:02:45,661 --> 01:02:47,140
Come.

771
01:03:15,591 --> 01:03:16,592
Madh Island.

772
01:03:17,493 --> 01:03:20,565
<i>6</i> pm. There's going to be a movement!

773
01:03:20,696 --> 01:03:22,198
I am on Immersion duty.

774
01:03:22,365 --> 01:03:24,572
Lord Ganesha's the destroyer of evil.

775
01:03:24,634 --> 01:03:26,580
He doesn't need police protection.

776
01:03:27,770 --> 01:03:31,115
People know that the police
are busy during festivals.

777
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:32,551
So they plan their
movement on these days.

778
01:03:33,409 --> 01:03:36,219
<i>Madh is not in my jurisdiction.</i>

779
01:03:37,246 --> 01:03:41,160
It maybe a tip for you,
but it's a scoop for me.

780
01:03:41,517 --> 01:03:44,293
After Sathe,
I feel you can be trusted.

781
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:46,300
So I'm giving you this information.

782
01:03:48,057 --> 01:03:50,162
Take it ...or leave it.

783
01:03:50,426 --> 01:03:53,464
Ganpati Bappa Morya.

784
01:04:40,042 --> 01:04:41,578
Was it my language or my lecture
that you didn't understand yesterday?

785
01:04:41,644 --> 01:04:43,123
Sir, I had information.

786
01:04:43,179 --> 01:04:46,183
Everyjunkie has some information.

787
01:04:46,249 --> 01:04:48,160
Should I assign them on the force?

788
01:04:48,618 --> 01:04:51,656
This system runs on proof,
not information.

789
01:04:51,721 --> 01:04:53,564
This system crawls, doesn't run.

790
01:04:54,156 --> 01:04:56,432
And, I am ready to slog but not crawl.

791
01:04:57,560 --> 01:05:00,040
There's no point in talking to you.

792
01:05:01,297 --> 01:05:02,537
But I think I'm doing it again.

793
01:05:04,233 --> 01:05:07,077
15 years ago, I was just like you.

794
01:05:07,236 --> 01:05:12,083
So, I don't want you
to go through what I did.

795
01:05:12,141 --> 01:05:14,212
Sir, I cannot stop working
getting scared of those petty things.

796
01:05:14,277 --> 01:05:17,588
What good is your bravado
if you won't be in the department?

797
01:05:21,083 --> 01:05:22,994
I've the recommendation authorities"

798
01:05:23,185 --> 01:05:26,394
...for your promotion
and suspension as well.

799
01:05:27,189 --> 01:05:30,727
Don't think that if the
first will make me happy"

800
01:05:31,060 --> 01:05:33,438
...I will hesitate to do the latter.

801
01:05:34,130 --> 01:05:35,609
Got it? - Yes, sir.

802
01:05:46,409 --> 01:05:48,616
Happy Birthday!

803
01:05:52,648 --> 01:05:54,525
Okay!

804
01:05:56,218 --> 01:05:57,492
So, you're upset because
you're wondering..

805
01:05:57,553 --> 01:06:01,091
...how did I find such
a big national secret?

806
01:06:01,157 --> 01:06:04,661
My Amar-Prem were here, Vijay.

807
01:06:06,429 --> 01:06:07,601
Okay, fine.

808
01:06:07,730 --> 01:06:09,607
Where can I take
you for dinner tonight?

809
01:06:09,999 --> 01:06:11,273
<i>Listen, Mam.</i>

810
01:06:11,534 --> 01:06:14,014
It's not only my birthday
today in the whole world.

811
01:06:14,203 --> 01:06:16,012
So please stop acting like my wife.

812
01:06:16,539 --> 01:06:19,281
I gave you a place in my house,
not my life.

813
01:06:19,642 --> 01:06:21,019
Please.

814
01:06:42,999 --> 01:06:44,103
Mala.

815
01:07:06,055 --> 01:07:07,591
What should I celebrate about?

816
01:07:11,627 --> 01:07:14,073
My parents were killed today.

817
01:09:10,412 --> 01:09:14,224
They were killed probably
for 400-500 rupees.

818
01:09:15,484 --> 01:09:19,398
I only had an uncle,
who was a police inspector.

819
01:09:20,990 --> 01:09:22,992
He took me to Hyderabad.

820
01:09:23,993 --> 01:09:26,337
Raised me, sent me to school.

821
01:09:28,130 --> 01:09:32,010
Every child would wait
the entire year for his birthday.

822
01:09:32,701 --> 01:09:36,410
And I would remain
absent on my birthday.

823
01:09:39,742 --> 01:09:43,019
I tried to run from those memories,

824
01:09:44,313 --> 01:09:47,123
but it would always win.

825
01:09:54,557 --> 01:09:56,400
I am so sorry, Vijay.

826
01:09:58,627 --> 01:09:59,765
It's okay.

827
01:10:00,429 --> 01:10:02,067
Maybe not your memories"

828
01:10:03,999 --> 01:10:06,605
"but I may be able
to win over your loneliness.

829
01:10:09,772 --> 01:10:11,251
I promise.

830
01:10:12,308 --> 01:10:16,279
The only memories you will
have now will be good ones.

831
01:10:23,018 --> 01:10:24,053
I am sorry.

832
01:10:28,457 --> 01:10:33,065
"Now that we're together."

833
01:10:33,295 --> 01:10:37,402
'It's a wonderful feeling."

834
01:10:37,466 --> 01:10:46,352
"Why does everything feel so new."

835
01:10:48,110 --> 01:10:52,718
"Now that we're together."

836
01:10:53,182 --> 01:10:57,153
"It feels so different."

837
01:10:57,186 --> 01:11:05,537
"Every moment I think
of you, only you."

838
01:11:06,762 --> 01:11:09,265
"What is this?"

839
01:11:09,298 --> 01:11:11,608
"Is this love."

840
01:11:11,667 --> 01:11:16,548
"It's happened to me for the first time."

841
01:11:16,705 --> 01:11:22,553
"Whatever this is, it's for you."

842
01:11:22,745 --> 01:11:27,023
"This moment between you and me."

843
01:11:39,428 --> 01:11:43,672
"Your face dwells in my eyes now."

844
01:11:44,366 --> 01:11:48,712
"Your fragrance beats in my heart."

845
01:11:54,243 --> 01:11:59,124
"Your face dwells in my eyes now."

846
01:11:59,181 --> 01:12:02,651
"Your fragrance beats in my heart."

847
01:12:02,718 --> 01:12:07,599
"I can hear your footsteps all the time."

848
01:12:07,656 --> 01:12:13,038
"Your love's evident in me."

849
01:12:13,329 --> 01:12:16,708
"That's your influence on me."

850
01:12:16,765 --> 01:12:21,441
"This is love."

851
01:12:21,737 --> 01:12:25,617
"It's happened to me for the first time."

852
01:12:26,675 --> 01:12:32,182
"It's only for you."

853
01:12:32,715 --> 01:12:37,255
"This moment's for you and me."

854
01:12:37,753 --> 01:12:42,725
"This moment's for you
and me filled with our love."

855
01:12:42,791 --> 01:12:47,501
"Every moment, filled with love."

856
01:12:47,563 --> 01:12:51,636
"Every moment."

857
01:13:04,580 --> 01:13:09,325
Amar. Didn't we take
Sadanand by this same route?

858
01:13:09,752 --> 01:13:11,129
That rape case culprit.

859
01:13:11,186 --> 01:13:13,723
The one who wasn't confessing, right?
- Yes, him.

860
01:13:14,289 --> 01:13:15,768
It's the same van.

861
01:13:16,291 --> 01:13:19,238
He was sitting stubbornly.
- Exactly where Kataria's sitting.

862
01:13:19,294 --> 01:13:21,035
Look, he's staring angrily.

863
01:13:21,096 --> 01:13:24,134
No, sir. I'm not.

864
01:13:24,199 --> 01:13:26,008
This is howl look.

865
01:13:26,068 --> 01:13:27,775
That's what Sadanand said as well.

866
01:13:28,036 --> 01:13:29,447
And, sir..

867
01:13:30,272 --> 01:13:32,309
Slapped him just like this.

868
01:13:32,608 --> 01:13:36,181
You assaulted a police
officer and snatched the key.

869
01:13:36,245 --> 01:13:39,226
No! No!
I didn't do anything.

870
01:13:39,281 --> 01:13:40,521
It was him..

871
01:13:40,582 --> 01:13:42,425
That's what Sadanand said as well.

872
01:13:42,518 --> 01:13:45,761
But sir isn't convinced easily. - Yes.

873
01:13:46,021 --> 01:13:47,625
He got furious and..

874
01:13:47,689 --> 01:13:50,067
What happened next, Amar?

875
01:13:50,125 --> 01:13:52,435
Sir. Sadanand's court appearance
is day after tomorrow

876
01:13:52,761 --> 01:13:55,241
What do we say? - What else?

877
01:13:55,297 --> 01:13:57,299
He was trying to flee after
assaulting a police officer.

878
01:13:57,433 --> 01:13:59,310
And sir shot him.

879
01:13:59,368 --> 01:14:00,972
Bang! Bang! Bang!

880
01:14:01,503 --> 01:14:03,483
The vehicle stopped
at the exact same place.

881
01:14:03,539 --> 01:14:05,382
The driver's got fantastic judgment.

882
01:14:11,180 --> 01:14:15,686
Sadanand didn't get
the time to do this.

883
01:14:16,251 --> 01:14:17,559
Constable.

884
01:14:19,254 --> 01:14:20,699
Turn the vehicle around.

885
01:14:22,391 --> 01:14:25,099
The tanker's stolen as
soon as it leaves the depot.

886
01:14:25,761 --> 01:14:27,536
<i>Every day around
200 Hires of petrol.</i>

887
01:14:27,596 --> 01:14:29,667
...Is stolen from every tanker.

888
01:14:30,666 --> 01:14:34,273
We adulterate the petrol
with kerosene and naphtha.

889
01:14:35,737 --> 01:14:37,546
And later we sell
the adulterated petrol"

890
01:14:37,606 --> 01:14:40,086
"at industries and
small petrol pumps.

891
01:14:43,212 --> 01:14:46,557
The Oil Mafia isn't just
restricted to stealing petrol..

892
01:14:46,715 --> 01:14:49,355
...In fact, their business
runs deeper than the ocean.

893
01:14:52,588 --> 01:14:55,626
The Oil Mafia calls it 'Paani Kana'.

894
01:14:56,124 --> 01:14:59,537
Huge ships, transporting
oil from rigs and refineries..

895
01:14:59,595 --> 01:15:01,233
...have to stop at a point.

896
01:15:01,296 --> 01:15:03,207
It's called 'Bravo Anchorage'.

897
01:15:03,365 --> 01:15:05,538
20 miles away from Mumbai harbour.

898
01:15:05,601 --> 01:15:07,547
The waters beyond
that aren't too deep..

899
01:15:07,603 --> 01:15:10,516
...and so,
small transporters carry them ahead.

900
01:15:10,973 --> 01:15:14,386
The Oil Mafia have an
understanding with the captain.

901
01:15:15,143 --> 01:15:17,054
They alert the mafia..

902
01:15:17,112 --> 01:15:18,557
...as soon as the ship
reaches 'Bravo Anchorage'.

903
01:15:18,647 --> 01:15:20,991
If the coastal guards
are on a strict vigilance..

904
01:15:21,049 --> 01:15:24,030
"The small ships are
directed towards Alibaug.

905
01:15:24,386 --> 01:15:26,525
And then they wait.

906
01:15:27,155 --> 01:15:28,600
For the right time.

907
01:15:31,093 --> 01:15:36,304
Trucks already wait at the
tugs that carry this oil anchorage.

908
01:15:36,532 --> 01:15:39,536
Places like Wadala,
Antop Hill and Kurla.

909
01:15:39,601 --> 01:15:43,105
From there it's sent to
Indian Oil Nagar, Taloja, Deonar..

910
01:15:43,171 --> 01:15:46,084
...and even smuggled outside the state.

911
01:15:46,708 --> 01:15:49,211
To escape police check-posts"

912
01:15:49,278 --> 01:15:52,020
"the drivers are handed fake bills.

913
01:15:52,180 --> 01:15:54,524
In most cases,
the police's cut is decided.

914
01:15:54,716 --> 01:15:56,593
According to an underworld source.

915
01:15:56,652 --> 01:15:58,359
Winning a lottery is sheer luck..

916
01:15:58,420 --> 01:16:02,391
"But oil smuggling can
make you a millionaire overnight.

917
01:16:02,991 --> 01:16:04,971
Diesel bought at 12..

918
01:16:04,993 --> 01:16:08,270
...are sold at Rs.
28-30 to petrol pumps.

919
01:16:08,497 --> 01:16:10,636
If you add up all, the entire nexus"

920
01:16:10,699 --> 01:16:13,509
"has a turnover of 10
billion rupees every year.

921
01:17:28,210 --> 01:17:31,316
Sir. Vijay's taking
Kataria to court tomorrow

922
01:17:34,016 --> 01:17:37,088
Just because his
name's Vijay (Victory).

923
01:17:37,152 --> 01:17:39,462
"He's taking his name seriously.

924
01:17:41,156 --> 01:17:42,430
Look.

925
01:17:42,991 --> 01:17:45,164
Tomorrow's Thursday, my lucky day.

926
01:17:46,094 --> 01:17:48,199
If I don't hear good news"

927
01:17:48,697 --> 01:17:51,337
"then your family will get bad news.

928
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:52,601
Go on.

929
01:17:52,768 --> 01:17:54,372
Good night sir.

930
01:17:57,673 --> 01:17:59,084
Tej a.

931
01:18:00,375 --> 01:18:02,946
Meow!

932
01:18:03,412 --> 01:18:05,414
Meow!

933
01:18:05,681 --> 01:18:08,662
Meow! - Meow!

934
01:18:08,717 --> 01:18:09,991
Meow!

935
01:18:15,657 --> 01:18:16,567
Meow!

936
01:18:24,132 --> 01:18:25,076
Get up!

937
01:18:25,133 --> 01:18:26,703
Enough sleeping, get up!

938
01:18:27,369 --> 01:18:28,677
Hey..

939
01:18:39,247 --> 01:18:41,659
So, your last day in India.

940
01:18:42,617 --> 01:18:45,530
The court appearance
is today and your job is done.

941
01:18:46,555 --> 01:18:48,262
No more of this Vijay troubling you.

942
01:18:54,129 --> 01:18:55,767
Am I a contract labour?

943
01:18:57,199 --> 01:18:58,701
Shift over and I am out.

944
01:19:09,611 --> 01:19:11,181
<i>Just a second.</i>

945
01:19:13,281 --> 01:19:15,056
Yes. - Kataria's dead.

946
01:19:18,353 --> 01:19:20,026
We've just learnt from our sources"

947
01:19:20,088 --> 01:19:23,092
"that the main accused
in Sathe murder case"

948
01:19:23,158 --> 01:19:24,603
...died in police lockup.

949
01:19:25,093 --> 01:19:27,232
It's being assumed
that he died due to..

950
01:19:27,295 --> 01:19:29,741
...being excessively
tortured in police custody.

951
01:19:31,666 --> 01:19:33,168
AcP Vijay, resign!

952
01:19:33,201 --> 01:19:35,181
AcP Vijay, resign!

953
01:19:36,004 --> 01:19:38,177
Such police officers
should be behind bars.

954
01:19:40,275 --> 01:19:42,084
Is this democracy not dictatorship?

955
01:19:42,144 --> 01:19:43,452
ACP Khanna.

956
01:19:43,678 --> 01:19:45,248
To investigate whether Kataria died..

957
01:19:45,313 --> 01:19:48,226
...due to your excessive
third degree or not"

958
01:19:48,550 --> 01:19:50,621
...we'll be forming a commission.

959
01:19:51,353 --> 01:19:53,697
As long as we don't receive
a report from the committee..

960
01:19:54,222 --> 01:19:55,997
...you are suspended.

961
01:19:58,693 --> 01:20:02,664
You're hereby ordered
to surrender your gun. Badge.

962
01:20:03,265 --> 01:20:04,369
And your stars.

963
01:20:19,777 --> 01:20:22,257
No, papa. I can't come.

964
01:20:22,447 --> 01:20:24,393
Yeah, the new passport has arrived.

965
01:20:24,716 --> 01:20:28,425
But, I need the permanent
address change to India.

966
01:20:29,921 --> 01:20:32,299
You will like him once you meet him.

967
01:20:32,624 --> 01:20:34,297
Meet him once.

968
01:20:38,363 --> 01:20:40,400
Papa, I'll.. I'll call you back.

969
01:20:40,465 --> 01:20:42,775
I'll call you back.

970
01:20:43,835 --> 01:20:46,611
My papa's more stubborn than I am,
can you imagine that.

971
01:20:47,238 --> 01:20:50,242
Go back to New York, Mala. - Why?

972
01:20:50,875 --> 01:20:52,877
Have you found a new hot witness?

973
01:20:53,611 --> 01:20:55,249
<i>Get serious, Mam.</i>

974
01:20:55,480 --> 01:20:58,757
My future's uncertain.
- I know what's going to happen.

975
01:20:58,883 --> 01:21:00,521
Everything will be back to normal..

976
01:21:00,585 --> 01:21:01,928
...and we'll celebrate together.

977
01:21:02,187 --> 01:21:03,689
Be practical sometimes.

978
01:21:03,821 --> 01:21:07,359
I'm on the Oil Mafia's hit-list.

979
01:21:08,193 --> 01:21:09,831
I cannot risk your life.

980
01:21:10,428 --> 01:21:12,499
Especially after my suspension.

981
01:21:14,799 --> 01:21:17,370
Would you have left me?

982
01:21:23,374 --> 01:21:26,787
I'll do exactly what your answer is.

983
01:21:31,149 --> 01:21:32,355
You know why?

984
01:21:33,518 --> 01:21:35,259
Because I love Mumbai Police.

985
01:21:37,689 --> 01:21:39,464
We'll be fine.

986
01:21:44,596 --> 01:21:46,439
It'll make you lazier.

987
01:21:46,631 --> 01:21:48,508
It's got so much calories"

988
01:21:48,700 --> 01:21:52,170
"that it won't let
you out of bed for two days.

989
01:21:53,471 --> 01:21:54,575
And it's got so much power..

990
01:21:54,639 --> 01:21:58,212
"That I won't let you
out of bed for two days. - Teja.

991
01:22:13,691 --> 01:22:15,227
Bosco.

992
01:22:22,867 --> 01:22:24,278
Would you like something to eat"

993
01:22:24,435 --> 01:22:25,675
...or my blow has sufficed your hunger.

994
01:22:25,737 --> 01:22:28,650
Actually, I'm here to thank you.

995
01:22:29,274 --> 01:22:30,548
For getting me suspended.

996
01:22:30,608 --> 01:22:33,521
Why? Will you work for me novﬂ

997
01:22:35,780 --> 01:22:37,487
Work against you.

998
01:22:39,250 --> 01:22:41,491
Thank your stars that
I just got you suspended.

999
01:22:42,253 --> 01:22:44,255
You could have retired from your life.

1000
01:22:45,323 --> 01:22:48,327
You'll curse yourself
for not doing so.

1001
01:22:49,894 --> 01:22:52,636
Now, no uniform or superiors.

1002
01:22:53,298 --> 01:22:55,801
Until yesterday,
I had orders not to touch you.

1003
01:22:56,267 --> 01:22:58,873
Now, I've got ways to sc***w you.

1004
01:22:59,537 --> 01:23:03,679
I see. I will dump
you in such a way that"

1005
01:23:04,776 --> 01:23:07,484
...you will be missing in
police records for two years.

1006
01:23:09,747 --> 01:23:12,387
You've been harbouring
a big misconception, Teja.

1007
01:23:13,418 --> 01:23:17,730
Lasting 10 minutes with
Mona doesn't make you a man.

1008
01:23:19,657 --> 01:23:24,538
Face me for 10 seconds and
we'll see who the real man is.

1009
01:23:31,703 --> 01:23:33,273
Dinner's on me, Teja.

1010
01:23:33,538 --> 01:23:34,539
Eat all you can.

1011
01:23:39,177 --> 01:23:39,917
Mona.

1012
01:23:40,678 --> 01:23:41,884
I guess you don't have a problem.

1013
01:23:42,513 --> 01:23:44,151
I hope you've a backup man ready?

1014
01:23:44,215 --> 01:23:47,162
Because he's reached his expiry date.

1015
01:23:47,685 --> 01:23:49,426
Enjoy your dinner.

1016
01:23:52,423 --> 01:23:53,424
No!

1017
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:04,177
What are your intentions?

1018
01:24:04,569 --> 01:24:05,639
Tej a.

1019
01:24:07,705 --> 01:24:10,481
You've lost your position
but not your attitude.

1020
01:24:10,775 --> 01:24:12,846
You should be worried about your job.

1021
01:24:13,511 --> 01:24:15,184
I'll get that back soon.

1022
01:24:15,546 --> 01:24:18,288
Right now, I want to expose Teja.

1023
01:24:18,750 --> 01:24:22,163
You're playing with fire.
- Favourite sport.

1024
01:24:25,857 --> 01:24:27,393
Shivaji Nagar.

1025
01:24:32,263 --> 01:24:35,369
Teja's biggest lair
for oil adulteration.

1026
01:24:37,335 --> 01:24:39,713
I've heard that all
his goods come from there.

1027
01:24:42,240 --> 01:24:46,154
If you can destroy
that Teja will be crippled.

1028
01:24:46,644 --> 01:24:48,817
But how will we get
inside Shivaji Nagar?

1029
01:24:49,447 --> 01:24:52,291
We'll need an army as
big as Shivaji's to do so.

1030
01:24:52,517 --> 01:24:54,519
And the security's tight.

1031
01:24:54,685 --> 01:24:57,928
It's more like a fortress.

1032
01:26:26,544 --> 01:26:28,820
Isn't this place on top of a hill?

1033
01:26:30,815 --> 01:26:34,126
Then we just need a car not an army.

1034
01:26:35,786 --> 01:26:36,730
Can I get it?

1035
01:26:37,655 --> 01:26:38,690
Of course.

1036
01:29:19,116 --> 01:29:22,359
It's said that one out-of-control
car caused the entire disaster.

1037
01:29:22,486 --> 01:29:24,659
The car and the driver
are still missing.

1038
01:29:24,722 --> 01:29:27,464
Was this reckless
driving or a conspiracy.

1039
01:29:27,792 --> 01:29:30,136
"The police are trying
their best to find out.

1040
01:29:30,194 --> 01:29:31,400
The occupants are so shocked"

1041
01:29:31,462 --> 01:29:34,204
...that, they couldn't
say a word to the media.

1042
01:29:38,669 --> 01:29:40,148
Did you see this news?

1043
01:29:42,540 --> 01:29:45,111
I think I know who the driver is?

1044
01:29:45,609 --> 01:29:46,883
Am I right?

1045
01:29:50,147 --> 01:29:53,321
Have you thought about
the result of this fearless act?

1046
01:29:53,384 --> 01:29:54,522
Superhit!

1047
01:29:54,685 --> 01:29:56,289
The show's just started.

1048
01:29:56,520 --> 01:29:58,261
I hope you know what
you're doing, Vijay.

1049
01:29:58,889 --> 01:29:59,890
I am really hungry.

1050
01:30:00,157 --> 01:30:01,568
Come on, let's go have dinner.

1051
01:30:02,827 --> 01:30:04,329
Interval, so soon?

1052
01:30:05,262 --> 01:30:06,434
Have oranges.

1053
01:30:47,271 --> 01:30:49,342
Sir. The warehouse in-charge.

1054
01:30:49,640 --> 01:30:51,517
Sorry, sir. It was a mistake.

1055
01:30:51,609 --> 01:30:52,952
It won't happen again, sir.

1056
01:30:53,210 --> 01:30:54,382
Forgive me.

1057
01:30:54,745 --> 01:30:57,817
I'm very poor. I've a wife and kids.

1058
01:30:58,215 --> 01:30:59,888
I'm the only breadwinner.

1059
01:31:00,551 --> 01:31:01,723
Right?

1060
01:31:02,353 --> 01:31:04,299
That worked in 1973.

1061
01:31:04,555 --> 01:31:06,330
2013!

1062
01:31:06,624 --> 01:31:09,730
Dhoom 3! Jism 2! Sunny Leone!

1063
01:31:12,329 --> 01:31:13,364
Sir, please.

1064
01:31:13,430 --> 01:31:14,704
Let him go..

1065
01:31:16,233 --> 01:31:17,610
Thank you, sir.
- From the roof top.

1066
01:31:17,902 --> 01:31:19,711
Sir! Spare me, sir.

1067
01:31:19,770 --> 01:31:21,374
I won't do it again, sir!

1068
01:31:21,806 --> 01:31:23,342
Let me go, sir.

1069
01:31:23,407 --> 01:31:24,750
Let me go, sir.

1070
01:31:41,458 --> 01:31:44,837
Rascals. What do you
think you're throwing down?

1071
01:31:45,763 --> 01:31:47,242
Can't you even throw a man down?

1072
01:31:53,470 --> 01:31:54,448
Tej a!

1073
01:31:54,505 --> 01:31:58,351
Darling. It's just a murder.

1074
01:31:58,909 --> 01:32:00,286
Sir.

1075
01:32:00,578 --> 01:32:02,717
This guy is next from the rooftop.

1076
01:32:02,780 --> 01:32:04,851
What? - We've information
about the car.

1077
01:32:04,915 --> 01:32:06,690
It was a white Maruti Vitara.

1078
01:32:06,750 --> 01:32:10,664
NIH-04-AB-0703. - That's my car.

1079
01:32:12,790 --> 01:32:14,394
It went missing day before yesterday.

1080
01:32:15,826 --> 01:32:17,464
Was that your car or skin?

1081
01:32:17,628 --> 01:32:19,437
Missing?

1082
01:32:19,763 --> 01:32:22,801
Eve Wone' S out to Sty“. me?

1083
01:32:24,869 --> 01:32:27,281
Did you call the journalist?
- Yes, sir.

1084
01:32:39,917 --> 01:32:42,898
Welcome. Welcome, Mr. Jay Dev.

1085
01:32:43,754 --> 01:32:46,166
Come, sit. Take your seat.

1086
01:32:50,160 --> 01:32:53,903
I'm a crime-reporter,
not a film critic.

1087
01:32:55,199 --> 01:32:57,805
Any special reason to call me here?

1088
01:32:57,835 --> 01:32:59,508
Order drink.

1089
01:32:59,670 --> 01:33:00,944
How do you like it?

1090
01:33:01,372 --> 01:33:04,876
Water, soda or.. - Neat!

1091
01:33:06,277 --> 01:33:08,848
You see, I don't like adulteration.

1092
01:33:09,780 --> 01:33:10,724
Excuse me.

1093
01:33:12,883 --> 01:33:13,725
Thank you.

1094
01:33:13,918 --> 01:33:15,192
You write well.

1095
01:33:15,853 --> 01:33:18,800
But you're wasting your
time writing for newspapers.

1096
01:33:20,758 --> 01:33:23,204
A great personality like
you sends me an invite"

1097
01:33:23,527 --> 01:33:26,633
"after reading my article.

1098
01:33:27,531 --> 01:33:29,511
How can you call it a 'waste', sir?

1099
01:33:29,566 --> 01:33:31,807
Good one. Cheers to that.

1100
01:33:34,271 --> 01:33:36,581
Some journalists
become the headlines"

1101
01:33:36,640 --> 01:33:38,347
...in their own newspaper.

1102
01:33:38,776 --> 01:33:41,586
Anyway, how's this?

1103
01:33:41,879 --> 01:33:48,296
"A crime reporter... forsakes journalism
and hits the jackpot overnight."

1104
01:33:51,322 --> 01:33:54,667
It's my job to write headlines, sir.

1105
01:33:56,360 --> 01:33:57,737
I'll write...

1106
01:33:58,362 --> 01:33:59,739
...what is right.

1107
01:34:00,531 --> 01:34:04,479
After my next article,
everyone will know..

1108
01:34:04,702 --> 01:34:06,579
"Who's leaving his profession.

1109
01:34:09,573 --> 01:34:11,484
How about a massage? It's on me.

1110
01:34:12,476 --> 01:34:14,387
She gives the...best happy ending.

1111
01:34:14,812 --> 01:34:18,658
Because after this,
I can only guarantee your end.

1112
01:34:19,283 --> 01:34:20,762
Can't say it'll be happy.

1113
01:34:21,452 --> 01:34:22,556
Try it.

1114
01:34:30,694 --> 01:34:32,367
Guilty conscious.

1115
01:34:32,730 --> 01:34:35,574
You don't spend time with me,
so you're making it up.

1116
01:34:36,567 --> 01:34:37,705
Chair.

1117
01:34:39,570 --> 01:34:40,674
<i>No, no, no.</i>

1118
01:34:43,240 --> 01:34:46,653
I just want to see you happy.

1119
01:34:48,345 --> 01:34:51,224
Either you're sick,
or I didn't get enough sleep.

1120
01:34:52,816 --> 01:34:54,261
Believe me.

1121
01:34:54,585 --> 01:34:58,727
This evening's...only for you.

1122
01:35:00,858 --> 01:35:04,362
I'll have to order something
strong to handle that much romance.

1123
01:35:04,561 --> 01:35:05,767
Sure.

1124
01:35:09,533 --> 01:35:10,477
Please order.

1125
01:35:10,667 --> 01:35:12,203
I'll be right back.

1126
01:37:19,663 --> 01:37:22,166
I think I'll have
something light today"

1127
01:37:23,267 --> 01:37:24,837
Oh my God! What happened to you?

1128
01:37:25,202 --> 01:37:26,510
The tap in the washroom broke.

1129
01:37:26,570 --> 01:37:30,382
But all this?
- You haven't ordered food yet.

1130
01:37:30,641 --> 01:37:32,177
Come on, order.

1131
01:37:32,342 --> 01:37:36,119
Okay. Caesar salad.

1132
01:37:45,122 --> 01:37:49,298
Hello. - Teja.
You really disappointed me this time.

1133
01:37:49,359 --> 01:37:51,862
You sent just two men to kill me.

1134
01:37:52,462 --> 01:37:54,499
250 men worked under you, right?

1135
01:37:55,232 --> 01:37:56,802
You lost two.

1136
01:37:57,167 --> 01:38:01,138
Next time send the rest 248 together.

1137
01:38:02,306 --> 01:38:04,479
They still won't be able to touch me.

1138
01:38:05,642 --> 01:38:08,452
But you won't have regrets
that you didn't try.

1139
01:38:10,180 --> 01:38:13,286
Sweety. Finally this
dress fits me now.

1140
01:38:13,350 --> 01:38:16,126
I think we burned a
lot of calories last week.

1141
01:38:16,186 --> 01:38:17,392
Look.

1142
01:38:18,589 --> 01:38:20,125
Mona darling.

1143
01:38:20,357 --> 01:38:24,396
I'm on fire and you're
worried about burning calories.

1144
01:38:24,528 --> 01:38:26,474
What the"

1145
01:38:28,465 --> 01:38:31,537
Sweaty! Baby!

1146
01:38:50,687 --> 01:38:52,894
Hey, who are you?

1147
01:38:54,658 --> 01:38:56,660
Hey you, what's your name?

1148
01:39:43,173 --> 01:39:43,674
Hello.

1149
01:39:43,740 --> 01:39:45,276
Did you like the fireworks?

1150
01:39:45,876 --> 01:39:48,447
Happy Diwali, Mr. Rudra Pratap Teja.

1151
01:39:48,578 --> 01:39:50,285
I liked your style.

1152
01:39:50,347 --> 01:39:52,156
I liked your style.

1153
01:39:52,249 --> 01:39:53,728
Very different.

1154
01:39:54,384 --> 01:39:59,356
But children often burn themselves
while playing with fire.

1155
01:39:59,489 --> 01:40:02,663
You're floating in an oil pit,
and playing with fire.

1156
01:40:02,793 --> 01:40:04,238
Advise for me?

1157
01:40:04,828 --> 01:40:06,705
Just a minute. Hold on.

1158
01:40:07,130 --> 01:40:09,167
What is it? - Blood pressure.

1159
01:40:12,402 --> 01:40:15,440
You started all this,
but I'll put an end to it.

1160
01:40:15,772 --> 01:40:17,308
That's my promise.

1161
01:40:17,441 --> 01:40:19,512
I've an idea. Repeat this dialogue..

1162
01:40:19,576 --> 01:40:21,249
...while looking in the mirror.

1163
01:40:24,548 --> 01:40:25,390
Looking in the mirror.

1164
01:40:25,415 --> 01:40:26,257
Looking in the mirror.

1165
01:40:26,450 --> 01:40:28,361
Control. Control. Your health.

1166
01:40:28,418 --> 01:40:32,924
Mona darling,
open your mouth for just one thing.

1167
01:40:33,290 --> 01:40:34,564
Please.

1168
01:41:03,553 --> 01:41:05,260
I need it fixed.

1169
01:41:05,722 --> 01:41:08,259
It's an expensive car.
- High maintenance.

1170
01:41:09,226 --> 01:41:10,671
Vij ay Khan na.

1171
01:41:11,728 --> 01:41:15,767
The one closest can easily
reach for the stranglehold.

1172
01:41:17,467 --> 01:41:19,378
You're closest to Vijay.

1173
01:41:20,904 --> 01:41:25,284
5 million, to put your old
days and my business back on track.

1174
01:41:26,710 --> 01:41:28,451
It's not a bad deal.

1175
01:41:29,312 --> 01:41:31,485
Either you're an arrogant
fool or you hate your life..

1176
01:41:31,548 --> 01:41:34,358
...which is why you came here.

1177
01:41:42,893 --> 01:41:46,466
You should know when to
show your loyalty, understand.

1178
01:41:48,932 --> 01:41:51,936
I'm not standing next to Vijay,
but ahead of him.

1179
01:41:52,569 --> 01:41:54,242
If anything happens to him..

1180
01:41:54,704 --> 01:42:01,622
...I'll put a bullet in you, in a place
where you will regret all your life.

1181
01:42:03,313 --> 01:42:04,587
Get lost.

1182
01:42:34,511 --> 01:42:36,491
I need some information.

1183
01:42:37,781 --> 01:42:38,851
Abdul Rehman.

1184
01:42:39,416 --> 01:42:42,556
Abdul Rehman! Where does he live?

1185
01:42:44,254 --> 01:42:45,858
I had called you yesterday.

1186
01:42:57,467 --> 01:42:58,878
Who is the target this time?

1187
01:42:58,935 --> 01:43:00,505
It's an old case.

1188
01:43:01,371 --> 01:43:03,373
Need to dig up some old graves.

1189
01:43:13,383 --> 01:43:16,728
A case against Abdul
Rehman and Rudra Pratap Teja.

1190
01:43:25,695 --> 01:43:27,675
And these two together.

1191
01:43:29,266 --> 01:43:32,304
By the way,
this hotel makes the best shrimps.

1192
01:43:32,502 --> 01:43:33,674
What a surprise?

1193
01:43:34,337 --> 01:43:36,874
A crime-reporter turns food-critique.

1194
01:43:37,307 --> 01:43:38,377
What happened?

1195
01:43:39,209 --> 01:43:40,381
Big article.

1196
01:43:40,644 --> 01:43:42,487
You were supposed to
write a career-changing story.

1197
01:43:42,546 --> 01:43:43,650
So what happened?

1198
01:43:45,549 --> 01:43:48,894
Sir, stories are for small people.

1199
01:43:49,586 --> 01:43:52,760
People like you have a History.

1200
01:43:55,158 --> 01:43:58,696
You're lucky.
You don't know my history.

1201
01:44:00,897 --> 01:44:02,740
What is it I don't know, sir?

1202
01:44:03,767 --> 01:44:04,905
Abdul Rehman?

1203
01:44:07,170 --> 01:44:08,513
Bhola Gas Agency?

1204
01:44:09,306 --> 01:44:10,410
Prashant Khanna?

1205
01:44:10,941 --> 01:44:13,421
Mr. Teja, how's this for the headline?

1206
01:44:14,644 --> 01:44:19,787
"How a Nagpada Shark
became the King of the Ocean."

1207
01:44:25,722 --> 01:44:28,726
Have a happy ending tonight, Mr. Teja.

1208
01:44:28,792 --> 01:44:31,170
Because from tomorrow you're
going to have a sad beginning.

1209
01:44:31,328 --> 01:44:32,568
Goodnight.

1210
01:44:34,230 --> 01:44:35,641
Yes"

1211
01:44:36,166 --> 01:44:40,808
The shrimps served
in this hotel are the best.

1212
01:44:41,371 --> 01:44:43,180
And..

1213
01:44:47,611 --> 01:44:51,320
I started putting on weight,
especially around my waist"

1214
01:44:57,520 --> 01:44:58,430
Hey!

1215
01:44:58,655 --> 01:45:00,601
How do you like my new look?

1216
01:45:02,325 --> 01:45:03,497
I got it stitched for you.

1217
01:45:03,760 --> 01:45:06,468
I think this suit will suit you.

1218
01:45:09,165 --> 01:45:10,803
So nice you look when you smile.

1219
01:45:11,368 --> 01:45:13,780
You know, after the enquiry's result"

1220
01:45:13,837 --> 01:45:15,874
"everything will return to normal.

1221
01:45:16,139 --> 01:45:17,174
I know it.

1222
01:45:18,174 --> 01:45:20,586
Can we get ready for Khan's party now?

1223
01:45:21,211 --> 01:45:23,191
This suit will suit you better.

1224
01:45:23,413 --> 01:45:24,585
Please.

1225
01:45:25,415 --> 01:45:26,723
Please. Come on.

1226
01:45:26,750 --> 01:45:28,821
Come, come, come.

1227
01:45:54,911 --> 01:45:59,826
<i>“The Lord messed
me with everything.“</i>

1228
01:46:01,685 --> 01:46:06,361
"..by giving me you,"

1229
01:46:07,757 --> 01:46:12,331
"Now I no longer raise my hand.."

1230
01:46:13,596 --> 01:46:19,444
"..after this wish was fulfilled."

1231
01:46:19,669 --> 01:46:24,243
"..after this wish was fulfilled."

1232
01:46:30,814 --> 01:46:33,124
"Oh Pathan."

1233
01:46:47,664 --> 01:46:50,167
"Oh Pathan."

1234
01:46:52,869 --> 01:46:56,578
"Oh Lord, bless my friend
with Your grace."

1235
01:46:56,873 --> 01:47:00,411
"I'm your best friend,
with a heart of gold."

1236
01:47:00,810 --> 01:47:04,155
"I can lay my life for my friend,
I swear."

1237
01:47:04,914 --> 01:47:08,225
"I'm your best friend
with a heart of gold."

1238
01:47:08,885 --> 01:47:12,423
"I can lay my life for my friend,
I swear."

1239
01:47:12,522 --> 01:47:15,469
"I can lay down my life.."

1240
01:47:16,459 --> 01:47:20,703
"I can lay down my
life on your gesture."

1241
01:47:20,830 --> 01:47:24,778
"It's the promise of a Pathan."

1242
01:47:24,868 --> 01:47:28,645
"It's the promise of a Pathan."

1243
01:47:28,838 --> 01:47:33,218
"It's the promise of a Pathan."

1244
01:47:33,343 --> 01:47:37,314
"It's the promise of a Pathan."

1245
01:47:51,161 --> 01:47:54,438
"Bless our friendship
with Your grace."

1246
01:47:55,131 --> 01:47:58,305
"You're the ultimate One.
You're everywhere."

1247
01:47:58,334 --> 01:48:02,214
"No one's got the guts
to lay an eye on you."

1248
01:48:02,372 --> 01:48:06,286
"I stand tall before you."

1249
01:48:10,346 --> 01:48:13,884
"No one's got the guts
to lay an eye on you."

1250
01:48:14,350 --> 01:48:18,093
"I stand tall before you."

1251
01:48:18,321 --> 01:48:22,201
"No one has the courage
to lay a finger on you."

1252
01:48:22,258 --> 01:48:26,206
"My sword will behead
him that moment."

1253
01:48:34,838 --> 01:48:39,116
"I'll always protect
the honour of our friendship."

1254
01:48:39,175 --> 01:48:42,384
"I can lay my life for my friend,
I swear."

1255
01:48:42,545 --> 01:48:45,651
"I can lay down my life.."

1256
01:48:46,516 --> 01:48:50,726
"I can lay down my
life on your gesture."

1257
01:48:50,854 --> 01:48:54,700
"It's the promise of a Pathan."

1258
01:48:55,158 --> 01:48:58,662
"It's the promise of a Pathan."

1259
01:48:59,162 --> 01:49:03,133
"It's the promise of a Pathan."

1260
01:49:03,433 --> 01:49:07,142
"It's the promise of a Pathan."

1261
01:49:20,450 --> 01:49:24,193
"You're dearest to me after God."

1262
01:49:24,254 --> 01:49:27,633
"You've bowled me over
by inviting me here."

1263
01:49:27,690 --> 01:49:31,228
"Your friendship is
the answer to my prayers."

1264
01:49:31,294 --> 01:49:34,673
"You're my benefactor in my life."

1265
01:49:34,731 --> 01:49:36,540
"I can lay down my life for you."

1266
01:49:36,599 --> 01:49:38,340
"I can sacrifice everything for you."

1267
01:49:38,401 --> 01:49:41,780
"if our friendship's at stake"
- I'll put everything at stake."

1268
01:49:41,838 --> 01:49:45,376
"I can lay down my life for you."

1269
01:49:45,408 --> 01:49:48,753
"I can sacrifice everything for you."

1270
01:49:54,284 --> 01:49:55,661
"I can lay down my life.."

1271
01:49:55,852 --> 01:49:57,354
"I can lay down my life.."

1272
01:49:57,553 --> 01:50:01,524
"I can lay down my
life on your gesture."

1273
01:50:01,758 --> 01:50:05,433
"It's the promise of a Pathan."

1274
01:50:05,495 --> 01:50:08,874
"It's the promise of a Pathan."

1275
01:50:09,132 --> 01:50:12,272
"It's the promise of a Pathan."

1276
01:50:27,550 --> 01:50:29,496
Where are you going at this late hour?

1277
01:50:33,923 --> 01:50:35,800
To change Vijay's life.

1278
01:51:12,395 --> 01:51:13,601
What's that?

1279
01:53:28,564 --> 01:53:30,475
You two wait here, please.

1280
01:53:32,735 --> 01:53:35,648
Doctor, please"
- Don't worry, I'll try.

1281
01:53:38,441 --> 01:53:40,580
Don't let anything happen to him.

1282
01:53:41,310 --> 01:53:42,653
He's my friend.

1283
01:53:43,412 --> 01:53:47,189
And India's got a dearth
of tigers and friends.

1284
01:53:47,817 --> 01:53:52,197
One less doctor won't
make a difference. Get it?

1285
01:53:52,488 --> 01:53:53,694
Yes, sir.

1286
01:54:04,534 --> 01:54:05,877
Is it paining?

1287
01:54:07,537 --> 01:54:11,417
Well-known reporter Jay
Dev was shot to death last night.

1288
01:54:12,208 --> 01:54:14,188
Look, it's difficult
to say anything now.

1289
01:54:14,443 --> 01:54:16,650
We're carrying out an investigation,
so...please wait.

1290
01:54:16,712 --> 01:54:18,885
Post his murder, not just in Mumbai..

1291
01:54:19,148 --> 01:54:21,287
...but people in Delhi, Kolkata
and other metropolitan cities"

1292
01:54:21,350 --> 01:54:22,886
...came out on the streets.

1293
01:54:25,788 --> 01:54:27,495
Is he the same Jay Dev?

1294
01:54:27,857 --> 01:54:30,531
He paid the price of trusting me.

1295
01:54:40,469 --> 01:54:42,278
Welcome Amar-Prem.

1296
01:54:42,338 --> 01:54:44,375
Salaam, Mr. Khan. - Salaam.

1297
01:54:44,440 --> 01:54:47,444
We've information that
can prove Vijay sir's innocence.

1298
01:54:47,643 --> 01:54:49,418
A night before Kataria's death"

1299
01:54:49,478 --> 01:54:52,425
"Inspector Salve arrested
a man and put him in lockup.

1300
01:54:52,481 --> 01:54:53,721
For rash driving.

1301
01:54:53,783 --> 01:54:55,387
But there's no record
of the complaint.

1302
01:54:55,451 --> 01:54:58,762
We're completely sure
that man murdered Kataria.

1303
01:54:58,921 --> 01:55:00,923
Where's Salve? - Don't know.

1304
01:55:01,190 --> 01:55:02,362
The car's number?

1305
01:55:03,559 --> 01:55:04,867
His description?

1306
01:55:04,927 --> 01:55:06,668
Description? We've his description?

1307
01:55:09,398 --> 01:55:10,399
Wasim.

1308
01:55:13,569 --> 01:55:15,708
Goodbye. - Goodbye.

1309
01:55:56,312 --> 01:55:58,918
Don't take the trouble. I am there.

1310
01:56:00,149 --> 01:56:01,594
To trouble you.

1311
01:56:02,618 --> 01:56:04,393
Relax.

1312
01:56:05,821 --> 01:56:07,391
Congratulations for the promotion.

1313
01:56:08,257 --> 01:56:09,736
You finally have an Alc cabin.

1314
01:56:11,861 --> 01:56:13,738
I'm very disappointed with you.

1315
01:56:14,430 --> 01:56:17,104
You didn't keep your word.

1316
01:56:18,467 --> 01:56:20,606
You were supposed
to face 248 of my men.

1317
01:56:21,304 --> 01:56:23,181
Instead, it took only
five to bring you down.

1318
01:56:23,239 --> 01:56:25,185
You disappointed me.

1319
01:56:26,542 --> 01:56:28,749
I said I will end this story.

1320
01:56:29,845 --> 01:56:33,383
The moral of this story
is...you don't teach the father..

1321
01:56:34,283 --> 01:56:36,126
"The ways to sc***w.

1322
01:56:36,852 --> 01:56:39,298
Once you're discharged,
leave this city.

1323
01:56:39,789 --> 01:56:42,827
Because you won't be destined
to a hospital every time.

1324
01:56:44,727 --> 01:56:46,798
And by the way, your stay was on me.

1325
01:56:49,865 --> 01:56:53,574
Wow. So, it's you.

1326
01:56:55,571 --> 01:56:57,642
I had a big desire to meet you.

1327
01:56:58,374 --> 01:56:59,375
Does she have a backup plan..

1328
01:56:59,442 --> 01:57:00,819
...or should I handle her?

1329
01:57:02,445 --> 01:57:04,322
Your wish has been granted now.

1330
01:57:04,814 --> 01:57:05,849
Now get out!

1331
01:57:07,550 --> 01:57:09,928
She's hot too but only her temper.

1332
01:57:11,454 --> 01:57:12,797
Meow!

1333
01:57:14,223 --> 01:57:15,531
Made for each other!

1334
01:57:28,537 --> 01:57:29,675
Just finish it.

1335
01:57:31,707 --> 01:57:32,708
What?

1336
01:57:35,277 --> 01:57:37,814
He shouldn't have
the last laugh, Vijay.

1337
01:57:39,815 --> 01:57:41,624
Just destroy him.

1338
01:58:03,806 --> 01:58:05,581
Bosco.

1339
01:58:27,863 --> 01:58:29,672
You've two options.

1340
01:58:30,366 --> 01:58:33,677
Either you walk or I
carry you on my shoulders.

1341
01:58:34,703 --> 01:58:36,444
Think before you speak, Khan.

1342
01:58:36,505 --> 01:58:37,677
This is my area.

1343
01:58:37,740 --> 01:58:40,186
I don't have to deal
with the entire area.

1344
01:58:40,743 --> 01:58:45,453
I'll beat-up a few and the
rest will be scared and will flee.

1345
01:58:48,250 --> 01:58:49,854
Option no. 2!

1346
01:58:50,619 --> 01:58:51,791
No problem!

1347
02:00:41,597 --> 02:00:45,340
Mr. Palande, this mock drill
will be your responsibility.

1348
02:00:51,373 --> 02:00:52,681
What is this nonsense?

1349
02:00:54,810 --> 02:00:58,348
Teja's messenger has a
message for you, Commissioner.

1350
02:00:59,815 --> 02:01:03,763
I killed Kataria on Teja's orders.

1351
02:01:04,353 --> 02:01:06,560
One night before
the court appearance"

1352
02:01:10,292 --> 02:01:11,566
'I hope there's no record of me.'

1353
02:01:11,627 --> 02:01:13,300
'I haven't filed an FIR.'

1354
02:01:13,495 --> 02:01:15,236
'Just finish your job and get out.'

1355
02:01:26,308 --> 02:01:27,309
Speak up.

1356
02:01:28,210 --> 02:01:32,659
In the morning, I released
him before Vijay Khanna arrived.

1357
02:01:38,654 --> 02:01:40,156
Where's Teja?

1358
02:01:46,729 --> 02:01:48,868
Come on, come on, come on, come.

1359
02:01:49,365 --> 02:01:50,867
Pack up,
we've to get to CST in one hour.

1360
02:01:50,933 --> 02:01:52,378
What's the matter, Teja?

1361
02:01:52,434 --> 02:01:54,641
Your men brought me here
without telling me anything.

1362
02:01:55,170 --> 02:01:57,673
Why don't you ever watch
the news channels instead of FTV?

1363
02:01:57,873 --> 02:02:00,353
The police and press are after me.

1364
02:03:13,382 --> 02:03:15,259
Where are you going to run, Teja?

1365
02:03:16,385 --> 02:03:18,490
You're too old and
the world's too small.

1366
02:03:19,688 --> 02:03:22,294
At least I still have my life.

1367
02:03:55,591 --> 02:03:57,366
Rudra Pratap Teja.

1368
02:03:57,626 --> 02:04:01,904
I said you'll regret not killing me.

1369
02:04:02,664 --> 02:04:07,841
And you've made this
mistake twice in 24 years.

1370
02:04:08,871 --> 02:04:12,250
That night, if you had
killed three instead of two..

1371
02:04:12,307 --> 02:04:14,378
"Then you might have lived longer.

1372
02:04:14,777 --> 02:04:18,452
You see,
the police like to count bodies.

1373
02:04:19,114 --> 02:04:21,355
'Ab Tak 56, Chappan - 2'!

1374
02:04:21,416 --> 02:04:23,225
I always forget after I kill.

1375
02:04:23,285 --> 02:04:27,461
You're unfortunate that
an eight year old remembered.

1376
02:04:33,328 --> 02:04:37,299
Prashant Khannamwas my dad.

1377
02:04:40,736 --> 02:04:42,181
I see.

1378
02:04:42,805 --> 02:04:44,580
So honesty runs in the family.

1379
02:04:44,640 --> 02:04:45,584
Hereditary.

1380
02:04:45,641 --> 02:04:46,881
Why did you kill him?

1381
02:04:47,142 --> 02:04:50,885
He was on a suicide course himself,
who am I to kill him?

1382
02:04:51,146 --> 02:04:52,716
I tried to explain to him.

1383
02:04:52,781 --> 02:04:57,594
Don't say a word about the
gas cylinder theft to the police.

1384
02:04:58,187 --> 02:05:00,861
We'll make you rich.

1385
02:05:02,524 --> 02:05:05,471
But, how would he get the title of
being your father, if he had agreed?

1386
02:10:15,270 --> 02:10:17,841
Sir. Maia's here.

1387
02:10:18,707 --> 02:10:19,913
Right, Prem.

1388
02:10:20,142 --> 02:10:22,884
Just because I donned a western
outfit, now you call me Mala.

1389
02:10:23,145 --> 02:10:24,852
Sir, it's the repeat telecast
of the same lunch again.

1390
02:10:24,913 --> 02:10:27,393
One egg, two onions.

1391
02:10:27,883 --> 02:10:29,863
Excuse me, this is no repeat telecast.

1392
02:10:29,918 --> 02:10:32,455
It's breaking news.
Open it and take a peak. - Okay.

1393
02:10:35,724 --> 02:10:36,896
Khan.

1394
02:10:37,459 --> 02:10:38,904
Hello, DCP sir.

1395
02:10:39,161 --> 02:10:42,199
I've invited you over for lunch.

1396
02:10:42,731 --> 02:10:43,607
Hello.

1397
02:10:43,665 --> 02:10:45,667
You've wiped out the Oil Mafia.

1398
02:10:45,734 --> 02:10:47,543
Who's next?

1399
02:10:47,602 --> 02:10:49,878
Another student dies
of drug overdose"

1400
02:10:49,938 --> 02:10:51,713
. . outside Dragon heart Club.

1401
02:10:51,873 --> 02:10:53,875
The time has come when the
government should take measures"

1402
02:10:53,909 --> 02:10:56,651
...to clip the wings of
the Drug Mafia in the city.

1403
02:11:01,616 --> 02:11:03,960
Brother Khan, did you get your answer?

1404
02:11:21,469 --> 02:11:23,642
I'm here, Teja.

1405
02:11:24,472 --> 02:11:27,282
I'm here to tell you
that I will finish you.

1406
02:11:31,680 --> 02:11:35,184
And I promise that
I will take you out.

1407
02:11:35,317 --> 02:11:37,695
"Mumbai and me.."

1408
02:11:37,852 --> 02:11:39,627
"Mumbai's my benefactor."

1409
02:11:39,788 --> 02:11:42,826

02:13:45,680 --> 02:13:47,626
"You stole my peace and slumber."

1440
02:13:47,816 --> 02:13:49,818
