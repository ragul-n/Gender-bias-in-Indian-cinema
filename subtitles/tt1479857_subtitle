'Let us weave the lovely
green leaves with the rain.'

00:02:50,603 --> 00:02:52,628
'Come on, we will
hear of an incident.'

3
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:55,538
'This isan
incident of naughtiness..'

4
00:02:55,808 --> 00:02:57,833
'..anda little bit sensibility.'

5
00:02:58,077 --> 00:03:01,808
'But in reality, this is an incident
of friendship with a friend.'

6
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:05,177
'l am watchingfrom the
space between the leaves.'

7
00:03:05,752 --> 00:03:10,086
'You too come and say..
Come on, pull it off.'

8
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:16,757
Hey. Ritesh is bowled. He is out.

9
00:03:16,896 --> 00:03:17,920
Now, it is my turn to bowl.

10
00:03:18,064 --> 00:03:19,122
Hey, duck. Hey, duck.

11
00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:27,001
Ladiesand gentlemen.

12
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,538
Karan is the next batsman.

13
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:35,912
James Bond Laddu bowlsa fast ball.

14
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:39,518
And Karan has
played a wonderful shot.

15
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:44,887
Oh, no.

16
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:52,957
Great shot, Karan. Excellent shot.

17
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:54,498
Priya, what great shot?
The ball has gone into..

18
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:56,535
..Dracula's bungalow.

19
00:03:56,636 --> 00:03:57,830
Who will fetch it back?

20
00:03:57,971 --> 00:03:59,905
Why did you bowl on
the left side then?

21
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:01,768
Hey, you. l am not
goingto get the ball.

22
00:04:01,874 --> 00:04:03,136
You are batting.

23
00:04:03,276 --> 00:04:05,107
So what if l am batting?
You are the bowler, fielder.

24
00:04:05,211 --> 00:04:06,610
l am not going to get the ball.
- You will get the ball.

25
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:07,937
l told you l am not goingto get it.

26
00:04:08,047 --> 00:04:09,514
Why won't you?

27
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:11,811
Now, don't try to act smart.
- Ladies and gentlemen.

28
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:14,519
The issue of the fight
this week is who will go..

29
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:15,645
..and get the ball.

30
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:18,516
And we have to see
who Priya sides with..

31
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:19,717
..in this great battle.

32
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:21,689
Whatever Karan says is right.

33
00:04:21,828 --> 00:04:24,160
Did you see? Majority wins. Now, go.

34
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:26,656
But you hit that shot.

35
00:04:26,866 --> 00:04:30,063
Buddy, Sehwag hitsa six
and goes to get the ball.

36
00:04:30,203 --> 00:04:31,534
Have you ever seen that happen?
- Yes.

37
00:04:31,638 --> 00:04:33,538
Buddy, we haven't seen Sehwag..

38
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,130
..hit a six for long.
- Hey..

39
00:04:35,241 --> 00:04:36,902
He makesa few runs
and then gets out.

40
00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:38,067
Then what?

41
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:40,179
Okay, Ritesh, it's
your turn next, isn't it?

42
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:42,679
Hey, no. Two balls of
my over are still left.

43
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:44,749
Did you see? That
means you needthe ball.

44
00:04:44,917 --> 00:04:46,714
So, go.
- Go, go. - Go get it.

00:04:49,922 --> 00:04:52,550
Hey, no. lt is l who
always goes to get the ball.

You idiot. You are

120
00:10:58,290 --> 00:10:59,314
You're pretendto

121
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:00,449
..and you're lazing away here?

122

124
00:11:05,264 --> 00:11:06,356
You're taking a false
oath on your mother?

125
00:11:06,632 --> 00:11:07,997
Come, l will teach
you a lesson. Come on.

126
00:11:08,134 --> 00:11:10,034
Sister Chamki is right about you.

127
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:13,599
Okay. What does sister
Chamki say about me?

128
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:15,941
That Mr. Gupta isa very nice man.

00:11:16,075 --> 00:11:18,669
ls it? Sit, sit. Yes. And..

130

What else does she say about me?

00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:23,471
But he does not
have faith in anyone.

132
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:26,483
No, tell her that l will
have faith in everyone. Okay?

133
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:28,951
Sir, forget it. lf you
would have hadfaith..

134
00:11:29,055 --> 00:11:31,023
..you wouldn't
hold my handthis way.

135
00:11:31,323 --> 00:11:33,416
lf l do not hold your hand,
you will run away.

136
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:34,550
Leave this place.

137
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,958
That is what.. sister Chamki
says that if you had faith..

138
00:11:37,063 --> 00:11:39,156
..you would hold my right hand.

139
00:11:40,099 --> 00:11:42,431
Why? What is the
problem with the left hand?

140
00:11:42,568 --> 00:11:43,967
Because l have not
washed my left hand..

141
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,264
..after coming out of the bathroom.

142
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:48,238
Okay. Okay. Hey, go away. You brat.

143
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:49,364
Run away from here.
Come on. Go from here.

144
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:50,499
Go wash your hands. Go.

145
00:11:50,676 --> 00:11:51,700
Useless.

146
00:11:56,649 --> 00:12:00,346
Chamki. Chamki.
- Mr. Gupta, what is it?

147
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:04,048
l want to make you my sister-in-law.

148
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:06,715
Sister-in-law? - No. Actually,
l want to make you my wife.

149
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:09,050
l want to make you the
sister-in-law of all these people.

150
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:11,660
As it is, your parents have agreed.

151
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:13,129
Now, l am waiting
only for your answer.

152
00:12:13,365 --> 00:12:14,992
Mr. Gupta, l do not
believe in an arranged marriage..

153
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:17,296
..but l believe in a love marriage.

154
00:12:17,436 --> 00:12:21,270
Yes, that's it. Because l love you,
l am arrangingthis marriage.

155
00:12:21,774 --> 00:12:23,435
Love is never one-sided.

156
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:25,601
l too love you.

157
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:28,309
Look here. We go to
see a film together.

158
00:12:28,447 --> 00:12:29,505
We eat snacks there.

159
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:32,745
We put two straws in a
coconut and drink coconut water.

160
00:12:33,052 --> 00:12:34,076
This is love.

161
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:37,756
Mr. Gupta this is not love,
but friendship.

162
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:40,420
Friendship? What is love then?

163
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:44,187
When two people love each other..

164
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:47,665
..then their hearts beat together.

165
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:51,660
Flowers bloom on the stems.

166
00:12:53,205 --> 00:12:55,105
There is spring everywhere.

167
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:56,764
Bells start ringing.

168
00:12:57,243 --> 00:12:59,609
That is calledthe miracle of love.

169
00:13:02,214 --> 00:13:04,045
Karan, your breakfast
is ready on the table.

170
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,174

00:13:25,204 --> 00:13:27,104
l love chocolate cake.

178
00:13:27,339 --> 00:13:29,170
Thank you, Mom.
- Yes.

179
00:13:29,441 --> 00:13:30,465
But first milk.

180
00:13:30,843 --> 00:13:32,708
Please, Mom. l am not a kidanymore.

181
00:13:32,845 --> 00:13:34,244
First milk, then the cake.

182
00:13:35,347 --> 00:13:37,577
Grow up, Mom. l have grown up now.

183
00:13:37,683 --> 00:13:38,707
Look at my muscles.

184
00:13:39,518 --> 00:13:42,419
l don't need milk,
because l'm a dude.

185
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:08,203
Leave quickly and get your bag.
You are getting late, isn't it?

186
00:14:25,431 --> 00:14:27,763
Share the cake with your friends.
- Yes.

187
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:30,767
Okay, listen. This is
yesterday's leftover food.

188
00:14:31,303 --> 00:14:33,237
That old man who
sits near the bus stop..

189
00:14:33,505 --> 00:14:35,166
Please give this to that poor man.

190
00:14:35,307 --> 00:14:37,867
Poor? He is very dangerous.

191
00:14:38,277 --> 00:14:40,211
l am not goingto go to that Ravan.

192
00:14:40,312 --> 00:14:41,574
Will you kill your child?

193
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:46,314
Child? Karan, you are a dude, right?

194
00:14:46,452 --> 00:14:48,249
Are you still scared of that beggar?

195
00:14:49,488 --> 00:14:51,820
Karan has not come yet?
- Where has he gone?

196
00:14:52,191 --> 00:14:53,681
There he comes.
- He has come. He has come.

197
00:14:55,361 --> 00:14:58,262
Hi.
- Laddu, you look very thin.

198
00:14:58,530 --> 00:14:59,554
Didn't you have your breakfast?

199
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:03,567
l did have my breakfast,
but oh, yes..

200
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:05,261
l didn't have my dinner last night.

201
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:08,202
Mummy had prepared
bitter gourd. Oh, no.

202
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:11,172
Therefore, l went
on a hunger strike.

203
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:14,370
Then there must be a lot of
food left from last night.

204
00:15:14,513 --> 00:15:15,537
You..

205
00:15:15,648 --> 00:15:16,672
Oh, l remembered.

206
00:15:16,782 --> 00:15:18,181
l'll come in a moment. Catch this.

207
00:15:18,317 --> 00:15:19,477
Yes, come soon.
- Catch this.

208
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:22,612
Hey, come soon.
Otherwise we will miss the bus.

209
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:24,917
Am l really lookingthin?

210
00:15:31,697 --> 00:15:34,860
Karan, you are goingto that Ravan?

211
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:41,934
His hair is like that of a spider.
Long beard. Dirty clothes.

212
00:15:42,808 --> 00:15:44,742
He isa devil. Adevil.

213
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:51,747
Ravan's soul is trapped in that bag.

214
00:15:51,984 --> 00:15:55,283
That is why he always
keeps the bag near him.

215
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:58,217
With black magic,
he traps children..

216
00:15:58,324 --> 00:16:00,952
..and keeps them in that bag.

217
00:16:05,864 --> 00:16:08,230
You are going alone to Ravan's cave.

218
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:11,535
l will not be able to live
if something happens to you.

219
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:12,828
l will die.

220
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:15,866
Karan, wait. Please. Don't go.

221
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:34,549
Leave from here. Go. Run.

222
00:16:35,894 --> 00:16:37,327
Do not trouble me.

223
00:16:38,564 --> 00:16:40,691
l told you.. run away from here.

224
00:16:43,035 --> 00:16:44,297
l don't have anything.

225
00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:49,364
Abeggar does not
have anything to give.

226
00:16:49,608 --> 00:16:52,338
No, no. l have not come to take.
l have come to give you something.

227
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:54,403
Karan.

228
00:16:56,315 --> 00:16:58,408
Karan, come quickly. Hurry up.

229
00:17:29,481 --> 00:17:31,608
Come on. Hurry up.

230
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,022
Please pay attention here.

231
00:17:43,629 --> 00:17:44,789
Tell me one thing.

232
00:17:45,364 --> 00:17:48,333
This building or our houses..
what raw material..

233
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:49,867
..are they made from?

234
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:52,332
Madam.
- Yes, Preeti.

235
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:54,838
Madam, bricksand cement are used.

236
00:17:55,374 --> 00:17:59,401
Very good. But some housesare
not made of bricksand cement.

237
00:17:59,845 --> 00:18:00,869
l will show you how.

238
00:18:00,979 --> 00:18:02,378
Amit, switch off the lights.

239
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:05,474
Now, see this.

240
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:10,715
This isan igloo. ln cold
regions like the Arctic area..

241
00:18:10,823 --> 00:18:12,347
..people stay in igloos.

242
00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:14,356
Now, look at this picture.

243
00:18:14,993 --> 00:18:16,358
This isa tent house.

244
00:18:16,662 --> 00:18:19,859
People in the desert
live in tent houses.

245
00:18:19,998 --> 00:18:22,364
Children, both these
housesare not made of bricks..

246
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:23,492
..or cement.

247
00:18:23,802 --> 00:18:25,895
lgloosare made up of ice blocks.

248
00:18:26,071 --> 00:18:27,766
And tentsare made up of cloth.

249
00:18:28,006 --> 00:18:29,371
Amit, switch on the lights.

250
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:34,579
So, your project for this term
is to find houses made up of..

251
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,806
..different raw materials.

252
00:18:36,081 --> 00:18:38,379
Then you have to make a
model of that and share..

253
00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:40,384
..the information about those
houses with all the other students.

254
00:18:40,486 --> 00:18:42,886
lsn't it exciting?
- Yes.

255
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:47,024
Come on. Quickly
open your lunch boxes.

256
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:48,586
l am very hungry.

257
00:18:48,927 --> 00:18:52,385
Bread rolls. Samosas (fried
potato patties) and chips.

258
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:54,398
Creamy chocolate cake.

259
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:58,766
Wow. Take my tiffin.
Just give me two pieces.

260
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,939
Hey, wait. Let me think.

261
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:06,571
Priya, what about you? - No, no.
There are many calories in a cake.

262
00:19:07,112 --> 00:19:10,104
l am taking part in the
'School's Ms. Photogenic contest.'

263
00:19:11,116 --> 00:19:13,414
Salad, anyone?
- Oh, no. - Oh, no.

264
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:16,415
l will give you one roll.
l want two pieces of cake.

265
00:19:16,955 --> 00:19:19,423
lf you want two pieces of cake,
then you must give me..

266
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:21,425
..two vegetable rolls.
Think about it.

267
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:24,423
Hey, both of you. Fight later.
Karan, you can take..

268
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:27,431
..my entire lunch. But
give me my two pieces.

269
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:30,463
l will settle this with you later.

270
00:19:36,475 --> 00:19:37,499
Oh.

271
00:19:44,082 --> 00:19:45,447
What kind of mischief is this?

272
00:19:45,551 --> 00:19:46,575
Where's the cake?

273
00:19:50,489 --> 00:19:52,980
Oh, no. l gave the
cake to that Ravan.

274
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:54,988
Achocolate cake to
that demon beggar?

275
00:19:55,093 --> 00:19:56,822
And stale foodto your friends?

276
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,462
This is the era of the evil.

277
00:20:00,499 --> 00:20:01,898
He is very scared of Ravan.

278
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,025
That is why he has compromised
by giving him the entire cake.

279
00:20:04,136 --> 00:20:06,536
Hey, you. Keep quiet. ln a
hurry to catch the bus..

280
00:20:06,638 --> 00:20:07,662
..l made this mistake.

281
00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:08,831
lf l would have
been scared of Ravan..

282
00:20:08,974 --> 00:20:10,464
..then why would l
go alone to his hut?

283
00:20:10,576 --> 00:20:13,170
Alone? We all were standing
behind you at the bus stop.

284
00:20:13,512 --> 00:20:15,810
He was walking on that
same roadthe day before.

285
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:18,744
As soon as he came near
the hut, he started running.

286
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:21,751
He wasalone. l saw
everythingfrom my balcony.

287
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:23,745
You coward.

288
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,990
You take one roll
and give me one Samosa.

289
00:20:26,124 --> 00:20:28,490
Hey, you. l am not scared of him.

290
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:31,491
l will bringthat
cake back today evening.

291
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:32,954
Just watch.

292
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:43,735
Bye, Ritesh.
- Bye, Laddu.

293
00:20:43,842 --> 00:20:46,345
Bye, Priya.
- Bye. - Bye. - Bye.

294
00:20:46,345 --> 00:20:47,073
Bye, Priya.
- Bye. - Bye. - Bye.

295
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:09,791
What have you brought now?

296
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:13,535
l have not brought anything.

297
00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:15,607
l want my bagthat l
gave you in the morning.

298
00:21:19,578 --> 00:21:20,943
l ate that cake.

299
00:21:22,648 --> 00:21:23,706
You won't get anything.

300
00:21:24,249 --> 00:21:25,978
lt wasa big cake and
you ate up the whole thing?

301
00:21:28,253 --> 00:21:29,982
l had given you
that cake by mistake.

302
00:21:30,088 --> 00:21:33,922
Forget that cake and
run away from here.

303
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:36,055
l will not go back without my cake.

304
00:21:36,595 --> 00:21:37,755
You are lying.

305
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,563
You had kept it in this
bag in the morning, right?

306
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:48,573
lf you touch this bagagain,
l will break your hand.

307
00:21:48,674 --> 00:21:50,608
l will break this hand.
Run away from here. Run.

308
00:22:09,628 --> 00:22:10,652
Superman.

309
00:22:27,646 --> 00:22:29,307
Superman will never improve.

310
00:22:42,661 --> 00:22:43,923
Superman, you..

311
00:22:44,262 --> 00:22:45,991
This is called safe landing.

312
00:22:46,264 --> 00:22:47,697
You Pawan Hans (helicopter).

313
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,833
And on top of that, you're late.

314
00:22:50,669 --> 00:22:52,227
What can l do? l got
caught up in traffic.

315
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:55,305
Traffic?
- On my way, l saw Juhu beach.

316
00:22:55,407 --> 00:22:56,669
So, l ate somethingthere.

317
00:22:57,409 --> 00:22:59,809
Over here, Ravan
made Spiderman flee..

318
00:22:59,945 --> 00:23:02,072
..and you are worriedabout eating.

319
00:23:03,281 --> 00:23:04,805
Catwoman is right.

320
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:07,947
Ravan has decidedto lock
horns with us superheroes.

321
00:23:09,354 --> 00:23:12,152
We all will avenge this humiliation.

322
00:23:12,257 --> 00:23:14,088
Spiderman, give usan idea.

323
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,819
That bag has been
with him for 24 hours.

324
00:23:17,763 --> 00:23:19,788
The source of his
power is in his bag.

325
00:23:20,298 --> 00:23:23,825
He will lose his power
if we steal that bag.

326
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:25,999
Andthat is how we
will avenge our insult.

327
00:23:27,105 --> 00:23:30,666
We will keep a
24-hour watch on Ravan.

328
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:35,705
We will follow him like
a shadow every minute.

329
00:23:36,314 --> 00:23:38,680
Andthis will be a secret mission.

330
00:23:39,317 --> 00:23:41,683
We will always be in
different disguises.

331
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:44,381
He will never be
able to recognise us.

332
00:23:45,323 --> 00:23:48,190
He may get
misguided sooner or later.

333
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:51,054
And the bag will be in our custody.

334
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:16,812
''Anyone comes or goes, but
they cannot win against us.''

335
00:24:16,922 --> 00:24:21,723
''The one who locks horns with us
will lose or will get shattered.''

336
00:24:23,829 --> 00:24:28,732
''Whether he's running or hiding
his face, he will come after us.''

337
00:24:28,834 --> 00:24:33,396
''Staggering, faltering.
See how Ravan runsaway.''

338
00:24:33,505 --> 00:24:35,735
''Anyone comes, anyone goes.''

339
00:24:35,841 --> 00:24:37,900
''Anyone comes, anyone goes.''

340
00:24:47,786 --> 00:24:49,754
''Anyone comes, anyone goes.''

341
00:24:49,855 --> 00:24:52,187
''Anyone comes, anyone goes.''

342
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:54,758
''Anyone comes, anyone goes.''

343
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,851
''Anyone comes, anyone goes.''

344
00:25:02,067 --> 00:25:06,766
''We let him go today.
The time was good.''

345
00:25:06,872 --> 00:25:11,104
''But just be sure that
this doesn't occur everyday.''

346
00:25:11,409 --> 00:25:15,971
''We keep a watch on him today.''

347
00:25:16,214 --> 00:25:20,514
''Very soon, he too will
know how strong we are.''

348
00:25:20,819 --> 00:25:25,051
''We will teach him a lesson.''

349
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:30,052
''We will teach him a lesson
that he will never forget.''

350
00:25:51,316 --> 00:25:53,181
''Friends, do not get scared.''

351
00:25:53,285 --> 00:25:55,549
''Come. We will think together.''

352
00:25:55,854 --> 00:26:00,257
''We will do some planning together.''

353
00:26:00,458 --> 00:26:05,122
''So, today, we have
decided that we will win.''

354
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:09,326
''Yes. Yes. Yes.''

355
00:26:20,145 --> 00:26:21,942
Hey, come on. lce cream.

356
00:26:23,214 --> 00:26:24,238
Wow.

357
00:26:32,891 --> 00:26:37,225
''So what if our enemy is strong?''

358
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:41,593
''We are not weak either.
We are number one.''

359
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:46,867
''Whatever happens, this
mission must be carried out.''

360
00:26:46,972 --> 00:26:51,033
''How much ever he tries, he
cannot save himself from us.''

361
00:26:51,409 --> 00:26:55,869
''How long will he be
able to hide from us?''

362
00:26:56,114 --> 00:27:00,380
''One day, he will get trapped.''

363
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:03,181
''Hail Lord Ganesh.''

364
00:27:03,321 --> 00:27:04,948
''Hail Lord Ganesh.''

365
00:27:05,056 --> 00:27:06,546
''Hail Lord Ganesh.''

366
00:27:06,658 --> 00:27:08,182
''Hail Lord Ganesh.''

367
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:09,885
''Hail Lord Ganesh.''

368
00:27:09,995 --> 00:27:11,429
''Hail Lord Ganesh.''

369
00:27:11,429 --> 00:27:13,294
''Hail Lord Ganesh.''

370
00:27:13,932 --> 00:27:15,627
''Hail Lord Ganesh.''

371
00:27:15,934 --> 00:27:19,233
''Hail Lord Ganesh.''

372
00:27:19,337 --> 00:27:20,895
Please leave me. l
have not done anything.

373
00:27:21,006 --> 00:27:26,239
Please leave me. Please.
Please l.. Please leave me.

374
00:27:26,611 --> 00:27:29,603
Please leave me. Please leave me.

375
00:27:29,948 --> 00:27:30,972
Please..

376
00:27:35,954 --> 00:27:38,115
Hey, slowly. My hand
is hurt, isn't it?

377
00:27:38,623 --> 00:27:40,250
He caught your right hand.

378
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:43,256
Yes. What a dreadful plan.

379
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:44,928
We will steal his bag. Forget it.

380
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:46,224
Then why were you
delayed while running?

381
00:27:47,565 --> 00:27:49,931
This 250-kilo body is
attached to his hand..

382
00:27:50,035 --> 00:27:51,935
..that weighs two anda half kilos.

383
00:27:52,037 --> 00:27:54,028
Hey, Karan, make her understand.

384
00:27:54,239 --> 00:27:57,208
Good morning, students.
- Good morning, ma'am.

385
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:59,943
Okay, today, group Aand
group B will share their..

386
00:28:00,045 --> 00:28:01,478
..projects with us.

387
00:28:01,713 --> 00:28:03,305
We will start with Rohan. Come.

388
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:11,955
These igloosare
made from ice blocks.

389
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:15,956
lce is easily found in
areas like the Arctic circle.

390
00:28:16,394 --> 00:28:19,056
And ice is the best
insulator in cold weather.

391
00:28:19,264 --> 00:28:22,199
The shape is circular so that
the falling snow slides away..

392
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:23,597
..and does not accumulate on it.

393
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:25,969
Very good. Neeta, come.

394
00:28:26,071 --> 00:28:27,095
Yes, ma'am.

395
00:28:28,406 --> 00:28:29,964
Good. Come.

396
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:36,577
This house is made from bamboos.

397
00:28:36,748 --> 00:28:39,979
Bamboosare very light,
yet very strong.

398
00:28:40,085 --> 00:28:43,179
ln hilly regions like Assam,
there is very heavy rain.

399
00:28:43,288 --> 00:28:46,121
To protect these houses
from floods, these houses..

400
00:28:46,424 --> 00:28:48,984
..are made ten feet
above the ground level.

401
00:28:49,427 --> 00:28:50,451
Very good, Neeta.

402
00:28:51,429 --> 00:28:55,058
Children, did you see? The way a
bird builds its nest on the tree..

403
00:28:55,166 --> 00:28:57,327
ln the same way, we,
human beings too sometimes..

404
00:28:57,435 --> 00:29:00,370
..build our housesat a
height to protect ourselves.

405
00:29:02,774 --> 00:29:07,438
Give me an idea for the school
project. l am really very tense.

406
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:11,340
You are being tensed as if
you are doing everythingalone.

407
00:29:12,784 --> 00:29:14,684
Today, ma'am was looking very fair.

408
00:29:15,053 --> 00:29:16,281
Which cream do you
think she might be using?

409
00:29:16,654 --> 00:29:18,053
She must be usinga toothpaste.

410
00:29:18,189 --> 00:29:19,383
Oh, my God, so fair.

411
00:29:19,491 --> 00:29:21,186
Someone at least give me an idea.

412
00:29:21,326 --> 00:29:24,022
Hey, you..
- Why don't you make Ravan's hut?

413
00:29:24,229 --> 00:29:27,027
lt will be very easy. - Please.
Do not utter that Ravan's name.

414
00:29:27,132 --> 00:29:28,190
He has troubled me enough.

415
00:29:28,299 --> 00:29:29,323
Laddu..

416
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:30,458
Now, he will never trouble you.

417
00:29:34,072 --> 00:29:38,475
Look up. lf we make a
wooden house on this tree..

418
00:29:39,144 --> 00:29:42,045
..then from that
height we can keep a watch..

419
00:29:42,147 --> 00:29:43,341
..on Ravan for 24 hours.

420
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:46,443
This tree house
will be our base camp.

421
00:29:46,751 --> 00:29:49,151
Andthat Ravan will
never be able to catch us.

422
00:29:51,756 --> 00:29:54,384
But where will we get the
woodto make this tree house?

423
00:29:55,093 --> 00:29:57,084
Andthen, how will we
make this tree house?

424
00:29:57,362 --> 00:29:58,624
Do you know anything?

425
00:29:59,364 --> 00:30:00,797
We will steal the
woodfrom the site.

426
00:30:01,499 --> 00:30:03,262
You just keep watching.

427
00:30:40,405 --> 00:30:42,100
Hey. What is the problem up there?

428
00:30:42,273 --> 00:30:43,797
l am coming. l am coming upstairs.

429
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:45,734
Why are you breakingthings?

430
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:47,106
The boss then reprimands me.

431
00:30:47,545 --> 00:30:49,740
l won't spare you if
there isany damage.

432
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:51,577
Yes.
- l will not spare anyone.

433
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:53,174
l am coming.

434
00:30:53,751 --> 00:30:55,275
l will not spare.
l will not spare anyone.

435
00:30:58,556 --> 00:31:01,218
Not a single worker is of use.
l have to look after everything.

436
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:02,583
Useless.

437
00:31:36,194 --> 00:31:38,662
Hey, you. Who dropped these planks?

438
00:31:39,197 --> 00:31:42,166
l don't know, sir.
When we came here..

439
00:31:42,267 --> 00:31:43,291
..the planks hadalready fallen.

440
00:31:44,869 --> 00:31:46,496
We have come here to apply cement.

441
00:31:46,804 --> 00:31:49,170
Great, Ram. This is good news.

442
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:52,175
Today, you are working
without being askedto.

443
00:31:52,477 --> 00:31:54,342
Okay, arrange the planks
upon finishing your work.

444
00:31:54,479 --> 00:31:55,503
Okay? Yes.

445
00:31:57,682 --> 00:32:00,276
How come this boy has new shoes?

446
00:32:03,821 --> 00:32:04,879
Let me see who he is?

447
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:09,758
Sir, shall l start my work now?

448
00:32:10,228 --> 00:32:11,252
Yes, yes, why are you asking me?

449
00:32:11,629 --> 00:32:14,189
Hey, when l saw the shoes
l thought they looked new.

450
00:32:14,299 --> 00:32:15,732
l think l have some
problem with my eyes.

451
00:32:19,304 --> 00:32:21,602
The thing is that we want some wood.

452
00:32:22,507 --> 00:32:24,202
Actually, we are
makinga tree house.

453
00:32:24,309 --> 00:32:25,333
What are you making?

454
00:32:25,977 --> 00:32:27,808
Atree house. Ahouse on a tree.

455
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:30,209
Have you been thrown
out of the house..

456
00:32:30,315 --> 00:32:31,339
..that you want to stay on the tree?

457
00:32:31,716 --> 00:32:33,547
l will make your hut in two days.

458
00:32:33,718 --> 00:32:35,549
Hey, no. We do not
want to live on the tree.

459
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:37,220
Actually, the beggar staying..

460
00:32:38,256 --> 00:32:40,224
l mean, the Doberman
that stays in the bungalow..

461
00:32:40,325 --> 00:32:41,349
..opposite to us..

462
00:32:41,526 --> 00:32:43,460
We are makinga tree
house to keep a watch on him.

463
00:32:43,995 --> 00:32:46,327
l know that you keep a
watch on that beggar.

464
00:32:46,998 --> 00:32:49,228
How do you know? Who told you?

465
00:32:49,534 --> 00:32:51,229
l have been watching
the drama going on..

466
00:32:51,336 --> 00:32:52,496
..between you andthat
beggar since the past three days.

467
00:32:53,271 --> 00:32:55,364
You do not know, but
that beggar is very cunning.

468
00:32:57,275 --> 00:32:58,299
Okay, forget about all that.

469
00:32:58,409 --> 00:33:01,242
You were saying that you
can make a hut for me?

470
00:33:01,546 --> 00:33:05,346
Hut? Think that the plan for
this ten-storied building is mine.

471
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:07,341
What does Gupta know?

472
00:33:08,686 --> 00:33:10,347
l want to be an
architect when l grow up.

473
00:33:14,292 --> 00:33:16,590
Join our team. lt will be great fun.

474
00:33:24,035 --> 00:33:25,263
Hey, move.

475
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:28,597
This is Ram. lf he
would not have saved me..

476
00:33:28,706 --> 00:33:29,730
..then Gupta would have..

477
00:33:31,042 --> 00:33:33,442
Andfor him, it is child's
play to make a tree house.

478
00:33:37,815 --> 00:33:43,276
The building has ten floors, but
this tree is.. just one floor.

479
00:33:43,988 --> 00:33:48,288
According to me, we
will need rope, bamboos..

480
00:33:48,393 --> 00:33:50,452
..and five more planks.

481
00:33:53,331 --> 00:33:55,822
lf he is going to climb,
then we will needten planks.

482
00:33:58,403 --> 00:33:59,427
Go away.

483
00:34:00,338 --> 00:34:01,430
So, come. Shall we start the work?

484
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:02,665
Yes.
- Come on.

485
00:34:04,008 --> 00:34:05,305
Yes.

486
00:34:09,947 --> 00:34:11,039
Yes.

487
00:34:40,378 --> 00:34:48,911
''There should be a cool
shade of multi-coloured dreams.''

488
00:34:49,654 --> 00:34:58,084
''There should be a place to
make happinessandto be happy.''

489
00:34:58,796 --> 00:35:02,857
''Our house will be
unique and beautiful.''

490
00:35:03,401 --> 00:35:07,360
''Our house will be
the apple of our eyes.''

491
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:16,847
''lt should be such an abode
where we can do what we wish.''

492
00:35:45,443 --> 00:35:53,908
''lt should be unique,
but very simple.''

493
00:35:54,719 --> 00:36:03,127
''There should be
neither roof nor any walls.''

494
00:36:03,861 --> 00:36:08,423
''The birds should come
and sing. The branches.. ''

495
00:36:08,533 --> 00:36:12,435
''..and the leaves
should provide shadow.''

496
00:36:12,603 --> 00:36:16,539
''Our house will be
unique and beautiful.''

497
00:36:17,074 --> 00:36:21,033
''Our house will be
the apple of our eyes.''

498
00:36:21,746 --> 00:36:30,814
''lt should be such an abode
where we can do what we wish.''

499
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:40,454
''There should be a cool
shade of multi-coloured dreams.''

500
00:37:06,123 --> 00:37:14,622
''We will keep a watch on everyone.''

501
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:23,766
''We will take everyone to task now.''

502
00:37:24,542 --> 00:37:32,950
''Now, where will our enemy go? He
will definitely be taught a lesson.''

503
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:37,109
''Our house will be
unique and beautiful.''

504
00:37:37,822 --> 00:37:41,758
''Our house will be
the apple of our eyes.''

505
00:37:42,293 --> 00:37:51,531
''lt should be such an abode
where we can do what we wish.''

506
00:37:51,636 --> 00:38:00,135
''There should be a cool
shade of multi-coloured dreams.''

507
00:38:00,845 --> 00:38:09,549
''There should be a place to
make happinessandto be happy.''

508
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,988
Gopala. Gopala. Gopala.

509
00:38:52,096 --> 00:38:53,120

Gopala. Gopala. Gopala.

516
00:39:08,245 --> 00:39:09,940
Where is our coconut

517
00:39:10,047 --> 00:39:16,748

00:39:42,012 --> 00:39:43,240

them in coconut oil..

524
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:49,049
..and brought the fingers
of your old enemy, Hari Om.

525
00:39:51,422 --> 00:39:54,118
Gopala. Gopala. Gopala.

526
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:55,852
He used to raise this
finger at me, right?

527
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:58,260
Can anyone defeat Sarkar (Big boss)?

528
00:39:59,964 --> 00:40:00,988
That idiot..

529
00:40:01,966 --> 00:40:04,400
Gopala. Gopala. Gopala.

530
00:40:04,969 --> 00:40:06,664
Great. Lovely, Krishna lyer.

531
00:40:07,438 --> 00:40:09,065
Hey, our brother Laddu too has come.

532
00:40:09,306 --> 00:40:10,330
Come.

533
00:40:11,442 --> 00:40:15,401
Brother Laddu greets
everyone in the court of Sarkar.

534
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:17,140
Here is the full payment.

535
00:40:17,848 --> 00:40:19,281
Mona darling, open the bag.

536
00:40:26,791 --> 00:40:29,419
Take all this money
and give me my goods.

537
00:40:36,333 --> 00:40:39,734
That means that your men
could not bring Ravan's bag?

538
00:40:40,871 --> 00:40:43,704
Look here. Look here,
Brother Laddu, we were trying.

539
00:40:44,141 --> 00:40:45,904
But instead, he barged
into our tree house.

540
00:40:46,877 --> 00:40:48,708
ln Mumbai, the moment
people see empty space..

541
00:40:48,813 --> 00:40:50,303
..they immediately
start occupying it.

542
00:40:50,815 --> 00:40:52,976
Sarkar,just order me.

543
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:55,250
l will immediately
go and kill Ravan.

544
00:40:55,352 --> 00:40:56,376
Yes, yes, go and kill him.

545
00:40:56,487 --> 00:40:58,114
Hey. Do not talk rubbish.

546
00:40:58,889 --> 00:41:00,049
Has your Dubai visa arrived?

547
00:41:02,359 --> 00:41:03,383
No.

548
00:41:03,494 --> 00:41:05,462
Where will you go after
killing him? - Yes. Yes.

549
00:41:06,897 --> 00:41:08,728
Look here, you had promised me.

550
00:41:08,899 --> 00:41:10,730
We will make a tree house.
We will keep a watch.

551
00:41:10,835 --> 00:41:11,927
We will get the bag.

552
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:14,271
Brother Laddu, please
give us some more time.

553
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:17,940
Boss, when will this
item girl be of use?

554
00:41:18,242 --> 00:41:19,732
Just yesterday, l gave an audition..

555
00:41:19,844 --> 00:41:21,471
..for Ram Gopal Verma's film.

556
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:25,881
l will dance and distract
him and you can steal his bag.

557
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:34,757
Hey. Hey, wait. Wait.

558
00:41:35,526 --> 00:41:36,754
Stop it.

559
00:41:39,129 --> 00:41:40,494
We will have to
think of some other idea.

560
00:41:43,534 --> 00:41:45,502
Anna, tell me your idea.

561
00:42:14,899 --> 00:42:16,127
Come. Come quickly. Come on.

562
00:42:16,433 --> 00:42:17,457
Let's go.

563
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:21,455
Come. Come.

564
00:43:21,565 --> 00:43:22,589
Yes.
- Yes.

565
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:25,596
Yes.
- Yes.

566
00:43:37,047 --> 00:43:39,607
Ram, your idea was very good.
- Yes.

567
00:43:42,653 --> 00:43:44,621
How he ran away.

568
00:43:45,055 --> 00:43:47,615
Ravan, you are
locking horns with us?

569
00:43:47,925 --> 00:43:48,949
What else could l be doing?

570
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:50,888
Where are you going?

571
00:43:51,195 --> 00:43:52,890
That water tanker has come.

572
00:43:53,397 --> 00:43:54,421
l will have to make a
drama in front of Gupta..

573
00:43:54,531 --> 00:43:55,623
..by wateringthe place.

574
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:57,624
Okay, l am going.
- Okay, bye.

575
00:43:57,935 --> 00:43:59,232
Yes.
- Yes, come on. - Hey, you.

576
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:01,035
Bye.
- Okay, go now.

577
00:44:07,678 --> 00:44:09,646
l told you he has
weapons in his bag.

578
00:44:10,014 --> 00:44:11,038
Look.

579
00:44:13,684 --> 00:44:15,515
He is sharpening
that knife on the stone.

580
00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:21,521
He will definitely
take revenge against us.

581
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:25,658
Oh. He is coming here. Look.

582
00:44:25,963 --> 00:44:26,987
Let me see.

583
00:44:30,968 --> 00:44:32,959
Oh, l hope he does not come up.

584
00:44:33,704 --> 00:44:35,672
There is only one way to
come up on the tree house.

585
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:39,066
lf he comes up from the ladder then
we will push Laddu down. - Hey, you.

586
00:44:39,243 --> 00:44:41,541
Couldanyone bear his
weight till today? - No.

587
00:45:05,335 --> 00:45:06,427
Where did he vanish?

588
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:19,239
Look there.

589
00:45:31,762 --> 00:45:35,061
Look at that coward. He did
not have courage to come up.

590
00:45:35,365 --> 00:45:37,333
What couldthat box contain?

591
00:45:38,769 --> 00:45:39,997
l hope he has not kept a bomb.

592
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:43,733
Nowadays, they show so
many bomb blasts in the news.

593
00:45:45,309 --> 00:45:47,402
No. He wants to sleep here.

594
00:45:47,778 --> 00:45:50,406
lf he blasts the tree house with a
bomb, then what will he do at night?

595
00:45:55,652 --> 00:45:56,744
Just see how he is smiling?

596
00:45:57,588 --> 00:45:59,613
l think Ravan has gone mad.

597
00:46:00,791 --> 00:46:03,419
Oh. Cockroach.

598
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:05,755
Mummy. Help me.

599
00:46:06,463 --> 00:46:10,365
Oh. Cockroach.

600
00:46:11,135 --> 00:46:12,625
Run. Cockroach.

601
00:46:12,736 --> 00:46:14,761
Ram, save us.

602
00:46:15,139 --> 00:46:17,767
How will we go down now?

603
00:46:19,143 --> 00:46:20,576
Cockroach.

604
00:46:20,677 --> 00:46:21,701
Help us.

605
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:27,777
Ram, spray the water on top.

606
00:46:44,168 --> 00:46:45,795
Ravan turned out to be very smart.

607
00:46:46,837 --> 00:46:48,464
We will have to
teach him a big lesson.

608
00:46:48,772 --> 00:46:51,468
Did you not enjoy getting wet?

609
00:46:51,775 --> 00:46:54,073
l always have a bath with
the water from the tanker.

610
00:46:54,378 --> 00:46:56,209
That is a different matter.

611
00:46:57,247 --> 00:46:58,612
Ravan has challenged us.

612
00:46:59,449 --> 00:47:01,542
We will have to attack his Lanka.

613
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:03,343
Hey. Hey.

614
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:06,812
He isattacking us
in broad daylight.

615
00:47:08,725 --> 00:47:09,817
Have you gone crazy?

616
00:47:13,197 --> 00:47:15,631
Go away. Go away.

617
00:47:15,799 --> 00:47:18,233
Karan, l am scared of dogs.

618
00:47:19,136 --> 00:47:21,366
l have fooled
Dracula plenty of times.

619
00:47:22,272 --> 00:47:27,437
Go. Go.

620
00:47:28,412 --> 00:47:30,380
Don't get scared. He is just a dog.

621
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:31,640
Why should you get
frightened of a dog?

622
00:47:39,156 --> 00:47:41,124
Karan, he is just a dog. Why
should you be frightened..

623
00:47:41,225 --> 00:47:42,715
..of a dog?

624
00:47:44,494 --> 00:47:46,587
Come up quickly.
- Run.

625
00:47:47,898 --> 00:47:50,867
Karan, come up quickly.
Come on. Come up quickly.

626
00:48:15,792 --> 00:48:17,692
l am less dangerous than a dog.

627
00:48:18,662 --> 00:48:21,563
Come, sit here. Do not
get wet in the rain.

628
00:48:28,939 --> 00:48:30,566
Because of you, we
got caught in the rain.

629
00:48:31,341 --> 00:48:32,569
Why are you so scared of dogs?

630
00:48:32,876 --> 00:48:33,900
Are you not scared?

631
00:48:35,279 --> 00:48:39,306
Yes. You get scared
only of cockroaches.

632
00:48:39,616 --> 00:48:41,311
Why did you leave
cockroaches on our tree house?

633
00:48:41,685 --> 00:48:42,913
Why did you stir up
smoke with red chillies?

634
00:48:43,353 --> 00:48:46,789
How can you sleep here?
This tree house is ours.

635
00:48:47,557 --> 00:48:49,718
Take the rent for this house.
- No, no.

636
00:48:49,826 --> 00:48:52,454
We do not want any rent.
Just don't come here.

637
00:48:53,630 --> 00:48:55,222
lt is just a question
of sleeping at night.

638
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:58,326
When l sleep there, the
police hit me with their sticks.

639
00:48:59,369 --> 00:49:01,735
The municipality
people tear down my hut.

640
00:49:02,372 --> 00:49:04,932
l do not have a proper
house like you all do, right?

641
00:49:05,375 --> 00:49:07,741
So? Even l do not
have a proper house.

642
00:49:07,911 --> 00:49:09,208
But l do not sleep here.

643
00:49:09,579 --> 00:49:11,206
What do you mean? You
do not have a house?

644
00:49:11,515 --> 00:49:12,948
Your house is behind
that building, right?

645
00:49:15,252 --> 00:49:18,744
Aproper house is not made by
just five to ten tin sheets.

646
00:49:19,923 --> 00:49:21,618
The day this building is complete..

647
00:49:21,992 --> 00:49:23,960
When all the flatsare ready..

648
00:49:25,329 --> 00:49:26,956
That day, our house will be broken.

649
00:49:27,931 --> 00:49:28,955
That is our job.

650
00:49:30,267 --> 00:49:34,829
We make homes for othersand
then our house gets broken.

651
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:39,241
But this tree house
is much stronger..

652
00:49:39,343 --> 00:49:40,367
..than my hut.

653
00:49:40,877 --> 00:49:42,310
This tree will not move from here.

654
00:50:02,499 --> 00:50:04,990
Come on, play.
- Throw it.

655
00:50:06,503 --> 00:50:07,595
Throw it.
-Throw.

656
00:50:09,373 --> 00:50:14,606
Oh, no.
- Yes. This is.. balanced.

657
00:50:15,579 --> 00:50:17,945
And this is 50 now. Come on, play.

658
00:50:21,451 --> 00:50:23,544
TV. Gas oils.

659
00:50:25,055 --> 00:50:26,545
Come on, throw.
- Oh, my God.

660
00:50:26,923 --> 00:50:28,948
Throw.
- Poltro. Yes.

661
00:50:29,059 --> 00:50:30,287
Ritesh. Laddu.

662
00:50:30,994 --> 00:50:32,291
Hey, go away.
- Go away.

663
00:50:32,729 --> 00:50:33,753
50.
- 15..

664
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:35,695
Karan. Come here. Quickly.

665
00:50:36,733 --> 00:50:38,030
20. Put 20 here.

666
00:50:38,468 --> 00:50:39,560
l love rain.

667
00:51:26,049 --> 00:51:27,073
Come.

668
00:51:29,653 --> 00:51:32,486
This is my hut. l can sleep here.

669
00:51:36,393 --> 00:51:40,955
We all have decidedthat you can
sleep in our tree house at night.

670
00:51:43,133 --> 00:51:45,363
But do not feel that
we are scared of you.

671
00:51:45,602 --> 00:51:48,765
Whenever we tell you, you will
have to vacate the tree house.

672
00:51:49,005 --> 00:51:50,097
And do not sleep till
late in the morning.

673
00:51:50,674 --> 00:51:51,698
Do you agree?

674
00:51:52,609 --> 00:51:53,633
l agree.

675
00:51:53,810 --> 00:51:56,370
And yes, at night, you
will have to guard it too.

676
00:51:58,682 --> 00:52:00,775
How can l keep a watch if l sleep?

677
00:52:03,553 --> 00:52:04,577
Yes. Okay, fine.

678
00:52:04,821 --> 00:52:06,846
That tree house is
yours from tonight.

679
00:52:07,757 --> 00:52:09,725
Oh.
- What are you doing?

680
00:52:09,826 --> 00:52:12,124
Sorry. Sorry.
- Sorry. - Sorry.

681
00:52:12,696 --> 00:52:13,720
Sorry.

682
00:52:23,039 --> 00:52:25,473
Come on, hurry up. Boss

686
00:52:40,590 --> 00:52:41,614
Yes, Mr. Bakshi. See this.

687
00:52:46,796 --> 00:52:48,161
Bakshi Constructions.

688
00:52:48,798 --> 00:52:50,163
Build your nest today.

689
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:54,161
l use nature in my
publicity because we love nature.

690
00:52:54,471 --> 00:52:55,768
Good. -Thank you. -
Very good. - Thank you.

691
00:52:55,872 --> 00:52:56,964
This is very natural.

692
00:52:57,073 --> 00:52:58,631
Mr. Gupta. Mr. Gupta, we
have finished our work.

693

Mr. Gupta, can you see the hoarding?

00:53:06,550 --> 00:53:07,574
Yes, sir.

697
00:53:08,084 --> 00:53:10,177
Dumb fool. Come here. Come here.

698
00:53:10,887 --> 00:53:12,445
Any problem, sir?
- Quiet. Quiet.

699
00:53:12,889 --> 00:53:16,188
Hey.. hey, child. Can
you see any hoarding here?

700
00:53:16,493 --> 00:53:17,517
Can you see it?

701
00:53:19,162 --> 00:53:20,186
No.
- No.

702
00:53:20,964 --> 00:53:23,455
Did you see? Publicity is
that which can be seen..

703
00:53:23,567 --> 00:53:24,864
..from all the sides.

704
00:53:24,968 --> 00:53:26,663
The public should be
able to see it. - Yes, sir.

705
00:53:26,770 --> 00:53:28,533
What is this in front of us?
- Nature, sir.

706
00:53:28,638 --> 00:53:30,128
Yes, we love nature.
But cut off this tree.

707
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:31,537
Cut it. Cut it. Remove it.
- Okay, sir.

708
00:53:31,641 --> 00:53:33,074
Hey. Hey. Come here.
- Yes, sir.

709
00:53:33,176 --> 00:53:34,200
Cut this branch from here.

710
00:53:34,511 --> 00:53:35,944
Cut the branch from here.
- Up. Up.

711
00:53:36,046 --> 00:53:37,513
Gupta.
- Yes, sir. lt is done, sir.

712
00:53:37,614 --> 00:53:39,081
Come on, we have to cut
this tree. Take permission.

713
00:53:39,182 --> 00:53:40,206
This tree is on our site.

714
00:53:40,784 --> 00:53:41,808
Which site, sir?

715
00:53:41,918 --> 00:53:42,942
The one at Kandivali?

716
00:53:43,987 --> 00:53:45,011
Or the one at Nalla Sopara?

717
00:53:45,121 --> 00:53:46,213
You will again create a problem.

718
00:53:46,523 --> 00:53:47,547
You always create problems.

719
00:53:47,657 --> 00:53:48,885
Come. l will show you
which tree. Come on.

720
00:54:17,887 --> 00:54:18,911
Please come, sir.

721
00:54:19,022 --> 00:54:21,582
Hey, you, Gupta. This side.

722
00:54:22,292 --> 00:54:23,919
Now, you see
properly with your own eyes.

723
00:54:24,027 --> 00:54:25,790
This time you should not
make any mistakes. - Yes, sir.

724
00:54:26,162 --> 00:54:29,256
We will builda new gate
to come in from. From there.

725
00:54:29,566 --> 00:54:31,056
Sir, how can we make it here?

726
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:32,259
There isa tree in the way, sir.

727
00:54:33,236 --> 00:54:35,796
Very good. Very smart.
-Thank you, sir.

728
00:54:35,905 --> 00:54:37,532
You fool. That is why
l am telling you that..

729
00:54:37,641 --> 00:54:39,199
..this tree should be cut.

730
00:54:39,309 --> 00:54:41,277
This tree should vanish from here.

731
00:54:41,711 --> 00:54:42,735
Understood?
- Okay, sir.

732
00:54:55,592 --> 00:54:57,617
Do you know how to tie shoelace?

733
00:54:59,596 --> 00:55:01,029
How do you pass your time?

734
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:06,634
l have all the time l want.

735
00:55:07,337 --> 00:55:08,770
What is your real name?

736
00:55:11,007 --> 00:55:12,031
l don't remember.

737
00:55:12,876 --> 00:55:14,639
We will call you Ravan.

738
00:55:18,615 --> 00:55:20,583
But l have only one head.

739
00:55:21,751 --> 00:55:24,652
No problem, Ravan
isa nice name too?

740
00:55:24,754 --> 00:55:26,654
How many times in a
year do you take a bath?

741
00:55:28,224 --> 00:55:29,657
Do you use shampoo?

742
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:33,923
We are friends. We
are sharing everything.

743
00:55:34,297 --> 00:55:35,662
What's in your bag?

744
00:55:36,232 --> 00:55:37,665
You always carry it along.

745
00:55:40,103 --> 00:55:43,197
ln friendship, we only
share the tree-house.

746
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:46,608
Now, we won't even share that.

747
00:55:47,043 --> 00:55:49,603
He just sleeps in
it during the night.

748
00:55:49,713 --> 00:55:51,010
But the deck belongs to us.

749
00:55:54,984 --> 00:55:57,680
Now, this tree house
won't belongto anyone.

750
00:56:00,123 --> 00:56:03,615
''Mahabharat.''

751
00:56:11,134 --> 00:56:16,094
''The great story of
Mahabharat (an epic).''

752
00:56:16,206 --> 00:56:20,905
''The great story of Mahabharat.''

753
00:56:24,881 --> 00:56:28,977
Pandavas, you have
lost Draupadi to me.

754
00:56:29,285 --> 00:56:32,982
All your wealth, kingdom,
everything is indebted to me.

755
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:35,248
Dushasan.
- Yes sir.

756
00:56:35,358 --> 00:56:38,657
Disrobe Draupadi and
keep her in my truck.

757
00:56:38,762 --> 00:56:41,663
Duryodhan, you are
slandering Draupadi.

758
00:56:41,898 --> 00:56:44,264
Brother Yudhishthir,
with your permission..

759
00:56:44,701 --> 00:56:48,262
..l will shatter
Duryodhan's head into 100 pieces..

760
00:56:48,371 --> 00:56:49,861
..and feed it to 99 dogs.

761
00:56:51,307 --> 00:56:52,672
Why 99 dogs?

762
00:56:53,309 --> 00:56:55,743
Maybe one of the dogs will
eat two piecesasa bonus.

763
00:56:57,247 --> 00:57:01,081
Hey. There is no
needto act too smart.

764
00:57:01,718 --> 00:57:05,154
Go, and disrobe Draupadi.

765
00:57:05,722 --> 00:57:07,212
Gladly, sir.

766
00:57:07,323 --> 00:57:11,885
Dushasan, fool,
idiot, l will kill you.

767
00:57:12,729 --> 00:57:14,697
Why me? Kill him.
He is up for grabs.

768
00:57:15,465 --> 00:57:17,763
Up for grabs.
- l mean, it's easy to kill him.

769
00:57:17,867 --> 00:57:19,767
Can be done by anyone.

770
00:57:23,072 --> 00:57:26,166
l will kill you right here.
- Sorry, sir.

771
00:57:26,342 --> 00:57:29,971
Go. Go. Go, and disrobe Draupadi.

772
00:57:33,883 --> 00:57:37,182
Sahdev, we have lost Draupadi.

773
00:57:43,026 --> 00:57:44,050
You.

774
00:57:47,430 --> 00:57:52,458
Even l have taken shelter
under the shade of this tree.

775
00:57:54,170 --> 00:57:58,732
And you hadasked me
to look after this tree.

776
00:58:00,777 --> 00:58:05,077
So, l am your
pathfinder in this war.

777
00:58:32,008 --> 00:58:33,771
Dushasan.

778
00:58:34,544 --> 00:58:37,172
You idiot. Get up. Get up.

779
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:38,845
Sir, in Sanskrit. ln Sanskrit.

780
00:58:42,485 --> 00:58:44,248
You have won this time.

781
00:58:44,821 --> 00:58:47,187
But l won't spare a
single branch of this tree..

782
00:58:47,824 --> 00:58:50,122
..or my name isn't Duryodhan.

783
00:58:52,295 --> 00:58:54,855
There are no empty plots in Mumbai.

784
00:58:55,164 --> 00:58:57,792
Do one thing, get me a graveyard..

785
00:58:57,901 --> 00:58:58,993
..and l will build a tower on that.

786
00:58:59,903 --> 00:59:00,927
Gupta.

787
00:59:01,104 --> 00:59:03,265
Has the slab been erected on
the phase two of my building?

788
00:59:04,841 --> 00:59:07,810
And, have you collected all
the documents from the BMC?

789
00:59:08,244 --> 00:59:10,872
l hadtalked to the officer,
hadtaken care of everythingtoo.

790
00:59:11,848 --> 00:59:12,872
What is this?

791
00:59:12,982 --> 00:59:14,006
Say something.

792
00:59:14,851 --> 00:59:16,819
Sir. Sir, l am very hungry.

793
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:18,012
Can l get something to eat?

794
00:59:18,855 --> 00:59:20,880
Get lost. Don't
you see, sir is busy.

795
00:59:20,990 --> 00:59:22,548
Throw him out from here.
- Get out.

796
00:59:24,460 --> 00:59:28,089
Gupta. This tree will be cut down.

797
00:59:28,531 --> 00:59:30,089
We will build
another gate from here.

798
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,093
The railway station and
the market will be closer..

799
00:59:33,202 --> 00:59:35,363
..and the rates of my
building will go up.

800
00:59:35,872 --> 00:59:37,567
Whether Mumbai
becomes Shanghai or not..

801
00:59:37,874 --> 00:59:41,173
..but the rates of my
building will be more than New York.

802
00:59:41,544 --> 00:59:43,978
Sir, please give
me something to eat.

803
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:45,504
Get lost from here.

804
00:59:45,615 --> 00:59:46,843
Sir doesn't have anything.

805
00:59:46,950 --> 00:59:48,850
He doesn't have anything?
- He doesn't have anything. Nothing.

806
00:59:48,952 --> 00:59:51,113
Then come along, we
will beg together.

807
00:59:52,555 --> 00:59:53,579
Not a bad idea, sir.

808
00:59:54,023 --> 00:59:55,047
Business prospect, new.

809
00:59:55,158 --> 00:59:56,523
Shut up you idiot, throw him away.

810
00:59:56,626 --> 00:59:57,854
Shut up. Run away from here.

811
00:59:58,895 --> 01:00:01,864
Sir, actually there is a
problem with this tree.

812
01:00:02,231 --> 01:00:03,459
lf it is about the permission..

813
01:00:03,566 --> 01:00:04,863
..then to hell with the permission.

814
01:00:04,968 --> 01:00:08,267
Look, yesterday, we felled
a tree on the road. - Yes.

815
01:00:09,372 --> 01:00:11,932
Did we have permission for it?
- Yes.

816
01:00:12,575 --> 01:00:16,067
But didthe people
on the road stop by..

817
01:00:16,179 --> 01:00:17,942
..and ask us for the permission?
- No, sir.

818
01:00:18,047 --> 01:00:20,140
These days, the
people are so tensed..

819
01:00:20,249 --> 01:00:21,944
..who caresabout one tree.

820
01:00:22,118 --> 01:00:25,554
Cut this tree tomorrow morning,
understood? - Yes, sir.

821
01:00:25,655 --> 01:00:27,486
Now, with your permission,
l will cut down the tree tomorrow.

822
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:32,894
Come on. We have to cut
that tree today. - Yes.

823
01:00:33,529 --> 01:00:34,553
Yes.

824
01:00:34,664 --> 01:00:35,892
Run fast.

825
01:00:35,999 --> 01:00:37,432
Come on, Tony.
- You are the first one.

826
01:00:37,533 --> 01:00:38,557
Come on, run.
- Come on.

827
01:00:38,668 --> 01:00:39,896
Come on.
- You will win the gold medal.

828
01:00:40,003 --> 01:00:41,027
Come on.
- Go, Tony, go.

829
01:00:41,671 --> 01:00:43,298
ls it someone's birthday today?

830
01:00:44,007 --> 01:00:45,907
They seem to be
distributing free food on the road.

831
01:00:46,609 --> 01:00:47,906
Why are you standing there?

832
01:00:48,277 --> 01:00:50,438
Come here.
- Yes. - Come on, come, come.

833
01:00:50,546 --> 01:00:51,570
What are you doing?
The gate is that way.

834
01:00:51,681 --> 01:00:52,909
What is it?
- What is it?

835
01:00:53,016 --> 01:00:54,040
Take this sticker.
- Marathon. - Marathon.

836
01:00:54,150 --> 01:00:55,174
What are you doing?

837
01:00:55,284 --> 01:00:57,377
Marathon. Marathon.

838
01:00:57,487 --> 01:00:59,921
Eat these snacks, and
drink these cold drinks.

839
01:01:00,023 --> 01:01:01,251
Why?
-They are absolutely free.

840
01:01:01,357 --> 01:01:02,915
They are free.
-Absolutely free.

841
01:01:03,026 --> 01:01:04,323
Then take some more.
Take some more. -Take it.

842
01:01:04,427 --> 01:01:06,918
The tree.. - Forget about the tree,
we are getting this for free.

843
01:01:08,965 --> 01:01:09,989
Give me another glass.

844
01:01:10,099 --> 01:01:13,068
One more.
- Have some more. Have some more.

845
01:01:13,169 --> 01:01:14,932
Move.
- Come on, come on. You can do it.

846
01:01:15,038 --> 01:01:16,596
Come on.

847

You will win the silver medal.

848
01:01:19,042 --> 01:01:21,203
Yes, you will win the silver medal.

849
01:01:21,310 --> 01:01:22,402
Marathon.

850
01:01:22,512 --> 01:01:23,945
He looks just like the one earlier.

851
01:01:24,047 --> 01:01:25,674
l will slap you. Eat quietly.

852
01:01:26,249 --> 01:01:27,944
You are getting it for free,
but still you are acting smart.

853
01:01:28,051 --> 01:01:29,951
Will you just keep standing here?

854
01:01:30,053 --> 01:01:32,351
Go, run. You have to
win the marathon. - Run.

855
01:01:32,455 --> 01:01:33,547
But, where do we have to run to?

856
01:01:34,390 --> 01:01:36,688
You ate from this stall,
didn't you? - Yes.

857
01:01:38,327 --> 01:01:40,420
That means you both
are in the marathon now.

858
01:01:40,663 --> 01:01:42,028
You will find many
more stalls ahead.

859
01:01:42,398 --> 01:01:43,956
You will get free food there.
- What? - Yes.

860
01:01:44,067 --> 01:01:45,500
We will get free food ahead.

861
01:01:45,601 --> 01:01:48,365
lf we don't go to work,
then the boss will thrash us.

862
01:01:48,738 --> 01:01:50,968
There are only two
people ahead of you.

863
01:01:51,074 --> 01:01:52,371
lf you win the bronze medal..

864
01:01:52,475 --> 01:01:53,635
..then everyone will
be happy with you.

865
01:01:53,743 --> 01:01:54,971
Bronze medal.
- Yes.

866
01:01:55,078 --> 01:01:56,375
Free food. Bronze medal.
- Go on.

867
01:01:56,479 --> 01:01:57,639
Sir will be happy.

868
01:01:57,747 --> 01:01:59,305
Come on.
- Go on, run. Run.

869
01:01:59,415 --> 01:02:02,509
We will win.
- Come on. - Marathon.

870
01:02:03,219 --> 01:02:06,518
Marathon.
- Where are you going?

871
01:02:06,622 --> 01:02:07,987
Marathon. Bronze medal.

872
01:02:08,091 --> 01:02:09,456
We were running towards the tree.

873
01:02:09,759 --> 01:02:10,987
The gate is that way.

874
01:02:11,761 --> 01:02:13,592
Yes. We were
running towards that way.

875
01:02:13,763 --> 01:02:14,991
Actually, we were going that way.

876
01:02:15,098 --> 01:02:17,999
These children are not letting us.

877
01:02:18,434 --> 01:02:20,061
Which children?
-These children.

878
01:02:20,703 --> 01:02:21,727
What is it?

879
01:02:22,238 --> 01:02:23,330
Why are you not lettingthem go?

880
01:02:23,573 --> 01:02:25,541
So, are you not in the marathon?

881
01:02:25,641 --> 01:02:26,665
We are tree-cutters.

882
01:02:26,776 --> 01:02:28,676
Marathon. Bronze medal.
- Quiet.

883
01:02:29,712 --> 01:02:31,680
lt's surprising, Uncle.
- They are wearing such clothes..

884
01:02:31,781 --> 01:02:33,476
..we thought they too
are in the marathon.

885
01:02:34,050 --> 01:02:36,416
That's why we gave them
snacksand cold drinks.

886
01:02:36,719 --> 01:02:38,687
By the way, the snacks
and drinks are free.

887
01:02:38,788 --> 01:02:41,018
Have some.
- Yes, have some.

888
01:02:41,124 --> 01:02:43,092
Take it.
- lt's good. Thank you. Thank you.

889
01:02:53,336 --> 01:02:54,496
Come on, get back to work.

890
01:02:54,737 --> 01:02:55,761
Come on.

891
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:06,776
Thank God. We managed
to escape from Gupta.

892
01:03:10,153 --> 01:03:11,586
Come on, Laddu. Come on.

893
01:03:11,687 --> 01:03:14,121
Come on. Another round.

894
01:03:14,223 --> 01:03:15,588
Here, drink this cold drink.
- Come on.

895
01:03:15,691 --> 01:03:17,056
Come on. Please.

896
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:19,060
Come on, Laddu.

897
01:03:19,162 --> 01:03:21,528
Come on. You can do it.

898
01:03:27,236 --> 01:03:29,067
Hey, you. lf you would have
hada cold drink from the stall..

899
01:03:29,172 --> 01:03:31,606
..then you wouldn't
have behaved like this.

900
01:03:31,774 --> 01:03:33,674
Karan asked me not to drink any.

901
01:03:33,776 --> 01:03:35,471
Have l ever let such a
chance go from my hands?

902
01:03:36,512 --> 01:03:38,070
Karan, you
distributedfree cold drinks..

903
01:03:38,181 --> 01:03:42,140
..to others, instead of
our own team. - Correct.

904
01:03:42,385 --> 01:03:43,409
Quiet.

905
01:03:44,453 --> 01:03:47,286
Our plan, to shoo away
the cutters has failed.

906
01:03:47,857 --> 01:03:49,552
How will we save the tree now?

907
01:03:51,794 --> 01:03:52,818
Hello.

908
01:03:53,262 --> 01:03:54,286
Yes, Bakshi sir.

909
01:03:55,331 --> 01:03:56,423
No, the goods have arrived.

910
01:03:57,533 --> 01:03:58,830
Now, l have taken
the delivery myself.

911
01:03:59,402 --> 01:04:01,097
Yes. Everything is fine.

912
01:04:01,537 --> 01:04:02,561
We will fell the tree today.

913
01:04:04,407 --> 01:04:05,567
What happened?

914
01:04:05,675 --> 01:04:06,699
Nothing, sir.

915
01:04:06,809 --> 01:04:07,833
l am doing it.

916
01:04:15,151 --> 01:04:16,243
Why are you coming down?

917
01:04:16,419 --> 01:04:18,649
Okay, sir. - lf you come down,
then who will do the work?

918
01:04:18,888 --> 01:04:20,651
Where are you going?

919
01:04:21,157 --> 01:04:23,182
Let me go, sir, it is very urgent.

920
01:04:23,292 --> 01:04:24,316
Cutting the tree is more important.

921
01:04:24,427 --> 01:04:25,655
This is even more important.

922
01:04:26,495 --> 01:04:27,519
Listen.

923
01:04:28,164 --> 01:04:29,188
Where are you going?

924
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:35,793
This is his everyday problem.

925
01:04:36,839 --> 01:04:38,204
You don't have any problem,
isn't it?

926
01:04:38,374 --> 01:04:39,398
Sir.

927
01:04:40,443 --> 01:04:42,138
Okay.
-Absolutely okay.

928
01:04:42,245 --> 01:04:44,145
Early in the morning, l..

929
01:04:47,383 --> 01:04:49,544
Sir, in the morning, l..

930
01:04:50,653 --> 01:04:52,621
l had done my..

931
01:04:53,322 --> 01:04:54,346
The pressure has increased.

932
01:04:54,724 --> 01:04:55,748
l will be back in two minutes.
-The tree.

933
01:04:55,858 --> 01:04:58,156
The pressure has increased.

934
01:04:59,729 --> 01:05:02,357
Their pressure increases,
and l get tensed.

935
01:05:05,801 --> 01:05:08,770
Karan, you are
hiding somethingfrom me.

936
01:05:09,472 --> 01:05:10,496
What's going on?

937
01:05:12,475 --> 01:05:14,568
'Ten dropsare
enough for one person.'

938
01:05:15,544 --> 01:05:17,171
'lt is a very strong purgative.'

939
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:18,577
'Use it carefully.'

940
01:05:18,814 --> 01:05:19,838
'Here.'

941
01:05:20,216 --> 01:05:21,706
They have wasted my
time since morning.

942
01:05:21,817 --> 01:05:23,307
Useless. Useless.

943
01:05:32,228 --> 01:05:35,527
l wonder what l eat
and drink in the morning.

944
01:05:40,369 --> 01:05:42,860
How much of the
medicine did you use?

945
01:05:43,372 --> 01:05:45,340
'Ravan saidten dropsare enough.'

946
01:05:46,309 --> 01:05:48,402
'There are two people, so
this will be sufficient.'

947
01:05:48,844 --> 01:05:52,211
'He must have saidten drops
consideringthe children.'

948
01:05:52,782 --> 01:05:55,615
'Do one thing. Add
the entire bottle.'

949
01:05:55,718 --> 01:05:56,878
'Entire bottle.'
- 'Yes.'

950
01:05:58,854 --> 01:06:00,287
Come out.

951
01:06:00,723 --> 01:06:02,623
Come out, my friend.

952
01:06:02,925 --> 01:06:04,950
Come out, l beg of you..

953
01:06:05,528 --> 01:06:06,552
l need to go very urgently.

954
01:06:06,662 --> 01:06:07,754
Come out.

955
01:06:07,863 --> 01:06:08,887
You are still here.
- Yes.

956
01:06:08,998 --> 01:06:11,432
Go and cut the tree.
- Sir, don't be so cruel to me.

957
01:06:11,867 --> 01:06:13,892
Let me go inside once.

958
01:06:14,003 --> 01:06:15,561
l am the boss, l
will go inside first.

959
01:06:15,671 --> 01:06:18,697
Come out. Come out.

960
01:06:22,878 --> 01:06:24,368
Dattu, come out.

961
01:06:25,881 --> 01:06:26,905
Just a minute.

962
01:06:30,686 --> 01:06:31,710
She is gone.

963
01:06:32,288 --> 01:06:33,312
What are you doing here?

964
01:06:33,422 --> 01:06:34,912
Mr. Gupta, come along. We
all are goingto the temple.

965
01:06:35,291 --> 01:06:37,452
No, at this time, l
can go only to one place.

966
01:06:37,560 --> 01:06:38,857
And that's not the temple.

967
01:06:40,363 --> 01:06:41,455
What is this noise?

968
01:06:41,564 --> 01:06:42,929
That's.. that's what l am..
-This odour..

969
01:06:43,032 --> 01:06:44,659
There are strange
noises coming here.

970
01:06:44,767 --> 01:06:46,257
That's why, l am saying..
- Mr. Gupta. Mr. Gupta.

971
01:06:46,369 --> 01:06:47,734
Mr. Gupta, listen to me.

972
01:06:47,903 --> 01:06:49,666
Last night, Lord
Ganesh came in my dreams..

973
01:06:49,772 --> 01:06:51,467
..and saidthat l
will get married soon.

974
01:06:51,974 --> 01:06:53,942
Love will work it's miracle on me.

975
01:06:54,310 --> 01:06:56,278
Come to the temple with me,
you will surely benefit.

976
01:06:56,379 --> 01:06:59,678
No. if you don't leave, l
definitely won't benefit.

977
01:06:59,849 --> 01:07:01,282
Go from here, l beg of you.

978
01:07:01,384 --> 01:07:04,285
Go.
- Mr. Gupta. Mr. Gupta. - Go.

979
01:07:04,387 --> 01:07:05,411
Go.

980
01:07:06,322 --> 01:07:07,619
Come out.

981
01:07:09,325 --> 01:07:10,883
He still hasn't come out.
- He is still sitting inside.

982
01:07:10,993 --> 01:07:14,429
Dattu, come out otherwise, l
will dismiss you from the job.

983
01:07:14,864 --> 01:07:16,024
l am coming, sir.

984
01:07:17,066 --> 01:07:21,025
l am a family man. Don't
dismiss me from the job.

985
01:07:25,341 --> 01:07:26,433
l will holdthis.

986
01:07:26,542 --> 01:07:28,305
As soon as he comes out,
the bad air will come out..

987
01:07:28,411 --> 01:07:29,435
..then you go inside.

988
01:07:29,545 --> 01:07:31,445
He is coming. He is coming.

989
01:07:31,547 --> 01:07:32,571
The badair isalso
coming out. Just a minute.

990
01:07:33,015 --> 01:07:34,312
Go. Go away, bad air. Go away,
badair. Go away, badair.

991
01:07:34,417 --> 01:07:36,908
Go inside. Go inside. Go inside.

992
01:07:37,019 --> 01:07:39,852
Sattu. Sattu, l won't
spare you. l won't spare you.

993
01:07:39,955 --> 01:07:42,515
Poor Gupta. He kept
screamingfor half an hour.

994
01:07:42,625 --> 01:07:44,320
And by the time the
bathroom was vacated..

995
01:07:45,494 --> 01:07:46,927
Until then, it was very late.

996
01:07:48,564 --> 01:07:50,327
And Laddu put in everything he had..

997
01:07:50,433 --> 01:07:51,457
..by runningaround in circles.

998
01:07:52,701 --> 01:07:53,998
Okay, l am leaving now.

999
01:07:54,103 --> 01:07:56,333
Priya needs help for her project.

1000
01:07:56,439 --> 01:07:58,339
For that, l needto
go to the library.

1001
01:07:58,441 --> 01:08:00,409
lf Priya has said it,
then you will have to go.

1002
01:08:00,509 --> 01:08:01,999
Quiet.
- Hey.

1003
01:08:04,380 --> 01:08:05,404
Here.

1004
01:08:08,050 --> 01:08:10,075
Karan. You are not helping me.

1005
01:08:11,720 --> 01:08:12,812
Tell me. Tell me.

1006
01:08:13,389 --> 01:08:15,016
You know what my
project is, isn't it?

1007
01:08:15,724 --> 01:08:17,351
l don't even know my project.

1008
01:08:18,727 --> 01:08:21,025
Listen, l am
interested in Japanese houses.

1009
01:08:21,130 --> 01:08:23,098
Because they are
earthquake resistant.

1010
01:08:23,666 --> 01:08:24,690
Who told you?

1011
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:29,362
ln 1998, there wasa
huge earthquake in Japan.

1012
01:08:29,538 --> 01:08:32,371
But not a single
house fell, you know.

1013
01:08:33,008 --> 01:08:36,967
1998. No, l was in
lndia at that time.

1014
01:08:40,015 --> 01:08:41,778
Karan, be serious.

1015
01:08:42,418 --> 01:08:45,444
l want to research the raw
materials of this house.

1016
01:08:46,622 --> 01:08:50,718
Shall we go to the
newspaper section? - Come on.

1017
01:09:02,438 --> 01:09:05,134
National award winning artist,
Mr. Sudhir Apte is missing..

1018
01:09:05,441 --> 01:09:07,534
..from his residence
at Pratap Nagar, Nagpur.

1019
01:09:07,977 --> 01:09:09,467
lf anyone knows his whereabouts..

1020
01:09:09,578 --> 01:09:11,478
..please contact the
nearby police station.

1021
01:09:12,181 --> 01:09:14,411
Father, please
forgive usand return home.

1022
01:09:14,517 --> 01:09:15,541
Yours, Vinod.

1023
01:09:31,534 --> 01:09:32,558
Come. Come.

1024
01:09:35,204 --> 01:09:38,037
l have heard that Nagpur
is famous for oranges.

1025
01:09:39,008 --> 01:09:40,566
l have heard so too.

1026
01:09:40,676 --> 01:09:41,973
You get good oranges there.

1027
01:09:42,611 --> 01:09:43,771
How is Nagpur?

1028
01:09:44,547 --> 01:09:47,914
l have heard it is quite a
warm place. - l don't know.

1029
01:09:48,617 --> 01:09:49,845
Have you finished Priya's job?

1030
01:09:50,686 --> 01:09:52,916
How far is Nagpur from Mumbai?

1031
01:09:54,156 --> 01:09:56,716
Why are you asking so
many questionsabout Nagpur?

1032
01:09:57,026 --> 01:09:58,516
Do you want to go
there to buy oranges?

1033
01:09:59,562 --> 01:10:01,530
Why did you leave
Nagpur and come here?

1034
01:10:11,507 --> 01:10:12,531
Look.

1035
01:10:14,843 --> 01:10:16,538
Your son is so worried.

1036
01:10:21,183 --> 01:10:22,207
At least read it once.

1037
01:10:23,719 --> 01:10:24,743
They are apologising.

1038
01:10:26,188 --> 01:10:28,486
Go back to your family.

1039
01:10:28,591 --> 01:10:30,889
Why do you stay all
alone on the road?

1040
01:10:35,664 --> 01:10:39,566
l live on the road, l do
it with my own free will.

1041
01:10:43,072 --> 01:10:44,699
You are still a child now,
you won't understand.

1042
01:10:46,675 --> 01:10:48,506
Never talk about thisagain.

1043
01:11:02,558 --> 01:11:03,923
Gupta.
- Yes, sir.

1044
01:11:04,026 --> 01:11:06,187
Gupta. You are not a fool.
- No sir.

1045
01:11:06,295 --> 01:11:09,196
You are an absolute idiot.

1046
01:11:09,298 --> 01:11:10,925
Acomplete idiot.
- Right, sir.

1047
01:11:11,033 --> 01:11:13,194
Some children fooled you.

1048
01:11:13,302 --> 01:11:14,530
Another day got wasted.

1049
01:11:14,637 --> 01:11:16,127
And that tree is
still standingthere.

1050
01:11:16,238 --> 01:11:18,729
Sir, l never thought those
children were so mischievous.

1051
01:11:18,841 --> 01:11:20,536
Sir, they troubled me a lot. Alot.

1052
01:11:20,909 --> 01:11:22,740
But sir, l am trying.

1053
01:11:23,579 --> 01:11:25,740
We will soon get the
permission to cut the tree.

1054
01:11:25,848 --> 01:11:26,872
Permission.
- Yes, sir.

1055
01:11:26,982 --> 01:11:28,540
lf builders waitedfor permission..

1056
01:11:28,651 --> 01:11:30,619
..none of the trees of
Mumbai would have been felled.

1057
01:11:30,719 --> 01:11:32,619
Right, sir.
- Come here.

1058
01:11:33,589 --> 01:11:36,149
Tonight, everyone will
be asleep in the society.

1059
01:11:36,258 --> 01:11:37,555
The children will be asleep too.

1060
01:11:37,726 --> 01:11:39,887
Cut that tree in the night.

1061
01:11:40,129 --> 01:11:41,221
No one will even doubt us.

1062
01:11:41,330 --> 01:11:42,888
We love nature.

1063
01:11:43,332 --> 01:11:45,960
Sir, that'sa wonderful idea.

1064
01:11:46,802 --> 01:11:49,635
Be assured, that tree
will be felledtonight.

1065
01:11:52,608 --> 01:11:53,632
Come on, quickly.

1066
01:11:54,143 --> 01:11:56,577
We have to fell this tree tonight.
- Yes.

1067
01:12:04,987 --> 01:12:06,579
What is the police doing
here so late in the night?

1068
01:12:09,024 --> 01:12:11,322
Sir. Look, some
people are standingthere.

1069
01:12:11,827 --> 01:12:14,591
l will kill you today.

1070
01:12:14,697 --> 01:12:15,721
What's going on here?

1071
01:12:16,165 --> 01:12:18,599
You don't know who l am.

1072
01:12:19,234 --> 01:12:22,601
Encounter specialist, Daya Naik.

1073
01:12:23,639 --> 01:12:26,073
The entire police
department is under my control.

1074
01:12:27,376 --> 01:12:30,607
l have done 56 encounters until now.

1075
01:12:31,380 --> 01:12:32,608
Sir.
- Yes.

1076
01:12:32,715 --> 01:12:33,739
This isa police encounter.

1077
01:12:33,849 --> 01:12:35,612
l won't spare you.

1078
01:12:35,718 --> 01:12:37,618
Dangerous inspector Daya Naik
is standing there.

1079
01:12:37,786 --> 01:12:40,949
Come on, sir. Let us flee from
here. - No. - What do you think?

1080
01:12:41,256 --> 01:12:42,280
Let us hide here.

1081
01:12:42,391 --> 01:12:45,622
We have to cut the
tree after he leaves.

1082
01:12:48,263 --> 01:12:49,287
Oh, God. Run.

1083
01:12:49,665 --> 01:12:50,689
Come on.

1084
01:12:50,799 --> 01:12:53,097
Hey. Stop, or else, l will shoot.

1085
01:12:55,671 --> 01:12:57,696
What are you doing
so late in the night..

1086
01:12:57,806 --> 01:12:58,898
..with an axe in hand?

1087
01:12:59,708 --> 01:13:03,371
No, nothing. We were
just going to fell a tree.

1088
01:13:04,146 --> 01:13:07,638
Oh. So, you want to kill the tree.

1089
01:13:08,083 --> 01:13:09,380
What a joke, sir.

1090
01:13:09,885 --> 01:13:12,718
Trees have life too.
- Really.

1091
01:13:13,389 --> 01:13:15,186
Then we won't cut the tree.
Good luck, sir.

1092
01:13:15,424 --> 01:13:16,652
Hey. Stop.

1093
01:13:17,693 --> 01:13:19,320
You have seen everything.

1094
01:13:20,129 --> 01:13:22,723
Now, l will have to kill you all.

1095
01:13:23,766 --> 01:13:25,996
Run. Run. We will get shot.

1096
01:13:26,101 --> 01:13:27,125
What are you doing?

1097
01:13:30,439 --> 01:13:31,736
Come on. Come on.

1098
01:13:42,251 --> 01:13:43,684
No, no, stop.

1099
01:13:43,786 --> 01:13:45,686
No, no, please.

1100
01:13:45,788 --> 01:13:47,221
Laddu. Please, no.

1101
01:13:48,390 --> 01:13:49,755
And now, from the railway end.

1102
01:13:50,225 --> 01:13:51,419
Next over before lunch.

1103
01:13:52,394 --> 01:13:54,021
lt has been a very
good day for the team.

1104
01:13:54,396 --> 01:13:55,420
And that's bold of him.

1105
01:14:03,939 --> 01:14:06,703
'75 runs have been scored.'

1106
01:14:07,476 --> 01:14:10,775
'Andthe next batsman is lqbal
Khan, the captain of the team.'

1107
01:14:11,480 --> 01:14:13,448
'He has scored three
consecutive centuries.'

1108
01:14:15,751 --> 01:14:17,378
'His team expectsa lot from him.'

1109
01:14:19,021 --> 01:14:20,716
lf you would have
imitatedthe sound..

1110
01:14:20,823 --> 01:14:22,848
..of another bullet, then Gupta
would have suffered a heart-attack.

1111
01:14:25,227 --> 01:14:28,458
Will you teach me to do mimicry?

1112
01:14:29,097 --> 01:14:30,121
Yes, why not?

1113
01:14:31,433 --> 01:14:34,732
ln return, if l get to see a cricket
match and have good cake to eat..

1114
01:14:34,837 --> 01:14:35,861
..then l will teach you everything.

1115
01:14:35,971 --> 01:14:38,064
The next ball is
being bowled.. and out.

1116
01:14:43,779 --> 01:14:47,875
This party is not for your aid.
-Then..

1117
01:14:48,851 --> 01:14:51,752
lt's because our friend Rahul
has become the 'man of the match'.

1118
01:14:51,854 --> 01:14:54,823
He has taken six wicketsand
scored 70 runsagainst Delhi.

1119
01:14:55,457 --> 01:14:56,481
Very nice.

1120
01:14:57,259 --> 01:14:58,283
Who is Rahul?

1121
01:15:02,531 --> 01:15:05,500
Rahul, your grandson.

1122
01:15:07,135 --> 01:15:08,159
Rahul Apte.

1123
01:15:10,138 --> 01:15:11,503
He is the captain
of the Nagpur team.

1124
01:15:12,808 --> 01:15:14,241
He is going for the
England tour the next week.

1125
01:15:15,277 --> 01:15:16,835
And so you will
have to learn English.

1126
01:15:19,281 --> 01:15:21,181
l will help you save your tree.

1127
01:15:23,118 --> 01:15:25,450
But you don't have to
help me save my family.

1128
01:15:30,425 --> 01:15:31,790
Ravan. Ravan, stop.

1129
01:15:32,828 --> 01:15:34,261
Clean-bowled.
- Listen to me.

1130
01:15:34,363 --> 01:15:36,524
Rahul took a hat-trick.

1131
01:15:36,832 --> 01:15:40,996
Rahul. Rahul.

1132
01:15:41,103 --> 01:15:44,869
That bowler is Rahul.
- Rahul. Rahul.

1133
01:16:13,869 --> 01:16:15,962
Hey, well played.
- Thanks.

1134
01:16:16,338 --> 01:16:17,965
Come on, we are getting late.
- Yes, l am coming.

1135
01:16:26,014 --> 01:16:27,038
Yes.

1136
01:16:29,351 --> 01:16:30,375
Do you want anything?

1137
01:16:31,353 --> 01:16:33,913
Come on, Rahul.
- Wait. l am coming.

1138
01:16:35,891 --> 01:16:36,915
Rahul, we are getting late.

1139
01:16:37,025 --> 01:16:38,515
Coming. Wait a minute.

1140
01:16:38,627 --> 01:16:42,927
'Father, my son won't waste
his time in dust and sand.'

1141
01:16:43,231 --> 01:16:45,461
'Son, his handsare miraculous.
- Father.'

1142
01:16:45,634 --> 01:16:50,333
'Son, this mud.. this
art is our heritage.'

1143
01:16:50,906 --> 01:16:51,930
'lf you want to
stay in this house..'

1144
01:16:52,040 --> 01:16:53,064
'..you will have to listen to me.'

1145
01:16:53,308 --> 01:16:54,400
'You cannot do as you please.'

1146
01:16:55,143 --> 01:16:56,405
'Rahul, let's go from here.'

1147
01:16:56,511 --> 01:16:57,944
'No, l want to learn.'

1148
01:16:58,180 --> 01:17:00,478
'Papa, l want to learn.'

1149
01:17:03,118 --> 01:17:05,882
Mr. Astana, this is one
of my prime properties.

1150
01:17:06,121 --> 01:17:07,418
What a beautiful location.

1151
01:17:08,256 --> 01:17:09,951
And what a beautiful building.

1152
01:17:10,058 --> 01:17:11,218
My God, fantastic.

1153
01:17:11,326 --> 01:17:13,954
l am very sure that you
will book an entire floor.

1154
01:17:14,930 --> 01:17:15,954
Fine, come tomorrow.

1155
01:17:16,064 --> 01:17:18,032
Of course, we will
show you the model flat.

1156
01:17:18,133 --> 01:17:19,157
Okay, bye.

1157
01:17:20,535 --> 01:17:22,059
So, chief of liars.

1158
01:17:22,671 --> 01:17:23,968
You, Gupta.

1159
01:17:24,940 --> 01:17:25,964
What is this new story?

1160
01:17:26,074 --> 01:17:27,439
lnspector, an encounter.

1161
01:17:27,542 --> 01:17:28,907
No, sir. Believe me.

1162
01:17:29,077 --> 01:17:31,045
lnspector Daya Naik
was present there.

1163
01:17:31,680 --> 01:17:33,204
Somehow, we saved ourselves.

1164
01:17:33,315 --> 01:17:36,045
You saved yourselves.

1165
01:17:36,585 --> 01:17:37,984
This is not your cup of tea.

1166
01:17:38,687 --> 01:17:40,985
l will fell this tree. Me.

1167
01:17:42,691 --> 01:17:46,149
l will see how long this
tree keeps standing. - Sir.

1168
01:17:46,261 --> 01:17:47,660
This tree is done for.

1169
01:17:48,597 --> 01:17:49,621
And listen..
- Yes, sir.

1170
01:17:49,965 --> 01:17:51,933
Mr. Astana is
coming to see the flat.

1171
01:17:52,034 --> 01:17:53,399
Clean the model floor properly.

1172
01:18:00,709 --> 01:18:01,937
Right where that man is standing..

1173
01:18:02,044 --> 01:18:03,068
..there isa board.

1174
01:18:05,247 --> 01:18:06,271
Stop here.

1175
01:18:07,716 --> 01:18:08,944
Mister. Hey, mister.

1176
01:18:09,618 --> 01:18:11,210
Have you seen the
Bakshi builder's site?

1177
01:18:11,987 --> 01:18:13,011
Go straight.

1178
01:18:13,321 --> 01:18:15,949
But on the board, it shows both.
Left as well as right.

1179
01:18:16,992 --> 01:18:18,016
Go.

1180
01:18:20,996 --> 01:18:22,020
Give me Rs.10.

1181
01:18:23,165 --> 01:18:24,962
Here, mister. Here,
keep it for yourself.

1182
01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:26,697
l don't want anythingfrom you.

1183
01:18:29,571 --> 01:18:33,029
l am giving you a gift.

1184
01:18:34,209 --> 01:18:39,044
Like this plant, may
your family always prosper.

1185
01:18:39,281 --> 01:18:40,305
lt always stays together.

1186
01:18:40,415 --> 01:18:42,178
Newspaper. Newspaper. Sir, take one.

1187
01:18:42,284 --> 01:18:43,308
l don't want it, dear.

1188
01:18:43,485 --> 01:18:45,043
Sir, l am not selling it.

1189
01:18:45,153 --> 01:18:47,986
lt'sa gift. Sir, it is
very important to read it.

1190
01:18:48,356 --> 01:18:52,053
Sir, it's written that every year,
20,000 trees are felled in Mumbai.

1191
01:18:53,628 --> 01:18:54,652
Sir, this plant.

1192
01:18:56,298 --> 01:18:59,734
Sir, one by one, we will
plant 20,000 trees every year.

1193
01:19:01,236 --> 01:19:02,260
Sir, please take it.

1194
01:19:02,370 --> 01:19:03,394
Every sapling is very important.

1195
01:19:05,707 --> 01:19:06,731
Thank you.

1196
01:19:24,259 --> 01:19:26,090
ls this the construction site
of the Bakshi builders? - Yes.

1197
01:19:26,595 --> 01:19:27,755
Yes. - Wait here.

1198
01:19:30,665 --> 01:19:31,689
Thank you.

1199
01:19:32,801 --> 01:19:34,029
Where do you want to go, sir?

1200
01:19:34,336 --> 01:19:35,428
To Mr. Bakshi's office.

1201
01:19:36,138 --> 01:19:38,766
Have you come here to buy a flat?
- Yes.

1202
01:19:39,374 --> 01:19:41,365
Then take this, a
sapling from my behalf.

1203
01:19:41,810 --> 01:19:43,778
l already have two saplings.
Here's another one.

1204
01:19:44,079 --> 01:19:45,774
Two is better than one.
Three is better than two.

1205
01:19:46,081 --> 01:19:48,641
By the way, how many
cars do you have? - Three.

1206
01:19:49,184 --> 01:19:53,314
Oh, God, do you know how
much pollution each car spreads?

1207
01:19:54,089 --> 01:19:57,058
That's fine, but it's not a luxury.
lt's my need, son.

1208
01:19:57,392 --> 01:20:00,122
Fine, you can buy as
many carsas you want.

1209
01:20:00,295 --> 01:20:02,729
But plant a sapling
with each car you buy.

1210
01:20:03,098 --> 01:20:05,123
Because the tree will
take up all the carbon..

1211
01:20:05,233 --> 01:20:08,464
..that your car will emit,
and release oxygen.

1212
01:20:08,703 --> 01:20:09,727
And if the oxygen level increases..

1213
01:20:09,838 --> 01:20:11,066
..pollution will decrease.

1214
01:20:11,173 --> 01:20:12,663
The threat of global
warning will reduce too.

1215
01:20:12,841 --> 01:20:14,069
Please take it, sir.

1216
01:20:15,110 --> 01:20:16,134
Yes, you are right.

1217
01:20:16,378 --> 01:20:18,073
Seems like it's
world sapling day today.

1218
01:20:18,180 --> 01:20:19,204
Thank you.

1219
01:20:19,314 --> 01:20:21,805
Oh, yes, Bakshi sir's
office is behindthis building.

1220
01:20:22,117 --> 01:20:23,744
My shift is over. l am going, sir.

1221
01:20:27,455 --> 01:20:29,753
Welcome, welcome Mr. Astana.

1222
01:20:29,858 --> 01:20:31,291
l was waitingfor you.

1223
01:20:31,526 --> 01:20:33,153
l hope you didn't have any
problem findingthe site?

1224
01:20:33,595 --> 01:20:35,290
Yes, Mr. Bakshi, l have
wandered a lot since morning.

1225
01:20:35,764 --> 01:20:37,493
Come on. Let's take a
look at your model flat.

1226
01:20:37,666 --> 01:20:39,099
Right away. - Gupta.
- Coming, sir.

1227
01:20:39,201 --> 01:20:40,759
Gupta, get the key to
the model flat. Come on.

1228
01:20:40,869 --> 01:20:42,166
Quickly. Quickly. Come on.

1229
01:20:42,270 --> 01:20:43,294
Sir, there isa problem.

1230
01:20:43,872 --> 01:20:45,100
We can't findthe key, sir.

1231
01:20:45,473 --> 01:20:46,497
What are you saying, silly?

1232
01:20:46,608 --> 01:20:47,768
You always have the key.

1233
01:20:47,876 --> 01:20:49,104
Bring it quickly. Bring it quickly.

1234
01:20:49,211 --> 01:20:51,111
He isa very valuable customer.
Come, come.

1235
01:20:51,213 --> 01:20:52,237
l willjust get it.

1236
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:53,504
l had kept it here.

1237
01:20:53,615 --> 01:20:54,639
Where did it go?

1238
01:20:55,750 --> 01:20:56,774
Sir.
- Quiet.

1239
01:20:57,886 --> 01:21:00,377
Sir, are you searching for this key?

1240
01:21:01,756 --> 01:21:02,780
How did it get there?

1241
01:21:12,167 --> 01:21:13,191
Come, sir. Come.

1242
01:21:13,401 --> 01:21:15,392
This is our model.. a spacious flat.

1243
01:21:15,570 --> 01:21:17,197
Height, 9ft 3.5 inches.

1244
01:21:17,639 --> 01:21:19,869
l suggest that you buy all
the flats on the top floor.

1245
01:21:20,342 --> 01:21:23,334
lt has got an astonishing view,
and wonderful breeze.

1246
01:21:23,445 --> 01:21:24,878
Very airy.
- Yes. Yes.

1247
01:21:25,780 --> 01:21:27,873
Speak. l am with a customer.

1248
01:21:29,451 --> 01:21:30,475
Yes, if it'sa good property..

1249
01:21:30,585 --> 01:21:31,813
..we are ready to buy it anywhere.

1250
01:21:32,187 --> 01:21:34,348
Whether it isa park, or a
public toilet, everything will do.

1251
01:21:34,589 --> 01:21:37,217
Bakshi sir, come here.
- One minute.

1252
01:21:37,926 --> 01:21:40,224
Seems like you like
these saplingsa lot.

1253
01:21:40,395 --> 01:21:42,625
Look, you have created
an entire rainforest here.

1254
01:21:44,666 --> 01:21:47,157
You know l love nature.

1255
01:21:47,335 --> 01:21:48,359
Natural builder, sir.

1256
01:21:48,470 --> 01:21:49,698
l love nature.

1257
01:21:50,205 --> 01:21:52,230
l am goingto make a
big garden downstairs.

1258
01:21:52,340 --> 01:21:56,174
Andthen all these saplings
will be transportedthere.

1259
01:21:56,278 --> 01:21:57,302
lt will be shifted there.

1260
01:21:57,412 --> 01:21:58,436
We will make a beautiful garden.

1261
01:21:58,747 --> 01:21:59,839
l love nature.

1262
01:22:00,215 --> 01:22:01,307
You should. Good.

1263
01:22:02,751 --> 01:22:03,775
Love nature.

1264
01:22:04,386 --> 01:22:05,853
Gupta. Gupta.

1265
01:22:06,821 --> 01:22:08,846
You cleaned the room very nicely.

1266
01:22:08,957 --> 01:22:10,185
Sir, l had cleaned it.

1267
01:22:10,292 --> 01:22:11,384
l don't know where
these saplings came from.

1268
01:22:11,493 --> 01:22:12,517
Ten minutes. Within
ten minutes, find out..

1269
01:22:12,627 --> 01:22:15,391
..where this saplings come from,
otherwise l will..

1270
01:22:15,497 --> 01:22:16,521
Dismiss you from the job.
Dismiss you from the job.

1271
01:22:16,631 --> 01:22:18,565
l know. - This time l
will surely dismiss you.

1272
01:22:18,967 --> 01:22:21,333
This entire area will
become very developed.

1273
01:22:21,803 --> 01:22:23,862
Malls are being constructed,
so are multiplexes.

1274
01:22:24,773 --> 01:22:26,866
l have ten clients
for every flat of mine.

1275
01:22:27,242 --> 01:22:29,267
You are an old investor of ours.
That's why l am saying..

1276
01:22:29,377 --> 01:22:30,469
..you should quickly book a flat.

1277
01:22:30,578 --> 01:22:34,537
Uncle, did you like the flat?
- Yes, dear. l did.

1278
01:22:35,250 --> 01:22:36,615
That means your house will be made.

1279
01:22:37,585 --> 01:22:39,883
But our tree house will be broken.

1280
01:22:40,488 --> 01:22:43,616
Because they are felling
this tree for your flat.

1281
01:22:43,959 --> 01:22:47,690
Dear, it is very
important to cut this tree.

1282
01:22:48,496 --> 01:22:50,293
You won't understandthese things.

1283
01:22:50,665 --> 01:22:52,428
You don't understand
the tree either, sir.

1284
01:22:55,270 --> 01:22:57,295
You don't even know how
long it takesa sapling..

1285
01:22:57,405 --> 01:22:58,429
..to become a bigtree.

1286
01:23:00,308 --> 01:23:03,300
You will fell this tree in an hour.

1287
01:23:03,411 --> 01:23:05,311
Give me this sapling.
l will plant it. - No, no.

1288
01:23:06,581 --> 01:23:08,981
lt will die if you plant it.

1289
01:23:10,452 --> 01:23:13,319
But Uncle, you can save our tree.

1290
01:23:14,022 --> 01:23:17,458
Look, if you stop him,
then he might listen to you.

1291
01:23:17,993 --> 01:23:19,255
Our tree doesn't
obstruct any hoarding..

1292
01:23:19,361 --> 01:23:22,330
..nor is it in the
middle of the road.

1293
01:23:23,298 --> 01:23:26,790
Please, sir. Save our tree.

1294
01:23:28,503 --> 01:23:30,334
The children are
getting very emotional.

1295
01:23:40,315 --> 01:23:41,339
Take this.

1296
01:23:41,983 --> 01:23:43,280
They are very beautiful saplings.

1297
01:23:43,385 --> 01:23:44,409
The children gave them to me.

1298
01:23:44,652 --> 01:23:45,744
Surely plant them in the garden.

1299
01:23:46,454 --> 01:23:50,550
l love nature. That's the
only thing l love. Nature.

1300
01:23:51,059 --> 01:23:52,686
That's true. l will see you.
- Okay.

1301
01:23:52,794 --> 01:23:53,818
Come on.

1302
01:24:06,941 --> 01:24:10,035
So, you are the children
Gupta was praising so much.

1303
01:24:10,345 --> 01:24:11,369
Today, l got to meet you.

1304
01:24:12,347 --> 01:24:15,441
l love nature. l love nature.

1305
01:24:15,683 --> 01:24:18,777
l use everything
natural in my building.

1306
01:24:19,087 --> 01:24:21,453
You love this tree a lot, don't you?

1307
01:24:21,823 --> 01:24:22,847
That's good.

1308
01:24:22,957 --> 01:24:25,926
That's why you told
everythingto my biggest client.

1309
01:24:27,629 --> 01:24:29,392
l love nature.

1310
01:24:30,432 --> 01:24:33,458
Tomorrow, l will uproot this tree.

1311
01:24:35,370 --> 01:24:38,396
l have the government's permission.
Permission.

1312
01:24:38,706 --> 01:24:40,333
Whatever happened
until now is the past.

1313
01:24:40,442 --> 01:24:42,842
Now, l will see how
you save this tree.

1314
01:24:42,944 --> 01:24:44,411
Sir.. - Leave me.

1315
01:24:44,512 --> 01:24:47,879
Sir, this useless boy isa part
of their charade too. - No. No.

1316
01:24:47,982 --> 01:24:51,008
Yes, and he had stolen the
key to the model flat. - No.

1317
01:24:51,119 --> 01:24:53,485
And he is the informer of
these children. - No. No.

1318
01:24:53,855 --> 01:24:56,688
You work for me and help them.

1319
01:24:57,392 --> 01:24:59,019
l will have to take care
of you and your mother.

1320
01:24:59,394 --> 01:25:00,691
Gupta.
- l will take him away.

1321
01:25:00,929 --> 01:25:02,362
Leave him. - Move.

1322
01:25:02,664 --> 01:25:03,688
He didn't do anything.

1323
01:25:04,399 --> 01:25:05,423
We asked him to do it.

1324
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,434
We will soon know who has done what.

1325
01:25:09,137 --> 01:25:11,367
l will talk to your
father today andtell him..

1326
01:25:11,473 --> 01:25:14,636
..how you are obstructing my work.

1327
01:25:15,743 --> 01:25:19,907
You don't know what l can do. Okay.

1328
01:25:21,583 --> 01:25:24,518
Mother, they are all
goodfriends of mine.

1329
01:25:25,086 --> 01:25:26,644
We have scared
away Gupta many times.

1330
01:25:27,755 --> 01:25:28,847
They are from a rich family.

1331
01:25:30,692 --> 01:25:31,716
Everything they do is right.

1332
01:25:33,161 --> 01:25:35,925
And we only have to
endure the beatings.

1333
01:25:36,965 --> 01:25:37,989
We are the ones who are abused.

1334
01:25:41,169 --> 01:25:43,069
You have been beaten
for your friendship.

1335
01:25:44,439 --> 01:25:45,463
Didanyone come to save you?

1336
01:25:46,975 --> 01:25:49,535
Look, Karan, this behaviour
of yours won't save the tree.

1337
01:25:50,979 --> 01:25:52,139
Why don't you save the tree?

1338
01:25:53,948 --> 01:25:55,415
Look, Bakshi sir has given
a donation to the society..

1339
01:25:55,517 --> 01:25:58,748
..andthe society has given
him a no-objection certificate.

1340
01:25:59,821 --> 01:26:01,413
Andthat donation
money will be used for..

1341
01:26:01,523 --> 01:26:03,423
..the maintenance
cost of the society.

1342
01:26:03,725 --> 01:26:04,953
That's what all the members want.

1343
01:26:06,661 --> 01:26:09,027
And Karan, we are
not social workers.

1344
01:26:11,032 --> 01:26:12,431
An agitation from
middle-class people..

1345
01:26:12,534 --> 01:26:13,558
..won't make any difference.

1346
01:26:14,602 --> 01:26:16,968
20,000 plus one is 20,001 .

1347
01:26:17,472 --> 01:26:18,769
What difference does one tree make?

1348
01:26:19,474 --> 01:26:23,968
lt is not just a tree house.
lt is our dwelling place.

1349
01:26:26,481 --> 01:26:27,505
Don't you understand?

1350
01:26:29,083 --> 01:26:30,516
Don't you understand?

1351
01:26:31,052 --> 01:26:32,076
Talking nonsense.

1352
01:26:34,756 --> 01:26:37,782
You first have to
satisfy your hunger.

1353
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:40,518
Where will l take you both?

1354
01:26:41,829 --> 01:26:43,456
lf Gupta throws us out of our jobs..

1355
01:26:43,565 --> 01:26:45,590
..because of those rich children..

1356
01:26:45,700 --> 01:26:48,601
..then we will have to beg on
the streets with that beggar.

1357
01:26:48,770 --> 01:26:49,862
ls that what you want?

1358
01:26:51,239 --> 01:26:52,934
What will l do then?

1359
01:26:53,107 --> 01:26:54,131
What do l do?

1360
01:26:55,109 --> 01:26:57,134
You don't listen or understand.

1361
01:26:59,514 --> 01:27:00,538
Mother.

1362
01:27:02,183 --> 01:27:03,673
What can l do?

1363
01:27:04,519 --> 01:27:05,543
Don't cry, Mother.

1364
01:27:06,588 --> 01:27:07,612
Don't cry.

1365
01:27:08,122 --> 01:27:09,487
l will never go again, Mother.

1366
01:27:10,191 --> 01:27:11,556
l will never go there again.

1367
01:27:11,859 --> 01:27:13,224
l will never go there.

1368
01:27:26,274 --> 01:27:28,242
Sir. Sir.
- What is it?

1369
01:27:28,576 --> 01:27:29,668
Look.
- What is it?

1370
01:27:29,777 --> 01:27:31,176
Look. Look.

1371
01:27:31,279 --> 01:27:33,110
Yes, he is that beggar.
- No, sir, he is not the beggar.

1372
01:27:33,214 --> 01:27:34,511
He is the one that
instigates the children.

1373
01:27:34,682 --> 01:27:35,706
Look, when we go to cut the tree..

1374
01:27:35,817 --> 01:27:37,648
..he will interfere again.
- How?

1375
01:27:37,752 --> 01:27:38,980
Like this, he will interfere.

1376
01:27:39,153 --> 01:27:42,520
We are not chicks in
an eggthat can be..

1377
01:27:42,624 --> 01:27:46,253
..used in any way they'd like.

1378
01:27:47,228 --> 01:27:49,662
This time l will
break the eggfirst.

1379
01:27:50,765 --> 01:27:52,824
But sir, l don't think
that the egg will harm him.

1380
01:27:52,934 --> 01:27:58,600
You fool, Gupta, l mean, this
time l will take care of him first.

1381
01:28:09,651 --> 01:28:10,675
'That tree.'

1382
01:28:11,586 --> 01:28:13,952
'l love nature.'

1383
01:28:21,195 --> 01:28:22,219
Ravan.

1384
01:28:23,264 --> 01:28:24,288
Are you up there?

1385
01:28:27,268 --> 01:28:29,634
Ravan. Can you hear?

1386
01:28:36,611 --> 01:28:38,841
What are you doing
here so late in the night?

1387
01:28:40,214 --> 01:28:42,307
l had a terrible nightmare.

1388
01:28:43,951 --> 01:28:45,179
We won't be able to save our tree.

1389
01:28:46,621 --> 01:28:48,851
And now, Ram isn't with us either.

1390
01:28:52,093 --> 01:28:55,722
Bakshi has donated
money to your society.

1391
01:28:58,166 --> 01:28:59,724
And he has threatened Ram's mother.

1392
01:29:01,636 --> 01:29:03,194
Ram is helpless.

1393
01:29:04,839 --> 01:29:06,136
But don't be upset.

1394
01:29:06,841 --> 01:29:08,672
Till now, we have savedthe tree.

1395
01:29:09,844 --> 01:29:11,812
l am completely sure we will win.

1396
01:29:12,647 --> 01:29:13,671
Really?

1397
01:29:14,649 --> 01:29:17,675
Do you pray to God?
- Twice a day.

1398
01:29:18,386 --> 01:29:19,614
Then, that's it.

1399
01:29:19,921 --> 01:29:21,286
Do your duty honestly.

1400
01:29:22,123 --> 01:29:23,283
And leave the rest to him.

1401
01:29:25,326 --> 01:29:26,623
ln cricket, you must have heard..

1402
01:29:26,728 --> 01:29:31,688
..that the game is not over,
until the last ball is bowled.

1403
01:29:33,401 --> 01:29:34,629
You can speak English.

1404
01:29:35,069 --> 01:29:37,765
My grandson, Rahul,
is going to England.

1405
01:29:39,006 --> 01:29:40,701
l had to speak to him in English.

1406
01:29:41,209 --> 01:29:45,111
lsn't it? -That means you
will return to your family.

1407
01:29:49,684 --> 01:29:53,848
Yes. Yes.

1408
01:29:55,356 --> 01:29:56,914
Love changes everything.

1409
01:30:00,695 --> 01:30:02,390
My son and
daughter-in-law are apologising.

1410
01:30:05,032 --> 01:30:09,264
They will take a few
steps forward and so will l.

1411
01:30:12,240 --> 01:30:19,737
l won't spendthe rest of my
life alone for my stubbornness.

1412
01:30:20,448 --> 01:30:21,676
l won't.

1413
01:30:24,318 --> 01:30:26,684
And your friendship has taught me..

1414
01:30:26,788 --> 01:30:30,690
..that oldage is
just a second childhood.

1415
01:30:32,860 --> 01:30:37,763
l will live this
childhood with Rahul.

1416
01:30:38,266 --> 01:30:39,290
With Rahul.

1417
01:30:41,469 --> 01:30:45,235
l have gotten a
surprise gift for you.

1418
01:30:47,275 --> 01:30:48,902
Come. Come.

1419
01:30:55,416 --> 01:30:59,250
This is for your school project.
l have made it myself.

1420
01:31:08,496 --> 01:31:10,862
Do you live here?
- Yes. What happened?

1421
01:31:11,432 --> 01:31:13,798
Old man, you have been
spreading a lot of agitation.

1422
01:31:14,268 --> 01:31:15,792
We have got a lot of
complaintsagainst you.

1423
01:31:16,304 --> 01:31:17,999
Sir, that'sa lie. lt'sa lie, sir.

1424
01:31:18,105 --> 01:31:19,800
Oh, so, l am lying.

1425
01:31:21,976 --> 01:31:23,000
Break his hutment.

1426
01:31:23,344 --> 01:31:24,368
Come on, you idiot.

1427
01:31:24,512 --> 01:31:26,275
l will show you the
reality of the lock up. Come on.

1428
01:31:26,380 --> 01:31:28,280
No, sir. l haven't troubledanyone.

1429
01:31:28,382 --> 01:31:29,406
l haven't done anything.

1430
01:31:29,517 --> 01:31:31,280
Sir, he isa very nice man.
- l haven't done anything.

1431
01:31:31,519 --> 01:31:32,747
Why are you taking him away?

1432
01:31:32,854 --> 01:31:34,219
Hey, boy, don't argue.

1433
01:31:34,388 --> 01:31:35,412
Or should l take you
to the station too?

1434
01:31:35,523 --> 01:31:37,753
No, sir. Please
spare him. Spare him.

1435
01:31:37,859 --> 01:31:39,417
Hey, don't interfere. Go home.

1436
01:31:39,527 --> 01:31:40,755
Go home.

1437
01:31:40,862 --> 01:31:41,886
Come on, sit in the car.

1438
01:31:42,129 --> 01:31:43,153
The bag..

1439
01:31:50,538 --> 01:31:52,165
Ravan. Where is your bag?

1440
01:31:52,473 --> 01:31:53,497
Tell me quickly, Ravan.

1441
01:31:53,808 --> 01:31:55,435
Where is your bag?
Why don't you speak?

1442
01:31:57,545 --> 01:31:59,911
Sir, please stop the car.

1443
01:32:00,214 --> 01:32:01,238
He has left his bag behind.

1444
01:32:01,415 --> 01:32:02,439
Please.
- Hey, child.

1445
01:32:02,550 --> 01:32:04,450
Don't make excuses.
- He is an artist.

1446
01:32:04,552 --> 01:32:06,247
Come on. Don't make an excuse.
Let's get moving.

1447
01:32:07,555 --> 01:32:09,785
Ravan. Ravan, tell
me where your bag is.

1448
01:32:10,024 --> 01:32:11,787
Ravan. Ravan, tell me.

1449
01:32:17,565 --> 01:32:18,998
Goodbye, beggar.

1450
01:32:44,592 --> 01:32:47,254
''Feelings have become lifeless.''

1451
01:32:47,862 --> 01:32:50,353
''The heart has shattered.''

1452
01:32:50,865 --> 01:32:56,428
''Please tell us this
dream is not real.''

1453
01:32:56,971 --> 01:33:02,841
''All rays of hope
have been extinguished.''

1454
01:33:03,110 --> 01:33:07,137
''We are filled with sorrow.''

1455
01:33:09,216 --> 01:33:11,844
''Feelings have become lifeless.''

1456
01:33:12,420 --> 01:33:14,911
''The heart has shattered.''

1457
01:33:15,423 --> 01:33:21,851
''Please tell us this
dream is not real.''

1458
01:33:46,454 --> 01:33:53,883
''Helplessness is
testing our endurance.''

1459
01:33:58,666 --> 01:34:04,901
''Helplessness is
testing our endurance.''

1460
01:34:05,006 --> 01:34:10,273
''But l don't have
the wings to fly away.''

1461
01:34:10,611 --> 01:34:16,243
''lt's quiet and tranquil..
the moments have stopped.''

1462
01:34:16,951 --> 01:34:22,514
''Someone tell us
this dream is not real.''

1463
01:34:22,957 --> 01:34:28,589
''All rays of hope
have been extinguished.''

1464
01:34:28,963 --> 01:34:33,559
''We are filled with sorrow.''

1465
01:34:35,236 --> 01:34:37,966
''Feelings have become lifeless.''

1466
01:34:38,372 --> 01:34:40,932
''The heart has shattered.''

1467
01:34:41,375 --> 01:34:47,439
''Please tell us this
dream is not real.''

1468
01:35:05,666 --> 01:35:08,100
Karan, come. Please
share your project with us.

1469
01:35:10,337 --> 01:35:11,599
l don't have a model.

1470
01:35:13,274 --> 01:35:16,710
And l haven't done any
research for this project.

1471
01:35:17,511 --> 01:35:19,979
But yes, l have made a house.

1472
01:35:20,548 --> 01:35:23,608
With my friends. Aplace
where we have lots of fun.

1473
01:35:25,019 --> 01:35:26,418
This house gave us two newfriends.

1474
01:35:27,621 --> 01:35:30,283
Abeggar and a worker boy.

1475
01:35:31,625 --> 01:35:33,991
Andtill today, with the
strength of our friendship..

1476
01:35:34,095 --> 01:35:35,722
..we could save our tree house.

1477
01:35:37,031 --> 01:35:40,000
This tree house wasn't
made of cement and sand.

1478
01:35:41,035 --> 01:35:42,059
Housesaren't made
of bricksand walls.

1479
01:35:42,636 --> 01:35:44,001
They are made of relationships.

1480
01:35:45,039 --> 01:35:49,635
Yes, the real raw material
of our house is that tree.

1481
01:35:51,445 --> 01:35:52,639
That tree has life too.

1482
01:35:54,048 --> 01:35:56,744
But it never stopped us
from makinga tree house.

1483
01:35:57,651 --> 01:36:00,745
Andtomorrow, even if you
fell it, it won't do anything.

1484
01:36:01,722 --> 01:36:05,021
The people that can prevent
the felling of the tree ask..

1485
01:36:05,126 --> 01:36:07,026
..what difference will it make.

1486
01:36:07,728 --> 01:36:08,752
lt's just a tree.

1487
01:36:09,663 --> 01:36:12,029
So, let's cut a tree today.

1488
01:36:12,233 --> 01:36:13,257
Andtomorrow, another.

1489
01:36:13,467 --> 01:36:16,129
And one by one, we
fell thousands of trees.

1490
01:36:16,804 --> 01:36:19,432
And we break those
countless nests made on them.

1491
01:36:24,478 --> 01:36:25,775
Tomorrow, our tree
will be felled too.

1492
01:36:28,716 --> 01:36:30,047
What difference does
it make to anyone?

1493
01:36:44,098 --> 01:36:45,725
Come, sir. Greetings, sir.

1494
01:36:45,833 --> 01:36:48,131
l don't trust that
silly man, Gupta, at all.

1495
01:36:49,503 --> 01:36:51,368
l will stand here,
and get this job done.

1496
01:36:53,340 --> 01:36:57,470
See. See. That's my influence.

1497
01:36:57,578 --> 01:36:59,443
There isn't a single child
from this building here.

1498
01:37:03,717 --> 01:37:04,741
Did you whistle?

1499
01:37:19,133 --> 01:37:22,466
This tree will give
me a heart attack.

1500
01:37:23,270 --> 01:37:24,294
Hey, children.

1501
01:37:25,573 --> 01:37:28,098
Children, come down.

1502
01:37:28,209 --> 01:37:30,177
We won't come down.

1503
01:37:30,678 --> 01:37:33,772
Come down, and l will do as you say.

1504
01:37:35,416 --> 01:37:36,747
Don't cut the tree.

1505
01:37:38,152 --> 01:37:39,176
What did you say?

1506
01:37:39,286 --> 01:37:42,414
Don't cut the tree.
Don't cut the tree.

1507
01:37:42,523 --> 01:37:44,184
Don't cut the tree.
Don't cut the tree.

1508
01:37:45,459 --> 01:37:47,120
l have had enough from you.

1509
01:37:47,561 --> 01:37:49,426
You don't know Bakshi.

1510
01:37:49,897 --> 01:37:51,125
Now, watch what l do.

1511
01:37:51,232 --> 01:37:52,256
Just watch.

1512
01:37:58,172 --> 01:37:59,196
Come on, surely something is wrong.

1513
01:38:19,627 --> 01:38:21,492
l will give you the
entire bonus that you require.

1514
01:38:21,929 --> 01:38:23,487
Get these children
down from the tree..

1515
01:38:23,597 --> 01:38:24,689
..and get them out of here.

1516
01:38:25,499 --> 01:38:26,523
Yes, sir.

1517
01:38:28,202 --> 01:38:31,365
Don't cut the tree.
Don't cut the tree.

1518
01:38:31,739 --> 01:38:33,229
Don't cut the tree.
Don't cut the tree.

1519
01:38:33,474 --> 01:38:36,409
Don't cut the tree.
Don't cut the tree.

1520
01:38:36,510 --> 01:38:38,307
Aunique battle is
beingfought in Mumbai.

1521
01:38:38,512 --> 01:38:39,774
On one side, are these children..

1522
01:38:39,880 --> 01:38:42,405
..who are encircling
the tree to save it.

1523
01:38:42,516 --> 01:38:44,507
Andare riskingtheir lives.

1524
01:38:44,618 --> 01:38:46,711
And on the other side, is
the city's famous builder..

1525
01:38:46,820 --> 01:38:47,844
..Bakshi Constructions.

1526
01:38:48,222 --> 01:38:49,587
So, Mr. Bakshi, why are
you behaving like this..

1527
01:38:49,690 --> 01:38:50,714
..with these children?

1528
01:38:50,824 --> 01:38:53,793
l have government's
permission to fell this tree.

1529
01:38:53,894 --> 01:38:55,361
And take a look at the
children these days.

1530
01:38:55,462 --> 01:38:57,555
They have resorted to hooliganism.

1531
01:38:57,665 --> 01:38:58,859
They are takingthe
law into their hands.

1532
01:38:58,966 --> 01:39:01,196
Bakshi Constructions
versus innocent children.

1533
01:39:01,302 --> 01:39:03,202
lnnocent? Naughty children.
- Even an lndia-Pakistan match..

1534
01:39:03,304 --> 01:39:05,636
..won't have such
an excitingtussle.

1535
01:39:05,739 --> 01:39:07,206
Now, we have to see if
these children can..

1536
01:39:07,308 --> 01:39:09,208
..save the tree or not.

1537
01:39:09,376 --> 01:39:11,207
We won't come down.
- Come down.

1538
01:39:11,312 --> 01:39:12,540
Leave from here.
- Come down.

1539
01:39:12,846 --> 01:39:13,870
Leave from here.

1540
01:39:14,581 --> 01:39:17,209
Yes.

1541
01:39:20,921 --> 01:39:22,218
We won't come down.

1542
01:39:22,323 --> 01:39:24,223
Leave from here. Go away.

1543
01:39:24,325 --> 01:39:26,850
We won't come down.
- Go away.

1544
01:39:32,666 --> 01:39:34,224
They will take you
to the police station.

1545
01:39:34,335 --> 01:39:36,496
Quickly come down.
- l am sorry, Mummy.

1546
01:39:37,271 --> 01:39:38,761
But l won't come down.

1547
01:39:39,273 --> 01:39:42,902
Laddu.
- Leave from here. Don't disturb me.

1548
01:39:43,010 --> 01:39:44,875
Ritesh, come down.
- Stop.

1549
01:39:45,279 --> 01:39:46,303
Come down.

1550
01:39:46,413 --> 01:39:47,846
Karan. Karan, come down.

1551
01:39:48,015 --> 01:39:49,346
Karan, come down now.

1552
01:39:51,285 --> 01:39:52,309
What are you doing here, Karan?

1553
01:39:52,619 --> 01:39:54,917
Tell them to come down right now.

1554
01:39:55,289 --> 01:39:56,779
Look, anyone can get hurt.

1555
01:39:57,024 --> 01:39:59,584
The tree will be
hurt if we come down.

1556
01:39:59,827 --> 01:40:01,658
Karan.
- Don't act too smart. - Leave me.

1557
01:40:01,762 --> 01:40:05,664
Carefully.

Karan, your friendsare
up there because of you.

1561
01:40:16,043 --> 01:40:17,874
lf you don't come down,
then they will fall too.

1562
01:40:18,645 --> 01:40:21,944
How can you be so
selfish for a tree house?

1563
01:40:22,850 --> 01:40:25,284
Get down. There are
better ways of doing this.

1564
01:40:25,386 --> 01:40:26,410
Please.

1565
01:40:28,689 --> 01:40:29,713

Keep everything ready.
l'll leave now. - Okay, sir.

1570

Hey, where didthat man go?

My tree.
- Ram, don't..

1572
01:41:41,128 --> 01:41:43,358
My tree.
- Son. - Start cutting from the top.

1573
01:41:43,464 --> 01:41:46,365
Don't cut my tree.
- Ram.

1574
01:41:46,467 --> 01:41:49,436
Hey, l don't want any
problem from you now.

1576
01:41:51,405 --> 01:41:53,373
Hey, woman. Take care
of your useless boy.

01:41:53,474 --> 01:41:55,101
Mother leave me. Mother.

1578
01:41:55,609 --> 01:42:01,377
Bakshi sir, l will never
give you a chance to complain.

01:42:01,482 --> 01:42:03,848
l will do everything
you tell me to do.

1580
01:42:04,151 --> 01:42:06,381
Don't cut our tree.

1581
01:42:06,620 --> 01:42:08,520
Don't destroy our dwelling place.

1582
01:42:08,722 --> 01:42:11,452
So, this tree house is
your dwelling place.

1583
01:42:11,825 --> 01:42:13,383
Okay. Come, son.

1584
01:42:13,494 --> 01:42:14,518
We won't cut it.

1585
01:42:15,429 --> 01:42:16,919
Have you made this tree house?
- Yes.

1586
01:42:17,030 --> 01:42:18,054
l have made it.

lt's your design.
- Yes.

01:42:21,168 --> 01:42:23,398
Now, you will cut it down.
Cut it down.

1589
01:42:23,837 --> 01:42:25,998
Mother. Mother.
- Pass the crowbar. Give it.

1590
01:42:26,707 --> 01:42:28,402
Mother. Mother.

1591
01:42:28,509 --> 01:42:30,409
Come on, cut it.

1592
01:42:31,445 --> 01:42:35,006
You have made this tree house,
and now you will cut it.

1593
01:42:35,449 --> 01:42:36,609
Did you understand?
- No.

1594
01:42:36,717 --> 01:42:39,015
Come on. Cut it in
front of everyone.

1595
01:42:39,119 --> 01:42:40,484
Right now. Come on, cut it.

1596
01:42:41,188 --> 01:42:44,021
Come on, otherwise l will
dismiss you both from the job.

1597
01:42:44,124 --> 01:42:46,422
Tell him. Tell him to cut it.

1598
01:42:46,527 --> 01:42:48,688
Otherwise, l will
dismiss you both from the job..

1599
01:42:48,795 --> 01:42:49,819
..andthrow you on the streets.

1600
01:42:49,930 --> 01:42:50,954
Tell him.

1601
01:42:51,131 --> 01:42:52,428
You stole the woodfrom my site..

1602
01:42:52,533 --> 01:42:54,433
..and made this tree house of yours.

1603
01:42:54,701 --> 01:42:56,430
Now, you will break it.

1604
01:43:01,842 --> 01:43:04,037
Climb up, and break
down the tree house.

1605
01:43:04,144 --> 01:43:05,441
Hey, woman, tell him.

1606
01:43:05,679 --> 01:43:06,703
Tell him.

1607
01:43:29,503 --> 01:43:30,902
Break it. Break it.

1608
01:44:57,591 --> 01:45:00,560
Mother. Mother.

1609
01:45:03,597 --> 01:45:04,689
Don't waste anymore time.

1610
01:45:04,798 --> 01:45:07,562
Quickly cut it down.
- Stop. Stop. Stop.

1611
01:45:08,135 --> 01:45:10,194
You don't have any
business here. Get lost. Come on.

1612
01:45:11,138 --> 01:45:13,003
l won't let you do anything wrong.

1613
01:45:13,607 --> 01:45:15,165
This tree, the leaves,
the branches..

1614
01:45:15,342 --> 01:45:16,570
God resides in all of them.

1615
01:45:17,611 --> 01:45:18,908
But you can't see Him.

1616
01:45:19,246 --> 01:45:20,804
Because you have
gone blind with greed.

1617
01:45:21,214 --> 01:45:23,205
l won't let you cut this tree.

1618
01:45:23,317 --> 01:45:24,579
Who are you to stop him?

1619
01:45:24,685 --> 01:45:25,879
Come on, let's go from here. No.

1620
01:45:26,086 --> 01:45:28,577
Patil, what do l pay you for?

1621
01:45:28,689 --> 01:45:29,917
You couldn't even
take care of a beggar.

1622
01:45:30,023 --> 01:45:31,047
Sir, l am really sorry.

1623
01:45:31,158 --> 01:45:32,819
Sir, he is mad,
insane. l will handle him.

1624
01:45:32,926 --> 01:45:33,950
Come on. Come, come.

1625
01:45:34,061 --> 01:45:37,827
Bakshi, you haven't
seen their penance.

1626
01:45:38,231 --> 01:45:39,323
But He has seen it.

1627
01:45:40,100 --> 01:45:41,761
This tree is their prayer.

1628
01:45:42,169 --> 01:45:45,263
And the Lord will never
let their efforts go in vain.

1629
01:45:45,372 --> 01:45:46,771
He will never let it go in vain.

1630
01:45:47,307 --> 01:45:48,331
Really.

1631
01:45:49,076 --> 01:45:51,909
You are very sure that
this tree won't be felled.

1632
01:45:52,646 --> 01:45:55,615
Thunder will befall upon me,
and l will be reduced to ashes..

1633
01:45:55,716 --> 01:45:56,740
..andthis tree will be saved.

1634
01:45:57,250 --> 01:45:58,615
There will be a heavy deluge..

1635
01:45:58,719 --> 01:46:02,621
..and l will drown, and
this tree will be saved.

1636
01:46:03,657 --> 01:46:05,625
Hey, beggar, don't move from here.

1637
01:46:06,326 --> 01:46:09,295
Stand right here, and l will
fell this tree in front of you.

1638
01:46:09,396 --> 01:46:11,694
Hey, silly man, what
are you waiting for?

1639
01:46:11,798 --> 01:46:12,822
Cut the tree.

1640
01:46:17,671 --> 01:46:20,071
No thunder fell on me till now.

1641
01:46:21,408 --> 01:46:22,773
Sir, this is hollow.

1642
01:46:23,009 --> 01:46:23,276
No matter what it is, cut it.

1643
01:46:23,276 --> 01:46:24,709
No matter what it is, cut it.

1644
01:46:33,086 --> 01:46:35,748
Sir, look at this..

1645
01:46:39,693 --> 01:46:40,990
Lord Ganesh in the tree.

1646
01:46:43,230 --> 01:46:45,892
Oh, God, this tree..

1647
01:46:47,167 --> 01:46:49,658
Look. Look there.

1648
01:46:50,237 --> 01:46:51,397
Lord Ganesh.

1649
01:46:51,938 --> 01:46:53,405
That'sa miracle.

1650
01:46:54,841 --> 01:46:55,933
He appeared himself.

1651
01:46:58,712 --> 01:47:01,806
Say, hail.
- Lord Ganesh.

1652
01:47:01,915 --> 01:47:04,349
Hail.
- Lord Ganesh.

1653
01:47:04,451 --> 01:47:07,079
Hail.
- Lord Ganesh.

1654
01:47:07,187 --> 01:47:10,020
Hail.

1655
01:47:10,257 --> 01:47:12,817
Hail.
- Lord Ganesh.

1656
01:47:12,926 --> 01:47:14,917
Hail.
- Lord Ganesh.

1657
01:47:15,028 --> 01:47:18,759
Say it aloud.
- Hail. - Lord Ganesh.

1658
01:47:18,965 --> 01:47:23,231
l love nature. l love nature.

1659
01:47:26,273 --> 01:47:28,070
Our tree is saved.
- Yes.

1660
01:47:29,743 --> 01:47:31,005
Priya, show me the bag.

1661
01:47:31,745 --> 01:47:32,769
Bag.

1662
01:47:35,749 --> 01:47:39,344
Pictures of Lord Ganesh. Wow.

1663
01:47:42,823 --> 01:47:44,085
Are these Ravan's weapons?

1664
01:47:44,758 --> 01:47:45,782
These are not weapons.

1665
01:47:46,493 --> 01:47:47,858
They are tools for making idols.

1666
01:47:49,763 --> 01:47:50,787
Which means..

1667
01:47:53,066 --> 01:47:54,931
'Till now, we have saved the tree.'

1668
01:47:56,069 --> 01:47:58,196
'l am completely
sure that we will win.'

1669
01:47:59,139 --> 01:48:02,802
Now, no one will fell your tree.

1670
01:48:05,512 --> 01:48:08,413
l am going back to my house.

1671
01:48:13,186 --> 01:48:14,210
Yes.

1672
01:48:19,125 --> 01:48:21,093
Yes.

1673
01:48:33,807 --> 01:48:36,776
'After the charade, l
finally breatheda sigh of relief.'

1674
01:48:37,077 --> 01:48:39,773
'The shrewdness of Ravan
andthe children saved me.'

1675
01:48:39,980 --> 01:48:44,417
'Yes, people, l am that good
lookingtree with curly leaves.'

1676
01:48:44,818 --> 01:48:48,254
'Andthe donation is collected
in the temple in my belly.'

1677
01:48:48,421 --> 01:48:50,184
'And with that money,
Ram goes to school..'

1678
01:48:50,423 --> 01:48:52,323
'..as he wants to be an architect.'

1679
01:48:52,492 --> 01:48:53,516
Go carefully.

1680
01:48:54,027 --> 01:48:55,460
lt wasa miracle.

1681
01:48:55,562 --> 01:48:57,792
Lord Ganesh gave me a sign. - lt
finally resulted in a happy ending.

1682
01:48:57,898 --> 01:48:59,798
Their friendship turned into love.

1683
01:49:07,173 --> 01:49:08,197
Grandpa.

1684
01:49:11,044 --> 01:49:14,536
'And our Ravan,
which is Sudhir Apte..'

1685
01:49:14,848 --> 01:49:17,817
'..returnedto his
house after saving me.'

1686
01:49:18,151 --> 01:49:20,949
'Now, he narrates his
story to his grandson too..'

1687
01:49:21,054 --> 01:49:23,818
'..but doesn't tell him
the secret of Lord Ganesh.'

1688
01:49:28,995 --> 01:49:31,828
'But not every tree
is fortunate like me.'

1689
01:49:32,265 --> 01:49:35,996
'Because not everyone is our
protector, like these children.'

1690
01:49:36,970 --> 01:49:40,371
'Everyday they are cut,
felledand are vanishing.'

1691
01:49:41,241 --> 01:49:42,970
'Won't you still do anything?'

1692
01:49:46,246 --> 01:49:48,840
'The future
generation will never know..'

1693
01:49:48,949 --> 01:49:51,850
'..the footsteps of the trees,
the swaying of the leaves..'

1694
01:49:51,952 --> 01:49:53,852
'..the droplets of rain.'

1695
01:49:54,220 --> 01:49:56,848
'This part of your
world will be no more.'

1696
01:49:57,223 --> 01:49:59,191
'Put in your best efforts.
Save them.'

1697
01:49:59,893 --> 01:50:02,521
'Or this saga won't survive.'

1698
01:50:02,896 --> 01:50:04,022
'This saga won't survive.'

1699
01:50:18,445 --> 01:50:22,404
''Come on, pull it off.''

1700
01:50:30,924 --> 01:50:34,553

''When there's unity..''

1714
01:51:39,492 --> 01:51:43,952
''Unity makes one stronger.''

1715
01:51:44,064 --> 01:51:47,591
''Stronger.''

1716
01:51:49,536 --> 01:51:53,370
''Afallen star, unintelligible..''

01:51:53,473 --> 01:51:57,170
''Life's difficult,
