Only after I cast a vote, then vote count began.

182
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:03,555
I will be there tomorrow.

183
00:16:03,555 --> 00:16:05,033
We'll see what we can do.

184
00:16:05,033 --> 00:16:06,105
Okay.

185
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:08,819
- Mark!
- Ya.

186
00:16:08,819 --> 00:16:11,120
E-mail me the electoral law. I just wanted to read it.

187
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:11,752
Oh, okay.

188
00:16:11,752 --> 00:16:14,435
- Law of Election India! - Of course.

189
00:16:22,115 --> 00:16:23,832
He will not let you?

190
00:16:25,713 --> 00:16:29,946
Given the votes Sundar Ramaswamy, CEO GL, was sent by someone else ..

191
00:16:29,946 --> 00:16:31,891
..pakar law have already referred.

192
00:16:31,891 --> 00:16:33,627
Decisions need to be decided in court.

193
00:16:33,627 --> 00:16:35,113
You can learn all about ..

194
00:16:35,113 --> 00:16:36,788
..mencari troubleshooting ..

195
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:39,406
..membuat decision and consider it.

196
00:16:39,406 --> 00:16:42,604
Note the CEO's number one faced with this situation.

197
00:16:42,604 --> 00:16:44,783
You have to learn how corporate approach him.

198
00:16:44,783 --> 00:16:47,373
I am sure he will wear everyone!

199
00:17:41,336 --> 00:17:43,542
Not only the asset information!

200
00:17:43,868 --> 00:17:48,430
But the amount of money in each container and also charged on everyone!

201
00:17:48,515 --> 00:17:51,981
If it falls in the hands of another person in place at all!

202
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:52,842
Rendering!

203
00:17:52,867 --> 00:17:55,327
If this continues, we can not deal!

204
00:17:55,512 --> 00:18:02,530
If this is recorded by CCTV cameras, no one can breathe!

205
00:18:03,739 --> 00:18:05,393
Opening it.

206
00:18:32,429 --> 00:18:34,020
Do you remember how you ni James Bond huh?

207
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,411
James Bond ya!!

208
00:18:37,452 --> 00:18:39,106
Dirty dog!

210
00:18:51,357 --> 00:18:52,241

211
00:18:53,325 --> 00:18:55,896
You take a picture huh?

212
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:59,160
Take only pictures you brother!

213
00:18:59,228 --> 00:19:00,393
Sir!

214
00:19:01,776 --> 00:19:03,041
Mr ..

215
00:19:15,954 --> 00:19:16,853
Big.

216
00:19:16,853 --> 00:19:17,785
Tuan.

217
00:19:19,394 --> 00:19:22,573
They selesakah when I am here?

218
00:19:22,573 --> 00:19:24,553
Of course. Why not man?

219
00:19:30,285 --> 00:19:31,841
He brought that girl back!

220
00:19:32,897 --> 00:19:34,576
They are asleep!

221
00:19:36,204 --> 00:19:37,918
They are being watched.

222
00:19:40,024 --> 00:19:41,727
She broke the lies of us!

223
00:19:43,591 --> 00:19:45,308
Yes! Uncle has arrived!

224
00:19:46,252 --> 00:19:47,246
Hi, kids!

225
00:19:47,246 --> 00:19:48,691
- How was the trip? - Everything is okay.

226
00:19:49,383 --> 00:19:50,842
- Hi mom! - Hi dear.

227
00:19:52,232 --> 00:19:53,230
Hi, grandma!

228
00:19:53,274 --> 00:19:54,684
- O .. - Uncle, come.

229
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:56,810
Thank you uncle.

230
00:19:56,810 --> 00:19:59,131
- Come, dear. - Come together, Nila.

231
00:20:02,748 --> 00:20:05,853
Why is this? Just get here you've already filed a suit!

232
00:20:05,853 --> 00:20:06,807
What else Mom?

233
00:20:06,807 --> 00:20:09,447
Should I come away from the United States and let people vote for me?

234
00:20:10,134 --> 00:20:13,062
- Hey, kids! Can not gift? - Yes, it's great.

235
00:20:13,377 --> 00:20:15,385
Hey, Nila lived. Tell her to sit down.

236
00:20:15,385 --> 00:20:17,806
At the present time, who won fairly?

237
00:20:17,806 --> 00:20:19,278
They all wear a strange logo.

238
00:20:19,278 --> 00:20:21,248
The public will select the logo they like!

239
00:20:21,248 --> 00:20:22,690
Such days have long gone.

240
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:25,129
Now, they pay to get the votes.

241
00:20:25,129 --> 00:20:26,748
Use a lot of money.

242
00:20:26,748 --> 00:20:28,405
Nobody who is 'clean'.

243
00:20:28,405 --> 00:20:30,047
How do you think everything is so

244
00:20:30,047 --> 00:20:32,004
My father was a good man!

245
00:20:32,739 --> 00:20:36,176
He took a little time. Sometimes I saw him take a little money only.

246
00:20:37,277 --> 00:20:40,186
- Family-friendly hotel. - Sorry, we forgot you were here!

247
00:20:40,315 --> 00:20:41,727
Come on. We eat dinner.

248
00:20:41,727 --> 00:20:43,339
Bring them a meal.

249
00:20:46,761 --> 00:20:48,842
Hey, apakhabar?

250
00:20:49,387 --> 00:20:50,593
Which sorts your sister?

251
00:20:50,593 --> 00:20:51,640
She is fine.

252
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,211
She is very happy.

253
00:21:12,673 --> 00:21:15,393
At 8.30 this morning, the vote count was started.

254
00:21:15,393 --> 00:21:18,401
Party members are beginning to revel AIMMK.

255
00:21:18,401 --> 00:21:22,086
Their party was leading in 234 polling centers.

256
00:21:22,086 --> 00:21:25,301
Masilamani former chief minister will be sworn in for a third time!

257
00:21:27,969 --> 00:21:29,532
Retreating all. Stand down!

258
00:21:30,239 --> 00:21:32,755
Hey! This day you come too?

259
00:21:32,755 --> 00:21:34,663
Who knows if I can help you.

260
00:21:34,663 --> 00:21:36,294
Okay. Mari.

261
00:21:36,912 --> 00:21:38,624
You will not come without reason.

262
00:21:38,624 --> 00:21:41,056
Your dad playing here. That's why, right?

263
00:21:41,705 --> 00:21:43,208
That is right, too.

264
00:21:43,777 --> 00:21:46,048
They start off vote there.

265
00:21:46,048 --> 00:21:48,941
My father was in the lead with 30,000 votes!

266
00:21:48,941 --> 00:21:50,052
Really?

267
00:21:50,773 --> 00:21:52,247
We heard yesterday.

268
00:21:52,247 --> 00:21:54,755
But we never thought you would be taken him to court.

269
00:21:54,755 --> 00:21:57,115
Looking for directions to postpone the vote count.

270
00:21:57,115 --> 00:21:58,705
But it's already started.

271
00:21:58,705 --> 00:22:02,597
Mr. Venkatesan has led with 30,000 votes.

272
00:22:04,016 --> 00:22:07,024
Then do not announce the decision in that region alone.

273
00:22:07,299 --> 00:22:09,750
Only after I enter my vote ..

274
00:22:10,618 --> 00:22:12,401
..barulah you can announce it officially.

275
00:22:12,401 --> 00:22:14,824
- Is it possible? - No.

276
00:22:15,031 --> 00:22:18,694
The law states that everyone should include the voter's card.

277
00:22:18,694 --> 00:22:20,308
But her status as NRI.

278
00:22:20,308 --> 00:22:24,613
In addition to the voter's card, NRI also must submit a passport with him.

279
00:22:24,613 --> 00:22:28,102
Without all this, by allowing illegal votes were made ..

280
00:22:28,102 --> 00:22:29,346
.. it's a serious mistake.

281
00:22:29,346 --> 00:22:32,288
Therefore, the Election Commission has suspended 12 workers!

282
00:22:32,602 --> 00:22:35,050
The law not only punishes thieves.

283
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:37,661
But it is also to return the stolen goods.

284
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:41,369
If the voting rights is something precious in a democracy ..

285
00:22:41,561 --> 00:22:45,225
..and if it's stolen rights is not fair if he is reinstated?

286
00:22:45,225 --> 00:22:49,475
But, what changes can occur with one vote?

287
00:22:49,475 --> 00:22:50,387
Mr ..!

288
00:22:50,387 --> 00:22:52,348
Every vote is important, sir!

289
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:54,127
In America..

290
00:22:54,346 --> 00:22:57,618
To determine the official language of either English or German ..

291
00:22:57,618 --> 00:23:00,306
English ..bahasa been won by only one vote!

292
00:23:00,306 --> 00:23:04,624
Democracy in France win against military rule by one vote.

293
00:23:05,211 --> 00:23:06,033
Hitler!

294
00:23:06,033 --> 00:23:08,514
Being the head of the Nazi party, topped only by one vote.

295
00:23:08,514 --> 00:23:11,144
Washington became part of the United States with only one vote!

296
00:23:11,144 --> 00:23:15,239
Even Vajpayee government also fell by one vote.

297
00:23:16,667 --> 00:23:18,025
What are you talking about that right.

298
00:23:18,025 --> 00:23:23,238
That's why we created an awareness campaign to vote 6 months before the elections!

299
00:23:24,452 --> 00:23:25,794
The first rule:

300
00:23:25,794 --> 00:23:28,083
My voter ID card is checked.

301
00:23:28,083 --> 00:23:29,468
Rule number two:

302
00:23:29,468 --> 00:23:31,089
I am not a resident in India.

303
00:23:31,089 --> 00:23:33,608
My original passport must also be examined.

304
00:23:33,608 --> 00:23:36,987
The third rule. Section 49-P.

305
00:23:36,987 --> 00:23:40,251
Everyone knows about 49-0, but I'm talking about 49-P.

306
00:23:40,251 --> 00:23:43,436
Section 49-P in Indian electoral law ..

307
00:23:43,436 --> 00:23:46,829
..If vote was cast by others illegally ..

308
00:23:47,086 --> 00:23:49,421
.then they must be given a ballot paper ..

309
00:23:49,421 --> 00:23:51,698
..and be allowed to cast their vote!

310
00:23:53,611 --> 00:23:55,063
Is such a law exist?

311
00:23:55,063 --> 00:23:55,893
Ya.

312
00:23:55,893 --> 00:23:56,821
Really he said.

313
00:23:56,821 --> 00:23:58,467
Such laws do exist.

314
00:23:58,661 --> 00:24:03,109
You can find the section 49-P on Google with a mobile phone.

315
00:24:03,109 --> 00:24:06,613
But no one knows the existence of Section 49-P.

316
00:24:06,613 --> 00:24:08,701
Yesterday I did not know, Your Honor.

317
00:24:08,701 --> 00:24:11,642
10 years ago, people did not know the existence of section 49-O.

318
00:24:11,642 --> 00:24:13,647
But now everyone knows, right?

319
00:24:13,647 --> 00:24:14,844
NOTE.

320
00:24:15,553 --> 00:24:17,836
By the same token, they also must learn about 49-P!

321
00:24:18,084 --> 00:24:20,873
Compared to tell that such a law exists ..

322
00:24:20,873 --> 00:24:23,891
..If you convey this sensation decision ..

323
00:24:23,891 --> 00:24:26,003
truths, very deep within a day, the whole of India would know.

324
00:24:27,114 --> 00:24:31,761
But he's already ahead of Being 30,000 votes.

325
00:24:32,108 --> 00:24:32,889
Tuan.

326
00:24:32,889 --> 00:24:35,558
A vote may not bring any change in the area.

327
00:24:35,558 --> 00:24:39,066
But this decision will emphasize the importance of every vote.

328
00:24:40,318 --> 00:24:42,498
Not only in the legal books in the future ..

329
00:24:42,498 --> 00:24:46,108
..but it would be in the syllabus of law students.

330
00:24:46,108 --> 00:24:47,976
The case will be in the exam.

331
00:24:47,976 --> 00:24:49,890
And your name will be the answer.

332
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:03,568
It is the responsibility of the courts to ensure that every citizen ..

333
00:25:03,568 --> 00:25:07,563
..sedar about the rights they need to perform ..

334
00:25:07,563 --> 00:25:11,688
With this result, public awareness will increase.

335
00:25:11,688 --> 00:25:15,225
Even during the counting of votes in the recent piihanraya ..

336
00:25:15,225 --> 00:25:18,105
..kes Mr. Sudar already discussed by the media.

337
00:25:18,105 --> 00:25:21,922
Through it, everyone will be aware of the existence of Section 49-P.

338
00:25:22,186 --> 00:25:25,371
Although the vote to have been made by an unauthorized person ..

339
00:25:25,371 --> 00:25:29,249
..dibawah Section 49-P, ballots must be delivered to him.

340
00:25:29,456 --> 00:25:31,795
It is a mistake if we fail to do so.

341
00:25:31,795 --> 00:25:33,658
To correct this error ..

342
00:25:33,658 --> 00:25:37,168
sopand voted the same space, the same school ..

343
00:25:37,168 --> 00:25:40,891
..I hereby directs that the ballot must be returned to you.

344
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:45,572
Only after you vote is carried out ..

345
00:25:45,572 --> 00:25:48,836
..barulah election results will be announced in this area.

346
00:25:50,228 --> 00:25:53,094
Given that this is the fifth day after the working day at school ..

347
00:25:53,094 --> 00:25:56,695
..undian will be made on Saturday at the same place votes.

348
00:25:56,695 --> 00:26:00,784
Court and the Election Commission announced ..

00:26:00,784 --> 00:26:03,243
you may use to vote for you on the day.

350
00:26:03,686 --> 00:26:05,313
Sensation!

351
00:26:05,396 --> 00:26:07,919
Thankfully you've got it back.

352
00:26:08,522 --> 00:26:11,722
AIMMK party members continue partying ..

353
00:26:11,722 --> 00:26:13,655
..meraikan victory in the election of their leaders.

354
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:16,270
But, our brothers from America, Mr. Sundar had allowed ..

355
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:17,720
We have won, right?

356
00:26:19,534 --> 00:26:21,827
I did not sleep all night. Now I am very hungry.

357
00:26:22,216 --> 00:26:25,227
Lunch can be an invitation from the Chairman Infoware.

sopand sending the bill to charge several lakhs of rupees.

364
00:26:41,565 --> 00:26:43,588
Several lakhs only for one vote, sir?

365
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:48,912
Office of the District Officer in there, sir.

366
00:26:52,078 --> 00:26:53,546

They are unable to pay 25,000 rupees to the moneylender.

369
00:27:02,458 --> 00:27:03,750
I was there.

370
00:27:13,763 --> 00:27:16,337
Their children did not budge an inch, sir.

371
00:27:18,431 --> 00:27:20,776
They just stood looking at their father.

372
00:27:31,692 --> 00:27:33,562

00:27:52,933 --> 00:27:55,980
He was taken to hospital with half his body on fire.

378
00:27:56,581 --> 00:27:58,382
The government did not take action?

379
00:27:58,382 --> 00:27:59,671
Yes, sir.

380
00:27:59,671 --> 00:28:02,164
The next day, they put the fire engine outside.

381
00:28:02,164 --> 00:28:03,396
Fire engine?

00:28:03,643 --> 00:28:06,131
What to do with loan sharks fire engine?

383
00:28:06,131 --> 00:28:09,756
Only people who do not want to see others die alone will solve the problem.

384
00:28:09,756 --> 00:28:11,721
They do not want anyone dying on the ground,

385
00:28:11,721 --> 00:28:13,278
..and fire engine is the solution.

386
00:28:14,469 --> 00:28:16,665
What the public do when all this happened?

387
00:28:16,665 --> 00:28:18,847
They submit in WhatsApp, sir.

388
00:28:18,847 --> 00:28:19,843
In Whatsapp?

389
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:23,390
They are sending a message on this point in whatssapp.

390
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:24,439
And those who receive it anyway?

391
00:28:24,439 --> 00:28:28,626
They will submit to more people, and so on.

392
00:28:28,829 --> 00:28:29,768
And after that?

393
00:28:29,768 --> 00:28:32,875
Another issue will arise and we will continue to extend the message too.

394
00:28:37,635 --> 00:28:39,311
Here, the problem is not a solution.

395
00:28:39,311 --> 00:28:40,905
They just need one more problem.

396
00:28:44,983 --> 00:28:47,336

00:31:23,414 --> 00:31:25,157
But politicians?

00:31:25,649 --> 00:31:28,834
You want us to serve after spending so much money?

439
00:31:29,111 --> 00:31:32,043

00:31:38,408 --> 00:31:39,196
Forgive me.

444
00:31:40,798 --> 00:31:44,940
You say money is the similarities that exist in all of us.

445
00:31:46,144 --> 00:31:48,419
Wrong. You dah wrong.

446
00:31:48,582 --> 00:31:52,292
The equation that we have is people.

447
00:31:52,638 --> 00:31:53,986
Public support.

448
00:31:54,202 --> 00:31:55,262
You know not?

449
00:31:55,763 --> 00:31:58,861
Wide audience TV channels.

450
00:31:58,861 --> 00:32:02,691
Business customers. Voters for political leaders.

451
00:32:02,691 --> 00:32:06,433
Passenger plane. Printed media reader.

452
00:32:06,433 --> 00:32:07,495
You know?

453
00:32:07,495 --> 00:32:11,185
But, the word to describe them is 'people'.

454
00:32:11,356 --> 00:32:12,546
Person.

455
00:32:13,253 --> 00:32:15,838
Alms given by them to us.

The words of a great master.

459
00:32:25,398 --> 00:32:27,724
That's what I mean, just use a different paragraph.

460
00:32:27,911 --> 00:32:29,959
We take money from the public.

461
00:32:29,959 --> 00:32:32,027
While you were taken from your customers.

462
00:32:32,511 --> 00:32:35,029
But still too equation is money, right?

463
00:32:35,691 --> 00:32:38,098
Television focuses on faces in my head ..

464
00:32:38,098 --> 00:32:41,299
kror ..yang've got 4 votes in all 234 districts.

465
00:32:41,299 --> 00:32:44,778
They also focus on the youth vote was stolen.

466
00:32:44,778 --> 00:32:46,965
Will it affect us?

467
00:32:46,994 --> 00:32:49,832
Did he go to court to save the country?

468
00:32:49,832 --> 00:32:52,007
Every time his name was mentioned on TV they emphasize that she is ..

469
00:32:52,007 --> 00:32:55,042
GL CEO , GL CEO.

470
00:32:55,042 --> 00:32:56,378

00:35:24,151 --> 00:35:26,180
One important thing, uncle.

516
00:35:26,205 --> 00:35:28,510
I do not want to tell him, so I told my uncle.

517
00:35:28,541 --> 00:35:29,931

Crazy man.

525
00:35:42,053 --> 00:35:45,318
Because of him, they delay the counting of votes in areas Venkatesh.

526
00:35:45,318 --> 00:35:47,264
That's the main reason why my uncle phone.

527
00:35:47,507 --> 00:35:49,142
He's not a regular guy.

528
00:35:49,788 --> 00:35:51,708
He is very clever and cunning.

529
00:35:51,882 --> 00:35:53,811
Who cares about him?

530
00:35:54,116 --> 00:35:56,165
The trick he will not succeed against us!

531
00:35:56,165 --> 00:35:58,747
No. Uncle did not know him.

532
00:35:58,876 --> 00:36:00,570
Last year, he came to Canada.

533
00:36:00,743 --> 00:36:02,190
He stayed here for 3 weeks.

534
00:36:02,446 --> 00:36:06,571
The third week, he became the focus of all media.

535
00:36:06,602 --> 00:36:08,750
He's top of the well-known IT company.

536
00:36:08,775 --> 00:36:10,195
Whoops!

22 thousand workers ..

539
00:36:14,737 --> 00:36:16,169
..and he left the country.

540
00:36:16,539 --> 00:36:18,758
The effect is still felt to this day.

541
00:36:18,758 --> 00:36:20,778
Do not provoke him.

542
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:25,674
However, we have to win in all areas. Right?

543
00:36:25,674 --> 00:36:28,625
He is only one vote away!

544
00:36:28,625 --> 00:36:30,211
Just listen to me.

545
00:36:30,219 --> 00:36:33,632
Three government had prevented him from coming to their country.

546
00:36:34,228 --> 00:36:36,669
Never mess with her uncle.

547
00:36:37,503 --> 00:36:38,788
Okay dear.

548
00:36:38,807 --> 00:36:40,462
Uncle say something that to him?

549
00:36:41,384 --> 00:36:43,745
No. Uncle did not say a word to him!

550
00:36:43,745 --> 00:36:44,719
Thankfully.

551
00:36:44,719 --> 00:36:47,900
Do not interrupt him until he left India.

552
00:36:49,017 --> 00:36:51,497
- Goodbye, uncle. - Goodbye My Love.

553
00:36:55,947 --> 00:36:59,574
I think I have to say something off drinking morning!

554
00:36:59,744 --> 00:37:04,815
But did not he smoked and smiled during I go from there?

555
00:37:05,149 --> 00:37:09,362
There sesuatukah behind her smile?

556
00:37:09,575 --> 00:37:14,061
We are proud CEO GL are citizens of this country, sir!

557
00:37:14,061 --> 00:37:17,628
Some say that the owner of the master pay votes.

558
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:26,573
I do not be ashamed to buy votes is mine.

559
00:37:26,597 --> 00:37:28,411
But it is the state that should be ashamed.

560
00:37:29,123 --> 00:37:32,327
I only pay my lawyer. Rather than judge.

561
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:36,341
It's just one vote only. With him, what ..

562
00:37:36,341 --> 00:37:38,333
What am I going to accomplish? Right?

563
00:37:38,878 --> 00:37:40,022
Ya, tuan.

564
00:37:40,081 --> 00:37:42,586
Did you see that? He's a journalist.

565
00:37:42,586 --> 00:37:45,432
He asked what I would accomplish by just one vote?

566
00:37:45,589 --> 00:37:49,369
Some people pretend to be Sundar Ramaswamy and go vote.

567
00:37:49,957 --> 00:37:51,840
The Government believes that it is valid.

568
00:37:51,964 --> 00:37:54,929
If I just hug the body and dropped it ..

569
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:58,180
..macam where women want to believe and want to marry me?

570
00:37:58,204 --> 00:38:02,128
So, the guy who does not care about his vote is taken by someone else ..

571
00:38:02,128 --> 00:38:05,356
..juga will not do anything if people do evil on their wives?

572
00:38:05,356 --> 00:38:06,436
Certainly.

573
00:38:06,436 --> 00:38:07,217
Tuan.

574
00:38:07,217 --> 00:38:11,187
Do you try to provoke others to vote was stolen?

575
00:38:11,436 --> 00:38:12,707
Who asked the question?

576
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,290
Pat. Pat all.

577
00:38:19,918 --> 00:38:21,334
I tried to incite them, man!

578
00:38:21,334 --> 00:38:22,383
You are right.

579
00:38:22,916 --> 00:38:26,414
When I get back my vote. it has become a law.

580
00:38:26,563 --> 00:38:29,001
When a decision is made in this case ..

581
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:33,123
.then the same decision would be taken if such cases arise.

582
00:38:33,251 --> 00:38:36,395
What I received will be accepted by others as well!

583
00:38:36,758 --> 00:38:39,125
Although Section 49-P know it existed ..

584
00:38:39,173 --> 00:38:41,638
..macam where if they do not want to regain their votes?

585
00:38:41,638 --> 00:38:44,068
If someone let someone else vote for them ..

586
00:38:44,068 --> 00:38:47,597
..I have just mentioned what kind of men they were.

587
00:38:48,158 --> 00:38:50,618
There are manners to mention it. Why do I say with pride?

588
00:38:50,822 --> 00:38:53,947
How are they gonna do? Some of us do not have a brain.

589
00:39:06,026 --> 00:39:07,059
Sorry. Sorry.

590
00:39:07,059 --> 00:39:09,370
Please sit down. Sorry. I am sorry.

591
00:39:09,537 --> 00:39:11,586
Half of us are smart.

592
00:39:14,173 --> 00:39:15,354
You see one?

593
00:39:15,473 --> 00:39:18,681
What I have just said, similar to what I said earlier.

594
00:39:18,716 --> 00:39:20,448
At first you're denied.

595
00:39:20,505 --> 00:39:21,981
Now you're all silent.

596
00:39:22,006 --> 00:39:26,488
The same. When a matter is referred to the negative tone ..

597
00:39:26,488 --> 00:39:28,921
damning piece will act immediately.

598
00:39:30,523 --> 00:39:33,483
This is called a 'marketing'.

599
00:39:37,370 --> 00:39:39,627
Puffed up her right! Speaking with pride!

600
00:39:39,643 --> 00:39:41,260
Some people have voted for me too!

601
00:39:41,314 --> 00:39:44,071
According to section 49-P, they have to return my vote too!

602
00:39:44,073 --> 00:39:45,366
As if she's someone special!

603
00:39:45,366 --> 00:39:48,847
He said, people who sell votes will not defend his wife!

604
00:39:50,753 --> 00:39:54,628
If you are looking to Section 49-P on Google they have complete details about it!

605
00:39:54,776 --> 00:39:57,174
When a decision is made in this case ..

606
00:39:57,174 --> 00:40:01,137
.then the same decision would be taken if such cases arise.

607
00:40:01,159 --> 00:40:03,665
What I received will be accepted by others as well!

608
00:40:03,707 --> 00:40:06,589
Any video that is played will be a video speech in advance!

609
00:40:06,675 --> 00:40:08,325
It has been so.

610
00:40:08,355 --> 00:40:09,854
She works outside the country, right?

611
00:40:09,871 --> 00:40:11,964
Corporate man came here to get her vote back!

612
00:40:12,003 --> 00:40:14,222
There are a lot of votes in Kallakurichi built illegally!

613
00:40:14,238 --> 00:40:15,456
We must reclaim it!

614
00:40:15,488 --> 00:40:17,659
Many votes in Pollachi made illegally.

615
00:40:17,699 --> 00:40:19,511
We have to get our votes back!

616
00:40:19,527 --> 00:40:22,308
Some people are willing to file a case.

617
00:40:22,333 --> 00:40:25,474
Unfortunately they have no money. We have to accept as well!

618
00:40:27,402 --> 00:40:29,589
Legislation Trichy college students already go to the website.

619
00:40:29,949 --> 00:40:31,495
If the votes were illegally ..

620
00:40:31,519 --> 00:40:34,882
..they will file a case if we provide Aadhar card and voter ID data.

621
00:40:34,882 --> 00:40:38,179

28 thousand people have filed cases!

625

The numbers are increasing.

626
00:40:47,134 --> 00:40:50,601
Previously Mr. Masilamani can form a government ..

627
00:40:50,601 --> 00:40:53,034

They demanded to get back their votes.

- Good .. - Thank you sir.

638
00:41:38,793 --> 00:41:41,262
They are a junior lawyer in the office of the lawyer Jethmalani.

639
00:41:41,287 --> 00:41:44,098
Together with my case, they'll take care of this case as well.

640
00:41:44,161 --> 00:41:47,283
For now, no one can know I'm involved.

641
00:41:47,283 --> 00:41:48,435
Hey, all ..

642
00:41:49,428 --> 00:41:51,997
I call all because there is an important reason

643
00:41:52,857 --> 00:41:54,294
This place is my home.

644
00:41:54,794 --> 00:41:57,763
There's a problem arises during this visit.

645
00:41:58,498 --> 00:42:00,930
Maybe then I eat a week back.

646
00:42:01,371 --> 00:42:03,285
I have a lot of work here.

647
00:42:03,912 --> 00:42:04,912
So..

648
00:42:05,435 --> 00:42:10,150
Therefore, you can all go back today. At this time.

649
00:42:10,321 --> 00:42:11,282
Mr. Sundar.

650
00:42:11,282 --> 00:42:13,399
We are facing a problem of taste host. But we need the master.

651
00:42:13,399 --> 00:42:15,154
Sir, do not worry.

652
00:42:15,232 --> 00:42:18,774
As long as we're here, no one can not hurt you.

653
00:42:23,239 --> 00:42:24,198
Wide that all?

654
00:42:24,198 --> 00:42:25,271
No sir.

655
00:42:25,302 --> 00:42:27,970
Although we were not here, no one can touch you.

656
00:42:31,544 --> 00:42:32,653
Okay.

657
00:42:32,763 --> 00:42:34,153
You all go home.

658
00:42:34,216 --> 00:42:35,822
I also convey a message dah ..

659
00:42:35,958 --> 00:42:37,826
..I will be back here when all'm done.

660
00:42:54,873 --> 00:42:56,974
I do not do much when girls give me a warning.

661
00:42:56,999 --> 00:42:59,165
You should not have let it go this far.

662
00:42:59,811 --> 00:43:02,138
A total of 2,000 people in each area have filed cases.

663
00:43:02,279 --> 00:43:03,987
Why did not you tell me sooner?

664
00:43:05,475 --> 00:43:07,044
I never thought this would happen, Appu.

665
00:43:08,584 --> 00:43:11,130
The oath taking ceremony will be held tomorrow.

666
00:43:11,404 --> 00:43:13,730
He can not make a scene.

667
00:43:13,991 --> 00:43:15,498
It must be done tomorrow.

668
00:43:15,555 --> 00:43:17,391
You can not force more ..

669
00:43:17,391 --> 00:43:18,953
..but you dah nak kill people?

670
00:43:19,827 --> 00:43:23,305
Killing is not necessarily going to be a solution, Mr. Rendu.

671
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:25,092
If a person was killed ..

672
00:43:25,451 --> 00:43:28,311
..parti must use it to raise fear.

673
00:43:28,599 --> 00:43:30,840
The limbs must be in chopping.

674
00:43:31,029 --> 00:43:32,434
I'll call you when a task is completed.

675
00:43:32,941 --> 00:43:34,901
The police can not come immediately.

676
00:43:35,036 --> 00:43:37,122
Let the corpse lying in the road for some while.

677
00:43:37,333 --> 00:43:40,644
Let the people take pictures and spread it on the phone.

678
00:43:40,841 --> 00:43:42,845
Then other people will fear.

679
00:43:59,093 --> 00:44:01,924
Do you feel attracted to me?

680
00:44:03,924 --> 00:44:05,290
What's wrong with you guys?

681
00:44:05,588 --> 00:44:06,943
You're okay, right?

682
00:44:07,447 --> 00:44:08,447
Come on!

683
00:44:08,853 --> 00:44:11,229
Do you feel attracted to me?

684
00:44:11,721 --> 00:44:14,383
I want to ask you for this.

685
00:44:14,510 --> 00:44:17,413
But hard-nak conference alone.

686
00:44:18,373 --> 00:44:20,071
So why talk like this?

687
00:44:21,466 --> 00:44:24,993
Children learn English in school.

688
00:44:25,108 --> 00:44:28,717
So the secret must be spoken in dialect classic.

689
00:44:28,764 --> 00:44:31,696
Tamil classic for secret talks in Tamil Nadu!

690
00:44:31,717 --> 00:44:33,850
And that's spoken by young politicians!

691
00:45:28,653 --> 00:45:29,972
Instant yes.

692
00:45:31,982 --> 00:45:34,386
They point you to kill the target ..

693
00:45:34,386 --> 00:45:36,908
..or just to bully it?

694
00:45:38,085 --> 00:45:39,858
If the directive is to bluff ..

695
00:45:40,608 --> 00:45:42,455
they ..beritahu me shudder!

696
00:45:44,467 --> 00:45:45,974
They do not point to bully you.

697
00:45:46,482 --> 00:45:48,248
They told us to delete you.

698
00:45:49,170 --> 00:45:50,482
Not you alone.

699
00:45:59,681 --> 00:46:00,524
Twitch

700
00:46:01,501 --> 00:46:02,936
Touch it.

701
00:48:44,789 --> 00:48:47,482
You can not stay here anymore. Go back to America.

702
00:48:52,462 --> 00:48:53,462
Hello.

703
00:48:54,282 --> 00:48:55,282
Really?

704
00:48:56,118 --> 00:48:57,118
Wide that all?

705
00:48:58,814 --> 00:48:59,814
Really?

706
00:49:01,825 --> 00:49:03,780
Continue to look at him!

707
00:49:04,044 --> 00:49:07,153
Do not arrest him. I'm on my way.

708
00:49:09,583 --> 00:49:10,622
Why?

709
00:49:11,208 --> 00:49:14,214
We have found the man responsible for all this.

710
00:49:14,598 --> 00:49:15,864
Who? Either Dad?

711
00:49:15,895 --> 00:49:17,234
No. It is not!

712
00:49:18,043 --> 00:49:22,190
We found where the guy who voted for you, that is!

713
00:49:22,686 --> 00:49:23,943
Who is that man?

714
00:49:24,366 --> 00:49:26,483
Really wants to see him!

715
00:49:31,385 --> 00:49:32,262
Hey, buddy!

716
00:49:32,410 --> 00:49:33,689
Only alcohol served to upset the family, right?

717
00:49:33,714 --> 00:49:36,362
Fermented rice to cool. How it can burn down the house?

718
00:49:36,362 --> 00:49:39,450
Anything that no alcohol in it will damage the household.

719
00:49:39,784 --> 00:49:40,627

720
00:49:40,659 --> 00:49:42,658

I've done quite a vote without knowing the name of their owner, friend!

736
00:50:12,588 --> 00:50:14,294
You are one of thousands of it!

00:50:16,023 --> 00:50:18,198

For one vote, I flew with a private plane as a controller!

742
00:50:28,101 --> 00:50:31,014
For such a small task, why should God take Muneshwaran?

743
00:50:31,014 --> 00:50:33,447
Guard means security!

744

894
01:00:08,469 --> 01:00:10,235
He does not understand our language.

895
01:00:10,336 --> 01:00:13,647
Elections were unconstitutional shall be considered invalid.

896
01:00:13,647 --> 01:00:15,157
Elections must be held!

897
01:00:15,290 --> 01:00:16,895
Re-election is not a joke.

898
01:00:16,915 --> 01:00:19,579
It involves a lot of work. Do you know how expenses will be issued?

899
01:00:19,579 --> 01:00:21,820
To catch a thief who stole 1,000 rupees ..

900
01:00:22,024 --> 01:00:24,139
..pihak police will spend 10,000 rupees.

901
01:00:24,165 --> 01:00:26,534
If you only think to save 9,000 rupees ..

902
01:00:26,923 --> 01:00:29,243
sopand will continue to be a lifelong thief, Your Honor.

903
01:00:29,735 --> 01:00:31,730
This is not the time to think spending.

904
01:00:31,730 --> 01:00:33,402
But the time to save the people.

905
01:00:33,402 --> 01:00:34,878
What do you think the Election Commission?

906
01:00:34,878 --> 01:00:37,188
When he said his vote was made illegally ..

907
01:00:37,243 --> 01:00:38,987
..we gave him the right to vote again.

908
01:00:38,987 --> 01:00:42,432
But many people came forward and claimed that their votes were stolen.

909
01:00:42,432 --> 01:00:44,324
We can not just let him alone be able to vote ..

910
01:00:44,324 --> 01:00:46,230
..and deny the rights of others.

911
01:00:46,528 --> 01:00:50,392
Nearly two thousand people in each area who filed the case.

912
01:00:50,584 --> 01:00:54,924
There are some areas that wins the majority of votes between 800-1500.

913
01:00:55,061 --> 01:00:56,957
This is an opportunity to change it.

914
01:00:56,957 --> 01:00:58,652
Not only that, Yang Arif.

915
01:00:58,740 --> 01:01:02,828
Votes made illegally have also been included in the vote count.

916
01:01:02,881 --> 01:01:04,685
How do you separate them?

917
01:01:04,842 --> 01:01:05,997
Or even to reduce it?

918
01:01:06,069 --> 01:01:08,855
In the Tamil Nadu elections in 2016 ..

919
01:01:08,904 --> 01:01:11,490
..just made 2,60,000 votes to ..

920
01:01:11,708 --> 01:01:14,165
..membezakan winners and losers.

921
01:01:14,232 --> 01:01:18,563
But this time the person who filed the case over 3,45,000.

922
01:01:18,563 --> 01:01:21,045
You ask for their oath lifting event at the delay.

923
01:01:21,373 --> 01:01:24,309
But the ceremony was held at the residence of the Governor.

924
01:01:24,309 --> 01:01:26,319
Therefore, make a quick decision Your Honor.

925
01:01:26,319 --> 01:01:29,224

01:01:41,295 --> 01:01:43,591
..menang vote in Bareli.

931

There are allegations that are not good during piihanraya held ..

932
01:01:46,093 --> 01:01:51,593
.then Allahabad high court has to get rid of the parliament.

..and the right decision will be issued ..

936
01:02:00,737 --> 01:02:03,077
Just because some people are unethical ..

937
01:02:03,444 --> 01:02:06,761
..orang public should not lose confidence in democracy in India, Your Honor.

938

Yes, dear. Instant. This is it.

What can we do now?

986
01:04:51,643 --> 01:04:53,228
The whole country is watching, Dad.

987
01:04:53,631 --> 01:04:57,960
If we bediam themselves, the court decision will come true.

988
01:04:58,541 --> 01:05:00,225
Massive riots must be held.

989
01:05:00,486 --> 01:05:04,167
The plaintiffs. Members of the opposition. Everyone must fear.

990
01:05:04,167 --> 01:05:05,249
One more thing.

01:05:05,249 --> 01:05:08,567
If we miss Sundar today, he would go to America.

992
01:05:08,751 --> 01:05:11,812
He will return 15 days left to vote.

993
01:05:12,376 --> 01:05:14,235
If we create something to him when it ..

994
01:05:14,470 --> 01:05:16,677
..it will involve us with the police.

995
01:05:17,564 --> 01:05:19,997
We can not hurt her if she was in the United States.

996
01:05:20,378 --> 01:05:22,241
It must be done today. Right now.

997
01:05:23,595 --> 01:05:27,672
It must look like people or students who rioted.

998
01:05:27,672 --> 01:05:29,219
Do not miss her father.

999
01:05:29,564 --> 01:05:33,698
After he was killed, we will secure the party of government for 10 years.

1000
01:05:34,658 --> 01:05:38,423
Our enemy. Our allies. Everyone will be afraid of us!

1001
01:05:39,291 --> 01:05:43,773
Even members of our own party will submit to us!

01:05:49,752 --> 01:05:51,743
It looks like the work you've done.

1003

Mak.

1005
01:05:55,344 --> 01:05:57,141
Why talk like this when he was about to leave?

1006
01:05:57,407 --> 01:06:01,038
If he does not vote, he not respect his company.

1007
01:06:01,205 --> 01:06:04,642
Just because one thing he made all sorts of drama.

1008
01:06:04,642 --> 01:06:05,762
How many plans?

1009
01:06:07,484 --> 01:06:10,162

Every person who was lying on the bed rather than the patient, mother.

Each one of them is the Department.

1036

..ada 6 family members, including his parents.

1038
01:08:27,046 --> 01:08:29,793
He was the only breadwinner in the family.

01:08:30,207 --> 01:08:32,897
Working overtime and work during the holidays ..

1040
01:08:33,239 --> 01:08:35,675
He was bedridden for the past 4 months.

These small things.

1042
01:08:37,468 --> 01:08:40,492
When riding a bike, bus break governments.

1043
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:43,250
Because they appoint someone who is not qualified as a driver.

1044
01:08:43,335 --> 01:08:47,383
..they just blame the transportation services ..

1045

But here, the electric wires exposed to rain already killed three children.

1049
01:09:07,471 --> 01:09:11,747
While trying to save them, these workers lose both hands.

Department of electrical energy.

01:09:29,429 --> 01:09:31,989
Another child struggling to survive.

There are positions behind their woes mom!

01:09:49,593 --> 01:09:51,826
..for the 5 years they were in power!

1062
01:09:51,826 --> 01:09:54,601
I did this to get rid of their pride.

1063
01:09:55,643 --> 01:09:58,517
If they go back, I will fight back!

1064
01:09:58,823 --> 01:10:01,197
That is all! I do not care about other people.

1065

01:10:14,399 --> 01:10:16,733
Riots occurred in several places.

1069
01:10:16,733 --> 01:10:20,638
People are ordered to remain at home. People started to panic.

1070
01:10:21,694 --> 01:10:23,520
It seems there is no one at home.

1071

I came to talk alone.

1113
01:12:48,929 --> 01:12:51,612
No need to listen to your partners.

1114
01:12:52,273 --> 01:12:54,813
The law and the media is not like before.

1115

No matter when the crime was committed.

1116
01:12:57,726 --> 01:12:59,305
Very dangerous.

1117
01:12:59,617 --> 01:13:01,845
It is not easy to eliminate.

1118
01:13:03,117 --> 01:13:05,027
Crimes that you all do ..

They will kill you with that weapon!

1121
01:13:13,175 --> 01:13:14,352
Money.

1122
01:13:14,531 --> 01:13:18,317
It's okay if you see a lot of money accumulated in the container.

1123
01:13:18,553 --> 01:13:21,689
They will die without a chance to see the container!

1124
01:13:22,718 --> 01:13:26,689
So, in the golden age as you, you do the crime long ago ..

..akan for you arrested.

1126

01:13:32,892 --> 01:13:34,352
One of suffering.

1128

1130
01:13:39,811 --> 01:13:41,546
What are you going to achieve?

1131
01:13:41,546 --> 01:13:44,454
The swearing-in was delayed only 16 days.

1132
01:13:44,569 --> 01:13:46,428
Once again, we will win.

1133
01:13:46,811 --> 01:13:49,475
I was chairman of the third-generation politician!

1134
01:13:49,663 --> 01:13:52,219
Politics is so deeply ingrained in him for 55 years!

1135
01:13:52,303 --> 01:13:54,123
Needless to campaign or meeting!

1136
01:13:54,148 --> 01:13:56,216
Her face will suffice!

1137
01:13:57,538 --> 01:14:02,324
During his 55 year stay in our minds.

1138
01:14:02,390 --> 01:14:05,855
I was chairman of the face each product and each skim!

He is like our brand!

1141
01:14:14,076 --> 01:14:16,613
You do not know anything about the brand, right?

1142
01:14:16,613 --> 01:14:18,705
The face of our leaders is our brand!

1143
01:14:18,862 --> 01:14:21,346
With it, if dogs or donkeys represent us ..

1144
01:14:21,378 --> 01:14:23,378
elections truths, very deep, we will win.

1145
01:14:23,433 --> 01:14:26,247
We want to demonstrate? This is a challenge.

1146
01:14:28,907 --> 01:14:30,373
Oh, God..

1147
01:14:31,460 --> 01:14:32,789
It's extreme.

1148
01:14:34,149 --> 01:14:35,524
Mr. Rendu!

1149
01:14:36,670 --> 01:14:40,929
How can you be so arrogant despite being in second place ..

1150
01:14:40,929 --> 01:14:45,514
..and you're also the same name with the word "both".

1151
01:14:45,993 --> 01:14:48,610
Successfully passed the test, was selected in the interview ..

1152
01:14:48,635 --> 01:14:51,282
..and work in the country's first number one company ..

1153
01:14:51,477 --> 01:14:55,845
..duduk in key seats, should not I be proud?

1154
01:14:57,320 --> 01:15:00,798
Always be careful when challenged.

1155
01:15:01,274 --> 01:15:02,639
What do you say?

1156
01:15:03,813 --> 01:15:05,164
Brand huh?

1157
01:15:08,821 --> 01:15:12,929
Actually, I'm an expert in destroying the brand!

1158
01:15:14,884 --> 01:15:16,926
Now I'll create a challenge, Mr. Rendu!

1159
01:15:18,360 --> 01:15:20,360
Men's number one above you ..

1160
01:15:20,829 --> 01:15:22,840
Beloved leader you that!

1161
01:15:22,992 --> 01:15:25,540
I will destroy the brand.

1162
01:15:26,165 --> 01:15:28,664
Although the party did win again ..

1163
01:15:28,673 --> 01:15:31,856
..I would not justify the chairman you win!

1164
01:15:32,313 --> 01:15:38,213
In the area where he competed, I will fight it!

1165
01:15:39,165 --> 01:15:43,522
Watch Alone I will tear it into pieces of the brand!

1166
01:15:47,491 --> 01:15:48,946
Brother, lawyer says we can proceed.

1167
01:15:48,946 --> 01:15:50,046
Kill him!

1168
01:15:59,888 --> 01:16:01,286
I killed her brother.

1169
01:16:41,210 --> 01:16:43,496
Hey! Release him. Release him!

1170
01:16:44,458 --> 01:16:45,505
Let go of him!

1171
01:18:59,818 --> 01:19:00,845
Why, brother?

1172
01:19:01,639 --> 01:19:04,341
You want to play in my yard, right?

1173
01:19:04,489 --> 01:19:08,922
You remember this is a computer game that is played in the air-conditioning?

1174
01:19:09,240 --> 01:19:11,794
It involves blood, pain and soul!

1175
01:19:11,955 --> 01:19:15,679
I'll show you what the real political game!

1176
01:19:17,447 --> 01:19:21,749

01:19:32,387 --> 01:19:34,233
- What did you say? - Yes sir.

01:19:42,811 --> 01:19:45,498
I think they talked for 40 minutes.

1183
01:19:45,725 --> 01:19:47,369
After that, I went back home.

1184
01:19:47,369 --> 01:19:49,679

- It should be on my daughter. - Why is dad? Daddy sing?

1188
01:20:03,791 --> 01:20:06,384
When the father-in-law thought, make you want to sing.

1189
01:20:06,547 --> 01:20:08,424
Who is the father? Brother husband kah?

- Remind him now angry father .. - Not he.

Do not take the things done.

He went off in anger!

1217
01:21:14,948 --> 01:21:17,669
He was not angry, but he felt reluctant.

1218
01:21:17,777 --> 01:21:18,945
Uncle ..

1219
01:21:18,945 --> 01:21:21,890

I can not talk with the head of my uncle. - Why?

1229
01:21:43,344 --> 01:21:46,528
Because I competed against him in the area!

1230
01:22:09,757 --> 01:22:13,164
Those eyes. It was great.

1231
01:22:13,164 --> 01:22:16,438

Pictures of Aadhar cards not like your face.

1310
01:27:21,987 --> 01:27:24,189
Do not say that. I voted to use that card.

1311
01:27:24,761 --> 01:27:26,585

Not vice versa. - Whose fault is it?

1316
01:27:37,807 --> 01:27:39,807

Listen to that! Government officials themselves say, the government is at fault.

1320
01:27:48,830 --> 01:27:50,427
Does anybody hear me?

1321
01:27:50,427 --> 01:27:52,817
Sister, do not ruin my career.

1322
01:27:52,817 --> 01:27:56,135

If there is a problem with 10 people, there are 10 more others.

1329
01:28:11,662 --> 01:28:15,070
If 10 it was not possible, there are another 10 people.

1330
01:28:15,515 --> 01:28:17,562
Tell me if you need more, I can bring a truck.

1331
01:28:17,949 --> 01:28:19,808
All details are already complete.

1332
01:28:20,098 --> 01:28:21,827
Just as good as I go ..

01:28:42,715 --> 01:28:44,324
Tell us, Mr. Narayanan.

1337
01:28:44,324 --> 01:28:46,522
What about the rivalry between Mr. Sundar and Chief Minister?

1338
01:28:46,663 --> 01:28:48,546
I know them both.

1339
01:28:48,741 --> 01:28:51,374
The chief minister has won three times in the area.

1340
01:28:51,679 --> 01:28:55,589
But in the meantime, Mr. Sundar is a corporate giant.

1341
01:28:55,589 --> 01:28:56,529
Genghis Khan!

1342
01:28:56,529 --> 01:29:00,342
Strategies and tactics will definitely scary!

1343
01:29:00,367 --> 01:29:02,234
It is definitely a very intense competition.

1344
01:29:02,234 --> 01:29:03,851
It is not as tenaciously where.

1345
01:29:04,135 --> 01:29:05,851
He's still young.

1346
01:29:06,563 --> 01:29:08,158
But he is not wise!

1347
01:29:08,183 --> 01:29:10,684
He can kror salary of 1800 rupees!

1348
01:29:10,916 --> 01:29:12,658
In fact he wants to be more.

1349
01:29:12,683 --> 01:29:14,499
Get free publicity here!

1350
01:29:15,221 --> 01:29:19,520
Ask him how his company stock rise since two days ago.

1351
01:29:19,752 --> 01:29:21,511
There must be an increase.

1352
01:29:21,788 --> 01:29:24,913
Is Mr. Sundar doing this to raise its stock price ..

1353
01:29:24,913 --> 01:29:27,771
..or as there are good intentions? Only he can menjawapnya.

1354
01:29:31,033 --> 01:29:32,198
Really?

1355
01:29:36,264 --> 01:29:39,035
Mr. Sundar way here. He will come to the show.

1356
01:29:39,035 --> 01:29:42,508
While I invite you said just the two of us. This live event!

1357
01:29:42,508 --> 01:29:44,410
We did not think sir.

1358
01:30:04,168 --> 01:30:06,871
Rather than show my pictures and interviews by telephone ..

1359
01:30:07,098 --> 01:30:08,813
..saya himself will come!

1360
01:30:20,687 --> 01:30:22,509
He went to the TV station!

1361
01:30:27,813 --> 01:30:30,464
- Where do I want .. - Here. Please sit.

1362
01:30:36,368 --> 01:30:37,570
Talk.

1363
01:30:37,836 --> 01:30:39,223
Do you doubt?

1364
01:30:39,485 --> 01:30:42,383
People here can not do anything with their votes.

1365
01:30:42,383 --> 01:30:46,268
But you cause the state government with the votes that you do not do.

1366
01:30:46,643 --> 01:30:48,466
Pretty smart.

1367
01:30:48,518 --> 01:30:50,518
There are many marketing of your company.

1368
01:30:50,548 --> 01:30:54,011
And prove you are willing to do anything for your company, right?

1369
01:30:54,011 --> 01:30:55,789
If you doubt it ..

1370
01:30:56,087 --> 01:31:00,450
of normal today, I resign as CEO of the company.

1371
01:31:03,613 --> 01:31:04,767
How can he do that?

1372
01:31:04,949 --> 01:31:06,276
Do not do that, Mr. Sundar.

1373
01:31:07,066 --> 01:31:09,433
You're the CEO of GL, and make the country proud.

1374
01:31:09,487 --> 01:31:10,949
Tuan serious?

1375
01:31:10,949 --> 01:31:14,307
Small office at the company is a dream for some people of India.

1376
01:31:14,895 --> 01:31:16,346
You obviously do not?

1377
01:31:16,590 --> 01:31:18,693
The company is no longer my company.

1378
01:31:18,966 --> 01:31:20,418
Now what do you think?

1379
01:31:21,168 --> 01:31:22,569
That is all..

1380
01:31:22,870 --> 01:31:25,409
Actions like this will not help you win against my head.

1381
01:31:25,480 --> 01:31:30,613
The mind does not want any opposition is a threat to democracy.

1382
01:31:31,871 --> 01:31:35,048
Your belief for me gobsmacked.

1383
01:31:35,048 --> 01:31:37,661
Our Party, a great organization!

1384
01:31:37,661 --> 01:31:39,167
And you're just one person.

1385
01:31:39,208 --> 01:31:42,438
Mahatma Gandhi also alone when he was forced off the train!

1386
01:31:43,504 --> 01:31:45,793
Now, one person can be a group ..

1387
01:31:45,818 --> 01:31:48,502
..and one group can turn into one.

1388
01:31:50,160 --> 01:31:52,804
..just in one day, sir.

1389
01:31:54,932 --> 01:31:58,723
He's got spare time because I stopped working, I have many things to do.

1390
01:31:58,948 --> 01:31:59,958
I go first.

1391
01:32:00,153 --> 01:32:03,196
Hey! Turn off the camera. Stop recording.

1392
01:32:03,989 --> 01:32:05,351

1393
01:32:05,544 --> 01:32:07,144
I said outside recording.

1394
01:32:07,356 --> 01:32:11,513
Residents in the area are very angry because you were up against my head.

1395
01:32:11,683 --> 01:32:13,749
Do not go to Ayodhyakuppam.

1396
01:32:14,660 --> 01:32:16,901
In other places they will just burn the statue.

1397
01:32:16,926 --> 01:32:19,565
There they will burn people alive.

1398
01:32:20,770 --> 01:32:23,043
- What was the name of the place? - Ayodhyakuppam

1399
01:32:25,029 --> 01:32:26,751
My first encounter will be made there.

1400
01:32:52,628 --> 01:32:54,051
Please be quiet.

1401
01:32:54,051 --> 01:32:57,060
A warm reception.

1402
01:32:57,175 --> 01:32:59,636
Various they want us at any time!

1403
01:32:59,793 --> 01:33:01,269
Let go of this meeting.

1404
01:33:01,333 --> 01:33:03,237
You can make at home using Twitter right?

1405
01:33:03,261 --> 01:33:05,011
It's easier that way.

1406
01:33:08,081 --> 01:33:10,849
He said they will burn and chopping people.

1407
01:33:11,355 --> 01:33:13,081
Not seen any like that.

1408
01:33:13,191 --> 01:33:14,144
Listen.

1409
01:33:14,214 --> 01:33:16,355
Can you see them just screaming, but no attack.

1410
01:33:16,633 --> 01:33:18,118
There's a reason behind it.

1411
01:33:18,260 --> 01:33:21,630
Once you start playing, has increased the demand for votes

1412
01:33:21,918 --> 01:33:24,751
Price ballot have increased, from 5,000 to 9,000.

1413
01:33:24,751 --> 01:33:27,594
You have to survive if they want to be paid!

1414
01:33:28,884 --> 01:33:31,751
Please calm all.

1415
01:33:31,751 --> 01:33:33,997

1419
01:33:40,769 --> 01:33:42,651
It's a fun program.

1420
01:33:42,816 --> 01:33:45,214
We did not bring him to raise the issue.

1421
01:33:45,558 --> 01:33:47,315
Now, you will be playing with him.

1422
01:33:47,340 --> 01:33:48,969
Permainkanlah he participated like you!

1423
01:33:52,366 --> 01:33:54,622
You still raw in politics, right?

1424
01:33:54,850 --> 01:33:57,084
This must be the beginning of their ideas.

1425
01:33:57,779 --> 01:33:58,475
Mr ..

1426
01:33:58,500 --> 01:34:00,516
You know not the price of one kilogram of tomatoes?

1427
01:34:02,061 --> 01:34:04,350
What is the price of one kilogram of salt?

1428
01:34:04,419 --> 01:34:06,076
Have you eaten rice and salt?

1429
01:34:16,478 --> 01:34:19,554
Looks like you're all in kid mode play.

1430
01:34:21,516 --> 01:34:25,819
To be honest I do not know the price of one kilogram of tomatoes.

1431
01:34:25,819 --> 01:34:27,868
But you know where such a kind of tomato?

1432
01:34:29,625 --> 01:34:31,750
Hey, show him the tomatoes!

1433
01:34:32,031 --> 01:34:34,257
Sir, this is the tomato.

1434
01:34:37,680 --> 01:34:39,398
Mindless!

1435
01:34:46,391 --> 01:34:50,721
I want to tell you an interesting story about the crime that these tomatoes?

1436
01:34:51,804 --> 01:34:54,348
In seven countries across the world ..

1437
01:34:54,657 --> 01:34:57,266
..sos made of tomato us ..

1438
01:34:57,415 --> 01:34:59,858
..dinikmati with full of fun.

1439
01:35:00,430 --> 01:35:04,374
Tomato growing on our land, have tremendous demand worldwide.

1440
01:35:04,398 --> 01:35:06,153
But there is one big mystery.

1441
01:35:06,758 --> 01:35:11,656
People who grow tomatoes, always just die here.

1442
01:35:12,821 --> 01:35:14,348
You know why?

1443
01:35:15,133 --> 01:35:17,366
The amount of tomatoes that are grown here ..

1444
01:35:17,774 --> 01:35:22,704
..suku of the total left to rot ..

1445
01:35:22,868 --> 01:35:24,511
..and will be discarded in the trash.

1446
01:35:24,511 --> 01:35:28,767
Suppose they both have 55kg of tomatoes per person.

1447
01:35:29,024 --> 01:35:30,672
Although there is high demand,

1448
01:35:30,813 --> 01:35:33,517
..I will only buy tomatoes with one of them.

1449
01:35:33,617 --> 01:35:35,965
I will not buy tomatoes from another man ..

1450
01:35:35,965 --> 01:35:38,596
..walau else I need it.

1451
01:35:38,790 --> 01:35:40,839
The life expectancy of tomatoes it?

1452
01:35:41,290 --> 01:35:43,172
Only two days.

1453
01:35:43,196 --> 01:35:48,829
I do not know who will be damaged tomato ago, both the seller will always feel afraid.

1454
01:35:49,635 --> 01:35:54,186
Now, prices are based on prices offered by manufacturers sauce.

1455
01:35:54,772 --> 01:35:57,916
He would buy tomatoes worth 40 rupees only 6 rupees.

1456
01:35:58,063 --> 01:36:00,539
It was he bought with a salesperson alone.

1457
01:36:00,563 --> 01:36:02,866
Tomatoes are available on another vendor ..

1458
01:36:02,866 --> 01:36:05,787
..akan damaged and will eventually be thrown in the trash.

1459
01:36:08,183 --> 01:36:13,125
Foreign families in other countries in the world enjoy a meal with tomato sauce ..

1460
01:36:14,172 --> 01:36:16,274
..manakala our farm families here ..

1461
01:36:17,192 --> 01:36:18,804
..bunuh themselves and die.

1462
01:36:23,336 --> 01:36:27,856
So, next time if we want to throw a tomato ..

1463
01:36:28,508 --> 01:36:32,929
..we think farmers who grow these plants.

1464
01:36:37,312 --> 01:36:38,640
Why is this?

1465
01:36:39,403 --> 01:36:41,086
Why silent all the time?

1466
01:36:41,375 --> 01:36:43,234
If you messing with me, go ahead.

1467
01:36:43,274 --> 01:36:45,772
- Sir, I have questions. - Ask.

1468
01:36:45,772 --> 01:36:47,852
During the elections, sometimes we voted for an excitement only.

1469
01:36:47,877 --> 01:36:49,758
There are times when we will be able to vote for a fee.

1470
01:36:49,783 --> 01:36:53,417
But why would you want to bother just because of one vote?

1471
01:36:53,417 --> 01:36:56,198
You already know that section 49-P that exists.

1472
01:36:56,223 --> 01:36:57,518
You topple the government.

1473
01:36:57,543 --> 01:37:00,244
You resign. Why do all this?

1474
01:37:02,633 --> 01:37:04,440
I want to tell the real reason?

1475
01:37:04,440 --> 01:37:06,555
Come on! Come on!

1476
01:37:08,719 --> 01:37:10,684
My hometown is Rameswaram.

1477
01:37:11,343 --> 01:37:16,085
Try living among poverty in the land and sea forces as well.

1478
01:37:16,085 --> 01:37:18,372
..keluarga we were among the hundreds of fishing families.

1479
01:37:18,634 --> 01:37:21,246
There is no guarantee to return alive after going fishing.

1480
01:37:21,627 --> 01:37:26,057
Families of those who died at sea will be abandoned.

1481
01:37:26,057 --> 01:37:27,933
Hunger affects all families.

1482
01:37:28,948 --> 01:37:30,957
Then, there is an election.

1483
01:37:31,353 --> 01:37:34,185
We do not believe all the candidates.

1484
01:37:34,712 --> 01:37:36,455
Without a vote, they go to sea.

1485
01:37:36,471 --> 01:37:38,015
My uncle went with them.

1486
01:37:38,015 --> 01:37:40,080
Elections took place when they were at sea.

1487
01:37:41,143 --> 01:37:44,459
The politician who has been in power for 5 years.

1488
01:37:45,205 --> 01:37:46,982
But, the people?

1489
01:37:47,861 --> 01:37:50,229
They only powerful one day.

1490
01:37:51,315 --> 01:37:54,537
Realizing their mistake go into the sea at that time ..

1491
01:37:55,268 --> 01:37:57,369
..they tried to return.

1492
01:37:57,909 --> 01:37:59,174
And at that moment ..

1493
01:38:00,948 --> 01:38:06,026
..tentera neighbors and fishermen who shot my father was innocent.

1494
01:38:09,377 --> 01:38:11,355
In that attack, my father ..

1495
01:38:17,179 --> 01:38:19,269
Together with my father ..

1496
01:38:19,782 --> 01:38:21,546
13 people ..

1497
01:38:22,180 --> 01:38:23,551
..terkorban.

1498
01:38:25,235 --> 01:38:29,949
Those who survived the attack, trying to bring the wounded to the beach ..

1499
01:38:31,118 --> 01:38:33,599
..but my father who was shot to say ..

1500
01:38:34,485 --> 01:38:36,663
.. "Do not take me back to the land"

1501
01:38:37,132 --> 01:38:41,586
"Preparing for the funeral will cost 2000 rupees"

1502
01:38:41,961 --> 01:38:45,210
"My kids can eat for 2 years with my money .."

1503
01:38:45,876 --> 01:38:46,977
"Jadi.."

1504
01:38:47,344 --> 01:38:49,507
"Bring my body .."

1505
01:38:51,016 --> 01:38:53,691
"And throw it in the ocean," he cried.

1506
01:38:55,460 --> 01:38:57,221
When he breathed his last breath ..

1507
01:38:58,047 --> 01:38:59,397
..they measles body.

1508
01:39:00,079 --> 01:39:01,539
To the ocean.

1509
01:39:04,141 --> 01:39:08,040
Always heard, the measles remains in the sea ..

1510
01:39:08,907 --> 01:39:11,155
But this time my father was thrown.

1511
01:39:12,586 --> 01:39:15,480
And the person who wins the elections did not do anything!

1512
01:39:16,360 --> 01:39:19,171
Fishermen's associations to fund learning my mother.

1513
01:39:19,171 --> 01:39:22,093
My mother studied and became a school teacher. And he forced us to learn!

1514
01:39:22,211 --> 01:39:24,898
I learned of a crazy kid. More intensely than ever.

1515
01:39:26,334 --> 01:39:29,216
I attended every interview is coming!

1516
01:39:29,216 --> 01:39:32,446
No matter the city and country where I was, I always go back.

1517
01:39:32,951 --> 01:39:34,515
For elections.

1518
01:39:38,414 --> 01:39:40,267
Some people asked me was not it?

1519
01:39:42,335 --> 01:39:44,137
Have you eaten rice and salt?

1520
01:39:44,162 --> 01:39:45,804
You know! I'm fishing!

1521
01:39:47,208 --> 01:39:49,695
Salt is in the air that I breathe.

1522
01:39:53,828 --> 01:39:54,943
Sorry.

1523
01:39:57,071 --> 01:39:58,406
In this meeting ..

1524
01:39:59,062 --> 01:40:01,181
None of you are not from Chennai ...

1525
01:40:01,892 --> 01:40:04,517
How many of you have come from outside? Raise your hand.

1526
01:40:14,765 --> 01:40:17,361
How many people who want to return home?

1527
01:40:23,054 --> 01:40:24,236
Why do not you go home?

1528
01:40:24,236 --> 01:40:27,116
They all came here to escape from hunger there!

1529
01:40:27,141 --> 01:40:29,030
You of Rameswaram. I'm from Pudhukottai.

1530
01:40:29,055 --> 01:40:32,640
I really wanted to go back. But people come here because of the hydrocarbons.

1531
01:40:32,718 --> 01:40:34,219
How can I go back?

1532
01:40:34,219 --> 01:40:36,171
I'm from Tirunelveli. Problems usurer!

1533
01:40:36,187 --> 01:40:38,187
I'm from Chengalpet. Problems wages!

1534
01:40:38,202 --> 01:40:39,850
I am from Thanjavur! Methane problem.

1535
01:40:39,875 --> 01:40:41,875
I'm from Kanchipuram! Thieves sand.

1536
01:40:41,898 --> 01:40:43,703
I can not take water from the river Cauvery.

1537
01:40:43,805 --> 01:40:45,584
Krishna river inaccessible.

1538
01:40:45,609 --> 01:40:48,151
Mullaiperiyar Dam did not help!

1539
01:40:48,151 --> 01:40:50,221
With all these problems, how can I get him back?

1540
01:40:52,882 --> 01:40:56,181
32 issues in all 32 two regions!

1541
01:40:57,367 --> 01:41:00,247
We live as fugitives in our own hometown.

1542
01:41:00,773 --> 01:41:05,301
If we remain silent, they would not let us naked.

1543
01:41:05,882 --> 01:41:08,450
One day, they have to answer all of these!

1544
01:41:09,406 --> 01:41:11,818
What do you say? Could you please repeat?

1545
01:41:11,818 --> 01:41:13,761
One day, they have to answer all of these!

1546
01:41:13,761 --> 01:41:15,232
When you ask them questions?

1547
01:41:16,596 --> 01:41:18,756
Without asking, how are you going to answer?

1548
01:41:21,178 --> 01:41:24,526
Write every problem they call on paper.

1549
01:41:25,390 --> 01:41:27,390
I would ask that question!

1550
01:41:28,038 --> 01:41:29,780
The Chief Minister Masilamani!

1551
01:41:29,882 --> 01:41:33,315
I would ask those who have the power ..

1552
01:41:33,315 --> 01:41:35,958
..bila they will solve this problem, right now.

1553
01:41:36,433 --> 01:41:38,466
From here keep to it.

1554
01:41:38,647 --> 01:41:39,609
Lord, Lord!

1555
01:41:39,609 --> 01:41:40,828
We can not go there now, sir.

1556
01:41:40,828 --> 01:41:43,093
Mr. Masilamani were at the party.

1557
01:41:43,093 --> 01:41:45,176
Not saved if only go there now.

1558
01:41:46,303 --> 01:41:49,802
If I decided to ask, then I would do it immediately!

1559
01:41:50,918 --> 01:41:52,404
Then, we will follow you.

1560
01:41:52,404 --> 01:41:53,516
We will participate once.

1561
01:41:55,111 --> 01:41:57,548
We all will follow once!

1562
01:41:57,564 --> 01:41:59,619
We all will follow once!

1563
01:41:59,713 --> 01:42:01,962
We all will follow once!

1564
01:42:03,433 --> 01:42:05,433
Asking questions will cause problems.

1565
01:42:05,933 --> 01:42:09,129
And when asked directly, the problem will come with vengeance.

1566
01:42:09,451 --> 01:42:10,044
So..

1567
01:42:10,104 --> 01:42:12,424
We all will follow once!

1568
01:42:12,503 --> 01:42:13,595
We all will follow once!

1569
01:42:18,468 --> 01:42:19,340
Let's go.

1570
01:42:19,340 --> 01:42:21,675
Come on! Keep moving!

1571
01:42:23,007 --> 01:42:25,301
Come on! Keep moving!

1572
01:42:26,173 --> 01:42:29,013
Come on! Keep moving!

1573
01:42:39,853 --> 01:42:41,452
I top man! Very strange!

1574
01:42:41,452 --> 01:42:43,404
I am the brave. As I turn on the axis!

1575
01:42:43,404 --> 01:42:45,199
Cover them. Keep them back!

1576
01:42:45,199 --> 01:42:47,127
Risks exist in our raddar.

1577
01:42:47,127 --> 01:42:49,801
Who are you?

1578
01:42:50,201 --> 01:42:53,718
Submitting! Scream!

1579
01:42:53,785 --> 01:42:57,377
Submitting! Scream!

1580
01:42:57,900 --> 01:43:00,579
Hey, you!

1581
01:43:22,259 --> 01:43:24,922
How many elections made so far?

1582
01:43:24,922 --> 01:43:26,327
How many elections?

1583
01:43:26,982 --> 01:43:27,670
Chairman.

1584
01:43:27,670 --> 01:43:30,142
Sundar way here to see you.

1585
01:43:30,142 --> 01:43:31,056
He wants to come here?

1586
01:43:33,004 --> 01:43:34,037
Really dumb.

1587
01:43:34,037 --> 01:43:36,227
He came riding a motorcycle.

1588
01:43:36,251 --> 01:43:38,211
I'm a top man! Coming soon strike back!

1589
01:43:38,211 --> 01:43:39,976
Fikrilah twice before attacking!

1590
01:43:39,976 --> 01:43:41,831
Get out! Let it get some air!

1591
01:43:41,831 --> 01:43:45,117
One shot will make you apart from me! Do it!

1592
01:43:45,141 --> 01:43:48,815
Do not you dare turn merenungku and strength!

1593
01:43:48,839 --> 01:43:52,328
When someone opposes, it's just a sign of progress!

1594
01:43:52,352 --> 01:43:54,352
I lealki top. I'll turn on the axis!

1595
01:44:11,036 --> 01:44:13,160
Planting a tree would cause rain, they say!

1596
01:44:13,185 --> 01:44:14,934
Fraud is this?

1597
01:44:15,551 --> 01:44:17,667
Is Ocean lined with trees?

1598
01:44:17,988 --> 01:44:19,581
Rain did not go down there!

1599
01:44:21,739 --> 01:44:24,356
When I told them my word stupid.

1600
01:44:36,559 --> 01:44:39,385
Why not print money 5,000 or 10,000 or 20,000?

1601
01:44:39,385 --> 01:44:41,337
You do not know whether it is productivity?

1602
01:44:41,337 --> 01:44:44,147
Is this not the party leader and pioneer in productivity?

1603
01:45:26,086 --> 01:45:27,086
What is this?

1604
01:45:27,111 --> 01:45:29,111
I want to join a political party?

1605
01:45:29,235 --> 01:45:31,429
Or did you come to know you're gonna want to go back there?

1606
01:45:31,531 --> 01:45:32,695
I have not come for that reason.

1607
01:45:32,719 --> 01:45:34,218
I came to ask questions.

1608
01:45:34,243 --> 01:45:36,149
You dare me up on the stage ..

1609
01:45:36,227 --> 01:45:38,570
..and asked me the question huh?

1610
01:45:39,172 --> 01:45:40,685
Can you see how many are there?

1611
01:45:41,969 --> 01:45:43,714
If I say a word ..

1612
01:45:44,039 --> 01:45:45,481
There was no need to say anything.

1613
01:45:46,156 --> 01:45:49,034
If I give the signal ..

1614
01:45:49,531 --> 01:45:52,606
..di here, they will pull your limbs one by one!

1615
01:46:05,517 --> 01:46:09,219
This is a major issue 32 of 32 regions.

1616
01:46:09,916 --> 01:46:12,521
People in poor condition and difficult.

1617
01:46:13,275 --> 01:46:15,681
If you made the announcement at the microphone and promised ..

1618
01:46:16,002 --> 01:46:18,145
..yang you'll finish after the elections.

1619
01:46:18,830 --> 01:46:20,830
I will withdraw from the contest.

1620
01:46:21,947 --> 01:46:22,947
Easy.

1621
01:46:24,252 --> 01:46:27,522
If you're scared, admitted alone and get out of here.

1622
01:46:28,182 --> 01:46:31,279
Rather than write a letter mcam school boy.

1623
01:46:33,275 --> 01:46:34,806
I read tamil.

1624
01:46:34,916 --> 01:46:36,695
Luckily I learned.

1625
01:46:44,326 --> 01:46:45,607
What is it all about?

1626
01:46:45,725 --> 01:46:49,189
What we back up every time elections for 30 years ..

1627
01:46:49,294 --> 01:46:51,856
wrote damning piece of paper in half this?

1628
01:46:52,091 --> 01:46:55,267
If we make this right, no more poverty!

1629
01:46:55,575 --> 01:46:59,564
If there is no poverty, people will receive money for mengundikah?

1630
01:47:00,209 --> 01:47:02,241
They have to steal for food!

1631
01:47:02,396 --> 01:47:04,396
They must suffer stomach ..

1632
01:47:04,443 --> 01:47:07,079
..and their ears will hear a famine.

1633
01:47:07,258 --> 01:47:11,070
Then, by 5000 that we give ..

1634
01:47:11,381 --> 01:47:13,755
..they will come like a dog for our vote.

1635
01:47:13,755 --> 01:47:16,599
How are you going to understand all this? Take it!

1636
01:47:21,575 --> 01:47:22,640
Not.

1637
01:47:23,732 --> 01:47:25,482
You've misunderstood.

1638
01:47:26,334 --> 01:47:29,328
They can withstand hunger and poverty only temporarily.

1639
01:47:29,498 --> 01:47:32,224
In addition, if you touch their dignity ..

1640
01:47:33,193 --> 01:47:34,592
You remember?

1641
01:47:35,225 --> 01:47:37,459
"Jallikattu" (Events tame cattle)

1642
01:47:42,076 --> 01:47:43,357
Sister ..

1643
01:47:43,725 --> 01:47:46,060
In Tamil Nadu there are only two major political parties ..

1644
01:47:46,506 --> 01:47:47,941
One of them is me.

1645
01:47:48,131 --> 01:47:51,395
And another, who was on a microphone that.

1646
01:47:51,404 --> 01:47:54,728
Now he's come together in such a united party and my party.

1647
01:47:54,857 --> 01:47:56,867
Now I have full majority!

1648
01:47:57,490 --> 01:48:01,543
So, if people want to vote in anger once ..

1649
01:48:01,543 --> 01:48:04,052
..they will give 100 votes to soap symbol ..

1650
01:48:04,225 --> 01:48:07,617
..or 200 lots for brush symbol. That is all!

1651
01:48:08,350 --> 01:48:11,711
If the majority is more than ever before, so it can be resolved quickly!

1652
01:48:13,380 --> 01:48:15,162
You're crazy!

1653
01:48:15,318 --> 01:48:19,617
With the money I get from all this, I have to buy them!

1654
01:48:22,287 --> 01:48:24,794
234 ahli MLA ..

1655
01:48:24,794 --> 01:48:27,482
..and 36 ministers! The source of their income ..

1656
01:48:27,600 --> 01:48:29,478
..dari paper in your hand.

1657
01:48:29,748 --> 01:48:31,442
What you can accomplish ..

1658
01:48:31,442 --> 01:48:34,386
..With against me only in one area alone?

1659
01:48:34,717 --> 01:48:36,818
My party will rule shortly ..

1660
01:48:36,843 --> 01:48:38,984
..and the only dissenter.

1661
01:48:39,113 --> 01:48:40,537
Is not it somewhat unique?

1662
01:48:50,920 --> 01:48:52,202
Now I get it.

1663
01:48:53,045 --> 01:48:55,419
I get it that you are not the political machinery ..

1664
01:48:55,522 --> 01:48:58,823
..but just a small wheel at the enterprise.

1665
01:48:59,449 --> 01:49:03,719
Not so the wheel, but the entire machine needs to be replaced.

1666
01:49:04,920 --> 01:49:08,753
At first I just wanted to stop you in your own area.

1667
01:49:10,942 --> 01:49:12,167
I tell you now.

1668
01:49:13,693 --> 01:49:15,681
Not just in your area.

1669
01:49:16,420 --> 01:49:19,600
But in all 234 constituencies ..

1670
01:49:20,701 --> 01:49:22,609
..orang the people I will be contesting.

1671
01:49:23,662 --> 01:49:25,714
He talks a lot but does not know anything.

1672
01:49:28,047 --> 01:49:30,595
You dah too much duitkah?

1673
01:49:43,817 --> 01:49:46,692
You said I came to this rally like in a trap, right?

1674
01:49:47,129 --> 01:49:49,169
When you arrive, how many viewers?

1675
01:49:49,990 --> 01:49:52,259
Look at the number of spectators present.

1676
01:50:04,134 --> 01:50:05,204
You did not hear?

1677
01:50:05,846 --> 01:50:08,474
Can you hear the roar?

1678
01:50:09,228 --> 01:50:11,336
Beautiful! Beautiful! Beautiful!

1679
01:50:11,721 --> 01:50:13,982
Beautiful! Beautiful! Beautiful!

1680
01:50:14,384 --> 01:50:17,015
Beautiful! Beautiful! Beautiful!

1681
01:50:42,452 --> 01:50:45,046
They come just a day!

1682
01:50:45,692 --> 01:50:46,967
Mr. Rendu.

1683
01:50:48,023 --> 01:50:50,155
Now, a person can be a group ..

1684
01:50:50,163 --> 01:50:52,920
..and one can be a lot.

1685
01:50:53,179 --> 01:50:54,968
Only in a day.

1686
01:52:04,569 --> 01:52:05,680
Let them go.

1687
01:52:22,833 --> 01:52:24,754
Let them go!

1688
01:52:25,662 --> 01:52:26,999
Who is that?

1689
01:52:55,203 --> 01:52:58,054
I miss you because you're a woman. You would not survive if getting hit!

1690
01:52:58,680 --> 01:53:01,577
Do not talk to women who have delivered that he can not bear the pain!

1691
01:53:01,602 --> 01:53:03,061
Strike me! Pukulllah me!

1692
01:53:28,983 --> 01:53:30,381
Strike me. Pukulllah!

1693
01:53:30,397 --> 01:53:33,744
Strike the hand that receives money in exchange for votes. Strike.

1694
01:53:40,276 --> 01:53:42,976
Strike legs can run after the promised free goods.

1695
01:53:50,665 --> 01:53:53,474
Strike the oral question the atrocities you all!

1696
01:54:03,029 --> 01:54:05,153
Got sick? Pain is not it?

1697
01:54:05,271 --> 01:54:06,677
They were sick too.

1698
01:54:06,677 --> 01:54:09,265
It hurts just like them!

1699
01:55:46,308 --> 01:55:47,815
I am sorry.

1700
01:55:48,370 --> 01:55:50,183
All of this is my fault.

1701
01:55:50,323 --> 01:55:51,857
Do not Cry!

1702
01:55:51,857 --> 01:55:53,800
Just today we know, they'll be at if we ask.

1703
01:55:53,800 --> 01:55:55,155
This pain can not lose.

1704
01:55:55,155 --> 01:55:57,925
I can feel the spirit of Kumaran, a freedom fighter in this pain.

1705
01:55:58,901 --> 01:56:02,115
It's not what's up, brother. It will be well if I rub turmeric.

1706
01:56:02,115 --> 01:56:03,735
Can we go forward if we are afraid of the pain?

1707
01:56:03,830 --> 01:56:07,125
I know you said you got anything for my good.

1708
01:56:08,112 --> 01:56:10,214
I hear what these women say in the commotion earlier.

1709
01:56:10,932 --> 01:56:13,236
Do not talk to women who have delivered that he can not bear the pain!

1710
01:56:13,261 --> 01:56:14,501
That's what she said!

1711
01:56:14,707 --> 01:56:16,917
This pain is also the same as the maternity hospital kid!

1712
01:56:17,159 --> 01:56:18,886
Hold on!

1713
01:56:19,151 --> 01:56:20,613
Something new..

1714
01:56:21,284 --> 01:56:24,021
Tamil Nadu which will be born!

1715
01:56:24,206 --> 01:56:25,510
Will be born!

1716
01:56:28,190 --> 01:56:30,830
The topic of conversation in Tamil Nadu today ..

01:56:30,963 --> 01:56:33,856
..mengenai party rally former Chief Minister, Mr Masilamani ..

..malam was contaminated with riots.

1719
01:56:35,268 --> 01:56:36,939
He went to any of his own!

1720
01:56:36,939 --> 01:56:40,118
One by one. We can not follow him. Just look at him.

1721
01:56:40,118 --> 01:56:44,514
The riots that occurred in the party rallies former Chief Minister, Mr Masilamani ..

1722
01:56:44,514 --> 01:56:48,230
political ..pakar predict which political party AIMMK ..

01:56:48,347 --> 01:56:50,479
..not yet received support from the public.

1724
01:56:50,604 --> 01:56:52,190
They were beaten up like veal!

1725
01:56:52,245 --> 01:56:54,245
What action the Association of Human Rights?

1726
01:56:54,270 --> 01:56:55,885
They can not hit people like that.

1727
01:56:55,910 --> 01:56:57,455
I did not know he was good or bad,

1728
01:56:57,768 --> 01:56:59,838
..but it's something interesting to see.

1729
01:57:00,044 --> 01:57:02,102
A study was conducted by Loyola College ..

1730
01:57:02,102 --> 01:57:05,651
..and shows the support of 52% against Mr Sundar Ramaswamy.

1731
01:57:05,651 --> 01:57:08,525
Previously she has approval ratings of 4% ..

1732
01:57:08,525 --> 01:57:11,889
..ke the study held yesterday.

1733
01:57:16,608 --> 01:57:19,889
I said that people I will contest in 234 constituencies!

1734
01:57:20,015 --> 01:57:21,695
Bye elections soon.

1735
01:57:21,695 --> 01:57:23,719
People saw what happened last night on TV ..

1736
01:57:23,741 --> 01:57:25,905
..and read it in the newspapers.

1737
01:57:26,179 --> 01:57:29,501
They want to know what our next step.

1738
01:57:29,578 --> 01:57:30,722
Look over there.

1739
01:57:33,522 --> 01:57:35,303
There will be more news.

1740
01:57:35,686 --> 01:57:40,621
200 to 300 hundred people in each area come forward to help without being asked!

1741
01:57:44,772 --> 01:57:46,841
I'll tell you what we will do next.

1742
01:57:47,772 --> 01:57:49,826
First we need a place to work.

1743
01:57:50,522 --> 01:57:52,801
The place? This is the place!

1744
01:57:55,068 --> 01:57:57,668
But there are many families living here.

1745
01:57:57,701 --> 01:57:59,701
What you are! To the edge!

1746
01:57:59,726 --> 01:58:01,649
Give way.

1747
01:58:02,161 --> 01:58:03,388
All listen up!

1748
01:58:03,436 --> 01:58:06,764
Until the election is over, this is our office block!

1749
01:58:06,764 --> 01:58:08,789
These housing blocks.

1750
01:58:08,789 --> 01:58:11,098
We are all united under one roof.

1751
01:58:11,295 --> 01:58:12,811
We are all one family.

1752
01:58:12,811 --> 01:58:16,615
When we go out, we eat, and fight together, right?

1753
01:58:16,615 --> 01:58:20,181
Like it! Do you understand? - Yes!

1754
01:58:29,180 --> 01:58:30,653
Our enemy ??

1755
01:58:30,678 --> 01:58:32,173
Strong!

1756
01:58:33,077 --> 01:58:34,794
Yesterday we ..

1757
01:58:34,794 --> 01:58:37,086
Naive and gullible!

1758
01:58:39,089 --> 01:58:40,417
Today we ..

1759
01:58:40,442 --> 01:58:42,463
Hero..!

1760
01:58:43,999 --> 01:58:47,181
As of yesterday ..

1761
01:58:47,181 --> 01:58:50,208
We are naive and gullible!

1762
01:58:50,208 --> 01:58:53,227
As of yesterday ..

1763
01:58:53,227 --> 01:58:56,286
We are naive and gullible!

1764
01:58:56,286 --> 01:58:59,400
Starting today..

1765
01:58:59,400 --> 01:59:02,378
We woke up as heroes, though not perfect.

1766
01:59:02,378 --> 01:59:05,309
Hero, hero!

1767
01:59:05,309 --> 01:59:08,596

02:12:58,275 --> 02:13:02,924
Mr. Sundar Ramaswamy suspected planner of this heinous act.

1947
02:13:04,451 --> 02:13:05,677
What is all this?

1948
02:13:05,827 --> 02:13:08,591
Dad did not understand anything when you hear the crash!

1949
02:13:08,802 --> 02:13:12,630
Feel father alive again when you do not hear anything.

1950
02:13:12,849 --> 02:13:16,583
He's planning something big! People are angry with us!

1951
02:13:16,740 --> 02:13:19,185
It's okay if people mad at him.

1952
02:13:19,208 --> 02:13:21,935
But he is no important evidence with him.

1953
02:13:21,960 --> 02:13:25,754
He's hard disk Muthukumar of Sattai.com.

If he reveal?

1955
02:13:27,115 --> 02:13:30,990
Before he cheats more people, we have to expose the hard drive.

1956
02:13:30,990 --> 02:13:34,009
Nobody can talk about the evidence available to it.

1957
02:13:34,279 --> 02:13:38,056
Every road, valleys, places and corners in Tamil Nadu only going to talk about my father.

1958
02:13:38,056 --> 02:13:38,776

Not only the chief minister in neighboring states ..

02:13:48,177 --> 02:13:50,939
But the prime minister must be on the fence of our house.

1963
02:13:50,939 --> 02:13:51,970
All right.

02:13:53,599 --> 02:13:55,752

02:14:03,717 --> 02:14:07,336
Although we were not here, we have to continue the party in power, father.

Roads, bridges, stadiums and universities will be named after us!

We will be all this what if we were imprisoned?

1972
02:14:16,850 --> 02:14:21,226
What we need now is a full victory in the elections.

1973
02:14:31,440 --> 02:14:33,752
You remember, dad'm losing party.

1974
02:14:34,161 --> 02:14:36,609
More than that, we've got our own regime.

Rendu know everything.

1976

I do not know if we can give evidence that we have.

He's sure the evidence is already meaningless.

1993

People have started mad at us.

1994

If we suspected person is gone, people will increasingly hate him.

1995

Okay.

It will enhance my victory.

2019
02:18:22,563 --> 02:18:25,572
Leaders who suddenly appear like you can never exist again.

2020
02:18:25,680 --> 02:18:28,714
You retreat from here, it will be an example to them.

2021
02:18:28,714 --> 02:18:30,934
I got accustomed to retreat.

2022

Breaking news!

I was writing a tweet using the Muthukumar.

2065
02:21:29,413 --> 02:21:30,155
Sir!

2066
02:21:31,504 --> 02:21:32,529
What?

2067
02:21:32,840 --> 02:21:35,447
You wrote a tweet against yourselves?

2068
02:21:35,793 --> 02:21:38,730
Sundar, 2% of the vote it was not necessarily that we can.

2069
02:21:38,755 --> 02:21:39,948
Why do this?

2070

All of you..

02:21:42,285 --> 02:21:44,525
We have six hours left before we disbanded.

2072
02:21:45,607 --> 02:21:48,848

Follow only what I tell them.

2074

Okay?

2076
02:21:58,135 --> 02:21:59,754
This all works Sundar.

2077
02:21:59,754 --> 02:22:02,484
He said he had evidence against him?

2078
02:22:03,534 --> 02:22:07,883
He raises a good name you praise your integrity.

2079
02:22:09,260 --> 02:22:11,832
Why did he use the tweet on behalf of others?

2080
02:22:13,979 --> 02:22:16,739
Mrs. did not want to reclaim the evidence called by the father madam ..

2081
02:22:16,739 --> 02:22:19,416
..and madam did not want to disclose it ..

02:22:20,705 --> 02:22:22,801
How madam can act so mature?

2084
02:22:22,801 --> 02:22:24,861
Any information disclosed during the election ..

2085
02:22:24,979 --> 02:22:26,846
is done with violating election laws.

2086
02:22:26,877 --> 02:22:30,125
That's why I asked for it to be disclosed tomorrow, when it all ended.

2087
02:22:30,125 --> 02:22:31,375

Muthukumar of Sattai.com'm out another tweet.

2092
02:22:41,094 --> 02:22:43,674
He told the location of the container containing the money ..

2093
02:22:43,699 --> 02:22:45,898
Sundar ..yang multinational companies take from that.

2094
02:22:45,898 --> 02:22:47,157
Containers containing money?

2095
02:22:47,354 --> 02:22:48,970
That's our money.

2096
02:22:49,222 --> 02:22:51,251
Why did he say that money is he?

2097
02:23:12,034 --> 02:23:14,717
The case was filed against Sundar under three sections.

2098
02:23:14,717 --> 02:23:17,057
He expected to be arrested today.

2099
02:23:17,057 --> 02:23:19,809
And piihanraya was walking, he would lose his deposit money.

2100
02:23:20,885 --> 02:23:23,973
Drop Sundar!

2101
02:23:25,176 --> 02:23:27,049
Elections are taking place ..

2102
02:23:27,074 --> 02:23:30,843
..and evidence against Sundar is very worrying.

2103
02:23:31,197 --> 02:23:35,080
Now the time of elections and the focus of the public must be disrupted.

2104
02:23:35,080 --> 02:23:37,543
And it is in violation of electoral rules.

2105
02:23:38,213 --> 02:23:39,671
Mr. Muthukumar ..

2106
02:23:39,671 --> 02:23:41,076

2109
02:23:57,681 --> 02:23:58,531
Mr ..

2110
02:23:58,531 --> 02:24:00,424
It does not matter if we lose in pililhanraya this time.

2111
02:24:00,424 --> 02:24:02,052
Please stop "tweet".

2112
02:24:02,088 --> 02:24:03,689

2114
02:24:06,111 --> 02:24:08,642
Why did not you tell me before? I just post one tweet!

2115
02:24:16,997 --> 02:24:20,291
He said there are containers money! But there are only a corpse alone!

2116
02:24:24,785 --> 02:24:25,785
Sir!

2117
02:24:25,826 --> 02:24:27,298
It remains Muthukumar, sir!

2118
02:24:27,298 --> 02:24:29,990
Muthukumar of Sattai.com? It seems that there have long been dead.

2119
02:24:30,352 --> 02:24:32,402
So Muthukumar dead?

2120
02:24:32,950 --> 02:24:35,285
She says she met Muthukumar morning.

2121
02:24:35,631 --> 02:24:40,349
He passes on the news that Muthukumar submit evidence this morning!

2122
02:24:47,122 --> 02:24:49,746
She said she met people who had 10 days off this morning.

2123
02:24:49,746 --> 02:24:51,645
This morning when I met you ..

2124
02:24:51,699 --> 02:24:53,509
This morning when I met you ..

2125
02:24:53,660 --> 02:24:55,350
This morning when I met you ..

2126
02:24:55,549 --> 02:24:57,795
But it seems she has also died more than 15 days ..

2127
02:24:57,820 --> 02:24:59,849
..macam where they can see you this morning?

2128
02:24:59,865 --> 02:25:05,040
Attempts to contact Komalavalli on this point, failed.

2129
02:25:05,040 --> 02:25:06,344
Dah 2pm.

2130
02:25:06,561 --> 02:25:08,191
How much done?

2131
02:25:08,191 --> 02:25:10,369
45%'m done.

2132
02:25:10,647 --> 02:25:13,535
The maximum, the turnout was 60%.

2133
02:25:14,603 --> 02:25:16,343
Do not worry.

2134
02:25:16,606 --> 02:25:18,423
Whatever he's trying to do, we'll still win.

2135
02:25:18,587 --> 02:25:20,704
Some of you may suspect ..

2136
02:25:21,766 --> 02:25:24,292
..yang Sundar is the mastermind behind all this.

2137
02:25:25,126 --> 02:25:26,192
Ya.

2138
02:25:26,525 --> 02:25:27,679
Indeed I am.

2139
02:25:27,860 --> 02:25:29,774
From the first tweet I made ..

2140
02:25:29,774 --> 02:25:33,279
..atas name of the man who's dead 15 days ago ..

2141
02:25:33,485 --> 02:25:35,735
..perempuan know that it is me.

2142
02:25:35,806 --> 02:25:36,998
But..

2143
02:25:37,493 --> 02:25:39,897
He did not know what my next plan ..

2144
02:25:39,897 --> 02:25:42,408
..and he knew the dead come back to life ..

2145
02:25:43,459 --> 02:25:45,048
..he's lying.

2146
02:25:46,095 --> 02:25:47,253
Not only that.

2147
02:25:47,556 --> 02:25:50,908
The cause of death of former Chief Minister, Mr Masilamani ..

2148
02:25:51,228 --> 02:25:53,985
..akan disclosed soon by her close relatives ..

2149
02:25:54,555 --> 02:25:56,544
..directly.

2150
02:25:56,823 --> 02:25:58,108
That person..

2151
02:26:00,821 --> 02:26:03,185
Masilamani is done with his wife.

2152
02:26:04,009 --> 02:26:06,464
His own mother!

2153
02:26:09,689 --> 02:26:12,741
If there are people who still have not voted, please wait.

2154
02:26:13,548 --> 02:26:17,355
He will give this a reality 2.30. Vote after the hearing.

2155
02:26:17,896 --> 02:26:18,938
Mommy!

2156
02:26:20,256 --> 02:26:21,081
Mommy!

2157
02:26:22,665 --> 02:26:23,872
Mommy!

2158
02:26:26,629 --> 02:26:27,713
Mommy!

2159
02:26:27,713 --> 02:26:28,833
Why?

2160
02:26:28,844 --> 02:26:30,179
Mommy's gone.

2161
02:26:31,399 --> 02:26:32,771
Mom could not speak, uncle.

2162
02:26:32,948 --> 02:26:34,879
We only have 4 hours again.

2163
02:26:35,136 --> 02:26:36,436
If the mother did not give a statement ..

2164
02:26:36,436 --> 02:26:38,612
..I will return what has already fallen.

2165
02:26:39,224 --> 02:26:40,416
Mak!

2166
02:26:42,751 --> 02:26:43,878
My mom go?

2167
02:26:43,878 --> 02:26:46,366
He said he wanted to grave sir.

2168
02:27:29,635 --> 02:27:31,312
It seems that you're up early here!

2169
02:27:31,312 --> 02:27:33,124
Reporters on the way.

2170
02:27:33,296 --> 02:27:34,858
We have 10 minutes left.

2171
02:27:36,163 --> 02:27:38,321
Have not you read the newspapers anymore?

2172
02:27:46,694 --> 02:27:49,130
Not guess how long you wait, the reporter will not come.

2173
02:27:49,669 --> 02:27:52,717
Once the election is over, the news will come.

2174
02:27:53,160 --> 02:27:55,036
I know the headlines?

2175
02:28:13,147 --> 02:28:14,483
Nothing. You do not okey?

2176
02:29:07,688 --> 02:29:09,013
Instant yes, ma'am!

2177
02:29:28,759 --> 02:29:32,055
I do not want to fight in the mood now!

2178
02:29:32,412 --> 02:29:35,925
I rarely get angry often. But this time I was really annoyed.

2179
02:29:35,968 --> 02:29:37,859
I'm not going to stop at.

2180
02:29:38,138 --> 02:29:40,573
I'll hit you to death!

2181
02:30:51,183 --> 02:30:52,147
They!

2182
02:30:53,058 --> 02:30:54,701

2183
02:30:54,996 --> 02:30:55,957
Point!

2184
02:30:56,534 --> 02:31:01,021
Tell the media what did you say to me, madam. Please help!

2185
02:31:01,714 --> 02:31:03,442
- Nila, are you ready? - Yes, ready.

2186
02:31:03,559 --> 02:31:05,686
Now, tell me your name. Talk.

2187
02:31:07,408 --> 02:31:11,541
My husband, Masilamani not die because normal pain.

2188
02:31:11,941 --> 02:31:15,266
He was killed by our daughter, Komalavalli.

2189
02:31:17,448 --> 02:31:22,288
I saw my son give a higher drug dose than usual.

2190
02:31:22,288 --> 02:31:23,612
I did not try to stop him.

2191
02:31:23,612 --> 02:31:25,612
For my husband is not a good man.

2192
02:31:25,814 --> 02:31:28,998
I told them all about the murder of Sattai Muthukumar.

2193
02:31:29,810 --> 02:31:31,961
If you let my son rule ..

2194
02:31:32,393 --> 02:31:34,984
..dia will be sold throughout the country.

2195
02:31:38,727 --> 02:31:41,074
Instant. Instant ..

2196
02:31:43,498 --> 02:31:46,076
Facebook will be broadcast live on all channels.

2197
02:31:46,274 --> 02:31:48,576
I know everyone is watching.

2198
02:31:48,984 --> 02:31:51,821
So far, 53% have voted.

2199
02:31:52,179 --> 02:31:55,685
Usually, the number of voters is 80% maximum.

2200
02:31:56,602 --> 02:31:59,958
If we nak save yourself from the situation today ..

2201
02:32:01,789 --> 02:32:05,171
..Everyone must vote!

2202
02:32:06,743 --> 02:32:08,144
That's all our expectations!

2203
02:32:09,587 --> 02:32:11,097
These young children.

2204
02:32:11,280 --> 02:32:12,998
What do they expect?

2205
02:32:13,407 --> 02:32:15,328
Not only journalists Muthukumar!

2206
02:32:15,858 --> 02:32:18,956
So far they've killed 18 people ..!

2207
02:32:19,469 --> 02:32:21,320
Who questioned their crimes!

2208
02:32:21,915 --> 02:32:24,133
All of them kind of young people who are here.

2209
02:32:24,382 --> 02:32:28,433
Aside from hoping to bring happiness in the lives of others ..

2210
02:32:28,926 --> 02:32:30,773
What mistake did they do?

2211
02:32:31,375 --> 02:32:34,547
From where they can be nerve to kill people like that?

2212
02:32:35,477 --> 02:32:37,109
They do not consider us human!

2213
02:32:37,134 --> 02:32:39,477
But only the votes they have paid for!

2214
02:32:39,922 --> 02:32:42,359
The money that we receive and that we make the vote ..

2215
02:32:42,399 --> 02:32:43,939
.. I made them so arrogant!

2216
02:32:45,524 --> 02:32:50,349
In a country of this size, only 45% - 50% of the vote.

2217
02:32:50,469 --> 02:32:53,336
10% is paid voters! 5% is illegal vote!

2218
02:32:53,391 --> 02:32:55,727
5% is to exchange gifts!

2219
02:32:57,657 --> 02:33:01,516
Only 20% of 100%, which determine who will govern.

2220
02:33:01,596 --> 02:33:03,036
Is this democracy?

2221
02:33:07,277 --> 02:33:09,836
At the very least, people can do for his country ..

2222
02:33:10,422 --> 02:33:12,047
is done with the vote!

2223
02:33:12,047 --> 02:33:14,004
Only 3 hours again.

2224
02:33:14,397 --> 02:33:16,234
This is not a job for the lazy ..

2225
02:33:16,259 --> 02:33:18,520
..or was just sitting at home not doing anything ..

2226
02:33:18,545 --> 02:33:21,813
Although you have an important job, suspend and ..

2227
02:33:21,915 --> 02:33:23,258
..pergilah vote!

2228
02:33:24,985 --> 02:33:27,938
If you're not willing to queue for 30 minutes to chop your fingers ..

2229
02:33:27,963 --> 02:33:31,182
..for the country voted for you ..

2230
02:33:32,126 --> 02:33:34,179
... you are simply thieves at the top of the list!

2231
02:33:34,563 --> 02:33:36,902
You are criminals at the top of the list!

2232
02:33:38,352 --> 02:33:39,763
Only 3 hours away!

2233
02:33:40,547 --> 02:33:42,000
If you let it pass ..

2234
02:33:42,492 --> 02:33:44,924
..situasi will continue for another 20 years!

2235
02:33:45,671 --> 02:33:47,916
The state will retreat for 50 years!

2236
02:33:53,499 --> 02:33:55,592
Take your voter ID!

2237
02:34:06,469 --> 02:34:10,867
This is the revolution of the vote!

2238
02:34:12,730 --> 02:34:17,279
Can you sense his emotions?

2239
02:34:21,876 --> 02:34:26,266
This is the revolution of the vote!

2240
02:34:26,767 --> 02:34:28,369
You all remember not?

2241
02:34:28,393 --> 02:34:29,877
It all started with one vote!

2242
02:34:29,901 --> 02:34:31,901


2243
02:34:49,535 --> 02:34:51,984
To eliminate poverty ..

2244
02:34:51,984 --> 02:34:54,741
To strive.

2245
02:34:55,300 --> 02:35:01,004
Do away with poverty is the only strategy you?

2246
02:35:01,028 --> 02:35:03,028


2247
02:35:18,299 --> 02:35:21,580
In the case of the assassination of former chief minister, Masilamani ..

2248
02:35:21,580 --> 02:35:23,875
..ketua AIMMK, Komalavalli ..

2249
02:35:23,875 --> 02:35:26,195
..and Rendu Malarvannan have already apprehended.

2250
02:35:28,363 --> 02:35:30,363
210 members of the Legislature!

2251
02:35:30,832 --> 02:35:33,142
Without the support of the party you are running as independents ..

2252
02:35:33,142 --> 02:35:34,824
..and win as a team.

2253
02:35:34,956 --> 02:35:37,010
Who among you are chosen as chief minister?

2254
02:35:37,120 --> 02:35:38,902
210 ahli MLA ..

2255
02:35:39,066 --> 02:35:40,644
210 symbols.

2256
02:35:42,223 --> 02:35:43,927
It's a surprise.

2257
02:35:46,082 --> 02:35:47,701
Who is the Chief Minister?

2258
02:35:48,161 --> 02:35:49,651
That's the next question.

2259
02:35:52,056 --> 02:35:56,138
Once again, 209 people need at a glance. The most qualified will be selected.

2260
02:35:57,494 --> 02:35:59,846
I say 209 because ..

2261
02:36:01,307 --> 02:36:02,837
..I will not be a part of it.

2262
02:36:11,304 --> 02:36:15,272
The mind does not want any opposition is a threat to democracy.

2263
02:36:15,928 --> 02:36:17,962
I'll be on the other side.

2264
02:36:18,866 --> 02:36:20,462
Opposition!

2265
02:36:21,319 --> 02:36:23,362
As anyone who asks!

2266
02:36:24,616 --> 02:36:27,912
This decision was made after thinking about it. It is final.

2267
02:36:28,804 --> 02:36:33,374
Among you there are former employees of the District, Mr. Sarkunam, IAS.

2268
02:36:34,421 --> 02:36:38,194
I nominate him as Chief Minister.

2269
02:36:45,433 --> 02:36:47,758
We only have 14 days.

2270
02:36:48,216 --> 02:36:50,695
It all became a reality because of young children.

2271
02:36:51,519 --> 02:36:53,798
If you go to another country ..

2272
02:36:53,816 --> 02:36:58,209
..and asked who are willing to shed blood and soul of the community ..

2273
02:36:58,699 --> 02:37:02,923
They will appoint someone to live 30 or 40 years ago.

2274
02:37:02,923 --> 02:37:06,681
But, if we ask the same questions today in Tamil Nadu ..

2275
02:37:07,534 --> 02:37:10,494
The answer is, "Young people who shed their blood in this year"

2276
02:37:10,763 --> 02:37:13,754
Those who gave their lives last month.

2277
02:37:15,383 --> 02:37:16,981
Although it is an agonizing ..

2278
02:37:18,357 --> 02:37:19,794
..I feel very proud.
