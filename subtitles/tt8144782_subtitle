1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,833


3
00:03:19,792 --> 00:03:21,833
Are they going to resolve
 a public issue?

4
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:24,208
They aren't so good enough.

5
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:27,875
As usual, they would've created
some ruckus.

6
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:29,417
That's why, they're going around.

7
00:03:29,417 --> 00:03:31,458
You don't know about them, isn't it?

8
00:03:31,458 --> 00:03:33,750
One of them is Ashok
and the other one is Anand.

9
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,417
They both are close friends
 from childhood.

10
00:03:35,417 --> 00:03:38,875
Just because they're close,
don't think they will always be united.

11
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:41,125
They won't stay united
in any way.

12
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:44,625
But, there is a place where
both of them will be together.

13
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:45,625
Kabaddi!

14
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:59,333
One of the guy is defence player
 and the other one is an offence player.

15
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:00,958
Both the captains come here.

16
00:04:14,292 --> 00:04:18,250
Are they inherent
or intentionally doing this?

17
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:21,167
I don't know even though
 I'm with them all these years.

18
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,083
On eve of 'Karaikudi goddess
chariot festival'...

19
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:25,625
Choose one.

20
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:26,750
Your choice.

21
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:27,833
The toss.

22
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:30,125
It's tail!

23
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:33,875
The toss won by 'Super South Boys'.

24
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:39,125
In today's finale, 'Super South Boys team'
 and ' Rastha Royal Tigers team'...

25
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:40,208
Hey!

26
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:41,208
Ashok, we must rock.

27
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:42,667
Ashok, don't give up
as he is your friend.

28
00:04:42,667 --> 00:04:44,208
The dignity of our clan
is in your hands.

29
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:44,708
Yes.

30
00:04:44,708 --> 00:04:47,958
The film actor and poet, Mr.Pa.Vijay,

31
00:04:47,958 --> 00:04:54,333
The son of our soil, philanthropist,
respected Mr. Thennarasu...

32
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:57,042
Dude, this match is headed
 by your uncle.

33
00:04:57,042 --> 00:04:59,250
If we lose, it'll be a shame.
You must win.

34
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:00,583
Do you remember
the practice sessions?

35
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:02,958
It's the finale where both
the mountains collide each other.

36
00:05:02,958 --> 00:05:07,083
The captain of 'Rastha Royals Tiger team'
star of hope, Anand.

37
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:08,958
He is the state level offence player.

38
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:12,875
If he starts playing,
 the opponents will panic.

39
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:17,375
But, today the opponent is
 'Super South Boys' Captain Ashok.

40
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:19,292
The best defence player
 of Tamil Nadu.

41
00:05:19,292 --> 00:05:21,958
He'll take goals just like that.

42
00:05:21,958 --> 00:05:26,250
Anand has taken
 one point, on bonus.

43
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:28,125
He is playing well.
Who is he?

44
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:30,000
Anand, my sister's son.
-Okay!

45
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,125
The great player, Mansoor Murugesan.

46
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:35,208
He is cleaning up.
Cleaning up both the sides.

47
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:37,875
Oh, no! He didn't take any point.
An empty raid.

48
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:39,625
Third raid!

49
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:41,042
Do or die raid.

50
00:05:41,042 --> 00:05:43,250
Let him come...

51
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:48,583
But, going towards Ashok is like
giving our head to the shark.

52
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:50,208
Hey, catch.
Didn't I tell?

53
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:52,083
Is it a just a catch?
An iguana catch.

54
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:54,333
Can you escape from Ashok's catch?

55
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:57,417
The 'South Boys team'
has scored one more point.

56
00:05:57,417 --> 00:05:58,958
If Dharmaraj takes a raid...

57
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:01,167
...it's like 'Yama, the lord of death'
 is going on ride.

58
00:06:01,167 --> 00:06:03,417
Wonderful game!

59
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:08,250
Wow! He took a point
by good reach.

60
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:10,250
All the raids by Anand is good.

61
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,292
Reach will be fast.
Come on. Don't be hurry.

62
00:06:12,292 --> 00:06:14,042
Kabaddi!

63
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:20,750
Look, how well he played!
Excellent skill!

64
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:23,833
Now, it's the turn of Sathyaraj.

65
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:25,542
Last year, he had played
in Tamil Nadu...

66
00:06:25,542 --> 00:06:26,542
Look, he is coming...

67
00:06:26,542 --> 00:06:27,750
He is a good player.

68
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,375
Catch him as I taught.

69
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:31,000
He will take point.
-Catch him, fast.

70
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,625
Throw away.

71
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:39,125
They got it.
Hey, go forward.

72
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:42,542
He is the gold of our hometown...
-Touch and hit.

73
00:06:42,542 --> 00:06:44,542
He is Subash.
-Catch him.

74
00:06:44,542 --> 00:06:46,083
He is going to get applause.

75
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:48,583
Oh, gosh! it became a fun.

76
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,000
As it's of no use on depending
the offence player...

77
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,250
...Ashok, the defence player has taken up.

78
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:56,750
Wonderful attempt!
-Kabaddi...

79
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:01,292
Good kick!
Ashok has scored a point.

80
00:07:01,292 --> 00:07:06,500
Anand is getting into field
 to do surgical strike.

81
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,833
Let him come.
Leave him to come forward.

82
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:12,250
Anand has done a great job!
-Kabaddi...

83
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:16,625
Anand made his team
 to lead the match.

84
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:18,292
Three points in a single raid.

85
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:20,875
Half-time
Side change.

86
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:21,708
It's over for Rastha.

87
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:25,583
Rastha Royals begins the raid.

88
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:29,292
As of now, the match is
favourable to 'Rastha Royal team'.

89
00:07:29,292 --> 00:07:30,583
Anand was out of the match.

90
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:35,125
They shot the tiger in the team.
Only 'Rastha Royal' is left.

91
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:37,375
What a difficult stance for the team?

92
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:39,917
Come on.
He got it.

93
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:43,833
Though Ashok caught him
 in right angle, he crossed the lobby.

94
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:49,125
Now, both the teams
are struggling without their captains.

95
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:51,667
Be careful.
-Let's see, who wins the match.

96
00:07:51,667 --> 00:07:54,542
He is coming!
Tackle him.

97
00:07:54,542 --> 00:07:57,750
Catch the player and score a point.
Don't squeeze the player.

98
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:02,042
Only if Sathyaraj scores a point,
 their captain Ashok can rejoin.

99
00:08:02,042 --> 00:08:09,917
Sathyaraj has scored a point.
Ashok has come to the field again.

100
00:08:09,917 --> 00:08:11,083
Last thirty seconds.

101
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:12,042
Third round.
Do or die raid.

102
00:08:12,042 --> 00:08:12,917
The last one.

103
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:15,958
Kabaddi...
Don't leave, Ashok.

104
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:17,583
The match will be serious now.

105
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:22,125
No one can tackle Anand in Kabaddi.
And no one was left by Ashok.

106
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:25,250
Who is going to win!
It'll be known now.

107
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:31,250
Kabaddi...

108
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:40,792
Both are out.

109
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:49,125
One point for 'Super South Boys'
and bonus point for 'Rastha Royal Tigers'.

110
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:54,667
The 'Rastha Royal Tigers team'
 won the match.

111
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:58,000
Both the teams have played well.
Congratulations to both the teams.

112
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,333
Now, our Chief guests will
distribute the prizes.

113
00:09:03,542 --> 00:09:06,375
Both of you played well.
-Thank you, sir.

114
00:09:06,375 --> 00:09:09,375
I've noted, you both didn't
give up at anytime.

115
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,625
But, I've a doubt.

116
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:13,458
Anand is good as an offence player
 and Ashok is good as defence player.

117
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:16,000
If both of you play together,
that team will be strong.

118
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,208
Why are you playing, separately?

119
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:19,833
How great the team is,
 it'll face the defeat, one day.

120
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:23,000
He might lose to me
and so I.

121
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,250
But, we both will never lose
 to others.

122
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:25,667
Excellent!

123
00:09:25,667 --> 00:09:29,167
"When we go to play,
 we will stand in opposite sides"

124
00:09:29,167 --> 00:09:32,583
"On the way out, we go
with our hands on the shoulders"

125
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:36,292
"No matter who wins,
we will dance and rejoice"

126
00:09:36,292 --> 00:09:38,292
"We will be strong"

127
00:09:40,708 --> 00:09:44,083
"We will be just looking
like problematic "

128
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:48,000
"We will give our life
to save a friend"

129
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,833
"The enigmatic path is our life"

130
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:55,042
"We will roam to rock
 the eight directions"

131
00:09:55,042 --> 00:09:58,583
"When we go to play,
 we will stand in opposite sides"

132
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:02,333
"On the way out, we go
with our hands on the shoulders"

133
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:06,042
"No matter who wins,
we will dance and rejoice"

134
00:10:06,042 --> 00:10:09,208
"We will be strong"

135
00:10:10,542 --> 00:10:13,042
Do you've ten rupees?
-Hey, get lost.

136
00:10:13,042 --> 00:10:16,833
You stay blessed.
You too stay blessed.

137
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:20,208
You must offer from your pocket.
Not from others.

138
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:22,917
If I've given from my pocket,
 he'd have blessed me.

139
00:10:22,917 --> 00:10:24,708
Now, he had blessed
 both of us, isn't it?

140
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:49,458
"Even if time keeps you
at an unspecified distance"

141
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:50,042
Hey!

142
00:10:50,042 --> 00:10:52,125
"When the trouble comes
the eyes search for the friend"

143
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:53,917
Nothing!
Come on.

144
00:10:53,917 --> 00:10:55,292
Hey, come aside.

145
00:10:55,292 --> 00:10:57,333
"Always kith and kin around"

146
00:10:57,333 --> 00:11:01,042
"Whatever it is,
a friend is a friend..."

147
00:11:01,042 --> 00:11:08,625
"Like a kite,
we will sway here and there"

148
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:16,333
"More and more...
the friend has love and bears us in heart".

149
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:19,833
"There is no example
for our friendship"

150
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:23,500
"We never asked to excuse
 our mistakes"

151
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:27,042
"We will not wish good morning
 and good evening for namesake"

152
00:11:27,042 --> 00:11:29,292
"This is our friendship!"

153
00:11:55,417 --> 00:11:57,042
Mam, is sir there?

154
00:11:57,042 --> 00:11:58,583
Who are you?
What's the matter?

155
00:11:58,583 --> 00:12:00,875
Sir has placed an order
for a cot.

156
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:02,125
Shall I bring inside?

157
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:03,250
Is it?
Bring it.

158
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:05,083
Hey, bring it.

159
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:06,458
Be careful.
Lift slowly.

160
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:08,000
Keep down for a minute.

161
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,250
What's this?
-Tell me, mam.

162
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:11,625
It looks like an old cot.

163
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:12,625
It's an old cot only.

164
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:14,167
But made of teakwood.

165
00:12:14,167 --> 00:12:15,667
Sir has placed an order for this.

166
00:12:15,667 --> 00:12:17,583
Don't want this cot.
Take it out.

167
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:18,292
Oh, no!

168
00:12:18,292 --> 00:12:20,458
Dear, you've asked for a cot.

169
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:21,750
It's made of teakwood.

170
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:24,292
If we buy a new one,
 it costs sixty thousand rupees.

171
00:12:24,292 --> 00:12:27,833
But I bought it for lesser cost,
 you deny it.

172
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:30,042
It's okay if you don't
 buy me a new cot.

173
00:12:30,042 --> 00:12:31,542
I'll sleep on the floor.

174
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:35,083
For that sake, don't bring old things
used by others to my house.

175
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:35,875
Do you understand?

176
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:38,167
She irates saying as new...

177
00:12:38,167 --> 00:12:38,750
Brother...

178
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,875
What to do?
Take away.

179
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:42,625
Take away, carefully.

180
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:44,583
Is it a new cup?
-Yes, dad.

181
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:46,333
Did you win?
-No, dad. I've stolen it.

182
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:47,333
You too tease me.

183
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:48,542
Go and show to your mom.
-Okay, dad.

184
00:12:48,542 --> 00:12:49,667
She is waiting for you.

185
00:12:49,667 --> 00:12:51,333
Where are you going?
-I'm going somewhere.

186
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:53,125
Who is showing respect to me?
Go...

187
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:55,375
If you talk like this,
 not respect even food will be denied.

188
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:59,083
Stacking these cups hurts my hand.
It looks beautiful.

189
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:00,042
Hey!
-What mom?

190
00:13:00,042 --> 00:13:02,167
When you know my brother
 is the Chief guest...

191
00:13:02,167 --> 00:13:03,792
...you'd have skipped.

192
00:13:03,792 --> 00:13:05,125
Instead, you're playing Kabaddi.

193
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:06,500
Mom, am I involved in pickpocket?

194
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,750
I went to play Kabaddi.

195
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,792
I'm seeking his daughter
as bride for you.

196
00:13:09,792 --> 00:13:14,875
If you play along with the wastrels,
how will he accept for the marriage?

197
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:15,750
Have you started?

198
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,875
Did I say, I'll marry your niece?

199
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:20,125
If you've such an imagination,
I'm not responsible for it.

200
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:21,250
Always saying the same...

201
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:32,167
You'll get a bride
if you win in life.

202
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,333
Win in life?

203
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:39,083
Mom, did he marry you only
after he won in life?

204
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:42,583
Not at all. He didn't have any job
even after marriage.

205
00:13:42,583 --> 00:13:45,125
My father got him a job
 in the income tax department.

206
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:48,750
In our days, we got married
 though we didn't have job.

207
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:50,875
Nowadays, so many queries
arising from bride's family.

208
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:53,417
That too, if you play Kabaddi,
 not the bride...

209
00:13:53,417 --> 00:13:55,125
...no one will give
even the photo of the bride.

210
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:57,792
If you proceed this way,
 I'll not get a bride in this life.

211
00:13:57,792 --> 00:14:01,292
How to find then?
-Ask like that.

212
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:05,417
What's this?
-An egg.

213
00:14:05,417 --> 00:14:06,667
Always thinking of eating.

214
00:14:06,667 --> 00:14:07,625
This is the world!

215
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:09,000
Ohhh!

216
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,833
What's this?
-You tell.

217
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:12,208
This is India.

218
00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:13,625
This is Tamil Nadu.

219
00:14:13,625 --> 00:14:21,875
These dots are the caste
which are prevailing here.

220
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:24,917
If you search in this single dot,
you'll not get a bride.

221
00:14:24,917 --> 00:14:27,250
You'll dock a few
in the name of astrology.

222
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:30,375
How will you get then?
Search widely.

223
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:32,750
Widely?
Let's search.

224
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:37,042
How long you search,
you can't get a bride like my niece.

225
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:40,542
Oh, gosh! I'm telling you
I don't want to get married.

226
00:14:40,542 --> 00:14:42,208
But, you keep talking
about your niece.

227
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:44,708
Are you going to be a saint
without getting married?

228
00:14:49,042 --> 00:14:52,917
I've an ambition
 and I'm going towards it.

229
00:14:52,917 --> 00:14:54,125
Don't disturb me.

230
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:57,583
This is like a rock.
Better, both of you eat it.

231
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:09,042
When he is saying about ambition,
why are you getting tensed?

232
00:15:09,042 --> 00:15:09,542
Then?

233
00:15:09,542 --> 00:15:11,208
His parents are calling me,
in the morning...

234
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:13,208
...and asking what's his ambition?

235
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:15,833
Don't I know his ambition?
Having tea in the nearby shop.

236
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:16,583
Hello!
-Thank you.

237
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:18,500
You're coming along.
-I've coffee.

238
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,375
Oh, great difference!

239
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:21,833
I'm frustrated as no one
 is willing to give me bride.

240
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:23,333
He too irates.

241
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:25,333
I don't know what's this nonsense.
He is a nuisance.

242
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:28,542
It's not good for health.
-English too...

243
00:15:28,542 --> 00:15:29,583
No, it's Bhojpuri.
-That's nothing, Appachi...

244
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:31,792
...When they suddenly asked,
 I don't know what to say.

245
00:15:31,792 --> 00:15:35,083
It's wrong to deny marriage
 like you do...

246
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:37,417
...and it's wrong to hanker
for marriage like him.

247
00:15:37,417 --> 00:15:39,958
You must be neutral
like me, isn't it, dude?

248
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:42,083
Why didn't you get a bride, yet?

249
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:43,750
How can I tell that?

250
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,250
People ask,are you working in
Ambani's company?

251
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:46,667
You're just working
 with Appachi.

252
00:15:46,667 --> 00:15:47,167
Isn't it?

253
00:15:47,167 --> 00:15:50,458
People say, they won't give bride
 for those working as collection agents.

254
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:51,708
It's a shame.

255
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:53,000
For you too...

256
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,167
I've brides queuing up.

257
00:15:54,167 --> 00:15:57,792
As you work in the finance companies,
 you're denied a bride, right?

258
00:15:57,792 --> 00:15:59,958
If you say,
 you own this company?

259
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:02,500
Already, they're saying the same.
-Is it?

260
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,958
If you tell us to thrash someone,
we'll do.

261
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:06,333
Don't tell us to say lies.

262
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:07,000
Look him!

263
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,417
I'm telling you the fact.

264
00:16:09,542 --> 00:16:11,333
I'm also getting old.

265
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:13,583
Who is there for me?
-I'm there.

266
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:15,292
Better, you take up the company.

267
00:16:15,292 --> 00:16:19,167
Even big banks have gone
bankruptcy lending huge money.

268
00:16:19,167 --> 00:16:21,125
I'm running this business
 for forty years.

269
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:25,917
Except,I've let a few people to live,
 I was never cheated by anyone.

270
00:16:25,917 --> 00:16:28,625
If you can run this
the same way,

271
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:30,292
I'll transfer the ownership to you.

272
00:16:30,292 --> 00:16:34,250
Else, I'll give to some passerby.

273
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:35,708
Don't get angry.

274
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:38,833
He is a small boy.
Doesn't know about your kind heart.

275
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:40,958
We'll run the business
 as good as you.

276
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,958
But, let's change the name.

277
00:16:43,917 --> 00:16:46,833
'Appachi finance' seems
to be an old name.

278
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:49,625
Shall we name it stylishly as,
 'Appacha finance'?

279
00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:50,667
Appacha...

280
00:16:50,667 --> 00:16:52,958
You won't be the right ones.

281
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:56,208
You might change the name,
 place and finally you'll change me.

282
00:16:56,208 --> 00:16:57,250
That's the plan.

283
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:00,750
Until I'm alive,
You're the partners in the business.

284
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:01,833
Partners?

285
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:05,000
So, we've to work without salary.

286
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,333
Yes, the accounts will be right,
 if you calculate it.

287
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:09,792
Only footwear will fly.

288
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:19,750
'Along those narrow streets,
when the people are going on...'

289
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:24,625
You're taking me
like a pilgrimage to Palani.

290
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:26,667
We would've come by bike.
How far is it to go, still?

291
00:17:26,667 --> 00:17:27,750
It's very near,
just ten kilometres.

292
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,083
Hey, no!
 I'll go back.

293
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:32,333
Instead of walking back for twenty kilometres,
 it's better to walk this ten kilometres.

294
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:33,542
Roads haven't been laid
to this town.

295
00:17:33,542 --> 00:17:35,083
But, you're coming with coolers.

296
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:36,292
Hold the umbrella, properly.

297
00:17:36,292 --> 00:17:38,167
You doesn't know about this town.

298
00:17:38,167 --> 00:17:40,583
Last week, people from Shriram chits
came to seize the bike.

299
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:40,917
Okay.

300
00:17:40,917 --> 00:17:42,833
Do you know what they did?
-What?

301
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:45,833
They grabbed the bikes of those
who came and thrashed them.

302
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:46,583
Then?

303
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:48,708
It's said, this is the native place
 of Vijay Mallya.

304
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:49,500
Keep overstating.

305
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,542
Is this the house?
-Yes.

306
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:51,583
Pandi brother!

307
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:53,708
Pandi brother!
-Who is that?

308
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:55,208
We have come from
 'Appachi finance'.

309
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:56,292
No one is in the house.

310
00:17:57,083 --> 00:17:58,958
I've a technique for these people.

311
00:17:58,958 --> 00:17:59,917
Watch now.

312
00:17:59,917 --> 00:18:00,958
Pandi.

313
00:18:01,792 --> 00:18:02,750
Hey, Pandi.

314
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:03,750
Who is this, now?

315
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,375
Panchayat elections are approaching.

316
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:07,208
That's why, we came to
 distribute money for votes.

317
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:08,458
Is there anyone in the house?

318
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:09,500
Is it!

319
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,750
Come in.

320
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:11,333
Come soon.

321
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:12,667
Look, how he opens
 his mouth wide?

322
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:16,083
I'll go inside, topple with
this umbrella in his mouth.

323
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:17,458
Come in, sir.

324
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:18,833
Didn't pay the due
for four months,

325
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:20,250
But, he wants a Royal Enfield bike.

326
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:22,750
Look, how is he sitting and eating.
-Come on.

327
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:23,875
Yeah, coming.

328
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:24,833
Brother!
-What?

329
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:27,083
Keep the cash ready.
-Okay.

330
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:28,292
We'll cast the vote, perfectly.

331
00:18:28,292 --> 00:18:30,750
Don't cheat by giving token etc...

332
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,625
But, you'll cheat not paying debts.

333
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:34,250
Who are you?

334
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:35,708
We're from 'Appachi finance'.

335
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:37,333
I told you that
no one is in the house.

336
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:39,250
Hey, if no one is in house,
 are you a ghost?

337
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:41,917
You can't pay the due
 for the bullet, but talk more?

338
00:18:41,917 --> 00:18:42,792
Who is Pandi, here?

339
00:18:42,792 --> 00:18:44,375
Pandi?

340
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:46,083
Ask as,'Bullet Pandi'.

341
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:47,208
He is my son.

342
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:48,083
Why?

343
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:49,958
He didn't pay the due
 for that bullet.

344
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:52,750
If not paid the due,
will you come to the house and ask?

345
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:54,250
Will we come to
 the toilet and ask?

346
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:57,667
If you've lend the money,
 you've to come to the toilet also.

347
00:18:57,667 --> 00:18:58,125
Do you know it?

348
00:18:58,125 --> 00:19:00,750
What's the hell
is he talking when having food?

349
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:03,083
Look dude, now the time
 isn't good.

350
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:05,625
The astrologer has told
not to give the money.

351
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:07,042
Come after two or three months.

352
00:19:07,042 --> 00:19:09,083
Let's see what to do.
-Then, let we do one thing.

353
00:19:09,417 --> 00:19:10,625
We'll take away the bullet.

354
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:12,917
You pay the due after
 three months and get it back.

355
00:19:12,917 --> 00:19:13,542
Come, let's go.

356
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:16,875
What is he doing?
-It's right that you people are outsiders.

357
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:19,750
You can't even take
 a hand full of mud from here.

358
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,208
That too, how dare are you...

359
00:19:21,208 --> 00:19:22,750
...to take away the bullet
from my house?

360
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:23,750
Hey, old goof!

361
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,417
We don't want mud,
we'll take the bullet.

362
00:19:25,417 --> 00:19:26,167
Leave us.

363
00:19:26,167 --> 00:19:27,292
Hey, dude!
-What?

364
00:19:27,292 --> 00:19:29,792
If you touch the bike,
 it's like touching my moustache.

365
00:19:29,792 --> 00:19:31,417
If you are bold enough,
touch it.

366
00:19:31,417 --> 00:19:32,875
Let me see,
it's either you or me!

367
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,417
You must stay away
and talk, don't come close.

368
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:38,125
Having a moustache
like a vessel cleaning scrub,

369
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:40,083
...you utter punch dialogues too?

370
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:42,292
Who asked you to say
 punch dialogues?

371
00:19:42,292 --> 00:19:45,500
You scrub faced,
you couldn't repay the debts.

372
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,917
Dude, give me a chance.

373
00:19:46,917 --> 00:19:49,042
You go and handle the bike.
-I'll handle him.

374
00:19:49,042 --> 00:19:50,833
You hold it.
-Give me.

375
00:19:51,917 --> 00:19:54,833
If you've a big moustache beneath the nose,
will you speak harsh?

376
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:56,917
The moustache has covered
 half of the mouth.

377
00:19:56,917 --> 00:19:58,292
You speak more with this.

378
00:19:58,292 --> 00:19:59,042
Come on.

379
00:19:59,792 --> 00:20:01,708
Why are you holding him?

380
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:03,667
Leave him.
-Where am I holding him?

381
00:20:03,667 --> 00:20:05,167
My hand got stuck.

382
00:20:05,167 --> 00:20:06,292
It's not coming.

383
00:20:06,292 --> 00:20:07,208
Leave him.

384
00:20:07,667 --> 00:20:11,083
His moustache has come along.
He is pelting the stone.

385
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:12,000
Hey, go away.
-Stop.

386
00:20:13,542 --> 00:20:15,750
Oh, no! Appachi, it's deficit of
four thousand rupees this month too.

387
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,292
Four thousand rupees!

388
00:20:17,292 --> 00:20:19,000
New coolers.
-Hey, it's four rupees.

389
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,042
You say as four thousand.

390
00:20:20,042 --> 00:20:21,750
The company's name is oakley.
And you haven't seen it.

391
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:22,208
Damn it.

392
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:25,208
You know the Puliyur people
 will create ruckus.

393
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:26,708
Why are you lending them loans?

394
00:20:26,917 --> 00:20:28,375
Those who don't create ruckus
will go to the banks.

395
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:29,917
Those who create ruckus
will come here only.

396
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:31,208
You mean, Puliyur?

397
00:20:32,292 --> 00:20:33,417
Where did you go at Puliyur?

398
00:20:33,417 --> 00:20:34,500
Pandi...

399
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,500
We gave a bullet, right?
-Yes.

400
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,167
It's him.

401
00:20:36,167 --> 00:20:37,125
Oh, no!

402
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:40,042
He has paid
four months due, yesterday.

403
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,208
Did he pay the due, yesterday?
-Doing everything faulty…

404
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:43,333
…and wearing coolers too.

405
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:44,542
What to do with you?

406
00:20:45,417 --> 00:20:47,292
Bottle, you give back the bullet keys.
-Oh, gosh!

407
00:20:47,292 --> 00:20:48,792
It seems to be a good tale.
You go...

408
00:20:48,792 --> 00:20:50,792
I've more work.
-No, I can't.

409
00:20:50,792 --> 00:20:52,333
Why are you quarreling?

410
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:53,250
Pandi will come.

411
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:54,500
Talk to him and give the bike.

412
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:59,083
Hey! Who has taken my brother's bullet?

413
00:20:59,542 --> 00:21:00,125
They have come.

414
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:02,375
If you're bold enough
to be a man, come out.

415
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:03,458
There are no men, here.
Go away.

416
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:04,167
Good!

417
00:21:04,167 --> 00:21:06,708
Who touched my father's moustache?

418
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:09,250
Come out.

419
00:21:09,708 --> 00:21:10,792
Did you touch the moustache?

420
00:21:10,792 --> 00:21:11,833
Is that very important now?

421
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:12,833
Go and convince them.

422
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:13,917
Else, they will keep shouting.
-Dude,

423
00:21:13,917 --> 00:21:15,667
Don't create ruckus
 instead of convincing.

424
00:21:15,667 --> 00:21:16,792
I'm going to convince.

425
00:21:16,792 --> 00:21:17,792
Appachi, tell them.

426
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:21,167
I told you to collect the money
but you've grabbed his moustache.

427
00:21:21,167 --> 00:21:21,958
Oh, no! It's not me.
Only him.

428
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:23,333
Appachi, I didn't grab it.

429
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:24,250
It came on it's own.

430
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:25,250
What can I do?

431
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:26,500
If the police complaint is filed,

432
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,375
I'll not spend money.
Be careful.

433
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:29,625
Else, you'll give as bundles.

434
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:30,583
You go.

435
00:21:30,583 --> 00:21:31,542
They will hit me.
I'll not go.

436
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:32,958
Sorry, brother.

437
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,208
A small mistake has happened.

438
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:35,917
Who took the bullet?

439
00:21:35,917 --> 00:21:36,750
Ask him to come out.

440
00:21:36,958 --> 00:21:40,083
Thinking that you didn't pay
 the due, our guys took the bike.

441
00:21:40,292 --> 00:21:41,667
Here is the keys.
Take the bike and go.

442
00:21:41,667 --> 00:21:44,458
Hey, you shouldn't take the bike
 even if haven't paid the due.

443
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:46,500
I've paid the money,
 how will you bring the bike then?

444
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,917
Are you dare enough?

445
00:21:47,917 --> 00:21:49,667
A mistake has happened this time.

446
00:21:49,667 --> 00:21:51,250
I'll take care, hereafter.

447
00:21:51,417 --> 00:21:52,750
Don't create ruckus.
Take the bike.

448
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:55,042
Hey, the bike is nothing to me.

449
00:21:55,042 --> 00:21:57,458
Call the one who touched
 my dad's moustache.

450
00:21:57,458 --> 00:21:59,500
I'll not leave from here
unless I cut his hand.

451
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,542
Yeah, it's our mistake, brother.
I punished him.

452
00:22:02,042 --> 00:22:03,583
I apologize to you
instead of him.

453
00:22:03,583 --> 00:22:04,167
What?

454
00:22:04,417 --> 00:22:06,125
Do you apologize instead of him?

455
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,583
Will you give birth
 to a child if he gets married?

456
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:11,208
Call him.

457
00:22:18,167 --> 00:22:21,292
Hey, only the customer should lend
 his hand and take money from us.

458
00:22:21,292 --> 00:22:22,750
We shouldn't stretch our hand.

459
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:23,958
It's all because of you.

460
00:22:23,958 --> 00:22:24,917
Do you know what he said?

461
00:22:24,917 --> 00:22:25,625
Shut your trap and go.

462
00:22:26,875 --> 00:22:28,500
How dare you touch him?

463
00:22:35,375 --> 00:22:36,208
They have started the fighting.

464
00:22:36,208 --> 00:22:36,917
Come, let's take leave
 and go home.

465
00:22:36,917 --> 00:22:38,583
No, let's go and have a tea.

466
00:22:42,292 --> 00:22:43,583
So, he started.

467
00:22:51,583 --> 00:22:52,625
Bhai, two cups of tea.

468
00:22:52,625 --> 00:22:53,708
He has scolded me
 before everyone.

469
00:22:53,708 --> 00:22:55,125
Is it new?
Leave it.

470
00:22:55,125 --> 00:22:56,833
Ashok, what's the problem?

471
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:58,125
Anand is thrashing everyone.

472
00:22:58,125 --> 00:22:59,958
Does he need a reason
to create ruckus?

473
00:23:00,125 --> 00:23:02,125
He is thrashing everyone
as he has long hands and legs.

474
00:23:44,917 --> 00:23:46,292
Bhai, who is he?

475
00:23:46,292 --> 00:23:47,792
He is an outsider.
-That's it.

476
00:23:47,792 --> 00:23:49,375
Who will have tea in your shop?

477
00:23:51,208 --> 00:23:53,583
You shouldn't drink like that.
You have it like this.

478
00:23:53,583 --> 00:23:54,792
You shouldn't drink in hurry.
-Ashok, no...

479
00:23:54,792 --> 00:23:56,125
Don't pour down...

480
00:24:06,875 --> 00:24:08,125
The earlobe was torn.

481
00:24:30,667 --> 00:24:32,583
Will this head to the police station?

482
00:24:32,583 --> 00:24:33,500
It'll go till the prison.

483
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:36,500
He must be imprisoned
under Goondas act.

484
00:24:42,375 --> 00:24:45,500
All my positive attitudes
are hiding his negativity.

485
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,833
That's why, everyone trusts him
to be good.

486
00:24:56,833 --> 00:24:57,542
Hey!

487
00:25:03,292 --> 00:25:04,708
Oh, no!

488
00:25:09,833 --> 00:25:12,083
Don't go that side.
He might bang you.

489
00:25:12,083 --> 00:25:13,208
Go this way.

490
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:20,417
Hey, are you watching IPL match?

491
00:25:20,417 --> 00:25:22,542
Go and stop the fighting.
He might kill someone.

492
00:25:24,417 --> 00:25:25,542
Oh, no!

493
00:25:32,875 --> 00:25:34,375
It's enough!

494
00:25:34,375 --> 00:25:37,500
Already, everyone looks like
the photo in Aadhar card.

495
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,917
Don't send everyone to prison
 for the sake of small moustache.

496
00:25:39,917 --> 00:25:41,625
Come on.

497
00:25:42,792 --> 00:25:43,667
Go...

498
00:25:51,167 --> 00:25:52,208
Tell me, dad.

499
00:25:52,417 --> 00:25:54,375
Is my son next to you?

500
00:25:54,375 --> 00:25:55,750
He isn't here, dad.
What's the matter?

501
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:58,958
Nothing, you know how tough
 it is to find a bride for Ashok.

502
00:25:58,958 --> 00:26:00,958
Yes dad. It's tough.
-Is this how you speak?

503
00:26:00,958 --> 00:26:03,208
Last week, he got furious
for not looking a bride for him...

504
00:26:03,208 --> 00:26:06,250
...he drew an image,marked the parts
and humiliated us.

505
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:09,500
So, I pleaded the matchmaker
 and selected a bride.

506
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,000
On coming Wednesday,
we'll go to see the bride.

507
00:26:11,375 --> 00:26:12,125
Convey this to him.

508
00:26:12,125 --> 00:26:12,958
Okay, dad.
I'll tell him.

509
00:26:13,542 --> 00:26:15,583
Dad, do you've the photo
of the bride?

510
00:26:15,583 --> 00:26:17,083
Photo?
Why?

511
00:26:17,708 --> 00:26:18,250
No, dad.

512
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:20,625
If he doesn't like the bride
after going there...

513
00:26:20,625 --> 00:26:21,875
...it'll be a disgrace to all of us.

514
00:26:21,875 --> 00:26:22,542
That's why, I said.

515
00:26:22,542 --> 00:26:24,708
Will he say that
he doesn't like the bride?

516
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:27,250
Let us see, whether the bride
 likes him, first?

517
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:28,500
That's also right, dad.

518
00:26:28,958 --> 00:26:29,875
Where does the bride
belong to?

519
00:26:29,875 --> 00:26:30,875
Pillayarpatti.

520
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:32,792
Pillayarpatti?

521
00:26:33,667 --> 00:26:34,667
Where is the location?

522
00:26:34,667 --> 00:26:37,667
Opposite to the temple, the house
 at the right side is, 'Malliga Illam'.

523
00:26:37,667 --> 00:26:39,542
Yes, 'Malliga Illam'

524
00:26:39,542 --> 00:26:41,458
No.79, Red colour gate.
Is that house, dad?

525
00:26:41,458 --> 00:26:44,833
Only one 'Malliga Illam' is there
on that street.

526
00:26:44,833 --> 00:26:45,708
That's the bride's house.

527
00:26:45,708 --> 00:26:47,375
Go to the temple and come soon.
-Okay, dad!

528
00:26:47,375 --> 00:26:48,208
Okay, mom.

529
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:07,708
Please.

530
00:28:07,708 --> 00:28:08,250
Go.

531
00:28:20,208 --> 00:28:21,333
Aunty!
-Kavya!

532
00:28:21,333 --> 00:28:22,583
How are you?
-I'm doing good.

533
00:28:22,583 --> 00:28:23,333
Get me the bill.

534
00:28:23,333 --> 00:28:25,458
Bill this along with mine.
-Okay.

535
00:28:25,458 --> 00:28:27,042
I saw you when you went
this side.

536
00:28:27,042 --> 00:28:28,792
I was waiting for you
to come here.

537
00:28:28,958 --> 00:28:29,625
What happened?

538
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:31,292
Someone is following me
 for long time.

539
00:28:31,292 --> 00:28:32,208
I have sent him.

540
00:28:32,208 --> 00:28:33,167
Aunty, what are you saying?

541
00:28:33,167 --> 00:28:36,083
He is Anand's friend, Ashok.

542
00:28:36,083 --> 00:28:38,750
As I said you're going to
get married to Anand...

543
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:40,375
...he is coming around you.

544
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,333
What's your name?
-Kavya.

545
00:28:44,917 --> 00:28:46,750
What are you studying?
-I'm doing MCA.

546
00:28:47,375 --> 00:28:48,958
You should do higher studies
 like me.

547
00:28:49,125 --> 00:28:52,500
What did you study?
-I did diploma in...

548
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,417
Why do you need?

549
00:28:53,625 --> 00:28:54,500
Do you know to cook?

550
00:28:55,375 --> 00:28:56,167
Do you know to eat?

551
00:28:57,250 --> 00:28:58,500
It's known well
 when looking at you.

552
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,375
Aunty!
-Hey, be quiet.

553
00:29:00,375 --> 00:29:01,958
It's getting late.
You leave.

554
00:29:01,958 --> 00:29:03,833
Convey my regards to my brother
 and sister-in-law.

555
00:29:03,833 --> 00:29:05,000
Bye, aunty.
-Go carefully.

556
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:06,125
Just a minute.

557
00:29:08,875 --> 00:29:09,417
Take this.

558
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:10,417
Thank you.

559
00:29:10,417 --> 00:29:11,667
I expected you will deny.

560
00:29:11,792 --> 00:29:12,500
Why?

561
00:29:12,583 --> 00:29:14,375
You go, dear.
-Just for fun, mom.

562
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:15,667
How is the bride?

563
00:29:15,667 --> 00:29:18,500
She is looking plumpy and cute.

564
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,458
Your friend doesn't want
to marry her.

565
00:29:20,458 --> 00:29:21,792
Don't worry.

566
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:23,250
I'll convince him to get married.

567
00:29:23,667 --> 00:29:26,417
Can I believe you?
We have told him a lot.

568
00:29:27,042 --> 00:29:28,875
Mom, are we both the same?

569
00:29:29,125 --> 00:29:30,458
I'm Ashok.
His friend.

570
00:29:30,792 --> 00:29:31,833
He'll obey me.

571
00:29:32,875 --> 00:29:34,042
It's the final.
Okay?

572
00:29:34,042 --> 00:29:35,125
Are you going to throw shotput?

573
00:29:35,125 --> 00:29:36,708
It's a game.
Do you know?

574
00:29:36,708 --> 00:29:37,292
Look now.

575
00:29:38,292 --> 00:29:39,542
How it's thrown!

576
00:29:39,958 --> 00:29:40,750
Look now.

577
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:43,542
Well done.

578
00:29:43,958 --> 00:29:44,833
How is it?

579
00:29:44,833 --> 00:29:46,250
It pierced for forty times.

580
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:48,708
Look, I'll accept if you say
that you're the captain for Kabaddi.

581
00:29:48,708 --> 00:29:50,708
But, I'm playing this game
 for years together.

582
00:29:50,708 --> 00:29:52,125
This game has warm-up too.

583
00:29:52,125 --> 00:29:53,125
On the whole, only it pierced
for four times.

584
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:55,792
You've become old.
You don't have clear visibility..

585
00:29:55,792 --> 00:29:57,792
You must behave honestly
 like a gentleman.

586
00:29:57,792 --> 00:29:59,042
You don't have that.

587
00:29:59,042 --> 00:30:00,417
I'll not play with you.
-Wonder, you say that?

588
00:30:00,417 --> 00:30:03,375
I shouldn't have befriended you.

589
00:30:03,375 --> 00:30:03,708
Go away.

590
00:30:03,708 --> 00:30:06,250
Don't be angry.
I'll get you food.

591
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:07,708
I'm not coming.
-Don't be angry.

592
00:30:07,708 --> 00:30:09,417
Dude!
-What?

593
00:30:09,417 --> 00:30:11,792
Your mom has selected
a bride studying MCA.

594
00:30:11,792 --> 00:30:15,042
You're playing with wastrels.
Aren't you ashamed?

595
00:30:15,042 --> 00:30:16,708
Hey, I said I'll not come.
did you heed me?

596
00:30:16,708 --> 00:30:18,000
You've tied a bandage too.

597
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,542
Tell him.

598
00:30:19,542 --> 00:30:21,542
He will get angry.

599
00:30:21,542 --> 00:30:22,875
Is she my uncle's daughter?

600
00:30:22,875 --> 00:30:24,792
Just now I met her.

601
00:30:24,792 --> 00:30:27,792
You get married to her.
I gave word to your mom.

602
00:30:27,792 --> 00:30:30,042
Leave it.
I've seen a bride for you.

603
00:30:30,042 --> 00:30:33,083
You?
-Not me.

604
00:30:33,083 --> 00:30:35,500
It's your father who has selected
a bride for you. I saw her.

605
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:38,167
Not for namesake.
She looks awesome!

606
00:30:38,167 --> 00:30:40,375
She will bleed if pinched.

607
00:30:40,375 --> 00:30:42,250
When did you last see
 your Uncle's daughter?

608
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:44,083
That's long back.
So what?

609
00:30:44,083 --> 00:30:46,292
Look her now.
She will bleed without pinching.

610
00:30:46,292 --> 00:30:47,542
Was she hurt?

611
00:30:47,542 --> 00:30:48,833
I said she is fair.

612
00:30:48,833 --> 00:30:52,917
You both adore the brides in turns
fixed for you.

613
00:30:52,917 --> 00:30:54,250
Good friendship!

614
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:55,750
Why are you jealous?
-Wonderful!

615
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:56,417
Leave it.

616
00:30:56,417 --> 00:30:58,625
I wish to see those brides
 when you admire.

617
00:30:58,625 --> 00:30:59,625
Take me too.

618
00:30:59,625 --> 00:31:01,250
Why? Should they run away?

619
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:03,625
Leave my hand.
-Dude, your uncle's daughter...

620
00:31:03,625 --> 00:31:04,667
Go away.

621
00:31:04,667 --> 00:31:06,125
I say only for your goodness.

622
00:31:06,125 --> 00:31:07,792
Will you listen or not?

623
00:31:07,792 --> 00:31:08,958
I'll listen. Tell me.

624
00:31:08,958 --> 00:31:10,875
Where is he?

625
00:31:18,292 --> 00:31:19,458
What?

626
00:31:28,458 --> 00:31:33,167
"Who made that painting
 to step out?"

627
00:31:33,167 --> 00:31:37,958
"Has the time come
to hang it in your house?"

628
00:31:37,958 --> 00:31:42,958
"Has the glass house
had an eye on her?"

629
00:31:42,958 --> 00:31:47,417
"When she stood in front,
eyes were glaring"

630
00:31:47,417 --> 00:31:48,625
"She is not the beauty
of the world"

631
00:31:48,625 --> 00:31:49,833
"She is not the moon"

632
00:31:49,833 --> 00:31:52,125
"She seems to be friendly
 to move on"

633
00:31:52,125 --> 00:31:54,708
"Not much smile,
Not much fair..."

634
00:31:54,708 --> 00:31:57,208
"She rocks like a beautiful painting"

635
00:31:57,208 --> 00:31:58,292
"She comes likes a poetry"

636
00:31:58,292 --> 00:31:59,458
"She comes like a dream"

637
00:31:59,458 --> 00:32:01,583
"She suits you, perfectly"

638
00:32:01,667 --> 00:32:06,292
"She is for you,
the locale Ellora painting"

639
00:32:07,208 --> 00:32:08,833
Who?
Is it her?

640
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:10,958
Go away.

641
00:32:11,458 --> 00:32:14,000
"She is your uncle's daughter!"

642
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,083
"Her eyes resembles
the eyes of a fish"

643
00:32:16,083 --> 00:32:18,542
"She is the right pair for you"

644
00:32:18,542 --> 00:32:20,958
"I wondered looking her"

645
00:32:20,958 --> 00:32:23,375
"What could I say?"

646
00:32:23,375 --> 00:32:25,708
"She is the most beauteous"

647
00:32:25,708 --> 00:32:30,417
"Everyday, step by step...
Practice to say, 'I love you'..."

648
00:32:45,375 --> 00:32:48,042
Hey, it's enough!

649
00:32:48,042 --> 00:32:49,250
Hey!

650
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:51,625
Shall I sing about your bride?
Listen it.

651
00:32:51,625 --> 00:32:53,125
Are you going to sing?

652
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:55,875
Let me listen.

653
00:32:55,875 --> 00:33:00,542
"The angel I saw
didn't have the wings, really"

654
00:33:00,542 --> 00:33:05,167
"I've never seen a woman
 like her, recently"

655
00:33:05,167 --> 00:33:10,167
"Though she is standing
 on the shore, she floats, gently"

656
00:33:10,167 --> 00:33:14,833
"She is a peacock moulded
with gold"

657
00:33:14,833 --> 00:33:16,292
"Plucked plenty of flowers"

658
00:33:16,292 --> 00:33:19,375
"And like sprinkled honey
on leftovers is her beauty"

659
00:33:19,375 --> 00:33:20,875
"In a fearful glance..."

660
00:33:20,875 --> 00:33:24,375
"One of the elated poetry,
Should be on print"

661
00:33:24,375 --> 00:33:26,750
"Like a mole on the Katchatheevu"

662
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:29,208
"She is a like a green foliage"

663
00:33:29,208 --> 00:33:30,083
"She is so beautiful"

664
00:33:30,083 --> 00:33:31,500
"She is..."

665
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,958
"Can fall for her"

666
00:33:34,375 --> 00:33:38,042
I wish to see her.
-Is it? come on.

667
00:33:38,208 --> 00:33:41,292
"Her eyes are the poetic page"

668
00:33:41,292 --> 00:33:43,250
"I saw her pure shyness in that"

669
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:45,667
"If she comes forward and stands"

670
00:33:45,667 --> 00:33:48,083
"The moon will stand behind her"

671
00:33:48,083 --> 00:33:52,833
"On the whole, no one
 in this locale is like her"

672
00:33:52,833 --> 00:33:57,917
"If she comes by your side,
 you will fly in the sky"

673
00:34:28,333 --> 00:34:30,542
Oh, my goodness!
 The house is locked.

674
00:34:30,542 --> 00:34:32,083
Sakthi, Kavya,
get down, carefully.

675
00:34:32,083 --> 00:34:33,417
Do you've the umbrella?

676
00:34:33,417 --> 00:34:34,625
Why do you come
without the umbrella?

677
00:34:34,625 --> 00:34:35,417
Dad, the house is locked.

678
00:34:35,417 --> 00:34:36,167
Didn't you inform,
we're coming?

679
00:34:37,792 --> 00:34:39,000
How can we come
 without informing?

680
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,292
Our bride's house is upstairs.

681
00:34:40,292 --> 00:34:41,708
What? Upstairs?

682
00:34:41,708 --> 00:34:43,208
The downstairs girl
will look beautiful.

683
00:34:43,208 --> 00:34:45,958
Can we go to the houses
 where the girls are beautiful?

684
00:34:45,958 --> 00:34:47,667
We've to see the girl residing upstairs.

685
00:34:47,667 --> 00:34:49,375
Come on, everyone.

686
00:34:49,375 --> 00:34:50,708
You keep talking.

687
00:34:50,708 --> 00:34:51,542
Welcome!

688
00:34:51,542 --> 00:34:52,583
Welcome, dude!

689
00:34:52,583 --> 00:34:55,167
Brother, I've seen the downstairs girl.
 She looks beautiful.

690
00:34:55,167 --> 00:34:56,625
Is the girl residing upstairs also
 look beautiful?

691
00:34:56,625 --> 00:35:00,458
Doesn't she look beautiful
when the downstairs girl is beautiful?

692
00:35:00,458 --> 00:35:01,083
Go...

693
00:35:01,083 --> 00:35:03,375
See the bride and fix the date.
-He is speaking without any logic.

694
00:35:03,375 --> 00:35:05,792
Hey, what are you talking there?
Come on.

695
00:35:05,792 --> 00:35:07,000
Are you going to pay me?

696
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,083
Greetings!

697
00:35:08,083 --> 00:35:08,875
Are you good?

698
00:35:08,875 --> 00:35:10,083
Greetings, son-in-law!
Welcome!

699
00:35:10,083 --> 00:35:12,500
Son-in-law?
Welcome, son-in-law

700
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,542
All the best.

701
00:35:13,542 --> 00:35:15,375
Welcome, son-in-law.

702
00:35:15,375 --> 00:35:16,917
Welcome, son-in-law.

703
00:35:16,917 --> 00:35:19,167
I'm the bridegroom.
Don't call everyone as son-in-law.

704
00:35:19,167 --> 00:35:20,958
Okay, welcome son-in-law.

705
00:35:20,958 --> 00:35:22,083
The light looks good, isn't it?
-Yes!

706
00:35:22,083 --> 00:35:24,125
Just now you've come.
Wait, they will give.

707
00:35:24,125 --> 00:35:25,583
What does he need?

708
00:35:25,583 --> 00:35:26,292
Don't know.

709
00:35:26,292 --> 00:35:27,333
Where is he?

710
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:28,833
Why is he more curious
 than me to see her?

711
00:35:28,833 --> 00:35:30,917
You saw her,
 on that day, right?

712
00:35:30,917 --> 00:35:32,250
I've seen her on that day.

713
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:35,583
I just want to see
how she comes before you.

714
00:35:35,583 --> 00:35:37,417
Hope you won't you forget us
after marriage?

715
00:35:37,417 --> 00:35:39,375
Why should I get along
with you all after marriage?

716
00:35:39,375 --> 00:35:42,792
After leaving from here,
 we will part ways.

717
00:35:42,792 --> 00:35:45,042
Oh, god!
Take the juice.

718
00:35:45,042 --> 00:35:46,750
Thank you, sister.

719
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:48,667
Hey, why did you say
as sister?

720
00:35:48,667 --> 00:35:50,125
Oh, sorry!
Thank you, sister-in-law.

721
00:35:50,125 --> 00:35:51,792
She is the bride!

722
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,667
Don't make fun.
You're pranking me, right?

723
00:36:01,667 --> 00:36:03,958
I swear, she is the bride.

724
00:36:13,208 --> 00:36:15,125
In this...

725
00:36:15,125 --> 00:36:16,000
Hey come here.

726
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,167
Is she the bride?

727
00:36:17,167 --> 00:36:18,875
Did you see her?
-Yes, I saw.

728
00:36:18,875 --> 00:36:20,167
What?

729
00:36:20,167 --> 00:36:22,167
Who is she?
-I too have the same doubt.

730
00:36:22,167 --> 00:36:26,125
It's tough to get a bride, nowadays.
-Okay.

731
00:36:26,125 --> 00:36:27,667
Hello!

732
00:36:27,667 --> 00:36:29,708
That too for both of us,
it's very tough.

733
00:36:29,708 --> 00:36:30,667
So?

734
00:36:31,208 --> 00:36:33,000
Don't look for beauty.
Look for character.

735
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,208
I'll tell, she is perfect for you.

736
00:36:34,208 --> 00:36:36,542
What's the character you've noted
for just giving soft drinks?

737
00:36:36,542 --> 00:36:38,167
Have you seen her
after giving soft drinks?

738
00:36:38,167 --> 00:36:39,667
She went back
without lifting her head.

739
00:36:39,667 --> 00:36:41,583
We will not get such a bride.

740
00:36:41,583 --> 00:36:44,667
She must have neck sprain.
I'm getting nervous.

741
00:36:44,667 --> 00:36:45,750
Everyone is watching us.

742
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:48,833
Nod your head for everything.
Let's talk after going home.

743
00:36:50,292 --> 00:36:52,625
After nodding here,
what to say at home?

744
00:36:52,625 --> 00:36:53,958
I didn't like the bride.

745
00:36:53,958 --> 00:36:57,792
Tell them, I'll revert
after I go home.

746
00:36:57,792 --> 00:37:03,292
Bridegroom, do you like the girl
or do you like her very much?

747
00:37:06,083 --> 00:37:07,208
You stupid.

748
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:11,458
Bridegroom feels shy.

749
00:37:12,292 --> 00:37:13,417
I want to speak to the bride.

750
00:37:13,417 --> 00:37:16,000
You can talk for long time
after marriage.

751
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,708
Won't they mistake
 if you want to talk now?

752
00:37:18,708 --> 00:37:22,125
In-law, the bride wants
 to talk with the bridegroom.

753
00:37:22,125 --> 00:37:23,750
Most welcome...

754
00:37:27,208 --> 00:37:30,750
Hey, speak politely to the bride.

755
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:32,208
Don't hurt her. Okay?

756
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:33,667
You shut up.
-Okay.

757
00:37:33,667 --> 00:37:35,417
Speak boldly.
-He'll speak.

758
00:37:37,167 --> 00:37:38,708
She is waiting upstairs.

759
00:37:38,708 --> 00:37:40,292
You don't worry for anything.

760
00:37:45,292 --> 00:37:48,042
Don't you regret
what you've done is wrong?

761
00:37:48,667 --> 00:37:51,208
I'm asking you, reply me.

762
00:37:51,208 --> 00:37:52,500
You advice others.

763
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:55,542
But, what you did is right?
-Don't make me laugh.Be quiet.

764
00:37:55,542 --> 00:37:56,875
Pity on her.

765
00:37:56,875 --> 00:37:59,917
How she would have felt,
when you denied her before everyone?

766
00:37:59,917 --> 00:38:00,792
What's the secret
they both are talking?

767
00:38:00,792 --> 00:38:04,375
I feel ashame to say you
 as my friend.

768
00:38:04,375 --> 00:38:06,083
I'm talking to you.
Open your mouth and speak.

769
00:38:06,083 --> 00:38:07,083
Open your mouth.

770
00:38:07,083 --> 00:38:08,708
Why are you staring?
-You shut your mouth.

771
00:38:09,875 --> 00:38:10,708
What?

772
00:38:16,167 --> 00:38:16,958
Actually...

773
00:38:16,958 --> 00:38:21,208
From my childhood,
I've more dreams about my husband.

774
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,625
Even you can think, why is she
having an arranged marriage...

775
00:38:26,625 --> 00:38:29,375
...instead of love marriage?

776
00:38:29,375 --> 00:38:32,792
Many people like you
 proposed their love to me.

777
00:38:32,792 --> 00:38:35,458
But, I didn't accept anyone.

778
00:38:35,458 --> 00:38:40,125
I like guys who look like the stars Ramarajan,
Rajkiran and Napoleon.

779
00:38:41,083 --> 00:38:44,750
So, I think you'd have understood
what I mean?

780
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:48,083
No, I can't understand.

781
00:38:48,083 --> 00:38:50,208
I mean, I don't like you.

782
00:38:50,208 --> 00:38:51,167
What?

783
00:38:51,833 --> 00:38:53,042
Come again.

784
00:38:53,042 --> 00:38:58,958
I mean, I don't like you.
I don't like you.

785
00:39:01,542 --> 00:39:04,083
It's gone!

786
00:39:05,833 --> 00:39:08,458
She doesn't like you, great!

787
00:39:09,542 --> 00:39:13,042
From the time we went
to the bride's house...

788
00:39:13,042 --> 00:39:15,000
...he said he doesn't like
 the bride.

789
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,500
Instead of bringing him back,

790
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:20,083
You were waiting till the bride denies
and made him ashamed.

791
00:39:20,083 --> 00:39:21,542
Fatso!
-Don't poke him.

792
00:39:21,542 --> 00:39:23,583
Tell me, stick man.
-Do you know one thing?

793
00:39:23,583 --> 00:39:25,792
What's that?
-Thousand proposals came for me.

794
00:39:25,792 --> 00:39:28,583
All the proposals had problem
 with horoscope and status.

795
00:39:28,583 --> 00:39:30,458
But, no one turned down
citing as they didn't like me.

796
00:39:30,458 --> 00:39:31,250
Do you hear me?

797
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:33,375
No one said
 they don't like me.

798
00:39:33,375 --> 00:39:34,792
Do you know this?

799
00:39:34,792 --> 00:39:37,083
You made me
to get teased by him.

800
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:39,042
I came trusting your words, isn't it?

801
00:39:39,042 --> 00:39:40,625
How you sang?
Do you remember?

802
00:39:40,625 --> 00:39:42,417
I forgot.
-I remember it.

803
00:39:42,417 --> 00:39:44,500
"Plucking numerous flowers
 and spilling the honey..."

804
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,625
"...that's how her beauty is".

805
00:39:46,625 --> 00:39:48,042
Who?
Was she?

806
00:39:48,042 --> 00:39:50,083
That is...
the bride was mistaken.

807
00:39:50,083 --> 00:39:51,083
That's your fault.

808
00:39:51,083 --> 00:39:53,583
Will you convince me
and get married to her?

809
00:39:53,583 --> 00:39:55,208
She is pityful.

810
00:39:55,208 --> 00:39:56,750
I'll not forgive you.

811
00:39:56,750 --> 00:39:58,250
Never look at my face.

812
00:39:58,250 --> 00:39:59,750
Thank you.
-You too.

813
00:40:00,083 --> 00:40:00,833
Look!

814
00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:06,042
Wait, you'll reap the fruit definitely.

815
00:40:11,333 --> 00:40:12,833
Dude, lie-down like Schumacher
and do the work.

816
00:40:12,833 --> 00:40:14,125
I'll get sprain, then.

817
00:40:14,125 --> 00:40:16,333
Hey!
They made it.

818
00:40:16,333 --> 00:40:17,917
Brother, I need the bike, urgently.

819
00:40:17,917 --> 00:40:19,208
Why?
any accident?

820
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:21,083
Take the Jeep and go.
-Brother, simply asking what happened?

821
00:40:21,083 --> 00:40:22,500
They have hit one of our guy.

822
00:40:22,792 --> 00:40:24,458
Who did they hit?
-Our Nandu kunji!

823
00:40:24,458 --> 00:40:26,250
Hey, I didn’t ask where they hit.

824
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:28,000
But, who got hit?
-That’s what, I said!

825
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,792
They hit “Nandu kunji”
on his chest.

826
00:40:29,792 --> 00:40:31,167
Hey, you dump head.
Why did they hit him?

827
00:40:31,167 --> 00:40:32,583
Last week, he hit them!

828
00:40:32,583 --> 00:40:34,000
Then, why did he hit them?

829
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,875
Since, a week before
 they hit him.

830
00:40:35,875 --> 00:40:37,417
Why did they hit him
a week before?

831
00:40:37,417 --> 00:40:39,042
Because, he hit them
 a week before.

832
00:40:39,042 --> 00:40:40,458
Hey, stop it.

833
00:40:40,458 --> 00:40:41,542
Who hit first?

834
00:40:41,542 --> 00:40:42,458
Brother, why are you asking like this?

835
00:40:42,458 --> 00:40:44,208
We hit them first.
-Is it a pride?

836
00:40:44,208 --> 00:40:46,333
Why did you hit them?
-Brother, why are you asking like a dolt.

837
00:40:46,333 --> 00:40:47,833
What? Am I asking like a dolt?
-Do we remember all these?

838
00:40:47,833 --> 00:40:53,042
The nation is facing many problems,
 fighting for NEET and Ethane.

839
00:40:53,042 --> 00:40:56,292
Being idle, you indulge
 in street fights.

840
00:40:56,292 --> 00:40:57,625
And get thrashed by trespassers.

841
00:40:57,625 --> 00:40:59,167
If asked, you say we're dolts.
-Give a blow on his mouth.

842
00:40:59,167 --> 00:41:01,875
If I see you again in this street,
I'll hit you by the vehicle.

843
00:41:01,875 --> 00:41:03,958
Brother, do we have
 so many problems in our nation?

844
00:41:03,958 --> 00:41:05,375
I'm unaware of it.

845
00:41:05,375 --> 00:41:06,417
What will you do knowing it?

846
00:41:06,417 --> 00:41:08,042
Would have posted
as my status on Facebook.

847
00:41:08,042 --> 00:41:08,875
Facebook!

848
00:41:08,875 --> 00:41:09,958
Today...

849
00:41:09,958 --> 00:41:11,917
Pelt on his head.
-Go and die on your own.

850
00:41:11,917 --> 00:41:14,167
Start the vehicle,
see. what am I going to do?

851
00:41:14,167 --> 00:41:17,042
On the way, Iet's thrust him
 in the 'five falls'. Go fast.

852
00:41:18,542 --> 00:41:21,042
Ashok, he is yet to get ready.

853
00:41:21,292 --> 00:41:24,667
Trusting you, I've promised my brother
 that I'll come to see the bride.

854
00:41:24,667 --> 00:41:26,083
Don’t spoil my honor.

855
00:41:26,083 --> 00:41:29,625
Mom, why do you worry now?
It’s my responsibility to bring him.

856
00:41:29,625 --> 00:41:31,167
Where are you now?

857
00:41:31,167 --> 00:41:32,625
Turn around and see.

858
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:35,833
Where is he?
-Upstairs!

859
00:41:36,833 --> 00:41:39,208
Hey, what are you doing here?

860
00:41:39,208 --> 00:41:41,542
Come, let’s go.
All are waiting for you.

861
00:41:41,542 --> 00:41:42,750
Did I say to wait!

862
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:44,583
I said, I don't want to get married.

863
00:41:45,458 --> 00:41:48,125
Why are you repeatedly asking
 the same and torturing me?

864
00:41:48,125 --> 00:41:49,458
Understand what I say.

865
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:52,333
I'm talking, since I understood.

866
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:54,708
The girl you fell in love,
 got married and left.

867
00:41:55,708 --> 00:41:58,042
That’s over. You've to forget
and move on.

868
00:41:58,333 --> 00:42:01,042
Thinking of it, don’t torture
 the people in the house.

869
00:42:01,042 --> 00:42:03,625
For an hour, two breaking news
are flashed.

870
00:42:03,625 --> 00:42:06,083
But for past two years,
you're thinking of the same incident.

871
00:42:07,083 --> 00:42:09,083
It’s easy to advise others.

872
00:42:09,958 --> 00:42:11,333
You will realize,
 only if you undergo the same.

873
00:42:11,333 --> 00:42:13,417
Should that happen to us?

874
00:42:13,417 --> 00:42:16,250
It will not happen to you.
You need to have a heart.

875
00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:19,167
Oh, what a guy?

876
00:42:19,167 --> 00:42:21,667
You don’t talk about
kind hearted and conscience.

877
00:42:21,667 --> 00:42:24,083
I know the stance,
 how you fixed the bride for me.

878
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:25,917
I shouldn't have pardoned you.
But I did, though.

879
00:42:26,167 --> 00:42:30,083
Now, pleading you
for sake of a good bride.

880
00:42:31,167 --> 00:42:33,167
Who will get a kind hearted friend
like me?

881
00:42:33,167 --> 00:42:34,208
Nobody will get!

882
00:42:34,542 --> 00:42:35,875
At least for this,
Let's go, come on.

883
00:42:35,875 --> 00:42:36,958
Hey, understand.

884
00:42:36,958 --> 00:42:38,042
Hey, I'll not understand.
You leave now.

885
00:42:38,042 --> 00:42:40,208
The family doesn't understand.
At least, you understand me.

886
00:42:40,208 --> 00:42:42,542
Is this your uncle’s house?
Looks like Ram vilas of our town.

887
00:42:42,542 --> 00:42:44,667
Come in!
-Greetings!

888
00:42:44,667 --> 00:42:46,167
Brother!
-Welcome, sister.

889
00:42:46,167 --> 00:42:47,375
Are you doing good?
-I'm doing good.

890
00:42:47,375 --> 00:42:48,750
Sister-in-law, how are you?
-Hope all are fine.

891
00:42:48,750 --> 00:42:50,958
Welcome, bridegroom!
come in.

892
00:42:50,958 --> 00:42:52,667
Hey, children!
sit down.

893
00:42:55,250 --> 00:42:59,375
Now I understand, why did you say
he should marry your brother’s daughter?

894
00:42:59,667 --> 00:43:00,542
Why?

895
00:43:00,708 --> 00:43:04,167
The house looks awesome,
and to take hold of it, right!

896
00:43:04,167 --> 00:43:06,250
Don’t reveal all the secrets!

897
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:07,667
Is it?
-Hey, be quite!

898
00:43:07,667 --> 00:43:08,708
Dad! It's you!

899
00:43:09,083 --> 00:43:12,708
Why are you all silent?
Someone talk.

900
00:43:12,708 --> 00:43:14,333
Sir, I will talk.

901
00:43:14,333 --> 00:43:17,125
We, ourselves shouldn’t say
 proud about Anand.

902
00:43:17,125 --> 00:43:20,167
He has got many proposals.

903
00:43:20,375 --> 00:43:25,750
But, he is stubborn to marry the girl,
 whom his mother likes.

904
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:27,958
Have you seen such
an obedient son, anywhere?

905
00:43:27,958 --> 00:43:29,125
What he said is right!

906
00:43:29,125 --> 00:43:31,208
In this generation, who is getting
married within relationships?

907
00:43:31,208 --> 00:43:35,292
Both brother and sister have
brought up their children well.

908
00:43:35,292 --> 00:43:37,125
Feel proud of them.
-Golden hearted!

909
00:43:37,125 --> 00:43:38,708
He is my eldest son-in-law.
-Welcome!

910
00:43:38,708 --> 00:43:40,375
Greetings!
-You must've seen him in marriage.

911
00:43:40,375 --> 00:43:42,667
He is back from abroad
 a month ago.

912
00:43:42,667 --> 00:43:43,708
Be seated, son-in-law.

913
00:43:45,167 --> 00:43:46,708
Though the bride belongs to our family...

914
00:43:46,708 --> 00:43:49,375
...but, we've to follow our own customs.
ask her to come.

915
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:51,333
Ask Kavya to come.

916
00:43:51,333 --> 00:43:52,667
You go and bring her.

917
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,250
Hey, look at her!

918
00:43:59,250 --> 00:44:00,667
Greet the elders!

919
00:44:01,833 --> 00:44:02,958
Have a look at her!

920
00:44:04,750 --> 00:44:08,708
If new to the family,
we can ask what will you afford?

921
00:44:08,708 --> 00:44:09,917
But, we are relatives.

922
00:44:09,917 --> 00:44:12,625
So, look for an auspicious day
and let's fix the wedding.

923
00:44:12,625 --> 00:44:14,500
Uncle, let’s not hurry!

924
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:15,958
Why, son-in-law?
What happened?

925
00:44:15,958 --> 00:44:18,333
Let’s finalize after checking
 the horoscope.

926
00:44:19,083 --> 00:44:21,542
They have come here,
 after checking the horoscope.

927
00:44:21,542 --> 00:44:23,375
What I'm trying to say is...
-Brother!

928
00:44:23,375 --> 00:44:25,125
You’re the eldest son-in-law.

929
00:44:25,125 --> 00:44:26,958
If you want to say anything,
tell frankly.

930
00:44:26,958 --> 00:44:28,208
Why to restrain?

931
00:44:28,667 --> 00:44:30,042
What's there to hesitate
 among relations?

932
00:44:30,458 --> 00:44:31,042
That’s right!

933
00:44:31,042 --> 00:44:33,750
Who is he?
-Ashok! friend of Anand.

934
00:44:34,167 --> 00:44:36,542
They both are friends
 for past 20 years.

935
00:44:36,542 --> 00:44:39,167
He knows Anand better than I do.

936
00:44:39,167 --> 00:44:40,083
Hello!

937
00:44:40,083 --> 00:44:42,375
I've seen him, somewhere.

938
00:44:42,375 --> 00:44:43,125
Who is this?

939
00:44:43,125 --> 00:44:44,208
Brother, he is from abroad.

940
00:44:44,208 --> 00:44:46,833
That’s why, he came or else
who will have tea in your shop?

941
00:44:47,708 --> 00:44:50,208
Please, don’t mistake me
for saying this.

942
00:44:50,208 --> 00:44:53,125
If we get a proposal from strangers,
we won't be sure of their family stance.

943
00:44:53,125 --> 00:44:55,125
That's why, we prefer to get married
 within the relationships.

944
00:44:55,125 --> 00:44:58,125
I heard wrong about Anand.

945
00:44:58,292 --> 00:44:59,708
What's that you heard wrong?

946
00:45:01,042 --> 00:45:03,708
Who said wrong about my son?

947
00:45:04,417 --> 00:45:06,833
He plays kabaddi
and my brother is aware of it.

948
00:45:06,833 --> 00:45:10,750
People will gossip, we shouldn’t bother
 as we are kith and kin.

949
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:12,875
I wouldn’t have believed
if someone has told me.

950
00:45:12,875 --> 00:45:15,208
When said by groom’s
 long time friend Ashok,

951
00:45:15,208 --> 00:45:16,417
How can I not believe it?

952
00:45:22,167 --> 00:45:22,667
Sir!

953
00:45:23,667 --> 00:45:27,208
Sir! I said it for fun,
why are you taking it, seriously?

954
00:45:27,208 --> 00:45:29,250
Do you mean what you said
was for fun?

955
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:31,083
I don’t want to say in this forum.

956
00:45:32,708 --> 00:45:33,875
What did I say?

957
00:45:33,875 --> 00:45:35,500
Bhai, Anand is a big accused.

958
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:39,500
His only good habit is his friendship
with me and my only bad habit is him.

959
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:42,292
Because of him, how many
arguments and cases!

960
00:45:42,292 --> 00:45:44,333
He has to be arrested
in Goondas act.

961
00:45:44,333 --> 00:45:45,375
You don’t believe, right!
-No!

962
00:45:45,375 --> 00:45:46,667
Brother, tell about Anand!

963
00:45:46,667 --> 00:45:49,417
Brother, why to talk about him
when going for a good deed?

964
00:45:49,417 --> 00:45:52,500
He is a rogue, my daughter's life
was ruined because of him.

965
00:45:53,208 --> 00:45:55,083
My family was shattered.

966
00:45:55,917 --> 00:45:57,917
Feel ashamed to go out.

967
00:45:59,042 --> 00:46:00,458
I curse him.

968
00:46:00,458 --> 00:46:01,583
Enough, you are busy.
Go to work.

969
00:46:01,583 --> 00:46:04,958
What he said is nothing.
Still, there are many.

970
00:46:04,958 --> 00:46:07,917
He is clever,
that’s why, he accompanies me, always.

971
00:46:07,917 --> 00:46:11,417
All my positive things
 are hiding his negatives.

972
00:46:11,417 --> 00:46:15,583
Bhai, in spite of it, one day
 his real identity will be revealed.

973
00:46:15,583 --> 00:46:18,583
He will get exposed, confirmedly.

974
00:46:18,583 --> 00:46:20,542
Mom, he didn't lie.

975
00:46:20,542 --> 00:46:24,375
Uncle, our girl's life is
important for us.

976
00:46:24,375 --> 00:46:25,875
Think well and decide.

977
00:46:37,958 --> 00:46:41,667
Is he a friend to you?
You've good habituals.

978
00:46:41,667 --> 00:46:43,833
We were humiliated before everyone.

979
00:46:43,833 --> 00:46:46,667
I curse him, he will be doomed
who ruined my son's life.

980
00:46:46,667 --> 00:46:49,875
Mom, be quite.
Why cursing him!

981
00:46:49,875 --> 00:46:53,208
Did he do, deliberately?
Just leave it.

982
00:46:53,583 --> 00:46:55,000
Keep on saying the same.

983
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,083
Have some water.

984
00:46:56,083 --> 00:46:57,708
Why to have water?
-staring too?

985
00:47:00,333 --> 00:47:04,792
This is why, I told you many times
 not to be playful in everything.

986
00:47:04,792 --> 00:47:08,167
I know, where will you be playful
and seroius.

987
00:47:08,167 --> 00:47:09,750
But, will these people know?

988
00:47:10,292 --> 00:47:13,958
What you did for fun
made to deny him a bride.

989
00:47:13,958 --> 00:47:14,833
What are you going
 to do now?

990
00:47:18,458 --> 00:47:19,375
Nothing!

991
00:47:21,042 --> 00:47:22,792
Hey, Ashok!

992
00:47:25,125 --> 00:47:26,583
Did you see the film,
 'Nerkonda Paarvai'?

993
00:47:26,583 --> 00:47:27,750
Yes, I've watched it.
Very nice.

994
00:47:28,750 --> 00:47:30,417
'Thala' has acted well.

995
00:47:30,417 --> 00:47:30,958
Tomorrow…

996
00:47:30,958 --> 00:47:32,125
Priya, you go.
I will come.

997
00:47:32,125 --> 00:47:33,458
Hey, where are you going?
-You go, I'll come and tell you.

998
00:47:33,458 --> 00:47:34,167
Okay!

999
00:47:36,125 --> 00:47:38,458
What's the matter?
Why are you waiting?

1000
00:47:38,458 --> 00:47:42,083
Anand is not a bad guy,
like you people think.

1001
00:47:42,083 --> 00:47:44,417
They didn't think bad of Anand.

1002
00:47:44,417 --> 00:47:46,750
The words you told about him,
made them to think bad.

1003
00:47:46,750 --> 00:47:48,333
That's my fault.

1004
00:47:48,333 --> 00:47:51,375
I never thought, it'll become so serious,
 which I said just for fun.

1005
00:47:51,375 --> 00:47:52,417
Is it a fun?

1006
00:47:52,417 --> 00:47:53,833
For sake of fun,
 will you speak like this?

1007
00:47:53,833 --> 00:47:56,125
We will talk worst than this.

1008
00:47:56,125 --> 00:47:59,042
How do I know, that your uncle
will listen it and convey your father?

1009
00:47:59,042 --> 00:48:00,500
Okay, you said for fun.

1010
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:02,500
Even a person has said
 that his daughter's life...

1011
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:04,375
...was ruined because of Anand.

1012
00:48:04,375 --> 00:48:06,500
Twister, he has said everything!

1013
00:48:07,042 --> 00:48:09,292
His daughter fell in love,

1014
00:48:09,292 --> 00:48:11,375
Anand helped her
 and got them married .

1015
00:48:11,375 --> 00:48:14,000
He doesn't like that,
So, speaks bad about Anand.

1016
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:20,542
To say the fact, she is living happily now
 than before.

1017
00:48:20,542 --> 00:48:21,458
Ohh!

1018
00:48:21,458 --> 00:48:25,583
If you get married to Anand,
you too will live happily.

1019
00:48:26,833 --> 00:48:29,667
He is a good guy
and doesn’t have any bad habits.

1020
00:48:29,667 --> 00:48:32,917
If I want to help someone,
 I'll think a lot and do.

1021
00:48:32,917 --> 00:48:35,042
But, he will help without thinking.

1022
00:48:35,042 --> 00:48:38,667
The other day, he raised his hand
since someone spoke bad about me.

1023
00:48:38,667 --> 00:48:41,333
Your uncle has complained that.

1024
00:48:41,333 --> 00:48:45,250
If his life gets ruined,
because of me...

1025
00:48:45,250 --> 00:48:46,750
It'll be a guilt all through my life.

1026
00:48:47,917 --> 00:48:50,083
You will not get
a better person than him.

1027
00:48:50,083 --> 00:48:51,375
Think and take a good decision.

1028
00:48:53,417 --> 00:48:54,750
Okay, I'll leave.

1029
00:49:00,333 --> 00:49:02,792
Robo Shankar to receive Oscar award.

1030
00:49:02,792 --> 00:49:07,417
(Indistinct chatters)

1031
00:49:07,417 --> 00:49:09,625
Hey, what happened?

1032
00:49:09,625 --> 00:49:10,917
Ashok has come.

1033
00:49:10,917 --> 00:49:11,583
Ashok!

1034
00:49:11,583 --> 00:49:12,750
We were talking about you.

1035
00:49:12,750 --> 00:49:13,667
Filthy?

1036
00:49:13,667 --> 00:49:14,958
Talking about me?
-Yes!

1037
00:49:14,958 --> 00:49:16,417
Bhai, then I'll leave.
I have work.

1038
00:49:16,417 --> 00:49:19,458
Hey, you've done enough.
Come and sit down.

1039
00:49:19,458 --> 00:49:20,958
Without putting the stand
he will not come.

1040
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:21,750
Have the tea!

1041
00:49:23,667 --> 00:49:26,000
Ashok, instead of telling lies
 and getting your friend married...

1042
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,417
...you spoke the truth
and saved a girl’s life.

1043
00:49:28,417 --> 00:49:29,208
I like you!

1044
00:49:29,208 --> 00:49:30,500
Not like that, bhai!

1045
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:31,917
He is a very good guy,

1046
00:49:31,917 --> 00:49:33,167
I just said for fun. But...

1047
00:49:33,167 --> 00:49:34,292
What are you saying?

1048
00:49:34,292 --> 00:49:35,917
Because you said,
even I've conveyed to few people.

1049
00:49:35,917 --> 00:49:37,250
Bhai, why have you said like this?

1050
00:49:37,250 --> 00:49:39,917
Better, write it in a slate
and hang it in front.

1051
00:49:39,917 --> 00:49:42,208
Bhai, for taking revenge,
 Ashok is the best.

1052
00:49:42,208 --> 00:49:44,792
No one is better than him
in the surroundings.

1053
00:49:44,792 --> 00:49:45,500
Yeah, right!
-Is it?

1054
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:48,750
He does it so perfectly,
even for his friend.

1055
00:49:48,750 --> 00:49:51,000
Hey, bottle!
when did I avenge.

1056
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,917
Hey, what do you mean
for what you have done?

1057
00:49:53,917 --> 00:49:56,417
Since, they were going to get marry
the girl, whom you don’t like...

1058
00:49:56,417 --> 00:49:58,875
...You made that none of the girls
should like him.

1059
00:49:58,875 --> 00:50:00,542
Excellent plan!
He had done it, perfectly.

1060
00:50:00,542 --> 00:50:01,625
Hey, don’t spill the coffee.

1061
00:50:01,625 --> 00:50:04,583
Hey, when that happened?
And when this happened?

1062
00:50:04,583 --> 00:50:06,208
Don’t spread unwanted
defamation on me!

1063
00:50:06,208 --> 00:50:07,542
What defamation
are we spreading on you?

1064
00:50:07,542 --> 00:50:10,167
Are you spreading on him
or it's we spreading on you?

1065
00:50:10,167 --> 00:50:11,333
What body language is this?

1066
00:50:11,333 --> 00:50:12,458
Defamation!

1067
00:50:12,458 --> 00:50:14,500
Since morning, you are pulling his legs.
 leave him.

1068
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:17,292
Anand, you are kind hearted,
 you will forgive.

1069
00:50:17,292 --> 00:50:20,417
I wasn’t willing to see the bride,
since he said, I went.

1070
00:50:21,333 --> 00:50:22,208
A new story!

1071
00:50:22,208 --> 00:50:24,292
But, it was halted because of him.

1072
00:50:24,292 --> 00:50:26,292
I'm not angry on you in any way.

1073
00:50:26,292 --> 00:50:29,292
But, uncle and Kavya
will think bad of me.

1074
00:50:29,292 --> 00:50:32,208
Already, the relatives started
 to badmouth.

1075
00:50:32,208 --> 00:50:35,708
Now, I couldn't face anyone.
That's right!

1076
00:50:35,708 --> 00:50:39,875
When people with us speak badly
about me, what to ask others?

1077
00:50:39,875 --> 00:50:41,875
Hey, look at him!
He got angry!

1078
00:50:41,875 --> 00:50:44,375
Getting anger!
-Hey, why are you going?

1079
00:50:44,375 --> 00:50:46,542
Hey, it's me who should
get angry and leave.

1080
00:50:46,542 --> 00:50:48,458
Instead, you're getting angry
and leaving.

1081
00:50:48,458 --> 00:50:49,208
Ashok!

1082
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:52,708
Why did you spill my coffee,
since he left?

1083
00:50:52,708 --> 00:50:54,292
Then, if you drink
 without buying me?

1084
00:50:54,292 --> 00:50:55,542
Is tomorrow a holiday!
-Yes!

1085
00:51:00,250 --> 00:51:01,833
Hey, what's the celebrations upto?

1086
00:51:01,833 --> 00:51:03,708
He is your beau Anand, right?
-Yes!

1087
00:51:03,708 --> 00:51:05,417
To whom is the banner?
-For me.

1088
00:51:05,417 --> 00:51:07,375
Who is the child in the banner?
-It's me.

1089
00:51:07,375 --> 00:51:09,833
Hey, he is very smart.

1090
00:51:09,833 --> 00:51:13,083
You know that it's you,
but others doesn't know.

1091
00:51:13,083 --> 00:51:17,208
Happy birthday to you!
Happy birthday!

1092
00:51:17,208 --> 00:51:25,958
Happy birthday!

1093
00:51:25,958 --> 00:51:28,917
Brother is waiting
 for you, inside.

1094
00:51:30,083 --> 00:51:32,708
Happy birthday to you!

1095
00:51:33,333 --> 00:51:34,625
Excuse me!

1096
00:51:36,792 --> 00:51:39,208
Birthday wishes!
-Thank you.

1097
00:51:40,542 --> 00:51:41,833
This is for you.
-Why all these?

1098
00:51:41,833 --> 00:51:44,583
Anand told to give this to you.
-What's this?

1099
00:51:44,583 --> 00:51:46,292
How do I know?

1100
00:51:46,292 --> 00:51:48,500
You open it and see,
 he has bought for you.

1101
00:51:49,583 --> 00:51:51,583
Why did he buy a gold chain?
-To show his love.

1102
00:51:51,583 --> 00:51:53,292
Okay, Why are you bringing this?

1103
00:51:53,292 --> 00:51:54,708
Didn't Anand come?

1104
00:51:54,708 --> 00:51:56,917
How will he come?
Won't he feel embrassing?

1105
00:51:56,917 --> 00:52:00,833
Everyday, he is regretting for
what has happened.

1106
00:52:00,833 --> 00:52:03,500
The day you understand him
 and come for him...

1107
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:05,583
...On that day, he will face you.

1108
00:52:05,583 --> 00:52:07,792
Kavya, I should tell this to you.

1109
00:52:07,792 --> 00:52:10,667
I too thought that ocean is big
and sky is high.

1110
00:52:10,667 --> 00:52:13,958
But before Anand's love,
this is nothing.

1111
00:52:13,958 --> 00:52:18,250
He called last night at 3 o'clock
and told me a poetry and slept.

1112
00:52:18,250 --> 00:52:20,375
But I couldn't sleep, thereafter.

1113
00:52:20,375 --> 00:52:21,833
I was shivering!

1114
00:52:21,833 --> 00:52:23,000
What’s great about the poetry!

1115
00:52:24,375 --> 00:52:26,625
Because of shivering, I forgot.

1116
00:52:26,625 --> 00:52:28,250
I'll send you by WhatsApp.

1117
00:52:28,250 --> 00:52:32,833
I'll not forget the impact
 created by the poetry, till my death.

1118
00:52:32,833 --> 00:52:34,583
What's the use of
doing all these?

1119
00:52:34,583 --> 00:52:36,292
Who will speak to your father?

1120
00:52:37,708 --> 00:52:38,708
You have to talk.

1121
00:52:38,708 --> 00:52:39,375
Me!

1122
00:52:39,375 --> 00:52:40,833
Who else, will 'Solomon Pappaiah'
speak for you?

1123
00:52:40,833 --> 00:52:42,167
Yes! You have to talk.

1124
00:52:43,042 --> 00:52:46,167
With great difficulty
he has written the poetry for you.

1125
00:52:46,167 --> 00:52:49,417
I'll try to speak to my dad.
I'll call you after speaking.

1126
00:52:49,417 --> 00:52:50,000
Okay!

1127
00:52:50,917 --> 00:52:52,000
Just a minute!

1128
00:52:55,042 --> 00:52:56,542
I'm not ashamed to tell you this.

1129
00:52:56,542 --> 00:52:57,625
Not ashamed?

1130
00:52:58,375 --> 00:53:00,667
I don't wish to fall in love
in my life.

1131
00:53:00,667 --> 00:53:03,875
Infact, not desired of even getting married.

1132
00:53:03,875 --> 00:53:06,292
But, when looking the way
Anand loves you,

1133
00:53:06,292 --> 00:53:08,375
I wish to have a
 love marriage.

1134
00:53:08,375 --> 00:53:11,250
I swear, if I would've born
as a girl...

1135
00:53:11,250 --> 00:53:13,125
...I would've envied on you.

1136
00:53:13,833 --> 00:53:14,833
What to do?

1137
00:53:14,833 --> 00:53:16,375
Since, born as a male,
 I got spoilt.

1138
00:53:16,375 --> 00:53:17,167
Okay, I'll leave.

1139
00:53:17,167 --> 00:53:18,708
Check out, your attire
 is getting dirty.

1140
00:53:21,292 --> 00:53:23,375
He must've worked at
Madurai Chintamani theatre.

1141
00:53:23,375 --> 00:53:25,458
The chain is going upto
Karaikudi bus depot.

1142
00:53:27,250 --> 00:53:29,208
Hey, don't drink more water.
-Then, what is that?

1143
00:53:29,208 --> 00:53:32,042
It'll be overload and
lead to kidney failure.

1144
00:53:32,042 --> 00:53:36,042
Why do you ask us to work hard,
if kidney failure occurs?

1145
00:53:36,042 --> 00:53:38,000
Hey, it's true.
 it's in WhatsApp!

1146
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,875
How so soon
 it came in WhatsApp?

1147
00:53:39,875 --> 00:53:40,792
Show me!

1148
00:53:40,792 --> 00:53:42,542
Where is your phone?
-It's here.

1149
00:53:42,542 --> 00:53:45,375
In this phone, you received
by WhatsApp!

1150
00:53:45,375 --> 00:53:47,500
I'll listen if you say
to drink less,

1151
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:49,375
...since water is expensive.
But you act, smartly.

1152
00:53:49,375 --> 00:53:51,500
Where are you going?
-I'm going to piss!

1153
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:52,708
Hey, better piss less!

1154
00:53:55,375 --> 00:53:57,125
Why didn’t you go?
-No, I'll go next week.

1155
00:53:57,125 --> 00:53:59,167
Take care,
salt crystals might form.

1156
00:54:07,375 --> 00:54:07,958
K!

1157
00:54:09,167 --> 00:54:10,208
Who is this K?

1158
00:54:12,458 --> 00:54:14,042
Personal!

1159
00:54:14,042 --> 00:54:15,792
What's that your personal
 without my knowledge?

1160
00:54:15,792 --> 00:54:17,458
I can't keep telling you, everything.

1161
00:54:17,458 --> 00:54:18,958
It's personal!

1162
00:54:18,958 --> 00:54:19,958
What personal?

1163
00:54:19,958 --> 00:54:20,917
Hello, sir! where are you?

1164
00:54:20,917 --> 00:54:22,125
By tonight,
you'll blabber everything.

1165
00:54:25,583 --> 00:54:26,708
Did you speak to your father?

1166
00:54:26,708 --> 00:54:29,667
Thought of talking to dad,
when he is in good mood.

1167
00:54:29,667 --> 00:54:31,750
By then, marriage has been fixed.

1168
00:54:33,583 --> 00:54:35,500
Within a week?
-Yes!

1169
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:37,000
Who is the bridegroom?
From which place?

1170
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:37,708
From Ramanathapuram.

1171
00:54:37,708 --> 00:54:39,375
Have you spoke
 to the bridegroom?

1172
00:54:39,375 --> 00:54:40,333
No.

1173
00:54:40,333 --> 00:54:43,500
Do you know him before?
-I don't know.

1174
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:45,083
Do you know
 where is Ramanathapuram?

1175
00:54:45,083 --> 00:54:47,083
They said, it's three hours journey,
from here.

1176
00:54:47,083 --> 00:54:47,917
Three hours?

1177
00:54:48,542 --> 00:54:50,542
From your house to Anand's house
it's just three minutes.

1178
00:54:50,542 --> 00:54:53,625
If any problem arises,
how will you come from Ramanathapuram?

1179
00:54:54,750 --> 00:54:57,625
If it's Anand, you know him
 from childhood and your relative too.

1180
00:54:57,625 --> 00:55:00,583
And he is from this town.
 If any ruckus arises...

1181
00:55:00,583 --> 00:55:01,292
It will not!

1182
00:55:01,292 --> 00:55:04,750
If it happens, then you can walk
 to your house in three minutes.

1183
00:55:04,750 --> 00:55:06,083
You have many advantages.

1184
00:55:06,083 --> 00:55:07,875
In our life, we should decide...

1185
00:55:07,875 --> 00:55:10,958
...what job we should do and
whom should we live with?

1186
00:55:10,958 --> 00:55:13,167
Don’t nod your head
since dad or granny said.

1187
00:55:13,167 --> 00:55:17,792
Why do people respect me
 and listen to me?

1188
00:55:17,792 --> 00:55:19,208
Because, I haven’t obeyed my father.

1189
00:55:19,208 --> 00:55:19,958
That's why.

1190
00:55:19,958 --> 00:55:21,708
I'm telling you the same, Kavya.

1191
00:55:22,542 --> 00:55:25,333
Whoever advise you
or even if I say...

1192
00:55:25,333 --> 00:55:29,000
Think well and decide
what is good for you.

1193
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,833
This is the purpose of education
and going to college and all.

1194
00:55:30,833 --> 00:55:34,667
For that, I am not asking you
 to be a revolutionary like, Dr. Muthulakshmi.

1195
00:55:34,667 --> 00:55:37,458
You decide your life,
that's a big revolution!

1196
00:55:38,750 --> 00:55:41,292
Can I tell you everything?
I can only show you the way.

1197
00:55:42,708 --> 00:55:43,958
What is this?
-Invitation!

1198
00:55:44,917 --> 00:55:46,333
Have they printed the invitation?

1199
00:55:47,208 --> 00:55:49,667
Hey, you must've shown this first.

1200
00:55:49,667 --> 00:55:51,583
I wouldn't have spoken so long.

1201
00:55:51,583 --> 00:55:55,500
You are speaking continuously
 and it was interesting...

1202
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:57,583
...that's why, I was waiting
not to interrupt you.

1203
00:55:59,417 --> 00:56:01,875
I haven't written your name in that.
-Is it very important?

1204
00:56:01,875 --> 00:56:03,708
Give it to someone
who comes to eat.

1205
00:56:09,083 --> 00:56:11,417
What to tell?

1206
00:56:11,417 --> 00:56:13,708
Getting arranged marriage.

1207
00:56:17,375 --> 00:56:22,083
Writing the accounts everyday,
hurts my hand.

1208
00:56:24,875 --> 00:56:30,542
Hey, a bridegroom has been fixed
 for my uncle's daughter.

1209
00:56:30,542 --> 00:56:32,583
Coming friday is the wedding.

1210
00:56:32,583 --> 00:56:33,458
I know!

1211
00:56:33,458 --> 00:56:33,958
Know it?

1212
00:56:33,958 --> 00:56:34,875
How do you know?
-Write it in his account.

1213
00:56:34,875 --> 00:56:36,167
Okay, brother.

1214
00:56:36,167 --> 00:56:37,375
The whole town knows.

1215
00:56:37,375 --> 00:56:38,083
That’s right!

1216
00:56:38,083 --> 00:56:41,083
I'll not come to office for two days,
 have lot of wedding work.

1217
00:56:41,083 --> 00:56:42,125
Take care of the office.

1218
00:56:42,125 --> 00:56:43,792
Hey, aren't you ashamed?

1219
00:56:44,250 --> 00:56:47,125
They refused you the bride,
then why do you go?

1220
00:56:47,125 --> 00:56:49,667
Will he be forbidden from being my uncle,
since he didn’t give his daughter.

1221
00:56:49,667 --> 00:56:50,708
Dude, what?

1222
00:56:51,917 --> 00:56:53,417
Okay, listen!

1223
00:56:53,417 --> 00:56:55,875
Coming friday, my house is
being auctioned…

1224
00:56:55,875 --> 00:56:58,500
…I am going to Madurai
 to pay the money.

1225
00:56:58,500 --> 00:56:59,667
So, you take care of the office.

1226
00:56:59,667 --> 00:57:01,167
Better, let's declare holiday for office.

1227
00:57:02,375 --> 00:57:05,167
The wedding is not so important
 to declare a holiday.

1228
00:57:05,167 --> 00:57:06,500
We will declare for your wedding.

1229
00:57:07,250 --> 00:57:08,250
Okay, leave that.

1230
00:57:08,250 --> 00:57:11,083
For the auction, have you arranged
the money or shall I arrange?

1231
00:57:11,083 --> 00:57:12,958
Dad has arranged the money.

1232
00:57:12,958 --> 00:57:15,500
I have to pay the money
and get the documents.

1233
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:16,250
Okay.

1234
00:57:16,250 --> 00:57:18,375
This was from Ramesh agency,
Check it.

1235
00:57:18,375 --> 00:57:19,208
Finally, he gave it.

1236
00:57:19,208 --> 00:57:20,792
I thought of banging him
 and get the money.

1237
00:57:20,792 --> 00:57:21,958
Good, he escaped.

1238
00:57:24,250 --> 00:57:26,083
Is it a must to attend
 the wedding?

1239
00:57:26,083 --> 00:57:27,292
You said not to go.

1240
00:57:39,833 --> 00:57:40,417
Hello!

1241
00:57:40,417 --> 00:57:42,208
Ashok, I'm Kavya!

1242
00:57:42,667 --> 00:57:45,250
Hey, why are you calling late night?

1243
00:57:45,250 --> 00:57:47,208
An important message.

1244
00:57:48,292 --> 00:57:49,250
What's that important message?

1245
00:57:50,042 --> 00:57:51,833
Today is your wedding, right?

1246
00:57:51,833 --> 00:57:54,542
Yes, I am confused.

1247
00:57:54,542 --> 00:57:57,375
I need to talk to you.
Can you come home?

1248
00:58:01,167 --> 00:58:02,083
Now?

1249
00:58:02,083 --> 00:58:02,917
Yes, now.

1250
00:58:02,917 --> 00:58:04,125
Will you come soon, please?

1251
00:58:04,125 --> 00:58:06,083
Should I come now, definitely?
-Yes!

1252
00:58:06,083 --> 00:58:07,500
Only you can help me.

1253
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:08,833
Come, please.

1254
00:58:08,833 --> 00:58:09,542
Okay, I will come.

1255
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:18,958
Dad!

1256
00:58:18,958 --> 00:58:21,000
Hey, where did Ashok go?

1257
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,292
He isn't attending the call.

1258
00:58:22,292 --> 00:58:23,292
Why?
what happened, dad?

1259
00:58:23,292 --> 00:58:26,042
The house will be auctioned,
 need to pay money at the bank.

1260
00:58:26,042 --> 00:58:27,625
I'm held up in auditing.

1261
00:58:27,625 --> 00:58:30,208
I trusted him.
 But, as usual he betrayed me.

1262
00:58:30,208 --> 00:58:33,583
I too called him,
he didn’t attend.

1263
00:58:33,583 --> 00:58:35,958
Dad, don’t worry.
I'll pay the money at bank.

1264
00:58:35,958 --> 00:58:38,250
We will check with him,
once he is back.

1265
00:58:38,250 --> 00:58:39,917
Okay, go home and get the
money from mom.

1266
00:58:39,917 --> 00:58:41,500
Ensure to pay the money
by 10 to 10.15 AM…

1267
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:42,792
…or else house will be
auctioned. Okay?

1268
00:58:42,792 --> 00:58:44,167
Dad, you don’t get tensed.

1269
00:58:44,167 --> 00:58:45,500
I will pay the money
and get the documents.

1270
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:46,958
Okay.

1271
00:58:56,083 --> 00:58:57,917
Kavya! what happened?

1272
00:58:57,917 --> 00:59:00,500
I’m not interested in this marriage.

1273
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:02,625
Hey, you're saying it in the last minute!

1274
00:59:02,625 --> 00:59:03,833
Till yesterday, what where you doing?

1275
00:59:04,250 --> 00:59:05,375
I was thinking!

1276
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:06,500
Thinking?

1277
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:07,833
Then, tell your parents.

1278
00:59:07,833 --> 00:59:09,542
If I can tell them,
why should I call you?

1279
00:59:10,208 --> 00:59:11,042
What to do, now?

1280
00:59:11,750 --> 00:59:14,292
I don’t know, but I don’t want
 this marriage to happen.

1281
00:59:18,917 --> 00:59:20,042
Will you marry Anand?

1282
00:59:23,375 --> 00:59:24,583
Hey, think well and tell me.

1283
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:27,958
Have you decided?

1284
00:59:27,958 --> 00:59:28,875
Okay, then come.
 let’s go.

1285
00:59:28,875 --> 00:59:30,667
Wedding is about to happen.
How to come?

1286
00:59:30,667 --> 00:59:32,167
Then, finish the wedding and come.

1287
00:59:32,167 --> 00:59:33,333
Not that!

1288
00:59:33,333 --> 00:59:36,458
If my dad knows I was eloped,
he'll feel humiliated.

1289
00:59:36,458 --> 00:59:37,375
I am thinking about it.

1290
00:59:38,750 --> 00:59:42,333
The wedding has to be stopped,
and it shouldn't be like you've eloped.

1291
00:59:42,333 --> 00:59:43,625
Let's do one thing.

1292
00:59:43,625 --> 00:59:45,542
It'll be a humiliation to your dad,
 if you're eloped.

1293
00:59:45,542 --> 00:59:47,167
I will abduct you
and get you married to Anand.

1294
00:59:48,042 --> 00:59:49,000
I can’t lift you.

1295
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,542
I’ll take you along
and get you married.

1296
00:59:50,542 --> 00:59:51,083
Come on!

1297
00:59:51,083 --> 00:59:52,500
Wonder, what's going to happen!

1298
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:54,042
Aunty, how are you?

1299
00:59:54,042 --> 00:59:55,000
Keep it in the ear.

1300
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,000
Go...
-You naughty!

1301
00:59:56,375 --> 00:59:58,917
Who is he?
Will he be the groom's relative?

1302
00:59:58,917 --> 01:00:00,250
Be careful!
Make sure no one notices you.

1303
01:00:02,333 --> 01:00:03,375
Hey, that’s a cupboard.

1304
01:00:03,375 --> 01:00:04,417
Why they've blocked the passage?

1305
01:00:04,417 --> 01:00:05,625
Go this way.
-Oh, I went the wrong way!

1306
01:00:08,208 --> 01:00:09,167
Hey, who are you?

1307
01:00:09,167 --> 01:00:10,250
I don't know, ask her.

1308
01:00:10,250 --> 01:00:11,000
Who is he?

1309
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:11,625
I don’t know!

1310
01:00:11,625 --> 01:00:13,000
Then, why do you go with him?

1311
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:13,833
He is hauling me.

1312
01:00:13,833 --> 01:00:14,375
Hey, who are you?

1313
01:00:14,375 --> 01:00:15,208
Who are you?

1314
01:00:15,208 --> 01:00:16,000
I'm bridegroom’s brother!

1315
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
Hey, I was searching for you.

1316
01:00:19,875 --> 01:00:20,708
Why did you hit him?

1317
01:00:21,583 --> 01:00:23,958
If I hit him, It'll be like
 I'm hauling you.

1318
01:00:23,958 --> 01:00:25,250
Else, it will reflect like
you're eloping with me.

1319
01:00:25,250 --> 01:00:25,792
Come on.

1320
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:33,167
Come on.

1321
01:00:33,167 --> 01:00:34,750
Hey, where are you taking the girl?

1322
01:00:34,750 --> 01:00:35,583
Who are you?

1323
01:00:36,125 --> 01:00:37,708
Hey, where are you taking her?

1324
01:00:37,708 --> 01:00:38,958
Hey, someone is fleeing
 with our girl.

1325
01:00:38,958 --> 01:00:39,583
Catch him.

1326
01:00:39,583 --> 01:00:42,125
Hey, come.
-Go fast.

1327
01:00:42,125 --> 01:00:44,542
Don’t allow them to escape.

1328
01:00:44,542 --> 01:00:46,208
Don’t leave them.
Hey, stop.

1329
01:00:46,208 --> 01:00:47,458
Oh, no!
Hey, start the vehicle.

1330
01:00:47,458 --> 01:00:49,000
Go fast!

1331
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:49,750
Faster!

1332
01:00:49,750 --> 01:00:50,417
Start the vehicle.

1333
01:00:50,417 --> 01:00:51,500
Get in.

1334
01:00:51,875 --> 01:00:52,833
Go fast

1335
01:00:52,833 --> 01:00:54,750
Hey, go faster!
Don’t leave him.

1336
01:00:54,750 --> 01:00:55,458
Go fast.

1337
01:01:15,917 --> 01:01:19,167
I am scared, get back me
to home, please.

1338
01:01:19,875 --> 01:01:22,833
What? do you want
to get back to home?

1339
01:01:22,833 --> 01:01:25,208
Will you keep
changing your decisions?

1340
01:01:25,208 --> 01:01:26,167
No, looking all these, I'm scared.

1341
01:01:26,167 --> 01:01:27,208
Scared?

1342
01:01:27,208 --> 01:01:28,833
Okay, I'll leave you in your home.

1343
01:01:28,833 --> 01:01:31,042
Will you marry that wastrel?

1344
01:01:31,042 --> 01:01:31,667
No!

1345
01:01:32,250 --> 01:01:34,667
No decision can be made
by relying on these girls.

1346
01:01:48,125 --> 01:01:49,042
It’s over!

1347
01:02:04,083 --> 01:02:06,542
Hey, go fast and smash him.

1348
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,125
Hey, wait!

1349
01:02:16,125 --> 01:02:17,250
Where are you leaving, urgently?

1350
01:02:17,625 --> 01:02:18,875
Hey, what?

1351
01:02:18,875 --> 01:02:20,667
Why Ashok did like this?

1352
01:02:20,667 --> 01:02:21,250
What he did?

1353
01:02:21,250 --> 01:02:23,042
He halted your uncle’s daughter marriage
 and eloped with her.

1354
01:02:23,042 --> 01:02:24,083
Why are you blabbering?

1355
01:02:24,083 --> 01:02:25,000
He will not do it.

1356
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:26,083
Who is blabbering!

1357
01:02:26,083 --> 01:02:28,417
The whole town is chasing him.
The local channel is telecasting it 'LIVE'.

1358
01:02:28,417 --> 01:02:29,208
If you don’t believe,
call and ask him.

1359
01:02:32,208 --> 01:02:33,458
Google, call Anand!

1360
01:02:33,958 --> 01:02:36,083
I'm telling you, he has eloped with her,
 you're picking up the phone, very casually.

1361
01:02:36,833 --> 01:02:38,292
Hey, wait.
 He’s calling me.

1362
01:02:38,292 --> 01:02:39,417
Hey, where are you?

1363
01:02:39,417 --> 01:02:41,042
Is my uncle’s daughter with you?

1364
01:02:41,042 --> 01:02:42,292
Yes, she is with me.

1365
01:02:42,292 --> 01:02:45,375
You buy a garland and mangalsutra
and come to Athangudi Murugan temple, immediately.

1366
01:02:45,375 --> 01:02:47,583
Hey, why are you saying now?
Can't you tell me, earlier?

1367
01:02:47,583 --> 01:02:50,417
She told me only today morning.
Then, how can I tell you before?

1368
01:02:50,417 --> 01:02:52,000
Hey, you buy the garland
and mangalsutra and come soon.

1369
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,375
Hey, dad has asked me to
pay the money at bank.

1370
01:02:54,375 --> 01:02:56,167
You take your time,
 pay the money and come.

1371
01:02:56,167 --> 01:02:58,667
By that time,
they will dump me in a coffin.

1372
01:02:58,667 --> 01:03:02,042
Hey, come soon.
I'm being chased.

1373
01:03:02,708 --> 01:03:03,542
What did he say?

1374
01:03:04,250 --> 01:03:05,708
Asked to buy a garland
 and mangalsutra and come soon.

1375
01:03:05,708 --> 01:03:09,333
Great! he abducted your uncle’s daughter
 and made you a middleman.

1376
01:03:09,333 --> 01:03:10,875
Dangerous stance,
what can I do?

1377
01:03:10,875 --> 01:03:12,250
Shut up and hop on the bike.

1378
01:03:12,917 --> 01:03:13,500
Where?

1379
01:03:13,792 --> 01:03:16,000
I’m not coming.
Don’t indulge me in fight.

1380
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,208
Then, the problem will be intense.

1381
01:03:17,750 --> 01:03:18,542
Hey, there he comes!

1382
01:03:18,542 --> 01:03:19,250
Go, stop him!

1383
01:03:19,250 --> 01:03:20,250
Go!

1384
01:03:28,667 --> 01:03:32,333
Anand, I had a doubt , when he said
 the phone call was personal.

1385
01:04:12,375 --> 01:04:15,167
Now, why are you going around
the temple?

1386
01:04:15,167 --> 01:04:17,708
For all the sin I did.

1387
01:04:17,708 --> 01:04:21,792
I've asked Anand to come here,
Till he arrives, I've to go around.

1388
01:04:21,792 --> 01:04:24,042
Don't your relatives have sense?

1389
01:04:24,042 --> 01:04:26,792
Since, I'm going around the temple,
they are also following me.

1390
01:04:26,792 --> 01:04:28,083
Stupid guys!

1391
01:04:28,083 --> 01:04:29,375
Not dare enough to come front
and catch me.

1392
01:04:29,583 --> 01:04:30,958
Oh, my goddess!

1393
01:04:38,167 --> 01:04:39,000
No, uncle!

1394
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:43,458
Uncle, I came to see around
the temple.

1395
01:04:43,458 --> 01:04:45,042
Don’t hit me.

1396
01:04:45,042 --> 01:04:46,167
Fast!

1397
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:48,000
Go away!

1398
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:03,875
Too much of dust!

1399
01:05:06,583 --> 01:05:08,250
Hey, excellent!

1400
01:05:09,875 --> 01:05:11,167
Everything is over.

1401
01:05:11,167 --> 01:05:11,958
Hey, come on.

1402
01:05:11,958 --> 01:05:14,875
If I thump you,
you can't even breathe.

1403
01:05:14,875 --> 01:05:16,833
Hey, what have you done?

1404
01:05:16,833 --> 01:05:18,208
Don’t have time to tell now.

1405
01:05:18,208 --> 01:05:19,333
Have you brought the garland
and mangalsutra? Give me.

1406
01:05:19,333 --> 01:05:20,125
Take it.
-Give me.

1407
01:05:21,167 --> 01:05:21,917
Why are you standing away?

1408
01:05:21,917 --> 01:05:22,292
Come on.

1409
01:05:23,583 --> 01:05:26,167
Wonder, where it will end!

1410
01:05:26,167 --> 01:05:27,375
You come, first.
-Wait, I'll come.

1411
01:05:27,375 --> 01:05:28,792
Hey, where is the mangalsutra?

1412
01:05:28,792 --> 01:05:30,375
Give me the mangalsutra.
-Hey, bottle.

1413
01:05:30,375 --> 01:05:32,125
If said all of a sudden,
 shouldn't we buy?

1414
01:05:32,125 --> 01:05:34,000
Congratulations!
-Why do you shake hands with me?

1415
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:34,792
Kavya, come this side.

1416
01:05:36,125 --> 01:05:37,375
Hold it.

1417
01:05:39,792 --> 01:05:40,667
Hey, hold this.

1418
01:05:41,542 --> 01:05:42,167
Come this side.

1419
01:05:46,292 --> 01:05:49,042
What are you looking at?
Exchange the garlands.

1420
01:05:49,042 --> 01:05:50,917
For whom is the marriage?
-Why should I exchange the garlands?

1421
01:05:51,458 --> 01:05:54,583
Hey, instead of you, who will
garland your uncle’s daughter?

1422
01:05:54,583 --> 01:05:55,833
Exchange the garlands.

1423
01:05:55,833 --> 01:05:56,917
Hey, why are you blabbering!

1424
01:05:57,708 --> 01:05:58,833
Hey, who is blabbering?

1425
01:05:58,833 --> 01:06:01,583
For your sake,
 I took this risk and brought her here.

1426
01:06:01,583 --> 01:06:02,500
Exchange the garlands.

1427
01:06:02,917 --> 01:06:04,917
Who told you to bring her,
without asking me?

1428
01:06:04,917 --> 01:06:07,250
All of you yelled at me
that I stopped the engagement.

1429
01:06:07,250 --> 01:06:09,500
That’s why, I convinced her
and brought here.

1430
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:12,500
Hey, uncle! Why are you silent?
Tell him.

1431
01:06:12,500 --> 01:06:16,000
He did all these for your sake.
Tie the mangalsutra, now. Let's talk later.

1432
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:17,042
Later, you pardon me.

1433
01:06:17,042 --> 01:06:18,375
For what?
-I'll tell you later.

1434
01:06:18,375 --> 01:06:20,750
Why, does he talk, ignorantly?
Keep quiet.

1435
01:06:20,750 --> 01:06:22,125
Hey, if mom and uncle know
about this, what will they do?

1436
01:06:22,125 --> 01:06:23,292
They will bless you both.

1437
01:06:25,208 --> 01:06:26,542
You don’t get tensed.

1438
01:06:26,542 --> 01:06:29,083
Like you were afraid in your house,
he is afraid now.

1439
01:06:29,083 --> 01:06:30,833
He will understand if I say!

1440
01:06:30,833 --> 01:06:33,542
She came out of the house,
trusting my word.

1441
01:06:33,542 --> 01:06:35,375
Please, listen to me.

1442
01:06:36,625 --> 01:06:37,458
Tie the mangalsutra.

1443
01:06:37,458 --> 01:06:39,125
You're talking without understanding.

1444
01:06:39,583 --> 01:06:40,542
What didn’t I understand?

1445
01:06:42,167 --> 01:06:46,208
Hey, if your engagement had not stopped,
you would’ve married Kavya, right?

1446
01:06:46,208 --> 01:06:47,625
That’s what, I'm saying now.

1447
01:06:47,875 --> 01:06:50,875
Hey, the stance on that day
and now, is different.

1448
01:06:50,875 --> 01:06:52,000
Please, understand.

1449
01:06:52,542 --> 01:06:53,208
What to understand?

1450
01:06:53,208 --> 01:06:55,458
Hey, Kavya is not a stranger.
But, your uncle’s daughter.

1451
01:06:55,458 --> 01:06:58,625
Whatever problem arises,
 it'll get settle in few days.

1452
01:06:58,625 --> 01:06:59,917
If there is any further issues,

1453
01:06:59,917 --> 01:07:01,958
Then, I'll ask apologies to each one
of them at their feet.

1454
01:07:01,958 --> 01:07:04,833
I plead you, tie the mangalsutra.
-I can’t!

1455
01:07:04,833 --> 01:07:07,708
Hey, can’t he understand?
Repeating the same though I say, I can't.

1456
01:07:07,708 --> 01:07:09,167
You’re talking without
understanding the situation.

1457
01:07:09,167 --> 01:07:12,083
Think of that girl's situation.
Tie the mangalsutra, immediately.

1458
01:07:12,083 --> 01:07:13,083
Hey, tie up!

1459
01:07:13,083 --> 01:07:16,792
I'll listen to whatever you say,
 but I can’t get married.

1460
01:07:16,792 --> 01:07:17,958
You're saying, you'll listen
to whatever we say.

1461
01:07:17,958 --> 01:07:19,083
But, you're not tying
the mangalsutra.

1462
01:07:19,083 --> 01:07:23,375
If you don’t have interest to marry me,
 why did you send the poetry and chain?

1463
01:07:23,375 --> 01:07:26,583
What?
Chain and poetry!

1464
01:07:26,583 --> 01:07:28,042
Oh, this too?

1465
01:07:29,792 --> 01:07:31,583
I didn’t give anything, Kavya!

1466
01:07:31,583 --> 01:07:33,042
I swear, I don’t know anything
 about it.

1467
01:07:33,500 --> 01:07:35,792
Look here, having authority on you,

1468
01:07:35,792 --> 01:07:38,292
I did few things without asking you
 and without your knowledge.

1469
01:07:38,292 --> 01:07:39,292
That’s not important now.

1470
01:07:40,208 --> 01:07:43,083
I plead you to tie the mangalsutra.

1471
01:07:43,083 --> 01:07:43,875
Go away!

1472
01:07:44,625 --> 01:07:46,208
You're talking without understanding
my situation.

1473
01:07:46,208 --> 01:07:48,792
Hey, Kavya
Just a minute.

1474
01:07:50,667 --> 01:07:53,500
Hey, I’m asking you for the last time.

1475
01:07:53,500 --> 01:07:54,833
If you're my friend,
tie her the mangalsutra.

1476
01:07:54,833 --> 01:07:57,000
If not, we don’t have
 any relationship.

1477
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:58,333
Can you do it or not?

1478
01:08:00,292 --> 01:08:01,083
I can’t!

1479
01:08:05,875 --> 01:08:10,250
Good! both of you keep fighting,
 I'll stand in the street.

1480
01:08:10,250 --> 01:08:12,708
Is my life meant for you
to play?

1481
01:08:12,708 --> 01:08:14,042
Now, what should I do?

1482
01:08:15,292 --> 01:08:18,500
Hey, idiots!
 do you have sense?

1483
01:08:18,500 --> 01:08:21,167
Is a girl's life,
a fun for you?

1484
01:08:21,167 --> 01:08:23,500
I understand your situation well.

1485
01:08:23,500 --> 01:08:25,292
Still, there is half an hour
for the auspicious time to end.

1486
01:08:25,292 --> 01:08:26,833
I'll drop you in the bus depot.

1487
01:08:26,833 --> 01:08:29,292
If you take a bus,
you'll reach the wedding hall in ten minutes.

1488
01:08:29,292 --> 01:08:32,000
Get married to the bridegroom
already fixed and live happily.

1489
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:32,917
Dude, is that fine?

1490
01:08:32,917 --> 01:08:34,125
Is it okay for you?

1491
01:08:36,125 --> 01:08:37,958
My good time,
I was about to tell this.

1492
01:08:37,958 --> 01:08:38,667
I got escaped.

1493
01:08:39,708 --> 01:08:41,958
Dude, she slapped me.
-Come, my dear.

1494
01:08:41,958 --> 01:08:43,542
She is not Kavya!
She is Kanchana!

1495
01:08:43,542 --> 01:08:45,667
No one should marry her.

1496
01:09:04,750 --> 01:09:06,792
They've come.
-Then, they ought to come.

1497
01:09:13,417 --> 01:09:15,833
You eloped with him
on your wedding.

1498
01:09:15,833 --> 01:09:18,458
Did you at least think of
 your father's honour?

1499
01:09:18,750 --> 01:09:21,500
Sir, nothing fault on your daughter.

1500
01:09:21,792 --> 01:09:23,708
I've forced and brought her.

1501
01:09:23,708 --> 01:09:26,458
How dare will you take my daughter?
-Hey, who are you hitting?

1502
01:09:26,458 --> 01:09:29,375
Hey, hold him.

1503
01:09:29,375 --> 01:09:30,667
Ashok!

1504
01:09:30,667 --> 01:09:32,000
Uncle!
-Leave him.

1505
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:33,292
Take away your hand.
-Why are you pushing me?

1506
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:34,917
Why are you hindering them?

1507
01:09:34,917 --> 01:09:36,042
You didn't listen me, isn't it?

1508
01:09:36,042 --> 01:09:38,208
Though they thrash
or lynch me, you shouldn't ask.

1509
01:09:38,208 --> 01:09:40,083
We aren't related in any way.

1510
01:09:41,875 --> 01:09:44,958
Sir, you haven't agreed your daughter's
marriage with him because of me.

1511
01:09:44,958 --> 01:09:48,250
That's why, I thought of bringing
your daughter and get him married.

1512
01:09:48,250 --> 01:09:51,583
But, he esteemed the relationship
 than the friendship.

1513
01:09:51,583 --> 01:09:52,750
He said, uncle's dignity
is more important...

1514
01:09:52,750 --> 01:09:53,958
...and refused to tie the mangalsutra.

1515
01:09:55,083 --> 01:09:59,667
I'm solely responsible for all
the confusions occured today.

1516
01:09:59,667 --> 01:10:01,625
Punish me as you wish.

1517
01:10:01,625 --> 01:10:04,875
Hey, even if I kill you,
will I get back my lost honour?

1518
01:10:04,875 --> 01:10:06,833
You know, it won't come back.
Then, why all are hitting him?

1519
01:10:06,833 --> 01:10:08,083
Shut your mouth.

1520
01:10:08,083 --> 01:10:09,542
What are you looking at?
Thrash him.

1521
01:10:09,542 --> 01:10:11,583
No!
-It hurts.

1522
01:10:11,583 --> 01:10:13,333
Uncle, tell not to hit him.

1523
01:10:13,333 --> 01:10:15,833
He did by mistake, uncle.
Please, uncle.

1524
01:10:15,833 --> 01:10:17,417
Hit him.
-Wait.

1525
01:10:17,417 --> 01:10:18,333
Uncle, tell not to hit him.

1526
01:10:18,333 --> 01:10:19,417
Please, uncle.
-Leave him.

1527
01:10:19,417 --> 01:10:20,542
Thank you, uncle.

1528
01:10:21,958 --> 01:10:23,208
Bring my daughter.

1529
01:10:25,375 --> 01:10:26,917
Wonder, this has happened to you!

1530
01:10:26,917 --> 01:10:28,917
Your father thought, everyone
 should praise your wedding.

1531
01:10:28,917 --> 01:10:30,667
It's your fate.
-It turned worst.

1532
01:10:31,208 --> 01:10:33,917
You should've luck.

1533
01:10:34,167 --> 01:10:36,208
Dude, they've hurt your mouth.

1534
01:10:37,083 --> 01:10:38,583
Will they kiss me?

1535
01:10:40,917 --> 01:10:43,417
Oh, no! He is calling.

1536
01:10:44,500 --> 01:10:46,167
I forgot to pay the money
 in the bank.

1537
01:10:46,167 --> 01:10:47,500
Will you give this
 to Ashok's father?

1538
01:10:47,500 --> 01:10:48,875
Oh, gosh! to him?

1539
01:10:48,875 --> 01:10:52,833
Better to get thumped by your uncle
 but don't send me to him.

1540
01:10:52,833 --> 01:10:55,000
He will kill me with his words

1541
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,583
I may accompany you
 for being your friend.

1542
01:10:57,583 --> 01:10:58,833
Come on.
-Come.

1543
01:11:00,083 --> 01:11:01,833
I expected this.

1544
01:11:03,167 --> 01:11:04,208
Take it.

1545
01:11:04,208 --> 01:11:06,208
Why did you bring this now?
You have it.

1546
01:11:06,208 --> 01:11:08,000
The house will be auctioned
if we don't pay the money?

1547
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:09,208
How many times I told you?

1548
01:11:09,208 --> 01:11:11,292
He said, he went to abduct
the girl for your sake.

1549
01:11:11,292 --> 01:11:13,333
Your relatives came here
and creating ruckus.

1550
01:11:13,333 --> 01:11:14,750
What are you thinking?

1551
01:11:14,750 --> 01:11:15,917
Did I ask you?

1552
01:11:15,917 --> 01:11:18,125
Did I ask you to get money
from my house and pay in the bank?

1553
01:11:18,125 --> 01:11:20,292
It's okay if you don't help
 but why are you creating issues?

1554
01:11:20,292 --> 01:11:23,250
Hey, if you've dignity and honor,
don't come to my house.

1555
01:11:23,250 --> 01:11:24,125
You will be ashamed.

1556
01:11:24,125 --> 01:11:28,000
Henceforth, if your son comes home,
 I'll become a murderer.

1557
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:29,917
Gone!
Everything has gone!

1558
01:11:29,917 --> 01:11:31,833
The house where I was born
 and brought up was lost...

1559
01:11:31,833 --> 01:11:33,125
...because of trusting these stupids.

1560
01:11:33,125 --> 01:11:35,333
Stay blessed.

1561
01:11:43,375 --> 01:11:45,042
We are surviving with this mouth.

1562
01:11:45,042 --> 01:11:46,708
They hurt it, exactly.

1563
01:11:47,667 --> 01:11:50,625
It's better for you.
I can't hear after he hit me.

1564
01:11:51,542 --> 01:11:52,500
Hey!

1565
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:54,667
Dude!
-Ashok!

1566
01:12:00,167 --> 01:12:02,042
Appachi, lend me fifty rupees.
I'll give back, tomorrow.

1567
01:12:02,042 --> 01:12:04,250
It's sixty six thousand rupees.

1568
01:12:05,792 --> 01:12:07,917
Take it.
-Check it.

1569
01:12:07,917 --> 01:12:09,208
Ashok!

1570
01:12:09,583 --> 01:12:11,333
You check it.
-Ashok!

1571
01:12:11,333 --> 01:12:12,625
Hey, you...

1572
01:12:12,625 --> 01:12:14,417
Sorry, brother!
-Ashok!

1573
01:12:15,583 --> 01:12:16,667
What's this?

1574
01:12:17,125 --> 01:12:19,208
Why is he doing this, Appachi?
-He is leaving with enrage.

1575
01:12:23,542 --> 01:12:26,125
Tell me the side platters.

1576
01:12:26,125 --> 01:12:28,458
Shall I tell peas and nuts?
-Damn it.

1577
01:12:28,917 --> 01:12:30,542
It's been a long time
since I ate non vegetarian food.

1578
01:12:30,542 --> 01:12:32,125
Hold him strongly.

1579
01:12:32,125 --> 01:12:33,000
Look now.

1580
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:34,458
Chicken pepper, mutton chukka,
prawns gravy...

1581
01:12:34,458 --> 01:12:37,333
Hey...not all those.

1582
01:12:37,667 --> 01:12:39,167
Give me two boiled eggs.

1583
01:12:39,167 --> 01:12:40,333
Is boiled egg, non vegetarian food?

1584
01:12:40,333 --> 01:12:42,833
This is why, we shouldn't booze
with oldeys.

1585
01:12:42,833 --> 01:12:44,417
Here is the boiled eggs.

1586
01:12:44,958 --> 01:12:47,292
All of you take the boiled eggs.

1587
01:12:47,292 --> 01:12:48,333
All of us?

1588
01:12:48,333 --> 01:12:50,750
Did I keep any of my photos
 in my shop?

1589
01:12:50,750 --> 01:12:51,708
Let's do it, soon.

1590
01:12:51,708 --> 01:12:53,333
It's all your photos.

1591
01:12:53,667 --> 01:12:55,000
Did you think of the reason?

1592
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:56,958
If your photo is kept
no one will come to the shop.

1593
01:12:56,958 --> 01:12:58,750
Hey...
-Tell me.

1594
01:12:59,417 --> 01:13:01,958
Your friendship!
-Cheers!

1595
01:13:01,958 --> 01:13:05,625
If I see your photo,
I remember only your friendship.

1596
01:13:05,625 --> 01:13:09,667
Did I say that I'll transfer
the ownership to you...

1597
01:13:09,667 --> 01:13:12,042
...thinking, you'll become
 business magnets?

1598
01:13:12,042 --> 01:13:15,375
I said just for your friendship.

1599
01:13:15,375 --> 01:13:19,667
Am I blabbering in high,
craving for friendship like you.

1600
01:13:19,667 --> 01:13:22,042
Appachi, why are you emotional now?

1601
01:13:22,042 --> 01:13:25,875
Look Anand, always Ashok
will be at fault.

1602
01:13:25,875 --> 01:13:27,458
But, this time the fault is your's.

1603
01:13:27,458 --> 01:13:29,583
Appachi, Anand is there.
-Have they changed?

1604
01:13:30,208 --> 01:13:31,875
Don't I know?
-You know!

1605
01:13:31,875 --> 01:13:34,542
Both of them are same for me.
Like my two eyes.

1606
01:13:34,542 --> 01:13:35,708
Look, how he managed.

1607
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,625
We all poked him that day.

1608
01:13:38,625 --> 01:13:43,250
That's why, he brought your
uncle's daughter.

1609
01:13:43,500 --> 01:13:45,167
What should've you done?
-What he should've done?

1610
01:13:45,167 --> 01:13:47,333
You'd have tied the mangalsutra.
-Yes, you'd have tied.

1611
01:13:47,333 --> 01:13:48,958
That's the mark of friendship.
-Yeah, it's right!

1612
01:13:48,958 --> 01:13:51,208
Appachi, you too talk
without understanding my stance.

1613
01:13:51,208 --> 01:13:52,083
What's your stance?

1614
01:13:52,083 --> 01:13:54,458
Don't we have stance?
Does he only have stance?

1615
01:13:54,458 --> 01:13:56,250
Talking useless.

1616
01:13:56,250 --> 01:13:57,750
Appachi, I'm getting furious.

1617
01:13:57,750 --> 01:13:59,208
I'll leave.
-Hey, sit down.

1618
01:13:59,208 --> 01:14:00,625
Sit down.

1619
01:14:00,625 --> 01:14:03,583
We are more furious people
than you, but sitting quiet.

1620
01:14:03,583 --> 01:14:04,750
He said it.

1621
01:14:05,292 --> 01:14:08,542
He didn't esteem
 the friendship as I did.

1622
01:14:09,333 --> 01:14:10,625
Not like that, Appachi.

1623
01:14:10,958 --> 01:14:12,958
I'll give my life for his sake.

1624
01:14:12,958 --> 01:14:14,500
I might yell at you.

1625
01:14:15,292 --> 01:14:18,292
Ask him to tell, at least one right thing
 which happened on that day.

1626
01:14:18,750 --> 01:14:20,000
I'll obey you, whatever it is.

1627
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:20,792
What?

1628
01:14:20,792 --> 01:14:22,083
It's over.

1629
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:25,583
Sofia has come back.

1630
01:14:26,500 --> 01:14:27,917
Who is Sofia?

1631
01:14:53,542 --> 01:14:55,167
Hello!
-Speak properly.

1632
01:14:55,167 --> 01:14:56,750
What about the interview?

1633
01:14:56,750 --> 01:14:58,583
Six months training at Noida.

1634
01:14:58,583 --> 01:15:00,792
Later, the posting will be somewhere
at North India.

1635
01:15:00,792 --> 01:15:02,042
So, I denied it.

1636
01:15:02,042 --> 01:15:05,542
Hey, you took up coaching sessions
for this bank job, isn't it?

1637
01:15:05,542 --> 01:15:07,708
When did I went for coaching session?

1638
01:15:07,708 --> 01:15:08,333
Then?

1639
01:15:08,333 --> 01:15:11,000
I came to meet you
with that as the reason.

1640
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:12,083
Oh, no!

1641
01:15:12,083 --> 01:15:16,333
Okay, I'll come and meet your dad.

1642
01:15:16,333 --> 01:15:18,458
It'll be a issue
 if we belong to different caste.

1643
01:15:18,458 --> 01:15:21,250
We belong to different religions.
Definitely, they will not accept.

1644
01:15:21,250 --> 01:15:23,917
Look here, listen to me carefully.

1645
01:15:23,917 --> 01:15:25,875
We both need to change our religions.

1646
01:15:25,875 --> 01:15:27,542
I'll come to your house and say,

1647
01:15:27,542 --> 01:15:30,750
'your son-in-law is a Christian...
...but not your daughter'.

1648
01:15:30,750 --> 01:15:32,583
You come to my house and say,

1649
01:15:32,583 --> 01:15:35,625
'your daughter-in-law is a Hindu...
...but not your son'.

1650
01:15:35,625 --> 01:15:37,208
All the problems will get solved.

1651
01:15:37,208 --> 01:15:38,500
You...

1652
01:15:41,792 --> 01:15:42,667
Why are you staring me?

1653
01:15:42,667 --> 01:15:45,583
Watched 'Poove unakkaga' film
and telling me the story.

1654
01:15:45,583 --> 01:15:47,625
Don't take it just as a film,
the notion will work.

1655
01:15:47,625 --> 01:15:51,667
You can convert to other religion
 but how about the caste?

1656
01:15:51,667 --> 01:15:53,875
If you ask questions like this,
 I'll jump down.

1657
01:15:53,875 --> 01:15:55,083
Better jump.

1658
01:15:55,083 --> 01:15:57,125
No one has answers
for these questions.

1659
01:15:57,125 --> 01:15:57,958
Let me think.

1660
01:15:57,958 --> 01:15:59,125
No need to think.

1661
01:15:59,125 --> 01:15:59,458
Okay.

1662
01:15:59,458 --> 01:16:00,542
Listen to what I say.

1663
01:16:01,042 --> 01:16:03,083
After coming back from church
on Sunday...

1664
01:16:03,083 --> 01:16:05,083
... my dad will be in a good mood
 to some extent.

1665
01:16:05,083 --> 01:16:06,500
You come and talk, then.

1666
01:16:06,500 --> 01:16:08,625
I will tell you right away...

1667
01:16:08,625 --> 01:16:11,333
He will shout to the core.
-It's okay.

1668
01:16:11,333 --> 01:16:14,542
There are chances to yell at you.
-I'll accept it.

1669
01:16:14,958 --> 01:16:17,708
There are chances he might
 ask you to convert as a Christian.

1670
01:16:17,708 --> 01:16:18,667
That's all?

1671
01:16:18,667 --> 01:16:20,250
If your dad agrees,
 I'll become a father too.

1672
01:16:20,250 --> 01:16:23,500
Hey, how will you marry me
if you become a father?

1673
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,250
You goof.
Not the father of Church...

1674
01:16:26,792 --> 01:16:29,083
I said, we will get married
and become father of our child.

1675
01:16:29,083 --> 01:16:34,583
"The day I saw you..."

1676
01:16:34,583 --> 01:16:40,208
"The day I saw myself in life"

1677
01:16:40,208 --> 01:16:46,750
"Like the drizzles on my window,
You stood and went away"

1678
01:16:46,750 --> 01:16:49,750
"What could I do?"

1679
01:16:49,750 --> 01:16:53,208
"You're killing me
with caressing words"

1680
01:16:53,208 --> 01:16:56,333
"Who are you, Sofia?"

1681
01:16:56,333 --> 01:16:59,250
"Are you the selfie
of a pine tree flower?"

1682
01:16:59,250 --> 01:17:02,333
"You're the mafia of the mind"

1683
01:17:02,333 --> 01:17:05,333
"Would you say a little?"

1684
01:17:05,333 --> 01:17:08,375
"Who are you, Sofia?"

1685
01:17:08,375 --> 01:17:11,208
"Are you the selfie
of a pine tree flower?"

1686
01:17:11,208 --> 01:17:14,208
"You're the mafia of the mind"

1687
01:17:14,208 --> 01:17:17,625
"Would you say a little?"

1688
01:17:27,375 --> 01:17:28,708
What do you want, uncle?

1689
01:17:28,708 --> 01:17:30,333
The sister in the opposite house
should come out, right?

1690
01:17:30,333 --> 01:17:33,583
Yes, I'm waiting since morning.
But can't see her, yet.

1691
01:17:33,583 --> 01:17:36,083
Okay, hold this bottle.

1692
01:17:36,083 --> 01:17:38,042
If I hold this, will she come out?
-She will come.

1693
01:17:38,042 --> 01:17:39,500
Don't hold it, straight.
Hold it, slantingly.

1694
01:17:39,500 --> 01:17:41,458
Slanting?
Is this enough?

1695
01:17:41,458 --> 01:17:43,542
Why are you taking the rocket?

1696
01:17:43,542 --> 01:17:45,333
Why are you keeping it
 in the bottle?

1697
01:17:45,333 --> 01:17:47,833
Hey, why are you lighting it?
Hey!

1698
01:17:49,042 --> 01:17:50,375
It's over!

1699
01:17:50,375 --> 01:17:53,083
Oh, no!
Grandpa!

1700
01:17:53,083 --> 01:17:56,667
Anand uncle has broken the window glass
 of opposite house.

1701
01:17:58,125 --> 01:17:59,917
Oh, gosh!

1702
01:17:59,917 --> 01:18:01,833
Why did you break the
window glass of opposite house?

1703
01:18:01,833 --> 01:18:04,125
Hey, I didn't do.
The junior Ashok did it.

1704
01:18:04,125 --> 01:18:05,417
He ran away.

1705
01:18:05,417 --> 01:18:07,708
Oh, no! They're coming along
with the family.

1706
01:18:07,708 --> 01:18:09,542
You idiots!
-Oh, gosh!

1707
01:18:09,542 --> 01:18:11,292
Will you fire the rocket
 inside the house?

1708
01:18:11,292 --> 01:18:13,083
Sorry, sir.
The address has been changed.

1709
01:18:13,083 --> 01:18:15,750
If it fell on us?
-Your mouth would've been torn.

1710
01:18:15,750 --> 01:18:17,208
What?
-Nothing, uncle.

1711
01:18:17,208 --> 01:18:18,625
You go, uncle.
-You go, sir.

1712
01:18:18,625 --> 01:18:19,458
Hereafter, the rocket will not come.

1713
01:18:19,458 --> 01:18:20,792
It's over.
-Get in.

1714
01:18:20,792 --> 01:18:22,708
Why are you bursting crackers for love?
-Uncle.

1715
01:18:22,708 --> 01:18:23,583
'Happy Diwali'.

1716
01:18:24,208 --> 01:18:25,167
Wastrel.

1717
01:18:25,167 --> 01:18:30,250
"I walk like an ant
on the sweet road"

1718
01:18:30,250 --> 01:18:36,583
"I roll like a ball in
a basket of laughter"

1719
01:18:36,583 --> 01:18:42,458
"Are you born with
 cotton blossoms?"

1720
01:18:42,458 --> 01:18:48,542
"Am I a saint to close
 my eyes and go?"

1721
01:18:48,542 --> 01:18:54,917
"When I cross your home,
I breath heavily"

1722
01:18:54,917 --> 01:18:58,625
"Whenever your hands
 make gestures"

1723
01:18:58,625 --> 01:19:00,875
"My legs are on cloud nine"

1724
01:19:00,875 --> 01:19:04,500
"She enticed the smell
of my breath"

1725
01:19:04,500 --> 01:19:07,250
"She added herbs to my breath"

1726
01:19:07,250 --> 01:19:10,292
"She is the yearning of my life"

1727
01:19:10,292 --> 01:19:13,333
"Blossomed for my home"

1728
01:19:13,333 --> 01:19:16,333
"She enticed the smell
of my breath"

1729
01:19:16,333 --> 01:19:19,333
"She added herbs to my breath"

1730
01:19:19,333 --> 01:19:22,292
"She is the yearning of my life"

1731
01:19:22,292 --> 01:19:25,792
"Blossomed for my home"

1732
01:19:37,167 --> 01:19:39,083
If you get selected in
the National Kabaddi camp,

1733
01:19:39,083 --> 01:19:40,083
You'll get the appointment,
straight away.

1734
01:19:40,083 --> 01:19:43,625
You will settle in life and
take care of our settlements too.

1735
01:19:43,625 --> 01:19:45,500
All these opportunities
are in your hand.

1736
01:19:46,708 --> 01:19:49,167
He is talking to you.
But, you're busy with your phone.

1737
01:19:49,167 --> 01:19:49,958
What?

1738
01:19:49,958 --> 01:19:51,292
I can understand well.

1739
01:19:51,292 --> 01:19:53,417
You will miss me for ten days.

1740
01:19:53,417 --> 01:19:55,042
Is it a issue?
Give your phone.

1741
01:19:55,042 --> 01:19:56,667
I'll set my photo as wallpaper.

1742
01:19:58,792 --> 01:20:00,000
Shame!

1743
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:01,583
Good, no one has seen.
-I saw you.

1744
01:20:01,583 --> 01:20:02,708
Take it.
Be quiet, uncle.

1745
01:20:03,167 --> 01:20:05,500
Sofia said she will come.

1746
01:20:06,500 --> 01:20:08,792
I don't know how I would be
without seeing her for ten days.

1747
01:20:08,792 --> 01:20:11,417
It's the national meet.
Go happily.

1748
01:20:11,417 --> 01:20:12,042
Good...

1749
01:20:12,042 --> 01:20:13,083
Uncle, don't interfere.
Be silent.

1750
01:20:13,083 --> 01:20:14,750
You can speak with Sofia on phone.
You leave.

1751
01:20:14,750 --> 01:20:16,417
Go, dude.
-You leave.

1752
01:20:16,958 --> 01:20:18,208
Look him, uncle.
He is not going.

1753
01:20:18,208 --> 01:20:18,458
Go.

1754
01:20:19,625 --> 01:20:21,125
I will miss you too.
-It's okay.

1755
01:20:21,125 --> 01:20:23,292
We know who will you miss!
Go.

1756
01:20:23,292 --> 01:20:27,375
Dude, win the match.
Go soon.

1757
01:20:27,375 --> 01:20:30,375
Good, you're late by five minutes.
-Why?

1758
01:20:30,375 --> 01:20:31,625
He wouldn't have gone
if he had seen you.

1759
01:20:31,625 --> 01:20:33,500
Leave it, no problem.
He will be back in ten days.

1760
01:20:33,500 --> 01:20:35,875
You can speak to him on phone.
Don't be emotional.

1761
01:20:35,875 --> 01:20:37,417
He left but who is she smiling at?

1762
01:20:37,417 --> 01:20:38,875
I told you not to get emotional.

1763
01:20:38,875 --> 01:20:40,333
I didn't tell you to smile.

1764
01:20:40,333 --> 01:20:41,292
Why are you smiling?

1765
01:20:41,875 --> 01:20:43,458
He has come.

1766
01:20:43,458 --> 01:20:45,083
Everything has gone.

1767
01:20:45,083 --> 01:20:46,333
He came to buy a water bottle.

1768
01:20:46,333 --> 01:20:47,333
Did you think I left?

1769
01:20:48,042 --> 01:20:49,542
You said, it's a national meet.

1770
01:20:49,542 --> 01:20:53,583
That's not important to me
than meeting you.

1771
01:20:53,583 --> 01:20:56,042
Just ten days,
you should've gone.

1772
01:20:56,042 --> 01:20:57,792
I can't stay even a day
without seeing you.

1773
01:20:57,792 --> 01:21:02,917
"My heart was broken
in a moment"

1774
01:21:02,917 --> 01:21:08,917
"The Bible page looked
 like a poetry"

1775
01:21:08,917 --> 01:21:15,125
"When you stand
like the doll made on mould"

1776
01:21:15,125 --> 01:21:21,042
"I worshipped in the church, everyday
with flowers and fruits"

1777
01:21:21,042 --> 01:21:27,083
"I can count on living
a long life with you"

1778
01:21:27,083 --> 01:21:33,417
"My days pass with you
 in my breath"

1779
01:21:34,917 --> 01:21:37,250
"She enticed the smell
of my breath"

1780
01:21:37,250 --> 01:21:40,792
"She added herbs to my breath"

1781
01:21:40,792 --> 01:21:43,167
"She is the yearning of my life"

1782
01:21:43,167 --> 01:21:46,583
"Blossomed for my home"

1783
01:21:50,375 --> 01:21:53,000
How many years have you been
 in love with me?

1784
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
From my college days.
Why?

1785
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:58,167
Have you ever proposed me?
-Propose?

1786
01:21:59,458 --> 01:22:00,750
See tomorrow.

1787
01:22:02,375 --> 01:22:05,750
Sir, I'm coming in ten minutes.
On the way, sir.

1788
01:22:05,750 --> 01:22:06,875
Okay, sir.

1789
01:22:10,542 --> 01:22:12,958
Hey, where did you keep
 the bike keys?

1790
01:22:12,958 --> 01:22:15,458
I'm getting it.
You kept here and searching there.

1791
01:22:15,458 --> 01:22:16,792
Take it.
-Give me.

1792
01:22:16,792 --> 01:22:17,875
You need a person to get the keys.

1793
01:22:17,875 --> 01:22:19,000
Oh, god!

1794
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:20,667
Oh, no!
Dear, have some water.

1795
01:22:20,667 --> 01:22:21,500
Come in.

1796
01:22:21,500 --> 01:22:24,958
I'm going in hurry.
You want to me to have water.

1797
01:22:24,958 --> 01:22:27,292
Why are you in hurry?
Can't you go, patiently.

1798
01:22:27,292 --> 01:22:28,750
Always in hurry.

1799
01:22:29,292 --> 01:22:32,333
Whose car is this?
-This is the last ball.

1800
01:22:32,333 --> 01:22:34,333
Damn it.

1801
01:22:35,750 --> 01:22:37,250
How many times to say...

1802
01:22:37,250 --> 01:22:38,542
...not to park the car
at the entrance of the house?

1803
01:22:38,542 --> 01:22:40,875
Should I wait for them,
each and every time I go out?

1804
01:22:40,875 --> 01:22:43,833
Whose car is this?
-it's the opposite house car, grandpa.

1805
01:22:43,833 --> 01:22:44,792
Call them.
Uncle, my grandpa is calling you.

1806
01:22:45,667 --> 01:22:47,625
Dear, be patient.
-Uncle, my grandpa is calling.

1807
01:22:47,625 --> 01:22:48,542
They will take it.

1808
01:22:48,542 --> 01:22:52,083
He parked at the entrance, boldly.
You want me to be patient.

1809
01:22:52,083 --> 01:22:52,667
Get lost.

1810
01:22:52,667 --> 01:22:55,500
Dear, don't shout on the road.

1811
01:22:56,333 --> 01:22:58,083
Hey, whose car is this?

1812
01:22:58,083 --> 01:23:00,500
If you park like this,
 how should we come out of the house?

1813
01:23:00,500 --> 01:23:02,500
Should we break the car and come?

1814
01:23:02,500 --> 01:23:03,875
Sorry, sir! Another vehicle was there
at front. That's why...

1815
01:23:03,875 --> 01:23:06,208
Do you've sense?
Take the vehicle soon.

1816
01:23:06,208 --> 01:23:07,667
He said he will take the vehicle.

1817
01:23:07,667 --> 01:23:09,083
Why are you talking about
 sense and all.

1818
01:23:09,083 --> 01:23:11,583
Don't shout.
-I have kept a 'No parking' board.

1819
01:23:11,583 --> 01:23:14,042
I told you many times not to park
 the vehicle there.

1820
01:23:14,042 --> 01:23:16,167
Still you do it,
I can ask whether you've sense?

1821
01:23:16,167 --> 01:23:18,542
Can I come and say all your guests
 not to park the vehicle?

1822
01:23:18,542 --> 01:23:20,292
First, you should have sense.

1823
01:23:20,292 --> 01:23:22,375
If you talk anything more,
 you'll be disgraced.

1824
01:23:22,375 --> 01:23:23,458
Dad!
Shut up.

1825
01:23:23,458 --> 01:23:25,208
What?
What's your problem?

1826
01:23:25,208 --> 01:23:27,250
If given respect,
you're talking too much.

1827
01:23:27,250 --> 01:23:28,625
Was the vehicle parked
inside your house?

1828
01:23:28,625 --> 01:23:29,875
It's parked on the road.

1829
01:23:29,875 --> 01:23:30,750
Get lost.

1830
01:23:30,750 --> 01:23:31,875
We can't take, get lost.

1831
01:23:31,875 --> 01:23:34,417
Hey, what's your age and mine?
You're talking disrespectfully.

1832
01:23:34,417 --> 01:23:35,458
Oh, no!

1833
01:23:41,083 --> 01:23:43,333
Dear!

1834
01:23:43,333 --> 01:23:44,708
Oh, Dad!

1835
01:23:50,833 --> 01:23:51,375
Dad!

1836
01:23:53,792 --> 01:23:54,958
Get up.

1837
01:23:54,958 --> 01:23:56,458
What happened, dad?

1838
01:23:56,458 --> 01:23:57,917
Anand, thrash him.

1839
01:24:05,667 --> 01:24:06,583
What happened, mom?

1840
01:24:06,583 --> 01:24:09,333
They've parked the vehicle
 at the entrance of the house.

1841
01:24:09,333 --> 01:24:10,458
Dad told them to take it.

1842
01:24:10,458 --> 01:24:11,833
For that, they hit him
and pushed down.

1843
01:24:11,833 --> 01:24:12,625
Why?

1844
01:24:12,625 --> 01:24:13,625
Hey, take him.

1845
01:24:13,625 --> 01:24:15,333
Don't create ruckus before my house.

1846
01:24:15,333 --> 01:24:16,875
I'll bang you.
-Hey, keep quiet.

1847
01:24:16,875 --> 01:24:18,333
Will you bang?
Do it, let me see.

1848
01:24:18,333 --> 01:24:19,042
Hey!

1849
01:24:19,042 --> 01:24:19,833
Alex!

1850
01:24:19,833 --> 01:24:21,250
Oh, no!

1851
01:24:27,708 --> 01:24:28,667
Alex!

1852
01:24:31,458 --> 01:24:33,500
Oh, no!
Don't want.

1853
01:24:33,500 --> 01:24:34,417
Leave him.

1854
01:24:34,417 --> 01:24:35,875
Listen to me.

1855
01:24:35,875 --> 01:24:39,583
Leave me.

1856
01:24:40,792 --> 01:24:42,083
I said, leave me.

1857
01:24:48,875 --> 01:24:49,792
Whom are you hitting?

1858
01:24:49,792 --> 01:24:51,083
Get lost!

1859
01:24:52,417 --> 01:24:53,750
Alex!

1860
01:24:53,750 --> 01:24:56,292
I told you not to create problem.
-Leave him.

1861
01:24:56,292 --> 01:24:57,167
You go, sir.

1862
01:24:57,167 --> 01:24:58,708
Leave him.
-Leave me, sir.

1863
01:24:59,583 --> 01:25:00,958
Dad!

1864
01:25:00,958 --> 01:25:02,083
Dear!

1865
01:25:02,083 --> 01:25:04,667
Dear!

1866
01:25:05,083 --> 01:25:06,667
Dad!

1867
01:25:08,417 --> 01:25:09,625
Dear!

1868
01:25:09,625 --> 01:25:11,000
Oh, no!

1869
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:12,917
Dad!

1870
01:25:16,750 --> 01:25:17,417
Slowly!

1871
01:25:17,417 --> 01:25:18,625
Get up, slowly.

1872
01:25:18,625 --> 01:25:22,250
Give the hand.

1873
01:25:24,833 --> 01:25:25,792
Be careful.

1874
01:25:33,833 --> 01:25:37,125
Just a car parking issue.
You had hit him for that.

1875
01:25:37,125 --> 01:25:39,625
My dad doesn't have sense
but what about you?

1876
01:25:40,042 --> 01:25:42,292
They hit dad and
pushed him down.

1877
01:25:42,292 --> 01:25:44,917
He tells to hit them back.
What can I do?

1878
01:25:44,917 --> 01:25:47,458
It's okay, you had hit Sofia's brother.
But, why did you hit her father?

1879
01:25:47,458 --> 01:25:48,792
I didn't hit him.

1880
01:25:48,792 --> 01:25:50,542
He came to hit me,
 I just hindered.

1881
01:25:50,542 --> 01:25:52,458
He slipped and fell down.
-Hindered him?

1882
01:25:52,458 --> 01:25:55,458
Like Mike Tyson, you kicked him
and pushed in the drainage.

1883
01:25:55,458 --> 01:25:56,792
Talks are going on so.

1884
01:25:56,792 --> 01:25:57,208
What?

1885
01:25:57,208 --> 01:26:00,667
They are telling lies.
I didn't hit him. He fell on his own.

1886
01:26:00,667 --> 01:26:03,375
Yeah, that's a big swimming pool.
He has fell into that, willingly.

1887
01:26:03,375 --> 01:26:06,167
Doing everything and talking too.
-Look at him and his trousers!

1888
01:26:06,167 --> 01:26:08,250
What to do now?

1889
01:26:08,250 --> 01:26:09,208
Did you speak to Sofia?

1890
01:26:09,208 --> 01:26:10,417
I called her, she isn't attending.

1891
01:26:10,417 --> 01:26:11,542
Did she speak to you?

1892
01:26:12,458 --> 01:26:14,458
Hey, idiot! She didn't attend
when I called her.

1893
01:26:14,458 --> 01:26:15,375
Then, how will she speak to me?

1894
01:26:15,375 --> 01:26:16,750
That's all.
-'That's all', means?

1895
01:26:16,750 --> 01:26:18,208
That means, 'that's all'.

1896
01:26:18,208 --> 01:26:20,917
Will any problem arise for my love
 because of this?

1897
01:26:20,917 --> 01:26:22,792
How it will arise?
It'll arise only if there is anything.

1898
01:26:22,792 --> 01:26:24,958
Better, join my WhatsApp group, Virgin.

1899
01:26:24,958 --> 01:26:26,708
Hey, uncle!
Be quiet.

1900
01:26:26,708 --> 01:26:29,042
He is already tensed.
Iritating him saying WhatsApp.

1901
01:26:29,042 --> 01:26:31,375
Shall I go to their house
and ask for apology?

1902
01:26:31,375 --> 01:26:33,167
He will not let you
 inside the house.

1903
01:26:33,167 --> 01:26:35,750
Have to take some elder person
 and talk, tomorrow.

1904
01:26:35,750 --> 01:26:38,000
Ashok, I'm here, right?

1905
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,958
He will not let him in the house.

1906
01:26:40,958 --> 01:26:42,167
But, you'll not be allowed
even in the street.

1907
01:26:42,167 --> 01:26:43,292
Do you know one thing?

1908
01:26:43,292 --> 01:26:45,083
Sofia's father and my brother
studied together.

1909
01:26:45,083 --> 01:26:46,458
He likes me a lot.

1910
01:26:46,458 --> 01:26:50,292
I was chubby and cute
 in my childhood. He'll caress me.

1911
01:26:50,292 --> 01:26:50,708
Shit.

1912
01:26:50,708 --> 01:26:52,875
You're an unlucky fellow.

1913
01:26:52,875 --> 01:26:54,167
He will feel all alone.

1914
01:26:55,500 --> 01:26:57,375
Keeping the hands on head..
-Go...

1915
01:26:57,375 --> 01:26:58,250
Sir!

1916
01:27:00,167 --> 01:27:01,583
Come in.

1917
01:27:01,583 --> 01:27:04,500
Have you come to hit me
 as what your friend did isn't enough?

1918
01:27:04,500 --> 01:27:06,625
Sir, I came to apologize.

1919
01:27:06,625 --> 01:27:11,917
Come inside.
-It's stinks.

1920
01:27:11,917 --> 01:27:14,958
Be seated.
Sit down.

1921
01:27:17,708 --> 01:27:20,500
Why does it stinks?
Is the drainage clogged?

1922
01:27:20,500 --> 01:27:22,125
Hey, uncle.
Sir!

1923
01:27:22,125 --> 01:27:25,583
The stinking smell is on me.
Your friend Anand did this.

1924
01:27:25,583 --> 01:27:27,167
Are you better now, brother?

1925
01:27:27,167 --> 01:27:30,792
Nothing for me.
Alex had a fracture in hand.

1926
01:27:30,792 --> 01:27:32,208
Unnecessaril, he got furious.

1927
01:27:32,208 --> 01:27:35,750
But Puli, I'll file a case
and imprison him.

1928
01:27:35,750 --> 01:27:38,708
Brother, it happened by mistake.
Don't take it to the heart.

1929
01:27:38,708 --> 01:27:40,750
He said he will come
to ask apology.

1930
01:27:40,750 --> 01:27:42,833
But, we said we'll talk to you.

1931
01:27:42,833 --> 01:27:45,250
He is acting, Puli.
He is a wastrel.

1932
01:27:45,250 --> 01:27:46,042
Don't say like that, brother.

1933
01:27:46,042 --> 01:27:47,750
Not like that, sir.
He is a good guy.

1934
01:27:48,917 --> 01:27:52,208
How many years have
we been in the opposite house?

1935
01:27:52,208 --> 01:27:54,000
Has any problem emerged?
-Not that...

1936
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,792
Always, he has an eye
on my house.

1937
01:27:56,792 --> 01:27:58,125
The reason is your daughter.

1938
01:27:58,125 --> 01:28:01,000
He will ever stare here.

1939
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:05,125
Some people don't like Christians.
He is of that category.

1940
01:28:05,125 --> 01:28:07,167
Oh, Jesus!
-You speak!

1941
01:28:07,167 --> 01:28:07,875
What?

1942
01:28:07,875 --> 01:28:09,000
-Nothing.
-Nothing.

1943
01:28:10,042 --> 01:28:13,250
Sir, he has done this to you
 because of his affection for my father.

1944
01:28:13,250 --> 01:28:14,917
No.

1945
01:28:14,917 --> 01:28:17,458
Earlier, he fired the rocket
and smashed the glass window.

1946
01:28:17,458 --> 01:28:18,125
You had escaped on that day.

1947
01:28:18,125 --> 01:28:21,292
Yesterday, he hit us using
this parking issue.

1948
01:28:21,292 --> 01:28:22,500
I'll forgive even your father.

1949
01:28:22,500 --> 01:28:24,625
We both are elders
and indulged in fight.

1950
01:28:24,625 --> 01:28:26,292
Who is he to hit us?

1951
01:28:28,042 --> 01:28:30,375
That's why, I'm saying.
He did this, intentionally.

1952
01:28:30,375 --> 01:28:33,125
Sir!
Be quiet.

1953
01:28:33,125 --> 01:28:35,083
Sir, he didn't do intentionally.

1954
01:28:35,083 --> 01:28:40,500
You're the father of his lovelady.
Why should he hit you intentionally?

1955
01:28:40,500 --> 01:28:41,792
What?

1956
01:28:41,792 --> 01:28:44,333
Be louder. He didn't hear it seems.

1957
01:28:48,292 --> 01:28:51,958
Sir, Sofia and Anand are in love.

1958
01:28:51,958 --> 01:28:54,708
Sir, we thought of telling you
 this week.

1959
01:28:54,708 --> 01:28:57,625
But, this has happened.

1960
01:28:57,625 --> 01:28:58,458
Get up!

1961
01:28:58,458 --> 01:29:01,583
Am I looking like a dump head?
-Lightly.

1962
01:29:01,583 --> 01:29:05,167
That scoundrel had hit me,
without respecting my age.

1963
01:29:05,167 --> 01:29:06,833
My son had a fracture
and I'm suffering.

1964
01:29:06,833 --> 01:29:11,292
At this moment, how dare
you talk about his love?

1965
01:29:11,292 --> 01:29:13,750
I let you into the house,
 because you wish to apologize.

1966
01:29:13,750 --> 01:29:14,958
Get out.

1967
01:29:14,958 --> 01:29:17,083
I know when and to whom
 should my daughter get married.

1968
01:29:17,083 --> 01:29:18,500
Get lost.

1969
01:29:19,125 --> 01:29:21,625
Come, let's go before he blasts.

1970
01:29:21,625 --> 01:29:23,083
Go in.

1971
01:29:23,083 --> 01:29:24,500
He says to go in and out.

1972
01:29:24,500 --> 01:29:26,458
It's not wrong to push him
 into the drain.

1973
01:29:28,458 --> 01:29:31,958
Hey, you said you were chubby
and he will caress you.

1974
01:29:31,958 --> 01:29:32,667
What happened now?

1975
01:29:32,667 --> 01:29:34,750
He behaved badly
 because of stenchy smell.

1976
01:29:34,750 --> 01:29:38,000
Else, he is fond of me.
Today, his mood has changed.

1977
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:39,875
Yes, he will caress.
He left you without thumping.

1978
01:29:39,875 --> 01:29:41,458
-Will he thump me?

1979
01:29:41,458 --> 01:29:43,583
I shouldn't bend before him.

1980
01:30:01,708 --> 01:30:04,125
So many things has happened?

1981
01:30:04,125 --> 01:30:07,792
Okay, she got married.

1982
01:30:07,792 --> 01:30:08,750
Then?

1983
01:30:10,875 --> 01:30:14,042
On that day, I went to Ashok's house
to get the money.

1984
01:30:14,042 --> 01:30:16,042
I saw Sofia, again.

1985
01:30:21,333 --> 01:30:23,042
Mom, Sofia is here!

1986
01:30:23,042 --> 01:30:25,042
Pity on Sofia!

1987
01:30:25,833 --> 01:30:27,583
She got married, isn't it?

1988
01:30:27,583 --> 01:30:30,125
Her husband died in a flight accident.

1989
01:30:30,125 --> 01:30:33,500
After that, she came here.
Her life ruined.

1990
01:30:34,792 --> 01:30:37,583
Thinking, Sofia is living happily,
 somewhere...

1991
01:30:37,583 --> 01:30:40,583
...I changed my mind
and agreed to get married.

1992
01:30:40,583 --> 01:30:45,583
If I wouldn't have seen her,
 I would've listened to what he said.

1993
01:30:45,583 --> 01:30:49,917
After seeing her in that stance,
 I couldn't think about my life.

1994
01:30:51,250 --> 01:30:53,250
Now tell me, Appachi.
What I did is wrong?

1995
01:30:55,125 --> 01:30:57,500
What you did is not wrong.

1996
01:31:02,333 --> 01:31:04,625
Appachi!
Welcome!

1997
01:31:04,625 --> 01:31:07,500
It's a wonder!
You've come.

1998
01:31:07,500 --> 01:31:09,458
Are you doing good?
-Yeah, I'm good.

1999
01:31:09,458 --> 01:31:11,333
He is our guy Anand.
-I know him.

2000
01:31:11,333 --> 01:31:12,875
The Captain of the Kabaddi team.
-Yes.

2001
01:31:12,875 --> 01:31:14,833
You played here
four years before.

2002
01:31:14,833 --> 01:31:15,917
Do you remember?
-Yes.

2003
01:31:15,917 --> 01:31:18,167
Till now, our guys utter
 only your name.

2004
01:31:18,167 --> 01:31:19,458
Be seated.

2005
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,667
Appachi, what's the matter?

2006
01:31:23,667 --> 01:31:27,042
Last week, you bought an house
 in auction, didn't you?

2007
01:31:27,042 --> 01:31:28,292
Yes, to the back of the temple.

2008
01:31:28,292 --> 01:31:29,458
Any problem in that?

2009
01:31:29,458 --> 01:31:31,208
No problem.

2010
01:31:31,208 --> 01:31:33,458
That's the house of the guy
 known to me.

2011
01:31:33,458 --> 01:31:34,083
Okay.

2012
01:31:34,083 --> 01:31:35,708
He had arranged the money
on that day.

2013
01:31:35,708 --> 01:31:37,333
A small problem has occured.

2014
01:31:37,333 --> 01:31:39,125
Meanwhile, you bought the house
in auction.

2015
01:31:39,125 --> 01:31:39,792
Is it?

2016
01:31:39,792 --> 01:31:41,667
That's his ancestral house.

2017
01:31:41,667 --> 01:31:43,458
He feels bad as it was lost.

2018
01:31:43,458 --> 01:31:45,792
Is it your's, dude?
-No, it's Ashok's house.

2019
01:31:45,792 --> 01:31:48,417
You mean the defence player?
-Yes, brother.

2020
01:31:48,417 --> 01:31:50,125
He is a good player.

2021
01:31:50,875 --> 01:31:53,167
He won the Kabaddi match
 and lost the house.

2022
01:31:53,167 --> 01:31:54,667
You shouldn't mistake us.

2023
01:31:54,667 --> 01:31:59,958
We are ready to give
 a better amount than you expect.

2024
01:31:59,958 --> 01:32:02,250
It'll be good
 if you give us the house.

2025
01:32:02,250 --> 01:32:04,333
We will never forget
 your help.

2026
01:32:05,417 --> 01:32:06,958
Is it?

2027
01:32:06,958 --> 01:32:08,292
Okay, Appachi.

2028
01:32:08,292 --> 01:32:09,833
You say it's the ancestral house.

2029
01:32:10,333 --> 01:32:11,833
You take it.

2030
01:32:11,833 --> 01:32:13,333
I don't want profit.

2031
01:32:13,333 --> 01:32:15,167
It's enough if you give me
the amount for which I bought.

2032
01:32:15,167 --> 01:32:16,750
But, you should do
me a favour.

2033
01:32:18,417 --> 01:32:20,208
Tell us, brother.
-That's nothing, dude.

2034
01:32:20,208 --> 01:32:23,750
I'm passionate of Kabaddi
since my childhood and I've a team.

2035
01:32:23,750 --> 01:32:25,958
But I can't win the cup for ten years.

2036
01:32:25,958 --> 01:32:27,542
It's a regret for me.

2037
01:32:27,542 --> 01:32:29,333
Every year we prepare
the team, strongly.

2038
01:32:29,333 --> 01:32:32,250
But, the opposite team will be
more stronger than us and wins the cup.

2039
01:32:32,250 --> 01:32:34,208
Each and every time
we reach up to finale and lose.

2040
01:32:34,208 --> 01:32:35,583
This has become routine.

2041
01:32:35,583 --> 01:32:37,042
It's very humiliating, Appachi.

2042
01:32:37,042 --> 01:32:40,917
So, you and Ashok should play
 for my team and win the cup.

2043
01:32:40,917 --> 01:32:41,708
Will you do?

2044
01:32:41,958 --> 01:32:43,583
That's all?

2045
01:32:43,583 --> 01:32:45,542
You're doing a great help.

2046
01:32:45,542 --> 01:32:47,583
What work they have
other than this?

2047
01:32:47,583 --> 01:32:50,083
What Anand?
-Yeah, we will play.

2048
01:32:50,083 --> 01:32:51,167
Then, what?

2049
01:32:51,167 --> 01:32:52,375
Anand has said.

2050
01:32:52,375 --> 01:32:55,375
Your team will win
and get the cup, this year.

2051
01:32:55,375 --> 01:32:56,417
Not that, Appachi.

2052
01:32:56,417 --> 01:32:57,708
You don't know about
the opposite team.

2053
01:32:57,708 --> 01:33:00,000
If they're aware that these guys
 are playing, they will do anything to win.

2054
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:04,042
You don't know about our guys.

2055
01:33:04,042 --> 01:33:09,083
No one can do anything
either on or off the ground.

2056
01:33:09,083 --> 01:33:11,625
The cup is for you.
I assure you.

2057
01:33:11,625 --> 01:33:13,125
That's enough, Appachi.

2058
01:33:13,125 --> 01:33:14,125
Hey, Palani!
-Brother!

2059
01:33:14,125 --> 01:33:15,208
Bring the document.

2060
01:33:15,208 --> 01:33:18,167
Here is the document of your house.
We've redeemed it.

2061
01:33:19,083 --> 01:33:20,375
Where did you go
 for two days?

2062
01:33:20,375 --> 01:33:21,917
You shouted at Anand, on that day.

2063
01:33:21,917 --> 01:33:23,833
Did he utter any word
against you?

2064
01:33:23,833 --> 01:33:25,083
You lost your house, on that day.

2065
01:33:25,083 --> 01:33:25,875
And you got it back, now.

2066
01:33:25,875 --> 01:33:27,917
But, he lost his life
 because of you.

2067
01:33:27,917 --> 01:33:29,208
Can you give him back?

2068
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:31,083
Did he lose his life
 because of me?

2069
01:33:31,083 --> 01:33:32,583
What is he saying?

2070
01:33:32,583 --> 01:33:33,750
Yeah, what are you saying?

2071
01:33:33,750 --> 01:33:36,125
Yes, he was in love with Sofia,
his opposite house girl.

2072
01:33:36,125 --> 01:33:36,917
Sofia?

2073
01:33:36,917 --> 01:33:39,208
He hit her father
for your words.

2074
01:33:39,208 --> 01:33:42,375
Because of him, they got
 her married to someone.

2075
01:33:42,375 --> 01:33:44,875
Both Ashok's and
 the girl's lives are gone.

2076
01:33:44,875 --> 01:33:46,750
But till this day,
has he ever said...

2077
01:33:46,750 --> 01:33:48,208
... his life has gone
because of my father?

2078
01:33:48,208 --> 01:33:49,917
Some mistake has happened.

2079
01:33:49,917 --> 01:33:52,917
So, will you yell at him
and throw him out of the house?

2080
01:33:52,917 --> 01:33:54,542
Henceforth, he will not come
even if you plead.

2081
01:33:54,542 --> 01:33:56,042
I too will not come.

2082
01:33:56,042 --> 01:33:57,292
You stay in the house.

2083
01:33:57,292 --> 01:33:59,875
The one who got scoldings
 is eating, inside.

2084
01:33:59,875 --> 01:34:01,000
What's his problem?

2085
01:34:01,958 --> 01:34:03,250
Is he eating?

2086
01:34:03,250 --> 01:34:05,708
Oh, no! Why did he come now?

2087
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:08,292
Come and have food.

2088
01:34:08,292 --> 01:34:11,667
Hey, I was talking for you.

2089
01:34:11,667 --> 01:34:13,042
You're eating without shame.

2090
01:34:13,042 --> 01:34:13,792
Will you get food
if you feel shame?

2091
01:34:13,792 --> 01:34:14,208
Leave it.

2092
01:34:14,208 --> 01:34:15,542
Dad only scolded me.

2093
01:34:15,542 --> 01:34:16,208
Okay, come.

2094
01:34:17,167 --> 01:34:18,250
I won’t give.

2095
01:34:18,250 --> 01:34:18,958
Hey, uncle!

2096
01:34:18,958 --> 01:34:20,625
Don't you have sense?

2097
01:34:22,125 --> 01:34:24,000
Nothing like that is served.
Serve my gravy.

2098
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:25,750
That means?
-Tamarind gravy.

2099
01:34:25,750 --> 01:34:26,750
He will speak like a scientist.

2100
01:34:26,750 --> 01:34:27,833
Serve it.

2101
01:34:27,833 --> 01:34:28,875
Pour on his head.

2102
01:34:28,875 --> 01:34:30,708
It's good to die
 instead of eating like this.

2103
01:34:30,708 --> 01:34:32,458
Give me some.

2104
01:34:32,458 --> 01:34:34,083
Look him.

2105
01:34:34,083 --> 01:34:35,667
For this life...
-Is it Ponni rice?

2106
01:34:35,667 --> 01:34:36,875
Aren't you ashamed?

2107
01:34:36,875 --> 01:34:40,000
It's been four days since I ate.
-In this house, right?

2108
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:40,917
Serve me tamarind gravy.

2109
01:34:40,917 --> 01:34:43,292
She will serve.
Don't hurry.

2110
01:35:02,167 --> 01:35:02,875
Hello!

2111
01:35:03,542 --> 01:35:04,708
Echo is heard.

2112
01:35:04,708 --> 01:35:06,417
The tank is dredged.

2113
01:35:07,625 --> 01:35:09,458
Hey, bottle!
-Tell me.

2114
01:35:09,458 --> 01:35:10,208
Hey!

2115
01:35:10,208 --> 01:35:12,542
Oh, no! Why is she here?

2116
01:35:13,667 --> 01:35:15,708
Should she stop here?

2117
01:35:15,708 --> 01:35:17,625
In this bike, the tyre...

2118
01:35:22,917 --> 01:35:24,625
Hi! Are you doing good?

2119
01:35:24,625 --> 01:35:26,625
I was good, until seeing you.

2120
01:35:26,625 --> 01:35:28,167
The day I saw you,
 I lost my life.

2121
01:35:28,167 --> 01:35:28,750
Happy!

2122
01:35:30,083 --> 01:35:31,583
Wait.
Where are you leaving?

2123
01:35:31,583 --> 01:35:33,375
Just a jolly ride on bike...

2124
01:35:33,375 --> 01:35:36,125
Good, you had ruined my life
 and roaming happily.

2125
01:35:36,125 --> 01:35:39,208
Hey! Did I ruin?
-Yes, that's what your job is.

2126
01:35:39,208 --> 01:35:42,042
Saying something and
spoiling the good girl.

2127
01:35:42,042 --> 01:35:44,750
Don't utter the words spoil
and ruin, being on the road.

2128
01:35:44,750 --> 01:35:46,333
Don't the people
who heed you will mistake me?

2129
01:35:46,333 --> 01:35:49,250
What's there to mistake, still?
Everything is over.

2130
01:35:49,250 --> 01:35:51,333
Nothing is over.

2131
01:35:51,333 --> 01:35:53,917
I tried to do a good deed
and it turned bad.

2132
01:35:53,917 --> 01:35:56,125
Even now, I think I have
 to do something to you.

2133
01:35:56,125 --> 01:35:58,292
Tell me, if you're in love
with someone. I'll help you.

2134
01:35:58,292 --> 01:36:00,083
Don't you've any other work?

2135
01:36:00,708 --> 01:36:02,542
What should I do, now?
-You have to love.

2136
01:36:02,542 --> 01:36:04,000
Whom?
-Me.

2137
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:05,333
Don't you've any other work?

2138
01:36:05,333 --> 01:36:06,833
Are the existing problems
not enough?

2139
01:36:06,833 --> 01:36:07,625
Look here.

2140
01:36:08,292 --> 01:36:10,750
I don't love you
for being nice and talking well.

2141
01:36:10,750 --> 01:36:12,167
Then for what?

2142
01:36:12,167 --> 01:36:13,000
For the work you did...

2143
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,250
...some other girl would've
thrown acid on your face.

2144
01:36:16,083 --> 01:36:18,667
But, I understood that you've done
 all these for the sake of friendship.

2145
01:36:18,667 --> 01:36:20,458
Not only that, on that day,
 it was I who came with you...

2146
01:36:20,458 --> 01:36:22,542
...from the house
denying the marriage.

2147
01:36:22,542 --> 01:36:26,167
You took the blame on you
and got hit.

2148
01:36:26,167 --> 01:36:27,917
First, I made a decision,
said by my father.

2149
01:36:27,917 --> 01:36:29,792
Later, I made a decision,
 said by you.

2150
01:36:30,167 --> 01:36:31,250
Both went wrong.

2151
01:36:31,250 --> 01:36:32,500
It's you who said on that day...

2152
01:36:32,500 --> 01:36:35,750
Whatever others say, we must decide
 with whom should we live.

2153
01:36:35,750 --> 01:36:37,292
When thinking of it,

2154
01:36:37,292 --> 01:36:38,833
I know only you.

2155
01:36:38,833 --> 01:36:40,500
I saw only your kind heart.

2156
01:36:40,500 --> 01:36:42,250
So, I decided to love you.

2157
01:36:42,750 --> 01:36:44,792
You think well and
tell your decision tomorrow.

2158
01:36:44,792 --> 01:36:45,583
Hey, look here.

2159
01:36:45,583 --> 01:36:47,917
You're trying to speak
like me and confusing me.

2160
01:36:48,583 --> 01:36:51,417
Not only now, whenever I say,
my decision is the same.

2161
01:36:51,417 --> 01:36:53,083
I can't love you.

2162
01:36:53,083 --> 01:36:54,375
Then, say it tomorrow.

2163
01:36:54,708 --> 01:36:55,583
It's the same
even if I say tomorrow.

2164
01:36:55,583 --> 01:36:56,917
Say it, tomorrow.

2165
01:37:00,458 --> 01:37:01,958
Why are you leaving the bike?

2166
01:37:02,917 --> 01:37:04,917
Fuel dried up.
-Shall I drop you?

2167
01:37:05,208 --> 01:37:06,208
No need.

2168
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:12,792
Following a style even when sleeping.

2169
01:37:12,792 --> 01:37:14,292
He isn't attending the phone...

2170
01:37:18,542 --> 01:37:20,625
Ashok, I'm Sofia speaking.

2171
01:37:21,583 --> 01:37:23,625
I want to talk with you.

2172
01:37:24,167 --> 01:37:26,625
Will you come to the temple
on the mountain without informing Anand?

2173
01:37:28,667 --> 01:37:30,208
Okay, I'll tell Ashok.

2174
01:37:33,750 --> 01:37:37,125
Will your girlfriend talk
only at the temple on the mountain?

2175
01:37:38,667 --> 01:37:39,708
Whatever!

2176
01:37:43,333 --> 01:37:46,333
Ashok, his mother came
 to my house.

2177
01:37:46,958 --> 01:37:48,375
Why? What's the matter?

2178
01:37:48,917 --> 01:37:50,667
I'll come straight away
to the matter.

2179
01:37:51,542 --> 01:37:54,125
My son has been denying
 the marriage for two years...

2180
01:37:54,125 --> 01:37:55,833
...thinking of your daughter.

2181
01:37:56,708 --> 01:38:00,583
Now, we've spoke to him to our best
 and convinced for marriage.

2182
01:38:00,583 --> 01:38:02,125
We're looking for a bride too.

2183
01:38:02,625 --> 01:38:07,333
As your daughter came back,
again he started denying marriage.

2184
01:38:07,333 --> 01:38:09,083
I have only son.

2185
01:38:09,417 --> 01:38:12,750
Don't I wish to get him married?

2186
01:38:12,750 --> 01:38:15,625
Look here, don't mistake me.

2187
01:38:15,625 --> 01:38:20,083
If I buy something in my house,
 I'll buy new stuff.

2188
01:38:20,083 --> 01:38:21,875
Else, I'll not buy.

2189
01:38:22,083 --> 01:38:23,583
When that's the case,

2190
01:38:23,583 --> 01:38:28,250
I don't have the mindset of
getting my son married to a girl...

2191
01:38:28,250 --> 01:38:30,250
... who was married, already.

2192
01:38:30,250 --> 01:38:31,292
Pardone me.

2193
01:38:31,292 --> 01:38:35,375
My daughter haven't disturbed your son.

2194
01:38:35,375 --> 01:38:36,750
She didn't even look at him.

2195
01:38:37,542 --> 01:38:40,292
If you want to convey anything,
tell your son.

2196
01:38:40,500 --> 01:38:42,333
Already, we're badly hurt.

2197
01:38:42,333 --> 01:38:43,917
Don't bother us, more.

2198
01:38:45,125 --> 01:38:47,500
Get your son married
 to whoever you want.

2199
01:38:48,375 --> 01:38:49,333
You can leave.

2200
01:38:53,542 --> 01:38:56,958
My son will not get marry
until you're in this town.

2201
01:38:56,958 --> 01:38:57,833
Think well.

2202
01:39:02,917 --> 01:39:05,000
For that sake, does she want
you to leave this town?

2203
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:06,708
What she said is right.

2204
01:39:07,625 --> 01:39:09,042
If it's a city like Chennai...

2205
01:39:09,042 --> 01:39:11,375
...no one will bother,
what's happening in the next house.

2206
01:39:11,750 --> 01:39:14,292
In our hometown, everyone knows
 whatever happens in our house.

2207
01:39:15,542 --> 01:39:19,500
Who will wish her son to get married
to a woman who was married, already?

2208
01:39:20,875 --> 01:39:24,042
I've come to my father's house
 to feel little relieved.

2209
01:39:24,042 --> 01:39:26,292
Where do I go
if it bothers me here too?

2210
01:39:26,792 --> 01:39:28,167
What should I do now?

2211
01:39:28,167 --> 01:39:30,500
Tell him to marry someone
as his mother says.

2212
01:39:30,500 --> 01:39:34,250
Look here, my mother has no rights
 to tell you to leave this town.

2213
01:39:34,542 --> 01:39:37,583
The same way, you don't have
 any rights to tell me to get marry.

2214
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:39,917
Just answer to my query.

2215
01:39:39,917 --> 01:39:43,167
Would you leave me alone
 in this situation if I were you?

2216
01:39:43,167 --> 01:39:44,583
That's why, I said
I'll not talk with him.

2217
01:39:44,583 --> 01:39:46,583
Sofia, reply me.

2218
01:39:46,583 --> 01:39:48,083
Will you leave me alone?

2219
01:39:50,958 --> 01:39:52,375
That's different
and this is different.

2220
01:39:52,792 --> 01:39:54,375
We both aren't the same.

2221
01:39:54,375 --> 01:39:55,792
What's different?

2222
01:39:55,792 --> 01:39:59,000
The happiness and sadness
 are the same for both men and women.

2223
01:39:59,000 --> 01:39:59,792
What now?

2224
01:39:59,792 --> 01:40:01,208
I shouldn't come behind you, right?

2225
01:40:01,208 --> 01:40:02,500
I swear, I'll not come.

2226
01:40:03,667 --> 01:40:05,167
But no matter how many years,

2227
01:40:05,167 --> 01:40:07,292
Whoever leaves you,
I'll be there for you.

2228
01:40:07,292 --> 01:40:08,833
I'm the only one for you.

2229
01:40:08,833 --> 01:40:12,458
Ashok, that's why I called you
and told I want to speak with you alone.

2230
01:40:12,708 --> 01:40:15,542
You called me
but you said to him.

2231
01:40:15,833 --> 01:40:17,125
You are his friend, right?

2232
01:40:17,125 --> 01:40:18,625
He is blabbering.

2233
01:40:18,792 --> 01:40:20,583
Instead of getting him married
 to a good girl...

2234
01:40:20,583 --> 01:40:22,125
... you're dancing to his tunes.

2235
01:40:22,125 --> 01:40:26,292
If the parents look for a bride,
they will bother about others.

2236
01:40:26,292 --> 01:40:27,167
I'm his friend.

2237
01:40:27,167 --> 01:40:28,917
I'll look for what he likes.

2238
01:40:29,250 --> 01:40:31,250
You're his only girl in this world!

2239
01:40:31,250 --> 01:40:32,583
What can I do for it?

2240
01:40:36,542 --> 01:40:37,542
Sofia!

2241
01:40:42,958 --> 01:40:46,500
Did she bring us
 to the mountain to say this?

2242
01:40:59,208 --> 01:41:00,167
Why did you come here?

2243
01:41:00,500 --> 01:41:01,417
To talk with you.

2244
01:41:07,167 --> 01:41:09,917
I told you yesterday,
l can't love you.

2245
01:41:10,125 --> 01:41:11,792
What's the meaning
for denying me?

2246
01:41:11,792 --> 01:41:14,042
I told you many reasons
 why I like you.

2247
01:41:14,208 --> 01:41:16,208
You just tell me one reason
for not liking me.

2248
01:41:16,208 --> 01:41:17,625
Not one, I've many reasons.

2249
01:41:17,625 --> 01:41:19,250
First, you were the bride
 fixed for Anand.

2250
01:41:19,542 --> 01:41:21,125
Saying, I fell in love
with my friend's bride...

2251
01:41:21,125 --> 01:41:22,417
...everyone will yell at me.

2252
01:41:22,583 --> 01:41:25,125
Your relatives are furious on me.

2253
01:41:25,125 --> 01:41:27,208
It'll be a problem
 if they witness both of us talking.

2254
01:41:27,208 --> 01:41:28,542
You come this side.

2255
01:41:29,417 --> 01:41:31,708
The friendship between me
and Anand will be ruined.

2256
01:41:32,208 --> 01:41:33,042
That's all?

2257
01:41:33,208 --> 01:41:34,250
That's all for now.

2258
01:41:34,750 --> 01:41:38,375
Look here, Anand didn't
love me and so I.

2259
01:41:38,875 --> 01:41:42,125
It's meaningful of your thinking,
 if we had fallen in love with each other.

2260
01:41:42,417 --> 01:41:44,667
But, the first point
you said is damn cheap.

2261
01:41:45,292 --> 01:41:46,417
What did you say?

2262
01:41:46,417 --> 01:41:47,375
You mean, problems will arise.

2263
01:41:47,375 --> 01:41:49,000
If you're afraid of problems,

2264
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:50,000
As soon as I called...

2265
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:51,417
...you wouldn't have come
to my house and took me.

2266
01:41:51,417 --> 01:41:52,875
You said something else...

2267
01:41:53,208 --> 01:41:54,750
Because of love,
your friendship will be ruined.

2268
01:41:54,750 --> 01:41:57,208
True friendship will support
 the love.

2269
01:41:57,375 --> 01:41:58,750
Still you said one more..

2270
01:41:59,417 --> 01:42:01,458
As you fell in love with
 your friend's girlfriend...

2271
01:42:01,458 --> 01:42:02,625
...everyone will yell at you.

2272
01:42:03,250 --> 01:42:05,417
That's the only fact you said.

2273
01:42:05,917 --> 01:42:07,792
What's the fact?

2274
01:42:08,125 --> 01:42:09,625
I didn't do anything.

2275
01:42:09,625 --> 01:42:11,208
You didn't do deliberately.

2276
01:42:11,375 --> 01:42:12,333
But, it's like that.

2277
01:42:12,333 --> 01:42:13,417
Like that means...

2278
01:42:13,417 --> 01:42:15,708
Who kept the flex for my birthday
and gave me a chain?

2279
01:42:15,708 --> 01:42:16,875
That's for the sake of Anand.

2280
01:42:17,417 --> 01:42:19,958
You've sent poetry in WhatsApp,
 with me in your mind, isn't it?

2281
01:42:20,542 --> 01:42:22,042
Who wrote poetry
thinking of you?

2282
01:42:22,042 --> 01:42:23,625
I took that from Facebook.

2283
01:42:23,792 --> 01:42:25,958
Whatever I say,
you'll manage by your smart talk.

2284
01:42:26,625 --> 01:42:28,083
I'm not here to argue.

2285
01:42:28,583 --> 01:42:29,125
Take this.

2286
01:42:29,458 --> 01:42:30,792
What's this?

2287
01:42:30,792 --> 01:42:31,958
It's the chain you gave.

2288
01:42:32,333 --> 01:42:36,333
Bought it for your birthday,
you keep it.

2289
01:42:36,333 --> 01:42:37,500
It's not given by Anand.

2290
01:42:37,500 --> 01:42:38,417
You gave this chain.

2291
01:42:38,417 --> 01:42:40,042
If you say , you love me,
 I'll have it.

2292
01:42:40,042 --> 01:42:41,875
Else, why should I have
 someone's chain?

2293
01:42:42,125 --> 01:42:42,833
Tell me.

2294
01:42:46,375 --> 01:42:47,833
Give me, I'll have it.

2295
01:42:49,917 --> 01:42:52,250
Ashok, don't think just because
 I returned the chain,

2296
01:42:52,250 --> 01:42:54,917
Sorry, as you got it back,
don't think everything is over.

2297
01:42:54,917 --> 01:42:57,208
Even if you don't think of me,
I'll think of you.

2298
01:43:12,833 --> 01:43:14,958
I'm the reason for your stance.

2299
01:43:14,958 --> 01:43:17,458
Whatever happened,
 I should've got you married.

2300
01:43:17,458 --> 01:43:18,875
I don't want your mercy.

2301
01:43:19,542 --> 01:43:20,875
I've many people.

2302
01:43:20,875 --> 01:43:23,292
Instead of thinking the past,
take care of your life.

2303
01:43:23,292 --> 01:43:28,958
"Why are you refusing?"

2304
01:43:28,958 --> 01:43:34,875
"You too will get it "

2305
01:43:34,875 --> 01:43:47,500
"You're hiding,
But, you think of me"

2306
01:43:47,500 --> 01:43:53,958
"Something painful
Rubs my mind, lightly"

2307
01:43:53,958 --> 01:44:00,167
"To walk away from you
I could not do it..."

2308
01:44:00,167 --> 01:44:06,333
"Say when it is,
Like every other dawn"

2309
01:44:06,333 --> 01:44:12,875
"Fragmented inside,
You didn't seem to understand me"

2310
01:44:22,458 --> 01:44:24,208
He likes me.
-No, he likes me.

2311
01:44:24,208 --> 01:44:28,500
Will you like me or Kavya?

2312
01:44:28,500 --> 01:44:29,583
Tell me.

2313
01:44:29,583 --> 01:44:32,042
-Even if you don't think of me,
I'll think about you.

2314
01:44:33,417 --> 01:44:34,667
I don't like you both.
Get lost!

2315
01:44:34,667 --> 01:44:36,083
We too don't like you.
Go away.

2316
01:44:36,083 --> 01:44:37,208
Damn it, we asked you!

2317
01:44:37,208 --> 01:44:43,417
"Whichever bird crosses me,
that's your parody"

2318
01:44:43,417 --> 01:44:47,417
"What would I do without you?"

2319
01:44:47,417 --> 01:44:48,875
-Have you ever proposed me?

2320
01:44:49,625 --> 01:44:55,542
"The words you and I said,
Not even one was lost"

2321
01:44:55,542 --> 01:44:59,833
"I saved the wind in the house"

2322
01:44:59,833 --> 01:45:01,500
I can't stay even a day
without seeing you.

2323
01:45:01,500 --> 01:45:07,500
"The old days are killing me
 little by little..."

2324
01:45:07,500 --> 01:45:10,625
"Your visit is over my palm"

2325
01:45:10,625 --> 01:45:13,500
"Joins like a little feather"

2326
01:45:13,500 --> 01:45:25,875
"You made something within me"

2327
01:45:25,875 --> 01:45:37,500
"Who forgets?
Though aside, you're closer"

2328
01:45:38,792 --> 01:45:50,458
"Tell me, what are you thinking
 to do, still?"

2329
01:45:50,458 --> 01:46:02,958
"If you don't tell,
you will lose your love"

2330
01:46:16,667 --> 01:46:17,542
Hey, Kavya!

2331
01:46:17,958 --> 01:46:18,583
What?

2332
01:46:18,583 --> 01:46:20,000
I'm waiting for you.

2333
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:21,333
I know, tell me.

2334
01:46:21,583 --> 01:46:22,958
Then, you are moving on.

2335
01:46:23,208 --> 01:46:24,292
Stop me and say, if I go.

2336
01:46:24,292 --> 01:46:25,250
Nothing wrong.

2337
01:46:28,667 --> 01:46:29,500
Attitude.

2338
01:46:31,792 --> 01:46:33,500
I didn't do anything
to cheat you.

2339
01:46:33,500 --> 01:46:35,000
Look here, I know all those.

2340
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:35,917
Tell me, what you want
to say now?

2341
01:46:35,917 --> 01:46:39,042
No, if I say all these, I can
easily convey, what I want to.

2342
01:46:39,708 --> 01:46:40,583
Okay, tell me,

2343
01:46:41,583 --> 01:46:42,542
That is...

2344
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:47,625
When you came trusting me
and was cheated, I was hesitant.

2345
01:46:47,917 --> 01:46:51,167
When you conveyed your love,
 I don't know what to say.

2346
01:46:51,167 --> 01:46:52,667
I was confused.

2347
01:46:53,125 --> 01:46:56,583
I know well,
you're coming around me.

2348
01:46:56,958 --> 01:47:00,250
You might think,
I'm showing attitude.

2349
01:47:00,542 --> 01:47:01,917
Nothing like that.

2350
01:47:04,042 --> 01:47:06,542
I was just wondering
 what the problems will be...

2351
01:47:06,542 --> 01:47:07,917
...if we both are together.

2352
01:47:08,375 --> 01:47:11,917
How big a problem it would be
 for me, if we don't be together...

2353
01:47:12,167 --> 01:47:14,333
...It was only in these four days
 I realized, in your absence.

2354
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:16,083
Alright, so?

2355
01:47:19,708 --> 01:47:21,375
I don't know to convey
my love.

2356
01:47:21,625 --> 01:47:24,458
So, you understand.

2357
01:47:25,250 --> 01:47:26,250
So, that's all?

2358
01:47:26,708 --> 01:47:28,250
How to say in temple?
-This is how will you convey the love?

2359
01:47:28,500 --> 01:47:30,458
You kept a flex on that day...

2360
01:47:30,958 --> 01:47:32,458
That's a drama.

2361
01:47:32,625 --> 01:47:36,750
I can do only this
 for true love.

2362
01:47:37,542 --> 01:47:38,167
Then?

2363
01:47:38,750 --> 01:47:40,167
My mom is waiting.

2364
01:47:40,667 --> 01:47:41,333
I'm leaving.

2365
01:47:42,500 --> 01:47:43,208
Are you happy?

2366
01:48:00,708 --> 01:48:02,125
Past is past.

2367
01:48:02,125 --> 01:48:03,292
Don't talk about it.

2368
01:48:03,292 --> 01:48:05,375
It's good to proceed the marriage.

2369
01:48:05,375 --> 01:48:09,417
In-law, I wanted to celebrate
 my daughter's wedding.

2370
01:48:09,792 --> 01:48:11,500
But, something has happened.

2371
01:48:11,917 --> 01:48:15,500
You find an auspicious day
 for the wedding, this time.

2372
01:48:15,500 --> 01:48:17,083
Last time also, we've fixed
an auspicious day.

2373
01:48:17,083 --> 01:48:19,625
When elders are speaking,
 you're talking in between.

2374
01:48:19,833 --> 01:48:24,542
As yours is an honourable
 and great family,

2375
01:48:24,542 --> 01:48:25,833
I agreed for the wedding, immediately.

2376
01:48:25,833 --> 01:48:27,875
It was ashame when the marriage
 was stopped on that day.

2377
01:48:28,542 --> 01:48:30,125
Everyone was talking something.

2378
01:48:30,125 --> 01:48:31,875
That's why, this marriage
should happen.

2379
01:48:31,875 --> 01:48:34,958
If there is fault on my daughter,
 I wouldn't have come to talk with you.

2380
01:48:35,417 --> 01:48:38,167
Last time, some blind mistake
 has happened.

2381
01:48:38,375 --> 01:48:39,667
It will not happen this time.

2382
01:48:39,667 --> 01:48:40,667
If happened this time?

2383
01:48:41,958 --> 01:48:44,958
More than my life,
dignity is utmost important for me.

2384
01:48:44,958 --> 01:48:47,792
If it happens this time,

2385
01:48:47,792 --> 01:48:50,125
I'll not let anyone alive
 whoever is the reason for it...

2386
01:48:50,292 --> 01:48:52,833
... and I too will not be alive
after losing my dignity.

2387
01:48:52,833 --> 01:48:54,750
In-law, why are you talking, seriously?

2388
01:48:54,750 --> 01:48:56,500
We will proceed
the marriage, next week.

2389
01:48:56,792 --> 01:48:59,292
Let's do the marriage
 in the house, very simple.

2390
01:48:59,292 --> 01:49:01,208
Dad!
What are you saying?

2391
01:49:01,667 --> 01:49:03,833
Everyone knows that
 my marriage was stopped.

2392
01:49:04,042 --> 01:49:05,792
Once again, the marriage
 should be known to everyone.

2393
01:49:05,792 --> 01:49:06,750
Uncle!
-Son-in-law!

2394
01:49:06,958 --> 01:49:09,458
Do the marriage more grandeur
 than last time.

2395
01:49:09,458 --> 01:49:10,625
Glad, son-in-law.

2396
01:49:10,625 --> 01:49:11,958
Let's do it.

2397
01:49:13,167 --> 01:49:15,333
Last time, I was little careless.

2398
01:49:15,333 --> 01:49:17,000
I'll get my clan this time.

2399
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:18,083
You go, boldly.

2400
01:49:18,083 --> 01:49:19,333
Nothing wrong will happen.

2401
01:49:19,333 --> 01:49:21,042
I'll take care of that, son-in-law.

2402
01:49:21,042 --> 01:49:22,792
I'm leaving, in-law.
-Okay.

2403
01:49:23,792 --> 01:49:26,208
How much gold is he giving
for the bride?

2404
01:49:26,208 --> 01:49:27,125
Five hundred sovereigns.

2405
01:49:27,833 --> 01:49:30,542
Call him later
and ask for thousand sovereigns.

2406
01:49:30,542 --> 01:49:31,667
How is that possible?
-Oh, no!

2407
01:49:31,667 --> 01:49:34,750
The for what I told him,
he must do it more grandeur this time.

2408
01:49:34,750 --> 01:49:35,792
He will do.

2409
01:49:35,792 --> 01:49:37,125
If the bride elopes
the next time...

2410
01:49:37,125 --> 01:49:38,417
...shall we ask two thousand
sovereigns of gold?

2411
01:49:38,417 --> 01:49:39,875
Oh, god!
-You idiot.

2412
01:49:50,833 --> 01:49:52,167
Hey, what's this?

2413
01:49:52,167 --> 01:49:53,667
He is going with our girl.

2414
01:49:53,667 --> 01:49:55,375
She would've given him lift.

2415
01:49:55,375 --> 01:49:56,250
Lift?

2416
01:49:56,250 --> 01:49:59,542
He is leaning on her back.
Is it lift?

2417
01:49:59,542 --> 01:50:02,292
We would've finished him
 on the day the marriage was stopped.

2418
01:50:02,292 --> 01:50:05,750
Tell now, let us finish.

2419
01:50:05,750 --> 01:50:08,458
Just now, we went
to the bridegroom's house.

2420
01:50:08,458 --> 01:50:10,958
Having the marriage in a week,
we shouldn't do all these.

2421
01:50:10,958 --> 01:50:12,458
What to do him, now?

2422
01:50:16,125 --> 01:50:19,333
Welcome, uncle.
-Be seated, dude.

2423
01:50:19,333 --> 01:50:20,208
It's okay, uncle.

2424
01:50:20,208 --> 01:50:21,500
Be seated, son-in-law.

2425
01:50:22,125 --> 01:50:23,125
Okay.

2426
01:50:24,667 --> 01:50:25,833
You too sit down, dear.

2427
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:31,583
Dear, you know well about
the stance that led to look for...

2428
01:50:31,583 --> 01:50:33,375
...a bridegroom out of the family for Kavya.

2429
01:50:33,375 --> 01:50:34,333
I know well, brother.

2430
01:50:35,667 --> 01:50:38,292
I longed, she must come
 to my house.

2431
01:50:38,292 --> 01:50:39,292
That didn't happen.

2432
01:50:39,292 --> 01:50:42,292
It will happen to whoever
is gifted.

2433
01:50:42,292 --> 01:50:44,708
Anand must be disappointed
on me.

2434
01:50:44,708 --> 01:50:46,292
Uncle, I forgot everything
on that day.

2435
01:50:47,375 --> 01:50:51,292
I was worried when Kavya's marriage
was stopped because of me, last time.

2436
01:50:51,292 --> 01:50:52,250
Yes, brother.

2437
01:50:53,625 --> 01:50:55,583
It's enough if Kavya
gets a good life.

2438
01:50:55,583 --> 01:50:57,083
That's the wish of everyone.

2439
01:50:57,083 --> 01:50:59,042
As nothing shouldn't happen
 like last time,

2440
01:50:59,042 --> 01:51:00,417
Now. we are doing everything, carefully.

2441
01:51:00,417 --> 01:51:02,167
What happened last time
 was an accident.

2442
01:51:02,750 --> 01:51:05,792
Ashok did so,
 thinking he is doing me favour.

2443
01:51:05,792 --> 01:51:08,167
This time, nothing will happen, uncle.

2444
01:51:08,167 --> 01:51:10,083
I'll do this marriage.

2445
01:51:10,083 --> 01:51:12,542
That's what I too
want to say, son-in-law.

2446
01:51:12,542 --> 01:51:14,917
I feel happy as you said
 on your own.

2447
01:51:14,917 --> 01:51:16,375
I feel courageous, now.

2448
01:51:16,958 --> 01:51:20,042
Put a word to Ashok also.
-Uncle, I'll tell Ashok.

2449
01:51:20,042 --> 01:51:20,917
Good, son-in-law.

2450
01:51:22,583 --> 01:51:27,792
Son-in-law, if any problem arise
 in this marriage, I'll not be alive.

2451
01:51:27,792 --> 01:51:29,875
Uncle, why are you
getting emotional?

2452
01:51:29,875 --> 01:51:31,833
This marriage will happen
 as you've planned.

2453
01:51:31,833 --> 01:51:32,917
I'm responsible for that.

2454
01:51:33,917 --> 01:51:34,958
Good, son-in-law.

2455
01:51:36,875 --> 01:51:38,542
Okay.

2456
01:51:38,542 --> 01:51:39,042
I won!

2457
01:51:39,042 --> 01:51:40,625
Is he telling, really?

2458
01:51:40,625 --> 01:51:42,500
Are you hiding any card?

2459
01:51:42,500 --> 01:51:43,333
You keep on winning.

2460
01:51:43,333 --> 01:51:45,583
Should I play, cheating you?

2461
01:51:45,583 --> 01:51:46,958
Hereafter, I'll win.

2462
01:51:46,958 --> 01:51:49,667
An attitude is visible
 in your talk.

2463
01:51:49,667 --> 01:51:51,833
When it wasn't there?

2464
01:51:51,833 --> 01:51:53,708
Today night is my treat.

2465
01:51:53,708 --> 01:51:54,792
Treat?
Where?

2466
01:51:54,792 --> 01:51:56,667
Instead of asking why,
 he is asking where?

2467
01:51:56,667 --> 01:51:59,667
He is ashaming us too.

2468
01:51:59,667 --> 01:52:00,875
What's that query
 you ask, uncle?

2469
01:52:00,875 --> 01:52:02,500
Okay, leave it.
why?

2470
01:52:02,500 --> 01:52:04,500
I'll tell after Anand arrives.
-Then, he will not tell us.

2471
01:52:04,500 --> 01:52:05,792
Your treat is okay.

2472
01:52:05,792 --> 01:52:08,333
Win the Kabaddi match, tomorrow.
I'll give you treat.

2473
01:52:08,333 --> 01:52:09,375
You mean, the boiled egg?

2474
01:52:09,375 --> 01:52:11,083
Hey, tomorrow is Saturday.

2475
01:52:11,083 --> 01:52:12,292
Then, not that too.

2476
01:52:12,750 --> 01:52:15,500
Come, Anand.
We are waiting for you.

2477
01:52:15,500 --> 01:52:17,417
I must talk about
an important matter with you.

2478
01:52:17,417 --> 01:52:18,292
Be seated, first.

2479
01:52:18,292 --> 01:52:20,083
I must also talk about
 an important matter with you.

2480
01:52:20,083 --> 01:52:20,708
What?

2481
01:52:23,042 --> 01:52:24,167
He feels shy.

2482
01:52:24,167 --> 01:52:26,875
Hey, you don't feel shy.
I too feel shy.

2483
01:52:26,875 --> 01:52:27,875
Please, tell us.

2484
01:52:27,875 --> 01:52:30,833
I'm in love with a girl.

2485
01:52:30,833 --> 01:52:31,667
Who is that girl?

2486
01:52:31,667 --> 01:52:32,583
Kavya!

2487
01:52:33,792 --> 01:52:34,625
Which Kavya?

2488
01:52:35,208 --> 01:52:36,333
What, dude?

2489
01:52:36,333 --> 01:52:37,542
Your uncle's daughter.

2490
01:52:38,250 --> 01:52:39,458
Don't play.

2491
01:52:40,625 --> 01:52:41,875
Making fun of everything.

2492
01:52:41,875 --> 01:52:44,000
Hey, I'm telling you, seriously.

2493
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,458
We both are in love
 with each other.

2494
01:52:46,458 --> 01:52:49,708
Hey, she is getting married
next week.

2495
01:52:49,708 --> 01:52:51,583
Just now, uncle came home
 and told us.

2496
01:52:51,583 --> 01:52:52,583
What is he doing, Appachi?

2497
01:52:52,583 --> 01:52:53,875
I swear, I'm not aware of it.

2498
01:52:53,875 --> 01:52:56,583
Last time, Kavya's marriage
was stopped because of us.

2499
01:52:56,583 --> 01:52:58,625
My uncle was more humiliated.

2500
01:52:58,625 --> 01:53:00,375
It wouldn't be good,
 if anything happens again.

2501
01:53:00,375 --> 01:53:04,167
I promised him,
 I'll take care of this marriage.

2502
01:53:04,167 --> 01:53:05,250
What are you talking?

2503
01:53:05,250 --> 01:53:08,083
I said, we both are in love
with each other.

2504
01:53:08,083 --> 01:53:10,708
You talk about your word to uncle.

2505
01:53:10,708 --> 01:53:12,292
Appachi, why is he talking
without understanding?

2506
01:53:12,292 --> 01:53:16,083
Look, I came upstairs
 to play cards.

2507
01:53:16,083 --> 01:53:18,042
Both of you will fight
and re-join.

2508
01:53:18,042 --> 01:53:19,750
Why are you dragging me in this?

2509
01:53:19,750 --> 01:53:21,333
You just gave him a word, right?
Take it back.

2510
01:53:21,333 --> 01:53:23,000
What are you talking
without understanding anything?

2511
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:24,375
He is my maternal uncle.

2512
01:53:24,375 --> 01:53:26,667
I've promised before
the whole family.

2513
01:53:26,667 --> 01:53:28,792
If anything happens in this marriage,
it's a shame for me.

2514
01:53:29,583 --> 01:53:31,708
How many times to ashame
the bride's parents?

2515
01:53:31,708 --> 01:53:33,500
Hey, I didn't do this, intentionally.

2516
01:53:33,500 --> 01:53:37,250
She told, she loves me.
I too like her.

2517
01:53:37,250 --> 01:53:40,292
Leave all those.
Leave her for my sake.

2518
01:53:40,292 --> 01:53:41,250
Hey, it's love!

2519
01:53:41,250 --> 01:53:43,750
Can you understand what I say?
-I can understand well.

2520
01:53:43,750 --> 01:53:47,042
You think only about yourself.
Not thinking about those two families.

2521
01:53:47,917 --> 01:53:50,542
How many times will the family
of the bridegroom get ashamed?

2522
01:53:50,542 --> 01:53:53,125
Upon humiliation, if my uncle
 does anything, what will you do?

2523
01:53:53,125 --> 01:53:54,792
If Kavya does anything,
what will you do?

2524
01:53:54,792 --> 01:53:55,875
Her parents will take care of her.

2525
01:53:55,875 --> 01:53:57,292
I can't be a spectator,
 thinking my lovelady...

2526
01:53:57,292 --> 01:53:59,583
... will be taken care
 by parents or others.

2527
01:53:59,583 --> 01:54:01,917
The same way, I can't be quiet
 looking my uncle being humiliated.

2528
01:54:01,917 --> 01:54:02,708
What will you do?

2529
01:54:02,708 --> 01:54:04,583
Just now, both of you
are exchanging the message.

2530
01:54:04,583 --> 01:54:06,917
Why are you furious?
Speak politely.

2531
01:54:06,917 --> 01:54:08,583
Hey, bottle.
Be quiet.

2532
01:54:08,583 --> 01:54:11,042
When I abducted the girl for his sake,
don't I know to abduct for me?

2533
01:54:11,042 --> 01:54:12,167
Appachi, his way of talking
 isn't right.

2534
01:54:12,167 --> 01:54:13,167
Ask him to leave from here.

2535
01:54:13,167 --> 01:54:15,125
What did I say wrong?

2536
01:54:15,125 --> 01:54:16,458
I'm talking in right sense.

2537
01:54:16,458 --> 01:54:18,833
Whoever hinders,
 I'll abduct the girl...

2538
01:54:18,833 --> 01:54:21,583
Will you abduct her over me?
-I'll do.

2539
01:54:21,583 --> 01:54:22,333
Hey, wait.

2540
01:54:22,333 --> 01:54:25,042
Both of you speak politely.
You are piling up the words.

2541
01:54:25,042 --> 01:54:26,792
Appachi, ask them.

2542
01:54:26,792 --> 01:54:29,042
Having the match tomorrow,
 why are you quarrelling?

2543
01:54:29,042 --> 01:54:31,167
That's very important.
Useless match.

2544
01:54:31,167 --> 01:54:34,042
Anand, I gave word to Kasi
before you.

2545
01:54:34,042 --> 01:54:36,042
What to reply him,
 if he asks?

2546
01:54:36,042 --> 01:54:37,875
Appachi, I must win
 the match, right?

2547
01:54:37,875 --> 01:54:40,083
Whoever comes or not,
 I'll win the match.

2548
01:54:40,083 --> 01:54:41,625
Oh, he will win?

2549
01:54:41,625 --> 01:54:42,375
Who is he?
-Anand!

2550
01:54:42,375 --> 01:54:43,250
Hey, get lost.
 Call him.

2551
01:54:43,250 --> 01:54:43,958
Anand!

2552
01:54:43,958 --> 01:54:45,208
Anand!
-He is making fun, now.

2553
01:54:45,208 --> 01:54:45,792
Ashok!

2554
01:54:45,792 --> 01:54:46,708
Dude!

2555
01:54:46,708 --> 01:54:47,208
Appachi, stay quiet.

2556
01:54:48,875 --> 01:54:51,167
Wonder, what will be the problem
 in today's marriage?

2557
01:54:51,167 --> 01:54:52,875
Tonight is the Kabaddi match.

2558
01:54:52,875 --> 01:54:54,000
He is enraged and standing here.

2559
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:55,500
Hey, you speak to him.

2560
01:54:55,500 --> 01:54:59,583
Anand, there is no mistake on Ashok.

2561
01:54:59,583 --> 01:55:01,583
Your uncle's daughter chased him
 and fell in love.

2562
01:55:01,583 --> 01:55:02,958
He denied her.

2563
01:55:02,958 --> 01:55:06,708
She spoke some logics, changed
his mind and convinced him.

2564
01:55:06,708 --> 01:55:09,500
Not only that, last time she came
 trusting him and was disappointed.

2565
01:55:09,500 --> 01:55:11,042
How, if you don't understand?

2566
01:55:11,042 --> 01:55:13,417
Why everyone is talking for him?

2567
01:55:13,417 --> 01:55:15,250
When he asked me to buy
the garland and mangalsutra...

2568
01:55:15,250 --> 01:55:16,583
...would I've asked him a word, that day?

2569
01:55:16,583 --> 01:55:18,000
I bought on my own.

2570
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:22,000
You too yelled at him.
Did I scold him?

2571
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:25,333
Please understand, if I'm talking
 against this love, today.

2572
01:55:25,333 --> 01:55:28,458
You think only about yourselves.
I'm thinking about the two families.

2573
01:55:28,458 --> 01:55:29,833
Not that...

2574
01:55:29,833 --> 01:55:34,542
Look here, if you wish we both should fight,
you bring him to the wedding hall.

2575
01:55:34,542 --> 01:55:37,792
Else, talk something
and make him to sit there.

2576
01:55:37,792 --> 01:55:38,875
Let's bring him.

2577
01:55:38,875 --> 01:55:40,167
Uncle, don't go that way.

2578
01:55:40,167 --> 01:55:40,875
His uncle will be sitting.

2579
01:55:40,875 --> 01:55:41,458
Come on.

2580
01:55:41,458 --> 01:55:43,042
Always going to eat
 as soon as you arrive.

2581
01:55:43,042 --> 01:55:44,333
Are you fasting?

2582
01:55:45,125 --> 01:55:48,542
On behalf of 'Ambal Kabaddi team',
Owner of 'Power star team'...

2583
01:55:48,542 --> 01:55:51,667
... Power Pandi is honoured
by cladding a shawl.

2584
01:55:54,333 --> 01:55:58,417
'Kasi Warriors team', plays today
with Anand and Ashok as players.

2585
01:55:58,417 --> 01:56:00,292
In opposite team,
Ashok is not in the field.

2586
01:56:00,292 --> 01:56:02,708
He shouldn't enter the town also.
-I'll take care, dude.

2587
01:56:02,708 --> 01:56:05,833
Because of Ashok's absence,
Kasi brother feels panic.

2588
01:56:05,833 --> 01:56:10,125
Offence king, Anand takes up
 the raid as first player.

2589
01:56:10,125 --> 01:56:13,000
Though seven players are there
 in the opposite team,

2590
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:15,833
Anand will score points, cleverly.

2591
01:56:15,833 --> 01:56:17,750
Kabaddi...

2592
01:56:17,750 --> 01:56:20,458
Just now I said,
 he has scored the point.

2593
01:56:20,458 --> 01:56:22,417
Lion cub.
Hey!

2594
01:56:27,417 --> 01:56:33,125
From 'Power Star team', the Tamil Nadu
Police team Captain, Abdul will play now.

2595
01:56:33,833 --> 01:56:36,458
Abdul will rock the game.

2596
01:56:38,583 --> 01:56:40,792
Though Kasi brother's team
is strong on offence...

2597
01:56:40,792 --> 01:56:42,958
... it's little weak on defence.

2598
01:56:42,958 --> 01:56:45,458
A nice score by Abdul.

2599
01:56:45,458 --> 01:56:48,375
Pandi brother laughs, cutely.

2600
01:56:48,375 --> 01:56:51,958
Appachi, Ashok didn't come.
Shall I call him?

2601
01:56:51,958 --> 01:56:55,125
Will he come if you call?
Wait, let me call.

2602
01:56:56,875 --> 01:57:00,042
Hey, stop.
Where are you going?

2603
01:57:00,042 --> 01:57:01,083
To play the match, boss.

2604
01:57:01,083 --> 01:57:02,292
What?
For match?

2605
01:57:02,292 --> 01:57:05,458
You've to play in your hometown.
Why are you coming here?

2606
01:57:05,458 --> 01:57:09,958
I'll play, everywhere.
I'm in frustration.

2607
01:57:09,958 --> 01:57:11,042
I warn you
to leave the way.

2608
01:57:11,042 --> 01:57:14,833
He is frustrated!
First, play with us.

2609
01:57:14,833 --> 01:57:17,042
Then, you can go to
the town and play.

2610
01:57:30,958 --> 01:57:34,583
I think, he is coming by bike.
That's why not attending the call.

2611
01:57:34,583 --> 01:57:35,833
He'll come.

2612
01:57:35,833 --> 01:57:43,417
Chinna thambi from Sellur
is coming to the field, majestically.

2613
01:57:43,417 --> 01:57:45,625
He can't be tackled
even by Bahubali.

2614
01:57:45,625 --> 01:57:48,125
He has dragged everyone.

2615
01:57:51,167 --> 01:57:56,333
Kasi, you said, two people
will come and win the cup.

2616
01:57:56,333 --> 01:57:58,375
One of them is not seen
 in the field.

2617
01:57:58,375 --> 01:57:59,917
Did he flee out of fear?

2618
01:57:59,917 --> 01:58:01,958
Hey, be quiet.

2619
01:58:01,958 --> 01:58:03,458
He will come.

2620
01:58:24,250 --> 01:58:26,667
Kasi brother's team is
losing the points.

2621
01:58:26,667 --> 01:58:30,292
Though the offence is strong,
defence is weak.

2622
01:58:34,208 --> 01:58:38,125
Appachi, if we lose this time,
I'll lose my honour.

2623
01:58:38,125 --> 01:58:39,958
Can't live in the hometown
 with dignity.

2624
01:58:39,958 --> 01:58:42,708
Don't talk inauspiciously.
Somehow, Ashok will come.

2625
01:58:42,708 --> 01:58:46,458
He is a playful guy.
But will not take for granted.

2626
01:59:06,417 --> 01:59:10,750
It's said, the match is between
 the 'Kasi team' and 'Power Pandi' team.

2627
01:59:10,750 --> 01:59:14,625
But Anand alone is playing
against the 'Power Pandi team'.

2628
01:59:14,625 --> 01:59:18,000
We had never seen
 Anand playing so furiously.

2629
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:20,417
Single handedly, he is recovering
 the lost points.

2630
01:59:29,417 --> 01:59:33,167
Anand is the only challenge
 for 'Power Pandi team' to win.

2631
01:59:33,167 --> 01:59:36,542
They're playing madly
to catch Anand.

2632
01:59:36,542 --> 01:59:44,042
Kabaddi...

2633
02:00:10,292 --> 02:00:13,292
Don't know whether
they're playing Kabbadi or bull baiting.

2634
02:00:13,292 --> 02:00:15,083
They are playing like
catching a bull.

2635
02:00:15,083 --> 02:00:16,208
They've tackled him.

2636
02:00:16,208 --> 02:00:20,708
Kabaddi...

2637
02:00:20,708 --> 02:00:22,917
I expected!

2638
02:00:22,917 --> 02:00:24,750
The Power team has shown
 their damn job.

2639
02:00:24,750 --> 02:00:27,917
First aid, check what happened
 to the player.

2640
02:00:27,917 --> 02:00:29,167
Oh, no!
Go soon.

2641
02:00:30,208 --> 02:00:32,542
Bring him aside.

2642
02:00:32,542 --> 02:00:34,417
Intentionally, they are playing foul.

2643
02:00:45,292 --> 02:00:49,125
Wow! Already defence is weak.
Now, the offence has become weak.

2644
02:00:49,125 --> 02:00:50,417
Everything is over.

2645
02:00:50,417 --> 02:00:52,500
Kasi brother's team is tumbling
 like pack of cards.

2646
02:00:52,500 --> 02:00:55,083
As usual, Kasi brother's team
 is getting defeated and losing the points.

2647
02:00:56,833 --> 02:00:58,625
The time is going on.

2648
02:01:10,167 --> 02:01:13,792
Kasi, don't worry.
Ashok will come.

2649
02:01:13,792 --> 02:01:17,500
The first half is going to end.
What to do, if he comes hereafter?

2650
02:01:17,500 --> 02:01:19,667
Appachi, why did I give you the document
without taking money?

2651
02:01:19,667 --> 02:01:21,333
Because of the trust
I had on you.

2652
02:01:21,333 --> 02:01:22,292
Did you keep up that?

2653
02:01:22,875 --> 02:01:25,542
Appachi, you've strangled me
for trusting you.

2654
02:01:26,208 --> 02:01:27,917
Kasi...

2655
02:01:27,917 --> 02:01:31,292
The 'Power Pandi team' is leading
in first half of the match.

2656
02:01:31,292 --> 02:01:33,000
Half time.
Side change.

2657
02:01:40,542 --> 02:01:43,917
Ashok, who was expected by all
has entered the field.

2658
02:01:45,708 --> 02:01:49,417
First time, we're watching Ashok
and Anand playing in the same team.

2659
02:01:49,417 --> 02:01:50,208
How did he come?

2660
02:01:50,208 --> 02:01:52,000
If you're dare enough,
Play against them.

2661
02:02:17,917 --> 02:02:20,042
There is no player for defence.
This time also we will lose the cup.

2662
02:02:20,042 --> 02:02:21,417
Brother, what are you doing here?
-What?

2663
02:02:21,417 --> 02:02:22,250
Ashok came.

2664
02:02:22,250 --> 02:02:26,708
The Pandi team is panicking
and struggling to play.

2665
02:02:26,708 --> 02:02:28,083
What are you saying?

2666
02:02:37,083 --> 02:02:40,292
When thinking everything is over,
the game begins now.

2667
02:02:40,292 --> 02:02:44,625
Come on, boys!
Excellent!

2668
02:02:44,625 --> 02:02:46,208
Appachi, are they rocking?

2669
02:02:46,208 --> 02:02:47,583
Go aside.
-Okay, leave it..

2670
02:02:52,167 --> 02:02:56,292
You provoked Anand, isn't it?
Meet his toughness.

2671
02:02:56,292 --> 02:02:58,250
This is what comeback is!

2672
02:02:58,250 --> 02:03:00,917
Look, how he has settled the score?

2673
02:03:00,917 --> 02:03:07,167
Kabaddi...

2674
02:03:21,625 --> 02:03:24,167
Excellent!

2675
02:03:27,333 --> 02:03:30,750
The Power Pandi team played the first half
 of the match on the ground.

2676
02:03:30,750 --> 02:03:33,250
Now, swaying on air in the second half.

2677
02:03:33,250 --> 02:03:35,833
Only now, the match is furious.

2678
02:04:00,500 --> 02:04:03,292
The 'Power Pandi team'
has lost the power.

2679
02:04:03,292 --> 02:04:05,833
Power Pandi brother's face
was flattened.

2680
02:04:08,917 --> 02:04:14,208
Abdul, the 'star of hope'
of 'Power Pandi team' is taking the raid.

2681
02:04:14,208 --> 02:04:17,000
Let's see, whether he scores or not.

2682
02:04:34,708 --> 02:04:37,083
If Abdul is lifted, the 'Power Pandi team'
 will lose on the whole.

2683
02:04:37,083 --> 02:04:39,583
They did it before I finished.

2684
02:04:41,500 --> 02:04:43,333
The match is over.

2685
02:04:43,333 --> 02:04:47,083
As no one expected,
 like England won the cup...

2686
02:04:47,083 --> 02:04:47,917
...for the first time,

2687
02:04:47,917 --> 02:04:51,625
Kasi brother's team has won the cup.

2688
02:04:52,875 --> 02:04:54,250
They've rocked it, Appachi.

2689
02:04:54,250 --> 02:04:55,417
Excellent!

2690
02:04:55,458 --> 02:04:57,458
We have won the match!
We have won the cup!

2691
02:04:57,458 --> 02:04:59,875
Excellent!
-Everyone has played well.

2692
02:05:09,708 --> 02:05:11,958
Appachi, thank you very much.

2693
02:05:11,958 --> 02:05:13,000
You got me the cup.

2694
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:14,792
You've hurt me by words.
Can you take those words back?

2695
02:05:14,792 --> 02:05:16,333
It's my mistake.
Forgive me, Appachi.

2696
02:05:16,625 --> 02:05:20,667
Was there any day where you both
 didn't fight from your childhood?

2697
02:05:20,667 --> 02:05:22,708
If someone steps to convince you,
 both of you together...

2698
02:05:22,708 --> 02:05:23,958
...will make him to run away.

2699
02:05:23,958 --> 02:05:25,708
I've seen you both
like that from your childhood.

2700
02:05:25,708 --> 02:05:26,625
Has he drunk?

2701
02:05:26,625 --> 02:05:28,500
Ashok, I know you will come.

2702
02:05:28,833 --> 02:05:30,833
But, I got panicked, today.

2703
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:35,250
Appachi, I came not to let others
 win over my ancestral house.

2704
02:05:35,417 --> 02:05:36,167
I'm leaving.

2705
02:05:36,167 --> 02:05:37,458
Hey!

2706
02:05:37,750 --> 02:05:38,625
Ashok!

2707
02:05:38,625 --> 02:05:40,208
Hey!
-He has left!

2708
02:05:40,417 --> 02:05:42,208
Where is Anand?
-He too left!

2709
02:05:42,208 --> 02:05:43,542
They left half an hour before.

2710
02:05:43,542 --> 02:05:46,250
Come, let's go home, booze and sleep.
-That's also right.

2711
02:05:46,250 --> 02:05:47,792
Come on, Appachi.

2712
02:05:47,792 --> 02:05:51,125
Many vehicles are coming!

2713
02:05:51,875 --> 02:05:53,375
Brother, who are these people?

2714
02:05:53,375 --> 02:05:55,833
Dude, all belong to our clan.
-Get down.

2715
02:05:55,833 --> 02:05:57,542
Take your things.

2716
02:05:58,750 --> 02:06:00,000
Uncle, why are these people coming?

2717
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:02,750
Son-in-law, Ashok can be your friend.

2718
02:06:02,750 --> 02:06:04,833
But, he is not good like you.

2719
02:06:04,833 --> 02:06:07,292
He might do anything
to stop this marriage.

2720
02:06:07,292 --> 02:06:09,208
I'm here, uncle.
 I'll take care.

2721
02:06:09,208 --> 02:06:10,333
Not that, son-in-law.

2722
02:06:10,333 --> 02:06:12,292
It shouldn't happen like last time.

2723
02:06:12,292 --> 02:06:14,375
We too should be ready
 for everything.

2724
02:06:15,042 --> 02:06:17,083
Greetings, sir!
-Welcome, dude.

2725
02:06:17,083 --> 02:06:18,125
Greetings, brother.

2726
02:06:18,958 --> 02:06:20,167
Looks terrific.

2727
02:06:20,167 --> 02:06:23,958
Kavya, I don't bother who is there
 with your father.

2728
02:06:23,958 --> 02:06:25,458
Tomorrow, whatever problem arises,
I'll take care.

2729
02:06:25,458 --> 02:06:27,208
It's not like last time.

2730
02:06:27,208 --> 02:06:29,292
Anand too is supporting my father.

2731
02:06:29,292 --> 02:06:30,625
I'm very much afraid.

2732
02:06:30,625 --> 02:06:32,875
Whoever hinders, I'll come
to the marriage hall, tomorrow.

2733
02:06:33,250 --> 02:06:34,708
Your marriage will happen with me.

2734
02:06:34,708 --> 02:06:35,708
Go and sleep.

2735
02:06:37,708 --> 02:06:39,542
Dear, give me the phone.

2736
02:06:39,542 --> 02:06:40,250
Dad!

2737
02:06:40,250 --> 02:06:41,125
Give it.

2738
02:06:41,125 --> 02:06:41,917
That is...

2739
02:06:43,417 --> 02:06:44,750
Take back after the marriage.

2740
02:06:45,625 --> 02:06:46,917
Hey, break that phone.

2741
02:06:49,167 --> 02:06:51,875
As my uncle wished, it's enough
 if the marriage happens well.

2742
02:06:51,875 --> 02:06:53,542
Anand, Ashok has come.

2743
02:06:54,833 --> 02:06:56,333
How many have
 accompanied him?

2744
02:06:56,333 --> 02:06:57,833
He came alone.
-Alone?

2745
02:06:57,833 --> 02:06:58,667
Hey, come on.

2746
02:07:06,833 --> 02:07:08,167
Move away.

2747
02:07:27,792 --> 02:07:28,917
Brother, stop.

2748
02:07:31,458 --> 02:07:33,042
Why have you come here?

2749
02:07:33,250 --> 02:07:35,458
It's not important to do
the marriage, grandeur.

2750
02:07:35,458 --> 02:07:36,958
Without the willing of the bride,
 you shouldn't do the marriage.

2751
02:07:36,958 --> 02:07:37,958
We too know that.

2752
02:07:37,958 --> 02:07:39,750
We are doing this marriage
 on the willingness of the bride.

2753
02:07:39,750 --> 02:07:41,000
Go and look after your work.

2754
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:42,250
You shouldn't say that.

2755
02:07:42,250 --> 02:07:43,292
Let Kavya say it.

2756
02:07:43,792 --> 02:07:45,000
I'm telling you...

2757
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:46,917
Hey, he is saying...

2758
02:07:46,917 --> 02:07:48,292
But, you're going inside.
Go out.

2759
02:07:48,292 --> 02:07:49,708
I'll take care.
-Why are you sprinkling rose water?

2760
02:07:49,708 --> 02:07:52,167
Anand, he has come
to create issue in the marriage.

2761
02:07:52,167 --> 02:07:53,458
Don't let him inside.

2762
02:07:53,458 --> 02:07:54,708
Hey, leave.

2763
02:07:55,000 --> 02:07:56,583
Wait, I said I'll speak to him.

2764
02:07:57,333 --> 02:07:58,417
Why are you staring?

2765
02:07:58,417 --> 02:08:01,583
Anand, he is nothing.
I'm considering for your sake.

2766
02:08:01,583 --> 02:08:02,458
Ask him to leave.

2767
02:08:02,458 --> 02:08:03,875
I'll talk to him.
Leave it.

2768
02:08:04,083 --> 02:08:06,625
Dude, he must be banged...

2769
02:08:06,625 --> 02:08:08,250
I'm telling you....

2770
02:08:14,167 --> 02:08:14,917
Stop it.

2771
02:08:14,917 --> 02:08:17,042
For his sake, you're banging
our guys.

2772
02:08:17,042 --> 02:08:18,667
He is watching it.

2773
02:08:18,667 --> 02:08:20,417
Can we fight among ourselves
 for someone else?

2774
02:08:20,417 --> 02:08:22,250
I told them not to touch him.
They aren't listening me.

2775
02:08:22,250 --> 02:08:27,708
Good! It's good that your uncle
trusted you and you're doing this.

2776
02:08:27,708 --> 02:08:28,583
Did he trust me?

2777
02:08:29,458 --> 02:08:31,292
He never trusted me.

2778
02:08:32,250 --> 02:08:34,083
I was brought up before him.

2779
02:08:34,083 --> 02:08:36,250
On that day, when his elder son-in-law
 said something wrong about me...

2780
02:08:36,250 --> 02:08:37,792
...He didn't trust me and
denied my marriage.

2781
02:08:37,792 --> 02:08:38,792
Even that's okay.

2782
02:08:38,792 --> 02:08:41,208
Today, though I said,
he brought a clan.

2783
02:08:41,417 --> 02:08:43,000
Is this the trust he has
on me?

2784
02:08:43,500 --> 02:08:45,792
Do you think
he has come alone?

2785
02:08:45,792 --> 02:08:47,375
He came with confidence
that I'm here.

2786
02:08:47,375 --> 02:08:49,708
I don't know what he do
is right or wrong.

2787
02:08:49,708 --> 02:08:51,375
No body should touch him
 in my presence.

2788
02:08:51,375 --> 02:08:52,500
I'll not let anyone to touch.

2789
02:08:52,875 --> 02:08:54,750
What are you talking?

2790
02:08:54,750 --> 02:08:56,333
It's just a friendship.

2791
02:08:56,333 --> 02:08:59,542
But, we are your kith and kin.

2792
02:08:59,542 --> 02:09:01,625
Is he important than us?

2793
02:09:01,625 --> 02:09:03,708
If we get married within families,
 everyone will become relatives.

2794
02:09:03,917 --> 02:09:06,167
Whatever you do,
 the relatives can't be friends.

2795
02:09:07,167 --> 02:09:08,458
What's the need to talk with him?

2796
02:09:08,458 --> 02:09:09,875
Thrash him and throw out.

2797
02:09:38,667 --> 02:09:39,625
Anand!

2798
02:10:03,667 --> 02:10:04,667
What did you say?

2799
02:10:04,917 --> 02:10:06,375
Am I watching?

2800
02:10:06,542 --> 02:10:08,458
I'll be a spectator
when he hits others.

2801
02:10:12,875 --> 02:10:14,708
If you hit him,
I'll not be a spectator.

2802
02:11:56,708 --> 02:12:00,000
Are we sitting here
 not knowing to go?

2803
02:12:12,583 --> 02:12:14,667
That's it.
-They are his kith and kin.

2804
02:12:14,667 --> 02:12:16,167
Today, he had hit them.

2805
02:12:16,167 --> 02:12:18,667
That is friendship!
-I don't understand.

2806
02:12:18,667 --> 02:12:20,167
You will never understand.

2807
02:12:20,167 --> 02:12:23,333
You should've been as a true friend
with someone in your life to understand it.

2808
02:12:24,042 --> 02:12:26,250
Is it sweet?
-No, poison.

2809
02:12:35,333 --> 02:12:37,333
I've seen people humiliated
by the halted marriage.

2810
02:12:37,333 --> 02:12:40,000
Just now saw
who ask for extra gold.

2811
02:12:44,750 --> 02:12:46,667
I'll talk.
Be patient.

2812
02:12:48,292 --> 02:12:49,208
Forgive me, uncle.

2813
02:12:49,208 --> 02:12:50,542
Don't mistake me as I say this.

2814
02:12:50,542 --> 02:12:53,667
Giving thousand sovereigns of gold
and getting her married to a wastrel,

2815
02:12:53,667 --> 02:12:55,125
You no need to do anything
 and if you send Kavya...

2816
02:12:55,125 --> 02:12:57,833
...my friend will take care of
 her like a Queen.

2817
02:12:58,167 --> 02:13:01,958
Though he knows this clan is here,
 he came alone for Kavya.

2818
02:13:01,958 --> 02:13:03,958
He will look after her, well.

2819
02:13:04,417 --> 02:13:07,458
Not only that, even Kavya likes him.

2820
02:13:07,458 --> 02:13:08,667
Co-operate uncle.
-Please, uncle.

2821
02:13:08,667 --> 02:13:10,000
Let them both be together, uncle.
- Co-operate.

2822
02:13:10,458 --> 02:13:13,250
Go and fall on his foot, immediately.
Go and fall.

2823
02:13:13,583 --> 02:13:14,708
Fall on his foot.

2824
02:13:14,708 --> 02:13:19,417
The day when Anand told Ashok
not to love Kavya,

2825
02:13:19,417 --> 02:13:23,958
I know well,
Anand will do their marriage.

2826
02:13:23,958 --> 02:13:26,042
Because, their history is like so!

2827
02:13:26,042 --> 02:13:28,042
Everything got over well.

2828
02:13:28,042 --> 02:13:30,917
Then, why are they roaming
 in the company jeep?

2829
02:13:36,750 --> 02:13:37,917
Hey, be careful.

2830
02:13:38,750 --> 02:13:40,042
Who is that?
Crossing over...

2831
02:13:43,583 --> 02:13:45,792
Have you started?

2832
02:13:46,583 --> 02:13:49,333
Are you sacrificing your life
 for the goodness of Anand.

2833
02:13:49,667 --> 02:13:50,542
Please, come.

2834
02:13:50,542 --> 02:13:51,500
Get down.

2835
02:13:51,500 --> 02:13:52,333
Come.

2836
02:13:54,167 --> 02:13:56,792
It's not sacrifice to abandon
the one who love us.

2837
02:13:56,792 --> 02:13:59,500
Whoever says anything,
 he lives with your thoughts.

2838
02:13:59,500 --> 02:14:00,750
That's sacrifice!

2839
02:14:02,208 --> 02:14:03,792
After your marriage,

2840
02:14:03,792 --> 02:14:05,833
Do you know how many
proposals her mother got him?

2841
02:14:05,833 --> 02:14:07,125
He denied everyone.

2842
02:14:07,125 --> 02:14:08,792
You didn't esteem that.

2843
02:14:08,792 --> 02:14:11,125
But, his mother's words
are more important to you, isn't it?

2844
02:14:11,125 --> 02:14:12,500
Don't talk without understanding, Ashok.

2845
02:14:13,167 --> 02:14:15,042
I took this decision for my sake.

2846
02:14:19,125 --> 02:14:20,833
Please, allow me to go.

2847
02:14:21,125 --> 02:14:22,958
I don't know why are you
making me to suffer?

2848
02:14:22,958 --> 02:14:25,458
Why can't you understand
my pain?

2849
02:14:29,708 --> 02:14:32,000
Look Sofia, I'll ask you one thing.

2850
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:33,917
Do you wish to live
 with Anand or not?

2851
02:14:40,667 --> 02:14:41,750
You are lying, Sofia.

2852
02:14:41,750 --> 02:14:43,875
We can commit many mistakes
 in our life, without aware of it.

2853
02:14:44,125 --> 02:14:45,708
That will not affect us.

2854
02:14:46,125 --> 02:14:47,667
If you do a mistake,
aware of it...

2855
02:14:47,667 --> 02:14:49,667
It'll make you feel guilty
 throughout your life.

2856
02:14:49,667 --> 02:14:51,708
Now, the decision
you're taking to leave Anand...

2857
02:14:51,708 --> 02:14:53,167
...is the mistake
 you're doing for your life.

2858
02:14:53,958 --> 02:14:55,792
Sir, what's your call?

2859
02:14:55,792 --> 02:14:58,208
The decision I took for her
 has gone wrong.

2860
02:14:58,208 --> 02:15:02,667
Now, I agree whatever decision she takes.

2861
02:15:02,667 --> 02:15:04,125
She isn't taking the decision,

2862
02:15:04,750 --> 02:15:06,292
She wants to end everything.

2863
02:15:06,292 --> 02:15:07,333
Hey, be silent.

2864
02:15:07,458 --> 02:15:08,708
Sofia, don't think still.

2865
02:15:08,708 --> 02:15:10,667
Do you wish to live
with Anand or not?

2866
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:12,833
Tell us, Sofia.

2867
02:15:12,833 --> 02:15:14,958
Though you said,
she is thinking still.

2868
02:15:14,958 --> 02:15:15,667
Let her go.

2869
02:15:15,667 --> 02:15:17,500
What's this?
He is talking, right?

2870
02:15:17,500 --> 02:15:18,625
You might spoil
everything it seems.

2871
02:15:18,625 --> 02:15:20,042
Shut your mouth
and keep quiet for sometime.

2872
02:15:20,042 --> 02:15:21,625
What do you want
to say more than this?

2873
02:15:21,792 --> 02:15:23,083
Please, don't hinder her.

2874
02:15:23,542 --> 02:15:24,917
Let her go,
wherever she wants.

2875
02:15:26,125 --> 02:15:28,125
Wherever she goes,
I'll go along with her.

2876
02:15:30,917 --> 02:15:31,667
Oh, gosh!

2877
02:15:31,833 --> 02:15:33,458
I thought you've redeemed.

2878
02:15:34,417 --> 02:15:36,250
Then, what?
She smiled.

2879
02:15:36,250 --> 02:15:38,292
Come here.

2880
02:15:39,042 --> 02:15:41,250
Come, dear.
-He feels shy.

2881
02:15:41,250 --> 02:15:42,708
Come here.

2882
02:15:43,500 --> 02:15:45,792
Sir, bless them.

2883
02:15:46,542 --> 02:15:48,375
Come, let everyone take a selfie.

2884
02:18:12,250 --> 02:18:14,083
