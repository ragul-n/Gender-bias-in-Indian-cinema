00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:00,888
Mr. Malhotra where

What a great woman!

15
00:03:30,957 --> 00:03:32,822
She isn't a member
of this home..

16
00:03:33,627 --> 00:03:35,390
..but this isn't a
home without her.

17
00:03:35,495 --> 00:03:40,432
He came in my sleep
and robbed me.

18
00:03:40,934 --> 00:03:44,597

Will you just serve whiskey

You haven't drunk anything.
Your glass is empty.

37
00:04:39,392 --> 00:04:40,825
Drink to your heart's
content. Ok.

38
00:04:41,261 --> 00:04:43,525
Today no limit. Ok? Ok.

39
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:52,133
ls this how you do your duty?

40
00:04:52,606 --> 00:04:55,666
Your carelessness can give
enemy a chance to enter.

41
00:04:55,742 --> 00:04:56,709
Sorry sir.

42
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:57,970

00:05:05,085 --> 00:05:07,110
Yes sir. Fool!

46
00:05:07,887 --> 00:05:11,482
He robbed me but blamed me.

47
00:05:11,891 --> 00:05:15,520
He put me into such a state.

48
00:05:18,698 --> 00:05:22,225
How can l say everything?

49
00:05:22,569 --> 00:05:26,164
Whatever he did was magical.

50
00:05:26,339 --> 00:05:29,672
l feel shy on looking
at the mirror.

51
00:05:29,943 --> 00:05:33,276
l'm scared of myself.

52
00:05:33,513 --> 00:05:36,812
He pulled my veil.

53
00:05:37,217 --> 00:05:40,448
He took me in his arms.

54
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:43,589

55
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:47,717
He came in my sleep
and robbed me.

56
00:05:48,795 --> 00:05:51,491
lt's very grand! Wow!

57
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,529
Yes yes. Sister is here.

58
00:06:04,377 --> 00:06:05,674
Uncle! Forgive me uncle.

59
00:06:06,579 --> 00:06:07,637
Forgive me.

60
00:06:08,481 --> 00:06:13,680
l've come staking my life
only to apologize to you.

61
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,747
Get up Zoravar. Get up.

62
00:06:19,192 --> 00:06:20,659
l forgot my position uncle.

63
00:06:21,828 --> 00:06:26,197
l forgot that even an old lion
is stronger than a dog.

64
00:06:27,267 --> 00:06:28,199
Now..

65
00:06:30,236 --> 00:06:32,670
Now l'll obey you.

66
00:06:33,239 --> 00:06:35,935
l'll do my business
as per your rules.

67
00:06:36,776 --> 00:06:40,234
Now l'll have neither enmity
nor fight with you.

68
00:06:41,347 --> 00:06:44,714
l came to forge friendship
uncle. Friendship.

69
00:06:45,552 --> 00:06:48,350
When did you consider yourself
worthy of it?

70
00:06:51,191 --> 00:06:55,184
lf not friendship at least
give us blessings.

71
00:06:55,595 --> 00:06:59,463
Uncle l think it's their
ruse. Balraj.

72
00:07:01,801 --> 00:07:03,428
lf the enemy comes
in our house..

73
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:05,235
..he becomes our guest.

74
00:07:05,872 --> 00:07:09,467
lt's our duty to honour
and protect him.

75
00:07:10,577 --> 00:07:15,412
lf he has realized his mistake
we too should..

76
00:07:16,149 --> 00:07:18,549
..clear all past misgivings.

77
00:07:18,785 --> 00:07:21,754
Let's all celebrate together.

78
00:07:22,088 --> 00:07:23,077
Come son.

79
00:07:23,256 --> 00:07:26,521
This incident happened
last night.

80
00:07:26,826 --> 00:07:30,284
Now why are you repenting?

81
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:32,421
lt had to happen some
day. Brother.

82
00:07:33,433 --> 00:07:36,925
l didn't understand
your game plan.

83
00:07:38,171 --> 00:07:40,537
What was the need to apologize
to that old man?

84
00:07:41,641 --> 00:07:45,441
To take a leap players
have to retreat.

85
00:07:46,412 --> 00:07:51,907
Similarly to uproot an enemy
we've to bow down.

86
00:07:52,685 --> 00:07:53,481
Come.

87
00:07:55,155 --> 00:07:58,215

90
00:08:05,532 --> 00:08:08,797
He took me in his arms.

91
00:08:09,169 --> 00:08:12,070
l lost so many things.

92
00:08:12,138 --> 00:08:16,666
He came in my sleep
and robbed me.

00:08:23,483 --> 00:08:26,145

00:08:32,225 --> 00:08:35,126

Uncle! Father.

116
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,759
Uncle! What happened?

117
00:10:49,662 --> 00:10:50,594
Uncle!

118
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:51,722
Call the ambulance.

119
00:11:33,473 --> 00:11:35,907
Mr. Balraj Zoravar is
celebrating now with..

120
00:11:35,942 --> 00:11:37,637
..Raghuvir at Madh
island bungalow.

121
00:12:03,236 --> 00:12:07,900
Friend you're sitting as if
it's someone's funeral.

122
00:12:08,307 --> 00:12:10,366
Zoravar my funeral will
take place soon.

123
00:12:10,676 --> 00:12:12,906
What nonsense! l'm
telling the truth.

124
00:12:13,379 --> 00:12:16,473
Mr. Thakur and my brotherinlaw
are still alive.

125
00:12:16,849 --> 00:12:18,874
He won't spare me for
this betrayal.

126
00:12:20,787 --> 00:12:25,383
Friend when you befriend
the most powerful man..

127
00:12:26,592 --> 00:12:29,891
..you shouldn't fear others.

128
00:12:30,696 --> 00:12:31,822
That old man!

129
00:12:34,167 --> 00:12:36,567
He won't live long.

130
00:12:37,537 --> 00:12:42,941
As for Balraj. He's longing
to reach me.

131
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:47,871
But l'm craving more
to kill him.

132
00:13:06,566 --> 00:13:07,624
Balraj?

133
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,670
You made a big mistake..

134
00:13:17,343 --> 00:13:19,743
..by shedding blood
at the place..

135
00:13:20,847 --> 00:13:26,308
..which was akin to
a temple for me.

136
00:13:27,186 --> 00:13:30,587
Fool before celebrating
your victory..

137
00:13:32,492 --> 00:13:38,431
..you should've thought that
Balraj Dutt is still alive.

138
00:14:06,692 --> 00:14:13,120
l can riddle you with all the
bullets in this pistol.

139
00:14:14,133 --> 00:14:19,628
But l want you to live so that..

140
00:14:19,705 --> 00:14:22,299
..whenever you'll walk
with crutches..

141
00:14:22,942 --> 00:14:26,378
..instead of the sound
of the crutches..

142
00:14:27,246 --> 00:14:30,875
..you'll remember Balraj Dutt.

143
00:14:35,288 --> 00:14:37,483
Brotherinlaw no!
No brotherinlaw!

144
00:14:37,723 --> 00:14:39,213
Brotherinlaw no!

145
00:14:39,358 --> 00:14:41,223

Forgive me Sumitra.

150

l've killed your brother
Raghuvir.

151
00:15:17,463 --> 00:15:23,766
Raghuvir helped those people
who shot uncle.

152
00:15:26,305 --> 00:15:27,704
Don't think..

153
00:15:29,442 --> 00:15:31,808
.. l'm mourning my
brother's death.

154
00:15:32,778 --> 00:15:38,182
l'm sad because you snatched
my rights from me.

00:15:39,619 --> 00:15:44,352

that betrayer. Only me.

156
00:15:45,191 --> 00:15:46,590

As long as l'm alive..

168
00:16:33,472 --> 00:16:35,531
Nobody can harm Nihal.

169
00:16:36,909 --> 00:16:40,675
For me everything will be
come after this boy.

170
00:16:41,847 --> 00:16:45,476

Get up brother. Get up.

00:33:09,501 --> 00:33:10,832
..you too didn't forget me.

372
00:33:10,902 --> 00:33:13,871
Balraj doesn't forget his foe..

373
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:17,574
..until he doesn't kill him.

374
00:33:22,213 --> 00:33:25,512
l'll do kill you Balraj.

375
00:33:26,284 --> 00:33:28,218
Because l'm released now.

376
00:33:28,386 --> 00:33:31,583
Don't think that Zoravar
is released.

377
00:33:31,756 --> 00:33:34,122
Consider your death has arrived.

378
00:33:35,126 --> 00:33:36,855
l'll strike in such a way that..

379
00:33:36,961 --> 00:33:41,489

380
00:33:50,875 --> 00:33:51,739
Uncle!

381
00:33:53,478 --> 00:33:54,740
What is it uncle?

383
00:33:57,782 --> 00:33:59,943
You're the cause of
my worries Nihal.

384
00:34:00,318 --> 00:34:01,808
What do you mean uncle?

385
00:34:03,555 --> 00:34:06,524
Do you think l'm not
aware of your deeds?

386
00:34:08,193 --> 00:34:10,354
You haven't been to
office for months.

387
00:34:11,463 --> 00:34:15,399
Neither do you visit factories
or construction sites.

388
00:34:16,434 --> 00:34:18,299
You've such a big business..

389
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:20,865
..but you don't care for it.

390
00:34:21,406 --> 00:34:23,340
Uncle you're here to take
care of these things.

391
00:34:23,475 --> 00:34:24,464
No son.

392
00:34:25,610 --> 00:34:27,100
l'm just the trustee.

393
00:34:27,479 --> 00:34:28,571
You're the owner.

394
00:34:29,681 --> 00:34:33,481
And now l want to make you aware
of this responsibility.

395
00:34:34,452 --> 00:34:36,443
You'll go to Cochin
this evening.

396
00:34:37,155 --> 00:34:38,315
Cochin? Yes son.

397
00:34:38,723 --> 00:34:40,588
We're constructing a five
star hotel there.

398
00:34:40,658 --> 00:34:42,751
You'll stay there till
its completion.

399
00:34:43,128 --> 00:34:45,460
Please uncle. Don't involve
me in this hassle.

What happened?

403
00:34:53,438 --> 00:34:54,803
How did you get these wounds?

404
00:34:55,874 --> 00:34:58,399
l went to hunt with friends.

405
00:34:59,310 --> 00:35:01,744
This isn't a work of
any small animal.

406
00:35:02,914 --> 00:35:05,178
lt seems a lion pawed you.

407
00:35:05,650 --> 00:35:06,378
Yes.

408
00:35:06,551 --> 00:35:07,916
Nice? Old man. Buy it?

00:35:11,689 --> 00:35:13,520
What nonsense! Let
it be child.

412
00:35:13,625 --> 00:35:15,490
lt's these goons daily routine.

413
00:35:17,128 --> 00:35:18,288
What did you say?

414
00:35:18,396 --> 00:35:20,489
Talk politely or else
l'll slap you.

415
00:35:21,299 --> 00:35:23,733
You want to try it
here or at home.

416
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:27,365
l'll change my dress at home.

417
00:35:27,472 --> 00:35:30,737
But l think your sister changed

418
00:35:30,809 --> 00:35:31,571

00:35:31,776 --> 00:35:34,802

lf not for you today..

437
00:38:36,728 --> 00:38:40,289
Your sister would be fortunate
to have a brother like you.

438
00:38:40,765 --> 00:38:42,596
'Forgive me brother.'

439
00:38:44,202 --> 00:38:45,100

Because of me your window
pane was shattered.

A girl's honor is dearer
that this window pane.

00:39:10,862 --> 00:39:11,886
What do you do?

446
00:39:13,297 --> 00:39:14,161

00:39:35,486 --> 00:39:36,885
lt's not good to fall in love.

452
00:39:37,121 --> 00:39:38,520

454
00:39:40,224 --> 00:39:41,623

00:39:41,693 --> 00:39:43,251
lt's not good to fall in love.

456
00:39:43,327 --> 00:39:44,760
Love makes you crazy.

ln love you will
lose everything.

Brother. Yes?

471
00:40:36,814 --> 00:40:40,181
Which bus goes to Sion
Koliwada? 356.

472
00:40:40,251 --> 00:40:42,981
Why not 355? Because 355

00:40:43,287 --> 00:40:45,551
l asked where does bus 355 go?

474
00:40:45,723 --> 00:40:47,918
Anywhere but not Sion Koliwada.

475
00:40:48,292 --> 00:40:50,988
lt doesn't go to Sion Koliwada.
Ok. l don't care.

476

Do all people in this
city travel in bus?

No they travel by car too.

479

ln car too? Then why
don't you go?

480
00:40:58,336 --> 00:40:59,803
Why are you standing here?

481

Or l don't like to

Then listen.

500
00:41:51,289 --> 00:41:53,223
Tell your dad to buy
you an airplane.

501
00:41:53,758 --> 00:41:55,623
Because while driving a
car you have to use..

502
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,591
..the brakes and polite words.

503
00:41:58,296 --> 00:41:59,786
Do you know whom you're
talking to?

504
00:41:59,931 --> 00:42:03,799
A stubborn snobbish
and silly girl.

505
00:42:04,368 --> 00:42:05,198

Sorry sir. Because of me

After ages l saw a man using his
obsession in the right way.

515
00:42:44,408 --> 00:42:45,432
l liked it.

516
00:42:45,877 --> 00:42:47,435

517
00:42:48,579 --> 00:42:51,309
Where do you stay son? Who

518
00:42:53,184 --> 00:42:55,709

for a destination.

519
00:42:55,887 --> 00:42:58,321
Consider you've reached
your destination.

520
00:43:00,358 --> 00:43:01,222
Come.

00:43:01,893 --> 00:43:04,157

a great personality.

522
00:43:04,495 --> 00:43:05,291
Come.

523
00:43:12,703 --> 00:43:14,227
He's Mr. Thakur.

524
00:43:15,373 --> 00:43:16,533
My teacher.

525
00:43:17,575 --> 00:43:19,702
Today Balraj Dutt is
in this position..

526
00:43:20,778 --> 00:43:22,268
..because of him.

527
00:43:24,615 --> 00:43:25,775
When l was small..

528
00:43:27,351 --> 00:43:29,615
..a strange incident
took place with me.

529
00:43:30,755 --> 00:43:33,918
lt wasn't an incident
but an accident.

530
00:43:36,127 --> 00:43:36,855
l saw..

531
00:43:44,635 --> 00:43:46,500
Don't cry son. Don't cry.

532
00:43:46,637 --> 00:43:48,502
Now you've to take
care of the house.

533
00:43:48,606 --> 00:43:50,506
Come. l've lost him.

534
00:43:57,281 --> 00:43:58,646
Nab him! He ran away!

535
00:43:58,783 --> 00:43:59,875
Nab him!

536
00:44:00,151 --> 00:44:01,311
Thief! Nab him!

537
00:44:02,386 --> 00:44:04,183
Fool! You steal a shroud.

538
00:44:06,657 --> 00:44:08,147
Move. Wait.

539
00:44:08,225 --> 00:44:10,159
Don't hit him. No.
Don't hit him.

540
00:44:10,494 --> 00:44:12,394
Hit me sir. Hit me.

..needs this cloth more?

543

Son who is she? What's your
relationship with her?

544
00:44:21,672 --> 00:44:24,732
Nothing. l don't even know her.

545
00:44:24,909 --> 00:44:27,935
l just saw her plight and
couldn't stop myself.

546
00:44:28,212 --> 00:44:29,577
So l did this sin.

547
00:44:30,581 --> 00:44:34,312
Son you've not done a
sin but a great deed.

548
00:44:34,719 --> 00:44:36,380
What's your name?

549
00:44:40,958 --> 00:44:44,189
Now you'll be known as Balraj.

550
00:44:44,829 --> 00:44:45,591
Listen.

551
00:44:52,870 --> 00:44:55,338
Today every drop of my blood..

552
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:58,208
..is indebted to Mr. Thakur.

553
00:45:01,078 --> 00:45:02,443
Yesterday..

554
00:45:03,147 --> 00:45:08,744
..when l saw you staking your
life for some girl..

555
00:45:10,721 --> 00:45:14,714
..l saw my reflection in you.

556
00:45:15,126 --> 00:45:19,563
Son l want you to stay
in this house with me.

557
00:45:20,398 --> 00:45:22,832
You won't feel loneliness here.

558
00:45:27,171 --> 00:45:28,195
Ok.

559
00:45:31,675 --> 00:45:32,607
Yes sir.

560
00:45:32,843 --> 00:45:35,676
You must be wondering
that l'm a servant..

561
00:45:35,913 --> 00:45:37,608
..but in pilot's uniform.

562
00:45:37,815 --> 00:45:41,307
By the way since childhood
l wanted to be a pilot.

563
00:45:41,552 --> 00:45:43,315
l couldn't fulfill that dream.

564
00:45:43,521 --> 00:45:47,184
So l wear this uniform
and roam around.

565
00:45:47,591 --> 00:45:50,583
By the way are you sir's
relative? No.

566
00:45:51,195 --> 00:45:54,289
Are you his old acquaintance?
No.

567
00:45:54,398 --> 00:45:56,889
Ok. So what do you do? Nothing.

568
00:45:57,201 --> 00:45:58,725
Nothing? Then what
will you do here?

569
00:45:58,869 --> 00:45:59,927
l don't know.

570
00:46:00,271 --> 00:46:01,795
Don't know? Come. Come.

571
00:46:02,073 --> 00:46:03,438
Look at this. Come.

572
00:46:03,641 --> 00:46:06,109
Sir has built this for
special guests.

573
00:46:06,210 --> 00:46:07,234
lt's a guest room.

574
00:46:07,411 --> 00:46:09,606
The marble in the room
are from ltaly.

575
00:46:10,247 --> 00:46:12,807
The tiles in the bathroom
are from Singapore.

576
00:46:13,250 --> 00:46:16,549
And these glasses
are from Belgium.

577
00:46:16,787 --> 00:46:19,620
And these carpets
are from Arabia.

578
00:46:19,757 --> 00:46:23,158
Yes. These are for
special guests.

579
00:46:28,566 --> 00:46:32,798
Sir if you need anything
just ring once.

580
00:46:33,571 --> 00:46:34,663
Good day.

581
00:46:42,379 --> 00:46:43,710
For whom is this fourth plate?

582
00:46:43,814 --> 00:46:44,940
Who is coming papa?

583
00:46:45,249 --> 00:46:46,307

00:46:46,383 --> 00:46:48,214
Go and call Raj. Yes sir.

585

Who is Raj?

586
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:52,689
Another point most parents make
is that kids used to..

587
00:46:52,756 --> 00:46:55,623
..spend lot of time with family
and friends than they do now.

588
00:46:55,726 --> 00:46:57,489
Sir. Sir has called
you for dinner.

589
00:46:58,229 --> 00:47:02,256
Listen. Tell sir l will eat food
after exercise not now.

00:47:02,733 --> 00:47:04,291
You better bring the meal here.

591
00:47:04,368 --> 00:47:06,700
You eat food differently.

592
00:47:08,739 --> 00:47:09,501
No.

593
00:47:09,673 --> 00:47:11,698
l eat using the mouth like you.

594
00:47:12,076 --> 00:47:13,134
Mouth?

00:47:13,277 --> 00:47:15,871
Go and get the food.
Ok sir. Go.

596
00:47:16,714 --> 00:47:18,181
Stupid fool!

00:47:23,287 --> 00:47:24,413
One..

598
00:47:24,522 --> 00:47:27,218
Before leaving.. Sir he
wants to eat in his room.

599
00:47:28,893 --> 00:47:30,326
Who is he dad?

600
00:47:31,228 --> 00:47:31,922

Ok. Send Raj's meal in

00:47:43,641 --> 00:47:46,769
39.. 40.. 41 ..

603
00:47:47,111 --> 00:47:49,341
The loafer from bus

604
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:53,780
43.. 44.. 45..

605
00:47:54,919 --> 00:47:56,887
46.. 47..

606
00:47:57,188 --> 00:47:59,520
48.. 49..

607
00:48:00,424 --> 00:48:02,051
Keep the food on the table.

608
00:48:02,393 --> 00:48:04,190
And get 2 bottles of water.

609
00:48:04,562 --> 00:48:07,053
And listen. When will you
bring the morning tea?

610
00:48:07,198 --> 00:48:09,098
Whenever you order sir.

611
00:48:19,176 --> 00:48:21,167
You are the same..

612
00:48:21,912 --> 00:48:23,675
That stubborn snobbish girl.

613
00:48:24,682 --> 00:48:27,207
What are you doing here?
l'm in my house.

614
00:48:27,351 --> 00:48:28,818
But what are you doing here?

615
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:31,312
Ask your dad.

616
00:48:31,889 --> 00:48:34,858
And listen. Get the morning
tea early. Ok?

617
00:48:35,125 --> 00:48:36,217
Thank you.

618
00:48:37,595 --> 00:48:39,495
Dad likes to keep
animals as pet.

619
00:48:39,763 --> 00:48:41,424
l'll tell him to start a zoo.

620
00:48:42,466 --> 00:48:45,128
54.. 55..

621
00:48:45,236 --> 00:48:47,397
Dark goggles on fair face.

622
00:48:49,673 --> 00:48:52,699
Dark goggles on fair face.

623
00:48:53,844 --> 00:48:55,243
What a trouble!

624
00:48:55,312 --> 00:49:00,340
God have mercy! What
a miracle it is!

625
00:49:00,651 --> 00:49:02,812
What a miracle it is!

626
00:49:03,087 --> 00:49:05,521
Dark goggles on fair face.

627
00:49:08,225 --> 00:49:11,058
Dark goggles on fair face.

628
00:49:13,397 --> 00:49:15,490
God have mercy! Brother.

629
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:17,824
Pilot. What a miracle it is!

630
00:49:18,135 --> 00:49:19,295
l'm talking to you.

631
00:49:19,403 --> 00:49:21,200
What a miracle it
is! Tell me.

632
00:49:21,639 --> 00:49:23,300
Listen. This place
is new for me.

633
00:49:23,374 --> 00:49:24,568
l couldn't sleep at night.

634
00:49:24,642 --> 00:49:26,872
Please turn this music off.

635
00:49:27,278 --> 00:49:28,802
Dark goggles on fair
face. Brother.

636
00:49:29,113 --> 00:49:30,603
Music makes not just humans..

637
00:49:30,714 --> 00:49:33,182
..but even animals
and plants lively.

638
00:49:33,317 --> 00:49:34,750
And you want me to turn it off.

639
00:49:34,852 --> 00:49:37,548
Please try to understand
me. Turn it off.

640
00:49:37,588 --> 00:49:40,182
You're strange. l've to
water these plants.

641
00:49:40,291 --> 00:49:41,883
They're like my kids.
They'll die.

642
00:49:42,159 --> 00:49:44,389
Then water them. Why are
you playing the music?

643
00:49:44,595 --> 00:49:46,688
Please stop it. l
don't like music.

644
00:49:47,298 --> 00:49:48,697
You're strange. Yes l am.

645
00:49:48,766 --> 00:49:50,256
What a stupid fellow!

646
00:49:50,301 --> 00:49:52,792
He can't sleep at night. He
wants no music in the morning.

647
00:49:52,870 --> 00:49:55,100
Tomorrow he'll order me
to uproot the plants..

648
00:49:55,239 --> 00:49:56,604
..and give milk to the weeds.

649
00:49:56,707 --> 00:49:58,368
He'll say he doesn't
like my face.

650
00:49:58,542 --> 00:50:01,375
He's the first man in this
world who hates music.

651
00:50:01,445 --> 00:50:03,709
What happened pilot?
Why are you grumpy?

652
00:50:03,847 --> 00:50:06,315
What to say madam? l
was enjoying my music.

653
00:50:06,417 --> 00:50:09,250
He came and told me to turn
it off. 'l hate music.'

654
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:11,786
lf he hates music l love music.

655
00:50:12,623 --> 00:50:13,817
Out of tune!

656
00:50:18,262 --> 00:50:21,356
Oh! So he hates music.

657
00:52:07,938 --> 00:52:09,303
Bloody fool!

658
00:52:12,209 --> 00:52:13,267

00:52:31,228 --> 00:52:33,253
Open your eyes. You're safe.

665
00:52:35,833 --> 00:52:36,857
You!

666
00:52:37,134 --> 00:52:38,726
No need to thank me.

667
00:52:38,869 --> 00:52:39,961
Thanks! My foot!

668
00:52:40,337 --> 00:52:41,861
How dare you touch me!

669
00:52:42,272 --> 00:52:43,364
You're mistaken.

670
00:52:43,740 --> 00:52:46,504
l didn't touch you. l've held
you or else you would..

671
00:52:46,577 --> 00:52:49,808
Leave me. Are you sure?
l said leave me.

672
00:52:49,913 --> 00:52:51,141
As you wish.

673
00:52:52,950 --> 00:52:54,611
You idiot!

674
00:52:59,890 --> 00:53:00,857
Dad!

675
00:53:01,124 --> 00:53:03,422
l won't let that rogue stay in
this house even for a minute.

676
00:53:03,527 --> 00:53:06,496
He was already insolent.
Today he stooped low.

677
00:53:06,597 --> 00:53:09,191
He took me in his
arms dad. And..

678
00:53:09,266 --> 00:53:12,133
Dad just throw him out.
Throw him out right now.

679
00:53:12,636 --> 00:53:13,364
What?

680
00:53:13,737 --> 00:53:16,171
lf you don't believe

681
00:53:16,273 --> 00:53:18,173
Pilot! Yes madam.

682
00:53:18,308 --> 00:53:19,400
Tell dad the truth.

683
00:53:19,476 --> 00:53:20,773
Didn't l say the truth?

684
00:53:23,514 --> 00:53:25,209
Dear what's the matter?

685
00:53:25,315 --> 00:53:28,682
She fell from the stairs. He

686
00:53:28,919 --> 00:53:30,580
Pilot you bloody idiot.

687

Dad. Come here.

688
00:53:36,460 --> 00:53:38,485
My dear dear Komal.

689
00:53:39,263 --> 00:53:43,791
Find some other way to drive
that decent boy out.

690
00:53:52,276 --> 00:53:54,301
Hello. Balraj Dutt.

691
00:53:55,178 --> 00:53:56,941
Zoravar speaking.

692
00:53:57,781 --> 00:54:00,614
Dogs don't speak but bark.

693
00:54:02,819 --> 00:54:05,811
Now that you've called me
a dog listen to me.

694
00:54:06,857 --> 00:54:09,519
l've sniffed out your kin Dutt.

695
00:54:10,694 --> 00:54:12,161
You didn't understand.

696
00:54:13,630 --> 00:54:16,360
Your blood. Your daughter.

697
00:54:17,834 --> 00:54:19,131
Yes.

698
00:54:19,403 --> 00:54:22,201
She's young and beautiful too.

699
00:54:37,688 --> 00:54:38,848
Raj.

700
00:54:40,424 --> 00:54:41,891
Raj! Yes?

701
00:54:45,629 --> 00:54:46,653
Komal..

702
00:54:47,431 --> 00:54:49,797
..has left for college for
her show rehearsal.

703
00:54:50,567 --> 00:54:51,864
Take care of her.

704
00:54:52,302 --> 00:54:53,291
Fine.

705
00:54:56,173 --> 00:54:59,404
You're right for me.

706
00:54:59,910 --> 00:55:03,141
You're the best in lndia.

707
00:55:13,323 --> 00:55:14,517
Stop the music.

708
00:55:15,192 --> 00:55:16,523
What's this pal?

709
00:55:17,194 --> 00:55:18,889
We're doing the same
step for 3 hours.

710
00:55:19,196 --> 00:55:20,595
Can't you do a simple step?

711
00:55:20,664 --> 00:55:23,258
Listen. l can't do these
whacky steps.

712
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:25,661
l'll do the steps which
are comfortable for me.

713
00:55:25,769 --> 00:55:27,293
You follow my steps.

714
00:55:27,404 --> 00:55:29,599
Listen madam. Don't
try to teach me.

715
00:55:30,107 --> 00:55:31,574
You too don't teach me.

716
00:55:31,875 --> 00:55:33,740
Do you know whom you're
talking to?

717
00:55:34,211 --> 00:55:36,202
Your college begged
me to come here.

718
00:55:37,247 --> 00:55:39,613
l'm Rocky. Rocky the pop star.

719
00:55:39,750 --> 00:55:40,910
Maybe in your house.

720
00:55:41,218 --> 00:55:43,448
Any monkey can fling
his limbs like that.

721
00:55:43,754 --> 00:55:46,518
Fine. Get a monkey
for your show.

722
00:55:46,657 --> 00:55:48,215
l'm leaving. Goodbye.

723
00:55:48,425 --> 00:55:50,586
Go. Go! Nobody is stopping you.

724
00:55:50,794 --> 00:55:52,625
Komal what have you done?

725
00:55:52,863 --> 00:55:55,627
We convinced Rocky with such
difficulty for this show.

726
00:55:55,699 --> 00:55:57,189
What about tomorrow's show now?

727
00:55:57,300 --> 00:55:59,530
This monkey is here
to dance. Him?

728
00:56:00,303 --> 00:56:02,567
Komal this is about
the college's show.

729
00:56:02,673 --> 00:56:05,642
Listen. Get that handsome ready.

730
00:56:06,143 --> 00:56:07,303
Him?

731
00:56:07,544 --> 00:56:08,636
Never.

732
00:56:08,745 --> 00:56:11,270
Komal in need we've to
beg even the menials.

733
00:56:11,415 --> 00:56:12,439
l said no.

734
00:56:12,549 --> 00:56:15,484
Ok. Be prepared tomorrow to
get booed by audience.

735
00:56:15,619 --> 00:56:16,745
Yes.

736
00:56:18,221 --> 00:56:22,783
lf you insist l'll try to
make this monkey dance.

737
00:56:24,728 --> 00:56:26,457
Good afternoon dad.
Good afternoon mom.

738
00:56:26,530 --> 00:56:28,657
Good afternoon. Let
me help you. Ok.

739
00:56:28,865 --> 00:56:31,197
Dad we've a college function.

740
00:56:31,468 --> 00:56:34,437
Do you want donation? No.

741
00:56:35,539 --> 00:56:36,665
Order me.

742
00:56:36,773 --> 00:56:38,468
We prepared a dance item.

743
00:56:38,608 --> 00:56:40,200
But my dancing partner fled.

744
00:56:40,644 --> 00:56:43,545
So you want your dad to
dance in his place?

745
00:56:43,714 --> 00:56:45,875
No mom. Even a monkey
can do it.

746
00:56:46,349 --> 00:56:47,816
Have you found a monkey?

747
00:56:47,884 --> 00:56:49,943
He's in our house. Your Raj.

748
00:56:50,687 --> 00:56:53,622
Even if he flings his limbs on
stage my work will be done.

749
00:56:54,157 --> 00:56:57,217
l've once seen his style
of using his limbs.

750
00:56:57,861 --> 00:57:01,456
But l've to ask him how he
uses his limbs with music.

751
00:57:01,598 --> 00:57:03,395
No dad. l don't have much time.

752
00:57:03,567 --> 00:57:05,262
You've to convince him.

753
00:57:05,335 --> 00:57:06,666
My prestige is at stake.

754
00:57:06,737 --> 00:57:08,762
Please dad. Ok. Ok.

755
00:57:09,306 --> 00:57:10,398
Thank you.

756
00:57:58,722 --> 00:58:01,850
You're right for me.

757
00:58:02,459 --> 00:58:05,690
Come on. Come on guys.

00:58:23,213 --> 00:58:27,274
Yes. You're right for me.

763
00:58:27,384 --> 00:58:28,646
What? l couldn't hear it.

764
00:58:28,718 --> 00:58:30,185
Say it louder. Louder.

765
00:58:30,253 --> 00:58:33,882
Yes. You're right for me.

766
00:58:34,524 --> 00:58:37,493
You're the best in lndia.

767
00:58:38,295 --> 00:58:41,230
You're right for me.

00:58:41,598 --> 00:58:44,658
You're the best in lndia.

770
00:59:24,341 --> 00:59:27,105
Give me a flying kiss.

771
00:59:28,345 --> 00:59:34,147
You'll be out if you
miss the flying kiss.

772
00:59:34,251 --> 00:59:36,617
Baby kiss. Kiss. Kiss.

773
00:59:37,754 --> 00:59:40,120

00:59:48,899 --> 00:59:52,300
You're right for me.

778
00:59:52,702 --> 00:59:55,796
You're the best in lndia.

779
01:00:38,615 --> 01:00:41,607
Tell me honestly.

780
01:00:42,585 --> 01:00:45,554
How do you like my touch?

781
01:00:46,256 --> 01:00:49,453
l've seen your touch.

782
01:00:49,659 --> 01:00:52,651
Now save yourself
from my touch.

783
01:00:52,762 --> 01:00:54,354
Save yourself. Save yourself.

784
01:00:54,431 --> 01:00:56,365
Save yourself. Save yourself.

785
01:00:56,433 --> 01:00:58,731
Save yourself. Save yourself.

786
01:01:00,170 --> 01:01:03,298
You're right for me.

787
01:01:03,740 --> 01:01:06,709
You're the best in lndia.

788
01:01:07,310 --> 01:01:10,370
You're right for me.

789
01:01:10,847 --> 01:01:14,715
You're the best in lndia.

790
01:01:21,358 --> 01:01:24,589
You're right for me.

791
01:01:25,228 --> 01:01:28,391
You're the best in lndia.

792
01:01:28,531 --> 01:01:32,126
You're right for me.

793
01:01:32,669 --> 01:01:35,433
You're the best in lndia.

794
01:01:35,538 --> 01:01:39,372
You're right for me.

795
01:01:39,776 --> 01:01:42,643
You're the best in lndia.

796
01:01:44,647 --> 01:01:46,706
How do you like this monkey?
Hell with you.

797
01:01:47,317 --> 01:01:48,545
What happened to Komal?

798
01:01:50,220 --> 01:01:51,482
Thank you. Thank you.

799
01:01:54,290 --> 01:01:56,451
Whether someone believes
it or not Sumitra..

800
01:01:56,760 --> 01:01:59,957
..l can proclaim proudly that
l've found a diamond..

801
01:02:00,163 --> 01:02:01,357
..from a coal mine.

802
01:02:02,465 --> 01:02:04,160
l can't praise Raj enough.

803
01:02:04,601 --> 01:02:07,502
Be it a fighting arena
or dancing stage..

804
01:02:07,570 --> 01:02:09,162
..he defeats everyone. Enough.

805
01:02:09,305 --> 01:02:10,567
He's best in everything.

806
01:02:10,673 --> 01:02:13,141
Enough. He's a one man
show. One man show.

807
01:02:13,209 --> 01:02:14,369
You're right.

808
01:02:14,477 --> 01:02:16,638
He came here just
a few days ago..

809
01:02:16,846 --> 01:02:19,838
..but it seems he was
always with us.

810
01:02:21,351 --> 01:02:23,876
lf l could l would never
let him leave.

811
01:02:24,187 --> 01:02:25,620
Am l right Komal?

812
01:02:27,490 --> 01:02:28,457
What happened?

813
01:02:46,609 --> 01:02:48,372
What a girl pal!

814
01:02:51,881 --> 01:02:53,644
This was my left hand slap.

815
01:02:54,217 --> 01:02:56,981
You might not be able to endure
my right hand slap.

816
01:02:57,654 --> 01:02:59,315
Let it be. You don't know her.

817
01:02:59,389 --> 01:03:00,481
She's Balraj Dutt's daughter.

818
01:03:00,590 --> 01:03:03,821
Don't mess with her or you'll
be in trouble. Have it.

819
01:03:07,630 --> 01:03:09,393
Hi Komal. Hi Komal.

820
01:03:10,567 --> 01:03:11,693
What happened to her?

821
01:03:11,734 --> 01:03:14,567
What's the matter? Why
you are upset pal?

822
01:03:14,871 --> 01:03:16,532
Tell me what will
you have? Blood.

823
01:03:16,706 --> 01:03:18,833
Whose? His name is Raj.

824
01:03:19,209 --> 01:03:21,234
Dad has forced him in my life.

825
01:03:21,644 --> 01:03:24,408
l would change my life if l
don't make his life miserable.

826
01:03:24,514 --> 01:03:25,845
lt's very easy.

827
01:03:26,182 --> 01:03:27,308
Yes.

828
01:03:27,617 --> 01:03:28,743
Yes dear. Ok. Ok.

829
01:03:28,818 --> 01:03:29,944
Fine.

830
01:03:30,787 --> 01:03:31,845
Here.

831
01:03:32,455 --> 01:03:35,390
Raj l've given instructions
about this.

832
01:03:35,592 --> 01:03:37,890
Now it's your duty
to follow it. Ok.

833
01:03:38,561 --> 01:03:39,653
Wow!

834
01:03:39,863 --> 01:03:42,696
You've come in a big crowd.
What's the matter?

835
01:03:42,966 --> 01:03:46,299
Uncle we're scared to ask.
Will you refuse us?

836
01:03:46,603 --> 01:03:49,595
First tell me. l'll
decide that later.

837
01:03:49,739 --> 01:03:51,764
First promise that
you won't refuse.

838
01:03:51,941 --> 01:03:54,409
You're asking me to promise
without telling me.

839
01:03:54,511 --> 01:03:56,308
First tell me what's
the matter?

840
01:03:58,148 --> 01:04:00,207
Uncle we want to go on
a picnic tomorrow.

841
01:04:00,283 --> 01:04:02,183
And we want to take Komal along.

842
01:04:02,619 --> 01:04:04,519
So what's the problem dear?

843
01:04:05,288 --> 01:04:06,619
Go. Thanks uncle.

844
01:04:06,656 --> 01:04:08,647
Raj go with them.

845
01:04:09,425 --> 01:04:11,689
No dad. We want to go alone.

846
01:04:12,295 --> 01:04:14,559
Raj won't come with
us. lmpossible.

847
01:04:14,898 --> 01:04:18,334
So many girls can't go without
a responsible man.

848
01:04:18,568 --> 01:04:19,660
lmpossible

849
01:04:19,869 --> 01:04:22,599
Raj will go with you. But dad..

850
01:04:22,705 --> 01:04:23,763
No.

851
01:04:24,174 --> 01:04:26,472
No discussions. No arguments.

852
01:04:26,576 --> 01:04:28,737
Raj will go with you. Ok?

853
01:04:29,379 --> 01:04:30,471
Take this.

854
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:39,855
Wow! lt's lovely pal. Lovely.

855
01:04:39,923 --> 01:04:41,857
Let's click snaps. Yes.

856
01:04:41,925 --> 01:04:43,586
Listen. Come here. Come here.

857
01:04:43,726 --> 01:04:44,920
What is it?

858
01:04:45,495 --> 01:04:47,588
l'll enter deep water..

859
01:04:48,264 --> 01:04:49,561
..and pretend to drown.

860
01:04:49,666 --> 01:04:51,600
Are you mad? Just listen.

861
01:04:51,701 --> 01:04:54,864
When l scream this idiot will
come to save me. Yes.

862
01:04:54,971 --> 01:04:57,838
When he lifts me click
some snaps. Ok.

863
01:04:58,141 --> 01:05:01,167
l'll show dad that he was
trying to molest me. Ok.

864
01:05:01,344 --> 01:05:02,606
Then he'll be fired.

865
01:05:02,779 --> 01:05:04,872
Ok? Yes. Go. Make
the preparation.

866
01:05:05,281 --> 01:05:06,509
He's so handsome.

867
01:05:06,649 --> 01:05:08,116
lf l were Komal l would've..

868
01:05:08,151 --> 01:05:09,641
..hugged and kissed him.

869
01:05:18,828 --> 01:05:19,852
Sit.

870
01:05:23,633 --> 01:05:25,828
Get the camera ready.
lt'll be fun now.

871
01:06:31,234 --> 01:06:32,462
Come on!

872
01:06:37,140 --> 01:06:38,232
Shoot them!

873
01:06:43,479 --> 01:06:45,413
Hello. Balraj it's junior.

874
01:06:46,749 --> 01:06:48,842
Zoravar's younger brother.
Bakhtavar.

875
01:06:49,585 --> 01:06:52,679
You said if anyone dared to
look at your daughter..

876
01:06:53,556 --> 01:06:55,217
..you'll blind him.

877
01:06:56,192 --> 01:06:59,355
l think it's time to fulfil
your challenge.

878
01:07:00,596 --> 01:07:03,394
Because right now l am as
close to your daughter..

879
01:07:03,733 --> 01:07:06,258
..as the receiver from your ear.

880
01:07:06,436 --> 01:07:09,735
Bakhtavar if my daughter
is harmed..

881
01:07:09,806 --> 01:07:11,171
Don't shout Balraj!

882
01:07:12,108 --> 01:07:16,340
Use you strength to reach your
daughter not in shouting.

883
01:07:17,146 --> 01:07:19,808
Or else you might reach
here with her shroud..

884
01:07:19,916 --> 01:07:21,816
..but you'll fail to find
even her pieces.

885
01:07:22,852 --> 01:07:25,116
Because the explosions
that you can hear..

886
01:07:26,089 --> 01:07:29,490
..aren't festive crackers
but real bullets.

887
01:07:29,759 --> 01:07:32,227
And one bullet is meant
for your daughter.

888
01:07:32,795 --> 01:07:34,319
Only your daughter.

889
01:07:36,899 --> 01:07:39,333
What happened to my daughter?
ls she all right?

890
01:07:39,435 --> 01:07:42,768
Your animosity shouldn't
sacrifice my daughter.

891
01:07:43,306 --> 01:07:45,934
Sumitra Raj is with her.

892
01:07:46,275 --> 01:07:47,435
Komal will be safe.

893
01:07:47,944 --> 01:07:49,912
Komal come in front.
Come in front.

894
01:07:50,713 --> 01:07:52,180
Hurry up. Careful.

895
01:08:09,298 --> 01:08:10,595
What happened? Nothing.

896
01:08:49,505 --> 01:08:51,666
Raj you've been shot.

897
01:08:52,341 --> 01:08:53,330
Come. Go!

898
01:11:06,409 --> 01:11:08,172
We've to wait here
till nightfall.

899
01:11:08,578 --> 01:11:09,738
Sit down.

900
01:11:47,516 --> 01:11:49,245
You've lost lots of blood.

901
01:11:52,955 --> 01:11:54,149
Really?

902
01:12:13,409 --> 01:12:14,808
Relax for a while.

903
01:12:56,686 --> 01:13:01,146
The mistake l did by mistake..

904
01:13:01,223 --> 01:13:05,683
..will never be forgotten
in this life.

905
01:13:06,262 --> 01:13:10,562
We've lost our senses
in vigour.

906
01:13:10,900 --> 01:13:14,859
Now we'll be faithful
to this new bond.

907
01:13:15,304 --> 01:13:19,900
Yes. The mistake l
did by mistake..

01:13:20,643 --> 01:13:25,137
..will never be forgotten

909
01:13:25,314 --> 01:13:29,751
We've lost our senses
in vigour.

910
01:13:29,952 --> 01:13:34,651
Now we'll be faithful
to this new bond.

911

l feel shy to tell you
what gift l got today.

915
01:14:45,227 --> 01:14:46,694
No no no.

916
01:14:46,796 --> 01:14:51,165
The mistake l did by mistake..

917
01:14:51,467 --> 01:14:56,268

Take this.

923
01:15:26,836 --> 01:15:28,133
What are you doing?

924
01:16:04,340 --> 01:16:08,709
l'll come as your bride.

925
01:16:09,211 --> 01:16:13,409
That day isn't too far.

926
01:16:14,383 --> 01:16:23,223
l won't let anyone
else marry you.

927
01:16:25,828 --> 01:16:27,318
No no no.

928
01:16:27,429 --> 01:16:32,696

01:17:01,330 --> 01:17:05,426
Now we'll be faithful

936
01:17:05,868 --> 01:17:10,305
The mistake l did by mistake..

937
01:17:10,539 --> 01:17:15,306
..will never be forgotten
in this life.

938
01:17:58,320 --> 01:17:59,582
What happened? Got scared?

939
01:18:01,323 --> 01:18:03,314
Everything is fine
now. Let's go.

940
01:18:15,337 --> 01:18:17,305
Mom! Komal.

941
01:18:17,673 --> 01:18:20,369
Komal! Mom. My dear!

942
01:18:21,510 --> 01:18:22,534
Oh my God!

943
01:18:22,644 --> 01:18:25,670
Raj you're bleeding
profusely. This..

944
01:18:26,448 --> 01:18:28,348
Call the doctor immediately.

945
01:18:28,417 --> 01:18:30,851
Get hot water and towel.
Ok. Don't worry.

946
01:18:31,086 --> 01:18:32,280
lt's a minor wound..

947
01:18:36,558 --> 01:18:39,493
You've shed your blood
to save my daughter.

948
01:18:40,896 --> 01:18:45,924
l must've done a good deed to
get you in return from God.

949
01:18:48,404 --> 01:18:49,462
Thank you Raj.

950
01:18:52,374 --> 01:18:56,470
Brother Bakhtavar the
stake it too high.

951
01:18:56,812 --> 01:18:59,838
lt's around 45 million rupees.

952
01:19:02,251 --> 01:19:03,616
That's it friend.

953
01:19:04,486 --> 01:19:09,287
Even if my masseur goes in the
market and takes my name..

954
01:19:10,626 --> 01:19:14,687
..he can get that much money
before this glass gets empty.

955
01:19:16,298 --> 01:19:20,257
lf you're still not scared
ask me to show the cards.

956
01:19:20,569 --> 01:19:24,528
l'll end this game. Here.
Show the cards.

957
01:19:42,691 --> 01:19:44,420
Run! Get out.

958
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:46,418
Where's the lame man?

959
01:20:04,513 --> 01:20:05,605
Where's the lame man?

960
01:20:05,681 --> 01:20:06,705
l don't know.

961
01:20:15,524 --> 01:20:16,616
Tell me.

962
01:20:17,593 --> 01:20:19,117
Tell me where's the lame man?

963
01:20:19,228 --> 01:20:20,286
l don't know.

964
01:22:17,646 --> 01:22:21,343
Balraj!

965
01:22:39,730 --> 01:22:40,890
Raj!

966
01:22:41,899 --> 01:22:43,161
Did l hear it right?

967
01:22:43,367 --> 01:22:45,767
You neither had breakfast nor
medicine since morning.

968
01:22:45,837 --> 01:22:48,305
lf you don't eat properly
how will your wounds heal?

969
01:22:48,339 --> 01:22:51,103
Mother l was sitting.. Shut
up or else l'll slap you.

970
01:22:52,109 --> 01:22:54,976
You call me a mother but
don't listen to me.

971
01:22:55,346 --> 01:22:56,938
Drink this juice.

972
01:22:59,817 --> 01:23:01,284
What are you looking at?

973
01:23:03,020 --> 01:23:04,351
Maternal love.

974
01:23:06,691 --> 01:23:09,125
l lost my parents
in my childhood.

975
01:23:10,695 --> 01:23:13,721
l don't know what
maternal love is.

976
01:23:14,999 --> 01:23:18,730
Nobody scolded or fed
me with love before.

977
01:23:20,071 --> 01:23:22,039
And today on this
orphan you've..

978
01:23:22,106 --> 01:23:25,598
Don't! Don't dare to
say such things.

979
01:23:26,711 --> 01:23:28,941
l've considered you my son.

980
01:23:42,026 --> 01:23:44,995
Go son. Go and rest.

981
01:23:45,196 --> 01:23:46,254
Ok fine.

982
01:24:13,958 --> 01:24:15,220
Mom has sent me.

983
01:24:15,760 --> 01:24:19,719
She told me to inquire
about your health.

984
01:24:21,432 --> 01:24:23,366
There isn't much difference
in 10 minutes.

985
01:24:24,302 --> 01:24:26,167
By the way aunt just left.

986
01:24:31,275 --> 01:24:33,004
Won't you ask me to sit?

987
01:24:33,244 --> 01:24:36,270
lt's your house.
lsn't it yours?

988
01:24:36,647 --> 01:24:39,810
What's mine? l'm
just a stranger.

989
01:24:40,351 --> 01:24:42,012
God knows when l'll leave.

990
01:24:49,260 --> 01:24:52,752
lf you leave you'll be
accused of a murder.

991
01:24:58,169 --> 01:24:59,227
Whose murder?

992
01:24:59,270 --> 01:25:03,434
A stubborn snobbish and
silly girl's murder.

993
01:25:07,411 --> 01:25:11,404
lf something happens to
her l will die too.

994
01:25:52,089 --> 01:25:57,618
Your mischief and my weakness.

995
01:26:02,133 --> 01:26:06,797
Your mischief and my weakness.

996
01:26:07,104 --> 01:26:11,734
Your mischief and my weakness.

997
01:26:12,043 --> 01:26:17,003
Some day we'll be caught
for this crime.

998
01:26:22,086 --> 01:26:26,853
We neither broke nor
robbed any vault.

999
01:26:31,996 --> 01:26:36,865
We neither broke nor
robbed any vault.

1000
01:26:37,034 --> 01:26:41,733
We neither broke nor
robbed any vault.

1001
01:26:42,073 --> 01:26:46,874
Then why will we be caught?

1002
01:27:17,174 --> 01:27:21,838
l will rebel. This
is my promise.

1003
01:27:22,113 --> 01:27:26,948
But tell me about
your intentions.

1004
01:27:32,089 --> 01:27:36,753
l will rebel. This
is my promise.

1005
01:27:37,061 --> 01:27:41,998
But tell me about
your intentions.

1006
01:27:42,133 --> 01:27:46,797
lt's a deal of hearts. Nothing
can be forced on it.

1007
01:27:52,176 --> 01:27:57,011
lt's a deal of hearts. Nothing
can be forced on it.

1008
01:27:57,248 --> 01:28:01,878
lt's a deal of hearts. Nothing
can be forced on it.

1009
01:28:02,119 --> 01:28:07,056
Some day we'll be caught
for this crime.

1010
01:28:42,226 --> 01:28:46,890
Something will surely happen
in the prime of youth.

1011
01:28:47,331 --> 01:28:51,927
This is the story
of our love too.

1012
01:28:57,241 --> 01:29:01,871
Something will surely happen
in the prime of youth.

1013
01:29:02,279 --> 01:29:07,148
This is the story
of our love too.

1014
01:29:07,218 --> 01:29:12,383
We both are united
by this bond.

1015
01:29:17,294 --> 01:29:22,231
We both are united
by this bond.

1016
01:29:22,366 --> 01:29:27,167
We both are united
by this bond.

1017
01:29:27,271 --> 01:29:32,208
Then why will we be caught?

1018
01:29:37,248 --> 01:29:42,117
Your mischief and my weakness.

1019
01:29:42,186 --> 01:29:46,987
We neither broke nor
robbed any vault.

1020
01:29:47,291 --> 01:29:52,126
Some day we'll be caught
for this crime.

1021
01:30:15,786 --> 01:30:17,879
You said 'l'm a stranger.'

1022
01:30:18,389 --> 01:30:19,879
'God knows when l'll leave.'

1023
01:30:19,990 --> 01:30:22,185
Go away if you can.

1024
01:30:22,726 --> 01:30:25,286
Tell me. Can you go?

1025
01:30:25,996 --> 01:30:27,896
Why are you quiet? Answer me.

1026
01:30:28,032 --> 01:30:30,227
Answer me. Whom are
you talking to?

1027
01:30:31,335 --> 01:30:33,895

the book mom.

01:30:34,171 --> 01:30:36,264
Let me see your book.
Give it to me.

1029
01:30:36,640 --> 01:30:39,108
No mom. This isn't
your subject.

1030
01:30:39,176 --> 01:30:40,905
Let me see which subject
it is. Mom.

1031
01:30:40,978 --> 01:30:42,138
Give it to me.

1032
01:30:46,750 --> 01:30:49,617
The subject is nice.

1033
01:30:49,853 --> 01:30:51,013
But tell me something.

1034
01:30:51,221 --> 01:30:55,157
ls Raj only in your
book or.. Mom.

1035

Tell me. Answer me.
What did l hear?

1036
01:30:59,930 --> 01:31:02,330
That rogue has dared to
mislead my daughter.

1037
01:31:03,267 --> 01:31:06,725
This house feeds him and now
he wants to own this house.

1038
01:31:07,037 --> 01:31:09,904
Dad Raj isn't like this.
He's like that only.

1039
01:31:10,074 --> 01:31:12,941
He was waiting for a chance.
l knew his intentions.

1040
01:31:13,077 --> 01:31:14,305
l'll throw him out.

1041
01:31:14,411 --> 01:31:16,174
Dad please.. Shut up!

1042
01:31:16,447 --> 01:31:20,247
He's a rogue. No dad.
He's a decent boy.

1043
01:31:20,384 --> 01:31:22,750
No. He's not a decent boy.

1044
01:31:23,320 --> 01:31:25,117
He's a very decent boy.

1045
01:31:28,225 --> 01:31:30,625
You too! Dad!

1046
01:31:35,933 --> 01:31:38,128
Komal has changed these days.

1047
01:31:39,670 --> 01:31:42,002
She used to hate the mention
of your name.

1048
01:31:42,906 --> 01:31:45,204
But now she chants your name.

1049
01:31:47,378 --> 01:31:48,936
No matter what Raj..

1050
01:31:50,180 --> 01:31:52,375
..you've won everyone's heart.

1051
01:31:55,919 --> 01:31:57,181
Raj.

1052
01:31:58,288 --> 01:32:00,085
Komal is my only child.

1053
01:32:01,191 --> 01:32:04,217

her every wish.

1054

happiness is incomplete.

01:34:44,788 --> 01:34:46,619
Raj leave him.

1083
01:34:47,124 --> 01:34:49,149
Have you gone mad? Yes
sir. l've gone crazy.

1084
01:34:49,259 --> 01:34:50,783
Raj leave him.

1085
01:34:52,462 --> 01:34:54,157
Sir don't interfere.

1086
01:34:58,902 --> 01:35:01,735
How dare you raise
hands on Nihal!

1087
01:35:02,239 --> 01:35:03,638
Do you know him?

1088
01:35:04,274 --> 01:35:06,936
He's the one for whom
l've come here.

1089
01:35:07,878 --> 01:35:09,641
l've raised him like
my son. Like my son.

1090
01:35:10,113 --> 01:35:13,480
Like my son. lt's not possible.
lt's not possible sir.

1091
01:35:13,917 --> 01:35:15,942
Snakes can dwell on
sandalwood trees.

1092
01:35:16,086 --> 01:35:18,646
But a devil can't be raised in
an angel's house like you.

1093
01:35:18,722 --> 01:35:19,950
He's a devil. Devil!

1094
01:35:20,023 --> 01:35:21,422
You're crossing your limit Raj.

1095
01:35:21,692 --> 01:35:23,853
l can even face death
to get him.

1096
01:35:23,927 --> 01:35:26,828
Raj! What has he done?

1097
01:35:27,097 --> 01:35:28,860
Why are you getting
crazy to kill him?

1098
01:35:28,932 --> 01:35:30,297
You too can go mad.

1099
01:35:31,034 --> 01:35:34,094
lf someone tries to rape your
daughter in front of you..

1100
01:35:34,171 --> 01:35:35,866
..you too can go mad.

1101
01:35:35,973 --> 01:35:38,965
lf you can't help her
you too can go mad.

1102
01:35:39,309 --> 01:35:42,039
lf your daughter kills herself
in front of you..

1103
01:35:42,112 --> 01:35:43,409
.. you too can go mad.

1104
01:35:44,247 --> 01:35:46,272
And this incident took
place with me sir.

1105
01:35:47,684 --> 01:35:49,743
ln front of me my sister..

1106
01:35:54,625 --> 01:35:56,684
And it's all because
of this scum.

1107
01:35:56,860 --> 01:35:59,124
He tried to molest my sister.

1108
01:36:00,664 --> 01:36:02,063
He killed my sister.

1109
01:36:02,299 --> 01:36:04,893
Uncle he's lying. He's lying.

1110
01:36:05,268 --> 01:36:07,361
l'm meeting this man
for the first time.

1111
01:36:07,804 --> 01:36:09,431
l don't know his sister.

1112
01:36:09,740 --> 01:36:12,436
He's lying uncle. He's
falsely accusing me.

1113
01:36:12,676 --> 01:36:13,370
He's lying.

1114
01:36:14,111 --> 01:36:16,477
Check his neck. His neck
would have that wound.

1115
01:36:16,713 --> 01:36:19,181
His neck would have that wound.

1116
01:36:20,917 --> 01:36:22,407
'How did you get this wound?'

1117
01:36:22,719 --> 01:36:24,949
'l went to hunt with
friends. That..'

1118
01:36:25,122 --> 01:36:27,716
'lt doesn't seem to be a work
of some small animal.'

1119
01:36:28,125 --> 01:36:30,252
'Some lion must have pawed you.'

1120
01:36:30,427 --> 01:36:31,951
l won't spare him sir.

1121
01:36:34,064 --> 01:36:35,326
My mission is to kill him.

1122
01:36:36,700 --> 01:36:38,133
lt's impossible Raj.

1123
01:36:39,670 --> 01:36:42,230
Balraj is standing between..

1124
01:36:43,774 --> 01:36:45,298
..your vengeance and his life.

1125
01:36:46,710 --> 01:36:47,938
l'm his shield.

1126
01:36:49,613 --> 01:36:52,776
lt's my duty to protect him.

1127
01:36:53,717 --> 01:36:54,376
Ok sir.

1128
01:36:56,820 --> 01:36:58,048
You do your duty..

1129
01:36:59,423 --> 01:37:00,890
..and l'll do my duty.

1130
01:37:02,392 --> 01:37:03,916
Let the time decide.

1131
01:37:05,429 --> 01:37:07,863
Let's see if you can
save his life..

1132
01:37:09,733 --> 01:37:11,223
..or if l can kill him.

1133
01:37:20,210 --> 01:37:22,440
Uncle how do you know Raj?

1134
01:37:28,018 --> 01:37:29,713
What does he think of himself?

1135
01:37:29,953 --> 01:37:31,011
He's very strong?

1136
01:37:31,121 --> 01:37:33,316
You came in the middle
so l spared him.

1137
01:37:34,858 --> 01:37:35,950
Crazy!

1138
01:37:37,327 --> 01:37:38,351
Rogue!

1139
01:37:38,895 --> 01:37:40,021
Scoundrel!

1140
01:37:41,765 --> 01:37:43,027
His sister too was lowly!

1141
01:37:50,373 --> 01:37:52,864
You've guessed it without
seeing her.

1142
01:37:53,910 --> 01:37:56,435
You said you don't know
Raj and his sister.

1143
01:37:56,947 --> 01:37:58,744
l just guessed it.

1144
01:37:59,249 --> 01:38:01,649
lf brother is like this sister
too would've been like him.

1145
01:38:02,452 --> 01:38:03,441
Nihal..

1146
01:38:04,054 --> 01:38:06,181
..you've got a new life today.

1147
01:38:07,190 --> 01:38:10,717
lf you want to live
don't invite death.

1148
01:38:36,887 --> 01:38:37,945
You've come.

1149
01:38:38,054 --> 01:38:39,146
How are you Nihal?

1150
01:38:39,856 --> 01:38:40,914
Nihal?

1151
01:38:41,291 --> 01:38:42,656
What happened son?

1152
01:38:42,926 --> 01:38:45,121
And this.. What have you
done to yourself?

1153
01:38:45,228 --> 01:38:46,889
Who did this to you? Yes?

1154
01:38:48,031 --> 01:38:49,760
And Raj? Where is Raj?

1155
01:38:49,833 --> 01:38:51,300
Raj too was with you.

1156
01:38:51,668 --> 01:38:52,794
Nihal!

1157
01:38:52,903 --> 01:38:54,063
Go to your room.

1158
01:38:57,674 --> 01:38:59,369
Why don't you tell me about
Raj's whereabouts?

1159
01:39:56,433 --> 01:39:59,596
You've done injustice
on me heartless one!

1160
01:40:02,072 --> 01:40:05,132
You snatched everything
from me.

1161
01:40:13,216 --> 01:40:16,310
You've done injustice
on me heartless one!

1162
01:40:18,955 --> 01:40:22,152
You snatched everything
from me.

1163
01:40:23,894 --> 01:40:29,799
Tell me what do you want?

1164
01:40:32,936 --> 01:40:35,905
You've done injustice
on me heartless one!

1165
01:40:38,375 --> 01:40:41,902
You snatched everything
from me.

1166
01:41:09,706 --> 01:41:14,734
l've adorned for nobody
else but you.

1167
01:41:15,078 --> 01:41:19,981
Praise me and learn
to please me.

1168
01:41:20,150 --> 01:41:25,986
Lift my veil and embrace me.

1169
01:41:29,025 --> 01:41:32,051
You've done injustice
on me heartless one!

1170
01:41:34,230 --> 01:41:38,599
You snatched everything
from me.

1171
01:42:19,743 --> 01:42:24,840
Consider it my favour as
l endure your tantrums.

1172
01:42:25,248 --> 01:42:30,151
l don't know what you
think of yourself.

1173
01:42:30,286 --> 01:42:36,282
l can't control my heart.
lt loves only you.

1174
01:42:39,329 --> 01:42:42,765
You've done injustice
on me heartless one!

1175
01:42:44,667 --> 01:42:48,159
You snatched everything
from me.

1176
01:42:50,240 --> 01:42:55,735
Tell me what do you want?

1177
01:42:58,748 --> 01:43:02,275
You've done injustice
on me heartless one!

1178
01:43:04,254 --> 01:43:08,350
You snatched everything
from me.

1179
01:43:10,260 --> 01:43:13,718
You've done injustice
on me heartless one!

1180
01:43:15,899 --> 01:43:19,665
You snatched everything
from me.

1181
01:43:34,717 --> 01:43:35,843
Sorry.

1182
01:44:03,346 --> 01:44:04,404
Raj.

1183
01:44:07,283 --> 01:44:08,375
l'm sorry.

1184
01:44:09,085 --> 01:44:11,349
l shouldn't have behaved
like this with you.

1185
01:44:11,888 --> 01:44:14,015
l've no complaint against
your behaviour.

1186
01:44:15,258 --> 01:44:17,726
l'm worried because..

1187
01:44:18,862 --> 01:44:22,161
..l don't know what pain has
wiped the smile from your face.

1188
01:44:22,298 --> 01:44:24,129
Smile is a small thing.

1189
01:44:26,035 --> 01:44:27,798
l might even lose my life in it.

1190
01:44:27,904 --> 01:44:28,962
No Raj.

1191
01:44:29,205 --> 01:44:31,105
lt's not just your life now.

1192
01:44:31,741 --> 01:44:33,106
l too have a right on it.

1193
01:44:34,043 --> 01:44:35,237
l've loved you.

1194
01:44:35,945 --> 01:44:39,881
And lovers share both
life and death.

1195
01:44:40,950 --> 01:44:42,315
l bind you with my oath.

1196
01:44:42,752 --> 01:44:45,312
Who is the one who is
snatching my joy..

1197
01:44:45,388 --> 01:44:46,787
..by giving you sorrow?

1198
01:44:50,160 --> 01:44:51,923
My sister's killer.

1199
01:44:52,328 --> 01:44:53,386
Nihal!

1200
01:45:00,937 --> 01:45:02,029
Oh God!

1201
01:45:02,872 --> 01:45:05,067
lt was very bad.

1202
01:45:05,308 --> 01:45:09,404
But Sumitra the future
will be worse.

1203
01:45:11,247 --> 01:45:13,010
Raj is obsessed with revenge.

1204
01:45:13,983 --> 01:45:16,315
God forbid but if something
happens to Nihal..

1205
01:45:17,353 --> 01:45:19,685
..my life will be
worse than death.

1206
01:45:20,089 --> 01:45:22,057
God forbid but if something
happens to Raj..

1207
01:45:22,425 --> 01:45:23,949
..what will happen
to our daughter?

1208
01:45:23,993 --> 01:45:25,858
Didn't you think of that? Mom.

1209
01:45:26,863 --> 01:45:30,060
Do you know Nihal had
killed Raj's sister?

1210
01:45:31,234 --> 01:45:33,828
Yes. How can we live with him..

1211
01:45:33,903 --> 01:45:35,803
..after knowing that
he's a killer.

1212
01:45:36,372 --> 01:45:38,431
After all what's this
helplessness?

1213
01:45:39,108 --> 01:45:40,075
Dad tell me.

1214
01:45:41,911 --> 01:45:43,242
Why are you quiet?

1215
01:45:44,080 --> 01:45:47,413
lt means you care more
for that killer..

1216
01:45:47,750 --> 01:45:49,183
..than your daughter's
happiness.

1217
01:45:49,652 --> 01:45:52,348
That outsider is dearer to you
than your blood relative.

1218
01:45:52,855 --> 01:45:53,981
Tell me.

1219
01:45:56,226 --> 01:45:57,818
Yes? Yes child.

1220
01:45:58,127 --> 01:46:02,086
Loyalty is stronger than blood
relations in this house.

1221
01:46:04,167 --> 01:46:08,331
To fulfil that duty your
dad can sacrifice..

1222
01:46:09,672 --> 01:46:11,697
..not just you and me
but his own life too.

1223
01:46:13,309 --> 01:46:18,872
lt's in everyone's favour if
you.. if you forget Raj.

1224
01:46:19,916 --> 01:46:21,042
Yes child.

1225
01:46:22,418 --> 01:46:23,646
Mom!

1226
01:46:42,005 --> 01:46:47,910
The mistake l did by mistake..

1227
01:46:48,978 --> 01:46:55,440
..will never be forgotten
in this life.

1228
01:46:56,452 --> 01:47:02,823
The mistake l did by mistake..

1229
01:47:03,860 --> 01:47:10,789
..will never be forgotten
in this life.

1230
01:47:11,301 --> 01:47:18,230
We didn't know that
in our journey..

1231
01:47:19,142 --> 01:47:25,741
..we've have to face
this juncture.

1232
01:47:27,317 --> 01:47:28,375
Brother!

1233
01:47:28,785 --> 01:47:29,979
Brother!

1234
01:47:31,020 --> 01:47:32,282
No!

1235
01:49:08,718 --> 01:49:10,686
Raj! Nihal!

1236
01:49:11,087 --> 01:49:12,315
What's happening inside?

1237
01:49:13,289 --> 01:49:14,381
Raj open the door.

1238
01:49:15,091 --> 01:49:16,422
Raj open the door.

1239
01:49:18,227 --> 01:49:20,252
Raj open the door.

1240
01:49:21,197 --> 01:49:22,721
Raj open the door.

1241
01:49:23,766 --> 01:49:25,028
Raj open the door.

1242
01:49:26,002 --> 01:49:27,401
Open the door.

1243
01:49:29,305 --> 01:49:31,830
Raj! Uncle! Uncle!

1244
01:49:33,042 --> 01:49:34,168
Raj open the door!

1245
01:49:34,243 --> 01:49:37,406
Sir has lessened your suffering
or else l would have..

1246
01:49:40,950 --> 01:49:42,144
How dare you!

1247
01:49:42,885 --> 01:49:45,319
You tried to barge in my
house and kill him.

1248
01:49:45,955 --> 01:49:47,946
Do you know what could've
been the consequence?

1249
01:49:48,257 --> 01:49:50,782
My guards could've
shot you. Or l..

1250
01:49:50,860 --> 01:49:52,157
Kill me sir. Kill me.

1251
01:49:52,295 --> 01:49:54,820
Because my life is worse than
death till he's alive.

1252
01:49:54,997 --> 01:49:57,056
Why do you want to get
yourself killed?

1253
01:49:57,166 --> 01:49:59,964
l'm more interested in his
death than my own life.

1254
01:50:00,169 --> 01:50:02,694
Not once or two but l'll
try thousand times..

1255
01:50:02,772 --> 01:50:03,932
..but l'll kill him.

1256
01:50:04,941 --> 01:50:08,274
There would be a day when you
won't come between us. Yes.

1257
01:50:08,945 --> 01:50:10,344
Such a day will come.

1258
01:50:10,913 --> 01:50:12,744
Such a day will surely
come Raj.

1259
01:50:13,716 --> 01:50:16,810
But on that day Balraj
Dutt won't be alive.

1260
01:50:17,420 --> 01:50:19,752
You can kill him after my death.

1261
01:50:21,057 --> 01:50:26,154
And along with that kill those
members who respected you..

1262
01:50:26,762 --> 01:50:29,162
..honoured you and loved you.

1263
01:50:30,633 --> 01:50:33,363
Because these words mean
nothing to you now.

1264
01:50:44,814 --> 01:50:46,611
Don't be foolish Nihal.

1265
01:50:46,916 --> 01:50:47,905
Leave me uncle.

1266
01:50:48,384 --> 01:50:50,375
Leave me. Leave me.

1267
01:50:51,020 --> 01:50:52,385
How long will l've to fear him?

1268
01:50:53,089 --> 01:50:55,614
Henceforth l won't have
to fear to escape him..

1269
01:50:56,225 --> 01:50:59,126
..nor he would have to take
trouble to reach me.

1270
01:50:59,862 --> 01:51:02,194
l'll end the story today.
l'll kill him.

1271
01:51:02,298 --> 01:51:03,822
Come to your senses Nihal.

1272
01:51:05,067 --> 01:51:09,367
l want to save you but you want
to enter the jaws of death.

1273
01:51:09,939 --> 01:51:10,997
ldiot!

1274
01:51:13,643 --> 01:51:14,837
Good morning sir.

1275
01:51:15,011 --> 01:51:16,308
Good morning Vikram.

1276
01:51:16,812 --> 01:51:18,609
Sir you called for
me. Order me.

1277
01:51:19,448 --> 01:51:20,745
Not an order..

1278
01:51:21,417 --> 01:51:23,817
..but l've called you
to do me a favour.

1279
01:51:24,020 --> 01:51:25,078
Favour?

1280
01:51:25,354 --> 01:51:26,878
Sit. Ok.

1281
01:51:28,824 --> 01:51:30,155
Vikram. Yes?

1282
01:51:31,093 --> 01:51:32,583
lf you help me..

1283
01:51:33,663 --> 01:51:36,188
..a decent man will be saved
from becoming a criminal.

1284
01:51:37,199 --> 01:51:39,326
Sir l'm always ready
for such good deeds.

1285
01:51:40,369 --> 01:51:41,631
Good.

1286
01:51:43,606 --> 01:51:45,073
Arrest this boy.

1287
01:51:46,909 --> 01:51:49,776
But he shouldn't face any
problem in prison.

1288
01:51:50,947 --> 01:51:53,814
He shouldn't face any problem
in prison? Yes.

1289
01:51:54,383 --> 01:51:55,611
But what has he done?

1290
01:51:55,685 --> 01:51:57,710
He has not done it
yet. He'll do it.

1291
01:51:59,155 --> 01:52:01,646
He wants to kill. Kill? Whom?

1292
01:52:01,857 --> 01:52:03,154
ls it necessary to know that?

1293
01:52:03,926 --> 01:52:08,625
Sir if l'm not wrong you want
to save both the lives.

1294
01:52:08,965 --> 01:52:10,728
Am l right sir? Yes.

1295
01:52:27,650 --> 01:52:29,845
l must arrest you Mr. Raj.

1296
01:52:32,221 --> 01:52:33,313
For what crime?

1297
01:52:33,689 --> 01:52:38,649
Balraj has filed a report you
threatened to kill someone.

1298
01:52:38,728 --> 01:52:39,922
Didn't you?

1299
01:52:40,229 --> 01:52:41,787
Not just a threat..

1300
01:52:43,132 --> 01:52:44,724
..l'll surely kill him.

1301
01:52:46,202 --> 01:52:49,433
No power in this world can
stop me. Stop Mr. Raj.

1302
01:52:50,006 --> 01:52:51,098
Or else l'll shoot.

1303
01:52:52,975 --> 01:52:54,272
lnstead of warning me..

1304
01:52:56,646 --> 01:52:58,079
..you should've shot me.

1305
01:52:58,814 --> 01:52:59,872
lnspector.

1306
01:53:00,750 --> 01:53:02,411
You talk a lot.

1307
01:53:03,753 --> 01:53:04,811
Nab him!

1308
01:53:40,656 --> 01:53:41,918
Thanks for the favour.

1309
01:53:42,324 --> 01:53:44,815
You don't have to
thank me friend.

1310
01:53:45,461 --> 01:53:49,124
Because l've did a favour
on myself by saving you.

1311
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:52,297
As far as l know.

1312
01:53:53,202 --> 01:53:54,464
..l never met you earlier.

1313
01:53:56,972 --> 01:53:58,269
You're right friend.

1314
01:53:59,141 --> 01:54:00,335
You're right.

1315
01:54:01,377 --> 01:54:03,868
You know nothing about me.

1316
01:54:04,447 --> 01:54:08,315
But Zoravar knows everything
about you.

1317
01:54:08,818 --> 01:54:10,786
What's the reason of this
interest? Death.

1318
01:54:11,420 --> 01:54:14,389
Whose? You must've heard
a story in childhood.

1319
01:54:15,725 --> 01:54:16,919
There was a snake..

1320
01:54:17,893 --> 01:54:20,760
..which used to feed
on a crow's eggs.

1321
01:54:21,263 --> 01:54:23,663
To save her eggs..

1322
01:54:24,133 --> 01:54:26,192
..crow fled with the
queen's necklace.

1323
01:54:26,936 --> 01:54:28,836
Soldiers chased the crow.

1324
01:54:29,338 --> 01:54:32,068
Crow dropped the necklace
in the snake's hole.

1325
01:54:32,742 --> 01:54:34,437
To get the necklace..

1326
01:54:35,211 --> 01:54:37,270
..soldiers killed the snake.

1327
01:54:37,847 --> 01:54:39,109
Queen got her necklace.

1328
01:54:39,648 --> 01:54:41,275
And crow got rid of the snake.

1329
01:54:41,751 --> 01:54:45,414
l understood that you're
the crow of this story.

1330
01:54:46,722 --> 01:54:48,849
Now tell me the snake's name.

1331
01:54:49,125 --> 01:54:53,687
He's the one who is guarding
your enemy.

1332
01:54:54,296 --> 01:54:55,422
Balraj Dutt!

1333
01:55:01,771 --> 01:55:04,433
My grip could've been
so firm that..

1334
01:55:04,707 --> 01:55:06,698
..you could've died too.

1335
01:55:07,810 --> 01:55:12,372
l'm sparing you because you
helped me a while ago.

1336
01:55:15,117 --> 01:55:17,312
As for Balraj Dutt..

1337
01:55:18,220 --> 01:55:20,688
..don't consider him a snake.

1338
01:55:21,924 --> 01:55:24,188
He's a python. Python.

1339
01:55:25,828 --> 01:55:28,763
And pythons don't bite.
They swallow.

1340
01:55:29,632 --> 01:55:31,224
Don't go close to him..

1341
01:55:32,168 --> 01:55:34,363
..or your existence
will be wiped out.

1342
01:55:38,207 --> 01:55:39,606
Got it you crow?

1343
01:55:53,255 --> 01:55:54,882
Hello. Greetings mother.

1344
01:55:54,990 --> 01:55:56,890
Raj! Raj!

1345
01:55:57,159 --> 01:55:58,990
Where are you? Where are
you speaking from?

1346
01:55:59,128 --> 01:56:00,720
Don't worry about me mother.

1347
01:56:01,697 --> 01:56:04,666
You call me mother but
tell me not to worry.

1348
01:56:05,968 --> 01:56:08,766
Are you all right? Yes
mother. l'm fine.

1349
01:56:09,405 --> 01:56:11,236
Just take care of sir.

1350
01:56:12,208 --> 01:56:14,233
How can l take care of sir?

1351
01:56:14,977 --> 01:56:17,036
He has forgotten his
wife and daughter..

1352
01:56:17,713 --> 01:56:19,738
..for taking care
of someone else.

1353
01:56:21,851 --> 01:56:23,716
No mother. lt is not so.

1354
01:56:24,286 --> 01:56:27,016
He loves us a lot
but he's helpless.

1355
01:56:27,857 --> 01:56:29,051
That's it.

1356
01:56:29,425 --> 01:56:30,858
Sir's life is in danger.

1357
01:56:31,026 --> 01:56:33,392
What? What are you saying?

1358
01:56:33,762 --> 01:56:34,786
Yes mother.

1359
01:56:35,064 --> 01:56:37,794
There.. There's a lame man.

1360
01:56:38,901 --> 01:56:40,926
l think he's sir's old enemy.

1361
01:56:41,036 --> 01:56:42,162
A lame man.

1362
01:56:43,439 --> 01:56:45,805
Was.. Was he Zoravar?

1363
01:56:47,376 --> 01:56:50,243
Yes. Maybe that's his
name. Zoravar.

1364
01:56:51,380 --> 01:56:54,008
He considered my and sir's
conflict as enmity.

1365
01:56:54,316 --> 01:56:56,181
And he wanted me to join him.

1366
01:56:56,385 --> 01:56:57,750
Believe me.

1367
01:56:59,154 --> 01:57:00,644
You've called me a son.

1368
01:57:02,291 --> 01:57:05,021
So l too have considered
him a father.

1369
01:57:06,295 --> 01:57:08,627
Won't let your husband
be harmed..

1370
01:57:10,232 --> 01:57:12,132
..as long as l'm alive.

1371
01:57:13,335 --> 01:57:15,030
l'm away from you..

1372
01:57:16,338 --> 01:57:17,669
..but not separate.

1373
01:57:20,042 --> 01:57:21,771
Tell sir..

1374
01:57:22,778 --> 01:57:23,802
..to be careful.

1375
01:57:25,147 --> 01:57:26,045
Hello.

1376
01:57:26,682 --> 01:57:27,910
Hello Raj.

1377
01:57:52,374 --> 01:57:53,636
Raj.

1378
01:58:03,986 --> 01:58:06,318
l've realized your greatness.

1379
01:58:08,390 --> 01:58:13,293
But l've come to you so save
myself from embarrassment.

1380
01:58:13,929 --> 01:58:14,953
Son.

1381
01:58:18,634 --> 01:58:22,661
l agree that whatever happened
to you was wrong.

1382
01:58:24,740 --> 01:58:28,301
And whatever you are
doing is right.

1383
01:58:30,112 --> 01:58:34,048
But what l am doing
isn't wrong either.

1384
01:58:37,386 --> 01:58:39,980
l'm unfortunate as l'll
lose on both the sides.

1385
01:58:43,292 --> 01:58:45,089
Forget that past incident.

1386
01:58:47,062 --> 01:58:50,429
lf you dig up the past
you'll hurt yourself.

1387
01:58:51,734 --> 01:58:52,723
You'll feel the pain.

1388
01:58:55,104 --> 01:58:56,366
And God knows..

1389
01:58:57,840 --> 01:59:01,332
..that your pain is my pain.

1390
01:59:06,715 --> 01:59:07,773
Son.

1391
01:59:09,084 --> 01:59:10,949
Don't tread that path..

1392
01:59:12,021 --> 01:59:14,251
..which leads only
to destruction.

1393
01:59:15,758 --> 01:59:17,055
Stop yourself.

1394
01:59:17,993 --> 01:59:19,324
Change your intentions.

1395
01:59:20,329 --> 01:59:21,660
That's all.

1396
01:59:22,731 --> 01:59:24,824
l came to make this request.

1397
01:59:29,938 --> 01:59:31,997
l appreciate your feelings.

1398
01:59:33,909 --> 01:59:35,604
l just have one answer.

1399
01:59:37,646 --> 01:59:41,047
lf you had been in my place
what would you've done?

1400
01:59:50,993 --> 01:59:53,325
lf l had answer to
this question..

1401
01:59:54,630 --> 01:59:56,325
..l wouldn't have come to you.

1402
02:00:02,938 --> 02:00:05,031
Where are you going? Outside.

1403
02:00:06,108 --> 02:00:09,009
Even though you know your life
will be in danger outside.

1404
02:00:09,678 --> 02:00:11,145
lsn't danger inside this house?

1405
02:00:11,880 --> 02:00:13,279
Meaning? Yes.

1406
02:00:14,216 --> 02:00:16,844
These walls aren't too
high to stop death.

1407
02:00:17,653 --> 02:00:21,919
l am not a coward to live as
a prisoner fearing him.

1408
02:00:22,324 --> 02:00:23,621
l'm feeling suffocated.

1409
02:00:23,826 --> 02:00:25,589
l'm tired of seeing
the same faces.

1410
02:00:26,228 --> 02:00:28,355
l don't want fear helplessness
and support.

1411
02:00:28,630 --> 02:00:30,689
l want freedom and
pleasure in life.

1412
02:00:31,900 --> 02:00:34,368
You lost this right the
day an innocent girl..

1413
02:00:35,237 --> 02:00:37,899
..died because of you.

1414
02:00:39,208 --> 02:00:42,974
As for prisoner you're
not a prisoner Nihal.

1415
02:00:43,812 --> 02:00:45,609
l'm a prisoner bonded
by my oath.

1416
02:00:46,148 --> 02:00:48,378
That's why l'm protecting
a culprit.

1417
02:00:49,184 --> 02:00:51,709
Because that culprit is
Mr. Thakur's grandson.

1418
02:00:52,754 --> 02:00:54,915
So today let's clear this
misunderstanding too.

1419
02:00:55,824 --> 02:00:57,849
We both are each other's target.

1420
02:00:58,660 --> 02:01:00,719
Now whether Raj or Nihal fires..

1421
02:01:01,897 --> 02:01:03,364
..you'll surely get a corpse.

1422
02:01:23,585 --> 02:01:25,348
When mind is filled with anger..

1423
02:01:27,256 --> 02:01:28,848
..and eyes with hatred..

1424
02:01:30,959 --> 02:01:33,587
..you can't hit the
target Mr. Nihal.

1425
02:01:34,730 --> 02:01:36,698
How do you know my name? Name?

1426
02:01:39,768 --> 02:01:45,001
Zoravar knows more than
you about yourself.

1427
02:02:15,337 --> 02:02:17,032
lt's not poisoned friend.

1428
02:02:18,006 --> 02:02:19,735
Your life is in danger friend.

1429
02:02:22,978 --> 02:02:24,878
lf you consider me friend
come to the point.

1430
02:02:25,314 --> 02:02:26,440
Don't speak in riddles.

1431
02:02:28,917 --> 02:02:30,646
lt's very clear friend.

1432
02:02:37,426 --> 02:02:40,657
Balraj Dutt won't like
to lose Mr. Thakur's..

1433
02:02:40,729 --> 02:02:43,664
..property worth millions
of rupees.

1434
02:02:44,800 --> 02:02:48,258
So to kill you he
has chosen a man..

1435
02:02:49,271 --> 02:02:51,933
..who already wanted
to kill you.

1436
02:02:52,474 --> 02:02:54,305
And on top of that..

1437
02:02:55,310 --> 02:02:58,108
..he wants to make him
his soninlaw.

1438
02:02:58,880 --> 02:03:04,841
Once Raj kills you Raj
will get married.

1439
02:03:06,121 --> 02:03:10,820
Both of them will share the
property worth millions.

1440
02:03:18,934 --> 02:03:22,131
lf you don't believe
Zoravar go.

1441
02:03:22,938 --> 02:03:24,235
Go friend. Go.

1442
02:03:25,374 --> 02:03:28,104
Ask Balraj Dutt for
something that's..

1443
02:03:29,044 --> 02:03:32,275
..more precious than
Mr. Thakur's property.

1444
02:03:33,015 --> 02:03:34,073
Go!

1445
02:04:03,812 --> 02:04:04,870
This..

1446
02:04:05,714 --> 02:04:07,477
Why have you posted
these men with me?

1447
02:04:10,719 --> 02:04:12,949
To protect you. Really?

1448
02:04:13,922 --> 02:04:15,355
Who is a threat to me?

1449
02:04:16,358 --> 02:04:18,952
That enemy who is outside
the house..

1450
02:04:19,828 --> 02:04:20,886
..or..

1451
02:04:21,997 --> 02:04:23,828
..the one who is inside
the house.

1452
02:04:28,437 --> 02:04:30,098
You're not in your
senses right now.

1453
02:04:30,138 --> 02:04:31,969
l've come to my senses
today Mr. Balraj.

1454
02:04:33,141 --> 02:04:34,665
l've come to my senses today.

1455
02:04:35,744 --> 02:04:37,211
Today l've found out that..

1456
02:04:38,246 --> 02:04:41,977
..you just pretend
to protect me.

1457
02:04:42,684 --> 02:04:43,651
lt's a sham.

1458
02:04:44,786 --> 02:04:48,847
These men following me
aren't to protect me..

1459
02:04:49,991 --> 02:04:53,392
..but to protect Raj so
that l don't shoot him.

1460
02:04:53,829 --> 02:04:56,821
lt's not your fault
but of the liquor.

1461
02:04:57,432 --> 02:04:59,866
That's why you fail to
recognise your own.

1462
02:04:59,935 --> 02:05:02,267
My own! Who is my own?

1463
02:05:03,405 --> 02:05:04,895
This is a materialistic world.

1464
02:05:05,941 --> 02:05:08,967
Every man here wants a price
for his loyalty and labour.

1465
02:05:09,778 --> 02:05:11,211
lf you considered me your own..

1466
02:05:11,413 --> 02:05:14,007
..you wouldn't have saved that
scum's life that day..

1467
02:05:14,182 --> 02:05:15,649
..when l aimed at him.

1468
02:05:15,951 --> 02:05:17,646
You should've let him die.

1469
02:05:18,153 --> 02:05:19,745
But you didn't do so.

1470
02:05:20,822 --> 02:05:23,791
Because he is your
daughter's lover.

1471
02:05:24,860 --> 02:05:26,293
Your tobe soninlaw.

1472
02:05:26,762 --> 02:05:27,854
Yes.

1473
02:05:29,264 --> 02:05:31,960
lt's true that Raj
loves my daughter.

1474
02:05:33,335 --> 02:05:35,667
lt's true that l want
to save him.

1475
02:05:36,338 --> 02:05:41,241
lt's also true that to save your
life l can kill anyone..

1476
02:05:41,276 --> 02:05:43,744
..and even give up my life.
Give me your life.

1477
02:05:44,413 --> 02:05:45,880
Give me your life.

1478
02:05:46,214 --> 02:05:48,409
Get your daughter married
to me. Nihal!

1479
02:05:48,683 --> 02:05:49,945
Nihal!

1480
02:05:54,222 --> 02:05:57,214
Don't dare to mention
my daughter.

1481
02:05:58,326 --> 02:06:01,295
l promised Mr. Thakur
to save your life..

1482
02:06:02,097 --> 02:06:04,964
..not to marry a demon like
you to my daughter.

1483
02:06:06,201 --> 02:06:07,361
That's it.

1484
02:06:08,437 --> 02:06:10,302
You've shown your true colours.

1485
02:06:10,972 --> 02:06:12,667
You've shown your true self.

1486
02:06:13,408 --> 02:06:16,138
You can't do this
Mr. Balraj Dutt.

1487
02:06:17,412 --> 02:06:20,279
Because l'm the biggest
hurdle in your path.

1488
02:06:21,883 --> 02:06:24,181
You want to get my wealth
after killing me.

1489
02:06:24,352 --> 02:06:25,876
What did you say?

1490
02:06:26,855 --> 02:06:28,652
l want to kill you.

1491
02:06:31,193 --> 02:06:32,421
Do you hear uncle?

1492
02:06:33,261 --> 02:06:34,956
He is saying that..

1493
02:06:35,664 --> 02:06:38,963
..l want to kill him and
seize all this property.

1494
02:06:40,836 --> 02:06:41,894
Uncle!

1495
02:06:42,637 --> 02:06:46,869
lf l was greedy for wealth
l would've killed him..

1496
02:06:47,742 --> 02:06:49,733
..the day you handed me to him.

1497
02:06:52,013 --> 02:06:55,744
God knows that l've carried
my responsibilities..

1498
02:06:55,817 --> 02:06:58,115
..and promise diligently.

1499
02:06:59,421 --> 02:07:02,390
Still he has called me
lowly and traitor.

1500
02:07:02,858 --> 02:07:04,018
He has insulted me.

1501
02:07:05,994 --> 02:07:08,258
Why are you pleading in front
of this lifeless portrait?

1502
02:07:10,198 --> 02:07:11,256
Nihal!

1503
02:07:13,068 --> 02:07:15,298
lf you hadn't been
uncle's grandson..

1504
02:07:16,671 --> 02:07:19,196
..l would've broken your arm.

1505
02:07:20,342 --> 02:07:24,278
Before l lose my control
get out of here.

1506
02:07:25,914 --> 02:07:26,972
Nihal!

1507
02:07:27,415 --> 02:07:28,939
Sorry. Sorry Nihal.

1508
02:07:29,084 --> 02:07:30,108
Move aside.

1509
02:07:30,952 --> 02:07:35,082
Save this sympathy for the
one whom l'll kill.

1510
02:07:35,590 --> 02:07:36,648
Move!

1511
02:08:17,332 --> 02:08:19,163
Come friend. Come. Come.

1512
02:08:21,937 --> 02:08:22,904
Friend?

1513
02:08:23,004 --> 02:08:26,201
Who has wounded my
friend's forehead?

1514
02:08:26,608 --> 02:08:28,838
l'll behead that scum.

1515
02:08:29,044 --> 02:08:30,306
Tell me who has done it.

1516
02:08:31,112 --> 02:08:32,136
No Zoravar.

1517
02:08:33,381 --> 02:08:35,042
Don't treat this wound.

1518
02:08:35,183 --> 02:08:36,275
Don't be mad friend.

1519
02:08:36,952 --> 02:08:38,852
lf you don't treat it
poison will spread.

1520
02:08:39,087 --> 02:08:41,681
Let it spread. Let this
poison spread.

1521
02:08:42,691 --> 02:08:44,386
The more this poison spreads..

1522
02:08:45,160 --> 02:08:47,822
..the more l'll crave
for revenge.

1523
02:08:48,730 --> 02:08:51,164
l'll incinerate that old man..

1524
02:08:51,633 --> 02:08:52,827
..who gave me this wound.

1525
02:08:53,168 --> 02:08:55,102
You're not alone in this
battle friend.

1526
02:08:56,071 --> 02:08:58,039
You're not alone in this battle.

1527
02:08:58,940 --> 02:09:02,000
Balraj Dutt's time is up.

1528
02:09:02,944 --> 02:09:04,002
Now watch.

1529
02:09:04,412 --> 02:09:08,405
l'll make him dance
like this ball.

1530
02:09:13,755 --> 02:09:14,813
Sumitra!

1531
02:09:15,957 --> 02:09:17,015
Sumitra!

1532
02:09:17,959 --> 02:09:19,017
Sumitra!

1533
02:09:19,995 --> 02:09:21,257
Where is Komal?

1534
02:09:24,799 --> 02:09:26,630
l said where is Komal?

1535
02:09:27,068 --> 02:09:28,933
You really don't know
where Komal is?

1536
02:09:29,638 --> 02:09:30,935
What do you mean?

1537
02:09:31,773 --> 02:09:33,138
She went to meet Raj.

1538
02:09:34,109 --> 02:09:35,770
Why didn't you stop her?

1539
02:09:36,378 --> 02:09:38,403
l can't stop the storm.

1540
02:09:43,985 --> 02:09:45,612
Nobody cares for me.

1541
02:09:46,187 --> 02:09:49,088
Someone is fulfilling his duty
and someone his obligation.

1542
02:09:51,226 --> 02:09:53,285
And in this struggle
l'm getting hurt.

1543
02:09:53,795 --> 02:09:55,353
Why? l want to know why?

1544
02:09:55,764 --> 02:09:57,061
What's my fault in this?

1545
02:09:57,999 --> 02:10:01,730
Am l getting punished for being
Balraj Dutt's daughter?

1546
02:10:02,737 --> 02:10:06,195
ls it a crime that
l've loved you?

1547
02:10:07,042 --> 02:10:08,100
Tell me.

1548
02:10:08,943 --> 02:10:10,001
Tell me Raj.

1549
02:10:19,120 --> 02:10:21,782
Yes you've committed a crime
by running away from home.

1550
02:10:24,159 --> 02:10:27,959
You should take care of your
dad and his honour.

1551
02:10:29,130 --> 02:10:30,757
He is not against our love.

1552
02:10:32,133 --> 02:10:33,725
Nor am l away from you.

1553
02:10:35,303 --> 02:10:38,602
Only my death can separate
me from you.

1554
02:10:39,074 --> 02:10:40,132
Raj!

1555
02:10:46,614 --> 02:10:49,139
l bind you with my
oath. Return home.

1556
02:11:22,784 --> 02:11:24,945
ls this the modest way
to enter the house?

1557
02:11:25,186 --> 02:11:29,850
To enter enemy's house we
need power not modesty.

1558
02:11:31,693 --> 02:11:33,991
And l'm his power Balraj.

1559
02:11:35,597 --> 02:11:36,655
Look.

1560
02:11:37,198 --> 02:11:39,996
l'm standing in front
of you in your house.

1561
02:11:41,369 --> 02:11:43,633
People say the joy
of killing enemy..

1562
02:11:43,738 --> 02:11:48,038
..in his own house is
great Balraj Dutt.

1563
02:11:52,347 --> 02:11:56,147
l think your fingers can no
longer hold the crutches.

1564
02:11:56,951 --> 02:11:59,385
That's why you've
come to die here.

1565
02:12:03,892 --> 02:12:06,326
This bullet could've pierced
your heart too Balraj.

1566
02:12:07,195 --> 02:12:09,857
But you're not destined
to die so easily.

1567
02:12:11,199 --> 02:12:12,393
Why are you standing friend?

1568
02:12:12,667 --> 02:12:14,760
Go and abduct his daughter.

1569
02:12:16,104 --> 02:12:17,162
Nihal!

1570
02:12:17,839 --> 02:12:19,238
Are you in your senses?

1571
02:12:19,707 --> 02:12:22,676
You're going to act so
lowly on his behest.

1572
02:12:23,211 --> 02:12:24,269
Do you know him?

1573
02:12:24,412 --> 02:12:26,107
Don't listen to his
nonsense friend.

1574
02:12:26,281 --> 02:12:28,749
Abduct the girl. Don't
dare to do it Nihal!

1575
02:12:28,950 --> 02:12:30,417
lf you step any further..

1576
02:12:30,785 --> 02:12:33,049
Why have you stopped
friend? Go.

1577
02:12:33,655 --> 02:12:36,453
Nihal you want to dishonour
your own family member.

1578
02:12:36,825 --> 02:12:38,053
Get aside.

1579
02:12:39,394 --> 02:12:40,759
lnsolent!

1580
02:12:44,232 --> 02:12:45,290
Nihal!

1581
02:12:55,777 --> 02:12:58,712
Move! Sumitra! Sumitra!

1582
02:13:02,984 --> 02:13:09,321
Think of the pain when Nihal
will shoot you Balraj Dutt.

1583
02:13:09,958 --> 02:13:11,858
Don't count on it Zoravar.

1584
02:13:12,760 --> 02:13:15,228
l've raised him with my love.

1585
02:13:16,064 --> 02:13:18,055
My maternal love can't
be in vain.

1586
02:13:18,199 --> 02:13:19,291
Maternal love?

1587
02:13:21,102 --> 02:13:23,866
l've turned that love
into hatred long ago.

1588
02:13:26,975 --> 02:13:29,705
l can sense the fear of
death in your laughter.

1589
02:13:30,879 --> 02:13:34,679
Yes Zoravar. You've become
so handicapped..

1590
02:13:34,983 --> 02:13:37,281
..that you can't do anything
without anyone's support.

1591
02:13:38,152 --> 02:13:39,983
That's why you misguided Nihal.

1592
02:13:41,122 --> 02:13:43,454
But you're not destined to win.

1593
02:13:44,359 --> 02:13:46,884
First you lost your leg
then your brother.

1594
02:13:47,262 --> 02:13:48,991
Now you've come here to die.

1595
02:13:49,197 --> 02:13:50,323
Shut up!

1596
02:13:50,999 --> 02:13:52,796
l had won long ago.

1597
02:13:54,035 --> 02:13:57,300
l had killed your Mr. Thakur
his young son..

1598
02:13:57,405 --> 02:14:00,772
..and his daughterinlaw
with one blow.

1599
02:14:01,843 --> 02:14:04,471
Only you and your owner's
grandson survived.

1600
02:14:04,779 --> 02:14:08,044
You raised him with
love for 25 years.

1601
02:14:08,249 --> 02:14:09,807
l'll get you killed by him.

1602
02:14:12,086 --> 02:14:15,385
The Zoravar who didn't spare
his parents and grandpa..

1603
02:14:15,823 --> 02:14:17,154
