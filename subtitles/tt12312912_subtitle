00:00:36,983 --> 00:00:39,983
Hey Sister! You forgot your
phone!

2
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,025
Hey Sister!

3
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:48,983
Bastard!

4
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:52,567
Sir, you won't find
a cheaper hotel than ours.

5
00:00:52,608 --> 00:00:54,608
{\an8}Top class view.

6
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:59,567
{\an8}If you don't like it, I'll drive
you to wherever you wish to go.

7
00:00:59,858 --> 00:01:01,358
But what's the rate?

8
00:01:01,567 --> 00:01:04,775
I'm giving you the best rate, Sir.
Only 1500 rupees.

9
00:01:04,817 --> 00:01:07,650
Room service, hot water,
satellite TV all included.

10
00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:08,942
Come, sir.

11
00:01:15,025 --> 00:01:16,817
Their hotel has Indian
style toilets, Ma'am.

12
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:20,525
Ma'am, when in India,
use Indian toilets!

13
00:01:20,567 --> 00:01:22,067
It clears the tummy in a jiffy.

14
00:01:22,108 --> 00:01:25,983
Exercises your legs and
cures constipation. ALL IN ONE!

15
00:01:26,025 --> 00:01:30,983
Indian toilets are like Yoga, Sir!
And it costs nothing!

16
00:01:31,025 --> 00:01:32,983
Come Sir!
- How much?

17
00:01:33,025 --> 00:01:35,858
1000 rupees ma'am, we'll
serve you delicious local food.

18
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:38,567
Ma'am they don't
even have a road there.

19
00:01:38,608 --> 00:01:40,525
The climb will wear your legs
out!

20
00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:42,025
The climb's not that bad, ma'am.

21
00:01:42,067 --> 00:01:44,067
You won't find such
a view anywhere else.

22
00:01:44,817 --> 00:01:46,650
Sir, 1200.

23
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,858
Let's close it at 800.

24
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,858
Okay ma'am, 800 is fine by us.

25
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:53,900
Their hotel is next to the road.
You'll hear noisy traffic all night.

26
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,733
Sir, let's settle at 1000.

27
00:01:56,983 --> 00:01:58,108
500, ma'am.

28
00:01:58,358 --> 00:02:00,108
We'll pay you 800,
take it or leave it.

29
00:02:00,358 --> 00:02:03,692
Be reasonable, ma'am.
800 is unfeasible.

30
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:07,775
Let's do this. Let's finalize
it at 1000, no extra taxes!

31
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:11,025
How far is it?
- Not too far, ma'am.

32
00:02:12,983 --> 00:02:16,692
What's this, sister?
What will you even earn from 500?

33
00:02:16,733 --> 00:02:18,067
Carry on, then.

34
00:02:38,108 --> 00:02:39,525
Swati...

35
00:02:41,942 --> 00:02:43,358
Let's take a selfie here.

36
00:02:51,775 --> 00:02:55,025
<i>...India will be space

<i>While congratulating the
scientists Prime Minister said...</i>

38
00:02:58,317 --> 00:03:01,483
<i>Now India will be counted
among world's superpowers.</i>

39
00:03:05,608 --> 00:03:08,067
Where are you coming from?
- Bus stand.

40
00:03:39,025 --> 00:03:40,692
I'll get you some water.

41
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,067
Who brought these chickens?

42
00:04:52,608 --> 00:04:53,983
Your father brought them.

43
00:04:54,025 --> 00:04:55,650
Where is he?

44
00:04:56,067 --> 00:04:58,067
Didi, I'm asking you... where
is he?

45
00:04:59,358 --> 00:05:01,067
He's in the greenhouse.

47
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,067
Where are my pants?

48
00:05:45,108 --> 00:05:46,400
Why would I hide them?

49
00:05:46,442 --> 00:05:47,692
Put on the towel.

50
00:05:47,942 --> 00:05:49,108
You look like a cartoon
character.

51
00:06:23,108 --> 00:06:24,358
What the fuck is this?!!

52
00:06:26,775 --> 00:06:28,317
Do you think I'm a joke?!!

53
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:33,817
Did I get hens for you to cook
them?

54
00:06:33,858 --> 00:06:36,358
Is it a crime to earn two
pennies?

55
00:06:37,108 --> 00:06:38,400
Two pennies?

56
00:06:38,442 --> 00:06:40,442
Like when you started
the greenhouse?

57
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:41,858
It was you who cursed that!

58
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,567
"Who'll buy broccoli
and zucchini?" you said.

59
00:06:45,025 --> 00:06:49,025
Even when I opened that
tea-shop, you kept nagging me!

60
00:06:52,983 --> 00:06:54,067
I'm fucking fed up.

61
00:07:01,483 --> 00:07:03,858
Sir, we have chicken curry
on the menu tonight.

62
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,900
I know. We ordered it.

63
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,108
It's tasty.

64
00:08:06,942 --> 00:08:08,692
But don't slaughter any more!

65
00:08:15,858 --> 00:08:18,358
That land!
Let's sell the greenhouse land.

66
00:08:19,942 --> 00:08:21,692
We can start the
road with the money.

67
00:08:21,733 --> 00:08:24,900
How can you say that, Chandra?
It's our ancestral land.

68
00:08:26,607 --> 00:08:28,067
We'll be cursed!

69
00:08:28,567 --> 00:08:29,942
Who will buy it?

70
00:08:30,357 --> 00:08:32,857
It won't fetch anything.

71
00:08:33,982 --> 00:08:36,025
I have saved some money.

72
00:08:36,442 --> 00:08:38,067
It will all add up.

73
00:08:41,108 --> 00:08:42,608
How much money do you have?

74
00:08:48,858 --> 00:08:50,317
Tell me!

75
00:09:03,983 --> 00:09:05,608
I slog all day.

76
00:09:05,983 --> 00:09:07,650
We've barely got
enough for the doctor.

77
00:09:07,692 --> 00:09:09,317
What will the doctor do?

78
00:09:09,358 --> 00:09:11,692
Only our deity can help now.

79
00:09:12,483 --> 00:09:14,775
You, your deity and your sister!

80
00:09:15,608 --> 00:09:17,067
What does my sister
have to do with this?!

81
00:09:17,483 --> 00:09:20,067
You are up-in-arms as
soon as I mention your sister.

82
00:09:20,108 --> 00:09:22,483
Don't you see me
working like a mule?

83
00:10:03,775 --> 00:10:05,567
Should I give you
body pressing massage?

84
00:10:07,567 --> 00:10:09,400
Haven't you pressed me enough?

85
00:10:21,525 --> 00:10:25,858
<i>I like big butts
and I cannot lie.</i>

86
00:10:31,067 --> 00:10:36,900
<i>I like big butts
and I cannot lie.</i>

87
00:11:00,525 --> 00:11:01,942
I couldn't find the other torch.

88
00:11:04,525 --> 00:11:05,858
How did you learn this?

89
00:11:06,358 --> 00:11:07,942
Use those brains on
your studies too, yeah?

90
00:11:22,067 --> 00:11:23,692
Let's go.

91
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:49,942
<i>The moment for which the whole
country was waiting for 500 years...</i>

92
00:11:49,983 --> 00:11:51,317
<i>...that moment has arrived.</i>

93
00:11:51,358 --> 00:11:54,483
{\an8}<i>Prime Minister is visiting Ayodhya
for the inaugural ceremony of Ram Temple.</i>

94
00:11:54,525 --> 00:11:56,817
<i>The way Ayodhya welcomed god
Ram.</i>

95
00:11:57,317 --> 00:11:58,483
What are you doing Prakash?

96
00:11:58,817 --> 00:12:02,025
<i>Just like that, Ayodhya is eager
to welcome the Prime Minister today.</i>

97
00:12:59,733 --> 00:13:01,358
Look, just start okay?

98
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:03,025
Don't make a fuss.

99
00:13:03,567 --> 00:13:04,775
Okay?

100
00:13:05,067 --> 00:13:06,108
Please...

101
00:13:12,025 --> 00:13:14,025
Yes. That's right.

102
00:13:14,442 --> 00:13:18,900
Now don't throw a tantrum
on the way or she'll get mad.

103
00:13:19,483 --> 00:13:20,983
Protect my dignity!

104
00:14:28,483 --> 00:14:29,650
Keep it here.

105
00:14:29,692 --> 00:14:31,025
Don't move it. Okay?

106
00:14:37,525 --> 00:14:38,942
Is the BMD okay?

107
00:14:40,567 --> 00:14:41,817
Okay, sir.

108
00:14:42,067 --> 00:14:43,567
Lift your leg, son.

109
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:45,067
Lift it.

110
00:14:45,983 --> 00:14:47,483
Lift it, son!

111
00:14:48,108 --> 00:14:49,608
Can't lift it?

112
00:14:50,942 --> 00:14:53,608
It's been 5 months and you
still can't move your leg!

113
00:14:54,608 --> 00:14:55,733
Let's see.

114
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,067
Does it hurt?
- It tickles.

115
00:14:59,108 --> 00:15:00,900
It tickles? Wow...

116
00:15:01,608 --> 00:15:02,983
Which grade are you in?

117
00:15:03,025 --> 00:15:03,817
6th.

118
00:15:03,858 --> 00:15:07,108
Okay! Grade 6, well done.

119
00:15:10,858 --> 00:15:12,942
Okay, so grade 6.

120
00:15:13,858 --> 00:15:15,025
Tell me something.

121
00:15:15,858 --> 00:15:17,108
Do you like Math?

122
00:15:19,442 --> 00:15:21,775
English? Do you like English?

123
00:15:23,067 --> 00:15:24,400
No?

124
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,442
Are you scared of your teacher?

125
00:15:27,483 --> 00:15:28,692
No?

126
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:33,775
Okay, then. Let's try to stand
up.

127
00:15:34,317 --> 00:15:36,650
Okay? Come on! Very good, try!

128
00:15:36,983 --> 00:15:38,858
Let's try it once.

129
00:15:39,817 --> 00:15:42,358
Stand up. Stand!

130
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,733
STAND UP!

131
00:15:45,483 --> 00:15:46,692
Stand!

132
00:15:47,025 --> 00:15:48,067
STAND UP!

133
00:15:50,483 --> 00:15:51,900
You won't get up?
Give me the machine.

134
00:15:52,108 --> 00:15:53,567
Let's chop off your legs!

135
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:54,817
Okay?

136
00:15:54,858 --> 00:15:56,025
Should I cut them off?

137
00:15:56,067 --> 00:15:57,067
Should I?!

138
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:00,358
Yeah?

139
00:16:01,358 --> 00:16:02,567
Should I cut them off?

140
00:16:22,942 --> 00:16:24,025
Doctor Sahib?

141
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:27,358
If the reports are fine
then why is he not walking?

142
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:30,983
There is no defect in his legs.
It's a mental block.

143
00:16:31,025 --> 00:16:33,525
Counselling will be able
to diagnose the problem.

144
00:16:33,858 --> 00:16:35,900
You'll have to bring
him three times a week.

145
00:16:36,108 --> 00:16:37,608
For 2 more months.

146
00:16:37,942 --> 00:16:38,983
Okay?

147
00:16:56,858 --> 00:16:58,066
I lost count.

148
00:16:59,983 --> 00:17:01,775
Doctor Sahib,
I know what the problem is.

149
00:17:01,816 --> 00:17:02,900
What?

150
00:17:04,441 --> 00:17:06,441
Our family-deity is upset.

151
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:07,775
Deity?

152
00:17:09,483 --> 00:17:10,983
Don't you see it?

153
00:17:12,441 --> 00:17:14,316
He prescribes a new test every
time.

154
00:17:14,691 --> 00:17:16,108
You're talking nonsense.

155
00:17:16,316 --> 00:17:17,816
Doctor, please make him
understand.

156
00:17:17,858 --> 00:17:20,858
If the village had a road
I would've brought Prakash every day.

157
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,900
He would've been running by now!

158
00:17:22,942 --> 00:17:25,108
My husband is obsessed
with doing the Jagar ceremony.

159
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,400
My sister's widowed.

160
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:43,025
Our son can't walk.

161
00:17:43,067 --> 00:17:44,942
And you just want
to blow all our money!

162
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,358
Here.

163
00:17:49,733 --> 00:17:50,900
Dharam!

164
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,358
We're just friends.

165
00:18:18,817 --> 00:18:20,025
You understand that, right?

166
00:18:20,983 --> 00:18:22,900
There's nothing more between us.

167
00:18:25,983 --> 00:18:27,067
Run!

168
00:18:33,525 --> 00:18:34,775
Where's Papa?

169
00:18:37,025 --> 00:18:38,650
What did the doctor say?

170
00:18:40,733 --> 00:18:43,775
I came first again
and won this in a bet.

171
00:18:43,817 --> 00:18:46,650
If there's anything
between you and that boy...

172
00:18:46,692 --> 00:18:48,067
I've been topping the
class for four years now.

173
00:18:48,317 --> 00:18:50,942
You don't see that!
All you see is chocolate!

174
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:54,900
So what? Should I shout
this from the rooftops?

175
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:59,650
Why can't you teach Prakash
instead of mucking around with boys?

176
00:19:00,067 --> 00:19:02,025
Can he go to school in his
state?

177
00:19:03,317 --> 00:19:05,900
As if he was winning
laurels when he could walk!

178
00:19:19,025 --> 00:19:21,650
Prakash, if you aren't watching (TV),
then switch it off.

179
00:19:25,858 --> 00:19:27,650
{\an8}I'm talking to you Prakash.

180
00:19:30,108 --> 00:19:31,900
Damn it! Are you deaf now?

181
00:19:32,358 --> 00:19:33,650
Give me the remote, Prakash!

182
00:19:33,692 --> 00:19:34,983
Give it to me!

183
00:19:36,525 --> 00:19:38,442
I will show your
Tuk Tuk video to mom.

184
00:19:41,483 --> 00:19:42,983
At least put a 't' in
Switzerland!

185
00:20:58,483 --> 00:20:59,900
Sister...

186
00:20:59,942 --> 00:21:01,442
Let me pay you.

187
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,108
<i>India is growing at fast speed.</i>

188
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:18,358
<i>Every village has a road.</i>

189
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,900
<i>Every house has
electricity and a toilet.</i>

190
00:21:21,525 --> 00:21:25,442
<i>Soon, India will be among
the developed countries.</i>

191
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,983
<i>What previous governments
didn't achieve in 70 years...</i>

192
00:21:29,025 --> 00:21:31,067
<i>Will be done in 10 years.</i>

193
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:37,067
<i>After winning the elections
with big margin...</i>

194
00:21:37,317 --> 00:21:39,942
<i>... Amit Mehta has been
selected as</i>

195
00:21:39,983 --> 00:21:41,983
<i>road and transportation minister
of the state.</i>

196
00:21:42,733 --> 00:21:45,608
<i>Day after, he is visiting
his constituency...</i>

197
00:21:46,942 --> 00:21:49,983
<i>... Munsiyari is called
Switzerland of Uttarakhand.</i>

198
00:21:50,692 --> 00:21:52,775
<i>Looks stunning during
this time of the year.</i>

199
00:21:53,067 --> 00:21:56,067
<i>One can see the Himalayas
almost every day.</i>

200
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:59,317
<i>Amit Mehta will spend
two days in Munsiyari.</i>

201
00:21:59,817 --> 00:22:01,942
<i>Then he will be visiting
Pithoragarh.</i>

202
00:22:02,442 --> 00:22:04,858
<i>Where a grand reception
is waiting for him.</i>

203
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:07,483
<i>Now, let's move towards
international news.</i>

204
00:22:07,942 --> 00:22:09,608
<i>Russian President Putin said...</i>

205
00:22:24,567 --> 00:22:26,067
- Hi sissy!
- Mummy!

206
00:22:26,983 --> 00:22:27,900
Dork!

207
00:22:27,942 --> 00:22:31,067
Mummy! Oh Mummy! Where are you?

208
00:22:32,942 --> 00:22:34,025
Do you remember?

209
00:22:34,858 --> 00:22:36,358
Do you remember?

210
00:22:37,483 --> 00:22:39,817
Cripple... Where is your Mummy?

211
00:22:45,817 --> 00:22:47,067
Who were they?

212
00:22:51,733 --> 00:22:52,775
I've been saying it for so
long...

213
00:22:52,817 --> 00:22:54,900
25000 each and we could
finally get this road built.

214
00:22:55,525 --> 00:22:58,983
If I had that kind of money,
I'd remarry!

215
00:23:00,942 --> 00:23:02,650
Why don't you tell
the Village Chief?

216
00:23:02,692 --> 00:23:05,400
The board announcing the
road has been there for 4 years now.

217
00:23:05,442 --> 00:23:06,900
You think he cares?

218
00:23:06,942 --> 00:23:08,733
That cripple's hotel
is on the road.

219
00:23:08,983 --> 00:23:10,775
He charges 1500 a day.

220
00:23:10,817 --> 00:23:14,942
If we built the road together,
we could also raise our rentals.

221
00:23:15,525 --> 00:23:17,608
We don't even earn 800
currently.

222
00:23:17,858 --> 00:23:19,900
Okay enough chit-chat now.

223
00:23:20,567 --> 00:23:23,483
Let's head home.

224
00:23:50,025 --> 00:23:51,067
Shit.

225
00:23:52,025 --> 00:23:53,358
Guru, help me.

226
00:24:06,775 --> 00:24:09,858
Had your grandmother
not told you to do Jagar?

227
00:24:10,317 --> 00:24:12,525
No, Guru. She never said
anything.

228
00:24:12,942 --> 00:24:14,733
I can see that she told you.

229
00:24:14,775 --> 00:24:15,858
Really?

230
00:24:17,025 --> 00:24:18,817
Okay, then I will
make some arrangements.

231
00:24:18,858 --> 00:24:19,733
Arrangements?

232
00:24:20,025 --> 00:24:21,358
Okay.

233
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:28,400
I'll make you some sacred ash.

234
00:24:28,608 --> 00:24:29,900
Okay.

235
00:24:41,567 --> 00:24:42,942
Do you drink?

236
00:24:44,567 --> 00:24:46,483
No Guru.
- Sure?

237
00:24:46,692 --> 00:24:47,567
I don't drink.

238
00:24:48,108 --> 00:24:50,650
- I am giving you sacred ash.
- Okay.

239
00:24:50,942 --> 00:24:55,025
After the prayer, put some
on your boy and some on you.

240
00:24:55,067 --> 00:24:56,025
- Okay.
- Understood?

241
00:24:56,067 --> 00:24:56,900
Yes.

242
00:24:56,942 --> 00:24:58,567
The sacred ash will take care
of all your problems

243
00:24:58,608 --> 00:25:00,900
until you do the Jagar.

244
00:25:00,942 --> 00:25:02,650
- Okay.
- Good.

245
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:07,108
- Pray to your clan deity.
- I am poor man, don't have much.

246
00:25:07,983 --> 00:25:09,733
Put it there.

247
00:25:09,775 --> 00:25:11,525
- I will take your leave Guru.
- Sure.

248
00:25:11,567 --> 00:25:12,942
- Thank you.
- Live long.

249
00:27:38,358 --> 00:27:39,900
Hey!

250
00:27:39,942 --> 00:27:41,733
Leave him!

251
00:27:53,567 --> 00:27:54,942
Who left the door unlatched?

252
00:27:55,692 --> 00:27:57,275
The dog got out.

253
00:28:27,067 --> 00:28:28,983
Are you addicted to sweets now
too?

254
00:28:33,733 --> 00:28:34,983
What are you doing?

255
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,650
Are you crazy?

256
00:28:40,317 --> 00:28:41,525
Obviously someone ate them.

257
00:28:41,817 --> 00:28:42,775
Chandra!

258
00:28:45,525 --> 00:28:46,983
It could've been you!

259
00:28:47,025 --> 00:28:49,025
Why would I steal from my own
house?

260
00:28:51,650 --> 00:28:53,733
I forgot that this isn't my
house!

261
00:29:26,525 --> 00:29:28,525
My doggie died last week as
well.

262
00:29:32,067 --> 00:29:34,317
Sugar-free came under a car.

263
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:37,692
Sugar-free?

264
00:29:40,025 --> 00:29:41,692
His name was Sugar-free.

265
00:29:42,067 --> 00:29:43,067
Strange name.

266
00:29:45,442 --> 00:29:46,942
My grandfather named him.

267
00:29:47,983 --> 00:29:49,983
He is a huge fan
of Amitabh Bachchan.

268
00:29:50,567 --> 00:29:52,942
Named the dog after his film.

269
00:30:03,025 --> 00:30:04,067
How did this happen?

270
00:30:15,317 --> 00:30:20,317
{\an8}<i>I'll think about meeting you.</i>

271
00:30:20,358 --> 00:30:22,817
{\an8}<i>If you confess your
feelings...</i>

272
00:30:22,858 --> 00:30:24,858
{\an8}What does Kanchan do all day?

273
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:28,400
She's quite odd.

274
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:30,942
She knows nothing apart
from Tuk Tuk videos.

275
00:30:31,567 --> 00:30:32,983
She's weird.

276
00:30:35,442 --> 00:30:37,442
Neeraj, where's your Dad?

277
00:30:39,358 --> 00:30:41,567
Papa! Someone's here to see you.

278
00:30:41,608 --> 00:30:43,775
<i>"Aha, fuck me harder."</i>

279
00:30:43,817 --> 00:30:45,525
- Papa!
- Who is it?

280
00:30:45,567 --> 00:30:46,900
Kanchan's mother.

281
00:30:46,942 --> 00:30:48,025
Send her up.

282
00:30:54,775 --> 00:30:55,775
Hi!

283
00:30:58,483 --> 00:30:59,567
Be careful.

284
00:31:10,983 --> 00:31:12,483
What brings you here?

285
00:31:12,525 --> 00:31:14,942
I heard on the radio
that the minister is coming.

286
00:31:14,983 --> 00:31:16,775
Please get work started on the
road.

287
00:31:16,817 --> 00:31:19,483
The work will begin soon.
Have a seat.

288
00:31:20,983 --> 00:31:22,775
Come on. Sit with me.

289
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,067
Did you hurt your leg?

290
00:31:38,983 --> 00:31:40,858
You should have
pulled up your saree.

291
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:44,025
Show me... show.

292
00:31:51,525 --> 00:31:53,025
You know our minister ji ...

293
00:31:53,067 --> 00:31:55,317
He always listens to me.

294
00:31:56,983 --> 00:32:01,025
I got the cable TV
contract thanks to him!

295
00:32:01,733 --> 00:32:03,317
Understood?

296
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:06,317
So why don't you ask him
to get the road built?

297
00:32:06,358 --> 00:32:07,358
Let me see.

298
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,525
I was a doctor's
assistant for five years.

299
00:32:12,692 --> 00:32:14,025
It's turning red.

300
00:32:16,525 --> 00:32:18,317
It's not a fracture, right?

301
00:32:23,525 --> 00:32:24,858
It's government work.

302
00:32:26,983 --> 00:32:29,025
It requires special attention.

303
00:32:29,525 --> 00:32:32,733
Everything comes at a price...
Even cow-dung!

304
00:33:33,025 --> 00:33:34,317
Here.

305
00:34:14,317 --> 00:34:16,942
{\an8}<i>Love is not a game.</i>

306
00:34:17,317 --> 00:34:19,983
{\an8}<i>Don't make a farce of it.</i>

307
00:34:20,692 --> 00:34:26,025
{\an8}<i>That is why I hide my tears.</i>

308
00:34:26,067 --> 00:34:28,942
{\an8}<i>You have no idea.</i>

309
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:15,400
Cheers!
- Cheers!

310
00:35:35,858 --> 00:35:38,442
Sir! Put on a dance number?

311
00:35:38,483 --> 00:35:41,900
Which one?

312
00:35:41,942 --> 00:35:44,733
Something racy! Shall we?

313
00:38:00,733 --> 00:38:01,900
What happened Dharam?

314
00:38:13,525 --> 00:38:15,442
No... No...

315
00:38:18,817 --> 00:38:20,817
Forgive me! Grandma!

316
00:38:20,858 --> 00:38:22,733
I'm sorry, I've made a mistake!

317
00:38:23,067 --> 00:38:24,942
I've made a mistake! Forgive
me...

318
00:38:25,858 --> 00:38:27,025
What happened?

319
00:38:27,067 --> 00:38:28,942
Have water. Drink up.

320
00:38:33,608 --> 00:38:36,025
What happened?
Who are you talking to?

321
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:41,942
Didi!
We've made a terrible mistake!

322
00:38:43,067 --> 00:38:44,942
Grandma was here... she was
here!

323
00:38:44,983 --> 00:38:47,942
You were jumping around
choking yourself...

324
00:38:47,983 --> 00:38:50,483
'Grandma!'...
How much did you drink?

325
00:38:52,692 --> 00:38:53,983
Prakash!

326
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:06,358
Kanchan!

327
00:40:06,817 --> 00:40:07,900
Sister.

328
00:40:10,358 --> 00:40:12,025
Give it to him.

329
00:40:42,692 --> 00:40:44,608
I will do Jagar when I have
money.

330
00:40:44,817 --> 00:40:46,900
For time being,
please accept this gift.

331
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,567
Hail Goddess!

332
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:50,525
Hail Goddess!

333
00:40:50,733 --> 00:40:52,608
Hail Goddess!

334
00:41:06,775 --> 00:41:07,858
Panditji...

335
00:41:08,067 --> 00:41:09,858
Mark her forehead.

336
00:41:36,692 --> 00:41:37,858
Chandra!

337
00:42:06,775 --> 00:42:09,817
<i>Pankaj Nautial will read
the news for you.</i>

338
00:42:09,858 --> 00:42:11,900
<i>News in detail.</i>

339
00:42:11,942 --> 00:42:14,692
<i>Prime Minister reached
Manali last night.</i>

340
00:42:14,733 --> 00:42:17,858
<i>According to reliable sources
he has left for Rohtang.</i>

341
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:19,608
<i>He will reach here soon.</i>

342
00:42:19,650 --> 00:42:23,525
<i>This tunnel is an example of
excellence in engineering in India.</i>

343
00:42:23,567 --> 00:42:25,358
<i>It's a historical moment.</i>

344
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:28,692
<i>Today, the Prime Minister will gift
this tunnel to the nation.</i>

345
00:42:28,733 --> 00:42:30,483
<i>Prime Minister has reached here.</i>

346
00:43:58,275 --> 00:43:59,692
<i>Let me see.</i>

347
00:44:07,025 --> 00:44:08,650
<i>Let me see.</i>

348
00:44:32,275 --> 00:44:33,483
What happened?

349
00:44:36,358 --> 00:44:37,900
Is your stomach upset?

350
00:44:42,858 --> 00:44:43,942
Don't worry!

351
00:44:44,733 --> 00:44:46,692
The road work will start
on Saturday.

352
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:48,525
I'm getting it done.

353
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:51,358
Then you can go to
hospital comfortably!

354
00:46:49,483 --> 00:46:50,650
Kanchan.

355
00:46:51,567 --> 00:46:52,817
It's late, go to bed.

356
00:46:53,483 --> 00:46:55,650
- Two more pages.
- No, go now.

357
00:47:00,567 --> 00:47:02,400
I'll finish these two pages and
go.

358
00:47:07,650 --> 00:47:09,317
You are drunk again.

359
00:47:11,650 --> 00:47:14,483
You are so lovable
when you're sober.

360
00:47:25,483 --> 00:47:26,608
So?

361
00:47:26,858 --> 00:47:29,400
Do you study at home
or just watch TV?

362
00:47:35,817 --> 00:47:36,983
Here.

363
00:47:40,608 --> 00:47:41,942
Speak up.

364
00:47:45,733 --> 00:47:47,650
Kanchan taught you, didn't she?

365
00:47:50,025 --> 00:47:52,983
What are you staring at?
Look up and answer the question.

366
00:47:58,567 --> 00:48:00,775
Look, he is weak in all
subjects.

367
00:48:00,817 --> 00:48:02,650
He doesn't know English.

368
00:48:02,692 --> 00:48:05,317
You can't bring him to school.
He doesn't send in his homework.

369
00:48:05,817 --> 00:48:07,733
Please give us some time.

370
00:48:07,775 --> 00:48:09,483
How much time do you want?

371
00:48:10,358 --> 00:48:11,942
It's already been 5 months.

372
00:48:14,483 --> 00:48:15,567
One month.

373
00:48:15,608 --> 00:48:16,983
The road will also be ready by
then.

374
00:48:19,317 --> 00:48:20,442
Three days.

375
00:48:25,608 --> 00:48:28,358
Okay. I'll bring him to
school from Saturday.

376
00:48:40,858 --> 00:48:43,608
How do you know that the
road will be built in a month?

377
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:46,650
I told you,
the government is getting it done.

378
00:48:46,692 --> 00:48:49,025
It hasn't been built in four years,
now it'll be done in a month?

379
00:48:49,442 --> 00:48:50,775
Have you gone crazy?

380
00:48:51,858 --> 00:48:53,275
Where did you hear it from?

381
00:48:53,525 --> 00:48:55,400
I heard it from
women in the village.

382
00:48:58,025 --> 00:48:59,567
Which women?

383
00:49:21,983 --> 00:49:23,275
Prakash?

384
00:49:24,567 --> 00:49:25,608
Prakash?!

385
00:49:27,067 --> 00:49:28,733
Is there something
you want to tell me?

386
00:49:41,733 --> 00:49:43,858
Yay, Papa... our team won!

387
00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:46,900
{\an8}We have to go to Delhi next week,
for the national quiz competition!

388
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:49,483
Bless you, my dear!

389
00:49:55,650 --> 00:49:57,358
Come, sit. Have some chowmein.

390
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:59,567
Not chowmein, hakka noodles!

391
00:49:59,608 --> 00:50:02,733
Brother, one plate hakka
noodles.

392
00:50:03,733 --> 00:50:05,067
Look, Ma.

393
00:50:10,025 --> 00:50:11,900
You're not going to Delhi.

394
00:50:12,775 --> 00:50:15,275
You look after the house.
I'll take Prakash to school.

395
00:50:15,608 --> 00:50:16,858
Your father has no time to take
him.

396
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:18,942
When did I say I don't have
time?

397
00:50:20,775 --> 00:50:22,567
We have to do the Jagar.

398
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:25,358
Where will we get
the money for that?

399
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:28,025
- Please, Ma!
- Enough of fun and games for you!

400
00:50:42,025 --> 00:50:43,942
It's a New Year card, Papa.

401
00:50:45,983 --> 00:50:47,775
You've gone mad.

402
00:50:48,775 --> 00:50:51,317
You want her to be
uneducated like my sister?

403
00:50:55,317 --> 00:50:56,400
Done?

404
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:58,817
Happy now?

405
00:51:01,983 --> 00:51:03,483
Let's go.

406
00:51:04,942 --> 00:51:06,483
Let's go.

407
00:51:38,525 --> 00:51:40,025
Come on!

408
00:51:48,608 --> 00:51:49,775
Chandra!

409
00:51:50,525 --> 00:51:53,025
Will you go to the market today?

410
00:51:57,025 --> 00:51:58,775
I've run out of my medicines.

411
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:01,983
Ask your ancestors to get them.

412
00:52:06,650 --> 00:52:07,942
- Move.
- Give that to me.

413
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:09,983
- Leave it.
- Leave.

414
00:52:10,025 --> 00:52:11,775
Move. Let go.

415
00:52:11,817 --> 00:52:13,567
Leave it! Why are you
interfering?

416
00:52:13,608 --> 00:52:16,067
Why shouldn't I?
Isn't this my brother's house?

417
00:52:16,275 --> 00:52:17,567
- Leave it.
- You leave it!

418
00:52:18,067 --> 00:52:19,567
Leave!

419
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:21,942
Leave!

420
00:52:22,567 --> 00:52:23,692
Guru...

421
00:52:24,067 --> 00:52:25,733
I have sacrificed a goat

422
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:28,067
but my troubles
are still increasing.

423
00:52:28,442 --> 00:52:30,900
I can do the Jagar in 6 months.

424
00:52:31,900 --> 00:52:34,025
What more can I do for the
house?

425
00:52:38,858 --> 00:52:39,942
Glory to God!

426
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:50,775
You are talking about the house?

427
00:52:51,733 --> 00:52:53,650
Your wife doesn't want the
Jagar!

428
00:52:53,942 --> 00:52:55,692
Do you need her permission?

429
00:52:57,525 --> 00:52:59,942
Who's the boss of this house,
you or your wife?

430
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:01,442
Eh!

431
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:02,858
I am, Sir.

432
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:05,358
Then rein her in!
How dare she defy you!

433
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:07,525
How dare she obstruct the ritual?
Tell me!

434
00:53:08,858 --> 00:53:10,942
You walk north, she goes south!

435
00:53:12,650 --> 00:53:13,858
Leave... Go.

436
00:53:20,567 --> 00:53:23,025
Papa, no... Papa...

437
00:53:23,650 --> 00:53:25,442
<i>I'll clobber you with this...
Don't try my patience!</i>

438
00:53:25,483 --> 00:53:26,817
Papa open the door.

439
00:53:26,858 --> 00:53:27,983
Kanchan!

440
00:53:30,983 --> 00:53:32,317
Hit me, if you're a man!

441
00:53:32,983 --> 00:53:34,525
Tell me where the money is.

442
00:53:34,817 --> 00:53:36,067
I won't give you a penny!

443
00:53:37,067 --> 00:53:39,858
I'll fuck you up...
Where's the money!

444
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:41,817
Hit me, if you ain't
the son of a whore!

445
00:53:42,317 --> 00:53:44,358
Papa...

446
00:53:56,817 --> 00:53:57,775
Leave me.

447
00:53:57,817 --> 00:53:58,900
- Go to hell...
- Leave me!

448
00:53:58,942 --> 00:54:00,942
- Both you and your sister!
- Leave me.

449
00:54:00,983 --> 00:54:02,067
You want money?

450
00:54:02,317 --> 00:54:03,733
Want to do your Jagar?

451
00:54:04,067 --> 00:54:05,400
You'll dance too?

452
00:54:05,442 --> 00:54:07,025
I'd rather die than
give you a penny.

453
00:54:07,067 --> 00:54:08,400
Leave me!

454
00:55:56,858 --> 00:55:59,775
Leopard on the loose!

455
00:55:59,942 --> 00:56:03,567
Leopard on the loose!

456
00:56:03,983 --> 00:56:05,858
Leopard on the loose!

457
00:56:09,025 --> 00:56:09,983
Chandra!

458
00:56:11,483 --> 00:56:12,900
Papa, where's Aunty?

459
00:56:13,358 --> 00:56:14,650
Leopard on the loose!

460
00:56:14,692 --> 00:56:15,983
Check the bathroom.

461
00:56:16,025 --> 00:56:17,942
Leopard on the loose!

462
00:56:19,442 --> 00:56:21,942
Leopard on the loose!

463
00:56:27,025 --> 00:56:29,775
Didi! Didi!

464
00:56:30,567 --> 00:56:33,317
Didi! Didi!

465
00:56:35,942 --> 00:56:37,275
She's not here.

466
00:56:37,650 --> 00:56:38,817
Didi!
- Kamla!

467
00:56:39,025 --> 00:56:41,900
Didi!
- Aunty! Kamla!

468
00:56:42,317 --> 00:56:42,942
You sleep!

469
00:56:42,983 --> 00:56:44,900
Didi!
- Kamla!

470
00:56:57,858 --> 00:56:59,025
Okay Sir.

471
00:56:59,483 --> 00:57:00,442
Yes.

472
00:57:00,733 --> 00:57:02,442
That's right.

473
00:57:02,942 --> 00:57:04,025
Okay Sir.

474
00:57:05,442 --> 00:57:06,358
Brother...

475
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:09,358
The forest department says
there is no man-eating leopard here.

476
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:11,942
Not in the entire Kumaon region.

477
00:57:13,817 --> 00:57:14,983
What now?

478
00:57:15,025 --> 00:57:16,317
Now, as in?

479
00:57:16,733 --> 00:57:18,317
How can we find her?

480
00:57:19,567 --> 00:57:20,817
Brother...

481
00:57:20,858 --> 00:57:23,692
People are saying you
guys didn't get along.

482
00:57:23,733 --> 00:57:26,608
Every family has issues.
Your fights can be heard in our house!

483
00:57:26,650 --> 00:57:27,650
Chandra!

484
00:57:29,442 --> 00:57:32,608
Sister... she was a widow.

485
00:57:32,900 --> 00:57:34,025
And...

486
00:57:34,525 --> 00:57:35,942
...you didn't get along with
her.

487
00:57:36,692 --> 00:57:39,358
You must have said something...
That's why she left.

488
00:57:40,358 --> 00:57:41,858
Am I not right, brother?

489
00:57:43,733 --> 00:57:44,900
Now, go home.

490
00:57:45,483 --> 00:57:47,983
As soon as we get an update,
I'll inform you.

491
00:58:23,317 --> 00:58:24,608
What's the matter?

492
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:28,317
Want a slap?

493
00:58:41,525 --> 00:58:43,400
- Sir, have you seen her anywhere?
- No.

494
00:58:43,442 --> 00:58:44,650
Please see.

495
00:58:44,692 --> 00:58:46,025
- Haven't seen her.
- You haven't?

496
00:58:48,483 --> 00:58:49,817
Sir, have you seen this lady?

497
00:58:51,983 --> 00:58:53,608
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye son.

498
00:58:53,650 --> 00:58:56,608
Okay, sister. Thank you so much.
We had a really nice trip.

499
00:58:56,650 --> 00:58:57,775
Okay...

500
00:58:57,817 --> 00:58:58,817
Goodbye, Sir.

501
00:58:58,858 --> 00:59:02,025
No Aunty... We've been
to the police station already.

502
00:59:02,067 --> 00:59:03,692
I'm at the taxi stand now.

503
00:59:03,900 --> 00:59:04,983
We haven't found out anything.

504
00:59:08,567 --> 00:59:09,942
Aunty, I'll speak to you later.

505
00:59:11,483 --> 00:59:12,692
Sisterfucker!

506
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:25,483
Move.

507
00:59:26,942 --> 00:59:29,942
- Where's the money!
- Search... Why should I tell you?

508
00:59:29,983 --> 00:59:30,817
TELL ME NOW!

509
00:59:31,067 --> 00:59:32,400
- WHY SHOULD I?
- I WANT THE MONEY!

510
00:59:32,442 --> 00:59:33,858
- THEN LOOK FOR IT!
- SHUT UP!

511
00:59:33,983 --> 00:59:34,983
- Shut up.
- Shameless cunt!

512
00:59:35,108 --> 00:59:36,275
- Shut up.
- Bugger off.

513
00:59:37,983 --> 00:59:39,692
Fucking bitch!

514
00:59:42,942 --> 00:59:45,733
- What will you do?
- I'll burn this place down.

515
00:59:45,775 --> 00:59:46,900
- Go ahead!
- Do you understand?

516
00:59:46,942 --> 00:59:48,608
Burn it.

517
00:59:48,650 --> 00:59:50,983
- This is MY house!
- Yes, it's yours.

518
00:59:51,025 --> 00:59:51,983
Then take some responsibility!

519
00:59:52,025 --> 00:59:55,025
I am taking it...
You just don't see it, bitch!

520
01:00:02,817 --> 01:00:04,942
Tell me or I'll smash your head!

521
01:00:04,983 --> 01:00:06,858
Where is it?

522
01:00:06,900 --> 01:00:08,483
My sister also left because of
you!

523
01:00:08,817 --> 01:00:10,317
You made my sister leave!

524
01:00:22,275 --> 01:00:23,567
Where have you kept it!

525
01:00:24,025 --> 01:00:25,900
Where is it?!

526
01:00:39,567 --> 01:00:40,733
Dharam!

527
01:00:44,775 --> 01:00:45,983
- Step down.
- Fuck off!

528
01:00:48,942 --> 01:00:51,608
I'm the boss of this house, got
it!?

529
01:00:51,650 --> 01:00:54,025
I'm your husband, not your
slave!

530
01:03:39,025 --> 01:03:42,567
I had such high hopes for you.
And this is how you behave!

531
01:04:21,983 --> 01:04:23,358
Two thousand for firewood!

532
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:25,275
I'm not asking for sandalwood,
man!

533
01:04:25,775 --> 01:04:28,692
It's 800 for a quintal, right?
Let's settle at 1000!

534
01:04:36,817 --> 01:04:38,317
Will you have tea?

535
01:04:41,733 --> 01:04:43,400
I'll get you milk with turmeric.

536
01:04:48,983 --> 01:04:50,608
Put your hands down.

537
01:04:52,442 --> 01:04:53,817
Keep your feet straight.

538
01:04:57,983 --> 01:04:59,983
Get ready for English pledge.

539
01:05:00,567 --> 01:05:02,942
India is my country.

540
01:05:02,983 --> 01:05:05,942
All Indians are my

541
01:05:05,983 --> 01:05:07,900
brothers and sisters.

542
01:05:07,942 --> 01:05:09,858
I love my country.

543
01:05:09,900 --> 01:05:12,650
I am proud of

544
01:05:12,692 --> 01:05:16,358
her history and varied heritage.

545
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:19,608
To my country, and my people,

546
01:05:19,650 --> 01:05:21,983
I pledge my devotion.

547
01:05:24,942 --> 01:05:26,817
Get ready for national anthem.

548
01:05:29,525 --> 01:05:30,525
Bloody hell!

549
01:05:30,567 --> 01:05:32,983
This video will be
a sensation on TukTuk!

550
01:05:40,025 --> 01:05:42,025
Sir, Chandra is calling.

551
01:05:42,233 --> 01:05:44,650
She's called me ten
times since morning!

552
01:06:00,983 --> 01:06:05,025
'Prime Minister Village Roads
Plan'

553
01:06:06,858 --> 01:06:09,733
After eating chowmein,
we'll go hiking in the forest. - Yes.

554
01:06:09,942 --> 01:06:12,775
We'll butcher a hen in there.
- I don't eat chicken.

555
01:06:12,817 --> 01:06:13,942
You don't?

556
01:06:13,983 --> 01:06:15,692
Hey sister!

557
01:06:15,733 --> 01:06:17,942
The kids took Prakash
to the other field.

558
01:06:21,525 --> 01:06:22,983
I eat paneer, not chicken.

559
01:06:23,025 --> 01:06:24,775
So, you don't eat chicken.

560
01:06:31,567 --> 01:06:32,900
Where are you looking at?

561
01:06:32,942 --> 01:06:35,275
Look up at me!
Stop crying, you pussy!

562
01:06:35,983 --> 01:06:37,025
Get up!

563
01:06:37,775 --> 01:06:39,275
Pansy-ass... Faggot!

564
01:06:39,775 --> 01:06:41,275
Get up, cripple!

565
01:06:41,900 --> 01:06:43,275
Look up!

566
01:06:43,317 --> 01:06:44,733
Look up here.

567
01:06:44,942 --> 01:06:46,692
- You wanna wear a bra?
- Prakash!

568
01:07:01,942 --> 01:07:03,775
Stop crying!

569
01:07:04,025 --> 01:07:05,525
Stop it!

570
01:07:09,817 --> 01:07:11,275
Shut up!

571
01:07:23,983 --> 01:07:25,733
Don't you have hands?

572
01:07:25,775 --> 01:07:27,317
Stop crying like a girl!

573
01:07:55,858 --> 01:07:57,358
Hello, Sister!

574
01:07:57,608 --> 01:07:58,983
You didn't go to find
customers today?

575
01:07:59,025 --> 01:08:00,275
Where's the chief?

576
01:08:00,317 --> 01:08:01,900
He left this morning.

577
01:08:01,942 --> 01:08:03,775
- When is he back?
- He didn't say.

578
01:08:04,817 --> 01:08:06,858
Did he say anything about the
road?

579
01:08:07,608 --> 01:08:10,732
No sister. He never mentioned
it!

580
01:08:15,317 --> 01:08:18,275
Sister. The cripple
won't get the road built.

581
01:08:18,317 --> 01:08:21,567
If the village gets a road,
how will his hotel run?

582
01:08:21,607 --> 01:08:23,400
Don't waste your time.

583
01:10:50,358 --> 01:10:51,858
It's got 62,000 likes!

584
01:14:13,525 --> 01:14:17,483
All of you... All of you will
pay.

585
01:14:18,025 --> 01:14:21,067
All of you will pay.

586
01:14:23,358 --> 01:14:24,900
Everyone is corrupt.

587
01:14:25,317 --> 01:14:26,900
I'm going to rip you up.

588
01:14:27,275 --> 01:14:28,775
I'm going to rip you all apart.

589
01:14:30,733 --> 01:14:32,442
You want to do your Jagar?

590
01:14:32,483 --> 01:14:33,567
Do it.

591
01:14:34,567 --> 01:14:35,983
DO IT!

592
01:14:41,567 --> 01:14:43,817
Drop it.

593
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:45,775
Give it here.

594
01:14:48,025 --> 01:14:49,233
Chief.

595
01:14:49,275 --> 01:14:50,400
Where are you running away?

596
01:15:11,775 --> 01:15:12,900
Bitch.

597
01:15:16,775 --> 01:15:18,442
How dare you touch her!

598
01:15:18,983 --> 01:15:20,608
How dare you touch her!

599
01:15:20,942 --> 01:15:23,400
Hey, Dharam! Dharam!

600
01:15:23,442 --> 01:15:25,733
Dharam, he'll die.

601
01:15:28,775 --> 01:15:30,733
Hail Goddess!

602
01:15:30,775 --> 01:15:32,942

Chandra!

608
01:17:04,983 --> 01:17:06,775
Get up Mummy! Get up!

609
01:17:14,233 --> 01:17:15,442
Mummy get up!

610
01:17:15,900 --> 01:17:16,983

611
01:17:17,025 --> 01:17:18,483
- Mummy.

01:17:18,525 --> 01:17:20,317

01:17:20,358 --> 01:17:22,900
