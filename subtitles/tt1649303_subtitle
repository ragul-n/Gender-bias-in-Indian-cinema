1
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:42,360
No man can live his life
without a love and a friend,

2
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:45,461
some friendships end
in childhood itself.

3
00:00:45,665 --> 00:00:48,927
Many friendships end
with college,

4
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:54,164
1980, a batch of students leaving
college after finishing studies...

5
00:00:54,366 --> 00:00:57,264
Getting late to bus,
give me your autograph.

6
00:00:57,467 --> 00:00:58,161
Why?

7
00:00:58,367 --> 00:01:00,265
Don't know when we'll meet again.

8
00:01:01,067 --> 00:01:03,693
Our friendship will not
end with autographs,

9
00:01:04,335 --> 00:01:06,426
friendship doesn't mean
living together in college,

10
00:01:06,769 --> 00:01:09,031
but sharing joys and griefs
all the life together.

11
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,365
Let's meet whenever it's possible.

12
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:14,196
It's easier said than done.

13
00:01:14,404 --> 00:01:18,030
If we strongly wish to meet,
we can under any circumstances.

14
00:01:18,238 --> 00:01:19,670
We can meet how far we may be.

15
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:21,095
I'll arrange for our meeting.

16
00:01:21,305 --> 00:01:27,206
Have you finished eating?
Canteen is closing.

17
00:01:36,241 --> 00:01:37,605
Get down from the stage!

18
00:01:38,242 --> 00:01:41,107
What's this? You're married
and have children too,

19
00:01:41,342 --> 00:01:42,274
still haven't changed.

20
00:01:42,476 --> 00:01:46,432
We're meeting to have fun
and re-energise our lives.

21
00:01:46,643 --> 00:01:47,268
Get down.

22
00:01:47,477 --> 00:01:51,274
Notjust we, our families too
must re-energise.

23
00:01:53,245 --> 00:01:54,609
My son will perform a dance now.

24
00:02:10,715 --> 00:02:13,204
My daughter will dance now.

25
00:02:32,587 --> 00:02:34,280
Stop talking now, had food?

26
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:37,215
We did have, he'll never change.

27
00:02:38,254 --> 00:02:41,618
My business deal is done,
I'll settle down in Switzerland.

28
00:02:42,322 --> 00:02:46,278
I'm shifting my office to Delhi,
I'll stay there only.

29
00:02:46,489 --> 00:02:49,115
We were meeting
since we lived near by,

30
00:02:49,323 --> 00:02:51,381
will it be possible to meet
if you go far away places?

31
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:53,954
We decided then and
met now, right?

32
00:02:54,157 --> 00:02:56,021
Where there's a will,
there's a way.

33
00:02:56,258 --> 00:02:58,451
We'll surely meet, watch out.
- Definitely.

34
00:03:00,325 --> 00:03:02,224
Prabha, come here.

35
00:03:03,493 --> 00:03:04,356
What's it uncle?

36
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:05,953
Your dance was excellent.

37
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,626
Which class?
- Seventh class, uncle.

38
00:03:07,993 --> 00:03:09,357
Is it? Which rank?

39
00:03:10,194 --> 00:03:11,682
That's the biggest problem with him.

40
00:03:12,595 --> 00:03:14,026
Seventh class second year.

41
00:03:14,495 --> 00:03:18,451
Stop dances and
start concentrating on studies.

42
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:54,665
Hey! Who are you?

43
00:07:50,551 --> 00:07:56,348
It seems above the sky,
there are stars...

44
00:07:56,552 --> 00:07:58,178
So what?

45
00:07:58,386 --> 00:08:03,342
When I dance,
every star must come down...

46
00:08:43,328 --> 00:08:46,692
Don't know who will become what...

47
00:08:47,062 --> 00:08:50,188
Don't know who will meet whom...

48
00:08:50,396 --> 00:08:57,422
If friend becomes your shadow,
the fun will never stop...

49
00:08:58,064 --> 00:09:01,622
Man having blast today is
the hero of tomorrow...

50
00:09:29,337 --> 00:09:32,702
If you don't dream thinking
dreams will not come true...

51
00:09:33,071 --> 00:09:36,197
You'll miss the happiness
of the dream...

52
00:09:37,306 --> 00:09:43,706
Nothing will change with date
if you remain as yourself...

53
00:09:44,074 --> 00:09:47,370
Roaming like a wastrel
is also luck, that's all...

54
00:10:20,848 --> 00:10:22,542
I'll pick you up at 9 am
tomorrow, right?

55
00:10:25,216 --> 00:10:25,704
What?

56
00:10:29,683 --> 00:10:30,547
Joke?

57
00:10:34,251 --> 00:10:36,046
Sorry, I don't have any such idea.

58
00:10:45,453 --> 00:10:48,214
Why is your voice dull, Nisha?

59
00:10:48,687 --> 00:10:49,778
Tell me dear, no problem.

60
00:10:50,354 --> 00:10:52,286
You keep everything to yourself,
never share anything with me.

61
00:10:52,487 --> 00:10:53,214
Brother...

62
00:10:53,421 --> 00:10:55,717
Flyover contract has been
bagged by Rao's Company.

63
00:10:56,088 --> 00:10:57,486
We've lost Rs. 30 crores.

64
00:10:59,289 --> 00:11:02,653
How many times I've told you not to
disturb when I'm talking to my daughter?

65
00:11:05,257 --> 00:11:10,384
Dear, I'll come late to home.
You eat, dear.

66
00:11:32,796 --> 00:11:36,456
You don't need English
to convey emotions.

67
00:11:37,097 --> 00:11:38,392
Any language will do.

68
00:11:38,597 --> 00:11:41,120
I can understand the tension
you're feeling to manage,

69
00:11:41,698 --> 00:11:44,062
and also the intention behind it.

70
00:11:45,165 --> 00:11:48,723
Tell me... how much you
took from them?

71
00:11:49,099 --> 00:11:50,725
No sir, I didn't take anything.

72
00:11:51,099 --> 00:11:55,226
Really sir. Trust me...
- Rs.30 crores is not a big deal.

73
00:11:55,601 --> 00:11:57,226
I can earn it in 3 days.

74
00:11:57,467 --> 00:12:03,402
But you betrayed me,
I won't tolerate it.

75
00:12:03,602 --> 00:12:05,068
Tell me, how much you
took from them?

76
00:12:05,436 --> 00:12:07,561
I made a mistake,
please forgive me sir.

77
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:08,394
I beg you sir, please leave me.

78
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:14,329
I'll spare anyone but
not a betrayer.

79
00:12:14,705 --> 00:12:18,229
If I've to leave,
then I'll leave like this.

80
00:12:27,807 --> 00:12:29,137
She's Prabhas' mother.

81
00:12:29,341 --> 00:12:33,240
Though she's trying to learn English for
30 years using a learn yourself book,

82
00:12:33,442 --> 00:12:35,135
she hasn't yet picked up
30 words too.

83
00:12:35,342 --> 00:12:37,808
An incident happened in city
that evoked lot of interest,

84
00:12:38,343 --> 00:12:40,241
like every brain has an idea
and every tongue has a taste,

85
00:12:40,443 --> 00:12:43,069
a group of college students
celebrated their farewell,

86
00:12:43,277 --> 00:12:47,539
on different roads with dances
instead of college campus.

87
00:12:47,744 --> 00:12:50,142
Traffic was disrupted in
many places because of it.

88
00:12:52,612 --> 00:12:55,511
Prabha! You're ruining
family honour.

89
00:12:55,713 --> 00:12:58,736
Is it the way you go to college?
I'll complain to your father.

90
00:12:59,113 --> 00:13:02,171
Watch live updates
on it every hour,

91
00:13:02,381 --> 00:13:04,745
keep watching the
uninterrupted live telecast.

92
00:13:11,682 --> 00:13:13,308
Have you seen on TV?

93
00:13:13,782 --> 00:13:15,476
I'll come home and watch it.

94
00:13:15,683 --> 00:13:19,241
Your son is dancing on roads.
Our honour is going to dogs.

95
00:13:20,718 --> 00:13:22,650
I'm already tensed,
cut the line.

96
00:13:29,119 --> 00:13:32,518
Stop... stop... the car.

97
00:13:33,454 --> 00:13:35,249
Who do you think he is?
Criminal lawyer Hanumantha Rao.

98
00:13:35,454 --> 00:13:36,420
That's why I'm stopping.

99
00:13:36,621 --> 00:13:39,486
Do you know what you're saying?
- What's the problem there?

100
00:13:44,789 --> 00:13:46,755
How many times I've told him
yet he has no sense.

101
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:54,257
Why do you come so many
times and get insulted?

102
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:56,856
Please never come again, sir.
We'll lose ourjobs.

103
00:14:07,294 --> 00:14:08,419
Who is it?
- Father!

104
00:14:09,127 --> 00:14:11,593
What's this father?
Travelling in a Benz!

105
00:14:13,395 --> 00:14:16,419
Belongs to a client.
- Client's.

106
00:14:16,629 --> 00:14:18,425
You go, tell sir, I'll call him.
- Okay sir.

107
00:14:20,463 --> 00:14:21,088
Go.

108
00:14:21,297 --> 00:14:23,263
A birthday party,
you're not coming with us.

109
00:14:24,564 --> 00:14:26,587
I'll come there.
- How can you? Will he leave you?

110
00:14:26,797 --> 00:14:28,593
I'll jump the wall.
- Go home!

111
00:14:53,603 --> 00:14:55,592
...dancing in public,
everybody is watching...

112
00:15:00,471 --> 00:15:03,097
Oh mother! Please don't kill us
with your English.

113
00:15:04,772 --> 00:15:07,330
Has mother become
so cheap to you?

114
00:15:09,473 --> 00:15:11,701
When you were in Inter,
I thought it was upto home only,

115
00:15:11,907 --> 00:15:14,305
when in college, I thought it
was upto district only,

116
00:15:14,507 --> 00:15:19,338
do you've to make it a state wide
issue if you pass graduation?

117
00:15:22,309 --> 00:15:24,707
In which channel?
- Gemini TV.

118
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:27,604
Don't you've any shame, son?
Just one Gemini TV only?

119
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:29,503
Couldn't make it to NDTV?

120
00:15:30,477 --> 00:15:31,671
BBC?

121
00:15:32,177 --> 00:15:33,302
CNN?

122
00:15:33,511 --> 00:15:36,376
My fate! Father and son will
never reform in this life.

123
00:15:36,579 --> 00:15:39,374
How is my performance?
- Shattering dad.

124
00:15:39,579 --> 00:15:41,239
I thought you'd lash me
with a belt.

125
00:15:41,446 --> 00:15:44,674
I'd have done it, but if I remove
belt, pant will come down.

126
00:15:45,813 --> 00:15:47,177
I love you dad!

127
00:15:47,781 --> 00:15:53,578
NDTV, BBC?
Family honour is going to dogs.

128
00:15:53,782 --> 00:15:57,340
Rajeshwari, that was his
last day in college,

129
00:15:57,549 --> 00:16:00,879
birthdays, marriage days will
come every year,

130
00:16:01,317 --> 00:16:04,681
but farewell day comes
only once in life.

131
00:16:09,319 --> 00:16:10,285
Who is tomato?

132
00:16:10,486 --> 00:16:12,452
Who else, you!

133
00:16:14,452 --> 00:16:15,612
Keep quiet.

134
00:16:24,488 --> 00:16:26,512
Hi Aunty! - When did you come
from Vizag? - Today.

135
00:16:26,722 --> 00:16:30,416
She did her MBA here, we went to
college for her certificates,

136
00:16:30,623 --> 00:16:31,850
but called us tomorrow,
I said Prabha will come for it.

137
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:34,820
Where's brother?
Haven't met him for long time?

138
00:16:35,658 --> 00:16:36,624
I'm in bathroom, just a minute.

139
00:16:36,824 --> 00:16:37,448
He'll come.

140
00:16:37,658 --> 00:16:39,420
It seems girls in my college
are not beautiful,

141
00:16:39,624 --> 00:16:42,182
so he's not coming to me also,
you know that?

142
00:16:42,392 --> 00:16:43,358
Like father like son!

143
00:16:48,326 --> 00:16:51,452
Hubby! Viswanadham from Swiss.

144
00:16:54,827 --> 00:16:55,793
What?

145
00:16:56,328 --> 00:16:59,624
Are you coming to India in 2 days
with your son and daughter?

146
00:17:01,329 --> 00:17:02,625
Will Bhadram give other details?

147
00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:06,819
What's this?

148
00:17:07,196 --> 00:17:10,755
Yes, we all friends are having
a get together meet in my home.

149
00:17:10,964 --> 00:17:13,124
No, usually I arrange
the meeting, right?

150
00:17:13,332 --> 00:17:17,287
We wanted to surprize you,
last time everyone didn't turn up.

151
00:17:17,499 --> 00:17:20,432
This time it's special,
after 10 years,

152
00:17:20,633 --> 00:17:23,565
all our friends are coming
with their families.

153
00:17:23,767 --> 00:17:28,167
Let's have a blast re-living those
olden golden college days.

154
00:17:28,368 --> 00:17:35,530
We'll never give up
this friendship...

155
00:17:35,736 --> 00:17:37,531
Why are you getting
so emotional, son?

156
00:17:39,404 --> 00:17:40,267
On whom?

157
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:42,732
Aren't your friends my friends?

158
00:17:47,505 --> 00:17:50,301
We are meeting after ten years.
Let's rock, father.

159
00:17:50,506 --> 00:17:51,631
No way!

160
00:17:52,472 --> 00:17:53,131
Why?

161
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:56,204
We've to arrange a lot of things,
we are leaving today.

162
00:17:56,407 --> 00:17:58,431
Go to college tomorrow,
take the certificate and come.

163
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,801
Uncle... uncle...
- Just do as uncle says.

164
00:18:05,409 --> 00:18:08,376
You can't avoid brother,
I need my certificates.

165
00:18:08,575 --> 00:18:10,804
Always troublesome.

166
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:12,500
Sensational!

167
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:13,573
What? My music?

168
00:18:13,777 --> 00:18:14,573
Your beard!

169
00:18:14,778 --> 00:18:17,471
Friends meeting after 10 years
with their families,

170
00:18:17,678 --> 00:18:19,372
isn't it great to hear?

171
00:18:19,844 --> 00:18:22,277
We'll also join you.
We'll also have a good time.

172
00:18:22,478 --> 00:18:25,206
I don't want you there,
you'll spoil my fun.

173
00:18:25,579 --> 00:18:28,341
You always stop us,
are we competitors to you?

174
00:18:28,547 --> 00:18:29,808
Look at your height and ours,

175
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:31,305
you don't care much
about your friends,

176
00:18:31,514 --> 00:18:33,707
you don't give any value
to friendship...

177
00:18:34,914 --> 00:18:37,813
He'll not speak any more,
take him away.

178
00:18:38,549 --> 00:18:40,538
You managed him, we'll come,
what will you do?

179
00:18:40,749 --> 00:18:42,715
Can I avoid?
I'll take you.

180
00:18:45,817 --> 00:18:47,840
Did Nisha propose to you yesterday?

181
00:18:48,584 --> 00:18:49,914
She did. So what?
- What did you tell her?

182
00:18:50,284 --> 00:18:52,910
What would I say?
Don't you know about my love story?

183
00:18:53,285 --> 00:18:56,150
I'm waiting for Nandhini,
how can I say yes to Nisha?

184
00:18:57,186 --> 00:18:59,448
We're in trouble,
she tried to commit suicide.

185
00:18:59,653 --> 00:19:01,710
What? Suicide?

186
00:19:02,187 --> 00:19:05,551
Yes, she's in hospital now.
Her condition is very serious.

187
00:19:08,854 --> 00:19:10,320
Where are you going?
- Hospital.

188
00:19:10,522 --> 00:19:11,886
You'll not come back alive
from there.

189
00:19:12,256 --> 00:19:13,552
Do you know who her father is?

190
00:19:22,491 --> 00:19:25,218
For your safety,
run away to some other place.

191
00:19:26,525 --> 00:19:27,150
Why should I run away?

192
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:28,949
Because his daughter has
tried to commit suicide.

193
00:19:29,326 --> 00:19:31,884
He'll not only spare you
but your family too.

194
00:19:34,927 --> 00:19:36,586
I'm going to station along
with Bhadram,

195
00:19:36,794 --> 00:19:38,885
your mother has gone to Ameerpet
to shop with Prasanna.

196
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:41,285
You pick up and
drop them in station.

197
00:19:41,494 --> 00:19:42,392
Okay dad.

198
00:19:43,495 --> 00:19:46,893
We are going to Vizag tomorrow, right?
Why not today itself?

199
00:19:55,197 --> 00:19:56,425
Tell me where's Prahhas?
- Don't know.

200
00:19:56,631 --> 00:19:57,824
Tell me... tell me...
- I don't know.

201
00:19:58,198 --> 00:19:59,255
Tell me!

202
00:20:05,566 --> 00:20:09,226
Tell me!
- I don't know.

203
00:20:16,202 --> 00:20:16,826
Tell me!

204
00:20:17,669 --> 00:20:19,191
Nisha's father has sent
his goons for you.

205
00:20:19,402 --> 00:20:22,164
They are beating up our friends,
I managed to give them a slip,

206
00:20:22,936 --> 00:20:24,232
I took a video of them
beating our friends,

207
00:20:24,437 --> 00:20:26,835
they may come for you,
so I'm sending you MMS,

208
00:20:27,204 --> 00:20:27,828
be careful, buddy!

209
00:20:48,308 --> 00:20:49,569
Walk faster.

210
00:20:50,242 --> 00:20:51,935
They'll be waiting for us
in railway station.

211
00:20:56,943 --> 00:20:58,239
Where's brother?

212
00:20:58,777 --> 00:21:00,743
How is it?
- Yuck! No!

213
00:21:01,345 --> 00:21:02,902
Not good?
You come.

214
00:21:03,511 --> 00:21:04,738
We are getting late.

215
00:21:20,315 --> 00:21:21,871
Shall we see some bags
in that shop, aunty?

216
00:21:22,248 --> 00:21:24,407
No, let's go. Come fast.

217
00:21:38,885 --> 00:21:40,408
Come to that shop.

218
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:51,852
Two for Rs.100!

219
00:22:01,223 --> 00:22:02,849
Brother! Pant!

220
00:22:17,226 --> 00:22:19,852
Why are they quoting
high rates like a shop?

221
00:22:22,594 --> 00:22:23,560
How much?

222
00:22:29,695 --> 00:22:30,753
What happened?

223
00:23:02,335 --> 00:23:03,801
My sweet son!
- Yes.

224
00:23:06,536 --> 00:23:08,559
Brainless fellows!
How they are fighting on roads?

225
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:10,596
Don't know from where they come?

226
00:23:10,838 --> 00:23:14,930
They must be taken to police station
and given a good thrashing.

227
00:23:15,338 --> 00:23:17,770
Don't stare at them,
don't look at them.

228
00:23:24,873 --> 00:23:26,772
What's it son?
- Love, mother, love...

229
00:23:33,575 --> 00:23:35,769
Auto, take them to railway station.

230
00:23:40,744 --> 00:23:42,437
I'm Nisha's father.

231
00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:45,299
You must be with me in 10 minutes.

232
00:23:45,511 --> 00:23:46,204
What if I refuse?

233
00:23:46,411 --> 00:23:48,934
You beat my men and
left them alive,

234
00:23:49,412 --> 00:23:53,936
I'll never commit such a mistake,
your friends are with me,

235
00:23:54,313 --> 00:23:56,211
you love your friends, don't you?

236
00:23:56,413 --> 00:23:58,811
You'll definitely come.
I know it.

237
00:23:59,414 --> 00:24:01,972
Why are you inviting him here
without bumping him off there, boss?

238
00:24:06,915 --> 00:24:08,245
What did you say your name was?

239
00:24:08,449 --> 00:24:10,540
It's Prabhas, right?

240
00:24:11,249 --> 00:24:14,444
Look, my daughter is mad.

241
00:24:15,017 --> 00:24:17,506
She always hides
everything in heart,

242
00:24:17,717 --> 00:24:20,206
that's why she tried
to commit suicide,

243
00:24:20,418 --> 00:24:22,782
if she had told me she loves you,

244
00:24:22,985 --> 00:24:25,577
I would've got you both
married by now.

245
00:24:25,786 --> 00:24:28,548
But, you're very lucky.

246
00:24:30,587 --> 00:24:33,781
If anything had happened to her,
by now you'd be...

247
00:24:36,254 --> 00:24:39,346
Day after tomorrow you're
marrying my daughter, be ready.

248
00:24:39,555 --> 00:24:42,283
Marriage...
- Ask your parents to meet me.

249
00:24:43,256 --> 00:24:44,483
I don't like this marriage.

250
00:24:48,557 --> 00:24:52,285
Stop... okay, I'll marry her.

251
00:24:53,025 --> 00:24:54,855
But please listen to me once.

252
00:24:56,759 --> 00:25:00,886
Nisha is really lucky to have
such a loving father like you.

253
00:25:02,659 --> 00:25:07,718
She'll be happy only when the man
she marries her loves as much.

254
00:25:09,561 --> 00:25:12,823
Love and marriage happens only
when both like each other.

255
00:25:13,029 --> 00:25:14,552
What are you saying?

256
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:15,956
Why don't you like it?

257
00:25:17,263 --> 00:25:19,024
Tell me, why don't you like it?

258
00:25:19,397 --> 00:25:23,455
Because, my heart is not with me.

259
00:25:25,965 --> 00:25:30,989
Last year I went to Switzerland
for a music program.

260
00:25:44,735 --> 00:25:46,963
I've told the organiser of
Swiss Telugu association,

261
00:25:47,336 --> 00:25:50,791
that you all are right and left hands
of AR Rahman and Mani Sharma.

262
00:25:51,003 --> 00:25:54,800
20 days and Rs.20 lakhs,
enjoy the summer holidays.

263
00:25:55,670 --> 00:26:00,330
You must leave in 2 days.
I've already mailed them this photo.

264
00:26:00,538 --> 00:26:03,801
Did you see?
Rahman, Mani Sharma and Devisri.

265
00:26:04,706 --> 00:26:06,797
Will it work out, buddy?

266
00:26:07,673 --> 00:26:10,468
You can sing, you will,
but we don't know much.

267
00:26:10,673 --> 00:26:12,640
Just follow my style.

268
00:26:33,745 --> 00:26:35,371
I feel like children of Goddess of
Learning have come down.

269
00:26:35,578 --> 00:26:37,477
Who are they?
Are they also here to sing?

270
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:38,667
Who is this half baked man?

271
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,369
He doesn't have much
command on language.

272
00:26:40,579 --> 00:26:42,375
Language? Is he also a singer?

273
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:43,841
Why didn't you tell me?

274
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:45,744
Buddy, it's very easy
to manage him.

275
00:26:46,281 --> 00:26:47,474
You must give me all
the details, right?

276
00:26:50,449 --> 00:26:50,914
Did you have food?

277
00:26:51,282 --> 00:26:53,271
They will, just now got
down from the flight,

278
00:26:53,482 --> 00:26:54,641
they'll freshen up and eat.

279
00:27:05,452 --> 00:27:07,975
Who amongst you is
left hand of Rahman?

280
00:27:08,719 --> 00:27:10,481
Me sir! It's me!

281
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:15,750
Rahman is very close to me.
- You could've told me that earlier.

282
00:27:16,287 --> 00:27:17,844
Why are you getting so tensed?

283
00:27:18,055 --> 00:27:20,521
Rahman always tell me
that's your weakness.

284
00:27:20,721 --> 00:27:21,948
Victory!

285
00:27:23,355 --> 00:27:26,845
Victory?
My heart almost stopped.

286
00:27:27,423 --> 00:27:29,685
Will you have food?
- They will eat, keep quiet.

287
00:27:34,791 --> 00:27:36,348
Still 4 days to start the program,

288
00:27:36,558 --> 00:27:38,421
till then...
- Want us to enjoy?

289
00:27:38,625 --> 00:27:40,023
Practice!

290
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:42,348
We've arranged this program
spending big money,

291
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:45,583
if anything goes wrong...
- You'll see our talent.

292
00:27:45,793 --> 00:27:49,624
What talent? Michael Jackson
rocked the world by your age.

293
00:27:49,827 --> 00:27:52,020
Do you know, Hitler committed
suicide by your age?

294
00:27:52,628 --> 00:27:53,286
Nothing about you sir.

295
00:27:53,494 --> 00:27:55,586
Boys, get going.
- Yes, coming.

296
00:28:33,836 --> 00:28:37,360
What a place!
- Yes, indeed very nice!

297
00:28:57,075 --> 00:28:58,870
Hello, go speed.

298
00:29:05,342 --> 00:29:07,570
Go slow!

299
00:29:18,611 --> 00:29:20,510
She's going away...
take left... take left.

300
00:29:20,712 --> 00:29:21,575
We're going right side.

301
00:29:21,779 --> 00:29:23,075
You bloody!

302
00:29:30,815 --> 00:29:35,373
You can go without underwear but
never go out without your passport.

303
00:29:35,582 --> 00:29:40,345
If you get caught with police,
you'll be behind bars for a week.

304
00:29:40,616 --> 00:29:42,082
Oh no! I don't have my passport.

305
00:29:46,317 --> 00:29:48,045
Where are you going, Prabha?

306
00:29:48,684 --> 00:29:50,275
Go left.
- We must go right.

307
00:29:50,485 --> 00:29:51,348
Bloody!

308
00:32:13,614 --> 00:32:15,376
How many times you've come late?
- It was my mistake.

309
00:32:15,581 --> 00:32:16,877
It's not mistake but your habit.

310
00:32:17,748 --> 00:32:18,907
Don't pay her.

311
00:32:19,116 --> 00:32:20,877
Don't ever call her again
to sing in chorus.

312
00:32:25,117 --> 00:32:26,083
I'll never commit such
a mistake again.

313
00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:28,814
Please give me an opportunity
to confess, Father.

314
00:32:29,017 --> 00:32:30,915
How many times
should I forgive you?

315
00:32:31,118 --> 00:32:35,710
This is better.
- Please listen to me Father.

316
00:32:38,519 --> 00:32:40,110
You fall at feet,
this is bad habit.

317
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,712
They say you mustn't hide anything
from father and church Father.

318
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,580
That's why I'll tell you a truth.

319
00:32:47,354 --> 00:32:48,081
What is it?

320
00:32:48,354 --> 00:32:50,980
My dad was drinking entire night
despite I warned him not to,

321
00:32:51,355 --> 00:32:54,617
I too had a little getting curious
of what really does it have?

322
00:32:56,356 --> 00:32:58,345
Did you drink?
Why did you do like that?

323
00:32:58,556 --> 00:33:00,546
Fate, Father.

324
00:33:01,124 --> 00:33:02,055
What happened then?

325
00:33:02,557 --> 00:33:04,989
I understood my father.
- What's that?

326
00:33:05,858 --> 00:33:07,882
Another peg will be better.

327
00:33:08,425 --> 00:33:09,550
What happened then?

328
00:33:09,758 --> 00:33:12,748
What will happen?
I had a full bottle, Father

329
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:17,984
When I woke up, it was 9 am.
That's why I came late to church.

330
00:33:22,495 --> 00:33:23,018
You sinner!

331
00:33:23,394 --> 00:33:27,020
If I allow you into church,
you'll spoil other girls too.

332
00:33:27,996 --> 00:33:31,485
Take off this holy dress and
leave the church immediately.

333
00:33:45,466 --> 00:33:46,989
Keep the dress here
and leave the church.

334
00:34:03,369 --> 00:34:04,835
How am I to start it?

335
00:34:15,439 --> 00:34:16,427
What a figure!

336
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:17,570
Telugu girl!

337
00:34:54,846 --> 00:34:56,403
I know face reading.

338
00:34:58,381 --> 00:35:01,142
Once I look at anyone
I can tell their horoscope.

339
00:35:05,048 --> 00:35:08,572
God gave you an angel's beauty
but a devil's heart.

340
00:35:17,818 --> 00:35:20,683
You're eating a stolen
chocolate now.

341
00:35:22,652 --> 00:35:24,084
You've the habit of stealing
two things at time,

342
00:35:24,453 --> 00:35:26,681
it's in your bag, you steal two
things on asking anything,

343
00:35:26,887 --> 00:35:28,750
stop... come here.

344
00:35:29,754 --> 00:35:32,914
The lips that should taste only nectar,
did you drink till late night?

345
00:35:34,889 --> 00:35:38,083
One peg... no, two pegs
...three pegs!

346
00:35:38,688 --> 00:35:39,746
A full bottle?!

347
00:35:47,957 --> 00:35:49,423
Get lost man!

348
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:02,484
Why are you murdering the song?

349
00:36:02,693 --> 00:36:04,057
They'll understand it like this only.

350
00:36:05,461 --> 00:36:06,620
Where's Prabha?
It's time to practice.

351
00:36:06,828 --> 00:36:08,851
How can he be here?
He met a Telugu girl, right?

352
00:36:09,061 --> 00:36:10,925
He would've gone after her.
- For a girl?

353
00:36:12,396 --> 00:36:15,157
You can escape from police also,

354
00:36:15,530 --> 00:36:19,861
if you fall for any Telugu girl here,
you're dead.

355
00:36:20,064 --> 00:36:23,758
Telugu people are so powerful
and dangerous here.

356
00:36:25,465 --> 00:36:27,364
Did we come this far to die?

357
00:36:27,566 --> 00:36:28,725
The only one who knows
music is Prabha,

358
00:36:28,932 --> 00:36:30,592
we came here trusting him
to make some money,

359
00:36:30,799 --> 00:36:31,594
now we are in a fix?

360
00:36:31,799 --> 00:36:33,459
If we leave him,
our program will get upset,

361
00:36:33,667 --> 00:36:34,155
you do something.

362
00:36:34,534 --> 00:36:36,625
Why is he telling us
to do something?

363
00:36:38,401 --> 00:36:39,867
What's this your voice is changed?

364
00:36:42,035 --> 00:36:45,763
Music troupe from India?
- It's us!

365
00:36:47,537 --> 00:36:48,662
No problem.

366
00:36:50,403 --> 00:36:52,563
I love music.
- We too.

367
00:36:52,770 --> 00:36:55,862
I heard you don't have female singer,
so I'm here to sing for you.

368
00:36:56,071 --> 00:36:57,934
Please give me one chance sir.

369
00:36:58,172 --> 00:37:01,935
We can but do you've any
singing experience? - Buddy!

370
00:37:02,406 --> 00:37:05,463
Chorus singer in church.
- Chorus?

371
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:07,938
He's a pain. What's it?

372
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:10,073
Prabhas saw this girl only.
- What?

373
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:13,066
Oh my God!
How am I to tell him?

374
00:37:16,608 --> 00:37:17,438
What?

375
00:37:17,975 --> 00:37:20,703
Who?
- What? SPB?

376
00:37:27,044 --> 00:37:31,171
He has now work, he recommends
to make Chitra sing for Shreya.

377
00:37:31,546 --> 00:37:32,705
Tell him, I'll call back later.

378
00:37:34,579 --> 00:37:37,943
Please get me that opportunity sir.
My voice will be good.

379
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,971
No need to sing now, come tomorrow
here at the same time.

380
00:37:41,181 --> 00:37:41,874
Let's think about it then.

381
00:37:44,514 --> 00:37:45,445
This is too much.

382
00:37:46,048 --> 00:37:49,173
We too had same feeling earlier.
- Bye sir.

383
00:37:50,749 --> 00:37:52,113
I'll come tomorrow at same time.
- Okay.

384
00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:56,879
Isn't she like heroine?

385
00:37:57,083 --> 00:37:58,845
Not like indeed she's the heroine.

386
00:37:59,051 --> 00:38:00,949
Telugu heroine in Switzerland!

387
00:38:01,151 --> 00:38:02,947
Prabha met this girl only
today morning.

388
00:38:03,151 --> 00:38:04,118
Why are you telling it now?

389
00:38:04,485 --> 00:38:05,110
Why didn't you tell me
that little earlier?

390
00:38:05,485 --> 00:38:07,145
I said about SPB's phone
to tell you that only.

391
00:38:07,519 --> 00:38:10,883
But you used it to build up
your image.

392
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:13,852
Bloody, she was some where else
you brought her next to him now.

393
00:38:14,054 --> 00:38:15,849
It'll be very easy for him
now to flatter her.

394
00:38:16,054 --> 00:38:19,146
I've no doubt, our bodies will
also not go back to India.

395
00:38:19,955 --> 00:38:24,048
Luckily we know her, it's very easy
to create misunderstanding between them.

396
00:38:40,859 --> 00:38:44,690
They have booked a room in star hotel,
what are you doing sitting out here?

397
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,949
Where did you go away
without practicing?

398
00:38:50,528 --> 00:38:51,687
Who is that girl?

399
00:38:52,028 --> 00:38:52,494
How did you find it?

400
00:38:52,695 --> 00:38:54,593
Can't I guess if you look
at sky like a mad man?

401
00:38:54,795 --> 00:38:57,728
You're right.
- Who is that girl?

402
00:38:58,930 --> 00:39:00,691
She's... she's... not a girl.

403
00:39:00,896 --> 00:39:04,193
Buddy, she's an angel who
has come down to earth.

404
00:39:04,564 --> 00:39:06,962
You don't feel too much,
let's send her back in some flight.

405
00:39:08,731 --> 00:39:10,720
Never take hasty decision in
selcting girl friend and cell phone.

406
00:39:10,932 --> 00:39:14,956
If you like and buy it, new models
will come later and tempt you.

407
00:39:17,099 --> 00:39:19,066
You'll not say this
if you see her.

408
00:39:19,434 --> 00:39:21,900
That is... he saw her!
- No, I didn't.

409
00:39:22,668 --> 00:39:23,429
He didn't see her.

410
00:39:23,634 --> 00:39:25,567
The girl touched my heart.

411
00:39:25,768 --> 00:39:27,667
Swiss girls do touch
your hearts only.

412
00:39:27,869 --> 00:39:29,732
A girl came today morning
to sing in our troupe.

413
00:39:29,936 --> 00:39:31,994
If you see her, I'm sure
you'll say I love you to her.

414
00:39:33,903 --> 00:39:37,392
Bloody... fool...
how do I look like to you?

415
00:39:37,604 --> 00:39:39,537
Would I say I love you
to any girl I meet?

416
00:39:39,737 --> 00:39:42,465
I'm sure you'll if you see her.
- No chance.

417
00:39:42,672 --> 00:39:43,569
What if you do?
- I will not.

418
00:39:43,772 --> 00:39:44,795
You'll fall in love if you see her.

419
00:39:45,005 --> 00:39:46,028
I will not.
- You will love her.

420
00:39:46,239 --> 00:39:47,671
I'll not love her.
- Then let's have a bet.

421
00:39:47,873 --> 00:39:49,396
What bloody bet?

422
00:39:49,606 --> 00:39:52,437
We'll show you that girl tomorrow,
if you feel like falling in love with her,

423
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,664
not only to her, you mustn't express
your love to any girl in Switzerland.

424
00:39:55,941 --> 00:39:58,999
Okay will not do,
we need a firm promise.

425
00:39:59,641 --> 00:40:00,630
Promise on him.

426
00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:05,107
Should I promise on my dad?

427
00:40:09,877 --> 00:40:11,741
I think our son is thinking about you.

428
00:40:13,611 --> 00:40:15,737
Buddy, think over it again.

429
00:40:15,945 --> 00:40:17,741
You can't change promise
after seeing her.

430
00:40:17,946 --> 00:40:19,003
You've promised on your dad.

431
00:40:19,213 --> 00:40:21,406
If anything happens to him...
- Why are you so scared?

432
00:40:21,613 --> 00:40:23,409
Will she be so beautiful?
Come... come... show me.

433
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:25,576
Where is she?
Come. Show me...

434
00:40:25,781 --> 00:40:27,179
No need to be so confident,
you'll fall flat.

435
00:40:30,782 --> 00:40:31,907
Where did he go away?

436
00:40:34,616 --> 00:40:35,081
Where is the girl?

437
00:40:35,449 --> 00:40:36,574
She said she's busy
and will not come,

438
00:40:36,783 --> 00:40:38,181
that girl in the bouquet shop.

439
00:40:39,983 --> 00:40:41,074
The girl in that shop?
- Yes, that girl only.

440
00:40:41,450 --> 00:40:42,746
The girl with bouquet?

441
00:40:51,919 --> 00:40:52,907
Isn't she like an angel?

442
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,076
You feel like saying I love you
to her, right? - No, I don't feel.

443
00:41:00,187 --> 00:41:01,744
Hastily I promised on my dad.

444
00:41:03,621 --> 00:41:05,747
But she's also very beautiful.

445
00:41:06,855 --> 00:41:07,843
I promised.
- Yes.

446
00:41:08,056 --> 00:41:10,818
I mustn't say I love you.
- Yes.

447
00:41:13,123 --> 00:41:14,589
How dare you fix me like this!

448
00:41:14,891 --> 00:41:16,016
What if she says it?

449
00:41:17,457 --> 00:41:18,424
Is it okay to you?

450
00:41:18,625 --> 00:41:19,750
Lt'll not break the promise, right?

451
00:41:20,825 --> 00:41:22,416
That girl will say I love you to me.

452
00:41:22,792 --> 00:41:25,156
That girl will say...
- Will she say?

453
00:41:28,793 --> 00:41:30,919
That girl... will say I love you.

454
00:41:34,962 --> 00:41:35,586
Shut up!

455
00:41:35,795 --> 00:41:37,852
You made him promise
and laughing now.

456
00:41:38,062 --> 00:41:40,028
We know about him well,

457
00:41:40,462 --> 00:41:42,019
do you know what we did
before this scene opened?

458
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:50,587
Looks like she has this disease.

459
00:41:53,131 --> 00:41:56,757
I heard your voice by rewinding
last evening's encounter.

460
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:02,494
I've decided to use your voice.

461
00:42:05,467 --> 00:42:08,593
If you sing in my troupe,
you'll be on moon in future,

462
00:42:08,802 --> 00:42:10,165
your life will change completely,

463
00:42:10,535 --> 00:42:13,161
but we've a small problem.
- What's it sir?

464
00:42:14,469 --> 00:42:16,935
That is... I don't know
how am I to tell you?

465
00:42:17,136 --> 00:42:18,693
No problem, please tell me sir.

466
00:42:18,903 --> 00:42:21,768
There's a 6 feet, six pack Prabha
in my troupe,

467
00:42:21,971 --> 00:42:23,767
though he doesn't have much
knowledge of music,

468
00:42:23,971 --> 00:42:25,938
any girl falls in love
with him easily,

469
00:42:26,138 --> 00:42:29,104
if you also fall for him, program will get
upset and your future will be ruined.

470
00:42:31,073 --> 00:42:35,597
Do you've this talent too?
- Is this a problem? Who is he?

471
00:42:35,974 --> 00:42:37,497
Look there! That's him!

472
00:42:39,074 --> 00:42:40,802
Next to the French bearded man.
That's him!

473
00:42:41,874 --> 00:42:43,602
He's a face reader and
tells the horoscope.

474
00:42:43,809 --> 00:42:46,832
You're shocked! Have you fallen
in love with him at first sight?

475
00:42:48,610 --> 00:42:50,099
I love music.

476
00:42:50,810 --> 00:42:52,037
I hate love.

477
00:42:52,644 --> 00:42:56,008
I don't want to be a singer,
good bye to you and your troupe.

478
00:42:56,744 --> 00:42:58,108
Please listen to me...

479
00:42:59,645 --> 00:43:00,440
Please...

480
00:43:02,479 --> 00:43:08,936
Thank you very much.

481
00:43:09,146 --> 00:43:10,942
How is it?
- Excellent buddy!

482
00:43:11,714 --> 00:43:13,772
We can happily practice now
without any disturbance.

483
00:43:13,982 --> 00:43:14,606
Let's do it.

484
00:43:18,082 --> 00:43:20,605
Get up! Getting late.
- What's this sister?

485
00:43:26,551 --> 00:43:27,676
Sister, your breakfast.

486
00:43:30,751 --> 00:43:32,047
Have you forgotten it?

487
00:43:34,152 --> 00:43:34,776
Go!

488
00:43:38,219 --> 00:43:39,776
Come fast, we are getting late.

489
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:44,544
Go... go...

490
00:43:55,823 --> 00:44:08,123
You... you... it's you...

491
00:44:11,159 --> 00:44:18,184
I feel everything in this world
is second to you...

492
00:44:18,661 --> 00:44:25,528
Whatever has happened it would've
happened because of you only...

493
00:44:25,762 --> 00:44:28,888
You appear before me,
where ever I'm going...

494
00:44:29,097 --> 00:44:32,723
You're moving me
though I'm alone...

495
00:44:32,931 --> 00:44:36,557
You're charming me,
whatever I'm thinking...

496
00:44:36,765 --> 00:44:39,959
You're making me happy,
though you're not before me...

497
00:45:44,612 --> 00:45:51,637
Happiness in a moment and
doubt in the next moment...

498
00:45:51,847 --> 00:45:55,644
Thinking about you only
in sleep also...

499
00:45:55,848 --> 00:45:59,144
It's always you in my eyes...

500
00:46:08,683 --> 00:46:14,640
I've gone mad thinking about you...
O my love...

501
00:47:27,166 --> 00:47:29,655
What? Program is cancelled?
Why?

502
00:47:29,867 --> 00:47:32,594
IT market is down and
sponsors have backed out.

503
00:47:32,933 --> 00:47:34,832
Those who brought tickets
want refund.

504
00:47:35,035 --> 00:47:37,160
It seems they can buy
a flat with ticket money.

505
00:47:38,802 --> 00:47:43,235
I pledged my wife's jewels for
the troupe's travel and stay.

506
00:47:43,603 --> 00:47:44,261
What am I to do now?

507
00:47:46,936 --> 00:47:48,835
Trusting Ramana Reddy
has cost me dearly.

508
00:47:50,038 --> 00:47:52,596
I forgot to ask you,
did you have food?

509
00:47:59,205 --> 00:48:01,069
Very nice!
- How long should I wait?

510
00:48:01,539 --> 00:48:03,005
Bloody, I'm waiting.

511
00:48:07,874 --> 00:48:09,773
You bloody idiots!

512
00:48:10,875 --> 00:48:13,603
Why did you spoil the mood?
The girl left.

513
00:48:13,809 --> 00:48:16,502
My foot! You're in trouble.
Program is cancelled.

514
00:48:16,709 --> 00:48:17,175
Cancelled?

515
00:48:17,543 --> 00:48:21,169
We are practicing day and night,
and you say it's cancelled.

516
00:48:22,077 --> 00:48:28,500
All out time is wasted.
- Pay us something and settle us.

517
00:48:28,879 --> 00:48:31,845
I'll not settle you,
infact you must pay me.

518
00:48:32,046 --> 00:48:33,603
Why?
- Why?

519
00:48:33,813 --> 00:48:37,836
To have fed you like pigs.
Who will pay for it?

520
00:48:39,614 --> 00:48:42,172
Sometimes our money goes drown
the drain, you mustn't mind it.

521
00:48:45,149 --> 00:48:50,844
Sometimes passports too get torn,
you mustn't bother about it.

522
00:48:51,883 --> 00:48:53,611
Where can we bring
so much money?

523
00:48:54,617 --> 00:48:59,676
You practiced day and night, right?
Sing on roads to earn.

524
00:49:01,085 --> 00:49:07,019
Whatever name you may give it,
return my money, take your passports.

525
00:49:07,219 --> 00:49:08,014
Okay?
- Okay.

526
00:49:08,219 --> 00:49:10,515
Till then stay here only.
- Thank God.

527
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:11,686
I didn't mean here.

528
00:49:12,888 --> 00:49:13,683
Where to?

529
00:49:15,322 --> 00:49:17,015
What happened, buddy?

530
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:19,686
Bloody!

531
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:40,526
Stop...

532
00:49:44,727 --> 00:49:48,125
Just now came to know there
are slums in Switzerland too.

533
00:49:48,561 --> 00:49:51,027
Couldn't they've made
'Slumdog Millionaire' here?

534
00:49:51,329 --> 00:49:53,852
Our lives weren't so bad
even in Hyderabad.

535
00:49:54,063 --> 00:49:59,519
He showed us hell, you must
show your power to him, buddy.

536
00:50:00,064 --> 00:50:01,792
Where is Butch Thomas?

537
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:16,027
What?

538
00:50:16,567 --> 00:50:18,033
It seems you threatened the
boys not to go to India.

539
00:50:18,901 --> 00:50:22,595
Yes, I did threaten them.
So what?

540
00:50:22,802 --> 00:50:24,700
We'll not go,
we'll stay back here only.

541
00:50:25,269 --> 00:50:28,202
Don't give our passports too.
We'll go after settling your dues.

542
00:50:29,170 --> 00:50:32,261
But please change the room.
It's very dirty.

543
00:50:33,904 --> 00:50:35,131
That's respect.

544
00:50:35,737 --> 00:50:36,203
What the hell did you do?

545
00:50:36,571 --> 00:50:40,026
You boasted with us and
then fell at his feet.

546
00:50:40,238 --> 00:50:42,033
You ruined our honour.
Do you've any sense?

547
00:50:42,739 --> 00:50:44,967
Why are you tensed?
Program is cancelled.

548
00:50:45,173 --> 00:50:48,038
That's all, isn't it?
I've managed to get a sponsor.

549
00:50:48,573 --> 00:50:51,540
Our show will go on.
- Really, buddy?

550
00:50:52,074 --> 00:50:53,700
Promise.
- Will it work out?

551
00:50:56,842 --> 00:50:59,206
Why will it not work out?
I've been trying for long.

552
00:50:59,675 --> 00:51:00,801
She'll accept.
- She'll accept?

553
00:51:01,009 --> 00:51:02,202
You mean a lady sponsor.

554
00:51:02,576 --> 00:51:04,042
Wait! Aren't there women sponsors?

555
00:51:04,643 --> 00:51:05,632
You carry on darling.

556
00:51:05,843 --> 00:51:09,208
I'll follow the sponsor
and work out.

557
00:51:09,811 --> 00:51:11,710
Till then be on the job of
settling Thomas' dues.

558
00:51:11,912 --> 00:51:16,868
Should we've beg for it?
- Why do you want my permission?

559
00:52:18,092 --> 00:52:19,718
You did a good thing today.

560
00:52:19,925 --> 00:52:22,119
I'm scared of you because
you know everything about me.

561
00:52:22,926 --> 00:52:24,722
Please don't follow
and torture me.

562
00:52:29,594 --> 00:52:33,049
My legs involuntarily walk
towards you only...

563
00:52:33,261 --> 00:52:36,887
I went silent because
of you only...

564
00:52:37,096 --> 00:52:40,596
I'm talking about you only
with everyone...

565
00:52:40,596 --> 00:52:44,222
I too have become like you only...

566
00:52:53,666 --> 00:52:57,224
Though everyone around is abusing,
I'll not listen to any of it...

568
00:53:56,412 --> 00:53:57,673
What do you want for your birthday?

569
00:54:00,946 --> 00:54:02,572
Wait for 5 minutes.

570
00:54:03,613 --> 00:54:06,079
I'll deliver this.
- Okay. Nani, come here.

571
00:54:25,684 --> 00:54:28,742
Why hasn't sister come back?
- She'll come. Don't worry.

572
00:54:29,284 --> 00:54:30,910
Sister... sister...

573
00:54:32,386 --> 00:54:33,317
Sister!

574
00:55:22,295 --> 00:55:22,920
What happened?

575
00:55:23,129 --> 00:55:25,755
Nani and Ritu are missing.
Did you see them?

576
00:55:26,196 --> 00:55:28,662
You know face reading, right?
Tell me where are they?

577
00:55:29,630 --> 00:55:32,256
That's him, today is his birthday.

578
00:55:34,132 --> 00:55:37,792
I told them to wait there only.

579
00:55:40,732 --> 00:55:42,164
Please Prabha, tell me.

580
00:59:16,277 --> 00:59:18,300
Don't laugh! What did you promise
and what have you done?

581
00:59:18,677 --> 00:59:20,973
You promised on your dad,
yet... cheated us.

582
00:59:22,077 --> 00:59:23,634
I'm still bound by the promise.

583
00:59:23,845 --> 00:59:26,970
Not only that girl, I would've
helped any girl in that position.

584
00:59:27,679 --> 00:59:30,304
Our fate! I think we'll never
go back to India.

585
00:59:30,946 --> 00:59:31,707
What the hell are you blabbering?

586
00:59:42,015 --> 00:59:43,072
What do you want me to do?

587
00:59:43,282 --> 00:59:44,646
You must come with us
from tomorrow.

588
01:00:12,954 --> 01:00:16,319
There's stamina to win in heart...

589
01:00:16,688 --> 01:00:20,144
There's a soft loving heart
in a corner...

590
01:00:21,023 --> 01:00:26,979
If he listens to our song
without missing a word...

591
01:00:28,090 --> 01:00:34,047
Jackson will come back
to earth from heaven...

592
01:01:03,364 --> 01:01:06,990
Song of heart is playing
out on guitar...

593

When struggle becomes your
companion, won't victory be yours?

595
01:01:24,869 --> 01:01:31,326
With your music,
let the chariot march ahead...

596
01:01:32,170 --> 01:01:38,105
You've love armoury

Which ever country it may,
our message is same...

598

Which ever stage it may be,
our dances are a celebration...

599
01:02:21,881 --> 01:02:28,940
Our songs are stream of thought
that flows between sky and earth...

600
01:02:29,149 --> 01:02:34,673
This is modern era where voices
of the poorjoined in chorus...

601
01:02:36,150 --> 01:02:40,174
This is the time when world
has seen it's power...

603
01:04:13,003 --> 01:04:13,469
What's this?

604
01:04:14,070 --> 01:04:15,696
Your passports and flight tickets.

605
01:04:15,904 --> 01:04:16,927
Go back to India immediately.

606
01:04:17,737 --> 01:04:19,704
Why all of a sudden?
What happened?

607
01:04:19,905 --> 01:04:21,030
Don't you know
what has happened?

608
01:04:21,239 --> 01:04:24,103
I had warned you on arrival.
Stay away from girls.

609
01:04:24,506 --> 01:04:25,802
You love Nandhini.

610
01:04:27,739 --> 01:04:28,966
Do you know who is Nandhini?

611
01:04:29,740 --> 01:04:31,206
Daughter of my friend
who is in Texas.

612
01:04:31,740 --> 01:04:35,298
He left her in my care
trusting me.

613
01:04:35,508 --> 01:04:39,202
If he comes to know about your love,
he'll kill me also along with you.

614
01:04:39,442 --> 01:04:41,874
That's why you leave
this place immediately.

615
01:04:44,810 --> 01:04:47,368
Come on... say you love me.

616
01:04:49,177 --> 01:04:51,041
Come on say it... say it...

617
01:04:53,911 --> 01:04:54,935
What are you saying sir?

618
01:04:55,145 --> 01:04:59,703
How can I love Nandhini?
She's a mad girl.

619
01:05:01,013 --> 01:05:03,104
Mad about music.
That's why she was after us.

620
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:07,311
Anyway we're here to make money.
Not to fall in love.

621
01:05:11,249 --> 01:05:12,976
You don't imagine things.

622
01:05:13,749 --> 01:05:15,874
Don't narrate tales to me.
Leave immediately.

623
01:05:16,083 --> 01:05:18,049
Please listen to me once.
Give us two days time.

624
01:05:19,083 --> 01:05:21,380
We'll leave after earning money.
We'll pay you also.

625
01:05:21,750 --> 01:05:23,876
I don't want money,
I want to save my life.

626
01:05:24,084 --> 01:05:26,710
Leave immediately.
- How can we if you say suddenly?

627
01:05:39,921 --> 01:05:42,387
You love Nandhini,
why were you so harsh on her?

628
01:05:42,755 --> 01:05:44,380
Didn't you make me promise
worse than that?

629
01:05:45,189 --> 01:05:48,212
Sorry, we got afraid of Buchi.
- And made me promise.

630
01:05:49,356 --> 01:05:50,879
He's just a comedian.

631
01:05:52,190 --> 01:05:52,713
You made me promise not
to say I love you to her,

632
01:05:53,757 --> 01:05:54,882
So I thought I would make
her say it.

633
01:05:56,024 --> 01:05:58,047
Nandhini loves me.

634
01:05:58,491 --> 01:06:00,117
I wanted her to express it first.

635
01:06:03,425 --> 01:06:06,789
If we have two days time,
Nandhini will say I love you any moment.

636
01:06:07,026 --> 01:06:08,890
That's why I was little harsh
about her with him.

637
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:10,726
Okay, what shall we do now?

638
01:06:11,427 --> 01:06:13,325
Whatelse can we do?
Let's go back to India.

639
01:06:13,528 --> 01:06:14,994
India?
If we wait for two days...

640
01:06:16,028 --> 01:06:16,721
Let's go.

641
01:06:29,464 --> 01:06:30,828
Prabha has come for you.

642
01:06:31,365 --> 01:06:32,228
Tell him I'm not here.

643
01:06:32,498 --> 01:06:34,396
He's going back to India.
- So what?

644
01:06:34,765 --> 01:06:35,992
Told you tell him I'm not here.

645
01:06:36,299 --> 01:06:39,823
He risked his life to save us,
why are you behaving like this?

646
01:06:40,066 --> 01:06:41,054
What happened to you?

647
01:06:47,201 --> 01:06:50,396
If he doesn't love me, why should
I let him know I love him?

648
01:06:54,369 --> 01:06:55,165
What's it?

649
01:07:01,004 --> 01:07:01,800
What?

650
01:07:03,437 --> 01:07:05,995
I want to tell you something.
- Go ahead.

651
01:07:06,205 --> 01:07:08,228
Why are you covering your face?

652
01:07:10,373 --> 01:07:14,136
You've done something wrong.
- Yes, I committed a mistake.

653
01:07:14,340 --> 01:07:15,965
But I don't owe any
explanation to you.

654
01:07:16,173 --> 01:07:17,298
You're going back to India, right?

655
01:07:37,111 --> 01:07:38,078
What is this?

656
01:07:41,045 --> 01:07:42,944
You love Prabha, right?

657
01:07:44,380 --> 01:07:45,505
Then, why don't you tell him?

658
01:07:47,380 --> 01:07:51,746
He said I'm mad.

659
01:08:01,449 --> 01:08:04,075
Did he say directly with you
that he doesn't love you?

660
01:08:05,950 --> 01:08:07,076
Think over it again.

661
01:08:07,284 --> 01:08:09,308
Prabha has come to you
before going back to India,

662
01:08:09,918 --> 01:08:11,908
he wouldn't come unless
it's very important, right?

663
01:08:12,885 --> 01:08:14,748
What if he had come to
express his love?

664
01:08:15,786 --> 01:08:16,911
Why don't you talk to him?

665
01:08:21,253 --> 01:08:25,243
I'm not able to talk to him after
knowing I'm not in his heart.

666
01:08:25,454 --> 01:08:27,920
You don't say anything,
just stand before him,

667
01:08:28,122 --> 01:08:29,247
he knows face reading, right?

668
01:08:29,955 --> 01:08:32,421
He may start loving you after
knowing about your love for him.

669
01:08:33,522 --> 01:08:38,922
Go, if you miss him now,
you may not get him again in life. Go!

670
01:08:58,395 --> 01:09:01,486
You wanted to say something,
what's that?

671
01:09:08,397 --> 01:09:10,989
That is... how am I to tell you?

672
01:09:11,196 --> 01:09:12,254
No problem, tell me.

673
01:09:23,133 --> 01:09:24,099
Tell me.
- I don't... l...

674
01:09:27,533 --> 01:09:30,432
Come on tell me.
- I don't know face reading.

675
01:10:06,575 --> 01:10:10,099
This is a gift by a girl who loves me
without really knowing me,

676
01:10:14,977 --> 01:10:16,772
I don't know if she loves me or not,

677
01:10:17,544 --> 01:10:19,874
I don't want to keep it with me
without knowing that,

678
01:10:20,210 --> 01:10:23,109
you're a good girl,
keep this gift with you.

679
01:10:23,478 --> 01:10:26,376
If you love anyone in future,
you can give it to him.

680
01:10:31,147 --> 01:10:35,273
Take it Nandhini, if it's with you,
I'll take it as she loves me.

681
01:10:47,983 --> 01:10:50,143
If you love someone else,
why should I take this gift?

682
01:10:50,350 --> 01:10:52,510
Go to hell!

683
01:11:29,158 --> 01:11:30,284
Stop!

684
01:11:43,161 --> 01:11:44,184
Nothing will happen to you.

685
01:12:32,171 --> 01:12:32,967
Why are you crying?

686
01:12:33,838 --> 01:12:37,293
It seems Nandhini has
sank into coma.

687
01:13:16,513 --> 01:13:17,570
What happened then?

688
01:13:21,915 --> 01:13:25,473
She'll come...
My Nandhini will come for me.

689
01:13:26,949 --> 01:13:31,143
She'll come, your Nandhini will
definitely come for you.

690
01:13:32,850 --> 01:13:35,544
I'll manage my daughter.

691
01:13:39,851 --> 01:13:40,317
Go!

692
01:13:57,521 --> 01:13:59,919
It's true you love Nandhini
from young age,

693
01:14:00,189 --> 01:14:01,951
it's true,
she lives in Switzerland,

694
01:14:02,156 --> 01:14:06,145
it's true you've downloaded
Nandhini's photos from Internet,

695
01:14:07,423 --> 01:14:09,912
but when did we go
to Switzerland?

696
01:14:12,025 --> 01:14:13,218
What's all this cooked up story?

697
01:14:15,025 --> 01:14:15,923
What could I do?

698
01:14:16,125 --> 01:14:19,559
He was pointing a gun on your head
and insisting I marry his daughter,

699
01:14:20,360 --> 01:14:21,326
you know one thing,

700
01:14:21,627 --> 01:14:24,492
I'm going to meet Nandhini tomorrow
for the first time after 15 years.

701
01:14:25,527 --> 01:14:27,322
She'll be in India for 10 days only.

702
01:14:27,928 --> 01:14:28,985
Should we need violence now?

703
01:14:29,362 --> 01:14:30,328
That's why I cooked up
a story for him.

704
01:14:32,029 --> 01:14:34,154
You cooked up
a brilliant story extempore.

705
01:14:35,029 --> 01:14:40,827
I didn't cook anything, I just told him
my love for Nandhini in words.

706
01:14:48,865 --> 01:14:51,331
Our real love story starts
from tomorrow.

707
01:15:04,469 --> 01:15:05,594
Uncle Butchaiah!

708
01:15:08,103 --> 01:15:10,399
Oh! You made Butchaiah
as Butch Thomas.

709
01:15:10,603 --> 01:15:13,161
Uncle... uncle...
- It's unbelievable, buddy.

710
01:15:13,371 --> 01:15:14,837
It looks exactly like your
story opening scene.

711
01:15:15,037 --> 01:15:16,503
It was airport but
railway station here.

712
01:15:16,871 --> 01:15:18,497
That's all.
- Greetings... - Uncle!

713
01:15:21,039 --> 01:15:22,164
Are they your friends?
- Yes...

714
01:15:22,373 --> 01:15:23,498
Did you all have food?

715
01:15:24,473 --> 01:15:26,496
Same character,
only backdrop has changed.

716
01:15:26,873 --> 01:15:27,839
What's he saying about backdrop?

717
01:15:28,040 --> 01:15:29,506
Let's discuss later,
let's go home first.

718
01:15:29,874 --> 01:15:31,840
Come and have food.
- You must eat well.

719
01:15:32,041 --> 01:15:36,997
Everyone has come?
- All have come, it's fun and frolic.

720
01:15:40,643 --> 01:15:44,235
All have come except Viswam's
daughter Nandhini from Switzerland.

721
01:16:05,447 --> 01:16:09,005
Daddy, enough of offering prayers,
there's lot of work to do.

722
01:16:09,215 --> 01:16:13,171
This is our ancestral property,
let me offer prayers peacefully.

723
01:16:15,050 --> 01:16:16,879
Children! Have you had food?
- No, we'll have it later.

724
01:16:17,083 --> 01:16:19,948
I'll kill you kids...
skipping lunch in the game.

725
01:16:20,151 --> 01:16:21,878
Stock over?

726
01:16:22,084 --> 01:16:24,915
Fill the empty bottles with
cheap liquor and sell it.

727
01:16:25,119 --> 01:16:28,517
People only see labels
not the stock inside.

728
01:16:28,886 --> 01:16:31,511
He was church father in your story
but he's a wine shop owner in real.

729
01:16:31,886 --> 01:16:33,182
Isn't his character different?

730
01:16:33,387 --> 01:16:35,945
Buddy, it's fun and
festivities all over the home.

731
01:16:36,154 --> 01:16:38,120
But I feel like I'm in a cemetery.

732
01:16:39,955 --> 01:16:41,114
We don't have anything here,
let's go back to Hyderabad.

733
01:16:41,322 --> 01:16:43,914
No, how can we leave
to Hyderabad immediately...

734
01:16:49,024 --> 01:16:50,887
My sister calls me James Bond.

735
01:16:51,090 --> 01:16:53,181
All others call me Firebrand.

736
01:16:54,891 --> 01:16:56,084
Your Swiss brother-in-law?

737
01:16:57,291 --> 01:16:58,188
He's also here.

738
01:16:58,392 --> 01:17:00,188
Shall we play cricket?

739
01:17:00,392 --> 01:17:02,621
Get lost half ticket.

740
01:17:04,893 --> 01:17:06,416
Why are you all dull?

741
01:17:07,127 --> 01:17:08,593
Problem?
Why did we all came here?

742
01:17:08,961 --> 01:17:14,088
Look at his face! You've come alone
without your sister...

743
01:17:14,962 --> 01:17:16,360
Why is he saying sister?

744
01:17:16,562 --> 01:17:19,187
Not sister he's saying mister.

745
01:17:19,396 --> 01:17:21,260
I'll tell him.

746
01:17:22,664 --> 01:17:25,153
Why are they saying sister?

747
01:17:25,364 --> 01:17:27,091
Trying to flatter sister.

748
01:17:27,964 --> 01:17:29,931
Am I a half ticket?

749
01:17:34,632 --> 01:17:35,598
Your son?

750
01:17:37,199 --> 01:17:38,256
Did you recognise him?

751
01:17:38,900 --> 01:17:42,264
Your childhood dance partner
Nandhini's dad.

752
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:44,632
Why didn't you tell us about
his character in your story?

753
01:17:45,001 --> 01:17:47,365
He hates me from my childhood,
that's why censored.

754
01:17:48,201 --> 01:17:50,599
There wasn't a villain in story
but we have one here.

755
01:17:51,636 --> 01:17:55,864
He was a dull student, he failed
seventh class twice or thrice...

756
01:17:56,070 --> 01:17:58,593
That was then.
Now a brilliant student.

757
01:18:02,271 --> 01:18:04,931
Am I a brilliant student?
- Just to build image.

758
01:18:05,571 --> 01:18:09,164
Children want a swing,
go to the next town and get it.

759
01:18:09,372 --> 01:18:12,339
Do I look like a porter?
- People may over hear you.

760
01:18:12,540 --> 01:18:16,973
It's all out family, it's not wrong
to do our work ourselves.

761
01:18:17,174 --> 01:18:18,868
I can't do it father,
I'm going back to Hyderabad.

762
01:18:19,075 --> 01:18:20,041
Find someone else to do it.

763
01:18:20,242 --> 01:18:21,367
Why are you leaving suddenly?

764
01:18:21,575 --> 01:18:23,438
Why a gang is going for a swing?
Just one man is enough.

765
01:18:23,642 --> 01:18:26,108
He's not going to get a swing,
he's going back to Hyderabad.

766
01:18:26,909 --> 01:18:27,603
We are meeting after 10 years,

767
01:18:27,977 --> 01:18:30,341
you must enjoy it,
why are you leaving now?

768
01:18:30,544 --> 01:18:33,203
You enjoy it,
just out of your college,

769
01:18:33,411 --> 01:18:35,207
youth, have a blast.
We'll go.

770
01:18:35,412 --> 01:18:39,277
We are here to refresh.

771
01:18:39,578 --> 01:18:41,602
You refresh yourselves,
we are leaving.

772
01:18:43,446 --> 01:18:45,345
Why are you leaving now?
Your uncle wants you to stay here.

773
01:18:45,547 --> 01:18:47,206
Friend's marriage,
I must go, father.

774
01:18:47,447 --> 01:18:50,005
If not this marriage, you can meet
your friends in another marriage.

775
01:18:50,214 --> 01:18:52,237
We are meeting once in
5 or 10 years only,

776
01:18:52,448 --> 01:18:54,914
why do you want to leave now?

777
01:18:55,115 --> 01:18:56,581
What's that for?

778
01:18:56,949 --> 01:18:57,880
Okay, go.

779
01:18:58,482 --> 01:18:59,539
Come on boys.

780
01:19:00,316 --> 01:19:02,043
Bad luck boy.

781
01:19:02,250 --> 01:19:04,149
What's that code language?

782
01:19:04,351 --> 01:19:06,613
It means he's fixed.

783
01:19:09,285 --> 01:19:12,047
Gate closed here too.
Your story was indeed great.

784
01:19:12,252 --> 01:19:13,980
But Nandhini didn't turn up.

785
01:19:14,353 --> 01:19:19,684
If Nisha's father comes to know
this is fake story, he'll kill us.

786
01:19:20,120 --> 01:19:23,281
He's sad and you're adding to
his woes by telling about him.

787
01:19:24,021 --> 01:19:25,544
What if we go to
Switzerland for Nandhini?

788
01:19:33,390 --> 01:19:36,447
Look there! Everyone is following
line and he's trying to overtake.

789
01:19:47,325 --> 01:19:48,223
Do you've sense?

790
01:19:48,459 --> 01:19:49,551
Who gave you license?

791
01:19:49,926 --> 01:19:51,085
All are coming in line,
are you special?

792
01:19:51,293 --> 01:19:52,884
I'll beat you, go back.

793
01:20:08,563 --> 01:20:10,029
I told him to overtake.

794
01:20:10,230 --> 01:20:12,389
What sorry?
You look educated.

795
01:20:12,597 --> 01:20:13,654
Can't you use common sense?

796
01:20:14,031 --> 01:20:14,962
I'll talk to her.

797
01:20:15,165 --> 01:20:17,098
How many have to tell you?

798
01:20:17,299 --> 01:20:18,889
Arrogance of money?
Remove your car.

799
01:20:19,099 --> 01:20:21,691
Atleast you tell those
filthy rich people.

800
01:20:22,067 --> 01:20:25,227
Madam, please leave it.
I'll talk to her.

801
01:20:29,034 --> 01:20:30,694
Please listen...
- You stop it.

802
01:20:31,069 --> 01:20:31,966
Sister, come.

803
01:20:32,169 --> 01:20:33,294
Are you inside only?

804
01:20:36,469 --> 01:20:40,562
You go... go... l'll talk to them.

805
01:20:56,074 --> 01:20:58,336
Are you a traffic policeman?

806
01:21:00,107 --> 01:21:03,131
What bothers you
if the car overtakes?

807
01:21:06,675 --> 01:21:09,141
Unnecessarily you made
my darling abused in public.

808
01:21:10,009 --> 01:21:10,976
Why?

809
01:21:12,110 --> 01:21:15,201
You knew about your darling's arrival
because of this trouble, right?

810
01:21:15,410 --> 01:21:18,468
Had wee been to Hyderabad silently,
we wouldn't have know it?

811
01:21:23,212 --> 01:21:24,405
Thank God saved.

812
01:21:26,446 --> 01:21:27,912
Please do something.

813
01:21:30,947 --> 01:21:32,913
Father!
- What happened son?

814
01:21:33,114 --> 01:21:35,047
Marriage is stopped.
- Why?

815
01:21:35,247 --> 01:21:36,145
Why?

816
01:21:37,582 --> 01:21:38,605
Bride is dead, dad.

817
01:21:38,981 --> 01:21:40,572
You've to tell another story
why she died,

818
01:21:40,949 --> 01:21:42,006
say her mother is dead.

819
01:21:42,216 --> 01:21:44,011
Bride's mother, father.
- How?

820
01:21:45,450 --> 01:21:47,246
Why are you crying for her?

821
01:21:47,451 --> 01:21:50,145
Feel fatherafeel, please don't
ask me questions, father.

822
01:21:51,251 --> 01:21:52,978
Okay, you go home.

823
01:21:53,218 --> 01:21:56,344
Okay father, have good time
with your friends.

824
01:21:56,552 --> 01:21:57,644
I'll go home.

825
01:22:03,220 --> 01:22:04,516
What's your confusion, son?

826
01:22:04,721 --> 01:22:06,153
Would you like to come back here?

827
01:22:06,354 --> 01:22:08,479
You're fixed mentally that I'm gone.

828
01:22:08,722 --> 01:22:11,586
It won't be nice if I return.
- I'm telling you come back.

829
01:22:11,955 --> 01:22:12,921
Okay dad.

830
01:22:14,422 --> 01:22:16,116
Come.
- Where to?

831
01:22:16,323 --> 01:22:19,312
We are in Hyderabad now,
must reach tomorrow morning only.

832
01:22:30,459 --> 01:22:32,050
Stop boy!
- Uncle Butchaiah.

833
01:22:32,259 --> 01:22:35,226
My foot! You left after talking big.

834
01:22:35,426 --> 01:22:37,586
Why did you come back shamelessly?

835
01:22:37,960 --> 01:22:39,586
It's a long tale.
- Tell me.

836
01:22:39,961 --> 01:22:41,984
You'll get bored to repeat again.
- Say it interestingly.

837
01:22:42,195 --> 01:22:46,060
Bride's mother is dead!

838
01:22:46,262 --> 01:22:50,218
Marriage canopy turned
into a mourning place!

839
01:22:50,429 --> 01:22:53,157
Don't miss it.
- Stop your ads.

840
01:22:53,630 --> 01:22:55,493
You wanted to say
it interestingly.

841
01:22:56,198 --> 01:22:59,687
You should stay back and
console the bereaved family,

842
01:23:00,065 --> 01:23:00,996
why did you come back immediately?

843
01:23:01,199 --> 01:23:04,222
They are mourning and we didn't
want to be a burden to them.

844
01:23:04,432 --> 01:23:06,262
Are you friends?
Do you know what is friendship?

845
01:23:06,467 --> 01:23:09,262
Did you have food?
- Asked it perfectly for the first time.

846
01:23:09,467 --> 01:23:11,661
We are hungry.
- Come...

847
01:23:13,034 --> 01:23:14,728
Where's everyone?
I don't see anyone here.

848
01:23:17,569 --> 01:23:20,331
This temple is very famous.
- Is it uncle?

849
01:23:35,972 --> 01:23:39,530
Uncle! Who is he?
He didn't respond to your greeting.

850
01:23:41,407 --> 01:23:42,703
He's his father.

851
01:23:43,273 --> 01:23:44,262
What are you saying?

852
01:23:44,474 --> 01:23:48,430
Yes, I lost my parents
when I was a kid,

853
01:23:49,541 --> 01:23:52,167
I and Viswa were friends,

854
01:23:52,476 --> 01:23:56,534
his father took care of me
like his own son,

855
01:23:56,744 --> 01:24:01,006
Viswa's father fixed
a marriage for him,

856
01:24:01,211 --> 01:24:04,507
Viswa told me a day before
marriage about his love,

857
01:24:05,145 --> 01:24:06,372
and his father will not accept it,

858
01:24:07,579 --> 01:24:12,706
I arranged his marriage
with his lover overnight,

859
01:24:14,180 --> 01:24:18,943
unable to bear this shock
Viswa's mother died,

860
01:24:19,148 --> 01:24:23,513
ever since then he hates me,
he's angry on his son.

861
01:24:28,282 --> 01:24:30,272
What are you searching?
- For you only... for you only...

862
01:24:30,484 --> 01:24:31,211
Really?

863
01:24:31,484 --> 01:24:32,279
Cut...

864
01:24:36,084 --> 01:24:37,050
Your shirt is great.

865
01:24:37,251 --> 01:24:39,717
This is the worst shirt I have.

866
01:24:40,285 --> 01:24:42,308
Okay... shall we play cricket?

867
01:24:42,519 --> 01:24:45,350
I'm half ticket, I don't play
with black tickets.

868
01:24:45,986 --> 01:24:48,078
What the hell you're talking
without respecting elders?

869
01:24:48,287 --> 01:24:51,082
He risked his life to save you
from kidnappers.

870
01:24:51,287 --> 01:24:53,446
When?
- In first half.

871
01:24:56,055 --> 01:24:57,544
Bond, you may go.

872
01:25:01,990 --> 01:25:03,615
Nandhini is watching T20 match
in the penthouse,

873
01:25:03,990 --> 01:25:05,149
I don't think she'll come out now.

874
01:25:05,357 --> 01:25:06,687
She's mad about cricket.

875
01:25:07,058 --> 01:25:09,286
Did she come all the way here
to watch cricket?

876
01:25:09,492 --> 01:25:10,116
If she stays upstairs,
what will be my position?

877
01:25:10,991 --> 01:25:11,958
Buddy, please do something.

878
01:25:12,158 --> 01:25:14,182
Okay, you want her to
come out, right?

879
01:25:14,392 --> 01:25:16,551
If you cut the cable wire,
she'll come out.

880
01:25:17,292 --> 01:25:19,452
Chance of watching it on Internet.

881
01:25:20,993 --> 01:25:21,755
No use in biting nails.

882
01:25:22,128 --> 01:25:23,650
I think better to go up
climbing the pipe.

883
01:25:24,027 --> 01:25:27,188
You're great buddy!
Go up!

884
01:25:27,394 --> 01:25:28,292
Should I?

885
01:25:28,495 --> 01:25:30,257
You're the hero in story
and we should take risk in live?

886
01:25:30,462 --> 01:25:31,689
No way, you go.

887
01:25:38,730 --> 01:25:39,628
Do I've to buddy?

888
01:25:42,065 --> 01:25:43,621
Buddy, I'm climbing.
- Go ahead.

889
01:25:47,099 --> 01:25:49,565
Did you ask about store room
on arrival? Is it for this?

890
01:25:49,767 --> 01:25:52,562
I brought 20 cases of liquor,
where should I store it?

891
01:25:52,767 --> 01:25:55,393
They are having a blast,
but my position is...

892
01:25:55,601 --> 01:25:56,464
Okay, enjoy it.

893
01:26:15,404 --> 01:26:16,529
Watch now!

894
01:26:18,005 --> 01:26:20,198
Did you've food, Prabha?
- I had, uncle.

895
01:26:20,405 --> 01:26:23,338
I had, uncle.

896
01:26:23,540 --> 01:26:25,699
Did you eat? Then okay.

897
01:27:39,622 --> 01:27:42,180
Are you having drinks, uncle?
What's this uncle?

898
01:27:42,389 --> 01:27:43,650
This is our fate.

899
01:27:44,489 --> 01:27:47,479
I got it, all are drunk.

900
01:27:51,024 --> 01:27:53,990
How come TV is running here
and not in my room?

901
01:27:54,191 --> 01:27:55,987
That is also fate.

902
01:27:56,591 --> 01:27:57,717
Not fate...

903
01:27:59,292 --> 01:28:00,485
Come here.

904
01:28:05,827 --> 01:28:06,554
Come.

905
01:28:12,796 --> 01:28:16,160
I thought of you while cutting
cable wire to Nandhini's room.

906
01:28:16,363 --> 01:28:18,795
Dad, please don't ruin my life.

907
01:28:19,163 --> 01:28:23,654
You used to cut cable wire if you didn't
like your mother watching soaps.

908
01:28:24,031 --> 01:28:25,724
Please don't say anything, dad.

909
01:28:27,498 --> 01:28:28,429
Will you please come out
for a moment?

910
01:28:28,632 --> 01:28:30,723
Go and talk to her.
- Father.

911
01:28:35,633 --> 01:28:38,191
I've been watching you since
I came, you're torturing me.

912
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:39,559
Why did you cut the cable wire?

913
01:28:41,334 --> 01:28:42,732
Who told you I cut the wire?

914
01:28:43,802 --> 01:28:45,563
You were standing there
little while ago, right?

915
01:28:45,768 --> 01:28:48,064
Crow was also there,
crow could've done it.

916
01:28:49,302 --> 01:28:50,064
What am I blabbering?

917
01:28:50,270 --> 01:28:52,395
You were behaving over
when I came out.

918
01:28:52,603 --> 01:28:53,660
It means you'd have cut it.

919
01:28:54,037 --> 01:28:55,230
Me? Cutting it?

920
01:28:55,603 --> 01:28:57,263
I'll never behave so cheaply.

921
01:28:57,471 --> 01:28:59,664
Look, how cheap he's behaving.

922
01:29:00,038 --> 01:29:00,731
It's waste to talk to you.

923
01:29:01,105 --> 01:29:03,697
Don't ever try to cross
my path again.

924
01:29:06,273 --> 01:29:09,104
Father! Why?

925
01:29:17,708 --> 01:29:20,334
Look, how proud!
Very arrogant!

926
01:29:20,543 --> 01:29:22,441
Any little brother with
a beautiful sister will be.

927
01:29:28,044 --> 01:29:28,737
Uncle!

928
01:29:29,410 --> 01:29:32,104
Did you have food?
- I had.

929
01:29:32,311 --> 01:29:33,572
Bond did eat.
- Didn't eat?

930
01:29:34,112 --> 01:29:37,010
Why are you playing
without having food?

931
01:29:37,212 --> 01:29:41,509
Uncle, I swear I ate.
- No, you must eat now.

932
01:29:41,713 --> 01:29:43,576
Eat well and then play.

933
01:29:45,114 --> 01:29:46,808
This revenge is okay,
what about your love?

934
01:29:47,181 --> 01:29:48,579
Days are passing quickly.

935
01:29:49,581 --> 01:29:51,241
Just 8 more days.

936
01:29:51,515 --> 01:29:53,004
Watch out, I'll flatter her in 5 days.

937
01:29:53,215 --> 01:29:55,011
Impossible... you must come.

938
01:29:55,216 --> 01:29:56,182
You're coming, that's all.

939
01:29:57,049 --> 01:29:58,208
Who is it?
- My son.

940
01:29:58,416 --> 01:30:00,576
He finished studies in Australia
and now training in Vizag,

941
01:30:00,783 --> 01:30:02,682
I told him to come here,
he says no time to come.

942
01:30:03,051 --> 01:30:03,675
Give me the phone.

943
01:30:06,151 --> 01:30:08,344
Why are you refusing to come?
Ask him to come.

944
01:30:09,052 --> 01:30:10,075
I'm Viswa uncle.

945
01:30:10,486 --> 01:30:11,611
The same uncle.

946
01:30:12,152 --> 01:30:14,210
Rishi, I like you very much,

947
01:30:14,420 --> 01:30:18,080
because none of my friend's children
is as educated as you.

948
01:30:20,621 --> 01:30:21,780
You know Nandhini. Right?

949
01:30:23,321 --> 01:30:26,288
She won a gold medal in
London Cambridge University.

950
01:30:27,389 --> 01:30:29,356
She's a gold medalist and
you made her a chocolate thief.

951
01:30:29,557 --> 01:30:32,751
To enhance my character
I downgraded her character.

952
01:30:33,124 --> 01:30:34,215
Do you've to downgrade so much?

953
01:30:34,424 --> 01:30:35,583
You can come, can't you?

954
01:30:38,457 --> 01:30:41,322
Appala Naidu's son Rishi,
studied in Australia,

955
01:30:41,525 --> 01:30:43,787
he's presently training in Vizag
but refusing to come here.

956
01:30:44,159 --> 01:30:45,250
You please ask him to come.

957
01:31:03,063 --> 01:31:04,086
I won't take a no.

958
01:31:04,796 --> 01:31:07,025
I'm terribly bored here.

959
01:31:08,463 --> 01:31:09,793
You must come without fail.

960
01:31:24,100 --> 01:31:25,794
I think Nandhini is teasing you.

961
01:31:26,167 --> 01:31:28,157
She's already angry on me
and who is this Rishi?

962
01:31:28,368 --> 01:31:29,595
I'll tell you, give me a cigarette.

963
01:31:35,736 --> 01:31:38,498
I know why you're jealous,
why are you getting tensed?

964
01:31:38,703 --> 01:31:40,192
The new arrival's name is Rishi,

965
01:31:40,404 --> 01:31:42,597
name is very stylish,
but whose son he is?

966
01:31:43,838 --> 01:31:45,634
Would Appy have a son
like Hrithik Roshan?

967
01:31:45,839 --> 01:31:47,361
He'll be like Appy only!

968
01:31:50,272 --> 01:31:51,670
Sorry buddies!

969
01:31:51,873 --> 01:31:53,771
That's your bad habit.

970
01:31:54,140 --> 01:31:54,834
My sister loves Switzerland,

971
01:31:55,207 --> 01:31:58,799
if anyone talks about Swiss,
she'll get charmed.

972
01:31:59,174 --> 01:32:03,437
If anyone talks about India
or Andhra, she'll get angry.

973
01:32:04,242 --> 01:32:04,708
Stop.

974
01:32:05,075 --> 01:32:05,598
What is he man?

975
01:32:05,809 --> 01:32:08,775
I had great thoughts about Nandhini,
but he says something else.

976
01:32:09,410 --> 01:32:12,377
Unwittingly this boy has
given us the full information.

977
01:32:12,577 --> 01:32:14,510
You must praise Swiss
so that Nandhini overhears it.

978
01:32:14,711 --> 01:32:16,370
Me?
- Can't avoid it.

979
01:32:16,578 --> 01:32:17,703
We don't have much time.

980
01:32:18,078 --> 01:32:19,169
Impressing her is more important.

981
01:32:19,378 --> 01:32:21,708
You prepare the speech,
we'll arrange the gang.

982
01:32:22,079 --> 01:32:22,772
Come on boys.

983
01:32:24,313 --> 01:32:27,439
Those black tickets think
I'm a half ticket.

984
01:32:27,646 --> 01:32:30,807
My sister hates Switzerland.

985
01:32:37,416 --> 01:32:39,439
Do you know how beautiful
Switzerland is!

986
01:32:40,416 --> 01:32:43,281
Even offices here not as neat
as the roads there.

987
01:32:43,483 --> 01:32:48,348
Here only an AC will cool the rooms,
but there entire country is cool.

988
01:32:48,551 --> 01:32:51,745
Roads, houses and
rooms are congested here,

989
01:32:52,118 --> 01:32:54,550
but in Swiss, broad roads,
big houses,

990
01:32:54,752 --> 01:32:56,809
what do we have here
that's comfortable?

991
01:32:57,186 --> 01:32:59,311
If I've another life,
I would like to be born in Swiss.

992
01:33:01,254 --> 01:33:02,345
Flow is correct, right?

993
01:33:02,554 --> 01:33:04,486
What do you know about
India to say like this?

994
01:33:05,254 --> 01:33:07,153
What's here to live comfortably?

995
01:33:07,355 --> 01:33:09,287
There's love between humans here.

996
01:33:09,488 --> 01:33:14,547
That's enough to live the life happily
till end without any riches.

997
01:33:16,090 --> 01:33:19,113
Though homes are congested,
people don't feel it.

998
01:33:19,324 --> 01:33:21,449
They feel they are living closer.

999
01:33:22,491 --> 01:33:26,288
Though not related they sacrifice
for other's sake.

1000
01:33:26,491 --> 01:33:30,481
Though blood related there,
nobody cares for their own also.

1001
01:33:30,693 --> 01:33:33,819
I understood what I missed till now
after coming here.

1002
01:33:35,228 --> 01:33:40,127
The love and affection showered
on us in these few days,

1003
01:33:40,328 --> 01:33:43,295
I feel like being born again
and again here only.

1004
01:33:47,330 --> 01:34:06,327
~ Digital Desi Releasers ~

1005
01:34:07,434 --> 01:34:17,563
Why? Why do you take so much
time to tell your choice?

1006
01:34:17,769 --> 01:34:22,725
Don't handcuff me...

1007
01:34:23,103 --> 01:34:28,059
I must make it to your
heart today...

1008
01:34:28,271 --> 01:34:40,571
Please listen to my heart...
Don't hide your feelings...

1009
01:34:40,773 --> 01:34:48,731
Seen you as a woman of substance,
don't mask yourself with silence...

1010
01:34:49,442 --> 01:34:54,069
Come... come... running,
O my dear...

1011
01:34:54,376 --> 01:34:59,242
Take chances and risk
without any more fear...

1012
01:35:31,618 --> 01:35:36,074
Growing amidst clouds...

1013
01:35:36,785 --> 01:35:41,081
Is that why moon spreads
cool moonlight?

1014
01:35:41,286 --> 01:35:51,415
We blossomed amidst thorns...
Even my petals will hurt you...

1015
01:35:51,622 --> 01:35:56,578
Shore may change but
not the attitude...

1016
01:35:56,789 --> 01:36:02,154
Our lives will never change...

1017
01:36:52,500 --> 01:36:56,661
Express it and then go...

1018
01:36:57,635 --> 01:37:02,092
It's not love if you hide it
in your heart...

1019
01:37:02,302 --> 01:37:07,259
It's not sin to share nectar of love...

1020
01:37:07,470 --> 01:37:12,268
Bliss of love is never a burden...

1021
01:37:12,471 --> 01:37:22,839
Won't your beauty make
an open invitation?

1022
01:38:02,781 --> 01:38:05,270
Nandhini said she hates you,
why are you still here?

1023
01:38:05,482 --> 01:38:06,607
Let's go back to Hyderabad.

1024
01:38:08,882 --> 01:38:10,109
Now I've real hope.

1025
01:38:10,349 --> 01:38:12,713
Nandhini is just like
I had imagined.

1026
01:38:13,484 --> 01:38:17,383
Watch out now,
how easily I'll flatter her.

1027
01:38:17,584 --> 01:38:18,778
Impossible.
- Who is that?

1028
01:38:19,585 --> 01:38:23,450
My sister never plays shuttle.
She loves basketball. You know?

1029
01:38:24,319 --> 01:38:24,785
No.

1030
01:38:26,653 --> 01:38:27,449
To hell with you.

1031
01:38:27,653 --> 01:38:29,620
Who cares if your sister
likes basketball or not,

1032
01:38:29,820 --> 01:38:30,615
are you giving misinformation,

1033
01:38:30,820 --> 01:38:33,116
like fools if we get
a basketball court ready,

1034
01:38:33,321 --> 01:38:35,116
are you planning to play there?

1035
01:38:35,488 --> 01:38:39,114
Get lost! Why are you staring?
Go away!

1036
01:38:42,656 --> 01:38:43,782
Why are you laughing?

1037
01:38:44,156 --> 01:38:47,612
Those front benchers think
I'm a half ticket.

1038
01:38:48,157 --> 01:38:51,181
My sister loves basketball.

1039
01:38:56,159 --> 01:38:58,523
Get ready a basketball ground.

1040
01:38:58,726 --> 01:39:01,453
To hell with that kid,
he's giving misinformation.

1041
01:39:01,660 --> 01:39:05,525
He's too smart kid.
Basketball is correct.

1042
01:39:08,295 --> 01:39:09,522
Where are you going?

1043
01:39:09,728 --> 01:39:11,126
They are playing basket ball there.

1044
01:39:12,162 --> 01:39:13,185
I'm going to watch it.

1045
01:39:24,164 --> 01:39:26,131
Your plan has worked out.

1046
01:39:31,565 --> 01:39:32,293
Appy's boy!

1047
01:41:31,424 --> 01:41:33,152
Are you such a good
basketball player?

1048
01:41:45,393 --> 01:41:47,359
Would Appy have a son
like Hrithik Roshan?

1049
01:41:47,560 --> 01:41:48,685
He'll be like Appy only!

1050
01:41:54,962 --> 01:41:56,758
Had food kids?

1051
01:41:56,963 --> 01:42:00,327
Uncle, don't turn me into a killer.
- What's he blabbering?

1052
01:42:00,596 --> 01:42:01,653
Would anyone become
a killer by eating food?

1053
01:42:01,863 --> 01:42:03,829
Why are you torturing us, uncle?

1054
01:42:04,197 --> 01:42:06,561
Would we die if we skip a meal?
Don't anyone bother about us?

1055
01:42:06,764 --> 01:42:12,664
Rishi may be tall and
handsome, so what...

1056
01:42:13,199 --> 01:42:14,495
What happened to him suddenly?

1057
01:42:14,699 --> 01:42:16,666
He'll be normal after eating.
- Then come with me.

1058
01:42:16,866 --> 01:42:19,764
If you don't eat you'll have problems,
that's why I always ask, had food?

1059
01:42:29,703 --> 01:42:33,227
Rishi is a good in martial arts
too as in studies.

1060
01:42:33,669 --> 01:42:36,329
He'll now break this ice bar.

1061
01:43:07,543 --> 01:43:11,738
See, how Nandhini is impressed.
You too break the ice bar.

1062
01:43:12,378 --> 01:43:14,503
It's martial art,
you must break it with technique,

1063
01:43:14,712 --> 01:43:16,678
if not it'll break your hand.

1064
01:43:16,878 --> 01:43:18,344
You're not talking like a hero.

1065
01:43:18,745 --> 01:43:21,268
Hero isn'tjust brawn,
he needs brain too.

1066
01:43:27,947 --> 01:43:30,345
He's wantonly targetting you, buddy.

1067
01:43:51,219 --> 01:43:53,844
Breaking ice again is bore.

1068
01:43:54,219 --> 01:43:56,186
Why would he use the same?
I've ordered for another one.

1069
01:43:56,386 --> 01:43:57,353
Bring it boys.

1070
01:44:00,387 --> 01:44:00,944
Come son.

1071
01:44:01,587 --> 01:44:03,577
Father, you wait.
- What's this uncle?

1072
01:44:05,455 --> 01:44:07,785
If he too tries, we'll know
who has more strength.

1073
01:44:08,556 --> 01:44:13,251
Strength is not something to exhibit,
it'll come out when it's necessary.

1074
01:44:13,457 --> 01:44:15,514
You come son.
- Father, you move aside.

1075
01:44:16,724 --> 01:44:18,350
Start the music, Bunty, you dance.

1076
01:44:18,558 --> 01:44:20,183
Father, I must break it today.

1077
01:44:20,725 --> 01:44:23,556
Come... come... son.
I'm telling you.

1078
01:44:29,560 --> 01:44:30,287
How can I father?

1079
01:44:30,727 --> 01:44:34,251
Don't get emotional son.
I know very well about you.

1080
01:44:45,896 --> 01:44:47,362
What great thing did you
do to sing happily?

1081
01:44:47,564 --> 01:44:50,428
Nandhini will leave in a couple of days,
you're not tensed as much as we are.

1082
01:44:50,630 --> 01:44:51,527
No need to get tensed,

1083
01:44:51,764 --> 01:44:53,856
if I talk to her for half hour,
I can flatter her.

1084
01:44:54,231 --> 01:44:55,356
You must first talk
to her to do it.

1085
01:44:55,565 --> 01:44:56,531
I can talk only if I get her alone.

1086
01:44:56,732 --> 01:44:57,528
Even if you get, she doesn't have
good impression about you.

1087
01:44:57,733 --> 01:44:59,198
I'll make a good impression.
- How?

1088
01:44:59,399 --> 01:45:00,592
See inside.

1089
01:45:04,633 --> 01:45:08,862
Waterfalls is 60 kms away
from here, get ready quickly.

1090
01:45:09,401 --> 01:45:10,697
Your batting is better than bowling.

1091
01:45:16,236 --> 01:45:20,464
You four kidnap Bond using masks,

1092
01:45:20,803 --> 01:45:25,429
I'll put him on rocks,
I'll join the group silently,

1093
01:45:25,738 --> 01:45:30,535
finding Bond missing,
everyone starts searching for him,

1094
01:45:30,739 --> 01:45:35,264
I'll take Nandhini and
show her Bond in the rocks.

1095
01:45:35,773 --> 01:45:37,865
Nandhini will hug Bond
on seeing him,

1096
01:45:38,640 --> 01:45:42,698
with tear filled eyes she'll say
I'm indebted you all my life.

1097
01:45:43,408 --> 01:45:45,204
I'll handover Bond to the family,

1098
01:45:45,508 --> 01:45:48,304
I'll take Nandhini alone and
flatter her with my sweet talk.

1099
01:45:48,576 --> 01:45:49,201
How is it?

1100
01:45:53,744 --> 01:45:55,869
I think I'll become a director.
- You will.

1101
01:45:56,244 --> 01:45:57,642
Your brother-in-law's horoscope
hasn't changed,

1102
01:45:57,845 --> 01:46:00,368
got kidnapped in story then
and now in real too.

1103
01:46:00,578 --> 01:46:02,204
That's his fate.
- Come sister.

1104
01:46:02,412 --> 01:46:03,571
I told you I'll not come.

1105
01:46:03,779 --> 01:46:05,870
Come sister, it seems the waterfalls
will be very beautiful.

1106
01:46:06,246 --> 01:46:08,872
This is nothing, I've seen
Niagara falls four times.

1107
01:46:09,247 --> 01:46:11,713
Come on sister.
- Plan misfired already.

1108
01:46:11,913 --> 01:46:13,209
This is also for our good only.

1109
01:46:13,581 --> 01:46:16,207
I'll stay back and work out
something, you carry on.

1110
01:46:18,248 --> 01:46:22,545
16, 17, 18, 19...
- Today also same buffoon's dress.

1111
01:46:22,750 --> 01:46:26,706
My fate.
- You don't know about youth.

1112
01:46:27,650 --> 01:46:30,208
Why are you still here?
We are getting late.

1113
01:46:30,650 --> 01:46:31,708
I'm not coming father.

1114
01:46:32,418 --> 01:46:33,884
You made this plan.
Why are you refusing now?

1115
01:46:34,585 --> 01:46:36,552
You go... go...

1116
01:46:40,320 --> 01:46:40,978
Aren't you coming?

1117
01:46:50,888 --> 01:46:53,411
Nandhini come quickly,
we are getting late.

1118
01:46:53,622 --> 01:46:55,713
She'll not come.
- Wait, I'm coming.

1119
01:47:06,658 --> 01:47:08,715
Come sister, it seems the waterfalls
will be very beautiful.

1120
01:47:08,925 --> 01:47:11,983
This is nothing, I've seen
Niagara falls four times.

1121
01:47:12,860 --> 01:47:17,225
Please come sister.
- I told you I'll not come.

1122
01:47:18,761 --> 01:47:22,717
Aren't you joining us, brothers?
Waterfalls will be very beautiful.

1123
01:47:23,262 --> 01:47:25,387
You carry on, we are afraid of water.

1124
01:47:29,596 --> 01:47:32,722
You come in Rishi's car,
this car is full.

1125
01:47:34,398 --> 01:47:35,455
Your father is villain to you.

1126
01:47:41,599 --> 01:47:44,566
Aren't you guys going?
- How can we without you?

1127
01:47:44,766 --> 01:47:47,733
Saved for now.
Plan to go there.

1128
01:47:48,600 --> 01:47:50,396
What do you call
a chocolate in Telugu?

1129
01:47:50,601 --> 01:47:53,397
Sweet tuber.
- Silly! 'Chocaletu'

1130
01:47:53,601 --> 01:47:55,830
Enough of having bath, come down.

1131
01:47:56,602 --> 01:48:00,399
Open the bottle first.
- I'll do it. Get me that.

1132
01:48:00,936 --> 01:48:02,834
Where are the bottles?

1133
01:48:06,437 --> 01:48:07,562
What a body!

1134
01:48:12,605 --> 01:48:13,901
Go boys!

1135
01:48:22,840 --> 01:48:25,466
Why are you massaging here?

1136
01:48:25,674 --> 01:48:28,300
You'll pay Rs.5 only,
he promised to pay Rs.100.

1137
01:48:28,509 --> 01:48:30,737
How dare you want Rs.100?

1138
01:48:30,942 --> 01:48:33,408
Why are you beating a kid?
- Who are you to stop me?

1139
01:48:33,609 --> 01:48:35,735
Who am I?
- Why are you going overboard?

1140
01:48:38,444 --> 01:48:39,569
Go away!
- How dare you hit me!

1141
01:48:39,778 --> 01:48:44,507
How dare you hit me!
- Stop boys!

1142
01:48:44,779 --> 01:48:47,745
What man? Go... go away!

1143
01:48:59,548 --> 01:49:00,809
He's here, come on boys.

1144
01:49:03,282 --> 01:49:05,748
Come out, acting smart before a girl.

1145
01:49:05,949 --> 01:49:09,746
Come out.
- Come on show your power now.

1146
01:49:13,451 --> 01:49:14,644
I beg you please... leave him.

1147
01:49:40,523 --> 01:49:43,649
What are you looking at?
Lion is there!

1148
01:50:47,403 --> 01:50:48,596
Are you fine, dad?
- Didn't get hurt...

1149
01:50:57,505 --> 01:51:00,665
Uncle, you were right.
Strength isn't for exhibition,

1150
01:51:01,506 --> 01:51:04,631
it'll come out when it's necessary.

1151
01:51:06,307 --> 01:51:32,534
~ Digital Desi Releasers ~

1152
01:51:33,979 --> 01:51:40,537
O my mischief girl, my golden girl,
I'm all at sea because of you...

1153
01:51:40,747 --> 01:51:47,272
O my mischief boy, my golden boy,
I'm all at sea because of you...

1154
01:51:47,482 --> 01:51:50,449
I followed you...
I saw your beauty...

1155
01:51:50,649 --> 01:51:53,616
I fell for your grace, O girl...

1156
01:51:53,817 --> 01:51:56,784
I gave my heart to you...
I made you say it...

1157
01:51:56,983 --> 01:52:02,281
I gave dreams to your eyes...
I've started to like you...

1158
01:52:41,593 --> 01:52:51,290
Great, you're mine...
Great, you're my biggest dowry...

1159
01:52:51,495 --> 01:53:00,953
Great, I'm yours...
Great, I'm your biggest dowry...

1160
01:53:01,330 --> 01:53:04,297
Hey girl! You're walking treasure...
I'll take it one by one...

1161
01:53:04,498 --> 01:53:09,624
Everything is yours...
why are you rushing?

1162
01:53:48,873 --> 01:53:50,396
I'll be your life partner...

1163
01:53:50,607 --> 01:53:55,302
With your beauty and youth,
adding glitter to it's sheen...

1164
01:53:55,508 --> 01:53:58,565
I'll fall flat for your beauty...

1165
01:53:58,775 --> 01:54:05,642
Among those shining stars
in the sky, you're my moon...

1166
01:54:05,844 --> 01:54:08,470
Your glitter must fill my world...

1167
01:54:08,677 --> 01:54:11,644
Fix marriage before youth rebels...
I'll become yours always...

1168
01:54:11,845 --> 01:54:17,302
Your invitation is exciting my nerves
and you've taken over me, O my dear...

1169
01:54:36,616 --> 01:54:39,082
But he's getting the sympathy.
What's this twist?

1170
01:54:41,350 --> 01:54:42,475
Is it painful son?

1171
01:54:42,784 --> 01:54:45,307
I think his pain will ease
in the store room.

1172
01:54:45,518 --> 01:54:47,814
Why to store room?
- For medicines.

1173
01:54:48,686 --> 01:54:50,811
For bigger twist, look there!

1174
01:55:01,955 --> 01:55:02,818
How are you?

1175
01:55:03,921 --> 01:55:05,410
Why did you come here?

1176
01:55:05,622 --> 01:55:06,986
How did you come here?
You've come suddenly?

1177
01:55:07,956 --> 01:55:10,320
I brought her, met her in the temple.

1178
01:55:10,523 --> 01:55:11,921
She's here on excursion.

1179
01:55:12,357 --> 01:55:13,982
She was speaking fluently in English,

1180
01:55:14,357 --> 01:55:17,324
So I liked her very much
and brought her home.

1181
01:55:17,691 --> 01:55:19,817
It seems she's yourjunior,
she told me on the way.

1182
01:55:24,126 --> 01:55:26,820
Your mother would've brought her
dad too if he speaks in English.

1183
01:55:30,427 --> 01:55:31,654
Daddy told me everything.

1184
01:55:37,795 --> 01:55:39,318
This is different Nandhini.

1185
01:55:39,529 --> 01:55:41,995
Nisha come, I'll introduce
you to my people.

1186
01:55:42,363 --> 01:55:43,329
Mother!
- What?

1187
01:55:43,530 --> 01:55:45,655
Nothing, go... go.

1188
01:55:49,798 --> 01:55:51,661
Hey! We are in for trouble.

1189
01:55:51,865 --> 01:55:53,729
What happened?
- What if Nisha meets Nandhini?

1190
01:55:54,432 --> 01:55:55,659
I told her this Nandhini is
different from that Nandhini.

1191
01:55:55,866 --> 01:55:59,321
You dimwit, what if she says
she's from Switzerland. - Go!

1192
01:56:02,467 --> 01:56:04,592
Where is Nisha?
- I introduced her to Nandhini.

1193
01:56:04,801 --> 01:56:07,824
They are talking.
- What happened to him?

1194
01:56:26,972 --> 01:56:28,598
Why did you lie to me?

1195
01:56:38,541 --> 01:56:41,007
Please have coffee.
- I'm leaving aunty.

1196
01:56:44,709 --> 01:56:47,937
She knows the truth,
her father will kill us.

1197
01:56:50,043 --> 01:56:53,999
Prabha, come in for a moment.
I want to talk to you.

1198
01:56:57,645 --> 01:57:02,340
Come whatsoever it may,
face it, go. Go!

1199
01:57:16,649 --> 01:57:18,012
Who is she?
Is she close to you?

1200
01:57:18,382 --> 01:57:19,848
My junior... why?

1201
01:57:21,049 --> 01:57:22,345
What actually had happened was...

1202
01:57:26,651 --> 01:57:29,583
I expected this.
Prabha lied to me, rascal.

1203
01:57:47,388 --> 01:57:48,082
What did you say now?

1204
01:57:50,556 --> 01:57:51,749
I'm little busy.

1205
01:57:52,055 --> 01:57:54,681
You gossip with aunty,
I'll come after sometime.

1206
01:57:59,724 --> 01:58:03,623
I was chatting with my friend,
I think she left in anger.

1207
01:58:06,726 --> 01:58:10,749
You mean didn't hear
anything she told you.

1208
01:58:12,894 --> 01:58:13,757
Didn't hear, right?

1209
01:58:14,394 --> 01:58:17,360
Good job! She's a sticky girl, big bore.

1210
01:58:17,561 --> 01:58:19,686
You called me for that, right?
That's it?

1211
01:58:21,662 --> 01:58:22,525
That's all, right?

1212
01:58:25,896 --> 01:58:27,522
Nandhini didn't hear
anything Nisha told her.

1213
01:58:27,730 --> 01:58:29,923
Even if she hears
nothing much to lose. - Why?

1214
01:58:30,130 --> 01:58:34,359
We forgot, today is the last day.
Tonight all are leaving.

1215
01:58:48,734 --> 01:58:52,360
I found a good son-in-law in this trip,
I like Rishi very much.

1216
01:58:52,568 --> 01:58:55,694
Why are you delaying it?
We are leaving tonight.

1217
01:58:56,402 --> 01:58:58,028
Let's ask Nandhini's opinion, come.

1218
01:59:02,904 --> 01:59:06,359
Whatever may happen, today I'll
express my love to Nandhini.

1219
01:59:16,673 --> 01:59:17,696
You tell her.
- You tell her.

1220
01:59:18,140 --> 01:59:19,697
You tell her.
- You tell her.

1221
01:59:20,674 --> 01:59:24,038
I want to tell you something
very important.

1222
01:59:24,575 --> 01:59:26,040
Where is Prabha, uncle?
- Why?

1223
01:59:26,408 --> 01:59:27,772
Nothing, I'll come back
in a minute.

1224
01:59:39,511 --> 01:59:40,977
Brother, come here.

1225
01:59:41,578 --> 01:59:42,874
I'm already tensed,
please leave me.

1226
01:59:43,145 --> 01:59:46,543
I'm more tense than you.
It's about my life, brother.

1227
01:59:48,180 --> 01:59:50,942
Only you can solve it.
That's why I'm telling you.

1228
01:59:56,581 --> 01:59:57,376
What happened?

1229
01:59:58,582 --> 02:00:00,548
I love a man known as Prakash,

1230
02:00:01,582 --> 02:00:04,549
he called me last night,
he got a job in Australia,

1231
02:00:04,750 --> 02:00:07,545
Rs.1 lakh salary,
will be joining in 10 days,

1232
02:00:07,750 --> 02:00:09,978
and wants to take me along
with him as his wife.

1233
02:00:12,018 --> 02:00:14,984
You're lucky.
You want your dad's approval, right?

1234
02:00:15,185 --> 02:00:17,708
That's not the issue, Prakash's parents
are money minded people,

1235
02:00:17,919 --> 02:00:21,875
he says his parents will respect me
only if I take Rs.50 lakh dowry.

1236
02:00:22,553 --> 02:00:23,645
That's why...

1237
02:00:24,687 --> 02:00:27,653
Does he love you or the dowry?

1238
02:00:27,987 --> 02:00:29,544
Think practically, brother.

1239
02:00:29,755 --> 02:00:32,482
If I go with dowry,
I'll be respected and live happily.

1240
02:00:32,688 --> 02:00:33,949
That's why I'm convinced.

1241
02:00:34,589 --> 02:00:36,487
How can you be so selfish in love?

1242
02:00:38,089 --> 02:00:39,953
Uncle struggled a lot
to send you to college,

1243
02:00:40,590 --> 02:00:42,783
how can he get money suddenly
to marry you off.

1244
02:00:44,558 --> 02:00:45,717
That's what I'm also asking,

1245
02:00:46,125 --> 02:00:48,955
without bothering about
grown up daughter's future,

1246
02:00:49,158 --> 02:00:51,556
he lost heavily in different
business deals,

1247
02:00:51,759 --> 02:00:54,055
nothing is left except this house,

1248
02:00:58,027 --> 02:01:00,550
tell my father to sell this house
and conduct my marriage, brother.

1249
02:01:01,594 --> 02:01:03,117
Do you know what you're saying?

1250
02:01:04,028 --> 02:01:06,551
If uncle sells this house,
where will he stay?

1251
02:01:07,762 --> 02:01:10,661
There's no other way than to sell
this house for my marriage,

1252
02:01:10,863 --> 02:01:12,386
why not sell it now?

1253
02:01:12,597 --> 02:01:15,154
If I miss this chance,
I may not get a better choice.

1254
02:01:16,597 --> 02:01:21,395
If I ask him, he'll say it's ancestral
property and shouldn't sell it.

1255
02:01:21,598 --> 02:01:24,565
He loves you very much,
that's why I'm asking your help.

1256
02:01:24,766 --> 02:01:27,392
Please brother, convince my father.

1257
02:01:28,767 --> 02:01:31,733
Okay, I'll talk to him.

1258
02:01:33,434 --> 02:01:34,730
Uncle, I've an important thing
to discuss with you.

1259
02:01:34,935 --> 02:01:36,730
I'm discussing important...
- Come I say. Get up.

1260
02:01:38,101 --> 02:01:39,727
What's so important thing?

1261
02:01:41,436 --> 02:01:44,732
A friend of mine Prakash,
very good boy,

1262
02:01:45,603 --> 02:01:48,729
he works in Australia,
how much you think his salary is?

1263
02:01:49,537 --> 02:01:50,798
Rs.1 lakh a month.

1264
02:01:51,171 --> 02:01:52,898
He's planning to marry
and leave in 10 days.

1265
02:01:53,939 --> 02:01:56,564
Very good match to Prasanna,
can I talk to them, uncle?

1266
02:01:59,873 --> 02:02:04,829
How responsible you're on your sister!
Since you say he's a good boy,

1267
02:02:05,740 --> 02:02:07,730
I don't have any doubt
about this proposal,

1268
02:02:08,441 --> 02:02:15,841
but they are asking Rs.50 lakhs
as dowry, uncle.

1269
02:02:17,777 --> 02:02:22,506
Rs.50 lakhs?
Then, let's sell this house.

1270
02:02:32,946 --> 02:02:34,913
What's this uncle?
You love this house, right?

1271
02:02:35,113 --> 02:02:37,409
May be but it's a good proposal.

1272
02:02:38,047 --> 02:02:40,412
Nothing is more important to me
than my daughter's life.

1273
02:02:40,614 --> 02:02:42,672
Let's sell this house and
conduct Prasanna's marriage.

1274
02:02:43,915 --> 02:02:47,075
But please keep it secret
from Prasanna. - Why uncle?

1275
02:02:47,783 --> 02:02:50,181
She may not let me sell this
house because I love it.

1276
02:02:53,817 --> 02:02:59,080
Moreover she may not agree to
marry and leave me in 10 days.

1277
02:03:03,953 --> 02:03:06,419
Why will she not agree?
I'll make her accept.

1278
02:03:06,786 --> 02:03:08,912
You don't say a word.
I'll make her say yes.

1279
02:03:13,454 --> 02:03:13,920
Come.

1280
02:03:18,622 --> 02:03:21,817
Uncle and I've fixed a match for you,
his name is Prakash,

1281
02:03:23,890 --> 02:03:25,913
he works in Australia
with Rs.1 lakh salary.

1282
02:03:30,124 --> 02:03:32,590
He's my close friend.
Very good proposal.

1283
02:03:33,125 --> 02:03:36,023
I'm refusing it wholeheartedly, brother.

1284
02:03:36,226 --> 02:03:37,590
I don't want this marriage.

1285
02:03:37,993 --> 02:03:42,460
Please agree dear, if we miss this,
we may not get a better choice.

1286
02:03:42,460 --> 02:03:44,824
That's a father!

1287
02:03:49,728 --> 02:03:54,684
Father... father...
- Calm down dear.

1288
02:03:54,896 --> 02:03:57,419
Please don't cry.
Calm down dear.

1289
02:03:57,797 --> 02:04:00,491
As a girl you've to marry and leave.

1290
02:04:01,531 --> 02:04:02,861
Calm down dear.

1291
02:04:03,065 --> 02:04:05,758
Did you see how she's crying
on talking about marriage?

1292
02:04:06,599 --> 02:04:08,827
I don't want this marriage, father.
- It's wrong. - Don't say like that.

1293
02:04:09,132 --> 02:04:11,189
We've decided,
this marriage must happen.

1294
02:04:11,833 --> 02:04:13,992
I said no, I don't want
this marriage.

1295
02:04:14,200 --> 02:04:17,928
It's wrong, you mustn't say like that.
This marriage will happen, it must.

1296
02:04:18,134 --> 02:04:19,430
What's this?
- I said no.

1297
02:04:19,634 --> 02:04:21,931
She's refusing marriage,
why are you forcing her?

1298
02:04:22,134 --> 02:04:22,930
Father...

1299
02:04:24,135 --> 02:04:25,692
This marriage must happen.

1300
02:04:26,803 --> 02:04:28,769
This marriage must happen.
- You know that boy?

1301
02:04:29,070 --> 02:04:29,763
You know.

1302
02:04:29,970 --> 02:04:32,096
I know him.
He's very smart.

1303
02:04:35,705 --> 02:04:36,602
What great Australia?

1304
02:04:36,805 --> 02:04:38,101
Is he good match to
Prasanna or not?

1305
02:04:39,205 --> 02:04:40,932
Infact he was born for Prasanna only.

1306
02:04:45,473 --> 02:04:47,769
But a small problem.
- What's it?

1307
02:04:47,974 --> 02:04:51,099
They are asking Rs.50 lakhs as dowry,
uncle wants to sell this house.

1308
02:04:51,641 --> 02:04:52,607
This house!

1309
02:04:55,041 --> 02:04:57,439
Will you sell this house?

1310
02:04:57,875 --> 02:05:00,433
Prasanna is like a daughter
to me also.

1311
02:05:00,976 --> 02:05:02,533
I too have made little money.

1312
02:05:03,143 --> 02:05:05,439
I'll bear all the marriage expenses.

1313
02:05:05,744 --> 02:05:07,767
I'll take care of the gifts.

1314
02:05:08,245 --> 02:05:13,769
We are not here to share only happiness,
allow us to share your difficulties too.

1315
02:05:13,979 --> 02:05:20,607
I too made good money in Swiss,
I'll take care of the dowry.

1316
02:05:20,814 --> 02:05:22,939
Prabha, come here.
- Tell me.

1317
02:05:23,481 --> 02:05:24,538
Call him.

1318
02:05:25,181 --> 02:05:28,444
There's a problem, marriage must
happen within 10 days,

1319
02:05:28,648 --> 02:05:30,444
because the groom is
leaving to Australia.

1320
02:05:30,983 --> 02:05:31,949
Within 10 days?

1321
02:05:32,816 --> 02:05:34,783
Okay, let's go from here after
conducting her marriage.

1322
02:05:34,983 --> 02:05:36,108
I too got the same idea.

1323
02:05:37,817 --> 02:05:41,443
I didn't know you all
love me so much.

1324
02:05:41,651 --> 02:05:45,948
Love can't be said in words,
it must be shown in deeds.

1325
02:05:54,153 --> 02:05:55,050
You!

1326
02:05:58,555 --> 02:06:01,783
I'll ensure that every guest
enjoys feast and leaves.

1327
02:06:01,989 --> 02:06:03,615
How many more days?

1328
02:06:08,823 --> 02:06:12,517
5, 6, 7, 8, 9...

1329
02:06:13,991 --> 02:06:34,489
~ Digital Desi Releasers ~

1330
02:06:35,495 --> 02:06:42,725
My life... you swelled
like sea today...

1331
02:06:42,930 --> 02:06:46,795
Doused my heart with
your golden rain...

1332
02:06:46,998 --> 02:06:50,624
What did you say with your eyes?

1333
02:06:50,832 --> 02:06:53,957
You've tied me with your breath...

1334
02:07:34,274 --> 02:07:41,640
I'm experiencing happiness today
which I never felt earlier...

1335
02:07:41,842 --> 02:07:49,140
Though young and old are watching,
I think your game will not stop...

1336
02:07:49,677 --> 02:07:57,134
You made pushed the distance
away between us...

1337
02:08:56,857 --> 02:08:58,653
Heart is thrilled with turn...

1338
02:08:58,858 --> 02:09:04,156
Have those days of
silly fights come back?

1339
02:09:04,525 --> 02:09:05,991
Happiness is doubling up...

1340
02:09:06,192 --> 02:09:11,820
It has become my most
cherished memories...

1341
02:09:12,193 --> 02:09:19,650
She's mine in this life and
in any life on this earth...

1342
02:09:39,699 --> 02:09:44,224
I can't tolerate Prabha any more.
Nandhini is always after him.

1343
02:09:44,800 --> 02:09:47,062
I don't know what to do with him.

1344
02:09:47,267 --> 02:09:49,496
Just say yes, I'll kill him.

1345
02:09:50,702 --> 02:09:52,895
No, we must plan something else.

1346
02:09:54,635 --> 02:09:57,830
Everyone hits 4's and 6's,
but never give me chance to bat.

1347
02:09:59,003 --> 02:10:01,231
What?
- Come here.

1348
02:10:01,704 --> 02:10:03,499
You're always with them only,
we too are your friends.

1349
02:10:03,704 --> 02:10:05,170
Sit with us.
- Tell me what's it?

1350
02:10:05,538 --> 02:10:08,834
A girl came for Prabha, who is she?

1351
02:10:09,039 --> 02:10:12,006
She is...
- Is she Prabha's lover?

1352
02:10:12,205 --> 02:10:14,570
No, she tried him.

1353
02:10:15,540 --> 02:10:18,166
Her father is a big Don.
He threatened Prabha to marry her.

1354
02:10:18,540 --> 02:10:21,996
But Prabha narrated a story that
he loves Nandhini and escaped.

1355
02:10:24,042 --> 02:10:27,167
What's that Don's name?
- Just now got a bottle.

1356
02:10:28,542 --> 02:10:30,668
Tell his name.
- Had food?

1357
02:10:31,043 --> 02:10:32,839
You go, we'll join later.

1358
02:10:33,543 --> 02:10:35,009
Why is he having seizures?

1359
02:10:35,544 --> 02:10:38,567
He'll not be well till he eats.
- He'll die without food.

1360
02:10:38,778 --> 02:10:39,903
Uncle, listen...

1361
02:10:43,545 --> 02:10:46,842
I want Nandhini.
- That's all! Leave it on me.

1362
02:10:49,047 --> 02:10:51,843
Come here.
Put this thread into the needle.

1363
02:10:52,048 --> 02:10:53,513
Needle... thread...
- I'm calling you only!

1364
02:10:53,714 --> 02:10:54,839
Coming! Don't shout.

1365
02:11:05,884 --> 02:11:08,510
Where did I keep my cell phone?

1366
02:11:11,217 --> 02:11:13,241
Why did he leave iron box
switched on?

1367
02:11:13,618 --> 02:11:14,607
He's always like this.

1368
02:11:31,155 --> 02:11:32,247
What happened?

1369
02:11:33,556 --> 02:11:36,681
Don't touch that iron box.
It's giving electric shocks.

1370
02:11:57,061 --> 02:11:59,027
Hey stop!

1371
02:12:01,162 --> 02:12:02,253
Stop I say!

1372
02:12:13,164 --> 02:12:16,528
Rishi, he's beating me.
- Stop!

1373
02:12:17,065 --> 02:12:18,031
Why are you beating him?

1374
02:12:18,831 --> 02:12:20,855
You don't know.
- What should I know?

1375
02:12:38,836 --> 02:12:39,927
Have you gone mad?

1376
02:12:40,569 --> 02:12:41,263
What if anything had
happened to you?

1377
02:12:41,836 --> 02:12:44,701
Shut up! Say sorry to him first.
- Father!

1378
02:12:45,071 --> 02:12:47,128
Without knowing what had happened,
you're asking me to say sorry.

1379
02:12:47,904 --> 02:12:48,700
Say sorry.

1380
02:12:48,905 --> 02:12:51,030
Why are you beating a grown
up son for trivial thing?

1381
02:12:51,238 --> 02:12:53,796
Is beating me and my friends
trivial thing to you?

1382
02:12:55,139 --> 02:12:57,037
Either I must be here
or he must be here.

1383
02:12:58,306 --> 02:13:00,034
Why are you over reacting?
Get out.

1384
02:13:00,239 --> 02:13:01,535
You stop.

1385
02:13:03,641 --> 02:13:07,199
What he did was mistake.
I'll send him out from here.

1386
02:13:07,742 --> 02:13:08,867
You please don't go.

1387
02:13:11,642 --> 02:13:12,540
You go away.

1388
02:13:21,811 --> 02:13:22,709
Why are you asking him to leave?

1389
02:13:22,911 --> 02:13:25,776
You're drunk, go away.

1390
02:13:25,978 --> 02:13:27,535
I'm not drunk, listen to me.

1391
02:13:27,746 --> 02:13:31,144
If you don't go now,
it's a promise on our friendship.

1392
02:13:38,314 --> 02:13:39,712
Why are you still standing here?
Go!

1393
02:13:39,915 --> 02:13:42,711
Do you know what you're doing?
What's all this?

1394
02:13:42,915 --> 02:13:46,871
I fear his presence may spoil
our 30 years friendship.

1395
02:13:49,150 --> 02:13:52,207
No need to be so harsh dad,
I'll go away.

1396
02:13:56,185 --> 02:13:57,208
What happened, father?

1397
02:14:08,320 --> 02:14:10,048
Please listen to me.

1398
02:14:10,254 --> 02:14:13,118
Nobody must utter a word,
all of you go in.

1399
02:14:26,758 --> 02:14:30,555
I'm sorry uncle,
I didn't beat Rishi for nothing.

1400
02:14:31,592 --> 02:14:32,558
Please forgive me.

1401
02:14:34,592 --> 02:14:38,150
You must forgive me.
He's not my son at all.

1402
02:14:40,860 --> 02:14:43,827
Your father promised on
our friendship, so I stopped.

1403
02:14:44,028 --> 02:14:45,721
If not I would've told them.

1404
02:14:48,029 --> 02:14:50,552
I said he's my son since your
father told me to say so.

1405
02:14:50,929 --> 02:14:52,225
I too don't know why.

1406
02:15:02,665 --> 02:15:03,892
I'm leaving father.

1407
02:15:07,199 --> 02:15:09,223
Till now I thought I was your world.

1408
02:15:11,266 --> 02:15:14,721
No father, you've another world.

1409
02:15:18,001 --> 02:15:19,160
Who is Rishi, father?

1410
02:15:21,702 --> 02:15:22,998
Isn't he asking you?
Answer him.

1411
02:15:25,269 --> 02:15:27,167
He'll not tell you, I'll tell you.

1412
02:15:28,037 --> 02:15:29,162
Allow me.

1413
02:15:30,604 --> 02:15:36,902
Elderly man who didn't talk to your
father for 20 years called him home.

1414
02:15:40,272 --> 02:15:43,966
You allowed me to come home,
I'm happy.

1415
02:15:45,006 --> 02:15:48,564
If you say you've forgiven me,
it'll give me peace of mind.

1416
02:15:50,141 --> 02:15:53,574
Let bygones be bygones,
the future is in your hands.

1417
02:15:53,775 --> 02:15:54,741
What are you saying?

1418
02:15:54,942 --> 02:15:59,569
We met in temple, right?
My son saw Viswa's daughter,

1419
02:16:06,344 --> 02:16:08,970
he wants to marry her only,

1420
02:16:11,178 --> 02:16:15,077
father too agreed to this because
grandson is adamant.

1421
02:16:18,114 --> 02:16:19,239
Greetings uncle.

1422
02:16:20,614 --> 02:16:21,079
Sit here.

1423
02:16:21,280 --> 02:16:24,838
Unable to ask Viswa,
father called you here.

1424
02:16:25,048 --> 02:16:26,981
You must conduct this marriage.

1425
02:16:28,949 --> 02:16:33,246
I'll give my life also to
conduct this marriage.

1426
02:16:34,117 --> 02:16:36,743
Why did you do like this?
- What happened now?

1427
02:16:37,218 --> 02:16:39,650
I don't have any objection.

1428
02:16:40,118 --> 02:16:43,085
My father who never accepted my love,

1429
02:16:43,785 --> 02:16:46,752
that family which didn't even come
to console when my wife died,

1430
02:16:47,120 --> 02:16:48,245
Nandhini hates them.

1431
02:16:50,053 --> 02:16:51,679
Nandhini will not agree
to this marriage.

1432
02:16:53,787 --> 02:16:54,754
Let's do one thing.

1433
02:16:55,388 --> 02:16:57,854
We're staying here for 10 days,

1434
02:16:58,288 --> 02:17:01,914
let introduce Rishi as
Appala Naidu's son to Nandhini.

1435
02:17:03,856 --> 02:17:06,016
Both are well educated,
they will get on well easily.

1436
02:17:07,390 --> 02:17:08,913
Let them come to
an understanding,

1437
02:17:09,124 --> 02:17:11,249
let's ask Nandhini and
get her acceptance.

1438
02:17:14,625 --> 02:17:16,921
You and your father must unite.

1439
02:17:17,159 --> 02:17:20,592
Seeing you getting close
to Nandhini,

1440
02:17:21,160 --> 02:17:23,183
fearing he may break
the given promise,

1441
02:17:23,960 --> 02:17:25,756
he's asking you to leave.

1442
02:17:34,963 --> 02:17:38,589
Is that all the matter?
Do you need all that drama?

1443
02:17:40,697 --> 02:17:43,755
It's true I love Nandhini.
But never proposed to her.

1444
02:17:44,398 --> 02:17:46,262
She too doesn't have
any feelings for me.

1445
02:17:48,031 --> 02:17:52,089
So there's nothing for you
to fear or for me to feel sad.

1446
02:17:53,733 --> 02:17:57,029
You're important to me, dad.
You're my hero.

1447
02:17:58,300 --> 02:17:59,766
I'll do anything for you.

1448
02:18:02,701 --> 02:18:06,191
Forget all this and come back happily
after conducting the marriage.

1449
02:18:09,970 --> 02:18:11,095
Mother, take care of dad.

1450
02:18:15,237 --> 02:18:19,000
You failed to understand
your son, right?

1451
02:18:19,405 --> 02:18:20,871
What do you want me to do?

1452
02:18:31,774 --> 02:18:32,604
Are you leaving?

1453
02:18:35,142 --> 02:18:37,267
Sister.
- Found it?

1454
02:18:37,642 --> 02:18:39,938
Not yet sister.
- Search properly. - Okay.

1455
02:18:41,376 --> 02:18:44,774
A small help please,
I've lost my dollar,

1456
02:18:45,043 --> 02:18:47,770
I love it,
please find it for me.

1457
02:18:47,977 --> 02:18:50,103
You say it's your life,
where will it go?

1458
02:18:51,311 --> 02:18:53,106
Search it properly,
it'll be with you only.

1459
02:19:35,254 --> 02:19:37,220
Your dance was great.

1460
02:19:37,987 --> 02:19:39,011
You too can dance well.

1461
02:19:39,220 --> 02:19:42,346
But as good as you did.
- Don't worry, I'll teach you.

1462
02:19:42,722 --> 02:19:45,620
How can you teach me?
I'm going away to Switzerland.

1463
02:19:46,822 --> 02:19:49,345
Will you forget me after
going to Switzerland?

1464
02:19:49,823 --> 02:19:53,950
I may forget anyone but not you.
- I know it.

1465
02:19:54,158 --> 02:19:57,613
I made this for you.
Take it.

1466
02:19:58,658 --> 02:20:00,352
How is it?
- Great.

1467
02:20:03,926 --> 02:20:05,017
I love it.

1468
02:20:16,928 --> 02:20:19,293
I searched, but didn't find it.

1469
02:20:19,996 --> 02:20:21,019
Did you find it?

1470
02:20:28,931 --> 02:20:29,897
Didn't find it.

1471
02:20:51,102 --> 02:20:52,295
Stop!

1472
02:20:59,337 --> 02:21:01,633
Didn't you find it really?
- No.

1473
02:21:02,004 --> 02:21:02,971
Why are you lying?

1474
02:21:03,337 --> 02:21:04,963
I saw you putting it into
your pocket.

1475
02:21:05,771 --> 02:21:07,965
I put it there so that you'll see it.

1476
02:21:10,173 --> 02:21:11,298
Didn't get me?

1477
02:21:12,173 --> 02:21:14,231
Infact I'm here for you only, Prabha.

1478
02:21:16,140 --> 02:21:18,039
When I met you at the railway gate,

1479
02:21:19,074 --> 02:21:26,634
the happiness on your face was similar to
what I saw as on your face years ago.

1480
02:21:28,409 --> 02:21:31,035
I understood I'm still in
your heart.

1481
02:21:32,944 --> 02:21:36,240
But I wanted to know
how much you love me.

1482
02:21:37,178 --> 02:21:40,906
That's why I behaved
as if I don't like you.

1483
02:21:42,279 --> 02:21:47,145
Every try you made doubled
the love I've for you.

1484
02:21:49,181 --> 02:21:50,909
No girl ever had this luck,

1485
02:21:51,347 --> 02:21:57,804
I love you and you love me,
and make you love me more.

1486
02:22:00,750 --> 02:22:02,148
I can't take it anymore.

1487
02:23:22,166 --> 02:23:23,825
What are you thinking?
Come here.

1488
02:23:25,700 --> 02:23:28,326
Your grandfather,
your paternal aunt, uncle.

1489
02:23:49,972 --> 02:23:51,767
Keep the sickles inside.

1490
02:23:58,707 --> 02:24:03,902
Why did you make me
a fool with your story?

1491
02:24:05,374 --> 02:24:11,672
But still you're lucky.
My daughter still loves you.

1492
02:24:11,976 --> 02:24:16,000
Though I lied to you,
I love Nandhini.

1493
02:24:18,044 --> 02:24:20,170
Who is she? Forget her.

1494
02:24:24,212 --> 02:24:24,837
Come.

1495
02:24:32,714 --> 02:24:35,010
Bloody! Then die!

1496
02:24:37,415 --> 02:24:38,676
Don't come near me.

1497
02:24:38,882 --> 02:24:40,075
What are you doing?
- Father!

1498
02:24:41,382 --> 02:24:44,280
You may feel sad and
shed few tears.

1499
02:24:45,382 --> 02:24:48,076
But the pain is mine.

1500
02:24:49,150 --> 02:24:51,447
If you force a marriage
for your selfishness,

1501
02:24:51,884 --> 02:24:53,680
I must go through the
pain all my life.

1502
02:24:54,052 --> 02:24:55,881
What are you trying to say?
I'm not able to get it.

1503
02:24:56,085 --> 02:24:59,848
I love Prabha.

1504
02:25:01,487 --> 02:25:02,180
Don't be in haste.

1505
02:25:02,386 --> 02:25:04,409
Prabha doesn't love you
and will never love you.

1506
02:25:10,055 --> 02:25:11,850
Prabha loves me, right?

1507
02:25:17,490 --> 02:25:18,114
No.

1508
02:25:19,990 --> 02:25:21,183
Why are you lying?

1509
02:25:22,090 --> 02:25:25,353
Nisha told me everything.
I heard everything.

1510
02:25:27,291 --> 02:25:31,781
Father, you always told me
how much you loved mother,

1511
02:25:33,326 --> 02:25:36,350
Prabha loves me more than you.

1512
02:25:41,094 --> 02:25:44,289
I failed to understand you.
- I promised your father.

1513
02:25:44,495 --> 02:25:45,359
My foot!

1514
02:25:46,429 --> 02:25:48,691
Till now never bothered about us
if we are alive or dead,

1515
02:25:48,896 --> 02:25:50,089
now his grandson likes her,

1516
02:25:50,296 --> 02:25:52,194
will he come forgetting
the past to unite with us?

1517
02:25:52,997 --> 02:25:56,929
If I didn't have a daughter,
would he be here?

1518
02:25:57,831 --> 02:26:01,127
Though you went them like a dog
for 20 long years to forgive you,

1519
02:26:01,832 --> 02:26:03,195
he didn't forgive you,

1520
02:26:04,899 --> 02:26:08,195
but you helped my love,

1521
02:26:08,399 --> 02:26:11,025
and got punished for 20 years,

1522
02:26:12,734 --> 02:26:20,362
that's why you're more important
to me than my father,

1523
02:26:20,902 --> 02:26:22,027
you're important.

1524
02:26:22,936 --> 02:26:25,698
My daughter's life is important
who loves your son.

1525
02:26:27,504 --> 02:26:31,130
I don't care about anyone,
your son is my son-in-law.

1526
02:26:33,072 --> 02:26:34,799
Your son is pure gold.

1527
02:26:35,805 --> 02:26:38,772
No, I don't want to be again...

1528
02:26:38,973 --> 02:26:40,462
There's substance in
his decision.

1529
02:26:41,240 --> 02:26:44,036
I know what was my mistake
all these days.

1530
02:26:44,874 --> 02:26:48,205
My ego stopped me from
accepting it before my son.

1531
02:26:48,407 --> 02:26:53,705
I didn't come to you
for this marriage only,

1532
02:26:55,976 --> 02:27:00,273
I wanted to come to you,
honour your friendship,

1533
02:27:00,744 --> 02:27:02,801
and get my grandson
married to her.

1534
02:27:23,915 --> 02:27:25,279
Why is Nandhini coming here?

1535
02:27:34,750 --> 02:27:37,216
You're refusing to marry my
daughter because of her, right?

1536
02:27:38,185 --> 02:27:40,879
You told me a story that she
had met with an accident.

1537
02:27:41,085 --> 02:27:45,781
I'll make the story come true.
She mustn't live.

1538
02:27:47,920 --> 02:27:49,216
Go away!

1539
02:27:56,922 --> 02:27:58,047
Start the vehicles.

1540
02:28:33,029 --> 02:28:34,052
Go away.

1541
02:30:02,447 --> 02:30:04,413
I beg you, please don't harm Prabha.

1542
02:30:04,948 --> 02:30:06,073
I love him.

1543
02:30:06,382 --> 02:30:10,076
You can take my life.
Please don't harm him.

1544
02:30:12,116 --> 02:30:14,082
I can't live without him.

1545
02:30:20,584 --> 02:30:26,143
Darling! He won't harm us.
Look there!

1546
02:30:33,053 --> 02:30:36,418
He loves our love story, isn't it sir?

1547
02:30:39,055 --> 02:30:41,248
He'll not harm us, come.
