1
00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:50,624
When will the bus reach Siripuram?

2
00:01:50,875 --> 00:01:53,416
lt'll take another 20 minutes,
l'll wake you up, go to sleep.

3
00:02:01,042 --> 00:02:04,041
A week earlier...

4
00:02:06,875 --> 00:02:08,999
Buddy! Why are you running?
- What happened?

5
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:10,624
Dog...it almost killed me.

6
00:02:10,875 --> 00:02:12,958
Dog?
Are you running scared of a dog?

7
00:02:13,459 --> 00:02:15,208
Do you know what for we're here now?

8
00:02:15,459 --> 00:02:16,624
To lynch the man who beat you.

9
00:02:16,875 --> 00:02:17,583
But don't know why he beat you.

10
00:02:17,834 --> 00:02:19,166
He was in terrific mood,
so he bashed me up.

11
00:02:19,459 --> 00:02:20,416
Will he beat if he's in mood?

12
00:02:20,667 --> 00:02:22,458
He will, he's different.
- So arrogant?

13
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:23,208
More than it!

14
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,249
Arrogance or wealth?
- In everything.

15
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,666
lfAmbani sleeps for 7 hours,
our PJ sleeps for 14 hours,

16
00:02:28,917 --> 00:02:31,874
by the time he wakes up,
half of our day would be over.

17
00:02:35,917 --> 00:02:37,874
Let's bait for him in the evening,
if morning is not possible.

18
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:41,124
There would be hundreds of
people around him always.

19
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:43,249
But he behaves as if he's all alone.

20
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,666
He's more idiotic than me.

21
00:02:45,917 --> 00:02:47,166
We don't believe it.

22
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:52,458
Can't you wake him up?

23
00:02:52,709 --> 00:02:55,041
We've had it from Sunday to Friday.

24
00:02:55,292 --> 00:02:57,916
Today is...?
- Saturday! Your chance!

25
00:02:59,542 --> 00:03:02,124
l'll not wake him.
- He'll beat for not waking him up.

26
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:03,708
Then, I'll wake him.

27
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:05,291
He'll beat for waking him up.

28
00:03:22,542 --> 00:03:23,708
Why pick a bottle sir?

29
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:26,041
Darkness is falling sir,
please wake up sir.

30
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:31,333
We can get him only after bars
and pubs close in the city.

31
00:03:31,584 --> 00:03:35,749
That's why l've chosen 4 am time,
taking Anacin to keep away sleep.

32
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,333
Anyway Anacin isn't to keep awake.
- Is it?

33
00:03:46,584 --> 00:03:47,833
He's here again!

34
00:04:01,167 --> 00:04:02,791
Hey PJ! I've warned...

35
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:05,583
Fight or scene?

36
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:08,791
lt's a fight!
Say fight.

37
00:04:09,042 --> 00:04:09,791
lt's fight!

38
00:04:10,042 --> 00:04:12,583
Delivering dialogues
saying fight, bloody...

39
00:04:14,209 --> 00:04:15,249
What happened?

40
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:17,041
Bash him boys!

41
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:19,958
Who paid the bill?
- You!

42
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:22,166
Who should fight?
- You!

43
00:04:27,042 --> 00:04:28,374
Don't you've brothers?
- We do.

44
00:04:28,625 --> 00:04:30,541
Why are you seeing here then?
Take care of him.

45
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:48,499
Come on man!

46
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:55,999
Hey, this is not Bhimli,
this is Hyderabad!

47
00:04:59,042 --> 00:05:00,208
Come in 5 minutes.

48
00:05:01,459 --> 00:05:02,208
Okay go.

49
00:05:19,709 --> 00:05:22,874
Break is over! lt's climax now!

50
00:05:24,292 --> 00:05:26,374
l need another break, PJ!

51
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:31,041
Look there! People are fighting!

52
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:33,874
Stop! Let's settle things
with discussion.

53
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:36,124
Let's discuss and settle things.

54
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:38,416
How dare you beat a constable!
- He's policeman!

55
00:05:38,709 --> 00:05:40,666
l'm talking to him, right?
- Talk to him.

56
00:05:44,334 --> 00:05:46,708
How much more time for
this silly procedures?

57
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:48,166
l'm getting late to the celebrations.

58
00:05:48,167 --> 00:05:51,708
You get involved in brawls and visit
stations quite a few times monthly,

59
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:53,916
don't you know how much time
it takes for the formalities?

60
00:05:54,167 --> 00:05:58,916
lf he speaks one more word,
you may've to bail me out again.

61
00:05:59,167 --> 00:05:59,916
No need of that.

62
00:06:00,167 --> 00:06:01,083
He beat me, sir.

63
00:06:01,334 --> 00:06:03,291
Raja Babu, I want to talk to you.

64
00:06:03,542 --> 00:06:05,708
l'll talk to anyone
when l feel like talking.

65
00:06:06,167 --> 00:06:08,708
lf you want to talk to me...

66
00:06:25,167 --> 00:06:26,541
Make a life size of it.

67
00:06:38,209 --> 00:06:39,333
He's very proud!

68
00:06:51,209 --> 00:06:54,374
Wait sir, I'll tell the matter
in one shot.

69
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:57,583
l'm Lord of Krishnagiri kingdom.

70
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:01,999
One and only heir to the tune
of 5000 crores wealth,

71
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:05,166
which has property, factories,
jewellary, farmlands, etc.,

72
00:07:05,417 --> 00:07:07,583
the point is I'm major from today,

73
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,791
l mean everything is my will
and wish from today.

74
00:07:12,209 --> 00:07:13,958
Why are you getting so emotional?

75
00:07:14,209 --> 00:07:18,166
They've entertained me till now,
let me spare them few golden words.

76
00:07:18,375 --> 00:07:20,124
Taking useless Rs.3000
and odd as salary

77
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:23,083
by a useless worker from
a useless boss,

78
00:07:23,084 --> 00:07:27,833
giving it to wife scolding
her she's useless,

79
00:07:28,084 --> 00:07:29,083
due to an useless incident resulting
in giving birth to such useless children,

80
00:07:29,084 --> 00:07:31,416
and getting them admitted into
such a useless college,

81
00:07:31,667 --> 00:07:34,083
to avoid you getting into such rut,
l'm telling you,

82
00:07:34,084 --> 00:07:35,208
study well!

83
00:07:35,459 --> 00:07:40,416
Because you don't have
a rich grandpa like I do.

84
00:07:40,667 --> 00:07:43,833
Sir, I've a suggestion for you too.

85
00:07:44,084 --> 00:07:48,041
Learn to teach well, sir, l may feel
like buying this college in future,

86
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:51,208
and may feel like firing you,

87
00:07:55,459 --> 00:07:58,458
today is my birthday,
evening l'm giving a party,

88
00:07:58,709 --> 00:08:00,124
those who drink are welcome,

89
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:02,249
those who don't drink
aren't PJ's friends,

90
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:12,874
l know Pedda Ramaraju very well.

91
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:14,249
He was a very good man.

92
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,458
But this boy is like Soni Sood
in the film 'Arundhati'.

93
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:21,874
Since Praveen's parents died
when he was a boy,

94
00:08:22,084 --> 00:08:25,416
he grew up pampered like a prince,

95
00:08:25,667 --> 00:08:30,291
they've sent him to this far
away college to reform him.- My fate!

96
00:08:30,542 --> 00:08:32,083
But his behaviour is very bad, sir.

97
00:08:32,334 --> 00:08:35,499
For keeping him away from grandpa
and the wealth,

98
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:39,124
he thinks we and studies have
kept him away and so hates us.

99
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:41,166
Though grandpa died,

100
00:08:41,167 --> 00:08:48,124
the guardian committee managed to
keep him in college by hood or crook,

101
00:08:48,542 --> 00:08:54,708
the day he joined here he told he'll
stop studies as he turns major.

102
00:08:57,167 --> 00:08:58,041
Please don't take it serious.

103
00:09:00,292 --> 00:09:05,166
lt seems you called me,
what do you want from me?

104
00:09:06,584 --> 00:09:10,124
Even ifthe necessity is yours,
you've to come to me.

105
00:09:12,167 --> 00:09:14,333
Though king is here,
you're still sitting,

106
00:09:14,584 --> 00:09:16,333
l can understand your innocence.

107
00:09:16,584 --> 00:09:18,208
Who?
- You!

108
00:09:18,209 --> 00:09:20,749
PJ, you must behave like
this with elders.

109
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,208
lf not what sir?
l've told you before.

110
00:09:23,209 --> 00:09:25,958
Studies bring me strange side effects.

111
00:09:26,209 --> 00:09:27,958
You've completed a year,

112
00:09:28,209 --> 00:09:31,124
if you word hard for two more years,
you'll get the degree.

113
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:33,083
What do you want me
to do with it, sir?

114
00:09:33,334 --> 00:09:36,166
l'll be in a position to offerjobs
to 100 people from tomorrow.

115
00:09:36,417 --> 00:09:39,999
Did you see his arrogance sir?
How can we adjust with his tantrums, sir?

116
00:09:41,042 --> 00:09:43,249
Then apply for TC.

117
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:46,166
Do l've to tell you that too sir?
Sign it yourself.

118
00:09:48,209 --> 00:09:49,583
Now he got kick on his ass.

119
00:09:49,834 --> 00:09:52,999
From today we're unknown strangers.

120
00:09:56,209 --> 00:09:59,583
lf you need any donation to the
college, come to my palace.

121
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:01,583
l'll throw it!

122
00:10:01,834 --> 00:10:02,999
Start the vehicle!

123
00:10:13,667 --> 00:10:15,416
He's another Ambani...

124
00:10:15,667 --> 00:10:17,208
He's a walking currency note...

125
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:19,083
He's young man...

126
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:20,999
By birth he's a fighter...

127
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:40,083
To take rest, he'll buy Everest...

128
00:10:40,084 --> 00:10:48,083
One and only charming guy who
can give shivers to dollars...

129
00:10:55,917 --> 00:10:59,458
He's a charming who falls
for praise...

130
00:10:59,709 --> 00:11:03,249
He's a charming guy with
bags of cash..

131
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:08,874
He says money is ageless...

132
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:24,499
Dance to the folk beat
with classical steps...

133
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:28,083
Some ignorant man said
efforts can make a man sage...

134
00:11:28,334 --> 00:11:32,166
But l say God is in money...

135
00:11:32,167 --> 00:11:35,708
God is in money...
Money is God...

136
00:11:35,959 --> 00:11:39,916
l'm the God...
Money is my boon...

137
00:11:40,167 --> 00:11:43,916
Abdul Kalam asked us to dream...

138
00:11:44,167 --> 00:11:47,291
But l, a Lord says buy those dreams...

139
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:51,124
He's poor in relatives
but rich in wealth...

140
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:55,124
He hates sweat and hates to work...

141
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:59,208
Having fun is my life's aim...

142
00:11:59,209 --> 00:12:03,166
l'm way away from sentiments...

143
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:39,791
Crow...dark crow...when l kept
a lamp in it's mouth...

144
00:12:40,042 --> 00:12:44,041
On giving the lamp to the mound...
Mound gave me grass...

145
00:12:44,042 --> 00:12:47,374
l gave the grass to the cow...
Cow gave me milk...

146
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:51,374
l gave the milk to the master...
Master taught me lesson...

147
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:55,208
l gave the lesson to uncle...Uncle gave
his daughter in marriage to me...

148
00:12:55,459 --> 00:13:00,416
Bride...ee jasmine buds...
what's his name? He's young lord!

149
00:13:03,459 --> 00:13:07,083
l'll bath in champagne...
l'll supply petrol to Gulf....

150
00:13:07,084 --> 00:13:10,624
Lend money to Bill Gates...
I'll show what arrogance is?

151
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:14,416
Power that runs life is money...
life is money...

152
00:13:14,667 --> 00:13:18,208
Money runs the life...
money is life...

153
00:13:18,459 --> 00:13:22,416
Emboss Goddess Lakshmi's
image on Dollars...

154
00:13:22,667 --> 00:13:26,208
That's my idea...

155
00:13:26,417 --> 00:13:30,083
The game I play is commonwealth...

156
00:13:30,084 --> 00:13:33,874
The game I play is commonly wealth...

157
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:41,874
l'm there in love and friendship...

158
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,041
Wait father.

159
00:14:17,334 --> 00:14:19,708
l've much to settle scores
with him, father.

160
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:21,916
Go dear.

161
00:14:35,167 --> 00:14:36,124
What?

162
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,166
lt seems you're going away.
- So what?

163
00:14:38,167 --> 00:14:39,749
What have you decided about me?

164
00:14:41,209 --> 00:14:42,333
l've to tell you once again, right?

165
00:14:44,792 --> 00:14:46,749
l mean my ex-lover Sindhu,

166
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,124
l don't have anything to say.

167
00:14:50,792 --> 00:14:54,749
Just one good bye forever, that's it!

168
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,749
You promised to be my life partner.

169
00:15:00,167 --> 00:15:04,166
l saw you in a weak moment.
l liked you.

170
00:15:04,584 --> 00:15:06,916
We dated.
Mistook it as love.

171
00:15:07,167 --> 00:15:08,958
But it isn't.

172
00:15:09,834 --> 00:15:12,208
But my love for you is real.

173
00:15:12,209 --> 00:15:17,999
l'm like a pizza, and
you're like a betel leaf.

174
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:18,833
We don't gel together.

175
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:21,374
Find some local man and marry him.

176
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:23,208
l'll bear your marriage expenses too.

177
00:15:23,209 --> 00:15:25,374
Bumper offer, special for you only.

178
00:15:27,042 --> 00:15:28,041
Don't play with emotions.

179
00:15:28,042 --> 00:15:30,041
l never played with you.

180
00:15:30,042 --> 00:15:34,583
You were never honest in love with me.
- Me?

181
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:36,791
That's why l'm taking care of my future.

182
00:15:37,042 --> 00:15:39,333
l'm concerned about my status
and stature only.

183
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:59,999
Did you see dear,
he's not a human at all?

184
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:02,416
Come dear, enough of this humiliation.

185
00:16:03,459 --> 00:16:05,624
No need to stay here anymore.
Let's go home.

186
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:07,041
Krishnagiri kingdom

187
00:16:13,042 --> 00:16:14,083
lt's wrong Raja babu.

188
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:18,249
You know how you are?
- How am I?

189
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:21,249
You look like an usherer
in a 5-star hotel.

190
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:26,083
Anyway people are waiting for me,
l'll come later.

191
00:16:26,084 --> 00:16:27,041
Let me see.

192
00:16:31,292 --> 00:16:33,666
Stop there!

193
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:36,874
Have free drinks and go away.

194
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,541
Congrats son-in-law!

195
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,874
Come Amrutha!
Sit next to him.

196
00:16:45,292 --> 00:16:45,833
This seat is yours.

197
00:16:46,084 --> 00:16:49,083
Why are you sitting here, baby?

198
00:16:49,959 --> 00:16:51,499
The seat was empty so l...

199
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:53,583
Will you sit on finding any seat free?

200
00:16:54,167 --> 00:16:56,708
What are you waiting for?
Take her away.

201
00:16:59,167 --> 00:17:00,916
l think he's not in good mood, let's go.

202
00:17:05,334 --> 00:17:09,499
l, Rudraraju belonging to the
royal family of Veeranalla,

203
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:13,708
writing this will with full
intelligence and knowledge,

204
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:17,083
the wealth left by my ancestors
and property I earned in my times,

205
00:17:17,334 --> 00:17:20,083
according to the direction
l am giving now,

206
00:17:20,084 --> 00:17:25,749
l order to be divided amongst
my heirs, relatives and dependents,

207
00:17:29,584 --> 00:17:34,333
apart from it the 5000 crore worth
factories, property, farms,

208
00:17:34,584 --> 00:17:42,333
l wish it be given to my
only heir Jayaramaraju,

209
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:49,124
but Jayaramaraju has to qualify to
certain conditions to get the wealth.

210
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:54,124
Did grandpa write like that?
- Yes.

211
00:17:54,417 --> 00:17:56,999
lf he fails to prove his qualification,

212
00:17:57,250 --> 00:18:01,374
l want the wealth be shared
by orphanages and temples,

213
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:03,791
and leave that responsibility on courts.

214
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:06,583
What are you those conditions?

215
00:18:07,042 --> 00:18:10,999
First, Praveen must complete
his bachelor's degree,

216
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:15,583
he must complete it in 3 years only!

217
00:18:16,834 --> 00:18:21,374
He must live in Siripuram Military
Rajanna hostel for those 3 years,

218
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:27,166
and must attend the
Mangamma Govt. College there.

219
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:28,999
Siripuram?
- Yes.

220
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,624
Would you like to have water, sir?

221
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:34,416
Satire on me?

222
00:18:34,667 --> 00:18:37,041
This is for not opening my
car door earlier, get out!

223
00:18:39,042 --> 00:18:41,083
On accepting the above 3 conditions,

224
00:18:41,084 --> 00:18:45,083
the next condition will be intimated
3 months afterjoining the college.

225
00:18:45,084 --> 00:18:46,416
Even ifthere's one subject arrear...

226
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:48,291
Please hear it fully!

227
00:18:49,084 --> 00:18:49,833
Why?

228
00:18:50,084 --> 00:18:51,416
Can he pass the degree?

229
00:18:52,042 --> 00:18:55,208
l went around board with Rs.1 lakh
to get him through tenth class.

230
00:18:55,459 --> 00:18:57,833
No chance he'll pass and
get the property.

231
00:18:58,084 --> 00:18:59,791
Stop...why are you going away?

232
00:19:02,042 --> 00:19:04,874
You're fired! You too are fired!
Go away!

233
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:06,458
You don't have any power to fire us.

234
00:19:06,709 --> 00:19:08,249
You haven't yet got the
reign in your hand.

235
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,249
You've much more to hear.

236
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,249
Calling me informally?

237
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:16,124
Thank me for not using bad words.

238
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:16,874
How else can a rich man
abuse a poor man than this! Joke?

239
00:19:18,709 --> 00:19:20,249
Poor...
- He'll never get the property.

240
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:23,041
Waiting for him is foolishness.

241
00:19:23,292 --> 00:19:25,874
No daddy...
let's talk to him once.

242
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:28,124
See, how he changed thinking
l wouldn't get the wealth.

243
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,874
See, how he's dragging away that girl.

244
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:32,124
Don't divert the topic.

245
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:36,916
The way 300 students are studying with
scholarships given by this kingdom,

246
00:19:37,167 --> 00:19:38,916
you too must study with that only.

247
00:19:39,167 --> 00:19:41,916
How?
- Taking Rs.2500!

248
00:19:42,167 --> 00:19:44,291
Rs.2500?
- For a month!

249
00:19:44,959 --> 00:19:46,124
Dropping out?

250
00:19:47,167 --> 00:19:48,291
l never said I'm dropping.

251
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:57,708
We're leaving to Siripuram,
pack my bags in the car.

252
00:19:57,959 --> 00:19:59,291
Fill the tank.

253
00:20:04,542 --> 00:20:05,874
Why is he cutting the call?

254
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:09,541
Notjust him, everyone of them
will cut the call for 3 years.

255
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:13,333
No servants.
Nothing!

256
00:20:13,584 --> 00:20:15,541
Must live like a common man.

257
00:20:15,792 --> 00:20:18,124
Stop! Its cost is Rs.30000!

258
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:24,208
lf you break it, it'll be deducted
from your scholarship.

259
00:20:24,209 --> 00:20:27,333
lf it's okay to you, break it.

260
00:20:28,584 --> 00:20:31,208
Where's he? Where the hell is he?

261
00:20:31,209 --> 00:20:34,416
l'm here, Raja babu.
- Are you here? l'm coming.

262
00:20:35,584 --> 00:20:36,749
Grandpa!

263
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,083
Though l've laid many conditions,
you still love me so much.

264
00:20:40,334 --> 00:20:43,791
You bloody old wag!
- Oh my God!

265
00:20:44,209 --> 00:20:45,583
No dear...

266
00:20:45,834 --> 00:20:47,583
You want to deny me getting this
property, right?- Not with that intention...

267
00:20:47,834 --> 00:20:49,583
l'll earn the degree and throw it
on the lawyer?s face,

268
00:20:49,834 --> 00:20:51,249
and take this property,

269
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,583
and spend it like hell
right before your eyes.

270
00:20:53,834 --> 00:20:56,458
You keep watching from the photo,
l'll not let you rest in peace.

271
00:20:58,209 --> 00:21:01,041
What a tragedy! I'm speaking
with photos and walls!

272
00:21:01,042 --> 00:21:02,166
Are you mad?

273
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:04,958
l'll get the property.

274
00:21:08,209 --> 00:21:10,166
lf you give me my first year
certificate and TC...

275
00:21:10,417 --> 00:21:13,208
Who is it?
You look like prince!

276
00:21:13,209 --> 00:21:15,833
No sir, l'm Praveen.
- Praveen?

277
00:21:16,084 --> 00:21:19,999
l've gone absent minded for the
last two days and two hours.

278
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:22,416
l don't remember who you are!

279
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:28,999
You're an elderly man!
You know to forgive people!

280
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:31,833
lf you give my certificates and TC,
l'll never show up again.

281
00:21:32,084 --> 00:21:34,833
Oh that one? You told me to
shove it somewhere, right?

282
00:21:35,084 --> 00:21:37,624
May be my guys would've
shoved it somewhere.

283
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:39,999
l think heard this dialogue!

284
00:21:42,042 --> 00:21:44,624
Sir, please consider at least
as your college's alumni.

285
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:46,624
Did you study here?

286
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:47,999
lf you get at least one person
to vouch for it,

287
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:50,041
l'll give your certificates and TC.

288
00:21:51,917 --> 00:21:54,124
Did you ever taught him?

289
00:21:54,125 --> 00:21:57,124
He doesn't know us and
we don't know who he is!

290
00:21:57,125 --> 00:22:00,874
There's no way l can give you TC.

291
00:22:01,917 --> 00:22:04,666
lf you want your Inter certificates,
come to my office,

292
00:22:04,917 --> 00:22:08,083
l'll throw it on your face.
Start the vehicle!

293
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:13,666
Stop the bus!

294
00:22:14,084 --> 00:22:15,666
Won't you get down?
- Why?

295
00:22:15,917 --> 00:22:18,083
Get down, we've reached Siripuram.

296
00:22:20,084 --> 00:22:21,916
Whose hen is this? Yours?

297
00:22:22,167 --> 00:22:24,083
Still didn't get down?

298
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:28,291
Looks like new to the place.

299
00:22:29,334 --> 00:22:30,083
l had another bag too.

300
00:22:30,334 --> 00:22:33,499
Who knows? Take care of your things yourself.
You go!

301
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:35,583
Why are you throwing it?
You mad man!

302
00:22:35,959 --> 00:22:40,291
Siripuram Past

303
00:22:43,167 --> 00:22:45,916

- Go!

304
00:22:48,167 --> 00:22:49,708
Where can I find Rajanna hostel?

305
00:22:51,542 --> 00:22:53,708
Who is this new variety kid?

306
00:22:53,959 --> 00:22:55,958
Do you know where Rajanna hostel is?
- I know.

307
00:22:56,209 --> 00:22:57,749
Show me the way.
- I'll not tell you.

308
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,541
Do you where's the hostel?

309
00:23:01,584 --> 00:23:03,124
Do you know where
Military Rajanna hostel is?

310
00:23:03,375 --> 00:23:06,749
Do you know you mustn't be on
road when Appi's tractor comes?

311
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,541
ls he so great man?

312
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,958
Hey Appi! You'll never change.

313
00:23:13,209 --> 00:23:14,958
What's that meeting on the road?
Bloody fools!

314
00:23:15,209 --> 00:23:17,333
Got it?
- Got wet!

315
00:23:27,167 --> 00:23:29,791
This is Military Rajanna hostel!
- This one?

316
00:23:30,042 --> 00:23:31,166
lf you pay, I'll go.

317
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:33,999
Take it.

318
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,374
Looks like a haunted house!

319
00:23:54,417 --> 00:23:55,374
Why are you putting garbage
on me, you dirty man?

320
00:23:55,625 --> 00:23:57,583
You're a dirty man,

321
00:23:57,834 --> 00:24:01,166
Bloody fool!
Why am l arguing with a fool?

lf not you, am I calling
the rickshaw puller?- l'm coming.

325
00:24:13,084 --> 00:24:15,416
What's the Rajanna doing if people
dump garbage from upstairs?

326
00:24:15,667 --> 00:24:16,833
Aren't there any rules here?

327
00:24:18,042 --> 00:24:21,416
He has only rules!
But never applies it!

328
00:24:21,667 --> 00:24:23,416
Did you take it like that?

329
00:24:23,667 --> 00:24:25,624
lf not followed, he'll rip out the skin.

330
00:24:25,875 --> 00:24:28,208
ls he so great?
Call him out.

331
00:24:28,459 --> 00:24:30,999
What's this sir?
- You keep quiet.

332
00:24:31,459 --> 00:24:33,833
l'll hand over this boy to him.

lf you tell me where's Rajanna,

335
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:46,041
You get that boy to office.

00:24:46,292 --> 00:24:49,249
Till then I'll cut his tail.
- What?

337
00:24:49,917 --> 00:24:53,666

Plants!

338
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:55,874

Call Rajanna!

342
00:25:13,542 --> 00:25:14,291

Next is a cup of milk.

357
00:25:59,209 --> 00:26:00,333

00:27:13,875 --> 00:27:16,624
Drop him in bus stand.
- Okay.

385
00:27:17,084 --> 00:27:19,458

386
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:25,874
Why wouldn't students
commit suicide then?

387
00:27:26,292 --> 00:27:30,249
l don't mind even if it's ten days,
take my bags inside.

388
00:27:32,125 --> 00:27:37,041
Donkeys must its job and

390
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:51,083
This looks like zoo not a hostel.

391
00:27:51,084 --> 00:27:55,458
You haven't yet seen much,

392
00:27:55,709 --> 00:27:58,124
No use how much you may brush.

Father!

Nobody is helping to apply

Can't you at least help me?

481

Okay, give.

00:34:01,584 --> 00:34:11,166
My heart is leaving me

What crime have l done to you?
- Don't take my life...

00:34:44,834 --> 00:34:49,374
You said love is safe and
shook away my life...

496
00:34:49,625 --> 00:34:54,166
Mock anger is beauty,
come O my sweet darling...

497
00:34:54,417 --> 00:34:57,249
For you...

498
00:34:59,209 --> 00:35:02,958
Youthfulness is sweet...

500

Just listen to me.

508
00:35:34,667 --> 00:35:39,208
Mischievous manliness has desired you...

509
00:35:39,459 --> 00:35:43,999
Heart fell for the young and handsome
and changed its attitude...

510
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:48,874
How did you steal my little heart?

511

514
00:36:03,292 --> 00:36:08,166
l'm on the verge of death...
- Shall I become the reason of it?

515
00:36:30,167 --> 00:36:34,708
Shall I drench you wet like
the mischievous rain drops?

516
00:36:34,959 --> 00:36:39,499
Shall I stop you with the
umbrella of my beauty?

517
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:44,083
Youth is a hell and
desires are torturing me...

518
00:36:44,334 --> 00:36:49,124
l'm scared of this sweet ecstasy...

519
00:36:49,125 --> 00:36:53,958
lt's a wound given by the youth...

520
00:37:12,792 --> 00:37:17,958
For me...
- For you only...

521
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:34,208
One for me too!

522
00:37:34,209 --> 00:37:36,999
ls it any savoury prepared
by your mother to give?

523
00:37:53,167 --> 00:37:54,124
This is not mine, sir.

524
00:37:54,417 --> 00:37:56,833
Then whose?
- I don't need it, sir.

525
00:37:57,084 --> 00:37:59,916
l study well sir.
Please ask anyone here, sir.

526
00:38:00,084 --> 00:38:03,208
Because of cheats like you,
such brilliant guys lose. Get out!

527
00:38:03,459 --> 00:38:05,083
Sir, he's telling truth.

528
00:38:05,667 --> 00:38:07,416
True?
- The bits are not his.

529
00:38:07,667 --> 00:38:08,833
Then whose?

530
00:38:09,042 --> 00:38:10,624
lf you don't tell me,
l'll book both of you for copying.

531
00:38:10,875 --> 00:38:12,416
Please tell him if you know, sister.

532
00:38:12,667 --> 00:38:15,083
Tell me.
- If not my life will get spoiled.

533
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:16,624
Please tell him.

534
00:38:16,875 --> 00:38:17,916
Tell me quickly.

535
00:38:20,042 --> 00:38:21,416
They're PJ's!

536
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:23,208
You sit down.

537
00:39:00,459 --> 00:39:00,874
No Praveen..
- What no?

538
00:39:00,875 --> 00:39:02,916
lf some useless guy is more
important than me,

539
00:39:03,167 --> 00:39:04,249
don't talk to me.

540
00:39:05,334 --> 00:39:07,583
l trusted you and told my secrets.

541
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:12,291
You made me a fool in public!

542
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:18,124
About the squad! Bribed them Rs.10000,
they saluted me and left.

543
00:39:19,167 --> 00:39:20,583
But that student's life...

544
00:39:24,167 --> 00:39:27,291
His life is important, right?
Go to him. Go!

545
00:39:29,334 --> 00:39:32,124
l wanted to make you
my queen in few days,

546
00:39:32,125 --> 00:39:33,874
but this is also good to me,

547
00:39:35,334 --> 00:39:36,749
l knew who you really are!

548
00:39:37,542 --> 00:39:39,499
l came to know the value
l must give you.

549
00:39:40,792 --> 00:39:45,541
l give more respect than my
grandpa's wealth to my ego!

550
00:39:45,792 --> 00:39:47,166
You hit me there!

551
00:39:48,792 --> 00:39:49,333
Come on boys!

552
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:06,291
No dear, please listen to me.
Forget him.

553
00:40:11,209 --> 00:40:13,208
NCC or NSS?

554
00:40:13,417 --> 00:40:17,791
You woke me up and
asking questions, you fool!

555
00:40:18,209 --> 00:40:21,791
All got up and are exercising,
you're sleeping like a lord.

556
00:40:22,042 --> 00:40:23,791
You want special invitation?
Get up and come to the ground.

557
00:40:24,042 --> 00:40:25,166
Come here.
- What?

558
00:40:25,417 --> 00:40:27,166
ls that your money?
- Where?

559
00:40:29,417 --> 00:40:32,666
Come fast, buddy.
lf not no lunch.

560
00:40:33,625 --> 00:40:36,166
PJ! Your shoes are safe for today.

561
00:40:44,042 --> 00:40:47,208
That short is mine, will you take from
body also along with drying in sun?

562
00:40:47,459 --> 00:40:48,999
Which are yours and
which is mine, brother.

563
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:51,208
This is yours. Take it.
- Damn fool!

564
00:40:51,459 --> 00:40:53,291
You'll watch fun if they remove
it in Bombay trains.

565
00:40:55,667 --> 00:40:57,208
What's this at midnight?

566
00:40:57,459 --> 00:40:59,416
Midnight? This is early morning 5 am.

567
00:40:59,667 --> 00:41:02,624
First time l'm seeing this part of day.
- This part?

568
00:41:04,667 --> 00:41:08,833
You've to join NCC or NSS
to study in Govt. College.

569
00:41:09,084 --> 00:41:10,833
That's for people who have
to stay here and study.

570
00:41:11,084 --> 00:41:12,291
l'll manage it.

571
00:41:13,042 --> 00:41:14,124
l think it's difficult.

572
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:20,458
This is Mangamma Govt. Degree College.

573
00:41:20,709 --> 00:41:23,458
A famous college from where great men
and scholars passed out.

574
00:41:23,709 --> 00:41:27,666
That's why l'm doing many degrees
here for the past 5 years.

575
00:41:27,917 --> 00:41:29,083
You stop that nonsense.
- I'll beat you.

576
00:41:29,084 --> 00:41:32,083
Hindi master is coming.
Speak in Hindi.

577
00:41:32,084 --> 00:41:34,249
l don't know to speak Hindi.
- Why tension?

578
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:39,041
Hey Puranam Nagaraju!
Where did you go for two days?

579
00:41:39,292 --> 00:41:41,083
What? What did you say now?
Come again.

580
00:41:41,084 --> 00:41:43,249
Masterji, you...

581
00:41:43,917 --> 00:41:47,916
What's that? Say you!
- Listen.

582
00:41:48,125 --> 00:41:51,666
Hey Puranam Nagaraju!
Where did you go for two days?

583
00:41:52,709 --> 00:41:55,083
You fool! Say it again.

584
00:41:55,334 --> 00:41:56,708
What should you say for two days?

585
00:41:56,959 --> 00:41:59,916
Yesterday and one day past.

586
00:42:00,542 --> 00:42:01,916
You idiot!

587
00:42:02,167 --> 00:42:04,708
Are you speaking in English leaving
state language and mother tongue?

588
00:42:04,959 --> 00:42:07,499
You spiny haired Pulakesi!

589
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:08,916
Yesterday and day before.

590
00:42:09,167 --> 00:42:11,124
Say it in Hindi.
- Cry it in Telugu.

591
00:42:11,125 --> 00:42:12,916
Cry has no language sir.

592
00:42:13,167 --> 00:42:14,083
Cry is some language.

593
00:42:14,334 --> 00:42:16,499
You'll beat if we don't
speak in Telugu,

594
00:42:16,750 --> 00:42:18,916
you'll beat ifwe don't
speak in Hindi,

595
00:42:19,167 --> 00:42:22,124
do one thing sir, you take
the Telugu version,

596
00:42:22,125 --> 00:42:23,958
and you take the Hindi version of it,

597
00:42:24,209 --> 00:42:25,333
and please leave us.

598
00:42:25,584 --> 00:42:27,166
All three of you cry in three languages.

599
00:42:27,167 --> 00:42:29,166
Grandpa! What's this fate!

600
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,333
Thank God you're dead,
if not l would kill you now.

601
00:42:36,209 --> 00:42:37,333
Why is he calling me now?

602
00:42:38,167 --> 00:42:39,166
Tell me.

603
00:42:39,167 --> 00:42:42,166
To find about your welfare.
lt's a remote village...

604
00:42:42,167 --> 00:42:43,958
You don't worry,

605
00:42:44,209 --> 00:42:46,958
a lion will eat meat
only whether in forest or in zoo.

606
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:49,124
You get ready to find yourself
a newjob.

607
00:42:49,375 --> 00:42:52,749
Nothing is more peaceful than your
mouth shut and tonsured head.

608
00:42:52,959 --> 00:42:53,958
That's the meaning of your life.

609
00:42:54,167 --> 00:42:56,208
You shut your gob!

610
00:42:57,250 --> 00:42:58,374
According to lndian Education system,

611
00:42:58,625 --> 00:43:00,999
if you complete degree in two years,
it's under graduate.

612
00:43:01,250 --> 00:43:02,166
Say it in Telugu.

613
00:43:02,417 --> 00:43:05,166
Telugu? How can you do degree
in two years?

614
00:43:05,834 --> 00:43:07,583
l'll not study but buy it.

615
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,958
l've a big offer for you sir.

616
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,166
lt's not good for you
if l study in this college.

617
00:43:23,042 --> 00:43:24,791
l too don't have that much patience.

618
00:43:25,042 --> 00:43:26,333
But l need the certificate.

619
00:43:26,584 --> 00:43:28,999
lf you tell me what you want...
- Tell me what it is?

620
00:43:29,250 --> 00:43:30,791
l've met you somewhere.

621
00:43:33,250 --> 00:43:34,499
Oh military!

622
00:43:35,042 --> 00:43:40,416
Now l got it.
- What? That l'm the principal.

623
00:43:40,667 --> 00:43:42,833
You're also a part of this match fixing.

624
00:43:43,084 --> 00:43:48,499
So you knew the rules and
conditions of the will before hand.

625
00:43:48,875 --> 00:43:50,999
l know it. No need of details.

626
00:43:51,250 --> 00:43:52,333
How much can you pay?

627
00:43:55,250 --> 00:43:56,416
lf you ask me how much...

628
00:43:58,084 --> 00:44:01,041
2% percent of my property,
it's too much,

629
00:44:01,042 --> 00:44:03,833
you can build two colleges
after your retirement.

630
00:44:04,125 --> 00:44:05,541
Don't hesitate.

631
00:44:06,292 --> 00:44:10,083
Rajanna, last year student Suri
is teasing girls,

632
00:44:10,084 --> 00:44:13,041
shall we cover him under blanket
and bash in college campus?

633
00:44:13,292 --> 00:44:15,041
Bash him.
- No need to beat him sir.

634
00:44:15,292 --> 00:44:16,666
Let's pour honey into his pant,

635
00:44:16,917 --> 00:44:20,458
if we tie him in the backyard
near the anthill,

636
00:44:20,709 --> 00:44:22,458
for one month he can't take a leak.

637
00:44:22,709 --> 00:44:24,041
Why is he talking like a criminal?

638
00:44:24,292 --> 00:44:26,249
lsn't it? Let's throw acid on him, sir.

639
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:28,666
lt's lying waste in college lab.
- This is correct.

640
00:44:28,917 --> 00:44:30,666
ls this college or central jail?

641
00:44:30,917 --> 00:44:33,624
This is college, he's Praveen
Jayaramaraju I told you about.

642
00:44:33,875 --> 00:44:36,083
ls it him? We can reform him!

643
00:44:39,334 --> 00:44:42,124
So, you've told them
everything about me.

644
00:44:42,125 --> 00:44:45,083
lt's big plan, this is match fixing.
- Yes fixing!

645
00:44:45,334 --> 00:44:49,291
We come to this profession after
fixing to change students like you.

646
00:44:49,542 --> 00:44:50,499
We'll change you!

647
00:44:51,125 --> 00:44:52,499
Sir, I...

648
00:44:54,167 --> 00:44:55,083
Your study in City College,

649
00:44:55,334 --> 00:44:57,124
and asking them to shove your
certificates somewhere,

650
00:44:57,125 --> 00:44:58,499
your wealth, the will,

651
00:44:58,750 --> 00:45:01,083
the condition that you'll not get
a pie without degree certificate,

652
00:45:01,334 --> 00:45:02,291
we know everything.

653
00:45:02,542 --> 00:45:04,291
All your ways are closed, PJ.

654
00:45:04,542 --> 00:45:09,499
The only help we can give is to take
into consideration your first year in city,

655
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:11,708
and allowing you to sit in
the second year class,

656
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:17,333
that exemption is given because
we can't tolerate you for 3 long years.

657
00:45:17,792 --> 00:45:20,124
ln 3 months first year supplementary
exams are scheduled,

658
00:45:20,375 --> 00:45:23,333
the twist in this is,
if you fail in that exam,

659
00:45:23,584 --> 00:45:26,333
according to the college rules,
you could be expelled.

660
00:45:26,584 --> 00:45:28,541
l'm giving you this bumper offer.

661
00:45:28,792 --> 00:45:30,958
You can leave if you don't
like the offer. Ready to go?

662
00:45:31,584 --> 00:45:34,333
l'll go.
- It seems he'll go.

663
00:45:34,584 --> 00:45:36,958
To the class room!
You show me the way.

664
00:45:37,167 --> 00:45:39,166
Get up!
- Go to the back bench.

665
00:45:40,584 --> 00:45:43,166
Do you want the front bench?
- Have you become so proud?

666
00:45:43,417 --> 00:45:44,166
They'll go.

667
00:45:48,250 --> 00:45:50,999
Come brother! Please sit down.
My brother!

668
00:45:51,417 --> 00:45:53,166
Sister-in-law! Look there!

669
00:45:57,209 --> 00:45:58,374
This is your class room.

670
00:45:58,625 --> 00:46:00,374
l forgot my book, bring it. Go.

671
00:46:04,625 --> 00:46:06,166
Why is she here?

672
00:46:09,209 --> 00:46:10,166
What do you want?

673
00:46:12,834 --> 00:46:22,791
First time l saw you,
myriad of emotions hit my heart...

674
00:46:25,667 --> 00:46:28,208
She fell down again.
Get up!

675
00:46:28,459 --> 00:46:29,624
How many times will you fall down?

676
00:46:29,875 --> 00:46:31,999
Uddhandam sir is coming, silence please.

677
00:46:34,042 --> 00:46:37,041
Allasani Peddanna wrote 'Manu Charithra'.

678
00:46:37,042 --> 00:46:38,833
A great poem in it.

679
00:46:40,875 --> 00:46:42,291
He'll never reform.

680
00:46:44,875 --> 00:46:46,208
Yesterday you whistled
at Revathi, didn't you?

681
00:46:46,459 --> 00:46:50,624
Come on whistle at me now!
Bloody idiot!

682
00:46:50,875 --> 00:46:54,083
l'll kill you boy!

683
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:56,874
Hole or dump?

684
00:46:57,125 --> 00:47:00,041
Even my husband dare not
touch me without my permission,

685
00:47:00,292 --> 00:47:02,874
how dare you touch me
and say chill!

686
00:47:03,125 --> 00:47:06,458
You don't know about me,
l'll take you to task.

687
00:47:07,292 --> 00:47:08,666
She generally washes clothes.

688
00:47:08,917 --> 00:47:11,083
lf anybody crosses her path,
she'll wash him clean.

689
00:47:11,084 --> 00:47:15,041
She's Rathamma!
- No psychopath!

690
00:47:25,375 --> 00:47:26,083
Who is that?

691
00:47:26,334 --> 00:47:29,291
Why are you asking me?
l'm front, ask who is behind.

692
00:47:31,167 --> 00:47:33,083
lt's not me, Guruji.
- I know.

693
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:35,916
Got saved!
- I didn't get him.

694
00:47:36,167 --> 00:47:40,708
When I do, I'll split him
into two halves!

695
00:47:40,959 --> 00:47:42,916
l'll teach him what a Guru is!

696
00:47:43,167 --> 00:47:46,083
God! Give me one opportunity!

697
00:47:48,959 --> 00:47:49,916
You?

698
00:47:50,167 --> 00:47:51,083
When can I return this book again?

699
00:47:53,917 --> 00:47:57,541
You nasty idiot!
Stress on the last letter!

700
00:47:57,792 --> 00:48:00,124
You slapped me and then
troubling with tongue twisters.

701
00:48:01,167 --> 00:48:03,333
Say clearly again!

702
00:48:03,584 --> 00:48:04,958
How dare you beat a degree student!

703
00:48:05,167 --> 00:48:07,166
Stay put here,
l'll come back for you.

704
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:09,166
Bloody bear faced!
- Bear...

705
00:48:09,584 --> 00:48:11,541
God gave me the opportunity.

706
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,124
For pronouncing the word again wrongly
he beat me again and again.

707
00:48:15,375 --> 00:48:16,333
Stop!

708
00:48:18,209 --> 00:48:20,333
He says again!
What's that?

709
00:48:20,584 --> 00:48:25,749
No sir, it's again!
Marriage...sacred thread! Kali!- Stop!

710
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,749
Did you complain about me this guy?

711
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,208
l taught him as well as his father.

712
00:48:31,209 --> 00:48:34,208
He's now in this position
because of my beatings.

713
00:48:34,209 --> 00:48:35,166
lsn't it?
- Yes master.

714
00:48:35,417 --> 00:48:37,166
You say now.
- Again?

715
00:48:38,417 --> 00:48:40,999
Sacred thread....eyes...

716
00:48:41,834 --> 00:48:43,958
He's slapping me to death sir.
- Stop!

717
00:48:44,209 --> 00:48:46,583
Come to college tomorrow
in a dhoti,

718
00:48:46,834 --> 00:48:48,791
that's my punishment to you.
- Me?

719
00:48:49,042 --> 00:48:50,958
lsn't it?
You say now.

720
00:48:51,417 --> 00:48:53,458
Fruits...eyes...

721
00:48:54,209 --> 00:48:58,166
What you said means arrack?
You too come in a dhoti tomorrow. ldiot!

722
00:49:00,584 --> 00:49:02,208
Punishment to Rajanna himself!

723
00:49:21,875 --> 00:49:26,208
Oh no, l've lost all my money...

724
00:49:26,459 --> 00:49:30,833
My purse is empty...

725
00:49:33,459 --> 00:49:36,041
Look like beggars batch near
Ameerpet signal.

726
00:49:38,084 --> 00:49:41,041
My credit card is not working...

727
00:49:44,125 --> 00:49:48,041
l've lost everything l had...
- Kajal come, I'm Bhairava.

728
00:49:48,292 --> 00:49:52,458
lt has come to an end,
matter has reached to a quarter...

729
00:49:52,709 --> 00:49:55,458
lt has taken the honour to the dogs...

730
00:49:55,709 --> 00:50:01,666
The man who devours pizzas and burgers
is given a finishing touch of chutney...

731
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:10,291
Bloody gang of robbers!
Won't you let me sleep?

732
00:50:11,334 --> 00:50:14,291
All the characters are set,
have to find actors for two only.

733
00:50:14,542 --> 00:50:16,708
What to do?
- I want her to do the girl's character.

734
00:50:16,959 --> 00:50:17,916
No way, I'll not do.

735
00:50:18,167 --> 00:50:19,999
Who would suit the servant's character?

736
00:50:27,542 --> 00:50:30,083
My prince!

737
00:50:38,125 --> 00:50:39,291
What a great thing!

738
00:50:40,334 --> 00:50:43,749
What's your problem?
- No problem.

739
00:50:43,959 --> 00:50:47,333
We're staging a drama to raise
funds for flood affected victims.

740
00:50:47,584 --> 00:50:50,041
We're collecting donations for it.

741
00:50:52,209 --> 00:50:53,124
We don't want money, PJ.

742
00:50:53,375 --> 00:50:56,958
There's character in it,
we think you're best suited for it.

743
00:50:57,167 --> 00:51:00,333
lf he does that character,
l'll do the lady's character.- What?

744
00:51:00,584 --> 00:51:02,541
A senior servant's character
in a big bungalow.

745
00:51:02,792 --> 00:51:04,958
Servant? Me?

746
00:51:05,209 --> 00:51:06,333
Yes, you!

747
00:51:06,792 --> 00:51:08,208
Apply make up to him.

748
00:51:14,959 --> 00:51:18,124
He looks like a real servant.
He's the servant.

749
00:51:19,417 --> 00:51:21,374
You're the best servant!

750
00:51:24,250 --> 00:51:26,791
Your face isn't rich unless
you wear costly clothes.

751
00:51:27,834 --> 00:51:29,999
How natural you look in
the servant's get up.

752
00:51:30,250 --> 00:51:31,166
To hell with you!

753
00:51:31,417 --> 00:51:35,374
You look perfect in servant's
dress than me.

754
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:43,374
Notjust one or two,
there are 42 toilets here, PJ!

755
00:51:43,625 --> 00:51:46,791
l'll be worried if it's less.

756
00:51:47,042 --> 00:51:48,624
Not in words, show your
prowess in action.

757
00:51:48,834 --> 00:51:50,624
You'll die on seeing the toilets.

758
00:51:50,875 --> 00:51:55,624
Don't send one at a time, send brush,
acid, phenol at a time.

759
00:51:56,667 --> 00:51:57,624
Fool!

760
00:52:08,875 --> 00:52:13,833
Shower baths and swimming pools
have become mirages...

761
00:52:14,084 --> 00:52:17,208
Got the stick!
- It has taken him to task...

762
00:52:20,834 --> 00:52:25,666
The boy has come from
palace to toilet...

763
00:52:25,917 --> 00:52:28,458
ln one shot he has realised God...

764
00:52:28,709 --> 00:52:32,041
And made the boy squeal in pain...

765
00:52:32,292 --> 00:52:37,249
Easy life in AC bar has
come to an end...

766
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:40,249
The end was quite bitter shock...

767
00:52:42,917 --> 00:52:45,083
The life of luxury is far away...

768
00:52:45,084 --> 00:52:50,041
His life is going from
bad to worse...

769
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:52,458
With one shot he's dead on ground!

770
00:52:52,709 --> 00:52:54,874
40 toilets is not easy task,
even l couldn't do it.

771
00:52:55,084 --> 00:52:57,083
Shut up.
- He's damn tired.

772
00:52:57,542 --> 00:53:00,499
l'm not getting sleep,
please tell me a good story.

773
00:53:00,750 --> 00:53:02,708
l don't have the patience.
- Tell me.

774
00:53:03,542 --> 00:53:06,499
Midnight...lt has four legs!
- Don't want that story. Tell me another.

775
00:53:06,750 --> 00:53:08,083
lf another two falls...

776
00:53:08,334 --> 00:53:11,708
Okay, outside the village,
thick forest area,

777
00:53:11,959 --> 00:53:14,083
Abracadabra is walking alone,

778
00:53:16,125 --> 00:53:17,083
a big noise,

779
00:53:29,167 --> 00:53:30,749
Who is it? I'm Chandramukhi!

780
00:53:39,584 --> 00:53:42,541
l'm dead tired with body aches and
you're narrating a ghost story.

781
00:53:42,792 --> 00:53:45,333
Pulakesi! Come here.

782
00:53:46,584 --> 00:53:47,833
ls it good?

783
00:53:50,167 --> 00:53:52,333
Will you tell a ghost story?

784
00:53:55,375 --> 00:53:57,333
Last night they'd a fight in hostel.

785
00:54:09,209 --> 00:54:14,374
The bad time is laying
conditions to the lord...

786
00:54:14,625 --> 00:54:17,583
Fate mauled him badly...

787
00:54:17,834 --> 00:54:20,374
Handed over a broom to his hand...

788
00:54:20,625 --> 00:54:23,791
Dusted out his arrogance...

789
00:54:24,042 --> 00:54:28,958
The life that was roaming carefree
has turned into a bus stand...

790
00:54:29,209 --> 00:54:32,583
And made him toil like a donkey...

791
00:54:32,834 --> 00:54:36,833
Lost the royal luxurious life...

792
00:54:37,084 --> 00:54:41,833
Down with Rajanna fever...

793
00:54:42,084 --> 00:54:42,833
What happened?

794
00:54:43,084 --> 00:54:44,999
PT sir requested PJ.
- What?

795
00:54:47,459 --> 00:54:52,208
Any student studying here must
eitherjoin NCC or NSS!

796
00:54:53,250 --> 00:54:54,208
What have you decided?

797
00:54:54,459 --> 00:54:55,416
This is not like a request.

798
00:54:55,667 --> 00:54:57,999
According to lPC, the first one
is attempt to murder,

799
00:54:58,250 --> 00:54:59,999
and second is section 503!
Threatening!

800
00:55:00,250 --> 00:55:02,208
He says it's not a threat,
you keep quiet.

801
00:55:03,875 --> 00:55:05,208
How would l know which one is better?

802
00:55:05,459 --> 00:55:07,166
l waiting to ask you and decide.
- Shall I suggest?

803
00:55:08,084 --> 00:55:09,999
NSS mean traffic control,

804
00:55:10,250 --> 00:55:12,874
find lost children in festivals,
and cleaning their running noses,

805
00:55:13,125 --> 00:55:15,041
and helping the old to cross the road.

806
00:55:15,292 --> 00:55:16,874
l hate men or their sweat.

807
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:22,458
NCC means morning walks, coffees,
tiffins, idlies, at times camps,

808
00:55:22,709 --> 00:55:25,041
campfires and girls,
and spending time with them,

809
00:55:25,292 --> 00:55:27,041
it'll be different.

810
00:55:27,709 --> 00:55:28,874
Okay this one.

811
00:55:30,125 --> 00:55:32,041
lt's nearer to my pub culture.

812
00:55:33,125 --> 00:55:33,666
Where's he?

813
00:55:36,709 --> 00:55:39,874
My committee decided that NCC
is best for me.

814
00:55:41,750 --> 00:55:42,458
Sir!

815
00:55:43,125 --> 00:55:44,458
Our new recruit.

816
00:55:45,292 --> 00:55:46,291
Original?

817
00:55:52,167 --> 00:55:53,499
Hail mother lndia!

818
00:56:00,959 --> 00:56:05,708
Life of fun and salsa dances
is over...

819
00:56:05,959 --> 00:56:08,708
Difficulties have taken
over the life...

820
00:56:08,959 --> 00:56:11,499
lt broke the legs of arrogance...

821
00:56:11,750 --> 00:56:15,083
And left the legs with sores...

822
00:56:15,334 --> 00:56:20,124
Unlucky has attacked, hauled
and mauled him...

823
00:56:20,375 --> 00:56:21,541
So what?

824
00:56:22,792 --> 00:56:24,749
He was left with a begging bowl...

825
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:28,541
And toil hard for a meal...

826
00:56:30,209 --> 00:56:32,541
Bungalows and palaces have vanished...

827
00:56:32,792 --> 00:56:38,333
lt has left him with poverty
stricken life...

828
00:56:39,209 --> 00:56:40,124
Won't you please give me?

829
00:56:50,375 --> 00:56:52,541
Run out?
- Stumped.

830
00:56:53,834 --> 00:56:56,208
Egg? Serve me.

831
00:56:59,042 --> 00:57:00,791
No need to taste while eating.

832
00:57:01,042 --> 00:57:04,583
That's the lunch. Eat.
- Unjust! Is this pub culture?

833
00:57:04,834 --> 00:57:07,166
Will you make me go around
sixty times for a cheap upma?

834
00:57:07,417 --> 00:57:09,374
l used to go in car to piss.

835
00:57:09,625 --> 00:57:12,041
We can run when war starts,
why to run from now?

836
00:57:12,042 --> 00:57:12,999
Did you get a cashew in upma?

837
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,374
ls there so much upma
to get a cashew?

838
00:57:15,625 --> 00:57:16,791
l got one.

839
00:57:22,625 --> 00:57:26,083
Run again?
l'll escape to NSS!

840
00:57:29,459 --> 00:57:31,999
lt seems you want to shift
from NCC to NSS.

841
00:57:33,459 --> 00:57:35,833
l felt helping a man directly is
better than learning to fire a rifle.

842
00:57:36,084 --> 00:57:46,041
People who are waiting for help,
to tell them l'm there for...

843
00:57:47,459 --> 00:57:50,416
l want to help people.
l've decided.

844
00:57:51,875 --> 00:57:53,791
lt's good to help others.

845
00:57:54,084 --> 00:57:56,874
l'll introduce your group leader,
follow her instructions.

846
00:57:57,125 --> 00:58:00,083
She is...
- Sindhu sir.

847
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:04,041
Have you decided like that?
- Follow her.

848
00:58:04,292 --> 00:58:05,666
Me sir?

849
00:58:08,917 --> 00:58:11,458
NSS means...
- You needn't have to tell me, I know.

850
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:13,458
Do you know everything?

851
00:58:14,084 --> 00:58:16,874
l thought you no nothing and wanted
to keep you uninformed for a month.

852
00:58:17,125 --> 00:58:19,249
lf you know everything,
start helping the villagers.

853
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:21,249
Help the...
- Villagers!

854
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:22,458
God!

855
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:24,666
Go man!

856
00:58:28,959 --> 00:58:30,124
Who are you standing on
road like a block?

857
00:58:30,125 --> 00:58:31,916
Me?
- Yes you.

858
00:58:38,125 --> 00:58:39,916
How dare you stop me in my village!

859
00:58:40,167 --> 00:58:43,124
You'll get wet.
- No need, l'm wet already.

860
00:58:45,750 --> 00:58:46,916
Taking buffaloes on road.

861
00:58:47,125 --> 00:58:48,124
l'm talking to you.

862
00:58:50,167 --> 00:58:52,083
Got tired for this?

863
00:58:58,125 --> 00:59:00,208
What happened?

864
00:59:00,959 --> 00:59:03,083
My hand slipped and it entered inside.

865
00:59:03,750 --> 00:59:06,166
You've any problem?
Come, I'll console you.

866
00:59:07,167 --> 00:59:09,749
lt's stinking! Where's the tap?

867
00:59:18,375 --> 00:59:21,958
Didn't l tell you he can't work
and would be resting?

868
00:59:23,584 --> 00:59:27,166
How dare you sleep on duty!
20 marks less.

869
00:59:27,792 --> 00:59:28,958
Minus marks?

870
00:59:43,209 --> 00:59:45,208
l beat him, if you want suspend me.

871
00:59:45,209 --> 00:59:46,791
l'll take a week's rest.

872
00:59:47,042 --> 00:59:48,374
You've crossed that stage long back.

873
00:59:48,625 --> 00:59:50,583
Matter would've reached
Kannababu's father.

874
00:59:50,834 --> 00:59:52,041
ls he such a great man?

875
00:59:52,042 --> 00:59:54,958
Any life is same to him,
whether it's fish or human.

876
00:59:56,625 --> 00:59:57,791
How dare he beat my son!

877
00:59:58,042 --> 00:59:59,583
Come on boys!

878
01:00:00,209 --> 01:00:01,374
He's the one who beat him.

879
01:00:03,209 --> 01:00:04,374
Pick him up.

880
01:00:05,209 --> 01:00:06,166
Uncle...

881
01:00:07,042 --> 01:00:08,791
This is injustice sir.

882
01:00:13,084 --> 01:00:13,791
Sit here.

883
01:00:15,042 --> 01:00:17,041
He's the guy who beat our boy.

884
01:00:18,250 --> 01:00:21,624
Did you beat my son?
Yes, I beat him.

885
01:00:21,875 --> 01:00:23,624
lf I beat him,
will you bring me here by force?

886
01:00:23,875 --> 01:00:25,208
lf you want hand me over to police.

887
01:00:25,667 --> 01:00:27,041
Why did you bring me here?

888
01:00:28,084 --> 01:00:30,833
lf you beat me,
l'll take you all to the court.

889
01:00:31,250 --> 01:00:33,083
l'm going.
- You stop!

890
01:00:34,459 --> 01:00:35,624
All of you go.

891
01:00:36,084 --> 01:00:37,999
Sop! l'm coming, make him sit there.

892
01:00:38,250 --> 01:00:40,208
Where can he go?
Sit down.

893
01:00:58,125 --> 01:01:01,041
Won't boys have a fight?

894
01:01:01,292 --> 01:01:04,083
Didn't we've fights as kids
with other boys and girls?

895
01:01:04,084 --> 01:01:07,249
Did you ask if they'd food?
- Take it.

896
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:12,249
Your father went fishing
specially for you.

897
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:15,666
My son loves fish curry.
- Okay, serve mother.

898
01:01:15,917 --> 01:01:18,874
Did you beat our son Kannababu?

899
01:01:19,167 --> 01:01:20,708
You did a good thing.

900
01:01:20,917 --> 01:01:23,708
He's away in city for
5 years to study.

901
01:01:23,959 --> 01:01:25,499
He comes only once a year.

902
01:01:25,750 --> 01:01:28,083
l saw him because of you,
l don't mind if you beat him.

903
01:01:28,334 --> 01:01:31,291
Keep quiet, mother. He beat me only
once but you said many times.

904
01:01:31,542 --> 01:01:36,499
Beat him on face if you want to,
never hit on his stomach.

905
01:01:37,167 --> 01:01:41,499
He has some liver problem.
- I'll be fine.

906
01:01:44,750 --> 01:01:45,999
Aren't you angry on me?

907
01:01:46,542 --> 01:01:48,083
Didn't you get me to beat?

908
01:01:48,334 --> 01:01:51,916
Our son would've done some
mistake that's why you got angry.

909
01:01:53,209 --> 01:01:57,124
Before the wound on his face heals,
your anger must cool down.

910
01:01:57,375 --> 01:02:01,166
We're uneducated people,
we keep on fighting for revenge.

911
01:02:01,167 --> 01:02:04,958
You're educated, you mustn't
develop this vengeance feeling.

912
01:02:05,209 --> 01:02:06,124
So I did like this.

913
01:02:07,584 --> 01:02:11,749
Don't get angry on him
because he beat you.

914
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:13,124
l don't have any hard
feelings, father.

915
01:02:13,375 --> 01:02:14,958
l've always liked him.

916
01:02:15,209 --> 01:02:17,541
Don't you like our food?

917
01:02:17,792 --> 01:02:20,749
No, it's very good.
- Eat son!

918
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,208
Wait son! Have some water.

919
01:02:24,792 --> 01:02:28,583
When our son comes home
once a year,

920
01:02:28,834 --> 01:02:33,374
to feed him properly, we've to ask
neighbours to lend food grains,

921
01:02:34,042 --> 01:02:36,166
that's why he stays in hostel,

922
01:02:36,417 --> 01:02:39,166
he can have food there and
continue studies too,

923
01:02:39,417 --> 01:02:41,166
he's staying there for
the past 5 years,

924
01:02:42,042 --> 01:02:47,999
my son has never fought with
anyone in these 5 years,

925
01:02:49,417 --> 01:02:53,791
don't fight with him son,
it may ruin his life.

926
01:02:54,250 --> 01:02:55,166
Bye son.

927
01:02:59,042 --> 01:03:00,624
Mother wants me to stay back here.

928
01:03:00,875 --> 01:03:02,208
This is for you to eat in hostel,

929
01:03:02,459 --> 01:03:06,208
this lantern if it gets dark
on the way. Go carefully.

930
01:03:06,459 --> 01:03:08,833
Sorry buddy.
- No formalities between us buddy.

931
01:03:11,042 --> 01:03:13,291
PJ, reach hostel before it's dark.

932
01:03:37,125 --> 01:03:37,874
Who is it?

933
01:03:55,084 --> 01:03:56,666
How did you fall down, PJ?

934
01:03:56,917 --> 01:03:59,249
l saw a ghost!
- Did you fall down in fear?

935
01:03:59,500 --> 01:04:02,458
l fell in trying to catch
the running ghost.

936
01:04:03,125 --> 01:04:06,124
l know you'll not believe me.

937
01:04:06,125 --> 01:04:08,291
Okay, take this tablet and
have tea, you'll be fine.

938
01:04:08,542 --> 01:04:12,916
l'll not take local tablets.
- Don't be so affectionate.

939
01:04:13,167 --> 01:04:16,291
Exams are 10 away and
he'll fail and leave this place.

940
01:04:16,542 --> 01:04:19,791
l'll definitely pass.
- He'll definitely pass!

941
01:04:23,750 --> 01:04:28,124
l've decided...l must pass
this exam at any cost.

942
01:04:28,125 --> 01:04:31,291
You will surely!
- But how?

943
01:04:31,542 --> 01:04:34,541
How? A question that must be asked
by opposition is asked by treasury.

944
01:04:34,750 --> 01:04:36,499
You've passed the first year
in city, right PJ?

945
01:04:36,750 --> 01:04:38,124
l paid money to buy pass percentage.

946
01:04:38,375 --> 01:04:41,749
Paper?
- No, one who corrects papers.

947
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,958
3 months are over,
l've not read anything.

948
01:04:44,209 --> 01:04:46,166
How am l to get through this?

949
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,333
Roof is falling!

950
01:04:52,209 --> 01:04:54,166
Cells dying for long period in hot Sun,

951
01:04:54,167 --> 01:04:56,958
shrink in rain,
and it creates fissures...

952
01:04:59,584 --> 01:05:02,333
l'll spend the night here to study.

953
01:05:02,584 --> 01:05:07,374
Kannababu will ensure a bigger
piece will fall on my hand.

954
01:05:07,959 --> 01:05:09,374
lt'll hurt my hand.

955
01:05:09,584 --> 01:05:12,791
And I can't write the exam.
Someone else will take my exam...

956
01:05:15,209 --> 01:05:17,999
Kannababu will write and I'll pass.

957
01:05:18,250 --> 01:05:19,374
Everything will happen.

958
01:05:20,250 --> 01:05:21,874
Then you'll lose your hands.

959
01:05:23,209 --> 01:05:25,791
l think you don't have the
idea of timing.

960
01:05:26,042 --> 01:05:30,041
l'll keep my hand but remove
hands by the time it falls.

961
01:05:30,042 --> 01:05:31,291
That's timing!

962
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,791
Will it fall again with
the same timing?

963
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:43,208
Why again?
lt has fallen already.

964
01:05:47,084 --> 01:05:47,999
Prince!

965
01:05:50,250 --> 01:05:52,041
He thinks this is a plan.

966
01:05:53,250 --> 01:05:53,833
What?

967
01:05:54,084 --> 01:05:54,833
Look here sir.

968
01:05:55,042 --> 01:05:58,208
Your dilapidated college has
ruined my life and my hands.

969
01:05:58,459 --> 01:05:59,208
What happened?

970
01:05:59,459 --> 01:06:04,833
l studied very hard,
l had dreamed to pass,

971
01:06:05,250 --> 01:06:07,208
l can still see the lessons
before my eyes, sir,

972
01:06:07,459 --> 01:06:09,416
but what's the use?
l must getjustice.

973
01:06:09,667 --> 01:06:11,999
lf not I'll launch a fast unto death.

974
01:06:12,250 --> 01:06:14,458
You mean you'll die without
eating food.

975
01:06:14,709 --> 01:06:15,999
You must tell me that before,
what do you call this as?

976
01:06:16,292 --> 01:06:18,041
Peaceful protest!
l'll protest peacefully.

977
01:06:18,042 --> 01:06:19,458
Cancel the earlier one.

978
01:06:20,709 --> 01:06:21,958
What are you planning to do?

979
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:24,124
Someone else will take exam
on my behalf.

980
01:06:24,709 --> 01:06:28,041
But l'll narrate it.
lf not I'll protest.

981
01:06:28,292 --> 01:06:31,249
Who will write for you?
-l'll pass even if any fool writes.

982
01:06:31,500 --> 01:06:33,041
We?
- Not about you.

983
01:06:33,292 --> 01:06:34,666
Kannababu, you write this time.

984
01:06:34,917 --> 01:06:36,249
Okay.
- He'll write for me.

985
01:06:37,084 --> 01:06:39,874
l'll ask the committee and decide.
- Srikrishna Committee?

986
01:06:41,500 --> 01:06:43,041
Why are you poking me for long time?

987
01:06:43,292 --> 01:06:45,458
Some Sharatchandra wants to cry
with you only not with me.

988
01:06:45,709 --> 01:06:47,249
Keep it.
- Take it.

989
01:06:48,084 --> 01:06:48,666
Bloody face!

990
01:06:48,917 --> 01:06:52,083
Hello Sharat! Conditions again?

991
01:06:52,084 --> 01:06:53,916
You guessed it right.
- What?

992
01:06:54,167 --> 01:07:00,083
Your grandpa ordered to open a cover
with conditions after 3 months in college.

993
01:07:00,334 --> 01:07:02,916
You didn't...
- I told you, you would've forgotten.

994
01:07:03,959 --> 01:07:07,124
l know you're playing drama to
see l don't get the property.

995
01:07:07,125 --> 01:07:09,083
l'll kill you!

996
01:07:10,334 --> 01:07:13,083
You want me to tell or cut the line?
Tell me.

997
01:07:13,334 --> 01:07:15,499
What are the new conditions?
- I'm forgiving you this time.

998
01:07:15,750 --> 01:07:18,708
From today you mustn't beat
anyone in college.

999
01:07:18,959 --> 01:07:20,708
l'm not in a position anyway.

1000
01:07:20,959 --> 01:07:21,708
Tell me what's the second condition?

1001
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:27,166
You must become student?s union
president in at least for a year.

1002
01:07:28,584 --> 01:07:34,333
Your nest is shattered...
your heart is broken...

1003
01:07:34,584 --> 01:07:41,541
O little bird, who beat you?

1004
01:07:41,792 --> 01:07:45,333
Committee discussed your request
and has agreed.

1005
01:07:46,209 --> 01:07:50,166
But we'll decide the man who will
take the exam on your behalf.- Who?

1006
01:07:55,042 --> 01:07:56,374
She'll write your exam.

1007
01:07:57,834 --> 01:08:00,999
She can sir.
- She will. She'll write the exam.

1008
01:08:07,042 --> 01:08:10,999
Becoming students union president,
Sindhu writing my exam,

1009
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,166
keep that old man's photo
in my cell before me.

1010
01:08:21,417 --> 01:08:23,791
Grandpa! You've fixed me!

1011
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:25,999
What's that?

1012
01:08:27,042 --> 01:08:29,791
That's interval!
l'll see after it.

1013
01:08:44,667 --> 01:08:47,416
Goddess mother, Praveen is writing
exam today, he's irresponsible,

1014
01:08:47,667 --> 01:08:50,833
he can't do anything properly,
he can't write one word properly.

1015
01:08:51,084 --> 01:08:52,624
He doesn't know anything
other than drinks and girls.

1016
01:08:52,875 --> 01:08:53,833
He's a wastrel.

1017
01:08:54,084 --> 01:08:56,416
He's an idiot,
he's very poor in studies...

1018
01:08:56,667 --> 01:08:58,999
We're not abusing him,
we're telling Goddess about him.

1019
01:08:59,250 --> 01:09:01,041
Goddess, please don't mind his words.

1020
01:09:02,084 --> 01:09:04,624
We were born and brought
up in poverty.

1021
01:09:04,834 --> 01:09:07,833
He was born with money,
he can't live without it.

1022
01:09:08,917 --> 01:09:12,458
Please change Sindhu's mind and
see that she writes exam for him.

1023
01:09:13,709 --> 01:09:15,041
Please don't let him write
the exam, Goddess.

1024
01:09:15,292 --> 01:09:17,041
lf he writes,
he'll not get even a pie.

1025
01:09:17,292 --> 01:09:19,458
We wish he passes this exam, Goddess.

1026
01:09:25,709 --> 01:09:27,041
What are you looking at?

1027
01:09:27,917 --> 01:09:30,874
l had spent few lakhs to know
some are not my friends.

1028
01:09:31,917 --> 01:09:33,874
l was thinking how you all
are different from them.

1029
01:09:34,084 --> 01:09:36,874
According to the...
- Telugu please.

1030
01:09:40,709 --> 01:09:44,124
You must pass.
- Pass.- Pass!

1031
01:09:47,750 --> 01:09:48,916
You must win over this hurdle.

1032
01:10:03,750 --> 01:10:05,499
Looks like you're taking him
to sacrifice!

1033
01:10:05,750 --> 01:10:07,124
No sir, to write exam.

1034
01:10:07,125 --> 01:10:09,083
Something like that only.

1035
01:10:09,334 --> 01:10:10,083
This year, let's rock it.

1036
01:10:14,084 --> 01:10:17,124
This side boy!
Examination hall is this side.

1037
01:10:17,792 --> 01:10:20,541
He's a Ghazni Mohammad.
He has been attempting for years.

1038
01:10:29,209 --> 01:10:30,124
No slips, right?

1039
01:10:30,375 --> 01:10:32,166
With what? With this?

1040
01:10:34,209 --> 01:10:38,124
Sindhu, this exam is my life's...

1041
01:10:39,209 --> 01:10:41,166
Do you know about Shakespeare's Hamlet?

1042
01:10:41,584 --> 01:10:43,749
l know about helmet and omelette.

1043
01:10:44,375 --> 01:10:46,124
You know or not?
- I don't know.

1044
01:10:47,334 --> 01:10:48,541

1045
01:10:48,834 --> 01:10:51,208
l know about Nun who lives
next to Narayana's house.

1046
01:10:51,417 --> 01:10:53,999

1047
01:10:56,250 --> 01:10:57,791
l know about Paradise biryani.

1048
01:10:58,209 --> 01:10:59,166
You...!

1049
01:10:59,417 --> 01:11:00,791
Why did you come to take exam then?

1050
01:11:01,042 --> 01:11:09,041
l can live without anyone but
l can't live without luxuries of life.

1051
01:11:09,042 --> 01:11:11,958
l need money for all that.
lt's okay.

1052
01:11:13,625 --> 01:11:17,666
lf I want all that, you must help me.
You can't avoid it.

1053
01:11:18,584 --> 01:11:19,999
Are you writing all this?

1054
01:11:20,209 --> 01:11:22,583
lt's my duty to write
what ever you say.

1055
01:11:25,875 --> 01:11:27,833
lf I knew she was like this,
l wouldn't have had a fight with her.

1056
01:11:28,042 --> 01:11:29,624
Not you, turn that side.

1057
01:11:29,875 --> 01:11:31,041
l know sir.

1058
01:11:54,875 --> 01:11:55,624
Write!

1059
01:12:05,500 --> 01:12:07,041
Are the exams over?

1060
01:12:07,917 --> 01:12:08,749
When?

1061
01:12:09,125 --> 01:12:12,083
When?! Go to and sleep.

1062
01:12:13,084 --> 01:12:14,166
Let's go, come.

1063
01:12:18,125 --> 01:12:20,458
What's the matter?
- Don't know.- Take it.

1064
01:12:20,917 --> 01:12:23,458
You didn't even offer upma too,
why are you giving sweets now?

1065
01:12:23,709 --> 01:12:25,624
Your time is nearing.

1066
01:12:25,917 --> 01:12:27,041
Our college's record.

1067
01:12:27,042 --> 01:12:29,666
You're the first student to
quit college in 3 months.

1068
01:12:29,959 --> 01:12:30,666
That's why they're distributing sweets.

1069
01:12:34,125 --> 01:12:35,499
Results will be out today.

1070
01:12:36,125 --> 01:12:37,499
Why wait till the paper comes?

1071
01:12:38,167 --> 01:12:40,291
Get his luggage ready at the
door before paper comes..

1072
01:12:41,750 --> 01:12:43,291
Fail?
- Any doubt?

1073
01:12:43,750 --> 01:12:47,374
What happened? Your result is out
and birds have got wings...

1074
01:12:49,125 --> 01:12:50,708
Has Ramana come?

1075
01:12:55,334 --> 01:12:56,708
This is Ramana's cycle bell.

1076
01:13:01,959 --> 01:13:04,333
l can hear a strange
background music.

1077
01:13:04,584 --> 01:13:05,541
You too!

1078
01:13:12,584 --> 01:13:15,166
l feel you've passed seeing
his expression.

1079
01:13:15,167 --> 01:13:17,958
He's an Oscar winner and
his damn expression.

1080
01:13:19,375 --> 01:13:21,833
Sindhu has written the exam.
- But he told the answers.

1081
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,958
Praveen, Rajanna is calling you.

1082
01:13:32,125 --> 01:13:36,374
Looking at his face it's confirmed,
get ready for consoling trip.

1083
01:13:36,584 --> 01:13:37,583
ls that the way you feel?

1084
01:13:37,792 --> 01:13:39,374
Keep quiet.
- What happened?

1085
01:13:39,625 --> 01:13:42,208
How could l pass, buddies?
- It shouldn't happen.

1086
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:54,958
Grandpa!

1087
01:14:00,209 --> 01:14:02,374
You're still PJ!
- I know.

1088
01:14:02,625 --> 01:14:04,791
Sindhu is responsible for this,
thank her.

1089
01:14:07,792 --> 01:14:09,791
Rajanna is next to her.

1090
01:14:10,667 --> 01:14:12,624
Why do you encourage
such cheap products?

1091
01:14:12,875 --> 01:14:13,999
They must be in dust bin.

1092
01:14:15,459 --> 01:14:16,624
l meant about Praveen.

1093
01:14:18,084 --> 01:14:19,041
l got it sir.

1094
01:14:19,042 --> 01:14:21,041
He'll rip your skin if he sees you.

1095
01:14:21,042 --> 01:14:25,833
Teacher will bribe a kid with chocolate
first to get him into the school,

1096
01:14:26,084 --> 01:14:29,416
only then the teacher can know
what the child can learn, right?

1097
01:14:29,667 --> 01:14:33,624
lf you give just 3 months
and tell him to pass or fail,

1098
01:14:34,250 --> 01:14:36,624
where's the time and
chance for him to reform?

1099
01:14:37,667 --> 01:14:42,083
lf PJ is really dull,
he'll fail in the next two years,

1100
01:14:42,500 --> 01:14:45,458
we needn't have to decide
about his place then, sir.

1101
01:14:47,500 --> 01:14:48,874
We needn't have to decide.

1102
01:14:49,917 --> 01:14:50,666
Yes.

1103
01:14:52,709 --> 01:14:55,458
This is for you.
- What's this?

1104
01:14:56,292 --> 01:14:58,041
l don't have the habit of taking
anybody's help freely.

1105
01:14:58,292 --> 01:14:59,874
Will you take your grandpa's wealth?

1106
01:15:00,125 --> 01:15:00,874
That's mine, darling.

1107
01:15:01,125 --> 01:15:02,083
You still haven't yet got it.

1108
01:15:02,084 --> 01:15:04,874
Not your grandpa's,
get anything that you'd earned.

1109
01:15:05,125 --> 01:15:06,083
Why is he here?

1110
01:15:06,500 --> 01:15:08,458
Take it.
- Holding her hand, are you in love?

1111
01:15:08,709 --> 01:15:09,291
Love?

1112
01:15:09,292 --> 01:15:10,541
Sindhu, accept my love.

1113
01:15:10,792 --> 01:15:11,458
Should she accept your love?

1114
01:15:15,167 --> 01:15:17,083
Beat...beat him and forget
all the conditions.

1115
01:15:17,334 --> 01:15:19,083
Forget why you are here!

1116
01:15:19,334 --> 01:15:21,124
Behave always like this in your life.

1117
01:15:21,334 --> 01:15:23,916
No Sindhu...
- Don't talk Ammiraju.

1118
01:15:24,167 --> 01:15:25,291
She's right, don't talk Ammiraju.

1119
01:15:25,542 --> 01:15:28,291
l don't love anyone.
- She's doesn't love anyone.

1120
01:15:28,542 --> 01:15:31,916
l'm free. if you've patience,
try for another 6 months.

1121
01:15:32,167 --> 01:15:34,291
lf you've patience,
try for another 6 months.

1122
01:15:34,542 --> 01:15:36,916
l may fall.
- She may fall.

1123
01:15:37,334 --> 01:15:38,916
Fall? How can you fall for him?

1124
01:15:39,167 --> 01:15:39,916
Keep it with you.

1125
01:15:41,334 --> 01:15:43,124
Where's he?
Did you see my brother-in-law?

1126
01:15:43,125 --> 01:15:45,041
Seen any wine shop here?
- There!

1127
01:15:45,292 --> 01:15:49,166
Hey Mabbu, confused with dialogues,
let's rehearse once.

1128
01:15:49,167 --> 01:15:49,916
You remember your dialogues, right?

1129
01:15:50,209 --> 01:15:51,958
Okay...okay...I'm Yama!

1130
01:15:52,209 --> 01:15:54,958
Yama? You're Duryodhana!

1131
01:15:55,209 --> 01:15:57,958
You must say well said!
- Well said!

1132
01:15:58,209 --> 01:16:00,166
Turn this side.
- I know.

1133
01:16:02,792 --> 01:16:06,541
When did you come, brother-in-law?

1134
01:16:06,792 --> 01:16:08,541
At quarter to nine,
quarter past nine.

1135
01:16:08,792 --> 01:16:12,749
Why is he here at this hour?
- He's drunk.

1136
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:16,124
But still l'll go away.
- Are you escaping?

1137
01:16:16,375 --> 01:16:17,749
He's stinking!

1138
01:16:20,959 --> 01:16:23,208
What's this?
- Drama, play.

1139
01:16:25,250 --> 01:16:26,791
lt's who are you not how you are?

1140
01:16:29,250 --> 01:16:30,791
He looks like a crook, who is he?

1141
01:16:31,042 --> 01:16:31,999
l'm Krishna.

1142
01:16:32,834 --> 01:16:35,999
How many plays you've played?
- About 100 to 200!

1143
01:16:36,250 --> 01:16:39,166
100 or 200, there's 100
difference between them.

1144
01:16:39,417 --> 01:16:40,958
Take it 100 and odd.

1145
01:16:41,834 --> 01:16:45,583
Krishna, select anyone
from the 4000 lovers.

1146
01:16:46,209 --> 01:16:48,999
Then l'll select this girl...

1147
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:53,958
Duryodhana, he dared to touch Sindhu.

1148
01:16:54,417 --> 01:16:57,833
Krishna, take off your crown.
- As you say.

1149
01:17:00,334 --> 01:17:03,833
Why?- Wear the crown now.
- I'll not.

1150
01:17:04,084 --> 01:17:06,999
Krishna, you're not Lord Krishna now.

1151
01:17:07,250 --> 01:17:10,041
Sindhu.
- Tell me, PJ brother-in-law.

1152
01:17:10,667 --> 01:17:16,291
Sindhu, if he has patience
can Ammiraju try you?

1153
01:17:18,459 --> 01:17:22,416
You mustn't beat anyone.
- That's why I'm not beating her.

1154
01:17:22,667 --> 01:17:25,624
Why me?- What's this?
- Drama!

1155
01:17:25,834 --> 01:17:26,791
Well said!

1156
01:17:27,042 --> 01:17:29,249
Did l voluntarily trap myself?

1157
01:17:29,500 --> 01:17:31,458
Who else do l've other
than you, Sindhu?

1158
01:17:31,709 --> 01:17:35,083
PJ brother-in-law.
l don't like this character.

1159
01:17:35,084 --> 01:17:37,083
Give me another character,
l'll rock with my performance.

1160
01:17:37,084 --> 01:17:40,458
Select one finger among the three.

1161
01:17:40,709 --> 01:17:43,458
No girls in it, right?
But still l'll select one.

1162
01:17:45,125 --> 01:17:46,666
There's no danger in
his character, right?

1163
01:17:47,125 --> 01:17:49,041
Do you want Sindhu?

1164
01:17:49,292 --> 01:17:50,249
Why are you asking me
all the questions?

1165
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:52,041
He has played 100 dramas,
won't you ask him?

1166
01:17:52,292 --> 01:17:54,458
You're drunk, don't come to me.

1167
01:17:58,042 --> 01:18:01,458
Select one of these two fingers.

1168
01:18:01,709 --> 01:18:03,499
You'll beat me even if I select, right?

1169
01:18:05,334 --> 01:18:06,708
l'll beat you, even if you don't select.

1170
01:18:06,959 --> 01:18:08,083
Beat me lightly.

1171
01:18:10,125 --> 01:18:12,083
You've respect for Rajanna, right?

1172
01:18:12,959 --> 01:18:14,124
That's for outside world only.

1173
01:18:14,125 --> 01:18:16,083
What's this?
- Drama.

1174
01:18:17,959 --> 01:18:21,083
You and that lawyer tried to
usurp my wealth, right?

1175
01:18:24,959 --> 01:18:27,083
l selected the other finger
in confusion.

1176
01:18:29,125 --> 01:18:30,083
Who is this?

1177
01:18:31,125 --> 01:18:34,333
l don't know this character,
l can't play this.

1178
01:18:35,167 --> 01:18:36,333
l know.

1179
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,749
He has gone out.
Saved from a danger.

1180
01:18:55,792 --> 01:18:58,166
Will you lay conditions, Sharat?

1181
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:01,333
l'll resign.

1182
01:19:01,584 --> 01:19:05,166
You said over 100,
can't do even 4 also?

1183
01:19:06,959 --> 01:19:10,166
Stop! It's wrong to get drunk
and create trouble.

1184
01:19:10,417 --> 01:19:12,999
When did you come, brother-in-law?
- Just now, come.

1185
01:19:14,250 --> 01:19:15,166
Who broke those benches?
Did l do it?

1186
01:19:15,625 --> 01:19:17,874
Those were like this only,
come let's go to the room.

1187
01:19:32,042 --> 01:19:33,166
Sir, I passed the exam.

1188
01:19:33,417 --> 01:19:35,374
Sometimes such mistakes
do happen, go to your seat.

1189
01:19:35,625 --> 01:19:37,374
Bell has been rung, you go.

1190
01:19:37,625 --> 01:19:40,874
Those who don't want will leave.
- He thinks l'll leave.

1191
01:19:42,250 --> 01:19:44,249
People think Telugu will die.

1192
01:19:44,250 --> 01:19:48,624
lf that happens, not me where would
these Telugu teachers go?

1193
01:19:55,084 --> 01:19:59,624
lf the situation makes Telugu to die,
l'll die a day before that happens.

1194
01:20:01,250 --> 01:20:04,416
Our neighbouring state's people
are dying for their language,

1195
01:20:04,667 --> 01:20:06,916
and you wish Telugu to die.

1196
01:20:08,084 --> 01:20:11,833
Telugu isn't getting those 35
marks with great difficulty,

1197
01:20:12,042 --> 01:20:15,999
it's bridge to share ourjoys
and grieves with our mother,

1198
01:20:16,292 --> 01:20:20,041
when you get hurt, you cry shit,

1199
01:20:20,292 --> 01:20:22,249
how can you understand
the greatness of Telugu?

1200
01:20:23,709 --> 01:20:26,874
l'm not here to give
a lecture to you,
l'm here to teach you lessons,

1201
01:20:27,125 --> 01:20:31,041
Write Viswaksena's son is
Taskaskambotlu!

1202
01:20:32,292 --> 01:20:32,874

01:20:37,709 --> 01:20:39,041
l mean 1000 times. Write.

1206
01:20:41,500 --> 01:20:45,041
That PJ...
- No need to details to Adivi Rambabu.

1207
01:20:45,292 --> 01:20:46,833
Just show him to me.

1208
01:20:47,292 --> 01:20:49,083
He's Adivi's man.
- I know.

1209
01:20:49,084 --> 01:20:50,708
How?
- He's Adivi's(forest) man!

1210
01:20:51,334 --> 01:20:53,916
Not like that, l'm Adivi
and he's my man.

1211
01:20:54,167 --> 01:20:56,708
He's Adivi Rambabu's man!
- What's the problem?

1212
01:20:56,959 --> 01:20:59,124
You love that girl,
my man will leave her.

1213
01:21:00,125 --> 01:21:02,916
You leave that girl,
my man will love her.

1214
01:21:03,167 --> 01:21:06,083
Your man must leave the girl he loves,
how can I leave her?- What?

1215
01:21:06,334 --> 01:21:09,916
Look, you must divorce your wife,
how can he divorce her?

1216
01:21:10,167 --> 01:21:11,916
You're right.
- Isn't it? Leave it.

1217
01:21:12,167 --> 01:21:14,291
l'll leave it.
Then, my man?

1218
01:21:14,542 --> 01:21:16,124
He'll leave the girl.
- Then you?

1219
01:21:16,125 --> 01:21:17,291
l'll love the girl.

1220
01:21:17,750 --> 01:21:20,124
What's the problem?
lt's settled. Let's go.

1221
01:21:21,125 --> 01:21:22,541
Will you get confused
if l confuse you?

1222
01:21:22,792 --> 01:21:24,083
Bloody red shirt...

1223
01:21:24,375 --> 01:21:27,124
This is black shirt.

1224
01:21:27,375 --> 01:21:30,124
Red will suit you better, boy.
- Boy?

1225
01:21:30,375 --> 01:21:33,166
l'm Tiger to this place,
are you calling me a boy?

1226
01:21:33,167 --> 01:21:34,749
What's that look?

1227
01:21:36,209 --> 01:21:40,541
l mustn't beat anyone, boy.
- I've carried stones!

1228
01:21:40,792 --> 01:21:42,541
You can't understand the lock
in the screenplay,

1229
01:21:42,792 --> 01:21:46,166
l shouldn't beat anyone.
- What should I understand?
Come on!

1230
01:21:48,792 --> 01:21:50,124
What's the price of pumpkin?
- Rs.50!

1231
01:21:50,375 --> 01:21:52,708
Rs.50?!
Give me for Rs.20!

1232
01:21:52,959 --> 01:21:54,583
Boy, give me the bat.

1233
01:21:55,209 --> 01:21:56,374
Will you play cricket now?

1234
01:21:57,209 --> 01:21:58,583
l can't play.
l know to play.

1235
01:21:58,834 --> 01:22:00,249
Boy, ball please.

1236
01:22:01,625 --> 01:22:02,583
Why?

1237
01:22:02,834 --> 01:22:05,166
Rathamma!
- Rathamma?

1238
01:22:05,417 --> 01:22:07,374
Why will you not give?
- Super boy!

1239
01:22:11,209 --> 01:22:14,374
Who is that? Bloody idiots!

1240
01:22:14,625 --> 01:22:15,791
Wait, I'll take you to task.

1241
01:22:16,042 --> 01:22:19,666
Am I looking so cheap to you?
You're dead today!

1242
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:21,166
Stop there!

1243
01:22:21,417 --> 01:22:25,166
Will you beat me with ball,
you damn fool?

1244
01:22:25,584 --> 01:22:27,749
Why are you getting involved
in love and fights?

1245
01:22:28,209 --> 01:22:29,166
Forget this.

1246
01:22:29,459 --> 01:22:33,208
l've a good plan for you to become the
college president. Just follow it.

1247
01:22:33,459 --> 01:22:35,416
Tell me sir.

1248
01:22:35,667 --> 01:22:38,041
Not now.
- When?

1249
01:22:38,042 --> 01:22:39,833
Tonight.
- Where?

1250
01:22:40,875 --> 01:22:42,833
Temple?
- Near Wines.

1251
01:22:46,875 --> 01:22:49,999
3 quarters have gone down but
matter hasn't come out yet.

1252
01:22:50,250 --> 01:22:52,999
Even 3 more quarters go down,
this is the matter.

1253
01:22:53,875 --> 01:22:54,416
Liquor?

1254
01:22:55,667 --> 01:23:01,041
Find a good occasion and give
everyone a liquor bottle and Rs.500,

1255
01:23:01,042 --> 01:23:03,874
you'll get all the votes.
- Sindhu is the opponent.

1256
01:23:04,125 --> 01:23:05,208
To hell with Sindhu.

1257
01:23:05,500 --> 01:23:07,249
She can't distribute to
so many people.

1258
01:23:07,917 --> 01:23:11,041
But half of the college are girls,
what would they do with bottles?

1259
01:23:11,292 --> 01:23:13,874
They'll give to their father
or boy friend.

1260
01:23:18,292 --> 01:23:19,333
Will it work out?

1261
01:23:20,500 --> 01:23:24,249
60 percent of democracy works
on this principle,

1262
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:27,458
do you've money,
l've a plan for that too.

1263
01:23:27,917 --> 01:23:29,458
No need.
- Where's my drink?

1264
01:23:29,709 --> 01:23:31,874
We need his vote also.
01 23 Distribution started.

1265
01:23:32,125 --> 01:23:34,041
Our votes are yours,
what an idea sir!

1266
01:23:34,042 --> 01:23:38,499
Madam, please give me alms.
Madam, God will bless you.

1267
01:23:40,125 --> 01:23:41,499
Why hasn't come yet?

1268
01:23:43,542 --> 01:23:45,708
Will you give me Rs.5, I'll have a tea.

1269
01:23:45,959 --> 01:23:47,124
Will you have tea for Rs.5?

1270
01:23:47,125 --> 01:23:49,708
l'll give you Rs.25, have a pesticide!
Get lost!

1271
01:23:55,750 --> 01:23:56,499
Why are you so late?

1272
01:23:57,125 --> 01:23:58,499
Did you miss city life?

1273
01:23:58,750 --> 01:24:02,499
New friends, fresh air.
l'm enjoying to the hilt.

1274
01:24:02,750 --> 01:24:03,708
Where's your car?

1275
01:24:03,959 --> 01:24:09,666
Car...village roads are not
that comfortable, so... l came on bike.

1276
01:24:10,125 --> 01:24:12,124
This one?
- Mine.- Take off your hand.

1277
01:24:13,792 --> 01:24:18,541
My friend...he's going out with
family, you can return it later.

1278
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:23,541
Actual matter is l must win
the student election.

1279
01:24:24,584 --> 01:24:29,333
lf I lose, then I've to beg all my life.
- Like me?

1280
01:24:29,584 --> 01:24:32,166
You come here.
- He's a pain!

1281
01:24:34,584 --> 01:24:35,958
l'll kill him.

1282
01:24:36,792 --> 01:24:39,083
l want minimum Rs.5 lakhs.

1283
01:24:40,584 --> 01:24:42,124
l've to distribute today evening.

1284
01:24:42,834 --> 01:24:47,583
Wearing a long skirt and half sari...
Sporting flowers in the tresses...

1285
01:24:47,834 --> 01:24:53,999
Swan necked Shyamala...
- Is here for us only...

1286
01:24:55,042 --> 01:24:56,583
She's dancing for us...

1287
01:25:01,625 --> 01:25:04,166
ls it? Shall I say something now?

1288
01:25:09,625 --> 01:25:12,374
l don't understand what you're
saying brothers-in-law...

1289
01:25:12,625 --> 01:25:15,041
But still greetings to all art lovers...

1290
01:25:15,209 --> 01:25:16,374
Okay, come to the point...

1291
01:25:16,667 --> 01:25:19,041
The colourful top...
Golden rings...

1292
01:25:19,042 --> 01:25:22,624

1293
01:25:28,084 --> 01:25:30,624
Our votes are for Munna only...

01:25:30,875 --> 01:25:33,999
l'll give a rung for every vote

1295
01:25:34,250 --> 01:25:36,833
By evening the counting will start...

1296
01:25:37,084 --> 01:25:39,833
He'll show you the code...

1297
01:25:40,084 --> 01:25:42,833
See your booth and

1298
01:25:43,084 --> 01:25:46,624
Rock with your vote...

1299
01:25:46,834 --> 01:25:56,791
O Shyamala, we'll vote for him...

1300
01:26:11,292 --> 01:26:13,874
Fast beat man!
- Fast beat?

1301
01:26:14,125 --> 01:26:16,041
You mean?
- That beat!

1302
01:26:34,334 --> 01:26:40,083
l was waiting in a bus stop and
saw Lord and fell for him...

1303
01:26:40,334 --> 01:26:46,083
l gave up Bangena King's
dance program for him...

1304
01:26:46,334 --> 01:26:52,124
Coming here I find so many...
l must do something for you...

1305
01:26:52,125 --> 01:26:55,124
Balloon is your only hope
of the future...

1306
01:26:55,125 --> 01:26:57,958
l knew this and have asked you...

1307
01:26:58,209 --> 01:27:01,124
Remember the symbol
and vote for balloon...

1308
01:27:28,834 --> 01:27:32,166
Beat the rhythm of Seema!
- That one!

1309
01:27:32,625 --> 01:27:34,374
Take out the blades!

1310
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:51,958
Why don't you tell what would
you on getting elected?

1311
01:27:52,209 --> 01:27:57,999
lf I win the election,
l'll provide FTV in classrooms...

1312
01:27:58,209 --> 01:28:04,208
lf you get caught with love letter,
l'll argue it's a leave letter...

1313
01:28:04,459 --> 01:28:06,999
l'll remove 'Rakhi' from festivals...

1314
01:28:07,250 --> 01:28:09,999
l'll add a wine shop to
college canteen...

1315
01:28:10,250 --> 01:28:15,999
He's our leader...
no doubt you're a leader...

1316
01:28:16,250 --> 01:28:19,208
Remember the symbol
and vote for balloon...

1317
01:28:56,500 --> 01:28:57,874
Oh no Rajanna!

1318
01:29:10,334 --> 01:29:14,499
For trying to win elections in this way,
l'm disqualifying you,

1319
01:29:14,750 --> 01:29:19,083
and requesting the committee
to elect Sindhu unanimously.- No sir...

1320
01:29:30,125 --> 01:29:35,499
How can l bear if people talk
bad about you from tomorrow?

1321
01:29:35,750 --> 01:29:38,499
Men can never understand a woman.

1322
01:29:39,167 --> 01:29:40,083
Never!

1323
01:29:43,375 --> 01:29:45,166
Why should l understand her heart?

1324
01:29:49,584 --> 01:29:50,416
Where are you going?

1325
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:54,166
Take it easy.

1326
01:29:54,584 --> 01:29:55,541
We're going.

1327
01:29:55,792 --> 01:29:58,958
PJ spent Rs.5 lakhs and
made Sindhu win easily.

1328
01:30:04,167 --> 01:30:06,749
Keep PJ's and throw out all
other student's things.- Okay.

1329
01:30:21,625 --> 01:30:22,583
Get going!

1330
01:30:24,042 --> 01:30:26,583
Rajanna, we don't have anything
to eat in home.

1331
01:30:26,834 --> 01:30:28,374
Please don't ask me to leave.

1332
01:30:28,834 --> 01:30:31,999
We're sorry sir, if my father
comes to know, he'll kill me.

1333
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:33,999
Please forgive us one last time, sir.

1334
01:30:34,625 --> 01:30:36,958
We've come this far unable
to live there,

1335
01:30:37,209 --> 01:30:40,958
we don't have money
to go home too. We'll not go.

1336
01:30:41,209 --> 01:30:43,166
PJ committed the mistake,
why are you asking us to leave?

1337
01:30:43,417 --> 01:30:45,583
What was his mistake?
He's a useless wastrel!

1338
01:30:45,834 --> 01:30:47,749
He did what I thought he would do.

1339
01:30:48,042 --> 01:30:50,916
l was correct in judging him.
l don't have any regrets.

1340
01:30:51,459 --> 01:30:53,416
But l trusted you all.

1341
01:30:54,084 --> 01:30:55,624
You've made me bow
my head in shame.

1342
01:30:56,250 --> 01:30:57,208
You keep quiet.

1343
01:31:00,250 --> 01:31:03,041
Please go away, go!
- We'll not go sir.

1344
01:31:03,667 --> 01:31:07,041
Don't say like that Rajanna,
thought we were doing for a friend,

1345
01:31:07,042 --> 01:31:08,833
now after seeing tears in your eyes,
we've understood,

1346
01:31:09,084 --> 01:31:10,041
what a grave mistake we've committed!

1347
01:31:10,042 --> 01:31:14,208
Sir, let anyone say anything,
we'll behave like your students.

1348
01:31:14,459 --> 01:31:15,833
We'll not change.

1349
01:31:16,084 --> 01:31:18,999
l love my father,
l swear on my father, sir.

1350
01:31:19,250 --> 01:31:21,624
Wrong, don't swear on him.

1351
01:31:23,292 --> 01:31:26,249
Just one dirty slush ditch is enough
to spoil a team of achievers.

1352
01:31:28,292 --> 01:31:33,666
lf I see you again with him,
don't dare come before me.

1353
01:31:35,292 --> 01:31:37,874
Go, eat something and
go to sleep.

1354
01:31:48,292 --> 01:31:50,666
Get up...get up...

1355
01:32:27,084 --> 01:32:31,541
Looking at the bright Brahmin boy,
it seems so said the people...

1356
01:32:31,792 --> 01:32:34,958
Hey Kannababu! Where's your director?

1357
01:32:35,209 --> 01:32:40,124
Arrogant, wager, drunkard,
useless, man without any talent.

1358
01:32:40,375 --> 01:32:42,333
How can he dare come to the class?

1359
01:32:45,209 --> 01:32:46,958
He would've got drunk
and fallen somewhere.

1360
01:32:47,209 --> 01:32:48,541
lt seems so said the people...

1361
01:32:55,209 --> 01:32:56,166
Hey boy!

1362
01:32:57,375 --> 01:32:58,749
Come here!

1363
01:32:59,167 --> 01:32:59,916
What?

1364
01:33:00,209 --> 01:33:03,166
Please don't call him.
- I'm talking to him, right? Shut up.

1365
01:33:04,834 --> 01:33:06,208
Come here.

1366
01:33:12,417 --> 01:33:13,374
Come.

1367
01:33:13,834 --> 01:33:19,791
No! As a girl...
- School is closed for rain,

1368
01:33:20,042 --> 01:33:21,999
can you take us home without
our books getting wet?

1369
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,249
Don't do it for free,
tell us how much you want?

1370
01:33:25,625 --> 01:33:27,166
No need, come.

1371
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,791
He's smiling at you.
- No problem.

1372
01:33:37,250 --> 01:33:40,416
Warden will scold if she sees him.
- I'll manage.

1373
01:33:42,042 --> 01:33:43,208
Shut up!

1374
01:33:50,875 --> 01:33:52,999
Let's meet again, please stay here.

1375
01:33:57,042 --> 01:33:58,208
Come quickly!

1376
01:34:04,084 --> 01:34:08,041
Praveen, don't get wet in rain.
Come in.

1377
01:34:09,500 --> 01:34:12,666
Mother!
- Come in son!

1378
01:34:13,084 --> 01:34:16,041
Please listen to me, son.
Come in.

1379
01:34:16,292 --> 01:34:18,249
Don't get wet in rain,
you'll catch cold.

1380
01:34:18,500 --> 01:34:19,083
Come in quickly son.

1381
01:34:26,084 --> 01:34:29,249
Don't get wet, you'll catch cold, son.

1382
01:34:29,500 --> 01:34:31,249
Don't get wet in rain.

1383
01:34:37,917 --> 01:34:40,083
Father, I'll go out to play.
- Stop!

1384
01:34:40,084 --> 01:34:41,083
l'll go out, please tell him, mother.

1385
01:34:41,334 --> 01:34:44,708
How many times l've told you
not to be mischievous?

1386
01:34:45,125 --> 01:34:46,291
This many times!

1387
01:34:46,542 --> 01:34:48,499
Grandpa doesn't like being mischievous.

1388
01:34:48,750 --> 01:34:51,499
l did a mischievous thing and
grandpa threw me out of home.

1389
01:34:51,750 --> 01:34:53,083
ls marrying me a mischievous thing?

1390
01:34:53,334 --> 01:34:54,708
Keep quiet, Gayathri.

1391
01:34:54,959 --> 01:34:57,083
We've got a message from
grandpa after many years.

1392
01:34:57,334 --> 01:35:00,291
You mustn't do any
mischief there, son.- Okay father.

1393
01:35:00,959 --> 01:35:05,291
Praveen, you must be a good man
like your grandpa and father.

1394
01:35:05,542 --> 01:35:06,499
Okay mother.

1395
01:35:08,542 --> 01:35:13,124
lt was major accident, heavy blood loss.
Difficult to survive.

1396
01:35:41,375 --> 01:35:44,541
Are you leaving PJ?
Rajanna gave this box to you.

1397
01:35:46,167 --> 01:35:47,124
What's this?

1398
01:35:48,584 --> 01:35:49,958
Okay, bye.

1399
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:15,166
My dear Praveen, I may not live
when you're 18,

1400
01:36:15,417 --> 01:36:19,583
your father came to study in this
college leaving kingdom and wealth,

1401
01:36:20,792 --> 01:36:24,416
life, friends who give real happiness
and good men,

1402
01:36:24,667 --> 01:36:26,249
he said he met here only,

1403
01:36:26,250 --> 01:36:31,041
leaving me among the hypocrites
and false men,

1404
01:36:31,042 --> 01:36:31,999
he stayed back here only.

1405
01:36:32,250 --> 01:36:34,999
Your mother met your
father here only.

1406
01:36:35,250 --> 01:36:37,999
They married against my wish.

1407
01:36:38,250 --> 01:36:43,208
That's why l threw him out of home
and tried to take revenge on him.

1408
01:36:43,459 --> 01:36:45,624
By the time my temper cooled down
and good sense prevailed,

1409
01:36:45,875 --> 01:36:48,208
God took them away from me,

1410
01:36:49,459 --> 01:36:52,041
to correct the mistake I did,

1411
01:36:52,250 --> 01:36:56,999
l wished you to study in the same
college where your father studied,

1412
01:36:57,292 --> 01:37:02,458
l wanted to you to get the same life and
experience which your father got here,

1413
01:37:02,709 --> 01:37:08,666
to run well our kingdom and
factories that supports 40000 people,

1414
01:37:08,917 --> 01:37:14,041
l thought it was correct on my part to
make you a leader of 400 students,

1415
01:37:14,292 --> 01:37:19,874
that's why l insisted you must
become students union president,

1416
01:37:20,500 --> 01:37:27,624
my wish is you must get the happiness
and live fully what l had missed.

1417
01:37:27,875 --> 01:37:29,124
yours lovingly grandpa.

1418
01:37:58,542 --> 01:37:59,916
Call me as uncle!

1419
01:38:05,125 --> 01:38:07,749
Why didn't you tell me sir?
- What am I to tell you?

1420
01:38:08,584 --> 01:38:12,166
You're just a kid compared to
your father's stubbornness.

1421
01:38:12,792 --> 01:38:16,166
When were studying together,
it took me an year to understand him,

1422
01:38:16,167 --> 01:38:18,041
you're here for three months only,

1423
01:38:18,209 --> 01:38:20,208
neither you nor your father
don't listen to words,

1424
01:38:22,375 --> 01:38:25,333
calm down boy!

1425
01:38:25,792 --> 01:38:27,124
Don't cry. What's this?

1426
01:38:27,375 --> 01:38:29,749
l'll go away, uncle.
- Where?

1427
01:38:30,167 --> 01:38:31,749
To some place.

1428
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:35,124
l'm feeling guilt, uncle,
l fear losing.

1429
01:38:38,417 --> 01:38:39,583
Mad boy!

1430
01:38:39,834 --> 01:38:40,999
What's in victory?

1431
01:38:41,250 --> 01:38:43,583
lt may introduce you to the world.

1432
01:38:43,834 --> 01:38:45,249
Lose once!

1433
01:38:46,834 --> 01:38:48,791
You'll understand the world!

1434
01:38:49,042 --> 01:38:53,583
Go, stop thinking and go to sleep.
Let's discuss tomorrow.

1435
01:38:55,417 --> 01:38:56,166
Go!

1436
01:39:14,042 --> 01:39:17,999
Are you swimming, Ammiraju?
- No, just working.

1437
01:39:20,250 --> 01:39:24,041
Are you arranging dance
program in village festival?

1438
01:39:24,042 --> 01:39:26,624
We've to, do you know any dancer?

1439
01:39:26,875 --> 01:39:29,999
We're ignorant, look there,
a man is coming!

1440
01:39:30,459 --> 01:39:33,624
He arranged the dance program
in Mangamma college. Ask him.

1441
01:39:33,875 --> 01:39:36,208
Will you arrange a program for us too?

1442
01:39:37,042 --> 01:39:39,833
ls it college or a Harlem?

1443
01:39:40,084 --> 01:39:41,458
You've come from outside and
spoiling the reputation of this village.

1444
01:39:41,709 --> 01:39:42,999
Bloody idiot! May you get ruined!

1445
01:39:43,250 --> 01:39:45,083
Arrange a dance program again.

1446
01:39:46,500 --> 01:39:48,083
What's that look! Go!

1447
01:40:01,125 --> 01:40:04,666
Are you there Ammiraju?
- Ammiraju? I'm also here, come in.

1448
01:40:08,917 --> 01:40:11,249
Somebody bashed us with a mask.
- Who is he?

1449
01:40:11,917 --> 01:40:13,833
Tell me the truth, Paidi.
You beat me under the mask.

1450
01:40:14,084 --> 01:40:15,041
He bashed me too.

1451
01:40:15,959 --> 01:40:17,041
l'm sure it's him.

1452
01:40:17,542 --> 01:40:19,083
Somebody bashed me!

1453
01:40:19,292 --> 01:40:24,124
Who beat PJ's man?
- If I beat them, who beat the others?

1454
01:40:28,542 --> 01:40:30,083
We knew you went to beat them.

1455
01:40:31,167 --> 01:40:33,124
lf you beat them they'll suspect you,

1456
01:40:33,125 --> 01:40:34,916
so we too joined and
bashed few others.

1457
01:40:35,167 --> 01:40:36,499
They shouldn't suspect us, right?

1458
01:40:36,750 --> 01:40:38,291
That's why we acted like
we got beaten up.

1459
01:40:38,542 --> 01:40:39,916
You stop it boys!

1460
01:40:42,125 --> 01:40:43,291
Do you drink?

1461
01:40:47,084 --> 01:40:51,291
l didn't say l'll not drink
because l don't drink,

1462
01:40:51,584 --> 01:40:54,333
this is very worse thing,
it'll make you tell the truth,

1463
01:40:54,584 --> 01:40:57,541
let's open ourselves
with some harsh truths. Hold this.

1464
01:40:57,792 --> 01:41:01,958
Can't we do at least on thing
honestly for ourselves, PJ?

1465
01:41:02,209 --> 01:41:06,749
Can you call yourself good man by
buying votes with money and drinks?

1466
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:11,749
Basically people like that I mean
like you get honoured in public.

1467
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:16,333
But no father will ever make
you a role model for his son.

1468
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:20,541
Do one thing honestly.
We're waiting for it.

1469
01:41:20,750 --> 01:41:22,791
The place we hung our
heads in shame,

1470
01:41:23,042 --> 01:41:27,374
we must walking tall with head
held high in that same place, PJ.

1471
01:41:28,042 --> 01:41:29,999
Yes, no need of these short cuts.

1472
01:41:30,250 --> 01:41:31,999
Leader is one who is
adored by people.

1473
01:41:32,250 --> 01:41:34,166
Do something helpful to people
and take them along with you.

1474
01:41:34,417 --> 01:41:37,166
Please don't become lonely.
- What should I do?

1475
01:41:41,042 --> 01:41:41,791
What is this mean?

1476
01:41:43,209 --> 01:41:43,791
You mean?

1477
01:41:44,042 --> 01:41:46,166
Pilla Jamindar Student Force!

1478
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:49,999
You lead us, we'll follow you.

1479
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:51,583
Okay?
- Yes.

1480
01:41:59,667 --> 01:42:04,624
We all know Praveen withdrew from
elections due to a small mistake,

1481
01:42:04,875 --> 01:42:10,999
but Martin Luther King said no need of
power to know the problems of students.

1482
01:42:11,250 --> 01:42:13,624
Please say it in Telugu!

1483
01:42:13,875 --> 01:42:15,833
That's what we too say,
that's our opinion too.

1484
01:42:16,084 --> 01:42:18,041
Tell us your problems, we'll solve it.

1485
01:42:18,042 --> 01:42:20,624
Warming up from now to win next year.

1486
01:42:22,084 --> 01:42:23,833
There's a problem in our college,
can you solve it?

1487
01:42:24,084 --> 01:42:26,624
Tell me, what ever it is,
l'll solve it in seconds.

1488
01:42:26,834 --> 01:42:31,083
That's you! lf you quit college,
problem will be solved. Let's go!

1489
01:42:31,084 --> 01:42:34,666
Please stop!
Please sit down. Please sit down.

1490
01:42:35,125 --> 01:42:36,041
Give us one opportunity.

1491
01:42:36,292 --> 01:42:37,458
How can we give?

1492
01:42:37,709 --> 01:42:38,666
Half yearly exams start
from next week,

1493
01:42:38,917 --> 01:42:40,041
syllabus hasn't yet been completed,

1494
01:42:40,292 --> 01:42:44,874
science teacher and Uddhandapindam
are fighting to become Vice Principal.

1495
01:42:45,125 --> 01:42:49,041
lf possible try to get them
back to the classes.

1496
01:42:50,292 --> 01:42:53,458
We're telling you because science
teacher shares drinks with you.

1497
01:42:53,709 --> 01:42:54,666
Do it,

1498
01:42:54,917 --> 01:42:57,041
we'll then decide to trust
you or not, come girls.

1499
01:43:03,292 --> 01:43:06,083
Present principal and the earlier
principal are my old students.

1500
01:43:06,334 --> 01:43:08,291
l'm retiring in 2 years.

1501
01:43:08,542 --> 01:43:10,124
Am I wrong in aspiring to
become vice principal?

1502
01:43:10,125 --> 01:43:12,916
There's no science without me.

1503
01:43:13,167 --> 01:43:15,291
There's no college without science.

1504
01:43:16,167 --> 01:43:21,916
ln this situation why shouldn't
l become vice principal?

1505
01:43:23,542 --> 01:43:25,583
l'll tell if you promise not
to beat me.- Tell me.

1506
01:43:26,334 --> 01:43:28,916
Lecturers and committee is
breaking their heads,

1507
01:43:29,167 --> 01:43:31,708
over selecting one of you
as the vice principal.

1508
01:43:31,959 --> 01:43:33,958
lf you reject me, l'll stop.

1509
01:43:34,125 --> 01:43:36,083
You must teach Telugu
to an empty college.

1510
01:43:36,334 --> 01:43:37,958
Go, as if you're teaching
in English now.

1511
01:43:38,209 --> 01:43:39,499
You've to teach science
also in Telugu only.

1512
01:43:39,792 --> 01:43:43,541
Why are you surprised?
This fool is also my former student.

1513
01:43:44,375 --> 01:43:48,166
So students will decide who will
be the next vice principal.

1514
01:43:48,167 --> 01:43:49,124
Through votes.

1515
01:43:49,792 --> 01:43:51,541
How did you get such a great idea?

1516
01:43:51,792 --> 01:43:53,958
This is due medical chemical
imbalance...- Stop!

1517
01:43:54,209 --> 01:43:56,541
You said leader is one who
is adored by people.

1518
01:43:57,209 --> 01:43:58,541
ls it okay to you?
- Okay to me.

1519
01:43:58,792 --> 01:43:59,958
Are you ready master?

1520
01:44:01,375 --> 01:44:02,124
We're going for voting!

1521
01:44:02,375 --> 01:44:06,749
But while voting, please write on the
backside why you're voting for him.

1522
01:44:06,959 --> 01:44:08,124
Are you ready to vote?

1523
01:44:11,834 --> 01:44:18,499
Sir, my fathers, my grandfathers,
great grandfathers,

1524
01:44:19,625 --> 01:44:20,791
without having food,

1525
01:44:21,042 --> 01:44:24,791
eating gruel, I mean drinking gruel,
worked for you,

1526
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:25,999
will you beat with a slipper?

1527
01:44:26,417 --> 01:44:27,166
Sir!

1528
01:44:28,834 --> 01:44:31,791
Who is he?
Who gave this role to him?

1529
01:44:32,042 --> 01:44:33,583
You gave him the role.

1530
01:44:33,834 --> 01:44:35,583
How can l do the work I can't do?

1531
01:44:35,834 --> 01:44:38,166
ls this the way you say with feeling
when the boss beats with slipper?

1532
01:44:38,417 --> 01:44:41,666
Dialogue must come from
heart not from mouth.

1533
01:44:42,209 --> 01:44:45,833
All these years l've been working
very hard for you,

1534
01:44:46,084 --> 01:44:48,416
you were abusing me wildly in
the arrogance of money power,

1535
01:44:48,667 --> 01:44:50,833
and beating me like a beast
without treating me as a human,

1536
01:44:51,084 --> 01:44:52,833
my stomach is burning,

1537
01:44:53,042 --> 01:44:55,208
and that fire must be
seen in your eyes.

1538
01:45:03,459 --> 01:45:08,041
Raja sir, l raised you from
childhood on my shoulders,

1539
01:45:11,667 --> 01:45:12,999
whether you pissed on me
or called me informally,

1540
01:45:13,250 --> 01:45:14,999
l took it easily thinking
you're our boy,

1541
01:45:15,250 --> 01:45:17,083
this old man, before everyone,

1542
01:45:18,292 --> 01:45:21,458
will you beat with a slipper?

1543
01:45:25,084 --> 01:45:31,249
ls this boss' arrogance?

1544
01:45:36,084 --> 01:45:38,874
PJ! Put down the chair,
this is just a play.

1545
01:45:39,125 --> 01:45:42,041
Excellent PJ!
Very good!

1546
01:45:42,292 --> 01:45:44,083
You changed the dialogue.
l don't mind.

1547
01:45:44,084 --> 01:45:45,874
Your performance was amazing!

1548
01:45:46,125 --> 01:45:47,249
You turned the scene effective.

1549
01:45:47,459 --> 01:45:48,458
This is what I want.

1550
01:45:48,709 --> 01:45:51,083
You did a wonderful job, Praveen.
Did you practice well?

1551
01:45:51,334 --> 01:45:55,916
No madam, I used to behave
like that earlier.

1552
01:45:56,167 --> 01:45:58,124
l didn't know the other man's
feelings then.

1553
01:45:59,125 --> 01:46:00,708
l'm getting to know it now.

1554
01:46:08,125 --> 01:46:09,916
Science teacher won in the voting.

1555
01:46:12,542 --> 01:46:14,124
We knew you'll win, sir.

1556
01:46:14,125 --> 01:46:16,499
Why are you standing here?
People are waiting for you.

1557
01:46:17,959 --> 01:46:21,291
l'm thinking of dying.
- Why sir?

1558
01:46:21,500 --> 01:46:27,333
l thought l was admired as a man
for my drinking habit.

1559
01:46:27,584 --> 01:46:29,749
See, what the students think about me.

1560
01:46:31,167 --> 01:46:34,166
Sir, you're a great lecturer
in your subject.

1561
01:46:34,167 --> 01:46:39,958
But when you come to class after smoking,
we've to bear the stench to hear you.

1562
01:46:41,375 --> 01:46:46,541
l felt very sad to call you as science
lecturer seeing you drunken on road.

1563
01:46:49,167 --> 01:46:51,124
l can understand well when you teach,

1564
01:46:51,375 --> 01:46:56,999
but we don't know why your hands
explores us in different places?

1565
01:46:57,250 --> 01:46:58,999
But still we want the
science you teach.

1566
01:46:59,250 --> 01:47:02,208
The voted because they need me.

1567
01:47:02,209 --> 01:47:03,374
They don't like me.

1568
01:47:03,625 --> 01:47:06,208
All of them know my negative qualities,

1569
01:47:06,209 --> 01:47:07,583
l can't be the vice principal.

1570
01:47:11,209 --> 01:47:13,791
As a senior and as a good man,

1571
01:47:14,042 --> 01:47:15,791
Uddhandam must be
the vice principal.

1572
01:47:16,042 --> 01:47:17,958
PJ, Uddhandam is seriously ill.

1573
01:47:31,084 --> 01:47:34,499
He was like my father.
Doctor says no hope.

1574
01:47:35,250 --> 01:47:36,833
Can he take it or not?

1575
01:47:37,250 --> 01:47:38,999
What happened?
- Sir,

1576
01:47:39,250 --> 01:47:43,833
he got excited after losing to you.

1577
01:47:44,042 --> 01:47:46,999
He felt breathlessness,

1578
01:47:48,084 --> 01:47:53,041
l've always seen him as very active,
and a teacher who beats,

1579
01:47:53,042 --> 01:47:54,833
never seen him lying on bed,

1580
01:47:56,875 --> 01:47:58,833
go and meet him.

1581
01:48:06,292 --> 01:48:08,083
We're responsible for it.

1582
01:48:08,084 --> 01:48:10,041
We wrote on the backside
of the vote,

1583
01:48:10,292 --> 01:48:11,458
we're like your grand daughters,

1584
01:48:11,709 --> 01:48:15,041
why do you beat us also?
Why are you so angry?

1585
01:48:15,292 --> 01:48:16,041
Calm down children.

1586
01:48:16,292 --> 01:48:21,666
Who is he? Why did he go for
voting and brought death on him?

1587
01:48:22,125 --> 01:48:25,666
lt was my mistake, master.
You won!

1588
01:48:26,084 --> 01:48:28,666
You're our college's vice principal.

1589
01:48:29,500 --> 01:48:31,041
Get up master!

1590
01:48:46,334 --> 01:48:47,916
You promised us, sir.

1591
01:48:48,334 --> 01:48:51,124
You'll die a day before Telugu dies.

1592
01:48:51,750 --> 01:48:54,291
We'll not let Telugu to die, sir.
You too sir.

1593
01:48:57,167 --> 01:48:58,708
l'm responsible for this.

1594
01:48:59,542 --> 01:49:02,916
l'll never again do like this.

1595
01:49:13,375 --> 01:49:14,749
Sir, again...

1596
01:49:19,375 --> 01:49:23,166
Say again not again.

1597
01:49:27,375 --> 01:49:32,541
l always pronounce it like that only sir.
Beat me sir...beat me...

1598
01:49:35,584 --> 01:49:38,958
No, I'll never beat anyone again.

1599
01:49:39,375 --> 01:49:41,749
l'll control my anger.

1600
01:49:42,375 --> 01:49:44,041
Hey science crow!

1601
01:49:44,209 --> 01:49:46,166
You're the vice principal.

1602
01:49:47,417 --> 01:49:51,374
No sir, science is available
on internet,

1603
01:49:51,625 --> 01:49:53,583
but teacher like you must
teach us civility.

1604
01:49:54,834 --> 01:49:56,791
Lead us for sometime.

1605
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:15,208
With this incident PJ has got
a good name in college.

1606
01:50:15,417 --> 01:50:18,624
he's planning to become college
president with this name.

1607
01:50:18,834 --> 01:50:22,208
lf he becomes the president,
it isn't good for me and Sindhu.

1608
01:50:22,459 --> 01:50:25,041
Our caste people dominate
the college,

1609
01:50:25,042 --> 01:50:26,208
how can he get the votes?
- Yes.

1610
01:50:26,459 --> 01:50:30,999
You're the one who can stop him
from becoming the president.- How?

1611
01:50:31,250 --> 01:50:34,041
You're not Ammiraju but Drumraju!

1612
01:50:34,042 --> 01:50:37,208
You contest the next year's election.
- You've won already.

1613
01:50:37,459 --> 01:50:41,208
Ammiraju has won!

1614
01:50:41,459 --> 01:50:44,624
lt seems Ammiraju is contesting
the next elections.

1615
01:50:44,875 --> 01:50:48,208
Let him contest but we mustn't allow
him to become the president.

1616
01:50:48,459 --> 01:50:51,666
You fool, in the village,
mandal level elections...

1617
01:50:51,875 --> 01:50:53,083
l didn't get you man.

1618
01:50:53,084 --> 01:50:55,666
He has caste support and stamp of local.

1619
01:50:55,917 --> 01:50:59,083
We must think smartly and
turn them to support us.

1620
01:50:59,084 --> 01:51:01,666
lt means the use could be
from other place,

1621
01:51:01,917 --> 01:51:04,249
we sow seeds in the ground,

1622
01:51:04,500 --> 01:51:06,249
and pluck the fruits from
the branches,

1623
01:51:06,500 --> 01:51:09,041
like putting on the switch there
to make the bulb light up here.

1624
01:51:16,125 --> 01:51:17,249
Fill it with sand.

1625
01:51:17,500 --> 01:51:19,249
Add sand and blue metal at 3:5 ratio.

1626
01:51:19,500 --> 01:51:21,041
You're students,
why are you doing this work?

1627
01:51:23,125 --> 01:51:27,708
Ammiraju is local, we can't get
support unless we earn good name.

1628
01:51:27,959 --> 01:51:31,124
lf parents put the switch at home,
students in college will vote for us.

1629
01:51:31,125 --> 01:51:34,124
What if the bulb is burnt? l said if.

1630
01:51:35,334 --> 01:51:38,291
Not me, watch out the tractor.
Come...come...

1631
01:51:38,542 --> 01:51:40,499
Move...
- He's coming.

1632
01:51:46,542 --> 01:51:47,291
Move!

1633
01:51:47,750 --> 01:51:50,499
Appi, you've failed and
college students have passed.

1634
01:51:58,959 --> 01:52:00,124
What's this?

1635
01:52:00,584 --> 01:52:02,124
Stop and proceed

1636
01:52:02,375 --> 01:52:04,124
Switch?

1637
01:52:23,584 --> 01:52:28,333
Siripuram Past - Siripuram Welcomes!

1638
01:52:32,625 --> 01:52:35,208
How dare you hit the buffaloes in
the centre and escape!

1639
01:52:35,209 --> 01:52:37,208
l'll take you to task.

1640
01:52:37,209 --> 01:52:40,208
What can you do?
We'll not bring the bus into the village.

1641
01:52:48,209 --> 01:52:50,166
Let it get dark, you'll know it.

1642
01:52:50,417 --> 01:52:51,999
Lamps on buffaloes!

1643
01:52:54,625 --> 01:52:57,166
Take head on, stand up
and be counted...

1644
01:52:59,417 --> 01:53:01,791
Fighter will never give up...

1645
01:53:09,084 --> 01:53:13,624
lf you've a single minded aim,
defeat will have to surrender...

1646
01:53:13,875 --> 01:53:18,208
Take little faltering steps,
raise on your own when you fall down...

1647
01:53:18,459 --> 01:53:23,208
You've to march towards your
aim facing many hurdles...

1648
01:53:23,459 --> 01:53:28,208
lf there's no light,
even Sun is cheap to everyone...

1649
01:53:28,459 --> 01:53:33,041
lf the darkness takes over,
the moonlight gets dull...

1650
01:53:33,042 --> 01:53:37,666
lf you know your true strength,
there's no one to stop you...

1651
01:53:37,875 --> 01:53:42,458
Like sunlight of sun,
like the pleasantness of moon...

1652
01:53:42,709 --> 01:53:47,666
Like a student in progress,
get going silently and firmly...

1653
01:53:57,292 --> 01:54:00,041
Greetings! I'm your Ammiraju.

1654
01:54:00,709 --> 01:54:02,874
Tell your children to vote for me.

1655
01:54:03,125 --> 01:54:04,083
We'll get all the votes of this place.

1656
01:54:04,084 --> 01:54:07,041
We were watching serials,
why did you stop to canvas for votes?

1657
01:54:07,292 --> 01:54:10,499
lf you stop it once again,
l'll beat you with broom. Get lost!

1658
01:54:10,750 --> 01:54:12,708
Why are you talking to
this dirty man, sister?

1659
01:54:12,959 --> 01:54:15,083
Theyjust poured,
thank God, didn't bash us.

1660
01:54:53,792 --> 01:54:58,124
Clench your fist...
opportunities galore...

1661
01:54:58,375 --> 01:55:02,958
lmpossible will bow to you
seeking your forgiveness...

1662
01:55:03,209 --> 01:55:07,749
Earth will not rest thinking
the world has a tomorrow...

1663
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:12,541
lt keeps on rotating steadily
and firmly...

1664
01:55:12,792 --> 01:55:17,124
Your dream will come true
if you make a try...

1665
01:55:17,417 --> 01:55:22,374
You'll become the role model
if you've good behaviour...

1666
01:55:41,417 --> 01:55:42,374
How to make girls fall for us?

1667
01:55:42,625 --> 01:55:45,583
Either one must become
Siddharth or Lord Krishna.

1668
01:55:45,834 --> 01:55:49,999
Becoming Siddharth is difficult
but Lord Krishna...

1669
01:55:52,250 --> 01:55:53,624
l think he has upset his stomach.

1670
01:56:00,042 --> 01:56:01,416
Lord Krishna!

1671
01:56:01,667 --> 01:56:04,624
l'm Ammiraju not Lord Krishna.

1672
01:56:05,250 --> 01:56:06,833
Will you vote for me?

1673
01:56:07,084 --> 01:56:09,624
Should we vote for you? Come!

1674
01:56:10,667 --> 01:56:11,416
What happened to you?

1675
01:56:11,667 --> 01:56:13,624
Hey Ammiraju! Did you act in play?

1676
01:56:33,917 --> 01:56:35,666
Boy! Are you in PJ's party?

1677
01:56:35,917 --> 01:56:38,041
Not his party, l'm Ammiraju's supporter.

1678
01:56:38,292 --> 01:56:41,666
ls it? You're sure to lick my family's name.

1679
01:56:41,917 --> 01:56:42,666
Your family's name? What's it?

1680
01:56:42,917 --> 01:56:45,874
Sanka! (armpit)
- Sanka?

1681
01:56:52,500 --> 01:56:54,666
Life is very small...

1682
01:56:54,875 --> 01:56:57,083
Won't we leave this world...

1683
01:56:57,084 --> 01:57:01,916
Can we carry these dreams
or fame again...

1684
01:57:02,167 --> 01:57:06,708
Goal is born from your imagination...
journeying towards it is yourjob...

1685
01:57:06,959 --> 01:57:11,499
Journey is the lifeline to
every victory and every turn..

1686
01:57:11,750 --> 01:57:16,291
Won't every day be a new year
if every dawn is yours...

1687
01:57:16,542 --> 01:57:21,083
You'll create a sensation
if you show your talent...

1688
01:58:08,625 --> 01:58:09,791
Village Mediacl Camp
Siripuram PJSF

1689
01:58:20,417 --> 01:58:22,166
l hate human and their sweat.

1690
01:58:27,209 --> 01:58:31,791
Everything is for votes, right?
- No, for my girl friend.

1691
01:58:32,625 --> 01:58:34,374
For my 90 year old girl friend.

1692
01:58:35,875 --> 01:58:37,833
l've started liking you recently,
don't know why but it's true.

1693
01:58:38,250 --> 01:58:40,374
l want to talk to you.

1694
01:58:41,667 --> 01:58:43,416
What's it?
- Not now.

1695
01:58:43,667 --> 01:58:44,624
Ammi, it seems not now.

1696
01:58:44,875 --> 01:58:47,624
PJ has changed a lot,
l'll vote for him only.

1697
01:58:47,875 --> 01:58:49,999
My father too told me to elect him.
- Take...

1698
01:58:50,459 --> 01:58:54,416
Notjust your father, entire village is
discussing it like general election.

1699
01:58:54,667 --> 01:58:57,999
l don't mind if you don't vote to me,
but please don't vote to PJ.

1700
01:58:58,250 --> 01:59:00,999
Don't vote to PJ!

1701
01:59:01,250 --> 01:59:02,833
What happened to you, Ammi?

1702
01:59:03,084 --> 01:59:05,208
Why are you telling about him
instead of yourself?- Go man!

1703
01:59:05,667 --> 01:59:07,041
Don't vote to PJ!

1704
01:59:07,042 --> 01:59:09,666
Poor boy doesn't to get angry also.

1705
01:59:10,709 --> 01:59:13,416
l'm doing a role of rich man
in this year's drama,

1706
01:59:13,709 --> 01:59:16,249
l want good shirts like
the ones PJ wears.

1707
01:59:16,500 --> 01:59:18,874
Have you come with money?
- That's why I've brought PJ.

1708
01:59:19,292 --> 01:59:21,083
You want sir?
- No thanks.

1709
01:59:21,709 --> 01:59:23,249
Did you see?

1710
01:59:23,500 --> 01:59:26,041
Did you but this T-shirt here?

1711
01:59:26,292 --> 01:59:28,458
No uncle, where did you buy it?

1712
01:59:28,709 --> 01:59:29,458
l think its London.

1713
01:59:29,709 --> 01:59:31,083
lt seems London,
l mean another country.

1714
01:59:31,084 --> 01:59:33,249
How much?
- May be Rs.3000!

1715
01:59:33,500 --> 01:59:37,041
You got cheated sir! You'll get
3 for Rs.100 only in my shop sir.

1716
01:59:37,292 --> 01:59:39,249
3 for Rs.100?
Show me.

1717
01:59:39,917 --> 01:59:42,916
See! Same design!

1718
01:59:44,167 --> 01:59:46,958
Check it.

1719
01:59:47,167 --> 01:59:48,291
You really got cheated.

1720
01:59:48,959 --> 01:59:51,708
Please buy it.- This one?
lt'll be good, buy it.

1721
01:59:52,125 --> 01:59:55,124
Take it...take it...

1722
01:59:55,125 --> 01:59:57,499
Take care of what he wants,
l'll come back in a moment.

1723
02:00:04,167 --> 02:00:06,166
How much is this one?
- Rs.50.

1724
02:00:06,750 --> 02:00:09,166
Take it for Rs.45.

1725
02:00:11,167 --> 02:00:14,124
How much you'll get for selling this?
- Rs.10.

1726
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:22,541
Rs.100? No thanks.

1727
02:00:22,792 --> 02:00:24,166
Keep it.- No thanks please.
- Please take it.

1728
02:00:24,167 --> 02:00:25,749
God bless you son.

1729
02:00:37,375 --> 02:00:38,124
Why are you smiling, PJ?

1730
02:00:38,375 --> 02:00:42,124
My friends there wouldn't be happy
even if I spent Rs.5000 on parties.

1731
02:00:42,375 --> 02:00:44,333
l didn't even spend Rs.500 here.

1732
02:00:44,792 --> 02:00:47,124
The old lady is still working
to earn a decent living.

1733
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:50,541
How are they able to live
so content fully?

1734
02:00:50,834 --> 02:00:52,999
Neither it is in Rs.500 nor in Rs.5000,

1735
02:00:53,250 --> 02:00:54,999
happiness and contentedness is here.

1736
02:00:55,834 --> 02:00:58,791
How?- The day no fish caught, what ever
food left in home is served to me,

1737
02:00:59,042 --> 02:01:00,791
mother used to sleep on empty stomach,

1738
02:01:01,042 --> 02:01:03,583
mother was more happy then,
you know why?

1739
02:01:04,042 --> 02:01:05,958
Thinking at least I had my stomach full.

1740
02:01:06,209 --> 02:01:07,374
Didn't get it, right?

1741
02:01:07,625 --> 02:01:10,999
God created us to love and use things.

1742
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:14,249
But in our confusion we use
humans and love things.

1743
02:01:15,834 --> 02:01:17,583
The day this changes,
it's happiness everywhere.

1744
02:01:17,834 --> 02:01:18,958
Everyone will be happy.

1745
02:01:23,250 --> 02:01:24,041
Stop!

1746
02:01:24,042 --> 02:01:26,416
Somebody is calling,
he wants to talk to you only.

1747
02:01:34,459 --> 02:01:40,999
Hey nationalization! It's getting dark,
call if you've to call anyone.

1748
02:01:44,459 --> 02:01:47,833
l was a toddler when
l lost my mother,

1749
02:01:48,875 --> 02:01:50,208
now he's dead,

1750
02:01:51,084 --> 02:01:52,833
l don't know anyone else.

1751
02:01:54,084 --> 02:01:57,208
My father is dead!

1752
02:02:04,084 --> 02:02:06,083
How long will you sit like this?

1753
02:02:06,084 --> 02:02:08,666
lf you cry,
can the dead man come back?

1754
02:02:08,917 --> 02:02:11,749
Call someone, let's cremate him.
- How can you do it?

1755
02:02:13,500 --> 02:02:15,083
You need at least four people to carry.

1756
02:02:15,084 --> 02:02:16,666
Father!

1757
02:02:17,084 --> 02:02:19,458
l told you to be with our caste
people, you didn't care.

1758
02:02:20,125 --> 02:02:22,291
Will you say no to me for that outsider?

1759
02:02:22,292 --> 02:02:23,666
l'll see now who will help you!

1760
02:02:23,917 --> 02:02:25,666
Cry sitting with the corpse here.

1761
02:02:25,917 --> 02:02:27,083
Stop it, you...

1762
02:02:29,959 --> 02:02:33,083
You get up.
Please take him away.

1763
02:02:36,125 --> 02:02:37,708
Please don't let him become an orphan.

1764
02:02:37,959 --> 02:02:39,708
Why are you playing politics now?

1765
02:02:42,125 --> 02:02:45,124
PJ, no acting please,
this is our caste issue.

1766
02:02:45,125 --> 02:02:45,958
Mind your business.

1767
02:02:46,959 --> 02:02:50,124
What's this?
He plays drama with every issue.

1768
02:02:51,167 --> 02:02:52,124
Come on boys.

1769
02:03:25,167 --> 02:03:28,124
Super! With this you'll get all the
votes of his caste.

1770
02:03:32,167 --> 02:03:33,958
You're no different from Ammiraju.

1771
02:03:35,042 --> 02:03:36,124
Do you see votes there?

1772
02:03:36,375 --> 02:03:38,749
l see the smile of Nationalization
burning over there.

1773
02:03:40,625 --> 02:03:42,999
l'm thinking about money only.

1774
02:03:43,625 --> 02:03:46,583
How will he live losing the only
bread winner of the family?

1775
02:03:48,250 --> 02:03:50,374
You wanted me to change
but you've changed.

1776
02:03:55,417 --> 02:03:57,791
Why did you say like
that now, Kannababu?

1777
02:03:58,209 --> 02:04:00,374
l was just testing if he has
really changed or not.

1778
02:04:01,209 --> 02:04:02,958
l don't know if he can become
the president or not,

1779
02:04:03,209 --> 02:04:04,791
but l'm sure he'll become a leader.

1780
02:04:05,042 --> 02:04:10,166
When you can nationalize our things,
can't we nationalize your grief and burden?

1781
02:04:11,625 --> 02:04:12,999
We're all there for you.

1782
02:04:20,667 --> 02:04:22,999
Second year results are out, Jayaramaraju.

1783
02:04:23,250 --> 02:04:25,833
Uncle, that is...
- You've passed.

1784
02:04:26,084 --> 02:04:27,999
You're submitting the project
work tomorrow, right?

1785
02:04:28,250 --> 02:04:29,624
l'll submit, uncle.

1786
02:04:30,084 --> 02:04:32,041
Sindhu was here to meet you.

1787
02:04:41,500 --> 02:04:43,041
Will you come out on date with me?

1788
02:04:44,667 --> 02:04:45,791
But not like this.

1789
02:04:46,084 --> 02:04:48,458
lt's been many days since
l've seen you as PJ.

1790
02:05:06,125 --> 02:05:10,041
Go around me...

1791
02:05:10,292 --> 02:05:13,874
l swear my love for you is
growing like an honeycomb...

1792
02:05:14,125 --> 02:05:18,458
Be patient...

1793
02:05:18,709 --> 02:05:23,499
lf love hits back,
the secret will be out...

1794
02:05:23,750 --> 02:05:30,124
l've embossed you in my heart,
O Kondapalli doll...

1795
02:05:30,125 --> 02:05:36,083
l'm a sweet bird,
you're my sweetness...

1796
02:05:36,334 --> 02:05:39,499
Stop looking at me,
come to me, my dear...

1797
02:05:39,750 --> 02:05:42,708
Oh no! l'm still a little girl...

1798
02:05:42,959 --> 02:05:45,708
The bed is rocking...

1799
02:05:45,959 --> 02:05:49,083
Shall we break it and
make it useless?

1800
02:05:49,334 --> 02:05:55,749
My long plait is angry...
will you tie the knot with me?

1801
02:06:15,209 --> 02:06:18,166
l know the fish in the hook...
l know the bone in fish...

1802
02:06:18,167 --> 02:06:21,124
But l don't know the heart of
this fish eyed beauty...

1803
02:06:21,417 --> 02:06:24,166
Shyness is our relative...
you're a traditional suitor...

1804
02:06:24,417 --> 02:06:27,583
lsn't it a woman's birth right
to be secretive?

1805
02:06:27,834 --> 02:06:33,999
You've blindfolded your heart...
remove and see, you'll find me...

1806
02:06:34,250 --> 02:06:40,166
l foresee the future...
l won't stop myself after seeing you...

1807
02:06:40,417 --> 02:06:43,374
Shed shyness...say yes to me....

1808
02:06:43,625 --> 02:06:46,999
Without getting confused or
any hesitation, O my dear...

1809
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:52,958
Don't search out, find within
yourself I'm there in you...

1810
02:07:18,875 --> 02:07:24,624
l've brought the bullock cart...
l've brought the small car...

1811
02:07:24,875 --> 02:07:27,833
Let's go to the festival...

1812
02:07:28,084 --> 02:07:31,041
l don't want bullock cart
or small car...

1813
02:07:31,292 --> 02:07:34,041
l love if you give me
a piggyback ride...

1814
02:07:34,292 --> 02:07:37,249
Shall I get you jasmine or lily?

1815
02:07:37,500 --> 02:07:44,458
No need of any flowers, my beau...
your smiles are enough, come my dear...

1816
02:08:07,125 --> 02:08:08,499
ls everyone here for the debate?

1817
02:08:08,750 --> 02:08:12,083
Rajanna, its 1 1 am, where is he?

1818
02:08:12,334 --> 02:08:14,083
Yes, where's PJ?

1819
02:08:15,167 --> 02:08:20,291
You can't start the debate
without the opponent, Ammiraju.

1820
02:08:20,750 --> 02:08:24,374
He's a drunkard; he would be
sleeping after a drinking binge.

1821
02:08:25,959 --> 02:08:28,708
Did you see PJ anywhere?
- No. Not seen anywhere.

1822
02:08:30,959 --> 02:08:32,916
Did you see him?
- He's not in hostel too.

1823
02:08:33,167 --> 02:08:34,708
What's this drama, sir?

1824
02:08:35,542 --> 02:08:37,124
Dear students!

1825
02:08:37,375 --> 02:08:40,124
Please vote for me and
make me your president.

1826
02:08:40,584 --> 02:08:43,333
What else you want,
l'll do anything.

1827
02:08:43,584 --> 02:08:45,749
ln my rule, l'll cut the college trees,

1828
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:47,333
l'll put up electric poles,

1829
02:08:47,584 --> 02:08:49,333
and make this college
shine bright with lights,

1830
02:08:49,584 --> 02:08:52,416
Hail motherland! Hail Ammiraju!

1831
02:08:53,167 --> 02:08:55,333
Greetings my dear brothers
and sisters,

1832
02:08:55,584 --> 02:08:59,749
l'll build a bus stop on our
college's name,

1833
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:01,333
l'll put up name boards,

1834
02:09:01,584 --> 02:09:04,333
l'm asking is there anyone
who can do well?

1835
02:09:04,584 --> 02:09:06,333
l must pinch his thigh, idiot!

1836
02:09:08,584 --> 02:09:11,166
Are we useless fools?
Just 5 minutes only.

1837
02:09:12,417 --> 02:09:14,374
l'll erect a fountain in the
middle of our village.

1838
02:09:14,625 --> 02:09:15,374
l mean a tap that spills water.

1839
02:09:15,625 --> 02:09:16,791
l'll build a park around it.

1840
02:09:17,042 --> 02:09:21,791
ln that park, I'll erect a statue of
our caste leader Bomma Pitchaiah,

1841
02:09:22,042 --> 02:09:23,374
Brothers and sisters...

1842
02:09:23,625 --> 02:09:27,874
l told him watch news channel,
l think he saw all the channels.

1843
02:09:31,625 --> 02:09:32,791
Here comes PJ!

1844
02:09:33,209 --> 02:09:35,166
Here he is!
- Please come quickly on the dais.

1845
02:09:35,417 --> 02:09:36,958
See, the stink is reaching up to here.

1846
02:09:38,625 --> 02:09:40,791
lt's all over, sir.
How can you allow him now?

1847
02:09:45,667 --> 02:09:47,208
Yes, I'm a drunkard.

1848
02:09:47,459 --> 02:09:49,041
l'm a loafer too.

1849
02:09:50,084 --> 02:09:52,999
But l've a qualification which
Ammiraju doesn't have it.

1850
02:09:55,084 --> 02:09:56,041
That is...

1851
02:09:58,667 --> 02:10:01,833
Thinking!

1852
02:10:02,084 --> 02:10:04,833
l don't why do we needs lights in
college which closes by 4 pm.

1853
02:10:05,084 --> 02:10:06,624
That too after cutting down the trees.

1854
02:10:07,667 --> 02:10:10,999
There are mounds of broken
benches behind the auditorium.

1855
02:10:11,667 --> 02:10:14,041
lt seems he'll put up benches
somewhere in village.

1856
02:10:14,042 --> 02:10:15,249
Students standing out there,

1857
02:10:15,459 --> 02:10:17,833
if you want to hear this debate
sitting on bench at least next year,

1858
02:10:18,084 --> 02:10:20,999
get the benches repaired,
- Good.- What do you say?

1859
02:10:22,709 --> 02:10:23,958
Then our science lab,

1860
02:10:25,084 --> 02:10:26,041
without the equipment,

1861
02:10:26,292 --> 02:10:28,249
students are using steel glasses
instead of glass equipment,

1862
02:10:29,084 --> 02:10:34,083
recently big chunks of roof fell off,
l was the one who got hurt,

1863
02:10:34,709 --> 02:10:36,666
thank God Sindhu was there
to write my exam,

1864
02:10:38,500 --> 02:10:39,874
What did he say just now?

1865
02:10:40,125 --> 02:10:43,083
Fountain in village and a statue.
Good!

1866
02:10:43,709 --> 02:10:47,458
Septic tank is broken and
the smell is reaching kitchen.

1867
02:10:47,750 --> 02:10:48,458
No, stench.

1868
02:10:49,125 --> 02:10:52,708
No proper books in the library,
no proper water taps in toilets,

1869
02:10:52,959 --> 02:10:53,708
Are there so many problems
without coming to our knowledge?

1870
02:10:53,959 --> 02:10:54,499
Please note it down.

1871
02:10:54,750 --> 02:10:56,083
There are not much finds to repair it.

1872
02:10:56,334 --> 02:10:58,291
This is our college,
we must repair it ourselves.

1873
02:10:58,750 --> 02:11:00,291
Yes, I'm a drunkard.

1874
02:11:00,750 --> 02:11:02,499
l had farex too as an infant.

1875
02:11:02,750 --> 02:11:05,708
Both are past.
See what I'm now!

1876
02:11:07,125 --> 02:11:09,499
To solve your problems and
to be your leader,

1877
02:11:09,750 --> 02:11:12,291
l'm creating myself newly every day,

1878
02:11:13,542 --> 02:11:14,291
and keep on doing.

1879
02:11:18,125 --> 02:11:19,124
Your decision!

1880
02:11:20,750 --> 02:11:23,416
Not this!
l'll speak!

1881
02:11:23,959 --> 02:11:26,333
l've been watching PJ from day one,

1882
02:11:26,584 --> 02:11:28,083
PJ has changed a lot,

1883
02:11:28,375 --> 02:11:31,541
a leader is one who changes
himself first to bring change,

1884
02:11:31,792 --> 02:11:32,541
PJ is our leader!

1885
02:11:32,792 --> 02:11:35,541
Are you done? Half of the
students belong to my caste.

1886
02:11:35,792 --> 02:11:36,541
Why don't you say something boys?

1887
02:11:36,792 --> 02:11:38,166
Do you see votes there?

1888
02:11:38,167 --> 02:11:40,541
l see the smile of Nationalization
burning over there.

1889
02:11:40,792 --> 02:11:42,333
l'm thinking of money only now.

1890
02:11:42,584 --> 02:11:46,749
President from our caste is helpful,
what's the use if an outsider becomes?

1891
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:47,541
Tell boys!

1892
02:11:47,792 --> 02:11:49,958
What caste?

1893
02:11:50,209 --> 02:11:53,208
He saw a friend in sorrow
not his caste.

1894
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:56,124
lt was we who played politics
even on dead bodies.

1895
02:11:57,000 --> 02:11:59,999
Students who think they're born to
parents out of love come with me,

1896
02:12:00,209 --> 02:12:03,374
if you think it's for caste,
then be with him.

1897
02:12:06,209 --> 02:12:08,208
What are you waiting for? Get up!

1898
02:12:08,209 --> 02:12:12,166
Stop...I beg you...stop...

1899
02:12:12,417 --> 02:12:14,999
Who is your leader?

1900
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:21,374
PJ is our leader!

1901
02:12:34,459 --> 02:12:36,041
No way! I'll talk again.

1902
02:12:36,875 --> 02:12:40,624
lt has been decided to elect PJ
as the new president.

1903
02:12:40,875 --> 02:12:43,208
This is cheating,
l'll walk out in protest.

1904
02:12:47,042 --> 02:12:48,624
Six months later...
- Go that side.

1905
02:12:50,459 --> 02:12:51,208
What's our plan, boss?

1906
02:12:51,459 --> 02:12:54,208
Boss? This is pre-climax.
Sircar plan.

1907
02:12:55,459 --> 02:12:57,416
lf you cut it.- You didn't begin and
already a cut, Sircar.

1908
02:12:57,875 --> 02:12:59,208
Shut up, I've paid him Rs.50000.

1909
02:13:01,292 --> 02:13:02,208
Okay.

1910
02:13:02,500 --> 02:13:04,666
lf you cut it, a mud road...

1911
02:13:04,917 --> 02:13:08,041
On that mud road your heroine
and your villain...

1912
02:13:08,250 --> 02:13:09,874
on a Hero Honda bike...

1913
02:13:10,125 --> 02:13:12,083
Not Hero Honda bike sir,
Hero One bicycle.

1914
02:13:13,292 --> 02:13:15,749
Boys, use a thin wire.
- Why a wire, Sircar?

1915
02:13:16,084 --> 02:13:19,083
Don't you watch films?
Sumos fly in air in the films.

1916
02:13:19,084 --> 02:13:20,249
You'll see live now.

1917
02:13:20,500 --> 02:13:25,874
The cycle that is coming fast will
hit the stiffwire across the road,

1918
02:13:26,125 --> 02:13:27,874
it'll fly high into the air!

1919
02:13:28,917 --> 02:13:31,041
Unlike last time,
you must write the exam.

1920
02:13:31,292 --> 02:13:32,666
ls it?
- Got it?- Very well.

1921
02:13:32,917 --> 02:13:35,666
Your villain's lifecycle will
get punctured.

1922
02:13:37,542 --> 02:13:38,249
Already it's over.

1923
02:13:39,292 --> 02:13:42,291
Bloody Sircar plan!
- Cool, I've shelled out Rs.50000.

1924
02:13:42,542 --> 02:13:43,916
You gave and lost it too.

1925
02:13:44,125 --> 02:13:45,708
l think puncture again.

1926
02:13:45,959 --> 02:13:49,374
My plan flopping? No way.
Kill him boys! Come on boys!

1927
02:13:50,334 --> 02:13:51,083
Brother!

1928
02:13:51,750 --> 02:13:53,708
Brother?
- We're finished.
- Come let's go.

1929
02:13:54,959 --> 02:13:56,083
Brother, move...he our man.

1930
02:13:56,334 --> 02:13:57,499
We put a wire, please pay us.

1931
02:13:57,750 --> 02:14:00,124
l don't want people who
work for money only. Go away.

1932
02:14:01,125 --> 02:14:04,291
What are you doing here?
Still not yet reformed?

1933
02:14:05,125 --> 02:14:07,166
Where's the Chunni?
- She left with Jenny.

1934
02:14:07,167 --> 02:14:09,083
l'm ashamed to talk about it.

1935
02:14:09,334 --> 02:14:11,124
l beat you because
she went with you.- What?

1936
02:14:11,125 --> 02:14:12,958
That is got beaten up by you.

1937
02:14:13,125 --> 02:14:15,541
Forget all that l gave up studies.

1938
02:14:15,792 --> 02:14:16,958
l'm living by running kangaroo courts.

1939
02:14:17,209 --> 02:14:21,166
That's what we learnt in
college, right? l mean I...

1940
02:14:23,584 --> 02:14:25,749
What's this trouble?
l've to go to write exam.

1941
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:30,166
You go brother, the man who
gave me money to kill you...he's gone!

1942
02:14:30,167 --> 02:14:31,541
l'll take him to task.

1943
02:14:34,584 --> 02:14:38,333
l'll take to task Ammiraju
and his family.

1944
02:14:40,209 --> 02:14:41,749
Why are you standing there
like 100 days poster?

1945
02:14:42,042 --> 02:14:43,791
Ask if PJ needs any slips.

1946
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:45,791
Brother...
- Don't ask money in location.

1947
02:14:47,375 --> 02:14:49,791
Would like to see mine?
- Write.

1948
02:14:56,250 --> 02:14:58,791
We paid him money and
ended up as losers.

1949
02:14:59,042 --> 02:15:02,791
We paid him, let him do something.

1950
02:15:03,042 --> 02:15:04,958
Who is there?
- Nobody.

1951
02:15:05,209 --> 02:15:06,583
lt seems nobody is there.

1952
02:15:27,042 --> 02:15:28,833
I think you?ve written your
exams well, PJ.

1953
02:15:29,084 --> 02:15:29,624
l have written well, madam.

1954
02:15:29,875 --> 02:15:31,208
What about Kannababu?

1955
02:15:34,250 --> 02:15:36,041
Has everyone come?

1956
02:15:37,667 --> 02:15:39,416
Looks like a foreign car.

1957
02:15:44,084 --> 02:15:45,833
Our Kannababu!

1958
02:15:50,709 --> 02:15:51,874
lt's me, master.

1959
02:15:52,125 --> 02:15:54,249
My father used to go fishing
on iron boats,

1960
02:15:54,459 --> 02:15:55,458
it used to get rust,

1961
02:15:55,709 --> 02:15:58,249
l used to think how my education
would help my father,

1962
02:15:58,500 --> 02:16:02,874
my experiment on bio-coat paint to
stop rust won Planet Green award.

1963
02:16:03,125 --> 02:16:05,083
That's all l got big job
and good salary.

1964
02:16:05,084 --> 02:16:08,041
lt's all your mercy, master.
- I'm very happy, boy.

1965
02:16:08,292 --> 02:16:10,458
PJ is receiving the degree,
let's watch it.

1966
02:16:12,292 --> 02:16:15,041
...is receiving degree from VC.

1967
02:16:30,750 --> 02:16:32,916
Every year when students
left the college,

1968
02:16:33,167 --> 02:16:36,083
we used to feel proud that they
changed because of our toughness.

1969
02:16:36,334 --> 02:16:40,916
But this year l feel sad like
my own children leaving me.

1970
02:16:44,750 --> 02:16:47,916
How could he get degree?
l'll not accept. He's a cheat.

1971
02:16:50,167 --> 02:16:52,083
You're a fraud.

1972
02:16:52,750 --> 02:16:56,958
He didn't become president for us,
but for the wealth.

1973
02:16:58,125 --> 02:16:59,083
lt's a along story.

1974
02:16:59,334 --> 02:17:03,541
He cooked up tales about repairing
the college roof, benches, lab.

1975
02:17:03,792 --> 02:17:05,958
You believed him and voted him
to be your president.

1976
02:17:06,209 --> 02:17:07,958
What did he do?
He cheated you.

1977
02:17:08,209 --> 02:17:09,749
He'll take the degree and go away.

1978
02:17:10,584 --> 02:17:13,958
Take his resignation,
only then he'll come to senses.

1979
02:17:14,209 --> 02:17:14,958
He'll not get the wealth.

1980
02:17:15,209 --> 02:17:17,541
Wealth? Where is it?

1981
02:17:19,209 --> 02:17:21,124
With just one year of friendship,

1982
02:17:21,375 --> 02:17:23,124
for my sake, without batting
an eye, billions of his wealth,

1983
02:17:23,375 --> 02:17:25,124
he gave it up, PJ is
so foolish, Ammiraju.

1984
02:17:26,209 --> 02:17:26,958
He's not a cheat.

1985
02:17:27,209 --> 02:17:29,541
You say he has become
president to get his wealth.

1986
02:17:29,834 --> 02:17:32,999
But you don't know what had happened
a day before he became president.

1987
02:17:38,417 --> 02:17:41,374
Who are the patient's relatives?
- Tell me.

1988
02:17:44,209 --> 02:17:46,374
We're sending his liver
tissue to Bombay,

1989
02:17:46,625 --> 02:17:49,374
according to my opinion,
it's completely damaged,

1990
02:17:49,625 --> 02:17:51,999
l think they've neglected
it for long time.

1991
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:53,583
lf that's the problem,

1992
02:17:53,834 --> 02:17:59,166
get ready a blood relative to
donate liver and Rs.25 lakhs.

1993
02:18:06,084 --> 02:18:08,208
l'm telling l don't have money,
leave me alone.

1994
02:18:14,084 --> 02:18:15,041
No...

1995
02:18:21,875 --> 02:18:23,208
l know you're calling me for money.

1996
02:18:23,459 --> 02:18:25,124
As a businessman, l'll never
invest in losing ventures.

1997
02:18:26,459 --> 02:18:28,041
l told you not to meet him.

1998
02:18:28,042 --> 02:18:30,041
Why did you go?
Come back immediately.

1999
02:18:31,459 --> 02:18:34,833
Would've said no money, any advises?

2000
02:18:35,917 --> 02:18:37,208
Threats!

2001
02:18:39,667 --> 02:18:41,874
Rs.25 lakhs?

2002
02:18:42,125 --> 02:18:46,249
From your wealth,
l mean your grandpa's wealth,

2003
02:18:46,500 --> 02:18:50,083
l'm not allowed to give you
even a penny.

2004
02:18:51,125 --> 02:18:52,874
Till you complete your degree...

2005
02:18:56,500 --> 02:19:00,083
Lend me as loan.
- Loan? What do you have?

2006
02:19:00,084 --> 02:19:02,458
Except the arrogance of
your grandpa's wealth.

2007
02:19:03,125 --> 02:19:05,083
l've given tips more than this.

2008
02:19:06,084 --> 02:19:10,666
But now I know money has the
power to save a human life.

2009
02:19:11,167 --> 02:19:14,499
l'm useless, I'll get ruined
if l get the wealth.

2010
02:19:14,709 --> 02:19:16,916
He's brilliant, a great scholar.

2011
02:19:17,334 --> 02:19:20,499
lf he lives, he has power to
change lives of many.

2012
02:19:20,750 --> 02:19:25,124
Let him die.
Who cares if a poor man dies or lives?

2013
02:19:55,375 --> 02:19:57,166
Why are you getting tensed?

2014
02:19:57,167 --> 02:20:02,333
lf I die, my birth date and death
are put under my photo,

2015
02:20:03,167 --> 02:20:06,333
but if you get the degree,
you can help thousands like me.

2016
02:20:08,209 --> 02:20:09,166
Go.

2017
02:20:18,042 --> 02:20:22,166
l've given a good thought on your
words, I felt your sincerity,

2018
02:20:22,417 --> 02:20:23,999
you wanted to help your friend,

2019
02:20:24,250 --> 02:20:27,208
l thoroughly checked your
grandpa's will,

2020
02:20:27,209 --> 02:20:28,999
before fulfilling the conditions,

2021
02:20:29,250 --> 02:20:33,166
if you accept you're incompetent
and sign the papers
giving up the property,

2022
02:20:33,417 --> 02:20:37,958
your grandpa allotted Rs.30 lakhs for you.
Will you accept it?

2023
02:20:38,625 --> 02:20:41,166
Tell me, do you want
Rs.30 lakhs for your friend?

2024
02:20:41,417 --> 02:20:42,958
Or you want the wealth for yourself?

2025
02:20:49,209 --> 02:20:50,208
True sir.

2026
02:20:52,625 --> 02:20:56,416
lfe he says he gave up wealth for
his operation, you may stop him,

2027
02:20:56,875 --> 02:20:59,041
so he lied that l had
arranged the money.

2028
02:21:02,667 --> 02:21:03,624
No problem.

2029
02:21:29,500 --> 02:21:31,458
This is what I'm left with.

2030
02:21:32,500 --> 02:21:34,458
lf it can be useful to college...

2031
02:21:40,084 --> 02:21:41,541
Sit down, we've lost our honour.

2032
02:21:45,292 --> 02:21:47,541
How will you live without money, PJ?

2033
02:21:50,125 --> 02:21:52,458
She's asking how would I live?

2034
02:21:53,292 --> 02:21:55,124
l came here with fear.

2035
02:21:55,917 --> 02:21:57,083
Not for degree.

2036
02:21:57,292 --> 02:22:00,124
With a doubt if I would get
the wealth or not.

2037
02:22:01,334 --> 02:22:02,999
l thought it's all over.

2038
02:22:03,750 --> 02:22:06,124
But after coming here, l won over life.

2039
02:22:08,125 --> 02:22:11,291
You're worrying how l would
live without money.

2040
02:22:11,959 --> 02:22:16,083
But in these two years you all
gave me that confidence.

2041
02:22:18,125 --> 02:22:20,291
lt's notjust teachers
who taught me here,

2042
02:22:20,542 --> 02:22:23,708
there are two others,
life and time!

2043
02:22:24,167 --> 02:22:27,166
The life I spent here will
lead me all the time,

2044
02:22:27,167 --> 02:22:30,499
but the two years spent here
made me see what is life.

2045
02:22:34,375 --> 02:22:38,124
l thought it's an achievement to
spend 2 years with such people.

2046
02:22:38,375 --> 02:22:41,749
But when I realised they endured
a man like me for 2 years,

2047
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:43,749
l've understood the greatness of
their friendship and greatness.

2048
02:22:50,167 --> 02:22:53,958
l've realised happiness is not
in pubs, cars or in luxuries.

2049
02:22:55,167 --> 02:23:00,124
How to spend a rupee and
how to see humans as humans,

2050
02:23:00,375 --> 02:23:01,791
how to mingle with them,

2051
02:23:02,167 --> 02:23:03,541
how to smile,

2052
02:23:03,792 --> 02:23:06,166
last but the least I learnt
how to cry also here only.

2053
02:23:07,209 --> 02:23:12,208
My grandpa's wealth gave me
fear of losing only.

2054
02:23:12,209 --> 02:23:15,166
But the wealth you gave me is
confidence to face life,

2055
02:23:15,417 --> 02:23:17,791
and live against all odds.

2056
02:23:21,834 --> 02:23:25,999
lf I ever take a wrong step in life,
l'll come back here sir.

2057
02:23:27,209 --> 02:23:28,999
Would I get a room here, sir?

2058
02:23:29,834 --> 02:23:32,583
Here, always it's here for you.

2059
02:23:52,042 --> 02:23:53,999
What brings you this far, Sharat?

2060
02:23:54,250 --> 02:23:56,624
Looks like your girth has increased.
l think you're missing me.

2061
02:23:56,875 --> 02:24:00,041
Respect?
You used to call me informally.

2062
02:24:00,459 --> 02:24:03,208
There's a last condition.

2063
02:24:03,459 --> 02:24:04,999
Condition? Again?

2064
02:24:05,250 --> 02:24:08,041
l don't have anything left
other than my grandpa.
- There is!

2065
02:24:08,500 --> 02:24:10,624
Your grandpa's will's idea
is to change you.

2066
02:24:10,875 --> 02:24:12,083
l know as a human.

2067
02:24:12,084 --> 02:24:15,666
For human welfare...
- Look, I got 42 marks only in Telugu.

2068
02:24:15,917 --> 02:24:18,083
l got it, that you're not getting it.

2069
02:24:18,084 --> 02:24:22,874
lf you're ready to give up the
wealth for a good cause,

2070
02:24:23,125 --> 02:24:25,666
your grandpa's will suggests
you can gift the entire wealth.

2071
02:24:25,917 --> 02:24:29,249
You've got the invaluable,
accept the wealth as gift.

2072
02:24:30,125 --> 02:24:32,083
You don't get one thing.
- What's it?

2073
02:24:32,084 --> 02:24:33,666
l don't like gifts.

2074
02:24:33,917 --> 02:24:35,666
Then, accept it as responsibility.

2075
02:24:35,917 --> 02:24:38,666
Why did you come personally?
A phone call and l would've come.

2076
02:24:41,959 --> 02:24:43,083
Lord!

2077
02:24:43,292 --> 02:24:45,499
You're working for me, right?- Sir.

2078
02:24:46,125 --> 02:24:47,291
Give me a hug.

2079
02:24:57,750 --> 02:24:59,291
ls the fancy dress ready?

2080
02:24:59,542 --> 02:25:02,708
PJ, Ammiraju has kidnapped Sindhu.

2081
02:25:02,959 --> 02:25:05,291
Who?
- Sindhu.

2082
02:25:06,125 --> 02:25:07,291
Did you see Chunky?

2083
02:25:07,542 --> 02:25:10,916
He was roaming in long skirt
like girl for fashion show.

2084
02:25:13,542 --> 02:25:14,916
Why did you kidnap me?

2085
02:25:15,209 --> 02:25:16,124
Try to answer yourself.

2086
02:25:22,584 --> 02:25:25,166
What did I say now?
- You said rape, boss.

2087
02:25:25,167 --> 02:25:28,333
Rape means that thing, right?
- Indeed.

2088
02:25:32,209 --> 02:25:36,749
Rape mean not what you do,
but what is done to you.

2089
02:25:37,000 --> 02:25:39,124
That's it, promise, swear...

2090
02:25:41,000 --> 02:25:44,541
l'll not say differently under
promise and without it.

2091
02:25:45,584 --> 02:25:48,458
People always say this
and then do nothing.

2092
02:25:55,209 --> 02:25:56,791
ls Ammiraju okay to you?

2093
02:26:04,042 --> 02:26:04,958
Anyone is okay to me.

2094
02:26:14,834 --> 02:26:16,958
Who is it? Is PJ next to you?

2095
02:26:17,209 --> 02:26:20,791
Tell him, l'm going to rape Sindhu.

2096
02:26:21,250 --> 02:26:23,374
PJ, it seems he'll rape Sindhu.

2097
02:26:23,625 --> 02:26:26,416
Not him, I'm going rape her.
Super again.

2098
02:26:26,667 --> 02:26:28,833
lt seems he'll do it.
- Give me.

2099
02:26:31,084 --> 02:26:34,416
PJ, in every story hero
wins in the end,

2100
02:26:34,667 --> 02:26:36,416
l'm winning in this story also,

2101
02:26:36,667 --> 02:26:37,833
That's what l'm telling you.

2102
02:26:38,084 --> 02:26:41,416
There are no ifs and buts, only action!

2103
02:26:42,667 --> 02:26:45,416
What is he saying?
- He means business.

2104
02:26:45,667 --> 02:26:47,041
Thanks.

2105
02:26:49,250 --> 02:26:49,833
But is rape necessary?

2106
02:26:50,084 --> 02:26:51,916
Today or tomorrow,
rape is the only answer.

2107
02:26:53,042 --> 02:26:55,041
Ammiraju, have a blast!

2108
02:27:01,917 --> 02:27:04,041
lt started like that...
- What?

2109
02:27:12,709 --> 02:27:14,041
Safe?
- The girl is safe.

2110
02:27:14,292 --> 02:27:15,874
l asked if brother is safe.

2111
02:27:16,125 --> 02:27:17,666
Brother? He's a tiger.

2112
02:27:18,917 --> 02:27:20,874
He doesn't know the real matter.

2113
02:27:21,292 --> 02:27:22,874
Ammiraju has come.

2114
02:27:25,500 --> 02:27:27,708
Wait there, I'll kill you.

2115
02:27:28,334 --> 02:27:30,458
Anyway rape is over,
why this chase now?

2116
02:27:30,709 --> 02:27:33,083
l asked for Sindhu,
will you bring this damn thing?

2117
02:27:33,750 --> 02:27:35,499
lsn't she the lady you wanted?
- She's not a lady at all!

2118
02:27:38,334 --> 02:27:40,708
Catch him...catch him...

2119
02:27:43,959 --> 02:27:46,124
Shall we go to watch a film?
- We saw one just now.

2120
02:27:46,125 --> 02:27:47,291
lt's good, right?
- So what?

2121
02:27:47,542 --> 02:27:49,708
Let's watch again.
- Again?

2122
02:27:49,959 --> 02:27:51,291
Good films don't come again and again.

2123
02:27:51,542 --> 02:27:52,499
Then, let's watch.

2124
02:27:55,334 --> 02:28:00,291
One minute, thanks for giving your precious
