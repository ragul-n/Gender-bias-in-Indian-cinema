1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:01,000
29.970

2
00:00:47,631 --> 00:00:53,332
Naved Rabbani, answer to the point
if you want to save your skin

3
00:00:53,832 --> 00:00:59,198
Jehad (Holy war). Jehad is the answer
to every question of yours

4
00:00:59,765 --> 00:01:03,865
7th October, Doda military camp;
22 Indian soldiers were killed

5
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:09,197
Were you behind the attack in which
we killed four of your accomplices?

6
00:01:09,563 --> 00:01:11,399
Speak up!

7
00:01:12,563 --> 00:01:17,465
Wrong. We got rid of 22 enemies

8
00:01:18,531 --> 00:01:21,197
And four of our Jehadis
attained martyrdom in the operation

9
00:01:21,563 --> 00:01:24,462
It means you admit that
you were the one who conspired

10
00:01:24,831 --> 00:01:28,765
Wafai Al Haq is not
a single identity, officer

11
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:32,765
It is the name of
thousands of men like Naved Rabbani

12
00:01:33,798 --> 00:01:36,230
Where is your headquarter?
On whose directions...

13
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:38,965
are you spreading terror
in our country?

14
00:01:39,596 --> 00:01:44,430
We want to know what your outfit is
plotting right now to bring us to harm?

15
00:01:44,831 --> 00:01:48,596
Speak!
- Not words...

16
00:01:48,962 --> 00:01:53,798
we are taught the language of guns
to talk to you guys

17
00:01:55,831 --> 00:01:58,096
And remember this one thing, officer

18
00:01:58,897 --> 00:02:03,930
You cannot keep Naved Rabbani
under custody for long

19
00:02:05,563 --> 00:02:09,597
Because our Jehadi soldiers know
what nerve to hit...

20
00:02:09,962 --> 00:02:14,330
to bring your government
down on its knees

21
00:05:37,026 --> 00:05:39,692
Anita! Move away!

22
00:06:21,192 --> 00:06:24,492
What's your problem?
Why don't you understand...

23
00:06:24,858 --> 00:06:28,625
that a militant outfit is
hovering over your head like death?

24
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:32,658
Despite mine and Amarjeet Singh's
orders why did you come here?

25
00:06:33,091 --> 00:06:35,189
Why don't you realise?

26
00:06:35,591 --> 00:06:39,391
It is for your own safety
that we brought you here from India

27
00:06:39,891 --> 00:06:42,625
And I'm responsible for your safety

28
00:06:43,024 --> 00:06:45,858
What would I answer them
had something happened to you?

29
00:06:47,725 --> 00:06:48,658
Come on

30
00:06:49,925 --> 00:06:51,059
Junaid-bhai!

31
00:07:19,958 --> 00:07:23,858
Junaid-bhai, our attempt to murder the
Home Minister's daughter has failed

32
00:08:24,588 --> 00:08:27,423
Uncle, you cancelled
your trip back to India?

33
00:08:28,254 --> 00:08:29,189
Yes

34
00:08:30,956 --> 00:08:33,855
It was my mistake.
Your forbid me, yet...

35
00:08:34,221 --> 00:08:37,589
It's tough to understand you.
You are very crooked

36
00:08:38,221 --> 00:08:42,187
You commit mistakes again and again and
then you pull a long face before me

37
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:47,589
And I'm such an idiot, I take
every mistake of yours to be the last

38
00:08:53,153 --> 00:08:55,855
Mr Kaul?
- Nothing to worry, Mr Chaudhary

39
00:08:56,221 --> 00:08:57,721
Everything is fine

40
00:08:59,022 --> 00:09:03,922
But you must reason with Anita.
It all happened due to her foolishness

41
00:09:04,322 --> 00:09:06,687
Let me talk to her.
- Sure

42
00:09:07,322 --> 00:09:09,221
Talk to your daddy

43
00:09:13,254 --> 00:09:16,422
What am I hearing, Anita?
- Actually Daddy...

44
00:09:19,254 --> 00:09:24,553
And get this very clear.
Obey whatever Mr Kaul orders

45
00:09:25,254 --> 00:09:28,653
Not only a question of your life, dear,
it's a matter of India's honour too

46
00:09:29,019 --> 00:09:31,888
If you are harmed, our country's
security system will be mocked at

47
00:09:32,288 --> 00:09:33,221
Understand?
- Yes

48
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:35,388
I don't want anymore complaints

49
00:09:37,019 --> 00:09:39,019
Not anymore. Promise

50
00:09:44,288 --> 00:09:51,019
Forgive me, uncle. Trust me, I won't
defy your officers' orders anymore

51
00:09:51,388 --> 00:09:55,620
I will do just as they ask me to. But
don't cancel your trip back to India

52
00:09:55,985 --> 00:09:58,052
If the wedding is called off,
it will break hearts

53
00:09:58,421 --> 00:10:00,385
And I'll be held responsible

54
00:10:01,452 --> 00:10:07,653
Our commandos are placed all around,
within 12 kilometres of this bungalow

55
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:12,052
Should the enemy try to penetrate,
it will mean inviting its own death

56
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:16,086
I will stay within limits,
but you must go to India

57
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:20,485
I feel like giving you a tight slap

58
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:29,485
This is a great responsibility
that I entrust you, Amarjeet Singh

59
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,485
And I hope you will live up
to my expectations

60
00:10:33,451 --> 00:10:35,451
I won't betray your trust

61
00:10:38,253 --> 00:10:41,586
What's your plan?
- May I come with your to the airport?

62
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,820
All right, come on

63
00:10:49,351 --> 00:10:52,485
Who else do you have at home, uncle?

64
00:10:54,119 --> 00:10:57,653
There's a lady who bosses me around,
my wife

65
00:10:58,351 --> 00:11:00,787
And I have a son, Ajay

66
00:11:02,086 --> 00:11:04,086
What does Ajay do?

67
00:11:04,552 --> 00:11:09,485
I'm still trying to figure out
what he does and what he tries to do

68
00:11:10,119 --> 00:11:14,951
He does not want what I want. And
I don't understand the things he does

69
00:11:15,384 --> 00:11:16,451
Things like?

70
00:11:44,418 --> 00:11:46,686
Everywhere they go,
they rule

71
00:11:47,085 --> 00:11:49,018
They win over every heart

72
00:11:49,418 --> 00:11:51,652
Whether it is for a beauty
or for their country...

73
00:11:52,018 --> 00:11:53,985
their love is true forever

74
00:11:54,418 --> 00:11:56,384
They are number one
in everything they do

75
00:11:57,451 --> 00:12:01,149
Indians, the lion-hearted ones

76
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:43,984
Nehru and Gandhi...

77
00:12:44,884 --> 00:12:46,551
raised a storm

78
00:12:47,451 --> 00:12:48,984
To every martyr...

79
00:12:50,017 --> 00:12:51,417
I salute

80
00:12:52,451 --> 00:12:56,750
Bhagat Singh and Udham Singh
were soldiers who rebelled

81
00:12:57,950 --> 00:13:01,883
Indians, the lion-hearted ones

82
00:13:27,517 --> 00:13:31,916
Our Mother Theresa
spread the message of peace

83
00:13:32,947 --> 00:13:36,782
Our Queen of Jhansi
found martyrdom

84
00:13:38,014 --> 00:13:42,149
No foe could stand
against Rana Pratap

85
00:13:43,283 --> 00:13:47,481
Indians, the lion-hearted ones

86
00:14:18,316 --> 00:14:20,014
Lord Ram, the great archer...

87
00:14:20,947 --> 00:14:22,615
Lord Krishna, the mesmerizer...

88
00:14:23,315 --> 00:14:25,048
our bagful of benevolence...

89
00:14:25,715 --> 00:14:27,514
our bagful of pride

90
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:32,514
Our soil is golden,
our water is elixir

91
00:14:33,615 --> 00:14:37,980
Indians, the lion-hearted ones

92
00:15:01,581 --> 00:15:05,779
Indians, sweet Indians

93
00:15:11,413 --> 00:15:13,114
Indian boys...

94
00:15:14,047 --> 00:15:15,581
and Indian girls...

95
00:15:16,379 --> 00:15:18,081
have sweet voice...

96
00:15:18,745 --> 00:15:20,580
their aura so sweet

97
00:15:21,413 --> 00:15:25,714
Every couple here is exemplary

98
00:15:26,613 --> 00:15:31,080
Indians, the lion-hearted ones

99
00:15:36,613 --> 00:15:40,245
Everywhere they go,
they rule

100
00:15:41,647 --> 00:15:45,745
They win over every heart

101
00:15:46,644 --> 00:15:49,047
Whether it is for a beauty
or for their country...

102
00:15:49,346 --> 00:15:51,346
their love is true forever

103
00:15:51,711 --> 00:15:53,745
They are number one
in everything they do

104
00:15:54,514 --> 00:15:58,846
Indians, the lion-hearted ones

105
00:15:59,644 --> 00:16:03,913
Indians, the lion-hearted ones

106
00:16:20,677 --> 00:16:21,979
Lions

107
00:16:23,278 --> 00:16:26,312
Ajay, you are an amazing singer,
you are a sensation is this city

108
00:16:26,677 --> 00:16:29,644
Why don't you cut an album?
- You know very well that...

109
00:16:30,013 --> 00:16:33,745
to cut an album is no child's play.
And I don't dance so well

110
00:16:34,812 --> 00:16:36,677
Well, when did you return from Delhi?

111
00:16:37,046 --> 00:16:39,644
Today morning.
I wanted to give you a surprise

112
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:45,010
Your articles, news report,
investigative stories are just amazing

113
00:16:45,479 --> 00:16:50,677
How do you manage to meet those guys
whose whereabouts are hardly known?

114
00:16:51,077 --> 00:16:54,010
It's tough.
It takes months to trace one man

115
00:16:54,576 --> 00:16:56,677
But ultimately, you manage
to find some way or the other

116
00:17:02,711 --> 00:17:06,010
Brother, you got to go to the station
to receive Father. Remember?

117
00:17:06,444 --> 00:17:09,345
Yes, I do.
- The train arrives at 4pm

118
00:17:09,711 --> 00:17:12,478
Be there on time.
- I'll be there at four

119
00:17:14,711 --> 00:17:18,743
Hey, it's about to be four.
Alok, I'll catch you later

120
00:17:21,743 --> 00:17:23,678
Interview stalled once again

121
00:17:49,644 --> 00:17:51,211
Whose veil is this?

122
00:17:52,544 --> 00:17:54,211
Whose veil is this?

123
00:17:56,777 --> 00:17:59,544
What are you watching?
Who does it belong to? Tell me

124
00:18:02,576 --> 00:18:06,911
Whose veil is this?
Can't you take care of your veil?

125
00:18:07,644 --> 00:18:11,875
All right, whoever it belongs to,
come and take it

126
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:15,844
Excuse me... it's mine

127
00:18:16,477 --> 00:18:18,242
You are so careless

128
00:18:18,777 --> 00:18:24,144
Can't you take care of a veil? Do you
know what it has done to my motorcycle?

129
00:18:24,808 --> 00:18:29,210
I'm a teacher in a nearby school.
While I was crossing the road...

130
00:18:29,576 --> 00:18:33,175
the sudden breeze blew my umbrella.
I was trying to hold it...

131
00:18:33,541 --> 00:18:35,942
when my veil flew off
and you fell down

132
00:18:36,576 --> 00:18:39,442
Strange! Isn't your veil
more important?

133
00:18:39,808 --> 00:18:43,108
I guess you know what a veil
means for a girl?

134
00:18:47,808 --> 00:18:51,175
Yes. I'm sorry, forgive me

135
00:18:52,808 --> 00:18:55,108
My veil...
- Here you are

136
00:19:25,607 --> 00:19:28,209
See? My son is not here as yet

137
00:19:29,607 --> 00:19:34,040
Despite the train being
delayed by half-hour. Ridiculous

138
00:19:37,642 --> 00:19:40,508
Sardarji, will you go to Mashobra?
- Sure

139
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:45,508
Past the Yellow Mansion, to the end
of the road. Don't crib later

140
00:19:45,875 --> 00:19:49,009
Uncle-ji, I'll drop you
wherever you say

141
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:56,008
Uncle-ji, you remember me?
You have travelled in my cab before

142
00:19:56,641 --> 00:19:59,875
My name is Sukhwinder Billa.
- Sukhwinder Billa?

143
00:20:00,275 --> 00:20:02,839
Yes. They call me Singer Billa

144
00:20:04,008 --> 00:20:07,875
The door opened on its own!
- Shut it before you fall off

145
00:20:08,275 --> 00:20:12,275
I'm Ajay's disciple,
I never miss his performance

146
00:20:12,906 --> 00:20:15,539
I spend all my earnings on his shows

147
00:20:15,906 --> 00:20:21,208
Why don't you send Ajay to Bombay?
He'll cut an album and become a star

148
00:20:21,673 --> 00:20:25,472
I have thought up
a name for myself for the album

149
00:20:25,972 --> 00:20:29,272
Name for an album?
- Yes. Singer Billa Brandy

150
00:20:29,673 --> 00:20:34,272
Singer Billa Brandy?
- Yes. And I have composed a song too

151
00:20:34,673 --> 00:20:36,539
O my car, take me to Patiala...

152
00:20:36,906 --> 00:20:38,440
Stop it, will you?

153
00:20:41,807 --> 00:20:45,605
Is it a car or a piece of junk?
- Shut the door!

154
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:50,472
The handle came off.
- Never mind. You like my song?

155
00:20:50,839 --> 00:20:51,905
Junk

156
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:55,338
Hi Ajay.
Your father took Billa's cab

157
00:20:55,707 --> 00:20:59,007
Billa's cab?
He's going to drive Father crazy!

158
00:20:59,405 --> 00:21:01,271
Pull over.
- Like my song?

159
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,141
Pull over.
- Another song?

160
00:21:03,507 --> 00:21:06,007
I say, stop!
- Hear another song I composed

161
00:21:06,404 --> 00:21:08,038
You chew my brains!

162
00:21:09,373 --> 00:21:11,707
Your scream just like your car

163
00:21:14,838 --> 00:21:19,740
Uncle, you mustn't be angry.
You are Ajay's daddy, my guru's daddy

164
00:21:21,073 --> 00:21:22,940
Ajay can only be a guru
to an ass like you

165
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:26,271
I'll take the luggage.
- Don't touch it, lay off

166
00:21:30,971 --> 00:21:32,940
Uncle-ji is angry

167
00:21:37,971 --> 00:21:41,105
I hope we didn't
leave Mashobra behind

168
00:22:05,939 --> 00:22:10,172
Actually, in trying to save my veil and
umbrella, I lost hold of my umbrella

169
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:13,403
You said my veil is more important

170
00:22:16,006 --> 00:22:18,372
You are hurt

171
00:23:03,871 --> 00:23:05,702
There's a limit to carelessness

172
00:23:07,769 --> 00:23:12,502
I'm still strong enough. He didn't
have to carry me from the station

173
00:23:13,769 --> 00:23:17,368
It just feels nice to see my son
coming to receive me at the station

174
00:23:23,537 --> 00:23:25,836
Please forget it, Father.
Brother is here

175
00:23:27,836 --> 00:23:29,038
Indeed

176
00:23:32,935 --> 00:23:34,568
Where were you?

177
00:23:36,804 --> 00:23:37,871
Bless you

178
00:23:38,237 --> 00:23:42,470
Father, I was going to the station
to pick you up, but on the way...

179
00:23:42,836 --> 00:23:46,435
What happened on the way?
- Ma, a veil flew out of nowhere...

180
00:23:46,804 --> 00:23:50,868
and landed on my face, and I lost
balance. But I'm not hurt much

181
00:23:51,269 --> 00:23:54,701
What happened? How could this happen?
- It's only a scratch

182
00:23:55,103 --> 00:23:59,403
I managed somehow and saved myself
from a terrible accident

183
00:24:00,134 --> 00:24:03,201
Anyway, the girl was pretty I guess?
- Yes, Ma

184
00:24:03,634 --> 00:24:08,434
That explains it. The sight of
the girl must've sent him in a tizzy

185
00:24:08,935 --> 00:24:13,336
Then who cares who is arriving.
Hardly makes a difference

186
00:24:13,701 --> 00:24:17,769
No sweat. He rams into
a beautiful girl who enchants him

187
00:24:18,134 --> 00:24:20,769
So what's the problem?
- Nothing of that sort, Ma

188
00:24:21,134 --> 00:24:23,169
I'm over her

189
00:24:33,169 --> 00:24:35,867
You said my veil
is more important to me

190
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:41,934
You are hurt

191
00:25:40,933 --> 00:25:42,866
A girl takes over my heart

192
00:25:43,267 --> 00:25:45,799
As if life
breathes into my heartbeats

193
00:25:46,232 --> 00:25:48,365
She has driven me crazy

194
00:25:48,768 --> 00:25:51,267
She has driven me insane

195
00:25:51,701 --> 00:25:54,732
Her eyes are so intoxicating

196
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:09,834
A girl takes over my heart

197
00:26:10,232 --> 00:26:13,601
As if life
breathes into my heartbeats

198
00:26:37,567 --> 00:26:42,567
Everywhere I see only her

199
00:26:43,066 --> 00:26:48,031
My heart is hysteric,
I'm sleepless

200
00:26:59,164 --> 00:27:01,266
In the garden of my heart,
flowers blossoms...

201
00:27:01,633 --> 00:27:04,266
now that a girl
takes over my heart

202
00:27:04,633 --> 00:27:06,700
She has driven me crazy

203
00:27:07,066 --> 00:27:09,699
She has driven me insane

204
00:27:10,097 --> 00:27:13,266
Her eyes are so intoxicating

205
00:27:58,365 --> 00:28:00,829
Her tresses, of the night

206
00:28:01,265 --> 00:28:03,596
Her face, of sunshine

207
00:28:03,998 --> 00:28:09,131
It appears as if the clouds
have spread over the moon

208
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:22,230
I gave my heart away
almost at once...

209
00:28:22,631 --> 00:28:25,131
the moment she sought

210
00:28:25,596 --> 00:28:27,765
She has driven me crazy

211
00:28:28,163 --> 00:28:30,663
She has driven me insane

212
00:28:31,163 --> 00:28:34,364
Her eyes are so intoxicating

213
00:28:57,997 --> 00:29:00,596
A girl has taken over my heart

214
00:29:33,229 --> 00:29:34,163
Greetings

215
00:29:41,394 --> 00:29:43,429
Hi Neha.
- What kept you, Ashu?

216
00:29:43,729 --> 00:29:45,563
Extra classes

217
00:30:40,595 --> 00:30:41,661
Brother...?

218
00:30:45,394 --> 00:30:47,461
Brother!
- How are you, Neha?

219
00:30:49,326 --> 00:30:53,861
You were supposed to come on 10th.
- Yes, but I got 4 more days of leave

220
00:30:54,228 --> 00:30:57,326
So I came over.
- Looks like Chandigarh suits you

221
00:30:57,692 --> 00:31:00,759
You have put on some weight.
- A little. Let's go

222
00:31:36,594 --> 00:31:38,726
What are you looking at, gentleman?

223
00:31:39,559 --> 00:31:41,991
You stay around here?
- Right. So?

224
00:31:42,358 --> 00:31:44,326
Can you tell me who owns that house?

225
00:31:45,394 --> 00:31:47,326
It's mine. Any problem?

226
00:31:47,759 --> 00:31:50,259
I see. The owner of the house
sends you to scare me out of there

227
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:53,893
So Suresh-bhai has stooped down to
hooliganism. I failed to pay...

228
00:31:54,259 --> 00:31:56,991
two months' rent, so what? The house is
still there, I haven't taken it away

229
00:31:57,358 --> 00:31:59,960
I will pay up next month, tell him.
- You are taking me wrong

230
00:32:00,326 --> 00:32:03,726
Really? Useless chaps like you
do nothing more than this these days

231
00:32:04,093 --> 00:32:07,160
But I'm a free citizen of
a free country. You can't threaten me

232
00:32:07,791 --> 00:32:11,692
Which house am I talking about?
- The one where a carpet is hung

233
00:32:12,057 --> 00:32:15,125
No, I'm talking about the next one

234
00:32:15,592 --> 00:32:18,259
It belongs to Mr Sharma. So?
- I came here to meet Mr Sharma

235
00:32:18,625 --> 00:32:22,026
So go and meet him. He doesn't
stay there, it is always locked

236
00:32:22,393 --> 00:32:26,659
Everyone comes asking me about him.
Big problem. Sharma, the sonofagun!

237
00:32:35,393 --> 00:32:39,759
Ajay, don't be engaged tomorrow
morning. You will be with me all day

238
00:32:44,326 --> 00:32:47,159
I have to meet someone
at nine tomorrow, Father

239
00:32:47,625 --> 00:32:49,424
The wedding is at hand

240
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:52,758
Tomorrow we got to place the orders
for the catering and the wedding altar

241
00:32:53,656 --> 00:32:56,392
Tomorrow morning is impossible.
We'll go around 3 o'clock

242
00:32:57,790 --> 00:32:59,723
But she leaves at three!

243
00:33:00,656 --> 00:33:03,290
Who leaves?
- Nothing, Father

244
00:33:03,656 --> 00:33:08,057
I can't go with you. I have organised
everything for the wedding, anyway

245
00:33:08,423 --> 00:33:13,923
Everything is done.
- You are coming with me. Period

246
00:33:38,691 --> 00:33:39,856
Yes Father

247
00:33:41,691 --> 00:33:45,057
Come, young man. Ready?

248
00:33:45,691 --> 00:33:49,156
Let's go.
- But Father, I told you...

249
00:33:49,522 --> 00:33:52,655
I got to see someone at nine.
I can't go with you today

250
00:33:53,057 --> 00:33:58,124
I doubted that last night itself.
That's why I've been sitting...

251
00:33:58,490 --> 00:34:03,855
on this motorcycle since seven.
I read the entire paper sitting here

252
00:34:04,457 --> 00:34:07,222
I even had breakfast
on the motorcycle

253
00:34:07,855 --> 00:34:11,422
Why are you insisting, Father?
I have to meet someone at nine

254
00:34:11,824 --> 00:34:17,356
No sweat. Let's place the orders first
at Pannalal's, then you can go and meet

255
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:22,356
I'll meet, too.
- Father, it is already 8:30

256
00:34:22,722 --> 00:34:26,356
It'll take 25 minutes to reach
Pannalal's, you will chat with him...

257
00:34:26,722 --> 00:34:29,690
for half-hour.
Then how will I reach on time?

258
00:34:30,056 --> 00:34:33,456
All right, but let's go
to Pannalal's first. Sit

259
00:34:34,755 --> 00:34:37,456
Sit, will you?
- Ma!

260
00:34:38,523 --> 00:34:40,456
What are looking at?
Come and sit

261
00:34:45,655 --> 00:34:49,722
What is it?
- Take a good look at him

262
00:34:52,755 --> 00:34:54,056
What does it mean?

263
00:34:55,521 --> 00:34:56,521
Careful

264
00:34:58,521 --> 00:34:59,521
Slow

265
00:35:04,755 --> 00:35:06,056
Watch it

266
00:35:06,989 --> 00:35:12,056
You love it, Father, don't you?
You used to enjoy the way I drove

267
00:35:12,554 --> 00:35:14,889
But it appears like you are
old enough to get scared

268
00:35:15,322 --> 00:35:20,222
I'm not scared, son. But where
is the need to drive so fast?

269
00:35:20,588 --> 00:35:24,155
Father, my motorcycle doesn't
get any slower

270
00:35:24,521 --> 00:35:25,889
Watch this

271
00:35:26,789 --> 00:35:29,387
Go slow on the slope, Ajay!

272
00:35:29,822 --> 00:35:35,322
Father, I jog 12 kilometres daily.
I take total care of my health

273
00:35:35,688 --> 00:35:40,054
I meditate for an hour everyday.
Watch my command over the motorcycle

274
00:35:42,121 --> 00:35:44,755
Look, my hands are free.
- Hands on the handle!

275
00:35:45,289 --> 00:35:47,454
Put your hands down!
- Isn't it fun, Father?

276
00:35:47,822 --> 00:35:51,255
Grab it!
- Watch this lovely cut

277
00:35:54,887 --> 00:35:55,887
Take this

278
00:35:57,820 --> 00:36:00,954
Father, another lovely cut

279
00:36:03,288 --> 00:36:04,788
It's fun, isn't it?

280
00:36:05,521 --> 00:36:07,588
Isn't it fun, Father?
- Real fun, of course!

281
00:36:07,954 --> 00:36:10,788
It's a routine, Father.
- Grab the handle!

282
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:16,454
See that, Father?
- I will, only if I can see anything

283
00:36:16,853 --> 00:36:22,255
All I can think of is that Pannalal's
shop seems too far all of a sudden

284
00:36:22,621 --> 00:36:26,255
Pannalal's shop?
Here we go

285
00:36:30,621 --> 00:36:34,121
Open your eyes, Father.
Pannalal's shop is here

286
00:36:45,887 --> 00:36:50,152
Well Father, are you reeling?
Does everything seem to go round?

287
00:36:50,887 --> 00:36:54,253
Oh come on, I was only joking

288
00:36:55,619 --> 00:36:57,652
You look good when you are joking

289
00:36:58,085 --> 00:37:01,853
In fact, I'm really good

290
00:37:02,221 --> 00:37:05,485
Try me. You will be
with me all day, right?

291
00:37:05,887 --> 00:37:10,853
All right, stay here, I'll be
right back. Don't you move

292
00:37:55,952 --> 00:37:59,318
One Neha teaches here...
- You mean Neha Pandit?

293
00:37:59,818 --> 00:38:04,518
Yes... Neha Pandit. Can I meet her?
- She's absent today, she's unwell

294
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:06,152
Unwell?

295
00:38:57,885 --> 00:38:59,617
What...? What are you doing?

296
00:39:01,117 --> 00:39:04,217
I found out at your school that
you are unwell, so I...

297
00:39:04,650 --> 00:39:08,550
Why did you come to my house?
Please go away

298
00:39:09,483 --> 00:39:10,483
Look...

299
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:14,150
I need to talk to you.
- Father should be here any moment

300
00:39:14,684 --> 00:39:16,483
If he sees you here...

301
00:39:21,951 --> 00:39:26,617
Father is here. Please go away.
I'll be in trouble if he sees you here

302
00:39:27,016 --> 00:39:29,750
But I need to talk to you...
- We can talk tomorrow

303
00:39:30,117 --> 00:39:33,650
Go for now.
- At Mount View at 2 tomorrow

304
00:39:34,050 --> 00:39:37,650
I'll be there. Go for now, please.
- I'll wait

305
00:39:43,181 --> 00:39:45,516
Why did you enter my house?
- Mr Sharma...

306
00:39:45,916 --> 00:39:49,114
Didn't I show you his house?
- No way

307
00:39:49,483 --> 00:39:53,681
You showed me this house. You may not
remember, but I'm pretty sure...

308
00:39:54,050 --> 00:39:56,681
you showed this one.
- What nonsense!

309
00:39:57,050 --> 00:40:00,148
Am I crazy to show my house
as Sharma's house?

310
00:40:00,782 --> 00:40:04,849
How would I know your problem? But you
showed this one as Mr Sharma's house

311
00:40:05,215 --> 00:40:10,416
I showed you that one.
Can't you see that big nameplate?

312
00:40:10,815 --> 00:40:13,050
Look there.
- I just didn't notice that...

313
00:40:13,416 --> 00:40:16,815
because you indicated this house.
And how could I doubt you?

314
00:40:17,181 --> 00:40:21,983
Because you don't look like a liar,
you can't pull someone's leg either

315
00:40:22,349 --> 00:40:24,315
All right, my mistake, forgive me

316
00:40:24,681 --> 00:40:27,547
Now you know Sharma's house,
don't you? It's that one

317
00:40:32,849 --> 00:40:35,648
Yes. I can see the nameplate
as well as the lock

318
00:40:36,849 --> 00:40:38,547
Bye. See you later

319
00:40:43,648 --> 00:40:47,581
This guy is bad.
Sharma, you have ruined my life!

320
00:40:48,114 --> 00:40:50,849
Bye, Mr Pannalal.
- Bye

321
00:41:01,114 --> 00:41:05,315
Ajay, let me ride.
You be the pillion

322
00:41:06,114 --> 00:41:07,081
Fine, Father

323
00:41:12,914 --> 00:41:14,581
Sat?
- The gear is down there

324
00:41:17,014 --> 00:41:18,914
That's the brake.
- I know

325
00:41:20,947 --> 00:41:23,114
Are you ready?
- Yes Father

326
00:41:23,447 --> 00:41:26,581
Then hold on tight.
- Here I go

327
00:41:26,981 --> 00:41:28,114
Now watch!

328
00:41:40,181 --> 00:41:43,547
Father, this slow pace is
humiliating to my motorcycle

329
00:41:43,914 --> 00:41:46,547
We'll reach home tomorrow.
- Is that so?

330
00:41:46,947 --> 00:41:50,114
Of course.
- Then let's take a short-cut

331
00:41:50,581 --> 00:41:53,313
Father! What are you doing?
It's a dusty track

332
00:41:53,914 --> 00:41:58,280
So what's wrong?
- Father, it's not tarred

333
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:05,947
Father, trust me, let me drive.
The road is not tarred

334
00:42:06,347 --> 00:42:10,614
But son, I'm strong enough.
I have seen enough of your cuts

335
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:13,947
Now watch my jumps. Take that

336
00:42:20,045 --> 00:42:21,280
Fun, isn't it?
- Of course

337
00:42:21,679 --> 00:42:25,612
Now watch the best jump of mine.
- I've seen it, Father!

338
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:32,512
Let me drive it, Father, please

339
00:42:34,945 --> 00:42:37,978
Now watch my balance and command

340
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:40,346
Hands on the handle, Father!

341
00:42:41,945 --> 00:42:44,179
What are you doing, Father?
Hands down, please!

342
00:42:49,012 --> 00:42:52,780
Father, watch ahead!

343
00:42:53,277 --> 00:42:55,846
It's only a bump

344
00:42:57,612 --> 00:43:00,012
Hold on tight, son

345
00:43:06,813 --> 00:43:08,777
We're home, son

346
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:16,210
Let go of me now.
Come on, let go

347
00:43:20,112 --> 00:43:26,945
How do things appear, son?
Round?

348
00:43:28,277 --> 00:43:30,777
Look at you! You are frazzled

349
00:43:31,077 --> 00:43:36,010
And you say you jog 12 kilometres
and meditate

350
00:43:38,277 --> 00:43:42,244
Darling, feed him some dry fruits

351
00:43:55,277 --> 00:43:57,744
I was confident you'd come

352
00:43:59,277 --> 00:44:01,978
My heart kept throbbing
to say Neha will surely come

353
00:44:04,311 --> 00:44:07,445
Look, the thing on your mind
cannot come true

354
00:44:08,210 --> 00:44:09,277
Why not?

355
00:44:11,210 --> 00:44:13,077
Because I'm married

356
00:44:21,311 --> 00:44:24,077
My husband is no more

357
00:44:26,244 --> 00:44:28,610
But we're here, baby

358
00:44:29,077 --> 00:44:30,277
Of course

359
00:44:32,110 --> 00:44:35,077
If you got space,
give us some

360
00:44:39,443 --> 00:44:44,110
Not a car, she is
the wine of Shimla

361
00:44:54,143 --> 00:44:56,643
Let's get out of here, please

362
00:44:58,510 --> 00:45:00,309
Where to, lady?

363
00:45:10,175 --> 00:45:12,543
Bye.
- Let me drop you

364
00:45:13,076 --> 00:45:14,342
No, thanks

365
00:45:15,376 --> 00:45:17,876
Your house is on the way,
I'll drop you

366
00:45:18,242 --> 00:45:22,342
Why must you bother?
- Are you scared to sit with me?

367
00:45:23,143 --> 00:45:26,143
Nothing of that sort.
- Then come on

368
00:45:53,208 --> 00:45:55,708
Drop me here, I'll walk

369
00:45:56,409 --> 00:45:58,376
No need to worry when I'm with you

370
00:46:28,442 --> 00:46:31,108
That guy is strange!
- Who? Mr Sharma?

371
00:46:31,507 --> 00:46:36,175
Bloody R. K Sharma! Had I found him
today, I'd have abused him

372
00:46:37,375 --> 00:46:39,940
I've been waiting since two hours.
He fooled me

373
00:46:40,306 --> 00:46:46,208
He has driven me insane! If you meet
him, tell him that I'm really angry...

374
00:46:46,641 --> 00:46:50,440
whether he comes in the evening, night
or day. You will not sleep tonight

375
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:53,507
You will not go to work tomorrow.
You will do only my job

376
00:46:55,208 --> 00:46:57,108
What are you staring at?

377
00:46:57,474 --> 00:47:00,440
I'll come again and ask you
whether you have informed him or not

378
00:47:02,474 --> 00:47:04,440
Step aside, will you?

379
00:47:08,239 --> 00:47:11,106
To hell with your Sharma!
And why will I stay up all night?

380
00:47:11,474 --> 00:47:14,007
What do you mean to me?
And what does Sharma mean to me?

381
00:47:14,608 --> 00:47:17,840
He orders me as if I'm his servant

382
00:47:18,206 --> 00:47:20,440
Good that he went before I got mad,
else I'd have given him one rap

383
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:22,106
Excuse me...
- Shut up!

384
00:47:22,507 --> 00:47:24,239
You want to know about Sharma, right?
- Yes...

385
00:47:24,507 --> 00:47:28,273
Sharma is dead. His last rites have
been performed. He's in heaven now

386
00:47:28,641 --> 00:47:32,806
I'm going to stone anyone
who dares to ask me about Sharma!

387
00:47:59,539 --> 00:48:01,472
Hurry up, will you?
- Trying

388
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:18,672
I'll make a racing car out of you

389
00:48:32,637 --> 00:48:34,572
Why are you here?
- We found out that...

390
00:48:34,972 --> 00:48:38,804
the police have arrested Ajay, so...
- Did you have to deck yourselves up?

391
00:48:39,637 --> 00:48:42,338
Are you here to bail him out
or have you come on his wedding?

392
00:48:43,572 --> 00:48:44,539
Come on

393
00:48:52,570 --> 00:48:55,304
Welcome, Mr Kaul.
- Well...

394
00:48:56,570 --> 00:48:59,105
I had to see this day
too because of you

395
00:48:59,472 --> 00:49:01,438
I have to come to the police station
to bail you out

396
00:49:01,704 --> 00:49:05,971
Nothing of that sort has happened,
Mr Kaul. No bail, it's only formality

397
00:49:06,338 --> 00:49:08,905
Just sign here.
- Later

398
00:49:09,371 --> 00:49:14,172
Ask him why he did this?
- Father, they were teasing a girl

399
00:49:14,603 --> 00:49:17,137
I see. A girl here too?

400
00:49:18,105 --> 00:49:21,038
There's a girl behind
every story of yours

401
00:49:21,603 --> 00:49:23,771
Is this the girl with the veil?

402
00:49:24,505 --> 00:49:29,038
Mr Kaul, he is right.
The guys he hit were goons

403
00:49:29,405 --> 00:49:32,237
They have nothing to do
but eve-teasing

404
00:49:32,603 --> 00:49:37,570
But it's not his job to take on goons.
The city has policemen

405
00:49:38,438 --> 00:49:41,971
Ask him to swear that
he won't hit anyone again

406
00:49:42,637 --> 00:49:43,737
Go on

407
00:49:45,637 --> 00:49:48,271
I won't hit anyone.
- He said it. Okay? Now sign fast

408
00:49:48,637 --> 00:49:50,603
Got to go home,
my son is hungry

409
00:49:53,835 --> 00:49:55,704
Son is hungry!
- Hurry up

410
00:50:16,536 --> 00:50:19,237
Ajay! You are incorrigible!

411
00:50:19,670 --> 00:50:22,835
You raised your hand again!
- Father, he stared at me

412
00:50:23,670 --> 00:50:25,835
He promised, didn't he?
- Yes

413
00:50:27,670 --> 00:50:30,436
I forgot. I forgot, Ma.
- He forgot, he says

414
00:50:31,668 --> 00:50:32,635
Come on

415
00:50:38,835 --> 00:50:41,802
Today you have to distribute these
invitation cards for the wedding

416
00:50:42,501 --> 00:50:46,335
And look, deliver it personally.
- Sure

417
00:50:46,702 --> 00:50:50,335
And... for Mr Sharma,
I will go and invite him personally

418
00:50:50,835 --> 00:50:54,469
Which Sharma?
- My friend R. K Sharma

419
00:50:54,969 --> 00:50:57,835
Sector 2, B block, Cant Area,
Cottage 39?

420
00:51:00,168 --> 00:51:02,003
How do you know him?

421
00:51:02,568 --> 00:51:06,369
Father, I know him very well.
I will go and give it myself

422
00:51:06,835 --> 00:51:10,467
That's fine, but I want to go
and personally invite him

423
00:51:10,835 --> 00:51:13,101
He's a special friend.
- Whether I go or you...

424
00:51:13,467 --> 00:51:15,934
it's one and the same. Mr Sharma
will definitely attend the wedding

425
00:51:16,434 --> 00:51:18,168
I will deliver the card

426
00:51:18,668 --> 00:51:21,902
Why is he so excited to deliver
the card to Mr Sharma?

427
00:51:23,835 --> 00:51:25,034
I smell a rat

428
00:51:31,568 --> 00:51:33,235
You! Not again!

429
00:51:43,867 --> 00:51:44,835
Move it!

430
00:51:53,568 --> 00:51:56,501
This guy is bad!
Sharma, you...!

431
00:52:14,567 --> 00:52:18,268
Here you are. My sister's wedding.
You must come

432
00:52:18,766 --> 00:52:21,300
Please don't refuse.
You will come, won't you?

433
00:52:37,666 --> 00:52:41,001
Congratulation, Mr Kaul.
It was a grand wedding

434
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:44,833
And you found a gem of a son-in-law.
- Thank you very much, Mr Gupta

435
00:52:45,201 --> 00:52:47,364
But your son Ajay is not to be seen

436
00:52:50,666 --> 00:52:52,099
Congratulations.
- Congratulations

437
00:52:57,599 --> 00:52:59,532
Yes Father?
- You invited Mr Sharma, didn't you?

438
00:52:59,931 --> 00:53:03,465
I'm waiting for him, Father.
I'm more tensed than you

439
00:53:03,833 --> 00:53:08,498
All right, I'll wait here. There's
a girl on stage asking for you. Go on

440
00:53:10,931 --> 00:53:12,132
Congratulations

441
00:53:29,233 --> 00:53:31,498
When did you arrive?
- Just a while ago

442
00:53:31,864 --> 00:53:33,797
I was waiting for you at the gate

443
00:53:35,266 --> 00:53:38,498
Good you came, else...
- We go uninvited to offer gifts...

444
00:53:38,864 --> 00:53:41,431
when girls in our families
get married

445
00:53:42,666 --> 00:53:44,364
Besides, you had invited me

446
00:53:46,666 --> 00:53:50,831
I must leave now.
- What! You haven't had anything yet

447
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:54,998
It'll be too late,
there's no one at home either

448
00:53:55,632 --> 00:53:59,632
Okay, let me drop you home then.
- But the wedding...

449
00:54:00,664 --> 00:54:02,965
No problem. I'll hurry back

450
00:54:14,898 --> 00:54:17,364
Well...
- What's wrong?

451
00:54:17,764 --> 00:54:18,731
No idea

452
00:54:21,132 --> 00:54:22,099
What happened?

453
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:31,032
I filled the tank this morning,
I don't know how it ran out of gas

454
00:54:31,731 --> 00:54:36,664
Now what?
- Let's take a lift

455
00:54:38,965 --> 00:54:40,697
I'll try that car

456
00:54:58,931 --> 00:55:02,230
So this is what you are upto? You
sell off your shame and freak out...

457
00:55:02,597 --> 00:55:06,329
with a hooligan at this hour?
You bring my honour to the street?

458
00:55:06,697 --> 00:55:08,630
Look...
- Shut up! I'm not talking to you

459
00:55:08,963 --> 00:55:11,563
How could you pull wool over my eyes?
Not even a year has passed...

460
00:55:11,963 --> 00:55:14,496
since my son died, and you
have begun showing your true colours!

461
00:55:14,963 --> 00:55:17,130
Let go of my hand and get lost

462
00:55:17,764 --> 00:55:20,630
Come on, I'll deal with you at home

463
00:55:28,730 --> 00:55:32,730
Reason with him. This song-n-dance
is not going to carve his future

464
00:55:34,362 --> 00:55:36,597
It's been six months
since he trained to become a commando

465
00:55:36,963 --> 00:55:38,929
Why doesn't he join and work with me?

466
00:55:40,996 --> 00:55:45,228
What's wrong with you now?
Why have you pulled a long face?

467
00:55:45,996 --> 00:55:49,630
It's nothing, Father.
- Heed me, it's in your own interest

468
00:55:49,996 --> 00:55:52,262
It's not easy to find a job
these days

469
00:55:52,896 --> 00:55:55,295
I'll make him see reasons,
he will join you

470
00:55:56,996 --> 00:55:59,161
All right Sudha. Bye

471
00:56:02,996 --> 00:56:04,063
Bless you

472
00:56:12,896 --> 00:56:15,527
You are fine, aren't you, dear?
- I am

473
00:56:23,829 --> 00:56:25,996
Miss Neha?
She has stopped teaching

474
00:56:37,096 --> 00:56:38,327
Ajay here

475
00:56:39,096 --> 00:56:41,362
How dare you call my house?

476
00:56:41,795 --> 00:56:45,427
I need to talk to you.
- But I don't want to talk you

477
00:56:45,896 --> 00:56:49,460
I'm coming home to meet you.
- Step into the neighbourhood...

478
00:56:49,862 --> 00:56:50,929
and you will be at great loss.
- I'll be there soon

479
00:57:15,128 --> 00:57:16,293
Stop there

480
00:58:54,559 --> 00:58:56,793
You're the one who's saying
wrong things! What's the problem?

481
00:58:57,025 --> 00:58:58,925
My sister's going to settle down,
her life will be made

482
00:58:59,192 --> 00:59:01,925
Ajay is a good boy. He comes
from a nice family and you...

483
00:59:02,192 --> 00:59:06,391
Don't tell me what's good and bad!
Your sister is now my daughter-in-law!

484
00:59:06,793 --> 00:59:08,958
She's the pride of this house,
she's not a burden on me

485
00:59:09,192 --> 00:59:11,492
I can't allow this marriage to
take place. And that's final!

486
00:59:11,726 --> 00:59:14,159
I have seen the consequences
of your decisions

487
00:59:15,224 --> 00:59:18,157
Have you ever thought how your
decisions hurt everyone else?

488
00:59:18,525 --> 00:59:21,726
It was a decision of yours that
drove your son to suicide!

489
00:59:22,192 --> 00:59:25,157
She's a widow because of you!

490
00:59:28,458 --> 00:59:30,425
Neha, go to Ajay

491
00:59:31,625 --> 00:59:35,492
As her elder brother, I approve
of this alliance4e

492
00:59:56,023 --> 00:59:58,190
You have all the right to Neha

493
00:59:59,023 --> 01:00:01,989
She's your daughter-in-law
and your daughter too

494
01:00:02,757 --> 01:00:05,391
And thus, only you will decide
about her life

495
01:00:06,757 --> 01:00:10,625
Only if you show trust in me
and give Neha's hand in mine...

496
01:00:10,956 --> 01:00:12,889
will I take her hand

497
01:00:34,257 --> 01:00:36,889
You don't just understand
relationships...

498
01:00:37,257 --> 01:00:39,824
you have respect for them too

499
01:00:41,356 --> 01:00:45,657
I can see your character
because of your beliefs

500
01:00:48,289 --> 01:00:50,222
I approve of this alliance

501
01:01:38,822 --> 01:01:45,623
The love you have given me...

502
01:01:46,422 --> 01:01:52,322
what do you call it?

503
01:01:52,688 --> 01:01:56,088
Love is a feeling
beyond comprehension

504
01:01:56,588 --> 01:01:59,322
It's a thirst that
can never be quenched

505
01:01:59,688 --> 01:02:03,121
Give me the sign of love
with your eyes...

506
01:02:03,521 --> 01:02:06,954
simply call love
by its name, my love

507
01:02:07,355 --> 01:02:10,655
Call it love

508
01:02:15,355 --> 01:02:17,588
What are you thinking about?

509
01:02:18,288 --> 01:02:20,521
Nothing.
- There surely is something

510
01:02:20,853 --> 01:02:24,987
I'm thinking of how you came into
my life, like a gust of wind...

511
01:02:25,387 --> 01:02:29,320
and forged a relationship.
I didn't even realise it

512
01:02:30,387 --> 01:02:33,355
But I took you to heart,
the moment I saw you

513
01:02:34,387 --> 01:02:38,355
The more I got to know about you,
the more determined I grew to have you

514
01:02:39,188 --> 01:02:43,621
I had made up my mind
that I'd have you

515
01:02:44,387 --> 01:02:47,353
And see? I have you today

516
01:02:52,121 --> 01:02:58,387
Lonely, my life was...

517
01:02:59,420 --> 01:03:05,554
tearful, was my happiness

518
01:03:06,688 --> 01:03:11,987
There was an
unsurmountable pain

519
01:03:13,018 --> 01:03:15,987
Your Ionely life, I will embellish

520
01:03:16,420 --> 01:03:19,719
I will lay happiness
in your path

521
01:03:20,152 --> 01:03:23,186
I will show this cruel world...

522
01:03:23,585 --> 01:03:27,186
this promise I will fulfill...

523
01:03:27,554 --> 01:03:30,652
this is a promise
I will fulfill

524
01:03:32,253 --> 01:03:38,420
The love you have given me...

525
01:03:39,452 --> 01:03:44,885
what do you call it?

526
01:03:46,452 --> 01:03:53,018
The love I have given you...

527
01:03:53,918 --> 01:03:59,818
I simply call it love

528
01:04:04,652 --> 01:04:06,952
What are you looking at?
- Your eyes

529
01:04:07,152 --> 01:04:10,085
They were those of a stranger till
recently. They mean the life to me now

530
01:04:10,719 --> 01:04:14,652
You know how it all happened?
- How?

531
01:04:15,719 --> 01:04:18,018
It was because of your scarf

532
01:04:19,485 --> 01:04:22,186
Had it not flown,
had it not covered my face...

533
01:04:22,585 --> 01:04:25,851
had I not fallen...
I'd never have met you

534
01:04:30,485 --> 01:04:36,452
You have given
desires to my heart

535
01:04:37,518 --> 01:04:44,284
I don't know what
you have done to me

536
01:04:44,851 --> 01:04:50,219
My dreams seem to be
coming true

537
01:04:51,052 --> 01:04:54,152
My obsession has
borne fruit, my love...

538
01:04:54,585 --> 01:04:57,985
what was just a joke,
is love now

539
01:04:58,452 --> 01:05:01,485
Not for nothing do
you pine in love...

540
01:05:01,951 --> 01:05:05,284
it's the spell I have cast,
O beloved

541
01:05:05,617 --> 01:05:08,818
O beloved

542
01:05:10,485 --> 01:05:16,884
The love you have given me...

543
01:05:17,552 --> 01:05:23,518
what do you call it?

544
01:05:24,018 --> 01:05:27,184
Love is a feeling
beyond comprehension

545
01:05:27,550 --> 01:05:30,518
It's a thirst that
can never be quenched

546
01:05:30,983 --> 01:05:34,184
Give me the sign of love
with your eyes...

547
01:05:34,684 --> 01:05:38,184
simply call love
by its name, my love

548
01:05:38,550 --> 01:05:41,849
Call it love

549
01:05:42,849 --> 01:05:49,550
The love you have given me...

550
01:05:50,583 --> 01:05:56,217
what do you call it?

551
01:05:57,583 --> 01:06:04,050
The love I have given you...

552
01:06:04,916 --> 01:06:11,550
I simply call it love

553
01:07:01,815 --> 01:07:03,416
Let me go!

554
01:07:05,815 --> 01:07:06,782
Ajay!

555
01:07:09,981 --> 01:07:11,748
Leave me alone!

556
01:08:20,881 --> 01:08:24,314
My name is Junaid Afghani.
From the Wafa Al Afghan

557
01:08:25,912 --> 01:08:27,546
She's in your custody

558
01:08:30,578 --> 01:08:31,947
Hold it

559
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:36,113
If anything happens to Neha...

560
01:08:40,747 --> 01:08:43,046
Your anger is justified

561
01:08:43,747 --> 01:08:46,380
You sure are obsessed
with your love

562
01:08:47,279 --> 01:08:50,046
But isn't right to lose control
of yourself at a time like this

563
01:08:51,212 --> 01:08:56,377
Listen to me with a calm mind.
We don't intend to kill Neha right now

564
01:08:57,011 --> 01:08:58,979
We'll return her to you safely

565
01:08:59,145 --> 01:09:01,314
But you'll have to do something
for us in return

566
01:09:01,546 --> 01:09:03,712
I will do nothing for you

567
01:09:26,779 --> 01:09:31,078
It's perfectly all right for us to
kill anyone to accomplish our mission

568
01:09:32,113 --> 01:09:35,944
When I gesture again,
Neha could fall off too

569
01:09:42,145 --> 01:09:44,078
This is Anita Chaudhary

570
01:09:44,810 --> 01:09:47,578
She's now in New Zealand, under
your father's security arrangements

571
01:09:49,011 --> 01:09:52,212
You will have to bring her to us.
That's it

572
01:09:52,810 --> 01:09:54,779
We'll let Neha Pandit go

573
01:09:58,246 --> 01:10:03,578
The sooner you accomplish this mission,
the better it will be for Neha Pandit

574
01:10:04,145 --> 01:10:06,778
Because spending
a single day with us...

575
01:10:07,212 --> 01:10:10,145
is like leading a life of
a thousand years of hardships

576
01:10:15,179 --> 01:10:18,810
Here's your new passport with Anita
Chaudhary's. They're in new names

577
01:10:19,511 --> 01:10:22,810
I know you'd want the next meeting
to take place at the earliest

578
01:10:23,243 --> 01:10:25,212
God protect you

579
01:10:58,377 --> 01:11:00,344
Your luggage is...

580
01:11:05,975 --> 01:11:07,944
That's all right.
Here you are

581
01:11:08,444 --> 01:11:10,408
Here it is

582
01:11:14,475 --> 01:11:16,277
You're from India?
- Yes

583
01:12:35,542 --> 01:12:37,841
Anita, get out of that car!

584
01:12:38,573 --> 01:12:41,442
You can't escape.
Step out!

585
01:12:43,076 --> 01:12:46,707
Step out of the car, I say.
Step out

586
01:12:48,073 --> 01:12:50,375
And you... what have
you been up to?

587
01:12:50,573 --> 01:12:52,841
Sorry, sir. I made a mistake

588
01:12:55,140 --> 01:12:58,109
Forgive me, sir.
I did at the lady's orders

589
01:12:58,475 --> 01:13:02,042
You know what you've done, you idiot?
- I'm no idiot, I'm helpless

590
01:13:02,541 --> 01:13:05,675
If I listen to you,
she hits me

591
01:13:06,108 --> 01:13:08,408
You hit me, when I listen to her.
Forgive me, sir

592
01:13:08,707 --> 01:13:11,474
Touch my feet later, you moron!
Tell me where Anita is!

593
01:13:52,238 --> 01:13:54,774
Who are you?
And why did you hold back my car?

594
01:13:55,238 --> 01:13:57,907
How did you get in?
Who let you inside?

595
01:14:19,340 --> 01:14:21,305
Ajay, when did you arrive?

596
01:14:22,171 --> 01:14:23,939
A little while ago, dad

597
01:14:25,171 --> 01:14:27,538
Did you see a girl around?
- Yes

598
01:14:34,604 --> 01:14:36,939
How dare you lock me in the boot?

599
01:14:38,706 --> 01:14:41,139
Uncle, who does he think he is?
In the boot...!

600
01:14:42,840 --> 01:14:44,840
She was running away, father.
I had a tough time...

601
01:14:46,104 --> 01:14:49,872
Who the hell are you to touch me?
You called me mad!

602
01:14:50,305 --> 01:14:53,837
You might wring my neck tomorrow!
- He'll do nothing of the sort...

603
01:14:54,203 --> 01:14:57,506
Go on inside.
- I'll fix you!

604
01:15:01,372 --> 01:15:05,904
Did you say so much to Anita?
- No, father. Not so much

605
01:15:06,305 --> 01:15:08,971
But how do you handle her?
She's absolutely crazy

606
01:15:09,238 --> 01:15:13,639
Never mind. And tell me how you
made this trip her so suddenly

607
01:15:14,238 --> 01:15:17,171
Father, I thought about what
you said after you had left

608
01:15:17,703 --> 01:15:21,005
I decided to forget everything else
and concentrate on my career

609
01:15:21,337 --> 01:15:25,005
So I came here.
- Good! At last!

610
01:15:25,372 --> 01:15:30,805
Mr Kaul... what am I hearing?
Anita tried to run away again?

611
01:15:31,305 --> 01:15:34,203
Yes, but my son Ajay
stopped her at the last minute

612
01:15:35,238 --> 01:15:38,770
Amarjeet Singh, this is my son Ajay.
I told you about him, didn't I?

613
01:15:39,305 --> 01:15:43,203
Ajay, this is Captain Amarjeet Singh.
Chief of our team of commandos

614
01:15:43,505 --> 01:15:45,470
I've met him at the airport, father

615
01:15:47,470 --> 01:15:49,703
He's the one you will work under

616
01:15:50,270 --> 01:15:54,970
Captain, explain his duties to him.
- I will...

617
01:15:55,337 --> 01:15:58,238
but he's had a long journey, sir.
Let him take some rest

618
01:15:59,337 --> 01:16:01,738
Ajay, go and freshen up
and I'll work out...

619
01:16:01,935 --> 01:16:04,636
where and what work I can
give you in my team

620
01:16:06,337 --> 01:16:07,569
Come, son

621
01:16:14,671 --> 01:16:16,037
Baburam!

622
01:16:19,470 --> 01:16:21,237
Baburam!

623
01:16:24,304 --> 01:16:26,237
Coming, madam! At once

624
01:16:26,604 --> 01:16:30,804
This new officer's very strict.
He's worse than the senior Kaul

625
01:16:31,304 --> 01:16:33,935
He's being put on duty
to keep an eye on you

626
01:16:34,368 --> 01:16:37,270
And madam, your tricks aren't
working with the new officer

627
01:16:39,703 --> 01:16:42,136
Who are you working for?
Him, or me?

628
01:16:42,368 --> 01:16:45,002
For you, madam
- So stop praising him!

629
01:16:45,301 --> 01:16:47,868
Who does he think he is?
Has he landed from the skies?

630
01:16:48,103 --> 01:16:52,270
My foot he'll be strict with me!
I won't let him remain here at all!

631
01:16:52,670 --> 01:16:56,270
He has dared to mess with me,
with Anita Chaudhary!

632
01:16:56,670 --> 01:17:00,603
He has no idea what he's in for!

633
01:17:39,703 --> 01:17:43,002
Is that a new design in shirts?
It isn't bad really...

634
01:17:43,435 --> 01:17:46,335
but you'd rather not wear it here.
People will laugh at you

635
01:17:46,734 --> 01:17:48,335
You needn't be very happy

636
01:17:48,469 --> 01:17:51,734
You haven't done much by getting into
my room and tearing up my clothes

637
01:17:52,301 --> 01:17:55,769
Girls are like cats, who go after
the cream on the sly

638
01:17:56,269 --> 01:17:59,135
Really? And you guys
are like owls

639
01:17:59,469 --> 01:18:02,068
You think the world is limited
to what you see in the darkness

640
01:18:02,402 --> 01:18:05,001
But that isn't true.
Nothing much has happened yet

641
01:18:05,402 --> 01:18:07,702
Just wait and see
what's going to happen

642
01:18:08,835 --> 01:18:13,167
I know what's going to happen.
Your pride will be shattered

643
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:17,702
And you will cry on my shoulders.
Forgive me, Ajay you will say

644
01:18:18,402 --> 01:18:22,335
And I'm... so large-hearted,
I will forgive you

645
01:18:22,934 --> 01:18:26,635
Let's see who wins and who bows

646
01:18:27,399 --> 01:18:29,867
You're the one who has
to lose and bow

647
01:18:30,466 --> 01:18:33,033
You're the one who will
run away from the battlefield

648
01:18:36,301 --> 01:18:38,701
But keep the elders
out of this game

649
01:18:39,501 --> 01:18:41,966
Not even the breeze
will get to know of this game

650
01:18:42,434 --> 01:18:44,667
And you will vanish into thin air

651
01:18:44,966 --> 01:18:47,934
Baburam, call Ajay
and Anita for breakfast

652
01:18:48,100 --> 01:18:49,800
I've got to go to the bank

653
01:19:02,434 --> 01:19:05,734
What have you done, Anita?
You've ruined my clothes!

654
01:19:09,466 --> 01:19:13,000
I had kept this skateboard over there!
How did it get under my feet?

655
01:19:13,399 --> 01:19:15,701
Why did you keep
this nuisance in the hall?

656
01:19:15,899 --> 01:19:17,864
It could break someone's limbs

657
01:19:18,466 --> 01:19:22,399
God has given you feet to move about.
Why must you have wheels under it?

658
01:19:23,466 --> 01:19:28,832
Nothing's broken, I must say.
- I'm all right!

659
01:19:29,466 --> 01:19:33,399
But you've ruined my appearance!
I'll have to change again!

660
01:19:34,466 --> 01:19:36,431
I'm already late
for the bank

661
01:19:36,797 --> 01:19:41,832
Father, may I go to the bank?
- That would be all right

662
01:19:42,500 --> 01:19:44,431
I need to withdraw
some money urgently

663
01:19:44,667 --> 01:19:47,797
Give him the cheque!
Silly girl

664
01:19:51,567 --> 01:19:54,033
You're justified in
being happy, Ajay

665
01:19:54,500 --> 01:19:57,666
There is always a lull
before the storm

666
01:20:56,096 --> 01:20:57,930
Anita, what are you up to?

667
01:21:05,729 --> 01:21:10,198
So you've landed in a problem?
I can pull you out of it

668
01:21:10,631 --> 01:21:14,198
But you'll have to do something.
- What?

669
01:21:14,430 --> 01:21:17,131
You'll have to accept defeat
and apologise to me

670
01:21:18,029 --> 01:21:20,497
That's impossible.
- All right then

671
01:21:20,764 --> 01:21:22,331
You can rot there

672
01:21:32,596 --> 01:21:35,229
What's up with Ajay?
He hasn't arrived yet

673
01:21:35,697 --> 01:21:40,564
I think... but that's not possible.
- What are you thinking about anyway?

674
01:21:41,662 --> 01:21:44,229
Maybe Ajay's sitting in a casino

675
01:21:44,729 --> 01:21:48,095
That he's fond of gambling,
you never told me...

676
01:21:48,395 --> 01:21:50,363
No, he has no such vices

677
01:21:50,828 --> 01:21:53,895
I hope you've been giving him
money to meet his expenses?

678
01:21:54,229 --> 01:21:57,162
What?
- At his age...

679
01:21:57,363 --> 01:21:59,595
one feels like going to the
discos and the bars

680
01:21:59,997 --> 01:22:03,395
That he likes his liquor,
you never told me...

681
01:22:03,729 --> 01:22:06,595
What rubbish are you talking?
- No, that's just an idea

682
01:22:06,997 --> 01:22:09,729
Maybe that's not true.
- Whenever you think of something...

683
01:22:09,895 --> 01:22:11,595
it's always rubbish

684
01:22:15,363 --> 01:22:17,328
Police with Ajay?

685
01:22:17,694 --> 01:22:19,962
I didn't imagine anything
so nasty, Uncle!

686
01:22:21,095 --> 01:22:22,395
What happened, Ajay?

687
01:22:22,627 --> 01:22:26,395
Someone called the bank and said that
the cheque I have, is a stolen one

688
01:23:07,862 --> 01:23:11,993
Who could've played this joke on you?
No one even knows you here

689
01:23:20,694 --> 01:23:22,661
Well...? How was it?

690
01:23:54,792 --> 01:23:57,894
Where are you going?
- We're going to Ricky Martin's show

691
01:23:59,725 --> 01:24:03,359
Sorry, I can't allow you to
go out right now

692
01:24:03,725 --> 01:24:07,094
Uncle, we planned it long ago!
All my friends...

693
01:24:07,426 --> 01:24:09,725
You are not going anywhere

694
01:24:11,658 --> 01:24:15,060
If you give me anymore trouble,
I'll have to talk to your daddy

695
01:24:15,760 --> 01:24:17,725
You get that?

696
01:24:23,827 --> 01:24:26,394
Security! They've made
a prisoner out of me!

697
01:24:26,760 --> 01:24:28,725
I can't go out,
I can't meet anyone...

698
01:24:28,926 --> 01:24:32,725
there's no entertainment in my life!
I'm sick of such a life!

699
01:24:42,792 --> 01:24:45,027
You girls appear to be fed up

700
01:24:45,394 --> 01:24:48,158
Uncle has stopped us from
going to a programme

701
01:24:48,457 --> 01:24:50,359
What programme?
- Ricky Martin

702
01:24:53,926 --> 01:24:56,559
Whatever father has done
is in your own interests

703
01:24:56,926 --> 01:25:02,158
Life is precious. But you can have
a song and dance here, if you wish

704
01:25:02,493 --> 01:25:05,292
Here? In this house?
- Why not?

705
01:25:05,658 --> 01:25:07,893
The singer's right here, before you

706
01:25:09,859 --> 01:25:12,091
He's going to sing...?

707
01:25:12,826 --> 01:25:15,759
You don't appear to have anything
to do with dance and music

708
01:25:16,292 --> 01:25:20,591
You appear to be a wise girl too.
But you aren't really

709
01:25:22,292 --> 01:25:24,957
What did you say?
- Instead of getting into a fight...

710
01:25:25,158 --> 01:25:27,792
give me the opportunity
to prove what I've just said

711
01:25:28,158 --> 01:25:31,126
You mean we'll have tolerate
your horrible voice?

712
01:25:33,225 --> 01:25:34,792
Listen...

713
01:25:35,158 --> 01:25:37,792
I can make you dance to my tunes

714
01:25:38,158 --> 01:25:40,457
You won't be able to stop yourself,
even if you wish to

715
01:25:40,823 --> 01:25:43,059
What if that doesn't happen?
- I'll accept defeat...

716
01:25:43,225 --> 01:25:44,126
and return to India.
- Very good!

717
01:25:46,457 --> 01:25:49,059
Girls, he's going to pack his bags!

718
01:26:23,890 --> 01:26:37,225
Beautiful...
you're a beautiful sight

719
01:26:42,957 --> 01:26:47,225
You're a beautiful sight,
O fair one

720
01:26:47,890 --> 01:26:52,256
Come to me... I bring for you
all the love from India

721
01:27:40,221 --> 01:27:44,322
Why must you sulk
and torment my heart?

722
01:27:45,354 --> 01:27:49,287
Where do you go,
leaving me pining?

723
01:27:50,689 --> 01:27:55,256
Meet my gaze, O beautiful one...
keep anger out of this

724
01:28:00,520 --> 01:28:04,689
Your glitter takes away
my life, O pretty one

725
01:28:14,988 --> 01:28:19,287
You're a beautiful sight,
O fair one

726
01:28:19,720 --> 01:28:24,287
You're a beautiful sight,
O fair one

727
01:28:43,255 --> 01:28:47,386
When someone from India
makes a promise...

728
01:28:48,020 --> 01:28:52,453
he doesn't even
fear for his life

729
01:28:53,354 --> 01:28:57,988
Be not so arrogant, O pretty one.
Fear the Lord, O pretty one

730
01:29:03,220 --> 01:29:07,386
Whoever has managed to live
without love anyway?

731
01:29:17,421 --> 01:29:22,354
You're a beautiful sight,
O fair one

732
01:29:22,587 --> 01:29:27,354
You're a beautiful sight,
O fair one

733
01:30:13,118 --> 01:30:15,054
Why did you stop singing?

734
01:30:16,386 --> 01:30:17,752
Sing

735
01:30:18,453 --> 01:30:19,920
Sing, I say!

736
01:30:40,020 --> 01:30:42,252
That wasn't right, Anita.
You can't do a thing like that

737
01:30:43,386 --> 01:30:45,586
He said he'd make you dance
and so he did

738
01:30:45,819 --> 01:30:47,886
But you can't slap someone
like that

739
01:32:20,216 --> 01:32:22,181
Do you forgive me?

740
01:32:23,216 --> 01:32:26,448
Do you forgive me?
- Yes, I do

741
01:32:33,417 --> 01:32:35,350
I accept defeat, Ajay

742
01:32:43,250 --> 01:32:45,216
Here, have a bite

743
01:35:04,880 --> 01:35:08,747
What is the matter? What are you
doing here at this hour?

744
01:35:09,845 --> 01:35:12,613
I thought someone has gone
towards Anita's room

745
01:35:12,880 --> 01:35:15,145
So I...
- It isn't right for you...

746
01:35:15,412 --> 01:35:17,779
to leave your room in
the darkness of the night

747
01:35:18,412 --> 01:35:20,645
The security officer can
even make a mistake

748
01:35:22,546 --> 01:35:27,779
I am responsible for Anita's security
and I'm doing my job pretty well

749
01:35:29,680 --> 01:35:32,145
Please go to bed

750
01:35:53,444 --> 01:35:55,377
Give that photograph to me!

751
01:36:05,078 --> 01:36:06,845
That's my photograph, Anita.
Give it back to me

752
01:36:06,979 --> 01:36:10,412
No, I want to take a look at it.
- I want my photograph back

753
01:36:10,645 --> 01:36:12,279
What's your problem
if I take a look at it?

754
01:36:12,444 --> 01:36:14,412
Let me take a look at it.
- I want my photograph back

755
01:36:14,613 --> 01:36:18,412
No, I want to look at it!
And that's it!

756
01:36:33,545 --> 01:36:35,243
I was afraid...

757
01:36:35,479 --> 01:36:38,444
I thought it was someone
else's photograph

758
01:36:39,645 --> 01:36:42,778
Give my photograph back to me.
- Here you are

759
01:36:48,877 --> 01:36:51,778
Ajay, love is a strange
feeling, isn't it?

760
01:36:52,911 --> 01:36:56,844
Man can do anything for it.
- What can you do for it?

761
01:36:57,310 --> 01:36:58,444
I...?

762
01:37:00,978 --> 01:37:02,444
I...

763
01:37:02,911 --> 01:37:05,211
I can take a jump from here
for you

764
01:37:07,612 --> 01:37:10,478
You're laughing?
You think I'm kidding?

765
01:37:10,975 --> 01:37:13,444
I'll take a jump right now
and show you!

766
01:38:55,608 --> 01:38:57,975
What were you up to?
What...?

767
01:38:58,908 --> 01:39:00,875
I love you

768
01:39:02,274 --> 01:39:04,573
And I can jump a thousand times
for my love, Ajay

769
01:39:16,442 --> 01:39:19,006
We've been looking for you!
Get into the car

770
01:39:41,341 --> 01:39:42,605
You, Mr Chaudhary?

771
01:39:43,841 --> 01:39:47,306
Is all well, Mr Kaul?
- Yes, it is

772
01:39:48,006 --> 01:39:50,640
Mr Chaudhary, this is my son Ajay

773
01:39:52,108 --> 01:39:55,306
You've landed suddenly
with such a huge entourage

774
01:39:55,672 --> 01:39:57,640
Is everything all right?

775
01:39:58,672 --> 01:40:01,439
This is my friend, Balwant Gargi.
He lives in America

776
01:40:01,739 --> 01:40:05,306
This is his son, Manish.
My future son-in-law

777
01:40:07,840 --> 01:40:10,805
So Anita's getting married?
Congratulations, Mr Chaudhary

778
01:40:11,073 --> 01:40:14,907
Yes, I'm getting Anita married. Which
is why I've brought these folks here

779
01:40:15,640 --> 01:40:17,605
They're getting engaged tomorrow
and married the day after...

780
01:40:17,805 --> 01:40:21,073
so make some arrangements, please.
- Certainly! Please come

781
01:40:28,605 --> 01:40:31,105
Daddy, you didn't even ask me
before taking such a big decision!

782
01:40:31,439 --> 01:40:34,872
I'm doing what is best for you
under the circumstances, Anita

783
01:40:35,907 --> 01:40:39,006
I want to rid you of the shadow
of death forever and forever

784
01:40:39,305 --> 01:40:41,671
But I can't marry him...
- I will listen to nothing

785
01:40:42,706 --> 01:40:45,671
I am not changing my decision.
And that's it

786
01:41:40,939 --> 01:41:43,738
That's enough, Ajay!
Your run ends here

787
01:41:44,037 --> 01:41:45,738
Come here, Anita

788
01:41:46,238 --> 01:41:48,037
Your conspiracy will
not succeed, Ajay

789
01:41:48,238 --> 01:41:51,104
Come to me, Anita.
He's a very dangerous man...

790
01:41:54,970 --> 01:41:58,072
Anita, you don't know him!
He's a very dangerous man

791
01:41:58,470 --> 01:42:00,438
Come to me!

792
01:42:01,904 --> 01:42:03,404
Hurry up!

793
01:42:27,171 --> 01:42:29,470
You've found a nice
son-in-law, Mr Chaudhary

794
01:42:29,904 --> 01:42:32,970
Our Anita's stands out
in a million too, Ratilal

795
01:44:12,600 --> 01:44:14,103
Stop there, Ajay!

796
01:44:14,935 --> 01:44:17,702
Stop there!
Else, I'll shoot!

797
01:44:31,935 --> 01:44:34,902
Move aside, Anita!
Move aside!

798
01:44:43,966 --> 01:44:48,202
Don't be crazy, Anita!
Move aside!

799
01:47:16,631 --> 01:47:19,064
Sir! The lady's not in her room!

800
01:47:34,131 --> 01:47:36,863
I want to know where
Amarjeet and Ajay are

801
01:47:38,198 --> 01:47:41,564
Mr Chaudhary, Anita has done things
like this even in the past

802
01:47:42,064 --> 01:47:45,064
We've alerted the police and all
airports with their photographs

803
01:47:45,363 --> 01:47:47,863
They'll let us know the moment
they have some information

804
01:48:58,194 --> 01:49:01,162
What happened, Amarjeet?
- Anita has run away, sir

805
01:49:01,529 --> 01:49:03,496
What?
- That's true

806
01:49:04,630 --> 01:49:06,828
And Ajay is the one
who has run way with her

807
01:49:07,363 --> 01:49:11,296
What rubbish! How can he do
something so cheap?

808
01:49:11,627 --> 01:49:13,462
It's true, Mr Kaul

809
01:49:13,694 --> 01:49:16,627
Ajay came here only with the
intention of running away with Anita

810
01:49:17,563 --> 01:49:21,194
When he ran into her at the airport,
Anita's picture fell out of his bag

811
01:49:21,496 --> 01:49:23,729
Why didn't you tell me then?

812
01:49:24,229 --> 01:49:26,863
I thought...
- What did you think about?

813
01:49:27,496 --> 01:49:30,194
Do you think I value Ajay
more than my duties?

814
01:49:36,560 --> 01:49:38,729
Do not worry, Mr Chaudhary

815
01:49:39,228 --> 01:49:42,194
I will return your daughter
to you safely

816
01:49:44,328 --> 01:49:45,627
I will forget that Ajay is my son.
Even if I have to shoot at him...

817
01:49:49,662 --> 01:49:51,895
my hands will not hesitate

818
01:50:25,328 --> 01:50:29,060
A companion I sought...

819
01:50:29,694 --> 01:50:32,859
a companion I have found

820
01:50:34,359 --> 01:50:38,528
I tried to stop my heart...

821
01:50:39,359 --> 01:50:42,527
but I lost my heart

822
01:50:44,292 --> 01:50:48,694
Thanks a million, Lord,
for this happiness

823
01:50:49,158 --> 01:50:53,260
What else do I need in life?

824
01:50:53,661 --> 01:50:57,292
A companion I sought...

825
01:50:58,327 --> 01:51:01,694
a companion I have found

826
01:51:31,893 --> 01:51:36,326
I didn't imagine
I'd fall in love...

827
01:51:36,725 --> 01:51:40,826
that I'd lose my peace
like this

828
01:51:55,559 --> 01:51:59,957
The moment I saw you,
my heart started pounding...

829
01:52:00,390 --> 01:52:04,693
it went crazy with desire

830
01:52:05,292 --> 01:52:09,626
You are the one
I have chosen...

831
01:52:09,858 --> 01:52:12,759
for romance

832
01:52:14,725 --> 01:52:19,024
Thanks a million, Lord,
for this happiness

833
01:52:19,390 --> 01:52:23,559
What else do I need in life?

834
01:52:24,390 --> 01:52:28,692
A companion I sought...

835
01:52:29,158 --> 01:52:32,390
a companion I have found

836
01:52:47,890 --> 01:52:52,158
On every breath of mine,
is etched your name...

837
01:52:52,524 --> 01:52:56,957
in my heart-beat
is your love

838
01:53:11,591 --> 01:53:16,055
These moments that I spend
in your arms...

839
01:53:16,457 --> 01:53:20,756
spread into eons for me

840
01:53:21,457 --> 01:53:25,788
I've fallen in love...

841
01:53:26,157 --> 01:53:29,122
to make my life

842
01:53:30,788 --> 01:53:35,090
Thanks a million, Lord,
for this happiness

843
01:53:35,555 --> 01:53:39,788
What else do I need in life?

844
01:53:40,489 --> 01:53:44,921
A companion I sought...

845
01:53:45,390 --> 01:53:48,788
a companion I have found

846
01:53:57,555 --> 01:54:02,122
I'm going mad with happiness!
I'm flying, Ajay

847
01:54:02,488 --> 01:54:04,823
Don't ever let me fall!

848
01:54:05,488 --> 01:54:07,457
Take care of me, Ajay!

849
01:54:13,055 --> 01:54:16,456
I knew you wouldn't
let me fall, Ajay

850
01:54:31,287 --> 01:54:33,256
Thanks, Ajay Kaul

851
01:54:35,523 --> 01:54:37,488
Ajay, who are they?

852
01:54:38,720 --> 01:54:42,488
You've done a great job for us.
God willing...

853
01:54:42,822 --> 01:54:46,189
Freedom is now ours!
- Freedom?

854
01:54:47,087 --> 01:54:51,921
What freedom is he talking about?
And what job have you done for him?

855
01:54:54,555 --> 01:54:58,921
I'm asking you a question, Ajay.
Say something!

856
01:55:00,389 --> 01:55:01,886
I'll explain

857
01:55:02,555 --> 01:55:04,854
We had a deal with him

858
01:55:05,555 --> 01:55:08,189
The girl he loves
is in our custody

859
01:55:09,621 --> 01:55:12,854
To have her released,
he had to deliver you to us

860
01:55:26,854 --> 01:55:29,886
You... you love someone else?

861
01:55:34,685 --> 01:55:36,988
Why did you deceive me like this?

862
01:55:39,255 --> 01:55:41,554
I had taken you as
the love of my life

863
01:55:42,854 --> 01:55:48,319
And you, you kept pretending
to be in love with me?

864
01:55:51,618 --> 01:55:54,554
I spurned every relationship
for your sake!

865
01:55:56,020 --> 01:55:58,987
I hurt my father's feelings.
And why...?

866
01:55:59,787 --> 01:56:02,587
Because I had fallen
in love with you!

867
01:56:03,618 --> 01:56:06,987
My love was true!
And you...?

868
01:56:07,618 --> 01:56:11,551
Why did you do this to me?
Why?

869
01:56:12,618 --> 01:56:13,920
Why!

870
01:56:18,618 --> 01:56:20,154
Where's Neha?

871
01:56:21,987 --> 01:56:23,551
There's Neha

872
01:56:58,786 --> 01:57:00,984
Drop your guns

873
01:57:25,850 --> 01:57:31,252
Junaid, you think you will
succeed in your designs?

874
01:57:33,319 --> 01:57:34,685
Never

875
01:57:35,319 --> 01:57:39,152
Neha was outside my reach then.
Or else, this game...

876
01:57:58,751 --> 01:58:01,350
For the militants
and the cause...

877
01:58:02,185 --> 01:58:05,984
I was working towards the fulfillment
of my husband Naved Rabbani's mission

878
01:58:48,051 --> 01:58:51,750
I'm Krishnakant,
alias Captain Rashid

879
01:58:54,582 --> 01:58:56,050
Congratulations, Junaid

880
01:58:57,783 --> 01:59:01,483
The first step towards the success
of our mission has been right

881
01:59:01,850 --> 01:59:06,015
You're right, Captain.
Naved will soon return to our fold

882
01:59:06,381 --> 01:59:08,350
And India will be defeated

883
01:59:08,750 --> 01:59:12,416
Javed, throw him over the cliff.
If he survives...

884
01:59:12,817 --> 01:59:15,750
the police of India will kill him.
C'mon!

885
01:59:41,448 --> 01:59:43,381
The latest news!

886
01:59:43,849 --> 01:59:47,783
Home Minister Bhagwat Chaudhari's
daughter has been kidnapped!

887
01:59:48,250 --> 01:59:49,480
Two rupees

888
01:59:50,314 --> 01:59:53,283
Ajay Kaul entrusts her
to the terrorists

889
01:59:53,649 --> 01:59:56,114
Hit them!

890
01:59:56,849 --> 01:59:59,814
You work for the terrorists!
Bloody traitors!

891
02:00:00,047 --> 02:00:01,346
Lynch them!

892
02:00:01,849 --> 02:00:03,814
What are you doing?

893
02:00:11,515 --> 02:00:14,814
What's happening here...?
What are you guys doing?

894
02:00:15,881 --> 02:00:17,546
Out of my way!

895
02:00:19,948 --> 02:00:22,849
What happened, Sudha?
- They've been pelting stones...

896
02:00:23,279 --> 02:00:25,448
and they're calling us traitors

897
02:00:27,881 --> 02:00:30,846
Now hurl the stones!
I'm standing right here

898
02:00:31,881 --> 02:00:33,846
Let me see who's the brave man!

899
02:00:34,680 --> 02:00:36,648
We are not traitors

900
02:00:37,215 --> 02:00:40,980
For the last 40 years, I have been
serving the nation with all sincerity

901
02:00:41,881 --> 02:00:45,346
I have even defied death in
the discharge of my duties

902
02:00:45,881 --> 02:00:47,846
For you people!

903
02:00:49,180 --> 02:00:52,546
What my son has done
has hurt us immensely too

904
02:00:53,913 --> 02:00:55,779
He has given us a lot of pain

905
02:00:55,948 --> 02:00:59,680
And I've already told you.
He is not my son anymore!

906
02:01:00,148 --> 02:01:02,113
He's a traitor of the nation!

907
02:01:03,381 --> 02:01:04,779
He will face the consequences
a traitor of the country must face

908
02:01:07,447 --> 02:01:10,514
I will kill him and hang
his body in the market place

909
02:01:21,546 --> 02:01:24,279
Comb the entire forest!
Find Ajay!

910
02:02:38,011 --> 02:02:41,310
Spread out in all directions.
He mustn't slip out of our hands!

911
02:02:54,011 --> 02:02:56,243
There he is!
Ajay, stop there!

912
02:02:58,176 --> 02:03:00,444
Ajay, stop there!
Stop there!

913
02:03:09,145 --> 02:03:10,612
Stop, Ajay!

914
02:04:20,377 --> 02:04:22,609
Look where he has gone!

915
02:04:51,810 --> 02:04:54,109
Where the hell
has he gone?

916
02:04:59,609 --> 02:05:01,376
Welcome to Zee News

917
02:05:01,810 --> 02:05:07,274
There is not much happening on the
release of Anita Chaudhary

918
02:05:08,140 --> 02:05:12,073
Anita Chaudhary has been abducted
by a terrorist outfit, the Wafai Al Haq

919
02:05:12,943 --> 02:05:16,609
Sources reveal that the journalist
Alok Das will play an important role...

920
02:05:16,841 --> 02:05:19,274
as mediator between the
government and the terrorists

921
02:05:19,609 --> 02:05:22,309
Where and when the talks between the
government and the terrorists...

922
02:05:22,509 --> 02:05:23,943
will take place, has been
kept a closely guarded secret

923
02:05:43,442 --> 02:05:44,908
Hello, Rashid saheb

924
02:05:53,742 --> 02:05:54,675
This way, please

925
02:06:03,207 --> 02:06:05,675
Please be seated, Rashid saheb

926
02:06:09,140 --> 02:06:12,506
Mr Chaudhary, may we begin...?
- I came here at Alok Das's request

927
02:06:13,207 --> 02:06:15,739
Else, we have other ways of
putting forth our demands

928
02:06:16,806 --> 02:06:19,774
The release of our militant
Javed Rabbani

929
02:06:20,207 --> 02:06:22,974
500 million rupees in cash, the
transfer of the Governor of Kashmir...

930
02:06:23,239 --> 02:06:25,806
and the cancellation of
elections in Kashmir

931
02:06:26,239 --> 02:06:28,939
The elections will not be called off

932
02:06:29,506 --> 02:06:31,806
Nor will you succeed
in your evil designs

933
02:06:33,239 --> 02:06:36,774
This game of terror and guns
will end with your death, Rashid

934
02:06:38,140 --> 02:06:39,774
You will not have Kashmir. Never

935
02:06:41,707 --> 02:06:46,573
Earlier, you only asked for
the release of Naved Rabbani

936
02:06:47,305 --> 02:06:51,207
Your new demands...
- The girl we hold a gun to...

937
02:06:51,605 --> 02:06:54,171
is not the daughter of a peon
in a government school

938
02:06:54,774 --> 02:06:57,207
She's the daughter of the
Home Minister of India

939
02:06:57,805 --> 02:07:01,207
We know what her head is worth.
- What will you do to her?

940
02:07:02,273 --> 02:07:05,238
Kill her? Go ahead. Kill her

941
02:07:05,672 --> 02:07:08,038
But the government of India
will not bow to you

942
02:07:08,273 --> 02:07:11,904
Nor will your demands be accepted.
- The government will bow and break!

943
02:07:12,273 --> 02:07:14,238
We have played
these games earlier

944
02:07:14,439 --> 02:07:16,904
We have defeated the Indian
government on earlier occasions

945
02:07:17,273 --> 02:07:19,506
You have 48 hours.
In case you refuse...

946
02:07:19,671 --> 02:07:22,206
let us know where we must
send your daughter's body

947
02:07:22,471 --> 02:07:24,605
Rashid saheb...
at least listen to me!

948
02:08:14,337 --> 02:08:18,037
The negotiations between the
government and the terrorist outfit...

949
02:08:18,337 --> 02:08:21,537
the Wafai Al Haq,
is finally taking shape

950
02:08:21,805 --> 02:08:24,738
The government has accepted
the demands of the outfit

951
02:08:25,337 --> 02:08:29,738
It has agreed to release the
dreaded terrorist, Naved Rabbani

952
02:08:30,337 --> 02:08:33,970
While the common man is jolted
at the government's decision...

953
02:08:34,438 --> 02:08:37,337
even opposition political parties
have expressed their reservations

954
02:08:37,703 --> 02:08:40,270
They believe that the government
is doing an irreparable harm...

955
02:08:40,703 --> 02:08:45,002
to the country by releasing Naved.
That this decision by the government...

956
02:08:45,305 --> 02:08:51,136
could further encourage the terrorists
to step up their activities in the nation

957
02:09:09,337 --> 02:09:11,304
You have taken the wrong
decision, Mr Chaudhary!

958
02:09:11,738 --> 02:09:14,104
How can you release such
a dangerous terrorist?

959
02:09:22,435 --> 02:09:24,935
The government's decision has
cast a slur on our party

960
02:09:34,604 --> 02:09:37,069
You have hurt the people
of the country, Mr Chaudhary

961
02:09:43,435 --> 02:09:44,935
Sign here

962
02:09:54,435 --> 02:09:58,036
To save one life, we have played
with our security arrangements

963
02:09:58,502 --> 02:10:01,203
For your daughter's love, you
give up your duty and responsibility?

964
02:10:01,734 --> 02:10:04,203
We didn't expect this
from you, Mr Chaudhary

965
02:10:04,702 --> 02:10:07,734
Right now, I cannot answer
any of your questions

966
02:10:16,470 --> 02:10:18,403
Sir, as far as I know you...

967
02:10:18,702 --> 02:10:21,435
I can't believe it either
that you are doing this

968
02:10:21,868 --> 02:10:25,403
No, Amarjeet Singh. I have taken
this decision after due thought

969
02:10:27,469 --> 02:10:30,435
It's a move I cannot reveal to them

970
02:10:31,469 --> 02:10:35,769
Till now, the terrorists opened
fire on us and went into hiding

971
02:10:37,167 --> 02:10:41,435
I want them to come under the firing
range of our soldiers at least once

972
02:10:42,269 --> 02:10:44,234
They will get death,
not Naved

973
02:10:44,868 --> 02:10:48,402
I have issued instructions
to the police and the army

974
02:10:50,502 --> 02:10:54,301
If a bullet has to find
my daughter's body, it will

975
02:10:55,636 --> 02:10:58,167
Till now my daughter's life
was in danger

976
02:10:59,167 --> 02:11:01,068
I am now betting on it

977
02:11:15,435 --> 02:11:17,268
Open the door

978
02:11:18,768 --> 02:11:20,734
Get in

979
02:11:24,966 --> 02:11:26,435
Move it!

980
02:11:41,268 --> 02:11:42,501
Hurry up

981
02:11:45,533 --> 02:11:46,832
Let's go

982
02:12:04,698 --> 02:12:07,533
The army entourage with Naved
has just left the camp

983
02:12:20,631 --> 02:12:23,167
It's crossing the bridge

984
02:13:12,099 --> 02:13:12,997
Stop it!

985
02:13:55,662 --> 02:13:57,631
Where are you taking me?

986
02:14:13,430 --> 02:14:15,163
Where has he taken Naved?

987
02:14:18,697 --> 02:14:21,229
Ajay Kaul has run away
with Naved!

988
02:14:38,764 --> 02:14:40,462
What are you doing?

989
02:14:41,630 --> 02:14:44,363
Leave her alone!
- I'm going to kill her!

990
02:14:44,729 --> 02:14:47,296
They'll kill Naved...?
As if I'll spare her!

991
02:14:47,997 --> 02:14:50,697
Come to your senses!
Calm down!

992
02:14:51,130 --> 02:14:53,662
Naved isn't just your husband,
he's also our chief!

993
02:14:54,331 --> 02:14:56,697
And we can't bargain with
our chief's death!

994
02:14:57,029 --> 02:15:01,462
You ought to know! For his life,
it's necessary that she lives!

995
02:15:01,729 --> 02:15:04,694
He's right, Nusrat.
It's time to use your brains

996
02:15:04,997 --> 02:15:06,895
We must find out
what he wants

997
02:15:18,197 --> 02:15:20,529
Where is Captain Rashid?

998
02:15:21,761 --> 02:15:23,694
Hit me as much as you want to

999
02:15:24,029 --> 02:15:28,029
The girl's dying, no doubt.
And you're dying with her too

1000
02:15:30,529 --> 02:15:33,029
I don't know what
your son's problem is!

1001
02:15:33,560 --> 02:15:36,395
We had made all arrangements
to teach the terrorists a lesson!

1002
02:15:36,761 --> 02:15:38,729
But he has ruined it all
by abducting Naved!

1003
02:15:38,895 --> 02:15:42,296
He has saved your daughter's life
by abducting Naved, Mr Chaudhary

1004
02:15:42,761 --> 02:15:45,063
I didn't approve of your plan anyway

1005
02:15:45,429 --> 02:15:49,127
Do you think he's going to embrace
Naved and turn friends with him?

1006
02:15:49,796 --> 02:15:51,296
No, Mr Chaudhary

1007
02:15:51,560 --> 02:15:55,761
I now think Ajay is trying to
correct a wrong he has committed

1008
02:15:56,194 --> 02:15:59,095
And I'm sure, he will
set it right too

1009
02:16:00,229 --> 02:16:02,426
You know what you're doing, Ajay?

1010
02:16:02,795 --> 02:16:05,560
You have provoked them even more
with Naved's abduction

1011
02:16:06,127 --> 02:16:08,296
The danger to Anita's life
has increased

1012
02:16:08,795 --> 02:16:11,395
They could...
- Anita will not even suffer a scratch

1013
02:16:11,795 --> 02:16:14,560
They know, I have Naved
by the throat

1014
02:16:14,993 --> 02:16:18,426
What are you getting at?
- Because of one mistake...

1015
02:16:18,728 --> 02:16:22,162
I've lost everything I had.
I have been branded a traitor

1016
02:16:22,560 --> 02:16:26,127
Because of me, my father has had
to hang his head in shame

1017
02:16:27,162 --> 02:16:29,993
If Naved goes back to them,
it'll all be over

1018
02:16:30,828 --> 02:16:32,795
What do you want me to do?

1019
02:16:32,994 --> 02:16:35,795
I want you to take
my message to them

1020
02:16:36,162 --> 02:16:38,795
I don't know their whereabouts, Ajay

1021
02:16:39,559 --> 02:16:42,193
But I have a way of
sending the message to them

1022
02:16:45,227 --> 02:16:47,292
Greetings.
- Greetings

1023
02:16:47,826 --> 02:16:51,193
There's a message for Mr Rashid.
Please take this letter to him

1024
02:16:52,826 --> 02:16:55,792
Your man is alive and kicking

1025
02:16:57,128 --> 02:17:00,826
I have abducted him because I wanted
to correct a mistake I made

1026
02:17:01,959 --> 02:17:06,459
Bring the girl to Sarafa Bazaar,
hand her over to me...

1027
02:17:06,926 --> 02:17:12,192
and I'll hand your man to you.
At 7 this evening - Ajay Kaul

1028
02:18:07,959 --> 02:18:10,893
The meeting has been cancelled.
I'll return your man to you tomorrow

1029
02:18:11,158 --> 02:18:13,259
11 O clock,
at the potato market

1030
02:19:10,992 --> 02:19:13,924
Tea for you from the Sarafa Bazaar

1031
02:19:17,992 --> 02:19:20,290
Telephone me at this number

1032
02:19:21,324 --> 02:19:22,625
Stay here

1033
02:19:23,324 --> 02:19:26,290
Is there a telephone around?
- Near the temple close by

1034
02:21:18,388 --> 02:21:22,322
They have given us 24 hours, Ajay.
If you don't return their man to them...

1035
02:21:22,789 --> 02:21:25,587
it'll be a bus full of children
that will be blown up...

1036
02:21:25,789 --> 02:21:27,720
not an empty one!
- All right

1037
02:21:29,021 --> 02:21:31,353
I'll return their man to them
in 24 hours

1038
02:21:31,789 --> 02:21:35,220
But tell them to bring
Anita Chaudhary along

1039
02:22:51,452 --> 02:22:54,420
We have succeeded, Naved!
We have succeeded

1040
02:23:04,120 --> 02:23:05,787
Give that to me.
I'll unlock it

1041
02:23:07,420 --> 02:23:09,451
He has betrayed us!

1042
02:23:11,451 --> 02:23:12,352
Hurry up!

1043
02:23:15,218 --> 02:23:17,184
The train is about to start!

1044
02:23:17,685 --> 02:23:19,153
Hurry up!

1045
02:23:25,986 --> 02:23:28,184
Get a hold on yourself...
I'll do something!

1046
02:23:44,753 --> 02:23:46,184
Set him free!

1047
02:24:10,352 --> 02:24:15,252
Get the jeeps! Move it, everybody!
We've got to stop the train!

1048
02:24:20,550 --> 02:24:22,450
Shoot at the handcuff!

1049
02:24:24,352 --> 02:24:25,316
Shoot!

1050
02:24:32,984 --> 02:24:35,251
I don't want to listen
or say anything!

1051
02:24:35,683 --> 02:24:38,584
I don't need your help
and support anymore!

1052
02:24:40,283 --> 02:24:43,251
So you don't love me?

1053
02:24:55,316 --> 02:25:00,950
If my life were at risk and someone
asked you to do something to save it...

1054
02:25:01,316 --> 02:25:03,683
what would you have done?

1055
02:25:04,149 --> 02:25:06,618
You'd have done what I did

1056
02:25:08,816 --> 02:25:12,618
Anita, this train mustn't stop
till I want it to

1057
02:25:29,549 --> 02:25:30,617
Hurry up!

1058
02:26:07,849 --> 02:26:09,147
Don't move!

1059
02:26:09,381 --> 02:26:12,349
Don't stop the train
till I ask you to!

1060
02:26:14,980 --> 02:26:16,114
Faster!

1061
02:26:30,281 --> 02:26:31,349
Nusrat!

1062
02:26:45,415 --> 02:26:47,380
Keep hanging in there!

1063
02:27:07,113 --> 02:27:11,048
Don't fire at the train, Junaid!
It'll jump off the track!

1064
02:27:31,745 --> 02:27:33,212
Don't fire, Junaid!

1065
02:27:54,548 --> 02:27:58,914
Go over to that side.
Let's try and stop the train!

1066
02:28:04,078 --> 02:28:05,212
Faster!

1067
02:28:10,013 --> 02:28:11,280
Junaid!

1068
02:28:56,478 --> 02:28:58,179
Move it! Get closer!

1069
02:29:14,576 --> 02:29:16,879
Fire at the handcuff!

1070
02:29:24,676 --> 02:29:30,179
Come to me!
My brave lions!

1071
02:29:48,611 --> 02:29:50,542
Watch it brother!
I'll come now!

1072
02:30:52,843 --> 02:30:53,908
Closer!

1073
02:31:03,674 --> 02:31:04,774
Bravo!

1074
02:31:05,175 --> 02:31:07,441
We don't have the key!
We'll have the break it!

1075
02:31:07,674 --> 02:31:10,643
Give me your hand!
- Set me free

1076
02:32:04,907 --> 02:32:07,209
Junaid!
- Go and set your husband free!

1077
02:34:16,971 --> 02:34:18,906
Are you all right, dear?
- Yes

1078
02:34:19,871 --> 02:34:21,572
Where's Ajay?

1079
02:34:43,072 --> 02:34:45,004
Forgive me, father

1080
02:34:46,072 --> 02:34:48,870
You have been put to so much
of hardship because of me...

1081
02:34:50,172 --> 02:34:54,103
I've got to know
what you have gone through

1082
02:34:55,603 --> 02:34:58,236
Do you know why made
this mistake?

1083
02:34:58,905 --> 02:35:01,370
Because you had to fight this battle

1084
02:35:02,638 --> 02:35:07,569
Had you lost, I'd have
hung my head in shame

1085
02:35:08,905 --> 02:35:12,836
But I was sure you were the one
who would emerge victorious

1086
02:35:26,938 --> 02:35:30,870
Ajay, I can still take a
jump for you from anywhere

1087
02:35:37,138 --> 02:35:41,569
A companion, I sought...

1088
02:35:42,004 --> 02:35:44,904
a companion I have found

1089
02:35:46,671 --> 02:35:50,904
I tried to stop my heart...

1090
02:35:51,404 --> 02:35:54,335
but I've lost it

1091
02:35:56,069 --> 02:36:00,504
Thanks a million
for this happiness, Lord

1092
02:36:00,969 --> 02:36:05,270
What else could I ask for
in life?

1093
02:36:05,702 --> 02:36:09,935
A companion, I sought...

1094
02:36:10,435 --> 02:36:13,904
a companion I have found
