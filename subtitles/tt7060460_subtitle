00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,375


3
00:02:05,417 --> 00:02:08,000
DGP. Ashok Rajan has
issued an order.

4
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,375
Will discard the
unnecessary files,

5
00:02:10,375 --> 00:02:13,250
post which will scan all
the important files,

6
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:14,875
which will be guarded
with safety.

7
00:02:14,917 --> 00:02:16,375
If it's a small case,
then it's 3 years.

8
00:02:16,417 --> 00:02:18,042
If it's a big case,
then 8 years.

9
00:02:18,125 --> 00:02:20,333
Feed only the cases dated
during that period.

10
00:02:20,333 --> 00:02:21,958
Scrap rest of the files.

11
00:02:28,042 --> 00:02:29,458
This file is to be scrapped.

12
00:02:29,458 --> 00:02:30,167
Put it there Sir.

13
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,458
Quickly grab them.

14
00:02:35,667 --> 00:02:36,333
Sasi!

15
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:37,583
This has to be fed
in to the computer.

16
00:03:17,792 --> 00:03:18,625
Constable!

17
00:03:18,708 --> 00:03:20,333
Where can I get Theeran
Sir's phone number?

18
00:03:24,917 --> 00:03:25,833
It's DSP Theeran.

19
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:26,833
Good Morning Sir.

20
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:29,167
Sir, this is SI Sasi from SARP.

21
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:32,167
I just read your case file on
Inter-State investigation.

22
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:33,625
I couldn't believe it.

23
00:03:33,667 --> 00:03:36,167
The case which turned
my life upside down,

24
00:03:36,917 --> 00:03:38,750
the case which I wish
to forget all together,

25
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,625
but this phone call,

26
00:03:40,958 --> 00:03:42,500
has reminded of
all those things.

27
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,042
My entire life...

28
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:46,625
...just flashed for a moment.

29
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,250
Who's that?

30
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:55,333
Grandma!

31
00:04:57,042 --> 00:04:58,167
Dad!

32
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:06,125
Oh No!

33
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:17,333
No...let me go!

34
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:52,458
Susi!

35
00:06:02,042 --> 00:06:03,625
Please let me go.

36
00:06:04,208 --> 00:06:05,250
If you commit this crime,

37
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:06,917
do you think the Police
will let you go?

38
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:10,333
Why don't you be smart
and think about it?

39
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:12,833
I don't like to
be the smart one.

40
00:06:12,917 --> 00:06:14,042
Ask me why?

41
00:06:14,042 --> 00:06:14,917
Why?

42
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,958
A human's smartness,

43
00:06:17,042 --> 00:06:18,625
has fooled many.

44
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,250
Have made them slaves.

45
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:22,708
Have destroyed many communities.

46
00:06:22,917 --> 00:06:24,667
It has also turned
me in to a thief.

47
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:27,625
That's why I never like
to be the smart one.

48
00:06:41,208 --> 00:06:42,333
Walking Begin!

49
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:43,250
Left-Right!

50
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:44,167
Left-Right!

51
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:45,125
Left-Right!

52
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:46,250
Left-Right!

53
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:47,250
Left-Right!

54
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,250
Running Change!

55
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:49,667
CADETS!

56
00:06:49,708 --> 00:06:50,875
During the DSP training,

57
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:52,792
there's work out 6
table card method.

58
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:56,833
Every table card, has an exercise which
will strengthen every muscle in your body.

59
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:03,375
"Pain fuels the wound inflicted"

60
00:07:03,417 --> 00:07:07,333
"There goes the Achiever,
There goes the Achiever"

61
00:07:07,417 --> 00:07:10,875
"Turn to the left...Turn left!"

62
00:07:10,917 --> 00:07:14,917
"Turn to the right...Turn Right"

63
00:07:15,667 --> 00:07:17,250
What's the duty of a Policemen?

64
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:18,458
Prevention and
Detection of Crime,

65
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,417
Collection of Intelligence,

66
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:20,708
and maintenance of Law & Order.

67
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:21,167
Good!

68
00:07:21,167 --> 00:07:23,417
It's easy get hold
of the criminals.

69
00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:25,250
But getting them
convicted is tough.

70
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:27,792
That's why, when you're at the
Crime Scene for the first time,

71
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:29,417
should observe keenly.

72
00:07:29,542 --> 00:07:31,500
'Cause you won't get
that opportunity again.

73
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:34,750
Observation, Detection and Analysis
skills are very important to us.

74
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:36,542
Use your eyes the most,

75
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:37,875
hands the least,

76
00:07:37,917 --> 00:07:39,708
especially your
mouth the least-est.

77
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:51,250
"When it's beyond you, the
heart might get poisoned"

78
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:54,792
"Police Department would
end up healing that wound"

79
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:57,625
"The blood lost on this soil..."

80
00:07:57,667 --> 00:07:58,333
CADETS!

81
00:07:58,792 --> 00:07:59,750
Attention!

82
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,083
Knife is of the accused
from the Crime Scene.

83
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:02,958
How will you take it?

84
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:07,042
Where did you learn that?

85
00:08:07,792 --> 00:08:08,917
Cinema I believe?

86
00:08:08,917 --> 00:08:09,917
Yes Sir!

87
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:12,042
Next.

88
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,625
Why did you do that?

89
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:22,250
Fingerprints are something which
gets imprinted due to sweat.

90
00:08:22,792 --> 00:08:24,250
It'll get wiped off, even if we
pick them up with a handkerchief.

91
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:26,417
Visualize how the Criminal
would've handled it,

92
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,542
and pick it up on the opposite
side with minimum handling.

93
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:29,250
Good.

94
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,333
Clap for him.

95
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:37,583
"Turn to the left...Turn left!"

96
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:41,125
"Turn to the
right...Turn right!"

97
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:45,250
"Turn to the left...Turn left!"

98
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:48,167
"Turn to the
right...Turn right!"

99
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:50,083
Hey buddy! you've
topped the list.

100
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:51,458
-Yayy!
-Be careful guys.

101
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:02,000
After 1 year of training,

102
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:04,000
went home for Diwali.

103
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:15,917
Mom!

104
00:09:16,042 --> 00:09:16,833
Mom!

105
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:18,500
Mom!

106
00:09:18,667 --> 00:09:19,833
Knock harder...

107
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:21,542
...must've sunk in
to the serials.

108
00:09:46,167 --> 00:09:48,500
Twenty Seconds, you've
been staring at my face.

109
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:50,625
Meanwhile I would've
read two questions.

110
00:09:51,042 --> 00:09:51,917
Waste of time.

111
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,500
-You...?
-Theera!

112
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:55,167
Did you just get here?

113
00:09:55,167 --> 00:09:56,417
Come in, Mahesh.

114
00:09:58,458 --> 00:09:59,792
She's our neighbor
Teacher's daughter.

115
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:01,000
-Moved in recently.
-Nothing in there.

116
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,708
Hey!

117
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,375
Hey, did you get my make-up kit?

118
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:04,792
How disrespectful you're.

119
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:05,958
He'll definitely get it for you,

120
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:07,083
let him join the duty.

121
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:09,250
Freshen up, I'll
serve you guys food.

122
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,500
Hey!

123
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:16,250
I thought you were
fit for nothing.

124
00:10:16,667 --> 00:10:18,792
Not bad, the room looks great.

125
00:10:18,792 --> 00:10:20,833
It isn't me, It was
Priya who you just saw.

126
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:21,833
No wonder.

127
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:24,000
She seems like a studious one.

128
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:25,917
She regretted
wasting 20 seconds.

129
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:27,583
Is she pursuing IAS?

130
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:28,625
She's studious.

131
00:10:28,667 --> 00:10:30,542
But her parents are not
letting her study though.

132
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:35,542
Heard that your daughter
is studying at the moment.

133
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:37,792
She can continue her studies
even after the marriage.

134
00:10:37,917 --> 00:10:38,833
I want to study.

135
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:40,000
Please make my
mother understand.

136
00:10:40,042 --> 00:10:42,875
Ok, Ok don't cry...don't cry.

137
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:43,958
I don't want to get married.

138
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:45,375
Please make mother understand.

139
00:10:45,417 --> 00:10:47,250
-Ok, don't cry.
-I want to study...

140
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,833
If you repeat that once
again, I'll thrash you.

141
00:10:49,917 --> 00:10:50,917
Hold on.

142
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:53,917
It's the women, who are
bread winners these days

143
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:54,958
Let her continue studies.

144
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:55,792
You don't get it,

145
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:57,625
It's been ages since she
failed Higher Secondary.

146
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,708
If given any work to do,

147
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:01,042
she pretends to study.

148
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:03,000
But she reads comics
hiding behind the books.

149
00:11:03,042 --> 00:11:04,417
Lazy!

150
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:08,625
Interesting.

151
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:09,375
Then,

152
00:11:09,417 --> 00:11:11,042
does it look like I'm
narrating a story.

153
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:12,792
trying to be sarcastic
with a Policeman?

154
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:13,375
Oh God!

155
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:14,833
-Bloody pig!
-Buffalo.

156
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:29,875
Crook!

157
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:38,958
Hey...hey be careful kids.

158
00:11:39,417 --> 00:11:40,708
Heard that your Son is here.

159
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:00,833
Buddy,

160
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:01,792
the food is delicious.

161
00:12:07,917 --> 00:12:09,083
Did you eat the sweets?

162
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:09,708
Huh?

163
00:12:18,167 --> 00:12:18,917
Hey!

164
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:20,958
Where are you going?

165
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,750
What's it?

166
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:32,042
Nothing,

167
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:34,250
felt that you might
want to talk.

168
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,458
So just came over to...

169
00:12:37,042 --> 00:12:38,167
Shall I call my Dad?

170
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:45,750
-Sweetheart.
-Hmmm.

171
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,458
-Sweetheart.
-Hmmm.

172
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:50,083
Our Neighbor Priya,

173
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:51,792
yeah, what about her?

174
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:52,958
She...

175
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,458
...seems to have fallen
in love with me.

176
00:12:55,542 --> 00:12:56,792
Why are you telling me this?

177
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:57,958
You're not in love
with her right?

178
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:58,750
Ignore then.

179
00:12:58,792 --> 00:13:00,250
I too am in love with her.

180
00:13:01,167 --> 00:13:02,750
You got to help me
with this dear.

181
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:04,958
I'm your sister,

182
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:05,917
not a pimp.

183
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,458
You're crazy to ask
your sister that,

184
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:12,958
there's a society called
friends for this kind of work.

185
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:14,333
Just shut up,

186
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:15,500
don't irritate me.

187
00:13:15,667 --> 00:13:16,542
Look here,

188
00:13:17,042 --> 00:13:18,125
A Friend is,

189
00:13:18,167 --> 00:13:19,833
equal to two elder brothers.

190
00:13:19,917 --> 00:13:21,917
equal to four younger brothers.

191
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:23,375
When it comes to love,

192
00:13:23,417 --> 00:13:25,625
they're equal to 100 brokers.

193
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:26,542
Huh!

194
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,250
She's definitely
in love with me.

195
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:30,667
But she's confusing me,

196
00:13:30,667 --> 00:13:31,875
by not expressing it.

197
00:13:32,042 --> 00:13:34,958
It's possible only in Rajinikanth's
movies for the women to confess love.

198
00:13:35,042 --> 00:13:36,417
That won't happen in reality.

199
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,250
Just follow as I say,

200
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:39,042
tell me.

201
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:40,042
Follow her.

202
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:45,083
Buddy,

203
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:47,250
you're going to be a DSP,

204
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:49,583
do you have any regrets
following a girl?

205
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:50,625
-Nope.
-Good boy.

206
00:13:51,167 --> 00:13:53,083
Even if you happen to
be the Chief Minister,

207
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:55,458
you got to lurk with
no conscience of time,

208
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,667
only then you can impress them.

209
00:13:56,667 --> 00:13:57,667
Ok then, run.

210
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:58,667
Priya.

211
00:13:59,083 --> 00:13:59,708
Priya!

212
00:14:01,167 --> 00:14:03,250
If you keep stalking, I'll
let my Dad know about it.

213
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:05,750
-What did she say?
-She'll complaint to her Dad it seems...

214
00:14:06,667 --> 00:14:08,042
Periyar was spot on,

215
00:14:08,417 --> 00:14:09,542
he was right about it.

216
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:10,958
-How do you say so?
-Of course...

217
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,500
Ma'am has been praying for ages and
still haven't cleared her exams,

218
00:14:13,542 --> 00:14:14,917
that explains, there's no God.

219
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:21,042
Son,

220
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:22,875
no use in just praying hard,

221
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:24,042
got to study hard too.

222
00:14:24,167 --> 00:14:26,458
If I had to get through
only by studying hard...

223
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,167
...then why there's a God?

224
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:42,333
"You've been studying
hard on the terrace,"

225
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:43,500
"that's History..."

226
00:14:43,542 --> 00:14:45,167
...it's not History
but Mathematics.

227
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:46,875
She's been trying to get
through that for years.

228
00:14:48,042 --> 00:14:48,917
So then,

229
00:14:49,167 --> 00:14:51,833
looks like you're all
cozy gawking at her.

230
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:54,167
I recited a beautiful poetry,

231
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:55,625
she doesn't seem to care.

232
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,833
She's playing hard to get.

233
00:14:57,875 --> 00:14:58,875
I'm gonna....

234
00:15:04,167 --> 00:15:05,000
Buffalo!

235
00:15:05,042 --> 00:15:06,708
-Hope you're doing good, Son?
-I'm good Aunty.

236
00:15:08,042 --> 00:15:09,708
When are you joining the duty?

237
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:10,833
Once the field training is done.

238
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:13,500
You took up Group One
and became a Police.

239
00:15:13,792 --> 00:15:15,000
But the one here,

240
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,833
-buffalo! buffalo!
-It hurts!

241
00:15:19,667 --> 00:15:22,542
It'll be embarrassing if a teacher's
daughter flunks the exam.

242
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:24,458
If she doesn't get
through this year,

243
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:27,375
I'll get her married to
some uneducated politician.

244
00:15:27,417 --> 00:15:28,333
Uncle don't act in haste,

245
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:29,625
give me a chance.

246
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:31,125
Son!?

247
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:34,375
I meant, when I'll be
coaching my sister...

248
00:15:34,417 --> 00:15:35,958
...thought will coach Priya too,

249
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:37,958
and help her get
through the exams.

250
00:15:38,542 --> 00:15:41,542
I'm wondering, 'cause
she's quite grown up.

251
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:43,333
Dad, please not him.

252
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:44,250
I'll definitely get through.

253
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:47,333
Please!

254
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:49,583
She got really scared,
'cause you're a Policemen.

255
00:15:49,917 --> 00:15:51,750
You're the right person for her.

256
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:53,042
Dad, please don't.

257
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:54,083
Dad, please don't.

258
00:15:54,167 --> 00:15:56,667
I was smart to trick
your Dad in to it.

259
00:15:57,042 --> 00:15:58,083
Are these your sketches?

260
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,458
You're very creative.

261
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:01,750
Go on...

262
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:04,458
Get coached by Uncle,
and try to be like him.

263
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:05,583
On this page number...

264
00:16:05,792 --> 00:16:07,125
Priya get ready.

265
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:09,375
Shall we test how much
you've learn till now?

266
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:11,583
That's the question paper,

267
00:16:12,167 --> 00:16:13,583
you've ten minutes.

268
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:26,583
"He's been taken to the operation theater"
(Serial on TV)

269
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:39,917
"Operation is going on mother"
(Serial on TV)

270
00:16:45,042 --> 00:16:46,542
Uncle, you're the reason
Priya is flunking.

271
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,250
How will she concentrate on
studies with a loud TV running.

272
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:53,458
I'm really sorry.

273
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:56,792
Sister Chitra!

274
00:16:56,875 --> 00:16:57,875
are you home?

275
00:16:57,875 --> 00:16:59,625
It's time already...

276
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:24,792
Son!

277
00:17:25,958 --> 00:17:27,583
Jon Snow hasn't returned yet,

278
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,000
wonder what happened
with the White Walkers.

279
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:31,708
I can't barge in to
neighbors like my wife did.

280
00:17:34,167 --> 00:17:35,542
Lock the door,

281
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:36,833
and watch with a low volume.

282
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:37,833
Thank you Son.

283
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:41,375
Sweetheart!

284
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:43,167
Damn, what's it?

285
00:17:43,542 --> 00:17:45,083
I'll get you a make-up kit.

286
00:17:45,167 --> 00:17:46,500
Can you get me a cup of tea.

287
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:51,583
Kids!

288
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:53,167
Keep reading with heads down.

289
00:17:53,542 --> 00:17:54,375
Ok!?

290
00:17:54,417 --> 00:17:55,958
Ok uncle!

291
00:17:59,167 --> 00:18:00,250
Problem is fixed.

292
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:01,583
Now we can happily romance.

293
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:02,500
Hopes you got!

294
00:18:02,542 --> 00:18:04,042
Then why did you click
a picture of me?

295
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,250
and why did you wink at me?

296
00:18:06,167 --> 00:18:08,167
Shall I call my Dad?...Shall I!?

297
00:18:17,167 --> 00:18:18,167
Hopeless!

298
00:18:18,583 --> 00:18:20,708
You'll never get through
the exams in this life.

299
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:23,417
Instead confess your love
to me and settle down.

300
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,917
-Daddy!
-What happened dear?

301
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:26,333
This crack head is hitting me.

302
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:27,125
What's it?

303
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:30,083
Do you know what she wrote
for an essay on Meera Bai?

304
00:18:30,167 --> 00:18:31,917
"Meera Bai is a Big Mattress"

305
00:18:31,917 --> 00:18:34,792
"On which 3-4 people can sleep on"

306
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,042
"Meera Bai at our
house has worn off"

307
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:38,667
"We need to get a new one"

308
00:18:39,917 --> 00:18:41,875
I wrote the same thing
during the last exam.

309
00:18:41,917 --> 00:18:43,583
My Dad had evaluated it and
gave two marks for it.

310
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:44,500
Didn't you Dad?

311
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:49,042
Spare the eyes Son.

312
00:18:49,042 --> 00:18:50,625
But skin her thoroughly.

313
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,250
Dad!

314
00:18:52,417 --> 00:18:53,833
Do as he says.

315
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:19,583
Wake up!

316
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:49,333
Acting...Acting...Acting!

317
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:04,208
Hey!

318
00:20:04,792 --> 00:20:05,708
Please.

319
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:06,958
Let me go.

320
00:20:07,667 --> 00:20:10,042
In order to evade
the daily chores,

321
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:12,417
I was pretending to study.

322
00:20:12,583 --> 00:20:14,625
You've been torturing me a lot.

323
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:16,333
Don't you pity this cutie?

324
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,167
Am I not a cute one?

325
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:19,417
Please!?

326
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:21,125
Dear!

327
00:20:21,792 --> 00:20:23,417
I never did ask you to study.

328
00:20:23,667 --> 00:20:24,667
I asked you to love me.

329
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:26,917
"They're in love it seems."

330
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:28,875
Just say "Dear I Love You",

331
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:29,875
I'll let you go.

332
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:30,958
Not a chance, get lost.

333
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:31,958
Get lost!?

334
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:32,875
Damn it!

335
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:35,792
I get really angry if you
knock me on the head.

336
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:36,500
Ok.

337
00:20:36,917 --> 00:20:38,375
You don't have to
say "I Love you".

338
00:20:39,042 --> 00:20:41,333
Give me a kiss, I'll let you go.

339
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,917
First apologize for hitting me.

340
00:20:42,958 --> 00:20:43,958
Close your eyes, I'll apologize.

341
00:20:55,583 --> 00:20:57,333
Is this the way to apologize?

342
00:20:59,167 --> 00:21:01,083
I'll let Dad know about this.

343
00:21:03,917 --> 00:21:06,667
-Shahrukh Khan built the Taj Mahal.
-Yes, Yes.

344
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,458
Mom had asked to pack
your things for training.

345
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:12,375
Don't get too happy.

346
00:21:12,417 --> 00:21:13,375
It's not that far,

347
00:21:13,417 --> 00:21:14,667
I'll be back soon.

348
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:19,042
Are you aware of Field
Training Model?

349
00:21:19,167 --> 00:21:21,167
Have to work as a Para
Constable for a week.

350
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:23,333
Have to gather records on crooks and
in postal department for a week.

351
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,792
Got to work as a Writer and
learn record complaints.

352
00:21:25,958 --> 00:21:28,375
Work as an SI for a month and
learn Station maintenance.

353
00:21:28,667 --> 00:21:31,667
Work as an Inspector and learn
their duties and investigation.

354
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:34,833
And lastly get associated with all
the offices from Traffic to DSP.

355
00:21:43,917 --> 00:21:45,000
Don't you guys understand,

356
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:46,167
College students.

357
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:47,833
-Both died on the spot.
-Give me that torch.

358
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:49,958
"Sir is here."

359
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:50,958
"please be quiet."

360
00:21:50,958 --> 00:21:52,500
"Don't you get it
that Sir is here?"

361
00:21:52,542 --> 00:21:53,417
"Please listen to
what I have to say."

362
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:54,750
"Who the hell is he?
get lost from here."

363
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,167
"Did both die on the spot?"

364
00:21:56,542 --> 00:21:57,250
Sir.

365
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:59,458
These guys didn't switch
on their headlight,

366
00:21:59,458 --> 00:22:00,417
don't lie to me.

367
00:22:02,042 --> 00:22:03,500
They came with
headlight on for sure,

368
00:22:04,125 --> 00:22:06,917
If they'd rammed in when it was on,
the tungsten would've got burnt.

369
00:22:07,083 --> 00:22:08,417
If not would've been intact.

370
00:22:08,417 --> 00:22:09,667
Muthu note this
down on the report.

371
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:11,250
It's an NRI murder case,

372
00:22:11,333 --> 00:22:13,250
the sniffer dog did
go around the house.

373
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:14,542
But couldn't find the dead body.

374
00:22:50,083 --> 00:22:51,750
Sir! ask them to dig here.

375
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:56,958
Good!

376
00:22:57,583 --> 00:22:59,917
Take a class for our
Range this Sunday.

377
00:23:00,333 --> 00:23:01,917
"Locard's Principle of Exchange"

378
00:23:01,917 --> 00:23:04,167
When two particles
collide with each other,

379
00:23:04,167 --> 00:23:07,333
Components of one particle
will transfer in to...

380
00:23:10,708 --> 00:23:13,500
Asking for paper to lodge a complaint
and taking bribe at the beat duty,

381
00:23:13,542 --> 00:23:15,375
is bringing down the respect
our Police Department.

382
00:23:15,417 --> 00:23:17,542
Sir, food for the accused,

383
00:23:17,583 --> 00:23:19,042
station maintenance,

384
00:23:19,083 --> 00:23:22,333
biriyani for the
protestors who we arrest.

385
00:23:22,375 --> 00:23:24,708
These expenses amount to
two to three lacs a year.

386
00:23:24,708 --> 00:23:26,333
If you can find a
solution to that,

387
00:23:26,375 --> 00:23:28,042
we will never take bribe.

388
00:23:28,417 --> 00:23:29,833
Take from the ones who have,

389
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,167
let go of the ones who don't.

390
00:23:32,125 --> 00:23:34,542
Amongst all this you'll have
to keep the Law in Order.

391
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,542
Is it for me?

392
00:23:50,417 --> 00:23:51,417
Thanks!

393
00:23:56,167 --> 00:23:57,167
Sweetheart.

394
00:23:57,833 --> 00:23:59,083
You must be craving
for Tea, aren't you?

395
00:23:59,167 --> 00:24:00,083
Hmmm!

396
00:24:00,167 --> 00:24:01,833
Craving is getting
a bit too much,

397
00:24:01,833 --> 00:24:02,958
you guys are going
to get caught.

398
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Kids!

399
00:24:04,083 --> 00:24:05,333
Sister will find it difficult,

400
00:24:05,375 --> 00:24:06,875
please go and help her.

401
00:24:06,875 --> 00:24:08,958
-It's going to be fun.
-Get in the front.

402
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,458
Enough of pretending to study.

403
00:24:10,792 --> 00:24:12,958
Give a massage, my
body is aching.

404
00:24:13,625 --> 00:24:14,083
I won't.

405
00:24:14,083 --> 00:24:15,958
Shall I tell your Dad about
your love escapades.

406
00:24:16,125 --> 00:24:17,250
-Uncle!
-Hey...Hey!

407
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:18,250
Ssssh!

408
00:24:18,792 --> 00:24:19,917
I'll do it damn it.

409
00:24:23,542 --> 00:24:25,167
Just like that on the back too.

410
00:24:33,958 --> 00:24:35,958
It'll be great if
you can sing too.

411
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:45,792
Hey...hey, don't touch that.

412
00:24:45,875 --> 00:24:47,500
Hey, if you get down,

413
00:24:47,542 --> 00:24:48,542
I'll thrash you.

414
00:24:48,583 --> 00:24:51,500
You're sketching
in a reading book.

415
00:24:51,542 --> 00:24:52,542
Isn't that wrong?

416
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:56,500
Oh, Oh.

417
00:24:56,542 --> 00:24:59,167
Oh, so my pictures I've
been looking for are here.

418
00:25:00,375 --> 00:25:02,708
Police dear is a fool,

419
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:04,000
I Love You!

420
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,125
Damn you crook!

421
00:25:09,042 --> 00:25:10,042
Hey you,

422
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:11,750
I thought you were going
to complaint to your Dad.

423
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:14,125
But you seemed to have
written "I Love You".

424
00:25:14,667 --> 00:25:17,500
I did say will complain to Dad,

425
00:25:17,917 --> 00:25:19,833
did I ever say I
didn't love you.

426
00:25:20,083 --> 00:25:21,250
Crook!

427
00:25:21,708 --> 00:25:22,708
That's you.

428
00:25:24,125 --> 00:25:27,250
You got swept away
by my good looks.

429
00:25:27,333 --> 00:25:28,667
-Nope,
-Then!?

430
00:25:28,667 --> 00:25:30,708
I did when I saw your
picture for the first time.

431
00:25:31,792 --> 00:25:33,125
If so, then why did
you make me suffer.

432
00:25:34,333 --> 00:25:35,250
Just like that.

433
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,500
Good looks were fine,

434
00:25:38,125 --> 00:25:40,042
but was not sure
about the character.

435
00:25:42,125 --> 00:25:43,500
Apologize, for making me suffer.

436
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:51,250
Is this how even you
guys apologize?

437
00:25:56,875 --> 00:25:58,250
It was you Dad,

438
00:25:58,375 --> 00:26:01,083
who had asked to do,
whatever he asks for.

439
00:26:05,208 --> 00:26:10,250
Parents are the last one to know
about their children's relationship.

440
00:26:13,792 --> 00:26:14,917
Dear.

441
00:26:17,042 --> 00:26:18,042
Dear.

442
00:26:19,417 --> 00:26:21,250
Talk something dear.

443
00:26:23,125 --> 00:26:23,792
Hey!

444
00:26:24,042 --> 00:26:25,500
I had asked you to talk.

445
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:28,333
Enough of talking dear.

446
00:26:28,375 --> 00:26:29,333
Kiss me dear.

447
00:26:29,375 --> 00:26:31,250
-I won't.
-Won't you?

448
00:26:31,375 --> 00:26:32,375
Look what I'm going to do...

449
00:26:32,625 --> 00:26:34,833
God save me from him,

450
00:26:34,875 --> 00:26:37,875
God save me from him!

451
00:26:45,042 --> 00:26:46,000
Dear.

452
00:26:46,417 --> 00:26:48,750
We should stay the same forever.

453
00:26:49,458 --> 00:26:51,167
You shouldn't scold your Dear.

454
00:26:51,958 --> 00:26:53,250
Shouldn't fight.

455
00:26:53,542 --> 00:26:54,333
Ok!

456
00:26:56,417 --> 00:26:59,458
Do you like me or
your mother the most?

457
00:27:01,333 --> 00:27:03,458
Can't you women stop
asking this question!?

458
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:07,167
Dear!

459
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:09,167
Hug me.

460
00:27:10,625 --> 00:27:11,625
A bit more,

461
00:27:14,792 --> 00:27:15,875
tighter,

462
00:27:19,458 --> 00:27:22,000
hug me until I'm a part of you.

463
00:27:26,417 --> 00:27:28,167
In Tamilnadu Police Department,

464
00:27:28,167 --> 00:27:31,167
Thirty new DSP's
have taken charge.

465
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:35,042
Theeran Thirumaaran, has taken
the charge as Tuticorin's DSP.

466
00:27:35,708 --> 00:27:37,417
They've kidnapped my child.

467
00:27:37,958 --> 00:27:40,458
and demanding a sum of
one million as ransom.

468
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:43,750
Sir, somehow please save him.

469
00:28:46,167 --> 00:28:47,583
Where the hell is that DSP?

470
00:28:47,625 --> 00:28:49,542
in spite of repeated warnings
he laid hands on my men.

471
00:28:49,542 --> 00:28:51,167
Won't you listen to what
the MLA has to say?

472
00:28:51,667 --> 00:28:53,417
Don't you know how to respect?

473
00:28:53,458 --> 00:28:54,000
Don't you get it?

474
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,250
Don't you know how to respect?

475
00:28:56,167 --> 00:28:57,375
Is this respect enough?

476
00:28:59,542 --> 00:29:00,250
Hey!

477
00:29:00,583 --> 00:29:02,833
Can't you favour bribery
and stay in one place?

478
00:29:02,917 --> 00:29:03,625
How many more transfers...Huh!?

479
00:29:03,625 --> 00:29:04,958
You were the one who
wished to see places,

480
00:29:17,542 --> 00:29:20,458
Don't try heroism, to get your
pictures in the newspapers.

481
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,250
He overpowers
everywhere he goes.

482
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:24,667
You find excuses
to do encounters.

483
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:25,708
Sir.

484
00:29:26,458 --> 00:29:29,500
A girl who got in to an auto
last week during the night,

485
00:29:29,667 --> 00:29:31,167
the driver and his
two friends...

486
00:29:31,458 --> 00:29:34,167
closed her mouth, and broke her
hand on the vehicle's railing.

487
00:29:34,458 --> 00:29:37,167
Threatened her and took her
into the bushes and raped her.

488
00:29:37,583 --> 00:29:40,333
Took that injured girl in
the auto for about 10 kms,

489
00:29:40,458 --> 00:29:41,750
and again raped her.

490
00:29:42,167 --> 00:29:43,708
They did the same thing thrice.

491
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:45,792
And when they were about to
slit her throat with a bottle,

492
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:47,875
said that, she's the sole
bread winner of her family.

493
00:29:48,083 --> 00:29:49,250
You've already broke my arm,

494
00:29:49,333 --> 00:29:51,000
you got everything
you wished for.

495
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:53,167
For god sake, let me live.

496
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:55,125
She pleaded with
that broken arm.

497
00:29:56,250 --> 00:29:57,875
Still they slit her throat.

498
00:29:58,375 --> 00:29:59,625
Those three ********!

499
00:30:01,667 --> 00:30:03,458
I managed to nab those accused.

500
00:30:04,917 --> 00:30:06,500
What should I do now?

501
00:30:06,583 --> 00:30:07,917
What are you going to do?

502
00:30:18,333 --> 00:30:19,708
Open the door sir.

503
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:21,875
Our vehicle met with an
accident on the highway.

504
00:30:22,667 --> 00:30:25,083
A child is injured
and is bleeding.

505
00:30:25,375 --> 00:30:27,667
We need to call an ambulance,
please open the door.

506
00:30:27,833 --> 00:30:28,833
Wait I'm coming.

507
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:31,458
Dad!

508
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,583
Who...the...hell...is...that!?

509
00:30:44,875 --> 00:30:48,250
HEY!

510
00:31:00,667 --> 00:31:02,917
Cholavaram of
Thiruvallur District,

511
00:31:02,958 --> 00:31:04,250
late last night.

512
00:31:04,375 --> 00:31:06,167
Close to the National Highway,

513
00:31:06,208 --> 00:31:08,417
A burgle which took place
at lonely house there...

514
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,875
Five victims with jaw broken,

515
00:31:10,875 --> 00:31:12,000
and heads smashed.

516
00:31:12,042 --> 00:31:14,708
Also few were shot in the heart,

517
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:16,458
and killed in a
very gore manner.

518
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:19,542
An exact same incident occurred
last year at Gummidipoondi.

519
00:31:19,583 --> 00:31:20,875
Police couldn't catch them.

520
00:31:20,958 --> 00:31:22,708
Public are scared
to sleep at nights.

521
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:24,208
Police has to catch
them immediately.

522
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:25,250
Relatives,

523
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:27,250
neighbors, we tend to
suspect each and everyone.

524
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:28,375
On behalf of
Bharithiyaar Committee,

525
00:31:28,375 --> 00:31:30,917
ten members are patrolling
every night on the roads.

526
00:31:30,958 --> 00:31:32,083
We're not able to go for jobs.

527
00:31:32,125 --> 00:31:33,250
Police don't seem to care.

528
00:31:33,333 --> 00:31:35,542
The officer who investigated
at the crime scene,

529
00:31:35,583 --> 00:31:37,417
Sathya of Cholavaram
Police Station.

530
00:31:37,458 --> 00:31:40,667
Addressed stating that they'll
catch hold of the burglars soon.

531
00:31:56,167 --> 00:31:57,167
-Sir.
-Sir.

532
00:32:00,167 --> 00:32:01,208
-Priya.
-Huh?

533
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:01,833
Inspector Sathya.

534
00:32:01,875 --> 00:32:02,708
-Hello Ma'am.
-Hi.

535
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:04,167
-Keys to the house.
-Thank you.

536
00:32:04,708 --> 00:32:07,458
All these are Inspector's
ancestor's wealth.

537
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,750
That yellow building
there is their house.

538
00:32:09,875 --> 00:32:12,125
This village looks
exactly like ours.

539
00:32:12,167 --> 00:32:13,500
This house is awesome.

540
00:32:13,542 --> 00:32:14,958
-More than me?
-Yes.

541
00:32:15,042 --> 00:32:16,000
You're too much.

542
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:23,625
A little higher.

543
00:32:23,667 --> 00:32:24,667
A bit more.

544
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,333
-Hey!
-Ouch!

545
00:32:28,042 --> 00:32:29,750
This is you and that's me.

546
00:32:33,042 --> 00:32:34,250
Hope you guys are doing good?

547
00:32:34,333 --> 00:32:34,875
My parents.

548
00:32:34,917 --> 00:32:36,375
Dad...take this.

549
00:32:36,375 --> 00:32:37,625
-Greetings.
-Greetings, Sir.

550
00:32:37,667 --> 00:32:39,542
The house is awesome, thanks.

551
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:42,250
The house on top of DSP office
is occupied by other officers.

552
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:43,417
That's why I opted
for a private house.

553
00:32:43,417 --> 00:32:44,875
That's why I'm thanking you.

554
00:32:45,167 --> 00:32:47,167
House on top of the
office is boring.

555
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:50,167
Hey.

556
00:32:50,417 --> 00:32:51,542
why do you have a long face?

557
00:32:51,625 --> 00:32:53,167
She's pissed 'cause, we
didn't get her a doll.

558
00:32:53,333 --> 00:32:54,917
Is that so, wait.

559
00:32:56,917 --> 00:32:58,542
The small lion is you,

560
00:32:58,708 --> 00:33:00,042
and the big lion is me.

561
00:33:00,125 --> 00:33:01,333
Shall we play?

562
00:33:08,792 --> 00:33:09,667
We're leaving.

563
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,250
We stay close to you,

564
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:12,667
give me call if you
need anything at all.

565
00:33:12,708 --> 00:33:13,667
I'm leaving Ma'am.

566
00:33:13,667 --> 00:33:14,583
I'm leaving too.

567
00:33:14,625 --> 00:33:16,583
Sathya arrange for the
Calling on tomorrow.

568
00:33:16,625 --> 00:33:17,625
-Sir!
-Sir!

569
00:33:17,667 --> 00:33:19,250
-Heard that new DSP is here.
-That's right.

570
00:33:19,375 --> 00:33:20,708
We heard a lot about you.

571
00:33:20,792 --> 00:33:22,083
We're glad to be
working with you.

572
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:23,125
-Thank you.
-Sir.

573
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:25,250
I would like to meet the local
big shots and Thasildar.

574
00:33:25,333 --> 00:33:26,250
Make arrangements.

575
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:28,625
Keep all the pending
case files on my table.

576
00:33:29,708 --> 00:33:31,708
Amongst the 100's
of pending case,

577
00:33:32,042 --> 00:33:33,500
as an ordinary case,

578
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:36,042
that case came to my table.

579
00:33:36,333 --> 00:33:39,333
Was unaware of the
danger hidden in it.

580
00:33:42,167 --> 00:33:44,250
How come such a gore
dacait case is pending?

581
00:33:44,792 --> 00:33:45,958
Didn't you guys do anything?

582
00:33:45,958 --> 00:33:46,917
We did investigate.

583
00:33:47,042 --> 00:33:49,042
Except for the fingerprints,
we don't have any other clue.

584
00:33:49,125 --> 00:33:50,458
Is it a new or an old team?

585
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,083
Was it just one or
were there others too?

586
00:33:52,083 --> 00:33:53,458
we're not able to figure it out.

587
00:33:53,542 --> 00:33:56,250
We couldn't follow up on this
case amongst many cases.

588
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:04,542
Hey!

589
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:07,167
Send me off to my parents, then
sit and read the file in peace.

590
00:34:07,167 --> 00:34:08,083
I'm fed up.

591
00:34:10,958 --> 00:34:11,833
Priya.

592
00:34:12,417 --> 00:34:13,208
Come here.

593
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:15,958
Come closer dear.

594
00:34:22,125 --> 00:34:24,500
How do you manage to
be so beautiful dear?

595
00:34:26,042 --> 00:34:28,250
Chubby Cheeks,

596
00:34:29,167 --> 00:34:31,375
luscious lips,

597
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:35,250
big beautiful eyes,

598
00:34:36,708 --> 00:34:39,583
sharp nose like a parrot.

599
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:41,250
Hey dear!?

600
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:43,375
You promised me a new nose ring,

601
00:34:43,417 --> 00:34:44,667
where's it? uh?

602
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:47,917
I'm extremely romantic here,

603
00:34:48,083 --> 00:34:49,583
and you're all about nose ring.

604
00:34:49,583 --> 00:34:51,125
-nose ring right?
-I won't ask, I won't!

605
00:34:59,875 --> 00:35:01,250
Open the door, Sir.

606
00:35:01,917 --> 00:35:04,125
Our vehicle met with an
accident on the highway.

607
00:35:51,042 --> 00:35:52,042
...Mummy!

608
00:35:52,625 --> 00:35:54,167
Siddhu!

609
00:36:11,875 --> 00:36:12,875
Siddhu!

610
00:36:20,083 --> 00:36:21,208
There are two more bodies inside.

611
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:22,750
They've killed
them like animals.

612
00:36:23,083 --> 00:36:24,250
Motive is same as
before, Sathya.

613
00:36:24,917 --> 00:36:26,792
Why isn't the forensic
team here yet?

614
00:36:26,875 --> 00:36:28,542
Ask them come immediately and take
the blood samples and fingerprints.

615
00:36:28,583 --> 00:36:28,875
Yes sir.

616
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,125
Shouldn't miss out
on any evidence,

617
00:36:30,167 --> 00:36:31,500
ask them search every
bit of the place.

618
00:36:31,542 --> 00:36:33,542
Make arrangements for
Line Method Search.

619
00:37:21,958 --> 00:37:23,583
In Thiruvallur District,

620
00:37:23,625 --> 00:37:25,167
this is the third time.

621
00:37:25,167 --> 00:37:27,625
A gore theft has taken place.

622
00:37:27,625 --> 00:37:28,708
Serial Killing,

623
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:29,875
Gory deaths,

624
00:37:29,875 --> 00:37:31,125
Masked Burglars,

625
00:37:31,167 --> 00:37:32,833
what is the Police doing?

626
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:35,250
"What was the Crime Committed"

627
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:38,833
How's it possible to safeguard such a
huge highway with just 10 Policemen?

628
00:37:39,042 --> 00:37:41,042
Adding to that Vajpayee's
highway work is on.

629
00:37:41,125 --> 00:37:42,667
Don't know who's coming in
and going out of the town.

630
00:37:42,708 --> 00:37:45,208
Earlier I use to keep the shop
open till 11 in the night.

631
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:47,333
But now I get home
the minute sun sets.

632
00:37:47,375 --> 00:37:49,958
It's really scary to go
on cycle at late nights.

633
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,667
Since I saw the gory incident
at Sharadha's house,

634
00:37:53,667 --> 00:37:55,667
not able to go to work.

635
00:37:55,708 --> 00:37:57,208
Not able to attend weddings,

636
00:37:57,250 --> 00:38:00,875
we're scared even to sleep along
with children during the night.

637
00:38:00,958 --> 00:38:03,750
Before the public loses hope
on the Police Department,

638
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:05,875
will the Police department take steps
to drive away the public's fear.

639
00:38:05,917 --> 00:38:06,917
CRIME!?

640
00:38:07,375 --> 00:38:08,375
-Sathya.
-Sir!

641
00:38:08,458 --> 00:38:10,167
Send a fax to all the Police
Stations in Tamilnadu.

642
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:12,208
I need observation report
of similar cases,

643
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:15,542
photos, videos, dog squad details,
fingerprints, footmarks, tire-marks.

644
00:38:15,583 --> 00:38:16,958
Material objects,
physical evidence.

645
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,667
In quest report, postmortem report, and
all such reports related to this case.

646
00:38:23,083 --> 00:38:25,250
there were many cases
surfacing similar to it.

647
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:26,500
One gang,

648
00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:27,750
at many places.

649
00:38:27,917 --> 00:38:30,167
have burgled and
murdered people.

650
00:38:30,792 --> 00:38:32,375
In desperation to get a clue,

651
00:38:32,625 --> 00:38:35,083
we started investigating
thieves from the accused list.

652
00:38:35,625 --> 00:38:37,250
Stealing is an art.

653
00:38:37,625 --> 00:38:39,125
Just by looking at the house.

654
00:38:39,208 --> 00:38:40,958
You should be able to judge if there's
money and jewels in that house.

655
00:38:41,167 --> 00:38:42,708
Looking at clothes drying,

656
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:43,667
men and women,

657
00:38:43,667 --> 00:38:45,750
number of servants
should be understood.

658
00:38:45,792 --> 00:38:46,708
Is there a dog?

659
00:38:46,708 --> 00:38:48,417
Is it a local breed or
an international one,

660
00:38:48,458 --> 00:38:50,042
what does it like to eat?

661
00:38:50,042 --> 00:38:51,375
If we take the tools,

662
00:38:51,458 --> 00:38:53,958
you Policemen nab us suspecting.

663
00:38:53,958 --> 00:38:56,875
So, we got to arrange the tools
from the house we steal.

664
00:38:57,458 --> 00:38:59,042
We should get in without
making a sound.

665
00:38:59,417 --> 00:39:00,583
Just with the smell,

666
00:39:00,625 --> 00:39:03,500
we need to figure out which
is the bedroom and kitchen.

667
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:04,875
By touching,

668
00:39:04,917 --> 00:39:07,625
need to figure out which is
a drawer and the cupboard.

669
00:39:07,667 --> 00:39:09,542
Then finally take out
the keys quietly.

670
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:11,167
Should sweep everything soon,

671
00:39:11,167 --> 00:39:13,250
and if possible grab
a good meal there.

672
00:39:13,333 --> 00:39:14,417
And leave from there quickly.

673
00:39:14,458 --> 00:39:15,667
We're artist sir.

674
00:39:15,708 --> 00:39:18,417
And you're insulting
us of being murderers.

675
00:39:18,417 --> 00:39:19,417
Go and mind your business...

676
00:39:20,667 --> 00:39:21,667
Stand straight!

677
00:39:27,667 --> 00:39:28,500
He's testing my patience.

678
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:29,500
Give me that Sathya.

679
00:39:33,792 --> 00:39:34,958
Now that's how you whack.

680
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,667
I'm only in to cupboard pulling.

681
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:38,917
200ml of Oil.

682
00:39:38,958 --> 00:39:40,833
And ash to get a
grip while climbing.

683
00:39:41,125 --> 00:39:43,833
We pick houses with cupboards
kept near the windows.

684
00:39:43,875 --> 00:39:45,458
Climb on to those,

685
00:39:45,542 --> 00:39:48,583
and pour oil under the
cupboard and move them.

686
00:39:48,667 --> 00:39:51,250
Then the cupboard will
dance to your tune.

687
00:39:51,417 --> 00:39:52,417
Job done.

688
00:39:52,458 --> 00:39:53,792
God is our partner,

689
00:39:53,833 --> 00:39:55,417
so whenever I steal
I share with him.

690
00:39:55,458 --> 00:39:57,167
If I don't then God
won't spare me.

691
00:39:57,208 --> 00:39:58,458
It will gouch my eyes out.

692
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,583
I don't know who was it.

693
00:39:59,667 --> 00:40:00,750
I didn't do it.

694
00:40:00,792 --> 00:40:01,958
Sir, it wasn't me.

695
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:02,917
Sir, don't hit me please.

696
00:40:02,958 --> 00:40:04,792
We don't buy stolen jewels.

697
00:40:04,792 --> 00:40:06,583
Buddy, Police is here, run.

698
00:40:06,625 --> 00:40:07,667
Sir, don't hit us.

699
00:40:07,708 --> 00:40:09,833
Sir, we have no idea who's
it, please let us go.

700
00:40:11,958 --> 00:40:14,500
There was a Keravas
caste gang in Trichy,

701
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:17,250
there was Maariappan gang
while I was in department.

702
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:19,458
They will lie about their caste.

703
00:40:19,458 --> 00:40:21,250
I've been an Informer
for Twenty Five years,

704
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:23,000
never have I seen such a case.

705
00:40:23,042 --> 00:40:24,042
The technique seems to be new,

706
00:40:24,167 --> 00:40:25,375
no idea who it must be.

707
00:40:25,417 --> 00:40:26,000
In Tamilnadu,

708
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:26,458
using a gun,

709
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:27,125
to steal,

710
00:40:27,167 --> 00:40:28,167
no one does that.

711
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:29,042
Take out the license.

712
00:40:29,083 --> 00:40:31,375
Put up a notice warning
all the lonely houses.

713
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:38,750
There have been many cases across
Tamilnadu similar to this.

714
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:39,500
This one is from Wallajah.

715
00:40:39,542 --> 00:40:41,958
They've knocked hard
on this kid's head.

716
00:40:41,958 --> 00:40:43,542
due to which she
lost her memory.

717
00:40:43,583 --> 00:40:44,333
This is from Cholavaram.

718
00:40:44,375 --> 00:40:45,708
They broke his jaw.

719
00:40:45,792 --> 00:40:47,625
We've done a jaw replacement
surgery for him.

720
00:40:47,958 --> 00:40:48,833
This is from Gummidipoondi.

721
00:40:48,875 --> 00:40:50,167
How many times will
you investigate?

722
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:51,500
They will have to be hacked.

723
00:40:51,583 --> 00:40:53,250
You can't harm them in any way.

724
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:54,250
Please leave Sir.

725
00:40:54,250 --> 00:40:55,000
Sit down.

726
00:40:55,542 --> 00:40:57,542
This is from Dakut,
it's our new DSP.

727
00:40:57,833 --> 00:40:59,208
It was my dream sir.

728
00:40:59,458 --> 00:41:01,333
To build a house of my own,

729
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:04,250
and to live happily
with my children.

730
00:41:04,333 --> 00:41:07,333
I didn't want my children
to go through what I did.

731
00:41:07,458 --> 00:41:09,000
I sacrificed a lot,

732
00:41:09,042 --> 00:41:11,333
managed to save up
and bought a house.

733
00:41:11,333 --> 00:41:13,333
We were happy with our lives.

734
00:41:13,375 --> 00:41:14,875
One unfortunate night,

735
00:41:15,167 --> 00:41:18,083
they destroyed everything.

736
00:41:21,167 --> 00:41:22,167
Sir!

737
00:41:22,167 --> 00:41:23,750
This situation of this family,

738
00:41:23,792 --> 00:41:25,833
shouldn't be endured
by any other family.

739
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:27,875
Don't let them go, Sir.

740
00:41:27,917 --> 00:41:29,792
Don't let them go.

741
00:41:30,167 --> 00:41:32,542
Don't let them go, Sir.

742
00:41:32,917 --> 00:41:35,417
Don't let them go.

743
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:37,500
Kabe.

744
00:41:37,625 --> 00:41:38,500
Kabe.

745
00:41:39,917 --> 00:41:40,750
Kabe.

746
00:41:41,042 --> 00:41:41,833
Kabe.

747
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:42,750
Kabe.

748
00:41:43,458 --> 00:41:44,167
Kabe.

749
00:41:44,167 --> 00:41:44,833
Kabe.

750
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:46,000
Kabe.

751
00:41:46,417 --> 00:41:47,125
Kabe!

752
00:41:48,375 --> 00:41:56,333
KABE!

753
00:42:01,875 --> 00:42:05,875
I started investigation, thinking
this will be a simple one too,

754
00:42:06,167 --> 00:42:07,167
but it wasn't simple.

755
00:42:07,708 --> 00:42:09,875
It's a very rare and
a serious case.

756
00:42:10,208 --> 00:42:11,375
Who are these Dacoits?

757
00:42:11,458 --> 00:42:12,125
No idea.

758
00:42:12,167 --> 00:42:13,208
How do they travel?

759
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:14,708
How do they manage
to steal and evade?

760
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:15,458
No idea.

761
00:42:15,625 --> 00:42:18,083
How are they able to kill
someone with just one blow?

762
00:42:18,125 --> 00:42:18,667
No idea.

763
00:42:18,875 --> 00:42:20,708
Why isn't there even
one eye witness?

764
00:42:20,708 --> 00:42:21,417
No idea.

765
00:42:21,542 --> 00:42:25,042
This gang is very smart, which
leaves us with just questions.

766
00:42:25,333 --> 00:42:27,750
But they are quite a fools
to leave their fingerprints.

767
00:42:27,792 --> 00:42:30,000
This kind of motive is something
new to our department.

768
00:42:30,458 --> 00:42:33,167
When we compared the
fingerprints across Tamilnadu,

769
00:42:33,542 --> 00:42:35,292
it didn't match with
any of the criminals.

770
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:36,583
But...

771
00:42:37,208 --> 00:42:38,167
...it did match

772
00:42:40,875 --> 00:42:42,625
Since 1995 till last week,

773
00:42:42,708 --> 00:42:46,125
it matched with 22 of such similar
cases of thefts and murders.

774
00:42:46,792 --> 00:42:48,542
It's not an old gang.

775
00:42:48,833 --> 00:42:49,792
They're a new gang.

776
00:42:50,083 --> 00:42:51,000
It's just one gang,

777
00:42:51,042 --> 00:42:53,042
who have been evading without
getting caught for 9 years.

778
00:42:53,292 --> 00:42:54,542
If we don't catch them.

779
00:42:54,750 --> 00:42:55,750
They'll continue to do so.

780
00:42:56,167 --> 00:42:58,083
Till date, 'cause of them
there have been 18 deaths,

781
00:42:58,208 --> 00:42:59,667
Sixty have lost their
eyes and ears,

782
00:42:59,667 --> 00:43:00,958
with broken jaws
and are in coma,

783
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,292
losing their day to day life.

784
00:43:04,083 --> 00:43:06,667
I'm wondering how come our
department was negligent about this,

785
00:43:07,458 --> 00:43:08,833
I'm not able to sleep.

786
00:43:09,667 --> 00:43:11,417
The cries of kids
and old people...

787
00:43:11,875 --> 00:43:13,125
...is reverberating in my mind.

788
00:43:13,875 --> 00:43:16,083
Lives of public is lost eventually
in one crime or another.

789
00:43:16,125 --> 00:43:17,625
Why are you taking
this to your heart?

790
00:43:17,667 --> 00:43:19,833
Even a passer by takes a moment
to stand up against crime.

791
00:43:20,250 --> 00:43:21,917
We're are paid to do the same,

792
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,125
and we live on that money.

793
00:43:23,375 --> 00:43:25,292
I feel ashamed to
lead such a life.

794
00:43:26,375 --> 00:43:27,542
I'm not sure how's it with you.

795
00:43:30,875 --> 00:43:31,958
What shall we do Theeran?

796
00:43:32,042 --> 00:43:34,458
All victims have been killed
with a blow on side of the head.

797
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:36,125
It's a technique used
to kill animals.

798
00:43:36,583 --> 00:43:38,083
Only the people who hunt,

799
00:43:38,125 --> 00:43:39,750
can do such treacherous murders.

800
00:43:40,167 --> 00:43:41,667
They've used country guns,

801
00:43:41,833 --> 00:43:43,292
we don't have such
guns in Tamilnadu.

802
00:43:43,833 --> 00:43:45,792
The slipper from the
last place of the crime,

803
00:43:45,833 --> 00:43:47,292
gutkha cover and empty shell,

804
00:43:47,375 --> 00:43:49,625
none of the items
are from Tamilnadu.

805
00:43:50,375 --> 00:43:52,333
So, with the permission of DGP,

806
00:43:52,458 --> 00:43:53,458
along with a big team,

807
00:43:53,583 --> 00:43:54,583
we need to search across India.

808
00:43:54,667 --> 00:43:56,292
So you want to do a
pan India search?

809
00:43:56,458 --> 00:43:57,833
Are you kidding?

810
00:43:57,917 --> 00:43:59,542
Just to catch a
bunch of thieves,

811
00:43:59,542 --> 00:44:00,750
you're asking for troops.

812
00:44:00,833 --> 00:44:03,042
It's a heavily
populated country.

813
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:06,000
Any idea how many Prisons,
Police Stations, Courts...

814
00:44:06,083 --> 00:44:07,583
...and record rooms are there?

815
00:44:07,625 --> 00:44:10,000
With just fingerprints, do
you think can find them!?

816
00:44:10,042 --> 00:44:12,625
What have you done so far,
except for warming benches?

817
00:44:12,667 --> 00:44:13,958
Leave, wait outside.

818
00:44:16,458 --> 00:44:18,250
Can't take a hasty
decision on this,

819
00:44:18,292 --> 00:44:20,458
let's escalate this
and see what happens.

820
00:44:24,083 --> 00:44:24,958
Didn't agree.

821
00:44:25,333 --> 00:44:26,667
The Public is not safe.

822
00:44:26,708 --> 00:44:27,875
We've to do something.

823
00:44:28,792 --> 00:44:31,625
Form a special crime party
within our limitations.

824
00:44:31,750 --> 00:44:33,667
I'll give you a van, you can
use that for investigation.

825
00:44:33,667 --> 00:44:35,292
If it's far, then take a train.

826
00:44:36,958 --> 00:44:39,333
I left Priya with
a lady constable.

827
00:44:39,542 --> 00:44:40,458
One slipper,

828
00:44:40,458 --> 00:44:41,250
empty shell,

829
00:44:41,292 --> 00:44:42,292
with fingerprints,

830
00:44:42,333 --> 00:44:44,583
went on in search of the
criminals across India.

831
00:44:49,125 --> 00:44:52,583
Across Andhra, all the drivers
wear this kind of slippers.

832
00:44:52,583 --> 00:44:54,458
We can't find anything
with this as evidence.

833
00:44:54,458 --> 00:44:56,042
Just like you've mentioned,

834
00:44:56,042 --> 00:44:57,375
there are three similar
cases with us too.

835
00:44:57,375 --> 00:44:59,875
We've been in search of
them for past 10 years.

836
00:45:03,708 --> 00:45:04,792
Sir...Sir!

837
00:45:05,708 --> 00:45:07,292
Brother, who was that?

838
00:45:07,333 --> 00:45:08,208
It's the SP.

839
00:45:08,333 --> 00:45:09,208
Sir!?

840
00:45:09,542 --> 00:45:11,083
Is this the respect
they give to their SP?

841
00:45:11,833 --> 00:45:13,750
Sathya, there's a union
present here for the Police.

842
00:45:13,833 --> 00:45:14,958
Can't do anything about it.

843
00:45:15,333 --> 00:45:16,667
Ask him, if we can get in?

844
00:45:16,708 --> 00:45:17,708
Brother!

845
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,542
These guns are available
here in abundance.

846
00:45:22,583 --> 00:45:23,875
This can't be considered
as a vital evidence.

847
00:45:23,917 --> 00:45:25,917
We have 4 cases pending
similar to these.

848
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,083
We suspect it must the be
the Poorthi Criminal Tribe.

849
00:45:30,167 --> 00:45:31,833
Keravas gang are
known for this style,

850
00:45:31,875 --> 00:45:33,042
check in Chandrapur District.

851
00:45:33,042 --> 00:45:35,042
No, no, no, it's not Keravas,

852
00:45:35,292 --> 00:45:37,250
they always enter
from the backdoor.

853
00:45:37,250 --> 00:45:38,833
But in your case,
it's the front door.

854
00:45:38,875 --> 00:45:40,625
I think it must be Sanjar Bhats.

855
00:45:41,833 --> 00:45:43,458
During these two years
of our marriage,

856
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,167
I've never left Priya
alone for this long.

857
00:45:46,458 --> 00:45:47,667
With the little funds we had,

858
00:45:47,750 --> 00:45:49,250
we slept at schools and Dhabas.

859
00:45:49,375 --> 00:45:50,458
Ate what we could find,

860
00:45:50,542 --> 00:45:52,042
and went on from state to state.

861
00:45:52,167 --> 00:45:54,333
People started to get sick.

862
00:45:54,917 --> 00:45:56,000
It's the Hawarias,

863
00:45:56,208 --> 00:45:57,708
they're a dreadful gang.

864
00:45:58,042 --> 00:45:59,417
It's really hard to catch them.

865
00:45:59,458 --> 00:46:01,917
They're a heredity
of Criminal Tribes,

866
00:46:01,958 --> 00:46:06,083
Criminal Tribes is a word which was found
by Westerners to burrow their lands.

867
00:46:06,125 --> 00:46:07,708
Read this you'll understand.

868
00:46:08,833 --> 00:46:11,083
"The Hide 'n' Attack
technique of Wolves"

869
00:46:11,250 --> 00:46:12,833
"Where one chases, and
the others hunt..."

870
00:46:12,917 --> 00:46:14,792
This search of mine
for criminals,

871
00:46:14,875 --> 00:46:19,458
lead to history of many strange
crimes happening across India.

872
00:46:19,625 --> 00:46:21,458
Every place we went,
just like Tamilnadu...

873
00:46:21,458 --> 00:46:23,750
...there were pending
cases gorier than ours.

874
00:46:23,792 --> 00:46:25,917
We collected the fingerprints
from those cases,

875
00:46:26,083 --> 00:46:28,250
and compared it with the
chance fingerprints,

876
00:46:28,458 --> 00:46:30,333
and it was just one gang
who were behind all this.

877
00:46:32,792 --> 00:46:33,792
Which gang is it?

878
00:46:33,833 --> 00:46:34,833
Is it Poorthis?

879
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,083
Sanjar Bhats?

880
00:46:36,083 --> 00:46:37,083
Hawarias?

881
00:46:37,333 --> 00:46:38,708
or it's the Soonsis?

882
00:46:39,083 --> 00:46:39,958
or Binglus?

883
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,792
Who must be it?

884
00:46:43,625 --> 00:46:46,833
After going through the statements and
evidences pertaining to that gang,

885
00:46:46,958 --> 00:46:48,375
something struck me.

886
00:46:48,375 --> 00:46:51,458
I categorized their thefts,
according to the dates it occurred.

887
00:46:53,250 --> 00:46:54,667
I got a small clue.

888
00:46:54,917 --> 00:46:55,792
First,

889
00:46:56,583 --> 00:46:58,083
After 1995-96,

890
00:46:58,208 --> 00:46:59,375
not only in Tamilnadu,

891
00:46:59,625 --> 00:47:00,958
but across India,

892
00:47:01,167 --> 00:47:03,125
they were missing in
action for 4 years.

893
00:47:04,167 --> 00:47:04,958
Why?

894
00:47:05,875 --> 00:47:07,583
Chances of them getting
arrested was high.

895
00:47:08,708 --> 00:47:09,542
Where could it be?

896
00:47:10,083 --> 00:47:10,958
Second,

897
00:47:11,250 --> 00:47:14,292
It's a statement given by an accused
in Tirupathi 10 years back.

898
00:47:14,708 --> 00:47:15,792
I'm small time,

899
00:47:15,875 --> 00:47:16,667
from a small gang.

900
00:47:17,042 --> 00:47:18,833
The lorry gangs do
it 4 times a week.

901
00:47:19,417 --> 00:47:20,375
Let me go.

902
00:47:20,417 --> 00:47:21,708
I'll help you in all the cases.

903
00:47:22,042 --> 00:47:23,333
Just looking at the crime scene,

904
00:47:23,833 --> 00:47:25,542
I can tell which gang
would've done it.

905
00:47:25,583 --> 00:47:26,125
Third,

906
00:47:26,583 --> 00:47:28,292
even I feel, it must
be the lorry gang.

907
00:47:29,208 --> 00:47:30,750
Second month of 2002,

908
00:47:31,125 --> 00:47:32,708
on the 14th at Gummidipoondi,

909
00:47:32,958 --> 00:47:34,458
16th at Aathur,

910
00:47:34,833 --> 00:47:37,167
and on 18th Kaarimanglam
Dharmapuri.

911
00:47:37,708 --> 00:47:40,542
finally on 19th in the
outer region of Bangalore.

912
00:47:41,625 --> 00:47:45,292
They must be doing it when they
go to and fro carrying goods.

913
00:47:45,792 --> 00:47:46,708
-Sathya!
-Sir!

914
00:47:46,708 --> 00:47:48,375
That accused is still
at Tirupathi prison.

915
00:47:48,458 --> 00:47:49,542
Bail him out,

916
00:47:49,625 --> 00:47:50,667
and take him to the crime scene.

917
00:47:50,667 --> 00:47:52,333
-Ok Sir.
-Ask him if it's the Lorry gang.

918
00:47:52,375 --> 00:47:54,375
This is definitely is
the work of Lorry Gang.

919
00:47:54,667 --> 00:47:56,792
How can you be so sure
it's the Lorry Gang?

920
00:47:56,792 --> 00:47:59,375
With the forensic
report of the victims.

921
00:47:59,458 --> 00:48:01,583
They were attacked
with a strange weapon,

922
00:48:01,833 --> 00:48:04,250
It's nothing but the flag rod
attached in trucks up north.

923
00:48:04,333 --> 00:48:06,125
They use these
rods to kill them,

924
00:48:06,292 --> 00:48:08,458
and then fix those rods
back on to the trucks.

925
00:48:08,458 --> 00:48:10,375
No Police can track them.

926
00:48:10,375 --> 00:48:12,583
Why don't to ransack all the
trucks and take the fingerprints?

927
00:48:12,625 --> 00:48:13,375
No Sir.

928
00:48:13,458 --> 00:48:14,625
It'll become the headlines.

929
00:48:14,708 --> 00:48:16,167
It might alert the accused.

930
00:48:16,167 --> 00:48:17,250
Let's form a special team,

931
00:48:17,250 --> 00:48:19,083
and find the place where
they got arrested.

932
00:48:19,167 --> 00:48:21,667
But the only evidence we
have is their fingerprints.

933
00:48:21,917 --> 00:48:24,750
Up North, fingerprints are taken
only after they're convicted.

934
00:48:24,750 --> 00:48:25,708
That becomes an issue.

935
00:48:25,750 --> 00:48:26,750
Just like Sherlock Holmes,

936
00:48:26,792 --> 00:48:31,667
you traveled in and out of 2003-05', and
spinning stories of rods and trucks.

937
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,250
Why don't you admit,
that can't catch them.

938
00:48:34,333 --> 00:48:35,167
No Sir.

939
00:48:35,292 --> 00:48:36,583
We can find them for sure.

940
00:48:36,667 --> 00:48:40,542
If at all this gang kills a big
officer like you or a Politician,

941
00:48:40,958 --> 00:48:42,375
which will eventually
happen for sure.

942
00:48:42,542 --> 00:48:45,458
Then this Govt. and the department
will take this case seriously.

943
00:48:45,625 --> 00:48:47,250
Then we can find them for sure.

944
00:48:47,333 --> 00:48:49,375
'Cause you don't care the
lives of the public.

945
00:48:49,708 --> 00:48:51,125
-Theeran!
-Sorry Sir.

946
00:48:52,458 --> 00:48:55,042
We're traveling in
between other cases.

947
00:48:55,167 --> 00:48:57,042
That too we spend our money.

948
00:48:57,375 --> 00:49:01,250
Since the investigation had started they've
done it five times at different places.

949
00:49:01,750 --> 00:49:03,458
They've killed many in the
most dreadful manner.

950
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,417
At least now the Department
has to take this seriously.

951
00:49:10,833 --> 00:49:13,542
We neglect being a Police to
save the Good from the Evil,

952
00:49:13,625 --> 00:49:16,333
Instead we stay loyal henchmen in
saving the Evil from the Good.

953
00:49:16,375 --> 00:49:17,083
I'm leaving Sir.

954
00:49:26,250 --> 00:49:28,542
Sathya, they didn't agree to the
special team we had asked for.

955
00:49:28,583 --> 00:49:30,042
Let's wait and
watch, what happens.

956
00:49:30,083 --> 00:49:30,833
Ok!

957
00:49:32,750 --> 00:49:34,375
I saw you hiding.

958
00:49:34,667 --> 00:49:35,625
Get up!

959
00:49:35,625 --> 00:49:37,792
I called you 8 times to tell
you something important.

960
00:49:37,833 --> 00:49:39,333
Sir is busy, he's
in a meeting...

961
00:49:39,917 --> 00:49:41,458
I got these two for Rs.500/-

962
00:49:41,750 --> 00:49:43,792
Now you can talk to me
anytime with no disturbance.

963
00:49:43,958 --> 00:49:45,750
-Do you see this green button?
-I know...

964
00:49:45,958 --> 00:49:47,542
-I've seen it,
-Priya!

965
00:49:49,250 --> 00:49:51,000
It's a very important case,

966
00:49:51,083 --> 00:49:52,625
public is quite helpless.

967
00:49:52,708 --> 00:49:53,708
What about me then?

968
00:49:54,792 --> 00:49:56,125
You're my sweetheart,

969
00:49:56,125 --> 00:49:57,583
-darling!
-Don't be kidding.

970
00:49:57,625 --> 00:49:58,458
Get serious.

971
00:49:59,125 --> 00:49:59,792
Ok.

972
00:49:59,833 --> 00:50:00,625
I'm serious.

973
00:50:00,917 --> 00:50:01,750
Tell me.

974
00:50:08,292 --> 00:50:09,792
Why are showing me this stone?

975
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,000
What a fool!

976
00:50:23,375 --> 00:50:24,292
Tell me.

977
00:50:25,208 --> 00:50:26,083
Bloody Crook!

978
00:50:29,708 --> 00:50:34,917
“Would love to be the slave
of your beautiful eyes”

979
00:50:35,292 --> 00:50:40,792
“Wanna take your breath
away with my sweet kisses”

980
00:50:40,833 --> 00:50:46,375
"Oh dear, I'll be your cradle"

981
00:50:47,042 --> 00:50:52,458
"My life is ploddingly
rubbing on to yours."

982
00:50:52,708 --> 00:50:57,917
"As and when it gets excited my
heart goes out in beating as one"

983
00:50:58,125 --> 00:51:03,958
"Oh my dear, you'll
be my cradle"

984
00:51:04,250 --> 00:51:10,042
“Shall I take you in to
my arms and travel a Eon”

985
00:51:10,167 --> 00:51:15,375
“Or shall I pamper you
from head till toe”

986
00:51:15,458 --> 00:51:21,042
"Oh dear, I'll be your cradle"

987
00:51:21,125 --> 00:51:26,125
"Oh my dear, you'll
be my cradle"

988
00:51:26,583 --> 00:51:28,708
What gift shall we get for
your friend's wedding?

989
00:51:29,083 --> 00:51:29,708
Your wish.

990
00:51:30,083 --> 00:51:30,875
Your wish.

991
00:51:31,375 --> 00:51:32,125
Your wish dear.

992
00:51:33,375 --> 00:51:35,458
If it's all my wish, then
what are you there for?

993
00:51:38,458 --> 00:51:39,292
To...

994
00:51:40,083 --> 00:51:41,292
...do everything you wish for.

995
00:52:13,292 --> 00:52:18,917
"The pleasant hug in the morning,
and the whisper in the ears"

996
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:22,042
"Wouldn't end even
when I'm gone..."

997
00:52:22,083 --> 00:52:24,875
"...come oh my dear!"

998
00:52:24,875 --> 00:52:27,708
"The mellow kicks on the ear,

999
00:52:27,750 --> 00:52:30,542
while you're resting
on my chest"

1000
00:52:30,583 --> 00:52:33,625
"Won't be able to
live without it..."

1001
00:52:33,667 --> 00:52:36,375
"...come oh my dear!"

1002
00:52:36,458 --> 00:52:39,458
"I'll be like a mother to
you when you're pregnant,

1003
00:52:39,458 --> 00:52:42,208
just like the moisture
turning to rains"

1004
00:52:42,250 --> 00:52:45,208
"Then your tears
will fade away..."

1005
00:52:45,250 --> 00:52:48,417
"...and the time will
be in your favour"

1006
00:52:48,458 --> 00:52:49,875
It's done, take it.

1007
00:52:49,958 --> 00:52:52,375
Why don't you clean
them as well dear.

1008
00:52:52,417 --> 00:52:53,417
That's why...

1009
00:52:53,458 --> 00:52:55,125
...avoid chores when
your wife asks for.

1010
00:52:55,583 --> 00:52:56,125
Oh God!

1011
00:52:58,458 --> 00:52:59,333
That's why...

1012
00:52:59,417 --> 00:53:01,417
...you shouldn't argue
with your wife.

1013
00:53:02,167 --> 00:53:03,208
Be blessed!

1014
00:53:03,292 --> 00:53:03,917
Bloody!

1015
00:53:53,292 --> 00:53:54,250
Big Lion...

1016
00:53:54,375 --> 00:53:56,125
...shall we go to that forest?

1017
00:53:56,125 --> 00:53:58,375
Sure we can, but only after
you finish your meal.

1018
00:53:58,458 --> 00:53:59,250
Ok!?

1019
00:54:19,792 --> 00:54:20,792
Ruby shut up.

1020
00:54:21,292 --> 00:54:22,167
Ruby!

1021
00:54:22,208 --> 00:54:23,042
Shut up!

1022
00:54:23,083 --> 00:54:24,083
Shut up I say.

1023
00:54:26,292 --> 00:54:28,333
What's wrong with her today?

1024
00:55:05,250 --> 00:55:06,667
Take out the gun sooner.

1025
00:55:14,875 --> 00:55:15,833
Let's go.

1026
00:55:24,792 --> 00:55:27,583
Ruling party MLA Sugavanam,

1027
00:55:27,625 --> 00:55:28,875
late last night,

1028
00:55:28,917 --> 00:55:31,667
was shot dead by the
masked burglars.

1029
00:55:31,750 --> 00:55:35,750
Exactly,three other murders
of the same nature,

1030
00:55:35,833 --> 00:55:37,625
where many have been killed,

1031
00:55:37,667 --> 00:55:40,458
but when a Government leader
itself has been killed.

1032
00:55:40,583 --> 00:55:44,417
It stirred a fear and
panic among the public.

1033
00:55:44,458 --> 00:55:46,042
They couldn't protect an MLA,

1034
00:55:46,125 --> 00:55:48,042
then who will protect
the people here?

1035
00:55:48,125 --> 00:55:50,375
Police just throws a
glance and then leaves,

1036
00:55:50,375 --> 00:55:53,625
they're busy begging at the signals, how
can we expect them to nab criminals.

1037
00:55:55,458 --> 00:55:56,208
Damn!

1038
00:55:56,833 --> 00:55:58,375
The time isn't in our favour.

1039
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,833
It's not even a month, since the
death of people due to Tsunami.

1040
00:56:02,833 --> 00:56:04,208
And here we have a
murder of an MLA.

1041
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,458
What have you guys been up-to?

1042
00:56:07,417 --> 00:56:08,542
It's all in the file.

1043
00:56:08,625 --> 00:56:10,792
If I had the knowledge
to understand this,

1044
00:56:10,875 --> 00:56:12,708
I wouldn't have been
struggling as a politician.

1045
00:56:13,083 --> 00:56:15,292
Won't I prefer getting paid
monthly like you guys do?

1046
00:56:16,667 --> 00:56:18,875
Police are worse
than Politicians.

1047
00:56:19,042 --> 00:56:21,833
Better be good, if not they'll
send the burglars to your house.

1048
00:56:23,292 --> 00:56:25,167
The deaths till date
were of public,

1049
00:56:25,375 --> 00:56:26,458
not an issue.

1050
00:56:26,708 --> 00:56:27,625
But this,

1051
00:56:27,875 --> 00:56:29,208
MLA from the ruling party.

1052
00:56:29,333 --> 00:56:30,792
By-Election is
around the corner.

1053
00:56:31,042 --> 00:56:32,333
The expenses will go
through the roof.

1054
00:56:34,458 --> 00:56:35,833
Who the hell are those guys?

1055
00:56:36,458 --> 00:56:37,917
During the 19th century...

1056
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:41,125
...several common people and traders
traveling towards Northern India.

1057
00:56:41,375 --> 00:56:43,167
Were missing in most
mysterious circumstances.

1058
00:56:43,375 --> 00:56:44,875
During 1830,

1059
00:56:45,208 --> 00:56:47,000
Governor William Benedict
issued an order,

1060
00:56:47,083 --> 00:56:48,250
to William Henry Cillaman;

1061
00:56:48,375 --> 00:56:50,125
in forming a troop
for investigation.

1062
00:56:50,208 --> 00:56:51,583
A burglar group name Thuggee,

1063
00:56:51,708 --> 00:56:53,792
were disguising like
traders and soldiers,

1064
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,833
and killing the
travelers looting them.

1065
00:56:57,167 --> 00:56:58,208
During the Investigation,

1066
00:56:58,458 --> 00:57:01,542
they dug out thousands of
dead bodies buried by them.

1067
00:57:04,042 --> 00:57:05,458
For about 450 years,

1068
00:57:05,625 --> 00:57:07,083
with the help of of few rulers.

1069
00:57:07,333 --> 00:57:10,042
They came to know the death
toll was more than 2 million.

1070
00:57:10,208 --> 00:57:11,792
Shocked from this knowledge,

1071
00:57:11,833 --> 00:57:12,958
sent their troops,

1072
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,375
and took extreme measures.

1073
00:57:14,375 --> 00:57:16,375
Hung 100's of Thuggee's to death.

1074
00:57:16,417 --> 00:57:18,208
And put 1000's of
them in the prison.

1075
00:57:18,292 --> 00:57:19,750
Gave them strenuous sentences.

1076
00:57:19,833 --> 00:57:21,708
Also burnt the jungles
they were hiding in.

1077
00:57:21,750 --> 00:57:23,042
And demolished the
clan of Thuggees.

1078
00:57:26,458 --> 00:57:28,750
British Govt., listed these
incidents as an excuse,

1079
00:57:28,792 --> 00:57:30,292
stated Indians are cannibals.

1080
00:57:30,375 --> 00:57:31,708
They can't rule.

1081
00:57:31,833 --> 00:57:34,292
We're the right people
to rule over you guys.

1082
00:57:34,333 --> 00:57:35,375
Across India,

1083
00:57:35,458 --> 00:57:38,000
sorted 230 caste as criminals,

1084
00:57:38,042 --> 00:57:39,417
and branded them as
Hereditary Criminals.

1085
00:57:39,458 --> 00:57:42,167
In this thousands
of innocent lives,

1086
00:57:42,208 --> 00:57:43,667
were affected by British officials.

1087
00:57:43,750 --> 00:57:44,792
After Independence,

1088
00:57:44,792 --> 00:57:45,958
during Pandit Nehru's Govt.,

1089
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,750
revoked the rule of
Hereditary Criminals.

1090
00:57:47,792 --> 00:57:50,083
And helped the families
of the affected.

1091
00:57:50,583 --> 00:57:51,792
Grateful people,

1092
00:57:51,792 --> 00:57:54,458
lead calm and peaceful
life making their living.

1093
00:57:55,083 --> 00:57:56,208
Except for the few.

1094
00:57:56,333 --> 00:57:57,208
POORTHI'S!

1095
00:57:58,458 --> 00:57:59,458
KERAVAS!

1096
00:58:00,542 --> 00:58:01,542
SANSI'S!

1097
00:58:02,625 --> 00:58:03,625
SANJAR BHATS!

1098
00:58:04,708 --> 00:58:05,750
BINGOLOS!

1099
00:58:06,750 --> 00:58:07,792
HAWARIAS!

1100
00:58:07,958 --> 00:58:09,333
Few among them,

1101
00:58:09,375 --> 00:58:11,625
don't even realize what
they're doing is a crime.

1102
00:58:11,667 --> 00:58:14,083
Poorthis, had migrated
from Maharashtra,

1103
00:58:14,125 --> 00:58:15,833
and are living in many
parts across India.

1104
00:58:15,875 --> 00:58:16,750
Keravas;

1105
00:58:16,875 --> 00:58:18,292
migrated from Tiruvanamalai,

1106
00:58:18,375 --> 00:58:21,833
and are in Chandrapur(Maharashtra), also
they're in Urapakkam and Guduvanchery.

1107
00:58:22,333 --> 00:58:23,208
Bingolos;

1108
00:58:23,250 --> 00:58:24,875
they enter through Bangladesh,

1109
00:58:24,875 --> 00:58:26,458
and commit crimes
in outer Delhi.

1110
00:58:26,833 --> 00:58:27,750
Hawarias;

1111
00:58:27,833 --> 00:58:29,583
they're in UP and Noida.

1112
00:58:29,958 --> 00:58:32,542
It should be one of them,
who would have done this.

1113
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,917
Hunting being their profession.

1114
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,667
the technique used
in killing animals,

1115
00:58:37,750 --> 00:58:39,375
is used for killing humans too.

1116
00:58:46,375 --> 00:58:47,833
Do something and catch them.

1117
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,958
Stations, Courts and
Prisons across India,

1118
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,875
we'll have to look there
for their fingerprints.

1119
00:58:51,917 --> 00:58:53,042
Do that right away.

1120
00:58:54,458 --> 00:58:55,833
IGP North Zone,

1121
00:58:55,833 --> 00:58:57,750
under Vijay Rathore's order a
special team has been formed.

1122
00:58:57,792 --> 00:58:59,750
Why was that not in
place, all these years!?

1123
00:58:59,792 --> 00:59:00,958
The burglars will
be caught soon.

1124
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,667
Sir one more question, sir.
...sir, sir!

1125
00:59:02,708 --> 00:59:03,625
Long live Democracy!

1126
00:59:03,625 --> 00:59:06,292
-Sir, Sir.
-Last question sir.

1127
00:59:22,667 --> 00:59:26,125
-Nothing seems to be in order
-Can't understand the writing...

1128
00:59:28,583 --> 00:59:29,583
-Not Identical.
-Not Identical.

1129
00:59:29,583 --> 00:59:30,583
-Not Identical.
-Not Identical.

1130
00:59:30,583 --> 00:59:32,125
We've searched the
entire Andhra Pradesh,

1131
00:59:32,125 --> 00:59:33,125
no match.

1132
00:59:34,750 --> 00:59:35,542
Not Identical.

1133
00:59:37,917 --> 00:59:38,792
Not Identical.

1134
00:59:39,292 --> 00:59:40,042
Not Identical.

1135
00:59:40,083 --> 00:59:40,833
Not Identical.

1136
00:59:40,875 --> 00:59:42,583
Couldn't find anything
in Karnataka too.

1137
00:59:43,917 --> 00:59:45,583
That's it, no more files.

1138
00:59:45,667 --> 00:59:47,167
-no match.
-Not identical.

1139
00:59:47,875 --> 00:59:49,667
The documents up North
are not in order,

1140
00:59:49,667 --> 00:59:51,208
we're not leaving
anything to chance.

1141
00:59:52,458 --> 00:59:53,708
Those are the only files,

1142
00:59:53,708 --> 00:59:54,750
please get out from here.

1143
00:59:54,792 --> 00:59:56,333
No match found Sir.

1144
00:59:59,333 --> 00:59:59,875
Sir!

1145
01:00:00,250 --> 01:00:01,417
Nothing in Orissa too.

1146
01:00:01,667 --> 01:00:02,958
Next we're heading
to Madhya Pradesh.

1147
01:00:09,792 --> 01:00:11,208
Couldn't find anything
in Madhya Pradesh too.

1148
01:00:13,292 --> 01:00:15,583
These are all the files,
nothing more to it.

1149
01:00:15,708 --> 01:00:16,708
We've searched completely.

1150
01:00:16,917 --> 01:00:17,917
No match found.

1151
01:00:18,625 --> 01:00:21,167
I'm losing hope on getting
the fingerprints.

1152
01:00:23,167 --> 01:00:24,750
Jai Hind Sir! please come.

1153
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,375
West Bengal was a no go too.

1154
01:00:30,375 --> 01:00:31,125
No match found.

1155
01:00:31,125 --> 01:00:31,833
No match found.

1156
01:00:31,833 --> 01:00:32,458
No match found.

1157
01:00:32,458 --> 01:00:33,125
No match found.

1158
01:00:33,167 --> 01:00:33,792
No match found.

1159
01:00:33,792 --> 01:00:34,458
No match found.

1160
01:00:34,542 --> 01:00:35,208
No match found.

1161
01:00:35,250 --> 01:00:35,958
No match found.

1162
01:00:39,333 --> 01:00:40,083
-Hello Sir.
-Jai Hind Sir.

1163
01:00:40,083 --> 01:00:41,458
From Tamilnadu Police,
are the files ready?

1164
01:00:47,917 --> 01:00:48,792
Sir!

1165
01:00:49,042 --> 01:00:50,042
No match found.

1166
01:00:51,125 --> 01:00:53,125
Could've let me know we
were coming this far,

1167
01:00:53,375 --> 01:00:56,250
you asked me to pack light,
and got me here in a van.

1168
01:00:56,375 --> 01:00:57,875
I'm dying of cold.

1169
01:00:57,917 --> 01:00:59,792
Sir, please adjust and keep
looking, I'll be back.

1170
01:01:00,208 --> 01:01:01,458
They're gone...

1171
01:01:01,750 --> 01:01:03,375
They'll only return
in the evening.

1172
01:01:03,375 --> 01:01:04,958
Sit down, please sit
down photographer.

1173
01:01:04,958 --> 01:01:07,458
They're not even letting me
celebrate Pongal Festival.

1174
01:01:08,958 --> 01:01:09,667
Snake.

1175
01:01:10,167 --> 01:01:10,958
Snake.

1176
01:01:11,583 --> 01:01:12,292
Snake.

1177
01:01:12,375 --> 01:01:13,375
What's it Sir?

1178
01:01:13,458 --> 01:01:14,708
You've been ranting, Snake?

1179
01:01:14,750 --> 01:01:15,792
Photographer,

1180
01:01:15,917 --> 01:01:17,208
every strand of fingerprint,

1181
01:01:17,250 --> 01:01:19,875
has been imprinted on to mind
like a parrot and a scorpion.

1182
01:01:19,917 --> 01:01:22,125
The one we're looking
for now is a Snake.

1183
01:01:22,208 --> 01:01:23,542
A Black Cobra.

1184
01:01:29,333 --> 01:01:30,542
Now in UP,

1185
01:01:30,583 --> 01:01:31,583
Meerut and Agra.

1186
01:01:31,708 --> 01:01:33,125
Only those two prisons
are left to check.

1187
01:01:33,125 --> 01:01:36,333
I'm going there tomorrow, if nothing
is there too wondering what to do?

1188
01:01:45,292 --> 01:01:47,250
Not possible, can't
let you guys in.

1189
01:01:47,375 --> 01:01:49,792
It's 5:30pm and we're in the process
of releasing prisoners on bail.

1190
01:01:49,833 --> 01:01:51,667
We'll bring down the flag at
6pm and closed the gates.

1191
01:01:51,708 --> 01:01:52,917
-We're coming from Chennai
-Come again tomorrow

1192
01:01:52,917 --> 01:01:55,792
-We've been searching them for 10 years
-Please understand come tomorrow.

1193
01:01:56,125 --> 01:01:57,000
-Please help us sir.
-Salim!?

1194
01:01:57,417 --> 01:01:58,083
Jai Hind Sir!

1195
01:01:58,125 --> 01:01:58,792
Good evening sir.

1196
01:01:58,833 --> 01:01:59,667
What is the issue here?

1197
01:01:59,708 --> 01:02:01,292
They've come in search
of fingerprints.

1198
01:02:01,375 --> 01:02:03,250
What are you going to do
with the fingerprints?

1199
01:02:05,083 --> 01:02:06,375
It's surprising!

1200
01:02:06,458 --> 01:02:08,500
You've come all the way
with the fingerprints.

1201
01:02:09,083 --> 01:02:11,042
It's 5:45pm...

1202
01:02:11,083 --> 01:02:11,500
...Sir!

1203
01:02:11,708 --> 01:02:13,208
I just need the exit gate ledger.

1204
01:02:13,250 --> 01:02:14,042
Please sir.

1205
01:02:14,083 --> 01:02:15,083
Sir, please.

1206
01:02:15,250 --> 01:02:16,625
Please Sir, Please Sir.

1207
01:02:16,792 --> 01:02:17,958
-Please Sir.
-Let them in.

1208
01:02:18,125 --> 01:02:19,875
-Ok Sir!
-Thank you Sir.

1209
01:02:21,625 --> 01:02:23,125
Come along Sir, come along.

1210
01:03:08,667 --> 01:03:10,333
That's great brother, you rock.

1211
01:03:10,375 --> 01:03:11,292
You're awesome.

1212
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,250
-Hello Sathya.
-Sir, Sir!

1213
01:03:16,625 --> 01:03:17,792
We got one match, Sir.

1214
01:03:17,833 --> 01:03:18,750
That's great Sathya.

1215
01:03:18,792 --> 01:03:20,500
It's a perfect 8 point match.

1216
01:03:20,625 --> 01:03:21,875
Yes, Yes, Yes!

1217
01:03:21,875 --> 01:03:22,625
His name is Banne Singh,

1218
01:03:22,667 --> 01:03:24,208
we were lucky as he was
convicted for a petty case.

1219
01:03:24,250 --> 01:03:25,708
He's from Rajasthan's
Hawaria Gang.

1220
01:03:27,375 --> 01:03:29,167
Secure the fingerprint
specialist.

1221
01:03:29,208 --> 01:03:30,333
He shouldn't speak to anyone.

1222
01:03:30,375 --> 01:03:32,125
Until the news reaches CM's
office and is re-confirmed,

1223
01:03:32,125 --> 01:03:33,625
this news shouldn't
get out to the press.

1224
01:03:33,625 --> 01:03:34,750
You leave to Rajasthan
immediately.

1225
01:03:34,792 --> 01:03:36,083
-I'll tomorrow...
-Sir, a small request.

1226
01:03:36,333 --> 01:03:36,792
Huh?

1227
01:03:36,792 --> 01:03:39,792
It's been long since I went
home, had food or slept.

1228
01:03:39,875 --> 01:03:41,208
I feel like seeing my kid.

1229
01:03:41,208 --> 01:03:43,042
Only if we lose our
sleep and happiness,

1230
01:03:43,125 --> 01:03:43,750
public can sleep peacefully.

1231
01:03:43,792 --> 01:03:44,833
Sorry Sir.

1232
01:03:44,917 --> 01:03:46,042
It's ok Sathya, good job.

1233
01:03:46,083 --> 01:03:46,792
Thanks Sir.

1234
01:03:46,875 --> 01:03:48,375
Once I get to Rajasthan,
will relieve you.

1235
01:03:48,500 --> 01:03:50,417
Until then, I'll send a lady
constable as security to your house.

1236
01:03:50,500 --> 01:03:51,042
Ok!?

1237
01:03:51,167 --> 01:03:52,250
-Thanks Sir
-Good job, Good job.

1238
01:03:52,292 --> 01:03:53,042
Ok Sir.

1239
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:55,250
Dear...Dear!

1240
01:03:55,292 --> 01:03:57,125
What happened, why
are you so excited?

1241
01:03:57,167 --> 01:03:58,167
Tell me why?

1242
01:04:00,292 --> 01:04:00,958
Rathore here,

1243
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:01,500
Sir!

1244
01:04:01,625 --> 01:04:02,500
Congrats Theeran.

1245
01:04:02,500 --> 01:04:03,667
-Thank you Sir.
-What next?

1246
01:04:03,708 --> 01:04:06,333
We have to fax an official letter
to Rajasthan to support our team.

1247
01:04:11,292 --> 01:04:12,875
-He will help you.
-Thanks Sir.

1248
01:04:13,458 --> 01:04:14,042
Sir!

1249
01:04:14,333 --> 01:04:15,958
Actually the case was is...

1250
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:16,792
Are you a Tamizhan?

1251
01:04:16,792 --> 01:04:17,750
How did you figure that out?

1252
01:04:17,792 --> 01:04:19,333
It reflects from the
way your English is.

1253
01:04:19,333 --> 01:04:21,000
Stay here, I'll
inquire and get back.

1254
01:04:22,833 --> 01:04:24,458
Sir has asked to
keep you isolated.

1255
01:04:24,500 --> 01:04:25,708
You shouldn't speak
to anyone it seems.

1256
01:04:25,750 --> 01:04:26,792
-It's an order from high up.
-Ok Sir.

1257
01:04:26,833 --> 01:04:27,875
-Dear.
-Yes Dear!

1258
01:04:27,875 --> 01:04:28,958
I won't come home tonight.

1259
01:04:29,125 --> 01:04:30,125
I'm heading to Rajasthan.

1260
01:04:30,292 --> 01:04:31,292
Pass on my bag through Porkodi.

1261
01:04:31,417 --> 01:04:33,042
If you leave to Rajasthan,

1262
01:04:33,083 --> 01:04:34,750
then who will I hug and sleep.

1263
01:04:34,875 --> 01:04:36,333
-Hang up, damn it.
-You hang up!

1264
01:04:36,417 --> 01:04:37,417
Hey!

1265
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:39,000
I forgot to mention
something important.

1266
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:39,708
What's it?

1267
01:04:39,708 --> 01:04:40,708
I Love You.

1268
01:04:41,500 --> 01:04:43,167
Don't sass me with your antics.

1269
01:04:43,208 --> 01:04:43,667
BYE!

1270
01:04:44,792 --> 01:04:46,958
I got the picture of the
accused from the record room.

1271
01:04:48,833 --> 01:04:49,583

1272
01:04:50,125 --> 01:04:51,375

1276
01:05:13,292 --> 01:05:14,208

Banne Singh left 5 days back with a
load for Maambakkam Glass Company.

1281
01:05:27,708 --> 01:05:29,167
He might be in Chennai now.

1282
01:05:29,708 --> 01:05:30,417

If possible arrest

01:06:55,417 --> 01:06:56,083
Not him.

1312
01:06:56,167 --> 01:06:57,042
Not him.

Get a hold of him,
don't let go off him,

1321
01:07:12,167 --> 01:07:14,792
Kabbadi...Kabbadi!

1322
01:08:12,458 --> 01:08:14,583
Looks like the time is good.

1323
01:08:14,583 --> 01:08:16,958
Hoping for a great hunt today.

1324
01:08:20,292 --> 01:08:21,375
Are there any more trucks?

1325
01:08:21,583 --> 01:08:23,667
Many trucks parked outside too,
you can check there as well.

1326
01:08:26,917 --> 01:08:27,958
Hey come here.

1327
01:08:28,583 --> 01:08:29,500
Tell me Sir.

1328
01:08:29,833 --> 01:08:30,958
Have you seen him?

1329
01:08:31,375 --> 01:08:32,292
I've seen him.

1330
01:08:32,375 --> 01:08:34,000
The truck he came in
is parked out there.

1331
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:35,042
-Is that so?
-Yes I'll take you there.

1332
01:08:35,083 --> 01:08:36,208
Show me where's it.

1333
01:08:37,083 --> 01:08:37,625
Hey!

1334
01:08:37,708 --> 01:08:38,750
-Where's the truck?
-It was right here.

1335
01:08:38,792 --> 01:08:39,792
Where exactly did you see it?

1336
01:08:40,917 --> 01:08:43,292
Brother, the truck parked
here, where did it go?

1337
01:08:43,292 --> 01:08:46,125
It left an hour back,
would’ve crossed Red Hills.

1338
01:08:53,917 --> 01:08:55,375
Sir, It's Durai here.

1339
01:08:55,375 --> 01:08:56,625
It's been an hour
since the truck left.

1340
01:08:56,667 --> 01:08:57,917
They're saying might've
crossed Red Hills by now.

1341
01:08:57,917 --> 01:08:59,375
There were 5-6 of
them in the truck.

1342
01:09:02,875 --> 01:09:04,750
Control Room;
DSP Theeran here.

1343
01:09:04,792 --> 01:09:07,500
MLA case accused truck is
heading towards Red Hills.

1344
01:09:07,500 --> 01:09:11,000
Get the picture from DSP's office, share it
with all the stations across the highway.

1345
01:09:11,083 --> 01:09:12,917
Barricade the roads, and check
every truck thoroughly.

1346
01:09:23,833 --> 01:09:25,125
Has the picture
reached Control room?

1347
01:09:25,167 --> 01:09:26,500
Ask all the stations
on high alert.

1348
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:28,292
The truck shouldn't go
beyond Tamilnadu border.

1349
01:09:32,042 --> 01:09:32,667
Ok...Ok!

1350
01:09:32,708 --> 01:09:33,625
Don't spare any truck,

1351
01:09:33,625 --> 01:09:34,958
Check if it has
Rajasthan's license plate.

1352
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:36,208
-Come sooner.
-Check them properly.

1353
01:09:36,250 --> 01:09:38,208
Check if it's the guy in the Fax.

1354
01:09:38,250 --> 01:09:39,167
Don't spare anyone,

1355
01:09:39,208 --> 01:09:40,500
I've been checking
them for an hour,

1356
01:09:40,500 --> 01:09:43,000
no truck with Rajasthan
license plate came through.

1357
01:09:45,250 --> 01:09:47,083
Hey leave, leave from here.

1358
01:09:47,167 --> 01:09:49,667
Let the cars go, check all the
truck and their license plates.

1359
01:09:49,667 --> 01:09:50,458
Quick!

1360
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,083
Keep coming, move quickly.

1361
01:09:53,125 --> 01:09:55,708
-Check the cars too,
-Let the cars go...

1362
01:09:55,958 --> 01:09:57,333
Sir, let the cars go.

1363
01:09:57,375 --> 01:09:59,125
Did the Rajasthan truck pass by?

1364
01:09:59,125 --> 01:09:59,833
No Sir.

1365
01:09:59,833 --> 01:10:00,917
Leave, you can leave.

1366
01:10:00,917 --> 01:10:02,583
Ask that vehicle
to move forward.

1367
01:10:02,625 --> 01:10:05,375
I'm heading towards Red Hills,
update me if you get anything.

1368
01:10:05,375 --> 01:10:08,042
We've been checking every truck, once
we have something will inform you.

1369
01:10:27,250 --> 01:10:28,417
Get down, quick.

1370
01:10:42,833 --> 01:10:43,625
Move!

1371
01:10:55,083 --> 01:10:56,375
Sir, open the door.

1372
01:10:56,375 --> 01:10:57,792
Our vehicle met with an
accident due to rain.

1373
01:10:57,833 --> 01:10:59,125
We need to call an ambulance.

1374
01:10:59,167 --> 01:11:00,667
-Who's that?
-Please open the door.

1375
01:11:00,708 --> 01:11:02,125
Job should be completed
in five minutes.

1376
01:11:02,167 --> 01:11:03,417
Oh no, it's those Dacoits.

1377
01:11:10,125 --> 01:11:12,083
Who's been knocking
so hard on the door.

1378
01:11:12,500 --> 01:11:14,000
What's the noise there?

1379
01:11:14,042 --> 01:11:14,750
Who's that?

1380
01:11:14,792 --> 01:11:15,500
What happened Selvi?

1381
01:11:15,583 --> 01:11:17,250
Leave from here,
it's those Dacoits.

1382
01:11:17,625 --> 01:11:18,083
Leave!

1383
01:11:18,083 --> 01:11:20,875
Oh god, how are we going
to handle without Sathya.

1384
01:11:26,375 --> 01:11:28,125
Priya give the phone to brother.

1385
01:11:28,167 --> 01:11:29,708
He left for Rajasthan.

1386
01:11:29,792 --> 01:11:30,917
Oh God!

1387
01:11:31,042 --> 01:11:31,708
Sister!?

1388
01:11:32,875 --> 01:11:35,250
-Hello...Sister!?
-Don't know what to do.

1389
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:36,500
Porkodi!

1390
01:11:36,583 --> 01:11:37,708
-Come on quick,
-Where are we going at this hour?

1391
01:11:37,708 --> 01:11:39,875
No idea what happened,
Sister called...

1392
01:11:39,917 --> 01:11:41,000
...she was crying on the phone
and it got disconnected.

1393
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:42,708
Moreover brother Sathya isn't
here, let's go and check.

1394
01:11:43,417 --> 01:11:44,125
Dad...

1395
01:11:44,167 --> 01:11:46,000
...take your daughter and
leave through the back exit.

1396
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:48,208
Leave!

1397
01:11:57,833 --> 01:11:59,417
-Mother come soon.
-You manage to escape.

1398
01:11:59,417 --> 01:12:01,333
You runaway to Priya's house.

1399
01:12:01,500 --> 01:12:02,333
Runaway dear.

1400
01:12:02,333 --> 01:12:03,625
Big Lion!

1401
01:12:04,292 --> 01:12:05,500
Big Lion.

1402
01:12:06,500 --> 01:12:07,500
Big Lion!

1403
01:12:08,208 --> 01:12:09,583
They've broke down the door.

1404
01:12:09,625 --> 01:12:11,167
You leave too sir.

1405
01:12:11,208 --> 01:12:13,000
Oh no, sir you please leave.

1406
01:12:14,292 --> 01:12:16,583
If you don't, I'll get a
earful from the department.

1407
01:12:16,625 --> 01:12:17,792
You please leave.

1408
01:12:22,500 --> 01:12:23,375
Stop!

1409
01:12:23,708 --> 01:12:24,292
Sir!

1410
01:12:24,375 --> 01:12:26,500
We heard a gun shot near
Kommakkambedu forest,

1411
01:12:26,500 --> 01:12:27,417
go there immediately.

1412
01:12:27,500 --> 01:12:29,250
I'll be there in 10
minutes, I'm 5 kms away.

1413
01:12:29,292 --> 01:12:30,458
Ok Sir, we're heading there.

1414
01:12:44,125 --> 01:12:45,250
They're running away
with the Jewels.

1415
01:12:45,250 --> 01:12:46,292
I'll take care of her.

1416
01:12:46,500 --> 01:12:48,083
Take the child and runaway.

1417
01:12:49,083 --> 01:12:50,500
Somehow manage to escape.

1418
01:13:13,250 --> 01:13:13,917
Sister!

1419
01:13:13,917 --> 01:13:15,333
Ma'am please don't get
in to the forest alone.

1420
01:13:15,333 --> 01:13:16,458
Please listen to me Ma'am.

1421
01:13:17,042 --> 01:13:18,042
Sister!

1422
01:13:19,625 --> 01:13:21,417
-You check on the house.
-Let's call the police station.

1423
01:13:21,417 --> 01:13:22,875
Just do as I say.

1424
01:13:22,917 --> 01:13:24,292
I can hear the child crying.

1425
01:13:24,292 --> 01:13:25,167
Sister!

1426
01:13:29,292 --> 01:13:31,000
Big Lion.

1427
01:13:32,833 --> 01:13:33,833
Sister!

1428
01:13:33,917 --> 01:13:35,333
Small Lion!?

1429
01:13:35,667 --> 01:13:37,042
Sir, there's a
truck parked here.

1430
01:13:37,083 --> 01:13:38,250
Check the license plate.

1431
01:13:38,292 --> 01:13:39,583
Is it Rajasthan registration?

1432
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:41,708
Sir, it is Rajasthan
license plate.

1433
01:13:41,750 --> 01:13:42,750
Who's inside the truck?

1434
01:13:42,750 --> 01:13:43,667
Check on the other side.

1435
01:13:43,750 --> 01:13:44,167
Hey!

1436
01:13:45,042 --> 01:13:46,000
They're shooting at us.

1437
01:13:46,083 --> 01:13:47,958
Get in to the car,
come on drive.

1438
01:13:48,083 --> 01:13:49,333
Don't let them escape, chase.

1439
01:14:00,292 --> 01:14:01,667
Police have captured the truck,

1440
01:14:01,667 --> 01:14:03,208
-Let's leave...
-Bloody ****** Police!

1441
01:14:03,292 --> 01:14:04,708
Run quick, come on quicker.

1442
01:14:04,750 --> 01:14:05,667
Faster!

1443
01:14:05,875 --> 01:14:06,708
Stop the vehicle.

1444
01:14:06,750 --> 01:14:08,667
They went in to Inspector Sathya's
house, don't let them evade.

1445
01:14:08,708 --> 01:14:10,583
Chase and catch them,
come on quick.

1446
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:12,125
Hello Control Room.

1447
01:14:12,167 --> 01:14:13,917
Accused have entered
Inspector Sathya's house.

1448
01:14:13,917 --> 01:14:14,917
Inform DSP about it.

1449
01:14:14,958 --> 01:14:16,875
Sathya is not in town, nothing
should happen to his family.

1450
01:14:16,875 --> 01:14:19,000
I'm on my way there, call
for back-up immediately.

1451
01:14:26,583 --> 01:14:28,292
They ran in to the forest behind.

1452
01:14:28,333 --> 01:14:29,333
Chase them!

1453
01:15:01,250 --> 01:15:02,667
Split up and look for them.

1454
01:15:02,708 --> 01:15:04,208
-Ok Sir.
-Ok Sir!

1455
01:15:14,792 --> 01:15:15,667
Karna!?

1456
01:15:21,750 --> 01:15:22,667
Seva!

1457
01:15:23,083 --> 01:15:23,917
Seva!?

1458
01:15:25,917 --> 01:15:26,625
Hey!

1459
01:15:27,667 --> 01:15:28,458
Seva!

1460
01:15:29,042 --> 01:15:29,792
Hey!

1461
01:15:30,833 --> 01:15:31,667
Seva!

1462
01:15:33,792 --> 01:15:34,625
Seva!

1463
01:15:41,708 --> 01:15:42,583
Neilson!

1464
01:15:43,500 --> 01:15:44,500
Neilson!

1465
01:15:44,667 --> 01:15:45,667
Neilson!

1466
01:15:56,500 --> 01:15:58,208
Sir there's a guy here.

1467
01:15:59,875 --> 01:16:00,583
Hey!

1468
01:16:25,500 --> 01:16:26,375
Hello control Room.

1469
01:16:26,417 --> 01:16:29,250
DSP's wife Priya ran in to the
forest in spite of me stopping her.

1470
01:16:29,292 --> 01:16:29,875
Priya.

1471
01:16:30,625 --> 01:16:31,625
Sister!

1472
01:16:32,667 --> 01:16:33,667
Sister.

1473
01:16:34,875 --> 01:16:36,833
Big Lion!

1474
01:16:37,083 --> 01:16:38,500
Big Lion.

1475
01:16:39,208 --> 01:16:40,875
Where's Mom? where's she?

1476
01:16:40,875 --> 01:16:41,458
Huh!?

1477
01:16:42,375 --> 01:16:43,333
What happened?

1478
01:16:48,875 --> 01:16:50,667
SIR!

1479
01:16:50,833 --> 01:16:52,583
They've escaped in to the forest.

1480
01:16:52,625 --> 01:16:53,958
Our men have gone too
looking for them.

1481
01:16:53,958 --> 01:16:55,917
Send a Patrol immediately to
other side of the forest.

1482
01:16:55,958 --> 01:16:57,583
Call for an ambulance
right away.

1483
01:17:03,667 --> 01:17:04,667
Get behind me.

1484
01:17:25,500 --> 01:17:26,375
Ruby.

1485
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:28,875
Ruby!

1486
01:17:29,292 --> 01:17:31,500
Looking at this I'm scared what
would've happened to Ma'am.

1487
01:17:31,583 --> 01:17:32,833
-Give me the gun.
-Here it is, Sir.

1488
01:17:32,875 --> 01:17:34,750
-Which way did they go?
-That way.

1489
01:18:00,167 --> 01:18:01,000
Priya!

1490
01:18:03,958 --> 01:18:04,958
Ruby attack!

1491
01:18:06,292 --> 01:18:07,292
Small Lion.

1492
01:18:10,125 --> 01:18:12,125
Poor thing, he's drenched
in rain, stop the vehicle.

1493
01:18:14,875 --> 01:18:15,875
Come on, let's go quick.

1494
01:18:15,875 --> 01:18:16,917
-Quick!
-Faster, Faster.

1495
01:18:16,958 --> 01:18:18,292
Police is right behind us.

1496
01:18:18,333 --> 01:18:19,167
Faster!

1497
01:18:19,417 --> 01:18:20,500
Drive faster.

1498
01:18:32,458 --> 01:18:35,208
Ambulance will be here
anytime, shift everyone there.

1499
01:18:35,375 --> 01:18:36,417
Priya!?

1500
01:18:38,417 --> 01:18:39,083
Don't cry.

1501
01:18:41,042 --> 01:18:42,042
Don't cry.

1502
01:18:42,375 --> 01:18:43,375
Don't get scared.

1503
01:18:45,792 --> 01:18:47,708
I'm calling the Police now.

1504
01:19:03,042 --> 01:19:04,042
Priya!

1505
01:19:04,333 --> 01:19:05,250
Priya!

1506
01:19:14,042 --> 01:19:16,167
Give me the Jewels, if not...

1507
01:19:16,250 --> 01:19:17,500
Priya!

1508
01:19:19,625 --> 01:19:20,792
Priya!

1509
01:19:51,125 --> 01:19:53,083
Get up, big lion.

1510
01:19:53,750 --> 01:19:54,750
Priya!

1511
01:19:57,083 --> 01:19:57,792
Priya!

1512
01:19:57,833 --> 01:19:59,292
Uncle!

1513
01:19:59,625 --> 01:20:00,208
Priya!

1514
01:20:00,292 --> 01:20:01,167
Priya!

1515
01:20:02,417 --> 01:20:04,125
-Priya!
-Uncle.

1516
01:20:04,167 --> 01:20:04,917
Priya!

1517
01:20:05,917 --> 01:20:06,625
Priya!

1518
01:20:07,417 --> 01:20:08,167
Priya!

1519
01:20:08,792 --> 01:20:09,667
Priya!

1520
01:20:10,167 --> 01:20:11,042
Priya!

1521
01:20:13,292 --> 01:20:14,292
Priya!

1522
01:20:22,583 --> 01:20:23,625
Late last night,

1523
01:20:23,667 --> 01:20:27,042
in order to catch the burglars involved
in MLA Sugavanam's murder case,

1524
01:20:27,167 --> 01:20:28,875
the operation led by
DSP Theeran failed.

1525
01:20:28,917 --> 01:20:30,792
In spite informing Andhra
Police, they escaped.

1526
01:20:30,833 --> 01:20:32,542
Inspector Sathya's
wife and family,

1527
01:20:32,583 --> 01:20:34,708
were killed by that
gang of burglars.

1528
01:21:03,708 --> 01:21:06,125
I feel like harming myself.

1529
01:21:06,375 --> 01:21:08,542
All thoughts at this
moment will be dangerous.

1530
01:21:10,708 --> 01:21:11,958
You have a child
to take care of,

1531
01:21:12,250 --> 01:21:12,833
Sir!

1532
01:21:13,083 --> 01:21:14,292
Doctor is calling for you.

1533
01:21:15,292 --> 01:21:16,792
Priya is in coma.

1534
01:21:17,292 --> 01:21:19,875
Surgery is done for the
wound on the head.

1535
01:21:20,333 --> 01:21:21,958
-But...
-Will she get better, Doctor?

1536
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:22,833
Let's believe that.

1537
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:24,167
Should regain consciousness.

1538
01:21:24,167 --> 01:21:25,375
It might happen tomorrow.

1539
01:21:25,542 --> 01:21:26,917
Might even take 4 years.

1540
01:21:27,208 --> 01:21:28,292
-Might not even...
-Doctor!?

1541
01:21:28,458 --> 01:21:29,958
I'm not trying to scare you,

1542
01:21:29,958 --> 01:21:31,042
It's a fact.

1543
01:21:31,167 --> 01:21:32,583
She's under observation.

1544
01:21:32,875 --> 01:21:35,292
And, she also got aborted.

1545
01:21:38,292 --> 01:21:39,167
Dear!

1546
01:21:40,750 --> 01:21:42,667
In eight months,

1547
01:21:42,958 --> 01:21:45,750
there will be a baby
just like me at home.

1548
01:21:47,042 --> 01:21:48,875
Then for 3 months,

1549
01:21:49,042 --> 01:21:53,042
she will be blinking,
sleeping and watching us.

1550
01:21:55,292 --> 01:21:57,458
During the 4th month,
she will roll over.

1551
01:21:58,292 --> 01:22:02,042
After which she'll stand,
walk and will start to play,

1552
01:22:02,833 --> 01:22:05,667
will call me "Mom"
for the first time.

1553
01:22:06,542 --> 01:22:07,458
Her first words will be "Dad".

1554
01:22:09,708 --> 01:22:11,292
-It'll be Mom.
-It'll be Dad.

1555
01:22:12,625 --> 01:22:14,250
-It'll be Mom.
-It'll be Dad.

1556
01:22:15,083 --> 01:22:17,958
-It'll be Mom, Mom, Mom...
-Ok, Ok.

1557
01:22:35,458 --> 01:22:36,542
-Theeran.
-Sir!

1558
01:22:36,667 --> 01:22:38,708
I'm relieving you both
from the operation.

1559
01:22:38,792 --> 01:22:39,458
Sir!

1560
01:22:40,208 --> 01:22:42,125
It's vital for us to
be in this operation.

1561
01:22:45,625 --> 01:22:47,292
Don't take hasty
decisions in anger.

1562
01:22:47,375 --> 01:22:49,167
I'm saying this 'cause there's
too much personal loss involved.

1563
01:22:49,458 --> 01:22:50,208
No Sir.

1564
01:22:51,292 --> 01:22:52,083
When I was 5,

1565
01:22:52,542 --> 01:22:55,250
my Dad who went out to get
chocolate wearing his uniform,

1566
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:57,000
never returned.

1567
01:22:58,500 --> 01:23:01,042
My mother never let me realize
that as a personal loss.

1568
01:23:02,250 --> 01:23:04,250
Not everyone is lucky to lose
life in the line of duty.

1569
01:23:04,542 --> 01:23:06,708
She raised me keeping
my Dad as an example.

1570
01:23:07,875 --> 01:23:08,708
Till date,

1571
01:23:08,833 --> 01:23:10,708
I can proudly say,
that I'm his son.

1572
01:23:11,833 --> 01:23:13,708
It should be the case
with my children too.

1573
01:23:15,208 --> 01:23:16,833
It's not anger nor a revenge.

1574
01:23:17,750 --> 01:23:19,125
If we get off this case,

1575
01:23:19,333 --> 01:23:20,333
we both...

1576
01:23:20,875 --> 01:23:23,917
...will regret entire life that we
didn't perform our duties well.

1577
01:23:26,083 --> 01:23:26,750
Proceed.

1578
01:23:27,375 --> 01:23:28,375
PULL!

1579
01:23:33,792 --> 01:23:35,292
If there are more than
three in the cabin,

1580
01:23:35,333 --> 01:23:36,458
Police might check...

1581
01:23:36,458 --> 01:23:40,042
...so they set up a secret room behind
truck in pretense to an actual one.

1582
01:23:40,208 --> 01:23:43,500
As they park the truck a
kilometer away from the spot,

1583
01:23:43,625 --> 01:23:45,500
we never got the
tire-marks of the truck.

1584
01:23:45,792 --> 01:23:47,208
They fixed a dummy diesel tank,

1585
01:23:47,250 --> 01:23:48,792
in which they hid weapons.

1586
01:23:48,833 --> 01:23:50,667
It was all meticulously planned.

1587
01:23:51,458 --> 01:23:54,208
Pick young and righteous
team to go up North.

1588
01:23:54,375 --> 01:23:56,583
Seniors will laze around
without investigating,

1589
01:23:56,708 --> 01:23:58,625
and will lie stating, they
did go but no one was there.

1590
01:23:58,708 --> 01:23:59,542
Nazeer Sir!

1591
01:23:59,542 --> 01:24:01,292
Pick him, he can
speak Hindi well.

1592
01:24:08,708 --> 01:24:10,792
We've divided you guys
in to 8 Crime parties.

1593
01:24:11,167 --> 01:24:13,333
Every Crime Party will have
a fingerprint specialist,

1594
01:24:13,625 --> 01:24:15,375
and one who can speak
Hindi will be present.

1595
01:24:16,125 --> 01:24:18,042
Will we get good food up north?

1596
01:24:18,083 --> 01:24:19,083
will we get sleep?

1597
01:24:19,292 --> 01:24:22,250
we don't know if we can speak
to our family wives or kids.

1598
01:24:23,042 --> 01:24:25,458
But make sure not to spare
no one from that gang.

1599
01:24:25,583 --> 01:24:27,250
There shouldn't
be another theft,

1600
01:24:27,292 --> 01:24:29,208
or loss of an innocent
life due to this gang.

1601
01:24:30,042 --> 01:24:32,792
No criminal should even think
of coming to Tamilnadu anymore.

1602
01:24:33,167 --> 01:24:34,000
Can we do it!?

1603
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:35,167
Yes Sir!

1604
01:24:35,375 --> 01:24:36,375
Disperse!

1605
01:24:37,667 --> 01:24:40,375
We've allotted Rs.20,000/- per
team for petrol, food and stay.

1606
01:24:40,458 --> 01:24:42,833
Spend wisely, and make
sure to account them.

1607
01:24:53,542 --> 01:24:57,208
We made Tamilnadu Regiment quarters
of Tihar Jail as our main office.

1608
01:24:57,292 --> 01:24:59,625
Each team stayed in
different States.

1609
01:24:59,917 --> 01:25:02,583
I camped in Rajasthan
and started the work.

1610
01:25:07,500 --> 01:25:10,250
First find out from which gang
he's from and who's their leader.

1611
01:25:10,375 --> 01:25:13,625
'Cause there 8-10 Hawaria
gangs active at the moment.

1612
01:25:13,958 --> 01:25:15,125
Ruthless killers.

1613
01:25:15,125 --> 01:25:17,208
They still live like nomads.

1614
01:25:17,250 --> 01:25:18,292
He'll help you.

1615
01:25:18,333 --> 01:25:19,917
I'm Madhu Sir, and
I'm from Tirupathi.

1616
01:25:19,958 --> 01:25:21,542
The village you mentioned
of Banne Singh,

1617
01:25:21,542 --> 01:25:23,667
is a settlement village
outside Bharatpur.

1618
01:25:24,542 --> 01:25:26,542
Inquire and let me know, if
Banne Singh is in the village.

1619
01:25:26,708 --> 01:25:29,333
If we walk in with uniform to
that village won't return.

1620
01:25:29,500 --> 01:25:30,458
They'll kill us.

1621
01:25:30,583 --> 01:25:33,542
We'll compromise with him not
to come to Tamilnadu anymore.

1622
01:25:33,625 --> 01:25:35,250
We can't arrest them.

1623
01:25:35,250 --> 01:25:37,375
Why are you beating
around the bush?

1624
01:25:37,625 --> 01:25:38,208
Sir!?

1625
01:25:38,500 --> 01:25:40,292
We're not here to compromise.

1626
01:25:47,667 --> 01:25:49,708
Dad will be back soon, ok?

1627
01:25:49,750 --> 01:25:50,917
You got to eat well.

1628
01:25:50,958 --> 01:25:51,958
-Greetings Sir.
-Yeah.

1629
01:25:54,583 --> 01:25:55,292
Sir.

1630
01:25:55,917 --> 01:25:57,292
Banne Singh is in the village.

1631
01:25:58,625 --> 01:26:00,500
-Sathya get ready.
-Yes Sir!

1632
01:26:01,167 --> 01:26:02,750
Boys, everyone get
in to the vehicles.

1633
01:26:03,625 --> 01:26:04,250
Sir.

1634
01:26:04,292 --> 01:26:05,833
Don't do anything in haste.

1635
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:07,500
I'll take care of everything.

1636
01:26:07,500 --> 01:26:08,500
Get in the vehicle.

1637
01:26:08,833 --> 01:26:10,042
Should I come too?

1638
01:26:10,250 --> 01:26:11,917
You guys don't listen,
no matter what I say.

1639
01:26:11,958 --> 01:26:12,792
Oh My God!

1640
01:26:56,042 --> 01:26:57,208
-Madhu.
-Ya.

1641
01:26:57,250 --> 01:26:58,250
Just the you come with me.

1642
01:26:58,250 --> 01:27:00,042
You carry on Sir, I'll
be in the vehicle.

1643
01:27:00,167 --> 01:27:01,292
Come on Madhu.

1644
01:27:02,750 --> 01:27:04,125
-Follow Sir.
-Sathya!

1645
01:27:04,167 --> 01:27:05,542
-Sir.
-Get in.

1646
01:27:05,583 --> 01:27:07,125
No matter what happens don't
get out of the vehicle.

1647
01:27:07,500 --> 01:27:08,958
Use the force and
cover the other side.

1648
01:27:09,375 --> 01:27:10,167
Ok Sir.

1649
01:27:10,375 --> 01:27:11,333
Take the vehicle.

1650
01:27:11,375 --> 01:27:13,042
Brother get around the
backside of the village.

1651
01:27:18,083 --> 01:27:19,292
Uncle!

1652
01:27:19,375 --> 01:27:20,250
Hey, hold on.

1653
01:27:20,375 --> 01:27:22,625
Uncle Banne Singh,
Police is here.

1654
01:27:23,500 --> 01:27:26,458
Brother, Police has
come in to the village.

1655
01:27:45,292 --> 01:27:46,000
Hey!

1656
01:27:46,042 --> 01:27:48,042
Don't you know, that Police
can't come in to the village.

1657
01:27:48,167 --> 01:27:49,167
Get out.

1658
01:27:49,208 --> 01:27:50,833
Madhu, asked them to
send Banne Singh.

1659
01:27:51,333 --> 01:27:52,625
Then we'll leave.

1660
01:27:52,708 --> 01:27:53,917
I have nothing to do with it,

1661
01:27:53,958 --> 01:27:55,875
he tricked me in to it, saying
wanted to see around the place.

1662
01:28:06,542 --> 01:28:07,667
HEY!

1663
01:28:31,042 --> 01:28:31,750
HEY!

1664
01:28:54,250 --> 01:28:56,250
You'll be tarnished,
stop there damn it!

1665
01:28:56,292 --> 01:28:58,000
I'm getting the entire village.

1666
01:29:37,167 --> 01:29:38,833
Wait, I'll handle it.

1667
01:29:59,250 --> 01:30:00,667
Sir!

1668
01:30:00,875 --> 01:30:02,500
Let's leave!

1669
01:30:02,833 --> 01:30:04,042
The entire village
is chasing us.

1670
01:30:05,625 --> 01:30:07,708
Oh God!

1671
01:30:16,208 --> 01:30:17,917
Take that bamboo and
fix it in the vehicle.

1672
01:30:19,792 --> 01:30:21,292
Madhu get inside the vehicle.

1673
01:30:52,875 --> 01:30:54,750
Keep Driving!

1674
01:31:39,458 --> 01:31:40,750
They've surrounded us Sir.

1675
01:31:42,167 --> 01:31:43,542
What do we now Sir?

1676
01:31:46,458 --> 01:31:47,708
Sir, they're inside
the Jeep, Sir.

1677
01:31:47,708 --> 01:31:48,542
They're coming to hack us.

1678
01:31:49,750 --> 01:31:50,750
Bash Them!

1679
01:31:50,750 --> 01:31:54,000
LATHI CHARGE!

1680
01:32:24,292 --> 01:32:25,542
Hit them hard.

1681
01:32:25,583 --> 01:32:26,875
Bash them!

1682
01:33:05,750 --> 01:33:08,042
Now it's impossible
to catch Banne Singh

1683
01:33:08,083 --> 01:33:09,667
He would've escaped to nowhere.

1684
01:33:09,750 --> 01:33:12,000
Didn't I warn, not to
go inside that village.

1685
01:33:12,292 --> 01:33:14,250
We should get a force of 500
and destroy that village.

1686
01:33:14,375 --> 01:33:16,458
Kill them in an encounter,
only then they'll fear.

1687
01:33:16,500 --> 01:33:19,000
Shall we put him down in
encounter and return, Nazeer?

1688
01:33:21,708 --> 01:33:22,708
I was hasty.

1689
01:33:24,250 --> 01:33:25,292
-Madhu.
-Huh!?

1690
01:33:25,292 --> 01:33:27,083
I need to meet the informers who
were dealing with Hawarias.

1691
01:33:27,125 --> 01:33:29,000
No one will rat them out.

1692
01:33:30,750 --> 01:33:32,708
These people didn't learn
even after such bashing.

1693
01:33:35,792 --> 01:33:37,750
You haven't left for home yet?

1694
01:33:38,083 --> 01:33:39,625
Everyone return
to your hometown,

1695
01:33:39,708 --> 01:33:41,625
if not will get killed.

1696
01:33:43,708 --> 01:33:45,792
It's really impossible
to catch them.

1697
01:33:45,833 --> 01:33:46,792
Because they,

1698
01:33:46,875 --> 01:33:50,125
will hide in to the Aravalli
river which connects 5 states.

1699
01:33:50,167 --> 01:33:52,750
No point in searching, 'cause we won't
know even if they're close to us.

1700
01:33:52,792 --> 01:33:55,375
They'll be moving from
one place to another.

1701
01:33:55,375 --> 01:33:56,667
Catching them is impossible.

1702
01:33:56,708 --> 01:33:59,042
I'll arrange a meeting to
compromise personally.

1703
01:33:59,083 --> 01:34:01,708
If they promise, will never
come towards Madras.

1704
01:34:01,833 --> 01:34:03,250
They'll never commit a
crime in their home state.

1705
01:34:03,292 --> 01:34:05,542
As they go to every State, they're
well versed with all languages.

1706
01:34:05,750 --> 01:34:07,292
If they're looking at a child,

1707
01:34:07,333 --> 01:34:09,083
they wouldn't see
them like a child.

1708
01:34:09,083 --> 01:34:10,708
Only their jewels will
be visible to them.

1709
01:34:10,750 --> 01:34:11,917
If we rat them out,

1710
01:34:11,917 --> 01:34:13,917
they'll kill the entire family.

1711
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:37,292
Lawyer Sir.

1712
01:34:39,333 --> 01:34:42,458
Police has never
come looking for us.

1713
01:34:42,792 --> 01:34:45,375
Then how come, these
Madrasi Police is here?

1714
01:34:45,833 --> 01:34:48,208
You had killed an MLA
in Gummidipoondi.

1715
01:34:48,292 --> 01:34:50,042
Really!? I killed an MLA?

1716
01:34:55,583 --> 01:34:58,042
Damn it, he was
pointing a knife at me.

1717
01:34:58,917 --> 01:35:00,667
I shot him with my gun.

1718
01:35:02,333 --> 01:35:03,583
The bullet went in,

1719
01:35:03,583 --> 01:35:04,958
and the heart popped out.

1720
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,792
But how did they figure
out, that it was us?

1721
01:35:19,833 --> 01:35:20,792
With fingerprints.

1722
01:35:21,625 --> 01:35:22,625
Fingerprints!?

1723
01:35:25,083 --> 01:35:27,208
We got to be careful
with these Madrasis.

1724
01:35:27,708 --> 01:35:30,083
They're here with just
this information.

1725
01:35:30,583 --> 01:35:31,583
Banne Singh.

1726
01:35:32,083 --> 01:35:34,625
You made a mistake by attacking
them at your village.

1727
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:36,958
That Madrasi is not alone,

1728
01:35:37,458 --> 01:35:38,917
he is Government.

1729
01:35:39,208 --> 01:35:42,375
They'll return, after
searching for few days.

1730
01:35:42,500 --> 01:35:44,708
Till then make sure
not to get caught,

1731
01:35:45,042 --> 01:35:47,167
and lay low working
under someone.

1732
01:35:47,292 --> 01:35:48,250
If there's anything,

1733
01:35:48,250 --> 01:35:50,000
I'll send a word
through the lawyer.

1734
01:35:50,208 --> 01:35:51,833
I will be in Aravalli mountains,

1735
01:35:51,875 --> 01:35:55,000
safe and sound with the
blessings of Grey Wolves.

1736
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:56,042
Jai Baouli!

1737
01:35:56,042 --> 01:35:57,208
Jai Baouli!

1738
01:36:00,792 --> 01:36:03,083
There's an informer named Pandit
who is the Village president,

1739
01:36:03,125 --> 01:36:05,375
He supplies betel nuts to
the shops in this district.

1740
01:36:05,458 --> 01:36:07,583
He's well connected
with Hawaria Gang.

1741
01:36:07,583 --> 01:36:09,625
He's the only one,
who can help you.

1742
01:36:09,750 --> 01:36:10,500
Where's he?

1743
01:36:21,417 --> 01:36:22,083
Sir.

1744
01:36:22,167 --> 01:36:23,167
That's Pandit.

1745
01:36:25,667 --> 01:36:26,792
Let me go Sir.

1746
01:36:26,792 --> 01:36:28,500
I don't mind even
going to the prison.

1747
01:36:28,625 --> 01:36:30,875
I will never rat
out the Hawarians.

1748
01:36:30,917 --> 01:36:34,000
I'll rather be in prison, than
getting tortured to death by them.

1749
01:36:34,125 --> 01:36:35,167
I'll give you protection.

1750
01:36:35,375 --> 01:36:36,375
Protection!?

1751
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:39,083
Do you even realize how
dangerous they're?

1752
01:36:39,417 --> 01:36:41,875
They'll leave poisonous snake
in to the house and runaway.

1753
01:36:41,917 --> 01:36:44,125
They'll burn down the house, while
you're sleeping in the night.

1754
01:36:44,167 --> 01:36:45,875
Then, how will your
protection help me.

1755
01:36:46,667 --> 01:36:49,875
They're not scared of Police,
like they do in your city.

1756
01:36:50,250 --> 01:36:52,375
They'll shoot you down.

1757
01:36:52,542 --> 01:36:54,042
Who are Hawarias?

1758
01:36:54,083 --> 01:36:56,625
Where did they come from? And
how they became Dacoits?

1759
01:36:56,625 --> 01:36:59,375
It's easy to talk without
knowing their history.

1760
01:36:59,708 --> 01:37:00,375
I know.

1761
01:37:00,417 --> 01:37:01,542
What do you know, Sir?

1762
01:37:01,583 --> 01:37:03,125
What do you know? Tell
me something then.

1763
01:37:03,417 --> 01:37:05,042
They're descendants of Hajputs.

1764
01:37:09,542 --> 01:37:10,625
Hawarians!

1765
01:37:10,750 --> 01:37:14,083
They were highly skilled Guerrilla
warriors in Hajput's army.

1766
01:37:14,250 --> 01:37:15,417
In 1600 AD.

1767
01:37:15,750 --> 01:37:19,042
Hajputs and Mughlai's
had a huge war.

1768
01:37:19,333 --> 01:37:22,000
Hajputs who came
with a huge army,

1769
01:37:22,125 --> 01:37:24,375
Mughlai who was with a
much smaller army...

1770
01:37:24,417 --> 01:37:27,250
...stood strong against Mughlais
with their unique strategy.

1771
01:37:29,583 --> 01:37:30,958
Hajput warriors,

1772
01:37:31,042 --> 01:37:33,417
always pray to Baouli
before going to war...

1773
01:37:33,792 --> 01:37:36,792
...with a belief to return
victorious and without loss of life.

1774
01:37:37,417 --> 01:37:39,000
For which there was
a ritual performed.

1775
01:37:39,375 --> 01:37:41,333
But in the war Hajputs
were defeated,

1776
01:37:41,375 --> 01:37:43,167
and many warriors
died during the war.

1777
01:37:43,792 --> 01:37:45,708
The Empire of Hajputs
was destroyed.

1778
01:37:48,542 --> 01:37:50,167
The ritual which was
performed before the war,

1779
01:37:50,375 --> 01:37:52,500
Hawarians had, War-God Baouli...

1780
01:37:52,625 --> 01:37:54,625
...stained it with cow's blood.

1781
01:37:54,958 --> 01:37:57,542
It's their sin which
led to defeat,

1782
01:37:57,583 --> 01:37:59,875
and were chased out
in to the forest.

1783
01:38:11,250 --> 01:38:13,125
After Hajput Empire
got defeated,

1784
01:38:13,167 --> 01:38:15,750
Hawarians were left with no job.

1785
01:38:15,792 --> 01:38:17,958
And were in fear of getting
killed by Mughlais.

1786
01:38:18,167 --> 01:38:19,542
They remained hiding
inside the forest,

1787
01:38:19,583 --> 01:38:22,500
hunting and thieving making their
living, is what the stories state.

1788
01:38:24,208 --> 01:38:25,167
Hawarians,

1789
01:38:25,208 --> 01:38:28,083
lived as hunters
for generations.

1790
01:38:28,083 --> 01:38:31,375
In the 80's Government
issued a ban on hunting.

1791
01:38:31,625 --> 01:38:33,833
They returned to the
village for survival.

1792
01:38:36,250 --> 01:38:38,250
There they neither
got job nor respect,

1793
01:38:38,417 --> 01:38:40,083
and their life
became a tough one.

1794
01:38:40,500 --> 01:38:41,958
Due to which, a few of them,

1795
01:38:42,042 --> 01:38:43,333
turned to hunting again.

1796
01:38:43,750 --> 01:38:44,833
But this time,

1797
01:38:45,375 --> 01:38:46,542
they were hunting humans.

1798
01:39:00,958 --> 01:39:03,833
Not bad, even our Police is
not aware of such things.

1799
01:39:04,542 --> 01:39:05,667
But Sir...

1800
01:39:06,458 --> 01:39:08,458
They never stay in one place,

1801
01:39:08,500 --> 01:39:09,958
they keep changing cities.

1802
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,458
If you have to get
a hold on them...

1803
01:39:13,833 --> 01:39:15,542
...then it'll cost you a lot.

1804
01:39:15,917 --> 01:39:16,958
One information,

1805
01:39:17,333 --> 01:39:18,167
will fetch you 50,000/-.

1806
01:39:18,500 --> 01:39:19,500
Fifty...

1807
01:39:20,417 --> 01:39:21,417
...Thousand uh?

1808
01:39:21,708 --> 01:39:23,208
For just one information!?

1809
01:39:26,125 --> 01:39:26,958
Are you serious?

1810
01:39:29,833 --> 01:39:31,458
You're not kidding right?

1811
01:39:35,125 --> 01:39:36,125
Ok Sir.

1812
01:39:36,417 --> 01:39:36,958
Sir.

1813
01:39:37,583 --> 01:39:38,500
Here on...

1814
01:39:38,708 --> 01:39:40,500
...don't come to
see me in person.

1815
01:39:40,750 --> 01:39:42,167
If someone in the
village comes to know,

1816
01:39:42,208 --> 01:39:43,625
they'll come to know about it.

1817
01:39:44,667 --> 01:39:45,500
I'll...

1818
01:39:45,542 --> 01:39:48,042
...inquire through
the betel sellers.

1819
01:39:48,333 --> 01:39:49,875
If there's an information.

1820
01:39:50,125 --> 01:39:52,250
My guy's shop at the
foot of the fort,

1821
01:39:52,333 --> 01:39:53,958
will wear a green turban.

1822
01:39:55,833 --> 01:39:58,542
We then started to wait
for that green Turban.

1823
01:39:59,833 --> 01:40:02,042
Pandit's men were on
lookout on one side,

1824
01:40:02,083 --> 01:40:03,167
and on the other side us...

1825
01:40:03,250 --> 01:40:06,625
...road side tents, railway platforms, we
didn't spare any place in search of them.

1826
01:40:07,083 --> 01:40:08,917
It was months since
any of us went home,

1827
01:40:09,125 --> 01:40:11,250
we were longing for a
information on Banne Singh.

1828
01:40:11,333 --> 01:40:12,625
In the process we
went State to State.

1829
01:40:12,750 --> 01:40:14,417
started searching
across North India.

1830
01:40:18,250 --> 01:40:20,792
We kept going nudging
cold, hot sun and dust.

1831
01:40:21,458 --> 01:40:22,875
We slept where ever
we got a place.

1832
01:40:23,500 --> 01:40:25,958
There shouldn't be another
life lost due to this gang.

1833
01:40:26,417 --> 01:40:28,250
We we're extremely
outraged in catching them.

1834
01:40:28,792 --> 01:40:30,833
All this gave the strength
to endure everything.

1835
01:40:33,583 --> 01:40:35,375
The food in North
didn't favour us.

1836
01:40:35,417 --> 01:40:36,417
With very less funds.

1837
01:40:36,458 --> 01:40:37,833
We took utensils
in our vehicles,

1838
01:40:37,917 --> 01:40:40,542
and made food at places
where we rested.

1839
01:40:42,792 --> 01:40:44,583
It tastes good, Sir.

1840
01:40:46,625 --> 01:40:48,333
You wife is very lucky.

1841
01:40:56,625 --> 01:40:57,708
How's it?

1842
01:41:03,542 --> 01:41:04,542
"B"

1843
01:41:06,542 --> 01:41:07,250
"A"

1844
01:41:11,042 --> 01:41:11,667
"It's Bad!?"

1845
01:41:14,417 --> 01:41:15,750
This is awesome!

1846
01:41:44,625 --> 01:41:45,625
Brother, stop right there.

1847
01:41:45,667 --> 01:41:46,917
He's wearing a green turban.

1848
01:41:51,375 --> 01:41:52,500
Is the Special Betel here?

1849
01:41:52,792 --> 01:41:53,750
"Get me one Betel!"

1850
01:41:57,417 --> 01:41:59,500
Sir, we got an
information from Pandit.

1851
01:42:00,125 --> 01:42:00,708
Very good.

1852
01:42:01,250 --> 01:42:02,917
-Sethu, assemble everyone.
-Yes Sir.

1853
01:42:02,917 --> 01:42:05,458
Sathya you stand down for this operation,
I have something else for you.

1854
01:42:06,875 --> 01:42:07,625
Sir.

1855
01:42:08,042 --> 01:42:09,625
Remove me from this team.

1856
01:42:10,167 --> 01:42:12,792
It's hurting to see
your concern about me.

1857
01:42:13,792 --> 01:42:15,583
You don't have to feel
bad, whenever you see me.

1858
01:42:16,042 --> 01:42:17,042
Please send me away.

1859
01:42:17,833 --> 01:42:18,833
Everyone has assembled, Sir?

1860
01:42:19,417 --> 01:42:20,042
Yes Sir!

1861
01:42:26,042 --> 01:42:27,667
Follow the guy in this paper.

1862
01:42:30,083 --> 01:42:30,917
Thanks Sir.

1863
01:42:39,833 --> 01:42:40,625
Haram Singh.

1864
01:42:40,667 --> 01:42:41,667
Age 55.

1865
01:42:41,792 --> 01:42:42,958
Banne Singh's Uncle.

1866
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:44,250
Organizer of this gang.

1867
01:42:44,250 --> 01:42:45,625
Works as a VAO(Village
Administrative Officer).

1868
01:42:45,667 --> 01:42:47,042
They call him "Patwaari" here.

1869
01:42:47,125 --> 01:42:49,167
The only educated person
from their caste.

1870
01:42:49,250 --> 01:42:51,833
He secretly collects
information about the gang.

1871
01:42:51,833 --> 01:42:53,833
And resolve issues
if any among them.

1872
01:42:53,875 --> 01:42:55,917
Handles all legal problems
pertaining to them.

1873
01:42:56,167 --> 01:42:58,625
Converting the looted
Jewels in to money.

1874
01:42:58,667 --> 01:42:59,667
All of this is done by him.

1875
01:43:00,667 --> 01:43:01,792
If we nab him.

1876
01:43:01,833 --> 01:43:03,083
Banne Singh who escaped,

1877
01:43:03,125 --> 01:43:03,917
that gang,

1878
01:43:03,917 --> 01:43:06,250
also we can gather information
about the gang leader.

1879
01:43:07,250 --> 01:43:09,000
As he's got a good support
with local Police,

1880
01:43:09,083 --> 01:43:10,500
he's happily moving
around the village.

1881
01:43:10,667 --> 01:43:13,167
He comes down to Bharatpur market
everyday to collect interest.

1882
01:43:13,333 --> 01:43:15,167
That's where we'll pick him up,
without anyone's knowledge.

1883
01:43:15,333 --> 01:43:17,083
For this Banne Singh's
village was a better option.

1884
01:43:17,125 --> 01:43:19,375
All the rowdies will be
present at the market.

1885
01:43:19,542 --> 01:43:20,917
You'll get caught.

1886
01:43:22,208 --> 01:43:24,250
First change our license
plates to a local one,

1887
01:43:24,250 --> 01:43:25,792
market will be crowded
in the morning.

1888
01:43:25,875 --> 01:43:28,042
If the crowd gathers while
we're arresting him,

1889
01:43:28,083 --> 01:43:29,125
or if the accused is alert,

1890
01:43:29,167 --> 01:43:30,125
the operation will be a failure.

1891
01:43:30,167 --> 01:43:31,333
Arrest is going to happen,

1892
01:43:31,375 --> 01:43:33,083
or it happened, no one
should come to know it.

1893
01:43:33,125 --> 01:43:34,250
I'll let you know the plan,

1894
01:43:34,250 --> 01:43:36,042
there's shouldn't
be another failure.

1895
01:43:54,667 --> 01:43:55,667
Haram Singh is here.

1896
01:43:55,750 --> 01:43:56,708
Two minutes.

1897
01:43:56,750 --> 01:43:58,917
Before the people get a whiff of it,
we'll nab Haram Singh and leave.

1898
01:43:58,958 --> 01:43:59,458
Ok Sir!

1899
01:43:59,458 --> 01:44:00,542
Two minutes!?

1900
01:44:00,542 --> 01:44:02,583
Even if it's two hours,
you can't nab him.

1901
01:44:02,583 --> 01:44:03,792
It won't take that long...

1902
01:44:03,833 --> 01:44:05,375
...you run to that
gate and get back.

1903
01:44:05,750 --> 01:44:07,542
-By then we'll nab him.
-What if you don't?

1904
01:44:07,583 --> 01:44:08,875
We'll leave this city.

1905
01:44:09,042 --> 01:44:11,333
If you're going to leave the
city, then why just once...

1906
01:44:11,375 --> 01:44:12,667
...I'll do it four times.

1907
01:44:12,958 --> 01:44:14,250
Shall I go?

1908
01:44:14,417 --> 01:44:16,250
Hey, look here I come!

1909
01:44:16,333 --> 01:44:17,167
Nazeer!

1910
01:44:17,250 --> 01:44:18,708
-Sir!
-Madhu is running,

1911
01:44:18,708 --> 01:44:20,000
scream out thief and
run behind him.

1912
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:21,500
-He's our guy.
-Do it.

1913
01:44:21,583 --> 01:44:23,125
Thief, catch him,
catch him, thief.

1914
01:44:23,167 --> 01:44:23,875
Thief! Thief!

1915
01:44:23,917 --> 01:44:26,250
-Thief! Thief!
-Oh no, he's planned something.

1916
01:44:26,250 --> 01:44:28,375
-Hey, I'm not a thief.
-Stop him, he's a thief.

1917
01:44:28,417 --> 01:44:29,417
Sathya ready?

1918
01:44:29,458 --> 01:44:30,625
He's a thief, catch him.

1919
01:44:32,333 --> 01:44:33,833
Hey, please listen to
what I have to say.

1920
01:44:33,875 --> 01:44:36,083
Hey, Hey, please...please
let me go.

1921
01:44:36,625 --> 01:44:37,958
Vicky move.

1922
01:44:42,125 --> 01:44:42,875
Chandu.

1923
01:44:47,958 --> 01:44:49,083
Sethu cover.

1924
01:44:50,875 --> 01:44:52,042
Nab him.

1925
01:44:52,083 --> 01:44:52,833
Hey!

1926
01:44:53,250 --> 01:44:55,083
Now stuff bananas
in to his mouth.

1927
01:45:20,833 --> 01:45:22,792
I'll listen to anything
you asked me of.

1928
01:45:22,875 --> 01:45:24,875
But please don't ask me to run.

1929
01:45:26,833 --> 01:45:29,792
Arrange for transit warrant to
take Haram Singh to Chennai.

1930
01:45:29,917 --> 01:45:34,708
The 10 years search of the burglars came
to an end with Haram Singh's arrest.

1931
01:45:34,917 --> 01:45:37,333
In regards to that, many
officers from other states,

1932
01:45:37,375 --> 01:45:39,542
congratulated DSP Theeran
on this achievement.

1933
01:45:39,625 --> 01:45:42,958
Also DSP Theeran assured that the
leader of the gang will caught soon.

1934
01:45:43,083 --> 01:45:46,167
Seems like the investigation
will reveal more information.

1935
01:45:49,250 --> 01:45:51,667
Constable ask the biker
not to come this side.

1936
01:45:51,708 --> 01:45:53,250
don't come this way.

1937
01:45:53,458 --> 01:45:54,708
Hey who's in there?

1938
01:45:54,708 --> 01:45:56,583
Who's that? come outside.

1939
01:45:58,417 --> 01:46:00,333
Sorry Sir, we're lovers.

1940
01:46:00,333 --> 01:46:02,167
Family problems, so
were talking about it.

1941
01:46:02,208 --> 01:46:04,542
What kind of discussion
happens inside the bushes?

1942
01:46:06,458 --> 01:46:07,458
I'm Innocent.

1943
01:46:08,542 --> 01:46:09,125
Speak.

1944
01:46:09,125 --> 01:46:10,000
I'm Innocent.

1945
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,125
"Begunah" means Innocent, Sir.

1946
01:46:12,250 --> 01:46:13,375
I'm Innocent.

1947
01:46:13,417 --> 01:46:14,417
Speak up.

1948
01:46:15,667 --> 01:46:16,750
Speak up.

1949
01:46:16,792 --> 01:46:18,125
I'm Innocent.

1950
01:46:19,250 --> 01:46:20,708
I'm Innocent.

1951
01:46:21,167 --> 01:46:22,875
I'm...I'm Innocent.

1952
01:46:23,500 --> 01:46:25,583
-Speak up.
-I'm Innocent.

1953
01:46:25,833 --> 01:46:26,708
He's saying that...

1954
01:46:26,708 --> 01:46:29,458
...I get it, he's been ranting
the same for days now.

1955
01:46:29,500 --> 01:46:31,542
"I'm Innocent"

1956
01:46:34,250 --> 01:46:36,875
He doesn't seem to budge for
beatings, make him talk.

1957
01:46:36,917 --> 01:46:37,667
Strip him naked.

1958
01:46:37,708 --> 01:46:40,125
He'll open his mouth at the 30th
second of bed bugs treatment.

1959
01:46:40,917 --> 01:46:42,250
Why the bed bugs?

1960
01:46:42,375 --> 01:46:45,542
Once the heat is felt by the bed bugs,
they'll pierce through the navel.

1961
01:46:45,583 --> 01:46:47,333
Then he'll talk due
to unbearable pain.

1962
01:47:08,625 --> 01:47:10,458
I'm Innocent, Sir.

1963
01:47:10,583 --> 01:47:11,583
How do we break him?

1964
01:47:11,750 --> 01:47:13,458
He doesn't seem to budge,

1965
01:47:13,500 --> 01:47:15,333
keeps ranting that
he's Innocent.

1966
01:47:15,333 --> 01:47:16,917
-Sir!
-Sir!

1967
01:47:41,833 --> 01:47:44,500
If you don't tell us where's
Banne Singh and the gang leader,

1968
01:47:44,500 --> 01:47:46,542
I'll make the same hole
on his head this time.

1969
01:47:46,583 --> 01:47:48,500
If you don't tell us
where's Banne Singh,

1970
01:47:48,542 --> 01:47:50,833
next time the bullet
will be in your head.

1971
01:47:51,833 --> 01:47:52,375
I'm...

1972
01:47:52,833 --> 01:47:53,708
I'm...

1973
01:47:54,958 --> 01:47:55,750
I'm...

1974
01:47:56,875 --> 01:47:58,500
I'm Innocent, Sir.

1975
01:47:58,667 --> 01:48:00,208
Damn it!

1976
01:48:00,250 --> 01:48:01,125
He keeps repeating it.

1977
01:48:01,125 --> 01:48:02,875
I'm Innocent, Sir.

1978
01:48:03,458 --> 01:48:04,583
For 15 days,

1979
01:48:04,625 --> 01:48:06,000
we tortured an old man,

1980
01:48:06,042 --> 01:48:07,375
but the fact he didn't budge...

1981
01:48:07,833 --> 01:48:09,500
...was really surprising to us.

1982
01:48:09,708 --> 01:48:11,458
Their threshold for pain,

1983
01:48:11,667 --> 01:48:13,583
and loyalty to their clan.

1984
01:48:13,625 --> 01:48:15,250
We were not able to break that.

1985
01:48:15,458 --> 01:48:18,458
We tried extending
the remand time.

1986
01:48:18,833 --> 01:48:20,375
Aren't you ashamed?

1987
01:48:21,250 --> 01:48:23,167
You brought an old man,

1988
01:48:23,250 --> 01:48:25,833
and accusing him of all
the theft's and murders.

1989
01:48:26,667 --> 01:48:29,125
If you don't manage to get the
right evidence next time,

1990
01:48:29,250 --> 01:48:30,875
I won't extend the remand.

1991
01:48:32,167 --> 01:48:33,250
First pay him.

1992
01:48:34,167 --> 01:48:36,583
Thank you sir, next time
please get us a bail.

1993
01:48:38,458 --> 01:48:40,625
Is everything fine,
well and good?

1994
01:48:40,875 --> 01:48:42,833
So Banne Singh escaped,

1995
01:48:42,833 --> 01:48:44,417
and he cannot be caught.

1996
01:48:44,667 --> 01:48:46,333
No idea who's the gang leader.

1997
01:48:46,375 --> 01:48:48,125
So can't catch him either.

1998
01:48:48,875 --> 01:48:51,583
Wonder which corner of
India is that gang hiding.

1999
01:48:51,625 --> 01:48:54,167
Due to which no
Police can catch him.

2000
01:48:54,458 --> 01:48:55,625
No witnesses.

2001
01:48:55,625 --> 01:48:58,042
Even we arrest them, can't
do anything about it.

2002
01:48:58,125 --> 01:49:00,750
Haram Singh will get a bail,

2003
01:49:00,750 --> 01:49:02,667
and the case will be
closed, that's great!

2004
01:49:03,458 --> 01:49:04,083
Sir.

2005
01:49:04,125 --> 01:49:05,917
-One week.
-It's a summon from Human Rights.

2006
01:49:05,917 --> 01:49:08,417
They've complained about you
torturing the innocent.

2007
01:49:08,875 --> 01:49:10,167
You're all words,

2008
01:49:10,167 --> 01:49:12,250
go and withdraw the operation...

2009
01:49:12,250 --> 01:49:14,083
...compromise with
them not to come here.

2010
01:49:14,167 --> 01:49:15,167
Then get hold of two,

2011
01:49:15,167 --> 01:49:18,042
and issue a press release stating
they're the accused from MLA's case.

2012
01:49:18,042 --> 01:49:19,458
And find a way to
close the case.

2013
01:49:20,958 --> 01:49:21,708
Ok Sir.

2014
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:23,708
I'll take care of it.

2015
01:49:26,583 --> 01:49:27,583
-Hold this.
-Sir.

2016
01:49:27,833 --> 01:49:28,833
Just a little more time...

2017
01:49:31,583 --> 01:49:32,583
What's it Theeran?...

2018
01:49:32,667 --> 01:49:34,417
...heard you're going
to compromise.

2019
01:49:34,417 --> 01:49:35,417
Congratulations.

2020
01:49:41,792 --> 01:49:43,500
-Are we going to stop the operation?
-Yes.

2021
01:49:43,583 --> 01:49:45,167
"We didn't hit Haram Singh", get a
signature from him confirming that.

2022
01:49:45,167 --> 01:49:48,083
-We're going to compromise.
-Sir...Sir...Sir!

2023
01:49:54,708 --> 01:49:55,667
Have fun!

2024
01:50:21,625 --> 01:50:23,792
"Bangles are rattling"

2025
01:50:23,833 --> 01:50:25,917
"Just for you my dear"

2026
01:50:30,500 --> 01:50:32,458
"Be aggressive with your touch"

2027
01:50:32,500 --> 01:50:34,625
"Every time we come
across each other"

2028
01:50:39,375 --> 01:50:43,417
"Oh my god of thunder,
I'm yours forever"

2029
01:50:43,500 --> 01:50:47,750
"My body is quivering, you
take me along with you"

2030
01:50:47,750 --> 01:50:52,083
"Oh my god of thunder,
I'm yours forever"

2031
01:50:52,125 --> 01:50:56,083
"It's my heart 'n' body
and your opulence"

2032
01:51:05,083 --> 01:51:07,375
"Bangles are rattling"

2033
01:51:07,375 --> 01:51:09,542
"Just for you my dear"

2034
01:51:17,667 --> 01:51:18,708
Sir, It's Pandit.

2035
01:51:19,500 --> 01:51:21,542
Heard that you're
going to compromise.

2036
01:51:22,500 --> 01:51:23,583
Where are you right now?

2037
01:51:23,625 --> 01:51:25,417
I'm on my way to Delhi
Pandit, tell me.

2038
01:51:25,667 --> 01:51:26,417
Listen then.

2039
01:51:26,958 --> 01:51:29,167
I have a vital
information with me.

2040
01:51:29,208 --> 01:51:29,875
Where should I come?

2041
01:51:29,917 --> 01:51:30,917
I'll call tomorrow with it.

2042
01:51:31,667 --> 01:51:35,708
"Ravish me with
colors, oh my dear"

2043
01:51:35,708 --> 01:51:36,750
"My booty too..."

2044
01:51:37,917 --> 01:51:40,167
"Oh My Dear"

2045
01:51:48,708 --> 01:51:52,667
"You don't have worry
about anything"

2046
01:51:53,042 --> 01:51:56,750
"You're there wherever honey is"

2047
01:51:56,792 --> 01:51:57,333
"Come on"

2048
01:51:57,458 --> 01:52:01,333
"You're the sanity to
my wild temptations"

2049
01:52:01,875 --> 01:52:05,583
"You're the apex to my climax"

2050
01:52:05,583 --> 01:52:09,833
"Oh my body is swaying away"

2051
01:52:09,875 --> 01:52:14,167
"Oh my body is swaying away"

2052
01:52:14,167 --> 01:52:19,500
"Come on let's play
Holi, oh dear"

2053
01:52:23,750 --> 01:52:25,917
"Bangles are rattling"

2054
01:52:25,917 --> 01:52:28,083
"Just for you my dear"

2055
01:52:32,417 --> 01:52:34,625
"Be aggressive with your touch"

2056
01:52:34,667 --> 01:52:36,833
"Every time we come
across each other"

2057
01:52:41,167 --> 01:52:45,542
"Oh my god of thunder,
I'm yours forever"

2058
01:52:45,583 --> 01:52:49,875
"My body is quivering, you
take me along with you"

2059
01:52:50,167 --> 01:52:54,250
"Oh my god of thunder,
I'm yours forever"

2060
01:52:54,542 --> 01:52:58,333
"It's my heart 'n' body
and your opulence"

2061
01:53:11,875 --> 01:53:14,583
How can you arrest a Govt. Officer
without following any rules?

2062
01:53:14,625 --> 01:53:16,250
Won't you respect the Law?

2063
01:53:16,333 --> 01:53:17,833
You've nabbed him like a rowdy.

2064
01:53:17,875 --> 01:53:20,375
It's become a routine for the
Police to frame the innocent.

2065
01:53:22,458 --> 01:53:23,625
Read this file.

2066
01:53:23,750 --> 01:53:24,583
And then you can take a call.

2067
01:53:24,583 --> 01:53:25,583
Leave that here.

2068
01:53:26,875 --> 01:53:28,583
Once you've compromised
with Hawarians.

2069
01:53:28,667 --> 01:53:30,500
Ask them to take back the
complaint from Human Rights.

2070
01:53:30,792 --> 01:53:31,500
Ok Sir.

2071
01:53:33,625 --> 01:53:34,125
Hello!

2072
01:53:34,167 --> 01:53:36,083
Sir, get to Rupwas check
post's betel shop.

2073
01:53:36,125 --> 01:53:37,750
Rupwas Check Post, that's great.

2074
01:53:37,917 --> 01:53:38,708
I'll be there right away.

2075
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:41,250
Nazeer, ask our team to
be at Rupwas check post.

2076
01:53:41,250 --> 01:53:41,792
Ok Sir!

2077
01:53:41,833 --> 01:53:43,250
Let's finish that compromise.

2078
01:53:44,250 --> 01:53:46,458
Get 5-6 of them from our team,

2079
01:53:46,500 --> 01:53:48,375
and get to Rupwas check post.

2080
01:53:48,500 --> 01:53:49,250
Sathya!

2081
01:53:49,500 --> 01:53:51,250
Tomorrow when we'll take
Haram Singh to the court,

2082
01:53:51,708 --> 01:53:53,250
Sir, what if it goes wrong.

2083
01:53:53,333 --> 01:53:54,333
No matter what happens,

2084
01:53:54,500 --> 01:53:55,375
be brave about it.

2085
01:53:55,625 --> 01:53:56,708
I'll take care of it.

2086
01:54:10,583 --> 01:54:13,042
Madras Police is coming
down to compromise.

2087
01:54:13,083 --> 01:54:15,542
If two gets surrendered,
the case can be closed.

2088
01:54:15,583 --> 01:54:16,625
Hey, Muthupandi.

2089
01:54:16,792 --> 01:54:18,958
That Hindi guy will
get released on bail.

2090
01:54:19,083 --> 01:54:21,750
On the way back get the
other accused under remand.

2091
01:54:21,875 --> 01:54:23,833
-Over!
-Ok Sir, Over!

2092
01:54:46,917 --> 01:54:48,000
-Sir!
-Sir!

2093
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:51,458
Didn't expect the case to
end with a compromise.

2094
01:54:51,792 --> 01:54:52,792
Let it go!

2095
01:54:53,708 --> 01:54:55,542
There's a Special Betel
famous in this place,

2096
01:54:55,583 --> 01:54:56,792
It's said to be good when
taken with empty stomach.

2097
01:54:56,833 --> 01:54:58,000
-Sir how come you...
-Let's have that.

2098
01:54:58,458 --> 01:55:00,083
-Come on.
-How come Sir?

2099
01:55:01,250 --> 01:55:02,417
Is the special Beeda here?

2100
01:55:09,542 --> 01:55:12,625
It doesn't look like we're
here for compromise.

2101
01:56:22,833 --> 01:56:24,250
It's Banne Singh, Sir.

2102
01:56:29,542 --> 01:56:30,167
Move!

2103
01:56:30,792 --> 01:56:32,000
Move, who the hell are you?

2104
01:56:32,375 --> 01:56:33,042
Move!

2105
01:56:34,625 --> 01:56:35,833
-Who are you?
-Hey!

2106
01:56:36,917 --> 01:56:38,833
This Madrasi is beating
up one of the local,

2107
01:56:38,875 --> 01:56:40,083
how can you guys stand still
without doing anything?

2108
01:56:40,125 --> 01:56:41,167
Please do something!

2109
01:56:41,208 --> 01:56:42,042
Sir, Sir.

2110
01:56:42,917 --> 01:56:44,917
Sir, Sir, Sir...he's
getting out.

2111
01:56:46,958 --> 01:56:48,417
He's beating me again.

2112
01:56:50,583 --> 01:56:52,458
Hey Guddu, the bus
shouldn't stop.

2113
01:56:52,500 --> 01:56:53,417
Get to the driver.

2114
01:56:53,417 --> 01:56:54,917
I'll shoot, if you stop the bus.

2115
01:56:54,958 --> 01:56:56,542
Sir, Sir, Sir...he's
getting out.

2116
01:57:07,917 --> 01:57:09,542
Hey Madrasi, I'll shoot
if you come closer.

2117
01:57:11,958 --> 01:57:12,750
Let it go, let it go.

2118
01:57:12,792 --> 01:57:14,417
Get off us, get off us.

2119
01:57:14,417 --> 01:57:15,542
He's Tamilnadu Police.

2120
01:57:15,542 --> 01:57:16,875
We're Tamilnadu Police.

2121
01:57:16,917 --> 01:57:18,250
We're Police damn it, let go.

2122
01:57:33,125 --> 01:57:33,750
Sir!

2123
01:57:33,792 --> 01:57:34,958
Sir climb up, I got him.

2124
01:57:38,792 --> 01:57:39,458
Hey!

2125
01:57:39,625 --> 01:57:40,625
If you come closer...

2126
01:57:40,625 --> 01:57:42,917
-Nazeer!
-We won't do anything.

2127
01:57:44,333 --> 01:57:44,958
Sir!

2128
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:46,125
Stop the bus Nazeer.

2129
01:57:46,167 --> 01:57:48,125
Banne Singh's guy has the
driver at gun point.

2130
01:57:48,125 --> 01:57:49,333
Not letting him stop the bus.

2131
01:57:49,375 --> 01:57:51,083
If he shoots the driver,
the bus will topple.

2132
01:57:51,125 --> 01:57:54,333
Did you hear that? if the bus
topples everyone will be dead.

2133
01:57:54,333 --> 01:57:55,625
You'll be responsible for that.

2134
01:57:57,250 --> 01:57:58,792
Be careful Sir, he
might push you down.

2135
01:57:59,125 --> 01:58:00,083
Sir, the balance is going off.

2136
01:58:00,125 --> 01:58:01,333
Surrender yourself.

2137
01:58:01,417 --> 01:58:02,625
Nazeer stop the bus.

2138
01:58:02,708 --> 01:58:03,417
We're Policemen.

2139
01:58:03,417 --> 01:58:05,458
Sit down, Sit down, Sit down.

2140
01:58:12,375 --> 01:58:13,250
Don't come closer.

2141
01:58:17,083 --> 01:58:18,875
If you don't surrender
yourself...

2142
01:58:19,417 --> 01:58:20,542
He's jumping Sir...

2143
01:58:20,542 --> 01:58:21,750
...Sethu catch him.

2144
01:58:21,792 --> 01:58:23,417
I caught hold of his leg.

2145
01:58:24,292 --> 01:58:25,833
Sir, that bus going
ahead of this one,

2146
01:58:25,875 --> 01:58:26,792
not able to hold on.

2147
01:58:26,833 --> 01:58:29,917
Nazeer ask both the buses to
maintain the same speed and level.

2148
01:58:29,958 --> 01:58:31,917
Driver, go with that bus.

2149
01:58:31,958 --> 01:58:33,250
Maintain the distance
on the right hand side.

2150
01:58:33,292 --> 01:58:35,875
Sethu, don't let go of him, if not
he will die caught under the tire.

2151
01:58:35,958 --> 01:58:38,625
If he dies, then we can't
get hold of the gang.

2152
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:45,958
Sir!

2153
01:58:46,500 --> 01:58:47,917
That bus is getting closer.

2154
01:58:59,958 --> 01:59:01,708
Ask him to go around.

2155
01:59:01,750 --> 01:59:03,917
Ask that bus to right
and maintain the gap.

2156
01:59:03,917 --> 01:59:06,500
There's a vehicle coming towards
us, maintain the distance.

2157
01:59:06,500 --> 01:59:08,208
Please maintain the distance.

2158
01:59:15,208 --> 01:59:17,250
Sir, the rope is slipping away.

2159
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:21,958
Sir! don't let go!

2160
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:23,458
Sir! don't let go!

2161
01:59:23,500 --> 01:59:24,958
Sir! don't let go!

2162
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:26,542
Sir! don't let go!

2163
01:59:26,583 --> 01:59:29,125
KABE!

2164
01:59:29,125 --> 01:59:30,417
Sir!

2165
01:59:30,458 --> 01:59:32,542
Sir! don't let go!

2166
01:59:32,625 --> 01:59:34,208
BOYS!

2167
01:59:35,125 --> 01:59:36,458
Sir, I'm coming, I'm coming.

2168
01:59:36,500 --> 01:59:37,500
Go closer.

2169
01:59:37,500 --> 01:59:38,458
Come on top,

2170
01:59:38,792 --> 01:59:39,833
Sir, Vicky is climbing up.

2171
01:59:40,583 --> 01:59:41,167
Sir!

2172
01:59:57,458 --> 01:59:58,708
Now let go of him.

2173
02:00:18,083 --> 02:00:18,917
Sir, Sir!

2174
02:00:19,625 --> 02:00:20,375
Sir!

2175
02:00:20,500 --> 02:00:22,292
Sir, please forgive me.

2176
02:00:22,292 --> 02:00:22,875
Sir.

2177
02:00:22,917 --> 02:00:24,833
Sir I'll surrender myself,
please forgive me.

2178
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:26,542
Sir I'll surrender myself.

2179
02:00:26,625 --> 02:00:27,833
I'll surrender myself,

2180
02:00:27,833 --> 02:00:28,625
forgive me.

2181
02:00:28,958 --> 02:00:29,292
Sir.

2182
02:00:29,375 --> 02:00:30,375
HEY!

2183
02:00:39,417 --> 02:00:41,000
Drive carefully,
don't ram in to Sir.

2184
02:00:41,042 --> 02:00:42,500
Sir, be careful.

2185
02:00:43,625 --> 02:00:44,583
Sir, he's getting away.

2186
02:01:38,750 --> 02:01:40,458
Why aren't you guys
here yet to compromise?

2187
02:01:40,500 --> 02:01:42,500
Sir, they're asking if we're
coming to compromise.

2188
02:01:45,208 --> 02:01:46,625
I'll inform that we have
already compromised.

2189
02:01:47,042 --> 02:01:48,417
Madrasis have
nabbed Banne Singh.

2190
02:01:48,458 --> 02:01:50,417
Oh God no!

2191
02:01:50,417 --> 02:01:52,042
Arul, turn around the vehicle.

2192
02:01:54,042 --> 02:01:54,708
Get down,

2193
02:01:54,708 --> 02:01:55,542
Get down damn it.

2194
02:01:55,583 --> 02:01:56,833
Let's see how you'll
get your bail.

2195
02:01:57,208 --> 02:01:58,208
Take that stone.

2196
02:01:58,208 --> 02:01:59,250
Die, damn it.

2197
02:02:05,250 --> 02:02:07,167
How dare you hit me!?

2198
02:02:19,333 --> 02:02:20,958
He attacked every one of you?

2199
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:23,083
-Am I right?
-Yes Sir.

2200
02:02:23,375 --> 02:02:24,500
It has become a routine.

2201
02:02:24,542 --> 02:02:25,792
I'm Inoocent, Sir.

2202
02:02:26,458 --> 02:02:27,625
I'm Innocent, Sir.

2203
02:02:27,625 --> 02:02:29,417
Banne Singh will not
open his mouth,

2204
02:02:29,417 --> 02:02:30,958
I'll bail him out soon.

2205
02:02:31,125 --> 02:02:32,292
You don't worry about it.

2206
02:02:37,792 --> 02:02:40,083
That Madrasi is a dangerous guy.

2207
02:02:41,708 --> 02:02:43,333
Also very smart.

2208
02:02:45,292 --> 02:02:47,208
How's he managing to
nab them spot on.

2209
02:02:49,458 --> 02:02:52,708
There's something happening
which is not right.

2210
02:02:55,625 --> 02:02:56,625
Find out what is it?

2211
02:02:56,708 --> 02:02:57,125
Sure brother.

2212
02:02:57,167 --> 02:02:57,917
Once you're done,

2213
02:02:58,125 --> 02:02:59,500
I'll be inside, Guru
Shikar mountains.

2214
02:02:59,583 --> 02:03:00,625
You can meet me there.

2215
02:03:01,875 --> 02:03:02,875
Daddy!

2216
02:03:02,958 --> 02:03:04,625
When will you be back Daddy?

2217
02:03:04,708 --> 02:03:05,875
Daddy is here with some work.

2218
02:03:05,958 --> 02:03:07,375
You be...I'll talk to you later.

2219
02:03:08,333 --> 02:03:10,042
Sir, torture room for
Banne Singh is ready.

2220
02:03:10,083 --> 02:03:11,625
Let us not torture him Sathya.

2221
02:03:11,708 --> 02:03:12,417
Why Sir?

2222
02:03:12,417 --> 02:03:13,458
Even If we hit him,

2223
02:03:13,750 --> 02:03:14,875
he'll plead innocent,

2224
02:03:14,917 --> 02:03:16,292
and will say he doesn't
know anything.

2225
02:03:17,083 --> 02:03:18,833
Let's play Prisoner's Dilemma,

2226
02:03:19,250 --> 02:03:20,250
Dynamo...?

2227
02:03:21,083 --> 02:03:22,000
Sir!?

2228
02:03:23,875 --> 02:03:25,125
Ok let that go.

2229
02:03:25,375 --> 02:03:27,125
Are you a good cop or a
bad cop in the game?

2230
02:03:27,333 --> 02:03:28,542
Definitely a bad cop.

2231
02:03:31,792 --> 02:03:32,875
What's up, Haram Singh?

2232
02:03:33,333 --> 02:03:34,042
Did you eat?

2233
02:03:34,958 --> 02:03:35,792
I had sir.

2234
02:03:36,958 --> 02:03:37,625
Hey.

2235
02:03:38,250 --> 02:03:40,167
Your group has got
educated people too?

2236
02:03:40,208 --> 02:03:41,125
I've studied till 10th grade.

2237
02:03:41,208 --> 02:03:43,125
-I'm working as VAO.
-What's the news?

2238
02:03:43,208 --> 02:03:44,375
Dinesh-Aishwarya...

2239
02:03:44,833 --> 02:03:45,750
...scandal.

2240
02:03:47,750 --> 02:03:48,458
And then,

2241
02:03:49,042 --> 02:03:50,542
Gulmaan-Zinta Scandal!

2242
02:03:51,083 --> 02:03:52,625
-Look at him laugh,
-What kinda girl is she?

2243
02:03:52,625 --> 02:03:54,458
may be he's worried about the
girls of this generation.

2244
02:03:55,375 --> 02:03:56,958
Do you only know to
read or can write too?

2245
02:03:58,125 --> 02:03:59,958
Give it to me, I'll write
and show it to you.

2246
02:04:00,083 --> 02:04:00,917
Come on write.

2247
02:04:01,750 --> 02:04:02,458
Let's see.

2248
02:04:02,792 --> 02:04:04,250
-What shall I write?
-News, News.

2249
02:04:04,292 --> 02:04:05,500
-News?!
-Gossip! Gossip!

2250
02:04:05,583 --> 02:04:06,208
Gossip!?

2251
02:04:06,208 --> 02:04:07,375
Yes write down, we'll see.

2252
02:04:16,333 --> 02:04:19,542
Haram Singh, turned as an approver,
confessing your murders and thefts.

2253
02:04:20,125 --> 02:04:21,833
Only based on that
we arrested you.

2254
02:04:22,500 --> 02:04:23,542
If you don't believe us.

2255
02:04:23,917 --> 02:04:25,458
These are the jewels,
you gave to Haram Singh.

2256
02:04:25,625 --> 02:04:26,500
Check them.

2257
02:04:32,917 --> 02:04:34,292
I'm innocent Sir.

2258
02:04:34,333 --> 02:04:36,625
-If you repeat that again...
-Sathya calm down.

2259
02:04:41,417 --> 02:04:44,125
Just answer this one question.

2260
02:04:44,750 --> 02:04:46,000
After 1996,

2261
02:04:46,458 --> 02:04:49,000
why didn't you guys come in
to Tamilnadu for 4 years?

2262
02:04:49,625 --> 02:04:50,542
I’ll give you money.

2263
02:04:51,417 --> 02:04:53,042
Also these jewels too.

2264
02:04:53,458 --> 02:04:54,167
If not,

2265
02:04:54,792 --> 02:04:55,625
Sathya.

2266
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:00,167
Why didn't you guys come
to Tamilnadu for 4 years?

2267
02:05:00,292 --> 02:05:01,000
Let us know.

2268
02:05:01,042 --> 02:05:02,375
If not we'll put you
down in encounter.

2269
02:05:02,417 --> 02:05:03,000
No Sir.

2270
02:05:04,958 --> 02:05:05,542
Sir.

2271
02:05:06,208 --> 02:05:07,167
From Agra,

2272
02:05:07,500 --> 02:05:08,917
while evading after a loot.

2273
02:05:09,500 --> 02:05:11,125
At the Sikandera check post,

2274
02:05:11,167 --> 02:05:14,167
shots were fired by the
Police present there.

2275
02:05:15,167 --> 02:05:16,917
We managed to escape from there,

2276
02:05:17,292 --> 02:05:19,125
but we were caught
again by the Police.

2277
02:05:19,125 --> 02:05:19,708
Nazeer!

2278
02:05:19,917 --> 02:05:21,250
While they were
evading after a loot,

2279
02:05:21,292 --> 02:05:24,417
they were nabbed at UP's Sikandra
Police and were convicted for 3 years.

2280
02:05:24,458 --> 02:05:26,958
They escaped after the bail,
while the case was still on.

2281
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:28,042
And were back in business.

2282
02:05:28,083 --> 02:05:29,833
Hey, who's your gang leader.

2283
02:05:29,958 --> 02:05:31,000
Tell me.

2284
02:05:33,375 --> 02:05:33,958
Speak up!

2285
02:05:33,958 --> 02:05:35,417
He already confessed Sathya.

2286
02:05:38,375 --> 02:05:39,917
Send our team to Sikandra,

2287
02:05:40,167 --> 02:05:41,625
and asked to check
their file of arrest.

2288
02:05:43,292 --> 02:05:44,917
That'll have everything we need.

2289
02:05:44,917 --> 02:05:45,792
Get in damn it.

2290
02:05:49,042 --> 02:05:49,833
Son!?

2291
02:05:50,625 --> 02:05:52,042
When did you get arrested?

2292
02:05:52,875 --> 02:05:55,500
You explicitly gave up
everything in writing.

2293
02:05:56,417 --> 02:05:57,792
When did I do that?

2294
02:05:58,542 --> 02:06:00,625
Hey, I only wrote gossip.

2295
02:06:01,583 --> 02:06:03,458
-Gossip uh!?
-Huh!

2296
02:06:03,500 --> 02:06:06,375
This is why I kept asking
you guys to study.

2297
02:06:06,417 --> 02:06:07,583
You foolish bunch.

2298
02:06:07,625 --> 02:06:08,625
Idiotic Fools!

2299
02:06:13,792 --> 02:06:14,833

02:08:41,083 --> 02:08:42,208
Go this way,

2340
02:08:42,250 --> 02:08:43,125
get to the other side.

2341
02:08:43,167 --> 02:08:45,167
Oh no!!!

2342
02:08:48,958 --> 02:08:50,958
Why did you guys come all the
way from North India to steal?

2343
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:51,542
Speak up!

2344
02:08:51,583 --> 02:08:52,875
Hit him Sir, hit him.

2345
02:08:53,042 --> 02:08:55,125
Our guys were getting
encountered in UP.

2346
02:08:55,167 --> 02:08:57,750
That's why our leader changed
the location to Madras.

2347
02:08:57,917 --> 02:08:58,708
Tell damn it.

2348
02:08:58,958 --> 02:09:00,833
Whenever we're blocked at
check post after a loot,

2349
02:09:00,875 --> 02:09:03,042
Twenty Rupees was enough to seal
the deal with Madras Police.

2350
02:09:04,792 --> 02:09:05,500
Keep talking!

2351
02:09:05,542 --> 02:09:07,167
If caught in UP,
Police shoots us down.

2352
02:09:07,167 --> 02:09:08,875
Your Police doesn't
even have a gun.

2353
02:09:08,917 --> 02:09:09,792
But we'll have one.

2354
02:09:09,833 --> 02:09:10,542
Then...

2355
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:12,167
Don't stop.

2356
02:09:12,875 --> 02:09:15,625
The women here wore
a lot of jewels.

2357
02:09:15,917 --> 02:09:19,583
That made us wonder, if they wear so
much, Imagine how much will be at home.

2358
02:09:19,917 --> 02:09:22,458
I asked my wife not to
wear a lot of jewels,

2359
02:09:22,542 --> 02:09:23,625
as it's dangerous.

2360
02:09:23,708 --> 02:09:25,417
one day we have to die,

2361
02:09:25,458 --> 02:09:27,458
if it's for gold,
there's no harm in it.

2362
02:09:35,750 --> 02:09:37,917
With the continuous
arrests made by our team,

2363
02:09:38,167 --> 02:09:40,542
Oma did something which
we never had expected.

2364
02:09:44,792 --> 02:09:48,167
He started killing everyone he
suspected of being informers.

2365
02:09:48,417 --> 02:09:50,250
Our main informer Pandit,

2366
02:09:50,250 --> 02:09:52,417
evaded the city, due
to the fear of death.

2367
02:09:52,500 --> 02:09:54,500
To other North Indian
Gangs like Oma's,

2368
02:09:54,625 --> 02:09:56,500
In order to fear the
Tamilnadu Police,

2369
02:09:56,542 --> 02:09:57,917
we took an aggressive decision.

2370
02:10:36,750 --> 02:10:38,625
After our streak of encounters,

2371
02:10:38,750 --> 02:10:40,625
Oma kept moving to new places.

2372
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:42,458
Take this.

2373
02:10:42,500 --> 02:10:44,167
File a case stating, he's
torturing the tribes,

2374
02:10:44,208 --> 02:10:46,083
or complaint to Human Rights.

2375
02:10:46,167 --> 02:10:47,958
I want that Madrasi out of here.

2376
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:48,917
Mangey Lal.

2377
02:10:51,625 --> 02:10:53,375
Come on dear, where are
you trying to escape?

2378
02:10:53,458 --> 02:10:55,542
Come on, come on, let's
take a tour of Chennai.

2379
02:10:55,542 --> 02:10:56,542
Sathya, drive.

2380
02:11:02,583 --> 02:11:05,042
Police from all the states,
started to help us.

2381
02:11:05,333 --> 02:11:06,708
With their help.

2382
02:11:06,750 --> 02:11:09,583
We confiscated the booty
looted by Oma's gang.

2383
02:11:10,792 --> 02:11:12,208
-Where's Oma?
-Where's Oma?

2384
02:11:12,250 --> 02:11:13,083
I'm innocent Sir.

2385
02:11:13,125 --> 02:11:14,375
-I'm innocent Sir.
-Speak up!

2386
02:11:14,500 --> 02:11:15,500
Tell us, where's Oma?

2387
02:11:15,542 --> 02:11:16,125
Speak up?

2388
02:11:17,333 --> 02:11:18,500
Where's Oma, say.

2389
02:11:18,542 --> 02:11:19,542
Where's Oma?

2390
02:11:19,750 --> 02:11:20,500
Speak up.

2391
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:22,750
Once we came know that
Oma is the gang leader,

2392
02:11:23,083 --> 02:11:24,958
that search went
on for 15 months.

2393
02:11:26,458 --> 02:11:28,500
It was 15 months, since
I saw Priya too.

2394
02:11:29,792 --> 02:11:33,250
Whenever I felt the guilt of not
being with Priya who's in coma.

2395
02:11:33,583 --> 02:11:35,583
I felt like quitting this job.

2396
02:11:36,458 --> 02:11:37,917
Whenever I get that feeling,

2397
02:11:38,625 --> 02:11:40,167
The ones I lost in my life,

2398
02:11:40,708 --> 02:11:43,333
flashes of those pleasant moments
with Priya will come to me.

2399
02:11:45,792 --> 02:11:48,833
Just like this,many families
dreams and happiness,

2400
02:11:49,083 --> 02:11:50,750
would've got tarnished
because of Oma.

2401
02:11:51,375 --> 02:11:52,708
Oma!

2402
02:11:53,125 --> 02:11:55,208
No matter where you're,
I'll come looking for you.

2403
02:12:02,042 --> 02:12:03,042
Brother.

2404
02:12:06,250 --> 02:12:09,792
Madras Police have arrested 6
and encountered 2 of them.

2405
02:12:10,208 --> 02:12:11,833
Eight trucks have been ceased.

2406
02:12:11,917 --> 02:12:13,333
In spite of our
Police investigating,

2407
02:12:13,417 --> 02:12:14,917
we're not able to find out who's
passing him the information,

2408
02:12:14,958 --> 02:12:16,625
and how he's able
to make arrests.

2409
02:12:16,625 --> 02:12:17,625
Bhora!

2410
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:19,750
We've been running.

2411
02:12:20,542 --> 02:12:22,042
But that Madrasi,

2412
02:12:22,875 --> 02:12:25,875
is calm and hunting us down.

2413
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:29,708
We...

2414
02:12:30,292 --> 02:12:32,167
We should stop running.

2415
02:12:33,042 --> 02:12:35,125
Are we going to be
the scapegoats,

2416
02:12:35,333 --> 02:12:37,458
or those Wolves which
demands sacrifices,

2417
02:12:37,625 --> 02:12:39,792
the time is here to
make that decision.

2418
02:12:40,375 --> 02:12:41,875
If we keep running,

2419
02:12:42,125 --> 02:12:43,625
then we can't call
ourselves hunters.

2420
02:12:43,750 --> 02:12:45,750
We'll turn in to
the hunted ones.

2421
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:55,083
Pass on a information stating, that I'm
escaping through Thalyat Hamira station.

2422
02:12:55,208 --> 02:12:58,083
No one should be able to find
that Madrasi's dead body.

2423
02:12:58,417 --> 02:13:01,167
I will chop him in to pieces and
feed to the Aravalli eagles.

2424
02:13:05,375 --> 02:13:07,375
Here on, no state Police should,

2425
02:13:07,500 --> 02:13:10,250
have the intention to
come looking for us.

2426
02:13:10,250 --> 02:13:11,125
Sure brother.

2427
02:13:13,792 --> 02:13:17,458
Inform the Madras Police that Oma
is escaping through Hamira Station.

2428
02:13:17,500 --> 02:13:19,250
-Hello.
-Sir!

2429
02:13:49,542 --> 02:13:51,042
-Son,
-Tell me Uncle.

2430
02:13:51,042 --> 02:13:52,333
They're saying she's critical.

2431
02:13:52,542 --> 02:13:54,250
Surgery has to be done.

2432
02:13:55,125 --> 02:13:57,333
I'm really scared Son.

2433
02:13:57,625 --> 02:13:59,042
Can you please come down?

2434
02:14:00,125 --> 02:14:01,875
That moment when I had to decide,
Should I go to see Priya?

2435
02:14:02,542 --> 02:14:05,375
Or I should go on
and catch Oma...

2436
02:14:09,208 --> 02:14:10,833
I left looking for Oma.

2437
02:14:11,542 --> 02:14:12,542
My Priya,

2438
02:14:13,250 --> 02:14:14,917
will be waiting for me.

2439
02:14:25,333 --> 02:14:26,292
Take positions.

2440
02:14:26,500 --> 02:14:27,042
Taken Sir.

2441
02:14:27,125 --> 02:14:28,125
Taken Sir.

2442
02:14:28,208 --> 02:14:29,208
In Position Sir.

2443
02:14:44,042 --> 02:14:45,208
Oma's gang is not here yet.

2444
02:14:51,333 --> 02:14:52,458
Boys, Alert...Alert!

2445
02:14:52,500 --> 02:14:53,500
Train is here.

2446
02:14:57,208 --> 02:14:59,292
Check both passengers,
getting in and out.

2447
02:14:59,417 --> 02:15:00,208
Ok Sir.

2448
02:15:15,042 --> 02:15:15,833
Oma isn't here.

2449
02:15:15,917 --> 02:15:16,250
He is not here.

2450
02:15:16,292 --> 02:15:17,542
There are chances of
him on train already.

2451
02:15:17,542 --> 02:15:18,958
Everyone get inside each
compartment and check.

2452
02:15:18,958 --> 02:15:19,958
Fast, Fast!

2453
02:15:29,208 --> 02:15:30,500
We're checking in
the Non-AC coaches.

2454
02:15:30,500 --> 02:15:31,667
-Hey!
-Ah!

2455
02:15:35,583 --> 02:15:36,667
Where do you think you're going?

2456
02:15:36,667 --> 02:15:37,667
What's the emergency?

2457
02:15:43,625 --> 02:15:44,083
Sir.

2458
02:15:52,250 --> 02:15:53,333
He is not there in
any of the coaches.

2459
02:15:53,667 --> 02:15:54,833
Excuse me!

2460
02:15:54,917 --> 02:15:55,792
He isn't here too.

2461
02:15:55,833 --> 02:15:56,542
Ok, Ok.

2462
02:15:58,333 --> 02:15:59,458
Nazeer, did you
check thoroughly?

2463
02:15:59,500 --> 02:16:01,167
We did Sir, he's not in
the last compartment too.

2464
02:16:01,167 --> 02:16:02,500
It's a wrong information then.

2465
02:16:02,542 --> 02:16:03,792
We'll get down at next station.

2466
02:16:16,292 --> 02:16:17,583
It's become a routine now,

2467
02:16:18,042 --> 02:16:21,167
They always pull the chain
and **** with the train.

2468
02:16:21,833 --> 02:16:23,250
Why did the train stop halfway?

2469
02:16:24,042 --> 02:16:26,333
There's someone climbing in
to the last compartment.

2470
02:16:26,375 --> 02:16:27,792
I'm on it Sir, come on go.

2471
02:16:31,750 --> 02:16:33,167
Nazeer, check immediately who
was it, I'm coming there.

2472
02:16:33,208 --> 02:16:34,417
Ok Sir, we're headed there.

2473
02:16:37,667 --> 02:16:38,792
Sir, the train is
leaving, get on it.

2474
02:16:38,833 --> 02:16:39,375
Get on the train.

2475
02:16:39,417 --> 02:16:40,417
The train is leaving Sir.

2476
02:16:40,875 --> 02:16:42,958
Nazeer the train is moving, I'm
climbing on a different compartment.

2477
02:16:43,000 --> 02:16:43,917
Did you check?

2478
02:16:46,333 --> 02:16:48,333
Sir, It's Oma's gang, please come soon.

2479
02:16:49,042 --> 02:16:52,417
I'm 2 compartments away, hold
him, will be there soon.

2480
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:12,542
-HEY!
-HEY!

2481
02:17:15,792 --> 02:17:16,750
Silence!

2482
02:17:16,833 --> 02:17:17,833
Run!

2483
02:17:19,292 --> 02:17:21,292
Side...side, side, side, side!

2484
02:17:21,375 --> 02:17:23,167
Sir that side, gun
shots are fired.

2485
02:17:23,167 --> 02:17:24,667
Public is running in panic.

2486
02:17:24,750 --> 02:17:26,042
Senthil is stuck inside.

2487
02:17:26,083 --> 02:17:27,458
Due to the crowd can't get in.

2488
02:17:27,500 --> 02:17:28,792
Make way.

2489
02:17:35,042 --> 02:17:36,042
OMA!

2490
02:17:41,458 --> 02:17:44,167
STOP THE TRAIN!

2491
02:17:45,833 --> 02:17:47,208
Get to the horses.

2492
02:18:41,583 --> 02:18:42,167
Sir.

2493
02:18:42,333 --> 02:18:45,417
There's a village on this
side, where shepherds live.

2494
02:18:45,458 --> 02:18:48,167
Beyond that is dry
land and mountains.

2495
02:18:48,167 --> 02:18:49,083
How many kilometers brother?

2496
02:18:49,125 --> 02:18:50,167
Two Kilometers.

2497
02:18:50,208 --> 02:18:51,083
Boys let's leave.

2498
02:18:51,542 --> 02:18:53,125
Oma wouldn't have gone too far.

2499
02:18:53,250 --> 02:18:54,250
If we follow can catch him.

2500
02:18:55,792 --> 02:18:57,125
He'll definitely kill me.

2501
02:18:57,208 --> 02:18:58,208
Everyone be alert.

2502
02:18:58,250 --> 02:18:59,333
Keep searching.

2503
02:19:00,375 --> 02:19:01,875
Wonder how far we'll
have to walk.

2504
02:19:10,083 --> 02:19:11,458
How many more
kilometers brother?

2505
02:19:11,542 --> 02:19:12,917
Two Kilometers.

2506
02:19:19,250 --> 02:19:20,292
Hey brother!

2507
02:19:20,458 --> 02:19:21,917
You said Two Kilometers,

2508
02:19:22,125 --> 02:19:23,333
it doesn't seem to end.

2509
02:19:24,667 --> 02:19:26,000
How many more kilometers?

2510
02:19:26,042 --> 02:19:27,042
Two Kilometers.

2511
02:19:27,083 --> 02:19:28,667
"Doh" means "2" right?

2512
02:19:28,875 --> 02:19:31,583
Not sure if it's him
or I don't understand.

2513
02:19:36,500 --> 02:19:38,333
How far do we have to go more?

2514
02:19:38,542 --> 02:19:39,750
Ask him.

2515
02:19:39,792 --> 02:19:41,500
You don't have to ask
him, I'll tell you,

2516
02:19:41,583 --> 02:19:42,750
It's Two Kilometers.

2517
02:19:42,833 --> 02:19:43,458
Come on.

2518
02:19:43,458 --> 02:19:45,417
Oh God, two more!

2519
02:19:45,792 --> 02:19:47,250
Not able to take it.

2520
02:20:19,292 --> 02:20:20,292
The village is here.

2521
02:20:20,500 --> 02:20:21,375
Come on, Come on!

2522
02:20:21,375 --> 02:20:22,958
Come on, quick.

2523
02:20:27,125 --> 02:20:28,792
I'm sure there will
be water there.

2524
02:21:02,583 --> 02:21:03,750
Why do you look troubled Sir?

2525
02:21:03,792 --> 02:21:05,542
Not sure with what courage,
I got the team here.

2526
02:21:06,417 --> 02:21:07,917
The fear of something
might happen to them,

2527
02:21:07,958 --> 02:21:09,125
has been troubling me.

2528
02:21:09,292 --> 02:21:10,458
Let's do a recce.

2529
02:21:10,750 --> 02:21:12,625
Make note of the entry and
the exit of the village.

2530
02:21:12,750 --> 02:21:13,333
Yes Sir.

2531
02:21:13,417 --> 02:21:15,000
They're calling this
a Ghost Village.

2532
02:21:15,083 --> 02:21:17,667
Only 4 families of the
Shepards are residing here.

2533
02:21:17,667 --> 02:21:19,500
I've made arrangements for
our dinner with them.

2534
02:21:19,542 --> 02:21:19,792
Ok.

2535
02:21:19,833 --> 02:21:21,333
We'll stay the night, and resume
our search in the morning.

2536
02:21:21,500 --> 02:21:23,792
They're in the village
as per our plan.

2537
02:21:24,417 --> 02:21:26,958
Let's attack now
and finish them.

2538
02:21:27,042 --> 02:21:27,667
No!

2539
02:21:27,833 --> 02:21:28,750
Let's wait.

2540
02:21:28,958 --> 02:21:30,750
Patience is really
important to a hunter.

2541
02:22:02,083 --> 02:22:03,208
"She's critical it seems..."

2542
02:22:04,583 --> 02:22:06,375
"I'm really scared, Son."

2543
02:22:18,583 --> 02:22:20,167
Grey Wolves!

2544
02:22:20,250 --> 02:22:23,208
Have taught us how
and when to hunt.

2545
02:22:23,375 --> 02:22:26,375
We'll go on horses and scatter
them with powder bombs.

2546
02:22:26,458 --> 02:22:28,042
You guys hide there,

2547
02:22:28,042 --> 02:22:31,000
and kill those who
are running in fear.

2548
02:22:31,333 --> 02:22:32,333
If you ask how?

2549
02:22:32,417 --> 02:22:35,208
just like how the Wolves hunt.

2550
02:22:47,500 --> 02:22:48,667
Jai Baouli!

2551
02:22:48,833 --> 02:22:50,500
Jai Baouli!

2552
02:22:50,792 --> 02:22:52,667
Jai Baouli!

2553
02:22:52,667 --> 02:22:54,583
Jai Baouli!

2554
02:23:04,500 --> 02:23:05,500
Dear!

2555
02:23:06,500 --> 02:23:08,583
Are you worried about me?

2556
02:23:09,958 --> 02:23:11,667
I'll be fine!

2557
02:23:14,750 --> 02:23:15,500
Sleep.

2558
02:23:17,000 --> 02:23:18,875
Sleep well on my lap.

2559
02:23:59,250 --> 02:24:00,125
ALERT!

2560
02:24:00,125 --> 02:24:02,458
Cover, Cover, ask
everyone to get in.

2561
02:24:02,500 --> 02:24:03,833
Run, Run, Run!

2562
02:24:03,875 --> 02:24:05,167
Hide, Hide! Hide, Hide!

2563
02:24:11,583 --> 02:24:12,750
Murugan!

2564
02:24:14,792 --> 02:24:16,125
Sethu, Nazeer come here.

2565
02:24:16,167 --> 02:24:17,167
Murugan! Murugan!

2566
02:24:17,167 --> 02:24:18,500
Lift him, lift him.

2567
02:24:19,917 --> 02:24:21,125
Ask the villagers to get in.

2568
02:24:21,167 --> 02:24:23,125
Don't be scared, it's
just a country gun.

2569
02:24:23,125 --> 02:24:24,042
It'll shoot only 20 feet.

2570
02:24:24,042 --> 02:24:25,875
And 10 feet is the killing
point, maintain the distance.

2571
02:24:25,917 --> 02:24:27,125
Everyone get to a vantage point.

2572
02:25:01,250 --> 02:25:02,250
Sir!

2573
02:25:04,833 --> 02:25:05,833
Sir!

2574
02:25:09,667 --> 02:25:11,625
There are two more
in front of me, Sir.

2575
02:25:12,583 --> 02:25:13,458
Oh God!

2576
02:25:20,208 --> 02:25:22,375
"The Hide 'n' Attack
technique of the Wolves."

2577
02:25:22,667 --> 02:25:24,000
"One chases, and
another hunts..."

2578
02:25:29,417 --> 02:25:30,167
Sathya come in.

2579
02:25:30,208 --> 02:25:30,833
They've killed Madhan.

2580
02:25:30,833 --> 02:25:31,750
Relax Sathya.

2581
02:25:31,833 --> 02:25:33,667
They're using the Wolves
trap techniques to attack.

2582
02:25:33,750 --> 02:25:34,917
We should take that
to our advantage.

2583
02:25:34,917 --> 02:25:35,917
What Should I do?

2584
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:37,542
Can you see a tower from you're?

2585
02:25:37,667 --> 02:25:38,917
I can see it Sir.

2586
02:25:39,167 --> 02:25:40,000
Jump.

2587
02:25:40,875 --> 02:25:41,958
Run towards it.

2588
02:26:05,167 --> 02:26:06,167
He's close Sir.

2589
02:26:10,500 --> 02:26:11,792
There are two more
running towards me.

2590
02:26:18,292 --> 02:26:20,542
OMA!

2591
02:26:28,792 --> 02:26:29,875
Khali!

2592
02:26:29,917 --> 02:26:31,250
-Vicky!?
-Sir!

2593
02:26:31,292 --> 02:26:32,667
-Jump.
-Yes Sir!

2594
02:26:33,583 --> 02:26:34,625
Turn to your right.

2595
02:26:35,958 --> 02:26:37,292
One of them is chasing me,

2596
02:26:37,292 --> 02:26:38,417
run straight towards me.

2597
02:26:43,667 --> 02:26:44,875
Two more in the front.

2598
02:26:53,542 --> 02:26:55,125
OMA!

2599
02:26:55,750 --> 02:26:56,917
Bhora!?

2600
02:26:56,958 --> 02:26:57,542
What happened!?

2601
02:26:57,583 --> 02:26:59,083
OMA!

2602
02:27:00,958 --> 02:27:02,375
OMA!

2603
02:27:04,958 --> 02:27:07,542
OMA!

2604
02:27:09,167 --> 02:27:10,125
Bhora!

2605
02:27:11,292 --> 02:27:12,042
Bhora!

2606
02:27:12,250 --> 02:27:13,500
What happened to our plan?

2607
02:27:13,667 --> 02:27:14,833
Where are our men?

2608
02:27:17,417 --> 02:27:18,625
Hey!

2609
02:27:23,458 --> 02:27:25,292
Boys, I've spotted Oma.

2610
02:27:25,292 --> 02:27:26,792
He's in the North East Corner.

2611
02:27:26,833 --> 02:27:27,542
Everyone round him up.

2612
02:27:27,542 --> 02:27:28,583
Careful, Careful!

2613
02:27:49,875 --> 02:27:51,875
Sir, Oma burnt the Sheep farm.

2614
02:27:51,875 --> 02:27:53,958
The smoke has covered it
all, nothing is visible.

2615
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:56,292
Sathya don't lose him, don't
lose him, try to cover him.

2616
02:27:56,333 --> 02:27:58,250
Don't let him move from
here, I'm coming there.

2617
02:27:59,583 --> 02:28:00,583
Khali!

2618
02:28:00,958 --> 02:28:02,542
Quickly get the horses.

2619
02:28:02,542 --> 02:28:03,417
I'm coming.

2620
02:28:07,500 --> 02:28:08,000
Let's Go!

2621
02:28:16,333 --> 02:28:17,958
Sathya, I've shot Khali dead.

2622
02:28:18,000 --> 02:28:19,250
But Oma, escaped.

2623
02:28:19,250 --> 02:28:20,542
Get me a horse.

2624
02:32:44,833 --> 02:32:45,417
Sir!

2625
02:32:46,167 --> 02:32:47,583
-Sir!?
-Huh!

2626
02:32:47,792 --> 02:32:49,167
Sorry to disturb you Sir.

2627
02:32:49,500 --> 02:32:50,917
I would like to meet you Sir.

2628
02:32:50,958 --> 02:32:51,792
Please Sir.

2629
02:32:51,917 --> 02:32:52,792
Come on Sunday.

2630
02:32:52,833 --> 02:32:53,833
Thank you Sir.

2631
02:32:59,542 --> 02:33:01,750
Since two months, I've been
asking to change this chair.

2632
02:33:02,042 --> 02:33:03,458
I've applied for it, Sir.

2633
02:33:05,583 --> 02:33:07,458
Why someone, who has dealt
with such a huge case,

2634
02:33:07,542 --> 02:33:09,250
is been given a dummy position.

2635
02:33:10,208 --> 02:33:11,833
If you're honest to
your Department.

2636
02:33:12,167 --> 02:33:13,750
You'll be rewarded
with such things.

2637
02:33:14,458 --> 02:33:16,167
But he gets them very often.

2638
02:33:18,792 --> 02:33:20,375
The highways are different now.

2639
02:33:20,667 --> 02:33:22,667
There's been development in
technology to catch the criminals.

2640
02:33:22,750 --> 02:33:24,208
But as far as that
case is concern,

2641
02:33:24,375 --> 02:33:26,667
the respect which was given
to the lives of authority,

2642
02:33:26,875 --> 02:33:28,292
if had given to the
common man too.

2643
02:33:28,458 --> 02:33:29,958
Many lives would've been spared.

2644
02:33:30,000 --> 02:33:31,667
Is it department's fault?

2645
02:33:31,917 --> 02:33:33,458
Or is it the authority who
governs the department?

2646
02:33:34,042 --> 02:33:37,208
Or is it the public, who elected the
Authority? It's an never ending topic.

2647
02:33:37,667 --> 02:33:39,083
Until we get an answer to this.

2648
02:33:39,250 --> 02:33:40,250
Crimes,

2649
02:33:40,292 --> 02:33:41,583
Death of innocent people,

2650

Two down in encounter.

2668
02:34:32,583 --> 02:34:38,583

imprisonment and severe punishment.
