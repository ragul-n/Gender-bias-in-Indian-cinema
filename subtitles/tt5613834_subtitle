1
00:01:08,201 --> 00:01:12,921
"When something is destined
to happen"

2
00:01:13,721 --> 00:01:18,281
"it happens at that time."

3
00:01:19,041 --> 00:01:23,761
"When something is destined
to happen"

4
00:01:24,401 --> 00:01:29,041
"it happens at that time."

5
00:01:29,361 --> 00:01:30,401
Hey..
- Hey!

6
00:01:30,921 --> 00:01:33,481
Come here.
- My car.

7
00:01:33,561 --> 00:01:34,921
Hey!
- It's his car!

8
00:01:35,441 --> 00:01:37,001
Stop..

9
00:01:40,401 --> 00:01:41,801
My car!

10
00:01:44,601 --> 00:01:47,321
If something is destined to happen,
it'll definitely happen.

11
00:01:47,361 --> 00:01:49,561
It might be a coincidence
or what the..

12
00:02:11,401 --> 00:02:12,361
One second.

13
00:02:12,801 --> 00:02:15,641
Can you make sure that you
get the whole thing? - Yes, sure.

14
00:02:21,681 --> 00:02:25,281
Congratulations, Mr. Gaurav.
You are now a proud owner.

15
00:02:25,361 --> 00:02:26,761
Thank you.
- Enjoy. - Thank you.

16
00:02:32,401 --> 00:02:34,881
Hi! I'm Gaurav.

17
00:02:36,561 --> 00:02:37,641
I just bought this house.

18
00:02:38,641 --> 00:02:39,801
My first house.

19
00:03:05,481 --> 00:03:08,001
'The forecast for today,
well the rain is..'

20
00:03:18,081 --> 00:03:19,721
Have a nice day.
- You too, officer.

21
00:03:29,921 --> 00:03:31,201
Hey, Gaurav.
- Hey, Brian.

22
00:03:31,241 --> 00:03:33,321
Hey, Gaurav. - Hey, Ryan.
- Hey, Gaurav. - Hey, Taylor.

23
00:03:33,441 --> 00:03:34,401
Hey, Gaurav.
- Hey, Nancy.

24
00:03:34,521 --> 00:03:37,241
Hold on a second. Hey, I overslept.
- Hey, how are you?

25
00:03:37,281 --> 00:03:38,761
Hey, Dikshit.
- Hey, Brian.

26
00:03:38,841 --> 00:03:39,961
Hey, Dikshit.
- Hey, Ryan.

27
00:03:40,241 --> 00:03:41,641
Hey, Dikshit.
- Hey, Taylor.

28
00:03:41,801 --> 00:03:43,841
Hey, Dikshit.
- Hi, Nancy.

29
00:03:47,841 --> 00:03:49,361
Hey, these guys will never learn.

30
00:03:50,241 --> 00:03:52,841
I should either change my name
or change my work place.

31
00:04:08,441 --> 00:04:09,561
Do you need any help, Diks?

32
00:04:10,961 --> 00:04:12,481
Did you really buy a house?

33
00:04:15,001 --> 00:04:16,721
Yes. I got the keys today morning.

34
00:04:17,321 --> 00:04:19,361
There's some work left in the patio
and basement, but nothing major.

35
00:04:19,401 --> 00:04:21,081
Will get the grill on Thursday
and the home theatre on Friday.

36
00:04:21,281 --> 00:04:23,121
I'm really excited
for the coming weekends.

37
00:04:24,921 --> 00:04:27,241
You are the world's
most depressing happy person.

38
00:04:28,361 --> 00:04:29,641
It was my childhood dream.

39
00:04:29,681 --> 00:04:32,041
This isn't a dream. In the real
world, it's called a nightmare.

40
00:04:32,441 --> 00:04:35,441
You know what the Americans say,
same shit, different day.

41
00:04:37,961 --> 00:04:40,081
I love this shit, Dikshit.

42
00:04:40,481 --> 00:04:42,521
Your life is going in reverse.

43
00:04:42,601 --> 00:04:44,281
You bought a house and minivan.

44
00:04:44,321 --> 00:04:45,441
All you need is a girl.

45
00:04:46,601 --> 00:04:48,961
Hey, I'm still talking to you and
here comes your dependent's call.

46
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:51,721
Did you forget to carry
the keys again? - No!

47
00:04:51,761 --> 00:04:53,401
Is your vehicle out of gas?
- No!

48
00:04:53,441 --> 00:04:54,241
So what is it?

49
00:04:55,641 --> 00:04:57,401
I'm at the police station.
- What?

50
00:04:57,921 --> 00:04:59,161
What have you done now?

51
00:04:59,561 --> 00:05:00,961
Nothing serious. Relax!
Nothing serious. Relax!

52
00:05:01,121 --> 00:05:03,081
I was in a hurry
and police came after me.

53
00:05:03,201 --> 00:05:06,041
Excuse me, ma'am. You're speeding.
Get out of the car now.

54
00:05:06,121 --> 00:05:07,841
Many people can listen..
Get out of my face!

55
00:05:07,921 --> 00:05:10,041
Kavya, keep quiet for some time.
I'm coming.

56
00:05:14,321 --> 00:05:15,321
Have a nice day, ma'am.

57
00:05:15,401 --> 00:05:17,401
I'm calling my lawyer
and suing you for harassment.

58
00:05:18,121 --> 00:05:19,081
And racism.

59
00:05:19,441 --> 00:05:20,841
I'm putting this on Twitter
right now.

60
00:05:20,881 --> 00:05:23,241
W-What's your name?
Oh, hashtag, racist Bob. - Kavya!

61
00:05:23,321 --> 00:05:25,441
Hashtag, brown is the new black.
- Kavya, keep quiet.

62
00:05:25,521 --> 00:05:27,321
Hashtag, down with the police.

63
00:05:27,841 --> 00:05:30,481
At what speed were you driving?
- 40.

64
00:05:30,801 --> 00:05:34,121
That's nominal.
- 40 over the speed limit. - What?

65
00:05:34,881 --> 00:05:36,321
And I even forgot my
driving licence at home.

66
00:05:36,401 --> 00:05:38,441
It doesn't mean that they have
to misbehave with me, Gaurav.

67
00:05:38,561 --> 00:05:40,521
Great! You break the rules
and they misbehave!

68
00:05:42,961 --> 00:05:44,881
Oh, my God!

69
00:05:45,801 --> 00:05:50,041
You sold your Mustang
and bought a tempo!

70
00:05:50,401 --> 00:05:53,361
No!
I-It's awesome.

71
00:05:53,441 --> 00:05:55,201
I mean this is the most
safest vehicle on the road.

72
00:05:55,681 --> 00:05:57,121
It has six airbags,
auto skid control

73
00:05:57,201 --> 00:05:58,521
and with a fuel efficiency
of 25 miles per gallon.

74
00:05:58,641 --> 00:06:00,161
I mean it's a complete family car.
I mean it's a complete family car.

75
00:06:01,321 --> 00:06:02,401
It has ample space.

76
00:06:02,961 --> 00:06:04,681
Four children
can play inside the car.

77
00:06:07,361 --> 00:06:09,481
I mean slowly even
you'll start to like it.

78
00:06:09,521 --> 00:06:11,801
You know it's like
A. R. Rahman's music.

79
00:06:11,841 --> 00:06:14,761
How can you spend all
your money for the house?

80
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:15,921
So according to you,
we can spend the money

81
00:06:15,961 --> 00:06:17,761
on the sports car
and fancy dresses. - Yes!

82
00:06:17,841 --> 00:06:19,401
But it's not about me,
it's about you.

83
00:06:20,481 --> 00:06:22,521
Lately, you are being weird.

84
00:06:22,561 --> 00:06:25,601
Neither you are married,
nor you have kids.

85
00:06:26,401 --> 00:06:27,761
But someday,
both are going to happen, right?

86
00:06:29,081 --> 00:06:31,121
You speak exactly like my dad.

87
00:06:32,161 --> 00:06:33,721
That's not a compliment.

88
00:06:35,121 --> 00:06:36,241
Fasten your seat belt.

89
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:55,321
Next time, you better take a cab.

90
00:06:57,641 --> 00:06:59,001
Okay, sorry.

91
00:06:59,441 --> 00:07:01,281
I didn't mean it.
I'm dropping you.
I didn't mean it.
I'm dropping you.

92
00:07:05,161 --> 00:07:06,841
You both look so cute together.

93
00:07:06,921 --> 00:07:08,361
You guys should be a couple.

94
00:07:09,201 --> 00:07:11,761
Please, Viji. We are just friends.
He's not my type.

95
00:07:11,801 --> 00:07:13,681
Why? What's the problem?

96
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:15,481
He's such a gentleman.

97
00:07:18,001 --> 00:07:19,881
Come on.

98
00:07:22,401 --> 00:07:23,641
Are you serious?

99
00:07:28,321 --> 00:07:30,841
His only flaw is that has no flaws.

100
00:07:30,921 --> 00:07:32,521
He is extra safe.

101
00:07:33,401 --> 00:07:34,961
Exactly like his minivan.

102
00:07:35,921 --> 00:07:37,401
I hope he was..

103
00:07:38,081 --> 00:07:40,521
You know, a little more..

104
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:49,081
Hey!

105
00:08:05,201 --> 00:08:06,641
Robbie, Sri,
come in.

106
00:08:07,561 --> 00:08:08,441
Hey!

107
00:08:08,881 --> 00:08:09,801
Raise your hands.

108
00:08:17,481 --> 00:08:19,681
Yakub, is the control room clear?
- Not yet.

109
00:08:38,641 --> 00:08:39,601
Now it's clear.

110
00:09:25,881 --> 00:09:27,281
Passage clear.
There's no one here.

111
00:09:27,641 --> 00:09:28,521
Be quick.

112
00:09:31,481 --> 00:09:33,161
Yakub, we are in.
- Copy.

113
00:09:35,201 --> 00:09:36,121
Painting.

114
00:09:47,961 --> 00:09:49,321
What documents are there in it?

115
00:09:50,561 --> 00:09:51,521
Do you have any idea?

116
00:09:52,721 --> 00:09:53,881
How many assignments
have we done together?

117
00:09:54,721 --> 00:09:56,281
Has Colonel ever told us earlier
that he'll tell us this time?

118
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:06,681
Shree, time's up.

119
00:10:07,321 --> 00:10:08,201
It's not possible.

120
00:10:08,761 --> 00:10:10,361
They have updated the system.

121
00:10:11,681 --> 00:10:12,721
Only two minutes
left for 12:00 a.m.

122
00:10:12,801 --> 00:10:13,841
And the Chinese are very punctual.

123
00:10:13,921 --> 00:10:15,041
Robbie, plan B.

124
00:10:19,881 --> 00:10:22,041
Simple surgical blast.

125
00:10:23,281 --> 00:10:24,681
It will open like a cork.

126
00:10:29,521 --> 00:10:30,401
Isn't it too much?

127
00:10:31,241 --> 00:10:33,041
No, it's not.
It's perfect.

128
00:10:33,481 --> 00:10:34,841
It will blast with a boom.

129
00:10:58,521 --> 00:10:59,721
They don't even respect me.

130
00:11:19,281 --> 00:11:21,201
Look, your cork has opened.

131
00:11:24,761 --> 00:11:26,161
Find him.

132
00:11:26,321 --> 00:11:27,801
Let's go.
The party is over, guys.

133
00:11:30,041 --> 00:11:32,081
You guys secure the package,
while I cover. - Okay.

134
00:11:37,081 --> 00:11:38,801
Over here..

135
00:11:39,081 --> 00:11:41,121
Over here..

136
00:11:49,361 --> 00:11:50,921
Rishi, where are you?

137
00:11:55,721 --> 00:11:57,361
I'm over here.
- Come on, let's go.

138
00:12:01,881 --> 00:12:02,961
Let's go.
- The package is secure.

139
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:38,561
To whom?
- Yakub, the doctor.

140
00:12:46,561 --> 00:12:47,601
We need to split.

141
00:14:59,721 --> 00:15:02,041
Rishi, come in.
Rishi..
Rishi, come in.
Rishi..

142
00:15:02,321 --> 00:15:03,441
Rishi, are you okay?

143
00:15:04,281 --> 00:15:05,361
My life's a mess.

144
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:15,201
All good!

145
00:15:16,321 --> 00:15:18,361
Are you hurt?
- Yes.

146
00:15:27,121 --> 00:15:29,321
Yakub, are you out of your mind?

147
00:15:29,521 --> 00:15:30,521
That moron saw everything.

148
00:15:30,601 --> 00:15:31,921
He saw our faces
as well as the vehicle.

149
00:15:32,001 --> 00:15:33,161
They could have
tracked us easily.

150
00:15:33,241 --> 00:15:34,401
By then,
we would have escaped from here.

151
00:15:34,761 --> 00:15:35,881
He was a simple civilian.

152
00:15:36,201 --> 00:15:37,801
These are the Colonel's rules,
not mine.

153
00:15:38,241 --> 00:15:39,481
Collateral damage does take place.

154
00:15:40,081 --> 00:15:43,121
Why are you overreacting?
It's not the first time.

155
00:15:44,361 --> 00:15:46,001
This isn't right.
- Really!

156
00:15:53,601 --> 00:15:54,721
It's nothing personal.

157
00:16:14,601 --> 00:16:16,401
What happened
in the Chinese Embassy, Colonel?

158
00:16:16,961 --> 00:16:18,961
I could clearly see Unit X's
involvement in the matter.

159
00:16:19,241 --> 00:16:21,921
Is it just your suspicion
or there's evidence as well?

160
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:24,641
It is because I never leave
behind any evidence. Never.

161
00:16:24,721 --> 00:16:27,441
The lesser you know,
the better it is.

162
00:16:27,521 --> 00:16:30,401
Moreover, let me run my unit.

163
00:16:31,361 --> 00:16:34,361
This unit doesn't belong to you.
It is created by the NSE.

164
00:16:34,441 --> 00:16:36,961
And without their permission..
- What permission do I need?

165
00:16:37,081 --> 00:16:38,001
This unit belongs to me.

166
00:16:38,681 --> 00:16:42,001
I am the one who selected,
recruited and trained the boys.

167
00:16:42,121 --> 00:16:44,521
They are ready to give up
on their lives on every mission.

168
00:16:44,601 --> 00:16:47,881
Not for you or NSE,
but for me.

169
00:16:48,961 --> 00:16:52,041
Do you think that I'm unaware
of you funding the arms dealers?

170
00:16:53,681 --> 00:16:54,881
I am calling off Unit X.

171
00:16:55,521 --> 00:16:57,361
This would be my last order
before I retire.

172
00:16:57,721 --> 00:16:59,801
Close all the operations
with immediate effect.

173
00:16:59,881 --> 00:17:02,761
You are quitting your job
as well your friendship with me!
You are quitting your job
as well your friendship with me!

174
00:17:06,561 --> 00:17:07,401
It's fine.

175
00:17:09,201 --> 00:17:10,241
It's your way.

176
00:17:15,521 --> 00:17:16,321
Go.

177
00:17:28,801 --> 00:17:29,641
I am sorry.

178
00:17:32,961 --> 00:17:34,081
Clean this up.
- Yes, Colonel.

179
00:17:36,921 --> 00:17:39,801
Mr. Jindal, you will be the one
to receive the arms deal.

180
00:17:40,321 --> 00:17:42,681
What about the Chinese?
- The Chinese won't harass you.

181
00:17:42,921 --> 00:17:45,561
Thank you, Colonel.
You will get your share.

182
00:17:45,801 --> 00:17:46,881
Good.

183
00:18:10,721 --> 00:18:14,281
'A Chinese company has withdrawn
its name from the arms deal.'

184
00:18:14,401 --> 00:18:16,441
'An Indian arms manufacturing
company'

185
00:18:16,521 --> 00:18:18,801
'General Corporation
will seal the deal.'

186
00:18:34,201 --> 00:18:36,041
A big congratulations
to all of you.

187
00:18:36,561 --> 00:18:38,881
A wonderful work
by our tech team. - Yes..

188
00:18:40,441 --> 00:18:43,041
You did a great job.
The sales team, especially Gaurav.

189
00:18:43,121 --> 00:18:44,881
Next time we would need someone
to go to India

190
00:18:44,961 --> 00:18:46,041
and close the deal.
- Thank you.

191
00:18:46,241 --> 00:18:48,681
Jim, it was kind of you.
Thank you. Thank you, everybody.

192
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,961
You know, I would actually
be more than happy to go to India

193
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:52,321
and close this deal for us.

194
00:18:52,401 --> 00:18:53,921
Thanks. That's great, Willy.

195
00:18:54,001 --> 00:18:55,961
We all know what a hell
of a team player you are.

196
00:18:56,201 --> 00:18:58,081
All right. Listen, everybody.
Now, get back to work.

197
00:18:58,201 --> 00:18:59,081
We have a lot to do.
- Hey..

198
00:18:59,161 --> 00:19:01,441
We have to transmission
the product to the India office.
We have to transmission
the product to the India office.

199
00:19:01,881 --> 00:19:03,281
So, let's get moving.
Shall we?

200
00:19:03,521 --> 00:19:05,481
Where is Willy from?
- Meerut.

201
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:06,721
Wasn't he going there
for a vacation?

202
00:19:07,081 --> 00:19:09,601
If you let Willy to take credit
for your hard work

203
00:19:09,681 --> 00:19:12,961
I swear I won't
let you live peacefully.

204
00:19:13,881 --> 00:19:15,121
Got it, Mr. Nice guy?

205
00:19:18,441 --> 00:19:19,521
That was so cute.

206
00:19:19,841 --> 00:19:22,001
She said that she won't
let you live peacefully.

207
00:19:22,721 --> 00:19:23,761
She won't kiss you.

208
00:19:25,601 --> 00:19:27,601
Willy is very cunning.

209
00:19:27,801 --> 00:19:29,281
Once, he took credit
for my work as well.

210
00:19:29,561 --> 00:19:31,361
He took credit for your work!
- Yes. - What was it about?

211
00:19:31,441 --> 00:19:33,121
Once, boss's car got stuck
in the parking.

212
00:19:33,401 --> 00:19:35,521
I took a reverse
and parked it smoothly.

213
00:19:35,721 --> 00:19:37,641
Willy went
and took credit for it.

214
00:19:37,881 --> 00:19:39,601
He took credit
for parking the car.

215
00:19:40,001 --> 00:19:43,721
I am telling you. The attitude
of such natives will never change.

216
00:19:43,801 --> 00:19:46,321
Natives! - Yes.
- What are you then, Dixit?

217
00:19:46,401 --> 00:19:47,361
I am American, dude.

218
00:19:47,401 --> 00:19:50,121
You told me yesterday that
you don't like America.

219
00:19:50,521 --> 00:19:52,241
Mr. Patel, focus on the hot dog.

220
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:53,801
Who will put sauce on it,
Mrs. Kokila?

221
00:19:54,561 --> 00:19:55,601
Sorry, ma'am.

222
00:19:56,881 --> 00:19:58,361
You will go to India
and finalise the deal.

223
00:19:58,441 --> 00:20:01,001
No, I won't go to India.
I am happy here.
No, I won't go to India.
I am happy here.

224
00:20:01,841 --> 00:20:04,121
In fact, I have plans.

225
00:20:08,641 --> 00:20:11,161
Hey, what's up? - Hi, Kavya!
- Hi, Gaurav.

226
00:20:13,441 --> 00:20:14,361
Kavya..

227
00:20:15,201 --> 00:20:17,761
I was thinking if we can
have dinner together tonight.

228
00:20:17,881 --> 00:20:20,921
Yes, sure! I'll be home,
let's watch Netflix and chill.

229
00:20:21,001 --> 00:20:24,921
No, I was thinking..
- But Chinese tonight, okay?

230
00:20:25,001 --> 00:20:27,201
Oh! Do we have beer at home?
- No.

231
00:20:27,361 --> 00:20:30,321
I mean let's do something
special tonight.

232
00:20:31,481 --> 00:20:33,321
How about we go to Cipriani?

233
00:20:36,361 --> 00:20:37,361
Oh!

234
00:20:38,001 --> 00:20:39,281
9:00 p.m. then?

235
00:20:40,921 --> 00:20:45,281
Okay. - Great. See you.
Goodnight. I mean, in the night.

236
00:20:45,601 --> 00:20:46,641
Bye.

237
00:20:47,681 --> 00:20:48,801
Shit!

238
00:20:49,601 --> 00:20:52,361
Don't get married
in the first date. Okay?

239
00:20:52,641 --> 00:20:53,521
Take it easy.

240
00:20:54,561 --> 00:20:55,961
Viji!
- Yes?

241
00:20:56,121 --> 00:20:58,441
Gaurav is taking me out to Cipriani
for dinner.

242
00:20:58,801 --> 00:21:00,721
Oh!
- What?
Oh!
- What?

243
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:02,841
That place is famous
for proposals.

244
00:21:12,001 --> 00:21:14,121
I don't want to settle with anyone.

245
00:21:14,641 --> 00:21:16,001
I just feel like he is..

246
00:21:16,761 --> 00:21:19,081
Oh! - He won't propose
on the first date.

247
00:21:19,161 --> 00:21:21,561
Not proposal,
he is dressed up for the wedding.

248
00:21:21,681 --> 00:21:24,041
Gelled hair,
fancy jacket, roses!

249
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:25,561
I am not going.

250
00:21:28,561 --> 00:21:31,441
I hope that you are wearing
something nice. - Yes, right!

251
00:21:32,481 --> 00:21:34,081
Anyway, pray for me.

252
00:21:35,641 --> 00:21:36,521
Hi!

253
00:21:46,841 --> 00:21:49,961
Was there any traffic?
- No! - Good.

254
00:21:51,481 --> 00:21:52,641
You're looking really nice.

255
00:21:54,921 --> 00:21:55,881
Cool.

256
00:21:58,681 --> 00:22:00,801
You too.
- Thanks.
You too.
- Thanks.

257
00:22:00,961 --> 00:22:02,481
Should I get the champagne now,
sir?

258
00:22:02,561 --> 00:22:03,481
No.
- Yes!

259
00:22:10,001 --> 00:22:10,881
Kavya..

260
00:22:12,521 --> 00:22:14,201
I was thinking..
- These are nice!

261
00:22:16,241 --> 00:22:18,641
Kavya. Both of us..

262
00:22:21,641 --> 00:22:23,281
Are you okay?
- Yes!

263
00:22:30,601 --> 00:22:31,521
Kavya.

264
00:22:34,361 --> 00:22:37,201
No.. Gaurav, don't do this,
please.

265
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:39,041
Don't do this. Stand up, please.

266
00:22:40,041 --> 00:22:41,441
Stand up, please.

267
00:22:46,841 --> 00:22:48,441
Spoon.
- What?

268
00:22:48,881 --> 00:22:50,241
I dropped my spoon.

269
00:22:52,001 --> 00:22:53,921
Oh! The spoon.
- Yes.

270
00:22:56,561 --> 00:23:00,161
W-Why are you so tense?
W-Why are you so tense?

271
00:23:00,241 --> 00:23:03,121
I thought that you..
- What? Me what?

272
00:23:03,201 --> 00:23:04,441
Nothing.

273
00:23:06,121 --> 00:23:07,161
Where are our menus?

274
00:23:07,241 --> 00:23:08,481
Your champagne, sir.

275
00:23:09,881 --> 00:23:11,121
I'm starving.

276
00:23:11,721 --> 00:23:12,921
I am so hungry.

277
00:23:18,481 --> 00:23:20,321
Cheers! Oh!

278
00:23:21,361 --> 00:23:22,281
Excuse me.

279
00:23:31,481 --> 00:23:34,201
Shit! But at least
you weren't insulted.

280
00:23:34,321 --> 00:23:35,721
I am insulted, Dikshit.

281
00:23:36,041 --> 00:23:39,641
Just a little bit. And Kavya
doesn't even know about it.

282
00:23:39,841 --> 00:23:40,641
Which is great!

283
00:23:40,761 --> 00:23:42,681
Given the situation.
And look at the bright side.

284
00:23:42,761 --> 00:23:44,481
You got your answer
without even questioning.

285
00:23:45,321 --> 00:23:46,881
Sometimes, people get into trouble
by just questioning.

286
00:23:46,961 --> 00:23:50,441
Dikshit, come and watch TV.
- Coming!

287
00:23:52,161 --> 00:23:54,641
I'm leaving now. It's time.

288
00:23:55,441 --> 00:23:56,561
Bye.

289
00:23:58,801 --> 00:24:02,241
These assignments, guns, blood.
What are we doing?
These assignments, guns, blood.
What are we doing?

290
00:24:02,361 --> 00:24:04,121
And for whom?
- For the nation.

291
00:24:04,201 --> 00:24:05,601
Who else?
- Are you sure?

292
00:24:06,161 --> 00:24:08,681
We do all the tasks assigned by the
Colonel without even questioning.

293
00:24:08,801 --> 00:24:10,921
Government changes,
politicians change

294
00:24:11,001 --> 00:24:13,841
country's enemies are now
friends, but we are still here.

295
00:24:14,281 --> 00:24:15,961
Has anyone thought what's
right and what's wrong?

296
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:18,161
That's Colonel's job.

297
00:24:18,721 --> 00:24:20,401
Ours is to do the task.

298
00:24:20,481 --> 00:24:22,561
And what about the innocents
being killed?

299
00:24:23,121 --> 00:24:24,121
What about them?

300
00:24:24,961 --> 00:24:27,441
What? Are you responsible
for the entire world?

301
00:24:27,641 --> 00:24:29,401
You always act as per
your whims and fancies!

302
00:24:30,201 --> 00:24:31,321
Be calm.

303
00:24:50,601 --> 00:24:53,881
I want more from life.
Someone in love with me.

304
00:24:54,001 --> 00:24:55,201
Someone I can fall in love with.

305
00:24:55,521 --> 00:24:59,521
A family. A beautiful house.
A garden. A tree in the garden.

306
00:24:59,601 --> 00:25:00,961
And a dog running
around the tree and..
And a dog running
around the tree and..

307
00:25:01,081 --> 00:25:03,401
And your kids behind the dog.

308
00:25:03,921 --> 00:25:05,681
How many times will
you repeat this?

309
00:25:43,601 --> 00:25:45,281
Hey, Rishi!

310
00:25:46,161 --> 00:25:49,121
Come.. Let's have a drink.
Come on.

311
00:25:52,521 --> 00:25:53,561
Here's your drink.

312
00:26:01,401 --> 00:26:03,161
You do know why I'm here, right?

313
00:26:04,161 --> 00:26:07,361
Of course! And even you know

314
00:26:08,001 --> 00:26:10,201
how much I have invested on you.

315
00:26:10,281 --> 00:26:12,241
14 years.
I've been doing only this.

316
00:26:12,321 --> 00:26:14,361
And you still want to leave, Rishi!

317
00:26:14,961 --> 00:26:17,641
I can't do this anymore.
I was never an agent.

318
00:26:18,001 --> 00:26:20,321
I hate myself.
I can't sleep at night.

319
00:26:20,401 --> 00:26:21,561
Can't forget about the ones
who died.

320
00:26:21,641 --> 00:26:23,881
Along with the criminal,
even the innocent gets punished.

321
00:26:23,961 --> 00:26:25,441
Why don't you understand?

322
00:26:25,521 --> 00:26:27,681
This country needs agents like you.

323
00:26:27,761 --> 00:26:29,481
I have done enough for the country
and you know that too.

324
00:26:30,401 --> 00:26:33,081
I just want to lead a
normal life. - You know what?

325
00:26:33,161 --> 00:26:35,601
Do this. Take a break.

326
00:26:36,641 --> 00:26:38,441
Go on a vacation. Best!

327
00:26:38,521 --> 00:26:39,961
Colonel.
- Yes?

328
00:26:42,001 --> 00:26:45,441
I am quitting.
- No, Rishi.

329
00:26:46,081 --> 00:26:47,401
And that's an order.

330
00:26:49,281 --> 00:26:50,561
No more orders, Colonel.

331
00:26:52,081 --> 00:26:55,201
Rishi..

332
00:26:56,761 --> 00:26:57,801
Rishi!

333
00:26:59,841 --> 00:27:01,561
"Who's your daddy now?"
"Who's your daddy now?"

334
00:27:05,841 --> 00:27:08,401
"W-Who's your daddy now?"
- Oh, my.. What was that?

335
00:27:08,481 --> 00:27:10,041
"Come on, baby.
Show me you can handle this."

336
00:27:10,121 --> 00:27:11,681
"Baby, I am little bit scandalous."

337
00:27:11,761 --> 00:27:13,361
"Let me take you up.
You are so glamorous."

338
00:27:13,441 --> 00:27:15,441
"Yes! Who's your daddy now?"
- This guy..

339
00:27:15,521 --> 00:27:17,201
Willy will definitely
get Kavya today.

340
00:27:18,081 --> 00:27:20,041
Don't talk disgusting
about your sister-in-law.

341
00:27:20,201 --> 00:27:22,801
Willy isn't my brother.
You should marry her first.

342
00:27:23,401 --> 00:27:25,041
Look at his eyes.
It's filled with desire.

343
00:27:25,161 --> 00:27:27,761
"Yes!" - Look at his energy.
Looks like he is in heat.

344
00:27:27,841 --> 00:27:29,241
Dikshit, you are my friend,
right? - "Who's your daddy now?"

345
00:27:29,321 --> 00:27:30,641
I am your friend
and that's why I am telling you.

346
00:27:30,721 --> 00:27:32,321
Go handle the situation
before you lose the girl.

347
00:27:32,401 --> 00:27:34,561
Shit!
Not again, man!

348
00:27:34,921 --> 00:27:37,081
But I don't know any English songs.

349
00:27:37,161 --> 00:27:38,041
"Show me you can handle this."

350
00:27:38,121 --> 00:27:41,241
Love has no language.

351
00:27:41,601 --> 00:27:43,641
You just feel it. Go, do it!
- "Who's your daddy now?"

352
00:27:44,081 --> 00:27:44,921
Go.

353
00:27:54,961 --> 00:27:58,641
"The way we need to breathe.."

354
00:27:59,361 --> 00:28:03,241
"The way we need to breathe"
"The way we need to breathe"

355
00:28:03,361 --> 00:28:05,641
"to survive."

356
00:28:06,001 --> 00:28:12,241
"I just need a girl to love."

357
00:28:14,881 --> 00:28:18,761
"I just need a girl.."

358
00:28:24,241 --> 00:28:25,521
What a bloody loser!

359
00:28:29,121 --> 00:28:32,001
We are dead.
We can't do anything now.

360
00:28:32,081 --> 00:28:33,201
Oh, man!

361
00:28:37,401 --> 00:28:41,721
"Oh, you moon-faced girl,
every time I see you"

362
00:28:41,801 --> 00:28:46,401
"I fall in love with you like
I saw you for the first time."

363
00:28:46,641 --> 00:28:50,601
"Oh, you moon-faced girl,
every time I see you"

364
00:28:50,681 --> 00:28:55,241
"I fall in love with you like
I saw you for the first time."

365
00:29:13,081 --> 00:29:15,281
"Your entry was so stunning"

366
00:29:15,361 --> 00:29:17,241
"you shook the entire nation."

367
00:29:17,321 --> 00:29:19,641
"You made an impact in my heart"

368
00:29:19,721 --> 00:29:21,561
"since I locked eyes with you."

369
00:29:22,201 --> 00:29:24,161
"You are very cute."

370
00:29:24,241 --> 00:29:26,121
"You are the result
of my good deeds."

371
00:29:26,201 --> 00:29:28,361
"Is there a heaven on Earth"

372
00:29:28,441 --> 00:29:30,401
"where you fell from?"

373
00:29:30,481 --> 00:29:32,521
"People gossip
about me everywhere."

374
00:29:32,601 --> 00:29:34,761
"You are the only
one unaware of it."

375
00:29:34,841 --> 00:29:39,121
"I screamed,
but you never looked back."

376
00:29:39,201 --> 00:29:41,281
"Did not look back."

377
00:29:41,761 --> 00:29:45,921
"Oh, you moon-faced girl,
every time I see you"

378
00:29:46,081 --> 00:29:50,561
"I fall in love with you like
I saw you for the first time."

379
00:29:50,841 --> 00:29:54,841
"Oh, you moon-faced girl,
every time I see you"

380
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:59,521
"I fall in love with you like
I saw you for the first time."

381
00:30:17,481 --> 00:30:19,121
"I don't care if you love me."

382
00:30:19,721 --> 00:30:21,401
"You know you don't deserve me."

383
00:30:22,001 --> 00:30:23,961
"You do your thing.
I'll do my thing."

384
00:30:24,041 --> 00:30:25,681
"Because you are
not coming with me."

385
00:30:26,401 --> 00:30:29,081
"Don't follow me. I fly solo."

386
00:30:29,161 --> 00:30:30,681
"I don't need nobody."

387
00:30:30,801 --> 00:30:33,481
"Enjoy your life.
Just relax."

388
00:30:33,561 --> 00:30:37,441
"I'm not your honey.
- Your tantrums are very cute."

389
00:30:37,521 --> 00:30:39,641
"I feel they are sexy."

390
00:30:39,721 --> 00:30:43,881
"All boys fall for you."

391
00:30:44,081 --> 00:30:46,361
"You look beautiful.
- Really!"

392
00:30:46,441 --> 00:30:48,481
"I fell for you in one look.
- What's up!"

393
00:30:48,561 --> 00:30:52,441
"How shall I explain
where your dreams take me?"

394
00:30:52,521 --> 00:30:54,481
"I have been eyeing
you for so long!"

395
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:56,721
"You are my eye candy."

396
00:30:56,881 --> 00:31:01,121
"But have you ever given me
anything worth even a penny?"
"But have you ever given me
anything worth even a penny?"

397
00:31:01,281 --> 00:31:03,201
"Even a penny!"

398
00:31:03,721 --> 00:31:07,841
"Oh, you moon-faced girl,
every time I see you"

399
00:31:08,041 --> 00:31:12,441
"I fall in love with you like
I saw you for the first time."

400
00:31:22,201 --> 00:31:23,321
"Who is your daddy now?"

401
00:32:15,961 --> 00:32:16,801
Who are you?

402
00:32:18,161 --> 00:32:20,721
Hey! I am being lenient with you.
Tell me.

403
00:32:20,801 --> 00:32:23,961
Rishi, relax..
It's okay..

404
00:32:24,761 --> 00:32:27,761
I am Ramchandra Rao.
Deputy Director, NSC.

405
00:32:28,241 --> 00:32:30,321
We only want to talk
to you for two minutes.

406
00:32:35,121 --> 00:32:35,961
What do you want?

407
00:32:36,041 --> 00:32:37,961
Colonel.
- Who?

408
00:32:38,401 --> 00:32:40,481
The team from which
you took retirement.

409
00:32:40,841 --> 00:32:42,521
When you know that
I've taken a retirement

410
00:32:42,881 --> 00:32:44,081
why are you ruining my holiday?

411
00:32:44,281 --> 00:32:46,601
Weren't you the team leader
of the Chinese Embassy Operation?

412
00:32:47,881 --> 00:32:49,841
Did you think you were
fighting for our country?

413
00:32:50,401 --> 00:32:53,521
Unit X have run many covet
operations for the country.

414
00:32:53,921 --> 00:32:55,041
But not anymore.

415
00:32:55,281 --> 00:32:57,561
Last few operations were not
carried out with NSC's approval.

416
00:32:57,721 --> 00:32:59,121
As soon as you passed
the information

417
00:32:59,201 --> 00:33:01,721
Colonel's friend, Jindal,
got two arms' deal.
Colonel's friend, Jindal,
got two arms' deal.

418
00:33:02,481 --> 00:33:04,001
This was a fake operation.

419
00:33:05,761 --> 00:33:07,961
You were only funding the colonel,
Rishi.

420
00:33:08,921 --> 00:33:11,841
If you didn't know this before,
you know now.

421
00:33:14,441 --> 00:33:16,241
You should follow them when
you have so much information.

422
00:33:17,281 --> 00:33:18,401
Don't waste your time on me.

423
00:33:18,481 --> 00:33:21,761
We don't have evidence.
We need your help.

424
00:33:23,761 --> 00:33:26,321
As you said earlier,
I am retired.

425
00:33:26,721 --> 00:33:28,441
I have nothing to do with this.

426
00:33:29,761 --> 00:33:30,561
Good luck!

427
00:33:32,521 --> 00:33:35,401
Do you think the colonel
will you let you get away?

428
00:33:36,761 --> 00:33:37,601
Never!

429
00:35:02,441 --> 00:35:04,641
Damn it! What fake
bomb have they planted?

430
00:35:20,521 --> 00:35:22,481
'The wind is strong, Dinkar Rao.'

431
00:35:22,561 --> 00:35:23,961
'Mind your hat.'

432
00:35:32,561 --> 00:35:34,481
"Come here, Kathrina.
- No, I won't."

433
00:35:34,561 --> 00:35:38,241
"I'll take you to Byculla
and then to Mahim. - No.."

434
00:35:38,321 --> 00:35:40,121
"From Mahim I'll take
you to Bandra.."

435
00:35:41,281 --> 00:35:42,441
Hey, Rishi!

436
00:35:43,921 --> 00:35:45,601
I was waiting for you.

437
00:35:47,041 --> 00:35:48,881
If you want to attack,
do it upfront.

438
00:35:49,361 --> 00:35:50,881
That way,
you'll at least have my respect.

439
00:35:51,841 --> 00:35:54,401
I would have killed you
if I wanted to.

440
00:35:54,801 --> 00:35:56,761
I wouldn't send
one man to kill you.

441
00:35:57,801 --> 00:36:01,161
Come. I was sure that
you would return alive.
Come. I was sure that
you would return alive.

442
00:36:01,641 --> 00:36:03,601
I know you better than
you know yourself, Rishi.

443
00:36:04,561 --> 00:36:05,441
What do you want?

444
00:36:05,801 --> 00:36:07,881
You had asked the same thing
when we met the first time.

445
00:36:08,321 --> 00:36:10,721
Only the way you asked
has changed over the time.

446
00:36:11,361 --> 00:36:13,481
I have already told you that I
want to leave this line of work.

447
00:36:15,921 --> 00:36:16,961
Thank you, everyone.

448
00:36:20,161 --> 00:36:21,721
Do not forget where you come from

449
00:36:22,561 --> 00:36:23,801
and who made you.

450
00:36:24,721 --> 00:36:26,761
You will never how
difficult it is for me

451
00:36:27,601 --> 00:36:28,561
to let you go.

452
00:36:29,601 --> 00:36:31,561
You want to leave
because you have reformed.

453
00:36:32,601 --> 00:36:33,441
Go.

454
00:36:35,001 --> 00:36:39,761
This is your last
assignment before you leave.

455
00:36:41,401 --> 00:36:42,401
Will you do it for me?

456
00:36:42,641 --> 00:36:43,841
The mission will be in Mumbai.

457
00:36:44,001 --> 00:36:46,561
You can go wherever
you want after that.

458
00:36:57,641 --> 00:36:59,641
Hi, guys.
It's time to close the deal.

459
00:36:59,721 --> 00:37:01,201
And, Gaurav,
I think you are the best person
And, Gaurav,
I think you are the best person

460
00:37:01,281 --> 00:37:02,561
to go to India and finish the job.

461
00:37:02,801 --> 00:37:04,481
Who? Me?
- Yes, you.

462
00:37:04,561 --> 00:37:07,561
No, Jim. I don't like to travel.
I get very stressed out.

463
00:37:07,761 --> 00:37:10,721
I puke a lot. I experience jet lag.
W-What if I fall sick?

464
00:37:10,801 --> 00:37:11,921
I just bought a new house.

465
00:37:12,601 --> 00:37:13,961
Anyway,
you should send a programmer.

466
00:37:14,041 --> 00:37:15,121
I don't know anything about coding.

467
00:37:15,201 --> 00:37:17,561
You are great with people and I am
not taking no for an answer.

468
00:37:18,321 --> 00:37:20,401
You are going to Mumbai
and that's final.

469
00:37:23,761 --> 00:37:27,761
Now, this contains all the original
designs and patterns.

470
00:37:27,841 --> 00:37:30,081
When you are done with designing,
give them..

471
00:37:30,161 --> 00:37:31,601
Now, be very careful, Gaurav.

472
00:37:31,681 --> 00:37:33,001
This is highly sensitive data..

473
00:37:33,081 --> 00:37:34,641
Okay.
- ...and extremely important to us.

474
00:37:34,721 --> 00:37:36,401
You need to keep it safe
with you all the time. - Okay.

475
00:37:36,481 --> 00:37:38,241
I mean that seriously.

476
00:37:38,321 --> 00:37:40,521
The target is arriving from Miami
carrying highly sensitive data.

477
00:37:40,841 --> 00:37:42,241
And Karan wants that data.

478
00:37:42,321 --> 00:37:44,081
Did you find out who the target is?
- No.

479
00:37:44,481 --> 00:37:45,721
But I know his contact.

480
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:47,841
Defence Security Mishra.

481
00:37:49,841 --> 00:37:51,641
A deal has been finalised
between Mishra and the target.

482
00:37:51,761 --> 00:37:53,161
And they are going to meet soon.

483
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:56,161
Robbie and Shree,
keep an eye on Mishra.

484
00:37:59,201 --> 00:38:02,081
Track all his movements.
Do not take your eyes off him.
Track all his movements.
Do not take your eyes off him.

485
00:38:02,721 --> 00:38:04,361
We have to hack his phone
before the deal is struck.

486
00:38:06,481 --> 00:38:08,121
We have to only wait
for the right time now.

487
00:38:20,441 --> 00:38:22,521
Secretary is in the
mood to go to a club. He's alone.

488
00:38:22,881 --> 00:38:23,921
This is the perfect time,
I am going inside.

489
00:38:24,001 --> 00:38:26,521
Copy. Yakub, I need a
honey trap for Mishra.

490
00:38:26,761 --> 00:38:27,841
Nikki is on standby.

491
00:38:28,241 --> 00:38:30,801
Okay. - Shree, send him
the location. - Copy. - Good.

492
00:38:32,841 --> 00:38:34,361
Thank you.
- All right, sir.

493
00:38:35,201 --> 00:38:37,041
Here's your drink.
- Excuse me.

494
00:38:37,721 --> 00:38:39,161
Give me something to stir this.
- Sure, sir.

495
00:38:39,241 --> 00:38:42,441
Mishra will stay here for a while.
He just ordered drinks.

496
00:38:42,521 --> 00:38:44,361
Can you stir it for me?
- Yes, sure. - Robbie.

497
00:38:44,521 --> 00:38:46,641
Is Mishra using the same phone now?
- Positive.

498
00:38:47,041 --> 00:38:50,401
Great! Shree, did you
activate Nikki? - Done.

499
00:38:50,601 --> 00:38:52,041
I don't think Nikki will work here.

500
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:54,361
Why won't she?
Nikki is the best.

501
00:38:54,921 --> 00:38:56,801
You are lean.
- Yes, sir.

502
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:57,881
Why don't you drink something?

503
00:38:58,281 --> 00:39:00,041
A fast bowler can't bowl
on a cunning pitch, pal.
A fast bowler can't bowl
on a cunning pitch, pal.

504
00:39:00,361 --> 00:39:03,841
Protein shake? - Yes..
- Shake it and gulp it.

505
00:39:04,241 --> 00:39:06,881
What?
- Someone else has to pitch in.

506
00:39:06,961 --> 00:39:09,561
Oh, shit!

507
00:39:33,561 --> 00:39:35,561
Hi!
- Hi.

508
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:44,761
What are you drinking?

509
00:39:46,081 --> 00:39:47,281
Mojito.

510
00:39:54,241 --> 00:39:56,441
It's too sweet.
- I like it sweet.

511
00:39:58,161 --> 00:40:00,441
What drink do you like?
- Dirty martini.
What drink do you like?
- Dirty martini.

512
00:40:01,001 --> 00:40:02,281
Strong boy!

513
00:40:03,361 --> 00:40:05,281
Strong drink, is it?
- Oh, yes.

514
00:40:06,921 --> 00:40:09,481
Hey, one Dirty Martini
for the strong boy.

515
00:40:11,241 --> 00:40:13,041
And somebody pour more for me!

516
00:40:13,721 --> 00:40:14,841
I mean, I want a repeat.

517
00:40:23,721 --> 00:40:25,041
Hey, nice kurta.

518
00:40:26,681 --> 00:40:28,721
Very..

519
00:40:29,641 --> 00:40:30,721
Manly.

520
00:40:30,801 --> 00:40:32,081
Is it Khadi?

521
00:40:33,481 --> 00:40:34,961
It's not Khadi.

522
00:40:36,481 --> 00:40:38,081
It's pure, boy.

523
00:40:45,241 --> 00:40:46,321
Very tight.

524
00:40:47,121 --> 00:40:48,281
Why is the laptop so slow?

525
00:40:50,481 --> 00:40:51,521
Are you even doing something?

526
00:40:55,681 --> 00:40:56,921
Bad manners.

527
00:40:57,161 --> 00:40:58,161
It's a bad habit
to check your phone

528
00:40:58,241 --> 00:41:00,001
when you're sitting with someone.

529
00:41:00,321 --> 00:41:01,561
Is it?
- Yes.

530
00:41:01,761 --> 00:41:04,361
Since you asked,
I'll switch it off.

531
00:41:07,201 --> 00:41:08,601
You are so cute.

532
00:41:18,481 --> 00:41:20,281
You are no less.

533
00:41:24,881 --> 00:41:26,401
What are you..

534
00:41:26,801 --> 00:41:27,921
Rishi's honour is at stake.
Only you can help.

535
00:41:27,961 --> 00:41:29,881
You don't understand,
he will be violated.

536
00:41:40,921 --> 00:41:42,001
What is Nikki doing here?

537
00:41:42,601 --> 00:41:44,321
Nikki..

538
00:41:45,041 --> 00:41:47,521
The data pack expired.
She didn't receive the message.

539
00:41:47,601 --> 00:41:48,681
Robbie, go and stop her.

540
00:41:50,361 --> 00:41:52,161
Robbie!
Gun!

541
00:41:58,801 --> 00:42:00,161
Hi.
Hi.

542
00:42:00,881 --> 00:42:02,241
Hi.

543
00:42:06,241 --> 00:42:07,441
Hi.

544
00:42:10,641 --> 00:42:12,441
Can I buy you a drink?
- No.

545
00:42:12,961 --> 00:42:14,121
Hi.
- Come on.

546
00:42:14,361 --> 00:42:15,761
No!
- Just one drink..

547
00:42:16,201 --> 00:42:17,521
One..

548
00:42:19,801 --> 00:42:21,081
Nikki, abort.

549
00:42:21,841 --> 00:42:22,721
Yes.

550
00:42:23,961 --> 00:42:25,601
Oh, my God! - Relax!
- Idiot!

551
00:42:32,521 --> 00:42:33,801
So are you..

552
00:42:34,761 --> 00:42:36,561
Are you one or not?
Just tell me!

553
00:42:37,041 --> 00:42:41,201
I swing both ways.

554
00:42:41,481 --> 00:42:42,601
Idiot!

555
00:42:43,521 --> 00:42:45,081
Darling, one second.

556
00:42:47,001 --> 00:42:47,881
That phone is mine.

557
00:42:50,081 --> 00:42:51,081
And that one's yours.

558
00:42:54,241 --> 00:42:56,401
Well, at least our phones match.

559
00:42:57,721 --> 00:43:00,481
Not done, man.
- What?
Not done, man.
- What?

560
00:43:04,121 --> 00:43:06,241
So, when will you
return from Mumbai?

561
00:43:06,321 --> 00:43:07,121
Just 2 months.

562
00:43:08,761 --> 00:43:09,601
Drive a little slow.

563
00:43:09,961 --> 00:43:11,961
What's the hurry to drop me off?

564
00:43:13,081 --> 00:43:15,641
This is how I roll, baby.
- Right.

565
00:43:16,881 --> 00:43:19,281
But at the intersection
in the front.. - Yes..

566
00:43:22,081 --> 00:43:24,161
...there will be policemen.
- Shit!

567
00:43:25,961 --> 00:43:26,841
Have a nice day.

568
00:43:27,481 --> 00:43:28,921
You have a nice day.

569
00:43:40,321 --> 00:43:41,681
Shut up!

570
00:43:42,481 --> 00:43:43,881
I think you like policemen.

571
00:43:44,361 --> 00:43:45,801
That's why you always
break the rules.

572
00:43:45,881 --> 00:43:48,921
What crap! - Oh, so do you do
all this to annoy me?

573
00:43:49,281 --> 00:43:51,521
No..
That department is yours alone.

574
00:43:51,961 --> 00:43:54,001
You were behaving so weirdly
in the restaurant the other day.

575
00:43:55,881 --> 00:43:58,521
Do you..
- No.

576
00:43:59,961 --> 00:44:03,001
Are you sure?
- Didn't I say I don't? - Good!

577
00:44:03,241 --> 00:44:04,361
Thank God!

578
00:44:05,721 --> 00:44:08,681
Why are you happy about that?

579
00:44:11,441 --> 00:44:13,881
No, it's not that I'm happy..

580
00:44:16,601 --> 00:44:20,601
I'm just sort of happy that..

581
00:44:21,041 --> 00:44:22,321
Yes.

582
00:44:24,961 --> 00:44:26,241
Yes..

583
00:44:27,641 --> 00:44:30,481
Anyway, listen Kavya.
- Yes.

584
00:44:30,801 --> 00:44:32,881
I know you from 31 months.
- How many?

585
00:44:33,161 --> 00:44:34,041
31 months.

586
00:44:34,361 --> 00:44:35,481
Oh.

587
00:44:35,921 --> 00:44:38,241
And I wish to tell you something
about myself.

588
00:44:39,401 --> 00:44:40,721
Okay.

589
00:44:45,681 --> 00:44:47,001
Let it go.

590
00:44:47,881 --> 00:44:49,841
We'll talk once I get back.

591
00:45:03,921 --> 00:45:06,001
Guys,
the target has landed in Mumbai.

592
00:45:11,241 --> 00:45:12,761
The meeting is fixed.

593
00:45:12,841 --> 00:45:14,201
It's their first meeting, right?

594
00:45:14,561 --> 00:45:15,521
Yes.

595
00:45:15,721 --> 00:45:17,481
What's the target's name?
- Gaurav.

596
00:45:18,001 --> 00:45:19,081
Gaurav Kapoor.

597
00:45:50,761 --> 00:45:54,721
Get in!
- No.. - Move..

598
00:46:06,881 --> 00:46:10,481
You don't know what I can do..
- Quiet! - Shut up!

599
00:46:19,841 --> 00:46:21,801
Did Gaurav reach?
- Not yet.

600
00:46:24,121 --> 00:46:26,441
Don't touch my phone..

601
00:46:26,521 --> 00:46:27,481
Give it back to me.

602
00:46:27,521 --> 00:46:29,361
Boys!
- Gaurav has reached.

603
00:46:29,961 --> 00:46:32,681
Rishi, Gaurav
is moving towards you.

604
00:46:55,401 --> 00:46:56,881
Are you Gaurav Kapoor?

605
00:46:57,161 --> 00:46:59,281
Yes.
- Hi. - Hi.

606
00:46:59,801 --> 00:47:00,601
I'm Mishra.
I'm Mishra.

607
00:47:00,681 --> 00:47:05,321
You're Mishra! I was expecting
to see a middle-aged man.

608
00:47:06,481 --> 00:47:08,001
The defence secretary and all.

609
00:47:08,161 --> 00:47:09,321
Young India!

610
00:47:10,801 --> 00:47:12,041
Did you receive the payment?
- Yes.

611
00:47:12,281 --> 00:47:14,201
Then give it to me.

612
00:47:15,201 --> 00:47:16,521
It's in the vehicle.
- Let's go.

613
00:47:26,441 --> 00:47:27,321
Welcome to Mumbai.
- Hi. Gaurav.

614
00:47:27,401 --> 00:47:28,641
Nice to meet you, Gaurav.
- Nice to meet you.

615
00:47:28,721 --> 00:47:29,961
Meet my CTO.
- Nice to meet you.

616
00:47:30,001 --> 00:47:31,921
Much faster,
efficient and easy to use.

617
00:47:32,201 --> 00:47:33,761
We've also done some tests
to prove it.

618
00:47:33,921 --> 00:47:36,081
Patterns and designs.
- Great! Thanks.

619
00:47:37,841 --> 00:47:40,001
I think that should
complete the deal. - Yes.

620
00:47:41,201 --> 00:47:43,201
It was great doing business
with you. - Great. Thank you, sir.

621
00:48:06,801 --> 00:48:07,681
What did you do!

622
00:48:08,001 --> 00:48:10,081
We received the package.
What was the need to kill him?

623
00:48:10,601 --> 00:48:11,881
Because this was the operation.

624
00:48:12,281 --> 00:48:13,201
Listen to me!

625
00:48:13,521 --> 00:48:15,201
I give the orders.
Who are you to decide?

626
00:48:15,241 --> 00:48:17,321
Your operation is over.
Mine begins, now.

627
00:48:17,761 --> 00:48:19,721
Have you forgotten
that you have retired?

628
00:48:24,281 --> 00:48:25,601
Why didn't Colonel tell me?

629
00:48:25,681 --> 00:48:29,161
Because the Colonel knows that
you don't have the courage to kill.

630
00:48:30,321 --> 00:48:31,121
Scoot!

631
00:48:31,201 --> 00:48:32,441
Go back to your mansion.

632
00:48:32,961 --> 00:48:35,481
Listen to your wife blabber
and change your kids' diapers.

633
00:48:35,641 --> 00:48:36,801
You're fit to do just that.

634
00:48:38,921 --> 00:48:40,361
Dispose the car and the body.

635
00:48:40,721 --> 00:48:42,041
Don't leave any evidence.

636
00:48:42,841 --> 00:48:44,561
Get going!
- Yes, Mr. Yakub.

637
00:50:19,401 --> 00:50:22,001
Look, what happened!
- The car's stuck!

638
00:53:27,881 --> 00:53:29,801
Airport, please.
Thank you.

639
00:53:49,401 --> 00:53:50,841
Excuse me.
- Yes, sure.

640
00:53:51,841 --> 00:53:54,161
Rishi, are you okay?
Did you get the drive?

641
00:53:54,721 --> 00:53:55,881
The drive's destroyed.

642
00:53:56,401 --> 00:53:57,441
Shit.

643
00:53:57,721 --> 00:53:59,721
We can't get Colonel
without the drive.

644
00:54:01,081 --> 00:54:02,681
Leave India as soon as possible

645
00:54:02,761 --> 00:54:05,361
because Colonel's whole Unit X
will be after you.

646
00:54:06,001 --> 00:54:08,721
I'm sorry, Rishi.
You're on your own.

647
00:54:10,081 --> 00:54:10,921
Damn it.

648
00:54:21,561 --> 00:54:22,721
Where are you?

649
00:54:23,481 --> 00:54:24,681
We are done, Colonel.

650
00:54:25,801 --> 00:54:28,761
Rishi, I need that data.
Come back right now.

651
00:54:29,241 --> 00:54:30,361
I can't, Colonel.

652
00:54:30,681 --> 00:54:33,681
I've done a lot for you. Now,
I want to do something for myself.

653
00:54:33,761 --> 00:54:37,001
I will hunt you down, Rishi.
I will kill you!

654
00:54:37,681 --> 00:54:39,081
Just imagine,
what will happen

655
00:54:40,121 --> 00:54:42,761
if the information of this drive
is leaked?

656
00:54:44,041 --> 00:54:46,561
Yes, Colonel.
I know about it.

657
00:54:47,081 --> 00:54:48,641
And right now,
the drive is with me.

658
00:54:48,961 --> 00:54:51,561
Listen, you won't do anything.

659
00:54:52,121 --> 00:54:54,441
Goodbye, Colonel.
- Damn it!

660
00:54:56,041 --> 00:54:58,201
Boys, he will try
to leave the country.

661
00:54:58,281 --> 00:55:00,681
Check all the exit points
and his identities too.
Check all the exit points
and his identities too.

662
00:55:01,001 --> 00:55:03,601
That drive is an insurance
policy for him.

663
00:55:03,681 --> 00:55:05,561
But for us,
it is a ticking time bomb!

664
00:55:05,961 --> 00:55:08,441
I need that drive, anyhow!
Do you guys understand?

665
00:55:08,841 --> 00:55:11,561
And Rishi must die this time!

666
00:55:14,921 --> 00:55:17,521
Sir, is this your first time
in Mumbai?

667
00:55:18,121 --> 00:55:20,641
No. It was my hometown
five years ago.

668
00:55:23,201 --> 00:55:26,081
Nothing has changed,
except for me.

669
00:55:27,921 --> 00:55:29,321
I was a different person
back then.

670
00:55:30,481 --> 00:55:32,081
Sometimes, you need
to change yourself

671
00:55:32,561 --> 00:55:33,881
in order to change your fate.

672
00:57:10,281 --> 00:57:11,561
Hi.
I'm Gaurav.

673
00:57:15,601 --> 00:57:17,801
Hi.
I'm Gaurav from Miami.

674
00:57:19,321 --> 00:57:20,561
Passport, please.

675
00:57:21,401 --> 00:57:22,841
Place your palm
on the scanner.

676
00:57:30,561 --> 00:57:32,521
Welcome back to Miami, sir.
Have a nice day.

677
00:57:45,601 --> 00:57:47,241
Not everybody
gets a second chance.

678
00:57:47,681 --> 00:57:48,801
But I did.

679
00:57:49,041 --> 00:57:50,841
And today
I am leading the kind of life

680
00:57:51,201 --> 00:57:52,401
I really wanted to.

681
00:57:52,721 --> 00:57:54,081
When something is destined
to happen

682
00:57:54,161 --> 00:57:55,681
it happens at that time, sir.

683
00:57:57,121 --> 00:58:00,201
Well said.
Is this your own proverb?
Well said.
Is this your own proverb?

684
00:58:01,121 --> 00:58:02,281
This is not my..
- Be careful!

685
00:58:28,241 --> 00:58:31,241
Colonel.
- Hey, Yakub, come!

686
00:58:31,321 --> 00:58:32,481
I want to show you something.

687
00:58:34,801 --> 00:58:36,841
Someone sent me this video
on WhatsApp this morning.

688
00:58:37,121 --> 00:58:38,601
It has been viral for a week.

689
00:58:50,561 --> 00:58:53,241
Rishi?
- Rishi.

690
00:58:54,081 --> 00:58:55,041
He was in Mumbai.

691
00:58:55,161 --> 00:58:56,801
When I asked the driver,
he told me

692
00:58:56,881 --> 00:58:58,321
that he was going
to the international airport

693
00:58:58,401 --> 00:59:00,361
and was going to board
flight number UA-49.
and was going to board
flight number UA-49.

694
00:59:00,441 --> 00:59:02,401
Where is he now?
- Miami.

695
00:59:03,801 --> 00:59:05,521
Out.
Sit.

696
00:59:06,881 --> 00:59:10,881
Yakub, you are my first recruit.
I never felt the need

697
00:59:10,961 --> 00:59:12,801
to hide anything from you.

698
00:59:13,081 --> 00:59:14,521
Do whatever you want, Yakub.

699
00:59:14,961 --> 00:59:17,441
I need that drive at any cost.

700
00:59:17,521 --> 00:59:20,481
or he will destroy
this organisation!

701
00:59:21,041 --> 00:59:22,321
I won't lie to you.

702
00:59:22,401 --> 00:59:24,441
I won't ask you to do it
for your nation.

703
00:59:25,561 --> 00:59:26,801
Please do it for me.

704
00:59:27,881 --> 00:59:31,641
Whatever I have done till today,
has always been for you.

705
00:59:33,561 --> 00:59:34,761
Consider it done!

706
00:59:35,561 --> 00:59:38,321
I want Rishi.
Activate the network.

707
00:59:39,041 --> 00:59:40,281
Do we have any contacts
in Miami?

708
00:59:40,841 --> 00:59:42,001
Jignesh.

709
00:59:46,081 --> 00:59:48,041
'Hi, the temperature today is 68.'

710
01:00:02,361 --> 01:00:03,281
Sorry..

711
01:00:03,481 --> 01:00:05,961
This is exciting!

712
01:00:06,081 --> 01:00:07,401
Tell me how did it happen?

713
01:00:07,481 --> 01:00:09,201
In general, when someone gets hurt

714
01:00:09,281 --> 01:00:10,521
people become sympathetic
towards them.

715
01:00:10,601 --> 01:00:12,601
I did get you sympathy, my dear.

716
01:00:12,841 --> 01:00:15,201
So tell me..
How did the fight begin?

717
01:00:15,281 --> 01:00:16,361
It wasn't a fight.

718
01:00:16,881 --> 01:00:19,881
My car got hit. And there wasn't
any driver in the other car.

719
01:00:19,961 --> 01:00:22,561
I see.
- Yes. Nothing exciting. Sorry.

720
01:00:22,761 --> 01:00:24,881
Anyway, take your sympathy.
Come.

721
01:00:25,921 --> 01:00:27,201
Sorry..

722
01:00:28,721 --> 01:00:32,041
Gaurav, how long
do we know each other?

723
01:00:32,121 --> 01:00:33,481
It's been 31 months.

724
01:00:33,561 --> 01:00:34,761
Exactly!

725
01:00:34,841 --> 01:00:39,961
And you have done a lot for me
during these 31 months.

726
01:00:40,561 --> 01:00:43,361
I mean, even I've done that.
- No.

727
01:00:44,161 --> 01:00:46,081
Didn't I?
- No..

728
01:00:49,801 --> 01:00:51,361
Forget it.

729
01:00:51,681 --> 01:00:52,961
This is the new me.

730
01:00:53,041 --> 01:00:55,881
Sensitive, caring and thankful.

731
01:00:56,001 --> 01:00:58,641
So, I've brought some gifts
for you.

732
01:00:58,761 --> 01:01:00,761
Here it is.
This is for your hand.
Here it is.
This is for your hand.

733
01:01:01,761 --> 01:01:03,361
Very satisfying.

734
01:01:05,361 --> 01:01:06,321
Thanks.

735
01:01:07,761 --> 01:01:09,001
And..

736
01:01:10,801 --> 01:01:12,081
This is for your good luck.

737
01:01:14,161 --> 01:01:15,441
What's this?

738
01:01:17,961 --> 01:01:21,801
This is like a Feng Shui.

739
01:01:22,521 --> 01:01:24,641
I'm sure you believe
in all these stuffs, right?

740
01:01:25,601 --> 01:01:27,801
Not really..
- I see.

741
01:01:28,961 --> 01:01:31,681
Do you have some work with me?
- What do you mean by that?

742
01:01:31,921 --> 01:01:33,041
I don't have any work.

743
01:01:33,241 --> 01:01:34,401
I just came..
- Are you sure?

744
01:01:36,361 --> 01:01:39,601
If you insist
I have something for you.

745
01:01:40,401 --> 01:01:42,121
My parents are coming from India.

746
01:01:42,281 --> 01:01:43,761
Can you help me pick them up?

747
01:01:44,441 --> 01:01:47,241
They carry a lot of luggage.
It'll fit in your tempo..

748
01:01:47,321 --> 01:01:48,761
Tempo?

749
01:01:48,921 --> 01:01:50,481
That's why I'm asking.

750
01:01:51,961 --> 01:01:53,521
Yes, of course.

751
01:01:53,961 --> 01:01:55,561
Thank you, Gaurav.

752
01:01:55,641 --> 01:01:58,641
Listen, we can free it up now,
okay? We'll hang out.

753
01:02:18,841 --> 01:02:20,601
Come on.
- Yes, give me two minutes.

754
01:02:26,441 --> 01:02:29,601
"These are the beautiful days."

755
01:02:29,961 --> 01:02:32,921
"These are the beautiful evenings."

756
01:02:33,161 --> 01:02:39,721
"My life gets brighter
when you are with me."

757
01:02:40,321 --> 01:02:43,401
"These are the beautiful days."

758
01:02:43,761 --> 01:02:46,801
"These are the beautiful evenings."

759
01:02:47,041 --> 01:02:53,121
"My life gets brighter
when you are with me."

760
01:02:53,361 --> 01:03:00,081
"Let's get pixilated
as the night comes along."
"Let's get pixilated
as the night comes along."

761
01:03:00,241 --> 01:03:06,161
"If we get locked in a room
and the key gets lost"

762
01:03:06,241 --> 01:03:08,801
"it'll be great.."

763
01:03:13,001 --> 01:03:16,121
"It'll be great.."

764
01:03:20,001 --> 01:03:23,081
"It'll be great.."

765
01:03:26,841 --> 01:03:30,041
"It'll be great.."

766
01:03:34,881 --> 01:03:38,201
"The day has passed.
It's about to be night."

767
01:03:38,361 --> 01:03:41,721
"Let me go.."

768
01:03:41,801 --> 01:03:45,241
"You are talking insensibly."

769
01:03:45,321 --> 01:03:48,521
"It can make my demented heart
fall for you."

770
01:03:48,681 --> 01:03:52,201
"The day has passed.
It's about to be night."

771
01:03:52,281 --> 01:03:55,481
"Let me go.."

772
01:03:55,561 --> 01:03:59,241
"I don't want you on my way."

773
01:03:59,321 --> 01:04:02,481
"Because I have to go
a long way.. "
"Because I have to go
a long way.. "

774
01:04:02,681 --> 01:04:06,161
"Wherever you go"

775
01:04:06,241 --> 01:04:09,481
"you'll find me in the way."

776
01:04:09,561 --> 01:04:15,321
"If you stay back
for the night with me"

777
01:04:15,481 --> 01:04:18,121
"it'll be great.."

778
01:04:22,481 --> 01:04:24,961
"It'll be great.."

779
01:04:37,481 --> 01:04:39,361
Hi, dear!
- Dad!

780
01:04:39,441 --> 01:04:40,841
Look at this luggage!

781
01:04:40,921 --> 01:04:42,441
Did they throw you out of India?

782
01:04:42,521 --> 01:04:43,841
They just seem to be rich!
- Love you.

783
01:04:43,921 --> 01:04:45,161
They took five dollars
for a trolley.

784
01:04:45,241 --> 01:04:46,881
That is INR 327.
What nonsense!

785
01:04:46,961 --> 01:04:48,281
Welcome to Miami, Dad!

786
01:04:48,401 --> 01:04:49,841
We get free trolleys in India.

787
01:04:49,961 --> 01:04:51,241
Also a man
to help you for free.

788
01:04:51,321 --> 01:04:53,681
You started calculating,
the moment you stepped here!

789
01:04:53,801 --> 01:04:55,001
Why don't you just chill?

790
01:04:55,081 --> 01:04:57,121
Yes. Chill.
- Chill.

791
01:04:58,321 --> 01:05:00,761
This is..
- Greetings, sir. - Gaurav.
This is..
- Greetings, sir. - Gaurav.

792
01:05:00,841 --> 01:05:03,961
My good friend. - Hello.
- Greetings, ma'am. - It's okay.

793
01:05:04,881 --> 01:05:05,801
How was your flight?

794
01:05:05,881 --> 01:05:07,001
It was good..

795
01:05:08,721 --> 01:05:11,401
How was the food?
- Good. All good.

796
01:05:11,481 --> 01:05:13,161
Very nice.

797
01:05:13,281 --> 01:05:15,521
Let me take the bags.
- I'll.. - No.. I'll do it.

798
01:05:15,601 --> 01:05:17,161
Okay..

799
01:05:21,121 --> 01:05:23,401
You shouldn't touch the knees.
You should touch the feet.

800
01:05:23,521 --> 01:05:24,801
He's taking the bags.
Let me..

801
01:05:24,881 --> 01:05:25,761
What's this?

802
01:05:25,841 --> 01:05:28,121
You should have worn some proper
clothes. Your lingerie is visible.

803
01:05:28,201 --> 01:05:29,321
Mom, it's Miami.

804
01:05:33,401 --> 01:05:35,641
You drive really good.

805
01:05:36,521 --> 01:05:38,441
It's so smooth.

806
01:05:38,601 --> 01:05:40,841
Dear, are you a 'Khatri'
or a 'Sindhi'?

807
01:05:40,921 --> 01:05:42,121
Mom, please..

808
01:05:43,401 --> 01:05:45,601
How do you manage
with your food?

809
01:05:45,681 --> 01:05:46,841
Do you have a maid?

810
01:05:46,921 --> 01:05:48,841
No, ma'am.
I cook on my own.

811
01:05:48,921 --> 01:05:50,481
I am very fond of cooking.

812
01:05:50,561 --> 01:05:52,681
Kitchen is the favourite place
of my house.

813
01:05:52,761 --> 01:05:54,161
Do you own a house?

814
01:05:54,241 --> 01:05:56,281
Yes. I got the perfect position
few days back.

815
01:05:56,361 --> 01:05:59,001
That's great. You own a house
at such a young age.

816
01:05:59,361 --> 01:06:00,241
That's good.
That's good.

817
01:06:00,401 --> 01:06:02,801
We are tired of paying rents.

818
01:06:05,961 --> 01:06:09,161
Boys like you
are called quality boys.

819
01:06:09,641 --> 01:06:11,761
You should get married.

820
01:06:11,841 --> 01:06:13,361
I am planning on it, ma'am.

821
01:06:13,441 --> 01:06:14,681
Did you find a girl?

822
01:06:18,041 --> 01:06:20,361
You can come
to my house for tea.

823
01:06:20,721 --> 01:06:22,241
I'll be happy.

824
01:06:22,481 --> 01:06:25,161
I wanted to say something.
- It won't be possible, Gaurav..

825
01:06:25,321 --> 01:06:27,841
They've a busy schedule..
- We would come.. No problem.

826
01:06:27,961 --> 01:06:29,241
We will definitely come..

827
01:06:29,321 --> 01:06:31,641
We'll come..
- Yes.. Of course.

828
01:06:32,641 --> 01:06:33,761
Do you want to have some
'Puran Poli'?

829
01:06:33,841 --> 01:06:35,241
It's homemade.
I made it.

830
01:06:39,161 --> 01:06:41,441
I had given it to them.

831
01:06:41,721 --> 01:06:42,641
Leave me..

832
01:06:42,721 --> 01:06:45,481
Please..

833
01:06:45,561 --> 01:06:47,361
Shut up, you idiot!

834
01:06:48,721 --> 01:06:50,201
Don't you know?

835
01:06:50,561 --> 01:06:53,081
For how long Mr. Jignesh
has been operating in the USA?

836
01:06:53,841 --> 01:06:54,841
What do you think?

837
01:06:54,921 --> 01:06:56,721
You'll leak my information
to the Punjab gang

838
01:06:56,801 --> 01:06:58,041
and I'll stand still?

839
01:06:58,361 --> 01:06:59,241
Do you think that

840
01:06:59,601 --> 01:07:02,361
Mr. Jignesh left Bapora
and came here only for you?
Mr. Jignesh left Bapora
and came here only for you?

841
01:07:04,321 --> 01:07:08,481
Wash him off with detergent
until he speaks out.

842
01:07:08,681 --> 01:07:09,601
Please..
- Okay, sir.

843
01:07:09,721 --> 01:07:11,601
Start the engine.
- I'm telling you the truth.

844
01:07:11,801 --> 01:07:13,361
I told you everything.

845
01:07:13,561 --> 01:07:16,241
This is all I know.
Don't do this. Please.

846
01:07:22,161 --> 01:07:23,641
Great!

847
01:07:28,001 --> 01:07:30,321
Jignesh Patel speaking.
What can I do for you?

848
01:07:31,561 --> 01:07:32,521
Mr. Yakub.

849
01:07:32,761 --> 01:07:34,761
It's been a long time..

850
01:07:38,121 --> 01:07:39,321
Yes..

851
01:07:41,161 --> 01:07:43,361
I..
One..

852
01:07:46,761 --> 01:07:48,241
Don't worry, Mr. Yakub.

853
01:07:48,321 --> 01:07:50,121
Send me the photo through
WhatsApp. I'll take care of him.

854
01:07:51,721 --> 01:07:55,881
Just tell me the date.
I'll pick you up.

855
01:07:56,281 --> 01:07:57,361
Hello.

856
01:07:59,801 --> 01:08:02,121
Put him in the dryer.
Harish.
Put him in the dryer.
Harish.

857
01:08:02,561 --> 01:08:03,601
Make it quick.

858
01:08:03,841 --> 01:08:04,881
Yes, sir.

859
01:08:05,321 --> 01:08:06,801
Forward the picture on the WhatsApp

860
01:08:06,881 --> 01:08:08,401
to the group
'Desi Store Mafia Group'.

861
01:08:12,121 --> 01:08:13,801
His name is Rishi.

862
01:08:14,041 --> 01:08:16,441
Mr. Yakub needs him urgently.

863
01:08:16,761 --> 01:08:20,761
No matter where he is hiding

864
01:08:20,841 --> 01:08:23,921
bring him to me alive.

865
01:08:24,481 --> 01:08:25,681
I want him alive.

866
01:08:26,001 --> 01:08:27,401
Alive.

867
01:08:43,161 --> 01:08:44,321
Yes, Koko.

868
01:08:44,401 --> 01:08:45,481
I found your man.

869
01:08:45,561 --> 01:08:46,481
Did you find him?

870
01:08:47,281 --> 01:08:48,921
Great job, Koko.

871
01:08:49,001 --> 01:08:50,241
Now just follow him.

872
01:08:50,561 --> 01:08:52,241
'I'm sending you the location.'

873
01:08:52,841 --> 01:08:55,641
Koko, follow him. Catch him.
Grab him.

874
01:08:57,201 --> 01:08:58,561
Hello.

875
01:09:00,681 --> 01:09:01,721
Shit.

876
01:09:04,281 --> 01:09:07,201
This phone troubles me a lot!

877
01:09:08,841 --> 01:09:10,721
It's always dead on time.

878
01:09:12,521 --> 01:09:13,681
'Hi, this is Jignesh.'

879
01:09:13,761 --> 01:09:16,161
'Go ahead and leave message
and have yourself a nice day.'

880
01:09:16,281 --> 01:09:17,481
'How are you? Are you good?'

881
01:09:17,561 --> 01:09:20,401
'Jignesh is busy.
Leave a message.'

882
01:09:20,601 --> 01:09:21,721
Shit.

883
01:09:23,801 --> 01:09:25,161
Shit.

884
01:09:37,801 --> 01:09:39,801
Buddy, we'll see..

885
01:09:40,201 --> 01:09:41,561
Yes?
- Are you Rishi?

886
01:09:44,641 --> 01:09:46,001
Wrong house.

887
01:09:46,921 --> 01:09:48,521
Rishi.

888
01:09:49,481 --> 01:09:50,721
Right house.

889
01:09:51,761 --> 01:09:53,921
'How are you? Are you good?
Jignesh is busy..'

890
01:09:58,801 --> 01:10:01,681
I'm telling you, man. It's a..
- Shut up..
I'm telling you, man. It's a..
- Shut up..

891
01:10:03,521 --> 01:10:04,841
Man!

892
01:10:06,401 --> 01:10:07,721
Jignesh will call me back.

893
01:10:07,761 --> 01:10:09,121
Then, we will see
what you got to say.

894
01:10:14,201 --> 01:10:15,241
It's a nice house.

895
01:10:16,961 --> 01:10:19,241
Thanks! - Are you rich?
Do you have a lot of money?

896
01:10:20,121 --> 01:10:22,521
Home loan. And big EMIs.

897
01:10:33,161 --> 01:10:35,241
It's 'Puran Poli'.
Indian homemade sweet.

898
01:10:36,401 --> 01:10:37,321
Do you want some?

899
01:10:49,721 --> 01:10:51,321
This is delicious!

900
01:11:05,121 --> 01:11:06,201
Hello. Where are you?

901
01:11:07,561 --> 01:11:08,641
All have reached here.

902
01:11:08,721 --> 01:11:10,721
They are about to begin the
presentation. - I'll be there.

903
01:11:11,601 --> 01:11:13,641
The clients are enquiring about
you. Tell me, where are you?

904
01:11:13,721 --> 01:11:15,801
I am on the exit gate
of the office building.

905
01:11:35,441 --> 01:11:37,481
I am sorry. Sorry, Dikshit.
- Where were you?

906
01:11:37,561 --> 01:11:40,401
I am sorry.. - This is Gaurav
from our sales team.

907
01:11:40,601 --> 01:11:42,921
He will be reading
the presentation now.

908
01:11:45,921 --> 01:11:46,961
Good afternoon, everyone.

909
01:11:47,001 --> 01:11:49,321
Apologies for the delay. Was just
working on last minute numbers.

910
01:12:01,321 --> 01:12:03,561
As you can see, post the
implementation of the new module

911
01:12:03,761 --> 01:12:05,241
the ERP system has sustained.

912
01:12:05,441 --> 01:12:06,961
And it directly effects
the productivity of..

913
01:12:08,761 --> 01:12:09,761
Shit!

914
01:12:12,161 --> 01:12:13,281
I mean, Dikshit.

915
01:12:14,081 --> 01:12:15,601
My colleague, Dikshit,
will take over.

916
01:12:16,441 --> 01:12:18,241
Dikshit, why don't you throw
some light on this? - No.

917
01:12:22,201 --> 01:12:23,321
Where is the fire?

918
01:12:45,321 --> 01:12:49,041
You see, the curve goes up.
And then, it comes down.

919
01:12:51,921 --> 01:12:53,361
I think the projector is tilted.

920
01:12:59,361 --> 01:13:00,321
Shit!
Shit!

921
01:13:01,601 --> 01:13:03,521
What is he doing?

922
01:13:29,361 --> 01:13:31,281
Sorry.
- What's happening, dude?

923
01:13:33,081 --> 01:13:35,961
Sorry. I will take over
from Dikshit, guys.

924
01:13:39,081 --> 01:13:40,481
Is the projector tilted?

925
01:14:22,921 --> 01:14:24,481
"Who is your daddy now?"

926
01:14:28,721 --> 01:14:31,401
"Who..
Who is your daddy now?"

927
01:14:37,921 --> 01:14:39,081
Dude, who is he?

928
01:14:39,241 --> 01:14:40,401
He came out from your car boot.

929
01:14:40,481 --> 01:14:42,321
Listen. It's me whom you want.
And not him. - Shut up!

930
01:14:43,041 --> 01:14:44,401
Shut up!

931
01:14:44,601 --> 01:14:46,241
Hey..
- Dikshit, calm down.

932
01:14:46,281 --> 01:14:48,121
My phone. Give me the phone.

933
01:14:48,481 --> 01:14:50,561
Just give me the phone.

934
01:14:58,401 --> 01:14:59,961
Dikshit, move towards the right.
I will move towards the left.

935
01:15:00,041 --> 01:15:00,841
To your right or mine?

936
01:15:00,921 --> 01:15:02,961
What is it?
Shut up! Okay?

937
01:15:03,241 --> 01:15:04,361
Don't talk Indian language.

938
01:15:09,361 --> 01:15:11,241
'The number you are..'

939
01:15:18,881 --> 01:15:19,961
'Hi, this is Jignesh.'

940
01:15:20,041 --> 01:15:22,361
'Go ahead and leave message
and have yourself a nice day.'

941
01:15:22,481 --> 01:15:23,441
'How are you? Are you good?'

942
01:15:43,361 --> 01:15:44,641
Dikshit, are you okay?
- He is dead!

943
01:15:45,201 --> 01:15:46,761
I killed him..
- Just calm down.

944
01:15:46,801 --> 01:15:47,761
It was an accident.
Relax!

945
01:15:47,841 --> 01:15:49,321
As you know,
I never even slapped anyone.

946
01:15:49,401 --> 01:15:51,441
The gun triggered on its own..
- Dikshit, listen.

947
01:15:52,081 --> 01:15:53,761
We have to clean the area
and dispose the dead body.

948
01:15:53,881 --> 01:15:55,281
But how will we explain it
to the police?

949
01:15:55,361 --> 01:15:57,801
Who will explain that he fell down
and the gun triggered on its own..

950
01:15:58,961 --> 01:15:59,961
Keep quiet!

951
01:16:00,521 --> 01:16:02,881
Take care of my wife.
Don't tell her that..

952
01:16:09,361 --> 01:16:10,681
Shit! Police!

953
01:16:10,721 --> 01:16:13,041
Would you please calm down?
Let me check.

954
01:16:20,601 --> 01:16:22,441
Some elderly people
have come to meet you.

955
01:16:23,961 --> 01:16:25,721
Oh! They are Kavya's parents.

956
01:16:26,681 --> 01:16:28,881
Let me handle them. You handle
the dead body and hide somewhere.

957
01:16:34,561 --> 01:16:36,041
Greetings, ma'am!
- Greetings, sir!

958
01:16:36,081 --> 01:16:37,281
Hello!
- Welcome! Please come.

959
01:16:37,481 --> 01:16:41,281
We recognised it as your house.
It's the best in the locality.

960
01:16:41,481 --> 01:16:43,721
Thank you. - If you host the
Indian flag here, it will be great!

961
01:16:43,921 --> 01:16:45,561
Thank you.
Didn't Kavya come with you?

962
01:16:45,641 --> 01:16:48,041
No. We didn't bring her.
She keeps chit-chatting.

963
01:16:48,121 --> 01:16:49,481
We wouldn't be able
to talk properly.

964
01:16:49,561 --> 01:16:50,521
We came without letting her know.

965
01:16:50,721 --> 01:16:54,881
Here are some Laddus for you.
- Thank you. It's sweets again.

966
01:16:54,961 --> 01:16:56,121
Sir, no need to take off
your shoes.

967
01:16:56,281 --> 01:16:58,441
No.. Please come.
- Okay.

968
01:16:58,641 --> 01:16:59,961
Please come in.
Please.

969
01:17:00,041 --> 01:17:01,241
Wow!

970
01:17:01,441 --> 01:17:04,681
It's positive vibes all over!
- Thank you.

971
01:17:04,761 --> 01:17:06,321
And there is ample space.

972
01:17:06,361 --> 01:17:07,321
It's spacious.

973
01:17:08,561 --> 01:17:10,481
Isn't it too big?

974
01:17:10,521 --> 01:17:12,681
We must plan for the future, ma'am.

975
01:17:12,761 --> 01:17:14,561
There must be ample space
for the kids to play.

976
01:17:15,441 --> 01:17:17,801
I am very excited
to see your house. - Oh!

977
01:17:17,881 --> 01:17:19,201
Especially, your kitchen.

978
01:17:19,961 --> 01:17:22,841
Actually, I haven't cleaned
the kitchen today. So..

979
01:17:22,921 --> 01:17:24,521
How much more will you clean, dear?

980
01:17:25,081 --> 01:17:27,801
It looks clean
like a five-star hotel.

981
01:17:27,841 --> 01:17:31,041
When compared to Kavya's house,
this is a heaven.

982
01:17:31,081 --> 01:17:34,401
If you wouldn't show us,
we will see on our own. - Ma'am..

983
01:17:35,281 --> 01:17:36,801
Is it a bad time, dear?

984
01:17:36,881 --> 01:17:39,481
If you've some emergency,
we'll come some other day.

985
01:17:39,561 --> 01:17:40,921
What's there?
- Yes!

986
01:17:41,241 --> 01:17:43,401
No! Come, sir.
Come in, ma'am.

987
01:17:45,201 --> 01:17:46,241
This is the dining room.

988
01:17:46,481 --> 01:17:47,961
All the furniture here
is from Pottery Barn.

989
01:17:49,241 --> 01:17:50,681
This is my kitchen.

990
01:17:51,441 --> 01:17:53,761
All the items here
is of Crate and Barrel.

991
01:17:54,201 --> 01:17:57,081
I have a convection oven
with the cooking range.

992
01:17:57,561 --> 01:17:58,841
And there is a lot of storage.

993
01:17:59,681 --> 01:18:01,881
I have bought all these
during the thanksgiving sale.
I have bought all these
during the thanksgiving sale.

994
01:18:01,961 --> 01:18:03,641
I am loving it.
- Thank you, ma'am.

995
01:18:16,321 --> 01:18:18,121
Hey, I found it.

996
01:18:18,481 --> 01:18:19,881
I have been looking for it.

997
01:18:21,961 --> 01:18:24,481
For making the Rotis.
Come, sir. I will..

998
01:18:25,161 --> 01:18:26,281
I will take you upstairs.

999
01:18:26,801 --> 01:18:29,081
This doesn't look
like a bachelor's house.

1000
01:18:29,441 --> 01:18:31,961
It looks as if a family stays here.
- Is this the master bedroom?

1001
01:18:33,361 --> 01:18:34,361
No, sir!

1002
01:18:34,441 --> 01:18:35,681
I just got the pest control done
in this room.

1003
01:18:35,761 --> 01:18:37,481
Do you have allergy?
- No!

1004
01:18:38,041 --> 01:18:39,481
You can be allergic.
- Did you say pest control?

1005
01:18:39,601 --> 01:18:41,401
Are there cockroaches
even in America?

1006
01:18:41,561 --> 01:18:42,521
Yes, sir.
Especially, in Miami.

1007
01:18:44,481 --> 01:18:45,681
This is the upstairs.

1008
01:18:46,401 --> 01:18:47,361
That is the guest bedroom.

1009
01:18:47,441 --> 01:18:49,401
I am planning to turn that
into an entertainment room.

1010
01:18:50,561 --> 01:18:51,561
Come, I will show you.

1011
01:19:32,361 --> 01:19:33,481
Greetings, sir!

1012
01:19:37,841 --> 01:19:38,761
Dear.

1013
01:19:38,801 --> 01:19:41,321
What did you want
to speak to us?

1014
01:19:41,561 --> 01:19:43,081
In the car..

1015
01:19:43,561 --> 01:19:45,841
Yes!
- No, ma'am. Some other time.

1016
01:19:45,921 --> 01:19:49,721
I have some urgent work
in the office. I got to go.

1017
01:19:50,001 --> 01:19:51,161
We will talk about it
some other day.

1018
01:19:51,241 --> 01:19:52,241
Okay. No problem.

1019
01:19:53,321 --> 01:19:54,401
So, tell me quickly.

1020
01:19:55,161 --> 01:19:59,041
We are leaving for Kavya's
uncle's place in Toronto, today.

1021
01:19:59,321 --> 01:20:00,761
We may not get a chance later.
We may not get a chance later.

1022
01:20:01,081 --> 01:20:04,681
Actually, ma'am, such things
can't be told in haste. Come.

1023
01:20:04,761 --> 01:20:05,681
So, tell me, dear.

1024
01:20:06,201 --> 01:20:07,321
I am there with you.

1025
01:20:10,081 --> 01:20:11,961
Ma'am..
- Tell me.

1026
01:20:12,601 --> 01:20:15,161
Ma'am, I don't have parents.

1027
01:20:15,641 --> 01:20:17,801
I've no idea about what's a family.

1028
01:20:17,921 --> 01:20:19,241
I just have a dream.

1029
01:20:19,441 --> 01:20:21,441
Actually, I am a bit old fashioned.

1030
01:20:21,641 --> 01:20:23,721
So I want everything to be perfect.

1031
01:20:24,241 --> 01:20:25,761
Kavya is a very
good friend of mine.

1032
01:20:25,841 --> 01:20:27,881
And I think we have
a good chemistry..

1033
01:20:28,641 --> 01:20:32,201
It's a 'yes' from me..

1034
01:20:32,281 --> 01:20:34,041
I knew it!
Where have you been?

1035
01:20:34,121 --> 01:20:35,601
You missed out on a lot.
Where were you? - Come.

1036
01:20:35,681 --> 01:20:38,521
Let's go.
- Y-Yes..

1037
01:20:38,801 --> 01:20:40,081
You leave for office.

1038
01:20:40,441 --> 01:20:42,361
But do add me on WhatsApp.

1039
01:20:42,441 --> 01:20:45,401
Yes.. - Then we'll talk and chat.
- Of course. - Let's go.

1040
01:20:45,481 --> 01:20:47,281
Come on. - Yes..
- Let's go.

1041
01:20:48,001 --> 01:20:50,241
Bye, ma'am. Bye, sir.
- Bye.

1042
01:20:56,601 --> 01:20:59,441
I am trying to hide
the dead here

1043
01:20:59,641 --> 01:21:00,801
and you are fixing your marriage?
and you are fixing your marriage?

1044
01:21:01,721 --> 01:21:05,321
I am so impressed.
Gaurav is a nice guy.

1045
01:21:05,761 --> 01:21:07,041
Control your emotions.

1046
01:21:07,401 --> 01:21:09,521
I saw two gays in his bathroom.

1047
01:21:09,681 --> 01:21:11,481
Yes. They were bathing together.

1048
01:21:14,281 --> 01:21:16,241
But everything's legal here, right?

1049
01:21:17,401 --> 01:21:20,641
Gaurav bathes alone.
That's enough.

1050
01:21:20,721 --> 01:21:23,081
We don't have anything to do
with others.

1051
01:21:24,321 --> 01:21:26,641
What the hell is going on here?

1052
01:21:26,881 --> 01:21:28,681
Dix, I'll explain everything.

1053
01:21:29,321 --> 01:21:30,521
You just go home now.

1054
01:21:30,601 --> 01:21:32,081
Buzz off.
I'll dispose the body.

1055
01:21:32,161 --> 01:21:33,841
I need to get some things for that.

1056
01:21:34,081 --> 01:21:37,241
Buzz off? Dispose the body?
What are you saying?

1057
01:21:37,681 --> 01:21:38,921
What's happening here?
Who is this man?

1058
01:21:39,001 --> 01:21:40,201
How are you so relaxed?

1059
01:21:40,481 --> 01:21:44,601
Wait a minute.
Have you done this before?

1060
01:21:45,761 --> 01:21:48,641
Gaurav, who are you?

1061
01:21:48,881 --> 01:21:50,761
Dix, just go home.
I'll tell you everything.

1062
01:21:53,481 --> 01:21:56,721
I've hidden something from you.
There's more to my story.

1063
01:21:57,641 --> 01:21:58,441
Clearly.

1064
01:22:19,641 --> 01:22:21,081
Boss, he's late.

1065
01:22:42,441 --> 01:22:47,041
Welcome to the US of A, Mr. Yakub.
All right, pal!

1066
01:22:48,321 --> 01:22:50,521
I've been waiting here
since an hour.

1067
01:22:51,201 --> 01:22:52,321
And why have you got
this ambulance?

1068
01:22:52,441 --> 01:22:53,681
It's an awesome vehicle, boss.

1069
01:22:53,961 --> 01:22:55,241
It has four star safety ratings,
six air pillows

1070
01:22:56,441 --> 01:22:58,001
and automatic control.

1071
01:22:58,241 --> 01:23:00,561
Around five of your goons
can comfortably play cards
Around five of your goons
can comfortably play cards

1072
01:23:00,641 --> 01:23:01,641
inside this.
All right?

1073
01:23:02,001 --> 01:23:03,481
Did you get any information
about Rishi?

1074
01:23:03,561 --> 01:23:06,161
Boss, I've found Rishi.

1075
01:23:06,481 --> 01:23:09,521
I've told my men to follow him.

1076
01:23:10,161 --> 01:23:12,921
They'll grab him by the neck
and bring him.

1077
01:23:13,761 --> 01:23:15,241
You know what I mean, right?

1078
01:23:18,161 --> 01:23:19,201
What happened? But..

1079
01:23:19,761 --> 01:23:22,961
I just told you to find him
and not to catch him.

1080
01:23:23,041 --> 01:23:27,001
Boss, but catching
is a good thing, right?

1081
01:23:28,161 --> 01:23:29,801
Do you know who Rishi is?

1082
01:23:32,281 --> 01:23:36,801
My men are also good.
They're powerful.

1083
01:23:42,961 --> 01:23:45,601
Hey, Rishi!
- Hello!

1084
01:23:50,641 --> 01:23:52,281
I am sorry, are you talking to me?

1085
01:23:52,361 --> 01:23:54,921
Yes, Rishi.
Come. Come with us.

1086
01:23:55,001 --> 01:23:56,961
Wrong guy.
I am not Rishi.

1087
01:23:57,681 --> 01:23:59,441
When he called out Rishi

1088
01:23:59,521 --> 01:24:01,441
how did you hear that?
how did you hear that?

1089
01:24:02,001 --> 01:24:03,601
That means, you are Rishi.

1090
01:24:04,321 --> 01:24:06,481
I am sorry. I told you
that I'm the wrong guy.

1091
01:24:10,921 --> 01:24:14,841
Hey, stop. Just come along.
Or else you'll be beaten up.

1092
01:24:46,361 --> 01:24:48,361
You're too late, buddy.
- For what?

1093
01:24:48,441 --> 01:24:49,801
You should've taken it out by now.

1094
01:25:23,881 --> 01:25:24,761
Any coupons?

1095
01:26:11,241 --> 01:26:14,041
Rishi!
How are you, buddy?

1096
01:26:16,721 --> 01:26:18,201
You must be happy
to see me here, right?

1097
01:26:18,961 --> 01:26:20,321
Won't you invite me in?

1098
01:26:21,601 --> 01:26:23,681
Did you find my assistants?
They aren't picking my calls.

1099
01:26:26,281 --> 01:26:28,001
You've made a top class house.

1100
01:26:28,081 --> 01:26:32,841
Plants, garden and fountain.
Is there a darn dog too?

1101
01:26:34,001 --> 01:26:35,881
Just like your cheap dreams.

1102
01:26:36,121 --> 01:26:39,601
Awesome.
The property is top class.

1103
01:26:39,761 --> 01:26:42,201
Isn't it?
- How much did I search for you!

1104
01:26:43,361 --> 01:26:44,641
But you haven't been in touch.

1105
01:26:45,761 --> 01:26:49,361
Hey, please don't stamp
on the sofa. - Sorry.

1106
01:26:49,441 --> 01:26:54,401
You used to be an action hero
and now, you've become so homely!

1107
01:26:55,681 --> 01:26:57,321
What do you want, Yakub?

1108
01:26:57,641 --> 01:27:02,721
The one that you had taken.
Hard drive. Colonel's data.
The one that you had taken.
Hard drive. Colonel's data.

1109
01:27:02,881 --> 01:27:03,761
I don't have that data.

1110
01:27:03,841 --> 01:27:05,401
It was a long flight, Rishi.

1111
01:27:06,921 --> 01:27:08,921
And that too,
with a sobbing baby beside me.

1112
01:27:09,121 --> 01:27:11,321
So don't test my patience now.

1113
01:27:13,001 --> 01:27:15,201
The hard drive got destroyed
in the shootout.

1114
01:27:20,041 --> 01:27:21,441
Do you think I am a fool?

1115
01:27:28,441 --> 01:27:29,681
Be sensible.

1116
01:27:34,761 --> 01:27:35,561
She's my neighbour.

1117
01:27:35,641 --> 01:27:36,841
She comes here often
to borrow sugar.

1118
01:27:36,921 --> 01:27:40,081
She'll leave now.
- Sugar? - Gaurav!

1119
01:27:40,521 --> 01:27:41,801
Gaurav, open the door.

1120
01:27:41,921 --> 01:27:44,801
You talked to my parents
about our marriage!

1121
01:27:44,881 --> 01:27:47,521
That too, without asking me?
You're so dead, Gaurav.

1122
01:27:50,721 --> 01:27:52,561
She seems to be
a very close neighbour.

1123
01:27:55,361 --> 01:27:59,521
'Someone to love me
and someone that I would love.'

1124
01:28:00,241 --> 01:28:02,321
I haven't forgotten
what you'd said.

1125
01:28:03,241 --> 01:28:06,041
I'll kill you
if something happens to her.

1126
01:28:06,641 --> 01:28:08,481
So sweet.
- Look, Yakub.

1127
01:28:08,561 --> 01:28:11,001
She doesn't know anything about me.
She's a civilian.

1128
01:28:11,521 --> 01:28:12,721
The matter between us..

1129
01:28:14,801 --> 01:28:19,041
Gaurav.. Get up. Gaurav!

1130
01:28:21,881 --> 01:28:24,081
Okay, Gaurav.
Listen to me very carefully.

1131
01:28:24,441 --> 01:28:26,481
I've been kidnapped by someone.

1132
01:28:27,161 --> 01:28:29,401
At first I thought
someone was stealing my purse

1133
01:28:29,681 --> 01:28:31,881
but he kidnapped me instead.
That too, from your house.

1134
01:28:32,321 --> 01:28:36,521
He can be a serial killer.
There's no dearth of psychos in US.

1135
01:28:36,961 --> 01:28:39,201
He must be thinking
that I am a celebrity.

1136
01:28:40,681 --> 01:28:42,281
Such things often happen with me.

1137
01:28:42,401 --> 01:28:44,521
But why would they kidnap you?

1138
01:28:44,841 --> 01:28:46,161
May be they think you're my PA?

1139
01:28:47,401 --> 01:28:50,561
But still.. - Kavya.
- ...why PA? - Kavya..

1140
01:28:50,761 --> 01:28:51,961
We have to get out from here
as soon as possible.

1141
01:28:52,081 --> 01:28:54,161
Okay? - G-Gaurav, it's okay.
- So please.. - Relax.

1142
01:28:54,241 --> 01:28:56,921
I know you're scared.
Just trust me

1143
01:28:57,241 --> 01:28:59,881
I'll get you out safely from here.
Okay? - Okay.

1144
01:28:59,961 --> 01:29:03,001
Let me just free my hands first.
My wrists are quite slim.

1145
01:29:03,081 --> 01:29:04,441
Kavya, these are handcuffs
and not bangles.

1146
01:29:04,761 --> 01:29:07,001
Do you have a pin?
I'll try to open it. - What?

1147
01:29:07,241 --> 01:29:08,121
You can do that?

1148
01:29:13,401 --> 01:29:17,401
I think this will work.
- This?

1149
01:29:32,601 --> 01:29:35,641
Sorry..
- Hurry up! - Sorry..

1150
01:29:54,521 --> 01:29:55,841
Yes.

1151
01:30:04,201 --> 01:30:05,601
What the..

1152
01:30:07,081 --> 01:30:08,161
How did you do that?

1153
01:30:10,321 --> 01:30:11,681
Where did you learn this?

1154
01:30:11,961 --> 01:30:12,841
Come, let's go.

1155
01:30:13,081 --> 01:30:14,841
You guys are wasting your time.

1156
01:30:14,921 --> 01:30:16,201
You will not find anything
over here.

1157
01:30:16,521 --> 01:30:20,161
He's not an imbecile to leave
the hard drive at home.

1158
01:30:20,241 --> 01:30:21,281
You do know the meaning
of imbecile, right?

1159
01:30:21,481 --> 01:30:22,641
It means moron.

1160
01:30:25,441 --> 01:30:28,041
Hard drive?
There's a hole in it.

1161
01:30:29,001 --> 01:30:30,041
Is it fixable?

1162
01:30:31,321 --> 01:30:32,681
This is a dead body.

1163
01:31:13,441 --> 01:31:14,521
No, don't go..

1164
01:31:30,801 --> 01:31:31,841
Oh, my God!

1165
01:31:32,441 --> 01:31:34,361
Gaurav, what the..

1166
01:31:58,321 --> 01:31:59,561
D-Don't..

1167
01:32:16,601 --> 01:32:18,001
Gaurav, are you okay?

1168
01:32:21,801 --> 01:32:23,401
Gaurav, wait..

1169
01:32:43,401 --> 01:32:44,481
Gaurav, get him!

1170
01:32:50,401 --> 01:32:52,161
Oh, my God!

1171
01:32:52,481 --> 01:32:55,361
Gaurav!
Okay..

1172
01:33:05,601 --> 01:33:07,721
"My gun is my love."

1173
01:33:14,961 --> 01:33:16,561
"My gun is my love."

1174
01:33:16,641 --> 01:33:18,961
"Oh, girl, you seem like
a daughter of Beretta."

1175
01:33:19,041 --> 01:33:21,401
"When I saw you,
the belt tightened."

1176
01:33:21,481 --> 01:33:23,521
"I'll take a bullet
to my chest for you."

1177
01:33:23,601 --> 01:33:25,881
"Why do you dodge me?"

1178
01:33:25,961 --> 01:33:28,361
"I can't take my
eyes off your body."- No!

1179
01:33:28,441 --> 01:33:30,521
"My finger goes straight
to the trigger."

1180
01:33:30,681 --> 01:33:32,841
"When I aimed at your eyes"

1181
01:33:32,921 --> 01:33:35,401
"they started calling me
a shooter at home."

1182
01:33:35,481 --> 01:33:37,361
"Be my lover.
Please be my lover."

1183
01:33:37,441 --> 01:33:39,601
"Be my lover.
Please be my lover."

1184
01:33:39,681 --> 01:33:42,001
"Be my lover.
Please be my lover."

1185
01:33:42,081 --> 01:33:45,001
"I'm the target.
- My gun is my love."

1186
01:33:47,321 --> 01:33:48,401
You can do that as well.

1187
01:33:57,321 --> 01:33:59,241
Get inside, quickly.
- No.

1188
01:34:00,201 --> 01:34:01,801
First you need to tell me
what's happening, Gaurav.

1189
01:34:02,641 --> 01:34:03,521
Kavya, I..

1190
01:34:04,601 --> 01:34:05,681
Can we get out of here?

1191
01:34:06,281 --> 01:34:08,321
I will explain everything
on the way. Please?

1192
01:34:10,081 --> 01:34:11,761
"My girl surprises me
with astonishing moves."

1193
01:34:11,841 --> 01:34:14,601
"I am stuck in very deep,
you are my first love."

1194
01:34:14,841 --> 01:34:16,521
"Oh, girl, I remember your talks."

1195
01:34:16,601 --> 01:34:19,121
"You used to scold me
when I used to stay out for long."

1196
01:34:19,401 --> 01:34:23,441
"I will be home early,
just be patient and have no fear."

1197
01:34:23,841 --> 01:34:28,121
"I will start working from home
if you become my wife."

1198
01:34:37,601 --> 01:34:40,121
A pack of hounds
are more reliable than you.

1199
01:34:41,161 --> 01:34:42,161
Morons!

1200
01:34:42,561 --> 01:34:44,241
You couldn't manage things
for 10 minutes without me!

1201
01:34:44,321 --> 01:34:45,361
Couldn't you?

1202
01:34:46,921 --> 01:34:47,921
Okay.

1203
01:34:48,201 --> 01:34:50,401
What!
Oh, my God!

1204
01:34:50,961 --> 01:34:51,961
Okay..

1205
01:34:52,841 --> 01:34:54,121
So, you have killed a person.

1206
01:34:56,921 --> 01:34:58,001
No!

1207
01:35:02,081 --> 01:35:03,281
Have you killed a lot of people?

1208
01:35:04,601 --> 01:35:05,641
What!

1209
01:35:05,721 --> 01:35:06,761
Oh, my God!

1210
01:35:09,001 --> 01:35:11,081
I am sure that they
were bad people, right?

1211
01:35:13,681 --> 01:35:15,201
Mostly.
- Mostly?

1212
01:35:15,281 --> 01:35:16,441
Oh, my God!

1213
01:35:16,681 --> 01:35:17,761
Oh, my God!
- Listen..

1214
01:35:17,841 --> 01:35:19,881
Oh, my God!
- Listen.. Listen to me, Kavya.

1215
01:35:20,721 --> 01:35:21,601
I didn't tell you earlier

1216
01:35:21,681 --> 01:35:22,961
because I was afraid
that you will run away.

1217
01:35:23,041 --> 01:35:24,321
Don't touch me!

1218
01:35:27,161 --> 01:35:28,721
I didn't choose that life myself.

1219
01:35:28,801 --> 01:35:30,401
I was just a kid
when I got into those things.

1220
01:35:31,641 --> 01:35:33,761
Nobody taught me the difference
between the right and the wrong.

1221
01:35:35,241 --> 01:35:37,281
I never had a home,
parents or a family.

1222
01:35:37,601 --> 01:35:39,521
Do you know that I have
worked very hard to get here?

1223
01:35:39,801 --> 01:35:42,521
I have come so far
looking for a normal life.

1224
01:35:45,041 --> 01:35:46,521
I just wanted to have a home.

1225
01:35:48,401 --> 01:35:49,521
And a family.

1226
01:35:53,721 --> 01:35:54,961
I guess, it's not that easy.

1227
01:35:59,281 --> 01:36:00,921
Should I call you Gaurav or Rishi?
Should I call you Gaurav or Rishi?

1228
01:36:08,881 --> 01:36:12,081
"I will love you
without any limits."

1229
01:36:12,561 --> 01:36:15,361
"Even if I wish"

1230
01:36:15,441 --> 01:36:22,481
"I can't stay away from you
even for a moment."

1231
01:36:24,001 --> 01:36:31,281
"Even though our paths
are different"

1232
01:36:31,361 --> 01:36:38,281
"let me connect our destinations."

1233
01:36:40,281 --> 01:36:47,561
"This bond between us"

1234
01:36:47,961 --> 01:36:52,841
"I hope it never breaks."

1235
01:36:53,601 --> 01:36:57,481
"May this connection
between us never break."

1236
01:36:57,561 --> 01:37:01,121
"May this connection
between us never break."
"May this connection
between us never break."

1237
01:37:01,361 --> 01:37:05,121
"May this connection
between us never break."

1238
01:37:05,201 --> 01:37:08,601
"May this connection
between us never break."

1239
01:37:09,001 --> 01:37:12,801
"May this connection
between us never break."

1240
01:37:12,881 --> 01:37:16,481
"May this connection
between us never break."

1241
01:37:16,801 --> 01:37:20,361
"May this connection
between us never break."

1242
01:37:20,441 --> 01:37:24,161
"May this connection
between us never break."

1243
01:37:26,361 --> 01:37:33,761
"This bond between us"

1244
01:37:34,001 --> 01:37:39,001
"I hope that it never breaks."

1245
01:37:39,761 --> 01:37:43,521
"May this connection
between us never break."

1246
01:37:43,601 --> 01:37:47,241
"May this connection
between us never break."

1247
01:37:47,481 --> 01:37:51,161
"May this connection
between us never break."

1248
01:37:51,241 --> 01:37:54,801
"May this connection
between us never break."

1249
01:37:55,121 --> 01:37:59,281
"May this connection
between us never break."

1250
01:37:59,361 --> 01:38:03,281
"May this connection
between us never break."
"May this connection
between us never break."

1251
01:38:12,881 --> 01:38:14,881
Kavya! Kavya!

1252
01:38:17,201 --> 01:38:18,321
We have to leave.

1253
01:38:19,201 --> 01:38:20,201
What happened?

1254
01:38:21,121 --> 01:38:22,361
Those people are
the members of Unit X.

1255
01:38:22,441 --> 01:38:23,601
They are highly trained
professionals.

1256
01:38:23,681 --> 01:38:24,841
They will be here very soon.

1257
01:38:28,081 --> 01:38:29,241
Shit!

1258
01:38:32,641 --> 01:38:34,081
Come on,
let's get you out of here.

1259
01:38:38,761 --> 01:38:40,921
Kavya, I am sorry
for getting you involved in this.

1260
01:38:41,081 --> 01:38:43,441
These people can go to any extent.
I don't want you to get hurt.

1261
01:38:43,521 --> 01:38:44,721
Do you have to go back?

1262
01:38:44,801 --> 01:38:45,841
I have been running away
for too long.

1263
01:38:46,201 --> 01:38:48,201
They will not stop
until they find me.

1264
01:38:48,721 --> 01:38:51,481
I started this and I am
going to put an end to it.

1265
01:39:08,161 --> 01:39:09,201
Yakub.

1266
01:39:10,201 --> 01:39:11,401
Listen to me carefully.

1267
01:39:12,441 --> 01:39:13,801
There's another way
to obtain that data.

1268
01:39:19,521 --> 01:39:21,001
You don't know the entire story.

1269
01:39:21,201 --> 01:39:22,561
Do you know the contents
of that drive?

1270
01:39:23,921 --> 01:39:25,281
Do you know why
Colonel wants it so badly?

1271
01:39:25,841 --> 01:39:27,561
The real Gaurav
was a database manager

1272
01:39:27,641 --> 01:39:29,361
in a weapon manufacturing
company called as Norcorp.

1273
01:39:29,561 --> 01:39:31,801
It's very normal for these
companies to have classified files.

1274
01:39:31,881 --> 01:39:33,641
But Gaurav found something
abnormal that day.

1275
01:39:34,201 --> 01:39:35,601
He found illegal
financial transactions.

1276
01:39:35,681 --> 01:39:37,681
He found kickbacks worth billions

1277
01:39:37,761 --> 01:39:38,961
between Indian politicians
and Norcorp.

1278
01:39:39,041 --> 01:39:41,041
He also found the details
about their offshore accounts.

1279
01:39:41,801 --> 01:39:43,441
He should have handed over
this information to the police.

1280
01:39:43,681 --> 01:39:45,241
But Gaurav wanted to take
advantage of this situation.

1281
01:39:47,521 --> 01:39:49,801
He consolidated the data.
He quit the job.

1282
01:39:50,361 --> 01:39:51,761
And he started looking for a buyer.
- 'Yes, Mishra speaking.'

1283
01:39:51,841 --> 01:39:53,841
That buyer was Mishra,
the defence secretary.

1284
01:39:53,921 --> 01:39:55,681
'I have some information.'
- The deal was finalised.

1285
01:39:56,121 --> 01:39:58,281
He wanted 11 million dollars
in exchange for the data.

1286
01:39:58,841 --> 01:40:00,601
That data contains information
about Colonel as well.
That data contains information
about Colonel as well.

1287
01:40:01,201 --> 01:40:02,801
If the data leaks,
Colonel is a dead meat.

1288
01:40:05,561 --> 01:40:07,201
So that's why the Colonel
is so desperate for it.

1289
01:40:09,281 --> 01:40:10,241
My life was at stake.

1290
01:40:11,161 --> 01:40:12,321
Because the drive was destroyed.

1291
01:40:13,681 --> 01:40:15,161
But I had Gaurav's laptop with me.

1292
01:40:16,041 --> 01:40:17,281
I retrieved a program from it.

1293
01:40:18,441 --> 01:40:20,961
With the help of this program
we can retrieve the data.

1294
01:40:26,441 --> 01:40:27,561
So, the data is still available?

1295
01:40:27,761 --> 01:40:29,561
Yes, in the Norcorp's servers.

1296
01:40:30,601 --> 01:40:32,041
You have only one option
with you then.

1297
01:40:32,601 --> 01:40:34,081
Extract the data from the server
and hand it over to me.

1298
01:40:34,601 --> 01:40:38,201
Then I will set you
and your lovebird free.

1299
01:40:38,761 --> 01:40:40,241
And if I am not wrong

1300
01:40:40,441 --> 01:40:42,481
you already have a plan
to extract the data.

1301
01:40:45,601 --> 01:40:48,561
Norcorp Tower has 60 floors.
And the Server Room is on the 36th.

1302
01:40:49,561 --> 01:40:52,561
Their security system is top-notch.
It's impossible to breach it.

1303
01:40:53,161 --> 01:40:54,961
But things are different
at the maintenance entry.

1304
01:40:55,121 --> 01:40:56,521
We can easily
get to the roof from there.

1305
01:40:56,561 --> 01:40:58,121
The way to get to the Server Room
from the roof..

1306
01:40:58,601 --> 01:40:59,441
Leave that to me.

1307
01:40:59,601 --> 01:41:00,921
We should undertake
this mission on Sunday.
We should undertake
this mission on Sunday.

1308
01:41:01,121 --> 01:41:02,601
Because offices will be shut and
the staff will be less in number.

1309
01:41:04,041 --> 01:41:04,841
Listen, Yakub.

1310
01:41:05,121 --> 01:41:06,401
Colonel has been using us
since we were kids.

1311
01:41:06,761 --> 01:41:07,641
You too know that.

1312
01:41:07,881 --> 01:41:09,401
There is evidence against Colonel
in this data.

1313
01:41:10,041 --> 01:41:12,441
Yakub, this is your final chance
for the redemption.

1314
01:41:13,321 --> 01:41:14,161
And to get your freedom.

1315
01:41:15,001 --> 01:41:16,201
I will get you the data

1316
01:41:16,681 --> 01:41:19,441
but I want you to decide
what to do with it.

1317
01:41:22,321 --> 01:41:24,281
All right.
Let's do this one last operation

1318
01:41:25,081 --> 01:41:28,121
together, like old times.

1319
01:42:03,481 --> 01:42:04,481
Yes?

1320
01:42:07,401 --> 01:42:08,681
Rishi, Unit X.

1321
01:42:14,881 --> 01:42:17,241
Gaurav, wait..

1322
01:42:18,161 --> 01:42:19,001
Dude, where were you?

1323
01:42:19,201 --> 01:42:21,561
You didn't come to office
ever since..

1324
01:42:22,681 --> 01:42:23,841
You have been giving me
sleepless nights.

1325
01:42:25,561 --> 01:42:26,361
I am sorry, Dix.

1326
01:42:26,601 --> 01:42:28,681
You got into such mess
because of me. - No..

1327
01:42:30,961 --> 01:42:33,201
I am feeling more alive
since the day I killed him.

1328
01:42:34,561 --> 01:42:35,521
It's crazy, you know.

1329
01:42:35,881 --> 01:42:37,241
I don't drink coffee
at office anymore.

1330
01:42:38,241 --> 01:42:39,201
I am the best
in the spinning class.

1331
01:42:39,281 --> 01:42:41,721
My wife looks up to me now.

1332
01:42:43,361 --> 01:42:45,281
It's not like I want to kill
anyone again though.

1333
01:42:45,801 --> 01:42:46,881
You know how I feel, don't you?

1334
01:42:47,961 --> 01:42:48,921
Make me your partner.

1335
01:42:49,361 --> 01:42:51,561
I want to be a part
of any job that you do.

1336
01:42:52,321 --> 01:42:54,241
Half-murder, kidnapping, heist.

1337
01:42:55,081 --> 01:42:57,561
Just tell me when to get started.
I want the bloody thug life!

1338
01:42:57,801 --> 01:42:59,241
You have no idea
what's going on here.

1339
01:42:59,641 --> 01:43:01,041
Better stay away from it.
Better stay away from it.

1340
01:43:01,241 --> 01:43:02,481
You are underestimating me, dude.

1341
01:43:03,041 --> 01:43:05,801
Just give me a chance, please.
I can kill for you.

1342
01:43:34,241 --> 01:43:37,441
Get it done!
Quick!

1343
01:43:39,801 --> 01:43:41,321
Nineteen..

1344
01:43:48,761 --> 01:43:49,601
Check.

1345
01:44:57,441 --> 01:44:58,361
Oh, my God!

1346
01:45:03,681 --> 01:45:05,601
Yakub, I am in.
- Copy that.

1347
01:45:19,401 --> 01:45:20,281
Stop!

1348
01:45:20,361 --> 01:45:21,441
What?
- Road closed.

1349
01:45:22,081 --> 01:45:24,401
Road closed. Big gas leak.
No. - Oh!

1350
01:45:48,041 --> 01:45:49,241
I am going to login
in nine seconds.

1351
01:45:57,201 --> 01:45:58,641
Someone just logged
into the server.

1352
01:45:58,841 --> 01:45:59,801
Shit! They got an alert.

1353
01:45:59,881 --> 01:46:01,681
I need more time.
- Make it fast!
I need more time.
- Make it fast!

1354
01:46:05,481 --> 01:46:07,441
Check server room 1.
- Copy that.

1355
01:46:14,441 --> 01:46:15,521
Look there..

1356
01:46:23,201 --> 01:46:24,641
Yakub, I won't be able
to make it to the roof.

1357
01:46:25,361 --> 01:46:27,961
What!
- There!

1358
01:46:28,201 --> 01:46:29,081
Stop!

1359
01:46:30,641 --> 01:46:31,921
Jignesh.
- Yes.

1360
01:46:32,321 --> 01:46:34,001
There's a change in plan.
Leave now.

1361
01:46:37,241 --> 01:46:38,761
Hey, catch.

1362
01:46:42,961 --> 01:46:45,681
You are supposed to do this
when someone says catch!

1363
01:46:57,401 --> 01:46:58,321
You..

1364
01:46:59,281 --> 01:47:01,241
Freeze! Put your hands up
so we can see them.
Freeze! Put your hands up
so we can see them.

1365
01:47:06,721 --> 01:47:08,801
Abort. I said, abort.

1366
01:47:08,881 --> 01:47:11,681
He said, abort.
Abort, let's go.

1367
01:47:11,761 --> 01:47:13,201
Move.. Meet me at the gate.

1368
01:47:31,201 --> 01:47:32,121
Working on weekends.

1369
01:47:32,761 --> 01:47:34,201
Same shit, different day.

1370
01:47:50,121 --> 01:47:51,041
Hey!

1371
01:47:51,641 --> 01:47:52,721
Found him!

1372
01:48:00,921 --> 01:48:02,281
Go that way.
Rest with me.

1373
01:48:03,121 --> 01:48:03,961
Cut him around that corner.

1374
01:48:04,161 --> 01:48:05,121
There he is.

1375
01:48:18,081 --> 01:48:19,761
He's on the move.
Shoot him!

1376
01:48:52,961 --> 01:48:53,841
To hell with my life.

1377
01:49:02,881 --> 01:49:05,001
He jumped out of the building.
Follow him.

1378
01:49:25,921 --> 01:49:27,161
Get in..
- Go..

1379
01:49:29,761 --> 01:49:30,561
Seat belt, please.

1380
01:49:31,881 --> 01:49:32,881
Careful! Watch out..

1381
01:49:36,481 --> 01:49:37,961
Not bad.
- Thank you.

1382
01:49:40,161 --> 01:49:41,241
No.. Watch out.

1383
01:49:49,561 --> 01:49:51,601
Shit! They are getting closer.
Okay, take a.. - Hang on!

1384
01:50:04,201 --> 01:50:05,481
I'm sorry.

1385
01:50:08,361 --> 01:50:09,441
It's okay.

1386
01:50:12,401 --> 01:50:13,921
Where did you learn driving?

1387
01:50:14,721 --> 01:50:15,641
Xbox.

1388
01:50:25,401 --> 01:50:26,681
I think we should move from here.

1389
01:50:28,401 --> 01:50:29,961
Let's go straight.
- Are you sure?

1390
01:50:30,281 --> 01:50:31,401
What about your minivan?

1391
01:50:33,201 --> 01:50:34,801
Okay.
Let's do this.

1392
01:50:37,601 --> 01:50:38,761
Oh! I'm sorry.

1393
01:50:59,161 --> 01:51:01,841
Oh.. - I had taken a resolution
to not use it again
Oh.. - I had taken a resolution
to not use it again

1394
01:51:02,481 --> 01:51:03,761
and not to even keep it at home.

1395
01:51:04,841 --> 01:51:07,281
Do you know how to use it?
- This is America.

1396
01:51:10,721 --> 01:51:13,601
Okay. Go upstairs
and wait for my signal.

1397
01:51:13,761 --> 01:51:15,721
As soon as you get my signal,
just shoot. - Oh!

1398
01:51:16,161 --> 01:51:19,041
Whom should I shoot? - Nobody.
And not me for sure.

1399
01:51:19,321 --> 01:51:20,801
Just cover fire me, okay?

1400
01:51:22,041 --> 01:51:23,041
So, what's the signal?

1401
01:51:24,001 --> 01:51:24,841
I'll whistle.

1402
01:51:25,561 --> 01:51:26,761
What am I, a dog?

1403
01:51:27,481 --> 01:51:28,601
You tell me then.

1404
01:51:28,681 --> 01:51:31,081
Let's do something cool,
like commandos. Let's roll!

1405
01:51:32,001 --> 01:51:34,241
What?
- Let's rock and roll.

1406
01:51:35,081 --> 01:51:36,161
I think the whistle
was a better idea.

1407
01:51:37,481 --> 01:51:40,641
You know what?
You should call out for help.

1408
01:51:41,921 --> 01:51:42,921
Seriously?

1409
01:51:43,001 --> 01:51:46,601
I'm helping you. And you
shouldn't feel shy to ask for help.

1410
01:51:48,121 --> 01:51:49,561
So, the signal is..
- Kavya, listen..

1411
01:51:55,241 --> 01:51:56,761
You go upstairs and hide.
- Crap.

1412
01:52:03,481 --> 01:52:06,201
So, you've come back as usual.
- And you're late as always.

1413
01:52:07,241 --> 01:52:08,761
Each one of us is different.

1414
01:52:10,521 --> 01:52:11,761
Data?

1415
01:52:15,161 --> 01:52:18,521
We're done, right?
- What's the hurry, buddy?

1416
01:52:29,481 --> 01:52:30,961
Yakub, don't play around like this.

1417
01:52:34,481 --> 01:52:38,241
We have a lot of time to pass,
until Colonel arrives.

1418
01:52:41,481 --> 01:52:45,841
That's your father and my father,
who gave us a new life.

1419
01:52:47,601 --> 01:52:49,241
It's your last chance
to live according to your wish.

1420
01:52:49,321 --> 01:52:54,521
Get lost! That's your problem.
I'm happy with where I am.

1421
01:52:58,121 --> 01:52:58,921
Let's roll.

1422
01:53:03,561 --> 01:53:04,521
Let's rock and roll.

1423
01:53:12,521 --> 01:53:13,721
Help!

1424
01:53:22,041 --> 01:53:23,641
Hide yourself.

1425
01:53:23,841 --> 01:53:25,401
Oh, God!

1426
01:53:35,841 --> 01:53:37,321
This is too much of violence.

1427
01:54:07,761 --> 01:54:12,161
Always hide the gun
inside your underwear.

1428
01:54:12,481 --> 01:54:13,881
Then it'll never fall down, right?

1429
01:54:14,001 --> 01:54:15,081
Come out, Rishi.

1430
01:54:19,241 --> 01:54:20,521
You wanted a family, didn't you?

1431
01:54:20,921 --> 01:54:22,161
We were your family.

1432
01:54:22,801 --> 01:54:25,281
And today,
you are out to destroy us.

1433
01:54:29,601 --> 01:54:31,681
Look, Rishi,
your dream is being shattered.

1434
01:54:33,121 --> 01:54:34,481
Come out.

1435
01:54:46,641 --> 01:54:51,081
Come out, Rishi, or you'll be
killed along with that girl.

1436
01:55:30,561 --> 01:55:32,881
I swear..
Look at what I'm going to do.

1437
01:55:43,801 --> 01:55:44,721
Come on.

1438
01:55:47,241 --> 01:55:48,441
Faster..

1439
01:56:49,321 --> 01:56:51,601
Pick up your stuff and get lost.
Take this.

1440
01:56:52,641 --> 01:56:54,081
Get the fuck out of my house.

1441
01:57:00,441 --> 01:57:02,961
Oh, my God, Gaurav.
Look at your house.

1442
01:57:04,401 --> 01:57:06,081
At least,
all this has come to an end.

1443
01:57:08,281 --> 01:57:10,321
As long as Unit X exists,
nothing has ended.

1444
01:57:16,961 --> 01:57:19,961
Dikshit, we are on.
Be safe. - Hey..

1445
01:57:26,001 --> 01:57:28,201
I didn't understand something.

1446
01:57:28,361 --> 01:57:29,561
Since Rishi has given us the drive

1447
01:57:29,801 --> 01:57:31,121
and it was his foolishness.

1448
01:57:31,281 --> 01:57:34,481
So, he isn't safe anymore.
Why don't we go and finish him?

1449
01:57:34,961 --> 01:57:36,521
He isn't a fool.

1450
01:57:43,721 --> 01:57:44,721
Oh, no!

1451
01:57:46,321 --> 01:57:48,241
Damn it! It's empty.

1452
01:57:48,761 --> 01:57:50,761
Rishi, from Unit X.

1453
01:57:51,641 --> 01:57:53,121
Rishi, where are you?

1454
01:58:04,241 --> 01:58:05,321
Thank you.

1455
01:58:05,801 --> 01:58:06,681
Take a U-turn.

1456
01:58:36,081 --> 01:58:38,161
I'm extremely sorry, sir.
Oh! He's an Indian.

1457
01:58:38,881 --> 01:58:41,121
I'm sorry, mister.
It was a minor one.

1458
01:58:42,521 --> 01:58:43,721
Hey, is everything okay here?

1459
01:58:47,361 --> 01:58:48,681
"Who's your daddy now?"

1460
01:58:51,081 --> 01:58:53,441
Sir, open the trunk please.

1461
01:58:56,001 --> 01:58:57,081
Check the place.

1462
01:59:00,281 --> 01:59:01,241
Oh, shit!

1463
01:59:12,241 --> 01:59:13,281
Yes..

1464
01:59:13,521 --> 01:59:15,761
I had gone very far
from you and your world.

1465
01:59:16,881 --> 01:59:18,641
I just wanted a life of my own.

1466
01:59:19,001 --> 01:59:20,481
But you will never leave me alone,
right?

1467
01:59:21,601 --> 01:59:22,681
Never!

1468
01:59:33,121 --> 01:59:33,961
Goodbye, Colonel.

1469
01:59:37,881 --> 01:59:41,001
'The wind is strong, Dinkar Rao.
Mind your hat.'

1470
01:59:52,641 --> 01:59:53,841
Do you need to pick up something
from home?

1471
01:59:55,161 --> 01:59:57,401
Not really.
- Did your parents leave?

1472
01:59:57,881 --> 01:59:58,721
Yes.

1473
01:59:59,121 --> 02:00:01,441
In Gaurav's account,
which means in my account
In Gaurav's account,
which means in my account

1474
02:00:01,841 --> 02:00:03,121
there's 11 million dollars

1475
02:00:04,001 --> 02:00:08,161
some old memories
and two new passports.

1476
02:00:10,281 --> 02:00:11,321
Tell me, where do you want to go?

1477
02:00:12,161 --> 02:00:13,321
Hemanth Khanna..

1478
02:00:14,721 --> 02:00:15,841
Oh! Pooja Khanna.

1479
02:00:17,601 --> 02:00:18,681
Brother and sister?

1480
02:00:19,881 --> 02:00:21,841
You should've at least
thought of some cool names.

1481
02:00:21,921 --> 02:00:23,281
Next time, you decide.

1482
02:00:24,361 --> 02:00:25,481
One more thing.

1483
02:00:34,801 --> 02:00:36,521
I'm not in a hurry.
Think about it.

1484
02:00:41,721 --> 02:00:42,761
Fasten your seat belt, please.

1485
02:00:45,041 --> 02:00:46,121
Crap.

1486
02:01:16,041 --> 02:01:20,601
"This fancy girl,
dances like a tornado."

1487
02:01:20,681 --> 02:01:23,441
"Her moves are splendid."

1488
02:01:24,641 --> 02:01:26,481
"She's always
alert like an alarm."

1489
02:01:26,721 --> 02:01:28,401
"Doesn't keep calm
even for a minute."

1490
02:01:28,681 --> 02:01:31,401
"She's the life of the club."

1491
02:01:31,801 --> 02:01:36,081
"Come, let's light up this place."

1492
02:01:36,521 --> 02:01:39,841
"Let's drop the beat and dance."

1493
02:01:39,921 --> 02:01:43,841
"The heart says disco all night.."

1494
02:01:44,041 --> 02:01:46,921
"The heart says disco
all night.."

1495
02:01:47,921 --> 02:01:50,641
"The heart says disco
all night.."

1496
02:01:52,201 --> 02:01:53,321
"Disco.."

1497
02:01:55,961 --> 02:01:57,201
"Disco.."

1498
02:01:59,921 --> 02:02:03,721
"Come,
let us light up this place."
"Come,
let us light up this place."

1499
02:02:04,201 --> 02:02:07,521
"Come,
let us light up this place."

1500
02:02:07,641 --> 02:02:11,441
"The heart says disco
all night.."

1501
02:02:11,601 --> 02:02:15,281
"The heart says disco
all night.."

1502
02:02:15,521 --> 02:02:19,241
"The heart says disco
all night.."

1503
02:02:23,561 --> 02:02:25,441
"Move and roll,
let there be no control"

1504
02:02:25,641 --> 02:02:27,161
"make the floor yours."

1505
02:02:27,721 --> 02:02:30,881
"Let this flow not stop.."

1506
02:02:31,521 --> 02:02:33,401
"Come on, show me,
what you are capable of."

1507
02:02:33,481 --> 02:02:35,201
"Why to keep anything
within the heart?"

1508
02:02:35,521 --> 02:02:38,961
"Come and dance with me today."

1509
02:02:39,121 --> 02:02:40,921
"With this passion
and this fashion."

1510
02:02:40,961 --> 02:02:42,841
"I'll impress everyone"

1511
02:02:42,961 --> 02:02:47,041
"If I dance till I drop today."

1512
02:02:47,201 --> 02:02:49,121
"Let's get everyone dancing"

1513
02:02:49,281 --> 02:02:51,041
"don't spare anyone."

1514
02:02:51,321 --> 02:02:54,721
"Let's dance in the air,
and not even touch the floor."

1515
02:02:54,921 --> 02:02:58,761
"The heart says disco.."

1516
02:02:58,921 --> 02:03:02,881
"The heart says disco
all night.."
"The heart says disco
all night.."

1517
02:03:03,081 --> 02:03:06,441
"The heart says disco
all night.."

1518
02:03:06,681 --> 02:03:10,361
"The heart says disco
all night.."

1519
02:03:10,721 --> 02:03:11,721
"Disco.."

1520
02:03:14,681 --> 02:03:15,681
"Disco.."

1521
02:03:18,881 --> 02:03:19,881
"Disco.."

1522
02:03:22,361 --> 02:03:23,841
"The heart says disco.."

1523
02:03:27,481 --> 02:03:29,801
How much is that one?
- 650 dollars.

1524
02:03:30,201 --> 02:03:32,401
Does that come in red?
- No, it only comes in blue.

1525
02:03:33,201 --> 02:03:35,241
Does this come in a bigger size?
- Yes.

1526
02:03:35,681 --> 02:03:37,881
And what's the return policy?
- No returns.

1527
02:03:39,081 --> 02:03:40,121
Are bullets free?

1528
02:03:40,761 --> 02:03:42,641
No, but I'll give you discount.

1529
02:03:42,761 --> 02:03:44,321
"My gun is my love."

1530
02:03:51,761 --> 02:03:53,441
"My gun is my love."

1531
02:03:53,521 --> 02:03:55,481
"Be my beloved.."

1532
02:03:55,601 --> 02:03:57,801
"Be my beloved.."

1533
02:03:57,881 --> 02:04:00,041
"Be my beloved.."
"Be my beloved.."

1534
02:04:00,321 --> 02:04:02,801
"I'm the target.
- My gun is my love."

1535
02:04:02,881 --> 02:04:05,001
"Oh, girl, you seem like
a daughter of Beretta."

1536
02:04:05,241 --> 02:04:07,241
"When I saw you,
the belt tightened."

1537
02:04:07,681 --> 02:04:09,441
"I'll take a bullet to my chest
for you"

1538
02:04:09,601 --> 02:04:12,041
"then why do you dodge me?"

1539
02:04:12,161 --> 02:04:14,281
"I can't move my eyes
from your figure"

1540
02:04:14,521 --> 02:04:16,641
"my finger goes straight
to the trigger."

1541
02:04:16,841 --> 02:04:18,801
"When I aimed at your eyes,
oh, beloved."

1542
02:04:18,921 --> 02:04:21,001
"People started calling me
