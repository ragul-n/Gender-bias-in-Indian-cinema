3
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:22,390
Artistes needed for the stage.
Inquire inside.

4
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,750
- Where's the manager?
- This way.

5
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,760
- What happened?
- Nothing!

6
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:39,640
Manager says I can't sing.
His daughter says, nor will I ever learn.

7
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,810
- What has the daughter to do with this?
- Why not?

8
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:44,750
She's the diva of the theater.

9
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,400
Her word counts.

10
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:51,370
- Witch!
- Hey. What are you doing?

11
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:57,970
I've told you,
you're not fit to act on stage.

12
00:02:58,290 --> 00:02:59,590
Too young.

13
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:02,290
And we need women.

14
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:03,950
Send Miss Kanta in.

15
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:06,340
Please, Miss. We are very poor.

16
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:08,980
Just hear me sing.
You'll like it.

17
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,280
What does 'liking' have to do with it?

18
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,060
We can't employ you.

19
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,680
- Please, Miss.
- Listen.

20
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,460
Stop being stubborn.

21
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:19,700
Go home. Tell your parents
to send you to school.

22
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:22,950
Why would I come here
if I had parents?

23
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:26,230
What can I do?
We aren't doing charity here.

24
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,170
But I haven't come for charity.

25
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:30,090
I want a job.

26
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:33,000
I could be an employee
among so many.

27
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,800
Yes, they all say that.

28
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,570
Run along. Go!

29
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:45,810
If not mine,
what about my sister's song?

30
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:47,710
- Sister?
- Yes!

31
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:50,560
I can fetch her.
She works as a servant.

32
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:57,940
She's better off there.
Send Miss Kanta in.

33
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,130
My sister's a great singer.

34
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:03,330
- Better than me.
- Just go. - Okay.

35
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,950
Wait.

36
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,170
Take. Eat something.

37
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:15,990
I came for a job, not to beg.
Thanks.

38
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:24,160
- Are you Miss Kanta?
- Yes.

39
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:26,600
- Please sit down.
- Thank you.

40
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,440
Listen!

41
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:40,820
I've gone through
what you've just done.

42
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,990
Somehow let the boss hear you sing.

43
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:48,130
- Owner?
- Yes. Babu Janaki Prasad. He employed me.

44
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,470
- Do you work here?
- Yes.

45
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:54,090
He's unwell these days,
and they are ruling.

46
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:01,410
Here's his address. And...

47
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,540
just be careful.
He's very short tempered.

48
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:07,560
- But he's very kindhearted. Go now.
- Thanks.

49
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:09,840
Listen.

50
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:14,180
If possible, take your sister along.

51
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:17,380
If he likes your singing,
your fortune will turn.

52
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:19,380
Very well. Thank you. Namaste.

53
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:31,050
Who?

54
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:46,970
- Babul? Why did you come here?
- Sister.

55
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:50,080
- I have great news.
- Uma, what was that noise?

56
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:53,000
- Nothing. A dog came in.
- What?

57
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,000
Quiet. Out! Out!

58
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:58,340
I've told you not to come here.

59
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:01,950
- Go. What if Babuji comes?
- Let him.

60
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,790
I've come to take you away.

61
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,690
- Take me away?
- Yes.

62
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,770
To meet the owner of the theater.

63
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:10,560
If he likes us,
we'll get the job at once.

64
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:12,820
And then, ah ha!

65
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:15,490
Stop blabbering.
A job in the theater?

66
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,340
Have you gone mad?

67
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:19,310
- Go away.
- Uma.

68
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:20,950
Who are you talking to?

69
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,650
No one. Go away. Quickly.

70
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,600
Uma. I heard voices.

71
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,840
- I'm sure someone was here.
- No. No one.

72
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:38,060
How can that be? You're lying.

73
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,120
Who was it? Speak.

74
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:43,050
I said there was no one.

75
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,840
Liar!

76
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:46,790
I'm sure it was your...!

77
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:50,270
Another word about my sister...

78
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,000
you'll regret it. Understand?

79
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:55,690
So you are the dog?

80
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,690
- Get out.
- Don't curse.

81
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,570
I've come to take my sister.

82
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,610
Have you gone mad?

83
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:03,190
I won't go.

84
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:04,810
Babuji, please forgive.

85
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:07,120
- He's young.
- That's enough.

86
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,700
Since your father died I've
looked after you for 2 years.

87
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:13,930
And your brother threatens me?

88
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:16,680
Even animals are grateful for favors.

89
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:18,490
- But you!
- What have you done?

90
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,750
She toils the whole day.

91
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,810
And gets a pittance.

92
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:25,130
- And they you say...
- Will you be quiet Babul?

93
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,530
Babuji, don't pay any attention to him.

94
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:32,450
- He's naive, and talks nonsense.
- He can do that at home.

95
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,300
Go!

96
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:35,960
You too.

97
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,660
- Babuji.
- No. I don't need you here.

98
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:40,640
Get lost.

99
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,560
What have you done, Babul?

100
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:47,160
Now what?

101
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:48,710
Don't worry.

102
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:50,650
We'll get a job at the theater.

103
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,080
You'll see.

104
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,860
Yes, jobs grow on trees.

105
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:56,770
Just reach out and pluck.

106
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:58,650
You'll starve.

107
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:00,330
But we won't come to you.

108
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:03,070
- Take your wage, sister.
- What wage?

109
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:05,430
- You won't get a cent.
- Is that so?

110
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:08,190
Not a cent?

111
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,880
Take out the money. Come on!

112
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:14,606
Police!

113
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:16,690
Out with her money. Be quick.

114
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:18,210
Hurry!

115
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:32,510
One more.

116
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:46,280
- Namaste.
- Wait you scoundrel.

117
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:49,970
Oh Ramu, Nathu run,
you good for nothing.

118
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:59,020
This is his house.
Wait, I'll go first.

119
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:04,050
I'm a bit scared.

120
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:05,780
It's of no use now.

121
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:08,220
- We have to do something now.
- Yes, sister.

122
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:14,440
No.

123
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,090
I've told you many times.

124
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,040
Earn if you want money.

125
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:21,700
- Don't bother me.
- But, brother. - Go away.

126
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:42,190
See, If I go away...

127
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:43,680
I won't return.

128
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,120
Remember.

129
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:46,950
Fine.

130
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,400
Good riddance.

131
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:49,890
Just think.

132
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,580
No one gives me a job.

133
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:53,580
- Is it my fault?
- No, mine.

134
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:56,490
Listen. Either look for a job...

135
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:58,830
or look after my theater.

136
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:01,680
Otherwise you're not welcome here.
Understand?

137
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,020
I've said this several times...

138
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:05,940
I don't like working in the theater.

139
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:07,580
Don't like working there...

140
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,000
but love to spend money
from the theater.

141
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:11,870
Lazy lout.

142
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:13,660
Out of my sight.

143
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,800
- You didn't understand, brother.
- That's all.

144
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,340
I won't hear another word.

145
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:18,866
Go away.

146
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:20,670
- You're always...
- Go, or else!

147
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:33,690
Let's go Babul.
We shouldn't go in here.

148
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:35,870
Look at his state.

149
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,640
Yes.

150
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:43,650
Listen.

151
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:49,170
- Excuse me. Who are you?
- She's my sister.

152
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:51,710
We wanted to work in the theater.

153
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:53,636
Then go, and meet him.

154
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:55,610
No, no.
Look what's become of you.

155
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,200
Wonder what'll become of us.

156
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,980
- Right, Babul?
- Yes, sister.

157
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:01,860
I see. Come with me, I'll take you.

158
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:04,670
Excuse us.
We don't want to end up like you.

159
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,540
No, no. He's very good with others.

160
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:10,850
He's just like a coconut.
Hard on the outside...

161
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:13,190
and soft on the inside.
See for yourself.

162
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:16,420
- Excuse us.
- Let's go, and see, sister.

163
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:18,610
Yes. You've nothing to lose.

164
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,190
Only to gain. And...

165
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:23,190
me too.

166
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:24,890
You too? How?

167
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:27,080
It's like this.

168
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,290
He'd like me to work in his theater.

169
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:31,540
But I don't.

170
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,530
Then why take us to him?

171
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:35,370
Because...

172
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,430
this way I do something for him.

173
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,760
And he'll be happy with me.

174
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:43,800
Oh, all this concern is for yourself?

175
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:46,300
- Let's go, Babul.
- You've got it wrong, Laxmi Devi.

176
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:48,540
I'm not Laxmi. My name's Uma.

177
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,290
Uma Devi. Help me please.

178
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,290
You'll gain too.

179
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,660
Come on sister. Let's see.

180
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,110
- But your brother?
- I told you...

181
00:11:58,390 --> 00:11:59,720
he's a coconut.

182
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:01,520
Like a coconut. Come.

183
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:19,070
What's with you?

184
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:20,930
Me? Nothing.

185
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,000
- Don't be afraid.
- We aren't. You are.

186
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:27,070
Me? Not at all.

187
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:28,830
Not at all.

188
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:31,130
Wait here.

189
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:40,450
- Brother.
- You're here again?

190
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:42,230
Don't shout. They're outside.

191
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:44,570
What're you saying? Who's outside?

192
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:46,920
Brother, I have a gift for you.

193
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:48,880
Just see them, once.

194
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:50,350
Then judge me.

195
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:52,350
Be more specific. What should I see?

196
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:54,350
- A pair of birds.
- Birds?!

197
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:56,580
I don't want any birds. Go away.

198
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:58,970
See them. Then decide.

199
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:08,960
- Here, take.
- These? - Yes.

200
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:11,100
They want a job in your theater.

201
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:13,200
They were flying away,
but I caught them.

202
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,680
What's your name?

203
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:23,790
Uma.

204
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:25,430
And yours?

205
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:26,860
Babul.

206
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,870
Where do you live?

207
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:31,290
At present we don't have any place.

208
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,020
Have you worked before?

209
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:36,720
Yes, at Babu Kundanlal's.

210
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:38,250
At Babu Kundanlal's?

211
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:40,790
- As what?
- I...

212
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,680
was a servant there.

213
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:45,580
Have you danced and sung before?

214
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:47,980
No, I haven't.

215
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,240
But she sings very well, brother.

216
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:52,930
Hear her. Your theater
will profit, believe me.

217
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,300
Have you heard her sing?

218
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:59,380
No, but they say so.

219
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:02,390
I knew it.

220
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:04,170
Take them away.

221
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,660
Hear them once.

222
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,300
I had to beg them to come.

223
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:09,870
Do as I say.

224
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,720
Don't make me angry.

225
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:13,350
Go.

226
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,050
Hard on the outside...

227
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:20,330
soft on the inside.

228
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:22,010
Like a coconut.

229
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:27,280
Come Babul.

230
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:33,670
Now I'm angry.

231
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:38,350
Listen.

232
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:42,046
Come with me.

233
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:43,970
Stand in front of the house and sing.

234
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:46,390
And loudly, to damage his eardrums.

235
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:48,976
Do you think we're beggars?

236
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:49,996
No.

237
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:52,200
He doesn't oblige
so he'll be forced to listen.

238
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:54,280
- That's it.
- The idea is good, sister.

239
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:57,010
Do what you want.
I'm going back to Babuji.

240
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,600
Your brother's more sensible than you.

241
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,010
- Come on. I might lose my temper.
- Leave me.

242
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,300
No. Come on.

243
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:18,310
You can have your lofty palaces

244
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:42,370
We love our lanes

245
00:15:54,930 --> 00:16:02,550
But even in your palaces
you don't find peace

246
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:12,860
Those sleeping in the lanes
on sheets of sorrow...

247
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,010
are the ones who enjoy
and revel in their dreams

248
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:47,440
You are bewitched with gold and silver

249
00:16:55,640 --> 00:17:00,850
Our heart is our wealth

250
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:08,500
You might consider our tears
as water from the eyes

251
00:17:18,349 --> 00:17:22,309
For us they are strings of pearls

252
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:43,170
Stop this. Stop.

253
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:45,200
Why should we? Carry on.

254
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:47,480
Aren't you ashamed?

255
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,120
There's a crowd here.

256
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:51,720
You don't value my respect?

257
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:53,820
You don't value mine either.

258
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:56,160
Whatever I do is of no value.

259
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:57,660
Yes, begin.

260
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:04,040
You are bewitched with gold and silver

261
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:17,080
Our heart is our wealth

262
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:25,240
You might consider our tears
as water from the eyes

263
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,660
For us they are strings of pearls

264
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:46,070
We love our lanes

265
00:18:58,550 --> 00:18:59,850
Stop it, Nirmal.

266
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:03,130
First tell me, can they come in?

267
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:04,810
Yes.

268
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:06,460
And sing for you?

269
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:07,620
Yes.

270
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:10,520
- Now stop this mockery.
- Come.

271
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,020
So, shall we begin?

272
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:30,470
- What?
- Won't you hear them sing?

273
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:32,670
No, no.

274
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,920
You create a problem everyday.

275
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,060
Not everyday.

276
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,800
- Only sometimes.
- Quiet! Stupid.

277
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:48,150
We love our lanes.

278
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:04,650
Meena, is your father there?

279
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,340
I want to talk to him.

280
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,020
Yes, it's me.

281
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:14,690
Listen. There's a girl and boy here.

282
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,340
They're good.

283
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:18,126
So you like them, brother?

284
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:19,476
Didn't I say so?

285
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,900
Now can I stay here?

286
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:23,160
Get lost. Idiot.

287
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,360
What did you say?

288
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,220
Not you.
I said that to Nirmal.

289
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:33,760
Listen. Come here
with Meena at once.

290
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:36,220
I want them on the stage today.

291
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:39,750
Yes, tonight. Just come.

292
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:45,180
You'll be on stage tonight.

293
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:49,000
- Both.
- Let go. Someone might see.

294
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,580
I'm sorry. Okay...

295
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,716
wait here.

296
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:59,136
Manager and Meena Devi are coming.

297
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,460
Bhaiya'll make it work.

298
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,300
Manager and Meena Devi?

299
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:04,720
- Coming here?
- Yes.

300
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,080
Brother's called them.

301
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:09,140
- Why? What happened?
- Nothing.

302
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,540
Nothing.

303
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:13,700
Who's Meena Devi?

304
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:15,120
A star in Bhaiya's theater.

305
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:16,810
She stays on the top floor.

306
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:18,950
I'll leave now.

307
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:20,480
Meet you at the theater.

308
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,120
Why are you leaving?

309
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:26,420
You don't know, she scares me.

310
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:29,140
I keep my distance.

311
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:30,340
Why?

312
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,580
- I'll tell you later.
- Nirmal Babu.

313
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:35,170
Stay here.
She might ask us to go.

314
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:37,400
Not in the presence of bhaiya.

315
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,940
So, see you at the theater.

316
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:45,000
Didi, sit here.

317
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:47,650
- I'll be back.
- No. I'll be all alone.

318
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:50,990
- I'll be back soon.
- No. Don't go.

319
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:53,340
It's like this.

320
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:56,740
(A sign of needing
to go to the bathroom.)

321
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:14,680
- Namaste, Nirmal babu.
- Oh, Dalip.

322
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:18,420
Either you never come here, or...

323
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:20,326
you creep in like a thief.

324
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:21,850
- Don't shout.
- What's the matter?

325
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:23,810
Listen. Where is she?

326
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:25,800
- Who? Meena Devi?
- No. No.

327
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:27,530
She shouldn't know I'm here.

328
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:30,240
- Is she anywhere near?
- Don't worry.

329
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:32,270
- She's in her room.
- Alright.

330
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:36,330
- Where's the new actress.
- Uma Devi?

331
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,636
The one...

332
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:39,440
- With a brother? Yes?
- Yes.

333
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,620
- I see! - What?
- Nothing.

334
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:44,490
She's in that room.

335
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:50,050
- Namaste Nirmal babu.
- Namaste.

336
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:36,540
- What happened?
- Nothing.

337
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,040
Please leave.

338
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:43,010
With such difficulty
I got you this job.

339
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:45,110
Now you treat me like this?

340
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,890
Don't get me wrong.

341
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:49,890
It wasn't an insult.

342
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:51,990
Were you joking?

343
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:55,230
I just want to check your costume.

344
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:57,720
No. I can't come out.

345
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,470
- Why?
- I'm unable to say.

346
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:03,700
- Just leave.
- What's the matter with you?

347
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:06,990
Don't come in.

348
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:09,770
- Go away.
- I'm sorry.

349
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:14,810
Hello. Nirmal?

350
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:23,320
- Why are you running away?
- Not at all...

351
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:26,430
I'm not. I came here by mistake.

352
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:28,530
Anyway, whether by mistake
or on purpose...

353
00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:30,660
- at least you came.
- Yes, yes.

354
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:34,090
- But I...
- I'm so happy to see you here.

355
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,730
Come let's chat.

356
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:37,780
No, I've a lot to do.

357
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,280
Work? You?

358
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:42,090
Good joke. Come, sit down.

359
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:44,526
- I won't let you go.
- Please understand. I...

360
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:47,040
- really have important work.
- Important?

361
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:48,550
What can it be?

362
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:53,310
- Oh. With that new girl?
- Yes.

363
00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:56,950
So that's why you came here?

364
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:04,680
Has he gone?

365
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,040
- Oh.
- Why? What happened?

366
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,860
Nothing. Go get dressed quickly.

367
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,310
Shameless.

368
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:11,320
Dearest, speak softly,
someone will hear you

369
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:34,040
Mother-in-law is sleeping inside
and sister-in-law, outside

370
00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:42,730
I feel shy,
please open the door softly

371
00:26:55,390 --> 00:26:59,160
No one's sleeping or awake.
Stop making excuses

372
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:07,950
Only we are aware of these late hours

373
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,180
Part your veil

374
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,440
Speak softly

375
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,670
Some one will see

376
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:37,900
You've got your salary today

377
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:40,580
You've bought neither
any sarees nor dupattas

378
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:51,810
- I've brought something special.
- What?

379
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:56,270
- 2 packets for 9 annas.
- What?

380
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:01,470
Of what?

381
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:03,690
Of Spring.

382
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:07,480
- Spring?
- Yes.

383
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:11,880
Seeing it, our hearts will beat

384
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:29,560
Speak softly.
Someone will hear you

385
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:53,810
Come here.
It's your turn now.

386
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:57,530
Don't get nervous.
Just stand there and start singing.

387
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,860
Yes, get out there

388
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:20,920
- Go on.
- I'm feeling nervous.

389
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:24,120
- Go sister.
- I knew she'd be a problem. - Shut up.

390
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:25,940
Go sister. Don't be afraid.

391
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:32,790
- Come on. Sing, sister.
- Shall I open the curtains?

392
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:35,430
- Start.
- She'll be our downfall.

393
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,620
Shut up.

394
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:39,390
- What's the matter?
- Please sing.

395
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:11,220
A small world

396
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:23,720
A small world in my little heart

397
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:36,890
Small houses, a small courtyard,
and a small garden

398
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:49,400
There's a small world
in my small heart

399
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:03,830
In this garden flowers of hope bloom

400
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:07,700
My dreams are swinging on...

401
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:13,270
a swing with ropes of dedication

402
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:43,570
Monsoons make me laugh, then cry

403
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:56,000
The koel is chirping and celebrating

404
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,750
It wakes me up

405
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:33,470
This small world with its small matters

406
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:41,000
Short days and short nights

407
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:49,440
And the age is small too

408
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:05,610
A small world in my little heart

409
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:09,590
Very good.

410
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:13,770
Listen. Get changed, and go home.

411
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:15,930
Certainly not.
Who are you to fire her?

412
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,520
Who me? I'll tell you. Go on.

413
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:22,510
Get changed. I'll be right back.

414
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:53,050
Yes, it's me. What happened?

415
00:33:56,550 --> 00:33:59,550
- What?
- Both were disgraceful.

416
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:02,750
They are useless. I'd warned you.

417
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:06,590
Now the people are jeering.

418
00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:10,090
They're jeering?
What are you saying?

419
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:15,380
No.
There's no need for me to come.

420
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:19,210
Do what you think is right. I mean...

421
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:23,110
if they're no good, fire them.

422
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:25,240
I've already done that.

423
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:28,030
You know I don't do things by half.

424
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,530
Give it to me. Hello. Bhaiya?

425
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:52,439
What's it? No, I can't keep them.

426
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:56,210
- Don't pester me.
- But it's very late.

427
00:34:56,650 --> 00:34:58,200
They have nowhere to go.

428
00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:00,520
It was her first time
and she was nervous.

429
00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:04,810
- This will be unkind.
- What can I do?

430
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:10,010
What? You're bringing them here?

431
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:13,820
Of course. Give them shelter.
Teach them.

432
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,370
You've made many stars.
Now it's their turn.

433
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:19,390
- I'm bringing them.
- You devil.

434
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:23,046
You won't listen. Everyday...

435
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:24,570
you create some problem for me.

436
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:28,430
- Idiot.
- Not everyday, brother. Only sometimes.

437
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:32,420
So? My word carries weight too.

438
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:43,480
Uma Devi? Babul?

439
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:49,400
- They've gone. - Where?
- How should I know?

440
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:52,370
Let them go.

441
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:04,020
Dalip, did you see Uma Devi
and Babul leave?

442
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:07,410
Yes, they went that way.
I tried to stop them, but they wouldn't.

443
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:18,940
- What now, didi?
- We'll carry on walking till morning.

444
00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:28,440
Babul, wait. Where're you going?

445
00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:31,290
Nowhere. We're just walking aimlessly.

446
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:34,540
That's crazy.
Bhaiya's asked both to come home.

447
00:36:36,290 --> 00:36:38,950
What's the use? We're useless.

448
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:41,350
You've done a lot for us.

449
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,880
We're grateful to you.

450
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:47,970
I beg you to come.
Don't ruin everything.

451
00:36:49,490 --> 00:36:53,580
Don't spoil the plan.
Come on Babul.

452
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:06,250
I gave you a chance,
but you failed.

453
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:07,690
I can't do more.

454
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:10,160
Give me another chance Janaki babu.

455
00:37:10,290 --> 00:37:12,920
Nirmal babu said I must try again...

456
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:14,460
till I succeed.

457
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:17,300
You can try all your life
but won't succeed.

458
00:37:17,590 --> 00:37:19,670
- Go away.
- Have mercy please.

459
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:22,260
We're homeless. Nowhere to go.

460
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,200
Go away.

461
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:28,840
Monsoons have come
to make one laugh...

462
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:31,250
and weep

463
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:36,080
Monsoon makes one laugh and cry

464
00:37:39,730 --> 00:37:43,380
The koel (cuckoo) is celebrating...

465
00:37:47,410 --> 00:37:49,560
morning through evening

466
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:58,130
Small world in my little heart

467
00:38:10,650 --> 00:38:14,260
Small things of a small world

468
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:21,390
Short days and short nights

469
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:27,640
And young age

470
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:42,010
A small world in my little heart

471
00:38:54,850 --> 00:38:57,000
- What is it, Uma Devi?
- Nothing.

472
00:38:57,430 --> 00:39:00,720
I can't sleep. ls Babul awake?

473
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,530
He's sleeping in that room.

474
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:05,660
- Why?
- I've been wanting to speak with him.

475
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:07,990
- I'm feeling disturbed.
- Oh.

476
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,450
Let Babul sleep.

477
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:13,850
We can talk on the verandah outside.

478
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,300
If you approve, of course.

479
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,840
Let it be. I'll go upstairs.

480
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:22,350
- I don't want to trouble you.
- No, no. Not at all.

481
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,670
Sit out there, and you'll feel better.

482
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:43,650
Such a pleasant night. No?

483
00:39:46,090 --> 00:39:49,320
Moonlight, shining stars!

484
00:39:50,050 --> 00:39:51,890
It all looks so beautiful.

485
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:56,720
- Why did you smile?
- Just like that.

486
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,350
No, please tell me.

487
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:03,080
- Do thousands of stars shine in moonlight?
- What?

488
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:05,810
You are right.

489
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:10,850
Lovely moonlight! Lovely pair!

490
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:13,920
Sweet talk. Oh ho.

491
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:17,550
- Great!
- What are you saying Meena?

492
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:20,610
- She was feeling restless, and...
- Yes.

493
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:23,320
I know. I understand.

494
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:28,440
Okay, I'll go now. Thank you.

495
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:37,020
Don't be deceived, babuji.

496
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:39,890
But if so, then remember...

497
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,780
there's water in the sea,
as well as stones.

498
00:41:12,910 --> 00:41:13,910
Wonderful!

499
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,680
What are you doing here?

500
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:36,920
Nothing.
You asked her to wait here.

501
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:39,880
I thought she's alone here, so...

502
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:45,930
Uma. I've brought
these clothes for you.

503
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,320
Don't wear such clothes.

504
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:51,510
You go out and meet people.

505
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:53,390
Wear good clothes.

506
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,480
Do you like them?

507
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:01,830
- Very much. Thank you.
- Okay.

508
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:04,230
Change your clothes and go to the theater.

509
00:42:04,570 --> 00:42:06,960
- You might be late for rehearsals.
- Alright.

510
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:10,300
Bhaiya. They don't rehearse properly
in the theater.

511
00:42:10,530 --> 00:42:11,930
She can rehearse at home.

512
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:13,830
- No, who'll teach her here?
- Why?

513
00:42:14,070 --> 00:42:15,620
You're here. You've taught so many.

514
00:42:16,070 --> 00:42:18,910
- No, I'm not well.
- I'll help you.

515
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:22,000
She's learned a lot already.
You can teach her the rest.

516
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:23,460
But how?

517
00:42:24,630 --> 00:42:26,500
I'll show you. Sit there and watch.

518
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:47,810
My heart, make a world of your own

519
00:42:57,240 --> 00:43:00,540
Far away where no one can reach

520
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:04,560
Where no one will sing sad songs

521
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:08,690
Let love quietly enter the eyes

522
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:47,430
Decorate the nights with dreams

523
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:02,800
Let magic play in every home...

524
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:11,160
where those who sulk can go

525
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,680
They will be helped to cheer up

526
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:56,780
My heart make a world of your own

527
00:45:01,510 --> 00:45:03,200
No, this won't work.

528
00:45:03,510 --> 00:45:06,740
Waste of time teaching songs.

529
00:45:07,650 --> 00:45:09,310
Why? Didn't you like it?

530
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:11,960
I don't have to give
a reason for everything.

531
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:14,010
Just do as I say.

532
00:45:17,670 --> 00:45:18,670
Your wish.

533
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:26,190
- Did something happen?
- No, no.

534
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:29,280
Sometimes even I don't understand
bhaiya's moods.

535
00:45:30,490 --> 00:45:32,680
Anyway. Please get dressed quickly.

536
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:46,660
- What are you doing here?
- Waiting for you.

537
00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:49,350
I've something to say to you.

538
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:52,830
- What?
- Why are you teasing me like this?

539
00:45:53,090 --> 00:45:54,640
Upsetting you? Means?

540
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:56,730
You know everything.

541
00:45:57,530 --> 00:45:59,900
Don't talk nonsense, Meena.

542
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:04,270
It wasn't nonsense ten years ago.

543
00:46:04,810 --> 00:46:08,060
Ten years ago you were
an innocent little girl.

544
00:46:08,470 --> 00:46:09,570
And now...

545
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:12,170
- I don't know what to say.
- Don't humiliate me so.

546
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:14,000
My heart's breaking.

547
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:16,460
You know how much I love you.

548
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:18,910
That's what the problem is.

549
00:46:20,590 --> 00:46:22,780
Why don't you just say
you love that girl.

550
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:25,600
What? What did you say?

551
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:30,240
You love her. That's why
you're doing so much for her.

552
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:32,290
You want to marry her.

553
00:46:32,650 --> 00:46:34,550
But I won't let it happen.

554
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:36,826
I'll kill myself. I'll take poison.

555
00:46:36,850 --> 00:46:39,140
Slow down, slow down.
Don't be in a hurry.

556
00:46:39,650 --> 00:46:41,010
I'm feeling dizzy.

557
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:42,910
Do what you like.

558
00:46:43,110 --> 00:46:44,700
But first let me go from here.

559
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:47,900
Don't go Nirmal.

560
00:46:58,470 --> 00:47:00,290
I know you very well.

561
00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:04,070
Get up. Or else here's your head...

562
00:47:04,350 --> 00:47:05,710
and here's a jug of cold water.

563
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:07,220
No, no.

564
00:47:08,490 --> 00:47:09,590
Well done.

565
00:47:10,150 --> 00:47:12,400
Okay, now go and get yourself
smelling salts.

566
00:47:12,870 --> 00:47:14,070
You'll be okay.

567
00:47:15,470 --> 00:47:16,470
Rascal.

568
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:21,570
- What happened.
- Meena is jealous.

569
00:47:21,850 --> 00:47:23,600
She says I love you.

570
00:47:23,860 --> 00:47:25,360
I want to marry you.

571
00:47:46,860 --> 00:47:48,440
I think she's right.

572
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:51,760
Come.

573
00:48:05,610 --> 00:48:07,010
What are you thinking?

574
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:10,790
- Why did you do this needlessly?
- What?

575
00:48:11,290 --> 00:48:13,390
Why'd you bring me here
instead of the theater?

576
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:16,160
What must I say?
The question is amazing.

577
00:48:16,410 --> 00:48:18,010
But are you happy to come here?

578
00:48:20,530 --> 00:48:22,650
I've never been so happy.

579
00:48:23,070 --> 00:48:25,600
Really? Why are you so happy?

580
00:48:26,790 --> 00:48:28,780
What must I say?
The question is amazing.

581
00:48:29,430 --> 00:48:31,520
Great!
Beating me with my own words.

582
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:39,450
- What will happen now?
- Why? What happened?

583
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:42,850
That you and I came here like this.

584
00:48:45,150 --> 00:48:46,590
I'm afraid.

585
00:48:47,410 --> 00:48:48,610
Why afraid?

586
00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:50,580
It'll work once I tell bhaiya.

587
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:53,510
- What will you say?
- That we...

588
00:48:53,870 --> 00:48:55,940
I mean, we want to get married.

589
00:49:01,860 --> 00:49:04,900
Uma. Just you and me.

590
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:07,630
No problems. No worries.

591
00:49:08,290 --> 00:49:09,590
You've suffered a lot.

592
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:13,040
Yes, now you don't have to work.

593
00:49:13,310 --> 00:49:15,560
- It's my responsibility, now.
- No, no.

594
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:17,670
I won't burden you.

595
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:19,980
Yes, it weighs you down.
Really Uma...

596
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:22,910
I'll be happy to carry this burden.

597
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:24,740
My heart knows.

598
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:26,970
- Honestly?
- As much...

599
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:28,860
as you're Uma.

600
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:31,460
And I... arre.

601
00:49:32,490 --> 00:49:34,190
- What happened?
- I've forgotten my name.

602
00:49:34,650 --> 00:49:37,580
Your name? What do I know?

603
00:49:42,150 --> 00:49:43,700
Caught you!

604
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:47,780
- What happened?
- A thorn, I think.

605
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:51,020
- Let me see.
- No. I'll remove it myself.

606
00:49:52,330 --> 00:49:54,440
You can't see the underside.
Let me.

607
00:49:54,940 --> 00:49:56,960
- No. Leave it.
- Why?

608
00:49:57,540 --> 00:49:59,640
Feeling shy. A thorn in your foot...

609
00:49:59,910 --> 00:50:01,700
shyness in your eyes.
'No' on your tongue...

610
00:50:01,970 --> 00:50:03,870
and 'yes' in your heart.
Come, let me.

611
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:11,140
Be quick.

612
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:15,230
It takes time to take out
such a big thorn.

613
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:17,210
Look.

614
00:50:19,050 --> 00:50:20,450
Go to your bush.

615
00:50:20,650 --> 00:50:22,710
Never again get entangled
in a beauty's foot.

616
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:26,260
Come. Oh, what are you doing?

617
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:28,340
Nothing. Come here.

618
00:50:29,030 --> 00:50:31,340
- Why?
- Come on.

619
00:50:31,750 --> 00:50:33,230
Let me touch your feet.

620
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:35,670
I don't have a thorn in my foot.

621
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:38,360
But my foot had.

622
00:50:38,950 --> 00:50:39,950
Come.

623
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:43,310
I can't walk.

624
00:50:49,860 --> 00:50:54,240
I can't walk my dear,
because of a thorn in my foot

625
00:51:13,540 --> 00:51:17,540
The thorn has become a friend
and has come to my street

626
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:25,090
One pierces the body...

627
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:30,410
the other mocks

628
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:53,180
She goes to pick flowers
but is afraid of the thorns

629
00:52:02,950 --> 00:52:07,090
How will the crazy one find happiness
when she's afraid of sorrow?

630
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:16,460
Come, beloved,
let's hold hands and walk together

631
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:26,660
There are thorns in every lane
which will turn to flower buds

632
00:52:31,270 --> 00:52:35,190
Never again say
that you can't tread on the path

633
00:52:51,270 --> 00:52:55,770
My dear I can't walk because of the thorn

634
00:53:02,390 --> 00:53:04,990
Where were you, didi? You didn't
go to the theater for rehearsals.

635
00:53:05,270 --> 00:53:08,440
I just went for a walk with Nirmal babu.

636
00:53:08,910 --> 00:53:12,260
Why did you do that?
Janaki babu's very angry.

637
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:14,340
He might do something.

638
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:17,470
Don't worry. I'll see to it. Come.

639
00:53:24,930 --> 00:53:26,330
Oh, you've come back?

640
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:28,716
I have to say something.

641
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:30,520
- I too have to tell you something.
- Quiet!

642
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:33,200
- No one asked you.
- But... - Be quiet.

643
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:35,460
Don't interfere in everything. Come.

644
00:53:43,010 --> 00:53:46,760
- Did you say anything to bhaiya?
- Who, I?

645
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:50,310
Why should I?
Doesn't he have eyes?

646
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:14,360
Uma, Uma Rani, Uma Devi,
Uma Kumari, etc.

647
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:29,370
Would you like to listen?
For entertainment?

648
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:30,960
No.

649
00:54:32,370 --> 00:54:33,910
Do you mind...

650
00:54:34,060 --> 00:54:35,950
if I sing?

651
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:37,600
No.

652
00:54:40,980 --> 00:54:44,890
What was my fault
that drove you away...

653
00:54:45,260 --> 00:54:48,920
my dear heart?
The light of my eyes

654
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:19,800
You spread the essence
of your love in my street

655
00:55:30,070 --> 00:55:33,670
You made my heart beat

656
00:55:38,420 --> 00:55:43,990
What punishment is this?
Why this distance, my dear?

657
00:56:03,630 --> 00:56:07,050
The others drank and started staggering

658
00:56:23,430 --> 00:56:27,010
I too drank, but was not filled
with any sublime emotion

659
00:56:31,290 --> 00:56:34,840
Serve me in a way
that I go on drinking

660
00:56:46,770 --> 00:56:50,560
That I can live and get completely drunk

661
00:56:54,630 --> 00:56:58,350
What did I do to drive you away...

662
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:02,200
my dear heart?
The light of my eyes

663
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:03,930
What is my fault?

664
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:13,800
- Liked it?
- Yes, very much.

665
00:57:14,250 --> 00:57:16,860
- Happy?
- Yes, very much.

666
00:57:22,730 --> 00:57:24,790
- What happened?
- Nothing. All is well.

667
00:57:25,230 --> 00:57:27,230
I've apologized to Janaki babu.

668
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:30,990
And promised to rehearse everyday.

669
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:34,090
And to work hard. This is right.

670
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:36,580
- Did you tell him about us?
- No.

671
00:57:36,860 --> 00:57:38,570
- I'll tell him.
- No, not now.

672
00:57:39,060 --> 00:57:41,270
- Why not?
- He's in a bad mood right now.

673
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:43,470
He might turn us out.

674
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:45,630
So what? I'll find another place.

675
00:57:45,780 --> 00:57:47,180
I'm not alone.

676
00:57:47,490 --> 00:57:48,860
I have Babul.

677
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:51,430
And if you don't find a place, then?

678
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:53,850
- Don't worry about that.
- No, no.

679
00:57:54,030 --> 00:57:56,720
- I won't let you do that for me.
- Why not?

680
00:57:57,980 --> 00:57:59,980
You're not yet acquainted with trouble.

681
00:58:00,420 --> 00:58:02,280
You don't know about
wandering helplessly.

682
00:58:02,690 --> 00:58:04,530
What hunger and thirst is.

683
00:58:05,170 --> 00:58:09,090
- I'm used to it.
- Alright. Whatever you say.

684
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:17,140
Don't worry. I didn't hear anything.

685
00:58:18,110 --> 00:58:19,970
See, I've my fingers in my ears.

686
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:42,050
- Are you angry?
- No.

687
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:46,250
I didn't want to hurt you.

688
00:58:49,190 --> 00:58:50,540
Look at me.

689
00:58:51,990 --> 00:58:53,340
Look at me.

690
00:58:55,890 --> 00:58:57,560
When I first came here...

691
00:58:57,880 --> 00:58:59,930
it was never my aim to work.

692
00:59:00,540 --> 00:59:03,160
You know you insisted.

693
00:59:03,690 --> 00:59:05,980
You wanted me to become a big star.

694
00:59:06,410 --> 00:59:07,510
I know.

695
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:10,460
So why give people a chance to mock?

696
00:59:10,860 --> 00:59:13,410
Manager and Meena
are waiting for this moment.

697
00:59:13,820 --> 00:59:15,380
You want to give it to them?

698
00:59:15,670 --> 00:59:17,710
- No.
- Then don't stop me.

699
00:59:18,030 --> 00:59:20,980
We should finish what we started.

700
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:22,950
Both of us should.

701
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:25,090
That's fine.

702
00:59:25,170 --> 00:59:28,340
But I fear it will
interfere with our lives.

703
00:59:29,190 --> 00:59:31,390
Never. I'll leave it whenever you say.

704
00:59:31,720 --> 00:59:33,050
But not right now.

705
00:59:34,890 --> 00:59:37,200
Once you're in it, you can't come out.

706
00:59:38,010 --> 00:59:40,550
Why not?
I'll quit tomorrow if you get a job.

707
00:59:40,930 --> 00:59:44,770
Promise. Till then we have to be patient.

708
00:59:48,020 --> 00:59:49,770
But my heart doesn't agree.

709
00:59:50,950 --> 00:59:53,030
This job isn't for you.

710
00:59:56,190 --> 00:59:57,760
Earlier you didn't think so.

711
00:59:58,900 --> 01:00:00,870
Then you were looking for a job.

712
01:00:01,230 --> 01:00:03,330
I wanted to help you.

713
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:06,960
Things have changed now.
I feel bad that...

714
01:00:07,710 --> 01:00:09,140
my wife has to...

715
01:00:09,220 --> 01:00:11,000
work in the theater or anywhere else.

716
01:00:11,370 --> 01:00:13,610
It's only a matter of time.

717
01:00:13,890 --> 01:00:16,110
You'll certainly find a job somewhere.

718
01:00:17,830 --> 01:00:21,410
- Alright.
- I knew you'd understand.

719
01:00:22,070 --> 01:00:24,410
But now you too have to do something.

720
01:00:24,950 --> 01:00:27,800
I'll work. You'll look for work.

721
01:00:28,350 --> 01:00:29,790
- Okay?
- Alright.

722
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:44,790
My lady, is your raja willing
to let you become a star?

723
01:00:47,080 --> 01:00:50,370
- Sure.
- How many days will it take?

724
01:00:50,990 --> 01:00:52,520
- Tell me.
- Who knows?

725
01:00:53,170 --> 01:00:55,640
But to shut your mouth,
I'll have to become one.

726
01:01:28,190 --> 01:01:31,100
Do something father.
If Uma succeeds today...

727
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:34,440
- no one will want me again.
- What can I do?

728
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:38,360
- I can't change anything.
- Nothing at all?

729
01:01:38,580 --> 01:01:40,090
Or you don't want to?

730
01:01:40,420 --> 01:01:41,620
What? No.

731
01:01:41,850 --> 01:01:43,530
I'd do my best for you.

732
01:01:44,430 --> 01:01:47,060
Janaki babu controls everything now.

733
01:01:47,850 --> 01:01:49,190
Don't know why?

734
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:52,730
It's not even a month...

735
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:55,800
and today she's on stage. Shameless.

736
01:01:56,340 --> 01:01:58,790
She'll ruin my life's efforts.

737
01:01:59,420 --> 01:02:02,530
Don't just sit father. Do something.

738
01:02:02,930 --> 01:02:06,830
What? Give me a plan.
I can't think of any.

739
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:09,250
There must be a way.

740
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:15,640
Yes!

741
01:02:24,660 --> 01:02:27,820
- Dalip, will you do something for me?
- What?

742
01:02:29,370 --> 01:02:32,460
If you don't I'll be ruined, Dalip.

743
01:02:32,790 --> 01:02:34,310
What can it be?

744
01:02:34,590 --> 01:02:36,800
If Uma succeeds today...

745
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:38,200
I'll be ruined.

746
01:02:38,700 --> 01:02:40,690
Can you see that?

747
01:02:41,390 --> 01:02:43,800
I helped you to find your feet here.

748
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:45,740
Help me today.

749
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:49,160
- But to help you...
- I'll give you anything.

750
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:53,250
- 200, 500.
- What must I do?

751
01:02:54,590 --> 01:02:56,880
Get some men.

752
01:02:57,140 --> 01:02:59,120
Give them tickets, and money.

753
01:02:59,580 --> 01:03:01,210
When Uma finishes...

754
01:03:01,330 --> 01:03:02,740
they must jeer...

755
01:03:03,390 --> 01:03:05,640
and throw rotten eggs,
tomatoes, shoes...

756
01:03:05,890 --> 01:03:08,840
- onto the stage. Okay?
- Yes.

757
01:03:10,260 --> 01:03:12,830
Rotten eggs, tomatoes...

758
01:03:13,940 --> 01:03:16,130
shoes. That's all?

759
01:03:16,420 --> 01:03:18,370
Yes. Will you do it?

760
01:03:18,840 --> 01:03:21,040
If you say so. But...

761
01:03:21,870 --> 01:03:24,370
- Yes?
- You are clever...

762
01:03:24,680 --> 01:03:27,120
- to come to me.
- Ain't I? Here, take.

763
01:03:27,660 --> 01:03:30,880
I have only Rs50 here.
I'll give you the rest later.

764
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:33,780
Now I feel relief.

765
01:03:34,700 --> 01:03:37,670
Just wait and see our work.

766
01:03:37,910 --> 01:03:39,310
Then feel the relief.

767
01:03:39,870 --> 01:03:43,040
It'll be special. Don't worry.

768
01:05:17,420 --> 01:05:24,460
Spring has arrived friend, and longing
has ended. The woods are blooming

769
01:05:44,380 --> 01:05:47,720
The buds have silently
lifted their veils...

770
01:05:51,460 --> 01:05:54,890
and wish to hear
the humming of the bees

771
01:06:45,670 --> 01:06:48,920
The heart's desire reflects
the color of the mustard flowers

772
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:56,320
Eyes enjoy playing Holi...

773
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:03,430
with their pink color of intoxication

774
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:22,580
Lovers are dancing
in the groves among trees

775
01:07:32,040 --> 01:07:34,700
With their arms around each other...

776
01:07:39,370 --> 01:07:43,010
celebrating the moment of being together

777
01:07:54,090 --> 01:07:57,690
The spring has arrived, friends,
and longing has ended

778
01:07:57,720 --> 01:08:01,200
The woods are blooming

779
01:09:08,580 --> 01:09:11,250
Uma? Are you crying?

780
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:14,530
- What happened?
- Nothing Janaki babu.

781
01:09:16,220 --> 01:09:17,560
I'm very happy.

782
01:09:18,939 --> 01:09:20,599
I'm grateful to you.

783
01:09:21,490 --> 01:09:24,120
My happiness is immeasurable.

784
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:27,510
This's nothing.
You have to achieve much more.

785
01:09:28,240 --> 01:09:29,740
I expect a lot from you.

786
01:09:30,090 --> 01:09:32,390
- And you're crying?
- I'm not crying.

787
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:35,410
- I'm very happy.
- Alright. Sit down.

788
01:09:37,859 --> 01:09:41,239
- Wipe away your tears.
- Didi!

789
01:09:42,270 --> 01:09:45,310
Here you are.
Oh didi, I can't tell you...

790
01:09:45,609 --> 01:09:49,179
- What to say...
- No bhaiya.

791
01:09:49,540 --> 01:09:53,180
- You brought me here.
- No, it's due to your hard work, didi.

792
01:09:53,649 --> 01:09:56,800
- Oh, I'm so happy today.
- Okay Babul. Now please leave.

793
01:09:57,020 --> 01:09:59,100
- Let her rest a while.
- Yes. Okay.

794
01:09:59,410 --> 01:10:01,930
- If you need me, call me.
- Yes.

795
01:10:05,660 --> 01:10:09,250
No one can go in. Babuji's orders.

796
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:23,440
You are successful.
Your life is now for others.

797
01:10:24,430 --> 01:10:25,630
For those...

798
01:10:25,900 --> 01:10:29,170
who come here to see
and applaud your work.

799
01:10:29,950 --> 01:10:31,250
You're theirs now.

800
01:10:33,080 --> 01:10:36,680
Uma, I've brought something for you.
Look.

801
01:10:39,240 --> 01:10:42,610
- There was no need.
- I understand its need.

802
01:10:47,470 --> 01:10:49,760
Uma, you look very pretty.

803
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:54,870
Take it. I wish I...

804
01:10:58,040 --> 01:11:01,750
- What Janaki babu?
- Nothing. Just like that.

805
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:05,370
Please tell me. Please.

806
01:11:07,250 --> 01:11:09,340
I wanted to say that...

807
01:11:10,310 --> 01:11:11,800
Forget it. Let it be.

808
01:11:12,870 --> 01:11:15,480
What is it, Janaki babu. Say it.

809
01:11:16,490 --> 01:11:19,610
If you insist.
But don't get me wrong.

810
01:11:20,550 --> 01:11:22,010
Today I thought...

811
01:11:22,470 --> 01:11:24,400
if you had come some years earlier...

812
01:11:24,910 --> 01:11:26,260
I'd have married you.

813
01:11:31,550 --> 01:11:34,930
- You didn't mind that?
- No.

814
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:39,170
Janaki babu, can you take me home?

815
01:11:39,770 --> 01:11:42,980
- I'm very tired.
- Sure. Come.

816
01:11:50,310 --> 01:11:51,910
Oh, where were you?

817
01:11:52,440 --> 01:11:55,390
I've been waiting so long
to congratulate you.

818
01:11:55,680 --> 01:11:58,320
- Thank you.
- She was great today, wasn't she?

819
01:11:58,670 --> 01:11:59,870
No words.

820
01:12:00,460 --> 01:12:02,820
Oh, how beautiful.

821
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:04,760
Must be from babuji.

822
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:07,430
First success is always marked
by a gift from babuji.

823
01:12:08,660 --> 01:12:11,200
He gave me this. Do you remember?

824
01:12:11,700 --> 01:12:14,180
Yes. Uma, go and change.
Let's go home.

825
01:12:37,770 --> 01:12:39,510
Nirmal, I have news.

826
01:12:39,710 --> 01:12:41,090
You'll get a shock.

827
01:12:41,390 --> 01:12:44,420
I heard it and ran to save you.

828
01:12:44,830 --> 01:12:47,350
- Save me?
- Yes, you. - Yes.

829
01:12:47,940 --> 01:12:49,340
What's your spin now?

830
01:12:49,630 --> 01:12:51,410
- Tell.
- No, no spinning.

831
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:53,380
I have news of your diamond.

832
01:12:53,740 --> 01:12:56,210
- About Uma.
- Uma? What happened to her?

833
01:12:56,950 --> 01:13:00,040
Why're you so afraid?
Nothing's the matter with her.

834
01:13:00,590 --> 01:13:02,440
The matter is with you, mister.

835
01:13:02,890 --> 01:13:05,630
Your Uma is double crossing you.

836
01:13:07,990 --> 01:13:10,320
Meena, don't speak in riddles.
State facts.

837
01:13:11,970 --> 01:13:13,170
Okay, listen.

838
01:13:13,410 --> 01:13:16,370
Uma gained success today in work,
and other things.

839
01:13:16,850 --> 01:13:19,980
- She's getting married to Janaki babu.
- What?

840
01:13:20,650 --> 01:13:23,500
Yes. I heard it with my own ears.

841
01:13:23,880 --> 01:13:25,210
Janaki babu said...

842
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:27,500
'If it were possible,
I'd have married you.'

843
01:13:27,900 --> 01:13:30,170
'You don't mind my saying that, Uma?'

844
01:13:30,570 --> 01:13:32,790
She answered quickly, 'Not at all.'

845
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:35,750
When they came out
they were very happy.

846
01:13:36,130 --> 01:13:37,990
She was so proud she snubbed me.

847
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:40,730
Anyway, it's not about me.

848
01:13:41,060 --> 01:13:42,580
She doesn't care about you either.

849
01:13:43,250 --> 01:13:46,040
Janaki babu has money,
so she chose him.

850
01:13:46,510 --> 01:13:48,770
If you had, she'd be yours.

851
01:13:50,970 --> 01:13:52,670
Is that all, or there's more?

852
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:56,190
You don't believe me?
Go and ask her.

853
01:13:56,680 --> 01:13:59,540
No need. I believe you. Now go.

854
01:14:00,330 --> 01:14:03,480
Aren't you happy you found
out the truth so soon?

855
01:14:04,030 --> 01:14:06,340
She's not worth the dust of your shoes.

856
01:14:06,680 --> 01:14:08,230
- Meena go away.
- Nirmal...

857
01:14:08,490 --> 01:14:11,920
you know how much I love you.
I knew you were mine.

858
01:14:12,320 --> 01:14:13,920
And you will belong to me.

859
01:14:14,240 --> 01:14:16,320
Oh, Nirmal. Our lives.

860
01:14:16,820 --> 01:14:18,930
Why are you pushing me out? Nirmal.

861
01:14:34,150 --> 01:14:36,370
I said a lot of things in the theater.

862
01:14:36,830 --> 01:14:38,760
- Are you annoyed?
- No.

863
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:42,410
Don't mind whatever I say.
I'm getting old.

864
01:14:42,950 --> 01:14:45,590
Sometimes I say things I shouldn't.

865
01:14:46,260 --> 01:14:47,360
Forgive me.

866
01:15:18,150 --> 01:15:21,930
- How was the day? Did you get a job?
- No.

867
01:15:23,020 --> 01:15:26,550
Why didn't you come to the theater?
I was looking out for you.

868
01:15:27,180 --> 01:15:28,490
I didn't feel like it.

869
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:31,310
Would you like to hear
what happened there?

870
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:33,700
I know. You were very successful.

871
01:15:34,350 --> 01:15:37,410
- How did you find out?
- It was my belief.

872
01:15:38,050 --> 01:15:40,000
- I also heard about it.
- From whom?

873
01:15:41,410 --> 01:15:42,510
Everyone.

874
01:15:42,910 --> 01:15:45,890
- Such news spreads like fire.
- What's the matter?

875
01:15:46,490 --> 01:15:47,930
Have I done something wrong?

876
01:15:48,470 --> 01:15:50,320
No. What wrong?

877
01:15:51,420 --> 01:15:53,720
Only that sometimes I feel...

878
01:15:54,280 --> 01:15:57,400
we are like two trains which
met at a small station...

879
01:15:58,160 --> 01:16:01,140
- then left for our destinations.
- Why are you talking like this?

880
01:16:02,200 --> 01:16:04,920
- I'm feeling afraid.
- Why?

881
01:16:05,470 --> 01:16:07,140
If it really happens, then?

882
01:16:07,680 --> 01:16:09,280
So why are you already worried?

883
01:16:09,700 --> 01:16:11,610
Today you should be happy in every way.

884
01:16:12,220 --> 01:16:14,720
Yes, I should. But...

885
01:16:15,320 --> 01:16:17,160
I don't know what to say.

886
01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:34,410
I can't say more.

887
01:16:45,430 --> 01:16:46,930
Do you understand its meaning?

888
01:16:47,700 --> 01:16:50,610
- You really want me to keep it?
- Yes.

889
01:16:51,370 --> 01:16:53,820
- That's why I put it on you.
- Then come.

890
01:16:57,560 --> 01:17:00,050
- Bhaiya, bhaiya.
- Yes.

891
01:17:02,410 --> 01:17:04,730
- What is it?
- Bhaiya, we're getting married.

892
01:17:06,890 --> 01:17:08,090
- Married?
- Yes.

893
01:17:09,680 --> 01:17:11,620
- To Uma?
- Yes.

894
01:17:12,760 --> 01:17:14,850
Why're you quiet, bhaiya?
Say something.

895
01:17:16,910 --> 01:17:19,600
What's there to say?
Yes, get married.

896
01:17:21,030 --> 01:17:22,620
- It's good news.
- Really?

897
01:17:30,580 --> 01:17:31,580
Come.

898
01:18:02,430 --> 01:18:05,000
What cruelty! It's your wedding night...

899
01:18:05,550 --> 01:18:08,040
bridegroom is alone,
and the bride's missing.

900
01:18:09,300 --> 01:18:11,540
- What are you doing here?
- Nothing.

901
01:18:11,880 --> 01:18:14,070
I came to congratulate both of you.

902
01:18:14,630 --> 01:18:15,930
But I see...

903
01:18:16,070 --> 01:18:18,280
only the bridegroom's here.

904
01:18:18,670 --> 01:18:22,080
Perhaps the bride
hasn't returned from the theater.

905
01:18:22,500 --> 01:18:24,700
- Really?
- Yes.

906
01:18:25,690 --> 01:18:27,750
You have my sympathy.

907
01:18:28,820 --> 01:18:31,730
I don't need your sympathy.
Get out of here.

908
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:34,790
Of course. I came to go away.

909
01:18:35,070 --> 01:18:36,470
I'm not settling here.

910
01:18:36,760 --> 01:18:38,850
But I must say something.

911
01:18:39,250 --> 01:18:40,700
If I were the bride...

912
01:18:41,070 --> 01:18:44,060
I wouldn't have left my bridegroom
alone like this.

913
01:18:44,570 --> 01:18:46,630
No matter what came.

914
01:18:48,100 --> 01:18:50,770
Meena, stop spouting poison and go away.

915
01:18:51,520 --> 01:18:52,820
This is nothing.

916
01:18:53,590 --> 01:18:55,970
It's the beginning of love.

917
01:18:56,440 --> 01:18:59,200
Wait and watch what lies ahead.

918
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:02,650
- Shut up!
- Get angry as much as you want...

919
01:19:03,180 --> 01:19:04,580
but you can't deny the truth.

920
01:19:04,710 --> 01:19:06,560
You don't know who Uma is.

921
01:19:06,770 --> 01:19:08,750
Where she's from.
Who her parents are.

922
01:19:09,390 --> 01:19:11,970
I did my best, but no one listens.

923
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:14,990
You didn't think it was important.

924
01:19:16,060 --> 01:19:17,400
Just dying for her.

925
01:19:17,850 --> 01:19:19,400
She doesn't even care for you.

926
01:19:19,680 --> 01:19:23,330
If she did, she wouldn't go to
the theater to get applause.

927
01:19:23,950 --> 01:19:25,980
Can anyone get along
with such a woman?

928
01:19:26,590 --> 01:19:29,160
This woman will ruin your home...

929
01:19:29,510 --> 01:19:33,200
your peace of mind, destroy
everything, and sully your name.

930
01:19:36,850 --> 01:19:38,480
What are you doing, Uma?

931
01:19:38,600 --> 01:19:40,270
Because of what she said.

932
01:19:40,430 --> 01:19:41,730
Why did she?

933
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:43,810
Anyway, let it be. Come, sit.

934
01:19:50,910 --> 01:19:52,740
- What's the matter Meena Devi?
- Nothing.

935
01:19:53,500 --> 01:19:55,580
You're rubbing your cheeks.
Did you get hurt?

936
01:19:57,360 --> 01:19:59,820
- What's it to you?
- Nothing, nothing.

937
01:20:00,220 --> 01:20:03,280
But you must have enjoyed it, yes?

938
01:20:04,190 --> 01:20:06,720
- Go away.
- Good.

939
01:20:11,800 --> 01:20:14,030
- What happened?
- Nothing.

940
01:20:14,510 --> 01:20:16,930
Don't know why Meena Devi
got angry with her picture.

941
01:20:17,450 --> 01:20:18,800
And then broke it.

942
01:20:19,980 --> 01:20:21,080
Strange.

943
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:27,200
- We'll be leaving home tomorrow.
- Leaving?

944
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:30,490
- Why?
- Because Uma's unhappy here.

945
01:20:31,450 --> 01:20:34,200
- Unhappy? Why?
- There are many reasons.

946
01:20:34,870 --> 01:20:36,980
Why're you talking nonsense?
Where's Uma?

947
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:38,980
No use speaking to her.

948
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:41,780
And I won't let her work in your theater.

949
01:20:42,100 --> 01:20:43,420
Oh, I see.

950
01:20:44,370 --> 01:20:46,960
What changed your mind suddenly?

951
01:20:47,310 --> 01:20:49,230
I don't have to answer your questions.

952
01:20:49,560 --> 01:20:51,940
Uma's my wife,
and I don't want her to work.

953
01:20:52,220 --> 01:20:54,980
- That's it.
- What will you live on?

954
01:20:55,480 --> 01:20:57,100
At least tell me that.

955
01:20:57,500 --> 01:20:59,390
I expect to get a job soon.

956
01:20:59,740 --> 01:21:02,510
So wait till you get it.

957
01:21:03,310 --> 01:21:05,960
I too want to rejoice that
you finally did something.

958
01:21:06,890 --> 01:21:09,590
- Till then I won't let Uma go anywhere.
- Why not?

959
01:21:11,160 --> 01:21:14,380
You want to argue with me?
You've been a wastrel all your life.

960
01:21:14,760 --> 01:21:16,090
Wasted so much money!

961
01:21:16,470 --> 01:21:18,520
And now you want to ruin a girl's life?

962
01:21:19,080 --> 01:21:21,500
- Why should it bother you?
- Why?

963
01:21:22,100 --> 01:21:25,250
I've spoiled you by
giving in to all your wishes.

964
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:28,280
I feel guilty and want to
set things right. Okay?

965
01:21:29,360 --> 01:21:31,800
- What if she too wants to leave?
- No.

966
01:21:32,230 --> 01:21:34,200
She's not a fool like you.

967
01:21:35,130 --> 01:21:38,320
But if she does,
I'll object. Is it a joke?

968
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:40,410
Come and go as you please.

969
01:21:40,780 --> 01:21:42,440
- You won't let her go?
- Never.

970
01:21:42,820 --> 01:21:45,100
Not until you're responsible enough
to run your home.

971
01:21:45,440 --> 01:21:47,340
Come back when you're capable of this.

972
01:21:47,620 --> 01:21:52,060
- Alright. But if anything happens to Uma, you'll be responsible.
- Yes.

973
01:21:52,290 --> 01:21:55,350
Don't teach me my responsibilities. Stupid.

974
01:22:22,050 --> 01:22:24,660
- What happened?
- Uma's unconscious. - Unconscious?

975
01:22:25,020 --> 01:22:26,710
The Doctor's with her. Don't go in.

976
01:22:27,750 --> 01:22:31,670
- But why did this happen?
- Don't worry. There's no danger.

977
01:22:38,630 --> 01:22:40,720
You'll kill her. You.

978
01:22:41,540 --> 01:22:43,590
- Are you in your senses?
- No, you are.

979
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:45,400
You're taking her life.

980
01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:47,490
- Shut up.
- I won't.

981
01:22:47,770 --> 01:22:50,030
I know you wanted to marry her.

982
01:22:50,250 --> 01:22:52,110
And when you couldn't,
you wanted revenge.

983
01:22:52,350 --> 01:22:54,160
- From both of us.
- Nirmal!

984
01:22:55,110 --> 01:22:57,450
Nirmal babu, don't talk nonsense.

985
01:22:57,610 --> 01:23:00,580
- Uma will be alright.
- Once she's well...

986
01:23:01,040 --> 01:23:03,000
it's goodbye to you and your work.

987
01:23:03,200 --> 01:23:05,720
- You've done all you wanted.
- Okay. Okay.

988
01:23:10,510 --> 01:23:11,610
How's she?

989
01:23:11,810 --> 01:23:13,860
- How long has she been working?
- Six months.

990
01:23:14,210 --> 01:23:15,310
Six months?!

991
01:23:15,650 --> 01:23:18,390
- She mustn't work now.
- Why? Any danger?

992
01:23:18,790 --> 01:23:20,840
She's going to have a baby.

993
01:23:21,230 --> 01:23:23,660
Baby? Then what're you doing
standing here?

994
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:25,500
Go and do something quickly.

995
01:23:25,710 --> 01:23:27,980
Don't worry. There's time.

996
01:23:29,970 --> 01:23:33,090
- May I go in?
- Yes.

997
01:23:33,480 --> 01:23:35,960
- But don't bother her with anything.
- Alright.

998
01:23:36,420 --> 01:23:38,280
- Go quietly.

999
01:24:20,900 --> 01:24:22,300
How're you feeling?

1000
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:28,700
You know what I'm going to do?
I'll take you away from here.

1001
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:30,690
And look after you myself.

1002
01:24:31,880 --> 01:24:35,070
Really? I'll be very happy.

1003
01:24:36,410 --> 01:24:39,230
- I've become exhausted.
- My Uma.

1004
01:24:40,380 --> 01:24:42,080
I'll not let you work here.

1005
01:24:42,700 --> 01:24:45,280
I'll arrange for a house and take you away at once.
- Nirmal.

1006
01:24:47,190 --> 01:24:49,290
Take her in this condition?
Can't you see?

1007
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:52,570
- I do. I also see my responsibilities.
- Don't be silly.

1008
01:24:53,110 --> 01:24:54,310
Use your brains.

1009
01:24:54,510 --> 01:24:58,360
I'll never forget your kindness...

1010
01:24:59,090 --> 01:25:02,200
but I can see I can't work anymore.

1011
01:25:03,160 --> 01:25:04,660
I'm very tired.

1012
01:25:05,860 --> 01:25:06,860
Yes.

1013
01:25:07,630 --> 01:25:10,230
But it doesn't mean you have to leave.

1014
01:25:11,720 --> 01:25:14,400
At least not in your present state.

1015
01:25:14,650 --> 01:25:15,750
Thank you.

1016
01:25:15,800 --> 01:25:18,700
But I won't leave her here
any longer. No matter what.

1017
01:25:21,620 --> 01:25:25,260
If you too want to go,
then I can't do anything.

1018
01:25:27,120 --> 01:25:30,160
The house is yours. Come back
whenever you feel like.

1019
01:25:40,120 --> 01:25:42,050
Didi, you'll take me too, no?

1020
01:25:42,470 --> 01:25:45,420
I'll work here, and live with you.

1021
01:25:46,750 --> 01:25:48,810
Of course. Yes?

1022
01:26:08,990 --> 01:26:11,260
Uma come quickly.
She won't stop crying.

1023
01:26:13,650 --> 01:26:15,460
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

1024
01:26:15,690 --> 01:26:17,380
- She's hungry.
- Give it to me.

1025
01:26:18,610 --> 01:26:21,000
- Only this much milk?
- Yes.

1026
01:26:37,740 --> 01:26:40,050
You were to meet somebody
for a job today.

1027
01:26:40,680 --> 01:26:43,330
Aren't you going? You might get it.

1028
01:26:43,700 --> 01:26:45,240
Yes, I'm going.

1029
01:26:45,570 --> 01:26:48,250
But don't be late for dinner.

1030
01:26:48,640 --> 01:26:49,640
I won't.

1031
01:26:56,340 --> 01:26:59,370
Didi, how long can this go on?
Janaki babu was asking...

1032
01:26:59,570 --> 01:27:01,010
why Uma doesn't stay here...

1033
01:27:01,240 --> 01:27:03,120
until Nirmal gets a job?

1034
01:27:03,610 --> 01:27:04,810
No, Babul.

1035
01:27:04,840 --> 01:27:07,640
I left. I don't want to go back
to be a burden again.

1036
01:27:08,090 --> 01:27:09,530
And Nirmal won't like it.

1037
01:27:10,170 --> 01:27:11,770
Why don't you work?

1038
01:27:12,100 --> 01:27:14,620
- You used to.
- It's not possible anymore.

1039
01:27:15,290 --> 01:27:18,330
It isn't for your sake,
but for the baby's.

1040
01:27:18,680 --> 01:27:21,100
How will you feed her
after some days?

1041
01:27:21,880 --> 01:27:23,950
Let's see. God will help.

1042
01:27:25,800 --> 01:27:27,100
Answer the door.

1043
01:27:30,020 --> 01:27:31,510
Oh you. Come in.

1044
01:27:31,940 --> 01:27:34,310
- Where's Nirmal?
- He's gone out.

1045
01:27:34,980 --> 01:27:36,550
Who is it, Babul?

1046
01:27:37,520 --> 01:27:40,170
- He's come for the rent.
- Namaste, Uma Devi.

1047
01:27:42,830 --> 01:27:44,660
The owner is adamant.

1048
01:27:45,040 --> 01:27:47,690
He wants the 10 month's rent.
He's very angry.

1049
01:27:47,960 --> 01:27:50,900
If you don't pay today,
he'll ask you to leave.

1050
01:27:51,390 --> 01:27:53,750
I did my best, but...

1051
01:27:53,970 --> 01:27:55,270
How much is it?

1052
01:27:55,310 --> 01:27:58,020
- Rs160.
- Rs 160?

1053
01:28:00,300 --> 01:28:03,040
Come back later, I'll give it.

1054
01:28:03,140 --> 01:28:05,340
Oh, has Nirmal babu found a job?

1055
01:28:05,710 --> 01:28:08,300
Not yet, but God willing, very soon.

1056
01:28:09,030 --> 01:28:10,930
How will you arrange
for so much money?

1057
01:28:11,700 --> 01:28:13,590
I will.
Come again after awhile.

1058
01:28:13,930 --> 01:28:16,040
Alright. Namaste.

1059
01:28:17,660 --> 01:28:18,960
Babul, come here.

1060
01:28:26,160 --> 01:28:28,600
Go to a jeweller's...

1061
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:30,750
and sell this for any amount.

1062
01:28:31,180 --> 01:28:33,080
This is the only thing left.

1063
01:28:33,410 --> 01:28:35,780
- Don't sell it.
- What to do Babul?

1064
01:28:36,200 --> 01:28:38,130
I have to think about the child.

1065
01:28:38,610 --> 01:28:40,880
We can spend our days
out in the open...

1066
01:28:41,570 --> 01:28:43,430
but the child needs a roof.

1067
01:28:45,990 --> 01:28:48,140
I know you're feeling bad.

1068
01:28:48,510 --> 01:28:50,030
But I have no choice.

1069
01:28:51,070 --> 01:28:53,750
Sell it and get money,
my dear brother.

1070
01:29:01,620 --> 01:29:02,870
Rs 240.

1071
01:29:04,420 --> 01:29:05,620
Rs 240?

1072
01:29:14,430 --> 01:29:15,730
Here's the rent.

1073
01:29:16,580 --> 01:29:18,680
- Did you borrow it?
- No.

1074
01:29:19,490 --> 01:29:21,720
I'd kept some aside for bad times.

1075
01:29:23,860 --> 01:29:26,250
Now you'll get a lot of milk to drink.

1076
01:29:26,390 --> 01:29:27,640
A full stomach.

1077
01:29:27,790 --> 01:29:29,950
A white moustache.

1078
01:29:30,200 --> 01:29:31,800
No hunger or thirst.

1079
01:29:32,240 --> 01:29:34,100
No crying.

1080
01:29:34,180 --> 01:29:36,250
Just drink milk and...

1081
01:29:36,540 --> 01:29:38,070
sleep.

1082
01:29:49,560 --> 01:29:51,160
Uma, very good news.

1083
01:29:51,530 --> 01:29:54,740
They need a man in Lahore.

1084
01:29:55,060 --> 01:29:56,910
I must go and meet him.

1085
01:29:58,370 --> 01:29:59,670
- Lahore?
- Yes.

1086
01:30:01,410 --> 01:30:04,980
- You'll have to go?
- Of course, or else no job.

1087
01:30:07,440 --> 01:30:08,440
Why?

1088
01:30:09,880 --> 01:30:10,880
Nothing.

1089
01:30:15,300 --> 01:30:16,600
Oh, I forgot.

1090
01:30:17,620 --> 01:30:20,620
There's nothing to eat, and I'm
dreaming of going to Lahore.

1091
01:30:35,590 --> 01:30:37,240
How much will you need?

1092
01:30:38,460 --> 01:30:40,790
A lot. Anyway, let it be.

1093
01:30:43,330 --> 01:30:44,480
How much?

1094
01:30:45,560 --> 01:30:47,350
At least Rs 50 or 60 or more.

1095
01:30:51,470 --> 01:30:54,000
Get ready. Money will be arranged.

1096
01:30:54,420 --> 01:30:56,150
- How?
- Not your concern.

1097
01:30:56,410 --> 01:30:59,160
- Get ready.
- No, I don't agree.

1098
01:31:00,770 --> 01:31:01,770
Why not?

1099
01:31:02,370 --> 01:31:05,400
I know you'll get the job.

1100
01:31:06,030 --> 01:31:07,400
My heart says so.

1101
01:31:09,920 --> 01:31:12,360
My heart is sinking.

1102
01:31:13,300 --> 01:31:14,700
If I don't get it?

1103
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:16,930
I'm sure you will.

1104
01:31:17,300 --> 01:31:18,600
At least go.

1105
01:31:19,530 --> 01:31:22,210
Write as soon as you get there.

1106
01:31:22,600 --> 01:31:24,350
Otherwise I'll get worried.

1107
01:31:24,830 --> 01:31:26,570
I can't decide what to do.

1108
01:31:28,310 --> 01:31:30,380
You should start packing at once.

1109
01:31:31,170 --> 01:31:32,170
Go.

1110
01:31:37,180 --> 01:31:39,170
You give me courage, Uma.

1111
01:31:39,590 --> 01:31:40,990
If I get the job...

1112
01:31:41,150 --> 01:31:42,550
it'll be your victory.

1113
01:31:43,080 --> 01:31:44,280
Come on.

1114
01:31:44,530 --> 01:31:46,440
Is my victory
any different from yours?

1115
01:31:49,190 --> 01:31:50,550
You go and get ready.

1116
01:31:50,880 --> 01:31:52,770
I'll return after feeding the baby.

1117
01:31:55,260 --> 01:31:56,260
Okay.

1118
01:32:04,220 --> 01:32:06,800
Now how will you manage?

1119
01:32:09,100 --> 01:32:11,140
The One who gave us a mouth
will also provide food.

1120
01:32:11,630 --> 01:32:14,290
Why worry? Right, Munni?

1121
01:33:46,750 --> 01:33:48,310
Dalip has come to see you.

1122
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:03,390
That's kind of you.
Please come.

1123
01:34:03,840 --> 01:34:05,236
You're great, sister in law.

1124
01:34:05,260 --> 01:34:07,460
Smiling in the midst of trouble?

1125
01:34:07,750 --> 01:34:09,650
Good and bad times are a part of life.

1126
01:34:10,100 --> 01:34:12,760
Why to cry? Please sit.

1127
01:34:13,360 --> 01:34:15,156
- What shall I serve?
- Bhabi (sister-in-law)...

1128
01:34:15,180 --> 01:34:16,750
I didn't come to get served.

1129
01:34:17,150 --> 01:34:19,990
It's my home, too.
I have something to say to you.

1130
01:34:20,470 --> 01:34:22,730
- What, bhaiya?
- So many days have passed...

1131
01:34:23,080 --> 01:34:24,730
and Nirmal hasn't written...

1132
01:34:25,080 --> 01:34:26,870
where and how he is.

1133
01:34:27,140 --> 01:34:29,130
What's he doing, while here you...

1134
01:34:29,220 --> 01:34:32,440
Bhaiya, he must be wandering
around looking for a job.

1135
01:34:32,950 --> 01:34:35,070
He didn't get the one he went for.

1136
01:34:35,660 --> 01:34:36,910
And lack of money.

1137
01:34:37,230 --> 01:34:39,220
He needs every paisa he has.

1138
01:34:41,220 --> 01:34:43,200
But you're having to starve.

1139
01:34:43,650 --> 01:34:45,100
No money even for Munni's milk.

1140
01:34:47,190 --> 01:34:48,490
It'll get better.

1141
01:34:49,050 --> 01:34:50,780
He'll be back soon.

1142
01:34:52,280 --> 01:34:53,580
And if he isn't?

1143
01:34:57,590 --> 01:34:59,520
No, no. This isn't good, bhabi.

1144
01:35:00,970 --> 01:35:03,600
Here, take. Janaki babu sent it.

1145
01:35:07,080 --> 01:35:09,170
Thank him on my behalf.

1146
01:35:09,710 --> 01:35:12,490
But I can't accept it, Dalip babu.

1147
01:35:13,630 --> 01:35:14,930
What's this, bhabi?

1148
01:35:15,250 --> 01:35:17,560
You always return the money he sends.

1149
01:35:17,980 --> 01:35:19,870
How long are you going to wait?

1150
01:35:20,370 --> 01:35:21,670
You're going hungry...

1151
01:35:21,890 --> 01:35:23,290
and also your child.

1152
01:35:23,730 --> 01:35:24,926
No, bhaiya.

1153
01:35:24,950 --> 01:35:26,570
God's given me hands and feet.

1154
01:35:26,940 --> 01:35:29,280
If nothing else, I'll work.

1155
01:35:29,760 --> 01:35:30,960
If that's so...

1156
01:35:31,010 --> 01:35:32,830
why not work at the theater?

1157
01:35:33,120 --> 01:35:35,240
In fact Janaki babu
has sent this message too.

1158
01:35:35,870 --> 01:35:37,980
- Yes?
- No, Dalip babu.

1159
01:35:38,370 --> 01:35:41,110
I can't, without his knowledge.

1160
01:35:41,590 --> 01:35:43,190
You won't work in the theater.

1161
01:35:43,550 --> 01:35:44,960
Won't take help.

1162
01:35:45,220 --> 01:35:46,220
Then?

1163
01:35:46,470 --> 01:35:48,010
Jobs aren't easy to get.

1164
01:35:48,960 --> 01:35:50,280
Just look at her.

1165
01:35:50,560 --> 01:35:52,490
She's half-dead from want of food.

1166
01:35:52,850 --> 01:35:54,150
Can't open her eyes.

1167
01:35:54,690 --> 01:35:56,400
Innocent, helpless.

1168
01:35:56,860 --> 01:35:59,260
She can't speak, she can't do anything.

1169
01:35:59,430 --> 01:36:02,470
- You'll kill her.
- No, don't say that.

1170
01:36:03,190 --> 01:36:04,290
What else?

1171
01:36:04,340 --> 01:36:06,500
I tell you, if she dies...

1172
01:36:06,710 --> 01:36:08,110
you'll cry all your life.

1173
01:36:36,460 --> 01:36:38,530
- Babul.
- Yes, didi.

1174
01:36:39,370 --> 01:36:40,990
Dalip bhaiya is right.

1175
01:36:42,230 --> 01:36:44,000
If something happens to her, then?

1176
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:47,770
No, no. I won't let it while I'm alive.

1177
01:36:48,300 --> 01:36:50,410
Babul, until I return...

1178
01:36:50,860 --> 01:36:52,360
stay with her.

1179
01:36:53,020 --> 01:36:54,220
If she cries...

1180
01:36:55,760 --> 01:36:57,370
put this in her mouth.

1181
01:36:58,120 --> 01:36:59,370
She'll be quiet.

1182
01:37:00,170 --> 01:37:01,420
But it's empty.

1183
01:37:03,270 --> 01:37:04,570
She'll be quiet.

1184
01:37:05,120 --> 01:37:07,030
I'll bring milk on my way back.

1185
01:37:08,930 --> 01:37:09,930
And...

1186
01:37:10,430 --> 01:37:12,610
don't leave her alone, okay?

1187
01:37:13,600 --> 01:37:14,700
No, didi.

1188
01:37:21,090 --> 01:37:22,090
Let's go.

1189
01:37:58,900 --> 01:38:02,090
Oh fair one,
meet me across the Ganga

1190
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:11,860
I'll put a gold ring on your finger

1191
01:38:21,990 --> 01:38:25,240
Meet me across the Ganga, my beloved

1192
01:38:33,100 --> 01:38:36,730
I'll come wearing a green chunari
(long piece of cloth)

1193
01:38:47,690 --> 01:38:53,190
My empty hut is situated
by the side of Ganga

1194
01:38:55,090 --> 01:39:00,260
I look out for you all afternoon

1195
01:39:23,600 --> 01:39:26,980
Come my rani with your water pot

1196
01:39:50,430 --> 01:39:54,080
I stand by Ganga
with my empty water pot

1197
01:39:59,740 --> 01:40:03,240
Restless like a fish out of water

1198
01:40:23,150 --> 01:40:26,310
Please swear to come, my raja

1199
01:40:41,070 --> 01:40:43,670
Across the Ganga

1200
01:40:46,370 --> 01:40:49,500
Our eyes...

1201
01:40:51,850 --> 01:40:53,180
will meet

1202
01:41:02,750 --> 01:41:05,890
No one should see us,
and throw a pebble

1203
01:41:29,920 --> 01:41:36,440
Oh fair one, oh my beloved,
meet me across the Ganga

1204
01:41:44,130 --> 01:41:45,660
Babul. I've found a job.

1205
01:41:45,780 --> 01:41:47,300
- Where?
- Later.

1206
01:41:47,620 --> 01:41:49,910
Where's Uma? Oh, my child.

1207
01:41:51,290 --> 01:41:54,750
My Munni. My daughter.

1208
01:41:55,660 --> 01:41:58,190
Lying here all alone. Where's Uma?

1209
01:42:04,630 --> 01:42:07,020
Where's Uma?
Why aren't you telling me?

1210
01:42:08,050 --> 01:42:09,150
What is it?

1211
01:42:09,330 --> 01:42:12,070
- Nothing.
- Then tell me where Uma is?

1212
01:42:12,820 --> 01:42:14,950
- She's gone to the theater.
- Theater?

1213
01:42:15,620 --> 01:42:17,950
- When?
- This evening.

1214
01:42:18,640 --> 01:42:20,070
But I told her not to.

1215
01:42:20,520 --> 01:42:23,690
There was no money
and Janaki babu wanted to help.

1216
01:42:23,950 --> 01:42:25,690
So he called didi.

1217
01:42:26,400 --> 01:42:29,680
Now I see the money's source.
She didn't tell me.

1218
01:42:30,290 --> 01:42:33,970
Forced me to go away, and went to dance
in the theater leaving the child alone.

1219
01:42:34,510 --> 01:42:38,230
It's not like that.
I'll explain everything.

1220
01:42:45,030 --> 01:42:47,520
Meena, I have to do something.

1221
01:42:48,290 --> 01:42:50,050
Please go out for a while.

1222
01:42:51,120 --> 01:42:52,960
Why for a while?

1223
01:42:53,630 --> 01:42:56,250
- We're going forever.
- What?

1224
01:42:56,720 --> 01:42:57,720
Yes.

1225
01:42:58,230 --> 01:43:00,660
After what happened today,
we can't stay here.

1226
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:02,400
I didn't understand.

1227
01:43:02,760 --> 01:43:04,060
Why would you?

1228
01:43:04,470 --> 01:43:07,290
Changed the act,
and made me a chorus girl.

1229
01:43:07,650 --> 01:43:09,150
Replaced me with her.

1230
01:43:09,570 --> 01:43:12,350
You don't see this humiliation?

1231
01:43:15,180 --> 01:43:18,320
I didn't mean to insult you.

1232
01:43:18,910 --> 01:43:20,850
I wanted to give Uma a chance.

1233
01:43:21,340 --> 01:43:23,520
She was in need. See?

1234
01:43:24,020 --> 01:43:26,300
The change was only for today.

1235
01:43:26,770 --> 01:43:28,540
There was no other way.

1236
01:43:29,420 --> 01:43:32,000
For her you always find a way.

1237
01:43:32,450 --> 01:43:34,270
Even if it hurts another.

1238
01:43:34,610 --> 01:43:36,270
Even when she's in disgrace.

1239
01:43:37,020 --> 01:43:38,760
We're only here to obey.

1240
01:43:39,780 --> 01:43:42,330
After all we're servants.

1241
01:43:44,180 --> 01:43:45,480
What do you say?

1242
01:43:47,100 --> 01:43:48,500
What's there to say?

1243
01:43:49,010 --> 01:43:51,670
Meena may be your employee,
but she's my daughter.

1244
01:43:52,270 --> 01:43:53,730
Her humiliation is mine.

1245
01:43:57,760 --> 01:43:59,180
Alright. Leave.

1246
01:44:03,210 --> 01:44:04,890
That's not right, Janaki babu.

1247
01:44:05,200 --> 01:44:06,980
Not because of me.

1248
01:44:07,510 --> 01:44:09,430
When anyone leaves,
I can't stop them.

1249
01:44:15,210 --> 01:44:18,420
Forgive me sister.
I don't want to deprive you.

1250
01:44:19,220 --> 01:44:20,780
Why are you going?

1251
01:44:21,220 --> 01:44:23,120
You wouldn't understand.

1252
01:44:23,860 --> 01:44:25,830
You haven't lost anything in life.

1253
01:44:26,310 --> 01:44:27,630
My heart knows...

1254
01:44:28,430 --> 01:44:31,330
you got whatever you wanted.
Snatched everything from me.

1255
01:44:31,770 --> 01:44:33,520
My name. My respect.

1256
01:44:33,820 --> 01:44:36,600
- And even my...
- That's enough.

1257
01:44:37,280 --> 01:44:39,110
Go if you want,
but don't say anymore.

1258
01:44:40,110 --> 01:44:41,110
Alright.

1259
01:44:42,860 --> 01:44:44,460
- We'll go.
- Go.

1260
01:44:55,310 --> 01:44:56,510
Take this.

1261
01:44:58,250 --> 01:45:00,570
You gave it to me
after my first success.

1262
01:45:02,230 --> 01:45:04,170
I'm returning this.

1263
01:45:13,100 --> 01:45:16,710
- Meena, where's Uma.
- In the office with Janaki babu.

1264
01:45:17,550 --> 01:45:20,190
Nirmal, you might be happy to know...

1265
01:45:20,680 --> 01:45:22,380
that I'm leaving here.

1266
01:45:23,890 --> 01:45:25,620
I always teased you...

1267
01:45:26,430 --> 01:45:28,620
but I've been punished. Anyway.

1268
01:45:29,210 --> 01:45:31,580
Before I go let's shake hands.

1269
01:45:31,830 --> 01:45:34,110
- You're leaving?
- Yes, forever.

1270
01:45:34,730 --> 01:45:36,420
I'm not needed here.

1271
01:45:36,930 --> 01:45:39,730
Uma's back.
She got what she wanted.

1272
01:45:40,030 --> 01:45:43,040
Why not?
Janki babu is generous to her.

1273
01:45:43,520 --> 01:45:46,310
And... anyway...
Let it be as it is.

1274
01:45:46,700 --> 01:45:50,070
We don't need to point fingers. Come.

1275
01:45:52,540 --> 01:45:53,940
Won't you shake hands?

1276
01:45:59,670 --> 01:46:01,840
I feel bad that...

1277
01:46:02,280 --> 01:46:04,200
they left because of me.

1278
01:46:04,350 --> 01:46:05,750
Not because of you.

1279
01:46:05,960 --> 01:46:07,580
They'd become arrogant.

1280
01:46:10,030 --> 01:46:12,170
When I do anything for you...

1281
01:46:12,710 --> 01:46:15,400
it's nobody's business
to interfere and insult you.

1282
01:46:15,760 --> 01:46:17,620
Yes, but...

1283
01:46:17,770 --> 01:46:19,070
Don't talk of them.

1284
01:46:19,190 --> 01:46:21,870
They always did as they wished.
I said nothing.

1285
01:46:27,220 --> 01:46:28,870
After you left...

1286
01:46:29,240 --> 01:46:31,060
I wanted to close down the theater.

1287
01:46:31,930 --> 01:46:34,660
Then I thought
you might need it one day.

1288
01:46:34,940 --> 01:46:36,290
So I let it run.

1289
01:46:37,740 --> 01:46:39,320
I didn't know...

1290
01:46:40,400 --> 01:46:42,400
you'd do so much for me.

1291
01:46:43,180 --> 01:46:45,120
How can I thank you?

1292
01:46:45,980 --> 01:46:47,570
No need, Uma.

1293
01:46:48,160 --> 01:46:50,000
I'm happy you came back.

1294
01:46:50,670 --> 01:46:52,430
The theater was waiting.

1295
01:46:52,880 --> 01:46:55,730
- It's yours, no?
- Yes.

1296
01:46:57,160 --> 01:47:00,600
You can't go anywhere now.
Nor will I let you suffer.

1297
01:47:01,250 --> 01:47:04,090
Whether you work or not,
you'll stay here.

1298
01:47:08,820 --> 01:47:12,470
When Nirmal returns,
I'll set him straight.

1299
01:47:13,550 --> 01:47:16,710
Okay, I'll go now. Baby is hungry.

1300
01:47:17,050 --> 01:47:18,880
- She must be crying.
- Yes, go.

1301
01:47:19,280 --> 01:47:20,580
Don't be long.

1302
01:47:20,980 --> 01:47:22,760
The next play's about to start.

1303
01:47:23,260 --> 01:47:25,560
And you come in at the beginning.
Here, take.

1304
01:47:29,660 --> 01:47:31,120
- So much!
- Yes.

1305
01:47:31,980 --> 01:47:33,780
Half from the owner of the theater...

1306
01:47:34,230 --> 01:47:35,610
half from your elder brother.

1307
01:47:36,150 --> 01:47:37,550
To his younger sister.

1308
01:47:38,440 --> 01:47:40,950
Okay now go. Listen!

1309
01:47:41,780 --> 01:47:44,960
Bring the baby with you.
I'll look after her.

1310
01:47:45,840 --> 01:47:48,210
Dalip, take her home in my car.

1311
01:47:48,560 --> 01:47:51,530
And you both must return quickly.

1312
01:48:09,250 --> 01:48:10,550
Where are you?

1313
01:48:10,870 --> 01:48:12,930
Where's Munni? Babul!

1314
01:48:23,690 --> 01:48:26,430
- What happened bhabi?
- There's no one at home.

1315
01:48:26,790 --> 01:48:29,520
Neither Babul nor Munni.
Where have they gone?

1316
01:48:34,090 --> 01:48:35,190
He's here.

1317
01:48:35,730 --> 01:48:38,480
They must've all gone to the theater
to get you. Come.

1318
01:48:58,600 --> 01:49:00,000
- Are they here?
- Who?

1319
01:49:00,440 --> 01:49:03,350
Babul, my child,
and your younger brother.

1320
01:49:03,620 --> 01:49:06,240
He's returned. No one's at home.

1321
01:49:06,520 --> 01:49:08,780
- They didn't come here.
- They didn't?

1322
01:49:09,900 --> 01:49:11,100
What is it?

1323
01:49:13,530 --> 01:49:15,390
Nirmal bhaiya took the child away.

1324
01:49:16,050 --> 01:49:17,430
Gone? Where?

1325
01:49:17,750 --> 01:49:20,140
I don't know. I tried to stop him,
but he wouldn't.

1326
01:49:20,550 --> 01:49:22,320
I ran behind his taxi.

1327
01:49:22,750 --> 01:49:24,050
But got tired.

1328
01:49:24,490 --> 01:49:26,650
Didi, he won't come back.

1329
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:28,740
Why did he leave?

1330
01:49:29,210 --> 01:49:31,020
Don't know. He'd just arrived.

1331
01:49:31,620 --> 01:49:32,930
He's found a job.

1332
01:49:33,330 --> 01:49:35,360
When I told him
you were at the theater...

1333
01:49:35,780 --> 01:49:37,240
he left in anger.

1334
01:49:37,770 --> 01:49:40,670
He came back with a taxi,
and left with baby.

1335
01:49:42,070 --> 01:49:43,370
He left this letter.

1336
01:49:49,800 --> 01:49:53,100
Uma, you've found your way,
I've found mine.

1337
01:49:53,950 --> 01:49:57,080
Our daughter mustn't get tainted
with her mother's disgrace.

1338
01:49:57,710 --> 01:49:59,430
So I'm taking her with me.

1339
01:49:59,920 --> 01:50:03,650
Don't search for me.
You're dead for us.

1340
01:50:04,360 --> 01:50:05,360
Nirmal

1341
01:50:26,840 --> 01:50:29,020
A ticket for Kalkotta.

1342
01:50:30,520 --> 01:50:31,520
Drink.

1343
01:50:34,680 --> 01:50:38,360
Babuji, why's didi so silent?
Why won't she talk?

1344
01:50:38,860 --> 01:50:40,910
Don't worry. She'll be alright.

1345
01:50:41,460 --> 01:50:44,050
Janki babu, Nirmal and Munni
must be found soon.

1346
01:50:45,800 --> 01:50:47,980
Yes, I'll inform the police.

1347
01:50:48,710 --> 01:50:51,560
- He couldn't have gone far.
- Janaki babu.

1348
01:50:53,830 --> 01:50:56,770
If you like, I'll go to the station.
He must have gone there.

1349
01:50:57,650 --> 01:50:58,850
Yes, go.

1350
01:51:02,770 --> 01:51:05,990
Didi, what's happening?
It's all my fault.

1351
01:51:06,720 --> 01:51:08,390
I forced you to come here.

1352
01:51:11,290 --> 01:51:13,330
Please speak. Say something.

1353
01:51:14,140 --> 01:51:16,060
Punish me. Beat me.

1354
01:51:18,890 --> 01:51:20,250
I'm ready.

1355
01:51:36,710 --> 01:51:38,350
My act is first.

1356
01:52:10,530 --> 01:52:15,900
What expectations one had from him

1357
01:52:17,240 --> 01:52:20,900
But what is he doing?

1358
01:52:27,980 --> 01:52:31,250
He built it up himself...

1359
01:52:31,420 --> 01:52:34,860
and is pulling it down himself

1360
01:52:47,380 --> 01:52:52,010
He came as love

1361
01:52:57,210 --> 01:53:04,620
But now has become tears

1362
01:53:10,120 --> 01:53:14,660
He made one laugh

1363
01:53:15,180 --> 01:53:18,480
He's now making one weep

1364
01:53:30,480 --> 01:53:38,480
This feeling of despondency

1365
01:53:40,170 --> 01:53:44,680
This helpless world

1366
01:54:01,840 --> 01:54:09,690
Even though my heart
is on fire, I still smile

1367
01:54:21,450 --> 01:54:25,690
Whose voice is this?

1368
01:54:27,370 --> 01:54:32,460
Who's calling me?

1369
01:54:43,530 --> 01:54:49,340
Someone tell me

1370
01:54:57,450 --> 01:55:00,790
Is it him, calling me?

1371
01:55:11,920 --> 01:55:17,070
Is he calling me?

1372
01:56:04,650 --> 01:56:06,420
No news of Nirmal.

1373
01:56:08,230 --> 01:56:09,860
The police are searching.

1374
01:56:12,110 --> 01:56:13,210
Don't worry.

1375
01:56:14,450 --> 01:56:16,550
I'll search every corner of the world.

1376
01:56:18,220 --> 01:56:19,530
Have courage.

1377
01:56:23,050 --> 01:56:25,640
Yes Uma, it's possible...

1378
01:56:26,290 --> 01:56:28,740
it'll take a long time. Months.

1379
01:56:29,560 --> 01:56:32,840
But he'll be found, definitely.

1380
01:56:34,640 --> 01:56:37,020
Your Munni will once again
play in your lap.

1381
01:56:38,410 --> 01:56:39,610
I promise.

1382
01:57:18,300 --> 01:57:19,800
What kind of horse is this?

1383
01:57:20,730 --> 01:57:22,220
It doesn't walk.

1384
01:57:22,440 --> 01:57:23,880
It's lame.

1385
01:57:24,300 --> 01:57:25,920
It can't walk.

1386
01:57:25,990 --> 01:57:27,930
It must walk.

1387
01:57:28,100 --> 01:57:30,430
- Come on.
- Okay. One...

1388
01:57:30,840 --> 01:57:32,210
two, and three.

1389
01:57:33,480 --> 01:57:35,820
Careful, we're coming.

1390
01:57:37,390 --> 01:57:39,490
It has come apart.

1391
01:57:39,640 --> 01:57:41,630
I don't care. Get up.

1392
01:57:46,200 --> 01:57:48,200
What happened babuji?
Why're you lying so.

1393
01:57:48,640 --> 01:57:51,260
The horse has fallen apart.

1394
01:57:51,700 --> 01:57:53,440
Right, horse?

1395
01:57:53,800 --> 01:57:56,940
No, Manju. Don't trouble babuji.

1396
01:57:57,280 --> 01:58:00,260
- His hands and feet will start hurting.
- Really, babuji?

1397
01:58:00,480 --> 01:58:03,350
- Becoming a horse hurts you?
- No beti (daughter)

1398
01:58:03,580 --> 01:58:05,350
I've been a horse all my life.

1399
01:58:05,750 --> 01:58:07,570
Last birth, and the one before that.

1400
01:58:08,460 --> 01:58:11,300
Put it here.
Come let's have breakfast.

1401
01:58:14,460 --> 01:58:15,760
Where's the paper?

1402
01:58:16,830 --> 01:58:19,000
Babuji, after you go to the office...

1403
01:58:19,160 --> 01:58:21,870
- what shall I do?
- No office today.

1404
01:58:22,330 --> 01:58:25,180
- It's Sunday.
- Oh, we can play all day long.

1405
01:58:25,380 --> 01:58:26,910
- Yes?
- What!

1406
01:58:27,460 --> 01:58:28,910
- Have you forgotten?
- What?

1407
01:58:29,770 --> 01:58:31,370
You're on the radio today.

1408
01:58:31,580 --> 01:58:33,450
Then we go to Bipin babu's.

1409
01:58:34,090 --> 01:58:35,240
Oh, yes!

1410
01:58:40,620 --> 01:58:42,880
- What happened babuji?
- Nothing.

1411
01:58:44,250 --> 01:58:45,790
You look strange.

1412
01:58:46,910 --> 01:58:48,470
- A picture.
- Whose?

1413
01:58:49,520 --> 01:58:51,350
- A woman's.
- What woman?

1414
01:58:51,900 --> 01:58:54,280
You don't know her.
She's come from far.

1415
01:58:54,870 --> 01:58:57,390
- She works in the theater.
- Show me.

1416
01:58:58,950 --> 01:59:02,470
Eight years have gone by.
It's a long period of time.

1417
01:59:03,270 --> 01:59:05,680
Perhaps another eight years
will go by.

1418
01:59:06,550 --> 01:59:09,040
But don't lose courage, Uma.

1419
01:59:09,750 --> 01:59:11,040
I believe...

1420
01:59:11,370 --> 01:59:13,580
your prayers will be answered.

1421
01:59:14,660 --> 01:59:15,960
What to do, Uma?

1422
01:59:16,380 --> 01:59:19,040
The world always punishes the innocent.

1423
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:21,860
But God must be seeing this.

1424
01:59:23,910 --> 01:59:27,590
- Janaki babu, the police inspector is here.
- Coming.

1425
01:59:28,550 --> 01:59:30,120
Don't be disheartened.

1426
01:59:30,570 --> 01:59:32,120
The police are trying.

1427
01:59:32,630 --> 01:59:35,510
He'll be found.
Why won't he be found?

1428
01:59:44,090 --> 01:59:46,050
Why don't you say something?

1429
01:59:46,360 --> 01:59:50,070
- Why don't you talk to me?
- Yes, beti. I will.

1430
01:59:54,800 --> 01:59:57,800
Babuji. If you go to the theater...

1431
01:59:58,390 --> 01:59:59,590
I'll come too.

1432
02:00:00,900 --> 02:00:02,200
Forget the radio.

1433
02:00:03,240 --> 02:00:06,200
The radio program is scheduled.
We'll go there.

1434
02:00:06,820 --> 02:00:09,970
- We'll go to the theater some other time, okay?
- Okay.

1435
02:00:14,940 --> 02:00:16,880
- Enough.
- What is it?

1436
02:00:17,140 --> 02:00:19,580
- What's the matter with you?
- I don't know.

1437
02:00:20,310 --> 02:00:24,390
My heart is sinking. Seems like
something's about to happen.

1438
02:00:24,530 --> 02:00:26,220
No, what can happen?

1439
02:00:27,410 --> 02:00:30,190
You were listening to the sitar
by pundit Babulal.

1440
02:00:30,840 --> 02:00:33,500
Our next program will start shortly.

1441
02:00:34,940 --> 02:00:37,010
Nunni, switch the radio off.

1442
02:00:43,590 --> 02:00:45,910
Children's program.

1443
02:00:46,380 --> 02:00:49,370
A song by Manju rani.

1444
02:00:49,830 --> 02:00:53,130
- What will you sing?
- 'You're welcome to'.

1445
02:00:54,240 --> 02:00:55,340
Okay, sing.

1446
02:00:55,970 --> 02:01:03,480
You're welcome to...

1447
02:01:03,930 --> 02:01:07,640
these lofty palaces

1448
02:01:08,450 --> 02:01:12,150
We love our own lanes

1449
02:01:35,850 --> 02:01:40,740
In spite of living in palaces
you get no peace

1450
02:01:43,820 --> 02:01:48,640
Those who sleep in these lanes
on sheets of sorrow...

1451
02:01:51,880 --> 02:01:56,080
are the ones who rejoice
and revel in their dreams

1452
02:02:12,430 --> 02:02:17,470
You're bewitched by your wealth
of gold and silver

1453
02:02:20,690 --> 02:02:25,620
Our heart is our wealth

1454
02:02:28,750 --> 02:02:34,140
You might think our tears
are water from the eyes

1455
02:02:39,710 --> 02:02:43,670
For us they are strings of pearls

1456
02:02:53,690 --> 02:02:57,080
We love our lanes

1457
02:03:00,850 --> 02:03:02,700
Babul, remember this song?

1458
02:03:03,010 --> 02:03:05,870
Yes didi. The one you sang
in front of the house.

1459
02:03:05,960 --> 02:03:08,860
- Yes it's the same.
- But no one else knows this song...

1460
02:03:09,080 --> 02:03:10,850
- except him.
- Who's the girl singing?

1461
02:03:10,950 --> 02:03:12,840
- Find out quickly.
- Yes.

1462
02:03:22,790 --> 02:03:25,010
Operator. Please give
me the radio station.

1463
02:03:25,940 --> 02:03:27,330
Yes. Please be quick.

1464
02:03:28,310 --> 02:03:31,560
Plot number 235.

1465
02:03:33,210 --> 02:03:34,310
Park Road.

1466
02:03:35,900 --> 02:03:37,600
Thank you.

1467
02:03:38,010 --> 02:03:39,490
Babul get a taxi, quickly.

1468
02:03:39,760 --> 02:03:42,066
- Give this.
- You're going there? - Yes.

1469
02:03:42,090 --> 02:03:43,186
He's here.

1470
02:03:43,210 --> 02:03:45,480
My daughter too.
I can't wait here anymore.

1471
02:03:45,710 --> 02:03:48,340
- Okay lets go.
- No, first I'll go alone.

1472
02:03:48,670 --> 02:03:51,520
It's an unknown place.
Don't go alone.

1473
02:03:53,020 --> 02:03:54,820
- Dalip, go with her.
- Alright.

1474
02:04:10,250 --> 02:04:13,050
Bhabi, this is it. Found it finally.

1475
02:04:18,250 --> 02:04:20,560
- I'll go first.
- Why? Let's go together.

1476
02:04:20,950 --> 02:04:24,130
No, you wait here.
I'll send for you.

1477
02:04:28,740 --> 02:04:31,220
Here. Let me look.

1478
02:04:31,950 --> 02:04:33,500
You're blooming like a flower, beti.

1479
02:04:33,800 --> 02:04:36,500
- Give me my present for this.
- Here.

1480
02:04:37,890 --> 02:04:40,150
Babuji, a lady's come to see you.

1481
02:04:40,930 --> 02:04:42,850
Okay. What?

1482
02:04:43,910 --> 02:04:47,270
- A lady? - Yes.
- Who is it?

1483
02:04:48,480 --> 02:04:51,130
She didn't say.
But wants to meet with you.

1484
02:04:51,820 --> 02:04:54,620
- Who is it, father?
- Somebody.

1485
02:04:54,920 --> 02:04:57,820
I'll go and see.
You put on your shoes.

1486
02:05:06,590 --> 02:05:08,710
Yes. What would you like?

1487
02:05:12,800 --> 02:05:15,410
You? How did you come here?

1488
02:05:16,440 --> 02:05:17,790
I'll tell you all.

1489
02:05:19,730 --> 02:05:21,250
There's a lot to tell.

1490
02:05:21,860 --> 02:05:23,930
- Where is she?
- Who?

1491
02:05:24,190 --> 02:05:25,710
Munni. Our Munni.

1492
02:05:28,370 --> 02:05:30,390
- Okay. Please sit.
- I will sit...

1493
02:05:30,780 --> 02:05:32,200
but first bring her to me.

1494
02:05:32,620 --> 02:05:36,180
- My heart is restless.
- Babuji, I'm ready.

1495
02:05:37,900 --> 02:05:41,020
I'm coming beti. You stay there.

1496
02:05:46,130 --> 02:05:50,510
Why did you bolt the door?
Call her please.

1497
02:05:55,920 --> 02:05:58,010
You won't bring my child to me?

1498
02:06:00,120 --> 02:06:03,210
Uma, listen. I'll tell you frankly.

1499
02:06:03,690 --> 02:06:04,930
Frankly?

1500
02:06:05,660 --> 02:06:08,220
It's been ages.
Have you not forgiven me?

1501
02:06:08,830 --> 02:06:10,530
Punishing me still...

1502
02:06:10,870 --> 02:06:13,940
- for no fault?
- It's not that. It's something else.

1503
02:06:14,850 --> 02:06:15,950
Reason?

1504
02:06:16,740 --> 02:06:18,600
You left me without reason.

1505
02:06:19,260 --> 02:06:21,400
I've been living on one hope only.

1506
02:06:22,080 --> 02:06:23,400
For the day...

1507
02:06:24,030 --> 02:06:27,160
when you'd listen
and once again love me.

1508
02:06:29,710 --> 02:06:32,530
Munni's your daughter, mine too.

1509
02:06:32,940 --> 02:06:36,130
I can't live without her.
I'm her mother.

1510
02:06:38,560 --> 02:06:41,440
Uma, I have no choice.

1511
02:06:46,260 --> 02:06:47,910
Why?

1512
02:06:48,910 --> 02:06:52,460
I've told her you're dead.

1513
02:06:54,880 --> 02:06:57,450
Tell her I'm not dead.

1514
02:06:57,710 --> 02:07:00,580
- I'm alive.
- How to tell her...

1515
02:07:01,060 --> 02:07:03,640
that her mother's a dancer.

1516
02:07:04,140 --> 02:07:06,890
It will spread,
and her life will be ruined.

1517
02:07:07,390 --> 02:07:09,490
No, I can't do this.

1518
02:07:13,020 --> 02:07:15,510
Then let's go
and live in another place.

1519
02:07:15,960 --> 02:07:17,850
Where no one will find out.

1520
02:07:18,080 --> 02:07:21,660
We'll start a new life.
I won't work in the theater.

1521
02:07:22,060 --> 02:07:24,770
- I don't like it myself.
- No. Uma.

1522
02:07:25,130 --> 02:07:27,950
Your name will follow us everywhere.

1523
02:07:28,710 --> 02:07:32,310
I've worked hard
for this business and respect.

1524
02:07:32,610 --> 02:07:34,750
Because of Munni.
I can't leave all this.

1525
02:07:35,390 --> 02:07:37,570
- Munni needs all this.
- Babuji.

1526
02:07:38,270 --> 02:07:41,130
Please come. I'm ready.

1527
02:07:41,600 --> 02:07:43,520
We have a guest.

1528
02:07:43,890 --> 02:07:45,990
I'm speaking with her.
I'll come in a minute.

1529
02:07:46,720 --> 02:07:48,200
Bring her to me.

1530
02:07:50,560 --> 02:07:52,970
I beg you. Please bring her.

1531
02:07:53,690 --> 02:07:56,570
No, Uma. Don't ruin her life.

1532
02:07:57,270 --> 02:07:58,670
Don't disgrace her.

1533
02:07:59,330 --> 02:08:02,070
Finally I have a house, name, respect.

1534
02:08:02,720 --> 02:08:04,120
Don't snatch it away.

1535
02:08:05,080 --> 02:08:07,030
Let her live happily.

1536
02:08:21,320 --> 02:08:26,630
Okay. Let me see her, just once.

1537
02:08:28,350 --> 02:08:29,830
I'll go away after that.

1538
02:08:36,780 --> 02:08:39,100
Babuji. Why did you bolt it?

1539
02:08:39,490 --> 02:08:40,800
Let me come.

1540
02:08:41,890 --> 02:08:43,740
Yes, I'll open it.

1541
02:08:45,160 --> 02:08:47,840
Just wait, Uma. Promise...

1542
02:08:48,350 --> 02:08:50,740
you won't tell her that...

1543
02:08:51,390 --> 02:08:52,740
you're her mother.

1544
02:08:53,960 --> 02:08:55,360
And never come back.

1545
02:08:58,640 --> 02:08:59,640
Speak.

1546
02:09:14,420 --> 02:09:17,300
Manju, she wants to meet you.

1547
02:09:19,010 --> 02:09:22,150
- She's known us for a long time.
- Namaste.

1548
02:09:26,480 --> 02:09:27,510
Namaste.

1549
02:09:31,150 --> 02:09:32,250
Come here.

1550
02:10:05,940 --> 02:10:07,570
You're so pretty, beti.

1551
02:10:08,780 --> 02:10:10,750
Even your name is pretty.

1552
02:10:11,910 --> 02:10:12,910
Manju.

1553
02:10:14,020 --> 02:10:16,410
- Who gave you this name?
- My mother.

1554
02:10:23,230 --> 02:10:24,230
Mother?

1555
02:10:27,310 --> 02:10:29,750
- Do you remember her?
- No.

1556
02:10:29,880 --> 02:10:32,100
I was very small when she died.

1557
02:10:32,480 --> 02:10:33,940
Babuji says...

1558
02:10:38,020 --> 02:10:41,550
- What does he say?
- That my mother was very beautiful.

1559
02:10:42,110 --> 02:10:43,110
Wait.

1560
02:10:54,470 --> 02:10:56,230
This is my mother.

1561
02:10:57,280 --> 02:11:00,340
This is me. Do you like her?

1562
02:11:01,390 --> 02:11:02,390
Yes.

1563
02:11:03,540 --> 02:11:06,460
Babuji says my mother was very nice.

1564
02:11:06,760 --> 02:11:10,180
And I should be like her. I will be.

1565
02:11:10,440 --> 02:11:12,910
- Right?
- Yes, beti.

1566
02:11:14,210 --> 02:11:15,210
Sure.

1567
02:11:16,600 --> 02:11:18,500
But she was very unlucky, Manju.

1568
02:11:18,890 --> 02:11:20,290
Why? How do you know?

1569
02:11:21,700 --> 02:11:23,420
I knew her.

1570
02:11:25,350 --> 02:11:26,940
She was my friend.

1571
02:11:27,830 --> 02:11:30,360
She loved me a lot.

1572
02:11:30,450 --> 02:11:32,600
Really? You've seen her?

1573
02:11:33,730 --> 02:11:35,390
Tell me about her.

1574
02:11:36,510 --> 02:11:39,450
If I tell you, will you love me?

1575
02:11:39,610 --> 02:11:40,810
Yes, a lot.

1576
02:11:59,590 --> 02:12:02,450
We should leave now,
or else we'll be late.

1577
02:12:03,550 --> 02:12:04,950
We have to go somewhere.

1578
02:12:07,520 --> 02:12:08,920
You have to go?

1579
02:12:10,340 --> 02:12:13,550
Alright. Then go, beti.

1580
02:12:14,170 --> 02:12:15,470
I'll come again.

1581
02:12:15,810 --> 02:12:19,180
- I'll tell you all about your mother.
- When will that be?

1582
02:12:21,680 --> 02:12:23,270
- You tell me.
- Tomorrow.

1583
02:12:26,350 --> 02:12:27,350
Alright.

1584
02:13:03,530 --> 02:13:07,350
- Manju. - Yes?
- You said...

1585
02:13:08,020 --> 02:13:10,010
you love me a lot.

1586
02:13:11,400 --> 02:13:14,050
If I ask you for something,
will you give it?

1587
02:13:14,460 --> 02:13:15,660
Yes. What?

1588
02:13:23,240 --> 02:13:27,020
Your doll. When I look at it...

1589
02:13:28,010 --> 02:13:30,040
I will think of you.

1590
02:13:30,840 --> 02:13:34,600
Yes, take it. I don't play with dolls.

1591
02:13:36,860 --> 02:13:38,500
Be happy, my child.

1592
02:13:40,870 --> 02:13:42,920
May God protect you.

1593
02:14:02,780 --> 02:14:05,060
Babuji, she's nice.

1594
02:14:05,610 --> 02:14:07,220
She loves me a lot.

1595
02:14:07,500 --> 02:14:10,590
When she comes tomorrow,
I'll play with her the whole day.

1596
02:14:10,880 --> 02:14:13,250
- Yes?
- Yes, beti.

1597
02:14:15,550 --> 02:14:17,100
Come. Wear your coat.

1598
02:14:18,660 --> 02:14:20,450
How was it? Did you see them?

1599
02:14:22,020 --> 02:14:24,390
Yes. I met them.

1600
02:14:25,430 --> 02:14:26,820
Saw Munni.

1601
02:14:27,740 --> 02:14:31,050
She's grown up now.
Talks very sweetly.

1602
02:14:32,280 --> 02:14:33,900
She gave me this doll.

1603
02:14:34,250 --> 02:14:35,450
For keeps.

1604
02:14:36,650 --> 02:14:37,950
What is it bhabi?

1605
02:14:39,520 --> 02:14:43,520
Nothing bhaiya.
Munni will stay with him.

1606
02:14:44,230 --> 02:14:46,280
She has a name, a good house...

1607
02:14:46,780 --> 02:14:48,220
and needs respect, right?

1608
02:14:48,840 --> 02:14:50,860
I can't snatch this all away.

1609
02:14:51,830 --> 02:14:54,440
You wait here.
I'll be back right away.

1610
02:15:20,640 --> 02:15:23,830
- Are you hurt?
- Don't know.

1611
02:15:25,440 --> 02:15:27,280
Uma, are you alright?

1612
02:15:28,670 --> 02:15:30,390
Yes, I'm alright.

1613
02:15:31,470 --> 02:15:34,260
It wasn't my fault.
She came in the way.

1614
02:15:34,580 --> 02:15:36,590
- I was...
- It's okay.

1615
02:15:37,290 --> 02:15:39,570
Bhabi, can you stand?

1616
02:15:49,160 --> 02:15:52,700
- If you want I can take her.
- Yes, that would be fine.

1617
02:15:58,950 --> 02:16:00,150
Come bhabi.

1618
02:16:27,420 --> 02:16:29,210
- Where are you?
- Manju?

1619
02:16:32,680 --> 02:16:36,240
- Manju, do you like the lady who came?
- Very much.

1620
02:16:36,459 --> 02:16:38,269
- What if she lives with us?
- Really?

1621
02:16:38,580 --> 02:16:40,840
Then I'll play in her lap all day.

1622
02:16:41,230 --> 02:16:44,390
And if I tell you she's your mother?

1623
02:16:44,540 --> 02:16:48,530
My mother? But you said she's dead.

1624
02:16:49,020 --> 02:16:50,530
Yes, I said.

1625
02:16:50,879 --> 02:16:54,119
But if I tell you she's alive?

1626
02:16:55,430 --> 02:16:57,570
Wouldn't she have come to me?

1627
02:16:59,240 --> 02:17:02,120
Listen, beti, I told you a lie.

1628
02:17:02,370 --> 02:17:05,930
- What? - Yes, she's not dead.
- Not dead?

1629
02:17:06,100 --> 02:17:08,860
No, she's alive.
The lady who came...

1630
02:17:09,190 --> 02:17:11,060
she's your mother.

1631
02:17:11,750 --> 02:17:13,370
Babuji, I want to go to her.

1632
02:17:13,530 --> 02:17:16,420
- I want to...
- Yes, beti, yes.

1633
02:17:27,400 --> 02:17:28,400
What happened?

1634
02:17:32,020 --> 02:17:33,720
Come, I'll tell you.

1635
02:17:53,940 --> 02:17:58,960
Manju, forgive me. I'll never be
able to meet you again.

1636
02:18:00,330 --> 02:18:02,240
May God always keep you happy.

1637
02:18:39,639 --> 02:18:41,869
Driver, hurry up.

1638
02:20:14,180 --> 02:20:16,520
Manju, I'm here, beti.

1639
02:20:21,190 --> 02:20:22,290
My child.

1640
02:20:30,530 --> 02:20:32,440
What happened?

1641
02:20:35,040 --> 02:20:37,100
- Didi.
- I've found my child.

1642
02:20:45,610 --> 02:20:49,070
Thank God. Let me see, beti.

1643
02:20:51,160 --> 02:20:52,260
How pretty.

1644
02:20:59,340 --> 02:21:00,690
Where are you going?

1645
02:21:01,370 --> 02:21:03,510
What I should've done earlier...

1646
02:21:04,340 --> 02:21:07,780
I've done today. Now I'm
not needed so I'm going.

1647
02:21:08,720 --> 02:21:12,100
Listen. Come into this room.
I must say something.

1648
02:21:21,800 --> 02:21:23,600
You don't want to live with Uma?

1649
02:21:26,400 --> 02:21:29,800
- May I ask why?
- She might not need me anymore.

1650
02:21:32,530 --> 02:21:34,210
Perhaps you don't know...

1651
02:21:35,280 --> 02:21:37,960
I'm longing to fulfill a lifelong wish.

1652
02:21:39,040 --> 02:21:40,910
I've not been able to fulfill it yet.

1653
02:21:41,820 --> 02:21:42,820
What?

1654
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:45,000
This.

1655
02:21:46,760 --> 02:21:50,170
Come on. You can reciprocate.

1656
02:21:50,810 --> 02:21:53,670
No, bhaiya. I deserve it.

1657
02:21:53,750 --> 02:21:56,880
Yes, you did. Stupid. Come on.

1658
02:22:04,620 --> 02:22:07,570
- Ask her forgiveness.
- No, there's no need.

1659
02:22:07,820 --> 02:22:09,870
Why not? Hold your ears.

1660
02:22:11,820 --> 02:22:15,240
There goes the bell.
Get to work everyone.

1661
02:22:29,580 --> 02:22:31,340
Make way.

1662
02:22:45,980 --> 02:22:47,570
Sisters, and brothers...

1663
02:22:48,080 --> 02:22:51,800
I'm going to introduce a new artist today.

1664
02:22:52,270 --> 02:22:54,810
I mean, my daughter, Manju.

1665
02:24:48,460 --> 02:24:50,520
Come tomorrow, and I'll sing more.

1666
02:24:56,070 --> 02:24:57,490
Very good! Very good!

1667
02:25:07,240 --> 02:25:10,800
Dear friend, the spring has arrived,
and longing has ended

1668
02:25:10,840 --> 02:25:13,040
The woods are blooming
