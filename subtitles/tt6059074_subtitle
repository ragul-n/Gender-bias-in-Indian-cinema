1
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:26,443
WOW!

2
00:04:26,499 --> 00:04:27,807
The new Benz is here?

3
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:33,373
Awesome!

4
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,983
He's a tiger, Dasan!

5
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:36,513
Didn't you get the number?

6
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:38,021
Yes. Got it.
Number 1.

7
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:40,412
I didn't fix it because I
didn't want to be late.

8
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:41,983
Then fix it quickly, man!

9
00:04:42,048 --> 00:04:44,892
When Vincent sees the car for the first
time, let him see it as No.1.

10
00:04:45,084 --> 00:04:46,290
By the way.

11
00:04:46,352 --> 00:04:47,695
How much did this No.1 cost?

12
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:49,397
Just 4 Iakh Rupees.

13
00:04:49,722 --> 00:04:51,861
With 4 Iakhs, you can
buy a new car, right?

14
00:04:51,924 --> 00:04:52,924
That's true.

15
00:04:52,925 --> 00:04:56,295
But there are 10 millionaires in this
Thrissur who're ready to pay even 4 crores

16
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,730
- for this No.1, if they are provoked.
- That's true.

17
00:04:58,731 --> 00:05:00,766
In that way, this is a
profit, Ravunni ettan!

18
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:01,871
What profit?

19
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:05,437
Inside, the event managers who've
come to host the wedding,

20
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:06,738
are trying to make it grander!

21
00:05:06,739 --> 00:05:10,375
If he starts spending, Vincent
spends money like water!

22
00:05:10,376 --> 00:05:11,548
That's true!

23
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:14,691
We've ordered food for only 2000 people.
That's a fixed amount.

24
00:05:14,747 --> 00:05:17,990
But we've invited all the employees
of the transport company <i>&</i> textiles.

25
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:20,861
- They're not added in this.
- Why didn't you? Add them too!

26
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:22,754
So it's Rs.800 per extra person,

27
00:05:22,755 --> 00:05:24,860
and for 44 people
from textiles...

28
00:05:25,591 --> 00:05:26,797
35,200.

29
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:29,472
That's correct!

30
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:30,529
Vincent!

31
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:32,737
Haven't you counted the people
from our transport com pany?

32
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:37,338
Drivers, conductors <i>&</i> workshop workers
altogether would come around 64 people.

33
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:38,914
So 64 X 800.

34
00:05:39,472 --> 00:05:40,772
51,200.

35
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:43,811
There are 24 people who are the permanent
staff of the construction company.

36
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:45,885
You should've checked
this earlier, right?

37
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:47,686
24 X 800.

38
00:05:47,914 --> 00:05:49,086
19,200.

39
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:51,419
Plus, 35,200.

40
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:53,625
Plus 51,200.

41
00:05:54,487 --> 00:05:55,966
1,05,600.

42
00:05:58,157 --> 00:06:00,459
Have you seen Rajnikanth's
movie Endhiran (Robot)?

43
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,133
You don't have to be
Endhiran (Robot) for this!

44
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,899
Business itself is a
mental calculation!

45
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:06,870
You can get up now.

46
00:06:11,637 --> 00:06:13,739
Doctor, Wikipedia says that
Carpal tunnel syndrome

47
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,141
can happen even when
Thyroid levels go down!

48
00:06:16,142 --> 00:06:17,746
Is it?
Then it must be correct.

49
00:06:17,977 --> 00:06:19,479
Wikipedia doesn't lie.

50
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:21,820
So we'll do a Thyroid
test, right?

51
00:06:21,914 --> 00:06:22,915
Why not! We can!

52
00:06:23,182 --> 00:06:25,162
Our hospital gives a
good rate as well!

53
00:06:25,618 --> 00:06:27,655
So should I take some
medicines for the time being?

54
00:06:28,154 --> 00:06:29,929
Hasn't Wikipedia said
anything about that?

55
00:06:29,989 --> 00:06:32,094
Well.. There are some
medicines mentioned in it..

56
00:06:32,158 --> 00:06:33,136
<i>'</i> Rea" v? _ Yes!

57
00:06:33,192 --> 00:06:35,832
So firstly, let's get your Thyroid
checked like Wikipedia said.

58
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:37,804
By the time the result comes,

59
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:39,976
I'll also check for more
details in Wikipedia.

60
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,478
One minute!

61
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:43,635
To have until the result comes,

62
00:06:43,636 --> 00:06:45,980
I'll prescribe some vitamin
tablets <i>&</i> painkillers.

63
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:47,608
- Is it really necessary?
- Of course!

64
00:06:47,673 --> 00:06:49,875
I'll have to buy them from
this pharmacy itself, right?

65
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:52,152
Yes. Here you can get
original medicines!

66
00:06:52,211 --> 00:06:55,488
This hospital belongs to your
father-in-law, Dr. Kuriakose, right?

67
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:56,726
Yes!

68
00:06:56,783 --> 00:06:57,761
Okay then!

69
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:00,589
No more patients.

70
00:07:00,653 --> 00:07:02,154
People are still waiting
outside, right?

71
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:05,157
They're not patients. They are real
estate brokers here to meet you!

72
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:06,899
Really? Ask them to come fast!

73
00:07:07,026 --> 00:07:08,004
You can go in!

74
00:07:09,695 --> 00:07:10,862
- Greetings!
- Greetings!

75
00:07:10,863 --> 00:07:11,864
Please sit down.

76
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:16,671
- Is Dr.Alphonse's duty over?
- OP is over. But there are brokers inside.

77
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:19,971
He is not even concerned that it's
his sister's wedding tomorrow!

78
00:07:19,972 --> 00:07:22,009
If you leave the
space for this road,

79
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:24,188
we'll get 40 clean plots.

80
00:07:24,877 --> 00:07:26,686
I'll sell ten of them.

81
00:07:26,979 --> 00:07:28,515
How many can you sell?

82
00:07:29,048 --> 00:07:30,823
- I can also sell around ten.
- That's enough!

83
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:36,225
Okay then. It's my
sister's wedding tomorrow.

84
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:37,722
She's upset that I'm late.

85
00:07:37,723 --> 00:07:39,891
Aren't you inviting us for
your sister's wedding, Sir'?

86
00:07:39,892 --> 00:07:42,702
Oops. All the lists
are completed. I'm sorry! See you!

87
00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:47,135
He is that Vincent's son.

88
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,578
The apple doesn't fall far
from the tree, you know!

89
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:50,773
Come fast, Alphie!

90
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:53,205
Don't be so restless. Dad
<i>&</i> Jomon are there, right?

91
00:07:53,206 --> 00:07:56,517
Right! Jomon! He'll promise to do
anything <i>&</i> everything! But after that?

92
00:07:56,576 --> 00:07:58,910
He went to Coimbatore yesterday.
And he's still not back!

93
00:07:58,911 --> 00:08:00,652
He's your brother, right?
Best family!

94
00:08:00,713 --> 00:08:01,780
Don't be upset, dear!

95
00:08:01,781 --> 00:08:03,522
Stop being cheesy
<i>&</i> start the car, Alphie!

96
00:08:03,716 --> 00:08:06,595
Your sisters will think that
I'm not being responsible!

97
00:08:07,753 --> 00:08:09,596
The designs are all great, right?

98
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:11,865
She found them from a website!

99
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:14,237
This looks really elegant.

100
00:08:14,293 --> 00:08:15,897
This Saree is beautiful.

101
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:17,496
It will suit you
really well, Tessa.

102
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:20,603
I'll be wearing a different dress for
the reception after the Church wedding.

103
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,612
It's special works are
being done in Coimbatore.

104
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:24,079
Jomon will bring it
when he comes back.

105
00:08:24,136 --> 00:08:26,082
- No juice for me?
- Of course!

106
00:08:26,205 --> 00:08:27,205
Lali!

107
00:08:27,206 --> 00:08:28,940
- Yes, grandma!
- What are their names?

108
00:08:28,941 --> 00:08:30,784
- He's Noel <i>&</i> she's Nora.
- What?

109
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:32,049
Noel <i>&</i> Nora!

110
00:08:32,111 --> 00:08:33,715
<i>La“, where's my purse?</i>

111
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:35,918
That was in the pocket of your
pants I gave for laundry.

112
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:37,682
- I've kept it in the draw.
- Which draw?

113
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:39,060
Our dressing table's draw.

114
00:08:39,118 --> 00:08:40,756
I checked all over there.
I can't find it.

115
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:42,628
Go get it for him.
He's your husband, right?

116
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:44,759
Hold her!
I'm coming!

117
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:48,298
Just about 300 metres
away from the main road.

118
00:08:48,961 --> 00:08:51,100
From there, a 5 metre
wide pocket road.

119
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:54,504
There are only a couple of plots left.
Tell me if you want any.

120
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:55,767
Dr. Jeslie,

121
00:08:55,768 --> 00:08:58,305
I don't think Dr.Alphonse would be
coming to the hospital anymore.

122
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,643
He's going to focus on real
estate as a full-time job.

123
00:09:00,773 --> 00:09:02,878
I've also felt that it would
be better if he does that.

124
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:07,120
By the way, our Thrisshur is going
to be India's fastest growing city!

125
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:08,954
It's better to buy
some land before that.

126
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:11,993
Buddy, if you don't want it, ask
your brother-in-law in Dubai.

127
00:09:19,992 --> 00:09:23,995
Alphie, who has arranged the cars
from the Church to the hall tomorrow?

128
00:09:23,996 --> 00:09:25,998
Isn't that a part of the event
management contract?

129
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:27,703
They said that they
can't do that.

130
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:29,178
<i>The“ demon must have
taken that up tea'.!</i>

131
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:30,270
Then where is he?

132
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:31,974
He hasn't returned
from Coimbatore.

133
00:09:32,171 --> 00:09:33,878
Did you ask Palodan
uncle to do it?

134
00:09:33,973 --> 00:09:34,973
Then great!

135
00:09:34,974 --> 00:09:37,978
If he starts ruling the Corporation
from the back seat of his wife's car,

136
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:39,352
then he won't remember
anything else!

137
00:09:53,225 --> 00:09:54,602
- Brajitha,
- Yes!

138
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:55,660
Here!

139
00:09:55,661 --> 00:09:57,140
Sign below this seal.

140
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,739
Is it enough if I
cast my fingerprint?

141
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:00,777
No!

142
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:03,006
Didn't I teach you
to draw a signature?

143
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:04,342
Just draw that!

144
00:10:04,704 --> 00:10:06,911
Or will I have to
do that as well?

145
00:10:11,844 --> 00:10:12,822
Here!

146
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:17,215
The guy who needs this would
be waiting on the road.

147
00:10:17,216 --> 00:10:19,093
Be careful when you
take cash from him.

148
00:10:19,185 --> 00:10:21,859
We wouldn't know where they
keep their hidden cameras!

149
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:24,696
Are you teaching this
Palodan how to take bribes?

150
00:10:24,757 --> 00:10:27,058
It's only because the Mayor
seat was reserved for women,

151
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:29,596
that I have to sit in this
back-seat and rule the city.

152
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:32,208
There he is.

153
00:10:32,398 --> 00:10:33,877
Stop here, Josootty.

154
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,278
They're coming!

155
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:41,239
Hey!

156
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,049
What are you looking
at over there?

157
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:46,053
- Namaste!
- Namaste!

158
00:10:46,178 --> 00:10:47,213
Namaste, madam!

159
00:10:47,346 --> 00:10:49,748
We'll share one
Namaste between us.

160
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:52,059
- I got tensed when you were late.
- You got tensed?

161
00:10:52,118 --> 00:10:53,358
- What is this?
- It's a talisman!

162
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:55,763
Talisman? What about this?
- Buttons.

163
00:10:56,288 --> 00:10:58,223
Give it here. Let me see.

164
00:10:58,224 --> 00:11:00,091
You're still ticklish?

165
00:11:00,092 --> 00:11:02,794
My dear Palodan Sir,
don't turn it around.

166
00:11:02,795 --> 00:11:03,928
<i>It's</i> not <i>a camera.</i>

167
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:06,773
I know that it's not a camera. I was
checking if it had ink, you idiot!

168
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:08,243
Get me the stuff!

169
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:10,647
Over here!

170
00:11:12,238 --> 00:11:14,081
Huh? Note counting machine?

171
00:11:22,815 --> 00:11:24,123
Here you 9°!
Happy?

172
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:27,459
If you need anything more,
don't go to the office. Just tell me.

173
00:11:27,953 --> 00:11:28,931
Madam, thanks!

174
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:31,764
Do one thing! Get a mic <i>&</i>
announce this thanks to everyone!

175
00:11:31,824 --> 00:11:33,098
That's not how you say it.

176
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:36,333
Don't give me that wicked look.
People will doubt us. Get going!

177
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:37,674
Start the car!

178
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:43,446
Brajitha,

179
00:11:43,502 --> 00:11:46,483
Ask them to drop you home in their
car after the inauguration!

180
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,379
And ya, don't forget
to get the packet.

181
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:49,681
You're so greedy!

182
00:11:54,947 --> 00:11:55,925
Namaste!

183
00:12:03,956 --> 00:12:05,323
What's it, aliya
(brother-in-law)?

184
00:12:05,324 --> 00:12:08,326
Aliya, aren't you arranging the cars
to go from the Church to the hall?

185
00:12:08,327 --> 00:12:09,931
No. Not me!

186
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:12,201
Jomon is supposed to arrange it!
Ask him!

187
00:12:12,364 --> 00:12:13,342
Phew!

188
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:17,210
After promising to arrange everything,
where has that donkey gone?

189
00:12:22,341 --> 00:12:25,083
- What about the bouquet?
- I'll arrange it, Edathi (sister-in-law)

190
00:12:28,547 --> 00:12:29,753
<i>demon?</i>

191
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:45,368
Can't you hear me?

192
00:12:45,898 --> 00:12:48,742
- Don't you have range?
- Yes, edathi! Very good range!

193
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:52,116
But since I've been roaming here
since morning, battery is quite low.

194
00:12:52,805 --> 00:12:53,840
But now it's charged.

195
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,118
Fully charged!

196
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:57,053
<i>My dear demon,</i>

197
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:59,055
I understood what your
battery charging is!

198
00:13:00,146 --> 00:13:02,524
But your father <i>&</i> brother are
going out of control here!

199
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:04,984
Enough of battery charging.
Come back fast!

200
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,184
I'll be right there!

201
00:13:06,185 --> 00:13:07,186
Don't cut the call!

202
00:13:07,253 --> 00:13:10,234
I have sent a list of emergency items
on WhatsApp. Buy them as well.

203
00:13:10,322 --> 00:13:13,391
And Tessa asked you to get some fresh
Jasmine flowers. Don't forget that.

204
00:13:13,392 --> 00:13:14,769
No. I won't forget.

205
00:13:16,395 --> 00:13:17,840
Bro, is there an ATM close by?

206
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:19,205
There's one right here.

207
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:25,114
Don't move!

208
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:26,249
Hands up!

209
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:28,249
If you try to escape, I'll shoot you!

210
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:29,318
Move!

211
00:13:34,046 --> 00:13:35,024
Dude, my hand!

212
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:38,085
<i>Demon, ifs me'. Mushtaq'.!</i>

213
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:39,552
Your old friend!

214
00:13:39,952 --> 00:13:41,932
Now you've started
looting people?

215
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:44,228
I was just trying to shock
you with a surprise entry!

216
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:45,460
This is how you shock me?

217
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:48,092
- Someone told me that you were in Dubai?
- Why Dubai?

218
00:13:48,093 --> 00:13:49,333
India is incredible, man!

219
00:13:50,362 --> 00:13:52,103
- Did you eat something?
- No! - Then come!

220
00:13:52,364 --> 00:13:54,002
First food, then talk!
Come!

221
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,812
Get in. I have a car.

222
00:13:56,969 --> 00:13:58,209
- Is this your car?
- Yea.

223
00:13:58,270 --> 00:13:59,408
Sheesh!

224
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:01,075
Get into my car.

225
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,914
- BMW?
- Yeah!

226
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:05,586
- How did this happen?
- It's a big story, man! Get in!

227
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:08,018
You go.
I'll follow you.

228
00:14:12,484 --> 00:14:13,462
Leave all that.

229
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:18,259
I know that there was no genie who made
you turn into a rich man one fine morning!

230
00:14:18,991 --> 00:14:20,527
Tell me your story, Mushtaq!

231
00:14:22,127 --> 00:14:23,401
Then I'll tell you the truth.

232
00:14:23,662 --> 00:14:26,074
When I cried <i>&</i> pleaded, mom
gave me some gold jewellery.

233
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:29,938
When I sincerely begged my brothers in
Dubai, they also gave me some money.

234
00:14:30,236 --> 00:14:32,113
With that money, I boarded
a bus to Tiruppur.

235
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,319
That was my beginning.

236
00:14:36,575 --> 00:14:38,248
Now I'm a textile exporter.

237
00:14:38,644 --> 00:14:41,420
People with brains needn't
cross the seas to make money.

238
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:43,322
You can join me if you want to.

239
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:45,155
We'll grow together, man!

240
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:47,089
Get some money from your dad!

241
00:14:47,152 --> 00:14:48,597
Ya right!
From my dad?

242
00:14:49,288 --> 00:14:51,234
He thinks I'm still a
little Dennis The Menace!

243
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:53,024
I was just saying.

244
00:14:53,025 --> 00:14:55,904
If you get hold of some cash
someday, come straight to Tiruppur.

245
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:05,978
- Happy?
- Thank you, Sir!

246
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:12,677
It's a great feeling to see happiness on
poor people's faces because of us, right?

247
00:15:12,678 --> 00:15:13,656
Yea rig ht!

248
00:15:14,513 --> 00:15:17,084
Sorry! Did I make you upset by
telling you my success story?

249
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:19,088
Why would I be upset?

250
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:24,122
- The food was awesome!
- You liked it?

251
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:25,625
I didn't expect to
see you here at all!

252
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,341
- It's so late?
- What happened?

253
00:15:32,631 --> 00:15:34,076
It's my sister's
wedding tomorrow.

254
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,034
Dad will kill me!

255
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:39,209
You're being so irresponsible <i>&</i> getting
drunk right before your sister's wedding?

256
00:15:39,371 --> 00:15:40,907
So sad!
Grow up, man!

257
00:15:41,573 --> 00:15:42,608
One slap I'll give you!

258
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:44,951
Then I'm also coming for
your sistefs wedding. Come!

259
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:52,592
Dude, money is like a vampiress
waiting to drink your blood!

260
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:56,325
In spite of knowing that she's
dangerous, we'll go behind her.

261
00:15:57,256 --> 00:15:58,701
We'll never feel that
we don't want it!

262
00:15:59,558 --> 00:16:02,293
But I've kept a limit
for money <i>&</i> wealth.

263
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:03,272
Why?

264
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:06,639
I have to buy a small island for
myself in some foreign country.

265
00:16:07,566 --> 00:16:09,102
Then, a small private jet.

266
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:12,545
A small account in some Swiss bank.

267
00:16:14,239 --> 00:16:16,150
And a net profit of a
billion dollars as well!

268
00:16:16,408 --> 00:16:17,546
That's all!
That's all I want!

269
00:16:18,243 --> 00:16:20,086
If I have more than that,
I'll become arrogant.

270
00:16:21,547 --> 00:16:23,686
This is what's
called simplicity!

271
00:16:24,049 --> 00:16:25,756
- You'll rock!
- I know, man!

272
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:28,190
I'm on the way to my dream, dude.

273
00:16:31,023 --> 00:16:32,001
Dude, police!

274
00:16:32,591 --> 00:16:34,264
Will there be a problem
since we're drunk?

275
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,561
Don't worry, man!

276
00:16:35,627 --> 00:16:37,607
It's Tamil Nadu, rig ht?
I will handle them.

277
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:39,008
Let's see!

278
00:16:47,106 --> 00:16:49,017
What is it, Sir? Have
you had alcohol?

279
00:16:49,575 --> 00:16:50,576
Please blow into this.

280
00:16:57,149 --> 00:16:59,060
Action here and
sound over there?

281
00:16:59,585 --> 00:17:01,223
Blow properly, Sir.
No cheating!

282
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:08,037
Get down.

283
00:17:18,303 --> 00:17:20,681
Is my brother-in-law
Jomon always like this?

284
00:17:21,073 --> 00:17:22,108
No!

285
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:27,241
He said that he got held up when he had to
hospitalize his friend, when he called.

286
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:28,524
Still,

287
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:31,686
if he hasn't turned up for
his own sistefs wedding...

288
00:17:42,528 --> 00:17:43,506
Hold this!

289
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:47,810
Aliya!

290
00:17:50,702 --> 00:17:51,680
What?

291
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:58,115
When we took a family photo after
the wedding, only you were missing!

292
00:17:58,177 --> 00:18:00,248
My dear Tessa, that's what
Photoshop is for, right?

293
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:03,881
Anyway, when your children see
your wedding album in the future,

294
00:18:03,882 --> 00:18:05,793
their uncle shouldn't be missing!

295
00:18:09,221 --> 00:18:10,199
Smile, dear!

296
00:18:13,492 --> 00:18:14,470
$0, good night!

297
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:48,137
Dad!

298
00:18:48,694 --> 00:18:49,832
Still, I love you!

299
00:18:50,562 --> 00:18:51,632
Stop there, you!

300
00:19:05,744 --> 00:19:08,247
Hey Jomon, what happened yesterday?

301
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:09,413
What?

302
00:19:09,414 --> 00:19:11,360
I didn't see you for your
own sister's wedding!

303
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:14,260
Shouldn't a brother have some
responsibility, my dear Jomon?

304
00:19:14,553 --> 00:19:17,193
If their newspapers are late, people
will say the same to you too!

305
00:19:17,256 --> 00:19:20,430
So go supply the rest of the
papers with responsibility!

306
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,326
Advice!

307
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:23,806
What's wrong in what he said?

308
00:19:23,862 --> 00:19:25,637
You don't have any responsibility...

309
00:19:25,964 --> 00:19:29,267
If you had the same responsibility
while you were studying for pre-degree,

310
00:19:29,268 --> 00:19:31,407
dad wouldn't have had to go
all the way to Karnataka,

311
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:33,848
and get you a payment seat
for MBBS by paying 70 Iakhs!

312
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:37,249
And now, you're sitting in your
father-in-law's cut-throat hospital

313
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:39,289
<i>&</i> doing real estate, right?
Leave me alone, bro!

314
00:19:40,812 --> 00:19:41,790
<i>G“ may» Son'.!</i>

315
00:19:43,315 --> 00:19:44,555
You're still alive?

316
00:19:46,318 --> 00:19:47,296
By the way.

317
00:19:47,419 --> 00:19:48,397
<i>Demon'.!</i>

318
00:19:48,453 --> 00:19:49,625
About responsibility, right?

319
00:19:49,755 --> 00:19:50,961
Yes. How did you know?

320
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,568
The first sight I saw when I woke
up today was responsibility!

321
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:55,171
Okay then Aliya!

322
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:56,994
Here you go, Joshichetta!

323
00:19:56,995 --> 00:20:00,464
Aliya, Jeslie told me that you aren't going
to the hospital. I'm taking your car.

324
00:20:00,465 --> 00:20:02,300
- My car has gone for servicing.
- Why not?

325
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:04,281
Just fill up the petrol
tank while coming back!

326
00:20:04,469 --> 00:20:05,469
Best family!

327
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:08,673
Joshichetta, the kids have to be
vaccinated today. When will you be back?

328
00:20:08,674 --> 00:20:10,585
You go with Jomon.
He's jobless, right?

329
00:20:10,642 --> 00:20:11,643
I'm not jobless.

330
00:20:11,977 --> 00:20:13,422
I have many things to do!

331
00:20:13,845 --> 00:20:15,449
- What do you have to do?
- Well..

332
00:20:16,515 --> 00:20:18,495
Preparations.
For my exam"

333
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:19,628
That's all, right?

334
00:20:19,685 --> 00:20:21,819
You leave! I'll go with
him to the hospital.

335
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:22,798
Okay!

336
00:20:23,622 --> 00:20:25,489
He's the only one who's
there when needed!

337
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:27,697
I'll get ready quickly. By
then, finish your work!

338
00:20:27,859 --> 00:20:28,837
But..

339
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,501
Bro, why didn't you come for
your sister's wedding yesterday?

340
00:20:37,502 --> 00:20:38,674
This is not right!

341
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:41,315
If you've come to work
here from Nepal, do that!

342
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,811
If you try to advice me,
I'll smash your head!

343
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:45,750
Understood?
Go do your work!

344
00:20:46,445 --> 00:20:48,322
- Shameless! Fool!
- What is this, Sir'?

345
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,558
Idiot!

346
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:54,697
Hey.

347
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:57,232
You're the only one who
cares for me in this house.

348
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:00,396
At least you haven't advised
me about responsibility!

349
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:06,405
Thank you! I'm content now!

350
00:21:12,537 --> 00:21:15,017
Jeslie's rounds must be over.
We can see her now. Come!

351
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:17,853
<i>Hey La“!</i>

352
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:20,578
Roselin? When did she
come back from Kuwait?

353
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:22,480
Hold her! I'll just meet
Roselin <i>&</i> come back!

354
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:23,892
- Which Roselin?
- She's my old friend!

355
00:21:24,016 --> 00:21:25,750
You do one thing. Take
the kids to Jeslie.

356
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:27,585
- She'll take care of the rest.
- Me alone?

357
00:21:27,586 --> 00:21:29,293
Go, dear!
Just go! It's okay!

358
00:21:32,891 --> 00:21:33,869
Come!

359
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:35,037
Give me your hand!

360
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:38,007
Look!

361
00:21:41,433 --> 00:21:42,411
<i>Demon?</i>

362
00:21:42,868 --> 00:21:44,313
Did you get married?

363
00:21:44,836 --> 00:21:46,338
Yes. It was yesterday.

364
00:21:46,738 --> 00:21:47,978
By sunrise, I had
two kids as well!

365
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,485
Why? Do you have a problem?

366
00:21:50,409 --> 00:21:51,820
She wants to know
if I'm married!

367
00:21:51,877 --> 00:21:53,083
What all do they want!

368
00:21:53,912 --> 00:21:55,913
And where's Chechi (sister) now?
- I don't know!

369
00:21:55,914 --> 00:21:57,587
She's babbling to some
female over there.

370
00:21:58,083 --> 00:21:59,289
Take the kids.

371
00:21:59,418 --> 00:22:01,398
They'll take care
of the vaccination.

372
00:22:01,687 --> 00:22:02,665
Go, dear.

373
00:22:03,588 --> 00:22:05,795
During the rounds,
Daddy was asking about you.

374
00:22:05,857 --> 00:22:07,734
Again, about you missing
your sister's wedding.

375
00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:08,859
Gosh!

376
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:10,806
I don't thinkl can bear
that torture as well.

377
00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:12,596
Let me escape before
he comes here.

378
00:22:12,597 --> 00:22:14,474
When Chechi comes, tell
her I'll be in the car.

379
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:17,479
OOPs!

380
00:22:21,373 --> 00:22:22,852
Let it be!

381
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:25,048
Why are you like this, Jomon?

382
00:22:26,611 --> 00:22:28,716
He is the third among
Vincent's children.

383
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:29,758
Eldest is Lali.

384
00:22:29,981 --> 00:22:31,949
Her husband is a
chartered accountant.

385
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:33,751
His practice is going very well!

386
00:22:33,752 --> 00:22:34,890
Second one..

387
00:22:34,986 --> 00:22:37,091
Yea.. Her husband Alphonse.
You know him, right?

388
00:22:37,489 --> 00:22:39,935
It was his younger sister
Tessa's wedding yesterday.

389
00:22:39,991 --> 00:22:41,470
The groom is an engineer,

390
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:44,598
has his own construction
com pany <i>&</i> is well-settled.

391
00:22:45,464 --> 00:22:49,105
And this guy has been roaming around
in his car saying that he's doing his MBA.

392
00:22:50,001 --> 00:22:51,936
And his MBA is a special MBA.

393
00:22:51,937 --> 00:22:53,883
Even after 5 years,
it's still not over.

394
00:22:54,639 --> 00:22:55,617
Uncle,

395
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:57,709
- I wanted to tell you something.
- What?

396
00:22:57,776 --> 00:23:01,087
When my friend's father
had a cardiac check-up,

397
00:23:01,146 --> 00:23:02,680
they found two major blocks.

398
00:23:02,681 --> 00:23:04,888
I think he needs Angioplasty!

399
00:23:06,518 --> 00:23:07,496
So...

400
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:09,998
Come!

401
00:23:11,857 --> 00:23:14,725
How is your friend's family?
Are they financially sound?

402
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:16,137
Yes. Cash is not an issue.

403
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:18,473
Refer this hospital to them.

404
00:23:18,697 --> 00:23:21,699
If they go to some other hospital,
they'll insert cheap stents.

405
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:24,180
And in matters of the heart,
we shouldn't take risks.

406
00:23:24,436 --> 00:23:25,414
Understood?

407
00:23:25,604 --> 00:23:27,641
It's a matter of pride!

408
00:23:27,773 --> 00:23:30,811
So we'll get expensive imported stents.
What say?

409
00:23:30,876 --> 00:23:32,977
Great! Then I'll ask them
to come here itself, uncle!

410
00:23:32,978 --> 00:23:34,787
Of course! I'll take
care of everything.

411
00:23:35,714 --> 00:23:37,853
Okay then Edathi! I'll be in the car.
Just tell Chechi.

412
00:23:41,052 --> 00:23:43,032
Even though he's a
little mischievous,

413
00:23:43,121 --> 00:23:44,725
there are some benefits like this.

414
00:23:44,856 --> 00:23:45,891
My dear daddy!

415
00:23:45,957 --> 00:23:48,096
Don't be such a cut-throat businessman!

416
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:51,568
You go on with your Pain <i>&</i>
Palliative and charity work!

417
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:56,170
I'm worried that you might turn this
hospital I made into some charity hospital!

418
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:57,868
Yes. That's exactly my plan!

419
00:23:57,869 --> 00:24:00,638
At least then, it'll be a penance
for all the sins you're doing now!

420
00:24:00,639 --> 00:24:02,540
What's going on between
daddy <i>&</i> daughter?

421
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:05,681
Alphie, I'm going to write
this hospital in your name!

422
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:08,917
This son of Vincent will never
forget how to do business!

423
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:09,947
<i>Great'.!</i>

424
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:12,155
Anyway, father-in-law <i>&</i>
son-in-law are a perfect match!

425
00:24:22,194 --> 00:24:25,437
Among the total 60, 42 are sold out.

426
00:24:25,864 --> 00:24:28,933
If we hold the remaining 18, we can
sell them for a higher price later.

427
00:24:28,934 --> 00:24:30,538
- Hold them then.
- Okay Sir.

428
00:24:31,503 --> 00:24:33,504
- Isn't that Nepali boy back yet?
- No.

429
00:24:33,505 --> 00:24:34,483
Why Sir?

430
00:24:34,539 --> 00:24:35,847
I had sent him to
buy cigarettes.

431
00:24:37,175 --> 00:24:38,153
Over here.

432
00:24:41,546 --> 00:24:42,854
Call me if something comes up.

433
00:24:42,914 --> 00:24:46,157
I went to the textiles shop <i>&</i> transport
office and you weren't there anywhere.

434
00:24:46,218 --> 00:24:47,885
At least pick up the
phone when I call!

435
00:24:47,886 --> 00:24:50,127
I wouldn't have heard it because
of the noise here, Ravunni.

436
00:24:50,188 --> 00:24:51,929
Anyway, good that you came.
Get in.

437
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:53,168
Vincent Sir,

438
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:56,131
Sir, here are your cigarettes.

439
00:24:56,962 --> 00:24:59,465
(in Tamil) I asked you
to get '555' cigarettes!

440
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:01,265
Why are you like this, Koirala?

441
00:25:01,266 --> 00:25:03,267
Sir, these are the foreign
cigarettes they had.

442
00:25:03,268 --> 00:25:05,771
If I say '555', you
should buy '555'.

443
00:25:06,104 --> 00:25:07,845
These Nepalis don't
know Malayalam.

444
00:25:07,906 --> 00:25:09,510
But Nepalis know
Tamil very well!

445
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:10,652
That's also true!

446
00:25:11,076 --> 00:25:12,646
Go! Go!

447
00:25:12,744 --> 00:25:14,155
- Okay Sir.
- Come!

448
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:19,525
Cigarette means '555'.

449
00:25:19,818 --> 00:25:22,162
Nothing else gives
that good feeling!

450
00:25:22,754 --> 00:25:25,735
Vincent, since when did you
start seeing this '555'?

451
00:25:26,658 --> 00:25:30,868
Long ago, we used to search for thrown
away beedi stubs without anyone seeing,

452
00:25:30,929 --> 00:25:34,900
and share it among ourselves. Have you
totally forgotten those days, buddy?

453
00:25:35,166 --> 00:25:38,306
You still smoke beedis because
you still remember all that!

454
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:41,512
Buddy, if you have money, you
should live accordingly!

455
00:25:43,742 --> 00:25:45,976
I don't understand
your money philosophy.

456
00:25:45,977 --> 00:25:47,285
I don't want to, either.

457
00:25:47,746 --> 00:25:49,282
I don't have a wife
or family anyway!

458
00:25:49,814 --> 00:25:52,317
I'll always be happy
being your shadow.

459
00:25:52,617 --> 00:25:54,618
There's only one
person in this world

460
00:25:54,619 --> 00:25:56,326
who has the right to address
Vincent as 'buddy'.

461
00:25:56,621 --> 00:25:57,929
And you want to be my shadow?

462
00:25:58,123 --> 00:25:59,796
You don't have to
be so humble!

463
00:26:00,625 --> 00:26:04,004
Buddy, I'm losing my sleep because you're
making me responsible for all these things.

464
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:07,073
See! It's the advance for the property
we sold in Ollur in this sack.

465
00:26:07,198 --> 00:26:10,034
Since morning, I've been restless
like I have ants in my pants,

466
00:26:10,035 --> 00:26:12,276
to hand it over to you!

467
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:13,549
Hold this.

468
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:16,719
The internal conflict
of a brooding Benami!

469
00:26:17,809 --> 00:26:20,289
It's all a joke for you!
I'm burning inside!

470
00:26:21,046 --> 00:26:22,753
Why are you scared, Ravunni?

471
00:26:22,948 --> 00:26:25,155
We are doing legitimate
business, right?

472
00:26:27,686 --> 00:26:28,858
Isn't that Palodan?

473
00:26:36,061 --> 00:26:37,665
- Hey!
- What is it, Aliya?

474
00:26:38,063 --> 00:26:41,365
Haven't you given a token advance for
the 10 acres of field at Puzhakkal?

475
00:26:41,366 --> 00:26:42,868
That old man is dead!

476
00:26:43,969 --> 00:26:45,971
His only son has
come from America.

477
00:26:46,037 --> 00:26:48,176
And he's not at all interested
in selling the property.

478
00:26:48,239 --> 00:26:50,845
And he's going back day after!
What do we do now?

479
00:26:53,011 --> 00:26:55,389
- When is the funeral?
- 3 PM today.

480
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,920
What can we do now..

481
00:26:57,215 --> 00:26:58,819
Get into the car.
We'll go there.

482
00:26:58,984 --> 00:27:00,691
- What did you say?
- Get into the car!

483
00:27:03,888 --> 00:27:06,061
Dasa, we have to buy
a wreath on the way.

484
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:09,872
Puzhakkal project is
my dream project.

485
00:27:10,061 --> 00:27:11,062
I can't let it go!

486
00:27:11,162 --> 00:27:13,764
Are you going to do real estate
business at a dead man's house?

487
00:27:13,765 --> 00:27:16,041
Not that. While
offering condolences,

488
00:27:16,101 --> 00:27:17,205
let me try my luck!

489
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:22,183
Someone has said that there's no right
or wrong time for doing business!

490
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:23,619
Philosophy?

491
00:27:36,788 --> 00:27:38,893
The one who's standing there
is his son from America.

492
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:40,966
- That bald-head?
- Yes.

493
00:28:07,085 --> 00:28:09,395
I'll serve the drinks.
It's okay. You can go, dear.

494
00:28:10,422 --> 00:28:11,924
- Cool drinks?
- No.

495
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:17,434
- Give it to me.
- I'll serve it.

496
00:28:18,329 --> 00:28:19,307
Father, drinks.

497
00:28:21,132 --> 00:28:22,110
For you, Jose?

498
00:28:27,005 --> 00:28:28,951
- Hold this.
- What is this for?

499
00:28:33,978 --> 00:28:34,956
Brother!

500
00:28:35,847 --> 00:28:36,825
Don't be sad.

501
00:28:37,115 --> 00:28:38,958
You should face
everything bravely!

502
00:28:40,085 --> 00:28:43,464
Usually, it's the neighbours who do all
that's needed, when there's a death.

503
00:28:43,521 --> 00:28:47,298
But we're doing this because you wouldn't
know your neighbours here, David.

504
00:28:48,993 --> 00:28:51,064
I'm a businessman.
Vincent Group of Companies.

505
00:28:53,932 --> 00:28:56,879
Thomas Chettan, who left us
today, was like a father to me.

506
00:28:58,069 --> 00:28:59,912
My father's name was not Thomas.

507
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:01,216
His name was Joseph.

508
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:08,414
Since he was like a father,
I rarely called his name.

509
00:29:09,347 --> 00:29:11,181
Did you have any business
deal with dad?

510
00:29:11,182 --> 00:29:12,160
No!

511
00:29:12,484 --> 00:29:15,055
It's not right to say
this in such a situation.

512
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:19,022
I had paid a token advance to
your dad on an agreement by word,

513
00:29:19,023 --> 00:29:20,502
for that property at Puzhakkal.

514
00:29:21,893 --> 00:29:22,926
How much was the advance?

515
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:25,203
Hey, I had paid only
Rs.1 Iakh as a token.

516
00:29:25,497 --> 00:29:28,876
We were about to verify the rest of the
documents and sign the agreements.

517
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:31,076
That's when your father"

518
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:33,244
One minute.
I'll just come.

519
00:29:36,975 --> 00:29:37,953
What is this?

520
00:29:41,346 --> 00:29:43,485
Whose name should I write on the cheque?
Or you need a cash cheque?

521
00:29:43,548 --> 00:29:45,015
No. We didn't come for that!

522
00:29:45,016 --> 00:29:46,518
Since you are the legal heir,

523
00:29:46,584 --> 00:29:48,791
we should be signing the
agreements with you, right?

524
00:29:48,853 --> 00:29:50,161
We came to talk about that.

525
00:29:52,524 --> 00:29:55,368
I've written a cash cheque. I'm not
interested in selling the property.

526
00:29:56,995 --> 00:29:58,395
If you had some courtesy,

527
00:29:58,396 --> 00:30:00,967
you wouldn't have come to do
business on the day my dad died!

528
00:30:01,032 --> 00:30:02,065
Oh no!

529
00:30:02,066 --> 00:30:05,013
Since you are a busy man and since
we heard you're going back tomorrow,

530
00:30:05,069 --> 00:30:07,208
we just cleared our side.
That's all!

531
00:30:16,948 --> 00:30:19,519
This is what happens if you try
to make bets in a burning house!

532
00:30:20,018 --> 00:30:21,224
<i>I had already warned you!</i>

533
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,497
Why are you still waiting here?

534
00:30:23,855 --> 00:30:25,528
Let me finish smoking this!

535
00:30:26,124 --> 00:30:28,392
And didn't you hear a 'Just
a minute' when we left? - Ya.

536
00:30:28,393 --> 00:30:31,101
From the tone of her voice, I
simply have a small hunch that

537
00:30:31,196 --> 00:30:33,335
that lady is one who
decides things for David.

538
00:30:33,398 --> 00:30:34,968
Don't have such hunches!

539
00:30:35,033 --> 00:30:36,533
We're lucky that
he didn't slap us!

540
00:30:36,534 --> 00:30:38,377
At times, calculations
can go wrong, Aliya!

541
00:30:38,436 --> 00:30:40,245
We'll try some other option.
Come!

542
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:41,983
Okay!

543
00:30:45,944 --> 00:30:47,480
Didn't you hear that?
'Just a minute!'.

544
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,282
Actually, that property
is not 10 acres.

545
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:52,555
There's 25 acres.

546
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:54,330
If you want to buy it as whole,

547
00:30:54,452 --> 00:30:55,430
I'm ready!

548
00:30:58,456 --> 00:31:02,927
It is indeed disrespectful to have come
for business on the day your father died.

549
00:31:03,294 --> 00:31:05,365
But, business is like a war.

550
00:31:05,964 --> 00:31:08,205
Decisions can be as
worthy as one's life!

551
00:31:08,499 --> 00:31:10,501
So they have to be taken
at the right time!

552
00:31:10,969 --> 00:31:12,949
Ravunni, give him that sack.

553
00:31:13,438 --> 00:31:15,850
Will we be able to handle
25 acres together'?

554
00:31:16,274 --> 00:31:17,252
We will manage.

555
00:31:22,113 --> 00:31:23,148
There's 50 Iakhs in this.

556
00:31:23,448 --> 00:31:26,588
When we sign the agreement tomorrow
morning, I'll pay some more as advance.

557
00:31:26,684 --> 00:31:28,960
And after four months, registration!

558
00:31:33,992 --> 00:31:36,598
- Don't you want a receipt for this?
- No. I trust you!

559
00:31:41,466 --> 00:31:44,003
Vincent, hats off to you!

560
00:31:48,673 --> 00:31:50,240
- Namaste!
- Namaste!

561
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:53,085
Till noon, at this textile shop. After
noon, at the bus service office.

562
00:31:53,144 --> 00:31:55,245
- Anto said that's your routine.
- That's my routine.

563
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:56,418
Tell me the matter.

564
00:31:56,481 --> 00:32:00,183
We're thinking of making the Chirakkalloor
temple festival grander this year.

565
00:32:00,184 --> 00:32:02,019
Make it grander! Why not?

566
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:05,001
We have sponsors for
Panchavadyam <i>&</i> music concerts.

567
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:07,291
And the sponsorship for the
elephants is in the process.

568
00:32:07,292 --> 00:32:08,532
And we have fireworks as well!

569
00:32:08,626 --> 00:32:11,004
Whatever you're interested
in, we can fix that!

570
00:32:11,696 --> 00:32:13,107
- Sit down!
- Okay!

571
00:32:13,698 --> 00:32:16,144
I've always been scared
of elephants <i>&</i> fireworks.

572
00:32:16,634 --> 00:32:18,368
Torturing poor animals,

573
00:32:18,369 --> 00:32:20,246
people getting killed
during fireworks..

574
00:32:20,305 --> 00:32:22,683
I believe that no God
will like all this.

575
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:26,944
But I give an amount for the Chirakkalloor
festival every year, right? - Yes.

576
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:28,356
You can get that without fail.

577
00:32:29,047 --> 00:32:32,256
In return, you have to keep a flex of our
shop at the festival ground as well.

578
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:33,590
That's usual, right?

579
00:32:33,685 --> 00:32:35,562
If you become the main
sponsor this year,

580
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,020
not just the shop's,

581
00:32:37,021 --> 00:32:39,092
we can keep an awesome
flex of yours as well!

582
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:40,498
A flex with best wishes from you!

583
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:42,225
We'll have some
secularism as well!

584
00:32:42,226 --> 00:32:44,228
There are some restless
millionaires in our city,

585
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:47,631
who are worried that they are not being
respected in spite of having a lot of money

586
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:51,045
and end up spending money
trying to gain that respect.

587
00:32:51,102 --> 00:32:52,080
Yes!

588
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:54,013
But this Vincent does not
have any such worries!

589
00:32:54,072 --> 00:32:55,050
You don't?

590
00:32:55,106 --> 00:32:58,349
I am not a Pranchiyettan!
And I don't need any Padmasree!

591
00:32:59,544 --> 00:33:01,080
Anto, give him the usual.

592
00:33:01,546 --> 00:33:03,992
Don't forget to keep the
shop's flex on the field!

593
00:33:04,115 --> 00:33:05,219
Take it from him.

594
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:07,257
He's quite difficult, man!

595
00:33:08,052 --> 00:33:09,586
Dad, fast! Fast!
Brisk walk!

596
00:33:09,587 --> 00:33:11,225
- I'm walking!
- Now try this!

597
00:33:11,456 --> 00:33:14,062
Football players do this!
Slow walk <i>&</i> stretch.

598
00:33:14,258 --> 00:33:15,498
. Me?
' Why not?

599
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:18,006
- What will people think if they see?
- Do it, dad!

600
00:33:22,033 --> 00:33:24,240
If you walk like this, your
cholesterol won't come down.

601
00:33:24,302 --> 00:33:25,440
Your body needs activity!

602
00:33:25,703 --> 00:33:27,614
Look!
We'll do a leg stretch.

603
00:33:28,272 --> 00:33:29,580
- Leg stretch?
- Hold it!

604
00:33:30,308 --> 00:33:31,286
The other leg.

605
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:36,257
Get lost!

606
00:33:36,748 --> 00:33:38,284
This is enough for
the inaugural day.

607
00:33:38,383 --> 00:33:40,488
The body might get confused
if I do unfamiliar stuff!

608
00:33:40,551 --> 00:33:41,529
What confusion?

609
00:33:41,652 --> 00:33:43,689
- Don't be so irresponsible, dad!
- Irresponsible?

610
00:33:44,155 --> 00:33:45,361
Look who's talking!

611
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:48,026
I have some responsibility,
at least about your health.

612
00:33:48,292 --> 00:33:50,329
Love for your father
is flowing abundantly!

613
00:33:50,595 --> 00:33:52,233
- What do you want?
- What?

614
00:33:52,663 --> 00:33:56,440
Dad, you will realize someday that the
love I have for you is like 916 gold.

615
00:33:56,567 --> 00:33:58,513
Stop over-acting and
tell me the matter!

616
00:34:03,174 --> 00:34:04,346
When did she come?

617
00:34:10,848 --> 00:34:13,116
- You're Vincent Sir, right?
- Yes.

618
00:34:13,117 --> 00:34:15,119
I'm a regular customer
at your shop.

619
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:16,286
- Is it?
- Yes.

620
00:34:16,287 --> 00:34:17,287
What do you do?

621
00:34:17,288 --> 00:34:20,098
I'm a teacher. Which school
are your kids studying in?

622
00:34:20,258 --> 00:34:21,658
Kids.. Well..

623
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:23,229
Devamatha is a good school!

624
00:34:23,494 --> 00:34:25,462
Enough of resting!
Come!

625
00:34:25,463 --> 00:34:26,806
Is he your brother, Sir'?

626
00:34:27,365 --> 00:34:29,299
I'm third one among this
Sir's four children.

627
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:31,246
He has two grandchildren as well!

628
00:34:31,302 --> 00:34:32,508
I had an early marriage!

629
00:34:35,606 --> 00:34:37,142
Early marriage?
Come!

630
00:34:38,342 --> 00:34:39,787
- Why are you jealous?
- Ya right!

631
00:34:41,312 --> 00:34:45,454
It's true that I miss your mom
when pretty girls sit next to me.

632
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:47,818
But even though it's been
24 years since she died,

633
00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:50,857
your dad didn't marry again
because he has great will-power!

634
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:55,166
So if a girl smiles at me,
nothing more will happen!

635
00:34:55,226 --> 00:34:57,527
Then why did you hold your breath
& pull your tummy inside?

636
00:34:57,528 --> 00:34:58,632
- When?
- I saw that!

637
00:34:58,696 --> 00:34:59,674
Hey Vincent!

638
00:35:01,799 --> 00:35:04,245
- You didn't recognize me?
- No. - I am Mariyamma!

639
00:35:05,136 --> 00:35:07,207
TC Mariyamma, who studied
with you in school!

640
00:35:08,873 --> 00:35:10,682
You're still quite glamourous!

641
00:35:10,808 --> 00:35:13,577
And I'm having a tough time
with so many diseases!

642
00:35:13,578 --> 00:35:14,878
What happened to your leg?

643
00:35:14,879 --> 00:35:16,722
That's because of my age.
What else?

644
00:35:16,814 --> 00:35:17,814
Then,

645
00:35:17,815 --> 00:35:19,351
what else is happening?

646
00:35:19,417 --> 00:35:20,817
Do you see other schoolmates?

647
00:35:20,818 --> 00:35:22,525
Ya. Some are still alive.

648
00:35:22,587 --> 00:35:24,294
Sebastian died last year.

649
00:35:24,655 --> 00:35:26,430
Which one? That policeman's
son Sebastian?

650
00:35:26,491 --> 00:35:27,469
Yes. The same!

651
00:35:27,558 --> 00:35:28,558
How?

652
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:30,436
Won't people die
after a certain age?

653
00:35:32,563 --> 00:35:34,898
It's been 2 years since
Rajappan <i>&</i> Claramma died.

654
00:35:34,899 --> 00:35:37,140
Who knows if it's
me or you next?

655
00:35:37,201 --> 00:35:38,839
Talk about yourself only!
Okay then!

656
00:35:38,903 --> 00:35:40,314
Hey! Why are you in such a hurry?

657
00:35:40,404 --> 00:35:42,475
- Let us talk for sometime!
- I am in a hurry!

658
00:35:42,573 --> 00:35:43,813
Then I'll come home.

659
00:35:43,875 --> 00:35:46,219
I'm going for a tour. I'll
come back only after 6 months!

660
00:35:47,278 --> 00:35:48,450
Don't laugh too much!

661
00:35:48,913 --> 00:35:51,189
So don't you miss mom when
you saw this classmate?

662
00:35:51,249 --> 00:35:53,855
Yes. I do miss.
But not your mom, my mom!

663
00:36:06,764 --> 00:36:07,742
Dad,

664
00:36:07,798 --> 00:36:10,301
a friend of mine asked the
same question that girl asked,

665
00:36:10,401 --> 00:36:11,846
when he saw you with me.

666
00:36:11,903 --> 00:36:12,881
What question?

667
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:14,441
Whether we are brothers.

668
00:36:14,972 --> 00:36:16,645
Actually, isn't that
how it looks like?

669
00:36:17,575 --> 00:36:19,248
Aren't you an
evergreen hero, dad?

670
00:36:22,413 --> 00:36:23,448
<i>Demon, my dear son...</i>

671
00:36:23,581 --> 00:36:24,719
come to the point.

672
00:36:24,982 --> 00:36:27,394
I was thinking about
the petrol prices.

673
00:36:27,752 --> 00:36:29,819
Since I'm running
around for everything,

674
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:32,266
how much money is spent on
petrol for this car in a day?

675
00:36:32,456 --> 00:36:34,458
You're worried that you're
wasting your dad's money!

676
00:36:34,592 --> 00:36:36,265
You can either walk
or take a bus!

677
00:36:36,627 --> 00:36:37,605
Not that.

678
00:36:37,795 --> 00:36:38,796
If I had a bike,

679
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:40,638
that would be enough
for these small trips.

680
00:36:40,798 --> 00:36:41,798
Bike?

681
00:36:41,799 --> 00:36:43,540
No need of bikes! They're risky!

682
00:36:43,834 --> 00:36:45,468
I mean.. the petrol prices..

683
00:36:45,469 --> 00:36:47,574
I'll bear that.
Anyway, no need of a bike!

684
00:36:59,283 --> 00:37:00,227
Give it here!

685
00:37:00,284 --> 00:37:02,286
- I'll give it, Chetta!
- You don't have to!

686
00:37:02,486 --> 00:37:03,464
I'll give it!

687
00:37:03,688 --> 00:37:05,292
You heard me?
Koirala!

688
00:37:15,766 --> 00:37:18,542
- If my mom was alive..
- Then she would've ironed my shirt!

689
00:37:18,603 --> 00:37:19,581
What else?

690
00:37:20,338 --> 00:37:21,316
Not that.

691
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:23,650
I wouldn't have had to
beg you for a bike!

692
00:37:24,308 --> 00:37:26,584
You haven't left it yet?
I forgot about it immediately!

693
00:37:27,445 --> 00:37:29,823
After my studies, when I'm
doing well, you will wish that.

694
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,223
What will I wish for?

695
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:34,658
You will wish that I came to you and
begged for something that I need!

696
00:37:35,052 --> 00:37:37,498
I don't think I would
have that good fortune!

697
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:41,665
Son, bikes are dangerous!

698
00:37:45,496 --> 00:37:47,476
Okay! Now don't make a
fuss for not having one!

699
00:37:47,531 --> 00:37:49,374
But ride carefully,
wearing a helmet!

700
00:37:50,501 --> 00:37:51,741
- Thank you dad!
- Slowly!

701
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:56,008
You know Palakkal Sunny, right?
The bike dealer.

702
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:57,585
Go there <i>&</i> buy it!

703
00:38:00,911 --> 00:38:02,322
- What?
- Cash.

704
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,823
I won't give the
cash in your hand!

705
00:38:04,649 --> 00:38:06,458
Ask them to send the
bill to my office.

706
00:38:06,584 --> 00:38:07,824
I'll call Sunny &tell him.

707
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,295
- Isn't that enough?
- That's enough!

708
00:38:11,389 --> 00:38:13,062
In that case, I can
get a good brand.

709
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,600
- Dad!
- What is it?

710
00:38:17,728 --> 00:38:19,708
You are the best dad in this world!

711
00:38:20,031 --> 00:38:21,408
Get lost, you donkey!

712
00:38:26,704 --> 00:38:30,584
- 25,000 <i>+</i> 30,000 +..
- Sir!

713
00:38:33,077 --> 00:38:35,717
George, how much does
a bike cost these days?

714
00:38:35,913 --> 00:38:38,715
If it's an ordinary bike, it
would come up to 60 or 70,000.

715
00:38:38,716 --> 00:38:41,451
If it's a Bullet, it would
be above 1-1.5 Iakhs.

716
00:38:41,452 --> 00:38:42,430
Gosh!

717
00:38:42,753 --> 00:38:44,754
Will he go get a Bullet now?

718
00:38:44,755 --> 00:38:46,756
Aren't you not in this world, Sir?

719
00:38:46,757 --> 00:38:49,670
Here. This is the bill that came
from Palakkal Sunny Sifs office.

720
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:57,813
Rs.18 Iakhs for one bike?

721
00:39:38,976 --> 00:39:40,580
How is it, dad?
Superb, right?

722
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:44,919
And like you, I won't waste
money on number plates.

723
00:39:45,116 --> 00:39:47,153
<i>Why do we need other
numbers when we 'naveyau'!?</i>

724
00:39:47,451 --> 00:39:49,829
Who gave you permission to
buy a bike for 18 Iakhs?

725
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:50,865
Don't say that, dad!

726
00:39:51,455 --> 00:39:53,401
Didn't I tell you that
I'll buy a good one?

727
00:39:53,457 --> 00:39:55,095
Good one means a
bike worth 18 Iakhs?

728
00:39:55,426 --> 00:39:56,404
Dad,

729
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:57,996
don't you say this
even in your sleep,

730
00:39:58,062 --> 00:39:59,763
that one should always
have some dignity!

731
00:39:59,764 --> 00:40:01,675
You drive a Mercedez
for that dignity, right?

732
00:40:01,799 --> 00:40:03,472
If that father's son
drives a normal bike,

733
00:40:03,534 --> 00:40:05,034
it's your dignity
that gets damaged!

734
00:40:05,035 --> 00:40:07,174
I will never do anything that
damages my dad's dignity!

735
00:40:07,438 --> 00:40:08,883
Please don't force me!
Very sorry!

736
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:11,508
Since he has bought a
bike for 18 Iakhs,

737
00:40:11,509 --> 00:40:12,920
I'll take his car, dad.

738
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:14,681
The dignity would be
balanced only then.

739
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:17,817
Dad, when you write your will, reduce the
price of this dignity from his share!

740
00:40:17,882 --> 00:40:20,692
When he got you married, he didn't
make any compromises on dignity!

741
00:40:21,185 --> 00:40:22,485
And when he gets me married,

742
00:40:22,486 --> 00:40:24,466
he will make sure he gets
back much more dignity!

743
00:40:24,622 --> 00:40:26,568
- Right, dad?
- There's no point blaming you!

744
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:29,033
When God gives us all
the prosperities,

745
00:40:29,126 --> 00:40:32,039
he also gives one such nuisance
to ward off evil eyes!

746
00:40:33,798 --> 00:40:36,005
I'm stopping this fooling-around
of yours from today!

747
00:40:36,534 --> 00:40:38,673
Now I'm going to make
some decisions for you.

748
00:40:38,969 --> 00:40:41,006
And you will obey me.
Understood? - Ya.

749
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:44,449
From tomorrow, you will take the
responsibility of the bus service.

750
00:40:45,709 --> 00:40:48,155
You should go to the office and
look into all the matters there.

751
00:40:48,646 --> 00:40:51,855
Only after you bring me all the accounts
<i>&</i> collections of every bus in the night,

752
00:40:51,916 --> 00:40:54,089
and verify it with me in person,

753
00:40:54,185 --> 00:40:55,220
<i>I will</i> let you sleep!

754
00:40:55,586 --> 00:40:56,690
Understood, you donkey?

755
00:40:57,054 --> 00:40:58,692
But dad" my exam!

756
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:00,567
The preparations for that.

757
00:41:00,624 --> 00:41:02,103
This is his only
answer to everything!

758
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:04,260
You've been doing your
preparations for ages, right?

759
00:41:04,261 --> 00:41:06,741
- From now on, listen to what dad says!
- Okay, brother!

760
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:10,111
Dad,

761
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:13,040
Still I love you!

762
00:41:23,614 --> 00:41:24,922
Get in, get in!!

763
00:41:25,049 --> 00:41:28,155
- Trip to Thriprayar <i>&</i> Cherpu.
- Brother, please move.

764
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:31,254
Sister, make some space.
Hey dear, get in fast.

765
00:41:31,255 --> 00:41:32,598
Please make some space.

766
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:33,768
Stand closer.

767
00:41:47,304 --> 00:41:48,282
Boss's son!

768
00:41:48,572 --> 00:41:50,051
If everyone's on
board, we can leave!

769
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:58,782
Please move. Didn't you see
that the boss is here?

770
00:41:58,883 --> 00:42:00,123
Boss, how come you're here?

771
00:42:00,217 --> 00:42:01,525
Don't call me boss.

772
00:42:01,619 --> 00:42:02,652
I'm a socialist.

773
00:42:02,653 --> 00:42:05,288
Jomon T Vincent.
Of this Vincent Motors.. That's right!

774
00:42:05,289 --> 00:42:06,267
Go do your job!

775
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:07,524
- Okay!
- Hey!

776
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:08,526
I'll ring the bell!

777
00:42:08,626 --> 00:42:09,764
Aww! He is so simple!

778
00:42:10,294 --> 00:42:11,272
Okay! Let's go!

779
00:42:13,731 --> 00:42:16,610
- Will you be coming tomorrow as well?
- I'll be coming daily hereafter.

780
00:42:16,667 --> 00:42:18,146
- What's your name?
- Athira.

781
00:42:18,903 --> 00:42:21,213
<i>- What was your name again?
- demon T Vincent'.!</i>

782
00:42:21,572 --> 00:42:22,642
Nice specs!

783
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:24,276
- You're quite smart!
- Thank you!

784
00:42:26,577 --> 00:42:28,022
Which college are you
guys studying in?

785
00:42:38,622 --> 00:42:40,033
- When do we meet again?
- Tomorrow!

786
00:42:40,624 --> 00:42:41,602
Okay then!

787
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:47,708
Brother!

788
00:42:48,299 --> 00:42:49,277
Give it to me!

789
00:42:50,301 --> 00:42:52,178
- I'll do it!
- What's the need for all that?

790
00:42:52,303 --> 00:42:54,146
- It's been my long time desire.
- I'll do it!

791
00:42:54,204 --> 00:42:55,274
Give me the money!

792
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:58,314
- You can take rest, brother.
- Give a ticket here.

793
00:43:04,381 --> 00:43:05,359
Isabella?

794
00:43:05,649 --> 00:43:06,649
Nice!

795
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:08,152
- Hey, can I take a selfie?
- Sure!

796
00:43:12,222 --> 00:43:13,200
Gosh!

797
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:17,871
Brother, go easy on those brakes!

798
00:43:19,229 --> 00:43:20,333
- Try asking him.

799
00:43:20,664 --> 00:43:21,642
- Shall I ask?

800
00:43:22,032 --> 00:43:23,875
- Can you give me your number?
- Why not?

801
00:43:34,411 --> 00:43:35,389
Palodan uncle!

802
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:46,968
Here's the umbrella.

803
00:43:47,057 --> 00:43:49,092
It's not raining, right? Why
do we need an umbrella?

804
00:43:49,093 --> 00:43:51,160
Hey, put the cash
inside the umbrella.

805
00:43:51,161 --> 00:43:53,971
We have no idea how many
cameras are around us now.

806
00:43:54,999 --> 00:43:56,945
Idiot who doesn't know
how to pay bribes.

807
00:43:57,801 --> 00:44:00,645
So yea. This is the
license for your shop.

808
00:44:00,971 --> 00:44:03,679
So, you haven't seen me
and I haven't seen you!

809
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:37,918
Hold on tight!

810
00:44:45,149 --> 00:44:46,127
Loudenloudefl

811
00:44:47,751 --> 00:44:48,889
Look who's driving!

812
00:44:53,757 --> 00:44:55,236
Hold on tight!

813
00:44:56,126 --> 00:44:57,764
Don't fall!
Hold on!

814
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:03,978
Move, you!

815
00:45:18,782 --> 00:45:19,760
Come down!

816
00:45:29,326 --> 00:45:31,127
- What's your name?
- Jomon.

817
00:45:31,128 --> 00:45:32,106
Vincent motors.

818
00:45:32,162 --> 00:45:34,039
- Are you the driver'?
- Driver is inside, sir.

819
00:45:40,170 --> 00:45:42,810
Look at him!
So innocent!

820
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:44,907
He should've been
behind bars for this!

821
00:45:44,908 --> 00:45:46,979
He drove a bus without a
heavy vehicle license!

822
00:45:47,377 --> 00:45:49,948
You're lucky that this poor
thing is the Mayor here.

823
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:52,381
I had to pull a lot of
strings in that care/of,

824
00:45:52,382 --> 00:45:54,384
to get him out without being
charged for this case.

825
00:45:54,885 --> 00:45:57,053
If I had done this
for someone else,

826
00:45:57,054 --> 00:45:59,898
I could've counted minimum
Rs.1 Iakh on my machine!

827
00:45:59,957 --> 00:46:01,334
- Right?
- Of course!

828
00:46:01,792 --> 00:46:04,033
What do I do with this
trouble-maker, Aliya?

829
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:06,095
What do I say, Aliya?

830
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:08,770
Uncle, we can be relieved that
he's out of the bus driving case.

831
00:46:08,832 --> 00:46:09,932
Dad, look at this.

832
00:46:09,933 --> 00:46:13,369
A girl in the bus, took a selfie with him
<i>&</i> has posted it on Facebook already!

833
00:46:13,370 --> 00:46:16,317
Not just one. 3-4 other girls
have also posted on Facebook.

834
00:46:16,373 --> 00:46:17,351
See..

835
00:46:17,407 --> 00:46:19,216
'With my cute friend Jomon.'

836
00:46:19,343 --> 00:46:21,050
Sheesh! I'm fed
up of these fans!

837
00:46:21,245 --> 00:46:22,485
- Let me see!
- Saw that?

838
00:46:22,913 --> 00:46:25,325
In between all this, he wants
to check out his fans!

839
00:46:25,415 --> 00:46:27,083
You know what should
be done for this?

840
00:46:27,084 --> 00:46:30,293
Hold his face tight and scrub it
right <i>&</i> left on an unfinished wall!

841
00:46:30,354 --> 00:46:32,300
But are there
unfinished walls here?

842
00:46:32,890 --> 00:46:34,335
Oh my God!

843
00:46:34,491 --> 00:46:38,166
Why did you get this dim-witted
sister of yours married to me?

844
00:46:38,395 --> 00:46:39,499
Let that be.

845
00:46:39,797 --> 00:46:41,538
Tell me what I should do with him!

846
00:46:41,899 --> 00:46:43,065
It's nothing else!

847
00:46:43,066 --> 00:46:45,512
He's going wayward because
he is not god-fearing.

848
00:46:45,602 --> 00:46:46,580
That's correct!

849
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:48,947
How long has it been since
you went to Church?

850
00:46:49,006 --> 00:46:49,984
You forgot?

851
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:52,179
Didn't we go to the Church
together last Christmas?

852
00:46:52,242 --> 00:46:53,220
Last Christmas?

853
00:46:53,577 --> 00:46:55,386
It's been one year since that.

854
00:46:55,445 --> 00:46:57,322
- This is the next Christmas.
- That's true.

855
00:46:57,381 --> 00:46:58,416
I'll tell you something.

856
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:02,491
Hereafter, you should go with them to
the Church every Sunday without fail.

857
00:47:03,253 --> 00:47:04,891
Give a proper confession,

858
00:47:04,988 --> 00:47:06,422
and wash off all your sins,

859
00:47:06,423 --> 00:47:08,096
and then come before me.

860
00:47:08,959 --> 00:47:10,597
- Dad!
- Don't say a word!

861
00:47:11,361 --> 00:47:14,171
After doing all sorts of nonsense,
finally there's that trick of yours!

862
00:47:14,231 --> 00:47:17,110
'Still I love you'. Go say that
somewhere else! Understood?

863
00:47:17,968 --> 00:47:19,242
Go to the Church first.

864
00:47:19,937 --> 00:47:23,009
Pray to God with all your heart
to show you the right path!

865
00:47:24,975 --> 00:47:28,277
He forgave our misgivings with his body,

866
00:47:28,278 --> 00:47:31,623
and cleansed the stains of
our sins with his blood..

867
00:47:31,982 --> 00:47:35,452
Glory be to our Jesus Christ.

868
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:36,497
Amen!

869
00:47:39,089 --> 00:47:41,290
Oh people blessed by the Lord,

870
00:47:41,291 --> 00:47:43,532
the sheep of His pasture,

871
00:47:43,627 --> 00:47:46,073
may His blessings shower upon you.

872
00:47:46,129 --> 00:47:47,107
Amen!

873
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:54,509
May the Lord shower his blessings
<i>&</i> compassion upon you.

874
00:47:55,138 --> 00:47:59,348
May His shetering right
hand protect you.

875
00:47:59,409 --> 00:48:03,323
- Now, always and forever.
- Amen!

876
00:48:03,413 --> 00:48:04,391
Amen!

877
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:17,934
I don't know why.

878
00:48:17,995 --> 00:48:21,169
After praying, I feel like all my sins
are cleansed <i>&</i> I am a new man now!

879
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:22,908
Don't you feel so?

880
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:24,378
Come. Let's go.

881
00:48:55,699 --> 00:48:57,337
There goes the new man!

882
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:31,946
I didn't know that
God is so loving!

883
00:49:33,236 --> 00:49:35,273
I should've turned to
spirituality much earlier!

884
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:40,042
Lord Christ is attracting
me like a magnetic force!

885
00:49:40,043 --> 00:49:42,080
That magnetic force's
name is Catherine.

886
00:49:43,013 --> 00:49:44,014
- Is it?
- Yes.

887
00:49:51,621 --> 00:49:52,599
Hey.

888
00:49:52,723 --> 00:49:55,704
You're trying to hit
on a huge shark's baby!

889
00:49:56,093 --> 00:49:57,071
Huge shark?

890
00:49:57,427 --> 00:49:59,566
You know Nancy Kurian, who
has businesses in Dubai?

891
00:49:59,629 --> 00:50:01,131
This Catherine is
her only daughter.

892
00:50:01,231 --> 00:50:02,335
- Really?
- Yes.

893
00:50:11,641 --> 00:50:13,279
It's actually a bumper lottery.

894
00:50:14,644 --> 00:50:15,748
If this happens.

895
00:50:15,812 --> 00:50:19,021
I'll quit all my corruption business,

896
00:50:19,082 --> 00:50:20,425
and join you as your manager.

897
00:50:21,051 --> 00:50:23,452
Since she is Nancy
Madam's only daughter,

898
00:50:23,453 --> 00:50:26,127
we will have to handle all
their wealth and property.

899
00:50:27,024 --> 00:50:29,004
My note-counting machine
will be working overtime!

900
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:33,007
Don't lessen her value by talking
only about her wealth, uncle!

901
00:50:33,463 --> 00:50:34,663
Then I'll do one thing.

902
00:50:34,664 --> 00:50:39,204
I'll find an angel-like girl from some
orphanage for you. Is that okay?

903
00:50:39,302 --> 00:50:40,280
Not like that.

904
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:42,016
Still"

905
00:50:42,072 --> 00:50:44,373
But that girl has to feel
something for him also, right?

906
00:50:44,374 --> 00:50:48,254
Usually when he sees girls, there's
this battery charging of his, right?

907
00:50:48,311 --> 00:50:49,688
None of that is
going to work here.

908
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:51,420
It needs precise planning.

909
00:50:51,515 --> 00:50:55,284
When she's in Thrisshur, she goes to our
Nimmychechi's beauty parlour regularly.

910
00:50:55,285 --> 00:50:56,263
La Fem me!

911
00:51:44,134 --> 00:51:45,204
What's your name?

912
00:51:45,302 --> 00:51:46,280
Catherine.

913
00:51:47,537 --> 00:51:48,515
I am Lali.

914
00:51:49,473 --> 00:51:50,781
Do you come here regularly?

915
00:51:51,208 --> 00:51:52,278
When I'm in town.

916
00:52:03,820 --> 00:52:04,855
What happened, Catherine?

917
00:52:05,555 --> 00:52:08,161
There's a car parked behind mine.
It's blocked.

918
00:52:08,325 --> 00:52:10,202
- I can't take my car out now.
- Oh gosh!

919
00:52:10,293 --> 00:52:11,567
What will you do now?

920
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:16,535
- See you then!
- Okay.

921
00:52:18,735 --> 00:52:20,903
Or else, you can get in.
We will drop you.

922
00:52:20,904 --> 00:52:24,173
It's okay, sister. I'll call a cab.
Or I'll ask them to send another car.

923
00:52:24,174 --> 00:52:26,677
That will take a long time.
Get in. We'll drop you!

924
00:52:36,586 --> 00:52:37,758
This is my brother.

925
00:52:56,273 --> 00:52:58,685
Oh no! I forgot to buy
baby food for my daughter.

926
00:52:58,842 --> 00:53:00,788
Can you please drop
me at Shobha mall?

927
00:53:00,977 --> 00:53:02,912
You can pick me up after
dropping her home.

928
00:53:02,913 --> 00:53:03,891
Okay chechi!

929
00:53:14,558 --> 00:53:15,866
You can sit in the front, dear.

930
00:53:15,926 --> 00:53:18,236
Why let Jomon complain that
you made him a driver?

931
00:53:22,732 --> 00:53:23,870
- Okay. Bye!

932
00:53:43,553 --> 00:53:44,623
At the Church, right?

933
00:53:45,021 --> 00:53:47,627
I didn't say that because I
wasn't sure if you had noticed.

934
00:53:49,326 --> 00:53:50,464
What are you doing now?

935
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:51,838
Nothing much.

936
00:53:52,262 --> 00:53:53,240
MBA is over..

937
00:53:53,296 --> 00:53:54,536
I mean getting over.

938
00:53:56,333 --> 00:53:57,812
Our family is also into business.

939
00:53:58,501 --> 00:53:59,844
I haven't been
involved in it yet.

940
00:54:00,837 --> 00:54:02,544
And for pocket money,

941
00:54:02,739 --> 00:54:05,743
I've started doing some e-commerce
and stock exchange investments.

942
00:54:06,009 --> 00:54:06,987
That's nice!

943
00:54:08,011 --> 00:54:10,287
Your family is a well known
business family here, right?

944
00:54:10,647 --> 00:54:11,625
Who told you?

945
00:54:11,815 --> 00:54:12,793
Your sister.

946
00:54:52,389 --> 00:54:53,367
So Palodan,

947
00:54:53,423 --> 00:54:56,558
our association members' flats
should be in the same block, okay?

948
00:54:56,559 --> 00:54:57,731
Why not?

949
00:54:57,894 --> 00:54:58,872
And yea.

950
00:54:58,928 --> 00:55:02,398
I'll get the advance money transferred
to your account next week itself.

951
00:55:03,633 --> 00:55:05,874
And ya, finish all the works on time!

952
00:55:06,536 --> 00:55:08,103
I have to go back to America!

953
00:55:08,104 --> 00:55:10,550
Consider it done! This is
our most prestigious project.

954
00:55:11,775 --> 00:55:12,753
Okay Palodan.

955
00:55:19,849 --> 00:55:23,387
30 flats were booked at
one go, because of me.

956
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:27,022
Even though there are no other benefits
from this expatriate association,

957
00:55:27,023 --> 00:55:28,661
sometimes they come
into use like this.

958
00:55:28,925 --> 00:55:30,426
- And one more thing.
- What?

959
00:55:30,427 --> 00:55:31,405
No!

960
00:55:31,594 --> 00:55:34,473
Already you are tensed about a 100 things.
I won't say it!

961
00:55:34,531 --> 00:55:36,098
- Tell me, Aliya!
- I won't!

962
00:55:36,099 --> 00:55:37,305
I said, tell me!

963
00:55:37,434 --> 00:55:38,412
Well..

964
00:55:38,468 --> 00:55:39,503
I am your brother-in law,

965
00:55:39,602 --> 00:55:40,910
So you must be
tensed thinking

966
00:55:41,004 --> 00:55:44,008
'how do I pay a commission to my
brother-in-law for bringing them

967
00:55:44,074 --> 00:55:46,418
and in case I pay him, will
he accept it?'. Right?

968
00:55:46,476 --> 00:55:49,616
I swear! I couldn't sleep all night
yesterday because of this tension.

969
00:55:49,713 --> 00:55:51,590
You will accept if I pay
you a commission, right?

970
00:55:51,681 --> 00:55:52,915
- Will you?
_ Yes!

971
00:55:52,916 --> 00:55:54,116
That tension is gone!

972
00:55:54,117 --> 00:55:56,018
Look at the guy who
doesn't take commissions!

973
00:55:56,019 --> 00:55:57,123
What did you say?

974
00:56:08,531 --> 00:56:10,033
This is the surprise
I told you about.

975
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:12,673
- You're going to wear those jeans?
- Not that!

976
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:15,145
I'm going to start this
shop in your name!

977
00:56:15,538 --> 00:56:17,609
I can't let you be
reckless anymore.

978
00:56:18,608 --> 00:56:19,916
Before starting
something in my name,

979
00:56:20,009 --> 00:56:21,777
Shouldn't you consider
my interest as well?

980
00:56:21,778 --> 00:56:23,052
Why are you not interested?

981
00:56:23,146 --> 00:56:24,625
Isn't this part of new-generation?

982
00:56:24,848 --> 00:56:25,986
And to assist you,

983
00:56:26,182 --> 00:56:28,492
I've brought Tony here
from our textiles shop.

984
00:56:28,752 --> 00:56:30,026
Not that.
My exams.

985
00:56:30,186 --> 00:56:31,563
And the preparations.

986
00:56:31,688 --> 00:56:33,489
I've seen enough of
your preparations.

987
00:56:33,490 --> 00:56:34,468
Enough of that!

988
00:56:34,524 --> 00:56:37,159
If you want, you can go to Coimbatore
to write the exam <i>&</i> come back!

989
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:38,730
Rest of the studies
you can do here!

990
00:56:39,896 --> 00:56:40,874
What happened?

991
00:56:41,765 --> 00:56:42,743
Nothing!

992
00:56:50,907 --> 00:56:52,181
- Tony,
- What?

993
00:56:52,442 --> 00:56:54,012
Don't you have any
ladies' items here?

994
00:56:54,944 --> 00:56:57,185
Your dad has asked us to
sell only gents' items!

995
00:56:58,014 --> 00:56:59,994
So I will have to go
outside to get charged!

996
00:57:00,683 --> 00:57:02,856
You could've kept at
least kids' items for sale.

997
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:05,098
Hey!

998
00:57:05,422 --> 00:57:08,460
If kids come here, their
moms would also come along.

999
00:57:08,525 --> 00:57:10,526
Then you'll lose your
concentration in business.

1000
00:57:10,527 --> 00:57:12,165
For the time being,
we need only gents!

1001
00:57:12,429 --> 00:57:13,407
Fine!

1002
00:57:43,259 --> 00:57:44,533
Shall we play doubles?

1003
00:57:47,764 --> 00:57:49,107
- Mixed doubles!
- Okay!

1004
00:58:39,315 --> 00:58:40,692
Whom do you like in Tennis?

1005
00:58:40,750 --> 00:58:41,750
In Tennis?

1006
00:58:41,751 --> 00:58:42,855
Whom do you like most?

1007
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:44,698
One second.

1008
00:58:47,023 --> 00:58:48,263
A message from the shop.

1009
00:58:59,969 --> 00:59:01,642
These business deals
come up in between.

1010
00:59:02,305 --> 00:59:04,873
In Tennis, I like Maria
Sharapova, Sania Mirza,

1011
00:59:04,874 --> 00:59:06,285
Britain's Laura Robson,

1012
00:59:06,809 --> 00:59:09,119
then Romania's Sorana Cirstea,

1013
00:59:09,913 --> 00:59:11,346
Russia's Maria Kirilenko.

1014
00:59:11,347 --> 00:59:12,587
All of them are great!

1015
00:59:14,217 --> 00:59:17,630
All the girls who play
tennis are really hot!

1016
00:59:18,688 --> 00:59:20,964
But if any of them had invited
me for a coffee like this,

1017
00:59:21,024 --> 00:59:22,128
I wouldn't have gone!

1018
00:59:22,926 --> 00:59:24,166
- Is it?
- I swear!

1019
00:59:24,827 --> 00:59:26,898
But when you said that
we'll have a coffee,

1020
00:59:27,730 --> 00:59:30,210
I can't figure out
what happened to me.

1021
00:59:33,369 --> 00:59:35,671
If I say something,
will you feel bad?

1022
00:59:35,672 --> 00:59:36,650
What?

1023
00:59:37,307 --> 00:59:38,843
Or leave it.
You'll feel bad.

1024
00:59:40,043 --> 00:59:41,613
Come on! Tell me what it is!

1025
00:59:44,213 --> 00:59:45,191
No!

1026
00:59:46,149 --> 00:59:47,355
Please. Tell me!

1027
00:59:48,151 --> 00:59:49,129
Nothing else,

1028
00:59:51,321 --> 00:59:53,301
You are so so..

1029
00:59:53,623 --> 00:59:54,601
Gorgeous!

1030
00:59:56,192 --> 00:59:58,172
See! I told you that
you'll feel bad!

1031
01:00:01,030 --> 01:00:02,134
I was just lying to you.

1032
01:00:02,231 --> 01:00:03,335
Don't take it seriously.

1033
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:05,006
You're not that gorgeous!

1034
01:00:39,402 --> 01:00:45,045
I kept on looking
and I kept on waiting,

1035
01:00:45,108 --> 01:00:50,108
To see how the white
flower blooms,

1036
01:00:50,813 --> 01:00:55,813
To see when the
white flower blooms!

1037
01:00:56,386 --> 01:01:02,132
I kept on looking
and I kept on waiting,

1038
01:01:02,325 --> 01:01:07,638
To see how the white
flower blooms,

1039
01:01:07,764 --> 01:01:12,679
To see when the
white flower blooms!

1040
01:01:13,336 --> 01:01:16,442
The southern winds do not know..

1041
01:01:16,673 --> 01:01:19,374
The spring flies do not know..

1042
01:01:19,375 --> 01:01:22,219
The friendly dove does not know..

1043
01:01:22,311 --> 01:01:24,120
No one knows about it!

1044
01:01:24,414 --> 01:01:30,228
I kept on looking
and I kept on waiting,

1045
01:01:30,286 --> 01:01:36,259
To see how the white
flower blooms,

1046
01:01:36,492 --> 01:01:41,407
To see when the
white flower blooms!

1047
01:02:09,792 --> 01:02:12,204
Is it when the night sleeps?

1048
01:02:12,261 --> 01:02:15,367
Or when the day descends
from its chariot?

1049
01:02:15,431 --> 01:02:22,747
Or when the jungle tree drips twilight
honey over the country roads?

1050
01:02:29,378 --> 01:02:35,056
When did it flower?
When did its petals bloom?

1051
01:02:35,184 --> 01:02:40,896
When did it flower?
When did its petals bloom?

1052
01:02:40,957 --> 01:02:44,962
When the banyan leaves and
bamboo shoots were silent,

1053
01:02:45,027 --> 01:02:47,963
sweet flower buds
bloomed in my mind,

1054
01:02:47,964 --> 01:02:50,376
they bloomed all over!

1055
01:02:50,433 --> 01:02:56,406
I kept on looking
and I kept on waiting...

1056
01:03:21,898 --> 01:03:27,371
Is it beneath the garland?
Or is it where the rain-flowers sprinkle?

1057
01:03:27,436 --> 01:03:32,784
Or is it at the branch where
the wild sparrow weaves its nest,

1058
01:03:32,842 --> 01:03:39,384
on the banks of the
cheerful stream.

1059
01:03:41,417 --> 01:03:46,366
Where did it flower?
Where did its petals bloom?

1060
01:03:46,422 --> 01:03:53,067
Where did it flower?
Where did its petals bloom?

1061
01:03:53,262 --> 01:03:57,176
Far away, where the peacock and the
cuckoo cannot reach,

1062
01:03:57,233 --> 01:03:59,804
the sweet little buds bloomed towards me,

1063
01:03:59,969 --> 01:04:01,949
they bloomed all over!

1064
01:04:02,572 --> 01:04:08,545
I kept on looking
and I kept on waiting,

1065
01:04:08,611 --> 01:04:13,924
To see how the white
flower blooms,

1066
01:04:13,983 --> 01:04:19,490
To see when the
white flower blooms!

1067
01:04:36,572 --> 01:04:39,018
- Dad, for me!!
- Come here!

1068
01:04:40,009 --> 01:04:41,215
For me too!

1069
01:04:41,944 --> 01:04:42,922
Dad, for me!

1070
01:04:46,949 --> 01:04:48,516
90..91..92..93..

1071
01:04:48,517 --> 01:04:50,394
93?
What are you doing?

1072
01:04:50,453 --> 01:04:51,989
I was just counting your age!

1073
01:04:52,288 --> 01:04:53,631
You don't have to
count all that!

1074
01:04:54,991 --> 01:04:56,061
What is he doing?

1075
01:04:56,125 --> 01:04:57,604
Looks like he's
about to wrestle!

1076
01:04:58,327 --> 01:04:59,305
Take it!

1077
01:04:59,362 --> 01:05:00,340
Enough. Ready!

1078
01:05:01,631 --> 01:05:02,905
'I Robot'.

1079
01:05:05,635 --> 01:05:06,668
It's a movie name.

1080
01:05:06,669 --> 01:05:07,670
Hey! Got the name, right?

1081
01:05:07,937 --> 01:05:09,245
Now make us guess it.

1082
01:05:09,338 --> 01:05:11,545
Don't make any noise.
Don't move your lips!

1083
01:05:12,541 --> 01:05:14,145
Bring out your talents!

1084
01:05:16,145 --> 01:05:17,123
You!

1085
01:05:19,048 --> 01:05:21,349
'Psycho'.
It's 'Psycho'.

1086
01:05:21,350 --> 01:05:22,328
No?

1087
01:05:26,122 --> 01:05:27,601
Dumb <i>&</i> Dumber!

1088
01:05:28,257 --> 01:05:30,237
You are ganging up against me!
I'm not playing!

1089
01:05:30,293 --> 01:05:32,273
It's such a happy occasion.
Don't make him upset!

1090
01:05:32,361 --> 01:05:33,361
Exactly!

1091
01:05:33,362 --> 01:05:35,603
Even though they're saying
the truth, don't be upset!

1092
01:05:36,198 --> 01:05:37,176
Get lost!

1093
01:05:37,366 --> 01:05:38,344
Okay brother.

1094
01:05:40,002 --> 01:05:41,504
Two words!

1095
01:05:43,439 --> 01:05:44,417
'Mr.Fraud'

1096
01:05:45,007 --> 01:05:46,077
That's rig ht!

1097
01:05:47,043 --> 01:05:48,021
I'll say!

1098
01:05:48,144 --> 01:05:49,145
'Prodigal Son'

1099
01:05:49,946 --> 01:05:51,016
That's correct!

1100
01:05:51,180 --> 01:05:53,524
- All of you play yourselves!
- Jomon! Hey!

1101
01:05:56,018 --> 01:05:57,497
This boy is the limit!

1102
01:05:58,387 --> 01:06:01,698
After starting the ready-made shop, I think
he has become little more responsible.

1103
01:06:02,024 --> 01:06:04,368
You don't have to worry
about him anymore.

1104
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:07,206
He will be the one who brings
a fortune to this family.

1105
01:06:07,263 --> 01:06:10,039
Why? Has he bought some Onam
bumper lottery ticket?

1106
01:06:10,099 --> 01:06:11,077
Not that, man!

1107
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:13,380
He has come across a treasure trove!

1108
01:06:13,736 --> 01:06:15,215
Did you know about it?

1109
01:06:15,404 --> 01:06:17,384
I heard them saying something.
Is it true?

1110
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:18,418
Of course!

1111
01:06:18,641 --> 01:06:21,554
Some of us playing a game
as backstage crew members.

1112
01:06:22,011 --> 01:06:24,379
Anyway, we've got the ball rolling.

1113
01:06:24,380 --> 01:06:26,223
Rest of it depends on our luck.

1114
01:06:26,415 --> 01:06:29,089
Anyway, I understood that
my children love me.

1115
01:06:30,119 --> 01:06:32,224
Today's party was fully
sponsored by my children.

1116
01:06:33,122 --> 01:06:34,601
Usually they ask money for everything.

1117
01:06:34,657 --> 01:06:36,637
But they didn't ask me for
a single rupee for this.

1118
01:06:36,692 --> 01:06:38,638
This time I'll win!

1119
01:06:39,562 --> 01:06:40,540
Play carefully!

1120
01:06:41,530 --> 01:06:43,441
- Then I'll cut it!
- Good move!

1121
01:06:44,667 --> 01:06:47,648
Hey, I've spent all the money
for dad's birthday party.

1122
01:06:47,803 --> 01:06:49,749
You would've kept precise
accounts for it, right?

1123
01:06:49,805 --> 01:06:50,805
That's rig ht!

1124
01:06:50,806 --> 01:06:53,787
And since this time he has a ready-made
shop, Jomon will also give his share.

1125
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:55,648
Don't bring more shame
to Trisshur Christians!

1126
01:06:55,711 --> 01:06:57,554
Tell me how much you spent.
I'll pay it fully!

1127
01:06:57,613 --> 01:06:59,447
You needn't show your
love for Dad all alone!

1128
01:06:59,448 --> 01:07:02,283
Already you're spending a lot of
money which belongs to all of us.

1129
01:07:02,284 --> 01:07:04,628
- That's correct!
- So just pay your share alone!

1130
01:07:04,787 --> 01:07:05,787
Play!

1131
01:07:05,788 --> 01:07:07,529
If you say this to
Dad, I'll kill you!

1132
01:07:07,690 --> 01:07:08,668
Kill me!

1133
01:07:13,729 --> 01:07:14,707
Ravunni,

1134
01:07:14,797 --> 01:07:16,208
Jomon's shop has clicked!

1135
01:07:16,399 --> 01:07:17,377
Saw the rush?

1136
01:07:18,167 --> 01:07:20,113
You should've done
this much earlier.

1137
01:07:20,436 --> 01:07:22,006
Come. Let's have a look inside.

1138
01:07:22,238 --> 01:07:23,376
I'll buy a shirt as well.

1139
01:07:23,439 --> 01:07:25,578
Let it be an
encouragement for him.

1140
01:07:29,745 --> 01:07:30,689
Okay.

1141
01:07:31,213 --> 01:07:32,191
Okay then.

1142
01:07:36,318 --> 01:07:37,296
Pack this one.

1143
01:07:37,820 --> 01:07:39,265
Ravunni, you also buy a shirt.

1144
01:07:39,455 --> 01:07:41,196
I don't like these
ready-m ad e stuff.

1145
01:07:42,658 --> 01:07:45,104
So come again next week.
Bring your parents as well.

1146
01:07:45,661 --> 01:07:46,639
Bye. Thank you.

1147
01:07:47,396 --> 01:07:48,396
That's 6114.

1148
01:07:48,397 --> 01:07:50,035
Tony, give me the bill for this.

1149
01:07:50,332 --> 01:07:51,470
I'll pay it right now.

1150
01:07:51,734 --> 01:07:54,169
Accounts should be proper
even between father <i>&</i> son!

1151
01:07:54,170 --> 01:07:55,649
Sir, you needn't pay for this.

1152
01:07:55,738 --> 01:07:57,672
Let this be a gift
for you from me.

1153
01:07:57,673 --> 01:07:59,152
A gift from you?

1154
01:07:59,475 --> 01:08:01,476
I worked with you for
some time, right?

1155
01:08:01,477 --> 01:08:02,455
That's why.

1156
01:08:03,212 --> 01:08:04,190
<i>Where is demon?</i>

1157
01:08:04,313 --> 01:08:05,792
Jomon doesn't come here now.

1158
01:08:05,881 --> 01:08:07,121
He doesn't come?

1159
01:08:07,616 --> 01:08:10,790
15 days back, Jomon
sold this shop to me.

1160
01:08:13,155 --> 01:08:14,293
He sold it to you?

1161
01:08:16,459 --> 01:08:17,665
How much was the price?

1162
01:08:18,194 --> 01:08:19,172
40 Iakhs!

1163
01:08:19,428 --> 01:08:20,406
For 40 Iakhs?

1164
01:08:22,198 --> 01:08:25,372
Didn't you know that I spent around
70 Iakhs to start this shop, Tony?

1165
01:08:27,136 --> 01:08:29,377
When you came before
me 8 years back,

1166
01:08:29,705 --> 01:08:31,548
there was some honesty
in your face.

1167
01:08:32,575 --> 01:08:34,282
I gave you a job seeing that.

1168
01:08:35,244 --> 01:08:36,222
But now..

1169
01:08:36,345 --> 01:08:37,345
In:

1170
01:08:37,346 --> 01:08:38,324
That"

1171
01:08:38,581 --> 01:08:39,559
<i>demon...</i>

1172
01:08:40,416 --> 01:08:42,555
When your customers
look at you r face,

1173
01:08:42,718 --> 01:08:44,425
don't tremble like this, Tony.

1174
01:08:45,154 --> 01:08:46,462
You will lose their trust.

1175
01:08:47,556 --> 01:08:48,864
Just keep that in mind.

1176
01:08:50,392 --> 01:08:52,099
Anyway, you are smart.

1177
01:08:53,195 --> 01:08:54,469
Let your business flourish.

1178
01:09:00,436 --> 01:09:01,574
Ungrateful scoundrel!

1179
01:09:10,613 --> 01:09:11,614
Stop it!

1180
01:09:11,947 --> 01:09:13,449
This is a stay order
from High Court

1181
01:09:13,549 --> 01:09:15,358
for encroaching fields
<i>&</i> doing construction.

1182
01:09:15,417 --> 01:09:17,920
You haven't got clearance from the
central ministry of environment.

1183
01:09:37,406 --> 01:09:38,407
Buddy,

1184
01:09:49,952 --> 01:09:50,930
Well..

1185
01:09:51,787 --> 01:09:55,360
It's just that our work is stuck
for the time-being, right?

1186
01:09:56,392 --> 01:09:57,769
We shall appeal to a higher court!

1187
01:09:58,260 --> 01:09:59,534
That won't happen quickly.

1188
01:09:59,662 --> 01:10:01,462
No! Needn't happen quickly!

1189
01:10:01,463 --> 01:10:02,737
It will happen gradually, right?

1190
01:10:02,965 --> 01:10:07,277
Until then, we will go forward
with the rest of our businesses.

1191
01:10:07,703 --> 01:10:10,309
I'm not tensed because the
construction was stopped. - Then?

1192
01:10:10,706 --> 01:10:12,652
That day, that
property from David"

1193
01:10:13,442 --> 01:10:15,786
When I had to buy 15
more acres urgently"

1194
01:10:16,478 --> 01:10:18,613
I had taken a loan
from that Swamy.

1195
01:10:18,614 --> 01:10:19,592
Okay.

1196
01:10:19,648 --> 01:10:21,958
You had told me that Swamy
helped you back then.

1197
01:10:22,851 --> 01:10:25,457
- Will Swamy help me for free, Ravunni?
- Then?

1198
01:10:26,388 --> 01:10:30,234
I know that Swamy charges
a heavy interest. But..

1199
01:10:31,894 --> 01:10:34,704
When more than half of the
project was sold in advance,

1200
01:10:35,464 --> 01:10:38,308
that confidence of mine which you
always talk about, went overboard!

1201
01:10:39,935 --> 01:10:42,470
Since I thought I'm rolling
that money for a short period,

1202
01:10:42,471 --> 01:10:44,644
Swamy gave me the money
only after I registered

1203
01:10:44,707 --> 01:10:46,983
all the collateral security
he asked for, in his name.

1204
01:10:48,277 --> 01:10:50,655
Textiles, transport
company, other properties,

1205
01:10:50,813 --> 01:10:51,791
and even,

1206
01:10:52,314 --> 01:10:54,021
everything else including
my own house <i>&</i> car,

1207
01:10:54,416 --> 01:10:55,883
is in Swamy's name now.

1208
01:10:55,884 --> 01:10:58,296
What nonsense have you done?

1209
01:10:59,255 --> 01:11:01,735
Couldn't you ask me once before
doing all this? At least to me?

1210
01:11:03,025 --> 01:11:04,868
I knew you would never allow me.

1211
01:11:05,928 --> 01:11:07,601
I didn't even talk to my children.

1212
01:11:16,005 --> 01:11:16,983
Move, I say!

1213
01:11:19,708 --> 01:11:21,654
- Where is he?
- Stop shouting!

1214
01:11:22,011 --> 01:11:23,888
I know your problems.

1215
01:11:24,580 --> 01:11:25,718
Give me my money!

1216
01:11:26,348 --> 01:11:28,453
I gave you money thinking
you were decent.

1217
01:11:28,517 --> 01:11:30,718
Your money is not lost!

1218
01:11:30,719 --> 01:11:33,087
I'm telling you! Listen to me!

1219
01:11:33,088 --> 01:11:34,658
Try to understand!

1220
01:11:34,857 --> 01:11:36,302
Your money is safe.

1221
01:11:36,425 --> 01:11:37,870
Stop shouting.
Move!

1222
01:11:38,460 --> 01:11:40,030
Pay us our money now!

1223
01:11:44,366 --> 01:11:45,367
Hey, stop there!

1224
01:11:45,434 --> 01:11:46,412
What is this?

1225
01:11:46,468 --> 01:11:47,742
Why are you taking Vincent, Sir?

1226
01:11:47,836 --> 01:11:50,438
Shouldn't we take action if he
cheats people by promising flats?

1227
01:11:50,439 --> 01:11:52,510
But you should be taking
action on its owner, right?

1228
01:11:52,875 --> 01:11:55,355
I'm Ravunni. Son of
Cheruparambil Madhavan.

1229
01:11:55,511 --> 01:11:57,923
That property is in my name.
I am the owner of that project.

1230
01:12:02,084 --> 01:12:03,084
<i>Hey Auto,</i>

1231
01:12:03,085 --> 01:12:04,996
show him those documents!

1232
01:12:15,464 --> 01:12:16,442
- Come!
- Sir!

1233
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:19,578
Ravunni!

1234
01:12:21,337 --> 01:12:22,407
You don't worry!

1235
01:12:22,638 --> 01:12:23,878
What if I'm behind bars,

1236
01:12:23,939 --> 01:12:25,418
you should be outside!

1237
01:12:25,541 --> 01:12:26,884
Only then, we can solve all this.

1238
01:12:26,942 --> 01:12:27,942
Be strong!

1239
01:12:27,943 --> 01:12:28,921
Let's go.

1240
01:13:17,593 --> 01:13:18,571
Who are you?

1241
01:13:23,665 --> 01:13:25,645
Didn't you recognize me, Vincent Sir'?

1242
01:13:27,469 --> 01:13:29,142
I am Swamy's manager.

1243
01:13:30,973 --> 01:13:31,951
Okay.

1244
01:13:35,511 --> 01:13:37,184
Swamy has told me specifically

1245
01:13:37,446 --> 01:13:39,983
that I should give you at least
one week to vacate the house.

1246
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:55,032
Tell Swamy that we will vacate
the house at the earliest.

1247
01:13:55,664 --> 01:13:57,507
- Shall I leave then?
- Okay.

1248
01:14:03,906 --> 01:14:04,884
Come here.

1249
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:06,018
Come!

1250
01:14:16,919 --> 01:14:17,919
Dad,

1251
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:20,867
when you took such a huge gamble,
couldn't you avoid this house at least!

1252
01:14:20,923 --> 01:14:22,732
All this happened
because of your greed!

1253
01:14:22,925 --> 01:14:24,700
Now all of us will suffer together.

1254
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:25,830
What else to do?

1255
01:14:57,860 --> 01:14:58,838
Dad!

1256
01:15:02,731 --> 01:15:04,540
I heard that you went
to write your exam.

1257
01:15:05,033 --> 01:15:06,011
How was it?

1258
01:15:06,869 --> 01:15:08,246
Will you pass at least this time?

1259
01:15:14,576 --> 01:15:16,613
I asked everyone else to leave.

1260
01:15:18,614 --> 01:15:19,854
While vacating the house,

1261
01:15:20,182 --> 01:15:21,889
a scene shouldn't be created.

1262
01:15:23,652 --> 01:15:24,630
Dad!

1263
01:15:25,320 --> 01:15:26,697
I came to take you.

1264
01:15:28,123 --> 01:15:29,101
Take me?

1265
01:15:29,224 --> 01:15:30,202
Where?

1266
01:15:31,293 --> 01:15:32,738
I'm not coming anywhere.

1267
01:15:37,032 --> 01:15:38,943
It's true that Vincent
has gone bankrupt.

1268
01:15:39,635 --> 01:15:40,841
But I will face it.

1269
01:15:41,637 --> 01:15:42,877
I will try to get it all back.

1270
01:15:43,739 --> 01:15:46,117
Instead, you want me to run <i>&</i> hide?

1271
01:15:46,775 --> 01:15:48,910
Dad, everyone knows that
Ravunni uncle is your benami

1272
01:15:48,911 --> 01:15:50,322
and that he has gone
to jail for you!

1273
01:15:50,946 --> 01:15:52,254
Will everything be
over with that?

1274
01:15:54,683 --> 01:15:57,630
We don't have any answer to give
the people who've invested money.

1275
01:15:57,686 --> 01:15:59,353
I haven't done anything
wrong to anyone.

1276
01:15:59,354 --> 01:16:00,765
I know that very well.

1277
01:16:01,089 --> 01:16:02,830
Only you <i>&</i> I would
understand that.

1278
01:16:03,358 --> 01:16:06,965
I won't let you stand helplessly
in front of violent people.

1279
01:16:11,667 --> 01:16:13,044
For the time being,
don't stay here.

1280
01:16:13,101 --> 01:16:14,307
We'll figure the rest later.

1281
01:16:14,870 --> 01:16:16,008
Listen to me, dad.

1282
01:16:35,324 --> 01:16:36,302
Come, dad.

1283
01:17:48,096 --> 01:17:50,337
Jomon had asked me not to
call you before you wake up.

1284
01:17:51,066 --> 01:17:52,739
- Where is he?
- He has gone out.

1285
01:17:52,934 --> 01:17:54,311
I've brought breakfast.

1286
01:17:54,403 --> 01:17:55,469
Freshen up, Sir.

1287
01:17:55,470 --> 01:17:56,972
We'll go meet Jomon after that.

1288
01:18:08,750 --> 01:18:09,728
Come, dad!

1289
01:18:22,397 --> 01:18:23,774
Sit on this chair, dad.

1290
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:25,778
Sit down, dad!

1291
01:18:28,403 --> 01:18:30,076
Mushtaq <i>&</i> I studied together.

1292
01:18:30,706 --> 01:18:31,878
Don't be fooled by his looks.

1293
01:18:32,074 --> 01:18:34,213
He finished textile engineering
<i>&</i> did an MBA as well.

1294
01:18:34,443 --> 01:18:35,922
He has actually passed MBA.

1295
01:18:36,144 --> 01:18:38,181
Now he has a textile exporting
business in Tiruppur.

1296
01:18:39,147 --> 01:18:41,315
With the money I got by
selling the bike <i>&</i> the shop,

1297
01:18:41,316 --> 01:18:42,294
I came here.

1298
01:18:43,251 --> 01:18:45,788
I invested it here and became
a partner in this company.

1299
01:19:00,368 --> 01:19:04,214
When we see the news about different
kinds of disasters on TV <i>&</i> newspapers,

1300
01:19:04,840 --> 01:19:05,978
we will curse God.

1301
01:19:07,843 --> 01:19:09,379
Earthquakes, wars,

1302
01:19:09,544 --> 01:19:10,522
tsunami,

1303
01:19:11,213 --> 01:19:12,954
so many people are dying.

1304
01:19:14,249 --> 01:19:17,355
An entire city can be
destroyed in one day.

1305
01:19:18,386 --> 01:19:19,386
But,

1306
01:19:19,387 --> 01:19:21,230
He would've left behind
at least a sapling,

1307
01:19:21,323 --> 01:19:23,234
to start from scratch
all over again!

1308
01:19:23,525 --> 01:19:24,503
Right, son?

1309
01:19:28,396 --> 01:19:30,967
Mushtaq, can I sit here
and smoke a cigarette?

1310
01:19:31,032 --> 01:19:32,010
Of course!

1311
01:19:41,910 --> 01:19:43,389
We have to set
everything right, dad!

1312
01:19:44,012 --> 01:19:46,219
Even though I invested, I
never used to come here.

1313
01:19:46,982 --> 01:19:48,962
Dad's Jomon won't be a
prodigal son anymore!

1314
01:19:50,352 --> 01:19:53,094
From tomorrow, I'll come to this
company regularly, to help him out.

1315
01:19:53,555 --> 01:19:55,000
- Right Mushtaq?
- Yes.

1316
01:19:55,056 --> 01:19:56,558
So I can also relax a bit.

1317
01:20:00,962 --> 01:20:01,940
God!

1318
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:05,904
Dad, I'm leaving!

1319
01:20:06,368 --> 01:20:07,346
Wait!

1320
01:20:10,205 --> 01:20:11,183
What is this?

1321
01:20:11,540 --> 01:20:13,076
From now on, don't
have hotel food.

1322
01:20:13,241 --> 01:20:14,879
I'm jobless here anyway.

1323
01:20:15,243 --> 01:20:17,553
I'll know today if should eat
daily from a hotel hereafter.

1324
01:20:18,013 --> 01:20:19,253
Try eating it first.

1325
01:20:19,948 --> 01:20:20,926
Okay dad.

1326
01:20:36,498 --> 01:20:37,476
I'll be inside.

1327
01:20:41,102 --> 01:20:42,809
So many clients?

1328
01:20:43,038 --> 01:20:44,574
They would've come to
give orders, right?

1329
01:20:44,973 --> 01:20:46,475
They are not our clients, Sir.

1330
01:20:46,541 --> 01:20:47,952
We are their client.

1331
01:20:49,878 --> 01:20:51,880
I'll call them.
Talk to them yourself.

1332
01:20:57,419 --> 01:20:58,397
Sit down.

1333
01:21:00,322 --> 01:21:02,495
I'm the manager of Atlas
tours <i>&</i> travels company.

1334
01:21:02,958 --> 01:21:06,269
The total due for Mushtaq Sir's travel
expenses has come up to 12 Iakhs, Sir.

1335
01:21:08,396 --> 01:21:10,130
I am the manager of Sundaram car finance.

1336
01:21:10,131 --> 01:21:12,499
For the past 3 months, we haven't
received any installments.

1337
01:21:12,500 --> 01:21:16,414
All the cheques your company gave us for
the materials supplied, have bounced, Sir.

1338
01:21:17,105 --> 01:21:18,639
Sir, I'll talk to my partner"

1339
01:21:18,640 --> 01:21:20,313
and settle everything
within next week.

1340
01:21:20,675 --> 01:21:22,086
Please come back next week.

1341
01:21:27,983 --> 01:21:30,964
He keeps going on world tours saying
that he's going to get orders.

1342
01:21:31,419 --> 01:21:33,194
He travels only in business class.

1343
01:21:33,655 --> 01:21:35,134
He stays only in star hotels.

1344
01:21:35,690 --> 01:21:37,363
He drives only expensive cars.

1345
01:21:37,659 --> 01:21:39,935
His life is in an imaginary world

1346
01:21:39,995 --> 01:21:42,168
which doesn't match with the
company's real situation.

1347
01:21:42,497 --> 01:21:44,477
He blew up all the money
that he brought.

1348
01:21:45,133 --> 01:21:47,204
That's when you came in
with a lot of money.

1349
01:21:47,936 --> 01:21:50,280
I am very sorry to say.
This is a sinking ship.

1350
01:21:52,374 --> 01:21:54,980
This is my last day
in this company, Sir.

1351
01:21:56,444 --> 01:21:57,980
My children are studying.

1352
01:21:58,179 --> 01:22:00,420
If I have to go forward, I
need to find another job.

1353
01:22:01,016 --> 01:22:03,997
Since you seem like an innocent chap,
I thought I'd warn you beforehand.

1354
01:22:33,415 --> 01:22:34,393
Stop there!

1355
01:22:36,685 --> 01:22:37,720
Fraud Mushtaq!

1356
01:22:40,121 --> 01:22:41,191
Stop there, you!

1357
01:23:11,052 --> 01:23:14,329
I knew all this would happen
someday or the other.

1358
01:23:16,524 --> 01:23:19,596
Even if I was in your place,
the same would've happened.

1359
01:23:20,128 --> 01:23:22,267
If you cry again,
I'll break your head!

1360
01:23:25,266 --> 01:23:27,041
I've lost even my last hope!

1361
01:23:27,635 --> 01:23:29,581
Poor dad! God, how do
I tell this to him?

1362
01:23:41,049 --> 01:23:42,027
Come.

1363
01:23:44,252 --> 01:23:46,129
- Why do you look tired?
- Nothing.

1364
01:23:46,654 --> 01:23:49,191
When you work for the first time
in life, this is how it is.

1365
01:23:49,524 --> 01:23:53,700
By the time you freshen up, hot 'Puttu' and
an awesome chicken curry will be ready!

1366
01:23:53,795 --> 01:23:54,773
<i>Great'.!</i>

1367
01:24:03,171 --> 01:24:05,014
Long back, when I used
to go for purchasing,

1368
01:24:05,073 --> 01:24:06,573
while we were staying
in a rented house,

1369
01:24:06,574 --> 01:24:09,453
I used to try out some recipes
which your mom wrote for me.

1370
01:24:09,577 --> 01:24:11,181
This is one of those items.
How is it?

1371
01:24:11,513 --> 01:24:12,617
My mom's recipe, right?

1372
01:24:13,181 --> 01:24:14,251
It's very MSW!

1373
01:24:14,682 --> 01:24:15,786
So your dad is out now?

1374
01:24:16,518 --> 01:24:19,089
Even though it's mom's screenplay,
you're the director, right?

1375
01:24:19,454 --> 01:24:20,432
It's awesome!

1376
01:24:22,357 --> 01:24:24,394
There aren't any good Malayali
hotels in Tiruppur.

1377
01:24:24,459 --> 01:24:25,659
Shall we try a hand at it?

1378
01:24:25,660 --> 01:24:27,196
As if everything
else wasn't enough!

1379
01:24:30,065 --> 01:24:31,043
<i>Demon,</i>

1380
01:24:31,132 --> 01:24:32,406
are you tensed about something?

1381
01:24:33,068 --> 01:24:34,046
No!

1382
01:24:34,536 --> 01:24:37,574
I just meant that we'll build what we
have now before starting something new.

1383
01:24:42,644 --> 01:24:44,123
I had called Alphie today.

1384
01:24:44,546 --> 01:24:46,146
Even though he's a miser,

1385
01:24:46,147 --> 01:24:49,458
he said that he <i>&</i> his brothers-in-law
will arrange the money to fight the case.

1386
01:24:50,685 --> 01:24:52,255
Ravunni is still in jail, right?

1387
01:24:52,687 --> 01:24:54,633
So you should go to
Thrisshur tomorrow.

1388
01:24:58,393 --> 01:24:59,371
Okay dad.

1389
01:24:59,494 --> 01:25:00,837
I got what you're saying.

1390
01:25:01,262 --> 01:25:04,675
We agreed to spend money for the case,
because that wealth belongs to us as well.

1391
01:25:04,799 --> 01:25:07,336
And not because we have any
sympathy for our greedy dad,

1392
01:25:07,435 --> 01:25:11,542
who gambled everything including
this house without telling anyone.

1393
01:25:12,874 --> 01:25:14,444
We had met the advocate yesterday.

1394
01:25:14,909 --> 01:25:16,479
He has agreed to plead the case.

1395
01:25:16,578 --> 01:25:17,852
We paid the advance immediately.

1396
01:25:18,279 --> 01:25:21,158
Rest of the money, we
will pay him directly.

1397
01:25:21,549 --> 01:25:23,250
That means that we don't trust you,

1398
01:25:23,251 --> 01:25:25,162
who sold the shop that dad
gave you <i>&</i> went away!

1399
01:25:25,220 --> 01:25:26,358
You don't have to trust me!

1400
01:25:26,788 --> 01:25:28,290
I don't need anyone's
money as well!

1401
01:25:28,723 --> 01:25:31,829
But this attitude of yours with which
you milk your patients for money,

1402
01:25:31,893 --> 01:25:33,861
you had to show that
towards our dad as well?

1403
01:25:33,862 --> 01:25:35,162
What did you say?

1404
01:25:35,163 --> 01:25:36,665
Who asked you to take
dad to Tamil Nadu?

1405
01:25:36,898 --> 01:25:38,206
All that's over, Chechi.

1406
01:25:38,266 --> 01:25:40,143
We should be thinking
what to do next.

1407
01:25:40,201 --> 01:25:41,179
You keep quiet.

1408
01:25:41,736 --> 01:25:43,113
Bring him back here.

1409
01:25:43,171 --> 01:25:44,650
We will look after
him until he dies.

1410
01:25:44,706 --> 01:25:46,708
You will look after him, chechi!
I know!

1411
01:25:47,242 --> 01:25:50,244
And you'll keep tabs of the food he had
and cigarettes he smoked in a book

1412
01:25:50,245 --> 01:25:51,349
and ask us to split it.

1413
01:25:51,446 --> 01:25:53,722
Finally when people come asking for
their money <i>&</i> he becomes a nuisance,

1414
01:25:53,781 --> 01:25:55,315
you'll send him to
some old age home.

1415
01:25:55,316 --> 01:25:57,626
And then you'll ask us to share
the money you spent for it!

1416
01:25:57,719 --> 01:25:58,719
<i>Demon'.!</i>

1417
01:25:58,720 --> 01:26:00,358
There's nothing wrong
in what she said.

1418
01:26:00,421 --> 01:26:02,697
Didn't dad ruin everything
he earned on his own?

1419
01:26:02,790 --> 01:26:04,394
He didn't ruin everything, Dr.Alphonse.

1420
01:26:05,326 --> 01:26:06,464
This Doctor status of yours,

1421
01:26:06,661 --> 01:26:08,698
and these well-settled
husbands of our sisters,

1422
01:26:09,264 --> 01:26:10,402
are our dad's earnings.

1423
01:26:11,266 --> 01:26:12,643
Those aren't ruined yet, right?

1424
01:26:13,868 --> 01:26:15,779
Only the money he spent
for me was wasted.

1425
01:26:17,605 --> 01:26:18,743
Among his children,

1426
01:26:18,806 --> 01:26:20,444
I am the only one
who is a waste.

1427
01:26:55,476 --> 01:26:56,810
How long have I
been calling you?

1428
01:26:56,811 --> 01:26:58,484
Why didn't you send
a message at least?

1429
01:27:06,254 --> 01:27:07,426
Some family issues.

1430
01:27:07,989 --> 01:27:09,468
I heard some of it too.

1431
01:27:09,657 --> 01:27:11,603
But why are you
ignoring me for that?

1432
01:27:11,659 --> 01:27:12,797
Where are you now?

1433
01:27:14,596 --> 01:27:15,574
lam..

1434
01:27:15,830 --> 01:27:17,309
I am in Thrisshur now.

1435
01:27:20,401 --> 01:27:21,379
Where?

1436
01:27:25,006 --> 01:27:26,340
I want to see you.

1437
01:27:26,341 --> 01:27:27,479
Where are you now?

1438
01:27:27,675 --> 01:27:28,710
I'll come there.

1439
01:27:29,010 --> 01:27:29,954
Now..

1440
01:27:31,346 --> 01:27:32,620
We needn't meet now, Catherine.

1441
01:27:32,714 --> 01:27:33,692
We have to!

1442
01:27:33,848 --> 01:27:35,225
Or else, you come here.

1443
01:27:35,483 --> 01:27:36,461
To my house.

1444
01:27:39,721 --> 01:27:40,699
I'll come.

1445
01:28:22,630 --> 01:28:23,836
Everything will be all right.

1446
01:28:52,493 --> 01:28:54,473
I have warned you many times.

1447
01:28:59,067 --> 01:29:03,709
The guy who marries Nancy Kurian's only
daughter needs to have some merits.

1448
01:29:04,772 --> 01:29:06,410
It's because you don't know him.

1449
01:29:06,607 --> 01:29:09,349
There will be many fair-skinned,
smart guys in town.

1450
01:29:09,444 --> 01:29:11,390
But there are many other
factors for a good match.

1451
01:29:11,446 --> 01:29:13,619
You don't have the maturity
to judge that yet.

1452
01:29:16,684 --> 01:29:17,662
Talk softly!

1453
01:29:17,819 --> 01:29:20,095
I will talk loudly in my house.
I don't care!

1454
01:29:20,855 --> 01:29:22,562
You know their
present situation?

1455
01:29:22,990 --> 01:29:26,767
Without even a house to sleep in, both
father <i>&</i> son are hiding somewhere!

1456
01:29:26,828 --> 01:29:29,138
They don't need you now.
They need your money!

1457
01:29:29,897 --> 01:29:32,104
It's pointless to shout at
me when you hear the truth.

1458
01:29:37,705 --> 01:29:39,150
Can I talk to Catherine
for a minute?

1459
01:29:41,175 --> 01:29:42,153
No madam!

1460
01:29:42,643 --> 01:29:43,917
I must interfere in this.

1461
01:29:52,186 --> 01:29:53,631
What your mom said is right.

1462
01:29:54,689 --> 01:29:55,997
For Nancy Kurian's daughter,

1463
01:29:56,891 --> 01:29:58,131
I am not a good match.

1464
01:30:04,465 --> 01:30:05,944
If this happened a
few days earlier,

1465
01:30:06,167 --> 01:30:07,874
I wouldn't have cared
about any of this.

1466
01:30:08,870 --> 01:30:09,848
But now..

1467
01:30:10,505 --> 01:30:12,781
I don't want to make
you also suffer,

1468
01:30:12,840 --> 01:30:14,911
along with so many problems
without any solution.

1469
01:30:16,778 --> 01:30:18,849
And I don't want to
solve my problems,

1470
01:30:19,180 --> 01:30:21,160
with the money I would
get by marrying you!

1471
01:30:36,697 --> 01:30:38,404
But we have to bear this pain.

1472
01:30:39,934 --> 01:30:40,912
Both of us.

1473
01:30:43,070 --> 01:30:44,413
After some time,

1474
01:30:44,872 --> 01:30:45,942
it will all be gone!

1475
01:31:03,491 --> 01:31:05,198
How many years has it
been since your marriage?

1476
01:31:05,460 --> 01:31:07,167
27-28 years.

1477
01:31:27,949 --> 01:31:29,189
Sister, give me
some butter-milk.

1478
01:31:30,485 --> 01:31:31,759
How come you're here, Sir?

1479
01:31:32,053 --> 01:31:33,220
I had an interview here.

1480
01:31:33,221 --> 01:31:34,199
Interview?

1481
01:31:34,255 --> 01:31:36,633
My dad doesn't know that
our company is shut.

1482
01:31:37,492 --> 01:31:39,733
Soto survive for the time
being, I must get a job!

1483
01:31:46,534 --> 01:31:47,534
Greetings Sir!

1484
01:31:47,535 --> 01:31:49,481
Son, he has told me
everything about you.

1485
01:31:49,537 --> 01:31:51,915
We have vacancy for
just one salesman post.

1486
01:31:52,073 --> 01:31:56,042
Your job will be to get orders
for the garments made here.

1487
01:31:56,043 --> 01:32:00,253
In your visiting card, you can be a
salesman or a supervisor. I don't care!

1488
01:32:00,314 --> 01:32:02,521
But this job is
very competitive.

1489
01:32:02,617 --> 01:32:03,857
You should work like cattle!

1490
01:32:05,219 --> 01:32:08,029
So you can join the job from
tomorrow morning! Okay?

1491
01:32:08,789 --> 01:32:10,063
Shall I go?
Bye!

1492
01:32:11,893 --> 01:32:12,871
Balettan!

1493
01:33:31,372 --> 01:33:32,874
- Hi Edathi!
- Jomon,

1494
01:33:33,374 --> 01:33:34,785
Dad is fine, right?

1495
01:33:35,876 --> 01:33:36,854
Yes.

1496
01:33:36,978 --> 01:33:38,980
I have a flat in my
name in Ernakulam.

1497
01:33:39,180 --> 01:33:41,023
You both can stay
there if you want to!

1498
01:33:41,382 --> 01:33:42,759
That won't be right, edathi.

1499
01:33:43,217 --> 01:33:45,163
Here, I can do any job
and no one will know.

1500
01:33:45,720 --> 01:33:47,063
Check your account.

1501
01:33:47,154 --> 01:33:48,724
I've sent some money.

1502
01:33:48,889 --> 01:33:49,959
Oh! That wasn't.

1503
01:33:50,057 --> 01:33:51,035
Was necessary!

1504
01:33:52,059 --> 01:33:53,037
Shut up!

1505
01:34:12,380 --> 01:34:13,358
<i>Demon'.!</i>

1506
01:34:13,881 --> 01:34:15,292
I heard that you got a job!

1507
01:34:15,950 --> 01:34:17,759
One job can't solve
all our problems.

1508
01:34:17,885 --> 01:34:19,386
But when have you
ever done a job?

1509
01:34:19,387 --> 01:34:20,627
That was earlier.

1510
01:34:20,821 --> 01:34:22,926
But now I've started a
small cottage industry.

1511
01:34:23,090 --> 01:34:25,764
A small business where I buy
some handicraft clothes

1512
01:34:25,826 --> 01:34:27,931
from the weavers' villages
and sell it to others.

1513
01:34:28,095 --> 01:34:30,735
Maybe because I was thulped badly.
I decided to be a good man!

1514
01:34:30,831 --> 01:34:31,831
Then do that!

1515
01:34:31,832 --> 01:34:33,933
- What should I do for that?
- You needn't do anything!

1516
01:34:33,934 --> 01:34:35,675
But you will be my
partner in that as well!

1517
01:34:36,103 --> 01:34:38,271
I don't want your partnership
or any of that bullshit!

1518
01:34:38,272 --> 01:34:41,048
You need it! And I don't need your
money or permission for that.

1519
01:34:43,911 --> 01:34:44,889
Mushtaq!

1520
01:34:58,959 --> 01:35:00,438
Do you have '555'
cigarettes here?

1521
01:35:00,761 --> 01:35:01,739
No Sir.

1522
01:35:01,796 --> 01:35:03,798
- Do you know where to get them?
- I don't know.

1523
01:35:08,269 --> 01:35:10,749
In the next street,
there's a duty free shop.

1524
01:35:10,805 --> 01:35:13,183
- You can buy it there if you want to!
- Is it? Where is it?

1525
01:35:13,274 --> 01:35:16,448
If you take that left
turn, there's a temple..

1526
01:35:16,777 --> 01:35:18,450
Near that.

1527
01:35:19,513 --> 01:35:22,187
- If you want, I'll show you the place.
- Thank you!

1528
01:35:23,484 --> 01:35:25,157
- Are you a Malayali?
- No!

1529
01:35:25,386 --> 01:35:28,856
My wife is from Palakkad. That's
why I know a little Malayalam.

1530
01:35:29,056 --> 01:35:30,296
But she's no more.

1531
01:35:30,391 --> 01:35:31,927
It's been 5 years since she died.

1532
01:35:31,992 --> 01:35:33,096
That's sad to hear.

1533
01:35:33,961 --> 01:35:35,372
- What's your name?
- Perumal, Sir.

1534
01:35:35,496 --> 01:35:36,474
I'm Vincent.

1535
01:35:37,164 --> 01:35:38,973
Did you come here for purchasing?

1536
01:35:39,100 --> 01:35:40,477
No. My son has a factory here.

1537
01:35:45,272 --> 01:35:47,183
It's been a few days since I smoked.
That's why!

1538
01:35:47,274 --> 01:35:48,810
You want to smoke one?

1539
01:35:48,909 --> 01:35:50,479
I don't have the habit.
But still..

1540
01:35:50,745 --> 01:35:51,815
For you, I will..

1541
01:35:56,517 --> 01:35:57,962
Where do you work, Perumal?

1542
01:35:58,152 --> 01:35:59,529
Sir, I am a tailor.

1543
01:35:59,820 --> 01:36:01,488
I also used to be a tailor.
Long back.

1544
01:36:01,489 --> 01:36:03,469
I started doing business
only after that.

1545
01:36:04,258 --> 01:36:05,896
But I don't have a job now, Sir.

1546
01:36:05,960 --> 01:36:07,837
There's a small union
problem in the factory.

1547
01:36:07,895 --> 01:36:10,363
- But my daughter has a job.
- What job?

1548
01:36:10,364 --> 01:36:12,398
She's working as an account
officer in a company.

1549
01:36:12,399 --> 01:36:14,072
- Do you stay here only?
- No Sir!

1550
01:36:14,135 --> 01:36:16,376
It's a little far.
We have to take a bus daily.

1551
01:36:16,537 --> 01:36:18,210
So you don't have a job.

1552
01:36:18,539 --> 01:36:19,813
Shall we try?

1553
01:36:20,174 --> 01:36:22,518
Let me see if there's any
vacancy in my son's company.

1554
01:36:23,210 --> 01:36:25,545
Sir, if you can do that,
it will be very helpful.

1555
01:36:25,546 --> 01:36:26,524
Let's see!

1556
01:36:28,015 --> 01:36:28,993
Come, Perumal.

1557
01:36:29,183 --> 01:36:31,390
Hey security, why
are you sleeping?

1558
01:36:36,957 --> 01:36:38,300
Perumal, come inside.

1559
01:36:39,894 --> 01:36:40,872
Call the boss.

1560
01:36:41,562 --> 01:36:43,769
It's hot, right?
I'll switch on the AC.

1561
01:36:45,499 --> 01:36:46,534
Sit down please.

1562
01:36:48,335 --> 01:36:50,315
Don't worry, Perumal.
We'll solve everything.

1563
01:36:51,238 --> 01:36:52,216
Okay Sir.

1564
01:36:52,907 --> 01:36:53,885
Who are you?

1565
01:36:53,941 --> 01:36:54,919
Where's Jomon?

1566
01:36:55,409 --> 01:36:56,387
<i>Demon?</i>

1567
01:36:56,577 --> 01:36:57,555
Who is that?

1568
01:36:59,413 --> 01:37:01,484
I think they've come looking
for the previous M.D.

1569
01:37:02,116 --> 01:37:03,959
Sir, this is a new management.

1570
01:37:04,118 --> 01:37:05,096
I am the owner.

1571
01:37:05,252 --> 01:37:06,230
<i>Demon?</i>

1572
01:37:06,587 --> 01:37:07,793
I am his father.

1573
01:37:08,622 --> 01:37:11,535
We don't have anything to
do with the old management.

1574
01:37:13,627 --> 01:37:14,605
It's my fault.

1575
01:37:23,137 --> 01:37:25,344
What? What are you looking at?

1576
01:37:25,506 --> 01:37:27,952
Are you watching a movie?
Go do yourjobs! Go!

1577
01:37:36,250 --> 01:37:37,228
Don't worry Sir!

1578
01:37:37,418 --> 01:37:39,921
Some mistake has happened. That's all.
Come. Let's go!

1579
01:38:10,551 --> 01:38:11,586
Dad!

1580
01:38:18,158 --> 01:38:19,136
Dad?

1581
01:38:32,973 --> 01:38:33,951
Dad!

1582
01:38:36,343 --> 01:38:37,321
You scared me!

1583
01:38:37,511 --> 01:38:40,082
Why are you standing here without
even switching on the light?

1584
01:38:42,216 --> 01:38:45,095
Come. I've brought a special
Biriyani for you today.

1585
01:38:51,258 --> 01:38:52,358
What happened, dad?

1586
01:38:52,359 --> 01:38:53,929
You don't look so good.

1587
01:38:54,295 --> 01:38:56,070
How's your business doing?

1588
01:38:58,232 --> 01:38:59,609
It's progressing well!

1589
01:39:00,467 --> 01:39:02,947
You're getting enough
export orders, right?

1590
01:39:03,404 --> 01:39:05,008
Yea! There are many orders.

1591
01:39:05,673 --> 01:39:08,347
Which all countries do
you export to, mainly?

1592
01:39:08,409 --> 01:39:10,218
Well.. To all major countries.

1593
01:39:10,377 --> 01:39:12,516
America, Europe, Africa, Middle East.

1594
01:39:12,613 --> 01:39:13,591
Everywhere!

1595
01:39:14,081 --> 01:39:15,492
As far as I know,

1596
01:39:15,749 --> 01:39:18,093
when they receive the
materials that we export,

1597
01:39:18,285 --> 01:39:20,553
they will credit cash
to our bank account.

1598
01:39:20,554 --> 01:39:22,033
Isn't it called LC?

1599
01:39:22,389 --> 01:39:23,367
You're good!

1600
01:39:23,457 --> 01:39:24,629
You know all this?

1601
01:39:25,359 --> 01:39:27,999
So it means that my son has
learned how to make money!

1602
01:39:28,462 --> 01:39:29,600
Nothing like that!

1603
01:39:35,636 --> 01:39:38,378
You started fooling me ever since
you could think by yourself.

1604
01:39:39,273 --> 01:39:42,083
Since we had so much money
and a lot more love,

1605
01:39:42,409 --> 01:39:44,582
I considered it just as your
childish mischief back then.

1606
01:39:45,379 --> 01:39:46,357
But now..

1607
01:39:47,114 --> 01:39:49,151
You're still fooling me
even in this situation?

1608
01:39:50,617 --> 01:39:51,595
Dad!

1609
01:39:52,386 --> 01:39:54,059
Earlier, I've fooled you a lot.

1610
01:39:55,289 --> 01:39:56,267
But now..

1611
01:39:57,257 --> 01:39:58,497
I was betrayed.

1612
01:39:59,693 --> 01:40:02,503
I blindly trusted someone
who's a bigger idiot than me.

1613
01:40:02,663 --> 01:40:04,438
Why couldn't you say
that to me then?

1614
01:40:05,666 --> 01:40:08,010
How can I say that to you
when you're already bankrupt?

1615
01:40:08,736 --> 01:40:10,511
Can you bear that as well?

1616
01:40:13,774 --> 01:40:15,412
Your dad started from nothingness.

1617
01:40:16,143 --> 01:40:17,622
I've starved for many weeks.

1618
01:40:18,612 --> 01:40:20,546
Since I didn't have
change to travel by bus,

1619
01:40:20,547 --> 01:40:22,322
I've walked for many kilometres.

1620
01:40:23,350 --> 01:40:26,519
I had a time when I didn't even
have an extra shirt to change into,

1621
01:40:26,520 --> 01:40:28,124
at least once a year.

1622
01:40:29,390 --> 01:40:32,098
Difficulties which your
generation cannot even imagine!

1623
01:40:33,694 --> 01:40:36,129
It's because of the mental
strength I gained back then,

1624
01:40:36,130 --> 01:40:39,009
that I'm still not dead in spite of
all these earthquakes that happened.

1625
01:40:40,434 --> 01:40:42,135
And you didn't tell me anything,

1626
01:40:42,136 --> 01:40:46,243
suffered all alone and was trying
hard to take care of me? Right?

1627
01:40:47,241 --> 01:40:49,243
Your bloody special Biriyani
<i>&</i> cigarettes!

1628
01:40:54,782 --> 01:40:57,786
Your dad is someone who ran behind
money, but slipped and fell hard.

1629
01:40:58,619 --> 01:40:59,791
Whatever it is for,

1630
01:41:00,154 --> 01:41:01,758
you needn't run behind it.

1631
01:41:03,123 --> 01:41:07,435
I can even be happy with some rice
soup and a piece of sack to sleep on!

1632
01:41:09,129 --> 01:41:11,302
If God wants a father <i>&</i> son
who went behind luxury,

1633
01:41:11,532 --> 01:41:14,479
to live modestly for sometime,

1634
01:41:14,601 --> 01:41:16,046
we can live modestly, man!

1635
01:41:16,170 --> 01:41:17,205
What else to do?

1636
01:41:18,705 --> 01:41:23,347
So, we are letting go of all our
luxuries including this flat, from today.

1637
01:41:23,710 --> 01:41:25,621
We can survive with
limited facilities, son.

1638
01:41:27,481 --> 01:41:30,087
No one can defeat people
who have lost everything!

1639
01:41:31,318 --> 01:41:33,127
Just be there with me!

1640
01:42:05,686 --> 01:42:12,126
Hey fragrant breeze,
don't you want a flowery umbrella?

1641
01:42:12,192 --> 01:42:18,438
Spring has arrived, don't you
want drum-rolls to welcome you?

1642
01:42:18,832 --> 01:42:24,646
You vanished without a word
and have come back now,

1643
01:42:24,705 --> 01:42:30,246
Don't ever go away again!

1644
01:42:31,311 --> 01:42:37,626
Hey fragrant breeze,
don't you want a flowery umbrella?

1645
01:42:37,718 --> 01:42:43,669
Spring has arrived, don't you
want drum-rolls to welcome you?

1646
01:43:15,989 --> 01:43:22,964
Have you wandered in search
of the heavenly flower, 0' breeze,

1647
01:43:23,197 --> 01:43:28,613
without coming
near me, far away!

1648
01:43:28,802 --> 01:43:33,802
Did you get lost swimming in the
milky ocean waves, 0' breeze?

1649
01:43:35,776 --> 01:43:40,953
I shed futile silent
tears in my dreams!

1650
01:43:41,014 --> 01:43:46,014
To fill these branches
with flowers again,

1651
01:43:54,828 --> 01:44:00,744
have you silently returned?

1652
01:44:00,867 --> 01:44:07,284
Hey fragrant breeze, don't
you want a flowery umbrella?

1653
01:44:07,341 --> 01:44:14,281
Spring has arrived, don't you
want drum-rolls to welcome you?

1654
01:44:39,706 --> 01:44:42,842
The darkness of the night will vanish,

1655
01:44:42,843 --> 01:44:46,313
The sky will clear tomorrow,

1656
01:44:46,413 --> 01:44:50,884
Every single flower from the
field will adorn colours!

1657
01:44:52,519 --> 01:44:58,435
Strings of water will live
the lengths of this earth,

1658
01:44:58,525 --> 01:45:04,271
coupled with the fragrance
of the misty moonlight!

1659
01:45:04,431 --> 01:45:12,976
I always hoped you
would come one day,

1660
01:45:13,040 --> 01:45:18,040
to weave the cloudy fabrics
with flashes of lightning.

1661
01:45:24,051 --> 01:45:29,051
Hey fragrant breeze, don't
you want a flowery umbrella?

1662
01:45:30,524 --> 01:45:37,442
Spring has arrived, don't you
want drum-rolls to welcome you?

1663
01:46:11,164 --> 01:46:12,142
<i>Yes.
(in Malayalam)</i>

1664
01:46:13,367 --> 01:46:15,677
I've given the list of
exports to Lakshmi.

1665
01:46:16,136 --> 01:46:17,470
Please call Lakshmi.

1666
01:46:17,471 --> 01:46:18,449
Okay.

1667
01:46:19,506 --> 01:46:20,644
<i>You're a Malayali?</i>

1668
01:46:21,441 --> 01:46:22,476
<i>I know Malayalam.</i>

1669
01:46:23,677 --> 01:46:25,452
I haven't received
your mail yet.

1670
01:46:25,779 --> 01:46:27,918
Unless I get the mail, I
can't issue the cheque.

1671
01:46:30,183 --> 01:46:33,130
Madam, by the time I get a mobile
data recharge, it'll be late.

1672
01:46:33,186 --> 01:46:36,133
So if you can give me the WiFi
password, I'll send it right away!

1673
01:46:36,690 --> 01:46:38,829
I can't reveal the
company's WiFi password.

1674
01:46:41,495 --> 01:46:42,667
She's a true Malayali!

1675
01:46:57,644 --> 01:46:59,011
Can I ask you something?

1676
01:46:59,012 --> 01:47:01,424
- Go ahead!
- Sir, have you acted in Malayalam films?

1677
01:47:01,581 --> 01:47:02,559
Me?

1678
01:47:02,682 --> 01:47:05,458
<i>Sir, a Malayalam star has
your exact same face-cut.</i>

1679
01:47:05,652 --> 01:47:07,461
- Stop kidding, brother!
- I swear, Sir.

1680
01:47:07,521 --> 01:47:09,125
- Shall I show it?
- Show!

1681
01:47:13,527 --> 01:47:15,006
I'm busy.
Call me later.

1682
01:47:16,797 --> 01:47:18,504
- Like me?
- There's no internet!

1683
01:47:18,865 --> 01:47:20,503
- Sir, do you have WiFi here?
- Yes!

1684
01:47:20,600 --> 01:47:21,908
Sir, please give me the password.

1685
01:47:42,489 --> 01:47:44,491
- Sir, you didn't show me the star!
- Oh! Sorry Sir!

1686
01:47:53,900 --> 01:47:55,106
Sir, this is all make-up!

1687
01:47:55,168 --> 01:47:56,909
In real life, he looks
really handsome!

1688
01:48:02,509 --> 01:48:03,487
Here VOu go!

1689
01:48:04,945 --> 01:48:09,519
Hereafter, if some poor salesman asks the
WiFi password for an emergency, tell him!

1690
01:48:09,783 --> 01:48:11,558
It's 'Vaidehi123'

1691
01:48:12,719 --> 01:48:14,062
Your name is Vaidehi, right?

1692
01:48:14,621 --> 01:48:16,191
123 are your initials?

1693
01:48:29,069 --> 01:48:30,047
How is it?

1694
01:48:30,103 --> 01:48:32,743
- You brought the old board here?
- That's all we had left!

1695
01:48:32,906 --> 01:48:34,240
Suits very well!

1696
01:48:34,241 --> 01:48:36,050
Like a tomato box locked
with a Godrej lock.

1697
01:48:36,910 --> 01:48:38,753
Check it out and then tell me.

1698
01:48:39,179 --> 01:48:40,283
Don't hit your head.

1699
01:48:40,647 --> 01:48:41,625
This is it.

1700
01:48:41,781 --> 01:48:43,283
- Is this a cave?
- Come, man!

1701
01:48:43,617 --> 01:48:45,153
You made this in
your height or what?

1702
01:48:45,519 --> 01:48:46,785
Huge set-up, eh?

1703
01:48:46,786 --> 01:48:48,288
I know. Here's the account book!

1704
01:48:49,189 --> 01:48:51,223
You should check the
accounts from the beginning.

1705
01:48:51,224 --> 01:48:53,135
It's good to have a
control over me.

1706
01:48:56,796 --> 01:48:59,299
Did you notice that the company
has moved towards a profit?

1707
01:48:59,933 --> 01:49:00,911
900 Rupees!

1708
01:49:01,635 --> 01:49:04,081
Instead of the Rs.1200 you
spent to call a pick-up,

1709
01:49:04,137 --> 01:49:06,549
if you had taken it in a bus,
it would've cost only Rs.100.

1710
01:49:06,740 --> 01:49:08,219
If so, the profit
would've been 2000.

1711
01:49:08,308 --> 01:49:09,616
In a bus?
Me?

1712
01:49:09,943 --> 01:49:10,944
Who do you think you are?

1713
01:49:11,011 --> 01:49:13,617
You sell peanuts <i>&</i> want
to have a lifestyle of a king?

1714
01:49:13,680 --> 01:49:15,318
Will I become a king if
I call for a pick-up?

1715
01:49:15,549 --> 01:49:18,325
Dude, no one has become anything without
struggling at a grass root level.

1716
01:49:18,552 --> 01:49:19,895
When did you learn all this?

1717
01:49:19,986 --> 01:49:21,897
I've just started learning,
my dear Mushtaq!

1718
01:49:23,156 --> 01:49:26,262
I was a tailor like you before
I became the manager!

1719
01:49:29,829 --> 01:49:31,934
Sir, we haven't received any
orders for a longtime!

1720
01:49:31,998 --> 01:49:35,138
Vaidehi handles the orders.
Talk to her.

1721
01:49:35,335 --> 01:49:36,769
Okay Sir.
Thank you!

1722
01:49:36,770 --> 01:49:38,010
Why is he looking at my teeth?

1723
01:49:43,810 --> 01:49:44,810
Hey!

1724
01:49:44,811 --> 01:49:47,792
Sri Venkateshwara Mills <i>&</i> this company
had a long term relationship.

1725
01:49:47,948 --> 01:49:49,655
But we haven't received
any new orders.

1726
01:49:50,183 --> 01:49:51,890
You didn't get any
from the manager'?

1727
01:49:52,052 --> 01:49:54,658
Manager said that Vaidehi
madam is the all-in-all here.

1728
01:49:55,388 --> 01:49:58,733
- I've given the order to another company.
- Another com pany? Which one?

1729
01:49:59,092 --> 01:50:01,360
I gave it to an innocent
salesman who's not over smart

1730
01:50:01,361 --> 01:50:03,341
<i>&</i> doesn't ask for the
company's WiFi password.

1731
01:50:03,396 --> 01:50:05,376
Oh no! Miss Vaidehi,
you've misunderstood me.

1732
01:50:05,865 --> 01:50:06,935
I'm also an innocent guy!

1733
01:50:07,300 --> 01:50:08,802
Just that I don't look like it.

1734
01:50:18,078 --> 01:50:20,854
If you're going to check your mail,
I've changed the WiFi password.

1735
01:50:23,683 --> 01:50:25,060
But by the time I come again,

1736
01:50:25,218 --> 01:50:27,698
I'll pray that your anger
towards me is gone!

1737
01:50:30,357 --> 01:50:31,859
Shall I ask you something else too?

1738
01:50:32,959 --> 01:50:34,768
Have you placed a
bet with someone?

1739
01:50:35,996 --> 01:50:39,603
That you will never move the muscles
of your face to form a smile?

1740
01:50:43,837 --> 01:50:46,750
The smiles on our faces, are the
blessings of God within us.

1741
01:50:47,340 --> 01:50:48,375
If we don't smile,

1742
01:50:48,642 --> 01:50:51,977
these blessings that God wants to
distribute freely to many, would be wasted!

1743
01:50:51,978 --> 01:50:52,956
$0..

1744
01:50:53,046 --> 01:50:54,423
I know it's difficult for you.

1745
01:50:54,881 --> 01:50:55,916
Still, just try it.

1746
01:50:59,886 --> 01:51:01,729
It's a blessing from God.
That's why!

1747
01:51:08,895 --> 01:51:09,873
That's it!

1748
01:51:19,472 --> 01:51:21,918
Mushtaq, don't play around!

1749
01:51:22,409 --> 01:51:23,752
The bus will leave now.

1750
01:51:23,810 --> 01:51:27,121
Bro, they haven't fixed the elastic on many
briefs that I've to deliver today.

1751
01:51:27,313 --> 01:51:28,451
I'm running behind that.

1752
01:51:28,815 --> 01:51:31,283
You do something. Call a
pick-up for today as well.

1753
01:51:31,284 --> 01:51:32,262
Pick-up?

1754
01:51:32,318 --> 01:51:33,319
Don't get me talking!

1755
01:51:33,887 --> 01:51:36,060
I'll show you how to
live by working hard!

1756
01:51:43,897 --> 01:51:44,875
Brother,

1757
01:51:45,065 --> 01:51:46,476
can you help me keep it on top?

1758
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:47,978
Come!

1759
01:52:17,097 --> 01:52:18,735
I forgot to work out
in the morning.

1760
01:52:26,840 --> 01:52:27,818
Oh my God!

1761
01:52:31,478 --> 01:52:33,355
Do you travel by the bus
daily, Miss Vaidehi?

1762
01:52:35,048 --> 01:52:37,995
You're still working for Sri
Venkateshwara mill, right?

1763
01:52:38,051 --> 01:52:39,029
Yes!

1764
01:52:39,085 --> 01:52:40,325
New orders are ready?

1765
01:52:40,386 --> 01:52:42,388
Is this a company job or...

1766
01:52:42,856 --> 01:52:44,335
a side-business in
between your duty?

1767
01:52:44,858 --> 01:52:45,996
Nothing like that.

1768
01:52:47,327 --> 01:52:49,739
Does the company know that
you're doing a side-business?

1769
01:52:49,796 --> 01:52:50,796
No!

1770
01:52:50,797 --> 01:52:52,037
Then I'll tell them!

1771
01:52:52,098 --> 01:52:53,736
Don't do that to me, Miss Vaidehi!

1772
01:52:54,200 --> 01:52:55,873
I know your boss personally.

1773
01:52:56,536 --> 01:52:58,174
Where the hell has she come from?

1774
01:53:00,807 --> 01:53:02,207
Okay right!
Let's go!

1775
01:53:02,208 --> 01:53:04,051
Those standing on the
foot-board, get inside!

1776
01:53:18,792 --> 01:53:21,170
You've stopped the bus
in the middle of the road!

1777
01:53:21,227 --> 01:53:23,207
Don't shout! The
driver will come.

1778
01:53:23,530 --> 01:53:25,397
- He will come now.
- We have to go home!

1779
01:53:25,398 --> 01:53:27,071
Everyone wants to go home!

1780
01:53:27,133 --> 01:53:28,237
How dare you stop the bus?

1781
01:53:28,334 --> 01:53:30,837
What's there to dare in this?
Wait for some time.

1782
01:53:30,970 --> 01:53:34,406
Diesel is over? Repair? Puncture?
How do I know?

1783
01:53:34,407 --> 01:53:36,408
If you keep shouting"
He has gone somewhere!

1784
01:53:36,409 --> 01:53:38,355
- Let him come! Wait!
- Hey!

1785
01:53:38,912 --> 01:53:40,391
What's the ruckus over there?

1786
01:53:40,814 --> 01:53:42,589
Can't you wait for 10 minutes?

1787
01:53:42,849 --> 01:53:44,516
Don't create a fuss.
Come start the bus!

1788
01:53:44,517 --> 01:53:46,224
- They are angry. Come fast!

1789
01:53:46,352 --> 01:53:48,093
Hey old man! What's
your problem?

1790
01:53:48,188 --> 01:53:49,394
Such audacity!

1791
01:53:49,489 --> 01:53:50,489
Start the bus!

1792
01:53:50,490 --> 01:53:52,424
You're playing with our lives?
You can't drive!

1793
01:53:52,425 --> 01:53:54,960
I've been drinking <i>&</i> driving in
this route for 14 years now!

1794
01:53:54,961 --> 01:53:56,304
And what's wrong with you now?

1795
01:53:56,362 --> 01:53:58,205
You know who I am?
Get lost!

1796
01:53:58,264 --> 01:53:59,538
I will drive like this only!

1797
01:53:59,599 --> 01:54:00,577
Leave me!

1798
01:54:02,402 --> 01:54:05,474
The bus won't move from here today.
Let me see how it goes!

1799
01:54:05,538 --> 01:54:06,572
All of you go walking!

1800
01:54:06,573 --> 01:54:08,177
- What's the problem?
- Get lost!

1801
01:54:08,341 --> 01:54:09,581
The bus won't leave!

1802
01:54:13,479 --> 01:54:14,822
If you dare,

1803
01:54:15,081 --> 01:54:16,059
See this key!

1804
01:54:16,316 --> 01:54:17,590
Take it! Let me see!

1805
01:54:30,530 --> 01:54:33,101
- Thank you, son!
- Everyone, get in!

1806
01:54:33,199 --> 01:54:35,611
The bus is leaving.
Get in! Let's go!

1807
01:54:44,444 --> 01:54:46,117
Hey! My bus!

1808
01:55:22,949 --> 01:55:25,984
Thank you so much.
You saved us <i>&</i> brought us home.

1809
01:55:25,985 --> 01:55:27,430
God bless you!

1810
01:55:28,254 --> 01:55:30,359
You drove better
than the driver!

1811
01:55:33,226 --> 01:55:35,433
He won't drink <i>&</i> drive ever again!

1812
01:55:35,561 --> 01:55:38,940
There should be people like this boy! Only
then guys like him will learn a lesson.

1813
01:56:58,277 --> 01:56:59,517
Stop here, brother.

1814
01:57:00,780 --> 01:57:01,758
That's it!

1815
01:57:07,420 --> 01:57:09,024
Leave it, Sir.
I'll get it for you.

1816
01:57:10,623 --> 01:57:12,424
Brother, when is the
next bus to the town?

1817
01:57:12,425 --> 01:57:15,031
- Next bus is only at 7 in the morning!
-7 in the morning?

1818
01:57:18,731 --> 01:57:20,039
Didn't I warn you?

1819
01:57:20,366 --> 01:57:21,640
Dude, at least now,

1820
01:57:21,801 --> 01:57:23,802
call a pick-up and
come here quickly!

1821
01:57:23,803 --> 01:57:26,113
Pick-up! Don't utter
that word again!

1822
01:57:26,172 --> 01:57:27,150
Cut the call!

1823
01:57:27,407 --> 01:57:29,717
- Him <i>&</i> his bloody pick-up!
- Who is he? Standing alone?

1824
01:57:29,842 --> 01:57:31,480
- Is he a thief?
- Sir, Sir!

1825
01:57:32,045 --> 01:57:33,524
Can I get a pick-up here?

1826
01:57:35,281 --> 01:57:36,259
Pick-up?

1827
01:57:37,116 --> 01:57:38,652
To take all this to the town.

1828
01:57:39,285 --> 01:57:40,696
You won't get all
that over here.

1829
01:57:42,588 --> 01:57:44,124
Is there any lodge
where I can stay?

1830
01:57:44,557 --> 01:57:45,535
Malayali?

1831
01:57:45,658 --> 01:57:46,636
Yes!

1832
01:57:47,126 --> 01:57:48,628
There are no lodges here, Sir.

1833
01:57:48,828 --> 01:57:50,398
Where will I sleep then?

1834
01:57:51,230 --> 01:57:52,470
You can sleep anywhere.

1835
01:57:52,698 --> 01:57:54,678
Just that some snakes
or mad dogs may come.

1836
01:57:54,734 --> 01:57:56,168
There won't be any
other problem!

1837
01:57:56,169 --> 01:57:57,147
Gosh!

1838
01:57:59,605 --> 01:58:02,518
When I saw you standing alone,
I thought you were a thief.

1839
01:58:02,675 --> 01:58:04,279
Don't get me wrong.

1840
01:58:04,544 --> 01:58:05,818
I didn't think it'll be so late.

1841
01:58:06,145 --> 01:58:07,145
Dear,

1842
01:58:07,146 --> 01:58:09,422
he came to get materials,
and missed his bus.

1843
01:58:09,482 --> 01:58:11,860
He's a Malayali.
This is my daughter, Vaidehi.

1844
01:58:17,690 --> 01:58:19,397
Don't be shy.
Eat well!

1845
01:58:19,492 --> 01:58:21,593
You know why I'm
having this rice soup?

1846
01:58:21,594 --> 01:58:23,267
This has got Vitamin E.

1847
01:58:23,830 --> 01:58:24,808
Dad!

1848
01:58:24,897 --> 01:58:26,467
Okay!
Pour it!

1849
01:58:48,888 --> 01:58:49,866
Thank you!

1850
01:58:50,857 --> 01:58:52,700
You became a big hero
by riding the bus, huh?

1851
01:58:54,427 --> 01:58:55,838
Were you a bus driver
back in Kerala?

1852
01:58:58,164 --> 01:58:59,164
Back in Kerala,

1853
01:58:59,165 --> 01:59:00,473
we had many buses,

1854
01:59:00,566 --> 01:59:01,544
of our own.

1855
01:59:03,302 --> 01:59:04,280
Hey..

1856
01:59:09,509 --> 01:59:11,716
So you've started distributing
God's blessings?

1857
01:59:13,779 --> 01:59:15,588
I really liked your village.

1858
01:59:22,255 --> 01:59:24,235
We are going to shift to the town.

1859
01:59:24,457 --> 01:59:26,562
The construction of our new
house is happening there.

1860
01:59:26,859 --> 01:59:28,566
So you can avoid this
daily travel, right?

1861
01:59:28,661 --> 01:59:29,639
Yes.

1862
01:59:29,829 --> 01:59:32,469
But the house became
bigger than we thought.

1863
01:59:32,832 --> 01:59:34,243
It's in the finishing stage now.

1864
01:59:34,700 --> 01:59:36,179
You speak Malayalam very well.

1865
01:59:36,269 --> 01:59:37,577
Mom's house was in Palakkad.

1866
01:59:37,803 --> 01:59:38,941
I have come there.

1867
01:59:39,772 --> 01:59:42,446
You know what I like the
most in your Kerala?

1868
01:59:45,645 --> 01:59:46,623
Or else, rain?

1869
01:59:46,812 --> 01:59:47,790
Or the rivers!

1870
01:59:47,880 --> 01:59:49,553
These are the usual
nostalgia elements!

1871
01:59:50,316 --> 01:59:51,294
Sardine!
(Fish)

1872
01:59:51,551 --> 01:59:52,529
Sardine?

1873
01:59:53,319 --> 01:59:55,356
I like it fried and even as a curry!

1874
01:59:56,789 --> 01:59:58,769
Even all of you like it, right?
Then what?

1875
01:59:59,292 --> 02:00:00,959
Is sardine so unromantic?

1876
02:00:00,960 --> 02:00:01,938
No!

1877
02:00:01,994 --> 02:00:02,972
<i>Never'.</i>

1878
02:00:03,396 --> 02:00:06,639
From today, the most romantic
thing in Kerala will be sardine!

1879
02:00:35,595 --> 02:00:36,835
Phew! He has come!

1880
02:00:37,630 --> 02:00:39,439
How come you're so late, Sir?

1881
02:00:39,832 --> 02:00:42,312
Is it right to be late
on the first day itself?

1882
02:00:42,401 --> 02:00:44,836
My son was late to leave.
If he knows this, it'll be a problem.

1883
02:00:44,837 --> 02:00:45,815
Okay. Come.

1884
02:00:47,039 --> 02:00:48,340
Sir, why are you standing?

1885
02:00:48,341 --> 02:00:49,718
Perumal, this is huge!

1886
02:00:49,775 --> 02:00:52,510
That's why every textile
business comes to Tiruppur.

1887
02:00:52,511 --> 02:00:53,683
You can see this only here.

1888
02:00:54,747 --> 02:00:56,886
Sir, this is your seat.
This is my seat.

1889
02:00:56,983 --> 02:00:57,961
Start working!

1890
02:00:58,050 --> 02:00:59,028
Perumal!

1891
02:00:59,252 --> 02:01:01,620
It's been a long time since I
touched these. I'm out of touch!

1892
02:01:01,621 --> 02:01:02,725
That's okay, Sir.

1893
02:01:02,822 --> 02:01:05,701
It's not necessary that you should
do all the work like old times!

1894
02:01:05,825 --> 02:01:09,861
Like I said, it's enough if you do a
single stitch from morning to evening.

1895
02:01:09,862 --> 02:01:11,398
- Single stitching means?
- Sir!

1896
02:01:11,530 --> 02:01:13,510
You said you wanted a time-pass, right?

1897
02:01:13,566 --> 02:01:15,603
So simply do that!
Sit down!

1898
02:01:53,839 --> 02:01:55,841
You haven't told me the
reason for this treat yet.

1899
02:01:56,742 --> 02:01:57,720
Well..

1900
02:01:57,843 --> 02:02:00,983
Our company got a good order from
the reference you gave, Vaidehi.

1901
02:02:01,981 --> 02:02:04,860
To be frank, we're able to survive
now because of that! Right?

1902
02:02:05,084 --> 02:02:06,062
Ya.

1903
02:02:12,024 --> 02:02:14,868
Hey, we haven't received the payment
for the building materials yet!

1904
02:02:14,994 --> 02:02:16,803
I'll pay some of it from
this month's salary.

1905
02:02:16,929 --> 02:02:18,596
I'll settle it fully
next month, Sir.

1906
02:02:18,597 --> 02:02:20,406
You said the same
thing last month too!

1907
02:02:20,499 --> 02:02:21,477
No, Sir.

1908
02:02:21,634 --> 02:02:23,045
This time I'll
definitely pay you!

1909
02:02:31,811 --> 02:02:34,451
Construction of our house is
going on, right? This was for that.

1910
02:02:35,948 --> 02:02:37,325
Don't get us wrong.

1911
02:02:38,150 --> 02:02:40,130
We had decided something
when we got that order.

1912
02:02:41,620 --> 02:02:43,497
That one share of the
profit belongs to you!

1913
02:02:43,889 --> 02:02:44,993
For me?
Why?

1914
02:02:45,057 --> 02:02:46,092
Get me that bag.

1915
02:02:47,159 --> 02:02:48,399
I don't need it.

1916
02:02:48,461 --> 02:02:50,907
- Are you trying to bribe me?
- Don't say anything. Please!

1917
02:02:51,430 --> 02:02:53,603
Construction is going on, right?
You'll need the money.

1918
02:02:56,135 --> 02:02:57,113
Jomon, I...

1919
02:03:04,610 --> 02:03:06,817
It's time for my bus.
I'm leaving.

1920
02:03:14,153 --> 02:03:15,887
I'll walk her to the
bus stop & come back.

1921
02:03:15,888 --> 02:03:17,424
- Ah! Carry on!
- Get lost!

1922
02:03:24,063 --> 02:03:25,940
Still angry that
we gave you money?

1923
02:03:27,433 --> 02:03:28,411
Actually,

1924
02:03:28,834 --> 02:03:30,836
I needed some cash urgently.

1925
02:03:32,037 --> 02:03:34,813
But I don't have any friends who
are close enough to ask money from!

1926
02:03:36,742 --> 02:03:39,188
When mom died, I
became a real loner.

1927
02:03:40,880 --> 02:03:42,154
I even forgot how to smile!

1928
02:03:43,416 --> 02:03:45,987
Even if we're meeting some
people for the first time,

1929
02:03:46,485 --> 02:03:48,431
you feel like you've met
them earlier, right?

1930
02:03:48,654 --> 02:03:49,654
Like that,

1931
02:03:49,655 --> 02:03:52,465
when you think about someone whom
you haven't met for a long time,

1932
02:03:52,892 --> 02:03:55,930
sometimes that person suddenly
comes in front of you, right?

1933
02:03:57,196 --> 02:03:59,733
There are some explanations for
all these in Hindu philosophy.

1934
02:04:00,199 --> 02:04:02,907
I am feeling some such
confidence in you!

1935
02:04:03,669 --> 02:04:07,674
That's why my pride allowed
me to accept money from you.

1936
02:04:41,507 --> 02:04:43,851
Where is he going?

1937
02:04:44,210 --> 02:04:45,518
I should follow him!

1938
02:05:19,778 --> 02:05:21,815
So all this build
up was for this?

1939
02:05:36,629 --> 02:05:39,508
2 cents of land, 650 square feet,

1940
02:05:39,632 --> 02:05:41,612
we can even ride an
auto rickshaw inside.

1941
02:05:41,867 --> 02:05:43,710
In a city like Tiruppur,

1942
02:05:43,802 --> 02:05:45,670
can someone else build
a house like this?

1943
02:05:45,671 --> 02:05:46,649
No way!

1944
02:05:46,739 --> 02:05:48,082
You have to agree!
Drink the milk.

1945
02:05:55,548 --> 02:05:57,186
Take a picture of mine
along with the house!

1946
02:05:57,816 --> 02:05:58,816
Dad!

1947
02:05:58,817 --> 02:06:00,818
Didn't I tell you about my friend?
He has come!

1948
02:06:00,819 --> 02:06:01,957
You go. I'll come!

1949
02:06:02,221 --> 02:06:03,598
Vaidehi's friend.

1950
02:06:03,923 --> 02:06:05,834
Friend means" they
are thick friends!

1951
02:06:05,891 --> 02:06:07,029
- Is that so?
- Yes.

1952
02:06:07,092 --> 02:06:08,162
Come. Let's go inside.

1953
02:06:10,563 --> 02:06:12,230
Why are you being formal
with a gift and all?

1954
02:06:12,231 --> 02:06:13,798
Housewarming, right?
Keep it!

1955
02:06:13,799 --> 02:06:15,039
Okay. I'll just be back.

1956
02:06:18,170 --> 02:06:21,039
Vincent Sir, this is Mr.Jomon.
Also from Kerala.

1957
02:06:21,040 --> 02:06:22,280
Vaidehi's friend.

1958
02:06:22,641 --> 02:06:24,279
- Didn't I tell you?
- Yea!

1959
02:06:24,677 --> 02:06:27,123
- This is Vincent Sir. My friend!
- Also from Kerala.

1960
02:06:27,646 --> 02:06:29,626
Mr.Jomon, where are
you from, in Kerala?

1961
02:06:29,682 --> 02:06:30,682
In:

1962
02:06:30,683 --> 02:06:31,821
I'm from Thrisshur, Sir.

1963
02:06:33,652 --> 02:06:35,154
I am also from Thrisshur!

1964
02:06:35,220 --> 02:06:37,689
- Both of you are from the same town?
- Yes!

1965
02:06:37,690 --> 02:06:38,725
Then what? Come!

1966
02:06:38,791 --> 02:06:40,031
Let's see the house.

1967
02:06:41,894 --> 02:06:43,601
Come, Sir.
This is the kitchen.

1968
02:06:43,762 --> 02:06:45,173
Saw this? Gas stove!

1969
02:06:45,397 --> 02:06:48,003
You can boil 10 kilos of
rice at the same time!

1970
02:06:49,335 --> 02:06:51,178
See this! A steel shelf!

1971
02:06:51,236 --> 02:06:53,341
We can arrange how many
ever vessels in here.

1972
02:06:53,639 --> 02:06:54,879
Apart from these,

1973
02:06:54,940 --> 02:06:57,853
I'll show you another
important place. Come!

1974
02:06:57,910 --> 02:06:58,888
I'll go get it.

1975
02:06:59,244 --> 02:07:01,212
You are all Vaidehi's friends?

1976
02:07:01,213 --> 02:07:02,191
Yes uncle.

1977
02:07:02,314 --> 02:07:05,022
If the window is open,
we can touch the sun!

1978
02:07:05,217 --> 02:07:06,787
See this.
A ceiling fan!

1979
02:07:06,885 --> 02:07:09,161
It costs Rs.499 and 99 paise.

1980
02:07:09,288 --> 02:07:12,357
I don't know why they
charge those 99 paise, Sir!

1981
02:07:12,358 --> 02:07:13,336
See this.

1982
02:07:14,226 --> 02:07:16,172
Look! A bathroom
inside the house!

1983
02:07:17,396 --> 02:07:18,396
Exhaust fan?

1984
02:07:18,397 --> 02:07:19,375
Yes!

1985
02:07:19,665 --> 02:07:21,804
The air from outside
will come inside!

1986
02:07:21,967 --> 02:07:24,777
If you go inside, you
can sit there in peace!

1987
02:07:26,238 --> 02:07:27,774
We have just one life.

1988
02:07:28,207 --> 02:07:30,050
What's the point in
saving all our money?

1989
02:07:30,209 --> 02:07:32,780
Spend it lavishly and you
can be really happy!

1990
02:07:32,878 --> 02:07:35,051
- That's correct. Right, Mr.Jomon?
- Yes, Mr.Vincent!

1991
02:07:35,714 --> 02:07:37,057
Okay, Sir. I'll come later"

1992
02:07:37,149 --> 02:07:39,686
How can you leave so quickly?

1993
02:07:39,785 --> 02:07:41,924
Dinner is ready. Have
it before you leave!

1994
02:07:47,159 --> 02:07:50,038
Perumal said that his daughter
is a thick friend of yours?

1995
02:07:50,095 --> 02:07:51,199
When did this happen?

1996
02:07:51,363 --> 02:07:52,363
That"

1997
02:07:52,364 --> 02:07:54,742
Her company gives many orders
to our company. That's how!

1998
02:07:54,800 --> 02:07:57,781
- So it's a relation between 2 companies.
- Yes!

1999
02:07:57,836 --> 02:07:59,076
Then it's all right!

2000
02:08:00,105 --> 02:08:01,209
Where did you get this from?

2001
02:08:02,107 --> 02:08:04,383
You thought I won't get it
if you don't buy it for me?

2002
02:08:05,411 --> 02:08:06,788
Didn't you stop this habit?

2003
02:08:07,112 --> 02:08:08,946
Tell me the truth.
Where did you get it from?

2004
02:08:08,947 --> 02:08:10,392
Well.. It's from an old stock.

2005
02:08:10,449 --> 02:08:13,089
It was lying between the bags.
Why should I waste it?

2006
02:08:13,352 --> 02:08:15,253
Don't smoke in front of me!

2007
02:08:15,254 --> 02:08:16,392
Don't stamp on it!

2008
02:08:16,955 --> 02:08:18,957
You don't know how much
that cigarette costs!

2009
02:08:19,058 --> 02:08:21,359
- I'll find out the cost myself!
- Don't touch the packet!

2010
02:08:21,360 --> 02:08:23,033
Throwing away the
cigarette from my lip,

2011
02:08:23,095 --> 02:08:24,733
throwing my packet away,

2012
02:08:24,797 --> 02:08:25,897
who are you? My father?

2013
02:08:25,898 --> 02:08:26,968
Your grandfather!

2014
02:08:33,706 --> 02:08:35,406
Sir, we'll definitely give it this time.

2015
02:08:35,407 --> 02:08:37,809
Don't make it late like last time.
Deliver it on time!

2016
02:08:37,810 --> 02:08:39,687
- It's a very prestigious order.
- Okay.

2017
02:08:41,413 --> 02:08:42,391
No pocket?

2018
02:08:48,754 --> 02:08:49,732
Dad!

2019
02:08:52,891 --> 02:08:55,201
I was just giving
Perumal some company.

2020
02:08:55,928 --> 02:08:57,895
- Come with me.
- It's not like you think!

2021
02:08:57,896 --> 02:08:59,136
- Jomon!
- Let me explain!

2022
02:08:59,498 --> 02:09:02,266
What are you doing? Aren't
you both from the same town?

2023
02:09:02,267 --> 02:09:03,803
This is between us father <i>&</i> son!

2024
02:09:04,837 --> 02:09:06,248
Your stupid thoughts
in this old age.

2025
02:09:07,239 --> 02:09:08,239
<i>Demon'.!</i>

2026
02:09:08,240 --> 02:09:09,776
- Father?
- He's my son.

2027
02:09:12,311 --> 02:09:13,289
Wait!

2028
02:09:13,512 --> 02:09:15,048
I'm not that old yet.

2029
02:09:15,314 --> 02:09:16,952
Didn't you hide many
things from me?

2030
02:09:17,015 --> 02:09:18,517
I hid this from you.

2031
02:09:18,751 --> 02:09:19,729
Now we're even.

2032
02:09:20,018 --> 02:09:21,519
If you don't like it, I'll stop it!

2033
02:09:21,520 --> 02:09:22,760
I'll quit today!

2034
02:09:24,857 --> 02:09:27,064
The only luxury left
for me are cigarettes.

2035
02:09:27,359 --> 02:09:30,067
I thought I'll at least make the
money to buy them on my own..

2036
02:09:50,182 --> 02:09:54,153
'From a distance, the Lord
appeared before him and said,

2037
02:09:54,553 --> 02:09:57,193
'The love I have for you is infinite.

2038
02:09:57,356 --> 02:09:59,962
The trust I have in you is unshakeable.

2039
02:10:00,259 --> 02:10:05,004
But those who hope in the Lord
will renew their strength.

2040
02:10:05,330 --> 02:10:08,174
They will soar on wings like eagles;

2041
02:10:08,267 --> 02:10:10,372
they will run and
not grow weary,

2042
02:10:10,435 --> 02:10:12,415
they will walk and not be faint.'

2043
02:10:12,571 --> 02:10:13,982
Praise the Lord!

2044
02:10:14,506 --> 02:10:16,543
Did you become a Father suddenly?
A priest?

2045
02:10:16,909 --> 02:10:17,887
Who is it?

2046
02:10:18,277 --> 02:10:19,779
Is it really you, Jomon?

2047
02:10:20,212 --> 02:10:21,486
I can't see properly!

2048
02:10:21,847 --> 02:10:22,947
I'm old, right?

2049
02:10:22,948 --> 02:10:24,928
I've brought a medicine
for you to turn younger.

2050
02:10:26,251 --> 02:10:28,822
If you smoke this, you won't grow old;
and your hair won't gray!

2051
02:10:29,421 --> 02:10:31,901
Who said that the hair doesn't
gray if you smoke cigarettes?

2052
02:10:31,957 --> 02:10:33,903
You won't get time till the
hair grays completely!

2053
02:10:33,959 --> 02:10:36,064
- You'll die before that, right?
- Oh. Like that!

2054
02:10:38,597 --> 02:10:41,077
But I never thought you would
go for a job just to beat me.

2055
02:10:43,502 --> 02:10:45,937
Isn't it because I want to be
with you for a longer time,

2056
02:10:45,938 --> 02:10:47,611
that I didn't buy it for you?

2057
02:11:15,400 --> 02:11:17,402
I also want to be with
you for a long time!

2058
02:11:42,227 --> 02:11:43,934
- What happened, Sir?
- Come!

2059
02:11:43,996 --> 02:11:45,998
How do I show you how
I got beaten up?

2060
02:11:54,439 --> 02:11:56,316
What happened to your face?
Was it an accident?

2061
02:11:57,009 --> 02:11:57,987
That's nothing!

2062
02:11:58,210 --> 02:12:00,247
Okay! How many years have
you been working here?

2063
02:12:00,345 --> 02:12:02,951
Must be around 3 or 3
and a half years, Sir.

2064
02:12:03,015 --> 02:12:04,015
Are you haPPV7

2065
02:12:04,016 --> 02:12:05,154
I'm happy, Sir.
What happened?

2066
02:12:05,217 --> 02:12:07,197
You want only this happiness in life?

2067
02:12:07,352 --> 02:12:09,525
- What happened, Sir?
- Okay. Leave it!

2068
02:12:10,088 --> 02:12:11,499
Saw that lady?

2069
02:12:11,690 --> 02:12:12,964
She is our client!

2070
02:12:13,191 --> 02:12:15,432
She has to come to India for
the first time from France.

2071
02:12:15,527 --> 02:12:17,336
She wanted to go sight seeing.

2072
02:12:17,396 --> 02:12:19,697
But for the past 2 days, I've
been seeing stars instead!

2073
02:12:19,698 --> 02:12:22,008
From today, you have to
take care of her. Okay?

2074
02:12:22,100 --> 02:12:23,170
- Me?
- Yes. You!

2075
02:12:23,368 --> 02:12:25,536
Sir, I have a lot of
work in the office, Sir.

2076
02:12:25,537 --> 02:12:26,914
That's not a problem.

2077
02:12:26,972 --> 02:12:29,077
Now this is your duty. I don't
care how much you spend!

2078
02:12:29,141 --> 02:12:30,085
This my order!

2079
02:12:31,743 --> 02:12:34,383
Sir, she looks really scary!

2080
02:12:35,514 --> 02:12:37,187
She's nothing like you think.

2081
02:12:37,249 --> 02:12:41,356
I've never seen such a
decent lady in my life!

2082
02:12:41,553 --> 02:12:43,387
Your duty begins now!
Okay?

2083
02:12:43,388 --> 02:12:44,388
All the best!

2084
02:12:44,389 --> 02:12:45,456
Phew!

2085
02:12:45,457 --> 02:12:46,731
Such strong punches!

2086
02:12:46,959 --> 02:12:48,370
Is she a lady version of Jackie Chan?

2087
02:12:59,071 --> 02:13:01,073
Hey. I am in some trouble.

2088
02:13:01,540 --> 02:13:02,746
Can you help me out?

2089
02:13:03,008 --> 02:13:03,986
What problem?

2090
02:13:04,042 --> 02:13:05,749
It's not that serious!

2091
02:13:06,278 --> 02:13:08,045
We have to handle a VIP guest.

2092
02:13:08,046 --> 02:13:10,117
I've been trying for 2
days <i>&</i> it's not happening!

2093
02:13:10,215 --> 02:13:11,660
That's all?
I'll be right there!

2094
02:13:51,390 --> 02:13:53,028
Mountains, rivers,
idly, vada, sam bar!

2095
02:13:53,125 --> 02:13:54,536
Small children, their villages!

2096
02:13:57,129 --> 02:13:58,233
We'll see it all!

2097
02:14:28,226 --> 02:14:37,305
The blue sky seemed like
a moist eye, 0' honey..

2098
02:14:37,569 --> 02:14:46,853
The misty clouds seemed like
dreams that swam towards us.

2099
02:14:47,879 --> 02:14:54,091
Are you ready to sing a
couplet for my ears?

2100
02:14:54,186 --> 02:14:59,864
I was lost listening to those
soft gentle verses, repeatedly.

2101
02:15:00,258 --> 02:15:06,766
Is the sky and the earth
covered with flowers?

2102
02:15:08,366 --> 02:15:17,377
The blue sky seemed like
a moist eye, 0' honey..

2103
02:15:17,576 --> 02:15:26,519
The misty clouds seemed like
dreams that swam towards us.

2104
02:15:48,907 --> 02:15:53,907
I wandered through the valleys for the
nectar of that mysterious flower, in vain.

2105
02:16:01,453 --> 02:16:06,453
You came in like a lightning in the
achingly silent cloudy sky.

2106
02:16:14,299 --> 02:16:19,942
Like rains in summer,
Like dreams in sleep,

2107
02:16:20,438 --> 02:16:26,445
Like a blue blanket
on the bed of darkness.

2108
02:16:26,611 --> 02:16:33,153
Did you open the doors with
your soft, gentle hands?

2109
02:16:33,285 --> 02:16:41,796
The blue sky seemed like
a moist eye, 0' honey..

2110
02:16:41,927 --> 02:16:50,870
The misty clouds seemed like
dreams that swam towards us.

2111
02:17:19,698 --> 02:17:24,698
Have you seen that wonderfland
spread with love,

2112
02:17:25,704 --> 02:17:31,211
like the meadows with
flowers that never wither?

2113
02:17:32,310 --> 02:17:37,310
Have you heard the rhythmic
beat of the raging heart?

2114
02:17:45,023 --> 02:17:51,304
Like the midnight moon,
and the summer flies".

2115
02:17:51,363 --> 02:17:57,336
You've become an inseparable
part of my life, day <i>&</i> night!

2116
02:17:57,435 --> 02:18:03,545
Will you come along with me,
singing and dancing?

2117
02:18:03,642 --> 02:18:12,585
The blue sky seemed like
a moist eye, 0' honey..

2118
02:18:12,817 --> 02:18:21,703
The misty clouds seemed like
dreams that swam towards us.

2119
02:18:27,332 --> 02:18:28,470
This is a diamond!

2120
02:18:29,567 --> 02:18:31,001
This watch is also very costly!

2121
02:18:31,002 --> 02:18:32,536
We'll get a good
deal if we sell it!

2122
02:18:32,537 --> 02:18:33,675
You don't have to sell it!

2123
02:18:34,005 --> 02:18:34,983
Let that be.

2124
02:18:35,040 --> 02:18:37,543
But before leaving, she didn't
call usjust to give all this.

2125
02:18:37,609 --> 02:18:38,609
Then?

2126
02:18:38,610 --> 02:18:39,910
That visiting card of yours?

2127
02:18:39,911 --> 02:18:42,482
When she saw it, she thought
I'm running some big company!

2128
02:18:42,681 --> 02:18:43,955
I didn't correct her as well.

2129
02:18:44,015 --> 02:18:45,883
When I printed some
nice visiting cards,

2130
02:18:45,884 --> 02:18:47,386
he abused me like crazy!

2131
02:18:47,485 --> 02:18:48,919
But it worked out now!

2132
02:18:48,920 --> 02:18:50,558
I am taking back all my abuses!

2133
02:18:53,525 --> 02:18:55,027
She does business all over the world.

2134
02:18:55,427 --> 02:18:57,407
Even if we get 0.2%
of her business,

2135
02:18:57,462 --> 02:18:58,566
we'll flourish!

2136
02:18:58,863 --> 02:19:00,464
Not only the cotton from Tiruppur,

2137
02:19:00,465 --> 02:19:01,967
she needs the handmade silk

2138
02:19:02,033 --> 02:19:04,604
woven in the weavers'
village of Tamil Nadu.

2139
02:19:06,504 --> 02:19:07,915
Then shall we try a hand at it?

2140
02:19:09,140 --> 02:19:12,121
Do you have at least a good coin
to toss <i>&</i> see what to do next?

2141
02:19:12,444 --> 02:19:13,718
And you want to try a hand?

2142
02:19:14,446 --> 02:19:16,790
It's like a crow getting mouth
ulcer when the mango ripened!

2143
02:19:22,954 --> 02:19:23,932
I'm leaving.

2144
02:19:26,958 --> 02:19:27,958
And ya.

2145
02:19:27,959 --> 02:19:30,701
Don't dismiss that
lady's offer completely.

2146
02:19:31,796 --> 02:19:33,571
All the businessmen here,

2147
02:19:33,732 --> 02:19:35,405
started from a grass root level.

2148
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:36,978
Think about it.

2149
02:19:56,054 --> 02:19:57,397
Come, son!

2150
02:20:02,694 --> 02:20:04,674
Don't worry, son!
We're here for you, right?

2151
02:20:39,798 --> 02:20:42,404
You woke me up in the middle of
the night to be in silent mode?

2152
02:20:44,869 --> 02:20:46,507
We can't miss this chance, Mushtaq.

2153
02:20:46,638 --> 02:20:47,616
But how?

2154
02:20:48,139 --> 02:20:51,177
The most important thing in an
export business is a solid buyer.

2155
02:20:51,676 --> 02:20:54,020
Since that foreigner is impressed
with you, that's okay!

2156
02:20:54,245 --> 02:20:57,556
But if we have to try it, we need
at least some money to roll, right?

2157
02:20:57,916 --> 02:20:59,589
It's a business worth crores.

2158
02:20:59,884 --> 02:21:02,023
We can get many materials
from the company on debt.

2159
02:21:02,887 --> 02:21:05,197
It's a problem only if we take
it from a single company.

2160
02:21:05,256 --> 02:21:08,499
If we take them from different companies,
we won't owe much to each of them.

2161
02:21:09,060 --> 02:21:11,563
With the contacts I have
now, I can try that out.

2162
02:21:13,064 --> 02:21:15,169
Most of her requirements
are handmade garments.

2163
02:21:16,067 --> 02:21:18,013
Those are made by the
poor weavers here.

2164
02:21:18,670 --> 02:21:21,150
Middle-men are fooling them now
by paying them very little money!

2165
02:21:21,673 --> 02:21:23,607
We should give a higher
price for their effort,

2166
02:21:23,608 --> 02:21:24,908
and make them join us.

2167
02:21:24,909 --> 02:21:28,111
So if there are 1000 weavers, the risk
would be shared among those 1000 people.

2168
02:21:28,112 --> 02:21:30,490
To take that risk, will they trust us?

2169
02:21:30,582 --> 02:21:31,560
They will.

2170
02:21:32,116 --> 02:21:35,097
If they are really convinced that it'll
benefit them, they will trust us.

2171
02:21:35,920 --> 02:21:38,230
<i>Their trust is our first investment.</i>

2172
02:22:09,954 --> 02:22:12,525
Working for many big companies
for all these years,

2173
02:22:12,624 --> 02:22:13,898
what have you all earned?

2174
02:22:15,326 --> 02:22:17,033
We are not very rich people.

2175
02:22:17,795 --> 02:22:21,299
We don't have money to pay you an
advance or buy materials for you.

2176
02:22:21,633 --> 02:22:22,611
But..

2177
02:22:23,768 --> 02:22:25,941
But I have a heart that
realizes the cost of hard work.

2178
02:22:26,804 --> 02:22:29,284
We will pay you double the money
that you're getting right now.

2179
02:22:30,775 --> 02:22:33,949
But unlike other companies,
it won't take 60 or 90 days.

2180
02:22:34,712 --> 02:22:36,817
Within 30 days, we will pay the money.

2181
02:22:38,616 --> 02:22:40,061
But I'll promise you one thing.

2182
02:22:41,185 --> 02:22:42,323
I won't cheat you!

2183
02:22:46,658 --> 02:22:48,035
For me, my father is..

2184
02:22:48,626 --> 02:22:49,604
Like God!

2185
02:22:50,962 --> 02:22:51,940
I swear on him!

2186
02:22:53,164 --> 02:22:54,142
Trust me!

2187
02:22:59,203 --> 02:23:01,149
Son, I trust you!

2188
02:23:01,205 --> 02:23:02,183
I'm ready!

2189
02:23:02,707 --> 02:23:03,707
I'm ready too!

2190
02:23:03,708 --> 02:23:04,686
I'm ready too!

2191
02:23:04,976 --> 02:23:05,976
I'm ready!

2192
02:23:05,977 --> 02:23:06,955
I'm ready too!

2193
02:23:07,045 --> 02:23:08,111
Son, I'm also ready!

2194
02:23:08,112 --> 02:23:09,284
All of us are ready!

2195
02:23:10,315 --> 02:23:14,161
'The time has come'

2196
02:23:14,352 --> 02:23:18,892
'The moment has come'

2197
02:23:22,694 --> 02:23:25,971
'Which is that world beyond the clouds?'

2198
02:23:26,764 --> 02:23:29,973
'Which is that shore
across the blue sea?'

2199
02:23:30,635 --> 02:23:33,878
'The moment when I spread
the wings of my dreams'

2200
02:23:34,839 --> 02:23:38,377
'The moment when I reached
the farthest branch'

2201
02:23:39,110 --> 02:23:42,853
'I will go in search of starry
flowers all over this sky'

2202
02:23:43,147 --> 02:23:47,027
'l will dive into this sea
and collect gold <i>&</i> pearls'

2203
02:25:08,700 --> 02:25:12,341
'Who is there to draw a
boundary in the blue sky?'

2204
02:25:12,804 --> 02:25:16,479
'Every single flower will bloom
on the mango tree in the sky'

2205
02:25:16,841 --> 02:25:20,721
'Who is there to draw a
boundary in the blue sky?'

2206
02:25:20,812 --> 02:25:24,487
'Every single flower will bloom
on the mango tree in the sky'

2207
02:25:40,932 --> 02:25:45,001
'The time has come'

2208
02:25:45,002 --> 02:25:49,041
'The moment has come'

2209
02:26:28,513 --> 02:26:29,924
The manager is calling you.

2210
02:26:29,981 --> 02:26:30,959
Come!

2211
02:26:37,522 --> 02:26:38,500
Sit down.

2212
02:26:43,828 --> 02:26:46,206
The amount has been
credited to your account.

2213
02:26:55,273 --> 02:26:57,310
This is a huge amount!

2214
02:26:59,410 --> 02:27:01,048
- That's not just our money.
- Then?

2215
02:27:01,412 --> 02:27:05,155
We have to share it among many
poor partners who trusted us.

2216
02:27:06,851 --> 02:27:07,829
Hey dude!

2217
02:27:08,186 --> 02:27:09,392
Let me hold it once!

2218
02:27:11,589 --> 02:27:12,567
Just pinch me!

2219
02:27:14,325 --> 02:27:15,360
You believe it now?

2220
02:27:16,093 --> 02:27:17,504
After giving them their shares,

2221
02:27:17,595 --> 02:27:19,199
I have to go somewhere.

2222
02:27:33,477 --> 02:27:34,455
Where were you?

2223
02:27:34,512 --> 02:27:36,492
Couldn't get you on the
phone for the past 2 days!

2224
02:27:36,581 --> 02:27:38,618
And even your friends
didn't know where you were!

2225
02:27:42,553 --> 02:27:44,921
If I ask you something,
don't lie to me!

2226
02:27:44,922 --> 02:27:45,900
What?

2227
02:27:46,457 --> 02:27:47,595
After coming here,

2228
02:27:47,859 --> 02:27:50,169
haven't you missed our
hometown at least once?

2229
02:27:53,130 --> 02:27:54,234
The Thrisshur round,

2230
02:27:54,298 --> 02:27:55,538
your morning walks"

2231
02:27:55,633 --> 02:27:57,271
Friends <i>&</i> townsmen"
None of it?

2232
02:27:59,337 --> 02:28:00,315
Leave all that.

2233
02:28:04,508 --> 02:28:06,647
The place where you <i>&</i> mom
stayed for a long time,

2234
02:28:06,944 --> 02:28:08,218
the place where we grew up,

2235
02:28:08,412 --> 02:28:10,050
Don't you miss that
house you made?

2236
02:28:15,186 --> 02:28:17,632
I can now realize the value
of whatever you made.

2237
02:28:19,523 --> 02:28:21,935
I don't have the smartness to
win back all that we lost.

2238
02:28:23,995 --> 02:28:24,973
But..

2239
02:28:26,130 --> 02:28:27,507
I got back our house alone.

2240
02:28:30,635 --> 02:28:32,171
Initially, that Swamy didn't agree.

2241
02:28:32,637 --> 02:28:34,378
Then I paid him the
price he asked for,

2242
02:28:34,438 --> 02:28:36,247
and got it registered
in your name.

2243
02:28:56,527 --> 02:28:57,597
See you, Sister.

2244
02:28:59,196 --> 02:29:00,539
Careful.
Give it to me.

2245
02:29:02,967 --> 02:29:04,446
Okay then.
Don't forget us.

2246
02:29:05,036 --> 02:29:06,515
Okay dear.
Okay uncle.

2247
02:29:08,439 --> 02:29:11,007
And ya, the company should still
be here even when I return.

2248
02:29:11,008 --> 02:29:11,986
Done!

2249
02:29:12,043 --> 02:29:15,011
But you don't have any objection if I
call a pick-up during emergencies?

2250
02:29:15,012 --> 02:29:16,446
No! Carry it on your
head by yourself!

2251
02:29:16,447 --> 02:29:18,515
You should pay for all
the sins you did, right?

2252
02:29:18,516 --> 02:29:19,494
I'll call you.

2253
02:29:35,433 --> 02:29:37,538
You didn't say bye to that girl?

2254
02:29:39,170 --> 02:29:40,410
Didn't I say bye to everyone?

2255
02:29:40,671 --> 02:29:41,649
Not that.

2256
02:29:42,406 --> 02:29:43,384
I thought.

2257
02:29:44,041 --> 02:29:45,019
Between you..

2258
02:29:45,276 --> 02:29:46,414
What's between us?

2259
02:29:46,711 --> 02:29:49,248
You start imagining things
when people interact closely.

2260
02:29:49,380 --> 02:29:51,189
This is the problem
with your generation.

2261
02:29:51,349 --> 02:29:52,327
But still..

2262
02:29:53,417 --> 02:29:55,226
Dad, we came to stay
here for a while.

2263
02:29:55,519 --> 02:29:57,430
We might have met many
people during that time.

2264
02:29:57,655 --> 02:29:58,963
And now we're going back!

2265
02:29:59,056 --> 02:30:00,763
Now they have their life
and we have our life!

2266
02:30:00,992 --> 02:30:01,970
What else?

2267
02:30:02,259 --> 02:30:03,237
Oh.

2268
02:30:03,527 --> 02:30:06,235
When you made a lot of money
by doing business on your own,

2269
02:30:06,664 --> 02:30:09,110
my son's heart has
become tougher, is it?

2270
02:31:21,872 --> 02:31:22,872
Have it!

2271
02:31:22,873 --> 02:31:24,819
Ask for whatever you want!

2272
02:31:24,875 --> 02:31:26,582
Shall I serve some
butter-milk for you?

2273
02:31:26,710 --> 02:31:28,781
- Butter-milk with Biriyani?
- Oh! It was a Biriyani?

2274
02:31:28,846 --> 02:31:30,519
Leave some space in your tummy!

2275
02:31:30,581 --> 02:31:32,288
Fresh 'Karimeen' is ready!

2276
02:31:32,516 --> 02:31:33,756
Who wants it?

2277
02:31:33,818 --> 02:31:35,218
Give it to your brother-in-law!

2278
02:31:35,219 --> 02:31:36,323
Give it to him first!

2279
02:31:36,687 --> 02:31:38,826
Serve it for Alphie.
It's his favourite.

2280
02:31:41,392 --> 02:31:43,303
Dad, sit down.
I'll serve.

2281
02:31:43,427 --> 02:31:45,668
No. The rice soup for
me will be ready now.

2282
02:31:47,565 --> 02:31:49,340
Ah! It's here.
Keep it there, dear.

2283
02:31:50,301 --> 02:31:53,111
I've been having rice soup
for a long time now. It became a habit!

2284
02:31:59,810 --> 02:32:01,255
To see my children,
sons-in-laws,

2285
02:32:01,312 --> 02:32:03,815
and family members
having lunch together;

2286
02:32:04,281 --> 02:32:05,419
brings me a lot of happiness.

2287
02:32:06,117 --> 02:32:07,187
And that's not just now.

2288
02:32:07,284 --> 02:32:08,262
Always!

2289
02:32:12,890 --> 02:32:17,236
All the advocates are saying that we'll get
a favourable judgement in the land case.

2290
02:32:17,394 --> 02:32:18,634
So what's your plan?

2291
02:32:18,696 --> 02:32:21,267
If you're not interested in
going forward with the project,

2292
02:32:21,332 --> 02:32:23,573
some builders had come to
me, to take it over from you.

2293
02:32:24,568 --> 02:32:26,570
Land value has increased a lot.

2294
02:32:26,737 --> 02:32:29,479
There are people who can blindly
give 15 Iakhs per cent.

2295
02:32:29,807 --> 02:32:32,253
20 acres is not a
small amount, right?

2296
02:32:32,543 --> 02:32:35,752
I'm not going to sell that land. And not
going to build anything over there too!

2297
02:32:39,717 --> 02:32:41,128
If the case is favourable,

2298
02:32:41,252 --> 02:32:45,421
we can sell a small portion to
pay the people we owe money to.

2299
02:32:45,422 --> 02:32:48,130
In the rest of the land, I'm going
to start cultivating paddy!

2300
02:32:48,292 --> 02:32:49,293
Organic farming!

2301
02:32:49,560 --> 02:32:51,233
What madness is this?

2302
02:32:51,562 --> 02:32:53,838
When I fell to the ground
from a huge height,

2303
02:32:53,898 --> 02:32:55,932
many of my lunacies were cured,

2304
02:32:55,933 --> 02:32:57,901
and some new
lunacies have begun!

2305
02:32:57,902 --> 02:32:59,381
Agriculture is one among them.

2306
02:32:59,436 --> 02:33:01,712
If you make paddy in
such an expensive land,

2307
02:33:01,906 --> 02:33:04,785
it won't be worth it even if you
get 10,000 per kilo for that rice.

2308
02:33:04,975 --> 02:33:07,956
Vincent has stopped doing
business only for profits.

2309
02:33:08,412 --> 02:33:09,390
Yes.

2310
02:33:10,648 --> 02:33:12,821
Has the Mayor slept,
waiting for me?

2311
02:33:13,684 --> 02:33:14,958
Dad, we're also leaving.

2312
02:33:15,953 --> 02:33:17,432
- Jomon,
- What is it, uncle?

2313
02:33:17,655 --> 02:33:20,431
What your dad lost, he has
started getting back.

2314
02:33:20,724 --> 02:33:22,260
You just want to go on like this?

2315
02:33:22,493 --> 02:33:24,439
When will you become responsible?

2316
02:33:28,265 --> 02:33:30,370
That's true! When will
you become responsible?

2317
02:33:30,434 --> 02:33:31,538
Since it's so late today,

2318
02:33:31,602 --> 02:33:33,946
I'll become responsible as soon
as I wake up tomorrow morning.

2319
02:33:34,004 --> 02:33:34,982
Then okay!

2320
02:33:37,441 --> 02:33:38,681
- Shall we go?
- Ya.

2321
02:33:42,012 --> 02:33:42,990
Vincent,

2322
02:33:43,480 --> 02:33:45,391
now you've become my old..

2323
02:33:45,449 --> 02:33:46,951
That old Vincent of mine.

2324
02:33:54,491 --> 02:33:55,992
Dad! Why are you sitting there?

2325
02:33:55,993 --> 02:33:56,971
Come!

2326
02:33:57,027 --> 02:33:58,027
You carry on!

2327
02:33:58,028 --> 02:33:59,632
I'm lazy! There
was a gap, right?

2328
02:33:59,697 --> 02:34:00,869
We'll fill that gap.

2329
02:34:00,998 --> 02:34:01,976
My dad? Lazy?

2330
02:34:03,834 --> 02:34:05,313
Come! Stretch your arms!

2331
02:34:05,636 --> 02:34:06,842
Like this.
Backwards.

2332
02:34:12,243 --> 02:34:13,449
Dad, we'll go this way.

2333
02:34:13,577 --> 02:34:14,911
Isn't that our regular route?

2334
02:34:14,912 --> 02:34:16,823
- We need a change in between, right?
- Why?

2335
02:34:16,880 --> 02:34:17,858
Come, dad!

2336
02:34:23,854 --> 02:34:24,832
Greetings Sir!

2337
02:34:24,922 --> 02:34:25,900
Greetings!

2338
02:34:30,361 --> 02:34:31,863
Is this Tiruppur or Thrisshur?

2339
02:34:32,263 --> 02:34:33,674
Are we still in Tiruppur?

2340
02:34:36,867 --> 02:34:40,280
We were a little late when
we reached here last night.

2341
02:34:40,704 --> 02:34:43,810
The taxi driver <i>&</i> lorry driver
didn't take money from us.

2342
02:34:43,907 --> 02:34:46,444
They said that Jomon has
arranged everything!

2343
02:34:50,014 --> 02:34:50,992
Look here!

2344
02:34:51,448 --> 02:34:53,450
So all this was
part of your plan?

2345
02:34:53,517 --> 02:34:54,517
Well..

2346
02:34:54,518 --> 02:34:57,055
Since even you thought that
there was something between us,

2347
02:34:57,288 --> 02:34:58,460
I don't have any problem now!

2348
02:34:58,522 --> 02:34:59,899
Hey!
Stop there!

2349
02:35:00,724 --> 02:35:01,702
I said stop!
