1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,875


3
00:01:34,417 --> 00:01:36,542
'Don't you get it yet?'

4
00:01:38,042 --> 00:01:40,167
How come I haven't seen your dad
in a while?

5
00:01:40,292 --> 00:01:41,292
He passed away.

6
00:01:41,417 --> 00:01:43,125
Passed away?
How sad!

7
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:45,167
He was here just last month for a shave!

8
00:01:45,292 --> 00:01:47,625
Last month?
He passed away a year ago!

9
00:01:48,917 --> 00:01:50,542
Koduku!
You're toast!

10
00:01:54,375 --> 00:01:57,250
Pichai, all the saloons
have upgraded to modern razors.

11
00:01:57,375 --> 00:02:00,292
Why are you
still using this ancient shaving knife?

12
00:02:00,417 --> 00:02:02,042
Please hold it.

13
00:02:02,167 --> 00:02:03,667
What is this?
-A knife.

14
00:02:03,792 --> 00:02:05,667
Barber's knife!
Know who it belongs to?

15
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:07,375
Who?
-My father!

16
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,542
It has been passed down
through generations.

17
00:02:10,667 --> 00:02:12,625
Belonged to my great-great-grandfather.

18
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:16,500
Do you know whose face it shaved first?
-Whose?

19
00:02:16,625 --> 00:02:19,042
The great Mughal emperor Akbar!
-What?

20
00:02:19,167 --> 00:02:20,500
Have you studied geography?

21
00:02:20,625 --> 00:02:22,542
They fail to mention
my ancestor's stories.

22
00:02:22,667 --> 00:02:26,500
Do you know whose face Akbar
used to see every morning?

23
00:02:26,625 --> 00:02:28,292
My great-great-grand dad's!
-Why?

24
00:02:28,417 --> 00:02:30,042
To listen to some political advice!

25
00:02:30,167 --> 00:02:31,750
Sharp mind, not just a sharp knife.

26
00:02:33,417 --> 00:02:35,792
What's with the burping?
-My stomach is rumbling a bit.

27
00:02:35,917 --> 00:02:37,542
Rumble?
I will make you tumble.

28
00:02:37,667 --> 00:02:40,542
Pichai, I can't believe...
-Believe...?

29
00:02:40,667 --> 00:02:42,417
I can't stop myself from believing it!

30
00:02:57,167 --> 00:02:58,167
Sign here!

31
00:03:05,167 --> 00:03:06,667
Pay your respects!

32
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:33,250
Sign!

33
00:03:39,042 --> 00:03:40,250
Pay your respects!

34
00:03:50,417 --> 00:03:52,625
I took the bank loan.

35
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,875
I will repay it.
What do you have to do with it?

36
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,167
Don't beat me!
Why are you beating me?

37
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:05,542
Who are you all?
Where are you from?

38
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:09,625
Hold on, please!

39
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,750
Let him go.
He might die.

40
00:04:32,792 --> 00:04:36,667
Let him go.
Trying to run away, you scoundrel?

41
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:03,917
Just pee!
He will have to let go.

42
00:05:20,417 --> 00:05:23,542
Five... four... three... two...

43
00:05:30,917 --> 00:05:32,500
Let him go!

44
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:33,792
Give it back!

45
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:36,542
Where are you going?
-I'm bored!

46
00:05:36,667 --> 00:05:38,667
If you step out,
you will land in trouble!

47
00:05:38,792 --> 00:05:42,667
Your parole ends today.
You must go to the station this evening.

48
00:05:45,542 --> 00:05:46,792
Don't look up.
Head down.

49
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:16,875
'Intelligence doesn't guarantee success!'

50
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,250
'The ones who succeed...'
-Dad!

51
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:23,667
Shouldn't you be in school?

52
00:06:28,167 --> 00:06:31,125
Subatra, what are you doing here?

53
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:32,292
My dear!

54
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:36,667
Why are you creating a ruckus?

55
00:06:38,542 --> 00:06:41,500
Has the cat got your tongue?
What happened? Say it!

56
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:47,625
Uncle Raghu has eloped
with someone, dad!

57
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:50,417
What?
-He is at the Veerabhadran temple.

58
00:06:50,542 --> 00:06:52,042
He called to let us know.

59
00:06:52,167 --> 00:06:54,875
Veerabhadran temple?
-The one in Tondiarpet.

60
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,500
With whom did he elope?

61
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,167
Subatra, who did your brother
elope with?

62
00:07:04,042 --> 00:07:05,500
Mom!

63
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:07,292
Dad is asking...

64
00:07:07,417 --> 00:07:09,750
...with whom has uncle eloped with?

65
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:11,125
Did I plan their elopement?

66
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:12,750
He ran away on his own.

67
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:15,542
Your dad can't get a wink of sleep
without blaming me.

68
00:07:15,667 --> 00:07:18,667
The torture I undergo
with this damn woman!

69
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:23,792
Koduku, what's with you?

70
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:27,042
What just happened?

71
00:07:27,167 --> 00:07:30,667
Don't insult her in front of everyone
like that!

72
00:07:30,792 --> 00:07:35,917
My dear Koduku,
look how he is lashing out on me!

73
00:07:36,042 --> 00:07:37,917
Am I a pimp to plan their elopement?

74
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:41,292
Don't work my rage!

75
00:07:42,292 --> 00:07:44,792
Yes, my dad works for wage!

76
00:07:44,917 --> 00:07:47,542
It was you who begged him
for my hand in marriage.

77
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:51,667
Look at how he is cursing my father.

78
00:07:51,792 --> 00:07:53,417
Oh, Christ!

79
00:07:53,542 --> 00:07:56,667
Pichai, are you a Christian?
-Get lost!

80
00:07:56,792 --> 00:07:57,917
Koduku, stop it already!

81
00:07:58,042 --> 00:07:59,292
What do you want?

82
00:08:02,667 --> 00:08:04,292
What do I want?

83
00:08:05,417 --> 00:08:06,792
I just want...

84
00:08:06,917 --> 00:08:11,167
...you to hand him the sacred thread,
as his brother-in-law.

85
00:08:11,292 --> 00:08:15,417
I just want to watch him tie the knot.
-Stop it!

86
00:08:15,542 --> 00:08:16,875
I will chop your ears off!

87
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,167
Do you think I'm jobless?

88
00:08:23,167 --> 00:08:25,417
Look! She is well prepared.

89
00:08:25,542 --> 00:08:28,292
You and your brother
are out to humiliate me!

90
00:08:28,417 --> 00:08:30,292
Just take the kids and get back home.

91
00:08:30,417 --> 00:08:32,125
Else I will tonsure your head!

92
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:35,500
It was you who tonsured my brother's head
and pierced his ears.

93
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:38,125
Pichai, do you also do piercings?

94
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:39,667
Just get going!

95
00:08:44,917 --> 00:08:48,250
Let me go!
Why do you care?

96
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:51,000
Come on now!

97
00:08:54,042 --> 00:08:56,917
A girl has to just shed one tear
and all the men will huddle up!

98
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:03,417
Hop on, brother!

99
00:09:03,542 --> 00:09:05,792
You think
you are the epitome of brotherly love?

100
00:09:09,542 --> 00:09:11,667
Brother, shake hands!

101
00:09:11,792 --> 00:09:14,667
They do that in the movies
before setting off on a trip!

102
00:09:14,792 --> 00:09:16,917
I will chop your balls off!
Get going!

103
00:09:17,042 --> 00:09:20,417
Koduku, take care of the shop.
-I will treat like it were my own.

104
00:09:20,542 --> 00:09:23,000
You are going to pay for this!

105
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:49,917
Attend to the customers.

106
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:53,792
What would you like to eat?

107
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:58,417
What would you like, Manga?

108
00:10:01,417 --> 00:10:04,042
Ice creams for everyone!
-Which flavour?

109
00:10:04,167 --> 00:10:06,917
A flavour which will get us
out of here soon.

110
00:10:07,042 --> 00:10:08,167
I want that ice cream.

111
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,000
Butterscotch?
-Scotch!

112
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:19,542
Manga, your parole ends today
and you have to be back at the station.

113
00:10:20,792 --> 00:10:22,792
The lawyer says that the case is airtight.

114
00:10:24,542 --> 00:10:27,000
You got to be in
for a minimum of three years!

115
00:10:28,542 --> 00:10:29,542
I'm talking to you!

116
00:10:40,792 --> 00:10:42,375
Sorry, it was an official call.

117
00:10:49,292 --> 00:10:52,917
Looks like he bit right on target!
-I asked him to pee.

118
00:10:53,042 --> 00:10:55,667
He never listens to me.
-Have an ice cream and chill!

119
00:11:01,542 --> 00:11:03,917
That man is staring at me.

120
00:11:05,292 --> 00:11:06,750
Let's leave this place.

121
00:11:22,167 --> 00:11:26,417
He is still staring at me.
-You come over to this side.

122
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:42,167
Hurry up guys!

123
00:11:46,667 --> 00:11:47,667
I'll go pay the bill.

124
00:12:00,542 --> 00:12:02,625
What the hell are you glaring at?

125
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,875
Who?
-It must be him!

126
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,792
His wife is crying.
This isn't right.

127
00:12:11,917 --> 00:12:14,750
This is so wrong.

128
00:12:18,667 --> 00:12:23,875
You will rot in hell.
God will punish you today!

129
00:12:29,792 --> 00:12:33,042
Why does uncle have to run away
to get married? Why not do it at home?

130
00:12:33,167 --> 00:12:36,292
If he tries such stunts,
I will box his ears!

131
00:12:36,417 --> 00:12:38,417
What?
-Oh just shut up!

132
00:12:38,542 --> 00:12:40,667
I asked him to join the saloon
and learn the job.

133
00:12:40,792 --> 00:12:42,792
He refused and was hell bent on studying.

134
00:12:42,917 --> 00:12:44,667
You said he would
ace in college.

135
00:12:44,792 --> 00:12:46,375
Look what he is up to now!

136
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,542
What?
-Look what he is up to!

137
00:12:48,667 --> 00:12:50,917
Drive carefully!
-Dad! Police.

138
00:12:51,042 --> 00:12:53,417
Stop!

139
00:12:53,542 --> 00:12:55,292
Think you are driving a truck?

140
00:12:55,417 --> 00:12:57,625
How many people in one bike?
Show me your license.

141
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,250
Do you know who she is?
-Who is she?

142
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:01,042
My wife!

143
00:13:01,167 --> 00:13:03,292
My wife, who works at the minister's house.

144
00:13:03,417 --> 00:13:06,167
If she doesn't go,
the whole house would stink up.

145
00:13:06,292 --> 00:13:08,917
I will wait.
You talk to the minister's wife.

146
00:13:09,042 --> 00:13:13,542
What did I even say? You get going!
-Well, go ahead and talk. I'll feel better.

147
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:16,292
Scratching his ass,
when his head is infested with lice!

148
00:13:16,417 --> 00:13:17,542
You go ahead!

149
00:13:19,667 --> 00:13:24,250
What a lousy job!
Everybody is bossing over me!

150
00:13:31,042 --> 00:13:32,292
Where are we going?

151
00:13:37,042 --> 00:13:39,375
Brother...
-I don't know. Just go!

152
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:45,917
Shall we go home?

153
00:13:47,542 --> 00:13:50,125
You have to be at the station at 6 PM.

154
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:53,792
Let's go home, eat and rest.
It will be alright.

155
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:56,667
What will be alright?

156
00:13:56,792 --> 00:13:58,375
Have you ever been to jail?

157
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,875
Ever taken a dump with people watching?

158
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,417
I feel like shooting everyone
I see on the road.

159
00:14:03,542 --> 00:14:05,750
Want to go to the bar?
-Changing the subject, eh?

160
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:07,375
Just snap out of it.

161
00:14:08,417 --> 00:14:11,917
I'm back in prison this evening
and will be out only after three years.

162
00:14:41,667 --> 00:14:42,917
Open the window.

163
00:14:44,167 --> 00:14:46,167
Do you have any brains?
-Brains?

164
00:14:46,292 --> 00:14:48,542
Is this a government property
or your uncle's?

165
00:14:48,667 --> 00:14:50,250
Why the hell are you staring at me?

166
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:52,125
Know who this is?
-Quiet down!

167
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:54,042
We are on a trip
and you are blocking us!

168
00:14:54,167 --> 00:14:57,292
Will you care for my wife if she is hurt?
-Shut up or I'll break your teeth.

169
00:14:57,417 --> 00:14:59,542
Yeah right, you will!
I'll set your ass on fire!

170
00:15:00,792 --> 00:15:02,417
One word
and I'll puncture you!

171
00:15:02,542 --> 00:15:04,542
Do you own a puncture shop?
Is he the owner?

172
00:15:04,667 --> 00:15:06,417
It was an accident. I'm sorry.

173
00:15:06,542 --> 00:15:07,792
Can 'sorry' fix it?

174
00:15:07,917 --> 00:15:09,625
Grab him by his hair
and pull him in!

175
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:12,625
Impossible.
Who do you think you are talking to?

176
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,292
Just shut up and sit!

177
00:15:14,417 --> 00:15:15,917
You don't come out.
I'll come in!

178
00:15:16,042 --> 00:15:18,667
What nerve to speak in front of Manga!
Chop off his arms!

179
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:20,625
I want to go to the hospital.

180
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:23,792
Come out if you have the guts!
Come on!

181
00:15:31,542 --> 00:15:35,000
I'm leaving only cause my kids want me to.
Otherwise you are dead meat!

182
00:15:38,042 --> 00:15:40,417
I'm sorry!

183
00:15:40,542 --> 00:15:44,042
I'm just learning to drive.
I rammed into your car by mistake.

184
00:15:44,167 --> 00:15:45,292
This is my dad's card.

185
00:15:45,417 --> 00:15:47,917
Please feel free to claim
the damage, if any!

186
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,542
Oh brother!

187
00:16:03,667 --> 00:16:05,042
Allah!

188
00:16:05,167 --> 00:16:06,917
God!

189
00:16:07,042 --> 00:16:08,167
Jesus!
-Manga!

190
00:16:14,167 --> 00:16:16,792
Bend over just a bit,
and they will pile you sky-high!

191
00:16:16,917 --> 00:16:20,083
Know how many such folks
your dad has come across, Kotee?

192
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:22,458
If you and your sister
hadn't stopped me today...

193
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:24,583
Would you have fought so many men?
-Then what?

194
00:16:24,708 --> 00:16:26,708
Hold your father's hand. Firmly.
-Dad...

195
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:30,042
Tough as teak!
One punch and it's straight to hell!

196
00:16:30,167 --> 00:16:33,208
If just raising my hand scared him,
imagine if I had gone all the way?

197
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:37,542
This, when one can't find one's butt
with both hands in broad daylight?

198
00:16:37,667 --> 00:16:38,667
This damn woman...

199
00:16:47,542 --> 00:16:49,792
I saw it!
I saw him raising his hand and strike you!

200
00:16:49,917 --> 00:16:51,458
Why the blatant lie?

201
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:54,417
I saw it, Manga.
He raised his hand, but didn't strike you.

202
00:16:54,542 --> 00:16:56,833
Then how is his face busted
and bleeding so hard?

203
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:59,167
Probably from the car that struck us
from behind.

204
00:16:59,292 --> 00:17:01,583
Would such a small strike
wound our boss like this?

205
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:04,208
He hit him!
-You were in the back! Did you see it?

206
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:06,542
You were in the back, too!
How do we believe you?

207
00:17:06,667 --> 00:17:09,167
I saw it, boss!
I saw him lunge and hit you!

208
00:17:09,292 --> 00:17:11,417
You're bleeding hard, boss.

209
00:17:11,542 --> 00:17:13,917
Why are all of you just chatting around?

210
00:17:14,042 --> 00:17:16,083
Get him to a hospital.
His face might swell up.

211
00:17:17,167 --> 00:17:18,958
Sure, "doctor".
You go to the hospital!

212
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:20,917
Bro...
-Did you see it?

213
00:17:21,042 --> 00:17:22,917
I was in the back...
-Then stay there!

214
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:25,917
It already hurts, boss...

215
00:17:26,917 --> 00:17:29,583
Trust me, Manga! He didn't hit you!
-He did hit you!

216
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:31,792
I'm telling you he didn't!
-He did!

217
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:37,583
Did you see him do it?

218
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:39,083
I did!

219
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:41,083
That's two! You?
-I saw him raise his hand!

220
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:45,833
I heard a sound and saw blood.
-Did you see it or not, jackass?

221
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:48,542
Did you see him punch?

222
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:50,833
I saw him raise his hand...

223
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:52,292
That's three!
-Siva!

224
00:17:53,792 --> 00:17:58,458
You should've chopped his hand off
when he raised it against you!

225
00:17:58,583 --> 00:17:59,583
That's four!

226
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:01,833
You're still bleeding, boss!

227
00:18:01,958 --> 00:18:03,208
Burn in hell!

228
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:06,833
I saw it, too!
I saw him hit you!

229
00:18:06,958 --> 00:18:07,958
Five votes!

230
00:18:08,083 --> 00:18:09,458
Don't listen to them, Manga!

231
00:18:09,583 --> 00:18:11,458
Would I let anyone hit you
when I'm around?

232
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,333
He was just showing off.
That's it.

233
00:18:21,542 --> 00:18:22,708
Gauthama...
-Yes, boss?

234
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:25,333
Give me a coin.
-Manga...

235
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:27,167
Let's go back to the factory.

236
00:18:27,292 --> 00:18:28,583
We will.

237
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:29,708
I'll flip it.

238
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:32,667
Tails, we go to the factory.

239
00:18:32,792 --> 00:18:35,583
Heads, we behead him.

240
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:45,458
The knot needs to be tied
within the auspicious time.

241
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:47,208
Our auspicious time has just begun.

242
00:19:00,292 --> 00:19:02,708
'Is everything fine and dandy?'

243
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:04,833
It's Raghu.

244
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:06,833
It's Uncle Raghu, mom!

245
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:11,583
Hey, little brother!
I'm on my way!

246
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:14,208
Your brother-in-law
will hand you the sacred thread!

247
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:15,708
Don't worry about a thing.

248
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:19,708
What?

249
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:23,333
The phone's not working right.
-Uncle?

250
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:28,583
He's asking why we're late.

251
00:19:28,708 --> 00:19:31,708
What?
-He asked why we're late!

252
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:33,333
Why we're late?

253
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:37,583
On our way, a bunch of ruffians
messed with my husband!

254
00:19:37,708 --> 00:19:42,083
He really mopped the floor with them!

255
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:45,542
Don't worry about anything.

256
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:48,333
It was a Rajdoot bike!
Black in colour.

257
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:49,917
That's all we could see.

258
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:54,083
It was going on the left of Royapettah...
towards Gopalapuram!

259
00:20:08,417 --> 00:20:10,167
Bro!

260
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:13,208
Did you see a family go by on a bike?

261
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:15,667
How many people?
-Four!

262
00:20:15,792 --> 00:20:17,958
What bike was it?
-Rajdoot!

263
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:19,917
What colour was it?
-Black!

264
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:22,542
Which year did that model come out?

265
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:27,083
My mind is fried by your questions.
Ask more and I'll rip your tongue out!

266
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:29,542
Go ahead! Ask!

267
00:20:32,792 --> 00:20:34,083
Still haven't given up, eh?

268
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:38,583
I don't have the time right now.
If I did, you'd all be running butt naked!

269
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:54,333
TCX-7298.

270
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:56,333
Yes, a Rajdoot bike.

271
00:20:57,333 --> 00:20:58,417
Give me the address!

272
00:21:11,542 --> 00:21:13,208
This is a very special hand.

273
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:15,042
Just seeing it brings one luck!

274
00:21:15,167 --> 00:21:16,583
Hey! Are you Mani?

275
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:18,167
Astrologer Sigamani.

276
00:21:18,292 --> 00:21:20,583
Dear astrologer,
your auspicious time is up!

277
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:33,917
Where's your bike?
-I sold it!

278
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:35,208
To whom?
-My friend.

279
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:36,583
What's his name?
-Pichai!

280
00:21:36,708 --> 00:21:37,958
What's his job?
-Grooming!

281
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:39,458
Talk properly!
-He cuts hair!

282
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:47,333
What's his address?

283
00:21:51,417 --> 00:21:53,583
Why are you looking up?
-I'm thinking...

284
00:21:53,708 --> 00:21:55,583
11/6, Baba Street!

285
00:21:55,708 --> 00:21:59,208
He'll never change, sir.
Still stuck in the past.

286
00:21:59,333 --> 00:22:03,542
Who'll come by here,
if one cuts like how they did in the 80s?

287
00:22:03,667 --> 00:22:07,458
Nowadays, only hip styles like
"Jubilee Cutting", "Swine Cutting"...

288
00:22:07,583 --> 00:22:13,708
..."Monkey Style" and "Mad Max"
goes well with the customers.

289
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:18,917
I have tried telling him,
but his brain refuses to leave the past.

290
00:22:19,042 --> 00:22:21,083
That's why I intend to go to America.

291
00:22:21,208 --> 00:22:23,208
To America, huh?
-Yes, sir!

292
00:22:23,333 --> 00:22:25,583
They need someone
to cut Michael Jackson's hair.

293
00:22:27,708 --> 00:22:28,708
Come in, sir!

294
00:22:28,833 --> 00:22:29,958
Haircut or shave?

295
00:23:03,833 --> 00:23:04,958
How much for a garland?

296
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:08,708
What's it for?
-What else? For wearing around the neck.

297
00:23:08,833 --> 00:23:10,167
Sorry. I wasn't aware.

298
00:23:11,333 --> 00:23:13,583
Is this new,
or have you just sprinkled water on it?

299
00:23:13,708 --> 00:23:16,833
No garland for you! Buy it somewhere else!
-Alright.

300
00:23:16,958 --> 00:23:20,167
Make it fast!
We don't have a lot of time!

301
00:23:20,292 --> 00:23:21,958
How much for the garland?

302
00:23:23,667 --> 00:23:28,083
Will anyone take a pregnant woman
to a funeral?

303
00:23:28,208 --> 00:23:30,083
Is the lord of death your first cousin?

304
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:31,708
Stop saying ominous things!

305
00:23:31,833 --> 00:23:33,333
Isn't this a wedding garland?

306
00:23:33,458 --> 00:23:36,958
You damn fool!
These are funeral wreaths!

307
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:39,708
Go that side!
You'll find wedding garlands there.

308
00:23:40,708 --> 00:23:43,083
You buy garlands
for wearing around the neck, eh?

309
00:23:43,208 --> 00:23:46,083
Slipped my mind...
-Careful. Someone might put one around you.

310
00:23:46,208 --> 00:23:48,292
Just get a garland
from one of these places!

311
00:23:48,417 --> 00:23:50,333
These are old garlands! I'll get a new one.

312
00:23:51,708 --> 00:23:52,708
Yes, Koduku?

313
00:23:52,833 --> 00:23:55,917
Someone has come looking for us!

314
00:23:56,042 --> 00:23:58,458
Looking for us?
Tell them to come back in the evening.

315
00:23:58,583 --> 00:24:01,583
I don't think I can hold on for that long!

316
00:24:01,708 --> 00:24:03,708
What are you saying?
Such a customer for us?

317
00:24:03,833 --> 00:24:06,458
They don't seem like our customers!

318
00:24:06,583 --> 00:24:09,333
Then what?
-They seem more like our creditors!

319
00:24:09,458 --> 00:24:12,542
Creditors often drop by.
Why let that rattle you?

320
00:24:12,667 --> 00:24:15,958
And to think I was planning to give you
your own saloon at Kannamapet.

321
00:24:16,083 --> 00:24:18,708
Just handle it. You have a mouth, right?
Just a minute.

322
00:24:18,833 --> 00:24:21,458
How much for this garland?
-250 rupees.

323
00:24:21,583 --> 00:24:23,083
250 rupees for this garland?

324
00:24:23,208 --> 00:24:25,833
Do you know what I do?
I run a flower business in Koyambedu!

325
00:24:25,958 --> 00:24:28,083
Don't give me that crap.
-Koyambedu, eh?

326
00:24:28,208 --> 00:24:30,458
I go there every day.
I've never seen you there.

327
00:24:30,583 --> 00:24:32,833
Seen the six shops in the left of the road?
-Yes.

328
00:24:32,958 --> 00:24:34,833
They all belong to me!
-Really?

329
00:24:34,958 --> 00:24:37,083
Then name your price and take it!

330
00:24:37,208 --> 00:24:39,583
Hold on, Koduku. I'll call you back, okay?

331
00:24:39,708 --> 00:24:41,958
Just a minute, brother!

332
00:24:42,083 --> 00:24:43,458
Oh My Goodness!

333
00:25:08,042 --> 00:25:09,458
Kotee, put it on radio mode.

334
00:25:10,833 --> 00:25:13,083
Is there no speaker?
-The speaker plays the radio!

335
00:25:14,083 --> 00:25:17,208
Stop calling, Koduku!
I'm out on an auspicious task.

336
00:25:17,333 --> 00:25:18,708
How many people?
-Six or seven.

337
00:25:18,833 --> 00:25:20,917
Haircut or shave?
-Shave!

338
00:25:21,042 --> 00:25:24,417
Shave, huh?
-I can't take it anymore!

339
00:25:24,542 --> 00:25:28,083
Why? What was that sound?
-It's coming!

340
00:25:28,208 --> 00:25:31,833
Tell the customer you need to take a dump.
Why call me for this?

341
00:25:31,958 --> 00:25:34,208
What the hell is it, man?

342
00:25:38,792 --> 00:25:40,417
It's bleeding!

343
00:25:40,542 --> 00:25:43,708
My goodness. It might be piles!
Take a pill. You'll feel better.

344
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:46,708
I have another call. Talk to you later.
-Hold on!

345
00:25:47,833 --> 00:25:53,208
Did you see that, sir?
Did he listen to a single word I said?

346
00:25:58,583 --> 00:26:00,458
The phone's ringing, Kotee.
See who it is.

347
00:26:01,792 --> 00:26:03,667
It's Uncle Mani, dad!

348
00:26:03,792 --> 00:26:05,083
That astrologer?
-Yes, dad.

349
00:26:05,208 --> 00:26:07,792
I didn't give him this month's installment
for the bike!

350
00:26:07,917 --> 00:26:10,083
Here!
Just talk to him!

351
00:26:11,417 --> 00:26:12,958
Listen to me carefully, Pichai.

352
00:26:13,083 --> 00:26:14,417
A mob came by looking for you.

353
00:26:14,542 --> 00:26:16,667
They asked for your address
and they beat me up.

354
00:26:16,792 --> 00:26:20,458
Since I can't lie on Fridays,
I gave them the address to your shop.

355
00:26:20,583 --> 00:26:22,042
They're very angry, man.

356
00:26:22,167 --> 00:26:24,458
I just saw your horoscope.
It looks very bleak.

357
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:29,042
I don't know what you plan to do.
Just go into hiding for two days, okay?

358
00:26:32,292 --> 00:26:35,208
I know this is a shock to you.
I understand.

359
00:26:35,333 --> 00:26:38,333
Recite "Kantha Sasti Kavasam"
7,000 times. Be nightfall by then.

360
00:26:38,458 --> 00:26:41,958
Once the day breaks, all will be well.
Stay strong. I'm hanging up now.

361
00:26:54,708 --> 00:26:57,042
It stopped!
-Good riddance!

362
00:27:04,292 --> 00:27:05,708
Hey Kotee, see who's calling.

363
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:08,917
It's Uncle Koduku!
-Put the phone on radio.

364
00:27:09,042 --> 00:27:11,458
I need to put Koduku in his place!

365
00:27:11,583 --> 00:27:12,958
Hey Koduku...

366
00:27:13,083 --> 00:27:16,042
Hey, who is this?
Who the hell is this?

367
00:27:27,792 --> 00:27:29,917
Stop it!
Why are you abusing me like this?

368
00:27:45,458 --> 00:27:48,083
Are you done talking?
Now it's my turn.

369
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:50,708
You questioned my manhood
and abused me before my kids.

370
00:27:50,833 --> 00:27:52,417
I'll show you who's boss!

371
00:27:52,542 --> 00:27:54,333
Come over here!
-Yes, sir?

372
00:27:54,458 --> 00:27:56,708
Is there a place nearby
where ten guys can be beat up?

373
00:27:56,833 --> 00:27:58,833
What kind of place?
-Park! Is there one here?

374
00:27:58,958 --> 00:28:01,208
There's a botanical garden.
-Go!

375
00:28:01,333 --> 00:28:03,667
I'll be at the entrance
of the botanical garden!

376
00:28:03,792 --> 00:28:05,958
If you're not an illegitimate son,
come on over!

377
00:28:06,083 --> 00:28:08,583
Yes, I'll be right there.
Come on over!

378
00:28:08,708 --> 00:28:10,458
Get off, kiddo.
-Dad...

379
00:28:10,583 --> 00:28:11,583
Let's go, dad.

380
00:28:12,833 --> 00:28:14,708
Why are you stopping?

381
00:28:14,833 --> 00:28:19,167
Mom, dad is going to fight some ruffians!
-Who? Him?

382
00:28:19,292 --> 00:28:22,333
Just slamming a door
makes him wet his pants!

383
00:28:22,458 --> 00:28:24,333
This is a matter of honour!

384
00:28:24,458 --> 00:28:27,458
I'm going over to prove myself.
Shut up and stay here!

385
00:28:27,583 --> 00:28:28,958
Just stay here, alright?

386
00:28:29,083 --> 00:28:31,458
My brother's waiting for us!

387
00:28:33,083 --> 00:28:35,583
Instead of him,
I should have married a donkey!

388
00:28:44,583 --> 00:28:45,583
Stop the car.

389
00:29:20,833 --> 00:29:23,333
Please don't do this, Manga. Let's go home.
-Stay here!

390
00:29:49,417 --> 00:29:50,417
Be fair!

391
00:29:56,958 --> 00:29:58,833
Concealed your stick around paper, huh?

392
00:30:07,417 --> 00:30:09,542
Think you're the only one with it?
I got it, too!

393
00:30:31,208 --> 00:30:32,958
He seems to be a wizard!
-Get lost!

394
00:30:58,708 --> 00:31:00,792
Go this side!
You go that side!

395
00:31:38,292 --> 00:31:39,417
Hey, did you see him?

396
00:31:40,417 --> 00:31:41,458
Did you see him?

397
00:32:49,458 --> 00:32:52,708
You jackass!
Couldn't you have kept your mouth shut?

398
00:32:52,833 --> 00:32:54,958
Think you're a superstar?
Look what happened!

399
00:32:55,083 --> 00:32:57,583
Had I known about this,
I wouldn't have left my shop!

400
00:32:57,708 --> 00:32:59,208
Screw up and then moan about it!

401
00:32:59,333 --> 00:33:00,667
What do I do, sir?

402
00:33:00,792 --> 00:33:04,292
Get your grave set at Kannamapet cemetery!
-Please help me!

403
00:33:04,417 --> 00:33:06,333
Please convince them to back off.

404
00:33:06,458 --> 00:33:08,542
Manga is a lunatic.

405
00:33:08,667 --> 00:33:11,833
He's really pissed off.
He's won't rest until he severs your limbs!

406
00:33:14,333 --> 00:33:17,167
What's the point of begging me now?
-I have a wife and two kids.

407
00:33:17,292 --> 00:33:19,083
Stay in hiding until six this evening.

408
00:33:19,208 --> 00:33:21,333
His parole ends at six,
and he'll be back in jail.

409
00:33:21,458 --> 00:33:24,958
Until then, run and hide.
Otherwise, he will kill you. Now go!

410
00:33:31,333 --> 00:33:33,333
Dear!

411
00:33:33,458 --> 00:33:35,250
Dear!

412
00:33:35,375 --> 00:33:37,875
Hurry up!
The auspicious time is running out!

413
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,125
Call him.
-Dad! Please come out.

414
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:48,375
Is it fair to be spending time in the loo
instead of attending the wedding?

415
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:49,958
Can't you hold it in for a while?

416
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:54,708
Dear?

417
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:57,500
What happened?

418
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:06,375
Getting married to this leaky butt
has stunk up my life!

419
00:34:07,958 --> 00:34:12,000
Siva, I've been trying to reach Pichai.
He hasn't answered. Did he call you?

420
00:34:12,125 --> 00:34:14,625
Nope.
No one called.

421
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:16,458
Let me know if you hear from him.

422
00:34:16,583 --> 00:34:17,750
I will.

423
00:34:19,083 --> 00:34:21,583
Bro, I need to pee.

424
00:34:21,708 --> 00:34:26,250
At least you get to pee!
But I might never will!

425
00:34:42,625 --> 00:34:45,000
Get off the bike!
She and her antics!

426
00:35:11,375 --> 00:35:13,125
Could your father even buy me a bike?

427
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:16,458
I told you we should've taken an auto
instead of this damn bike.

428
00:35:16,583 --> 00:35:19,000
I was talking about your father!

429
00:35:19,125 --> 00:35:22,125
Even I wanted to take my father along
to the wedding.

430
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:24,125
Why must a tree climber
scratch his ass?

431
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:26,458
That's what the audience would think.
-Ok. Go on.

432
00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:28,458
But, that's where the plot begins.

433
00:35:28,583 --> 00:35:31,875
The plot begins with a twist.
-Uncle Poochi!

434
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,750
Pichai!
-What are you doing here?

435
00:35:33,875 --> 00:35:36,625
He's an assistant director trying to pitch
a story to AVM.

436
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:39,375
Our family has been grooming AVM
for generations.

437
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:40,875
So he wants me to put in a word.

438
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,125
That is his story!
Tell me yours.

439
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:45,125
Problems are falling like bricks on me!

440
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:47,375
So what if bricks fall?
Use them to build a house.

441
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:49,125
Don't yap without knowing the facts!

442
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:51,833
Do you know who I am?
Do you know who my father is?

443
00:35:51,958 --> 00:35:53,875
Do you know who my grandfather was?

444
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,875
When Alexander came to India,
our forefathers sorted out his problems.

445
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,375
You too?

446
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,208
This drivel is why I'm on the run!

447
00:36:02,333 --> 00:36:04,458
Run my boy!
Till your last breath.

448
00:36:04,583 --> 00:36:05,625
Uncle!

449
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:07,750
Stop shaking your head
and get to the point.

450
00:36:12,333 --> 00:36:13,750
Bro, it's Pichai.
-Pull over!

451
00:36:15,875 --> 00:36:16,875
Put it on speaker!

452
00:36:19,083 --> 00:36:21,625
Hello, this is Poochi here.
-Poochi?

453
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:23,625
I'm Pichai's distant relative.

454
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:25,708
Where is Pichai?
-He is right here.

455
00:36:25,833 --> 00:36:28,875
If you come by,
we can resolve this amicably.

456
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,958
It is just a fart in a windstorm.

457
00:36:32,083 --> 00:36:35,125
Why this proverb now?
-Only then will they realize my worth!

458
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:39,500
Where are you?
-Opposite Mandaveli bus stand.

459
00:36:41,375 --> 00:36:44,125
Uncle Poochi! How have you been?
-He is doing just fine!

460
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:45,875
Wait here with the kids.
I'll be back.

461
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,583
What?
Just tell me that you can't make it.

462
00:36:48,708 --> 00:36:51,458
We can't let the auspicious time pass.

463
00:36:51,583 --> 00:36:54,083
Get me an auto rickshaw
and we'll be on our way.

464
00:36:54,208 --> 00:36:57,125
You hapless lady!
As if I don't have enough trouble already.

465
00:36:57,250 --> 00:36:58,875
Pichai, why are you yelling?

466
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,375
Talk softly.
-Oh please. She is stone deaf.

467
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:05,083
Listen, I'm stepping out with him.
Go and have some tea!

468
00:37:05,208 --> 00:37:08,750
Pee?
-Not pee, have tea!

469
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:14,250
Bring Uncle Poochi along.
Let him bless the bride and groom.

470
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:34,625
Greetings, sir.
I'm Poochi, Pichai's uncle.

471
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:35,750
Where is he?

472
00:37:36,875 --> 00:37:40,500
Was it you who he bashed up?
Sorry, he didn't mean to.

473
00:37:40,625 --> 00:37:43,250
When the door is short,
shouldn't we bend down and walk?

474
00:37:43,375 --> 00:37:46,250
Let bygones be bygones.
You should have ignored it.

475
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:52,375
I'll ask him to give you free shaves
for a year and a half.

476
00:37:53,625 --> 00:37:56,958
The wise say,
"If one slaps you, turn the other cheek!"

477
00:37:57,083 --> 00:37:58,625
You are all wise.

478
00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:00,375
Where are you from, sir?

479
00:38:10,833 --> 00:38:11,833
Hello!

480
00:38:58,458 --> 00:39:03,125
Sir, please spare me.
I didn't mean it. Forgive me!

481
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,500
I didn't mean to do it.
I'm going to have a baby.

482
00:39:10,625 --> 00:39:12,375
I want to see my child.

483
00:39:14,375 --> 00:39:16,458
Please don't!

484
00:39:16,583 --> 00:39:17,583
Please let me go.

485
00:39:58,625 --> 00:40:04,000
For three years, she used to kick my bosom
while drinking milk.

486
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:10,625
Now she has kicked us all away!

487
00:40:13,625 --> 00:40:15,875
I asked you to keep an eye on her.

488
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,583
You shut me up!
You said she knows everything.

489
00:40:19,708 --> 00:40:23,000
Stop it, sis! What did he do?
He was affectionate! Is that wrong?

490
00:40:23,125 --> 00:40:25,083
Don't say a word!

491
00:40:26,625 --> 00:40:27,875
What were you doing?

492
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,875
You were the one who took her to college.

493
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Why didn't you keep tabs
on who she mingled with? You wretch!

494
00:40:37,125 --> 00:40:39,375
Which son of a hag did she elope with?

495
00:40:41,375 --> 00:40:43,500
Hurry up!

496
00:40:43,625 --> 00:40:46,375
Where did she go?
Who the hell did she go with?

497
00:40:47,375 --> 00:40:52,125
God, may the legs of the man who took her
from me be rendered useless!

498
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:55,125
May a truck run over his legs
and keep him on crutches for life!

499
00:40:55,250 --> 00:40:58,250
Only then will I be at peace!

500
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:04,750
How do we get to Veerabhadran temple?
-Take a left and go straight.

501
00:41:11,625 --> 00:41:13,000
Step down carefully.

502
00:41:16,958 --> 00:41:17,958
Get down.

503
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,000
All of you wait in the park for me.
I will check on the situation.

504
00:41:22,125 --> 00:41:23,750
Make it fast.
-Alright, get going.

505
00:41:25,125 --> 00:41:26,500
Let's go.

506
00:41:36,208 --> 00:41:38,625
Hey Lavi, check this out!
Let's go!

507
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:35,708
Who is next?
-Priyadarshini and Rajendran.

508
00:42:35,833 --> 00:42:36,875
Tell them to hurry!

509
00:42:38,375 --> 00:42:41,458
Priyadarshini and Rajendran!
Please hurry up. It's time.

510
00:42:41,583 --> 00:42:43,833
The priest is waiting for you.
-They have signed.

511
00:42:43,958 --> 00:42:45,875
Number 27.
Please go inside and check.

512
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:49,250
The rudeness of these guys!

513
00:42:54,125 --> 00:42:56,125
What is your name?
-Shwetha. Why do you ask?

514
00:43:12,625 --> 00:43:14,250
Your name?
-Gayathri.

515
00:43:21,708 --> 00:43:22,875
Your name?
-Pooja.

516
00:43:29,625 --> 00:43:31,125
Your name?
-Viji.

517
00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:32,333
What?
-Vijayalakshmi.

518
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,750
Are you the groom?
What is your name?

519
00:43:41,875 --> 00:43:42,875
Ravikumar, sir.

520
00:43:44,125 --> 00:43:45,625
And yours?
-Sushila.

521
00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:47,708
Secret wedding?
-Why do you care?

522
00:43:53,208 --> 00:43:59,250
Gita, I have my doubts.
Keep an eye on these two.

523
00:43:59,375 --> 00:44:01,458
If they even move a muscle, bash them.
-Got it.

524
00:44:22,208 --> 00:44:24,250
Ambrish, can you fetch some water?

525
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Raghu, I think they are my dad's henchmen.

526
00:44:31,125 --> 00:44:32,458
I think so too.

527
00:44:32,583 --> 00:44:33,583
What do we do?

528
00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:36,250
Let me think.

529
00:45:15,625 --> 00:45:18,250
Hey! Why are you sitting next to the bride?
-Who is he?

530
00:45:18,375 --> 00:45:20,750
Groom.
-Groom, he says!

531
00:45:20,875 --> 00:45:22,125
I meant groom's side!

532
00:45:22,250 --> 00:45:24,000
What are you yapping?
I'm the groom.

533
00:45:24,125 --> 00:45:25,375
How could you forget me?

534
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:27,583
How many porn films
have we watched together?

535
00:45:27,708 --> 00:45:30,833
What? You watch porn?
-I don't even know him!

536
00:45:30,958 --> 00:45:34,625
Tell the truth!
Didn't you watch porn movies with him?

537
00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:38,333
Spill the beans!
Is this your only vice?

538
00:45:38,458 --> 00:45:41,000
Don't you lie to me!
-No. Please believe me.

539
00:45:55,833 --> 00:45:57,583
We will take them down.

540
00:46:00,625 --> 00:46:03,000
Why are you falling for every woman?

541
00:46:08,083 --> 00:46:09,750
He is not an equal.
Let him go.

542
00:46:09,875 --> 00:46:13,625
I need to kill Pichai.
-You will be in jail for another 5 years.

543
00:46:13,750 --> 00:46:16,000
I don't mind being in for another 10 years.
-Why?

544
00:46:16,125 --> 00:46:19,125
I'm a snake.
I cannot not bite!

545
00:46:19,250 --> 00:46:23,000
Siva called. Pichai’s brother-in-law
is handicapped. He's the guy we saw inside!

546
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:34,250
What are you guys doing here?
-They escaped without a trace!

547
00:46:42,750 --> 00:46:44,500
Why are they running around?
-No idea.

548
00:46:44,625 --> 00:46:46,750
Kayal, my dear!

549
00:46:47,875 --> 00:46:49,250
Damn!
It's not her!

550
00:46:50,750 --> 00:46:53,500
Have you seen a girl named Kayal?

551
00:46:53,625 --> 00:46:54,958
They haven't seen her.

552
00:46:58,625 --> 00:47:03,208
He has promised that he won't watch
such stuff ever again. Let's pardon him.

553
00:47:03,333 --> 00:47:05,875
Get away.
Why are you trying to kiss me?

554
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,250
As if you are some damsel to be kissed!

555
00:47:09,375 --> 00:47:12,875
Have you seen my daughter Kayal?
-I'm looking for a boy myself!

556
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,750
Has your boy eloped as well?
-Yours too? Run along now!

557
00:47:17,750 --> 00:47:19,750
Did you see a guy in a wheelchair?

558
00:47:19,875 --> 00:47:22,125
Manga, we have had a rough day
since morning.

559
00:47:22,250 --> 00:47:26,250
We are at a temple. Things will get better.
Let's go to the factory.

560
00:47:26,375 --> 00:47:27,750
Hurry up!

561
00:47:27,875 --> 00:47:29,750
Can't you shut your trap?

562
00:47:29,875 --> 00:47:31,250
I'll not stop until I kill him.

563
00:47:31,375 --> 00:47:32,875
Don't lobby around.

564
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:45,625
Where the hell are you?
Collecting kickbacks?

565
00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:50,125
My daughter is nowhere to be found.
If I don't find my daughter...

566
00:47:50,250 --> 00:47:52,708
I asked you to shadow them
and you guys screwed up!

567
00:47:52,833 --> 00:47:55,875
I told you to not to send her to college.

568
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,500
Did you ever listen to my words?

569
00:47:57,625 --> 00:48:00,500
I sent her to college to ensure
she won't become a dunce like you!

570
00:48:00,625 --> 00:48:03,958
If I don't catch him,
I will skin you alive.

571
00:48:04,958 --> 00:48:07,750
Stop talking and find them.
-I'm not going to stop calling you.

572
00:48:07,875 --> 00:48:10,458
You just wait.
Come home. I will whip your...

573
00:48:10,583 --> 00:48:13,625
Is this the place where eloped couples
get married? Or is it nearby?

574
00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:16,333
Are there other such places nearby?
-I don't know.

575
00:48:16,458 --> 00:48:19,625
Let me find this guy
and we will go together.

576
00:48:21,333 --> 00:48:23,708
Brother, I have an idea.

577
00:48:26,083 --> 00:48:29,000
There he is!
Pichai!

578
00:48:29,125 --> 00:48:31,583
His name is Raghu.
He is a senior in college.

579
00:48:31,708 --> 00:48:34,250
He has only a sister.
Her husband's name is Pichai!

580
00:48:34,375 --> 00:48:35,625
What does he do?
-A barber.

581
00:48:35,750 --> 00:48:36,958
Oh Lord!

582
00:48:40,625 --> 00:48:42,375
Have you seen Pichai, the barber?
-No!

583
00:48:44,875 --> 00:48:46,375
I have. There he is!
-Where?

584
00:48:47,125 --> 00:48:48,750
Slit his throat!

585
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,333
Listen to me.
You don't need to go to that wedding!

586
00:49:13,458 --> 00:49:16,000
You want to buy a necklace
just to wear for one wedding?

587
00:49:16,125 --> 00:49:17,875
Stop playing around!

588
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,625
Listen to me!
Next month, I'll buy you a chain...

589
00:49:24,208 --> 00:49:25,625
Why did you leave us behind?

590
00:49:25,750 --> 00:49:28,000
I had to take a call from the station.

591
00:49:28,125 --> 00:49:30,833
Don't worry about a thing.
I'll handle it.

592
00:49:30,958 --> 00:49:33,500
Pichai may be a sharp knife,
but I am a sword!

593
00:49:33,625 --> 00:49:37,500
Rather than going to Saidapet or Teynampet,
he went to Tondiarpet for this wedding.

594
00:49:37,625 --> 00:49:39,375
I know all the registrars in this area.

595
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:42,250
He will have to conduct the wedding
in a nearby temple.

596
00:49:42,375 --> 00:49:45,125
An officer will give him a sheet,
which isn't worth crap!

597
00:49:45,250 --> 00:49:48,833
Tear it up, rip out the sacred thread
and drag your daughter back home.

598
00:49:48,958 --> 00:49:51,000
I'll break his legs and throw him in jail.

599
00:49:51,125 --> 00:49:52,625
What do you say?
-My friend...

600
00:49:53,833 --> 00:49:56,083
That prick screwed over all of us.

601
00:49:56,208 --> 00:49:57,333
How far can he get away?

602
00:49:57,458 --> 00:49:59,583
I have the whole of North Madras covered.

603
00:49:59,708 --> 00:50:01,750
And we also have your guys.

604
00:50:01,875 --> 00:50:04,750
We even have
Inspector Arul Anand's support.

605
00:50:04,875 --> 00:50:07,375
Wherever we see him,
we take him down. Hard.

606
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:10,083
I want my daughter back.
You want Pichai.

607
00:50:10,208 --> 00:50:13,125
We'll all team up.
When he's within our sights, we end him.

608
00:50:13,250 --> 00:50:15,458
If you come across my daughter,
let me know.

609
00:50:15,583 --> 00:50:17,458
If I nab that fox,
I will let you know.

610
00:50:17,583 --> 00:50:20,750
Hey Arul Anand! Find my daughter
and I'll pay you one lakh rupees!

611
00:50:20,875 --> 00:50:24,833
Find Pichai. He'll pay you one lakh rupees.
Is that fine?

612
00:50:24,958 --> 00:50:26,125
I'll give you five lakhs!

613
00:50:27,625 --> 00:50:29,125
That guy is a total wimp!

614
00:50:29,250 --> 00:50:32,250
In an hour, he'll be licking your shoes.
You have my word. Let's go!

615
00:50:34,375 --> 00:50:36,875
Where are you, man?
Just listen to me!

616
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:41,000
This won't work out.
I saw her father. A real scary guy!

617
00:50:41,125 --> 00:50:44,833
Just send that girl home
and come back to us. Listen to me, Raghu!

618
00:50:44,958 --> 00:50:47,000
It's not right.
Kayal trusts me with her life.

619
00:50:47,125 --> 00:50:49,500
We are halfway there.
We can't stop now!

620
00:50:49,625 --> 00:50:52,458
You do whatever you want. I don't care.
Why drag me into this?

621
00:50:52,583 --> 00:50:54,625
I was merrily going about
with my livelihood.

622
00:50:54,750 --> 00:50:57,958
Look who's on my prowl!
He's hell bent on chopping my hand!

623
00:50:58,083 --> 00:51:00,333
Please...
-But she trusts me with her life!

624
00:51:00,458 --> 00:51:01,875
Please listen to me.

625
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
If you fall in a knife's path,
it will cut you.

626
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,458
Just buy her a cup of tea in the street
and run away!

627
00:51:08,583 --> 00:51:09,833
That isn't right.

628
00:51:09,958 --> 00:51:12,750
The lord will show her the way.

629
00:51:13,875 --> 00:51:16,125
They'll hack you into pieces, man!
-Let them!

630
00:51:16,250 --> 00:51:17,875
Just listen to me!

631
00:51:26,208 --> 00:51:28,333
Oh, so that's what you said!
Alright then!

632
00:51:28,458 --> 00:51:31,458
You'll head over there?
Very well! I'll do the same.

633
00:51:33,625 --> 00:51:35,875
Subatra, let's go to our hometown!

634
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,125
What about Raghu?
-He said he'll come there directly!

635
00:51:39,250 --> 00:51:42,125
He said he'll get married
in the temple of our family deity.

636
00:51:42,250 --> 00:51:43,375
Really?

637
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:46,500
Oh Raghu,
my sweet little darling of a brother!

638
00:51:46,625 --> 00:51:48,500
Isn't this the south side?
-Yes.

639
00:51:48,625 --> 00:51:50,958
Oh Lord Sangili Karuppan...

640
00:51:51,083 --> 00:51:53,750
...your children will seek your blessings
tomorrow!

641
00:51:53,875 --> 00:51:56,500
Oh dear gods,
please bestow a good life upon them!

642
00:51:56,625 --> 00:51:58,125
Hey, Koteeswara?
-Yes?

643
00:51:58,250 --> 00:52:01,875
Half-ticket for you, right?
-Even my little sister needs a full ticket!

644
00:52:03,583 --> 00:52:05,875
If a full ticket costs 320 rupees,
how much is four?

645
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,500
1,280 rupees, dad!

646
00:52:09,333 --> 00:52:10,875
Do you have any money?

647
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,625
Money?
-Yes.

648
00:52:16,333 --> 00:52:18,125
I have 70 rupees.

649
00:52:18,250 --> 00:52:19,833
70 rupees?
Get out of here!

650
00:52:28,208 --> 00:52:31,250
Subi, please give me your chain.

651
00:52:31,375 --> 00:52:32,875
My jewelry? Why?

652
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,458
I don't have enough cash.

653
00:52:34,583 --> 00:52:37,000
Only by pawning something, can we go home.
Mustn't we?

654
00:52:37,125 --> 00:52:39,625
I won't give my jewelry!
Go to the shop and get the money!

655
00:52:39,750 --> 00:52:42,958
You damn fool!
If I go there, they'll slit my throat!

656
00:52:43,083 --> 00:52:45,583
I swear I'll give it back to you
once we return here.

657
00:52:45,708 --> 00:52:48,250
Oh no! This isn't my jewelry!
It is my mother's.

658
00:52:48,375 --> 00:52:51,583
When carrying me to the Tirupattur temple,
she found it on the street.

659
00:52:51,708 --> 00:52:53,833
It was god given.
I won't give it to anyone!

660
00:52:53,958 --> 00:52:55,125
You brat!
-My God!

661
00:52:55,250 --> 00:52:59,083
I'm in a big trouble! If I go there,
you'll be widowed and tonsured!

662
00:52:59,208 --> 00:53:01,875
Torture?
I don't care who you are going to torture!

663
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,833
I won't give this to you.
Look at this!

664
00:53:03,958 --> 00:53:06,750
He messed around with everybody
and now he's messing with me!

665
00:53:07,750 --> 00:53:11,000
Say anything except those damn proverbs!
I'll rip your tongue out!

666
00:53:16,250 --> 00:53:20,375
I'm agitated as hell
and you're spewing proverbs?

667
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:22,625
Proverbs, huh?
-Yes!

668
00:53:22,750 --> 00:53:25,833
He can't measure up to himself
but tries measuring up to others!

669
00:53:26,833 --> 00:53:28,375
Just inform every station...

670
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:31,375
...within a four kilometer radius
of the Veerabhadran temple.

671
00:53:32,875 --> 00:53:35,500
About 5 feet 4 and a half inches.
He wears thick glasses.

672
00:53:35,625 --> 00:53:38,000
One important thing:
If you find him...

673
00:53:38,125 --> 00:53:40,000
...quietly take him
to our freight lodge.

674
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,750
If anybody asks,
he's a terrorist.

675
00:53:42,875 --> 00:53:45,000
They won't probe further.
You got that?

676
00:53:45,625 --> 00:53:48,125
I feel something bad's going to happen,
Manga.

677
00:53:48,250 --> 00:53:50,458
Let's go back to our place.
-Do you ever shut up?

678
00:53:50,583 --> 00:53:53,125
He punched Manga.
He taunted him.

679
00:53:53,250 --> 00:53:55,250
He spat in his face.
And now, he mocks him!

680
00:53:55,375 --> 00:53:57,958
He's making criminals like us
waste time chasing him!

681
00:53:58,083 --> 00:54:00,333
I'll tear him to pieces!
-I'll burn them!

682
00:54:00,458 --> 00:54:03,000
Give the ashes to Manga!
-He'll rub it on his forehead!

683
00:54:03,125 --> 00:54:04,250
How about that, boss?

684
00:54:04,375 --> 00:54:05,500
You ungrateful pigs!

685
00:54:05,625 --> 00:54:08,083
You'd leave
the hand that fed you to rot in prison?

686
00:54:08,208 --> 00:54:09,625
Damn slimeballs...
-Shut up!

687
00:54:09,750 --> 00:54:11,625
Not a day passes by without your moping!

688
00:54:11,750 --> 00:54:15,750
I must catch Pichai today!
I must chop him and grind him up!

689
00:54:15,875 --> 00:54:18,083
I don't care if I go to prison
for five or ten years!

690
00:54:18,208 --> 00:54:20,083
Until then, keep your damn mouth shut!

691
00:54:20,208 --> 00:54:21,875
Try playing the judge,
I'll do you in!

692
00:54:45,083 --> 00:54:46,083
Sir?

693
00:54:47,083 --> 00:54:49,333
Is there a bike mechanic shop nearby?

694
00:54:49,458 --> 00:54:51,625
What's the problem?
-The bike won't start.

695
00:55:00,125 --> 00:55:02,583
Asking a car mechanic
where to find a bike mechanic!

696
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:07,250
Coil's gone.
-Please try to fix it.

697
00:55:07,375 --> 00:55:10,125
I'd be very grateful.
-It won't work. The coil's wrecked!

698
00:55:10,250 --> 00:55:11,875
It's brand new.
I've had it for a week.

699
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,750
Few wires may be off.
Please check.

700
00:55:13,875 --> 00:55:16,000
What?
You got this bike just last week?

701
00:55:16,125 --> 00:55:17,375
This bike?
-Yes, indeed!

702
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:19,875
Ten years ago, my uncle bought this
from a showroom.

703
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,625
He went to pee
before riding the bike.

704
00:55:22,750 --> 00:55:25,500
He slipped and broke his back.
He was bed-ridden for ten years.

705
00:55:25,625 --> 00:55:27,000
He just died last week.

706
00:55:27,125 --> 00:55:29,250
Actor Sivakumar attended his funeral.

707
00:55:29,375 --> 00:55:31,458
Figured I'd ride it
as it was just lying around.

708
00:55:31,583 --> 00:55:34,958
Being unused really hindered it.
Please see what you can do. It's new.

709
00:55:35,083 --> 00:55:36,500
New, you say?
-Yes!

710
00:55:36,625 --> 00:55:39,625
My butcher offered to buy it
for 18,000 rupees. I flatly refused!

711
00:55:39,750 --> 00:55:41,625
18,000 for this?
-For what else then?

712
00:55:41,750 --> 00:55:43,125
Alright, you give me a price.

713
00:55:43,250 --> 00:55:44,750
Price? For this?

714
00:55:44,875 --> 00:55:47,000
If you were to buy this,
how much would you pay?

715
00:55:47,125 --> 00:55:48,125
I'm not buying this.

716
00:55:48,250 --> 00:55:50,125
Just for fun,
tell me how much you'd pay.

717
00:55:50,250 --> 00:55:52,583
I'm not buying this!
-Come on! Name your price!

718
00:55:52,708 --> 00:55:53,833
Less than 5,000 rupees!

719
00:55:53,958 --> 00:55:55,375
How about 4,000?
-Not a chance!

720
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:57,125
3,500?
-Good grief...

721
00:55:57,250 --> 00:55:59,000
3,000?
-I don't want it.

722
00:55:59,125 --> 00:56:00,708
2,500?
-You better leave!

723
00:56:00,833 --> 00:56:01,958
Hold on a second, sir...

724
00:56:02,083 --> 00:56:04,250
Give me 2,000.
I really need to go to my hometown.

725
00:56:05,250 --> 00:56:06,875
Got the RC book?
-Oh, here goes...

726
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,875
My uncle's debit card, credit card,
ration card and RC book...

727
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,500
...burned down in a house fire
two years ago.

728
00:56:14,583 --> 00:56:16,708
Only 2,000 rupees.
Let's finish this.

729
00:56:16,833 --> 00:56:18,250
Let's finish it.

730
00:56:18,375 --> 00:56:19,750
Wonderful!

731
00:56:19,875 --> 00:56:21,833
Go wait inside.
I'll bring over the cash.

732
00:56:21,958 --> 00:56:22,958
Alright, sir.

733
00:56:31,583 --> 00:56:33,625
Constable sir, this is Palani speaking.

734
00:56:33,750 --> 00:56:35,625
A suspicious man brought over a bike.

735
00:56:36,625 --> 00:56:38,125
He's up to something.

736
00:56:38,250 --> 00:56:40,250
He speaks like AVM Rajan
(60s Tamil actor).

737
00:56:40,375 --> 00:56:44,750
Besides his shirt and trousers,
he wears his watch on the right side.

738
00:56:44,875 --> 00:56:47,583
He's a thief.
No doubt about it.

739
00:56:47,708 --> 00:56:48,708
Rajdoot bike.

740
00:56:49,833 --> 00:56:50,833
Hold on a minute.

741
00:57:04,625 --> 00:57:05,625
Capture him!

742
00:57:29,708 --> 00:57:30,708
Grab him, buddy!

743
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:35,000
Grab his leg and pull him out!

744
00:58:04,875 --> 00:58:06,833
Mr. Manga, I've got him.

745
00:58:22,250 --> 00:58:25,125
You bloody scoundrel!
Who do you think you're messing with?

746
00:58:25,250 --> 00:58:27,250
Lying through your teeth, are you?

747
00:58:34,875 --> 00:58:35,875
What happened?

748
00:58:38,833 --> 00:58:40,000
What the hell is going on?

749
00:58:40,125 --> 00:58:41,125
He's having a seizure!

750
00:58:42,125 --> 00:58:44,000
He might swallow his tongue!

751
00:58:44,125 --> 00:58:46,333
Really?
-This is no ordinary seizure.

752
00:58:46,458 --> 00:58:48,708
What is it, then?
-A tonic-clonic seizure!

753
00:58:48,833 --> 00:58:49,833
Oh My God!

754
00:58:53,625 --> 00:58:54,833
Get rid of these chains!

755
00:58:56,208 --> 00:58:58,083
Careful, guys!
Bring him down!

756
00:58:58,208 --> 00:59:00,500
All of you get him down.
He might die!

757
00:59:00,625 --> 00:59:02,083
Lower him down...
-Careful!

758
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,208
Get some water!

759
00:59:07,333 --> 00:59:08,625
Be careful!
Set him down!

760
00:59:20,583 --> 00:59:21,708
Where the hell is he?

761
00:59:23,375 --> 00:59:24,375
I asked you where he is!

762
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:26,458
Save him first, sir!
-He's inside, sir!

763
00:59:26,583 --> 00:59:27,583
Get out of the way!

764
00:59:44,125 --> 00:59:45,208
Get over here!

765
00:59:45,333 --> 00:59:46,375
Listen to me!
Come here!

766
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:49,125
I'll come tomorrow.
I have something urgent to attend to!

767
00:59:49,250 --> 00:59:52,875
Don't do it!
I'll break your ass in half! Get over here!

768
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,500
Come on, buddy!
Come on down!

769
00:59:55,625 --> 00:59:56,875
I'll buy your bike myself!

770
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:00,500
I'll take it tomorrow! Take care of it!
-He's getting away! Don't run!

771
01:00:00,625 --> 01:00:01,625
Come on!

772
01:00:49,125 --> 01:00:52,125
Could you give us the route to
Number 10, Anton Daasan Street?

773
01:00:54,083 --> 01:00:56,625
What is the route to
Number 10, Anton Daasan Street?

774
01:00:56,750 --> 01:00:59,250
Hey, I'm talking to you!
How do I go to Number 10...

775
01:01:06,250 --> 01:01:07,250
Let's go!

776
01:01:13,875 --> 01:01:15,250
Boss...
-What?

777
01:01:15,375 --> 01:01:19,500
Pichai's bike is broken.
We last saw him at the Veerabhadran temple.

778
01:01:19,625 --> 01:01:21,708
He didn't have a bike with him then.

779
01:01:21,833 --> 01:01:23,500
Where is the mechanic shop?

780
01:01:23,625 --> 01:01:25,875
In the street
next to the Veerabhadran temple.

781
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
Where will his wife and kids be?

782
01:01:28,125 --> 01:01:31,250
They may be hiding in some alley
in that street. We'll get them!

783
01:01:37,333 --> 01:01:39,375
Why didn't you tell me this earlier?
Get in!

784
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:49,500
We're here.

785
01:01:51,125 --> 01:01:53,958
How do I go to Saidapet from here?
-Get lost.

786
01:01:54,083 --> 01:01:56,000
So you cast me aside
once your job is done?

787
01:01:56,125 --> 01:01:57,625
And to think I helped you...

788
01:01:58,750 --> 01:02:00,875
Koduku seems to be missing.
Did they kill him?

789
01:02:01,875 --> 01:02:02,875
You brutes!

790
01:02:04,375 --> 01:02:05,375
What do I do now?

791
01:02:08,208 --> 01:02:09,958
Hello, sir!
Mr. Manickam!

792
01:02:11,458 --> 01:02:12,583
Mr. Manickam?

793
01:02:12,708 --> 01:02:15,625
What is it?
-A knife's hanging over my head.

794
01:02:15,750 --> 01:02:18,708
You're the only one who can help me.
-Go on...

795
01:02:18,833 --> 01:02:21,875
Please lend me 3,000 rupees.
I'll return it in three days.

796
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:25,333
Do you remember the last time
you came to this shop?

797
01:02:25,458 --> 01:02:27,708
No, I don't.
-I certainly do!

798
01:02:27,833 --> 01:02:31,375
Two years ago on Diwali,
you bought two half-sleeve shirts from me.

799
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:34,583
I charged 70 rupees.
You bargained it down to 45 rupees.

800
01:02:34,708 --> 01:02:39,458
You tried out the shirt here
and paid me 30 rupees...

801
01:02:39,583 --> 01:02:42,208
...and said you'd send
the rest of the money with your son.

802
01:02:42,333 --> 01:02:45,625
At long last, you've finally arrived.

803
01:02:45,750 --> 01:02:49,458
Please help me. I consider these scissors
as your feet and beg of you.

804
01:02:49,583 --> 01:02:51,500
My God!
He stabbed me with those scissors!

805
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:53,750
I'm sorry, okay?

806
01:02:58,875 --> 01:03:00,375
It's bleeding!

807
01:03:00,500 --> 01:03:03,125
I can't ask the hotel guy, either.
He'll chase me, too.

808
01:03:04,750 --> 01:03:07,000
Hey, Bhai!
Don't you know when not to show up?

809
01:03:07,125 --> 01:03:10,375
Can I ask Bhai?
He'd give biriyani, not cash.

810
01:03:11,958 --> 01:03:14,875
I've got plans to go to America
next month, sir.

811
01:03:15,875 --> 01:03:19,375
I've got to go and buy the tools
I need for that, as well.

812
01:03:20,375 --> 01:03:22,250
Please show some leniency.

813
01:03:23,250 --> 01:03:27,875
When will that dunderhead Pichai
ever come?

814
01:03:33,250 --> 01:03:34,375
Boss!

815
01:03:36,500 --> 01:03:38,125
Who asked for this damn smoke, now?

816
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,750
Hey, Siva!
Haven't we heard this hymn in some film?

817
01:03:43,750 --> 01:03:47,500
Look what fate has befallen us...

818
01:04:21,375 --> 01:04:23,583
Hey!
Did you see a lady and two kids go by?

819
01:04:23,708 --> 01:04:25,708
I don't know Tamil, sir.

820
01:04:25,833 --> 01:04:27,125
Ask him in his language.

821
01:04:27,250 --> 01:04:30,125
Did a woman and two kids go this way?
-I didn't see any.

822
01:04:30,250 --> 01:04:31,375
Let's move!

823
01:04:43,625 --> 01:04:46,958
Can a pregnant woman like you
roam around like this?

824
01:04:47,083 --> 01:04:50,375
Ruffians chasing you?
Douchebags!

825
01:04:50,500 --> 01:04:52,000
Have you told the cops?

826
01:04:52,125 --> 01:04:55,458
Tobacco?
Only my mom chews them.

827
01:04:55,583 --> 01:04:58,500
My goodness.
You're hard of hearing, too?

828
01:04:58,625 --> 01:05:00,500
It's alright, I don't need your money.

829
01:05:06,875 --> 01:05:10,125
Mom! Mom!
Over there...

830
01:05:10,250 --> 01:05:12,375
What?
-That big moustached man is coming!

831
01:05:12,500 --> 01:05:14,500
He and his gang are looking for us!

832
01:05:14,625 --> 01:05:16,833
Where are you taking me?

833
01:05:17,833 --> 01:05:19,875
Come quickly, mom!

834
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,375
They're here, mom!

835
01:05:31,875 --> 01:05:34,333
Did a pregnant woman come by here?

836
01:05:34,458 --> 01:05:35,875
Nobody came this way.

837
01:05:53,375 --> 01:05:54,750
I'll have a glass of juice.

838
01:06:02,708 --> 01:06:05,083
I just suggested this idea on a whim.

839
01:06:05,208 --> 01:06:08,375
We'll find them, right?
My stomach is churning!

840
01:06:11,208 --> 01:06:12,500
Why didn't you stay quiet?

841
01:06:45,083 --> 01:06:46,083
A hand!

842
01:06:46,208 --> 01:06:47,208
My leg!

843
01:06:49,750 --> 01:06:50,750
A hand!

844
01:06:50,875 --> 01:06:51,875
My leg!

845
01:06:55,375 --> 01:06:57,250
A hand!
My leg!

846
01:06:59,500 --> 01:07:00,750
Stop messing with me!

847
01:07:00,875 --> 01:07:02,250
Enough with this nonsense!

848
01:07:14,750 --> 01:07:16,250
You damn buffaloes!

849
01:07:16,375 --> 01:07:17,875
Do you have nothing better to do?

850
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,875
Will you not rest
until you've messed around with my husband?

851
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:22,750
Run home as fast as you can!

852
01:07:22,875 --> 01:07:26,458
When my husband shows up,
he'll hack you all up and feed you to dogs!

853
01:07:27,833 --> 01:07:29,708
Even the lord can't save you now.

854
01:07:47,125 --> 01:07:48,583
Let go of me!

855
01:07:48,708 --> 01:07:49,708
Stop!

856
01:07:52,625 --> 01:07:54,125
Drag her in and shut the door!

857
01:07:55,625 --> 01:07:56,625
Let go of me!

858
01:08:11,250 --> 01:08:13,750
Did you see a woman and two kids
go by here?

859
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,208
Let me go!
I said let me go!

860
01:08:32,458 --> 01:08:34,375
You bloody vagabonds!
Let me go!

861
01:08:40,458 --> 01:08:41,458
Let go of me!

862
01:08:43,333 --> 01:08:45,583
Let her go.

863
01:08:48,250 --> 01:08:50,125
What the hell do you want?

864
01:08:50,250 --> 01:08:52,125
Slimeball!
What do you want?

865
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,500
What the hell do you want?

866
01:08:56,583 --> 01:08:57,875
Oh my God!

867
01:09:06,833 --> 01:09:08,875
Oh my goodness!

868
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,625
She's in labour!
Lift her up!

869
01:09:11,750 --> 01:09:12,833
Get her up!
-Wait.

870
01:09:13,833 --> 01:09:15,375
Where?
-The hospital!

871
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:17,500
Why?
-Why?

872
01:09:17,625 --> 01:09:20,250
She's about to have a child.
-Let her have it here.

873
01:09:20,375 --> 01:09:24,083
She's in labour, man! She might be hurt.
-Let her be.

874
01:09:24,208 --> 01:09:25,750
She might die!
-Let her die!

875
01:09:26,750 --> 01:09:27,875
I want Pichai!

876
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,708
Are you even a human being?
Have you no conscience?

877
01:09:30,833 --> 01:09:33,000
She's in pain!
And she's a woman!

878
01:09:33,125 --> 01:09:35,750
Do you know what pain is?
Any idea how much labour hurts?

879
01:09:35,875 --> 01:09:37,750
I do.
Your mother did.

880
01:09:37,875 --> 01:09:41,125
Your mother, my only sister,
underwent this same pain!

881
01:09:41,250 --> 01:09:43,625
Are you blind to that girl's pain?

882
01:09:43,750 --> 01:09:45,958
You're going to hell!
What can you take with you?

883
01:09:46,083 --> 01:09:48,333
What in the world can you take with you?

884
01:09:48,458 --> 01:09:51,000
Wretch!
To think I raised an animal like you...

885
01:09:51,125 --> 01:09:52,208
Go ahead and kill me!

886
01:09:52,333 --> 01:09:54,958
Before she died,
your mom asked me to take care of you.

887
01:09:55,083 --> 01:09:58,750
From then till now, I did just that.
Catered to your every need!

888
01:09:58,875 --> 01:10:01,250
This is my remuneration.
Go ahead and kill me!

889
01:10:03,875 --> 01:10:05,625
You talk too much.

890
01:10:05,750 --> 01:10:06,750
Get her out of here.

891
01:10:14,458 --> 01:10:18,500
Excuse me. Did you see my wife
and two kids? She's pregnant!

892
01:10:18,625 --> 01:10:21,250
Oh, so you're the husband?
Do you have any sense?

893
01:10:21,375 --> 01:10:23,750
At times like these,
shouldn't you keep her close?

894
01:10:23,875 --> 01:10:26,375
Look what happened!
Four thugs took her away!

895
01:10:26,500 --> 01:10:28,500
What are you going to do?
Listen to me.

896
01:10:28,625 --> 01:10:31,333
Take a left turn here.
You'll come across a police station.

897
01:10:31,458 --> 01:10:32,875
File a complaint with them.

898
01:10:34,375 --> 01:10:37,125
Hey! I'm trying to help you
and you're just sitting down!

899
01:10:38,125 --> 01:10:40,750
Good grief!
Is this guy hard of hearing, too?

900
01:10:40,875 --> 01:10:42,583
Some screwed up family this is!

901
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:14,417
It will be alright.
Just bear with it for a while.

902
01:11:17,125 --> 01:11:18,875
Just for a while.
Please bear with it.

903
01:12:41,792 --> 01:12:44,042
'Is everything fine and dandy?'

904
01:12:51,792 --> 01:12:54,625
'Are the mind and body
feeling fine and dandy?'

905
01:13:03,667 --> 01:13:05,417
Where are they?
-Over there, ma'am.

906
01:13:07,792 --> 01:13:09,292
Is this a hospital or a theatre?

907
01:13:09,417 --> 01:13:10,917
The pregnant woman is on the run.

908
01:13:42,667 --> 01:13:43,667
Go look over there!

909
01:14:56,542 --> 01:14:58,542
Don't say even a word!

910
01:15:11,917 --> 01:15:13,542
Sir, it's Pichai speaking.

911
01:15:13,667 --> 01:15:16,125
I'll come wherever you are.
Please spare my family.

912
01:15:16,250 --> 01:15:20,250
Please listen to me, sir.
Please say something!

913
01:15:20,375 --> 01:15:23,667
This was the hand, right?
Chop my right hand off!

914
01:15:23,792 --> 01:15:25,875
But please spare my wife and kids.

915
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:27,917
Tell me where you are.
I will come.

916
01:15:28,042 --> 01:15:31,375
Can you give me a pen, sir?
It is urgent.

917
01:15:31,500 --> 01:15:34,417
Please give me the address, sir.
I'll be there.

918
01:15:34,542 --> 01:15:38,042
I'll come, sir!
-You don't have to come.

919
01:15:40,042 --> 01:15:41,792
Your wife isn't here.

920
01:15:41,917 --> 01:15:43,000
She managed to escape.

921
01:15:44,167 --> 01:15:46,417
You run.
Just keep running.

922
01:15:47,625 --> 01:15:48,667
I'll hunt you down.

923
01:16:03,875 --> 01:16:08,542
You ever do that, I'll run away from you.
-You run, I'll hunt you down.

924
01:16:08,667 --> 01:16:11,750
Yeah, right!
We will see!

925
01:16:15,292 --> 01:16:17,042
You run!
I'll hunt you down!

926
01:16:25,917 --> 01:16:28,417
You run!
I'll hunt you down!

927
01:16:32,750 --> 01:16:34,542
You run!
I'll hunt you down!

928
01:16:39,750 --> 01:16:41,292
You run!
-I'll hunt you down!

929
01:17:42,417 --> 01:17:44,750
Sir!
-What?

930
01:18:16,875 --> 01:18:19,417
Castes are only two.

931
01:18:19,542 --> 01:18:24,917
The generous nobles
and the miserly ignoble!

932
01:18:25,042 --> 01:18:26,417
Bro, look over there!

933
01:18:28,917 --> 01:18:30,375
Hey, stop!
Where are you going?

934
01:18:36,167 --> 01:18:39,500
You won't tell me where you're going.
At least tell me where you are from!

935
01:18:41,292 --> 01:18:42,792
Do you know Mars?
-What's that?

936
01:18:42,917 --> 01:18:44,042
Surya's movie!

937
01:19:02,167 --> 01:19:04,000
What was his name again?
-Pichaimurthy.

938
01:19:09,917 --> 01:19:12,417
Is this about the phone bill?
I'll pay it. Don't bug me.

939
01:19:14,292 --> 01:19:16,167
He cut the call the moment
I said his name.

940
01:19:16,292 --> 01:19:18,250
Uncle, can you give it a try again?

941
01:19:18,375 --> 01:19:20,625
Kiddo, I've some work.
Go and ask someone else.

942
01:19:27,750 --> 01:19:29,542
Watchman, don't let these two in!

943
01:19:39,042 --> 01:19:43,417
Did you see two kids and a pregnant lady
go this way?

944
01:19:43,542 --> 01:19:44,917
It's my wife, sir!

945
01:19:45,042 --> 01:19:46,417
Why don't you say something?

946
01:19:47,917 --> 01:19:50,750
Are you mad?
-Sit idle for a while, you'll know!

947
01:19:55,667 --> 01:20:00,625
'I’m but a fool
and was told so by four literate souls.'

948
01:20:00,750 --> 01:20:01,917
You broke everything!

949
01:20:02,042 --> 01:20:05,250
'Let bygones be bygones.'

950
01:20:05,375 --> 01:20:09,292
'Nothing last forever anyway!'
-Are you mad?

951
01:20:09,417 --> 01:20:12,500
Wretch! You have spoilt my business.

952
01:20:12,625 --> 01:20:16,292
'Let bygones be bygones.'
-My owner is going to blame me for this!

953
01:20:26,417 --> 01:20:29,000
Who are you?
-Don't you know? I'm a lunatic!

954
01:20:35,125 --> 01:20:36,292
Lock him in!

955
01:20:46,917 --> 01:20:47,917
Nanjuundan.

956
01:20:49,625 --> 01:20:52,542
Isn't your father,
the owner of Hotel Swarna?

957
01:20:53,667 --> 01:20:54,667
Yes, sir.

958
01:20:57,917 --> 01:21:01,292
Have you thought through this?
-I'm sure. He is my husband.

959
01:21:03,417 --> 01:21:06,292
He is politically influential.

960
01:21:06,417 --> 01:21:07,792
Are you trying to threaten me?

961
01:21:07,917 --> 01:21:10,292
So what if he is a bigwig?
I'm a registrar. I am no less!

962
01:21:10,417 --> 01:21:12,042
I'm going to retire in six months.

963
01:21:13,125 --> 01:21:16,542
Above all,
there is something called conscience.

964
01:21:16,667 --> 01:21:18,542
Where is the receipt issued at the temple?

965
01:21:18,667 --> 01:21:20,542
We aren't married yet.

966
01:21:20,667 --> 01:21:22,417
What?
Not married?

967
01:21:22,542 --> 01:21:24,875
How can I register your marriage then?

968
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:26,917
Aren't you educated?
Don't you have sense?

969
01:21:27,042 --> 01:21:29,250
Kayal's parents are hunting us
across the city.

970
01:21:29,375 --> 01:21:32,542
We are helpless! Please help!
-I beg of you, sir. Help us!

971
01:21:32,667 --> 01:21:35,542
Just issue a certificate
that declares us married.

972
01:21:35,667 --> 01:21:38,667
We will go the commissioner’s office
and surrender ourselves.

973
01:21:47,167 --> 01:21:50,250
Do one thing!
Go outside.

974
01:21:50,375 --> 01:21:52,875
There will be beggar
right outside the building.

975
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:54,875
He was a freedom fighter.

976
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,167
Get a signature from him.

977
01:21:57,292 --> 01:22:00,875
I'll register and certify
this as a self-respect marriage.

978
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:02,792
Please hurry!

979
01:22:02,917 --> 01:22:04,042
Order a cup of tea for me!

980
01:22:23,500 --> 01:22:26,292
A pregnant woman!
Lift her up.

981
01:22:26,417 --> 01:22:30,417
Couldn't you drive carefully?
-I was careful. She got in my way.

982
01:22:30,542 --> 01:22:31,542
How careless!

983
01:22:31,667 --> 01:22:34,167
Get her inside the vehicle.
Be careful.

984
01:22:34,292 --> 01:22:36,417
Careful. Watch your step.

985
01:22:38,375 --> 01:22:40,917
Where is your husband?
Where did he go?

986
01:22:42,042 --> 01:22:43,667
Can you hear me?

987
01:22:43,792 --> 01:22:46,167
You wretch!
Couldn't you be careful?

988
01:22:46,292 --> 01:22:48,167
Why are you beating him up?

989
01:22:48,292 --> 01:22:51,167
Do you see that?
That's the heart of a woman!

990
01:22:51,292 --> 01:22:53,167
Dear, where do you have to go?

991
01:22:53,292 --> 01:22:54,875
I don't understand anything.

992
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:58,667
Poor thing, don't say such things.
Nothing will happen to you.

993
01:22:58,792 --> 01:23:00,625
Where is your husband?
-My husband?

994
01:23:00,750 --> 01:23:04,042
He didn't tie a knot,
he tied a noose!

995
01:23:04,167 --> 01:23:07,917
I wonder where that leaky butt
is taking a dump.

996
01:23:08,042 --> 01:23:11,750
Look at her fate!
Do you have any siblings?

997
01:23:11,875 --> 01:23:17,417
Any brothers?
-Brother? 9823545154.

998
01:23:17,542 --> 01:23:20,417
What's that?
-That's his mobile number.

999
01:23:20,542 --> 01:23:21,917
Here.
Give him a ring.

1000
01:23:22,042 --> 01:23:24,500
Find out where he is.
We'll drop you there.

1001
01:23:28,417 --> 01:23:30,542
Hello, Uncle!
This is Kotee.

1002
01:23:30,667 --> 01:23:34,167
Oh my dear brother!
Where are you?

1003
01:23:34,292 --> 01:23:39,417
My husband has abandoned me
in the middle of the road.

1004
01:23:39,542 --> 01:23:44,042
I should have married a potato
instead of this jackass!

1005
01:23:44,167 --> 01:23:47,792
Look at my plight now.
I'm being chased by random people!

1006
01:23:47,917 --> 01:23:50,292
I'm wandering around aimlessly.

1007
01:23:50,417 --> 01:23:52,875
Is there no one to question this?

1008
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:57,167
Is this the way to treat a pregnant lady?

1009
01:23:57,292 --> 01:23:59,542
What work is more important than her?

1010
01:23:59,667 --> 01:24:02,125
Tell me where you are.
We'll drop her over there.

1011
01:24:03,917 --> 01:24:06,042
One moment.
Please note the address.

1012
01:24:07,917 --> 01:24:12,375
Tell me.
Where in Rajesh Road?

1013
01:24:12,500 --> 01:24:13,750
The government school?

1014
01:24:13,875 --> 01:24:16,625
Yeah, I'm aware of the registrar office.
-Where did you go?

1015
01:24:16,750 --> 01:24:20,042
Where exactly?
-How did you have the heart to go?

1016
01:24:20,167 --> 01:24:22,542
I'll call you once I reach the school.

1017
01:24:22,667 --> 01:24:24,542
Shut up!

1018
01:24:24,667 --> 01:24:26,917
I'll teach her a lesson!

1019
01:24:28,292 --> 01:24:29,792
That runaway hag!

1020
01:24:36,167 --> 01:24:37,792
Hey, stop the car!

1021
01:24:39,750 --> 01:24:41,167
Turn off the engine.

1022
01:24:48,292 --> 01:24:50,250
Gita!
-Brother?

1023
01:24:50,375 --> 01:24:51,375
Remove the ring.

1024
01:24:56,792 --> 01:24:58,250
Put it on.

1025
01:24:58,375 --> 01:24:59,500
On your hand!

1026
01:25:08,042 --> 01:25:10,792
How do we catch Pichai?
-We don't need to catch him.

1027
01:25:10,917 --> 01:25:13,292
We'll get hold of his wife again.
-Where will she be?

1028
01:25:13,417 --> 01:25:16,250
She'll be seeking her brother.
-She ran away from the hospital.

1029
01:25:16,375 --> 01:25:20,042
He has to marry that girl today.
Else he is dead meat!

1030
01:25:20,250 --> 01:25:23,292
His guys are looking for them everywhere!
-Yes, they are.

1031
01:25:23,417 --> 01:25:26,750
Fearing Nanjuundan,
the boy went to North Madras for marriage.

1032
01:25:26,875 --> 01:25:29,792
We have 45 registrar offices in Chennai.

1033
01:25:29,917 --> 01:25:32,167
Nanjuundan's men will be scouring
every office.

1034
01:25:32,292 --> 01:25:34,667
But not the Saidapet office.
-Why?

1035
01:25:35,667 --> 01:25:37,792
Nanjuundan's house is in Saidapet.

1036
01:25:37,917 --> 01:25:41,292
Right!
Those fools won't check their own area!

1037
01:25:41,417 --> 01:25:43,167
He hoodwinked them!

1038
01:25:47,417 --> 01:25:48,792
Hurry up!

1039
01:25:52,292 --> 01:25:54,750
I've been screaming my lungs out.
Please believe me!

1040
01:25:54,875 --> 01:25:57,417
Driver! At least you believe me.
I'm not a lunatic!

1041
01:25:57,542 --> 01:25:59,667
We'll know when we get to the hospital.

1042
01:25:59,792 --> 01:26:02,500
I’m in huge trouble.
My wife and kids are in danger.

1043
01:26:02,625 --> 01:26:06,292
If something happens to them.
You will be booked for murder.

1044
01:26:06,417 --> 01:26:07,667
Where do you work?

1045
01:26:07,792 --> 01:26:11,500
I'm a lawyer at the High Court.
I'll get you penalized under section 304.

1046
01:26:13,542 --> 01:26:15,042
He is doling out law!

1047
01:26:15,167 --> 01:26:16,875
Bro, let's let him go!

1048
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:18,792
That's what I'm saying.
Let me go.

1049
01:26:22,875 --> 01:26:23,875
What's the problem?

1050
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:27,167
There is a guy who is talking too much.
Please deal with him.

1051
01:26:28,167 --> 01:26:31,125
Get down, folks.
Now we'll know who the real lunatic is.

1052
01:26:41,792 --> 01:26:44,042
I'm a lunatic!

1053
01:26:55,417 --> 01:26:57,292
Damn, no one seems to know music!

1054
01:27:07,167 --> 01:27:10,292
Sir, please let me go.
-Get in!

1055
01:27:15,292 --> 01:27:16,292
Move over!

1056
01:27:18,167 --> 01:27:19,792
Everyone out!
I've got work to do.

1057
01:27:30,542 --> 01:27:33,125
Sir, please don't!

1058
01:27:33,250 --> 01:27:35,542
You ran away then.
Try running away now!

1059
01:27:39,667 --> 01:27:41,375
This guy has no better thing to do!

1060
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:46,667
What if something happens to him?
-We will be in trouble.

1061
01:27:46,792 --> 01:27:50,167
He isn't listening to us.
-Why is he doing unnecessary stuff?

1062
01:28:13,292 --> 01:28:17,792
Xavier, get a van to the booth.
Bring some men along.

1063
01:28:17,917 --> 01:28:20,542
We need to wrap this up.
Hurry up.

1064
01:28:20,667 --> 01:28:23,000
You look like a cop
from the film "Thanga Padakkam".

1065
01:28:23,125 --> 01:28:24,292
How could you do this?

1066
01:28:27,792 --> 01:28:28,792
What's in the box?

1067
01:28:34,542 --> 01:28:36,417
Hand over the box.
Give it!

1068
01:28:36,542 --> 01:28:38,167
Sir, please!
-Hand it over.

1069
01:28:38,292 --> 01:28:41,417
Sir, please. Please don't!
-Give it to me!

1070
01:28:55,292 --> 01:28:56,500
What the hell is all this?

1071
01:29:07,417 --> 01:29:09,667
Who the hell is he?
-My dad, sir!

1072
01:29:09,792 --> 01:29:11,792
Such a big mush!

1073
01:29:11,917 --> 01:29:13,167
Was he a great cop?

1074
01:29:13,292 --> 01:29:15,292
My dad was a great barber.

1075
01:29:19,667 --> 01:29:21,792
Then it is time to shave off the mustache.

1076
01:29:24,250 --> 01:29:27,417
What are you looking at?
Now do you understand our power?

1077
01:29:27,542 --> 01:29:29,292
What now?
-Chief is on the line.

1078
01:29:29,417 --> 01:29:33,000
Did you rat me out?
-He called me cause he couldn't reach you.

1079
01:29:33,125 --> 01:29:36,792
You could've told him I was in the loo.
-Said that twice already!

1080
01:29:36,917 --> 01:29:38,917
Why do you bother me like this?
Give it to me!

1081
01:29:42,417 --> 01:29:45,250
Sir, yes sir!

1082
01:29:46,292 --> 01:29:47,875
I'll get it done by tomorrow, sir!

1083
01:29:50,042 --> 01:29:51,667
Okay, sir!

1084
01:29:51,792 --> 01:29:52,792
Definitely, sir!

1085
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,292
Okay.
Sure, I'll be there.

1086
01:29:57,417 --> 01:29:58,417
I'll let them know.

1087
01:30:01,625 --> 01:30:02,625
What a pain in the ass!

1088
01:30:25,542 --> 01:30:26,917
We're there.
Stop the car.

1089
01:30:30,250 --> 01:30:31,250
Hurry.

1090
01:30:32,792 --> 01:30:33,792
Make it fast.

1091
01:30:35,542 --> 01:30:36,542
Right here.

1092
01:30:36,667 --> 01:30:38,542
Kayal's father is here.

1093
01:30:38,667 --> 01:30:40,000
Make this fast.
Let's go!

1094
01:30:40,125 --> 01:30:42,542
I'm outside the registrar office.
Where are you?

1095
01:30:43,542 --> 01:30:44,542
You're inside?

1096
01:30:46,042 --> 01:30:47,250
Alright then.
-Run!

1097
01:30:53,042 --> 01:30:54,542
You go ahead, dear.

1098
01:30:54,667 --> 01:30:56,667
How can she handle this alone?

1099
01:30:59,042 --> 01:31:01,542
Kayal! Your father is here!
-Raghu, her father is here!

1100
01:31:02,167 --> 01:31:04,542
Careful, dear.
Come along.

1101
01:31:08,042 --> 01:31:10,542
I got the signature. Let's go ahead!
-Wait!

1102
01:31:10,667 --> 01:31:11,792
Do I have ten hands?

1103
01:31:11,917 --> 01:31:14,625
Sign here, madam.
-Please hurry, sir!

1104
01:31:19,125 --> 01:31:20,125
Careful, dear.

1105
01:31:22,292 --> 01:31:24,000
What's with the laughter?
-Careful.

1106
01:31:33,500 --> 01:31:35,292
Please help us, sir!

1107
01:31:35,417 --> 01:31:37,375
Wait!
I'm looking at your paperwork now.

1108
01:31:46,667 --> 01:31:47,667
They're almost here!

1109
01:31:48,792 --> 01:31:50,917
Faster, sir!
They're here!

1110
01:31:51,042 --> 01:31:52,042
Please move aside.

1111
01:31:57,167 --> 01:31:58,167
Yes, sign right there.

1112
01:32:14,042 --> 01:32:15,042
Easy there.

1113
01:32:24,042 --> 01:32:25,042
You can get down now.

1114
01:32:26,375 --> 01:32:27,542
Hey Raghu!

1115
01:32:27,667 --> 01:32:29,542
Where have you been all this while?

1116
01:32:29,667 --> 01:32:31,417
We've been going all around the city!

1117
01:32:33,625 --> 01:32:35,417
Where is the girl you ran off with?

1118
01:32:37,917 --> 01:32:39,375
Is she the one?

1119
01:32:39,500 --> 01:32:41,542
My goodness!
What the hell is this?

1120
01:32:41,667 --> 01:32:43,417
She's much older than you!

1121
01:32:43,542 --> 01:32:45,167
Why did you run off with her?

1122
01:32:45,292 --> 01:32:46,375
You damn scoundrel!

1123
01:32:46,500 --> 01:32:49,792
Is she the one
you've had eyes on for so long?

1124
01:32:52,875 --> 01:32:57,042
Just cause my brother's in a bit of a bind,
you'll try charming him like this?

1125
01:32:57,167 --> 01:32:59,375
Where is your family?
I want justice!

1126
01:33:00,375 --> 01:33:02,667
The trouble I went through
while raising this brat!

1127
01:33:04,042 --> 01:33:07,375
Oh Lord Sangili Karuppan!

1128
01:33:07,500 --> 01:33:10,792
Why are you dragging my family
around like this?

1129
01:33:11,875 --> 01:33:13,167
What crime did I commit?

1130
01:33:20,917 --> 01:33:21,917
My Goodness!
-Sis!

1131
01:33:26,667 --> 01:33:29,667
Sis!
What's wrong, sis?

1132
01:33:35,292 --> 01:33:36,292
Ma'am!

1133
01:33:41,125 --> 01:33:42,500
Get her up!

1134
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:50,042
Get out of the way!

1135
01:34:07,917 --> 01:34:10,542
Think this is your house? Drive away!
-Five minutes!

1136
01:34:10,667 --> 01:34:12,125
As soon as my boss arrives.

1137
01:34:12,250 --> 01:34:13,500
Get the car over here!

1138
01:34:16,417 --> 01:34:17,875
Open the door!

1139
01:34:20,292 --> 01:34:21,667
Get that boy into the other car!

1140
01:34:25,875 --> 01:34:28,625
Start it up!
-Just hang on. The hospital's nearby!

1141
01:34:28,750 --> 01:34:30,375
We'll be there soon!

1142
01:34:31,500 --> 01:34:32,792
Drive fast!

1143
01:34:33,792 --> 01:34:34,792
Let me go!

1144
01:34:37,292 --> 01:34:38,667
Hold them!

1145
01:34:49,917 --> 01:34:52,042
Manga, that girl is in labour.

1146
01:34:52,167 --> 01:34:53,750
We're taking her to the hospital.

1147
01:34:53,875 --> 01:34:56,042
Tell him to stop the car.

1148
01:34:57,625 --> 01:34:59,167
What are you glaring at me for?

1149
01:34:59,292 --> 01:35:01,292
Think you're a big ruffian?
So am I!

1150
01:35:01,417 --> 01:35:03,375
Get down!
Let's fight it out! Come on!

1151
01:35:13,292 --> 01:35:14,875
Shut up and sit.

1152
01:35:16,625 --> 01:35:19,167
What's the point of reading the newspaper?

1153
01:35:19,292 --> 01:35:22,375
Even if one launches rockets,
one has to still clean ass by hand.

1154
01:35:23,625 --> 01:35:25,667
What's the point in talking about it?

1155
01:35:25,792 --> 01:35:26,792
One tea, please.

1156
01:35:42,542 --> 01:35:44,625
'Is everything fine and dandy?'

1157
01:35:53,375 --> 01:35:56,667
Subatra!
Where are you, my dear?

1158
01:35:56,792 --> 01:35:58,292
Can you hear me?
-Sir?

1159
01:35:59,292 --> 01:36:00,917
Your wife is at my feet right now.

1160
01:36:01,042 --> 01:36:02,917
Sir...
-Go to the place I tell you to.

1161
01:36:03,042 --> 01:36:05,417
Come to the Tondiarpet steel factory.
I'll be there.

1162
01:36:52,250 --> 01:36:54,417
They abducted my wife!

1163
01:36:54,542 --> 01:36:56,500
I don't know how I'm going to save her.

1164
01:36:56,625 --> 01:36:58,875
She can't hear, either.
Poor woman!

1165
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:00,292
I don't know what to do...

1166
01:37:24,750 --> 01:37:30,542
'Look above,
to find the stars...'

1167
01:37:30,667 --> 01:37:33,750
'...filling your eyes!'

1168
01:37:36,750 --> 01:37:44,625
'A good look you must take,
to find that life is a web of lies!'

1169
01:37:47,875 --> 01:37:50,750
'Feel useless?
Become a seed.'

1170
01:37:50,875 --> 01:37:53,792
'Too many questions?
Become the answer.'

1171
01:37:53,917 --> 01:37:58,125
'Move away from "I" to "We"
and live your life.'

1172
01:38:00,667 --> 01:38:06,417
'Look above,
to find the stars...'

1173
01:38:06,542 --> 01:38:10,417
'...filling your eyes!'

1174
01:38:12,542 --> 01:38:17,167
'A good look you must take...'

1175
01:38:17,292 --> 01:38:20,292
Can I rent a bicycle, sir?
-'...to find that life is a web of lies!'

1176
01:38:20,417 --> 01:38:22,750
Who are you?
How can I just give you a cycle like that?

1177
01:38:22,875 --> 01:38:25,125
My name is Pichai.
I have a saloon in Pudhupettai.

1178
01:38:25,250 --> 01:38:27,000
Pay an advance of 500 rupees
and take it.

1179
01:38:27,125 --> 01:38:29,042
I gave away all the money I had.

1180
01:38:29,167 --> 01:38:30,417
You can take this watch...

1181
01:38:31,792 --> 01:38:34,875
No, this watch doesn't work.
Piece of junk.

1182
01:38:38,542 --> 01:38:40,125
Hold on, man.

1183
01:38:40,250 --> 01:38:41,417
Take the eighth cycle.

1184
01:38:59,917 --> 01:39:02,375
'Despite the web of trickery...'

1185
01:39:02,500 --> 01:39:05,417
'...or the hand of fate...'

1186
01:39:05,542 --> 01:39:10,000
'...always be true to yourself.'

1187
01:39:11,917 --> 01:39:14,375
'Regardless of thorns...'

1188
01:39:14,500 --> 01:39:17,375
'...or stones and rocks...'

1189
01:39:17,500 --> 01:39:23,167
'...your path will continue.
Do not drift away.'

1190
01:39:24,167 --> 01:39:28,375
'Is there a relationship without burden?
Seek and search, you'll find none.'

1191
01:39:30,292 --> 01:39:35,042
'Is there a tomorrow without sorrow?
Celebrate every moment.'

1192
01:39:36,042 --> 01:39:38,750
'See hatred?
Melt it away.'

1193
01:39:38,875 --> 01:39:41,750
'See death?
Be the spring of life.'

1194
01:39:41,875 --> 01:39:46,542
'See darkness?
Be the light and shine away!'

1195
01:39:48,667 --> 01:39:54,500
'Look above,
to find the stars...'

1196
01:39:54,625 --> 01:39:58,000
'...filling your eyes!'

1197
01:40:24,042 --> 01:40:27,250
'Be a flower.'

1198
01:40:27,375 --> 01:40:31,875
'Tomorrow is a lie.
Shower your fragrance far and wide.'

1199
01:40:35,917 --> 01:40:39,042
'Be a wing.'

1200
01:40:39,167 --> 01:40:44,792
'The sky has no limits.
Fly among the clouds!'

1201
01:40:48,250 --> 01:40:54,125
'Can there by motherhood without pain?'

1202
01:40:54,250 --> 01:40:59,917
'Is there a boat which hasn't seen a storm?
Stand up and fight!'

1203
01:41:00,042 --> 01:41:02,792
'See pain?
Be the shoulder of comfort.'

1204
01:41:02,917 --> 01:41:05,875
'See fear?
Be the beacon of hope.'

1205
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:10,417
'See injustice?
Drive it away with your ideals!'

1206
01:41:12,667 --> 01:41:18,417
'Look above,
to find the stars...'

1207
01:41:18,542 --> 01:41:21,625
'...filling your eyes!'

1208
01:41:24,667 --> 01:41:32,292
'A good look you must take,
to find that life is a web of lies!'

1209
01:41:32,417 --> 01:41:33,792
Dad!
-Where's your mother?

1210
01:41:33,917 --> 01:41:34,917
Inside!

1211
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:38,750
Oh My Goodness!

1212
01:41:42,167 --> 01:41:44,542
Just hang in there, dear!
That's it!

1213
01:41:51,042 --> 01:41:52,042
Just hold on, dear!

1214
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:54,000
Do it, buddy!

1215
01:42:00,167 --> 01:42:01,500
Dad!

1216
01:42:01,625 --> 01:42:02,917
Fight him, dad!

1217
01:42:04,292 --> 01:42:05,917
I don't know how to fight, dear.

1218
01:42:06,042 --> 01:42:07,250
Get up!

1219
01:42:10,042 --> 01:42:11,042
Start walking!

1220
01:42:18,917 --> 01:42:19,917
Get him!

1221
01:42:29,250 --> 01:42:30,250
Grab her legs!

1222
01:42:42,042 --> 01:42:43,542
Dad...
-Don't go in there!

1223
01:43:00,792 --> 01:43:01,792
Dad!

1224
01:43:19,500 --> 01:43:20,500
Stop moving!

1225
01:43:24,917 --> 01:43:26,292
What are you all staring at?

1226
01:43:37,875 --> 01:43:38,875
Close your mouth.

1227
01:43:41,417 --> 01:43:42,417
Capture him!

1228
01:44:12,167 --> 01:44:13,167
Hold him tight!

1229
01:44:22,542 --> 01:44:23,542
Get out of the way!

1230
01:44:32,542 --> 01:44:33,542
Dad!

1231
01:44:46,167 --> 01:44:47,292
Damn you, uncle!

1232
01:45:49,667 --> 01:45:50,667
Let go of him.

1233
01:47:08,625 --> 01:47:09,667
Go and get a knife!

1234
01:47:21,125 --> 01:47:22,292
Let go!

1235
01:48:09,792 --> 01:48:11,042
It's time.
Let's go.

and set foot on solid ground.'

'We chopped and felled trees!
We dug wells and smashed boulders!'

'We built a house and told stories.
Closed our eyes and forgot the darkness.'
