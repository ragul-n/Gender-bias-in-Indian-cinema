1
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:19,771
THEAGEDAREN'T ALWAYS WISE, NOR DO
THE ELDERLYALWAYS UNDERSTAND
JUSTICE.

2
00:03:33,099 --> 00:03:35,634
The national security
bill was passed unanimously.

3
00:03:36,065 --> 00:03:38,233
Today, for first time in the
histoy of post independent India..

4
00:03:38,466 --> 00:03:40,167
..the trains have arrived on time.

5
00:03:40,532 --> 00:03:43,234
The president has praised
a state of emergency.

6
00:03:43,532 --> 00:03:47,002
He proclaimed that to fight
the conspiracy against the county..

7
00:03:47,332 --> 00:03:51,035
..by destructive powers, a declaration
of emergency was inevitable.

8
00:03:51,265 --> 00:03:52,566
He also said that as far
as the common man is concerned..

9
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:53,299
Hello!

10
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:56,168
..the declaration of emergency
has been historically beneficial.

11
00:03:56,332 --> 00:03:57,066
Okay.

12
00:03:58,366 --> 00:04:01,035
Okay. Okay.

13
00:04:02,632 --> 00:04:03,499
l'll tell him.

14
00:04:16,632 --> 00:04:19,735
Comrade, there was a phone
call from the party o_ice.

15
00:04:20,466 --> 00:04:22,067
The police are raiding
all the places.

16
00:04:22,165 --> 00:04:24,200
They have asked you to go into hiding.

17
00:04:24,432 --> 00:04:27,401
l'm too old to go into hiding!

18
00:04:27,499 --> 00:04:31,135
lt's all a nightmare of an old lady.

19
00:04:32,032 --> 00:04:34,734
Eveything will be fine.
Get me some blacktea.

20
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,402
l have some writing to do. - Ok.

21
00:04:55,232 --> 00:05:03,073
THE BOOK OF JOB

22
00:05:08,332 --> 00:05:12,269
Why does a man migrate
from his place of birth?

23
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,569
Because life is elsewhere.

24
00:05:16,299 --> 00:05:18,367
The British people drank tea
to sustain themselves in cold weather.

25
00:05:18,466 --> 00:05:20,534
When China stopped exporting
tea leaves to Britain..

26
00:05:20,733 --> 00:05:22,668
..they landed up in India.

27
00:05:23,265 --> 00:05:25,000
They started to find various
ways of cultivating tea..

28
00:05:25,099 --> 00:05:26,767
..leaves themselves,
to meet their needs.

29
00:05:27,366 --> 00:05:30,235
Thus, the British started
to arrive in Assam..

30
00:05:30,499 --> 00:05:33,068
..Nilgiri and Munnar
for cultivating tea.

31
00:05:35,032 --> 00:05:36,266
When this stoy was going on..

32
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:39,969
..l wasn't aware that
even l was a part of this stoy.

33
00:05:46,499 --> 00:05:49,635
The first agenda of Mr. Haryson was..

34
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:52,602
..to clearforest and
make roads for tea plantation.

35
00:06:09,532 --> 00:06:12,668
When men came from England
to get the work done..

36
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,304
..labourers came from Adimali
Theni and from tribal territories'.

37
00:06:18,232 --> 00:06:20,701
When they were scared and hesitant
of snakes, agents and supervisors..

38
00:06:20,799 --> 00:06:22,767
..beat them up and made them work.

39
00:06:28,699 --> 00:06:29,733
Thacho

40
00:07:03,733 --> 00:07:06,969
That boy was the discovey of
Mr. Haryson.

41
00:07:07,232 --> 00:07:10,068
The Englishman loved
him like his pet dog.

42
00:07:21,099 --> 00:07:22,333
He took him to the
Christian community..

43
00:07:22,432 --> 00:07:24,333
..and baptiMd him
in the Devikulam lake

44
00:07:24,632 --> 00:07:29,303
Maybe because he was a good worker
that Mr. Haryson named him as Job.

45
00:07:29,799 --> 00:07:30,699
Job!

46
00:07:32,265 --> 00:07:33,299
lyob.

47
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:50,769
When Job became a man,
the Englishman got him married.

48
00:07:51,432 --> 00:07:54,701
lt was then thatAnnamma
entered his life.

49
00:07:55,065 --> 00:07:57,767
l'm fed up.
You leave me alone all the time.

50
00:07:58,032 --> 00:08:00,200
You don't care about me.
l never see you.

51
00:08:00,299 --> 00:08:02,701
You just le_ me to rot in
this blasted jungle long enough..

52
00:08:02,799 --> 00:08:03,699
..and l want to leave.

53
00:08:04,432 --> 00:08:06,700
Within a few yean, Haryson's
wife got fed up with him and..

54
00:08:07,232 --> 00:08:11,102
..Munnar and went back to England.

55
00:08:32,132 --> 00:08:36,402
lt was at that time that Kazhali got
excommunicated from her community..

56
00:08:36,733 --> 00:08:40,236
..after being accused
for practicing black magic.

57
00:08:40,366 --> 00:08:42,735
She left Nilgiri and reached Munnar.

58
00:09:15,632 --> 00:09:18,434
The Englishman had
seen many beautiful women.

59
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,603
The glee that he had on his
face at that time when he saw her..

60
00:09:22,733 --> 00:09:25,068
..disappeared only after supper.

61
00:09:40,466 --> 00:09:43,769
lyob and Annamma had
three children by that time.

62
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,069
The Englishman named them a_er
the characters of his favorite novel.

63
00:09:48,466 --> 00:09:51,569
Dimitri, Ivan and Aloshy.

64
00:10:50,065 --> 00:10:53,268
Thacho didn't die of lyob's gunshot.

65
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:55,267
But was scared and
jumped offthe cliff.

66
00:11:05,699 --> 00:11:08,468
The Englishman brought
Kazhali back to his bungalow.

67
00:11:08,733 --> 00:11:13,070
ln those days,
instead of pesticides children were..

68
00:11:13,265 --> 00:11:15,200
.. used in fields.

69
00:11:15,432 --> 00:11:19,235
For all the
insects and rats that they caught..

70
00:11:19,532 --> 00:11:23,202
..the Englishman used to
throw coins sitting on his chair.

71
00:11:23,299 --> 00:11:25,401
Nearthat chair,
Kazhali Stood as an English lady..

72
00:11:25,532 --> 00:11:28,501
..in her new attire
and her new name as May

73
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:34,237
Being new Christians, lyob and Lazar
didn't like this new madam at all.

74
00:11:34,699 --> 00:11:38,469
When men were murmuring
in the portico, women were..

75
00:11:38,566 --> 00:11:43,070
..forging new bonds in the kitchen.

76
00:11:51,132 --> 00:11:55,436
During World War l, Haryson's
cargo of tea leaves didn't reach..

77
00:11:55,532 --> 00:11:59,168
..the destination and sank in the sea.

78
00:12:00,099 --> 00:12:02,434
Haryson had to face huge losses.

79
00:12:38,432 --> 00:12:41,268
Finally to collect his Dues,
the Englishman left for England..

80
00:12:41,432 --> 00:12:46,703
..a_er giving the power
of attorney to his faithful lyob.

81
00:13:18,566 --> 00:13:20,968
The Englishman who
had left for England..

82
00:13:21,065 --> 00:13:23,700
..died of a heart attack
as he reached Cochin.

83
00:13:24,733 --> 00:13:28,236
A_er meeting the
Englishman in Cochin..

84
00:13:28,332 --> 00:13:30,167
..lyob came back with stern decisions

85
00:13:39,766 --> 00:13:44,570
Out.. Get out.. - Leave me.

86
00:13:55,566 --> 00:13:58,669
Poor Kazhali.. - Go inside.

87
00:13:59,099 --> 00:14:00,133
Go inside. Go.

88
00:14:00,766 --> 00:14:04,402
You and your children
will die of madness.

89
00:14:06,666 --> 00:14:09,135
You wait and see. Wait and see.

90
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:28,534
l have also slogged in this soil.

91
00:14:29,566 --> 00:14:32,769
l have more rights
here than that slut.

92
00:14:33,332 --> 00:14:35,367
Why have you placed a mat on the bed?

93
00:14:35,699 --> 00:14:37,100
Maybe.. he is unfamiliar..

94
00:14:37,332 --> 00:14:39,434
..the child is unable
to sleep on the cotton mattress.

95
00:14:44,065 --> 00:14:47,034
She is pregnant.
It is a matter of mo lives.

96
00:14:47,132 --> 00:14:48,433
God won't forgive.

97
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:53,270
Haaaa..What a nuisance.

98
00:14:57,399 --> 00:15:00,168
That nightAnnamma couldn't sleep.

99
00:15:00,766 --> 00:15:05,103
Annamma was scared that Kazhali's
curse might hunt down her family.

100
00:15:09,566 --> 00:15:12,435
Annamma found peace in prayer.

101
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:15,167
As she didn't have
any daughter of her own..

102
00:15:15,265 --> 00:15:19,202
..she brought up the
housemaid as her own daughter.

103
00:15:20,766 --> 00:15:24,269
Without lyob's knowledge,
Annamma used to meet Kazhali.

104
00:15:25,099 --> 00:15:30,170
Their love grew to Aloshy
and Kazhali's daughter Martha also.

105
00:15:46,099 --> 00:15:50,269
ln that span of time, there
was a breakout of Malaria in Munnar..

106
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,033
..which claimed Annamma's life too.

107
00:15:53,265 --> 00:15:57,402
Forthe first time lyob was shaken.

108
00:15:59,499 --> 00:16:01,267
Mother! - Come.

109
00:16:02,432 --> 00:16:03,966
Leave. - Mother!

110
00:16:04,599 --> 00:16:05,733
Come.

111
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:07,699
Father.

112
00:16:18,766 --> 00:16:21,034
Mother.. mother..

113
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:26,534
WithoutAloshy even saying anything..

114
00:16:26,632 --> 00:16:29,735
..Martha knew what
he had in his mind .

115
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:52,502
lyob tried to teach his children
the life that he was faimiliar with.

116
00:16:56,232 --> 00:16:59,735
Aloshy, this is the opportunity. Hit.

117
00:17:01,599 --> 00:17:03,567
lfyou waste this minute,
you won't get him back.

118
00:17:24,399 --> 00:17:28,236
Gradually, lyob undentood
thatAloshy was not like him.

119
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,300
He was likeAnnamma.

120
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:48,234
Hey!

121
00:17:48,399 --> 00:17:51,602
ln that house
his life became more m'iserable.

122
00:17:52,766 --> 00:17:54,734
Don't hit me. Don't hit me. Father!

123
00:17:55,766 --> 00:18:00,103
Other than Martha the only other
companion thatAloshy had was Chemban.

124
00:18:00,466 --> 00:18:01,366
Chemba!

125
00:18:03,799 --> 00:18:05,367
l had gone to your house.

126
00:18:06,299 --> 00:18:07,433
There was no one to be seen there.

127
00:18:07,766 --> 00:18:11,035
They must have been inside.
All are su_ering from fever.

128
00:18:11,132 --> 00:18:12,066
There are boils all overthe body.

129
00:18:30,032 --> 00:18:31,566
Mother! Mother! - Its An epidemic.

130
00:18:31,699 --> 00:18:33,434
Let me know, if anyone
in nearby area suffers from it.

131
00:18:33,566 --> 00:18:34,700
ln those days..

132
00:18:34,766 --> 00:18:38,069
..if any family got a_ected
with epidemic..they were burnt alive.

133
00:18:38,132 --> 00:18:39,399
..with evil pleasure..

134
00:18:39,532 --> 00:18:42,234
He stood helplessly
and saw the plight.

135
00:18:42,332 --> 00:18:43,166
Chemba! - Father!

136
00:18:43,432 --> 00:18:46,234
They were affected with disease.
- Mother!

137
00:18:46,766 --> 00:18:48,501
Mother! Leave me.

138
00:18:51,265 --> 00:18:53,567
What is this, boy?
You're always after the cow!

139
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:55,501
Get lost bitch !!. - Come.

140
00:19:07,466 --> 00:19:09,534
Move from the way.
You are acting over smart.

141
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:12,034
l'll complain to your father. Come.

142
00:19:49,733 --> 00:19:51,468
Sister!

143
00:20:27,032 --> 00:20:31,069
ln that house, the servant girl's
death was considered natural.

144
00:20:32,032 --> 00:20:35,034
By sancti_ing the house,
bad omens vanished.

145
00:21:28,466 --> 00:21:32,269
AccidentlyAloshy happened
to see the recruitment process..

146
00:21:32,399 --> 00:21:35,068
..forthe Indian British Navy.

147
00:21:46,733 --> 00:21:48,734
ln order to fight many
wars for the British..

148
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:51,668
..like many others even Aloshy
joined them and began his journey.

149
00:24:47,799 --> 00:24:51,402
By the end ofWorld war Il, the
British started to descend the hills.

150
00:24:52,232 --> 00:24:55,768
lnto the turbulent world,
they swarm like ants.

151
00:24:56,399 --> 00:24:59,435
When they went away,
a new class appeared..

152
00:24:59,733 --> 00:25:01,701
..wearing their discarded attire.

153
00:25:02,165 --> 00:25:03,966
The local foreigner.

154
00:25:24,199 --> 00:25:26,301
Aloshy's letter from Mumbai.

155
00:25:27,766 --> 00:25:29,734
Nothing special.
Just the usual greetings.

156
00:25:41,399 --> 00:25:44,001
My youngest son is an
o_icer in the Royal Navy.

157
00:25:44,132 --> 00:25:47,168
lt is his letter. Aloshy.

158
00:25:47,432 --> 00:25:49,200
There is news.

159
00:25:50,733 --> 00:25:52,701
Madurai Muthu Ravuther's son..

160
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:55,368
..Angoor Ravuther and
brother has entered the forest.

161
00:26:00,733 --> 00:26:02,034
Call Ivan.

162
00:26:16,499 --> 00:26:17,366
Father.

163
00:26:21,232 --> 00:26:23,434
This time the Tamilian
must not cut the trees.

164
00:26:46,632 --> 00:26:48,367
lvan, don't create problems.
It is a government order.

165
00:26:48,466 --> 00:26:49,700
Move away. - Who are you?

166
00:26:53,232 --> 00:26:55,300
Don't die worthless.

167
00:26:55,599 --> 00:26:58,702
Gun has.. not only
a butt but a face also.

168
00:26:59,432 --> 00:27:02,635
Shemone !
Narayana! Take the timber lory home.

169
00:27:04,332 --> 00:27:06,400
Tell brother Ravuther to
come home and meet our father.

170
00:27:06,532 --> 00:27:10,068
Until then, let the boy pluck tea
Ieaves with the girls in our estate.

171
00:27:56,432 --> 00:27:59,067
Hey, they are bringing timber.

172
00:28:07,232 --> 00:28:10,535
Where are you going
all dressed up so early?

173
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,102
How is it going to make
a difference to you , Slut!

174
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:25,368
What to do?
So many people are mobbing..

175
00:28:25,466 --> 00:28:29,069
..like ants from Kottayam and Vaikom.

176
00:28:30,699 --> 00:28:32,367
What to do, Boss?

177
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:36,669
They are building houses
in those places which we acquire.

178
00:28:46,499 --> 00:28:48,133
Where are you going?

179
00:28:48,699 --> 00:28:51,568
Outside. To check our boundaries.

180
00:28:53,366 --> 00:28:54,500
Go..go..

181
00:30:36,132 --> 00:30:38,567
What is it?

182
00:30:38,699 --> 00:30:41,368
Go away.. Run away, swine !

183
00:30:41,432 --> 00:30:46,637
Run away.
Run. Go away. We know who you are.

184
00:30:46,733 --> 00:30:48,534
We'll deal with you.

185
00:30:49,065 --> 00:30:50,232
Run away.

186
00:32:00,366 --> 00:32:01,734

This is my uncle. - Sit down.

189
00:32:21,366 --> 00:32:25,069
Sir.. this is government order.

190
00:32:26,232 --> 00:32:29,435
This is more than enough
to cut trees in the forest.

191
00:32:29,733 --> 00:32:31,367
lt is not enough.

192
00:32:32,065 --> 00:32:36,035
This is not enough to cutdown
trees in the Munnar forest, Ravuther.

193
00:32:49,265 --> 00:32:54,003
You are farmen who
stand rooted on earth.

194
00:32:54,666 --> 00:32:59,771
You can talk strongly.
But we are businessmen.

195
00:33:00,132 --> 00:33:02,100
We don't stand rooted at any place.

196
00:33:02,699 --> 00:33:06,102
We can do some compromises.

197
00:33:14,265 --> 00:33:17,234
l have brought a gi_ for you
Sir,from Malaya.

198
00:33:20,065 --> 00:33:21,499

Jasmine.

200
00:33:27,799 --> 00:33:28,766
Jasmine.

201
00:33:35,366 --> 00:33:41,004
We've cutdown trees since
the days of our anceston.

202
00:33:44,199 --> 00:33:49,404
Timber is our main business.
We have a big family in Madurai.

203
00:33:50,766 --> 00:33:53,668
Please don't create trouble.

204
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:59,603
Let us compromise.

205
00:34:00,199 --> 00:34:02,167
You have cutdown
trees all these years.

206
00:34:03,099 --> 00:34:03,732
No more.

207
00:34:04,366 --> 00:34:05,500
No need to do it .

208
00:34:07,766 --> 00:34:09,200
Don't cutdown trees.

209
00:34:11,065 --> 00:34:13,100
You can take your brother and leave.

210
00:34:13,666 --> 00:34:16,769
There are no tea leaves here.
Else, l would have served you tea.

211
00:34:17,232 --> 00:34:18,066
You leave.

212
00:34:32,733 --> 00:34:34,568
Okay, let us see.

213
00:34:36,599 --> 00:34:41,203
Boy, while leaving..
take that box with you.

214
00:34:41,299 --> 00:34:43,768
Before coming here, you
should have asked your father..

215
00:34:44,065 --> 00:34:46,434
..Muthu Ravuther as to know who lyob is.

216
00:34:46,599 --> 00:34:48,434
You could have avoided this trip.

217
00:34:51,733 --> 00:34:57,538
Four months back,
uncle and l, killed my father.

218
00:34:58,099 --> 00:35:01,035
Six..yes, six.

219
00:35:03,399 --> 00:35:05,534
He won't let us do anything new.

220
00:35:07,132 --> 00:35:09,701
l killed him. Now it is peaceful.

221
00:36:21,566 --> 00:36:23,534
Why do you have to waste time?

222
00:36:53,766 --> 00:36:55,734
Call Dimitri. - Okay.

223
00:37:19,032 --> 00:37:22,235
lvan and men are going
to clearthe settlers.

224
00:37:23,032 --> 00:37:27,069
By tomorrow dawn not a single
person should remain in that hill.

225
00:37:27,366 --> 00:37:29,401
Your remaining frustration
can be shown there.

226
00:37:46,332 --> 00:37:47,399
Aaaaa..

227
00:37:49,432 --> 00:37:51,000
Hey! Leave my daughter.

228
00:37:51,099 --> 00:37:54,168
Leave her. Don't harm her.

229
00:37:54,766 --> 00:37:56,734
Aaaa! Come, dear.

230
00:37:57,099 --> 00:38:00,702
Run. Run away. Oh!

231
00:38:01,065 --> 00:38:03,400
Run, children. Run.

232
00:38:22,165 --> 00:38:25,067
We are coming from valley.
They burnt down our house.

233
00:38:25,466 --> 00:38:27,067
Whatever it is,
you come in the morning.

234
00:38:27,165 --> 00:38:29,567
There is no one here right now.
- Don't say like that.

235
00:38:29,733 --> 00:38:32,569
You should go now and
come tomorrow. l'm going.

236
00:38:39,265 --> 00:38:42,267
Come, let us go. Run.

237
00:39:16,132 --> 00:39:18,667
As per the law enacted in
the year 1942, anyone can enter..

238
00:39:18,766 --> 00:39:20,968
..the forest and build a house.

239
00:39:21,265 --> 00:39:24,067
But ifyou step on the
Iand marked by land lords..

240
00:39:24,132 --> 00:39:25,233
..they'll beat and drive us away.

241
00:39:25,366 --> 00:39:26,734
But won't there be
any changes in this..

242
00:39:26,799 --> 00:39:28,066
..if the priest interveins?

243
00:39:28,165 --> 00:39:30,467
Changes won't come from baptizing.

244
00:39:30,566 --> 00:39:32,768
lt will come only
when people stand united.

245
00:39:34,132 --> 00:39:36,300
The comraday about
which Rosamma told..

246
00:39:36,399 --> 00:39:38,267
..didn't happen in Munnarthat time.

247
00:39:38,399 --> 00:39:40,100
lt happened in Mumbai.

248
00:39:40,232 --> 00:39:42,033
Naval Mutiny.

249
00:39:42,265 --> 00:39:46,035
On 1946 Februay 18th in
British Royal Indian Navy 20,OOO..

250
00:39:46,099 --> 00:39:53,206
..soldiers started a protest
Against the British government .

251
00:39:53,532 --> 00:39:55,500
All those soldiers
who participated in..

252
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:57,567
..that revolution were
dismissed from the Navy.

253
00:39:57,632 --> 00:40:01,235
Among them,
mo ofthem landed in Cochin.

254
00:40:01,332 --> 00:40:04,702
They were comrade Aloshy
and comrade P.J. Antony.

255
00:41:24,065 --> 00:41:26,534
This has been lying
here for a vey long time.

256
00:41:28,032 --> 00:41:31,034
The Englishman in the port
gave this here and went for war.

257
00:41:32,132 --> 00:41:34,133
He never returned.

258
00:41:38,299 --> 00:41:39,233
Keep it there.

259
00:41:49,065 --> 00:41:52,101
l'm going to start a drama
school here in Panchalam.

260
00:41:54,265 --> 00:41:55,532
You should have been an actor?

261
00:42:09,366 --> 00:42:12,502
You can come here anytime,
with orwithout a consort.

262
00:42:13,799 --> 00:42:15,567
What was her name?

263
00:42:18,099 --> 00:42:19,066
Martha.

264
00:45:49,165 --> 00:45:50,432
Why are they here?

265
00:45:50,632 --> 00:45:52,200
We have come to speak
on behalf ofthem.

266
00:45:52,432 --> 00:45:54,400
Why? can't they talk on their own?

267
00:45:56,099 --> 00:46:00,169
Father, l don't want to listen to any
arguments of those who don't work.

268
00:46:01,499 --> 00:46:08,205
lyob agreed to this meeting
only because we all believe in Jesus.

269
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:11,602
lt is right.
Who asked them to come here?

270
00:46:12,499 --> 00:46:14,567
We believers in
God must stand united.

271
00:46:15,232 --> 00:46:17,701
lnstead of that if you listen
to the words ofthose who have..

272
00:46:17,799 --> 00:46:20,168
..no fearfor God,
Will end up straying.

273
00:46:21,132 --> 00:46:22,399
You please go outside.

274
00:46:27,065 --> 00:46:27,965
Let us go.

275
00:46:33,733 --> 00:46:36,735
Boss is vey keen on the land,
which you occupy.

276
00:46:37,132 --> 00:46:40,068
Why don't you settle
in the southern hill?

277
00:46:40,165 --> 00:46:42,100
There is no waterthere, father.
It is dense forest.

278
00:46:42,199 --> 00:46:47,737
Yes. Then let them
settle in that land itself as tenants.

279
00:46:48,099 --> 00:46:48,766
They are poor people.

280
00:46:49,032 --> 00:46:52,101
l see. If it was tenancy,
You should have told that earlier.

281
00:47:00,165 --> 00:47:05,136
Poor are blessed.
because heaven belongs to them.

282
00:47:05,733 --> 00:47:08,569
ln that case you all can...

283
00:48:14,566 --> 00:48:15,700
Who is he?

284
00:48:15,766 --> 00:48:17,067
Haven't i told you, father?

285
00:48:18,366 --> 00:48:22,369
My youngest son who
fled the county. Aloshy.

286
00:48:23,532 --> 00:48:25,634
On the arrival ofthe prodigal son..

287
00:48:25,766 --> 00:48:28,068
..you must serve a feast
by butchering a well grown cow.

288
00:48:33,366 --> 00:48:37,069
You must be feeling tired.. Go..
Take rest in your old room.

289
00:49:55,666 --> 00:49:56,666
What the hell is this?

290
00:50:38,366 --> 00:50:40,234
Were you in the army all these years?

00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:01,600
ls it so?

295
00:51:38,099 --> 00:51:39,667

00:51:41,699 --> 00:51:43,167
Where to? Bombay?

298
00:51:43,332 --> 00:51:44,132
No.

299
00:51:44,699 --> 00:51:45,733
l have friends in Cochin.

300
00:51:46,132 --> 00:51:47,066
For what?

301
00:51:47,632 --> 00:51:48,766
What is wrong if you stay here?

302
00:51:49,766 --> 00:51:52,735
Take yourtime and think over it.
You can decide later.

303
00:51:54,499 --> 00:51:58,736
Laar, take him around
and show our places. - Okay.

304
00:52:06,265 --> 00:52:08,033

Till there.
All those hills belong to us.

00:52:26,566 --> 00:52:27,600
..she is mad.

308
00:52:43,566 --> 00:52:44,667
That is Kazhali's daughter.

309
00:52:45,099 --> 00:52:46,400
Don't look at her,
she has evil spell.

310
00:53:15,399 --> 00:53:17,033
Lazar, take him away.

311
00:53:24,699 --> 00:53:25,699

00:56:05,532 --> 00:56:06,666
Kazhali is vey sick.

318

She works and looks after her mother.

319
00:56:10,366 --> 00:56:12,468
People here say that both mother
and daughter practice black magic.

320
00:56:13,265 --> 00:56:15,467
So no one enten
their house out offear.

00:59:22,399 --> 00:59:24,467
She blew something,
spat on the sand and walked away.

347
00:59:24,666 --> 00:59:27,068
Till last night
he was pemectly fine.

348
00:59:27,432 --> 00:59:30,501
By this morning, he is unable
to move his left hand and leg.

349
00:59:32,799 --> 00:59:35,301
Sounds like black magic.

350
00:59:37,566 --> 00:59:39,067
Go to the hospital and see a doctor.

351
00:59:39,232 --> 00:59:40,533
There is no use.

352
00:59:44,199 --> 00:59:46,034
Teresa, look .

353
00:59:47,232 --> 00:59:48,366
Stop there.

354
00:59:49,466 --> 00:59:50,733
l'm telling you to stop there.

355
00:59:51,766 --> 00:59:55,336
You evil witch !
What did you do to make him so sick?

356
00:59:55,632 --> 00:59:57,333
lf you do such things
which are against God..

357
00:59:57,399 --> 00:59:59,334
..cuned snake will bite you.

358
01:00:00,099 --> 01:00:02,768
You'll be doomed. Oh!

359
01:00:26,566 --> 01:00:27,300
Come.

360
01:00:27,733 --> 01:00:30,235
Saw that !!
Saw that !! Black magic woman.

361
01:00:40,332 --> 01:00:42,967
You must be aware of all the things
that are happening in our county.

362
01:00:44,065 --> 01:00:46,267
Eveyone says that
the British will leave.

363
01:00:47,132 --> 01:00:49,534
Maybe we'll get
independent Travancore.

364
01:00:50,566 --> 01:00:53,268
Otherwise some jobless
advocates may rule us.

365
01:00:54,099 --> 01:00:56,634
Whatever it may be
orwhatever happens..

366
01:00:56,733 --> 01:00:58,534
..we must only look after ourselves.

367
01:00:59,099 --> 01:01:00,533
Tomorrow itselftake ourworken..

368
01:01:00,666 --> 01:01:02,701
.. Ieave for eastern
hill and mark our boundaries.

369
01:01:03,165 --> 01:01:05,133
You do know the place and
where to put the base?

370
01:01:05,265 --> 01:01:06,099
l know, father.

371
01:01:08,032 --> 01:01:09,666
l'm saying this foryou too, Aloshy.

372
01:01:11,566 --> 01:01:13,267
Why are you sitting like
this with your head down?

373
01:01:15,566 --> 01:01:19,603
Do you see that hill far away?
It is all ours.

374
01:01:20,232 --> 01:01:22,067
We conquered that after
fighting with earth.

375
01:01:23,566 --> 01:01:26,201
You always run,
when faced with problems.

376
01:01:27,065 --> 01:01:28,533
l don't want this hill
and mountain, father.

377
01:01:29,299 --> 01:01:32,068
As you said the
situation is changing.

378
01:01:33,099 --> 01:01:34,233
You must also
understand that, father.

379
01:01:34,299 --> 01:01:35,466
Hey , give respect.

380
01:01:36,199 --> 01:01:37,433
Talk to him properly.

381
01:01:38,132 --> 01:01:39,733
You may be a big
o_icer back in Bombay.

382
01:01:40,299 --> 01:01:41,967
But here you'll have
to obey your father.

383
01:01:45,733 --> 01:01:46,567
lvan!

384
01:01:51,265 --> 01:01:53,667
Who allowed this wretched
woman inside? Throw her out.

385
01:01:57,499 --> 01:02:00,235
What do you want here? Get out.

386
01:02:02,766 --> 01:02:04,234
Get out from here.

387
01:02:05,666 --> 01:02:08,035
l told you to get up and go.

388
01:02:10,099 --> 01:02:11,066
Get up.

389
01:02:11,199 --> 01:02:14,635
lvan ! Move aside. - Leave him.

390
01:02:15,532 --> 01:02:18,167
Leave. Move away.

391
01:02:31,232 --> 01:02:32,733
Take your mother and go.

392
01:05:33,766 --> 01:05:37,069
Aha! There is an egg too.
What is this called?

393
01:05:37,432 --> 01:05:38,065
Biriyani.

394
01:05:39,432 --> 01:05:40,599
What kind of a name is this?

395
01:05:40,766 --> 01:05:43,468
Viriyani. - It is Biriyani.

396
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:48,700
Careful.

397
01:05:49,766 --> 01:05:51,267
lffather comes to know about this,
it'll be a problem.

398
01:05:55,099 --> 01:06:00,370
lvan, fint you come
out ofyourfather's feet.

399
01:06:09,432 --> 01:06:12,067
Are you kids with a mustache?

400
01:06:15,499 --> 01:06:16,533
What a foam?

401
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:46,101
Don't hit me.

402
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,402
Stop! l told you to stop.

403
01:06:57,599 --> 01:06:58,366
Stop!

404
01:06:59,532 --> 01:07:01,967
Aloshy! Aloshy! - Chemba! Chemba!

405
01:07:02,099 --> 01:07:04,067
Cheeru, Aloshy. Cheeru..

406
01:07:10,766 --> 01:07:12,667
What are you doing here?
Go and mind your own business.

407
01:07:25,799 --> 01:07:26,766
Hey!

408
01:07:27,666 --> 01:07:29,534
We iust.. iust friendship.

409
01:07:52,199 --> 01:07:52,732
Come.

410
01:08:01,766 --> 01:08:03,434
We are moving into the forest.

411
01:08:03,799 --> 01:08:06,034
l know how to protect
them from wild animals.

412
01:08:06,432 --> 01:08:07,566
We may not meet again, Aloshy.

413
01:08:08,733 --> 01:08:12,069
Your siblings are like wolves,
Aloshy. Take care.

414
01:08:40,032 --> 01:08:43,502
Not eveyone can leave
without saying goodbye.

415
01:08:45,432 --> 01:08:46,432
l'm leaving this place.

416
01:08:53,532 --> 01:08:55,333
Once l ran away from
here when my mother died.

417
01:08:59,132 --> 01:09:00,399
This time,
l came here to leave again.

418
01:09:05,799 --> 01:09:07,133
With you.

419
01:09:35,699 --> 01:09:38,034
Greetings! - Greetings, son!

420
01:09:46,632 --> 01:09:49,968
Father, this is Chako sir.
He is from Pala.

421
01:09:50,499 --> 01:09:54,603
He wants to talk to you.
- An elephant is on the loose.

422
01:09:54,666 --> 01:09:57,435
This gun is to drive it away.

423
01:09:58,099 --> 01:10:00,334
Go ahead. What is the matter?
Have you heard about sir's family?

424
01:10:01,499 --> 01:10:05,636
Kurushingal.
A big family. They are patriots too.

425
01:10:06,632 --> 01:10:10,469
Nowadays he has great
interest in serving people.

426
01:10:10,799 --> 01:10:13,234
Eveyone says that he
must contest in the election.

427
01:10:13,666 --> 01:10:17,036
lt is vey expensive,
cant take it from the family.

428
01:10:17,265 --> 01:10:21,569
So you must help him
to start one cultivation.

429
01:10:21,799 --> 01:10:23,600
lt is all for the county's good.

430
01:10:24,632 --> 01:10:25,566
What kind of cultivation is it?

431
01:10:26,265 --> 01:10:27,466
Little Gania.

432
01:10:28,065 --> 01:10:31,568
That is why we are in need of help.
It is all for the county.

433
01:10:33,766 --> 01:10:35,634
lfyou don't agree, lyob..

434
01:10:35,766 --> 01:10:37,334
..l'll have to enter the forest..

435
01:10:37,432 --> 01:10:39,233
..and do the business
with Tamilians from Theni.

436
01:10:39,699 --> 01:10:42,601
Speaking about it, lyob
is not from a prestigious family.

437
01:10:42,699 --> 01:10:46,602
l am a newly convert. But l won't be
a partner in this kind of business.

438
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:50,103
You are from a prestigious
family and doing ganja cultivation.

439
01:10:52,799 --> 01:10:57,403
You leave, sir. Next time
when you come, you must have tea.

440
01:11:10,766 --> 01:11:13,468
Natives here say that you
are a great black magician.

441
01:11:14,766 --> 01:11:18,369
Here, It is not just me, even a poor
black cat and..

442
01:11:18,632 --> 01:11:20,700
.. wild foul also bear
this bad name.

443
01:11:27,699 --> 01:11:28,566
What is it?

444
01:11:36,199 --> 01:11:37,233
Come.

445
01:12:04,733 --> 01:12:05,633
Martha..

446
01:13:53,032 --> 01:13:54,433
Didn't that elephant
make quite a noise?

447
01:13:54,599 --> 01:13:57,401
l can't stop thinking about it.
- What is the point?

448
01:13:57,599 --> 01:13:59,968
All it took for father was
a bullet to kill the elephant.

449
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,402
Boss's gun belongs to the Englishman.
That is why it is so accurate .

450
01:14:04,299 --> 01:14:08,369
We use a .303 rifle even now.
It is absolutely useless.

451
01:14:08,466 --> 01:14:10,401
The other day, l heard a
man giving speech at the junction.

452
01:14:11,299 --> 01:14:16,404
America has bombed Japan. Did
you hear about it? - Yea, yea heard.

453
01:14:16,799 --> 01:14:19,067
They are using atom
Bomb and we are still stuck with.303.

454
01:14:19,265 --> 01:14:20,165
What is the use?

455
01:14:21,032 --> 01:14:22,466
lt is high time for us
to start using atom bombs here.

456
01:14:23,332 --> 01:14:25,400
lfthere is any kind of problem,
we must blow one immediately.

457
01:14:26,432 --> 01:14:28,634
We will neither change nor progress.

458
01:14:29,065 --> 01:14:30,666
Maathupillai police, don't say that.

459
01:14:31,132 --> 01:14:32,433
We do have seen a lot of changes.

460
01:14:32,699 --> 01:14:38,237
Electricity,
vehicle, binocular, wireless.

461
01:14:38,299 --> 01:14:39,667
Now this torch.

462
01:14:43,299 --> 01:14:45,167
There is something else..
something new in the market.

463
01:14:45,599 --> 01:14:47,400
Biriyani. - What is that?

464
01:14:48,399 --> 01:14:52,770
A dish made out of ghee,
masala, egg and chicken.

465
01:14:53,099 --> 01:14:54,200
Don't tell anyone.

466
01:15:16,632 --> 01:15:19,201
Kazhali! Kazhali!

467
01:15:19,666 --> 01:15:21,000
What happened?

468
01:15:53,099 --> 01:15:54,066
Bread.

469
01:16:02,332 --> 01:16:03,466
Aloshy!

470
01:16:31,265 --> 01:16:32,332
Read it out.

471
01:16:32,766 --> 01:16:35,268
This letter is.. - Speakto the point.

472
01:16:36,466 --> 01:16:39,035
This is the report
of the Naval Mutiny in Bombay.

473
01:16:39,399 --> 01:16:44,303
Royal Navy has condemned Aloshy for
revolting against the British Queen.

474
01:16:44,366 --> 01:16:45,300
Enough.

475
01:16:46,032 --> 01:16:48,667
Even now, the food that
you eat and the house..

476
01:16:49,065 --> 01:16:51,267
..that you live
in were given by them.

477
01:16:51,766 --> 01:16:54,368
l am a subject of British Queen
and their principles. Do you know?

478
01:16:59,599 --> 01:17:02,301
Aloshy, are you a communist?

479
01:17:04,432 --> 01:17:08,068
And, what do you have to do with
that prostitutes daughter?

480
01:17:08,332 --> 01:17:12,269
She is my mother's friend's daughter.
Martha is my friend.

481
01:17:13,132 --> 01:17:15,400
Do you want me to
explain further as to..

482
01:17:16,432 --> 01:17:17,666
..how she is connected
with this house?

483
01:17:24,265 --> 01:17:24,965
Father!

484
01:17:25,666 --> 01:17:27,434
Have you grown so big
to go against your dad?

485
01:17:27,799 --> 01:17:29,967
Take your hands o_, Ivan.
Take your hands o_. - Hey!

486
01:17:30,099 --> 01:17:31,066
l told you to take your hands off.

487
01:17:32,566 --> 01:17:33,266
Move away.

488
01:17:34,232 --> 01:17:38,369
You don't touch my children.
They have always stood by me..

489
01:17:38,432 --> 01:17:40,267
Have you ever thought
why l was never here?

490
01:17:41,032 --> 01:17:42,400
The girl who was brought
up by my mother as her..

491
01:17:42,499 --> 01:17:43,266
..own daughter was seen
hanging in this vey own house.

492
01:17:43,399 --> 01:17:44,233
Should l narrate
eveything from then.

493
01:17:50,265 --> 01:17:51,466
Get out..

494
01:17:52,265 --> 01:17:54,233
There was no problem
when you weren't here.

495
01:17:55,232 --> 01:17:57,100
Get out from here. Go away.

496
01:18:06,065 --> 01:18:07,232
Laar! - Yes.

497
01:18:07,499 --> 01:18:09,567
Ask the surveyor
to come here early in the morning.

498
01:18:09,733 --> 01:18:11,334
We shall divide
the propem tomorrow.

499
01:18:28,499 --> 01:18:31,034
Son, father told
all that in the rage.

500
01:18:31,232 --> 01:18:32,399
Once his anger subsides,
he'll be alright.

501
01:18:32,532 --> 01:18:34,767
What will become alright?
l have no problem.

502
01:18:35,232 --> 01:18:37,200
Just take care of dad. Make sure
that my brothers don't harm him.

503
01:19:00,099 --> 01:19:01,567
l have some friends in Cochin.

504
01:19:02,799 --> 01:19:04,634
l'll go set things in place
and come back.

505
01:19:09,566 --> 01:19:10,633
Martha, have you
seen the ocean before?

506
01:19:36,065 --> 01:19:39,034
You must tighten mo
rods here like this.

507
01:19:39,132 --> 01:19:43,102
Then you must pull
and tie it like this.

508
01:19:43,632 --> 01:19:47,002
A_er that should buy
it in 2 and halffinger deep mud.

509
01:19:47,165 --> 01:19:50,101
The pigs will come
running and step on it.

510
01:19:51,032 --> 01:19:54,001
This sharp rod will pierce through the
pig's mouth and come out of its back.

511
01:19:56,632 --> 01:19:58,400
That pig must not come back.

512
01:24:43,399 --> 01:24:46,568
House, estate and hill must be
equally divided into two. Isn't it?

513
01:24:49,099 --> 01:24:51,134
Are you not having 3 children?

514
01:24:52,132 --> 01:24:53,166
Then what about the youngest son?

515
01:24:59,265 --> 01:25:00,165
He died.

516
01:26:46,099 --> 01:26:47,200
Aloshy!

517
01:26:48,265 --> 01:26:49,432
Aloshy!

518
01:28:10,599 --> 01:28:12,200
His fever is not subsiding.

519
01:28:12,632 --> 01:28:14,600
From somewhere,
infection is spreading.

520
01:28:16,032 --> 01:28:18,734
lfthis continues, l don't
think he'll survive the night.

521
01:29:50,366 --> 01:29:53,469
The Tamilians from Theni and Chako
master are cultivating ganja here.

522
01:29:54,332 --> 01:29:55,633
We came to work here.

523
01:29:57,499 --> 01:29:58,700
Where else can we go?

524
01:30:03,499 --> 01:30:04,366
Medicinal potion.

525
01:30:12,099 --> 01:30:14,034
But Tamilians will
never grab our women.

526
01:30:32,466 --> 01:30:34,501
Eating this aphrodisiac seed does not
benefit me in anyway.

527
01:30:35,232 --> 01:30:38,568
Though, l take this in large quantity,
it is still not wo_ing.

528
01:30:39,532 --> 01:30:41,000
There is no movement.

529
01:30:43,699 --> 01:30:45,634
You are a real man.

530
01:30:46,632 --> 01:30:49,101
All your body parts
are functioning pe_ectly.

531
01:30:49,666 --> 01:30:51,234
So that is not the matter.

532
01:30:54,399 --> 01:30:56,701
Someone is doing evil magic on you.

533
01:30:57,599 --> 01:31:00,668
You understand? Something evil...hmmm

534
01:31:19,466 --> 01:31:21,034
Go away, rascals.

535
01:32:01,599 --> 01:32:06,303
Dimitri didn't have to think much to
undentand who had done black magic on him.

536
01:32:17,132 --> 01:32:18,066
Hamos.

537
01:36:12,466 --> 01:36:15,368
Chako sir is a patriot.

538
01:36:15,733 --> 01:36:17,601
Have you not heard about his family?

539
01:36:18,065 --> 01:36:20,434
Kurisingal. They have..
- Do Kurisingal family people..

540
01:36:20,632 --> 01:36:22,433
..have separate graveyard
in church cemetey?

541
01:36:25,532 --> 01:36:27,133
ln future you leave the Tamilians.

542
01:36:27,399 --> 01:36:29,167
We'll deliver the
stu_ in Kodaikanal.

543
01:36:30,065 --> 01:36:31,666
Business will be
done by those who work.

544
01:36:32,532 --> 01:36:35,301
Else this whole cultivation
Will be set on fire.

545
01:36:39,065 --> 01:36:41,200
We also have patriotism.

546
01:36:41,632 --> 01:36:42,566
Not that, son.

547
01:36:43,132 --> 01:36:44,566
All this goes into election fund.

548
01:36:45,032 --> 01:36:46,032
l'm not your son.

549
01:36:46,566 --> 01:36:49,068
l'm lyob's third son, Aloshy.

550
01:37:17,265 --> 01:37:19,166
Without getting into a fight..

551
01:37:19,566 --> 01:37:22,635
..By avoiding mainland, Aloshy paved a
mountain path from Munnar to Kodaikanal.

552
01:37:23,265 --> 01:37:25,700
Hence, without any help from Tamilians,
he delivered the stu_..

553
01:37:25,799 --> 01:37:28,568
.. to the Irish foreigners in Kodaikanal.

554
01:37:51,332 --> 01:37:53,067
Why have you brought it here?

555
01:37:53,499 --> 01:37:55,234
Madam told me to give it here.

556
01:37:56,399 --> 01:37:57,733
She said ,there are guests outside.

557
01:38:42,599 --> 01:38:44,267
What is this Tamilian
doing on this chair?

558
01:38:47,165 --> 01:38:48,199
Get up.

559
01:38:50,599 --> 01:38:54,235
Father! Ravuther has
come on my invitation.

560
01:38:55,532 --> 01:38:57,300
We had to talk some business.

561
01:38:57,432 --> 01:38:59,734
What business do you
have with this stinker?

562
01:39:00,432 --> 01:39:01,699
You looktired, father.

563
01:39:01,766 --> 01:39:05,202
You go inside.
We'll look after our matter.

564
01:39:12,566 --> 01:39:16,703
Don't make people say
that we hit our own father.

565
01:39:20,599 --> 01:39:21,399
Come, master.

566
01:40:01,532 --> 01:40:03,400
You have to fear
your children, master.

567
01:40:03,799 --> 01:40:05,600
Because they are your children.

568
01:40:07,366 --> 01:40:10,402
You know lyob that l
have always stood by masters.

569
01:40:10,566 --> 01:40:13,535
Foreigner, lyob and now Ivan.

570
01:40:14,432 --> 01:40:16,367
Whoever might come or go..

571
01:40:17,032 --> 01:40:19,334
..Laar will be on the
right side of that chair.

572
01:40:21,366 --> 01:40:23,067
lt is the benefit of going to school.

573
01:40:34,399 --> 01:40:36,234
Travancore was changing.

574
01:40:37,232 --> 01:40:42,003
The opposition against British
rule and Divan was rising.

575
01:40:42,766 --> 01:40:47,770
Sir. C. P. imported Nazi
devotee Ganapathy lyerfrom..

576
01:40:48,232 --> 01:40:50,601
..Madras to Munnar to clear up..

577
01:40:50,666 --> 01:40:53,635
..communists who had taken
special training in this.

578
01:40:54,399 --> 01:40:59,570
lyer turned a tea
factoy into his camp.

579
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:05,069
Rosamma, Mani Asan and
some other comrades got caught.

580
01:41:05,265 --> 01:41:07,200
They were brutally beaten up.

581
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:09,400
Greetings, buddy!

582
01:41:09,499 --> 01:41:14,170
lyer and Ramher buddies
who had studied together..

583
01:41:14,232 --> 01:41:15,099
..in Madras Christian college.

584
01:41:15,232 --> 01:41:17,500
Sir when l went to inspect
the border they threw stones at me.

585
01:41:20,099 --> 01:41:23,368
Ravuther and lyob's
children betrayed us.

586
01:41:24,332 --> 01:41:29,770
l decided to meetAloshy,
the only other enemy of our enemy.

587
01:41:58,599 --> 01:42:02,970
l know that mo people who took part
in the Bombay Naval Mutiny landed in Cochin.

588
01:42:04,265 --> 01:42:07,067
Comrade P.J.Antony
and comrade Aloshy.

589
01:42:09,199 --> 01:42:13,269
ln short span oftime.. you have
become a known outlaw in Munnar.

590
01:42:14,132 --> 01:42:16,100
Don't know why this change happened?

591
01:42:17,432 --> 01:42:20,301
At times when there
are no laws, offence is

592
01:42:20,766 --> 01:42:22,000
..the biggest resistance.

593
01:42:38,432 --> 01:42:42,402
Till last night, it was a healthy cow.

594
01:42:43,032 --> 01:42:43,766
Now it is lying like this.

595
01:42:44,332 --> 01:42:46,467
With that Dimitri decided mo things.

596
01:42:46,799 --> 01:42:50,302
One is that black
magic was done by Martha.

597
01:42:50,599 --> 01:42:56,671
Second on getting a chance
he'll shatter her head.

598
01:44:24,733 --> 01:44:26,701
Ghost. l'm sure.

599
01:44:27,199 --> 01:44:28,066
lt was Aloshy.

600
01:44:29,199 --> 01:44:31,100
Keep quiet, brother.
Don't talk nonsense.

601
01:44:31,199 --> 01:44:34,201
No, man.
His leg didn't touch the ground.

602
01:44:34,766 --> 01:44:37,735
lt is her. That black
magician has revived his soul.

603
01:44:38,232 --> 01:44:40,167
God, there is no
use of your existence.

604
01:44:41,599 --> 01:44:45,069
Shall we call the priest
from the church and sanctify?

605
01:44:45,265 --> 01:44:46,399
Madness.

606
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:48,534
Shemon, come.

607
01:51:28,733 --> 01:51:31,268
Shemon, he is a fint class shooter !

608
01:52:41,499 --> 01:52:43,000
That swine! tried to kill me.

609
01:52:43,099 --> 01:52:45,968
lf l'm a man, l would kill him
and hang him in front ofthis house.

610
01:52:46,499 --> 01:52:47,166
Who?

611
01:52:48,065 --> 01:52:48,698
Who is it?

612
01:52:49,733 --> 01:52:51,267
Locals are saying many things.

613
01:52:52,299 --> 01:52:54,434
lvan and his men together
tried to kill Aloshy.

614
01:52:54,566 --> 01:52:56,367
As they couldn't
succeed they sent Hamos.

615
01:52:56,632 --> 01:52:59,267
Hamos was killed byAloshy. -Aloshy?

616
01:53:00,299 --> 01:53:01,700
Those are rumours.

617
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,402
lfthis continues,
they will end up killing each other.

618
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:20,969
Why are you not laughing now?
You were laughing so much.

619
01:53:21,099 --> 01:53:22,667
laugh.. - Stop it, brother.

620
01:53:22,733 --> 01:53:24,067
Give me some peace.

621
01:53:24,332 --> 01:53:26,367
Who asked you to enter my room?

622
01:53:30,232 --> 01:53:31,266
Do you enter my room?

623
01:53:34,165 --> 01:53:36,634
Tell me. When l'm not here
do you enter my room, you dog?

624
01:54:44,399 --> 01:54:46,434
People are saying
that Dimitri is dead.

625
01:56:09,265 --> 01:56:12,301
Sir, relax.

626
01:56:12,566 --> 01:56:13,700
You need not wory.

627
01:56:14,466 --> 01:56:16,434
l have made an FIR stating
that he accidently got hit..

628
01:56:17,032 --> 01:56:17,766
..on the head and died.

629
01:56:23,232 --> 01:56:24,232
l'll handle this.

630
02:00:51,432 --> 02:00:52,432
Lazar!

631
02:01:08,499 --> 02:01:10,300
Annamma..

632
02:01:32,165 --> 02:01:33,165
Give it to me.

633
02:01:59,666 --> 02:02:02,068
lvan..he'll kill me.

634
02:02:43,699 --> 02:02:45,400
What is that sound?

635
02:02:48,666 --> 02:02:50,234
Someone has caught a pig in a trap.

636
02:02:50,766 --> 02:02:52,400
lt'll keep screaming till its death.

637
02:03:00,799 --> 02:03:03,001
What are you doing among these pigs?

638
02:03:13,099 --> 02:03:15,067
Kunia, come.

639
02:04:13,165 --> 02:04:15,033
l couldn't sleep properly.

640
02:04:15,599 --> 02:04:17,734
May be because l am not
familiar with this place.

641
02:04:18,699 --> 02:04:20,400
Once you are old..it is like that.

642
02:04:28,265 --> 02:04:32,068
Aloshy, you must give me a word.

643
02:04:34,265 --> 02:04:36,200
There shouldn't be a day, where..

644
02:04:36,599 --> 02:04:38,000
..you and Ivan face each other.

645
02:04:39,065 --> 02:04:42,568
l don't want one more son,
who kills his own sibling.

646
02:04:46,165 --> 02:04:47,666
l have something to tell Martha.

647
02:04:49,766 --> 02:04:54,070
When Haryson sir was in his death
bed, l went to Cochin and met him.

648
02:05:05,065 --> 02:05:09,035
Sir died a_er writing
his will in Kazhali's name.

649
02:05:09,432 --> 02:05:13,302
l have always hidden it.
Nothing is mine.

650
02:05:14,766 --> 02:05:16,000
Eveything belongs to you.

651
02:05:16,432 --> 02:05:17,499
l don't want that assets.

652
02:05:21,265 --> 02:05:22,399
Father, we know..

653
02:05:25,499 --> 02:05:26,566
..that this is not our place.

654
02:05:29,532 --> 02:05:30,666
Aloshy..

655
02:05:32,366 --> 02:05:36,236
..the good thing about you
is that i didn't bring you up.

656
02:05:37,666 --> 02:05:39,234
You are alwaysAnnamma's son.

657
02:05:56,199 --> 02:06:00,169
To my knowledge Haryson sir wrote
all his properties in Kazhali's name.

658
02:06:00,733 --> 02:06:04,403
Which will now belong to Martha.

659
02:06:04,733 --> 02:06:07,068
The documents are in lyob's bag.

660
02:06:08,332 --> 02:06:10,333
He'll give that to Aloshy.

661
02:06:12,299 --> 02:06:13,166
lvan..

662
02:06:15,466 --> 02:06:17,768
..some things should never unite.

663
02:06:19,199 --> 02:06:21,601
Ghee and honey. Both are good.

664
02:06:22,566 --> 02:06:26,336
But if both are eaten together,
a person will die.

665
02:06:28,165 --> 02:06:32,736
Your father and Aloshy are like that.

666
02:06:33,599 --> 02:06:34,266
Poison.

667
02:06:35,466 --> 02:06:39,002
Those who had to
unite got united. We are out.

668
02:06:39,799 --> 02:06:43,469
Now what is the use of
hanging on to the new documents?

669
02:06:44,599 --> 02:06:47,168
Else he should have died earlier.

670
02:06:47,332 --> 02:06:50,768
Yes. Now you want me
to kill my father also?

671
02:06:53,432 --> 02:06:55,233
Forthat matter,
who have you killed before?

672
02:06:56,132 --> 02:07:00,236
No wonder my brother kept
beating you now and then. Bitch!

673
02:07:02,099 --> 02:07:04,734
From now onwards the game
will be bemeen us, father and sons.

674
02:07:05,299 --> 02:07:08,168
lf l am the one who started this,
then l know how to end it also.

675
02:07:10,566 --> 02:07:11,667
Come on.

676
02:07:27,132 --> 02:07:28,466
lf lyob had not been there..

677
02:07:30,566 --> 02:07:34,236
..all these would have belonged
to Thacho and his daughter.

678
02:07:37,766 --> 02:07:39,667
Haryson sir..

679
02:07:39,766 --> 02:07:43,736
..believed in the British principle
of removing a thorn with a thorn.

680
02:07:44,299 --> 02:07:46,401
He asked lyob to look
a_er Thacho's family.

681
02:07:46,599 --> 02:07:51,503
lyob also believed in the
natural priniciple that the sin..

682
02:07:51,733 --> 02:07:53,401
..of killing will disappear,
once you consume it.

683
02:07:53,532 --> 02:07:58,103
ln future, when it was clear
that Dimitri will not get a girl..

684
02:07:58,232 --> 02:08:00,500
..from surrounding locality,
Iyob got him married to Rahel.

685
02:08:00,566 --> 02:08:05,671
ln another perspective, Rahel was a
Iand mine le_ behind by Haryson.

686
02:08:21,733 --> 02:08:28,239
lncluding Ivan, anyone who
Ieft this house shouldn't return.

687
02:08:29,499 --> 02:08:30,633
lfthey don't return

688
02:08:32,532 --> 02:08:34,634
..this house, land and..

689
02:08:36,265 --> 02:08:37,299
..then me..

690
02:08:38,799 --> 02:08:40,233
..will be all yours.

691
02:08:57,699 --> 02:08:59,400
Don't you like Munnar's climate?

692
02:09:17,599 --> 02:09:18,599
Hello!

693
02:09:21,099 --> 02:09:24,168
Ravuther had a clear cut plan.

694
02:09:24,733 --> 02:09:26,734
And lyer to implement it.

695
02:09:41,766 --> 02:09:44,034
l would even spare
one who smuggles ganja..

696
02:09:44,332 --> 02:09:48,569
..but a_ertaking salay from British,
how dare you protest against them?

697
02:09:49,199 --> 02:09:50,366
You rascal!

698
02:09:50,599 --> 02:09:51,433
Hey!

699
02:09:54,165 --> 02:09:55,065
What is this?

700
02:09:55,632 --> 02:09:56,733
What is this?

701
02:10:00,699 --> 02:10:04,069
Sir, your son is vey bad.

702
02:11:27,799 --> 02:11:29,267
Thieves!

703
02:11:36,265 --> 02:11:37,366
lyer sir.

704
02:11:40,566 --> 02:11:43,101
Will the legal force do its duty..

705
02:11:44,566 --> 02:11:47,201
..or do you want our help?

706
02:11:48,766 --> 02:11:52,569
lt is completely my pleasure, sir.
You cary on with your work.

707
02:13:07,065 --> 02:13:09,734
lyob's forest instinct
knew that hunter will follow..

708
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:12,769
..after the hunting dogs.

709
02:13:18,466 --> 02:13:19,700
lt is dangerous to stay here.

710
02:13:21,399 --> 02:13:23,667
Next they'll come in
search of me and Martha.

711
02:13:26,699 --> 02:13:28,100
We'll ascend the forest.

712
02:13:29,099 --> 02:13:30,233
You inform Aloshy when he comes.

713
02:13:49,099 --> 02:13:50,066
Kunia!

714
02:13:54,666 --> 02:13:55,500
Kunia!

715
02:14:29,766 --> 02:14:30,700
There is no one here.

716
02:14:30,766 --> 02:14:31,600
l know.

717
02:14:32,632 --> 02:14:34,033
Where did Martha go?

718
02:14:35,232 --> 02:14:36,199
l don't know.

719
02:14:36,366 --> 02:14:37,767
Don't you know?

720
02:14:39,132 --> 02:14:40,600
lf she is not here, there is no doubt.

721
02:14:41,065 --> 02:14:43,567
Boss must have ascended the forest.
l'm sure about it.

722
02:14:48,399 --> 02:14:49,566
What are you staring at?

723
02:14:50,399 --> 02:14:51,433
Loweryour eyes.

724
02:14:53,632 --> 02:14:55,266
Lower your eyes, bitch.

725
02:14:55,366 --> 02:14:57,000
lvan, let us leave.

726
02:14:58,232 --> 02:14:59,600
Loweryour eyes.

727
02:15:24,332 --> 02:15:26,000
Son ! - Come on.

728
02:15:35,366 --> 02:15:40,404
During that period, even grass
in Munnar had the sharpness of a sword.

729
02:16:54,766 --> 02:16:56,200
Load!

730
02:17:47,632 --> 02:17:49,633
lf someone enquires
about your finger..

731
02:17:49,766 --> 02:17:51,601
..say that you shook
hands with Aloshy in Munnar

732
02:18:21,566 --> 02:18:22,566
Fresh.

733
02:18:23,199 --> 02:18:24,133
lt is still hot.

734
02:18:43,265 --> 02:18:47,168
Niamu, neither the
ones who ran away..

735
02:18:48,532 --> 02:18:49,266
..northe ones..

736
02:18:51,132 --> 02:18:52,399
..who went in search of them Shouldn't
come out of this forest alive.

737
02:19:37,566 --> 02:19:38,533
Cheeru!

738
02:19:45,466 --> 02:19:49,436
All that followed a_erwards was
our Munnar's own urban legend..

739
02:21:41,466 --> 02:21:44,101
You go. Go. Listen to what l say. Go.

740
02:22:53,799 --> 02:22:57,335
Aloshy, Go save Martha!

741
02:23:06,132 --> 02:23:08,567
Aloshy, this is foryour child.

742
02:23:10,099 --> 02:23:12,000
You are going to be a father.

743
02:23:13,332 --> 02:23:15,033
Don't be a father like me.

744
02:23:18,165 --> 02:23:19,766
Today you must listen to what l say.

745
02:23:21,366 --> 02:23:24,135
Go..go.

746
02:23:26,799 --> 02:23:27,766
Go..

747
02:24:18,032 --> 02:24:20,534
How are you, sir? Are you fine?

748
02:24:21,432 --> 02:24:25,269
l came to Munnarjust
to chop a few trees.

749
02:24:27,499 --> 02:24:28,633
What did you say then?

750
02:24:30,399 --> 02:24:33,001
No need. You need not cut trees.

751
02:24:36,232 --> 02:24:39,501
Now your house, hills and your
daughter-in-law Rahel are all mine.

752
02:24:40,632 --> 02:24:45,069
Your sons Ivan and ..

753
02:24:45,199 --> 02:24:47,401
Aloshy. - Yes, Aloshy.

754
02:24:48,766 --> 02:24:51,168
Both will fight and kill each other.

755
02:24:52,432 --> 02:24:54,734
My calculations never go wrong, sir.

756
02:24:55,132 --> 02:24:56,233
You are wrong, Ravuther.

757
02:24:57,132 --> 02:24:58,333
ln the case ofAloshy..

758
02:24:58,799 --> 02:25:01,434
..being his father even
my calculation went wrong.

759
02:25:02,099 --> 02:25:03,066
Then yours is nothing.

760
02:25:05,566 --> 02:25:09,069
His name is Aloshy. My third son.

761
02:25:13,265 --> 02:25:14,466
My sincere deathday wishes
for you to rest in peace.

762
02:27:06,399 --> 02:27:07,333
Aloshy..

763
02:27:08,432 --> 02:27:12,135
..just now your father
spoke so high about you.

764
02:27:12,766 --> 02:27:15,969
He has so much love foryou.

765
02:27:22,065 --> 02:27:22,765
lvan..

766
02:27:25,299 --> 02:27:26,199
..this is for you.

767
02:31:25,399 --> 02:31:27,367
A_er Ravuther's death..

768
02:31:27,799 --> 02:31:31,169
..Rahel wasn't interested in
serving anyone or cooking for anyone..

769
02:31:31,599 --> 02:31:33,767
.. and thereby declared
her own independence.

770
02:32:12,432 --> 02:32:18,538
Memories are like an old black and
white unimportant lifeless obituay.

771
02:32:19,165 --> 02:32:22,301
But even now l think aboutAloshy.

772
02:32:23,733 --> 02:32:28,737
ln 1957, for the first
time in this world a democratic..

773
02:32:29,065 --> 02:32:32,234
..elected communist government was formed
in Kerala.

774
02:32:32,399 --> 02:32:37,103
Rosamma Punnose contested for assembly
election from Devikulam and won.

775
02:32:37,632 --> 02:32:39,633
P.T. Punnose got elected
to the parliament.

776
02:32:40,499 --> 02:32:42,067
lt was the victoy ofthose..

777
02:32:42,165 --> 02:32:44,133
..who didn't di_erentiate
bemeen life and politics.

778
02:33:00,532 --> 02:33:04,736
Afterthat l have never
seen Aloshy and Martha.

779
02:33:06,265 --> 02:33:10,602
People like Aloshy who have
seen and travelled the world..

780
02:33:11,265 --> 02:33:16,503
..one who is tolerant will
change this county one day.

781
02:33:17,065 --> 02:33:21,269
That day life will be
more youthful and loveable.

782
02:33:41,599 --> 02:33:45,069
The End
