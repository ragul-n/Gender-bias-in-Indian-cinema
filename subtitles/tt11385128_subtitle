74
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,542
He has always hated me, 
even before my promotion.

75
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:44,250
More so after I received this medal.

76
00:06:45,292 --> 00:06:47,292
He'll keep taking a dig at me.

77
00:06:47,542 --> 00:06:48,792
Bad enough he hates me.

78
00:06:49,292 --> 00:06:50,292
To make things worse,

79
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:52,208
because I'm fond of you, 
he just can't stand the sight of you.

80
00:06:53,167 --> 00:06:54,958
He's a good officer, no doubt.

81
00:06:55,167 --> 00:06:56,958
To catch a scumbag, 
he must become one.

82
00:06:57,042 --> 00:06:59,083
That's how he thinks.

83
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,583
So he became the biggest scumbag 
of all time.

84
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:05,375
Mr. Sathya, we were talking about you 
in a bad way.

85
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:07,625
-Badmouthing me? 
-I'm just kidding.

86
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:08,750
You are a smart aleck, sir!

87
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:11,000
With your blessings 
he has won the State Award.

88
00:07:11,417 --> 00:07:12,667
Next, he will head for the Task Force.

89
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:14,833
Then you'll ensure he gets 
the Central Gallantry Award.

90
00:07:15,167 --> 00:07:17,375
My blessings will fetch nothing but gas!

But with support 
from someone like you,

93
00:07:20,583 --> 00:07:23,500
instead of focusing on 
being clean shaven,

94
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,083
I can shape my career too.

95
00:07:25,292 --> 00:07:26,125

96
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:28,292
Only fools follow rules blindly, sir.

97
00:07:29,042 --> 00:07:32,250
Just to change our department's outlook 
now and then,

98
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:34,125
people like me like to break the rules.

99
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:36,167
Given a chance, 
even we can break the rules.

We'll join our age group.

109
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:07,667
Thank you.

110
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:11,167
What do you do?

111
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:14,458
I'm planning to start something with you.

112
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:17,042
Excuse me?

113
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:21,458
Two years ago, 
I completed my Masters in Psychology.

114
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,208
Writing is my passion.

115
00:08:23,417 --> 00:08:25,292
My wish is to write a crime novel.

116
00:08:25,792 --> 00:08:27,250
With a hero like you.

117
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:29,417
Why a hero "like" me?

118
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:31,375
I can very well be your hero!

119
00:08:36,417 --> 00:08:37,250
Really?

120
00:08:37,792 --> 00:08:39,292
Don't you have a problem?

121
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,583
Without moving a muscle 
if someone fancies me as a hero,

122
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:44,708
why should I have a problem?

123
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:46,875
And that too someone like you...

124
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:50,250
Like me?

125
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:52,417

126
00:08:58,917 --> 00:09:01,792
I don't know whether this drink 
is making me delusional

127
00:09:01,917 --> 00:09:02,833
or you are really beautiful.

128
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:04,083
But...

129
00:09:05,417 --> 00:09:06,292
you're hot!

00:09:08,292 --> 00:09:09,208

131
00:09:10,667 --> 00:09:11,667
Thank you.

132
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:14,417
You aren't drunk.

133
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,042
I have a mirror at my house.

134

135
00:09:20,542 --> 00:09:21,667
I know, I mean...

136
00:09:21,917 --> 00:09:22,958
I'm sure...

137
00:09:24,458 --> 00:09:27,333
But why does a beautiful 
and erudite girl like you

138
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:31,042
have this fascination 
for crime novels and grisly murders?

139
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:32,167
Why not?

140
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:35,167
Do you think girls 
are only about pink pillows,

141
00:09:35,417 --> 00:09:37,417
teddy bears and love symbols?

142
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:39,292
I am...

143
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,375
not the type to ask my man, 
"When will you marry me, dear?"

144
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,542
"When do you want me to kill you?" 
Are you that type?

145
00:09:46,792 --> 00:09:47,833
Exactly!

146
00:09:49,167 --> 00:09:52,292
Somehow, I can't eat 
unless I see blood once a day.

147
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:57,708
You are a psycho! You know that?

148
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,417
I got it.

149
00:10:03,042 --> 00:10:03,917

00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:05,750
My novel's opening line.

151
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:08,667
My heroine is Ananya.

152
00:10:08,792 --> 00:10:11,000
Hero, DCP Akshay, tells her,

153
00:10:11,417 --> 00:10:13,083
"You are a psycho, you know that?"

154
00:10:13,917 --> 00:10:15,375
After that they both dance.

155
00:10:15,667 --> 00:10:17,167
-Then that girl... 
-Shall we?

156
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:20,417
-What? 
-Dance!

157
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:26,458
Don't worry, think this as a part 
of your research.

00:12:34,292 --> 00:12:37,417
"Entwine me, my darling"

182
00:12:37,667 --> 00:12:41,792
"In a dizzy daze as we dance 
Overwhelming me with your glance"

183
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:43,333
"Come on, come on, come on, come on"

184
00:12:43,417 --> 00:12:44,542
"Closer now"

185
00:12:46,417 --> 00:12:50,208
"Wanna touch you, touch you 
Now, now, now, now, now"

186
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:54,083
"Baby, kiss me, kiss me 
Now, now, now, now, now"

187
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:57,917
"Wanna touch you, touch you 
Now, now, now, now, now"

188
00:12:58,042 --> 00:13:01,458
"Baby, kiss me, kiss me now"

189
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:05,208
"Wanna touch you, touch you 
Now, now, now, now, now"

190
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:09,542
"Baby, kiss me, kiss me 
Now, now, now, now, now"

191
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:13,042
"Wanna touch you, touch you 
Now, now, now, now, now"

192
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:16,167
"Baby, kiss me, kiss me now"

193
00:13:28,042 --> 00:13:29,292
-Bye. 
-Bye.

194
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:30,250
See you.

195
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:31,708
See you too.

196
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:03,667
Hey, do you want to come in? 
Kasturi is not at home.

197
00:14:03,917 --> 00:14:05,958
-No, you just leave! 
-Bye.

198
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:11,708
[whistling]

199
00:14:57,625 --> 00:14:58,458
[whistles]

200
00:15:36,417 --> 00:15:37,333
Adi?

201
00:15:39,042 --> 00:15:40,125
Adi!

202
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:44,417
Adi!

203
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:48,542
Kirthu, what?

204
00:15:48,792 --> 00:15:52,375
Your phone is ringing non-stop. 
I think it's Mansoor.

205
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:54,917
-What's the time? 
-5:30 a.m.

206
00:16:02,042 --> 00:16:02,875
Tell me, Mansoor.

207
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,625
Do you remember Inspector Prasad, sir?

208
00:16:04,792 --> 00:16:05,792
He is murdered, sir.

209
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:07,208
In his own house.

210
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:13,250
[overlapping voices]

211
00:16:13,417 --> 00:16:15,250
-Sir! 
-Hey, Mansoor.

212
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:17,750
Entire Hyderabad police force 
seems to be here.

213
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:21,125
DCP Sathya and ACP Raghava 
of Crime Branch are also inside.

214
00:16:21,542 --> 00:16:23,375
But I feel you should take a look at this.

215
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:28,125
[reporters clamoring]

216
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:29,458
Hello, sir.

217
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:30,792
You finally showed up.

218
00:16:30,917 --> 00:16:33,583
You had a blast last night, right? 
Go in and see for yourself,

219
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:36,083
you'll soon be sober! Go inside.

220
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:07,083
DCP Adithya! I want you!

221
00:17:07,542 --> 00:17:10,375
[sighs rhythmically]

222
00:17:13,042 --> 00:17:15,542
Though the knife used is small, 
it is rather sharp.

223
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:19,375
He has cut the brachial 
and femoral arteries.

224
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:21,333
And slowly slit the victim's neck.

225
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:26,042
Basically, he has drained 
all the blood from the body.

226
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:30,708
He knew what has to be done 
to ensure the victim dies at once.

227
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:32,625
Unsub knew how long it will take.

228
00:17:33,167 --> 00:17:35,250
And he knew the right time too.

229
00:17:36,708 --> 00:17:38,917
A perfectly planned murder.

230
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:40,417
Mr. Task Force.

231
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:44,000
The investigation is not your job. 
It is ours.

232
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:48,750
After that sensational love note 
left for me, I have to respond, sir.

233
00:17:51,167 --> 00:17:52,042
Any witness?

234
00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:54,667
Half an hour ago, 
his wife unexpectedly found him like this.

235
00:17:54,917 --> 00:17:56,250
No other witness.

236
00:17:56,792 --> 00:17:58,625
Clues team will be here in five minutes.

237
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:00,167
We have circled the house.

238
00:18:00,292 --> 00:18:02,667
As of now, we have found some shoe marks.

239
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:04,875
The entire area has been blocked.

240
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:06,583
We are even combing the area.

241
00:18:08,083 --> 00:18:09,042
-Mansoor?-Sir?

242
00:18:09,167 --> 00:18:11,792
-Was Prasad at our party last night? 
-No, sir.

243
00:18:12,042 --> 00:18:14,750
If Prasad's wife goes out of town, 
he gets free incoming and outgoing.

244
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,250
Common talk, sir.

245
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:18,125
[weeping]

246
00:18:20,167 --> 00:18:24,500
Meanwhile, Mr. Sathya is investigating 
if Mrs. Prasad is having any fling.

247
00:18:25,042 --> 00:18:26,333
-Children? 
-None, sir.

248
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:29,875
Though Prasad had accounts 
all over the place, no deposits, sir.

249
00:18:30,167 --> 00:18:31,000
Zero balance.

250
00:18:31,167 --> 00:18:32,458
-Banking issues. 
-[chuckles]

251
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:35,833
What?

252
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:37,792
Nothing, sir.

253
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:41,500
Incense fume is good for health, sir, 
but won't agree with you. Come.

254
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:42,458
[cameras click] 
Good morning.

255
00:18:42,917 --> 00:18:46,417
The murder of Inspector Vedaprasad

256
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:48,125
is taken very seriously by our department.

257
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:53,292
Challenging our department 
and DCP Adithya is not right.

258
00:18:54,167 --> 00:18:59,417
So this case will be rightfully handled 
by Task Force DCP Adithya.

259
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:01,292
Shankar?

260
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:02,625
-Mr. Adithya. 
-Yeah.

261
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:05,458
I believe the killer has left a note 
for you on Prasad's body?

262
00:19:05,542 --> 00:19:06,375
[chuckles]

263
00:19:07,042 --> 00:19:08,125
Yeah.

264
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:12,000
Specifically, to give the media 
some cud to chew!

265
00:19:12,708 --> 00:19:16,417
Psychos opt for this modus operandi 
generally to be in the limelight.

266
00:19:19,292 --> 00:19:22,875
I want to tell this murderer 
something specific.

267
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:29,417
He has committed two grave blunders.

268
00:19:34,042 --> 00:19:35,042
First mistake,

269
00:19:36,167 --> 00:19:38,958
of course, committing this murder.

270
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:41,542
Second mistake,

271
00:19:43,042 --> 00:19:44,292
to challenge me.

272
00:19:45,792 --> 00:19:49,083
Very soon he'll be punished  
 for both his blunders.

273
00:19:52,167 --> 00:19:54,000
That's all and thank you.

274
00:19:57,125 --> 00:20:00,667
Good morning, sir, I spoke to Dr. Rajesh 
and Shekar from the forensic department.

275
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:04,208
You are bang on about both 
the post-mortem and forensic reports.

276
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:06,167
Sir.

277
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:11,167
We are contacting all numbers 
on Prasad's call log.

278
00:20:11,417 --> 00:20:13,292
Wondering if you know this number?

279
00:20:20,417 --> 00:20:22,083
I saw her in the party last night...

280
00:20:22,167 --> 00:20:23,708
-That's exactly what I wanted to say.  
 -Shh!

281
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,500
[doorbell rings]

282
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:41,875
-Hi. 
-Hi.

283
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:48,917
Looks like you're in the midst 
of a murder. Shall I come back later?

284
00:20:50,292 --> 00:20:52,042
Oh! No, no, no. Please come.

285
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,625
Mom.

286
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:58,208
Mom.

287
00:21:03,833 --> 00:21:05,208
He is Mr. Adithya, DCP.

288
00:21:05,292 --> 00:21:06,250
Task Force.

289
00:21:06,417 --> 00:21:09,833
[snipping]

290
00:21:10,375 --> 00:21:12,167
Oh! Your hero?

291
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:13,333
Mom, be quiet.

292
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:16,042
I meant your novel's hero?

293
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:18,000
Please don't embarrass me.

294
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:19,708
This is my mom, Sreelatha.

295
00:21:19,792 --> 00:21:21,333
She's a Biology Professor.

296
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:23,625
-Greetings, aunty. 
-Hi.

297
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:27,750
-Dad, this is... 
-I heard you.

298
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:29,417
-Dad is also... [screams] 
-[snips]

299
00:21:30,208 --> 00:21:31,500
I'm sorry.

300
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:33,833
I'm so happy to meet you.

301
00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:36,333
I am also excited 
to meet your family.

302
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:38,000
Please sit.

303
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:40,083
-Coffee? 
-Yeah, sure. Please.

304
00:21:40,167 --> 00:21:42,042
I'll go outside and chop all the heads...

305
00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:43,542
He means the plants.

306
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:45,750
Our garden is filled with unwanted plants.

307
00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:47,500
Dad, please carry on. Yeah.

308
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:49,125
I am sorry.

309
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:52,458
Okay.

310
00:21:52,625 --> 00:21:54,083
My dad is a Tamilian.

311
00:21:54,208 --> 00:21:56,250
He hasn't got a good grip of Telugu yet.

312
00:21:56,708 --> 00:21:57,583
Yeah!

313
00:21:57,708 --> 00:21:59,958
Looks like he has enough grip 
to chop only heads!

314
00:22:01,458 --> 00:22:02,458
That doll and knife...

315
00:22:03,958 --> 00:22:06,292
Oh! That doll and knife...

316
00:22:06,375 --> 00:22:07,417
I wanted to re-stuff it.

317
00:22:10,458 --> 00:22:12,542
With all those weapons, 
I thought you were a psycho family.

318
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:14,792
Thanks to our psycho genes, 
we are your fans!

319
00:22:17,458 --> 00:22:18,875
By the way,

320
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,833
I got to know from the news 
you have criminal fans too.

321
00:22:23,042 --> 00:22:27,500
Someone killed Inspector Prasad 
and is targeting you it seems.

322
00:22:28,625 --> 00:22:30,417
Don't know the gender as yet!

323
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:32,625
Yet to figure it out.

324
00:22:33,917 --> 00:22:35,042
Which means?

325
00:22:35,458 --> 00:22:36,417
[chuckles]

326
00:22:37,417 --> 00:22:38,667
Nothing specific.

327
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:39,792
Do I get a tour of your house?

328
00:22:41,292 --> 00:22:42,750
Sure, yeah.

329
00:22:42,833 --> 00:22:45,333
Actually, downstairs is boring. 
Come up to my room.

330
00:22:46,708 --> 00:22:47,875
This is my room.

331
00:23:02,042 --> 00:23:03,292
-Appu! 
-Yes, mom.

332
00:23:03,958 --> 00:23:04,875
Coffee.

333
00:23:05,417 --> 00:23:06,375
Coffee.

334
00:23:35,208 --> 00:23:36,750
Kill!

335
00:23:56,792 --> 00:23:57,875
Bad manners!

336
00:23:58,375 --> 00:24:00,875
Isn't it bad manners 
to rummage through others' stuff?

337
00:24:01,083 --> 00:24:02,667
Just curious, that's all.

338
00:24:02,917 --> 00:24:03,750
-Coffee. 
-Thank you.

339
00:24:03,833 --> 00:24:04,833
Please sit.

340
00:24:04,917 --> 00:24:05,750
You sit.

341
00:24:13,458 --> 00:24:14,542
What's all this stuff?

342
00:24:16,042 --> 00:24:17,000
Research.

343
00:24:17,375 --> 00:24:19,708
Didn't I tell you that 
I am writing a crime novel?

344
00:24:21,083 --> 00:24:22,583
Different kinds of murders,

345
00:24:22,667 --> 00:24:23,792
psycho mentalities.

346
00:24:23,875 --> 00:24:24,833
Was Prasad a psycho?

347
00:24:29,958 --> 00:24:30,958
Huh?

348
00:24:32,167 --> 00:24:33,500
Inspector Prasad.

349
00:24:33,875 --> 00:24:35,833
How do you know Prasad 
who died last night?

350
00:24:38,458 --> 00:24:40,042
Your number was on Prasad's call log.

351
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:42,083
Oh!

352
00:24:44,333 --> 00:24:46,667
Does that mean I'm your suspect?

353
00:24:48,875 --> 00:24:49,833
How exciting!

354
00:24:50,583 --> 00:24:52,750
Apoorva, come on, be serious. 
This is serious, okay?

355
00:24:55,083 --> 00:24:56,750
I wanted to meet you.

356
00:24:57,167 --> 00:24:59,583
A friend of mine gave me Prasad's number 
and asked me to contact him.

357
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:01,000
So I met Prasad

358
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:03,250
two weeks ago. Very interesting guy!

359
00:25:04,583 --> 00:25:06,125
He invited me to your medal party.

360
00:25:06,583 --> 00:25:07,542
That's how I met you.

361
00:25:07,625 --> 00:25:10,708
[mobile ringing]

362
00:25:12,208 --> 00:25:13,958
-Hello.-Hi, Adithya.

363
00:25:14,625 --> 00:25:15,625
Yeah, who is this?

364
00:25:15,917 --> 00:25:17,125
Have you already forgotten me?

365
00:25:20,083 --> 00:25:21,333
I gave you a gift this morning.

366
00:25:23,667 --> 00:25:24,958
I watched your press meet too.

367
00:25:25,042 --> 00:25:27,125
You claimed I had made some mistakes.

368
00:25:27,208 --> 00:25:28,708
First was killing Prasad.

369
00:25:28,792 --> 00:25:30,125
Second,

370
00:25:30,333 --> 00:25:31,833
-provoking you.  
-[keypad clicking]

371
00:25:31,917 --> 00:25:33,167
It seemed so cinematic!

372
00:25:33,542 --> 00:25:34,458
[mobile chimes]

373
00:25:34,542 --> 00:25:35,375
Tell me, tell me!

374
00:25:35,458 --> 00:25:38,083
-I don't know, sir. 
-Ravi, track sir's phone. It's urgent.

375
00:25:38,375 --> 00:25:39,208
Get lost!

376
00:25:39,833 --> 00:25:41,375
Will you really nab me?

377
00:25:41,583 --> 00:25:43,500
-Any doubts?-You bet!

378
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:46,167
If the cop I challenged  
 is chatting with his girlfriend,

379
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:47,125
how can I be sure?

380
00:25:48,708 --> 00:25:50,333
Your girlfriend looks beautiful.

381
00:25:50,708 --> 00:25:52,417
I saw her at the party last night.

382
00:25:52,625 --> 00:25:53,875
-Adithya!-You are made for each other.

383
00:25:54,417 --> 00:25:55,708
What happened? Slow down. Slow down.

384
00:25:55,792 --> 00:25:56,917
-What happened? 
-I don't know

385
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:01,000
Dad, give him way.

386
00:26:05,875 --> 00:26:07,292
Looking for me all over the place?

387
00:26:07,375 --> 00:26:09,667
I am not there now.  
 I saw you going into her house.

388
00:26:09,833 --> 00:26:12,500
By the way,  
 you have another victim in Murgi Chowk.

389
00:26:12,583 --> 00:26:13,750
Come and collect his body.

390
00:26:13,958 --> 00:26:15,708
I will share the location. Bye.

391
00:26:19,042 --> 00:26:19,958
[mobile ringing]

392
00:26:20,792 --> 00:26:22,042
-Mansoor. 
-We have traced the call, sir.

393
00:26:22,125 --> 00:26:23,708
Starting now, right now.

394
00:26:24,167 --> 00:26:25,625
Hey, Adithya.

395
00:26:26,125 --> 00:26:27,958
Don't go out of town 
without letting me know.

396
00:26:28,042 --> 00:26:29,958
Shall I come with you? 
Part of my research?

397
00:26:30,042 --> 00:26:31,583
What? I'll see you again.

398
00:26:34,458 --> 00:26:35,458
Turn right.

399
00:26:38,292 --> 00:26:40,708
In 20 meters, turn right.

400
00:26:43,917 --> 00:26:45,125
Turn left.

401
00:26:47,167 --> 00:26:50,000
[market clamor]

402

[chickens clucking]

403
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,833
You have reached your destination.

404

[roller shutter thuds]

405
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:17,208
[goat bleating]

406
00:27:24,125 --> 00:27:25,542
What a weird location, sir!

407
00:27:28,583 --> 00:27:29,833
Sir, on your back...

408
00:27:41,833 --> 00:27:44,333
[mobile ringing]

409
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:46,625
-Hello. 
-Hello, hello, hello.

410
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:48,333
Mic testing, one, two, three.

411
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:49,917
One, two, three.

412
00:27:50,875 --> 00:27:53,208
I was just checking your speed.

413
00:27:53,292 --> 00:27:55,208
I was right behind you but you missed me.

414
00:27:56,667 --> 00:27:58,417
Don't try to trace me.

415
00:27:58,708 --> 00:28:00,333
All these are stolen phones.

416
00:28:00,917 --> 00:28:02,125
Before your men trace my number,

417
00:28:02,375 --> 00:28:04,583
and before this phone owner  
 blocks his sim card,

418
00:28:05,292 --> 00:28:08,125
let me gladly tell you about 
the third mistake I'm planning to commit.

419
00:28:10,417 --> 00:28:13,083
From today, I intend killing four people.

420
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:16,333
But including Inspector Prasad, 
it will be a round figure.

421
00:28:16,458 --> 00:28:17,333
Five!

422
00:28:18,625 --> 00:28:21,083
I'll be leaving a trail of clues for you, 
just for fun.

423
00:28:22,333 --> 00:28:25,375
If you can stop me 
from committing these murders,

424
00:28:26,208 --> 00:28:28,083
I swear I'll accept you are a super cop.

425
00:28:28,708 --> 00:28:29,875
At the same time,  
 if you are unable to stop me...

426
00:28:33,292 --> 00:28:34,583
you must convene a press meet

427
00:28:34,667 --> 00:28:38,917
and toss your gallantry medal 
along with your other two-bit awards

428
00:28:39,042 --> 00:28:41,208
into the dust bin in front of everyone.

429
00:28:41,458 --> 00:28:45,375
And accept that you are not a super cop 
or a six-pack cop,

430
00:28:45,625 --> 00:28:48,417
but just a pathetic, clueless cop.

431
00:28:49,583 --> 00:28:50,833
And then you must resign.

432
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:53,875
Do you want to play games with me?

433
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:55,583
Exactly!

434
00:28:55,917 --> 00:28:57,667
Whatever I do, 
it should be entertaining.

435
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:58,583
That's my policy!

436
00:28:59,042 --> 00:29:01,208
If I play with celebrities like you,

437
00:29:01,958 --> 00:29:03,292
it is a different sensation altogether.

438
00:29:03,708 --> 00:29:05,417
That's why I chose you.

439
00:29:06,292 --> 00:29:07,208
Okay, tell me.

440
00:29:07,458 --> 00:29:08,917
Deal or no deal?

441
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,375
When you are so enthusiastic 
why should I let you down?

442
00:29:13,167 --> 00:29:15,208
So let the fun begin.

443
00:29:18,417 --> 00:29:21,292
Mansoor, I want a total crackdown.

444
00:29:21,917 --> 00:29:23,292
I want this bastard.

445
00:29:33,208 --> 00:29:36,542

Do you think this is Pro Kabaddi?

449
00:29:48,667 --> 00:29:50,458
Speak up!

[screaming]

451
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:54,042
I don't know, sir.

452
00:29:57,292 --> 00:29:59,750
Hey, Saidhulu, I am missing you, dude.

453
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:06,125
Sir, for one year I have been working 
as an informer for Mr. Prasad.

454
00:30:06,542 --> 00:30:09,542
Mr. Prasad was slightly tense 
for the past six months.

455
00:30:09,875 --> 00:30:10,833
I don't know why, sir.

456
00:30:11,083 --> 00:30:15,333
Two weeks ago, 
Mr. Prasad met Mallikarjun in a bar.

457
00:30:15,542 --> 00:30:16,625
Who is Mallikarjun?

458
00:30:17,417 --> 00:30:18,958
The builder, sir. Real estate.

459
00:30:19,042 --> 00:30:21,333
-Chinni Krishna Constructions? 
-Yes, he's the one.

460
00:30:22,583 --> 00:30:23,500
Oh, this guy?

461
00:30:24,667 --> 00:30:26,542
I was sitting 
two tables away from them, sir.

462
00:30:26,792 --> 00:30:28,000
They didn't notice me.

463
00:30:29,125 --> 00:30:31,167
I was overhearing their conversation, sir.

464
00:30:32,167 --> 00:30:34,625
"You and I have to be careful, Mallik," 
Prasad sir cautioned him.

465
00:30:36,208 --> 00:30:37,917
Who were they afraid of? 
Did you hear any names?

466
00:30:39,542 --> 00:30:40,583
No, sir.

467
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:43,167
[sighs]

468
00:30:44,667 --> 00:30:45,750
I believe he has gone to Mumbai, sir.

469
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,375
He's returning tonight 
to inaugurate his new resort.

470
00:30:48,667 --> 00:30:50,083
He'll go directly to the resort.

471
00:30:52,458 --> 00:30:53,458
[train horn blowing]

472
00:30:58,417 --> 00:31:01,792
This isn't your film set at home 
to throw a temper tantrum!

473
00:31:01,875 --> 00:31:03,583
Warn him not to show off 
his insolence here.

474
00:31:03,833 --> 00:31:05,542
Otherwise, he will be headless!

475
00:31:06,542 --> 00:31:08,083
He thinks he can bump me off?

476
00:31:08,292 --> 00:31:11,292
I'll chop him into pieces and bury 
each part in different parts of the city.

477
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:13,708
Talk to you later.

478
00:31:14,042 --> 00:31:14,958
Bye.

479
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:18,042
Who is riling you up like this?

480
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:19,167
My brother, sir.

481
00:31:19,458 --> 00:31:22,583
My father bought land in Shamshabad 
before he died for my brother and me.

482
00:31:22,833 --> 00:31:24,667
My brother claims 
he is the sole owner now.

483
00:31:25,375 --> 00:31:26,833
He has seized my share 
and is threatening me!

484
00:31:27,417 --> 00:31:29,000
He has to be pickled to pieces.

485
00:31:29,083 --> 00:31:30,000
Shall I do the honors?

486
00:31:33,292 --> 00:31:34,625
Chopping him brow to toe.

487
00:31:34,667 --> 00:31:35,708
Shall I help you out?

488
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,458
I'm a professional!

489
00:31:43,958 --> 00:31:46,500
I'll slice him like a knife 
through a slab of butter.

490
00:31:47,625 --> 00:31:48,875
This is my routine.

491
00:31:49,458 --> 00:31:50,625
Specify your rate and identify him.

492
00:31:51,833 --> 00:31:53,667
To confirm after the deed is done,

493
00:31:54,708 --> 00:31:56,792
I can send you 
any part of his body, your choice!

494
00:32:01,333 --> 00:32:02,333
Sit down.

495
00:32:10,125 --> 00:32:13,250
Just a while ago you were dying 
to chop someone into pieces?

496
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:14,917
I said it casually, sir.

497
00:32:15,167 --> 00:32:17,417
-You'll kill people casually? 
-Just a common phrase, sir.

498
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:19,250
It's so common for you?

499
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:21,833
-Are you a professional too? 
-I just went with the flow.

500
00:32:22,083 --> 00:32:24,458
You kill people for no reason?

501
00:32:24,958 --> 00:32:26,375
-Are you a psycho? 
-Sir!

502
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,833
I'm an insurance agent, sir.

503
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,167
I'm a very normal person.

504
00:32:33,208 --> 00:32:34,917
-Am I not normal then? 
-I don't know, sir.

505
00:32:35,167 --> 00:32:36,208
-What do you mean? 
-You are...

506
00:32:36,458 --> 00:32:37,625
-I am what? 
-You are...

507
00:32:45,875 --> 00:32:46,750
Joke, sir.

508
00:32:56,917 --> 00:32:59,292
Look how violent all of us have become.

509
00:32:59,542 --> 00:33:01,250
-Sir? 
-Even though we talk about killing,

510
00:33:02,333 --> 00:33:04,917
but we would hate 
to even sit beside a real killer!

511
00:33:05,125 --> 00:33:06,542
-Don't you agree? 
-Yes, sir.

[ceremonial orchestra]

513
00:33:16,833 --> 00:33:18,625
-Greetings, sir. 
-Greetings.

514
00:33:18,917 --> 00:33:19,958
My flight got delayed.

515
00:33:20,792 --> 00:33:21,958
It is already 10 o'clock.

516
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:23,167
Have the guests arrived?

517
00:33:23,292 --> 00:33:24,417
-All okay? 
-All perfect, sir.

518
00:33:24,625 --> 00:33:26,750
Guests are coming in now. 
By 11 party will be in full swing.

519
00:33:26,958 --> 00:33:28,542
-If you can freshen up... 
-Okay.

520
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:31,333
-I'll be back in ten or 15 minutes. 
-Okay, sir.

521
00:33:31,417 --> 00:33:32,333
Somehow manage till then.

522
00:33:32,417 --> 00:33:33,250
Mr. Mallikarjun.

523
00:33:36,125 --> 00:33:37,500
-Please come. 
-I know. I know.

524
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:39,625
I'm not invited. I'm gatecrashing.

525
00:33:39,875 --> 00:33:41,958
-No, you are family. 
-Not bad.

526
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:46,250
I assumed you would be busy with the case 
and that's why I didn't invite you.

527
00:33:46,583 --> 00:33:47,583
I meant Prasad...

528
00:33:47,792 --> 00:33:49,125
I need to discuss it for a minute.

529
00:33:49,208 --> 00:33:50,083
Sure, absolutely.

530
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:52,167
Just got back from Mumbai.

531
00:33:52,333 --> 00:33:53,667
I'll freshen up and join you.

Okay.

00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:03,333
He looks fresh. Why refresh again?

536
00:34:03,417 --> 00:34:04,708
-Keep an eye on Mallik. 
-Done, sir.

537
00:34:04,792 --> 00:34:07,000
-Why is he here? 
-No idea, sir.

538
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:08,667
Okay, I'll take care of it.

539

-Will Nandini be coming tonight? 
-Yes, sir.

540
00:34:11,667 --> 00:34:13,042
Told her to come after midnight.

541
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:14,875
After the function you can relax and...

542
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:17,333
I've even arranged a special bed!

543
00:34:17,542 --> 00:34:19,083

-Hey.

544

What a surprise!

How come...you are here?

549
00:34:39,167 --> 00:34:42,708
You were the one who said I can't 
go anywhere without your permission.

550
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:46,375
Is that why you are stalking me?

551
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,750
Psycho, right? That's why.

552
00:34:51,958 --> 00:34:52,917
Did you come by yourself?

00:34:53,583 --> 00:34:55,000
Fat hopes!

554
00:34:56,458 --> 00:34:58,125
No, I came with my parents.

00:34:59,042 --> 00:35:00,375
He is my dad's friend.

556
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:02,292
He has bought a new villa here.

557
00:35:03,083 --> 00:35:04,417
He invited us over.

558
00:35:05,625 --> 00:35:06,542
What about you?

559
00:35:08,292 --> 00:35:10,708
This resort owner

562
00:35:15,583 --> 00:35:16,625
Isn't he a shady character?

563
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:18,583
Why?

564
00:35:19,583 --> 00:35:21,042
I don't know. Just thought so.

I have a hunch...

566
00:35:25,792 --> 00:35:27,750
something special may happen tonight.

Is this your idea?

Looks like you are an ardent fan 
of director K. Raghavendra Rao!

our daily grind with this kind of stuff.

605

How dare you imitate it so publicly 
in your private life?

606
00:38:08,625 --> 00:38:13,000
When he watches these visuals 
on TV tomorrow, how will he feel?

00:38:16,042 --> 00:38:18,458

he'll want to kill men like you?

in Raghavendra Rao's film be?

Yesterday, at the party,

689
00:43:32,708 --> 00:43:34,583
you said that, 
Mallikarjun is a shady fellow

690
00:43:34,833 --> 00:43:38,333
and that something special might happen.

691
00:43:39,250 --> 00:43:40,083
Why?

692
00:43:43,542 --> 00:43:46,917
I went to meet Prasad in a coffee shop 
regarding the research for my novel.

693
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:51,583
When I went there, Prasad was talking  
 to Mallik about somebody.

694
00:43:51,875 --> 00:43:53,750
That was the first time I saw Mallik.

695
00:43:54,875 --> 00:43:56,917
Later when I asked Prasad about it,

696
00:43:57,292 --> 00:44:01,750
he said some thug had threatened 
to kill Mallik and him.

697
00:44:02,042 --> 00:44:03,792
He said, "This is common."

698
00:44:04,042 --> 00:44:05,167
I asked him his name.

699
00:44:05,833 --> 00:44:06,875
He said, "Vicky."

700
00:44:11,875 --> 00:44:13,750
So when Prasad was murdered,

701
00:44:13,875 --> 00:44:16,542
somehow I felt 
Mallik may be the next target.

702
00:44:18,125 --> 00:44:21,125
But I never dreamt 
he would be killed so soon.

703
00:44:23,083 --> 00:44:24,292
Exactly!

704
00:44:26,250 --> 00:44:27,208
V for Vicky.

705
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:29,917

00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:32,458

on the victim's body for me

00:44:48,875 --> 00:44:50,042
-Mansoor?-Sir.

712
00:44:50,250 --> 00:44:53,000
Did Prasad or Mallikarjun 
know anyone by the name Vicky?

713
00:44:53,208 --> 00:44:55,583
-Find out if there was any bad blood.-Vicky, sir?

714
00:44:55,833 --> 00:44:57,875
-V could be Vicky.-Done, sir.

715
00:45:01,917 --> 00:45:02,750
So...

716
00:45:03,625 --> 00:45:07,125
If Vicky is found, will I get any reward 
or prize money?

717
00:45:07,208 --> 00:45:08,167
[scoffs]

718
00:45:09,167 --> 00:45:12,417
Even if Vicky is the murderer, 
he may not stop with these two murders.

719
00:45:13,708 --> 00:45:15,917
-Why? 
-Aren't you a psychology graduate?

720
00:45:16,417 --> 00:45:18,667
-Topper. 
-From today you're my consultant.

721
00:45:19,375 --> 00:45:20,292
Consultant?

722
00:45:20,708 --> 00:45:21,542
Yeah.

723
00:45:22,125 --> 00:45:24,292
My Criminal Psychology consultant?

724
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:30,042
Criminal Psychology consultant.

725
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:34,958
Does it mean I'm no longer a suspect?

726
00:45:37,042 --> 00:45:38,333
Of course you are a suspect.

727
00:45:45,125 --> 00:45:47,417
This offer is to observe you closely.

728
00:45:51,125 --> 00:45:51,958
Oh.

729
00:45:53,375 --> 00:45:54,875
What will be my salary?

730
00:45:56,958 --> 00:45:58,583
Based on your performance,

731
00:45:59,083 --> 00:46:00,083
I'll decide.

732
00:46:03,042 --> 00:46:05,208
How about perks, bonus, etc.?

733
00:46:05,958 --> 00:46:07,125
Only "he" can decide that!

734
00:46:07,708 --> 00:46:10,000
-Who is the "he"? 
-A bird that isn't a bird.

735
00:46:13,292 --> 00:46:14,583
Who is the "bird"?

736
00:46:18,542 --> 00:46:20,000
Clue left by the killer for me.

737
00:46:21,167 --> 00:46:22,167
Really?

738
00:46:23,833 --> 00:46:27,458
"A bird that isn't a bird. 
Cut its tail.

739
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,250
Look for the sun amidst the darkness."

740
00:46:30,625 --> 00:46:31,500
Weird!

741
00:46:32,375 --> 00:46:33,583
This guy...

742
00:46:34,833 --> 00:46:35,875
hates me.

743
00:46:37,292 --> 00:46:38,167
Actually...

744
00:46:41,083 --> 00:46:42,208
this is very common.

745
00:46:43,083 --> 00:46:46,958
These types of psychos get a kick 
challenging police officers like you.

746
00:46:47,708 --> 00:46:51,000
Plus, they get cheap thrills 
feeling they are one up on you.

747
00:46:52,917 --> 00:46:55,167
To know whether 
he is really a psycho or not,

748
00:46:56,542 --> 00:46:57,833
I need to crack this clue.

749
00:46:59,167 --> 00:47:01,750
So prove to me 
you're cleverer than the killer.

750
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,792
If you crack this clue in one day...

751
00:47:05,042 --> 00:47:05,958
If I do?

752
00:47:12,917 --> 00:47:13,792
[gasps]

753
00:47:22,083 --> 00:47:23,667
I'll even give you a bonus like this.

754
00:47:28,375 --> 00:47:30,292
With bonuses like this in advance,

755
00:47:30,625 --> 00:47:32,208
I'll work even more efficiently, sir.

756
00:47:32,417 --> 00:47:33,375
Adi?

757
00:47:34,917 --> 00:47:35,792
Adi?

758
00:47:36,333 --> 00:47:37,625
Coming, father-in-law!

759
00:47:39,167 --> 00:47:40,000
Hey...

760
00:47:41,917 --> 00:47:43,333
I'll give you 24 hours to crack it.

761
00:47:45,083 --> 00:47:46,208
This is my challenge.

762
00:47:48,083 --> 00:47:49,708
Again no fingerprints or footprints, sir.

763
00:47:49,792 --> 00:47:54,583
Texture of this cloth is like the napkin 
used for wrapping cutlery in hotels.

764
00:47:54,833 --> 00:47:57,208
Blood and saliva from the victim

765
00:47:57,458 --> 00:47:58,917
have smudged the lettering.

766
00:47:59,208 --> 00:48:00,667
I need time to decipher it.

767
00:48:00,917 --> 00:48:03,292
But if you observe closely, 
there is something faintly visible.

768
00:48:07,833 --> 00:48:10,375
Yeah, looks like some image.

769
00:48:12,958 --> 00:48:15,958
If this is a hotel napkin, 
then this could be their logo.

770
00:48:16,833 --> 00:48:18,542
If we trace that, we can nab the killer.

771
00:48:19,292 --> 00:48:20,417
Clean it up. What else?

772
00:48:20,667 --> 00:48:22,333
He is a high-end killer, sir.

773
00:48:22,458 --> 00:48:24,292
You are a high-end specialist! Nab him.

774
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:26,042
If you challenge him like this, 
he will finish in an hour.

775
00:48:26,125 --> 00:48:26,958
Sir?

776
00:48:27,042 --> 00:48:29,042
I need the report by tonight. 
Mansoor, be in touch.

777
00:48:29,250 --> 00:48:30,875
-Yes. 
-Impossible, sir.

778
00:48:31,167 --> 00:48:32,458
Is that so?

779
00:48:33,792 --> 00:48:34,667
Sir!

780
00:48:35,917 --> 00:48:36,750
Impossible, bro.

781
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,625
"Nothing is impossible. 
Just pay attention."

782
00:48:38,875 --> 00:48:41,042
Those are Sadhguru's words, not mine. 
Complete it by evening.

783
00:48:42,583 --> 00:48:44,583
He's a spiritual person, sir. 
He will deliver promptly.

784
00:48:44,833 --> 00:48:47,333
Sir, I checked Mallik's diary 
and found an entry made last week.

785
00:48:47,583 --> 00:48:50,292
Didn't you enquire about him? 
I mean, about Vicky?

786
00:48:51,583 --> 00:48:52,583
Shit, Vicky!

787
00:48:52,708 --> 00:48:54,458
I found Vicky's number 
in Mallik's call list.

788
00:48:54,708 --> 00:48:56,792
He called his wife from this number 
and we've traced it.

789
00:48:57,042 --> 00:48:58,708
He's in Sai Sri lodge in Mehdipatnam now.

790
00:48:58,875 --> 00:49:00,542
-Super, let's go. 
-Okay, sir.

791
00:49:15,458 --> 00:49:16,458
Laundry, sir.

792
00:49:21,333 --> 00:49:22,208
Laundry, sir.

793
00:49:27,917 --> 00:49:28,833
Call him again.

794
00:49:30,042 --> 00:49:30,958
Laundry, sir.

795
00:49:55,875 --> 00:49:57,167
-Sir? 
-Who are you?

796
00:49:57,417 --> 00:49:58,917
-Who are you to challenge me? 
-What did I do, sir?

797
00:49:59,208 --> 00:50:01,000
Sir, let go of me! What did I do, sir?

798
00:50:01,208 --> 00:50:02,417
I am innocent, sir.

799
00:50:02,667 --> 00:50:04,500
-I didn't do anything, sir. 
-Spill the beans, man.

800
00:50:04,583 --> 00:50:06,000
-Hey. 
-Sir, let go of me.

801
00:50:06,417 --> 00:50:07,667
I don't know anything, sir.

802
00:50:07,750 --> 00:50:08,583
It's not gonna happen.

803
00:50:08,958 --> 00:50:10,417
-What's happening? 
-Police raid, sir

804
00:50:11,250 --> 00:50:12,333
Some murderer it seems.

805
00:50:14,042 --> 00:50:15,083
Move it, man.

806
00:50:15,292 --> 00:50:16,208
Sir, listen to me.

807
00:50:16,458 --> 00:50:18,708
Sir, hear me out. 
Please listen to me.

808
00:50:33,667 --> 00:50:35,542
If a murderer is in the next room today,

809
00:50:37,917 --> 00:50:40,708
tomorrow he may very well be 
in our bed, right?

810
00:50:41,250 --> 00:50:42,625
Very true, sir.

811
00:50:43,125 --> 00:50:43,958
Check out.

812
00:50:46,625 --> 00:50:49,250
Sir, Prasad and Mallikarjun 
are hardcore thugs.

813
00:50:49,542 --> 00:50:51,292
Mallikarjun grabbed my land, sir.

814
00:50:51,833 --> 00:50:53,958
Prasad threatened 
to kill me if I sued him.

815
00:50:54,208 --> 00:50:56,917
That's when I decided to kill them.

816
00:50:57,083 --> 00:50:58,458
But I'm not so gutsy, sir.

817
00:50:58,708 --> 00:51:01,625
That's why I used to visit 
Kanakadurga bar daily.

818
00:51:01,750 --> 00:51:02,583
I swear on my mother.

819
00:51:02,708 --> 00:51:04,583
Trust me, sir. I didn't kill them.

820
00:51:06,208 --> 00:51:08,917
Did anyone at any time talk to you 
about Prasad or Mallikarjun?

821
00:51:09,833 --> 00:51:11,500
Why would anyone tell me, sir?

822
00:51:12,292 --> 00:51:15,167
Someone met me in that bar 
about a month ago, I remember now.

823
00:51:16,083 --> 00:51:18,000
Sat next to me 
and spoke for a long time, sir.

824
00:51:18,542 --> 00:51:20,750
Plagued me with questions 
about Prasad and Mallik.

825
00:51:20,917 --> 00:51:22,083
Can you describe him to me?

826
00:51:22,208 --> 00:51:24,167
I don't remember his face clearly.

827
00:51:24,417 --> 00:51:25,958
-What do you remember? 
-It was too dark, sir.

828
00:51:26,208 --> 00:51:28,750
-True, sir.-I was just checking your speed.

829
00:51:29,125 --> 00:51:31,125
I was right behind you and you missed me.

830
00:51:31,417 --> 00:51:33,167
Don't try to trace my call.

831
00:51:33,375 --> 00:51:34,792
All these are stolen phones.

832
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:35,833
This is his voice, sir.

833
00:51:35,917 --> 00:51:37,625
-By the time you trace this...  
-Almost the same voice, sir.

834
00:51:40,458 --> 00:51:43,708
We need one-month CCTV footage 
of the Kanakadurga bar.

835
00:51:43,792 --> 00:51:45,667
We need to see it. ASAP.

836
00:51:45,750 --> 00:51:47,083
[horn blaring]

837
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:56,542
[girl screaming over phone]

838
00:51:58,458 --> 00:51:59,917
[glass shattering over phone]

839
00:52:00,917 --> 00:52:02,167
[woman continues screaming]

840
00:52:08,792 --> 00:52:10,000
Favorite film, sir.

841
00:52:10,250 --> 00:52:11,500
The name of the film is "I Saw The Devil."

842
00:52:11,750 --> 00:52:14,542
A lady is chopped into bits and pieces.

843
00:52:14,625 --> 00:52:16,292
Wow! Superb movie, sir.

844
00:52:16,542 --> 00:52:18,958
I've watched it countless times. 
I find it amazing, sir.

845
00:52:19,875 --> 00:52:22,167
-You like violence in movies? 
-Yeah.

846
00:52:22,375 --> 00:52:25,208
I've always had a leaning 
towards violence from my childhood.

847
00:52:27,042 --> 00:52:27,917
Really?

848
00:52:28,625 --> 00:52:29,917
-Why? 
-Sir.

849
00:52:30,208 --> 00:52:32,958
All of us want to either beat up someone 
or kill someone once in a while.

850
00:52:33,208 --> 00:52:34,333
It isn't possible, right?

851
00:52:34,583 --> 00:52:36,250
You satisfy your killer instincts 
by watching such films.

852
00:52:36,958 --> 00:52:38,125
I am Balasubramaniam.

853
00:52:38,250 --> 00:52:39,458
Retired bank employee.

854
00:52:40,458 --> 00:52:42,542
I am Ramesh, contract killer.

855
00:52:42,750 --> 00:52:43,750
[laughs]

856
00:52:44,333 --> 00:52:45,250
Contract...

857
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:46,833
Killer!

858
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,500
-What do you mean? 
-Simple, sir,

859
00:52:49,042 --> 00:52:50,958
paid assassin.

860
00:52:51,292 --> 00:52:54,208
I am in great demand in Bombay. 
I visit the city ever so often.

861
00:53:01,875 --> 00:53:03,208
Exactly, the same way.

862
00:53:05,208 --> 00:53:07,292
If you move, I'll kill you.

863
00:53:07,542 --> 00:53:10,417
Sir, watching such films 
is a casual hobby of mine.

864
00:53:10,542 --> 00:53:13,542
It is all right to pass time watching, 
but is it wrong if I kill for a living?

865
00:53:13,625 --> 00:53:15,167
-Not like that. 
-No, right?

866
00:53:15,375 --> 00:53:16,667
There is nothing wrong 
in killing, right?

867
00:53:16,792 --> 00:53:17,625
-What do you mean? 
-What do you mean?

868
00:53:17,792 --> 00:53:18,667
I mean, it is your wish, sir.

869
00:53:18,750 --> 00:53:21,292
Is it okay if I stab you 
in your belly and gag you?

870
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:23,042
-Sir! 
-Is it okay?

871
00:53:23,208 --> 00:53:24,625
-No, sir. 
-You said it is my wish.

872
00:53:24,750 --> 00:53:26,292
I meant it is your call, sir.

873
00:53:29,708 --> 00:53:32,500
You are scared!

874
00:53:33,250 --> 00:53:34,333
Did I scare you?

875
00:53:34,542 --> 00:53:35,958
-Scared the hell out of you? 
-What?

876
00:53:36,125 --> 00:53:37,583
I was just joking, sir.

877
00:53:37,833 --> 00:53:39,375
-Joking? 
-Of course.

878
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,167
I am a killer.

879
00:53:41,250 --> 00:53:42,750
I am into a pesticide business.

880
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,667
I sell pesticides 
to kill cockroaches, termites, and rats.

881
00:53:45,958 --> 00:53:46,958
Do you want to see?

882
00:53:47,542 --> 00:53:48,625
No need.

883
00:53:50,292 --> 00:53:51,125
[sighs]

884
00:53:54,333 --> 00:53:56,083
You scared the hell out of me, sir

885
00:53:56,250 --> 00:54:00,083
[both laughing]

886
00:54:02,042 --> 00:54:04,125
You know there is a criminal 
lurking inside every one of us.

887
00:54:04,208 --> 00:54:06,000
For sure there's one in you. 
No doubt about that.

888
00:54:06,208 --> 00:54:08,792
Sir, can you believe 
a criminal resides in me too?

889
00:54:09,208 --> 00:54:10,292
In you?

890
00:54:10,875 --> 00:54:11,958
Difficult, sir.

891
00:54:12,208 --> 00:54:15,333
You are so gullible. You will donate blood 
even to mosquitoes!

892
00:54:15,417 --> 00:54:18,417
Sir, my ambition in life 
is to commit one murder.

893
00:54:19,542 --> 00:54:21,042
-Really? 
-Yes, sir.

894
00:54:21,208 --> 00:54:23,208
-Who is the target? 
-My daughter-in-law.

895
00:54:23,458 --> 00:54:24,375
A real wicked witch!

896
00:54:24,625 --> 00:54:25,958
My son fell in love and married her.

897
00:54:26,208 --> 00:54:28,458
But she convinced him 
to move with her to Mumbai.

898
00:54:28,917 --> 00:54:32,125
She works in some hotel. 
Wears bright lipstick and short skirts.

899
00:54:32,250 --> 00:54:34,000
She comes across as a hooker.

900
00:54:34,250 --> 00:54:35,958
And my poor son is totally naive.

901
00:54:36,208 --> 00:54:40,167
If you have any tasteless 
or odorless poison in your pesticides,

902
00:54:40,417 --> 00:54:42,625
I can poison her 
and get rid of her forever.

903
00:54:47,042 --> 00:54:48,875
So then it is true?

904
00:54:49,125 --> 00:54:49,958
True, sir.

905
00:54:51,375 --> 00:54:53,292
Your daughter-in-law told me.

906
00:54:53,958 --> 00:54:56,750
This plan of yours to kill her 
has been brewing for a long time.

907
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,708
She hired me to preempt 
your plan by killing you.

908
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:02,500
I verified it by playing a prank on you,

909
00:55:02,792 --> 00:55:04,833
whether she is telling the truth or not.

910
00:55:05,125 --> 00:55:06,542
Now I know she is isn't lying.

911
00:55:06,792 --> 00:55:09,208
You bloody scoundrel!

912
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:11,625
Before you reach Mumbai, 
I'll pickle you to pieces 30 times!

913
00:55:11,875 --> 00:55:12,958
Sir...

914
00:55:16,750 --> 00:55:18,375
Did I scare you again?

915
00:55:18,917 --> 00:55:21,042
[evil laughter]

916
00:55:23,792 --> 00:55:25,875
I scared you again!

917
00:55:26,250 --> 00:55:28,667
I scared you again!

918
00:55:29,125 --> 00:55:30,458
[vocalizing]

919
00:55:33,792 --> 00:55:37,042
[evil laughter]

920
00:55:40,292 --> 00:55:42,583
Who are you actually, sir? 
Please don't kill me.

921
00:55:43,083 --> 00:55:45,375
It is a long journey. 
I thought I would have some fun.

922
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:47,542
A friendly passenger 
like you is an inspiration!

923
00:55:47,625 --> 00:55:51,583
Sir, in my entire life 
I have never inspired anyone so violently!

924
00:55:53,083 --> 00:55:54,667
-Now, can I watch this film? 
-Go ahead, sir.

925
00:55:54,917 --> 00:55:56,833
You must have missed many murders.

926
00:55:58,875 --> 00:56:00,417
[horror movie continues playing 
over mobile]

927
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,167
Brutal!

928
00:57:00,583 --> 00:57:02,542
[mobile ringing]

929
00:57:08,625 --> 00:57:09,958
-Hello. 
-Hello.

930
00:57:10,458 --> 00:57:11,958
I thought of calling you myself.

931
00:57:12,333 --> 00:57:13,667
How is it going?

932
00:57:15,042 --> 00:57:18,000
Maybe the next murder 
won't be in Hyderabad.

933
00:57:18,917 --> 00:57:22,667
Yeah, I have a hunch that it could happen  
 in another town also.

934
00:57:22,917 --> 00:57:23,958
Oh, really?

935
00:57:24,125 --> 00:57:28,000
Address of his next crime scene 
is in the form of a riddle.

936
00:57:28,125 --> 00:57:30,458
But I feel it is in 
some sort of code language.

937
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:32,417
Really?

938
00:57:33,958 --> 00:57:34,875
What is the address?

939
00:57:34,958 --> 00:57:37,167
To know that you have to come 
to another address.

940
00:57:37,375 --> 00:57:38,208
Where?

941
00:57:38,417 --> 00:57:40,458
104, Sagar Society, Srinagar colony.

942
00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:42,583
My house.

943
00:57:42,750 --> 00:57:43,583
What?

944
00:57:44,125 --> 00:57:45,292
Today is my birthday.

945
00:57:47,750 --> 00:57:49,542
Hey! Many happy returns of the day.

946
00:57:49,792 --> 00:57:53,208
Thank you. Actually, I hate 
cake cutting and celebration, etc.

947
00:57:53,375 --> 00:57:56,667
But if you come home tonight, 
we can have my mom's special fish curry.

948
00:57:57,750 --> 00:58:00,542
You know the pressures of this case.

949
00:58:00,875 --> 00:58:02,333
Hey, I know. I know.

950
00:58:03,292 --> 00:58:06,750
But if you come home, 
we can solve the riddle together.

951
00:58:07,458 --> 00:58:08,292
Okay.

952
00:58:34,750 --> 00:58:39,792
"Waiting for you, time stops forever 
But still I wait with wide-eyed fervor"

953
00:58:40,167 --> 00:58:45,333
"My heart doesn't listen even if I assure 
That my love is on his way for sure"

954
00:58:45,583 --> 00:58:50,667
"Waiting for your arrival with expectance 
Without blinking my eyes even once"

955
00:58:50,875 --> 00:58:55,542
"My thoughts swirl around you only 
Whatever work I may be immersed in daily"

956
00:58:55,750 --> 00:59:01,333
"My thoughts refuse to settle somehow 
Unless they set eyes on you now"

957
00:59:01,583 --> 00:59:04,375
"When my eager imagination 
Is kindled by teasing anticipation"

958
00:59:04,458 --> 00:59:06,917
"Coming, I am coming for sure"

959
00:59:09,958 --> 00:59:12,458
"Will I take no for an answer?"

960
00:59:15,208 --> 00:59:18,333
"Even if my eyes are oblivious 
To your invitation obvious"

961
00:59:20,458 --> 00:59:23,333
"I come to you like a rising tide 
From which no one can hide"

962
00:59:25,417 --> 00:59:30,667
"Waiting for you, time stops forever 
But still I wait with wide-eyed fervor"

963
00:59:30,917 --> 00:59:36,125
"My heart won't listen come what may 
Though I insist my hero is on his way"

964
01:00:05,875 --> 01:00:11,000
"Thoughts of you hastened me 
To come running to you breathlessly"

965
01:00:11,250 --> 01:00:15,542
"Like the waves, every step of the way 
Was like high tide in love's sway"

966
01:00:16,625 --> 01:00:21,708
"Hope this distance melts away, 
Hours become minutes without delay"

967
01:00:21,958 --> 01:00:25,917
"To quench my desire with relish 
With the elixir of life I cherish"

968
01:00:26,167 --> 01:00:31,333
"I am dressed to kill 
Your desires to fulfill"

969
01:00:31,458 --> 01:00:35,250
"Come close to me 
I'll surrender to you willingly"

970
01:00:35,375 --> 01:00:37,875
"Your deal signed with love"

971
01:00:40,625 --> 01:00:43,000
"Should solve my troubles now"

972
01:00:45,917 --> 01:00:48,875
"I beseech this night divine 
To cast a spell and make you mine"

973
01:00:51,333 --> 01:00:54,125
"Wave its wand magically 
So it's just you and me"

974
01:00:56,667 --> 01:00:59,375
"Coming, I am coming for sure"

975
01:01:01,875 --> 01:01:04,458
"Will I take no for an answer?"

976
01:01:07,250 --> 01:01:10,292
"Even if my eyes are oblivious 
To your invitation obvious"

977
01:01:12,667 --> 01:01:15,333
"I come to you like a rising tide 
From which none can hide"

978
01:01:25,042 --> 01:01:30,917
"Waiting for you, time stops forever 
But still I wait with wide-eyed fervor"

979
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:37,000
"My heart doesn't listen even if I assure 
That my love is on his way for sure"

980
01:01:37,208 --> 01:01:38,667
[waves rustling]

981
01:01:40,083 --> 01:01:41,125
[laughter]

982
01:01:41,458 --> 01:01:43,167
So in that room, she and I,

983
01:01:43,333 --> 01:01:46,958
I was this solid bachelor 
like Vijay Sethupathi in "96".

984
01:01:47,625 --> 01:01:50,083
And Sreelu was a hungry tigress 
waiting to pounce on her prey.

985
01:01:50,250 --> 01:01:51,875
Hey! What are you saying?

986
01:01:52,292 --> 01:01:54,292
I was just like a sitting duck, you know.

987
01:01:55,542 --> 01:01:56,667
That fateful night

988
01:01:57,167 --> 01:01:59,208
result of our mistake was

989
01:01:59,458 --> 01:02:00,458
Apoorva.

990
01:02:00,958 --> 01:02:02,417
One month before our wedding...

991
01:02:02,542 --> 01:02:05,458
-Will you stop it and finish your dinner?-Sitting duck.

992
01:02:05,625 --> 01:02:06,958
Sitting duck.

993
01:02:07,125 --> 01:02:08,042
Shit!

994
01:02:08,750 --> 01:02:10,542
-Adi? 
-Did he just say "Shit"?

995
01:02:10,792 --> 01:02:12,250
Did I blurt out anything wrong?

996
01:02:12,417 --> 01:02:14,792
-Adi, what's going on?  
-Yes! Yes!

997
01:02:14,875 --> 01:02:17,167
-Hey! What happened? 
-Nothing.

998
01:02:17,333 --> 01:02:18,458
Just give me one second.

999
01:02:18,583 --> 01:02:20,708
Knowing that your generation 
is cool about premarital sex,

1000
01:02:20,833 --> 01:02:22,417
I shared my personal stuff.

1001
01:02:22,625 --> 01:02:24,458
-I am sorry. Sorry... 
-No, uncle. No.

1002
01:02:24,625 --> 01:02:25,667
You know Bombay duck?

1003
01:02:25,833 --> 01:02:26,958
Bombay duck?

1004
01:02:27,125 --> 01:02:28,958
-It's a fish, right? 
-We can't get it here, son.

1005
01:02:29,083 --> 01:02:31,042
-You don't get it... 
-Aunty, just one minute.

1006
01:02:31,125 --> 01:02:33,083
"A bird that isn't a bird," 
Bombay duck is a fish, right?

1007
01:02:33,625 --> 01:02:36,083
"Cut its tail," so if you remove "duck" 
from "Bombay duck?"

1008
01:02:36,250 --> 01:02:38,167
-Bombay. 
-"Look for the sun amidst the darkness."

1009
01:02:38,292 --> 01:02:39,958
Tell me a place in Bombay 
that means "night?"

1010
01:02:40,042 --> 01:02:42,000
Darkness? Night means...

1011
01:02:42,083 --> 01:02:43,167
Andheri!

1012
01:02:43,583 --> 01:02:44,958
Where does the sun rise?

1013
01:02:45,375 --> 01:02:47,000
Simple, east.

1014
01:02:48,333 --> 01:02:49,292
Oh, shit!

1015
01:02:49,375 --> 01:02:51,292
-Andheri East! 
-Exactly!

1016
01:02:53,083 --> 01:02:55,500
The king's horse is beckoning you

1017
01:02:57,208 --> 01:02:58,500
I need your laptop.

1018
01:03:08,125 --> 01:03:10,458
Famous kings of Maharashtra.

1019
01:03:11,792 --> 01:03:13,042
Of course, Shivaji.

1020
01:03:13,167 --> 01:03:16,042
Then "King's horse," Shivaji's horse...

1021
01:03:16,125 --> 01:03:16,958
-Vishwas. 
-Vishwas.

1022
01:03:17,042 --> 01:03:18,125
[mobile ringing]

1023
01:03:18,750 --> 01:03:20,042
-Sir. 
-Shekar,

1024
01:03:20,292 --> 01:03:21,625
I'm sending you some images.

1025
01:03:21,750 --> 01:03:25,292
Check if any part matches 
with the pattern on the cloth we found.

1026
01:03:25,333 --> 01:03:26,208
-Quick. 
-Okay, sir.

1027
01:03:26,292 --> 01:03:27,458
Yeah.

1028
01:03:30,667 --> 01:03:32,083
-Sir? 
-Yes, Mansoor.

1029
01:03:32,208 --> 01:03:34,542
We have to take the next flight 
to Mumbai immediately.

1030
01:03:34,750 --> 01:03:35,750
Book the next flight to Mumbai.

1031
01:03:35,833 --> 01:03:38,042
Contact the police station 
at Andheri East.

1032
01:03:38,167 --> 01:03:40,125
Look for any hotel 
or lodge by the name Vishwas.

1033
01:03:40,208 --> 01:03:41,042
Okay, sir.

1034
01:03:41,125 --> 01:03:42,417
If so, we have to raid it at once.

1035
01:03:42,583 --> 01:03:43,625
Killer might be there.

1036
01:03:43,708 --> 01:03:45,750
In the meantime, I will talk 
to the DCP in Andheri.

1037
01:03:45,833 --> 01:03:46,667
Done, sir.

1038
01:03:46,750 --> 01:03:47,958
-Okay? 
-Done, sir.

1039
01:03:49,792 --> 01:03:51,917
You were right. 
His clue indicated the venue.

1040
01:03:52,042 --> 01:03:54,333
So the next murder 
maybe in hotel Vishwas in Mumbai.

1041
01:03:54,458 --> 01:03:56,417
I'm going to get him 
this time for sure and you...

1042
01:03:57,250 --> 01:03:58,417
You're brilliant. Bye.

1043
01:04:04,875 --> 01:04:08,042
[mobile ringing]

1044
01:04:09,292 --> 01:04:10,208
Hello, Shekar, yeah?

1045
01:04:10,333 --> 01:04:12,042
I got one matching image, sir.

1046
01:04:12,167 --> 01:04:14,750
It looks like a hotel logo, 
but I can't find the hotel name in Google.

1047
01:04:14,875 --> 01:04:16,667
Email me the image immediately.

1048
01:04:16,833 --> 01:04:17,667
Okay, sir.

1049
01:04:19,375 --> 01:04:20,208
Yes, sir.

1050
01:04:20,292 --> 01:04:21,125
ANDHERI POLICE STATION

1051
01:04:21,208 --> 01:04:22,583
Yes, sir. Sure, sir.

1052
01:04:23,750 --> 01:04:24,750
Immediately, sir.

1053
01:04:25,042 --> 01:04:26,750
-Kaushik. 
-Yes, sir?

1054
01:04:27,458 --> 01:04:29,083
-DCP sir called me just now. 
-Sir.

1055
01:04:29,208 --> 01:04:31,125
Is there a hotel in Andheri 
by name Vishwas?

1056
01:04:50,042 --> 01:04:51,167
All set for Mumbai, sir.

1057
01:04:51,292 --> 01:04:53,708
CCTV footage at Kanakadurga bar 
has been deleted it seems.

1058
01:04:53,833 --> 01:04:55,750
-I've told them to retrieve it. 
-We'll nab him directly, Mansoor.

1059
01:04:55,833 --> 01:04:56,875
I'm sure we will get him, sir.

[tires screeching]

1063
01:05:44,042 --> 01:05:46,167
Yes, Inspector Rajath. 
We've reached Mumbai.

1064
01:05:47,292 --> 01:05:48,625
Great! We'll see you soon.

1065
01:05:49,167 --> 01:05:50,208
Drive to Mahakali caves.

1066
01:05:50,583 --> 01:05:51,833
[train horn blowing in distant]

1067
01:05:53,583 --> 01:05:55,125
Hi, I'm KK.

1068
01:06:15,292 --> 01:06:16,167
Start counting.

1069
01:06:16,250 --> 01:06:18,500
If the total falls short, 
you won't be able to leave Mumbai.

1070
01:06:18,583 --> 01:06:19,625
Oh!

1071
01:06:20,417 --> 01:06:21,833
You know Telugu!

1072
01:06:38,208 --> 01:06:40,208
You didn't tell me 
who gave you my number.

1073
01:06:40,333 --> 01:06:41,375
How does it matter?

1074
01:06:42,333 --> 01:06:43,500
We've finished our business.

1075
01:06:43,625 --> 01:06:44,750
Is this what you do?

1076
01:06:46,417 --> 01:06:47,833
This is just a side business.

1077
01:06:48,750 --> 01:06:50,333
My main business is different.

1078
01:06:50,542 --> 01:06:51,417
What is it?

1079
01:07:01,792 --> 01:07:03,208
I catch snakes.

1080
01:07:03,417 --> 01:07:05,417
[laughing]

1081
01:07:10,542 --> 01:07:11,917
It's the truth.

1082
01:07:12,083 --> 01:07:13,667
Are these guns for that purpose?

1083
01:07:17,042 --> 01:07:19,875
In the olden days, snakes could be killed 
with stout sticks.

1084
01:07:20,708 --> 01:07:22,000
Now it isn't so.

1085
01:07:22,917 --> 01:07:24,250
I have no other option.

-Yes, sir.

-What is the case? 
-We'll know very soon.

Sir, watch out!

1110
01:09:36,792 --> 01:09:38,000
Nab him!

Sir, he is jumping out.

1113
01:09:41,417 --> 01:09:42,708
Look, he has jumped out.

1114
01:09:42,833 --> 01:09:43,833
Nab him!

1115
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:45,000
Search thoroughly.

1116
01:09:45,125 --> 01:09:46,542

And when I do, bear in mind,  
 I'll personally perform your last rites.

1130
01:11:05,917 --> 01:11:07,167
The bastard escaped.

1131
01:11:07,292 --> 01:11:08,208
Shit!

1132
01:11:09,500 --> 01:11:10,417
Sir.

1133
01:11:10,542 --> 01:11:12,292
I guess you have to come back, sir.

1134
01:11:12,458 --> 01:11:13,417
What happened?

1135
01:11:27,250 --> 01:11:30,958
"We will ensure our golden boy drinks 
the most expensive wine next time."

1136
01:11:34,250 --> 01:11:36,333
Clues team and forensics 
are on the way, sir.

1137
01:11:36,792 --> 01:11:38,542
This bugger is nuts, sir.

[mobile ringing]

1139
01:11:52,917 --> 01:11:53,875
Hello?

1140
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:55,917
I almost got caught, right?

1141
01:11:57,875 --> 01:11:59,917
I need to quit smoking this grass.

1142
01:12:02,125 --> 01:12:04,375
You aren't the weak candidate 
I assumed you to be.

1143
01:12:04,833 --> 01:12:07,167
I realized it as soon as 
I saw you in Sai Sri lodge.

1144
01:12:08,750 --> 01:12:09,583
What?

1145
01:12:09,833 --> 01:12:10,750
I mean that Vicky.

1146
01:12:11,583 --> 01:12:13,042
I was in the next room.

1147
01:12:14,292 --> 01:12:15,750
I even tried to meet you.

1148
01:12:16,542 --> 01:12:18,000
You pushed me away.

1149
01:12:24,417 --> 01:12:25,667
Your days are numbered.

1151
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:28,833
How then?

01:12:30,125 --> 01:12:31,417
Must speed up my pace.

1153
01:12:32,708 --> 01:12:33,708
Let me indulge you.

1154
01:12:35,667 --> 01:12:37,542
I'll send you a bonus clue.

1155
01:12:39,125 --> 01:12:40,458
You will love it.

1156
01:12:40,583 --> 01:12:41,542
Take a look.

1157
01:12:42,375 --> 01:12:43,417
Hello?

1158
01:12:45,750 --> 01:12:46,875
Man up.

1159
01:12:54,500 --> 01:12:55,333
[mobile chimes]

1160
01:13:02,375 --> 01:13:03,792
What's this message, sir?

1161
01:13:03,958 --> 01:13:07,375
-His next victim is a kid? 
-No, no.

1162
01:13:09,792 --> 01:13:11,333
Do you know who this kid is?

1163
01:13:11,917 --> 01:13:12,958
Who is he, sir?

1164
01:13:14,125 --> 01:13:15,125
Me.

1165
01:13:16,042 --> 01:13:17,458
This is my childhood snap.

1166
01:13:20,125 --> 01:13:20,958
[mobile chimes]

1167
01:13:25,125 --> 01:13:26,917
"Have you forgotten me?"

1168
01:13:36,417 --> 01:13:37,750
He is my schoolmate.

1169
01:13:58,125 --> 01:14:00,458
GOVERNMENT HIGHER 
SECONDARY SCHOOL, BHEEMILI

1170
01:14:03,250 --> 01:14:05,667
That's me, in the first row, sir.  
 I remember the rest of them.

1171
01:14:05,750 --> 01:14:08,875
I think that's Vishnu at the back 
Do you know anything about him?

1172
01:14:09,917 --> 01:14:10,833
I'm sorry.

1173
01:14:11,292 --> 01:14:14,750
There's no way I'll recognize anyone 
because I took over recently.

1174
01:14:17,458 --> 01:14:19,208
Any teacher still here from my batch?

1175
01:14:19,292 --> 01:14:20,667
Yes, he is Yendluri Vishnu.

1176
01:14:20,833 --> 01:14:22,833
D Section. The best sportsman!

1177
01:14:22,917 --> 01:14:24,667
Everybody's favorite 
in sports and studies.

1178
01:14:24,750 --> 01:14:25,792
Don't you remember?

1179
01:14:27,375 --> 01:14:28,542
I vaguely remember.

1180
01:14:28,875 --> 01:14:30,667
-Where is he now? 
-No idea.

1181
01:14:30,750 --> 01:14:33,167
Didn't he leave all of a sudden 
halfway through 10th grade?

1182
01:14:33,417 --> 01:14:36,458
His family was steeped in debts 
and some personal problems.

1183
01:14:36,542 --> 01:14:38,250
I heard they were forced 
to leave this town.

1184
01:14:38,333 --> 01:14:41,958
When I accidentally met him in Vizag, 
he said he was studying in another school.

1185
01:14:42,042 --> 01:14:44,958
And had joined the army 
when he passed out of school.

1186
01:14:45,042 --> 01:14:46,875
I haven't met him till date.

1187
01:14:47,417 --> 01:14:51,042
I know a Rathnakumar in Vizag 
who enlisted in the army along with him.

1188
01:14:52,125 --> 01:14:53,833
Why don't you meet him?

1189
01:14:59,208 --> 01:15:01,125
Excuse me, 
is this Rathnakumar's residence?

1190
01:15:01,208 --> 01:15:02,667
-Yes, sir. 
-Can I please meet him?

1191
01:15:11,667 --> 01:15:12,500
Please take it.

1192
01:15:12,917 --> 01:15:13,917
I'm good.

1193
01:15:14,292 --> 01:15:16,250
Though Vishnu and I were in the same unit,

1194
01:15:16,333 --> 01:15:18,333
we didn't share a great rapport at first.

1195
01:15:20,667 --> 01:15:22,833
Three years ago, 
we were part of an operation in Kupwara.

1196
01:15:24,708 --> 01:15:27,125
We heard some terrorists  
 had occupied a house by force

1197
01:15:27,208 --> 01:15:29,083
and holding the family hostage.

1198
01:15:29,167 --> 01:15:30,875
[gunshots]

1199
01:15:34,917 --> 01:15:36,292
Are you a fan of director Boyapati Srinu, 
known for his action films?

1200
01:15:38,417 --> 01:15:39,458
That's reel life.

1201
01:15:41,042 --> 01:15:42,042
This is real life.

1202
01:15:42,875 --> 01:15:44,500
[gunshots]

1203
01:15:51,042 --> 01:15:52,333
Alpha Tiger, got an idea, sir.

1204
01:15:52,417 --> 01:15:53,417
-Order. 
-Okay, okay.

1205
01:15:53,500 --> 01:15:54,917
-Fire and move. 
-Rathna.

1206
01:15:55,333 --> 01:15:56,625
[gunshots]

1207
01:16:26,625 --> 01:16:28,208
[gunshots]

1208
01:16:55,583 --> 01:16:57,000
[indistinct]

1209
01:16:57,542 --> 01:16:58,417
Shoot!

1210
01:17:20,708 --> 01:17:21,875
[groans]

1211
01:17:33,583 --> 01:17:35,333
[gunshots]

1212
01:17:47,583 --> 01:17:50,042
[groaning]

1213
01:17:57,458 --> 01:17:58,875
DSP sir, looks like he's a minor.

1214
01:17:58,958 --> 01:18:01,167
Inspect his documentation thoroughly.

1215
01:18:01,458 --> 01:18:02,917
He must be 15-years-old.

1216
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:04,375
Fine, take him.

1217
01:18:05,375 --> 01:18:07,042
But such vengefulness at that age.

1218
01:18:08,792 --> 01:18:12,042
The terrorists we kill 
are just virus from outside, Rathna.

1219
01:18:13,958 --> 01:18:15,083
But this is

1220
01:18:15,833 --> 01:18:17,083
internal wound.

1221
01:18:18,667 --> 01:18:19,917
Internal bleeding.

1222
01:18:21,583 --> 01:18:25,292
There is no point killing the virus 
if we don't heal that wound.

1223
01:18:26,708 --> 01:18:29,125
Vishnu lost his parents  
 when he was a 15-year-old.

1224
01:18:29,167 --> 01:18:30,375
Maybe that's why

1225
01:18:30,792 --> 01:18:34,000
his fervent wish 
was to have a family of his own.

1226
01:18:35,625 --> 01:18:37,917
Once during our vacation, 
we were headed to Vizag.

1227
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:39,333
We halted on the way 
to visit a friend in Hyderabad.

1228
01:18:40,208 --> 01:18:42,208
We wanted to buy a gift  
 for the friend's family.

1229
01:18:42,292 --> 01:18:43,583
We walked into Lepakshi Emporium.

1230
01:18:44,042 --> 01:18:45,250
Good morning, sir.

1231
01:18:45,333 --> 01:18:47,333
Do you have any wood-carved 
miniature pagodas?

1232
01:18:47,542 --> 01:18:48,833
Of course, sir. Please.

1233
01:18:50,417 --> 01:18:51,250
Saheba?

1234
01:18:52,875 --> 01:18:53,792
Attend to these customers.

1235
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:55,250
Show them miniature wood-carved pagodas.

1236
01:19:04,542 --> 01:19:05,417
Please follow me.

1237
01:19:06,667 --> 01:19:07,500
What name did he call her by?

1238
01:19:08,958 --> 01:19:10,292
Sounded like "Saheba."

1239
01:19:11,083 --> 01:19:13,458
Why did my ears hear it as "Jehovah?"

1240
01:19:13,542 --> 01:19:14,667
Come along now.

1241
01:19:16,208 --> 01:19:17,292
Here, this is one model.

1242
01:19:17,875 --> 01:19:18,750
Take a look, sir.

1243
01:19:19,958 --> 01:19:21,292
It's made in Kondapalli.

1244
01:19:21,500 --> 01:19:22,625
And this is another model.

1245
01:19:24,542 --> 01:19:26,167
Made in Kondapalli.

1246
01:19:28,417 --> 01:19:29,417
Are you in the army?

1247
01:19:33,458 --> 01:19:34,542
How did you know?

1248
01:19:39,625 --> 01:19:40,625
Right.

1249
01:19:41,042 --> 01:19:42,292
[clears throat]

1250
01:19:46,125 --> 01:19:46,958
Are you on vacation?

1251
01:19:48,750 --> 01:19:49,750
Yes, ma'am.

1252
01:19:50,292 --> 01:19:51,375
Too busy guarding our nation,

1253
01:19:51,583 --> 01:19:52,625
we ignored the importance 
of beautiful women.

1254
01:19:52,792 --> 01:19:53,750
Ahem.

1255
01:19:54,250 --> 01:19:57,250
I mean, "issues."

1256
01:19:57,417 --> 01:20:00,250
That's why we are doing 
a nationwide tour now.

1257
01:20:00,708 --> 01:20:01,917
Nice!

1258
01:20:02,250 --> 01:20:03,542
What are the places in your itinerary?

1259
01:20:06,375 --> 01:20:08,292
We wasted our time 
drifting aimlessly till now.

1260
01:20:08,917 --> 01:20:10,125
Now I've found my anchor.

1261
01:20:10,917 --> 01:20:12,458
-I am ready to settle here. 
-Really?

1262
01:20:13,042 --> 01:20:15,375
I have discovered the uniqueness 
of our country today.

1263
01:20:15,583 --> 01:20:17,125
Hey, hey, slow down!

1264
01:20:18,042 --> 01:20:19,167
Courtesy our Lepakshi.

1265
01:20:19,833 --> 01:20:20,667
Ahem!

1266
01:20:20,750 --> 01:20:22,167
You have Bidri-style metal handicraft?

1267
01:20:22,250 --> 01:20:23,500
Yes, after you see these...

1268
01:20:23,583 --> 01:20:25,250
Show us all that you have.

1269
01:20:25,333 --> 01:20:26,875
We have all the time in the world.

1270
01:20:26,958 --> 01:20:28,458
Elephants, horses, palm trees,

1271
01:20:28,500 --> 01:20:30,125
idols of Ganesha, Shiva, 
boys collecting toddy...

1272
01:20:30,208 --> 01:20:31,167
Enough, dude.

1273
01:20:31,250 --> 01:20:33,125
Dolls of women nodding 
their pretty heads, the whole works.

1274
01:20:34,125 --> 01:20:35,708
First take a look 
at these miniature pagodas.

1275
01:20:36,542 --> 01:20:37,458
Where are you going?

1276
01:20:38,958 --> 01:20:40,625
Please be here with us 
to show us everything.

1277
01:20:41,625 --> 01:20:42,625
What about the Bidri items?

1278
01:20:44,875 --> 01:20:46,167
-You have to get that, right? 
-Right.

1279
01:20:46,292 --> 01:20:47,250
Please bring it.

1280
01:20:47,917 --> 01:20:49,875
But come back soon.

1281
01:20:57,667 --> 01:20:59,667
Vishnu, what's up with you?

1282
01:21:00,333 --> 01:21:01,917
Is she mad or what?

1283
01:21:02,417 --> 01:21:04,708
How can she be 
so unfairly, insanely beautiful?

1284
01:21:07,500 --> 01:21:08,417
Wait, she'll come.

1285
01:21:09,125 --> 01:21:10,333
I can't wait any longer.

1286
01:21:10,458 --> 01:21:11,625
Hey, hey!

1287
01:21:14,292 --> 01:21:15,583
Can we share it?

1288
01:21:15,833 --> 01:21:16,792
What?

1289
01:21:18,792 --> 01:21:19,667
Weight!

1290
01:21:26,875 --> 01:21:28,417
Do you know what Lepakshi means?

1291
01:21:29,417 --> 01:21:30,708
Translates as, "Get up, bird."

1292
01:21:33,333 --> 01:21:34,625
Someone explained this to me.

1293
01:21:35,208 --> 01:21:36,375
In Ramayana,

1294
01:21:36,458 --> 01:21:39,125
Lepakshi is the place where Jatayu, 
the divine vulture, was wounded.

1295
01:21:39,458 --> 01:21:42,333
Lord Rama told Jatayu, "Get up, bird."

1296
01:21:45,083 --> 01:21:47,417
Some dodo has given you 
a dumb explanation.

1297
01:21:49,958 --> 01:21:51,042
Lepakshi means

1298
01:21:51,167 --> 01:21:55,625
the girl who has her eyes lined with kohl 
that is used to draw divine works of art.

1299
01:21:56,292 --> 01:21:57,125
Oh!

1300
01:22:00,500 --> 01:22:04,042
You are a standing example 
of the emporium's name matching the staff!

1301
01:22:06,500 --> 01:22:08,958
You seem to possess an overdose 
of general knowledge.

1302
01:22:09,167 --> 01:22:10,250
Generally, I don't.

1303
01:22:11,917 --> 01:22:13,375
But today it is going a little overboard.

1304
01:22:39,792 --> 01:22:43,667
"Somehow at this moment in time 
My mind reels"

1305
01:22:43,833 --> 01:22:47,125
"In a dizzy spin sublime"

1306
01:22:47,917 --> 01:22:51,750
"My youth dances in dazed wonder"

1307
01:22:51,833 --> 01:22:54,875
"To your magic spell I surrender"

1308
01:22:55,125 --> 01:22:59,000
"Don't tickle and tease me princess 
And bewitch me senseless"

1309
01:22:59,125 --> 01:23:02,542
"More the reason for your charm 
To imprison me in your arm"

1310
01:23:02,625 --> 01:23:06,250
"My smart sweetheart so precious"

1311
01:23:06,583 --> 01:23:09,125
"My darling Night-blooming Cereus"

1312
01:23:10,625 --> 01:23:13,667
"Swathed in your hug so snug"

1313
01:23:14,417 --> 01:23:17,792
"I want to listen to a soothing song"

1314
01:23:19,875 --> 01:23:23,708
"At this moment in time my mind reels"

1315
01:23:23,917 --> 01:23:27,625
"In a dizzy spin divine"

1316
01:23:27,917 --> 01:23:31,792
"My youth swirls in surprised wonder"

1317
01:23:31,958 --> 01:23:35,500
"To your magic spell I surrender"

1318
01:23:57,792 --> 01:24:01,792
"Step by step walk beside me 
As my blessing"

1319
01:24:01,958 --> 01:24:05,125
"And boon for eternity"

1320
01:24:05,625 --> 01:24:09,375
"I give my life and all of myself to you"

1321
01:24:09,458 --> 01:24:13,250
"King of my heart and soul"

1322
01:24:13,417 --> 01:24:16,833
"A floral boat in the wind afloat"

1323
01:24:17,167 --> 01:24:21,042
"Gently row to-and-fro"

1324
01:24:21,167 --> 01:24:24,958
"Won't you come near me, my beau?"

1325
01:24:25,208 --> 01:24:28,625
"Won't you let me pamper you?"

1326
01:24:29,875 --> 01:24:33,667
"Somehow at this moment in time 
My mind reels"

1327
01:24:33,833 --> 01:24:37,500
"In a dizzy spin sublime"

1328
01:24:37,708 --> 01:24:41,833
"My youth dances in dazed wonder"

1329
01:24:42,208 --> 01:24:45,625
"To your magic spell I surrender"

1330
01:25:07,833 --> 01:25:10,250
"My mind whispers secrets this instant"

1331
01:25:10,375 --> 01:25:11,333
HERE?

1332
01:25:11,458 --> 01:25:15,042
"Like the ebb and flow of waves constant"

1333
01:25:15,792 --> 01:25:19,833
"From this day I will be 
Your beloved wife blessed"

1334
01:25:19,958 --> 01:25:23,125
"With the benediction of a new life"

1335
01:25:23,333 --> 01:25:26,958
"I have preserved my life in you"

1336
01:25:27,542 --> 01:25:31,292
"A passionate symbol of my love so true"

1337
01:25:31,458 --> 01:25:32,292
CHECK UNDER THE PILLOW

1338
01:25:32,375 --> 01:25:35,083
"I have enfolded your dreams within me"

1339
01:25:35,250 --> 01:25:36,292
OPEN THE CUPBOARD

1340
01:25:36,625 --> 01:25:39,667
"Let them come true swinging gently"

1341
01:25:39,833 --> 01:25:43,708
"Somehow at this moment in time 
My heart reels"

1342
01:25:43,875 --> 01:25:47,333
"In a dizzy spin sublime"

1343
01:25:47,833 --> 01:25:51,833
"My youth waltzes in awestruck wonder"

1344
01:25:52,125 --> 01:25:55,417
"To your magic spell I surrender"

1345
01:25:55,500 --> 01:25:59,083
"Don't tickle and tease me, princess 
And bewitch me senseless"

1346
01:25:59,208 --> 01:26:02,500
"More the reason for your charm 
To imprison me in your arm"

1347
01:26:02,667 --> 01:26:06,542
"My smart sweetheart so precious"

1348
01:26:06,833 --> 01:26:10,208
"My darling night-blooming queen"

1349
01:26:10,583 --> 01:26:13,833
"Swathed in your hug so snug"

1350
01:26:14,750 --> 01:26:19,458
"I want to listen to a soothing song"

1351
01:26:42,250 --> 01:26:43,333
What is this, Vishnu?

1352
01:26:43,417 --> 01:26:45,958
I've already granted you 
special leave twice so far.

1353
01:26:46,083 --> 01:26:48,542
Do you think you can take off 
once a month till your wife delivers?

1354
01:26:48,625 --> 01:26:51,750
Nayak, Vishnu and his wife 
have no relatives to lend a hand, sir.

1355
01:26:51,875 --> 01:26:53,708
You have ten more men in your battalion.

1356
01:26:53,792 --> 01:26:56,625
Their respective wives manage 
even if they are alone, right?

1357
01:26:56,833 --> 01:26:57,958
I'm sure you can do the same.

1358
01:26:58,292 --> 01:26:59,750
-Sir, just this once... 
-No, no, no.

1359
01:26:59,917 --> 01:27:02,000
Not possible. This is army protocol.

1360
01:27:02,125 --> 01:27:03,750
The same rules apply to all.

1361
01:27:03,917 --> 01:27:05,458
You are well aware of this.

1362
01:27:05,625 --> 01:27:07,458
Still I have to waste time 
explaining it to you?

1363
01:27:07,625 --> 01:27:09,125
Make an alternative arrangement.

1364
01:27:09,250 --> 01:27:10,208
Take him now.

1365
01:27:10,292 --> 01:27:11,917
Nayak, Vishnu. Break the line.

1366
01:27:17,542 --> 01:27:19,083
It's really tough here, Saheba.

1367
01:27:20,458 --> 01:27:21,375
My leave was denied.

1368
01:27:25,375 --> 01:27:26,417
I'll try once again.

1369
01:27:28,208 --> 01:27:29,167
Okay.

1370
01:27:30,292 --> 01:27:31,208
Take care of yourself.

1371
01:27:40,542 --> 01:27:42,625
The very next day  
 after his request was rejected,

1372
01:27:43,125 --> 01:27:45,708
our unit had to respond 
to an emergency call.

1373
01:27:46,917 --> 01:27:50,083
The terrorists were hiding  
 in a village in Kupwara,

1374
01:27:50,208 --> 01:27:52,833
in a dilapidated building,  
 was the information we got.

1375
01:27:52,958 --> 01:27:54,167
Risky territory.

1376
01:27:54,542 --> 01:27:55,625
Limited time.

1377
01:27:55,958 --> 01:27:57,083
But we went ahead.

1378
01:27:58,250 --> 01:28:01,125
I have never seen Vishnu so dejected.

1379
01:28:02,125 --> 01:28:03,958
It seemed like a bad omen to me.

1380
01:28:05,083 --> 01:28:06,542
My fear turned into the worst nightmare.

1381
01:28:07,375 --> 01:28:09,333
[explosion]

1382
01:28:45,750 --> 01:28:47,625
That was the last time I saw Vishnu.

1383
01:28:49,875 --> 01:28:52,208
It took almost a week 
for me to recover fully.

1384
01:28:52,333 --> 01:28:55,083
It took a long time 
for our rescue team to reach you.

1385
01:28:55,625 --> 01:28:56,500
You are lucky.

1386
01:28:58,833 --> 01:28:59,750
Four of our men are missing.

1387
01:29:00,125 --> 01:29:01,583
Bodies were swept away in the river.

1388
01:29:02,208 --> 01:29:03,292
Maybe even Vishnu is...

1389
01:29:06,708 --> 01:29:07,833
We have another bad news.

1390
01:29:09,708 --> 01:29:11,333
Vishnu's wife passed away in Hyderabad.

1391
01:29:15,500 --> 01:29:16,458
Saheba is dead?

1392
01:29:19,625 --> 01:29:20,500
How?

1393
01:29:20,917 --> 01:29:22,750
Five days after the attack on us,

1394
01:29:23,458 --> 01:29:24,875
someone called and informed her.

1395
01:29:26,958 --> 01:29:28,958
She died in the communal riots

1396
01:29:30,542 --> 01:29:31,458
in Hyderabad.

1397
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:35,042
Last year,

1398
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:37,042
in the Muharram procession.

1399
01:29:37,667 --> 01:29:39,208
It was in Hyderabad, right?

1400
01:29:39,708 --> 01:29:41,375
Islamic ceremonial mourning.

1401
01:29:43,417 --> 01:29:44,292
Shit!

1402
01:29:45,250 --> 01:29:46,292
-Mansoor?-Hello, sir.

1403
01:29:46,375 --> 01:29:48,583
Check our files on Tappachabutra riots

1404
01:29:48,667 --> 01:29:50,708
file name "Saheba" 
before tomorrow morning.

1405
01:29:50,917 --> 01:29:52,208
-Immediate. Yeah.-Okay, sir.

1406
01:30:06,250 --> 01:30:09,125
What? Army, soldier, Kashmir.

1407
01:30:10,500 --> 01:30:12,208
-Yes, sir. 
-Do you have any evidence?

1408
01:30:12,375 --> 01:30:14,417
Photos he left behind, his call log,

1409
01:30:14,583 --> 01:30:15,667
his weird riddles.

1410
01:30:15,833 --> 01:30:18,250
He was your classmate. 
All these don't count as evidence.

1411
01:30:18,333 --> 01:30:22,208
Do you have any evidence that ascertains 
he is the killer without an iota of doubt?

1412
01:30:22,333 --> 01:30:25,583
Sir, he has motive 
and sufficient reason to kill.

1413
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,042
Because his wife died in a communal riot?

1414
01:30:28,167 --> 01:30:31,333
So he is against the police force 
and you in particular, is it?

1415
01:30:31,500 --> 01:30:34,375
The photo he sent you could have been 
posted in Facebook by your classmates.

1416
01:30:34,458 --> 01:30:37,167
By using it, he may very well 
be making you run helter-skelter.

1417
01:30:37,292 --> 01:30:38,250
Just to buy time.

1418
01:30:38,375 --> 01:30:41,375
He uses stolen mobiles to call you. 
He doesn't leave any finger prints.

1419
01:30:41,542 --> 01:30:42,792
Only God can give us his DNA!

1420
01:30:42,875 --> 01:30:44,375
In fact, he leaves no clues.

1421
01:30:44,542 --> 01:30:46,625
He is treating us like worthless idiots.

1422
01:30:46,792 --> 01:30:48,042
We have nothing!

1423
01:30:52,958 --> 01:30:55,083
DGP is pointing fingers 
at us for our inefficiency.

1424
01:30:55,208 --> 01:30:57,583
DCP Sathya is having a field day 
deriding both of us.

1425
01:30:57,667 --> 01:31:00,292
He is feeding our failures 
to media like a daily TV serial.

1426
01:31:00,417 --> 01:31:01,792
My blood boils at all this!

1427
01:31:02,542 --> 01:31:03,500
Sir, trust me.

1428
01:31:04,083 --> 01:31:05,208
I won't let you down.

1429
01:31:05,917 --> 01:31:07,083
Do something and shut them up!

1430
01:31:07,250 --> 01:31:08,083
[bottle shatters]

1431
01:31:08,542 --> 01:31:11,042
We've seen the riot's footage repeatedly 
like you told us, sir.

1432
01:31:11,125 --> 01:31:12,542
This is almost the tenth time.

1433
01:31:16,417 --> 01:31:18,167
But haven't found Saheba anywhere.

1434
01:31:18,292 --> 01:31:19,458
-Not even a clue. 
-Sir

1435
01:31:20,208 --> 01:31:21,208
We got Saheba's details.

1436
01:31:21,625 --> 01:31:24,292
The man who saw her last 
is a mechanic called Rashid, sir.

1437
01:31:29,917 --> 01:31:30,792
Rashid?

1438
01:31:32,250 --> 01:31:33,458
Police.

1439
01:31:35,792 --> 01:31:39,333
I wasn't that close to Saheba or Vishnu, 
I just knew them.

1440
01:31:39,958 --> 01:31:44,542
Saheba's parents and my brother died 
in the bomb blast at Gokul Chat.

1441
01:31:45,042 --> 01:31:47,625
That's how I met Saheba.

1442
01:31:48,042 --> 01:31:52,625
She had no family of her own. 
She grew up in an orphanage.

1443
01:31:52,792 --> 01:31:53,958
And studied right there.

1444
01:31:54,417 --> 01:31:58,292
She used to coach our children  
 and take very good care of them.

1445
01:31:59,292 --> 01:32:02,500
If we went out, we would leave  
 our children with her.

1446
01:32:02,667 --> 01:32:05,333
She had a way with them.  
 They meant the world to her.

1447
01:32:05,417 --> 01:32:08,292
The last time I met her 
was during Muharram procession.

1448
01:32:08,583 --> 01:32:10,500
She greeted me with her usual cheer.

1449
01:32:10,583 --> 01:32:11,625
How are you, my dear?

1450
01:32:11,708 --> 01:32:13,542
Peace be upon you! 
By God's grace I'm good.

1451
01:32:13,583 --> 01:32:14,667
May God be with you.

1452
01:32:15,292 --> 01:32:16,250
May God be with you.

1453
01:32:16,333 --> 01:32:18,458
That was the last time I saw her, sir.

1454
01:32:20,292 --> 01:32:22,292
Same day the communal riots started.

1455
01:32:22,458 --> 01:32:24,750
We stayed put at home. 
Didn't dare to step out.

1456
01:32:25,375 --> 01:32:28,708
We assumed Saheba would have found shelter 
at some friend's place, right?

1457
01:32:29,917 --> 01:32:32,042
Did she tell you where she was going?

1458
01:32:32,833 --> 01:32:35,417
She wanted to buy a chain 
for Vishnu who was coming.

1459
01:32:35,500 --> 01:32:36,458
How much is this?

1460
01:32:36,667 --> 01:32:38,875
She was going to KC Jewelers 
at Tappachabutra center, sir.

1461
01:32:39,542 --> 01:32:42,333
After that I never met her, sir.

1462
01:32:53,167 --> 01:32:54,167
Muharram.

1463
01:32:54,250 --> 01:32:55,708
September 21st.

1464
01:32:55,792 --> 01:32:57,042
Last year.

1465
01:32:57,542 --> 01:32:58,667
Day of the communal riots!

1466
01:32:58,875 --> 01:33:00,708
Our shop was completely ravaged.

1467
01:33:00,750 --> 01:33:02,458
It took us three months to renovate it.

1468
01:33:02,542 --> 01:33:03,458
Horrible experience, sir.

1469
01:33:09,917 --> 01:33:10,958
Her name is Saheba.

1470
01:33:11,667 --> 01:33:13,750
Did you see her in your shop 
on the day of the riots?

1471
01:33:13,875 --> 01:33:16,042
We have so many clients 
stepping in daily, sir.

1472
01:33:16,167 --> 01:33:17,458
I'm usually in my office room.

1473
01:33:17,542 --> 01:33:18,417
No chance, sir.

1474
01:33:19,167 --> 01:33:20,542
I want that day's CCTV footage.

1475
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:24,000
We delete our footage every month, sir.

1476
01:33:24,083 --> 01:33:25,583
To save space.

1477
01:33:25,667 --> 01:33:26,542
We will try to retrieve it.

1478
01:33:28,125 --> 01:33:30,375
-Mansoor will be in touch with you. 
-Okay, sir

1479
01:33:30,583 --> 01:33:32,250
-Okay, sir 
-Thank you.

1480
01:33:32,458 --> 01:33:34,542
Do I get any discount 
if I buy something here?

1481
01:33:34,750 --> 01:33:36,125
Why discount, sir? It is on the house!

1482
01:33:36,208 --> 01:33:39,208
Then my wedding purchase 
is from here. Standing robbery!

1483
01:33:39,458 --> 01:33:40,458
You are sharp as a tack!

1484
01:33:40,542 --> 01:33:42,875
-This is nothing. You will see more soon. 
-Okay, sir.

1485
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,208
-There you go, sir. 
-We won't get that footage anyway.

1486
01:33:45,417 --> 01:33:47,500
Keep him under surveillance. 
Phones, emails, etc.

1487
01:33:47,667 --> 01:33:48,958
-Order two of our boys to follow him. 
-Done, sir.

1488
01:33:49,042 --> 01:33:50,542
But something is weird about him, sir.

1489
01:33:50,875 --> 01:33:53,708
He's overacting like a new comedian 
who has got a break in a big budget movie.

1490
01:33:54,042 --> 01:33:55,125
They must have paid him a hefty amount!

1491
01:33:58,125 --> 01:34:00,042
-Update me every hour, Mansoor. 
-Done, sir.

1492
01:34:02,167 --> 01:34:03,750
[mobile ringing]

1493
01:34:13,500 --> 01:34:14,417
Hello?

1494
01:34:14,500 --> 01:34:15,375
Hello, hero.

1495
01:34:16,375 --> 01:34:17,500
Vishnu!

1496
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:21,708
I know you are Vishnu. 
Listen to me.

1497
01:34:23,667 --> 01:34:26,667
I am aware your wife Saheba died 
in the communal riots.

1498
01:34:28,208 --> 01:34:31,083
Identify those who are responsible 
and I will ensure they are punished

1499
01:34:31,167 --> 01:34:32,333
My dear brother!

1500
01:34:32,833 --> 01:34:35,875
You sound like those lawyers spewing 
unwanted dialogs in old Telugu melodramas.

1501
01:34:35,958 --> 01:34:37,000
Annoys me 101%.

1502
01:34:37,583 --> 01:34:39,000
Brush your overconfidence aside.

1503
01:34:39,083 --> 01:34:41,542
It was a friendly piece of advice. 
If you don't pay heed,

1504
01:34:41,625 --> 01:34:42,458
you're in danger.

1505
01:34:42,542 --> 01:34:44,417
Good lord! Really?

1506
01:34:44,917 --> 01:34:45,750
I'm petrified!

1507
01:34:46,208 --> 01:34:47,417
Stop acting.

1508
01:34:47,917 --> 01:34:50,417
This is not the army 
where you shoot people on suspicion.

1509
01:34:50,500 --> 01:34:51,542
We need evidence.

1510
01:34:51,625 --> 01:34:52,583
Damn!

1511
01:34:53,667 --> 01:34:56,167
As if you punish criminals 
when you have evidence.

1512
01:34:58,875 --> 01:35:02,167
Do you know why your police force 
needs witnesses and evidence?

1513
01:35:04,083 --> 01:35:05,458
To turn the case upside down,

1514
01:35:05,542 --> 01:35:07,708
to frame the gullible 
and save the powerful.

1515
01:35:07,833 --> 01:35:08,958
Hello, brother.

1516
01:35:09,833 --> 01:35:11,583
Mistakes are committed 
in the army too.

1517
01:35:11,833 --> 01:35:12,958
Correct.

1518
01:35:14,375 --> 01:35:16,292
In every system mistakes happen.

1519
01:35:17,208 --> 01:35:20,167
But what we do is important, my boy.

1520
01:35:21,875 --> 01:35:24,875
If there's a mistake in my system, 
I won't keep quiet even if I die.

1521
01:35:26,125 --> 01:35:29,000
Tell me how you're tackling 
the mistakes in your system?

1522
01:35:30,417 --> 01:35:31,417
Tell me?

1523
01:35:32,792 --> 01:35:34,125
What do you do?

1524
01:35:35,583 --> 01:35:37,667
-Lining your pocket with all the bribes... 
-Hey.

1525
01:35:38,083 --> 01:35:39,000
Hey!

1526
01:35:41,250 --> 01:35:42,875
Don't you dare raise your voice!

1527
01:35:43,333 --> 01:35:45,792
You are the pet dog of your bosses 
and the Home Minister.

1528
01:35:47,958 --> 01:35:50,375
If you claim you're here 
to protect justice and righteousness,

1529
01:35:50,750 --> 01:35:52,875
then I'm not your fan 
to whistle and applaud.

1530
01:35:54,750 --> 01:35:55,833
So cut the crap!

1531
01:35:56,833 --> 01:35:58,208
If you have guts,

1532
01:35:58,708 --> 01:35:59,708
try stopping me.

1533
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:01,167
Listen to me.

1534
01:36:01,250 --> 01:36:02,333
Vishnu? Vishnu?

1535
01:36:03,708 --> 01:36:04,625
Vishnu!

1536
01:36:10,542 --> 01:36:12,750
The rivalry between Sadik and Chandan

1537
01:36:12,833 --> 01:36:14,750
caused the Muharram riots 
as per our records.

1538
01:36:14,917 --> 01:36:16,292
Chandan killed Sadik.

1539
01:36:16,375 --> 01:36:17,458
I arrested Chandan.

1540
01:36:17,542 --> 01:36:20,208
So, technically, case closed.

1541
01:36:26,708 --> 01:36:28,167
But the thing is...

1542
01:36:29,500 --> 01:36:32,750
Behind those riots, 
there seems to be a bigger conspiracy.

1543
01:36:33,625 --> 01:36:36,333
And it happened without my knowledge.

1544
01:36:37,875 --> 01:36:40,792
There is a connection between 
that conspiracy and Saheba's death.

1545
01:36:42,167 --> 01:36:43,333
Also,

1546
01:36:44,625 --> 01:36:46,792
Vishnu firmly believes 
I played a part in that conspiracy.

1547
01:36:47,875 --> 01:36:49,208
He thinks I am corrupt.

1548
01:36:49,583 --> 01:36:50,750
And I hate that.

1549
01:36:52,542 --> 01:36:56,292
If I lose this, I've lost all the ideals 
I believed in when I took up this job.

1550
01:36:58,167 --> 01:36:59,750
I have to win this challenge.

1551
01:37:01,417 --> 01:37:02,375
Adithya.

1552
01:37:06,208 --> 01:37:07,667
You will win.

1553
01:37:08,333 --> 01:37:09,458
I know that.

1554
01:37:10,375 --> 01:37:12,583
[indistinct conversation]

1555
01:37:13,292 --> 01:37:14,208
[Mansoor howls]

1556
01:37:14,708 --> 01:37:18,458
"I'll be there for you always 
You'll be fine in all ways"

1557
01:37:19,125 --> 01:37:22,333
This jeweler offers security, too, 
along with quality.

1558
01:37:22,417 --> 01:37:23,333
Naughty fellow.

1559
01:37:24,458 --> 01:37:25,625
[mobile chimes]

1560
01:37:32,875 --> 01:37:33,958
[mobile ringing]

1561
01:37:35,708 --> 01:37:37,167
-What is her name? 
-Ramani, sir.

1562
01:37:38,125 --> 01:37:39,667
-She seems very familiar.-Really, sir.

1563
01:37:39,750 --> 01:37:42,333
-Anyway, get full details about her. 
-Okay, sir.

1564
01:37:42,417 --> 01:37:43,542
What is her address?

1565
01:37:51,125 --> 01:37:53,583
Hey, Santosh!

1566
01:37:53,708 --> 01:37:55,583
-Where are you off to? 
-Stop, stop!

1567
01:37:55,667 --> 01:37:56,625
We have to load it.

1568
01:37:57,375 --> 01:37:59,458
Otherwise, the checkpost 
will be barricaded.

1569
01:37:59,542 --> 01:38:02,250
Where is your Vantalakka? 
Tell her that Doctor Babu is here.

1570
01:38:02,333 --> 01:38:03,708
What is the matter?

1571
01:38:05,292 --> 01:38:07,375
Hi there, Vantalakka! Is dinner ready?

1572
01:38:07,458 --> 01:38:08,667
I hope you remember my boss.

1573
01:38:08,750 --> 01:38:11,500
We met almost a year ago.

1574
01:38:11,583 --> 01:38:13,375
#1yearofTappachabutra.

1575
01:38:13,458 --> 01:38:14,583
It's trending.

1576
01:38:14,667 --> 01:38:15,875
-Sir, sir. 
-Come, man.

1577
01:38:15,958 --> 01:38:17,667
Suresh, the notorious, please come.

1578
01:38:19,625 --> 01:38:20,583
Is it an orphanage?

1579
01:38:22,167 --> 01:38:24,042
It is more like a hostel.

1580
01:38:24,542 --> 01:38:26,792
Lodged girls 10 to 25 years of age.

1581
01:38:27,458 --> 01:38:28,833
I started five years ago

1582
01:38:29,250 --> 01:38:31,458
Name of the hostel  
 is Kalpataru Women's Home.

1583
01:38:31,542 --> 01:38:32,792
Most of them were orphans.

1584
01:38:33,708 --> 01:38:36,000
Some of them were studying  
 in schools and colleges.

1585
01:38:36,667 --> 01:38:39,042
Some did odd jobs here and there.

1586
01:38:39,542 --> 01:38:41,500
Every now and then 
some rich clients would come.

1587
01:38:41,583 --> 01:38:42,917
Seeking young girls.

1588
01:38:43,625 --> 01:38:44,708
I used to send a few.

1589
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:47,667
Some of the girls accepted submissively.

1590
01:38:48,875 --> 01:38:50,333
Some resisted the idea.

1591
01:38:50,542 --> 01:38:52,417
But I would force them to comply.

1592
01:38:56,917 --> 01:38:59,542
Inspector Prasad helped 
with our business willingly.

1593
01:38:59,625 --> 01:39:01,042
How did you know Prasad?

1594
01:39:02,583 --> 01:39:04,000
We met in a function.

1595
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:06,958
I was going through rough weather then.

1596
01:39:07,500 --> 01:39:09,167
He helped me a lot.

1597
01:39:10,125 --> 01:39:12,667
He asked me to live with him.

1598
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:14,500
He took real good care of me.

1599
01:39:14,583 --> 01:39:17,042
But one day one of the girls ran away.

1600
01:39:17,417 --> 01:39:18,417
Her name was Ayesha.

1601
01:39:18,708 --> 01:39:20,458
She didn't run away empty-handed.

1602
01:39:22,292 --> 01:39:23,458
[girl screaming]

1603
01:39:25,625 --> 01:39:28,000
That night, her best friend Kalyani

1604
01:39:28,333 --> 01:39:30,208
was raped by three men.

1605
01:39:30,292 --> 01:39:31,333
[Kalyani screaming]

1606
01:39:31,500 --> 01:39:33,833
Ayesha captured everything on video, sir.

1607
01:39:44,375 --> 01:39:47,375
She escaped from the hostel  
 with that incriminating piece of evidence.

1608
01:39:47,458 --> 01:39:49,292
Prasad later told me

1609
01:39:49,500 --> 01:39:51,875
that Ayesha met Sadik Hassan.

1610
01:39:53,625 --> 01:39:56,000
Notorious rowdy in Tappachabutra.

1611
01:39:56,542 --> 01:40:00,417
I believe he was known  
 for helping orphans and the needy.

1612
01:40:00,500 --> 01:40:03,708
Apparently, some political bigwigs  
 and police officials...

1613
01:40:03,875 --> 01:40:06,208
-What is it, dear?-...hated him it seems, sir.

1614
01:40:06,292 --> 01:40:08,500
Ayesha took that video to him.

1615
01:40:09,083 --> 01:40:11,292
Sadik gave protection to Ayesha

1616
01:40:11,375 --> 01:40:13,333
and promised to help her, sir.

1617
01:40:15,250 --> 01:40:17,000
But what happened was totally unexpected.

1618
01:40:19,542 --> 01:40:22,292
The offender in that video 
was Home Minister's son Ranjith.

1619
01:40:22,542 --> 01:40:25,292
After watching it,  
 Sadik changed his tune.

1620
01:40:25,375 --> 01:40:27,833
He got the rare chance  
 to wring the golden goose's neck!

1621
01:40:31,167 --> 01:40:32,125
And then...

1622
01:40:34,500 --> 01:40:36,667
Sadik got in touch with the Home minister.

1623
01:40:36,708 --> 01:40:38,333
In the suburbs of Hyderabad,

1624
01:40:38,417 --> 01:40:42,125
government project worth 500 billion  
 was planned in the outskirts of the city.

1625
01:40:42,583 --> 01:40:45,875
He demanded a 25% share  
 in that project, sir.

1626
01:40:45,958 --> 01:40:48,917
He threatened to upload  
 the video on social media

1627
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:51,625
and all the TV channels  
 if his demand wasn't met.

1628
01:40:52,375 --> 01:40:55,875
Ranjith instructed his father 
to bargain with Sadik,

1629
01:40:55,958 --> 01:40:58,792
but actually he had hatched 
a different plan to kill Sadik.

1630
01:40:59,417 --> 01:41:02,333
Knowing it is risky to kill Sadik 
one-on-one before the elections,

1631
01:41:02,417 --> 01:41:06,875
they planned a riot on Muharram  
 and to kill Sadik in that mayhem.

1632
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:14,833
A local gang  
 and another from out of town

1633
01:41:14,917 --> 01:41:16,542
were paid to participate.  
[group chanting]

1634
01:41:17,667 --> 01:41:19,917
The local gang was led by Chandan Kumar.

1635
01:41:21,500 --> 01:41:23,167
The out of towners...

1636
01:41:23,250 --> 01:41:25,375
It was led by KK, a Mumbai gangster.

1637
01:41:27,083 --> 01:41:28,708
Everything fell into place 
as per their plan, sir.

1638
01:41:28,792 --> 01:41:31,250
[glass shattering] 
[commotion]

1639
01:42:21,083 --> 01:42:23,042
Hey, you! Stop!

1640
01:42:41,583 --> 01:42:43,583
Prasad saw Ayesha by chance.

1641
01:42:44,583 --> 01:42:46,333
[siren wailing]

1642
01:42:55,333 --> 01:42:57,292
You came there at the same time.

1643
01:42:57,375 --> 01:42:58,875
Prasad noted your arrival.

1644
01:42:58,958 --> 01:43:02,250
He called me and asked me 
to divert you towards Chandan.

1645
01:43:02,958 --> 01:43:04,667
They are coming to kill us!

1646
01:43:04,750 --> 01:43:06,500
Hurry up, sir. 
They will kill them.

1647
01:43:06,583 --> 01:43:08,417
-You handle this. 
-Hurry up, sir.

1648
01:43:11,625 --> 01:43:12,833
After that,

1649
01:43:13,292 --> 01:43:14,792
they got hold of Ayesha.

1650
01:43:16,792 --> 01:43:17,833
And killed her ruthlessly.

1651
01:43:19,208 --> 01:43:20,708
[sobbing]

1652
01:43:24,833 --> 01:43:26,250
In the riot that day,

1653
01:43:27,667 --> 01:43:29,000
did you see this woman anywhere?

1654
01:43:30,875 --> 01:43:31,917
Her name is Saheba.

1655
01:43:33,583 --> 01:43:34,500
No, sir.

1656
01:43:34,583 --> 01:43:38,167
Who else was with Ranjith 
in that video recorded by Ayesha?

1657
01:43:38,500 --> 01:43:39,583
Builder Mallikarjun...

1658
01:43:39,625 --> 01:43:40,625
Relax!

1659
01:43:42,125 --> 01:43:43,708
...JC Jewelers chairman,

1660
01:43:43,792 --> 01:43:45,000
-Sharath Chandra.  
 -Don't worry.

1661
01:43:46,583 --> 01:43:49,042
Sharath Chandra, JC Jewelers.

1662
01:43:49,250 --> 01:43:50,500
Our KC Jewelers

1663
01:43:50,583 --> 01:43:52,292
is a sister company of JC Jewelers, sir.

1664
01:43:55,042 --> 01:43:56,000
Prasad,

1665
01:43:57,250 --> 01:43:58,167
Mallik,

1666
01:43:59,792 --> 01:44:00,792
KK.

1667
01:44:02,542 --> 01:44:05,917
If Vishnu has already killed three people, 
remaining are...

1668
01:44:06,167 --> 01:44:07,667
Sharath and Ranjith.

1669
01:44:07,750 --> 01:44:09,917
Only these two can share 
details about Saheba.

1670
01:44:11,792 --> 01:44:13,208
Vishnu's clue was "Golden boy."

1671
01:44:13,292 --> 01:44:15,375
It means his next target 
has to be Sharath.

1672
01:44:15,875 --> 01:44:17,958
-We must reach Sharath immediately. 
-Okay, sir.

1673
01:44:18,042 --> 01:44:19,292
Do you have his contact details?

1674
01:44:20,125 --> 01:44:22,083
So what did you say your name was?

1675
01:44:22,625 --> 01:44:23,583
Catherine. 
[footsteps approaching]

1676
01:44:23,667 --> 01:44:25,208
Catherine. Right, right, right.

1677
01:44:25,917 --> 01:44:27,750
Nice, I like the name.

1678
01:44:34,250 --> 01:44:36,292
Hey! Five minutes.

1679
01:44:38,042 --> 01:44:39,000
Bloody cops!

1680
01:44:40,583 --> 01:44:42,083
It's okay. This is normal.

1681
01:44:42,625 --> 01:44:44,417
He is still standing there. Look.

1682
01:44:45,958 --> 01:44:47,750
Hey! Didn't I say five minutes?

1683
01:44:47,833 --> 01:44:48,667
Get lost!

1684
01:44:50,333 --> 01:44:51,917
Bloody idiot!

1685
01:44:53,958 --> 01:44:54,958
Stupid cop!

1686
01:44:55,042 --> 01:44:56,833
-Hey, Sharath, easy. 
-I'll just be back.

1687
01:44:57,667 --> 01:44:59,958
Hey! Are you deaf or what?

1688
01:45:00,042 --> 01:45:01,958
Do you know whom you are talking to?

1689
01:45:02,042 --> 01:45:04,458
Hey, don't you understand?

1690
01:45:05,583 --> 01:45:06,833
I'm talking to you. Don't you...

1691
01:45:13,333 --> 01:45:14,417
Your phone...

1692
01:45:16,750 --> 01:45:18,292
leave it there and go.

1693
01:45:32,583 --> 01:45:34,667
Sharath's phone is switched off. 
I tried his manager's.

1694
01:45:34,750 --> 01:45:36,958
Sharath was meeting a friend 
but he doesn't know who.

1695
01:45:37,042 --> 01:45:39,417
Pick up the manager, 
let's go to Sharath's house.

1696
01:45:48,458 --> 01:45:49,708
[muffled groaning]

1697
01:46:10,875 --> 01:46:12,292
Who are you?

1698
01:46:13,333 --> 01:46:14,750
What do you want?

1699
01:46:16,458 --> 01:46:17,542
Money?

1700
01:46:17,625 --> 01:46:19,333
Name your price.

1701
01:46:19,417 --> 01:46:20,333
Tell me.

1702
01:46:20,458 --> 01:46:21,458
How much do you want?

1703
01:46:21,542 --> 01:46:22,708
No, no, no.

1704
01:46:23,125 --> 01:46:24,167
Why do I need money?

1705
01:46:24,833 --> 01:46:25,875
I need an answer.

1706
01:46:28,125 --> 01:46:29,167
I need your answer

1707
01:46:29,875 --> 01:46:30,875
to my question.

1708
01:46:32,500 --> 01:46:33,583
Answer?

1709
01:46:34,125 --> 01:46:35,125
For what?

1710
01:46:36,125 --> 01:46:37,250
I don't understand.

1711
01:46:39,333 --> 01:46:41,083
So, Mr. Sharath,

1712
01:46:41,583 --> 01:46:43,167
let me present you

1713
01:46:43,750 --> 01:46:46,542
your first and final question.

1714
01:46:49,333 --> 01:46:51,583
Valyrian, the popular Roman emperor,

1715
01:46:51,667 --> 01:46:56,167
the cruel Spanish knight Valdivia, 
who lived in the second century,

1716
01:46:56,250 --> 01:46:58,458
the recent Game of Thrones...

1717
01:46:58,625 --> 01:46:59,750
You watch it, right?

1718
01:47:00,208 --> 01:47:01,042
Yes.

1719
01:47:01,125 --> 01:47:02,125
Good.

1720
01:47:02,542 --> 01:47:04,250
There is a character in that series,

1721
01:47:04,333 --> 01:47:05,667
Viserys Targaryen.

1722
01:47:05,750 --> 01:47:08,708
Do you know the only common factor 
between these three?

1723
01:47:10,208 --> 01:47:11,625
Your time...

1724
01:47:13,708 --> 01:47:15,625
unfortunately started long back!

1725
01:47:24,500 --> 01:47:26,250
Are you Mr. Sharath Chandra's wife?

1726
01:47:26,917 --> 01:47:27,958
Yes.

1727
01:47:28,250 --> 01:47:29,250
Can we come in?

1728
01:47:29,375 --> 01:47:31,250
-Who are you? 
-Police.

1729
01:47:31,708 --> 01:47:33,292
[beeping]

1730
01:47:47,583 --> 01:47:48,583
What is this?

1731
01:47:50,708 --> 01:47:51,792
What are you doing?

1732
01:47:51,875 --> 01:47:56,917
Home minister's son Ranjith and Sharath 
have been friends since childhood.

1733
01:47:57,250 --> 01:47:59,833
But I have no clue 
about the women's hostel you mentioned.

1734
01:47:59,917 --> 01:48:02,333
And I don't understand 
what you are saying.

1735
01:48:03,083 --> 01:48:04,458
Please listen to me.

1736
01:48:04,792 --> 01:48:05,875
What is all this for?

1737
01:48:06,250 --> 01:48:07,250
Please.

1738
01:48:15,667 --> 01:48:17,417
You are making me angry.

1739
01:48:26,875 --> 01:48:28,500
Now, for the final

1740
01:48:28,917 --> 01:48:30,375
and bumper prize!

1741
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:32,083
Please answer.

1742
01:48:36,083 --> 01:48:38,292
I am so excited!

1743
01:48:59,333 --> 01:49:00,583
So the answer is...

1744
01:49:05,375 --> 01:49:07,000
The three characters 
I had mentioned,

1745
01:49:07,708 --> 01:49:10,417
they were forced to drink 
molten gold and killed!

1746
01:49:13,958 --> 01:49:17,417
Now you are about to join 
that list of rare celebrities.

1747
01:49:18,792 --> 01:49:20,292
Congratulations!

1748
01:49:36,333 --> 01:49:38,500
[mobile vibrating]

1749
01:49:39,333 --> 01:49:40,708
Ravi, tell me.

1750
01:49:44,833 --> 01:49:47,292
TS 10 EJ 0001, 
is that your husband's car?

1751
01:49:47,667 --> 01:49:48,625
Yes, sir.

1752
01:49:50,042 --> 01:49:51,458
[siren wailing]

1753
01:49:54,417 --> 01:49:56,792
Sir! 
[indistinct chatter]

1754
01:49:56,875 --> 01:49:58,125
Hey, go back!

1755
01:49:59,667 --> 01:50:01,458
Sir, sir. Mr. Adithya. Sir?

1756
01:50:12,458 --> 01:50:14,917
"Only the whale remains."

1757
01:50:20,792 --> 01:50:21,958
Sir, Mr. Adithya.

1758
01:50:22,167 --> 01:50:24,417
Waiting for your comment. 
Don't walk away like that.

1759
01:50:24,500 --> 01:50:25,583
Get lost!

1760
01:50:32,625 --> 01:50:34,458
Sir, Vishnu's wife Saheba died

1761
01:50:34,542 --> 01:50:36,708
in the Muharram riots.

1762
01:50:38,250 --> 01:50:39,583
We don't know

1763
01:50:40,458 --> 01:50:41,500
why and how.

1764
01:50:42,500 --> 01:50:46,000
Vishnu has already killed four men 
who was responsible for the riots.

1765
01:50:47,958 --> 01:50:49,417
The latest clue left by the murderer,

1766
01:50:49,708 --> 01:50:51,250
"Only the whale remains."

1767
01:50:52,333 --> 01:50:53,708
Going by the killer's surmise,

1768
01:50:53,792 --> 01:50:56,000
Ranjith is the final big target.

1769
01:50:56,958 --> 01:50:57,875
The description fits him.

1770
01:51:01,792 --> 01:51:05,375
Ranjith is celebrating his birthday 
on a private island.

1771
01:51:06,583 --> 01:51:10,292
So the assassin is clearly saying 
he intends hunting the whale in the sea.

1772
01:51:15,708 --> 01:51:19,125
Ranjith has private mercenaries 
employed to protect him,

1773
01:51:19,833 --> 01:51:21,208
but trust me, sir,

1774
01:51:21,292 --> 01:51:22,417
they cannot stop Vishnu.

1775
01:51:23,042 --> 01:51:25,625
Vishnu is an expert  
 in anti-terrorist operations, sir.

1776
01:51:25,917 --> 01:51:27,083
He is too good for them.

1777
01:51:27,625 --> 01:51:30,708
The only witness we have to prove 
the conspiracy behind the riots is...

1778
01:51:30,792 --> 01:51:31,833
Ranjith.

1779
01:51:32,708 --> 01:51:34,917
If someone wipes him out 
because of personal enmity,

1780
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:36,667
the entire conspiracy will get buried.

1781
01:51:36,875 --> 01:51:38,042
Truth will never come out.

1782
01:51:38,625 --> 01:51:39,708
As you fear,

1783
01:51:40,417 --> 01:51:42,250
if he has already left the country,

1784
01:51:42,333 --> 01:51:43,417
what are our options?

1785
01:51:43,958 --> 01:51:45,750
A special team under my command.

1786
01:51:46,292 --> 01:51:48,167
We have to conduct 
an undercover operation in Thailand.

1787
01:51:51,417 --> 01:51:52,417
Please, sir.

1788
01:51:52,500 --> 01:51:53,458
Grant me permission.

1789
01:51:53,667 --> 01:51:54,958
I don't think it's a good idea, sir.

1790
01:51:55,542 --> 01:51:58,500
With the testimony from Chandan, 
Ramani and Suresh, we can arrest Ranjith.

1791
01:51:58,792 --> 01:52:00,375
If you do that, 
Ranjith won't come to India.

1792
01:52:00,667 --> 01:52:01,750
Somehow he will escape.

1793
01:52:03,042 --> 01:52:05,458
Sir, undercover operation 
is our only option.

1794
01:52:05,542 --> 01:52:06,500
Sir, that seems...

1795
01:52:10,750 --> 01:52:11,708
I agree with Adithya.

1796
01:52:12,375 --> 01:52:13,667
I think it's a good idea.

1797
01:52:14,667 --> 01:52:17,000
After all, it's a matter 
of our department's reputation.

1798
01:52:17,333 --> 01:52:19,042
Let us see how much of a hero he is!

1799
01:52:19,417 --> 01:52:21,708
I want us to outnumber and outsmart him,

1800
01:52:21,750 --> 01:52:23,792
and kill him like a bloody mongrel.

1801
01:52:25,667 --> 01:52:26,542
Thank you, sir.

1802
01:53:01,250 --> 01:53:04,833
"Sigh and sough of the evening breeze 
All of a sudden simmers to tease"

1803
01:53:04,917 --> 01:53:08,125

All of a sudden simmers to tease"

1804

"Fizz, froth, flow on the beach 
A beer for all, within hands' reach"

1805
01:53:11,625 --> 01:53:15,125
"Fizz, froth, flow on the beach 
A beer for all, within hands' reach"

1806
01:53:15,417 --> 01:53:18,875

Let the fun begin topsy-turvy"

Intoxication swell"

In kaleidoscopic hues"

"Let us fix a ladder that high 
To touch the clouds in the sky"

1810
01:53:29,542 --> 01:53:33,000
"Live life to the fullest 
Overflowing with zeal and zest"

1811
01:53:33,083 --> 01:53:36,125
"Let us have a blast heavenly 
Go bonkers, on a wild, wild spree"

1812
01:53:36,208 --> 01:53:39,500
"Oh, my God, isn't this ultimate?"

1813
01:53:39,583 --> 01:53:42,958
"Paint the town red and celebrate"

1814
01:53:43,042 --> 01:53:46,333
"Oh, my God, isn't sky the limit?"

1815
01:53:46,417 --> 01:53:49,417
"Kick up our heels, live it"

1816
01:53:49,500 --> 01:53:50,917
"Shakalaka boom boom!"

1817
01:54:04,792 --> 01:54:08,000
"Body-body, fun kabaddi"

1818
01:54:08,375 --> 01:54:11,500
"Touching, touching, 
Shall we begin?"

1819
01:54:11,792 --> 01:54:15,292
"Let us rejoice and revel 
Like merry minx, raise hell"

1820
01:54:15,375 --> 01:54:18,917
"Warm up the climate 
With our games inappropriate"

1821
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:24,000
"Celebration on fire 
To deepen flames of desire"

1822
01:54:24,083 --> 01:54:27,583
"Let us cross the line of control"

1823
01:54:27,667 --> 01:54:31,000
"Tease and please, body to soul"

1824
01:54:33,125 --> 01:54:36,625

"Shakalaka boom boom!"

[gunshots] 
[all screaming]

1841
01:56:34,875 --> 01:56:36,125
Go, go, go. Go.

1842
01:56:36,208 --> 01:56:38,042
You go this side. Keep moving.

1843
01:56:51,750 --> 01:56:53,167
Ranjith, this way.

1844
01:56:53,750 --> 01:56:55,292
Go, man, go! I said, go!

1845
01:57:23,208 --> 01:57:24,042
[whistles]

1846
01:58:22,750 --> 01:58:25,542

[groaning]

1850
01:59:50,333 --> 01:59:51,833
How do we finish this?

1851
01:59:53,333 --> 01:59:57,458
No one should say it did not 
match up to their expectations

1852
02:00:11,250 --> 02:00:12,500
My God!

1853
02:00:33,167 --> 02:00:35,208
WE WILL MEET AGAIN!

1854
02:01:29,708 --> 02:01:30,750
Good morning

1855
02:01:31,875 --> 02:01:33,625
The man who challenged me

1856
02:01:35,125 --> 02:01:36,125
has killed five people.

1857
02:01:37,542 --> 02:01:38,833
I couldn't do anything.

1858
02:01:41,417 --> 02:01:43,042
As a mark of my five failures,

1859
02:01:43,750 --> 02:01:45,000
I have to...

1860
02:01:46,125 --> 02:01:48,042
Along with the medal for gallantry,

1861
02:01:48,500 --> 02:01:51,167
I surrender all the medals 
conferred on me.

1862
02:01:53,458 --> 02:01:55,583
I accept I am unfit  
 to be a police officer.

1863
02:01:57,958 --> 02:01:59,083
I...accept defeat.

1864
02:02:02,208 --> 02:02:04,000
I am also submitting my resignation.

1865
02:02:07,875 --> 02:02:08,708
Bye.

1866
02:02:08,792 --> 02:02:09,708
Thank you.

1867
02:02:27,708 --> 02:02:29,167
Adi? Adi?

1868
02:02:29,917 --> 02:02:31,500
News, come, come.

1869
02:02:31,792 --> 02:02:34,167
The sensational serial killer case solved.

1870
02:02:34,250 --> 02:02:37,125
The murder of Ranjith,  
 son of Home Minister Swamy

1871
02:02:37,208 --> 02:02:41,583
along with four other victims last month  
 by Vamsi has shaken the entire State.

1872
02:02:41,875 --> 02:02:44,875
Vamsi was killed in a police encounter  
 last night in Hyderabad.

1873
02:02:44,958 --> 02:02:47,708
The operation was led by DCP Sathya.

1874
02:02:47,833 --> 02:02:51,208
This is the same murderer who had  
 challenged DCP Adithya last month.

1875
02:02:51,292 --> 02:02:54,375
After Mr. Adithya's failure  
 and subsequent resignation,

1876
02:02:54,458 --> 02:02:57,292
a new team was formed  
 and with the aid of new techniques

1877
02:02:57,375 --> 02:02:59,917
we nabbed the culprit  
 and killed him in an encounter.

1878
02:03:00,042 --> 02:03:03,792
The police hemmed in, based on a tip-off,  
 the lodge where the culprit was hiding.

1879
02:03:03,875 --> 02:03:06,750
When the murderer got wind of this,  
 he opened fire at the police officers.

1880
02:03:06,833 --> 02:03:10,208
In the ensuing encounter, the murderer was  
 shot dead in self-defense by the police.

1881
02:03:10,292 --> 02:03:14,417
Revolver, diary, sim cards were retrieved  
 from the crime scene by the cops.

1882
02:03:16,458 --> 02:03:18,917
-Hello. 
-Do you believe this news on TV?

1883
02:03:24,708 --> 02:03:25,750
Vishnu?

1884
02:03:25,833 --> 02:03:27,333
They have even changed my name.

1885
02:03:28,167 --> 02:03:29,292
Vamsi!

1886
02:03:30,958 --> 02:03:33,583
The police cleverly picked on 
a pickpocket to save their dignity

1887
02:03:33,667 --> 02:03:35,083
and claiming it's me.

1888
02:03:36,542 --> 02:03:37,417
Where are you?

1889
02:03:38,667 --> 02:03:40,250
Wherever you saw me last...

1890
02:03:42,042 --> 02:03:43,125
same place.

1891
02:03:43,750 --> 02:03:44,792
Shall we meet just once?

1892
02:03:47,625 --> 02:03:49,417
When you shifted the victim's head,

1893
02:03:49,500 --> 02:03:51,417
didn't you read the note 
pinned onto his head?

1894
02:03:51,500 --> 02:03:53,167
I'll call you as soon as I land.

1895
02:03:53,958 --> 02:03:55,667
Let us decide on the meeting place.

1896
02:04:11,833 --> 02:04:12,917
Thank you.

1897
02:04:59,792 --> 02:05:01,375
-Cappuccino? 
-Tea.

1898
02:05:02,500 --> 02:05:03,500
Can I get a cup of tea?

1899
02:05:04,875 --> 02:05:06,125
One Num-Chai.

1900
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:09,750
You were scrawny in school.

1901
02:05:12,292 --> 02:05:13,958
I got stronger to keep pace with you.

1902
02:05:19,833 --> 02:05:21,417
I'll ask you a question,

1903
02:05:22,625 --> 02:05:23,667
will you answer me?

1904
02:05:28,375 --> 02:05:30,208
On the island,

1905
02:05:31,083 --> 02:05:32,167
did you expect so many opponents?

1906
02:05:32,750 --> 02:05:34,833
If I should answer this man-to-man,

1907
02:05:35,625 --> 02:05:36,917
I was lucky.

1908
02:05:37,958 --> 02:05:40,167
Your team's inefficiency 
worked in my favor.

1909
02:05:52,208 --> 02:05:53,250
[sighing]

1910
02:05:54,042 --> 02:05:55,083
Just rewind a little bit.

1911
02:05:56,958 --> 02:05:59,833
Let's just run through 
the highlights with my commentary.

1912
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:02,833
When you started your attack,

1913
02:06:02,917 --> 02:06:04,875
I started eliminating Ranjith's men.

1914
02:06:11,375 --> 02:06:13,125
But that wasn't the main problem.

1915
02:06:13,375 --> 02:06:14,583
The truth is,

1916
02:06:14,667 --> 02:06:16,667
Mansoor found out that  
 the Home Minister and DGP planted moles

1917
02:06:16,750 --> 02:06:19,333
in the special team.

1918
02:06:19,500 --> 02:06:21,583
Their aim was not to assist me,

1919
02:06:21,667 --> 02:06:23,375
but to kill both of us.

1920
02:06:25,500 --> 02:06:26,667
That's why I took it upon myself.

1921
02:06:32,167 --> 02:06:34,333
I eliminated them one-by-one.

1922
02:06:34,417 --> 02:06:36,167
And cleared the route for you.

1923
02:06:36,250 --> 02:06:38,542
Gradually, I isolated Ranjith.

1924
02:06:39,375 --> 02:06:40,958
After you killed him,

1925
02:06:41,042 --> 02:06:43,208
to ward off any suspicion  
 from the team

1926
02:06:43,333 --> 02:06:45,125
I acted as if I was frustrated.

1927
02:06:55,792 --> 02:06:57,000
You can't believe me, right?

1928
02:07:02,042 --> 02:07:03,375
I want to believe you.

1929
02:07:04,542 --> 02:07:06,000
But I am unable to.

1930
02:07:09,292 --> 02:07:10,167
What's in it for you?

1931
02:07:10,500 --> 02:07:13,542
Medals, prestige and popularity.

1932
02:07:15,167 --> 02:07:16,167
They don't mean a thing.

1933
02:07:18,167 --> 02:07:19,875
Five vile creatures are dead.

1934
02:07:19,958 --> 02:07:22,208
So many innocent women 
have been saved from that terrible fate.

1935
02:07:24,583 --> 02:07:26,000
That's enough for me.

1936
02:07:27,667 --> 02:07:28,708
I am happy.

1937
02:07:29,542 --> 02:07:31,500
But I am still in the dark 
about something.

1938
02:07:34,125 --> 02:07:36,458
How did Saheba die in that riot?

1939
02:07:38,417 --> 02:07:41,375
How are these five thugs 
responsible for her death?

1940
02:07:43,375 --> 02:07:45,917
This is the only missing piece 
in the jigsaw puzzle for me.

1941
02:07:50,958 --> 02:07:52,833
After I fell down the ravine in Kashmir,

1942
02:07:54,208 --> 02:07:56,958
I was swept by the river  
 onto the banks of a village.

1943
02:07:57,625 --> 02:07:59,458
I got caught in the jaws of death.

1944
02:07:59,708 --> 02:08:01,750
Some kind villagers carried me to safety,

1945
02:08:01,833 --> 02:08:03,667
treated me and saved my life.

1946
02:08:04,083 --> 02:08:06,750
I urged them not to tell anyone  
 about my whereabouts.

1947
02:08:07,542 --> 02:08:09,417
I was in that village for ten days.

1948
02:08:09,500 --> 02:08:12,000
I was presumed dead 
by my unit anyway.

1949
02:08:12,458 --> 02:08:14,458
So I thought of spending 
some time with Saheba,

1950
02:08:14,542 --> 02:08:16,458
and then report back to duty.

1951
02:08:17,958 --> 02:08:20,250
The villagers who rescued me  
 got me a phone.

1952
02:08:21,042 --> 02:08:24,250
I tried to call Saheba from that mobile.

1953
02:08:24,500 --> 02:08:27,917
But though I tried repeatedly,  
 her phone was switched off.

1954
02:08:29,917 --> 02:08:32,375
Generally, Saheba used to email me.

1955
02:08:33,458 --> 02:08:35,083
I thought I'll check it once.

1956
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:38,583
I logged into my account.

1957
02:08:41,958 --> 02:08:43,667
Only then I knew what had happened.

1958
02:08:43,750 --> 02:08:46,542
Before Inspector Prasad died,

1959
02:08:46,792 --> 02:08:48,833
he confessed everything to me.

1960
02:08:49,083 --> 02:08:50,708
On the day of the riots,

1961
02:08:50,792 --> 02:08:53,708
Saheba was in the washroom  
 of KC Jewelers.

1962
02:08:54,167 --> 02:08:55,750
She couldn't escape.

1963
02:08:56,958 --> 02:08:58,042
[groaning]

1964
02:09:00,583 --> 02:09:04,375
Scared for her safety, she rushed back  
 into the washroom and locked herself in.

1965
02:09:04,458 --> 02:09:07,625
At that same time,  
 Ayesha also came over there.

1966
02:09:10,083 --> 02:09:12,833
Prasad saw Ayesha  
 go into KC Jewelers.

1967
02:09:13,125 --> 02:09:14,583
He signaled to KK.

1968
02:09:32,250 --> 02:09:33,083
Vishnu.

1969
02:09:37,208 --> 02:09:39,500
By the time you get this video,

1970
02:09:41,250 --> 02:09:43,042
I don't know if I will be dead or alive.

1971
02:09:44,958 --> 02:09:47,625
This girl showed me a video.

1972
02:09:47,917 --> 02:09:49,083
I am sending it to you.

1973
02:09:51,333 --> 02:09:54,833
My heart broke to pieces 
watching this, Vishnu.

1974
02:10:02,792 --> 02:10:05,417
Names of those you see in this video,

1975
02:10:05,958 --> 02:10:08,292
Home Minister Swamy's son Ranjith,

1976
02:10:08,792 --> 02:10:11,333
real estate dealer Mallikarjun,

1977
02:10:11,833 --> 02:10:14,333
JC Jewelers chairman Sharath Chandra.

1978
02:10:15,125 --> 02:10:16,750
They committed this heinous crime.

1979
02:10:18,250 --> 02:10:20,458
Inspector Prasad

1980
02:10:21,292 --> 02:10:26,042
and so many senior police officers 
are involved in this, Vishnu.

1981
02:10:31,667 --> 02:10:35,708
This riot is planned 
specifically to kill Sadik Hassan.

1982
02:10:36,042 --> 02:10:38,375
To destroy the evidence in his possession.

1983
02:10:40,958 --> 02:10:44,792
That means, killing this little girl, too.

1984
02:10:47,042 --> 02:10:50,458
I will try my best to save this girl.

1985
02:10:52,667 --> 02:10:53,875
But if I am...

1986
02:10:58,917 --> 02:11:01,125
But if I am unable to...

1987
02:11:02,417 --> 02:11:05,583
you should not spare them.

1988
02:11:07,375 --> 02:11:08,625
Don't spare them, Vishnu.

1989
02:11:10,208 --> 02:11:11,708
Promise me you won't spare them at all.

1990
02:11:13,042 --> 02:11:14,292
Please.

1991
02:11:14,583 --> 02:11:15,667
[banging on door]

1992
02:11:20,958 --> 02:11:21,958
I love you.

1993
02:11:24,083 --> 02:11:24,958
Bye.

1994
02:11:26,542 --> 02:11:27,583
I love you.

1995
02:11:32,292 --> 02:11:33,208
[toilet flushing]

1996
02:11:37,583 --> 02:11:38,875
Sister.

1997
02:11:41,542 --> 02:11:43,750
She threw the mobile into 
the commode. Get it.

1998
02:11:44,208 --> 02:11:45,875
Let go of us.

1999
02:11:46,375 --> 02:11:48,667
Please, please!

2000
02:11:49,125 --> 02:11:50,458
Please!

2001
02:12:01,042 --> 02:12:02,500
Spare us.

2002
02:12:06,125 --> 02:12:07,083
Please.

2003
02:12:09,917 --> 02:12:11,333
Please.

2004
02:12:14,125 --> 02:12:15,000
Sister?

2005
02:12:27,333 --> 02:12:28,583
Vishnu.

2006
02:13:11,708 --> 02:13:14,000
In case they destroy her phone,

2007
02:13:14,583 --> 02:13:15,917
she emailed it to me.

2008
02:13:17,917 --> 02:13:19,125
She's so smart.

2009
02:13:20,083 --> 02:13:20,958
Right?

2010
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:23,083
You're right.

2011
02:13:23,500 --> 02:13:24,542
She's smart.

2012
02:13:29,667 --> 02:13:32,208
I decided what I'm going to do 
the second I watched that video.

2013
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:35,250
But then I found out...

2014
02:13:37,083 --> 02:13:40,500
You were lauded as a hero 
for saving 30 lives in that riot

2015
02:13:40,583 --> 02:13:43,000
The fact they wanted to confer 
a medal on you for gallantry

2016
02:13:43,417 --> 02:13:44,750
made my blood boil!

2017
02:13:46,167 --> 02:13:48,542
I thought you were peas 
in the same corrupt pod!

2018
02:13:48,917 --> 02:13:52,000
I concluded your heroism was also 
part of the plan, a mere show.

2019
02:13:54,917 --> 02:13:56,458
That's why for nine long months

2020
02:13:56,542 --> 02:13:59,792
I plotted a foolproof plan 
to nail those bastards.

2021
02:14:03,167 --> 02:14:06,167
I chose the day you got your medal 
to start my mission by killing Prasad.

2022
02:14:06,250 --> 02:14:07,792
I declared war on you.

2023
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:11,375
I wanted to make a fool out of you.

2024
02:14:13,458 --> 02:14:16,125
I knew your police top-dogs would spin 
a fake encounter to save face

2025
02:14:16,333 --> 02:14:19,000
and claim to have killed me. 
I guessed this right in the beginning.

2026
02:14:20,292 --> 02:14:22,458
I thought if I released the video then,

2027
02:14:22,667 --> 02:14:24,542
it would be a real punch.

2028
02:14:27,958 --> 02:14:29,042
But you surprised me.

2029
02:14:35,083 --> 02:14:36,083
Here.

2030
02:14:36,125 --> 02:14:37,042
No, Adithya.

2031
02:14:38,875 --> 02:14:39,750
This is for you.

2032
02:14:42,208 --> 02:14:43,917
Show this to the world.

2033
02:14:45,375 --> 02:14:48,792
Dignity and integrity of men like you 
should not be sacrificed

2034
02:14:48,875 --> 02:14:50,208
to pander to such beasts.

2035
02:14:52,208 --> 02:14:53,417
You have won.

2036
02:14:55,208 --> 02:14:56,500
No, Vishnu.

2037
02:14:57,708 --> 02:14:58,583
You made me win!

2038
02:15:01,417 --> 02:15:02,708
This is the...

2039
02:15:04,125 --> 02:15:05,042
best medal I've got.

2040
02:15:08,917 --> 02:15:09,750
Thank you.

2041
02:15:16,500 --> 02:15:17,500
Well, then!

2042
02:15:17,875 --> 02:15:18,708
See you next time.

2043
02:15:20,542 --> 02:15:21,833
Is there a next time?

2044
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:24,958
You never know.

2045
02:15:27,667 --> 02:15:28,625
Good luck.

2046
02:15:46,625 --> 02:15:48,042
Good morning, everyone.

2047
02:15:48,333 --> 02:15:51,208
Thank you one and all 
for coming here at such short notice.

2048
02:15:51,667 --> 02:15:52,792
Mr. Shankar,

2049
02:15:54,333 --> 02:15:55,625
this is my gift to you.

2050
02:15:55,708 --> 02:15:56,833
Play it.

2051
02:16:00,208 --> 02:16:03,000
The link between last year's riots  
 in Tappachabutra

2052
02:16:03,083 --> 02:16:05,000
and the series of murders  
 that shook our state last month,

2053
02:16:05,542 --> 02:16:06,750
you are about to watch it.

2054
02:16:07,917 --> 02:16:10,833
After viewing it,  
 to discern what is just and unjust

2055
02:16:11,417 --> 02:16:12,708
is entirely up to you.

2056
02:16:21,833 --> 02:16:22,958
-Here. 
-Thank you.

2057
02:16:26,167 --> 02:16:27,000
Surprise!

2058
02:16:28,500 --> 02:16:29,458
Wow!

2059
02:16:29,542 --> 02:16:31,083
-When? 
-Yesterday.

2060
02:16:31,500 --> 02:16:32,667
I hid it to surprise you.

2061
02:16:34,500 --> 02:16:35,792
That's wonderful.

2062
02:16:37,458 --> 02:16:38,583
Isn't it funny?

2063
02:16:39,708 --> 02:16:41,417
You wanted to write a story about me, 
but you wrote something totally different.

2064
02:16:43,458 --> 02:16:44,583
Isn't this your story, too?

2065
02:16:48,708 --> 02:16:50,292
-Did you send a copy to Vishnu? 
-Yes.

2066
02:16:54,667 --> 02:16:57,000
SAHEBA
