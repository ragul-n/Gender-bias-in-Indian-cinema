1
00:02:25,042 --> 00:02:25,958
Hello.

2
00:02:25,958 --> 00:02:26,958
Good morning.

3
00:02:26,958 --> 00:02:28,208
Morning.

4
00:02:28,292 --> 00:02:29,458
This is Sam.

5
00:02:29,542 --> 00:02:33,167
Couldn't reach your mobile phone.

6
00:02:33,417 --> 00:02:34,625
Sam?

7
00:02:35,625 --> 00:02:38,042
Sam! Sam...

8
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:39,958
What's the scene?

9
00:02:39,958 --> 00:02:41,292
What time is the sound check?

10
00:02:41,292 --> 00:02:42,833
The scene is not too good.

11
00:02:42,833 --> 00:02:44,333
Some strike is happening.

12
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:46,000
So, nothing is running on the road.

13
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:49,125
Then, why ask us
to perform today?

14
00:02:49,292 --> 00:02:51,417
They actually called
the strike last night.

15
00:02:52,708 --> 00:02:54,208
What about our advance?

16
00:02:54,417 --> 00:02:55,792
We're not going to return that.

17
00:02:55,792 --> 00:02:57,917
As per our terms
and conditions.

18
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:01,750
But how can we take money
and not sing?

19
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:03,875
Try to figure something out.

20
00:03:04,375 --> 00:03:06,958
Even then, you'll be performing
in an empty hall.

21
00:03:06,958 --> 00:03:08,500
That won't be good for you.

22
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:10,333
Then?

23
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:13,167
Let's see if we can do it
tomorrow or day after.

24
00:03:13,542 --> 00:03:16,208
Do you want me to rot
in this hotel room today?

25
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:18,458
Why aren't you here?

26
00:03:18,667 --> 00:03:20,500
I've come to meet my aunt.

27
00:03:20,542 --> 00:03:22,042
I told you yesterday.

28
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:24,875
You don't remember anything
when you're drunk.

29
00:03:26,417 --> 00:03:28,208
Probably had a bit too much
last night.

30
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,125
Can't even lift my head.

31
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:33,708
Well, go to the coffee shop
and just chill.

32
00:03:34,292 --> 00:03:35,833
Enjoy the resort life.

33
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:37,458
I'm trying to come.

34
00:03:38,542 --> 00:03:39,417
Okay.

35
00:03:40,292 --> 00:03:42,208
'Adios amigo'.

36
00:04:59,792 --> 00:05:01,042
Can you believe it?

37
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:03,625
We'll build homes on the Moon...

38
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:07,417
But striking out strikes in this city
is impossible.

39
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
They don't realise the kind of business
we lose.

40
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,958
It's just a holiday for them.

41
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:16,875
One step on the streets
and the rioteers show up.

42
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:20,167
You can't work here.

43
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:22,417
And a good day to you too.

44
00:05:40,792 --> 00:05:41,917
Yes, sir?

45
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:47,083
What the 'onion'
is this?

46
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:48,625
Sorry, sir?

47
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:50,958
Onion rings?
Don't you know what they are?

48
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:53,375
Sir, we don't serve onion rings
for breakfast.

49
00:05:55,542 --> 00:05:56,917
Call your manager.

50
00:05:56,958 --> 00:05:58,208
Sir?

51
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:01,375
Doesn't your hotel have a manager?

52
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,500
Yes, sir.

53
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,125
- Then please call the manager.
- Okay, sir.

54
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,125
Hi!

55
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:19,625
Can I take a selfie with you?

56
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:23,500
Only if I click it.

57
00:06:24,667 --> 00:06:26,292
Sure.

58
00:06:33,958 --> 00:06:34,958
Thank you.

59
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:37,250
With autographs, you get to know
the name of your fan.

60
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:40,792
Oh, my name's Latika.

61
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:42,792
With 'Lobongo' (clove)
or without?

62
00:06:44,917 --> 00:06:46,750
I'm a huge fan of yours.

63
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,500
No, you're not that huge.

64
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:55,292
Don't you have a show here tonight?

65
00:06:55,292 --> 00:06:56,875
- I had.
- You had?

66
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:58,458
But this bloody strike...

67
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:00,208
Oh!

68
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,583
We are from Bhopal.

69
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:06,375
We love you back there.

70
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:08,833
Except your father
who wants you back now.

71
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:11,375
Fa-- Ganesh?

72
00:07:11,708 --> 00:07:14,333
He's my husband.
He doesn't mind.

73
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:16,125
- Oh!
- Yes!

74
00:07:19,167 --> 00:07:22,792
- Okay, bye, Roop.
- See you around, Lobongo.

75
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:24,708
Thank you.

76
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:33,417
Hello, sir.

77
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,125
Were you looking for me?

78
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:37,792
Actually, I was looking for some food.

79
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:39,500
To break my fast.

80
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:41,917
Sir, we have all these breakfast options.

81
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:44,000
- Didn't you tell him?
- Yes, I mean--

82
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,083
Bread, eggs, cornflakes,
rice dumplings, pancakes...

83
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:49,083
Do you expect me to eat all this rubbish
in Kolkata?

84
00:07:49,792 --> 00:07:51,042
Sir?

85
00:07:51,292 --> 00:07:53,250
You must have heard that rhyme,
as a Bengali.

86
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:56,667
"Some fluffy fried bread, some porridge,
some spicy potato curry...

87
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:59,375
Icing on the cake will be
some dessert in a hurry."

88
00:07:59,417 --> 00:08:00,792
I'm so sorry, sir.

89
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:02,833
I'll get you some fried bread and curry
right away.

90
00:08:02,917 --> 00:08:04,833
Not curry. Spicy potato curry.

91
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:06,250
And you can skip the dessert.

92
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:07,875
Sure.

93
00:08:08,292 --> 00:08:09,792
And excuse me, Manager Madam.

94
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:13,750
There's no Wi-Fi, no network.
What's the cause?

95
00:08:13,917 --> 00:08:17,667
Sir, our resort is fully network free.
Tech detox.

96
00:08:17,667 --> 00:08:19,833
Remember, we told you during check in?

97
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:23,458
Tech detox... Take that.

98
00:08:23,792 --> 00:08:26,708
- Get him some fried bread and spicy potato curry.
- Yes, ma'am.

99
00:09:18,042 --> 00:09:19,292
Sorry.

100
00:09:19,417 --> 00:09:21,042
I just had to come sit here.

101
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,250
Actually, it was getting very cold there.
And I realised it's so much hotter at this table.

102
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:28,083
I hope you don't mind.

103
00:09:29,792 --> 00:09:33,042
If I mind now, will you go back?

104
00:09:35,417 --> 00:09:38,208
You, probably, haven't recognised me.

105
00:09:41,667 --> 00:09:43,583
Take off your glasses.

106
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:49,750
No.

107
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,333
Really?

108
00:09:54,042 --> 00:09:56,750
Wow! I like it!

109
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:02,708
I couldn't recognise you
and you like that?

110
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:04,208
Of course.

111
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:08,458
There are very few people
who don't know Roop Ray.

112
00:10:09,667 --> 00:10:11,792
You're truly one of a kind.

113
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:16,042
Your humility knows no bounds.

114
00:10:17,542 --> 00:10:19,542
Roop Ray.

115
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:22,292
Do you run a beauty parlour?

116
00:10:27,792 --> 00:10:30,542
Your sense of humour is...

117
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:33,083
It's really turning me on.

118
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:37,875
Are you always spouting nonsense?

119
00:10:38,167 --> 00:10:41,125
Or is it the end-of-season sale today?

120
00:10:41,792 --> 00:10:44,917
Do you know how much women
love this nonsense?

121
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:47,125
I'm sure.

122
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:50,417
But you won't find one of them
at this table.

123
00:10:53,542 --> 00:10:55,750
Who will I find at this table?

124
00:10:56,292 --> 00:10:58,083
How shameless!

125
00:10:58,542 --> 00:11:01,250
Are you a minister or an actor?

126
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:02,958
Singer.

127
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:05,042
All the same to me.

128
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:08,583
Cinema, music... I don't care for them.

129
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:10,042
Why?

130
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:12,667
Are you a nun?

131
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:19,833
You live in India
and yet you don't enjoy music or movies.

132
00:11:20,042 --> 00:11:22,708
Next you'll say
you don't watch cricket either.

133
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:26,500
You're right.
I don't get to watch it very often.

134
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,375
I spend more time playing it.

135
00:11:28,917 --> 00:11:30,625
I play for India.

136
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,917
Which country do you sing for?

137
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:42,542
That was a little below the belt.

138
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:47,750
Isn't masculinity concentrated
below the belt?

139
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:49,083
Why?

140
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:52,333
Is your prowess restricted only
above the collar?

141
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:58,250
You can't gauge that
sitting on the platform.

142
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,917
For that you must board the train...

143
00:11:59,917 --> 00:12:02,500
Ride all the way...

144
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:05,458
Only after that you will know.

145
00:12:11,167 --> 00:12:12,542
After that...

146
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:14,542
Nice to see,
good to hold.

147
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:18,583
If broken, considered sold...
Won't be like that, right?

148
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:23,333
- Sir, your food.
- Thank you.

149
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:25,875
- Anything for you, ma'am?
- No, I'm good with my matcha tea.

150
00:12:25,917 --> 00:12:27,375
Okay, ma'am.

151
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:30,417
I hope it's okay now.

152
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:34,375
Sir, if you're having dinner with us...

153
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:40,667
we can arrange for a special Bengali spread
in our specialty restaurant, Bhojbari.

154
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:42,667
Thank you.

155
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,125
That depends on madam.

156
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:48,375
She just asked me out
for dinner tonight.

157
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:50,708
Did I?

158
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,250
Didn't you?

159
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:01,750
- I hear there's a strike outside.
- Yes.

160
00:13:03,042 --> 00:13:05,583
Then how can there be an "out"?

161
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:08,083
Let it be here.

162
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:10,083
Let's do it.

163
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:11,458
Let's do it.

164
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:13,417
I'll keep a table for you two.

165
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:15,375
- Eight o'clock?
- Eight o'clock.

166
00:13:15,917 --> 00:13:18,292
Thank you.
Have a lovely day.

167
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:26,292
Eight o'clock!

168
00:13:33,042 --> 00:13:35,292
How will we pass the time in between?

169
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:39,292
I've heard playing cricket is more fun
on strikes.

170
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,000
Bad idea.

171
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:44,000
Your male ego will be hurt.

172
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:50,167
What about the train ride
you were talking about?

173
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:55,375
What if I take up that offer?

174
00:14:31,417 --> 00:14:33,125
I hope Roop Ray is carrying rubber.

175
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:34,375
I hope so too.

176
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,000
What?

177
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:37,958
Oh gosh!

178
00:14:58,458 --> 00:14:59,583
Yes!

179
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,375
"Kama Sutra"?

180
00:15:02,542 --> 00:15:04,417
I hope you know the positions.

181
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:33,708
Oh man!

182
00:15:34,917 --> 00:15:36,708
That was good.

183
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,417
Do I have to call you a "man" now?

184
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:43,792
Sorry, I can't call you Roop Ray.

185
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:46,375
F--k!

186
00:15:46,667 --> 00:15:48,625
I never asked what your name is.

187
00:15:51,833 --> 00:15:54,542
You were too busy sizing me up.

188
00:15:56,167 --> 00:15:58,500
Instead I was cut to size.

189
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,958
Actually, you know what?

190
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:04,875
In a fake world with fake people around
pretending to be fake all the time...

191
00:16:05,042 --> 00:16:07,000
I've become so fake...

192
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:12,375
Meeting a real person like you
has rebooted me.

193
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:17,792
You call that just a meeting?

194
00:16:25,667 --> 00:16:28,667
- Abhiroop.
- Tripti.

195
00:16:29,625 --> 00:16:31,125
Tripti...

196
00:16:32,417 --> 00:16:35,083
Now you can sing something for me.

197
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:37,917
But not something by Roop Ray.

198
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:41,208
Does Abhiroop sing anymore?

199
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:57,000
Hear me out...

200
00:16:57,125 --> 00:17:04,375
My unsure steps
My hidden fears

201
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,208
Hear me out...

202
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:14,958
My hesitant stories

203
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:23,708
Why do I wake up on sleepless nights?

204
00:17:23,958 --> 00:17:29,208
Who do I think about?

205
00:17:32,042 --> 00:17:39,708
Why do I walk down the stairs
of a strange city?

206
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:45,542
Is that your name in neon
calling for me?

207
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:18,167
I spin around you

208
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:23,292
With your hand in mine

209
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:35,583
The forgotten memories pop up
when I try to remember you

210
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:38,250
Hear me out...

211
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:45,625
My unsure steps
My hidden fears

212
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:51,167
Hear me out...

213
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:56,208
My hesitant stories

214
00:18:57,333 --> 00:19:04,958
Why do I wake up on sleepless nights?

215
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:10,458
Who do I think about?

216
00:19:13,292 --> 00:19:20,958
Why do I walk down the stairs
of a strange city?

217
00:19:21,208 --> 00:19:27,083
Is that your name in neon
calling for me?

218
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:43,875
Then...

219
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,792
Then?

220
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:52,208
Then I'll leave for Mumbai
and you'll head to...

221
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:55,958
Where do you stay?

222
00:19:57,875 --> 00:19:59,625
I...

223
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:02,167
I...

224
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:04,375
You don't want to tell me.

225
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:10,792
- No, it's not that... I can't remember--
- You can't remember where you live?

226
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,375
You know, this is why...

227
00:20:14,917 --> 00:20:18,792
The greatest love stories
always remain incomplete.

228
00:20:21,792 --> 00:20:25,833
You wanted something like that
when you came over to my table.

229
00:20:26,167 --> 00:20:28,458
A hook up.
A one night stand.

230
00:20:28,917 --> 00:20:30,333
A romp.

231
00:20:32,292 --> 00:20:34,417
Roop Ray wanted exactly that.

232
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:37,583
But Abhiroop...

233
00:20:40,167 --> 00:20:42,375
But Abhiroop lost himself...

234
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:45,708
when Tripti brought him back
from the dead.

235
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,375
This is the beginning.

236
00:21:14,417 --> 00:21:16,125
Not the end.

237
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,667
We'll see.

238
00:21:24,917 --> 00:21:27,125
Not sure why I'm feeling so sleepy.

239
00:21:27,167 --> 00:21:30,292
Me too.
I can barely keep my eyes open.

240
00:21:32,917 --> 00:21:34,792
Good food. Check.

241
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:37,375
Great sex. Check.

242
00:21:37,917 --> 00:21:39,750
- Very sleepy...
- Check.

243
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:48,167
You can sleep here, Abhiroop.

244
00:21:49,542 --> 00:21:52,708
Why take the effort
to go back to your room?

245
00:21:54,917 --> 00:21:56,958
I thought you'll never ask.

246
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:01,667
Are you a good boy now?

247
00:22:01,792 --> 00:22:05,375
Won't do anything without permission, huh?

248
00:22:48,083 --> 00:22:49,042
Hello?

249
00:22:49,042 --> 00:22:50,500
Are you still sleeping?

250
00:22:50,542 --> 00:22:51,792
Who's this?

251
00:22:51,833 --> 00:22:53,083
Krish. Who else?

252
00:22:54,375 --> 00:22:57,167
Oh, yeah, Krish! Tell me.

253
00:22:58,083 --> 00:23:00,292
You have the pitch at 10.
Remember?

254
00:23:00,875 --> 00:23:03,125
Where are you?
Aren't you coming?

255
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:04,833
My flight didn't take off.

256
00:23:04,833 --> 00:23:06,750
Should have gone with you yesterday.

257
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:10,208
Some strike is happening today so...
No flights are allowed to land.

258
00:23:10,208 --> 00:23:13,875
Really? Motherf--ker,
I'll have to go there alone?

259
00:23:13,875 --> 00:23:16,083
How will you go if there's a strike?

260
00:23:16,083 --> 00:23:18,167
Maybe they'll push it to tomorrow.

261
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:20,250
That'll be good.

262
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:22,333
I have this really bad headache.

263
00:23:22,333 --> 00:23:23,750
That's the pollution for you.

264
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:26,875
Small things like these happen in big cities
like these, 'senorita'.

265
00:23:26,875 --> 00:23:28,375
To hell with your 'senorita'!

266
00:23:28,375 --> 00:23:30,250
I'll just go back to sleep.

267
00:23:30,792 --> 00:23:33,750
But first grab a bite at the coffee shop.

268
00:23:33,833 --> 00:23:36,167
I'll order some room service.

269
00:23:36,167 --> 00:23:38,042
Then there'll be thousands of questions
from HR.

270
00:23:38,042 --> 00:23:40,542
The breakfast served downstairs
is part of the package.

271
00:23:40,542 --> 00:23:41,875
God!

272
00:23:41,875 --> 00:23:44,458
Okay. You owe me one.

273
00:23:44,708 --> 00:23:46,958
Anyway, keep me updated.

274
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:23,833
Can I?
For a second.

275
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:25,625
Sure.

276
00:24:27,583 --> 00:24:29,750
Strike? Really?

277
00:24:29,958 --> 00:24:31,125
So it seems.

278
00:24:31,458 --> 00:24:35,375
They don't realise the kind of business
we lose.

279
00:24:36,625 --> 00:24:38,500
We'll build homes on Moon.

280
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:41,458
But striking out strikes is impossible.

281
00:24:42,125 --> 00:24:44,792
Wow! What a great dialogue!
Is it original?

282
00:24:44,792 --> 00:24:48,125
Original? I think so.
I wrote it.

283
00:24:48,167 --> 00:24:50,625
Well, I thought of it.

284
00:24:52,375 --> 00:24:53,750
Are you sure?

285
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:58,083
Of course! You can't work here.

286
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,875
Hello, ma'am.
These are our options for breakfast.

287
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,667
Eggs?

288
00:25:14,667 --> 00:25:16,917
You can order any kind of eggs.

289
00:25:16,958 --> 00:25:20,583
Scarmbled, omelette, benedict... "Kejriwal"...

290
00:25:20,958 --> 00:25:22,750
- Soft-boiled, two minutes.
- Sure, ma'am.

291
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:23,958
Tea or coffee?

292
00:25:24,125 --> 00:25:25,083
Matcha.

293
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:26,208
Okay, ma'am.

294
00:25:26,333 --> 00:25:28,208
There's no network on my phone.

295
00:25:28,542 --> 00:25:31,125
Ma'am, there's no network,
anywhere in the hotel.

296
00:25:31,125 --> 00:25:33,375
To detox from technology.

297
00:25:33,917 --> 00:25:36,333
Technology detox... Got it.

298
00:26:18,208 --> 00:26:19,792
Hello, what's going on?

299
00:26:20,792 --> 00:26:21,750
What?

300
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:23,125
Why are you staring?

301
00:26:23,458 --> 00:26:24,708
Just like that.

302
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:25,917
What do you mean?
Let me see.

303
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:27,542
- No, no, no...
- Let me see...

304
00:26:34,583 --> 00:26:36,583
Did you ask for my permission?

305
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:39,083
You can't draw without asking.

306
00:26:39,833 --> 00:26:41,417
Really? Why?

307
00:26:41,542 --> 00:26:42,417
What do you mean?

308
00:26:42,417 --> 00:26:46,333
Abroad, you must take consent
from even people in the background.

309
00:26:46,333 --> 00:26:47,833
You must get a signed permission.

310
00:26:48,542 --> 00:26:50,333
But this is not 'abroad'.

311
00:26:50,417 --> 00:26:52,333
And you are no 'background'.
You are the subject.

312
00:26:52,375 --> 00:26:54,500
Exactly! You need my prior permission.

313
00:26:55,708 --> 00:26:57,375
During the Gujarat riots...

314
00:26:57,375 --> 00:26:59,625
the man who was begging for his life...

315
00:26:59,625 --> 00:27:03,000
Did that Qutubuddin Ansari
give permission to be photographed?

316
00:27:03,583 --> 00:27:05,708
Or say Amitabh Bachchan...

317
00:27:05,708 --> 00:27:11,250
He appears in front of his waiting fans
every Sunday.

318
00:27:11,292 --> 00:27:13,667
So many people take his photo,
sketch him...

319
00:27:13,667 --> 00:27:15,375
Am I Amitabh Bachchan?

320
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:18,375
You're not, right?
Then where's the problem?

321
00:27:18,542 --> 00:27:20,458
Please take a seat.
It won't take me long.

322
00:27:20,625 --> 00:27:22,042
Ma'am, should I serve this here?

323
00:27:22,042 --> 00:27:24,375
- Please do and pull the chair up.
- Sure.

324
00:27:24,375 --> 00:27:26,542
Madam will sit. Please...

325
00:27:27,208 --> 00:27:28,542
Ma'am...

326
00:27:30,917 --> 00:27:32,292
Sir, anything for you?

327
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:35,083
- One more black coffee.
- Okay.

328
00:27:35,333 --> 00:27:37,500
Ma'am, should I serve your matcha tea here?

329
00:27:37,625 --> 00:27:38,708
Whatever!

330
00:27:43,917 --> 00:27:47,083
If you stay angry
the mood of the drawing will change.

331
00:27:47,458 --> 00:27:48,583
That won't be nice.

332
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:50,208
Please have your eggs.

333
00:27:51,375 --> 00:27:54,125
They might hatch
if you leave them for too long.

334
00:28:01,458 --> 00:28:04,125
Wait, no... A little to the left.

335
00:28:04,667 --> 00:28:06,375
My left, your right.

336
00:28:06,708 --> 00:28:07,708
Not so...

337
00:28:08,625 --> 00:28:10,792
That's it. Good. Hold.

338
00:28:19,875 --> 00:28:22,083
Are you a professional artist?

339
00:28:22,875 --> 00:28:26,792
I'm a... tissue paper artist.

340
00:28:34,042 --> 00:28:36,750
I'm not asking for your consent.
You can keep that.

341
00:28:37,375 --> 00:28:40,083
If you don't like it,
you can use it and throw it away.

342
00:28:41,417 --> 00:28:44,375
- I thought you were doing it for yourself...
- No, no.

343
00:28:44,833 --> 00:28:46,917
Your face is now imprinted
on my brain.

344
00:28:46,958 --> 00:28:49,458
That won't be erased.
This one is for you.

345
00:28:51,125 --> 00:28:53,292
Can we sit outside?

346
00:28:54,375 --> 00:28:57,833
So many eggs around...
Seems like we're in a chicken farm.

347
00:28:57,875 --> 00:28:59,125
Chicken...

348
00:29:00,625 --> 00:29:02,208
Where outside?

349
00:29:02,208 --> 00:29:04,000
There's a library...

350
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,875
It's really nice.
Let's go.

351
00:29:25,417 --> 00:29:29,292
Other than wasting tissue papers,
what else do you do?

352
00:29:29,625 --> 00:29:31,375
It's better not to say.

353
00:29:31,708 --> 00:29:34,417
Either you won't believe me
or you might get scared.

354
00:29:35,292 --> 00:29:36,542
Of course not.

355
00:29:37,083 --> 00:29:39,000
What do you do?

356
00:29:39,208 --> 00:29:41,500
I'd rather lie to you.

357
00:29:42,375 --> 00:29:44,958
At least, you'd know what I don't do.

358
00:29:45,458 --> 00:29:47,167
What do you think?

359
00:29:47,167 --> 00:29:49,375
Liar! Liar! Pants on fire!

360
00:29:49,625 --> 00:29:51,458
I don't mind.

361
00:29:52,667 --> 00:29:54,250
Fine.

362
00:29:58,458 --> 00:30:00,083
I kill people.

363
00:30:00,583 --> 00:30:01,917
What?!

364
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:05,875
Assassin.

365
00:30:06,208 --> 00:30:08,375
Contract killer.

366
00:30:08,583 --> 00:30:12,292
A lot of people call me a hitman,
a hired gun.

367
00:30:12,625 --> 00:30:15,583
Want me to tell you all the names?

368
00:30:16,167 --> 00:30:18,625
I told you, you won't believe me.

369
00:30:20,375 --> 00:30:22,917
But you said you were lying.

370
00:30:23,167 --> 00:30:26,125
Can you tell which one was the lie?

371
00:30:29,667 --> 00:30:32,667
Forget about me.
What do you do?

372
00:30:32,667 --> 00:30:35,167
Apart from modelling for tissue papers.

373
00:30:36,667 --> 00:30:40,625
- Can I lie too?
- Of course, that's the game.

374
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:43,458
Otherwise, how will I find out the truth?

375
00:30:46,792 --> 00:30:50,458
That chicken farm.
I farm chicken.

376
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:54,375
Wow! That's amazing!

377
00:30:54,917 --> 00:30:57,417
And do you eat up all of them?

378
00:30:58,708 --> 00:31:00,750
I eat some and sell the rest.

379
00:31:02,625 --> 00:31:07,250
Then you must know who came first,
the chicken or the egg.

380
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:10,583
I think love came first.

381
00:31:10,583 --> 00:31:12,792
Otherwise where would the egg come from?

382
00:31:19,458 --> 00:31:22,250
Chicken farmer and hired assassin.

383
00:31:22,417 --> 00:31:24,917
That can be a great love story.

384
00:31:28,333 --> 00:31:30,792
What if the farmer is married?

385
00:31:31,583 --> 00:31:34,792
Will the assassin still fall in love with her?

386
00:31:38,125 --> 00:31:40,292
What if the assassin is married too?

387
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:47,458
Then the two negatives make it positive.

388
00:31:49,417 --> 00:31:51,042
Excuse me?

389
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:57,708
Sorry to disturb you.

390
00:31:58,083 --> 00:32:00,375
Can't recognise you.

391
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:03,917
I'm the manager of the hotel. Kalki Maitra.

392
00:32:04,333 --> 00:32:07,208
Because of the strike
the guests are very bored.

393
00:32:07,292 --> 00:32:10,542
We're planning a party by the pool
in the evening.

394
00:32:10,833 --> 00:32:13,792
If there are enough guests,
we can organise it.

395
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,125
Are you two in?

396
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:18,958
Farmer, what do you think?

397
00:32:19,125 --> 00:32:21,833
If assassin goes, I'm game.

398
00:32:22,292 --> 00:32:25,167
- We are 100% in.
- Fantastic!

399
00:32:25,417 --> 00:32:27,542
Is there a dress code?

400
00:32:27,792 --> 00:32:29,208
Of course.

401
00:32:29,292 --> 00:32:32,000
Whatever is there in your travel bag.

402
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,833
We didn't tell each other the truth.

403
00:32:37,833 --> 00:32:39,750
Didn't even share numbers.

404
00:32:39,875 --> 00:32:43,708
Tomorrow the farmer and assassin's love story
will come to an end.

405
00:32:43,708 --> 00:32:45,708
Not that easy.

406
00:32:46,208 --> 00:32:50,458
This love story will not chicken out so easily.

407
00:32:51,917 --> 00:32:54,583
And there's the chicken itself.

408
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:00,667
Sir, you can try it with the green chutney.

409
00:33:00,792 --> 00:33:03,042
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

410
00:33:10,167 --> 00:33:12,250
I'll finish my meeting tomorrow
and go back to my farm.

411
00:33:13,542 --> 00:33:16,667
I'll come over
under the pretext of some work.

412
00:33:20,958 --> 00:33:22,208
Can I hire you?

413
00:33:24,917 --> 00:33:26,833
Who do I have to kill?

414
00:33:28,375 --> 00:33:32,083
You have to come to my room
to kill that person.

415
00:33:36,542 --> 00:33:41,792
But seriously, how will you find me
without any name or address?

416
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:46,125
Don't spoil this
with name and address.

417
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,583
I'll find you. Trust me.

418
00:33:50,708 --> 00:33:52,917
I want to trust you.

419
00:33:53,583 --> 00:33:56,750
But there are so many people...
So many faces...

420
00:33:57,958 --> 00:34:00,083
So many hearts...

421
00:34:00,542 --> 00:34:03,833
How will you find me
if I get lost?

422
00:34:12,167 --> 00:34:13,583
Follow me.

423
00:34:38,875 --> 00:34:41,292
Hello! Check!

424
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:44,000
Sorry for the interruption.

425
00:34:44,167 --> 00:34:46,792
But what to do?
That's how I am.

426
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:50,250
Farmer, this is for you.

427
00:34:53,583 --> 00:35:04,667
To find you anew

428
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:13,333
I lose you every time

429
00:35:13,708 --> 00:35:28,917
Oh! My treasure of love

430
00:35:28,917 --> 00:35:41,167
To find you anew

431
00:35:48,833 --> 00:36:06,000
When I set out in your quest
My heart trembles in fear

432
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:18,875
With the overwhelming waves of adoration

433
00:36:21,208 --> 00:36:29,708
Your smile washes away...

434
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:39,667
all my tears of sadness

435
00:36:40,583 --> 00:36:53,708
Oh! My treasure of love

436
00:36:54,333 --> 00:37:05,917
To find you anew

437
00:38:03,167 --> 00:38:06,000
This way...
Come in.

438
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:10,292
How will you understand the process
if you don't see it all?

439
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:15,750
She only asked me to show you
the entire thing.

440
00:38:41,583 --> 00:38:43,417
Is he sleeping?

441
00:38:44,292 --> 00:38:47,000
You may call it sleep.
Very deep sleep.

442
00:38:47,833 --> 00:38:51,667
That powder we mixed
in the chicken's marinade...

443
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,667
He'll be over and out for 12 hours.

444
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:07,208
- What is the doctor doing?
- Doctor who? Botuk?

445
00:39:07,875 --> 00:39:09,875
Of course, I'm a doctor.

446
00:39:09,917 --> 00:39:12,750
Hypnotherapists are full-fledged doctors.

447
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:15,750
How will you know, cheap writer?

448
00:39:15,917 --> 00:39:18,917
Do you have any medical certifications
to do all this?

449
00:39:18,917 --> 00:39:22,167
- If caught, you'll be in jail.
- Ah, Ganesh!

450
00:39:22,667 --> 00:39:25,083
Finish explaining the process to Leena.

451
00:39:25,792 --> 00:39:27,667
Well, Leena...

452
00:39:27,708 --> 00:39:32,375
Basically, this is Queen Kalki's version
of "mind reset".

453
00:39:32,458 --> 00:39:35,042
To put it simply "brainwash".

454
00:39:35,042 --> 00:39:38,417
All the thoughts in his head
about being a hitman...

455
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,625
Let's say this...

456
00:39:41,542 --> 00:39:44,042
Now, it's all being...

457
00:39:46,958 --> 00:39:49,167
thrown away.

458
00:39:51,792 --> 00:39:53,958
After this...

459
00:39:54,375 --> 00:40:00,125
we will refill the memory bank afresh.

460
00:40:02,208 --> 00:40:05,125
The new character
I've been working on all day...

461
00:40:05,125 --> 00:40:07,750
will be fed to his brain all night.

462
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:09,583
Through sleep hypnosis.

463
00:40:09,625 --> 00:40:12,250
Courtesy our "doctor", Botuk.

464
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:13,542
Oh!

465
00:40:13,833 --> 00:40:16,417
Who is he today?

466
00:40:16,417 --> 00:40:18,958
Today he's a reporter.

467
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:21,500
Why a reporter?

468
00:40:21,708 --> 00:40:24,958
He'll be curious.
We'll have to keep an eye on him all the time.

469
00:40:25,083 --> 00:40:26,500
Don't you remember
what happened last time?

470
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:28,708
He was a full-on reporter.

471
00:40:28,708 --> 00:40:33,292
This one is a business reporter.
Here to cover a corporate conclave.

472
00:40:33,333 --> 00:40:35,583
Can't you think of something safe?

473
00:40:35,583 --> 00:40:38,667
Like an IT worker type.

474
00:40:38,708 --> 00:40:40,208
We've already done that.

475
00:40:40,458 --> 00:40:42,875
Who wanted a new
and unique character every time?

476
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,458
The channel wanted a salesman.
You haven't done that yet.

477
00:40:45,458 --> 00:40:48,625
How can a salesman stay in such a fancy hotel?
How illogical!

478
00:40:48,625 --> 00:40:50,167
The channel is just lip service!

479
00:40:50,208 --> 00:40:54,167
Ganesh, no one cares about logic right now.

480
00:40:54,292 --> 00:40:55,792
People just want to watch
the two of them.

481
00:40:55,792 --> 00:40:59,250
I can't write anymore
if the character's arc is unclear.

482
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:01,875
Can I please work in peace here?

483
00:41:01,875 --> 00:41:03,750
Constantly playing the radio
in the background.

484
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:05,458
You're playing the radio too.

485
00:41:05,458 --> 00:41:06,375
Button on and off.

486
00:41:07,125 --> 00:41:09,250
But with the attitude of a great scientist!

487
00:41:09,542 --> 00:41:13,333
Madam K, please look for my replacement.

488
00:41:13,458 --> 00:41:16,292
I can't work with this kind of people
around me.

489
00:41:16,542 --> 00:41:19,375
Sometimes I feel like a kindergarten teacher.

490
00:41:19,458 --> 00:41:21,208
Mr. Botuk, please start the feeding.

491
00:41:21,208 --> 00:41:22,500
We'll step outside.

492
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:25,458
Ganesh, let's go to my room.

493
00:41:29,167 --> 00:41:29,875
Let's go.

494
00:41:30,542 --> 00:41:31,833
- Leena?
- Hmm?

495
00:41:31,958 --> 00:41:33,083
Please stay back.

496
00:41:33,458 --> 00:41:35,500
How will you understand the process
if you don't see it all?

497
00:41:38,625 --> 00:41:39,417
Come.

498
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:47,042
Now...

499
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,958
Switch off the lights.

500
00:41:50,875 --> 00:41:51,792
Okay.

501
00:41:55,875 --> 00:41:58,000
There's a switch inside that drawer.

502
00:41:59,208 --> 00:42:00,250
Turn it on.

503
00:42:00,667 --> 00:42:01,542
Okay.

504
00:42:10,667 --> 00:42:12,167
Where should I sit?

505
00:42:19,042 --> 00:42:20,083
Abhishek?

506
00:42:20,583 --> 00:42:22,208
Can you hear me?

507
00:42:23,708 --> 00:42:24,875
Can you remember...

508
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,958
the Pondicherry days?

509
00:42:28,417 --> 00:42:31,417
Your mother settled down with you
in Auroville.

510
00:42:32,417 --> 00:42:35,875
Then you went to
Chennai's School of Journalism.

511
00:42:38,417 --> 00:42:40,208
Can you remember, Abhishek?

512
00:42:47,375 --> 00:42:50,583
Try to come up
with something different, Ganesh.

513
00:42:51,292 --> 00:42:52,750
What is your problem?

514
00:42:53,042 --> 00:42:55,500
The show's rating is so high...
The channel is happy...

515
00:42:55,917 --> 00:42:58,542
What works today,
might not tomorrow.

516
00:42:59,208 --> 00:43:01,417
The show is about couples on first dates.

517
00:43:01,417 --> 00:43:03,750
Why do they have to fall in love
every time?

518
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:05,208
I have nothing to do with it.

519
00:43:05,333 --> 00:43:07,167
You wanted hateable character.
I delivered.

520
00:43:07,375 --> 00:43:09,625
You wanted a manly woman.
I delivered that too.

521
00:43:09,667 --> 00:43:11,958
You wanted married people.
Even that.

522
00:43:11,958 --> 00:43:14,917
And yet two complete strangers
keep falling in love with each other.

523
00:43:15,333 --> 00:43:16,750
Isn't that a little weird?

524
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:19,333
Give me an opportunity to intervene.

525
00:43:19,583 --> 00:43:21,292
I'll turn the story around.

526
00:43:21,333 --> 00:43:22,708
I don't want to.

527
00:43:26,792 --> 00:43:30,167
I want "First Dates"
to be the most natural show in the world.

528
00:43:30,333 --> 00:43:33,417
Unadultered, pure emotions.

529
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,167
Pure for sure but...

530
00:43:39,250 --> 00:43:40,333
But what?

531
00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:43,583
The entire thing is illegal.

532
00:43:44,958 --> 00:43:47,875
Everything is fair in love and entertainment.

533
00:43:48,917 --> 00:43:50,667
How many people
are you going to explain this to?

534
00:43:50,708 --> 00:43:52,875
If word spreads--

535
00:43:53,833 --> 00:43:55,250
Who's going to spread the word?

536
00:43:55,875 --> 00:43:56,917
You?

537
00:43:56,917 --> 00:44:00,167
- Wh-Why would I?
- Then who?

538
00:44:00,458 --> 00:44:04,042
I meant there are so many people
working here so...

539
00:44:04,083 --> 00:44:05,083
Small team.

540
00:44:05,417 --> 00:44:07,042
Everyone has signed an NDA.

541
00:44:07,167 --> 00:44:09,667
Meaning a non-disclosure agreement.

542
00:44:09,708 --> 00:44:12,167
Just like the one you signed.

543
00:44:12,917 --> 00:44:17,125
If my vision is compromised
I'll take everybody down with me.

544
00:44:23,792 --> 00:44:25,417
See who's here.

545
00:44:33,625 --> 00:44:35,167
What's the situation?

546
00:44:35,625 --> 00:44:38,208
I've started the first session on the girl.

547
00:44:38,208 --> 00:44:41,458
The boy must be in his third session by now.

548
00:44:41,458 --> 00:44:43,875
Both of them will be fit
by 6 a.m. tomorrow.

549
00:44:43,875 --> 00:44:48,958
Then you can do hair, make-up and costumes
and wake them up.

550
00:44:49,750 --> 00:44:52,583
Why are they starting to forget
from the evening?

551
00:44:53,250 --> 00:44:55,458
I had warned you about this before.

552
00:44:55,458 --> 00:44:58,750
We might be able to push it
for a couple of days but...

553
00:44:58,750 --> 00:45:04,125
to stretch this hypnoidal state
for more than 12 hours will be unfeasible.

554
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:09,208
I don't ask you these questions
to hear these mouthful words.

555
00:45:09,292 --> 00:45:10,625
What's the solution?

556
00:45:11,708 --> 00:45:13,583
Put them to sleep earlier.

557
00:45:14,125 --> 00:45:16,042
I don't keep them awake because I want to.

558
00:45:16,333 --> 00:45:18,458
I do it for the footage.

559
00:45:21,542 --> 00:45:24,292
Madam K, can I say something?

560
00:45:24,792 --> 00:45:25,667
What?

561
00:45:26,125 --> 00:45:27,875
Mr. Writer is right here.

562
00:45:28,250 --> 00:45:31,708
Can't we increase my role a bit?

563
00:45:31,875 --> 00:45:35,792
The lift reaches the coffee shop
even before I can say my lines.

564
00:45:39,208 --> 00:45:43,208
Both of you are acting so funny
since Leena joined.

565
00:45:43,333 --> 00:45:44,750
What did I do?

566
00:45:45,167 --> 00:45:49,083
Wearing a new wig and playing the husband
early in the morning...

567
00:45:49,208 --> 00:45:50,833
Don't you think I notice?

568
00:45:51,792 --> 00:45:53,458
Improve your Hindi, Mr. Botuk.

569
00:45:53,458 --> 00:45:56,250
If we add more lines,
you'll be in trouble.

570
00:45:57,125 --> 00:45:59,083
Tomorrow is the 50th episode.

571
00:46:00,167 --> 00:46:01,667
A big day tomorrow.

572
00:46:02,042 --> 00:46:04,250
I don't want anyone of you to mess it up.

573
00:46:20,792 --> 00:46:21,542
No.

574
00:46:21,667 --> 00:46:24,208
I'm not going to update you
on my edit status.

575
00:46:25,292 --> 00:46:28,417
Is it your turn today
to call and bug me?

576
00:46:29,292 --> 00:46:30,500
It'll be uploaded.

577
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:31,667
Like every day!

578
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:34,042
Why do you have to rush us every day?

579
00:46:34,125 --> 00:46:35,875
Have we ever missed a deadline?

580
00:46:38,250 --> 00:46:38,958
No.

581
00:46:39,125 --> 00:46:41,583
I had told you before
it won't be possible.

582
00:46:42,833 --> 00:46:45,875
Put it in your channel head's head.

583
00:46:51,833 --> 00:46:53,042
Give it a try.

584
00:46:53,042 --> 00:46:55,042
To contact them directly.

585
00:46:55,083 --> 00:46:56,417
All the best.

586
00:46:56,792 --> 00:46:57,708
Bye.

587
00:46:58,333 --> 00:46:59,708
Was that the channel?

588
00:46:59,792 --> 00:47:00,417
Hmm.

589
00:47:00,792 --> 00:47:02,292
They're launching a new show.

590
00:47:02,292 --> 00:47:05,875
And they want the "First Dates" hit pair
to appear.

591
00:47:07,292 --> 00:47:09,708
Do you think that's possible?

592
00:47:10,167 --> 00:47:11,333
Idiots!

593
00:47:12,958 --> 00:47:13,958
Where's Soni?

594
00:47:14,250 --> 00:47:16,792
Soni has a cold today.

595
00:47:16,958 --> 00:47:18,125
So, who'll make the call?

596
00:47:18,208 --> 00:47:19,667
Today...

597
00:47:19,875 --> 00:47:21,542
Leena can do it.

598
00:47:22,667 --> 00:47:24,542
Then she'll appear later as Latika?

599
00:47:24,792 --> 00:47:28,292
Won't be a problem.
I didn't give her dialogues today.

600
00:47:30,125 --> 00:47:31,167
Let her do it then.

601
00:47:31,250 --> 00:47:33,583
Please explain the character properly
to her.

602
00:47:40,750 --> 00:47:42,792
Show me the guy's corridor.

603
00:47:52,333 --> 00:47:53,833
This is your script.

604
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:54,542
Okay.

605
00:47:54,792 --> 00:47:55,958
- Let's do it then.
- Wait, wait...

606
00:47:58,458 --> 00:47:59,667
You're the editor.

607
00:48:01,333 --> 00:48:03,875
He's one of your favourite reporters
on the team.

608
00:48:04,833 --> 00:48:06,000
The tone is everything.

609
00:48:06,083 --> 00:48:08,375
It's bossy...yet friendly.

610
00:48:09,542 --> 00:48:10,458
Got it.

611
00:48:10,583 --> 00:48:11,833
- May I?
- One minute.

612
00:48:12,833 --> 00:48:15,833
The word "Raka" is the memory trigger.

613
00:48:15,917 --> 00:48:18,708
The sooner you say it, the better.
"Raka".

614
00:48:18,750 --> 00:48:19,833
Say it clearly.

615
00:48:19,875 --> 00:48:21,333
- Raka!
- Raka.

616
00:48:21,583 --> 00:48:22,917
- Okay.
- Call.

617
00:48:23,083 --> 00:48:24,542
Dial 2010.

618
00:48:37,417 --> 00:48:37,792
Hello.

619
00:48:38,292 --> 00:48:39,917
Umm... Abhi?

620
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:41,542
Who?

621
00:48:41,708 --> 00:48:42,333
Really?

622
00:48:42,667 --> 00:48:44,500
Forgot your boss on a day tour?

623
00:48:44,875 --> 00:48:46,958
This is Raka. Raka.

624
00:48:48,208 --> 00:48:49,375
Raka?

625
00:48:50,125 --> 00:48:53,167
Raka! Yes. Sorry.
I have a terrible headache.

626
00:48:53,750 --> 00:48:55,250
Don't have to lie about it.

627
00:48:55,417 --> 00:48:56,500
No, seriously!

628
00:48:56,542 --> 00:48:58,625
Enjoy your paid holiday!

629
00:48:59,958 --> 00:49:00,792
What?

630
00:49:01,125 --> 00:49:03,958
They've called a strike there.
So, the conclave is not happening today.

631
00:49:05,083 --> 00:49:06,500
You don't have to go anywhere. So just...

632
00:49:06,583 --> 00:49:08,083
...chill at the hotel only.

633
00:49:08,792 --> 00:49:09,708
What the fish!

634
00:49:10,583 --> 00:49:13,000
You want me to file a report
about the conclave not happening?

635
00:49:13,333 --> 00:49:15,083
Like a brief.

636
00:49:15,833 --> 00:49:18,542
A...small...brief...

637
00:49:19,083 --> 00:49:20,917
I...I'll let you know.

638
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:23,375
But first go and have your breakfast.

639
00:49:23,417 --> 00:49:24,833
I'll connect later.

640
00:49:26,042 --> 00:49:26,917
Go to the coffee shop.

641
00:49:27,542 --> 00:49:28,125
Sorry?

642
00:49:29,458 --> 00:49:33,792
I've heard the breakfast is great
at the coffee shop there.

643
00:49:33,792 --> 00:49:36,208
So, you go over there
and I'll connect later.

644
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:37,125
Okay?

645
00:49:37,167 --> 00:49:37,792
Okay, bye.

646
00:49:41,375 --> 00:49:44,500
- Did I screw up?
- You were great!

647
00:49:44,958 --> 00:49:46,833
- Let me call the boss.
- Yes.

648
00:49:49,250 --> 00:49:51,250
Phone calls are done.

649
00:49:51,458 --> 00:49:53,375
He'll be in the corridor soon.

650
00:49:55,583 --> 00:49:58,083
Your hero will take a shower now.

651
00:49:58,292 --> 00:49:59,667
Wear his clothes...

652
00:49:59,667 --> 00:50:01,083
Wear his perfume...

653
00:50:01,792 --> 00:50:04,875
There's still a lot of time for him
to come out, Madam K.

654
00:50:06,125 --> 00:50:07,958
Did you work on your Hindi?

655
00:50:10,208 --> 00:50:12,625
There's nothing much
that can be done to it.

656
00:50:15,375 --> 00:50:16,333
Well...

657
00:50:18,958 --> 00:50:20,583
Can I play a Bengali?

658
00:50:20,625 --> 00:50:24,458
From Mr. Mathur to Mr. Mukherjee.

659
00:50:25,208 --> 00:50:29,042
Why will there be so many Bengalis in a hotel
in Bengal, Mr. Botuk?

660
00:50:29,250 --> 00:50:31,792
You can't just wish to be an actor.

661
00:50:32,750 --> 00:50:33,458
He's out!

662
00:50:34,125 --> 00:50:35,125
Go! Go! Go!

663
00:50:35,292 --> 00:50:36,250
Yes!

664
00:50:36,583 --> 00:50:38,208
Everyone on standby.

665
00:50:40,583 --> 00:50:42,042
He didn't pick up the paper today either.

666
00:50:42,292 --> 00:50:44,042
Newspaper for Mr. Botuk!

667
00:50:47,792 --> 00:50:48,917
Mr. Botuk!

668
00:51:01,625 --> 00:51:02,792
Do you have network on your phone?

669
00:51:02,917 --> 00:51:03,667
What?

670
00:51:03,792 --> 00:51:06,000
I don't understand Bengali.

671
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:09,667
I spoke more in English than Bengali.

672
00:51:09,917 --> 00:51:11,667
Do you have network on your phone?

673
00:51:14,250 --> 00:51:15,000
Not at all.

674
00:51:16,333 --> 00:51:17,375
Where are you from?

675
00:51:18,458 --> 00:51:20,333
You don't speak Hindi fluently either.

676
00:51:20,625 --> 00:51:24,083
What do you mean where am I from?
I'm from this world.

677
00:51:24,167 --> 00:51:26,542
Man will build homes on the Moon.

678
00:51:26,542 --> 00:51:31,250
But striking out strikes
in this city is impossible.

679
00:51:31,708 --> 00:51:33,167
What the fish are you saying, man?

680
00:51:33,333 --> 00:51:35,500
You can't work here.

681
00:51:36,125 --> 00:51:37,167
Wait... Who are you?

682
00:51:37,208 --> 00:51:39,750
- You can't work here.
- Excuse me?

683
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:45,083
F--k!

684
00:51:46,125 --> 00:51:47,375
No one's at the reception.

685
00:51:47,375 --> 00:51:49,458
The bouncers are outside.

686
00:51:49,542 --> 00:51:51,583
But how can a hotel reception have nobody?

687
00:51:51,708 --> 00:51:52,625
How would I know?

688
00:51:52,625 --> 00:51:54,708
Every day he goes to the coffee shop directly.

689
00:51:54,792 --> 00:51:56,167
But there used to be someone.

690
00:51:56,250 --> 00:51:59,125
How many times have I said
that we need to be ready for every situation?

691
00:51:59,125 --> 00:52:01,458
You fired the actor
who used to play the receptionist.

692
00:52:01,458 --> 00:52:02,292
Remember?

693
00:52:02,542 --> 00:52:03,333
Whatever!

694
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:04,542
He's still there.

695
00:52:04,833 --> 00:52:06,500
Just send somebody from the coffee shop!

696
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:11,083
But a junior actor might say something wrong,
that'll be worse.

697
00:52:11,375 --> 00:52:13,083
Can I go?

698
00:52:13,083 --> 00:52:15,917
No, you'll be sitting with me as Latika.

699
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,167
You'll be able to handle him?

700
00:52:18,250 --> 00:52:18,667
Yes!

701
00:52:18,750 --> 00:52:19,667
- Go then.
- But...

702
00:52:27,875 --> 00:52:29,250
How can I help you, sir?

703
00:52:30,958 --> 00:52:32,083
Say that again.

704
00:52:32,625 --> 00:52:33,750
Sorry, sir...

705
00:52:34,458 --> 00:52:35,500
Say that line again.

706
00:52:36,958 --> 00:52:38,458
How can I help?

707
00:52:39,667 --> 00:52:41,583
I've heard your voice somewhere before.

708
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,667
A lot of people say that, sir.

709
00:52:45,333 --> 00:52:46,292
Where are the people?

710
00:52:46,375 --> 00:52:48,417
- Is it low season?
- Yes, sir.

711
00:52:49,542 --> 00:52:50,875
It's not really low.

712
00:52:51,042 --> 00:52:52,083
There's no one around.

713
00:52:52,208 --> 00:52:53,583
Everyone is in the coffee shop.

714
00:52:53,583 --> 00:52:54,458
Why?

715
00:52:55,208 --> 00:52:57,167
Having breakfast, sir.

716
00:52:57,542 --> 00:52:59,542
Everyone is having breakfast
at the same time?

717
00:53:00,583 --> 00:53:02,708
It happens at times.

718
00:53:03,917 --> 00:53:04,625
Raka.

719
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:07,708
Sorry?

720
00:53:08,458 --> 00:53:10,292
You sound like my editor, Raka.

721
00:53:11,125 --> 00:53:12,500
Really, sir?

722
00:53:13,083 --> 00:53:14,375
What a coincidence!

723
00:53:15,208 --> 00:53:17,333
I have no network on my phone.
Can you arrange a cab for me?

724
00:53:17,417 --> 00:53:18,292
Sure, sir!

725
00:53:19,208 --> 00:53:21,708
There's a strike going on outside.

726
00:53:21,750 --> 00:53:23,833
It's going to be really tough
getting a cab.

727
00:53:24,958 --> 00:53:26,375
Who's called the strike?

728
00:53:27,292 --> 00:53:27,917
What?

729
00:53:28,292 --> 00:53:29,833
Which party has called the strike?

730
00:53:31,125 --> 00:53:32,375
I'm not sure, sir.

731
00:53:32,458 --> 00:53:33,542
You're not sure?

732
00:53:33,833 --> 00:53:35,167
You don't read the newspaper?

733
00:53:37,083 --> 00:53:38,583
Where's today's newspaper?

734
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:46,833
Is this today's paper?

735
00:53:47,792 --> 00:53:48,667
Probably.

736
00:53:48,792 --> 00:53:50,417
What do you mean?
What's today's date?

737
00:53:51,750 --> 00:53:54,375
- Today is...
- Never mind.

738
00:53:55,333 --> 00:53:57,208
It's written here that there's a strike.

739
00:53:58,583 --> 00:53:59,708
Try for a cab, please.

740
00:53:59,708 --> 00:54:01,458
- I'll just grab a coffee.
- Sure, sir.

741
00:54:01,542 --> 00:54:03,875
Coffee shop is right down the corridor
to your left.

742
00:54:04,208 --> 00:54:04,917
Thanks.

743
00:54:13,625 --> 00:54:15,250
Morning. Room number, sir?

744
00:54:19,208 --> 00:54:20,250
Room 2010.

745
00:54:20,542 --> 00:54:22,375
- Please have a seat.
- Thank you.

746
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:27,875
Sir, we have these options for breakfast.

747
00:54:28,083 --> 00:54:30,042
- I am Bengali.
- Sorry, sir.

748
00:54:30,458 --> 00:54:32,167
- Would you...
- Just a cup of black coffee.

749
00:54:32,208 --> 00:54:33,833
- Can you make it with honey?
- Sure, sir.

750
00:54:33,875 --> 00:54:34,500
Thank you.

751
00:54:35,292 --> 00:54:37,042
Do you live in the hotel?

752
00:54:37,750 --> 00:54:38,833
No, why, sir?

753
00:54:39,250 --> 00:54:40,792
How did you travel in the strike?

754
00:54:41,125 --> 00:54:44,083
I knew about the strike yesterday.

755
00:54:44,167 --> 00:54:46,042
That's why I stayed back last night.

756
00:54:47,125 --> 00:54:47,958
Smart!

757
00:54:48,667 --> 00:54:51,125
- Okay. Please get me the coffee.
- Okay, sir.

758
00:55:07,583 --> 00:55:08,458
Excuse me?

759
00:55:09,792 --> 00:55:11,125
Hi, I'm Tapsee.

760
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:13,500
Abhishek.

761
00:55:31,958 --> 00:55:33,458
Excuse me?

762
00:55:34,583 --> 00:55:36,625
Hi, I am Tapsee.

763
00:55:36,625 --> 00:55:38,292
- Abhishek.
- You're a Bengali?

764
00:55:38,292 --> 00:55:39,917
Yes.
How did you know?

765
00:55:39,917 --> 00:55:43,417
The way you pronounced your name.

766
00:55:43,667 --> 00:55:45,708
So, are you "Taposhi"?

767
00:55:45,708 --> 00:55:50,125
Yeah, everyone calls me Tapsee in Pune.
Hence, Taposhi became Tapsee.

768
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:52,208
So tell me, Taposhi.

769
00:55:52,208 --> 00:55:55,917
Well, you seem the kind
whom I can ask...

770
00:55:55,917 --> 00:55:59,167
- Please take a seat.
- Yeah...thank you.

771
00:56:02,208 --> 00:56:04,708
- What were you saying?
- Yes...

772
00:56:04,708 --> 00:56:07,375
I had a fashion show today.

773
00:56:07,375 --> 00:56:09,083
- So when I was--
- Are you a model?

774
00:56:10,125 --> 00:56:11,208
Kind of...

775
00:56:11,208 --> 00:56:13,917
- So I--
- Don't you people eat?

776
00:56:14,125 --> 00:56:16,375
Or do you eat
and then throw it all up?

777
00:56:18,958 --> 00:56:21,333
Sorry.
Always wanted to ask.

778
00:56:21,333 --> 00:56:23,333
No, that's alright.

779
00:56:23,375 --> 00:56:26,333
People have this notion
about models...

780
00:56:26,333 --> 00:56:30,667
that they don't eat anything...
They are stupid...

781
00:56:30,667 --> 00:56:32,542
They sleep around...

782
00:56:32,542 --> 00:56:35,333
Unfortunately, I can't check off
any of the boxes.

783
00:56:35,333 --> 00:56:37,333
You are not tall
like a giraffe either.

784
00:56:37,875 --> 00:56:40,667
And I eat a lot!
Wait, I'll show you.

785
00:56:41,458 --> 00:56:43,917
- Excuse me?
- Yes, ma'am?

786
00:56:44,542 --> 00:56:47,625
- Can I have a 'Masala' Dosa?
- Okay, ma'am.

787
00:56:47,625 --> 00:56:49,833
- And a cheese omelette?
- Sure, ma'am.

788
00:56:49,833 --> 00:56:52,708
- And do you have pancakes?
- We can make them for you, ma'am.

789
00:56:52,708 --> 00:56:56,333
Okay. Then pancake with honey
and chocolate syrup.

790
00:56:56,333 --> 00:56:58,333
- Sure, ma'am.
- Thank you.

791
00:56:59,417 --> 00:57:01,375
I didn't ask you
to enact the Last Supper.

792
00:57:01,375 --> 00:57:03,292
No, I'm feeling hungry.

793
00:57:03,292 --> 00:57:07,875
In case I can't finish it all,
you're there to help me.

794
00:57:08,792 --> 00:57:11,625
- What did you want to ask me?
- Yeah, right.

795
00:57:11,625 --> 00:57:13,625
There's a strike outside...

796
00:57:13,625 --> 00:57:16,375
And I asked some people here
but no one's stepping out.

797
00:57:16,375 --> 00:57:20,125
So...if you're planning
to step out, maybe you can give me a ride?

798
00:57:20,125 --> 00:57:22,917
Even I'm dying to get out.
I asked the hotel guys for a cab.

799
00:57:23,167 --> 00:57:24,583
Didn't sound very helpful.

800
00:57:24,583 --> 00:57:26,542
- No network on the phone either.
- Even on yours?

801
00:57:26,542 --> 00:57:28,417
- No.
- Sir, your coffee.

802
00:57:28,417 --> 00:57:32,583
Okay but there's no network on the phone...
No cabs outside... Is this a hotel or a jail?

803
00:57:33,375 --> 00:57:36,375
Have you read 'Frankenstein', Ganesh?

804
00:57:36,375 --> 00:57:41,792
Those who haven't, think that
Frankenstein was the name of the monster.

805
00:57:41,792 --> 00:57:43,667
But it's not so.

806
00:57:43,667 --> 00:57:48,167
The stupid scientist who created the monster
was called Frankenstein.

807
00:57:48,583 --> 00:57:50,917
That's you.

808
00:57:54,375 --> 00:57:57,083
Don't put it all on me.

809
00:57:57,500 --> 00:58:00,167
You are the ringmaster.

810
00:58:00,167 --> 00:58:07,417
The circus is yours, the jokers are yours.
You need to manage them.

811
00:58:07,417 --> 00:58:10,708
I told you so many times
not to make him a reporter.

812
00:58:10,708 --> 00:58:14,042
Even the girl wants to step out.
She's a fashion model.

813
00:58:14,042 --> 00:58:16,250
Why didn't you sit there today?

814
00:58:17,292 --> 00:58:25,375
Well... Leena became the receptionist today,
so I didn't want to sit alone...

815
00:58:33,750 --> 00:58:40,083
So, should I give them
their daily dose now?

816
00:58:40,875 --> 00:58:45,125
Then they'll be unconscious all day.
I can't lose the whole day.

817
00:58:45,125 --> 00:58:47,958
We don't have any episode
in the bank.

818
00:58:49,542 --> 00:58:52,000
Get my manager's suit ready.

819
00:58:52,333 --> 00:58:53,625
Go!

820
00:59:00,583 --> 00:59:04,500
- Your eating is impressive!
- I won't throw it up.

821
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:08,875
- You'll probably burn it out at the gym.
- No, my metabolism is high.

822
00:59:08,875 --> 00:59:13,417
Just the thought
of ice cream makes me fat.

823
00:59:14,083 --> 00:59:18,083
- Actually, what do you do, Abhishek?
- A very boring job.

824
00:59:18,083 --> 00:59:20,375
Business reporter for a magazine.

825
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:26,375
- You must've been good at math growing up.
- No, I wanted to become a detective.

826
00:59:26,375 --> 00:59:30,625
I knew all the detective stories by heart.
Would practice in front of the mirror.

827
00:59:32,042 --> 00:59:38,042
Staying away from Bengal
makes you more of a Bengali.

828
00:59:38,042 --> 00:59:41,875
Whether that's the Durga festival,
story books or Tagore's songs.

829
00:59:41,875 --> 00:59:46,417
Even I had to learn Tagore's songs at Pune.
Where did you learn them?

830
00:59:46,417 --> 00:59:49,500
Pondicherry.
My mom's at Auroville.

831
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:52,833
Are you married?

832
00:59:52,833 --> 00:59:55,500
I'm so sorry.
It just came out.

833
00:59:55,500 --> 01:00:00,250
I think so loudly at times...
that you can hear me.

834
01:00:00,792 --> 01:00:03,917
No, I'm not married.

835
01:00:03,917 --> 01:00:09,125
I had come very close once
but didn't cross the finish line.

836
01:00:09,917 --> 01:00:13,208
Why didn't you go through
with it?

837
01:00:14,083 --> 01:00:16,333
She went back to her ex.

838
01:00:16,333 --> 01:00:19,208
Between the engagement and the wedding.

839
01:00:19,208 --> 01:00:21,083
Strange timing, isn't it?

840
01:00:21,833 --> 01:00:26,208
It just touched the bat and through the covers!
Boundary. Smooth as butter.

841
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:30,958
- I can't eat these pancakes anymore.
- I'm also done.

842
01:00:31,083 --> 01:00:36,167
- Then let's go for a tour of the strike?
- Sure, it'll be quite an adventure.

843
01:00:36,167 --> 01:00:38,583
- Let's go!
- Let's.

844
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:44,000
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning. Can I help you?

845
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:47,375
- I believe you asked for a cab.
- Yes. Who are you?

846
01:00:47,375 --> 01:00:50,083
Sorry, I'm the manager
of the hotel, Kalki Maitra.

847
01:00:50,083 --> 01:00:51,833
We've arranged for a cab.

848
01:00:51,833 --> 01:00:54,667
It'll be here by 11.

849
01:00:54,750 --> 01:00:58,167
- It's not even 10 yet.
- There's a strike sir, I hope you understand.

850
01:00:58,167 --> 01:01:01,458
None of cabs we have a tie-up with,
have left home.

851
01:01:01,458 --> 01:01:04,792
Only this one car has agreed to come...
It'll be here soon.

852
01:01:04,792 --> 01:01:07,792
- Have you been to our quay area?
- What?

853
01:01:07,792 --> 01:01:10,667
It's a beautiful place.
You can take a walk.

854
01:01:11,375 --> 01:01:15,000
- Would you like to?
- After all that food, we sure need a walk.

855
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,333
I'll have someone escort
you two there.

856
01:01:17,333 --> 01:01:18,708
And I'll let you know
when the cab's here.

857
01:01:18,708 --> 01:01:20,125
- Enjoy your walk.
- Thank you.

858
01:01:32,333 --> 01:01:37,250
You walk around in such high heels,
don't you feel you'll fall down?

859
01:01:37,667 --> 01:01:40,458
- Not really.
- Seriously?

860
01:01:40,458 --> 01:01:45,417
If Mrs. Bachchan wore heels like these,
she would match her husband's height.

861
01:01:46,292 --> 01:01:49,292
- You exaggerate so much!
- No, I'm not kidding.

862
01:01:49,292 --> 01:01:52,042
Seriously, walking on the ramp
is an art.

863
01:01:52,042 --> 01:01:58,375
And the way you move your hips!
Amazing!

864
01:01:58,375 --> 01:02:02,542
Actually, it's not that tough.
You can do it too. Let's try!

865
01:02:02,542 --> 01:02:04,042
- Huh?
- Hmm.

866
01:02:06,167 --> 01:02:09,583
Watch.

867
01:02:14,917 --> 01:02:20,333
- Poetry!
- Really? Your turn to write now.

868
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:28,875
- This'll be a walk of shame.
- It can also be a hall of fame.

869
01:02:28,875 --> 01:02:31,333
Just try once.
Come on.

870
01:02:31,708 --> 01:02:33,375
Go ahead.
You can do it.

871
01:02:41,833 --> 01:02:44,458
You see?
I'm a comedy show in motion!

872
01:02:44,458 --> 01:02:46,750
You have to keep
three things in mind.

873
01:02:46,750 --> 01:02:52,125
Shoulders back, hips in front,
legs straight.

874
01:02:53,792 --> 01:02:55,792
Now, walk.

875
01:02:56,417 --> 01:03:00,583
- How will I walk this way?
- Take one step at a time. Like this.

876
01:03:00,583 --> 01:03:02,208
Easy!

877
01:03:03,208 --> 01:03:08,833
Keep the weight forward.
As if you're gliding, not walking. Like this.

878
01:03:08,833 --> 01:03:12,083
Come on...yeah...
Hey!

879
01:03:16,542 --> 01:03:20,167
Are you okay?
You don't have to walk anymore.

880
01:03:20,542 --> 01:03:23,208
How did she learn
to walk like that?

881
01:03:24,833 --> 01:03:28,917
All these skills, talents,
general knowledge...

882
01:03:28,917 --> 01:03:32,250
Do you write differently
for each character every day?

883
01:03:32,250 --> 01:03:37,125
- Yeah so basically--
- I'll explain it to you.

884
01:03:37,125 --> 01:03:40,583
There are different chambers
in the brain.

885
01:03:40,583 --> 01:03:43,333
We keep 80 to 90%
of the matter the same.

886
01:03:43,958 --> 01:03:47,917
We only change the history
of the character every day.

887
01:03:47,917 --> 01:03:51,500
- What about the minute details?
-They are no big deal.

888
01:03:51,500 --> 01:03:53,875
The guy knows how to sing,
so he sings.

889
01:03:53,875 --> 01:03:57,375
The girl knows how to walk like that,
so she walks.

890
01:03:57,375 --> 01:03:59,375
What about their love
for each other?

891
01:04:00,083 --> 01:04:04,333
- Did we set that up too?
- No, no, no.

892
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,250
That's entirely them.

893
01:04:08,875 --> 01:04:13,000
But let's not blame it
on their brains.

894
01:04:14,125 --> 01:04:16,208
It's their hearts.

895
01:04:18,250 --> 01:04:21,417
But spying on them this way...

896
01:04:23,125 --> 01:04:27,625
- Feels voyeuristic.
- There are no cameras in their rooms.

897
01:04:27,625 --> 01:04:29,667
This is a public place, Leena.

898
01:04:29,667 --> 01:04:32,625
But they believe they're alone.

899
01:04:32,625 --> 01:04:37,208
Then close your eyes if you don't want to watch
the adult content.

900
01:04:37,208 --> 01:04:41,292
I always enjoy a good love story.

901
01:04:42,333 --> 01:04:46,000
You've never had one
that's why it feels so good.

902
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:52,208
Ganesh, if I swap your right and left brains,
then you'll know.

903
01:04:52,208 --> 01:04:55,083
- Uncivilised!
- Hush!

904
01:04:56,542 --> 01:04:58,292
We can use this portion.

905
01:04:58,417 --> 01:05:01,417
- Are the audio levels fine?
- Yes, ma'am.

906
01:05:01,708 --> 01:05:03,333
Are you sure you're comfortable?

907
01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:04,750
Should I get some ice for you?

908
01:05:04,750 --> 01:05:07,250
- No, no.
- If you rub some ice, you'll feel much better.

909
01:05:07,250 --> 01:05:11,000
- I'm speaking from experience.
- Not a fan of icing or heating.

910
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:16,708
But as per your instructions,
I did glide, didn't I?

911
01:05:16,917 --> 01:05:19,625
Sorry...
Is it still hurting?

912
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:22,750
Ego, yes.
Foot, no.

913
01:05:24,667 --> 01:05:26,792
But I've discovered your diet secret.

914
01:05:27,125 --> 01:05:30,083
From tomorrow, I'll stop gymming
and walk like this every day.

915
01:05:30,625 --> 01:05:33,167
With practice, you'll easily pick it up.

916
01:05:33,167 --> 01:05:34,792
And then maybe,
a change of career.

917
01:05:35,667 --> 01:05:37,583
It'll be a great headline.

918
01:05:37,792 --> 01:05:42,583
"Jilted lover walks in
imaginary fashion shows".

919
01:05:46,583 --> 01:05:52,125
The real loser is the one
who left you.

920
01:05:52,125 --> 01:05:57,000
Maybe she hit a decent cover drive
but she was run-out on the very next ball.

921
01:05:59,167 --> 01:06:04,542
Some people love the idea of love,
not the person.

922
01:06:05,875 --> 01:06:07,958
Some people who?

923
01:06:09,083 --> 01:06:10,875
My boyfriend also dumped me.

924
01:06:10,875 --> 01:06:12,292
On my birthday.

925
01:06:12,708 --> 01:06:15,583
What the f...

926
01:06:17,583 --> 01:06:20,125
- I'm sorry.
- I'm not.

927
01:06:20,125 --> 01:06:23,833
In fact, I'm grateful...

928
01:06:23,833 --> 01:06:28,750
that I don't have to spend my entire life
with him.

929
01:06:30,417 --> 01:06:35,500
But the way he's broken me
from within...

930
01:06:37,542 --> 01:06:41,125
that I haven't been able to love anyone
ever again.

931
01:06:45,833 --> 01:06:47,542
Just imagine...

932
01:06:47,792 --> 01:06:50,458
if you can love the wrong person so much...

933
01:06:50,458 --> 01:06:53,375
how deeply you will love the right person.

934
01:06:58,625 --> 01:07:01,333
Have you been able
to love anyone else?

935
01:07:05,542 --> 01:07:08,792
Maybe I haven't found the right one,
so I haven't...

936
01:07:09,583 --> 01:07:11,083
Who's the right person?

937
01:07:11,083 --> 01:07:13,208
Will they have it written on their heads?

938
01:07:13,667 --> 01:07:16,375
Heads don't work
in this department.

939
01:07:17,375 --> 01:07:21,125
But the heart automatically opens up
at the right moment.

940
01:07:25,750 --> 01:07:28,083
Open Sesame?

941
01:07:59,583 --> 01:08:01,792
They told me all flights are cancelled
for the strike.

942
01:08:01,792 --> 01:08:03,708
That's what they told me too.

943
01:08:04,917 --> 01:08:07,375
What the fish is going on here?

944
01:08:23,750 --> 01:08:25,542
What's wrong with him?

945
01:08:26,917 --> 01:08:28,750
He's one of our guests.

946
01:08:28,750 --> 01:08:31,000
He had gone out for some work
this morning.

947
01:08:31,125 --> 01:08:33,333
Yeah, I met him in the elevator.

948
01:08:33,333 --> 01:08:36,750
Very close to the hotel,
a bunch of political goons attacked him.

949
01:08:36,750 --> 01:08:39,208
Thankfully, Inspector Ganesh found him.

950
01:08:39,208 --> 01:08:43,917
Thankfully, he had his hotel room card on him.
So, I could bring him back.

951
01:08:43,917 --> 01:08:50,083
- Otherwise, the way they beat him...
- Yeah, he's bleeding heavily.

952
01:08:50,083 --> 01:08:52,125
Why didn't you arrest them?

953
01:08:52,583 --> 01:08:56,042
You've no idea how dangerous
it is outside.

954
01:08:56,042 --> 01:08:59,417
There's violence everywhere.
It's a complete riot.

955
01:08:59,417 --> 01:09:02,417
If I arrest someone,
it will only get worse.

956
01:09:02,750 --> 01:09:05,250
So you'll allow such attacks
on innocent civilians?

957
01:09:05,250 --> 01:09:07,000
I didn't allow it.

958
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,875
He survived because I reached on time.

959
01:09:09,875 --> 01:09:12,208
But I think we should take him
to a hospital.

960
01:09:12,208 --> 01:09:14,833
Where am I?

961
01:09:15,542 --> 01:09:17,875
You're absolutely safe wherever you are.

962
01:09:17,875 --> 01:09:20,583
Please rest quietly.

963
01:09:20,583 --> 01:09:25,500
- I shouldn't have gone out...
- Yes, that's correct.

964
01:09:26,083 --> 01:09:27,708
Kalki Madam?

965
01:09:27,708 --> 01:09:29,083
Now it's your responsibility.

966
01:09:29,083 --> 01:09:32,458
Make sure no one else
leaves the hotel.

967
01:09:32,458 --> 01:09:34,750
He's fortunate enough to be alive.

968
01:09:35,250 --> 01:09:37,583
The next person might not be
so lucky.

969
01:09:37,583 --> 01:09:40,583
Why don't you escort us out,
Inspector Ganesh?

970
01:09:41,542 --> 01:09:42,792
Where do you want to go?

971
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:44,042
I have some work.

972
01:09:44,292 --> 01:09:45,583
You are not a local.

973
01:09:45,583 --> 01:09:47,625
You don't know about the strikes here.

974
01:09:47,625 --> 01:09:49,208
I am a journalist.

975
01:09:49,208 --> 01:09:50,792
I have some idea I think.

976
01:09:51,917 --> 01:09:53,208
Journalist?

977
01:09:53,833 --> 01:09:55,250
What do you write about?

978
01:09:55,625 --> 01:09:57,917
- About business.
- Businesses are shut.

979
01:09:57,917 --> 01:09:59,500
Everything is shut.

980
01:09:59,500 --> 01:10:03,500
Stay inside the hotel.
You'll be safe.

981
01:10:04,542 --> 01:10:09,708
- I'll be on my way, madam.
- Thank you, Inspector.

982
01:10:16,333 --> 01:10:18,792
It's going to be 11 again at night,
Manager Maitra?

983
01:10:18,792 --> 01:10:20,333
Has the cab arrived?

984
01:10:20,333 --> 01:10:22,333
Do you still want to go out?

985
01:10:22,333 --> 01:10:24,333
I believe I can take care of myself.

986
01:10:26,875 --> 01:10:29,667
The guests at this hotel
are my responsibility.

987
01:10:29,667 --> 01:10:32,750
And given the circumstances,
I can't allow you to step out.

988
01:10:32,750 --> 01:10:36,000
- Sorry, sir.
- You'll stop me from going out?

989
01:10:36,583 --> 01:10:38,792
If need be, yes.

990
01:10:38,792 --> 01:10:40,292
I have to do my duty.

991
01:10:40,292 --> 01:10:41,917
Do you even realise
what you're saying?

992
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,500
All I'm saying there's trouble outside
and you shouldn't step out.

993
01:10:44,500 --> 01:10:47,125
Let me find that out
for myself.

994
01:10:47,792 --> 01:10:51,167
- Taposhi, are you coming along?
- Of course.

995
01:11:07,958 --> 01:11:09,833
I was kidding, Kalki "Madam".

996
01:11:10,167 --> 01:11:14,250
I'd be crazy to go out
into the strike to show off my bravery.

997
01:11:15,208 --> 01:11:17,042
I'm hungry again!

998
01:11:17,250 --> 01:11:19,250
Don't you have a speciality restaurant?

999
01:11:19,708 --> 01:11:23,042
On the first floor, Bhojbari.
Bengali food.

1000
01:11:23,042 --> 01:11:24,583
Just what I need.

1001
01:11:24,583 --> 01:11:25,917
What do you think, Taposhi?

1002
01:11:26,458 --> 01:11:27,917
Yeah, we could go.

1003
01:11:27,917 --> 01:11:30,125
We could eat!
Let's go.

1004
01:11:30,250 --> 01:11:31,583
But him?

1005
01:11:31,583 --> 01:11:33,000
He'll be alright.

1006
01:11:33,250 --> 01:11:34,875
We'll take care of him.

1007
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:40,625
What are we doing here?

1008
01:11:43,667 --> 01:11:45,250
My God!

1009
01:11:45,250 --> 01:11:46,833
Is it a menu or an aquarium?

1010
01:11:47,208 --> 01:11:48,625
So many kinds of fish.

1011
01:11:49,333 --> 01:11:51,500
What would you like?

1012
01:11:55,333 --> 01:11:57,833
Of all the fish...

1013
01:11:58,750 --> 01:12:02,292
hilsa is my favourite but...

1014
01:12:03,083 --> 01:12:06,833
It has so many bones
that I can't eat it properly.

1015
01:12:09,500 --> 01:12:11,292
Suddenly...

1016
01:12:11,708 --> 01:12:13,625
why are they discussing fish?

1017
01:12:13,625 --> 01:12:15,167
They're relaxed now.

1018
01:12:15,458 --> 01:12:17,958
Bengalis discuss fish
when they're relaxed.

1019
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,042
Nope.

1020
01:12:19,667 --> 01:12:21,208
Something else is going on.

1021
01:12:21,875 --> 01:12:23,292
Something's fishy.

1022
01:12:23,542 --> 01:12:25,042
You worry without any reason.

1023
01:12:25,375 --> 01:12:27,208
They're right in front of us.
How will they escape?

1024
01:12:27,292 --> 01:12:30,125
- Why don't you decide?
- Let me see.

1025
01:12:31,625 --> 01:12:36,667
I've always liked prawns.

1026
01:12:37,333 --> 01:12:38,792
Yeah... Yeah...

1027
01:12:38,792 --> 01:12:43,958
But technically, prawns aren't fish.
More like...

1028
01:12:45,083 --> 01:12:45,875
bugs!

1029
01:12:47,917 --> 01:12:49,917
Have you sent Mr. Botuk to his room?

1030
01:12:50,500 --> 01:12:52,042
He's on DND mode.

1031
01:12:52,042 --> 01:12:53,708
Probably ordering room service!

1032
01:12:55,042 --> 01:12:56,167
And the others?

1033
01:12:56,292 --> 01:12:58,167
I gave them a lunch break.

1034
01:12:58,167 --> 01:13:00,875
They haven't had a scope to eat
with all the ruckus.

1035
01:13:01,708 --> 01:13:03,125
What's coming in?

1036
01:13:06,042 --> 01:13:09,042
Oh, that's our monthly food supply van.

1037
01:13:09,125 --> 01:13:10,875
What a day to deliver!

1038
01:13:11,292 --> 01:13:12,708
I'll look into it.

1039
01:13:12,708 --> 01:13:15,333
The inspector will receive the hotel's
vegetable supply?

1040
01:13:15,333 --> 01:13:17,583
What if they return
to the lobby?

1041
01:13:18,500 --> 01:13:21,792
Then no one can receive it.
Everyone's in character.

1042
01:13:21,958 --> 01:13:25,792
- The hotel manager can.
- That's true.

1043
01:13:26,417 --> 01:13:28,292
Keep an eye on them, Ganesh.

1044
01:13:29,208 --> 01:13:31,083
Just chill.

1045
01:13:32,542 --> 01:13:33,458
Ready to order, sir?

1046
01:13:34,792 --> 01:13:36,458
There's a strike outside.

1047
01:13:36,458 --> 01:13:37,875
Will the fish be fresh?

1048
01:13:37,875 --> 01:13:39,667
It's not like that, sir.

1049
01:13:39,667 --> 01:13:40,875
What is it like, then?

1050
01:13:40,875 --> 01:13:43,458
- The fish will be fresh.
- Which fish will be fresh?

1051
01:13:43,458 --> 01:13:46,000
- Hilsa, carp--
- Prawns?

1052
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,333
Yes, prawns are available.

1053
01:13:47,500 --> 01:13:50,583
Prawns cook really fast, don't they?

1054
01:13:50,583 --> 01:13:53,208
Sir, that entirely depends
on the preparation.

1055
01:13:53,208 --> 01:13:55,958
Like prawns steamed in tender coconut
will take more time.

1056
01:13:56,333 --> 01:13:59,042
Oh! That's exactly what I wanted.

1057
01:13:59,042 --> 01:13:59,958
Sure, sir.

1058
01:14:00,750 --> 01:14:04,208
And for madam,
if you can get some boneless hilsa...

1059
01:14:04,208 --> 01:14:06,792
Yeah, I can't remove the bones at all.

1060
01:14:06,792 --> 01:14:10,458
Ma'am, sir,
it'll take a little longer then.

1061
01:14:10,458 --> 01:14:11,667
Take your time.

1062
01:14:11,833 --> 01:14:13,708
There's a strike going on.
What's the rush?

1063
01:14:13,708 --> 01:14:15,250
Sure, sure, sure.

1064
01:14:15,625 --> 01:14:17,000
We'll serve with some rice.

1065
01:14:17,167 --> 01:14:18,125
Thank you.

1066
01:14:24,125 --> 01:14:26,000
I need to use the washroom.

1067
01:14:26,292 --> 01:14:27,333
Okay.

1068
01:14:30,167 --> 01:14:32,542
We'll only get the scraps...

1069
01:14:32,542 --> 01:14:35,292
And you'll gorge on hilsa and prawn?

1070
01:14:37,625 --> 01:14:38,958
Rudra?

1071
01:14:40,458 --> 01:14:44,333
Pull up a close-up of the girl
on the master frame.

1072
01:14:53,958 --> 01:14:55,833
Isn't she beautiful?

1073
01:14:56,875 --> 01:14:59,333
You can fall in love with her every day.

1074
01:15:00,792 --> 01:15:03,042
Wrong number, Ganesh!

1075
01:15:03,292 --> 01:15:07,000
See how Mr. Botuk is hitting on
your Leena.

1076
01:15:14,250 --> 01:15:15,167
Damn it!

1077
01:15:15,792 --> 01:15:17,708
Bloody fake doctor!

1078
01:15:18,417 --> 01:15:21,792
I just parked him in his room.
How did he crawl out...

1079
01:15:21,792 --> 01:15:24,833
That's how it works, Ganesh.

1080
01:15:26,542 --> 01:15:28,458
Leena is a champion player too!

1081
01:15:28,875 --> 01:15:31,792
Yesterday, complimented me in English.

1082
01:15:32,042 --> 01:15:36,708
She told me,
"Ganesh, you're indispend-indispo--"

1083
01:15:36,708 --> 01:15:38,625
- Indispensable.
- Yeah, that's it.

1084
01:15:38,625 --> 01:15:41,042
Next time, call before you come.

1085
01:15:41,042 --> 01:15:42,500
I won't be coming again.

1086
01:15:42,500 --> 01:15:45,542
The regular delivery guy has gone home.
So I'm here.

1087
01:15:45,542 --> 01:15:49,250
- He'll return after the 10th--
- It's okay, hurry up.

1088
01:15:51,417 --> 01:15:55,208
Ma'am, I heard
that they shoot films here.

1089
01:15:55,208 --> 01:15:56,792
But this is a hotel.

1090
01:15:56,792 --> 01:15:59,042
You got the wrong information.
It's definitely a hotel.

1091
01:15:59,125 --> 01:16:02,708
I was wondering why
a shoot would need so many veggies--

1092
01:16:02,708 --> 01:16:05,375
You don't have to wonder.
You can go now.

1093
01:16:12,292 --> 01:16:13,292
Let's go.

1094
01:16:13,500 --> 01:16:14,875
Wait a minute.

1095
01:16:18,208 --> 01:16:19,583
Open up the back.

1096
01:16:25,667 --> 01:16:27,292
Are you looking for something?

1097
01:16:29,208 --> 01:16:31,542
No, nothing.
You may leave.

1098
01:16:36,417 --> 01:16:38,500
- Okay, move.
- Come on.

1099
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:43,333
Hurry up.

1100
01:16:46,375 --> 01:16:48,958
I introduced a new character
for her.

1101
01:16:48,958 --> 01:16:51,875
Added so many activities
to increase her visibility.

1102
01:16:51,875 --> 01:16:54,292
- And she was good.
- You shut up.

1103
01:16:54,792 --> 01:16:57,417
I did it all overnight
but what is the result?

1104
01:16:57,417 --> 01:16:59,792
Rubbish! What is the point?

1105
01:17:00,292 --> 01:17:01,375
What's this?

1106
01:17:02,292 --> 01:17:04,917
What else?
They're gorging on hilsa and prawn.

1107
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:07,958
Give me the wide frame
of the restaurant.

1108
01:17:11,542 --> 01:17:13,917
F--k, f--k, f--k!

1109
01:17:15,542 --> 01:17:18,750
You are absolutely worthless!

1110
01:17:19,708 --> 01:17:22,167
But they were right there...

1111
01:17:54,917 --> 01:18:01,667
Today's white turns black tomorrow

1112
01:18:01,958 --> 01:18:08,708
And the black turns grey day after

1113
01:18:09,083 --> 01:18:15,833
All that's good today has disappeared

1114
01:18:16,042 --> 01:18:22,792
I want to go back to yesterday

1115
01:18:23,125 --> 01:18:29,875
What is the puzzle of life trying to tell us?

1116
01:18:29,958 --> 01:18:37,292
What are these questions crawling all over us?

1117
01:18:37,292 --> 01:18:44,042
Come and witness our hidden past

1118
01:18:44,333 --> 01:18:51,417
Come and see us shaken to our core

1119
01:18:51,667 --> 01:18:58,333
They won't let us fly
They've clipped our wings

1120
01:18:58,458 --> 01:19:05,875
We must break free
Now that our back is against the wall

1121
01:19:06,042 --> 01:19:12,750
Whatever dangers life throws at us
With the burning rage inside us

1122
01:19:13,208 --> 01:19:20,292
With bruises and scars we face them

1123
01:19:20,292 --> 01:19:26,708
We're not turning back
Let the storm come

1124
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:33,750
The wraths of time
has made us shed tears of blood

1125
01:19:33,833 --> 01:19:40,583
Thinking about where we went wrong
What was our fault?

1126
01:19:40,750 --> 01:19:47,833
We are not allowed to cry
even if we have to pay life's price

1127
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:54,750
Come and witness our hidden past

1128
01:19:54,750 --> 01:20:02,125
Come and see us shaken to our core

1129
01:20:02,375 --> 01:20:08,542
They won't let us fly
They've clipped our wings

1130
01:20:09,167 --> 01:20:16,583
We must break free
Now that our back is against the wall

1131
01:20:44,250 --> 01:20:51,292
Come and witness our hidden past

1132
01:20:51,292 --> 01:20:58,625
Come and see us shaken to our core

1133
01:20:58,625 --> 01:21:05,292
They won't let us fly
They've clipped our wings

1134
01:21:05,417 --> 01:21:12,292
We must break free
Now that our back is against the wall

1135
01:21:12,292 --> 01:21:19,333
Come and witness our hidden past

1136
01:21:19,333 --> 01:21:26,667
Come and see us shaken to our core

1137
01:21:26,667 --> 01:21:33,333
They won't let us fly
They've clipped our wings

1138
01:21:33,458 --> 01:21:41,042
We must break free
Now that our back is against the wall

1139
01:21:50,250 --> 01:21:51,792
Any point going there?

1140
01:21:52,125 --> 01:21:53,750
Let's check, at least.

1141
01:21:55,458 --> 01:21:56,583
Let's go.

1142
01:22:03,958 --> 01:22:04,792
Hey, kid!

1143
01:22:04,875 --> 01:22:06,417
- What's up?
- Where's the police station?

1144
01:22:06,417 --> 01:22:09,250
- Police station?
- Don't you have one?

1145
01:22:09,250 --> 01:22:10,083
Of course, we do.

1146
01:22:10,083 --> 01:22:14,333
Go straight, take a left.
Then a right.

1147
01:22:14,333 --> 01:22:15,583
Thank you.

1148
01:22:33,417 --> 01:22:35,417
Come here.

1149
01:22:37,042 --> 01:22:38,417
There they are.
Come on!

1150
01:22:38,417 --> 01:22:41,125
Our Avik and Tista!

1151
01:22:41,125 --> 01:22:42,750
Nulo was right!

1152
01:22:42,917 --> 01:22:47,833
- They're so good-looking even in real life.
- Can I take a picture, sir?

1153
01:22:47,833 --> 01:22:49,250
Are you shooting here?

1154
01:22:49,250 --> 01:22:52,417
Obviously. Look at their clothes.
They're shooting in the village.

1155
01:22:52,417 --> 01:22:54,167
Will you eat something?

1156
01:22:54,167 --> 01:22:56,958
Pushpo, can you get some sweets?

1157
01:22:56,958 --> 01:22:59,000
Yes, I'll get them.

1158
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:05,250
Hey, it's going to start soon.
Let's watch it with them.

1159
01:23:05,250 --> 01:23:06,375
Yes, let's!

1160
01:23:06,375 --> 01:23:08,292
Ask them if they have time.

1161
01:23:08,292 --> 01:23:11,333
Yes, they do.
Today is our lucky day!

1162
01:23:11,333 --> 01:23:13,250
- You both come with us.
- Yes, yes.

1163
01:23:23,375 --> 01:23:25,333
This is so incredible!

1164
01:23:25,333 --> 01:23:27,083
Hey, someone take a photo.

1165
01:23:27,083 --> 01:23:29,292
They're watching it with us!

1166
01:23:29,292 --> 01:23:31,500
Take my photo too.

1167
01:23:31,583 --> 01:23:33,792
It has started!

1168
01:23:38,333 --> 01:23:39,583
AVIK

1169
01:23:42,625 --> 01:23:43,917
TISTA

1170
01:23:49,125 --> 01:23:52,042
'FIRST DATES'
EPISODE 49

1171
01:24:13,417 --> 01:24:15,042
Hello?
What's going on?

1172
01:24:15,625 --> 01:24:17,625
- What?
- Why are you staring?

1173
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:19,583
Just like that.

1174
01:24:19,583 --> 01:24:20,792
What do you mean?
Let me see.

1175
01:24:20,792 --> 01:24:22,083
- No, no, no...
- Let me see...

1176
01:24:23,958 --> 01:24:26,708
You can't draw without asking.

1177
01:24:26,708 --> 01:24:29,208
Did you ask for my permission?

1178
01:24:29,583 --> 01:24:31,042
Really? Why?

1179
01:24:31,042 --> 01:24:36,583
Amitabh Bachchan appears in front
of his waiting fans every Sunday.

1180
01:24:36,625 --> 01:24:38,542
So many people take his photo,
sketch him...

1181
01:24:38,542 --> 01:24:40,708
Am I Amitabh Bachchan?

1182
01:24:40,833 --> 01:24:43,875
You're not, right?
Then where's the problem?

1183
01:24:44,583 --> 01:24:46,625
Please take a seat.
It won't take me long.

1184
01:24:46,667 --> 01:24:48,083
Ma'am, should I serve this here?

1185
01:24:48,792 --> 01:24:51,000
Please do and pull the chair up.

1186
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,583
Madam will sit. Please...

1187
01:24:55,042 --> 01:24:58,208
If you stay angry
the mood of the drawing will change.

1188
01:24:58,333 --> 01:24:59,333
That won't be nice.

1189
01:24:59,333 --> 01:25:00,875
Please have your eggs.

1190
01:25:02,125 --> 01:25:04,750
They might hatch
if you leave them for too long.

1191
01:25:05,125 --> 01:25:07,167
Are you a professional artist?

1192
01:25:07,625 --> 01:25:09,583
I'm...

1193
01:25:13,167 --> 01:25:15,250
a tissue paper artist.

1194
01:25:18,417 --> 01:25:21,000
I'm not asking for your consent.
You can keep that.

1195
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,042
If you don't like it,
you can use it and throw it away.

1196
01:25:23,250 --> 01:25:25,417
- I thought you were doing it for yourself...
- No, no.

1197
01:25:25,625 --> 01:25:27,708
Your face is now imprinted
on my brain.

1198
01:25:27,750 --> 01:25:30,250
That won't be erased.

1199
01:25:31,125 --> 01:25:32,917
Can we sit outside?

1200
01:25:32,917 --> 01:25:36,417
So many eggs around...
Seems like we're in a chicken farm.

1201
01:25:36,417 --> 01:25:37,667
Chicken...

1202
01:25:38,708 --> 01:25:40,333
We have to leave.

1203
01:25:40,333 --> 01:25:42,417
They wanted to go
to the police station.

1204
01:25:42,417 --> 01:25:44,458
Police staion?
Why?

1205
01:25:44,542 --> 01:25:46,125
Is everything alright?

1206
01:25:46,917 --> 01:25:48,250
Yes, everything's alright.

1207
01:25:48,833 --> 01:25:51,917
First, we need to return
to the hotel once.

1208
01:25:52,167 --> 01:25:53,375
Hotel?

1209
01:25:53,833 --> 01:25:56,292
It's where they're staying
for the shoot.

1210
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:58,333
Am I right?

1211
01:25:58,917 --> 01:26:00,625
Can you arrange for a car?

1212
01:26:00,625 --> 01:26:01,583
Certainly.

1213
01:26:08,375 --> 01:26:10,458
Chicken farmer and assassin.

1214
01:26:10,833 --> 01:26:12,750
That can be a great love story.

1215
01:26:36,583 --> 01:26:37,917
Welcome back.

1216
01:26:38,583 --> 01:26:40,500
What have you done to us?

1217
01:26:42,875 --> 01:26:45,042
Gifted you new lives.

1218
01:26:46,833 --> 01:26:50,667
Turned you into superstars overnight.

1219
01:26:51,750 --> 01:26:55,500
I'm sure you've understood that
in the last few hours.

1220
01:26:55,500 --> 01:26:57,500
But who gave you the right?

1221
01:26:59,125 --> 01:27:00,292
You did.

1222
01:27:06,167 --> 01:27:07,625
Come with me.

1223
01:27:08,958 --> 01:27:09,833
Come.

1224
01:27:36,333 --> 01:27:41,083
For a long time...
I was looking for people like you.

1225
01:27:41,542 --> 01:27:43,458
Why couldn't you just get two actors?

1226
01:27:43,833 --> 01:27:45,875
Why did you have to do all this?

1227
01:27:47,042 --> 01:27:49,083
Actors?

1228
01:27:49,958 --> 01:27:52,417
Acting means to forget yourself.

1229
01:27:53,458 --> 01:27:56,625
But no one can forget themselves
once the camera is on.

1230
01:27:57,500 --> 01:27:58,750
But this is wrong.

1231
01:27:59,458 --> 01:28:03,292
You have pushed us into a fake world
without our knowledge.

1232
01:28:04,042 --> 01:28:07,333
Children believe
what their parents tell them.

1233
01:28:07,583 --> 01:28:09,500
They never question them.

1234
01:28:10,167 --> 01:28:12,375
This rock is God.
Worship it.

1235
01:28:12,417 --> 01:28:15,125
Eat this animal but not that one.

1236
01:28:15,125 --> 01:28:18,667
History books label some people as good
and some as bad.

1237
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,333
Do we ever challenge it?

1238
01:28:21,708 --> 01:28:24,708
The Mahabharata's Arjuna who fooled everyone
was hailed a superhero...

1239
01:28:24,708 --> 01:28:28,125
and Karna, who was always wronged,
was a supervillain.

1240
01:28:28,375 --> 01:28:31,875
We are being hypnotised
from the moment we are born.

1241
01:28:32,417 --> 01:28:36,250
The world around us is as doctored
as the world around you.

1242
01:28:36,333 --> 01:28:40,000
We will go outside
and create our own world.

1243
01:28:40,917 --> 01:28:43,000
"We" who?

1244
01:28:43,542 --> 01:28:45,458
Abhishek and Taposhi?

1245
01:28:45,667 --> 01:28:47,583
Abhiroop and Tripti?

1246
01:28:47,958 --> 01:28:49,875
Or is it Abhijit and Trina?

1247
01:28:50,833 --> 01:28:52,542
Who are you?

1248
01:29:15,333 --> 01:29:17,250
You guys need to know.

1249
01:29:17,625 --> 01:29:19,792
What happened 10 years back...

1250
01:29:20,375 --> 01:29:22,708
when destiny brought you two together.

1251
01:29:27,583 --> 01:29:29,917
It was May 22nd, 2010.

1252
01:29:30,542 --> 01:29:33,167
The Mangalore-bound
Air India Express flight from Dubai...

1253
01:29:33,750 --> 01:29:35,875
...was just about to take off.

1254
01:29:38,125 --> 01:29:41,542
All passengers are requested
to keep their seatbelts fastened...

1255
01:29:41,667 --> 01:29:43,958
and not to open the overhead bins.

1256
01:29:44,208 --> 01:29:48,417
All passengers are requested
to keep their seatbelts fastened...

1257
01:29:48,458 --> 01:29:51,042
and not to open the overhead bins.

1258
01:29:51,208 --> 01:29:53,625
Cabin crew take your seats for take off.

1259
01:30:08,167 --> 01:30:09,417
Excuse me?

1260
01:30:09,750 --> 01:30:11,042
Excuse me?

1261
01:30:11,417 --> 01:30:12,208
Hi!

1262
01:30:13,042 --> 01:30:14,000
Hello.

1263
01:30:15,375 --> 01:30:16,583
You want the newspaper?

1264
01:30:16,583 --> 01:30:17,417
No, no...

1265
01:30:18,583 --> 01:30:19,750
You're a Bengali?

1266
01:30:19,750 --> 01:30:20,625
You too?

1267
01:30:20,667 --> 01:30:21,542
Great!

1268
01:30:24,458 --> 01:30:26,375
Actually, I...

1269
01:30:26,542 --> 01:30:28,708
feel a little scared
on an aeroplane.

1270
01:30:28,833 --> 01:30:29,958
That's no big deal.

1271
01:30:30,250 --> 01:30:33,375
At least 30% of the people
on this flight are scared.

1272
01:30:33,417 --> 01:30:35,417
And 10% are very anxious.

1273
01:30:36,083 --> 01:30:37,333
How did you know?

1274
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:42,083
I'm a commerce graduate
but studied statistics in school.

1275
01:30:42,333 --> 01:30:45,292
Let me also tell you that the chances
of this flight crashing are...

1276
01:30:45,292 --> 01:30:46,750
One in 11 million.

1277
01:30:47,042 --> 01:30:47,958
Really?

1278
01:30:48,458 --> 01:30:49,667
I had no idea.

1279
01:30:49,750 --> 01:30:52,833
No one here looks nervous.

1280
01:30:53,750 --> 01:30:55,417
Because they're all good actors.

1281
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:57,917
Do you mean to say
I'm a poor actor?

1282
01:30:57,917 --> 01:30:59,958
No.
You don't look nervous either.

1283
01:31:00,292 --> 01:31:02,292
It seems like you're happily returning home.

1284
01:31:02,958 --> 01:31:04,083
That's actually true.

1285
01:31:04,083 --> 01:31:05,375
You're a complete psychic!

1286
01:31:05,583 --> 01:31:07,792
- Avik.
- Tista.

1287
01:31:14,208 --> 01:31:16,125
That means you sing well.

1288
01:31:16,375 --> 01:31:19,208
I'd sing for you but this venue is...

1289
01:31:21,042 --> 01:31:21,958
not ideal.

1290
01:31:21,958 --> 01:31:24,208
I'm not even sure I'll play cricket
for a living.

1291
01:31:24,250 --> 01:31:26,042
One day you'll play for India.

1292
01:31:26,042 --> 01:31:27,667
Mark the words of this psychic.

1293
01:31:28,458 --> 01:31:29,958
You can draw as well?

1294
01:31:30,167 --> 01:31:32,333
Your sketch would be here.

1295
01:31:32,458 --> 01:31:35,125
I had walked once on the ramp in college.

1296
01:31:35,417 --> 01:31:36,833
It was quite painful.

1297
01:31:36,917 --> 01:31:39,292
Beauty and poetry are born
out of pain.

1298
01:31:39,292 --> 01:31:41,208
Their glory, our gain.

1299
01:31:41,417 --> 01:31:43,208
Good morning, ladies
and gentlemen.

1300
01:31:43,292 --> 01:31:46,708
In a few minutes,
we're going to start our decent towards Mangalore.

1301
01:31:46,750 --> 01:31:47,583
We're running on time...

1302
01:31:47,708 --> 01:31:49,167
- You're a magician!
- What did I do?

1303
01:31:49,167 --> 01:31:50,125
- You're a magician!
- What did I do?

1304
01:31:50,208 --> 01:31:55,083
You made me forget
we've been flying all this while.

1305
01:31:56,917 --> 01:32:00,167
Sometimes, if we have the right company,
our life also becomes a smooth ride.

1306
01:32:00,750 --> 01:32:03,125
Is this a statistical fact too?

1307
01:32:04,750 --> 01:32:08,125
These things
are beyond science and statistics.

1308
01:32:09,750 --> 01:32:12,250
Only the heart knows
how the heart feels.

1309
01:32:21,917 --> 01:32:22,917
Oh, fish!

1310
01:32:23,375 --> 01:32:24,458
We're nearly there.

1311
01:32:24,750 --> 01:32:26,750
I don't count my chickens
before they hatch.

1312
01:32:27,708 --> 01:32:29,625
You only have to act again.

1313
01:32:29,750 --> 01:32:31,250
I can't do this.

1314
01:32:33,417 --> 01:32:34,375
Look at me.

1315
01:32:35,500 --> 01:32:36,583
Look at me!

1316
01:32:38,167 --> 01:32:39,458
You're not alone.

1317
01:32:40,042 --> 01:32:41,583
I'm here with you.

1318
01:32:43,083 --> 01:32:45,667
We are in this together.

1319
01:32:47,458 --> 01:32:50,917
That's for today.
What about next time?

1320
01:32:53,208 --> 01:32:55,292
If we want, not just for today...

1321
01:32:55,917 --> 01:32:58,583
But even tomorrow...
and day after...

1322
01:32:59,375 --> 01:33:01,542
We can always be around
for each other.

1323
01:33:37,167 --> 01:33:38,500
- Please sit down. Please take your seat.
- Please sit down.

1324
01:33:38,500 --> 01:33:40,292
- Please sit down.
- Please don't stand up.

1325
01:33:40,292 --> 01:33:42,625
- Please listen to us.
- Sit down, please.

1326
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,083
- Don't panic. Everything's fine.
- Please sit down, don't stand up.

1327
01:33:46,083 --> 01:33:47,292
Give me your hand.

1328
01:33:48,500 --> 01:33:49,917
Give me your hand!

1329
01:33:59,833 --> 01:34:01,667
Even if the landing went fine...

1330
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,292
the pilot had overshot the runway
by mistake...

1331
01:34:05,333 --> 01:34:08,167
The aircraft rolled off
the cliff and...

1332
01:34:08,625 --> 01:34:10,875
it immediately caught fire.

1333
01:34:11,292 --> 01:34:15,083
Out of 160 passengers
and six crew members, only...

1334
01:34:15,417 --> 01:34:17,375
eight survived.

1335
01:34:18,625 --> 01:34:21,167
And of those eight...

1336
01:34:22,125 --> 01:34:24,625
two people lost their memory.

1337
01:34:28,667 --> 01:34:31,375
Both of you had refused me
at first.

1338
01:34:31,500 --> 01:34:33,750
You in Mangalore.
You in Delhi.

1339
01:34:34,625 --> 01:34:38,375
You both believed
that you would get back your memory.

1340
01:34:39,833 --> 01:34:41,167
But then...

1341
01:34:41,500 --> 01:34:43,292
after quite a few years...

1342
01:34:44,625 --> 01:34:46,333
you guys agreed.

1343
01:34:47,583 --> 01:34:51,083
And I finally got my two actors...

1344
01:34:51,833 --> 01:34:54,292
who don't even remember themselves.

1345
01:34:57,958 --> 01:35:01,292
But I won't stop you anymore.

1346
01:35:03,542 --> 01:35:05,792
But when this hypnosis wears off...

1347
01:35:06,833 --> 01:35:09,125
you will not remember
who you are.

1348
01:35:09,667 --> 01:35:12,042
You will not remember each other.

1349
01:35:14,708 --> 01:35:16,958
When you'd gained consciousness
after the crash...

1350
01:35:16,958 --> 01:35:20,500
you'll be in that helpless,
lost state.

1351
01:35:23,625 --> 01:35:24,792
But...

1352
01:35:26,917 --> 01:35:29,500
But if you choose to stay here...

1353
01:35:31,417 --> 01:35:33,667
you'll meet each other tomorrow...

1354
01:35:34,583 --> 01:35:36,500
as two new individuals.

1355
01:35:37,542 --> 01:35:39,292
You'll meet for sure.

1356
01:35:46,292 --> 01:35:49,458
But what if we don't feel anything
for each other tomorrow?

1357
01:35:50,458 --> 01:35:52,292
If we don't...

1358
01:35:53,042 --> 01:35:55,458
If we don't fall in love?

1359
01:35:57,083 --> 01:35:59,875
That hasn't happened yet.

1360
01:36:00,833 --> 01:36:03,417
No matter how you're brainwashed...

1361
01:36:04,625 --> 01:36:07,083
you always fall in love.

1362
01:36:07,083 --> 01:36:09,000
Every time.

1363
01:36:09,417 --> 01:36:11,333
Every day.

1364
01:36:17,333 --> 01:36:19,875
Think about what you'll do.

1365
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:23,417
All the best.

1366
01:37:05,542 --> 01:37:06,667
Give me your hand.

1367
01:37:08,542 --> 01:37:09,792
Give me your hand!

1368
01:38:05,792 --> 01:38:07,375
Open Sesame?

1369
01:39:48,792 --> 01:39:51,000
Hi! Abhinandan.

1370
01:39:51,500 --> 01:39:52,708
My name is Torsha.

1371
01:39:53,417 --> 01:39:59,042
LOVE
NOW & FOREVER
