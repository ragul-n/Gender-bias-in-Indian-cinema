1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,792


3
00:01:20,083 --> 00:01:24,667
With the wind blowing strong

4
00:01:25,917 --> 00:01:32,042
Rising enmity make heads fall

5
00:01:32,208 --> 00:01:36,792
Life sometimes does cease

6
00:01:38,208 --> 00:01:49,125
Through day and night,
you protect us.

7
00:01:50,250 --> 00:02:01,167
You come in godly
forms, to guard us.

8
00:02:02,208 --> 00:02:07,000
Trees may collapse

9
00:02:08,625 --> 00:02:12,792
Seeds nurture life within

10
00:02:14,417 --> 00:02:23,500
Fall to rise and fight.

11
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:00,083
Through mornings
that never starts

12
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:03,500
Through days that never end

13
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:09,542
You toil ever persistent

14
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:15,375
There exists no state
Free of crimes till date

15
00:03:15,542 --> 00:03:19,875
Hunt them with a just view

16
00:03:22,167 --> 00:03:27,125
In your sleep...

17
00:03:33,708 --> 00:03:39,750
Vigilant even in your sleep

18
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:45,708
Your methods stay
when you are gone

19
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:51,250
Enormous works are done

20
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:57,292
No one can replace the force

21
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:40,750
Hey listen

22
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,833
Shut up

23
00:04:42,167 --> 00:04:42,667
Don't irritate

24
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:47,042
Had I married someone else
I would've been happier

25
00:04:47,292 --> 00:04:48,542
You keep quiet!

26
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:49,375
Don’t raise your voice

27
00:04:49,542 --> 00:04:51,333
- I know what to do
- What do you know?

28
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,042
- Don’t you...
- How dare...

29
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:56,542
Mind your own business. Don’t you
poke your nose into my business.

30
00:04:56,708 --> 00:05:01,167
- How dare you...
- Don't you dare lay your hands on me.

31
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,208
How dare you hit a woman?

32
00:05:07,542 --> 00:05:08,542
She is my wife

33
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,125
Will you hit her in a public
place if she is wife?

34
00:05:10,292 --> 00:05:11,458
Hey. Tell him!

35
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:12,792
He is my husband.

36
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,333
Keep all your arguments at home.

37
00:05:14,708 --> 00:05:15,792
I'll have you arrested.

38
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:18,167
Why are you here? Hey you!

39
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:21,167
Where are you going?

40
00:05:35,667 --> 00:05:37,000
Easy! You hurt me!

41
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,375
Tell me.

42
00:05:40,417 --> 00:05:41,292
Where are you?

43
00:05:42,042 --> 00:05:43,625
Don't harm him. Leave him.

44
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,917
It's over.

45
00:05:46,917 --> 00:05:47,917
- Leave the place.
- Yes

46
00:05:48,542 --> 00:05:49,833
Come on. Let's leave.

47
00:06:31,417 --> 00:06:32,708
Listen to me.

48
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,417
If I could do anything, I wouldn't
have let you talk this much.

49
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:36,375
Just a moment

50
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,500
Go now.

51
00:06:46,417 --> 00:06:47,667
Its beyond my control

52
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:49,458
How many times have I told you?

53
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:53,000
You burnt him there as though you
couldn't find a better place.

54
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:55,500
All that is fine.

55
00:06:55,917 --> 00:06:57,333
He was lying dead after
the bridge, isn't it?

56
00:06:57,917 --> 00:06:59,500
If it is after the bridge, it
is not under my jurisdiction.

57
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,250
C4 Station

58
00:07:06,667 --> 00:07:07,417
Sethupathi

59
00:07:09,917 --> 00:07:11,125
He is a psycho

60
00:07:11,708 --> 00:07:13,167
No one can win an
argument with him

61
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:17,042
He is even worse now as he is
awaiting his ACP promotion.

62
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:19,583
No. That's not possible.

63
00:07:20,667 --> 00:07:23,792
Try talking to him. You will
have your jaw thrashed.

64
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:40,375
Come on!

65
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:50,708
Oh my!

66
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,625
Ouch!

67
00:07:57,958 --> 00:07:59,583
Ammu save daddy!

68
00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:05,458
- Ammu save daddy!
- Hey stop hitting my dad!

69
00:08:07,917 --> 00:08:10,167
Ammu, hit him. Hit him hard.

70
00:08:14,292 --> 00:08:15,792
Can I take some rest, please?

71
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,292
- Are you ready?
- Yes!

72
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:37,583
Ammu, hit him.

73
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:40,292
Don't spare him.

74
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:43,917
Yes. Tell me.

75
00:08:44,167 --> 00:08:44,667
Sir!

76
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:47,583
The hospital... hosp...

77
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:52,292
Ammu save me.

78
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:54,542
- You go on.
- Ammu save me

79
00:08:56,417 --> 00:08:57,250
You go ahead man!

80
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,250
I came to this hospital...

81
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:00,167
Ammu hit him.

82
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:05,750
- I will not leave you!
- I am not going to spare you!

83
00:09:05,792 --> 00:09:07,083
The hospital... postmortem...

84
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:08,708
Wait. You go ahead.

85
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,708
You go ahead man!

86
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:14,708
I came to the hospital to get the postmortem
report. We can get it if you come.

87
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:16,667
Nothing else. I am
hanging up sir!

88
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:17,708
Ok. I'll come.

89
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:20,250
Come on now.

90
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,000
Hit him ammu.

91
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:26,375
If anyone blurts out in pain,
then you will know me!

92
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:29,708
Get hold of her. Save me dear!

93
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:32,875
Don't hit the kids.
Just come and join us.

94
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:35,625
- I need to pack the clothes
- Leave it and join us.

95
00:09:35,792 --> 00:09:39,833
- Wait wait.
- I'll join. Wait.

96
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:46,333
Why can't you all be quiet?

97
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:47,333
Hey! Come on.

98
00:09:47,667 --> 00:09:51,083
Leave this place.

99
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:52,167
Leave.

100
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:55,083
- Stop.
- Call the doctor.

101
00:09:55,750 --> 00:10:00,125
- Call the doctor. - Ask the doctor
to come out. We'll talk to him

102
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:03,333
He showed his attitude,
now let me show mine.

103
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:10,583
- Keep quiet - Why should we be
quiet? Call the doctor immediately.

104
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:12,083
The inspector is inside.
Please be quiet for a while.

105
00:10:12,167 --> 00:10:13,958
Do you think we are
scared of cops?

106
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:16,292
Call the doctor immediately.

107
00:10:16,417 --> 00:10:19,792
They'll kill you if you go inside.
Come out now.

108
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:21,792
They have stabbed
him at 17 spots.

109
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:23,708
They have burnt him after that.

110
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:25,875
May be petrol or something

111
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:28,875
Hey Doctor! Come outside.

112
00:10:29,167 --> 00:10:31,875
- I am calling out to you.
- All other details will be in the report.

113
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:34,708
You can get it this evening
or tomorrow morning.

114
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:37,708
I'll get the reports
tomorrow morning.

115
00:10:37,792 --> 00:10:40,708
If you can tell me the details,
I can start the investigation.

116
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:44,042
I've been on duty all night.
I am very tired.

117
00:10:44,042 --> 00:10:47,250
The victim is a cop.
Please try to understand.

118
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:49,375
Don't you understand
what I am saying.

119
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:53,583
I've been awake the whole night. I
am very tired and need some sleep.

120
00:10:53,917 --> 00:10:55,667
What more do you
expect me to say?

121
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:57,417
Hey! What's the noise there?

122
00:10:58,083 --> 00:10:59,833
Go check out, Idiot.

123
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:05,458
You can sleep after an hour.
Give me the details now.

124
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:11,083
There is a two inch
deep cut on his chest.

125
00:11:11,542 --> 00:11:16,542
Do you think we are scared of the cops?
Ask him to come out now!

126
00:11:18,417 --> 00:11:23,792
Run! Run! Let's run!

127
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,500
Thrash them!

128
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:52,167
- Oh my God! Spare me please
- Get lost now!

129
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,625
Sorry doctor. Tell me now.

130
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:15,042
This is where they had
planned the murder.

131
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:17,542
The evidences are empty alcohol
bottles, cigarette butts... Sir!

132
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:19,375
It's a pit.

133
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:22,292
Where are the evidences?

134
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,208
In the car.

135
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:25,000
- Where is the car?
- Its there.

136
00:12:25,917 --> 00:12:26,583
I'll go fetch them.

137
00:12:27,042 --> 00:12:29,000
- That's fine. We'll take a look
at them in the car. - Yes Sir!

138
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:35,958
The post postmortem report says
that 3 people had stabbed him.

139
00:12:36,042 --> 00:12:37,542
It matches with our
evidence as well.

140
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:39,250
- Is it?
- Yes sir.

141
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:41,042
What about the one who
threw the bottle?

142
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:44,750
- So its 4 men.
- What about the one who bought the bottle?

143
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:47,583
Sorry! 5 men!

144
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:51,542
- What else have you found out in your
investigation? - I am still trying.

145
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:53,833
- Can you inform me when you
find something? - Sure sir!

146
00:13:02,167 --> 00:13:02,833
Move aside.

147
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:06,417
- Who is the witness?
- Sir this... Hey come here.

148
00:13:08,542 --> 00:13:09,250
Tell him.

149
00:13:09,542 --> 00:13:11,667
- Did you see it first?
- Yes sir. It's me.

150
00:13:11,917 --> 00:13:13,958
I saw something burning on my
way to work in the morning.

151
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:15,333
I went near and
there was a stench.

152
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:16,833
I informed the cops immediately.

153
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:19,125
That's all. I do not
know anything else.

154
00:13:19,417 --> 00:13:21,333
- Ok. Leave.
- Ok

155
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:27,458
- Don't let anyone inside.
- Where was the vehicle?

156
00:13:28,042 --> 00:13:29,000
It was lying there.

157
00:13:30,417 --> 00:13:31,625
Was it lying or was it parked?

158
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:34,333
It was parked on its side stand.

159
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:39,458
There is no need for the
vehicle to be parked here.

160
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:41,750
Muruganandham.

161
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,667
(Yawning) Yes sir!

162
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,042
- Do one thing.
- Tell me sir.

163
00:13:46,417 --> 00:13:48,625
- Go have a strong tea first.
- Ok

164
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:50,125
After you have your tea...

165
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,625
Find out who all went this way for work, people who
left the village or came to the village as well.

166
00:13:56,292 --> 00:13:57,917
Take care. Take your time.

167
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:01,417
Make it fast.

168
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:12,875
Sub Inspector Subburaj has been
murdered by unidentified men.

169
00:14:13,042 --> 00:14:15,417
The motive of the murder
is still unknown.

170
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:17,125
The police is
investigating the murder.

171
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:22,000
A fear has gripped the public as such
an incident has happened to a cop.

172
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:25,625
It is said that he was
stabbed before being burnt.

173
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:27,125
I've inquired in the village.

174
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:31,083
There are no negative remarks about him.
Everyone vouched for his character.

175
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:34,000
He was lying in his house
as it was off duty for him

176
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:38,167
His wife was lamenting that he lost his
life as he substituted the duty of the SI.

177
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:42,708
Hence I couldn't inquire more. I'll inquire
and give you the details in two days.

178
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:51,292
- Tell me Murthy.
- I inquired with the mill watchman.

179
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:54,750
He says that a husband
and wife went this way.

180
00:14:55,292 --> 00:14:57,917
He was not able to identify them. But he was
sure that they are not from the village.

181
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:00,917
Find out who they are.

182
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:28,417
Are you going to tell me or not?

183
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:31,750
Don't keep repeating
what you've said.

184
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:34,000
You tell me. Do you know or not?

185
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:42,208
- Sir.
- Ask them to come.

186
00:15:43,167 --> 00:15:44,792
Keep the sentry book here.

187
00:15:52,042 --> 00:15:53,583
- Come in.
- Greetings.

188
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:55,500
Tell me.

189
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,958
My wife is missing.

190
00:15:57,667 --> 00:15:59,167
She always quarrels with me.

191
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:02,792
The other day, she ran away
throwing away her mangalsutra.

192
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:05,500
- I am sure she has an illegal affair.
- Hey!

193
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:09,625
- What is your name?
- Praisika.

194
00:16:09,917 --> 00:16:12,333
- What grade are you studying in Praisika?
- Sixth grade.

195
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:15,958
Your mom will be back soon. Please wait
outside and your dad will join you soon.

196
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:22,750
- How long has she been missing?
- Its been four days.

197
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:25,042
- What were you doing these four days?
- Searching for her.

198
00:16:25,792 --> 00:16:27,375
I am sure she has
an illegal affair.

199
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:30,542
Don't blame a woman
unnecessarily.

200
00:16:31,417 --> 00:16:33,458
Give a written complaint.
I'll look into it.

201
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:35,625
- Go now.
- Ok sir.

202
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:38,375
Murthy. Arrange the roll call.

203
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:43,625
Shall I write as wife missing,
illegal affair suspected?

204
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:46,375
Just write as wife missing.

205
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:51,458
Get ready for the roll call.

206
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:04,208
Who is on court duty today?

207
00:17:04,792 --> 00:17:05,583
Manickam.

208
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:08,208
- Ezhumalai.
- Yes sir.

209
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:10,125
Did you eat? - Yes sir.

210
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:12,917
Haven't I told you not to take the walkie
talkie without noting it in the sentry book?

211
00:17:13,292 --> 00:17:13,792
Sorry sir.

212
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:16,083
Make the entry.

213
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,042
Who went to Anuppanedi to
check drunken driving?

214
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,875
Were you the only one?

215
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:28,750
Are you not ashamed of hiding
at wine shops to get cases?

216
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:33,792
They have snatched my chain.

217
00:17:34,292 --> 00:17:36,083
- Madam
- What happened?

218
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:36,875
Who was it?

219
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:38,500
Never disturb the
public unnecessarily.

220
00:17:38,542 --> 00:17:40,542
They snatched it.

221
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:44,125
What happened?

222
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,625
I don't know who it was.

223
00:17:45,708 --> 00:17:46,875
You are bleeding. Take
her to the hospital.

224
00:17:46,917 --> 00:17:49,083
- No sir. I want my chain.
- You will get your chain.

225
00:17:49,167 --> 00:17:51,583
- Take her to the doctor first.
- Please come.

226
00:17:52,292 --> 00:17:54,000
Its paining!

227
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,208
Murthy

228
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:04,083
- Inquire about the chain
snatching case first. - Yes Sir.

229
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,958
I have to go to the SP office.

230
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:07,792
Ask Moses to keep
Subburaj's file ready.

231
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:08,708
Ok sir.

232
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:10,208
- Murthy
- Sir

233
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:12,083
He will say that the
Writer is on leave.

234
00:18:12,583 --> 00:18:14,917
The Writer is on leave.

235
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:17,833
He knows that, it seems. He
asked you to fetch it.

236
00:18:18,167 --> 00:18:20,667
- Did he say that?
- Yes!

237
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:26,583
I wonder where he has
placed the file.

238
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:31,958
The file will not come to us, we
need to go in search of the file.

239
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,000
- Did he say that too?
- I swear!

240
00:18:34,542 --> 00:18:36,792
Did he ask you to say this
when I start searching for it?

241
00:18:37,958 --> 00:18:40,875
- You will soon become the inspector!
- Thanks!

242
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:51,875
Get ready with the vehicle.

243
00:18:52,917 --> 00:18:53,417
Murthy.

244
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:56,333
Is the file ready?

245
00:18:56,542 --> 00:18:57,708
We are searching for it.

246
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:01,833
- I'll go to the SP office. Take your time and search.
- Yes sir.

247
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:10,083
Here it is. Before he can
shout at you, hand it to him.

248
00:19:10,417 --> 00:19:12,333
Go and hand it over.

249
00:19:39,417 --> 00:19:39,917
Hey

250
00:19:40,667 --> 00:19:41,167
Maaran

251
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:42,708
Daddy...

252
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:47,000
Hey Ammu. What are
you doing here?

253
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:50,208
What happened darling?

254
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:53,708
Mom and brother are hiding.
I have to find them.

255
00:19:54,167 --> 00:19:56,292
Is it? Shall we find them?

256
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:57,792
Come.

257
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:08,625
Ammu

258
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,250
I'll go and find mom.

259
00:20:12,792 --> 00:20:15,750
- You go inside and look for brother.
- Ok

260
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:40,500
What dear?

261
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:42,792
You seem to be scared of cops

262
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:44,500
I am not scared

263
00:20:46,667 --> 00:20:47,583
Are you hiding?

264
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:49,542
You have found me now.

265
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:53,208
I haven't found you yet.

266
00:20:56,417 --> 00:20:57,958
Enough of finding me. I am leaving.

267
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:01,417
You are out of the game only when I
find you. I have not found you yet!

268
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:04,917
The kids will be here anytime.

269
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:07,042
We'll take care when they come.

270
00:21:07,292 --> 00:21:09,917
- Hey cop!
- Yes dear!

271
00:21:10,042 --> 00:21:11,917
You are making a mistake
and you will pay for it.

272
00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:14,417
Let's do the mistake first. I'll
take care of the paying part!

273
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,250
Let's find where mom is.

274
00:21:20,792 --> 00:21:23,708
- Hey! Mom is out. Mom is out.
- Yes! Mom is out.

275
00:21:24,042 --> 00:21:25,250
Yes! Mom is out.

276
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:27,792
Don't worry. Let's
play another game.

277
00:21:28,542 --> 00:21:31,792
- Shall we play another game?
- Yes. We are ready.

278
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:33,292
No no. Let's not
play another game.

279
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,417
- Hey. - Listen. Don't do
this in front of the kids.

280
00:21:35,625 --> 00:21:38,750
- Hey Maaran. Please ask mom to join the game.
- Mom. Let's play another game.

281
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:42,292
- Mom please.
- Go now.

282
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:44,208
Hey. Don't go guys.

283
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:45,792
Please dear.

284
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:49,167
Please curvy darling!

285
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:13,167
You bring color to my Khakis

286
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:17,708
You transform a cop to a thief

287
00:22:18,458 --> 00:22:23,083
With you by my side,
I have no sleep

288
00:22:23,583 --> 00:22:27,375
All my troubles dwindle away

289
00:22:27,792 --> 00:22:32,833
You make my world beautiful.

Gone with the time
Are our quarrels of that time

Till the end of eternity
You will be my love

Let’s enjoy and face the odds.

330
00:26:15,292 --> 00:26:16,542
- Hello
- Hey darling.

331
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:18,250
Yes. Tell me.

332
00:26:18,792 --> 00:26:19,417
Did you eat?

333
00:26:20,375 --> 00:26:22,208
Why didn't you pick your mobile?

334
00:26:22,792 --> 00:26:23,625
I don't know where I placed it.

335
00:26:24,292 --> 00:26:24,958
I didn’t hear it ring.

336
00:26:26,125 --> 00:26:28,042
Call your parents and
wish them after you eat.

337
00:26:28,542 --> 00:26:29,375
Why?

338
00:26:29,792 --> 00:26:31,000
Today is their
wedding anniversary.

339
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,333
- Oh my! I forgot. Bye bye.
- Ok.

340
00:26:34,625 --> 00:26:36,917
- Hey! Hello hello
- Yes.

341
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:41,208
- You too please wish them.
- I'll think about it.

342
00:26:41,958 --> 00:26:44,542
If not for my dad,
at least wish my mom.

343
00:26:44,875 --> 00:26:47,625
I am here for a case.
I'll finish this first.

344
00:26:48,792 --> 00:26:50,083
Thanks for coming.
Please take your seat.

345
00:26:50,708 --> 00:26:52,292
Two teas here.

346
00:26:56,333 --> 00:26:58,958
This is regarding SI Subburaj's case.

347
00:26:59,542 --> 00:27:04,208
I have a few doubts in that murder. I
wanted to meet you to discuss that.

348
00:27:05,083 --> 00:27:06,708
I am clear about three things of that case.

349
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,083
Firstly, he does not have any
official or personal enemies.

350
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:13,542
Secondly, this is a well planned murder.

351
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,375
Thirdly, Subburaj was off duty that day.

352
00:27:16,792 --> 00:27:18,625
It was Kanagavel who was
supposed to be there.

353
00:27:19,375 --> 00:27:21,458
What if Subburaj was killed
instead of Kanagavel?

354
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:27,792
If you can provide me details about
Kanagavel, I can proceed further.

355
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:32,792
Hold on. Who gave you the permission to
enter my station and browse the records?

356
00:27:33,292 --> 00:27:34,625
What right do you have?

357
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,500
I tried many times to reach you.
But I couldn't.

358
00:27:37,833 --> 00:27:41,042
How did you reach me now?

359
00:27:41,625 --> 00:27:42,958
You could have tried
the same way.

360
00:27:44,542 --> 00:27:47,625
- Sorry sir. Please leave that.
- Hold on!

361
00:27:47,792 --> 00:27:53,917
This isn't a soccer match to
kill someone instead of another.

362
00:27:54,417 --> 00:27:55,875
First investigate properly.

363
00:27:57,250 --> 00:28:01,875
What you said, looks like anyone with a cop's
attire would be been killed that night.

364
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:03,875
Make a move!

365
00:28:05,083 --> 00:28:06,375
He is the sub inspector
of your station.

366
00:28:06,792 --> 00:28:08,750
- If you don’t co-operate...
- I am telling you the same.

367
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,750
Why are you more worried
about it than us?

368
00:28:11,208 --> 00:28:15,958
You accept bribes and investigate
as a honest officer.

369
00:28:17,625 --> 00:28:19,667
- Wasting my time.
- Thank you.

370
00:28:22,083 --> 00:28:22,583
Hello

371
00:28:24,667 --> 00:28:27,167
Shall I enter your house when you are away?

372
00:28:27,833 --> 00:28:29,083
It feels the same for us too.

373
00:28:29,583 --> 00:28:32,708
You don't have an
answer to my question.

374
00:28:33,042 --> 00:28:35,167
Why should I answer
your questions?

375
00:28:35,708 --> 00:28:37,292
As though he is a big shot!

376
00:28:39,708 --> 00:28:41,708
What?

377
00:28:48,708 --> 00:28:50,333
Calm down. Please sit down.

378
00:28:57,250 --> 00:28:57,750
Sir tea.

379
00:29:04,875 --> 00:29:07,958
You haven't got the order
of becoming the ACP yet.

380
00:29:08,125 --> 00:29:13,125
With all these incidents, I can
easily stop your promotion.

381
00:29:13,292 --> 00:29:17,792
- I can't work considering...
- What are you trying to say? How can you hit an Inspector?

382
00:29:18,167 --> 00:29:21,875
- He didn't co-operate with me.
- What results have you got?

383
00:29:22,375 --> 00:29:23,542
Should I speak up or not?

384
00:29:25,833 --> 00:29:26,333
Tell me.

385
00:29:27,208 --> 00:29:30,417
To save Kanagavel, Subburaj has given
his life without his knowledge.

386
00:29:32,875 --> 00:29:33,542
Please take a look.

387
00:29:42,083 --> 00:29:43,625
I don't have any personal
vengeance against him.

388
00:29:44,167 --> 00:29:46,083
I am very sure that he is
also involved in this case.

389
00:29:46,708 --> 00:29:48,375
You inquire me for
hitting an inspector.

390
00:29:48,792 --> 00:29:50,625
It is because of him that the
wife of a cop is now a widow.

391
00:29:51,542 --> 00:29:52,750
What is your answer to them?

392
00:29:53,375 --> 00:29:54,750
That, your husband is dead?

393
00:29:55,208 --> 00:29:56,375
That, you can save on
the funeral expenses?

394
00:29:58,208 --> 00:30:00,333
We need to show them what happens
if they lay their hands on cops.

395
00:30:02,375 --> 00:30:04,083
I will not spare anyone
involved in this case.

396
00:30:11,625 --> 00:30:13,333
I cannot work for promotions.

397
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:24,250
Hey! What are you
still doing here?

398
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:25,458
Didn't I ask you to leave?

399
00:30:26,167 --> 00:30:27,250
Should I arrange a
farewell party?

400
00:30:27,917 --> 00:30:29,917
He has started digging deeper.

401
00:30:30,083 --> 00:30:33,792
Leave the place or I will
kill you and you child.

402
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:37,542
I am talking to you and...

403
00:31:11,125 --> 00:31:11,875
Sir! Sir!

404
00:31:15,792 --> 00:31:16,292
Sir

405
00:31:21,583 --> 00:31:22,417
Where are they?

406
00:31:37,333 --> 00:31:37,833
Sir!

407
00:31:38,875 --> 00:31:39,375
Are you fine?

408
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,375
I am alright sir!

409
00:31:52,917 --> 00:31:53,667
Oh my!

410
00:31:56,042 --> 00:31:57,750
Sir.. Sir...

411
00:32:04,917 --> 00:32:05,792
What are you doing here?

412
00:32:05,875 --> 00:32:07,250
Sir. Please go.

413
00:32:07,375 --> 00:32:10,583
I am acting as though am buying groceries.
Its a plan to catch them.

414
00:32:11,708 --> 00:32:12,208
Please go.

415
00:32:12,792 --> 00:32:15,083
I am on the run. Can you please
inform me, if you get hold of them?

416
00:32:15,208 --> 00:32:16,500
Sure sir!

417
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:34,917
Run! Cops!

418
00:34:29,083 --> 00:34:30,542
Please spare us.

419
00:34:30,792 --> 00:34:33,250
Please forgive us.
We'll not do it again.

420
00:34:36,958 --> 00:34:39,417
How dare you lay your hands
on a police officer?

421
00:34:39,542 --> 00:34:42,000
It was a mistake.
Please spare us.

422
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:44,417
Sorry sir.

423
00:34:44,458 --> 00:34:46,250
You mercilessly
burnt him alive...

424
00:34:46,292 --> 00:34:47,542
Sorry sir.

425
00:34:47,667 --> 00:34:48,458
...and now you ask forgiveness!

426
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:10,208
Sir. I'll tell you everything.

427
00:35:10,667 --> 00:35:12,375
I will tell you everything.

428
00:35:12,667 --> 00:35:15,042
I will tell you everything sir.

429
00:35:15,208 --> 00:35:16,417
I don't care to spare you.

430
00:35:17,167 --> 00:35:20,542
I will tell you everything.
Please save me.

431
00:35:20,708 --> 00:35:22,042
I will be killed if I
tell you anything.

432
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:23,708
Do you want to die now or
after a couple of days?

433
00:35:24,042 --> 00:35:25,333
You want security?

434
00:35:25,833 --> 00:35:26,542
Tell me the truth.

435
00:35:31,208 --> 00:35:31,958
Its Vaathiyar.

436
00:35:32,542 --> 00:35:36,583
Markets, travels, granite, real
estate, timber and other businesses.

437
00:35:36,917 --> 00:35:38,958
He controls the entire
central market.

438
00:35:39,583 --> 00:35:41,417
Nothing happens without
his knowledge.

439
00:35:41,833 --> 00:35:42,667
Not just that.

440
00:35:43,125 --> 00:35:45,958
No one dares to enter the Police
station without his permission.

441
00:35:46,417 --> 00:35:50,375
He is the force and he is the law.

442
00:35:53,125 --> 00:35:54,958
Greetings sir!

443
00:35:55,583 --> 00:35:56,375
Greetings!

444
00:35:57,750 --> 00:35:58,625
Sit down.

445
00:36:02,042 --> 00:36:04,042
Chelladurai wishes
to be the leader.

446
00:36:04,375 --> 00:36:05,250
Let's fulfill his wish.

447
00:36:06,167 --> 00:36:08,958
Listen Chelladurai. Becoming
the leader is not a big task.

448
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:11,667
But if hear anything
wrong about you..

449
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,583
That will be the end of it.

450
00:36:13,708 --> 00:36:14,708
Yes sir. Your blessings please.

451
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:19,000
Greetings.

452
00:36:23,958 --> 00:36:27,500
- I'll go to court.
- Oh! You are going to the court is it?

453
00:36:29,792 --> 00:36:33,250
Siblings issue. He is going
to the court it seems.

454
00:36:33,875 --> 00:36:35,083
Are you going to the court?

455
00:36:35,333 --> 00:36:36,750
No sir.

456
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,292
Just listen and follow what he says.

457
00:36:38,667 --> 00:36:40,542
Do you understand?
Have something and leave.

458
00:36:52,792 --> 00:36:53,917
Vaathiyar has a single daughter.

459
00:36:54,917 --> 00:36:59,083
As per her wishes, Vaathiyar did
not bother about the status...

460
00:36:59,375 --> 00:37:01,167
...and got her married to
sub inspector Kanagavel.

461
00:37:02,167 --> 00:37:04,083
She did not like
her life with him

462
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:09,042
Kanagavel was content with his earnings
and did not seek out to Vaathiyar.

463
00:37:10,042 --> 00:37:11,583
They quarreled everyday.

464
00:37:11,833 --> 00:37:13,792
I'll send people when I reach

465
00:37:13,958 --> 00:37:16,167
You better sign the divorce papers...

466
00:37:22,083 --> 00:37:23,042
Please call this off dad.

467
00:37:23,333 --> 00:37:29,333
Kanagavel did not sign the divorce papers
out of fear of losing his daughter.

468
00:37:29,958 --> 00:37:33,667
Vaathiyar mediated the issue
and Kanagavel did not respect him.

469
00:37:33,708 --> 00:37:34,500
What?

470
00:37:35,458 --> 00:37:38,167
Vaathiyar bore all
this for his daughter.

471
00:37:38,333 --> 00:37:40,958
This is how am
struggling everyday.

472
00:37:41,458 --> 00:37:43,375
Dad!!

473
00:37:44,375 --> 00:37:48,833
The quarrel kept aggravating and
one day Kanagavel hit his wife.

474
00:37:49,292 --> 00:37:52,292
She said that she would
no longer live with him.

475
00:37:52,875 --> 00:37:54,458
She wanted to be separated
from him permanently.

476
00:37:55,125 --> 00:37:59,042
She said that, to be peaceful she did
not even care if her husband was dead.

477
00:38:00,125 --> 00:38:01,625
Now that his daughter has said this...

478
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:06,917
Vaathiyar decided to finish off Kanagavel
without bothering about the consequences.

479
00:38:09,125 --> 00:38:10,583
The day they planned to murder Kanagavel...

480
00:38:11,292 --> 00:38:12,417
...he met with an accident.

481
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:14,625
So instead of him, Subburaj
was assigned for night duty.

482
00:38:15,042 --> 00:38:17,417
The contract killers mistook Subburaj
for Kanagavel...

483
00:38:17,917 --> 00:38:19,125
...and killed him.

484
00:38:19,667 --> 00:38:20,458
This is what happened.

485
00:38:21,542 --> 00:38:24,458
Let's take legal action.
Wait for the order.

486
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:26,000
- Ok?
- Yes Sir

487
00:38:56,750 --> 00:38:58,333
Mom had called.

488
00:39:00,167 --> 00:39:01,333
Pooja holidays are nearing.

489
00:39:01,542 --> 00:39:03,875
Mom wanted to see the kids.

490
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:05,875
The phone is ringing. Get it.

491
00:39:06,542 --> 00:39:07,333
Get me the phone.

492
00:39:13,667 --> 00:39:14,667
Switch it on and give it.

493
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:19,958
- Hello.
- Is it Mr.Sethu?

494
00:39:20,833 --> 00:39:21,708
Greetings sir.

495
00:39:22,083 --> 00:39:24,542
- I am Mathivaanan from Vaathiyar's house.
- Tell me what the matter is.

496
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:28,250
Nothing. Uncle wanted to talk to you.

497
00:39:28,708 --> 00:39:32,792
If you can give an appointment, Vaathiyar
would like to discuss with you in person.

498
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:36,208
It is something big that he
is coming down to meet you.

499
00:39:38,083 --> 00:39:38,583
Hello

500
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:44,750
He hung up.

501
00:39:46,417 --> 00:39:48,208
Mom had called.

502
00:39:48,542 --> 00:39:50,833
Tell me what the matter is. You've
been beating around the bush.

503
00:39:52,958 --> 00:39:55,250
She wanted to see all of
us and told us to visit.

504
00:39:55,583 --> 00:39:57,042
If you want you can go.
Why are you asking me?

505
00:39:57,875 --> 00:39:59,333
Did I talk so much to go alone?

506
00:39:59,583 --> 00:40:00,917
What do you want me to do?

507
00:40:01,167 --> 00:40:03,625
Dad is old. Why can't you
compromise with him?

508
00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:05,292
I am saying the same.

509
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:06,958
Your father has grown old.

510
00:40:07,708 --> 00:40:08,750
Why can't he compromise?

511
00:40:20,458 --> 00:40:20,958
Hey!

512
00:40:22,875 --> 00:40:23,667
Serve chutney.

513
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:25,708
Fatso!

514
00:40:33,125 --> 00:40:33,833
What?

515
00:40:34,667 --> 00:40:35,917
Will he fall in our line?

516
00:40:36,958 --> 00:40:39,000
Will he even have a choice?

517
00:40:39,375 --> 00:40:42,125
I'll meet him directly and seal the deal.
I'll meet you after that.

518
00:40:56,083 --> 00:40:57,667
Hey darling. How is it?

519
00:40:59,375 --> 00:40:59,875
Sir

520
00:41:00,333 --> 00:41:03,625
Mathivaanan from Vaathiyar's
house has come to meet you.

521
00:41:06,042 --> 00:41:07,375
Check if the fax machine
is switched on.

522
00:41:07,875 --> 00:41:09,958
Ok Sir. Mathivaanan...

523
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:15,500
I told you to check
the fax machine.

524
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:18,542
Hey darling.

525
00:41:18,917 --> 00:41:19,958
Sorry fatso!

526
00:41:20,083 --> 00:41:21,250
Here he is.

527
00:41:21,875 --> 00:41:22,667
Can we meet him?

528
00:41:23,292 --> 00:41:26,542
He is not in a good mood.
He is furious.

529
00:41:26,625 --> 00:41:28,208
It's getting late. I can't
explain things to uncle.

530
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:29,042
Moses.

531
00:41:34,167 --> 00:41:36,333
- Sir.
- What were you discussing, Moses?

532
00:41:36,792 --> 00:41:40,042
Nothing sir. They
are known to me.

533
00:41:40,333 --> 00:41:43,125
If they are known to you, why are
you chit chatting with them here?

534
00:41:44,458 --> 00:41:46,250
Keep your all your
relationships at your house.

535
00:41:47,833 --> 00:41:48,667
This is my station.

536
00:41:49,458 --> 00:41:50,792
Go now.

537
00:41:56,542 --> 00:41:57,042
Hey!

538
00:41:58,458 --> 00:42:00,333
- Fill all the details here.
- Hey Moses.

539
00:42:02,375 --> 00:42:02,958
Listen

540
00:42:06,792 --> 00:42:08,542
Hey! Won't you be quiet?

541
00:42:09,792 --> 00:42:11,500
I am going to thrash you!

542
00:42:28,958 --> 00:42:30,500
- When did you lose it?
- Last week.

543
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:31,833
- Murthy
- Sir

544
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:34,042
- Is the fax ready?
- Yes sir. We can leave.

545
00:42:34,083 --> 00:42:35,042
Hello sir. We've been waiting....

546
00:42:35,083 --> 00:42:38,292
Fill the address clearly.
We'll look into it.

547
00:42:40,458 --> 00:42:43,125
We know it. Won't we
inform you if we get it.

548
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:45,083
Inspector is leaving for a work.

549
00:42:46,208 --> 00:42:48,625
Sir. I've been
wanting to meet you.

550
00:42:49,042 --> 00:42:50,875
There is no information
about my chain.

551
00:42:51,125 --> 00:42:54,042
- Can you please help me?
- How long will you take?

552
00:42:54,625 --> 00:42:55,375
I am looking into it sir.

553
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:57,542
Do I have to
constantly follow up?

554
00:42:59,042 --> 00:42:59,708
Idiot.

555
00:43:00,750 --> 00:43:02,083
You will get your
chain in two days.

556
00:43:02,708 --> 00:43:04,792
Please leave now.

557
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:06,292
Trust us.

558
00:43:07,792 --> 00:43:08,542
Madam

559
00:43:08,833 --> 00:43:10,750
- Where did you say the incident happened?
- Near Ganesh theater

560
00:43:12,125 --> 00:43:12,792
Ok. Please leave.

561
00:43:15,708 --> 00:43:17,167
I am looking into it sir.

562
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:26,542
There is nothing
impossible for me here.

563
00:43:26,958 --> 00:43:28,125
This is just a small issue.

564
00:43:28,750 --> 00:43:30,625
The murder should've been neat.

565
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:31,958
A small mistake and...

566
00:43:32,375 --> 00:43:34,000
...today that guy is alive.

567
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:35,792
We'll see for how long that is.

568
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:38,875
Otherwise, I don't even know
the guy who was killed.

569
00:43:39,333 --> 00:43:42,042
What needs to be done for
his family will be done. Better than ever.

570
00:43:42,333 --> 00:43:44,250
What will the government do?

571
00:43:46,333 --> 00:43:47,042
Sir. It's ready.

572
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:50,875
Is it? Just a moment.

573
00:44:34,375 --> 00:44:36,917
Why haven't you had
the coffee yet?

574
00:44:37,167 --> 00:44:38,083
No, thanks sir.

575
00:44:41,958 --> 00:44:42,917
What was I saying?

576
00:44:44,667 --> 00:44:46,958
I don't even know the
guy who was killed.

577
00:44:47,292 --> 00:44:48,792
To the family of that guy...

578
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,375
...I will do what is required.
That's my responsibility.

579
00:44:50,917 --> 00:44:53,583
- Dad!
- Yes dear.

580
00:44:53,708 --> 00:44:56,250
- Send my kid. She will start crying out of hunger.
- Go and eat dear.

581
00:44:56,958 --> 00:45:00,958
Dear, he is the inspector
I told you about.

582
00:45:01,042 --> 00:45:02,208
Greetings.

583
00:45:04,125 --> 00:45:08,167
My glance is enough for my
guys to fulfill my orders.

584
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,667
But, shouldn't we respect you for having
respected our call and making it here.

585
00:45:12,917 --> 00:45:14,417
Please walk out from this case.

586
00:45:14,917 --> 00:45:16,542
I'll offer whatever
is required for that.

587
00:45:17,292 --> 00:45:20,125
Either ways is fine for me.
What do you say?

588
00:45:21,792 --> 00:45:23,167
Now you have to decide.

589
00:45:30,417 --> 00:45:30,917
Sir!

590
00:45:31,667 --> 00:45:34,000
Speak out one more word and you'll
hear all the foul language I know!

591
00:45:35,583 --> 00:45:38,333
Keep calm and board the vehicle.
Or else, I'll thrash and take you!

592
00:45:38,375 --> 00:45:40,167
What are you saying?

593
00:45:41,792 --> 00:45:44,000
How dare you?

594
00:45:51,208 --> 00:45:51,708
Murthy

595
00:45:58,208 --> 00:46:00,625
Who is this Police officer?

596
00:46:00,750 --> 00:46:02,958
He has dared to lay hands
on Vaathiyar himself.

597
00:46:03,375 --> 00:46:08,083
No one can even question him.

598
00:46:08,542 --> 00:46:14,542
He has been our strength.
Now he is being arrested.

599
00:46:17,167 --> 00:46:19,042
This cop shows a lot of attitude.

600
00:46:35,708 --> 00:46:36,208
Sir!

601
00:46:36,583 --> 00:46:37,083
Sir!

602
00:46:37,458 --> 00:46:39,667
Wait! Where are you going?

603
00:46:39,708 --> 00:46:41,042
- How long should we wait?
- He has just come.

604
00:46:41,208 --> 00:46:44,583
- Please inform him. How long should we wait?
- Please keep quiet.

605
00:46:46,125 --> 00:46:48,792
Please be seated.

606
00:46:58,458 --> 00:47:00,708
Uncle!

607
00:47:01,917 --> 00:47:03,333
Why are you here?

608
00:47:04,167 --> 00:47:04,917
Speak out uncle.

609
00:47:05,417 --> 00:47:07,292
Hey! Hey you!

610
00:47:07,833 --> 00:47:09,542
Sir is calling you. Come inside.

611
00:47:09,708 --> 00:47:11,792
I'll talk to him.

612
00:47:20,208 --> 00:47:21,583
- Sir
- Yes

613
00:47:21,750 --> 00:47:22,333
They are here.

614
00:47:24,125 --> 00:47:24,625
Tell me.

615
00:47:25,250 --> 00:47:27,833
I understand that you've been
waiting from morning. Tell me.

616
00:47:33,042 --> 00:47:34,250
Why are you guys blinking?

617
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,208
Tell me what the matter is.

618
00:47:39,333 --> 00:47:42,917
Murthy. They are staring at me and
its funny! Ask them to leave!

619
00:47:45,667 --> 00:47:47,042
Hey! Leave now.

620
00:47:47,625 --> 00:47:50,167
- Don't make me laugh.
- Go now.

621
00:47:55,208 --> 00:47:55,708
Uncle

622
00:47:59,833 --> 00:48:00,333
Uncle

623
00:48:01,250 --> 00:48:02,792
I can't stand this sight!

624
00:48:07,208 --> 00:48:08,375
I'll be back with
the lawyer soon.

625
00:48:08,750 --> 00:48:10,875
Come. We'll get the lawyer.

626
00:48:11,125 --> 00:48:12,917
- Shall we go?
- Come. We'll deal with this.

627
00:48:18,750 --> 00:48:20,167
Dad. I am ready.

628
00:48:20,458 --> 00:48:21,167
Ready for what?

629
00:48:21,708 --> 00:48:23,417
Please dad. Take
me along with you.

630
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,292
Maaran. Dad is going
on an official trip.

631
00:48:27,375 --> 00:48:30,125
I will be away and so you have
to be the man incharge here.

632
00:48:30,250 --> 00:48:34,292
Mom asked me to go along with you.
The school is off tomorrow.

633
00:48:36,792 --> 00:48:38,417
Did your mom say that?

634
00:48:41,208 --> 00:48:42,542
Wait. I'll talk to her.

635
00:48:43,208 --> 00:48:45,792
Mom, Dad has agreed.
Pack my clothes as well.

636
00:48:50,042 --> 00:48:51,500
He has fooled me with
an empty suitcase.

637
00:48:52,375 --> 00:48:53,500
You little rogue!

638
00:48:56,292 --> 00:48:59,042
Pack both our clothes
in a single suitcase.

639
00:48:59,750 --> 00:49:00,917
I can't be carrying
extra baggage.

640
00:49:03,958 --> 00:49:05,625
- Hey Maaran.
- Dad.

641
00:49:05,625 --> 00:49:07,750
- It's getting late.
- I am ready.

642
00:49:07,833 --> 00:49:08,333
Hi darling!

643
00:49:11,458 --> 00:49:14,125
Didn't I ask you to pack
everything in a single suitcase.

644
00:49:14,875 --> 00:49:20,792
Maaran, the charger, towel and soap
is in this bag. Remind dad about it.

645
00:49:22,667 --> 00:49:23,500
Shall I leave?

646
00:49:23,792 --> 00:49:26,833
Be careful. Don't
go away from dad.

647
00:49:27,417 --> 00:49:28,333
Be safe.

648
00:49:28,542 --> 00:49:31,375
- Bye dear.
- Take care.

649
00:49:32,958 --> 00:49:35,417
- Amma, dad is leaving.
- Bye dad. Be safe.

650
00:49:36,542 --> 00:49:38,875
Ok darling. Take care of mom.

651
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:41,167
- Bye
- Bye dad.

652
00:49:41,750 --> 00:49:42,500
Ok. I am leaving.

653
00:49:59,917 --> 00:50:01,042
- Uncle
- Sir

654
00:50:01,875 --> 00:50:04,167
- Sir. He is not anywhere here.
- Uncle.

655
00:50:06,875 --> 00:50:08,375
Where have you taken uncle?

656
00:50:10,417 --> 00:50:13,042
Hey! Who are you? Why are
you creating trouble here?

657
00:50:13,125 --> 00:50:13,875
Get out of the station now.

658
00:50:14,083 --> 00:50:16,792
- Where is my uncle?
- Uncle? I don't know any uncle.

659
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,333
- Where have you taken him after the remand?
- We never remanded him!

660
00:50:19,458 --> 00:50:20,958
- We didn't remand anyone.
- They are playing a game.

661
00:50:21,083 --> 00:50:22,167
Don't bluff.

662
00:50:22,250 --> 00:50:26,125
- Oh. So you guys want to play. I'll take care.
- Fine then. You take care.

663
00:50:26,250 --> 00:50:29,625
- I'll see what I can do.
- Oh that’s great!

664
00:50:30,125 --> 00:50:32,458
I'll take care of
you when am back.

665
00:50:34,958 --> 00:50:38,042
Sir. The vehicle has left.
Francis is with them.

666
00:50:38,708 --> 00:50:39,750
- Is it?
- Yes.

667
00:50:40,583 --> 00:50:44,125
Do not stop the vehicle.
Don't go inside the village.

668
00:50:45,333 --> 00:50:48,625
Get him whatever
he wants to eat.

669
00:50:49,292 --> 00:50:50,292
Where is the vehicle now?

670
00:51:00,708 --> 00:51:02,292
That's how I am.
What is bothering you?

671
00:51:02,708 --> 00:51:04,625
Oh is it? Give the
phone to daddy.

672
00:51:05,167 --> 00:51:05,917
- Give.
- Here dad.

673
00:51:06,833 --> 00:51:14,208
- Yes dear.
- It seems, Maaran will become an actor and not a cop like you.

674
00:51:14,542 --> 00:51:15,583
- Is it?
- Yes

675
00:51:16,458 --> 00:51:17,583
What will he do after
becoming an actor?

676
00:51:18,458 --> 00:51:20,333
He will act as if he is
fighting the baddies.

677
00:51:20,625 --> 00:51:24,208
- But what about dad?
- You thrash the baddies for real.

678
00:51:24,542 --> 00:51:27,875
That's my darling.
What is mom doing?

679
00:51:29,917 --> 00:51:33,125
- She is not here.
- Oh is it?

680
00:51:34,625 --> 00:51:37,042
What's there on your hand?

681
00:51:38,333 --> 00:51:41,375
- Not there. The other side.
- No. Don't turn it.

682
00:51:42,958 --> 00:51:45,167
Fatso! Be careful.
You might fall.

683
00:51:46,083 --> 00:51:47,417
Only I will be there to
take care even then.

684
00:51:49,667 --> 00:51:50,375
What?

685
00:51:53,542 --> 00:51:55,792
Hey! Will you talk to me or not?

686
00:51:58,167 --> 00:51:59,042
What is it?

687
00:51:59,917 --> 00:52:02,083
Maaran. Ask mom to talk to me.

688
00:52:02,333 --> 00:52:05,208
Mom please talk to daddy.
Please mom. Poor daddy!

689
00:52:05,292 --> 00:52:07,417
- Yea. Poor daddy!
- Take it mom.

690
00:52:09,708 --> 00:52:12,875
Hey Maaran. Did you eat?

691
00:52:13,167 --> 00:52:15,542
Be careful and be safe.

692
00:52:17,917 --> 00:52:18,750
You too.

693
00:52:21,208 --> 00:52:21,708
I'll hang up

694
00:52:22,417 --> 00:52:23,917
Ok. Bye.

695
00:52:29,625 --> 00:52:30,750
Here is your dinner.

696
00:52:32,417 --> 00:52:33,417
Forget it.

697
00:53:08,792 --> 00:53:09,292
Hey!

698
00:53:10,583 --> 00:53:12,042
Ammu is sleeping.
She might wake up.

699
00:53:12,417 --> 00:53:15,208
What is your problem? You want to visit
your mom, isn't it. I'll take you.

700
00:53:15,583 --> 00:53:18,042
- That wont be required.
- Its a little too much.

701
00:53:19,292 --> 00:53:20,333
I am not doing anything

702
00:53:20,792 --> 00:53:22,333
Hey Fatso! You
better listen to me.

703
00:53:23,250 --> 00:53:25,333
Look at me. Wait..

704
00:53:26,083 --> 00:53:28,750
You were dull when you called earlier
and you didn't have a bindhi.

705
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:30,375
How did it come now?

706
00:53:31,958 --> 00:53:33,250
It was there already.

707
00:53:33,625 --> 00:53:36,583
I am a cop. I know that
the bindhi was not there.

708
00:53:37,292 --> 00:53:39,917
- No. It was there.
- It wasn't.

709
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,042
Now, what if the bindhi is there or not?

710
00:53:42,708 --> 00:53:47,792
You have freshened up after I called
you and you give me dull emotions.

711
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:51,250
If you like me, say that you like me.
If you don't like me, say that you like me.

712
00:54:06,375 --> 00:54:08,458
Allure me not with
your sweet talks

713
00:54:08,792 --> 00:54:11,292
Your eyes do the magic

714
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:14,083
A little glance is all it needs

715
00:54:14,250 --> 00:54:16,708
For the sky to drizzle

716
00:54:16,958 --> 00:54:22,125
Whatever I do
I crave for your glance

717
00:54:22,375 --> 00:54:27,667
The farther we are
The stronger our love is

718
00:54:27,875 --> 00:54:33,875
Far, yet very close!

719
00:54:36,250 --> 00:54:41,250
Allure me not with your sweet talks
Your eyes do the magic

720
00:54:41,458 --> 00:54:46,750
A little glance is all it needs
For the sky to drizzle

721
00:54:46,792 --> 00:54:52,167
Whatever I do
I crave for your glance

722
00:54:52,292 --> 00:54:57,708
The farther we are
The stronger our love is

723
00:54:58,125 --> 00:55:03,625
Far, yet very close!

724
00:55:41,917 --> 00:55:46,750
Desire spins a web
And our hearts slip into it

725
00:55:47,083 --> 00:55:52,625
We try to recover
Only to slip in again

726
00:55:52,792 --> 00:55:57,875
Is solitude killing you?
Thoughts excruciating you

727
00:55:58,208 --> 00:56:03,833
Is your pillow scented
with my fragrance?

728
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:08,917
You abduct me with
your intense looks

729
00:56:09,083 --> 00:56:14,542
You place me amidst
the sun and the snow

730
00:56:14,625 --> 00:56:19,917
All I desire is your presence

731
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:25,708
And surprise with a silent kiss

732
00:56:29,292 --> 00:56:31,125
Hey! What?

733
00:56:31,750 --> 00:56:34,167
Either you get the child or
take the bag. Why are you still?

734
00:56:39,625 --> 00:56:40,667
Are you starting it again?

735
00:56:41,250 --> 00:56:42,958
Didn't we resolve
it over the call?

736
00:56:45,458 --> 00:56:47,625
Look into my eyes when
am talking to you.

737
00:56:49,083 --> 00:56:49,875
Look at me.

738
00:56:51,542 --> 00:56:56,958
Allure me not with your sweet talks
Your eyes do the magic

739
00:56:57,083 --> 00:57:01,958
A little glance is all it needs
For the sky to drizzle

740
00:57:02,417 --> 00:57:10,917
Allure me not with your sweet talks
Your eyes do the magic

741
00:57:11,417 --> 00:57:20,333
A little glance is all it needs
For the sky to drizzle

742
00:57:29,417 --> 00:57:31,250
- Did you take him to the court?
- Yes sir.

743
00:57:31,875 --> 00:57:33,833
- Who has accompanied from our side?
- Manickam.

744
00:57:35,958 --> 00:57:37,750
He will be bailed out for sure.

745
00:57:38,125 --> 00:57:41,250
That's for sure. But we had
him in custody for two days.

746
00:57:42,375 --> 00:57:43,792
He'll remember it for life.

747
00:57:47,792 --> 00:57:49,125
Why are you hitting me? Sir!

748
00:57:51,792 --> 00:57:56,792
Sir! Please don't hit us.
Its painful!

749
00:57:56,875 --> 00:57:58,917
Its painful!

750
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,542
- Murthy, What is it?
- Sir

751
00:58:02,458 --> 00:58:04,042
These are the culprits of
the chain snatching case.

752
00:58:04,750 --> 00:58:05,708
Break their bones.

753
00:58:06,917 --> 00:58:09,125
Ask them where the chain
is and inform that lady.

754
00:58:11,250 --> 00:58:14,375
The chain is not with these guys.
It's with them.

755
00:58:23,292 --> 00:58:25,792
Faster. Faster!

756
00:58:25,958 --> 00:58:27,458
Give it. How much
will you drink?

757
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:35,958
Let's go! Let's go!

758
00:58:37,042 --> 00:58:38,333
Sit down! Fast.

759
00:58:38,458 --> 00:58:40,250
Catch hold of them! Catch them!

760
00:58:40,542 --> 00:58:44,667
They snatched my chain.
Please get hold of them!

761
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,833
I've lost my chain.

762
00:58:50,333 --> 00:58:54,625
- Oh my!
- Last week too there was a chain snatching incident.

763
00:58:54,750 --> 00:58:58,167
This has become a routine.

764
00:58:58,250 --> 00:59:01,542
These guys have to be caught.
Wonder what the cops are up to.

765
00:59:02,458 --> 00:59:04,042
- Which grade?
- 12th grade

766
00:59:04,333 --> 00:59:07,458
Did you investigate properly? These
teens might be blabbering out of fear.

767
00:59:07,708 --> 00:59:08,875
It's confirmed.

768
00:59:09,208 --> 00:59:10,958
They have earlier been
booked under a petty case.

769
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:13,833
They have sold the chain
and bought a new mobile.

770
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,333
Tell me guys. Where have
you kept the chain?

771
00:59:23,792 --> 00:59:25,333
We don't know anything.

772
00:59:25,792 --> 00:59:27,583
We'll not do anything.

773
00:59:27,792 --> 00:59:29,125
I'll even book the case on them.

774
00:59:29,250 --> 00:59:31,500
I said, we don't know anything.

775
00:59:31,625 --> 00:59:33,333
- Shall I call your parents?
- As I said, we don't know anything.

776
00:59:34,250 --> 00:59:37,250
- How dare you?
- Don't you dare lay your hands on us.

777
00:59:37,833 --> 00:59:38,333
Murthy

778
00:59:39,458 --> 00:59:42,500
- What?
- Why is he raising his hands on students?

779
00:59:43,208 --> 00:59:45,292
They are right, Murthy.

780
00:59:45,542 --> 00:59:48,125
Why do you raise your
hands on students?

781
00:59:48,458 --> 00:59:51,125
Murthy! You don't seem
to know anything!

782
00:59:53,292 --> 00:59:55,958
We'll finish with
them the other way.

783
00:59:56,875 --> 00:59:59,000
- The other way man.
- Oh yes! Fine sir!

784
00:59:59,125 --> 01:00:01,000
- Ok
- Fine sir.

785
01:00:01,750 --> 01:00:03,042
We'll take care of you guys.

786
01:00:06,750 --> 01:00:07,583
Did you guys eat?

787
01:00:07,708 --> 01:00:08,625
We don't want anything.

788
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:10,833
Tell me if you are hungry. I'll
ask them to get something.

789
01:00:10,917 --> 01:00:11,875
No. Thanks!

790
01:00:12,167 --> 01:00:12,958
What about you?

791
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:16,417
Why are you guys so grim?

792
01:00:18,458 --> 01:00:19,125
Think and tell me.

793
01:00:28,875 --> 01:00:30,417
How long do you think
you can be silent?

794
01:00:31,750 --> 01:00:32,250
Sir

795
01:00:35,458 --> 01:00:38,792
So, both of you will not open up isn't it?

796
01:00:44,625 --> 01:00:45,125
Fine.

797
01:00:46,083 --> 01:00:46,875
I'll count to 5.

798
01:00:47,750 --> 01:00:50,708
One of you should tell the
truth before I finish.

799
01:00:51,833 --> 01:00:52,917
Otherwise...

800
01:00:55,542 --> 01:00:56,042
Murthy

801
01:00:59,500 --> 01:01:00,125
One

802
01:01:03,042 --> 01:01:03,875
Two

803
01:01:07,542 --> 01:01:08,875
Three

804
01:01:10,708 --> 01:01:11,625
What guys?

805
01:01:16,375 --> 01:01:17,458
Four

806
01:01:25,583 --> 01:01:26,333
Shall I say it?

807
01:01:30,167 --> 01:01:31,167
Five...

808
01:01:32,708 --> 01:01:34,417
Hey! Get hold of him!

809
01:02:11,333 --> 01:02:11,833
Sir!

810
01:02:18,125 --> 01:02:19,917
He is alive. Come here.

811
01:02:20,333 --> 01:02:21,708
Lift him.

812
01:02:24,875 --> 01:02:25,958
Lift him up.

813
01:02:26,792 --> 01:02:27,875
Go now.

814
01:02:28,958 --> 01:02:30,458
Hurry. Take him.

815
01:02:31,417 --> 01:02:31,917
Go on.

816
01:02:36,667 --> 01:02:39,917
The news is out. The public
might attack us. Let's leave.

817
01:02:40,583 --> 01:02:42,542
- Why should I leave?
- Sir please.

818
01:02:42,667 --> 01:02:45,333
Please sir. I plead you.
Please leave.

819
01:02:45,708 --> 01:02:47,083
Please. Let's leave.

820
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:53,750
Go ahead sir. This way.

821
01:03:04,958 --> 01:03:07,375
Stay here. Please
don't come out.

822
01:03:07,625 --> 01:03:10,083
Please don't come out.
I'll take care.

823
01:03:11,583 --> 01:03:13,708
- Where have you hid him?
- Let him out.

824
01:03:13,917 --> 01:03:16,875
- Call the inspector.
- Don't let anyone inside.

825
01:03:17,125 --> 01:03:19,000
Will you do anything
if you are cops?

826
01:03:19,292 --> 01:03:20,042
Such arrogance!

827
01:03:20,375 --> 01:03:22,125
Hey! Check the back door.

828
01:03:22,292 --> 01:03:24,917
- Get out.
- We'll not spare you guys.

829
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:26,542
We are going to
torch this station.

830
01:03:27,083 --> 01:03:29,958
Break open the doors
and get inside.

831
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,583
- Get out.
- Send him out.

832
01:03:34,958 --> 01:03:38,958
- Where is the inspector? Call him out.
- What are you all doin here. Leave.

833
01:03:39,333 --> 01:03:41,250
I said leave.

834
01:03:41,333 --> 01:03:45,292
I said leave. Look at them charging in.

835
01:03:45,375 --> 01:03:49,000
Move. I said leave.

836
01:03:51,167 --> 01:03:53,208
Sir please, I want to see my son.
Please let me in.

837
01:03:53,208 --> 01:03:55,125
Please I want to meet my son.

838
01:03:57,208 --> 01:04:00,833
I am worried about son and they
are not allwoing me inside.

839
01:04:01,125 --> 01:04:03,167
These sinners have shot him!

840
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:05,625
I curse these guys.

841
01:04:06,083 --> 01:04:08,250
This is injustice!

842
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:10,917
Sinners! How could
they do this to him?

843
01:04:12,917 --> 01:04:16,208
This incident has created tension
among the people of Madurai.

844
01:04:16,375 --> 01:04:18,625
The police, responsible for
protecting the people...

845
01:04:18,833 --> 01:04:22,583
had arrested the 17 year old Bala
for an inquiry and have shot him.

846
01:04:22,625 --> 01:04:23,917
Sinners!

847
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,458
- I need more intenstiy.
- Sinners!!

848
01:04:26,708 --> 01:04:28,542
How can they be so ruthless?

849
01:04:28,583 --> 01:04:31,250
Inspector Sethupathi, who is the
man behind this ruthless act...

850
01:04:31,375 --> 01:04:35,000
escaped from the Police
station, as per the reports.

851
01:04:35,292 --> 01:04:38,083
Here is an exclusive speech by
the MPK party on this incident.

852
01:04:38,333 --> 01:04:40,458
Without any consideration
for a young boy...

853
01:04:40,958 --> 01:04:45,583
...this inspector has ruthlessly
inquired him using weapons.

854
01:04:45,708 --> 01:04:48,667
Our MPK party condemns this act.

855
01:04:49,917 --> 01:04:51,333
Strongly condemns this.

856
01:04:51,458 --> 01:04:53,625
This cop should not be allowed
to continue his service.

857
01:04:53,625 --> 01:04:55,625
Not that, instead he
should be dismissed.

858
01:04:55,708 --> 01:04:57,458
Yes, he should be dismissed.

859
01:04:57,750 --> 01:04:58,625
Not it's suspension.

860
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:00,167
I heard a blast,

861
01:05:00,250 --> 01:05:02,792
then I saw people
running in and out.

862
01:05:02,875 --> 01:05:04,375
Later, an ambulance arrived...

863
01:05:04,458 --> 01:05:06,417
but I've no idea where
the ambulance left.

864
01:05:06,542 --> 01:05:09,208
But one thing, the police
never stepped out.

865
01:05:09,417 --> 01:05:10,583
He escaped away.

866
01:05:10,750 --> 01:05:13,750
The people are expecting a suspension
for police Inspector Sethupathi.

867
01:05:13,875 --> 01:05:19,292
They beileve that this decision will prevent
such incidents from happening in the future.

868
01:05:55,583 --> 01:05:56,917
The gun was locked.

869
01:05:57,625 --> 01:06:00,708
Which means it cannot
be triggered or fired.

870
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:03,750
Let's assume that it was
unlocked while handling it.

871
01:06:03,917 --> 01:06:07,375
In that case when triggered the bullet won't
go through the chamber unless it's clocked.

872
01:06:07,417 --> 01:06:08,375
I didn't clock it.

873
01:06:08,875 --> 01:06:10,083
Then how did it shoot?

874
01:06:33,625 --> 01:06:36,625
Haven't you heard? He shot
a young innocent boy.

875
01:06:37,875 --> 01:06:39,750
- Sir.
- There is no news if the guy is dead or alive.

876
01:06:39,833 --> 01:06:41,750
Yes sir. He was
the one who shot.

877
01:06:42,167 --> 01:06:43,625
He collapsed the
moment he got shot.

878
01:06:43,667 --> 01:06:46,625
- He was then carried away from there.
- He is the one.

879
01:06:55,417 --> 01:06:57,333
You know about his
way of inquiry.

880
01:06:57,750 --> 01:06:59,833
He points the gun at the person
first and then starts his inquiry.

881
01:06:59,917 --> 01:07:01,000
Did you see him shoot?

882
01:07:01,458 --> 01:07:03,792
- No sir. - Then stop talking
unnecessarily. Now get lost.

883
01:07:04,125 --> 01:07:05,625
Sir, I don't know
anything about it.

884
01:07:05,833 --> 01:07:08,042
How is it possible that none
of them in the station saw it?

885
01:07:08,042 --> 01:07:09,833
I was not in the
station that day.

886
01:07:10,125 --> 01:07:11,750
I was on beat duty.

887
01:07:12,042 --> 01:07:13,958
I heard the news later.

888
01:07:14,458 --> 01:07:15,792
Sir, we are innocent.

889
01:07:16,167 --> 01:07:18,625
We were forced to
accept the crime.

890
01:07:18,875 --> 01:07:20,417
We were threatned with guns.

891
01:07:20,625 --> 01:07:22,750
- Did he threaten to shoot you?
- Yes sir.

892
01:07:23,083 --> 01:07:26,208
I was not present at the spot. I was
outside cleaning the vehicle.

893
01:07:26,875 --> 01:07:28,625
I rushed in when I
heard the gun fire.

894
01:07:29,333 --> 01:07:32,958
The gun was with him
but he didn't... fire

895
01:07:33,708 --> 01:07:35,500
The boy got up and ran.
We chased him.

896
01:07:35,917 --> 01:07:37,083
Then there was a gun fire.

897
01:07:37,667 --> 01:07:38,750
and when we arrived there...

898
01:07:38,792 --> 01:07:40,292
He was the one who triggered it.
Right?

899
01:07:40,292 --> 01:07:42,083
Do you think the gun
will trigger itself?

900
01:07:53,417 --> 01:07:53,833
Sir...

901
01:07:56,750 --> 01:07:57,833
Please don't worry.

902
01:07:58,833 --> 01:08:00,292
It's our men they are inquiring.

903
01:08:01,375 --> 01:08:03,792
We'll take care. It's all upto us.

904
01:08:09,458 --> 01:08:10,583
- Murthy
- Sir?

905
01:08:11,708 --> 01:08:13,000
The gun wasn't clocked...

906
01:08:14,375 --> 01:08:16,500
Then how would the bullet
go through the chamber?

907
01:08:17,833 --> 01:08:18,667
Correct sir!

908
01:08:19,583 --> 01:08:22,375
The other day, it was me who kept it.
At that time it was locked.

909
01:08:22,833 --> 01:08:24,875
Even now I was the one who
got it from the locker.

910
01:08:26,333 --> 01:08:27,667
The how could it... ?

911
01:08:31,375 --> 01:08:32,542
I didn't unlock it...

912
01:08:33,833 --> 01:08:35,083
Sir, just a moment.

913
01:08:37,750 --> 01:08:40,542
- Sir.
- Stop it. Stop treating him like an accused.

914
01:08:41,958 --> 01:08:44,042
- Sir, give me your phone.
- Sir, what happened?

915
01:08:44,583 --> 01:08:46,417
Sir, the boy died
at the hospital.

916
01:08:47,083 --> 01:08:48,250
AC has summoned you.

917
01:08:48,750 --> 01:08:49,667
Give me you phone.

918
01:08:57,083 --> 01:08:58,333
Sir, you wait.

919
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:18,458
Sir. Sir, hold on for a minute.

920
01:09:26,708 --> 01:09:28,333
Sir, give me the phone first.

921
01:09:28,875 --> 01:09:29,708
What's the hurry?

922
01:09:29,958 --> 01:09:30,958
I said give the phone.

923
01:09:36,333 --> 01:09:38,083
Sir, it seems the
news is a fake one.

924
01:09:38,208 --> 01:09:39,750
It's a rumour sparked
by the media.

925
01:09:39,833 --> 01:09:41,667
Nothing has happened to the boy.
He is fine.

926
01:09:41,750 --> 01:09:44,750
These people, without knowing what has
happened... Sir, please get down.

927
01:09:48,042 --> 01:09:49,417
Wait, let me hire
an autorikshaw..

928
01:09:50,208 --> 01:09:51,250
- I'll take care.
- I'll hire a rickshaw...

929
01:09:51,292 --> 01:09:52,500
I said, I'll take care.

930
01:09:55,292 --> 01:09:55,792
Sir...

931
01:10:43,125 --> 01:10:44,500
Oh! Looks like I forgot to lock.

932
01:10:44,958 --> 01:10:45,875
Mom is here.

933
01:10:55,667 --> 01:10:56,708
Now open your mouth.

934
01:10:57,792 --> 01:10:58,917
Come in son-in-law.

935
01:10:59,708 --> 01:11:01,125
Wash your hands.
I'll serve food.

936
01:11:18,500 --> 01:11:19,333
The food is ser...

937
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:24,000
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

938
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,292
- Don't worry we'll take care of it.
- Sir! - Sir!

939
01:11:44,583 --> 01:11:45,292
What is this?

940
01:11:46,875 --> 01:11:47,917
Who broke the latch?

941
01:11:49,750 --> 01:11:50,708
I don't know

942
01:11:53,208 --> 01:11:54,375
The keys are with you right?

943
01:11:56,083 --> 01:11:59,250
Unless the door is locked the
latch cannot be broken. Right?

944
01:12:02,125 --> 01:12:03,125
I don't know.

945
01:12:04,042 --> 01:12:05,125
So you don't know?

946
01:12:06,458 --> 01:12:09,875
- Move out. Move!
- Make it fast.

947
01:12:12,792 --> 01:12:15,458
All those who were present the other
day, stay back. Others leave.

948
01:12:15,458 --> 01:12:18,125
Were you there? Then get out!

949
01:12:35,042 --> 01:12:36,000
- Murthy...
- Sir?

950
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:38,875
Go get the gun.

951
01:12:56,875 --> 01:12:57,833
Now come on.

952
01:13:00,083 --> 01:13:00,958
Catch him.

953
01:13:17,500 --> 01:13:18,458
Francis...

954
01:13:20,667 --> 01:13:21,167
Sir?

955
01:13:25,292 --> 01:13:27,875
Why did you come
inside, the other day?

956
01:13:28,125 --> 01:13:28,875
When sir?

957
01:13:29,875 --> 01:13:31,625
The day, when two
boys were arrested...

958
01:13:31,833 --> 01:13:33,292
and I shot one of them.

959
01:13:33,458 --> 01:13:35,708
On that day, you came in rushing.
Why did you come in?

960
01:13:36,042 --> 01:13:37,458
I came hearing the gun fire.

961
01:13:38,083 --> 01:13:38,792
Francis...

962
01:13:39,875 --> 01:13:41,958
Think about lie to which
I could fall for.

963
01:13:45,125 --> 01:13:46,250
I forgot sir...

964
01:13:46,500 --> 01:13:49,708
The vehicle had a flat tyre. I
actually came in to inform that.

965
01:13:52,542 --> 01:13:54,458
Sir, indeed the vehicle
got a flat tyre.

966
01:13:55,417 --> 01:13:57,917
I am aware why and
for whom you did...

967
01:14:02,958 --> 01:14:03,792
Sir...

968
01:14:07,375 --> 01:14:08,917
I did it for Vaathiyar.

969
01:14:09,583 --> 01:14:11,167
I was shopping to buy a television.

970
01:14:11,292 --> 01:14:13,708
My wife wanted an even bigger TV
than the one we intented to buy.

971
01:14:14,167 --> 01:14:17,417
As I couldn't afford that, we
returned home empty handed.

972
01:14:18,750 --> 01:14:21,458
One day, when I returned home there
was the televsion my wife wanted.

973
01:14:23,917 --> 01:14:25,750
- What is this?
- This is childlock button madam.

974
01:14:25,833 --> 01:14:26,500
Look here!

975
01:14:26,625 --> 01:14:27,542
How did this
television come here?

976
01:14:27,667 --> 01:14:30,125
- Be patient.
- If you don't want any channel you can lock them.

977
01:14:30,375 --> 01:14:32,250
Some guys of
Vaathiyar gave this.

978
01:14:33,375 --> 01:14:34,958
This is the zoom in
and zoom out option.

979
01:14:35,125 --> 01:14:37,833
And here, you can search
and set the channels it.

980
01:14:38,500 --> 01:14:42,500
- I'll set everything and leave. Here is my card.
- TEXT: Vaathiyar's gift. Wait for further information.

981
01:14:43,042 --> 01:14:48,292
As stated in the letter, Vaathiyar's guy met
me with a parcel. He had his helmet on.

982
01:14:49,917 --> 01:14:52,417
The parcel had Rs.1 lakh...

983
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:54,333
...and the dummy magazine.

984
01:14:55,208 --> 01:14:59,458
The letter informed me to
replace the dummy in your gun.

985
01:15:00,833 --> 01:15:04,083
I accepted to do it
for want of money!

986
01:15:05,583 --> 01:15:06,083
Pandi...

987
01:15:06,375 --> 01:15:06,833
Sir?

988
01:15:06,875 --> 01:15:08,583
Go check who is
shouting there outside.

989
01:15:08,708 --> 01:15:09,208
Ok sir.

990
01:15:31,583 --> 01:15:34,125
- There is no one out there.
- Is it?

991
01:15:34,167 --> 01:15:34,875
Fine. Leave it.

992
01:15:41,625 --> 01:15:42,917
C4 station reporting sir. Over.

993
01:15:43,458 --> 01:15:43,917
Sir

994
01:15:44,625 --> 01:15:45,542
- Ok sir
- Thanks sir

995
01:15:47,792 --> 01:15:48,292
Ok sir.

996
01:15:49,625 --> 01:15:50,583
On the way sir. Over.

997
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,292
I went in and checked
out the gun.

998
01:16:08,708 --> 01:16:10,583
I didn't know how
to set the dummy.

999
01:16:11,583 --> 01:16:13,000
So I tried out whatever I could.

1000
01:16:13,625 --> 01:16:15,333
By then I heard
someone coming in

1001
01:16:16,083 --> 01:16:19,000
So I left it, as it is.

1002
01:16:19,500 --> 01:16:20,500
This is what happened.

1003
01:16:21,833 --> 01:16:22,917
Sorry sir. Forgive me.

1004
01:16:23,875 --> 01:16:25,042
Did you clock it?

1005
01:16:26,125 --> 01:16:28,875
Did you pull the top
and clock the gun?

1006
01:16:29,583 --> 01:16:32,125
I did it that way. Nothing else.
Sorry sir.

1007
01:16:33,750 --> 01:16:34,792
I don't know anything sir.

1008
01:16:35,167 --> 01:16:37,500
I was asked to puncture the vehicle,
so that you would use your bike.

1009
01:16:37,667 --> 01:16:39,167
I promise I don't
know anything else.

1010
01:16:39,250 --> 01:16:41,542
So you punctured the bike
because you were asked to?

1011
01:16:41,625 --> 01:16:42,333
Yes sir.

1012
01:16:42,667 --> 01:16:45,625
- And you don't know anything else?
- I don't know anything else.

1013
01:16:46,667 --> 01:16:48,208
An insult to the trust
I had upon you...

1014
01:16:50,083 --> 01:16:52,250
Absolutely no knowledge
on operating a gun...

1015
01:16:52,500 --> 01:16:53,792
and you call yourself a cop.

1016
01:16:55,417 --> 01:16:57,125
People out there are struggling
to become a cop.

1017
01:16:57,125 --> 01:17:00,667
and you show up at the station to
while away time, eat and take bribes.

1018
01:17:03,958 --> 01:17:04,833
- Murthy
- Sir?

1019
01:17:05,500 --> 01:17:07,167
Ask them to leave or
I'll butcher them.

1020
01:17:07,542 --> 01:17:11,083
Get up. Get up. Get lost.

1021
01:17:17,750 --> 01:17:18,208
Sir...

1022
01:17:21,667 --> 01:17:24,958
Sir, now that it is clear that Vaathiyar
is behind all this. What next?

1023
01:17:27,708 --> 01:17:28,917
Why should Vaathiyar do this?

1024
01:17:29,417 --> 01:17:31,542
Sir, isn't it quite obvious?

1025
01:17:31,667 --> 01:17:34,875
You insulted him and put him behind bars.
He wants to revenge.

1026
01:17:36,458 --> 01:17:36,958
No chance.

1027
01:17:37,333 --> 01:17:37,792
Now...

1028
01:17:39,750 --> 01:17:40,917
In the current situation...

1029
01:17:41,417 --> 01:17:43,667
Let alone Vaathiyar, even if
anyone lay their hands on me...

1030
01:17:43,917 --> 01:17:46,417
The blame will still be on him.
He knows that very well.

1031
01:17:48,167 --> 01:17:51,708
How would Vaathiyar know that Muruganandam's
wife wanted a biger television?

1032
01:17:52,875 --> 01:17:53,583
That's right sir.

1033
01:17:57,167 --> 01:17:58,500
Rewind it.

1034
01:17:59,667 --> 01:18:00,167
Little more.

1035
01:18:01,583 --> 01:18:02,333
Keep going.

1036
01:18:04,500 --> 01:18:05,417
Hold it right there.

1037
01:18:07,125 --> 01:18:09,000
- That's Muruganandam right?
- Yes sir.

1038
01:18:10,167 --> 01:18:12,250
- Ask him to continue...
- Forward it a little bit.

1039
01:18:18,708 --> 01:18:19,958
- Hold it.
- Hod it.

1040
01:18:21,500 --> 01:18:22,375
Zoom in.

1041
01:18:29,083 --> 01:18:31,417
- Doesn't it look like Kanagavel?
- Yes sir.

1042
01:18:46,792 --> 01:18:49,667
I cannot go against
my father-in-law.

1043
01:18:50,083 --> 01:18:53,708
Sethupathi sir insulted him
and put him behind bars.

1044
01:18:54,375 --> 01:18:57,083
His men would've definitely
tried to finish off Sethupathi.

1045
01:18:57,333 --> 01:18:59,500
So I took advantage of
the situation and...

1046
01:19:01,625 --> 01:19:04,125
I tried to replace dummy
bullets in the gun.

1047
01:19:04,958 --> 01:19:08,583
If something happens to Sethupathi because
of this, the department won't spare them.

1048
01:19:09,208 --> 01:19:10,667
The case against him will
be even more stronger.

1049
01:19:10,917 --> 01:19:15,000
He'll either be encountered or put
behind bars under a non-bailable case.

1050
01:19:15,167 --> 01:19:17,375
So you didn't care
about Sethupathi.

1051
01:19:17,458 --> 01:19:20,208
All you wanted was to finish off your
father-in-law in a police encounter.

1052
01:19:20,208 --> 01:19:22,667
And you call yourself a cop.

1053
01:19:23,625 --> 01:19:26,500
- Sir, It was a mistake.
- Thank you sir.

1054
01:19:27,833 --> 01:19:29,250
- Sir, It was a mistake. Sir...

1055
01:19:32,208 --> 01:19:34,458
Yes sir. I've spoken to Kanagavel.

1056
01:19:34,708 --> 01:19:36,625
Tomorrow morning 11 a.m
Murthy will go get him.

1057
01:19:36,667 --> 01:19:38,125
- Leave it.
- No, let me do it.

1058
01:19:38,167 --> 01:19:40,958
-  I want to carry it. Leave it.
-  Leave it.

1059
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:42,292
I'll carry it. Leave.

1060
01:19:42,417 --> 01:19:46,792
- I'll carry it. Now leave!
- Leave.

1061
01:19:49,500 --> 01:19:50,958
- Sorry dad.
- Sorry dad.

1062
01:19:56,792 --> 01:19:57,917
Awesome!!

1063
01:20:30,208 --> 01:20:31,000
Go check.

1064
01:20:43,333 --> 01:20:45,542
- Didn't you hear the bell sound?
- Yes.

1065
01:20:45,583 --> 01:20:47,833
- But no one's at the door.
- Forget it. Now come on.

1066
01:20:52,417 --> 01:20:53,958
Wait I'll go check.
You continue dear.

1067
01:20:57,083 --> 01:20:57,583
Be careful.

1068
01:22:01,417 --> 01:22:02,375
Hey Kanagavel!

1069
01:22:02,917 --> 01:22:04,250
Sir! Save me!

1070
01:23:01,542 --> 01:23:04,708
If you get back your work based on his
statement, then what are we here for?

1071
01:23:05,875 --> 01:23:08,000
What is he capable of?

1072
01:23:09,083 --> 01:23:09,583
Now look...

1073
01:23:10,417 --> 01:23:12,125
He is burnt to ashes with
no one to question!

1074
01:23:12,625 --> 01:23:15,042
How are you going to
get back your work?

1075
01:23:16,167 --> 01:23:18,625
- Catch hold of him.
- Hold him.

1076
01:23:22,125 --> 01:23:24,750
Without the uniform you
are not even a man!

1077
01:23:25,292 --> 01:23:27,875
Just think how mad I would be?

1078
01:23:31,167 --> 01:23:33,708
I could have finished him
off at some remote place.

1079
01:23:33,833 --> 01:23:35,792
Why do you think I did
this in front of you?

1080
01:23:35,833 --> 01:23:38,750
Everything has a reasoning
to it, Sethupathi.

1081
01:23:39,083 --> 01:23:40,542
Don't you know very well?

1082
01:23:41,792 --> 01:23:45,667
I will henceforth decide
every incident of your life.

1083
01:23:47,375 --> 01:23:47,875
Fine...

1084
01:23:48,958 --> 01:23:49,958
Now rush to your home.

1085
01:23:50,250 --> 01:23:51,167
Let him go.

1086
01:23:52,625 --> 01:23:54,083
I say this for your own good.

1087
01:23:54,167 --> 01:23:56,792
Didn't you leave the door open?
Now run.

1088
01:23:57,083 --> 01:23:58,667
You tried to take me
for a ride, is it?

1089
01:24:25,917 --> 01:24:26,667
What happened?

1090
01:24:27,833 --> 01:24:28,583
Tell me...

1091
01:24:33,500 --> 01:24:36,417
What's up Sethu? Reached home?

1092
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:38,625
I hope your family is fine?

1093
01:24:39,125 --> 01:24:41,375
They are fine. Didn't I tell you?

1094
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,667
I'll be deciding your life hereafter.

1095
01:24:45,208 --> 01:24:48,750
I haven't started yet. So until then
have a good time with your family.

1096
01:24:49,167 --> 01:24:50,167
Sounds fine?

1097
01:24:51,917 --> 01:24:53,250
Who am I?

1098
01:24:54,417 --> 01:24:55,625
Who am I?

1099
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:58,333
Now come on tell me...

1100
01:24:59,042 --> 01:25:00,250
Who am I?

1101
01:25:01,625 --> 01:25:02,958
Who am I?

1102
01:25:03,875 --> 01:25:05,208
Who am I?

1103
01:25:06,125 --> 01:25:07,708
Now let me tell you...

1104
01:25:08,542 --> 01:25:09,625
so listen.

1105
01:25:10,917 --> 01:25:12,667
I am the king.

1106
01:25:13,250 --> 01:25:15,417
I am the king.

1107
01:25:15,583 --> 01:25:20,333
In every land, I am the king.

1108
01:25:20,583 --> 01:25:24,583
I am the king. I am THE king.

1109
01:25:24,708 --> 01:25:29,042
Forever I am the king.

1110
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,667
Touch me and you'll be ashes...

1111
01:25:32,792 --> 01:25:35,000
Provoke me and I'll
turn into a volcano!

1112
01:25:35,083 --> 01:25:37,583
I'll beat you down in no time.

1113
01:25:37,708 --> 01:25:40,000
Come try challenging me.

1114
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:44,333
I break the rules because I
don't care who make the rules.

1115
01:25:44,625 --> 01:25:48,500
Question me and I'll beat you down!
So make a move.

1116
01:25:48,542 --> 01:25:50,917
Hey mama! You wanna hate me?

1117
01:25:50,958 --> 01:25:53,167
Hey mama! You wanna hate me?

1118
01:25:53,250 --> 01:25:55,167
Hey mama! You wanna hate me?

1119
01:25:55,208 --> 01:25:57,667
Hey mama! You wanna hate me?

1120
01:26:16,500 --> 01:26:20,917
I have conquered all
and I have no limits.

1121
01:26:21,208 --> 01:26:25,750
If you are a hunter remember you
have to hunt to make your living.

1122
01:26:25,833 --> 01:26:30,542
I don't care who made the laws.

1123
01:26:30,750 --> 01:26:35,083
I'll destroy everything that comes
in my way. That's all I got to say.

1124
01:26:35,250 --> 01:26:40,000
No matter what, I draw
the first blood....

1125
01:26:40,083 --> 01:26:44,708
That is all, there would be nothing
left in the enemy to revolt.

1126
01:26:53,917 --> 01:26:55,833
I am the king.

1127
01:26:55,958 --> 01:27:00,708
I am the king. I am THE king.

1128
01:27:00,750 --> 01:27:07,292
I, me, myself am the King.

1129
01:27:37,208 --> 01:27:40,000
- Listen. That cop's wife is here.
- When did she come?

1130
01:27:40,208 --> 01:27:41,792
Just now. You tell me.

1131
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:45,833
You'll be soon fine. Ok?

1132
01:27:46,625 --> 01:27:49,958
Your husband shot him and now
are you here to finish him off?

1133
01:27:50,083 --> 01:27:53,458
- Get lost. I said get lost.
- Please don't yell.

1134
01:27:53,833 --> 01:27:56,875
Who wants your compliments?
Take it along with you.

1135
01:27:57,125 --> 01:28:00,125
I curse you people! Now get lost!

1136
01:28:00,375 --> 01:28:03,250
Your family will suffer.
Your kids will suffer too...

1137
01:28:03,458 --> 01:28:06,542
Look what you have done to me.
You people will suffer bad.

1138
01:28:06,708 --> 01:28:11,375
Now get lost!

1139
01:28:18,708 --> 01:28:20,167
Look what your husband has done.

1140
01:28:33,375 --> 01:28:34,083
Hey...

1141
01:28:36,792 --> 01:28:38,000
Where have you been?

1142
01:28:38,250 --> 01:28:38,875
To the temple.

1143
01:28:40,500 --> 01:28:41,958
Is the temple situated inside
the government hospital?

1144
01:28:43,875 --> 01:28:44,958
Did I request you?

1145
01:28:46,042 --> 01:28:48,167
To find an alternative
to get my job back?

1146
01:28:50,458 --> 01:28:52,917
I got a call asking if I've started
sending you to beg on my behalf!

1147
01:28:55,167 --> 01:28:56,167
Do I look like that?

1148
01:28:58,208 --> 01:28:59,083
Why did you do this?

1149
01:29:01,167 --> 01:29:03,333
- Why did you do this?
- Mom can hear us. Let's talk later.

1150
01:29:03,375 --> 01:29:04,458
Can't you hear me?

1151
01:29:07,375 --> 01:29:08,917
Now what is this?

1152
01:29:09,292 --> 01:29:11,083
Wipe off the paint.
Look at your face.

1153
01:29:11,667 --> 01:29:13,875
Look at mom, playing
with the paint.

1154
01:29:14,833 --> 01:29:17,708
Daddy has a small work to take care of.
I'll be back. Now go to mom.

1155
01:29:17,917 --> 01:29:18,542
Bye...

1156
01:29:21,667 --> 01:29:24,292
My darling. Come here dear.

1157
01:29:25,792 --> 01:29:26,875
My darling...

1158
01:29:28,208 --> 01:29:31,292
Both of us playing
and I stumbled...

1159
01:29:31,375 --> 01:29:33,000
- Promise?
- Promise.

1160
01:29:37,083 --> 01:29:38,792
- My darling.
- Look here.

1161
01:29:39,333 --> 01:29:41,375
Pack your things.

1162
01:29:41,417 --> 01:29:43,542
You can return after his
problems are solved.

1163
01:29:44,125 --> 01:29:46,917
If this is happening when I am
around, what about when I'm not?

1164
01:29:47,917 --> 01:29:48,583
Look here...

1165
01:29:49,208 --> 01:29:51,542
If he has thrashed me now, later
he'll return to pamper me.

1166
01:29:52,583 --> 01:29:53,708
I should be here for that.

1167
01:29:54,458 --> 01:29:56,000
If you want to leave,
you better leave.

1168
01:29:59,208 --> 01:29:59,958
You come dear.

1169
01:30:04,417 --> 01:30:06,750
Yes sir. Everything's ready.
I'll come there in 5 mins.

1170
01:30:07,042 --> 01:30:09,458
Ok sir. Bye sir.

1171
01:30:23,125 --> 01:30:23,625
Sir.

1172
01:30:28,792 --> 01:30:30,500
Look if it is this nail
that punctured it.

1173
01:30:43,750 --> 01:30:44,792
Sir please.

1174
01:30:44,958 --> 01:30:46,917
Sir please. I don't have money.

1175
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:48,917
Sir I don't have any money with me.
Please sir.

1176
01:30:50,292 --> 01:30:51,917
- Now who asked?
- Sir please.

1177
01:30:52,083 --> 01:30:53,875
- Now who asked you money?
- Sir please.

1178
01:30:54,417 --> 01:30:56,708
- I don't have any money.
- Who asked you money?

1179
01:30:57,125 --> 01:30:59,750
- Awesome Karthi. Awesome.
- Who asked you?

1180
01:30:59,875 --> 01:31:02,292
Hey Inspector!! Amazing!!!

1181
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:16,500
Karthi, now come on. Come back.

1182
01:31:23,542 --> 01:31:25,583
Seems like he bashed you up.

1183
01:31:25,667 --> 01:31:28,250
He knew he fell into the trap.
What else could have he done?

1184
01:31:28,542 --> 01:31:31,875
- Send this to the lady in the commission. She'll take care of the rest.
- Ok.

1185
01:31:37,625 --> 01:31:38,583
Look at this.

1186
01:31:39,042 --> 01:31:41,125
This is his atrocity when
he is not in charge.

1187
01:31:41,583 --> 01:31:44,458
Who would believe that
he did not shoot?

1188
01:31:45,125 --> 01:31:46,250
Now what is all this about?

1189
01:31:46,500 --> 01:31:49,292
Do you think we are jobless?

1190
01:31:49,500 --> 01:31:51,458
Who is answerable
to our superiors?

1191
01:31:51,750 --> 01:31:54,250
All these days I was being
considerate because you said so.

1192
01:31:54,458 --> 01:31:56,250
Let's finish of this
case once and forever.

1193
01:31:56,792 --> 01:31:59,375
Sir, I haven't submitted
any evidence yet.

1194
01:31:59,792 --> 01:32:03,625
What are you going to do? You will put
the blame on the victim and get away?

1195
01:32:04,333 --> 01:32:06,750
We are running out of time.
You may leave.

1196
01:32:08,167 --> 01:32:09,042
Are you running out of time?

1197
01:32:10,167 --> 01:32:12,875
He set ablaze the cop who was
supposed to be my witness...

1198
01:32:13,583 --> 01:32:15,458
...and swears at me saying that
I'm nothing without the uniform.

1199
01:32:16,208 --> 01:32:17,542
I couldn't do anything about it.

1200
01:32:18,875 --> 01:32:22,167
I would try finding out another witness
but you say you are out of time.

1201
01:32:23,667 --> 01:32:24,708
Anyway thanks madam.

1202
01:32:24,958 --> 01:32:27,167
You would set up some of
your men from the station.

1203
01:32:27,333 --> 01:32:29,500
- We can't accept them as witness.
- Wait madam.

1204
01:32:29,625 --> 01:32:30,958
First, let him bring the witness.

1205
01:32:31,042 --> 01:32:33,417
We will then decide
if it is true or not.

1206
01:32:33,875 --> 01:32:35,875
Bring your witness day
after tomorrow morning.

1207
01:32:36,792 --> 01:32:37,875
Ok sir. Thank you.

1208
01:32:43,167 --> 01:32:45,250
- Yes tell me.
- Listen to me carefully.

1209
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:51,000
Sethupathi has claimed to bring a
police constable as his witness.

1210
01:32:51,125 --> 01:32:52,417
- Be careful.
- I'm on my way.

1211
01:32:52,750 --> 01:32:54,958
No problem. I'll manage.

1212
01:32:55,500 --> 01:32:57,792
He can do nothing! Start the vehicle.

1213
01:32:59,083 --> 01:32:59,917
No nothing like...

1214
01:33:01,208 --> 01:33:02,000
Idiot...

1215
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:05,292
It's Sethu...

1216
01:33:08,583 --> 01:33:11,750
He is getting away. Follow. Follow him.
Get a video. Now!

1217
01:33:11,958 --> 01:33:12,542
Start. Quick!

1218
01:33:12,667 --> 01:33:14,917
- Give me that phone.
- Move! Move!

1219
01:33:15,083 --> 01:33:16,542
Go! Go! Come on shoot!

1220
01:33:17,042 --> 01:33:18,000
He is trapped.

1221
01:33:18,625 --> 01:33:20,000
I'll send this video
right away to that lady.

1222
01:33:34,750 --> 01:33:36,208
Now shoot your video.

1223
01:33:36,917 --> 01:33:40,292
Start the vehicle. Come on.
Start the vehicle.

1224
01:33:40,625 --> 01:33:42,083
Get in. Get in. Quick!

1225
01:33:43,375 --> 01:33:45,083
Start. I said start!

1226
01:33:59,083 --> 01:34:00,000
Sir..no please.

1227
01:34:04,667 --> 01:34:05,167
Sir...

1228
01:34:05,333 --> 01:34:06,167
No don't.

1229
01:34:14,667 --> 01:34:15,500
No don't.

1230
01:34:18,125 --> 01:34:19,792
You'll be in trouble
if uncle gets to know.

1231
01:34:41,458 --> 01:34:42,292
No Sethu...

1232
01:34:45,917 --> 01:34:46,958
Sethu, no.

1233
01:34:54,875 --> 01:34:55,750
Sethu, please don't.

1234
01:34:58,083 --> 01:34:59,125
Sethu, don't.

1235
01:35:05,125 --> 01:35:05,833
Sethu, no.

1236
01:35:14,792 --> 01:35:16,083
It hurts..

1237
01:35:17,542 --> 01:35:19,458
Please, it hurts.

1238
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:24,000
What did I tell you?

1239
01:35:24,125 --> 01:35:25,208
What have you done?

1240
01:35:25,375 --> 01:35:26,958
Didn't I tell you in the morning?

1241
01:35:27,125 --> 01:35:28,083
Sir, Sethu is on his way here.

1242
01:35:28,292 --> 01:35:29,375
Gather our guys.

1243
01:35:52,708 --> 01:35:54,667
Butcher him if he nears.

1244
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:23,375
Hey Darling!

1245
01:37:23,917 --> 01:37:25,000
I'm starving.

1246
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:27,292
I'll get the food. You leave.

1247
01:37:28,542 --> 01:37:29,500
What the...

1248
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:30,958
Now what?

1249
01:37:31,667 --> 01:37:33,458
Why did you put off the stove?

1250
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:38,333
Look into my eyes and speak.

1251
01:37:39,167 --> 01:37:40,583
I won't. Tell me.

1252
01:37:43,583 --> 01:37:44,000
Fine...

1253
01:37:44,833 --> 01:37:45,625
Sorry.

1254
01:37:46,917 --> 01:37:48,375
Didn't you realize this earlier?

1255
01:37:51,708 --> 01:37:52,250
Fine...

1256
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:53,792
Sorry

1257
01:37:59,125 --> 01:38:01,250
I apologized. Do you want
me to fall at your feet?

1258
01:38:02,417 --> 01:38:03,792
Why are you behaving like this?

1259
01:38:05,583 --> 01:38:06,083
Yes....

1260
01:38:08,875 --> 01:38:09,833
Fall at my feet.

1261
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:15,750
- Come now. What?
- Leave.

1262
01:38:23,917 --> 01:38:24,875
Oh! Oh!

1263
01:38:26,208 --> 01:38:27,458
Did that hurt? Sorry.

1264
01:38:28,792 --> 01:38:32,792
- Sorry. Are we good?
- Cut the drama...

1265
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:36,958
Now fall at my feet.

1266
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,958
Fine darling! Forgive
this husband.

1267
01:38:50,958 --> 01:38:53,417
Hey! I just fell at your feet.

1268
01:38:56,083 --> 01:38:57,417
I apologized too.

1269
01:38:57,958 --> 01:38:59,708
Have some sympathy
for your husband.

1270
01:39:00,083 --> 01:39:00,583
Please.

1271
01:39:05,833 --> 01:39:06,875
Fatso...

1272
01:39:07,500 --> 01:39:08,083
Rogue.

1273
01:39:08,292 --> 01:39:10,417
- Now what?
- What?

1274
01:39:11,125 --> 01:39:12,458
You are under arrest.

1275
01:39:15,583 --> 01:39:16,958
He shot a young boy.

1276
01:39:17,250 --> 01:39:18,625
That boy is just 17 yrs old.

1277
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:21,333
If he were dead, we won't be
sitting down for this case.

1278
01:39:21,833 --> 01:39:24,708
You are taking advantage of the
fact that he is still alive.

1279
01:39:24,958 --> 01:39:25,875
This is unfair.

1280
01:39:26,167 --> 01:39:29,583
That doesn't mean we cannot
listen to his statement.

1281
01:39:29,792 --> 01:39:31,500
That is why this commission
has been set up.

1282
01:39:31,500 --> 01:39:33,667
Everything about this is
evident to the whole world...

1283
01:39:33,792 --> 01:39:36,000
and now whom have you got
from your department?

1284
01:39:36,333 --> 01:39:39,667
I'm 100% sure this is
cooked up witness.

1285
01:39:39,750 --> 01:39:42,167
How can you say it is cooked up?

1286
01:39:42,417 --> 01:39:44,250
We can't bluntly accept
your assumptions.

1287
01:39:44,292 --> 01:39:46,167
We can find the truth
only after investigation.

1288
01:39:46,167 --> 01:39:47,458
I will investigate this case.

1289
01:39:47,792 --> 01:39:49,750
If your are willing stay
in this commission.

1290
01:39:49,833 --> 01:39:50,542
If not,

1291
01:39:50,667 --> 01:39:54,708
Give a written statement that your aren't
willing to participate and leave.

1292
01:39:55,667 --> 01:39:56,625
Please come in.

1293
01:39:57,917 --> 01:40:00,750
- Ask that police constable to come in.
- Ok sir.

1294
01:40:07,583 --> 01:40:12,333
Is it true that you tried replacing
dummy bullets in his gun?

1295
01:40:13,625 --> 01:40:14,708
He is lying.

1296
01:40:15,458 --> 01:40:16,875
I've got nothing to do with it.

1297
01:40:17,583 --> 01:40:18,958
He is threatening me.

1298
01:40:19,583 --> 01:40:22,458
I told you! Now you
guys handle this case.

1299
01:40:22,833 --> 01:40:26,125
I'll submit my reports. You guys
keep entertaining further witnesses.

1300
01:40:45,208 --> 01:40:45,708
Sir...

1301
01:40:46,750 --> 01:40:47,500
Please come in.

1302
01:40:48,667 --> 01:40:51,167
- So, how are you?
- I am fine.

1303
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:55,042
Please have a seat.

1304
01:40:58,000 --> 01:40:59,292
Now tell us what happened?

1305
01:40:59,708 --> 01:41:02,458
Do you think I am fool. Why did
you lie during the investigation?

1306
01:41:02,875 --> 01:41:04,958
- What are you talking about?
- Now, tell the truth.

1307
01:41:05,167 --> 01:41:07,625
Do you think we are fools
to fall for your lies.

1308
01:41:07,750 --> 01:41:09,667
Now tell us or shall I
put you behind the bars?

1309
01:41:10,250 --> 01:41:11,500
I'll shall confess.

1310
01:41:11,792 --> 01:41:14,042
I tried replacing the
bullets in inspector's gun.

1311
01:41:14,542 --> 01:41:15,875
I was all set to confess...

1312
01:41:16,625 --> 01:41:19,667
...but Vaathiyar's hench
men abducted my daughter.

1313
01:41:27,958 --> 01:41:28,958
Auto...

1314
01:41:30,292 --> 01:41:31,708
There she comes. You leave.

1315
01:41:32,708 --> 01:41:34,333
Stop.

1316
01:41:35,792 --> 01:41:36,708
Hey!

1317
01:41:37,083 --> 01:41:39,208
My daughter reached home
safe as I lied to you.

1318
01:41:39,208 --> 01:41:40,500
My daughter is very dear to me.

1319
01:41:40,708 --> 01:41:43,667
- Please save my family.
- Get up! - Get up!

1320
01:41:46,333 --> 01:41:50,042
Who is this Vaathiyar? Re-
investigate all his cases.

1321
01:41:50,292 --> 01:41:52,208
- Does he think we are fools?
- Ok sir.

1322
01:41:55,792 --> 01:41:58,167
- Bro, here.
- Give it .

1323
01:42:06,208 --> 01:42:08,292
Why are you getting into
unnecessary issues?

1324
01:42:08,833 --> 01:42:11,542
- What now?
- Why did you kidnap the police constable's daughter?

1325
01:42:11,542 --> 01:42:14,375
- Which Police constable?
- Did you think that was smart?

1326
01:42:14,708 --> 01:42:15,792
What are you talking about?

1327
01:42:16,542 --> 01:42:17,208
What is it?

1328
01:42:18,208 --> 01:42:19,083
What is it?

1329
01:42:19,125 --> 01:42:21,792
I did request you to be
calm for a little while.

1330
01:42:22,083 --> 01:42:25,333
Nobody would have believed if the police
constable had confessed during the investigation.

1331
01:42:25,333 --> 01:42:28,375
- But now since you kidnapped her daughter...
- Whose daughter?

1332
01:42:29,333 --> 01:42:30,708
So wasn't it us who kidnapped?

1333
01:42:30,750 --> 01:42:35,083
Why do you doubt me? Have I ever
done anything without his orders?

1334
01:42:35,167 --> 01:42:37,708
You've been asking the same thing.
We didn't do it!

1335
01:42:38,833 --> 01:42:40,583
- Did you see her off safely?
- Yes sir.

1336
01:42:40,917 --> 01:42:43,500
- We took her and drove around the place
couple of times and then left her go. - Ok

1337
01:42:43,542 --> 01:42:45,125
- You guys leave.
- Ok sir.

1338
01:42:48,583 --> 01:42:50,875
Sir, that was awesome.

1339
01:42:51,625 --> 01:42:55,375
If Muruganandam had confessed earlier,
they would have tried to find faults.

1340
01:42:55,958 --> 01:43:00,042
But kidnapping his daughter
was the icing on the cake.

1341
01:43:00,083 --> 01:43:02,792
Vaathiyar is trapped
and we too are safe.

1342
01:43:04,417 --> 01:43:06,083
But this won't be
enough to stop them.

1343
01:43:06,792 --> 01:43:08,667
We should make them suffer even more.

1344
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:10,667
How dare they mess
with the cops?

1345
01:43:12,292 --> 01:43:14,000
He isn't that worthy.

1346
01:43:15,083 --> 01:43:16,750
Let me get back to the job...

1347
01:43:17,833 --> 01:43:18,625
Do one thing...

1348
01:43:19,167 --> 01:43:21,583
You come to the commission office
on Monday. We'll discuss there.

1349
01:43:21,625 --> 01:43:23,375
Give it to me.
Listen Sethupathi...

1350
01:43:23,583 --> 01:43:27,667
Your re-appointment is confirmed. Shave
and show up on Monday. Now hang up.

1351
01:43:29,042 --> 01:43:30,625
Stop beating around the bush.

1352
01:43:31,458 --> 01:43:33,458
We shouldn't have mercy on him.

1353
01:43:34,167 --> 01:43:37,458
He is tricking us when he has lot of
troubles. Imagine if he is back on duty.

1354
01:43:37,917 --> 01:43:38,875
He won't spare us.

1355
01:43:39,708 --> 01:43:41,625
We should overtake him
before his next plan.

1356
01:43:43,333 --> 01:43:46,458
We must make him suffer for life.
Leave that to me.

1357
01:43:47,125 --> 01:43:48,583
I'll destroy him
without a trace.

1358
01:43:52,917 --> 01:43:54,042
Do it.

1359
01:44:14,792 --> 01:44:17,583
Hey! What is it?

1360
01:44:18,375 --> 01:44:19,042
What is it?

1361
01:44:20,750 --> 01:44:21,792
Nothing officer.

1362
01:44:27,333 --> 01:44:29,458
- Ok start.
- Dude, cops.

1363
01:44:32,292 --> 01:44:33,042
What is it?

1364
01:44:40,792 --> 01:44:43,250
Attack him. Yes... Attack!

1365
01:44:43,875 --> 01:44:46,208
Attack him. Yes... Attack!

1366
01:44:47,083 --> 01:44:48,500
Careful!

1367
01:44:49,667 --> 01:44:50,292
Hold this.

1368
01:44:53,792 --> 01:44:54,417
Sir....

1369
01:44:56,292 --> 01:44:58,208
Start the vehicle. Leave...

1370
01:45:25,583 --> 01:45:26,750
We'll get them!

1371
01:45:39,875 --> 01:45:41,417
Stop. Stop!

1372
01:45:48,750 --> 01:45:51,750
- Listen... what happened?
- Nothing sir.

1373
01:45:52,333 --> 01:45:53,375
Did the acid spill on you?

1374
01:45:53,458 --> 01:45:54,583
Idiot. Get down.

1375
01:45:54,792 --> 01:45:56,958
- It's ok sir.
- I said get down.

1376
01:45:57,208 --> 01:45:58,167
Auto hold on.

1377
01:45:59,833 --> 01:46:00,875
I said get down. Now!

1378
01:46:01,958 --> 01:46:04,458
- Sir, it's fine.
- Auto hold on.

1379
01:46:04,917 --> 01:46:06,667
Get in. Go to the hospital.

1380
01:46:06,833 --> 01:46:09,458
- You be careful sir.
- I'll be fine. You go.

1381
01:46:09,500 --> 01:46:10,042
Call me.

1382
01:46:19,458 --> 01:46:20,042
Tell me.

1383
01:46:21,708 --> 01:46:22,708
Listen, be clear.

1384
01:46:22,917 --> 01:46:24,750
Someone is there outside.

1385
01:46:25,083 --> 01:46:27,000
I can't understand. Say it clearly.

1386
01:46:27,750 --> 01:46:29,250
There are men all
around the house.

1387
01:46:29,583 --> 01:46:30,875
Don't worry! Don't worry!

1388
01:46:31,083 --> 01:46:33,292
Nothing is going to happen.
I'm on my way.

1389
01:46:33,333 --> 01:46:35,083
- No, don't come.
- I'm coming.

1390
01:46:35,167 --> 01:46:36,917
I am scared.

1391
01:46:37,542 --> 01:46:40,750
No. If you get scared, the
kids will too get scared.

1392
01:46:42,583 --> 01:46:44,875
Listen to me. Take the kids
and go to the bedroom.

1393
01:46:45,875 --> 01:46:48,458
- Mom.
- Have you got inside?

1394
01:46:49,542 --> 01:46:52,125
Lock all the windows.

1395
01:46:52,542 --> 01:46:54,417
Nothing is going to happen.
I am with you.

1396
01:46:54,625 --> 01:46:57,417
- Don't worry dear.
- Give the phone to Maran.

1397
01:46:57,542 --> 01:46:59,958
- For what?
- I said give the phone to Maran.

1398
01:47:01,333 --> 01:47:03,333
- Maraa, are you afraid?
- Dad

1399
01:47:03,625 --> 01:47:05,542
- No dad.
- Listen to daddy.

1400
01:47:06,500 --> 01:47:07,000
Ok?

1401
01:47:08,875 --> 01:47:09,750
Ok dad.

1402
01:47:09,917 --> 01:47:11,042
Give the phone to mom.

1403
01:47:11,833 --> 01:47:12,292
Hello.

1404
01:47:13,458 --> 01:47:15,333
Where is Maran headed to?

1405
01:47:15,958 --> 01:47:18,417
I'll tell you what will
happen in the next 10 mins.

1406
01:47:18,750 --> 01:47:20,667
So, stop worrying
and listen to me.

1407
01:47:20,708 --> 01:47:22,167
I'll be back.

1408
01:47:25,750 --> 01:47:28,833
Go somewhere where they can
hear you and speak as I say.

1409
01:47:29,125 --> 01:47:29,625
Go.

1410
01:47:30,208 --> 01:47:32,708
Mommy!

1411
01:47:32,708 --> 01:47:34,667
I'm on my way.

1412
01:47:35,875 --> 01:47:36,917
Come on.

1413
01:47:38,458 --> 01:47:40,042
Wait. Get behind me.

1414
01:47:47,458 --> 01:47:49,208
Dear, come here.

1415
01:47:49,583 --> 01:47:52,708
What are you doing with her.
Look what Maran is up to.

1416
01:47:53,250 --> 01:47:53,875
Listen...

1417
01:47:54,792 --> 01:47:57,667
- Sethupathi is inside.
- Let's leave.

1418
01:47:58,750 --> 01:47:59,542
How did he?

1419
01:47:59,958 --> 01:48:03,042
Now come, I can't control him.

1420
01:48:04,208 --> 01:48:04,750
Hold on.

1421
01:48:07,958 --> 01:48:08,417
Done.

1422
01:48:08,917 --> 01:48:10,625
Let's leave.

1423
01:48:11,917 --> 01:48:12,625
Wait.

1424
01:48:17,167 --> 01:48:18,167
- Hey
- Yes tell me.

1425
01:48:18,833 --> 01:48:20,333
- He is at home.
- Who?

1426
01:48:21,083 --> 01:48:22,125
- Sethupathi.
- Bro...

1427
01:48:22,417 --> 01:48:23,708
No chance. He must be here.

1428
01:48:23,917 --> 01:48:27,542
- I can hear his wife talking to him.
- He was chasing us just now. He can't be there.

1429
01:48:27,792 --> 01:48:28,333
Fool!

1430
01:48:30,208 --> 01:48:31,417
They won't leave....

1431
01:48:33,042 --> 01:48:36,542
- They'll come back knowing that I'm not there.
- I'm scared.

1432
01:48:36,833 --> 01:48:40,208
- He is here.
- He was chasing us. There is no way he can be there.

1433
01:48:40,667 --> 01:48:42,292
- Confirm?
- Confirm.

1434
01:48:42,625 --> 01:48:44,958
- Confirm?
- Believe me bro.

1435
01:48:44,958 --> 01:48:45,583
Hang up.

1436
01:48:47,958 --> 01:48:49,625
She is bluffing. Break the door.

1437
01:48:50,083 --> 01:48:51,125
How dare she?

1438
01:48:51,625 --> 01:48:53,583
They are breaking the door.

1439
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:55,125
Ok. Fine!

1440
01:48:55,375 --> 01:48:57,792
Break it. Come on!

1441
01:49:00,167 --> 01:49:04,042
- They are breaking in.
- I am with you. Nothing will happen.

1442
01:49:04,208 --> 01:49:04,917
- Go!
- Break it!

1443
01:49:07,375 --> 01:49:10,250
- Break it.
- They are in.

1444
01:49:10,500 --> 01:49:12,333
Don't worry. Don't look
like you are scared.

1445
01:49:12,333 --> 01:49:13,875
- Move
- Please come.

1446
01:49:17,917 --> 01:49:18,708
Dear...

1447
01:49:19,292 --> 01:49:22,083
Dear, please come.

1448
01:49:22,708 --> 01:49:25,917
Please come. Our son
is so mischievous.

1449
01:49:28,917 --> 01:49:30,583
Staging a play is it?

1450
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:32,708
Who is on the call?
Your husband, right?

1451
01:49:33,708 --> 01:49:35,208
Listen inspector...

1452
01:49:35,208 --> 01:49:37,500
Do you want to hear the screams
of your dying wife and kids?

1453
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,000
Hey, has Maran arrived?

1454
01:49:42,750 --> 01:49:43,958
Put the phone on speakers.

1455
01:49:46,333 --> 01:49:47,125
Maraa...

1456
01:49:47,708 --> 01:49:49,625
now hold it firmly and shoot.

1457
01:50:01,875 --> 01:50:04,625
If any of them takes one step forward,
shoot right on their forehead.

1458
01:50:13,333 --> 01:50:14,500
Hold him.

1459
01:50:14,792 --> 01:50:15,583
Hold him.

1460
01:50:16,083 --> 01:50:18,417
Run! Run!

1461
01:50:18,542 --> 01:50:19,458
Warn your husband.

1462
01:50:19,500 --> 01:50:21,958
He'll be here in 10 mins. Why
don't you warn him in person?

1463
01:50:22,125 --> 01:50:23,375
- So wait..
- Warn him!

1464
01:50:44,917 --> 01:50:45,875
What happened?

1465
01:50:45,917 --> 01:50:46,500
Uncle...

1466
01:50:49,375 --> 01:50:50,250
They escaped.

1467
01:50:51,250 --> 01:50:53,042
I should blame myself
for believing in you.

1468
01:50:53,083 --> 01:50:53,917
Good for nothing.

1469
01:50:54,167 --> 01:50:55,125
How can you let him go?

1470
01:50:55,167 --> 01:50:56,375
He shouldn't get back his job.

1471
01:50:57,542 --> 01:51:00,292
- Isn't the guy whom he shot in the hospital? Finish him.
- Ok uncle.

1472
01:51:00,333 --> 01:51:01,333
Finish him!

1473
01:51:01,667 --> 01:51:04,167
Before I reach home, give me
the news that he is dead.

1474
01:51:04,333 --> 01:51:05,542
- Ok uncle.
- Now go finish!

1475
01:51:06,042 --> 01:51:09,250
Get lost! I can do nothing with you guys.
Get lost! I'll find someone else.

1476
01:51:11,167 --> 01:51:12,500
Where are you guys?

1477
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:26,958
It's Sethu.

1478
01:51:28,208 --> 01:51:29,417
Had your food darling?

1479
01:51:32,750 --> 01:51:33,875
Are the kids asleep?

1480
01:51:35,417 --> 01:51:35,958
Ok fine.

1481
01:52:01,917 --> 01:52:02,583
I guessed it.

1482
01:52:03,958 --> 01:52:06,042
Now why waste time trying
to finish off the boy?

1483
01:53:04,083 --> 01:53:05,750
Come on. Run!

1484
01:53:10,792 --> 01:53:11,792
Come on.

1485
01:53:12,417 --> 01:53:13,250
Break it open.

1486
01:53:16,667 --> 01:53:17,667
Now make it quick!

1487
01:53:18,208 --> 01:53:19,042
Break it!

1488
01:53:22,833 --> 01:53:24,125
Run! Quick!

1489
01:53:37,250 --> 01:53:38,458
Go slit his throat! Get in.

1490
01:54:04,708 --> 01:54:05,958
I've already warned you!

1491
01:54:06,417 --> 01:54:08,167
Don't give that look,
it's hilarious.

1492
01:54:08,667 --> 01:54:09,333
Finish him.

1493
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:36,417
Sir...

1494
01:54:36,708 --> 01:54:37,875
Let's talk. What do you say?

1495
01:54:39,417 --> 01:54:42,667
Sir no, it hurts. No
sir, please don't.

1496
01:54:42,750 --> 01:54:45,292
Sir no, it hurts. No sir, please don't.

1497
01:54:45,875 --> 01:54:47,125
It hurts. No sir, please don't.

1498
01:54:47,208 --> 01:54:49,042
Oh my god. It hurts.

1499
01:54:49,292 --> 01:54:51,750
Oh my god! Karuppu!

1500
01:54:53,208 --> 01:54:55,583
Karuppu, where are you?

1501
01:55:00,333 --> 01:55:01,708
There he comes, the murderer.

1502
01:55:01,833 --> 01:55:03,042
Don't shout or else I'll stab!

1503
01:55:05,583 --> 01:55:07,042
Sir, do not advance.

1504
01:55:07,417 --> 01:55:08,583
Or else I'll...

1505
01:55:08,750 --> 01:55:09,792
Sir please do not advance.

1506
01:55:09,792 --> 01:55:11,292
I've nothing to do with it.

1507
01:55:14,208 --> 01:55:15,292
You better leave.

1508
01:55:15,958 --> 01:55:17,292
Your hands are trembling.

1509
01:55:19,042 --> 01:55:21,167
- Sir.
- You better leave.

1510
01:55:22,167 --> 01:55:23,875
I won't hurt you.

1511
01:55:25,958 --> 01:55:26,708
Now leave.

1512
01:55:26,792 --> 01:55:27,667
Oh my god!

1513
01:55:27,917 --> 01:55:29,542
He just slit my child's throat!

1514
01:55:29,750 --> 01:55:31,875
Nothing to worry. Come on.

1515
01:55:31,958 --> 01:55:33,375
Nothing to worry!

1516
01:55:33,583 --> 01:55:35,542
Come now. It's nothing.

1517
01:55:35,625 --> 01:55:36,583
Doctor!

1518
01:55:37,417 --> 01:55:38,583
Doctor!

1519
01:55:41,375 --> 01:55:42,500
Doctor!

1520
01:55:42,667 --> 01:55:45,125
Make it fast. Please treat him.

1521
01:55:45,458 --> 01:55:47,833
- Careful!
- Move him quickly.

1522
01:55:47,875 --> 01:55:49,917
How could he do this?

1523
01:55:52,375 --> 01:55:53,667
Look at my poor son!

1524
01:55:57,083 --> 01:55:59,875
Why? Why would you guys
hurt him like this?

1525
01:56:01,417 --> 01:56:02,917
My dear son!

1526
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:05,500
Is it true that some unidentified
gang tried to kill you?

1527
01:56:05,583 --> 01:56:07,625
Was it Inspector
Sethupathi who shot you?

1528
01:56:08,292 --> 01:56:11,042
It is true that the inspector
took me in for an inquiry.

1529
01:56:11,833 --> 01:56:13,583
Everyone claims that he shot me.

1530
01:56:14,208 --> 01:56:15,500
But he didn't shoot me.

1531
01:56:16,083 --> 01:56:19,333
I saw his gun fall off from
his hands and it fired.

1532
01:56:20,792 --> 01:56:23,375
When I was at the brink of losing my
life, he was the one who save me.

1533
01:56:24,083 --> 01:56:25,208
He is good hearted.

1534
01:56:25,500 --> 01:56:27,042
It was us who committed a mistake.

1535
01:56:27,875 --> 01:56:30,292
All these days, the news was
that you shot him.

1536
01:56:30,417 --> 01:56:33,042
Now look, the boy himself said
that the gun wasn't in your hands.

1537
01:56:33,375 --> 01:56:34,583
I was ill these days

1538
01:56:35,042 --> 01:56:37,375
- No. He is lying.
- Nothing else.

1539
01:56:37,417 --> 01:56:38,583
The gun never fell off.
It was with me.

1540
01:56:41,375 --> 01:56:44,208
The boy has changed his words!

1541
01:56:47,958 --> 01:56:49,083
Greetings sir.

1542
01:56:49,542 --> 01:56:52,542
- The boy who was admitted in the hospital..
- I know, what else?

1543
01:56:52,750 --> 01:56:54,500
The case is now in the
hands of Sethupathi

1544
01:56:55,042 --> 01:56:56,417
And he will be furious for sure.

1545
01:56:56,667 --> 01:56:57,875
There is no clue as to what he'll do.

1546
01:56:58,000 --> 01:56:59,167
So...

1547
01:56:59,750 --> 01:57:01,333
- you better surrender...
- Hey!

1548
01:57:01,875 --> 01:57:02,750
How dare you?

1549
01:57:03,542 --> 01:57:04,417
You better leave.

1550
01:57:04,458 --> 01:57:06,625
- Listen, I'm saying this for our safety.
- So?

1551
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:11,333
I've finished off two police
men and I'm still wandering free.

1552
01:57:11,875 --> 01:57:14,208
No matter what charges he presses
against us. He can't do anything.

1553
01:57:14,208 --> 01:57:18,000
When he had an arrest
warrant he made you suffer.

1554
01:57:18,917 --> 01:57:21,042
So there is no guarantee
he will arrest...

1555
01:57:21,333 --> 01:57:22,333
he is a freak!

1556
01:57:22,625 --> 01:57:24,458
He can do anything.

1557
01:57:24,833 --> 01:57:27,458
I said what I felt is right.
I am leaving.

1558
01:57:55,958 --> 01:57:57,583
Why is there petrol everywhere?

1559
01:57:58,708 --> 01:58:00,458
Guys, where are you?

1560
01:58:02,458 --> 01:58:03,167
Mathi...

1561
01:58:03,375 --> 01:58:04,500
Mathi, where are you?

1562
01:58:07,833 --> 01:58:09,125
The door is also locked.

1563
01:58:12,375 --> 01:58:13,542
Who is it?

1564
01:58:24,542 --> 01:58:25,333
No don't.

1565
01:58:25,625 --> 01:58:26,583
Listen to me.

1566
01:58:27,792 --> 01:58:28,917
What are you guys up to?

1567
01:58:29,167 --> 01:58:30,500
Tell me. What are
you guys up to?

1568
01:58:31,083 --> 01:58:31,667
No don't it.

1569
01:58:32,125 --> 01:58:33,375
