1
00:02:18,002 --> 00:02:19,460
Water...

2
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:22,668
Bakka, water...

3
00:02:25,668 --> 00:02:26,744
Bakka!

4
00:02:34,744 --> 00:02:35,431
Kesar...

5
00:02:44,431 --> 00:02:47,585
Hey, hey..
Ae Kesar!

6
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:51,830
Don't give up Kesar.
I can feel the dampness

7
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:53,334
We will find water.
Get up Kesar

8
00:02:55,334 --> 00:02:59,648
Don't strain your mind.
This heat is driving you mad

9
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:04,306
Don't give up Kesar.
We will find water

10
00:03:05,306 --> 00:03:08,138
You don't believe me!

11
00:03:09,138 --> 00:03:11,584
How do I believe you, Bakka?

12
00:03:13,584 --> 00:03:15,233
Your tongue is also parched

13
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:23,539
This child inside me needs water

14
00:03:24,539 --> 00:03:30,080
Get water for my child, Bakka

15
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:54,804
I, Bakka- the God of water

16
00:03:55,804 --> 00:03:57,392
I give water to all

17
00:04:30,392 --> 00:04:35,440
O Goddess Meledi! Have mercy..
Give me water!

18
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,925
We live in the
wilderness of Kutch

19
00:06:25,925 --> 00:06:28,524
The vast silence and
emptiness of the desert

20
00:06:28,524 --> 00:06:30,264
Sends shivers
in the body

21
00:06:32,264 --> 00:06:34,461
Faraway on the horizon,
a sand storm is brewing

22
00:06:37,461 --> 00:06:39,321
Sometimes, saline
water from the sea...

23
00:06:39,321 --> 00:06:40,223
...makes its way
into the desert

24
00:06:41,223 --> 00:06:45,848
Creating a lake of saline water
in the midst of the desert

25
00:06:46,848 --> 00:06:49,059
'Flamingo' – a beautiful,
migratory bird

26
00:06:50,059 --> 00:06:54,384
That flies thousands of
miles from home, to come here

27
00:06:55,384 --> 00:06:59,863
Perhaps, this land feels like
home to them

28
00:07:02,863 --> 00:07:06,314
People living in the desert
know how to survive

29
00:07:07,314 --> 00:07:10,896
But these birds
are our guests

30
00:07:12,896 --> 00:07:15,509
I am Bakka.
People call me 'God of Water'

31
00:07:16,509 --> 00:07:17,473
I live in this desert

32
00:07:18,473 --> 00:07:20,918
And quench
everyone's thirst

33
00:08:09,918 --> 00:08:37,491
Jal , Jal, Jal
(Chanting for water)

34
00:08:46,491 --> 00:08:51,240
We pray to you O God...
(Chanting)

35
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:57,461
Give us water,
Give us life

36
00:10:30,461 --> 00:10:32,004
At last! This is where
water is hiding..

37
00:10:33,004 --> 00:10:35,255
Chief!
We will find water here

38
00:10:36,255 --> 00:10:38,764
You found water?
- Yeah

39
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:42,458
We found water!
Long live Bakka!

40
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:46,682
C'mon say it...

41
00:10:48,682 --> 00:10:51,649
Kheema Bhai! He has found water.
Now say, 'long live Bakka'!

42
00:10:51,649 --> 00:10:52,250
Nonsense, Where's water?

43
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:57,124
If there is any..go jump in it
and die!

44
00:10:58,124 --> 00:11:01,581
This Rakla has gone mad...

45
00:11:01,581 --> 00:11:04,527
Bakka..
There is no water in the desert!

46
00:11:05,527 --> 00:11:08,139
This burning desert can
only take away life..

47
00:11:09,139 --> 00:11:10,331
..doesn't give life

48
00:11:12,331 --> 00:11:13,883
Bakka..

49
00:11:13,883 --> 00:11:16,541
You have done
this many times..

50
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:18,100
..beating drums in the
name of finding water

51
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:21,153
Tell us if there is no water

52
00:11:22,153 --> 00:11:24,705
Chief! Swear on you...

53
00:11:24,705 --> 00:11:26,626
..we will definitely
find water here

54
00:11:26,626 --> 00:11:28,123
C'mon now!
Say long live Bakka!

55
00:11:30,123 --> 00:11:33,956
Long live Bakka!

56
00:12:34,956 --> 00:12:36,994
Madam, photo...

57
00:12:52,994 --> 00:12:56,640
This is called ‘Flamingo city'

58
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:05,244
(Russian) Wow! It's unbelievable.
Here are the long legged Flamingos

59
00:13:06,244 --> 00:13:10,284
Only English, madam
No German, No Russian.

60
00:13:10,284 --> 00:13:12,159
We call them 'Surkhab' madam

61
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:16,409
The long, pink-legged 'Surkhab'

62
00:13:22,409 --> 00:13:24,793
(Russian) So many!
- Noga?

63
00:13:24,793 --> 00:13:27,451
Ma'am, where?

64
00:13:27,451 --> 00:13:28,006
What the ...!

65
00:13:29,006 --> 00:13:31,991
Madam, wait. Listen.
It's dangerous...

66
00:13:31,991 --> 00:13:33,741
..there are
snakes out here

67
00:13:34,741 --> 00:13:37,534
Can't we stay here?
- No, no, madam

68
00:13:37,534 --> 00:13:39,576
They will run
- Run?

69
00:13:39,576 --> 00:13:42,826
Oh..you mean fly
- Yes, same thing

70
00:13:42,826 --> 00:13:45,798
First actually they run,
and then they fly

71
00:13:45,798 --> 00:13:48,933
Actually, water is a big problem
in the desert

72
00:13:48,933 --> 00:13:50,123
Sea water comes
and goes..

73
00:13:51,123 --> 00:13:56,201
..and rain water comes & goes
because the sand sucks, like...

74
00:13:57,201 --> 00:13:58,976
Suck... I mean go
- Where?

75
00:13:58,976 --> 00:14:01,860
Where suck?
Inside the earth

76
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,126
So, no water

77
00:14:04,126 --> 00:14:06,381
So, now there's water,
but later no water

78
00:14:07,381 --> 00:14:08,740
So, the water problem

79
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:10,341
Madam! Water..

80
00:14:13,341 --> 00:14:15,405
You weirdo!
Why are you scaring her?

81
00:14:15,405 --> 00:14:17,282
Her legs look colorful
through this glass

82
00:14:27,282 --> 00:14:30,823
See madam,
this is your area

83
00:14:31,823 --> 00:14:32,243
Here we are

84
00:14:33,243 --> 00:14:35,447
This is your area & your tent

85
00:14:35,447 --> 00:14:37,030
Camels are here,
birds are here

86
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:39,197
Water is here

87
00:14:39,197 --> 00:14:41,614
You are the queen of this
area, madam

88
00:14:46,614 --> 00:14:50,490
Why are you ogling at her,
you idiots?

89
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:52,043
Haven't you seen a
white chick before..

90
00:14:53,043 --> 00:14:55,197
..in those foreign CDs
Have shown you twice..

91
00:14:55,197 --> 00:14:59,197
Porn film!
They showed it all!

92
00:15:09,197 --> 00:15:10,432
Ae Bakka!

93
00:15:11,432 --> 00:15:13,063
Who's there?
- Chief!

94
00:15:14,063 --> 00:15:17,446
You have reached the bottom
of the earth. Where's water?

95
00:15:18,446 --> 00:15:20,054
We'll definitely find water

96
00:15:21,054 --> 00:15:22,927
The earthquake in Gujarat...

97
00:15:22,927 --> 00:15:25,599
...has messed up the entire
system of this place

98
00:15:25,599 --> 00:15:27,445
But we'll surely find water..

99
00:15:27,445 --> 00:15:29,400
Just got to dig deeper

100
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,446
She's here to make
a film!

101
00:15:32,446 --> 00:15:33,321
With us?

102
00:15:34,321 --> 00:15:36,703
Are you sure?
- Yeah. I swear!

103
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:40,446
Great! Did you tell anyone else?
- No

104
00:15:41,446 --> 00:15:42,894
..Just him

105
00:15:43,894 --> 00:15:44,116
Sit!

106
00:15:45,116 --> 00:15:46,660
Don't utter a word to
anyone else - Okay

107
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:52,945
Is she really from those foreign CDs?
- Yes

108
00:15:52,945 --> 00:15:57,739
Great! All men in the village
will be ready to drop their pants..

109
00:15:57,739 --> 00:15:59,205
Wait till your wife Lajo
finds out...

110
00:16:01,205 --> 00:16:02,985
Don't tell anyone...

111
00:16:02,985 --> 00:16:04,063
Doesn't take much to create
a ruckus in this village

112
00:16:05,063 --> 00:16:07,283
We will just take Bakka along.
He's our friend!

113
00:16:08,283 --> 00:16:10,215
Ae Bakka,
get here. Quick!

114
00:16:11,215 --> 00:16:13,370
We'll spend the
night in the desert

115
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:15,133
Hurry up...

116
00:16:21,133 --> 00:16:23,741
A madam from those foreign CDs
has come here!- Really?

117
00:16:24,741 --> 00:16:26,489
I will get your film
made with her

118
00:16:28,489 --> 00:16:30,837
Rakla, I am
not interested

119
00:16:30,837 --> 00:16:33,157
Get my film made with Kesar.
I love her

120
00:16:34,157 --> 00:16:37,110
Have you gone nuts?
You will get us all screwed

121
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:40,445
Stop dreaming about a girl
from the enemy village!!

122
00:16:40,445 --> 00:16:42,734
Stop being horny
about Kesar

123
00:16:42,734 --> 00:16:43,025
Forget local..

124
00:16:44,025 --> 00:16:45,056
Come; sample the foreign
stuff with us

125
00:16:46,056 --> 00:16:49,539
I heard she
wears a red bra

126
00:16:49,539 --> 00:16:52,442
Looks like a fresh
rose in the dry desert

127
00:16:54,442 --> 00:16:55,654
No, Rakla

128
00:16:55,654 --> 00:16:57,958
If I don't find
water this time..

129
00:16:57,958 --> 00:17:00,275
..the chief will make me wear a bra
& parade me through the village

130
00:17:01,275 --> 00:17:02,982
Come if you wish
or go to hell

131
00:17:03,982 --> 00:17:05,259
You don't
tell anybody

132
00:17:09,259 --> 00:17:13,380
Ae Manga, Ae Parnami,
Ae Rakla

133
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:18,496
You are off to meet that
‘foreign chick' without telling me

134
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:20,955
Who the hell...told him?

135
00:17:20,955 --> 00:17:22,385
Sorry brother.

136
00:17:24,385 --> 00:17:27,898
He is so old
Won't be able to do anything

137
00:17:27,898 --> 00:17:29,981
Ask your mother, who is old!
Take me there..

138
00:17:29,981 --> 00:17:31,632
..I will show what I can do

139
00:17:31,632 --> 00:17:34,765
Vela Bhai! Didn't you just
turn grandfather? - Yes

140
00:17:34,765 --> 00:17:37,281
Got a grandson and still
drooling over young chicks!

141
00:17:37,281 --> 00:17:40,398
So what! Am young at heart
-Fine, come

142
00:17:40,398 --> 00:17:42,847
Tell me now
if anybody else knows

143
00:17:42,847 --> 00:17:44,690
No, no I swear
- Okay. Let's go then

144
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:46,066
Rakla Bhai!
I just got married

145
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,656
Introduce me to
the ‘foreign chick' for sure

146
00:17:48,656 --> 00:17:50,284
Why?

147
00:17:50,284 --> 00:17:53,321
My wife is off to her parents
I need some entertainment

148
00:17:53,321 --> 00:17:55,694
So, use your
hands for entertainment

149
00:18:21,694 --> 00:18:25,294
Shut your eyes
- And miss the sight! No!

150
00:18:25,294 --> 00:18:27,836
Practice at home first,
then think of riding a wild camel

151
00:18:27,836 --> 00:18:34,500
Wow! She is pink
like a flamingo

152
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,656
Vela Bhai, come out
of your fantasies

153
00:18:36,656 --> 00:18:39,569
It's time for you to go up....
not ‘up and down'. Bloody old man!

154
00:21:03,569 --> 00:21:04,195
Madam...

155
00:21:11,195 --> 00:21:13,194
Earlier these flamingos...

156
00:21:14,194 --> 00:21:16,255
...would come here
in large numbers

157
00:21:17,255 --> 00:21:18,154
Now, the number
has gone down

158
00:21:20,154 --> 00:21:24,598
About 50 miles from here
they still come in huge flocks

159
00:21:25,598 --> 00:21:28,191
Do you want to see?
They are all alive

160
00:21:29,191 --> 00:21:32,163
Yeah, lots of them.
That way..

161
00:21:32,163 --> 00:21:35,534
Yeah! On the other side of
the salt water lake

162
00:21:35,534 --> 00:21:38,568
He's right.
When I was younger...

163
00:21:38,568 --> 00:21:41,944
...there were thousands
of flamingo flocks coming here

164
00:21:42,944 --> 00:21:44,505
Shut up all of you!
Madam is worried

165
00:21:46,505 --> 00:21:48,280
Madam, I know
little English

166
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,675
Earlier, many tourists
came here...

167
00:21:51,675 --> 00:21:53,541
...they used to pay
100 rupees a day

168
00:21:53,541 --> 00:21:56,752
...I will show you
lots of flamingos

169
00:21:56,752 --> 00:22:02,125
(Radio playing folk song)

170
00:22:09,125 --> 00:22:10,674
Madam

171
00:22:10,674 --> 00:22:11,190
Your servant is here

172
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:17,808
Ram Khiladi...
- Why are you bothering madam?

173
00:22:17,808 --> 00:22:19,696
Ram Khiladi...
- Stay away

174
00:22:32,696 --> 00:22:35,338
Look, madam
needs laborers

175
00:22:35,338 --> 00:22:38,756
She'll pay 4 Euro per person.
Equals 250 rupees!

176
00:22:38,756 --> 00:22:40,730
Go and get laborers
from the village.

177
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:44,108
Why four,
madam said five?

178
00:22:45,108 --> 00:22:47,273
Who knows English...
me or you?

179
00:22:47,273 --> 00:22:49,773
She said four
- No, she showed five fingers

180
00:22:49,773 --> 00:22:52,358
She might show
fifty fingers..

181
00:22:52,358 --> 00:22:53,009
...when I say four,
it means four

182
00:22:54,009 --> 00:22:55,189
Anyways, there are
just four fingers in a hand

183
00:22:56,189 --> 00:22:58,913
Look... 1,2,3,4...
finish

184
00:22:58,913 --> 00:23:02,846
And what's this?
- Thumb.. what else?

185
00:23:02,846 --> 00:23:05,027
She is saying work for 4 Euros else
there are many other villages

186
00:23:06,027 --> 00:23:07,936
..we will get as many
laborers as we want

187
00:23:07,936 --> 00:23:09,125
Okay? Go...
- Then why did madam say 5?

188
00:23:10,125 --> 00:23:13,767
Madam, didn't you say five?
- Yes, five. 5 Euros

189
00:23:19,767 --> 00:23:21,907
Won't let me earn a little...
Bastards!

190
00:23:21,907 --> 00:23:23,339
Everyone will get 5 Euro.
Okay?

191
00:23:23,339 --> 00:23:24,741
Now, go and get everyone

192
00:23:24,741 --> 00:23:25,287
You fix the deal now!

193
00:23:36,287 --> 00:23:37,815
See...

194
00:23:37,815 --> 00:23:40,138
Foreign money has
its special sound

195
00:23:40,138 --> 00:23:41,786
Don't pull, it'll tear

196
00:23:42,786 --> 00:23:43,867
Chief!

197
00:23:43,867 --> 00:23:46,508
This foreign money
equals 300 rupees

198
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:50,136
White madam said she'll pay
300 per day to everybody

199
00:23:51,136 --> 00:23:55,502
We can buy water from the enemy
village with the money

200
00:23:55,502 --> 00:23:57,580
You want to be friends
with the enemy village?

201
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:58,355
Drink their water?

202
00:24:01,355 --> 00:24:04,133
Kheema Bhai!
When a man gets the urge...

203
00:24:05,133 --> 00:24:07,814
...who cares if it's the enemy
village or their women

204
00:24:09,814 --> 00:24:11,577
Money is powerful!

205
00:24:11,577 --> 00:24:13,816
Listen... we're
already tired

206
00:24:13,816 --> 00:24:17,625
We trusted Bakka, and now you
got this strange news

207
00:24:17,625 --> 00:24:19,980
We got no water to drink

208
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:21,980
And what's money's
worth without water?

209
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:25,461
Chief! As it is we are not
able to find water...

210
00:24:25,461 --> 00:24:28,784
If the men go and work they
will bring money to the village

211
00:24:28,784 --> 00:24:30,559
My sister is right

212
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:36,948
Kajri, madam is some kind of
'Bird-doctor'. Cries when they die

213
00:24:37,948 --> 00:24:40,184
So tomorrow, I will take
everybody there

214
00:24:40,184 --> 00:24:42,348
Not everyone. Few will go

215
00:24:42,348 --> 00:24:46,309
Sukhiya & Gani
are stoned all day...

216
00:24:46,309 --> 00:24:47,750
Take them for sure
- Yes

217
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:50,576
Look everyone,
wet soil

218
00:24:50,576 --> 00:24:51,713
Oh wow!

219
00:24:53,713 --> 00:24:57,396
It's dry sand. But we'll surely
find water

220
00:24:57,396 --> 00:24:59,227
Idiot! Get water or
die in there

221
00:25:01,227 --> 00:25:02,727
Dare you come out!

222
00:25:22,727 --> 00:25:27,202
Madam, these are cows. In India we
call them 'Mother'. 'Mother of India'!

223
00:25:31,202 --> 00:25:32,988
Gani Bhai

224
00:25:32,988 --> 00:25:35,446
Will you be able to work?
- Yes

225
00:25:35,446 --> 00:25:36,170
Fine, go...

226
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:39,432
Name
- Sukhiya

227
00:25:42,432 --> 00:25:44,230
Hey you... stand properly

228
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:46,625
Manga...
- Yes

229
00:25:46,625 --> 00:25:51,766
Dare you stare at her legs
or elsewhere by yourself...

230
00:25:51,766 --> 00:25:54,009
Greetings!
I am Vela Bhai

231
00:25:55,009 --> 00:25:56,585
Ok, move on...

232
00:25:56,585 --> 00:25:57,565
Parnami..

233
00:25:58,565 --> 00:25:59,261
Parnami..

234
00:26:00,261 --> 00:26:01,641
Ok, who's next?

235
00:26:16,641 --> 00:26:43,289
(Folk song)

236
00:26:46,289 --> 00:26:47,786
You!
What are you doing here?

237
00:26:47,786 --> 00:26:50,097
Where else should I be?
In Afghanistan?

238
00:26:51,097 --> 00:26:53,265
Why did you hit me?
I will bust your head!

239
00:26:54,265 --> 00:26:56,413
Scoundrel! What are you staring at?
Tell me your name?

240
00:26:58,413 --> 00:26:59,303
Write... Rakla

241
00:27:00,303 --> 00:27:03,356
That I know.Give me your full name.
- Rakla Bhai

242
00:27:06,356 --> 00:27:07,080
C'mon... do it...

243
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:17,913
Pull it out. Hurry up!

244
00:27:17,913 --> 00:27:20,347
Hey Manga, give it...

245
00:27:21,347 --> 00:27:24,580
Sukhiya,
don't you want foreign money

246
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:28,412
I don't understand...

247
00:27:29,412 --> 00:27:31,073
...what will they do
with the dead birds?

248
00:27:32,073 --> 00:27:35,522
They will sell the meat...
What else?

249
00:27:35,522 --> 00:27:37,868
You know nothing, uncle

250
00:27:37,868 --> 00:27:40,058
These birds come here from
their country in the winters

251
00:27:41,058 --> 00:27:43,467
Madam wants to save,
not kill them

252
00:27:45,467 --> 00:27:48,567
So, madam will save the birds
and what about humans?

253
00:27:49,567 --> 00:27:51,436
Who will save you all?

254
00:27:53,436 --> 00:27:55,423
Bakka will save you!

255
00:27:55,423 --> 00:27:59,307
Rascal!  What have you done for
your village?

256
00:28:00,307 --> 00:28:02,259
We dug up half the
desert on your word

257
00:28:03,259 --> 00:28:04,980
Where is water?

258
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:07,760
Listen...6 out of 10 times,
I find water

259
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:11,993
Fine!
Don't believe in me!

260
00:28:11,993 --> 00:28:15,766
No Bakka.
It's not that

261
00:28:15,766 --> 00:28:19,005
You keep our hope alive,
that we will get water

262
00:28:20,005 --> 00:28:25,890
Last summer, more humans
than birds died due to lack of water

263
00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:29,330
Even these clouds are biased

264
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:31,813
They rain everywhere
except here

265
00:28:31,813 --> 00:28:35,953
And whatever little rain we get
is sucked up by the desert

266
00:28:35,953 --> 00:28:38,878
Even this water
will dry up, I tell you

267
00:28:38,878 --> 00:28:43,536
True! But why doesn't
anybody come to save us?

268
00:28:50,536 --> 00:28:52,534
Hey let's go...

269
00:28:52,534 --> 00:28:54,876
Manga, come on

270
00:28:55,876 --> 00:28:58,429
Gani Bhai never says
anything good

271
00:29:18,429 --> 00:29:22,055
Lots of birds have died.
These graves will be dug every day

272
00:29:23,055 --> 00:29:27,386
But it's okay.
The birds will keep dying

273
00:29:27,386 --> 00:29:30,950
We will keep digging graves
& getting money...

274
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:34,007
Good.. the rest of our life
will get easier

275
00:29:35,007 --> 00:29:37,762
Why do you want to live off
somebody's death?

276
00:30:01,762 --> 00:30:10,092
Ae Rakla, where is she going so late?
- She is upset about the chicks dying

277
00:31:09,092 --> 00:31:11,954
Hey get up.
Madam is missing

278
00:31:11,954 --> 00:31:14,054
Look around...

279
00:31:15,054 --> 00:31:16,324
Get up

280
00:31:18,324 --> 00:31:19,205
Let's look for her..

281
00:31:59,205 --> 00:32:00,253
Madam...

282
00:32:19,253 --> 00:32:21,269
Kim...

283
00:35:39,269 --> 00:35:42,599
Hey Puniya!
Look, its Bakka!

284
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:45,880
The God of water!

285
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:52,038
There is no water
in your village...

286
00:35:53,038 --> 00:35:55,077
So, you have
come here to die!

287
00:35:56,077 --> 00:35:58,063
You are savoring
the ‘foreign chick'

288
00:36:00,063 --> 00:36:02,983
It takes a man
to savor a woman

289
00:36:06,983 --> 00:36:09,833
Nobody is man enough,
in your village

290
00:36:09,833 --> 00:36:13,230
If you need one from the
enemy village, let me know

291
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:18,579
Bastard!
Just one strike..

292
00:36:18,579 --> 00:36:21,884
...and you will see stars in the
bright desert sun

293
00:36:21,884 --> 00:36:24,001
Stop it Puniya!
Stay in line!

294
00:36:25,001 --> 00:36:26,742
When did I
cross the line?

295
00:36:26,742 --> 00:36:31,244
Here people can kill for water.
It must be clear to this woman now

296
00:36:33,244 --> 00:36:35,016
...and to her well-wisher

297
00:36:37,016 --> 00:36:38,702
Let's go, Puniya

298
00:36:38,702 --> 00:36:41,952
Hey! Be careful in
front of our women

299
00:36:41,952 --> 00:36:43,128
Hey Flamingo!

300
00:36:44,128 --> 00:36:48,320
Stay away... Dare you
come near our well!

301
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,954
Thank you

302
00:37:05,954 --> 00:37:07,164
What is she doing?

303
00:37:15,164 --> 00:37:19,490
Such a loose woman!
Falling over every man...

304
00:37:19,490 --> 00:37:21,777
When will it be my turn?

305
00:37:22,777 --> 00:37:28,219
"The cuckoo sings on a mango tree"
(Folk song)

306
00:37:28,219 --> 00:37:33,264
"My prince sits on the fort wall,
watching” (Folk song)

307
00:37:34,264 --> 00:37:38,998
Be quiet!
-Why be quiet?

308
00:37:38,998 --> 00:37:43,219
The boy has turned 20.
C'mon girls, let's sing...

309
00:37:44,219 --> 00:37:46,505
Shut up!

310
00:37:47,505 --> 00:37:52,686
We are all in trouble
and you are... (Mock sings)

311
00:37:52,686 --> 00:37:56,791
As if we were living
in paradise earlier...

312
00:37:56,791 --> 00:37:58,134
What has
happened now?

313
00:37:58,134 --> 00:37:59,009
Shut up you
illiterate woman!

314
00:38:00,009 --> 00:38:01,469
Stop it
Ae Rakla!

315
00:38:01,469 --> 00:38:06,340
Yes Chief, it's Bakka's fault

316
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:08,313
Shut up Rakla!
It's all because of you

317
00:38:08,313 --> 00:38:09,034
Because of me!

318
00:38:10,034 --> 00:38:12,672
Yes, you were the one
showing us foreign money

319
00:38:12,672 --> 00:38:13,027
Now what...?

320
00:38:14,027 --> 00:38:18,998
Your madam has polluted
the enemy's well

321
00:38:18,998 --> 00:38:23,608
Bakka...
Show your wound

322
00:38:24,608 --> 00:38:27,753
Ae Bakka!
How did this happen?

323
00:38:27,753 --> 00:38:31,992
This wound is a
message from the enemy

324
00:38:32,992 --> 00:38:35,362
If it is,
we will reply to it

325
00:38:35,362 --> 00:38:38,416
These bangles
are our weapons

326
00:38:38,416 --> 00:38:40,588
Not sure of
the village men

327
00:38:40,588 --> 00:38:42,847
But we will definitely answer them
- Yes

328
00:38:42,847 --> 00:38:43,014
Let's go aunty...

329
00:38:44,014 --> 00:38:46,768
We'll draw water
from the enemy's well

330
00:38:46,768 --> 00:38:49,148
How is it their fault?

331
00:38:50,148 --> 00:38:52,608
Bakka had gone
to their village

332
00:38:52,608 --> 00:38:53,588
What?

333
00:38:53,588 --> 00:38:55,835
You went to
the enemy village!

334
00:38:55,835 --> 00:39:01,853
These guys will get us killed.
Take a decision, chief

335
00:39:01,853 --> 00:39:03,898
Yes, I have decided!

336
00:39:04,898 --> 00:39:06,012
Rakla, tell your madam,
from tomorrow..

337
00:39:07,012 --> 00:39:09,612
No man from our village
will work for her

338
00:39:09,612 --> 00:39:13,146
What! Why?
- Why not?

339
00:39:25,146 --> 00:39:26,606
Madam...

340
00:39:26,606 --> 00:39:27,815
Madam...

341
00:39:27,815 --> 00:39:30,105
Stop!
Let's go out

342
00:39:30,105 --> 00:39:33,300
What happened?
- Why are you disturbing them?

343
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:34,748
I want to meet madam

344
00:39:34,748 --> 00:39:36,896
Idiot! She is discussing
something serious

345
00:39:36,896 --> 00:39:38,313
And you are barging in...

346
00:39:38,313 --> 00:39:40,393
You know,
babies are dying?

347
00:39:41,393 --> 00:39:43,467
Whose babies are dying?
- The birds...

348
00:39:44,467 --> 00:39:46,039
You wait...
illiterate person!

349
00:40:03,039 --> 00:40:05,309
Hey what's
happening in there?

350
00:40:10,309 --> 00:40:15,052
In sometime, these birds and
we all will die - What!

351
00:40:18,052 --> 00:40:22,440
The desert is turning
our water salty...

352
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:28,154
So, the algae that grows,
dies and becomes hard

353
00:40:29,154 --> 00:40:36,561
When flamingo chicks eat it...
They choke on it and die

354
00:40:36,561 --> 00:40:38,365
Also, the excessive
salt and algae

355
00:40:39,365 --> 00:40:45,005
...gets deposited on their wings,
making them stiff..

356
00:40:46,005 --> 00:40:49,451
And the birds fly away
leaving their children behind

357
00:40:49,451 --> 00:40:52,842
These poor chicks can't even
fly before they die

358
00:40:53,842 --> 00:40:57,786
See! Such a serious topic these
English people are working on

359
00:40:57,786 --> 00:40:59,893
What is going on?
- I don't know

360
00:40:59,893 --> 00:41:01,668
We all will die?
-Yeah

361
00:41:01,668 --> 00:41:03,994
The birds will die
- Yeah

362
00:41:04,994 --> 00:41:06,436
You will also die?

363
00:41:07,436 --> 00:41:11,755
That's difficult but
you will surely die...

364
00:41:12,755 --> 00:41:13,393
...by my hands!

365
00:41:14,393 --> 00:41:16,684
Nothing... You go.
I will see what's going on

366
00:41:25,684 --> 00:41:27,684
All of us will die, Vela Bhai!

367
00:41:27,684 --> 00:41:29,012
Remember? Mangat Ram died
'coz of a stone in his stomach

368
00:41:30,012 --> 00:41:31,795
Yeah! It was this big

369
00:41:32,795 --> 00:41:36,472
This madam is working
here on this problem

370
00:41:36,472 --> 00:41:37,623
Good, good...
she should

371
00:41:38,623 --> 00:41:41,949
I'll go & see what else they
are talking about - Yeah, go

372
00:41:41,949 --> 00:41:46,253
Parnami, did you hear?
We will all die?

373
00:41:46,253 --> 00:41:48,601
You will go first
- Shut up, you...

374
00:41:49,601 --> 00:41:51,199
All the water has become salty?
- Yes. All of it

375
00:41:52,199 --> 00:41:57,273
Algae becomes hard...
...like a stone

376
00:41:57,273 --> 00:42:01,590
Flamingo chicks eat them and it
gets stuck in their throat

377
00:42:01,590 --> 00:42:05,414
So, they eat that hard
algae & die

378
00:42:05,414 --> 00:42:06,315
We'll all die

379
00:42:08,315 --> 00:42:09,552
Really?
- Yes

380
00:42:09,552 --> 00:42:10,112
Don't forget

381
00:42:12,112 --> 00:42:14,094
Listen everyone...!

382
00:42:14,094 --> 00:42:16,632
Dreaming about the white woman!
- What happened?

383
00:42:16,632 --> 00:42:18,744
Kajri, my sister...
Help me...

384
00:42:39,744 --> 00:42:42,110
She is our guest. So what if
I showed her some concern?

385
00:42:44,110 --> 00:42:47,306
Stop, stop! Hold it

386
00:42:47,306 --> 00:42:50,644
Lost your mind? Look,
white madam is here

387
00:42:54,644 --> 00:42:56,320
Namaste
- Namaste, Namaste

388
00:42:56,320 --> 00:43:00,722
Madam wants to know why
are you beating this beggar?

389
00:43:00,722 --> 00:43:02,820
I am not a beggar.
I am Rakla

390
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:05,130
He was calling out her
name in his sleep...

391
00:43:05,130 --> 00:43:07,041
See, Lajo. She is
going to be his other wife

392
00:43:07,041 --> 00:43:08,554
You scoundrel!

393
00:43:11,554 --> 00:43:20,427
Listen everyone, madam
needs labourers to save the birds

394
00:43:20,427 --> 00:43:22,579
Who will save us?

395
00:43:26,579 --> 00:43:30,019
Answer that...!
Who will save us?

396
00:43:33,019 --> 00:43:34,409
He is right

397
00:43:35,409 --> 00:43:38,739
If the men from other villages
want to work, it's up to them

398
00:43:38,739 --> 00:43:40,054
But no one will
work from here

399
00:43:44,054 --> 00:43:46,512
You are our guest. Have water
- Thank You...

400
00:43:53,512 --> 00:43:54,679
Look, chief

401
00:43:55,679 --> 00:43:57,173
Sweet water is
needed to save the birds

402
00:43:58,173 --> 00:44:01,621
For that, the earth
needs to be dug

403
00:44:01,621 --> 00:44:04,673
These people will
make wells and ponds

404
00:44:04,673 --> 00:44:06,586
And you people
get to earn money

405
00:44:07,586 --> 00:44:11,759
There's no water for us...
Where will they find water for birds?

406
00:44:11,759 --> 00:44:14,139
Tell this to her!

407
00:44:14,139 --> 00:44:18,639
Madam, no...later...

408
00:44:22,639 --> 00:44:25,931
Look, chief.
She is pleading...

409
00:44:25,931 --> 00:44:27,550
...looking for water

410
00:44:27,550 --> 00:44:29,489
She won't carry it back
in the airplane

411
00:44:30,489 --> 00:44:34,307
After the birds leave, water will
be all ours to have

412
00:44:34,307 --> 00:44:35,456
He is right

413
00:44:40,456 --> 00:44:41,034
Fine...

414
00:44:42,034 --> 00:44:44,427
If it's a matter
of saving lives

415
00:44:44,427 --> 00:44:46,679
Then some of our men
will go and work

416
00:44:46,679 --> 00:44:51,699
Long live the chief!
- Wait! Bakka, neither you...

417
00:44:51,699 --> 00:44:54,405
... nor your madam
will go near the enemy village

418
00:44:55,405 --> 00:44:56,601
Congratulations, madam

419
00:44:56,601 --> 00:44:59,471
They've agreed to come
- Thank you

420
00:45:01,471 --> 00:45:02,708
Where are you from, madam?

421
00:45:02,708 --> 00:45:04,565
He's asking, which country
you are from?

422
00:45:06,565 --> 00:45:08,300
She's from Russia
- Where's that?

423
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:13,009
There's no sand there.
Just snow, everywhere

424
00:45:14,009 --> 00:45:15,431
That's why she
is white as snow

425
00:45:17,431 --> 00:45:20,536
We also have snow here.
Do you want to see?

426
00:45:20,536 --> 00:45:22,492
Hey! Don't make
a fool of her

427
00:45:22,492 --> 00:45:24,434
We are dying for water
& you are talking about snow

428
00:45:24,434 --> 00:45:26,603
Yeah, I will show her snow...

429
00:45:35,603 --> 00:45:43,713
(Chant for water)

430
00:45:44,713 --> 00:45:47,340
Ae Rakla!
I have news for you

431
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:49,172
Don't scream!
Calm down

432
00:45:49,172 --> 00:45:52,277
Machine that digs out
water is coming...

433
00:45:53,277 --> 00:45:59,099
"We pray to you, O God!"

434
00:46:00,099 --> 00:46:03,259
"Hear the desperate cries
of our parched souls"

435
00:46:03,259 --> 00:46:11,724
"It's a desert of burning hopes
With raised arms & imploring eyes"

436
00:46:11,724 --> 00:46:20,780
"We gaze at the cloudless sky
Give us water, give us life."

437
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:30,152
Come...

438
00:46:31,152 --> 00:46:33,103
That's Richard
and she is Kim

439
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:48,101
"We pray to you...
Give us water, give us life"

440
00:46:53,101 --> 00:46:54,713
Ae Bakka!

441
00:46:54,713 --> 00:46:58,407
The machine has
come to find water

442
00:46:58,407 --> 00:47:02,713
Look for another job!
Nobody needs you now

443
00:47:02,713 --> 00:47:06,211
Fine go! This machine
will give you water

444
00:47:07,211 --> 00:47:09,824
Even I don't want to
listen to your abuses

445
00:47:09,824 --> 00:47:13,048
Get lost now!
Get lost!

446
00:47:14,048 --> 00:47:16,753
What happened?
Even you don't need me now?

447
00:47:16,753 --> 00:47:18,143
Fine, Go!
Roam in the desert alone

448
00:47:20,143 --> 00:47:21,621
Idiot!

449
00:48:05,621 --> 00:48:07,418
How will this machine dig water?

450
00:48:09,418 --> 00:48:11,876
Come, let's ask sir...

451
00:48:14,876 --> 00:48:18,701
Sir...
- Hey! Keep your hands away

452
00:48:19,701 --> 00:48:21,985
How does this machine work?

453
00:48:21,985 --> 00:48:26,333
Grrr...grrrrrrrrrrrr...
grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr

454
00:48:26,333 --> 00:48:27,199
That's how!

455
00:48:28,199 --> 00:48:30,916
Now, shut up & sit quietly
- Sir is joking!

456
00:48:30,916 --> 00:48:33,402
Ram Khiladi, take them away.
They are chewing my brain

457
00:48:33,402 --> 00:48:39,250
It's a computerized machine
It will dig a well overnight!

458
00:48:48,250 --> 00:48:51,889
Don't create a ruckus.
Be quiet! It's for you people...

459
00:49:33,889 --> 00:49:35,579
Hail 'Goddess Dashamata'!

460
00:50:19,579 --> 00:50:20,414
Machine is here...

461
00:50:21,414 --> 00:50:23,824
But they won't
find water here

462
00:50:23,824 --> 00:50:25,271
What are you saying?

463
00:50:26,271 --> 00:50:27,661
Rakla, there's
no water here

464
00:50:28,661 --> 00:50:29,161
You saw the black
rock we found

465
00:50:30,161 --> 00:50:32,865
There is no water,
where black rock is found

466
00:50:32,865 --> 00:50:34,583
Even if they do,
it will be saline water

467
00:50:35,583 --> 00:50:36,469
Mark my words!

468
00:50:39,469 --> 00:50:41,182
This bloody black rock
is a curse

469
00:50:44,182 --> 00:50:47,465
"Great land, great is the musician.
Great music, great are the words" (Folk song)

470
00:50:47,465 --> 00:50:55,467
"O Goddess! Your kind eyes and
sweet voice fill me with warmth" (Folk song)

471
00:50:55,467 --> 00:51:00,307
"O dear mother! I will pray
to you all my life" (Folk song)

472
00:51:00,307 --> 00:51:08,715
"My beloved is going to a distant place
my man wants to see the foreign land" (Folk song)

473
00:51:08,715 --> 00:51:14,487
"It saddens my heart to see him go"
(Folk song)

474
00:51:14,487 --> 00:51:21,117
"But I know, wherever he goes,
he will always be mine" (Folk song)

475
00:51:22,117 --> 00:51:24,494
Those foreigners,
along with our enemies..

476
00:51:24,494 --> 00:51:26,242
...are digging for water
on the other side

477
00:51:27,242 --> 00:51:28,184
They've got
huge machines

478
00:51:29,184 --> 00:51:32,117
Bastards...claim they
can dig water in a night

479
00:51:33,117 --> 00:51:35,028
Looks like they
will make ponds

480
00:51:38,028 --> 00:51:40,284
If those villagers get water
our pride will be compromised

481
00:51:41,284 --> 00:51:42,699
True

482
00:51:43,699 --> 00:51:45,608
Our influence
will be lost

483
00:51:47,608 --> 00:51:49,157
Rascals will get water
for their animals

484
00:51:50,157 --> 00:51:54,525
Even if they do, it will be saline.
Their land is brackish

485
00:51:55,525 --> 00:51:57,034
Will fill up sacks of salt...
Losers!

486
00:51:59,034 --> 00:52:00,963
Leave it...

487
00:52:01,963 --> 00:52:03,146
Let's go and piss in
our chief's ear

488
00:52:05,146 --> 00:52:06,547
Where is the old man?

489
00:52:06,547 --> 00:52:10,240
When the daughter is swinging her
hips in front of the entire village...

490
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:13,240
.. Embarrassed, he must be sleeping
after smoking pot

491
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:19,382
Let's go grab her...
She is too hot

492
00:52:22,382 --> 00:52:24,393
She's going to be my sister-in-law

493
00:52:25,393 --> 00:52:30,878
Sir, do you think these
machines are of any use?

494
00:52:30,878 --> 00:52:33,355
These machines are
worth a fortune

495
00:52:33,355 --> 00:52:35,715
If they can't, then who else
will tell where the water is?

496
00:52:35,715 --> 00:52:37,864
How stupid!

497
00:52:38,864 --> 00:52:41,739
Kisna sir, don't mind
if I say something

498
00:52:42,739 --> 00:52:43,288
Say...

499
00:52:44,288 --> 00:52:47,114
It needs faith
to find water

500
00:52:49,114 --> 00:52:53,673
What?
- Faith

501
00:52:54,673 --> 00:52:58,679
Since I am sitting with you
and eating your food

502
00:52:58,679 --> 00:53:00,561
I must listen to your
nonsense!

503
00:53:02,561 --> 00:53:04,163
Faith!
(Mocking)

504
00:53:05,163 --> 00:53:08,619
So, you want me to
get lost with my machine?

505
00:53:08,619 --> 00:53:10,822
You find water with your
faith...

506
00:53:11,822 --> 00:53:12,922
Bakka!

507
00:53:17,922 --> 00:53:21,248
Hey Bakka,
Madam is very thirsty

508
00:53:21,248 --> 00:53:23,777
She is our guest.
We must get her water

509
00:53:23,777 --> 00:53:25,159
Get her water!
From where?

510
00:53:28,159 --> 00:53:29,355
From the
enemy village...

511
00:53:36,355 --> 00:53:37,010
Let's go Butiya

512
00:53:44,010 --> 00:53:46,554
You have lost your mind
in her love

513
00:53:47,554 --> 00:53:51,135
You get the water.
I'll go & keep an eye in the village

514
00:53:52,135 --> 00:53:55,978
O Bakka, the men will be out
with their herd

515
00:53:55,978 --> 00:53:57,052
Who will you
keep an eye on?

516
00:53:58,052 --> 00:54:01,407
The women here are no less sharp.
I'll watch out for them

517
00:54:01,407 --> 00:54:05,552
Your old wound has
not healed yet... Be careful!

518
00:54:05,552 --> 00:54:08,661
That's why I am going.
I may find balm for my wound

519
00:54:15,661 --> 00:54:19,260
Ae Bakka,
there is a lot of water here..

520
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:21,364
Careful, Rakla

521
00:54:22,364 --> 00:54:24,253
Even the slightest ripple
can alert the enemy

522
00:55:22,253 --> 00:55:24,007
Aren't you ashamed of
watching a woman bathing?

523
00:55:25,007 --> 00:55:27,371
Saw you dancing
in the village fair

524
00:55:27,371 --> 00:55:28,480
...am still troubled

525
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:32,664
What will happen now
that I have seen you bathing?

526
00:55:33,664 --> 00:55:34,159
You've become so daring

527
00:55:35,159 --> 00:55:37,652
...that you have come to my
village in broad daylight!

528
00:55:37,652 --> 00:55:38,490
I am here to steal water

529
00:55:39,490 --> 00:55:41,213
Raise an alarm;
get me beaten up by your father

530
00:55:43,213 --> 00:55:45,400
Sit butiya...
sit

531
00:55:56,400 --> 00:56:02,476
Look, you will not
find a man like me...

532
00:56:03,476 --> 00:56:07,306
Handsome, courageous &
true to his word

533
00:56:09,306 --> 00:56:10,235
Today I am here for water

534
00:56:13,235 --> 00:56:14,548
Soon, I will come for you

535
00:56:19,548 --> 00:56:23,853
Can't trust the enemy village
and its men

536
00:56:29,853 --> 00:56:31,722
Puniya is here! Run

537
00:56:33,722 --> 00:56:34,425
Quick! Hide!

538
00:56:41,425 --> 00:56:47,699
Let us shower together...

539
00:56:48,699 --> 00:56:51,115
It has suddenly become
steaming hot...

540
00:56:59,115 --> 00:57:00,335
Is he gone?

541
00:57:01,335 --> 00:57:02,449
No

542
00:57:17,449 --> 00:57:20,541
You're beautiful...
so is your body

543
00:57:21,541 --> 00:57:23,197
One day, I will cover it
with gold

544
00:57:24,197 --> 00:57:25,610
Only gold...

545
00:57:26,610 --> 00:57:30,320
Just one condition...
You will wear nothing else

546
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:43,317
Hey, Rakla

547
00:57:44,317 --> 00:57:47,974
We don't need water
We've got it

548
00:57:48,974 --> 00:57:52,876
Bakka always says,
water is there...

549
00:57:52,876 --> 00:57:56,989
...but, very deep
inside the earth

550
00:57:56,989 --> 00:58:01,481
The rain water is soaked
by the desert in no time

551
00:58:03,481 --> 00:58:09,405
I've heard this machine
digs really deep

552
00:58:14,405 --> 00:58:16,612
What if...
we steal the machine?

553
00:58:19,612 --> 00:58:21,242
Have some shame...
you fathead!

554
00:58:23,242 --> 00:58:24,701
Will we find water?

555
00:59:23,701 --> 00:59:26,657
I told you, they will
not find water

556
00:59:26,657 --> 00:59:31,557
Good! Or I would have
dug up their graves right here

557
00:59:32,557 --> 00:59:34,867
Hey stop this noise!

558
00:59:34,867 --> 00:59:36,188
Sir, the machine
did not find water?

559
00:59:37,188 --> 00:59:41,632
How does it matter to you?
You people are getting money

560
00:59:41,632 --> 00:59:46,893
Machine mistook gas for water.
Don't get angry

561
00:59:46,893 --> 00:59:49,400
Our Bakka also goes
wrong sometimes

562
00:59:54,106 --> 00:59:56,242
Shut up, you ass!
Get Lost!

563
00:59:56,242 --> 01:00:00,856
He will get us screwed. Madam
will leave..

564
01:00:01,856 --> 01:00:03,664
..and we will get neither money
nor water

565
01:00:19,664 --> 01:00:20,827
Madam!

566
01:00:22,827 --> 01:00:23,737
Hey Stop...

567
01:00:23,737 --> 01:00:26,059
Where are you going?
Got no manners?

568
01:00:27,059 --> 01:00:28,554
Madam is inside. How
can you go in like this?

569
01:00:28,554 --> 01:00:29,235
Call her out

570
01:00:33,235 --> 01:00:34,980
Get lost. Go

571
01:00:35,980 --> 01:00:37,117
First ask him
to shut up

572
01:00:40,117 --> 01:00:42,579
Madam, Bakka knows
where to find water

573
01:00:42,579 --> 01:00:43,083
Come with me

574
01:00:45,083 --> 01:00:48,829
It's their way of fooling
people. You and your Bakka..

575
01:00:48,829 --> 01:00:50,054
Be quiet! What good are
your machines?

576
01:00:51,054 --> 01:00:53,411
You marked so many spots,
Did you find any water?

577
01:00:53,411 --> 01:00:55,576
When Bakka marks a spot,
you will definitely find water

578
01:01:54,576 --> 01:01:55,708
What do you think?

579
01:01:55,708 --> 01:01:59,559
Sir, sometimes the villagers
do find water this way

580
01:01:59,559 --> 01:02:00,876
What do you mean, they do?

581
01:02:00,876 --> 01:02:03,103
If they do, after all our hard work
it will screw our reputation

582
01:02:04,103 --> 01:02:05,230
No problem, sir

583
01:02:05,230 --> 01:02:07,516
What no problem? It seems you
love getting screwed

584
01:02:35,516 --> 01:02:36,769
Took two cans, brother

585
01:02:36,769 --> 01:02:39,612
Yeah, it's your father's
property! Bastard!

586
01:02:40,612 --> 01:02:42,144
Hey drama king!
What are you up to?

587
01:02:43,144 --> 01:02:47,304
You think your copper sticks
are better than the computer

588
01:02:48,304 --> 01:02:50,838
It's easy for you to say,
spot 1, spot 2...

589
01:02:50,838 --> 01:02:53,056
This constant digging
is killing us all...

590
01:02:54,056 --> 01:02:56,016
Richard sir... spot 3

591
01:02:57,016 --> 01:02:59,463
Where?
- Right where you're sitting!

592
01:03:02,463 --> 01:03:04,835
Ae Gani Bhai...
-What?

593
01:03:04,835 --> 01:03:09,434
Will we get water?
- How would I know, you ass?

594
01:03:40,434 --> 01:03:41,608
Ae! Diesel...

595
01:03:43,608 --> 01:03:45,445
(Clears throat)
Diesel!

596
01:04:02,445 --> 01:04:03,139
We'll be right back

597
01:04:05,139 --> 01:04:06,331
Bakka

598
01:04:11,331 --> 01:04:16,445
It feels bad to see my god
work as a labourer

599
01:04:20,445 --> 01:04:22,757
...offerings from the
Goddess's temple

600
01:04:23,757 --> 01:04:25,331
I've prayed for water

601
01:04:26,331 --> 01:04:27,099
May you always remain...

602
01:04:32,099 --> 01:04:33,961
...the god of water

603
01:04:35,961 --> 01:04:37,597
I may be god for others

604
01:04:39,597 --> 01:04:42,612
I am ready to be
your slave, if you say

605
01:04:42,612 --> 01:04:43,442
It's all talk

606
01:04:44,442 --> 01:04:46,373
You are a slave to that
foreigner woman nowadays

607
01:04:47,373 --> 01:04:49,070
Always stuck to her

608
01:04:50,070 --> 01:04:52,748
So, you keep a track of me...

609
01:04:55,748 --> 01:04:59,300
Hey stop this nonsense.
Nothing's going to happen

610
01:06:29,300 --> 01:06:34,061
(Crowd applauds)

611
01:06:38,061 --> 01:06:40,425
Now...Bakka will...

612
01:06:51,925 --> 01:06:56,777
Sorry... Mr. Bakka,
will say a few words

613
01:06:57,777 --> 01:06:58,992
Here you go...

614
01:06:59,992 --> 01:07:01,673
Say it, say it

615
01:07:10,673 --> 01:07:17,242
Makes me think, when I searched
water for humans I got abuses...

616
01:07:19,242 --> 01:07:22,923
And now when I find
water for birds...

617
01:07:24,923 --> 01:07:27,090
I get new clothes...

618
01:07:29,090 --> 01:07:29,512
A job

619
01:07:32,512 --> 01:07:33,844
Money...

620
01:07:35,844 --> 01:07:37,313
And respect

621
01:07:40,313 --> 01:07:41,965
Great!

622
01:07:43,965 --> 01:07:44,831
Right, Sukhiya?

623
01:07:44,831 --> 01:07:45,528
Now, find water for
the village too

624
01:07:46,528 --> 01:07:48,269
Okay... but I have
3 conditions

625
01:07:48,269 --> 01:07:49,735
What conditions?

626
01:07:50,735 --> 01:07:53,173
First condition,
party...

627
01:07:54,173 --> 01:07:56,588
...for me, and my friends

628
01:07:58,588 --> 01:07:59,672
I'll tell you the
second condition

629
01:08:00,672 --> 01:08:01,621
Bakka's own house!

630
01:08:05,621 --> 01:08:07,755
And third
- Yeah, tell us

631
01:08:10,755 --> 01:08:11,945
Third...

632
01:08:12,945 --> 01:08:15,088
I'll tell you
in the village.

633
01:08:17,088 --> 01:08:21,537
Bakka, tell them your
third condition now

634
01:08:22,537 --> 01:08:24,056
Tell them quick...

635
01:08:24,056 --> 01:08:24,525
Say it, Bakka.
C'mon...

636
01:08:25,525 --> 01:08:27,198
Speak up...

637
01:08:27,198 --> 01:08:30,097
Marriage with Kesar,
from the enemy village

638
01:08:31,097 --> 01:08:32,671
What is he saying?

639
01:08:32,671 --> 01:08:34,712
Sit, sit
- Calm down

640
01:08:35,712 --> 01:08:37,463
Sit!

641
01:08:40,463 --> 01:08:43,578
Your urge for Kesar,
will get us all fucked...

642
01:08:46,578 --> 01:08:48,322
Kesar!

643
01:08:57,322 --> 01:09:04,849
Ae Puniya.. that bastard's
third condition is to marry Kesar

644
01:09:08,849 --> 01:09:12,162
Listen everybody...

645
01:09:12,162 --> 01:09:15,139
Bakka & Puniya are fighting
in the desert. Let's go..

646
01:09:15,139 --> 01:09:19,313
Let's kick their ass!

647
01:09:28,313 --> 01:09:29,086
Come on

648
01:09:31,086 --> 01:09:31,587
Come on

649
01:09:33,587 --> 01:09:35,417
Come on. You swine

650
01:10:30,417 --> 01:10:32,042
Puniya, pin him down

651
01:10:40,042 --> 01:10:44,672
Bastard...
I'll teach you a good lesson

652
01:10:46,672 --> 01:10:47,956
Bakka...

653
01:11:21,956 --> 01:11:23,791
Ram Khiladi...
Stop them...

654
01:11:29,791 --> 01:11:31,997
What.. what happened?

655
01:11:31,997 --> 01:11:35,238
We're preparing for
Bakka and Kesar's marriage

656
01:11:35,238 --> 01:11:36,170
Marriage?

657
01:11:36,170 --> 01:11:39,020
Yes it's a tradition

658
01:11:39,020 --> 01:11:43,298
Madam this is how we
fix marriages in our village

659
01:11:59,298 --> 01:12:01,798
Come out...fast, there's
good news for you

660
01:12:03,798 --> 01:12:10,951
This is a confirmation letter...
Your government job is fixed

661
01:12:27,951 --> 01:12:29,243
Hold it properly

662
01:12:33,243 --> 01:12:35,645
She is also motherless
like me

663
01:12:36,645 --> 01:12:39,911
Once we get married,
I'll keep her very happy

664
01:12:43,911 --> 01:12:45,619
Give it back
I will not apply

665
01:12:46,619 --> 01:12:47,909
Kajri
- Leave my hand

666
01:12:48,909 --> 01:12:50,314
Come here

667
01:12:51,314 --> 01:12:54,298
Are you really
in love with me?

668
01:12:55,298 --> 01:12:56,243
Why?

669
01:12:57,243 --> 01:13:00,207
Are you the only
man in this village?

670
01:13:21,207 --> 01:13:24,368
You also have a
beautiful body

671
01:13:30,368 --> 01:13:35,492
But Kesar's beauty
is unmatched

672
01:13:47,492 --> 01:13:50,615
Look chief, we are
always there with you

673
01:13:51,615 --> 01:13:53,742
But think before
saying yes...

674
01:13:55,742 --> 01:13:57,408
Look, Rana

675
01:13:58,408 --> 01:14:02,295
Someday, Bakka will be
useful for us too

676
01:14:02,295 --> 01:14:04,993
Our wells will also
dry up someday

677
01:14:06,993 --> 01:14:09,323
I've thought
about it

678
01:14:12,323 --> 01:14:14,490
I am ready for
their marriage

679
01:14:16,490 --> 01:14:20,489
Good decision...
a sensible one

680
01:14:26,489 --> 01:14:47,323
(Folk Song - Part
of the wedding ritual)

681
01:15:07,323 --> 01:15:09,274
Hey Vela Bhai!
- Yes

682
01:15:10,274 --> 01:15:13,353
Did the door open?
- Not yet

683
01:15:13,353 --> 01:15:14,890
Keep a watch
- Yes, I will

684
01:15:14,890 --> 01:15:16,279
Let me know

685
01:15:20,279 --> 01:15:22,404
Bakka didn't
come to work ?

686
01:15:31,404 --> 01:15:33,688
Lajo. What are you staring at?

687
01:15:34,688 --> 01:15:37,037
They aren't going to
open the door today

688
01:15:43,037 --> 01:15:45,310
Bakka will open
the door today

689
01:15:45,310 --> 01:15:51,645
Bakka will open
the door today

690
01:15:51,645 --> 01:15:52,702
Move aside. Move

691
01:15:53,702 --> 01:15:55,094
Bakka will open
the door today

692
01:16:02,094 --> 01:16:03,652
He said he'll
come out today

693
01:16:06,652 --> 01:16:08,635
It opened...

694
01:16:21,635 --> 01:16:23,091
Hello

695
01:16:24,091 --> 01:16:26,114
Hello
- Hello

696
01:16:27,114 --> 01:16:27,661
What happened?

697
01:16:32,661 --> 01:16:35,170
Bakka...
My friend

698
01:16:37,170 --> 01:16:38,787
Is she okay...
my sis-in-law?

699
01:16:39,787 --> 01:16:40,693
Ae Kesar...

700
01:16:43,693 --> 01:16:44,623
Sister-in-law!

701
01:16:50,623 --> 01:16:54,484
Kesar, how are you doing?

702
01:16:54,484 --> 01:16:57,555
Did you not need food
or water for ten days?

703
01:16:58,555 --> 01:17:01,936
That's the
men of our village

704
01:17:04,936 --> 01:17:09,814
I didn't open
my doors for 16 days

705
01:18:09,814 --> 01:18:11,939
Bakka, you have done
amazing work

706
01:18:11,939 --> 01:18:13,730
Got wells dug up
in the desert...

707
01:18:14,730 --> 01:18:17,030
...ponds built for the birds

708
01:18:17,030 --> 01:18:18,573
You are finding water
easily now

709
01:18:19,573 --> 01:18:21,246
What did I say...

710
01:18:23,246 --> 01:18:28,411
When my heart is happy,
I won't let any heart break

711
01:18:30,411 --> 01:18:34,283
You are now, a man with
a big heart and a big house too

712
01:18:34,283 --> 01:18:37,095
You don't come to my house
anymore

713
01:18:38,095 --> 01:18:42,435
Bakka, everyone was saying...
the chief also...

714
01:18:43,435 --> 01:18:47,344
You should talk to white madam
about the machine...

715
01:18:48,344 --> 01:18:51,011
Once that machine
comes to our village

716
01:18:52,011 --> 01:18:53,582
We will also get a well

717
01:18:56,582 --> 01:19:00,862
Hmm...Kesar also has to go very
far to get water

718
01:19:01,862 --> 01:19:02,890
I feel bad

719
01:19:03,890 --> 01:19:05,547
She never had to
in her father's house

720
01:19:06,547 --> 01:19:08,869
There was a well
in her village

721
01:19:11,869 --> 01:19:12,644
I must talk
to madam

722
01:19:17,644 --> 01:19:19,478
See, madam...

723
01:19:19,478 --> 01:19:23,224
Snow
- It's not snow, it's salt...

724
01:19:23,224 --> 01:19:26,353
Salt... Like snow

725
01:19:33,353 --> 01:19:33,644
Bakka...

726
01:19:36,644 --> 01:19:38,226
You are a good man

727
01:19:52,226 --> 01:19:55,332
Sit...sit...

728
01:20:04,332 --> 01:20:06,850
Madam, the birds have
got water

729
01:20:07,850 --> 01:20:09,957
So, the villagers
were saying...

730
01:20:09,957 --> 01:20:13,273
...if we can get the
machine for two days...

731
01:20:33,273 --> 01:20:34,000
Bakka...

732
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:35,864
Ae Bakka

733
01:20:36,864 --> 01:20:39,215
Did you talk
about the machine?

734
01:20:43,215 --> 01:20:45,148
Madam looked worried

735
01:20:46,148 --> 01:20:49,395
So I thought I'll talk to
Richard sir later

736
01:21:24,395 --> 01:21:26,722
Bakka Bhai
God of water

737
01:21:27,722 --> 01:21:29,305
So, you're here

738
01:21:30,305 --> 01:21:35,270
Sir has awarded
you tip. Keep it

739
01:21:37,270 --> 01:21:38,511
You keep it
- I see

740
01:21:40,511 --> 01:21:43,872
Talk to Richard sir & take
this machine to our village

741
01:21:44,872 --> 01:21:45,667
That's it

742
01:21:46,667 --> 01:21:49,600
Bakka, you've got quite an
attitude after you found water

743
01:21:50,600 --> 01:21:52,787
It needs diesel worth
thousands of rupees, you idiot!

744
01:21:53,787 --> 01:21:55,769
It came here to dig up
water for the birds

745
01:21:55,769 --> 01:21:58,309
The birds got water & flew off.
Now, you also take off....

746
01:21:58,309 --> 01:21:58,762
So what!
We'll pay you

747
01:22:00,762 --> 01:22:01,877
The villagers will pay you

748
01:22:04,877 --> 01:22:07,310
Sir, water is invaluable

749
01:22:08,310 --> 01:22:09,837
The villagers are
ready to pay

750
01:22:10,837 --> 01:22:12,738
Just get this
machine to our village

751
01:22:28,738 --> 01:22:31,644
Sir, we want the machine
in our village

752
01:22:47,644 --> 01:22:53,032
Look. He will write,
put in a recommendation...

753
01:22:53,032 --> 01:22:55,350
...to his superiors. Right?

754
01:22:56,350 --> 01:23:00,203
Sir if you try, something
will definitely work out

755
01:23:00,203 --> 01:23:01,597
We'll have water
in our village

756
01:23:03,597 --> 01:23:04,618
Namaste...

757
01:23:08,618 --> 01:23:10,945
Take the bonus,
and your wages

758
01:23:11,945 --> 01:23:12,815
And leave, okay?

759
01:23:13,815 --> 01:23:14,600
He'll try. Go

760
01:23:16,600 --> 01:23:17,600
Money we got & the
machine will come...

761
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:23,059
Yeah...the machine
will come Rakla

762
01:23:25,059 --> 01:23:25,737
We will get water

763
01:23:29,737 --> 01:23:34,016
Richard sir has promised, he
will write to his superiors

764
01:23:36,016 --> 01:23:38,770
The machine will
come for sure

765
01:23:39,770 --> 01:23:41,502
Richard sir has promised

766
01:23:42,502 --> 01:23:44,390
Huh! Promise!!

767
01:23:45,390 --> 01:23:50,181
If he says he will write,
he will never write

768
01:23:50,181 --> 01:23:54,057
And even if he does,
we'll never get a reply

769
01:23:55,057 --> 01:23:56,206
Ok Kheema Bhai...

770
01:23:59,206 --> 01:24:00,556
I have an idea...

771
01:24:01,556 --> 01:24:03,863
Let's go and steal
the machine at night

772
01:24:03,863 --> 01:24:04,805
We'll deal with
whatever happens later

773
01:24:05,805 --> 01:24:08,819
No, Rakla.
I can't steal

774
01:24:10,819 --> 01:24:12,514
I would rather wait
for the reply

775
01:24:14,514 --> 01:24:16,056
The machine will come

776
01:24:17,056 --> 01:24:20,127
But we'll have to pay
for the diesel, chief

777
01:24:25,127 --> 01:24:27,264
Pay for the diesel!

778
01:24:27,264 --> 01:24:29,639
But how, Chief? We'll need
thousands of rupees for that

779
01:24:31,639 --> 01:24:33,930
From where will we get
that kind of money?

780
01:24:33,930 --> 01:24:36,300
We barely can afford a
square meal

781
01:24:49,300 --> 01:24:52,255
What use is all this
jewelry on our body...

782
01:24:54,255 --> 01:24:57,220
...when we are
dying of thirst

783
01:25:05,220 --> 01:25:09,761
More than jewelry, women need
a well in the village

784
01:25:28,761 --> 01:25:35,845
Go and get all the
gold, silver that you have

785
01:26:09,845 --> 01:26:11,801
Didn't I tell you Kesar...

786
01:26:12,801 --> 01:26:17,479
One day I'll cover you
with gold...

787
01:26:18,479 --> 01:26:20,778
See I got it

788
01:26:28,778 --> 01:26:38,929
"Eyes more beautiful than a
million twinkling stars"

789
01:26:39,929 --> 01:26:50,551
"The moon gazes at your
flawless beauty"

790
01:26:51,551 --> 01:27:01,798
"The night feels blessed
by your presence"

791
01:27:02,798 --> 01:27:12,091
"Your radiance makes the
desert sand sparkle in the dark"

792
01:27:13,091 --> 01:27:15,256
Sir, we want this

793
01:27:16,256 --> 01:27:18,965
It's not your village scooter,
belongs to the water department

794
01:27:19,965 --> 01:27:21,590
Sir, there's no water
in our village

795
01:27:22,590 --> 01:27:25,672
So ask your Richard sir to send
a machine from London

796
01:27:25,672 --> 01:27:28,422
This belongs to the Govt. of India
and it's under my care

797
01:27:28,422 --> 01:27:29,845
We will take
it anyways

798
01:27:29,845 --> 01:27:32,796
Will you?
I will give you a tight one...

799
01:27:34,796 --> 01:27:36,243
Ae Bakka,
open the door

800
01:27:40,243 --> 01:27:43,006
Open the door or
I'll break it down

801
01:27:47,006 --> 01:27:48,654
What is this ruckus for?

802
01:27:48,654 --> 01:27:50,838
Bakka is dressed up
like a rockstar

803
01:27:51,838 --> 01:27:53,421
You don't need to go to
work anymore

804
01:27:53,421 --> 01:27:56,047
Sir has refused to
give the machine

805
01:27:56,047 --> 01:27:58,130
How can he refuse?

806
01:27:58,130 --> 01:28:00,590
The machine will come.
It's my word

807
01:28:17,590 --> 01:28:20,462
Ae Bakka,
What are you doing?

808
01:28:20,462 --> 01:28:20,806
Tell me...

809
01:28:23,806 --> 01:28:26,015
...what's going on
in your mind?

810
01:28:28,015 --> 01:28:31,462
Can't you see?
I am burying the jewelry

811
01:28:32,462 --> 01:28:37,170
Has all this gold made
you greedy?

812
01:28:37,170 --> 01:28:39,170
Are you planning to steal it?

813
01:28:41,170 --> 01:28:43,878
Look, there is still no
reply to Richard sir's letter

814
01:28:44,878 --> 01:28:46,649
What if we give them
all the jewelry...

815
01:28:46,649 --> 01:28:47,533
And then they
change their mind

816
01:28:48,533 --> 01:28:50,012
What if they cheat us?

817
01:28:52,012 --> 01:28:53,126
Oh God!

818
01:28:53,126 --> 01:28:55,600
Good thinking...
Here's the mark

819
01:28:56,600 --> 01:28:58,489
I got it!

820
01:28:58,489 --> 01:29:00,122
Go get my shawl & jacket
- Okay

821
01:29:01,122 --> 01:29:02,716
Look, we're going
out for a few days

822
01:29:03,716 --> 01:29:05,619
So who will be ruling here?
- Ram Khiladi

823
01:29:06,619 --> 01:29:10,389
So, who's responsible for all the
property & the machine - Me

824
01:29:10,389 --> 01:29:13,277
Go and call sir, go

825
01:29:13,277 --> 01:29:13,961
Hello, sir

826
01:29:16,961 --> 01:29:20,118
Sir, we need to talk to you

827
01:29:22,118 --> 01:29:22,835
Bakka...

828
01:29:24,835 --> 01:29:27,460
Sir didn't even
look at you

829
01:29:38,460 --> 01:29:41,215
These silly villagers...

830
01:29:41,215 --> 01:29:50,027
They'll all die in the desert
searching for water

831
01:29:54,027 --> 01:29:56,500
You are dressed
up like a stud!

832
01:29:57,500 --> 01:29:59,083
Rascals, you pests...

833
01:30:00,083 --> 01:30:04,207
You think I will dress
up like you all my life

834
01:30:05,207 --> 01:30:08,313
What do you want?
There's no one here

835
01:30:09,313 --> 01:30:12,416
I am the king
They've gone out for 2 days

836
01:30:12,416 --> 01:30:15,291
Tell me. What do you
want?

837
01:30:16,291 --> 01:30:18,416
Did Richard sir get a
reply to the letter?

838
01:30:20,416 --> 01:30:23,248
Forget the letter.
No letter is coming Bakka

839
01:30:23,248 --> 01:30:25,916
He fooled you.
That's how these foreigners are

840
01:30:25,916 --> 01:30:29,171
They come here, get
their work done and leave

841
01:30:29,171 --> 01:30:29,914
He's right...

842
01:30:31,914 --> 01:30:33,606
I don't think we will get
the machine

843
01:30:35,606 --> 01:30:39,676
Everybody will make fun of us.
What do we do?

844
01:30:40,676 --> 01:30:41,748
You were right...

845
01:30:42,748 --> 01:30:45,289
So what, if they
don't give the machine...

846
01:30:46,289 --> 01:30:48,498
...We'll take it!

847
01:30:49,498 --> 01:30:51,247
What do you mean?

848
01:30:54,247 --> 01:30:56,399
I mean, we'll steal it Rakla

849
01:31:03,399 --> 01:31:06,970
What are you up to?

850
01:31:09,970 --> 01:31:11,372
What are you doing?

851
01:31:12,372 --> 01:31:14,997
Can't you see?
I am stealing diesel

852
01:31:16,997 --> 01:31:19,082
This machine is
useless now

853
01:31:22,082 --> 01:31:24,162
Ram Khiladi...listen

854
01:31:27,162 --> 01:31:28,872
If I fill you up with gold...

855
01:31:30,872 --> 01:31:33,329
...Will you take this
machine to our village?

856
01:31:34,329 --> 01:31:36,355
What did you say?

857
01:31:36,355 --> 01:31:39,971
Gold! Jewelry...
of the entire village

858
01:31:40,971 --> 01:31:44,590
Fools...Your pants don't
stay on your waist

859
01:31:45,590 --> 01:31:47,912
You've got nothing to eat &
you will fill me up with gold

860
01:31:49,912 --> 01:31:52,693
You'll get all the
jewelry you want

861
01:31:53,693 --> 01:31:56,298
Trust us!

862
01:32:08,298 --> 01:32:10,994
Wow! All this is mine

863
01:32:13,994 --> 01:32:14,994
Half of it...

864
01:32:15,994 --> 01:32:18,771
The machine should reach our village
- It will reach...

865
01:32:19,771 --> 01:32:21,612
..It will..I promise

866
01:32:22,612 --> 01:32:23,578
Rakla, put them back

867
01:32:28,578 --> 01:32:30,827
The machine's here...

868
01:32:30,827 --> 01:32:34,716
"Come to me,
my heartless lover”

869
01:32:35,716 --> 01:32:41,868
"Hear the desperate cries..."

870
01:32:41,868 --> 01:32:48,746
"...of my parched soul"

871
01:32:54,746 --> 01:32:57,338
What's the matter?
You look very happy

872
01:32:58,338 --> 01:33:01,618
I have been happy ever since
you came in my life, Kesar

873
01:33:03,618 --> 01:33:06,810
Fame, fortune, respect
government job

874
01:33:07,810 --> 01:33:09,059
All because of you

875
01:33:10,059 --> 01:33:11,783
You've changed
my destiny

876
01:33:12,783 --> 01:33:14,789
And now, the machine
has also arrived

877
01:33:14,789 --> 01:33:16,560
Go, look! Everyone's
dancing with joy

878
01:33:19,560 --> 01:33:22,189
Now we'll get water and
villagers' fortunes will change

879
01:33:23,189 --> 01:33:25,422
Really Kesar!
You have done wonders

880
01:33:25,422 --> 01:33:29,409
Great! Let's celebrate
with sweets

881
01:33:35,409 --> 01:33:38,985
I don't want sweets.
I want you

882
01:33:39,985 --> 01:33:43,596
Ae Bakka, come quickly
The machine got damaged

883
01:33:44,596 --> 01:33:45,836
There was a
big rock in the ground

884
01:33:46,836 --> 01:33:48,033
Hurry up...

885
01:33:48,033 --> 01:33:49,189
I'll just be back

886
01:33:52,189 --> 01:33:56,180
Bakka, your machine stopped
working. - Yeah! It gave up

887
01:33:56,180 --> 01:33:57,823
Back off, you idiots...

888
01:33:59,823 --> 01:34:05,657
What should we do now?
Let's return the jewelry

889
01:34:06,657 --> 01:34:09,353
We've got into
a big problem

890
01:34:10,353 --> 01:34:12,393
Ae Ram Khiladi, how did
the machine break down?

891
01:34:12,393 --> 01:34:13,953
You said it will
dig water

892
01:34:13,953 --> 01:34:16,234
It's all your fault & you
are asking me...

893
01:34:53,234 --> 01:34:54,875
I am only a
jeep driver

894
01:34:54,875 --> 01:34:56,603
You got me in to
this mess

895
01:34:58,603 --> 01:35:02,180
I am doomed. It's such an
expensive machine

896
01:35:02,180 --> 01:35:05,864
Sir will find out. The police
will arrest me, not you

897
01:35:06,864 --> 01:35:08,654
It's worth millions,
don't you know?

898
01:35:10,654 --> 01:35:13,625
I'll teach the scoundrels a lesson
they will never forget

899
01:35:15,625 --> 01:35:17,002
Hello...

900
01:35:17,002 --> 01:35:18,613
Yes Inspector,
Krishna Prasad speaking

901
01:35:19,613 --> 01:35:22,158
Someone stole the
department's machine

902
01:35:22,158 --> 01:35:24,444
So you stole
the machine

903
01:35:24,444 --> 01:35:25,819
Look at him

904
01:35:26,819 --> 01:35:27,819
We didn't
have an option..

905
01:35:28,819 --> 01:35:30,813
Anyways, we would have
returned it in 2 days

906
01:35:31,813 --> 01:35:37,587
Right now... just somehow
fix this machine and dump it back

907
01:35:38,587 --> 01:35:42,300
Else, all of us
will be screwed

908
01:35:42,300 --> 01:35:44,194
But...
what about water, Bakka?

909
01:35:44,194 --> 01:35:46,373
You took all our gold
-Oh drop that

910
01:35:46,373 --> 01:35:47,572
Here we all are going
to be crucified...

911
01:35:48,572 --> 01:35:49,595
And you're worried about
gold

912
01:35:51,595 --> 01:35:53,893
Bakka...just take
this trouble away

913
01:35:53,893 --> 01:35:54,918
Yeah... right!

914
01:35:54,918 --> 01:35:57,322
Now it has become
a trouble for you

915
01:35:57,322 --> 01:36:00,817
Till yesterday you
were dying to get it

916
01:36:00,817 --> 01:36:03,048
Now that it's broken,
it's a trouble for you

917
01:36:03,048 --> 01:36:05,471
Not after two days,
I am taking it back right now

918
01:36:05,471 --> 01:36:06,612
Come along if anybody
wants to

919
01:36:07,612 --> 01:36:12,988
Rakla you go & take out the jewelry.
I'll go with Ram Khiladi

920
01:36:12,988 --> 01:36:13,582
Let's go Parnami

921
01:36:17,582 --> 01:36:19,585
Chief, we had good
intentions

922
01:36:34,585 --> 01:36:38,418
Look! Machine...
Don't spare them

923
01:36:38,418 --> 01:36:42,252
Don't worry,
I'll take care of this

924
01:36:42,252 --> 01:36:44,627
What's the police
doing here?

925
01:36:44,627 --> 01:36:47,835
You stay quiet. Let me talk

926
01:36:49,835 --> 01:36:50,793
Hello, Inspector

927
01:36:51,793 --> 01:36:53,838
I came to see the machine
but it was missing

928
01:36:53,838 --> 01:36:57,542
So, I took them along and went
looking & found it parked there

929
01:36:58,542 --> 01:37:01,377
And who are these two?
- These are village people

930
01:37:01,377 --> 01:37:03,814
Bakka & Parnami...
very helpful

931
01:37:03,814 --> 01:37:06,335
They helped me find
the machine

932
01:37:09,335 --> 01:37:10,953
The machine's broken!

933
01:37:10,953 --> 01:37:12,551
Where are you going?

934
01:37:12,551 --> 01:37:13,751
Catch them

935
01:37:16,751 --> 01:37:17,667
Don't let them get away

936
01:37:19,667 --> 01:37:23,750
Bloody rascals have the cheek
to steal the govt. machine & break it

937
01:37:24,750 --> 01:37:29,471
Give them a good bashing
- They are dangerous people

938
01:37:29,471 --> 01:37:31,783
Really?
- Yeah! Bury people alive

939
01:37:45,783 --> 01:37:47,547
See...he is guilty

940
01:37:48,547 --> 01:37:51,375
But I am not guilty.
I am a respected man...

941
01:37:51,375 --> 01:37:52,707
Shut up!

942
01:37:53,707 --> 01:37:58,389
Ram Khiladi and him,
they planned this together

943
01:37:58,389 --> 01:37:59,998
Government employee, huh

944
01:37:59,998 --> 01:38:01,707
You think you are
bigger than the government!

945
01:38:02,707 --> 01:38:06,832
Are you my boss, that you will take
the machine without permission?

946
01:38:06,832 --> 01:38:09,457
Lock them up for two
days & kick their ass

947
01:38:09,457 --> 01:38:11,228
They will talk
like parrots

948
01:38:11,228 --> 01:38:14,184
And your job's temporary.
You're on contract

949
01:38:14,184 --> 01:38:16,354
It can be taken away
the way it was given to you

950
01:38:16,354 --> 01:38:18,373
You can keep
your job

951
01:38:18,373 --> 01:38:20,207
You used us to get water for
birds & when we used the machine

952
01:38:20,207 --> 01:38:22,831
..to find water for our village,
you call us thieves

953
01:38:23,831 --> 01:38:24,716
I, Bakka found
water for you

954
01:38:26,716 --> 01:38:29,399
What happened
to your letter?

955
01:38:31,399 --> 01:38:33,453
So, you'll steal it?

956
01:38:33,453 --> 01:38:35,372
I didn't steal it

957
01:38:35,372 --> 01:38:36,773
I made a mistake,
so I am resigning from the job

958
01:38:37,773 --> 01:38:38,902
We're leaving now

959
01:38:39,902 --> 01:38:41,119
Let's go, Parnami

960
01:38:43,119 --> 01:38:45,247
So, I'll also leave?

961
01:38:45,247 --> 01:38:48,081
Leave it sir, they are
dangerous people

962
01:38:50,081 --> 01:38:51,416
Rakla...

963
01:39:06,416 --> 01:39:07,750
The stone was here..

964
01:39:15,750 --> 01:39:16,859
Where are the jewels?

965
01:39:39,859 --> 01:39:40,993
Ae Rakla!

966
01:39:49,993 --> 01:39:50,703
Rakla!

967
01:40:23,703 --> 01:40:25,091
You drama king!

968
01:40:26,091 --> 01:40:27,936
Passed out after
smoking pot?

969
01:40:30,936 --> 01:40:31,533
Hey Rakla, get up...

970
01:40:40,533 --> 01:40:42,158
Rakla!

971
01:40:43,158 --> 01:40:44,408
Rakla!

972
01:40:51,408 --> 01:40:51,908
Rakla!

973
01:41:18,908 --> 01:41:19,615
Bakka..

974
01:41:21,615 --> 01:41:23,407
You're not serious..
Right?

975
01:41:25,407 --> 01:41:27,282
Villagers did
not get water

976
01:41:29,282 --> 01:41:30,614
The jewelry is missing...

977
01:41:32,614 --> 01:41:34,989
... and Rakla's dead

978
01:41:34,989 --> 01:41:36,989
I just buried his
dead body

979
01:41:42,989 --> 01:41:44,863
How will I face
his wife, Lajo?

980
01:41:51,863 --> 01:41:53,529
I will tell
everybody the truth

981
01:41:55,529 --> 01:41:58,079
Come, let's go to the chief
- No Bakka

982
01:41:59,079 --> 01:42:00,430
Use your head

983
01:42:02,430 --> 01:42:04,405
Don't tell anyone,
anything

984
01:42:05,405 --> 01:42:09,139
Everyone will think you
killed Rakla out of greed

985
01:42:10,139 --> 01:42:13,322
Tell everyone,
the machine will come

986
01:42:15,322 --> 01:42:17,333
Time will set everything
right

987
01:42:17,333 --> 01:42:20,570
I...I will talk to my father.
He will take care of everything

988
01:42:23,570 --> 01:42:24,779
Bakka! You won't tell
anyone anything

989
01:42:25,779 --> 01:42:26,619
Bakka...

990
01:42:34,619 --> 01:42:35,775
Where are the jewels?

991
01:42:38,775 --> 01:42:39,694
Who did this?

992
01:42:46,694 --> 01:42:47,599
This is how I killed him

993
01:42:50,599 --> 01:42:53,461
One hit and he was dead...
bastard!

994
01:42:56,461 --> 01:42:57,737
You are not a
bad man Puniya

995
01:42:58,737 --> 01:43:05,279
This desert heat gets to everyone.
Makes the blood boil

996
01:43:08,279 --> 01:43:10,694
Listen, Puniya...

997
01:43:11,694 --> 01:43:14,827
Don't hit me
from the back

998
01:43:15,827 --> 01:43:21,658
I won't die with one blow.
Then I'll have to take you along

999
01:43:22,658 --> 01:43:28,725
So, just let me take
my share & leave

1000
01:43:29,725 --> 01:43:33,344
Oh! I am scared!
Take your share...

1001
01:43:37,344 --> 01:43:38,784
Good...
Goodbye

1002
01:43:42,784 --> 01:43:45,631
Here begins...
the story of Bakka's destruction

1003
01:43:46,631 --> 01:43:48,025
I am Bakka!

1004
01:43:49,025 --> 01:43:50,826
The God of water!

1005
01:43:51,826 --> 01:43:52,817
I am Bakka!

1006
01:43:55,817 --> 01:43:57,761
The God of water!

1007
01:43:57,761 --> 01:43:59,201
I am Bakka!

1008
01:44:00,201 --> 01:44:02,418
The God of water!

1009
01:44:02,418 --> 01:44:05,340
Long live Bakka!

1010
01:44:23,340 --> 01:44:23,606
Come out...

1011
01:44:37,606 --> 01:44:39,104
Rakla's missing

1012
01:44:41,104 --> 01:44:42,408
He is not home yet

1013
01:44:45,408 --> 01:44:46,689
Where could he be?

1014
01:44:51,689 --> 01:44:53,481
You were with him,
weren't you?

1015
01:44:58,481 --> 01:44:59,899
The machine
broke down, so...

1016
01:45:00,899 --> 01:45:03,521
He must have gone to the
city with sir, to get it fixed

1017
01:45:05,521 --> 01:45:06,939
He doesn't bother
about us...

1018
01:45:09,939 --> 01:45:10,813
No one cares anymore

1019
01:45:25,813 --> 01:45:27,479
Chief...

1020
01:45:27,479 --> 01:45:30,563
It's been 15 days.
Forget about the machine

1021
01:45:31,563 --> 01:45:33,604
Let's start digging
on our own

1022
01:45:40,604 --> 01:45:43,119
Hello, Lajo

1023
01:45:43,119 --> 01:45:45,563
Looks like Rakla's fled
with the foreigner woman

1024
01:45:46,563 --> 01:45:51,863
I will drag him back even if
he goes to heaven

1025
01:46:00,863 --> 01:46:02,144
Work's going on in
full swing

1026
01:46:52,144 --> 01:46:54,310
Where have you all been?

1027
01:46:54,310 --> 01:46:56,226
Everyone needs water...

1028
01:46:56,226 --> 01:46:58,435
I am the only one digging
since morning

1029
01:46:58,435 --> 01:46:59,893
Come on,
give me a hand

1030
01:47:06,893 --> 01:47:08,559
Ae Manga...you bastard!
- You are the bastard!

1031
01:47:09,559 --> 01:47:13,060
Chief, let's bury him right here.
Don't let him get out

1032
01:47:13,060 --> 01:47:15,018
You scoundrel,
you'll bury me

1033
01:47:22,018 --> 01:47:23,475
Stop!

1034
01:47:25,475 --> 01:47:27,934
Bakka. What is this?

1035
01:47:32,934 --> 01:47:36,221
What greed made you
kill your friend?

1036
01:47:37,221 --> 01:47:39,114
Buried his dead body
in the desert..

1037
01:47:40,114 --> 01:47:41,493
Speak up Bakka

1038
01:47:41,493 --> 01:47:43,109
Chief...
- Tell me!

1039
01:47:44,109 --> 01:47:45,875
We have nothing to do
with you any more

1040
01:47:46,875 --> 01:47:47,583
You lied to
us every time

1041
01:47:48,583 --> 01:47:49,515
Chief, I...
- Keep quiet

1042
01:47:51,515 --> 01:47:54,099
We know that
you've been fired

1043
01:47:55,099 --> 01:47:56,521
No machine is
coming to the village

1044
01:47:57,521 --> 01:47:58,849
And where is the jewelry?

1045
01:48:00,849 --> 01:48:04,140
Where's our jewelry?
The villagers' jewelry...

1046
01:48:04,140 --> 01:48:05,431
Tell us..

1047
01:48:11,431 --> 01:48:12,932
Somebody stole it

1048
01:48:14,932 --> 01:48:17,512
Tell us, why did
you kill Rakla?

1049
01:48:20,512 --> 01:48:22,667
I didn't kill him

1050
01:48:23,667 --> 01:48:28,306
He is lying... cooking up
yet another story

1051
01:48:28,306 --> 01:48:29,367
No, it's true

1052
01:48:30,367 --> 01:48:31,564
The jewelry is
really stolen

1053
01:48:32,564 --> 01:48:36,381
I got scared when I saw his
dead body in the desert

1054
01:49:12,381 --> 01:49:15,012
Believe me.
I am not lying

1055
01:49:15,012 --> 01:49:16,762
I brought the machine...
didn't I?

1056
01:49:16,762 --> 01:49:18,911
I did everything for the
benefit of the village

1057
01:49:18,911 --> 01:49:21,762
For whose benefit
did you kill Rakla?

1058
01:49:21,762 --> 01:49:24,650
Kajri I did not...
- Don't! Just shut up...

1059
01:49:27,650 --> 01:49:29,498
Aren't you ashamed?

1060
01:49:31,498 --> 01:49:37,256
He let you live in his house, raised
you. You didn't even spare him?

1061
01:49:37,256 --> 01:49:39,136
Kajri I did not...
- No...Quiet!

1062
01:49:41,136 --> 01:49:42,796
I came to you that
night asking about him

1063
01:49:43,796 --> 01:49:44,511
Tell me...
why don't you say?

1064
01:49:45,511 --> 01:49:47,220
You knew...

1065
01:49:49,220 --> 01:49:52,403
...you knew that Rakla was
dead. Didn't you?

1066
01:49:57,403 --> 01:49:59,759
Every day you saw his wife getting
dressed like a married woman...

1067
01:49:59,759 --> 01:50:01,055
Didn't you feel guilty?

1068
01:50:04,055 --> 01:50:04,542
Come..

1069
01:50:05,542 --> 01:50:08,488
Wipe off the vermillion
from her forehead

1070
01:50:09,488 --> 01:50:10,136
Do it..

1071
01:50:13,136 --> 01:50:17,467
Chief, take a decision
right now..

1072
01:50:17,467 --> 01:50:19,885
This thief can't live
in this village!

1073
01:50:19,885 --> 01:50:21,622
Killed my friend Rakla!

1074
01:50:22,622 --> 01:50:25,882
His wife is a witch from
the enemy village...

1075
01:50:25,882 --> 01:50:29,445
She is a bad omen..

1076
01:50:29,445 --> 01:50:34,344
...has ruined our village

1077
01:50:34,344 --> 01:50:36,818
Let's throw them out of the village
- Yes

1078
01:50:36,818 --> 01:50:38,796
Yes, banish them chief!

1079
01:50:39,796 --> 01:50:45,425
Bakka, take your wife
& leave this village

1080
01:50:46,425 --> 01:50:47,716
You don't belong
here anymore

1081
01:50:48,716 --> 01:50:50,875
Maybe you didn't kill Rakla..

1082
01:50:50,875 --> 01:50:53,426
...but you are responsible
for his death

1083
01:50:53,426 --> 01:50:54,966
Why don't you all
believe me?

1084
01:50:56,966 --> 01:50:59,384
We'll get sweet
water from this well

1085
01:50:59,384 --> 01:51:01,154
I'll dig water for you

1086
01:51:01,154 --> 01:51:04,046
Bastard! We've all
worked hard for it

1087
01:51:05,046 --> 01:51:09,801
Chief, we will not let him take a
single drop of water from this well!

1088
01:51:09,801 --> 01:51:12,216
His wife is expecting..

1089
01:51:13,216 --> 01:51:18,408
We'll give him only one bowl
of water for the unborn baby

1090
01:51:19,408 --> 01:51:19,949
..Every day!

1091
01:51:20,949 --> 01:51:23,645
You are right..

1092
01:51:24,645 --> 01:51:25,738
Let's go

1093
01:51:28,738 --> 01:51:31,672
Please believe me.
I am telling the truth

1094
01:51:48,672 --> 01:51:52,106
You'll spare me water
from my own well!

1095
01:51:55,106 --> 01:51:58,310
Come Kesar...we'll go
to your village

1096
01:51:59,310 --> 01:52:00,662
I am their son-in-law

1097
01:52:01,662 --> 01:52:02,546
Bakka belongs
to them now

1098
01:52:13,546 --> 01:52:14,837
See, chief

1099
01:52:16,837 --> 01:52:18,503
You did what
you wanted..

1100
01:52:20,503 --> 01:52:22,587
You said, "He's the God of water.
He'll get us water!"

1101
01:52:23,587 --> 01:52:26,167
"He's a govt. employee!"
I didn't say anything..

1102
01:52:26,167 --> 01:52:27,783
He isn't capable of
finding water..

1103
01:52:28,783 --> 01:52:30,279
Nor is he a govt.
employee any more...

1104
01:52:30,279 --> 01:52:33,671
This bastard is a thief,
who killed his own friend

1105
01:52:34,671 --> 01:52:39,073
Look at the blunder you've
committed at your age, chief!

1106
01:52:40,073 --> 01:52:43,256
Bakka and Kesar will not be
allowed inside this village

1107
01:52:44,256 --> 01:52:47,353
Even if you allow, I won't
let them stay here..

1108
01:52:47,353 --> 01:52:48,712
Let's see,
what you can do

1109
01:52:49,712 --> 01:52:52,912
Yes chief, we won't allow
them in this village

1110
01:53:00,912 --> 01:53:02,003
Go back.. leave!

1111
01:53:04,003 --> 01:53:09,770
Dig up the entire desert
and find your own well..

1112
01:53:10,770 --> 01:53:13,592
Drink all the
water you want

1113
01:53:15,592 --> 01:53:16,951
Get lost..!

1114
01:54:01,951 --> 01:54:02,827
Bakka..

1115
01:54:03,827 --> 01:54:05,398
Water!

1116
01:54:07,398 --> 01:54:08,993
Bakka, water..

1117
01:54:09,993 --> 01:54:12,944
Kesar, I can feel the dampness
We'll find water. Get up!

1118
01:54:12,944 --> 01:54:15,469
You don't believe me?

1119
01:54:16,469 --> 01:54:18,886
How can I believe you, Bakka?

1120
01:54:20,886 --> 01:54:22,912
Your tongue is also parched

1121
01:54:44,912 --> 01:54:47,358
Vela bhai..
did you find water?

1122
01:54:47,358 --> 01:54:48,632
There's no water
anywhere..

1123
01:55:16,632 --> 01:55:18,412
Who's there?

1124
01:55:18,412 --> 01:55:19,078
Who is it?

1125
01:55:20,078 --> 01:55:21,328
Who is it?

1126
01:55:21,328 --> 01:55:23,412
Give me one
bowl of water

1127
01:55:23,412 --> 01:55:24,506
Just one
- You!

1128
01:55:25,506 --> 01:55:28,662
My child needs water
- Stealing water from my house!

1129
01:55:28,662 --> 01:55:30,373
My child will die..

1130
01:55:31,373 --> 01:55:32,725
Bloody thief!

1131
01:55:33,725 --> 01:55:35,698
Vela Bhai
- Look there

1132
01:55:35,698 --> 01:55:37,661
He was stealing water

1133
01:55:42,661 --> 01:55:47,313
Chief, Bakka has
created a nuisance

1134
01:55:47,313 --> 01:55:51,095
Keeps sneaking into
people's houses

1135
01:55:53,095 --> 01:55:57,659
Chief, please give me one
extra bowl of water today

1136
01:56:00,659 --> 01:56:07,134
My child is growing...
needs water

1137
01:56:13,134 --> 01:56:17,201
Chief, pay heed..

1138
01:56:17,201 --> 01:56:19,315
..and do something
about him

1139
01:56:19,315 --> 01:56:20,672
Otherwise he
will ruin us all

1140
01:56:21,672 --> 01:56:24,324
First it was Rakla...

1141
01:56:24,324 --> 01:56:26,079
Then the gold...

1142
01:56:26,079 --> 01:56:28,172
And then this drought

1143
01:56:28,172 --> 01:56:29,867
Think of something!

1144
01:56:30,867 --> 01:56:33,662
Vela Bhai is right.
- Do something chief!

1145
01:56:33,662 --> 01:56:34,993
Teach him a lesson!

1146
01:56:35,993 --> 01:56:38,323
Tie this rascal & drag him
to the middle of the desert

1147
01:57:26,323 --> 01:57:27,324
Ae Kesar..

1148
01:57:30,324 --> 01:57:32,072
What happened?

1149
01:57:38,072 --> 01:57:40,337
Water...
Give me water, Puniya

1150
01:57:47,337 --> 01:57:48,613
Your father did not
give you any water?

1151
01:57:54,613 --> 01:57:57,625
My...my child's thirsty

1152
01:57:59,625 --> 01:58:00,904
Give me water

1153
01:58:01,904 --> 01:58:03,654
I am thirsty too

1154
01:58:04,654 --> 01:58:05,779
Shall I quench your thirst?

1155
01:58:08,779 --> 01:58:10,154
What happened?

1156
01:58:14,154 --> 01:58:15,074
Shall I?

1157
01:58:16,074 --> 01:58:16,904
Don't run...

1158
01:58:25,904 --> 01:58:29,809
Oh...what are you doing?
You are carrying a child. It will die

1159
01:58:30,809 --> 01:58:32,029
Kesar, careful...

1160
01:58:33,029 --> 01:58:34,224
You'll get hurt

1161
01:58:50,224 --> 01:58:54,694
Spare me today; I'll let you do another day...
- No, no...Not another day

1162
01:58:54,694 --> 01:58:56,230
Not fair...

1163
01:58:56,230 --> 01:58:59,028
I have to quench my
thirst today

1164
01:58:59,028 --> 01:59:02,880
Don't be scared. It'll be fun,
sit comfortably

1165
01:59:02,880 --> 01:59:04,587
I've waited for you
for so long

1166
01:59:06,587 --> 01:59:08,701
Be calm.
We'll do it gently

1167
01:59:09,701 --> 01:59:10,681
Ae Puniya!

1168
01:59:11,681 --> 01:59:13,792
You scoundrel!
Leave her...

1169
01:59:15,792 --> 01:59:18,109
What the...!
What's her problem?

1170
01:59:19,109 --> 01:59:19,652
You stay...wait

1171
01:59:20,652 --> 01:59:22,402
Listen...

1172
01:59:22,402 --> 01:59:24,479
Go towards the desert

1173
01:59:24,479 --> 01:59:28,775
And find somebody
for yourself...

1174
01:59:32,775 --> 01:59:36,283
I had heard there is just
one lion in this desert

1175
01:59:37,283 --> 01:59:39,079
Have you given
up hunting?

1176
01:59:41,079 --> 01:59:42,471
...living off leftovers?

1177
01:59:42,471 --> 01:59:45,568
Why are you after my life?
What's your problem?

1178
01:59:46,568 --> 01:59:49,818
An old lion, you've become ...
Setting up bait...

1179
01:59:50,818 --> 01:59:53,109
...settling for
whatever comes your way

1180
01:59:53,109 --> 01:59:57,658
Look at her, she's so helpless.
She's pregnant. Hungry and thirsty

1181
02:00:00,658 --> 02:00:01,692
You are a man, right?

1182
02:00:03,692 --> 02:00:04,680
Want to show
your manhood?

1183
02:00:07,680 --> 02:00:08,858
Do you?

1184
02:00:10,858 --> 02:00:14,315
Show me then!

1185
02:00:15,315 --> 02:00:16,488
I am a virgin

1186
02:01:50,488 --> 02:01:55,072
Keep giving water!

1187
02:01:59,072 --> 02:02:02,685
Lion made the kill!

1188
02:02:29,685 --> 02:02:34,481
I'll take the burden of this
favour to my grave, Kajri

1189
02:02:37,481 --> 02:02:39,268
Bakka has been a part of me
since childhood

1190
02:02:45,268 --> 02:02:47,076
If you were not carrying
Bakka's child..

1191
02:02:49,076 --> 02:02:51,268
..I would not have even
looked back

1192
02:02:54,268 --> 02:02:58,997
Here...give water
to your child

1193
02:03:24,997 --> 02:03:27,100
I, Bakka..

1194
02:03:27,100 --> 02:03:29,189
I was called 'god of water'

1195
02:03:29,189 --> 02:03:34,265
I found water for others
and today..

1196
02:03:39,265 --> 02:03:42,104
Since I was a little girl,
I have been hearing..

1197
02:03:42,104 --> 02:03:43,677
..Bakka will find water

1198
02:03:43,677 --> 02:03:45,850
Bakka is the god of water!
What's happened to this god?

1199
02:03:48,850 --> 02:03:53,693
You are the hope of this dry,
burning desert

1200
02:03:55,693 --> 02:03:57,222
It's not Bakka's fault, Kajri

1201
02:03:59,222 --> 02:03:59,722
It's my fault!

1202
02:04:02,722 --> 02:04:08,515
Your prayers helped him.
This was your right. I took it away

1203
02:04:11,515 --> 02:04:13,222
Now you perform the rite...

1204
02:04:14,222 --> 02:04:16,448
Then Bakka will find water

1205
02:05:35,448 --> 02:05:39,006
Bakka, water..

1206
02:05:41,006 --> 02:05:44,640
Bakka, water..

1207
02:05:54,640 --> 02:05:57,934
Bakka!

1208
02:06:04,934 --> 02:06:05,862
Kesar!

1209
02:06:08,862 --> 02:06:09,782
Kesar!

1210
02:06:09,782 --> 02:06:11,551
We got water
in our well

1211
02:06:15,551 --> 02:06:20,728
I got water for you...

1212
02:06:35,728 --> 02:06:39,400
Rain in desert!
How is it possible?

1213
02:06:51,400 --> 02:06:51,600
Kesar!

1214
02:06:53,600 --> 02:06:54,926
Get up

1215
02:06:56,926 --> 02:06:58,587
See, there is water
in our well

1216
02:07:01,587 --> 02:07:03,742
Kesar, Kesar!

1217
02:07:04,742 --> 02:07:07,197
Get up Kesar!

1218
02:07:08,197 --> 02:07:12,470
See, we got water..

1219
02:07:12,470 --> 02:07:13,546
Kesar, get up!

1220
02:08:06,546 --> 02:08:12,087
Bakka, the God of water...
who found water for everybody

1221
02:08:14,087 --> 02:08:17,146
He was never
seen after that

1222
02:08:33,146 --> 02:08:34,502
Hello...
Is this Bakka's house?

1223
02:08:35,502 --> 02:08:36,500
Yes...
