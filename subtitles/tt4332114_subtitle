1
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:37,920
"Dolly."

2
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:38,580
"Dolly."

3
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:39,210
"Dolly."

4
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:39,790
"Dolly."

5
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:41,710
"Dolly's palanquin."

6
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:03,960
No.

7
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:06,040
After we're married.

8
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:07,710
So let's get married.

9
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:11,830
It's not as easy as plucking
sugarcane from your field.

10
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,540
How long have we known each other?

11
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:16,040
It's only been two months.

12
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,380
But I already feel
like I've known you for ages, Dolly.

13
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:20,460
There's nothing more I want to know.

14
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,250
Your family will never agree to this,
nor will mine.

15
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:24,210
To hell with our families.
Who cares!

16
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,960
My name's Sonu Sehrawat!

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,630
If they don't let us get married..

18
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:30,210
..I will lay down on the train tracks.

19
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:32,380
Then they will beg you to come home.

20
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:33,670
I see.

21
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:35,130
And what about my father,
who's an army man?

22
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:37,460
So?
Do I have Fungus all over me?

23
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,960
Anything wrong with me?
I also fought the village court elections.

24
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:41,790
Okay. I lost.

25
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:43,500
So what? Most people do.

26
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:45,830
But I'm the expected to win next time..

27
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,000
And I just sold sugarcane
worth 2 million.

28
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:51,580
If my father yells at you,
you'll pee in your pants.

29
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:54,040
Nonsense, yell at me!

30
00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:00,420
Dolly, you're the only
one who takes me lightly.

31
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:04,420
We deal more in guns than sugarcanes.

32
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:05,920
Don't be mistaken.

33
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:07,920
I am from Haryana.

34
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,580
Don't ever say I'll pee
in my pants, again.

35
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,880
Yell at me.

36
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:19,420
Yes.

37
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:21,790
Sonu.
- Oh! Brother in law!

38
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:24,290
I'm sorry, I hope you
won't mind me calling you that.

39
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:26,170
No, no. I don't mind.

40
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:27,330
Raju.
- Yeah.

41
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,330
How are you?
- Great.

42
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:31,380
Your jacket's really nice.
- Nice?

43
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:32,580
Yes.
- You keep it.

44
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:34,290
No. - Keep it.
- What are you saying?

45
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:36,710
Keep it, we're family now. Keep it.
- Thank you.

46
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:37,710
Will it fit you?
- Yeah.

47
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:40,040
It will, I am losing weight.

48
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,540
Is papa at home?
- Yes.

49
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,460
Papa.
- Yes.

50
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,380
He's Sonu Sehrawat, Dolly's friend.

51
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:48,250
He wants to talk to you.

52
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:50,420
Hello, uncle.
- Hello.

53
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:53,290
I need to discuss
something about Dolly.

54
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:55,040
What is it?

55
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:56,750
Say it.

56
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:58,250
I want to marry, Dolly.

57
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:02,830
What? What?

58
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,210
I want to marry, Dolly.

59
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,000
Why you?

60
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:10,960
Talking about marriage
bloody civilian.

61
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,830
Out!

62
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,750
Out!

63
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:15,330
What's going on?

64
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:19,630
Papa, if sister's given her consent..

65
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:21,040
..how can you behave like this?

66
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:24,580
No, but still, papa.

67
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:25,460
Shut up!

68
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,420
Are there no elders in his house?

69
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,540
He's come here to
discuss his own marriage..

70
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:31,790
..like an asshole. Out.

71
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:32,960
Why is he misbehaving?

72
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:34,750
When he's out in the sun too long..

73
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:36,080
..his blood pressure rises.

74
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:37,290
It often happens.

75
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:39,790
Throw him out.
- Papa can't behave like this.

76
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:42,460
Sonu's my friend.
- I know, dear, but..

77
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,210
Is she Dolly's mother?

78
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:46,420
Greetings, mother.
It's fine, mom.

79
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:49,080
Son, get your parents to meet us.

80
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:51,080
I'll talk to her father.
Okay?

81
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:53,290
Fine, talk to him all you want.

82
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:56,250
We aren't beggars. We're landlords.

83
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,670
Just last year I made
2 million selling sugarcanes.

84
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:01,040
I'm also active in politics.

85
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,460
I fought the village court elections also.

86
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,630
If I wanted, I could've eloped
with your daughter.

87
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,130
But I didn't want to hurt her Papa's feeling.

88
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:09,790
But papa's trying to break my skull.

89
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:11,960
Really?
Thank you for honoring me.

90
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,420
Goodbye.

91
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:15,000
Brother in law, your jacket.

92
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:16,380
Keep it.

93
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,460
Thank you, brother in law.

94
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:29,080
Oh, Lord!

95
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:32,170
I can't handle these chores anymore.

96
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:34,380
Ask Imarti to do them.

97
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:35,710
Have patience.

98
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:38,580
In the next marriage, for you
- What?

99
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:39,750
What next marriage?

100
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:40,960
Bring a mistress for me?

101
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,580
Your mind's completely messed up.

102
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:43,790
I was trying to say 'daughter in law'...

103
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:45,290
...but you think I'll
bring home a 'mistress' instead.

104
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:47,580
All you two do is quarrel.

105
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,460
I wonder how Dolly will adjust
herself in this environment.

106
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,880
Dolly?

107
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:57,380
In your marriage,
your only job will be to sit on the horse.

108
00:04:57,420 --> 00:05:00,500
Just make sure you don't fall.
Leave the rest to your father.

109
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:01,580
Everything else.

110
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:05,000
I'll marry only Dolly.

111
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,880
And if I don't
I'll commit suicide.

112
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:10,250
Then you can keep
my body on that horse.

113
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:12,250
Stop bluffing, and prove it.

114
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,380
You think I am bluffing.

115
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:17,710
Fine, I'll prove it today.
Wait.

116
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,080
Son.
- Stay there.

117
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,330
I've had enough of him.

118
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:23,130
I'm going to end my story
by drinking this pesticide.

119
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:25,630
Don't curse yourself later..

120
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:27,540
..that your only son committed suicide.
Okay.

121
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:28,580
Drink it.

122
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:30,580
Son, you've lost your mind.
Don't do it.

123
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:31,790
Let go, mom.

124
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:34,250
Are you going to drink that already?

125
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:36,170
Hear that, mother. I'm going to drink it.
- Let go, son.

126
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:37,040
Listen to me.

127
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:42,080
Your father is still capable
of expanding his lineage.

128
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:46,000
Have you lost your mind?

129
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:47,380
I have only one son.

130
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:49,250
If anything happens to him..

131
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:51,580
..how will I live with a husband like you?

132
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:54,000
I'd rather not have a son.

133
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:57,540
Go on.
Marry anyone you want.

134
00:05:58,330 --> 00:05:59,460
I do want to get married.

135
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,250
But you two will have to
come and fix everything.

136
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:04,920
Tell him to get ready.

137
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,250
He can't go looking like this.

138
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:07,080
Take him away.

139
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:08,750
Carry him in your arms.

140
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,330
I'll keep that.
- No.

141
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:12,420
I'll just keep it back.

142
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:34,210
I was saying that monsoon
starts in July..

143
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:35,710
..so, we should get married before.
- Yes.

144
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:38,000
Hold on, hold your horses.
Don't be so impatient.

145
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,830
First, Major and I will talk
about the important stuff.

146
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:43,380
Important stuff?

147
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:44,670
Of course.

148
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:47,500
Raju, briefcase.
- Yes.

149
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:53,380
I saved this sum of money
for my daughter Dolly.

150
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,710
No, Papa. We can't accept this.
This is wrong.

151
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,040
Don't interfere.

152
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,710
By the way, how much is it?

153
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,080
It's not for you.

154
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,040
It's for my daughter
and son in law.

155
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:08,420
Small gift.

156
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:09,960
29th is a good date.

157
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:12,000
You can get these
two married on that day.

158
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,080
29th is wonderful.
- Final.

159
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,580
And another thing,
I'll invite the orchestra too.

160
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:18,630
Wonderful.
- He's got the best DJ.

161
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:19,710
Why don't you invite
everyone in Haryana?

162
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:24,380
Aunty, are you happy?

163
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:27,130
We've given you our daughter,
we've given you everything.

164
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:30,380
She's ours now.

165
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:31,880
Right, absolutely right.

166
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,710
Great.

167
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:39,880
Stand together.

168
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,830
Hold on. Hold on.
I'll stand next to Major sir.

169
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,830
Major sir, closer.
- Smile please.

170
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:46,290
Hello.

171
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,670
1, 2, 3. 1, 2, 3.
Mic testing!

172
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:51,540
Mic testing.

173
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:52,920
Hello. Hello.

174
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:54,290
Brother in law.
- Raju.

175
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,380
Where were you?
- Here.

176
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:57,540
Jacket's looking amazing.

177
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:58,710
Come on, brother in law.

178
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,210
It fits.
- Yeah, I got it altered.

179
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:01,710
Hey red coat.
Come here.

180
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:03,540
Yes.

"The signal's clear at the station."

238
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:28,960
"Super duper taste and a 26' waist."

239
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
"Your weight's like paper."

240
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,670
"You.."

241
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,500
"You mingle in like sugar in tea."

242
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:36,250
"And leave really, really quickly."

243
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:39,500

244
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,500

"And hope for the boys."

247
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:03,420
Milk.

248
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:09,790
I am not the kind of daughter in law..

249
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:11,630
..who gives milk only to her husband.

250
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:14,130
I'll give it to everyone.

251
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,960
Thank you.

252
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,880
Listen.
What are you doing here?

253
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:34,040
Sonu must be waiting for you.
Go on.

254
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:36,500
What?

255
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:39,630
I've brought milk for you.
- Bless you.

256
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:43,080
Listen, dear.
Give me all your jewelry.

257
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:44,580
These are bad times.

258
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:46,630
Yes.

259
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:02,170
Now I've the permission to kiss you.

260
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:06,750
Drink your milk.
- All I get is milk tonight?

261
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,040
Drink it, or you'll regret it.

262
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:11,960
I'll regret it?

263
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:14,000
You'll regret it.

264
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,380
What's the big deal.
I've had this stuff all my life.

265
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,000
Come on.

266
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,130
Not tonight, Sonu.
I'm fasting tonight.

267
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:34,500
So.

268
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:37,170
Get some sleep,
or the lord will feel offended.

269
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,170
It's 12 o'clock,
technically the day's over.

270
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:41,540
I observe it for 24 hours, not 12.

271
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:43,000
This is cheating, Dolly.

272
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:48,830
Sleep, Sonu. I am tired.

273
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:51,330
At least give me a kiss.

274
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:53,170
I said I am fasting.

275
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:59,500
I had plans of losing mine,
and you're fasting instead.

276
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:05,170
Alright, at least turn towards me.

277
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:06,330
Goodnight, Sonu.

278
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:10,830
Can I at least touch you?

279
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,290
Sonu, goodnight.

280
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:41,380
Dolly!

281
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:52,290
Dolly!

282
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:58,540
Dolly!

283
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:06,000
Dolly!

284
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:09,380
Papa.

285
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:11,750
Wake up.

286
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:15,330
Wake up, I can't find Dolly. Get up.
- Let me sleep.

287
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:16,710
Stand up. Wake up.

288
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:19,580
Why are you screaming?
- I can't find Dolly.

289
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:21,080
She must be somewhere around.

290
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:22,670
She isn't answering.
Wake up now.

291
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,670
First I get him married..

292
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:27,080
..and now,
He is asking me to find his wife.

293
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:28,500
My head's spinning.

294
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:29,540
She..

295
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:32,080
What?

296
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:35,130
What happened?

297
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:35,830
Look.

298
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:38,500
She isn't here.

299
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,040
That bitch has eloped with her lover.

300
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,670
Go take a look inside.
She stole everything.

301
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:46,170
You've lost your mind.
- I've not.

302
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,000
The bitch even took my chain.

303
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:03,540
Excuse me.

304
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,710
Didn't SK Singh live here?

305
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:06,960
SK Singh who?

306
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:09,080
The Major, who lived with his family.

307
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:11,830
They left.
I guess they didn't like the place.

308
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:13,330
But who are you?

309
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,290
A relative?

310
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,040
Must be a friend then?

311
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:18,880
Acquaintance?

312
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:20,830
Then why did you ask me?

313
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:22,420
Wasting my time.

314
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:25,080
Get lost.
- You only called me.

315
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:27,420
Mad man. I was just helping you.

316
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,500
Hey Mr. Helper! Come here.

317
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:33,960
Come.

318
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,380
She screwed us.

319
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,040
That's why we're asking.

320
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:41,880
Will you let us screw you?

321
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:44,330
You called me to help you.

322
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:45,710
Help us.

323
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:48,460
You shouldn't help anyone these days.
I guess they're sick.

324
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,000
How about drinking that pesticide now?

325
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:53,710
Get in the car.

326
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:58,790
Dolly.
- Wait.

327
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,330
I'm going to clobber you.

328
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:01,750
Where are you going?

329
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:07,250
I think my wife's been kidnapped.

330
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:10,380
Do you have a photo?

331
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:13,830
What's wrong?

332
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:16,630
Show me her photo?
What are you thinking?

333
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,080
I don't have one.
- What?

334
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:21,960
You don't have a picture of your wife.

335
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:34,960
I get it.

336
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:39,460
Your wife eloped with her lover.

337
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:41,830
She's never coming back.

338
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,210
And you're filing a report like a fool.

339
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:45,960
Shut up will you.

340
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:48,330
Don't try to act smart in that uniform.

341
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:58,250
Don't ever come back
here to file a complaint.

342
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:02,380
500 guests in the wedding..

343
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:04,500
..and no one took a single picture?

344
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:06,380
You're out of your mind.

345
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:08,500
We'll be humiliated.

346
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:11,130
No one's going to marry
your beloved son.

347
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:14,130
As if the world will never know.

348
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:17,250
Yes, I don't know anybody else
but they will definitely find out from you.

349
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:21,880
Just say that daughter in law's
visiting her parents.

350
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:22,880
Get that?

351
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:26,000
Later we'll tell everybody she's dead.

352
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:28,380
That's why he's re-marrying him.

353
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:39,170
Come in.

354
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,630
Yes, Robin.

355
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:49,580
Listen, areas close to Delhi..

356
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:52,790
..like Meerut, Sonipat,
Ghaziabad, Gurgaon..

357
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:54,500
..there have been cases of robbery.

358
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:55,540
In the same style.

359
00:19:56,170 --> 00:19:58,210
Someone called Dolly.

360
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:01,580
First she marries her victim
and then flees with the stash.

361
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:03,250
We want this girl at any cost.

362
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:04,920
I want you to handle this case.

363
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:09,670
Madam, don't get me involved
in these petty cases.

364
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,170
Unnecessarily I'll have to go from
town to town searching for this girl.

365
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:14,580
You're too much, Robin.

366
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:17,880
Alright. Then refer me
a team of capable people.

367
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:20,540
I want this girl at any cost, okay?

368
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:25,040
Jai Hind.
- Jai Hind.

369
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:28,170
Hukum Singh.

370
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:30,420
Sir.

371
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:33,330
You're still a bachelor, right?
- Yes, sir.

372
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:34,790
Case of the plundering bride.

373
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:36,580
You lead this case.

374
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:37,830
Thank you, sir.

375
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:39,420
Plundering bride?

376
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:42,080
What are you saying, sir?

377
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:45,290
You're giving this
girls case to a teenager.

378
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:46,670
You think he can handle it?

379
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,500
I've worked really long with sir.

380
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:50,710
I can handle this case alone.

381
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:51,920
Look, sir.

382
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:54,920
She looks so innocent.
- Marries the victim.

383
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:59,580
What's she done?
- and then flees with the valuables.

384
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:09,830
Madam, I want to handle
the case of the plundering bride.

385
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:12,040
Why?

386
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:14,250
Bored of sitting in
in the police station?

387
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,830
Now you want to kick
dirt looking for this girl?

388
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:21,250
Even if the world is a haystack

389
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,330
But dolly's no needle.

390
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:26,040
I'll find her in 2 months.

391
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:01,670
"She's like a heavenly angel."

392
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:05,040
"Makes you dance to her
tunes with her sweet talks."

393
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:14,380
"She's like a heavenly angel."

394
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,630
"Makes you dance to her
tunes with her sweet talks."

395
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,380
"Enchants everyone with.."

396
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:21,040
"..her smiles and giggles."

397
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:24,670
"Like a sweet and sour peppermint pill."

398
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:27,750
"A bundle of fireworks."

399
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:30,380
"Gets to you like a bottle of liquor."

400
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:31,960
"God help me."

401
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,630
"Lord help me."

402
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:37,420
"That innocent face
makes me an austere."

403
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:41,000
Father.

404
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:46,540
"Here."

405
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:47,500
"Here."

406
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:48,540
"Here."

407
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:49,880
"Here."

408
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,750
"Here."

409
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:56,630
"Here comes
Dolly's palanquin."

410
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:04,630
She's stolen with everything.

411
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:07,960
She's a thief.

412
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,040
A fraud.

413
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:11,460
Stop whining and tell me
what happened?

414
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,540
15 boys. 15 girls.

415
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:47,580
And 20 uncles.

416
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:49,630
Not a problem.
- Send 30 aunties.

417
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:51,170
And charge properly.

418
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,540
Get me some amazing aunties.

419
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:54,880
You know, aunties set the mood.

420
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,750
Sir, you'll get the best
aunties for 1000 rupees.

421
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:59,210
No, I'll pay you only 600.
That's it.

422
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:02,630
Brother, are aunties
really available for 600?

423
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:08,580
"Skirting eyes
and the sways and gaits."

424
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:11,080
"She's ready and out to prey."

425
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:14,250
"Don't touch, only look."

426
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:18,130
"She'll laugh and play,
and if you touch she'll fly away."

427
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:21,250
"She's a strange,
but close to you."

428
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:24,920
"A companion,
but full of deceit."

429
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:28,630
"A bundle of fireworks.
Gets to you like a bottle of liquor."

430
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:31,170
"God help me."

431
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:33,040
"Lord help me."

432
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,750
"Lord help me."

433
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:37,750
"That innocent face
makes me an austere."

434
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,130
"She's devotion, but also a sin."

435
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:04,290
"She's love, but also punishment."

436
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:08,330
"She gets what she wants."

437
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:11,500
"She laughs, giggles and.."

438
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:13,960
"..steals your life with her eyes."

439
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,080
"She's an obsession,
and passion as well."

440
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:19,710
"She's visible, and lost too."

441
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:22,920
"A bundle of fireworks.
Gets to you like a bottle of liquor."

442
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,790
"God help me."

443
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:29,080
"Lord help me."

444
00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:32,830
"That innocent face
makes me an austere."

445
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,290
I am sorry. He is my brother.

446
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:44,580
Brother..

447
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:45,380
"Here."

448
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:46,250
"Here."

449
00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:47,380
"Here."

450
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:52,290
"Here comes
Dolly's palanquin."

451
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,500
"Here comes
Dolly's palanquin."

452
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:09,630
"Dolly."

453
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:10,630
"Dolly."

454
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,080
"Dolly's palanquin."

455
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:19,790
Mom's tasty potato stuffed bread.

456
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:25,750
They're hot.
- Very hot.

457
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:29,460
Wow, potato stuffed bread again.
- Yes.

458
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:31,960
Why don't you make meat some day?

459
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,210
Make them yourself.

460
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:34,920
Dubeyji, on my next wedding..

461
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:39,380
..instruct the chef to make
special mutton for my brother.

462
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:42,080
Yes, of course.
We'll get meat made specially for him.

463
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:45,500
But his job is to find a groom,
which he isn't doing.

464
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,880
And it's no longer his cup of tea.

465
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,380
Ranjeet Dhillon.

466
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:51,710
Returned from Australia.
- Next.

467
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:54,500
Why?

468
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,460
Did you see his face?

469
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,960
Looks like bird soup.
- You don't need to..

470
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,420
..drink this soup all your life.

471
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:03,540
Only till midnight.

472
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:05,920
I've something to say.

473
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:13,040
Look, I do all the
research on the party.

474
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:15,920
I also bring all the proposals.

475
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:18,210
I'll do everything, but..

476
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:21,330
..I won't pose as Dolly's brother.

477
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,290
What are you saying?

478
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:29,540
You've the opportunity..

479
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:32,500
..to be the brother of a beautiful girl..
And you refusing?

480
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:33,670
Why don't you do it?

481
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:36,750
What's he saying?

482
00:27:38,210 --> 00:27:39,290
What else can you do?

483
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:40,790
Anything.

484
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:42,420
I'll do photography.

485
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,750
Hey, what are you saying?

486
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:46,420
You'll do photography?

487
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:50,380
The day anyone recognize Dolly
In the photographs taken by me, I will quit.

488
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:51,380
Take a retirement!

489
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:53,580
You're trying to ruin.
- To hell with this gang.

490
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,130
I won't pose as Dolly's brother.

491
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:01,630
Raju!
Raju! Raju!

492
00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:03,830
What a stupid boy.

493
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:05,920
What happened?

494
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:07,710
Someone died.

495
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:10,000
- Yes.
- Who?

496
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:11,830
The brother.

497
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:27,790
Don't try to convince me, Dolly.

498
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,790
You know you can easily convince me.

499
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:35,670
But, try to understand me instead.

500
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:40,420
I'm in love, what to do.

501
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:43,500
All I'm saying is that
I won't pose as your brother.

502
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:44,380
Am I asking you for too much?

503
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:46,920
I know you will never marry me.

504
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:49,170
You're used to rich grooms.

505
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:52,670
But marry me, just for the sake of it.

506
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,500
I will pose as your brother
for the rest of my life.

507
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:55,830
I won't even ask for my share.

508
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:58,960
You know I am not made for love.

509
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:02,290
You're the only one
who understands me.

510
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:05,790
You can't do this to us.

511
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:12,750
I was saying.

512
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:15,170
This one.
This one here.

513
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:19,540
You see, there's a vacancy
only for a brother in our gang.

514
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:23,710
Don't pick fights.

515
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:25,960
Everyone's in a bad mood.

516
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:29,170
I said I am sorry,
- You're such a miser.

517
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:32,130
They'll all be okay when
I bring them another proposal.

518
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:33,960
Cheers.

519
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:39,710
Heartiest congratulations for
the selection buddy!

520
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,790
Thanks.
- You don't know.

521
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:44,540
He just got a job,
but he had to bribe for it.

522
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:46,420
That's true.

523
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:47,670
I found a link through my uncle.

524
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:49,460
Yet I had to pay 1 million
to get the job.

525
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:50,920
Don't worry.

526
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:54,830
The guy in the blue shirt,
he's our next target.

527
00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:56,540
He's Dolly's perfect groom.

528
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,960
Stop shooting blanks.

529
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,790
Things like these need research.
Research.

530
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:04,580
Research.

531
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:07,250
I need a beautiful,
but homely kind of girl.

532
00:30:07,290 --> 00:30:08,500
You know my mom.

533
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:10,170
I know.
But listen.

534
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:13,040
As soon as your marriage is fixed..

535
00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:15,790
..first learn all the
tricks of the trade from me.

536
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,250
Tricks?

537
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:21,170
Start eating almonds,
walnuts and Shilajeet.

538
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:22,710
Why? What for?

539
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:25,170
Almonds for a sharp mind.

540
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:27,250
Walnuts for your heart.

541
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:29,130
And I don't need to tell you
what Shilajeet's for.

542
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,830
I can look at any guy..

543
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:35,960
..and tell you whether
he's single or married.

544
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:39,460
And if he's single,
is he having an affair or not.

545
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:42,420
And if he isn't,
then how impatient he's for marriage..

546
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:43,880
..and what kind of girl
he's looking for. Understand?

547
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:46,750
Matches are made in heaven.

548
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,420
We only abide by them in this world.

549
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:50,040
Say that again, Dubeyji.

550
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,330
You've been fumbling over
the same dialogue since morning.

551
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:53,460
Watch now.

552
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:55,080
Matches are made in heaven.

553
00:30:55,130 --> 00:30:57,750
We only abide by them in this world.
How's that?

554
00:30:57,790 --> 00:31:00,000
Amazing, I see you're preparing.
- Great.

555
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,080
What preparation?

556
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:04,460
We lost that Major Kulwir
Singh because of you.

557
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,790
There are many proposals out there.

558
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:08,330
So get one.

559
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:10,210
Don't just fire blanks in the air.

560
00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:15,960
Name, Manjot Singh Chaddha.
Software Engineer.

561
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,540
Salary, 60,000!

562
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:18,830
Great.
- That's at least means 40.

563
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,880
Superb.
- Age, 27 years.

564
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,380
Height, 5'7.

565
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:24,500
Looks average,
but searching for a beautiful girl.

566
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:27,250
Our girl's really beautiful.
Gorgeous in fact.

567
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:29,500
Yes of course.
Beautiful.

568
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:32,040
Educated too, but she shouldn't
be career oriented.

569
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:35,380
Basically, he's looking
for someone his parents would accept..

570
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:38,500
..obedient, beautiful and virtuous.

571
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:42,630
So Dolly, you've got to be beautiful,
virtuous and obedient.

572
00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:44,000
Wow!

573
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:47,420
But, Dolly, this time the name "Dolly" won't do.
- Why?

574
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:49,880
There have been enough
articles in the newspapers.

575
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,540
The name's too exposed.
- No, no.

576
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:53,000
Dolly's lucky for me.

577
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:55,130
Did we ever get caught
because of my name?

578
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:57,500
Dear, I've a question.

579
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:01,290
What's your name?
- Madhuri Chawla.

580
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:03,920
And you are...

581
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:07,460
He is..

582
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:10,330
My brother.

583
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:15,170
So, he's your brother?
- No. He's my son.

584
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:16,380
He's younger than me.

585
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:18,210
Are they twins?
Must be twins?

586
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:20,750
No, there's a difference. There's a
difference of 5 minutes between the two.

587
00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:23,500
Dear, what's your height?

588
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:25,000
5'9.

589
00:32:26,130 --> 00:32:26,960
She's too tall.

590
00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:29,460
Just like you.
- No, she's too tall.

591
00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:33,880
Are girls normally this tall?
- No.

592
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:37,580
I like your sense of humor.

593
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:40,540
Very funny. Here.

594
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:41,880
What are you doing, Manjot?

595
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,170
He's Manjot.

596
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,420
He's always topped his academics.

597
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:48,920
Very decent, and never had an affair.

598
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,920
My daughter is a graduate.

599
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,830
And she's also done a course in BIT.

600
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,880
That means you sent her
to college for education?

601
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,130
Yes.

602
00:32:57,170 --> 00:32:58,750
I don't understand one thing.

603
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:01,420
Why do parents send
their daughters to college?

604
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:03,420
So that they can learn good values.
Why else?

605
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:06,040
What values?
Colleges are filled with boys.

606
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,500
And they have affairs.

607
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:09,040
They start misbehaving.

608
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:11,210
Daughters should be doing
correspondence course..

609
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:12,500
..right from the comfort of their home.

610
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:14,210
No chance of any affairs.

611
00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:18,630
Such humor.

612
00:33:18,670 --> 00:33:20,130
I like your sense of humor.

613
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:21,580
Very funny.

614
00:33:22,330 --> 00:33:23,880
Can I say something?
- Yes.

615
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:25,880
You have a nice house.

616
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:28,500
Don't call it a house.
It's a manor.

617
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:32,040
And before you insist,
I'll show you my manor.

618
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,040
Yes..
- Come.

619
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:35,380
It's a manor.
We've six bedrooms upstairs.

620
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:37,250
With attached bathroom.

621
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:39,880
We've more space than required.
- Where are you going, dear?

622
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:43,000
You two sit here, and chat.

623
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,250
We'll be right back.

624
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:46,040
Control.
- Sit down, son.

625
00:33:56,750 --> 00:34:01,130
Don't you have a nickname?
- No.

626
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:04,790
Madhuri Chawla.
- Good name.

627
00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:07,290
What's in the name?

628
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:10,880
You don't have a dashing name..

629
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,830
..but, you look like a hero.

630
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:20,830
That's true.

631
00:34:21,130 --> 00:34:22,170
Would you like some?

632
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:31,170
Did you ever have an affair?
- Why?

633
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:34,880
Do I look like I'm that kind of a girl?
- No.

634
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:37,420
I mean these things
are quite common nowadays.

635
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:38,830
So I just asked.

636
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,830
Have you had an affair?

637
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:48,540
No.

638
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:53,290
You see, girls do like me.

639
00:34:53,330 --> 00:34:54,960
You know it's very common.
But..

640
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:58,130
..you know, whenever I post
a picture of myself on Facebook..

641
00:34:58,170 --> 00:35:00,380
..I get 15-17 likes from girls.

642
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,790
By the way,
love marriage is not a bad thing.

643
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:05,130
Nothing wrong.

644
00:35:05,790 --> 00:35:09,630
Yes, but it's nothing good either.

645
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:14,330
These days couples do
everything before marriage.

646
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:16,830
While in a arranged marriage..

647
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:19,580
..we get the opportunity
to know each other.

648
00:35:20,210 --> 00:35:24,920
Like, I don't know you,
and you don't know me.

649
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:28,290
What a wonderful antique
collection you've got.

650
00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:29,830
Wonderful.
Wonderful.

651
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:32,500
Listen to me carefully.

652
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:37,170
She's got wings.
Don't you see how she's been chattering?

653
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:39,830
We'll lose Manjot after they're married.

654
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:43,670
You'll be spending the rest
of your life in some old age home.

655
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:45,960
And I'll go live with Pammi.

656
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:48,130
let's reject her.

657
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:50,000
Wonderful.

658
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:58,380
Well, you must be good people.
- Thank you.

659
00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:00,830
But let's make one thing clear.
- What?

660
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:05,790
Your daughter's taller than our son.

661
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,040
Tall?

662
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:11,710
So, aren't you taller
than your husband?

663
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:14,000
That's because he's
wearing his slippers.

664
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:16,080
But, mom.
- Shut up you fool.

665
00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:17,040
Quiet.

666
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:19,000
We'll think about it and call you.
- No.

667
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,420
There's nothing to think about.
I can't twist words.

668
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:27,500
Mr. Arora's daughter, Pinky she's
just as beautiful as your daughter..

669
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:30,040
..and she isn't that tall either.

670
00:36:30,290 --> 00:36:31,750
She'll be a perfect match for my son.

671
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:33,500
And they own a pickle factory also.

672
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:35,040
But, mom.
- Shut up.

673
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:38,460
Pickle your son in that factory.

674
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:40,790
And have it with stuffed bread.

675
00:36:40,830 --> 00:36:44,580
We don't want our daughter
to marry this fool.

676
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:46,460
Come, dear.
- My son's one in a million.

677
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:48,880
Aunty, don't be so proud of him.

678
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,380
He's an ass.

679
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:53,420
He had to bribe to get a job.
Come on.

680
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,580
Don't eat the fritters, they're stale.
You'll get loose motions.

681
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:56,580
Stale?

682
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:57,630
Madhuri..
- What nonsense.

683
00:36:57,670 --> 00:36:59,710
Keep your crappy sofas.

684
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:01,330
And your roof's completely gone.

685
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:02,500
It'll fall some day on your head.

686
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:04,000
Mummy!
You could've talked to me once.

687
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,920
Shut up you fool.

688
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,920
Look at your face.

689
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,710
So smitten by this girl.

690
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:10,710
Go inside.

691
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:14,420
Fine, it happens sometimes.
We'll find another prey.

692
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:16,670
There's no dearth of boys
in this country. - Right.

693
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:19,170
And some day this boy..

694
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:21,790
What are you doing?

695
00:37:22,330 --> 00:37:24,710
Slowly..
- What are you doing, Dolly?

696
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,170
I am not a kid.

697
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:27,540
Stop trying to reassure me.

698
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:31,830
How dare she reject me?

699
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:34,670
Just because she rejected you,
it doesn't make you a reject.

700
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:37,710
I'm going to teach
that old hag a lesson..

701
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:39,460
..she'll never forget.

702
00:37:41,210 --> 00:37:43,080
Give me all the details of that fool.

703
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:45,790
There's not much about him.

704
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:49,170
He takes the 9am AC
bus from Shadra to CP.

705
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:51,960
And takes the same
bus back at 7pm.

706
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:08,540
Hi.

707
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:11,290
Hi.

708
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:22,500
Madhuri, I am really
sorry for the other day.

709
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:25,210
No need to be sorry.

710
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:26,210
It's okay.

711
00:38:26,830 --> 00:38:29,630
No, mom shouldn't have
spoken to you like that.

712
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:30,460
It's okay.

713
00:38:31,130 --> 00:38:34,920
Well, how are your parents?
- They're fine.

714
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,750
And how are you?
- Perfect.

715
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,250
Did you find a bride?

716
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:44,580
Mom's fixed my marriage with
Mr. Arora's daughter Pinky.

717
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:45,580
Okay, good.

718
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:47,580
I have a feeling,
Madhuri, she's a good girl.

719
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:50,210
She must be nice.
Parents only want the best for us.

720
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:54,880
You're still thinking
positively about my parents.

721
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:57,170
I respect transparent people.

722
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:59,960
They didn't like me, I understand.

723
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,830
I felt a bit offended, but it's okay.

724
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:09,880
Has your marriage been fixed?
- Not yet.

725
00:39:11,210 --> 00:39:13,170
I couldn't find a nice boy like you.

726
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:21,670
My stop's here. Best of luck.

727
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:27,500
Come on..

728
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:29,750
Madhuri.

729
00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:30,330
Madhuri.

730
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:34,000
Do you drink coffee?

731
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,790
Who says girls don't drink coffee?

732
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:39,790
Would you like to go out
for coffee with me?

733
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:41,500
Don't you have a job?

734
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:44,670
The country won't shut down
if I don't go to work for one day.

735
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:46,710
And anyway,
I've got 10 casual leaves left.

736
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:48,880
Mom doesn't know.
But I am telling you.

737
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:49,630
Okay.

738
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:55,290
You're not on Facebook.

739
00:39:56,710 --> 00:39:59,630
Those who aren't social,
are on social networking sites.

740
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:00,880
I am very social.

741
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:03,420
You're an amazing girl.

742
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:05,380
I mean you're so witty.

743
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,880
I like girls like you.

744
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:11,420
But mom..
My mom is very dominating.

745
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:12,960
Even my dad surrenders before her.

746
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:17,540
If she hadn't refused I would've
married you. For sure.

747
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:20,500
For that you need to grow up.

748
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,750
You're a kid.

749
00:40:24,830 --> 00:40:26,630
Go home and
sit on your mother's lap.

750
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:28,290
Madhuri, You're getting me wrong.

751
00:40:28,330 --> 00:40:29,540
If I was wrong about you, then..

752
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:31,420
..you would've definitely
said something that day.

753
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:34,920
You're an adult now.

754
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,750
You can make your own decisions.

755
00:40:37,330 --> 00:40:38,040
But...

756
00:40:45,130 --> 00:40:48,130
What did you tell Arora's daughter?

757
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:50,250
Speak up.

758
00:40:50,290 --> 00:40:52,880
That Madhuri's perfect for me.

759
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:54,960
And I'm saying this to you too.

760
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:57,920
I am no longer a kid.
I am a grown up now.

761
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:00,460
I told you that girl will
create rifts in this house.

762
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:01,920
And she did.

763
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:06,000
What rifts?
My heart knows she's the right girl.

764
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,500
Curse you.

765
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:11,000
And despite the way you treated her..

766
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,130
..she still respects you.

767
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:15,040
You're too impatient to get married,
aren't you?

768
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:17,170
So go ahead.
Marry anyone you want.

769
00:41:17,210 --> 00:41:20,210
I'll wear my new sari and be there.
Are you happy now?

770
00:41:20,670 --> 00:41:21,750
Stupid fool.

771
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:24,960
I'm going to tell your
father about your escapades.

772
00:41:27,290 --> 00:41:30,330
Wake up, the house is on fire.

773
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,210
It's the fool calling.

774
00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:35,630
Yes! Pick it up.
You'll be rejected.

775
00:41:36,170 --> 00:41:38,540
Anyways you are not a heroine that someone's
going to break their marriage for you.

776
00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:42,790
Hello.
- Hi.

777
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:46,420
Actually, there's something
I wanted to tell you. - What?

778
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:49,630
My marriage with
Mr. Arora's daughter is not happening.

779
00:41:54,330 --> 00:41:56,330
Ohh, too bad.

780
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:58,500
Yes, it's bad.

781
00:41:58,540 --> 00:42:00,460
But I've already told mom.

782
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:02,750
I'm going to marry
someone better than her.

783
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,380
And do you know who she is?

784
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:05,040
Who?

785
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:06,750
You.

786
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,380
You're going to become
Mrs. Chaddha next month.

787
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:15,000
Please tell uncle and aunty, I mean mom and dad.
We're about to get married.

788
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:20,040
Don't I deserve a kiss atleast.

789
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:21,630
Give it.

790
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:22,960
Give it.

791
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,250
Hello.
- Manjot.

792
00:42:25,290 --> 00:42:28,170
Madhuri, just one kiss.

793
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:32,330
If you don't kiss me,
I'll think you don't like me.

794
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:34,630
I am not a heroine!

795
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:44,130
The information about Dolly is correct.

796
00:42:44,170 --> 00:42:45,330
I assure you.

797
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:48,130
She is marrying with Mr. Chaturvedi.

798
00:42:48,170 --> 00:42:49,420
I know him very well.

799
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:51,580
Let's go.

800
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:57,920
Congrats, dear.

801
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:00,330
Hello, uncle.
- Hello.

802
00:43:01,210 --> 00:43:02,830
Yes, a little to the side.

803
00:43:03,210 --> 00:43:04,330
Thank you.

804
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:06,500
Thank you. Thank you.

805
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:07,920
Finally! You're here.

806
00:43:08,290 --> 00:43:10,130
Why did you come so late?

807
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:11,540
It's your wedding.

808
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:13,580
I need to drink two pegs first. Right!

809
00:43:13,630 --> 00:43:14,500
Nonsense.

810
00:43:16,210 --> 00:43:18,790
What a hot sister in law.

811
00:43:18,830 --> 00:43:20,710
Go have dinner,
or the food will get cold.

812
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:22,830
I will, and I'm going
to drink as well.

813
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:26,460
First, let me get a
good look at my hot sister in law.

814
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:28,170
Move aside.

815
00:43:28,210 --> 00:43:29,670
Move.

816
00:43:30,290 --> 00:43:31,630
Ready?
- Hold on.

817
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:35,380
Say cheese.

818
00:43:36,330 --> 00:43:37,750
My turn.
Now I'll take a picture.

819
00:43:37,790 --> 00:43:39,130
Sir, use this camera.

820
00:43:39,170 --> 00:43:40,920
No, I'm going to use mine.
She's my sister in law.

821
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:41,880
But.

822
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:43,040
No, it's alright.

823
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:44,580
Sister in law.

824
00:43:44,630 --> 00:43:45,710
Sister in law.

825
00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:47,920
Take mine.
- Come on.

826
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:52,540
Sister in law, looks tensed.

827
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:55,000
Wait, I'll take care of that.

828
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:55,920
Waiter.

829
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:58,250
Why did he have
to take my photo?

830
00:43:58,290 --> 00:44:00,460
That's the way he is.
He always does that.

831
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:02,380
I am sorry, please.
- Take good care of sister in law.

832
00:44:02,630 --> 00:44:03,830
Please.
- Here.

833
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:06,790
You're too stubborn.
- That's me.

834
00:44:07,170 --> 00:44:09,330
Here.
- No, thank you.

835
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:10,460
Have it, sister in law.

836
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:12,380
Don't look at him.

837
00:44:12,790 --> 00:44:14,210
This is a Punjabi wedding.

838
00:44:14,250 --> 00:44:17,460
Won't be considered legal
until the couple drinks.

839
00:44:18,170 --> 00:44:18,960
Here.

840
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,630
Should I?
- Drink it. Don't worry.

841
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:26,330
An alcoholic daughter in law.

842
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:27,920
See that.

843
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:31,670
That rascal's offering her a drink
and the wretch's drinking.

844
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:34,170
What's going to happen to my son?

845
00:44:50,250 --> 00:44:53,420
"Don't pay attention
to anything I do today."

846
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:56,080
"I'm going to dance
until I break the floor."

847
00:44:56,130 --> 00:44:58,580
"You've said your cusses."

848
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:01,670
"I've downed my drink."

849
00:45:03,250 --> 00:45:04,670
"You've said your cusses."

850
00:45:04,710 --> 00:45:06,540
"I've downed a drink."

851
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:11,500
"Take a seat
Don't say a word more."

852
00:45:11,830 --> 00:45:15,540
"Call the police,
but I'm going to dance till I drop."

853
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:19,080
"You can do what you want,
but I'm going to dance till I drop."

854
00:45:23,790 --> 00:45:25,830
"I'm going to dance till I drop."

855
00:45:30,670 --> 00:45:32,710
"I'm going to dance till I drop."

856
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:41,380
"Let there be fireworks tonight."

857
00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:43,000
"Oh uncle. Oh aunt."

858
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:46,170
"I'm going to finish that
bottle in a single breath."

859
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,630
"Hey DJ raise the sound."

860
00:45:51,670 --> 00:45:53,380
"I'm going to sway all around."

861
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:56,290
"I'm going to dance all night."

862
00:45:57,170 --> 00:46:00,250
"Don't waste this chance."

863
00:46:00,290 --> 00:46:03,750
"Dance while you're still in the mood."

864
00:46:03,790 --> 00:46:07,170
"Shed all your inhibitions."

865
00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:10,210
"And leave your decency behind."

866
00:46:10,250 --> 00:46:11,750
"You've said your abuses."

867
00:46:11,790 --> 00:46:13,540
"I've downed a drink."

868
00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:18,000
"Take a seat...
Don't say a word more."

869
00:46:18,750 --> 00:46:22,290
"Call the police,
but I'm going to dance till I drop."

870
00:46:22,330 --> 00:46:26,040
"You can do what you want,
but I'm going to dance till I drop."

871
00:46:43,170 --> 00:46:44,750
"I am drunk to the core."

872
00:46:44,790 --> 00:46:46,540
"My brain's stopped working."

873
00:46:46,580 --> 00:46:49,750
"Someone hold me
I might fall down."

874
00:46:49,790 --> 00:46:51,580
"When the drummer beats his drum."

875
00:46:51,630 --> 00:46:53,420
"I forsake all my shame."

876
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:56,460
"How do I explain it to anyone?"

877
00:46:57,210 --> 00:47:00,420
"I try hard day and night."

878
00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:03,920
"Talk only about us."

879
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:07,460
"I can't live without you anymore."

880
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:10,170
"I even want to dance with you."

881
00:47:10,210 --> 00:47:11,880
"You've said your cusses."

882
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:13,750
"I've downed a drink."

883
00:47:13,790 --> 00:47:18,750
"Take a seat.
Don't say a word more."

884
00:47:18,790 --> 00:47:20,790
"Call the police."

885
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:24,380
"You can do what you want."

886
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:29,170
"Call the police,
but I'm going to dance till I drop."

887
00:47:29,210 --> 00:47:32,830
"You can do what you want,
but I'm going to dance till I drop."

888
00:47:35,830 --> 00:47:39,540
"Call the police,
but I'm going to dance till I drop."

889
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:43,170
"You can do what you want,
but I'm going to dance till I drop."

890
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:50,080
"I'm going to dance till I drop."

891
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Excuse me, sir.

892
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:53,790
But..
Dolly means..

893
00:47:53,830 --> 00:47:56,000
You call this a tip?
- I am sorry..

894
00:47:57,790 --> 00:47:59,130
I had a question.

895
00:48:01,290 --> 00:48:02,880
If you..

896
00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:05,670
Go ahead?
- Thank you.

897
00:48:07,170 --> 00:48:10,170
Sir, this girl, Dolly?

898
00:48:11,630 --> 00:48:13,830
Did she pull a fast one
over someone close to you?

899
00:48:15,750 --> 00:48:17,540
This isn't my question?

900
00:48:17,580 --> 00:48:18,790
Just a doubt.

901
00:48:19,790 --> 00:48:21,750
And the rest..

902
00:48:22,830 --> 00:48:26,290
..was ASI Hukum Singh
he was saying this.

903
00:48:26,330 --> 00:48:27,330
To madam.

904
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:31,000
Look, another toaster.

905
00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:33,460
Is there a discount on toaster?

906
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:37,250
See who's at the door.
- Yes.

907
00:48:37,580 --> 00:48:40,380
We'll pass it on to Mr. Gupta
next month at his marriage.

908
00:48:40,420 --> 00:48:41,500
That will be right.

909
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:45,500
Yes?

910
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:46,790
Who are you?

911
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:00,920
Yes.

912
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:02,040
And you are?

913
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:03,290
Me?

914
00:49:03,670 --> 00:49:04,670
I am Dolly's uncle.

915
00:49:05,210 --> 00:49:06,040
Sonu Sehrawat.

916
00:49:08,330 --> 00:49:09,040
Dolly?

917
00:49:10,210 --> 00:49:11,380
But her name is "Madhuri".

918
00:49:11,790 --> 00:49:12,880
Her pet name's Dolly.

919
00:49:13,670 --> 00:49:15,420
When she was a kid
we used to call her Dolly.

920
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:18,250
And, I promised her..

921
00:49:18,670 --> 00:49:20,710
..that, I'll definitely
attend her wedding.

922
00:49:21,710 --> 00:49:23,080
But I am a bit late, Dolly.

923
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:24,830
Sorry, dear.

924
00:49:26,170 --> 00:49:27,080
Childhood?

925
00:49:27,630 --> 00:49:29,630
But you don't look that old.

926
00:49:29,670 --> 00:49:32,080
Actually, it's my complexion
that makes me look young.

927
00:49:32,130 --> 00:49:33,040
Who is he?

928
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:35,330
Her relative.

929
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:37,250
What relative?

930
00:49:37,290 --> 00:49:38,830
What's wrong, Dolly?
Are you angry?

931
00:49:39,250 --> 00:49:41,830
You always greet your uncle.

932
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:43,000
Won't you give me a hug today?

933
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:46,670
Give uncle a hug. Come on.

934
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:49,170
What are you doing here?

935
00:49:49,210 --> 00:49:50,710
I'm here to take you back.

936
00:49:52,170 --> 00:49:54,460
Shall we talk in private
or in front of everyone?

937
00:49:56,130 --> 00:49:57,000
Who is he?

938
00:49:57,420 --> 00:49:58,670
He's one of dad's distant cousins.

939
00:49:59,380 --> 00:50:00,250
How's this possible?

940
00:50:00,290 --> 00:50:02,330
He's Sehrawat and you're Chawla.

941
00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:05,330
His wife's surname is Sehrawat.

942
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:11,040
So he said I'll keep
my wife's surname instead.

943
00:50:12,670 --> 00:50:15,130
Dolly, give me a glass of milk.

944
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,330
You know I can't sleep without
a glass of milk at night.

945
00:50:18,630 --> 00:50:20,580
So where's my room?
Where can I get some rest?

946
00:50:20,630 --> 00:50:23,290
The first room on right.
- I see.

947
00:50:23,330 --> 00:50:25,500
Thank you.
Okay, goodnight.

948
00:50:25,540 --> 00:50:26,880
Goodnight.

949
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:39,040
What drug have you
mixed in it this time?

950
00:50:45,790 --> 00:50:47,170
Dolly, why did you do this to me?

951
00:50:49,290 --> 00:50:50,830
I fought with everyone for you.

952
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:52,040
And you plundered me.

953
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:55,710
All wives' are like that, Sonu.

954
00:50:56,290 --> 00:50:59,580
Those who stay with you forever.

955
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,040
And those who flee the next day.

956
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:05,080
By the way ones that flee,
let you off easy.

957
00:51:12,210 --> 00:51:13,170
What now?

958
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:14,960
Your game's up.

959
00:51:16,580 --> 00:51:17,460
I have a suggestion, Dolly.

960
00:51:17,750 --> 00:51:20,710
You can run away,
like you always do.

961
00:51:23,210 --> 00:51:25,670
But this time
you run away with me.

962
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:27,790
Come on.

963
00:51:29,830 --> 00:51:31,330
I'll set an alarm for 4 o'clock.

964
00:51:31,710 --> 00:51:32,750
Everyone will be sleeping.

965
00:51:32,790 --> 00:51:34,170
And if they aren't,
Then I know you'll put them off to sleep.

966
00:51:36,210 --> 00:51:37,040
Just you and me.

967
00:51:39,210 --> 00:51:40,500
I'll treat you like a queen.

968
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,130
Let's do one thing.

969
00:51:51,750 --> 00:51:54,750
You can make things
right by being a good wife.

970
00:51:57,630 --> 00:51:58,420
Come on.

971
00:51:59,830 --> 00:52:00,790
Really?

972
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:03,710
I love you.

973
00:52:11,250 --> 00:52:12,420
Be here by 4am.

974
00:52:12,750 --> 00:52:14,250
Now go or he'll get suspicious.

975
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:19,080
Thank you, Dolly.

976
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:21,670
And listen.

977
00:52:22,790 --> 00:52:25,500
Don't let that Chaddha touch you.

978
00:52:27,380 --> 00:52:28,380
Don't drink the milk.

979
00:52:45,420 --> 00:52:46,420
Dolly.

980
00:52:52,170 --> 00:52:54,790
The girl's already inviting
her relatives from day one.

981
00:52:54,830 --> 00:52:57,580
This is not a guest house!

982
00:52:58,830 --> 00:53:00,330
Here comes, madam.

983
00:53:00,380 --> 00:53:03,540
Madam, I guess you're sober now.

984
00:53:04,210 --> 00:53:06,830
Do you know
how much you embarrassed us?

985
00:53:07,170 --> 00:53:10,210
These things aren't
allowed in our family.

986
00:53:10,250 --> 00:53:12,880
What was she saying
"I'm going to dance till I drop."

987
00:53:14,170 --> 00:53:14,880
Yes, mom.

988
00:53:15,830 --> 00:53:17,000
Yes, mom.

989
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:23,670
Can you please keep my
jewellery safe along with yours.

990
00:53:27,210 --> 00:53:31,040
These are bad times.
- Of course.

991
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:35,790
Milk for you.
- Oh my..

992
00:53:36,670 --> 00:53:37,540
Listen, dear.

993
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:41,460
If you like, then classical is fine.

994
00:53:41,830 --> 00:53:44,040
But not these absurd one's, alright.

995
00:53:46,290 --> 00:53:47,750
Dad, milk for you.

996
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:49,040
Yes, dear.

997
00:53:50,170 --> 00:53:51,000
Bless you.

998
00:53:52,460 --> 00:53:54,380
Goodnight.
- Goodnight, dear.

999
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:02,170
Finally, you found the time for me?

1000
00:54:02,750 --> 00:54:04,750
What can I do?
Uncle was being emotional.

1001
00:54:04,790 --> 00:54:06,290
What about my emotions?

1002
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:08,670
Anyway..

1003
00:54:11,380 --> 00:54:13,000
..I'm going to need this tonight.

1004
00:54:31,130 --> 00:54:32,000
Not tonight.

1005
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:34,670
Why?

1006
00:54:35,170 --> 00:54:38,710
Actually
I got menses today.

1007
00:54:40,750 --> 00:54:43,330
Madhuri,
Did you have to get it today?

1008
00:54:44,210 --> 00:54:47,040
Is it a courier service?
that it will call before coming..

1009
00:54:48,380 --> 00:54:48,830
Sorry.

1010
00:54:49,710 --> 00:54:50,420
But, what now?

1011
00:54:54,710 --> 00:54:55,290
Sure?

1012
00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:35,380
At least leave her lingerie behind.

1013
00:55:35,670 --> 00:55:38,500
What good is it to you?
- How dare she reject me?

1014
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:40,790
I feel like stripping
off the clothes she's wearing.

1015
00:55:40,830 --> 00:55:42,580
Let it be.
We've cleaned her out now.

1016
00:55:42,630 --> 00:55:43,500
Forgive her.

1017
00:55:47,630 --> 00:55:49,580
Hey, rascal!

1018
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:51,460
Drive properly.

1019
00:55:51,830 --> 00:55:53,460
You're spilling my liquor.

1020
00:55:54,250 --> 00:55:56,290
Dubeyji, why are you
speaking in Punjabi?

1021
00:55:57,460 --> 00:55:59,500
At least now get out of the character.

1022
00:55:59,540 --> 00:56:00,830
Look, truck is going!

1023
00:56:10,460 --> 00:56:11,710
What's the time?

1024
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:18,330
Madhuri, get me a cup of tea.

1025
00:56:25,380 --> 00:56:26,210
I said wake up.

1026
00:56:27,130 --> 00:56:29,880
Wake up!
- What's wrong?

1027
00:56:35,670 --> 00:56:36,710
Manjot!

1028
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:38,920
Manjot, wake up.

1029
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:40,250
Wake up.

1030
00:56:40,290 --> 00:56:41,420
Manjot.

1031
00:56:45,250 --> 00:56:46,210
Manjot.

1032
00:56:46,670 --> 00:56:47,500
Manjot.

1033
00:56:49,210 --> 00:56:50,460
Dimwit is sleeping in the shower.

1034
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:52,080
Manjot, wake up.

1035
00:56:52,790 --> 00:56:54,880
Wake up.
- Madhuri.

1036
00:56:55,670 --> 00:56:58,580
It's your mother.
Wake up.

1037
00:57:01,130 --> 00:57:02,040
We are robbed!

1038
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:05,130
Usually in the night, you get up
at least four times to pee.

1039
00:57:05,170 --> 00:57:06,330
But last night you kept sleeping.

1040
00:57:08,290 --> 00:57:09,670
She took everything.

1041
00:57:09,710 --> 00:57:13,830
She took my saris. Not just that,
she even took my lingerie.

1042
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:15,540
It wont even fit her!

1043
00:57:17,380 --> 00:57:19,880
Why didn't she take this?
Your broken watch!

1044
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:20,880
Why did she leave this?

1045
00:57:21,170 --> 00:57:24,250
Mom, I've cracked it. I've understood everything.
- What?

1046
00:57:24,290 --> 00:57:26,040
She must have eloped
with her so called uncle.

1047
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:26,790
What?

1048
00:57:27,170 --> 00:57:28,290
He must be her lover.

1049
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:30,080
What are you saying?

1050
00:57:30,750 --> 00:57:32,040
Eloped with her uncle.

1051
00:57:41,790 --> 00:57:43,000
What are you doing?

1052
00:57:43,790 --> 00:57:46,830
So, your complexion doesn't
show your age, right?

1053
00:57:47,830 --> 00:57:50,460
I'm going to beat you
black and blue.

1054
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:51,580
I don't know where Dolly is.

1055
00:57:51,630 --> 00:57:52,920
He won't admit so easily.

1056
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:56,170
He won't say a word
until the police gets here.

1057
00:57:56,210 --> 00:57:57,630
Call the police.

1058
00:57:57,670 --> 00:57:59,880
Fine, call the police.
- We don't need your permission.

1059
00:58:00,290 --> 00:58:01,670
Make the call.

1060
00:58:01,710 --> 00:58:03,170
Make yourself useful.

1061
00:58:03,710 --> 00:58:05,380
At least do something.
- Yes.

1062
00:58:05,420 --> 00:58:06,170
Listen to me.

1063
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:07,920
Shut up.

1064
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:09,580
Hello, Lajpat Nagar Police Station.

1065
00:58:09,630 --> 00:58:11,880
He's the thief, not you.
Don't be a wimp, speak louder.

1066
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:13,460
Hello, Lajpat Nagar Police Station!

1067
00:58:18,750 --> 00:58:20,210
How long have you been
working for Dolly's Gang?

1068
00:58:22,420 --> 00:58:23,580
I am not a member of any gang.

1069
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:25,500
I am a sugarcane farmer.

1070
00:58:26,330 --> 00:58:27,920
I just sold sugarcane worth 2 million.

1071
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:29,750
And I've even contested
the village court elections.

1072
00:58:30,250 --> 00:58:31,420
Don't take me lightly.

1073
00:58:34,170 --> 00:58:36,290
Disrespect your father.

1074
00:58:37,380 --> 00:58:39,540
But be respectful
when you talk to me.

1075
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:41,830
What?

1076
00:58:42,460 --> 00:58:43,130
Respect.

1077
00:58:43,750 --> 00:58:45,790
Sir, the boy's right.
He's a sugarcane farmer.

1078
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:47,830
What?

1079
00:58:48,250 --> 00:58:49,330
I am not her brother.

1080
00:58:50,130 --> 00:58:52,080
She's my wife, we got married.

1081
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:55,630
Sir, we've all his details.

1082
00:58:57,290 --> 00:58:59,670
He lives in Sonipat.
Name's Sonu Sehrawat.

1083
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:00,580
Sonu.

1084
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:03,880
They are sugarcane farmers.
Father's name Ramesh Sehrawat.

1085
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:07,000
He's not involved.

1086
00:59:13,830 --> 00:59:16,460
Yes.
- So, how was your wedding night.

1087
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:18,960
Rascal, don't make me angry
I'll call you later.

1088
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,580
Why? You couldn't satisfy
my sister in law?

1089
00:59:21,630 --> 00:59:24,380
Don't you get it?
She stole everything.

1090
00:59:24,420 --> 00:59:25,920
Didn't even let me touch her.

1091
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:28,420
It was an entire gang.
She's a thieving bride.

1092
00:59:28,460 --> 00:59:30,000
What?
- Don't call me again.

1093
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:31,380
I'm already messed up.

1094
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,830
We're getting breaking
news from Delhi's Lajpat Nagar..

1095
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:44,830
..and this will blow your mind away.

1096
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:46,630
Yes, Thieving Bride.

1097
00:59:46,670 --> 00:59:49,920
Last night,
she got married in a grand manner.

1098
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:52,420
... ransacked the entire family
before dawn, and disappeared

1099
00:59:52,460 --> 00:59:53,750
..with everything.

1100
00:59:53,790 --> 00:59:55,710
She traps in her web of love.

1101
00:59:55,750 --> 00:59:57,790
She swears to be
by your side, forever.

1102
00:59:57,830 --> 01:00:01,380
And then tarnishes all relations.

1103
01:00:01,420 --> 01:00:03,290
Don't be fooled by her innocent face.

1104
01:00:03,330 --> 01:00:06,750
There's a dangerous
thief hiding behind her.

1105
01:00:06,790 --> 01:00:08,790
Pretends to be Juhi or Vidya.

1106
01:00:08,830 --> 01:00:10,710
Sometimes Madhuri or Dolly.

1107
01:00:10,750 --> 01:00:15,290
This thieving bride can
approach you with any name.

1108
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,290
We'll be right back after this short break.

1109
01:00:18,330 --> 01:00:19,290
Stay tuned.

1110
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:27,880
If we would have all done our jobs
correctly at Manjot's wedding..

1111
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:29,080
..then, this would've never happened.

1112
01:00:29,670 --> 01:00:31,330
It's all over.

1113
01:00:31,790 --> 01:00:33,750
Our business is finished.

1114
01:00:35,380 --> 01:00:36,710
We're ruined.

1115
01:00:36,750 --> 01:00:39,670
You're not ruined,
I am the one ruined.

1116
01:00:40,290 --> 01:00:43,880
You can start all over again
with some new face. What about me?

1117
01:00:44,130 --> 01:00:46,630
My face is flashing on TV,
not yours.

1118
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:52,750
What's this now? Think about
how we'll get out of this situation.

1119
01:00:52,790 --> 01:00:54,750
There's nothing we can do.
It's all over.

1120
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:57,670
Dolly.

1121
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:02,420
You don't worry.

1122
01:01:03,170 --> 01:01:04,000
I am there.

1123
01:01:05,670 --> 01:01:06,880
We'll go and get married.

1124
01:01:08,420 --> 01:01:10,750
Shut up! Are you crazy?

1125
01:01:10,790 --> 01:01:12,250
Is that all you can think of?
Marriage!

1126
01:01:14,420 --> 01:01:16,170
The police are on their way here.

1127
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:18,250
They already caught the truck driver.

1128
01:01:18,290 --> 01:01:19,630
Hurry up.

1129
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:21,830
Imran's waiting at the
station with the tickets.

1130
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:22,830
Come on.

1131
01:01:42,540 --> 01:01:43,170
Sir!

1132
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:45,130
Come, come.

1133
01:01:45,170 --> 01:01:46,040
This way!

1134
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:53,830
Sir, Dolly's gang's most
senior and experienced member.

1135
01:01:54,380 --> 01:01:55,630
Now she's in our custody.

1136
01:02:02,170 --> 01:02:05,380
Have you made all arrangements in Udaipur?
- Yes.

1137
01:02:05,420 --> 01:02:08,420
Yes, I have a home there.
- That's good.

1138
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:11,710
What will we do in Udaipur?
- Nothing.

1139
01:02:11,750 --> 01:02:15,130
We'll lay low for some time. Okay?

1140
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,630
And as soon as things get normal..

1141
01:02:18,460 --> 01:02:20,380
..we'll do what we've been doing.
Right?

1142
01:02:22,210 --> 01:02:23,710
What else can we do?

1143
01:02:26,130 --> 01:02:28,130
If only we had some money?

1144
01:02:30,670 --> 01:02:32,880
We can get at least 1 Lakh
by selling these bangles given by raju.

1145
01:02:33,330 --> 01:02:34,460
Wow.

1146
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:36,750
No you won't.
- Why?

1147
01:02:36,790 --> 01:02:37,540
They are fake.

1148
01:02:39,170 --> 01:02:41,630
Loverboy's been giving fake gifts.

1149
01:02:44,420 --> 01:02:48,420
The bangles might be fake,
but his love's real.

1150
01:02:54,170 --> 01:02:57,210
Oh no, grandma!

1151
01:02:57,790 --> 01:02:59,130
Grandma!

1152
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:06,630
Tell me, where are your hideouts?

1153
01:03:07,710 --> 01:03:10,460
We've given you our daughter,
we've given you everything.

1154
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:16,960
Dumb, useless!

1155
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:20,040
Don't ruin your future.

1156
01:03:20,080 --> 01:03:22,540
I'm an expert at interrogation,
everyone cracks in front of me.

1157
01:03:22,580 --> 01:03:26,540
So where are your hideouts?

1158
01:03:27,170 --> 01:03:29,920
We've given you our daughter,
we've given you everything.

1159
01:03:36,540 --> 01:03:38,630
You know..

1160
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:42,380
Pastry. Have it.

1161
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:44,420
You haven't given everything!

1162
01:03:46,420 --> 01:03:47,170
Cheers.

1163
01:03:52,750 --> 01:03:55,080
Yes, you gave daughter
but to whom all?

1164
01:03:55,130 --> 01:03:57,920
We've given you our daughter,
we've given you everything

1165
01:03:57,960 --> 01:03:59,460
Shut up!

1166
01:04:00,460 --> 01:04:01,290
Enough!

1167
01:04:02,540 --> 01:04:03,250
Get lost!

1168
01:04:08,580 --> 01:04:09,210
Juice?

1169
01:04:10,750 --> 01:04:13,670
We've given you our daughter,
we've given you everything.

1170
01:04:16,170 --> 01:04:19,170
Now, if I don't get her daughter
and take everything.

1171
01:04:19,830 --> 01:04:22,080
I wont call myself Robin Singh.

1172
01:04:24,330 --> 01:04:25,210
Cheers.

1173
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:27,920
What for?

1174
01:04:31,670 --> 01:04:32,880
You're right.

1175
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:37,960
Astrologically we were perfect,
35 out 36 points matched!

1176
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:42,880
Yours too?
- Of course.

1177
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:45,880
Otherwise why would I
revolt against mom for her?

1178
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:49,880
Tell me something.

1179
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:53,290
Did she let you touch
her on your wedding night?

1180
01:04:56,790 --> 01:04:58,330
Why would I tell you that?

1181
01:04:59,710 --> 01:05:00,750
No, I just..
- What?

1182
01:05:01,250 --> 01:05:05,710
Did she say she got menses?
Did she let you touch her?

1183
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:07,540
Yes.

1184
01:05:12,670 --> 01:05:13,960
She let you do everything?

1185
01:05:25,630 --> 01:05:26,330
What happened then?

1186
01:05:26,830 --> 01:05:30,130
What else?
We made plans for our honeymoon.

1187
01:05:31,380 --> 01:05:35,630
Decided on the number of
kids we're going to have.

1188
01:05:37,880 --> 01:05:39,790
The bitch left me hanging in the middle.

1189
01:05:39,830 --> 01:05:40,750
Don't abuse her.

1190
01:05:46,460 --> 01:05:48,170
Why?
- I said don't.

1191
01:05:49,540 --> 01:05:50,540
Fine, I won't.

1192
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,630
Don't get furious.
I don't want to hurt you.

1193
01:05:56,790 --> 01:05:58,330
Can I ask you one last thing?

1194
01:06:03,040 --> 01:06:03,710
Go ahead.

1195
01:06:04,540 --> 01:06:05,920
But not about her?

1196
01:06:08,460 --> 01:06:10,710
What relation do we share?

1197
01:06:18,750 --> 01:06:20,420
I'll just be back from
the washroom.

1198
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:24,290
Get me another drink.

1199
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:30,330
- What's up?
- All good.

1200
01:06:30,380 --> 01:06:32,330
Pack 10 fritters and
half a kilo of sweets.

1201
01:06:35,710 --> 01:06:36,830
How's work going?

1202
01:06:37,420 --> 01:06:38,460
All okay.

1203
01:06:38,500 --> 01:06:40,250
Don't forget to pack
the red sauce as well.

1204
01:06:55,460 --> 01:06:57,290
His Highness is willing
to get his son married..

1205
01:06:57,330 --> 01:06:59,920
..without any dowry.
The ideal marriage.

1206
01:06:59,960 --> 01:07:02,000
He's brought the entire royal palace.

1207
01:07:03,250 --> 01:07:05,920
Prince Aditya.
His Highness' only son.

1208
01:07:05,960 --> 01:07:07,460
And he's just returned
from abroad 3 months ago.

1209
01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:10,630
That's great. Then he certainly
doesn't recognize Dolly.

1210
01:07:10,670 --> 01:07:13,000
Don't run on the first day.
- Okay.

1211
01:07:13,040 --> 01:07:15,790
First review everything.

1212
01:07:15,830 --> 01:07:17,210
And the day you get the key..

1213
01:07:17,250 --> 01:07:20,040
..disappear into thin air.
- Yes.

1214
01:07:20,540 --> 01:07:22,880
Don't forget about us once
you become a queen, Dolly.

1215
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:26,040
Mom, the only thing Dolly
forgets are her grooms.

1216
01:07:26,080 --> 01:07:27,460
Amazing.

1217
01:07:27,500 --> 01:07:30,210
I wish I was your real father.

1218
01:07:30,250 --> 01:07:33,170
So how does the Prince look?

1219
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:55,830
Greetings, Prince.

1220
01:07:55,880 --> 01:07:57,170
Greetings.

1221
01:07:57,210 --> 01:08:00,330
Prince, Meet my son Jagdish.

1222
01:08:00,380 --> 01:08:02,880
My wife, Ambika.

1223
01:08:02,920 --> 01:08:05,000
And this is my daughter, Bhagyashree.

1224
01:08:09,290 --> 01:08:11,380
- Take a seat, please.
- Thank you.

1225
01:08:13,580 --> 01:08:14,960
What an amazing family.

1226
01:08:15,330 --> 01:08:16,290
It's hard to believe..

1227
01:08:16,330 --> 01:08:19,670
..that Ambika and you are
Bhagyashree's parents.

1228
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:22,580
And Jagdish her brother.

1229
01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:26,080
Everyone has such different
complexion and features!

1230
01:08:26,540 --> 01:08:28,330
No one would be able to guess that
all of you are biologically related.

1231
01:08:30,750 --> 01:08:32,040
Well you can say that..

1232
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:35,710
..the Goddess has blessed
our family with singularity.

1233
01:08:36,290 --> 01:08:39,540
Amazing. By the way,
let me tell you one thing.

1234
01:08:39,580 --> 01:08:43,040
- Yes.
- There was a motive behind..

1235
01:08:43,080 --> 01:08:45,080
..the advertisement
which brought you all here.

1236
01:08:46,170 --> 01:08:47,630
What kind of motive, Prince?

1237
01:08:49,080 --> 01:08:52,460
Actually, my possible brother in law.

1238
01:08:52,500 --> 01:08:54,920
It's true that we don't want any dowry.

1239
01:08:55,670 --> 01:08:59,630
But the girl should also
accept me for who I am.

1240
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:01,130
Wholeheartedly.

1241
01:09:01,380 --> 01:09:04,290
You see I've decided
not to take anything from my Dad.

1242
01:09:04,580 --> 01:09:06,500
I want to do things on my own.

1243
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:08,330
Make a name for myself.

1244
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,380
Now, would you let your daughter..

1245
01:09:11,420 --> 01:09:13,000
..marry such a boy?

1246
01:09:17,750 --> 01:09:19,750
I have no objection.

1247
01:09:27,460 --> 01:09:31,830
So let me get this right,
You would like to marry someone..

1248
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:35,080
..who's technically still a prince,
but in reality, he's a Pauper.

1249
01:09:35,130 --> 01:09:39,710
I'll live like the way you do.
If we starve, we starve together.

1250
01:09:40,170 --> 01:09:42,710
If we eat, we eat together,
then I certainly will.

1251
01:09:45,830 --> 01:09:48,500
She passed the exam
with flying colors, manager.

1252
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:51,080
I like the girl.

1253
01:09:51,880 --> 01:09:53,210
Do you have any more exams?

1254
01:09:53,250 --> 01:09:56,080
Yes, just a small test.

1255
01:09:56,710 --> 01:09:58,170
But first there's a surprise for you.

1256
01:10:53,460 --> 01:10:54,710
Arrest them all.

1257
01:10:58,830 --> 01:10:59,500
Move!

1258
01:11:00,580 --> 01:11:01,250
Let's go!

1259
01:11:04,830 --> 01:11:07,380
I wish you were like you said you are.

1260
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:09,290
And I swear I would..

1261
01:11:12,380 --> 01:11:15,500
Anyway take her away,
but be gentle.

1262
01:11:15,540 --> 01:11:16,250
Yes sir. Okay sir.

1263
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:21,330
Put her in my car.
- Yes.

1264
01:11:21,380 --> 01:11:23,040
We'll begin her
interrogation right away.

1265
01:11:23,330 --> 01:11:24,040
Okay sir.

1266
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:28,920
Thank you, your Highness.

1267
01:11:30,290 --> 01:11:32,330
Now you can get married peacefully.

1268
01:11:32,380 --> 01:11:33,170
I have a question.

1269
01:11:33,880 --> 01:11:35,960
How did you know
they would come here?

1270
01:11:36,250 --> 01:11:40,170
Prince, a bad penny always turns up.

1271
01:11:42,250 --> 01:11:44,580
Are you sure,
she's the same girl?

1272
01:11:45,210 --> 01:11:48,630
Did you mistakenly..
- Your highness..

1273
01:11:48,670 --> 01:11:50,380
..you're bowled over by her too.

1274
01:11:50,790 --> 01:11:51,750
No.

1275
01:11:54,880 --> 01:11:56,420
I am clean bowled!

1276
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:20,960
"My heart finds no comfort
in prayers or devotion."

1277
01:12:21,880 --> 01:12:27,540
"These days my heart
wants to revolt."

1278
01:12:34,830 --> 01:12:40,920
"My heart finds no comfort
in prayers or devotion."

1279
01:12:41,630 --> 01:12:47,500
"These days my heart wants to revolt."

1280
01:12:48,250 --> 01:12:51,500
"You're the reason.."

1281
01:12:51,540 --> 01:12:53,880
"You're the reason.."

1282
01:12:54,630 --> 01:13:00,580
"..I've turned against my own God."

1283
01:13:03,210 --> 01:13:09,170
"My eyes have become infidels."

1284
01:13:09,790 --> 01:13:15,000
"They've been travelling in your lane."

1285
01:13:16,250 --> 01:13:22,420
"My eyes have become infidels."

1286
01:13:22,920 --> 01:13:27,920
"They've been travelling in your lane."

1287
01:13:53,290 --> 01:13:58,170
"When I close my eyes."

1288
01:13:59,830 --> 01:14:05,130
"I dream only about you."

1289
01:14:07,170 --> 01:14:13,540
"Now that I have you."

1290
01:14:13,580 --> 01:14:19,290
"Where do I go leaving you alone."

1291
01:14:20,250 --> 01:14:22,920
"You're the reason.."

1292
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:25,960
"You're the reason..."

1293
01:14:26,790 --> 01:14:32,880
"...I've turned against my own God."

1294
01:14:34,790 --> 01:14:41,830
"My eyes have become infidels."

1295
01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:46,750
"They've been travelling in your lane."

1296
01:14:48,420 --> 01:14:54,330
"My eyes have become infidels."

1297
01:14:54,830 --> 01:15:01,460
"They've been travelling in your lane."

1298
01:15:33,670 --> 01:15:34,830
What have you turned into?

1299
01:15:35,880 --> 01:15:37,920
You don't have the
right to ask me anything.

1300
01:15:37,960 --> 01:15:39,460
You're doing such a splendid job.

1301
01:15:40,210 --> 01:15:41,790
Couldn't you find anything more lowly?

1302
01:15:41,830 --> 01:15:43,790
If these people hadn't found me..

1303
01:15:43,830 --> 01:15:45,790
..then, I would be pimping myself..
- I'll slap you.

1304
01:15:45,830 --> 01:15:47,460
Screaming doesn't
make you a real man.

1305
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:49,830
If you were a real man,
you would've showed up that day.

1306
01:15:49,880 --> 01:15:50,790
I couldn't.

1307
01:15:53,290 --> 01:15:55,380
It was all about a moment,
I couldn't gather the courage.

1308
01:15:56,750 --> 01:15:58,380
When my father stopped me..

1309
01:15:58,420 --> 01:16:00,750
..I realized that running
away with you and getting married..

1310
01:16:00,790 --> 01:16:02,040
..was a huge decision.

1311
01:16:02,710 --> 01:16:04,500
And I was too young.

1312
01:16:04,540 --> 01:16:06,420
And I am still punishing myself for it.

1313
01:16:07,960 --> 01:16:09,830
When my father died,
I didn't perform his last rites.

1314
01:16:09,880 --> 01:16:10,920
Are you done?

1315
01:16:44,210 --> 01:16:46,130
Go tell him.
-I wont, you say it.

1316
01:16:46,170 --> 01:16:47,670
Say it, you're young.

1317
01:16:47,710 --> 01:16:48,750
Say it.

1318
01:16:48,790 --> 01:16:51,040
Say it.
- Shall I?

1319
01:16:55,580 --> 01:16:56,790
Sir.
- Sir..

1320
01:16:56,830 --> 01:16:59,330
Just a minute,
there's something we want to say.

1321
01:16:59,380 --> 01:17:00,330
Sir please.

1322
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:02,210
Oh. he is coming

1323
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:06,670
Yes.

1324
01:17:08,250 --> 01:17:10,130
We haven't done anything wrong.

1325
01:17:10,750 --> 01:17:14,540
She herself trap the grooms,
and drug their milk glasses.

1326
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:16,500
And she would steal the stuff as well.

1327
01:17:16,540 --> 01:17:19,170
We would get only a small share.

1328
01:17:19,710 --> 01:17:21,000
Yes.
- Speak up.

1329
01:17:21,040 --> 01:17:22,670
He's right, sir.

1330
01:17:22,710 --> 01:17:25,130
She's behind all the loot.

1331
01:17:29,080 --> 01:17:30,250
This is your family.

1332
01:17:32,290 --> 01:17:33,380
They are right.

1333
01:17:34,170 --> 01:17:35,420
I did everything.

1334
01:17:36,130 --> 01:17:37,500
It's all my fault.

1335
01:17:38,130 --> 01:17:39,380
I trapped the grooms.

1336
01:17:40,380 --> 01:17:41,830
I married them.

1337
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:44,710
In fact, I'm the one
who stole all the stuff.

1338
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:47,000
They were just a spectators.

1339
01:17:48,420 --> 01:17:49,500
Let them go.

1340
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:54,040
See..

1341
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:57,000
Honestly, sir.

1342
01:17:58,540 --> 01:18:00,040
Sir..
Just a minute.

1343
01:18:01,290 --> 01:18:02,790
He's just..

1344
01:18:02,830 --> 01:18:04,330
That constable is amazing.

1345
01:18:07,500 --> 01:18:08,580
Sir, I have a question.

1346
01:18:11,380 --> 01:18:12,420
Go ahead, Mr. Khan.

1347
01:18:13,670 --> 01:18:16,380
Sir, they are all involved
in the conspiracy.

1348
01:18:17,460 --> 01:18:20,460
How let go?
I Don't know.

1349
01:18:23,380 --> 01:18:27,710
Mr. Khan, when the main culprit
says they're not involved..

1350
01:18:28,460 --> 01:18:29,880
..then, we cannot charge
them with anything.

1351
01:18:30,830 --> 01:18:31,630
Let them go.

1352
01:18:32,830 --> 01:18:33,790
Let them go?

1353
01:18:37,380 --> 01:18:38,330
Release them.

1354
01:18:47,290 --> 01:18:48,750
Raju, come here.

1355
01:18:49,630 --> 01:18:50,920
What?
- Come here.

1356
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:02,290
These are fake like you.

1357
01:19:14,580 --> 01:19:15,630
Listen.

1358
01:19:16,380 --> 01:19:20,170
If you want your faces intact..

1359
01:19:20,540 --> 01:19:22,750
..then don't show them again.

1360
01:19:23,170 --> 01:19:25,130
Understand?
Leave.

1361
01:19:25,830 --> 01:19:28,830
And take grandma
from the old age home.

1362
01:19:29,080 --> 01:19:31,960
She's still repeating
her lines out there.

1363
01:19:41,670 --> 01:19:42,920
Madam will you sign the confession?

1364
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:44,880
Sign.

1365
01:19:51,250 --> 01:19:54,420
Do you meet your mom
and dad?

1366
01:19:58,040 --> 01:19:59,540
You two know each other?

1367
01:20:01,830 --> 01:20:02,830
What did you think?

1368
01:20:03,790 --> 01:20:06,040
That I was working hard
for upholding law and order?

1369
01:20:06,080 --> 01:20:07,670
But she screwed me.

1370
01:20:08,080 --> 01:20:10,500
She screwed me of my money
and my honor.

1371
01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:12,420
It's not about money or honor.

1372
01:20:13,830 --> 01:20:15,330
We loved her and she betrayed us.

1373
01:20:15,380 --> 01:20:17,500
And I fought with my mom for this girl.

1374
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:19,790
And I rejected Arora uncle's daughter..

1375
01:20:19,830 --> 01:20:21,000
Stop whining!

1376
01:20:21,580 --> 01:20:26,040
Look, she'll be punished
for her deeds.

1377
01:20:26,080 --> 01:20:26,920
Yeah, like that's right.

1378
01:20:27,250 --> 01:20:28,080
Really?

1379
01:20:29,420 --> 01:20:31,750
That's all cheap girls
like you can ever do.

1380
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,210
Right, I am cheap.

1381
01:20:35,250 --> 01:20:36,920
And you're nice and decent!

1382
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:40,420
People like you think,
you've got the money and position..

1383
01:20:40,460 --> 01:20:44,210
..and all the girls in
the world will fall for you.

1384
01:20:45,170 --> 01:20:47,880
I never felt guilty leaving anyone of you.

1385
01:20:48,920 --> 01:20:50,250
I feel more liberated in this jail..

1386
01:20:50,290 --> 01:20:52,460
..compared to suffocation of marrying
any one of you.

1387
01:20:57,040 --> 01:21:00,130
Mr. Khan, recover their
goods and get them out of here.

1388
01:21:03,580 --> 01:21:04,710
Come.

1389
01:21:12,170 --> 01:21:13,250
Look..

1390
01:21:16,290 --> 01:21:17,420
I understand everything.

1391
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:20,210
You're Dolly's first lover.

1392
01:21:21,540 --> 01:21:22,250
Right?

1393
01:21:23,130 --> 01:21:26,380
You betrayed her,
and we're paying the price.

1394
01:21:27,710 --> 01:21:33,130
And I can screw you bad
for what you did to Dolly.

1395
01:21:33,500 --> 01:21:34,790
And no one can do a thing.

1396
01:21:35,630 --> 01:21:36,500
Understand.

1397
01:21:39,880 --> 01:21:42,920
Look,
you've a second opportunity.

1398
01:21:43,880 --> 01:21:45,000
Mend your mistakes.

1399
01:21:46,380 --> 01:21:47,630
She's a nice girl.

1400
01:21:55,880 --> 01:21:57,130
Now listen to this..

1401
01:22:01,960 --> 01:22:05,710
Listen, I don't just want my stuff.

1402
01:22:06,710 --> 01:22:08,380
Really? What else?

1403
01:22:08,420 --> 01:22:10,040
I want Dolly as well.

1404
01:22:11,460 --> 01:22:12,500
You want Dolly.

1405
01:22:14,460 --> 01:22:16,830
My right, I want it now!

1406
01:22:17,130 --> 01:22:18,040
Okay.

1407
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:21,380
And stop staring.

1408
01:22:21,420 --> 01:22:23,420
My distant uncle is
the ACP in Delhi Police.

1409
01:22:23,460 --> 01:22:25,040
Shall I call him?
- No.

1410
01:22:26,960 --> 01:22:28,380
We'll get you Dolly.

1411
01:22:29,500 --> 01:22:30,250
Come on.

1412
01:22:33,540 --> 01:22:34,290
Come on.

1413
01:22:34,960 --> 01:22:36,330
We'll get you Dolly.

1414
01:22:43,670 --> 01:22:45,380
He really beat me black and blue.

1415
01:22:47,880 --> 01:22:51,540
Damn! Because of her
we got beaten up, ransacked.

1416
01:22:52,750 --> 01:22:55,960
But had Dolly let me do her once..

1417
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,670
..then, I would've had no regrets.

1418
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:05,330
What's wrong?

1419
01:23:05,380 --> 01:23:08,500
Are you crazy?
What's wrong?

1420
01:23:34,130 --> 01:23:35,250
Hey!

1421
01:23:37,210 --> 01:23:39,330
- Where is Dolly?
- You were sleeping while on duty?

1422
01:23:51,210 --> 01:23:52,000
Yes, madam.

1423
01:23:52,040 --> 01:23:53,000
Any information on Dolly.

1424
01:23:53,380 --> 01:23:55,040
We're still conducting
a search operation.

1425
01:23:55,080 --> 01:23:57,000
Clues indicate that she fled to Nepal.

1426
01:23:57,040 --> 01:23:58,330
Find her soon.

1427
01:23:58,380 --> 01:24:00,130
The entire department feels humiliated.

1428
01:24:00,460 --> 01:24:04,210
And listen, I want a complete
investigation report of that girl.

1429
01:24:04,670 --> 01:24:05,420
Yes.

1430
01:24:07,080 --> 01:24:07,880
Jai Hind, madam.

1431
01:24:16,330 --> 01:24:18,330
Sorry, we're late.

1432
01:24:19,330 --> 01:24:20,710
Do you two want to get married?

1433
01:24:21,710 --> 01:24:22,420
Yes.
- Yes.

1434
01:24:23,330 --> 01:24:24,920
Your name?
- Dolly.

1435
01:24:26,420 --> 01:24:28,380
Priya.
- It's my pet name.

1436
01:24:31,130 --> 01:24:32,330
This is her ID.

1437
01:24:33,290 --> 01:24:36,040
Is that sufficient,
or do you need her voter ID, passport?

1438
01:24:36,080 --> 01:24:38,830
No, this is enough.
Here.

1439
01:24:39,420 --> 01:24:41,920
And sign here.

1440
01:24:45,170 --> 01:24:47,250
Witness?
- Me.

1441
01:24:48,750 --> 01:24:50,380
Are you two related?

1442
01:24:50,420 --> 01:24:51,380
Shall we get it tested?

1443
01:24:51,420 --> 01:24:52,670
No, that's fine!

1444
01:24:55,460 --> 01:24:56,380
And your witness?

1445
01:24:58,130 --> 01:25:00,000
Well, I've no one.

1446
01:25:00,670 --> 01:25:02,000
So no witness.

1447
01:25:11,080 --> 01:25:12,250
Good.

1448
01:25:14,830 --> 01:25:17,170
Congratulations.
- Thank you.

1449
01:25:17,210 --> 01:25:18,380
- You too.
- Thank you.

1450
01:25:20,080 --> 01:25:22,290
Congratulations.
- Thank you.

1451
01:25:22,330 --> 01:25:23,080
Just a second.

1452
01:25:24,830 --> 01:25:25,630
Thank you.

1453
01:25:27,670 --> 01:25:28,420
Welcome.

1454
01:25:29,130 --> 01:25:29,920
How's everyone.

1455
01:25:32,750 --> 01:25:33,710
I've a gift for you.

1456
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:37,210
Mr. Khan, there was
no need for this.

1457
01:25:37,250 --> 01:25:38,250
Take it.

1458
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,250
Guess you got a raise.
- No, it's not that.

1459
01:25:48,540 --> 01:25:50,290
What the..

1460
01:25:50,330 --> 01:25:51,000
Softly.

1461
01:25:51,790 --> 01:25:54,460
If anyone overhears,
my job will be at stake.

1462
01:25:54,750 --> 01:25:57,130
You brought the entire file.

1463
01:25:57,170 --> 01:26:01,710
I devoted years of
my life to Delhi Police.

1464
01:26:01,750 --> 01:26:03,330
So I'm bound to get something back.

1465
01:26:03,630 --> 01:26:04,630
Am I right?

1466
01:26:04,880 --> 01:26:05,920
I am sorry, Dolly.

1467
01:26:07,630 --> 01:26:08,710
I don't know what I was thinking.

1468
01:26:10,920 --> 01:26:12,040
In my stubbornness
to be close to you..

1469
01:26:13,670 --> 01:26:15,170
..I never took a good
look at myself.

1470
01:26:17,540 --> 01:26:18,710
He's the right one for you.

1471
01:26:21,130 --> 01:26:23,460
Finally you fulfilled your
responsibilities as her brother.

1472
01:26:24,330 --> 01:26:26,330
Oh I forgot, I got a gift for you.

1473
01:26:30,920 --> 01:26:32,210
Shall we go, Mrs. Robin Singh?

1474
01:26:49,380 --> 01:26:52,210
Good morning.
- Good morning.

1475
01:26:54,130 --> 01:26:56,040
What's the plan for today?
- Plan.

1476
01:26:57,170 --> 01:26:59,630
Well, my plan was
to head to the Police station.

1477
01:27:00,670 --> 01:27:02,540
But I can take an off if you want.

1478
01:27:02,920 --> 01:27:04,380
And our honeymoon plans?

1479
01:27:05,130 --> 01:27:05,920
Honeymoon?

1480
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:08,630
We'll have to head somewhere..

1481
01:27:08,670 --> 01:27:10,080
..where we don't run
into one of your grooms.

1482
01:27:11,580 --> 01:27:13,080
Then we'll have to go abroad.

1483
01:27:14,630 --> 01:27:16,830
I don't think I've married an Italian yet.

1484
01:27:17,630 --> 01:27:19,500
I see..
Italian?

1485
01:27:21,500 --> 01:27:23,880
Let's do one thing.

1486
01:27:24,630 --> 01:27:26,790
There's brinjal in the fridge.
- I see.

1487
01:27:26,830 --> 01:27:29,460
Make really good Italian
style brinjal-mash.

1488
01:27:30,080 --> 01:27:31,630
I'll take you to Italy if I like it.

1489
01:27:31,960 --> 01:27:33,420
I can't cook.

1490
01:27:36,580 --> 01:27:38,170
I'll make it myself.

1491
01:27:46,790 --> 01:27:49,790
Dolly. Hand me my towel.

1492
01:27:52,670 --> 01:27:53,250
Dolly.

1493
01:27:57,420 --> 01:27:58,130
Dolly!

1494
01:27:59,920 --> 01:28:01,000
Coming.

1495
01:28:02,290 --> 01:28:03,580
Don't shout.

1496
01:28:05,630 --> 01:28:07,580
Did you finish making
The Italian-mash?

1497
01:28:08,290 --> 01:28:10,830
Hurry up,
or you'll be late for work.

1498
01:28:16,420 --> 01:28:17,790
Dolly.

1499
01:28:18,630 --> 01:28:21,250
The Prince of Udaipur
has invited us to his wedding.

1500
01:28:24,500 --> 01:28:25,460
Shall we?

1501
01:28:28,130 --> 01:28:29,500
He helped us after all.

1502
01:28:30,830 --> 01:28:31,710
Dolly.

1503
01:28:52,880 --> 01:28:55,170
"Dear Robin, I'm sorry."

1504
01:28:55,210 --> 01:28:57,670
"I made lentil instead."

1505
01:28:57,710 --> 01:29:02,460
"And anyway, I can make
a mash of grooms, not brinjal."

1506
01:29:03,130 --> 01:29:06,830
"When you caught me,
you asked why I do this."

1507
01:29:07,460 --> 01:29:10,750
"Every groom I ever
left has asked the same question."

1508
01:29:11,080 --> 01:29:12,040
"I have a question too."

1509
01:29:12,420 --> 01:29:13,880
"Why are you a police inspector?"

1510
01:29:14,170 --> 01:29:15,670
"Why not some doctor or engineer?"

1511
01:29:16,130 --> 01:29:18,170
"Why does a vegetable
vendor sell only vegetables?"

1512
01:29:18,500 --> 01:29:19,960
"Why doesn't he also sell liquor?"

1513
01:29:20,290 --> 01:29:23,380
"Actually,
they do what they're good at."

1514
01:29:23,920 --> 01:29:26,170
"They are what they're meant to be."

1515
01:29:26,790 --> 01:29:29,750
"So don't feel guilty
that I'm this way."

1516
01:29:29,790 --> 01:29:33,040
"You're neither the reason
nor the excuse in my life."

1517
01:29:33,790 --> 01:29:35,830
"Dolly might have been
an innocent and naive girl."

1518
01:29:36,210 --> 01:29:37,540
"But she's an express now."

1519
01:29:38,750 --> 01:29:42,580
"Dolly Express has caught speed,
She cannot be stopped."

1520
01:29:43,210 --> 01:29:44,710
"You don't try it either."

1521
01:29:45,130 --> 01:29:48,000
"And yes, The scores' settled."

1522
01:29:53,210 --> 01:29:54,080
Sister.

1523
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:05,880
Madam, ticket please.

1524
01:31:17,710 --> 01:31:18,500
Thank you, ma'am.

1525
01:31:27,290 --> 01:31:30,040
So, why are we heading to Chennai,
instead of Mumbai?

1526
01:31:30,460 --> 01:31:32,420
What's so special about Mumbai?

1527
01:31:34,580 --> 01:31:37,330
India's most eligible bachelor.

1528
01:31:37,380 --> 01:31:38,080
Salman brother.

1529
01:31:38,330 --> 01:31:39,790
Hey, he might be your brother.

1530
01:31:40,130 --> 01:31:42,460
He's my loverboy.
Right, grandma?

1531
01:31:43,420 --> 01:31:46,210
We've given you our daughter,
we've given you everything

1532
01:32:00,040 --> 01:32:02,500
- You drink milk?
- Yes, with Turmeric.

1533
01:32:15,630 --> 01:32:19,000
"Let me tell you today, dear."

1534
01:32:19,040 --> 01:32:22,330
"My love's not a bully."

1535
01:32:25,880 --> 01:32:29,210
"How long do I keep
circling your lanes?"

1536
01:32:29,250 --> 01:32:32,830
"I'm getting no response."

1537
01:32:33,880 --> 01:32:35,080
"All day.."

1538
01:32:35,540 --> 01:32:36,960
"All day.."

1539
01:32:37,250 --> 01:32:40,580
"All day I follow you like a puppy."

1540
01:32:40,630 --> 01:32:45,630
"At nights I rot like an owl."

1541
01:32:45,880 --> 01:32:49,830
"What did I get for loving you.."

1542
01:32:49,880 --> 01:32:51,710
"Nothing at all."

1543
01:32:52,710 --> 01:32:56,710
"What did I get for loving you.."

1544
01:32:56,750 --> 01:32:58,630
"Nothing at all."

1545
01:33:00,040 --> 01:33:02,040
"Nothing at all."

1546
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:03,500
"Nothing at all."

1547
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:05,420
"Nothing at all."

1548
01:33:05,460 --> 01:33:06,750
"Nothing at all."

1549
01:33:06,790 --> 01:33:10,630
"What did I get for loving you.."

1550
01:33:10,670 --> 01:33:12,290
"Nothing at all."

1551
01:33:17,290 --> 01:33:20,380
"Never replies to my text message."

1552
01:33:20,420 --> 01:33:23,920
"Guess she's sitting
next to my younger brother."

1553
01:33:23,960 --> 01:33:27,170
"I squandered all my money on you."

1554
01:33:27,210 --> 01:33:30,790
"And my mom and dad screwed me too.

1555
01:33:30,830 --> 01:33:34,080
"I scream and say that I love you."

1556
01:33:34,130 --> 01:33:37,670
"But you've turned deaf
and can't hear a word."

1557
01:33:46,500 --> 01:33:49,830
"Our heart's really mischievous."

1558
01:33:49,880 --> 01:33:53,460
"Darling, you're such
a cheat as well."

1559
01:33:53,500 --> 01:33:56,630
"Your red cheeks.."

1560
01:33:56,670 --> 01:34:00,290
"..has completely changed my life."

1561
01:34:00,330 --> 01:34:03,580
"I keep chanting your name all day."

1562
01:34:03,630 --> 01:34:07,170
"Should I sing or chant."

1563
01:34:08,210 --> 01:34:09,790
"Hi, hello.."

1564
01:34:10,170 --> 01:34:11,540
"Hi, hello.."

1565
01:34:11,790 --> 01:34:15,130
"You say hi, hello to strangers."

1566
01:34:15,170 --> 01:34:19,170
"While we've been standing
behind you all day."

1567
01:34:20,210 --> 01:34:24,250
"What did I get for loving you.."

1568
01:34:24,290 --> 01:34:26,710
"Nothing at all."

1569
01:34:30,580 --> 01:34:34,460
"What did I get for loving you.."

1570
01:34:34,500 --> 01:34:36,790
"Nothing at all."

1571
01:34:37,630 --> 01:34:39,670
"Nothing at all."

1572
01:34:39,710 --> 01:34:41,630
"Nothing at all."

1573
01:34:41,670 --> 01:34:43,040
"Nothing at all."

1574
01:34:43,080 --> 01:34:44,380
"Nothing at all."

1575
01:34:44,420 --> 01:34:48,170
"What did I get for loving you.."

1576
01:34:48,210 --> 01:34:50,130
"Nothing at all."
