00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:35,791
Hi, my name is Anbirkiniyal

2
00:01:35,833 --> 00:01:37,500
I am 25 years old

3
00:01:37,528 --> 00:01:39,859
I live with my father

4
00:01:39,892 --> 00:01:41,268
I am nursing...acho!

5
00:01:42,749 --> 00:01:44,915
I am BSc, nursing...no

6
00:01:46,292 --> 00:01:49,333
I am a BSC nursing graduate

7
00:01:50,958 --> 00:01:52,542
Something is missing here-

8
00:01:56,458 --> 00:02:01,208
"Like a king with his elephantry"

9
00:02:03,709 --> 00:02:10,958
"Like a king with his mighty elephantry
you represent present day history"

10
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:18,179
"Pearl so rare, a sparkling future
you can foresee for sure"

11
00:02:18,231 --> 00:02:24,813
"Light of my home, if by my side forever
peace of mind I will cherish and savor"

12
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:32,625
"Even if I die for your sake duly
please comply to forsake me"

13
00:02:32,709 --> 00:02:40,000
"I saw you yesterday in the sky
as a cluster of nimbus clouds sailing by"

14
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:47,208
"You are the fresh flower of tomorrow
this earth will sprout to blossom also"

15
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:54,625
"My dream-come-true!
In my eyes I shall carry you"

16
00:02:54,667 --> 00:03:01,916
"My heartbeat, my Godsend
I will protect you till the very end"

17
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:08,667
"Like a king with his mighty elephantry
you represent  present day history"

18
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:15,791
"Pearl so rare, a sparkling future
you can witness for sure"

19
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:22,458
Appa...?

20
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:41,833
"The warmth of your tender hand in mine
I want my palms to retain for a lifetime"

21
00:03:41,916 --> 00:03:49,125
"The sky will oblige crystal clear
rain showers for you to shower, dear"

22
00:03:49,184 --> 00:03:56,101
"The imprint of your feet I favor
The design they draw I savor"

23
00:03:56,458 --> 00:04:03,250
"Path should be etched fully
with your footprint only"

24
00:04:03,292 --> 00:04:08,250
"To ensure you don't hurt your finger"

25
00:04:08,292 --> 00:04:12,208
"When you light a lamp, dear
beside you I will linger"

26
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:17,250
"I will nurse you back to health so well"

27
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:21,417
"Much better than even your mother will"

28
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:26,083
"I came here, dear daughter
as your life, love and laughter"

29
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:31,292
"I sprinkled gold dust on you, my precious
Apple of my eye, close your eyes and rest"

30
00:04:49,542 --> 00:04:51,833
'The work I am starting today
and others that will follow'

31
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:54,702
'O' pure gem, Lord Ganesha
along with Your brother Lord Muruga'

32
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:57,041
'Please consider my work as Yours'

33
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:59,625
'O' Lord with a golden belly,
may I succeed without any hitch'

34
00:04:59,667 --> 00:05:02,375
'Praise be to Thee, the God
who protects us against all hurdles'

35
00:05:03,628 --> 00:05:05,751
I must somehow ace it
in my English exam today

36
00:05:07,292 --> 00:05:09,041
Tea is in the table

37
00:05:11,292 --> 00:05:13,000
'In' means inside

38
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:14,750
How can tea be inside the table?

39
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:18,041
'It isn't 'in' the table, dear
Right usage is 'on' the table'

40
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:19,542
Aiyo! Aunty

41
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:22,166
How do you know I'm attending
a 'Speak fluent English' course?

42
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:25,790
'The whole world knows! That tea hasn't
crossed the table for the past 40 days!'

43
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:28,022
Appa, stop cracking your poor jokes, okay?

44
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:30,166
Thinks he educated me
in Oxford University

45
00:05:30,208 --> 00:05:31,709
You admitted me
in a Govt school

46
00:05:31,749 --> 00:05:33,625
That too, Tamil medium
My fluency will be limited

47
00:05:33,663 --> 00:05:36,292
'Our Abdul Kalam studied
 in the same Govt school'

48
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:38,750
'He became a scientist and
then the President of our nation'

49
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:43,790
'Sivan, chief of ISRO and Sagayam, IAS
are all alumni of Govt school'

50
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:45,125
'You should also be like them-'

51
00:05:45,156 --> 00:05:47,156
All that is fine
First come out of the loo

52
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:48,250
Then, appa

53
00:05:48,292 --> 00:05:50,083
Tea is ON the table, okay?

54
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:51,208
'Okay, go'

55
00:05:51,406 --> 00:05:52,364
Yes

56
00:05:52,417 --> 00:05:53,542
[coughing]

57
00:05:57,624 --> 00:06:00,165
Appa, are you smoking in there?

58
00:06:00,417 --> 00:06:01,583
'Of course not'

59
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:02,916
Don't you dare lie to me

60
00:06:02,958 --> 00:06:04,667
'Doubting my words, rascal!'

61
00:06:04,709 --> 00:06:05,790
Yes, very true

62
00:06:05,829 --> 00:06:06,913
Come out now

63
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:10,125
I know you have flushed the cigarette

64
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:12,500
How many times I've shown you
videos on YouTube?

65
00:06:12,542 --> 00:06:14,542
For you to know
the ill effects of smoking!

66
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:16,790
I know, my dear

67
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:20,958
'Your lungs are like cotton'

68
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,292
'If not taken care of in the proper manner
you will be prone to terrible disease-'

69
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:27,916
You realize that, don't you?

70
00:06:28,458 --> 00:06:31,375
I get it but I don't know where I kept it

71
00:06:32,301 --> 00:06:35,009
What a hotshot message
that blessed chap has forwarded

72
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:37,333
Wait, dear, I have to
forward this right away

73
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:38,750
Forward it to my group

74
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:42,250
How many times should I tell you not to
 forward these forwarded messages?

75
00:06:42,292 --> 00:06:44,417
Our group will be on fire today!

76
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:48,041
I'll remove you from all the groups
when you are asleep tonight

77
00:06:48,109 --> 00:06:52,317
But don't unsubscribe me
from the '60's kids' group please!

78
00:06:55,667 --> 00:06:57,417
You're getting ready in 5 minutes

79
00:06:58,957 --> 00:07:00,666
Wow! So coool, man

80
00:07:00,735 --> 00:07:01,735
Coming

81
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:04,958
Our Govt says yes to public exams
and then cancels them

82
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,483
It's all a mystery, right?

83
00:07:06,542 --> 00:07:07,625
Forget it

84
00:07:07,667 --> 00:07:08,791
Forget all about it

85
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:10,250
We'll cross the bridge later!

86
00:07:10,292 --> 00:07:11,458
Hey!!

87
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:13,916
Hey 'lovekiniyal', love you

88
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:15,417
- Hit you
- Escape!!

89
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:17,583
Hi, akka
Good morning

90
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:19,916
You are shining brighter than
 the fullmoon, akka

91
00:07:19,958 --> 00:07:21,625
Did you scrub your face
with orange peel?

92
00:07:21,667 --> 00:07:24,125
We'll upload your picture in FB
You'll get 'likes' sky-high

93
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:26,041
Chee! Get the trash now

94
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:28,749
I made rice flakes 'upma' for both of you

95
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:29,791
Okay?
Bye

96
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:30,874
'Fresh vegetables'

97
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,417
Hi uncle
Hi aunty

98
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:35,187
Come, Anbu
Join us for breakfast

99
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:37,208
It's okay, aunty
I've already eaten

100
00:07:37,292 --> 00:07:39,417
Hello, Mr Raghavan
Full steam, huh?

101
00:07:39,476 --> 00:07:41,434
It's all organic, ma
Nothing to go gaga over

102
00:07:43,136 --> 00:07:45,083
Hey Insta! What's your video for today?

103
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:46,958
Akka, don't announce it so loudly

104
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:53,292
- Anbu
- Yes, uncle

105
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:55,583
Tell me if my mother's tablets
need to be ordered again

106
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:56,709
Yes, uncle

107
00:08:00,187 --> 00:08:03,160
If you don't wear your slippers
how will you be cured of arthritis?

108
00:08:03,192 --> 00:08:04,359
Back like a bad penny, huh?

109
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:05,833
As soon as the clock strikes 9

110
00:08:05,884 --> 00:08:08,968
...thinking of you, my heart
starts beating 10 times faster

111
00:08:09,017 --> 00:08:11,268
If you come 5 minutes late
1 day, what will-

112
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:15,041
What will happen is a silly thought
And so just zip your lips

113
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:17,417
Aaaah...ouch!

114
00:08:18,067 --> 00:08:19,817
I haven't even injected you

115
00:08:20,916 --> 00:08:22,041
Not yet, huh?

116
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:23,833
Go ahead...be gentle

117
00:08:23,874 --> 00:08:28,000
After giving birth to 5 sons, you are
 bringing the roof down for 1 injection!

118
00:08:28,067 --> 00:08:29,192
Gentle...ouch!

119
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:30,409
Over...over

120
00:08:32,417 --> 00:08:36,000
Why don't you sit next to this grandma
for 5 minutes, chat and then breeze out?

121
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:38,160
Don't have the time to chit-chat
What is it? Tell me

122
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:40,000
Why do you have wheels on your feet?

123
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:41,583
Razo is over, huh?

124
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:42,916
Come to the point

125
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,750
Your father came here yesterday

126
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:48,041
Listen, don't start a tirade
against my dad

127
00:08:48,078 --> 00:08:51,129
He doesn't like you going
to Canada one bit it seems

128
00:08:51,171 --> 00:08:52,379
I don't like it either

129
00:08:52,433 --> 00:08:54,667
Have you seen the board
outside my house?

130
00:08:54,709 --> 00:08:56,833
'Anbirkiniyal'
in bold capital letters

131
00:08:56,874 --> 00:08:59,041
But I haven't paid my EMI dues
for 3 months, you know?

132
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:02,790
If it continues like this, the board will
be right there, bank will seize our house

133
00:09:02,827 --> 00:09:05,743
That's alright, why can't you go
through tough times right here?

134
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,916
What a staff nurse can earn
 in 1 month over there

135
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:10,166
...will take 10 months
for me to earn the same!

136
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:12,417
I can't repay our loans if I am here

137
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:13,629
And also

138
00:09:13,709 --> 00:09:16,625
There's a very important reason
for me to go to Canada

139
00:09:17,315 --> 00:09:20,315
Men above 60 over there

140
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,375
...are super smart it seems

141
00:09:22,417 --> 00:09:27,000
I'll fix up an awesome gentleman for you

142
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:30,790
Look how you are blushing!

143
00:09:31,041 --> 00:09:32,208
[honking]

144
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:35,082
He's ready and waiting for me, right?
Now he'll yell out my name

145
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:36,709
As if I've vanished into thin air

146
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:37,833
ANBU

147
00:09:37,874 --> 00:09:38,916
You can hear his voice now

148
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:40,125
'ANBU...!'

149
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:41,790
I told you

150
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:43,583
Okay, I have to go now, bye

151
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,333
Hey! 1 minute

152
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:50,790
Don't go there and look for
a suitable companion 60-70 years old

153
00:09:50,835 --> 00:09:52,628
If you still want to do so

154
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:56,250
Between 50 to 52

155
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:57,542
That should suit me fine

156
00:09:57,583 --> 00:09:58,583
I thought as much!

157
00:09:58,606 --> 00:10:02,356
What is the age limit?
Fifty to fifty two, huh?

158
00:10:03,075 --> 00:10:04,659
I'll pickle you to pieces!

159
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,709
- Bye
- 'Bye, dear'

160
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,250
Raghavan sir

161
00:10:10,292 --> 00:10:12,125
Come home early this evening

162
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:14,500
I have an important discussion

163
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:15,874
'Yov!'

164
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:18,125
Pondicherry matter is pending, right?

165
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:20,583
If you come back early
we can finish that

166
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:23,542
Just get us some appetizer to go with it

167
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:25,583
Why are you throwing
this sudden bombshell?

168
00:10:25,635 --> 00:10:27,453
I have to fund booze
and appetizer too, huh?

169
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:30,000
- Fatso! Don't hanker after freebie-
- Don't go on a yelling spree

170
00:10:30,041 --> 00:10:32,874
Your plan of buying booze for Rs 500
and free dinner for Rs 1000 is super!

171
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:34,625
- 'Okay...okay'
- What are you okaying?

172
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:37,164
Your quota for this month
 is over, remember?

173
00:10:37,211 --> 00:10:38,332
Fixing...?

174
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:39,417
MIX-ing!

175
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:41,125
- What?
- Come soon

176
00:10:41,567 --> 00:10:43,484
You got ready late
and you yell at me

177
00:10:43,544 --> 00:10:46,002
Rub the 'chunam' off your neck

178
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:53,417
I don't generally dab
powder on my face

179
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:54,790
- I'm sure you don't!
- Natural

180
00:10:54,828 --> 00:10:56,663
Anbu, come soon

181
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:02,958
Let's go

182
00:11:03,492 --> 00:11:05,284
- Switched off the stove?
- Yes

183
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:07,305
Aiyo! Wait, now I have second thoughts

184
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:08,790
Why did you ask me now?

185
00:11:11,226 --> 00:11:14,559
Last night did you go to
 Raghavan uncle's house?

186
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:17,945
Last night you went to
 Raghavan uncle's house, right?

187
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,125
No, I didn't

188
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:20,542
I'll punch your face
if you lie to me

189
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:22,292
As if we won't visit our neighbor?

190
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:23,833
Mind your business, man

191
00:11:24,667 --> 00:11:27,250
Pa, this is the 6th person telling me

192
00:11:27,292 --> 00:11:29,250
That you don't like me going to Canada

193
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:33,320
Mr Shivam, shall I ask you a question?

194
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:36,625
Roaming from road to road a whole month
and selling your insurance policies

195
00:11:36,667 --> 00:11:37,874
How much will you get?

196
00:11:37,916 --> 00:11:39,333
How does that concern you?

197
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:41,292
Why do you think
I attended this ILTS course?

198
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:42,742
And took up a part-time job?

199
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:44,458
You are going out of sheer boredom

200
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,891
What else?
Temerity!

201
00:11:45,929 --> 00:11:47,012
APPA!

202
00:11:47,542 --> 00:11:48,874
What do you want now?

203
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,516
Go to Canada?
That's it, right?

204
00:11:50,538 --> 00:11:53,093
By all means, go, let me suffer
living all alone in solitude here

205
00:11:53,693 --> 00:11:57,401
Didn't you leave amma and me alone here
and go to Saudi when I was in school?

206
00:11:57,625 --> 00:12:00,667
Hey! I went only because I wanted
 to give you all the comforts

207
00:12:00,709 --> 00:12:03,375
Do you know how much
I suffered in that hot climate?

208
00:12:03,417 --> 00:12:04,583
Do you know?

209
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:06,417
Cha! I've tanned so much

210
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:09,750
Pa, why are you seriously being so funny?

211
00:12:10,134 --> 00:12:13,468
Did you have Aamir Khan's
 skin tone earlier?

212
00:12:13,525 --> 00:12:15,857
My dear princess
Everything is a joke for you

213
00:12:15,892 --> 00:12:19,892
You can go to Canada
or even to Kailasa island!

214
00:12:19,942 --> 00:12:23,401
If you want, tell me
I'll take you straight to the airport

215
00:12:23,445 --> 00:12:25,153
Shall I go...shall I right now?

216
00:12:25,195 --> 00:12:29,195
Appa, you don't even have enough fuel
to take us to the nearest petrol bunk

217
00:12:29,245 --> 00:12:30,953
Will you head for a bunk first?

218
00:12:31,009 --> 00:12:32,051
True that!

219
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:38,166
Who is calling you?

220
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:39,458
Diana

221
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,458
You keep getting calls
from this Diana

222
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,833
Why don't you pick it up?

223
00:12:42,874 --> 00:12:44,125
We are in a bunk, pa

224
00:12:44,667 --> 00:12:47,992
Instead of making friends
with Diana and Dora

225
00:12:48,027 --> 00:12:50,734
...why don't you befriend
our own people?

226
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:52,250
'Our own people' means?

227
00:12:53,874 --> 00:12:55,041
Come here

228
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:56,292
Closer

229
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:58,000
Our community

230
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:03,542
Appa, the state at which our nation is
right now, why are you fanning the flames?

231
00:13:03,593 --> 00:13:05,635
That too in this petrol bunk

232
00:13:05,874 --> 00:13:07,916
Don't spin the same tale on me today

233
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:10,041
I'll call and hang up,
so you know I called

234
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:12,833
That's the cue for you
to take your medicine

235
00:13:12,874 --> 00:13:15,208
Who will do this for me
after you go to Canada?

236
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:16,916
I'll do the same setting an alarm

237
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:18,833
In your dreams!
Sonny, fill up for Rs 150

238
00:13:18,874 --> 00:13:20,000
Do you know this?

239
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:22,000
If it's night here,
it's daytime in Canada

240
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:24,790
My friends' children went abroad

241
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:26,934
Not one of them kept in touch you know?

242
00:13:26,984 --> 00:13:29,192
- How can you compare me with them?
- Who knows?

243
00:13:29,234 --> 00:13:30,742
- Whaaat?
- I was just kidding

244
00:13:30,785 --> 00:13:33,702
What were you kidding about?
I would really like to know

245
00:13:33,734 --> 00:13:36,110
- You got the guts, speak up
- I just did

246
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,625
'Fill for Rs 100'

247
00:13:42,153 --> 00:13:43,528
See you tonight, bye, pa

248
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:45,250
Anbu

249
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:46,790
Come here

250
00:13:47,247 --> 00:13:49,539
For a long time, I've been
wanting to ask you this

251
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:52,083
You keep getting a call often, right?

252
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:54,583
Even when we were at the bunk

253
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,916
- What is her name?
- Diana

254
00:13:56,958 --> 00:13:58,166
Diana

255
00:13:58,208 --> 00:14:00,791
Ask that Diana to take
1 insurance policy from me

256
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:02,874
Month end
Pressure

257
00:14:02,934 --> 00:14:04,101
Please tell her

258
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:05,790
I can tell her

259
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:08,526
But she doesn't belong to
 our community, right?

260
00:14:08,578 --> 00:14:10,911
You have all these boundaries

261
00:14:10,983 --> 00:14:13,191
You are so clannish, isn't it?

262
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,125
See you in the evening, bye

263
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:17,234
I'll give you a call and
hang up, take your medicine

264
00:14:17,278 --> 00:14:19,445
No need your medicine or
any other ball of mud, bye

265
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:23,009
'Present unreal conditionals
 make hypothetical statements'

266
00:14:23,075 --> 00:14:25,992
'Then show what would happen
in such situations'

267
00:14:26,301 --> 00:14:27,926
Have you applied for the test?

268
00:14:27,977 --> 00:14:30,644
Planning to do so by this weekend

269
00:14:30,693 --> 00:14:32,359
But I need to prepare for it

270
00:14:32,393 --> 00:14:34,312
I don't even mind
this 'reading & writing'

271
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:36,125
Listening is way too tough

272
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:39,709
- Can't we learn watching English movies?
- So my friends told me

273
00:14:39,765 --> 00:14:41,725
So I started watching them

274
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,751
But they hardly spoke! Only action

275
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,417
Oh my! Which film was that?

276
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:47,208
Top secret!
Okay, bye

277
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:48,500
Wretched female!

278
00:14:48,542 --> 00:14:49,874
Bye, Priya

279
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:53,750
Hey Anbu

280
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:56,083
Hey darling! Why not look at me lovingly?

281
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:08,750
So many fellows do penance
on one foot for love

282
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:10,916
I'm vaulting over a pole for you

283
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:13,250
Anbu...your love is just in your name, huh?

284
00:15:27,293 --> 00:15:31,168
Dude, I get so bugged when I hear
the words 'not today, tomorrow'

285
00:15:31,328 --> 00:15:34,203
You know how I got married
in a tearing hurry, eh?

286
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:37,500
Only if we make out on our wedding night
we can call it 'first night'

287
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:40,417
That night hasn't dawned as yet!

288
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:42,583
She repeats only one word, da

289
00:15:42,643 --> 00:15:44,268
'Tomorrow...tomorrow'

290
00:15:44,317 --> 00:15:45,858
I am really facing a dead end

291
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,900
Dude, theater or shopping
she'll get ready at once

292
00:15:47,961 --> 00:15:50,294
If it's visiting her mom
she'll fly without even telling me

293
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:53,458
But if I broach my wish-list
she will go on this broken record mode

294
00:15:53,526 --> 00:15:55,817
How long can I put up
with this 'tomorrow' mantra?

295
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:57,726
The entire stock will be
delivered tomorrow, sir

296
00:15:58,354 --> 00:15:59,395
Tomorrow, huh?

297
00:15:59,874 --> 00:16:01,417
Hey...hey!

298
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:03,417
Who invented this word
'Tomorrow'?

299
00:16:03,567 --> 00:16:05,484
Will they twiddle their thumbs today then?

300
00:16:05,534 --> 00:16:07,908
How can anyone use
 the word 'tomorrow'?

301
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:11,250
If you say that damn word
you are dead meat, man

302
00:16:11,292 --> 00:16:12,417
Get lost!

303
00:16:14,059 --> 00:16:16,766
- Dude, you there?
- I'll call you 'tomorrow'!

304
00:16:27,593 --> 00:16:28,758
Where are you hitting me?!

305
00:16:28,791 --> 00:16:31,000
Sorry, sir
Missed it

306
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:32,375
I swear that isn't funny!

307
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:34,833
- Do your job properly
- 'Yes, sir'

308
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,500
Are you drawing
a 'rangoli' or what?

309
00:16:38,542 --> 00:16:41,083
- Wipe fast
- Yes, sir

310
00:16:44,636 --> 00:16:46,094
Why are you getting distracted?

311
00:16:57,333 --> 00:16:58,958
Hi, your order please

312
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:05,166
"The way she views life daily
Celebrating every moment truly"

313
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:11,458
"She seizes every moment of her life
Lives it to the fullest without any strife"

314
00:17:11,542 --> 00:17:16,000
"You take life easy duly
on your shoulders daily"

315
00:17:16,062 --> 00:17:19,528
"You are a firefly
in the sky flying high"

316
00:17:19,551 --> 00:17:23,968
"Like a world by yourself anew"

317
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,458
"On the grass you're a drop of fresh dew"

318
00:17:27,499 --> 00:17:30,165
- Dealing with customers is an art
- Yes, sir

319
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,534
- When will you learn that art?
- Right now, sir

320
00:17:32,567 --> 00:17:33,609
I'm asking you seriously

321
00:17:33,648 --> 00:17:34,606
Excuse me

322
00:17:34,667 --> 00:17:38,166
Is your chicken in house
or is it from outside?

323
00:17:39,667 --> 00:17:43,083
Sir, actually all our chickens
are coming from big farm

324
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:45,125
Small small autos and lorries, sir

325
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:47,958
Roads are contracts by politicians, sir

326
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,625
Jumping, jumping, sir

327
00:17:49,702 --> 00:17:52,452
Roads are deep risky, sir

328
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:55,134
But we are delivering
our chicken...crispy, sir

329
00:17:55,562 --> 00:17:58,604
Customers are licking like...this, sir

330
00:17:58,646 --> 00:17:59,646
How is the work?

331
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:00,974
Chicken best, sir

332
00:18:01,028 --> 00:18:02,278
Customer trust, sir

333
00:18:02,305 --> 00:18:03,763
Your English is worst!

334
00:18:04,044 --> 00:18:05,336
Namaste, sir

335
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:08,958
Scumbag, do you understand?

336
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:11,583
- Sir, he is the right person
- Okay

337
00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:13,083
Your all the questions, sir

338
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:14,208
He answers, sir

339
00:18:14,542 --> 00:18:16,000
- Clean India, sir
- Okay

340
00:18:16,667 --> 00:18:17,916
Excuse me

341
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:19,435
Is your chicken in house

342
00:18:19,487 --> 00:18:21,153
- Or from outside?
- Out of stock, sir

343
00:18:21,218 --> 00:18:22,593
I'll handle this, you go

344
00:18:22,984 --> 00:18:24,150
How may I help you?

345
00:18:24,176 --> 00:18:26,385
Is your chicken in house
or from outside?

346
00:18:26,449 --> 00:18:29,741
So all the chicken are from
our own poultry farm, sir

347
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:30,874
Not outside

348
00:18:30,916 --> 00:18:32,208
- Can I take your order?
- Okay

349

Charles, huh?

- Yes
- What's his problem this time?

365
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,500
He has no responsibility whatsoever

366
00:19:26,542 --> 00:19:29,083
He went to play a cricket match
instead of attending an interview

367
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:30,958
But he lied to me
he went for the interview

368
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,458
Even the first time you met him

369
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:35,185

And ask him the next day
'have you had breakfast?'

00:28:01,166 --> 00:28:02,375
Very bad

525
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:06,458
It's okay

526
00:28:11,670 --> 00:28:13,127
Swear on amma

527
00:28:18,369 --> 00:28:20,410
What...got electrocuted?

528
00:28:21,083 --> 00:28:23,625
Why won't you say so?
Place your hand on her photo

529
00:28:26,567 --> 00:28:29,150
Your mother loved my style
of smoking a cigarette

530
00:28:29,458 --> 00:28:31,292
She used to appreciate it sooo much

531
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:34,583
You think you're Superstar Rajinikanth
to romanticize smoking!

532
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:38,375
Good night, dear
I'm reminded of your mother

533
00:28:38,417 --> 00:28:39,667
APPA!

534
00:28:40,542 --> 00:28:42,958
Don't make any promises to anyone

535
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,500
Your mother made me promise
in Satyam theatre you know?

536
00:28:45,544 --> 00:28:46,544
Ji?

537
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:48,667
Won't you let me go, ji?

538
00:28:49,458 --> 00:28:50,458
Place your hand

539
00:28:51,874 --> 00:28:53,958
Do you have cigarettes
stashed anywhere else?

540
00:28:54,426 --> 00:28:56,176
What does 'hmm' mean?
Take them out

541
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,625
Hey! Hand...hand here

542
00:29:02,268 --> 00:29:04,726
Is that a safety locker?
Take that out too

543
00:29:06,897 --> 00:29:08,773
Is this all or-

544
00:29:19,083 --> 00:29:20,375
Oh my God!

545
00:29:21,458 --> 00:29:23,916
Are you smoking or
selling cigarettes, pa?

546
00:29:26,125 --> 00:29:29,375
What will happen if all this nicotine
spreads into your body?

547
00:29:34,625 --> 00:29:36,041
Open your mouth

548
00:29:38,667 --> 00:29:40,667
When I think back on my school days

549
00:29:40,709 --> 00:29:43,958
...I can only remember you running
 from one hospital to another for amma

550
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:49,458
Wasn't it to pay her hospital bills...

551
00:29:49,526 --> 00:29:52,192
...you mortgaged your dream house
as collateral to the bank?

552
00:29:53,709 --> 00:29:57,791
That day, unable to pay the interest
when you begged the bank officer

553
00:29:57,833 --> 00:30:00,292
I just couldn't bear to watch it, pa

554
00:30:02,125 --> 00:30:03,375
Enough, pa

555
00:30:05,276 --> 00:30:08,526
You've suffered a lot
for both amma and me

556
00:30:09,214 --> 00:30:12,547
I want to take good care of you, pa

557
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:17,874
Reason I am going to Canada
is not to put miles between us

558
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,986
I want to pay off these loans

559
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:23,166
I wish to be with you always
and see you smile, pa

560
00:30:23,302 --> 00:30:24,843
Appa, please

561
00:30:25,197 --> 00:30:26,989
Don't smoke, pa

562
00:30:28,525 --> 00:30:31,149
Allow me to smoke
one last cigarette, dear

563
00:30:38,166 --> 00:30:41,583
Just like you can't forget your 1st puff
the same goes for the last

564
00:30:42,534 --> 00:30:43,833
God is great!

565
00:30:43,874 --> 00:30:45,790
If Anbu orders, appa will drop
the cigarette habit

566
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:46,872
That's it!

567
00:30:47,375 --> 00:30:49,833
From tomorrow,
appa's lifestyle will change

568
00:30:49,874 --> 00:30:52,667
I will maintain my body
and health properly

569
00:30:52,766 --> 00:30:56,101
I'll avoid Raghavan even if
he calls me in the evening

570
00:30:56,142 --> 00:30:57,434
He'll call me over to drink

571
00:30:58,667 --> 00:31:01,125
I'll be so sober and eat
just 2 'chappatis' for dinner

572
00:31:01,166 --> 00:31:04,667
And remember to take my sugar pills
even before you call me

573
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:09,199
Half an hour before bed time
if I could enjoy just 1 cigarette

574
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:13,083
...you think anything bad may happen
because of my promise to you?

575
00:31:13,166 --> 00:31:14,250
For sure, yes

576
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,583
Appa has quit smoking!

577
00:31:28,542 --> 00:31:30,292
Hurry up, da

578
00:31:30,333 --> 00:31:34,000
Akka, you feast on chicken and mutton
to your tummy's content, right?

579
00:31:34,041 --> 00:31:35,916
Even you can't handle this cold

580
00:31:35,958 --> 00:31:37,958
Look at me
I'm a pure vegetarian

581
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,011
How can I handle it?

582
00:31:39,051 --> 00:31:42,801
Being a vegetarian or non vegetarian
is of no consequence to this minus degree

583
00:31:43,208 --> 00:31:44,916
Hey, chi!
Pass it on quickly

584
00:31:45,458 --> 00:31:48,333
Akka, it is a great sin for me
to just touch this chicken

585
00:31:48,393 --> 00:31:50,017
You carry this sin yourself

586
00:31:52,333 --> 00:31:56,000
Did this month's salary
get credited for you?

587
00:31:56,041 --> 00:31:57,625
Ohhh...yes

588
00:31:58,125 --> 00:32:01,166
Then you carry the rest of the sin yourself

589
00:32:01,222 --> 00:32:03,000
Are you leaving?
 Come back soon

590
00:32:03,041 --> 00:32:04,208
Or I'll just freeze here

591
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:05,333
- Can you hear me?
- 'Hello?'

592
00:32:05,375 --> 00:32:06,874
- 'Hello?'
- Hello, weak signal here

593
00:32:06,916 --> 00:32:07,932
Can you hear me?

594
00:32:07,969 --> 00:32:09,594
- Can you hear me now?
- 'I can hear you'

595
00:32:10,017 --> 00:32:11,017
I got the job

596
00:32:11,041 --> 00:32:13,041
Hey! Super, da!

597
00:32:13,125 --> 00:32:14,750
Wow! When and where?

598
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:16,625
But the placement
is in Hyderabad

599
00:32:16,667 --> 00:32:17,750
'I have to leave tomorrow'

600
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:19,375
- Tomorrow?
- No...no

601
00:32:19,616 --> 00:32:21,865
If you aren't keen, tell me
That job is no big deal

602
00:32:21,916 --> 00:32:22,958
'I will just trash it'

603
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,333
What you say goes

604
00:32:24,375 --> 00:32:25,874
Don't be a drama king

605
00:32:25,916 --> 00:32:27,333
You had better leave!

606
00:32:27,791 --> 00:32:29,874
Okay, can you come and pick me up?

607
00:32:30,874 --> 00:32:31,874
Now?

608
00:32:31,916 --> 00:32:33,250
Don't you want to see me?

609
00:32:33,292 --> 00:32:36,125
Of course I do
But some slight hiccups

610
00:32:36,166 --> 00:32:37,667
- 'What?'
- Okay, wait, I'll come

611
00:32:38,184 --> 00:32:39,268
Okay, bye

612
00:32:39,905 --> 00:32:41,239
Any of you got cologne?

613
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:42,698
Rubbish! You had only vodka

614
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:44,292
- You won't stink of booze, go
- Sure?

615
00:32:44,333 --> 00:32:45,458
Yeah, get lost

616
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,375
Making a huge fuss
That's how I've escaped often

617
00:32:47,417 --> 00:32:50,542
What on earth will you do
 going home so early?

618
00:32:51,718 --> 00:32:53,593
I am a newly married man

619
00:32:53,958 --> 00:32:56,041
Have you ever seen me go home early?

620
00:32:56,484 --> 00:32:58,317
I come in first and leave last, why?

621
00:33:00,458 --> 00:33:01,500
What, da?

622
00:33:02,583 --> 00:33:04,000
Go, I'll deal with you later

623
00:33:05,125 --> 00:33:06,417
Tell me, why?

624
00:33:06,458 --> 00:33:08,166
- What can I say-
- Huh?

625
00:33:08,833 --> 00:33:11,916
It's my commitment towards this firm
and how sincerely I care for my customers

626
00:33:11,958 --> 00:33:13,000
- Yes, sir
- Sir

627
00:33:13,041 --> 00:33:14,500
Your wife had called

628
00:33:14,542 --> 00:33:15,791
- Today
- Today?

629
00:33:15,833 --> 00:33:18,790
She'll sleep early today it seems
She asked you to eat outside and come

630
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:20,667
- Dai
- Hmm?

631
00:33:26,333 --> 00:33:27,417
Sir

632
00:33:27,583 --> 00:33:29,333
Thanks, I'll see you tomorrow

633
00:33:29,458 --> 00:33:30,790
Hey...peh!

634
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:33,667
- Okay, I'm leaving
- Got permission?

635
00:33:33,709 --> 00:33:36,000
To grant just 2 hours permission
he spoke nonstop for an hour!

636
00:33:36,028 --> 00:33:38,153
Is your guy going
 by bus to Hyderabad?

637
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:40,418
You go and drop him
Or he'll go back to his match!

638
00:33:40,476 --> 00:33:42,351
- No, akka, he has changed
- Oh really?!

639
00:33:42,417 --> 00:33:44,083
I heard it on the News

640
00:33:44,125 --> 00:33:45,458
Stop teasing me
I have to go

641
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:46,542
Be safe

642
00:33:52,988 --> 00:33:54,238
I swear this is true

643
00:33:54,292 --> 00:33:56,432
If I go to Hyderabad
I'll miss you like crazy

644
00:33:56,456 --> 00:33:58,414
I'll also miss you, da

645
00:33:58,463 --> 00:33:59,962
Why should we miss each other?

646
00:34:00,059 --> 00:34:01,850
Why don't you come
 with me to Hyderabad?

647
00:34:02,158 --> 00:34:03,617
Nurses get a fat salary over there

648
00:34:03,662 --> 00:34:05,203
Why do you want to go to Canada?

649
00:34:05,244 --> 00:34:08,362
There isn't much of a difference
between my dad and you, da

650
00:34:08,417 --> 00:34:11,333
He smothers me with hugs
and with soulful words you beg

651
00:34:11,625 --> 00:34:12,958
I have an idea for you

652
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,500
Don't go to Hyderabad tomorrow

653
00:34:14,536 --> 00:34:15,453
Really?!

654
00:34:15,503 --> 00:34:16,670
Leave tonight

655
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:20,101
I am definitely going to Canada
I won't change my mind come what may

656
00:34:20,142 --> 00:34:22,559
Oh! Then I have to make a serious decision

657
00:34:22,636 --> 00:34:24,135
What serious decision, da?

658
00:34:24,168 --> 00:34:27,418
I'll tell my mother to find me a girl
ready to come to Hyderabad and marry her

659
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:30,187
- Oh! You'll marry another girl?
- Yes

660
00:34:32,667 --> 00:34:34,250
Dai! Stop, I say

661
00:34:34,536 --> 00:34:36,743
So, you've made up your mind
 to marry another girl

662
00:34:36,778 --> 00:34:38,070
Yes, I will

663
00:34:38,601 --> 00:34:39,643
Okay

664
00:34:39,693 --> 00:34:42,734
I'll attend your wedding
and then go to Canada

665
00:34:42,774 --> 00:34:45,609
How can I miss eating the 'biriyani'
at your wedding feast?

666
00:34:45,667 --> 00:34:46,958
No need to trouble yourself

667
00:34:46,993 --> 00:34:48,993
My wife and I will come
 to Canada for our honeymoon

668
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:52,727
Find a cold location in Canada

669
00:34:53,008 --> 00:34:55,425
Under the bed sheets

670
00:34:55,495 --> 00:34:57,286
Dai! 'Complan' boy
Move it

671
00:34:57,549 --> 00:34:58,507
Go, da

672
00:34:58,625 --> 00:34:59,625
Get lost!

673
00:34:59,667 --> 00:35:01,636
Take some elders
from home with you, go

674
00:35:15,413 --> 00:35:16,828
Hey stop

675
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:19,250
Park your bike to the side

676
00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:21,830
Come, stop here

677
00:35:23,709 --> 00:35:24,874
Where is your helmet?

678
00:35:24,916 --> 00:35:26,542
I didn't bring it, sir

679
00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:28,791
- Then come with me, man
- Get down

680
00:35:32,625 --> 00:35:34,083
'Pay the fine and go'

681
00:35:37,526 --> 00:35:39,401
'Dai, how much do you have on you?'

682
00:35:39,442 --> 00:35:42,817
I put all my money into Dream 11
game app and I'm penniless now, sir

683
00:35:44,125 --> 00:35:46,250
- What's this petty cash, da?
- That's all I got, sir

684
00:35:46,292 --> 00:35:47,583
What the hell!
Take it

685
00:35:47,625 --> 00:35:49,958
Sir, it's a helmet case
If you tell me what to do

686
00:35:51,667 --> 00:35:53,916
What are you doing
out here at this time of night?

687
00:35:53,958 --> 00:35:55,916
Sir, I came to drop...at home

688
00:35:58,866 --> 00:35:59,950
Drop whom?

689
00:36:05,161 --> 00:36:07,378
If it is that big a secret
you don't have to tell me, sir

690
00:36:07,417 --> 00:36:09,709
We want you to wear a helmet
for your own safety, right?

691
00:36:13,461 --> 00:36:16,432
Looks like sir doesn't take
safe precautions in any situation!

692
00:36:19,417 --> 00:36:21,659
- Okay, take it and let him go
- Okay, come with me

693
00:36:21,709 --> 00:36:23,500
You heard him, right?

694
00:36:28,333 --> 00:36:30,417
Damn swindler!

695
00:36:30,833 --> 00:36:31,833
What happened, Charles?

696
00:36:31,874 --> 00:36:32,790
Get onto the bike

697
00:36:32,833 --> 00:36:34,214
- Or I'll kill him, let's go
- What?

698
00:36:34,253 --> 00:36:35,294
Hey!

699
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:37,250
Stop

700
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:41,333
Are you drunk?

701
00:36:41,833 --> 00:36:42,791
No

702
00:36:42,833 --> 00:36:44,000
- Huh?
- No

703
00:36:44,685 --> 00:36:46,017
You're losing your temper?

704
00:36:46,083 --> 00:36:48,000
- Not drunk?
- No, sir

705
00:36:48,333 --> 00:36:49,500
No

706
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:54,948
Vodka?

707
00:36:56,333 --> 00:36:57,375
Yov!

708
00:36:57,418 --> 00:36:58,418
Sir...?

709
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,041
Blow

710
00:37:10,445 --> 00:37:12,070
Sir has passed the test

711
00:37:12,134 --> 00:37:14,093
Let's take him to
the station and honor him

712
00:37:14,830 --> 00:37:16,456
What? Go

713
00:37:17,656 --> 00:37:19,696
- What area?
- Indira Nagar, sir

714
00:37:19,899 --> 00:37:21,024
Huh?

715
00:37:21,059 --> 00:37:22,476
Indira Nagar

716
00:37:22,833 --> 00:37:25,874
Get this girl's father's phone #
Ask him to pick her up from the station

717
00:37:25,916 --> 00:37:26,874
'Okay, sir'

718
00:37:27,134 --> 00:37:28,758
Sir...sir, why all that?

719
00:37:28,791 --> 00:37:29,916
I'll pay the fine, sir

720
00:37:29,958 --> 00:37:31,792
Please talk to him, sir
Don't call her father

721
00:37:31,874 --> 00:37:33,791
- Get the girl into the jeep
- Yes, sir

722
00:37:34,083 --> 00:37:35,709
Sir...sir

723
00:37:35,874 --> 00:37:37,750
That girl lives close by

724
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:40,125
We can send her back by auto
Why get her into trouble, sir?

725
00:37:40,166 --> 00:37:42,339
The state our nation is in
why do you add to the chaos?

726
00:37:42,625 --> 00:37:44,250
Yov! He's drunk too

727
00:37:44,542 --> 00:37:46,542
What if he has his fun
and then burns her?

728
00:37:46,583 --> 00:37:48,083
- Will you take responsibility?
- Sir!

729
00:37:48,125 --> 00:37:49,292
What is that 'sir' in aid of?

730
00:37:49,333 --> 00:37:50,916
Feeling sorry for no reason

731
00:37:53,083 --> 00:37:54,667
She'll ride pillion
on a drunkard's bike

732
00:37:54,702 --> 00:37:56,327
Won't get into a police jeep?

733
00:37:56,791 --> 00:37:58,791
[whistling]

734
00:38:03,958 --> 00:38:05,333
- Sir, tea
- Hey!

735
00:38:05,591 --> 00:38:07,550
Serve tea to the chap inside also

736
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:10,417
How many family members?

737
00:38:12,292 --> 00:38:15,000
- Why can't I get green tea?!
- Hey!

738
00:38:15,083 --> 00:38:16,458
Getting too big for your boots, eh?

739
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,625
Requesting just to reduce it, right?

740
00:38:21,791 --> 00:38:22,833
Give me the number

741
00:38:22,916 --> 00:38:25,250
9-8-4-1-1

742
00:38:25,401 --> 00:38:26,651
6

743
00:38:27,417 --> 00:38:28,709
Tell me the rest of the numbers

744
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:29,709
- 0-0-6-1

745
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:30,916
[whistling]

746
00:38:31,583 --> 00:38:33,667
Do you live at the address
registered in your license?

747
00:38:33,709 --> 00:38:34,833
Yes, sir

748
00:38:37,666 --> 00:38:40,207
- Where is your father employed?
- He has passed away

749
00:38:40,727 --> 00:38:42,437
Sir, that girl's father has come

750
00:38:46,874 --> 00:38:48,166
Tell him to come in

751
00:39:00,958 --> 00:39:03,393
Nothing serious to the extent
you seem worried, please sit

752
00:39:06,309 --> 00:39:08,351
Tell me if you can identify that boy

753
00:39:13,625 --> 00:39:14,791
I don't know him

754
00:39:17,333 --> 00:39:19,000
When we caught him
for a drunk & drive case

755
00:39:19,041 --> 00:39:20,417
...your daughter was with him

756
00:39:21,718 --> 00:39:23,956
You had to find out
your daughter loves a chap

757
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,874
...in a situation where you
had to come to the police station

758
00:39:28,562 --> 00:39:30,728
Come here
Come sit here

759
00:39:33,125 --> 00:39:34,083
Sit down

760
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:39,000
Sir, it wasn't such a big deal

761
00:39:39,041 --> 00:39:41,709
I could have collected the fine
at the spot and let them go

762
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:45,250
I brought you here for the sole reason
you should know what's going on

763
00:39:45,542 --> 00:39:48,208
The police force is responsible for
 the safety of our nation's women

764
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:50,166
[mocking laughter]

765
00:39:50,790 --> 00:39:51,833
Hey!

766
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:53,333
Not me

767
00:39:53,375 --> 00:39:54,333
It was him

768
00:39:54,375 --> 00:39:55,958
Let him be, sir

769
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,333
Temerity from head to toe

770
00:40:01,333 --> 00:40:02,667
What's your name, dear?

771
00:40:02,709 --> 00:40:04,041
Anbirkiniyal

772
00:40:05,125 --> 00:40:07,250
Your appa has chosen
such a lovely name for you

773
00:40:08,083 --> 00:40:09,542
What's your name, son?

774
00:40:09,583 --> 00:40:11,041
Charles Sebastian

775
00:40:12,085 --> 00:40:13,627
Is there any connection, sir?

776
00:40:15,208 --> 00:40:17,791
Intention with which boys like him
fall in love is wrong per se, sir

777
00:40:18,417 --> 00:40:20,166
I can tell by just looking at his face

778
00:40:21,083 --> 00:40:23,625
I attend 100s of such cases daily, sir

779
00:40:25,542 --> 00:40:29,375
Look, if this continues, your case will
 also be filed in this station tomorrow

780
00:40:29,417 --> 00:40:30,709
Take it from me

781
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:32,250
You seem like a decent person

782
00:40:32,583 --> 00:40:34,916
Put some sense into her head
and take her home

783
00:40:35,874 --> 00:40:36,916
Go home

784
00:41:21,625 --> 00:41:22,625
Appa

785
00:41:29,041 --> 00:41:30,000
Please-

786
00:41:54,458 --> 00:41:55,833
[honking]

787
00:42:19,790 --> 00:42:22,320
'Tickets are available from
the beginning of next month'

788
00:42:22,375 --> 00:42:24,789
'But rates are a bit high
because of the season'

789
00:42:24,827 --> 00:42:27,203
You will be paying less
if you book end of the month

790
00:42:27,276 --> 00:42:29,025
What is your preference, sir?

791
00:42:29,067 --> 00:42:30,858
The rate doesn't matter

792
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:32,734
Book the first available ticket

793
00:42:32,782 --> 00:42:34,450
She has to leave for Canada
at the earliest

794
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:36,041
Okay, sir
Thanks

795
00:42:39,833 --> 00:42:40,874
Excuse me

796
00:42:48,192 --> 00:42:49,858
Appa...appa

797
00:43:03,374 --> 00:43:05,710
- 'Won't you check the stock?
- We did, sir'

798
00:43:05,751 --> 00:43:07,168
'Don't know how the rat got in'

799
00:43:07,218 --> 00:43:08,926
'Who knows if it was you or the rat?'

800
00:43:08,983 --> 00:43:10,608
'Sorry, sir, this won't happen again'

801
00:43:10,651 --> 00:43:13,276
'How will the customer accept my apology?
Why should I be humiliated?'

802
00:43:13,301 --> 00:43:15,758
- What happened, akka?
- You checked the stock yesterday?

803
00:43:15,791 --> 00:43:18,000
Bhavesh and I checked it

804
00:43:18,083 --> 00:43:21,041
Rats ruined all the stock
Manager is asking for you

805
00:43:21,109 --> 00:43:23,401
Is it my job to listen
to all your stupid excuses?

806
00:43:23,450 --> 00:43:24,492
Come, madam

807
00:43:24,534 --> 00:43:26,117
You can leave
I've fired you

808
00:43:26,174 --> 00:43:28,966
You have been chosen for
'The Best Sales Girl' award this year

809
00:43:29,166 --> 00:43:31,500
You've worked so diligently you see

810
00:43:31,542 --> 00:43:33,958
I'll be the one targeted
during the time of inspection

811
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,734
I've repeated this 100 times to you

812
00:43:35,775 --> 00:43:37,858
Check the list when we get fresh stock

813
00:43:38,333 --> 00:43:39,874
This stock is worth Rs 12,000

814
00:43:40,083 --> 00:43:41,790
Will your father reimburse?

815
00:43:42,801 --> 00:43:44,134
Why are you glaring at me?

816
00:43:44,161 --> 00:43:47,411
When you flashed your teeth asking me
for 1 hour permission did you glare at me?

817
00:43:47,976 --> 00:43:48,934
Huh?

818
00:43:49,166 --> 00:43:53,000
If you repeat this once more
my words will spit out differently!

819
00:43:54,343 --> 00:43:55,758
- Clear out!
- Sir...sir

820
00:43:55,791 --> 00:43:57,625
Please, sir
Forgive me this once

821
00:43:57,667 --> 00:43:58,791
Sir...sir

822
00:43:59,495 --> 00:44:01,036
It's okay
Get ready

823
00:44:01,086 --> 00:44:03,544
'Call after sometime'

824
00:44:20,567 --> 00:44:21,942
Have you washed your hands?

825
00:44:22,791 --> 00:44:25,292
Customers are waiting in queue
out there, but it's okay

826
00:44:25,442 --> 00:44:26,774
You stuff your face!

827
00:44:27,059 --> 00:44:28,559
Isn't that the reason we are here?

828
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:30,667
Cha!

829
00:44:36,359 --> 00:44:38,567
- Sir, your order #?
- 98

830
00:44:39,083 --> 00:44:40,458
You go, I'll attend to him

831
00:44:40,961 --> 00:44:42,253
Give me order # 98

832
00:44:43,625 --> 00:44:45,125
Thank you

833
00:44:47,234 --> 00:44:48,791
- Hi
- Anbu, come outside

834
00:44:48,833 --> 00:44:50,750
Sir, can I take your order please?

835
00:44:51,458 --> 00:44:53,750
Anbu, I need to talk
to you now, come outside

836
00:44:53,790 --> 00:44:55,667
Customers are waiting
Please give your order

837
00:44:55,701 --> 00:44:57,158
I'm leaving for Hyderabad tonight

838
00:44:57,195 --> 00:44:58,612
We can't talk after this, understan-

839
00:44:58,654 --> 00:45:00,695
- Sir, customers are waiting
- Hello

840
00:45:01,292 --> 00:45:02,874
Keep your love story out of this

841
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:05,734
Can't you see customers are waiting?

842
00:45:06,333 --> 00:45:07,709
Is this some kind of drama?

843
00:45:07,781 --> 00:45:08,824
Sorry, sir

844
00:45:08,874 --> 00:45:10,791
1 Coke
1 French fries

845
00:45:10,950 --> 00:45:13,659
Is this how you treat your staff
in front of the customer, huh?

846
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Give it to him

847
00:45:23,401 --> 00:45:26,317
- Anything else you want, ma'am?
- 1 chicken nugget

848
00:45:26,625 --> 00:45:28,000
Your order, sir

849
00:45:32,292 --> 00:45:33,958
- 'Excuse me'
- Sir?

850
00:45:41,942 --> 00:45:44,526
Would he have done this if he was
even the least bit responsible?

851
00:45:44,567 --> 00:45:46,401
Don't keep fretting about it

852
00:45:47,301 --> 00:45:49,176
You are anyway leaving
for Canada very soon

853
00:45:49,210 --> 00:45:51,085
Why do you want to fret and fume?

854
00:45:51,142 --> 00:45:53,586
Don't worry about anything
It will all work out fine

855
00:45:53,650 --> 00:45:55,149
How are you going home?

856
00:45:56,041 --> 00:45:58,375
Hey! I'm talking to you
How are you going home?

857
00:45:59,284 --> 00:46:01,742
- I'll take an auto
- Go home safe

858
00:46:01,791 --> 00:46:03,000
I'm leaving now

859
00:46:03,377 --> 00:46:05,252
Going to a temple
 in the morning with Prakash

860
00:46:05,292 --> 00:46:07,041
- He will yell if I'm late
- Okay

861
00:46:29,583 --> 00:46:32,874
'The customer you are calling
is unable to take your call right now'

862
00:46:32,916 --> 00:46:33,916
'Please try after some-'

863
00:46:38,458 --> 00:46:39,833
Not leaving, akka?

864
00:46:40,790 --> 00:46:43,166
- I'll go in a bit
- Okay, I'm leaving, bye

865
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:49,284
Charles

866
00:46:51,542 --> 00:46:52,583
Hey Charles

867
00:46:53,161 --> 00:46:54,662
Did you want this shirt?

868
00:46:57,500 --> 00:46:58,542
Where are you now?

869
00:46:58,583 --> 00:47:00,250
'I am still in the Hub'

870
00:47:00,292 --> 00:47:02,208
Hey! It's 11:45

871
00:47:02,250 --> 00:47:03,790
What are you doing there still?

872
00:47:03,865 --> 00:47:06,949
My dad hasn't spoken
a single word to me

873
00:47:08,916 --> 00:47:11,083
I don't know how I'll face him, akka

874
00:47:11,293 --> 00:47:13,085
He's your father, right?

875
00:47:13,126 --> 00:47:14,918
What's the problem in facing him?

876
00:47:15,176 --> 00:47:17,551
I don't feel like going home

877
00:47:17,701 --> 00:47:20,782
Don't be an idiot
Go home now

878
00:47:23,324 --> 00:47:24,824
He won't yell at you

879
00:47:24,874 --> 00:47:26,292
Things will get ironed out

880
00:47:26,333 --> 00:47:27,750
Go home right now

881
00:47:27,824 --> 00:47:29,283
Hmmm...okay, akka

882
00:47:29,325 --> 00:47:31,908
Dude, her dad has the gall to ask me
'Have you got yourself tested?!'

883
00:47:31,942 --> 00:47:34,234
You know my grandfather had 12 children

884
00:47:34,292 --> 00:47:35,375
In that-

885
00:47:36,709 --> 00:47:37,791
Bought everything?

886
00:47:37,833 --> 00:47:39,833
Soda sponsored by the company
All good, let's go

887
00:47:39,874 --> 00:47:41,250
Hey! Shall we take some chicken?

888
00:47:41,292 --> 00:47:43,125
Will any human eat this?
Chee! Come

889
00:47:43,292 --> 00:47:44,916
My father has 7 children
I have 6 siblings

890
00:47:44,958 --> 00:47:46,292
Where do I keep this stock, sir?

891
00:47:46,333 --> 00:47:48,000
Keep it there, Ramajayam

892
00:47:50,041 --> 00:47:52,874
He is doubting my virility!

893
00:47:52,958 --> 00:47:55,458
What is my family's depth?
If we start making-

894
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:57,563
Hey! Where are you off to?

895
00:47:57,609 --> 00:47:59,734
- We are leaving-
- Keep this stock inside

896
00:48:00,791 --> 00:48:02,709
Will your father come
to keep this inside?

897
00:48:02,750 --> 00:48:04,542
I asked if your father
is joining here tomorrow?

898
00:48:04,593 --> 00:48:05,842
Keep it in and then go

899
00:48:10,726 --> 00:48:11,850
'Thank you'

900
00:48:12,208 --> 00:48:13,709
Please keep this in the freezer

901
00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:15,250
- We have to go
- No, da

902
00:48:15,292 --> 00:48:17,458
- Please...please...please
- It's already late

903
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:18,833
Please, akka

904
00:48:18,916 --> 00:48:20,500
Please do us this favor

905
00:48:22,333 --> 00:48:23,667
Give it fast

906
00:48:24,292 --> 00:48:26,000
'Hurry up, dude'

907
00:48:26,667 --> 00:48:28,333
Hey! We forgot to punch out

908
00:48:28,791 --> 00:48:30,833
Aiyo! Press fast

909
00:48:30,874 --> 00:48:32,375
'Thank you'

910
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:35,890
Even if that man stops us,
turn a deaf ear, just scoot

911
00:48:36,166 --> 00:48:39,417
- What does our Siddha guru say?
- Didn't say anything, sir

912
00:48:39,458 --> 00:48:40,791
We kept everything inside

913
00:48:41,375 --> 00:48:42,667
Er...go...go

914
00:48:42,726 --> 00:48:46,142
What I'm saying is
marital bond is an ocean

915
00:48:46,310 --> 00:48:48,310
You have to dive deep
to take out the pearls!

916
00:49:01,511 --> 00:49:02,719
How many you know?

917
00:49:02,766 --> 00:49:04,351
How many aphrodisiacs
I bought for her?

918
00:49:04,416 --> 00:49:05,708
But she hasn't touched them!

919
00:49:08,709 --> 00:49:12,375
Even if she is my wife, I shouldn't
touch her if she isn't interested it seems

920
00:49:12,542 --> 00:49:14,333
No means 'no' I believe, huh?

921
00:49:19,167 --> 00:49:20,166
No way, da

922
00:49:20,250 --> 00:49:22,667
She will simply be following
social distancing all the time!

923
00:49:22,916 --> 00:49:24,916
You know what distance
she maintains happily?

924
00:49:25,458 --> 00:49:28,333
Cha! Without her even hearing
the door being locked the other night

925
00:49:28,375 --> 00:49:30,458
I tiptoed into the room silently

926
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:32,375
She said, 'Chee! Get out'

927
00:49:32,583 --> 00:49:34,166
She doesn't watch web series

928
00:49:34,333 --> 00:49:35,542
Only TV serials!

929
00:49:47,542 --> 00:49:50,916
The other day, listen, dude,
we planned to go on our honeymoon

930
00:49:51,208 --> 00:49:52,458
Guess what happened?

931
00:49:55,125 --> 00:49:56,750
Her entire family landed up!

932
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,667
She coolly said
you be here, I'll be there

933
00:49:58,709 --> 00:50:00,125
Imagine how I would've felt

934
00:50:03,208 --> 00:50:04,542
Be on the line

935
00:50:26,317 --> 00:50:28,234
Wait, dude
I'll punch out and come

936
00:50:28,583 --> 00:50:32,125
I take her out for a candle light dinner
She asks for the lights to be turned on!

937
00:50:34,292 --> 00:50:35,417
Worst!

938
00:50:36,250 --> 00:50:38,790
Aiyo! No way will she agree to all that

939
00:51:07,041 --> 00:51:09,083
Sir...sir

940
00:51:10,583 --> 00:51:11,833
Hello?

941
00:51:11,874 --> 00:51:13,125
Hello, sir

942
00:51:16,333 --> 00:51:17,916
Yes, I've just left now

943
00:51:19,083 --> 00:51:20,750
Sir, please

944
00:51:26,125 --> 00:51:28,000
Sir...please, sir

945
00:51:31,667 --> 00:51:33,166
Where was I?

946
00:51:36,250 --> 00:51:37,375
Hello!

947
00:51:41,667 --> 00:51:43,790
Sir...hello

948
00:52:06,458 --> 00:52:07,417
Sir

949
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,874
Sir...please

950
00:52:17,417 --> 00:52:19,208
Hel-lo...!

951
00:52:31,735 --> 00:52:34,362
Bro, hasn't Anbu come home as yet?

952
00:52:34,504 --> 00:52:35,629
Not yet

953
00:52:35,670 --> 00:52:38,211
Sometimes her shift changes

954
00:52:38,790 --> 00:52:40,208
She should be home soon

955
00:53:15,750 --> 00:53:16,750
'Sir'

956
00:53:17,528 --> 00:53:19,984
Sir, any luggage to be kept in?

957
00:53:32,583 --> 00:53:34,000
'Get in...get in'

958
00:53:52,417 --> 00:53:54,750
Prakash, can't you hear
my mobile ringing?

959
00:53:57,667 --> 00:53:58,790
Yes, uncle

960
00:54:00,226 --> 00:54:01,892
Anbu hasn't come home as yet?

961
00:54:02,250 --> 00:54:05,041
I left work a bit early

962
00:54:05,625 --> 00:54:08,166
I'll ask the other boys
and call you back, uncle

963
00:54:08,916 --> 00:54:11,542
She was in the pantry when I left, akka

964
00:54:12,395 --> 00:54:14,187
Ask Gopi or Sannath

965
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,000
Okay

966
00:54:16,041 --> 00:54:17,458
Akka, we left earlier

967
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:19,125
Anbu left only after we did

968
00:54:19,166 --> 00:54:22,000
Manager was there
Why don't you call him?

969
00:54:22,833 --> 00:54:24,791
Okay, da
I'll call sir

970
00:54:24,833 --> 00:54:25,726
Okay...okay

971
00:54:25,767 --> 00:54:27,351
- Dear, then tomorrow?
- Shut up and go

972
00:54:27,393 --> 00:54:28,393
Okay, dear

973
00:54:28,458 --> 00:54:29,790
I was just clarifying!

974
00:54:32,250 --> 00:54:33,250
Why me?

975
00:54:36,417 --> 00:54:37,709
Sir?

976
00:54:38,417 --> 00:54:40,542
- Has Anbu punched out?
- Listen

977
00:54:40,609 --> 00:54:42,276
She has punched out and gone

978
00:54:42,310 --> 00:54:44,060
I've also punched out and come

979
00:54:44,109 --> 00:54:45,609
- Then, sir-
- Then what?

980
00:54:45,659 --> 00:54:47,659
I'll be twiddling my thumbs
lying on the sofa, huh?

981
00:54:47,711 --> 00:54:49,670
As if you tell me before you leave?

982
00:54:49,703 --> 00:54:50,953
'Do I need this?'

983
00:54:51,150 --> 00:54:52,775
I know only one word!

984
00:54:53,333 --> 00:54:54,333
Tomorrow!!

985
00:54:54,583 --> 00:54:55,667
Hello, uncle

986
00:54:56,813 --> 00:54:59,023
Manager said she left the Hub

987
00:54:59,333 --> 00:55:00,417
Is that so?

988
00:55:06,041 --> 00:55:07,125
Alright

989
00:55:07,958 --> 00:55:09,208
Okay

990
00:55:30,916 --> 00:55:34,583
'The person you are calling is
not answering, please try later'

991
00:57:40,166 --> 00:57:42,083
Pleeease!

992
00:58:06,125 --> 00:58:07,790
Please

993
00:58:16,125 --> 00:58:18,041
[banging]

994
00:58:22,250 --> 00:58:24,208
[muffled banging]

995
00:58:41,417 --> 00:58:42,500
Please

996
00:58:45,125 --> 00:58:47,709
Dad, I can hear a banging noise here

997
00:58:49,208 --> 00:58:51,166
I came with my son
for the theater experience

998
00:58:51,208 --> 00:58:52,833
My son is calling me

999
00:58:53,375 --> 00:58:54,750
What is it?

1000
00:58:54,958 --> 00:58:57,500
Dad, I can hear some banging noise inside

1001
00:58:57,542 --> 00:59:00,874
You can't hear any sound
in a locked shop

1002
00:59:24,333 --> 00:59:26,083
[banging noise]

1003
01:00:24,790 --> 01:00:27,583
'The customer you are calling is not-'

1004
01:05:54,458 --> 01:05:55,583
Vanakkam, sir

1005
01:05:57,874 --> 01:05:58,958
Sir

1006
01:05:59,476 --> 01:06:00,685
You, huh?

1007
01:06:01,874 --> 01:06:03,750
Just as I said yesterday
you proved me right

1008
01:06:04,749 --> 01:06:06,499
My tongue is known for jinxing!

1009
01:06:06,567 --> 01:06:09,067
- What happened?
- His daughter didn't get back home

1010
01:06:09,116 --> 01:06:10,781
I thought as much

1011
01:06:11,790 --> 01:06:13,790
You must have given her
a thrashing after going home

1012
01:06:13,833 --> 01:06:16,637
No, sir, nothing of that sort happened

1013
01:06:16,688 --> 01:06:18,438
I told you, sir
Voice of experience!

1014
01:06:18,542 --> 01:06:20,000
Why didn't you listen to me, sir?

1015
01:06:20,833 --> 01:06:23,916
Okay, did you call up
her usual friends' circle?

1016
01:06:24,199 --> 01:06:28,199
We've looked for her at
her class and work place

1017
01:06:28,333 --> 01:06:30,333
They claim she didn't come

1018
01:06:31,187 --> 01:06:33,062
When does she come home usually?

1019
01:06:33,125 --> 01:06:35,542
Around 12 midnight

1020
01:06:36,542 --> 01:06:37,916
Usual time is 12?

1021
01:06:37,961 --> 01:06:40,503
Sir, her work is such

1022
01:06:40,528 --> 01:06:42,612
Where does she work
to come home at midnight?

1023
01:06:42,656 --> 01:06:46,573
Sir, she works in Chicken Hub in Grand Mall

1024
01:06:47,396 --> 01:06:48,896
That boy who was here yesterday

1025
01:06:49,542 --> 01:06:50,542
Did you ask him?

1026
01:06:50,583 --> 01:06:53,208
Sir, that is...not necessary

1027
01:06:53,458 --> 01:06:56,833
Girls nowadays looks at
photos in Instagram

1028
01:06:56,874 --> 01:06:59,250
Few videos in Tik-tok and elope happily

1029
01:06:59,292 --> 01:07:01,682
My daughter isn't like that, sir

1030
01:07:01,735 --> 01:07:03,778
Don't be so overconfident

1031
01:07:03,881 --> 01:07:05,590
First go and find out
where the boy is

1032
01:07:05,625 --> 01:07:07,625
We are here to register
 a complaint, sir

1033
01:07:07,661 --> 01:07:10,742
Yov! Don't I know to accept a complaint?
Didn't you hear a word I said?

1034
01:07:10,791 --> 01:07:13,041
You'll come back here
and say she's married

1035
01:07:13,083 --> 01:07:15,583
'You'll want to withdraw the complaint
and give us a hard time?'

1036
01:07:15,625 --> 01:07:18,166
Is this our profession?
Are we running a matrimonial site?

1037
01:07:19,208 --> 01:07:21,667
Go and ask him first
Do as I say

1038
01:07:24,750 --> 01:07:27,667
By now she would have married
that boy and made out with him

1039
01:07:27,958 --> 01:07:30,833
- 'What's the use of coming now?'
-  Ignore him, let's go

1040
01:07:30,874 --> 01:07:32,333
Call him and find out

1041
01:07:32,375 --> 01:07:35,125
His phone will be switched off
Go directly to his house

1042
01:07:35,333 --> 01:07:36,625
Sir, this complaint-

1043
01:07:36,654 --> 01:07:38,903
What is it, man?
You get a pen and paper-

1044
01:07:40,041 --> 01:07:41,208
Keep it aside

1045
01:07:42,833 --> 01:07:43,790
You there!

1046
01:07:44,635 --> 01:07:46,051
I'm talking to you

1047
01:07:46,109 --> 01:07:47,817
Go and attend to your work

1048
01:07:48,874 --> 01:07:50,625
Sticking like a leech

1049
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,083
Look at you!

1050
01:07:54,916 --> 01:07:56,375
Phone is switched off

1051
01:07:56,417 --> 01:07:58,583
Hasn't the constable texted
his address to your phone?

1052
01:07:58,667 --> 01:08:00,375
Let's go to his house

1053
01:08:00,417 --> 01:08:02,417
Raghava, I know my daughter
Anbu wouldn't have eloped

1054
01:08:02,458 --> 01:08:04,750
I agree, I'm not saying
we should go and confront

1055
01:08:04,790 --> 01:08:06,874
If we go directly and ask
we may get some information

1056
01:08:06,916 --> 01:08:07,916
Let's go

1057
01:08:49,874 --> 01:08:52,375
- May I know who you are?
- We called Charles several times

1058
01:08:52,417 --> 01:08:54,375
His phone is switched off

1059
01:08:54,417 --> 01:08:56,041
We came to see him in person

1060
01:08:56,083 --> 01:08:57,874
He isn't here

1061
01:08:59,324 --> 01:09:00,865
Would you like to come in?

1062
01:09:01,125 --> 01:09:02,833
No, it's alright

1063
01:09:02,874 --> 01:09:04,417
Where has he gone?

1064
01:09:04,458 --> 01:09:07,333
He left for Hyderabad tonight

1065
01:09:07,375 --> 01:09:09,833
Did he tell you anything
before he left?

1066
01:09:09,874 --> 01:09:12,842
No, he didn't
Is there any problem?

1067
01:09:12,876 --> 01:09:14,960
Not specifically

1068
01:09:15,458 --> 01:09:19,041
If he calls you
ask him to contact this #

1069
01:09:21,790 --> 01:09:23,125
[mobile ringing]

1070
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:27,874
Whom should I say came?

1071
01:09:28,208 --> 01:09:30,292
Tell him, Anbu's father Sivam
wanted to meet him

1072
01:09:30,333 --> 01:09:31,458
He will know

1073
01:10:11,166 --> 01:10:12,542
Nothing serious, dear

1074
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:15,333
Only a minor dislocation

1075
01:10:16,041 --> 01:10:17,958
Don't be scared
You will be fine

1076
01:10:42,542 --> 01:10:44,125
Did you get any information, uncle?

1077
01:10:44,166 --> 01:10:47,208
No, Charles phone is also switched off

1078
01:10:47,709 --> 01:10:51,000
Anbu said he had got a job
in Hyderabad and was leaving tonight

1079
01:10:52,596 --> 01:10:54,512
- He's the one calling
- Answer

1080
01:10:55,750 --> 01:10:57,790
Hello...hello

1081
01:10:57,874 --> 01:10:58,874
Hello

1082
01:10:59,695 --> 01:11:00,735
Disconnected

1083
01:11:00,790 --> 01:11:01,916
Try his # again

1084
01:11:10,644 --> 01:11:11,874
Where is my daughter, da?

1085
01:11:11,916 --> 01:11:13,833
Sir, I don't know

1086
01:11:17,416 --> 01:11:19,873
- Where is my daughter?
- I swear I don't know

1087
01:11:19,916 --> 01:11:21,083
Tell me the truth

1088
01:11:21,125 --> 01:11:22,083
He knows

1089
01:11:22,125 --> 01:11:23,458
- Siva
- Tell me

1090
01:11:23,500 --> 01:11:24,458
Siva, stop it

1091
01:11:24,500 --> 01:11:26,874
- No, he knows everything
- Let's be calm and talk it over

1092
01:11:26,920 --> 01:11:28,171
'He is hiding something'

1093
01:11:29,773 --> 01:11:31,525
Even if I wasn't talking to her

1094
01:11:31,551 --> 01:11:34,593
...my Anbu gave me her usual
'missed' call as reminder tonight

1095
01:11:35,242 --> 01:11:37,492
He has brainwashed her somehow

1096
01:11:37,542 --> 01:11:39,625
Uncle, please, nothing drastic
would've happened to her

1097
01:11:39,670 --> 01:11:40,670
I'll talk to him

1098
01:11:40,726 --> 01:11:41,726
I'll ask him

1099
01:11:42,833 --> 01:11:44,874
Where is Anbu?
What has happened?

1100
01:11:44,916 --> 01:11:46,458
Aiyo! I swear I don't know

1101
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:49,250
I've called her repeatedly
She didn't pick my calls at all

1102
01:11:49,293 --> 01:11:50,918
She comes with you always, right?

1103
01:11:51,417 --> 01:11:53,458
I left home early tonight

1104
01:11:53,500 --> 01:11:55,660
Gopi says Anbu left
only after he left

1105
01:11:55,693 --> 01:11:56,774
I called the manager

1106
01:11:56,816 --> 01:11:58,709
He says she punched out and left

1107
01:11:58,750 --> 01:12:01,083
Sivam, somehow I don't trust that boy

1108
01:12:01,813 --> 01:12:04,356
Best idea is to take him
with us to the police station

1109
01:12:04,500 --> 01:12:06,125
Get into our car

1110
01:13:40,709 --> 01:13:43,083
- What, man?
- 'That girl who is missing'

1111
01:13:43,125 --> 01:13:45,041
Sir, her people have come to the station

1112
01:13:45,083 --> 01:13:47,790
Her father has...traced the boy, sir

1113
01:13:47,813 --> 01:13:50,189
But that girl isn't with the boy, sir

1114
01:13:52,210 --> 01:13:53,834
Tell them I'll take 1 hour to return

1115
01:13:54,583 --> 01:13:57,000
'It will be too late, sir?'

1116
01:13:57,041 --> 01:13:58,333
You are in the next street and-

1117
01:13:58,375 --> 01:14:01,166
'Does your name mean 'good pearl'
or good-for-nothing pearl?'

1118
01:14:01,208 --> 01:14:02,874
'Are you working
for the Govt or them?'

1119
01:14:02,916 --> 01:14:05,417
- How much bribe did you take?
- Let me talk to him

1120
01:14:06,250 --> 01:14:10,583
'Sir, you said you'll accept a complaint
only after we trace the boy and ask him'

1121
01:14:10,625 --> 01:14:12,500
I'm here now with that boy

1122
01:14:12,542 --> 01:14:15,790
You are talking without an iota
of responsibility whatsoever

1123
01:14:16,083 --> 01:14:18,874
What happened to your responsibility
in raising your daughter properly?

1124
01:14:18,916 --> 01:14:20,583
You are questioning me, huh?

1125
01:14:21,088 --> 01:14:22,630
It will take an hour
for me to come

1126
01:14:22,791 --> 01:14:25,791
He's a half baked idiot
This is so typical of him

1127
01:14:25,833 --> 01:14:28,958
Whomever you called on the phone
go and enquire in person

1128
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,916
Friends generally won't tell you
the truth over the phone

1129
01:14:31,958 --> 01:14:34,790
Sir, Anbu would never go away
 like this without informing

1130
01:14:35,098 --> 01:14:38,015
Don't you dare vouch for her now
You are the root cause of all this mess

1131
01:19:36,449 --> 01:19:40,366
She was off mood this morning
when she spoke to me, uncle

1132
01:19:40,417 --> 01:19:42,208
I asked her what had upset her

1133
01:19:42,250 --> 01:19:44,542
But she didn't tell me anything, uncle

1134
01:19:44,583 --> 01:19:46,790
'Uncle, any problem?'

1135
01:19:46,833 --> 01:19:48,417
'I tried calling her this evening'

1136
01:19:48,458 --> 01:19:50,166
'But she didn't pick my call'

1137
01:19:50,242 --> 01:19:51,742
I'll call you back

1138
01:19:51,790 --> 01:19:53,667
Give me that phone

1139
01:20:09,166 --> 01:20:11,500
We've asked everyone
 she is in touch with

1140
01:20:12,958 --> 01:20:15,500
I'm asking you as last resort

1141
01:20:18,625 --> 01:20:20,208
I don't care who you are

1142
01:20:20,542 --> 01:20:22,500
I just want my daughter back

1143
01:20:22,542 --> 01:20:26,083
Listen, if Anbu is with you 24x7
only because she wants to marry you

1144
01:20:26,125 --> 01:20:28,375
I will perform that damn wed-

1145
01:20:28,417 --> 01:20:30,125
I'll get you both married

1146
01:20:30,166 --> 01:20:33,790
Please show my daughter to me

1147
01:20:34,070 --> 01:20:36,735
In your anger, you don't know
what you are saying, sir

1148
01:20:37,790 --> 01:20:40,833
Anbu told me she will marry me
only after she repays all your debts

1149
01:20:41,833 --> 01:20:45,916
Will such a girl forget you in one night
and come away with me, huh?

1150
01:20:47,790 --> 01:20:49,333
You were the one who said

1151
01:20:50,250 --> 01:20:51,625
Even if you weren't talking to her

1152
01:20:51,667 --> 01:20:54,000
She gave you a 'missed' call
as reminder to take your pills

1153
01:20:55,083 --> 01:20:57,790
Sir, even when she meets me
and I tell her to go after 10 minutes

1154
01:20:57,833 --> 01:21:00,083
...she'll say her dad will worry
 and leave in a hurry, sir

1155
01:21:01,458 --> 01:21:04,625
She would have never dreamt
we would meet in such a situation

1156
01:21:05,790 --> 01:21:06,874
Sorry, sir

1157
01:21:07,542 --> 01:21:10,583
I didn't expect last night
to end on that note, sir

1158
01:21:12,041 --> 01:21:14,542
We are looking for her
at the wrong place, sir

1159
01:21:14,791 --> 01:21:16,706
God knows where
and what fix she is-

1160
01:21:20,918 --> 01:21:22,750
We've looked in all the places
you asked us to

1161
01:21:22,790 --> 01:21:24,166
Anbu is nowhere to be found

1162
01:21:25,292 --> 01:21:26,417
'Hello?'

1163
01:21:27,583 --> 01:21:28,667
Yes, sir

1164
01:21:28,976 --> 01:21:30,726
I'll come immediately, sir

1165
01:21:30,750 --> 01:21:32,790
Let's go, that call
was from the station

1166
01:21:38,724 --> 01:21:41,916
Raghava, Anbu gets a call
ever so often from a girl

1167
01:21:41,958 --> 01:21:43,125
'Who?'

1168
01:21:43,166 --> 01:21:44,375
Her name is-

1169
01:21:44,625 --> 01:21:45,750
Diana

1170
01:21:45,790 --> 01:21:47,166
If we know who Diana is-

1171
01:21:48,166 --> 01:21:49,958
Do you know that Diana?

1172
01:21:50,874 --> 01:21:52,041
Sir...?

1173
01:21:52,751 --> 01:21:54,294
I am Diana

1174
01:22:00,411 --> 01:22:01,411
Go

1175
01:25:17,333 --> 01:25:21,709
"The Gods are by your side herein
O' girl, stand with strength from within"

1176
01:25:21,774 --> 01:25:25,234
"Your courage will stand in good stead
for you to survive instead"

1177
01:25:25,833 --> 01:25:30,000
"Guts and grit in your heart in tow
Your eyes are as sharp as Arjuna's bow"

1178
01:25:30,051 --> 01:25:34,176
"Your mind's will and intelligence
will be a fortress wall of defense"

1179
01:25:38,958 --> 01:25:43,041
"Don't succumb to pressure and fall down
like a bamboo that bends to the ground"

1180
01:25:43,083 --> 01:25:48,292
"Against all odds, step by step
like a ladder rise to the top"

1181
01:25:49,417 --> 01:25:53,709
"Make the smallest particle a pillar
to ensure safety from this disaster"

1182
01:25:53,790 --> 01:25:59,375
"When sorrows start to drizzle
the sky will never fall in any debacle"

1183
01:26:20,417 --> 01:26:22,625
She will go home direct
after work usually

1184
01:26:22,667 --> 01:26:25,041
Something must have happened
en route mall to her place, sir

1185
01:26:25,125 --> 01:26:29,375
If we call cyber cell, they can
track Anbu for sure, sir

1186
01:26:29,418 --> 01:26:30,918
Her phone is ringing even now

1187
01:26:32,250 --> 01:26:33,417
Cyber cell, huh?

1188
01:26:34,750 --> 01:26:36,592
Why didn't I think of this?

1189
01:26:38,542 --> 01:26:39,916
Why did you come here?

1190
01:26:39,958 --> 01:26:42,100
You could have gone
directly to cyber cell, huh?

1191
01:26:42,461 --> 01:26:43,928
First give me your phone

1192
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,916
I'll decide if I should call cyber cell
or lock you up in the cell here

1193
01:26:47,750 --> 01:26:49,542
- What's your password?
- Sir

1194
01:26:49,583 --> 01:26:50,791
Anbu, sir

1195
01:26:51,500 --> 01:26:53,542
Looks like you'll change
your password often

1196
01:26:55,166 --> 01:26:57,667
So many calls
from the morning

1197
01:26:58,709 --> 01:27:00,500
You've sketched a plan brilliantly

1198
01:27:01,177 --> 01:27:03,125
Tell me this, look like
she called you repeatedly

1199
01:27:03,166 --> 01:27:04,583
Why didn't you pick her call?

1200
01:27:04,627 --> 01:27:06,001
I was leaving for Hyderabad, sir

1201
01:27:06,036 --> 01:27:10,994
You were leaving, suddenly got enlightened
and started searching high and low for her?

1202
01:27:11,083 --> 01:27:13,208
I saw his 'missed' call in my phone

1203
01:27:13,260 --> 01:27:15,260
That's why I came back immediately

1204
01:27:15,286 --> 01:27:16,953
You are a seasoned lover boy

1205
01:27:18,083 --> 01:27:20,083
You must have been
fast with your moves

1206
01:27:20,790 --> 01:27:23,625
That girl would have said
we'll wait till we are married

1207
01:27:23,667 --> 01:27:24,833
You would have taken her-

1208
01:27:24,874 --> 01:27:25,874
Sir

1209
01:27:26,458 --> 01:27:28,542
I don't think that boy
did anything wrong

1210
01:27:28,583 --> 01:27:30,375
So does the fault lie
 with your daughter?

1211
01:27:31,458 --> 01:27:33,542
Allow me to investigate properly, sir

1212
01:27:34,874 --> 01:27:36,709
Nagging me over the phone

1213
01:27:37,208 --> 01:27:39,333
You roam around with
 the accused under your armpit!

1214
01:27:39,375 --> 01:27:40,333
Sit down

1215
01:27:41,364 --> 01:27:42,750
I'm standing anyway

1216
01:27:43,750 --> 01:27:45,542
Will he blurt out everything
in front of you?

1217
01:27:50,554 --> 01:27:51,596
Okay

1218
01:27:52,625 --> 01:27:53,750
Where is the girl?

1219
01:27:53,790 --> 01:27:55,333
Sir, I really don't know

1220
01:27:55,635 --> 01:27:58,051
Is she alive or-

1221
01:27:58,817 --> 01:28:02,125
I know what you would
have done with that girl

1222
01:28:02,231 --> 01:28:03,625
Better cough up the truth

1223
01:28:03,667 --> 01:28:05,958
Your plan is to upload
 the video...how is it?

1224
01:28:06,309 --> 01:28:07,833
Just you or your friends pitched-

1225
01:28:07,874 --> 01:28:09,583
Sir, don't let your tongue run

1226
01:28:09,627 --> 01:28:11,460
How dare you speak to me like that?

1227
01:28:11,518 --> 01:28:13,685
- Sir...sir
- Mind your business

1228
01:28:16,488 --> 01:28:19,071
You party only to get the girl drunk
and have fun with her, right?

1229
01:28:19,693 --> 01:28:20,900
I won't blame you fully

1230
01:28:20,958 --> 01:28:23,292
You wouldn't have made your move
without her angling for it

1231
01:28:23,335 --> 01:28:26,543
So should we be on night duty
if she sends the wrong signals?

1232
01:28:26,667 --> 01:28:29,583
Should we be here
on night duty?

1233
01:28:30,709 --> 01:28:33,125
If you utter one more word
maligning my daughter's morals

1234
01:28:33,166 --> 01:28:35,250
...I'll disregard the fact
you are a police officer

1235
01:28:35,427 --> 01:28:39,052
We come here asking for help
only because we don't know anything

1236
01:28:39,083 --> 01:28:41,208
You are asking us
all the questions and-

1237
01:28:41,276 --> 01:28:42,734
Hey! What's all this ruckus about?

1238
01:28:42,775 --> 01:28:44,025
Ravi, what's the problem?

1239
01:28:44,075 --> 01:28:46,908
I was investigating the case
and this old man is hitting me, sir

1240
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:48,041
What is the matter?

1241
01:28:48,083 --> 01:28:51,286
Sir, it's more than 3 hours
since my daughter went missing

1242
01:28:51,333 --> 01:28:52,625
He hasn't taken any action

1243
01:28:52,667 --> 01:28:54,375
He isn't even willing to
register my complaint

1244
01:28:54,417 --> 01:28:58,375
All we did was suggest he calls up
the cyber cell to inform them

1245
01:28:58,442 --> 01:28:59,864
He is bashing up this boy

1246
01:28:59,916 --> 01:29:02,041
- Didn't you take their complaint?
- No, sir

1247
01:29:02,083 --> 01:29:04,417
- If I interrogate this bo-
- Did you call cyber cell?

1248
01:29:04,833 --> 01:29:07,166
What is your problem
in calling the cyber cell?

1249
01:29:07,208 --> 01:29:08,166
Why didn't you call?

1250
01:29:08,750 --> 01:29:10,583
Did you try to call that girl?

1251
01:29:10,625 --> 01:29:13,000
Sir, her phone rings fully and
gets automatically disconnected

1252
01:29:13,041 --> 01:29:14,333
Both of you come with me

1253
01:29:14,958 --> 01:29:17,750
You will track that phone
and tell me as soon as possible

1254
01:29:17,790 --> 01:29:19,083
Understood?

1255
01:30:41,709 --> 01:30:43,375
- 'She has left, sir
- Is that so?

1256
01:30:43,417 --> 01:30:44,874
'I am sure she left, sir'

1257
01:30:44,958 --> 01:30:46,667
'I even checked the punch out list'

1258
01:30:46,726 --> 01:30:48,976
Send that punched out list
to this number immediately

1259
01:30:54,667 --> 01:30:57,916
Sir, punch out list shows
your daughter left the work place

1260
01:30:57,969 --> 01:31:00,135
She has left the shop

1261
01:31:01,409 --> 01:31:03,242
Does she have any problem with anyone?

1262
01:31:03,294 --> 01:31:05,169
Not now, I mean generally

1263
01:31:05,237 --> 01:31:06,195
'No, sir'

1264
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,566
As far as I know
nothing of that sort, sir

hassle Anbu often, sir

1266

- Which auto stand?
- 'The one in front of the mall, sir'

1267
01:31:14,417 --> 01:31:16,292
- Can you identify him?
- Yes, sir

1268
01:31:16,333 --> 01:31:17,709
Let's go and find him

1269
01:31:17,750 --> 01:31:20,166
Inform all the stations about that girl

1270
01:31:20,208 --> 01:31:21,874
Get into the car, sir
I'll follow

1271
01:31:21,958 --> 01:31:24,583
Send that girl's photo also
to all the police stations

1272
01:31:24,625 --> 01:31:27,083
Did you get any information
from the cyber cell?

1273
01:31:27,250 --> 01:31:28,250
No, sir

1274
01:31:28,292 --> 01:31:30,750
As soon as you get any information
intimate me, understand?

1275
01:31:31,250 --> 01:31:32,208
Okay, sir

only after he left'

01:32:15,833 --> 01:32:17,292
Do you remember that auto driver?

1285
01:32:17,333 --> 01:32:18,874
- Yes
- Go and identify him

1286
01:32:19,709 --> 01:32:21,250
- Hold the bike

Yes, next to the water tank

01:41:03,041 --> 01:41:05,417
Drink it up, it will fill
your restless mind with peace

1399
01:42:04,817 --> 01:42:05,775
Yov!

1400
01:42:06,589 --> 01:42:07,631
Open the cell

1401
01:42:13,366 --> 01:42:15,032
How dare you act smart!

1402
01:42:15,250 --> 01:42:17,041
You'll get it from me

1403
01:42:17,083 --> 01:42:18,833
What audacity!
Asking for trouble

1404
01:42:18,874 --> 01:42:20,083
I'll smash your face

1405
01:42:20,874 --> 01:42:22,500
What do you take me for?

1406
01:42:22,583 --> 01:42:23,667
Won't you pipe down?

1407
01:42:38,790 --> 01:42:40,166
I'll skin you alive

1408
01:42:42,125 --> 01:42:43,333
Lock the door

1409
01:42:46,919 --> 01:42:47,919
Sir

1410
01:42:53,395 --> 01:42:54,437
Goodnight

1411
01:42:55,333 --> 01:42:56,625
Sir...sir

1412
01:43:00,083 --> 01:43:01,083
Sir

1413
01:43:04,117 --> 01:43:05,158
Here

1414
01:43:13,458 --> 01:43:16,667
'Don't smoke, pa'

1415
01:43:16,709 --> 01:43:18,750
She will say my health will get spoilt

1416
01:43:18,790 --> 01:43:20,833
I don't know where she is now

1417
01:43:20,874 --> 01:43:23,500
She must be safe somewhere
She'll be back, don't worry

1418
01:43:23,542 --> 01:43:25,779
Anbu's friend told me

1419
01:43:25,834 --> 01:43:29,210
She left work late because
I was not talking to her

1420
01:43:30,583 --> 01:43:33,750
I could have just yelled at her and
not given her this silent treatment

1421
01:43:34,654 --> 01:43:36,237
Why even yell at her?

1422
01:43:36,625 --> 01:43:38,333
All she did was
fall in love with this chap

1423
01:43:39,380 --> 01:43:42,922
Why did I hold this silly ego
against my own daughter?

1424
01:43:46,354 --> 01:43:51,229
If she was in some trouble
and she had called me

1425
01:43:51,333 --> 01:43:53,958
I didn't pick her call
and go to her rescue

1426
01:43:58,916 --> 01:44:01,625
- You can go
- Take the torch, bro

1427
01:44:04,125 --> 01:44:07,542
Sir, it is too late for anyone
to hang around here

Nagaraj bro
Don't say anything

1429
01:44:10,583 --> 01:44:12,916
- Why?
- His daughter is missing from evening

1430
01:44:12,958 --> 01:44:14,709
He is very upset and distraught

1431
01:44:14,762 --> 01:44:17,054
Sir, where is your daughter
working in this mall?

1433
01:44:18,208 --> 01:44:20,125
Do you have her photo on you?

1434
01:44:23,679 --> 01:44:25,929
Did you look for her
in the usual places she visits?

1435
01:44:29,520 --> 01:44:31,312
As far as I know

1436
01:44:31,346 --> 01:44:34,095
Your daughter hasn't left this mall

1437
01:44:48,125 --> 01:44:49,125
Hurry up

1438
01:44:51,958 --> 01:44:53,041
Fast...fast

1439
01:44:55,458 --> 01:44:56,542
Make it fast

1440
01:45:28,260 --> 01:45:29,635
Give me the torch

1441
01:45:31,889 --> 01:45:34,185
- Where's the key?
- Sir, manager has it

1442
01:45:34,230 --> 01:45:35,904
Go and get it from him

1443
01:46:46,764 --> 01:46:48,640
- What are you doing here?
- What, sir?

1444
01:46:48,681 --> 01:46:50,139
What are you watching?

1445
01:46:50,181 --> 01:46:51,681
- Give me your phone

I didn't talk to her one day
She has gone without talking to me

Lift her up

01:51:51,056 --> 01:51:52,181
Lift her

1480
01:51:54,139 --> 01:51:55,556
Hurry...watch your step

1481
01:52:29,524 --> 01:52:31,024
Rest up, dear

1482
01:52:31,590 --> 01:52:32,713
Sleep for a while

1483
01:52:35,473 --> 01:52:36,724
What happened?

1484
01:52:37,139 --> 01:52:39,006
Just a minor bike accident

1485
01:52:39,441 --> 01:52:40,740
Didn't go to Hyderabad?

1486
01:52:41,227 --> 01:52:43,185
He didn't go for your sake

1487
01:52:44,640 --> 01:52:46,178
When did this happen?

1488
01:52:47,223 --> 01:52:48,514
You are both friends now?

1489
01:52:52,139 --> 01:52:54,181
He isn't one of us, pa

1490
01:52:54,223 --> 01:52:55,348
Is it okay?

1491
01:52:55,514 --> 01:52:56,931
Let it be

1492
01:53:02,407 --> 01:53:04,324
Did you think I'll die, pa?

1493
01:53:04,907 --> 01:53:05,907
Chee!

1494
01:53:08,365 --> 01:53:11,115
I won't leave you and
go anywhere, pa

1495
01:53:12,040 --> 01:53:13,582
Not even Canada?

1496
01:53:16,893 --> 01:53:18,727
Hope you won't change your mind?

1497
01:53:19,805 --> 01:53:20,764
'Good'

1498
01:53:21,721 --> 01:53:23,473
Sir, you need to buy this medicine

1499
01:53:24,348 --> 01:53:25,431
- Sir, I'll go
- I'll go

1500
01:53:27,431 --> 01:53:28,431
Go

1501
01:53:30,348 --> 01:53:31,640

Isn't that your name?

1504
01:53:36,157 --> 01:53:37,157
No

1505
01:53:37,306 --> 01:53:38,389
Take good care of her

1506
01:53:43,254 --> 01:53:44,920
Yov! Why didn't you
switch on the alarm?

1507
01:53:44,972 --> 01:53:46,342
I always do, sir

1508
01:53:46,389 --> 01:53:47,764
My wife will switch it off

1509
01:53:47,805 --> 01:53:49,014
It's of no use, sir

1510
01:53:49,056 --> 01:53:51,598
Hey madcap! How does it matter
if it is of any use or not to you?

1511
01:53:51,640 --> 01:53:52,951
I didn't ask about your house

1512
01:53:53,014 --> 01:53:54,640
I meant the safety alarm
in the freezer zone

1513
01:53:54,681 --> 01:53:56,598
It is under repair
I will rectify it soon, sir

1514
01:53:56,665 --> 01:53:58,241
You and your spaced out face!

1515
01:53:58,761 --> 01:54:01,428
Sir, I got that girl's
last tower location

1516
01:54:01,607 --> 01:54:03,473
Hang on that tower, jinx of a jerk!

1517
01:54:03,514 --> 01:54:05,348
'When did you send me that message?'

1518
01:54:05,391 --> 01:54:07,849
I will first have your
suspension letter typed out

1519
01:54:07,907 --> 01:54:09,907
Sir, this is a hospital

1520
01:54:10,847 --> 01:54:12,528
Idiot, hang up now

1521
01:54:23,805 --> 01:54:24,805
Sir

1522
01:54:25,052 --> 01:54:26,552
How is your daughter now?

1523
01:54:26,598 --> 01:54:28,473
She's fine now
Nothing to worry

1524
01:54:28,514 --> 01:54:29,473
I'm so glad to hear that

1525
01:54:29,514 --> 01:54:31,721
Sir, I should be the one to thank you

1526
01:54:31,805 --> 01:54:35,139
What made you think
my daughter is only in the mall?

1527
01:54:35,178 --> 01:54:38,053
I am in this same security job
for the past 30 years

1528
01:54:38,097 --> 01:54:40,721
So many faces go past me daily

1529
01:54:40,753 --> 01:54:43,379
Not one of them will look me in the eye

1530
01:54:43,616 --> 01:54:45,678
Like a society of hunchbacks

1531
01:54:45,722 --> 01:54:48,740
...everyone will be bending over
 their mobiles and walk past me

1532
01:54:49,640 --> 01:54:53,905
But only your daughter will look up
and flash her sweet smile at me

1533
01:55:08,097 --> 01:55:10,967
Last night I didn't see that smile

1534
01:55:11,681 --> 01:55:13,764
When none of the faces
 acknowledge a person

1535
01:55:14,014 --> 01:55:15,764
When one face looks him in the eye

1536
01:55:16,097 --> 01:55:17,795
How can that face be forgotten, sir?

1537
01:55:17,847 --> 01:55:20,889
Not to walk with their eyes
 buried into their mobile

1538
01:55:21,253 --> 01:55:23,253
We should teach people
to make direct eye contact

1539
01:55:23,306 --> 01:55:27,306
To survive here most people assume
 food and water will suffice

1540
01:55:28,232 --> 01:55:30,306
A little bit of love is needed
to nourish us, sir

1541
01:55:30,348 --> 01:55:31,857
It's time for my duty
Let me go, sir

1542
01:55:33,847 --> 01:55:35,139
Er...I forgot to ask you

1543
01:55:35,527 --> 01:55:36,959
What is your daughter's name?

1544
01:55:39,014 --> 01:55:41,014
