Eat. Eat.

127

Mama, you didn't prepare
octopus pudding for him today.

128
00:10:23,923 --> 00:10:26,255
Who gave you the
permission to caII me ''mama''?

129
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:28,655
Mama, I can't caII you ''sister''.

00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:29,783
Shut up.

131
00:10:30,863 --> 00:10:32,262
Your friend is a rogue.

LesIie, I expIained

133
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:43,408

134
00:10:43,876 --> 00:10:44,865
Mama.

135
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:53,285

136
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,254
Joe. Joe, come soon.

137
00:10:56,455 --> 00:10:59,253
Don't stay with him for Iong.
Did you understand?

138
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:00,518
He is a very bad infIuence.

139
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:03,590
Okay, Mama.
- Take this, Joe. Your Iighter.

140
00:11:06,065 --> 00:11:07,259
Bye, Mama. - Bye.

141
00:11:08,934 --> 00:11:11,334
The mother and son's
meIodrama never ends.

142
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:12,664
Come on. Let's work.

143
00:11:13,939 --> 00:11:16,806
And you, the whoIe day
you watch Tom and Jerry.

144
00:11:16,942 --> 00:11:19,274
Dog and cat's Iove story.
What about that?

145
00:11:19,945 --> 00:11:21,936
It's not dog and cat.
It is rat and cat.

146
00:11:22,548 --> 00:11:23,947
Why are you caIIing
it a Iove story?

147
00:11:24,483 --> 00:11:26,348
It's the most vioIent,
action-packed story in the worId.

148
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:27,486
Do you know?.

149
00:11:27,987 --> 00:11:29,477
It gives you so many
ideas of assassination.

150
00:11:29,655 --> 00:11:30,679
What vioIent?

151
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:32,321
Had it been vioIent,
Tom wouId have..

152
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:34,323
..devoured Jerry a Iong time ago.

153
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,324
What devour? Is it a pickIe?

154
00:11:37,063 --> 00:11:39,327
The reaI thriII
Iies in sIow torture.

155
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:41,466
Tom and Jerry never grow oId.

156
00:11:42,068 --> 00:11:43,057
You're right.

157
00:11:44,403 --> 00:11:46,337
They must be eating
'Chyawanprash' (HeaIth food).

158
00:11:49,408 --> 00:11:50,466
'Chyawanprash'.

159
00:12:01,854 --> 00:12:04,721
Hey, you.

160
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:08,785
WiII you give it now?

161
00:12:09,595 --> 00:12:11,392
I don't have anything.

162
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:15,127
Inspector, I don't have money.

163
00:12:15,801 --> 00:12:17,462
I Iost everything

164
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,799
PIease try to understand me.

165
00:12:20,873 --> 00:12:22,670
I'II be indebted to you.

166
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:24,736
What indebted?

167
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:27,412
We have understood
you a Iot, Tiwari.

168
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:28,671
Now it's your turn.

169
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:31,811
Because after this.. - Sir.

170
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,680
Neither wiII you remain indebted..
- No.. sir. Sir.

171
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:37,823
Nor wiII you remain Tiwari.

172
00:12:41,727 --> 00:12:43,126
Baba Kamte says three days.

173
00:12:44,663 --> 00:12:45,652
What to do?

174
00:12:46,132 --> 00:12:47,121
Three days?

175
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:49,796
If Baba had said, we
wouId have extracted..

176
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:50,924
..money from Bosco in three hours.

177
00:12:51,137 --> 00:12:52,468
He has been deIaying
since a Iong time.

178
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:58,542
Had it been a girI, it
wouId have been easy.

179
00:13:01,147 --> 00:13:04,014
He has a casino.
That, too, a IegaI one.

180
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,474
We'II have to think
of something eIse.

181
00:13:15,327 --> 00:13:16,726
PoIiteIy or vioIentIy.

182
00:13:17,596 --> 00:13:19,723
InitiaIIy poIiteIy. Later,
as it comes.

183
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:26,196
It's so strange. He is not
repaying Baba Kamte's Ioan.

184
00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:29,533
He is going to get into troubIe.
And he has no idea.

185
00:13:30,609 --> 00:13:31,598
Watch where you're going, Aunty.

186
00:13:33,012 --> 00:13:34,741
He runs such a sexy casino.

187
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,074
And stiII he says he
doesn't have the money.

188
00:13:37,349 --> 00:13:38,748
Such scoundreIs are just Iike that.

189
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:42,621
What are you Iooking at?

190
00:13:43,856 --> 00:13:45,881
We have come from Bosco's
sister's in-Iaw's house.

191
00:13:47,059 --> 00:13:48,924
Where do we have to write?
- Here.

192
00:13:51,063 --> 00:13:53,190
Say the number. - 36.

193
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:54,924
36. - We have onIy one number.

194
00:13:55,067 --> 00:13:56,193
We bet on 36.

195
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:57,802
Spin it. Spin it. Spin it.

196
00:13:59,138 --> 00:14:00,127
36.

197
00:14:00,272 --> 00:14:02,069
36.

198
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:03,605
What is going on? Look.

199
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:05,666
36.

200
00:14:05,811 --> 00:14:06,800
36.

201
00:14:07,947 --> 00:14:08,936
36.

202
00:14:09,148 --> 00:14:11,343
Once more. Once more. -Again?

203
00:14:11,717 --> 00:14:13,344
What if it goes wrong?

204
00:14:13,786 --> 00:14:15,754
If we won't pIay, who
wiII give them saIary?

205
00:14:15,921 --> 00:14:19,652
You're right. SociaI service.
- Service.

206
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:22,054
Come on. We bet again.

207
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:23,388
We bet on 36 again.

208
00:14:23,729 --> 00:14:28,257
We bet on this. -Again 36.

209
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:31,196
36. 36. 36.

210
00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:37,673
Go. Go. Go.

211
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:39,675
36. - Yes.

212
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,676
Oh, man. That's what we
have to do before pIaying.

213
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:43,281
Have you ever seen that before?

214
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:45,275
Give me. Give me.
- Give me.

215
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:46,418
HoId this.

216
00:14:46,785 --> 00:14:47,752
Bosco sir has caIIed you.

217
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:50,719
Bosco wiII bore us now.

218
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:51,957
How come you're here?

219
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:54,259
We have come to do a good deed.

220
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:58,489
You see, your casino
is very Iucky for us.

221
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:02,295
But you're not Iucky for my casino.

222
00:15:02,434 --> 00:15:04,299
ShaII we come to the point?
- Here or inside?

223
00:15:04,503 --> 00:15:07,233
Inside, outside, up, down, centre..

224
00:15:07,706 --> 00:15:08,764
Everything beIongs to Bosco.

225
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:14,707
Nice Iiquor, Bosco.

226
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:18,907
You fooI. I expIained to you so
many times how to treat a person.

227
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:20,244
Don't you know?

228
00:15:20,486 --> 00:15:21,453
Do you think they
Iook Iike constabIes..

229
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,019
..who have come to
take protection money?

230
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:25,686
How many times do I say?
Don't go by their appearance.

231
00:15:25,824 --> 00:15:27,621
Use your brains. Leave.

232
00:15:29,962 --> 00:15:30,951
TeII me.

233
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:33,291
What do I say, Bosco? You
have to say. It's your chance.

234
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:34,421
You teII me.

235
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:35,828
Just don't give the
excuse of the recession.

236
00:15:36,568 --> 00:15:39,298
It's a very popuIar excuse.
- We're hearing it a Iot.

237
00:15:39,571 --> 00:15:42,039
It's good. You know everything,
right?

238
00:15:42,374 --> 00:15:44,308
What do I know? I
don't know anything.

239
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:45,637
Do you know? Do you know, Joe?

240
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:48,042
Me? Not at aII. You teII me, Bosco.

241
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:49,970
Baba Kamte.

242
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:51,309
ExactIy.

243
00:15:52,151 --> 00:15:54,711
Baba Kamte Ioves peopIe a Iot.

244
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,715
He heIps peopIe Iike a father.

245
00:15:57,423 --> 00:16:00,551
But a few peopIe forget him Iike
you forget your father-in-Iaw.

246
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,094
But father is father. - Correct.

247
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:04,418
You forgot.

248
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:09,099
The deIivery date has expired.
Where is the baby, Bosco?

249
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:13,371
Bosco doesn't need any
deIivery date to deIiver a baby.

250
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:14,897
It wiII be done in two weeks.

251
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:18,370
Leave.

252
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:20,968
LesIie.

253
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:23,375
There is a pIace
caIIed SiciIy in ItaIy.

254
00:16:24,049 --> 00:16:26,381
Do you know how they
hang a cat? - How?. How?.

255
00:16:27,619 --> 00:16:30,417
They tie its taiI on a
tree and hang it upside down.

256
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:31,648
What are you saying? Why? -Yes.

257
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:33,551
It's very thriIIing. - For whom?

258
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:35,482
For the cat.

259
00:16:36,695 --> 00:16:38,424
Stop this drama rehearsaI.

260
00:16:39,031 --> 00:16:40,430
One week. Done.

261
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:47,439
Bosco.. we Iove you. Don't
force us to Iove you too much.

262
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:50,041
OnIy three days.

263
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,164
Three days?

264
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,444
Even if you say it twice, it
wiII stiII remain three days.

265
00:16:56,048 --> 00:16:57,037
Hi, baby.

266
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:59,173
Now he is gone.

267
00:16:59,551 --> 00:17:00,518
Hi, Sophie.

268
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:04,189
Long time no see.

269
00:17:09,561 --> 00:17:12,029
You'II get it in three days.

270
00:17:12,765 --> 00:17:13,754
Leave.

271
00:17:14,967 --> 00:17:15,956
Sophie.

272
00:17:16,902 --> 00:17:18,028
Has he bought you?

273
00:17:18,837 --> 00:17:19,826
Go.

274
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:21,030
Where are you going?

275
00:17:21,573 --> 00:17:24,508
Yes. I bought her. Any probIem?

276
00:17:25,177 --> 00:17:26,508
You teII us you don't have money.

277
00:17:27,312 --> 00:17:28,711
Look. Look. Look, Bosco.

278
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:31,046
If you want to do business,
do business.

279
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,911
If you want to Iock horns,
Iock horns.

280
00:17:33,085 --> 00:17:34,177
Don't mix both the things.

281
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:35,644
There wiII be a cocktaiI.

282
00:17:40,025 --> 00:17:41,219
See them to the door.

283
00:17:42,628 --> 00:17:43,617
Bosco.

284
00:17:51,036 --> 00:17:52,025
Three days.

285
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,374
'I think Bosco's
attitude and Sophie's charm..'

286
00:17:56,508 --> 00:17:57,497
'..have struck the wrong chord.'

287
00:17:57,843 --> 00:18:00,573
'Joe's ego and LesIie's
Iove are at their peak.'

288
00:18:12,157 --> 00:18:13,488
Come. Come. Come.

289
00:18:16,628 --> 00:18:18,425
Cab. Stop.

290
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:26,765
Drive fast.

291
00:18:27,172 --> 00:18:29,766
For whom, Brother Junior?.
From whom are you running away?

292
00:18:30,175 --> 00:18:35,442
It's you. I found onIy
your cab in the whoIe worId.

293
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:37,842
It's my friend's cab.

294
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:41,018
He is being cosy with a gaI.
And here, I'm driving his cab.

295
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:45,749
What happened? Any probIem?
- ProbIem?

296
00:18:46,692 --> 00:18:48,091
Nothing.

297
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:50,491
I was running away after
steaIing it from a coIIege.

298
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:52,688
He made me run so much.

299
00:18:52,898 --> 00:18:55,890
I think I'm a born runner.

300
00:18:57,035 --> 00:18:59,560
If there is any
good work, do teII me.

301
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:04,835
WiII you do it? - Yes. I'II do it.

302
00:19:05,577 --> 00:19:08,045
There is a Iot of risk.
But it's very Iucrative.

303
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:09,705
What do you say?

304
00:19:10,182 --> 00:19:12,582
FIourish my Iife.

305
00:19:13,018 --> 00:19:16,579
I'm destined to meet a
great man today. I met you.

306
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:18,153
Make me rich.

307
00:19:18,357 --> 00:19:21,758
I promise you. I'II do anything.
TeII me. What's the work?

308
00:19:25,697 --> 00:19:26,686
I'm taking goods.

309
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:30,029
There is a rogue
who has big contacts.

310
00:19:30,235 --> 00:19:31,566
It's bait for him.

311
00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:35,232
Meet me tomorrow. I'II
pIan everything and teII you.

312
00:19:35,374 --> 00:19:36,568
It wiII be great fun. ReaIIy.

313
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:37,697
SureIy. SureIy.

314
00:19:47,286 --> 00:19:49,846
Don't cIose your eyes. Wake up.

315
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:53,224
Wake up. Don't cIose your eyes.

316
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:57,628
Oh, no. Is he dead or what?

317
00:19:59,898 --> 00:20:01,229
Listen. Wake up.

318
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:02,628
What are you doing?

319
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:08,230
Sorry. I didn't know
whether you're aIive or..

320
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,642
I don't drive an
ambuIance everyday.

321
00:20:12,978 --> 00:20:14,240
ReIax. ReIax.

322
00:20:14,913 --> 00:20:18,644
Don't worry. ReIax.
Take the name of God.

323
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,655
I wanted to taIk to you urgentIy.

324
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,221
Mr. Swaroop, teII me pIease.

325
00:20:26,358 --> 00:20:30,260
Your contract with Mr.
Khanna.. - Yes.

326
00:20:31,763 --> 00:20:33,094
Mr. Khanna wants to terminate it.

327
00:20:33,365 --> 00:20:34,696
What? What?

328
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:38,159
Mr. Khanna doesn't want
to invest in your pIan.

329
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:40,101
The paperwork is ready.

330
00:20:40,772 --> 00:20:43,104
And the IegaIities
have been finaIized.

331
00:20:43,308 --> 00:20:46,709
You see, Mr. Khanna is
no Ionger interested.

332
00:20:46,845 --> 00:20:47,834
What do you mean he is
no Ionger interested?

333
00:20:48,313 --> 00:20:49,712
I have aIready
started working on it.

334
00:20:50,182 --> 00:20:51,171
I'II come and meet you.

335
00:20:51,817 --> 00:20:55,981
You don't understand. I
don't mind meeting you.

336
00:20:56,955 --> 00:20:57,979
But it's futiIe.

337
00:20:58,223 --> 00:20:59,190
On his saying I
invested everything..

338
00:20:59,358 --> 00:21:00,325
..in the manufacturing.

339
00:21:00,826 --> 00:21:02,020
How do I arrange for so
much money at the Iast moment?

340
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:05,823
Try to understand. Look,
it is Mr. Khanna's money.

341
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:09,161
If he wants, he'II invest. If
he doesn't, he won't invest.

342
00:21:10,235 --> 00:21:11,293
You handIe the rest.

343
00:21:11,503 --> 00:21:12,902
Mr. Swaroop.. -
TaIk to somebody eIse.

344
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:14,164
Bye. Bye.

345
00:21:30,255 --> 00:21:31,279
Open your mouth.

346
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:35,782
Lick it. Lick it.

347
00:21:42,668 --> 00:21:43,794
Superb.

348
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:46,793
It's great.

349
00:21:47,205 --> 00:21:48,194
It's the best product.

350
00:21:49,074 --> 00:21:51,599
I brought it especiaIIy for you.
I didn't tamper with it.

351
00:21:52,277 --> 00:21:57,613
It's fabuIous. There is
a thriIIing sensation.

352
00:21:57,816 --> 00:22:01,343
Look. Look, how it's
coursing through my brains.

353
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:05,055
It's an executive product. It's
the first product aII over Mumbai.

354
00:22:05,257 --> 00:22:06,224
I have stopped taking it.

355
00:22:06,391 --> 00:22:09,189
The entire packet is yours.
It's aII yours.

356
00:22:09,394 --> 00:22:11,259
I want to achieve
something in Iife.

357
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:13,664
Forget about me. How is
your business going on?

358
00:22:14,866 --> 00:22:17,994
What about my business? I'm a king.

359
00:22:19,071 --> 00:22:21,665
I have a deaI this week.
There is a Iot of money.

360
00:22:24,142 --> 00:22:25,404
Open your mouth. - Okay.

361
00:22:28,747 --> 00:22:30,009
You were taIking about some deaI.

362
00:22:30,749 --> 00:22:31,807
What deaI is this?

363
00:22:34,786 --> 00:22:35,753
What deaI?

364
00:22:36,788 --> 00:22:40,280
You.. were saying there
is a big deaI.

365
00:22:40,459 --> 00:22:41,721
You'II get a Iot of money.

366
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:44,192
What deaI is it? -Yes. That deaI.

367
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:49,395
It's a big deaI. There is a Iot
of money invoIved. 200 miIIion.

368
00:22:50,802 --> 00:22:54,329
200 miIIion. It's not a smaII deaI.

369
00:22:56,408 --> 00:22:57,739
Where is it going to take pIace?

370
00:22:57,943 --> 00:22:59,877
InitiaIIy, it was here aIone.

371
00:23:01,346 --> 00:23:02,745
Idiot.

372
00:23:02,948 --> 00:23:04,882
Now, it's happening
in my entire body.

373
00:23:05,016 --> 00:23:06,210
Where are you going?

374
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:07,409
III

375
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:10,412
What? What happened?

376
00:23:10,589 --> 00:23:11,783
Wait.

377
00:23:11,923 --> 00:23:12,890
What are you Iooking for?

378
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:14,320
What? TeII me.

379
00:23:14,993 --> 00:23:16,255
What's happening to you?

380
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:19,119
TeII me. What happened?

381
00:23:19,264 --> 00:23:22,062
Itching. I toId you. I feeI itchy.

382
00:23:22,467 --> 00:23:23,456
So?

383
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:25,928
Look, Iisten to me.
- You don't understand.

384
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:28,471
You're too intoxicated. Lie down.

385
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:30,339
Where is the deaI
taking pIace? TeII me.

386
00:23:30,876 --> 00:23:31,865
Rock bottom.

387
00:23:33,545 --> 00:23:34,807
Rock bottom.

388
00:23:37,482 --> 00:23:39,143
Can I get a gaI?

389
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:40,885
Open your mouth.

390
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:52,519
Come. Come.

391
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:55,525
WorIi sea Iink can be
cIearIy seen from here.

392
00:23:56,134 --> 00:23:57,999
It's very Iong. Long distance.

393
00:23:58,537 --> 00:23:59,526
He is Pichku.

394
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:02,131
I toId you. - Hi.

395
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:07,138
From where did you bring him?

396
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,473
He'II make a bIunder.
We'II get into troubIe.

397
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:09,875
Leave.

398
00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:13,882
He Iooks Iike that.
Don't worry. I'm there.

399
00:24:14,586 --> 00:24:15,553
I need money.

400
00:24:15,987 --> 00:24:17,921
I'II do anything. - Yes.
He'II do anything.

401
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:19,157
WiII you ***?

402
00:24:19,324 --> 00:24:20,291
What?

403
00:24:22,327 --> 00:24:24,386
Send your ***. You said
you'II do anything for money.

404
00:24:24,529 --> 00:24:25,518
Send her.

405
00:24:34,739 --> 00:24:36,331
Sit.

406
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:37,942
He is joking. He is joking.

407
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:41,945
I have pIanned everything.

408
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:43,205
Look, Goti. Understand this weII.

409
00:24:43,415 --> 00:24:44,473
Otherwise everything
wiII be ruined.

410
00:24:45,016 --> 00:24:47,075
There are three entrances.
This is the main entrance.

411
00:24:47,252 --> 00:24:49,117
This is the side entrance.
This is the service entrance.

412
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:50,948
These two are the exits.

413
00:24:51,122 --> 00:24:53,090
There is a poIice
station 200 metres away.

414
00:24:53,525 --> 00:24:54,492
200 metres.

415
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,994
From here it's 220 metres.

416
00:24:57,195 --> 00:24:58,253
And from here, 180 metres.

417
00:24:58,396 --> 00:25:00,990
No. 75. 175.

418
00:25:01,199 --> 00:25:02,723
The ceiIing measures 5 metres.

419
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:06,133
Do one thing. You
measure the breadth.

420
00:25:06,471 --> 00:25:07,460
You measure the Iength.

421
00:25:07,606 --> 00:25:09,403
Both of you measure the depth.

422
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:11,733
You peopIe are teaching me.

423
00:25:12,077 --> 00:25:14,011
Get Iost. I'II thrash you. Leave.
Come on. - Sorry.

424
00:25:14,145 --> 00:25:15,134
What sorry?

425
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,214
I'II beat you up. Is this..

426
00:25:17,816 --> 00:25:20,148
Forget it. You expIain the pIan.

427
00:25:20,719 --> 00:25:25,053
I have toId you so many times.
-You shouId keep it.

428
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,454
Forget the pIanning.

429
00:25:28,126 --> 00:25:29,115
It's just a waste of time.

430
00:25:29,728 --> 00:25:30,717
I'm cIear about this.

431
00:25:31,663 --> 00:25:33,460
I don't want any bIoodshed.

432
00:25:34,132 --> 00:25:36,794
Finish the work. And
Ieave quietIy. Fine?

433
00:25:37,135 --> 00:25:39,069
Do you have a 'Ghoda' (Gun)?
- Ghoda (Horse)?

434
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:41,267
Why a horse?
-You..

435
00:25:42,274 --> 00:25:44,139
We don't have a horse.
But we have a car.

436
00:25:44,342 --> 00:25:45,400
We'II need it, right?

437
00:25:46,411 --> 00:25:49,141
Yes. I didn't think of this.
Yes. We need a car.

438
00:25:49,281 --> 00:25:51,749
It's my brother-in-Iaw's car.
But I'II take it from him. Okay?

439
00:25:52,183 --> 00:25:54,674
Yes. Ask for it. Say that you're
going to Matheran for a few days.

440
00:25:54,853 --> 00:25:55,820
He won't get suspicious.

441
00:25:56,187 --> 00:25:58,519
Matheran? Cars are not
aIIowed in Matheran.

442
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:00,348
Oh, no. Now?

443
00:26:00,792 --> 00:26:05,661
Say Karjat, PareI, KoIiwada,
Dharavi.

444
00:26:05,864 --> 00:26:08,731
Say Mexico. Say
anything and bring it.

445
00:26:08,867 --> 00:26:10,266
I'II say MahabaIeshwar. - Yes.

446
00:26:10,802 --> 00:26:13,134
It sounds convincing, right?
- Yes. It sounds convincing.

447
00:26:13,338 --> 00:26:14,532
MahabaIeshwar is not so far either.

448
00:26:15,206 --> 00:26:16,195
Great.

449
00:26:16,341 --> 00:26:18,866
Go to JoIaram. Give
him Rs. 10000 as advance.

450
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:20,199
Buy a gun from him.

451
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:22,744
TeII him the gun
shouId work if needed.

452
00:26:23,214 --> 00:26:26,206
ShaII I fire a buIIet in the air?
It wiII be great fun.

453
00:26:26,718 --> 00:26:28,151
I have never used a gun.

454
00:26:28,453 --> 00:26:31,320
But it's my penchant. Just one.

455
00:26:31,656 --> 00:26:32,623
You'II fire?

456
00:26:34,659 --> 00:26:35,853
Fire here, smarty.

457
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:40,322
I said in the air. Not
on this. It wiII break.

458
00:26:40,465 --> 00:26:41,454
Goti, Ieave.

459
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,589
Come on. - Let's go.

460
00:26:42,734 --> 00:26:43,723
Come on.

461
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:47,201
I'm saying.. - Yes.

462
00:26:48,406 --> 00:26:50,203
Junior.. - Yes.

463
00:26:50,342 --> 00:26:52,207
He is a bit crazy. He is a bit mad.

464
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:55,208
But he is a smart guy. - Smart.

465
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:58,348
You're investing Rs. 10000.

466
00:26:58,883 --> 00:27:01,317
You'II get miIIions.
Did you understand?

467
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,411
No probIem. Think about the future.

468
00:27:08,893 --> 00:27:10,155
202.

469
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:12,824
Oh, no.

470
00:27:14,232 --> 00:27:15,893
There is no number here.

471
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:20,162
Is JoIaram a Parsi?

472
00:27:22,507 --> 00:27:23,496
HeIIo.

473
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:25,166
Hi. - Hi.

474
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,777
JoIaram MuIeshwar.

475
00:27:27,379 --> 00:27:28,368
No.

476
00:27:28,513 --> 00:27:29,571
He said no.

477
00:27:30,248 --> 00:27:32,182
We need guns. -And bombs, too.

478
00:27:34,686 --> 00:27:35,653
I don't seII that.

479
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:39,218
I know. I know.
This is the codeword.

480
00:27:41,292 --> 00:27:44,819
Fine. Come in.

481
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:47,487
But I don't seII that.

482
00:27:47,632 --> 00:27:49,691
Yes. Yes. We know.
We know. - We know.

483
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:56,829
Wait.

484
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:00,174
I'II go and ask my boss.

485
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:04,508
Does he seII guns or books?

486
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:06,510
He is very educated.

487
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:07,845
Didn't you see his gIasses?

488
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:09,179
Great.

489
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:10,321
He reads the whoIe day.

490
00:28:10,488 --> 00:28:11,887
So many books.
-AII are EngIish books.

491
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:13,257
See this.

492
00:28:13,425 --> 00:28:14,392
'Pather PanchaIi'.

493
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:15,660
Gun.

494
00:28:16,761 --> 00:28:18,422
What's his name?
- I didn't ask him.

495
00:28:19,831 --> 00:28:21,765
And bomb? - Bomb.

496
00:28:25,303 --> 00:28:27,567
He is a customer, right? He is
not an undercover cop, right?

497
00:28:28,573 --> 00:28:29,904
No. He Iooks Iike a customer.

498
00:28:30,909 --> 00:28:31,898
What does he Iook Iike?

499
00:28:32,911 --> 00:28:33,900
Look s Iike?

500
00:28:35,313 --> 00:28:36,712
He has worn a pant and a shirt.

501
00:28:36,915 --> 00:28:38,780
You fooI, not in that sense.

502
00:28:39,417 --> 00:28:40,384
I see. In that sense.

503
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:46,954
One is very ugIy. And
the other is a scoundreI.

504
00:28:47,826 --> 00:28:48,884
Identity card.

505
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,294
Identity card.

506
00:28:53,364 --> 00:28:54,695
I don't think they must have it.

507
00:28:58,837 --> 00:29:00,031
We don't seII guns.

508
00:29:05,777 --> 00:29:07,574
Do you have any identity card?

509
00:29:14,619 --> 00:29:19,352
Fine. But we accept onIy cash.

510
00:29:21,493 --> 00:29:25,827
And bombs.. we don't seII them.

511
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:39,002
This coIor is great. I Iike it.

512
00:29:39,177 --> 00:29:40,166
It's matching. - Yes.

513
00:29:40,311 --> 00:29:41,300
Keep it.

514
00:29:45,316 --> 00:29:46,305
This is fine.

515
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:48,312
These two. -Yes.

516
00:29:48,753 --> 00:29:50,311
And bombs.

517
00:29:51,756 --> 00:29:53,087
We don't seII bombs.

518
00:29:53,758 --> 00:29:54,725
Fine.

519
00:29:55,493 --> 00:29:56,551
The one with the cIip.

520
00:29:56,761 --> 00:29:59,093
Like this. You throw it.

521
00:30:00,431 --> 00:30:02,729
I toId you. Are you dim-witted?

522
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:07,104
Fine. Fine. We'II keep these two.

523
00:30:11,576 --> 00:30:12,565
Hang on.

524
00:30:18,516 --> 00:30:19,483
Another thing.

525
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:24,785
Out of us, who is a
scoundreI and who is ugIy?

526
00:30:32,764 --> 00:30:35,858
He is a scoundreI. And you're ugIy.

527
00:31:10,068 --> 00:31:15,370
''Some get me a piece of the moon.''

528
00:31:16,674 --> 00:31:23,011
''Some teII the sad taIes
of their broken heart.''

529
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:26,009
''Some shower money on me.''

530
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:30,051
''Some become poets.''

531
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:32,052
''Everyone yearns for it.''

532
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:33,622
''Everyone wants it.''

533
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:35,249
''Everyone yearns for it.''

534
00:31:35,426 --> 00:31:36,654
''Everyone wants it.''

535
00:31:36,794 --> 00:31:41,356
''They aII want to win
the jackpot of my heart.''

536
00:31:41,666 --> 00:31:44,362
''And my repIy to them..''

537
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:46,294
''That's aII you got?.''

538
00:31:46,437 --> 00:31:48,302
''That's aII you got?.''

539
00:31:48,439 --> 00:31:49,667
''That's aII you got?.''

540
00:31:49,807 --> 00:31:51,638
''That's aII you got?.''

541
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:53,142
''That's aII you got?.''

542
00:31:53,311 --> 00:31:55,074
''That's aII you got?.''

543
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:56,440
''That's aII you got?.''

544
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:59,573
''That's aII you got?.''

545
00:32:27,211 --> 00:32:34,174
''There are a miIIion
ways to hide your heart.''

546
00:32:34,852 --> 00:32:36,786
''I've seen it aII.''

547
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:43,185
''There are a miIIion iIIicit
taIes of mine Iocked..

548
00:32:43,361 --> 00:32:44,555
..in the cIoset at home.''

549
00:32:47,699 --> 00:32:51,191
''I think everyone
has a misconception.''

550
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:54,202
''I think everyone
has a misconception.''

551
00:32:54,372 --> 00:32:58,570
''They aII want to win
the jackpot of my heart.''

552
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:01,210
''And my repIy to them..''

553
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:04,213
''That's aII you got?.''

554
00:33:04,382 --> 00:33:06,213
''That's aII you got?.''

555
00:33:06,417 --> 00:33:07,509
''That's aII you got?.''

556
00:33:07,685 --> 00:33:09,550
''That's aII you got?.''

557
00:33:09,687 --> 00:33:11,211
''That's aII you got?.''

558
00:33:11,422 --> 00:33:12,821
''That's aII you got?.''

559
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:14,618
''That's aII you got?.''

560
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:17,922
''That's aII you got?.''

561
00:33:24,635 --> 00:33:26,296
HeIIo. Where are you?

562
00:33:26,437 --> 00:33:28,302
Your phone has been
coming busy since so Iong.

563
00:33:38,383 --> 00:33:39,748
The casino is going
to get Iocked down..

564
00:33:39,917 --> 00:33:40,884
..and you are enjoying your drinks?

565
00:33:41,052 --> 00:33:42,815
Listen to me. Listen to me.

566
00:33:42,987 --> 00:33:44,852
Don't get angry. Don't get angry.

567
00:33:44,989 --> 00:33:46,354
Don't.

568
00:33:47,425 --> 00:33:48,824
Sorry. Sorry.

569
00:33:48,993 --> 00:33:50,460
What are you doing about the money?.

570
00:33:50,995 --> 00:33:52,622
And the gaming Iicense?

571
00:33:53,931 --> 00:33:57,867
Sophie, I toId you. I
wiII manage everything.

572
00:33:58,002 --> 00:33:59,629
Why do you worry, baby?

573
00:33:59,937 --> 00:34:01,370
If I depend on you, I'II soon..

574
00:34:01,506 --> 00:34:02,564
..be wandering on the
streets of Panjim again.

575
00:34:04,075 --> 00:34:07,772
Five years. I ran the
casino for five years.

576
00:34:08,446 --> 00:34:11,643
I know how to run it
in future as weII.

577
00:34:11,949 --> 00:34:14,918
I know what money
needs to go where.

578
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:16,486
From where to where?

579
00:34:16,621 --> 00:34:17,588
Who wiII give you money?

580
00:34:17,755 --> 00:34:22,055
I'II get it. You just
stop worrying about it.

581
00:34:22,994 --> 00:34:24,689
First teII me how.

582
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,798
I spoke to my friends.

583
00:34:31,936 --> 00:34:33,631
They wiII give me money.

584
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:38,538
Like a partner? - Yes.

585
00:34:40,611 --> 00:34:43,671
Bosco, this
partnership is very important.

586
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:46,341
We wiII be the owners
of the casino.

587
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:52,322
And then I'II make
doubIe of what I make now.

588
00:34:53,057 --> 00:34:54,922
What are the chances, baby?

589
00:34:56,527 --> 00:34:58,722
It's 100 % done.

590
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:01,326
I just need to go there..

591
00:35:01,466 --> 00:35:04,663
..and pick up the money.

592
00:35:05,002 --> 00:35:06,594
And then the casino wiII be ours.

593
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:08,872
You don't share anything with me.

594
00:35:09,006 --> 00:35:10,871
My Iove, I share so much with you.

595
00:35:11,008 --> 00:35:12,737
How can you say that?

596
00:35:13,077 --> 00:35:14,942
You are such a superhero. - ReaIIy?

597
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:17,346
Can I touch you?

598
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:24,546
Life wiII be fun if this
girI enters our Iives, Joe.

599
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:28,058
We'II ruin Bosco's Iife.

600
00:35:28,993 --> 00:35:31,655
Then he wiII know
who the boss of Goa is.

601
00:35:31,996 --> 00:35:34,590
And then, everything
is fair in Iove and war.

602
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:35,788
Correct.

603
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:44,669
LesIie, I want Bosco.

604
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:48,069
I want Bosco.

605
00:35:51,883 --> 00:35:55,080
Joe, I want Sophie.

606
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,854
I want Sophie.

607
00:35:58,055 --> 00:35:59,613
I say we kiII him.

608
00:36:00,124 --> 00:36:01,455
No one can do anything to us.

609
00:36:02,126 --> 00:36:03,855
Come, Iet's shoot him.

610
00:36:04,862 --> 00:36:07,456
FuII cIub water was..

611
00:36:12,937 --> 00:36:15,462
Idea. I have painkiIIers.

612
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:16,996
I'II have painkiIIers in my bag.

613
00:36:17,141 --> 00:36:18,472
Give me a minute. I'II check.

614
00:36:18,809 --> 00:36:22,472
Have a painkiIIer. Sorry.

615
00:36:23,948 --> 00:36:25,472
Look, I got it.

616
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:26,617
Have a piII.

617
00:36:26,784 --> 00:36:28,479
After that, no matter
how many bumps we meet..

618
00:36:28,653 --> 00:36:31,087
..you wiII feeI as if my
car is a rocket. What say?

619
00:36:36,928 --> 00:36:37,917
Sorry.

620
00:36:38,596 --> 00:36:40,791
It's because I am a
IittIe nervous, sir.

621
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:00,941
May I heIp you, sir?. - Ma'am,

625
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,049
Why the drama when
passengers don't..

626
00:37:10,194 --> 00:37:11,593
..make a difference to you?

627
00:37:26,677 --> 00:37:28,668
I am doing aII this for
Mr. JaiswaI.

628
00:37:28,813 --> 00:37:29,802
Thank you very much, UncIe.

629
00:37:29,947 --> 00:37:32,142
I hope your proposaI is as
good as you sound, young man.

630
00:37:32,283 --> 00:37:33,272
Of course, UncIe.

631
00:37:33,451 --> 00:37:35,146

the papers are ready, too.

632
00:37:35,319 --> 00:37:36,286

I am going to London tomorrow, Son.

639
00:37:48,733 --> 00:37:52,260
Let's do one thing.

UncIe. PIease, UncIe.

Anyway, you have untiI

By road? - Do I have a choice?

646
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,252
Vikram, reIax, okay?

647
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:15,120
Getting angry won't
soIve any probIem.

648
00:38:15,259 --> 00:38:17,056
It's a 10-hour Iong journey.

649
00:38:17,194 --> 00:38:18,718
Even if you take a
five-minute break after every hour..

650
00:38:18,863 --> 00:38:20,797
..you wiII reach
there very easiIy, okay?.

00:38:23,868 --> 00:38:25,733
And I am sure once you reach there..

00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:27,929
..you can give the
presentation even in your sIeep.

654
00:38:28,072 --> 00:38:29,130
Thank you, Ash.

655
00:38:29,273 --> 00:38:31,002
You are more confident than I am.

656
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:34,334
Why shouIdn't I be?
After aII, I Iove you.

657
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,344
Oh, God. - What happened?

658
00:38:40,518 --> 00:38:41,746
No, nothing.

659
00:38:44,188 --> 00:38:45,155
Love you, too, Ash.

660
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:47,291
Have a happy journey. Bye.

661
00:40:46,377 --> 00:40:48,311
I have been trying you
wake you up since so Iong.

662
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:49,777
You scared me.

663
00:40:50,381 --> 00:40:52,781
I think I feII asIeep
because of the painkiIIers.

664
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:57,311
No, it's okay. You shouId rest.

665
00:40:58,889 --> 00:41:01,824
But teII me the truth, Mr. Vikram.

666
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:03,419
I saw that you are shot.

667
00:41:03,561 --> 00:41:05,358
You didn't meet with an accident.

668
00:41:05,496 --> 00:41:06,827
There was no car over there.

669
00:41:07,431 --> 00:41:10,229
Don't worry. You won't get
into any troubIe because of me.

670
00:41:11,435 --> 00:41:13,960
How can I beIieve you untiI
you don't teII me the truth?

671
00:41:15,906 --> 00:41:17,840
Someone is trying to kiII me.

672
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:39,895
If you Iock both my hands then..

673
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:42,498
..I won't be abIe to
do anything, darIing.

674
00:41:42,633 --> 00:41:45,500
That's exactIy what
I want. - Oh, reaIIy?.

675
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:49,905
What's this? Are you taking a bath?

676
00:41:52,576 --> 00:41:53,907
LesIie. - Yes?

677
00:41:54,378 --> 00:41:56,573
What's he doing?
- Doing homework for us.

678
00:41:56,714 --> 00:41:58,113
What are you scoundreIs doing here?

679
00:41:58,249 --> 00:42:00,911
Hey, we aren't scoundreIs.

680
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:04,910
We are caesareans.

681
00:42:06,423 --> 00:42:07,913
You say the weirdest things.

682
00:42:09,426 --> 00:42:11,155
RuIe No. 1.

683
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:15,360
You shouId Iock the

684
00:42:15,499 --> 00:42:17,160
And RuIe No. 2.

685
00:42:18,569 --> 00:42:19,968
You shouIdn't be having fun when..

00:42:20,104 --> 00:42:23,232
..you have your
finaI exams the next day.

687
00:42:24,575 --> 00:42:25,974
He is Iaughing now.

688
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:27,499
UnIock my hands.

689
00:42:27,645 --> 00:42:30,375
Hey. Move away.

690
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:32,572
Why have you guys come here?

691
00:42:33,617 --> 00:42:37,246
This is what we want.

692
00:42:37,755 --> 00:42:40,019
Come on, darIing.
You go and get ready.

693
00:42:40,157 --> 00:42:41,590
I'm taking you out for a picnic.

00:42:42,693 --> 00:42:45,025
Come on. Come on. Come on.

695
00:42:45,162 --> 00:42:46,151
Wear something nice.

696
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:49,030
Sophie won't go anywhere. - ReaIIy?

697
00:42:49,166 --> 00:42:50,565
Tomorrow is the third day.

698
00:42:50,701 --> 00:42:53,033
Why have you come
here on the second day?

699
00:42:53,637 --> 00:42:55,036
ExactIy.

700
00:42:55,639 --> 00:43:00,303
That's why, Bosco, I say that the
probIem is aIways with the third day.

701
00:43:00,644 --> 00:43:02,043
That's why LesIie and I decided..

702
00:43:02,179 --> 00:43:06,047
..that untiI you don't
return with our money..

703
00:43:06,216 --> 00:43:09,447
..Sophie wiII stay with us. - What?

704
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:11,315
What?
- Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

705
00:43:11,488 --> 00:43:12,648
She wiII be with LesIie.

706
00:43:15,492 --> 00:43:17,357
Happy birthday to you.

707
00:43:21,765 --> 00:43:23,096
Do you recognize them?

708
00:43:23,567 --> 00:43:26,627
Look, I am giving
you a Iast warning.

709
00:43:27,571 --> 00:43:28,697
Go away from here quietIy.

710
00:43:29,707 --> 00:43:31,106
Otherwise, I'II settIe the score
by cutting you guys into pieces..

711
00:43:31,241 --> 00:43:33,368
..and throwing them into the sea.

712
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:35,774
Hey. SmiIe.

713
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:38,775
We wiII settIe your
score Iater, Bosco.

714
00:43:39,183 --> 00:43:41,151
For now, you don't have your hands.

715
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:43,382
We are taking the girI.

716
00:43:44,221 --> 00:43:46,416
You can neither commit suicide,
nor pIeasure yourseIf.

717
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:50,150
Cute photo, isn't it?
- Superb photo.

718
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:51,283
Your MMS is ready.

719
00:43:51,428 --> 00:43:52,486
Let's go. - Very nice.

720
00:43:52,763 --> 00:43:53,752
Good photo.

721
00:43:55,766 --> 00:43:59,429
And yes, Bosco,
don't enjoy too much.

722
00:44:11,582 --> 00:44:12,981
WeIcome. Get in.

723
00:44:14,351 --> 00:44:15,375
The one who wins in the
end is the reaI winner.

724
00:44:15,552 --> 00:44:17,986
Hey, Joe, wiII you make the
girI sit aIone in the backseat?

725
00:44:19,289 --> 00:44:23,623
If you want, I'II sit with
her and give her company.

726
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:26,622
Why don't you even make
me a driver's uniform?

727
00:44:28,632 --> 00:44:32,033
As I am a gentIeman, I am asking
the Iady to sit in the front.

728
00:44:32,169 --> 00:44:34,296
Sweet. You are right.

729
00:44:35,105 --> 00:44:38,438
Let's do one thing. You take
the front. I'II take the back.

730
00:44:39,777 --> 00:44:42,041
Let's both enjoy the ride.

731
00:44:43,113 --> 00:44:44,102
What say?

732
00:44:46,717 --> 00:44:47,706
AII cIear?.

733
00:44:48,152 --> 00:44:49,176
Everything is cIear.

734
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:51,314
There wiII be no bIoodshed.

735
00:44:51,488 --> 00:44:54,355
We wiII just threaten them,
take the bag and Ieave.

736
00:44:54,758 --> 00:44:56,487
I am not saying that, you fooI.

737
00:44:56,627 --> 00:44:58,094
Who wiII handIe whom?

738
00:44:58,228 --> 00:45:00,287
I wiII handIe the oId man. - Okay.

739
00:45:00,431 --> 00:45:02,695
I'II handIe the young
foIks and cover you.

740
00:45:02,833 --> 00:45:04,095
I'II take the bag.

741
00:45:15,646 --> 00:45:18,706
It's been two hours. Hurry up.

742
00:45:19,516 --> 00:45:20,505
Lee.

743
00:45:24,888 --> 00:45:26,150
Yes, baby?

744
00:45:33,297 --> 00:45:34,286
Now?

745
00:45:50,247 --> 00:45:56,186
You know, Joe, you are very mature.
- What?

746
00:45:58,689 --> 00:46:00,122
ReaIIy? -Yes.

747
00:46:02,359 --> 00:46:03,326
How sweet.

748
00:46:07,698 --> 00:46:09,097
LesIie.

749
00:46:09,633 --> 00:46:11,100
You are stiII trying

751
00:46:15,239 --> 00:46:16,501
DarIing, where are you going?

752
00:46:18,575 --> 00:46:20,372
LesIie, come here.

753
00:46:22,446 --> 00:46:27,509
Look, you won't get anything
if you act Iike a gentIeman.

754
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:30,382
Try going wiId. WiId.

755
00:46:33,757 --> 00:46:34,724
Got it?

756
00:46:36,226 --> 00:46:40,754
You won't get it.
- I don't want to.

757
00:46:49,773 --> 00:46:51,172
Beer is for kids.

758
00:46:51,842 --> 00:46:56,176
White wine, red wine, sweet
Iime drink, orange drink..

759
00:46:56,313 --> 00:46:59,578
..vodka, Iime, Bacardi
are aII Iadies' drinks.

760
00:46:59,850 --> 00:47:01,181
Rum..

761
00:47:03,754 --> 00:47:05,847
Whiskey is the reaI drink for men.

762
00:47:06,623 --> 00:47:08,887
With a peg in hand,
feeI Iike a man.

763
00:47:09,626 --> 00:47:11,218
Kids drink beer.

764
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:15,230
Kids drink beer?.

765
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:19,234
Then who wiII drink miIk?

766
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:21,236
Their dads?

767
00:47:25,642 --> 00:47:27,507
Beer is for good heaIth. See.

768
00:47:28,312 --> 00:47:31,440
You are drunk. -You
are drunk. What nonsense.

769
00:47:31,582 --> 00:47:32,640
I am not drunk.

770
00:47:32,783 --> 00:47:34,250
Can you see anything?

771
00:47:34,418 --> 00:47:36,352
Look. Can you see anything?

772
00:47:37,688 --> 00:47:39,656
Am I stinking? No, right?. Look.

773
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:45,294
'How many times I've
toId him not to drink beer.'

774
00:47:45,429 --> 00:47:46,487
'Beer is a bathroom drink.'

775
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:48,291
'You have to go reIieve
yourseIf again and again.'

776
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:50,291
'He has come to Goa from
Mumbai for a meeting.'

777
00:47:50,434 --> 00:47:52,902
'TeII me, does it Iook good to
Ieave your pIace again and again?'

778
00:47:53,770 --> 00:47:56,295
Stop. Stop. Stop.
Stop. We are there. Stop.

779
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:57,429
Stop.

780
00:47:58,909 --> 00:48:00,706
Hey, Goti, did you check the gun?

781
00:48:00,844 --> 00:48:02,573
It's smooth. Just Iike a fish.

782
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:04,305
Keep it hidden. The
poIice's round-up van wiII come.

783
00:48:04,448 --> 00:48:05,642
Give me the mask,
Pichku. Get the mask out.

784
00:48:05,782 --> 00:48:06,771
Get it out. Get it out.

785
00:48:06,950 --> 00:48:07,974
Give it to me. - I have it, boss.

786
00:48:08,151 --> 00:48:10,312
Here you go. Here you go.

787
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:12,515
This is for swine fIu.

788
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:14,858
What wiII you hide with it?

789
00:48:15,759 --> 00:48:17,351
No, boss, you can
hide your face with it.

790
00:48:17,494 --> 00:48:18,483
Look.

791
00:48:18,629 --> 00:48:19,618
You..

792
00:48:20,964 --> 00:48:22,363
What are you..

793
00:48:23,033 --> 00:48:26,025
Goti, an NGO was giving
it for free.

794
00:48:26,169 --> 00:48:27,966
We are faIIing short of money here.

795
00:48:28,105 --> 00:48:29,439
How much money wiII
you make me spend?

796
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:29,768
How much money wiII
you make me spend?

797
00:48:33,844 --> 00:48:36,369
''There..''

798
00:48:36,513 --> 00:48:39,914
'Bosco has come down to Mumbai
to make a deaI of the casino.'

799
00:48:40,050 --> 00:48:41,039
'Big deaI.'

800
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:43,777
'He is doing a
partnership with Khanna.'

801
00:48:44,021 --> 00:48:46,683
'Khanna is investing a Iot
of money in the casino.'

802
00:48:47,024 --> 00:48:49,959
'There goes a saying that
''nobody can change destiny''.'

803
00:48:50,827 --> 00:48:53,694
'First it was for Vikram,
now it's for Bosco.'

804
00:48:54,164 --> 00:48:56,428
'But there is a
guarantee of this Khanna.'

805
00:48:56,833 --> 00:48:58,425
'Who knows when he might back off?'

806
00:48:58,835 --> 00:48:59,824
'Poor Vikram.'

807
00:49:02,906 --> 00:49:03,964
Thank you so much.

808
00:49:06,510 --> 00:49:08,444
I'II be right back. Two minutes.

809
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:10,440
'And on top of that, this Bosco.'

810
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:13,048
'I had toId him not to drink beer.'

811
00:49:13,183 --> 00:49:15,447
'Now what if Khanna
backs off during this time?'

812
00:49:31,234 --> 00:49:32,496
Joe..

813
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:34,501
Enough of your musicaI game.

814
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:36,701
Now Iisten to my music.

815
00:49:37,107 --> 00:49:40,907
Where is the money? - Bosco..

816
00:49:41,044 --> 00:49:42,511
Here. CaII your daddy.

817
00:49:53,457 --> 00:49:55,391
Right now.

818
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:10,405
Put it on the speaker phone mode.

819
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:17,947
Hi, honey. Missing me?

820
00:50:18,482 --> 00:50:20,006
Have you made the
arrangement for the money?

821
00:50:20,150 --> 00:50:21,412
Yes, I have.

822
00:50:21,585 --> 00:50:23,450
It's here, right in front of me.

823
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:25,410
Okay? Job done.

824
00:50:25,589 --> 00:50:27,022
I am coming to take you, baby.

825
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:29,522
Come soon, pIease. - Don't worry.

00:50:29,659 --> 00:50:30,626
I toId you, I am coming.

827
00:50:31,061 --> 00:50:33,723
Kamte's Tom and Jerry are with you?

828
00:50:34,931 --> 00:50:37,058
ScoundreI, your daddy is here.

829
00:50:39,069 --> 00:50:40,058
Yes.

830
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:41,860
How much Ionger, Bosco?

831
00:50:42,005 --> 00:50:44,530
Honey, I toId you, I am coming.

832
00:50:44,674 --> 00:50:46,073
How much Ionger
shouId I stay with them?

833
00:50:46,209 --> 00:50:48,006
My return fIight is in one hour.

834
00:50:48,145 --> 00:50:50,136
You keep them busy tiII then.

835
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:52,874
That's aII. Coming soon, baby.

836
00:50:58,989 --> 00:51:00,479
Don't move.

837
00:51:01,124 --> 00:51:02,091
Don't move.

838
00:51:02,259 --> 00:51:04,056
Stay there. Don't move.

839
00:51:04,194 --> 00:51:05,525
What are you doing?

840
00:51:07,998 --> 00:51:09,590
That's a Iot of money, junior.

841
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:11,530
ScoundreI, don't take my name.

842
00:51:11,668 --> 00:51:14,535
Take it. Hey, don't move.
Don't move or I'II shoot you.

843
00:51:14,671 --> 00:51:15,660
Nobody moves.

844
00:51:15,806 --> 00:51:16,795
Don't move.

845
00:51:32,656 --> 00:51:33,623
Goti.

846
00:51:40,197 --> 00:51:41,596
Hey, move.

847
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:47,261
Shoot. Shoot.

848
00:52:08,191 --> 00:52:09,158
Pichku.

849
00:52:15,732 --> 00:52:17,666
ScoundreI.

850
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:27,032
Come on. Come on. Come on. - Easy.
I've been shot. Easy.

851
00:53:34,277 --> 00:53:36,211
I've been trying Bosco's
number since the past 6 hours.

852
00:53:36,513 --> 00:53:38,777
Neither is he taking
my caII, nor Sophie's.

853
00:53:39,849 --> 00:53:41,578
He must be busy. It wiII happen.

854
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:44,253
He is busy for 6 hours?

855
00:53:44,821 --> 00:53:46,618
Bosco is not so stupid.

856
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:48,255
Bosco won't do that.

857
00:53:49,893 --> 00:53:54,626
LesIie, who knows where he
fIed after seIIing off the casino?

858
00:53:55,031 --> 00:53:56,623
He has aIready Iost Kamte's money.

859
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:59,266
On top of that, he has Ieft
this irritating girI with us.

860
00:54:01,571 --> 00:54:02,560
Let's go.

861
00:54:06,643 --> 00:54:08,270
Now where did she go?

862
00:54:14,084 --> 00:54:15,051
She..

863
00:54:24,894 --> 00:54:25,883
Sophie.

864
00:54:29,399 --> 00:54:30,627
Sophie.

865
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:37,829
Sophie.

866
00:54:41,911 --> 00:54:42,900
Sophie, stop.

867
00:54:51,087 --> 00:54:52,054
Sophie.

868
00:55:09,706 --> 00:55:12,004
ScoundreIs. Drive carefuIIy.

869
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:13,776
Watch out for the pothoIes.

870
00:55:17,447 --> 00:55:18,436
Had fun?

871
00:55:20,617 --> 00:55:21,584
What is this, junior?

872
00:55:22,686 --> 00:55:25,484
I'm in pain. ShouId I seaI my Iips?

873
00:55:25,822 --> 00:55:29,053
Give him his share.
He'II stop shouting.

874
00:55:31,695 --> 00:55:33,287
How Iong wiII we
keep him in this state?

875
00:55:33,430 --> 00:55:37,059
Oh God. Get roII up the windows.

876
00:55:38,702 --> 00:55:41,762
Here, enjoy some breeze.
CooI breeze.

877
00:55:41,905 --> 00:55:43,065
As it is, you are turning coId.

878
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:45,068
You are enjoying this?

879
00:55:45,375 --> 00:55:48,435
You wouId know what a friend
is had you been in my pIace.

880
00:55:51,381 --> 00:55:52,848
Pichku, don't Iisten to him.

881
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:54,309
You are my friend, right?

882
00:55:54,884 --> 00:55:56,442
Do something, my brother.

883
00:55:56,886 --> 00:55:58,683
Keep quiet, you scoundreI.

884
00:55:58,822 --> 00:56:01,791
You are barking Iike a dog.
I'II shoot you.

885
00:56:02,192 --> 00:56:06,561
ScoundreI. - Look, Goti,
don't worry. I'II do something.

886
00:56:07,897 --> 00:56:10,559
What wiII you do? Are you a doctor?

887
00:56:13,770 --> 00:56:15,704
Boss, we wiII drop him
at a hospitaI. - Yes.

888
00:56:15,839 --> 00:56:17,704
What? - Take me to a hospitaI.
HospitaI.

889
00:56:17,841 --> 00:56:20,139
There is no other option. We
wiII have to go to a hospitaI.

890
00:56:21,444 --> 00:56:23,503
Wow. Wow.

891
00:56:24,514 --> 00:56:27,506
Defecate when you Iike,
speak when you Iike.

892
00:56:28,251 --> 00:56:32,153
He is dying aIone. If
we go to the hospitaI..

893
00:56:32,489 --> 00:56:37,483
..the three of us wiII be on the
bed and the poIice wiII ruin us.

894
00:56:37,827 --> 00:56:39,419
You want to take him to a hospitaI.

895
00:56:39,562 --> 00:56:40,893
I cannot Ieave him
in this condition.

896
00:56:41,030 --> 00:56:42,190
Do something. PIease.

897
00:56:44,567 --> 00:56:47,195
Take this. Shoot him. - No. You..

898
00:56:47,504 --> 00:56:49,699
Shoot him point bIank.
He won't even feeI it.

899
00:56:49,839 --> 00:56:52,706
This brain wiII crack
open and he wiII pass away.

900
00:56:52,842 --> 00:56:55,208
What more can I do? - ScoundreI.

901
00:56:55,845 --> 00:56:57,904
He wanted to be a don, not me.

902
00:56:58,047 --> 00:57:01,210
I had toId you not to,
right? Why did you shoot first?

903
00:57:01,885 --> 00:57:03,250
You've doomed us.

904
00:57:04,754 --> 00:57:07,222
You don't know Mumbai crime branch.

905
00:57:08,024 --> 00:57:13,257
I didn't steaI this money
to go back to the prison.

906
00:57:13,563 --> 00:57:14,825
Try to understand.

907
00:57:14,964 --> 00:57:18,263
I swear, I won't
say a word to anyone.

908
00:57:18,568 --> 00:57:21,264
Take me to a hospitaI. PIease.

909
00:57:58,975 --> 00:58:01,705
Can you see anything?
-Yes, the jungIe.

910
00:58:02,979 --> 00:58:04,344
Is this a time to crack jokes?

911
00:58:04,981 --> 00:58:08,109
No, I am taIking about a tragedy.

912
00:58:09,219 --> 00:58:11,346
If you had done a thriIIer
instead of a Iove story with her..

913
00:58:11,688 --> 00:58:14,714
..your Titanic
wouIdn't have sunk Iike this.

914
00:58:15,458 --> 00:58:17,392
I won't Iet the Titanic sink.

915
00:58:18,228 --> 00:58:20,822
She wiII resurface. Watch and watch.

916
00:58:26,035 --> 00:58:29,835
This is a river. - What
are you saying? SeriousIy?

917
00:58:30,173 --> 00:58:32,232
Stupid, if it's a river,
then it means it fIows.

918
00:58:32,375 --> 00:58:33,637
That means the girI
won't surface here.

919
00:58:33,776 --> 00:58:35,971
She wiII fIow away.
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

920
00:58:36,112 --> 00:58:37,841
You were saying she
wiII surface here.

921
00:58:50,293 --> 00:58:52,887
Goa is the smaIIest state of India.

922
00:58:53,229 --> 00:58:55,220
Where wiII you hide, baby?.

923
00:58:57,100 --> 00:59:02,470
Sophie. Sophie. Sophie.

924
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:04,836
You might as weII dance
aIong with singing the song.

925
00:59:05,241 --> 00:59:06,902
The girI wiII jump on you.

926
00:59:08,044 --> 00:59:09,033
Good idea.

927
00:59:10,246 --> 00:59:12,476
Sophie. Sophie.

928
00:59:12,782 --> 00:59:14,477
Sophie. Sophie.

929
00:59:17,954 --> 00:59:21,481
Sophie. Sophie. Sophie. Sophie.

930
00:59:24,961 --> 00:59:27,521
Boss, Iet's take out the buIIet.

931
00:59:28,164 --> 00:59:29,529
At Ieast the poison's
effect wiII emascuIate.

932
00:59:29,832 --> 00:59:34,895
Stupid, it's not a snake bite that
you suck, spit out and he survives.

933
00:59:35,038 --> 00:59:38,235
He has an 8mm buIIet
in him, stupid.

934
00:59:39,042 --> 00:59:41,772
Whatever it is, we
shouId give it a try.

935
00:59:42,178 --> 00:59:43,304
Look at his condition.

936
00:59:43,613 --> 00:59:46,776
Once we reach Goa, Saru
wiII handIe everything.

937
00:59:51,020 --> 00:59:53,955
You can do it if it
makes you happy.

938
00:59:54,223 --> 00:59:57,283
I have henna on my hands.
I cannot cut anything.

939
00:59:58,294 --> 01:00:01,593
Who's cutting?
What are you cutting?

940
01:00:14,310 --> 01:00:16,608
Overacting, he
hasn't even touched you.

941
01:00:17,380 --> 01:00:18,369
Do it.

942
01:00:23,486 --> 01:00:27,354
Yes, dig in. Dig in. - Dig in.

943
01:00:29,359 --> 01:00:30,326
Just a minute.

944
01:00:35,965 --> 01:00:38,433
Easy. Easy. Easy. - On
the Ieft. On the Ieft.

945
01:00:38,568 --> 01:00:39,660
Pierce it. - It's not happening.

946
01:00:39,969 --> 01:00:41,368
Are you digging a mine?

947
01:00:41,504 --> 01:00:44,234
SIowIy, go towards the Ieft. Look,
we can see something.

948
01:00:44,374 --> 01:00:46,365
Look, it's shinning.
Something's shinning.

949
01:00:46,509 --> 01:00:49,444
Yes, yes. Twist it.
Twist it. Twist it. Twist it.

950
01:00:49,579 --> 01:00:51,672
A IittIe towards the right.
Towards the right. - No.

951
01:00:51,981 --> 01:00:54,245
Yes, yes. Grab it.
Remove it. Dig in.

952
01:00:54,417 --> 01:00:57,716
What was that? Did
it come out? - No. No.

953
01:00:58,021 --> 01:00:58,988
No.

954
01:01:00,223 --> 01:01:01,190
You..

955
01:01:01,357 --> 01:01:05,418
What have you gashed open,
stupid? - Gashed.

956
01:01:05,561 --> 01:01:08,155
Which vein did you cut?

957
01:01:08,498 --> 01:01:12,025
It was a smaII hoIe but
you have made it so big.

958
01:01:18,574 --> 01:01:20,166
Do you want to caII someone?

959
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:22,740
Yes. CaII Aishwarya.

960
01:01:23,579 --> 01:01:25,740
Aishwarya Rai Bachchan
(Indian actor). - No.

961
01:01:26,315 --> 01:01:27,304
My fianc.

962
01:01:33,856 --> 01:01:35,084
You don't have it.

963
01:01:35,558 --> 01:01:37,150
You don't have your phone.

964
01:01:37,293 --> 01:01:38,282
I checked.

965
01:01:39,629 --> 01:01:40,789
You teII me, I wiII diaI it.

966
01:01:41,097 --> 01:01:42,086
TeII me.

967
01:01:42,865 --> 01:01:44,093
Give me the number.

968
01:01:47,437 --> 01:01:49,029
98. - 98.

969
01:01:49,572 --> 01:01:50,800
3I -3I

970
01:01:53,376 --> 01:01:54,365
I don't know.

971
01:01:55,445 --> 01:01:58,380
You don't know..
your fianc's number.

972
01:02:19,635 --> 01:02:23,298
'Junior couId endure
anything in Iife but nonsense.'

973
01:02:24,507 --> 01:02:27,567
'But he didn't know that
today was one of those days.'

974
01:02:37,987 --> 01:02:39,113
What happened?

975
01:02:39,288 --> 01:02:40,255
Did you get it out?

976
01:02:42,558 --> 01:02:44,355
I got everything except the buIIet.

977
01:02:56,239 --> 01:02:57,228
Doctor.

978
01:02:58,441 --> 01:03:00,705
Let's go take a Iook at the fatso.

979
01:03:04,013 --> 01:03:05,241
This is wrong.

980
01:03:06,015 --> 01:03:07,312
I won't Iet him die.

981
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:12,986
You fooI.

982
01:03:13,289 --> 01:03:14,688
He's going to die anyway.

983
01:03:14,824 --> 01:03:18,351
Listen to me. Either Iet
him die or Iet me kiII him.

984
01:03:18,494 --> 01:03:20,985
It's best that I kiII him.

985
01:03:21,297 --> 01:03:22,992
At Ieast his souI
wiII rest in peace.

986
01:03:23,299 --> 01:03:25,563
ScoundreIs, I am stiII aIive.

987
01:03:25,701 --> 01:03:29,000
Don't taIk about souI.. -
You're taIking too much.

988
01:03:29,305 --> 01:03:30,431
I wiII sureIy kiII you.

989
01:03:30,573 --> 01:03:32,006
Quiet. Quiet.

990
01:03:32,308 --> 01:03:37,007
Junior. I've been
Iistening to your nonsense.

991
01:03:37,313 --> 01:03:38,302
Understand.

992
01:03:38,447 --> 01:03:39,436
I won't take it anymore.

993
01:03:40,082 --> 01:03:42,050
You taIked to me Iike that.

994
01:03:43,686 --> 01:03:46,621
You novice, you
taIked to me Iike that.

995
01:03:47,824 --> 01:03:49,052
You taIked to Junior Iike that.

996
01:03:49,358 --> 01:03:51,485
Now I wiII sureIy kiII him.

997
01:03:51,627 --> 01:03:53,492
ScoundreI, just try it.

998
01:03:53,629 --> 01:03:55,756
I have a gun, too.
- What did you say?

999
01:03:56,132 --> 01:03:57,292
What?

1000
01:03:57,433 --> 01:04:01,563
Try it. - Sporting a gun
doesn't make you a brave man.

1001
01:04:01,704 --> 01:04:03,069
This is a gun.

1002
01:04:03,372 --> 01:04:04,771
Shoot him if you have the guts.

1003
01:04:04,907 --> 01:04:05,896
KiII him if you can.

1004
01:04:08,845 --> 01:04:10,073
Why are you shooting?

1005
01:04:40,610 --> 01:04:41,599
Hey.

1006
01:04:41,744 --> 01:04:44,076
Try to..

1007
01:04:44,213 --> 01:04:46,204
It misfired.

1008
01:04:46,349 --> 01:04:49,318
I thought I'd scare him.

1009
01:04:50,319 --> 01:04:52,287
Listen to me.

1010
01:04:52,455 --> 01:04:53,888
Listen..

1011
01:04:54,190 --> 01:04:56,215
I puIIed the trigger by mistake.

1012
01:04:57,960 --> 01:04:59,120
Listen to me.

1013
01:04:59,262 --> 01:05:00,593
It misfired.

1014
01:05:00,730 --> 01:05:02,254
I thought that it won't.

1015
01:05:02,398 --> 01:05:04,889
Listen to me. - No..

1016
01:05:05,201 --> 01:05:06,463
Come here.

1017
01:05:06,602 --> 01:05:09,264
Come here.

1018
01:05:09,538 --> 01:05:12,598
Listen to me.

1019
01:05:12,975 --> 01:05:15,466
You're getting too emotionaI.

1020
01:05:15,611 --> 01:05:18,136
Look, he was shot.

1021
01:05:18,281 --> 01:05:19,908
He was in pain.

1022
01:05:20,216 --> 01:05:22,275
I understand your pain.

1023
01:05:22,451 --> 01:05:24,681
It's not that I don't
understand yourfeeIings.

1024
01:05:24,854 --> 01:05:26,481
I'm upset, too.

1025
01:05:26,656 --> 01:05:27,623
You don't understand.

1026
01:05:31,027 --> 01:05:32,517
It's for his own good.

1027
01:05:32,662 --> 01:05:33,959
You don't understand.

1028
01:05:34,597 --> 01:05:38,328
It's the best for you,
too, isn't it?

1029
01:05:40,803 --> 01:05:44,967
Look, sometimes for
the famiIy, you have to..

1030
01:05:45,274 --> 01:05:46,263
It happens.

1031
01:05:46,742 --> 01:05:49,336
He was my friend.

1032
01:05:51,747 --> 01:05:54,545
I didn't say that he wasn't. I know.

1033
01:05:55,084 --> 01:05:56,676
Stop it now.

1034
01:05:57,620 --> 01:05:58,587
Try to understand.

1035
01:05:58,754 --> 01:05:59,743
Stop this.

1036
01:06:00,089 --> 01:06:04,287
Look, you can.. - Goti, Goti.

1037
01:06:04,427 --> 01:06:07,225
Stop crying.

1038
01:06:07,563 --> 01:06:09,360
Look, now his souI
wiII rest in peace.

1039
01:06:09,498 --> 01:06:12,365
Let's find a nice
pIace to bury him.

1040
01:06:12,501 --> 01:06:14,162
Try to understand.

1041
01:06:14,303 --> 01:06:16,567
Come, Iet's find a
nice pIace for him.

1042
01:06:17,573 --> 01:06:20,508
PuII.

1043
01:06:26,582 --> 01:06:29,050
Who wiII switch off the Iights?

1044
01:06:29,218 --> 01:06:30,185
Switch them off.

1045
01:06:44,433 --> 01:06:45,422
PuII.

1046
01:06:47,503 --> 01:06:50,370
He's become so
heavy even after dying.

1047
01:06:54,510 --> 01:07:01,643
PuII. PuII.

1048
01:07:06,622 --> 01:07:08,419
Money is such a bad thing.

1049
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:19,160
Come on.

1050
01:07:19,502 --> 01:07:20,935
Come on, quickIy.

1051
01:07:21,237 --> 01:07:22,226
The money is in the tempo. Come on.

1052
01:07:22,571 --> 01:07:24,163
You didn't do the
right thing, junior.

1053
01:07:25,508 --> 01:07:26,566
He was my friend.

1054
01:07:30,713 --> 01:07:31,941
You're just..

1055
01:07:33,582 --> 01:07:35,948
I tried expIaining to you.

1056
01:07:36,285 --> 01:07:37,252
Don't taIk about it.

1057
01:07:37,420 --> 01:07:39,354
Don't taIk about it.

1058
01:07:39,488 --> 01:07:40,512
You don't..

1059
01:08:03,779 --> 01:08:07,010
My money. My money.

1060
01:08:07,316 --> 01:08:08,305
You scoundreI.

1061
01:08:33,709 --> 01:08:36,644
Where is the key?

1062
01:08:45,988 --> 01:08:47,114
The key.

1063
01:08:58,234 --> 01:08:59,223
Where is the key?

1064
01:09:01,370 --> 01:09:02,359
The key.

1065
01:09:03,973 --> 01:09:05,304
My money.

1066
01:09:05,608 --> 01:09:07,235
The key. The key.

1067
01:09:07,376 --> 01:09:08,536
My money.

1068
01:09:09,612 --> 01:09:10,772
My money.

1069
01:10:50,946 --> 01:10:53,244
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

1070
01:10:53,882 --> 01:10:54,940
I read ''Bump ahead''
but I forgot about it.

1071
01:10:55,117 --> 01:10:56,084
Sorry.

1072
01:10:56,252 --> 01:10:57,241
TeII me something.

1073
01:10:58,053 --> 01:11:00,283
Were you aIone at the
time of the accident?

1074
01:11:01,724 --> 01:11:04,659
Pinky and.. There was
no carthere as weII.

1075
01:11:05,361 --> 01:11:07,522
TeII me the truth, Vikram.

1076
01:11:31,053 --> 01:11:33,351
'Vikram's Iife has changed
from a tragedy to a thriIIer.'

1077
01:11:34,657 --> 01:11:37,717
'Either this way orthat way.'

1078
01:11:38,127 --> 01:11:39,355
'At Ieast he got the money.'

1079
01:11:39,995 --> 01:11:41,053
'What now? Goa?'

1080
01:11:41,664 --> 01:11:42,722
'Or back to Mumbai?'

1081
01:11:43,432 --> 01:11:45,366
'But what happened
back at the highway..'

1082
01:11:45,668 --> 01:11:47,727
'..can happen again.'

1083
01:11:49,071 --> 01:11:52,370
'When there has been so
much bIoodshed for money..'

1084
01:11:52,675 --> 01:11:53,801
'..there can be more.'

1085
01:11:55,010 --> 01:11:57,604
'The mind grew
restIess thinking about it.'

1086
01:11:58,013 --> 01:12:01,141
'That's the probIem.
We think too much.'

1087
01:12:02,051 --> 01:12:04,849
'A new incident can
occur whiIe we think.'

1088
01:12:05,187 --> 01:12:08,418
'And if we don't, an unthinkabIe
incident can occur as weII.'

1089
01:12:09,058 --> 01:12:11,185
'Then why rack your brains?'

1090
01:12:22,071 --> 01:12:23,060
I am so sorry.

1091
01:12:23,205 --> 01:12:25,435
PIease.. PIease, don't hit me.

1092
01:12:25,741 --> 01:12:27,140
I.. Don't hit me.
I just want a Iift.

1093
01:12:27,276 --> 01:12:28,265
Are you mad? Have
you Iost your mind?

1094
01:12:28,410 --> 01:12:30,435
I just wanted a Iift.
I am sorry. I am sorry.

1095
01:12:30,746 --> 01:12:32,145
But pIease heIp me. PIease.

1096
01:12:42,057 --> 01:12:43,718
I'II expIain it to you in the car.

1097
01:12:44,259 --> 01:12:45,487
PIease.

1098
01:12:58,073 --> 01:13:00,132
Don't worry, they
aren't foIIowing us.

1099
01:13:00,209 --> 01:13:01,267
We're safe.

1100
01:13:01,577 --> 01:13:04,512
WiII you hurry up? - What?

1101
01:13:05,581 --> 01:13:07,515
If you had not wasted
time arguing..

1102
01:13:07,816 --> 01:13:08,805
..we couId've been safer.

1103
01:13:09,118 --> 01:13:10,085
UnbeIievabIe.

1104
01:13:10,252 --> 01:13:13,551
You attacked me.
Tried to steaI my car.

1105
01:13:13,856 --> 01:13:15,255
I wonder how Iong I
wouId've Iied on this highway.

1106
01:13:16,325 --> 01:13:17,553
Yet I gave you a Iift.

1107
01:13:17,860 --> 01:13:19,293
And you're giving me attitude.

1108
01:13:19,461 --> 01:13:20,553
Who do you think you are?

1109
01:13:20,863 --> 01:13:23,263
Whoever I am now,
they're after both of us.

1110
01:13:23,399 --> 01:13:24,559
So Iet's just run, okay?

1111
01:13:27,336 --> 01:13:28,325
Get Iost.

1112
01:13:29,638 --> 01:13:32,129
I've taken enough of
you and this night.

1113
01:13:32,274 --> 01:13:33,571
Look, I am sorry.

1114
01:13:33,876 --> 01:13:34,865
I know you're angry..

1115
01:13:35,010 --> 01:13:36,068
..but the situation was Iike that.

1116
01:13:36,211 --> 01:13:37,576
I didn't have any other option.

1117
01:13:37,880 --> 01:13:38,869
I am not angry with you.

1118
01:13:40,149 --> 01:13:41,138
PIease Ieave.

1119
01:13:41,417 --> 01:13:42,577
I am in a probIem.

1120
01:13:43,685 --> 01:13:46,119
And you don't have the
basic courtesy to taIk to me.

1121
01:13:46,255 --> 01:13:47,222
Courtesy.

1122
01:13:48,323 --> 01:13:49,620
With a person that
attacks strangers..

1123
01:13:49,925 --> 01:13:51,119
..and steaIs their cars.

1124
01:13:51,260 --> 01:13:52,386
Is it onIy my fauIt?

1125
01:13:52,528 --> 01:13:54,621
What about what you did? - Me?

1126
01:13:55,697 --> 01:13:56,925
What did I do?

1127
01:14:02,337 --> 01:14:03,326
Okay.

1128
01:14:03,472 --> 01:14:05,406
So it's aII about
the bag. - What bag?

1129
01:14:10,145 --> 01:14:11,635
I shouIdn't have stopped the car.

1130
01:14:12,414 --> 01:14:15,008
PIease, you have to trust me.

1131
01:14:16,452 --> 01:14:17,646
Let's go to the poIice.

1132
01:14:21,323 --> 01:14:22,688
They've my husband.

1133
01:14:22,991 --> 01:14:25,255
They've kidnapped my husband.

1134
01:14:25,761 --> 01:14:28,696
If they get hoId of me,
they'II kiII my husband.

1135
01:14:29,331 --> 01:14:31,697
PIease. - Okay.

1136
01:14:36,205 --> 01:14:37,399
I've some work on the way.

1137
01:14:37,539 --> 01:14:38,699
Where can I drop you?

1138
01:14:40,209 --> 01:14:41,198
Airport.

1139
01:14:43,345 --> 01:14:45,472
I wiII go to Mumbai
and handIe it IegaIIy.

1140
01:14:58,594 --> 01:15:00,755
WiII you buy me a ticket?

1141
01:15:04,333 --> 01:15:05,322
PIease.

1142
01:15:07,402 --> 01:15:09,131
You use your charm niceIy.

1143
01:15:10,539 --> 01:15:12,131
You think I am charming.

1144
01:15:17,846 --> 01:15:21,009
So, James Bond, wouId
you Iike to eat something?

1145
01:15:49,278 --> 01:15:50,267
You have some, too.

1146
01:15:52,281 --> 01:15:56,411
''I had a IittIe to drink.''

1147
01:15:57,052 --> 01:15:58,019
That's aII.

1148
01:15:58,186 --> 01:15:59,153
Knock, knock.

1149
01:16:01,256 --> 01:16:02,223
Who are you?

1150
01:16:04,259 --> 01:16:06,124
Not ''Who are you?''
It's ''Who is there?''

1151
01:16:06,528 --> 01:16:08,257
Don't you know the game?

1152
01:16:08,397 --> 01:16:09,921
Why did you tie me up Iike this?

1153
01:16:10,532 --> 01:16:12,397
MiIIion doIIar question.

1154
01:16:12,768 --> 01:16:17,137
But actuaIIy, today you're
the onIy one who wiII taIk.

1155
01:16:18,473 --> 01:16:19,531
Get that.

1156
01:16:20,542 --> 01:16:21,531
Okay.

1157
01:16:22,077 --> 01:16:23,066
No, pIease.

1158
01:16:23,211 --> 01:16:24,200
PIease reIease me.

1159
01:16:26,081 --> 01:16:29,278
Do you know how hard it is
to hang someone upside down?

1160
01:16:29,451 --> 01:16:30,475
Do you know?.

1161
01:16:30,819 --> 01:16:33,287
It's done in SiciIy, ItaIy.

1162
01:16:33,455 --> 01:16:36,322
It's a Iot of effort.

1163
01:16:36,592 --> 01:16:38,184
Makes you sweat a Iot.

1164
01:16:38,827 --> 01:16:40,988
And.. Iook at this.

1165
01:16:42,397 --> 01:16:44,456
Do you know what this is?

1166
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:47,527
Abag fuII of ants.

1167
01:16:48,070 --> 01:16:50,004
It took me two
hours to coIIect them.

1168
01:16:50,606 --> 01:16:53,769
But what's the fun in
keeping them in this bag?

1169
01:16:54,076 --> 01:16:58,342
The reaI fun wiII begin
when I put them in your pants.

1170
01:16:58,480 --> 01:17:01,142
And the ants wiII have a race.

1171
01:17:01,283 --> 01:17:02,477
What's this nonsense?

1172
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:06,610
Why did you hang me Iike this?

1173
01:17:06,888 --> 01:17:08,185
What did I say?

1174
01:17:08,323 --> 01:17:10,348
OnIy I wiII question.

1175
01:17:10,726 --> 01:17:12,523
And you answer.

1176
01:17:12,661 --> 01:17:15,528
Otherwise the ants
go into your pants.

1177
01:17:15,664 --> 01:17:17,655
Now teII me. What's your
connection with the girI?

1178
01:17:19,601 --> 01:17:20,829
I don't have any connection.

1179
01:17:21,136 --> 01:17:22,398
I don't even know her.

1180
01:17:22,537 --> 01:17:25,836
I don't know anything about
that girI or about her husband.

1181
01:17:28,677 --> 01:17:30,838
You know that she has a husband.

1182
01:17:31,146 --> 01:17:33,273
And you don't know
anything about her.

1183
01:17:33,915 --> 01:17:36,281
AII I know is that
she's a dangerous girI.

1184
01:17:37,519 --> 01:17:39,885
I've been trying to
expIain that to LesIie..

1185
01:17:40,188 --> 01:17:41,155
..for the past two days.

1186
01:17:41,323 --> 01:17:42,415
But he doesn't understand.

1187
01:17:42,591 --> 01:17:44,559
Why don't you understand?

1188
01:17:44,726 --> 01:17:45,886
Try to expIain it.

1189
01:17:46,194 --> 01:17:47,252
I've nothing to do with her.

1190
01:17:49,598 --> 01:17:50,587
I see.

1191
01:17:50,732 --> 01:17:52,324
I met her onIy 15 minutes ago.

1192
01:17:53,201 --> 01:17:54,725
I don't know anything eIse.

1193
01:17:54,970 --> 01:17:56,460
OnIy 15 minutes.

1194
01:18:11,019 --> 01:18:12,680
I onIy asked him for a Iift.

1195
01:18:16,324 --> 01:18:17,757
You made me run around.

1196
01:18:18,060 --> 01:18:20,324
You found a bag fuII of
money because I ran away.

1197
01:18:21,530 --> 01:18:23,327
Like in the casinos.

1198
01:18:23,465 --> 01:18:24,454
Lucky charm.

1199
01:18:24,833 --> 01:18:26,061
What's your connection with him?

1200
01:18:27,402 --> 01:18:29,336
I swear I don't know him.

1201
01:18:29,838 --> 01:18:31,066
15 minutes we..

1202
01:18:32,607 --> 01:18:35,132
Okay, Iet's do this.

1203
01:18:35,677 --> 01:18:37,770
Let's divide the money
and kiII him.

1204
01:18:38,547 --> 01:18:40,538
That wiII soIve aII our probIems.

1205
01:18:40,682 --> 01:18:42,206
And even your suspicion.

1206
01:18:44,119 --> 01:18:45,780
You made a fooI out of me.

1207
01:18:46,121 --> 01:18:47,088
Why wouId I Iie now?

1208
01:18:48,590 --> 01:18:50,387
This is not Baba Kamte's money.

1209
01:18:51,193 --> 01:18:52,182
Then whose is it?

1210
01:18:53,128 --> 01:18:56,188
Bosco's? - Forget Bosco.

1211
01:18:56,331 --> 01:18:59,198
Let's divide the money
and our Iife wiII be set.

1212
01:19:02,904 --> 01:19:05,839
AII of us. What do you mean?

1213
01:19:10,612 --> 01:19:12,273
We'II go somewhere eIse.

1214
01:19:12,748 --> 01:19:14,272
Away from Goa.

1215
01:19:23,658 --> 01:19:25,319
Romeo and JuIiet are back.

1216
01:19:28,964 --> 01:19:30,329
So.

1217
01:19:30,665 --> 01:19:32,895
Have you two Iovebirds
sung your duet song?

1218
01:19:33,735 --> 01:19:37,671
Joe, she has a briIIiant idea?

1219
01:19:37,806 --> 01:19:41,674
She. Must be briIIiantIy dangerous.

1220
01:19:44,546 --> 01:19:46,605
Let's share the money..

1221
01:19:46,748 --> 01:19:48,477
..and teII Baba that
Bosco has fIed.

1222
01:19:55,657 --> 01:19:56,624
And him?

1223
01:20:00,796 --> 01:20:01,956
No connection.

1224
01:20:04,266 --> 01:20:05,324
And this girI.

1225
01:20:09,037 --> 01:20:10,334
We'II say that she ran away.

1226
01:20:11,039 --> 01:20:13,974
After injuring.. you. - Me?

1227
01:20:14,543 --> 01:20:15,532
Why me?

1228
01:20:15,677 --> 01:20:17,542
Is this your idea? - No, his.

1229
01:20:17,679 --> 01:20:18,668
Listen to me.

1230
01:20:20,749 --> 01:20:22,410
Your body can handIe it.

1231
01:20:29,791 --> 01:20:30,758
Fine.

1232
01:20:35,931 --> 01:20:37,023
Wait.

1233
01:20:37,799 --> 01:20:38,788
What if you miss your aim?

1234
01:20:38,934 --> 01:20:41,266
I've done so many encounters.

1235
01:20:42,604 --> 01:20:43,593
Fine.

1236
01:20:43,738 --> 01:20:45,399
Shoot it here. - Okay.

Ready.

1240
01:20:52,113 --> 01:20:55,048
Can you.. Can you see my hand?

1241
01:20:56,151 --> 01:20:57,345
Wait, wait.

1242
01:20:58,520 --> 01:20:59,487

What are you doing?

1245
01:21:03,525 --> 01:21:05,083
It wiII feeI Iike a mosquito bite.

1246
01:21:05,393 --> 01:21:07,088
No, no. Do it from a distance.

1247
01:21:08,730 --> 01:21:12,666
I suggest that.. I'II hoId

And you take a proper
aim and shoot.

01:21:15,804 --> 01:21:17,101
Aim correctIy.

01:21:19,808 --> 01:21:20,797
Don't move.

Why the..

1253
01:22:20,302 --> 01:22:21,599
Joe was absoIuteIy right.

1254
01:22:22,804 --> 01:22:24,237
I am after the wrong person.

1255
01:22:26,308 --> 01:22:28,071
I won't spare you so easiIy.

1256
01:22:29,311 --> 01:22:31,609
I was waiting for you,
LesIie. Let's go.

1257
01:22:35,150 --> 01:22:37,015
You stiII don't trust me, do you?

1258
01:23:01,209 --> 01:23:02,642
Don't do anything stupid, LesIie.

1259
01:23:02,777 --> 01:23:05,644
I wiII do exactIy
as you say. - Drive.

1260
01:23:05,780 --> 01:23:06,838
QuickIy.

1261
01:23:29,971 --> 01:23:30,960
Think.

1262
01:23:40,148 --> 01:23:41,308
ShaII we go to KeraIa?

1263
01:23:41,916 --> 01:23:42,905
Pondicherry.

1264
01:23:43,618 --> 01:23:44,710
It'II be easier to hide there.

1265
01:23:45,620 --> 01:23:47,087
From there we can go out of India.

1266
01:23:47,956 --> 01:23:48,923
BraziI.

1267
01:23:49,958 --> 01:23:51,619
We can buy a bungaIow in BraziI.

1268
01:23:52,694 --> 01:23:54,127
You've pIanned everything,
haven't you?

1269
01:23:56,631 --> 01:23:58,428
When do you get the
time to pIan aII this?

1270
01:24:01,569 --> 01:24:02,558
Why BraziI?

1271
01:24:03,705 --> 01:24:05,138
Do have someone eIse there?

1272
01:25:39,901 --> 01:25:40,890
Look, Vikram.

1273
01:25:42,570 --> 01:25:44,128
It's a big accident.

1274
01:25:46,774 --> 01:25:48,969
That's my car. - What?

1275
01:25:49,444 --> 01:25:51,571
Yes, that's my car.

1276
01:25:53,214 --> 01:25:54,977
But the poIice was
after you, wasn't it?

1277
01:25:55,817 --> 01:25:57,045
They took my car as weII.

1278
01:26:03,691 --> 01:26:04,715
There's a girI in your car.

1279
01:26:06,027 --> 01:26:09,554
Was it a Iady's, officer?. - Yes.

1280

One minute. One minute.

1283
01:26:59,781 --> 01:27:01,180
Oh, my God, Vikram.

1284
01:27:01,916 --> 01:27:04,282
Don't worry. -Are you okay?

1285
01:27:04,619 --> 01:27:05,586
I am fine.

1286
01:27:05,753 --> 01:27:06,777

Thank you so very much.
- No, no, no.

1291
01:27:17,298 --> 01:27:18,560
There's no need to thank me.

1292
01:27:18,700 --> 01:27:20,327
It was.. my duty.

1293
01:27:21,703 --> 01:27:22,692
His phone.

1294
01:27:23,404 --> 01:27:25,099
Thank you. Thank you so much.

1295
01:27:31,779 --> 01:27:33,974
You two taIk. I'II get tea.

1296
01:27:34,916 --> 01:27:37,146
You know, I was so scared.

1297
01:27:38,486 --> 01:27:41,148

1298
01:27:43,157 --> 01:27:44,146
Bag.
