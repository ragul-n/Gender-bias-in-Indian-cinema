1
00:02:56,356 --> 00:02:58,415
Vishal, please pass the towel.

2
00:02:59,025 --> 00:03:01,391
Anjali, how do you forget
the towel everyday?

3
00:03:03,029 --> 00:03:04,291
When you have many things
to remember..

4
00:03:04,364 --> 00:03:07,299
..then you tend to forget
certain things.

5
00:03:08,602 --> 00:03:11,298
You always have amazing answers!

6
00:03:15,809 --> 00:03:16,867
Nikki!

7
00:03:18,011 --> 00:03:19,308
God! You are still sleeping!

8
00:03:20,847 --> 00:03:23,042
You are getting late! Good morning!

9
00:03:24,751 --> 00:03:26,048
Good morning!

10
00:03:27,587 --> 00:03:31,421
Actually.. no need to
go to school today.

11
00:03:32,058 --> 00:03:35,323
Mummy has said to let Nikki
sleep. Don`t wake her up.

12
00:03:36,329 --> 00:03:37,421
Today is Sunday!

13
00:03:37,931 --> 00:03:41,059

00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:09,092
lt`s wrong.
- What`s wrong?

24
00:04:09,162 --> 00:04:10,356
Nikki`s last answer!

25
00:04:14,634 --> 00:04:17,501
Hello! - Hello, Mr. Vishal! Dr.
Mathur will speak to you!

26
00:04:17,571 --> 00:04:19,971
Yeah. Give it to him.
Call from the hospital.

27
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,871
Nikki`s sugar level is normal.

28
00:04:21,942 --> 00:04:25,469
Hello. - Hi, doctor. - Hi. How is
Nikki? - Sugar level is normal.

29
00:04:25,545 --> 00:04:27,103
That`s good!
- Yeah!

30
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,114
So continue with the same
prescription. Okay.

31
00:04:29,182 --> 00:04:30,740
Alright! Alright!
- l will call back in a week again.

32
00:04:30,817 --> 00:04:31,943
Thank you. Thank you.

33
00:04:33,453 --> 00:04:35,546
Doctor has said to continue
with the new medicine.

34
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:40,050
Dad! Mama, is right!

35
00:04:42,529 --> 00:04:45,862
Yes! Mama is always right!
Mama can never be wrong.

36
00:04:45,932 --> 00:04:50,767
Nikki, don`t ever praise me in
front of dad. He doesn`t like it.

37
00:04:51,438 --> 00:04:52,928
Did l feel bad?

38
00:04:54,674 --> 00:04:57,575
Vishal, l am taking money
from your wallet.

39
00:04:57,644 --> 00:04:58,804
You withdraw it from the ATM.

40
00:05:03,049 --> 00:05:05,415
Bye, baby!
- Bye, mama!

41
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:11,718
Dad, nowadays you don`t
kiss mama goodbye.

42
00:05:12,892 --> 00:05:13,950
What to do?

43
00:05:14,094 --> 00:05:18,724
Nowadays your mummy doesn`t
give me the chance to kiss.

44
00:06:19,059 --> 00:06:22,927
Your ticket please!
- Here! - Your ticket!

45
00:06:27,133 --> 00:06:29,829
Excuse me! Your ticket or

46
00:06:33,773 --> 00:06:35,240
Here you go!
- Thank you!

47
00:06:36,509 --> 00:06:39,501
lt`s expired! You have to

48
00:06:40,246 --> 00:06:44,046
Money?
- Yeah! l have no money. l am sorry.

49
00:06:44,117 --> 00:06:46,950
l am sorry. You have to pay.
Or please get down.

50
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,987
l will get late for work!
- Please get down!

51
00:06:49,055 --> 00:06:50,249
l am very, very sorry, sir!

52
00:06:50,323 --> 00:06:53,986
You have to pay the difference!
- Sir.. - Excuse me, sir.

53
00:06:55,729 --> 00:06:58,254
lt`s okay. l will pay for him.
- No, it`s alright.

54
00:06:58,331 --> 00:06:59,559
That`s alright.

55
00:07:00,667 --> 00:07:02,931
You don`t..
- Yes, ma`am.

56
00:07:03,002 --> 00:07:06,529
One to crossroads.
- 60 bucks, ma`am.

57
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:08,271
There you go.

58
00:07:09,242 --> 00:07:11,005
Your ticket please!
- There you go!

59
00:07:11,077 --> 00:07:12,544
Thank you!

60
00:07:15,048 --> 00:07:16,276
Excuse me! Your ticket please!

61
00:07:25,692 --> 00:07:26,750
lndian?

62
00:07:28,561 --> 00:07:29,619
Yes.

63
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:32,564
But even if l had not been lndian..

64
00:07:32,632 --> 00:07:34,156
..l would have done the same thing.

65
00:07:34,567 --> 00:07:36,558
ls it necessary to belong
to the same..

66
00:07:36,636 --> 00:07:38,126
..country to help somebody?

67
00:07:39,172 --> 00:07:44,200
No, for that you need helping
nature. And you have that nature.

68
00:07:44,811 --> 00:07:46,608
Otherwise nowadays people don`t..

69
00:07:46,679 --> 00:07:48,579
l think its not right to form
opinion about a person..

70
00:07:48,648 --> 00:07:50,946
..in the first meeting itself.

71
00:07:52,952 --> 00:07:55,079
No. That depends on the meeting.

72
00:07:57,090 --> 00:07:58,580
l will repay your money
in the next station..

73
00:07:58,658 --> 00:08:00,125
..by withdrawing from the ATM.

74
00:08:00,193 --> 00:08:02,593
lt`s okay. lts just 60 bucks.

75
00:08:02,662 --> 00:08:05,187
No, loan is a loan.

76
00:08:05,265 --> 00:08:06,596
And till the time the
loan is not repaid..

77
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:08,793
..it weighs heavy on the conscience.

78
00:08:09,836 --> 00:08:12,270
And l don`t..
- Want any burden.

79
00:08:13,606 --> 00:08:17,201
Fine! Give it tomorrow.

80
00:08:19,012 --> 00:08:26,942
But.. with 9.5% interest.. and
10% handling fees. Okay?

81
00:08:31,157 --> 00:08:33,022
lt will be difficult to calculate.

82
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:36,051
Leave that on me. That`s my work.

83
00:08:36,362 --> 00:08:39,058
l am a financial consultant.
ln HB finance.

84
00:08:42,268 --> 00:08:43,360

Vishal Dixit. GM in ad agency.

86
00:08:49,976 --> 00:08:52,877
lt means you try to sell
what doesn`t sell.

87
00:08:52,946 --> 00:08:56,313
No, l try to increase the demand
of less demandable products.

88
00:08:56,716 --> 00:08:57,808
Alright.

89
00:09:07,026 --> 00:09:08,823
Anyway. l will see you.

90
00:09:10,029 --> 00:09:11,155
Bye.

00:09:11,231 --> 00:09:14,689
But your money?

92
00:09:34,854 --> 00:09:36,253
Good morning.

00:09:36,322 --> 00:09:37,380

Any messages?
- No messages.

96
00:09:43,263 --> 00:09:45,094
Where`s Charlie?
- Charlie..

97
00:09:48,968 --> 00:09:53,428
Charlie! My name is Charlie! l

98
00:09:53,506 --> 00:09:56,998
Don`t fool me! Understand!

99
00:09:57,110 --> 00:10:00,102
l am sitting in Bangkok! And
it`s raining in Mumbai!

100
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:01,779
Get lost!

101
00:10:02,715 --> 00:10:04,876
Tell me. What is it? ls
it a cricket match?

102
00:10:05,451 --> 00:10:07,112
That`s great! Whose?

103
00:10:08,855 --> 00:10:10,345
Zimbabwe and Bangladesh.

104
00:10:11,824 --> 00:10:13,257
Both the teams will lose. Next.

105
00:10:13,326 --> 00:10:15,419
lf there is any other
match. Tell me.

106
00:10:17,864 --> 00:10:20,128
Sri Lanka. lndia. Sri Lanka. lndia.

107
00:10:20,199 --> 00:10:24,135
Chaminda Vaas. He is a
bad player! How much?

108
00:10:24,203 --> 00:10:26,137
10,000 rupees! -10,000 rupees!

109
00:10:26,205 --> 00:10:27,729
That`s great! 10,000 rupees!

110
00:10:31,477 --> 00:10:32,739
Good morning, boss!

111
00:10:32,812 --> 00:10:35,144
l.. l was asking the score.

112
00:10:35,214 --> 00:10:36,272
The match is tomorrow.

113
00:10:36,349 --> 00:10:41,309
But.. l was asking the score
of the net practice.

114
00:10:42,755 --> 00:10:46,748
Charlie, reform! And stop
betting in my cabin!

115
00:10:47,293 --> 00:10:51,093
lf the boss found out
then.. You know!

116
00:10:51,164 --> 00:10:54,827
Boss has still not found out,
then why will he find out now?

117
00:10:54,901 --> 00:10:57,495
He shouldn`t know!
- Vishal, boss is calling you.

118
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:02,034
Please don`t tell him, boss.
- Later.

119
00:11:02,108 --> 00:11:04,508
When boss doesn`t know,
why to trouble him, boss?

120
00:11:05,578 --> 00:11:07,273
Boss is a boss!

121
00:11:07,347 --> 00:11:08,507
Boss, too!

122
00:11:10,049 --> 00:11:11,243
`Go, get it!`

123
00:11:11,317 --> 00:11:14,184
Hello! What was l saying?

124
00:11:14,253 --> 00:11:17,518
Yes! Yes! Not Sachin! l am Charlie!

125
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:18,921
You are right!

126
00:11:18,992 --> 00:11:21,790
But the concept that works
best for our campaign..

127
00:11:21,861 --> 00:11:24,125
..is the one l..
- Good morning!

128
00:11:24,197 --> 00:11:29,066
Sunil! Ms. Nadia! Sorry l am late!

129
00:11:31,904 --> 00:11:34,805
So.. Ms. Nadia, the ad
that l have conceived..

130
00:11:34,874 --> 00:11:37,809
..it will make your product
famous in the market.

131
00:11:37,877 --> 00:11:39,139
When you will see the ad then..

132
00:11:39,212 --> 00:11:42,943
Vishal, Nadia has seen your ad.

133
00:11:45,284 --> 00:11:47,047
Yeah! So what do you think?

134
00:11:50,356 --> 00:11:52,017
l think you are a genius.

135
00:11:56,162 --> 00:11:57,254
Thanks. Why?

136
00:11:57,330 --> 00:12:02,563
Vishal! l think first listen to
what Nadia has to say. - Okay.

137
00:12:03,503 --> 00:12:06,836
Vishal, l called you a genius..
because l couldn`t..

138
00:12:06,906 --> 00:12:11,400
..understand your this concept too!

139
00:12:14,514 --> 00:12:16,573
My product is for ordinary people.

140
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:20,147
And ordinary people won`t be able
to understand your concept!

141
00:12:22,255 --> 00:12:23,586
Ms. Nadia, you..

142
00:12:23,656 --> 00:12:28,286
No more discussions, Vishal!
You can`t give what l want.

143
00:12:30,296 --> 00:12:35,962
You know what.. l think
you need a break.

144
00:12:36,569 --> 00:12:40,938
So that you can come out of your
illusion of being a genius.

145
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:46,578
Ms. Nadia, l have no illusions.

146
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:49,341
You are the one who has illusions
and who is confused.

147
00:12:51,284 --> 00:12:53,411
You yourself don`t
know what you want.

148
00:12:53,619 --> 00:12:56,247
l have been working in this ad
agency for the past 10 years.

149
00:12:56,322 --> 00:12:58,085
And l have never seen a more
confused client than you!

150
00:12:58,157 --> 00:13:00,091
Vishal! Vishal, that`s enough!
That`s enough!

151
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:01,956
Not l, but you need a break!

152
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:05,898
Sorry, guys! Excuse me!

153
00:13:08,568 --> 00:13:10,627
Sorry! l am sorry! l apologise
on his behalf!

154
00:13:23,649 --> 00:13:24,911
Vishal!

155
00:13:30,423 --> 00:13:32,653
You shouldn`t have insulted
Nadia like this.

156
00:13:32,725 --> 00:13:34,249
And she can insult me!

157
00:13:34,327 --> 00:13:36,522
She is the client! She
pays the Goddamn bills!

158
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:40,931
Look, Vishal. For the
past few months..

159
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,434
..you seem to be totally
out of form.

160
00:13:43,936 --> 00:13:46,666
l don`t know what it is. But
there is something missing.

161
00:13:49,542 --> 00:13:52,670
l know you are worried about
your daughter`s ailment.

162
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:55,072
And with your talks and laughter..

163
00:13:55,148 --> 00:13:57,412
..you are trying to cover
up your worries.

164
00:13:57,683 --> 00:13:59,378
But it`s all showing, Vishal.

165
00:13:59,685 --> 00:14:01,619
Your work is being affected!

166
00:14:02,021 --> 00:14:04,683
And this is dangerous in
the advertising world!

167
00:14:06,259 --> 00:14:08,090
Here you don`t get the chance
to rectify your mistakes.

168
00:14:08,394 --> 00:14:11,591
Here people give money..
but not choice.

169
00:14:14,066 --> 00:14:18,526
Maybe you would like to
think about that. Jatab!

170
00:14:18,604 --> 00:14:20,231
Yes!
- Get him a cup of coffee!

171
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:56,108
What`s the matter? You got late.

172
00:15:05,618 --> 00:15:07,586
You know what Ms. Nadia told me?
- What?

173
00:15:07,653 --> 00:15:09,746
That l have the illusion
of being a genius.

174
00:15:13,259 --> 00:15:16,751
And Sudhir was saying for the past
few months l am not in form.

175
00:15:16,829 --> 00:15:18,126
Can you believe that?

176
00:15:18,197 --> 00:15:21,462
Vishal, why do you bring
office tension at home?

177
00:15:21,601 --> 00:15:26,629
Do l do that? lt happens. lt
happens in all professions.

178
00:15:26,772 --> 00:15:30,765
lt`s natural. Anyway,
l have kept the food.

179
00:15:30,843 --> 00:15:34,370
Warm it and eat it. l am going.
- Where?

180
00:15:35,781 --> 00:15:38,272
To attend parents and teachers
association meeting.

181
00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:41,577
ls it today?

182
00:15:41,654 --> 00:15:43,554
For the past 15 days l have
stuck the note on the fridge.

183
00:15:43,689 --> 00:15:48,092
Vishal, l only forget to
take the towel. But you..

184
00:15:50,463 --> 00:15:51,521
Bye!

185
00:16:04,176 --> 00:16:06,736
Rainbows have 7 colours.
- True.

186
00:16:08,481 --> 00:16:09,812
Cow is a wild animal.

187
00:16:13,486 --> 00:16:14,544
False.

188
00:16:15,755 --> 00:16:18,246
Wale is a mammal.
- False.

189
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:20,817
True!

190
00:16:23,195 --> 00:16:26,096
Fish will die without water.
- True.

191
00:16:28,467 --> 00:16:34,099
Papa.. if this dialysis
machine stopped working..

192
00:16:34,173 --> 00:16:36,107
..then will l also die?

193
00:16:41,714 --> 00:16:42,772
Let`s see.

194
00:16:46,786 --> 00:16:47,844
Anything happened?

195
00:16:49,322 --> 00:16:51,119
Then it`s false.

196
00:16:52,224 --> 00:16:54,658
l too will not let anything
happen to you. Understand!

197
00:16:55,394 --> 00:16:57,123
Now don`t watch TV for long.

198
00:16:57,196 --> 00:16:58,527
Otherwise mummy will
get mad! Understand!

199
00:16:58,597 --> 00:16:59,655
Give me a kiss.

200
00:17:01,801 --> 00:17:02,859
Goodnight!

201
00:17:13,479 --> 00:17:18,473
`Papa.. if this dialysis
machine stopped working..

202
00:17:18,551 --> 00:17:19,813
..then will l also die?`

203
00:17:29,895 --> 00:17:31,795
Vishal, do you know
what happened today?

204
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:35,894
Vishal!

205
00:17:39,205 --> 00:17:40,536
What happened?

206
00:17:44,377 --> 00:17:46,174
Something has really happened
to me, Anjali!

207
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:55,386
And Nikki`s ailment is
not the only reason.

208
00:17:57,823 --> 00:17:58,881
You are right!

209
00:18:00,192 --> 00:18:02,558
Maybe something has happened
to both of us!

210
00:18:04,497 --> 00:18:06,192
Knowingly unknowingly we have..

211
00:18:06,265 --> 00:18:08,460
..created a glass
barrier between us.

212
00:18:09,301 --> 00:18:11,201
We can see each other.

213
00:18:11,837 --> 00:18:13,805
But we can`t feel each other.

214
00:18:15,741 --> 00:18:18,209
Or maybe we are moving so fast..

215
00:18:18,277 --> 00:18:20,939
..that we are not at
pace with each other.

216
00:18:23,349 --> 00:18:27,376
At times you are ahead.
At times l am ahead.

217
00:18:32,224 --> 00:18:34,419
Today in the morning
Nikki was asking me..

218
00:18:36,796 --> 00:18:41,563
..that nowadays why don`t
l kiss you goodbye.

219
00:18:42,802 --> 00:18:43,894
So what did you say?

220
00:18:44,837 --> 00:18:50,241
That.. nowadays mummy doesn`t
give me the chance.

221
00:18:53,446 --> 00:18:59,544
Vishal.. you don`t give
chance you have to take it.

222
00:20:20,933 --> 00:20:27,065
The moments spent..

223
00:20:40,352 --> 00:20:45,415
Even if just for a few moments.

224
00:20:45,491 --> 00:20:51,088
l had experienced a happy life.

225
00:20:51,163 --> 00:20:57,466
ln your arms, l spend my dawns.

226
00:20:57,570 --> 00:21:04,806
ln your arms, l spend
my twilights.

227
00:21:09,748 --> 00:21:15,380
Today too when l remember
those moments.

228
00:21:15,521 --> 00:21:21,426
All my sorrows get alleviated.

229
00:21:21,493 --> 00:21:27,523
Even in pain, there is
a smile on my lips.

230
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:33,835
Whenever l remember
the past moments.

231
00:21:58,530 --> 00:22:04,093
Once upon a time the sky was
blue beneath these roads.

232
00:22:04,169 --> 00:22:10,130
l could give the whole world
just for your smile.

233
00:22:10,209 --> 00:22:18,639
l would remain lost in your
eyes for the whole night.

234
00:22:21,687 --> 00:22:27,557
ln your arms, l spend my dawns.

235
00:22:27,626 --> 00:22:33,724
ln your arms, l spend
my twilights.

236
00:22:39,538 --> 00:22:45,534
Today too when l remember
those moments.

237
00:22:45,611 --> 00:22:51,481
All my sorrows get alleviated.

238
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:57,511
Even in pain, there is
a smile on my lips.

239
00:22:57,589 --> 00:23:03,528
Whenever l remember
the past moments.

240
00:23:39,965 --> 00:23:45,528
Your placing the head
on my shoulder.

241
00:23:45,604 --> 00:23:51,270
Your hiding in my chest.

242
00:23:51,677 --> 00:23:57,616
Your placing the head
on my shoulder.

243
00:23:57,683 --> 00:24:03,280
Your hiding in my chest.

244
00:24:03,655 --> 00:24:09,560
Coming in my shelter
dawn and dusk.

245
00:24:09,695 --> 00:24:15,861
Your breaking like glass.

246
00:24:21,707 --> 00:24:27,577
Today too when l see
those destinations.

247
00:24:27,713 --> 00:24:33,583
lt alleviates the loneliness
of my heart.

248
00:24:33,685 --> 00:24:39,317
Even in pain, there is
a smile on my lips.

249
00:24:39,591 --> 00:24:45,587
Whenever l remember
the past moments.

250
00:24:45,664 --> 00:24:51,330
Even in pain, there is
a smile on my lips.

251
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:57,336
Whenever l remember
the past moments.

252
00:24:57,409 --> 00:25:01,004
Even in pain..

253
00:25:03,348 --> 00:25:07,341
The past moments..

254
00:25:09,354 --> 00:25:13,085
Even in pain..

255
00:25:14,726 --> 00:25:20,255
The past moments..

256
00:25:37,683 --> 00:25:39,651
Hi!
- Hi

257
00:25:40,652 --> 00:25:42,643
So have you calculated how much..

258
00:25:42,721 --> 00:25:44,018
..is your interest after
handling fees?

259
00:25:46,291 --> 00:25:49,783
Our company doesn`t charge interest
to honest customers.

260
00:25:50,262 --> 00:25:52,662
As far as handling
fees is concerned..

261
00:25:52,731 --> 00:25:55,666
..treat me with a nice cup
of coffee and repay it.

262
00:25:55,934 --> 00:25:56,992
Sure.

263
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:03,367
Here.
- Your daughter?

264
00:26:04,343 --> 00:26:06,004
Nikki.
- How sweet!

265
00:26:06,111 --> 00:26:08,409
My daughter is almost of that age!

266
00:26:11,083 --> 00:26:13,142
Cute!
- Yeah! She is!

267
00:26:13,218 --> 00:26:15,186
What`s her name?
- lshita.

268
00:26:15,821 --> 00:26:19,416
She is my soul! She is a nice
kid! She never harasses me!

269
00:26:20,025 --> 00:26:23,984
But handling her alone..
can be quite a handful!

270
00:26:25,998 --> 00:26:28,023
Meaning you..

271
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:29,761
No, l am not a divorcee.

272
00:26:29,835 --> 00:26:32,963
And my husband`s health too
is by God`s grace fine.

273
00:26:33,038 --> 00:26:35,097
He is always busy in his work.

274
00:26:35,173 --> 00:26:37,038
And l too can`t give him much time.

275
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:39,969
You know the nature of job is such!

276
00:26:41,113 --> 00:26:45,982
l swear satisfying these clients
is next to impossible!

277
00:26:46,051 --> 00:26:48,451
Somebody always has some complains.

278
00:26:49,922 --> 00:26:53,449
You are right! l mean..
- You can be informal.

279
00:26:53,525 --> 00:26:55,117
l think this is the
state in every field.

280
00:26:55,928 --> 00:26:57,725
Yesterday only l had an
argument with my client.

281
00:26:57,796 --> 00:26:59,423
She doesn`t know what she wants.

282
00:26:59,498 --> 00:27:01,022
And she says l don`t understand
the concept.

283
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:03,727
Boss too was praising her only.

284
00:27:03,869 --> 00:27:06,167
l know. She must be rich.

285
00:27:06,471 --> 00:27:09,065
But these bosses too.. l swear!

286
00:27:09,341 --> 00:27:11,138
You know, actually l
feel pity for them.

287
00:27:11,209 --> 00:27:12,733
They have to come first
in the office..

288
00:27:12,811 --> 00:27:14,472
..to know who is on
time and who is late.

289
00:27:17,816 --> 00:27:22,048
Anyway.. l will take your leave
now. l am late for work. - Okay.

290
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:24,281
So l will see you soon.
- Bye. - Bye-bye!

291
00:27:31,496 --> 00:27:33,828
Baby food! For healthy babies!

292
00:27:33,899 --> 00:27:37,835
Look after your baby.. with
this nutritious baby food!

293
00:27:37,903 --> 00:27:38,961
Hi! Hi! Later! Later!

294
00:27:39,037 --> 00:27:40,766
6 months to 12 months.
- What is going on here?

295
00:27:40,839 --> 00:27:43,774
Baby food! For healthy babies!
- Your baby food! Hang on!

296
00:27:43,842 --> 00:27:46,242
Move this! Get lost!

297
00:27:46,311 --> 00:27:49,769
What is this, Sam?
- Sir, boss said that this shoot..

298
00:27:49,848 --> 00:27:52,874
ls this the way to shoot? You
should have some idea, man!

299
00:27:52,951 --> 00:27:56,079
But sir.. - Make them wear bikinis!
- But sir, boss said..

300
00:27:56,154 --> 00:27:59,920
Boss said.. if you want to sell,
then use bikini. Understand!

301
00:27:59,992 --> 00:28:01,289
Don`t try to teach me!

302
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,294
Go and see whether Maya
is in the office or not!

303
00:28:03,362 --> 00:28:05,125
But sir, boss..
- Go!

304
00:28:05,797 --> 00:28:07,458
Listen to me, ladies and gentlemen!

305
00:28:07,532 --> 00:28:09,466
Who will be the model? Lights off!

306
00:28:10,535 --> 00:28:13,333
Move! Okay, ladies! Pay attention
over here! Pay attention!

307
00:28:13,405 --> 00:28:15,270
Hold the babies food
like this in hand!

308
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:18,309
And walk! Nice and sexy! Baby food!

309
00:28:19,811 --> 00:28:21,540
Okay! Yeah! Okay! Got it!

310
00:28:21,613 --> 00:28:23,877
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Action!

311
00:28:59,284 --> 00:29:01,184
Cut! Cut! Cut! Lights!

312
00:29:01,253 --> 00:29:03,585
Cut! Cut! Quiet!

313
00:29:03,655 --> 00:29:08,115
Do l look fine? Or shall l too
remove my clothes like them?

314
00:29:08,193 --> 00:29:10,991
Boss, you are joking!
You look handsome!

315
00:29:11,063 --> 00:29:13,031
This is the scene when
its baby food`s ad!

316
00:29:13,098 --> 00:29:14,156
l don`t know what would have been..

317
00:29:14,232 --> 00:29:15,324
..the scene had it been beer`s ad.

318
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,867
Boss, it would have been
very interesting!

319
00:29:16,935 --> 00:29:19,870
Shut up! Get out of my sight!

320
00:29:22,174 --> 00:29:25,234
And you all.. change this and
get into your other costumes.

321
00:29:26,378 --> 00:29:27,868
l want to see you in my office!

322
00:29:29,281 --> 00:29:30,475
Office!

323
00:29:31,917 --> 00:29:35,284
l told you to say cut
if boss comes here!

324
00:29:36,922 --> 00:29:40,289
l said when boss comes, say cut!
You don`t understand?

325
00:29:44,162 --> 00:29:45,220
ldiot!

326
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:39,678
Boss, the shot is ready.

327
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,178
Okay.

328
00:30:43,255 --> 00:30:44,950
Charlie!
- Yes, boss!

329
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:51,054
ln your gambling..
do you win or lose?

330
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:54,325
At times l win, at times l lose.

331
00:30:54,466 --> 00:30:56,525
But both have their own fun!

332
00:30:56,601 --> 00:31:01,004
Boss, you should take some risk in
life! Otherwise life is no fun, boss!

333
00:31:01,072 --> 00:31:06,977
People say.. boss, to be cool in
life.. you have to be useless.

334
00:31:09,614 --> 00:31:14,176
Boss, your mood seems to
be good. So sign here.

335
00:31:14,252 --> 00:31:15,981
Today l have to submit it
in the police station.

336
00:31:16,054 --> 00:31:17,715
Please! One sign here! Please!

337
00:31:17,789 --> 00:31:21,657
l know! That`s why l always
tell you to reform.

338
00:31:23,328 --> 00:31:26,092
Do you want to go to prison again?
- No!

339
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,292
Thank you, boss.

340
00:31:30,068 --> 00:31:32,002
The models are ready! Everybody
is wearing sari!

341
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:33,128
Thank God!

342
00:31:35,006 --> 00:31:38,305
And yes, boss.. don`t forget.
Tonight is big boss`s party!

343
00:31:38,376 --> 00:31:39,707
Thank you! Thank you!

344
00:31:40,011 --> 00:31:43,003
Come! Come! Welcome! Welcome!

345
00:31:43,081 --> 00:31:45,743
Hi! - Happy anniversary,
boss! - Thank you!

346
00:31:45,817 --> 00:31:47,307
How are you?
- l am fine.

347
00:31:47,452 --> 00:31:50,012
Vishal, do you know?
- Looking very pretty!

348
00:31:50,088 --> 00:31:52,022
What is the difference between..

349
00:31:52,090 --> 00:31:53,284
..marriage and life imprisonment?
- What?

350
00:31:53,358 --> 00:31:54,655
There is a difference.

351
00:31:54,726 --> 00:31:57,593
ln life imprisonment, the convict
is released after 14 years.

352
00:31:57,662 --> 00:32:01,029
There is still time.
You can divorce me.

353
00:32:01,099 --> 00:32:04,159
lt`s too late! lts 7 o`clock.
The court must be closed.

354
00:32:05,403 --> 00:32:07,769
But why do you think like
this about marriage?

355
00:32:07,839 --> 00:32:09,033
Marriage is that amazing
thing that..

356
00:32:09,107 --> 00:32:11,132
..brings two strangers together.

357
00:32:11,209 --> 00:32:15,771
No, after marriage,
strangers become kin.

358
00:32:15,847 --> 00:32:17,439
And kin, strangers. Am l right?

359
00:32:17,582 --> 00:32:20,050
Believe me! l have experienced it.

360
00:32:20,118 --> 00:32:22,177
As you can see, we are
the living example.

361
00:32:23,622 --> 00:32:26,785
Now.. you can see her
sense of humour.

362
00:32:27,125 --> 00:32:30,788
14 years.. l have lived
with her sense of humour.

363
00:32:30,862 --> 00:32:32,591
Excuse me. l will just come.

364
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:49,803
Sorry, darling! This Verma is
a big bore! He talks too much!

365
00:32:50,815 --> 00:32:53,113
What happened? Something wrong?

366
00:32:54,219 --> 00:32:56,084
No.
- Are you sure? - Yeah!

367
00:32:58,356 --> 00:33:00,221
Come on! Let`s enjoy the party!

368
00:33:06,765 --> 00:33:09,825
That stranger. That stranger.

369
00:33:13,772 --> 00:33:14,830
That..

370
00:33:15,774 --> 00:33:16,832
That..

371
00:33:18,276 --> 00:33:19,334
That..

372
00:33:19,411 --> 00:33:21,379
That stranger.

373
00:33:38,129 --> 00:33:42,793
l have found such a person.
Such a person..

374
00:33:42,867 --> 00:33:47,201
She has made me forget the whole
world. The whole world.

375
00:33:47,372 --> 00:33:51,866
l have found such a person.
Such a person..

376
00:33:51,943 --> 00:33:55,845
She has made me forget
the whole world.

377
00:33:55,914 --> 00:33:58,439
That stranger. That stranger.

378
00:33:58,516 --> 00:34:00,211
She sees me from a distance.

379
00:34:00,352 --> 00:34:04,721
l see only her. Forgetting
everything.

380
00:34:04,823 --> 00:34:07,587
That stranger. That stranger.

381
00:34:07,659 --> 00:34:09,251
She sees me from a distance.

382
00:34:09,394 --> 00:34:13,888
l see only her. Forgetting
everything.

383
00:34:14,232 --> 00:34:16,700
ln my heartbeats or breaths.

384
00:34:16,768 --> 00:34:18,895
ln twilights or dreams.

385
00:34:18,970 --> 00:34:21,336
She is everywhere.

386
00:34:21,406 --> 00:34:23,237
Let me tell her that.

387
00:34:23,375 --> 00:34:25,707
ln dusks or dawns.

388
00:34:25,777 --> 00:34:28,177
She is present in every moment.

389
00:34:28,246 --> 00:34:30,476
Always in the talks.

390
00:34:30,548 --> 00:34:32,345
She is present.

391
00:34:32,417 --> 00:34:33,907
That..
- That stranger.

392
00:34:33,985 --> 00:34:37,318
That stranger. That stranger.
That stranger.

393
00:34:37,389 --> 00:34:38,447
That stranger.

394
00:34:38,523 --> 00:34:41,788
That stranger. That stranger.
That stranger.

395
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:43,589
That stranger.

396
00:34:43,661 --> 00:34:46,323
That stranger. That stranger.
That stranger.

397
00:34:46,398 --> 00:34:47,831
That.. that..

398
00:34:47,899 --> 00:34:51,198
That stranger. That stranger.
That stranger.

399
00:35:05,316 --> 00:35:09,776
l have formed such a bond
with him. Bond.. bond..

400
00:35:09,854 --> 00:35:14,223
l see him everywhere.
Everywhere.. everywhere..

401
00:35:14,292 --> 00:35:18,592
l have formed such a bond
with him. Bond.. bond..

402
00:35:18,663 --> 00:35:22,724
l see him everywhere.

403
00:35:22,801 --> 00:35:26,965
His beauty has made
my life bright.

404
00:35:27,038 --> 00:35:31,737
His love has given
me true happiness.

405
00:35:31,810 --> 00:35:36,247
Now l think about
him all the time.

406
00:35:36,314 --> 00:35:38,942
l always see him.

407
00:35:39,017 --> 00:35:41,349
My eyes are helpless.

408
00:35:41,419 --> 00:35:43,683
ln my heartbeats or breaths.

409
00:35:43,755 --> 00:35:45,848
ln twilights or dreams.

410
00:35:45,924 --> 00:35:48,256
She is everywhere.

411
00:35:48,326 --> 00:35:50,521
Let me tell her that.

412
00:35:50,595 --> 00:35:52,790
ln dusks or dawns.

413
00:35:52,864 --> 00:35:54,991
She is present in every moment.

414
00:35:55,066 --> 00:35:57,261
Always in the talks.

415
00:35:57,335 --> 00:35:59,326
She is present.

416
00:35:59,404 --> 00:36:02,703
That..
- That stranger.

417
00:36:02,774 --> 00:36:04,002
That stranger. That stranger.
That stranger.

418
00:36:04,075 --> 00:36:05,474
That stranger.

419
00:36:05,543 --> 00:36:08,740
That stranger. That stranger.
That stranger.

420
00:36:22,794 --> 00:36:27,458
l found him and l found the
whole world. Whole world.

421
00:36:27,532 --> 00:36:32,026
God, never separate him
from me. Separate.

422
00:36:32,103 --> 00:36:35,937
l found him and l found
the whole world.

423
00:36:36,674 --> 00:36:40,474
God, never separate him from me.

424
00:36:40,545 --> 00:36:44,845
Now she is included in my worship.

425
00:36:44,916 --> 00:36:49,353
Her love has given
me true happiness.

426
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:53,880
Now l think about
her all the time.

427
00:36:53,958 --> 00:36:56,722
l always see her.

428
00:36:56,794 --> 00:36:58,625
My eyes are helpless.

429
00:36:58,696 --> 00:37:00,323
That stranger.

430
00:37:00,398 --> 00:37:03,424
That stranger. That stranger.
That stranger.

431
00:37:03,501 --> 00:37:04,729
That stranger.

432
00:37:04,802 --> 00:37:07,930
That stranger. That stranger.
That stranger.

433
00:37:08,006 --> 00:37:09,337
That stranger.

434
00:37:09,407 --> 00:37:12,638
That stranger. That stranger.
That stranger.

435
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:13,972
That.. that..

436
00:37:14,045 --> 00:37:17,071
That stranger. That stranger.
That stranger.

437
00:37:29,861 --> 00:37:31,351
That stranger.

438
00:37:31,429 --> 00:37:34,523
That stranger. That stranger.
That stranger.

439
00:37:34,599 --> 00:37:35,793
That stranger.

440
00:37:50,748 --> 00:37:51,840
Mama!

441
00:37:53,585 --> 00:37:54,711
Mama!

442
00:37:55,019 --> 00:37:56,077
Anjali!

443
00:37:58,456 --> 00:37:59,684
Nikki!

444
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:04,553
Nikki! Breathe! Breathe! Breathe!

445
00:38:04,762 --> 00:38:06,957
Daddy is here! Everything
will be fine!

446
00:38:07,665 --> 00:38:08,723
Anjali!
- Yes!

447
00:38:08,833 --> 00:38:10,528
Papa!
- Relax!

448
00:38:11,769 --> 00:38:12,827
Relax!
- Papa!

449
00:38:14,639 --> 00:38:15,731
Mama!

450
00:38:16,674 --> 00:38:17,766
lts okay! lts okay!

451
00:38:19,777 --> 00:38:20,835
Papa!

452
00:38:20,945 --> 00:38:22,810
lt`s going to be okay!
lt`s going to be okay!

453
00:38:22,914 --> 00:38:24,506
lts okay, baby!
- Mummy is here, baby!

454
00:38:24,582 --> 00:38:25,640
Good girl!

455
00:38:25,817 --> 00:38:29,480
Papa!
- Everything will be fine!

456
00:38:30,788 --> 00:38:31,914
Papa!
- Everything will be fine!

457
00:38:37,762 --> 00:38:38,820
Papa!

458
00:38:40,732 --> 00:38:41,892
Mama!

459
00:38:50,708 --> 00:38:51,800
Let`s see your eyes!

460
00:38:53,511 --> 00:38:55,536
That`s good! She is alright now!

461
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:59,045
Hey! You are doing fine,
sweetheart! Take care!

462
00:38:59,117 --> 00:39:00,175
Love you, baby!

463
00:39:03,154 --> 00:39:06,783
Mr. Vishal! Nothing
to worry. lt happens.

464
00:39:07,892 --> 00:39:10,122
At times it happens due
to shortage of insulin.

465
00:39:10,828 --> 00:39:13,854
But now Nikki is fine!
Perfectly alright!

466
00:39:16,534 --> 00:39:19,526
Why are you sulking?
Cheer up now! Yeah!

467
00:39:19,804 --> 00:39:22,568
And Anjali is stronger than you.

468
00:39:24,575 --> 00:39:26,600
Doctor, how long will Nikki
have to endure all this?

469
00:39:26,844 --> 00:39:29,972
How long will she live with the
aid of the dialysis machine?

470
00:39:30,081 --> 00:39:32,641
We are trying our best, Vishal.

471
00:39:33,184 --> 00:39:35,084
As soon as we find
a suitable donor..

472
00:39:35,153 --> 00:39:36,552
..we will do the operation.

473
00:39:36,854 --> 00:39:40,551
But it could take some time to find
suitable kidney of Nikki`s age.

474
00:39:40,992 --> 00:39:44,587
Maybe one month.. one year
or maybe more than that.

475
00:39:45,096 --> 00:39:47,564
But from your end be fully prepared.

476
00:39:48,132 --> 00:39:50,566
And keep the money also ready.
- Okay, doctor.

477
00:39:50,668 --> 00:39:52,067
lt will cost around 10-12 lakhs.

478
00:39:52,236 --> 00:39:54,568
Doctor, money is not a problem.

479
00:39:54,672 --> 00:39:56,867
We have saved the money.

480
00:39:58,176 --> 00:39:59,905
You just arrange for the kidney.

481
00:40:00,144 --> 00:40:04,205
lt will be done. Everything will
be done. Just don`t worry. Okay.

482
00:40:04,649 --> 00:40:06,116
Cheer up now. Take care.

483
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,625
Today l will stay with Nikki!

484
00:40:24,869 --> 00:40:27,599
Wow! We all will play video game!

485
00:40:27,905 --> 00:40:29,634
Nikki, please! Papa
has to go to office!

486
00:40:34,212 --> 00:40:35,270
Bye!
- Bye!

487
00:40:35,813 --> 00:40:37,144
Bye!
- Bye, papa!

488
00:40:37,215 --> 00:40:38,273
Come on, Nikki!

489
00:40:44,655 --> 00:40:45,713
Hello!

490
00:40:55,066 --> 00:40:56,658
Hi!
- Hi!

491
00:41:06,644 --> 00:41:07,804
l am sorry for yesterday!

492
00:41:10,748 --> 00:41:13,649
Actually my husband suddenly
returned from his tour.

493
00:41:13,785 --> 00:41:15,685
So we made the plan of eating out.

494
00:41:16,687 --> 00:41:18,086
l had no idea that you too..

495
00:41:21,926 --> 00:41:24,656
You must have found
my behaviour strange.

496
00:41:25,897 --> 00:41:29,697
Yes. lt felt as if you
were ignoring me.

497
00:41:32,970 --> 00:41:36,064
Actually.. my husband`s
nature is very different.

498
00:41:37,308 --> 00:41:41,711
Even if l talk to somebody..
he gets very upset.

499
00:41:42,346 --> 00:41:44,780
You can say he is very
possessive about me.

500
00:41:46,117 --> 00:41:48,347
Then he should stay with
you all the time.

501
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:50,687
But you said that mostly..

502
00:41:50,755 --> 00:41:54,623
Yes! But when he is
with me.. he reacts..

503
00:41:54,692 --> 00:41:59,152
..violently for every
trivial matter.

504
00:42:04,035 --> 00:42:05,969
You.. you mean he hits you.

505
00:42:07,305 --> 00:42:12,333
No! No! Breaking things.

506
00:42:12,743 --> 00:42:16,702
You know.. he is very unpredictable.

507
00:42:17,248 --> 00:42:18,738
l am really scared of him.

508
00:42:18,850 --> 00:42:22,149
Don`t you feel choked
with such a person?

509
00:42:24,055 --> 00:42:29,891
Yes. l feel choked.

510
00:42:30,795 --> 00:42:33,662
But for my daughter`s sake,
to maintain this relation..

511
00:42:33,731 --> 00:42:34,857
..is my helplessness.

512
00:42:35,266 --> 00:42:37,791
Because she.. she needs both of us.

513
00:42:39,837 --> 00:42:43,739
Anyway. lt`s going on.

514
00:42:45,009 --> 00:42:48,775
And as it is not every woman
is lucky like your wife.

515
00:42:50,381 --> 00:42:52,747
You have a happy family. Touch wood.

516
00:42:55,086 --> 00:42:57,816
Not every laughing man is happy.

517
00:42:58,923 --> 00:43:03,758
There is a saying.. not every
glittering thing is gold.

518
00:43:05,363 --> 00:43:06,421
You are right.

519
00:43:59,951 --> 00:44:03,819
Diabetes! Nikki has diabetes!

520
00:44:04,355 --> 00:44:07,324
Juvenile diabetes. lt`s
an inborn ailment.

521
00:44:08,993 --> 00:44:10,119
lt`s very serious.

522
00:44:12,830 --> 00:44:15,355
We have kept a dialysis machine
at home for safety sake.

523
00:44:15,433 --> 00:44:18,163
So that she doesn`t have to go
to hospital again and again.

524
00:44:20,504 --> 00:44:22,836
You didn`t try for
kidney transplant?

525

Doctor is trying his best.

526
00:44:27,111 --> 00:44:29,841
When we will find a donor,
transplant will be done.

527
00:44:35,252 --> 00:44:36,947
The operation must
be very expensive.

528
00:44:38,856 --> 00:44:40,153
Yeah. We are saving for that.

529
00:44:42,860 --> 00:44:43,952
Nikki is our life.

530
00:44:45,896 --> 00:44:50,128
And her life.. is connected to the
beep-beep of the dialysis machine.

531
00:44:57,875 --> 00:45:00,935
Don`t worry. Everything
will be alright.

532
00:45:58,536 --> 00:46:00,595

Vishal, last night..

01:04:02,051 --> 01:04:05,248
Oh my God! What.. what happened?

01:04:05,355 --> 01:04:10,019
All this.. how? Blood!

Anjali, l fell asleep in
the train. 2 men came.

And.. they snatched my wallet!

689

Sit! Sit! l will get
the first aid kit!

690
01:04:31,047 --> 01:04:34,039
This city too.. is no longer safe.

Mugging.. robbery.. rape!

You too! Must have

You should have quietly
given your wallet!

Why were you acting like a hero!

695
01:04:45,595 --> 01:04:48,325

There wasn`t much money
in the wallet.

697
01:04:50,099 --> 01:04:51,396
And l have cancelled
all the credit cards.

698

Why? What happened?

704

Two ruffians snatched his wallet.
He is badly hurt too.

705
01:05:44,554 --> 01:05:47,114
Oh my God! He didn`t tell me!

706
01:05:47,257 --> 01:05:48,315
Anyway!

01:05:48,391 --> 01:05:50,120
Anjali, hang up! l got it!

708
01:05:52,128 --> 01:05:56,462
Hi, buddy! So you lied
to sister-in-law!

709
01:05:58,434 --> 01:05:59,526
You!

710
01:06:00,470 --> 01:06:03,337
By the way.. sister-in-law`s
voice is very sexy!

711
01:06:03,473 --> 01:06:05,134
Meaning she too..

712
01:06:05,275 --> 01:06:08,608
You scoundrel! How dare
you call at my home!

713
01:06:08,745 --> 01:06:12,237
l wouldn`t have done it! lf you
hadn`t blocked the credit cards!

714
01:06:14,450 --> 01:06:17,681
l need some money. 50,000!

715
01:06:19,689 --> 01:06:21,281
You are trying to blackmail me?

716
01:06:21,457 --> 01:06:23,516
Right now l am asking for a loan.

717
01:06:23,626 --> 01:06:28,529
l will think about blackmail!
lf you forced me!

718
01:06:29,332 --> 01:06:31,163
Fine! You will get the money!

719
01:06:32,702 --> 01:06:35,227
And don`t call again!
Do you understand?

720
01:06:35,438 --> 01:06:36,598
l will decide that!

721
01:07:39,235 --> 01:07:40,327
How are you Vishal?

722
01:07:43,573 --> 01:07:45,803
Fine, you.

723
01:07:49,545 --> 01:07:51,570
l am trying to be fine.

724
01:07:53,783 --> 01:08:01,315
Vishal, after that night l may
never be able to sleep again.

725
01:08:03,893 --> 01:08:09,263
Roma, l know that.. how difficult
it can be for a woman.

726
01:08:12,835 --> 01:08:18,205
But with time..
- There are some wounds..

727
01:08:18,274 --> 01:08:24,304
..that heal with time, but
they leave a mark for life.

728
01:08:28,484 --> 01:08:34,218
Anyway, we should try
to forget that night..

729
01:08:34,290 --> 01:08:37,350
..and each other too.

730
01:08:38,828 --> 01:08:41,729
Roma l think we should lodge
a complaint with the police.

731
01:08:41,864 --> 01:08:43,229
Just now you said that`s its
very difficult for a woman..

732
01:08:43,299 --> 01:08:45,893
..to come out of this trauma.

733
01:08:46,335 --> 01:08:48,769
And now you are talking
about going to the police.

734
01:08:51,841 --> 01:08:54,935
We will make a scene of ourselves
by going to the police.

735
01:08:58,781 --> 01:08:59,873
What will we say Vishal?

736
01:09:00,616 --> 01:09:01,844
Why did we go?

737
01:09:02,652 --> 01:09:04,347
Why did we go in that hotel Vishal?

738
01:09:04,620 --> 01:09:06,451
What had we gone to do there?

739
01:09:06,756 --> 01:09:07,848
Tell me Vishal.

740
01:09:08,624 --> 01:09:10,387
But we did not commit that sin.

741
01:09:10,593 --> 01:09:12,527
We maintained the
distance between us.

742
01:09:12,662 --> 01:09:15,324
Vishal, we had crossed the limits.

743
01:09:16,766 --> 01:09:19,394
Nothing happened between us,
only we know that.

744
01:09:20,336 --> 01:09:22,736
Who will believe us.

745
01:09:25,341 --> 01:09:27,366
l don`t know about your wife.

746
01:09:29,479 --> 01:09:35,349
But my husband, what if
he finds out about this?

747
01:09:37,787 --> 01:09:43,623
Vishal l don`t want to
lose my child, please.

748
01:09:45,828 --> 01:09:47,853
l don`t want to lose my child.

749
01:09:49,532 --> 01:09:50,897
That means other
then giving him money..

750
01:09:53,369 --> 01:09:58,397
Money.
- Yes, he had called this morning.

751
01:09:58,674 --> 01:10:00,574
And he has demanded for 50, 000.

752
01:10:02,011 --> 01:10:03,501
He said if he doesn`t
get the money, then..

753
01:10:06,983 --> 01:10:09,008
He, oh my God.

754
01:10:10,486 --> 01:10:11,680
lt means, he..

755
01:10:14,524 --> 01:10:17,789
Okay, l will arrange for some money.

756
01:10:18,928 --> 01:10:20,486
l will arrange for the money.

757
01:10:20,997 --> 01:10:22,862
l will make sure that he doesn`t..

758
01:10:25,701 --> 01:10:26,827
Take care of yourself.

759
01:10:32,408 --> 01:10:33,500
l will leave.

760
01:10:54,830 --> 01:10:57,355
`Mr. Vishal Dixit, today evening..

761
01:10:57,433 --> 01:11:00,527
..on the Old Mill road,
my man will meet you.`

762
01:11:01,070 --> 01:11:03,937
`And yes, don`t forget
to bring the money.`

763
01:11:21,757 --> 01:11:24,658
This is your 50, 000
bucks Mr. Vishal.

764
01:11:33,469 --> 01:11:35,460
Sorry.
- What sorry.

765
01:11:37,907 --> 01:11:41,001
Vishal Dixit.
- Yes.

766
01:11:41,110 --> 01:11:43,408
The mistake of swindling
others wife..

767
01:11:43,479 --> 01:11:45,538
..and that too in Tony-Bhai`s area.

768
01:11:45,748 --> 01:11:46,840
You are mad.

769
01:11:48,017 --> 01:11:49,484
What are you looking at, come on.

770
01:11:59,495 --> 01:12:00,587
You don`t have anything
on you, do you?

771
01:12:00,796 --> 01:12:02,525
Take the money, and leave me.

772
01:12:03,099 --> 01:12:05,624
l take the money, are you mad?

773
01:12:07,036 --> 01:12:08,094
Give the money to Tony, come on.

774
01:12:09,505 --> 01:12:10,563
Go up.

775
01:12:14,076 --> 01:12:18,513
Tony, your new prey Vishal has come.

776
01:12:31,060 --> 01:12:37,989
Hey buddy, l knew you will
surely solve my money problem.

777
01:12:40,803 --> 01:12:44,899
Sit, sit come on sit.

778
01:12:45,941 --> 01:12:46,999
How is your new girlfriend?

779
01:12:48,544 --> 01:12:52,537
Sorry, that day l was a bit too rude
with her. lt was your mistake.

780
01:12:52,848 --> 01:12:54,577
You provoked me.

781
01:12:54,984 --> 01:12:57,612
And l had a lot.

782
01:12:57,820 --> 01:13:01,483
Look, if you think..
- You should have thought..

783
01:13:01,557 --> 01:13:03,650
..before cheating on your wife.

784
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:09,156
What is the guarantee that.. - What
you want, that`s not important.

785
01:13:09,899 --> 01:13:12,060
What l want, that`s important.

786
01:13:12,568 --> 01:13:13,660
Give me the money.

787
01:13:14,103 --> 01:13:17,561
No, first assure me that
you won`t call me again.

788
01:13:24,180 --> 01:13:28,617
l bond relations l don`t
break it, that`s my law.

789
01:13:28,718 --> 01:13:29,776
Did you understand?

790
01:13:31,887 --> 01:13:33,013
Come on, get out.

791
01:13:53,876 --> 01:13:57,141
l was fed up of life, l was bored.

792
01:13:57,246 --> 01:13:58,907
l couldn`t eat hard wafers.

793
01:13:59,048 --> 01:14:02,950
Then l found out about these
soft and smooth wafers.

794
01:14:03,886 --> 01:14:04,978
What is this?

795
01:14:06,122 --> 01:14:07,180
What`s happening?

796
01:14:07,957 --> 01:14:10,619
Has Sameer made an ad about
the wafers or the bed?

797
01:14:11,694 --> 01:14:14,561
Not only will he shut down
this wafer company..

798
01:14:14,630 --> 01:14:17,758
..but he will bring
us on the road too.

799
01:14:18,901 --> 01:14:20,664
And that too on a soft
and smooth road.

800
01:14:22,938 --> 01:14:26,635
Sudheer, l am trapped
in a grave problem.

801
01:14:26,909 --> 01:14:29,639
We all are entrapped
in a grave problem.

802
01:14:30,746 --> 01:14:32,111
This problem is not work related.

803
01:14:34,650 --> 01:14:35,947
l have committed a big mistake.

804
01:14:41,924 --> 01:14:44,085
l have cheated on Anjali.
- What?

805
01:14:46,729 --> 01:14:50,756
Some days ago, on the train..
- Did Anjali find out about it?

806
01:14:51,667 --> 01:14:53,794
No.
- Then what`s the problem?

807
01:14:54,970 --> 01:14:56,028
Enjoy yourself.

808
01:14:56,105 --> 01:14:57,163
lt happens.

809
01:14:58,007 --> 01:14:59,599
When men are bored of
the routine things..

810
01:14:59,675 --> 01:15:02,200
..then they do require a change.

811
01:15:02,978 --> 01:15:04,036
Even l do sometimes.

812
01:15:06,015 --> 01:15:09,678
But that man..
- Man!

813
01:15:12,688 --> 01:15:14,781
So you are a sailor of that boat.

814
01:15:16,892 --> 01:15:19,827
Anyway, your choice
and your thoughts.

815
01:15:21,063 --> 01:15:23,623
Look Vishal, when you get
time from all this..

816
01:15:23,699 --> 01:15:25,860
..then concentrate
a bit on work too.

817
01:15:27,803 --> 01:15:31,705
lf you make this wafer eatable,
then it will better for all of us.

818
01:15:32,842 --> 01:15:33,900
Here.

819
01:15:34,710 --> 01:15:35,836
You are disgusting.

820
01:15:51,026 --> 01:15:54,826
This is your new sim card,
with two years warranty.

821
01:15:55,364 --> 01:15:58,925
Good choice, l hope you enjoy
your new mobile connection.

822
01:15:59,001 --> 01:16:00,059
Thank you.

823
01:16:15,217 --> 01:16:16,275
Thank you.

824
01:16:17,753 --> 01:16:19,846
Your new phone is activated.
-Thank you.

825
01:16:19,922 --> 01:16:21,014
Thank you sir.

826
01:16:22,758 --> 01:16:24,055
Vishal, what is all this?

827
01:16:24,793 --> 01:16:26,693
First you changed
your mobile number..

828
01:16:26,762 --> 01:16:29,162
..and now you have changed
the residential number too.

829
01:16:29,298 --> 01:16:31,289
Nothing, l am just changing
the number according..

830
01:16:31,367 --> 01:16:32,800
..to the numerology.

831
01:16:33,068 --> 01:16:37,767
Numerology, now you give the
number to everyone, l won`t.

832
01:16:44,346 --> 01:16:46,712
Dear l will give you 10, 000
rupees, don`t take tension..

833
01:16:46,782 --> 01:16:49,774
..come on, please bet it.

834
01:16:49,919 --> 01:16:52,854
Come on, bet 20,000. Bet it.

835
01:16:53,088 --> 01:16:55,852
Come on, bet 20, 000.
We will win it.

836
01:16:55,991 --> 01:16:57,788
lt is Bangladesh.

837
01:16:59,061 --> 01:17:02,189
l will come to the party..
good evening..

838
01:17:03,232 --> 01:17:06,292
Good morning. Tata, bye-bye.

839
01:17:07,102 --> 01:17:08,194
Not you.

840
01:17:08,270 --> 01:17:10,363
What? Bangladesh won.

841
01:17:22,351 --> 01:17:25,411
Hello.
- Hi buddy, how are you?

842
01:17:27,990 --> 01:17:29,116
How did you get the new number?

843
01:17:29,258 --> 01:17:31,886
You can even find God
if you look for him.

844
01:17:32,161 --> 01:17:35,824
l want one lakh, right now. - What?

845
01:17:36,465 --> 01:17:40,765
What happened, is the figure okay
according to the numerology..

846
01:17:40,836 --> 01:17:42,895
..or should l change it?

847
01:17:43,405 --> 01:17:44,838
Where are you speaking from?

848
01:17:45,107 --> 01:17:49,874
Strange Vishal, don`t you recognize
your residential number?

849
01:17:50,813 --> 01:17:52,280
You scoundrel!

850
01:18:07,062 --> 01:18:11,863
5! 1 , 2, 3, 4, 5 l won, l won.

851
01:18:12,167 --> 01:18:14,897
l won, l won you lost.

852
01:18:14,970 --> 01:18:16,938
Okay, l lost you won.

853
01:18:18,173 --> 01:18:19,970
Uncle you are cheating right.

854
01:18:23,145 --> 01:18:26,876
Dear, cheating.. hi buddy.

855
01:18:28,417 --> 01:18:31,875
Papa, look uncle has brought
so many toys for me.

856
01:18:31,987 --> 01:18:34,922
Dear, your dad has given
the money for these toys.

857
01:18:36,291 --> 01:18:37,417
Nikki, go to your room.

858
01:18:37,526 --> 01:18:39,221
Papa, l want to play.

859
01:18:39,294 --> 01:18:40,352
l said go inside!

860
01:18:42,164 --> 01:18:43,995
Bye sweetie, we will
play tomorrow okay.

861
01:18:44,099 --> 01:18:45,896
Bye.
- Bye.

862
01:18:47,336 --> 01:18:49,304
Vishal, you are back.

863
01:18:49,438 --> 01:18:50,837
l was about to call
you and inform you..

864
01:18:50,906 --> 01:18:53,431
.but he said that he wants
to surprise you.

865
01:18:54,209 --> 01:18:57,076
And looking at you it seems like
you are pretty surprised.

866
01:18:58,347 --> 01:19:00,838
This happens very time
sister-in-law. - Really.

867
01:19:00,916 --> 01:19:03,009
Whenever he sees me, he is shocked.

868
01:19:03,419 --> 01:19:06,911
And even l like to shock me.

869
01:19:09,925 --> 01:19:13,258
So Vishu, l found you out after all.

870
01:19:15,364 --> 01:19:17,855
But this is wrong, you didn`t
tell sister-in-law..

871
01:19:17,933 --> 01:19:19,264
..anything about me.

872
01:19:19,401 --> 01:19:21,926
He doesn`t tell me anything
about his friends.

873
01:19:22,471 --> 01:19:26,965
Did you tell sister-in-law
about Roma Kapoor?

874
01:19:29,244 --> 01:19:30,370
Roma Kapoor?

875
01:19:33,549 --> 01:19:35,881
Sister-in-law, it is the time
when we were in college.

876
01:19:35,951 --> 01:19:39,182
We both fell for a girl
name Roma Kapoor.

877
01:19:39,288 --> 01:19:42,018
But l won, and he
just kept watching.

878
01:19:42,157 --> 01:19:44,057
That`s why he is angry with me.

879
01:19:44,259 --> 01:19:45,886
But looking at your sister-in-law..

880
01:19:45,961 --> 01:19:48,953
..l feel that his
anger is worthless.

881
01:19:49,298 --> 01:19:52,324
She is nothing compared to you.

882
01:19:53,535 --> 01:19:56,231
You are so much better
looking then her.

883
01:19:57,606 --> 01:19:59,972
Thanks for the compliment.
- Anytime.

884
01:20:00,042 --> 01:20:02,033
You both chat, l will bring coffee.

885
01:20:06,982 --> 01:20:09,212
You scoundrel, you had the courage
to come to my house.

886
01:20:10,018 --> 01:20:12,509
How rude?

887
01:20:15,524 --> 01:20:18,584
You have still not seen my courage.

888
01:20:19,428 --> 01:20:22,989
l will kill you right on the spot.

889
01:20:24,299 --> 01:20:25,391
What did you think?

890
01:20:25,534 --> 01:20:29,026
By changing your phone number,
you fate will change.

891
01:20:30,072 --> 01:20:32,302
This time, l found me
in the drawing room.

892
01:20:32,441 --> 01:20:33,931
The next time l will find
me in the bedroom..

893
01:20:34,009 --> 01:20:36,034
..along with your wife, understand.

894
01:20:36,445 --> 01:20:40,176
l want one lakh, how much..

895
01:20:41,316 --> 01:20:43,011
Vishal, do you know
what happened today?

896
01:20:44,286 --> 01:20:46,584
Suddenly the gas pipe
started leaking.

897
01:20:47,456 --> 01:20:48,946
lt was a good thing that
your friend was here..

898
01:20:49,024 --> 01:20:51,151
..otherwise who know what
might have happened.

899
01:20:54,463 --> 01:20:56,055
Nice photograph sister-in-law.

900
01:20:57,199 --> 01:20:59,030
At least say thank you.

901
01:20:59,301 --> 01:21:02,099
You have such a nice family,
take care of them.

902
01:21:05,207 --> 01:21:06,435
Give me.

903
01:21:07,042 --> 01:21:08,304
Okay sister-in-law, l will leave.

904
01:21:09,111 --> 01:21:11,443
You are leaving, have dinner.

905
01:21:11,580 --> 01:21:12,979
Sister-in-law, if l
will have dinner..

906
01:21:13,048 --> 01:21:15,608
..then he won`t eat.

907
01:21:16,485 --> 01:21:17,975
And anyway, l have seen your house..

908
01:21:18,053 --> 01:21:19,577
..l will keep coming.

909
01:21:20,322 --> 01:21:23,314
Give sweetie a big kiss on
my behalf. - Of course.

910
01:21:23,392 --> 01:21:25,189
Bye sister-in-law.
- Bye-bye.

911
01:21:26,061 --> 01:21:27,153
Bye Vishu.

912
01:21:30,232 --> 01:21:31,460
What a nice guy.

913
01:21:40,609 --> 01:21:43,544
Vishal, l am not just your lawyer
l am your friend too.

914
01:21:43,712 --> 01:21:45,612
You should have told
me all this before.

915
01:21:45,747 --> 01:21:47,146
You are telling this to me, now?

916
01:21:48,250 --> 01:21:50,081
l thought l can handle it.

917
01:21:50,352 --> 01:21:52,013
He is a criminal, and not a client..

918
01:21:52,087 --> 01:21:54,248
..you should have lodged a
complaint with the police.

919
01:21:54,389 --> 01:21:56,289
No, l cannot do it.

920
01:21:56,425 --> 01:21:58,086
Then even l cannot do anything.

921
01:21:58,360 --> 01:22:00,191
He has come till my home.

922
01:22:00,395 --> 01:22:02,022
l know that he has come
till your house..

923
01:22:02,097 --> 01:22:04,031
..but has he done anything
in your house..

924
01:22:04,099 --> 01:22:05,157
..did he hurt your children?

925
01:22:05,234 --> 01:22:07,225
Did he misbehave with your wife?

926
01:22:07,302 --> 01:22:09,429
On what basis shall l file
a case against him?

927
01:22:09,538 --> 01:22:12,473
Okay how about this, he
is black mailing me.

928
01:22:12,574 --> 01:22:15,042
The reason for which he
is black mailing you..

929
01:22:15,110 --> 01:22:17,169
.. you don`t want to tell
that to the police.

930
01:22:17,312 --> 01:22:21,112
Then what evidence shall
l show the police.

931
01:22:21,383 --> 01:22:23,112
lsn`t there any other way?

932
01:22:23,252 --> 01:22:24,549
There is only one way.

933
01:22:25,220 --> 01:22:27,051
You and that girl, lodge a
complaint with the police..

934
01:22:27,122 --> 01:22:29,682
..and then go to the court
and tell everything.

935
01:22:29,758 --> 01:22:31,123
Only then can l do anything.

936
01:22:31,260 --> 01:22:34,058
No, that girl can neither
go to the police..

937
01:22:34,129 --> 01:22:36,154
..nor can she testify in the
court, its not possible.

938
01:22:36,265 --> 01:22:40,065
lf that`s so, then even
l can`t help you..

939
01:22:40,135 --> 01:22:42,160
..nor can the law of this country.

940
01:22:42,271 --> 01:22:44,501
l am really sorry, please,
l am sorry.

941
01:22:57,586 --> 01:22:58,678
lt is all my mistake.

942
01:23:00,489 --> 01:23:03,151
lf l hadn`t encouraged you.

943
01:23:04,159 --> 01:23:06,354
lf l had stopped you
from the beginning.

944
01:23:08,463 --> 01:23:11,159
There is no point in thinking
about what has happened.

945
01:23:11,500 --> 01:23:13,092
Now we have to think that..

946
01:23:13,168 --> 01:23:15,261
..how can we get out of this mess.

947
01:23:19,608 --> 01:23:21,508
There must be some way Vishal.

948
01:23:28,650 --> 01:23:30,709
l got it.
- What?

949
01:23:32,621 --> 01:23:35,181
That night we were in the hotel,
what is the evidence?

950
01:23:37,659 --> 01:23:40,389
The form that we had filled,
that we have filled.

951
01:23:41,596 --> 01:23:43,757
He is black mailing
us on that basis.

952
01:23:45,500 --> 01:23:47,525
lf we can get rid of
that form somehow.

953
01:23:47,602 --> 01:23:49,399
Even l will come along with you.

954
01:23:50,672 --> 01:23:52,435
We both have done this mistake.

955
01:23:52,541 --> 01:23:54,668
We both will solve this problem.

956
01:23:59,514 --> 01:24:00,606
You stay here.

957
01:24:06,521 --> 01:24:08,352
Excuse me.
- Yes.

958
01:24:09,624 --> 01:24:11,216
l want to check into one
of your rooms please.

959
01:24:12,561 --> 01:24:14,859
500 bucks.
- Okay.

960
01:24:17,532 --> 01:24:18,658
Cash or credit card.

961
01:24:20,302 --> 01:24:21,496
Credit.

962
01:24:30,512 --> 01:24:31,570
l am sorry.
- Oh God.

963
01:24:31,646 --> 01:24:33,273
l am sorry.
- You spoiled my coat.

964
01:24:33,382 --> 01:24:34,679
l am sorry.
- Okay, okay.

965
01:24:35,517 --> 01:24:36,575
l will wash up and come.

966
01:24:45,861 --> 01:24:46,919
Come on, come on.

967
01:24:47,429 --> 01:24:48,555
Come on, come on.

968
01:24:48,630 --> 01:24:49,688
What are you doing here?

969
01:24:49,765 --> 01:24:52,359
Who is there at the front there?
Come on.

970
01:24:52,534 --> 01:24:54,263
Come on get back to work.

971
01:25:02,744 --> 01:25:05,304
l got it.
- Oh great.

972
01:25:16,324 --> 01:25:17,416
First, let`s go from here.

973
01:25:18,593 --> 01:25:19,753
Come on, go.

974
01:27:01,959 --> 01:27:04,450
Yeah, no l have kind of..
- Good morning everybody.

975
01:27:04,529 --> 01:27:06,622
Good morning sir.
- Shall we begin?

976
01:27:06,697 --> 01:27:08,426
Good morning sir.
- Alright.

977
01:27:11,769 --> 01:27:12,895
So, shall we begin?

978
01:27:14,005 --> 01:27:15,370
Since your company has decided..

979
01:27:15,440 --> 01:27:17,101
..to launch a herbal shampoo.

980
01:27:17,542 --> 01:27:20,375
Since then half of my team
has lost their hair..

981
01:27:20,445 --> 01:27:22,879
..thinking about innovative ideas.

982
01:27:22,947 --> 01:27:25,438
lf you don`t believe me,
you can see Raman here.

983
01:27:27,552 --> 01:27:28,610
Cheers to that.

984
01:27:29,620 --> 01:27:31,781
So we will begin with
the presentation now.

985
01:27:34,792 --> 01:27:37,386
So the first concept that
we have planned out..

986
01:27:37,462 --> 01:27:41,125
..it aims towards teenagers
between the age of 13 and 15.

987
01:27:43,067 --> 01:27:46,036
Because l feel that this product
aims towards that age group..

988
01:27:46,104 --> 01:27:48,538
..and that`s why this first
age group is kept in mind.

989
01:28:26,511 --> 01:28:31,972
Hello. - Hi buddy, how did
you like my presentation?

990
01:28:33,918 --> 01:28:35,613
Your clients must have
been really happy.

991
01:28:37,522 --> 01:28:39,581
You stole the entry
form from the hotel..

992
01:28:39,657 --> 01:28:41,955
..and l, your peace and sleep.

993
01:28:43,961 --> 01:28:46,452
Just think, the story
behinds close doors..

994
01:28:46,531 --> 01:28:50,126
..can have this impact.

995
01:28:51,536 --> 01:28:54,528
When the posters will
be put up in the city..

996
01:28:54,605 --> 01:28:56,903
..in front of her and your house..

997
01:28:56,974 --> 01:28:59,033
..then this movie will
be a super hit.

998
01:29:01,946 --> 01:29:03,470
Shall l release it, buddy.

999
01:29:06,984 --> 01:29:12,081
You charge money for doing
publicity, and l for stopping it.

1000
01:29:12,557 --> 01:29:16,653
And my price is 5 lakh.

1001
01:29:35,179 --> 01:29:36,510
So that`s the matter.

1002
01:29:38,082 --> 01:29:41,677
Don`t take tension, Charlie has
an experience of 30 years.

1003
01:29:41,752 --> 01:29:47,782
l gamble and if necessary
l can thrash someone too.

1004
01:29:49,860 --> 01:29:51,054
That`s why l was jailed.

1005
01:29:51,662 --> 01:29:53,527
lf you had told me earlier..

1006
01:29:53,598 --> 01:29:55,589
..then l would have taken
care of that blackmailer.

1007
01:29:55,666 --> 01:29:56,792
What is the name of
that blackmailer?

1008
01:29:57,602 --> 01:30:03,165
Tony.
- His name is just like his deeds.

1009
01:30:03,608 --> 01:30:04,802
How much has he asked for?

1010
01:30:07,011 --> 01:30:08,876
5 lakhs.
- 5 lakhs!

1011
01:30:09,947 --> 01:30:11,539
You should have kicked him 5 times.

1012
01:30:12,216 --> 01:30:13,945
No Charlie, he is very dangerous.

1013
01:30:14,018 --> 01:30:15,610
He has come till my house.

1014
01:30:19,056 --> 01:30:22,890
l am afraid that..
- Don`t be afraid, Charlie is there.

1015
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:24,757
l have an 30 years of experience.

1016
01:30:24,829 --> 01:30:27,730
l will take care of
Tony permanently.

1017
01:30:31,202 --> 01:30:33,227
lf you need any money..

1018
01:30:35,973 --> 01:30:38,635
l am a gambler, but not a scoundrel.

1019
01:30:40,244 --> 01:30:41,575
Tell me, when do you have to meet?

1020
01:30:41,646 --> 01:30:44,911
Tomorrow night, behind
Siam Si, Old Mill road.

1021
01:30:45,182 --> 01:30:47,582
Must be some roadside goon..

1022
01:30:47,652 --> 01:30:51,315
..who is trying to act
too smart with you.

1023
01:30:55,226 --> 01:30:56,921
But today l will teach him a lesson.

1024
01:30:57,662 --> 01:31:00,722
This scares the bravest.

1025
01:31:00,798 --> 01:31:02,663
You keep a gun.

1026
01:31:03,834 --> 01:31:06,598
Even though l must have left line..

1027
01:31:06,671 --> 01:31:09,731
..but l know the language
that they speak, very well.

1028
01:31:10,675 --> 01:31:14,270
They only understand the language
of bullets, here.

1029
01:31:27,625 --> 01:31:28,751
Now.

1030
01:31:32,797 --> 01:31:34,628
Now we will observe from here..

1031
01:31:34,699 --> 01:31:37,293
..whether he comes alone
or with his gang.

1032
01:31:39,236 --> 01:31:40,635
l don`t know about his gang..

1033
01:31:40,705 --> 01:31:41,763
..but there is one man
always with him.

1034
01:31:42,707 --> 01:31:45,801
Then he must know me.

1035
01:31:45,876 --> 01:31:50,836
And if that`s so, then we
will not have to meet Tony.

1036
01:31:50,915 --> 01:31:53,179
Then maybe he will
understand nicely.

1037
01:31:53,250 --> 01:31:55,980
Otherwise we have this bullet.

1038
01:32:02,960 --> 01:32:04,325
You had brought him
along to kill me!

1039
01:32:06,063 --> 01:32:08,793
You think a lot, you will repent it.

1040
01:32:14,739 --> 01:32:18,266
Charlie, Charlie, Charlie.

1041
01:32:44,201 --> 01:32:45,759
l want my money.

1042
01:32:45,836 --> 01:32:48,430
Give me my money.

1043
01:32:48,973 --> 01:32:50,099
Scoundrel.

1044
01:32:58,182 --> 01:32:59,274
Hey you handsome.

1045
01:33:02,219 --> 01:33:03,379
l am talking to you.

1046
01:33:06,791 --> 01:33:09,282
You want to have fun?
- No.

1047
01:33:11,128 --> 01:33:13,460
Your friend?
- No.

1048
01:33:17,868 --> 01:33:18,960
Cigarette.

1049
01:33:28,345 --> 01:33:29,403
Thank you.

1050
01:33:29,480 --> 01:33:30,742
Lighter.

1051
01:33:33,083 --> 01:33:34,345
Hey Kim, what`s up?

1052
01:33:34,418 --> 01:33:35,817
Trouble with these guys.

1053
01:33:35,886 --> 01:33:37,183
Nothing, just time waste.

1054
01:33:37,254 --> 01:33:38,482
Hey you, stop.

1055
01:33:41,025 --> 01:33:42,458
Time waste, no time waste.

1056
01:33:43,360 --> 01:33:44,418
Hey man, you have to
pay tax for this.

1057
01:33:45,930 --> 01:33:46,988
Yeah.

1058
01:33:53,971 --> 01:33:55,233
Loser. Come.

1059
01:33:55,306 --> 01:33:56,432
Come on baby.

1060
01:33:58,342 --> 01:33:59,400
Easy money.
- Yeah.

1061
01:34:03,447 --> 01:34:05,039
Thanks.
- Okay.

1062
01:36:02,967 --> 01:36:07,461
Excuse me, Vishal Dixit.
- Yeah.

1063
01:36:07,538 --> 01:36:10,200
Hi, A. A. Khan.

1064
01:36:11,475 --> 01:36:13,033
Short for Asif Ahmed Khan.

1065
01:36:13,110 --> 01:36:16,204
Special investigating officer,
Bangkok police.

1066
01:36:17,247 --> 01:36:18,544
How can l help you officer?

1067
01:36:20,050 --> 01:36:21,108
Maybe you don`t know..

1068
01:36:21,185 --> 01:36:22,982
..that last night Charlie
D` Souza has been murdered.

1069
01:36:25,189 --> 01:36:26,520
What?
- Yes.

1070
01:36:27,992 --> 01:36:30,927
His body has been recovered
from the boot of his car..

1071
01:36:30,995 --> 01:36:33,987
..from some lake.
- Oh my God.

1072
01:36:35,399 --> 01:36:37,060
He was shot dead.

1073
01:36:41,505 --> 01:36:46,636
So Mr. Vishal, Charlie was quite
close to you, isn`t it?

1074
01:36:51,081 --> 01:36:53,481
Yes, just like one colleague is
close to another colleague.

1075
01:36:56,353 --> 01:36:58,685
That means he wasn`t your friend.

1076
01:37:02,092 --> 01:37:03,150
He was my friend too.

1077
01:37:05,362 --> 01:37:08,092
He was your friend too, good.

1078
01:37:09,133 --> 01:37:11,397
That means you must know
something about him.

1079
01:37:12,369 --> 01:37:14,633
lf not much, then something.

1080
01:37:17,041 --> 01:37:19,100
l used to sign on
his payroll report.

1081
01:37:19,176 --> 01:37:22,634
lnteresting, you must have
some idea about him.

1082
01:37:23,714 --> 01:37:27,172
His fight with someone,
or else personal enmity.

1083
01:37:27,251 --> 01:37:30,243
No.. l have no idea
officer, no idea.

1084
01:37:32,056 --> 01:37:34,456
So Mr. Vishal, which
gun do you keep?

1085
01:37:40,064 --> 01:37:42,624
Officer l work in an ad agency.

1086
01:37:42,700 --> 01:37:45,669
l don`t need a gun, but a pen,
pencil and a laptop.

1087
01:37:45,736 --> 01:37:47,465
Oh, l see.

1088
01:37:49,339 --> 01:37:55,141
So Mr. Vishal, where were you
between 7 and 12 last night?

1089
01:37:55,212 --> 01:37:56,736
You are suspecting me?

1090
01:37:57,181 --> 01:38:00,150
Of course.. not.

1091
01:38:00,217 --> 01:38:04,347
Sorry, but l begin my investigation
like this.

1092
01:38:07,357 --> 01:38:08,517
l was in the office.

1093
01:38:08,592 --> 01:38:10,685
Anybody who can testify this?

1094
01:38:10,761 --> 01:38:14,527
No, l was alone everyone
else went home.

1095
01:38:16,633 --> 01:38:17,759
May l?

1096
01:38:26,443 --> 01:38:28,343
Hello.
- Hi buddy.

1097
01:38:29,613 --> 01:38:34,380
You. - l understood, you are
thinking of a new plan..

1098
01:38:34,451 --> 01:38:37,181
..but l have the plan.

1099
01:38:41,191 --> 01:38:42,317

1101
01:38:49,733 --> 01:38:51,394
Vishal, help me Vishal.

1102
01:38:51,468 --> 01:38:52,662
Roma.

1103
01:38:54,138 --> 01:38:58,074
l am sorry she is a bit
tied up at the moment.

1104
01:38:58,142 --> 01:39:00,406
Don`t you dare touch her,
do you understand.

1105
01:39:01,545 --> 01:39:02,705
What happened?

1106
01:39:04,348 --> 01:39:08,341
Yesterday you brought along
someone to kill me.

1107
01:39:10,154 --> 01:39:12,520
Today l have found
a cover for myself.

1108
01:39:16,393 --> 01:39:21,456
A beautiful cover, we all love her.

1109
01:39:23,834 --> 01:39:26,234
Tony, look l am sorry.

1110
01:39:26,303 --> 01:39:28,498

ln the next three hours, all the
women that are in your life..

01:39:38,182 --> 01:39:43,449
..she your wife and your child

01:39:45,189 --> 01:39:47,350
One by one l will kill them all.

1114
01:39:49,860 --> 01:39:56,561
And the first person to leave
you will be your lover.

1115
01:39:56,633 --> 01:39:58,794
Please don`t do anything
like that, please.

1116
01:39:59,203 --> 01:40:03,264
The price to do nothing is 10 lakh.

1117
01:40:04,541 --> 01:40:06,133
lf in the next 30 minutes..

1118
01:40:06,210 --> 01:40:08,474
..you don`t reach your
lovers house then

1119
01:40:23,227 --> 01:40:26,390
Sorry, inspector l have
a meeting to go to.

1120
01:40:26,463 --> 01:40:28,158
lt was a client`s call.

1121
01:40:32,302 --> 01:40:33,428
lt`s urgent.

1122
01:40:48,785 --> 01:40:56,715
30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80,
90 one million.

1123
01:40:56,793 --> 01:41:00,320
Are you sure you want to carry
all this cash with you? - Yes.

1124
01:41:18,282 --> 01:41:19,374
Down!

1125
01:41:24,621 --> 01:41:25,713
Hi buddy.

1126
01:41:28,425 --> 01:41:29,551
lmpressed.

1127
01:41:32,896 --> 01:41:36,297
Look, l had promised that
l wont touch her..

1128
01:41:36,366 --> 01:41:39,392
..l didn`t even touch her, really.

1129
01:41:41,972 --> 01:41:44,964
l didn`t do anything to her, look.

1130
01:41:47,311 --> 01:41:48,403
Did you bring the money?

1131
01:41:49,713 --> 01:41:50,771
Don`t give him the money.

1132
01:41:50,847 --> 01:41:51,905
You scoundrel!

1133
01:41:55,919 --> 01:41:59,252
Now l hit her, she
was disturbing me.

1134
01:42:16,340 --> 01:42:17,773
Should l count it or trust you.

1135
01:42:21,278 --> 01:42:22,438
Okay, l won`t count it.

1136
01:42:24,848 --> 01:42:27,408
But l will have to kill you first!
- No!

1137
01:42:29,753 --> 01:42:32,347
l have given you the money,
now let us go!

1138
01:42:32,422 --> 01:42:34,356
After making me do one murder..

1139
01:42:34,424 --> 01:42:37,359
..anyway what will you
do by living on!

1140
01:42:37,427 --> 01:42:38,951
You don`t have money.

1141
01:42:39,363 --> 01:42:41,422
The child is about to die.

1142
01:42:41,498 --> 01:42:43,363
And l will take care of the wife.

1143
01:42:44,434 --> 01:42:45,924
Now you die.

1144
01:42:46,003 --> 01:42:47,903
But before killing you.

1145
01:42:47,971 --> 01:42:49,905
First l will kill this girl.

1146
01:42:49,973 --> 01:42:51,304
Don`t..
- Wait.

1147
01:43:03,387 --> 01:43:04,911
Love is a strange thing.

1148
01:43:12,662 --> 01:43:14,892
lt ruins and bankrupts a man.

1149
01:43:16,400 --> 01:43:18,334
But he doesn`t reform.

1150
01:43:19,503 --> 01:43:20,868
l spared her for you.

1151
01:43:21,405 --> 01:43:22,531
Enjoy.

1152
01:43:26,076 --> 01:43:30,410
And yes, next time when you
both are in the hotel..

1153
01:43:30,480 --> 01:43:33,074
Lock the doors.

1154
01:43:35,419 --> 01:43:36,579
Go, all yours.

1155
01:44:27,871 --> 01:44:28,963
Vishal.

1156
01:44:34,744 --> 01:44:36,143
Why did you stop him?

1157
01:44:38,648 --> 01:44:40,081
You should have let me die.

1158
01:44:50,427 --> 01:44:54,557
All your life savings, for me..

1159
01:44:58,902 --> 01:45:00,494
Why Vishal?

1160
01:45:04,508 --> 01:45:06,032
How am l related to you?

1161
01:45:09,779 --> 01:45:11,576
What is the relation between us.

1162
01:45:16,520 --> 01:45:17,612
Of humanity.

1163
01:45:25,929 --> 01:45:28,864
l am sorry Vishal, l am sorry.

1164
01:45:30,800 --> 01:45:34,634
l am very sorry, l am very sorry.

1165
01:46:02,566 --> 01:46:06,662
Hello, hello, hello Vishal.

1166
01:46:07,637 --> 01:46:08,763
Hello, hello.

1167
01:46:46,676 --> 01:46:49,611
l didn`t even have to search so
much for my girlfriend too.

1168
01:46:49,679 --> 01:46:52,147
Not in the office, not in the house.

1169
01:46:53,950 --> 01:46:55,941
And where did l find
you, in the bar.

1170
01:46:58,054 --> 01:47:00,284
Bro, whiskey on the rocks.
- Sure sir.

1171
01:47:05,095 --> 01:47:08,223
When l was tired of waiting
for you like a lover..

1172
01:47:10,233 --> 01:47:13,168
..so l sniffed you out
like a police officer.

1173
01:47:14,638 --> 01:47:15,764
What do you want?

1174
01:47:17,707 --> 01:47:20,904
Question? My questions trouble
you a lot, isn`t it?

1175
01:47:20,977 --> 01:47:25,641
The same question, where
were you that night?

1176
01:47:26,916 --> 01:47:30,044
Then my answer is the same,
in the office.

1177
01:47:38,862 --> 01:47:39,988
That was not fun.

1178
01:47:41,064 --> 01:47:42,588
Next time when we meet..

1179
01:47:42,666 --> 01:47:44,725
..either l will have to
change my questions..

1180
01:47:45,935 --> 01:47:47,061
..or you have to change
your answers.

1181
01:47:55,612 --> 01:47:59,048
And yes, whoever has
killed Charlie..

1182
01:48:02,252 --> 01:48:03,685
..l will not spare him.

1183
01:48:23,239 --> 01:48:24,297
l am sorry.

1184
01:48:25,108 --> 01:48:26,336
l am sorry.

1185
01:48:37,787 --> 01:48:38,913
l am really sorry.

1186
01:48:42,726 --> 01:48:43,852
Vishal, what happened?

1187
01:48:51,935 --> 01:48:53,197
Please forgive me Anjali.

1188
01:48:57,741 --> 01:48:58,901
l have made a very big mistake.

1189
01:49:05,148 --> 01:49:06,342
l have deceived you.

1190
01:49:13,256 --> 01:49:14,416
Her name is Roma.

1191
01:49:18,294 --> 01:49:19,761
Some days ago l had
met her in the train.

1192
01:50:04,073 --> 01:50:05,199
How dare you?

1193
01:50:06,009 --> 01:50:07,203
How dare you?

1194
01:50:08,812 --> 01:50:10,871
You gave away Nikki`s
treatment money!

1195
01:50:10,947 --> 01:50:12,346
Nikki`s treatment money!

1196
01:50:12,882 --> 01:50:15,214
And that too for a woman.

1197
01:50:18,755 --> 01:50:22,486
Now what will happen to my daughter?

1198
01:50:24,828 --> 01:50:26,295
You killed my daughter!

1199
01:50:27,831 --> 01:50:28,957
You killed her!

1200
01:50:31,901 --> 01:50:33,766
What kind of a father
are you Vishal?

1201
01:50:33,837 --> 01:50:35,361
What kind of a father are you?

1202
01:51:11,207 --> 01:51:15,143
Life always gave me sorrows.

1203
01:51:17,046 --> 01:51:22,143
lt always made me cry.

1204
01:51:22,218 --> 01:51:26,917
Life always gave me sorrows.

1205
01:51:28,892 --> 01:51:33,955
lt always made me cry.

1206
01:52:03,993 --> 01:52:09,329
My kin behaved like
strangers with me.

1207
01:52:09,399 --> 01:52:14,996
No one could understand
the conspiracy of time.

1208
01:52:15,071 --> 01:52:20,941
My kin behaved like
strangers with me.

1209
01:52:21,010 --> 01:52:26,607
No one could understand
the conspiracy of time.

1210
01:52:26,950 --> 01:52:33,480
l made some mistakes.

1211
01:52:36,225 --> 01:52:40,025
My paths were full of hardships.

1212
01:52:41,965 --> 01:52:45,958
Life always gave me sorrows.

1213
01:52:47,570 --> 01:52:53,065
lt always made me cry.

1214
01:52:53,142 --> 01:52:59,047
Life always gave me sorrows.

1215
01:53:26,009 --> 01:53:29,638
Life is a struggle.

1216
01:53:31,948 --> 01:53:35,543
lt never befriended me.

1217
01:53:37,487 --> 01:53:41,389
Life is a struggle.

1218
01:53:43,426 --> 01:53:47,192
lt never befriended me.

1219
01:53:49,298 --> 01:53:55,498
Whenever it met me, gave me tears.

1220
01:53:58,107 --> 01:54:02,043
Gave me very less chance to smile.

1221
01:54:04,047 --> 01:54:07,642
Gave me very less chance to smile.

1222
01:54:09,719 --> 01:54:15,055
Life always gave me sorrows.

1223
01:54:15,124 --> 01:54:21,552
lt always made me cry.

1224
01:54:45,188 --> 01:54:49,648
Life always gave me sorrows.

1225
01:55:13,116 --> 01:55:16,176
`My daughter lshita, she
is my sweet heart.`

1226
01:55:19,388 --> 01:55:23,119
This..
- Yes, 20 bucks.

1227
01:55:23,192 --> 01:55:24,716
No, l am talking about this child.

1228
01:55:24,794 --> 01:55:27,194
She is an lndian baby, she
is a very sweet girl.

1229
01:55:27,263 --> 01:55:32,166
She is a baby model we have put
up her photo in all the frames.

1230
01:55:32,235 --> 01:55:35,796
Do you want to buy the frame?
- No

1231
01:55:38,141 --> 01:55:39,199
Thank you, yes.

1232
01:55:39,275 --> 01:55:41,402
Ms. Roma Kapoor.
- There she is.

1233
01:55:45,515 --> 01:55:46,573
Not her, the other girl.

1234
01:55:46,649 --> 01:55:50,551
The one l was sitting
with the other day.

1235
01:55:51,687 --> 01:55:53,587
Oh, you mean Richa Malhotra.

1236
01:55:55,391 --> 01:56:00,226
Mrs. Kapoor`s temporary secretary,
she quit yesterday.

1237
01:56:02,165 --> 01:56:03,223
Something wrong.

1238
01:56:12,275 --> 01:56:13,401
Excuse me.

1239
01:56:14,243 --> 01:56:15,301
Yes sir.

1240
01:56:15,378 --> 01:56:17,539
l want to meet Mrs. Roma Kapoor.

1241
01:56:17,613 --> 01:56:19,103
Sorry this flat is Mr. Roberts,
he had given it to someone..

1242
01:56:19,182 --> 01:56:21,810
..on rent for a month.

1243
01:56:22,185 --> 01:56:24,119
Suddenly because of some emergency..

1244
01:56:24,187 --> 01:56:26,178
..they left the flat last night.

1245
01:56:26,255 --> 01:56:27,813
And they took all their
belongings with them.

1246
01:56:29,192 --> 01:56:31,126
They left this photo frame behind..

1247
01:56:31,194 --> 01:56:32,684
..she is a very sweet child.

1248
01:56:33,462 --> 01:56:34,656
Excuse me.

1249
01:56:54,717 --> 01:56:56,150
Hello. - Hello Vishal, doctor
Mathur speaking..

1250
01:56:56,219 --> 01:56:58,744
..there is a good news for you.

1251
01:56:58,821 --> 01:57:01,289
We have found a donor for Nikki.

1252
01:57:01,357 --> 01:57:04,724
Quickly come to the hospital and
complete all the formalities.

1253
01:57:05,228 --> 01:57:06,752
l will see you in the hospital.

1254
01:59:10,753 --> 01:59:12,414
Not from here, go from there!

1255
01:59:50,826 --> 01:59:51,884
`Stop the car please.`

1256
02:00:07,410 --> 02:00:08,843
Yes, don`t worry Anjali.

1257
02:00:08,911 --> 02:00:11,072
Nikki`s insulin level
is completely normal.

1258
02:00:12,782 --> 02:00:14,340
We can operate her, just relax.
- Hi doctor.

1259
02:00:15,418 --> 02:00:16,544
Hi Vishal.

1260
02:00:18,821 --> 02:00:20,015
Everything will be fine.

1261
02:00:20,089 --> 02:00:22,785
Thank you doctor.
- l will see you later.

1262
02:00:23,659 --> 02:00:24,751
Don`t worry.

1263
02:00:43,712 --> 02:00:45,373
Anjali, what l have done..

1264
02:00:45,448 --> 02:00:48,440
..after doing that l have lost the
right to ask for forgiveness.

1265
02:00:49,518 --> 02:00:52,385
Today l have found out, that what
l thought was my mistake..

1266
02:00:52,455 --> 02:00:55,583
..was actually
a conspiracy against me.

1267
02:00:56,926 --> 02:01:00,794
lt was a planning, l was..
l was being swindled.

1268
02:01:02,631 --> 02:01:04,121
But l will find them Anjali.

1269
02:01:04,867 --> 02:01:06,129
l will find them at any cost.

1270
02:01:08,871 --> 02:01:13,001
And if l am right,
then our child will win.

1271
02:01:19,748 --> 02:01:21,147
Anjali, please forgive me.

1272
02:01:24,687 --> 02:01:25,847
l love you Anjali.

1273
02:01:40,736 --> 02:01:42,101
Yes, how can l help you?

1274
02:01:43,706 --> 02:01:44,764
Can l have a room please?

1275
02:01:45,508 --> 02:01:46,634
Please fill the form.

1276
02:01:57,520 --> 02:01:58,612
Top floor.

1277
02:02:00,022 --> 02:02:01,683
Would you like to keep
anything in the locker?

1278
02:02:01,757 --> 02:02:03,782
Not really. - Thank you.

1279
02:02:37,493 --> 02:02:38,653
This way.

1280
02:04:09,585 --> 02:04:10,711
Who are you?

1281
02:04:12,254 --> 02:04:13,983
l am one of their victims.

1282
02:04:16,258 --> 02:04:17,657
What do you want, money?

1283
02:04:17,726 --> 02:04:18,920
Here, take the money. Take it.

1284
02:04:18,994 --> 02:04:21,986
She wants your money and not me..

1285
02:04:22,064 --> 02:04:24,191
..and that`s why she
has brought you here.

1286
02:04:26,335 --> 02:04:28,200
With complete planning
with her lover.

1287
02:04:29,938 --> 02:04:31,303
What name did you tell him?

1288
02:04:32,675 --> 02:04:36,202
Roma Kapoor, Richa Malhotra
what name did you say?

1289
02:04:37,946 --> 02:04:39,937
l don`t know this man,

1290
02:04:53,629 --> 02:04:54,789
She must have met
you in the train.

1291
02:04:54,863 --> 02:04:57,627
Then she must have showed
you her daughter`s photo.

1292
02:04:57,700 --> 02:04:58,792
Yes.

1293
02:04:59,702 --> 02:05:00,828
That`s not her daughter.

1294
02:05:02,938 --> 02:05:07,170
She entrapped you and brought
you to this hotel room.

1295
02:05:08,944 --> 02:05:12,277
And after that her lover was
supposed to come in and rape her.

1296
02:05:12,815 --> 02:05:15,045
Rape, but why?

1297
02:05:15,117 --> 02:05:17,984
So that you will blame yourself.

1298
02:05:19,188 --> 02:05:21,713
So that you feel guilty,
that you couldn`t protect her!

1299
02:05:24,660 --> 02:05:26,719
Then they would start
blackmailing you.

1300
02:05:28,731 --> 02:05:32,360
And then you would have given
your life`s earning to them.

1301
02:05:35,237 --> 02:05:37,728
l understood everything,
l understood everything.

1302
02:05:37,806 --> 02:05:39,296
Let me go.

1303
02:05:39,375 --> 02:05:42,242
Wait, there is security
guard outside.

1304
02:05:42,311 --> 02:05:43,835
He is along with him.

1305
02:05:43,912 --> 02:05:45,004
Even the hotel people
are along with them.

1306
02:05:45,080 --> 02:05:46,206
Don`t go out.

1307
02:05:46,281 --> 02:05:48,681
Where is my money, tell me.

1308
02:05:48,751 --> 02:05:49,843
Where is my money?

1309
02:05:54,957 --> 02:05:57,892
Very impressed buddy, very good.

1310
02:05:57,960 --> 02:05:59,291
Where is my money?

1311
02:06:00,162 --> 02:06:02,153
Money, what money?

1312
02:06:07,770 --> 02:06:08,896
Where is my money?

1313
02:07:05,928 --> 02:07:07,020
Where is my money?

1314
02:07:07,095 --> 02:07:08,824
Where is my money?
Where is my money?

1315
02:07:08,897 --> 02:07:10,194
Tell me, where is my money?

1316
02:07:10,265 --> 02:07:13,894
Where is my money, you scoundrel?

1317
02:07:13,969 --> 02:07:16,904
Where is my money?
Where is my money?

1318
02:07:16,972 --> 02:07:18,837
Tell me, where is my money?

1319
02:07:18,907 --> 02:07:20,772
Tell me, where is my money?

1320
02:07:20,843 --> 02:07:21,935
Tell me, where is my money?

1321
02:09:03,312 --> 02:09:06,008
Money, the money is down in the safe.

1322
02:09:25,968 --> 02:09:27,560
So you checked in last night, is it?

1323
02:09:27,970 --> 02:09:31,963
Yes, my name is Vishal Dixit
l work for GMM ad agency..

1324
02:09:32,040 --> 02:09:34,031
..and l had come here
because of some work

1325
02:09:34,109 --> 02:09:37,237
..and when the shots were
fired l was working..

1326
02:09:37,312 --> 02:09:39,906
..and when l saw the security
officer running..

1327
02:09:39,982 --> 02:09:42,416
..l closed the door of my room.

1328
02:09:42,484 --> 02:09:45,976
Very good, in such situations
people generally try to be a hero..

1329
02:09:46,054 --> 02:09:49,285
..and often get killed, then we
police have to face the problems.

1330
02:09:49,358 --> 02:09:51,986
Anyways you can leave, okay.
- Thank you.

1331
02:09:52,060 --> 02:09:53,118
lf we need anything else,
we will contact you.

1332
02:09:53,195 --> 02:09:54,253
Thank you.

1333
02:09:54,997 --> 02:09:56,123
Officer, write the report.

1334
02:09:56,198 --> 02:09:57,927
lt is a clear case of robbery.

1335
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:00,093
From the evidence and eye witness.

1336
02:10:00,168 --> 02:10:03,626
The thief came in to steal, the
security guard confronted him.

1337
02:10:03,705 --> 02:10:05,673
All the four were killed
in the cross fire.

1338
02:10:05,941 --> 02:10:08,375
l think we can close this case.
- Yes sir.

1339
02:10:09,011 --> 02:10:12,105
Are all the bags in the locker?
- No sir

1340
02:10:12,180 --> 02:10:13,272
l am not aware of this.

1341
02:10:14,016 --> 02:10:17,076
Can you check this?

1342
02:10:19,621 --> 02:10:22,021
Lee bag from room number 602.

02:10:23,125 --> 02:10:24,183

Okay, can l see your lD card please?

1346

Okay, you can take it.

1349
02:10:41,576 --> 02:10:44,044
The other bag is found

1350
02:10:47,516 --> 02:10:50,110
How do you find it?
- You don`t worry about it.

1351
02:11:47,042 --> 02:11:48,202
Daddy.

1352
02:11:53,115 --> 02:11:54,241
Vishal.

1353
02:12:16,204 --> 02:12:20,368
Life is a train.

1354
02:12:20,442 --> 02:12:25,141
On the track of time.

1355
02:12:25,213 --> 02:12:34,588
We are the passengers in
the coach of moments.

1356
02:12:35,757 --> 02:12:39,818
We are going on,
from here to there.

1357
02:12:40,162 --> 02:12:44,565
Every moment, everyday
from dawn to dusk.
