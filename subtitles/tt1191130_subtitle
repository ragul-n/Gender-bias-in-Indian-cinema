Can't quench my thirst of ages.

20

Everyone's mourning

Happiness is being snuffed out.

24
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:28,371
Take a Iook.

Yes, sir.

Wife? -My wife?

38
00:05:03,436 --> 00:05:04,460

What did you think?
I won't find you? -Be quiet.

I know everything.
-What do you know?

44
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:18,416
You're having an affair

Is it him?
-Go get yourseIf treated first.

Why is the bag stiII here?
-Why didn't you sent it?

48
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,351
How much did you earn? -Who gave
you this sari? -You're a miser.

49
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:30,293
Let me take a Iook as to who

I know it's. .

53
00:05:35,468 --> 00:05:37,459
Why are you creating a scene
in front of my boss?

54
00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:23,243
FoIIow me.

55
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:23,274
Don't move.

56
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:25,436
Give the chiId to me. -Leave him.

57
00:07:26,312 --> 00:07:27,370
PIease Ieave him.

Drop the gun.

00:07:49,535 --> 00:07:51,332
Drop the gun! Drop the gun!

61
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:52,337
Drop the gun!

62
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:57,342
Drop it now.

63

Move.

64
00:08:47,393 --> 00:08:49,361
You okay? -Yes, I'm fine.

65
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:53,364
What's wrong?
Why are we missing targets?

66
00:08:53,432 --> 00:08:55,297
We're burdened with too much work.

67
00:08:55,434 --> 00:08:57,334
We'II have to search
for him again.

68
00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:02,498
They've troubIed me a Iot.

69
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:05,306
Get in. -Let me go, sir.

70
00:09:05,344 --> 00:09:08,279
Sir, I haven't done anything.
-Get in!

71
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,474
Get in, get in.
-I haven't done anything.

72
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:13,350
It was a mistake, sir.
-Get down. Get down.

73
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:15,377
You made a mistake and you
haven't done anything.

74
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:18,416
Just a minute, Ieave him.
-Come here, come here. -No, sir.

75
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:19,480
Come here.

What is your name? -Sir, MiIind.

How Iong have you known Boris?
-What, sir?

00:09:25,464 --> 00:09:27,432
Do you know Boris or not?
-No, sir.

79
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,435
Speak the truth.
Come on, come on. -Say it, say it.

80
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:33,329
Sir, I'd do their odd jobs.

81
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,431
Odd jobs.
You'd deIiver their goods.

82
00:09:35,474 --> 00:09:37,374
Here's the money.
He's Iying to us.

83
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,310
No, sir. I needed money.

84
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:42,438
My mother has cataract
in her eyes.

85
00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:45,440
The doctor said,
If I don't it operated upon. .

86
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:47,478
. . my mother might Iose her sight.

87
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,249
Let me go, sir.

88
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:50,344
Hey, don't abuse him.

89
00:09:50,456 --> 00:09:51,514
Get him inside. -Sir.

90
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:53,347
Just a minute.

91
00:09:54,293 --> 00:09:55,282
Come here.

92
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,389
Do you study? -Yes, sir. I study.

93
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,527
Which grade are you in?
-I'm in tenth grade, sir.

94
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:07,438
Let him go. -Run away. -Return
the money to him.

95
00:10:07,506 --> 00:10:08,473
Here.

96
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:14,535
Sir.

97
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:21,377
Why did you Iet him go?

98
00:10:23,522 --> 00:10:25,353
This is his first mistake. .

99
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:27,325
. . and it happened because
of his heIpIessness.

100
00:10:28,427 --> 00:10:31,396
And everyone shouId
get one chance.

101
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:33,423
If we'd imprisoned him. .

102
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,297
. . he wouId've come out as
a hardened criminaI.

103
00:10:35,334 --> 00:10:36,392
He won't reform now either.

104
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:39,302
If he doesn't,
then you're there to reform him.

105
00:10:39,505 --> 00:10:42,406
Sir, the journaIists are here?
-He'II meet them.

106
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:44,434
You go. That's your job.

107
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,308
I shouId go. -You go.

108
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:47,403
It's your job. -Come on.

109
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,504
Sir. Sir.

110
00:10:50,449 --> 00:10:52,508
You didn't do the right thing
by Ietting that boy go.

111
00:10:52,551 --> 00:10:55,349
He has committed a crime. -We
shouId register case against him.

112
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:58,357
It's a triviaI issue. -It might
be for you, but not for me.

113
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:00,392
You aIways do that.

114
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:03,259
That boy said a few
emotionaI Iines. .

115
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,353
. . and you pardoned him.

116
00:11:05,297 --> 00:11:07,265
Go commit a bigger crime,
then we'II apprehend you.

117
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,392
AIong with Iaw,
we shouId understand humans too.

118
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:11,360
He's a smaII boy.

119
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:13,405
He committed this crime due
to his heIpIessness.

120
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:16,306
HeIpIessness. -Can you guarantee
that he won't commit. .

121
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:18,407
Can you guarantee that he
won't become a criminaI. .

122
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:20,275
. . after he's reIeased from jaiI?

123
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:24,347
I thought he's a boy,
we shouId give him one chance.

124
00:11:24,383 --> 00:11:26,351
And that's what I did. -Have you
taken up the job of passing. .

125
00:11:26,385 --> 00:11:29,320
. . verdicts in the poIice station?
-Let peopIe do their job.

126
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,255
Our duty is to apprehend
the criminaIs. .

127
00:11:31,323 --> 00:11:32,381
. . and bring them to the court.

128
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:34,484
The judge wiII decide whether it
was his heIpIessness or not.

129
00:11:35,294 --> 00:11:36,386
Whether he's a criminaI or not.

130
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:38,387
Sir is in a bad mood.

131
00:11:38,464 --> 00:11:39,453
He's angry.

132
00:13:16,428 --> 00:13:18,293
We've reached home quite Iate.

133
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:20,321
Our wives must be asIeep,
so, we'II just sIip in.

134
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:22,459
Sir, your wife must be asIeep.

135
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:24,529
My wife must be waiting for me.

136
00:13:25,337 --> 00:13:26,395
Why? Your wife doesn't sIeep?

137
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:28,497
TeII me what I shouId do?

138
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:30,275
What shouId I do?

139
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:33,410
What I shouId do? -When you're
so afraid of your wives. .

140
00:13:33,445 --> 00:13:34,503
. . why do you get married?

141
00:13:35,347 --> 00:13:37,406
You'II know that once you're
in that situation.

142
00:13:37,516 --> 00:13:39,347
Your turn wiII come soon, Vinay.

143
00:13:39,518 --> 00:13:43,454
Isn't it, ShaIini? -Yes, sir.
I'm waiting for that day.

144
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:46,381
And he's not heeding
to my request.

145
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:48,517
I've given my appIication.

146
00:13:49,461 --> 00:13:51,486
But. . he doesn't take
up the matter.

147
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:53,423
Take a Iook, sir. -No, no.

148
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:55,458
Do you want my recommendation?

149
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,366
Give me the fiIe. -No, sir.

150
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:01,228
Bye.

151
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:03,308
Sir.

152
00:14:33,472 --> 00:14:34,496
What's this, Papa?

153
00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:36,399
Is this the time to come home?

154
00:14:36,475 --> 00:14:38,443
AII my friends waited

155
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:41,377
. . to go to the cIub.
-And you didn't come.

156
00:14:41,413 --> 00:14:43,506
That's not fair. -Son, I. .

. . towards your son or not?

161

Are you my father or am I yours?
-Papa.

162
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:56,418
Don't change the topic.

163
00:14:56,462 --> 00:14:57,451
Can we compromise?

164
00:14:57,496 --> 00:14:59,430
Can we do something that. . -No.

165
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:01,323

Go pIay with them!

392
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:57,403
Your innocent eyes carry a
thousand questions for Iife.

393
00:36:58,349 --> 00:37:03,309
I don't care about myseIf.

394
00:37:03,354 --> 00:37:10,487

Why are you getting upset?

405
00:38:04,482 --> 00:38:06,382
I can't see Yash suffering
this way.

406
00:38:07,485 --> 00:38:09,453
I've decided that he
won't stay here.

407
00:38:10,321 --> 00:38:11,413
Take him to his grandma.

408
00:38:12,356 --> 00:38:14,449
But why? -I get angry on
every IittIe thing.

409
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:17,418
And these days,
I'm venting my anger on my son.

410
00:38:21,265 --> 00:38:23,233
I don't want him to
see me Iike this.

411
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:27,430
He has expectations from his papa.

412
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:30,497
How do I teII him that
I can't waIk?

413
00:38:33,511 --> 00:38:34,478
I won't get weII.

414

00:39:35,473 --> 00:39:37,304
'. . towards your son or not?'

416

When the department has given
you medicaI Ieave. .

417
00:39:51,455 --> 00:39:53,252
. . why do you've to resign?

418
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:56,292
Why did you resign? -The entire
department is with you.

419
00:39:56,327 --> 00:39:57,351
What eIse do you want?

420
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:59,329
And why did you stop
your physiotherapy?

421
00:39:59,363 --> 00:40:01,297
What do you want to prove
by doing that?

422
00:40:01,532 --> 00:40:03,295
How wiII that heIp?

423
00:40:04,468 --> 00:40:06,436
You're saying such great
things in the hospitaI.

424
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:09,268
That I'm one in a miIIion,
I'II do it. I'II do it.

425
00:40:09,507 --> 00:40:11,338
What happened to aII that?

426
00:40:13,477 --> 00:40:15,377
I don't beIieve that you're
the same Ajay.

427
00:40:15,479 --> 00:40:16,503
He's the same Ajay?

428
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:20,475
You've to join force, Ajay.

429
00:40:21,352 --> 00:40:23,411
You've to join duty again. -You've
to stand up on your feet again.

430
00:40:23,454 --> 00:40:24,443
That's my order.

431
00:40:25,322 --> 00:40:27,290
If you don't want to foIIow it,
Iet me know.

432
00:40:27,324 --> 00:40:28,416
I'II never see your face again.

433
00:40:30,394 --> 00:40:31,486
I just said it that

434
00:40:34,398 --> 00:40:35,490
I'm not one in a miIIion.

435
00:40:37,468 --> 00:40:38,492
I can't do it.

436
00:40:41,505 --> 00:40:42,494
I can't do it.

437
00:40:56,487 --> 00:40:59,479
'Mr. Ajay Shridhar has exposed
a fraud of 50 crore. . '

438
00:40:59,523 --> 00:41:02,390
'. . and saved GIobaI Life

'. . from a huge Ioss. '

440
00:41:04,428 --> 00:41:08,421
'And so, our company gifts him
a term poIicy of 5 crore. '

441
00:41:13,404 --> 00:41:14,393
What's up, Brother?

442
00:41:19,443 --> 00:41:22,310
What's this? -Insurance poIicy.

443
00:41:25,416 --> 00:41:26,440
It's for 5 crore.

444
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:30,409
I want to die.

445
00:41:31,455 --> 00:41:32,479
What? -What?

446
00:41:35,526 --> 00:41:37,494
And I need your heIp for that.

447
00:41:38,462 --> 00:41:40,327
Ajay, what're you bIabbering?

448
00:41:40,431 --> 00:41:41,489
Listen to me first.

449
00:41:44,301 --> 00:41:45,393
I can't Iive this way.

450
00:41:47,371 --> 00:41:48,497
I'II kiII myseIf any time.

451

And if I do that,

That's why I need your heIp.

Brother. . -Ajay.

456
00:42:09,293 --> 00:42:10,351
Doesn't make sense to me.

457
00:42:10,461 --> 00:42:13,396
What madness is this?
We don't want anything.

458
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:14,419
Nothing at aII.

459
00:42:14,465 --> 00:42:15,454
We just want you.

460
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,265
PIease stop thinking. . -Anshu.

Just once. . try to Iive
my Iife just once.

I'm suffering.

464
00:42:30,514 --> 00:42:32,311
I'm dying every moment.

465
00:42:32,349 --> 00:42:33,475
I don't want to hear anything,
Ajay.

466
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:35,451
Enough.
I don't want to taIk about this.

467
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:37,445
Why don't you understand?

468
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:40,314
I'm not insane.

469
00:42:40,491 --> 00:42:42,288
What do you want, Ajay?

470
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:45,420
That I shouId kiII you,
though I'm your wife.

471
00:42:49,533 --> 00:42:50,522
Sorry, brother.

472
00:43:05,516 --> 00:43:06,505
Look. .

473
00:43:08,285 --> 00:43:10,446
We won't get such a chance again.

474
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:15,415
And anyway,
we aren't going to kiII him.

475
00:43:17,361 --> 00:43:19,488
He wants to die himseIf.

476
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:45,479
Enough, Ajay, I can't
endure it any Ionger.

477
00:43:48,425 --> 00:43:50,393

00:47:38,488 --> 00:47:43,323
You may be right.
You may be wrong.

521
00:47:44,361 --> 00:47:47,296
You are going to be wrong.

522
00:47:47,331 --> 00:47:51,461
You may be right.
You may be wrong.

523
00:47:53,303 --> 00:47:54,463
In the theatre,
you'II have to do something. .

524
00:47:55,339 --> 00:47:57,364
. . so that pIenty of peopIe can
be an aIibi for you two. .

525
00:48:09,286 --> 00:48:10,310
Madam, your change.

526
00:48:11,288 --> 00:48:14,382
Stupid. -Sorry, madam'am. -Can't
you see? -Ma'am, I. .

527
00:48:14,424 --> 00:48:15,448
Madam, you dropped it.

528
00:48:16,426 --> 00:48:17,415
Do you know who she's?

529
00:48:17,527 --> 00:48:19,495
She's ACP Ajay Shridhar's wife.

530
00:48:19,529 --> 00:48:22,259
You'II rot behind bars aII your
Iife with just one phone caII.

531
00:48:22,299 --> 00:48:24,358
Get that. -Sorry,
sir. Sorry. -What happened?

532
00:48:25,402 --> 00:48:29,429
Is everything okay? -Yes, sir.

533
00:48:30,407 --> 00:48:31,396
Is Ajay aIone at home?

534
00:48:33,310 --> 00:48:34,504
Don't Ieave him aIone
so Iate in the night.

535
00:48:34,511 --> 00:48:37,275
You know the kind of mentaI trauma
he's facing these days.

536
00:48:37,347 --> 00:48:38,405
I didn't want to come.

537
00:48:39,316 --> 00:48:40,340
But Vinay, you know him.

538
00:48:40,517 --> 00:48:42,382
I don't get out of the house much.

539
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:44,412
But he was adamant today.

540
00:48:45,322 --> 00:48:46,346
You two need to go.

541
00:48:49,293 --> 00:48:50,385
Lead your own Iives and aII that.

542
00:48:51,528 --> 00:48:53,291
You know what?

543
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:55,330
She did come here to
watch the movie.

544
00:48:55,499 --> 00:48:57,467
But she's concerned
about brother Ajay.

545
00:48:59,536 --> 00:49:01,333
I need to go to the washroom.

546
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:06,434
HeIIo, Ajay. I think we need
to abort the pIan. -Why?

547
00:49:07,377 --> 00:49:09,402
Vinay has seen us together.
-Vinay?

548
00:49:10,347 --> 00:49:14,283
He's asking me weird questions.

549
00:49:14,351 --> 00:49:16,319
It's a good thing that Vinay
is present there.

550
00:49:16,353 --> 00:49:17,411
We won't get a better aIibi.

551
00:49:17,487 --> 00:49:18,476
That's good.

552
00:49:19,423 --> 00:49:23,519
You just be very carefuI.
-When you Ieave the theatre. .

553
00:49:24,294 --> 00:49:25,420
. . make sure that nobody
watches you.

554
00:49:27,431 --> 00:49:30,332
AII the best. -Okay, bye.

555
00:50:03,467 --> 00:50:05,367
Oh, no. -Yes, I think. .

556
00:50:06,336 --> 00:50:07,496
What happened? -Vinay.

557
00:50:08,472 --> 00:50:09,439
Wait.

558
00:51:00,457 --> 00:51:03,392
Anshu, take that bag from
the back seat and. .

559
00:51:30,353 --> 00:51:31,342
I'm very nervous.

560
00:51:33,323 --> 00:51:36,315
I don't think we should go
ahead with this plan.

561
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:38,418
What if something goes wrong?

562
00:51:38,528 --> 00:51:39,517
Have you gone mad?

563
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:42,455
You want to go back after
coming so far.

564
00:51:43,433 --> 00:51:45,424
Look, nothing will go wrong.

565
00:51:46,403 --> 00:51:48,371
Ajay has devised a
fooI-proof plan.

566
00:51:49,406 --> 00:51:51,374
No one saw us coming here.

567
00:51:52,342 --> 00:51:54,333
According to the people,
we're still in the theatre.

568
00:51:54,444 --> 00:51:56,412
No one saw us coming here.

569
00:51:58,381 --> 00:52:00,349
We'II enter the house as thieves.

570
00:52:01,351 --> 00:52:02,409
Two thieves enter that house.

571
00:52:02,486 --> 00:52:04,351
Ajay has a brawI with them.

572
00:52:04,488 --> 00:52:08,356
We go back home from the theatre
and find Ajay dead.

573
00:52:08,458 --> 00:52:11,427
We call the police.
It's as simple as that.

574
00:52:12,329 --> 00:52:14,297
Lot of people have seen
us in the theatre.

575
00:52:14,397 --> 00:52:15,421
They'll be our witness.

576
00:52:16,333 --> 00:52:18,358
Why. . why will anyone doubt us?

577
00:52:20,303 --> 00:52:21,361
Does that make sense to you?

578
00:52:22,372 --> 00:52:24,306
Is that clear? -Yes.

579
00:52:25,509 --> 00:52:27,409
Okay. Let's do it then.

580
00:53:12,389 --> 00:53:15,483
Did anyone see you coming here?
-No.

581
00:53:16,359 --> 00:53:17,348
Sure?

582
00:53:19,496 --> 00:53:21,293
Yes, we're sure.

583
00:53:22,365 --> 00:53:23,354
Ok.

584
00:53:38,481 --> 00:53:39,505
Don't be nervous.

585
00:53:43,453 --> 00:53:44,442
I love you.

586
00:54:08,445 --> 00:54:10,504
You're supposed to be in
the cinema, not here.

587
00:54:16,353 --> 00:54:17,342
Sorry.

588
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:29,364
Hello. -Papa.

589
00:54:30,433 --> 00:54:33,425
Son.
-Papa, I want to come see you.

590
00:54:33,536 --> 00:54:36,505
I miss you. -What happened, son?

591
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:39,408
Papa, I'd a nightmare.

592
00:54:39,442 --> 00:54:40,466
I'd a bad nightmare.

593
00:54:40,510 --> 00:54:42,375
First, stop crying.

594
00:54:45,315 --> 00:54:48,512
Son, you promised to be a strong
boy, isn't it? -Yes, Papa.

595
00:54:49,452 --> 00:54:51,511
If you're strong only
then can I leave.

596
00:54:52,422 --> 00:54:54,447
And if I go to USA,
I'll become all right.

597
00:54:55,392 --> 00:54:57,360
You want your papa to become
aII right, isn't it?

598
00:54:57,427 --> 00:55:00,419
Yes,
Papa, I want you to get well soon.

599
00:55:01,331 --> 00:55:03,492
So, you need to be strong, son.
-Okay, Papa.

600
00:55:04,334 --> 00:55:07,497
But can we meet before you leave?

601
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:13,276
Yes, son. We can.

602
00:55:13,510 --> 00:55:18,470
Can we meet tomorrow?
-Yes, we'll meet tomorrow.

603
00:55:19,482 --> 00:55:20,471
Okay.

604
00:55:21,418 --> 00:55:23,318
Okay, Papa. I love you.

605
00:55:25,322 --> 00:55:26,311
I love you too.

606
00:55:51,448 --> 00:55:52,437
Shoot me.

607
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:58,509
Shoot me!

608
00:57:08,458 --> 00:57:10,289
They were in the movie hall. .

609
00:57:11,461 --> 00:57:12,450
Where's Ajay?

610
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:19,360
Vinay, I've found this video
clip in Sanjay's mobile.

611
00:58:30,306 --> 00:58:32,433
Ajay said that he was
in the bedroom.

612
00:58:33,309 --> 00:58:36,403
And he heard glass shattering.

613
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:39,379
When he came out to investigate. .

614
00:58:39,482 --> 00:58:43,475
. . who it was and what
they wanted. .

615
00:58:44,287 --> 00:58:46,312
. . they opened fired at Ajay.

616
00:58:47,423 --> 00:58:50,358
And Ajay shot at them
in self-defence.

617
00:58:52,395 --> 00:58:53,487
When Ajay came closer and saw. .

618
00:59:00,436 --> 00:59:01,494
I don't understand one thing.

619
00:59:02,372 --> 00:59:04,237
Why did they change
the getup and. .

620
00:59:05,441 --> 00:59:07,500
Why did they want
to kill Ajay sir?

621
00:59:08,511 --> 00:59:11,446
You didn't see their video
recording on the phone. -No.

622
00:59:12,515 --> 00:59:14,380
They'd an affair.

623
00:59:18,421 --> 00:59:20,412
He has an insurance
policy of 5 crore.

624
00:59:21,524 --> 00:59:24,493
The husband is a crippled.
Get him out of the way.

625
00:59:24,527 --> 00:59:26,290
They'd made a plan.

626
00:59:26,296 --> 00:59:29,493
They tried to establish alibis
in the movie hall.

627
00:59:31,301 --> 00:59:33,360
With complete pIanning.
-Maybe they didn't know. .

628
00:59:33,403 --> 00:59:35,337
. . that it wasn't that
easy to kill Ajay.

629
00:59:36,472 --> 00:59:37,461
So, they got stuck.

630
00:59:38,374 --> 00:59:43,471
And Vinay, Ajay didn't know that. .

631
00:59:45,381 --> 00:59:49,442
I mean, sister-in-law and he. . 
they'd an affair.

632
00:59:52,288 --> 00:59:55,451
But now, what will happen
when he finds out?

633
01:00:20,350 --> 01:00:22,409
We did it, Sanju.

634
01:00:56,352 --> 01:00:57,341
Sanju.

635
01:01:27,450 --> 01:01:28,508
'You set us up. '

636
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:31,444
'You idiot. '

637
01:01:42,365 --> 01:01:44,299
'Those bullets are fake
just like you. '

638
01:01:46,536 --> 01:01:51,371
'I was dead the day
I saw you two. '

639
01:02:00,349 --> 01:02:03,318
'Anshu. Anshu. '

640
01:02:06,289 --> 01:02:07,278
'Anshu. '

641
01:02:19,435 --> 01:02:20,424
I did it.

642
01:02:22,305 --> 01:02:23,431
'I became one in million. '

643
01:02:25,341 --> 01:02:29,437
'I wanted to stand up on my
feet and surprise you. '

644
01:02:29,479 --> 01:02:30,446
Anshu.

645
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:36,335
'What if brother Ajay had died
when he was shot at?'

646
01:04:39,342 --> 01:04:40,434
'I'm not that fortunate. '

647
01:05:02,431 --> 01:05:03,489
Why?

648
01:05:08,471 --> 01:05:09,495
Why?

649
01:05:12,475 --> 01:05:15,410
Why? Why?

650
01:05:18,281 --> 01:05:21,409
Why?

651
01:05:29,325 --> 01:05:30,314
Why?

652
01:06:26,382 --> 01:06:28,350
Brother! Brother!

653
01:06:29,385 --> 01:06:31,376
No! No!

654
01:06:35,391 --> 01:06:37,359
Rosy, what's wrong?

655
01:06:43,332 --> 01:06:44,390
Papa, what happened?

656
01:06:54,443 --> 01:06:55,467
Nothing has happened.

657
01:06:59,415 --> 01:07:00,404
Nothing has happened.

658
01:07:00,483 --> 01:07:03,350
It was terrible.

659
01:07:04,387 --> 01:07:06,252
We can't lessen his pain.

660
01:07:06,489 --> 01:07:09,458
But we can try and not Iet
him suffer anymore.

661
01:07:11,494 --> 01:07:15,328
Vinay,
this is an open and shut case.

662
01:07:16,332 --> 01:07:20,496
CompIete the formalities as soon
as possible. -Yes, sir.

663
01:07:21,270 --> 01:07:25,297
I don't want Ajay's life to
become newspaper headlines.

664
01:07:40,356 --> 01:07:41,345
Hi.

665
01:07:44,326 --> 01:07:46,385
Hi. -Ho.

666
01:07:47,530 --> 01:07:52,331
Brother didn't come? -He's a
little busy with Ajay sir's case.

667
01:07:53,436 --> 01:07:56,462
We'll go home straight.
-No, I want to meet Ajay, first.

668
01:08:18,494 --> 01:08:20,291
This shouldn't have happened.

669
01:08:34,376 --> 01:08:36,367
Yash. -Hi, Aunt.

670
01:08:36,412 --> 01:08:40,348
Hi, son, how are you? -Aunt,
you've come after so many days.

671
01:08:40,382 --> 01:08:41,371
I know.

672
01:08:41,417 --> 01:08:43,476
Yash, are you fine?
-I'm absolutely fine.

673
01:08:44,386 --> 01:08:45,375
How are you?

674
01:08:46,422 --> 01:08:47,446
I'm fine, son.

675
01:08:49,325 --> 01:08:50,383
Come on, get to bed quickly.

676
01:08:53,295 --> 01:08:55,320
Go sleep, son.
-We'll meet again, okay? -Okay.

677
01:08:55,397 --> 01:08:57,262
Goodnight. -See you, Aunt.

678
01:08:57,299 --> 01:08:58,288
Goodnight.

679
01:08:58,367 --> 01:09:01,234
Goodnight, Papa. -Bye, son.

680
01:09:03,472 --> 01:09:07,374
Yash doesn't know, does he? -No.

681
01:09:12,481 --> 01:09:16,440
Aunt, look I won these trophies.
-Wow.

682
01:09:16,485 --> 01:09:18,248
I won this for football.

683
01:09:18,354 --> 01:09:21,289
And this for dancing.
-Dancing too.

684
01:09:21,323 --> 01:09:22,483
Wow. Let me see.

685
01:09:23,425 --> 01:09:25,256
Wow, very good.

686
01:09:25,361 --> 01:09:26,453
Congratulations. -Thank you.

687
01:09:27,429 --> 01:09:29,454
I'm very proud of you,
you know that. -Thank you.

688
01:09:30,332 --> 01:09:33,358
I'm my papa's son.
-Yes, of course, you're.

689
01:09:36,305 --> 01:09:37,431
Yash. -Yes.

690
01:09:38,440 --> 01:09:41,466
Can I share a secret with you?
-Okay.

691
01:09:42,444 --> 01:09:45,345
You'll keep it a secret,
won't you? -Yes, Aunt, of course.

692
01:09:46,348 --> 01:09:47,372
Good boy.

693
01:09:47,516 --> 01:09:54,354
Son, you know what your
papa is going through.

694
01:09:55,391 --> 01:09:57,256
I mean after the accident. .

695
01:09:57,393 --> 01:10:01,295
I mean how he has suffered. . 
-Yes, Aunt. I know.

696
01:10:01,463 --> 01:10:03,488
He stays upset. -Yes.

697
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:07,367
And we'll have to encourage
him now.

698
01:10:07,536 --> 01:10:09,265
Okay.

699
01:10:15,477 --> 01:10:16,466
Your mummy. .

700
01:10:25,421 --> 01:10:28,390
There was a robbery at home.
-Robbery?

701
01:10:28,524 --> 01:10:33,359
Yes.
And your papa, he was very brave.

702
01:10:34,330 --> 01:10:36,298
Your papa was very brave,
you know that.

703
01:10:36,498 --> 01:10:38,295
He fought with the robbers.

704
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:39,389
He fought them.

705
01:10:39,501 --> 01:10:42,470
But there was crossfire of guns.

706
01:10:43,505 --> 01:10:44,472
And in that. .

707
01:10:46,408 --> 01:10:48,273
Your mummy got shot, baby.

708
01:10:50,546 --> 01:10:52,446
Mamma is no more, baby.

709
01:10:57,519 --> 01:10:59,316
Mamma's gone to heaven.

710
01:11:05,361 --> 01:11:06,385
Sorry.

711
01:11:08,364 --> 01:11:10,355
That's okay.

712
01:11:11,333 --> 01:11:12,322
Come. That's okay.

713
01:11:35,357 --> 01:11:36,346
Yes, Radhika.

714
01:11:36,392 --> 01:11:38,485
Brother, I've reached home.

715
01:11:39,528 --> 01:11:42,463
When are you coming?
-It'II take me some time.

716
01:11:43,465 --> 01:11:48,425
How is Ajay?
-What can I say, Brother?

717
01:11:49,371 --> 01:11:51,305
I pray that God isn't
so crueI with anyone.

718
01:11:51,507 --> 01:11:53,441
He's compIeteIy shattered
from within.

719
01:11:54,410 --> 01:11:57,470
But he's trying to be
strong for Yash.

720
01:11:59,415 --> 01:12:01,349
Ajay is a fighter.

721
01:12:01,483 --> 01:12:07,319
It'II be difficuIt but he'II come
out of it. -I hope, Brother.

722
01:12:08,324 --> 01:12:10,292
If you come home,
we'II eat together.

723
01:12:10,459 --> 01:12:12,393
I'II be there after I finish.

724
01:12:12,461 --> 01:12:14,326
You better eat. -Fine, Brother.

725
01:12:14,496 --> 01:12:15,485
Yeah!

726
01:12:20,402 --> 01:12:21,460
Ajay's fiIe is aImost compIete.

727
01:12:23,305 --> 01:12:24,499
Take a quick gIance over it.

728
01:12:25,541 --> 01:12:27,372
We make so many fiIes everyday.

729
01:12:29,445 --> 01:12:31,504
But I never thought we'II
have to make a fiIe. .

730
01:12:36,452 --> 01:12:37,510
. . for one of our own.

731
01:12:57,373 --> 01:12:59,364
I stiII can't beIieve that
Anshita can do this.

732
01:13:01,510 --> 01:13:03,444
I'm worried about Ajay.

733
01:13:06,415 --> 01:13:07,507
What might he be going through?

734
01:13:09,485 --> 01:13:11,419
He inadvertentIy shot at them.

735
01:13:12,521 --> 01:13:16,321
But I wouId've shot
them advertentIy.

736
01:13:20,462 --> 01:13:23,363
'And Ajay shot at them
in seIf-defence. '

737
01:13:26,435 --> 01:13:28,369
'I don't get out of
the house much. '

738
01:13:28,504 --> 01:13:31,473
'But he was adamant today,
that you two had to go. '

739
01:13:32,408 --> 01:13:33,500
'He was in the bedroom and. . '

740
01:13:33,542 --> 01:13:36,375
'. . heard the noise of
gIass shattering. '

741
01:13:37,513 --> 01:13:40,346
'Before he couId know
what's going on. . '

742
01:13:40,516 --> 01:13:42,381
'. . they shot at Ajay. '

743
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:54,386
Where are you going, Vinay?
TeII me.

744
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:40,272
We've compIeted aII the
formaIities, Mr. Patnaik.

745
01:14:40,509 --> 01:14:42,477
Then why do you want to see
the dead bodies again?

746
01:14:42,544 --> 01:14:44,273
Just Iike that.

747
01:14:44,513 --> 01:14:46,310
I'm actuaIIy missing them both.

748
01:15:51,346 --> 01:15:52,335
You're compIeteIy drenched.

749
01:15:53,348 --> 01:15:55,213
Get a toweI for sir. -Ok, sir.

750
01:16:12,467 --> 01:16:14,332
What's wrong?
Why are you so tensed?

751
01:16:15,337 --> 01:16:16,463
WouId you Iike to have a drink?
-Yes.

752
01:16:19,241 --> 01:16:20,333
Get a drink for sir. -Ok.

753
01:16:36,491 --> 01:16:40,427
Ajay, you knew, didn't you? -What?

754
01:16:41,296 --> 01:16:44,459
That your brother and Anshita
were having an affair.

755
01:16:48,403 --> 01:16:50,462
You pIanned their murder,
didn't you?

756
01:16:55,410 --> 01:16:56,377
Wrong.

757
01:16:59,481 --> 01:17:00,470
You're Iying.

758
01:17:04,353 --> 01:17:07,516
I'm questioning you as a friend,
don't try to hide it.

759
01:17:08,523 --> 01:17:12,323
Friends don't ask such questions.

760
01:17:13,328 --> 01:17:15,353
Ajay, you know, I don't question
without a reason.

761
01:17:16,465 --> 01:17:19,491
TeII me.
-I opened fire in seIf-defence.

762
01:17:22,504 --> 01:17:29,342
And I didn't know anything. . 
about their affair.

763
01:17:46,328 --> 01:17:47,317
Fine.

764
01:17:52,401 --> 01:17:54,335
I questioned you Iike a friend. .

765
01:17:54,369 --> 01:17:55,495
. . and you answered
Iike a criminaI.

766
01:17:57,472 --> 01:17:59,497
So,
now, you'II meet a poIice officer.

767
01:18:08,517 --> 01:18:10,382
Thanks for the drinks. See you.

768
01:18:21,363 --> 01:18:24,230
You? At this hour?

769
01:18:24,433 --> 01:18:25,491
What happened? Patnaik?

770
01:18:26,401 --> 01:18:27,493
Is everything okay?

771
01:18:28,370 --> 01:18:30,361
Yes, sir.
Ajay. . -What happened to Ajay?

772
01:18:31,373 --> 01:18:34,501
Nothing. -You're compIeteIy
drenched. Come in.

773
01:18:35,410 --> 01:18:36,399
Come, come.

774
01:18:37,312 --> 01:18:38,370
Are you out of your senses?

775
01:18:39,448 --> 01:18:41,313
How can anyone think about it?

776
01:18:41,483 --> 01:18:44,316
Ajay has given his entire Iife
to the poIice department.

777
01:18:44,519 --> 01:18:46,384
He aImost sacrificed his Iife.

778
01:18:46,521 --> 01:18:49,422
And you doubt him.

779
01:18:50,525 --> 01:18:53,460
And we aII know that his
wife had betrayed him.

780
01:18:55,464 --> 01:18:56,488
She wanted to kiII him.

781
01:18:57,365 --> 01:18:59,356
Ajay shot back in seIf-defence.

782
01:19:00,535 --> 01:19:05,404
He didn't know that his murderers
were his wife and brother.

783
01:19:10,412 --> 01:19:11,436
And what if he'd known?

784
01:19:17,385 --> 01:19:18,409
Sir.

785
01:19:20,255 --> 01:19:23,281
Sir, put yourseIf in his
shoes for a moment.

786
01:19:24,326 --> 01:19:27,227
A man who raises his brother.

787
01:19:27,429 --> 01:19:29,454
A man who Ioves his wife a Iot.

788
01:19:30,232 --> 01:19:32,393
And both of them have an
affair behind his back.

789
01:19:32,467 --> 01:19:34,401
What wiII that man feeI
in that situation?

790
01:19:34,402 --> 01:19:35,494
WiII he sit there doing nothing?

791
01:19:36,304 --> 01:19:38,272
He knew what Iine of action
the poIice wiII take.

792
01:19:38,340 --> 01:19:39,364
He was a poIice officer.

793
01:19:39,441 --> 01:19:40,430
He has created aIibis.

794
01:19:40,509 --> 01:19:42,340
He has waited for the right time.

795
01:19:42,477 --> 01:19:44,468
It's not a case of
seIf-defence sir.

796
01:19:44,513 --> 01:19:46,276
It's a case of murder.

797
01:19:48,517 --> 01:19:51,315
Patnaik, a man Iike Ajay. .

798
01:19:51,486 --> 01:19:54,319
. . can never murder his
wife and brother.

799
01:19:54,523 --> 01:19:56,252
Do you've evidence?

800
01:19:56,358 --> 01:19:57,518
Do you've proof? -I've proof.

801
01:19:57,526 --> 01:19:59,289
I need permission to
interrogate Ajay.

802
01:19:59,327 --> 01:20:01,295
Give me permission to investigate.
-No. No way.

803
01:20:01,396 --> 01:20:03,387
I won't give you permission
to inquire. .

804
01:20:03,431 --> 01:20:05,399
. . against an officer Iike Ajay
Shridhar. -Sir, pIease.

805
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:07,368
My biggest mistake
was that I made. .

806
01:20:07,402 --> 01:20:09,336
. . you the in-charge of this case.

807
01:20:09,437 --> 01:20:11,462
And now, you're trying to settIe
your personaI score.

808
01:20:11,540 --> 01:20:13,405
PersonaI score?
-No more discussion.

809
01:20:13,441 --> 01:20:14,430
He's my friend, sir.

810
01:20:14,476 --> 01:20:15,465
I'm taking this case away
from you right now.

811
01:20:15,510 --> 01:20:17,341
Sir, it's poIice officer's
duty to find the truth.

812
01:20:17,379 --> 01:20:19,347
Now, D'souza wiII handIe the case.
-No.

813
01:20:44,472 --> 01:20:50,433
Vinay, now, I'm the in-charge
of the Ajay Shridhar case.

814
01:20:56,518 --> 01:20:57,507
Thank you.

815
01:21:09,464 --> 01:21:11,364
A poIice officer Iike Ajay sir.

816
01:21:13,401 --> 01:21:15,426
He sacrificed his entire Iife
for the poIice department.

817
01:21:17,405 --> 01:21:19,305
He took a buIIet on duty
and was crippIed.

818
01:21:21,243 --> 01:21:22,471
He hasn't recovered from
that shock yet.

819
01:21:23,411 --> 01:21:26,380
Instead of supporting him,
we his so caIIed friends. .

820
01:21:26,481 --> 01:21:28,415
. . are trying to frame
him as a criminaI. .

821
01:21:28,483 --> 01:21:30,314
. . and send him behind bars.

822
01:21:32,420 --> 01:21:34,388
We did our duty very weII.

823
01:21:35,357 --> 01:21:37,325
We shouId be awarded goId
medaIs for it, More.

824
01:21:45,300 --> 01:21:47,325
This fiIe has been snatched
from me and given to you. .

825
01:21:48,370 --> 01:21:49,496
. . so that you can understand
the truth.

826
01:21:51,439 --> 01:21:53,373
When you donned the uniform
and took oath. .

827
01:21:53,441 --> 01:21:55,306
. . it was for protecting the Iaw.

828
01:21:55,543 --> 01:21:57,443
And not to write poems
in friendship.

829
01:22:04,352 --> 01:22:05,341
Sir.

830
01:22:08,356 --> 01:22:09,345
Sir.

831
01:22:12,460 --> 01:22:15,429
What's right and what's wrong?

832
01:22:17,299 --> 01:22:19,460
It's just your state of mind.

833
01:22:21,436 --> 01:22:25,395
What's right and what's wrong?
It's just your state of mind.

834
01:22:25,540 --> 01:22:29,374
The meaning of Iife is different
for everyone.

835
01:22:29,477 --> 01:22:30,466
No, Ajay.

836
01:22:33,348 --> 01:22:34,315
My friend.

837
01:22:37,452 --> 01:22:39,386
It's not about you and me anymore.

838
01:22:41,489 --> 01:22:43,354
It's about true and faIse now.

839
01:22:47,295 --> 01:22:48,353
PIease forgive me.

840
01:22:49,431 --> 01:22:51,490
Last night, an anonymous
person caIIed Zee News. .

841
01:22:51,499 --> 01:22:53,364
. . and informed us that
Anshita Shridhar. .

842
01:22:53,435 --> 01:22:55,460
. . and Sanjay's death wasn't
an accident but a murder.

843
01:22:56,304 --> 01:22:58,363
The poIice is trying to
cover up this case. .

844
01:22:58,406 --> 01:23:01,341
. . because this case concerns
a high poIice officiaI. .

845
01:23:01,343 --> 01:23:04,506
. . Ajay Shridhar. -We've been
informed that Anshita Shridhar. .

846
01:23:05,313 --> 01:23:07,406
. . and her cousin were
having an affair.

847
01:23:07,449 --> 01:23:10,316
And Ajay Shridhar found
out about it.

848
01:23:12,354 --> 01:23:14,322
What's going on in your
department, Deshmukh sir?

849
01:23:14,522 --> 01:23:16,387
I was just going to taIk to you.

850
01:23:16,491 --> 01:23:19,517
In fact, I wanted to meet the
home minister personaIIy.

851
01:23:20,328 --> 01:23:21,386
There's no need for that.

852
01:23:21,429 --> 01:23:23,454
For now,
you heIp the inquiry commission.

853
01:23:25,467 --> 01:23:27,298
Sir. Sir, pIease. -Sir.

854
01:23:27,335 --> 01:23:29,428
Sir, we've heard that an inquiry
commission has been. .

855
01:23:29,471 --> 01:23:30,369
. . appointed against Ajay Shridhar.

856
01:23:30,438 --> 01:23:32,338
Why are you asking me when
you aIready know?

857
01:23:32,374 --> 01:23:34,365
Sir, what action wiII the poIice
take? -No comments.

858
01:23:34,442 --> 01:23:36,410
Sir, the poIice, first, tried
to save Ajay Shridhar. .

859
01:23:36,444 --> 01:23:39,311
. . and now you're appointing an
inquiry commission against him.

860
01:23:39,381 --> 01:23:40,370
Why?

861
01:23:40,382 --> 01:23:41,371
Answer us, sir.

862
01:23:46,421 --> 01:23:48,286
So, you've started your game.

863
01:23:48,323 --> 01:23:50,291
You can get an inquiry
commission appointed. .

864
01:23:50,325 --> 01:23:51,417
. . by pressurising me
through the media.

865
01:23:51,459 --> 01:23:54,326
Don't bIame me for the media, sir.
-I know, I know.

866
01:23:54,362 --> 01:23:55,454
You've chaIIenged my authority. .

867
01:23:55,497 --> 01:23:57,397
. . by approaching the
home minister.

868
01:23:58,299 --> 01:24:00,324
But understand onething, Patnaik.

869
01:24:00,535 --> 01:24:02,400
The path you're waIking on. .

870
01:24:03,338 --> 01:24:04,464
. . I don't know what wiII
happen to Ajay.

871
01:24:05,473 --> 01:24:09,307
But maybe, you don't know
what'II happen to you.

872
01:24:19,354 --> 01:24:21,322
We've just Iearnt from
trusted resources. .

873
01:24:21,356 --> 01:24:24,382
. . that Ajay's wife Anshita
Shridhar and Sanjay's death. .

874
01:24:24,526 --> 01:24:26,494
. . wasn't an accident but
a pIanned murder.

875
01:24:27,429 --> 01:24:30,421
It's being said that Ajay Shridhar
hatched a conspiracy. .

876
01:24:30,498 --> 01:24:31,487
. . and murdered them.

877
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:34,334
The Home Secretary has decided. .

878
01:24:34,369 --> 01:24:36,269
. . to appoint an inquiry
commission against him.

879
01:24:36,304 --> 01:24:39,501
Because of which Ajay. . -Papa.

880
01:24:42,343 --> 01:24:43,310
Son.

881
01:24:44,479 --> 01:24:45,468
What happened, Son?

882
01:24:45,513 --> 01:24:49,449
Papa, are you Ieaving me?
-I'm not going anywhere.

883
01:24:50,318 --> 01:24:51,342
What's wrong with you?

884
01:24:52,387 --> 01:24:54,355
Papa, are you going to jaiI?

885
01:24:55,390 --> 01:24:58,325
Who said that? -My friend.

886
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:01,294
No, son. I'm not going anywhere.

887
01:25:01,329 --> 01:25:03,297
PIease don't go. -No, son.

888
01:25:03,331 --> 01:25:05,356
Don't go anywhere.
-No, son. I won't go anywhere.

889
01:25:44,305 --> 01:25:47,399
Ajay, we know the mentaI stress
you're going through.

890
01:25:49,244 --> 01:25:50,370
But protocoI is protocoI.

891
01:25:51,379 --> 01:25:54,348
We expect your fuII cooperation
in this inquiry.

892
01:25:55,517 --> 01:25:59,351
According to this case, there are
a few charges against you.

893
01:25:59,521 --> 01:26:02,456
Investigation officer Vinay
Patnaik beIieves that. .

894
01:26:03,358 --> 01:26:07,419
. . you knew about the affair
between your wife and cousin.

895
01:26:08,329 --> 01:26:10,320
They didn't make this pIan,
you did.

896
01:26:10,431 --> 01:26:11,489
It was a pIanned murder.

897
01:26:12,467 --> 01:26:15,334
In your statement,
you've covered up the murder. .

898
01:26:15,370 --> 01:26:18,464
. . as seIf-defence to
misIead the poIice.

899
01:26:20,341 --> 01:26:22,309
GuiIty or not guiIty.

900
01:26:23,244 --> 01:26:24,268
Not guiIty.

901
01:26:32,353 --> 01:26:33,377
Vinay. -Sir.

902
01:26:36,324 --> 01:26:39,487
Ajay, teII me something?

903
01:26:40,528 --> 01:26:45,295
Can you waIk? -What kind of
a question is that, Vinay?

904
01:26:45,466 --> 01:26:47,434
We aII know that Ajay can't waIk.

905
01:26:48,336 --> 01:26:50,463
Then why are you. . 
-Sir, just a simpIe question.

906
01:26:50,505 --> 01:26:52,268
He has to say yes or no.

907
01:26:54,375 --> 01:26:55,342
I can't waIk.

908
01:26:59,447 --> 01:27:01,506
So, when they shot at you,
there must be at Ieast. .

909
01:27:02,317 --> 01:27:03,477
. . this much distance between
you and them.

910
01:27:04,485 --> 01:27:06,214
A IittIe further.

911
01:27:08,389 --> 01:27:09,481
This much?

912
01:27:10,525 --> 01:27:13,289
You came out of the bedroom
on your wheeIchair.

913
01:27:13,361 --> 01:27:16,489
They saw you and shot at you.

914
01:27:18,366 --> 01:27:19,355
You ducked.

915
01:27:20,335 --> 01:27:23,395
The buIIet hit the wheeIchair
and passed through it.

916
01:27:24,372 --> 01:27:25,339
Right.

917
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:27,340
Then you took your gun
out of the drawer. .

918
01:27:27,508 --> 01:27:30,409
. . and fired at them,
sitting on this wheeIchair.

919
01:27:30,545 --> 01:27:33,514
And they died, right? -Right.

920
01:27:35,383 --> 01:27:36,372
HoId on.

921
01:27:48,529 --> 01:27:50,326
This is Ajay on his chair.

922
01:27:50,431 --> 01:27:51,523
Two peopIe are standing here.

923
01:27:52,300 --> 01:27:53,324
If he shoots from here. .

924
01:27:54,369 --> 01:27:56,360
. . it wiII traveI this way
in an upward direction.

925
01:27:57,338 --> 01:27:58,327
AImost 45 degrees.

926
01:27:59,374 --> 01:28:03,470
The buIIet that hit Sanjay. . 
its trajectory is simiIar.

927
01:28:04,312 --> 01:28:05,279
Upwards.

928
01:28:05,480 --> 01:28:08,472
Now. . the buIIet that hit his wife.

929
01:28:09,450 --> 01:28:11,475
Its angIe is paraIIeI.

930
01:28:12,420 --> 01:28:14,479
ParaIIeI to the ground.
180 degrees.

931
01:28:22,363 --> 01:28:26,231
And that's possibIe when the
attacker stands up and shoots.

932
01:28:26,434 --> 01:28:28,299
'Why? Why? Why?'

933
01:28:32,407 --> 01:28:33,465
CouId you expIain to me, sir?

934
01:28:47,422 --> 01:28:49,322
Before I couId reach my revoIver. .

935
01:28:49,424 --> 01:28:51,324
. . I threw whatever I
couId get at him.

936
01:28:51,392 --> 01:28:53,292
And simiIarIy,
she went down on her knees.

937
01:28:56,331 --> 01:28:57,320
And then I fired.

938
01:28:59,500 --> 01:29:05,302
180 degrees, paraIIeI. Right.

939
01:29:14,482 --> 01:29:16,382
You didn't say that
in your statement.

940
01:29:17,318 --> 01:29:20,378
When there's such a big deIusion
right in front of your eyes. .

941
01:29:22,390 --> 01:29:23,379
What can one say?

942
01:29:26,260 --> 01:29:27,352
What did you throw at her?

943
01:29:33,334 --> 01:29:35,461
DoIphins. Show piece.

944
01:29:37,538 --> 01:29:41,372
Anymore questions.
-No more questions.

945
01:29:42,377 --> 01:29:45,346
Sir, I'm going to America
for my treatment.

946
01:29:46,381 --> 01:29:50,283
But I'II stay here untiI you
give me a cIean chit.

947
01:29:52,520 --> 01:29:54,317
I'm surrendering my passport.

948
01:30:11,406 --> 01:30:15,308
Papa, are you okay?
-I'm fine, son.

949
01:30:16,344 --> 01:30:18,335
Dear, Iet him rest for a whiIe.
-Yes.

950
01:30:18,379 --> 01:30:19,403
Now, go and pIay.

951
01:30:23,384 --> 01:30:25,443
I don't understand how brother
can think Iike this.

952
01:30:27,488 --> 01:30:29,319
This shouIdn't have happened.

953
01:30:30,425 --> 01:30:31,414
I'II taIk to him.

954
01:30:44,439 --> 01:30:45,406
I'm so sorry.

955
01:30:54,449 --> 01:30:55,507
CIose up. CIose up.

956
01:30:56,451 --> 01:30:57,475
Both front and back side.

957
01:30:58,486 --> 01:31:00,420
And I want photographs
of every corner. .

958
01:31:00,455 --> 01:31:02,355
. . of the room where the
crime was committed.

959
01:31:02,390 --> 01:31:04,381
Don't try to use your brain,
Iet it rest.

960
01:31:04,425 --> 01:31:05,414
Just do as I say.

961
01:31:06,394 --> 01:31:08,385
And I want aII the photographs
on my desk by morning.

962
01:31:09,297 --> 01:31:10,286
Any doubt?

963
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:14,300
Lousy dumb-headed creatures,
I teII you.

964
01:31:14,535 --> 01:31:16,435
Brother it's not a duty
something eIse.

965
01:31:18,406 --> 01:31:20,374
Everyone wouId teII me but
I wouIdn't beIieve it.

966
01:31:21,342 --> 01:31:22,502
But now, I feeI. . 
-What do you feeI?

967
01:31:23,411 --> 01:31:24,400
I'm jeaIous of him.

968
01:31:25,346 --> 01:31:26,472
I want his position
in the department.

969
01:31:27,348 --> 01:31:28,406
I'm being personaI with him.

970
01:31:28,483 --> 01:31:29,472
What do you think?

971
01:31:30,318 --> 01:31:31,512
This is a case of pIanned murder.

972
01:31:32,353 --> 01:31:33,377
Why can't you see that?

973
01:31:33,421 --> 01:31:34,410
Have you gone bIind?

974
01:31:34,455 --> 01:31:36,286
Do you want me to beIieve
what aII of you do?

975
01:31:36,324 --> 01:31:37,348
How can you say that?

976
01:31:37,391 --> 01:31:39,416
What evidence do you've to prove
that he's a murderer?

977
01:31:39,460 --> 01:31:41,394
What proof do you've to
prove him innocent?

978
01:31:42,330 --> 01:31:43,388
Brother, I'm a Iawyer.

979
01:31:43,431 --> 01:31:45,331
I've studied this case.

980
01:31:45,466 --> 01:31:47,366
You're making a case
out of nothing.

981
01:31:47,435 --> 01:31:49,300
And you couIdn't understand Ajay. .

982
01:31:49,337 --> 01:31:50,497
. . after being with him
for so many years.

983
01:31:51,305 --> 01:31:52,431
And I've understood
him in a few days.

984
01:31:52,440 --> 01:31:54,305
You've understood, exceIIent.

985
01:31:54,442 --> 01:31:56,501
It's better if you don't taIk
about understanding men.

986
01:31:57,411 --> 01:31:59,379
What happened to your
understanding about Avinash?

987
01:31:59,447 --> 01:32:00,471
Were you not in your senses then?

988
01:32:00,515 --> 01:32:02,506
Brother, pIease. -I kept saying. .

989
01:32:03,317 --> 01:32:04,477
Radhika, he's not a right man.
He's not a right man.

990
01:32:04,519 --> 01:32:06,384
Don't marry him,
don't marry him.

991
01:32:06,420 --> 01:32:09,389
No, Brother. I know him he's a
nice guy. -He understands me.

992
01:32:09,457 --> 01:32:12,324
Understands you. -He Ieft you
and ruined your entire Iife.

993
01:32:12,326 --> 01:32:13,452
Yet you taIk about
understanding men!

994
01:32:22,503 --> 01:32:23,492
God.

995
01:33:01,509 --> 01:33:04,342
'What did you throw at her?
-DoIphins. '

996
01:33:12,520 --> 01:33:15,284
Was it this piece?

997
01:33:21,295 --> 01:33:23,286
The other day, you said you
hurIed this piece at her. .

998
01:33:23,364 --> 01:33:24,353
. . and she ducked.

999
01:33:24,498 --> 01:33:26,466
If you hurIed it at her,
it shouId've broken.

1000
01:33:27,468 --> 01:33:28,457
SecondIy.

1001
01:33:29,537 --> 01:33:32,370
Why is this piece here now?

1002
01:34:09,410 --> 01:34:10,468
I'd two of them.

1003
01:34:11,412 --> 01:34:13,380
Then why didn't we find
it at the murder spot.

1004
01:34:13,414 --> 01:34:15,314
I found it under the dining tabIe.

1005
01:34:16,484 --> 01:34:18,418
You didn't search properIy.

1006
01:34:19,387 --> 01:34:20,445
You've kept them very safeIy.

1007
01:34:23,424 --> 01:34:26,518
These doIphins saved my Iife.

1008
01:34:31,532 --> 01:34:37,334
Anymore questions.
-No more questions.

1009
01:34:43,310 --> 01:34:45,278
'It wasn't easy to defeat
Ajay at this game. '

1010
01:34:45,413 --> 01:34:47,381
'We couIdn't do anything
without hard evidence. '

1011
01:34:47,515 --> 01:34:49,483
'We've to think Iike Ajay
in order to naiI him. '

1012
01:34:55,489 --> 01:34:57,423
'Ajay had convinced Sanjay
and Anshita. . '

1013
01:34:57,425 --> 01:34:59,359
'. . that it was a fooIproof
pIan for them. '

1014
01:34:59,460 --> 01:35:02,452
'The pIan was fooIproof but
not for them. For Ajay. '

1015
01:35:03,330 --> 01:35:04,422
'Did anyone see you coming?'

1016
01:35:06,400 --> 01:35:08,334
'They must've brought
these oversized. . '

1017
01:35:08,402 --> 01:35:09,460
'. . cIothes from some market. '

1018
01:35:10,337 --> 01:35:11,361
'Find it, find it. '

1019
01:35:18,446 --> 01:35:20,414
'Where did they hire the car from?
'

1020
01:35:20,448 --> 01:35:22,416
'Did Ajay personaIIy
go to hire the car?'

1021
01:35:33,360 --> 01:35:34,520
'Smart, very smart. '

1022
01:35:35,396 --> 01:35:37,387
'Ajay had sent Sanjay and
Anshita everywhere. '

1023
01:35:37,465 --> 01:35:40,434
'So that we don't suspect Ajay
whiIe investigating. '

1024
01:35:46,507 --> 01:35:48,475
'We'II have to find out where
they got the gun from. '

1025
01:35:57,418 --> 01:35:58,476
Yes, teII me.

1026
01:35:59,320 --> 01:36:01,413
Sir, we've found him. -Who?

1027
01:36:01,522 --> 01:36:03,217
The gun deaIer, sir.

1028
01:36:04,391 --> 01:36:05,483
Bring him to me. -Okay, sir.

1029
01:36:49,503 --> 01:36:52,438
D'souza, prepare to Ieave.

1030
01:36:53,340 --> 01:36:55,365
We've to go to make an arrest.
-Where?

1031
01:37:10,524 --> 01:37:14,358
UncIe Vinay, you? -Yes.

1032
01:37:15,396 --> 01:37:17,421
How are you, son? -I'm fine.

1033
01:37:17,464 --> 01:37:19,295
You came after so many days.

1034
01:37:19,366 --> 01:37:22,392
Papa, uncIe Vinay is here.

1035
01:38:02,376 --> 01:38:03,502
Son, go to your room.

1036
01:38:05,479 --> 01:38:06,468
Come.

1037
01:38:13,387 --> 01:38:14,479
Ajay, you'II have to come with us.

1038
01:38:18,425 --> 01:38:19,414
We've a warrant.

1039
01:38:20,294 --> 01:38:21,283
You can't do that.

1040
01:38:22,229 --> 01:38:23,457
I knew that you can
do such a thing.

1041
01:38:25,232 --> 01:38:26,256
Anticipatory baiI.

1042
01:38:29,370 --> 01:38:31,463
When did you start
practising again?

1043
01:38:32,439 --> 01:38:33,406
Right now.

1044
01:38:35,309 --> 01:38:38,278
Brother, you're doing what
you think is right.

1045
01:38:39,280 --> 01:38:43,341
And as his Iawyer,
I'II do what I think is right.

1046
01:38:45,486 --> 01:38:48,284
I'II see you in the court.
-See you in the court.

1047
01:38:50,457 --> 01:38:51,446
Okay.

1048
01:39:04,238 --> 01:39:05,398
Before starting the case. .

1049
01:39:06,340 --> 01:39:08,501
. . prosecution and defence
shouId remember. .

1050
01:39:09,243 --> 01:39:11,302
. . that this is a speedy triaI.

1051
01:39:12,379 --> 01:39:15,246
So, the court's time
shouIdn't be wasted.

1052
01:39:15,416 --> 01:39:17,350
Prosecution, pIease proceed.

1053
01:39:19,453 --> 01:39:21,387
I'II come straight to the point.

1054
01:39:21,522 --> 01:39:24,457
Instead of your treatment
and having. .

1055
01:39:24,525 --> 01:39:27,221
. . such a strong wiII-power. .

1056
01:39:27,428 --> 01:39:28,417
. . he couIdn't waIk.

1057
01:39:29,296 --> 01:39:31,355
A patient can not necessariIy
start waIking. .

1058
01:39:31,398 --> 01:39:33,366
. . because of his wiII-power.

1059
01:39:34,301 --> 01:39:35,359
And it isn't important that. .

1060
01:39:35,402 --> 01:39:38,337
. . a man shouId teII the doctor
that he can waIk.

1061
01:39:39,406 --> 01:39:43,342
If that was true then I'd
be the first to know.

1062
01:39:45,479 --> 01:39:47,413
Look, Your Honour. . 
-Thank you very much.

1063
01:39:47,448 --> 01:39:48,472
That's aII, Your Honour.

1064
01:39:50,351 --> 01:39:53,377
Your Honour,
now, I'II present to the court. .

1065
01:39:53,454 --> 01:39:56,423
. . a witness who'II prove
that Ajay can waIk.

1066
01:39:59,526 --> 01:40:03,360
And he's Sea SheII buiIding's
watchman Madhav Gajanan.

1067
01:40:14,408 --> 01:40:18,435
The man who entered fIat
number 203 on 24th JuIy.

1068
01:40:19,346 --> 01:40:22,315
Is he present here at the moment?

1069
01:40:32,459 --> 01:40:36,418
No, sir, he isn't.
-What are you saying?

1070
01:40:37,464 --> 01:40:39,295
Isn't he that man?

1071
01:40:47,374 --> 01:40:48,341
He isn't the one.

1072
01:40:51,445 --> 01:40:54,312
Look cIoseIy, was it him?

1073
01:41:08,328 --> 01:41:10,421
Yes, he's the man who
came in the buiIding.

1074
01:41:10,531 --> 01:41:12,328
Thank you, Gajanan.

1075
01:41:27,514 --> 01:41:29,448
Sir, you went to 203, didn't you?

1076
01:41:32,352 --> 01:41:36,482
302. -You went to 203. Sir.

1077
01:41:39,293 --> 01:41:45,254
Your Honour, Ajay Shridhar
is a master of disguises.

1078
01:41:45,399 --> 01:41:47,424
And he can fooI anyone
with his get-up.

1079
01:41:48,368 --> 01:41:50,393
That's why he's aIso
caIIed the master. .

1080
01:41:50,471 --> 01:41:52,405
. . of disguise in his department.

1081
01:41:53,407 --> 01:41:56,308
Take a Iook.

1082
01:41:57,411 --> 01:42:01,370
Your Honour, we've made a sketch. .

1083
01:42:02,416 --> 01:42:05,442
. . of aII the get-ups that
he has donned untiI now.

1084
01:42:06,320 --> 01:42:10,347
According to Gajanan,
he saw Ajay Shridhar. .

1085
01:42:10,424 --> 01:42:15,521
. . enter room number 203
in Sea SheII buiIding.

1086
01:42:16,530 --> 01:42:19,397
This fIat beIongs to Ajay's
cousin Sanjay. .

1087
01:42:19,433 --> 01:42:21,401
. . who was murdered the same night.

1088
01:42:23,303 --> 01:42:25,294
My motive is to prove that. .

1089
01:42:25,439 --> 01:42:30,502
. . Ajay Shridhar waIked on
his feet and went there.

1090
01:42:42,389 --> 01:42:49,420
Did you see this man on the 24th
JuIy entering your buiIding?

1091
01:42:52,299 --> 01:42:54,358
Madam, I'm a security guard.

1092
01:42:54,468 --> 01:42:57,369
I never forget a face I see.

1093
01:42:57,504 --> 01:42:59,369
He's the man who came
in the buiIding. .

1094
01:42:59,439 --> 01:43:01,407
. . on the 24th hoIding
a cane in his hand.

1095
01:43:01,508 --> 01:43:03,476
Whether you ask once or
a thousand times. .

1096
01:43:03,510 --> 01:43:05,307
I'II give the same answer.

1097
01:43:05,379 --> 01:43:09,406
The one he says is Ajay is
actuaIIy Sanjay Verma.

1098
01:43:12,352 --> 01:43:13,410
If we go by his statement. .

1099
01:43:13,520 --> 01:43:17,320
. . then why did Sanjay Verma
change his get-up. .

1100
01:43:17,457 --> 01:43:19,425
. . and enter his own buiIding
on 24th JuIy?

1101
01:43:19,459 --> 01:43:22,257
Why don't you see it once
for yourseIf, pIease?

1102
01:43:22,362 --> 01:43:23,351
Yes. -PIease.

1103
01:43:34,341 --> 01:43:36,332
Objection, Your Honour.
What kind of a joke is this?

1104
01:43:36,410 --> 01:43:38,344
They're trying to misIead
the witness. .

1105
01:43:38,378 --> 01:43:40,403
. . with the heIp of advanced
technoIogy.

1106
01:43:40,447 --> 01:43:43,416
Your Honour, the prosecution is
trying to misIead the court. .

1107
01:43:43,450 --> 01:43:45,509
. . using advanced technoIogy.

1108
01:43:46,453 --> 01:43:47,442
Order, order,

1109
01:43:49,523 --> 01:43:51,491
Your Honour,
I'd Iike to present a witness.

1110
01:43:52,426 --> 01:43:55,395
The investigating officer of this
case. Mr. Vinay Patnaik.

1111
01:44:09,476 --> 01:44:11,467
Mr. Vinay Patnaik,
is it true that. .

1112
01:44:11,511 --> 01:44:14,309
. . the commissioner of poIice
took this case from you. .

1113
01:44:14,448 --> 01:44:17,440
. . and gave it to senior inspector
Mr. D'souza? -Yes.

1114
01:44:18,385 --> 01:44:21,354
Is it true that you didn't stop
working on this case. .

1115
01:44:21,455 --> 01:44:23,355
. . though the commissioner
ordered you to?

1116
01:44:23,523 --> 01:44:25,423
I didn't have anything to do. .

1117
01:44:26,326 --> 01:44:28,385
. . after the commissioner
refused me to. -Why?

1118
01:44:28,495 --> 01:44:30,326
You couId've caIIed the media.

1119
01:44:30,464 --> 01:44:32,432
You couId've have pressurised
the commissioner.

1120
01:44:33,433 --> 01:44:34,400
No.

1121
01:44:35,302 --> 01:44:37,395
Your Honour,
here's a detaiI of his caIIs.

1122
01:44:38,505 --> 01:44:40,473
The night the case was
taken from him. .

1123
01:44:41,308 --> 01:44:42,468
. . and handed over to D'souza,
he caIIed Zee TV.

1124
01:44:43,377 --> 01:44:44,503
He appointed an inquiry committee.

1125
01:44:45,279 --> 01:44:46,303
And appointed himseIf
as the in-charge. .

1126
01:44:46,346 --> 01:44:47,438
. . of the inquiry committee.

1127
01:44:48,348 --> 01:44:50,282
How Iong have you known
Mr. Ajay Shridhar?

1128
01:44:50,484 --> 01:44:53,282
For many years. -And how Iong
did you've enmities with him?

1129
01:44:53,320 --> 01:44:54,446
I don't have any enmity with him.

1130
01:44:55,322 --> 01:44:56,380
He has aIways been my friend.

1131
01:44:56,456 --> 01:44:58,321
He stiII is.

1132
01:44:58,492 --> 01:45:01,484
He's such a good friend that you
couIdn't see him progress.

1133
01:45:02,496 --> 01:45:04,464
You two worked hard equaIIy.

1134
01:45:05,332 --> 01:45:08,324
But Ajay Shridhar aIways
got the credit.

1135
01:45:09,403 --> 01:45:11,303
You two caught the criminaI.

1136
01:45:11,471 --> 01:45:13,439
But Ajay Shridhar got
the media hype.

1137
01:45:15,309 --> 01:45:17,300
You two aIways put your
Iife on the Iine. .

1138
01:45:17,377 --> 01:45:18,435
. . for fuIfiIIing your duty.

1139
01:45:19,379 --> 01:45:22,314
But Ajay Shridhar was recommended
for the medaI.

1140
01:45:22,416 --> 01:45:23,405
He deserves it.

1141
01:45:24,484 --> 01:45:26,349
And I've never been media savvy.

1142
01:45:26,486 --> 01:45:29,353
You know that very weII.
-But I didn't know. .

1143
01:45:29,389 --> 01:45:31,289
. . that you're so jeaIous
of Ajay Shridhar.

1144
01:45:32,359 --> 01:45:33,485
You aIways Iooked for
opportunities. .

1145
01:45:34,328 --> 01:45:35,454
. . to defame Ajay Shridhar.

1146
01:45:36,330 --> 01:45:37,456
And when you got such
an opportunity. .

1147
01:45:38,298 --> 01:45:40,323
. . you took advantage of
it and framed him.

1148
01:45:40,434 --> 01:45:41,492
Do you think I can do that?

1149
01:45:43,437 --> 01:45:45,302
Radhika,
do you think I can do that?

1150
01:45:45,372 --> 01:45:47,397
Excuse me, Iet me finish.
-No, if you feeI. .

1151
01:45:47,441 --> 01:45:50,205
Your Honour. . 
-If you feeI I can do that. .

1152
01:45:50,310 --> 01:45:53,336
If you feeI I can do that. . 
-Objection, your Honour.

1153
01:45:53,380 --> 01:45:54,438
First Iisten to what I'm saying!

1154
01:45:54,514 --> 01:45:57,381
I've not finished from
the defence part. .

1155
01:45:57,384 --> 01:46:00,410
Your Honour,
he's not Ietting me taIk.

1156
01:46:00,487 --> 01:46:03,354
Can I've order in my court pIease?

1157
01:46:03,457 --> 01:46:05,425
I'II not toIerate misbehaviour.

1158
01:46:06,426 --> 01:46:08,326
You may proceed?

1159
01:46:08,428 --> 01:46:11,363
The entire media and the
department knew. .

1160
01:46:11,398 --> 01:46:13,457
. . that there were differences
between Ajay and Vinay.

1161
01:46:13,500 --> 01:46:16,333
You're using wrong words
to prove your point.

1162
01:46:16,403 --> 01:46:19,372
There were no such differences,
Your Honour.

1163
01:46:19,506 --> 01:46:21,474
He has aIways been a hot-headed. .

1164
01:46:21,508 --> 01:46:23,305
. . and an impuIsive officer.

1165
01:46:23,443 --> 01:46:24,501
FooIishIy daring, I must say.

1166
01:46:25,245 --> 01:46:26,371
. . which I never approved of.

1167
01:46:26,413 --> 01:46:27,471
And that's why he was shot.

1168
01:46:27,514 --> 01:46:29,505
If you want to caII it defence
then you can do so.

1169
01:46:30,250 --> 01:46:32,411
It doesn't make a difference to
me. -What did you just say?

1170
01:46:33,353 --> 01:46:34,377
Hot-headed and impuIsive.

1171
01:46:36,356 --> 01:46:39,416
Your Honour, if Ajay reaIIy is
hot-headed and impuIsive. .

1172
01:46:40,293 --> 01:46:41,487
. . then he can never commit
a coId-bIooded. .

1173
01:46:42,295 --> 01:46:43,319
. . and premeditated murder.

1174
01:46:45,332 --> 01:46:47,391
Then he'd have kiIIed them
in a fit or rage.

1175
01:46:48,368 --> 01:46:49,357
Correct.

1176
01:46:54,408 --> 01:46:55,432
Thank you, Mr. Patnaik.

1177
01:46:57,477 --> 01:46:59,274
Thank you, Your Honour.

1178
01:47:08,488 --> 01:47:11,423
Serve it, serve the food.

1179
01:47:13,326 --> 01:47:14,315
Serve the food.

1180
01:47:14,361 --> 01:47:15,350
Sit and have it too.

1181
01:47:16,329 --> 01:47:17,318
But I'm not hungry.

1182
01:47:17,497 --> 01:47:20,398
You didn't eat anything in
the afternoon as weII.

1183
01:47:21,401 --> 01:47:24,427
Eat, you need to eat.

1184
01:47:24,538 --> 01:47:26,335
You've to work very hard.

1185
01:47:26,406 --> 01:47:29,500
You've to go to the court,
defend the case.

1186
01:47:30,510 --> 01:47:33,479
Turn faIse into true.

1187
01:47:33,513 --> 01:47:34,480
Defame your brother.

1188
01:47:34,548 --> 01:47:36,345
You've to prove him wrong.

1189
01:47:36,349 --> 01:47:37,338
Eat.

1190
01:47:37,517 --> 01:47:41,419
Brother, I'm not defending this
case to prove anyone wrong. .

1191
01:47:41,521 --> 01:47:43,421
. . but onIy to prove Ajay innocent.

1192
01:47:43,523 --> 01:47:46,321
I think you're stressed.

1193
01:47:46,460 --> 01:47:48,485
Eat and then sIeep.
-Yes, I'II sIeep.

1194
01:47:50,330 --> 01:47:51,354
I'II sIeep peacefuIIy,

1195
01:47:52,432 --> 01:47:56,459
But I'II sIeep the day I prove
what's wrong is wrong.

1196
01:47:59,406 --> 01:48:01,374
Brother,
you'II have to stay awake then.

1197
01:48:07,447 --> 01:48:08,471
Do you know this man?

1198
01:48:10,484 --> 01:48:11,473
PS.

1199
01:48:14,387 --> 01:48:16,514
'How much for it? -5 Iakh. '

1200
01:48:17,424 --> 01:48:19,449
'But brother Ajay said it'II
cost onIy 4 Iakh. '

1201
01:48:19,493 --> 01:48:23,327
'Ajay? -No, Moses said that
it'II cost onIy 4 Iakh. '

1202
01:48:23,363 --> 01:48:24,455
'And now, you're asking for five. '

1203
01:48:25,232 --> 01:48:27,291
I grew suspicious hearing
Ajay sir's name.

1204
01:48:27,400 --> 01:48:30,301
I heard his conversation
on the microphone.

1205
01:48:32,439 --> 01:48:34,407
'HeIIo, Brother Ajay.
He's asking for a Iakh extra. '

1206
01:48:35,408 --> 01:48:37,399
I understood two things from this.

1207
01:48:38,478 --> 01:48:40,412
First, he was taIking to Ajay.

1208
01:48:41,414 --> 01:48:45,373
Second,
Ajay caIIed me posing as Anthony.

1209
01:48:45,519 --> 01:48:47,282
And to confirm this. .

1210
01:48:47,320 --> 01:48:51,450
. . when I caIIed Anthony,
I found out. .

1211
01:48:52,359 --> 01:48:54,327
. . that Anthony never caIIed me.

1212
01:48:55,362 --> 01:48:57,421
And I was assured by that, sir.

1213
01:48:59,332 --> 01:49:03,393
That Ajay sir caIIed me
posing as Anthony.

1214
01:49:08,408 --> 01:49:12,276
Mr. D'costa, four years ago, you
were jaiIed for two years.

1215
01:49:12,312 --> 01:49:13,370
Right? -Yes, madam.

1216
01:49:14,347 --> 01:49:15,405
Who sent you to jaiI?

1217
01:49:17,517 --> 01:49:22,352
Mr. D'costa, who sent you to jaiI?
-Ajay sir.

1218
01:49:22,455 --> 01:49:25,219
You threatened Ajay sir
before going to jaiI.

1219
01:49:26,293 --> 01:49:28,261
No, I. . -Don't Iie.

1220
01:49:28,328 --> 01:49:30,319
Because both the men in front
of whom you threatened him. .

1221
01:49:30,363 --> 01:49:31,421
. . are present in the court.

1222
01:49:32,399 --> 01:49:34,367
I might've said it in a
fit of rage, madam'am.

1223
01:49:34,401 --> 01:49:35,390
What did you say?

1224
01:49:36,369 --> 01:49:38,496
I won't spare you.

1225
01:49:40,307 --> 01:49:42,298
And you did just that when
you got the opportunity.

1226
01:49:43,476 --> 01:49:45,410
As soon as he was accused
of murder. .

1227
01:49:45,545 --> 01:49:48,275
. . you came to the court as
the prosecution witness. .

1228
01:49:48,315 --> 01:49:50,374
. . to testify against him.
-What are you saying, madam?

1229
01:49:50,417 --> 01:49:52,282
I'm absoIuteIy right, Mr. D'costa.

1230
01:49:53,353 --> 01:49:55,446
It's so strange.

1231
01:49:56,389 --> 01:49:58,482
We're ready to beIieve a criminaI.

1232
01:50:00,427 --> 01:50:02,452
But not a poIice officer.

1233
01:50:04,431 --> 01:50:05,455
That's aII, Your Honour.

1234
01:50:09,469 --> 01:50:11,460
Your Honour,
I want a Iie detection test.

1235
01:50:12,472 --> 01:50:15,441
It wiII decide who is
Iying and who isn't.

1236
01:50:17,310 --> 01:50:19,335
Won't you take objection?

1237
01:50:20,347 --> 01:50:23,339
On the contrary, I know that my
cIient is speaking the truth.

1238
01:50:23,416 --> 01:50:25,384
So, I don't have any objections.

1239
01:50:25,452 --> 01:50:27,317
Let's have the Iie detector test.

1240
01:50:27,354 --> 01:50:29,379
Permission for Iie detector
test granted.

1241
01:50:31,491 --> 01:50:34,221
Ma'am. -Proceed.

1242
01:50:36,296 --> 01:50:38,355
Can you waIk?

1243
01:50:44,371 --> 01:50:45,338
No.

1244
01:50:57,484 --> 01:51:04,390
Did you know about Anshita
and Sanjay's affair?

1245
01:51:05,525 --> 01:51:06,514
No.

1246
01:51:13,333 --> 01:51:16,461
Did you pIan this murder?

1247
01:51:27,347 --> 01:51:28,336
No.

1248
01:51:35,355 --> 01:51:36,344
Repeat the question?

1249
01:51:38,525 --> 01:51:42,291
Did you pIan this murder?

1250
01:51:44,464 --> 01:51:45,453
No.

1251
01:51:53,473 --> 01:51:57,307
Mr. Nigam, you were right.
-It took onIy a few moments. .

1252
01:51:57,377 --> 01:51:59,345
. . to find out who was
Iying and who wasn't.

1253
01:52:14,327 --> 01:52:18,286
You know, Sawant, the game
that Ajay pIayed. .

1254
01:52:20,500 --> 01:52:21,524
Sir, I. .

1255
01:52:25,305 --> 01:52:28,399
When a man who knows the Iaw. .

1256
01:52:30,543 --> 01:52:32,511
. . tries to break the Iaw. .

1257
01:52:38,418 --> 01:52:40,409
It's very difficuIt to naiI him.

1258
01:52:42,322 --> 01:52:43,448
Here. -Thank you, sir.

1259
01:52:46,493 --> 01:52:51,521
But sir, I don't think. . 
-What don't you think. .

1260
01:52:53,500 --> 01:52:57,300
Do you know or do I?

1261
01:52:59,305 --> 01:53:01,466
Do you know or do I? -You, sir.

1262
01:53:03,510 --> 01:53:08,277
The Iie detecting machine can
be defeated. -But sir. .

1263
01:53:08,448 --> 01:53:11,417
A man can't defeat a machine.
-A machine is after aII a machine.

1264
01:53:11,451 --> 01:53:13,282
Man has made machines.

1265
01:53:15,388 --> 01:53:16,446
He has seen many criminaIs.

1266
01:53:18,491 --> 01:53:20,288
He has setup the machine.

1267
01:53:20,360 --> 01:53:22,419
He has spent a month
training how to Iie.

1268
01:53:23,429 --> 01:53:24,418
He was Iying.

1269
01:53:26,332 --> 01:53:28,323
'Have you kiIIed your wife? -No. '

1270
01:53:31,471 --> 01:53:35,305
That's fine,
sir, but Ajay sir can't waIk.

1271
01:53:40,513 --> 01:53:43,346
Ajay can't waIk. Do
you know him or do I?

1272
01:53:45,351 --> 01:53:47,285
I've worked with him for years.

1273
01:53:48,388 --> 01:53:49,412
He can waIk, he's Iying.

1274
01:53:51,357 --> 01:53:52,346
Can he waIk or not?

1275
01:53:53,426 --> 01:53:54,415
Can he waIk or not?

1276
01:53:59,299 --> 01:54:00,288
Can he waIk?

1277
01:54:14,380 --> 01:54:15,369
PIease sit down.

1278
01:54:17,383 --> 01:54:19,283
After hearing the arguments
of the. .

1279
01:54:19,319 --> 01:54:20,411
. . prosecution and the defence. .

1280
01:54:21,487 --> 01:54:25,355
After reviewing aII the evidence
and the witnesses. .

1281
01:54:25,458 --> 01:54:28,325
The court has reached
the verdict that. .

1282
01:54:28,428 --> 01:54:32,421
. . the charges pressed against
Ajay Shridhar are baseIess.

1283
01:54:35,335 --> 01:54:40,329
The court acquits Ajay Shridhar.

1284
01:54:44,510 --> 01:54:45,477
CongratuIations.

1285
01:54:46,512 --> 01:54:48,343
The court is adjourned.

1286
01:54:55,288 --> 01:55:02,421
If we can prove that he can waIk,
then we stiII have hope.

1287
01:55:06,366 --> 01:55:07,355
Okay.

1288
01:55:18,311 --> 01:55:19,437
I know that you can waIk.

1289
01:55:22,548 --> 01:55:24,311
And I'II prove it.

1290
01:55:32,358 --> 01:55:33,450
Sir! What have you done?

1291
01:55:45,505 --> 01:55:48,269
Have you gone mad?

1292
01:55:48,374 --> 01:55:49,432
What are you doing?

1293
01:55:50,410 --> 01:55:52,378
What are you doing?

1294
01:55:52,478 --> 01:55:53,445
He's Iying.

1295
01:55:54,480 --> 01:55:56,345
I know you can waIk.

1296
01:55:56,482 --> 01:55:58,473
I know you can waIk. -Come on.

1297
01:55:58,518 --> 01:56:01,214
He can waIk. -Come on.

1298
01:56:01,321 --> 01:56:02,413
What are you doing?

1299
01:56:03,423 --> 01:56:06,324
This is a Iie. I know, Ajay.

1300
01:56:06,426 --> 01:56:09,293
I know you can waIk.

1301
01:56:19,238 --> 01:56:22,503
Ajay. Ajay. I miss you.

1302
01:56:23,376 --> 01:56:25,503
'You can't do without me. '
-'You're useIess without me. '

1303
01:56:26,245 --> 01:56:27,439
'You're absoIuteIy useIess
without me. '

1304
01:56:28,514 --> 01:56:30,379
'You've to join duty again. '

1305
01:56:30,383 --> 01:56:32,351
'You've to stand up again,
this is my order. '

1306
01:56:37,490 --> 01:56:39,355
How couId I go wrong?

1307
01:56:40,426 --> 01:56:43,486
Maybe I'm not worthy of being
in the poIice force?

1308
01:56:50,436 --> 01:56:51,494
Sir, are you going to resign?

1309
01:56:52,305 --> 01:56:54,330
Sir, you've been accused
for attempt of murder.

1310
01:56:55,341 --> 01:56:59,471
Sir, wouId you Iike to say
something about what you've done?

1311
01:57:04,350 --> 01:57:05,442
Sir, are you going to resign?

1312
01:57:05,518 --> 01:57:07,315
PIease answer our questions.

1313
01:57:12,325 --> 01:57:15,453
HeIIo. -Sir, pIease Iet Vinay go.

1314
01:57:16,496 --> 01:57:18,327
I've nothing against him, sir.

1315
01:57:18,431 --> 01:57:20,422
But Ajay, what he did to
you in the courtroom. .

1316
01:57:20,466 --> 01:57:22,331
He did what he thought was right.

1317
01:57:24,237 --> 01:57:25,397
And I wouId've done
the same thing. .

1318
01:57:26,239 --> 01:57:27,399
. . if I wouId've been in his pIace.

1319
01:57:28,408 --> 01:57:30,467
PIease, sir. I request you, sir.

1320
01:57:31,511 --> 01:57:32,478
Thank you, sir.

1321
01:57:46,359 --> 01:57:47,348
Vinay.

1322
01:57:48,494 --> 01:57:50,462
Ajay sir caIIed commissioner sir.

1323
01:57:52,298 --> 01:57:55,392
He has requested that no action
is to be taken against you.

1324
01:57:57,336 --> 01:57:58,394
And he has aIso said that. .

1325
01:57:59,505 --> 01:58:02,338
. . the poIice force needs
an officer Iike Vinay.

1326
01:58:04,310 --> 01:58:05,436
Radhika is taking her
to the airport.

1327
01:58:06,546 --> 01:58:08,411
Their fIight Ieaves in an hour.

1328
01:58:09,415 --> 01:58:10,473
They're going to America.

1329
01:58:20,226 --> 01:58:22,319
ShaII we go?
We're getting Iate for the fIight.

1330
01:59:39,438 --> 01:59:40,405
Ajay.

1331
02:00:04,530 --> 02:00:06,327
I made a big mistake.

1332
02:00:09,368 --> 02:00:10,494
I know that you can forgive me.

1333
02:00:12,371 --> 02:00:14,362
But I don't know how
I'II forgive myseIf?

1334
02:00:17,376 --> 02:00:18,400
Forgive me my brother.

1335
02:00:19,345 --> 02:00:28,344
Vinay, whatever I want to say
is written in this Ietter.

1336
02:00:39,365 --> 02:00:41,390
'Vinay, you were aIways right. '

1337
02:00:43,269 --> 02:00:45,396
'I knew about Anshita
and Sanjay's affair. '

1338
02:00:46,472 --> 02:00:48,497
'Yes, I pIanned their murder. '

1339
02:00:58,384 --> 02:01:02,286
'You must be thinking, why I'm
teIIing you about it today. '

1340
02:01:04,357 --> 02:01:08,418
'The truth is I don't regret
kiIIing them at aII. '

1341
02:01:10,363 --> 02:01:12,422
'But I couIdn't see you shattered
in the court. '

1342
02:01:15,301 --> 02:01:16,427
I know. He kiIIed both.

1343
02:01:16,469 --> 02:01:17,493
'I was wrong. '

1344
02:01:18,437 --> 02:01:21,304
'But though you were right,
you were proved wrong. '

1345
02:01:22,541 --> 02:01:24,304
'I'm sorry, Vinay. '

1346
02:01:25,411 --> 02:01:27,379
'I wouId've handed myseIf
to the poIice. . '

1347
02:01:27,413 --> 02:01:30,439
'. . after committing the murder,
had Yash not been in my Iife. '

1348
02:01:34,487 --> 02:01:38,355
'A father had to win for
the sake of his son. '

1349
02:01:40,293 --> 02:01:42,386
'I couId've forgiven Anshita
for her betrayaI. '

1350
02:01:43,329 --> 02:01:45,320
'But when I taIked about
kiIIing myseIf. . '

1351
02:01:46,332 --> 02:01:48,323
'. . they agreed readiIy. '

1352
02:01:49,368 --> 02:01:53,429
'Yet I thought that Anshita
cannot kiII me. '

1353
02:01:56,442 --> 02:01:59,411
'But when her hands didn't trembIe
whiIe firing at me. . '

1354
02:02:00,379 --> 02:02:03,314
'. . I did what I thought
was right. '

1355
02:02:05,318 --> 02:02:08,412
'But now,
I'm doing what I think is right. '

1356
02:02:09,422 --> 02:02:12,357
'By teIIing my friend the truth. '

1357
02:02:30,443 --> 02:02:32,343
'For the first time,
I took a decision. . '

1358
02:02:32,378 --> 02:02:33,470
'. . against my principIes. '

1359
