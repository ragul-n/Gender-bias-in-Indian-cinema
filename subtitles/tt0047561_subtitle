3
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:26,830
Madam, your handkerchief.

4
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:30,150
- And happy hunting.
- Rascal.

5
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:33,990
Isn't it time you went for your kill?

6
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:36,880
What's bothering you?
You've been gone for four days.

7
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:38,230
Found someone else?

8
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,800
Get lost.

9
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,660
How about tonight?

10
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,750
- How much?
- Allow me.

11
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:55,770
- It's one and the same.
- This will end in an altercation.

12
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:59,450
- Suit yourself.
- Please proceed.

13
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:05,760
- My life is in your hands.
- Son of a gun.

14
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:14,220
- Picked the wallet, did you?
- He's worth a hundred, I swear.

15
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:18,590
- Get lost, then.
- Keep the change.

16
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:04,740
- What's the hassle?
- What's your problem?

17
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:08,740
Hero, in the nick of time.
Go on, take my passenger.

18
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:12,210
Take my car. Please change over.

19
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:27,270
Listen, unless you know how to
fix cars, you don't get to drive.

20
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,480
Do it for me, will you?

21
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,960
Ratan Lal? The music director?

22
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,660
He left last year. Here's his address.

23
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:44,480
- How far is this place?
- Eight, maybe ten miles.

24
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:49,920
- Ten miles away? Some other city?
- New in Bombay? Take a taxi.

25
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:56,176
- I want Ratan Lal to score good music.
- As a music director, he better.

26
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,700
Let's go and see him.

27
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:03,420
Are you going to see Ratan Lal?
Take this girl along too.

28
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,240
Fine. Come along.

29
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:14,870
We'll take a taxi.

30
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,640
- Taxi, let's go. - Where to?
- Juhu. - How much are you paying?

31
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:35,690
What do you mean?
Aren't you running on the meter?

32
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,420
Engaged.

33
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:45,340
- Well, how much?
- Find another cab.

34
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:47,750
- There are no cabs around.
- I'm not going.

35
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:51,120
Stop playing hard to get.
Just say, how much.

36
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:56,590
- Fifteen rupees.
- All right. Move it.

37
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,960
Suckers and suckers.

38
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:17,190
- What did you say?
- Nothing.

39
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:09,140
- But there's no house out here.
- The house is behind the trees.

40
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:12,090
- Fifteen rupees.
- Wait. We'll be back soon.

41
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:15,850
- The fare please.
- I told you. We'll be back.

42
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:18,830
- We didn't discuss the return fare.
- You can have five rupees more.

43
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:23,990
- How long will you take?
- An hour at most. Don't worry.

44
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:50,870
Let go. I'm not coming.

45
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,160
Go on. Hit him.

46
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:29,430
- Hey.
- Over here.

47
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:34,770
Sit in the cab.

48
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:38,490
No home?

49
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:41,160
New in Bombay?

50
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:45,720
Looking for someone? Who?

51
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:53,160
Don't cry. I'll drop you.
But tell me, where?

52
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:58,290
All right, sit in the cab
and cry your heart out.

53
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,220
Hurry up. The goons will be back.

54
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:36,110
The address.

55
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:41,770
- The goondas took all my money.
- Well then?

56
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:45,090
- How am I going to pay you?
- Well, how will you?

57
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:48,370
If he's at home,
I'll pay you right away.

58
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:53,890
- Who is this Ratan Lal?
- Music director.

59
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:57,650
A maternal uncle?

60
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,560
Paternal uncle? Father-in-law?

61
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,210
- Then?
- Not related.

62
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,190
"Not related" is dicey.

63
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:41,700
This is the building. Come on.

64
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,680
Looks like this is the house.

65
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:02,950
Anybody home?

66
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,300
What are you up to?

67
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,140
That isn't going to wake him up.

68
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:16,230
He's sound asleep.

69
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:21,380
Not enough to wake him up.

70
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:30,010
- You want something?
- You have visitors.

71
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:33,300
- Mr. Ratan Lal?
- Who's Ratan Lal?

72
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:35,630
- Doesn't he live here?
- What's the address?

73
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:38,980
- Gul Naaz Building #4.
- Number four?

74
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:41,670
Your turn, is it?

75
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,280
This is number four.

76
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,410
- What are you up to?
- Breaking the shoe in.

77
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:57,350
- Your have visitors.
- Whom are you visiting?

78
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:00,320
- Are you Mr. Ratan Lal?
- I'm Moti Lal.

79
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:04,880
- What Ratan Lal are you looking for?
- Ratan Lal, music director.

80
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:07,610
- He moved out long ago.
- Where to?

81
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:11,460
He could be anywhere in Bombay.
But he's surely in Bombay.

82
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,200
In Bombay?

83
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:25,140
She walks out on her parents.
She runs away to Bombay, for Ratan Lal?

84
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,540
- Something like that.
- And she fell among thieves?

85
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:32,670
- Go back home.
- My parents are dead.

86
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:37,390
My uncle was trying
to palm me off for the money.

87
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:42,430
- And how do you know Ratan Lal?
- He came to our village last year.

88
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,880
- He aprreciated my voice.
- Only voice?

89
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:50,420
He said, come to Bombay.
I'll give you a job. You'll make a name.

90
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:54,580
- What's your name?
- Mala.

91
00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:00,970
Nice name. I'm Mangal.
Friends call me Hero.

92
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:17,060
- We've been to three or four places. Now what?
- What am I to do?

93
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:24,030
Keys. To my pad. You sleep there.
I'll sleep in the cab.

94
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:26,530
- I can't do that.
- Stop arguing and move it.

95
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:37,300
- Your house?
- Just a room on rent.

96
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:41,470
I imagined you're rich, and
you have a house, servants...

97
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:44,376
- What made you think that?
- To own a motor car, you must be rich.

98
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:47,320
- This is just a taxi.
- A taxi is also a motor car.

99
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:52,070
A motor car is a rich man's slave.
A taxi is the poor cabbie's provider.

100
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:04,030
Come on in.

101
00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:09,149
That's where you sleep. If you're
hungry, try potluck. Bolt the door.

102
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:16,729
Hello Sylvie. You're late today.

103
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,510
The Hero's heart-throb.

104
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:29,450
For you, I could write poetry.

105
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:52,110
- You're very late, Sylvie.
- I went to The Taj.

106
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,070
I might land a job there.

107
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,630
Don't let Sylvie go to The Taj.

108
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:02,980
Just let me win at the races.
I'll make this place better than The Taj.

109
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:07,190
That's nonsense.
You haven't paid me in a month.

110
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:12,510
I'll double your wages
once I win at the races.

111
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:15,230
For Sylvie, I'll give anything,

112
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:18,990
D'Mello speaking.

113
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:22,640
Yes, how many times must I say?
That's my horse.

114
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:29,600
- Mr. D'Mello, you gave the tip away.
- This time I'm winning.

115
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:33,080
- That's what you always say.
- Howdy, Mr. D'Mello.

116
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:37,790
- Hi Hero. Where have you been?
- Get out of my nose.

117
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:43,680
- You stink.
- Who says I'm drunk?

118
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:48,596
Look, the bottle is so empty
that it sounds.

119
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:49,820
Get lost.

120
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:57,600
This bottle is an heirloom.

121
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:03,830
The magic of it being, just put
your finger in it, and then lick it.

122
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:05,930
So the forefathers licked it dry.

123
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:10,190
For me, the smell of it is kick enough.

124
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:11,490
Saved it.

125
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:29,870
How come he always
comes to the club drunk?

126
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:33,256
Who Mastana? No. I wouldn't
let him in if he's drunk.

127
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,190
He just looks drunk.

128
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,790
- That's why he's called Mastana.
- How could that be?

129
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:44,110
Even the cops picked him up once.

130
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:48,330
They learned he doesn't drink.
It's just a put-on.

131
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:53,330
Heady lifestyle, is it? Live it up.

132
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:18,310
Unite your heart with
another heart and fall in love

133
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:26,620
Make some pleasant commitment

134
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:39,680
Why should we be ashamed?
Why should we be scared?

135
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:44,090
Why should we die
before living our life?

136
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:58,316
Under the shade of the drape
and the colorful atmosphere...

137
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:02,120
make your life more beautiful

138
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:23,490
Springs come and Springs go

139
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:27,580
I've been waiting with
open arms for so long

140
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,946
I'm feeling intoxicated.
My life is saying that...

141
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:45,920
we should express
the desires of the heart

142
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:51,230
Unite your heart with another heart
and fall in love, love

143
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:54,300
Make some pleasant commitment

144
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:05,180
Remove the fear of disgrace
from your heart

145
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:09,210
Change your loneliness into heaven

146
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:23,200
The desires are fresh
and time is with is

147
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:27,220
So we should fill our hearts
with happiness, dear

148
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:32,230
Unite your heart with another heart
and fall in love, love

149
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:35,640
Make some pleasant commitment

150
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:50,760
- Get off it, Tony.
- Hey Hero...

151
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:54,110
Sorry, I forgot about your share.
Here's twenty.

152
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:59,450
- Keep it.
- I clipped a hundred off him.

153
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:04,620
Your share is 20.
Buy someone a drink.

154
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:07,300
You refuse? I'll give it to the taxi.

155
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,900
- A drink for the taxi?
- Why not?

156
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:14,650
- Hey, I want the taxi tonight.
- What for?

157
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:20,240
- What for? What do you think this is?
- Cash. What else?

158
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,770
And it's biting me.

159
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:27,140
I won't rest till I've got rid of it

160
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:30,406
- Then let it stay in my pocket.
- I have pockets, too.

161
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:35,050
But this money is ill-gotten.
Left to you, you're likely...

162
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:40,340
- to lose sleep over it, and I too.
- Then get lost.

163
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:46,840
- Hey listen, I want the taxi.
- All right, I'll do you this favor.

164
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:51,030
- How about dropping you home?
- I'd rather walk the empty streets.

165
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:53,550
I guess you deserve a lick at least.

166
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:58,140
Sweet. Let's go Tony.

167
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:14,800
Hey smart ass, get out.

168
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,440
- Who is it?
- Get up. It's your father.

169
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:21,830
- Where's daddy? - Up here. Get up.
- I thought the car was upside down.

170
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:24,290
Sorry, it was me.

171
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:30,340
Let me sleep a while longer.

172
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:33,940
Don't make me do it to you.

173
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:11,020
- What voice do I hear?
- Such a sweet voice.

174
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:18,420
- Must be a confectioner's daughter.
- And bitten by a honey bee?

175
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:25,120
But it's coming from your pad.

176
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:36,040
- The door is locked from the outside.
- Don't you see?

177
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:40,530
- Could it be a ghost?
- Just the radio.

178
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:42,870
- Radio?
- Yes.

179
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:47,480
Never mind, then. How about
standing me breakfast?

180
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:53,360
What happened to your eighty?
The money that was biting you.

181
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:58,060
Women are treacherous.

182
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:02,630
She sings one song for me,
and she takes all my eighty.

183
00:27:03,410 --> 00:27:05,370
That's what puts you off to sleep?

184
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:12,400
Take this, and get out of my face
for a couple of days.

185
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:34,680
- What was that? Singing practice?
- I was reciting the Ramayana.

186
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:38,840
- He told me, read it every morning.
- Who did? Ratan Lal? - Yes.

187
00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:41,650
- And where is he?
- I'm still looking.

188
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,000
Let's go.

189
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,740
Why do you put me in the
back seat like a servant?

190
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:53,640
Not like a servant. Like the boss.

191
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:55,950
It's so different out here.

192
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:01,110
- You're a wag.
- What's a wag?

193
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:04,320
You don't know? What do you know?

194
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:08,750
A wag is a wag.

195
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:53,890
Does one Mr. Ratan Lal live here?

196
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,520
What now?

197
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:56,060
Today you sleep in the room.
I'll sleep in the cab.

198
00:29:56,550 --> 00:30:01,730
Out here the goons will get you.
Go on, don't worry about me.

199
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:30,660
If my horse wins I'll spruce up this hotel,
like The Taj Mahal Hotel.

200
00:30:31,810 --> 00:30:35,250
Sylvie, my love. My diamond.

201
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:41,560
- Where's the Hero?
- That's what I want to know too.

202
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:46,890
- Want to know about me, my love?
- Think of the devil and here he is.

203
00:30:47,050 --> 00:30:51,700
- She's been pining away for you
- Hero, he's writing poetry about Sylvie.

204
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:59,900
- How about a reading?
- How could I write? Sylvie has no comparison.

205
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:16,120
- You won't ever change, will you?
- He sold his wife's jewelry.

206
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:19,320
- You don't deserve any mercy.
- He cheats at cards.

207
00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:22,076
No, he doesn't. I do. But he always wins.

208
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:25,580
- Get out of here.
- I've got to get back home.

209
00:31:27,810 --> 00:31:29,906
Were it not for the soft
spot I have for you...

210
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:33,250
- One more, please.
- Don't come back.

211
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,720
Soft spot.

212
00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:49,050
Try this.

213
00:31:50,690 --> 00:31:54,250
- He's the one. - He is.
- I've wanted him for so long.

214
00:31:56,230 --> 00:32:00,450
- Mastana, what do the dogs need?
- Bones.

215
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:03,800
Right.

216
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,860
Where's the girl?

217
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:29,230
Live and let live.
These are the days of youthfulness

218
00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:44,450
Where will you find
such atmosphere again?

219
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:52,590
These are the days to live

220
00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:56,410
Everyone has to die.
Try and enjoy life

221
00:32:56,610 --> 00:33:00,190
Try and enjoy
a few moments of love

222
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:29,040
The air and this weather
tell us to make merry

223
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:44,030
Choose some flower.
Have some dream

224
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:47,660
Change the destiny of your heart

225
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:51,510
Everyone has to die.
Try and enjoy life

226
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:55,350
Try and enjoy
a few moments of love

227
00:34:12,699 --> 00:34:20,699
This melodious life
is a beautiful song

228
00:34:31,949 --> 00:34:35,409
Don't bring grief into your life
my dear

229
00:34:35,790 --> 00:34:39,230
Because this is the world of happiness

230
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:11,330
Everyone has to die.
Try and enjoy life

231
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:14,900
Try and enjoy a few moments of love

232
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:34,500
Unwinded me.

233
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:40,860
- I'll size you up another day, son.
- Suit yourself.

234
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:47,220
What girl are you hiding?

235
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:49,500
It was the radio, was it?

236
00:35:51,290 --> 00:35:52,790
I want to know too.

237
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,820
- Why do you want to know?
- Who's the girl?

238
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:59,660
If you talk too much,
I'll teach you a lesson.

239
00:36:09,650 --> 00:36:11,220
Watch it, watch it.

240
00:36:18,830 --> 00:36:20,030
Let go.

241
00:36:33,010 --> 00:36:35,440
Take that. And go home.

242
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:43,840
Hero, come let me take
that weight off your chest.

243
00:36:59,270 --> 00:37:03,960
- What's this?
- The world goes around in circles.

244
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:15,130
- The world goes around in smoodles.
- Yes. But where's the money?

245
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:32,610
So that's why
the world is in such a mess.

246
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,840
Every day, this taxi...

247
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:47,560
goes out and here it comes back

248
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:59,020
Got it. Even the city
goes around in circles.

249
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:21,550
- Who have I in this wide world?
- No one at all - This taxi?

250
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:29,400
But no, not even this taxi,
once it runs out of gas.

251
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:35,270
I'm sick and tired to this thing.
I wish I could set it on fire.

252
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:41,290
- Give it to me. I'll set fire to it.
- You can have it.

253
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:45,870
May I? Thanks.

254
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:50,380
It hurts very badly.

255
00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:20,650
What's wrong with you?

256
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:25,580
What happened?

257
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:30,570
Your eyes are bloodshot. You're feverish.

258
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:35,880
Don't pin me down. Leave me.

259
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:39,110
What's it with you? Come, sit down.

260
00:39:54,330 --> 00:39:58,690
- You aren't scared of me?
- Of you?

261
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:10,320
- What if I carry you away?
- Where would you take me?

262
00:40:11,170 --> 00:40:12,670
I'm here. Home with you.

263
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:24,220
- You trust me so much?
- Even more.

264
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:29,320
- Why?
- God is kind. You're kind too.

265
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:35,310
No. I'm not like that.

266
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:39,550
I'm scum.

267
00:40:48,330 --> 00:40:49,730
Look into my eyes.

268
00:40:51,350 --> 00:40:52,550
They're red.

269
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:56,540
- And nothing else?
- Nothing else.

270
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:02,700
- Now tell me.
- What?

271
00:41:04,830 --> 00:41:07,450
I'm drunk. Drunk.

272
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:13,070
So you see who you're trusting?
I'm a drunk.

273
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:19,490
A goon. A hooligan. A taxi driver.

274
00:41:30,270 --> 00:41:33,960
- But why did you drink?
- Because I wanted to.

275
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:40,260
What are you doing?

276
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:48,820
Someone who can be screamed
at in the middle of the road.

277
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:53,280
Drive.

278
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:58,350
- Sorry, I'm not going.
- Why won't you?

279
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:01,800
- Then your daddy will drive me.
- I won't.

280
00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:11,710
I just drive a taxi. But who cares?

281
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:19,100
The one who pays me my fare, owns me.

282
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:22,990
But tell me, what isn't for hire?

283
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:33,820
And that woman spits it out. Taxi driver.

284
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:58,900
I said I'm sorry. Forgive me.

285
00:43:02,050 --> 00:43:06,390
I'm not a drunkard. I never drink.
I have a permit, but I save my money.

286
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,100
I told you, I won't drink again.

287
00:43:13,690 --> 00:43:16,900
Here's my permit. Do what you want.

288
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:22,950
That gets me a smile.
Come, I'll take you for a drive.

289
00:46:51,130 --> 00:46:53,540
- Tough times, man.
- Real tough.

290
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:03,010
Train coming in, Hero.

291
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:14,360
I hope I get a long distance passenger.

292
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:22,200
- Do you see what I see?
- What?

293
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:25,120
Your sister-in-law.

294
00:47:26,070 --> 00:47:29,280
- Goodness.
- Why are you scared?

295
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:34,260
- Take her home for me.
- But... - No questions.

296
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:01,710
- Sister-in-law, she's coming.
- Whose?

297
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:04,130
Mine. If she sees you, we're dead.

298
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:07,450
- Then?
- Think of something.

299
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:11,980
I hope she doesn't just barge in.

300
00:48:25,420 --> 00:48:28,130
- What are you doing?
- Making a man of you.

301
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:31,890
From now on, you're my cleaner.

302
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:40,140
What are you up to?

303
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:50,210
You cut my hair.

304
00:48:50,610 --> 00:48:53,010
If my sister-in-law walks in now,
you'll lose the rest of it.

305
00:48:55,730 --> 00:48:58,030
Put this on. I'll wait outside.

306
00:48:59,820 --> 00:49:04,690
Hack the hair. And put it on.
Make sure you look like a boy.

307
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:14,080
Hurry up.

308
00:50:00,030 --> 00:50:02,290
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

309
00:50:08,660 --> 00:50:12,690
Your name isn't Mala anymore.
Your name is...

310
00:50:13,770 --> 00:50:17,960
- Rajput. Why are you crying?
- My hair.

311
00:50:19,150 --> 00:50:21,750
- He loved it.
- Who? Ratan Lal?

312
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:37,880
What's your name? Not Mala, Rajput.

313
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:42,840
Let me see how you walk.

314
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:51,350
Not like that. Walk like a man. Nice.

315
00:50:55,330 --> 00:50:59,270
- Good. Do you know how to curse?
- No.

316
00:50:59,730 --> 00:51:02,010
Then you can't pass for a boy.
Go on. Use foul language.

317
00:51:03,510 --> 00:51:05,720
I hacked your hair.
Call me names.

318
00:51:08,070 --> 00:51:09,270
Go on.

319
00:51:15,150 --> 00:51:16,530
You're a sinner.

320
00:51:19,060 --> 00:51:20,810
Oh-so-loving.

321
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:26,030
Use something good and foul,
like damn, swine, asshole.

322
00:51:27,410 --> 00:51:28,610
Good God.

323
00:51:29,210 --> 00:51:35,740
- Every fifth word you speak is "damn".
- But that's swearing.

324
00:51:36,370 --> 00:51:38,990
Everything is expressed
in terms of damnation.

325
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:41,840
Proof that one is man enough.

326
00:51:45,540 --> 00:51:48,510
Like this damn bed, this damn
room, that damn window, damned Rajput.

327
00:51:48,590 --> 00:51:52,870
- Damn you, Hero.
- Bravo. Take a drag.

328
00:52:19,350 --> 00:52:21,800
Hello, sister-in-law.
When did you come?

329
00:52:21,870 --> 00:52:27,550
Nice to have you here. I missed you.
But why are you walking?

330
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:31,920
- Am I dead? - Never say that.
- Why didn't you take a cab for her?

331
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:04,670
- Rajput, this is my sister-in-law.
- God bless you, son.

332
00:53:04,860 --> 00:53:08,910
My new cleaner. Smart kid.

333
00:53:10,110 --> 00:53:13,980
- New cleaner? What about me?
- Enjoy your retirement.

334
00:53:14,350 --> 00:53:18,910
Polish the car. Then, buy
some groceries. Sister-in-law will cook.

335
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:30,440
- Do you know how to clean a car?
- Damn you. - How nice.

336
00:53:31,290 --> 00:53:33,900
I'm here for only a couple of days
to finalise this matter.

337
00:53:34,020 --> 00:53:38,720
- Finalise what? - Your marriage.
- Forget it, sister-in-law.

338
00:53:39,030 --> 00:53:43,040
- No way. Pack. You're coming with me.
- Sit down. I'll get your luggage.

339
00:53:52,090 --> 00:53:56,400
The matter is a bit delicate,
pertaining to my marriage, etc.

340
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:59,140
Get the group over over here,
and brief them.

341
00:54:01,310 --> 00:54:03,280
- Is that so?
- Hurry.

342
00:54:05,820 --> 00:54:07,630
- Should I take the car?
- Go on.

343
00:54:10,090 --> 00:54:13,540
You don't even know
how to clean a car.

344
00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:20,330
- Here, learn how to do it.
- Keep the spit for later.

345
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:23,770
Now sit in the car,
and see how she drives.

346
00:54:37,610 --> 00:54:41,240
- Where did you get this Ramayan?
- I've become religious.

347
00:54:41,930 --> 00:54:46,570
- Who taught you that?
- In the end it always works out.

348
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:56,940
So, it's about Hero's wedding?

349
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:04,950
- He's going to regret it.
- Cowards. Are you scared of women?

350
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:07,920
You don't yet know what a woman is.

351
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:13,590
- Grow up first. Here, take a drag.
- You're just a boy. You smoke?

352
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:16,440
I'm a man.

353
00:55:42,420 --> 00:55:45,740
New recruit. Hey, cleaner.

354
00:55:46,470 --> 00:55:49,710
Do you hear me?

355
00:55:51,670 --> 00:55:54,490
Clean it the way I showed you.

356
00:55:55,750 --> 00:55:57,140
That's the way.

357
00:55:58,430 --> 00:56:00,030
Now it shines. Come in.

358
00:56:07,990 --> 00:56:10,900
I heard your sister-in-law is in town...

359
00:56:11,140 --> 00:56:14,880
so I said to myself, why not meet her?

360
00:56:17,050 --> 00:56:19,020
Plain water? You should've
asked for a lemonade.

361
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:22,400
It's time he got married.
He's becoming a vagabond.

362
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:24,470
- Shut up.
- He's right.

363
00:56:24,550 --> 00:56:27,360
Find a good girl for him. Not like mine.

364
00:56:27,740 --> 00:56:31,280
Mine was a love marriage.
The wife turned out to be tramp.

365
00:56:31,990 --> 00:56:33,920
I trashed her. She walked out.

366
00:56:34,930 --> 00:56:38,110
There's a very good girl.
My younger sister.

367
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:42,720
Get him married as soon as
the lawsuit is resolved.

368
00:56:44,170 --> 00:56:45,270
Lawsuit?

369
00:56:45,450 --> 00:56:48,320
Mastana. You gave it away.

370
00:56:48,950 --> 00:56:52,530
- Tell me, what's this about?
- Nothing much.

371
00:56:52,590 --> 00:56:56,610
- I just beat up someone.
- Why did you have to fight?

372
00:56:57,380 --> 00:57:01,870
- Tell me, what happened?
- One day, I took three passengers...

373
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:06,030
two men, and a woman.
And they say drive, so I drove.

374
00:57:06,430 --> 00:57:11,550
Now listen to this carefully.
I'm driving fast.

375
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:18,100
I'm covering miles, and I tell myself
nice catch. I'll make a nice tip.

376
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:20,200
Then I ask, where do you want to go?

377
00:57:22,310 --> 00:57:25,200
No sooner do I ask, one of them
puts a knife to my neck...

378
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:31,610
and says, keep driving
or I'll stick you. That winded me.

379
00:57:33,850 --> 00:57:37,980
It was a dark stormy night.
And then it started raining.

380
00:57:38,460 --> 00:57:44,110
And there was thunder, lightning.
Suddenly I hear the woman screaming.

381
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:46,420
Help.

382
00:57:46,970 --> 00:57:50,130
They got off near a deserted hut,
and they began molesting her.

383
00:57:50,970 --> 00:57:56,680
I hit one of them. He fell down.
The other one stabbed me. Here.

384
00:57:57,600 --> 00:58:01,070
By the time I pulled the dagger out,
they had escaped.

385
00:58:02,700 --> 00:58:05,640
The girl was sobbing.
She was in bad shape.

386
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:09,620
I brought her back. I put her
up in a hotel, and the next day...

387
00:58:09,930 --> 00:58:13,520
I go there looking for her,
and who do I see? Her uncle.

388
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:17,760
Not one question asked,
and he slaps me on my face.

389
00:58:19,290 --> 00:58:22,790
Now that made me very angry.
I beat him back and blue.

390
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:27,330
The police arrived. And I'm framed.

391
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:32,240
- What's going to happen?
- Three months, maybe six.

392
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:36,390
- Jail?
- At least that long.

393
00:58:36,650 --> 00:58:39,840
Let's just get done with the wedding.

394
00:58:46,930 --> 00:58:52,170
Let the lawsuit be settled first.
And get out of this taxi business.

395
00:58:52,340 --> 00:58:56,410
- It's so dangerous.
- Never mind that. Drink the water.

396
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:05,910
Rajput, the luggage.

397
00:59:10,020 --> 00:59:13,820
- Put it on the berth above.
- Someone is sleeping on it.

398
00:59:16,730 --> 00:59:20,630
- Give my regards to my brother.
- I'll work on the wedding.

399
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:50,080
That wasn't the right thing
to do to your sister-in-law.

400
00:59:51,970 --> 00:59:56,210
That was a pack of lies.
Why did you have to lie?

401
00:59:56,560 --> 00:59:59,150
That makes me a liar, a scoundrel,
and a rogue, right?

402
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:02,690
I am what I am. But I won't
like to hear it from you.

403
01:00:05,970 --> 01:00:10,370
Crying already? What are you?
Boy or girl?

404
01:01:05,230 --> 01:01:10,220
You left after the fight,
and I couldn't sleep all night.

405
01:01:10,970 --> 01:01:13,480
- What's your angle?
- When are you coming?

406
01:01:14,670 --> 01:01:15,970
Try someone else.

407
01:01:23,060 --> 01:01:24,540
Just a casual acquaintance.

408
01:01:28,340 --> 01:01:32,010
She dances at the club.
She talks like that to everyone.

409
01:01:38,230 --> 01:01:43,080
No questions? Go on, ask.

410
01:01:45,140 --> 01:01:46,540
To hell with you.

411
01:01:48,930 --> 01:01:51,160
- She's just a tramp.
- Don't say that.

412
01:01:53,820 --> 01:01:54,920
Wag.

413
01:02:04,950 --> 01:02:08,220
Sylvie of the golden voice.
You are my...

414
01:02:08,450 --> 01:02:11,980
No. I'm the one who's mad about you.

415
01:02:12,030 --> 01:02:15,256
- How about a song?
- Sure. One song.

416
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:18,500
No. Only when Hero comes.

417
01:02:18,940 --> 01:02:21,570
So Hero means more to you
than all of us?

418
01:02:21,820 --> 01:02:24,780
What about all the
verses I've written about you?

419
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:30,200
- He must've found someone else.
- Possibly. - Jealous?

420
01:02:30,310 --> 01:02:33,650
Beauty is worth the jealousy.

421
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:42,840
- What's wrong with him?
- What are you lost in?

422
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:48,920
I've thought it over.
And I've decided to get married.

423
01:02:49,020 --> 01:02:52,630
- And there's a girl waiting for you?
- Who is it?

424
01:02:52,690 --> 01:02:56,130
The girl in the house across the street.

425
01:02:56,240 --> 01:03:00,450
- But she's lame in one leg.
- So what?

426
01:03:00,750 --> 01:03:05,910
Imagine marrying a girl
who has both her legs...

427
01:03:06,370 --> 01:03:09,630
and worrying that she might run away.

428
01:03:11,220 --> 01:03:16,650
Worse, if she breaks a leg you
end up taking her to the hospital.

429
01:03:17,130 --> 01:03:21,850
Then you end up spending a lot
of money on medicine and care.

430
01:03:22,110 --> 01:03:24,480
You're asking for trouble.

431
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:28,670
This one has broken a leg already.
A perfect specimen.

432
01:03:28,750 --> 01:03:32,120
- Say what? And what do you say?
- Makes sense. But her mother is evil.

433
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:34,720
- Whom are you marrying? The daughter, or the mother?
- The mother.

434
01:03:36,590 --> 01:03:38,390
Why are you laughing?

435
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:41,600
- You want to marry her mother?
- Did I say "mother"?

436
01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:45,240
That one needs to be fixed.

437
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:52,930
- How about a hand of rummy?
- You wanna get slapped? - I'm not playing.

438
01:03:53,040 --> 01:03:55,720
- My money is right inside my pocket. Look.
- Go and sit over there.

439
01:03:55,850 --> 01:03:59,750
- I'm just watching the show
- Don't you gamble. - Never.

440
01:04:15,330 --> 01:04:21,960
- How do I look?
- Why did you have to accost me in public?

441
01:04:22,840 --> 01:04:24,220
- Shouldn't I have?
- No.

442
01:04:25,460 --> 01:04:27,610
I see you and I don't talk to you?

443
01:04:28,140 --> 01:04:30,160
Not necessary. Not in public.

444
01:04:30,340 --> 01:04:32,490
Sylvie, Mummy calling.

445
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:41,620
- So, how are you?
- Fine.

446
01:04:43,820 --> 01:04:46,500
One tea. Special. For Hero.

447
01:04:47,790 --> 01:04:50,490
Sylvie will be singing here.
She won't go to The Taj.

448
01:04:51,130 --> 01:04:56,510
And I'm fixing this place up.
Make sure you come every day.

449
01:04:56,840 --> 01:04:59,350
You see, the point is Sylvie is
sticking around for your sake.

450
01:04:59,730 --> 01:05:02,110
And I'm running this club
for Sylvie's sake.

451
01:05:02,670 --> 01:05:04,520
Understood. Perfectly.

452
01:05:15,020 --> 01:05:18,050
- Are you upset?
- No, cheerful.

453
01:05:19,110 --> 01:05:21,050
Sylvie, listen.

454
01:05:22,340 --> 01:05:24,630
You and I aren't made for each other.

455
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:33,506
- He won again.
- You won't stop until...

456
01:05:33,530 --> 01:05:35,360
you've sold everything you have.

457
01:05:37,040 --> 01:05:38,340
Go to hell.

458
01:05:39,970 --> 01:05:46,050
Hero, there's a lot of cash
on the table. Come on, win it.

459
01:05:46,080 --> 01:05:47,980
No thank you. My taxi
still provides for me.

460
01:05:51,250 --> 01:05:52,850
I have something to tell you.

461
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:58,220
- Where's he going?
- Stop him.

462
01:06:06,150 --> 01:06:09,350
He's going away for real.
Ask him, why?

463
01:06:09,380 --> 01:06:10,580
A girl.

464
01:06:11,790 --> 01:06:14,230
- Try sniffing this.
- Get lost.

465
01:06:16,310 --> 01:06:18,010
- Where are you going now?
- To hell.

466
01:06:18,430 --> 01:06:20,890
I hear that's one nice place.
Hurry up. Pile in.

467
01:06:42,550 --> 01:06:44,920
I'm off to sleep. Take the
taxi if you want to go somewhere.

468
01:06:45,530 --> 01:06:51,390
At this hour? Let's party in your room.

469
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:54,510
- What party?
- We're all set up.

470
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:59,070
- Not in my room.
- Of course. In your room.

471
01:06:59,290 --> 01:07:00,500
Come back.

472
01:07:06,370 --> 01:07:07,870
You don't go in there.

473
01:07:08,260 --> 01:07:09,460
Get out.

474
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:22,020
Hey Rajput. Mala?

475
01:07:36,990 --> 01:07:39,830
Hero, I don't want to stand
between you and Sylvie.

476
01:07:40,690 --> 01:07:43,940
Anyway, I'm just a burden
on you. Good bye.

477
01:07:44,950 --> 01:07:49,380
The Ramayan is what I treasure.
Just keep it. Mala.

478
01:08:57,069 --> 01:08:58,369
Flat tire.

479
01:09:02,510 --> 01:09:03,810
Are you engaged?

480
01:09:07,210 --> 01:09:08,950
Mr Ratan Lal, please come.

481
01:09:11,819 --> 01:09:15,009
Put the luggage in the cab.
Fix the flat and get home.

482
01:09:17,649 --> 01:09:18,849
Ratan Lal?

483
01:09:35,840 --> 01:09:38,710
Mr. Ratan Lal, the recording
has gone off well.

484
01:09:38,939 --> 01:09:41,539
- The song is a hit.
- Maybe.

485
01:09:42,390 --> 01:09:48,440
- But I couldn't get the tenor I wanted.
- Yes, your singer, the girl Moti...

486
01:09:48,740 --> 01:09:51,650
- she couldn't deliver it.
- She couldn't possibly.

487
01:10:15,570 --> 01:10:17,270
This is how it should've been sung.

488
01:10:27,500 --> 01:10:32,430
There you are, my love.
I've been waiting for you.

489
01:10:32,720 --> 01:10:36,440
Where have you been all these days?
Hey, where are you going?

490
01:10:36,760 --> 01:10:42,690
Mr. D'Mello is missing you.
And that Sylvie, she's crying for you.

491
01:10:43,170 --> 01:10:46,560
And I've stopped sniffing my bottle.

492
01:10:46,720 --> 01:10:49,720
Why, what's the matter? You look lost.

493
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:53,110
- Come on. Let's go to the club.
- All right.

494
01:10:56,660 --> 01:11:04,020
D'Mello says that if Hero doesn't turn up,
Sylvie will quit her job.

495
01:11:04,280 --> 01:11:06,430
Poor D'Mello, what'll happen to him then?

496
01:11:11,870 --> 01:11:13,870
Hurry up Anton.

497
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:19,080
Make sure you come in
early tomorrow morning.

498
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:31,620
- Hello, my Hero. It's been so long.
- Closed? How about some tea?

499
01:11:31,830 --> 01:11:35,860
Anything and everything you want.
This club is yours.

500
01:11:36,530 --> 01:11:40,530
- Great. But where's the tea?
- Why do you want tea?

501
01:11:41,910 --> 01:11:45,380
- Listen, I'm taking the car.
- All right.

502
01:11:47,930 --> 01:11:53,970
You know Hero, Sylvie has
been morose for sometime now.

503
01:11:56,060 --> 01:11:57,560
She even said she'd leave.

504
01:11:58,180 --> 01:11:59,480
Get my point?

505
01:12:03,170 --> 01:12:04,770
Sit, I'll get tea for you.

506
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:25,890
- One more notice.
- What is it?

507
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:28,640
It's from the R.T.O. regarding taxes.
They'll confiscate my permit...

508
01:15:28,990 --> 01:15:32,210
- if I don't pay it in two days
- Why don't you pay up?

509
01:15:33,640 --> 01:15:39,600
- Will your daddy give me money?
- Did he tell you to roam around?

510
01:15:40,020 --> 01:15:44,430
- Rajput also ran away.
- What are you saying?

511
01:15:44,740 --> 01:15:48,510
- You must not have paid him, right?
- What are you saying?

512
01:15:52,540 --> 01:15:54,130
Set to wander, right?

513
01:16:07,200 --> 01:16:09,720
What's the matter Hero? You look sad.

514
01:16:10,540 --> 01:16:15,830
Can I help you?

515
01:16:16,430 --> 01:16:21,020
- Remember Rajput, the cleaner?
- Has he cleaned you out?

516
01:16:21,540 --> 01:16:23,810
- Yes, something is missing.
- What?

517
01:16:25,130 --> 01:16:27,580
Actually, he's a she.

518
01:16:32,190 --> 01:16:39,780
So that was your radio.
I suspected all along.

519
01:16:40,310 --> 01:16:47,830
- Forget her. You still have Sylvie.
- You won't understand, Mastana.

520
01:17:01,590 --> 01:17:07,140
Passenger, stop. Let's take a passenger.

521
01:17:41,790 --> 01:17:42,990
Very well.

522
01:17:48,870 --> 01:17:54,310
Darling, we wanted another nanny,
didn't we? She's here for the job.

523
01:18:15,310 --> 01:18:18,950
30 per month, food and shelter. Agreed?

524
01:18:19,930 --> 01:18:22,870
If I find fault with you, you're out.

525
01:18:25,860 --> 01:18:28,760
All my material possessions, gone.

526
01:18:29,370 --> 01:18:31,070
This fiver is the last one left.

527
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:40,580
Let's burn it. Beginning tomorrow,
no taxi either.

528
01:18:40,930 --> 01:18:45,690
In that case, let's do it
to the fiver right away.

529
01:18:46,020 --> 01:18:50,770
- But we can still taxi around?
- Sure. D'Mello's car.

530
01:18:51,660 --> 01:18:56,280
- D'Mello's car has had it today.
- This is one day he'll remember.

531
01:19:12,300 --> 01:19:16,570
- To hell with our sorrows.
- Hell with our sorrows? No.

532
01:19:17,680 --> 01:19:20,010
Sorrow.

533
01:19:21,680 --> 01:19:26,770
- Sorrow is a disease.
- What a line.

534
01:19:27,410 --> 01:19:32,050
A disease for people to live with.

535
01:19:34,990 --> 01:19:37,200
Dramatic.

536
01:19:40,410 --> 01:19:43,220
If you want peace...

537
01:19:48,330 --> 01:19:50,770
keep nothing.

538
01:19:51,650 --> 01:19:54,110
Let's shake hands over it.

539
01:19:56,160 --> 01:19:59,860
It doesn't matter if one is happy
and another hurls curses

540
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:03,660
Become carefree and
enjoy the days of your life

541
01:20:30,070 --> 01:20:33,910
If I create a commotion after drinking,
then put me behind bars

542
01:20:57,650 --> 01:21:01,230
Don't worry even if the merchants
increase their prices

543
01:21:05,330 --> 01:21:09,040
Keep eating food merrily
as long as they provide credit

544
01:21:20,550 --> 01:21:24,136
It doesn't matter if one is happy
and another hurls curses

545
01:21:24,160 --> 01:21:28,120
Become carefree and
enjoy the days of your life

546
01:21:29,990 --> 01:21:33,000
Oh God! Flat tire.

547
01:21:43,210 --> 01:21:44,510
Use the jack

548
01:21:47,240 --> 01:21:50,260
Spare tire. Tire. Pumping

549
01:21:59,880 --> 01:22:03,510
It doesn't matter if one is happy
and another hurls curses

550
01:22:03,550 --> 01:22:07,180
Become carefree and
enjoy the days of your life

551
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:11,070
The one that shares his food with you,
you sacrifice everything for him

552
01:22:14,750 --> 01:22:18,250
The stingy one,
disgrace him in front of everyone

553
01:22:29,250 --> 01:22:32,646
It doesn't matter if one is happy
and another hurls curses

554
01:22:32,670 --> 01:22:36,290
Become carefree and
enjoy the days of your life

555
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:52,300
Carefree, carefree.
Carefree, carefree

556
01:23:21,300 --> 01:23:23,330
Let me show you the rope trick.

557
01:23:24,130 --> 01:23:26,990
Here's your rope.
This is how I hold it.

558
01:23:27,630 --> 01:23:33,030
And now, I take a pair of
scissors and I cut it into two.

559
01:23:34,820 --> 01:23:36,016
Like that.

560
01:23:36,040 --> 01:23:39,660
Now I take the two ends,
and I tie them together.

561
01:23:40,270 --> 01:23:43,620
So we have two pieces of rope
held together by a knot.

562
01:23:44,120 --> 01:23:45,620
Now show me your hand.

563
01:23:45,850 --> 01:23:48,460
Don't worry, it's just a trick.

564
01:23:50,700 --> 01:23:58,700
Now a little chant,
and the rope is one piece.

565
01:24:03,220 --> 01:24:06,570
- You're a wonderful magician.
- No way.

566
01:24:06,730 --> 01:24:10,500
- You've worked a more magical spell on me.
- Leave me.

567
01:24:11,960 --> 01:24:14,370
- Well, magician?
- She was trying her magic on me.

568
01:24:15,010 --> 01:24:16,760
- Was she?
- Yes.

569
01:24:17,050 --> 01:24:18,750
- Now watch my magic.
- No.

570
01:24:39,970 --> 01:24:42,570
The next time you try magic,
I'll make you a cripple.

571
01:24:44,820 --> 01:24:46,020
And you.

572
01:24:48,160 --> 01:24:50,480
Here's your ten rupees. And out you go.

573
01:26:17,050 --> 01:26:18,350
Bash him up.

574
01:27:03,510 --> 01:27:05,620
- Let's fight to the end.
- Take off your shirt.

575
01:27:11,210 --> 01:27:12,410
He's scared.

576
01:27:22,170 --> 01:27:23,370
He ran.

577
01:27:28,220 --> 01:27:31,600
Rajput, are you?

578
01:27:31,850 --> 01:27:34,020
We know you're a girl.

579
01:28:43,760 --> 01:28:48,350
- Hero. I thought you'd never come.
- You were right.

580
01:28:48,750 --> 01:28:51,510
- But here you are.
- I don't know why I'm here.

581
01:28:52,200 --> 01:28:54,730
- Want a song?
- No.

582
01:29:13,810 --> 01:29:19,320
- Won again.
- That was the last piece of his wife's jewelry.

583
01:29:20,720 --> 01:29:23,900
Swine. I told you to mend your ways.

584
01:29:26,260 --> 01:29:29,290
- What do I do now, Hero?
- I have nothing on me.

585
01:29:29,800 --> 01:29:31,200
Check my pockets. Empty.

586
01:29:31,780 --> 01:29:34,540
Take it from me.
How about a hand?

587
01:29:35,950 --> 01:29:37,150
What say?

588
01:29:40,920 --> 01:29:44,320
- What say? The taxi is no more.
- Just sit down, partner.

589
01:29:51,890 --> 01:29:54,750
- Careful. He's sharp.
- But he's the Hero.

590
01:30:01,170 --> 01:30:02,270
Stop!

591
01:30:02,430 --> 01:30:04,510
- Hero, he deals dirty.
- What did you say?

592
01:30:04,600 --> 01:30:09,070
- You cheat.
- All right, you deal.

593
01:30:18,630 --> 01:30:20,130
Give him a whipping, man.

594
01:30:47,190 --> 01:30:52,730
- One more?
- Lose at the tables, win in love.

595
01:30:53,180 --> 01:30:56,550
And losers in love, win at the tables.

596
01:30:56,590 --> 01:30:59,840
- Get it?
- Leave love for later. First, this hand.

597
01:31:03,110 --> 01:31:05,470
Play Hero. Try your luck.

598
01:31:05,870 --> 01:31:09,280
My love, or this money?
Let's see what wins.

599
01:31:12,310 --> 01:31:14,100
- Deal?
- Deal.

600
01:31:43,410 --> 01:31:44,810
Ask for show, Hero.

601
01:32:47,100 --> 01:32:50,180
What love? Just pick up the money.

602
01:32:54,160 --> 01:32:59,730
- That was Hero playing.
- Hero, look I've caught your cleaner.

603
01:33:00,250 --> 01:33:01,350
Gambling.

604
01:33:05,130 --> 01:33:06,430
Hero, the money.

605
01:33:26,930 --> 01:33:32,150
You saw me drinking.
Now you've seen me gambling.

606
01:33:34,140 --> 01:33:38,490
But why did you leave?
Why did you leave me?

607
01:33:42,210 --> 01:33:43,510
I'm a wag.

608
01:33:45,120 --> 01:33:48,390
I did three jobs. I made twenty rupees.

609
01:33:50,240 --> 01:33:52,240
I went looking for you,
and I found Ratan Lal.

610
01:33:52,780 --> 01:33:53,880
Really?

611
01:33:56,530 --> 01:33:58,910
- Take me to him.
- I will.

612
01:34:00,440 --> 01:34:02,650
- Engaged!
- Move it!

613
01:34:04,290 --> 01:34:06,740
You think your father owns the taxi?

614
01:34:10,290 --> 01:34:11,590
Move it, son.

615
01:36:42,310 --> 01:36:43,610
No one move.

616
01:37:20,050 --> 01:37:22,910
I suspect someone.
I gave him a beating once.

617
01:37:23,390 --> 01:37:27,990
Find out who he is, where he lives.
Let me know what you find out.

618
01:37:38,240 --> 01:37:41,170
Have you told the police?
You're finished, both of you.

619
01:37:53,240 --> 01:37:56,390
- Change clothes. I'll be back.
- What's the matter? - No questions. Go.

620
01:38:05,790 --> 01:38:08,120
- Can I borrow your taxi?
- Sure.

621
01:38:08,680 --> 01:38:10,450
- What news of the heist?
- No news yet.

622
01:38:29,630 --> 01:38:34,400
It's been a long time since I saw
you dressed as a woman. Lovely.

623
01:38:35,480 --> 01:38:36,980
What a thing to say.

624
01:38:39,800 --> 01:38:41,200
Time we parted, Mala.

625
01:38:44,730 --> 01:38:46,430
I'll drop you at Ratan Lal's place.

626
01:38:56,490 --> 01:39:01,060
I read the Ramayan every morning.
I'll imagine hearing your voice.

627
01:39:01,710 --> 01:39:03,010
I'm not going.

628
01:39:04,780 --> 01:39:07,970
You must. With me,
you'll be in danger, too.

629
01:39:10,620 --> 01:39:12,180
I won't go. I won't.

630
01:39:13,720 --> 01:39:17,040
What a wag. No crying, now.

631
01:39:32,700 --> 01:39:36,470
- I don't wish to leave you.
- Don't be mad, Mala.

632
01:39:37,620 --> 01:39:39,120
Go on, try your luck.

633
01:39:40,190 --> 01:39:42,330
You have the looks. You have the voice.

634
01:39:43,280 --> 01:39:45,080
With Ratan Lal's help,
someday you'll sing.

635
01:39:45,940 --> 01:39:47,640
The whole country will hear you sing

636
01:39:48,700 --> 01:39:52,650
What a name you'll make.
And fame. And money

637
01:39:55,170 --> 01:39:59,230
- Then one day, I'll walk up to you and I'll ask, Taxi, Madam?
- No.

638
01:40:02,700 --> 01:40:04,180
Don't lose this chance.

639
01:40:21,370 --> 01:40:23,880
- Go on.
- No. - You must.

640
01:40:27,470 --> 01:40:32,030
There's Ratan Lal. isn't he the one?

641
01:40:33,650 --> 01:40:34,850
Come on.

642
01:40:50,410 --> 01:40:51,610
Greetings, sir.

643
01:40:54,030 --> 01:40:56,690
Maybe he doesn't recognize you.
Go on, talk to him.

644
01:41:00,120 --> 01:41:02,990
- Want me to call him?
- No. I'm not going.

645
01:41:07,080 --> 01:41:08,890
Mala. Listen to me.

646
01:41:13,330 --> 01:41:15,730
- What are you doing?
- I'm not going.

647
01:41:16,170 --> 01:41:19,830
I won't let you lose this opportunity.

648
01:41:20,350 --> 01:41:21,946
I've never asked you for anything.

649
01:41:21,970 --> 01:41:26,350
I'm sure he'll recognize your voice.
Sing Mala, sing for my sake.

650
01:41:26,650 --> 01:41:29,350
No. I won't sing.

651
01:41:30,150 --> 01:41:31,350
You will.

652
01:41:46,320 --> 01:41:51,870
Where oh where can I go?

653
01:41:57,300 --> 01:42:05,300
Who in this world understands
the stress of a broken heart?

654
01:42:41,550 --> 01:42:47,390
Oh, the departing one,
who has left me behind...

655
01:43:12,240 --> 01:43:17,830
I find it very hard to live without you.
I can't forget you

656
01:43:58,320 --> 01:44:04,370
With flames in my chest
and sighs in my breaths

657
01:44:04,530 --> 01:44:10,180
How can I cope with this life?

658
01:44:28,720 --> 01:44:34,360
My emotions have been drained

659
01:44:34,840 --> 01:44:38,120
Where oh where can I go?

660
01:44:38,840 --> 01:44:46,840
Who in this world understands
the stress of a broken heart?

661
01:44:59,450 --> 01:45:00,700
Fantastic!

662
01:45:00,940 --> 01:45:02,140
I'm coming.

663
01:45:05,180 --> 01:45:07,330
- Greetings.
- Mala, you?

664
01:45:08,020 --> 01:45:10,830
I didn't even recognize you,
but I heard your voice...

665
01:45:10,880 --> 01:45:13,980
and knew it must be Mala.
When did you come?

666
01:45:19,210 --> 01:45:20,610
What's the matter, Mala?

667
01:45:26,130 --> 01:45:27,830
Has he made off with your luggage?

668
01:45:28,930 --> 01:45:30,730
That's what all these
taxi drivers are like.

669
01:45:33,920 --> 01:45:35,520
Come, you must meet my wife.

670
01:46:16,480 --> 01:46:20,080
So you're the one.
You're always causing trouble here.

671
01:46:20,210 --> 01:46:21,880
No hooliganism here.

672
01:46:22,570 --> 01:46:24,470
- Where are you off to, Sylvie?
- Who are you?

673
01:46:24,620 --> 01:46:28,440
Forgotten me already?
I was about to clobber the taxi driver...

674
01:46:29,370 --> 01:46:31,200
when you knocked me out cold.

675
01:46:32,440 --> 01:46:33,640
What happened?

676
01:46:34,080 --> 01:46:39,490
I never saw that. Look, there
sits the wounded army of admirers.

677
01:46:39,680 --> 01:46:43,580
- If you want, you may enlist too.
- I'll be back.

678
01:46:44,080 --> 01:46:48,530
Enlisting? Welcome. Come here everyday.
Die for her, everyday.

679
01:46:51,240 --> 01:46:53,880
I'll be back soon, son.

680
01:46:54,720 --> 01:46:57,560
- What's your hurry?
- Don't you cross my path.

681
01:46:58,010 --> 01:47:00,410
If I ever see you here again,
I'll break your face.

682
01:47:01,560 --> 01:47:09,060
- Won it. - What?
- My horse. At number five.

683
01:47:09,160 --> 01:47:12,850
- What's the prize money?
- Lots and lots.

684
01:47:12,940 --> 01:47:16,720
Now I'll build a hotel even better than
The Taj Mahal. And Sylvie stays on.

685
01:47:24,440 --> 01:47:27,230
- I shot him.
- Ass. Who was that in there?

686
01:47:39,760 --> 01:47:42,240
- Boss, we have to talk.
- You're late.

687
01:47:42,670 --> 01:47:47,800
- The taxi driver escaped.
- Never mind.

688
01:47:48,910 --> 01:47:51,926
I suggest you pay him
to keep his mouth shut.

689
01:47:51,950 --> 01:47:56,870
- Right.
- Boss, if the police find out...

690
01:47:57,240 --> 01:48:00,640
- we'll have to leave Bombay.
- No way.

691
01:48:01,360 --> 01:48:06,250
Keep an eye on the taxi driver.
Go to Ratan Lal's house tomorrow.

692
01:48:06,500 --> 01:48:09,570
Tell seth Bhagwandas he can have
the money he needs for his film.

693
01:48:10,660 --> 01:48:15,570
On interest. Go on. Be careful.

694
01:48:35,800 --> 01:48:38,160
The other day, there was this
girl who came here in my taxi.

695
01:48:38,400 --> 01:48:41,050
She left her luggage behind.
Will you please call her?

696
01:48:41,560 --> 01:48:43,670
- I'll give it to her.
- Will you please call her?

697
01:48:43,780 --> 01:48:45,850
She can't come. I'll give it to her.

698
01:49:00,750 --> 01:49:03,400
Yes, the taxi driver.
Turns out to be a nice fellow.

699
01:49:03,610 --> 01:49:06,650
- He hasn't left, has he?
- He wanted to see you. I told him he can't. - Why?

700
01:49:38,880 --> 01:49:40,280
That's him, the robber.

701
01:49:44,770 --> 01:49:48,300
She's the girl we took to the beach.

702
01:49:48,900 --> 01:49:51,270
- I've seen her somewhere else too.
- Is there a mystery?

703
01:49:57,710 --> 01:50:01,520
- Welcome. What brings you here?
- We have to talk.

704
01:50:04,070 --> 01:50:07,626
- Well, what is it?
- A message from my boss to your producer.

705
01:50:07,650 --> 01:50:09,930
He isn't here.
I can convey it to him.

706
01:50:10,440 --> 01:50:12,040
The message is only for him.

707
01:50:12,760 --> 01:50:14,360
- When is he expected?
- In half an hour.

708
01:50:14,830 --> 01:50:16,750
- Then we'll wait.
- Sure, be seated.

709
01:51:03,980 --> 01:51:09,970
Where oh where can I go?

710
01:51:16,570 --> 01:51:24,570
Who in this world understands
the distress of a broken heart?

711
01:51:30,760 --> 01:51:34,600
Where oh where can I go?

712
01:52:06,450 --> 01:52:13,090
Life is a series of disappointments

713
01:52:13,520 --> 01:52:19,990
What else remains in this life?

714
01:52:40,870 --> 01:52:47,680
With sadness in my soul
and smoke in my heart...

715
01:52:47,870 --> 01:52:51,690
where oh where can I go?

716
01:53:25,340 --> 01:53:32,040
My heart is full of sadness,
sorrowful for both you and me

717
01:53:32,310 --> 01:53:38,840
There is little hope
for this heart to survive

718
01:53:59,600 --> 01:54:06,070
How can one boat
survive a hundred storms?

719
01:54:06,590 --> 01:54:10,300
Where oh where can I go?

720
01:54:11,100 --> 01:54:19,100
Who in this world understands
the distress of a broken heart?

721
01:54:47,080 --> 01:54:49,640
Excuse me. Come over here, will you?

722
01:54:50,510 --> 01:54:53,080
All right, don't. I'll walk over to you.

723
01:54:53,810 --> 01:54:58,990
Listen to me.
We aren't enemies, are we?

724
01:55:00,060 --> 01:55:03,030
Forget what's past. We're friends now.

725
01:55:06,410 --> 01:55:11,560
Son, we'd be happy if you kept
mum about that matter with the police.

726
01:55:12,010 --> 01:55:14,770
Who do you think you're talking to?
You're talking to Daddy.

727
01:55:21,790 --> 01:55:25,730
- You've trained her to perfection.
- She's very accomplished.

728
01:55:25,940 --> 01:55:29,400
- The audiences would die to hear her in the movies.
- Right.

729
01:55:35,350 --> 01:55:37,040
Lovely voice, isn't it, Boss?

730
01:55:38,750 --> 01:55:41,980
Why only sing? You could
even become a heroine.

731
01:55:43,650 --> 01:55:46,730
- Well, Mr. Producer?
- I was thinking the same.

732
01:55:47,360 --> 01:55:49,170
But what does the director think?

733
01:55:49,660 --> 01:55:53,650
Whatever you and the boss think.

734
01:55:53,960 --> 01:55:59,510
Done. The audiences will
remember every song she sings.

735
01:55:59,770 --> 01:56:03,140
Like a rumba or a samba.

736
01:56:06,830 --> 01:56:11,460
I know an Anglo-Indian girl
who sings at a club. She's fabulous.

737
01:56:12,040 --> 01:56:15,110
- Make sure you hear her. I'll take you there.
- Sure.

738
02:02:59,850 --> 02:03:01,250
Wake up, Mala.

739
02:03:06,110 --> 02:03:08,460
No one moves.

740
02:03:15,310 --> 02:03:17,940
Go on.

741
02:03:20,290 --> 02:03:21,700
Well, son?

742
02:07:37,370 --> 02:07:38,770
Who owns this place?

743
02:07:39,080 --> 02:07:43,760
These hooligans have ruined my club.

744
02:07:44,010 --> 02:07:45,710
That one's the leader of the pack.

745
02:07:46,770 --> 02:07:48,620
There's one more tied up inside.

746
02:07:49,600 --> 02:07:52,390
- I'm a film director.
- Film director? Come along.

747
02:07:54,400 --> 02:07:57,770
The one who was sitting here
is the one who shot at us.

748
02:07:57,930 --> 02:07:59,880
- I think he escaped.
- Move it.

749
02:08:22,060 --> 02:08:23,830
Drink this coffee You'll be alright.

750
02:08:41,470 --> 02:08:44,250
He only has one bullet left. Stay here.

751
02:08:44,590 --> 02:08:45,890
I'll give you.

752
02:09:01,560 --> 02:09:03,230
Now I have you.

753
02:09:19,200 --> 02:09:20,930
Tony, turn on the lights.

754
02:09:31,760 --> 02:09:34,600
Give this to Mr. D'Mello.
Tell him to hand it over to the police.

755
02:09:52,850 --> 02:09:57,280
- Anton, where's Sylvie?
- I don't know. She must've left.

756
02:09:58,970 --> 02:10:01,950
Tell her I'll come back to thank her.

757
02:10:04,890 --> 02:10:06,290
She saved my life.
