1
00:02:59,493 --> 00:03:01,427
What happened?

2
00:03:02,262 --> 00:03:04,162
Why are you crying?

3
00:03:08,168 --> 00:03:10,159
Why are you seated here?

4
00:06:14,354 --> 00:06:16,083
You like it?

5
00:06:26,266 --> 00:06:27,426
East?

6
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,161
East, West.

7
00:06:29,235 --> 00:06:31,100
South and, north.

8
00:06:31,171 --> 00:06:32,263
Excellent!

9
00:06:32,338 --> 00:06:34,101
Why? What happened?
- Yes.

10
00:06:34,174 --> 00:06:35,698
East entrance?
- Yeah.

11
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:37,436
Vastu Shastra.

12
00:06:44,384 --> 00:06:46,181
Your study.

13
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:59,862
This is a big bathroom.

14
00:07:03,336 --> 00:07:06,134
We'll give this room to Rohan.
- Okay.

15
00:07:10,143 --> 00:07:12,077
So, how did you find it?

16
00:07:13,146 --> 00:07:15,273
lt's beautiful, Viraag.
lt's a dream home.

17
00:07:15,348 --> 00:07:16,406
lsn't it?
- Yeah.

18
00:07:16,483 --> 00:07:19,350
And, in a dream price.
- And, the Vastu too is perfect.

19
00:08:18,144 --> 00:08:21,079
Madam, where should this be kept?
- Over there.

20
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:26,141
Carefully.

21
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:29,411
Keep the TV over there.

22
00:09:06,459 --> 00:09:09,223
Hey, kid, work fast. Don't
you have to go home?

23
00:09:09,295 --> 00:09:10,455
C'mon, buddy.

24
00:09:19,138 --> 00:09:20,332
Sis, look at this frame.

25
00:09:20,406 --> 00:09:22,465
One minute, Rohan baby,
you wait here.

26
00:09:23,142 --> 00:09:25,133
l'll check it out.

27
00:09:27,347 --> 00:09:29,076
Okay.

28
00:09:45,164 --> 00:09:46,688
Radz.
- Yes, sis?

29
00:09:46,766 --> 00:09:48,495
Done?
- Yeah.

30
00:09:48,568 --> 00:09:50,763
Look. A goofy for the goofy.

31
00:09:53,172 --> 00:09:56,107
Should l dangle it here?
- Yeah, sis. lt would look nice.

32
00:09:56,175 --> 00:09:57,369
Okay.

33
00:09:57,443 --> 00:09:58,501
O, God.

34
00:10:13,393 --> 00:10:15,122
What are you looking at, sis?

35
00:11:20,193 --> 00:11:22,184
Mama, look.

36
00:11:25,298 --> 00:11:27,198
This is not your ball.
Where did it come from?

37
00:11:27,266 --> 00:11:29,257
lt came all by itself.

38
00:11:31,371 --> 00:11:33,134
One minute.

39
00:11:33,206 --> 00:11:36,471
lt's such a dirty ball. Should
mama clean it and give?

40
00:11:52,425 --> 00:11:55,758
lt's such a beautiful house.
l wish you could be..

41
00:11:56,229 --> 00:11:57,662
Who is it?

42
00:12:03,369 --> 00:12:05,633
Oh. Hi, bro-in-law.
- You didn't sleep yet, Radhika?

43
00:12:05,705 --> 00:12:06,763
No.

44
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:08,773
Actually, l wasn't feeling sleepy
so l was reading the book.

45
00:12:14,781 --> 00:12:16,772
Good night, bro-in-law.
- Good night.

46
00:12:29,395 --> 00:12:31,795
We just got away with it.
lt was my brother in law.

47
00:12:32,398 --> 00:12:33,729
Of course, he went away.

48
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,132
Or else l wouldn't
have spoken to you.

49
00:12:36,402 --> 00:12:38,131
l'm completely alone.

50
00:12:38,404 --> 00:12:39,735
Come, if you have the guts.

51
00:12:39,806 --> 00:12:41,865
Really? And, what would
you do if you come here?

52
00:12:50,216 --> 00:12:52,150
ls Rohan asleep?
- Yeah.

53
00:12:52,218 --> 00:12:54,277
However, it seems to be strange.
- Why?

54
00:12:54,353 --> 00:12:56,480
Rohan is sleeping alone
for the first time.

55
00:12:56,656 --> 00:12:58,146
Let's find a cure for
his loneliness..

56
00:12:58,224 --> 00:12:59,486
..while being alone.

57
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:09,100
What are you doing? What
if; someone sees?

58
00:13:09,168 --> 00:13:10,499
No one is gonna see us.

59
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:13,300
And, if someone really sees,
then let it be.

60
00:13:21,447 --> 00:13:23,608
Cheers, Mr. Rao.
- Mrs. Rao.

61
00:13:28,187 --> 00:13:32,624
To our new home. And, to
our first night. - Alone.

62
00:13:34,193 --> 00:13:38,186
Cheers to..
- Your beautiful mouth.

63
00:13:40,199 --> 00:13:43,532
Cheers to..
- Your sexy eyes.

64
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:46,529
Cheers to..

65
00:13:48,407 --> 00:13:49,738
Let's dance.

66
00:14:20,373 --> 00:14:22,102
Jaya.

67
00:14:23,176 --> 00:14:25,269
The days are coming back to my mind.

68
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:29,171
Which days?

69
00:14:30,283 --> 00:14:33,309
After the marriage. Prior to Rohan.

70
00:14:34,187 --> 00:14:37,384
When we used to bid good night to
each other at morning 6 o'clock.

71
00:14:38,191 --> 00:14:40,318
You forget all that is in the world.

72
00:14:40,393 --> 00:14:42,861
But, you do remember
all such things.

73
00:14:43,296 --> 00:14:46,129
Don't you remember?
- Me?

74
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:49,734
No. l don't remember anything.

75
00:14:49,802 --> 00:14:51,793
Don't remember anything?

76
00:14:52,205 --> 00:14:54,196
Don't remember anything?

77
00:15:19,165 --> 00:15:21,258
Sis! What happened?

78
00:15:21,334 --> 00:15:22,426
Nothing, Radhika.

79
00:15:22,501 --> 00:15:23,695
lt's okay. You go to sleep.

80
00:15:23,769 --> 00:15:25,100
Sure, sis?
- Sure, Radz.

81
00:15:25,171 --> 00:15:26,365
Okay.
- Good night.

82
00:15:26,439 --> 00:15:27,497
Good night.

83
00:15:27,573 --> 00:15:28,631
How might have it fallen, Viraag?

84
00:15:28,708 --> 00:15:30,437
One of its legs might have loosened.

85
00:15:30,509 --> 00:15:32,101
That was close, isn't it?

86
00:15:50,396 --> 00:15:52,728
Rohan. Eat the breakfast
fast, sweetheart.

87
00:15:52,798 --> 00:15:56,393
Mama, how strong will l become
if l eat the banana?

88
00:15:56,469 --> 00:15:58,630
So much of strong.

89
00:15:58,704 --> 00:15:59,796
Now don't make a mess.

90
00:15:59,872 --> 00:16:01,464
And, finish your food
like a good boy. Okay?

91
00:16:01,607 --> 00:16:03,268
Love, your coffee is in the thermos.

92
00:16:03,342 --> 00:16:04,468
Thanks, Jill.

93
00:16:04,543 --> 00:16:06,067
Radz, we're getting
late, sweetheart!

94
00:16:07,146 --> 00:16:10,240
Feed Rohan around 12 o'clock and..

95
00:16:10,349 --> 00:16:12,579
And, l'll boil the milk
around 4 o'clock.

96
00:16:13,152 --> 00:16:14,346
That's great.

97
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:15,478
Won't you forget the carpet?

98
00:16:15,554 --> 00:16:17,351
No. l won't forget
to vacuum clean it.

99
00:16:17,423 --> 00:16:19,152
l won't leave the lights
and fans on in the house.

100
00:16:19,225 --> 00:16:21,420
And, l won't forget to clear
up after having the food.

101
00:16:21,494 --> 00:16:24,429
And, l'll certainly be alive
and l won't forget to breath.

102
00:16:24,497 --> 00:16:26,590
Fine, doctor?
- Love you.

103
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:28,099
Love you, too.

104
00:16:30,503 --> 00:16:32,095
Bye.
- Bye.

105
00:16:32,171 --> 00:16:33,365
Bye, mama.

106
00:16:33,439 --> 00:16:34,770
Bye, Radz.
- Bye, Rohan.

107
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,102
Bye.
- Okay.

108
00:16:36,175 --> 00:16:37,836
Mama is gone.

109
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:42,613
Okay, Spiderman?

110
00:17:10,142 --> 00:17:12,133
Hi! Good morning, doctor.
- Good morning, Rohit.

111
00:17:12,211 --> 00:17:13,337
How are you?

112
00:17:13,412 --> 00:17:16,074
So, how's your new house?
- Oh, it's terrific.

113
00:17:16,148 --> 00:17:18,412
Just 20 minutes away from
here. Pollution free.

114
00:17:18,484 --> 00:17:19,610
And, the Vastu too is perfect.
- Really?

115
00:17:19,685 --> 00:17:20,743
Hi, doctor.
- Hi.

116
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:22,082
Not bad.

117
00:17:22,154 --> 00:17:23,678
Not bad at all. Viraag is
very happy. Mr. Writer.

118
00:17:23,756 --> 00:17:25,087
Good morning, ma'am.
- Good morning.

119
00:17:25,157 --> 00:17:26,488
And, Rohan has gone crazy.

120
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:28,083
Since, there's so much of
space to play. - Really?

121
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,684
That's why it's a great house.

122
00:17:55,388 --> 00:17:57,447
Papa, the ball has stopped.

123
00:18:00,326 --> 00:18:02,726
lt's in mid-air.

124
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:07,731
l'm telling the truth.
lt isn't coming down.

125
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,324
Good. Magic, isn't it? Good.

126
00:18:09,402 --> 00:18:11,393
Papa, it's true! Look at it!

127
00:18:17,343 --> 00:18:19,811
Papa, it's true. The ball did stop.

128
00:18:21,147 --> 00:18:24,480
Rohan, l'm the writer in this house.

129
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:27,576
lt's my job to create
stories and not yours.

130
00:18:27,653 --> 00:18:29,245
Go and play. Go.

131
00:18:29,321 --> 00:18:31,755
Hey. Where are you going over
there? - To fetch the ball.

132
00:18:31,824 --> 00:18:34,759
No. Don't disturb papa. Go. Go. Go.

133
00:19:53,439 --> 00:19:55,771
From now on we'll do likewise.

134
00:19:55,841 --> 00:19:57,775
All the shopping on Saturday.

135
00:19:58,177 --> 00:20:00,372
Yeah. We'll have to do that.

136
00:20:00,446 --> 00:20:02,846
As no one's gonna do a
home delivery in here.

137
00:20:04,183 --> 00:20:06,174
Rohan.

138
00:20:08,187 --> 00:20:10,519
Radz, did you see Rohan?
- No.

139
00:20:10,589 --> 00:20:12,284
He might be playing in his room.

140
00:20:14,193 --> 00:20:16,184
Rohan.

141
00:20:21,267 --> 00:20:23,132
Rohan.

142
00:20:57,436 --> 00:20:59,165
Rohan.

143
00:21:07,179 --> 00:21:10,114
Rohan, what are you
doing here, child?

144
00:21:10,182 --> 00:21:12,776
Papa told not to disturb.

145
00:21:14,286 --> 00:21:16,186
Don't come here alone again.

146
00:21:16,255 --> 00:21:18,382
l'm not alone here.

147
00:21:18,457 --> 00:21:20,516
Oh. Who else is here?

148
00:21:21,193 --> 00:21:23,457
Others live here as well.

149
00:21:29,201 --> 00:21:31,135
Okay.

150
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:33,131
Okay.

151
00:21:33,205 --> 00:21:36,140
Let's do one thing. We'll
leave the others in here.

152
00:21:36,208 --> 00:21:39,473
And, we'll sneak out from here
and take a bath upstairs.

153
00:21:42,414 --> 00:21:46,544
Did Rohan miss mama today?
- l missed you very much.

154
00:22:05,371 --> 00:22:08,772
Radz, it used to be dark in the
previous home as well, isn't it?

155
00:22:08,841 --> 00:22:12,277
Yes. Because the electricity
used to shut down.

156
00:22:13,178 --> 00:22:15,271
Electi..

157
00:22:15,347 --> 00:22:17,315
Electri..
- City.

158
00:22:17,383 --> 00:22:19,442
Electricity.
- Electricity.

159
00:22:19,618 --> 00:22:21,381
What is that?
- That..

160
00:22:21,453 --> 00:22:24,115
Fine. Tell me; what isn't
working in our house?

161
00:22:24,189 --> 00:22:26,521
The lights aren't working.
The fans aren't working.

162
00:22:26,592 --> 00:22:27,650
The TV?

163
00:22:27,726 --> 00:22:29,387
That's right, sweetheart.
The TV is also not working.

164
00:22:29,461 --> 00:22:30,519
Very good.

165
00:22:30,596 --> 00:22:33,724
So, it's this electricity that
makes all these things work.

166
00:22:33,799 --> 00:22:35,790
So, why isn't it visible to us?

167
00:22:37,202 --> 00:22:38,669
Point.

168
00:22:38,737 --> 00:22:41,865
Are you hungry now?
- Yes.

169
00:22:42,307 --> 00:22:46,471
But, is the hunger visible to you?
- No.

170
00:22:47,212 --> 00:22:50,147
Because, Rohan, there're
some things which..

171
00:22:50,215 --> 00:22:52,149
..do exist but are not visible.

172
00:22:52,217 --> 00:22:55,152
And, there are some things
that are visible..

173
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:57,154
..but they don't exist.

174
00:22:57,222 --> 00:22:59,156
Wow! Candle light dinner.

175
00:22:59,224 --> 00:23:01,692
Did you find anything?
- l really don't understand, Jill.

176
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:05,093
All the fuses are fine. l
don't know what happened.

177
00:23:06,165 --> 00:23:08,258
What sort of a wind is this?
- What happened?

178
00:23:08,333 --> 00:23:10,267
lt's okay. l'll see to it.

179
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:12,496
Jill.
- Yeah?

180
00:23:12,571 --> 00:23:14,596
l think the black out is
not only in our house..

181
00:23:14,673 --> 00:23:16,106
..but, in the whole of vicinity.

182
00:23:16,442 --> 00:23:18,706
And, how will we know that
it's in our house..

183
00:23:18,777 --> 00:23:21,268
..or in the whole of the vicinity?

184
00:23:21,346 --> 00:23:24,179
No one stays near us as well.

185
00:23:24,249 --> 00:23:27,707
lt lives here but it isn't visible.
- Really? Who is it, buddy?

186
00:23:27,786 --> 00:23:29,378
Electricity.

187
00:23:29,455 --> 00:23:31,184
Hey, good one.

188
00:23:40,399 --> 00:23:42,196
What happened, Jill?

189
00:23:49,408 --> 00:23:53,310
Relax, mate. lt happens sometimes.

190
00:23:53,378 --> 00:23:55,346
We feel that we saw someone.

191
00:23:55,414 --> 00:23:56,540
lt's just an illusion.

192
00:23:56,615 --> 00:23:59,641
Doctor, l think you're stressed
out. That's it.

193
00:24:01,153 --> 00:24:02,586
l don't know, Viraag.

194
00:24:02,654 --> 00:24:04,747
Come on. lt's just your fallacy.

195
00:24:04,823 --> 00:24:06,256
They are all mind games.

196
00:24:06,325 --> 00:24:10,762
What mind games, Viraag? Today,
l really got scared.

197
00:24:11,163 --> 00:24:15,827
l couldn't get it.. He was
standing in front of me.

198
00:24:16,168 --> 00:24:20,605
l do understand that whatever
l was seeing wasn't real.

199
00:24:20,672 --> 00:24:22,435
lt was imaginary.

200
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:26,637
But, from so close-by?

201
00:24:27,179 --> 00:24:29,170
And, so much clearly.

202
00:24:30,382 --> 00:24:32,612
You won't even believe..

203
00:24:34,453 --> 00:24:36,114
Viraag.

204
00:24:40,726 --> 00:24:42,125
Viraag.

205
00:24:50,803 --> 00:24:52,134
Viraag!

206
00:25:07,419 --> 00:25:09,080
Viraag.

207
00:25:16,161 --> 00:25:18,152
Viraag!

208
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:30,364
See? l told you, mind games.
- That was not funny, Viraag.

209
00:25:30,509 --> 00:25:33,273
l'm sorry. l'm really sorry.

210
00:25:33,345 --> 00:25:35,279
l'm sorry.

211
00:26:01,139 --> 00:26:03,664
Rohan will be a good boy today,
Jill. Don't worry.

212
00:26:03,742 --> 00:26:07,473
Okay, Rohan? Listen to papa.
Sure? Won't you forget?

213
00:26:07,546 --> 00:26:09,070
Promise?

214
00:26:10,148 --> 00:26:12,082
Bye.

215
00:26:12,417 --> 00:26:17,354
Sis, there's a joint study at my
friend Molly Banerjee's house.

216
00:26:18,156 --> 00:26:22,149
So, l'll get a bit late.
- A bit late, okay?

217
00:26:22,261 --> 00:26:24,491
Sis, that Molly will drop me.

218
00:26:26,164 --> 00:26:27,256
All right.

219
00:26:28,166 --> 00:26:30,157
Hey! Stop! Stop!

220
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:33,432
Stop the car!

221
00:26:33,505 --> 00:26:34,563
Stop the car!

222
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,267
Stop the car!

223
00:26:36,341 --> 00:26:38,104
Crazy.

224
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:44,171
You'll all die!

225
00:26:48,387 --> 00:26:49,615
Listen!

226
00:26:49,688 --> 00:26:50,848
You'll all die!

227
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:10,131
Around at..

228
00:27:56,388 --> 00:27:58,117
Rohan.

229
00:27:59,191 --> 00:28:00,385
Rohan.

230
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,050
Rohan.

231
00:28:04,129 --> 00:28:06,120
Hey, junior!

232
00:28:07,332 --> 00:28:09,061
Mr. Rohan.

233
00:28:10,335 --> 00:28:12,064
Rohan!

234
00:28:16,341 --> 00:28:18,070
Rohan.

235
00:28:19,344 --> 00:28:21,073
Hey, Roh..

236
00:30:37,749 --> 00:30:39,649
Rohan!

237
00:31:16,188 --> 00:31:19,282
Rohan, what are you doing here?

238
00:31:19,391 --> 00:31:22,451
l'm talking to my friends.

239
00:31:25,197 --> 00:31:28,394
Friends? Who are your
friends, junior?

240
00:31:28,466 --> 00:31:30,457
Manish and Jyoti.

241
00:31:32,204 --> 00:31:33,466
Really?

242
00:31:33,538 --> 00:31:35,631
Where did your friends go away?
Did they went away?

243
00:31:35,707 --> 00:31:38,301
To their homes. Over there.

244
00:31:40,212 --> 00:31:42,203
Okay. Then, we'll also
go to our home.

245
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,747
And, we'll bid bye to your friends.

246
00:31:43,815 --> 00:31:45,874
Bye, Manish. Bye, Jyoti.

247
00:31:54,226 --> 00:31:56,421
Manish and Jyoti? Nice.

248
00:31:56,494 --> 00:31:58,223
And, do you know where they stay?

249
00:31:58,296 --> 00:32:00,161
Over that Banyan tree.

250
00:32:02,234 --> 00:32:06,261
Mama, Manish and Jyoti are
for real. - For real?

251
00:32:06,338 --> 00:32:09,705
That's it. Another writer
is on his way.

252
00:32:09,774 --> 00:32:12,106
Do become whatever you want;
but not a dumb like papa.

253
00:32:12,177 --> 00:32:14,111
Okay?

254
00:32:14,179 --> 00:32:16,443
Hey, madam.

255
00:32:16,615 --> 00:32:18,776
lt seems the doctor
ma'am hasn't noticed.

256
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:20,784
The house is clean.
The kitchen is clean.

257
00:32:20,852 --> 00:32:23,286
Moreover, Rohan had
his meal on time.

258
00:32:23,355 --> 00:32:25,118
Hey, Rohan. Tell your mom.

259
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:26,521
Mama, should l go to play?

260
00:32:29,194 --> 00:32:30,388
Yes. Please go.

261
00:32:30,462 --> 00:32:32,123
Play and come back.

262
00:32:32,197 --> 00:32:33,459
Be careful, kid.

263
00:32:46,211 --> 00:32:48,338
C'mon, get up ma'am.
Your home has come.

264
00:32:48,413 --> 00:32:49,471
What?

265
00:32:49,547 --> 00:32:50,639
Stop. Stop.

266
00:32:50,715 --> 00:32:52,342
Stop it here. Or else sis will see.

267
00:32:52,417 --> 00:32:54,146
Radz, am l scared of
your sister or what?

268
00:32:54,219 --> 00:32:55,345
What is she gonna do?

269
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:56,546
Will she get me left
right and center?

270
00:32:56,621 --> 00:32:58,350
Only center.

271
00:32:58,423 --> 00:33:00,152
Bye. Good night.

272
00:33:01,326 --> 00:33:03,089
Miss Molly Banerjee.

273
00:34:50,201 --> 00:34:52,192
What happened?

274
00:34:53,405 --> 00:34:55,134
A nightmare.

275
00:34:56,207 --> 00:34:58,141
My Radhika got scared?

276
00:34:58,209 --> 00:35:00,143
Okay. Okay. Good night now.

277
00:35:02,414 --> 00:35:03,472
Bye.

278
00:35:03,548 --> 00:35:04,674
Am l scared of your sister or what?

279
00:35:04,749 --> 00:35:07,240
What is she gonna do? Get
me left right and center?

280
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:10,081
What did you say?

281
00:35:10,422 --> 00:35:11,582
Bye.

282
00:36:33,171 --> 00:36:35,162
What happened?

283
00:36:38,176 --> 00:36:39,438
What?

284
00:36:43,448 --> 00:36:45,109
Are you all right?

285
00:36:46,184 --> 00:36:50,177
l got scared and hence
l scampered in here.

286
00:36:51,289 --> 00:36:53,120
Look at me.

287
00:36:53,458 --> 00:36:55,449
Sure?
- Yeah.

288
00:36:56,194 --> 00:36:58,128
l'll heat the food.

289
00:38:52,377 --> 00:38:54,106
Rohan.

290
00:39:04,389 --> 00:39:06,050
Rohan?

291
00:39:10,128 --> 00:39:12,119
Rohan!

292
00:39:15,233 --> 00:39:17,064
Rohan!

293
00:39:19,337 --> 00:39:21,669
Where has he gone?
- l don't know.

294
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:24,137
lt's 3 at night.

295
00:39:24,208 --> 00:39:25,266
Rohan!

296
00:39:25,343 --> 00:39:27,072
l've checked it everywhere.
He isn't upstairs as well.

297
00:39:27,145 --> 00:39:28,669
Did you check it outside?
- No.

298
00:39:28,746 --> 00:39:30,077
l'll check it out.

299
00:39:30,148 --> 00:39:32,082
Rohan!

300
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:33,242
Rohan!

301
00:39:34,152 --> 00:39:35,244
Rohan!

302
00:39:35,319 --> 00:39:37,082
Rohan!

303
00:39:40,158 --> 00:39:42,092
Rohan!

304
00:39:44,495 --> 00:39:46,087
Rohan!

305
00:39:50,501 --> 00:39:52,093
Rohan!

306
00:39:56,374 --> 00:39:58,103
Rohan!

307
00:39:58,176 --> 00:39:59,268
Rohan!

308
00:40:16,194 --> 00:40:18,128
Jill, did you find Rohan?

309
00:40:46,224 --> 00:40:48,215
Rohan.

310
00:41:01,372 --> 00:41:03,101
Rohan.

311
00:41:06,177 --> 00:41:08,441
Child, mama and papa
are very much tense.

312
00:41:08,513 --> 00:41:10,447
Why did you go there?

313
00:41:11,182 --> 00:41:13,446
Mama, l'm telling the truth.

314
00:41:14,185 --> 00:41:17,120
Manish and Jyoti weren't
able to sleep.

315
00:41:17,188 --> 00:41:18,450
And, so l..

316
00:41:18,523 --> 00:41:19,615
So, you were singing nursery
rhymes for them..

317
00:41:19,690 --> 00:41:21,123
..and playing with them, isn't it?

318
00:41:21,192 --> 00:41:23,126
Rohan!

319
00:41:23,194 --> 00:41:26,459
Don't you understand what
mama is asking? Speak up!

320
00:41:26,531 --> 00:41:28,465
l'm feeling sleepy.

321
00:42:14,378 --> 00:42:17,108
What do you think?
- Don't know, Viraag.

322
00:42:19,183 --> 00:42:22,516
l mean, he has no friends over here

323
00:42:24,188 --> 00:42:26,122
This place is so big.

324
00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:29,284
Perhaps, he isn't able
to handle the space.

325
00:42:30,394 --> 00:42:33,124
Moreover, he's so much
of imaginative.

326
00:42:35,199 --> 00:42:38,464
l don't know, Viraag. l don't know.

327
00:42:59,223 --> 00:43:02,420
Murli, you don't have any
idea. lt was so scary.

328
00:43:03,628 --> 00:43:05,755
He had directly climbed up the tree.

329
00:43:06,163 --> 00:43:08,097
We were so scared. Anyway.. we..

330
00:43:08,165 --> 00:43:11,100
..have got a maid to
look after him today.

331
00:43:12,169 --> 00:43:14,103
l think she has come from
the nearby village.

332
00:43:14,171 --> 00:43:16,435
l don't want to drink milk.
- Please drink it, Rohan.

333
00:43:16,507 --> 00:43:19,772
No, l don't want to drink it.
- Please drink it. - No.

334
00:43:21,712 --> 00:43:23,111
Okay, don't drink it.
Manish ad Jyoti..

335
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:25,273
..have drunk the milk
a long time ago.

336
00:43:25,449 --> 00:43:27,110
How do you know that?

337
00:43:27,184 --> 00:43:30,517
They are my friends, isn't it?
- Are they your friends too?

338
00:43:31,188 --> 00:43:33,452
Yes, they had met me a while back.

339
00:43:33,658 --> 00:43:35,785
What were they saying?
- They told me..

340
00:43:36,193 --> 00:43:38,593
As soon as Rohan drinks
the milk quickly..

341
00:43:38,663 --> 00:43:40,790
..they will come here to play. Okay?

342
00:43:41,198 --> 00:43:43,132
Here.. drink it. Drink it. Drink it.

343
00:43:56,614 --> 00:43:59,811
Tell me. What else did
Manish and Jyoti say?

344
00:44:00,151 --> 00:44:03,086
Yes? They said that Rohan
is a very good boy.

345
00:44:03,154 --> 00:44:05,418
He doesn't cry while playing at all.

346
00:44:05,489 --> 00:44:08,083
But you told me that they
will come to play with us.

347
00:44:08,225 --> 00:44:11,422
Yes. they will play.. they
will play in your tent.

348
00:44:11,495 --> 00:44:13,759
They will play with
this dog of yours.

349
00:44:14,165 --> 00:44:17,100
His name is Fluffy.
- Yes.. okay. Okay..

350
00:44:17,168 --> 00:44:19,762
Come on now. Eat the sandwich
quickly, okay?

351
00:44:20,171 --> 00:44:23,106
Come on, come on, come on, eat
it quickly. Good son. Come on.

352
00:44:23,174 --> 00:44:24,436
What else did they say?

353
00:44:24,508 --> 00:44:28,103
They said that they will come
here and create a hullabaloo.

354
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:30,442
What will they do?

355
00:44:31,182 --> 00:44:36,119
Hullabaloo means.. they will
have fun.. okay. Fun!

356
00:44:36,187 --> 00:44:39,122
Come on now. Quickly, eat
the sandwich now, okay.

357
00:44:39,190 --> 00:44:42,523
Madam.. your son is very good.

358
00:44:42,593 --> 00:44:44,788
He doesn't trouble me at all.

359
00:44:56,474 --> 00:44:59,136
ls it done, son? Come on, quickly.

360
00:44:59,643 --> 00:45:01,235
Oh God!

361
00:45:14,258 --> 00:45:17,250
Rohan.. what is this?

362
00:45:17,328 --> 00:45:19,762
Hullabaloo.
- What?

363
00:45:19,830 --> 00:45:23,425
Manish and Jyoti came. You said it.

364
00:45:29,607 --> 00:45:31,438
Hey. What are you blabbering?

365
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:38,111
What is it?

366
00:45:39,450 --> 00:45:44,114
Manish and Jyoti.. there..

367
00:45:52,630 --> 00:45:54,621
Beneath the bed?
- Yes.

368
00:46:37,274 --> 00:46:43,110
Mummy, l didn't do anything.
- Give me the ball. Give it.

369
00:46:45,282 --> 00:46:47,443
Radhika. This ball
shouldn't be seen..

370
00:46:47,518 --> 00:46:49,281
..in Rohan's hands ever again.
Keep it out of his reach.

371
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:53,112
Rohan.. right at this time,
apologize to Rukma.

372
00:46:53,190 --> 00:46:59,618
Mom, it was Manish's ball.
Manish did it. - Rohan!

373
00:47:00,131 --> 00:47:03,066
Forget it madam, he is a kid.
- No, Rukma.

374
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:05,231
You will say sorry right now.

375
00:47:05,302 --> 00:47:09,068
Mummy, l didn't do anything.
l didn't do anything.

376
00:47:10,241 --> 00:47:12,573
Rohan.. crying won't help. Rohan..

377
00:47:13,077 --> 00:47:15,409
He is a kid.
- l know, but Viraag.. - l will see.

378
00:47:15,479 --> 00:47:17,071
l will take care of him. Okay?

379
00:47:46,277 --> 00:47:48,609
Will you have an ice cream?
Strawberry?

380
00:47:49,446 --> 00:47:51,607
Okay, tell me whether you will
have it in a cup or a cone.

381
00:47:54,618 --> 00:47:56,449
lt seems that Junior is very upset.

382
00:47:57,288 --> 00:47:59,449
But papa is not upset.
l am downstairs.

383
00:47:59,523 --> 00:48:03,050
Come down whenever you
wish. Okay? Okay.

384
00:48:35,426 --> 00:48:37,587
Manish, because of you, was scolded.

385
00:48:40,431 --> 00:48:42,592
You threw the ball,
you go and apologize.

386
00:48:58,449 --> 00:49:01,384
What did l just tell you? Switch
the damn thing off. - Please..

387
00:49:01,452 --> 00:49:03,215
Watch out!

388
00:49:05,055 --> 00:49:08,047
Hey.. hey.. you didn't say
anything to your husband.

389
00:49:08,125 --> 00:49:10,218
Hey, nobody told you?
Nobody told you?

390
00:49:10,294 --> 00:49:12,728
Nobody came back going
there, nobody.

391
00:49:12,796 --> 00:49:15,060
Listen to me. Hey! Listen
to me! Listen to me!

392
00:49:15,132 --> 00:49:18,067
Hey, listen to me! Listen
to me! Listen to me!

393
00:49:50,434 --> 00:49:54,097
Why did you throw the ball?
- l didn't throw it.

394
00:49:54,171 --> 00:49:58,164
l don't throw it! Hey! Don't
play this drama with me.

395
00:50:00,177 --> 00:50:02,839
That room behind, l
will throw you there.

396
00:50:02,913 --> 00:50:04,107
Do you what all is there?

397
00:50:05,115 --> 00:50:07,606
There are many dangerous
ghosts there.

398
00:50:07,685 --> 00:50:10,620
Witches live there. The
small children like you..

399
00:50:10,688 --> 00:50:14,624
They have small necks, they cut
them and drink their blood.

400
00:50:14,692 --> 00:50:17,354
l will throw you there.
- l will tell Taya.

401
00:50:18,128 --> 00:50:22,622
What will you tell her?
- l will say that you are not good.

402
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:24,463
Why?

403
00:50:26,136 --> 00:50:28,127
You are a thief, l saw everything.

404
00:50:31,642 --> 00:50:36,636
Yes, Rohan..
- Nothing sir, Rohan wants to play.

405
00:50:36,714 --> 00:50:39,148
He wants to go outside,
can l take him? - Okay.

406
00:50:42,319 --> 00:50:45,311
You kid! Come on! l will show you!

407
00:50:45,389 --> 00:50:49,655
l will show you! You will complain
against me! You dog!

408
00:50:54,565 --> 00:50:58,160
Hi, Jill. - How is Rohan, Viraag?
- Yes, he is all right.

409
00:50:59,336 --> 00:51:03,272
Can l speak to him?
- No. He has gone out with Rukma.

410
00:51:04,441 --> 00:51:11,438
l steal! l hit you! l hit you!
You wretch! Come on! Come on!

411
00:51:11,515 --> 00:51:13,608
l will show you!
- Let me go! - lf l leave you..

412
00:51:13,684 --> 00:51:16,278
..won't l have to leave my job too?

413
00:51:16,453 --> 00:51:22,619
l will show you! You will
meddle with Rukma?

414
00:51:32,302 --> 00:51:34,463
You wretch!
- No, Rukma! No, Rukma!

415
00:51:34,538 --> 00:51:37,132
See, what l will do with you now!
- No!

416
00:51:37,207 --> 00:51:42,201
l will show you!
- No, Rukma!

417
00:51:46,316 --> 00:51:48,147
Hey, will you kill him?

418
00:51:51,321 --> 00:51:53,152
The next time l will
really push you.

419
00:51:54,324 --> 00:51:56,656
l will make chutney out
of you, understood?

420
00:51:58,328 --> 00:52:00,159
Mummy, l want to tell
you that Rukma..

421
00:52:16,613 --> 00:52:21,448
Rukma took me to the road.
She hit me. She scared me.

422
00:52:21,518 --> 00:52:24,612
She said that ghosts will slash
my neck and drink blood.

423
00:52:27,458 --> 00:52:29,289
Rohan..

424
00:52:29,359 --> 00:52:31,452
l have forgotten the morning matter.

425
00:52:31,528 --> 00:52:35,123
Even Rukma has forgotten about
it. But this is too much.

426
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:39,792
You made stories about your
fake friends. lt's okay.

427
00:52:41,305 --> 00:52:44,138
But one doesn't say fake things
against real people.

428
00:52:44,208 --> 00:52:46,142
This is wrong.

429
00:52:48,479 --> 00:52:50,140
Do you understand what l am saying?

430
00:52:50,214 --> 00:52:51,738
Do you understand me?

431
00:52:51,815 --> 00:52:54,477
Mummy, she stole our golden
dragon today too.

432
00:53:02,259 --> 00:53:05,092
Viraag, please talk to him. Why
is he talking like this?

433
00:53:05,162 --> 00:53:07,596
lt is okay, Jill. Just relax.

434
00:53:08,265 --> 00:53:13,100
Sister.. sister you please go. l
will feed him and have him sleep.

435
00:53:13,170 --> 00:53:15,104
You go.

436
00:53:23,113 --> 00:53:25,104
Rohan..

437
00:53:46,637 --> 00:53:49,629
What happened, madam?
ls he all right?

438
00:53:50,307 --> 00:53:52,138
Yes, he is all right.

439
00:53:53,644 --> 00:53:57,637
ln adjusting.. he is fine.. Rukma..

440
00:54:00,150 --> 00:54:02,084
Madam, it was the first
day today, isn't it?

441
00:54:03,086 --> 00:54:05,384
You will see from tomorrow,
everything will be all right.

442
00:54:07,090 --> 00:54:09,581
You please don't worry.
He is a kid, isn't it?

443
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:12,094
He will act like this.

444
00:54:14,598 --> 00:54:16,088
You please don't worry.

445
00:54:16,166 --> 00:54:18,600
With love and slowly, everything
will be all right.

446
00:54:22,272 --> 00:54:29,269
Shall l leave now? - Yes, take
care of the wound. - Yes.

447
00:54:29,346 --> 00:54:31,109
Thank you, Rukma.

448
00:55:00,143 --> 00:55:02,077
l think something is really
disturbing him.

449
00:55:02,145 --> 00:55:04,079
Maybe, we weren't able
to understand it.

450
00:55:04,147 --> 00:55:07,082
What do you mean?
- l don't know.

451
00:55:12,422 --> 00:55:16,256
We should show Rohan to someone.
- You mean..

452
00:55:18,261 --> 00:55:20,092
A child psychiatrist?

453
00:55:32,275 --> 00:55:35,438
'Oh! The youth of a young girl..'

454
00:55:36,279 --> 00:55:40,613
'Oh! The youth of a young girl..'

455
01:00:47,820 --> 01:00:50,152
Mr. Rao?
- What is the matter, inspector?

456
01:00:50,222 --> 01:00:52,986
Our idea is that it is
a hit and run case.

457
01:00:53,826 --> 01:00:56,920
lt can be some truck, tempo
or some big vehicle.

458
01:01:03,268 --> 01:01:05,930
Our son Rohan, was saying
something about Rukma.

459
01:01:07,272 --> 01:01:08,933
What was he saying?

460
01:01:09,775 --> 01:01:11,766
Just that..

461
01:01:12,111 --> 01:01:14,272
Rukma stole some things
from the house.

462
01:01:28,961 --> 01:01:34,957
Something from this is yours
too, right? - Yes.

463
01:01:36,135 --> 01:01:39,969
During this investigation,
we questioned some inns.

464
01:01:40,039 --> 01:01:41,973
A truck driver then told us..

465
01:01:42,975 --> 01:01:44,135
..that yesterday evening..

466
01:01:44,977 --> 01:01:47,810
Rukma.. no.. Rukma.. no..
- Come on.

467
01:02:03,929 --> 01:02:06,921
Whoever trampled Rukma
will be caught soon.

468
01:02:23,782 --> 01:02:25,773
Rukma hurt you a lot, isn't it?

469
01:02:27,953 --> 01:02:30,387
l don't like Rukma, mother.

470
01:02:36,462 --> 01:02:37,952
Even l don't like her.

471
01:02:39,965 --> 01:02:41,956
Mummy is sorry, Rohan.

472
01:02:42,968 --> 01:02:44,799
She will never come to you.

473
01:02:44,870 --> 01:02:46,303
Hey, where are you?
l am waiting for you.

474
01:02:46,371 --> 01:02:49,306
Murli, listen to me. l am not
coming to the college today.

475
01:02:49,374 --> 01:02:50,807
What do you mean
you aren't coming?

476
01:02:50,876 --> 01:02:52,810
See, l am waiting for
you since so long!

477
01:02:52,878 --> 01:02:54,072
Do you remember we had a date?

478
01:02:54,146 --> 01:02:55,408
You had promised me!
- Yes. but..

479
01:02:55,481 --> 01:02:57,244
That Rohan's maid was killed.
- What?

480
01:02:57,316 --> 01:03:03,915
You won't believe this, Murli.
She used to hit Rohan.

481
01:03:03,989 --> 01:03:06,082
And she used to threaten
and scare him.

482
01:03:06,158 --> 01:03:07,921
What a bloody bitch she was!

483
01:04:05,918 --> 01:04:07,749
Rohan.. wait.

484
01:04:07,820 --> 01:04:09,754
No. l don't want to listen to you.

485
01:04:09,822 --> 01:04:14,418
lf you eat this quickly, l will
make strawberry jelly for you.

486
01:04:14,493 --> 01:04:17,257
Will my tongue become red?
- lt will become red.

487
01:04:17,329 --> 01:04:18,762
Like this, see.

488
01:04:22,100 --> 01:04:23,761
You ate it, isn't it?

489
01:04:24,770 --> 01:04:28,103
The last one, come on. - l don't
want it. - Open your mouth..

490
01:05:34,773 --> 01:05:36,104
Brother-in-law..
- Yes?

491
01:05:36,174 --> 01:05:37,766
l am making some jelly,
will you have it?

492
01:05:37,843 --> 01:05:40,277
No, thanks.
- Okay.

493
01:05:45,117 --> 01:05:48,780
They hit like this. ls mad! ls mad!
Don't wait. Don't wait!

494
01:05:48,854 --> 01:05:53,291
Below the car, like this Rukma..
like this.. is mad! ls mad!

495
01:05:53,358 --> 01:05:55,724
No.. no.. you don't do anything.

496
01:05:55,794 --> 01:05:59,321
l will drive them away. You
run away! You run away!

497
01:05:59,398 --> 01:06:03,061
Below the truck. ln an accident.
- Rukma! Rukma!

498
01:06:03,902 --> 01:06:05,233
Security, where are the guards?

499
01:06:05,304 --> 01:06:07,033
Send them up right now.

500
01:06:07,105 --> 01:06:10,734
Didn't l tell you? Under a truck.
- ls mad! ls mad!

501
01:06:10,809 --> 01:06:14,745
Like this.. like this..

Take him away right now.
- Come! Come on!

503
01:06:17,816 --> 01:06:21,752
ls mad! ls mad! ls mad! ls mad!

504
01:06:26,758 --> 01:06:28,919
Hey, run away! Run away!

505
01:06:29,928 --> 01:06:37,425
Hey, in the village..
how did Rukma die?

506
01:06:38,103 --> 01:06:41,937
No body will be spared,
everyone will be killed.

507
01:08:05,223 --> 01:08:08,215
Rohan.. what are you doing?
You will fall down.

508
01:08:09,728 --> 01:08:11,719
l was closing both the curtains.

509
01:08:11,797 --> 01:08:15,062
No, go and play outside. Your
cycle is out, come on. - Okay.

510
01:09:14,059 --> 01:09:15,890
Rohan. Once again.

511
01:09:15,961 --> 01:09:20,057
Mummy, l saw a bad man. And
there was a bad aunt too.

512
01:09:20,132 --> 01:09:22,225
There. Up there.

513
01:09:22,734 --> 01:09:24,725
Rohan.. come here.

514
01:09:28,740 --> 01:09:30,731
Come..

515
01:09:30,809 --> 01:09:33,744
Junior.. if you see the
bad man once again..

516
01:09:33,812 --> 01:09:36,804
..come and tell straight
away, okay? - Okay.

517
01:09:36,882 --> 01:09:39,077
Okay. Go and play now.

518
01:11:11,943 --> 01:11:13,774
Oh God!

519
01:12:10,935 --> 01:12:14,769
Pa.. Pa.. Pa..

520
01:12:14,839 --> 01:12:17,273
Rohan.. what is the matter?

521
01:12:17,342 --> 01:12:20,277
There is the bad man in
Rad's room. l saw him.

522
01:12:24,115 --> 01:12:25,776
Who is it?

523
01:12:33,792 --> 01:12:35,783
Who is it here?

524
01:13:21,940 --> 01:13:25,933
Hello.
- Murli.. what are you doing here?

525
01:13:26,010 --> 01:13:29,275
Hey, you aren't to been since

Hi, Radz. - What happened?

01:13:45,864 --> 01:13:47,957
What is the matter?
Everyone together?

530
01:13:48,032 --> 01:13:50,125
Ask your brother-in-law,

01:13:50,201 --> 01:13:53,295
But so late in the night..
- Viraag.. please explain.

532
01:13:54,072 --> 01:13:56,734
Actually, Rohan thought there
was someone in your room.

533
01:13:56,808 --> 01:13:59,242
Bad man, l saw him.

534
01:13:59,911 --> 01:14:03,904

01:14:32,777 --> 01:14:34,768
Whom are you looking for?

542
01:14:34,846 --> 01:14:37,110
Murli, do you know who you are?

543
01:14:38,950 --> 01:14:40,281
Bad man!

544
01:14:40,351 --> 01:14:42,285
Just shut up! Too much!
You are too much!

545
01:15:06,077 --> 01:15:07,738
Rohan..

546
01:15:09,080 --> 01:15:13,073
Mummy is going now. Papa will
be out of the home too.

547
01:15:13,918 --> 01:15:17,911
Don't trouble Radz aunty.
Be a good boy.

548
01:15:18,756 --> 01:15:20,087
Okay.

549
01:15:21,759 --> 01:15:23,750
Sweet heart.

01:15:25,763 --> 01:15:27,924
Yes, Ravi. l am leaving now. Yes.

551
01:15:27,999 --> 01:15:31,093
Yes, Mr. Publisher. l will
be with you the whole day.

552
01:15:31,169 --> 01:15:33,763
Yes, the work is going
on absolutely fine.

553
01:15:34,272 --> 01:15:37,764
l will drop Jill and come
to you. She's fine.

554
01:15:37,842 --> 01:15:40,936
Yes, Ravi. Fine. Bye.

555
01:15:44,949 --> 01:15:47,110
Did you talk to the psychiatrist?
- Yes, eleven o'clock.

556
01:15:48,786 --> 01:15:51,778
Bye.. - Tell bye to mama.
- Bye.. - Bye, Rohan.

557
01:15:52,957 --> 01:15:54,720
We are all alone now.

558
01:16:00,899 --> 01:16:03,231
How in the night, Murli?
Everyone will be at home.

559
01:16:03,301 --> 01:16:04,734
l will try. Okay. Come on now.
Rohan is in a bad mood.

560
01:16:04,802 --> 01:16:06,235
Come on now. Bye.

561
01:16:08,740 --> 01:16:15,077
Rohan.. here, for you. A juice.
Wow! Who is this?

562
01:16:15,914 --> 01:16:19,077
Manish and Jyoti.
- They are your friends, isn't it?

563
01:16:19,751 --> 01:16:23,915
They are no longer my friends.
- Why? What happened?

564
01:16:24,923 --> 01:16:27,756
They are angry. All
of them are angry.

565
01:16:27,825 --> 01:16:29,258
Who, all of them?

566
01:16:29,928 --> 01:16:33,261
The ones who stay in our house.
- What?

567
01:16:34,933 --> 01:16:38,266
They don't like us. When
we are sleeping..

568
01:16:38,336 --> 01:16:40,770
..they roam around the whole
house, angrily, there.

569
01:16:47,278 --> 01:16:51,271
There. All around the house.

570
01:16:53,785 --> 01:16:55,377
What nonsense, Rohan?

571
01:16:55,453 --> 01:16:58,889
Sometimes, they look at
our beds like this.

572
01:16:59,724 --> 01:17:02,056
They come to your room too, Radz.

573
01:17:03,061 --> 01:17:06,224
Just like the bad man came
to your room yesterday.

574
01:17:09,901 --> 01:17:15,066
There is no bad man here.
- This is the bad man.

575
01:17:15,740 --> 01:17:17,731
Silent. Absolutely silent.

576
01:17:17,809 --> 01:17:20,004
Didn't mummy tell you
not to lie to anyone?

577
01:17:25,083 --> 01:17:26,914
What did the psychiatrist say?

578
01:17:27,919 --> 01:17:30,387
Hallucinations and visual
dreams, it seems.

579
01:17:31,089 --> 01:17:33,421
We will have him go through
some clinical tests. - Tests?

580
01:17:33,491 --> 01:17:34,981
lt's routine.

581
01:17:36,260 --> 01:17:38,251
And l have appointment
at ten at Tuesday.

582
01:17:38,429 --> 01:17:41,762
Did he say anything else?
- Yes. Keep Rohan busy.

583
01:17:41,833 --> 01:17:46,099
Spend as much time as
possible with him.

584
01:17:46,170 --> 01:17:48,104
As much as the child
stays occupied..

585
01:17:48,172 --> 01:17:49,935
..his mind will that
much less divided.

586
01:17:50,008 --> 01:17:52,272
You understand?
- Yes, l can understand.

587
01:17:56,881 --> 01:17:59,714
Mummy.. mummy..
- Oh! Where are you coming from?

588
01:17:59,784 --> 01:18:03,049
How was your day?
- lt was very good.

589
01:18:03,888 --> 01:18:06,049
You want to go to the cinema?
Cartoon film?

590
01:18:06,124 --> 01:18:08,217
Viraag, l think that
it's a great idea.

591
01:18:08,292 --> 01:18:11,056
Come on. - Yes, Radz.. - We
will go for a cartoon film.

592
01:18:11,129 --> 01:18:12,721
l.. l hate cartoon films.

593
01:18:12,797 --> 01:18:14,731
Okay. Okay.

594
01:18:14,799 --> 01:18:17,063
Radz sister is not there.
We will see the picture.

595
01:18:17,135 --> 01:18:18,966
We will eat pop corn and..
- We will drink cold drink too.

596
01:18:23,074 --> 01:18:24,735
Oh God!

597
01:19:50,762 --> 01:19:52,753
Hi..
- Hi..

598
01:19:59,937 --> 01:20:01,768
Come in.

599
01:21:20,918 --> 01:21:25,116
Murli? Where are you, mate?

600
01:21:25,323 --> 01:21:27,450
What is this? Such a tease.

601
01:21:31,195 --> 01:21:32,787
Where are you?

602
01:21:36,334 --> 01:21:37,460
Murli?

603
01:22:11,836 --> 01:22:13,770
Stop it now, man!

604
01:22:24,181 --> 01:22:27,446
Murli, don't you tell
me if sis comes.

605
01:22:42,867 --> 01:22:44,801
Murli, come out, man!

606
01:22:59,817 --> 01:23:02,081
Murli, this is the room
of sis and bro in law.

607
01:23:02,219 --> 01:23:06,417
Don't even think of doing
anything in here. Murli?

608
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:11,758
Oh God! This hide and seek..

609
01:23:19,837 --> 01:23:22,101
Murli, it's not funny anymore.

610
01:23:25,843 --> 01:23:27,777
Sis and bro in law can
be back anytime.

611
01:23:27,845 --> 01:23:29,779
What are you doing? Come out.

612
01:23:38,856 --> 01:23:42,121
Okay. Okay.

613
01:23:44,862 --> 01:23:49,128
Now let's see; who chases whom?

614
01:24:31,842 --> 01:24:34,174
No!

615
01:24:50,861 --> 01:24:52,795
Home sweet home!

616
01:24:53,264 --> 01:24:54,731
Rohan enjoyed the most today.

617
01:24:54,865 --> 01:24:57,060
We should regularly
go on such outings.

618
01:24:58,803 --> 01:25:01,738
Look, he is still smiling
in his sleep.

619
01:25:01,806 --> 01:25:03,740
Even you smile.

620
01:25:03,808 --> 01:25:05,742
Really? But you never
told me about it.

621
01:25:05,810 --> 01:25:07,744
ln fact you laugh out aloud.

622
01:25:07,812 --> 01:25:10,144
Forget it! That's better
than your snoring.

623
01:25:10,281 --> 01:25:12,749
lmpossible! l never snore.

624
01:25:12,817 --> 01:25:16,412
You definitely do. Ask
Radhika. Mr. Dumb!

625
01:25:16,821 --> 01:25:18,755
Radz! Radz.

626
01:25:18,823 --> 01:25:20,757
He is sleeping, dear.

627
01:26:24,288 --> 01:26:25,414
Radz.

628
01:26:44,842 --> 01:26:46,104
Viraag!

629
01:26:54,118 --> 01:26:56,382
What happened?
- There is a man upstairs!

630
01:26:56,787 --> 01:26:58,721
What happened?
- There is man in Radhika's room.

631
01:26:58,789 --> 01:27:00,051
What happened?

632
01:27:20,811 --> 01:27:22,073
No!

633
01:28:28,279 --> 01:28:30,747
Murli. He was Radhika's classmate.

634
01:28:32,082 --> 01:28:34,277
Friend. A very close friend.

635
01:28:35,352 --> 01:28:38,753
Can there be some personal
enmity at college? - Yes.

636
01:28:39,823 --> 01:28:42,087
But.. l feel something else.

637
01:28:43,160 --> 01:28:44,752
What do you mean?

638
01:28:46,163 --> 01:28:48,290
This can be the handiwork of some..

639
01:28:48,365 --> 01:28:50,424
..psychopath or a serial killer.

640
01:28:52,236 --> 01:28:56,366
A person who is very
much mentally ill.

641
01:28:57,775 --> 01:28:59,709
But we'll catch him.

642
01:29:01,779 --> 01:29:05,044
l have deputed two guards
for your security.

643
01:29:05,249 --> 01:29:06,716
Just in case.

644
01:29:42,219 --> 01:29:45,416
Mama, where is Radz?

645
01:29:46,824 --> 01:29:50,760
Rohan, Radz has gone
out for a few days.

646
01:29:50,828 --> 01:29:52,762
She'll soon be back.

647
01:29:52,830 --> 01:29:55,094
But, why is mama crying?

648
01:30:21,125 --> 01:30:22,251
Hello.

649
01:30:22,326 --> 01:30:23,793
Ma'am, l'm calling from the
hospital. - What is it?

650
01:30:23,861 --> 01:30:25,795
There's a case of internal
hemorrhage.

651
01:30:25,863 --> 01:30:27,797
Please, come soon. l'll
come right away.

652
01:30:27,865 --> 01:30:31,460
What happened? There
is an emergency case.

653
01:30:31,869 --> 01:30:33,803
l have to go to the hospital

654
01:30:34,872 --> 01:30:38,467
Rohan, stay with your dad.
- Okay, mama.

655
01:30:52,890 --> 01:30:55,154
Transfer the patient in the lCU.
- Fine.

656
01:31:08,272 --> 01:31:10,433
Run! Go!

657
01:31:10,841 --> 01:31:12,103
Why don't you understand?

658
01:31:12,176 --> 01:31:13,438
Where is he?
- Over there.

659
01:31:13,844 --> 01:31:15,778
Hey! Stop! Stop! Listen to me.

660
01:31:15,846 --> 01:31:17,780
You must listen to me.
- C'mon, get up.

661
01:31:18,849 --> 01:31:20,111
Wait!

662
01:31:20,851 --> 01:31:22,785
He swallowed your sister.

663
01:31:22,853 --> 01:31:25,788
Didn't you see, her eyes
were popping out..

664
01:31:25,856 --> 01:31:28,120
..the tongue was out and she
was hanging nude on the tree.

665
01:31:28,192 --> 01:31:30,786
That tree is not a tree. That
house is not a house.

666
01:31:31,328 --> 01:31:33,455
That killer..

667
01:31:33,864 --> 01:31:35,126
Get in!

668
01:31:35,199 --> 01:31:36,791
Stop! Stop!

669
01:31:38,869 --> 01:31:40,200
Stop!

670
01:31:46,877 --> 01:31:50,813
So you want to say that
ghosts dwell in my house?

671
01:31:51,882 --> 01:31:55,079
My sister was killed..
That banyan tree!

672
01:31:55,819 --> 01:31:57,753
That is not a tree.

673
01:31:58,222 --> 01:32:01,419
Thousands of people came from there.

674
01:32:01,825 --> 01:32:04,293
All were.. corpses.

675
01:32:05,829 --> 01:32:07,160
Who? To whom?

676
01:32:07,231 --> 01:32:09,426
That, Dilip laundryman!

677
01:32:09,833 --> 01:32:11,095
She ran then too..

678
01:32:11,835 --> 01:32:14,770
Who?
- With big ears, like monkeys.

679
01:32:14,838 --> 01:32:16,772
l don't know them. Who?

680
01:32:17,841 --> 01:32:22,107
The daughter of the grocer
she ran away from home.

681
01:32:24,848 --> 01:32:26,110
The temple..

682
01:32:27,851 --> 01:32:30,115
The kids! Manish and Jyoti.

683
01:32:30,854 --> 01:32:34,449
That fair aunty! That master!
That fatty.. fatty..

684
01:32:38,395 --> 01:32:39,794
Who is Manish?

685
01:32:42,866 --> 01:32:44,128
Who is Manish and Jyoti?

686
01:32:44,201 --> 01:32:48,467
Manish and Jyoti are
kids from my school.

687
01:32:49,873 --> 01:32:51,135
They are dead!

688
01:32:51,208 --> 01:32:52,800
The tree swallowed them.

689
01:32:54,811 --> 01:32:57,405
They are dead! The tree
swallowed them.

690
01:33:00,817 --> 01:33:03,285
That was Manish's ball.
Manish did it.

691
01:33:03,353 --> 01:33:05,412
Manish and Jyoti couldn't sleep.

692
01:33:07,424 --> 01:33:09,415
Others live here as well.

693
01:33:26,310 --> 01:33:30,440
Rohan, what happened? What
are you looking at?

694
01:33:37,854 --> 01:33:41,312
Rohan! Rohan! What happened?

695
01:33:55,806 --> 01:33:57,137
Mr. Rao!

696
01:33:58,809 --> 01:34:00,140
Sir!

697
01:34:17,828 --> 01:34:19,762
