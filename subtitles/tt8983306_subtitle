00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,333
Oh, God, no!

5
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:36,500
Dad!

6
00:01:36,583 --> 00:01:38,250
Oh, dear!

7
00:01:40,042 --> 00:01:41,500
Oh, dear!

8
00:01:46,292 --> 00:01:47,625
<i>Breaking news!</i>

9
00:01:47,667 --> 00:01:52,583
<i>High Court Judge Mr. Srinivasan
was shot down and murdered brutally.</i>

10
00:01:52,667 --> 00:01:54,667
<i>Around 5 a.m. this morning,</i>

11
00:01:54,708 --> 00:01:57,542
<i>High Court Judge Mr.Srinivasan,</i>

12
00:01:57,583 --> 00:02:00,875
<i>who had gone for a morning walk,</i>

13
00:02:00,958 --> 00:02:03,792
<i>was treacherously murdered
by strangers at his ECR farm house.</i>

14
00:02:03,875 --> 00:02:06,417
<i>How he was murdered,</i>
who killed him,

15
00:02:06,458 --> 00:02:11,042
<i>or their motive has not been made
clear by the police department.</i>

16
00:02:11,792 --> 00:02:13,542
‐Another dimwit has arrived.

17
00:02:13,625 --> 00:02:15,000
‐Who the hell are you, damn it?
‐Sir!

18
00:02:15,167 --> 00:02:17,125
I'll skin you, damn it.
Throw him outside.

19
00:02:19,792 --> 00:02:21,542
Sir, sir... just a minute, sir.

20
00:02:21,958 --> 00:02:23,500
‐Oh, God.
‐Sir, sir!

21
00:02:23,583 --> 00:02:24,792
There's been
such a tragic incident.

22
00:02:24,833 --> 00:02:26,542
Who is behind this murder?

23
00:02:26,667 --> 00:02:28,292
I have no comments at the moment.

24
00:02:28,542 --> 00:02:29,375
Sir!

25
00:02:35,708 --> 00:02:38,208
We've been waiting for an hour.
Please let us in.

26
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:25,917
<i>The threat message on the judge's
phone, has it been sent for analysis?</i>

27
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:26,958
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

28
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:30,792
<i>The Police Commissioner has been
calling profusely since morning.</i>

29
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:32,292
<i>My ears are bleeding!</i>

30
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:33,958
<i>Didn't I ask you to
find the murderer?</i>

31
00:03:34,458 --> 00:03:36,083
<i>Locate the severed head
of the deceased.</i>

32
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:38,792
<i>Sir, we're trying our level best.</i>

33
00:03:55,792 --> 00:03:59,208
Dear viewers, welcome to our show.

34
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:00,917
<i>If this is the state
of a High Court judge,</i>

35
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,542
<i>then how do we expect them
to keep the public safe?</i>

36
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:08,608
<i>Until we get rid of
this corrupt government,</i>

37
00:04:08,642 --> 00:04:10,792
<i>the safety of the public
will be at stake.</i>

38
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:11,917
<i>That's my opinion.</i>

39
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:15,208
<i>Can we count Chennai
among the safest cities?</i>

40
00:04:15,292 --> 00:04:17,916
<i>We'll debate this matter
after a short break.</i>

41
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:59,667
They're tearing us apart in TV,
magazines, newspapers and debates.

42
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:03,167
<i>I'll do one thing and
transfer this case to CB‐CID.</i>

43
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:05,042
<i>Sir, please give us 10 more days.</i>

44
00:05:05,167 --> 00:05:07,292
<i>We will get it solved. Trust us.</i>

OFFICE OF THE COMMISSIONER
CHENNAI

46
00:05:18,292 --> 00:05:22,417
Sir, the murder happened
around 5:30‐5:40 a.m.

47
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,500
Totally, 4 bullets were fired.

48
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:27,750
All the bullets have
an in‐and‐out point.

49
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:30,375
But we couldn't find any bullets
at the crime scene.

50
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,417
The peculiar and most confusing
aspect about it is that

51
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,292
the 4 bullets were fired
from 2 different guns.

52
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:39,792
The bullets on the left chest
are from an 8 mm.

53
00:05:39,917 --> 00:05:41,375
A Raven type gun.

54
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,542
But the bullets on the right side
of the chest

55
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:45,583
were fired from an untraceable gun.

56
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:49,000
Post that, the murderer used
a surgical knife to sever the head.

57
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:51,083
It's a peculiar case
in recent history.

58
00:05:51,792 --> 00:05:54,333
Sir, the judge was running
a business on the side.

59
00:05:54,417 --> 00:05:58,667
A red colour car was spotted
at the time of the murder.

60
00:05:59,917 --> 00:06:01,083
Other than that,

61
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:02,917
we don't have any other clue.

62
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,209
This was already explained on TV
better than you people.

63
00:06:06,667 --> 00:06:08,000
Tell me something different.

64
00:06:08,708 --> 00:06:10,458
We need to close this case
immediately.

65
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,542
Sorry to interrupt, sir.

66
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:15,458
ACP Pon Manickavel from Salem
is a great gun specialist.

67
00:06:17,583 --> 00:06:19,212
<i>Moreover,
he holds 5th rank</i>

68
00:06:19,246 --> 00:06:20,955
<i>in the All‐India Range
Firing competition.</i>

69
00:06:21,042 --> 00:06:24,708
<i>In 2012, the goverment selected
and sent him for IDA training.</i>

70
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:25,875
<i>He even won a gold medal
over there.</i>

71
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:28,583
<i>He's smart, brilliant and honest.</i>

72
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:30,875
<i>And he's extremely focused
in his duty.</i>

73
00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:34,083
If we speak to him,
we might get a clue in this case.

74
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:35,292
Then just call him.

75
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,500
Okay, sir.

76
00:06:45,833 --> 00:06:47,792
‐ <i>Hello.</i>
‐Manickavel.

77
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:49,458
This is Commissioner Bala Murugan.

78
00:06:49,708 --> 00:06:51,042
<i>Hi, sir, how are you?</i>

79
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:53,918
‐I'm good. How are you?
<i>‐I'm doing very well.</i>

80
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:55,167
Manickavel...

81
00:06:55,417 --> 00:06:57,958
did you hear about High Court Judge
Srinivasan's murder?

82
00:06:58,125 --> 00:06:59,167
<i>I did, sir.</i>

83
00:06:59,292 --> 00:07:01,292
<i>That's the only news on TV
since 2 days.</i>

84
00:07:01,542 --> 00:07:02,958
It's very complicated.

85
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,250
There are exit wounds,
but we couldn't find any bullets.

86
00:07:06,417 --> 00:07:07,250
<i>It's simple, sir.</i>

87
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,458
<i>Every bullet fired from a gun,</i>

88
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:13,875
<i>their exit distance can be calculated
leaving the body.</i>

89
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:15,500
<i>Sigma Shooting Technology.</i>

90
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:18,000
<i>An expert will collect the bullets
after its exit.</i>

91
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,750
Manickavel, is this possible?

92
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,375
<i>It's possible for the person
who knows the trick.</i>

93
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:25,458
‐Okay, thank you, Manickavel.
<i>‐Thank you, sir.</i>

94
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:28,980
I think he's the right person
for this case.

95
00:07:29,014 --> 00:07:30,042
Let's hand it over to him.

96
00:07:31,042 --> 00:07:32,917
Sir, but there's a small problem.

97
00:07:33,417 --> 00:07:35,917
Six months ago,
while he was investigating

98
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:37,708
<i>a sensational case in Salem...</i>

99
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:54,292
Such a rank holder!

100
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:56,042
What are you going to do
after quitting this job?

101
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,833
I'm going to herd cattle.

102
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:14,125
My instinct says
he's the right person for this case.

103
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:15,875
You better convince him.

104
00:08:15,917 --> 00:08:17,750
Also make him understand
the importance of this case.

105
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,208
He's a police officer too.

106
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:20,542
He'll definitely understand.

107
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:23,000
We're meeting him tomorrow, okay?

108
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:48,501
Hello, sir.

109
00:08:48,542 --> 00:08:49,875
‐Welcome, Manickavel.
‐Sir.

110
00:08:50,292 --> 00:08:51,292
Please come.

111
00:08:52,042 --> 00:08:53,042
Okay, fine.

112
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,208
Sir, this is Mr. Manickavel.

113
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:58,208
‐Sir!
‐Welcome, Manickavel.

114
00:08:58,833 --> 00:08:59,833
Sit.

115
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,417
Balamurugan spoke about you.

116
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,500
‐Impressive track records.
‐Thank you, sir.

117
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:05,208
We're under immense pressure.

118
00:09:05,292 --> 00:09:07,292
You have to solve
this case quickly.

119
00:09:07,917 --> 00:09:08,917
Okay. sir.

120
00:09:08,917 --> 00:09:11,083
I want full freedom in this case.

121
00:09:11,417 --> 00:09:13,333
There will be
no political interference.

122
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:14,417
I personally assure you.

123
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:17,000
I'll take care
of the political interference.

124
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:19,917
I don't want any disturbance
from our department.

125
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:22,125
I will be myself.

126
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,167
Okay, Manickavel, go ahead.

127
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:30,375
Chidambaram will introduce you
to the special team.

128
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:31,708
‐Good luck.
‐Thank you, sir.

129
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:35,667
Hey, didn't you join the force
through recommendation?

130
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,250
How did you manage to get
into the special team?

131
00:09:37,708 --> 00:09:39,083
Obviously, special recommendation.

132
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,625
‐Sir!
‐Good morning, sir!

133
00:09:46,792 --> 00:09:48,167
He's Inspector Peruvalathan.

134
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:50,625
He's been following this case
since the beginning.

135
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:52,125
He'll be very helpful to you.

136
00:09:52,167 --> 00:09:53,167
Very smart.

137
00:09:53,292 --> 00:09:55,042
He's equal to 10 people.

138
00:09:55,667 --> 00:09:57,250
He's Inspector Nandakumar.

139
00:09:57,917 --> 00:09:59,750
He assisted in
the Tindivanam murder case.

140
00:10:00,417 --> 00:10:01,417
He's Inspector Rajagopal.

141
00:10:01,417 --> 00:10:03,083
For now, I just need two officers.

142
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:06,000
Sir, 10 people from this team

143
00:10:06,042 --> 00:10:07,208
have been suggested
by the Commissioner.

144
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:08,333
For what?

145
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:10,500
I thought he's equal to 10 men.

146
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,333
You two follow me.

147
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:15,792
Damn, they ditched us.

148
00:10:16,167 --> 00:10:18,292
Looks like special recommendation
got jacked.

149
00:10:19,167 --> 00:10:21,833
Sir, the judge used to wake up
at 5:30 a.m. every day.

150
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Yoga and meditation at 6:45 a.m.,

151
00:10:24,167 --> 00:10:26,208
then, at 7 a.m.,
he goes off to play tennis.

152
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:29,000
Later, he goes for a walk
on the beach.

153
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:30,375
‐And then‐‐
‐What did you say your name was?

154
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:31,542
Peruvalathan.

155
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:33,833
Shall we continue
after a cup of tea?

156
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:34,709
Sir?

157
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:35,958
I'll freshen up and speak to you.

158
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:43,083
Sir.

159
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:48,958
Peruvalathan, sir.

160
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:51,583
Oh... that's good.

161
00:10:55,167 --> 00:10:57,000
‐This tea sucks.
‐Sir?

162
00:10:57,292 --> 00:10:59,875
Can't you find a good place
for tea?

163
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:08,708
Just being muscled
like Baahubali isn't enough.

164
00:11:10,292 --> 00:11:12,042
Try to attain his wisdom too.

165
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:16,833
Sir, we're getting late to leave
for the judge's residence.

166
00:11:17,583 --> 00:11:18,583
Hey...

167
00:11:18,792 --> 00:11:21,917
we're going there to convey
our condolences, not to save him.

168
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:23,250
We can get there at our leisure.

169
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:24,792
Sir?

170
00:11:28,292 --> 00:11:29,833
‐Special recommendation?
‐Yes, sir.

171
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:33,333
Settle the bill for this.

172
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,458
This is new.
The department is not used to this.

173
00:11:42,542 --> 00:11:45,042
‐Hey, hey. Follow us.
‐Okay, sir.

174
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:55,125
‐Tell me, Anbu.
‐Where are you?

175
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:56,291
I'm heading to the crime scene.

176
00:11:56,292 --> 00:11:58,583
Oh, you're with an accused?
Sorry, I'll call you later.

177
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:02,833
Dear, it's our Inspector.

178
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:04,708
‐What is your name?
‐Peruvalathan.

179
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:07,042
‐Peru...
‐Peruvalathan!

180
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,042
It's Baahubali.

181
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:13,625
Fine, get home soon.

182
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:14,750
<i>Bye.</i>

183
00:12:27,042 --> 00:12:29,750
Why there are so many people here,
like it's a gathering?

184
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:31,875
Clear the area.

185
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:34,417
Sir, sir, they're here
for our investigation

186
00:12:34,542 --> 00:12:37,917
They've been taking our lives
in the name of investigation.

187
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:40,375
‐What did you say?
‐Nothing, sir.

188
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:42,292
‐What did you say, damn it?
‐Sir, I didn't say anything.

189
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:43,792
Hey, Baahubali!

190
00:12:44,042 --> 00:12:46,500
Why are you getting worked up?
Ask everyone to leave.

191
00:12:46,917 --> 00:12:49,000
Sir, we'll take their phone numbers
and Aadhar cards at least.

192
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:50,875
Why don't you take
their passports too?

193
00:12:50,917 --> 00:12:51,835
Sir?

194
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:54,958
I've arrived without GPS.
Hope I'm at the right place.

195
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,667
[recites holy chants]

196
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:03,958
Scene of the crime!

197
00:13:04,167 --> 00:13:06,417
I'm gonna photograph
the evidence

198
00:13:06,542 --> 00:13:09,542
so that I'll get promoted sooner.

199
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,750
Sir, the judge used to go
for a walk here every day.

200
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:20,792
On the left corner, he used to
do yoga and meditation.

201
00:13:20,917 --> 00:13:22,750
What's the price of the land
over here?

202
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:24,542
‐Sir?
‐Ma!

203
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:29,167
Sir. Sorry, sir.

204
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:31,500
Sir, I was trying to photograph
vital evidence.

205
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:33,667
Thought it might be useful to us.

206
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:36,500
I was going to create
a WhatsApp group and share.

207
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:40,167
I was thinking of nabbing the accused
as soon as possible.

208
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,708
Bloody hell,
I'm stuck with numbskulls.

209
00:13:51,708 --> 00:13:53,042
<i>‐Mr. Baahubali.</i>
‐Sir.

210
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:54,250
<i>We're done with the investigation
for the day.</i>

211
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,917
<i>You can leave.
We'll meet tomorrow.</i>

212
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:58,917
Thank goodness I took my bike.

213
00:14:21,417 --> 00:14:25,333
How long have you planned
to sleep hugging a book?

214
00:14:25,917 --> 00:14:28,583
Why would I hug a book
once the exams are over?

215
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:30,875
Fine. I wasn't home yesterday.

216
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:32,167
Did you miss me?

217
00:14:32,792 --> 00:14:35,917
You're right. If our parents were
here, it would've been better.

218
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:42,333
Sir has rejoined duty
after a long gap.

219
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:43,750
Didn't you miss anyone?

220
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:51,667
Shall I give you an idea
so that we don't miss each other?

221
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:55,167
An average‐looking
mini Anbarasi like you.

222
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:56,168
What?

223
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:59,292
And an awesome mini Manickavel
like me.

224
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:00,250
Oh!

225
00:15:00,792 --> 00:15:02,125
Shall we prep for it?

226
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:05,042
‐The plan sounds good though...
‐Thank you.

227
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:07,458
...but can be executed
only after the exams.

228
00:15:07,917 --> 00:15:09,458
Didn't you mention the same
last year too?

229
00:15:09,667 --> 00:15:11,542
Is it? I forgot about that.

230
00:15:12,042 --> 00:15:14,708
You better leave for work
right now.

231
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:24,458
He worked as a driver at
the judge's residence for 15 years.

232
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,833
Now he works here.

233
00:15:26,542 --> 00:15:28,000
If we interrogate him...

234
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:32,333
Come on!

235
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:40,000
Sir, that's him.

236
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:42,958
Brother!

237
00:15:44,417 --> 00:15:45,583
Others can continue
with their work.

238
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:54,000
‐Sir, I have nothing to do with it.
‐Shall we have a tea?

239
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,625
I'll get it right away, sir.

240
00:15:55,792 --> 00:15:57,417
‐Name?
‐Narasimhan.

241
00:16:02,042 --> 00:16:04,250
When was the last time
you saw the judge?

242
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:05,833
‐Tell me, dear.
‐Hello!

243
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:07,875
How was the dosa?

244
00:16:07,917 --> 00:16:09,208
How... was the dosa?

245
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:10,875
You're asking me this now?

246
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,875
Obviously! You left
without saying anything.

247
00:16:13,042 --> 00:16:14,417
Do you think this is a house
or a restaurant?

248
00:16:16,917 --> 00:16:18,208
I'll make you starve tonight.

249
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:19,958
Bloody idiot! I'm break your teeth.

250
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:22,125
Hey, Baahubali! Hey!

251
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:25,083
Sir, when I questioned,
he's being arrogant.

252
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:27,833
Sir, I was right with my replies.

253
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:30,125
But he's beating me out of spite.

254
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:31,500
How dare you tell on me?

255
00:16:33,167 --> 00:16:35,125
Go... go and check
if the tea is ready.

256
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:36,126
Go!

257
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:38,625
Sir, come on.
Sir, please come. Let's go.

258
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:43,167
‐Take this.
‐I don't want it, sir.

259
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:46,125
‐You're bleeding.
‐Sir, your tea.

260
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:49,958
Come on, have this.

261
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:52,625
‐Damn it!
‐Sir, don't get angry.

262
00:16:52,917 --> 00:16:56,333
If they had given me 2 more days,
I would've solved the case.

263
00:16:57,917 --> 00:16:59,250
He's totally useless.

264
00:16:59,292 --> 00:17:00,750
‐Sir, don't get worked up.
‐Damn!

265
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:02,542
How long have you been working?

266
00:17:02,667 --> 00:17:04,083
It's been 6 months, sir.

267
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:06,709
‐Sir, I don't want.
‐Take it.

268
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,041
Hey, what the hell is he doing?

269
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:10,000
Sir, I don't want it.
Sir, please listen to me.

270
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:11,333
‐Sir, please I don't need it.
‐For medical expenses.

271
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:12,708
Sir, be patient.

272
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:18,958
‐My ill fate I'm stuck with him.
‐Sir!

273
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:23,583
Advocate Ramachandran
is the judge's close friend.

274
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,625
He never does anything
without his consent.

275
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,166
‐Do you know the address?
‐Yes, I do.

276
00:17:30,292 --> 00:17:31,375
‐Nanda.
‐Sir!

277
00:17:32,333 --> 00:17:33,333
Okay, sir.

278
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:35,208
Give me the address.

279
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:12,000
Manickavel, sir,
if we deal this case in your style,

280
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:13,250
it will never work out.

281
00:18:13,667 --> 00:18:14,875
I will tell you frankly, sir.

282
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:18,042
Someone about to confess
will defer due to your methods.

283
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:20,333
I don't mind
even if you take me wrong.

284
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:24,917
I did get offended.
You stay right here.

285
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:33,250
No, I didn't meet the judge
that day.

286
00:18:49,708 --> 00:18:51,500
Sir. Sir, sir, I'm coming.

287
00:18:59,667 --> 00:19:02,500
<i>You should ask Inspector Rathnavel
for personal information.</i>

288
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:03,625
1927...

289
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,542
1927...

290
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:09,917
I'm slogging here for the exams,
and you're sleeping peacefully.

291
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:13,083
You should keep your mind relaxed
a day before the exam.

292
00:19:13,167 --> 00:19:14,167
Don't touch the books.

293
00:19:14,167 --> 00:19:15,500
Come on, come over here.

294
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:17,750
‐Come closer.
‐Let go of my hand. You're always...

295
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:20,958
I can't remember these years
and events.

296
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:22,083
Is that so?

297
00:19:23,542 --> 00:19:25,125
Fine,
tell me when is my birthday.

298
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:26,208
April 3rd.

299
00:19:26,667 --> 00:19:28,250
Tell me what we did on that day?

300
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,917
We both went to Vinayagar Temple
on that day.

301
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,906
I was wearing a blue sari;

302
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:35,167
you wore a black shirt
and white pants.

303
00:19:35,292 --> 00:19:36,625
After that?

304
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:38,292
After which, we had ice cream.

305
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:39,375
I remember everything.

306
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,500
‐How's that?
‐That's because...

307
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:43,250
I like you very much.

308
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,042
Like what you study.

309
00:19:47,792 --> 00:19:49,458
It's fine to study what you like,

310
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:53,417
but how to remember Partition of
Bengal and Simon Commission?

311
00:19:54,917 --> 00:19:55,917
What are you doing?

312
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:57,875
Simon Commission.

313
00:19:58,583 --> 00:20:00,208
1927.

314
00:20:04,042 --> 00:20:05,208
Simon Commission.

315
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,917
1927!

316
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:08,625
What about Partition of Bengal?

317
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,500
This is Bengal, and this is India.

318
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:12,208
It's 1905.

319
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,792
1905, Partition of Bengal.

320
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,875
Oh, God.

321
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:23,208
Now what do I assign to this?

322
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,958
India's atom bomb tragedy.

323
00:20:26,042 --> 00:20:28,917
Ah, 1974...

324
00:20:29,792 --> 00:20:32,042
Are you really prepping me
for the exam?

325
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:33,583
Of course, dear. Come here.

326
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:36,875
‐In 1974...
‐But there are more events.

327
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,292
We have more places to cover.

Simon Commission.

Ah, Bhopal. IIT inauguration.

365
00:24:07,917 --> 00:24:09,208
Ah, Emergency.

366
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,833
India's atom bomb tragedy.

Kargil War.

368
00:24:13,292 --> 00:24:15,375
I know where you're headed.

369
00:24:15,625 --> 00:24:17,542
You go to your office,
and I'll go for my exams.

370
00:24:17,625 --> 00:24:18,750
‐Okay.
‐Bye.

371
00:24:52,583 --> 00:24:53,833
Why aren't you at work?

372
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:02,833
Sir, this is Peruvalathan.

373
00:25:02,875 --> 00:25:04,500
I have that Royapuram Ravi
over here.

374
00:25:04,542 --> 00:25:05,917
I'm out with my wife
for an important work

375
00:25:05,917 --> 00:25:06,958
I'll call you later.

376
00:25:10,333 --> 00:25:12,292
Being around his wife...

377
00:25:13,083 --> 00:25:14,458
seems to be an important work.

378
00:25:15,458 --> 00:25:16,667
He doesn't have to come over.

379
00:25:16,833 --> 00:25:18,042
‐I'm gonna question him myself.
‐Sir, sir, sir...

380
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:19,750
Sir, why do you want to risk it?

381
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:20,875
Let's wait for him to come.

382
00:25:21,042 --> 00:25:22,583
As if he's going to do anything.

383
00:25:23,583 --> 00:25:25,250
We'll nab them
with great difficulty...

384
00:25:25,375 --> 00:25:29,208
but when he arrives, we'll start
talking only after cup of tea.

385
00:25:29,792 --> 00:25:33,208
‐Watch how I'm gonna handle this.
‐Sir, please wait.

386
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,333
Tell me.

387
00:25:39,625 --> 00:25:42,875
Sir, it's not a big deal to lease
a shop at the fish market.

388
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:44,667
I hacked one guy's hand over there.

389
00:25:44,792 --> 00:25:45,781
The judge witnessed that incident

390
00:25:45,815 --> 00:25:47,000
and locked me up
with a non‐bailable warrant.

391
00:25:47,292 --> 00:25:49,583
I got pissed off,
so I threatened to kill him.

392
00:25:49,583 --> 00:25:51,708
Otherwise, I have
nothing to do with this case.

393
00:25:54,208 --> 00:25:56,375
Fine, looks like
you didn't find the guy.

394
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:59,500
I wonder what kind of investigation
you guys carry out.

395
00:25:59,583 --> 00:26:01,167
Hey, how dare you?

396
00:26:01,375 --> 00:26:03,542
Do you think the police are a joke?

397
00:26:03,667 --> 00:26:04,838
Sir, don't raise your hand
for no reason.

398
00:26:04,872 --> 00:26:06,042
It won't turn out good.

399
00:26:06,083 --> 00:26:07,083
What do you mean?

400
00:26:07,333 --> 00:26:09,083
What do you mean by that,
damn it?

401
00:26:09,208 --> 00:26:10,833
Come on, tell me, damn it!

402
00:26:10,875 --> 00:26:12,542
Tell me what will go wrong.

403
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:14,917
‐Tell me, damn it.
‐Sir, don't hit me.

404
00:26:21,083 --> 00:26:22,792
‐Hey, I'm gonna‐‐
‐Sir, please don't.

405
00:26:22,875 --> 00:26:24,833
Sir, I sent it on our WhatsApp group
by mistake.

406
00:26:24,875 --> 00:26:25,875
Give it to me.

407
00:26:26,375 --> 00:26:27,625
Sir, don't hit me. Sir!

408
00:26:28,708 --> 00:26:30,250
‐Hey!
‐Hey!

409
00:26:31,292 --> 00:26:33,167
What are you doing?
Take your hands off him.

410
00:26:33,875 --> 00:26:34,875
Out.

411
00:26:35,167 --> 00:26:36,167
Get out!

412
00:26:39,958 --> 00:26:42,792
Don't you dare touch anyone
in regards to this case anymore.

413
00:26:48,583 --> 00:26:50,417
They brought in cattle herder

414
00:26:51,042 --> 00:26:52,792
and expect him to solve a case.

415
00:26:55,167 --> 00:26:57,083
I'm gonna resign from this team.

416
00:26:58,042 --> 00:26:59,167
To hell with everyone.

417
00:27:05,917 --> 00:27:06,625
Hello!

418
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,458
Sir, is Peruvalathan at the station?

419
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:09,792
I am his wife.

420
00:27:09,875 --> 00:27:11,250
Peruvalathan sir left long ago.

421
00:27:11,458 --> 00:27:13,208
<i>Sir, he was supposed to pick up
our daughter from school.</i>

422
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:14,583
Sir, his wife is on the phone.

423
00:27:14,792 --> 00:27:16,375
<i>I have no clue what happened.</i>

424
00:27:16,542 --> 00:27:17,875
<i>I've been trying to call him
for a very long time.</i>

425
00:27:17,917 --> 00:27:19,250
Tell me, madam.
This is the DC speaking.

426
00:27:19,292 --> 00:27:21,625
Sir, he said will be picking up
our daughter from school.

427
00:27:21,667 --> 00:27:22,833
<i>It's been two hours.</i>

428
00:27:22,875 --> 00:27:24,583
He hasn't returned yet.
I tried calling his phone.

429
00:27:24,625 --> 00:27:26,583
It's ringing,
but he isn't answering.

430
00:27:26,708 --> 00:27:29,251
<i>I don't know what to do now.
I'm really scared, sir.</i>

431
00:27:29,292 --> 00:27:31,750
It's nothing.
I've sent him on an errand.

432
00:27:32,042 --> 00:27:33,250
He'll be home anytime.

433
00:27:39,375 --> 00:27:42,333
Don't you dare touch anyone
in regards to this case anymore.

434
00:27:42,625 --> 00:27:44,833
Hey, how dare you
lay your hands on me?

435
00:27:44,958 --> 00:27:46,000
I'll make sure you pay for it.

436
00:27:56,917 --> 00:27:58,500
Daddy!

437
00:28:00,458 --> 00:28:01,750
Daddy!

438
00:28:01,958 --> 00:28:04,458
Uncle, please don't beat up my dad.

439
00:28:05,625 --> 00:28:07,250
Please, uncle!

440
00:28:09,042 --> 00:28:11,250
Brother, a police officer
beat me up.

441
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:13,167
We should make him pay for it.

442
00:28:17,375 --> 00:28:18,583
Daddy!

443
00:28:18,667 --> 00:28:21,042
Please don't beat my dad.

444
00:28:22,583 --> 00:28:23,958
Daddy!

445
00:28:24,375 --> 00:28:25,875
Daddy!

446
00:28:28,708 --> 00:28:30,583
Daddy...

447
00:28:30,958 --> 00:28:31,625
Daddy.

448
00:28:31,667 --> 00:28:33,958
Isn't this the hand
that touched my brother?

449
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:37,417
Give that to me.

450
00:28:37,625 --> 00:28:39,792
Oh, no! Please let my dad go.

451
00:28:39,917 --> 00:28:43,750
Hereafter, they'll think twice before
laying their hands on Royapuram's men.

452
00:29:07,167 --> 00:29:08,167
Hey!

453
00:29:08,417 --> 00:29:11,042
This conflict is between brothers.
You better leave!

454
00:29:17,375 --> 00:29:20,708
Everyone in the department
is like a brother to me.

455
00:29:24,958 --> 00:29:26,250
You keep playing over here.

456
00:29:26,583 --> 00:29:28,500
Uncle will play for a while too.

457
00:29:43,333 --> 00:29:45,250
Uncle! Uncle!

458
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:59,542
Inspector Marikattan

459
00:31:59,625 --> 00:32:02,042
Adhiyaman Peruvalathan.

460
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:04,542
Daddy, Daddy.

461
00:32:05,833 --> 00:32:07,792
Is it hurting too much, Dad?

462
00:32:07,917 --> 00:32:09,458
Nothing to worry about, dear.

463
00:32:10,958 --> 00:32:16,458
A police officer should know
when to fight and when to be calm.

464
00:32:16,958 --> 00:32:17,958
Sir.

465
00:32:21,208 --> 00:32:22,667
‐Peruvalathan.
‐Sir.

466
00:32:22,958 --> 00:32:26,167
Should a police officer
work for the department?

467
00:32:26,333 --> 00:32:27,833
Or work for the public?

468
00:32:27,917 --> 00:32:30,292
Sir, isn't both the same?

469
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:32,333
There's a huge difference.

470
00:32:32,875 --> 00:32:35,250
‐I don't understand.
‐You'll understand eventually.

471
00:32:36,917 --> 00:32:39,208
OFFICE OF THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER
CHENNAI

472
00:32:40,292 --> 00:32:41,292
Sir!

473
00:32:43,667 --> 00:32:45,833
Who are we meeting today,
Peruvalathan?

474
00:32:45,875 --> 00:32:48,000
‐Wait, hold on.
‐What's up with him?

475
00:32:48,917 --> 00:32:50,417
Let's discuss it over tea.

476
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:01,417
‐Fantastic tea!
‐Thank you, sir.

477
00:33:02,458 --> 00:33:04,708
Only now you've come to my terms,
Peruvalathan.

478
00:33:05,583 --> 00:33:08,583
Sir, you can continue
calling me Baahubali.

479
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:14,750
Fine...

480
00:33:15,708 --> 00:33:19,958
that advocate mentioned about
an Inspector Rathnavel the other day.

481
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:21,250
Yes.

482
00:33:24,375 --> 00:33:25,500
Shall we meet him?

483
00:33:45,542 --> 00:33:46,958
Why is the door locked?

484
00:33:48,208 --> 00:33:49,208
‐Hey, Muthu.
‐Yes, sir.

485
00:33:49,208 --> 00:33:50,917
Give our number
to the granny next door.

486
00:33:50,958 --> 00:33:52,708
‐Ask her to call when he is home.
‐Okay, sir.

487
00:33:58,833 --> 00:34:01,042
Sir, this is Inspector Rathnavel.

488
00:34:01,125 --> 00:34:03,417
I was told you came home to see me.
What is the matter, sir?

489
00:34:03,667 --> 00:34:05,292
Nothing much.
Just a general inquiry.

490
00:34:05,375 --> 00:34:06,375
Are you free to meet?

491
00:34:06,458 --> 00:34:09,375
I'm a little busy
with personal work.

492
00:34:09,417 --> 00:34:11,708
‐Let's meet tomorrow. No problem.
<i>‐Thank you, sir.</i>

493
00:34:12,917 --> 00:34:16,208
Just for a day's fun,
I have to beg you the entire week.

494
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:17,750
‐Playing hardball?
‐Yes.

495
00:34:42,458 --> 00:34:44,375
Shalu, let's meet tomorrow.

496
00:34:44,417 --> 00:34:46,375
‐What happened?
‐Please let's meet tomorrow.

497
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:47,418
Go.

498
00:34:55,625 --> 00:34:57,209
What is it, Rathnavel?
Why are you calling back?

499
00:34:57,250 --> 00:35:00,083
I got a threatening message
from an unknown number.

500
00:35:00,583 --> 00:35:03,708
‐What is the message?
‐It says, "Enjoy your last hour."

501
00:35:03,833 --> 00:35:06,042
Sir, I'm really scared.

502
00:35:06,167 --> 00:35:08,125
You're a policeman.
Don't be scared.

503
00:35:08,375 --> 00:35:10,958
‐Where are you?
‐I'm at Hotel Pallazzio.

504
00:35:11,208 --> 00:35:13,167
Okay, stay right there.
I will come.

505
00:35:29,625 --> 00:35:30,875
Rathnavel, where are you?

506
00:35:30,958 --> 00:35:32,375
I'm heading
towards the parking lot.

507
00:35:32,542 --> 00:35:33,917
Okay, I'll be right there.

508
00:35:35,625 --> 00:35:36,625
Sir, where are you?

509
00:35:36,625 --> 00:35:39,208
I'm heading towards the parking lot.
Come soon.

510
00:35:45,583 --> 00:35:46,501
Sir!

511
00:35:50,125 --> 00:35:53,375
‐Not able to reach him.
‐Sir, look over there.

512
00:36:37,667 --> 00:36:38,750
Peruvalathan!

513
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:41,208
Sir, I am okay, sir.

514
00:36:41,333 --> 00:36:42,333
I am okay.

515
00:37:04,417 --> 00:37:05,583
What's happening, Manickavel?

516
00:37:05,667 --> 00:37:07,917
We never got a resolution
in the judge's murder.

517
00:37:08,042 --> 00:37:10,208
Now a second murder.
That too from our department.

518
00:37:10,333 --> 00:37:11,542
Do you think there's a connection
between these murders?

519
00:37:11,625 --> 00:37:12,958
I don't think so, sir.

520
00:37:13,417 --> 00:37:16,542
These two murders were done
by two different people.

521
00:37:16,917 --> 00:37:19,250
Manickavel,
I hope you understand the pressure.

522
00:37:19,458 --> 00:37:21,042
‐Higher officials‐‐
‐Sir, I need more time.

523
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:23,292
I'll submit a clear report.

524
00:37:24,292 --> 00:37:25,669
Sir, if the murderer made his kill

525
00:37:25,703 --> 00:37:27,417
despite the fact
that we're going to be here,

526
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:29,708
I'm sure there's a link between
the judge's murder and this.

527
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:34,083
Both were done by different people.

528
00:37:34,167 --> 00:37:37,167
No, sir, I think
it's the same person.

529
00:37:37,333 --> 00:37:38,500
I think he has been following us.

530
00:37:38,583 --> 00:37:41,292
Sir, that too during the bomb blast
those 3 and 1/2 minutes,

531
00:37:41,333 --> 00:37:45,333
all CCTV cameras on the floor
were hacked to run in a loop.

532
00:37:46,875 --> 00:37:50,209
‐Analyse Rathnavel's phone.
‐Sure, sir. Right away.

533
00:37:52,542 --> 00:37:55,167
‐Have you recovered the files?
‐Yes, we've recovered it.

534
00:37:55,208 --> 00:37:56,375
‐Good.
‐Thank you, sir.

535
00:37:56,833 --> 00:37:58,417
But something
is seriously wrong, sir.

536
00:37:58,708 --> 00:38:01,583
Someone has used this mobile phone
48 hours ago.

537
00:38:01,792 --> 00:38:03,625
And they've stolen the data
from it.

538
00:38:03,708 --> 00:38:05,625
Can you trace the device
on which it was copied?

539
00:38:05,792 --> 00:38:06,792
Sure, sir.

540
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,792
It's Sony Vaio, 2015 model.

541
00:38:09,958 --> 00:38:11,000
IP address?

542
00:38:20,417 --> 00:38:22,208
<i>Sir, we got his house address
from the IP address.</i>

543
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,333
It's an independent house
at KK Nagar 2nd Street.

544
00:38:24,458 --> 00:38:26,833
You take the force along.
I'm on my way.

545
00:39:01,042 --> 00:39:02,042
Freeze!

546
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,042
Sir, he's not budging.

547
00:39:24,375 --> 00:39:26,667
Sir, when we were inquiring
at the travel agency,

548
00:39:26,917 --> 00:39:28,667
I saw him following us.

549
00:39:29,625 --> 00:39:31,083
It's not only at the agency.

550
00:39:32,458 --> 00:39:33,500
<i>Tea shop.</i>

551
00:39:33,917 --> 00:39:35,000
<i>The judge's house.</i>

552
00:39:35,583 --> 00:39:36,917
<i>The inspector's house.</i>

553
00:39:39,875 --> 00:39:42,500
You've been following us
everywhere.

554
00:39:45,167 --> 00:39:47,125
I know
that you're not the murderer.

555
00:39:47,917 --> 00:39:48,917
Tell me.

556
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:53,542
Sir, sir, sir... sir

557
00:39:53,625 --> 00:39:55,083
Hey, get lost!

558
00:39:55,292 --> 00:39:56,792
‐Sir, sir...
‐Out!

559
00:39:59,958 --> 00:40:00,958
Sir!

560
00:40:03,125 --> 00:40:04,125
Sir.

561
00:40:04,958 --> 00:40:05,958
Hey!

562
00:40:06,292 --> 00:40:08,125
He's belongs to our department too.

563
00:40:08,333 --> 00:40:09,375
Undercover.

564
00:40:10,333 --> 00:40:12,125
He's dealing with the same case.

565
00:40:13,208 --> 00:40:15,917
Buy him tea,
and tell him I apologised...

566
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,042
and relieve him.

567
00:40:17,625 --> 00:40:19,042
‐Did you see that?
‐Yes, sir.

568
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:21,250
Our men don't trust us.

569
00:40:21,333 --> 00:40:22,917
It's that police instinct.

570
00:40:23,625 --> 00:40:25,917
Sorry, you don't look
like a police officer.

571
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,417
‐That's why he's an undercover cop.
‐Shut up!

572
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:32,583
I met the DGP last evening.

573
00:40:32,667 --> 00:40:33,833
Morning, sir.

574
00:40:34,292 --> 00:40:36,125
Manickavel, meet Mr. Kailash.

575
00:40:36,208 --> 00:40:37,208
Undercover unit.

576
00:40:37,458 --> 00:40:38,583
We met already, sir.

577
00:40:39,792 --> 00:40:40,792
Yes, sir.

578
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:43,333
As it's a high‐profile case,

579
00:40:43,375 --> 00:40:45,917
few things were decided by
the higher‐ups without our knowledge.

580
00:40:45,958 --> 00:40:47,000
I hope you understand.

581
00:40:47,417 --> 00:40:48,417
Tell me, Kailash.

582
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:50,500
Sir.

583
00:40:51,208 --> 00:40:54,167
These pictures were hacked
from Rathnavel's phone.

584
00:40:54,625 --> 00:40:57,250
The third person in this picture
is Arjun K. Maran.

585
00:40:57,917 --> 00:40:59,209
He's a successful businessman.

586
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:02,625
He might have something to do
with these murders.

587
00:41:02,833 --> 00:41:05,250
Maybe he is the next target.

588
00:41:06,042 --> 00:41:07,875
So, if we question him personally,

589
00:41:08,292 --> 00:41:10,667
it will help us to take this case
to the next level.

590
00:41:10,792 --> 00:41:12,167
So, then contact him immediately.

591
00:41:12,333 --> 00:41:13,792
We did try contacting him...

592
00:41:13,917 --> 00:41:15,167
but right now he's in Germany.

593
00:41:15,333 --> 00:41:16,583
So, what's next?

594
00:41:16,917 --> 00:41:18,250
He'll be back on Monday.

595
00:41:18,542 --> 00:41:20,208
‐We'll talk to him in person.
‐Okay.

596
00:41:25,583 --> 00:41:29,000
Sir, you haven't been handling
this case with seriousness.

597
00:41:29,417 --> 00:41:31,917
What I meant is
you're serious about it...

598
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,583
but if you handle it more seriously,
it'll be better.

599
00:41:35,958 --> 00:41:40,542
Actually, sir, if you're sincere,
we can nab that killer in a day.

600
00:41:41,208 --> 00:41:42,833
Oh, no, sir.
What are you doing?

601
00:41:44,417 --> 00:41:45,833
Sir, what's wrong with you?

602
00:41:53,125 --> 00:41:54,125
What is it DC sir?

603
00:41:54,375 --> 00:41:57,417
Your wife wanted you to be the first
to hear the good news that she passed.

604
00:41:57,583 --> 00:41:59,958
I've been calling and texting.
There's no response from you.

605
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:01,958
Is sir too busy to respond?

606
00:42:10,792 --> 00:42:11,792
Anbu...

607
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,083
there's a birthday party.

608
00:42:13,292 --> 00:42:14,667
Get ready soon. We'll go for it.

609
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:19,375
Why there's no response from you?

610
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:22,000
As if you responded to me.

611
00:42:22,542 --> 00:42:26,167
Hey, weren't you very sure about
your results after the exams?

612
00:42:27,083 --> 00:42:28,750
So, where's the surprise
in this matter?

613
00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:32,458
That doesn't mean
you can't congratulate me.

614
00:42:33,292 --> 00:42:34,292
Congrats.

615
00:42:35,083 --> 00:42:37,083
I'll take a shower. You get ready.

616
00:42:38,625 --> 00:42:39,625
I am not going.

617
00:42:41,375 --> 00:42:43,250
It's the DGP daughter's birthday.

618
00:42:43,542 --> 00:42:44,958
I promised him to bring my family.

619
00:42:45,208 --> 00:42:46,333
Please let's go.

620
00:42:46,917 --> 00:42:49,083
Remind me
to get a bouquet on our way.

621
00:42:51,917 --> 00:42:53,292
As if the party is too important.

622
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:09,500
Thanks.

623
00:43:10,792 --> 00:43:11,792
Is that all I am getting?

624
00:43:13,042 --> 00:43:14,417
Don't you think it's too much?

625
00:43:14,667 --> 00:43:16,417
A thanks is more than enough
for this cake.

626
00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:18,750
One second.

627
00:44:00,750 --> 00:44:01,750
Good morning, sir.

628
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,208
Seems like you were here
since last night.

629
00:44:04,750 --> 00:44:06,667
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

630
00:44:08,333 --> 00:44:09,542
Hi, sir. Good morning.

631
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,292
‐Hi!
‐Morning.

632
00:44:13,375 --> 00:44:15,833
Sir, sorry.
He's got an appointment right away.

633
00:44:15,917 --> 00:44:17,917
So, please don't take
more than 5 minutes.

634
00:44:18,292 --> 00:44:21,458
Sir, the two people with you
in this picture are not alive anymore.

635
00:44:21,708 --> 00:44:25,750
Someone has meticulously planned
and murdered them both.

636
00:44:25,958 --> 00:44:29,542
Maybe you're the next target
of that killer.

637
00:44:30,667 --> 00:44:32,583
Before we can arrest that killer,

638
00:44:32,708 --> 00:44:34,708
we're here to give you protection.

639
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,292
Please try to understand
and cooperate with us, sir.

640
00:44:41,833 --> 00:44:45,042
In Europe, they're comparing
Tamil Nadu Police with the Scotland Yard.

641
00:44:50,667 --> 00:44:51,667
Look here.

642
00:44:52,333 --> 00:44:54,333
This is from my birthday party
at Le Méridien.

643
00:44:54,458 --> 00:44:56,292
There are 7 other people,
excluding me.

644
00:44:56,542 --> 00:44:58,083
So, tell me, who's next?

645
00:44:58,750 --> 00:45:02,083
With this evidence,
if we follow your stupid logic,

646
00:45:02,125 --> 00:45:04,000
then tell me.
I'll tell my secretary

647
00:45:04,125 --> 00:45:07,667
to give you their email IDs,
addresses and phone numbers.

648
00:45:15,208 --> 00:45:16,208
Thank you.

649
00:45:18,583 --> 00:45:21,792
Then what is your relationship
with the judge and this inspector?

650
00:45:21,958 --> 00:45:22,958
Now, look here.

651
00:45:23,417 --> 00:45:26,250
Srinivasan was my legal counsel
before he became a judge.

652
00:45:26,667 --> 00:45:29,250
And I met that inspector
through Judge Srinivasan.

653
00:45:29,458 --> 00:45:30,875
I've seen him only 2‐3 times.

654
00:45:31,250 --> 00:45:32,250
Anyway...

655
00:45:33,375 --> 00:45:34,375
thank you, sir.

656
00:45:34,375 --> 00:45:35,500
<i>What about the inquiry?</i>

657
00:45:35,667 --> 00:45:37,458
We didn't get any clue
from his side.

658
00:45:37,542 --> 00:45:39,125
<i>So, what's the next plan?</i>

659
00:45:40,708 --> 00:45:42,417
<i>Pon Manickavel, are you there?</i>

660
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:43,500
I'll keep you posted, sir.

661
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:44,792
<i>‐Make it quick.</i>
‐Sure, sir.

662
00:45:44,875 --> 00:45:46,375
<i>‐Fine, then.</i>
‐Thank you.

663
00:45:50,083 --> 00:45:51,833
Hey, why are you rushing?

664
00:45:51,958 --> 00:45:54,917
Sir, I've informed everything about
Maran's meeting to the Commissioner.

665
00:45:54,958 --> 00:45:56,750
<i>As he's got political influence,</i>

666
00:45:56,792 --> 00:45:58,167
<i>as per
the Commissioner's instructions,</i>

667
00:45:58,250 --> 00:46:01,042
<i>we're planning to give full protection
to Maran without his knowledge.</i>

668
00:46:01,125 --> 00:46:02,125
I mean this evening...

669
00:46:02,125 --> 00:46:03,709
‐Hey. Hey!
‐...after we nab the killer‐‐

670
00:46:03,792 --> 00:46:05,125
After nabbing the killer?

671
00:46:05,250 --> 00:46:06,667
Are you going to hang him
to death tomorrow?

672
00:46:06,750 --> 00:46:08,750
It's not that. There's pressure
from the department.

673
00:46:08,833 --> 00:46:09,792
The Commissioner has asked
for a swift‐‐

674
00:46:09,833 --> 00:46:13,333
Remember, 6 months ago, a watchman
was killed at your apartment.

675
00:46:13,417 --> 00:46:15,958
‐What happened to that case?
‐Sir, what happened was...

676
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,083
Why are you stuttering now?

677
00:46:17,167 --> 00:46:18,958
Watchman and that case.

678
00:46:19,208 --> 00:46:20,833
Just because the deceased
was a judge,

679
00:46:21,083 --> 00:46:22,500
a special team right away,

680
00:46:22,750 --> 00:46:24,083
immediate investigation,

681
00:46:24,208 --> 00:46:25,458
and a prompt report.

682
00:46:25,875 --> 00:46:28,000
So, there's partiality
when it comes to the dead as well.

683
00:46:28,083 --> 00:46:29,292
Sir, I'm not sure
what you're getting at.

684
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:32,084
That's right. You won't understand.
You will when you experience it.

685
00:46:35,958 --> 00:46:37,625
How many are stationed
at the 1st Main Road?

686
00:46:37,750 --> 00:46:39,542
Sir, there are 5 officers here.

687
00:46:39,708 --> 00:46:40,708
Be alert!

688
00:46:40,708 --> 00:46:42,750
Make gram <i>vadas</i>
instead of masala <i>vadas</i>.

689
00:46:42,833 --> 00:46:44,000
<i>Okay, fine.</i>

690
00:46:44,375 --> 00:46:45,792
‐What's that noise?
‐Isn't that a dead end?

691
00:46:45,875 --> 00:46:47,292
‐Mosquitoes.
‐Three are stationed here, sir.

692
00:46:47,375 --> 00:46:48,750
Not enough.
Ask 6 officers to be there.

693
00:46:48,833 --> 00:46:49,751
Okay, sir.

694
00:46:49,792 --> 00:46:51,542
There are 8 cops stationed
at the corner of 5th Cross Street.

695
00:46:52,708 --> 00:46:54,333
Will you be late tonight?

696
00:46:54,417 --> 00:46:56,250
There's an officer here who'll be
done soon, then I will come.

697
00:46:56,292 --> 00:46:57,168
Bye!

698
00:46:57,708 --> 00:46:59,208
‐Hello, sir.
‐Hello!

699
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:01,417
‐Come in, sir.
‐Have you blocked all the roads?

700
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:03,292
Yes, we have barricaded the roads.

701
00:47:03,417 --> 00:47:04,792
‐Be alert.
‐Sir, we're wide alert.

702
00:47:04,792 --> 00:47:05,792
‐Muthu?
‐Tell me, sir.

703
00:47:05,792 --> 00:47:07,668
Ask them to reduce the volume
of the walkie‐talkies.

704
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,292
‐Brother...
‐Hey!

705
00:47:10,667 --> 00:47:12,875
South, South‐West.
North, North‐West.

706
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,208
What will you do
if they jump from the sky?

707
00:47:17,417 --> 00:47:18,708
Ask to nab them sooner.

708
00:47:18,792 --> 00:47:20,750
It's getting late.
I'm longing for <i>vadas</i>.

709
00:47:39,708 --> 00:47:40,750
Stop!
Don't shoot.

710
00:47:40,875 --> 00:47:41,875
Catch him!

711
00:47:49,875 --> 00:47:51,542
Sir! The suspect is escaping
from the beach side.

712
00:47:51,583 --> 00:47:54,000
I repeat, I repeat. The suspect is
escaping from the beach side.

713
00:48:34,208 --> 00:48:36,083
Sir, he got away.

714
00:48:40,333 --> 00:48:41,333
Oh, shit!

715
00:48:44,875 --> 00:48:48,083
‐Sir, I warned‐‐
‐Do you realise now why we warned you?

716
00:48:48,375 --> 00:48:50,375
I don't know, sir.
I don't know what's happening.

717
00:48:51,208 --> 00:48:53,708
Anyway,
you guys have to look after it.

718
00:49:12,042 --> 00:49:13,792
Yes, Kailash here.

719
00:49:14,375 --> 00:49:16,667
I got a threatening message
that I'll die in 24 hours.

720
00:49:17,208 --> 00:49:18,208
What?

721
00:49:18,417 --> 00:49:19,792
I need to meet Manickavel
right away.

722
00:49:22,125 --> 00:49:23,375
Sir, do you have an appointment?

723
00:49:23,417 --> 00:49:24,750
Tell him it's the Scotland Police.

724
00:49:32,250 --> 00:49:35,292
Manickavel, if the press knows
about the threat to my life,

725
00:49:35,417 --> 00:49:37,333
my share value will drop by 20%.

726
00:49:37,917 --> 00:49:40,333
How much does 20% add up to?

727
00:49:40,458 --> 00:49:41,583
Around Rs. 50 crore.

728
00:49:41,625 --> 00:49:43,042
That's a big amount.

729
00:49:43,458 --> 00:49:45,500
If it's 50
for just threatening your life,

730
00:49:45,958 --> 00:49:47,125
what if they kill you?

731
00:49:48,250 --> 00:49:50,208
No, just for conversation.

732
00:49:50,750 --> 00:49:52,292
Don't play around, Manickavel.

733
00:49:52,458 --> 00:49:54,000
This company is nothing without me.

734
00:49:54,333 --> 00:49:55,875
Total Rs. 500 crore loss.

735
00:49:56,208 --> 00:49:58,250
Rs. 500 crore.

736
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:00,792
So, sir, isn't 20% of Rs. 50 crore

737
00:50:01,375 --> 00:50:02,583
Rs. 10 crore?

738
00:50:03,917 --> 00:50:05,750
Shall we crack
a small deal between us?

739
00:50:07,125 --> 00:50:09,375
You give that Rs. 10 crore to me.

740
00:50:09,625 --> 00:50:12,917
I'll make sure
you'll be safe without a scratch.

741
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,042
I will take care.

742
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:17,833
With extra care.

743
00:50:18,458 --> 00:50:21,625
Even the Grim Reaper
can't touch your soul.

744
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,334
Sir, what are you thinking about?

745
00:50:26,458 --> 00:50:28,292
I'm not asking for a share
in your profits.

746
00:50:28,417 --> 00:50:30,542
Instead, I'm asking for a share
from your loss.

747
00:50:31,792 --> 00:50:33,375
In my entire life
as a businessman,

748
00:50:33,708 --> 00:50:36,292
you are the first who has asked
for a share in my loss.

749
00:50:37,708 --> 00:50:40,833
I did stay sincere
after completing my IPS training.

750
00:50:43,958 --> 00:50:45,167
Nothing great.

751
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:51,417
<i>Six months ago,
I worked as an ASP at Salem.</i>

752
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:53,333
<i>There was a remarkable case.</i>

753
00:50:54,375 --> 00:50:57,958
<i>I wasn't aware
it will turn my life upside down.</i>

754
00:50:58,083 --> 00:51:02,292
<i>I get really outraged
looking at injustice.</i>

755
00:51:03,667 --> 00:51:05,578
<i>And if it's happening in my area,</i>

756
00:51:05,612 --> 00:51:08,125
<i>there's no space for anything
but action.</i>

757
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,500
It's the same reward
for all the emotions.

758
00:51:42,667 --> 00:51:44,375
But you're overreacting though.

759
00:51:44,708 --> 00:51:45,917
Come on, take it all.

760
00:51:52,375 --> 00:51:54,542
Hey, do you have an arrest warrant?

761
00:51:54,625 --> 00:51:56,708
Warrants are for arresting humans.

762
00:51:57,208 --> 00:51:59,875
But to hunt down
rabid dogs like you,

763
00:51:59,958 --> 00:52:01,583
why do we need a warrant?

764
00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:36,667
INTEGRATED COURT COMPLEX, SALEM

765
00:52:43,208 --> 00:52:45,667
Sir, look what they've done to us!

766
00:52:45,750 --> 00:52:47,458
Just look how they've messed up
our lives.

767
00:52:47,542 --> 00:52:51,375
Sir, sir, just look at the state
of my daughter.

768
00:52:51,750 --> 00:52:53,417
Oh, God!

769
00:52:54,625 --> 00:52:58,125
Oh, God, my dear daughter!

770
00:52:59,292 --> 00:53:02,375
They turned her into ashes.

771
00:53:06,292 --> 00:53:10,875
<i>My daughter used to work
in that sinner's jewelry shop.</i>

772
00:53:14,208 --> 00:53:17,167
<i>She used to refuse
to go to work every day.</i>

773
00:53:17,167 --> 00:53:21,833
<i>But I thought she was making excuses
to skip work and being lazy.</i>

774
00:53:23,542 --> 00:53:25,958
<i>Only now I realised
that her boss at the shop</i>

775
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,667
<i>was harassing her all the while.</i>

776
00:54:09,875 --> 00:54:12,042
As that girl's body was burned,

777
00:54:12,125 --> 00:54:13,750
we couldn't get the traces
of semen.

778
00:54:14,208 --> 00:54:17,958
Maybe the accused burnt the body
with that intention.

779
00:54:18,167 --> 00:54:22,458
<i>Dear Lord, no mother
should endure my pain.</i>

780
00:54:23,458 --> 00:54:24,792
<i>Owing to this...</i>

781
00:54:24,917 --> 00:54:28,708
<i>people will be scared
to have a girl child.</i>

782
00:54:30,542 --> 00:54:32,792
<i>The police have failed
to prove the crime</i>

783
00:54:32,833 --> 00:54:36,208
<i>committed by the accused,
Modilal Seth.</i>

784
00:54:36,250 --> 00:54:39,750
<i>So, this court
has let him walk free.</i>

785
00:54:39,792 --> 00:54:44,208
Oh, God, my daughter's murderer
has been let out without punishment!

786
00:54:44,333 --> 00:54:47,042
As a mother, I'm outraged!

787
00:54:47,458 --> 00:54:48,458
Oh, God!

788
00:54:48,583 --> 00:54:50,542
Well done! Well done!

789
00:54:51,042 --> 00:54:53,458
You just tore them apart.
Awesome.

790
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:17,708
Do you have a lighter?

791
00:55:19,292 --> 00:55:20,000
Oh!

792
00:55:27,792 --> 00:55:31,042
<i>All the evidence you need is here.
You got to prove it legally now.</i>

793
00:55:31,625 --> 00:55:34,625
<i>People like him
don't belong to this society.</i>

794
00:55:41,208 --> 00:55:42,125
Hey!

795
00:55:42,417 --> 00:55:44,083
You'll be tarnished to dust.

796
00:55:44,167 --> 00:55:45,167
‐Don't laugh.
‐Get lost.

797
00:55:45,333 --> 00:55:46,625
Your death will be gruesome.

798
00:55:46,750 --> 00:55:48,542
Listen, sir.

799
00:55:48,958 --> 00:55:51,625
The person who burned and killed
my daughter

800
00:55:51,833 --> 00:55:53,375
is walking free with a smile.

801
00:55:53,542 --> 00:55:54,875
Please kill him, sir.

802
00:55:55,250 --> 00:55:56,583
Sir, shoot and kill him!

803
00:55:56,625 --> 00:55:58,250
‐Come to the party this evening.
‐Sure!

804
00:55:58,458 --> 00:55:59,542
Shoot him down, sir.

805
00:56:00,083 --> 00:56:02,792
Shoot him, sir.
Shoot him, sir!

806
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,250
Shoot and kill him!

807
00:56:21,917 --> 00:56:22,917
Sir.

808
00:56:23,833 --> 00:56:25,125
We reached home.

809
00:56:51,417 --> 00:56:53,333
Why is there blood on you?

810
00:56:53,917 --> 00:56:55,000
What happened?

811
00:57:02,750 --> 00:57:03,833
<i>Shoot him, sir.</i>

812
00:57:04,167 --> 00:57:05,375
<i>Shoot him, sir!</i>

813
00:57:05,583 --> 00:57:07,708
Shoot and kill him!

814
00:57:11,583 --> 00:57:13,625
‐I won't spare you!
‐Okay, sure we'll be there.

815
00:57:13,750 --> 00:57:14,750
No!

816
00:57:31,292 --> 00:57:34,208
This gun is of no use to anyone.

817
00:57:36,625 --> 00:57:38,583
It's existence is moot.

818
00:57:39,667 --> 00:57:40,792
No!

819
00:58:57,875 --> 00:58:59,167
What is this, Mr. Manickavel?

820
00:58:59,375 --> 00:59:02,208
I never expected this from an honest
and passionate police officer like you.

821
00:59:03,208 --> 00:59:04,458
I understand your pain.

822
00:59:04,667 --> 00:59:07,000
But all this
is a part of the service.

823
00:59:07,167 --> 00:59:10,250
Sir, I didn't wear this uniform
for the sake of it.

824
00:59:10,417 --> 00:59:11,875
I wore this 'cause I loved it.

825
00:59:12,292 --> 00:59:13,708
The pain of removing it...

826
00:59:14,083 --> 00:59:15,458
only I can realize it.

827
00:59:15,917 --> 00:59:19,750
It's totally different in practical
compared to theory.

828
00:59:20,250 --> 00:59:21,458
Nothing seems right.

829
00:59:21,708 --> 00:59:23,250
I understand, Mr.Manickavel.

830
00:59:23,667 --> 00:59:25,667
But take your own time.

831
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,583
Please think about it.

832
00:59:28,042 --> 00:59:31,208
No, sir,
God gave me enough time to think.

833
00:59:31,458 --> 00:59:33,083
You're taking this decision
based on emotions.

834
00:59:33,458 --> 00:59:35,250
Just think about you and your family.

835
00:59:35,542 --> 00:59:36,708
Such a rank holder...

836
00:59:36,792 --> 00:59:38,458
what are you going to do
after quitting this job?

837
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,333
I'm gonna herd the cows.

838
01:00:20,375 --> 01:00:22,250
Once I finished IPS training...

839
01:00:23,833 --> 01:00:27,292
the moment of happiness when I held
the gun for the first time

840
01:00:28,208 --> 01:00:29,125
that feeling...

841
01:00:29,792 --> 01:00:32,667
I believed will last until I die.

842
01:00:34,417 --> 01:00:37,542
My gun which was destined to kill
a thousand criminals...

843
01:00:37,875 --> 01:00:41,208
became a reason to kill an innocent life.

844
01:00:41,583 --> 01:00:42,667
That pain...

845
01:00:43,042 --> 01:00:46,167
will haunt me until I die.

846
01:00:51,583 --> 01:00:55,125
My wisdom and the lesson that
I did not receive from the IPS training

847
01:00:55,667 --> 01:00:58,417
that one incident taught me a hard lesson.

848
01:00:58,792 --> 01:01:02,667
So, I started playing my second innings
just for the money.

849
01:01:03,333 --> 01:01:05,500
I wanna make millions, sir.

850
01:01:07,667 --> 01:01:09,250
Why are you looking at me like that?

851
01:01:09,750 --> 01:01:12,500
Won't we have a desires
to get a taste of your lifestyle?

852
01:01:12,833 --> 01:01:14,750
What will be the size of this house?

853
01:01:14,958 --> 01:01:18,000
Beach is right next to it,
and a swimming pool inside the house.

854
01:01:19,875 --> 01:01:21,792
Sir, don't you wanna enjoy
this throughout your life.

855
01:01:21,875 --> 01:01:23,458
Just trust me,
I'll take care of everything.

856
01:01:33,208 --> 01:01:34,083
Sir!

857
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:43,917
‐Sir!
‐Morning!

858
01:01:49,208 --> 01:01:50,833
Run the exterior camera.

859
01:02:05,917 --> 01:02:08,375
The security detail is good.
Impressive.

860
01:02:10,417 --> 01:02:11,458
Thank you.

861
01:02:13,250 --> 01:02:14,125
Sure.

862
01:02:18,542 --> 01:02:20,125
‐Okay?
‐Okay, thank you.

863
01:02:25,292 --> 01:02:27,042
Sir, it's the Commissioner.

864
01:02:27,625 --> 01:02:28,833
‐Hello
‐Yes, sir.

865
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:30,208
How is it going, Manickavel?

866
01:02:30,667 --> 01:02:31,958
I will take care, sir.

867
01:02:45,583 --> 01:02:46,583
Sir!

868
01:02:51,875 --> 01:02:53,167
What happened, Manickavel?

869
01:02:53,708 --> 01:02:55,125
‐Sir let's go.
‐Damn it!

870
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,042
Sir... no!

871
01:03:33,458 --> 01:03:34,125
Sir...

872
01:03:34,167 --> 01:03:36,250
Search the opposite building right away.

873
01:03:36,375 --> 01:03:37,167
‐Okay, sir.
‐Fast!

874
01:03:37,208 --> 01:03:38,208
Go fast!

875
01:03:39,708 --> 01:03:41,292
Show me all the cameras pointing
at the opposite building.

876
01:03:41,333 --> 01:03:42,625
Okay, sir.

877
01:03:52,625 --> 01:03:55,000
‐Nanda, we've checked it thoroughly.
‐Sir!

878
01:03:55,333 --> 01:03:56,833
Only the rifle is here.

879
01:03:58,250 --> 01:04:00,333
‐You've done a great job, Manickavel.
‐Thank you, sir.

880
01:04:00,417 --> 01:04:02,875
Sir, despite the fact
the security was tight.

881
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:03,833
Instead of getting closer...

882
01:04:03,917 --> 01:04:07,208
they staged a sniper shot 900ft
from the opposite building.

883
01:04:07,958 --> 01:04:09,125
Thank you, Manickavel.

884
01:04:11,125 --> 01:04:12,000
Thank you.

885
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:42,417
Brother, I require the CCTV footage
from the mosque gate.

886
01:06:24,375 --> 01:06:25,792
Manickavel, did you get the money?

887
01:06:25,833 --> 01:06:28,333
I'm very sure that the money
will arrive on time.

888
01:06:29,167 --> 01:06:31,375
I've sent you a video,
please have a look.

889
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:13,042
‐Well done, Kailash.
‐Thank you, sir.

890
01:07:18,250 --> 01:07:19,542
Did you see the video?

891
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:21,167
I did, Manickavel.

892
01:07:21,750 --> 01:07:23,292
It was him who killed the Judge.

893
01:07:23,375 --> 01:07:25,083
Also it was him who killed
the Inspector in a blast.

894
01:07:25,458 --> 01:07:27,167
And it was him,
who came to kill you at your house.

895
01:07:27,208 --> 01:07:29,542
Also it was him on the sniper yesterday.

896
01:07:29,625 --> 01:07:31,500
Take more money if you want...

897
01:07:31,708 --> 01:07:32,625
kill that old man!

898
01:07:33,292 --> 01:07:37,208
Fine, tell me what's your conflict
with that old man?

899
01:07:37,292 --> 01:07:38,708
We had our differences in the business.

900
01:07:39,708 --> 01:07:40,958
Don't worry, sir.

901
01:07:41,208 --> 01:07:44,125
No matter where he is,
I'll bring him to you.

902
01:07:44,333 --> 01:07:45,292
Relax!

903
01:07:49,417 --> 01:07:53,250
"It's practically different
from what I had studied."

904
01:07:53,708 --> 01:07:55,000
"Nothing is right, sir."

905
01:08:12,542 --> 01:08:14,250
I Pon Manickavel...

906
01:08:14,375 --> 01:08:15,792
do solemnly affirm that

907
01:08:15,833 --> 01:08:19,292
I will bear true faith and allegiance
to the Constitution of India

908
01:08:19,582 --> 01:08:21,167
as by the law established.

909
01:08:21,332 --> 01:08:22,832
I am proud of my country.

910
01:08:22,957 --> 01:08:25,625
And I'll always be faithful
to my Mother India.

911
01:08:25,832 --> 01:08:26,957
Jai Hind!

912
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,625
"Won't we have the desires
to get a taste of your lifestyle?"

913
01:09:27,457 --> 01:09:29,582
Did you go through the details
of the new hotel project?

914
01:09:44,875 --> 01:09:47,332
Okay, thank you.
See you guys later.

915
01:09:47,375 --> 01:09:48,042
Thank you.

916
01:09:54,958 --> 01:09:58,333
Manickavel, my daily routine
must be boring for you.

917
01:09:58,375 --> 01:09:59,750
Let's have a party tonight.

918
01:10:11,375 --> 01:10:17,875
"Jittaan Jittaan Jinukku"

919
01:10:18,083 --> 01:10:23,458
"Jittaan Jittaan Jinukku"

920
01:10:30,958 --> 01:10:34,750
"Jittaan Jittaan Jinukku"

921
01:10:34,875 --> 01:10:38,542
"Jittaan Jittaan Jinukku"

922
01:10:45,917 --> 01:10:52,917
"My heart is longing for love,
my heart is longing for love"

923
01:10:53,625 --> 01:10:56,167
"look over here, my dear"

924
01:10:56,292 --> 01:11:00,667
"shall I make you comfortable around me"

925
01:11:00,917 --> 01:11:04,792
"Imma reincarnation of Silk"

926
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:08,792
"many have lost their sleep,
is it a crime?"

927
01:11:08,917 --> 01:11:12,542
"my loins long for a new love everyday"

928
01:11:12,583 --> 01:11:14,625
"Jittaan Jittaan Jinukku"

929
01:11:14,792 --> 01:11:16,917
Sir, are they from Mumbai?

930
01:11:17,250 --> 01:11:19,292
Sir, shall I get their phone number?

931
01:11:19,958 --> 01:11:21,875
You're about to go on a pilgrimage,
get lost.

932
01:11:22,833 --> 01:11:25,250
Sir, get me their number, might come
in handy during desperate times.

933
01:11:26,208 --> 01:11:27,375
Sure, take it.

934
01:11:50,208 --> 01:11:53,917
"Imma strong contender to lust itself"

935
01:11:54,042 --> 01:11:57,417
"Come on 'O' dear ravish me"

936
01:11:57,750 --> 01:12:01,583
"the bed is all decked up
since yesterday"

937
01:12:01,708 --> 01:12:05,000
"why don't you come and ravish me"

938
01:12:05,125 --> 01:12:08,708
"no one can top my sensuality
unless its me"

939
01:12:08,750 --> 01:12:12,833
"my world has gone upside down
longing for your love"

940
01:12:12,917 --> 01:12:16,583
"grace me with your life 'O' dear"

941
01:12:16,708 --> 01:12:20,333
"I won't let go,
even when it's dawn"

942
01:12:20,417 --> 01:12:24,208
"let new stories begin,
as one finishes"

943
01:12:24,375 --> 01:12:27,542
"Jittaan Jittaan Jinukku"

944
01:12:27,958 --> 01:12:31,583
"Jittaan Jittaan Jinukku"

945
01:12:31,708 --> 01:12:35,792
"Jittaan Jittaan Jinukku"

946
01:12:35,917 --> 01:12:39,292
"all our love is for you 'O' dear"

947
01:12:39,500 --> 01:12:45,750
"My heart is longing for love,
my heart is longing for love"

948
01:12:46,792 --> 01:12:49,417
"look over here, my dear"

949
01:12:49,542 --> 01:12:53,750
"shall I make you comfortable around me"

950
01:12:54,375 --> 01:12:58,292
"Imma reincarnation of Silk"

951
01:12:58,375 --> 01:13:02,042
"many have lost their sleep,
is it a crime?"

952
01:13:02,167 --> 01:13:06,333
"my loins long for a new love everyday"

953
01:13:54,875 --> 01:13:58,417
"Jittaan Jittaan Jinukku"

954
01:13:58,667 --> 01:14:02,333
"Jittaan Jittaan Jinukku"

955
01:14:02,500 --> 01:14:06,292
"Jittaan Jittaan Jinukku"

956
01:14:06,375 --> 01:14:10,042
"all our love is for you 'O' dear"

957
01:14:10,167 --> 01:14:13,708
"Jittaan Jittaan Jinukku"

958
01:14:13,875 --> 01:14:17,458
"Jittaan Jittaan Jinukku"

959
01:14:17,667 --> 01:14:21,292
"Jittaan Jittaan Jinukku"

960
01:14:21,417 --> 01:14:25,458
"all our love is for you 'O' dear"

961
01:14:35,208 --> 01:14:38,292
Sir, this old man's name is Nasrathullah.

962
01:14:38,792 --> 01:14:41,458
His native is Nedumpalayam village
next to Ambur.

963
01:14:41,792 --> 01:14:43,958
He used to run
a small leather business out there.

964
01:14:44,167 --> 01:14:47,250
His daughter and son‐in‐law
died in an accident.

965
01:14:47,417 --> 01:14:51,500
In that depression he lost focus
on business and failed.

966
01:14:51,625 --> 01:14:54,708
The only consolation in this tragedy
was his grand daughter.

967
01:14:54,875 --> 01:14:59,208
She worked hard and joined an
Engineering college in Chennai under merit.

968
01:14:59,333 --> 01:15:02,333
She used to do part time jobs
during her education.

969
01:15:02,667 --> 01:15:04,417
Hosting events at malls and hotels...

970
01:15:04,542 --> 01:15:07,417
wedding receptions and working in Ad‐films.

971
01:15:07,500 --> 01:15:10,333
She used that money to cover
her expenses for education.

972
01:15:10,583 --> 01:15:14,708
In one such occasion,
Maran spotted her at an Ad‐shoot.

973
01:15:14,958 --> 01:15:16,750
He tried to pursue her...

974
01:15:16,917 --> 01:15:20,208
got her number through an agent
and started flirting with her.

975
01:15:20,375 --> 01:15:21,292
Sent her many messages.

976
01:15:21,417 --> 01:15:25,458
Initially she was patient, but later
filed a complaint with the police.

977
01:15:25,583 --> 01:15:28,250
Since he was influential nothing happened.

978
01:15:28,792 --> 01:15:30,958
So, that girl made use of #MeToo.

979
01:15:31,042 --> 01:15:35,875
Tagged everyone from the Commissioner
till an ordinary police officer in a post.

980
01:15:36,542 --> 01:15:38,292
That post went viral!

981
01:15:38,417 --> 01:15:40,667
And Arjun K. Maran was arrested overnight.

982
01:15:41,375 --> 01:15:43,458
But they came to know
during the investigation...

983
01:15:43,500 --> 01:15:45,792
that his mobile phone
was lost at the hotel.

984
01:15:45,833 --> 01:15:48,667
Also he blocked the sim and has
filed a complaint in regards to it.

985
01:15:48,833 --> 01:15:52,042
Once it was proved in court,
that he didn't send those messages...

986
01:15:52,125 --> 01:15:53,958
subsequently Maran was released.

987
01:15:54,917 --> 01:15:57,375
Unfortunately,
shortly after these incidents...

988
01:15:57,458 --> 01:15:59,708
that girl died in a train accident.

989
01:16:00,583 --> 01:16:03,000
That's what Police records states.

990
01:16:03,625 --> 01:16:04,625
But, sir...

991
01:16:05,125 --> 01:16:09,375
must be wondering why this elderly
is set out to kill Maran?

992
01:16:11,333 --> 01:16:13,083
As per my investigation...

993
01:16:13,917 --> 01:16:18,833
I went to his native and investigated
few of his near and dear ones.

994
01:16:18,917 --> 01:16:20,583
And then when I finally went to his house.

995
01:16:25,708 --> 01:16:28,000
I found a diary written by him.

996
01:16:28,250 --> 01:16:31,208
My son and daughter‐in‐law
died in an accident.

997
01:16:31,417 --> 01:16:36,500
I incurred a huge loss
by not focusing on the business.

998
01:16:36,750 --> 01:16:38,792
I was almost on the verge
of killing myself.

999
01:16:40,917 --> 01:16:43,583
Grandpa,
please don't leave me behind.

1000
01:16:43,875 --> 01:16:46,417
Grandpa, please get down.

1001
01:16:48,750 --> 01:16:51,583
Grandpa,
please don't leave me behind.

1002
01:16:52,458 --> 01:16:53,917
That's when my grand daughter,

1003
01:16:54,333 --> 01:16:57,167
saved me and gave a new meaning
to my life

1004
01:16:57,542 --> 01:16:58,625
Grandpa!

1005
01:17:07,083 --> 01:17:12,083
"My dear Princess, reminiscing dahlia"

1006
01:17:12,208 --> 01:17:14,333
"come to me 'O' dear"

1007
01:17:14,625 --> 01:17:17,125
"come to me 'O' dear"

1008
01:17:17,292 --> 01:17:22,333
"just your glance floods my heart"

1009
01:17:22,417 --> 01:17:24,667
"come to me 'O' dear"

1010
01:17:24,875 --> 01:17:27,417
"come to me 'O' dear"

1011
01:17:27,875 --> 01:17:32,833
"I ruminate 'bout you
without sleeping late in the night"

1012
01:17:32,875 --> 01:17:37,792
"so does the moon,
which stares back at me"

1013
01:17:37,917 --> 01:17:42,958
"my desire is to see you scale the peaks"

1014
01:17:43,083 --> 01:17:47,417
"only then my soul
will depart this world"

1015
01:17:47,625 --> 01:17:50,042
"you're my mother of love"

1016
01:17:50,125 --> 01:17:55,083
"My dear Princess, reminiscing dahlia"

1017
01:17:55,250 --> 01:17:57,083
"come to me 'O' dear"

1018
01:17:57,708 --> 01:17:59,708
"come to me 'O' dear"

1019
01:18:00,208 --> 01:18:05,458
"just your glance floods my heart"

1020
01:18:05,792 --> 01:18:07,292
"Grandpa!"

1021
01:18:07,833 --> 01:18:10,458
"come to me 'O' dear"

1022
01:18:20,833 --> 01:18:25,875
"paintings will come
to take lessons from you"

1023
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:30,583
"flowers will gather and bloom
one like your shadow"

1024
01:18:30,667 --> 01:18:34,750
"through your magical eyes"

1025
01:18:35,625 --> 01:18:39,500
"I followed you turning into your mother"

1026
01:18:39,583 --> 01:18:40,625
"followed you"

1027
01:18:40,750 --> 01:18:45,750
"I'm short on words 'O' my dear"

1028
01:18:45,833 --> 01:18:50,292
"I'm just an ordinary disciple of you"

1029
01:18:50,417 --> 01:18:56,667
"the touch of your precious hands,
turns the sand into gold"

1030
01:18:58,250 --> 01:19:02,792
"My dear Princess, reminiscing dahlia"

1031
01:19:03,333 --> 01:19:05,875
"come to me 'O' dear"

1032
01:19:05,917 --> 01:19:08,292
"come to me 'O' dear"

"come to me 'O' dear"

1038
01:19:23,583 --> 01:19:27,167
"come to me 'O' dear"

1039
01:19:31,583 --> 01:19:35,042
In order to keep in touch
with me everyday...

1040
01:19:35,375 --> 01:19:39,042
she bought a phone for me,
from her first month's salary.

1041
01:19:45,792 --> 01:19:46,667
Hi grandpa!

1042
01:19:46,708 --> 01:19:48,333
Why did you spend so much, dear?

1043
01:19:48,667 --> 01:19:50,417
It was not necessary.

1044
01:19:50,500 --> 01:19:52,708
Grandpa, didn't you say
you wanted to see me everyday?

1045
01:19:52,833 --> 01:19:54,917
Now you can see me everyday
on video call.

1046
01:19:55,917 --> 01:19:57,208
Why are you coughing, grandpa?

1047
01:19:57,292 --> 01:19:58,917
Nothing much, it's the cold.

1048
01:20:00,125 --> 01:20:02,083
I hope you're taking
your medicines on time.

1049
01:20:02,208 --> 01:20:04,583
Yeah, I've been taking them on time.

1050
01:20:05,167 --> 01:20:08,000
‐I'll top the class, grandpa.
‐That's great, dear.

1051
01:20:08,125 --> 01:20:10,167
Fine, when are you coming home?

1052
01:20:10,208 --> 01:20:11,958
I'll come down next week for sure.

1053
01:20:12,333 --> 01:20:13,583
‐Who is that?
‐Just a minute, grandpa.

1054
01:20:14,250 --> 01:20:18,042
Maran after getting out of the prison,
went crazy over my grand daughter.

1055
01:20:18,167 --> 01:20:19,583
He sent his men...

1056
01:20:19,875 --> 01:20:22,000
they beat up my grand daughter and
took away right in front of my eyes.

1057
01:20:22,375 --> 01:20:23,667
Let go of me!

1058
01:20:25,417 --> 01:20:27,708
I was baffled and went to
the Police station.

1059
01:20:28,083 --> 01:20:30,917
Sir. Sir... please have a look at this.

1060
01:20:31,083 --> 01:20:34,667
few people took away my grand daughter,
while she was on phone.

1061
01:20:34,750 --> 01:20:36,750
When I tried calling again,
it says switched‐off.

1062
01:20:37,042 --> 01:20:39,625
Not sure what happened to her.
Please, please.

1063
01:20:40,250 --> 01:20:42,792
No one respected my plea
neither gave a resolution.

1064
01:20:43,583 --> 01:20:47,625
Two days later,
I saw my grand daughter as a corpse.

1065
01:20:47,750 --> 01:20:52,500
"My dear Princess, reminiscing dahlia"

1066
01:20:52,583 --> 01:20:54,417
"You're my precious"

1067
01:20:54,875 --> 01:20:56,833
"You're my precious"

1068
01:20:57,375 --> 01:21:02,583
"just your glance floods my heart"

1069
01:21:02,667 --> 01:21:04,375
"You're my precious"

1070
01:21:04,958 --> 01:21:07,292
"You're my precious"

1071
01:21:07,917 --> 01:21:12,958
"I ruminate 'bout you
without sleeping late in the night"

1072
01:21:13,167 --> 01:21:17,917
"so does the moon,
which stares back at me"

1073
01:21:18,208 --> 01:21:21,333
"my desire is to see you
live long and happy life"

1074
01:21:21,500 --> 01:21:24,333
My grand daughter was the only reason
for my happiness in life.

1075
01:21:24,708 --> 01:21:26,458
When she passed away...

1076
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:28,833
I was clueless in what to do?

1077
01:21:30,708 --> 01:21:34,250
I lost faith in law, justice and integrity.

1078
01:21:34,417 --> 01:21:36,667
The people who were the reason
for my grand daughter's death...

1079
01:21:36,792 --> 01:21:38,875
I wanted to avenge them
with my bare hands.

1080
01:21:41,542 --> 01:21:43,333
Before killing these men...

1081
01:21:43,375 --> 01:21:45,458
he tried buying guns illegally in Salem.

1082
01:21:45,542 --> 01:21:47,250
And was caught by the police.

1083
01:21:47,333 --> 01:21:49,958
Nasrathullah was locked up here
for buying a gun illegally.

1084
01:21:50,417 --> 01:21:52,417
One of his cell‐mate
was sentenced to death.

1085
01:21:52,458 --> 01:21:53,708
He was punished.

1086
01:21:54,250 --> 01:21:55,417
Another cell‐mate was Bhoominathan.

1087
01:21:55,417 --> 01:21:57,417
Just this last week,
he got out of the jail

1088
01:21:57,458 --> 01:21:58,708
If we try and catch him...

1089
01:21:58,792 --> 01:22:02,750
or if we can find the details
on the second gun in Judge's murder case

1090
01:22:02,875 --> 01:22:04,500
we can close this case.

1091
01:22:04,583 --> 01:22:05,625
Good job, Kailash.

1092
01:22:10,083 --> 01:22:11,750
‐Karthick are the papers ready?
‐Ready, sir.

1093
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:13,958
Sir, construction work is on
as per the schedule.

1094
01:22:14,250 --> 01:22:16,250
But only the interior work
is getting a bit delayed.

1095
01:22:16,500 --> 01:22:17,875
I've already warned them about it.

1096
01:22:17,917 --> 01:22:18,708
Hello, sir!

1097
01:22:18,833 --> 01:22:21,000
This project was supposed to
get over 3 months ago.

1098
01:22:22,458 --> 01:22:23,625
‐Why is the delay?
‐Sir, it's like...

1099
01:22:24,083 --> 01:22:24,958
Sir!

1100
01:22:53,208 --> 01:22:54,625
Stay inside, until I say so.

1101
01:23:52,375 --> 01:23:53,750
Sir, come on, come on.

1102
01:23:53,833 --> 01:23:55,208
Come on, come on...

1103
01:24:04,292 --> 01:24:05,750
There are glass pieces inside his abdomen.

1104
01:24:05,833 --> 01:24:07,417
It can be removed only after a surgery.

1105
01:24:07,583 --> 01:24:08,833
it's quite critical though.

1106
01:24:09,083 --> 01:24:11,042
Please put your signature
on this consent form

1107
01:24:11,083 --> 01:24:12,333
Doctor is he in danger?

1108
01:24:12,417 --> 01:24:13,833
Sorry, I can't say anything now.

1109
01:24:13,917 --> 01:24:15,583
We will let you know after the surgery.

1110
01:24:19,542 --> 01:24:21,000
‐Hello!
‐Arjun K. Maran, here.

1111
01:24:21,125 --> 01:24:22,958
Yes, sir, Dr. Chandrashekar here.

1112
01:24:23,083 --> 01:24:24,750
Sir, patient is seriously ill now.

1113
01:24:24,792 --> 01:24:26,083
We will do our best.

1114
01:24:26,750 --> 01:24:28,917
I don't care about the expense,
he should be saved.

1115
01:24:28,958 --> 01:24:30,583
Let me know if you need doctors
from abroad.

1116
01:24:30,625 --> 01:24:31,708
I'll make arrangements immediately.

1117
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:32,917
Okay, sir.

1118
01:24:40,292 --> 01:24:41,292
Sir. Good morning, sir.

1119
01:24:41,333 --> 01:24:43,667
‐Where is he?
‐At 2nd floor, CCU. ‐ Let's go.

1120
01:24:48,250 --> 01:24:49,000
Sir!

1121
01:24:49,083 --> 01:24:50,375
How is he doing?

1122
01:24:50,583 --> 01:24:51,917
The surgery is in process.

1123
01:24:52,083 --> 01:24:53,333
They're stating it's quite critical.

1124
01:24:53,417 --> 01:24:57,000
How can you send him in,
without any back‐up or security?

1125
01:24:58,958 --> 01:25:00,042
How did it happen?

1126
01:25:00,583 --> 01:25:02,125
Sir, one minute.

1127
01:25:02,750 --> 01:25:05,875
Sir, Manickavel himself
is responsible for his state.

1128
01:25:06,125 --> 01:25:07,000
What are you saying?

1129
01:25:07,167 --> 01:25:10,833
When he went to Arjun K. Maran's house
in regards to Judge's murder case...

1130
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:12,667
he discovered that something is fishy.

1131
01:25:15,125 --> 01:25:17,458
As he has high level political influence...

1132
01:25:17,500 --> 01:25:19,167
we couldn't force him for a statement.

1133
01:25:19,292 --> 01:25:22,833
So, Kailash placed a bug in his house
without his knowledge.

1134
01:25:35,458 --> 01:25:36,875
When we heard their conversation...

1135
01:25:36,958 --> 01:25:39,792
we learned that there's a 4th person
involved in this case.

1136
01:25:40,042 --> 01:25:41,958
When we were clueless about the 4th person.

1137
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,958
Sir, if we wish to know
who that 4th person is...

1138
01:25:45,083 --> 01:25:47,208
Arjun K. Maran should trust us blindly.

1139
01:25:47,500 --> 01:25:48,375
I have a plan.

1140
01:25:48,417 --> 01:25:51,875
In order to spook him,
Manickavel sent him a threatening message.

1141
01:25:53,208 --> 01:25:54,875
Arjun K. Maran,
who got spooked by the message...

1142
01:25:54,917 --> 01:25:56,458
I need to meet Manickavel,
right away.

1143
01:25:56,583 --> 01:25:58,167
In order to be around him all the time...

1144
01:25:58,250 --> 01:26:01,375
he tried to win his trust
by taking a bribe from him.

1145
01:26:02,708 --> 01:26:04,917
"Give me that 10 crores"

1146
01:26:05,125 --> 01:26:06,708
Making use of this opportunity.

1147
01:26:06,708 --> 01:26:09,667
Manickavel was around Arjun K. Maran
all the time.

1148
01:26:13,333 --> 01:26:16,333
The shootout at that building
was staged by Manickavel.

1149
01:26:56,667 --> 01:26:57,667
Sir!

1150
01:27:11,333 --> 01:27:14,375
Post that incident,
Arjun K. Maran started trusting Manickavel.

1151
01:27:14,500 --> 01:27:15,292
Oh!

1152
01:27:16,125 --> 01:27:16,958
Thank you, Manickavel

1153
01:27:17,042 --> 01:27:17,917
It's okay.

1154
01:27:21,042 --> 01:27:22,708
It's okay.

1155
01:27:24,542 --> 01:27:27,375
This incident occurred
during one such instance.

1156
01:27:27,583 --> 01:27:30,792
Manickavel must know the clue
about the 4th person...

1157
01:27:31,042 --> 01:27:33,292
'cause he would've seen
the face of the killer.

1158
01:27:33,417 --> 01:27:37,833
Manickavel risked his life
for the sake of our department.

1159
01:27:38,958 --> 01:27:44,500
"Life is a testament of
downfall and rising"

1160
01:27:44,875 --> 01:27:50,417
"All you need is a push to rise high"

1161
01:27:50,625 --> 01:27:56,333
"Her breath is enough
to embark on this journey"

1162
01:27:56,500 --> 01:28:02,500
"my eyes are going dry
in the duress"

1163
01:28:02,625 --> 01:28:08,125
"to have a lap to sleep on forever"

1164
01:28:08,375 --> 01:28:14,125
"forever my heart will beat for you"

1165
01:28:31,792 --> 01:28:33,875
Don't worry, he'll be fine.

1166
01:28:34,042 --> 01:28:35,667
The entire department
is with you as a support.

1167
01:28:37,333 --> 01:28:40,458
Moorthy, I want your complete focus
on Manickavel's recovery.

1168
01:28:40,542 --> 01:28:41,667
And I want him back to work.

1169
01:28:41,917 --> 01:28:46,958
"Life is a testament of
downfall and rising"

1170
01:28:47,083 --> 01:28:48,208
He's right here, dad.

1171
01:28:48,375 --> 01:28:50,250
Listen, dad wants to speak to you.
Here, take this.

1172
01:28:50,583 --> 01:28:55,500
"All you need is a push to rise high"

1173
01:28:55,750 --> 01:29:02,542
"Her breath is enough
to embark on this journey"

1174
01:29:03,250 --> 01:29:05,083
You can't be as good cook as I am.

1175
01:29:06,500 --> 01:29:07,500
Oh, no!

1176
01:29:09,083 --> 01:29:11,875
Hey, why are you getting scared
for silly matters?

1177
01:29:13,083 --> 01:29:14,208
Hey!

1178
01:29:14,833 --> 01:29:16,833
Don't you dare come back
to the kitchen, get lost.

1179
01:29:17,833 --> 01:29:19,667
Thought at least today
I will have a good meal.

1180
01:29:19,833 --> 01:29:20,500
Get lost!

1181
01:30:05,292 --> 01:30:06,083
Sir...

1182
01:30:07,250 --> 01:30:10,708
‐Follow my instructions.
‐Okay, sir

1183
01:30:25,792 --> 01:30:27,667
Excuse me,
I need a favor from you.

1184
01:30:27,750 --> 01:30:28,375
Yes. sir.

1185
01:30:28,500 --> 01:30:33,500
I need the entire CCTV footage
from May 20th.

1186
01:30:33,667 --> 01:30:36,458
Sorry, sir, during the fire accident
that occurred last month...

1187
01:30:36,625 --> 01:30:39,542
the entire stock of CCTV footage
was destroyed.

1188
01:30:39,583 --> 01:30:41,833
We've already filed a complaint
at the Police station.

1189
01:30:42,833 --> 01:30:45,417
I'll tell you,
how to proceed further.

1190
01:30:45,875 --> 01:30:46,833
Okay, sir.

1191
01:31:03,750 --> 01:31:04,458
Sir!

1192
01:31:04,917 --> 01:31:07,917
‐A small information regarding this case.
‐Sir.

1193
01:31:08,250 --> 01:31:11,667
On May 20th an Ad‐shoot happened
at the same Hotel.

1194
01:31:12,042 --> 01:31:15,208
The production company will definitely
have the footage.

1195
01:31:15,708 --> 01:31:17,792
You track that down and get it immediately.

1196
01:31:17,875 --> 01:31:18,792
Definitely, sir.

1197
01:31:25,750 --> 01:31:26,792
Sir, hard disk.

1198
01:32:25,583 --> 01:32:27,375
Sir, this is Karthikeyan from Armory.

1199
01:32:27,417 --> 01:32:28,042
Tell me, sir.

1200
01:32:28,125 --> 01:32:32,625
Sir, we got the details on the
second gun used in Judge's murder.

1201
01:32:33,042 --> 01:32:35,792
It's M51, Taiwan gun.

1202
01:32:36,125 --> 01:32:38,167
It's quite a complicated gun.

1203
01:32:38,500 --> 01:32:40,083
As it's a front loading gun...

1204
01:32:40,250 --> 01:32:42,917
it's hard to use this gun,
without proper training.

1205
01:32:43,542 --> 01:32:46,042
And usually this gun is available
in the market.

1206
01:32:46,250 --> 01:32:48,458
As per our records, in 2008...

1207
01:32:48,583 --> 01:32:50,792
Govt. imported these guns from Taiwan.

1208
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,708
Is it possible to trace the address
from the list of gun owners?

1209
01:32:53,792 --> 01:32:55,667
We don't have that data list with us.

1210
01:32:55,750 --> 01:32:56,625
Then, what else?

1211
01:32:56,667 --> 01:33:00,292
I think, there are chances
if we try the Delhi armory.

1212
01:33:00,542 --> 01:33:03,833
Delhi armory is the only source, where we
can find the details of the unknown gun.

1213
01:33:04,333 --> 01:33:05,875
Contact them right away.

1214
01:33:09,250 --> 01:33:10,792
Please get all my reports.

1215
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,792
He holds an iPhone 10.

1216
01:33:49,292 --> 01:33:50,083
Diamond Edition.

1217
01:33:50,167 --> 01:33:53,417
Inquire at all the iStore dealers
in Chennai.

1218
01:33:57,125 --> 01:33:59,625
As that phone is a special edition...

1219
01:34:00,083 --> 01:34:03,000
the list of buyers will be less.

1220
01:34:06,542 --> 01:34:09,083
Sir, a total of 150 people
have bought this phone.

1221
01:34:09,250 --> 01:34:10,375
Purchase date.

1222
01:34:11,333 --> 01:34:12,458
Age wise.

1223
01:34:13,292 --> 01:34:14,917
Short list everything.

1224
01:34:36,583 --> 01:34:37,750
‐Hello.
‐Sir...

1225
01:34:38,417 --> 01:34:39,792
the date you've mentioned

1226
01:34:40,250 --> 01:34:43,417
we tracked down the number
in that hotel tower range.

1227
01:34:45,917 --> 01:34:47,625
‐Share the location
‐Okay, sir.

1228
01:34:47,833 --> 01:34:50,542
Sir, how come you're going alone?

1229
01:34:50,667 --> 01:34:51,750
I'm ready now.

1230
01:35:25,375 --> 01:35:26,458
‐Hi, Manickavel

1231
01:35:26,750 --> 01:35:28,917
‐You managed to save Maran
from my men.

1232
01:35:29,375 --> 01:35:32,250
‐if you can, try saving your wife.

1233
01:35:36,667 --> 01:35:37,583
Manick!

1234
01:35:44,333 --> 01:35:45,250
Manick!

1235
01:35:48,542 --> 01:35:49,542
Manick!

1236
01:36:47,625 --> 01:36:48,417
Let go of him, damn it!

1237
01:36:48,500 --> 01:36:49,083
Let go of him.

1238
01:36:49,167 --> 01:36:50,708
‐Anbu, go from here.
‐Let go of him.

1239
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:44,208
Manick!

1240
01:37:52,792 --> 01:37:54,792
‐Anbu are you okay?
‐I'm okay.

1241
01:38:58,625 --> 01:39:00,250
Hey, tell me.

1242
01:39:00,542 --> 01:39:02,083
Who sent you damn it?

1243
01:40:02,042 --> 01:40:03,250
Manickavel!

1244
01:40:08,625 --> 01:40:09,917
Sir, who the hell is he?

1245
01:40:12,958 --> 01:40:14,625
What does he have to do with me?

1246
01:40:16,750 --> 01:40:18,875
The other day an old man
came to kill you...

1247
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:20,000
today he has come.

1248
01:40:20,333 --> 01:40:22,833
We're clueless who will come for us next.

1249
01:40:24,042 --> 01:40:27,083
Sir, I can't blindly handle this case
without knowing its history.

1250
01:40:27,792 --> 01:40:28,500
Sorry!

1251
01:40:34,542 --> 01:40:35,708
Manickavel!

1252
01:40:39,250 --> 01:40:43,583
Only one person is the reason,
why these two came to kill me.

1253
01:40:43,792 --> 01:40:46,375
And the name of that person is,
Badrinath.

1254
01:40:52,458 --> 01:40:55,250
He's a successful businessman in State,
Central and International level.

1255
01:40:55,417 --> 01:40:56,625
Hi, please to meet you.

1256
01:40:56,750 --> 01:40:58,417
‐Hello.
‐So, what's going on?

1257
01:40:58,542 --> 01:41:00,875
The project is near completion.
Cheers!

1258
01:41:01,125 --> 01:41:04,208
He has the full support from
the Home Minister and the Govt.

1259
01:41:05,333 --> 01:41:07,333
I used to be his shell‐face.

1260
01:41:07,375 --> 01:41:11,292
But one day he said that will make me
a partner in a new 500 crore project

1261
01:41:11,375 --> 01:41:12,750
And asked me to come to Taj Hotel.

1262
01:41:12,875 --> 01:41:13,875
My pleasure, sir.

1263
01:41:14,333 --> 01:41:15,625
Yes! Yes!

1264
01:41:16,083 --> 01:41:18,833
He is psychotic, when it comes to women.

1265
01:41:20,333 --> 01:41:21,833
If he likes a girl...

1266
01:41:22,167 --> 01:41:25,208
even if she's ugly,
he'll go extremes to attain her.

1267
01:41:25,292 --> 01:41:27,333
He'll use them as long as he wants...

1268
01:41:27,417 --> 01:41:28,833
and then he'll kill them.

1269
01:42:00,250 --> 01:42:03,292
I live my life, King Size!

1270
01:42:03,583 --> 01:42:07,000
He bumped into a girl
at the hotel's elevator.

1271
01:42:07,167 --> 01:42:07,750
Okay.

1272
01:42:08,042 --> 01:42:09,250
Yeah, sure.

1273
01:42:11,750 --> 01:42:12,917
I'll call you back.

1274
01:42:33,208 --> 01:42:35,500
Hi, can I have your number?

1275
01:42:39,583 --> 01:42:43,208
During that meeting I came to know,
that girl got him upset.

1276
01:42:43,333 --> 01:42:44,458
Good Morning, Mr. Badri.

1277
01:42:44,792 --> 01:42:46,750
‐This the Judge and the Inspector.
‐Hi sir...

1278
01:43:01,333 --> 01:43:02,708
Sir, you had asked them to come.

1279
01:43:02,833 --> 01:43:04,000
They're here to help us.

1280
01:43:05,417 --> 01:43:08,125
Sir, you wanted to meet them
regarding our project.

1281
01:43:08,458 --> 01:43:09,625
Is something upsetting you?

1282
01:43:40,292 --> 01:43:42,208
I didn't want to lose out on the deal.

1283
01:43:42,250 --> 01:43:43,625
I went and spoke to the agent.

1284
01:43:51,125 --> 01:43:52,375
What is that girl's name?

1285
01:43:52,708 --> 01:43:54,958
It's Dhanya, she's a college student.

1286
01:43:57,333 --> 01:43:58,750
She's working part‐time.

1287
01:44:03,125 --> 01:44:04,083
Give me your price.

1288
01:44:04,125 --> 01:44:07,000
Sorry Sir, she's not the type
you're looking for.

1289
01:44:11,083 --> 01:44:13,792
I took her number from him
and spoke to her myself.

1290
01:44:13,958 --> 01:44:17,042
She turned that into a big issue
and got me arrested.

1291
01:44:18,250 --> 01:44:21,583
I was never humiliated
so much in my life.

1292
01:44:22,208 --> 01:44:25,083
With the help of Judge Srinivasan,
I got out easily.

1293
01:44:26,375 --> 01:44:29,500
Once I got out of the prison,
I wanted to kill her.

1294
01:44:30,792 --> 01:44:32,167
Let me go!

1295
01:44:33,833 --> 01:44:34,750
Please...

1296
01:44:35,292 --> 01:44:37,250
Please, sir, let me go.

1297
01:44:37,542 --> 01:44:38,833
Please, sir.

1298
01:44:39,333 --> 01:44:42,708
I beg of you, please let me go.

1299
01:44:43,042 --> 01:44:44,792
‐Please...
‐You got me arrested.

1300
01:44:45,417 --> 01:44:46,458
Ma!

1301
01:44:51,417 --> 01:44:54,167
That's when Badrinath called
and asked me not to kill her...

1302
01:44:54,458 --> 01:44:55,958
and to send her to him.

1303
01:44:56,875 --> 01:45:01,292
We arranged a corpse matching her
blood group and staged a train accident

1304
01:45:01,625 --> 01:45:03,875
Inspector Rathnavel helped us with it.

1305
01:45:08,208 --> 01:45:11,125
Hey, Inspector, not planning to go inside?

1306
01:45:13,667 --> 01:45:14,833
I'll go in first.

1307
01:45:15,542 --> 01:45:16,917
Judge, sir, please wait.

1308
01:45:17,792 --> 01:45:19,667
I'll show you something more interesting

1309
01:45:31,875 --> 01:45:34,250
Oh, god, let go of me.

1310
01:45:34,667 --> 01:45:36,167
Ma!

1311
01:45:36,833 --> 01:45:38,542
Once I was done with her.

1312
01:45:38,667 --> 01:45:40,500
I sent her to Badrinath.

1313
01:45:41,292 --> 01:45:42,833
Just like what he does with other girls...

1314
01:45:42,958 --> 01:45:45,042
he has her at his ECR godown

1315
01:45:45,208 --> 01:45:46,750
and torturing her sexually.

1316
01:46:09,458 --> 01:46:10,125
Help!

1317
01:46:10,750 --> 01:46:11,833
HELP!

1318
01:46:14,625 --> 01:46:16,750
Please someone save me.

1319
01:46:18,375 --> 01:46:19,500
Help!

1320
01:46:49,375 --> 01:46:52,500
‐Please let me go, I beg you.
‐Easy. Easy!

1321
01:46:52,542 --> 01:46:54,667
Please let me go, please

1322
01:46:54,792 --> 01:46:57,042
‐Please don't, please let me go.
‐Try this, you'll feel better.

1323
01:47:02,708 --> 01:47:05,125
Let go of me...

1324
01:47:07,083 --> 01:47:09,083
Don't! Please let go of me.

1325
01:47:27,250 --> 01:47:30,375
I passed out of IPS with a Gold Medal...

1326
01:47:31,042 --> 01:47:35,125
did you think, I did that to
work with criminals like you?

1327
01:47:35,708 --> 01:47:36,625
Don't!

1328
01:47:37,542 --> 01:47:40,000
I would've killed you the day I met you.

1329
01:47:40,458 --> 01:47:42,167
Badrinath!

1330
01:47:42,875 --> 01:47:44,458
This name...

1331
01:47:44,750 --> 01:47:47,375
I was waiting for this moment.

1332
01:47:49,083 --> 01:47:51,458
Manickavel, please don't kill me.

1333
01:47:51,833 --> 01:47:52,667
Don't!

1334
01:47:53,542 --> 01:47:54,375
Don't!

1335
01:48:03,750 --> 01:48:08,708
"I spotted a streak of fire"

1336
01:48:08,833 --> 01:48:13,667
"I set the same,
raging on to this forest"

1337
01:48:14,292 --> 01:48:18,667
"The forest burned down to the ground"

1338
01:48:18,833 --> 01:48:23,792
"We've left behind the footprint
of bravery"

1339
01:48:35,167 --> 01:48:40,292
"Blazing lightning has struck
the sea to rise high"

1340
01:48:40,375 --> 01:48:45,542
"The sky is becoming clear
with birds chirping songs of hope"

1341
01:48:45,667 --> 01:48:50,042
"I spotted a streak of fire"

1342
01:48:50,333 --> 01:48:55,667
"I set the same,
raging on to this forest"

1343
01:49:30,167 --> 01:49:30,958
Careful...

1344
01:49:32,208 --> 01:49:32,917
Careful!

1345
01:49:36,875 --> 01:49:39,125
Who is this girl
and what happened to her?

1346
01:49:40,083 --> 01:49:41,958
Fine, I'll go and get some water to drink.

1347
01:50:00,667 --> 01:50:01,833
Let go of me!

1348
01:50:03,583 --> 01:50:04,708
Please let go of me.

1349
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:07,000
What happened?

1350
01:50:07,083 --> 01:50:08,542
I can't bear this, let me go.

1351
01:50:08,667 --> 01:50:11,292
Oh, no, nothing dear, don't be scared.

1352
01:50:11,333 --> 01:50:12,875
Nothing's wrong, don't be scared.

1353
01:50:12,958 --> 01:50:14,958
He's your brother, don't be scared.

1354
01:50:15,125 --> 01:50:17,917
Please let go of me...

1355
01:50:18,625 --> 01:50:20,208
‐...please.
‐have some water.

1356
01:50:20,625 --> 01:50:22,292
Take this, nothing to worry.

1357
01:50:22,333 --> 01:50:23,583
Don't be scared, we're here for you.

1358
01:50:43,250 --> 01:50:43,917
Sir.

1359
01:50:44,250 --> 01:50:47,167
Manickavel,
come right away to Badrinath's house

1360
01:50:48,167 --> 01:50:49,292
Home Minister is on the way.

1361
01:50:49,333 --> 01:50:50,625
Come as soon as possible.

1362
01:50:50,833 --> 01:50:53,083
Make sure you're in uniform.

1363
01:51:08,292 --> 01:51:09,125
Brother...

1364
01:51:12,125 --> 01:51:14,250
please kill them all!

1365
01:51:16,792 --> 01:51:18,833
Brother, please kill them all.

1366
01:51:18,958 --> 01:51:20,042
Please brother.

1367
01:51:22,208 --> 01:51:24,542
No other girl should endure
what I went through.

1368
01:51:27,792 --> 01:51:29,375
I should be the last one.

1369
01:51:29,417 --> 01:51:31,667
Please brother, kill them all.

1370
01:51:32,833 --> 01:51:33,917
Please brother.

1371
01:51:52,208 --> 01:51:53,167
Good Morning, Madam.

1372
01:52:07,750 --> 01:52:08,625
Badri!

1373
01:52:10,083 --> 01:52:11,417
Don't worry about anything.

1374
01:52:11,458 --> 01:52:12,667
Everything is under control

1375
01:52:12,792 --> 01:52:14,292
When will you nab that old man?

1376
01:52:14,500 --> 01:52:17,875
Listen Badri, we've made all the
arrangements to catch him.

1377
01:52:17,917 --> 01:52:19,875
We have full support from the Central.

1378
01:52:20,125 --> 01:52:21,083
You don't have to worry.

1379
01:52:21,167 --> 01:52:23,167
When will you nab the old man?

1380
01:52:25,458 --> 01:52:27,542
Badri, please try to understand.

1381
01:52:31,542 --> 01:52:33,667
When will you nab the old man?

1382
01:52:39,833 --> 01:52:41,625
Sir, ma'am is calling you.

1383
01:52:44,083 --> 01:52:44,792
Madam!

1384
01:52:45,750 --> 01:52:49,375
Murthy, why is it so difficult
to catch an old man?

1385
01:52:49,708 --> 01:52:50,583
Who the hell is he?

1386
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:52,708
He's challenging to kill in 12 hours...

1387
01:52:52,750 --> 01:52:54,833
and have been texting
with a deadline.

1388
01:52:55,250 --> 01:52:56,792
Madam, this is a complicated case.

1389
01:52:56,917 --> 01:52:57,958
We're aware of it.

1390
01:52:58,583 --> 01:53:00,583
‐Actually we're trying to‐‐
‐To heck with your try...

1391
01:53:00,667 --> 01:53:03,875
didn't he kill earlier,
just like this after texting?

1392
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:04,750
Yes madam!

1393
01:53:05,167 --> 01:53:05,833
Then?

1394
01:53:08,042 --> 01:53:09,250
Look here, Murthy...

1395
01:53:09,417 --> 01:53:12,000
what happened before in this case

1396
01:53:12,083 --> 01:53:15,417
or what will happen?
I'm not asking you to sketch me a plan.

1397
01:53:15,875 --> 01:53:19,333
He has challenged to kill him by tonight.

1398
01:53:19,500 --> 01:53:21,083
What action have you taken till now?

1399
01:53:21,208 --> 01:53:22,458
After the Judge's murder...

1400
01:53:22,500 --> 01:53:25,542
we have a special team under
Pon Manickavel doing an investigation.

1401
01:53:27,042 --> 01:53:28,292
What did you say his name was?

1402
01:53:28,375 --> 01:53:29,083
Pon Manickavel.

1403
01:53:29,125 --> 01:53:30,917
Ah... Pon Manickavel.

1404
01:53:31,292 --> 01:53:33,625
Where is he?
I wanna see him right now.

1405
01:53:33,958 --> 01:53:36,458
I've already informed him,
he's on his way.

1406
01:53:44,167 --> 01:53:45,167
Sir!

1407
01:53:49,625 --> 01:53:51,375
Badri, please relax.

1408
01:54:03,542 --> 01:54:05,042
‐Sir!
‐Mmmm.

1409
01:54:08,167 --> 01:54:08,792
Ma'am!

1410
01:54:09,167 --> 01:54:12,167
Madam, he's been handling the case
since the beginning.

1411
01:54:12,250 --> 01:54:14,625
Very brilliant, he cracked all
the loop holes in this case.

1412
01:54:14,708 --> 01:54:16,208
But he hasn't caught the old man.

1413
01:54:17,250 --> 01:54:18,958
I don't need to hear his history.

1414
01:54:19,583 --> 01:54:23,000
Manickavel, from now on
Tilak is in‐charge of this case.

1415
01:54:23,583 --> 01:54:27,542
It's enough you assist him with what
he needs in regards to this case.

1416
01:54:28,833 --> 01:54:30,333
‐Sir?
‐Hey!

1417
01:54:32,958 --> 01:54:33,875
Out!

1418
01:54:40,292 --> 01:54:41,125
Sorry.

1419
01:54:51,833 --> 01:54:53,625
So, you're that Pon Manickavel.

1420
01:54:53,792 --> 01:54:55,708
Why can't you just shoot an old man?

1421
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,250
I'll nab that old man by tonight.

1422
01:54:58,375 --> 01:54:59,708
Just watch.

1423
01:55:08,792 --> 01:55:12,083
As I said earlier, those variants of guns,
we're not importing anymore...

1424
01:55:12,208 --> 01:55:13,875
'cause of its complicated handling.

1425
01:55:13,958 --> 01:55:15,583
Can I have the list of gun owners?

1426
01:55:15,750 --> 01:55:18,083
And is it still being used
by any of the officers?

1427
01:55:18,292 --> 01:55:19,833
No, I don't think so.

1428
01:55:20,208 --> 01:55:21,333
Wait, wait, wait!

1429
01:55:22,167 --> 01:55:24,333
I think there was a batch in 2009.

1430
01:55:24,417 --> 01:55:28,792
We've given M55 gun for training at IDA.

1431
01:55:29,125 --> 01:55:31,000
Okay, can I have that list of names?

1432
01:55:31,125 --> 01:55:33,042
I'll try and send you that, yeah.

1433
01:55:46,708 --> 01:55:48,583
‐Thank you.
‐Okay, okay, madam.

1434
01:55:48,667 --> 01:55:49,500
Welcome Madam.

1435
01:55:50,958 --> 01:55:52,667
‐One minute... uh.
‐Okay, Madam.

1436
01:56:01,292 --> 01:56:01,917
Hello!

1437
01:56:02,125 --> 01:56:04,250
Badri, hope the security is fine?

1438
01:56:04,417 --> 01:56:06,000
Everything is alright...

1439
01:56:06,167 --> 01:56:07,167
but the Police

1440
01:56:07,583 --> 01:56:10,167
no matter how much you pet the snake

1441
01:56:10,750 --> 01:56:13,333
it tends to bite back one day

1442
01:56:13,792 --> 01:56:14,875
that's the nature you know.

1443
01:56:15,042 --> 01:56:16,500
Badri any issues?

1444
01:56:19,417 --> 01:56:22,083
Even if there is a single small issue...

1445
01:56:29,083 --> 01:56:30,625
even if the God decides to appear

1446
01:56:30,750 --> 01:56:32,250
can't do squat to me.

1447
01:56:35,625 --> 01:56:38,125
Sir, there are security cameras
around the house...

1448
01:56:38,208 --> 01:56:41,167
and constables are posted
at every nook and corner.

1449
01:56:41,292 --> 01:56:43,625
There are drones flying
around the house...

1450
01:56:43,708 --> 01:56:45,167
spread across the area.

1451
01:56:51,750 --> 01:56:54,667
Sir, we have everything under control.

1452
01:56:54,875 --> 01:56:56,250
You don't have to worry about anything,

1453
01:56:56,417 --> 01:56:57,958
I don't trust your department...

1454
01:56:58,833 --> 01:57:00,250
but I trust you!

1455
01:57:00,667 --> 01:57:01,458
Thank you, sir.

1456
01:57:02,083 --> 01:57:02,833
Sir!

1457
01:57:03,167 --> 01:57:04,208
Sir, come inside.

1458
01:57:04,333 --> 01:57:05,625
Yes, cover him completely.

1459
01:57:06,042 --> 01:57:08,375
‐Sir, he's leaving.
‐Oh, God!

1460
01:57:08,625 --> 01:57:10,208
Come on quick, come on, come on.

1461
01:57:10,500 --> 01:57:11,375
From which directions was it fired?

1462
01:57:11,417 --> 01:57:13,125
it came from the rooftop, sir.

1463
01:57:13,250 --> 01:57:15,042
I think it's was from North East Direction.

1464
01:57:15,125 --> 01:57:17,000
‐Badrinath, please stay.
‐Sir, please stay.

1465
01:57:17,625 --> 01:57:19,667
‐Badrinath.
‐Sir, I have everything under control.

1466
01:57:19,667 --> 01:57:20,792
You don't have to worry about it.

1467
01:57:20,875 --> 01:57:21,917
Sir, I...

1468
01:57:22,042 --> 01:57:23,875
Sir, it's not safe outside

1469
01:57:23,958 --> 01:57:25,208
Ma'am, Mr. Badri is leaving.

1470
01:57:25,333 --> 01:57:27,167
Tilak, where he feels it's comfortable

1471
01:57:27,167 --> 01:57:28,625
you get there and protect him.

1472
01:57:28,667 --> 01:57:30,083
Yes Ma'am, I'm following him.

1473
01:57:30,125 --> 01:57:31,333
‐Okay, do it.
‐Sure ma'am.

1474
01:57:31,417 --> 01:57:32,958
Move, move, move everyone!

1475
01:57:46,125 --> 01:57:48,000
Sir, Bhoominathan who was in prison

1476
01:57:48,083 --> 01:57:50,250
works at Mani workshop at Royapuram

1477
01:57:50,250 --> 01:57:51,542
that's what his brother mentioned,

1478
01:57:52,292 --> 01:57:54,292
Sir, he hardly speaks to anyone...

1479
01:57:54,375 --> 01:57:56,458
but doesn't fail to pay 5 times,
and keeps it to himself.

1480
01:57:56,542 --> 01:57:58,792
Think harder, it's an important case.

1481
01:57:58,833 --> 01:58:02,583
Sir, even Pon Manickavel was our cell mate.

1482
01:58:05,750 --> 01:58:07,208
Did you say Pon Manickavel?

1483
01:58:07,292 --> 01:58:09,333
Yes sir, he's from your department.

1484
01:58:16,625 --> 01:58:17,583
Tell me, Kailash, sir

1485
01:58:17,667 --> 01:58:19,792
Did Pon Manickavel serve time
at Salem prison?

1486
01:58:19,917 --> 01:58:20,667
Yes, sir.

1487
01:58:20,750 --> 01:58:22,958
Asst. Commissioner Pon Manickavel

1488
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:25,083
was careless during his duty

1489
01:58:25,125 --> 01:58:26,917
and was irresponsible

1490
01:58:27,208 --> 01:58:29,333
that made him responsible
for loss of a life.

1491
01:58:29,375 --> 01:58:31,500
According to IPC section 287

1492
01:58:31,583 --> 01:58:35,417
this court sentences him to
the prison for 6 months.

1493
01:58:35,542 --> 01:58:37,333
Hey, why didn't you mention this earlier?

1494
01:58:37,417 --> 01:58:40,542
Sir, earlier you just asked
about Nasrathullah.

1495
01:58:40,750 --> 01:58:42,583
Only now you inquired about
Pon Manickavel.

1496
01:58:42,667 --> 01:58:44,208
So, I've mentioned everything about him.

1497
01:58:44,292 --> 01:58:46,625
Tomorrow, if you ask about Palanisami,
then I will speak about him.

1498
01:58:46,708 --> 01:58:47,917
Hang up, damn it.

1499
01:58:54,042 --> 01:58:55,208
Guys seal this place right now.

1500
01:58:55,250 --> 01:58:57,042
‐Don't worry, sir, we're armed.
‐Okay.

1501
01:58:57,958 --> 01:58:59,000
Come on, guys!

1502
01:59:15,583 --> 01:59:17,375
Sir, where did he go?

1503
01:59:17,583 --> 01:59:19,542
‐Where is he?
‐Where's your boss?

1504
01:59:20,667 --> 01:59:21,417
Sir!

1505
01:59:21,875 --> 01:59:23,792
Tell me, tell me damn it.

1506
01:59:35,083 --> 01:59:36,875
Sir, sorry about what happened out there.

1507
01:59:37,042 --> 01:59:38,292
I have secured this place.

1508
01:59:38,417 --> 01:59:40,000
Hey... you fools!

1509
01:59:40,083 --> 01:59:41,083
Why are you guys here?

1510
01:59:41,333 --> 01:59:42,875
Go and protect everything upstairs.

1511
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:44,292
I don't want your protection here.

1512
01:59:44,375 --> 01:59:45,750
Get out! Out!

1513
01:59:47,125 --> 01:59:48,000
Out!

1514
02:00:02,875 --> 02:00:03,542
Hello...

1515
02:00:03,583 --> 02:00:06,333
did you collect the details
of the cases dealt by Pon Manickavel?

1516
02:00:06,583 --> 02:00:09,458
Sir, when he was stationed in Targakapatti
of Salem district...

1517
02:00:09,583 --> 02:00:11,125
handled 7 cases in total

1518
02:00:11,250 --> 02:00:13,250
from which 4 were sentenced to prison.

1519
02:00:13,625 --> 02:00:16,875
Remaining 3 got out using their influence.

1520
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:18,958
Give the contact numbers of those 3 people.

1521
02:00:19,042 --> 02:00:21,417
Sorry sir, those 3 died recently.

1522
02:00:21,542 --> 02:00:22,333
How did that happen?

1523
02:00:22,375 --> 02:00:25,917
In one case,
brother of the accused killed him.

1524
02:00:30,750 --> 02:00:33,167
In another case,
the accused got killed by his enemy.

1525
02:00:35,750 --> 02:00:37,875
And the third committed a suicide

1526
02:00:38,208 --> 02:00:39,542
Is there a co‐incidence among them?

1527
02:00:39,625 --> 02:00:42,208
All of them were shot dead.

1528
02:00:42,292 --> 02:00:43,625
Nothing else is common in the case.

1529
02:00:43,792 --> 02:00:45,458
‐Gun shot?
‐Yes, sir.

1530
02:00:45,667 --> 02:00:49,083
Can you mail me the death and
forensic report immediately?

1531
02:00:51,667 --> 02:00:53,542
Tilak, is everything okay?

1532
02:00:53,833 --> 02:00:57,250
Yes, sir, he has a perfect bunker
built in the basement.

1533
02:01:02,708 --> 02:01:04,000
Oh, God!

1534
02:01:13,833 --> 02:01:14,958
‐Nanda, cover him.

1535
02:01:16,708 --> 02:01:19,750
‐What's going on?
‐Sir, sir, sir, please go inside.

1536
02:01:21,625 --> 02:01:23,917
Don't come out, go inside quick.

1537
02:01:40,250 --> 02:01:41,417
We couldn't find any bullets.

1538
02:01:41,500 --> 02:01:44,000
It's difficult to use them
without proper training,

1539
02:01:44,042 --> 02:01:45,708
Pon Manickavel,
is a great gun specialist.

1540
02:01:45,792 --> 02:01:48,208
Everyone of them was shot dead!

1541
02:01:48,292 --> 02:01:49,833
Nothing else is common in the case.

1542
02:01:49,875 --> 02:01:52,042
You won't understand,
until you experience it

1543
02:02:07,875 --> 02:02:10,208
You... Manickavel?

1544
02:02:10,708 --> 02:02:11,875
How come you're here?

1545
02:02:12,833 --> 02:02:15,458
What's happening?
Has that old man arrived?

1546
02:02:15,500 --> 02:02:16,167
Huh?

1547
02:02:16,583 --> 02:02:18,625
Hey, say something.

1548
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:22,250
I've just sent you the list of 2009 batch
from IDA training.

1549
02:02:22,292 --> 02:02:23,625
Please check you email.

1550
02:02:31,667 --> 02:02:33,542
Badrinath!

1551
02:02:34,833 --> 02:02:38,042
Even if the sinner tries to evade everyone...

1552
02:02:39,250 --> 02:02:41,792
can't escape the clutches of the God.

1553
02:02:45,958 --> 02:02:48,833
In one case,
brother of the accused killed him.

1554
02:02:55,708 --> 02:02:58,417
In another case,
the accused got killed by his enemy.

1555
02:02:59,167 --> 02:03:02,125
God won't appear
for anything and everything.

1556
02:03:02,708 --> 02:03:04,417
Instead sends avatars of himself.

1557
02:03:04,833 --> 02:03:06,917
And the third committed a suicide

1558
02:03:10,458 --> 02:03:11,708
If not...

1559
02:03:16,167 --> 02:03:19,042
he might appear as Manickavel too.

1560
02:03:28,750 --> 02:03:31,333
Hey, hey... please don't kill me!

1561
02:03:31,667 --> 02:03:33,583
Brother, please kill them.

1562
02:03:34,125 --> 02:03:35,542
Hey, hey, hey...

1563
02:03:35,917 --> 02:03:37,375
‐No!
‐Shoot them, sir.

1564
02:03:37,542 --> 02:03:39,833
"No other girl should endure
what I went through."

1565
02:03:41,042 --> 02:03:42,750
‐No...
‐Shoot them, sir.

1566
02:04:00,417 --> 02:04:01,250
Sir!

1567
02:04:06,708 --> 02:04:10,958
I did try to catch the old man alive...

1568
02:04:11,792 --> 02:04:14,292
but he...

1569
02:04:14,958 --> 02:04:16,708
shot down, Badrinath

1570
02:04:17,208 --> 02:04:18,500
and was going to shoot me.

1571
02:04:18,583 --> 02:04:19,750
As a precaution...

1572
02:04:21,958 --> 02:04:23,875
I had to shoot him down.

1573
02:04:28,417 --> 02:04:30,250
‐Brilliant job, Manickavel.
‐Thank you, sir.

1574
02:04:30,625 --> 02:04:32,500
‐Call the ambulance and clear the body.
‐Congratulations. Well done!

1575
02:05:11,917 --> 02:05:14,667
Sir, my name is Nasrathullah.

1576
02:05:33,208 --> 02:05:36,083
Sir, I got a threatening message
from an unknown number.

1577
02:05:36,250 --> 02:05:37,792
Okay, I'll be right there.

1578
02:05:39,208 --> 02:05:40,417
What's your car number?

1579
02:05:52,375 --> 02:05:53,417
Why do you have to do it?

1580
02:05:53,542 --> 02:05:55,708
I want to kill them with my bare hands.

1581
02:06:04,583 --> 02:06:07,958
Manickavel, from now on Tilak
is in‐charge of this case.

1582
02:06:11,083 --> 02:06:12,750
Badri, any issues?

1583
02:06:15,917 --> 02:06:18,458
Even if there's a single small issue...

1584
02:06:18,875 --> 02:06:21,958
there's my personal guest house for safety.

1585
02:06:22,042 --> 02:06:24,458
My underground lair,
I'll go there.

1586
02:06:24,708 --> 02:06:28,708
Even if the God plans to appear,
can't do squat about it.

1587
02:06:29,708 --> 02:06:33,708
Brother, I need a corpse with
O+ve matching his body type.

1588
02:07:11,667 --> 02:07:14,208
I've made all the arrangements
you might require at Mangalore.

1589
02:07:14,708 --> 02:07:17,708
Sister, you can continue your course
out there.

1590
02:07:17,750 --> 02:07:18,958
Thank you, brother.

1591
02:07:19,542 --> 02:07:20,458
What's wrong with you?

1592
02:07:20,833 --> 02:07:22,042
Best of luck!

1593
02:07:22,917 --> 02:07:24,750
Congrats, Pon Manickavel, sir

1594
02:07:27,042 --> 02:07:29,542
You cleverly erased all the evidence.

1595
02:07:30,042 --> 02:07:31,875
But that's not the end of the story.

1596
02:07:33,375 --> 02:07:35,042
I'll get hold of at least one evidence.

1597
02:07:35,417 --> 02:07:38,625
And arrest you before I retire
from the service.

1598
02:07:40,875 --> 02:07:42,000
Best of luck!

1599
02:07:43,875 --> 02:07:46,417
Keep gawking,
I'll buy you chickpeas.

1600
02:07:48,333 --> 02:07:51,083
It's true that Police Department
does its duty.

1601
02:07:51,500 --> 02:07:53,833
But who do they serve?

1602
02:07:54,125 --> 02:07:55,208
Is it for the department?

1603
02:07:55,583 --> 02:07:56,625
Or for the politicians?

1604
02:07:57,042 --> 02:07:58,208
Or do they serve the public?

1605
02:07:58,500 --> 02:08:01,250
I got a reply for that question
in spur of that moment

1606
02:08:01,583 --> 02:08:03,750
To which my conscience supports...

1607
02:08:04,042 --> 02:08:05,792
I'll lean towards it
in accordance to the truth...

1608
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:07,208
in accordance to righteousness

1609
02:08:07,542 --> 02:08:10,375
I will perform my duties
until my last breath.

1610
02:08:10,792 --> 02:08:12,250
So it's just a beginning.

1611
02:08:12,583 --> 02:08:14,667
Long way to devil's road!

1612
