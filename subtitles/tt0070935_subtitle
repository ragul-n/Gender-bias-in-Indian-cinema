1
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:52,104
First, cut the cake for the children. 
Do the rest later.

2
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:54,769
No mother.  First thing is music.
Then only we eat.

3
00:02:55,575 --> 00:03:00,512
Okay son. Kamla, sing that song today
which always sing.

4
00:03:00,614 --> 00:03:01,776
Okay.

5
00:03:02,616 --> 00:03:05,084
- Shankar, Ratan, Vijay ...  ready? 
- Yes mother.

6
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:07,080
I will also get ready.

7
00:07:08,861 --> 00:07:13,298
This is terrible.  A man killed 
Dharampal and robbed his house!

8
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:15,291
- Who was he? 
- Who knows?

9
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:30,178
I thought their intention was just stealing...

10
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:32,748
But killing ...

11
00:07:39,425 --> 00:07:40,858
You can not take a life ...

12
00:07:52,905 --> 00:07:56,204
Mr.Shakal, first time in my life I see this ...

13
00:07:57,176 --> 00:08:00,304
You are using shoe number 8 for one foot
and number 9 on the other...

14
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,314
It's so from his childhood.

15
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:07,310
He always wears size 8 in
one foot and 9 in the other.

16
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:10,855
What are you thinking of?

17
00:08:12,925 --> 00:08:17,862
About the man whom I barged
into while making a getaway.

18
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:21,366
He saw my face clearly.

19
00:08:23,102 --> 00:08:25,366
And he was a painter.

20
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:29,374
Inspector' I'm an artist.

21
00:08:30,443 --> 00:08:32,877
I clearly recall the face
of the man I collided with.

22
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:38,884
I can paint his portrait by memory.

23
00:08:49,161 --> 00:08:51,095
You are extremely talented.

24
00:08:52,498 --> 00:08:55,934
One look and you painted
such a true picture.

25
00:08:57,503 --> 00:08:58,902
Wait...

26
00:08:59,505 --> 00:09:00,870
What happened?

27
00:09:41,013 --> 00:09:43,447
Children... don't be scared.

28
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:46,279
Listen... escape that way.

29
00:09:55,061 --> 00:09:56,995
- Where are the kids?
- They went that way.

30
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:32,558
Hurry!

31
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:43,973
Brother!

32
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:04,293
Do you recognise this man?

33
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:11,902
Yes' he was with the man who fired.

34
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,406
His name is Jack and
we've arrested him.

35
00:11:19,645 --> 00:11:22,580
We got the finger prints
of the other man too.

36
00:11:23,315 --> 00:11:25,579
But Jack refuses to name his partner.

37
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:28,119
Who probably is the real killer.

38
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:32,021
Any news of Shankar and Vijay?

39
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,125
No but we continue the search.

40
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:37,629
Keep this child with you.
We'll inform you later.

41
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,290
Very well.
Come on' son.

42
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,970
- Who is he?
- No idea.

43
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,403
- He was fighting. He's drunk.
- Quiet.

44
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,906
Keep him locked
till he sobers down.

45
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:57,649
- Come on.
- Let me go...

46
00:11:58,751 --> 00:12:01,948
This is not my room.
Where's the air conditioned room?

47
00:12:02,688 --> 00:12:04,622
- Shut up.
- Why must I shut up?

48
00:12:11,363 --> 00:12:13,297
Shakal sent me.

49
00:12:15,701 --> 00:12:18,363
If you tell the police about Shakal...

50
00:12:18,704 --> 00:12:21,639
Your little daughter will be killed!

51
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:27,145
- My child?
- Yes. Your little daughter.

52
00:12:28,714 --> 00:12:31,683
Don't do this.

53
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,689
Stop... stop the tango.

54
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,204
Give me the pineapple.

55
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:00,969
- It costs 2 bucks. Want it?
- Give it for 25 paise.

56
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,972
Get lost! Wants to eat pineapple!

57
00:13:03,215 --> 00:13:05,649
Do you get them for 25 p?
Wants to buy a pineapple!

58
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:36,372
Are you hungry?

59
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:40,379
I'll just arrange it.

60
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:45,587
- My name is Usman Batliwala.
- I am Shankar.

61
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:47,156
Will do.

62
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:51,763
Come with me. When I wink'
quickly pick two potato dumplings.

63
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,706
All right I'll pay
2 bucks. Get it down.

64
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:08,212
Robber! Just you wait!

65
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:13,115
Thief! Somebody catch him!

66
00:16:22,581 --> 00:16:23,843
Brother!

67
00:17:23,642 --> 00:17:24,904
Trunk call for you from Mahabaleshwar

68
00:17:27,646 --> 00:17:28,908
Father? Yes?

69
00:17:29,314 --> 00:17:33,410
Congratulations. I read about
your passing in the papers.

70
00:17:35,687 --> 00:17:38,952
- When are you coming here?
- On Sunday.

71
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:49,763
Where have you been?
We've been waiting for long.

72
00:17:50,035 --> 00:17:52,629
- What's the matter?
- Caught a scape goat.

73
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:56,303
It's Lord Byron's birthday.
He's treating us to dinner.

74
00:17:56,542 --> 00:17:58,476
- Where are we going?
- Hotel Blue Heaven...

75
00:17:58,710 --> 00:17:59,972
Do you know who's singing there?

76
00:19:03,442 --> 00:19:04,966
Sir' there's a call for you.

77
00:19:06,044 --> 00:19:09,309
Must be Sharma. Have to
return his motorcycle.

78
00:19:09,715 --> 00:19:10,977
I'll just get back.

79
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:16,646
Before I play the next number'
I'll play an incomplete one.

80
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:18,979
This song is 15 years old.

81
00:19:20,092 --> 00:19:23,027
Only 2 persons in this
world can complete it.

82
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:26,030
I am looking for them.

83
00:21:08,233 --> 00:21:11,498
I play the next number for
the two beautiful young hearts...

84
00:21:12,237 --> 00:21:13,499
...that are in front of me.

85
00:21:14,239 --> 00:21:15,672
The words go...

86
00:21:17,242 --> 00:21:18,641
You know the words well.

87
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:55,968
The one in the red dress...

88
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:59,970
- Me...?
- Yes.

89
00:23:00,312 --> 00:23:01,745
Will you come up here?

90
00:23:21,366 --> 00:23:25,132
- What's your name?
- My name... Sunita.

91
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:29,301
Will you sing with me?

92
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:31,308
No... I'm scared...

93
00:23:32,778 --> 00:23:34,803
Why must you be scared?
I will sing with you.

94
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:44,684
Is it okay?

95
00:23:49,828 --> 00:23:51,193
Sing with the words.

96
00:25:34,499 --> 00:25:37,832
If they can sing with me'
why can't all of you?

97
00:29:00,638 --> 00:29:04,574
- Mother Rosie' then...?
- I often went to the police station.

98
00:29:05,643 --> 00:29:07,235
But found no news
of Shankar or Vijay.

99
00:29:08,313 --> 00:29:10,178
And Jack' whom the
police had arrested?

100
00:29:11,649 --> 00:29:13,116
He was sentenced for 15 years.

101
00:29:13,685 --> 00:29:15,414
He's probably still in jail.

102
00:29:16,688 --> 00:29:18,019
In jail...?

103
00:29:19,691 --> 00:29:20,953
In jail.

104
00:29:23,695 --> 00:29:25,026
I'm here to see Jack.

105
00:29:25,697 --> 00:29:27,358
Jack is very unwell.

106
00:29:28,199 --> 00:29:30,133
The doctor has asked him
not to meet anyone.

107
00:29:30,702 --> 00:29:33,034
- When can I see him?
- After a few days.

108
00:29:39,711 --> 00:29:41,906
This man always comes to see Jack.

109
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:45,315
- I always have to make excuses.
- Who is he?

110
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:47,047
Who knows?

111
00:30:06,771 --> 00:30:08,363
Brother!

112
00:30:55,887 --> 00:30:57,821
Why are you looking at me like this?

113
00:30:58,389 --> 00:31:00,584
It's me. Usman Batliwala.

114
00:31:04,829 --> 00:31:06,421
Why were you sitting in the dark?

115
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,432
The first sip always stinks.

116
00:31:20,845 --> 00:31:24,042
I know about all that
occurred in your life.

117
00:31:24,849 --> 00:31:27,443
But will thinking about it
all the time help you?

118
00:31:29,621 --> 00:31:30,781
The murderer of my parents...

119
00:31:31,289 --> 00:31:33,780
You know neither his
face nor his name.

120
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:37,157
Someday I will find him.

121
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:38,824
How?

122
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:44,335
You know the killer wasn't alone.

123
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:47,428
Yes I know. A man
named Jack was with him.

124
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:49,237
He's in jail for the past 15 years.

125
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:52,175
Some day he will be released.

126
00:31:53,645 --> 00:31:58,582
The day he gets out' it will
be his neck and my hands.

127
00:31:59,951 --> 00:32:01,816
He will have to tell me
who the murderer is.

128
00:32:02,887 --> 00:32:05,822
- And then...
- You will kill the killer.

129
00:32:07,892 --> 00:32:09,257
Do you know the outcome of that?

130
00:32:09,894 --> 00:32:12,556
Yes. Death.

131
00:32:13,498 --> 00:32:14,829
But who wants to live?

132
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:19,597
My life has but one aim. Revenge!

133
00:32:21,906 --> 00:32:23,840
I have another prayer to the Lord.

134
00:32:24,909 --> 00:32:28,845
I wish to meet my
brothers before I die.

135
00:32:30,581 --> 00:32:31,843
My dear Ratan...

136
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:36,284
I want nothing else.

137
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:40,857
- Nothing at all...
- Hello. May I come in?

138
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,894
Come in and sit down.

139
00:32:44,362 --> 00:32:47,559
- What's the news?
- Good enough to make you happy.

140
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:49,899
Look at this...

141
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:53,903
There's a grand reception for
her daughter tomorrow night.

142
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:58,909
Use your brains. Take a look
at the Queen's necklace.

143
00:33:02,914 --> 00:33:05,439
Shankar! Take a look...

144
00:33:16,961 --> 00:33:18,394
Well done' son.

145
00:33:19,364 --> 00:33:20,888
I'm proud of you.

146
00:33:22,967 --> 00:33:27,563
I've inquired from Robert. This
necklace costs 500000 outside India.

147
00:33:28,973 --> 00:33:30,406
When is Robert coming?

148
00:33:31,376 --> 00:33:34,311
You know how smart the
police have become.

149
00:33:34,979 --> 00:33:36,708
Robert comes from outside India.

150
00:33:37,582 --> 00:33:40,676
Risking his life' he lands
his little plane in anywhere.

151
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:44,284
Unless we have goods worth
50 to 60 lakhs to give him...

152
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:46,285
He's not ready to come.

153
00:33:49,427 --> 00:33:50,951
What's our stock position?

154
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:54,965
The 600 year old
ancient idols we got...

155
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:56,958
They alone are worth 30 lakhs.

156
00:33:57,535 --> 00:33:58,797
There's other stuff too.

157
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:00,561
This necklace too will be ours.

158
00:34:23,027 --> 00:34:24,961
- Briefed them?
- Absolutely.

159
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:27,964
The wedding reception
is at Bright Hotel.

160
00:34:30,034 --> 00:34:31,296
This is the map of the hall.

161
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:09,472
Congratulations.

162
00:35:21,486 --> 00:35:23,579
Excuse me. I slipped...

163
00:35:23,821 --> 00:35:25,618
- Hope you're not hurt.
- No.

164
00:35:27,091 --> 00:35:29,025
My necklace!

165
00:35:33,764 --> 00:35:35,026
Who could have taken it?

166
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:01,708
They will break down the door.

167
00:37:20,171 --> 00:37:22,901
A man committed theft and
escaped. We think he came here.

168
00:37:23,174 --> 00:37:24,505
Nobody came here.

169
00:37:29,847 --> 00:37:31,109
We'll meet again.

170
00:37:43,227 --> 00:37:44,819
Not this way...
Take the back door.

171
00:37:54,238 --> 00:37:56,001
Take some constables
and go to Bright Hotel.

172
00:37:56,574 --> 00:37:58,007
Somebody stole the Queen of
Behrampur's necklace.

173
00:37:58,242 --> 00:37:59,675
Make complete inquiries.
Do you understand?

174
00:38:39,283 --> 00:38:41,513
Manager' you're a lazy man!

175
00:38:42,286 --> 00:38:45,050
I'd told you at 4 that my
friends are coming from Bombay.

176
00:38:45,289 --> 00:38:47,223
The guests have arrived
but your not ready for them.

177
00:38:48,292 --> 00:38:50,624
Everything is arranged.
Food and cold drinks.

178
00:38:51,962 --> 00:38:53,224
I mean hot drinks!

179
00:38:53,798 --> 00:38:55,231
Some of my friends
drink whisky and beer.

180
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:58,564
- I'll get them right away.
- Please hurry.

181
00:39:01,238 --> 00:39:02,671
Dad!

182
00:39:07,244 --> 00:39:09,906
- How are you?
- First class. Fine.

183
00:39:11,248 --> 00:39:13,842
- What a racket!
- What do you know?

184
00:39:14,285 --> 00:39:17,220
Our master sold this house
to a Devidayal from Bombay.

185
00:39:18,289 --> 00:39:20,553
His daughter' Sunita
landed up out of the blue.

186
00:39:21,292 --> 00:39:23,886
Not alone. Some other boys
and girls too have come.

187
00:39:24,628 --> 00:39:25,959
They're having a house-warming party.

188
00:39:26,297 --> 00:39:30,734
You sit in my room. I've
got to go to the market.

189
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:34,227
Dad' you won't return to
the room before midnight.

190
00:39:35,306 --> 00:39:38,742
You have lots of work.
I'll meet Saleem by then.

191
00:39:38,976 --> 00:39:40,910
Yes. He misses you.

192
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:45,749
He's got a Rs. 300 job as
Secretary to Kunwar Vijay Kumar.

193
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:47,908
He's got a place to stay in
at the same bungalow.

194
00:40:00,364 --> 00:40:01,956
Good day...

195
00:40:03,367 --> 00:40:06,962
- My pal! Where were you?
- Hello' sister-in-law.

196
00:40:07,371 --> 00:40:09,635
Believe me' we were
talking about you.

197
00:40:11,375 --> 00:40:15,311
This is my wife's elder brother.

198
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:17,813
He's here for the vacation.

199
00:40:18,382 --> 00:40:21,977
If it wasn't' for Vijay'
I wouldn't have married Najma.

200
00:40:23,821 --> 00:40:25,083
I know everything. Isn't it?

201
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:28,122
See you later.

202
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:32,862
Take a seat.
I'll make you some tea.

203
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:38,026
Sit down. Why are you standing?

204
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:42,963
So' how are things with you?

205
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:46,375
I'm in a fix.

206
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:48,711
- Must concern a girl.
- Listen to me.

207
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:51,381
I met a girl in Bombay.

208
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:53,215
As usual' we played pranks.

209
00:40:53,884 --> 00:40:55,875
I come here to see her as my mistress.

210
00:40:56,487 --> 00:41:00,321
The way she was ordering Dad'
I had to swallow my anger.

211
00:41:02,426 --> 00:41:04,018
Your mistress is throwing
a house-warming party.

212
00:41:04,829 --> 00:41:06,956
She'd invited my master
and he was to attend.

213
00:41:07,431 --> 00:41:08,955
But he had to leave for Madras.

214
00:41:09,433 --> 00:41:12,368
- Does she know him?
- She's heard not seen him.

215
00:41:12,937 --> 00:41:16,373
He's the richest man here.
Fond of poetry. So she's called him.

216
00:41:20,444 --> 00:41:23,311
- What size is he?
- About your size.

217
00:41:23,781 --> 00:41:26,215
- What clothes does he wear?
- The best of suits.

218
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:29,419
The key of his wardrobe...

219
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:34,423
Now I get it...

220
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:37,757
You're planning to get me sacked.

221
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:57,105
When is that Kunwar coming?

222
00:41:57,515 --> 00:42:01,383
I don't even know him. Daddy said
invite him if you're throwing a party.

223
00:42:01,886 --> 00:42:04,980
He's such a good poet that
it adds colour to the party.

224
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:09,758
We came for you all the way from
Bombay. Doesn't that mean anything?

225
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:14,426
Good God! What a shortage
of good boys in this world.

226
00:42:15,499 --> 00:42:16,830
Silly jokes all the time.

227
00:42:18,502 --> 00:42:20,094
They romance as if
they are chucking stones.

228
00:42:20,838 --> 00:42:22,772
Do you have an answer to this?

229
00:42:23,173 --> 00:42:26,438
I'd like to ask you if you
found somebody of your standard.

230
00:42:27,511 --> 00:42:30,446
He's feeling bad.
I'll burn him some more.

231
00:42:32,516 --> 00:42:37,112
You talk of meeting somebody.
Yes' I did meet a boy.

232
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:40,956
In Bombay. He was
riding his motorcycle.

233
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:42,924
I was driving my car.

234
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:45,893
Our eyes met...

235
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:48,498
He had these wonderful eyes...!

236
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:50,499
I fell for him right there!

237
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:54,170
What did he look like?

238
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:57,507
His face' features... Wow!

239
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:01,875
He walked as if spring came.

240
00:43:02,513 --> 00:43:06,210
If I shut my eyes'
even now I can see him.

241
00:43:06,884 --> 00:43:08,112
Tall...

242
00:43:08,552 --> 00:43:11,487
Broad chest...
Smiling eyes...

243
00:43:12,556 --> 00:43:14,888
Mischief on his lips
as if he were saying...

244
00:43:16,226 --> 00:43:17,488
Did you think of me?

245
00:43:19,229 --> 00:43:20,491
You...??

246
00:43:22,566 --> 00:43:25,160
Are you Kunwar?

247
00:43:25,569 --> 00:43:29,505
Kunwar for others.
Just Vijay for you.

248
00:43:35,312 --> 00:43:38,281
Friends' this is Kunwar Vijay
and these are my college friends.

249
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:42,245
Take a seat. I'll join you.

250
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:49,957
I'm in a fix! The boy
I mentioned to burn Chintu...

251
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:52,562
This Kunwar is the same guy!

252
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:54,563
- So what?
- Silly woman!

253
00:43:55,032 --> 00:43:56,897
He must think I was
really praising him!

254
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:01,164
See' how he's looking at me!

255
00:44:01,572 --> 00:44:02,834
As if I'm in love with him!

256
00:44:03,574 --> 00:44:05,508
- Donkey!
- Doesn't look like one.

257
00:44:06,577 --> 00:44:09,011
- Shall I make him one?
- He's not easy to fool.

258
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:11,514
- He's very smart.
- Is that so?

259
00:44:11,915 --> 00:44:14,110
Watch me. Give me whisky.

260
00:44:24,628 --> 00:44:26,061
Your whisky.

261
00:44:28,298 --> 00:44:29,560
What are you drinking?

262
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:31,892
- I don't drink liquor.
- No?

263
00:44:33,637 --> 00:44:37,073
If it was duty' you could
have given me anything to drink.

264
00:44:38,308 --> 00:44:40,572
If you ran out of wine'
you could've added water.

265
00:44:41,645 --> 00:44:45,240
Life is not but a high.

266
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:47,583
Can I help it if you can't drink?

267
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:50,119
Very well said!

268
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:53,080
- I too don't drink liquor.
- Why?

269
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:56,626
My dear grandfather used to say...

270
00:44:57,695 --> 00:45:01,563
Those who drink from thine eyes'
water is liquor for them.

271
00:45:04,635 --> 00:45:07,570
You're great! You said
everything in these words.

272
00:45:08,138 --> 00:45:09,571
But one must understand.

273
00:45:10,641 --> 00:45:13,405
Answer him. He's
thrown you a challenge.

274
00:45:13,644 --> 00:45:14,975
I wish I could strangle him!

275
00:45:16,647 --> 00:45:21,584
Hear this... if all the
fights are because I live...

276
00:45:22,352 --> 00:45:25,321
Then strangle me for
I too am desperate.

277
00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:29,625
I can't take my own life.

278
00:45:30,694 --> 00:45:32,127
If death doesn't come'
what can I do?

279
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:38,634
- Should I answer?
- Sure.

280
00:45:39,036 --> 00:45:40,367
Will you wait for 2 minutes?

281
00:45:42,372 --> 00:45:43,634
Please hurry back.

282
00:45:51,715 --> 00:45:54,684
Mister' finally you ruined
the party. She's gone to bed.

283
00:45:56,754 --> 00:46:01,020
Any party I go to'
people awake not fall asleep.

284
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,473
What's the matter?

285
00:50:45,042 --> 00:50:46,304
Nothing.

286
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:48,973
Did something I say' offend you?

287
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:54,984
What are you saying? You... you...

288
00:50:55,419 --> 00:50:56,647
Yes...?

289
00:50:57,087 --> 00:50:58,418
How do I say it?

290
00:51:00,090 --> 00:51:04,288
My dear grandpa would say'
when you want to say a lot...

291
00:51:04,528 --> 00:51:08,123
And your words aren't with you.
It's the first sign of love.

292
00:51:09,032 --> 00:51:13,469
- Your dear grandpa was right.
- Absolutely.

293
00:51:15,038 --> 00:51:17,973
But... my dear grandma used to say...

294
00:51:19,042 --> 00:51:21,977
...one can't trust men.
- Absolutely wrong.

295
00:51:23,647 --> 00:51:27,981
Had your grandma met my grandpa
she'd never harbour such thoughts.

296
00:51:29,086 --> 00:51:32,988
- Really? - Yes. My family is
renowned for love and romance.

297
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:36,025
My dear grandpa
romanced day and night.

298
00:51:36,593 --> 00:51:40,029
- Is that so. - Yes and my
family says I take after him.

299
00:51:40,497 --> 00:51:43,523
- Really?
- Yes. Believe me for you I...

300
00:51:46,503 --> 00:51:48,698
- For you I can...
- Please continue.

301
00:51:51,108 --> 00:51:52,700
- I must take leave.
- Why?

302
00:51:54,511 --> 00:51:58,447
The fact is... how can I
talk to you in front of all?

303
00:51:59,116 --> 00:52:02,313
I'll take leave and come
to see you at midnight.

304
00:52:02,586 --> 00:52:04,713
- Tonight?
- Tonight.

305
00:52:14,831 --> 00:52:16,025
Then what happened?

306
00:52:18,101 --> 00:52:19,432
Then I brought you home.

307
00:52:20,103 --> 00:52:26,042
After my family passed away'
I lived only because of you.

308
00:52:27,777 --> 00:52:29,039
I met you...

309
00:52:31,114 --> 00:52:33,048
- But I wonder what my brothers...
- Go to sleep.

310
00:52:33,517 --> 00:52:37,044
I'm going to Nandi village
for work for 2-3 days.

311
00:52:37,754 --> 00:52:42,088
You stay here and do
anything Sunita asks.

312
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:46,095
You don't worry. I'll
take good care of her.

313
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:55,764
Yes? Really? I'll be there.

314
00:52:57,174 --> 00:52:58,835
- Who was it?
- My friend' Saleem.

315
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:00,370
He's invited me for tea.

316
00:53:01,111 --> 00:53:02,442
At 4 o'clock.

317
00:53:04,114 --> 00:53:05,445
At 4 o'clock?

318
00:53:12,155 --> 00:53:13,588
She's fallen in the trap!

319
00:53:21,164 --> 00:53:23,598
Sir' you are very cruel.

320
00:53:24,568 --> 00:53:28,834
I waited for you all night
and you went to sleep at home.

321
00:53:29,506 --> 00:53:31,838
What can I say? I was
lost in thoughts of you.

322
00:53:32,175 --> 00:53:35,508
I dozed off. In the morning
when I heard you had called...

323
00:53:36,179 --> 00:53:40,115
My stupid secretary didn't wake
me up. I kicked him so much...

324
00:53:41,218 --> 00:53:42,651
My foot still hurts.

325
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:45,552
What's the matter?

326
00:53:49,226 --> 00:53:51,160
My heart is eager to meet you.

327
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:54,663
So where do we meet?

328
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:57,757
There's a mountain
close to your house.

329
00:53:58,568 --> 00:54:01,435
I can climb the Himalayas for you.

330
00:54:02,172 --> 00:54:05,107
Fine. I'll be there in half an hour.

331
00:54:09,846 --> 00:54:11,780
The lady wants to
turn me into Tensing.

332
00:54:12,182 --> 00:54:15,151
She's making a fool out of you.
No need to go there.

333
00:54:16,219 --> 00:54:17,948
- I will go!
- Why?

334
00:54:18,622 --> 00:54:22,114
- Just come with me.
- Making me climb mountains...

335
00:54:39,242 --> 00:54:42,177
Hide the bus. Hurry!
He must be on his way.

336
00:55:40,970 --> 00:55:42,232
Stop!

337
00:55:48,812 --> 00:55:51,246
- This is terrible.
- What can be done?

338
00:55:51,715 --> 00:55:53,546
Let's go back and call him.

339
00:55:59,356 --> 00:56:00,846
So' do I look like a nurse?

340
00:56:03,293 --> 00:56:06,729
If Kunwar returns now and
sees the drama in his bedroom...

341
00:56:07,297 --> 00:56:08,730
I will lose my job.

342
00:56:08,965 --> 00:56:11,229
And you'll be in jail!

343
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:20,575
- I want to talk to Kunwar.
- I was about to call you.

344
00:56:21,311 --> 00:56:23,575
He went to the mountain side
to meet you but hasn't returned.

345
00:56:24,314 --> 00:56:29,684
He hasn't reached home.
Call me soon as he comes.

346
00:56:32,021 --> 00:56:33,283
Don't worry. Everything
will turn out fine.

347
00:56:35,358 --> 00:56:36,950
Now we must move.

348
00:56:39,362 --> 00:56:40,795
We had real fun.

349
00:56:51,374 --> 00:56:53,308
- Is this okay?
- First class.

350
00:56:56,379 --> 00:56:58,142
No! What are you doing?
Don't take the call.

351
00:56:58,882 --> 00:57:02,249
Let the bell of love ring.
Now begins the real drama.

352
00:57:05,021 --> 00:57:06,283
Is everyone dead?

353
00:57:12,362 --> 00:57:16,093
- What's the point?
- Her anxiety is increasing.

354
00:57:16,366 --> 00:57:18,129
- So...? - She's wondering why
nobody is attending to the call.

355
00:57:18,535 --> 00:57:20,628
What is wrong?
Hope there's been no accident.

356
00:57:21,871 --> 00:57:24,135
Her worry increases.
She comes here to check.

357
00:57:25,041 --> 00:57:26,303
And she disconnects the phone.

358
00:57:28,378 --> 00:57:30,312
Miracle! You're a magician!

359
00:57:30,713 --> 00:57:33,307
- Then what happens?
- Then she runs to the car.

360
00:57:34,083 --> 00:57:35,311
The car screeches to the road.

361
00:57:35,919 --> 00:57:38,649
The speed increases.
The car zips here and there.

362
00:57:39,422 --> 00:57:43,324
It comes in by the dirt road
and brakes hard at our gate.

363
00:58:22,432 --> 00:58:23,694
What happened to Kunwar?

364
00:58:24,434 --> 00:58:26,368
I don't have time now
Please sit there.

365
00:58:32,108 --> 00:58:33,370
Now you may go out.

366
00:58:34,444 --> 00:58:38,380
But suppose I say you have
a fever and she comes inside...

367
00:58:38,948 --> 00:58:41,280
And touches your forehead.
It is absolutely cold.

368
00:58:42,485 --> 00:58:44,919
Good God!

369
00:58:49,492 --> 00:58:51,426
Why did you let him go up the
mountain in this terrible weather?

370
00:58:51,895 --> 00:58:54,420
- I tried to stop him but...
- And barefoot!

371
00:58:56,499 --> 00:58:59,434
Doctor' whenever I
stop him from anything...

372
00:59:00,436 --> 00:59:03,371
He says' Saleem when
death is approaching...

373
00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:06,101
Let me live my last days well.

374
00:59:06,442 --> 00:59:08,376
I will go out' sing and dance.

375
00:59:09,445 --> 00:59:10,969
And I will fall in
love before I die.

376
00:59:11,447 --> 00:59:12,846
And this is what he's doing.

377
00:59:13,049 --> 00:59:15,040
- What?
- That's right.

378
00:59:15,485 --> 00:59:17,419
He has fallen in love
with a girl called Sunita.

379
00:59:18,488 --> 00:59:23,391
He told me' he wants to see
love in her eyes before he dies.

380
00:59:27,497 --> 00:59:32,161
- And this girl...?
- She's playing with his life!

381
00:59:35,505 --> 00:59:36,836
My name is Sunita.

382
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:41,435
So you are her! Doctor'
this is the girl!

383
00:59:42,512 --> 00:59:44,946
Trust me. I had no idea
that Kunwar has cancer.

384
00:59:45,515 --> 00:59:50,452
Who can believe that of him?
Such a young man and so lively.

385
00:59:53,556 --> 00:59:55,990
I know that. It's not written
on your face that you have cancer!

386
00:59:56,292 --> 00:59:58,317
- Yet what you've done...
- I apologise for it.

387
00:59:58,962 --> 01:00:03,228
I can't tell you how sorry
I am to hear about his ailment.

388
01:00:04,567 --> 01:00:10,836
To atone for what I've done'
I'll do anything that gives him joy.

389
01:00:11,174 --> 01:00:15,508
- I don't understand.
- I'm not in love with him.

390
01:00:15,979 --> 01:00:21,007
But till his last breath' I won't
let him feel he wasn't loved.

391
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:24,553
After all how long does he have.

392
01:00:24,954 --> 01:00:26,512
Very few days.

393
01:00:27,957 --> 01:00:29,390
May I see him?

394
01:00:30,627 --> 01:00:33,061
- He's running fever.
- Only for 2 minutes.

395
01:00:52,649 --> 01:00:54,617
- How much is the fever?
- 105.

396
01:00:57,687 --> 01:00:59,120
His forehead is raging.

397
01:01:10,633 --> 01:01:12,157
I am Sunita.

398
01:01:16,639 --> 01:01:19,403
Don't leave me! I'm
abandoned in the shadows!

399
01:01:19,976 --> 01:01:22,570
I need the support.
Of your eyes' your arms...

400
01:01:25,648 --> 01:01:28,617
Don't call me Kunwar.
I am Vijay.

401
01:01:31,688 --> 01:01:34,623
Don't worry about me.

402
01:01:35,124 --> 01:01:38,616
I don't belong to anyone.
You are the man in my life.

403
01:01:39,028 --> 01:01:40,290
Will that suffice?

404
01:01:41,364 --> 01:01:42,626
The nurse is standing here.

405
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:48,637
- What's going on?
- What else? Holding each other.

406
01:01:51,708 --> 01:01:54,302
I'm wondering what
the outcome will be.

407
01:01:54,711 --> 01:01:58,647
Brother of my wife'
good beginning' happy ending.

408
01:02:02,685 --> 01:02:05,313
- Sir...
- What are you doing?

409
01:02:05,688 --> 01:02:07,622
- You should be in bed.
- Why?

410
01:02:08,024 --> 01:02:10,288
- You have fever.
- Fever...?

411
01:02:11,694 --> 01:02:13,286
Lady' please check.

412
01:02:14,697 --> 01:02:17,029
It's cold. No fever.

413
01:02:17,700 --> 01:02:22,364
My grandpa would say a patient
needs a friend' not a doctor.

414
01:02:24,707 --> 01:02:28,438
- Yes sir? - Tomorrow morning
I'll go out with Miss Sunita.

415
01:02:40,757 --> 01:02:42,088
Look in front.

416
01:02:54,771 --> 01:02:57,296
Fatso! Is this the
place to park your car?

417
01:02:57,774 --> 01:02:59,708
- Whom are you calling fat?
- The fat man.

418
01:03:00,710 --> 01:03:02,234
Do you know who I am?

419
01:03:02,712 --> 01:03:03,974
So what?

420
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:06,381
The owner of Subodh and
Subodh and Subodh Company.

421
01:03:06,716 --> 01:03:10,652
And I'm Prabodh Mukherjee of
Prabodh & Prabodh Company.

422
01:03:11,754 --> 01:03:13,688
Whoever you are'
you're both extremely fat.

423
01:03:14,157 --> 01:03:18,685
- Immediately remove the car.
- We won't. Do what you please.

424
01:03:35,444 --> 01:03:38,709
I'm stuck! Push me out.

425
01:03:40,817 --> 01:03:42,114
He's done something.

426
01:03:47,824 --> 01:03:49,553
He's removed the air!

427
01:03:51,828 --> 01:03:53,489
You wait!!!

428
01:04:14,550 --> 01:04:15,710
I'll beat you.

429
01:04:34,837 --> 01:04:37,772
- Look there...
- That rogue!

430
01:04:40,509 --> 01:04:43,774
- Take a look...
- Now I'll see where you run.

431
01:04:44,847 --> 01:04:48,180
I'll teach you a lesson
you will never ever forget!

432
01:04:48,885 --> 01:04:50,819
Leave my hand. I'll sort him out!

433
01:04:54,557 --> 01:04:55,819
Don't you dare!

434
01:04:57,293 --> 01:04:59,659
Don't you dare. I forgive you.

435
01:04:59,896 --> 01:05:01,761
Don't repeat the mistake.

436
01:05:07,837 --> 01:05:10,271
- Let's eat.
- Yes' I'm famished.

437
01:05:15,845 --> 01:05:18,780
- What's wrong?
- The secretary forgot to pack lunch.

438
01:05:19,849 --> 01:05:22,818
Now what? I'm famished.

439
01:05:27,890 --> 01:05:30,552
- Let's eat.
- Sure.

440
01:05:31,894 --> 01:05:33,828
I bet you can't get their lunch.

441
01:05:36,899 --> 01:05:39,834
- Let's eat in a hotel.
- Okay.

442
01:05:49,578 --> 01:05:50,840
The greedy hogs have gone!

443
01:06:02,892 --> 01:06:04,484
You wait here.

444
01:06:15,905 --> 01:06:19,841
Why don't we have
a bath before lunch.

445
01:06:20,910 --> 01:06:22,502
But I didn't get my trunks.

446
01:06:22,912 --> 01:06:26,507
Neither have I. Let's strip
and dash into the water.

447
01:06:26,916 --> 01:06:30,181
- Who will see us here?
- Okay.

448
01:06:56,979 --> 01:06:58,310
Start eating.

449
01:07:00,950 --> 01:07:03,384
- But they...?
- They won't come out.

450
01:07:04,286 --> 01:07:06,550
- Why?
- They are naked.

451
01:07:06,956 --> 01:07:08,287
You mean...?

452
01:07:11,961 --> 01:07:15,897
Sit down' Sunita. The servants
laid the table for us.

453
01:07:17,967 --> 01:07:19,628
Don't you dare touch the food!

454
01:07:19,969 --> 01:07:21,402
Please come here sir.

455
01:07:22,471 --> 01:07:25,907
I'll print such good pictures in
the paper that you'll be thrilled.

456
01:07:28,978 --> 01:07:31,503
Eat fast or the fat guys
might really come out.

457
01:07:39,422 --> 01:07:43,791
Fatso' the chicken is good.
Who cooked it? Your fat wife?

458
01:08:09,018 --> 01:08:10,645
Careful...

459
01:08:25,034 --> 01:08:26,968
Madam the hose pipe burst.
The car won't move ahead.

460
01:08:27,369 --> 01:08:28,961
- Then...?
- Then what?

461
01:08:30,039 --> 01:08:31,631
There's a village a furlong away.

462
01:08:33,042 --> 01:08:35,977
There's a mechanic there.
He'll fix the car.

463
01:08:37,046 --> 01:08:38,980
- How will we go there?
- Walking.

464
01:08:45,754 --> 01:08:48,018
Don't worry sweets.
I'll carry you.

465
01:08:50,493 --> 01:08:52,461
What are you doing?
I'm not so light.

466
01:09:06,375 --> 01:09:07,637
Tired?

467
01:09:09,378 --> 01:09:10,640
A little.

468
01:09:11,447 --> 01:09:14,974
Soon the car will be repaired.
We'll be home in 2 or 3 hours.

469
01:09:15,417 --> 01:09:16,748
Then go to sleep.

470
01:09:18,754 --> 01:09:20,016
Are you in a rush to go home?

471
01:09:20,589 --> 01:09:21,851
You're not?

472
01:09:24,093 --> 01:09:27,688
For me' my home is where you are.

473
01:09:45,114 --> 01:09:47,048
- The car is ready.
- Very good.

474
01:09:48,150 --> 01:09:49,879
We too are ready to leave.
Right' Sunita?

475
01:09:50,819 --> 01:09:52,047
- Absolutely ready.
- Let's go.

476
01:09:59,161 --> 01:10:02,426
- How much?
- Pay me whatever you wish.

477
01:10:04,166 --> 01:10:05,428
What's the matter?

478
01:10:08,170 --> 01:10:11,105
What's wrong? Open your eyes.

479
01:10:13,175 --> 01:10:15,439
He's unconscious.
Quickly call a doctor.

480
01:10:16,178 --> 01:10:19,113
There's no doctor here.
What is he suffering from?

481
01:10:21,217 --> 01:10:23,651
- He's got cancer.
- Cancer? - Yes.

482
01:10:23,953 --> 01:10:25,443
Doctors say he won't live long.

483
01:10:26,222 --> 01:10:30,488
Then he mustn't travel.
Don't travel in the night.

484
01:10:30,726 --> 01:10:35,163
- But... - No buts. I'll get beds
Both of you can sleep here.

485
01:10:46,742 --> 01:10:48,175
Here's a blanket for you.

486
01:10:57,286 --> 01:11:02,121
Lord! Such injustice.
Such a handsome young man.

487
01:11:02,825 --> 01:11:06,158
These are his youthful days
and you want him near you.

488
01:11:10,232 --> 01:11:12,166
What's that sound?

489
01:11:12,735 --> 01:11:15,499
There's an old temple
on the mountain across.

490
01:11:16,238 --> 01:11:19,674
It is believed anyone praying
there gets his wishes answered.

491
01:11:20,242 --> 01:11:24,679
The only condition is that you
must climb up in one go at noon.

492
01:11:25,247 --> 01:11:26,771
With no shoes on.

493
01:11:28,284 --> 01:11:31,219
- Now I'll take leave.
- All right.

494
01:11:54,643 --> 01:11:57,237
There's an old temple
on the mountain across.

495
01:11:59,315 --> 01:12:01,510
Anyone praying there
gets his wishes answered.

496
01:12:03,285 --> 01:12:05,913
The only condition is you must
climb the mountain in one go.

497
01:12:06,622 --> 01:12:07,884
With no shoes on.

498
01:13:20,362 --> 01:13:26,301
Look here... God...
I don't know how to pray.

499
01:13:29,371 --> 01:13:31,305
I've come to a temple for
the first time in my life.

500
01:13:32,374 --> 01:13:34,899
We don't follow the
system of going to temples.

501
01:13:38,781 --> 01:13:42,046
It's my fault as well as Daddy's.

502
01:13:50,426 --> 01:13:56,854
Because... man comes to God
when there's no other way.

503
01:13:58,434 --> 01:14:00,299
For the first time
I'm asking you for something.

504
01:14:01,703 --> 01:14:03,034
Vijay's life.

505
01:14:34,937 --> 01:14:37,371
I still have to climb down
and with no shoes.

506
01:14:43,779 --> 01:14:46,145
- When did you come?
- I followed you.

507
01:14:46,849 --> 01:14:49,113
You're so careless!
You should be resting.

508
01:14:49,485 --> 01:14:51,146
- You...
...are fine.

509
01:14:52,488 --> 01:14:57,391
- You don't know that I know...
- That I have cancer.

510
01:15:00,429 --> 01:15:05,093
Everything started as a joke
and you thought it was real.

511
01:15:05,434 --> 01:15:06,867
Believe me' I'm not sick.

512
01:15:07,703 --> 01:15:08,863
Swear by me.

513
01:15:10,439 --> 01:15:11,872
Yes.

514
01:15:16,445 --> 01:15:17,878
God! You heard my prayers!

515
01:15:21,984 --> 01:15:25,750
If you are fine' why did the doctor
and secretary say you have cancer?

516
01:15:26,488 --> 01:15:28,422
That's what I'm saying.
We bluffed you.

517
01:15:29,491 --> 01:15:30,822
Bluff...

518
01:15:31,493 --> 01:15:34,155
I mean you too had fooled me.

519
01:15:34,496 --> 01:15:37,431
You called me alone to the
mountainside and brought your pals.

520
01:15:40,102 --> 01:15:41,831
So this is how you took revenge.

521
01:15:42,504 --> 01:15:46,201
You feigned love to
get my sympathies.

522
01:15:47,509 --> 01:15:50,444
I did feign illness
but my love is true.

523
01:15:51,513 --> 01:15:54,846
- Romantic fool!
- What...? Everyone is romantic.

524
01:15:57,553 --> 01:16:00,886
What are you doing?
Okay. Hit me.

525
01:16:01,490 --> 01:16:02,821
Take this!

526
01:16:22,844 --> 01:16:24,778
Good God! What times!

527
01:20:59,888 --> 01:21:01,150
Feeling shy?

528
01:21:11,833 --> 01:21:13,164
- What?
- My Dad.

529
01:21:13,568 --> 01:21:16,503
Wait here' I'll talk
to him and call you in.

530
01:21:16,838 --> 01:21:18,533
- In...?
- Yes. To meet Daddy.

531
01:21:29,885 --> 01:21:33,787
I was free for 2 days.
Thought I'd see the house and you.

532
01:21:34,890 --> 01:21:37,825
And if you've had enough'
I'll take you back to Bombay.

533
01:21:38,226 --> 01:21:40,820
- I haven't had enough.
Do you know why? - Why?

534
01:21:41,229 --> 01:21:42,491
First sit down.

535
01:21:47,569 --> 01:21:50,834
- Yes?
- You're worried about my marriage.

536
01:21:53,909 --> 01:21:58,846
- Who is he? - You ask as if
I would find some nincompoop.

537
01:21:59,180 --> 01:22:02,547
- You mean... - Whatever
decision your daughter has taken...

538
01:22:02,884 --> 01:22:04,818
...it's with your position in mind.

539
01:22:05,220 --> 01:22:08,621
You'd always say' when your
groom gives you a ring...

540
01:22:09,224 --> 01:22:10,816
The engagement ring alone
would cost 10 lakhs!

541
01:22:11,893 --> 01:22:17,160
In fact he's so wealthy...

542
01:22:17,899 --> 01:22:19,833
...that he can give me ornaments
worth 50 lakhs for the engagement.

543
01:22:23,305 --> 01:22:26,832
I'm glad you considered my position.

544
01:22:27,909 --> 01:22:31,174
But you haven't understood your Dad.

545
01:22:35,250 --> 01:22:38,845
I am a wealthy father
but not one who...

546
01:22:39,287 --> 01:22:44,156
...who negotiates his child's
peace and joy in the scale of gold.

547
01:22:45,293 --> 01:22:46,624
I'll introduce you to him.

548
01:22:58,640 --> 01:23:01,507
What you are doing...
is not one bit right.

549
01:23:05,914 --> 01:23:07,848
In the flush of youth' don't forget...

550
01:23:08,950 --> 01:23:10,679
What is she and what are you.

551
01:23:12,354 --> 01:23:16,848
Before wealth slaps poverty
turn around this path.

552
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:21,895
- Promise me...
- I promise' father.

553
01:23:23,298 --> 01:23:27,234
I will never meet Sunita again.

554
01:23:33,975 --> 01:23:36,910
Tears... I hurt you.

555
01:23:38,313 --> 01:23:41,908
No' I won't interfere.
Do as you please.

556
01:23:43,018 --> 01:23:46,784
- Do as you please.
- I'll do what you want me to.

557
01:23:49,024 --> 01:23:49,718
- Tomorrow I'll return to Bombay.
- What will you do there?

558
01:23:51,426 --> 01:23:53,417
Any job' anything.

559
01:24:00,969 --> 01:24:02,630
Run! Hurry!

560
01:24:13,715 --> 01:24:17,617
Where's my bottle and glass.
And who are you?

561
01:24:24,692 --> 01:24:25,954
Beating me!!

562
01:24:35,370 --> 01:24:36,701
Get me liquor. - Okay.

563
01:24:40,041 --> 01:24:41,474
Hurry!

564
01:24:49,084 --> 01:24:50,711
Who are these new fools?

565
01:24:53,088 --> 01:24:55,852
What are you staring at?
Dumbo' tell me your name.

566
01:24:59,094 --> 01:25:01,961
- Are you dumb?
- Don't ruin my business.

567
01:25:05,033 --> 01:25:07,968
- This country liquor!
- That's what I have.

568
01:25:08,369 --> 01:25:11,304
What's that yellow drink
those fools are drinking?

569
01:25:11,706 --> 01:25:13,799
- That's whisky. We've run out.
- Run out of whisky!

570
01:25:22,083 --> 01:25:23,516
There's no whisky?

571
01:25:25,086 --> 01:25:26,519
- Give me soda.
- Okay.

572
01:25:45,106 --> 01:25:47,370
One loaf and a packet of butter.

573
01:25:48,109 --> 01:25:51,044
- Give me the key to the room
upstairs. - Key? - Yes' hurry.

574
01:26:00,755 --> 01:26:02,313
Come upstairs.
I need to talk to you.

575
01:26:04,492 --> 01:26:07,017
Leave me alone.
Leave my hand.

576
01:26:13,768 --> 01:26:15,030
Leave the girl alone.

577
01:26:16,104 --> 01:26:17,537
Jerk' drink your liquor.

578
01:27:15,163 --> 01:27:17,597
No' we haven't come to fight.

579
01:27:18,166 --> 01:27:19,428
We've come to talk to you.

580
01:27:23,838 --> 01:27:25,772
The stuff is good. Want to sell?

581
01:27:26,174 --> 01:27:28,108
You stole this necklace
in one clean swoop.

582
01:27:28,843 --> 01:27:30,435
But you got only 10000 for it.

583
01:27:31,179 --> 01:27:35,775
Had you dealt with us'
we'd have paid 12 or maybe 15.

584
01:27:36,217 --> 01:27:39,448
I've come to say'
come with me if you wish.

585
01:27:40,221 --> 01:27:44,123
I'll introduce you to a man
from whom you can earn lakhs.

586
01:27:45,226 --> 01:27:47,160
- Who is he?
- We work under him.

587
01:27:48,229 --> 01:27:50,993
- But we never ask his name.
- No' we don't want to go.

588
01:27:51,232 --> 01:27:54,668
Wait. I'll come.

589
01:27:56,237 --> 01:27:58,171
He'll go not me.

590
01:27:59,240 --> 01:28:03,609
I'd applied for a steward's job
I've come for the interview.

591
01:28:03,845 --> 01:28:05,107
Here's my card.

592
01:28:06,180 --> 01:28:07,772
You'll have to wait a little.

593
01:28:57,965 --> 01:29:00,559
I know you are very good at your work.

594
01:29:01,235 --> 01:29:02,668
That is why I've called you here.

595
01:29:03,571 --> 01:29:04,833
My address...?

596
01:29:05,239 --> 01:29:06,831
Popatlal gave it.

597
01:29:08,242 --> 01:29:10,176
Shall we discuss business?

598
01:29:10,578 --> 01:29:11,840
That's why I'm here.

599
01:29:12,580 --> 01:29:14,514
You must have heard
of the Cultural Museum.

600
01:29:15,249 --> 01:29:18,218
- There's a...
- Idol of Natraj?

601
01:29:19,287 --> 01:29:22,222
Yes' you have to bring it.

602
01:29:24,292 --> 01:29:28,558
The difficulty is not only is the
security in and out of the building...

603
01:29:30,798 --> 01:29:35,235
There are warning bells
on every way in. - I know.

604
01:29:37,305 --> 01:29:38,567
The cost of the idol?

605
01:29:42,310 --> 01:29:43,572
You tell me.

606
01:29:44,645 --> 01:29:46,078
50000.

607
01:29:46,647 --> 01:29:48,239
- 50000?
- Yes.

608
01:29:49,350 --> 01:29:53,116
25000 advance and the rest
when I bring the statue.

609
01:30:02,363 --> 01:30:04,126
You worm!

610
01:30:05,700 --> 01:30:07,964
Always remember we behead
those who try to negotiate deals.

611
01:30:08,870 --> 01:30:14,968
The head on these shoulders is
one that will be cut not bent.

612
01:31:00,421 --> 01:31:05,324
Son' in our business
talent is appreciated.

613
01:31:06,093 --> 01:31:08,687
Like a jeweler not a blacksmith.

614
01:31:11,432 --> 01:31:12,763
I accept your offer.

615
01:31:22,443 --> 01:31:24,035
Here is 25000.

616
01:31:27,448 --> 01:31:28,881
The job should be done in a month.

617
01:31:31,486 --> 01:31:34,046
And here is a foolproof
plan to steal the idol.

618
01:31:40,495 --> 01:31:41,689
Those who risk their lives
reach their destination.

619
01:31:46,501 --> 01:31:46,899
I make my own plans.

620
01:32:28,843 --> 01:32:30,777
Sir' Jack says he doesn't
want to see anyone.

621
01:32:32,513 --> 01:32:33,775
Heard that?

622
01:32:36,017 --> 01:32:40,113
Listen' for years you've been
coming regularly to see Jack.

623
01:32:40,555 --> 01:32:42,989
But he doesn't see you.
What do you want from him?

624
01:32:45,960 --> 01:32:50,488
Jack was with the man
who killed my parents.

625
01:32:51,566 --> 01:32:54,501
I want to ask Jack the name
and address of the killer.

626
01:32:54,969 --> 01:32:58,496
Will he tell you when
he didn't tell the police?

627
01:33:01,509 --> 01:33:03,773
You tell me when Jack
will be released.

628
01:33:04,512 --> 01:33:05,945
This is his last year.

629
01:33:06,514 --> 01:33:08,038
He will be free on 15 Dec.

630
01:33:09,550 --> 01:33:11,484
15th Dec.

631
01:33:28,569 --> 01:33:32,335
- You've come again today?
- Something important.

632
01:33:39,580 --> 01:33:41,275
He had come today.

633
01:33:43,618 --> 01:33:46,553
The jailerjust told me who he is.

634
01:33:46,954 --> 01:33:50,219
- Who...?
- The son of artist Gulzar.

635
01:33:50,958 --> 01:33:55,395
Don't worry. The day you are
free' we'll leave this city.

636
01:33:56,297 --> 01:34:02,327
Sure but before that I must
settle scores with Shakal.

637
01:34:04,572 --> 01:34:05,834
I've spent 15 years in prison.

638
01:34:08,576 --> 01:34:11,477
I will avenge this.

639
01:34:13,581 --> 01:34:17,017
So far the police only knows
that Shakal is a big smuggler.

640
01:34:17,618 --> 01:34:23,523
Once Jack is released they will
also know you killed Gulzar and wife.

641
01:34:24,125 --> 01:34:28,562
But don't forget Jack
and the cops don't know...

642
01:34:30,631 --> 01:34:33,327
...who Shakal is and where he lives.

643
01:34:33,634 --> 01:34:35,158
In Bombay or out.

644
01:34:35,636 --> 01:34:37,228
That's today or tomorrow.

645
01:34:37,638 --> 01:34:40,573
The police commissioner has put
a reward of 5000000 on your head.

646
01:34:41,642 --> 01:34:46,579
I would have left India
before the police get to me.

647
01:34:47,314 --> 01:34:50,579
- And the money...? - Every
penny deposited in foreign banks.

648
01:34:51,686 --> 01:34:53,119
This hotel...?

649
01:34:53,688 --> 01:34:55,383
We'll give it to our partners.

650
01:34:56,023 --> 01:34:57,581
The price of their loyalty.

651
01:34:59,360 --> 01:35:00,554
Thank you very much.

652
01:35:01,629 --> 01:35:04,564
It's not easy getting out.
There's strict police vigilance.

653
01:35:05,066 --> 01:35:08,558
It will peter off.
And we'll easily leave.

654
01:35:11,639 --> 01:35:13,903
Silver hair and beard.

655
01:35:14,375 --> 01:35:15,569
He's an old hand of our group.

656
01:35:17,645 --> 01:35:19,237
But what do I have to do?

657
01:35:19,980 --> 01:35:21,914
You want to meet your
family in London' don't you?

658
01:35:22,149 --> 01:35:23,582
- Yes.
- That's what we're arranging.

659
01:35:24,185 --> 01:35:27,586
We'll pay you for going to London.

660
01:35:28,689 --> 01:35:31,180
But you have to do one little
thing for us before leaving.

661
01:35:32,359 --> 01:35:35,123
You will have to stay in Hotel
Maryland in Shakal's name.

662
01:35:35,696 --> 01:35:38,290
And we've booked you a seat
to London in the same name.

663
01:35:38,699 --> 01:35:43,966
You'll reach London and the cops
will think Shakal is in London.

664
01:35:44,371 --> 01:35:45,633
When do I leave?

665
01:35:46,440 --> 01:35:47,634
Tonight.

666
01:35:48,709 --> 01:35:53,146
Yes' Shakal is leaving
India for good tonight.

667
01:35:53,714 --> 01:35:56,478
- How do you know?
- Call up Air India.

668
01:35:57,485 --> 01:36:01,080
A seat has been booked for him
by the midnight flight.

669
01:36:01,689 --> 01:36:04,123
- Where does he live?
- Call up Hotel Maryland.

670
01:36:05,092 --> 01:36:07,959
His room number is 303.

671
01:36:37,758 --> 01:36:41,694
If you show me the corpse'
I can tell if it is him.

672
01:36:42,763 --> 01:36:46,199
You won't recognise him as his
face is riddled with bullets.

673
01:36:47,168 --> 01:36:51,696
The police can be deceived not me.

674
01:36:58,779 --> 01:37:01,646
I had told you his
face is disfigured.

675
01:37:06,086 --> 01:37:12,286
Where is everything Shakal
had on his body when he died?

676
01:37:13,260 --> 01:37:15,694
In this cupboard.
Take a look.

677
01:37:34,782 --> 01:37:38,047
8 & 8 but Shakal wears 8 & 9.

678
01:37:38,819 --> 01:37:42,721
You are alive. You can't deceive me.

679
01:37:45,826 --> 01:37:49,262
- Sir... these shoes...
- They are Shakal's.

680
01:37:51,832 --> 01:37:53,493
Shakal is dead.

681
01:38:15,823 --> 01:38:18,758
You were very clever.
I'm pleased with you.

682
01:38:21,829 --> 01:38:23,763
Reward Mohan with 5000 bucks.

683
01:38:37,845 --> 01:38:41,611
Tell your boss I'll bring
the Natraj idol tonight.

684
01:38:42,349 --> 01:38:43,782
Let him arrange for 25000.

685
01:38:45,886 --> 01:38:47,148
25000!

686
01:38:53,894 --> 01:38:57,489
Shakal sir raised me from childhood.

687
01:38:58,299 --> 01:39:01,757
I regard him as a father figure
and you as my brother.

688
01:39:02,836 --> 01:39:04,770
I assure you all my life...

689
01:45:19,246 --> 01:45:23,182
Shocking. The guards fired
shots yet he escaped.

690
01:45:24,284 --> 01:45:27,219
I don't think he's an ordinary thief.

691
01:45:28,288 --> 01:45:30,222
I can only doubt
Shakal and his party.

692
01:45:30,691 --> 01:45:34,218
- Who is he and where does he live?
- We have our eye on some of his men.

693
01:45:34,795 --> 01:45:36,228
We are scrutinizing them.

694
01:45:38,298 --> 01:45:42,564
It's yourjob to find Shakal
and his gang in this month.

695
01:45:48,308 --> 01:45:52,074
Scoundrel! We sent you there
to keep an eye on Shankar.

696
01:45:52,312 --> 01:45:53,745
What were you doing there?

697
01:45:54,715 --> 01:45:57,912
When I came out of the museum
the guards were firing.

698
01:45:58,352 --> 01:46:00,786
- How could I save him?
- How could I save him?

699
01:46:03,290 --> 01:46:06,225
Either Shankar has been killed
or caught with the idol.

700
01:46:07,294 --> 01:46:10,559
Robert was to pay me
40000 pounds for it.

701
01:46:13,300 --> 01:46:14,892
When is Robert's plane due?

702
01:46:16,303 --> 01:46:18,897
At 5 AM tomorrow. I've
dispatched the other stuff.

703
01:46:19,306 --> 01:46:21,240
I don't want that!
I only want the idol!

704
01:46:29,649 --> 01:46:30,911
Where are you?

705
01:46:33,353 --> 01:46:34,786
We'll be there.

706
01:47:32,379 --> 01:47:33,710
Follow that car.

707
01:48:12,919 --> 01:48:14,910
I've got all your stuff.

708
01:48:15,922 --> 01:48:18,117
Here's the idol you
wanted for a whole year.

709
01:48:22,429 --> 01:48:24,363
- All the payments...
- In foreign banks.

710
01:48:28,435 --> 01:48:30,835
What about the Irani jewelry?

711
01:48:31,838 --> 01:48:34,864
It got sold in the auction.
We were a little late.

712
01:48:35,442 --> 01:48:39,037
A wealthy man from Bombay'
Devidayal bought it for 30 lakhs!

713
01:48:41,448 --> 01:48:44,417
I'm sending Roopesh to
Devidayal tomorrow.

714
01:49:16,449 --> 01:49:21,386
Actually sir' I came here with
the intention of buying these.

715
01:49:26,493 --> 01:49:30,930
I won't sell these for
any price you can offer.

716
01:49:32,499 --> 01:49:35,434
Your wish. I'll take leave.

717
01:49:36,503 --> 01:49:37,834
Good day.

718
01:49:42,509 --> 01:49:44,443
Hello Sunita. How are you?

719
01:49:54,554 --> 01:49:57,489
He came as a lover of art.
Then turned into a buyer.

720
01:49:58,558 --> 01:50:02,255
Sir' you mustn't show such
precious jewels to strangers.

721
01:50:03,563 --> 01:50:06,498
Have my tickets
to Delhi been booked?

722
01:50:06,900 --> 01:50:08,492
Yes' it's the evening flight.

723
01:50:09,569 --> 01:50:11,161
Sunita' listen...

724
01:50:13,573 --> 01:50:16,007
What is wrong with you?
You always seem lost.

725
01:50:16,576 --> 01:50:19,340
No' I was thinking of
taking you to the airport.

726
01:50:19,980 --> 01:50:22,505
I'll see Daddy off
to the airport today.

727
01:50:56,983 --> 01:50:59,349
- Listen...
- Yes' manager uncle?

728
01:51:00,186 --> 01:51:03,178
Your father told me about
how you were cheated.

729
01:51:04,290 --> 01:51:07,555
But you can't give up living.

730
01:51:09,963 --> 01:51:11,294
How long will this go on?

731
01:51:12,632 --> 01:51:16,295
You are right.
I'll try to change myself.

732
01:51:16,636 --> 01:51:19,230
- From when?
- Today.

733
01:51:43,697 --> 01:51:45,289
Do you have some work here?

734
01:51:46,700 --> 01:51:49,897
We'll eat dinner here. Call up
and tell the servants. Then join me.

735
01:52:06,686 --> 01:52:08,620
The lady at table 12...

736
01:52:13,693 --> 01:52:17,288
Don't accept payment for her
order. Tell her it's on me.

737
01:52:43,757 --> 01:52:45,088
Since when have you
become a hotel steward?

738
01:52:48,762 --> 01:52:51,026
Did you gamble away your inheritance?

739
01:52:52,098 --> 01:52:54,464
Or to some singer in a brothel?

740
01:52:57,771 --> 01:53:00,968
Which innocent girl are you
going to deceive in this rig?

741
01:53:01,708 --> 01:53:03,300
With whose life are you playing now?

742
01:53:03,710 --> 01:53:05,234
Will you order or shall I leave?

743
01:53:51,825 --> 01:53:53,156
I'm sorry...

744
01:53:56,830 --> 01:53:58,422
Leave me' you dogs!

745
01:54:18,818 --> 01:54:21,753
Go. Don't get involved with dogs.

746
01:54:24,824 --> 01:54:26,257
Whom did you call a dog?

747
01:54:30,830 --> 01:54:34,493
Tomorrow morning when your
boss sits for breakfast...

748
01:54:35,835 --> 01:54:38,497
Butter his toast with this knife.

749
01:54:57,624 --> 01:54:59,114
Wait for awhile. I'll call him.

750
01:55:17,844 --> 01:55:19,778
How can I tell you
what I felt today?

751
01:55:20,847 --> 01:55:22,109
Are you all right?

752
01:55:22,849 --> 01:55:26,444
- Are you hurt?
- No' just a little.

753
01:55:27,287 --> 01:55:29,778
I've made up my mind.
The moment my boss returns...

754
01:55:31,557 --> 01:55:32,819
I will quit this job.

755
01:55:33,893 --> 01:55:37,420
- Now I can't stay here.
- There's no need for this.

756
01:55:37,897 --> 01:55:40,161
I've got punished for what I did.

757
01:55:40,900 --> 01:55:42,834
I had forgotten my position.

758
01:55:43,569 --> 01:55:45,332
I played a joke
pretending to be Kunwar.

759
01:55:45,905 --> 01:55:49,238
And in no time the
prank turned to love.

760
01:55:51,311 --> 01:55:54,838
When Sunita spoke to her father
about the wealth I don't possess...

761
01:55:55,915 --> 01:56:01,512
I realised every relation is
a business deal for the wealthy.

762
01:56:06,893 --> 01:56:08,827
I came to tell you
I'm going to Delhi tomorrow.

763
01:56:10,897 --> 01:56:13,593
My friend' Sharma has
promised me a good job.

764
01:56:14,567 --> 01:56:18,435
That's what I wanted.
You and Sunita don't meet.

765
01:56:19,906 --> 01:56:22,841
That's what will happen.
Now I must leave.

766
01:57:27,306 --> 01:57:28,637
Now what are you thinking of?

767
01:57:30,977 --> 01:57:34,913
I don't believe it.
I want to ask you once again...

768
01:57:35,381 --> 01:57:36,905
Whether my Daddy would agree?

769
01:57:37,483 --> 01:57:39,678
How many times do I say
consider it fixed.

770
01:57:40,420 --> 01:57:42,581
- Who will convince my Dad?
- I will.

771
01:58:00,039 --> 01:58:04,635
I've come to this jail for
10 years only to meet Jack.

772
01:58:05,978 --> 01:58:08,242
You had said he would
be released on 15 Dec.

773
01:58:08,981 --> 01:58:12,644
I stayed awake all night.
Stood on guard outside the jail.

774
01:58:13,352 --> 01:58:16,287
I came in as soon as the door
opened and you say' Jack has left!

775
01:58:17,023 --> 01:58:21,926
Jack knew his enemies would
kill him the moment he stepped out.

776
01:58:23,029 --> 01:58:26,795
He had requested me to divulge
his date of release 2 days late.

777
01:58:27,033 --> 01:58:32,471
- That's what I did.
- You've done me a grave injustice.

778
01:58:36,042 --> 01:58:38,977
Can you tell me who other
than me came to see him?

779
01:58:40,046 --> 01:58:42,480
Many came but he met none.

780
01:58:43,382 --> 01:58:45,976
- Yes a girl...
- Girl?

781
01:58:46,752 --> 01:58:48,310
A girl would come here
dressed in black.

782
01:58:49,088 --> 01:58:50,350
He would always see her.

783
01:58:52,091 --> 01:58:53,524
In black...

784
01:59:08,708 --> 01:59:10,642
- What have you brought?
- Your lunch.

785
01:59:33,099 --> 01:59:34,532
Where is Jack?

786
01:59:36,102 --> 01:59:37,433
Who is he?

787
01:59:40,106 --> 01:59:41,368
Shankar' stop!

788
01:59:43,109 --> 01:59:46,806
I know your name and all about you.

789
01:59:48,114 --> 01:59:51,208
My father was present when
your parents were killed.

790
01:59:52,151 --> 01:59:54,085
Shakal killed them not he.

791
01:59:56,556 --> 01:59:59,423
Yes and his partner' Ranjit.

792
02:00:00,159 --> 02:00:04,095
Saying this doesn't absolve
your father of his crime.

793
02:00:05,164 --> 02:00:06,597
He was with them.

794
02:00:07,500 --> 02:00:10,435
And he should be
punished for his crime.

795
02:00:10,903 --> 02:00:15,863
How will you punish him?
He's spent 15 years in jail.

796
02:00:16,676 --> 02:00:18,439
His only crime was
that he was with Shakal.

797
02:00:19,178 --> 02:00:21,442
Not knowing that Shakal
was going to kill somebody.

798
02:00:22,515 --> 02:00:23,914
If the punishment for this is
death' strangle my poor father!

799
02:00:55,648 --> 02:00:58,776
No Jack. I don't want
to take revenge from you.

800
02:00:59,785 --> 02:01:01,150
I remember your favor.

801
02:01:02,622 --> 02:01:05,113
I am looking for Shakal and Ranjit!

802
02:01:08,227 --> 02:01:09,751
I'm doing this for 2 days.

803
02:01:11,230 --> 02:01:17,169
It won't be easy to find
where he is' after 15 years.

804
02:01:18,738 --> 02:01:22,674
Even the cops don't know
as much about him as I do.

805
02:01:24,243 --> 02:01:26,006
Do you know what's
special about him?

806
02:01:26,846 --> 02:01:28,177
He always wears new shoes.

807
02:01:29,248 --> 02:01:33,014
He wears number 8 shoe on his
left foot and 9 on his right.

808
02:01:34,287 --> 02:01:36,721
But how will this tell us where he is?

809
02:01:37,690 --> 02:01:41,217
Give me some time. The moment
I find out I'll inform you.

810
02:01:44,297 --> 02:01:47,733
This is my address. I can
be traced at Park Hotel too.

811
02:01:48,634 --> 02:01:49,896
I go there everyday.

812
02:01:51,304 --> 02:01:54,068
Remember I'm with you.

813
02:02:04,283 --> 02:02:06,217
- I want to ask you something.
- Yes?

814
02:02:06,686 --> 02:02:09,177
Do you ever get customers who
wear different sizes of shoes?

815
02:02:09,622 --> 02:02:11,556
- Number 8 and 9?
- No.

816
02:02:37,717 --> 02:02:38,979
I want to talk to Shakal.

817
02:02:40,353 --> 02:02:44,119
- There's nobody here of that name.
- Tell the rascal it's Jack here!

818
02:02:50,363 --> 02:02:52,797
That's check and mate.

819
02:02:57,770 --> 02:03:00,568
- Where are you' dear pal?
- These words carry no meaning now.

820
02:03:01,307 --> 02:03:05,243
The police found your fingerprints
when Gulzar and his wife were killed.

821
02:03:06,312 --> 02:03:10,248
I just have to open my mouth and
the noose will be round your neck.

822
02:03:10,716 --> 02:03:13,241
I will repay you for the obligation.

823
02:03:14,353 --> 02:03:17,618
- What do you want?
A lakh or two? - 15 lakhs.

824
02:03:18,357 --> 02:03:19,688
15 lakhs?

825
02:03:21,360 --> 02:03:23,123
When will you come for the money?

826
02:03:23,863 --> 02:03:25,797
I won't come. You
will have to send it!

827
02:03:30,369 --> 02:03:32,303
Where should I send it?

828
02:03:33,372 --> 02:03:34,100
I'll tell you tomorrow.
Wait for my call at 6 AM.

829
02:03:38,377 --> 02:03:39,810
I'll wait for it.

830
02:03:43,382 --> 02:03:44,713
15 lakhs?

831
02:03:45,751 --> 02:03:49,312
If we find out where he is'
tonight itself... - Not tonight.

832
02:03:50,756 --> 02:03:54,658
At 6 AM tomorrow'
when he calls me again.

833
02:03:59,165 --> 02:04:02,293
Put all our men on the job to find out...

834
02:04:02,868 --> 02:04:05,302
...how many telephone booths
in Bombay are near railway lines.

835
02:04:05,704 --> 02:04:06,966
For what?

836
02:04:09,375 --> 02:04:14,642
The booth Jack called from
was next to a railway line.

837
02:04:19,084 --> 02:04:20,642
I'm keeping the word I gave you.

838
02:04:21,420 --> 02:04:25,186
Your father's killer' Shakal
whom you are searching for...

839
02:04:25,424 --> 02:04:26,857
...lives in Park Hotel.

840
02:04:28,427 --> 02:04:33,364
Do meet me once before
avenging the death of your parents.

841
02:04:34,433 --> 02:04:35,866
Your friend' Jack.

842
02:05:03,095 --> 02:05:04,357
Is my money ready?

843
02:05:07,032 --> 02:05:09,193
Pray to your God one last time.

844
02:05:10,436 --> 02:05:12,700
The angel of death
is at your door.

845
02:05:39,498 --> 02:05:41,432
Father... father!

846
02:05:44,503 --> 02:05:50,442
Do meet me once before
avenging the death of your parents.

847
02:05:51,510 --> 02:05:53,273
Your friend' Jack.

848
02:05:59,552 --> 02:06:02,419
Find Shankar and bring him to me.

849
02:06:24,510 --> 02:06:26,239
The boss has called you to the hotel.

850
02:06:26,912 --> 02:06:28,846
Tell him I've given up stealing.

851
02:06:29,515 --> 02:06:30,777
It's something else.

852
02:06:31,550 --> 02:06:33,848
A letter addressed to you
has come to the hotel.

853
02:06:34,553 --> 02:06:35,884
Letter for me?

854
02:06:37,556 --> 02:06:38,818
Wait right here.

855
02:06:40,559 --> 02:06:43,494
A letter came for me at the
hotel. Must be from Jack.

856
02:06:44,563 --> 02:06:44,790
You stay with Marie.
I'll return soon.

857
02:06:59,912 --> 02:07:01,277
I've come for my letter.

858
02:07:01,847 --> 02:07:03,109
You're in quite a hurry.

859
02:07:03,515 --> 02:07:07,952
And why not? The killer you
searched for' for 15 years...

860
02:07:09,555 --> 02:07:14,288
This letter will immediately
tell you who he is and where.

861
02:07:16,562 --> 02:07:18,496
This letter is very important to you.

862
02:07:19,565 --> 02:07:21,499
And every important
thing comes at a price.

863
02:07:26,572 --> 02:07:28,506
- Deal.
- The cost?

864
02:07:28,974 --> 02:07:32,501
One small job. You must
have heard of Devidayal.

865
02:07:34,079 --> 02:07:37,014
This is a picture of
his daughter' Sunita.

866
02:07:39,618 --> 02:07:43,019
Sunita comes to this
hotel to meet an admirer.

867
02:07:43,622 --> 02:07:45,180
Their table is booked even today.

868
02:07:46,625 --> 02:07:48,559
You have to bring the girl to me.

869
02:07:49,628 --> 02:07:54,895
- Why? - I want a set of
Irani jewelry from him.

870
02:07:56,035 --> 02:07:58,401
By threatening to kill the girl?

871
02:07:59,038 --> 02:08:02,337
Only a threat. We'll
make a call to her father.

872
02:08:02,908 --> 02:08:04,500
And he'll come running
with the jewelry.

873
02:08:04,977 --> 02:08:07,172
I'm not ready to do
this despicable deed!

874
02:08:07,579 --> 02:08:09,843
The door is open.
You may leave.

875
02:08:12,017 --> 02:08:17,011
But then you will never find
the secret of your parent's killer.

876
02:08:40,646 --> 02:08:44,082
- Why did you let him leave?
- So he can bring Sunita.

877
02:08:44,683 --> 02:08:46,116
After that...?

878
02:08:47,686 --> 02:08:50,120
After that...

879
02:08:53,692 --> 02:08:56,456
Tell all your men to
keep an eye on Shankar.

880
02:08:57,696 --> 02:09:00,221
This will be the last
night of his life!

881
02:09:14,646 --> 02:09:18,582
But then you'll never find the
secret of your parent's killer.

882
02:09:36,702 --> 02:09:38,636
Welcome. Take a seat.

883
02:09:40,205 --> 02:09:42,139
- Where is he?
- Who?

884
02:09:43,709 --> 02:09:45,370
He said he works for the hotel.

885
02:09:45,711 --> 02:09:47,645
And the one I'm supposed to
meet has called me upstairs.

886
02:09:48,380 --> 02:09:49,642
He will soon be here.

887
02:09:50,716 --> 02:09:52,149
I don't want to sit here.

888
02:10:00,425 --> 02:10:01,687
I've been cheated and brought here.

889
02:10:02,761 --> 02:10:04,092
Possibly.

890
02:10:05,764 --> 02:10:07,197
What do you want from me?

891
02:10:09,768 --> 02:10:13,704
If you don't want us to
use force' sit down.

892
02:10:28,821 --> 02:10:32,723
Who is this? Manager?
I want to talk to Devidayal.

893
02:10:35,828 --> 02:10:38,160
Okay' doesn't matter.
I'll call later.

894
02:10:42,501 --> 02:10:45,766
He's gone to Delhi and will
return by the 10 PM flight.

895
02:10:48,240 --> 02:10:53,268
Madam' you are our guest
till your father returns.

896
02:10:58,884 --> 02:11:00,044
- Let go!
- Bring her here.

897
02:11:02,821 --> 02:11:04,755
Lock her in the room. Fast!

898
02:11:09,828 --> 02:11:11,261
Yourjob has been done.

899
02:11:12,831 --> 02:11:14,264
Give me the letter.

900
02:11:16,835 --> 02:11:18,769
The job is not done.

901
02:11:20,339 --> 02:11:23,274
You have to bring the
jewelry from Devidayal.

902
02:11:23,842 --> 02:11:25,776
And take his daughter back.

903
02:11:26,845 --> 02:11:28,278
Only then...

904
02:11:30,349 --> 02:11:32,783
Then your dream will be fulfilled.

905
02:11:34,386 --> 02:11:37,787
I don't know your name
but I do know this much...

906
02:11:38,557 --> 02:11:40,491
There is honesty among thieves.

907
02:11:41,293 --> 02:11:42,419
Honour among thieves.

908
02:11:43,395 --> 02:11:45,829
You never mentioned bringing
the jewelry for the letter.

909
02:11:47,232 --> 02:11:49,257
My job was to bring Sunita to you...

910
02:12:17,896 --> 02:12:19,227
What's wrong with you?

911
02:12:27,239 --> 02:12:29,503
What is it?

912
02:12:34,913 --> 02:12:36,175
I sometimes get fits.

913
02:12:36,915 --> 02:12:40,851
There's still time for
Devidayal to return.

914
02:12:41,954 --> 02:12:43,216
Sit in the dining hall.

915
02:12:43,956 --> 02:12:46,550
We'll call you when you are needed.

916
02:13:01,640 --> 02:13:03,437
Do you think he had a fit?

917
02:13:03,642 --> 02:13:06,338
He was acting so he wouldn't
have to go to bring the jewelry.

918
02:13:07,913 --> 02:13:09,847
He was neither acting
nor did he suffer a fit.

919
02:13:11,950 --> 02:13:13,884
I suspect something else.

920
02:13:18,557 --> 02:13:21,390
The guards are warned not to
let Shankar out of the hotel.

921
02:13:53,692 --> 02:13:55,284
No' Sunita hasn't come as yet.

922
02:13:55,527 --> 02:13:58,553
Please be seated in the hall.
I'll tell her that you've come.

923
02:14:07,973 --> 02:14:09,406
Nothing.

924
02:14:56,822 --> 02:14:59,689
One prey and lots of hunters.

925
02:15:01,760 --> 02:15:04,752
From up to downstairs.
From here to the roads.

926
02:15:05,363 --> 02:15:06,625
About 40 revolvers.

927
02:15:08,533 --> 02:15:10,467
And the target is just one head.

928
02:15:11,803 --> 02:15:13,964
And the reward... 25000.

929
02:15:28,587 --> 02:15:34,856
Before I begin today's program'
I'll sing you a 15 year old song.

930
02:15:35,594 --> 02:15:41,362
With the prayer that it reaches
the ears that once sang it with me.

931
02:15:42,100 --> 02:15:43,499
My own brothers.

932
02:19:33,298 --> 02:19:39,726
Dear Vijay and Ratan' I'll wait
for you at midnight at LIC building

933
02:19:40,305 --> 02:19:42,569
Your elder brother' Shankar.

934
02:19:50,315 --> 02:19:53,079
The boy who sings in this hotel...

935
02:19:56,087 --> 02:19:59,284
- His real name is Ratan.
- Give him this letter.

936
02:21:01,419 --> 02:21:05,321
Finally the day I was
waiting for has dawned!

937
02:21:07,225 --> 02:21:09,352
I will leave India forever.

938
02:21:11,429 --> 02:21:12,862
Should I call Devidayal?

939
02:21:13,932 --> 02:21:15,365
Not yet. In a while.

940
02:22:18,496 --> 02:22:20,430
Open the door.
What are you doing?

941
02:22:26,504 --> 02:22:27,937
Proceed.

942
02:22:49,561 --> 02:22:51,756
- Hurry... - You?
- Believe me I'm here to free you.

943
02:22:52,230 --> 02:22:53,492
Hurry. Please.

944
02:23:34,572 --> 02:23:37,837
I know you have found out who I am.

945
02:23:38,977 --> 02:23:41,002
That is why you freed Sunita.

946
02:23:41,579 --> 02:23:45,345
But my friend when
Shakal plays cards...

947
02:23:46,618 --> 02:23:50,520
He has cards in his hand
and some up his sleeve.

948
02:23:53,625 --> 02:23:56,355
You letter to your brothers...

949
02:23:58,630 --> 02:24:02,498
In return for Sunita' the lives
of your brothers is in my hands.

950
02:24:05,570 --> 02:24:13,341
The price of their lives is
the Irani jewelry Devidayal has.

951
02:24:14,312 --> 02:24:17,008
You know very well that
I can't bring the jewelry.

952
02:24:18,583 --> 02:24:23,384
- Sunita might agree but her Dad...
- Yourjob is to convince him.

953
02:24:24,622 --> 02:24:29,025
- I'm leaving India for good...
- From the secret airport?

954
02:24:30,628 --> 02:24:32,152
So you know that too?

955
02:24:33,631 --> 02:24:37,397
You have to bring the
jewelry to my secret airport.

956
02:24:38,636 --> 02:24:43,573
Useless involving the police
because if it comes to bloodshed...

957
02:24:44,042 --> 02:24:46,567
You will get my dead body but...

958
02:24:47,645 --> 02:24:52,241
The bodies of your young brothers
too will be suffering in the sand!

959
02:25:31,689 --> 02:25:33,247
- Ready to leave?
- Absolutely.

960
02:25:51,709 --> 02:25:53,472
You wanted the Irani jewelry.

961
02:26:09,694 --> 02:26:11,423
Here are your ornaments.

962
02:26:12,697 --> 02:26:14,358
Ask where Shankar is.

963
02:26:14,699 --> 02:26:16,963
Where is Shankar?

964
02:26:17,702 --> 02:26:23,140
He's with Daddy. If his brothers
don't return he'll kill Daddy.

965
02:26:25,710 --> 02:26:27,644
Release Vijay and Ratan.

966
02:26:28,212 --> 02:26:30,646
Along with them' your man
can come and take the jewelry.

967
02:26:31,716 --> 02:26:34,685
There's no reason to be scared.
I've come alone.

968
02:27:20,765 --> 02:27:25,202
Before we give in to you'
I want to see the bag.

969
02:28:14,819 --> 02:28:19,085
If you want your son's life'
leave my brothers.

970
02:28:21,492 --> 02:28:24,757
Your son will walk from here
as my brothers start from there.

971
02:28:30,835 --> 02:28:32,268
Bring them here.

972
02:28:36,841 --> 02:28:38,775
Uncuff them. Let them go.

973
02:28:56,294 --> 02:29:00,162
Once my son is safe'
I'll kill all of you!

974
02:29:02,333 --> 02:29:04,767
Once my brothers are safe...

975
02:29:06,237 --> 02:29:08,171
Either Shakal will live or me.

976
02:29:09,440 --> 02:29:11,772
Destiny will decide life and death.

977
02:31:49,100 --> 02:31:51,534
Brother! I will take
care here. Help me God!

978
02:33:40,177 --> 02:33:44,113
Why did you stop? Lift the
dagger and stab me in the chest!

979
02:33:45,182 --> 02:33:51,121
No. I won't dirty my hands
with your impure blood!

980
02:33:52,223 --> 02:33:57,661
Your death is approaching.
Take a look! You dog!

981
02:34:01,832 --> 02:34:07,395
The law will punish me for
the crimes I did to reach you.

982
02:34:08,172 --> 02:34:13,940
But I'm glad that God is with
me in taking revenge from you.

983
02:34:20,618 --> 02:34:24,782
No' I won't simplify
your problem so soon.

984
02:34:26,223 --> 02:34:29,818
Recall the night when the
revolver was in your hand...

985
02:34:30,828 --> 02:34:32,819
And my helpless father
stood before you.

986
02:34:33,631 --> 02:34:36,156
The scene of a fathers' death
that these eyes witnessed...

987
02:34:37,234 --> 02:34:40,499
Today your son will
witness the same scene!
