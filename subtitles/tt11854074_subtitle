The time at which your mother has

"Your love is my destination..."

00:13:45,212 --> 00:13:48,203
"Let me come with you like a shadow..."

191
00:13:51,367 --> 00:13:53,786
"You are my heartbeat..."

192
00:13:57,410 --> 00:14:00,660
"You are the inundation of my thoughts"

we've been chatting on Facebook and
spend our time at coffee shops...

Bro, did it work out or not?

198

-I'll kill you
-Oh! It didn't happen?

00:14:44,535 --> 00:14:45,827
-You... Rascal!
-Oh! It means it didn't work out.

-Okay... Okay... Okay...
-You...

201
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:49,473
Better luck next time.
Okay... Okay... Okay...

Bye, Swati.

206
00:15:03,869 --> 00:15:06,036
By the way,
your love story is simply superb!

207
00:15:06,119 --> 00:15:08,161
Turn this side. What's super? It is dumb!

208
00:15:08,244 --> 00:15:09,911
-Nothing happened there.
-You...

209
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:12,292
What should happen?

210
00:15:12,425 --> 00:15:13,497
-Please go.
-Nothing.

211
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:16,583
-I'll slap you...
-I'll tell her.

-Hi Sweety...
-Krishna...

Krishna...

215
00:15:27,619 --> 00:15:28,827
What exactly happened?

216
00:15:28,994 --> 00:15:30,744
My mom has fixed my
wedding with my cousin.

217
00:15:30,952 --> 00:15:32,952
Did you pack everything properly?
Oh Krishnaveni! Come... Come...

218
00:15:33,036 --> 00:15:34,577
-Get those chairs.
-Okay, sir.

219
00:15:37,068 --> 00:15:38,001
-Coffee?
-No.

00:15:38,034 --> 00:15:39,111
-You want coconut water?
-No

221
00:15:39,136 --> 00:15:40,329
Go and get one.

222
00:15:40,786 --> 00:15:42,827
Cousin, I don't want to
get into this wedding.

223
00:15:43,328 --> 00:15:44,786
We've grown up together.

224
00:15:44,952 --> 00:15:46,410
I never had such feelings on you.

225
00:15:46,501 --> 00:15:48,271
-Did you love someone?
-Nothing like that.

226
00:15:48,296 --> 00:15:49,795
If so, I would've told you.

227
00:15:49,827 --> 00:15:51,494
Don't tell your mother
that you have talked to me.

228
00:15:51,786 --> 00:15:53,452
-I'll take care of everything.
-How?

229
00:15:53,681 --> 00:15:55,518
I'll tell them that I don't want
to get into this wedding.

230
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:59,660
Well... We had discussions
and fixed this marriage.

231
00:15:59,994 --> 00:16:01,535
But actually,
Krishna is very much fond of me.

232
00:16:01,827 --> 00:16:03,200
I got to know about it yesterday.

233
00:16:03,286 --> 00:16:05,369
She came to the factory to see me.

234
00:16:05,509 --> 00:16:06,801
She said she likes me.

235
00:16:07,077 --> 00:16:08,535
I'm so happy, Aunt.

236
00:16:12,744 --> 00:16:17,786
If he expressed his feelings
towards me on that day,

237
00:16:18,452 --> 00:16:19,827
I might have got convinced.

238
00:16:19,952 --> 00:16:23,535
But that rogue made me wait till the
last minute and left me with no option.

239
00:16:23,827 --> 00:16:27,535
Fine! Should I tell you the twist
that you don't know in this story?

240
00:16:28,763 --> 00:16:30,738
There is someone called
Bujjigadu in your town.

241
00:16:30,763 --> 00:16:32,897
Everyone is thinking that
you have eloped with him.

242
00:16:33,036 --> 00:16:33,632
What?

243
00:16:33,845 --> 00:16:35,786
He slipped away at the
same time as you did.

244
00:16:35,986 --> 00:16:38,077
Both your phones are
switched off at the same time.

245
00:16:39,369 --> 00:16:41,994
Scoundrel! Didn't he find
any other time to slip away!

246
00:16:42,619 --> 00:16:45,410
I can't go back now and tell
them that I don't know him.

247
00:16:45,886 --> 00:16:49,094
Every moronic guy in this
world is disturbing my privacy.

248
00:16:49,469 --> 00:16:50,886
It was my cousin over there
and here, it is this guy!

249
00:16:50,969 --> 00:16:52,219
-What's his name?
-Bujji.

250
00:16:53,236 --> 00:16:54,652

OREY BUJJIGA...
(HEY BUJJI...)

252
00:17:02,547 --> 00:17:03,714
Hey Bujji...

253
00:17:05,523 --> 00:17:07,065
It's been so long that I have seen you!

254
00:17:07,131 --> 00:17:08,964
When did you come and what did
you get for me from your town?

255
00:17:09,714 --> 00:17:12,047
I got four pairs of
clothing. Go and wash them.

256
00:17:12,131 --> 00:17:13,214
Did you bring four pairs of clothing?

257
00:17:13,239 --> 00:17:15,959
I escaped from home for a girl
and you are asking me silly questions.

258
00:17:15,984 --> 00:17:18,307
Your love story is very interesting.
Tell me more about it, Mr Bujji.

259
00:17:18,332 --> 00:17:19,998
Hey... Love story?

260
00:17:20,072 --> 00:17:21,447
Who is the girl?

261
00:17:24,893 --> 00:17:25,973
Mr Bujji...

262
00:17:25,998 --> 00:17:27,022
Yes.

263
00:17:27,047 --> 00:17:29,131
We are done with the song.
Narrate the rest of the story.

264
00:17:29,781 --> 00:17:30,870
No, you must listen to the song.

265
00:17:30,895 --> 00:17:32,788
Finish the rest of the story and then we
shall again listen it from the beginning.

266
00:17:33,442 --> 00:17:34,545
Attaboy!

267
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:35,945
I like your excitement.

268
00:17:36,231 --> 00:17:37,356
Let's come to the climax.

269
00:17:37,989 --> 00:17:39,897
-She's in trying to go to the USA.
-Oh!

270
00:17:40,173 --> 00:17:41,214
Before she gets her visa,

271
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:42,797
I shall got to her
college and propose her.

272
00:17:42,881 --> 00:17:45,173
-Super brother!
-All the best, sir. All the best.

273
00:18:00,256 --> 00:18:02,106
You are Swati, who I met in S3 coach
of Visakha Express train, right?

274
00:18:02,214 --> 00:18:03,756
Hi, how come you are here?

275
00:18:04,064 --> 00:18:05,441
I'm asking you the same question.

276
00:18:05,964 --> 00:18:07,672
-I have an appointment with the chairman.
-Why?

277
00:18:07,756 --> 00:18:08,881
Work-related.

278
00:18:08,964 --> 00:18:11,231
-What is that work?
-I have an app idea.

279
00:18:11,409 --> 00:18:13,134
-I need an investor
-Tell me the concept.

280
00:18:14,714 --> 00:18:17,006
Hello... Why don't you
respond the first time?

281
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:19,422
It'll be a practice for you too. Tell me.

282
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:22,882
Okay. So about 60 to 80
percent of the population...

283
00:18:22,926 --> 00:18:25,480
are not able to look at their phones
because of their eyesight.

284
00:18:25,505 --> 00:18:27,214
But if they download our app,

285
00:18:27,339 --> 00:18:31,551
they can set it as per their eye-vision
such as nearsighted and farsighted...

286
00:18:31,649 --> 00:18:33,122
and see their phones
without their glasses on.

287
00:18:33,222 --> 00:18:34,214
What if I take your phone?

288
00:18:34,398 --> 00:18:36,106
So there are these four steps.

289
00:18:36,131 --> 00:18:37,939
We can use them and change the settings.

290
00:18:37,964 --> 00:18:40,308
But they should do these four steps
with their glasses on, right?

291
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:41,653
-Yeah!
-Or they should take help.

292
00:18:41,678 --> 00:18:43,016
What if we use a technology that

293
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:46,362
changes the settings automatically as per
my eye-vision upon taking your phone?

294
00:18:46,387 --> 00:18:47,246
How is that possible?

295
00:18:47,339 --> 00:18:50,098
Iris recognition
technology... like an iPhone-X lock.

296
00:18:50,872 --> 00:18:52,147
If we apply that on our app,

297
00:18:52,247 --> 00:18:54,002
Our app will become
mandatory for every phone.

298
00:18:54,102 --> 00:18:55,292
That will become the USP for our app.

299
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:57,231
Madam, the MD wants to see you.

300
00:18:58,089 --> 00:18:59,339
Keep your idea to yourself.

301
00:18:59,689 --> 00:19:01,189
Don't confuse me in the last minute.

302
00:19:01,439 --> 00:19:02,386

303
00:19:02,591 --> 00:19:03,615

-Come in.
-Yeah.

306
00:19:10,402 --> 00:19:13,485

-Sir, but...
-Okay!

309
00:19:17,068 --> 00:19:18,068
I am farsighted.

310
00:19:18,152 --> 00:19:20,736
I'll adjust that in my
phone settings and read it.

311
00:19:20,861 --> 00:19:22,652
Suppose you are nearsighted.

312
00:19:22,819 --> 00:19:24,694
How will you read the content on my phone?

313
00:19:24,777 --> 00:19:26,943
Sir, we use those four steps.

314
00:19:27,068 --> 00:19:29,402
Four steps... Four steps...
I don't think the UI is friendly.

315
00:19:29,736 --> 00:19:30,906
But you have a lot of potential.

316
00:19:30,956 --> 00:19:32,763
Come back to me with another idea. Okay?

prototype for this app as well.

-I've used your idea.
-Did they throw you out?

326
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,060
No. It was a super success!

327
00:19:56,477 --> 00:19:58,310
They asked me to come again with
the detailed project after two weeks.

328
00:19:58,394 --> 00:20:00,444
-All the credit goes to you.
-Where is the treat?

329
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:03,644
You just heard it once
and gave me a superb idea.

330
00:20:03,893 --> 00:20:05,435
Will you associate with me?

331
00:20:06,651 --> 00:20:09,317
This app will have a nice future.
Think about it once, please.

332
00:20:09,477 --> 00:20:10,977
It's okay. No problem Shall we start?

333

Mr Srinu, you're a workaholic.

334

I would start my love story.

335

listening to your story.

Good morning, madam.

347
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,477
Mr Koteshwar Rao, madam is calling you.

348
00:21:32,394 --> 00:21:33,644
Greetings, madam.

349
00:21:34,727 --> 00:21:37,927
What Koti... eshwar Rao?

350
00:21:38,977 --> 00:21:40,185
What's the matter?

351
00:21:40,519 --> 00:21:42,602
I've handled the construction work of
a bridge on the East side canal, madam.

352
00:21:42,977 --> 00:21:45,018
I was told they have released
the amount in a cheque.

353
00:21:45,644 --> 00:21:46,935
So, I came here to collect it.

354
00:21:47,644 --> 00:21:49,143
-Sit down.
-Thank you, madam.

355
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,769
Rangaswamy...

356
00:21:54,602 --> 00:21:55,686
Did we receive his cheque?

357
00:21:55,852 --> 00:21:57,644
Yes, madam.
We received it ten days ago.

358
00:21:57,727 --> 00:21:58,868
What is the amount?

359
00:21:58,893 --> 00:21:59,893
One crore rupees, madam.

360
00:22:00,727 --> 00:22:02,102
Why didn't you hand it
over to him till now?

361
00:22:02,185 --> 00:22:03,811
You did not sign the cheque, madam.

362
00:22:04,227 --> 00:22:06,602
-You were busy with the wedding works.
-Oh...

363
00:22:07,227 --> 00:22:08,560
Wedding works...

364
00:22:10,394 --> 00:22:11,848
Madam

365
00:22:17,602 --> 00:22:19,102
Did we check the project?

366
00:22:19,127 --> 00:22:20,202
Yes, madam.

367
00:22:20,227 --> 00:22:22,352
Why am I not able to recollect it?

368
00:22:23,727 --> 00:22:26,560
Maybe I forgot because of wedding works.

369
00:22:26,935 --> 00:22:28,102
Let's do something.

370
00:22:28,811 --> 00:22:30,727
Let's do the quality check again.

371
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:34,769
Mr Koteshwar Rao...

372
00:22:35,644 --> 00:22:39,102
We shall make it go through all kinds
of quality check again, make a report

373
00:22:39,269 --> 00:22:41,769
and send the file again.
What do you think?

374
00:22:41,893 --> 00:22:45,060
I'll think that you've been stalling my
cheque on the behalf of personal reasons.

375
00:22:45,352 --> 00:22:46,195
Yes.

376
00:22:46,421 --> 00:22:47,659
Yes, of course.

377
00:22:47,893 --> 00:22:49,018
I will not leave this.

378
00:22:49,227 --> 00:22:51,102
I will complain this to
the higher officials.

379
00:22:51,394 --> 00:22:53,018
Complain to whoever the hell you want!

380
00:22:53,727 --> 00:22:55,935
I'll even cite that the ink
in my pen has been finished.

381
00:22:56,560 --> 00:23:01,394
You will get this cheque only
when my daughter comes home.

382
00:23:01,727 --> 00:23:02,852
Until then... Hmph!

383
00:23:04,686 --> 00:23:07,018
I will go to court.
I will sit in front of the media.

384
00:23:07,102 --> 00:23:08,477
I will make this a big issue.

385
00:23:08,769 --> 00:23:10,360
I will drag you on to the roads.

386
00:23:10,527 --> 00:23:13,060
[scoffs] Pollution department,

387
00:23:13,185 --> 00:23:14,269
forest department,

388
00:23:14,352 --> 00:23:15,686
eletricity department etc.

389
00:23:15,852 --> 00:23:18,869
I want a NOC from all of them.

390
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:20,102
Rangaswamy,

391
00:23:20,352 --> 00:23:24,060
all the departments should
meet me and submit NOC to me.

392
00:23:24,602 --> 00:23:28,118
Until then, throw this file aside

393
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:32,548
[phone ringing]

394
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:34,029
Hello...

395
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:34,982
How are you, mom?

396
00:23:35,777 --> 00:23:36,805
How is father doing?

397
00:23:36,905 --> 00:23:38,227
Have you got any sense?
Why have you done it in this manner?

398
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:40,977
-Well, mom... my situation...
-What situation?

399
00:23:41,143 --> 00:23:42,769
Do you know how many
problems we are facing?

400
00:23:42,935 --> 00:23:43,902
We incurred a loss
of one crore rupees.

401
00:23:44,133 --> 00:23:44,883
Really?

402
00:23:45,263 --> 00:23:46,204
We incurred a loss of one crore rupees

403
00:23:46,304 --> 00:23:47,327
when I didn't turn up for the
matchmaking that he fixed?

404
00:23:47,352 --> 00:23:48,769
Who is giving me so much dowry?

405
00:23:48,893 --> 00:23:49,977
Shut up, idiot!

406
00:23:50,143 --> 00:23:52,727
Whatever happened has
happened. Take good care of the girl.

407
00:23:53,587 --> 00:23:54,746
Well, be careful with the gold ornaments.

408
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:55,476
What gold ornaments?

409
00:23:55,576 --> 00:23:57,935
Krishnaveni brought so many
gold ornaments with her.

410
00:23:58,018 --> 00:23:59,060
Who is Krishnaveni?

411
00:23:59,185 --> 00:24:01,102
Daughter of Veeramachineni Chamundeshwari.

412
00:24:01,269 --> 00:24:03,727
Who is this Veeramachineni?
Who is this Chamundeshwari?

413
00:24:03,893 --> 00:24:05,519
Why are you joking?

414
00:24:05,544 --> 00:24:07,993
<i>You've eloped with Krishnaveni,
daughter of Chamundeshwari, haven't you?</i>

415
00:24:08,018 --> 00:24:09,852
-Who told you this?
-It was you who has told me that.

416
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:10,827
Me?

417
00:24:10,852 --> 00:24:13,102
You said that you were going
to the girl who you loved.

418
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:13,997
Yeah.

419
00:24:14,221 --> 00:24:17,282
Krishnaveni's too slipped away
from her home at the same. So...

420
00:24:17,482 --> 00:24:18,328
So...

421
00:24:18,524 --> 00:24:21,394
So, I thought that she came with
you and told the same to everyone.

422
00:24:22,811 --> 00:24:23,893
Are you insane?

423
00:24:24,102 --> 00:24:25,560
How can you say that, mom?

424
00:24:26,769 --> 00:24:28,644
You've written the review of a
movie by watching the trailer.

425
00:24:28,769 --> 00:24:30,477
Oh no! It is my fault!

426
00:24:30,686 --> 00:24:31,935
I blame myself for
everything that has happened.

427
00:24:32,143 --> 00:24:34,560
Wait, I'll go and inform
everything to your father.

428
00:24:34,644 --> 00:24:35,727
Stop it!

429
00:24:36,143 --> 00:24:38,686
Retraction of a gossip won't change
people's mind after it becomes viral.

430
00:24:39,143 --> 00:24:40,285
First, tell me about the situation there.

431
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:42,102
Since Chamundeshwari believes that
you've eloped with her daughter,

432
00:24:42,269 --> 00:24:45,935
she has put your father's cheque
of one crore rupees on hold.

433
00:24:46,102 --> 00:24:48,310
<i>She added our company's
name in the black list.</i>

434
00:24:48,394 --> 00:24:51,018
I don't understand
what should we do now.

435
00:24:51,143 --> 00:24:52,644
First, stop crying!

436
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:54,519
I don't know who is Veeramachineni or

437
00:24:54,686 --> 00:24:57,428
Chamundeshwari or Krishnaveni.

438
00:24:57,977 --> 00:25:00,244
But if I get her to our town
and hand her to her family,

439
00:25:00,469 --> 00:25:02,219
father's problem would be
solved. All I know is this.

440
00:25:02,319 --> 00:25:03,153
I'll be on that.

441
00:25:03,334 --> 00:25:04,545
Please do that, son.

442
00:25:05,394 --> 00:25:07,435
If you want any money,
take it from aunt Beba.

443
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:08,477
I'll call and inform her.

444
00:25:08,602 --> 00:25:10,227
I know what to do. Hang up!

445
00:25:14,893 --> 00:25:15,910
Name of the girl?

446
00:25:15,935 --> 00:25:16,977
Krishnaveni

447
00:25:18,143 --> 00:25:19,650
-Last name?
-Veeramachineni

448
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:21,352
Whoa! What a rhyming!

449
00:25:23,018 --> 00:25:24,893
Oh... Lots of profiles, bro.

450
00:25:28,185 --> 00:25:29,935
There is only one school in our town.

451
00:25:30,143 --> 00:25:31,811
Everyone has to study until
seventh grade in that school.

452
00:25:31,935 --> 00:25:33,185
You are right!

453
00:25:33,394 --> 00:25:34,560
Chances are bright!

454
00:25:34,769 --> 00:25:37,301
-Hold it, dude.
-Oh, sorry! What's the name of the school?

455
00:25:37,435 --> 00:25:38,935
Vignana Jyothi Memorial High School.

456
00:25:40,601 --> 00:25:42,000
Hey...

457
00:25:42,644 --> 00:25:45,018
What is that she has put up
a flower as her profile picture?

458
00:25:45,394 --> 00:25:46,477
That's the nature of the girls.

459
00:25:46,686 --> 00:25:48,977
They keep flowers and birds
as their profile pictures.

460
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:50,935
See if there are any other pictures.

461
00:25:53,185 --> 00:25:54,202
No access.

462
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:56,102
I think she is astute!

463
00:25:56,435 --> 00:25:58,269
Mr Bujji, what should we do now?

464
00:26:00,317 --> 00:26:04,268
What if we... create a fake female
profile and send her friend request?

465
00:26:04,935 --> 00:26:06,227
Good idea! Let's do it.

466
00:26:06,686 --> 00:26:07,977
What name shall we use?

467
00:26:09,061 --> 00:26:09,827
ANDHRA JYOTHI

468
00:26:10,127 --> 00:26:10,643
Jyothi.

469
00:26:10,725 --> 00:26:12,012
Request sent.

470
00:26:12,927 --> 00:26:14,511
-Let's go!
-Wait, Mr Bujji.

471
00:26:14,686 --> 00:26:16,018
Let's wait for her reply.

472
00:26:16,227 --> 00:26:17,644
Girls are very astute!

473
00:26:17,935 --> 00:26:19,352
Upon sending a friend request,
they would immediately see it.

474
00:26:19,477 --> 00:26:20,977
But they'd take two
days to accept the request.

475
00:26:21,043 --> 00:26:22,458
Let's check it tomorrow. Close it.

476
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,702
Sorry, baby.

477
00:26:24,727 --> 00:26:28,077
Ignoring your call is like...
I just can't...

478
00:26:28,102 --> 00:26:30,769
You look so cute when
you request me innocently.

479
00:26:30,977 --> 00:26:33,060
You don't get even a
bit angry at me, do you?

480
00:26:33,185 --> 00:26:35,185
-Let's talk something interesting
-Yeah

481
00:26:35,352 --> 00:26:37,644
Actually, why I came
to Hyderabad is that...

482
00:26:37,769 --> 00:26:38,861
Huh! One second.

483
00:26:38,961 --> 00:26:41,717
The food which you've ordered last
night through Swiggy was very delicious!

484
00:26:42,156 --> 00:26:44,151
That's not a big deal.
I'll send you one more tomorrow.

485
00:26:44,351 --> 00:26:45,310
It'll be amazing!

486
00:26:45,519 --> 00:26:46,727
Hi, Mr Srinu...

487
00:26:48,031 --> 00:26:49,086
She is Swathi.

488
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:50,644
-And she is...
-Srujana.

489
00:26:50,977 --> 00:26:52,394
How do you know my name?

490
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,394
Mr Srinu keeps talking
about you all the time.

491
00:26:55,602 --> 00:26:57,811
-What did he say?
-Please don't tell her anything.

492
00:26:58,018 --> 00:26:59,352
No, this is the right time. Tell her.

493
00:26:59,377 --> 00:27:01,327
This is not the right time.
I'll express my love to her later.

494
00:27:01,352 --> 00:27:03,202
-Hello.
-You mustn't delay such things. Tell her.

495
00:27:03,227 --> 00:27:05,227
Hello... May I know what's happening here?

496
00:27:05,269 --> 00:27:06,477
Nothing, baby.

497
00:27:06,544 --> 00:27:07,811
-What will you have?
-Ice cream.

498
00:27:07,935 --> 00:27:09,018
-Vanilla ice cream?
-Yeah.

499
00:27:09,102 --> 00:27:10,977
With almonds, tutti frutti,
chocolate syrup?

500
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:12,477
You know me, right baby?

501
00:27:12,977 --> 00:27:14,310
-What about you?
-Dark chocolate.

502
00:27:14,519 --> 00:27:16,435
Hello bearer, take the order.

503
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:20,886
[sighs]

504
00:27:22,686 --> 00:27:24,008
I'll go and get it.

505
00:27:26,727 --> 00:27:27,935
I think he's in love with you.

506
00:27:28,102 --> 00:27:29,439
-Really?
-Hmm.

507
00:27:29,852 --> 00:27:31,310
And your pair looks beautiful.

508
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:32,977
Oh no! There's nothing like that.

509
00:27:33,435 --> 00:27:35,352
I've applied for a visa to go to the US.

510
00:27:35,686 --> 00:27:37,519
Once I get it,

511
00:27:37,644 --> 00:27:39,018
I'll be there, and he'll be here.

512
00:27:39,269 --> 00:27:40,543
And that doesn't work out.

513
00:27:41,935 --> 00:27:43,118
What if you don't get a visa?

514
00:27:43,143 --> 00:27:44,977
It is not an issue if I don't
get it Rajesh has a Green Card.

515
00:27:45,394 --> 00:27:48,102
He has already proposed,
so I'll accept his proposal.

516
00:27:49,628 --> 00:27:52,961
So, you won't accept his love
regardless of getting a visa or not.

517
00:27:53,269 --> 00:27:54,362
Yeah

518
00:27:54,477 --> 00:27:55,811
Why don't you tell him that?

519
00:27:55,893 --> 00:27:58,060
How can you talk so being a girl?

520
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:00,519
Who is a boyfriend?

521
00:28:00,644 --> 00:28:04,435
He is our Flipkart, Swiggy, Ola,
BookMyShow and a credit card.

522
00:28:04,935 --> 00:28:07,040
He's a confused character

523
00:28:07,217 --> 00:28:10,278
who'll create a beautiful
environment between parents and husband.

524
00:28:10,478 --> 00:28:11,893
How can we let go of such a person?

525
00:28:11,918 --> 00:28:13,669
Will you just use him and discard?

526
00:28:13,852 --> 00:28:14,732
What's wrong in it?

527
00:28:14,815 --> 00:28:15,907
Yeah! What's wrong in it?

528
00:28:17,269 --> 00:28:18,727
Mr Srinu, what do you know?

529
00:28:18,811 --> 00:28:20,060
I need not know anything.

530
00:28:20,269 --> 00:28:21,602
My baby is always right.

531
00:28:21,727 --> 00:28:23,394
-What, baby?
-Yeah.

532
00:28:28,518 --> 00:28:31,644
Umm... I'm getting late for
my class. I'm going. Okay? Bye.

533
00:28:32,394 --> 00:28:35,060
Actually, the reason why I
came to Hyderabad is that...

534
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:36,811
Do you have to tell it out to me?

535
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:39,435
Do you think that I don't
understand what's in your heart?

536
00:28:42,935 --> 00:28:45,686
Next time,
we shall meet privately without her.

537
00:28:46,352 --> 00:28:47,727
Personally... Okay?

538
00:28:48,102 --> 00:28:49,052
Bye.

539
00:28:58,102 --> 00:28:59,143
Mr Srinu.

540
00:28:59,935 --> 00:29:03,060
Your baby is a bit commercial.
It might not work out for you.

541
00:29:05,227 --> 00:29:07,060
What do you know?

542
00:29:08,018 --> 00:29:09,811
My baby is as sacred as fire. Fire!

543
00:29:10,352 --> 00:29:12,619
Not paying the bill doesn't
make her commercial.

544
00:29:12,644 --> 00:29:15,067
Look, she left her ice-cream
for me realising my hunger.

545
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:16,477
That is mine.

546
00:29:17,018 --> 00:29:18,852
Your baby swept everything.

547
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:24,102
She might be very hungry.

548
00:29:24,727 --> 00:29:27,060
When will you understand, fool?

549
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:32,143
They're playing around

Hey Srinu! Your Krishnaveni
Veeramachineni has sent a reply.

552
00:29:38,477 --> 00:29:39,702
Come here.

553
00:29:41,102 --> 00:29:42,102
See...

554
00:29:44,727 --> 00:29:47,618

-Wow!

559
00:29:56,394 --> 00:29:58,519
Jyothi from Kukatpally.

560
00:29:59,102 --> 00:30:00,811
I was going through your profile.

561
00:30:01,602 --> 00:30:03,143
Looks pretty interesting.

562
00:30:03,644 --> 00:30:05,018
That's why I've sent you a request.

What are you thinking, Mr Bujji?

567
00:30:10,589 --> 00:30:11,887
Send her the photo of the
gril you met on the train.

568
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:18,435
What happened?

569
00:30:21,477 --> 00:30:22,354
Oh, a flower as her profile
picture in here as well?

570
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:26,310
Hey... Do something. Send her a
photo of an 18-year-old hot-sizzling girl.

571
00:30:26,852 --> 00:30:28,671
-Hot-sizzling girl...
-Hmm...

572
00:30:32,269 --> 00:30:33,893
Hey... What is this?

573
00:30:33,977 --> 00:30:34,992
You have asked for
hot-sizzling girl, right?

574
00:30:35,016 --> 00:30:36,641
Put some clothes to the hot-sizzling
girl and send the photo to her.

575
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:39,577
If we want her to fall in our trap,
our plan must be proper.

576
00:30:39,602 --> 00:30:41,310
A hot-sizzling girl with
clothing... Who is there?

577
00:30:41,394 --> 00:30:42,852
Well... Send a photo of your girlfriend.

578
00:30:43,592 --> 00:30:44,966
No, I won't the photo of my girlfriend.

579
00:30:45,143 --> 00:30:46,185
-Hey, send it.
-Ah!

580
00:30:51,227 --> 00:30:52,310
How, dude?

581
00:30:52,769 --> 00:30:54,727
I don't know, dude.
It just happened.

582
00:30:55,227 --> 00:30:56,769

hold it and click a photo such that the

She is not just astute.
Outrageously insightful!

588
00:31:20,477 --> 00:31:21,477
Do something.

589
00:31:21,644 --> 00:31:22,893
Call your girlfriend.

590
00:31:23,018 --> 00:31:24,995
Ask her to click a photo holding
today's newspaper and send it to you.

591
00:31:25,435 --> 00:31:28,352
Well... There is a small technical
problem in this. So that's not possible.

592
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,644
-Technical problem?
-Yeah.

593
00:31:29,669 --> 00:31:30,766
What is it?

594
00:31:30,791 --> 00:31:33,998
I had a quarrel with my
girlfriend four days ago.

595
00:31:34,102 --> 00:31:35,477
We are not in talking terms now.

596
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,935
So she will not send her photo.

597
00:31:37,227 --> 00:31:38,227
Call her number, I will speak with her.

598
00:31:38,252 --> 00:31:41,911
Not possible, dude. I've deleted
her phone number after that fight.

599
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:44,352
So, I am sorry. Don't mind.

600
00:31:45,435 --> 00:31:46,269
Tell the truth.

601
00:31:46,324 --> 00:31:49,409
Well, the photo that I've
sent is not my girlfriend's.

602
00:31:50,269 --> 00:31:52,600
As I don't want to involve my
girlfriend in your family brawl,

603
00:31:52,671 --> 00:31:54,360
I've sent a random
photo from Google.

604
00:31:55,435 --> 00:31:57,143
You've ruined everything!

605
00:31:57,168 --> 00:31:58,418
I doubted you when I saw the photo.

606
00:31:58,543 --> 00:31:59,535
Rascal!

607
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,322
She's asking for a photo.
What shall we do now?

608
00:32:01,347 --> 00:32:02,513
How about we edit the
photo using 'Photoshop'?

609
00:32:02,532 --> 00:32:03,163
You...

610
00:32:03,363 --> 00:32:04,473
No... No... No...

611
00:32:04,498 --> 00:32:05,912
Since I have brought this problem,

612
00:32:05,937 --> 00:32:06,947
I will handle this case.

613
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:09,119
-Please, give me one chance.
-Do whatever you want. Damn!

614
00:32:10,143 --> 00:32:12,519
I did not buy today's newspaper.

615
00:32:13,018 --> 00:32:16,712
I will buy it tomorrow and
send my picture with it.

00:32:33,294 --> 00:32:34,294
She is scolding us.

623
00:32:34,644 --> 00:32:36,644
Now, she knows that the
profile belongs to me.

You've ruined everything! Bloody moron!

never get a girlfriend.

she'll use you and dump.</i>

Will any guy talk to her gently?

-Yes.

Thank you!

00:33:02,026 --> 00:33:04,303
I will keep in touch with
you after going to the USA.

634
00:33:04,595 --> 00:33:06,178
America is not so far.

635
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,978
It is just a psychological distance.

636
00:33:08,353 --> 00:33:11,395
Even if I get engaged to someone else,
I'll keep talking to you.

637
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:16,478
You gave me that facility as well?

-Yeah
-What else?

639
00:33:17,853 --> 00:33:20,228
There is a 'Swagruha Foods'
store in your colony.

640
00:33:20,645 --> 00:33:22,020
They make delicious pickles.

641
00:33:22,353 --> 00:33:24,020
Keep sending them regularly.

We'd be having some cute and
sweet conversations, right?

-Almost everything.

It's alright if you have heard us.

650
00:33:45,397 --> 00:33:46,804
But there are still some
things we didn't discuss yet.

00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:48,687
So, maintain some distance, please.

You didn't even properly show anything,
yet you've totally exploited me.

How will you go?

666
00:34:27,645 --> 00:34:30,812
You've eloped with Krishnaveni
Veeramachineni, along with her jewellery.

667
00:34:30,937 --> 00:34:32,353
How can you go back without her?

668
00:34:32,895 --> 00:34:35,353
Mr Bujji,
your Krishnaveni is very powerful.

669
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,937
She just cursed you
and Srujana dumped you.

00:34:38,645 --> 00:34:40,395
-Give me soda.
-Damn her!

671
00:34:45,983 --> 00:34:47,061
Damn!

672
00:34:47,103 --> 00:34:49,562
It feels like I'm buying duty free
misfortune just by chatting with her.

673
00:34:51,570 --> 00:34:52,891
It's okay.
It's okay.

674
00:34:55,103 --> 00:34:56,603
-Pass the chips.
-Buddy...

00:34:57,187 --> 00:34:58,646
I've had some feelings for Srujana, right?

676
00:34:58,790 --> 00:34:59,198
Hmm.

677
00:34:59,812 --> 00:35:01,895
That is the reason I slipped away from
my home and came here for her, right?

678
00:35:02,812 --> 00:35:05,353
Then, why am I not feeling any
pain when broke up with me?

679
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:10,259
I've been only mad about

680
00:35:10,359 --> 00:35:12,223
getting dumped in front of Swati
and stood like a fool before her.

681
00:35:12,395 --> 00:35:14,620
But I don't feel any
pain of the love failure.

682
00:35:14,645 --> 00:35:16,270
Does it mean that my feelings are dead?

683
00:35:16,462 --> 00:35:18,603
-Have I turned into a stone?
-Hey... Hey...

684
00:35:18,645 --> 00:35:20,287
You want the feeling of
pain of love failure, right?

685
00:35:20,312 --> 00:35:22,187
Prepare a double strong peg.

686
00:35:24,891 --> 00:35:26,641
Enough... Drink it.

687
00:35:26,853 --> 00:35:28,895
Close your eyes, gulp it and

688
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:30,634
think about Srujana from
the bottom of your heart.

689
00:35:30,875 --> 00:35:32,272
And then you'll ooze the
feeling of love failure

690
00:35:32,426 --> 00:35:35,834
from your heart, eyes, nerves and blood

691
00:35:36,228 --> 00:35:37,645

thought about Srujana
from the bottom of my heart.

695
00:35:53,145 --> 00:35:54,099
But... Puff!

696
00:35:55,353 --> 00:35:57,228
-Why am I seeing Swati instead of Srujana?
-Hey...

697
00:35:57,603 --> 00:35:59,062
-Mr Bujji...
-What are you talking?

698
00:35:59,128 --> 00:36:00,587
I don't understand anything.

699
00:36:00,895 --> 00:36:02,770
Hey... Try it one more time.

700
00:36:02,937 --> 00:36:04,395
Please, pour some.

701
00:36:12,895 --> 00:36:15,978
Congratulations dude! You've proved
you're an engineering student.

702
00:36:16,187 --> 00:36:18,812
-Congratulations! [phone ringing]
-Dude.. Swathi is calling.

703
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:19,645

-Hello...

Hi.

706
00:36:21,603 --> 00:36:23,437
Hi, are you okay?

707
00:36:23,578 --> 00:36:26,603
-Yeah, I'm okay.
-I just wanted to ask you

708
00:36:27,937 --> 00:36:29,978
If someone close to us is in pain,

709
00:36:30,312 --> 00:36:31,645
we can't take it.

710
00:36:32,353 --> 00:36:33,645
Are you sure, you're okay?

711
00:36:33,812 --> 00:36:36,334
Yeah, I'm totally okay. Thank you!

712
00:36:36,359 --> 00:36:37,509
Bye.

What happened?

730
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:49,374
Any living being has it's mother
beside it when it takes birth.

731
00:38:49,795 --> 00:38:51,276
But it's different for these tortoises.

Mr Swamy Naidu, don't ruin
our honour and humiliate us.

Koteshwar Rao, don't talk too much.

755
00:41:12,798 --> 00:41:14,715
Your son has already
ruined your honour long ago.

756
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,798
What else is left for me
to ruin it further?

757
00:41:18,218 --> 00:41:18,901
Hello, aunt.

758
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:20,423
Please don't mind but

759
00:41:20,507 --> 00:41:22,007
I cannot give you money this time.

760
00:41:22,032 --> 00:41:22,782
Why do you say that?

761
00:41:22,958 --> 00:41:25,206
His mother has been promptly repaying
your amount every month, right?

762
00:41:25,406 --> 00:41:26,397
She hasn't been repaying.

763
00:41:26,597 --> 00:41:28,723
I heard that they
were in financial crisis.

764
00:41:29,132 --> 00:41:30,299
My husband told that

765
00:41:30,475 --> 00:41:33,637
they have become bankrupt and have
kept all their properties for sale.

766
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:35,798
Don't take it in the
wrong way. Please leave.

767
00:41:36,848 --> 00:41:38,307
We should do something!

768
00:41:38,408 --> 00:41:40,799
Her mother... Her mother...

769
00:41:40,999 --> 00:41:42,423
We should do something about her mother.

770
00:41:42,723 --> 00:41:43,495
Babu bro...

771
00:41:44,465 --> 00:41:46,215
-What?
-Shall I upload it on Youtube?

772
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,282
Show it to me.

773
00:41:50,083 --> 00:41:52,154
To grow beautiful hair... Umm... Damn!

774
00:41:52,365 --> 00:41:53,782
What's that title? It is very repulsive.

775
00:41:54,056 --> 00:41:55,431
That title won't attract viewers.

776
00:41:55,557 --> 00:41:56,923
Do something.

777
00:41:58,063 --> 00:41:59,980
Put the title as
'Do anyone has it so long?'

778
00:42:00,465 --> 00:42:01,740
It'll earn one lakh clicks in a day.

779
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:03,657
Brother, the subject is
about the hair, right?

780
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,419
And what I've been
talking is also about the hair.

781
00:42:05,573 --> 00:42:06,923
The viewers wouldn't know that
until they watch. [phone ringing]

782
00:42:08,157 --> 00:42:10,614
Hey Bobby,
I want you to do something for me.

783
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:27,673
-Finish it quickly.
-Greetings, madam.

784
00:42:28,298 --> 00:42:30,757
-Greetings.
-I need to talk to you personally.

785
00:42:31,323 --> 00:42:34,157
-Tell me
-It's a bit personal, madam.

786
00:42:34,282 --> 00:42:35,446
Oh!

787
00:42:35,723 --> 00:42:38,140
-Rangaswamy, please wait outside.
-Okay, madam.

788
00:42:40,507 --> 00:42:41,673
Only for five minutes.

789
00:42:43,215 --> 00:42:45,257
-Tell me the matter clearly.
-Nothing, madam.

790
00:42:45,548 --> 00:42:49,173
I got a contract of CC road.
You might be knowing it.

791
00:42:50,090 --> 00:42:52,465
-So?
-It's a huge contract

792
00:42:52,590 --> 00:42:55,632
It costs a huge amount for
cement, stone, sand and iron.

793
00:42:55,715 --> 00:42:57,215
On top of the,
there's been inflated prices outside.

794
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:58,382
You should help me with this.

795
00:42:58,407 --> 00:43:01,823
Ensure small deviations
in technical specifications.

796
00:43:02,157 --> 00:43:05,115
That's it, madam.
I'll give you your share.

797
00:43:06,948 --> 00:43:08,198
How much can you pay?

798
00:43:09,048 --> 00:43:10,382
[stammers]

799
00:43:11,448 --> 00:43:13,007
I can give you upto 25 lakh rupees.

800
00:43:13,215 --> 00:43:15,215
You said it is a big contract

801
00:43:16,007 --> 00:43:17,729
-but twenty five lakhs is way too less.
-Madam.

802
00:43:18,007 --> 00:43:20,548
I cannot afford more than that.
There are many others who I should pay.

803
00:43:20,657 --> 00:43:21,907
Fix on 25 lakh rupees.

804
00:43:22,288 --> 00:43:23,115
Okay.

805
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:25,448
-Did you get any amount now?
-Yes, madam.

806
00:43:27,323 --> 00:43:29,157
Here is the amount of two
lakh lakhs rupees as advance.

807
00:43:38,012 --> 00:43:39,732
Bro, what happened?
Did she take the amount?

808
00:43:39,771 --> 00:43:40,499
[talking gibberish]

809
00:43:41,032 --> 00:43:42,365
Did she take the amount?

810
00:43:45,490 --> 00:43:47,323
What are you thinking about me?

811
00:43:47,710 --> 00:43:49,848
-Did you come here knowing about me?
-I thought I know everything, madam.

812
00:43:49,973 --> 00:43:52,091
-Will you dare to come around here?
-No!

813
00:43:52,116 --> 00:43:53,366
-What will you do now?
-Jump!

814
00:43:53,591 --> 00:43:55,324
-Wait!
-Take this amount.

815
00:43:55,349 --> 00:43:56,489
Thanks, madam.

816
00:43:56,747 --> 00:43:57,490
Wait.

817
00:43:57,615 --> 00:43:59,630
Don't put it in your pocket.
Put it in that box.

818
00:43:59,830 --> 00:44:01,600
Madam, what nonsense? Are you serious?

819
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:04,244
-Two lakh rupees for foundation?
-Shut up! Put the amount!

820
00:44:04,342 --> 00:44:05,389
You are a heartless, madam!

821
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:07,968
Leave.

822
00:44:11,382 --> 00:44:14,048
I didn't expect honest officers
in the government office, bro.

823
00:44:14,073 --> 00:44:16,198
-This will not work out, bro.
-Ok, leave it.

824
00:44:16,223 --> 00:44:17,890
Hey, what about my two lakh rupees?

825
00:44:18,090 --> 00:44:20,008
I'll send them through Paytm. Hang up.

826
00:44:21,115 --> 00:44:22,710
It didn't work out from that side as well.

827
00:44:24,715 --> 00:44:27,173
Things are not moving despite
spending 24 hours on Facebook.

828
00:44:27,257 --> 00:44:29,132
And Babu's idea too didn't work out.
[message notification tone]

829
00:44:31,132 --> 00:44:34,382
Hey, she has tagged her
location as Ahoy, Madhapur.

830
00:44:35,548 --> 00:44:39,465
It means... Banjara Hills, Jubilee Hills,
SR Nagar, Madhapur, Ameerpet...

831
00:44:39,798 --> 00:44:42,507
-She must be in this 10 kilometres radius.
-Yeah, exactly!

832
00:44:42,707 --> 00:44:44,484
-Ouch!
-Hey, what happened?

833
00:44:45,257 --> 00:44:46,382
I'm fine.

834
00:44:48,032 --> 00:44:49,340
Seems like you've
been into heavy shopping.

835
00:44:49,365 --> 00:44:50,230
We would've

836
00:44:50,407 --> 00:44:52,878
gone to Madhapur together in the
same cab if you had told me before.

837
00:44:53,071 --> 00:44:54,732
-There is a 50% sale too.
-Hey...

838
00:44:55,015 --> 00:44:57,807
How do you know that I went to
Madhapur? I didn't inform you, right?

839
00:44:57,932 --> 00:44:59,891
You tagged your location
on Facebook, right?

840
00:45:01,015 --> 00:45:03,348
Then, would my family know
that I'm in Hyderabad?

841
00:45:04,149 --> 00:45:05,274
And Bujji as well?

842
00:45:05,490 --> 00:45:07,240
-How's my dress?
-Move.

843
00:45:07,365 --> 00:45:09,073
I should first delete that location tag.

844
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:11,615
My new dress...
I got this in offer.

845
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:14,340
I will not get another one like this.
See how it got wrinkled.

846
00:45:14,715 --> 00:45:16,798
Hey, she has deleted the location tag.

847
00:45:18,032 --> 00:45:20,282
Why are you behaving
like a Big Boss contestant?

848
00:45:20,407 --> 00:45:22,198
Do you think Bujji saw that tag?

849
00:45:22,365 --> 00:45:25,157
Why don't you unfriend and
block him when you're so scared?

850
00:45:27,115 --> 00:45:28,443
Since this is the only way
for Bujji to contact us,

851
00:45:28,660 --> 00:45:30,444
he's been not finding an alternative.

852
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:34,292
We don't know how he is going to
contact us other than this method.

853
00:45:36,740 --> 00:45:38,573
I'm getting tensed because of him.

854
00:45:38,948 --> 00:45:40,657
If I take stress, I'll get pimples.

855
00:45:40,973 --> 00:45:42,182
Did I get any? Look.

856
00:45:42,777 --> 00:45:43,443
Hmm...

857
00:45:47,057 --> 00:45:49,223
I should be very careful from now.

858
00:45:50,865 --> 00:45:51,948
Damn!

859
00:45:52,157 --> 00:45:54,220
We've been unable to catch
Krishnaveni despite knowing that

860
00:45:54,234 --> 00:45:55,448
she's is here in Hyderabad.

861
00:45:55,698 --> 00:45:57,101
This is very terrible.

862
00:45:57,532 --> 00:46:00,240
How can we search for her without
even knowing how she looks?

863
00:46:00,907 --> 00:46:01,990
Cheers!

00:46:06,115 --> 00:46:07,310
Hello!

866
00:46:07,899 --> 00:46:08,939
[laughs hysterically]

867
00:46:09,139 --> 00:46:10,589
When are you inviting us
for your wedding feast?

868
00:46:10,823 --> 00:46:11,951
-Satya?
-Yes.

869
00:46:12,407 --> 00:46:13,740
Who gave you my phone number?

870
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:17,532
I swear, I won't share Bujji's
phone number with anyone.

871
00:46:18,245 --> 00:46:19,324
Ouch!

872
00:46:20,282 --> 00:46:22,782
Raju is also here.
He wants to talk to you.

873
00:46:23,147 --> 00:46:23,990
-Here.
-Give me.

874
00:46:24,090 --> 00:46:25,548
Congratulations, buddy!

875
00:46:26,073 --> 00:46:28,040
We heard that it is Chamundeshwari's
daughter Krishnaveni.

876
00:46:28,490 --> 00:46:29,698
Super figure, dude!

877
00:46:29,865 --> 00:46:31,865
Lower the volume of your voices. It is
as if you are speaking to me directly.

878
00:46:32,115 --> 00:46:33,115
Give the phone to Satya.

879
00:46:33,282 --> 00:46:34,990
-Tell me
-Don't share my number with anyone.

880
00:46:35,198 --> 00:46:36,573
Where did you go all these days?

881
00:46:36,698 --> 00:46:38,073
-That is...
-Alright.

882
00:46:38,198 --> 00:46:40,282
-Krishnaveni...
-She is Chamundeshwari's daughter.

883
00:46:41,073 --> 00:46:42,090
Yeah!

884
00:46:42,115 --> 00:46:43,407
Send her photo to me.

885
00:46:43,432 --> 00:46:44,757
Why do you ask for her photo
when she is right beside you?

886
00:46:44,782 --> 00:46:46,371
Click a selfie.
It is the latest fashion.

887
00:46:46,396 --> 00:46:49,190
Don't irritate me and do what I say.

888
00:46:49,490 --> 00:46:50,620
Passport size photo will also do.

889
00:46:50,645 --> 00:46:52,378
You need Krishnaveni's passport, right?

890
00:46:52,478 --> 00:46:53,788
-Yeah
-I will take care. Hang up.

891
00:46:53,817 --> 00:46:55,275
-Careful, dude.
-Just hang up.

892
00:47:00,865 --> 00:47:02,907
What will she do with so much
money? Just pay her fifty rupees.

893
00:47:04,032 --> 00:47:06,365
Here. You have understood
what we told you, right?

894
00:47:06,615 --> 00:47:08,615
Stay here, sir.
I will get it within the time of a snap.

895
00:47:09,157 --> 00:47:10,915
[snaps] Where is it? Go and get it.

896
00:47:11,357 --> 00:47:12,685
Bloody TV influence!

897
00:47:16,448 --> 00:47:18,615
Does she know what a passport is?

898
00:47:18,740 --> 00:47:19,990
I doubt she might get a
ration card or some other card.

899
00:47:20,123 --> 00:47:22,115
[scoffs] I told her very clearly.
I'm confident that she'd bring it.

900
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:23,598
-Clearly?
-Look, she's coming.

901
00:47:25,456 --> 00:47:26,510
Wow!

902
00:47:26,615 --> 00:47:28,407
She is such a trustworthy maid!

903
00:47:28,490 --> 00:47:30,490
There must be one like her in every home.

904
00:47:36,282 --> 00:47:37,865
Very trustworthy maid!

905
00:47:38,032 --> 00:47:39,573
You should have given
her fifty rupees more.

906
00:47:45,746 --> 00:47:47,907
-Get to your work.
-One minute.

907
00:47:50,073 --> 00:47:51,115
-Good luck!
-Hey... Tsk!

908
00:47:54,548 --> 00:47:56,276
How long will you stare
at us? Quickly bash us.

909
00:47:56,476 --> 00:47:58,173
Take the rest of the money and bash them.

911
00:47:59,532 --> 00:48:01,073
They hit me on the wrong place.

912
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:03,573
-Stop it. Get up.
-Please...

913
00:48:04,615 --> 00:48:06,850
Tell me now,
why do you need her passport?

914
00:48:06,983 --> 00:48:07,459
Which girl, sir?

915
00:48:08,048 --> 00:48:09,115
Bujji asked us to do so, sir.

916
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:11,232
It means you have Bujji's number.

917
00:48:11,323 --> 00:48:12,532
-No, sir.
-Yes, sir.

918

[groans in pain]

919
00:48:15,282 --> 00:48:16,948
I'm breaking the promise.

920
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:18,777
Then, call Bujji.

I'll be right back.

926
00:48:37,990 --> 00:48:39,865
-Did you find it?
-What is that?

927
00:48:40,115 --> 00:48:41,865
-We got them.
-Who is it?

928
00:48:41,948 --> 00:48:43,990
I'm Krishnaveni's uncle.

929
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:45,698
-Uncle... Actually what happened was...
<i>-Hey!</i>

930
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:48,282
<i>-Don't connect any relations.</i>
-What relation?

931
00:48:48,448 --> 00:48:51,298
-I asked him to get her photo.
-Not photo, you wanted her passport.

932
00:48:51,323 --> 00:48:53,456
Passport?
What will I do with that?

933
00:48:53,556 --> 00:48:55,240
That is the reason you
have called them, right?

934
00:48:56,448 --> 00:48:58,798
-Give the phone to that idiots.
-Not me. He is the idiot.

935
00:48:58,823 --> 00:49:01,198
The phone is on speaker mode.
You can talk to any idiot.

936
00:49:01,282 --> 00:49:02,448
What did I ask you?

937
00:49:02,473 --> 00:49:04,640
Bujji, you're doing this
because we got caught, right?

938
00:49:04,744 --> 00:49:06,090
You asked for her passport, right?

939
00:49:06,115 --> 00:49:07,782
Didn't you plan a foreign
tour with Krishnaveni?

940
00:49:07,807 --> 00:49:10,016
Hey... What are you talking?

941
00:49:12,448 --> 00:49:15,115
I think he's busy
Why don't we do this another day?

-He'll be right back in five minutes.
-No, it's ok

We'll just set it up...
Maybe tomorrow? In my office.

Okay. The investor has left.

-What do you mean?

00:49:48,870 --> 00:49:50,882
We are searching for her
in every lane in Chennai.

958
00:49:50,907 --> 00:49:52,740
Why are you searching in Chennai when
I and your daughter are in Hyderabad?

-You gave me very good information.
-Information? What is it?

963
00:50:01,157 --> 00:50:03,532
You said that Krishnaveni is with you.

964
00:50:03,615 --> 00:50:05,532
I didn't mean that.

Oh you understood!
It's Sundar Pillai.

974
00:50:23,473 --> 00:50:25,073

Okay.

984
00:50:40,465 --> 00:50:42,548
He ate those Swagruha
pickles which you have sent.

985
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:44,028
He asked me to tell you
that they were very tasty.

986
00:50:44,287 --> 00:50:44,882
It's okay.

987

-No! They are finished.

Of course, I should
buy them and send them.

Boyfriend is like a Lux soap
when you are in a relationship.

You'd use him to rub all over your body.

993

After a breakup, you use him like a
Dettol soap, only to wash your hands.

-What is cute in this?

00:53:00,323 --> 00:53:01,657
Is this your ISD call?

1035
00:53:01,682 --> 00:53:03,798
No! That was a totally
different phone call than this.

1036
00:53:03,823 --> 00:53:05,865
-Actually, I got two calls.
-Do you have any sense?

An investor has come to us.

1038

You, me and all our friends can
get settled with this project.

1039
00:53:11,482 --> 00:53:14,565
But you've ignored this and were supplying
pickles to the girl who dumped you.

1040
00:53:14,698 --> 00:53:15,293
What should I think about it?

1041
00:53:15,386 --> 00:53:15,987
Is it just pickles

1042
00:53:16,062 --> 00:53:18,721
or pumpkin snacks from Begum
Bazaar and bangles from Old City as well?

1043

Look, you are angry.
I'll talk to you later. Bye.

Wait. Where are you going?

1045

Since you have mentioned pumpkin snacks,

1046
00:53:25,282 --> 00:53:26,538
I just remembered that
she is very fond of those.

1047
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:45,157

You told me this on Whatsapp.

1054
00:54:14,858 --> 00:54:16,984
I got two ISD calls instantly.
What can I do about that?

Damn!

1060
00:54:29,692 --> 00:54:33,567
She said she's not able to eat anything in
America and might die out of hunger.

1061
00:54:33,650 --> 00:54:36,817
So I said I'll send her these pickles
as a charity so that she'd survive.

1062

It feels so soothing
listening to your smile.

You've saved the turtle
eggs on the other day, right?

-Why?
-Vastu isn't good at that place.

not yielding good results.

01:15:35,634 --> 01:15:36,695
More...

1373
01:15:41,636 --> 01:15:42,922
Don't drink it undiluted, dear.

1374
01:15:43,068 --> 01:15:44,278
I'll add a little water.

1375
01:15:47,011 --> 01:15:49,216
Are you feeling bad that I am boozing?

1376
01:15:49,321 --> 01:15:50,696
Nothing like that, dear.

1377
01:15:50,707 --> 01:15:53,075
-This is just your second peg. Have it.
-Okay.

1378
01:15:55,817 --> 01:15:56,952
Daddy

1379
01:15:57,052 --> 01:15:58,776
What is your opinion on Bujji?

1380
01:15:58,987 --> 01:16:00,044
He is a golden boy, dear.

1381
01:16:00,341 --> 01:16:02,225
-Ah! What?
-He is a rascal!

1382
01:16:02,325 --> 01:16:03,724
He is the epitome of worthlessness.

1383
01:16:04,782 --> 01:16:05,849
Yeah.

1384
01:16:05,874 --> 01:16:08,007
Daddy, did I scold you in this flow?

1385
01:16:08,438 --> 01:16:09,660
No, dear.

1386
01:16:09,801 --> 01:16:10,872
Okay.

1387
01:16:14,031 --> 01:16:15,503
I just remembered something.

1388
01:16:15,846 --> 01:16:19,744
Hitmen and thugs who'd break someone's
arms and legs upon getting paid...

1389
01:16:20,387 --> 01:16:21,389
Yeah

1390
01:16:21,414 --> 01:16:23,414
Do we have their numbers
in our phone book, daddy?

1391
01:16:23,439 --> 01:16:24,704
Yeah, dear. But why?

1392
01:16:26,079 --> 01:16:29,278
It is alright if we spent 10 lakh
rupees... Just call them, daddy.

1393
01:16:29,616 --> 01:16:31,718
We should get Bujji killed. Call them.

1394
01:16:31,918 --> 01:16:33,393
Why now, dear?
Let's do it tomorrow.

1395
01:16:34,237 --> 01:16:36,065
Daddy, who'd inherit all this property?

1396
01:16:36,090 --> 01:16:37,132
Of course you, dear.

1397
01:16:37,157 --> 01:16:38,562
Then, what are you thinking?

1398
01:16:38,573 --> 01:16:40,133
Nothing like that, dear.

1399
01:16:48,094 --> 01:16:51,163
Bujji has ruined my life, daddy!

1400
01:16:53,047 --> 01:16:58,477
He just uprooted my life, which is
like a plant and fed it to the goat.

1401
01:16:58,925 --> 01:17:01,644
Just like they sacrifice
a goat at the tribal temple...

1402
01:17:01,719 --> 01:17:02,991
this guy should be sacrificed ruthlessly.

1403
01:17:03,578 --> 01:17:04,890
What's with your language, dear?

1404
01:17:04,932 --> 01:17:08,935
My language and body language
become crooked when I talk about him.

1405
01:17:12,149 --> 01:17:15,323
Daddy, don't call anybody.

1406
01:17:17,219 --> 01:17:18,332
It is you who should kill him.

1407
01:17:19,713 --> 01:17:21,561
-Let's go. We'll kill him.
-Dear... Dear...

1408
01:17:21,586 --> 01:17:23,949
-Dear, do you think it's that easy?
-Let's go. We'll kill him.

1409
01:17:24,514 --> 01:17:26,873
-What happened son-in-law?
-He must die today

1410
01:17:28,227 --> 01:17:29,979
Oh no! Son-in-law...

1411
01:17:30,036 --> 01:17:31,658
She got to know it!

1412
01:17:31,758 --> 01:17:33,270
-Son-in-law...
-Mother-in-law...

1413
01:17:33,473 --> 01:17:37,845
-You are boozing along with your daughter.
-[sarcastically imitating]

1414
01:17:37,945 --> 01:17:38,815
Oh God!

1415
01:17:39,003 --> 01:17:41,327
How can you booze along
with my granddaughter?

1416
01:17:41,527 --> 01:17:43,629
It is your granddaughter who is
boozing along with your son-in-law.

1417
01:17:44,180 --> 01:17:45,667
Sit down. Sit.

1418
01:17:49,196 --> 01:17:50,284
Do you want to have a peg?

1419
01:17:52,768 --> 01:17:55,029
What? Your word is my word?

1420
01:17:57,440 --> 01:17:58,759
What is this?

1421
01:17:58,801 --> 01:18:01,202
Why're you fixing my wedding

1422
01:18:01,394 --> 01:18:04,015
without my consent as if
you don't have any other work?

1423
01:18:04,215 --> 01:18:10,067
If you would have told us your opinion,
we wouldn't have fixed it.

1424
01:18:10,826 --> 01:18:11,910
What should I say?

1425
01:18:12,182 --> 01:18:13,879
Well... I have informed this rogue!

1426
01:18:13,890 --> 01:18:15,001
Rogue?

1427
01:18:15,026 --> 01:18:16,036
I have informed you as well.

1428
01:18:16,710 --> 01:18:18,272
And that woman... my mother...
doesn't she know my feelings?

1429
01:18:19,128 --> 01:18:22,028
Attending office with big
glasses is not what she should do!

1430
01:18:22,039 --> 01:18:23,071
Oh God!

1431
01:18:23,096 --> 01:18:25,266
Daddy, I have a small idea.

1432
01:18:25,291 --> 01:18:27,582
-Tell me.
-Grandma, bless me.

1433
01:18:29,224 --> 01:18:31,938
The wedding will not happen
if we kill this old hag, right?

1434
01:18:31,949 --> 01:18:33,125
Excellent idea, dear!

1435
01:18:33,347 --> 01:18:34,784
Your wedding certainly
won't happen until a year.

1436
01:18:34,795 --> 01:18:35,994
Really dad? Sure?

1437
01:18:36,098 --> 01:18:38,151
Yeah. Certainly. On top of that,
we can bury her inside the house.

1438
01:18:38,162 --> 01:18:40,141
-It is safe
-Then, just kill her.

1439
01:18:40,352 --> 01:18:43,109
Son-in-law... Son-in-law...

1440
01:18:44,337 --> 01:18:45,630
-Mother-in-law... Mother-in-law...
-Daddy...

1441
01:18:45,655 --> 01:18:48,408
-you cannot do this. I will kill her.
-Oh no!

1442
01:18:48,608 --> 01:18:49,684
Wait, you old hag. Stop, you old hag.

1443
01:18:49,695 --> 01:18:51,853
-Careful
-Daddy, out of the way.

1444
01:18:51,864 --> 01:18:55,785
-Is she going to kill me or what?
-Stop, you old hag. I will kill you.

1445
01:18:57,929 --> 01:18:59,716
What is all this, son-in-law?

1446
01:18:59,904 --> 01:19:02,216
-Why did you come in between?
-As I didn't have any sense.

1447
01:19:02,391 --> 01:19:04,654
Don't tell all this to my daughter.

1448
01:19:04,772 --> 01:19:06,294
You too don't tell her
about the things here.

1449
01:19:06,305 --> 01:19:07,888
I will not tell her. My ill-fate!

1450
01:19:08,843 --> 01:19:10,280
She has created a big mess!

1451
01:19:10,445 --> 01:19:11,606
She proved that she is her daughter.

1452
01:19:13,082 --> 01:19:14,507
I need to have a
smoke immediately

1453
01:19:15,849 --> 01:19:17,752
I'm getting crushed between
this mother and daughter.

1454
01:19:37,908 --> 01:19:40,381
Why are you still doubtful when
you are seeing two shadows?

1455
01:19:40,581 --> 01:19:41,581
Oh!

1456
01:19:42,406 --> 01:19:43,260
[sighs]

1457
01:19:43,787 --> 01:19:44,879
You?

1458
01:19:45,267 --> 01:19:47,146
I came here to apologise to Krishnaveni.

1459
01:19:47,822 --> 01:19:50,050
Why did you jump over
the gate? It is unlocked.

1460
01:19:50,061 --> 01:19:51,381
I didn't see it, uncle.

1461
01:19:51,548 --> 01:19:53,259
-What about doorbell?
-I didn't get that idea, uncle.

1462
01:19:54,876 --> 01:19:56,797
You came here to
apologise to her at this time?

1463
01:19:56,808 --> 01:19:59,397
Well, I've been worried that she
might feel bad for getting her caught.

1464
01:19:59,849 --> 01:20:00,782
I hope she isn't feeling bad, right uncle?

1465
01:20:00,954 --> 01:20:02,482
No... Nothing like that.

1466
01:20:03,142 --> 01:20:05,142
She just wants to kill you. That's it.

1467
01:20:06,298 --> 01:20:07,908
Don't hang around this
surroundings for some days.

1468
01:20:07,972 --> 01:20:10,654
She wants to hire thugs to
get your body parts chopped.

1469
01:20:11,212 --> 01:20:12,244
That's not the case, uncle.

1470
01:20:12,269 --> 01:20:14,501
Well... It is not safe for you
to stay here for a longer period.

1471
01:20:14,747 --> 01:20:16,306
I am advising you as you a fellow man,
come with me. I'll drop you.

1472
01:20:16,434 --> 01:20:18,633
-I'll go by myself, uncle.
-Come with me, I'll drop you.

1473
01:20:18,783 --> 01:20:20,508
To hell with these contractors!

1474
01:20:22,236 --> 01:20:23,604
Wait, I'm coming. Hold on.

1475
01:20:27,697 --> 01:20:29,438
How come you are dropping him?

1476
01:20:29,902 --> 01:20:31,902
I saw your son jumping over my gate.

1477
01:20:31,912 --> 01:20:33,161
-Oh no!
-So, I came here to drop him.

1478
01:20:33,172 --> 01:20:35,106
Will you not let us live in peace?

1479
01:20:35,267 --> 01:20:37,319
How many more disputes are
you going to get us involved in?

1480
01:20:38,251 --> 01:20:40,342
Sir, he didn't misbehave there, right?

1481
01:20:40,353 --> 01:20:42,158
No, dad.
I went there like a gentleman.

1482
01:20:42,169 --> 01:20:43,874
You jump walls like a Superman

1483
01:20:43,885 --> 01:20:46,068
...and say that you're a
gentleman, fool. Go inside!

1484
01:20:46,720 --> 01:20:47,954
Sorry, sir!

1485
01:20:48,667 --> 01:20:49,809
Don't scold him.

1486
01:20:49,820 --> 01:20:50,963
He's your boy.

1487
01:20:52,048 --> 01:20:54,043
My daughter's wedding is in two days.

1488
01:20:54,337 --> 01:20:54,933
Wedding?

1489
01:20:55,119 --> 01:20:56,423
Why? When? Who is the groom?

1490
01:20:56,623 --> 01:20:58,222
Why do you need all this? Go inside.

1491
01:20:58,298 --> 01:20:59,294
Just to know the information.

1492
01:20:59,319 --> 01:21:00,906
What information do you need? Go!

1493
01:21:01,351 --> 01:21:02,456
Who is the groom?

1494
01:21:03,531 --> 01:21:04,555
Same match.

1495
01:21:04,776 --> 01:21:06,047
It is with her cousin.

1496
01:21:06,697 --> 01:21:08,938
I will invite you to the wedding.
You have to attend without fail.

1497
01:21:09,038 --> 01:21:10,176
-Sure, sir
-See you, sir.

1498
01:21:10,368 --> 01:21:11,164
See you, sir.

1499
01:21:11,989 --> 01:21:13,328
He's coming. Come...

1500
01:21:15,618 --> 01:21:16,871
What's happening in the village?

1501
01:21:17,214 --> 01:21:19,435
I heard that they have fixed the wedding
of Krishnaveni and Subba Rao again.

1502
01:21:19,460 --> 01:21:20,799
He is a very nice guy.

1503
01:21:20,829 --> 01:21:22,415
He is a very innocent guy.

1504
01:21:22,722 --> 01:21:24,583
I feel pity for him.

1505
01:21:24,637 --> 01:21:27,017
-Why dude?
-Krishnaveni eloped with Bujji, right?

1506
01:21:27,423 --> 01:21:30,748
They were together for four months and
came back silently after their breakup.

1507
01:21:31,665 --> 01:21:32,388
Really?

1508
01:21:33,059 --> 01:21:36,394
Of course. Anyway, second
hand is second hand!

1509
01:21:36,482 --> 01:21:41,753
From tomorrow, everyone in the village
will call him 'Second Hand Subba Rao'.

1510
01:21:41,953 --> 01:21:43,969
-[laughs]
-Take out the umbrella

1511
01:21:44,987 --> 01:21:46,232
It is obvious, isn't it?

1512
01:21:49,118 --> 01:21:50,361
Hey, make it fast.

1513
01:21:50,618 --> 01:21:51,691
Why are you so late?

1514
01:21:52,292 --> 01:21:53,330
Of course, it will take time, sir.

1515
01:21:53,341 --> 01:21:56,460
-This is a bicycle, not a motorcycle
-Alright. Get to your work.

1516
01:21:56,471 --> 01:21:58,819
I'll want to buy a motorcycle. Please give
me an advance salary of 5000 rupees, sir.

1517
01:21:58,919 --> 01:22:00,156
What?

1518
01:22:00,250 --> 01:22:01,446
You are getting a
motorcycle for 5000 rupees?

1519
01:22:01,622 --> 01:22:02,496
Of course.

1520
01:22:02,619 --> 01:22:03,920
We'll get a second hand
motorcycle for that amount.

1521
01:22:03,993 --> 01:22:06,271
There are so many advantages
with a second hand motorcycle.

1522
01:22:06,282 --> 01:22:07,972
Since someone might have already used it,

1523
01:22:08,172 --> 01:22:09,822
it would come at a low price and
ownership transfer would be very quick.

1524
01:22:09,897 --> 01:22:10,766
What do you say, sir?

1525
01:22:11,037 --> 01:22:12,458
Oh god! Why are you slapping
me for telling the truth, sir?

1526
01:22:12,632 --> 01:22:13,208
Get to the work.

1527
01:22:14,936 --> 01:22:16,243
Don't you want coconut water?

1528
01:22:16,761 --> 01:22:17,863
Get lost!

1529
01:22:18,380 --> 01:22:19,458
Krishnaveni has got nothing to lose.

1530
01:22:19,469 --> 01:22:21,907
But everyone is irritating
me by calling 'second hand'.

1531
01:22:24,197 --> 01:22:25,394
Hey Bujji, wait

1532
01:22:26,642 --> 01:22:28,063
I'll ask you a question.
Will you tell the truth?

1533
01:22:28,088 --> 01:22:29,128
What truth?

1534
01:22:29,353 --> 01:22:32,330
Nothing happened between you
and Krishnaveni in Hyderabad, right?

1535
01:22:33,142 --> 01:22:35,070
Never ask me that again. No comments.

1536
01:22:35,095 --> 01:22:36,266
No comments?

1537
01:22:36,486 --> 01:22:37,818
Please tell me.

1538
01:22:37,938 --> 01:22:40,243
I don't want to dig the past. No comments!

1539
01:22:40,945 --> 01:22:43,019
Poor guy, Bujji!
Tell him what happened.

1540
01:22:43,390 --> 01:22:44,875
No comments, for you as well.

1541
01:22:45,352 --> 01:22:47,722
Bujji... Hey... Tell me...

1542
01:22:51,217 --> 01:22:52,841
What happened?

1543
01:22:53,249 --> 01:22:56,075
-Aunt, let's postpone the wedding
-Why?

1544
01:22:56,086 --> 01:22:59,044
-Making arrangements in a short notice...
-Come to the point!

1545
01:22:59,321 --> 01:23:00,688
What do you exactly want to say?

1546
01:23:00,713 --> 01:23:04,787
We don't know if Krishnaveni
came back home with the same purity...

1547
01:23:04,798 --> 01:23:06,116
-Hey...
-Shut up!

1548
01:23:06,767 --> 01:23:09,263
If you talk one more word...

1549
01:23:09,462 --> 01:23:10,899
-Listen to me, Aunt.
-No!

1550
01:23:13,182 --> 01:23:15,683
Let's cancel the wedding.
I trust my upbringing.

1551
01:23:15,694 --> 01:23:17,180
My daughter did not
elope with anybody.

1552
01:23:17,205 --> 01:23:19,217
She ran away because she
don't want to marry you...

1553
01:23:19,242 --> 01:23:20,355
all alone.

1554
01:23:20,566 --> 01:23:22,763
-Stop all the wedding works
-We should stop the wedding works.

1555
01:23:22,928 --> 01:23:24,642
What will everyone in
the town think about us?

1556
01:23:25,025 --> 01:23:26,809
Why should I care about what
people in our town think about us?

1557
01:23:27,421 --> 01:23:28,701
All I care is my daughter,

1558
01:23:29,063 --> 01:23:30,271
and her happiness.

1559
01:23:31,557 --> 01:23:33,557
I have trust in my daughter

1560
01:23:34,486 --> 01:23:36,978
Nothing else matters to me
other than her happiness.

1561
01:23:37,239 --> 01:23:38,474
Mom...

1562
01:23:43,729 --> 01:23:45,238
This trust is all I need, mom.

1563
01:23:45,249 --> 01:23:47,227
I will not cross the line ever again.

1564
01:23:47,238 --> 01:23:50,231
I have slapped you on the other day
not because you have slipped away.

1565
01:23:51,143 --> 01:23:54,449
It's because you didn't tell me
that you don't want to marry him.

1566
01:23:54,991 --> 01:23:56,300
I am sorry!

1567
01:23:58,463 --> 01:24:01,576
[singing karaoke]
Singing: "Beat it..."

1568
01:24:01,707 --> 01:24:03,060
You are singing as if a buffalo
is moaning during its labour!

1569
01:24:03,085 --> 01:24:04,419
-Singing: "Beat it... Beat it..."
-Oh! Annoying! Stop it

1570
01:24:04,444 --> 01:24:05,772
-Singing: "Beat it..."
-Hell with your jumping around!

1571
01:24:05,953 --> 01:24:07,062
My ears are vibrating!

1572
01:24:07,531 --> 01:24:10,601
The ritual bell fell into the well
while I was cleaning Pooja items.

1573
01:24:10,612 --> 01:24:11,682
Please fetch it out from the well, dear.

1574
01:24:11,707 --> 01:24:12,554
I need to start the Pooja.

1575
01:24:12,619 --> 01:24:14,285
Why were you cleaning them near a well?

1576
01:24:14,556 --> 01:24:16,079
Stop questioning!
I need that ritual bell right now.

1577
01:24:16,168 --> 01:24:18,540
Oh, you are asking me to fetch
the ritual-bell from the well?

1578
01:24:18,640 --> 01:24:19,417
Why are you whining about it?

1579
01:24:19,517 --> 01:24:21,547
You used to jump and play in the well most
of the time when you're a kid, didn't you?

1580
01:24:21,558 --> 01:24:23,333
I used to be a knucklehead then,
but now, I am a B.Tech graduate.

1581
01:24:23,338 --> 01:24:26,013
People are disparaging engineering
students! You continue, dude.

1582
01:24:26,038 --> 01:24:28,291
Aunt, I've failed in my degree
exams. I'll fetch it for you.

1583
01:24:28,471 --> 01:24:30,185
-Get it, son
-Continue singing.

1584
01:24:30,322 --> 01:24:31,748
That is apt for your face!

1585
01:24:34,494 --> 01:24:35,541
Singing: "Just beat it..."

1586
01:24:37,135 --> 01:24:38,207
Singing: "Beat it..."

1587
01:24:38,540 --> 01:24:39,966
Ah!

1588
01:24:41,174 --> 01:24:43,087
Why did she come here?

1589
01:24:47,869 --> 01:24:50,096
Aunty... Aunty...

1590
01:24:53,744 --> 01:24:56,937
You are Chamundeshwari's
daughter Krishnaveni, right?

1591
01:24:56,948 --> 01:24:58,349
Yes, Aunty.

1592
01:24:58,735 --> 01:25:00,459
What brings you here, dear?

1593
01:25:00,541 --> 01:25:02,643
Oh! Did you come here for Bujji?

1594
01:25:02,654 --> 01:25:03,296
Yeah

1595
01:25:03,422 --> 01:25:05,164
Bujji... Bujji...

1596
01:25:05,657 --> 01:25:06,989
He is in the backyard, dear.

1597
01:25:07,127 --> 01:25:08,415
Go and talk to him.

1598
01:25:08,426 --> 01:25:09,907
I'll get you a cup of coffee.

1599
01:25:10,291 --> 01:25:11,082
Okay, aunty.

1600
01:25:11,863 --> 01:25:13,636
Bujji, I got you!

1601
01:25:22,072 --> 01:25:24,595
-Bujji...
-No... Bujji.

1602
01:25:29,537 --> 01:25:30,896
Greetings

1603
01:25:33,375 --> 01:25:34,744
-Bujji...
-Who is it?

1604
01:25:34,768 --> 01:25:36,382
-It is me... Krishnaveni.
-Yes, tell me.

1605
01:25:36,393 --> 01:25:38,218
Thank you for helping me.

1606
01:25:38,418 --> 01:25:39,205
Okay... Okay...

1607
01:25:39,230 --> 01:25:42,008
-I apologise for the trouble I gave you.
-Apologies accepted.

1608
01:25:42,033 --> 01:25:43,650
If you just come up,

1609
01:25:43,933 --> 01:25:45,128
I'll apologize heartfully.

1610
01:25:45,139 --> 01:25:47,350
Also, I got a gift for you.
I will give it to you and leave.

1611
01:25:47,392 --> 01:25:49,536
I don't need your apologies.
Handover the gift to my mother and leave.

1612
01:25:49,636 --> 01:25:51,053
No, I want to give it to you directly.

1613
01:25:51,164 --> 01:25:52,188
Don't you understand?

1614
01:25:52,272 --> 01:25:53,388
I have so much work in here.

1615
01:25:53,461 --> 01:25:55,461
It'll take 2, 3, 4 to 5 hours to come out.

1616
01:25:55,471 --> 01:25:56,933
It's alright! I'll wait for you.

1617
01:25:56,944 --> 01:25:58,068
Oh man! What is this?

1618
01:25:58,268 --> 01:25:59,973
She's getting latched to me
as if TDP got latched by RGV!

1619
01:26:00,173 --> 01:26:01,563
It might rain.
You go home.

1620
01:26:01,588 --> 01:26:02,799
I won't leave until you come out.

1621
01:26:02,899 --> 01:26:05,456
-Then I won't come even if I die
-You'll not come out? I'll see that.

1622
01:26:06,029 --> 01:26:07,664
You...

1623
01:26:10,916 --> 01:26:12,995
Hey... What are you doing?

1624
01:26:13,006 --> 01:26:14,798
Will you kill my son with that stone?

1625
01:26:15,033 --> 01:26:17,025
I'll complain to your mother
and get you punished.

1626
01:26:17,036 --> 01:26:18,398
You...

1627
01:26:18,760 --> 01:26:19,879
Oh god!

1628
01:26:20,568 --> 01:26:23,203
-Son, come up.
-No, I will not come.

1629
01:26:23,591 --> 01:26:25,208
The girl has left. Come out.

1630
01:26:30,716 --> 01:26:32,630
Come... Come out quickly.

1631
01:26:33,140 --> 01:26:36,609
Let's go to her home and
complain about this to her mother.

1632
01:26:36,620 --> 01:26:37,456
Mom...

1633
01:26:41,338 --> 01:26:42,352
I am sorry, Krishnaveni.

1634
01:26:43,846 --> 01:26:46,280
My father got into financial
pressure because of me.

1635
01:26:48,017 --> 01:26:50,435
And I was blamed for the
mistake which I didn't do.

1636
01:26:50,820 --> 01:26:54,146
Hence, I got no choice but to
handover you to your family members.

1637
01:26:55,018 --> 01:26:59,446
I didn't know at the time that you were
Krishnaveni under the alias name of Swati.

1638
01:27:00,768 --> 01:27:03,471
But after knowing the truth,
I've felt very dejected.

1639
01:27:04,940 --> 01:27:05,966
The feeling of
dejection was so much that...

1640
01:27:06,834 --> 01:27:09,760
-[Satya weeping]
-I'll talk to you about when I meet you.

1641
01:27:10,502 --> 01:27:12,633
You could have told this matter
as well, when you meet her.

1642
01:27:13,138 --> 01:27:14,733
Alright... Tell me the email ID.

1643
01:27:15,513 --> 01:27:16,963
Take a printout.

1644
01:27:22,197 --> 01:27:23,686
I've learnt this stuff in the town by
paying them a fee of 10,000 rupees.

1645
01:27:23,747 --> 01:27:24,996
There won't be any mistakes in this.

1646
01:27:25,486 --> 01:27:26,727
Go and give this to her.

1647
01:27:26,752 --> 01:27:27,758
Final?

1648
01:27:27,783 --> 01:27:28,887
Certainly.

1649
01:27:29,572 --> 01:27:31,080
Why don't take a picture of this
letter and send it on her Whatsapp?

1650
01:27:31,091 --> 01:27:33,051
-I'll hit you with footwear!
-Think about this.

1651
01:27:33,696 --> 01:27:36,689
Uhuh! This is the state
of the friends since ages.

1652
01:27:36,714 --> 01:27:37,914
[phone ringing]

1653
01:27:41,339 --> 01:27:42,491
Phew!

1654
01:27:44,290 --> 01:27:45,969
-Hello Swati.
-Krishnaveni...

1655
01:27:45,994 --> 01:27:47,658
I mean... Krishnaveni!

1656
01:27:48,861 --> 01:27:49,871
-Sorry...
-Sorry, dear!

1657
01:27:52,381 --> 01:27:53,491
What for?

1658
01:27:53,657 --> 01:27:54,848
Belated Happy Birthday!

1659
01:27:54,976 --> 01:27:55,991
Thanks!

1660
01:27:56,016 --> 01:27:59,239
Actually, I was waiting for you.
But that rogue Bujji got me caught.

1661
01:27:59,790 --> 01:28:01,191
-One second.
-Okay.

1662
01:28:02,390 --> 01:28:05,810
Phew!
She still doesn't know that I'm Bujji.

1663
01:28:06,963 --> 01:28:07,586
Yeah, tell me.

1664
01:28:07,744 --> 01:28:10,128
So listen... The investor has
agreed to fund our project.

1665
01:28:10,516 --> 01:28:12,265
He also gave us a new office.

1666
01:28:12,290 --> 01:28:14,924
And my mother has agreed
to send me to Hyderabad.

1667
01:28:15,182 --> 01:28:16,594
-One more second.
-Okay!

1668
01:28:17,716 --> 01:28:18,265
Phew!

1669
01:28:19,846 --> 01:28:22,070
-Tell me
-Why are you taking a gap in between?

1670
01:28:22,208 --> 01:28:23,516
I did not take it. It just came.

1671
01:28:23,541 --> 01:28:26,499
-What?
-Birthday comes once a year.

1672
01:28:26,646 --> 01:28:28,230
I was waiting for you for one full day.

1673
01:28:28,355 --> 01:28:29,816
You should've at least texted me.

1674
01:28:29,916 --> 01:28:31,832
I'm really sorry.
My situation was bad.

1675
01:28:31,932 --> 01:28:33,725
You didn't even have a concern
that I was waiting for you.

1676
01:28:33,736 --> 01:28:34,643
This is too much!

1677
01:28:34,708 --> 01:28:36,566
I swear, I'm really sorry.

1678
01:28:37,744 --> 01:28:38,837
Well... Where are you?

1679
01:28:38,856 --> 01:28:40,097
Where will I be? I am here.

1680
01:28:40,435 --> 01:28:42,654
-Hyderabad?
-Of course, in Hyderabad.

1681
01:28:42,752 --> 01:28:43,832
Did you think that I'd
be in your hometown?

1682
01:28:43,843 --> 01:28:47,994
Okay! I'll start now. We shall meet at
new office tomorrow. I'll message you.

1683
01:28:48,005 --> 01:28:49,552
-Bye!
-Bye.

1684
01:28:51,443 --> 01:28:52,923
[exhales deeply]

1685
01:28:53,242 --> 01:28:56,630
Thank God! It's such a relief!

1686
01:29:00,466 --> 01:29:01,412
Satthi!

1687
01:29:02,413 --> 01:29:04,765
[scoffs] Please don't serve
any tea or coffee to me now.

1688
01:29:05,463 --> 01:29:07,457
-When did you come back from Hyderabad?
-Why did you come here?

1689
01:29:07,482 --> 01:29:08,664
-Bujji...
-What Bujji?

1690
01:29:08,777 --> 01:29:11,433
Bujji asked me to give you this letter
[phone ringing]

1691
01:29:11,969 --> 01:29:12,987
Excuse me.

1692
01:29:13,012 --> 01:29:14,137
It is Bujji...

1693
01:29:14,190 --> 01:29:15,261
Yeah, tell me dude.

1694
01:29:15,286 --> 01:29:17,086
Hey, did you give the letter to her?

1695
01:29:17,226 --> 01:29:18,411
Not yet, it's in my hands.

1696
01:29:18,422 --> 01:29:20,800
Don't give it to her by any
chance. I will be doomed.

1697
01:29:21,705 --> 01:29:22,266
Oh no!

1698
01:29:22,342 --> 01:29:24,793
Fifty percent of the paper is in her hands
and the other fifty percent is in mine.

1699
01:29:24,993 --> 01:29:28,002
Hey! I don't know what will you do,
but don't give her the letter.

1700
01:29:28,104 --> 01:29:30,092
-I'll kill you if you give it to her.
-Okay.

1701
01:29:30,430 --> 01:29:31,783
Unhold it. You are here
to give it to me, right?

1702
01:29:31,822 --> 01:29:33,135
He asked me not to give it to you.

1703
01:29:33,160 --> 01:29:35,236
-Then, why did you come here?
-He asked me to give it to you.

1704
01:29:35,261 --> 01:29:36,744
-Then, give it
-But now, he asked me not to give.

1705
01:29:36,755 --> 01:29:37,951
-What is this letter?
-Leave letter.

1706
01:29:38,051 --> 01:29:39,677
-Why will he send a leave letter to me?
-You are right.

1707
01:29:39,789 --> 01:29:41,641
-It is a love letter.
-Love letter? And for me?

1708
01:29:41,652 --> 01:29:43,137
-No, it's for your mother
-For my mother?

1709
01:29:43,148 --> 01:29:44,015
What's in it?

1710
01:29:44,191 --> 01:29:45,672
He might have written about
your history with him in Hyderabad.

1711
01:29:45,872 --> 01:29:47,831
-We had none.
-He might have written the same.

1712
01:29:47,856 --> 01:29:49,668
Is he trying to somehow prove me bad?

1713
01:29:49,968 --> 01:29:52,797
There's nothing new to prove you as bad.
People are already badmouthing about you.

1714
01:29:53,796 --> 01:29:56,377
-Mommy...
-Hey, stop!

1715
01:29:57,229 --> 01:29:58,524
You are going to die in my hands today.

1716
01:29:58,776 --> 01:30:00,195
-Wait
-Hey...

1717
01:30:05,760 --> 01:30:07,340
-Hey...
-You are not Krishna-Veni.

1718
01:30:07,540 --> 01:30:09,158
-You are a demonic-Veni
-Hey buffalo, stop there!

1719
01:30:10,292 --> 01:30:11,460
Ow!

1720
01:30:15,821 --> 01:30:18,144
[people greeting]

1721
01:30:18,193 --> 01:30:19,129
-Hi, I'm Sweety
-Hi, I'm Rajesh.

1722
01:30:19,158 --> 01:30:19,629
Hi.

1723
01:30:20,115 --> 01:30:22,116
Srinu, our start-up
company is all set to rock.

1724
01:30:22,140 --> 01:30:23,715
Our lives would be settled.

1725
01:30:23,875 --> 01:30:24,897
Hi...

1726
01:30:26,511 --> 01:30:27,695
Krishna...

1727
01:30:29,115 --> 01:30:30,549
-What is this?
-Sweets.

1728
01:30:30,748 --> 01:30:32,188
-Oh!
-Distribute to everyone.

1729
01:30:33,142 --> 01:30:34,896
-Give me one
-Me as well.

1730
01:30:35,111 --> 01:30:36,247
-What is this?
-For me?

1731
01:30:36,381 --> 01:30:37,880
-This is for Srinu
-Woah!

1732
01:30:37,932 --> 01:30:39,032
Special one for Srinu?

1733
01:30:39,043 --> 01:30:40,708
<i>Hey Srinu, she brought
special sweets for you.</i>

1734
01:30:41,549 --> 01:30:42,788
-Give them to everyone
-Hi.

1735
01:30:43,101 --> 01:30:43,961
Hi...

1736
01:30:45,514 --> 01:30:46,877
These are my village sweets.

1737
01:30:48,640 --> 01:30:49,644
Thank you...

1738
01:30:50,012 --> 01:30:51,926
[all]: Thank you...

1739
01:30:56,225 --> 01:30:58,457
-Shall we start?
-Hmm...

1740
01:31:08,409 --> 01:31:09,215
Ah!

1741
01:31:09,384 --> 01:31:10,656
What is this Bujjigadu?

1742
01:31:10,787 --> 01:31:12,795
Exactly! What is Bujjigadu?

1743
01:31:13,045 --> 01:31:15,127
How is Bujji related to our project?
What did we come for?

1744
01:31:15,427 --> 01:31:17,412
This is my project.
I came here for this.

1745
01:31:17,717 --> 01:31:18,795
We are dead!

1746
01:31:18,852 --> 01:31:21,351
You've been into that in the hometown.
And you want to continue it here as well?

1747
01:31:21,376 --> 01:31:22,468
How do you know that?

1748
01:31:22,798 --> 01:31:25,473
Since you've started doing this as
soon as you came here. I thought so.

1749
01:31:25,586 --> 01:31:26,619
What do you say?

1750
01:31:26,886 --> 01:31:28,285
Yeah. I too thought the same.

1751
01:31:28,337 --> 01:31:29,764
Anyhow, good things
happened to you because of Bujji.

1752
01:31:29,868 --> 01:31:31,441
You went back to your parents.
Your marriage got cancelled.

1753
01:31:31,724 --> 01:31:32,452
What else do you need?

1754
01:31:32,552 --> 01:31:34,532
I think Bujji is a very good guy.

1755
01:31:35,818 --> 01:31:37,644
When I asked you on the other day that
if you had fallen in love with any guy,

1756
01:31:37,810 --> 01:31:39,828
you said that you'd have
informed me if you had any.

1757
01:31:40,028 --> 01:31:42,266
I thought you were first hand. But I got
to know that you are a second hand girl.

1758
01:31:42,291 --> 01:31:44,253
What are you talking,
cousin? Have you gone mad?

1759
01:31:44,314 --> 01:31:44,920
Stop it!

1760
01:31:45,277 --> 01:31:46,712
Bujji told me that both of you have done
all the things which a couple would do.

1761
01:31:46,812 --> 01:31:47,939
Don't act like an innocent!

1762
01:31:48,320 --> 01:31:49,581
I'm not a fool!

1763
01:32:02,981 --> 01:32:04,966
He is very astute.
He has deactivated the Facebook account.

1764
01:32:04,977 --> 01:32:05,428
Fools!

1765
01:32:05,515 --> 01:32:07,244
-Let's keep that aside
-What do you mean?

1766
01:32:07,418 --> 01:32:08,141
What?

1767
01:32:08,541 --> 01:32:10,652
Is it right to plan about Bujji
who has been in your hometown?

1768
01:32:10,752 --> 01:32:12,636
He is not in my hometown.
He is in Hyderabad.

1769
01:32:12,736 --> 01:32:13,951
I got the perfect information.

1770
01:32:14,154 --> 01:32:15,167
So?

1771
01:32:15,367 --> 01:32:18,235
An investor has trusted us with
his money. And what are we doing?

1772
01:32:18,435 --> 01:32:21,299
Why did we come here? What is our goal?
What is our target? What's this mess?

1773
01:32:21,599 --> 01:32:23,040
Yes, you are right.

1774
01:32:23,427 --> 01:32:23,879
Thank you.

1775
01:32:24,081 --> 01:32:25,491
-You be on that work.
-Yes.

1776
01:32:25,591 --> 01:32:27,048
Bhadram, Sweety, Hari

1777
01:32:27,163 --> 01:32:28,667
let's work on Operation Bujjigadu.

1778
01:32:29,254 --> 01:32:30,511
-Let's go to our cabin.
-Hey... Hey...

1779
01:32:30,622 --> 01:32:33,315
-Krishnaveni... Krishnaveni, stop...
-Sweety.

1780
01:32:33,621 --> 01:32:35,648
Hey, Bhadram... Hey...

1781
01:32:35,683 --> 01:32:36,640
Bujji and Srinu are the same persons.

1782
01:32:36,704 --> 01:32:39,280
Krishnaveni loves Srinu and
hates Bujji at the same time.

1783
01:32:39,430 --> 01:32:41,950
How will Bujji a.k.a Srinu
come out of this problem?

1784
01:32:42,069 --> 01:32:42,951
<i>Siri: Go ahead.</i>

1785
01:32:43,151 --> 01:32:45,810
He is ruining my life.
Who are you talking to, dude?

1786
01:32:45,821 --> 01:32:48,912
I am talking to Siri, dude.
I'm trying to find a solution.

1787
01:32:49,012 --> 01:32:50,112
<i>Siri: I'm not sure I understand.</i>

1788
01:32:50,264 --> 01:32:52,616
Siri, please try to understand.

1789
01:32:52,776 --> 01:32:53,925
<i>Siri: Did you try again?</i>

1790
01:32:54,284 --> 01:32:56,135
Oh man! It is asking me to
say it from the beginning.

1791
01:32:56,235 --> 01:32:58,939
<i>-Siri: My apologies.</i>
-Siri has no solution as well.

1792
01:32:59,011 --> 01:33:00,671
Mr Bujji, there is
only one solution for this.

1793
01:33:01,883 --> 01:33:03,581
What if we send Bujji to the USA?

1794
01:33:05,454 --> 01:33:06,845
What if we kill Bujji?

1795
01:33:07,620 --> 01:33:09,804
Hey... All those things won't work out.

1796
01:33:10,344 --> 01:33:11,437
Do something.

1797
01:33:11,462 --> 01:33:14,127
Meet her and tell
everything directly to her.

1798
01:33:14,242 --> 01:33:16,650
It is better to be transparent
with the girl you love.

1799
01:33:16,661 --> 01:33:17,947
Of course, I want to be like that.

1800
01:33:18,744 --> 01:33:20,122
But if she gets to know this,

1801
01:33:21,685 --> 01:33:23,205
she will not be in my life.

1802
01:33:25,162 --> 01:33:26,515
I want her for a lifetime.

1803
01:33:30,631 --> 01:33:31,873
What are you doing, Mr Bujji?

1804
01:33:31,898 --> 01:33:33,817
I'm activating Bujji's Facebook account.

1805
01:33:35,559 --> 01:33:40,482
Hey, Krishnaveni has deactivated
her Facebook account.

1806
01:33:40,493 --> 01:33:41,686
Is it?

1807
01:33:42,490 --> 01:33:44,462
-[phone rings]
-Krishnaveni is calling.

1808
01:33:46,185 --> 01:33:47,958
Why did you deactivate
your Facebook account?

1809
01:33:48,195 --> 01:33:49,889
Yeah! How do you know?

1810
01:33:51,193 --> 01:33:53,370
Did you do it?
If not, I wanted you to do it.

1811
01:33:53,381 --> 01:33:53,974
Why?

1812
01:33:54,129 --> 01:33:56,696
Well, he can't be found if you
try it from a new account.

1813
01:33:57,248 --> 01:33:59,542
-We might find him with a new one.
-Exactly!

1814
01:33:59,601 --> 01:34:01,808
I got the same idea,
so I have deactivated the account.

1815
01:34:03,146 --> 01:34:05,622
Anyway, I have deleted him from my brain.

1816
01:34:06,576 --> 01:34:08,257
-Really?
-Okay! Forget all this.

1817
01:34:08,881 --> 01:34:10,243
-Are you free now?
-Totally.

1818
01:34:10,521 --> 01:34:11,834
-Will you come with me?
-Where?

1819
01:34:12,034 --> 01:34:13,236
Oh! Kalakand Aunt's home?

1820
01:34:13,488 --> 01:34:14,649
Shut up and come.

1821
01:34:14,749 --> 01:34:16,024
Aunt...

1822
01:34:17,014 --> 01:34:18,345
Hey, Krishna!

1823
01:34:18,694 --> 01:34:19,833
-How are you?
-I'm fine.

1824
01:34:20,522 --> 01:34:22,798
You are Srinu, right?

1825
01:34:23,063 --> 01:34:24,080
I forgot to tell you.

1826
01:34:24,091 --> 01:34:26,409
Swetha sent a parcel from
America. Go and check it.

1827
01:34:26,427 --> 01:34:28,247
I'll get some coffee in the meantime.

1828
01:34:28,258 --> 01:34:29,378
The parcel is over there.

1829
01:34:33,459 --> 01:34:35,264
Krishna, how is everyone in your hometown?

1830
01:34:35,275 --> 01:34:36,350
They are superb, aunt.

1831
01:34:36,375 --> 01:34:38,375
It's been five years since
I have visited my hometown.

1832
01:34:38,740 --> 01:34:42,521
There was a big tree near the temple
of tribal Goddess. Is it still there?

1833
01:34:42,532 --> 01:34:44,527
No, they have chopped
it during road widening.

1834
01:34:48,287 --> 01:34:49,818
They will chop it if it is
in the middle of the road.

1835
01:34:49,843 --> 01:34:51,466
Anyway,
they aren't sparing trees in these days.

1836
01:34:51,768 --> 01:34:53,568
That's why we don't
have enough oxygen now.

1837
01:34:54,475 --> 01:34:56,704
Do you know how difficult is to
breathe while walking on the roads?

1838
01:34:57,375 --> 01:34:59,695
Hmm... Correct.

1839
01:35:00,852 --> 01:35:02,211
One minute..

1840
01:35:05,661 --> 01:35:06,878
Phew!

1841
01:35:06,903 --> 01:35:09,838
Don't you know how much careful you
should be while playing two characters?

1842
01:35:09,912 --> 01:35:10,343
<i>Umm?</i>

1843
01:35:11,357 --> 01:35:13,382
-Sorry uncle. I didn't see you
-What is this?

1844
01:35:13,839 --> 01:35:15,593
Won't you let me work peacefully?

1845
01:35:15,793 --> 01:35:16,947
-Please work peacefully, uncle.
-Please.

1846
01:35:16,972 --> 01:35:18,251
I will switch on the fan for you.

1847
01:35:19,095 --> 01:35:20,323
No... No... No...

1848
01:35:20,648 --> 01:35:22,704
No! There are only one
and two, but no third one.

1849
01:35:22,815 --> 01:35:25,703
No, sister. Everything is there. I've
enquired in the store and bought them.

1850
01:35:25,759 --> 01:35:26,961
Check it again.

1851
01:35:27,488 --> 01:35:28,610
Hello, madam

1852
01:35:28,786 --> 01:35:31,272
-All the three are in the same book.
-Is it?

1853
01:35:31,297 --> 01:35:33,557
Thank God!
Hi, sir. How are you?

1854
01:35:33,568 --> 01:35:34,886
I am superb. How are you?

1855
01:35:35,086 --> 01:35:35,691
Yeah.

1856
01:35:35,791 --> 01:35:36,718
Have you been meeting, Srujana?

1857
01:35:37,828 --> 01:35:39,253
Hey, baby! How are you?

1858
01:35:39,946 --> 01:35:42,483
Hey Srujju! How are you?
Is everything okay?

1859
01:35:42,527 --> 01:35:45,288
I am okay. I feel weak
when I'm on my period.

1860
01:35:45,299 --> 01:35:47,040
-What is it?
<i>-During my period...</i>

1861
01:35:47,051 --> 01:35:48,508
Can you go over there and
talk with her privately?

1862
01:35:49,249 --> 01:35:50,297
One minute...

1863
01:35:50,497 --> 01:35:52,658
[scoffs]

1864
01:35:59,170 --> 01:36:01,923
I'll talk about me later.
Is Sunday Pillai around?

1865
01:36:01,934 --> 01:36:03,543
<i>-Srujana: Yeah.</i>
-Are you using him?

1866
01:36:03,797 --> 01:36:05,679
<i>No, dude. He is the one who
has been using me in reverse.</i>

1867
01:36:05,689 --> 01:36:07,194
Oh no!
What did you think?

1868
01:36:07,296 --> 01:36:08,943
Did you expect every guy
to be a fool like me?

1869
01:36:14,481 --> 01:36:15,188
Hmph!

1870
01:36:16,875 --> 01:36:17,953
What, baby?

1871
01:36:17,978 --> 01:36:19,902
You took the shirt that I
gave you to America as well?

1872
01:36:19,958 --> 01:36:23,576
<i>Yeah! I feel the pain of
missing you whenever I wear it.</i>

1873
01:36:23,664 --> 01:36:24,563
<i>I miss you so much.</i>

1874
01:36:24,626 --> 01:36:25,678
I miss you too, baby.

1875
01:36:25,878 --> 01:36:27,631
-Srinu, shall we go?
-Give me five minutes.

1876
01:36:28,425 --> 01:36:29,551
Tell me when will you come to Hyderabad.

1877
01:36:29,576 --> 01:36:31,020
Aunt, I'm leaving.

1878
01:36:31,082 --> 01:36:33,302
What? I have prepared food for you.

1879
01:36:33,543 --> 01:36:34,756
I don't want to eat.

1880
01:36:36,504 --> 01:36:37,955
What's wrong, Krishna?

1881
01:36:39,317 --> 01:36:40,514
Nothing.

1882
01:36:40,935 --> 01:36:45,215
[scoffs] When a girl says there's nothing,
it actually means that there's so much.

1883
01:36:45,891 --> 01:36:46,914
I've been observing you.

1884
01:36:46,965 --> 01:36:50,137
Since the time he started to talk
on the phone, your mood has changed.

1885
01:36:50,903 --> 01:36:52,020
Jealousy, right?

1886
01:36:54,758 --> 01:36:57,446
-Or is he talking anything wrong?
-No.

1887
01:36:58,370 --> 01:36:59,434
Then, what is it?

1888
01:37:02,332 --> 01:37:03,500
I don't know, Aunt.

1889
01:37:03,842 --> 01:37:04,961
It is very painful.

1890
01:37:07,443 --> 01:37:10,563
-You like Srinu, right?
-Yeah!

1891
01:37:11,207 --> 01:37:12,386
I like him so much.

1892
01:37:12,795 --> 01:37:14,132
Did you tell him?

1893
01:37:14,754 --> 01:37:16,843
It is that everything got
settled at home very recently.

1894
01:37:16,854 --> 01:37:18,196
I should first talk to my mother about it.

1895
01:37:18,999 --> 01:37:20,196
Then, talk to her.

1896
01:37:20,673 --> 01:37:22,279
Not me.
You should talk to her.

1897
01:37:22,369 --> 01:37:23,855
You should somehow convince her.

1898
01:37:25,160 --> 01:37:26,295
Crazy girl!

1899
01:37:26,381 --> 01:37:29,187
Oh, you have been hiding so much
love for him in your heart?

1900
01:37:30,239 --> 01:37:31,856
Alright! I'll talk to her.

1901
01:37:32,817 --> 01:37:33,904
Thank you!

1902
01:37:34,692 --> 01:37:36,120
Krishnaveni...

1903
01:37:36,295 --> 01:37:39,175
-Shall we leave?
-Yes. Let's go.

1904
01:37:43,425 --> 01:37:44,535
Okay, I'm ready.

1905
01:37:47,055 --> 01:37:48,738
-Shall we leave?
-Where will you go?

1906
01:37:48,937 --> 01:37:50,831
-You should have dinner here. Sit.
-Okay, let's eat.

1907
01:37:53,470 --> 01:37:59,411
[phone ringing]

1908
01:38:01,447 --> 01:38:02,270
Tell me, father.

1909
01:38:02,495 --> 01:38:04,867
You got a good wedding
match from Hyderabad.

1910
01:38:06,043 --> 01:38:07,505
A highly respected man
have arranged this.

1911
01:38:08,168 --> 01:38:09,592
Everything is perfect.

1912
01:38:09,709 --> 01:38:11,224
If you go and meet the girl,

1913
01:38:11,235 --> 01:38:12,887
we can talk about the
rest of the things later.

1914
01:38:12,898 --> 01:38:15,643
I can't go and meet her. I'm very
busy now, father.

1915
01:38:16,237 --> 01:38:16,967
It is not possible.

1916
01:38:17,067 --> 01:38:18,305
Well... We'll do something.

1917
01:38:18,958 --> 01:38:20,958
I will come to your place
along with your mother.

1918
01:38:20,968 --> 01:38:22,395
Then,
all of us shall go and meet the girl.

1919
01:38:22,406 --> 01:38:23,795
-Why?
-Ow!

1920
01:38:23,915 --> 01:38:25,475
You guys don't need to come here.

1921
01:38:25,575 --> 01:38:26,064
Why?

1922
01:38:26,175 --> 01:38:28,322
Well, it is not advisable to travel so
long and come here in this hot temperature

1923
01:38:28,504 --> 01:38:29,648
I will spare some time and meet her.

1924
01:38:29,781 --> 01:38:30,197
Okay.

1925
01:38:30,486 --> 01:38:32,039
Is it about matchmaking?

1926
01:38:32,339 --> 01:38:35,000
-This is the planning of my father.
-Why is this family planning for me then?

1927
01:38:35,382 --> 01:38:37,582
-Stupid
-I'll meet her and reject. It shall work.

1928
01:38:37,901 --> 01:38:39,287
Don't force it so much, darling.

1929
01:38:44,416 --> 01:38:45,924
Blue shirt girl...

1930
01:38:47,999 --> 01:38:48,485
Ow!

1931
01:38:49,774 --> 01:38:51,414
-Careful!
-Thank you, sir.

1932
01:38:55,826 --> 01:38:57,085
Why did she come here?

1933
01:38:59,590 --> 01:39:01,155
Will she feel bad about me if
she sees me with this girl?

1934
01:39:01,842 --> 01:39:03,088
I'd better tell this to her.

1935
01:39:04,190 --> 01:39:05,499
[phone rings]

1936
01:39:05,879 --> 01:39:06,940
Srinu...

1937
01:39:06,965 --> 01:39:08,250
Oh God!

1938
01:39:08,275 --> 01:39:10,917
The way she is whispering
suggests that she is upto something.

1939
01:39:13,059 --> 01:39:13,923
What?

1940
01:39:14,048 --> 01:39:16,136
I've arranged a wedding
match for Bujji with a tramp.

1941
01:39:16,427 --> 01:39:17,664
Oh... What?

1942
01:39:17,919 --> 01:39:18,428
Shh!

1943
01:39:18,628 --> 01:39:20,278
It's for Bujji.
Hey, come with me.

1944
01:39:20,998 --> 01:39:22,208
-Coming.
-Quick.

1945
01:39:22,233 --> 01:39:24,345
Do you even know the meaning of tramp?

1946
01:39:24,356 --> 01:39:26,028
I know everything.
I have arranged this intentionally.

1947
01:39:26,053 --> 01:39:29,397
-Very interesting. Where's the venue?
<i>-Hotel California.</i>

1948
01:39:29,497 --> 01:39:30,834
I'm just beside it. Can I come and join?

1949
01:39:31,250 --> 01:39:32,621
Okay. Come.

1950
01:39:35,638 --> 01:39:37,497
Is she a tramp! To hell with my life!

1951
01:39:40,221 --> 01:39:42,030
-Hi.
-Hi, come sit.

1952
01:39:44,291 --> 01:39:45,365
Did the gentleman you
are looking for, arrive?

1953
01:39:46,184 --> 01:39:48,143
Well... You did say that you removed
Bujji from your brain, didn't you?

1954
01:39:48,280 --> 01:39:49,575
That was yesterday but I have
re-inserted him back today.

1955
01:39:49,586 --> 01:39:52,086
Is this some kind of BP tablet to do so?

1956
01:39:52,097 --> 01:39:53,805
Why are you feeling so bad?

1957
01:39:53,950 --> 01:39:56,496
-Hello, come here.
-Oh! She is calling me.

1958
01:39:56,696 --> 01:39:58,608
-I'm talking to you, come here once
-Us?

1959
01:39:59,321 --> 01:40:00,605
Come... Come.

1960
01:40:00,737 --> 01:40:02,286
Come!

1961
01:40:04,043 --> 01:40:06,623
I have come here by
shutting today's business.

1962
01:40:06,692 --> 01:40:07,812
I came here expecting that

1963
01:40:07,926 --> 01:40:09,919
you'd get my life settled by fixing
my wedding with an innocent guy.

1964
01:40:10,019 --> 01:40:11,381
-But what is this?
-You don't worry.

1965
01:40:11,506 --> 01:40:13,801
Your wedding will be fixed with Bujji
for sure. Your life will be settled.

1966
01:40:14,981 --> 01:40:17,775
-Did you call him after coming here?
-I did. He said he's on the way.

1967
01:40:17,985 --> 01:40:19,530
It's been already an hour.

1968
01:40:20,723 --> 01:40:21,813
One hour?

1969
01:40:22,229 --> 01:40:23,264
Idea!
[phone rings]

1970
01:40:23,289 --> 01:40:24,356
One minute

1971
01:40:25,731 --> 01:40:26,917
Hello...

1972
01:40:26,942 --> 01:40:29,789
No, sir.
Nothing less than 30,000 rupees.

1973
01:40:30,563 --> 01:40:32,803
-One month salary.
-And, you will not find me later.

1974
01:40:32,828 --> 01:40:33,856
I am going to get married within a week.

1975
01:40:33,867 --> 01:40:35,857
So, think about it and call me back.

1976
01:40:35,868 --> 01:40:38,180
And it is 30,000 rupees plus GST.

1977
01:40:40,528 --> 01:40:41,845
Sorry, it was the customer.

1978
01:40:42,250 --> 01:40:43,435
Call Bujji once.

1979
01:40:43,923 --> 01:40:45,035
One second.

1980
01:40:45,643 --> 01:40:47,268
-What?
-I mean...

1981
01:40:47,343 --> 01:40:51,120
Traffic... One hour... Time...

1982
01:40:51,145 --> 01:40:52,721
-Well... Call him.
-Okay.

1983
01:40:55,776 --> 01:40:57,123
I think he has switched-off his phone.

1984
01:40:57,134 --> 01:40:58,227
It is saying 'not reachable'.

1985
01:41:00,104 --> 01:41:01,279
Idea!

1986
01:41:01,846 --> 01:41:03,497
What if we take Bujji's number from her?

1987
01:41:03,508 --> 01:41:05,845
-Then, we will have his number.
-Excellent!

1988
01:41:05,856 --> 01:41:07,585
-Super idea.
-Fantastic idea.

1989
01:41:08,370 --> 01:41:10,791
Amazing! I'll take it from her.

1990
01:41:11,228 --> 01:41:12,411
Note it down.

1991
01:41:14,173 --> 01:41:15,488
-Yes. Got it.
-Noted?

1992
01:41:15,624 --> 01:41:16,975
Yeah.

1993
01:41:17,825 --> 01:41:19,056
[message notification tone]

1994
01:41:19,081 --> 01:41:20,684
I think it is Bujji.

1995
01:41:21,507 --> 01:41:24,480
I am okay with 30,000 rupees
with GST. Please come.

1996
01:41:24,648 --> 01:41:26,424
Sorry, it was a customer.

1997
01:41:26,714 --> 01:41:30,328
Oh ma'am! There are lot of people
waiting for you by holding their works.

1998
01:41:30,383 --> 01:41:31,638
-Please go.

01:41:33,198 --> 01:41:35,078
Call me if you need my service.

-Idea
-Hey... The ideas shouldn't be spontaneous

2001
01:41:41,022 --> 01:41:42,689
If you take some time to think,

2002
01:41:42,700 --> 01:41:44,157
you'll get bigger and strong ideas.

2003
01:41:44,168 --> 01:41:46,461
Listen to me. We'll check
this number in Truecaller app.

2004
01:41:46,554 --> 01:41:49,993
And we can find his photo,
email ID and all his details.

2005
01:41:50,018 --> 01:41:52,260
You smart girl!

2006
01:41:52,658 --> 01:41:54,528
I wonder when you have
developed this clever skills!

2007
01:41:55,059 --> 01:41:57,095
I never thought you
would be so intelligent.

2008
01:41:57,295 --> 01:41:58,330
Tell me his number.

2009
01:41:58,455 --> 01:42:00,976

2020

2013
01:42:13,477 --> 01:42:14,918
Ah!

2014
01:42:18,365 --> 01:42:19,420
This guy?

2015
01:42:22,727 --> 01:42:23,931
Srinu, do you remember him?

2016
01:42:23,942 --> 01:42:25,104
No, I don't remember.

2017
01:42:25,271 --> 01:42:28,213
He travelled with along us in the train
when we met for the first time.

2018
01:42:30,185 --> 01:42:31,900
Oh! Right!

2019
01:42:31,968 --> 01:42:33,451
What a coincidence!

2020
01:42:33,688 --> 01:42:34,694
Yes!

2021
01:42:34,719 --> 01:42:36,075
Now, I got the clear picture.

2022
01:42:36,479 --> 01:42:38,083
I am hundred percent
sure that he is Bujji.

2023
01:42:39,240 --> 01:42:40,685
-This is his number, right?
-Yes.

2024
01:42:41,311 --> 01:42:43,348
-I'll save it.
-Oh my God!

2025
01:42:43,448 --> 01:42:45,284
I'll take you to task, Bujji.

2026
01:42:47,117 --> 01:42:49,524
Bujji, my show starts now

2027
01:42:57,484 --> 01:43:00,121
"Hey, you troublesome
and exasperating girl..."

2028
01:43:00,181 --> 01:43:04,792
"I've been pursuing you and my plan
got ruined. What did I achieve?"

2029
01:43:06,331 --> 01:43:08,931
"I'm an innocent guy"

2030
01:43:08,984 --> 01:43:12,220
"Do not ravage me, Krishnaveni"

head over heels for you"

"Don't try to kill me, Krishnaveni"

2033
01:43:18,392 --> 01:43:21,098
"Krishnaveni... Krishnaveni..."

2034
01:43:21,416 --> 01:43:23,931
"It's all tough with you, Krishnaveni"

2035
01:43:24,042 --> 01:43:27,145
"But I am
head over heels for you, Krishnaveni"

2036
01:43:47,992 --> 01:43:51,482
"I fell in love with you on the day
when I met you on the passenger train"

2037
01:43:54,336 --> 01:43:57,584
"We had good time chatting
on Messenger and Whatsapp"

2038
01:44:00,343 --> 01:44:03,408
"I felt exalted when you've smiled
like the mist of the November month"

2039
01:44:03,419 --> 01:44:06,293
"And I have preserved you in my heart
like the flower of the December month"

2040
01:44:06,393 --> 01:44:10,200
"But you've torn the calender and got
bursted like a cyclinder... Boom!"

2041
01:44:10,946 --> 01:44:13,671
"Krishnaveni... Krishnaveni..."

2042
01:44:13,890 --> 01:44:16,476
"It's all tough with you, Krishnaveni"

2043
01:44:16,678 --> 01:44:19,644
"But I am
head over heels for you, Krishnaveni"

2044
01:44:19,906 --> 01:44:22,773
"Krishnaveni... Krishnaveni..."

2045
01:44:22,860 --> 01:44:25,484
"It's all tough with you, Krishnaveni"

2046
01:44:25,495 --> 01:44:28,831
"But I am
head over heels for you, Krishnaveni"

2047
01:44:46,818 --> 01:44:49,784
"I'm the most remarkable guy in my town"

2048
01:44:51,397 --> 01:44:54,402
"But I became a scapegoat
in your mother's plot"

2049
01:44:55,895 --> 01:44:58,779
"And my father has been misled"

2050
01:44:58,883 --> 01:45:01,610
"As I couldn't understand any of this,
I've been binging on booze"

2051
01:45:01,621 --> 01:45:04,960
"We have been dreaming
together all these days"

2052
01:45:04,971 --> 01:45:07,701
"But today, you've become my nightmare"

2053
01:45:07,712 --> 01:45:10,474
"I'm someone who who can't live
without you even for a moment"

2054
01:45:10,485 --> 01:45:13,678
"But you've been hissing
like a snake on the bed"

2055
01:45:13,689 --> 01:45:16,311
"Krishnaveni... Krishnaveni..."

2056
01:45:16,690 --> 01:45:19,326
"It's all tough with you, Krishnaveni"

2057
01:45:19,337 --> 01:45:22,319
"But I am head over heels
for you, Krishnaveni"

2058
01:45:22,696 --> 01:45:25,375
"Krishnaveni... Krishnaveni..."

2059
01:45:25,675 --> 01:45:28,308
"It's all tough with you, Krishnaveni"
-[phone ringing] Hey, just wait...

2060
01:45:28,453 --> 01:45:30,342
"But I am head over heels for you..."
-Stop it guys...

2061
01:45:30,367 --> 01:45:32,352
-[phone ringing] Master...
-Cut sound...

2062
01:45:32,729 --> 01:45:33,551
Hello.

2063
01:45:33,676 --> 01:45:34,678
I found Bujji.

2064
01:45:36,137 --> 01:45:37,470
Let's meet at office tomorrow.

2065
01:45:37,973 --> 01:45:39,228
What happened?

2066
01:45:39,459 --> 01:45:42,372
-She said she found Bujji, master.
-You are Bujji, right?

2067
01:45:42,730 --> 01:45:45,022
That's what I'm not understanding,
master. I need to go urgently.

2068
01:45:45,164 --> 01:45:45,924
-Please.
-Alright. Go.

2069
01:45:45,949 --> 01:45:47,241
Thank you, master.

2070
01:45:47,366 --> 01:45:49,094
Hey Bujji! All the best!

2071
01:45:51,083 --> 01:45:53,028
Look! The one who is sitting in
the boss's room is Bujji.

2072
01:45:53,641 --> 01:45:54,778
How come he is here?

2073
01:45:54,789 --> 01:45:55,931
He is the brother-in-law of our boss.

2074
01:45:55,953 --> 01:45:57,523
Brother-in-law of our boss?

2075
01:45:57,548 --> 01:45:59,293
So you'll forget about
your revenge on him?

2076
01:45:59,304 --> 01:46:00,724
We will get back to our routine, right?

2077
01:46:00,849 --> 01:46:03,343
We shouldn't spare our enemy
if he is in a higher position than us.

2078
01:46:03,468 --> 01:46:04,501
We have to knock him
down in a deceit manner.

2079
01:46:04,626 --> 01:46:06,042
Srinu, sir is calling you.

2080
01:46:08,991 --> 01:46:13,101
[singing] Hi bro, come on.

2081
01:46:14,496 --> 01:46:19,471
You never imagined that you'd work with
someone you met on the train, right?

2082
01:46:19,789 --> 01:46:20,959
That is called destiny.

2083
01:46:21,481 --> 01:46:23,299
Move... Move...

2084
01:46:28,857 --> 01:46:30,200
It is wrong, isn't it bro?

2085
01:46:30,211 --> 01:46:31,637
What is wrong in that?

2086
01:46:31,703 --> 01:46:33,351
She's been directly looking into my eyes.

2087
01:46:34,683 --> 01:46:36,175
She is in love with me, bro.

2088
01:46:39,129 --> 01:46:40,839
-Are you sure?
-Sure?

2089
01:46:41,170 --> 01:46:42,199
Can't you see it?

2090
01:46:42,224 --> 01:46:45,334
Love, care, feelings and
affection is clearly visible on her eyes.

2091
01:46:45,359 --> 01:46:46,787
All those emotions are for me.

2092
01:46:47,364 --> 01:46:49,191
I'll set this in a week, bro.

2093
01:46:50,011 --> 01:46:51,181
Only one week.

2094
01:46:51,676 --> 01:46:52,949
-One minute...
-Okay.

2095
01:46:53,149 --> 01:46:54,429
One minute...

2096
01:46:57,141 --> 01:46:59,430
He is the apt guy to seek
your revenge. All the best!

2097
01:46:59,564 --> 01:47:00,580
Thank you!

2098
01:47:00,605 --> 01:47:03,640
"The matter is so simple but the
things that are at stake are very big"

2099
01:47:05,090 --> 01:47:08,113
"The life of Bujji has become
confined to the roads"

2100
01:47:09,772 --> 01:47:12,566
"She is the girl of his interest
but she is giving him jitters"

2101
01:47:12,622 --> 01:47:15,434
-"Everything is going upside down for him"
-[groaning in pain]

2102
01:47:15,534 --> 01:47:18,461
"He thought he'd marry her"

2103
01:47:18,661 --> 01:47:21,683
"But she is waiting on the roads
sharpening a knife to end his life"

2104
01:47:21,758 --> 01:47:24,515
"I don't know how much serious this is..."

2105
01:47:24,626 --> 01:47:27,571
"But my life is making me
carry my own dead body"

2106
01:47:27,582 --> 01:47:30,286
-"Krishnaveni... Krishnaveni..."
-Oh my rear is on fire! Fire...

2107
01:47:30,470 --> 01:47:33,265
"It's all tough with you, Krishnaveni"

2108
01:47:33,276 --> 01:47:36,436
"But I am
head over heels for you, Krishnaveni"

2109
01:47:36,523 --> 01:47:39,233
"It's all tough with you, Krishnaveni"

2110
01:47:39,244 --> 01:47:42,291
"But I am
head over heels for you, Krishnaveni"

2111
01:47:42,302 --> 01:47:45,780
-"But I am head over heels for you..."
-Hey... Ow!

2112
01:47:48,263 --> 01:47:54,206
[phone ringing]

2113
01:47:54,350 --> 01:47:54,841
Hello.

2114
01:47:54,873 --> 01:47:57,231
Srinu, my father is here.

2115
01:47:57,531 --> 01:47:58,349
Will you meet him?

2116
01:47:58,521 --> 01:48:00,276
Yeah! Who?

2117
01:48:00,287 --> 01:48:01,306
My father is here.

2118
01:48:01,331 --> 01:48:02,353
No, I can't.

2119
01:48:02,364 --> 01:48:02,938
Why?

2120
01:48:03,108 --> 01:48:04,087
I am suffering from fever.

2121
01:48:04,287 --> 01:48:05,346
Fever?

2122
01:48:05,371 --> 01:48:06,255
Did you go to the hospital?

2123
01:48:06,431 --> 01:48:07,056
Yes.

2124
01:48:07,256 --> 01:48:08,592
Good. Then, come and meet us.

2125
01:48:08,603 --> 01:48:10,541
No, I meant... I must go.

2126
01:48:10,797 --> 01:48:11,557
You'll go now?

2127
01:48:11,718 --> 01:48:13,017
The battery is dying.

2128
01:48:13,067 --> 01:48:17,042
Hello... Hello... Hello... Hel...
Hel... He... He... [disconnects phone]

2129
01:48:25,958 --> 01:48:28,572
I'll leave, dear.

2130
01:48:28,656 --> 01:48:29,951
-Why don't you stay back?
-Ah!

2131
01:48:30,051 --> 01:48:32,332
I meant... stay here for some time
since the train is in the evening.

2132
01:48:32,386 --> 01:48:33,903
-What will you do by going now?
-Well, dear...

2133
01:48:34,203 --> 01:48:38,787
Koteshwar Rao asked me to
handover a gift to his son.

2134
01:48:39,013 --> 01:48:40,094
I've been calling to his mobile but

2135
01:48:40,124 --> 01:48:42,133
it has been busy and
now it is switched off.

2136
01:48:42,433 --> 01:48:44,168
I wonder where that
idiot is hanging around.

2137
01:48:46,226 --> 01:48:47,712
Why is Bujji's picture here?

2138
01:48:47,970 --> 01:48:49,459
Bujji is working here.

2139
01:48:51,570 --> 01:48:52,781
Is it?

2140
01:48:52,806 --> 01:48:54,993
You have lessened my work. Call him.

2141
01:48:55,209 --> 01:48:57,560
We should go to hospital to meet Bujji.

2142
01:48:57,632 --> 01:48:58,765
What happened?

2143
01:48:58,790 --> 01:49:00,587
He met with an accident
yesterday and got hospitalised.

2144
01:49:00,598 --> 01:49:01,939
Oh no! Come, let's go and see him.

2145
01:49:02,039 --> 01:49:03,697
Why, dad?

2146
01:49:03,853 --> 01:49:05,697
We hail from the same village, dear.

2147
01:49:06,298 --> 01:49:09,252
And we don't know if his parents
know about this. Let's go, dear.

2148
01:49:09,351 --> 01:49:11,234
-Come, let's go
-Dad...

2149
01:49:12,415 --> 01:49:15,054
-A guy from my town has been admitted here
-Both of you can't go at a time.

2150
01:49:15,079 --> 01:49:16,234
<i>-Visit him, one by one.
-Okay.</i>

2151
01:49:16,259 --> 01:49:17,844
-Dad, I'll go and tell him.
-Yes, you go.

2152
01:49:22,128 --> 01:49:23,640
Idiot, why did you pull it off?

2153
01:49:23,665 --> 01:49:25,467
It felt nice when you were pulling it.

2154
01:49:27,040 --> 01:49:29,509
Krishnaveni... Krishnaveni...

2155
01:49:29,842 --> 01:49:32,665
You came here to see me?

2156
01:49:32,676 --> 01:49:34,984
I can't believe... I can't believe...

2157
01:49:35,333 --> 01:49:36,913
My father is here to meet you.

2158
01:49:36,924 --> 01:49:39,620
You father came here to meet me?

2159
01:49:39,631 --> 01:49:41,217
You mean father-in-law? [stammers]

2160
01:49:41,310 --> 01:49:43,358
-He told me about some parcel.
-Okay, call him.

2161
01:49:43,535 --> 01:49:44,916
I'll manage something. Call him.

2162
01:49:45,717 --> 01:49:47,333
-She's here.
-You go, dad.

2163
01:49:47,344 --> 01:49:48,605
I'll go.

2164
01:49:51,051 --> 01:49:52,933
Hello, sir. Hello. Here!

2165
01:49:53,306 --> 01:49:55,045
-You are Krishnaveni's father, right?
-Yeah

2166
01:49:55,070 --> 01:49:56,939
Come... Come...
Have a seat... Have a seat.

2167
01:49:57,039 --> 01:49:58,438
Come... Sit here, sir.

2168
01:49:58,727 --> 01:50:00,617
-You got a gift for me?
-It is not for you. Hey!

2169
01:50:00,638 --> 01:50:03,201
Oh no! There are no fruits
or snacks to offer you.

2170
01:50:03,566 --> 01:50:07,113
-Well, sir. Take this Oxygen
-Yuck! It has your Carbondioxide in it.

2171
01:50:07,124 --> 01:50:09,416
-Take it, sir. It is good for health.
-Don't know where he has kept that.

2172
01:50:09,441 --> 01:50:12,196
Inhale this oxygen for
your health benefits.

2173
01:50:13,417 --> 01:50:16,736
Krishnaveni came here
for me... Krishnaveni...

2174
01:50:16,761 --> 01:50:18,162
Hey... Hey...

2175
01:50:18,346 --> 01:50:20,466
-Why are you here?
-Srinu is suffering from fever.

2176
01:50:20,491 --> 01:50:22,524
-Are there no other rooms?
-Are there no other rooms?

2177
01:50:22,549 --> 01:50:24,083
Cost cutting if it is in the same room.

2178
01:50:24,144 --> 01:50:25,800
He's doing favour for the employer.
Do you have any problem?

2179
01:50:25,811 --> 01:50:26,634
Why will I have a problem?

2180
01:50:26,735 --> 01:50:28,765
It'll trim the bill for my brother-in-law
and I will have a company as well.

2181
01:50:28,965 --> 01:50:32,832
-The company is yours, right?
-I was talking about his company with me.

2182
01:50:32,843 --> 01:50:34,127
Oh!

2183
01:50:34,761 --> 01:50:36,286
What do you mean Bujji is not inside, dad?

2184
01:50:36,529 --> 01:50:37,921
There is an crazy guy inside.

2185
01:50:37,993 --> 01:50:39,194
Of course, Bujji is a crazy guy!

2186
01:50:39,804 --> 01:50:41,249
What are you talking, dear?

2187
01:50:42,281 --> 01:50:43,425
Dad, let's check.

2188
01:50:51,737 --> 01:50:53,807
Sir, come on take a puff.

2189
01:50:54,399 --> 01:50:56,583
Damn! Why is this crazy guy behind me?

2190
01:50:56,627 --> 01:50:57,979
Srinu, why are you here?

2191
01:50:57,990 --> 01:50:59,057
Fever.

2192
01:50:59,615 --> 01:51:00,983
This crazy guy's name is Srinu?

2193
01:51:00,994 --> 01:51:02,875
Dad, this is Srinu.

2194
01:51:02,886 --> 01:51:04,464
<i>He works in our office.</i>

2195
01:51:05,068 --> 01:51:06,572
Oh! Hi!

2196
01:51:06,583 --> 01:51:08,586
-All three: Hi!
-Bujji, how are you feeling now?

2197
01:51:08,597 --> 01:51:09,617
Not bad, uncle.

2198
01:51:10,664 --> 01:51:13,493
Since it is a fever,
the doctor advised to talk less.

2199
01:51:13,504 --> 01:51:14,950
Yeah! He told me the same too

2200
01:51:15,046 --> 01:51:16,782
Dad! Talk to Srinu as well.

2201
01:51:17,704 --> 01:51:18,918
Srinu, how are you feeling?

2202
01:51:18,943 --> 01:51:21,029
I feel better now. But the
doctor has to diagnose me again.

2203
01:51:21,040 --> 01:51:24,017
Bro, why is he calling me Srinu?

2204
01:51:24,028 --> 01:51:25,474
No, he's talking to Srinu only.

2205
01:51:25,485 --> 01:51:26,547
No!

2206
01:51:26,672 --> 01:51:28,876
Sir, did you look at
Srinu and called his name?

2207
01:51:29,076 --> 01:51:29,514
Yeah!

2208
01:51:29,743 --> 01:51:30,839
I told you, right?

2209
01:51:30,939 --> 01:51:32,705
Don't go overboard.

2210
01:51:33,776 --> 01:51:34,736
-He was telling that to you.
-No, he was telling you.

2211
01:51:35,022 --> 01:51:36,100
-It was for you.
-It was for you.

2212
01:51:36,194 --> 01:51:37,211
-It was for you.
-It was for you.

2213
01:51:37,311 --> 01:51:39,575
-Bro, whom were you telling that?
-To me... I was telling to myself!

2214
01:51:39,775 --> 01:51:41,796
Srinu, why are you
creating a big scene here?

2215
01:51:42,036 --> 01:51:44,550
I'm observing him since I have
arrived, he's been making a scene.

2216
01:51:44,575 --> 01:51:46,640
Stop it, dad. Srinu would feel bad.

2217
01:51:46,740 --> 01:51:50,080
-When will they leave? I'm tensed.
-How would I know dude?

2218
01:51:50,223 --> 01:51:51,601
Sister...

2219
01:51:51,833 --> 01:51:53,111
When will visiting hours close?

2220
01:51:53,122 --> 01:51:55,135
If there's no one else
coming, I'll close it.

2221
01:51:55,310 --> 01:51:57,050
-There's no one else.
-There's no one else.

2222
01:51:57,076 --> 01:51:58,495
Hey, how can you say that?

2223
01:51:59,042 --> 01:52:00,965
Don't you think I will
not inform this to anyone?

2224
01:52:01,430 --> 01:52:03,291
Bujji, I have called your parents.

2225
01:52:03,386 --> 01:52:05,504
-They might come here anytime
-Did you tell them?

2226
01:52:05,529 --> 01:52:07,534
How could you tell them, sir?
How could you?

2227
01:52:07,545 --> 01:52:08,599
Why? Shouldn't I inform them?

2228
01:52:08,808 --> 01:52:10,277
-What, dear?
-You should of course inform them, dad.

2229
01:52:10,372 --> 01:52:11,421
Why should we hide this matter?

2230
01:52:12,574 --> 01:52:14,236
-Why not?
-[stammers]

2231
01:52:14,261 --> 01:52:15,749
You shouldn't inform
them and that's final.

2232
01:52:16,724 --> 01:52:17,803
You shouldn't inform them.

2233
01:52:18,009 --> 01:52:22,019
Did my parents recommend for my
job at my brother-in-law's office?

2234
01:52:22,126 --> 01:52:23,329
They didn't do that.

2235
01:52:23,764 --> 01:52:26,168
What am I talking and
what is he talking?

2236
01:52:26,884 --> 01:52:28,417
Well... Why is he talking?

2237
01:52:28,568 --> 01:52:29,886
Who is Srinu?
Who is Bujji?

2238
01:52:29,997 --> 01:52:32,554
Sir, pain doesn't
differentiate Bujji or Srinu.

2239
01:52:32,565 --> 01:52:34,761
Pain might be endured
either by Bujji or Srinu.

2240
01:52:34,861 --> 01:52:36,031
But it doesn't mean that
Bujji's pain would be soft and

2241
01:52:36,086 --> 01:52:37,823
Srinu's pain would make a scene, sir.

2242
01:52:38,023 --> 01:52:38,838
-Listen to me...
-Shut up!

2243
01:52:39,264 --> 01:52:40,222
What is all this?

2244
01:52:40,247 --> 01:52:42,101
My husband got a heart
operation done yesterday.

2245
01:52:42,126 --> 01:52:44,350
Who will take responsibility if
something bad happens to him again?

2246
01:52:44,375 --> 01:52:45,177
-[panting] [using asthma inhaler]
-Please go, ma'am.

2247
01:52:45,348 --> 01:52:46,111
You are already out of breath.

2248
01:52:46,311 --> 01:52:48,087
There's a crazy guy here. Please go.

2249
01:52:50,059 --> 01:52:52,530
-Come dear, let's go
-Let's go, dad.

2250
01:52:52,541 --> 01:52:56,062
Uncle, you got some gift for Bujji but
going back without giving it to him... Ow!

2251
01:52:57,583 --> 01:52:58,602
Nice.

2252
01:52:58,627 --> 01:53:00,519
-You have good manners. Give this to Bujji
-Thank you, uncle.

2253
01:53:01,283 --> 01:53:03,776
-To Bujji...
-I should give this to Bujji, right?

2254
01:53:03,801 --> 01:53:04,866
Yeah.

2255
01:53:04,891 --> 01:53:07,436
Bujji, where do you want me to place this?

2256
01:53:07,447 --> 01:53:09,034
-Keep it in the centre
-In the center?

2257
01:53:11,065 --> 01:53:12,298
Why did you place it there?

2258
01:53:12,309 --> 01:53:13,992
It was you who told me to
place it in the centre, right?

2259
01:53:14,245 --> 01:53:16,608
Not here... The other center.

2260
01:53:16,619 --> 01:53:18,312
Oh! The other centre?

2261
01:53:20,722 --> 01:53:22,751
-Yeah
-Why did you place it there?

2262
01:53:22,776 --> 01:53:25,865
I placed it in the centre
since I was told so.

2263
01:53:25,876 --> 01:53:27,204
Center means...

2264
01:53:29,289 --> 01:53:31,061
You said something sensible
for the first time.

2265
01:53:31,202 --> 01:53:32,225
-Yeah.
-Good!

2266
01:53:32,451 --> 01:53:33,313
Thank you, uncle

2267
01:53:33,338 --> 01:53:35,551
[phone rings]

2268
01:53:37,461 --> 01:53:39,078
Hello! Yes, Mr Koteshwar Rao.

2269
01:53:39,121 --> 01:53:40,243
-Ah!
<i>-Oh is it?</i>

2270
01:53:42,274 --> 01:53:45,366
It is Bujji's parents'. They came after
visiting hours and they were stopped.

2271
01:53:46,148 --> 01:53:47,438
Excuse me, sir.

2272
01:53:47,764 --> 01:53:49,322
Please give me the phone

2273
01:53:49,422 --> 01:53:51,009
-Get that.
-Please give me

2274
01:53:52,934 --> 01:53:53,996
Uncle...

2275
01:53:54,419 --> 01:53:56,336
Hello! Give the phone to
the person beside you.

2276
01:53:56,347 --> 01:53:57,750
Talk to him.

2277
01:53:58,095 --> 01:53:59,513
-Sir.
-My parents are here.

2278
01:53:59,772 --> 01:54:02,460
They were stopped citing closure of
visiting hours. Send them inside.

2279
01:54:02,485 --> 01:54:03,748
-Okay, sir. You can go, sir.
-Okay.

2280
01:54:05,037 --> 01:54:06,069
What is this dude?

2281
01:54:06,080 --> 01:54:07,931
<i>-Madhu...</i>
-Don't know if he is killing or helping.

2282
01:54:07,956 --> 01:54:09,860
<i>-Madhu... Hey Madhu...</i>
-Yes.

2283
01:54:10,216 --> 01:54:11,625
Come here.

2284
01:54:11,720 --> 01:54:15,309
Sir, they are not your parents.
Why did you say like that?

2285
01:54:15,597 --> 01:54:17,707
They will send them
only if we talk like that.

2286
01:54:18,925 --> 01:54:20,874
-How was it?
-Too much!

2287
01:54:21,142 --> 01:54:21,723
Einstein.

2288
01:54:21,734 --> 01:54:24,273
Earlier, he was talking nonsense and
now, he claims them to be his parents?

2289
01:54:24,529 --> 01:54:26,053
Maybe he's not mad at them now.

2290
01:54:26,202 --> 01:54:27,887
They are parents at the end of the day.

2291
01:54:28,424 --> 01:54:30,924
-No, dear...
-Krishnaveni, since the parents are coming

2292
01:54:31,262 --> 01:54:33,234
they might object if there
are so many people here.

2293
01:54:33,259 --> 01:54:34,955
If both of you go outside,
they will come inside.

2294
01:54:34,980 --> 01:54:36,736
-Okay
-Let's go, dear.

2295
01:54:37,109 --> 01:54:38,211
Stop!

2296
01:54:38,558 --> 01:54:39,942
Who will object you?

2297
01:54:40,090 --> 01:54:42,052
I am here.
I will take care. Stop there.

2298
01:54:42,186 --> 01:54:43,286
Sir, please calm down.

2299
01:54:43,500 --> 01:54:44,228
Sir, please leave.

2300
01:54:44,398 --> 01:54:45,137
Come, dear.

2301
01:54:45,162 --> 01:54:47,736
Sir, I'll be hurt if you leave.

2302
01:54:48,228 --> 01:54:50,773
I'll break my head with this. Don't go.

2303
01:54:51,421 --> 01:54:53,729
Everyone will have their
own problems. Let them go.

2304
01:54:53,754 --> 01:54:56,364
Calm down, bro. This is my
prestige issue. Don't go, sir.

2305
01:54:56,409 --> 01:54:57,545
I think his madness has aggravated.

2306
01:54:57,582 --> 01:54:58,854
I told you, right?

2307
01:54:59,662 --> 01:55:01,788
But the positive aspect
in his madness is that,

2308
01:55:01,925 --> 01:55:05,042
he says that he would
hurt himself but not us.

2309
01:55:05,053 --> 01:55:06,242
You're right, dad.

2310
01:55:06,253 --> 01:55:08,911
Please kill him. I'll even sell my kidneys
in organ-bank downstairs and pay you.

2311
01:55:08,922 --> 01:55:10,287
I will kill this bugger!

2312
01:55:10,487 --> 01:55:11,487
[heavy breathing]

2313
01:55:18,581 --> 01:55:22,555
-Do something, dude.
-Well, I'll get your parents.

2314
01:55:22,684 --> 01:55:23,701
All of you, wait here.

2315
01:55:23,712 --> 01:55:24,749
Go, get them fast.

2316
01:55:26,485 --> 01:55:28,334
-Madhu...
-Madhu...

2317
01:55:28,534 --> 01:55:29,368
Madhu...

2318
01:55:29,568 --> 01:55:30,457
-What happened?
-Madhu...

2319
01:55:30,482 --> 01:55:33,109
-Wait... Where are you going?
-Bujji...

2320
01:55:33,120 --> 01:55:35,831
Uncle, I'm so much stressed and
tensed about the patient's condition.

2321
01:55:35,842 --> 01:55:36,975
You don't worry, uncle.

2322
01:55:37,070 --> 01:55:38,222
-You sit... Please sit.
-Madhu...

2323
01:55:38,422 --> 01:55:39,651
-Please sit here.
-Madhu, tell me what happened

2324
01:55:39,662 --> 01:55:41,242
You don't worry. Sit here.

2325
01:55:41,489 --> 01:55:43,321
-The patient's condition is very critical
-Madhu.

2326
01:55:44,181 --> 01:55:47,108
Doctor, I'm seeing beautiful
girls when I got to sleep at night.

2327
01:55:47,300 --> 01:55:48,646
But they are vanishing upon waking up.

2328
01:55:48,846 --> 01:55:50,399
What should I do to meet
them directly, doctor?

2329
01:55:50,770 --> 01:55:52,404
-Hey, who are you? What are you talking?
-Okay doctor. I'll do that for sure.

2330
01:55:52,429 --> 01:55:53,031
Are you mad?

2331
01:55:53,202 --> 01:55:55,378
Sister, the doctor just
advised me to maintain a diet.

2332
01:55:55,471 --> 01:55:58,711
What do you recommend,
sprouts or brown rice?

2333
01:55:58,822 --> 01:56:00,203
What do you include in your diet?

2334
01:56:00,214 --> 01:56:01,968
-Uncle, I'll take care of it
-Madhu...

2335
01:56:01,979 --> 01:56:04,307
Do you think if I should eat or fast?

2336
01:56:04,318 --> 01:56:06,305
What is your favourite
restaurent, Minerva or Chutneys?

2337
01:56:07,564 --> 01:56:10,048
We did all what we can do.
But there is no use.

2338
01:56:10,094 --> 01:56:11,580
-Yes, sir.
-There is no use of hiding this anymore.

2339
01:56:11,691 --> 01:56:14,928
-You explain to everyone clearly.
-Sure, sir.

2340
01:56:15,066 --> 01:56:16,187
-What happened?
-Please... Please...

2341
01:56:16,212 --> 01:56:17,523
Doctor...

2342
01:56:17,807 --> 01:56:19,079
Oh God!

2343
01:56:19,179 --> 01:56:20,921
-Madhu...
-Madhu...

2344
01:56:21,121 --> 01:56:22,906
-Madhu...
-What happened to our son?

2345
01:56:23,028 --> 01:56:26,126
What happened to Bujji, Madhu?
Tell me, Madhu.

2346
01:56:26,226 --> 01:56:29,110
Sir, your son is not in that room. He is
in the corner room to your right side.

2347
01:56:29,121 --> 01:56:30,037
Is it?

2348
01:56:30,468 --> 01:56:31,972
He says that our son is not in this room.

2349
01:56:32,226 --> 01:56:35,233
Uncle, I was not worrying
for our Bujji all this while.

2350
01:56:36,262 --> 01:56:37,450
I will kill you!

2351
01:56:37,475 --> 01:56:38,198
Come...

2352
01:56:38,475 --> 01:56:39,409
-Sinister!
-[stammers]

2353
01:56:43,321 --> 01:56:45,112
Bujji, what happened?

2354
01:56:45,297 --> 01:56:46,368
Mr Koteshwar Rao,

2355
01:56:46,393 --> 01:56:48,714
they are conducting some tests
on him. Wait for sometime.

2356
01:56:52,040 --> 01:56:55,371
Sir, there is another guy
in the room. Who is he?

2357
01:56:55,659 --> 01:56:56,759
He is your son's colleague.

2358
01:56:56,770 --> 01:56:58,233
-He is suffering from fever
-Oh sad!

2359
01:56:58,244 --> 01:56:59,382
She is Krishnaveni.
You know her, right?

2360
01:56:59,482 --> 01:57:00,726
Of course, we know her.

2361
01:57:03,884 --> 01:57:05,638
The patient is very weak.

2362
01:57:05,649 --> 01:57:06,878
Don't disturb him.

2363
01:57:06,903 --> 01:57:08,466
Okay.

2364
01:57:09,698 --> 01:57:11,450
Bujji, how are you feeling?

2365
01:57:15,868 --> 01:57:18,130
I'm talking to you.
Why are you not talking?

2366
01:57:18,141 --> 01:57:19,148
Look, sir.

2367
01:57:19,173 --> 01:57:22,700
We came here from so far by taking so
much trouble and he's not talking to us.

2368
01:57:22,725 --> 01:57:24,562
Of course, parents will be complaining.

2369
01:57:24,744 --> 01:57:26,653
But do you need to show your
resentment even at this time, Bujji?

2370
01:57:26,664 --> 01:57:27,685
Yes! Yes!

2371
01:57:28,086 --> 01:57:31,223
Of course, he will vent anger.
Should he hide it or what?

2372
01:57:31,445 --> 01:57:32,961
Zip it, crazy man!

2373
01:57:32,972 --> 01:57:34,875
We have been talking something and
you've been telling us something else.

2374
01:57:34,975 --> 01:57:37,066
What is wrong in what he said, sir?
He was right indeed.

2375
01:57:37,266 --> 01:57:38,649
Why are you talking in the middle?

2376
01:57:39,164 --> 01:57:40,231
He is my son and he'll do
whatever he wants to do.

2377
01:57:40,385 --> 01:57:41,863
What's with your restriction in that?

2378
01:57:42,063 --> 01:57:44,801
Please don't talk harshly to her.
It pains me here.

2379
01:57:44,901 --> 01:57:45,810
Super, brother!

2380
01:57:45,835 --> 01:57:46,915
I was about to say the same
and you have said it out.

2381
01:57:47,156 --> 01:57:48,384
Do you understand at least now?

2382
01:57:48,395 --> 01:57:50,539
You've been pampering
him by showering love.

2383
01:57:50,550 --> 01:57:51,589
Come on, Koteshwar Rao.

2384
01:57:51,703 --> 01:57:54,602
Why are you fighting over the
blabbering of a crazy guy?

2385
01:57:54,613 --> 01:57:56,210
How dare you call me a crazy guy!

2386
01:57:57,212 --> 01:57:59,754
-It is you who is crazy.
-Hey bloody crazy guy!

2387
01:58:01,671 --> 01:58:04,335
-Krishnaveni.
-I'll kill you!

2388
01:58:04,502 --> 01:58:05,830
Die... Die... Die...
Die... Die... Die...

2389
01:58:06,030 --> 01:58:06,570
Krishnaveni.

2390
01:58:06,770 --> 01:58:08,252
-Die... Die... Die...
-Ow! Ouch!

2391
01:58:08,324 --> 01:58:09,973
Hey Madhu...

2392
01:58:09,984 --> 01:58:11,781
-Die... Die...
-He's killing me

2393
01:58:11,792 --> 01:58:13,038
What happened?

2394
01:58:13,049 --> 01:58:14,204
Stop this.

2395
01:58:14,592 --> 01:58:16,144
I have stopped!

2396
01:58:17,086 --> 01:58:19,600
<i>Srinu: I asked you stop this mess,
not the power supply.</i>

2397
01:58:20,267 --> 01:58:20,870
Oh no!

2398
01:58:21,856 --> 01:58:23,259
-Krishnaveni...
-There are CC cameras here

2399
01:58:23,292 --> 01:58:24,998
-Escape from here.
-What about you, dad?

2400
01:58:25,088 --> 01:58:27,986
It's okay even if I go to jail for three
years but he shouldn't be alive.

2401
01:58:28,011 --> 01:58:30,230
Leave, dear. Leave...

2402
01:58:34,247 --> 01:58:36,001
Hoe dare you to hit me?

2403
01:58:36,012 --> 01:58:37,841
What do you think of me?

2404
01:58:37,852 --> 01:58:40,086
If I lose my mind,
I will take everyone to task!

2405
01:58:40,606 --> 01:58:42,095
[electricity buzzes]
Oh God! Run...

2406
01:58:43,786 --> 01:58:45,277
Run... Run...

2407
01:58:45,375 --> 01:58:47,159
-What about, Srinu?
I'll take care.

2408
01:59:03,706 --> 01:59:05,472
-Sai, see you.
-Okay, sir.

2409
01:59:06,314 --> 01:59:08,967
Son, you're getting late to the work.
Go to your office. We'll leave.

2410
01:59:09,167 --> 01:59:09,595
Okay.

2411
01:59:09,970 --> 01:59:11,020
-Bye, son.
-Come.

2412
01:59:11,497 --> 01:59:13,754
-Call me once you reach.
-Okay.

2413
01:59:14,086 --> 01:59:16,415
[phone rings]

2414
01:59:17,112 --> 01:59:18,129
Hello.

2415
01:59:18,154 --> 01:59:19,718
I'm on my way to office.

2416
01:59:19,729 --> 01:59:21,176
Do you want me to pick you up?

2417
01:59:21,201 --> 01:59:23,318
I have to meet the general
secretary in the secretariat.

2418
01:59:23,329 --> 01:59:24,589
My dad gave me some work.

2419
01:59:24,924 --> 01:59:25,973
You go ahead.
I'll come directly.

2420
01:59:28,792 --> 01:59:29,904
Drive.

2421
01:59:29,929 --> 01:59:31,669
Well... Mr Bujji...

2422
01:59:31,860 --> 01:59:33,198
There is already
booking for the cab.

2423
01:59:34,054 --> 01:59:36,054
You are too much hoggish.

2424
01:59:37,745 --> 01:59:38,803
Hello, excuse me.

2425
01:59:39,419 --> 01:59:40,720
I did not book a share-ride.

2426
01:59:42,261 --> 01:59:44,669
Sir, he's my friend. He'll get down on
the way. You sit back comfortably

2427
01:59:44,803 --> 01:59:46,145
It's okay.

2428
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:49,156
Sorry, sir.

2429
01:59:49,181 --> 01:59:50,137
He's my friend.

2430
01:59:50,162 --> 01:59:51,267
He'll get down on the way.

2431
01:59:51,373 --> 01:59:53,452
He'll get down before the
completion of my ride, right?

2432
01:59:54,010 --> 01:59:57,114
No, sir. You will be the one to
get down first and later, him.

2433
01:59:57,273 --> 01:59:59,664
What is this?
Am I the one who booked the cab or him?

2434
01:59:59,739 --> 02:00:03,031
-That is..
-[coughs]

2435
02:00:04,594 --> 02:00:05,668
Thanks, bro.

2436
02:00:06,703 --> 02:00:09,109
-Hi, bro. This is Gautham.
-Hi.

2437
02:00:09,760 --> 02:00:11,952
Hi, I am Sai... Pammi Sai.

2438
02:00:12,208 --> 02:00:13,488
Mr Sai, please concentrate on the road.

2439
02:00:15,212 --> 02:00:17,329
I'm meeting a girl in a coffee shop for
the first time as a part of matchmaking.

2440
02:00:17,340 --> 02:00:18,629
Oh! All the best, bro.

2441
02:00:18,712 --> 02:00:20,964
It is alright that it is your
first time. What about the girl, sir?

2442
02:00:21,164 --> 02:00:23,337
-Mr Sai, shut up!
-Bye, bro.

2443
02:00:23,361 --> 02:00:23,962
-Bye.
-Thank you

2444
02:00:24,062 --> 02:00:24,608
Thank you sir

2445
02:00:27,446 --> 02:00:28,717
[honks]

2446
02:00:32,266 --> 02:00:34,348
Oh no! He forgot his purse.

2447
02:00:35,211 --> 02:00:36,595
I'll go and give this to him, Mr Bujji.

2448
02:00:37,661 --> 02:00:40,840
[honks] Maybe he didn't finish his morning
chores at his home. He is in a rush.

2449
02:00:41,392 --> 02:00:43,159
Damn! That idiot is relentless!

2450
02:00:43,261 --> 02:00:44,876
-Give the wallet. I'll go and give it.
-Okay, Mr Bujji.

2451
02:00:49,875 --> 02:00:51,321
My dad does things like this all the time.

2452
02:00:54,047 --> 02:00:56,020
-No, I didn't have any plans.
-Bro...

2453
02:00:56,278 --> 02:00:58,557
-I have few ideas...
-You forgot this in the cab.

2454
02:00:58,672 --> 02:00:59,861
Thank you so much, bro.

2455
02:00:59,986 --> 02:01:01,404
And by the way, she's the bride.

2456
02:01:07,217 --> 02:01:08,499
I know her very well.

2457
02:01:08,510 --> 02:01:10,579
-She works in our office.
-Srinu, the thing is that...

2458
02:01:10,767 --> 02:01:12,139
I know that the world is small.

2459
02:01:12,264 --> 02:01:14,074
But never thought
it is this small.

2460
02:01:14,457 --> 02:01:15,723
Your dress is very nice, madam.

2461
02:01:15,989 --> 02:01:18,117
Looks like you wore this
specially for matchmaking.

2462
02:01:20,867 --> 02:01:22,130
Bro, please sit.

2463
02:01:22,141 --> 02:01:23,516
-Coffee?
-No, bro.

2464
02:01:23,541 --> 02:01:25,901
I have a meeting with the general
secretary in the secretariat.

2465
02:01:26,135 --> 02:01:27,052
My daddy asked me to attend it.

2466
02:01:27,252 --> 02:01:28,546
-I'll go.
-Bye.

2467
02:01:28,571 --> 02:01:29,949
Nice dress, madam.

2468
02:01:30,938 --> 02:01:32,200
[doorbell dings]

2469
02:01:34,327 --> 02:01:36,382
Krishnaveni... Why did you
come here at this time?

2470
02:01:36,837 --> 02:01:39,196
Srinu's phone is
still switched off. Where is he?

2471
02:01:39,207 --> 02:01:42,095
I don't know where he is.
Anything urgent?

2472
02:01:42,106 --> 02:01:43,264
There was a small misunderstanding.

2473
02:01:43,383 --> 02:01:45,076
Ask him to call me whenever he
comes home regardless of the time.

2474
02:01:45,087 --> 02:01:46,271
Sure, I'll tell him.

2475
02:01:47,191 --> 02:01:48,578
It is about to rain.
Do you want me to drop you?

2476
02:01:48,589 --> 02:01:49,866
No, the cab is waiting for me.

2477
02:01:50,650 --> 02:01:51,745
-Okay
-Bye.

2478
02:01:51,770 --> 02:01:52,925
Bye. Go safe.

2479
02:02:04,173 --> 02:02:10,022
[music mutes voice]

2480
02:02:10,650 --> 02:02:11,898
So that is the basic...

2481
02:02:11,923 --> 02:02:13,424
You'll think however you want?

2482
02:02:14,408 --> 02:02:15,848
I'm in a important meeting

2483
02:02:15,859 --> 02:02:17,356
-Later...
-This is more important

2484
02:02:17,381 --> 02:02:18,819
Listen to me and understand

2485
02:02:18,830 --> 02:02:20,328
You are not trying to understand me.

2486
02:02:20,567 --> 02:02:22,486
What's happening here?

2487
02:02:22,918 --> 02:02:25,757
-Actually...
-I am head over heels for you.

2488
02:02:28,667 --> 02:02:30,515
Oh, she's proposing her love?

2489
02:02:30,714 --> 02:02:32,155
Guys, let's take a break.

2490
02:02:38,603 --> 02:02:40,186
How can think that
everything you see is true?

2491
02:02:40,315 --> 02:02:41,748
Doesn't your heart
know about me?

2492
02:02:42,482 --> 02:02:44,178
Back at my home, I promised my mom that

2493
02:02:44,720 --> 02:02:45,968
I would abide by her
decision regarding my wedding.

2494
02:02:46,168 --> 02:02:47,350
It was the wedding match
that was sent by her.

2495
02:02:47,643 --> 02:02:49,767
I didn't tell you about the match
because I would anyway reject it.

2496
02:02:50,558 --> 02:02:52,111
You have looked at me
as if I am a cheater.

2497
02:02:52,122 --> 02:02:54,270
I've been so much dejected
since yesterday's morning.

2498
02:02:54,769 --> 02:02:57,147
Can't you get it clarified
by making a phone call?

2499
02:02:57,158 --> 02:02:57,867
Why will you do that?

2500
02:02:58,908 --> 02:03:01,293
You'll have trust on someone
only if you feel they are yours.

2501
02:03:02,182 --> 02:03:02,742
Hmph!

2502
02:03:03,728 --> 02:03:05,357
You are mine.

2503
02:03:08,733 --> 02:03:09,983
You are mine.

2504
02:03:11,189 --> 02:03:12,414
I'm saying this heartfully.

2505
02:03:22,236 --> 02:03:23,261
Congratulations!

2506
02:03:23,272 --> 02:03:24,392
-All the best.
-Thank you.

2507
02:03:25,595 --> 02:03:27,863
Srinu, I can't take this tension anymore.

2508
02:03:27,904 --> 02:03:30,226
I'll call my parents
and you call yours.

2509
02:03:30,793 --> 02:03:32,680
-Let's have a meeting and convince them.
-Okay.

2510
02:03:36,126 --> 02:03:39,318
Dude, Krishnaveni has started.
She might come here anytime

2511
02:03:39,421 --> 02:03:40,884
I came her long ago.

2512
02:03:41,868 --> 02:03:43,329
Oh! Late news?

2513
02:03:43,648 --> 02:03:44,670
What are you doing?

2514
02:03:44,695 --> 02:03:46,515
We planned to arrange a
meeting for our parents.

2515
02:03:46,540 --> 02:03:48,873
Really? Then, whose parents
are you going to call?

2516
02:03:48,884 --> 02:03:50,302
Your parents or Bujji's?

2517
02:03:51,270 --> 02:03:52,736
Oh! There is a hitch here, right?

2518
02:03:54,939 --> 02:03:56,939
I'll go to her right away
and tell that I'm Bujji.

2519
02:03:57,130 --> 02:03:59,673
For the first time, you took a
right decision at the right time.

2520
02:03:59,869 --> 02:04:01,150
All the best.

2521
02:04:01,897 --> 02:04:03,953
[phone rings]

2522
02:04:05,259 --> 02:04:06,797
I was about to call you, father.

2523
02:04:06,808 --> 02:04:08,490
Are you missing me, son?

2524
02:04:09,004 --> 02:04:09,547
Yeah, father.

2525
02:04:09,711 --> 02:04:11,408
I am missing you as well.

2526
02:04:11,923 --> 02:04:14,334
Son, there is a good news for you.

2527
02:04:14,359 --> 02:04:14,999
What is it, father?

2528
02:04:15,108 --> 02:04:16,467
We have been breeding a country
chicken at our home, right?

2529
02:04:16,675 --> 02:04:17,087
Yes.

2530
02:04:17,287 --> 02:04:19,085
-We got it butchered.
<i>-Is it?</i>

2531
02:04:19,285 --> 02:04:20,898
And we have prepared
delicious Biryani with that.

2532
02:04:20,998 --> 02:04:22,496
Superb, father!
But what's the occassion?

2533
02:04:22,615 --> 02:04:25,011
We booked a case against Chamundeshwari.

2534
02:04:26,939 --> 02:04:28,079
Why, father?

2535
02:04:28,090 --> 02:04:31,247
How could she six contracts to
the same person consecutively?

2536
02:04:31,473 --> 02:04:33,473
They have set up an enquiry
committee to probe.

2537
02:04:33,620 --> 02:04:35,192
If this gets proved,

2538
02:04:35,392 --> 02:04:36,427
she'll get suspended.

2539
02:04:36,484 --> 02:04:38,397
There is also a chance
that she might go to jail.

2540
02:04:38,517 --> 02:04:39,982
Celebrations starts!

2541
02:04:39,993 --> 02:04:41,745
No one knows that you are the part of
the team who filed that case, right?

2542
02:04:41,845 --> 02:04:43,845
I'm not in the team, son.

2543
02:04:45,564 --> 02:04:47,981
I am the head of the team.

2544
02:04:49,009 --> 02:04:51,303
Everyone in the town knows about this.

2545
02:04:51,314 --> 02:04:53,785
And I've been calling and informing
those who doesn't know about this.

2546
02:04:53,796 --> 02:04:54,806
See you, son.

2547
02:04:54,817 --> 02:04:56,268
There are several people
who I should pass this news.

2548
02:04:58,861 --> 02:04:59,908
What happened?

2549
02:05:03,916 --> 02:05:05,242
What a timing, dude!

2550
02:05:05,253 --> 02:05:08,146
When your luck bags a bronze
medal, your ill-fate is getting gold.

2551
02:05:09,173 --> 02:05:11,056
I wonder if she knows about this news.

2552
02:05:11,409 --> 02:05:13,992
There's no sound yet.
So I don't think she knows it.

2553
02:05:16,954 --> 02:05:18,214
<i>Krishnaveni: Srinu...</i>

2554
02:05:20,341 --> 02:05:22,052
-All the best.
<i>-Srinu...</i>

2555
02:05:22,642 --> 02:05:25,798
Srinu, Bujji's father has filed
a complaint against my mother.

2556
02:05:25,964 --> 02:05:29,175
She has been temporarily suspended and
an inquiry commission has been set up.

2557
02:05:29,375 --> 02:05:30,354
[tyres screech]

2558
02:05:34,587 --> 02:05:36,589
How come you have arrived
without any information?

2559
02:05:37,044 --> 02:05:38,517
Hey, I'm talking to you.

2560
02:05:39,289 --> 02:05:40,383
Shall I get you a cup of coffee?

2561
02:05:44,193 --> 02:05:44,999
[phone rings]

2562
02:05:46,103 --> 02:05:46,627
Tell me.

2563
02:05:46,638 --> 02:05:48,861
Everyone is on the line.
I'm connecting the video call.

2564
02:05:48,886 --> 02:05:50,221
Okay.

2565
02:05:51,634 --> 02:05:53,202
<i>Bujji, can you hear me?</i>

2566
02:05:53,986 --> 02:05:56,271
<i>This is Satya with a selfie camera.</i>

2567
02:05:57,204 --> 02:05:59,486
<i>We are now at attendar Ramaswamy's house.</i>

2568
02:05:59,967 --> 02:06:03,604
<i>He is upset because of the
allegations made against his madam.</i>

2569
02:06:03,715 --> 02:06:05,791
<i>I'll kick you.
Say it properly</i>

2570
02:06:05,802 --> 02:06:07,196
<i>He is a genuine person.</i>

2571
02:06:07,388 --> 02:06:09,708
<i>He is nowhere related
to those allegations.</i>

2572
02:06:09,930 --> 02:06:11,345
<i>He is so innocent that</i>

2573
02:06:11,542 --> 02:06:13,958
<i>he drinks alcohol without diluting
water in it citing contamination.</i>

2574
02:06:14,058 --> 02:06:14,900
<i>Over to Gangaraju</i>

2575
02:06:14,911 --> 02:06:18,451
<i>Chamundeshwari and the president of
the society bank are not on good terms.</i>

2576
02:06:18,640 --> 02:06:20,705
<i>But the news is that he is
no way connected to this.</i>

2577
02:06:21,249 --> 02:06:24,197
We don't we have any source.
What should we do?

2578
02:06:25,145 --> 02:06:26,497
Why is no one talking?

2579
02:06:26,508 --> 02:06:28,935
<i>Your father is behind you...
Your father is behind you!</i>

2580
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:30,760
<i>-Your father</i>
-What are you doing?

2581
02:06:31,944 --> 02:06:33,875
I'm making TikTok videos with friends.

2582
02:06:33,906 --> 02:06:36,119
Are you doing TikTok
videos or something else?

2583
02:06:36,130 --> 02:06:38,459
You would do something and get everyone
of us in trouble, all the time.

2584
02:06:38,470 --> 02:06:39,766
That is what you do, right?

2585
02:06:39,966 --> 02:06:40,966
[phone ringing]

2586
02:06:41,814 --> 02:06:43,259
-Is it him again?
-Yes.

2587
02:06:43,611 --> 02:06:46,767
Why do you get into all the unnecessary
issues? [phone ringing continuously]

2588
02:06:47,845 --> 02:06:49,781
-What happened?
-Swamy Naidu is calling.

2589
02:06:50,330 --> 02:06:53,252
He has been intimidating your
father on the phone since yesterday...

2590
02:06:53,352 --> 02:06:54,426
...to withdraw the case.

2591
02:06:55,059 --> 02:06:56,281
Switch on the speaker.

2592
02:06:56,460 --> 02:06:57,673
What's with you Koteshwar Rao?

2593
02:06:57,684 --> 02:06:58,945
Are you goofing around?

2594
02:06:59,128 --> 02:07:01,049
-I've been observing you since yesterday
-That's not the case, sir.

2595
02:07:01,142 --> 02:07:02,223
Don't give excuses.

2596
02:07:02,495 --> 02:07:05,600
I don't have time to listen
to all your nonsense.

2597
02:07:05,611 --> 02:07:07,192
<i>Withdraw the case immediately.</i>

2598
02:07:07,292 --> 02:07:10,396
Else, my men will come to you
and worsen your situation.

2599
02:07:10,773 --> 02:07:12,792
Got it?
Think about it.

2600
02:07:16,509 --> 02:07:17,643
Where does Swamy Naidu stay?

2601
02:07:31,730 --> 02:07:33,016
-Hello
-Mr Koteshwar Rao.

2602
02:07:33,027 --> 02:07:34,256
Where are you going along with your son?

2603
02:07:34,267 --> 02:07:38,474
Swamy Naidu has threatened unaware
of the fact that my son is a tiger.

2604
02:07:38,632 --> 02:07:39,727
Will he spare him?

2605
02:07:40,293 --> 02:07:41,662
He will finish him today.

2606
02:07:43,354 --> 02:07:45,419
-Sir, forget about my father.
-Oh God!

2607
02:07:46,067 --> 02:07:49,005
She's a sincere officer, sir.
It will ruin her career.

2608
02:07:49,232 --> 02:07:51,654
Tell me how did you know get to know
the details of the tender. Please, sir.

2609
02:07:52,030 --> 02:07:54,364
How did submit the tender with a mere
difference of 1000 to 2000 rupees?

2610
02:07:54,450 --> 02:07:55,656
Please tell me, sir.

2611
02:07:55,860 --> 02:07:57,807
What should I tell you? Bugger off!

2612
02:07:58,104 --> 02:07:59,315
Puny youngster!

2613
02:08:00,367 --> 02:08:02,187
What are you staring at? Get to the work.

2614
02:08:02,198 --> 02:08:03,453
Okay, master.

2615
02:08:07,150 --> 02:08:07,925
[clatters]

2616
02:08:11,448 --> 02:08:14,907
Swamy Naidu...
How did you get to know the details?

2617
02:08:15,086 --> 02:08:19,414
Hey guys! Why the hell are you minding
your work when he is going overboard here?

2618
02:08:19,796 --> 02:08:21,409
Come and handle him.

2619
02:08:22,683 --> 02:08:24,234
Son, let's go back.

2620
02:08:24,693 --> 02:08:26,443
They are like elephants.

2621
02:08:26,454 --> 02:08:27,826
And you look like a filament

2622
02:08:33,938 --> 02:08:34,831
[groans]

2623
02:08:38,254 --> 02:08:41,566
Sir. Please tell me how did
you get to know the details.

2624
02:08:42,135 --> 02:08:43,045
Please, sir...

2625
02:08:47,430 --> 02:08:49,519
[glass shatters]

2626
02:09:04,056 --> 02:09:06,776
Please wait, uncle.
I'm talking here, right?

2627
02:09:08,236 --> 02:09:11,517
Sir. Please tell me how did
you get to know the details.

2628
02:09:15,072 --> 02:09:16,686
[groans]

2629
02:09:19,419 --> 02:09:21,053
Hey!

2630
02:09:22,478 --> 02:09:24,032
Hey!

2631
02:09:27,607 --> 02:09:28,164
[groans]

2632
02:09:29,222 --> 02:09:29,777
Hey!

2633
02:09:31,108 --> 02:09:31,628
Hey!

2634
02:09:31,800 --> 02:09:32,583
Hey!

2635
02:09:33,972 --> 02:09:34,475
Hey!

2636
02:09:38,068 --> 02:09:38,532
Hey!

2637
02:09:39,376 --> 02:09:40,095
Hey!

2638
02:09:40,152 --> 02:09:42,788
Hey... I'll break your head.

2639
02:09:42,896 --> 02:09:45,259
How dare you to show your rowdyism
in front of me? Listen to me...

2640
02:09:45,306 --> 02:09:47,726
I bribed Chamundeshwari
and she leaked it.

2641
02:09:47,751 --> 02:09:48,902
Go and ask her.

2642
02:09:48,927 --> 02:09:51,467
I'll shoot you if you try
to do anything smart here.

2643
02:09:51,478 --> 02:09:52,633
-Mind it!
-Sir... Sir...

2644
02:09:53,730 --> 02:09:55,052
He is an idiot, sir.

2645
02:09:55,063 --> 02:09:56,074
He doesn't know anything.

2646
02:09:56,085 --> 02:09:57,114
You are a gentleman, sir.

2647
02:09:57,214 --> 02:09:58,387
He is a dog, sir.

2648
02:09:58,587 --> 02:09:59,708
Why do you mess with him, sir?

2649
02:09:59,908 --> 02:10:04,090
-Please, come, sir...
-Mind it, idiot!

2650
02:10:08,941 --> 02:10:11,187
What are you thinking
when he told you directly?

2651
02:10:11,673 --> 02:10:13,915
Chamundeshwari got bribed
and leaked the quotation.

2652
02:10:13,926 --> 02:10:15,179
She's not such a lady.

2653
02:10:15,190 --> 02:10:16,848
As if she's so pure!

2654
02:10:16,948 --> 02:10:19,818
-Not to commit any mistake...
-Babu has the video with proof.

2655
02:10:20,018 --> 02:10:21,182
-Hey!
-Bujji!

2656
02:10:26,798 --> 02:10:28,515
Hey...
Why are you not picking up my calls?

2657
02:10:29,127 --> 02:10:31,438
If so,
would you come directly to home?

2658
02:10:31,804 --> 02:10:33,775
However, I called you so many times.
Did you take them?

2659
02:10:33,975 --> 02:10:35,618
Don't show me your ego now!

2660
02:10:35,992 --> 02:10:37,475
We've installed a camera in
Chamundeshwari's cabin, didn't we?

2661
02:10:37,584 --> 02:10:38,365
Do you have its footage?

2662
02:10:38,565 --> 02:10:39,951
-How much do you want?
-How much do you have?

2663
02:10:40,151 --> 02:10:41,422
How much ever you want!

2664
02:10:41,622 --> 02:10:44,849
It's running from the time you
asked me to install it.

2665
02:10:44,860 --> 02:10:46,424
Look here.
Take it if you want.

2666
02:10:46,624 --> 02:10:47,586
He is overacting!

2667
02:10:47,734 --> 02:10:48,172
See!

2668
02:10:48,249 --> 02:10:48,886
Hmm.

2669
02:10:57,908 --> 02:10:59,048
Did anyone see this video?

2670
02:10:59,073 --> 02:11:01,411
Swamy Naidu's brother-in-law
watched it and took the footage.

2671
02:11:01,436 --> 02:11:02,685
How can you give him like that?

2672
02:11:11,884 --> 02:11:13,147
Do you want to say something?

2673
02:11:17,604 --> 02:11:18,964
If you stay silent,

2674
02:11:19,064 --> 02:11:20,402
considering that you've
committed the crime,

2675
02:11:20,496 --> 02:11:21,893
we will have to take you into custody.

2676
02:11:23,268 --> 02:11:27,195
Excuse me,
would you take her into custody?

2677
02:11:27,395 --> 02:11:29,220
On what grounds would you
take her into custody?

2678
02:11:29,420 --> 02:11:31,379
Many roads and schools

2679
02:11:31,560 --> 02:11:33,103
have been constructed in all the
villages surrounding this town.

2680
02:11:33,576 --> 02:11:34,951
Who is the reason behind it?

2681
02:11:34,976 --> 02:11:35,961
It's because of her.

2682
02:11:36,852 --> 02:11:38,801
We won't tolerate if Koteshwar
Rao is trying to frame us

2683
02:11:39,031 --> 02:11:40,149
by keeping personal disputes in his mind.

2684
02:11:40,249 --> 02:11:43,319
Inspector sir, please, clear everything.
We must take her into custody.

2685
02:11:46,768 --> 02:11:49,184
Excuse me.
I need to talk for a minute.

2686
02:11:49,284 --> 02:11:50,048
Yes, proceed.

2687
02:11:51,047 --> 02:11:52,146
One year ago,

2688
02:11:52,702 --> 02:11:56,779
Koteswar Rao's son, Bujji ran away
from this village because of a reason.

2689
02:11:57,137 --> 02:11:58,235
And on the same day,

2690
02:11:58,260 --> 02:12:02,760
Chamundeshwari's daughter
Krishnaveni too ran away from her house.

2691
02:12:03,712 --> 02:12:06,919
They got the tenders not
because Chamundeshwari leaked it,

2692
02:12:07,830 --> 02:12:09,321
but it's because of the video camera
footage which was installed by Bujji.

2693
02:12:09,521 --> 02:12:13,738
It has all the proofs related to it.

2694
02:12:30,698 --> 02:12:31,515
Madam, here are the files.

2695
02:12:33,065 --> 02:12:34,092
Okay, you may go.

2696
02:12:34,151 --> 02:12:34,698
Okay, madam.

2697
02:12:35,508 --> 02:12:36,647
You are correct.

2698
02:12:36,955 --> 02:12:39,543
As you said,
Chamundeshwari is there.

2699
02:12:39,643 --> 02:12:40,653
Her daughter is there.

2700
02:12:40,727 --> 02:12:42,062
Koteshwar Rao is also there.

2701
02:12:42,262 --> 02:12:43,895
The one who placed the
camera is also there.

2702
02:12:43,995 --> 02:12:47,328
But where is the culprit,
Bujji who's behind all of this?

2703
02:12:47,553 --> 02:12:48,230
Hey!

2704
02:12:49,173 --> 02:12:51,843
Why did you come here
and what are you talking?

2705
02:12:51,847 --> 02:12:52,603
You please, wait.

2706
02:12:59,572 --> 02:13:01,501
Sir, I am that Bujji.

2707
02:13:19,730 --> 02:13:22,537
We are cancelling all the tenders
that they got in this wrong process.

2708
02:13:24,808 --> 02:13:28,467
We are giving a clean chit to the
sincere officer Chamundeshwari.

2709
02:13:28,804 --> 02:13:30,895
Inspector, take him into custody.

2710
02:14:09,843 --> 02:14:13,381
It's not like I was betrayed but
it feels like I lost my life.

2711
02:14:15,530 --> 02:14:16,643
That's not the case, Krishnaveni.

2712
02:14:21,293 --> 02:14:24,651
[weeping]

2713
02:14:33,198 --> 02:14:33,954
Hmm!

2714
02:14:35,218 --> 02:14:37,857
Gautam called me.
What do you want me to say?

2715
02:14:38,340 --> 02:14:38,914
Huh?

2716
02:14:39,159 --> 02:14:40,444
Daddy...

2717
02:14:40,998 --> 02:14:43,369
Alright.
Tell me what you feel.

2718
02:14:47,950 --> 02:14:48,677
Okay.

2719
02:14:50,220 --> 02:14:51,071
Good girl.

2720
02:15:14,724 --> 02:15:18,116
Bujji, Krishnaveni agreed
to marry someone else.

2721
02:15:33,163 --> 02:15:36,148
"The eyes that have seen dreams..."

2722
02:15:37,076 --> 02:15:40,187
"...are now filled with tears"

2723
02:15:41,134 --> 02:15:46,154
"And the heart that shared
loved is wounded"

2724
02:15:49,090 --> 02:15:52,578
"Our steps that walked together..."

2725
02:15:53,074 --> 02:15:57,042
"...have now become lonely"

2726
02:15:57,153 --> 02:16:02,193
"The light that gave a
shadow is left with darkness"

2727
02:16:05,056 --> 02:16:09,176
"The life, unable to"

2728
02:16:09,369 --> 02:16:12,865
"bear the pain of the
preserved love in it,"

2729
02:16:13,121 --> 02:16:17,061
"severed its bond"

2730
02:16:17,161 --> 02:16:22,217
"And the silence has grown
so much distance between us"

2731
02:16:27,288 --> 02:16:30,480
"The eyes that have seen dreams..."

2732
02:16:31,080 --> 02:16:34,448
"...are now filled with tears"

2733
02:16:35,142 --> 02:16:40,149
"And the heart that
shared loved is wounded"

2734
02:16:42,961 --> 02:16:46,626
"Our steps that walked together..."

2735
02:16:47,049 --> 02:16:50,842
"...have now become lonely"

2736
02:16:51,162 --> 02:16:56,074
"The light that gave a
shadow is left with darkness"

2737
02:17:16,454 --> 02:17:17,989
Let's take care of the
rest after the wedding.

2738
02:17:18,097 --> 02:17:18,776
-Okay, sir.
-Father.

2739
02:17:19,150 --> 02:17:19,632
Yes, dear.

2740
02:17:19,661 --> 02:17:20,288
One minute.

2741
02:17:21,178 --> 02:17:22,097
You work on this.

2742
02:17:22,183 --> 02:17:23,889
-Okay, sir.
-I'll speak to him later on the call.

2743
02:17:24,089 --> 02:17:24,699
Come on, sit down, dear.

2744
02:17:27,361 --> 02:17:28,426
[sighs]

2745
02:17:28,679 --> 02:17:29,844
Srinu is going to Japan.

2746
02:17:29,944 --> 02:17:30,986
Let him go.
How does it matter to us?

2747
02:17:36,446 --> 02:17:37,757
What happened, dear?

2748
02:18:01,019 --> 02:18:03,288
Sir,
I am the team leader for this project.

2749
02:18:04,122 --> 02:18:06,817
And I know who's the best person
to got to Japan.

2750
02:18:07,774 --> 02:18:10,943
Konda Srinivasa Rao alias Bujji,

2751
02:18:12,371 --> 02:18:13,597
is the right person to go.

2752
02:18:19,191 --> 02:18:20,026
Excuse me, sir.

2753
02:18:20,275 --> 02:18:20,709
Yeah.

2754
02:18:21,248 --> 02:18:22,600
-I object Krishnaveni.
-Why?

2755
02:18:22,764 --> 02:18:24,601
I am also equally eligible
to go to Japan, sir.

2756
02:18:24,797 --> 02:18:27,656
Hey, let me go!

2757
02:18:28,045 --> 02:18:30,882
At least people might
stay peaceful after I leave.

2758
02:18:32,289 --> 02:18:36,623
Mr. Srinivas, I'm not supporting
you keeping personal reasons in mind.

2759
02:18:37,080 --> 02:18:39,216
-Company needs this so I am supporting.
-[sighs]

2760
02:18:39,818 --> 02:18:41,595
Aren't you doing this
considering personal reasons?

2761
02:18:41,695 --> 02:18:42,709
Didn't you cheat me?

2762
02:18:43,774 --> 02:18:46,335
I thought lying would be better than
telling you the truth and hurting you.

2763
02:18:46,917 --> 02:18:48,151
I just hid the truth,

2764
02:18:48,435 --> 02:18:49,122
but I didn't cheat you.

2765
02:18:50,649 --> 02:18:52,298
Oh, if you're so genuine,

2766
02:18:52,380 --> 02:18:55,041
then why didn't you tell me the truth once
you got to know that I am Krishnaveni?

2767
02:18:56,194 --> 02:18:57,597
You would've told your
parents than escaping from...

2768
02:18:57,688 --> 02:19:00,077
...your wedding that you don't
like your brother-in-law, right?

2769
02:19:01,778 --> 02:19:03,283
They were not ready to listen to me.

2770
02:19:04,127 --> 02:19:05,213
Exactly!

2771
02:19:05,590 --> 02:19:08,190
You are still not in a position
to understand!

2772
02:19:09,576 --> 02:19:10,028
[sighs]

2773
02:19:10,128 --> 02:19:12,146
Sir, are you understanding now?

2774
02:19:12,346 --> 02:19:16,525
She is trying to send Srinivas from here
by keeping personal grudges in mind.

2775
02:19:18,403 --> 02:19:19,454
What is this Krishnaveni?

2776
02:19:19,624 --> 02:19:21,853
Sir, Srinu is very talented.

2777
02:19:22,012 --> 02:19:23,375
Which is why I supported him.

2778
02:19:23,475 --> 02:19:26,751
You rejected this idea for the first
time when I explained it to you.

2779
02:19:26,762 --> 02:19:27,954
The second prototype is his idea.

2780
02:19:28,500 --> 02:19:31,220
And he never tried to take the credit.

2781
02:19:31,549 --> 02:19:33,995
In fact he supported me
being in the team.

2782
02:19:34,095 --> 02:19:36,257
The Japan deal,
he is the one who cracked it.

2783
02:19:36,733 --> 02:19:37,519
Not all this,

2784
02:19:37,682 --> 02:19:40,748
even when he knew I would reject
his love after knowing he is Bujji...

2785
02:19:48,553 --> 02:19:49,742
he saved my mom.

2786
02:20:02,882 --> 02:20:04,798
Guys, I'm convinced.
No more discussions.

2787
02:20:04,998 --> 02:20:06,137
Srinu is the right guy for the job.

2788
02:20:07,171 --> 02:20:07,823
Congratulations.

2789
02:20:07,911 --> 02:20:08,391
Thank you, sir.

2790
02:20:09,528 --> 02:20:12,009
Go to Hyderabad
immediately for visa processing.

2791
02:20:12,109 --> 02:20:12,632
I'll let them know.

2792
02:20:12,709 --> 02:20:13,149
Okay, sir.

2793
02:20:13,210 --> 02:20:13,613
Okay?

2794
02:20:14,733 --> 02:20:16,019
See you guys in the office

2795
02:20:16,243 --> 02:20:17,277
Good job, Krishnaveni!

2796
02:20:33,044 --> 02:20:34,481
When you have developed
feelings for a person,

2797
02:20:35,860 --> 02:20:38,910
it means that you have liked that
person's pros as well as his cons.

2798
02:20:40,825 --> 02:20:42,143
Happy married life.

2799
02:20:53,657 --> 02:20:56,730
Our intention was not to stop
Srinu from going to Japan, Krishnaveni

2800
02:20:58,275 --> 02:21:01,290
It was only to stop him going
away from your life.

2801
02:21:05,503 --> 02:21:06,220
Hmm!

2802
02:21:06,819 --> 02:21:09,503
Who do you know, Srinu or Bujji?

2803
02:21:09,703 --> 02:21:10,571
It's Srinu.

2804
02:21:10,966 --> 02:21:13,191
-What type of person is Srinu?
-He is a very nice guy, daddy.

2805
02:21:13,391 --> 02:21:14,135
Then, what about Bujji?

2806
02:21:16,586 --> 02:21:17,189
[sighs]

2807
02:21:17,289 --> 02:21:20,602
Will you leave a person you loved for
someone whom you have never met?

2808
02:21:23,180 --> 02:21:25,785
[phone rings]

2809
02:21:27,783 --> 02:21:29,931
Tell me, Ms Krishnaveni, the team leader.

2810
02:21:30,031 --> 02:21:31,790
I'm the team leader
Krishnaveni's father speaking.

2811
02:21:32,036 --> 02:21:32,509
Uncle.

2812
02:21:32,603 --> 02:21:34,191
Call my daughter immediately.

2813
02:21:34,391 --> 02:21:35,382
To which number should I call her,
uncle?

2814
02:21:35,582 --> 02:21:36,333
Call to this number.

2815
02:21:38,464 --> 02:21:40,845
Not just her but her father is also crazy.

2816
02:21:41,177 --> 02:21:42,113
We shouldn't compromise, dear.

2817
02:21:42,603 --> 02:21:43,582
He'll only call.

2818
02:21:43,752 --> 02:21:45,165
What should I do if he calls me?

2819
02:21:45,265 --> 02:21:46,109
Let's forgive.

2820
02:21:48,421 --> 02:21:50,842
How will I be a good girl
if I have such a father?

2821
02:21:52,221 --> 02:21:53,451
[phone ringing]

2822
02:21:53,576 --> 02:21:54,349
That's him.

2823
02:21:56,522 --> 02:21:57,378
Hello, brother-in-law.

2824
02:21:57,705 --> 02:21:58,639
Hey, Raja Ravindra!

2825
02:21:58,661 --> 02:21:59,188
Yeah.

2826
02:21:59,290 --> 02:22:00,424
The wedding didn't happen yet.

2827
02:22:00,511 --> 02:22:01,937
Don't call me with relations.

2828
02:22:01,988 --> 02:22:02,628
We'll get confused.

2829
02:22:02,711 --> 02:22:03,193
Okay.

2830
02:22:03,375 --> 02:22:04,049
Daddy.

2831
02:22:05,795 --> 02:22:06,425
[clears throat]

2832
02:22:10,163 --> 02:22:10,841
Srinu.

2833
02:22:10,958 --> 02:22:11,612
Hmm!

2834
02:22:11,696 --> 02:22:12,669
I'm sorry, dear.

2835
02:22:13,663 --> 02:22:14,564
I want you.

2836
02:22:14,647 --> 02:22:15,761
Do you want Bujji or Srinu?

2837
02:22:15,861 --> 02:22:16,678
I want both.

2838
02:22:16,691 --> 02:22:17,688
How much more time is
left for the wedding?

2839
02:22:18,017 --> 02:22:18,968
It's hardly two hours.

2840
02:22:19,026 --> 02:22:20,694
You should have confessed it after the
wedding. It would have been good riddance!

2841
02:22:21,390 --> 02:22:22,270
Srinu...!

2842
02:22:22,378 --> 02:22:23,192
There is no deart of this affection!

2843
02:22:23,447 --> 02:22:26,437
Okay, it's the same station and
the same train. Let's elope.

2844
02:22:27,047 --> 02:22:28,411
Okay.
I'll keep all the gold inside and come.

2845
02:22:28,550 --> 02:22:30,278
Hey, get everything carefully.

2846
02:22:30,678 --> 02:22:31,870
We don't even know when we will return.

2847
02:22:32,045 --> 02:22:33,524
I'd need a lot of money to maintain you.

2848
02:22:33,562 --> 02:22:34,856
-Hey! I'll take you to the task later.
-Bullabbai,

2849
02:22:34,926 --> 02:22:36,281
Take the garlands and keep them there.

2850
02:22:37,371 --> 02:22:39,580
Why are you on call now, dear?

2851
02:22:40,390 --> 02:22:41,931
I'm talking to the groom, grandma.

2852
02:22:42,131 --> 02:22:42,713
[gasps]

2853
02:22:46,954 --> 02:22:47,633
[gasps]

2854
02:22:48,933 --> 02:22:52,104
Oh God!
She might repeat the same thing.

2855
02:22:52,770 --> 02:22:54,488
Groom is not on call...

2856
02:22:59,012 --> 02:23:00,270
She is not here.

2857
02:23:00,355 --> 02:23:02,137
She is missing again.

2858
02:23:05,457 --> 02:23:06,567
Did you see Koteshwar Rao's son?

2859
02:23:06,667 --> 02:23:07,562
-He is also missing.
-[gasps]

2860
02:23:07,921 --> 02:23:08,964
Don't worry.

2861
02:23:09,138 --> 02:23:10,952
Let's not misunderstand.

2862
02:23:11,688 --> 02:23:13,909
Don't repeat the same mistake.

2863
02:23:14,765 --> 02:23:15,618
-Koteshwar Rao...
-Sir...

2864
02:23:15,682 --> 02:23:18,097
Please tell your son and
ask him to find my daughter.

2865
02:23:18,569 --> 02:23:19,863
Sir, Tiger...

2866
02:23:20,370 --> 02:23:21,499
My son is a Tiger.

2867
02:23:21,881 --> 02:23:22,710
Give me a minute.

2868
02:23:22,765 --> 02:23:23,792
[dialling]

2869
02:23:24,144 --> 02:23:24,736
Hello.

2870
02:23:24,847 --> 02:23:28,427
Son, you are going to Hyderabad
without informing it seems.

2871
02:23:28,438 --> 02:23:29,264
How do you know, father?

2872
02:23:29,355 --> 02:23:31,107
I've placed a satellite camera.

2873
02:23:31,526 --> 02:23:32,549
Okay, but...

2874
02:23:33,072 --> 02:23:35,371
...Chamundeshwari's daughter
has eloped again it seems.

2875
02:23:35,471 --> 02:23:37,685
What's wrong with her? She elopes
whenever they arrange a wedding!

2876
02:23:37,885 --> 02:23:41,111
How will we know their issues, dear?

2877
02:23:41,855 --> 02:23:42,867
Okay, but father...

2878
02:23:43,260 --> 02:23:44,858
There is no problem with any
cheque, right?

2879
02:23:45,083 --> 02:23:46,115
No, son.

2880
02:23:46,566 --> 02:23:48,760
I behaved intelligently this time.

2881
02:23:48,960 --> 02:23:52,111
Okay but you should
somehow catch her.

2882
02:23:52,214 --> 02:23:53,378
I'm already holding her, father.

2883
02:23:53,578 --> 02:23:54,739
What are you talking?

2884
02:23:54,750 --> 02:23:56,407
You are an elderly person.
Please try to understand.

2885
02:23:56,767 --> 02:23:57,500
Oh no!

2886
02:23:59,305 --> 02:24:01,000
Oh God!

2887
02:24:02,082 --> 02:24:06,731
Sir, my son said that
he'll catch your daughter.

2888
02:24:06,982 --> 02:24:09,611
Sir, my son is a Tiger.

2889
02:24:10,356 --> 02:24:12,290
-My son is a tiger...
-Excuse me, Tiger's father...

2890
02:24:12,490 --> 02:24:13,476
Oh no!

2891
02:24:15,262 --> 02:24:16,531
Congratulations!

2892
02:24:18,402 --> 02:24:20,162
Did they inform you
while they were leaving?

2893
02:24:20,171 --> 02:24:22,424
-Yeah
-Oh no!

2894

[music]

2895
02:24:34,594 --> 02:24:37,231
"Hey, you troublesome
and exasperating girl..."

2896
02:24:37,291 --> 02:24:41,902
"I've been pursuing you and my plan
got ruined. What did I achieve?"

2897
02:24:43,441 --> 02:24:46,041
"I'm an innocent guy"

2898
02:24:46,094 --> 02:24:49,330
"Do not ravage me, Krishnaveni"

2899
02:24:49,521 --> 02:24:52,188
"I am the guy who is
head over heels for you"

2900
02:24:52,199 --> 02:24:55,312
"Don't try to kill me, Krishnaveni"

2901
02:24:55,502 --> 02:24:58,208
"Krishnaveni... Krishnaveni..."

2902
02:24:58,526 --> 02:25:01,041
"It's all tough with you, Krishnaveni"

2903
02:25:01,152 --> 02:25:04,255
"But I am
head over heels for you, Krishnaveni"

2904
02:25:25,102 --> 02:25:28,592
"I fell in love with you on the day
when I met you on the passenger train"

2905
02:25:31,446 --> 02:25:34,694
"We had good time chatting
on Messenger and Whatsapp"

2906
02:25:37,453 --> 02:25:40,518
"I felt exalted when you've smiled
like the mist of the November month"

2907
02:25:40,529 --> 02:25:43,403
"And I have preserved you in my heart
like the flower of the December month"

2908
02:25:43,503 --> 02:25:47,310
"But you've torn the calender and got
bursted like a cyclinder... Boom!"

2909
02:25:48,056 --> 02:25:50,781
"Krishnaveni... Krishnaveni..."

2910
02:25:51,000 --> 02:25:53,586
"It's all tough with you, Krishnaveni"

2911
02:25:53,788 --> 02:25:56,754
"But I am
head over heels for you, Krishnaveni"

2912
02:25:57,016 --> 02:25:59,883
"Krishnaveni... Krishnaveni..."

2913

"It's all tough with you, Krishnaveni"

2914
02:26:02,605 --> 02:26:05,941
"But I am
head over heels for you, Krishnaveni"

2915
02:26:23,928 --> 02:26:26,894
"I'm the most remarkable guy in my town"

2916
02:26:28,507 --> 02:26:31,512
"But I became a scapegoat
in your mother's plot"

2917
02:26:33,005 --> 02:26:35,889
"And my father has been misled"

2918
02:26:35,993 --> 02:26:38,720
"As I couldn't understand any of this,
I've been binging on booze"

2919
02:26:38,731 --> 02:26:42,070
"We have been dreaming
together all these days"

2920
02:26:42,081 --> 02:26:44,811
"But today, you've become my nightmare"

2921
02:26:44,822 --> 02:26:47,584
"I'm someone who who can't live
without you even for a moment"

2922
02:26:47,595 --> 02:26:50,788
"But you've been hissing
like a snake on the bed"

2923
02:26:50,799 --> 02:26:53,421
"Krishnaveni... Krishnaveni..."

2924
02:26:53,800 --> 02:26:56,436
"It's all tough with you, Krishnaveni"

2925
02:26:56,447 --> 02:26:59,429
"But I am head over heels
for you, Krishnaveni"

2926
02:27:16,715 --> 02:27:19,750
"The matter is so simple but the
things that are at stake are very big"

2927
02:27:21,200 --> 02:27:24,223
"The life of Bujji has become
confined to the roads"

2928
02:27:25,882 --> 02:27:28,676
"She is the girl of his interest
but she is giving him jitters"

2929
02:27:28,732 --> 02:27:31,544
-"Everything is going upside down for him"
-[groaning in pain]

2930
02:27:31,644 --> 02:27:34,571
"He thought he'd marry her"

2931
02:27:34,621 --> 02:27:37,643
"But she is waiting on roads
sharpening a knife to end his life"

2932
02:27:37,718 --> 02:27:40,475
"I don't know how much serious this is..."

2933
02:27:40,586 --> 02:27:43,531
"But my life is making me
carry my own dead body"

2934
02:27:43,542 --> 02:27:46,501
-"Krishnaveni... Krishnaveni..."

2935
02:27:46,656 --> 02:27:49,125
"It's all tough with you, Krishnaveni"

2936
02:27:49,310 --> 02:27:52,122
"But I am
head over heels for you, Krishnaveni"

2937
02:27:52,647 --> 02:27:55,152
"It's all tough with you, Krishnaveni"

2938
02:27:55,174 --> 02:27:58,187
"But I am
head over heels for you, Krishnaveni"

2939
02:27:58,287 --> 02:28:02,166
"I am head over heels
for you, Krishnaveni"
