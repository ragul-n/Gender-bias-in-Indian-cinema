1
00:02:14,935 --> 00:02:19,705
I once recited a story that's full of sweet
memories of college...

2
00:02:19,706 --> 00:02:24,706
carved on classroom benches and the
walls of the corridor...

3
00:02:25,579 --> 00:02:29,281
we are still not satiated

4
00:02:29,282 --> 00:02:34,288
so many fond memories that I need to find
new places to etch them...

5
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:11,833
Dude...who is he?

6
00:03:16,797 --> 00:03:21,797
(Superstar Upendra is mouthing hit
dialogues from his film)

7
00:03:37,451 --> 00:03:39,685
Dude...the movie is over...

8
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:42,462
So what if are done with this film? We have
another Upendra's film.

9
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:45,691
Dude...we have a class to attend

10
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:46,898
Hey,..shut up!

11
00:03:47,294 --> 00:03:51,299
Two previous classes have already been
mass bunked by us

12
00:03:52,032 --> 00:03:56,502
We are now facing an attendance shortage
due to the lack of proxy

13
00:03:56,503 --> 00:04:01,340
The marks scored by us during exams are
missing on our report cards

14
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:08,691
But I'm sure we will clear a couple of
papers during the revals

15
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:13,586
Two previous classes have already been
mass bunked by us

16
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:18,324
We are now facing an attendance shortage
due to the lack of proxy

17
00:04:18,325 --> 00:04:23,325
The marks scored by us during exams are
missing on our report cards

18
00:04:23,396 --> 00:04:30,006
But I'm sure we will clear a couple of
papers during the revals

19
00:04:37,911 --> 00:04:39,411
It will be useful in the future

20
00:04:39,412 --> 00:04:39,719
Yes

21
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,851
Crowd cheers for Sanvi

22
00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:24,085
I once recited a story that's full of sweet
memories of college...

23
00:05:24,124 --> 00:05:29,665
carved on classroom benches and the
walls of the corridor...

24
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:33,465
Saanvi...

25
00:05:33,466 --> 00:05:37,471
your's is the only name that is written in the
pages of all
our life stories...

26
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:10,502
Aren't quarrels a pan of friendship?

27
00:06:10,503 --> 00:06:14,713
Compromise and understand that in unity
lies strength

28
00:06:15,842 --> 00:06:20,086
One or two strikes are essential in the
name oi social cause

29
00:06:20,847 --> 00:06:25,762
Seems like our time in college will not
suffice,
so let us buy a site on the campus

30
00:06:26,653 --> 00:06:28,520
Oh s%&*t the power went 0TH!

31
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:28,654
Oh s%&*t the power went 0TH!

32
00:06:28,655 --> 00:06:29,655
Yeah, I can see that...

33
00:06:29,656 --> 00:06:30,856
How the hell can you see in the dark???

34
00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:33,859
Manager...where the hell are you???
Switch on the generator

35
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:36,670
Manager...where the hell are you???

36
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:28,149
Manager please take them away!!

37
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:34,019
He couldn't figure out who it was!

38
00:09:28,968 --> 00:09:31,737
Dude, I'm leaving. Come along if you want
to

39
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:33,775
Where to?

40
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:47,854
Mark it, lm sure it won't appear in the
question paper!

41
00:10:15,648 --> 00:10:17,821
How about we all wear a tie to the talents
day?

42
00:10:17,884 --> 00:10:19,295
Oho... so sad

43
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:20,697
That's 0k, I'll help her.

44
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:21,788
Dude, move aside...

45
00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:23,429
I'll help too!

46
00:10:24,257 --> 00:10:24,860
It's ok.

47
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:26,267
Here, take your book.

48
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:29,928
Here, take it.

49
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:30,964
It's a little heavy... here's another book.

50
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:38,171
Ohh... have we picked all the books?

51
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:47,716
Dude I gave her three books!

52
00:10:47,881 --> 00:10:50,015
This guy pretended to pick books long after
we were done!

53
00:10:50,016 --> 00:10:51,757
Who the hell was looking at the books??

54
00:10:52,352 --> 00:10:53,387
Do you need any help?

55
00:10:54,254 --> 00:10:55,130
Yeah...l thought as much...

56
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:11,370
ls it a long climb up?

57
00:11:11,371 --> 00:11:13,146
Yes, we need to get to the third floor

58
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:16,076
Ok, then do me a favour...

59
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:21,013
please open this book for me...

60
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:21,847
Why?

61
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:25,784
I love reading...it will be a good timepass

62
00:11:25,785 --> 00:11:27,787
So what books have you read?

63
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:32,854
I am a voracious reader, but I can't recall
the names in an instant

64
00:11:32,992 --> 00:11:35,063
Oh yeah, but the other day, I read an
article written by you

65
00:11:35,328 --> 00:11:36,094
Ok...which one?

66
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:39,907
The one you wrote on sex workers

67
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:45,209
So did you read it because of me, or did
the topic interest you?

68
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:49,353
That's a valid point. Will ponder over it and
let you know.

69
00:11:56,816 --> 00:11:59,023
I had never had a bird's eye view of the
college before.

70
00:11:59,352 --> 00:12:01,186
By the way, what are you doing here?

71
00:12:01,187 --> 00:12:04,361
I teach Kannada to the non Kannadigas

72
00:12:05,325 --> 00:12:07,192
So do you speak Kannada fluently?

73
00:12:07,193 --> 00:12:09,862
Hello! I studied in a residential school...

74
00:12:09,863 --> 00:12:14,005
so, even though I may not speak fluent
Kannada,
I can read and write it perfectly.

75
00:12:16,536 --> 00:12:18,413
Good to know that.

76
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:20,372
You must have a full house then?

77
00:12:20,373 --> 00:12:21,852
Oh...yes...

78
00:12:24,477 --> 00:12:25,210
Shall I keep these books here?

79
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:26,383
Sure

80
00:12:30,383 --> 00:12:32,556
Oh...what a massive crowd!

81
00:12:33,186 --> 00:12:35,063
I can't even see the faces of the ones
sitting in the last bench!

82
00:12:35,822 --> 00:12:37,392
It must be tough to control so many of
them!

83
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:40,559
I've heard a lot about you.

84
00:13:43,856 --> 00:13:46,097
Being in the first year, you're already trying
to cozy up to the seniors.

85
00:13:58,137 --> 00:14:01,914
Then you help her by carrying her books to
the third floor.

86
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:06,988
I know, you're trying to impress a senior.

87
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:15,124
L've been speaking to you for such a long
time and
you don't even have the courtesy to stand
up in front of a senior!!

88
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:19,861
Sir, please sit down...

89
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,446
Sir, there's no chair in sight...

90
00:14:35,074 --> 00:14:36,108
Oh my god!

91
00:14:36,109 --> 00:14:42,253
At 8 pm, it's scorching hot! Where are my
sunglasses?

92
00:14:48,321 --> 00:14:50,392
Manja, be quiet!

93
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:15,482
(Swears in his mother tongue)

94
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:25,192
Everybody...listen up...silence...one
minute please...

95
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:28,965
The reason we've all gathered here today
is...

96
00:15:29,529 --> 00:15:30,371
to take revenge.

97
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:36,608
A senior has barged into our room and
beaten up one of us...

98
00:15:37,003 --> 00:15:38,482
Look at the way he's been thrashed...

99
00:15:39,138 --> 00:15:40,708
He's been thrashed like a dog!

100
00:15:41,073 --> 00:15:45,610
Just because we are juniors, they're
harassing us.

101
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,682
This has got to stop now.

102
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:51,395
Who is this mad cap??

103
00:15:51,484 --> 00:15:52,150
Hey dude!

104
00:15:52,151 --> 00:15:53,151
Juniors are...

105
00:15:53,152 --> 00:15:54,119
Here take this...

106
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:54,986
Why?

107
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:56,660
Take it. Such important matters need to be
conveyed from a prominent platform.

108
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:03,270
What do they take us juniors for?

109
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:04,467
Poor fellow.

110
00:16:04,997 --> 00:16:06,565
The way he's been beaten up...his teeth
are...

111
00:16:06,566 --> 00:16:07,670
His teeth are rattling

112
00:16:08,201 --> 00:16:09,201
Look at how badly he's been thrashed

113
00:16:09,202 --> 00:16:10,306
He's been thrashed like a dog!

114
00:16:11,037 --> 00:16:13,605
It we tolerate this behavior without protest,

115
00:16:13,606 --> 00:16:16,775
we will go down in our college history as
cowards.

116
00:16:16,776 --> 00:16:19,644
If we put up a united fight now,

117
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:22,558
we will be known as legends among our
juniors in the future!

118
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:28,956
Long after we have passed out of this
college,
ourjuniors must recite tales of our bravery.

119
00:16:31,357 --> 00:16:34,395
All of you once more take a look at that
poor innocent boy...

120
00:16:35,428 --> 00:16:36,494
look at how badly he's been thrashed...

121
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:38,396
He's been thrashed like a dog!

122
00:16:38,397 --> 00:16:40,732
Ok fan boys...shut up!

123
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:42,110
Is everyone with me on this?

124
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:50,475
Boss, it was your idea to wear a tie.

125
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:53,218
But seems like the whole college is
wearing it today!

126
00:17:05,658 --> 00:17:06,500
What's your problem?

127
00:17:11,097 --> 00:17:14,271
(Curses in his mother tongue)

128
00:17:28,314 --> 00:17:29,725
Come on boys...

129
00:17:30,116 --> 00:17:31,527
Pick up a bat and come fast...

130
00:20:24,957 --> 00:20:29,235
Are you the six students who've been
suspended?

131
00:20:29,962 --> 00:20:33,865
Sir, we are not wastrels...

132
00:20:33,866 --> 00:20:37,335
we are just bored of doing nothing

133
00:20:37,336 --> 00:20:41,580
We do not intend on escaping to the
nearest bar

134
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:44,854
But we seem to find no other way

135
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:49,723
If you throw us last benchers out of
college,

136
00:20:49,815 --> 00:20:53,051
Let me go, I have a class to take

137
00:20:53,052 --> 00:20:57,330
We have no problem, it is their reputation
that will be at stake

138
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:46,037
Dad it's me Manja.

139
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:47,539
I needed 10 thousand rupees urgently.

140
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:48,106
Why son?

141
00:21:48,107 --> 00:21:49,518
I have to buy a lethe machine

142
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:51,309
What? A lethe machine??

143
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:54,479
Yes dad, I want to get the question paper
leaked and later sell them.

144
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,648
All I need to invest is ten thousand rupees.
It's a profitable business.

145
00:21:56,649 --> 00:21:58,526
Very good my son. I'll send the money right
away.

146
00:21:58,751 --> 00:22:00,355
He agreed that easily?

147
00:22:02,421 --> 00:22:04,367
What's your dad's profession?

148
00:22:05,725 --> 00:22:10,003
Balcony seats for 200 rupees only...

149
00:22:11,931 --> 00:22:13,464
We have 30,000 rupees

150
00:22:13,465 --> 00:22:14,910
We have 50,000 rupees

151
00:22:15,101 --> 00:22:16,501
How did you manage to collect all this
money?

152
00:22:16,502 --> 00:22:17,402
What can I do...?

153
00:22:17,403 --> 00:22:21,372
The price of revaluation fees, tuition fees,
electricity bill and canteen bill have all shot
up.

154
00:22:21,373 --> 00:22:21,940
What about the water supply bill?

155
00:22:21,941 --> 00:22:22,885
It's still being printed.

156
00:22:27,146 --> 00:22:29,456
Dude. ..look for cheap cars

157
00:22:32,985 --> 00:22:34,589
80 thousand rupees?!!!

158
00:22:36,088 --> 00:22:37,829
We are still short of another 30 thousand
rupees“.

159
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:42,894
Blessed with divine information while in the
womb...

160
00:22:42,895 --> 00:22:45,603
all that is left for me is to execute the
mission.

161
00:22:46,732 --> 00:22:50,612
I will once again rebuild the Rama
Sethuve...

162
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:52,103
Dude...but there's no water!

163
00:22:52,104 --> 00:22:53,674
But why do you need water to build a
bfldge?

164
00:22:55,574 --> 00:22:59,488
I will once again rebuild the Rama
Sethuve...

165
00:22:59,778 --> 00:23:03,692
My gang of workers is ready...

166
00:23:04,617 --> 00:23:11,762
We have so much more work to do and
many more miles to go...

167
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:19,032
But where's the time do all of it...for time
itself is running short

168
00:23:19,632 --> 00:23:22,738
The burden on our shoulders is a lot...

169
00:23:23,702 --> 00:23:26,148
may be we could share it

170
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:32,143
Such a beautiful car.

171
00:23:32,144 --> 00:23:33,578
Why are you selling it for such a cheap
pflce?

172
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:34,785
Is there a problem with it?

173
00:23:34,847 --> 00:23:37,148
Absolutely no problem!

174
00:23:37,149 --> 00:23:39,425
It came here for repairs.

175
00:23:39,952 --> 00:23:43,900
I called the owner after repairing it
and told him him to pay 80 thousand
rupees and take it.

176
00:23:44,056 --> 00:23:48,004
To which he said, “Dude, get lost.
I can get a new car for that amount.You
can keep this one!.

177
00:23:48,127 --> 00:23:49,003
What did he say sir?

178
00:23:49,061 --> 00:23:53,066
He said, “Dude, get lost.
I can get a new car for that amount. You
can keep this one!”

179
00:23:54,133 --> 00:23:58,206
But I have my doubts that this bundle
contains only 50 thousand rupees.

180
00:23:58,704 --> 00:24:01,412
And we have our doubts if this car is really
in a working condition...

181
00:24:02,608 --> 00:24:03,608
All this is ok.

182
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:06,556
But don't betray me when you have to pay
the balance of thirty thousand rupees, ok?

183
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,892
I heard six students have been suspended
from your college.

184
00:24:12,918 --> 00:24:14,226
Are you the same guys?

185
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,623
Sir, we are not wastrels...

186
00:24:18,624 --> 00:24:21,662
we are just bored of doing nothing

187
00:24:22,261 --> 00:24:26,209
We do not intend on escaping to the
nearest bar

188
00:24:26,265 --> 00:24:29,576
But we seem to find no other way

189
00:24:30,069 --> 00:24:34,575
If you throw us last benchers out of
college,

190
00:24:37,743 --> 00:24:39,744
we have no problem

191
00:24:39,745 --> 00:24:41,986
It is your reputation that will be at stake

192
00:25:05,804 --> 00:25:08,307
Dude...let's give her a drop today.

193
00:25:10,809 --> 00:25:12,880
Who will be the lucky boys to drop her?

194
00:25:16,549 --> 00:25:17,960
The two of us.

195
00:25:19,852 --> 00:25:21,763
The key is with me.

196
00:25:28,327 --> 00:25:29,931
The three of us.

197
00:25:37,903 --> 00:25:39,849
Did you gather all these students?

198
00:25:42,975 --> 00:25:47,321
The last two rows of students were
arranged by me.

199
00:25:48,981 --> 00:25:51,783
Why are you here? Don't you already know
Kannada?

200
00:25:51,784 --> 00:25:54,765
I do. I came here to supervise the others.

201
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:07,298
How are you?

202
00:26:07,299 --> 00:26:08,004
We are fine!

203
00:26:12,638 --> 00:26:14,640
Dude...ask her!

204
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:16,575
I'll ask her...wait.

205
00:26:16,842 --> 00:26:19,618
And when you have to reply, you say I'm
fine.

206
00:26:31,857 --> 00:26:34,337
Kama bought a new car...

207
00:26:34,393 --> 00:26:37,135
Yes...l've bought a new car...it's just been
two days.

208
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,215
Kama has bought a new car.

209
00:26:57,216 --> 00:26:59,283
He can drop me home any time.

210
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:01,389
Any time Sanvi. After all it's just a drop.

211
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:13,141
Dude, what she means is... leave the
class!

212
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,411
Are you guys coming with me?

213
00:27:32,851 --> 00:27:35,887
Sanvi, my friends will feel abandoned...

214
00:27:35,888 --> 00:27:37,221
Take all of them with you

215
00:27:37,222 --> 00:27:39,924
ll I take all of them, the class will be empty.

216
00:27:39,925 --> 00:27:42,667
Just send the first two rows.

217
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:46,104
Come on guys...

218
00:27:53,806 --> 00:27:56,908
The deed is done. We have finally told her
that we've bought a car.

219
00:27:56,909 --> 00:28:00,254
Not we. She thinks you bought a car.

220
00:28:02,314 --> 00:28:03,347
You really don't want a drink?

221
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:04,952
Who said so? I gave it to you to pour soda
into it.

222
00:28:06,485 --> 00:28:07,452
Ask him

223
00:28:07,453 --> 00:28:09,126
Wait...l'll ask

224
00:28:09,755 --> 00:28:11,322
Dude...pour me some soda

225
00:28:11,323 --> 00:28:12,824
I'm doing it

226
00:28:12,825 --> 00:28:15,026
Not that...ask him about the car

227
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:17,200
Dude...tell me about the car

228
00:28:17,496 --> 00:28:21,034
Yes, the car! Manja, go check if the car is
parked right.

229
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:37,152
Dude...come sit down...why are you still
standing?

230
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:39,817
Did you ask him?

231
00:28:39,818 --> 00:28:40,151
Did you ask him?

232
00:28:40,152 --> 00:28:42,954
<i>Kama, San“ 'vs Wee years skier than us.</i>

233
00:28:42,955 --> 00:28:44,322
Do you think it will work out?

234
00:28:44,323 --> 00:28:47,270
You fool! In three years time, won't I be of
the same age?

235
00:28:48,861 --> 00:28:51,341
I too will be of the same age in three years.

236
00:28:53,165 --> 00:28:55,771
Damn! We are out of booze

237
00:28:58,971 --> 00:29:00,271
Hello...it's me Ghouse.

238
00:29:00,272 --> 00:29:02,440
Oh hello sir! How are you?

239
00:29:02,441 --> 00:29:04,175
Why so many missed calls since morning?

240
00:29:04,176 --> 00:29:06,877
Yeah exactly...if you don't answer a call,
it becomes a missed call.

241
00:29:06,878 --> 00:29:09,358
What about the balance payment?

242
00:29:10,883 --> 00:29:13,363
Manja, go check if the car is parked right.

243
00:29:16,822 --> 00:29:18,356
Sir...so what was I saying...

244
00:29:18,357 --> 00:29:19,824
You were talking about the balance
payment

245
00:29:19,825 --> 00:29:22,527
It's ready. I will give it as soon as you
come.

246
00:29:22,528 --> 00:29:23,928
Oh you're ready with the money?

247
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:25,062
Yes.

248
00:29:25,063 --> 00:29:29,333
And on your way here, pick up six beers
and short eats.

249
00:29:29,334 --> 00:29:31,135
Aye dude...where's the money for all that?

250
00:29:31,136 --> 00:29:33,104
You've kept aside some money for petrol,
right?

251
00:29:33,105 --> 00:29:34,448
Then where's the money for petrol?

252
00:29:34,873 --> 00:29:37,353
Our's is a diesel car, dude! Why do we
need petrol?

253
00:29:41,413 --> 00:29:44,048
Who's going to pay for the short eats?

254
00:29:44,049 --> 00:29:47,826
We'll pay you for everything. You just get
here.

255
00:29:49,488 --> 00:29:50,988
Dude, the car is parked right.

256
00:29:50,989 --> 00:29:52,557
Dude, I made some calculations.

257
00:29:52,558 --> 00:29:53,891
I've poured the periect measure, right?

258
00:29:53,892 --> 00:29:54,559
I'm not referring to the drink.

259
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,828
You were talking about something else a
while ago...

260
00:29:56,829 --> 00:30:00,932
Oh that? Manja, go check it the car is
parked right?

261
00:30:00,933 --> 00:30:01,934
Why me every time?

262
00:30:02,868 --> 00:30:05,144
Yeah...just to check if the car is parked
right...

263
00:30:07,406 --> 00:30:08,573
Now I remember!

264
00:30:08,574 --> 00:30:11,521
In three year's time, won't Sanvi too be
three years older?

265
00:30:12,577 --> 00:30:14,147
Yes, that's right.

266
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:17,356
It's just three years after all. We'll manage
some how.

267
00:30:24,222 --> 00:30:27,169
Look at the way they are queuing up for
free cake!

268
00:30:28,327 --> 00:30:30,068
Absolutely shameless!

269
00:30:34,099 --> 00:30:36,545
These guys follow us everywhere...

270
00:30:39,905 --> 00:30:41,316
Where are you going dude?

271
00:30:42,107 --> 00:30:43,107
I'll go get a piece of cake

272
00:30:43,108 --> 00:30:45,088
Dude! Make it two pieces.

273
00:30:51,216 --> 00:30:53,218
Look at him! He's running after Saanvi

274
00:31:03,462 --> 00:31:05,863
You had asked me to drop you home
yesterday...

275
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:06,934
When do you want me to drop you?

276
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,874
Remember we spoke about it during
Kannada class...

277
00:31:13,338 --> 00:31:14,605
I don't need it.

278
00:31:14,606 --> 00:31:17,086
Oh, you don't need it? She doesn't need it
dude. ..buzz off!

279
00:31:17,609 --> 00:31:19,543
Sorry...but I'm getting late

280
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:21,046
Why are you leaving early today?

281
00:31:21,346 --> 00:31:23,451
I have to go home and to the church after

282
00:31:25,417 --> 00:31:27,363
But why are you off to church?

283
00:31:27,619 --> 00:31:28,962
What do you mean why?

284
00:31:34,493 --> 00:31:38,195
Oh sorry...just a moment...

285
00:31:38,196 --> 00:31:39,436
you please continue...

286
00:31:41,633 --> 00:31:45,136
Guys, I don't think it's going to work out.
Saanvi is a Christian.

287
00:31:45,137 --> 00:31:46,207
She's a Christian??

288
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:56,047
I heard you're ofi to the church!

289
00:31:56,048 --> 00:31:56,924
Yes

290
00:31:57,115 --> 00:31:59,186
Come, let's chat along the way...

291
00:31:59,384 --> 00:32:01,385
Come let me drop you. I have my car

292
00:32:01,386 --> 00:32:02,620
That's ok. I don't want to trouble you.

293
00:32:02,621 --> 00:32:04,032
Oh, it's no trouble at all

294
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:10,901
It's been a while since I went to church,
too.

295
00:32:13,665 --> 00:32:15,372
My father is a priest in the church

296
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:18,979
What does your dad do?

297
00:32:22,374 --> 00:32:25,321
Oh...Just a moment...l'll be back

298
00:32:27,345 --> 00:32:30,326
Dude...we've all had a discussion and are
perfectly fine with a Christian girl

299
00:32:30,749 --> 00:32:32,116
Her dad's a cop

300
00:32:32,117 --> 00:32:33,118
A cop??

301
00:32:33,418 --> 00:32:37,321
A cop? Then he must definitely know my
father.

302
00:32:37,322 --> 00:32:38,096
Ok, I'll catch you guys later.

303
00:32:50,469 --> 00:32:54,538
Saanvi, you're dad is rocking on television!

304
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:57,520
He's thrashed some fellow who sells black
tickets at a theatre.

305
00:32:59,344 --> 00:33:01,345
One moment...which theatre was it?

306
00:33:01,346 --> 00:33:02,416
Nanhaki

307
00:33:06,151 --> 00:33:09,132
Just a moment...l'll be back...

308
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:15,034
Dude...we've had another round of
discussion...

309
00:33:15,193 --> 00:33:17,094
we're okay with having a cop for a father-
in-law

310
00:33:17,095 --> 00:33:20,765
Dude...l don't think it's going to workout...

311
00:33:20,766 --> 00:33:21,799
Why?

312
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:24,804
Both our dads don't match in their
professional ethics

313
00:33:25,437 --> 00:33:26,415
Ok, I'm leaving

314
00:33:27,172 --> 00:33:30,449
Yes, I too felt that none of this will work out.

315
00:33:31,176 --> 00:33:35,215
Ok you guys carry on. I have some
personal work to attend to.

316
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:37,288
Dude, we too will join you!

317
00:33:41,153 --> 00:33:42,097
It's personal guys...

318
00:33:42,153 --> 00:33:43,530
Dude, we too will join you!

319
00:33:44,289 --> 00:33:45,529
Okay come

320
00:33:58,637 --> 00:33:59,479
What is he looking for?

321
00:34:02,641 --> 00:34:03,483
This side?

322
00:34:03,742 --> 00:34:04,618
Looks like he is trying to fool us...

323
00:34:19,424 --> 00:34:20,324
What are you gaping at?

324
00:34:20,325 --> 00:34:21,826
The principal's car has broken down.
Come let's help.

325
00:34:21,827 --> 00:34:23,360
Who...us??

326
00:34:23,361 --> 00:34:24,704
Yes...come

327
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:26,597
Ok...come on guys..

328
00:34:26,598 --> 00:34:28,669
What are you doing? Can't you even push
a car properly?

329
00:34:32,237 --> 00:34:33,341
Guys...join in...

330
00:34:36,241 --> 00:34:37,413
Go on... push...

331
00:34:39,411 --> 00:34:41,912
Sir, my friends will push the car.

332
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:43,314
You keep trying to start the car.

333
00:34:43,315 --> 00:34:44,885
I'll go and fetch the mechanic in a jifiy.

334
00:34:50,455 --> 00:34:52,230
Please do a good job with the pushing
9W5

335
00:34:55,894 --> 00:34:59,307
Push...push...push

336
00:35:01,366 --> 00:35:02,242
Stop kicking me and push the car!

337
00:35:07,739 --> 00:35:10,345
Dude...do you have the car keys?

338
00:35:39,371 --> 00:35:41,112
I missed my bus because of you

339
00:35:41,306 --> 00:35:43,582
Why worry? I'll drop you.

340
00:35:47,846 --> 00:35:48,847
Is it broken down?

341
00:36:20,478 --> 00:36:20,711
Come, let's go

342
00:36:20,712 --> 00:36:22,248
Dude, please do a good job with the
analysis.

343
00:36:23,682 --> 00:36:25,457
Haha...we've put him in a spot now!

344
00:36:26,618 --> 00:36:29,653
Saanvi, there are no buses for the next halt
houn

345
00:36:29,654 --> 00:36:31,429
Besides, it look like it might rain.

346
00:36:31,523 --> 00:36:36,529
I have my car. If you wish, I can drop you.
No compulsion.

347
00:36:42,767 --> 00:36:44,371
Isn't this Karna's car?

348
00:36:44,836 --> 00:36:47,476
No way! It's my car.

349
00:36:51,009 --> 00:36:52,750
Also his

350
00:36:55,714 --> 00:36:57,489
Also his

351
00:36:59,284 --> 00:36:59,955
Ohh you too are here?

352
00:37:01,953 --> 00:37:03,728
Theirs, too.

353
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:07,794
Let's go.

354
00:37:07,959 --> 00:37:09,905
I was just waiting for you guys to come

355
00:37:11,763 --> 00:37:13,538
Yeah...sure...we know you!

356
00:37:15,367 --> 00:37:16,778
Loki, change the gear.

357
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:23,549
Saanvi, here's an umbrella, looks like it is
going to rain.

358
00:37:26,611 --> 00:37:28,648
Dude switch to the third gear.

359
00:37:31,049 --> 00:37:32,790
And once you hit 60 kmph, switch to the
fourth.

360
00:37:34,853 --> 00:37:41,737
(Quotes a poem...)

361
00:37:43,295 --> 00:37:44,296
Didn't you write this?

362
00:37:44,362 --> 00:37:44,762
Yes

363
00:37:44,763 --> 00:37:45,503
It's fantastic.

364
00:37:46,398 --> 00:37:48,002
Dude, please recite the next line

365
00:37:51,069 --> 00:37:58,351
Continues with the poem...

366
00:38:01,713 --> 00:38:03,989
This is the best line

367
00:38:04,549 --> 00:38:06,324
Dude...there's a hump ahead

368
00:38:08,987 --> 00:38:10,728
Why are you silent?

369
00:38:10,889 --> 00:38:12,562
He's extremely shy

370
00:38:14,592 --> 00:38:15,468
Sanvi.

371
00:38:16,828 --> 00:38:18,603
You are extremely beautiful!

372
00:38:23,101 --> 00:38:24,011
Here take this.

373
00:38:24,736 --> 00:38:25,680
What is this for?

374
00:38:26,071 --> 00:38:28,711
You're off to the church isn't it? Take this as
an offering.

375
00:38:29,941 --> 00:38:30,817
Ohh, the coconut fell down!

376
00:38:32,911 --> 00:38:34,686
Don't worry. There's no problem. Give me
two minutes.

377
00:38:35,346 --> 00:38:36,347
Il fix it right away.

378
00:38:39,818 --> 00:38:43,095
Saanvi, I'll step out. I need some fresh air.

379
00:38:43,822 --> 00:38:45,563
Hello...Ghouse...

380
00:39:08,646 --> 00:39:09,947
Please come...

381
00:39:09,948 --> 00:39:11,120
Hold this!

382
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:14,487
Dude...where were you? We looked
everywhere for you.

383
00:39:17,122 --> 00:39:18,123
I was reading in the library

384
00:39:19,624 --> 00:39:20,796
What were you reading?

385
00:39:21,593 --> 00:39:24,540
Traitors...the title of the book!

386
00:39:24,929 --> 00:39:28,536
Talking of books, what about my balance
payment?

387
00:39:29,534 --> 00:39:30,945
What's the connection between balance
payment and books?

388
00:39:31,402 --> 00:39:33,036
Connection?

389
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:34,778
Is there one between you and the library?

390
00:39:35,807 --> 00:39:37,582
Damn! I'm getting late.

391
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:39,817
There are no buses for the next half hour.

392
00:39:40,412 --> 00:39:41,982
Besides, it looks like it might rain. I have
my scooter.

393
00:39:43,014 --> 00:39:44,960
If you wish, I can drop you. No compulsion.

394
00:39:46,184 --> 00:39:47,162
Sly fellow!

395
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:55,996
May I ride the scooter?

396
00:40:04,469 --> 00:40:06,574
He is such a lucky guy!

397
00:40:31,062 --> 00:40:35,442
Whose face did I see when I woke up this
morning?

398
00:40:35,567 --> 00:40:39,982
Is it the goddess of beauty or luck who is
sitting in front of me?

399
00:40:40,805 --> 00:40:43,173
The black and white dream that I saw last
night

400
00:40:43,174 --> 00:40:44,949
has turned
colouriul today...

401
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:50,216
I am now in the mood to pen poems in your
name

402
00:40:50,682 --> 00:40:51,888
In your dreams...

403
00:40:53,051 --> 00:40:54,462
She comes close to you...

404
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:56,731
Cuddles you...

405
00:40:58,156 --> 00:40:59,990
I can't handle her tickles

406
00:40:59,991 --> 00:41:00,724
Once more...

407
00:41:00,725 --> 00:41:01,726
In your dreams...

408
00:41:02,894 --> 00:41:04,168
She comes close to you...

409
00:41:05,496 --> 00:41:06,770
Cuddles you...

410
00:41:08,166 --> 00:41:09,941
I can't handle her tickles

411
00:41:13,104 --> 00:41:13,904
ls this your house?

412
00:41:13,905 --> 00:41:14,440
Yes

413
00:41:15,807 --> 00:41:16,717
What are you searching for?

414
00:41:17,742 --> 00:41:18,447
Which is your room?

415
00:41:18,977 --> 00:41:21,480
The one with the balcony

416
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:24,123
So you keep coming to the balcony often??

417
00:41:51,242 --> 00:41:52,843
Hey, what do you want?

418
00:41:52,844 --> 00:41:54,177
Looking for Saanvi Joseph.

419
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:55,054
Same family, give it to me.

420
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:58,585
Sir please sign here.

421
00:42:00,084 --> 00:42:00,960
Over here?

422
00:42:06,157 --> 00:42:10,731
I 'm trying to chart a new territory in love...

423
00:42:11,262 --> 00:42:14,766
But I tend to lose track sometimes...

424
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:20,937
The art of conveying emotions through
gestures...

425
00:42:20,938 --> 00:42:25,148
Wait and find out for yourself the true
essence of love

426
00:42:26,611 --> 00:42:31,214
The enduring bond...

427
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:36,164
the captivating intimacy...

428
00:42:42,293 --> 00:42:47,264
The desire to be around you has now
grown stronger...

429
00:42:47,265 --> 00:42:52,169
The moments that I spend with you have
surpassed even my expectations...

430
00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:53,342
In your dreams...

431
00:42:54,772 --> 00:42:55,944
She comes close to you...

432
00:42:57,175 --> 00:42:58,347
Cuddles you...

433
00:43:00,078 --> 00:43:01,745
I can't handle her tickles

434
00:43:01,746 --> 00:43:03,316
Hi Saanvi, how come you called at this
hour?

435
00:43:04,649 --> 00:43:05,821
You're unable to sleep?

436
00:43:07,185 --> 00:43:08,391
Even lm unable to do so

437
00:43:10,021 --> 00:43:11,193
We are unable to contain our envy!!

438
00:43:12,357 --> 00:43:13,631
Hi Sanvi

439
00:43:13,691 --> 00:43:16,026
Kama, I need your help and it's urgent?
Can you come home?

440
00:43:16,027 --> 00:43:19,930
There's no time to explain. Tell me can you
make it or not?

441
00:43:19,931 --> 00:43:23,140
It's what I wanted anyway. I'll be there in
half an hour.

442
00:43:36,714 --> 00:43:37,881
Where are we going?

443
00:43:37,882 --> 00:43:40,083
Sonu, we'll be there in ten minutes.

444
00:43:40,084 --> 00:43:41,256
Karna, make it quick.

445
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:47,132
Whose face did I see when I woke up this
morning?

446
00:43:47,859 --> 00:43:52,262
Is it the goddess of beauty or luck who is
sitting in front of me?

447
00:43:52,263 --> 00:43:54,965
The black and white dream that I saw last
night

448
00:43:54,966 --> 00:43:57,037
has turned
colouriul today...

449
00:43:57,301 --> 00:44:02,072
I am now in the mood to pen poems in your
name

450
00:44:02,073 --> 00:44:03,416
In your dreams...

451
00:44:04,776 --> 00:44:05,948
She comes close to you...

452
00:44:07,078 --> 00:44:08,250
Cuddles you...

453
00:44:09,881 --> 00:44:11,087
I can't handle her tickles

454
00:44:11,749 --> 00:44:12,249
Once more...

455
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:13,752
In your dreams...

456
00:44:14,419 --> 00:44:15,762
She comes close to you...

457
00:44:16,888 --> 00:44:18,060
Cuddles you...

458
00:44:19,390 --> 00:44:21,425
I can't handle her tickles

459
00:44:21,426 --> 00:44:21,665
I can't handle her tickles

460
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:24,306
Karna, what are doing?

461
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:33,243
Saanvi, where are we going?

462
00:44:33,871 --> 00:44:35,441
Remember the article I wrote on a sex
worker?

463
00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:37,310
We are going to see her.

464
00:44:37,975 --> 00:44:39,750
Oh, her? This is her house.

465
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:44,060
I heard the wails and guessed this must be
it

466
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:48,330
Sonu, don't worry. Let's go to the hospital.

467
00:45:01,499 --> 00:45:02,876
Karna, let's go to a hospital. Quick!

468
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:05,108
Don't yell. I'm getting tensed.

469
00:45:11,209 --> 00:45:12,984
We have a woman in labour.

470
00:45:13,778 --> 00:45:15,348
Not her. She's in the car.

471
00:45:30,328 --> 00:45:32,171
Sir, we need a signature...

472
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:34,764
from the father of the child.

473
00:45:34,765 --> 00:45:35,334
That's not me!

474
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,308
Even a guardian can sign

475
00:45:48,279 --> 00:45:49,849
What happened? ls she okay?

476
00:45:53,184 --> 00:45:54,754
Do you want to see the baby?

477
00:45:55,286 --> 00:45:56,230
No that's ok.

478
00:45:56,387 --> 00:45:57,764
Come on...

479
00:46:17,575 --> 00:46:18,315
Thank you!

480
00:46:19,977 --> 00:46:21,388
Don't thank me. Thank him.

481
00:46:23,314 --> 00:46:24,418
The baby is extremely cute

482
00:46:26,851 --> 00:46:29,820
lithe baby is alive today,

483
00:46:29,821 --> 00:46:31,888
Saanvi is the reason for it.

484
00:46:31,889 --> 00:46:36,304
If not for her, I'd have aborted it long time
ago.

485
00:46:37,595 --> 00:46:43,773
I was frightened to even think of how she'd
be treated by society.

486
00:46:43,834 --> 00:46:46,603
Saanvi gave me courage.

487
00:46:46,604 --> 00:46:51,519
In my line of work, there's no lack of people
who display love

488
00:46:52,543 --> 00:46:55,285
But nobody sticks around.

489
00:46:56,614 --> 00:47:01,586
I don't know if this child is a fruit of love or
lust,

490
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:06,163
but I'm going to raise her with all my love

491
00:47:20,438 --> 00:47:21,473
What are you thinking about?

492
00:47:22,106 --> 00:47:23,517
I was thinking about the baby

493
00:47:25,610 --> 00:47:29,956
We will do our best. The rest is upto God.

494
00:47:31,582 --> 00:47:34,985
Once upon a time, even Sonu was a little
girl.

495
00:47:34,986 --> 00:47:38,092
Was it pan of God's plan to make her a sex
worker?

496
00:47:39,323 --> 00:47:42,526
Why are you assuming that the baby won't
have a bright future?

497
00:47:42,527 --> 00:47:45,440
Pain or gain, maybe it's for her own good

498
00:47:49,267 --> 00:47:53,670
I've seen the Karna who gets into fights
with seniors and gets suspended from
coflege

499
00:47:53,671 --> 00:47:56,506
Today, I see a new side of you.

500
00:47:56,507 --> 00:48:00,477
I'm not saying that the Karna in college is
wrong.

501
00:48:00,478 --> 00:48:03,584
But you're trying hard to hide the softer
side of you.

502
00:48:06,284 --> 00:48:09,519
Ok, it's a serious subject. I'll think about it.

503
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:11,898
I'm unable to find answers.

504
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:25,240
Oh god, so many messages! I'm just not
able to spend time with my friends.

505
00:48:30,007 --> 00:48:31,008
Ok, I'm ofi for a shower

506
00:48:31,642 --> 00:48:32,709
Dude, that underwear is mine

507
00:48:32,710 --> 00:48:33,586
Ok take!

508
00:48:35,746 --> 00:48:39,049
Did you give it a thought?

509
00:48:39,050 --> 00:48:42,725
I'm still thinking

510
00:48:54,265 --> 00:48:55,539
Where is he?

511
00:48:57,401 --> 00:48:58,675
And the phone?

512
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:04,511
I thought about it.

513
00:49:09,313 --> 00:49:10,180
What?

514
00:49:10,181 --> 00:49:14,960
It there's another side to me, there must be
one to you as well.

515
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:20,620
Why not the both of us get together and
explore that side of you?

516
00:49:21,659 --> 00:49:23,002
Explore??

517
00:49:45,216 --> 00:49:46,649
Ok then.

518
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:51,463
I'm game to find that other side of me. You
do the same.

519
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:58,238
Why have you poured me a drink? I've quit
alcohol.

520
00:50:01,232 --> 00:50:02,404
L'll see you guys later.

521
00:50:04,435 --> 00:50:06,244
Dude, where's the car?

522
00:50:09,607 --> 00:50:12,213
Ok then, let's go out.

523
00:50:18,249 --> 00:50:20,661
At this hour? No way!

524
00:50:27,491 --> 00:50:31,027
There is a way? Jump off the balcony.

525
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:36,028
I meant I can't come out.

526
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:37,374
Where are the car keys?

527
00:50:40,538 --> 00:50:43,707
Not that, not that!

528
00:50:43,708 --> 00:50:46,314
It's in the wash basin

529
00:50:47,545 --> 00:50:50,685
You better get your pockets stitched

530
00:50:51,148 --> 00:50:57,121
I won't take no for an answer. I'm already
outside your house.

531
00:51:11,435 --> 00:51:16,544
Are you crazy? Why did you come here at
this hour?

532
00:51:16,707 --> 00:51:19,409
Hello...why? Didn't I come when you called
me?

533
00:51:19,410 --> 00:51:22,278
Now I'm asking you to come out with me
and you better do so.

534
00:51:22,279 --> 00:51:28,321
Karna, try and understand! It's well past
midnight and I can't come out now.

535
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:30,487
If you don't come out now,

536
00:51:30,488 --> 00:51:33,256
I'm going to blare the horn and wake up
the whole neighbourhood.

537
00:51:33,257 --> 00:51:37,569
No!!!! Don't do that Karna. Please don't
make noise.

538
00:51:38,495 --> 00:51:42,465
All right, for your sake I give up the idea of
honking.

539
00:51:42,466 --> 00:51:44,070
You come down now.

540
00:51:52,676 --> 00:51:54,444
Please concentrate on the road

541
00:51:54,445 --> 00:51:56,516
The road is in bad shape...l don't want to
look at it.

542
00:51:58,415 --> 00:52:01,362
Don't you have the sense to honk at an
intersection?

543
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:05,355
The horn is not working

544
00:52:05,356 --> 00:52:08,258
Are you joking?

545
00:52:08,259 --> 00:52:10,427
Do you know what my dad will do if he gets
to know of this...?

546
00:52:10,428 --> 00:52:12,271
What? ls he going to repair it for me?

547
00:52:14,598 --> 00:52:16,271
So where are we going now?

548
00:52:17,134 --> 00:52:18,636
To eat some corn

549
00:52:23,474 --> 00:52:25,476
Karna, have you ever come here before?

550
00:52:26,510 --> 00:52:28,148
Why will I come to an unknown place?

551
00:52:29,447 --> 00:52:30,926
Actually, on a highway...

552
00:52:33,183 --> 00:52:35,322
Thought I fell down? I went to pluck some
corn.

553
00:52:35,853 --> 00:52:38,299
Kama, I'm getting scared...

554
00:52:38,556 --> 00:52:41,537
we have trespassed somebody's
field...what if we get caught?

555
00:52:42,493 --> 00:52:43,836
I got another one

556
00:52:47,331 --> 00:52:48,833
Karna, tell me about your family...

557
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:53,243
My family comrprises me, my father and
grandfather. Just the three of us.

558
00:52:53,537 --> 00:52:54,447
And your mother?

559
00:52:54,872 --> 00:52:56,545
I don't remember her at all

560
00:52:59,977 --> 00:53:01,650
What does your dad do?

561
00:53:02,546 --> 00:53:04,214
He's a don.

562
00:53:04,215 --> 00:53:06,855
Long ago, he would take to the streets with
his tights.

563
00:53:07,384 --> 00:53:09,591
Now he's old. So he plays chess at home.

564
00:53:11,355 --> 00:53:13,956
Let alone my father, you should hear my
grandpa's tales...

565
00:53:13,957 --> 00:53:15,630
you'll be shocked.

566
00:53:15,826 --> 00:53:17,464
Is he such a terror?

567
00:53:17,995 --> 00:53:20,737
March 28. 1946.

568
00:53:21,398 --> 00:53:22,900
Maybe past 5 in the evening.

569
00:53:23,367 --> 00:53:26,002
He went to a street cart to eat pakodas.

570
00:53:26,003 --> 00:53:28,438
And while he was eating the pakodas,

571
00:53:28,439 --> 00:53:29,941
he asked for extra chutney.

572
00:53:30,407 --> 00:53:31,941
The vendor refused

573
00:53:31,942 --> 00:53:33,609
My grandpa wouldn't take no for an
answer.

574
00:53:33,610 --> 00:53:35,283
The vendor said he was out of chutney.

575
00:53:35,646 --> 00:53:37,319
My grandpa volunteered to help him with
the grinding for the chutney,

576
00:53:37,514 --> 00:53:41,929
but instead went on to beat him to a pulp
instead.

577
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:45,723
In the midst of all this,

578
00:53:46,223 --> 00:53:48,430
a British officer came to break up the fight.

579
00:53:48,792 --> 00:53:51,864
He yelled at them to stop which my
grandpa mistook for a cuss word.

580
00:53:52,496 --> 00:53:53,440
That's it.

581
00:53:53,497 --> 00:53:58,378
He shifted focus to the officer and thrashed
him like a dog.

582
00:53:58,936 --> 00:54:02,975
The villagers who witnessed this scene
labelled my grandpa a freedom lighter.

583
00:54:03,841 --> 00:54:06,481
Happy that he'd receive pension, my
grandpa complied with the label.

584
00:54:06,810 --> 00:54:08,483
Here eat the corn.

585
00:54:08,979 --> 00:54:10,617
Good story.

586
00:54:19,690 --> 00:54:21,363
Is that an elephant?

587
00:54:24,862 --> 00:54:25,863
No way!

588
00:54:26,697 --> 00:54:28,973
True. How can an elephant come here?

589
00:54:38,409 --> 00:54:39,911
It sounds like it is an elephant.

590
00:54:42,513 --> 00:54:44,015
Ok, I think it is an elephant.

591
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:52,829
Saanvi, why are you scared?

592
00:54:52,890 --> 00:54:54,528
Elephants are harmless.

593
00:54:57,461 --> 00:54:58,940
Don't run...it won't harm us.

594
00:55:05,469 --> 00:55:08,507
What a silly girl you are! Getting scared of
an elephant, that toot!

595
00:55:19,550 --> 00:55:22,690
Saanvi, can you accompany me till there?

596
00:55:37,735 --> 00:55:39,408
Two teas please...

597
00:55:39,970 --> 00:55:41,643
and a cigarette for me

598
00:55:46,777 --> 00:55:50,350
Oh, how of foolish of me...l've quit
smoking! Cancel that cigarette.

599
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:58,793
You haven't told me anything about your
family...

600
00:55:59,523 --> 00:56:01,025
We don't have an exciting history like your
family...

601
00:56:04,028 --> 00:56:07,635
My father is strict, but that's okay. He's a
cop after all!

602
00:56:08,632 --> 00:56:10,134
You should bribe him and get your way.

603
00:56:14,938 --> 00:56:16,178
Is he extremely strict?

604
00:56:17,741 --> 00:56:20,449
Not really...he's a nice guy.

605
00:56:20,844 --> 00:56:23,947
A little short tempered and says things he
doesn't mean when he's angry.

606
00:56:23,948 --> 00:56:25,621
And that hurts sometimes.

607
00:56:26,416 --> 00:56:27,918
How do you deal with hurt?

608
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:30,962
I go to church

609
00:56:31,888 --> 00:56:32,730
And when you're happy?

610
00:56:33,123 --> 00:56:33,897
I go to church

611
00:56:35,025 --> 00:56:36,698
Come let's go there

612
00:56:37,995 --> 00:56:38,735
At this hour?

613
00:56:45,602 --> 00:56:47,136
<i>Sam, doth worry.</i>

614
00:56:47,137 --> 00:56:50,778
I'll be your safety net. Come here... jump!

615
00:56:52,876 --> 00:56:53,547
Let's go')?

616
00:56:56,747 --> 00:56:59,148
Kama, let's climb the church tower?

617
00:56:59,149 --> 00:57:00,457
Okay, let's climb!

618
00:57:07,524 --> 00:57:09,003
Hey! What are you doing?

619
00:57:09,126 --> 00:57:10,127
Haven't we come here to ring the bell?

620
00:57:10,194 --> 00:57:13,004
Are you crazy? The whole neighbourhood
will be up.

621
00:57:13,564 --> 00:57:14,406
It's 5am.

622
00:57:16,033 --> 00:57:17,706
See they're already praying aloud,

623
00:57:17,901 --> 00:57:19,539
so why don't we ring the bell too?

624
00:57:25,843 --> 00:57:28,824
As we mature, so do our thoughts, isn't it?

625
00:57:30,681 --> 00:57:35,255
You start thinking that you're mature and
beyond childish behaviour.

626
00:57:35,886 --> 00:57:38,594
We try to hide all our childish desires.

627
00:57:40,657 --> 00:57:43,831
All those tun things we did tonight, has
made me feel like a child again.

628
00:57:46,597 --> 00:57:47,632
Okay so shall I ring the bell?

629
00:58:01,879 --> 00:58:06,515
As they sway gently on a swing,

630
00:58:06,516 --> 00:58:11,516
Krishna and Radhe are lost in their
moment

631
00:58:12,289 --> 00:58:17,289
As Krishna whispers sweet nothings into
her ears,

632
00:58:17,895 --> 00:58:22,895
Shyness overwhelms Radhe

633
00:58:23,233 --> 00:58:28,233
As he entwines the edge of her sari with
his finger,

634
00:58:29,006 --> 00:58:34,006
while caressing her lustrous hair,

635
00:58:34,945 --> 00:58:39,945
Igniting her senses,

636
00:58:40,584 --> 00:58:45,584
he raises her coy face towards him

637
00:58:45,789 --> 00:58:53,765
As they sway gently on a swing,

638
00:59:05,108 --> 00:59:10,108
Gently placing his ears to her heart

639
00:59:10,647 --> 00:59:15,647
And wrapping her in a warm embrace,

640
00:59:16,153 --> 00:59:21,153
As he lovingly runs his fingers on her lips
to catch the unspoken words

641
00:59:21,325 --> 00:59:26,325
She answers with a soft sigh

642
00:59:27,030 --> 00:59:32,030
As she begins to bare her soul to him

643
00:59:33,070 --> 00:59:38,007
The universe witnessed this union

644
00:59:38,008 --> 00:59:43,008
Her lips began to quiver...

645
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:49,080
having experienced a sweet moment

646
00:59:49,386 --> 00:59:54,386
As Krishna and Radhe swayed gently on a
swing,

647
00:59:55,125 --> 00:59:57,628
Saanvi, you forgot my shin

648
00:59:58,628 --> 01:00:00,130
I won't give it back.

649
01:00:30,394 --> 01:00:32,169
If we try, I'm sure we can fit in dude.

650
01:00:32,429 --> 01:00:34,238
Will it just be the two of us?

651
01:00:47,210 --> 01:00:49,918
Ladies Hostel! Their farewell party is on..

652
01:00:54,318 --> 01:00:57,356
If the ladies get to know we're here, they'll
celebrate our arrival!

653
01:00:59,956 --> 01:01:02,925
Dude! I'll go ahead and check if the coast
is clear.

654
01:01:02,926 --> 01:01:05,236
If it is, I'll come and fetch you guys.

655
01:01:52,809 --> 01:01:55,881
Who is this handsome young man...

656
01:01:56,146 --> 01:01:59,491
who has stealthily made his way here at
the right hour?

657
01:02:00,317 --> 01:02:03,161
Jumping over the fence, spreading smiles,

658
01:02:03,753 --> 01:02:06,962
he has been drawn here like a butterfly is
to a garden

659
01:02:07,424 --> 01:02:10,428
I lost my way and wound up here

660
01:02:14,498 --> 01:02:18,002
This Tom cat slipped up and landed in our
midst

661
01:02:22,005 --> 01:02:24,918
Where has my gang of boys disappeared?

662
01:02:25,842 --> 01:02:28,015
Where the hell are they having left me
behind?

663
01:02:29,145 --> 01:02:32,217
Once you've come and been held captive
here,

664
01:02:33,116 --> 01:02:35,460
do you think you can escape easily?

665
01:03:09,552 --> 01:03:13,289
We are really sorry.

666
01:03:13,290 --> 01:03:16,965
We will not be swayed by your false praise

667
01:03:17,394 --> 01:03:19,931
We can pay a fine if you want

668
01:03:21,064 --> 01:03:24,136
Enough with your fake stories

669
01:03:24,835 --> 01:03:28,204
Somebody please help and bring me
down...

670
01:03:28,205 --> 01:03:30,947
please offer some help..

671
01:03:32,275 --> 01:03:35,256
How can we send away a guest so rare
without honouring him?

672
01:03:35,912 --> 01:03:38,085
We will see him ofi with special honours

673
01:03:38,815 --> 01:03:41,091
Isn't this a little extreme?

674
01:03:42,619 --> 01:03:46,123
Do you want to see a different a facet of
us?

675
01:03:46,389 --> 01:03:49,625
You're a group of bluffmasters. Why do you
take unnecessary pride in it?

676
01:03:49,626 --> 01:03:53,369
Beware we know how to deal with guys like
you.

677
01:04:56,192 --> 01:04:59,969
Don't exceed your limits...

678
01:05:00,897 --> 01:05:03,699
You stay silent and mind your own
business

679
01:05:03,700 --> 01:05:07,477
You think you own this place?

680
01:05:08,004 --> 01:05:10,917
Please don't worry, we think nothing of that
son

681
01:05:11,608 --> 01:05:14,919
Don't cross your limits and act oversman

682
01:05:18,648 --> 01:05:22,460
We make our own course just like the wind

683
01:05:26,222 --> 01:05:29,601
Your spirits are high with all the booze
you've had

684
01:05:30,060 --> 01:05:32,597
It's high time you leave now

685
01:05:33,463 --> 01:05:36,273
We have troubled you enough for tonight

686
01:05:37,133 --> 01:05:39,511
We shall see you in college tomorrow...

687
01:05:49,579 --> 01:05:51,456
Dude, you gave us away!

688
01:06:00,423 --> 01:06:05,423
(Senior abusing Kama with the choicest
words)

689
01:06:11,701 --> 01:06:13,647
Guys, shut up!

690
01:06:18,541 --> 01:06:21,954
Hello! Don't you have any respect for your
seniors?

691
01:06:22,312 --> 01:06:26,124
Not only are you hitting on a girl from our
class,
but you also beat up a boy from our class,
too.

692
01:06:27,450 --> 01:06:29,487
I'll finish you off in the first year itself!

693
01:06:30,687 --> 01:06:33,133
What are you staring at?

694
01:06:33,390 --> 01:06:35,267
You think you're a hero?

695
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:52,181
You're all in the final year.

696
01:06:53,209 --> 01:06:55,655
Once you pass out, don't you dare step in
to the campus for the next three years.

697
01:07:00,817 --> 01:07:02,718
Why? Because I will still be in this college

698
01:07:02,719 --> 01:07:05,320
<i>Kama, what happened?</i>

699
01:07:05,321 --> 01:07:07,995
Tell us...

700
01:07:28,778 --> 01:07:31,280
Saanvi, what are you writing? ls it about
Kama?

701
01:07:31,281 --> 01:07:33,582
Neetu! Come here, take this diary!

702
01:07:33,583 --> 01:07:34,817
Neetu, please give it back!

703
01:07:34,818 --> 01:07:36,852
Don t give it to her, give it here!

704
01:07:36,853 --> 01:07:38,420
Will it just be the two of us?

705
01:07:38,421 --> 01:07:40,298
Are you writing about Kama?

706
01:07:41,191 --> 01:07:44,195
(Breaks into popular Kannada film song)

707
01:07:45,228 --> 01:07:48,641
(Breaks into popular Kannada film song)

708
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:52,801
So what if he's a junior?

709
01:07:52,802 --> 01:07:55,476
Sachin Tendulkar is 6 years junior to his
wife!

710
01:07:57,707 --> 01:07:59,846
Let's all raise a toast and celebrate
Saanvi's new found love.

711
01:08:00,477 --> 01:08:02,144
No way, I don't want a drink.

712
01:08:02,145 --> 01:08:04,380
It's a big deal that I've got permission to
stay in the hostel.

713
01:08:04,381 --> 01:08:07,516
Oh shut up. <i>2</i> months is all we have left of
college life.

714
01:08:07,517 --> 01:08:09,360
Who knows where each of us will be after
that?

715
01:08:11,487 --> 01:08:15,524
Saanvi, please don't give us excuses.
We're all drinking today and that's final.

716
01:08:15,525 --> 01:08:17,426
I've never had a drink before..

717
01:08:17,427 --> 01:08:20,636
As ii we drink everyday! This is our first
time too.

718
01:08:20,830 --> 01:08:21,830
What?!!

719
01:08:21,831 --> 01:08:23,105
Okay fine...

720
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:26,407
may be the second or third time.

721
01:08:38,248 --> 01:08:40,626
Another peg and she'll spill out all her
secrets.

722
01:08:41,184 --> 01:08:42,629
Okay enough, I'll pour the drink myself.

723
01:08:49,392 --> 01:08:51,736
Okay that's it. I'm not saying anything
more.

724
01:09:20,990 --> 01:09:22,190
What happened?

725
01:09:22,191 --> 01:09:23,225
Even I don't know

726
01:09:23,226 --> 01:09:24,671
They are not letting anyone go that side

727
01:09:25,662 --> 01:09:30,662
(Tension prevails)

728
01:09:45,648 --> 01:09:49,323
Apparently she got drunk and fell off the
third floor.

729
01:09:49,685 --> 01:09:51,453
How did you get to know?

730
01:09:51,454 --> 01:09:53,661
Tanu called me

731
01:11:21,678 --> 01:11:22,679
Look Karna's there..

732
01:11:23,580 --> 01:11:24,880
<i>Kama, what happened'?</i>

733
01:11:24,881 --> 01:11:29,881
(A funeral ceremony is in progress)

734
01:12:06,889 --> 01:12:09,392
Karna's alone, come lets go to him.

735
01:12:25,508 --> 01:12:26,851
That's Saanvi's father.

736
01:13:16,392 --> 01:13:17,393
I'm sorry

737
01:13:17,861 --> 01:13:20,467
The reputation of your college has been
tarnished because of my daughter.

738
01:13:46,689 --> 01:13:51,604
For god's sake! Can you please stop
watching that video on repeat?!

739
01:13:52,629 --> 01:13:56,736
For the misfortune of being her parent,
I've fulfilled my obligations and completed
her last rites.

740
01:13:57,133 --> 01:13:59,613
Don't ever speak of her again.

741
01:14:35,705 --> 01:14:36,738
Sir, look at this clip.

742
01:14:36,739 --> 01:14:40,108
Oh this girl! I've seen her roaming the
streets at night with some boy.

743
01:14:40,109 --> 01:14:40,712
Oh this girl! I've seen her roaming the
streets at night with some boy.

744
01:14:41,511 --> 01:14:48,986
O tongue that is spinning malicious lies
I'm now consumed by the anger to split
you into two

745
01:14:50,119 --> 01:14:52,621
Serves her right for drinking...

746
01:14:52,622 --> 01:14:55,603
Dude, I've seen this video. Do you have
more videos of her?

747
01:14:56,559 --> 01:15:02,908
When I see people shaming you, my blood
boils with anger

748
01:15:21,517 --> 01:15:23,895
O tongue that is spinning malicious lies

749
01:15:24,287 --> 01:15:27,956
I'm now consumed by the anger to split
you into two

750
01:15:27,957 --> 01:15:28,724
Kama, open the door!

751
01:15:28,725 --> 01:15:36,769
When I see people shaming you, my blood
boils with anger

752
01:15:46,843 --> 01:15:49,711
Guys, look at the notice board, our Julie
miss is on it!

753
01:15:49,712 --> 01:15:53,888
An obituary for a person who fell off the
building after getting high on alcohol!
Come guys!

754
01:15:55,618 --> 01:15:57,319
She'd come whenever I called her.

755
01:15:57,320 --> 01:15:58,887
So she's had a drink with you, too?

756
01:15:58,888 --> 01:16:02,624
Ask me what I haven't done with her?

757
01:16:02,625 --> 01:16:06,361
A lie stays hidden, like the embers within
the ashes

758
01:16:06,362 --> 01:16:10,231
Like a desire that stays, just like the smoke
after tire

759
01:16:10,232 --> 01:16:14,069
A man who has no grip over his tongue is
heartless, too

760
01:16:14,070 --> 01:16:18,018
I'll ensure your shadow is not spared from
the hands of death

761
01:17:13,129 --> 01:17:16,865
The circus that ensues among the ugly
minds who fall prey to empty lies

762
01:17:16,866 --> 01:17:20,871
It's time to separate truth from the lies

763
01:17:28,311 --> 01:17:32,214
For you burn with jealousy when goodness
abounds

764
01:17:32,215 --> 01:17:36,151
Even at the hour of death, you will not let
go of your malicious ways

765
01:17:36,152 --> 01:17:39,888
Do not spare such evil souls, take them
away from here O lord

766
01:17:39,889 --> 01:17:43,996
And while you make excuses, you have no
reason to live

767
01:17:55,171 --> 01:17:58,206
O tongue that is spinning malicious lies

768
01:17:58,207 --> 01:18:02,777
I'm now consumed by the anger to split
you into two

769
01:18:02,778 --> 01:18:10,253
When I see people shaming you, my blood
boils with anger

770
01:18:17,927 --> 01:18:21,763
The ones who burn with jealousy will turn
into ashes themselves

771
01:18:21,764 --> 01:18:25,533
The ones boiling with rage, will themselves
evaporate

772
01:18:25,534 --> 01:18:29,304
The sins are not the ones committed, but
uttered

773
01:18:29,305 --> 01:18:33,378
So when you have done wrong, be
prepared to face the wrong

774
01:18:33,910 --> 01:18:35,912
Beware, just look behind, it's coming after
you...

775
01:18:38,447 --> 01:18:43,447
You will be entangled in the web of your
own sins

776
01:18:46,489 --> 01:18:50,460
You have to give an account for every dirty
game you've played

777
01:18:51,761 --> 01:18:53,502
So come, face your reality...

778
01:19:07,376 --> 01:19:11,379
I am here to destroy the fortress of
falsehood

779
01:19:11,380 --> 01:19:15,260
So come, gear up for a fight

780
01:21:31,186 --> 01:21:33,922
Here's a warning to all the students who've
come to our college from other institutions.

781
01:21:33,923 --> 01:21:35,023
Listen carefully

782
01:21:35,024 --> 01:21:37,292
You've come here to panicipate in our
function

783
01:21:37,293 --> 01:21:39,295
stick to participating and watching the
programmes..

784
01:21:39,361 --> 01:21:40,897
And take home a prize if you win.

785
01:21:41,530 --> 01:21:44,632
But it I hear of anyone teasing our female
students,

786
01:21:44,633 --> 01:21:47,614
the programme will keep getting
interrupted.

787
01:21:48,937 --> 01:21:51,973
The cultural programme will now continue.

788
01:21:51,974 --> 01:21:53,078
What were you guys performing?

789
01:21:56,045 --> 01:21:57,524
Ok...continue...

790
01:22:13,596 --> 01:22:14,631
Don't you have any sense?

791
01:22:15,331 --> 01:22:16,401
She's crying

792
01:22:16,665 --> 01:22:17,939
I can see...that!

793
01:22:18,734 --> 01:22:19,508
If somebody comes...

794
01:22:21,570 --> 01:22:22,742
stop your peHormanceL...

795
01:22:25,174 --> 01:22:27,552
If you face any problem, don't you have the
sense to come and inform us about it?

796
01:22:28,010 --> 01:22:29,318
What are we seniors around for?

797
01:22:30,546 --> 01:22:32,150
What are you staring at? Console her.

798
01:22:33,148 --> 01:22:34,983
Please be consoled!

799
01:22:34,984 --> 01:22:35,985
<i>OK enough</i>

800
01:22:36,252 --> 01:22:37,026
Ok

801
01:22:37,486 --> 01:22:39,754
I was to myself.

802
01:22:39,755 --> 01:22:41,564
He was the one who came and troubled
me

803
01:22:43,392 --> 01:22:45,126
You duffer, say it Kannada.

804
01:22:45,127 --> 01:22:46,994
Don't you know the language??

805
01:22:46,995 --> 01:22:48,440
I didn't speak to you, shut up!

806
01:22:48,731 --> 01:22:50,431
He was extremely rude...

807
01:22:50,432 --> 01:22:53,242
All I asked him was, "why don't you speak
in Kannada?"

808
01:22:57,339 --> 01:22:59,114
You arrived on the scene by then.

809
01:23:08,050 --> 01:23:08,585
Ok

810
01:23:09,485 --> 01:23:11,055
please ensure that it doesn't repeat again
Ok...

811
01:23:11,320 --> 01:23:12,628
continue with your performance

812
01:23:13,189 --> 01:23:22,268
(Performance to Raghavendra Rajkumafls
hit song)

813
01:23:39,148 --> 01:23:40,715
Don't bother trying to catch Karna's
attention.

814
01:23:40,716 --> 01:23:42,650
He hasn't looked at a girl in 3 years.

815
01:23:42,651 --> 01:23:45,286
That's 0k... I'll adjust

816
01:23:45,287 --> 01:23:47,563
He hasn't shaved in ages!

817
01:23:48,123 --> 01:23:50,224
I don't care! I love it

818
01:23:50,225 --> 01:23:51,793
He's extremely short tempered

819
01:23:51,794 --> 01:23:54,562
That's ok. He'll change once we get
married!

820
01:23:54,563 --> 01:23:56,764
Married? What do you even know about
him?

821
01:23:56,765 --> 01:23:58,533
I know his entire history

822
01:23:58,534 --> 01:24:02,637
How can anyone not know?
Everybody knows how he had become
after Saanvfs death.

823
01:24:02,638 --> 01:24:04,706
It was us who helped him get over the
tragedy.

824
01:24:04,707 --> 01:24:06,574
And now he's acting smart with us!

825
01:24:06,575 --> 01:24:08,376
It was these boys who showed Kama
attitude

826
01:24:08,377 --> 01:24:10,545
Because they were Computer Science
students and Karna was in Mechanical

827
01:24:10,546 --> 01:24:13,615
Didn't Karna involve these boys when he
conducted that fest last year?

828
01:24:13,616 --> 01:24:17,085
Yes, he involved us. But Kama and his
boys pocketed all the profits.

829
01:24:17,086 --> 01:24:19,327
All lies!

830
01:24:19,388 --> 01:24:21,231
People never speak the truth

831
01:24:21,824 --> 01:24:23,157
Kama can never be wrong.

832
01:24:23,158 --> 01:24:25,293
If he can do no wrong, then why did Kama
keep the car?

833
01:24:25,294 --> 01:24:27,495
Didn't we all pitch in with money to buy it?

834
01:24:27,496 --> 01:24:29,364
But he's cleared all their dues

835
01:24:29,365 --> 01:24:31,538
My foot! He hasn't cleared anything! He
still has two pending papers.

836
01:24:32,501 --> 01:24:35,736
According to the rules, he isn't eligible to
contest elections.

837
01:24:35,737 --> 01:24:38,206
That is the reason why Karna got the
elections canceled.

838
01:24:38,207 --> 01:24:40,881
They let him contest the elections because
of the ruckus he created.

839
01:24:41,410 --> 01:24:44,112
It was because of Karna that even the fest
was held much before elections.

840
01:24:44,113 --> 01:24:46,753
Elections can be held at any time. But
Kama is bound to win it.

841
01:24:47,483 --> 01:24:49,150
Anybody can win if they resort to
goondagHL.

842
01:24:49,151 --> 01:24:50,685
That is what Karna has been doing all
these years.

843
01:24:50,686 --> 01:24:51,786
Do you remember what happened last
year?

844
01:24:51,787 --> 01:24:56,236
He got us beaten up because we
supported the students from ou r branch.

845
01:24:58,093 --> 01:24:59,293
He didn't even care that we were his
friends...

846
01:24:59,294 --> 01:25:00,795
He didn't care that they were his friends.

847
01:25:00,796 --> 01:25:02,537
You should have been there!

848
01:25:04,700 --> 01:25:06,200
You should have been there.

849
01:25:06,201 --> 01:25:07,135
Were you there?

850
01:25:07,136 --> 01:25:08,436
Those who witnessed the fight, told me

851
01:25:08,437 --> 01:25:11,239
No matter what anybody says, we
shouldn't spare Karna this time.

852
01:25:11,240 --> 01:25:14,375
Let it all be done face to face...this time
both of us are standing for elections.

853
01:25:14,376 --> 01:25:16,322
And no matter what, we have to win this
election.

854
01:25:18,514 --> 01:25:19,947
What's up Sankoch!

855
01:25:19,948 --> 01:25:22,121
Who are you voting for this time?

856
01:25:22,551 --> 01:25:25,220
Dude, both Kama and you are good friends
of mine

857
01:25:25,221 --> 01:25:27,428
So I've decided to not vote this time.

858
01:25:29,425 --> 01:25:30,733
Are the designs okay?

859
01:25:30,893 --> 01:25:32,236
Please excuse me...

860
01:25:36,532 --> 01:25:39,103
What's up guys...you've used a bench as
your party symbol!

861
01:25:42,705 --> 01:25:43,843
Tell them to print this.

862
01:25:45,274 --> 01:25:46,184
It's not just a bench...

863
01:25:48,243 --> 01:25:51,479
We belong to the last bench party

864
01:25:51,480 --> 01:25:54,749
We don't need anyone's permission for we
are the rulers here

865
01:25:54,750 --> 01:25:59,750
Set the stage for us and keep the whistles
coming

866
01:26:00,222 --> 01:26:01,633
We are set to make our entry

867
01:26:02,424 --> 01:26:03,291
Let's begin campaigning

868
01:26:03,292 --> 01:26:04,896
yes, there are just two weeks left for
elections

869
01:26:05,527 --> 01:26:07,700
When compared to us, there are more
students in Computer Science

870
01:26:08,430 --> 01:26:11,138
Moreover, they have lS's support, so let's
not risk it

871
01:26:26,882 --> 01:26:27,656
Ah...

872
01:26:27,983 --> 01:26:30,224
so you've come to tell me to withdraw from
the elections?

873
01:26:58,013 --> 01:27:00,615
Oh, was a class going on here?

874
01:27:00,616 --> 01:27:03,684
That's ok! He was my classmate at one
point!

875
01:27:03,685 --> 01:27:05,286
Come Surru, let's go out.

876
01:27:05,287 --> 01:27:06,253
They want to campaign for the elections.

877
01:27:06,254 --> 01:27:07,889
Dude, I'm a lecturer now!

878
01:27:07,890 --> 01:27:08,527
Oops, sorry.

879
01:27:08,590 --> 01:27:09,660
Ok guys, listen up...

880
01:27:10,559 --> 01:27:12,869
Dude, look at Karna's party symbol...it's the
last bench!

881
01:27:14,329 --> 01:27:16,309
Shows the standards of the Mechanical
boys!

882
01:27:16,899 --> 01:27:17,932
But we are Computer Science boys

883
01:27:17,933 --> 01:27:19,810
our symbol should be of corporate
standards.

884
01:27:21,537 --> 01:27:23,244
What about an apple?

885
01:27:23,538 --> 01:27:24,983
They'll think we've copied a brand

886
01:27:25,641 --> 01:27:26,642
Dude, what about a pineapple?

887
01:27:27,342 --> 01:27:29,549
What a brilliant idea!

888
01:27:30,412 --> 01:27:33,648
Colouriul personalities are now set to
become leaders in white

889
01:27:33,649 --> 01:27:37,084
Speeches are on the tip our tongues

890
01:27:37,085 --> 01:27:40,721
Pandals have been rented

891
01:27:40,722 --> 01:27:43,591
As we sit inside smoking,

892
01:27:43,592 --> 01:27:47,039
we await the fruits of our labour

893
01:27:56,572 --> 01:27:58,339
So who are we voting for?

894
01:27:58,340 --> 01:27:59,978
The last bench party!

895
01:28:00,542 --> 01:28:03,386
Please vote for us

896
01:28:04,680 --> 01:28:07,524
We are not liers, we live by our word

897
01:28:07,749 --> 01:28:10,923
Get set to rejoice for victory will be ours.

898
01:28:11,320 --> 01:28:14,529
Worry not, we might be in the ruling seat,
but the rules will be yours

899
01:28:34,509 --> 01:28:36,386
It's so cold...warm yourselves...

900
01:29:17,920 --> 01:29:20,526
Move! Kama, where are you going??

901
01:29:23,592 --> 01:29:25,162
Ok, Loki is definitely winning this election.

902
01:29:33,401 --> 01:29:34,744
He's been gone for three days now.

903
01:29:35,103 --> 01:29:36,737
Not even answering his phone.

904
01:29:36,738 --> 01:29:38,639
God alone knows where he is!

905
01:29:38,640 --> 01:29:40,841
As though he's done this for the first time!

906
01:29:40,842 --> 01:29:42,510
This is what he does always.

907
01:29:42,511 --> 01:29:45,813
There have been times when he's come
back after four weeks.

908
01:29:45,814 --> 01:29:48,988
But this time, ii he doesn't come back
before elections, what do we do?

909
01:29:51,520 --> 01:29:53,087
<i>Kama, where were you'?</i>

910
01:29:53,088 --> 01:29:54,522
Do you know how tensed we were?

911
01:29:54,523 --> 01:29:56,190
How could you go away at such a crucial
time?

912
01:29:56,191 --> 01:29:58,102
It will be humiliating ii we lose this election.

913
01:30:00,896 --> 01:30:04,207
Dude, don't take this election lightly. The
situation is quite serious.

914
01:30:04,700 --> 01:30:07,510
Do you know what Loki and his gang were
up to in your absence?

915
01:30:08,437 --> 01:30:15,855
They've spread rumours that the candidate
is missing
even though elections are around the
corner...

916
01:30:17,179 --> 01:30:20,490
Candidates going missing during elections
is common

917
01:30:29,925 --> 01:30:33,694
Sporting sunglasses and wearing his
attitude

918
01:30:33,695 --> 01:30:36,505
Let's be on our way and do the victory lap

919
01:30:43,939 --> 01:30:46,749
Without any distinction of grade or rank,
come vote for us

920
01:30:47,142 --> 01:30:50,680
We are going to win anyway, so ready the
cut-outs

921
01:30:57,653 --> 01:30:59,653
All of you sing it once again

922
01:30:59,654 --> 01:31:02,498
We belong to the last bench party

923
01:31:02,958 --> 01:31:05,802
We don't need anyone's permission for we
are the rulers here

924
01:31:06,228 --> 01:31:09,072
Set the stage for us

925
01:31:09,831 --> 01:31:12,675
and keep the whistles coming for we are
set to make our entry

926
01:31:13,068 --> 01:31:15,936
We've made our presence felt already

927
01:31:15,937 --> 01:31:19,783
Our attitude stands tall

928
01:31:41,596 --> 01:31:42,631
Silence please.

929
01:31:43,932 --> 01:31:48,074
The Last Bench party has won the election
this time.

930
01:31:49,571 --> 01:31:56,284
Karna will be taking oath as the president
at 10 am tomorrow.

931
01:31:59,047 --> 01:32:05,521
Greetings to all the students

932
01:32:06,688 --> 01:32:11,797
and the dignitaries present on today's
occasion.

933
01:32:13,061 --> 01:32:16,975
Who's that...please maintain silence!

934
01:32:17,632 --> 01:32:20,772
I'll come to you, too.

935
01:32:32,314 --> 01:32:37,314
The reason such a massive crowd has
gathered here is because

936
01:32:40,155 --> 01:32:47,972
a golden moment is set to be witnessed by
you all.

937
01:32:48,196 --> 01:32:50,231
It's 9.45 am! Where the hell is Kama?

938
01:32:50,232 --> 01:32:54,835
I request the party workers to not lose
patience.

939
01:32:54,836 --> 01:32:57,976
He's on his way...friends,

940
01:33:09,217 --> 01:33:11,254
Dear voters,

941
01:33:12,120 --> 01:33:17,900
our beloved youth icon

942
01:33:19,294 --> 01:33:21,035
messiah of the poor

943
01:33:22,064 --> 01:33:23,771
champion of the environment

944
01:33:24,599 --> 01:33:25,634
Kama...

945
01:33:26,034 --> 01:33:28,014
Where is Kama?

946
01:33:28,603 --> 01:33:30,776
He'll be here any moment...

947
01:33:47,922 --> 01:33:48,832
What's up guys?

948
01:33:49,424 --> 01:33:50,658
Off to play cricket?

949
01:33:50,659 --> 01:33:51,763
Why? You want to join us?

950
01:33:59,100 --> 01:34:00,010
Play well.

951
01:34:06,941 --> 01:34:09,854
From the time of the Mahabharata, Karna
has always been back-stabbed.

952
01:34:11,813 --> 01:34:14,293
On second thoughts, let's play the match.

953
01:34:23,125 --> 01:34:25,959
The swashbuckling batsman has arrived at
the pitch.

954
01:34:25,960 --> 01:34:28,099
And he faces the first ball.

955
01:34:29,965 --> 01:34:31,000
Excellent shot

956
01:34:32,801 --> 01:34:34,974
He opens his innings with four runs.

957
01:34:41,176 --> 01:34:43,281
Wide ball...one run

958
01:34:46,281 --> 01:34:48,148
Scores a biggie.

959
01:34:48,149 --> 01:34:51,218
It's a six and the score card reads 10.

960
01:34:51,219 --> 01:34:51,458
Sir.

961
01:34:52,454 --> 01:34:53,728
It's 11!

962
01:34:54,823 --> 01:34:56,461
There was a wide.

963
01:35:00,862 --> 01:35:02,364
Total now stands at 11

964
01:35:05,800 --> 01:35:08,936
Powerplay is on. All fielders are within 15
yards.

965
01:35:08,937 --> 01:35:10,917
A perfect setting for a thrilling game.

966
01:35:18,847 --> 01:35:22,454
Beautiful shot. Ball is racing towards the
boundary and so is the captain.

967
01:35:32,794 --> 01:35:34,205
Failed attempt at stumping.

968
01:35:35,330 --> 01:35:37,139
The wicket keeper himself is stumped!

969
01:35:40,802 --> 01:35:45,842
Total score...37, 38, boundary...so 42

970
01:35:47,375 --> 01:35:49,377
Defensive play by the opponents...

971
01:35:50,211 --> 01:35:52,191
Dismal performance by the skipper.

972
01:36:09,931 --> 01:36:13,003
Excellent dive that has stopped the fielder
in his tracks.

973
01:36:16,171 --> 01:36:19,345
The ball has raced towards the boundary,
the score stands at 46

974
01:36:20,008 --> 01:36:20,816
What happened?

975
01:36:26,381 --> 01:36:28,088
And its a tailed attempt at a spin...

976
01:36:30,451 --> 01:36:32,152
The ball has crosed the boundary

977
01:36:32,153 --> 01:36:34,827
And the batsman reaches his 50

978
01:36:37,058 --> 01:36:38,264
The crowd cheers him on

979
01:36:40,862 --> 01:36:41,932
52

980
01:36:43,031 --> 01:36:44,298
53

981
01:36:44,299 --> 01:36:46,466
Arial

982
01:36:46,467 --> 01:36:47,134
54

983
01:36:47,135 --> 01:36:48,113
55

984
01:36:52,440 --> 01:36:55,284
Four more runs while the opponent is run
down

985
01:37:01,082 --> 01:37:04,218
The batsman nears his century,
the presure is now on the fielders

986
01:37:04,219 --> 01:37:05,152
93

987
01:37:05,153 --> 01:37:06,220
94

988
01:37:06,221 --> 01:37:08,030
95

989
01:37:41,222 --> 01:37:43,690
Lack of concentration

990
01:37:43,691 --> 01:37:48,572
leaves the batsman retired hurt just short
of scoring a century

991
01:38:05,146 --> 01:38:07,023
Guys run!

992
01:38:43,651 --> 01:38:45,255
Give me a matchbox

993
01:38:49,591 --> 01:38:51,195
Give me a matchbox

994
01:38:57,632 --> 01:39:01,546
Look here, we've arrived at his room.
Please don't keep blabbering.

995
01:39:02,070 --> 01:39:04,983
The situation is very serious. Please be
quiet.

996
01:39:05,506 --> 01:39:06,484
Ok

997
01:39:07,142 --> 01:39:07,586
Show!

998
01:39:08,476 --> 01:39:09,648
You've lost.

999
01:39:21,422 --> 01:39:24,057
I came here to enquire Karna's health.

1000
01:39:24,058 --> 01:39:28,006
I forgot I had to leave ever since we began
playing cards.

1001
01:39:28,663 --> 01:39:31,665
Please give this fruit to Karna, okay?

1002
01:39:31,666 --> 01:39:35,478
Please stay Ghouse. What will you do
going home? Sit down.

1003
01:39:38,139 --> 01:39:41,586
How many times do I have to warn you to
not steal glucose from the next room?

1004
01:39:42,343 --> 01:39:45,324
That patient is low on glucose!

1005
01:39:47,115 --> 01:39:48,287
Let's play another round of cards?

1006
01:39:51,753 --> 01:39:54,427
This card looks promising

1007
01:39:57,191 --> 01:39:58,226
This is a hospital.

1008
01:40:01,563 --> 01:40:03,167
So you have cast the joker card itself?

1009
01:40:03,398 --> 01:40:04,399
Is number 3 the joker card?

1010
01:40:17,345 --> 01:40:18,790
He will definitely change

1011
01:40:19,781 --> 01:40:24,161
I've made this carrot upma specially for
you. Please eat.

1012
01:40:24,585 --> 01:40:25,689
Please give it to me.

1013
01:40:30,158 --> 01:40:31,535
Effect of the glucose!

1014
01:40:32,193 --> 01:40:34,332
I'll make biryani for you tomorrow.

1015
01:40:34,829 --> 01:40:36,396
<i>You know how to cook m“; am'?</i>

1016
01:40:36,397 --> 01:40:40,767
Of course! And also kebab, brain fry,
khaima balls...

1017
01:40:40,768 --> 01:40:45,105
Bhagya loves the khaima balls made by
me. Isn't it Bhagya?

1018
01:40:45,106 --> 01:40:45,584
Oh yes!

1019
01:40:46,240 --> 01:40:49,576
And from tomorrow onwards, she will bring
you varied dishes...

1020
01:40:49,577 --> 01:40:50,744
I don't think that's needed.

1021
01:40:50,745 --> 01:40:52,245
He will be discharged by the time she
brings biryani.

1022
01:40:52,246 --> 01:40:53,613
I'm sure!

1023
01:40:53,614 --> 01:40:54,381
Kama,

1024
01:40:54,382 --> 01:40:55,415
father has come!

1025
01:40:55,416 --> 01:40:56,449
Father has come!
Please convey my regards to him.

1026
01:40:56,450 --> 01:40:58,123
Dude not my father...yours!

1027
01:40:58,453 --> 01:40:59,353
Mine??

1028
01:40:59,354 --> 01:41:01,055
Yes and the principal has also come along
with him.

1029
01:41:01,056 --> 01:41:02,055
Huh, father has come!

1030
01:41:02,056 --> 01:41:03,290
Yes, his father has come.

1031
01:41:03,291 --> 01:41:04,691
I meant has my father also come?

1032
01:41:04,692 --> 01:41:06,126
I told you! Not your father...but his!

1033
01:41:06,127 --> 01:41:07,800
But you said the principal has also come?

1034
01:41:15,470 --> 01:41:17,108
Kama...

1035
01:41:17,672 --> 01:41:18,650
Kama...

1036
01:41:20,141 --> 01:41:21,176
your father is here...

1037
01:41:24,345 --> 01:41:25,085
Father...!

1038
01:41:26,514 --> 01:41:28,391
Can I ask his father for the balance
payment?

1039
01:41:29,150 --> 01:41:32,825
Sir, look at how they've beat up each other!

1040
01:41:33,454 --> 01:41:36,690
We don't need such students in our
college.

1041
01:41:36,691 --> 01:41:38,295
I've been observing him from the first year.

1042
01:41:38,860 --> 01:41:40,498
Should have given him a TC and sent him
away long time ago.

1043
01:41:40,695 --> 01:41:43,266
Please take him with you sir.
We don't need such students in our
college.

1044
01:41:43,531 --> 01:41:49,311
Even if I said no, you didn't heed to my
words
and left home to come here.

1045
01:41:50,171 --> 01:41:55,780
Since his college is at quite a distance from
the hostel,
I bought him a Bullet last year.

1046
01:41:55,910 --> 01:42:00,910
I thought let him study and not waste time
in commuting.

1047
01:42:01,516 --> 01:42:02,893
But what did he do?

1048
01:42:03,384 --> 01:42:05,786
Our family is renowned...

1049
01:42:05,787 --> 01:42:09,325
my father was a freedon fighter!

1050
01:42:11,158 --> 01:42:15,300
But this fellow is good for nothing! I'll take
him with me.

1051
01:42:15,730 --> 01:42:19,199
We have a petrol bunk, let him till fuel
there.

1052
01:42:19,200 --> 01:42:21,806
How will he fill fuel? He's hurt his hand!

1053
01:42:22,269 --> 01:42:26,340
I didn't mean it...please don't take such
hasty decisions.

1054
01:42:26,341 --> 01:42:28,508
Please advice him, he'll set right his ways.

1055
01:42:28,509 --> 01:42:30,420
I don't think one dose is enough!

1056
01:42:31,179 --> 01:42:32,545
You won't be able to understand this sir...

1057
01:42:32,546 --> 01:42:34,982
Please don't worry...he's not bad in
studies...always taking 60!

1058
01:42:34,983 --> 01:42:37,384
60 was in the old days, now it is 90

1059
01:42:37,385 --> 01:42:41,588
Upma is fabulous!

1060
01:42:41,589 --> 01:42:43,660
Upma! We had upma even at our home
today.

1061
01:42:49,797 --> 01:42:51,902
Same taste!

1062
01:42:52,934 --> 01:42:55,346
Hey, what are you doing here?

1063
01:42:56,738 --> 01:42:58,649
Father!

1064
01:43:00,908 --> 01:43:02,242
Your father?

1065
01:43:02,243 --> 01:43:03,745
Arial

1066
01:43:04,645 --> 01:43:06,279
There was a lot of leftover upma at home.

1067
01:43:06,280 --> 01:43:09,727
I didn't want to waste it, so came to
distribute it to the patients here.

1068
01:43:11,552 --> 01:43:12,319
Come Bhagya.

1069
01:43:12,320 --> 01:43:14,857
Let's go to the next ward. ...patients will be
waiting.

1070
01:43:15,490 --> 01:43:16,798
Please bless me uncle.

1071
01:43:18,560 --> 01:43:20,369
Such a cultured girl.

1072
01:43:20,528 --> 01:43:21,529
After all, she is my daughter!

1073
01:43:21,729 --> 01:43:25,336
I didn't want her to be a spoilt brat at home,
so sent her to live in the hostel.

1074
01:43:26,434 --> 01:43:29,779
I don't like what you're up to.

1075
01:43:36,878 --> 01:43:39,780
A decision has to be made today.

1076
01:43:39,781 --> 01:43:41,548
Will you mend your ways ,

1077
01:43:41,549 --> 01:43:44,223
or do you want to keep bashing up
everyone and become a rowdy?

1078
01:43:48,356 --> 01:43:49,232
I'll mend my ways.

1079
01:43:56,464 --> 01:43:57,772
Promise me.

1080
01:43:57,832 --> 01:43:59,778
As a student representative of this college,

1081
01:44:00,902 --> 01:44:04,247
I Kama, would like to...

1082
01:44:08,476 --> 01:44:09,343
Promise me...

1083
01:44:09,344 --> 01:44:13,613
That I will not take advantage of the
powers vested in me...

1084
01:44:13,614 --> 01:44:16,288
I will sincerely live up to the responsibilities
given to me...

1085
01:44:16,350 --> 01:44:20,053
That I will not take advantage of the
powers vested in me...

1086
01:44:20,054 --> 01:44:22,364
I will sincerely live up to the responsibilities
given to me...

1087
01:44:30,064 --> 01:44:31,975
I hereby solemnly pledge to do all of the
above...

1088
01:44:37,972 --> 01:44:40,107
The match resumes in the home ground of
the opponent

1089
01:44:40,108 --> 01:44:41,375
Its the final delivery

1090
01:44:41,376 --> 01:44:44,482
A mighty pull shot

1091
01:44:46,380 --> 01:44:48,848
That's a six, The score now stands at

1092
01:44:48,849 --> 01:44:49,953
100

1093
01:44:51,118 --> 01:44:53,787
Within half an hour of taking his oath,
Karna has thrashed a student from another
college.

1094
01:44:53,788 --> 01:44:55,889
Please rusticate him from our college

1095
01:44:55,890 --> 01:44:57,691
and take him down from the president's
post.

1096
01:44:57,692 --> 01:44:59,672
Such students spoil the reputation oi the
institution.

1097
01:45:00,394 --> 01:45:02,696
What proof do you have that we have
thrashed someone?

1098
01:45:02,697 --> 01:45:03,937
And what proof do you have to prove your
innocence?

1099
01:45:04,565 --> 01:45:05,565
We do.

1100
01:45:05,566 --> 01:45:08,570
It's waiting outside. One minute. I'll call
him.

1101
01:45:19,714 --> 01:45:21,022
This is the boy who Kama thrashed.

1102
01:45:21,582 --> 01:45:23,583
Really?Did we thrash you?

1103
01:45:23,584 --> 01:45:25,051
I don't know anything sir.

1104
01:45:25,052 --> 01:45:26,152
But Kama is a good man.

1105
01:45:26,153 --> 01:45:28,722
He's lying sir! Kama has threatened and
brought him here!

1106
01:45:28,723 --> 01:45:31,602
Don't be frightened of anybody.

1107
01:45:31,992 --> 01:45:34,494
Did Karna beat you up? Be bold and tell
me.

1108
01:45:34,495 --> 01:45:37,669
I know sir, but I also don't know
anything.All I know is that Karna is a good
man.

1109
01:45:38,599 --> 01:45:41,773
It that's the case, why are you wearing a
bandage?

1110
01:45:42,403 --> 01:45:45,638
Sir, I had come to your college for a fest.
But then a girl...

1111
01:45:45,639 --> 01:45:46,310
Father...!

1112
01:45:49,543 --> 01:45:51,544
Sir, I don't know anything about her.

1113
01:45:51,545 --> 01:45:52,683
Looks like she's also a good girl...

1114
01:45:55,849 --> 01:45:57,795
Karna, promise me that you haven't beat
him up...

1115
01:45:58,152 --> 01:45:59,586
Sir, what's the big deal...of course, I
promise!

1116
01:45:59,587 --> 01:46:00,588
Father, no!

1117
01:46:01,989 --> 01:46:03,824
Sir, don't trust these Mechanical boys!

1118
01:46:03,825 --> 01:46:06,601
Excuse me, we are tar better than you
Computer Science boys!

1119
01:46:06,894 --> 01:46:09,568
What better? After engineering, you guys
don't even get a decent job!

1120
01:46:09,897 --> 01:46:12,571
Ok boys, please let's not tight about which
branch is better.

1121
01:46:12,834 --> 01:46:14,814
Sir, this is not a tight. It's a healthy
argument.

1122
01:46:15,035 --> 01:46:17,704
We Mechanical boys get jobs in the IT
sector Mr Lokesh Kumar.

1123
01:46:17,705 --> 01:46:19,685
Now let's see if you can do the same!

1124
01:46:19,840 --> 01:46:22,081
Who even wants your job? All you do is
saw with a haxo blade!

1125
01:46:22,610 --> 01:46:23,810
So you'd rather sell tickets in black then?

1126
01:46:23,811 --> 01:46:25,552
Look, that's a personal matter!

1127
01:46:25,746 --> 01:46:26,780
What the hell is going on here?

1128
01:46:26,781 --> 01:46:28,852
I don't know sir. They're all good boys.

1129
01:46:28,950 --> 01:46:30,054
I wasn't talking to you.

1130
01:46:30,885 --> 01:46:32,762
Boys, please don't fight...

1131
01:46:33,053 --> 01:46:34,794
It's not a tight sir, it's a healthy argument.

1132
01:46:35,056 --> 01:46:37,559
Why should we fight with Mechanical boys.
We have our standards.

1133
01:46:37,758 --> 01:46:39,533
What is the big deal about typing away on
a keyboard?

1134
01:46:40,928 --> 01:46:42,874
Sir, didn't we tell you that this is not a fight?

1135
01:46:47,968 --> 01:46:50,536
It we don't get a job, we'll at least set up a
garage.

1136
01:46:50,537 --> 01:46:55,384
Unlike you guys, we won't put up a board
saying
“Get your PAN cards done here” and run a
cyber centre!

1137
01:46:55,443 --> 01:46:58,083
Even if we run a cyber centre, we will be
relaxing in an A/C room

1138
01:46:58,779 --> 01:47:01,781
With a couple of spanners , you can't turn
your future around.

1139
01:47:01,782 --> 01:47:04,183
You might be able to tighten a few loose
screws in your head.

1140
01:47:04,184 --> 01:47:06,460
Even if we hold spanners, we'll do a good
job with it.

1141
01:47:06,520 --> 01:47:08,855
Unlike you IT boys who will have to work
long hours in an MNC,

1142
01:47:08,856 --> 01:47:12,725
curse your managers and drown your
sorrows over a drink at a pub.

1143
01:47:12,726 --> 01:47:14,494
We belong to the Royal Mechanical club!

1144
01:47:14,495 --> 01:47:15,162
Are you a Mechanical student

1145
01:47:15,163 --> 01:47:16,471
No, Electrical.

1146
01:47:16,697 --> 01:47:17,573
Then why are you supporting them?

1147
01:47:17,732 --> 01:47:19,699
Because we supply electricity to their
machines.

1148
01:47:19,700 --> 01:47:22,237
We share a connection, so you mind your
own business.

1149
01:47:22,569 --> 01:47:24,071
Guys, please take her from here

1150
01:47:24,805 --> 01:47:25,249
Come

1151
01:47:26,807 --> 01:47:27,615
Ok, later later...

1152
01:47:28,809 --> 01:47:29,947
Come come...where's Bhagya?

1153
01:47:30,144 --> 01:47:34,681
Hello...you better know your
standards...you can never raise it

1154
01:47:34,682 --> 01:47:36,025
Of course we can! We'll even climb a
building if we have to!

1155
01:47:36,183 --> 01:47:37,526
We will construct that building...

1156
01:47:39,086 --> 01:47:41,855
ah...l'm from Civil Engineering...

1157
01:47:41,856 --> 01:47:43,460
thought I'll contribute something to the
argument

1158
01:47:43,791 --> 01:47:45,099
Even a mason can do that job!

1159
01:47:46,727 --> 01:47:47,637
Please come...

1160
01:47:49,697 --> 01:47:50,573
Hasn't Bhagya come today?

1161
01:47:54,635 --> 01:47:55,545
Go bring her...

1162
01:47:57,204 --> 01:47:57,737
it's been ages since I saw her

1163
01:47:57,738 --> 01:47:58,443
it's been ages since I saw her

1164
01:48:10,951 --> 01:48:15,297
You are the reason behind my beautiful
dreams

1165
01:48:16,323 --> 01:48:20,829
You have made your way into my heart

1166
01:48:21,895 --> 01:48:26,605
Without my knowing, it seems like I'm
ready to become one with you

1167
01:48:27,101 --> 01:48:31,675
There I go, as my shyness takes over and I
stand rooted to the spot

1168
01:48:35,877 --> 01:48:37,948
Kama is not nice...he's very short
tempered

1169
01:48:38,979 --> 01:48:41,681
The sun hides behind the clouds

1170
01:48:41,682 --> 01:48:44,050
And when he comes out, he's capable of
melting me

1171
01:48:44,051 --> 01:48:47,821
Isn't he the one who paints the rainbow?

1172
01:48:47,822 --> 01:48:49,589
The whole college fears him...

1173
01:48:49,590 --> 01:48:52,258
Even if the moon seems luminous

1174
01:48:52,259 --> 01:48:54,628
People choose to look at the dark spots
within

1175
01:48:54,629 --> 01:48:58,133
So how will they appreciate the divine
moonlight?

1176
01:48:59,633 --> 01:49:04,582
The words that I wish to say to you, remain
within me yet...

1177
01:49:04,905 --> 01:49:09,854
Just like the flower that awaits the arrival of
the sun to bloom

1178
01:49:11,278 --> 01:49:13,519
I want you close to me

1179
01:49:13,948 --> 01:49:16,019
Without worrying about tomorrow

1180
01:49:16,650 --> 01:49:18,630
I want you close to me

1181
01:49:19,086 --> 01:49:21,589
For there are so many things to be said...

1182
01:49:23,157 --> 01:49:27,936
I will flow into your heart like the cascading
stream

1183
01:49:28,629 --> 01:49:34,807
It'd be befitting if you engulf me in your
ocean of love

1184
01:49:36,770 --> 01:49:37,804
Follow the queue.

1185
01:49:37,805 --> 01:49:39,113
What are you doing here? Get lost

1186
01:49:40,808 --> 01:49:44,221
Can you please make this remote gas
leakage detector project for me?

1187
01:49:50,350 --> 01:49:51,260
Ok sir.

1188
01:49:52,019 --> 01:49:54,021
50% advance, Keep it there.

1189
01:49:56,723 --> 01:49:58,258
What are you doing here?

1190
01:49:58,259 --> 01:50:00,000
I'm looking.

1191
01:50:03,831 --> 01:50:06,675
I'm looking at the menu.

1192
01:50:08,169 --> 01:50:09,773
You are looking at it the wrong way. Turn it
around.

1193
01:50:18,446 --> 01:50:19,891
We too would have stood in the queue

1194
01:50:20,714 --> 01:50:22,849
I'm sure! But you guys are VIPs...

1195
01:50:22,850 --> 01:50:24,989
So I asked my boy to make you'll sit here

1196
01:50:25,152 --> 01:50:26,062
What's the special treatment for VIPs?

1197
01:50:26,387 --> 01:50:30,392
Look there. The guys in the queue have to
pay a 50% advance.

1198
01:50:30,825 --> 01:50:31,735
And VIPs?

1199
01:50:31,959 --> 01:50:33,370
VIPs have to pay 100% advance.

1200
01:50:33,828 --> 01:50:35,307
Because they are tough to catch hold of.

1201
01:50:36,396 --> 01:50:37,306
Let this be ready tomorrow

1202
01:50:39,833 --> 01:50:40,743
There's 40 thousand in this.

1203
01:50:41,435 --> 01:50:45,383
Don't worry at all. For this amount, you'll
get a fabulous project.

1204
01:50:47,741 --> 01:50:48,651
Ok, let's go

1205
01:51:11,365 --> 01:51:16,365
O dear heart of mine...

1206
01:51:16,437 --> 01:51:21,437
You probably want to add more color to
my life...

1207
01:51:22,109 --> 01:51:27,109
Shy as a peacock, I'm now going crazy
with your love

1208
01:51:27,515 --> 01:51:32,185
I'm now forgetting my own self...

1209
01:51:32,186 --> 01:51:37,186
I now smile to myself without a care in the
world...

1210
01:51:37,291 --> 01:51:45,506
There I go, as my shyness takes over and I
stand rooted to the spot

1211
01:51:52,439 --> 01:51:55,041
The sun hides behind the clouds

1212
01:51:55,042 --> 01:51:57,810
And when he comes out, he's capable of
melting me

1213
01:51:57,811 --> 01:52:02,282
Isn't he the one who paints the rainbow?

1214
01:52:03,250 --> 01:52:08,250
Even if the moon seems luminous, people
choose to look at the dark spots within

1215
01:52:08,755 --> 01:52:13,226
So how will they appreciate the divine
moonlight?

1216
01:52:13,227 --> 01:52:18,227
Just like the flower that awaits the arrival of
the sun to bloom

1217
01:52:24,238 --> 01:52:27,140
I want you close to me

1218
01:52:27,141 --> 01:52:29,909
Without worrying about tomorrow

1219
01:52:29,910 --> 01:52:32,946
I want you close to me

1220
01:52:32,947 --> 01:52:35,415
For there are so many things to be said...

1221
01:52:35,416 --> 01:52:40,416
I want you close to me,
without worrying about tomorrow

1222
01:52:40,854 --> 01:52:45,854
I want you close to me, for there are so
many things to be said...

1223
01:52:46,994 --> 01:52:51,994
I will flow into your heart like the cascading
stream

1224
01:52:52,433 --> 01:53:00,579
It'd be befitting if you engulf me in your
ocean of love

1225
01:53:04,979 --> 01:53:07,391
You will learn a lesson when you flunk your
internals!

1226
01:53:15,456 --> 01:53:16,992
Sorry sir, my car broke down.

1227
01:53:17,958 --> 01:53:19,335
Your car broke down?

1228
01:53:26,200 --> 01:53:28,100
My car wasn't moving.

1229
01:53:28,101 --> 01:53:29,842
It wasn't moving?

1230
01:53:41,115 --> 01:53:41,559
No...no!

1231
01:53:42,983 --> 01:53:45,862
No sir..the car would start...but it wouldn't
move

1232
01:54:00,834 --> 01:54:04,077
Sir, I was able to switch gears, but the car
wouldn't move.

1233
01:54:13,247 --> 01:54:15,090
Nothing of that sort...the hand break was
on...

1234
01:54:17,618 --> 01:54:20,030
once I released it, the car moved

1235
01:54:33,967 --> 01:54:35,378
Why are you leaving those blank spaces?

1236
01:54:36,303 --> 01:54:39,079
Only if I leave the paper blank, will I be
able to fill it in the night!

1237
01:54:45,078 --> 01:54:46,887
Please take out Mahesh's blue book first.

1238
01:54:47,581 --> 01:54:48,247
L 9on1!

1239
01:54:48,248 --> 01:54:49,056
I'm glad I'll pass...

1240
01:54:49,516 --> 01:54:52,185
3 eggs are out

1241
01:54:52,186 --> 01:54:53,119
Let it all come out...

1242
01:54:53,120 --> 01:54:54,565
4 eggs are out

1243
01:54:56,423 --> 01:54:57,990
Where the hell are these boys?

1244
01:54:57,991 --> 01:55:00,193
They went to go get the answer sheets and
still no sign of them

1245
01:55:00,194 --> 01:55:01,502
Don't worry, they'll come.

1246
01:55:02,496 --> 01:55:04,533
Kama, where are you off to?

1247
01:55:07,101 --> 01:55:09,411
I'll go to Loki's room for 5 minutes

1248
01:55:09,703 --> 01:55:13,583
Dude, sit here. Don't go.

1249
01:55:16,710 --> 01:55:18,553
20 eggs are out

1250
01:55:19,713 --> 01:55:21,317
Enough, enough...

1251
01:55:21,615 --> 01:55:22,491
Sir, is it enough!!

1252
01:55:24,384 --> 01:55:25,454
Dude,

1253
01:55:25,986 --> 01:55:28,523
not to you. I said enough to the drink he
was pouring

1254
01:55:29,523 --> 01:55:31,657
<i>22</i> eggs are out

1255
01:55:31,658 --> 01:55:33,331
Why the hell are you standing idle?

1256
01:55:34,395 --> 01:55:37,308
1 egg is out, 2 eggs are out, 3 eggs are
out, 4 are out, 5...

1257
01:55:39,766 --> 01:55:43,646
Dude, you're a rooster! Since when did
roosters start laying eggs?

1258
01:55:45,272 --> 01:55:46,580
You do one thing.

1259
01:55:47,541 --> 01:55:48,508
You make omelettes.

1260
01:55:48,509 --> 01:55:49,283
Ok sir.

1261
01:55:49,743 --> 01:55:52,246
But how will a rooster make omelettes

1262
01:55:59,052 --> 01:56:02,989
Whoever makes an omelette, this is the
way you should do it.

1263
01:56:02,990 --> 01:56:04,230
Ok sir!

1264
01:56:09,129 --> 01:56:14,129
Poor fellow, he's working so hard to make
an omelelte. Why are you idle?

1265
01:56:14,368 --> 01:56:15,468
Chop onions.

1266
01:56:15,469 --> 01:56:16,447
Ok sir

1267
01:56:19,573 --> 01:56:21,416
Ok,Karna is off again

1268
01:56:22,142 --> 01:56:24,010
Karna, where are you going?

1269
01:56:24,011 --> 01:56:26,812
Dude, I'll go to Loki's room for a bit

1270
01:56:26,813 --> 01:56:27,791
Dude, why?

1271
01:56:30,150 --> 01:56:34,064
Dude...come..please sit...don't

1272
01:56:35,722 --> 01:56:38,430
Sir, do you want a single or double
omelette?

1273
01:56:47,133 --> 01:56:48,100
What?

1274
01:56:48,101 --> 01:56:50,081
Not 36...34 eggs

1275
01:56:51,305 --> 01:56:53,506
Sir, it is 36 eggs...l have the right count

1276
01:56:53,507 --> 01:56:55,509
Dude, I took <i>2</i> out of them to make
omelettes

1277
01:56:57,511 --> 01:57:00,346
Dude, what are you making?

1278
01:57:00,347 --> 01:57:01,519
Sir, I'm making omelettes

1279
01:57:02,115 --> 01:57:03,788
But the sizzling sound is missing

1280
01:57:11,859 --> 01:57:14,669
Sir, I'm chopping onions

1281
01:57:15,395 --> 01:57:17,068
But your eyes aren't watering at all!

1282
01:57:17,664 --> 01:57:20,076
Sir it's hot, please be carefull.

1283
01:57:25,205 --> 01:57:26,240
What happend?

1284
01:57:26,640 --> 01:57:28,240
Dude, you stepped on the eggs!

1285
01:57:28,241 --> 01:57:29,083
E9Qs??

1286
01:57:30,644 --> 01:57:35,684
Oh God, how do we make omelettes now?

1287
01:57:40,287 --> 01:57:45,287
1 egg came out, 2 eggs came out, 3 eggs
are out, 4...

1288
01:57:49,196 --> 01:57:51,198
I'm sure I'll get 25 marks!

1289
01:57:54,634 --> 01:57:57,615
Bloody hell, can't even walk straight after
some pegs...

1290
01:58:05,479 --> 01:58:07,580
Dude...look there!

1291
01:58:07,581 --> 01:58:10,082
(Peon is humming a popular Kannada
song)

1292
01:58:10,083 --> 01:58:13,690
I think the peon has seen us coming out of
the staff room

1293
01:58:15,288 --> 01:58:17,427
I'm sure he hasn't seen us...it's dark

1294
01:58:18,124 --> 01:58:20,426
Of course he has!

1295
01:58:20,427 --> 01:58:23,135
Had he seen us, he'd have definitely said
Hi!

1296
01:58:24,364 --> 01:58:26,366
I'm sure he's seen us

1297
01:58:26,833 --> 01:58:29,905
Why worry about it?

1298
01:58:30,871 --> 01:58:32,612
Let's do one thing.

1299
01:58:33,340 --> 01:58:37,910
Let's ask the peon himself if he has seen
us coming out of the staff room.

1300
01:58:37,911 --> 01:58:39,822
Yes, yes.

1301
01:58:42,215 --> 01:58:44,583
I think it's a waste of time...

1302
01:58:44,584 --> 01:58:45,654
wait...

1303
01:58:46,520 --> 01:58:48,761
if he had seen us, he'd have definitely said
Hi!

1304
01:58:49,456 --> 01:58:50,628
Come lets go

1305
01:58:57,931 --> 01:59:04,314
The peon and I joined the college together
eight years ago...

1306
01:59:05,538 --> 01:59:08,280
we've been friends for eight years...

1307
01:59:09,543 --> 01:59:13,345
had he seen us, he'd have definitely said
Hi

1308
01:59:13,346 --> 01:59:15,883
Dude, he'd headed to the principal's
house!

1309
01:59:16,850 --> 01:59:21,587
Ok, we are in for trouble..he's seen us for
sure

1310
01:59:21,588 --> 01:59:23,689
Confirmed?

1311
01:59:23,690 --> 01:59:24,957
Yes!

1312
01:59:24,958 --> 01:59:27,393
I'm sure he'd have said Hi if he had...

1313
01:59:27,394 --> 01:59:30,307
Dude, where has he disappeared?

1314
01:59:30,797 --> 01:59:32,504
I can't see him

1315
01:59:33,567 --> 01:59:39,449
Girl, wait here until I signal you to come. I'll
go check on the scene

1316
01:59:39,739 --> 01:59:40,843
okay

1317
01:59:54,321 --> 02:00:01,762
(Singing a romantic number calls out to his
lover...)

1318
02:00:03,363 --> 02:00:06,833
(She responds with another romantic line)

1319
02:00:09,870 --> 02:00:12,680
Stay quiet! Tnis is the principal's house.

1320
02:00:13,440 --> 02:00:15,317
Let's creep in quietly and kidnap him.

1321
02:00:23,350 --> 02:00:25,455
Dude, is this your signal?

1322
02:00:25,986 --> 02:00:28,728
Not this dude! I'll tell you.

1323
02:00:30,424 --> 02:00:32,267
Dude, get down...l'll tell him.

1324
02:00:35,328 --> 02:00:39,435
Keep your right leg there. Yeah, now left...

1325
02:00:46,006 --> 02:00:48,612
Dude, how did you get in here?

1326
02:00:56,283 --> 02:00:57,318
You get down dude

1327
02:00:58,785 --> 02:01:00,552
Sir, dont trust what the peon says...

1328
02:01:00,553 --> 02:01:01,854
Don't scream boys!

1329
02:01:01,855 --> 02:01:03,459
I didn't say a word...

1330
02:01:04,524 --> 02:01:05,758
What happened darling?

1331
02:01:05,759 --> 02:01:07,033
I heard some noise outside

1332
02:01:07,961 --> 02:01:10,373
Wait, let me go check

1333
02:01:15,569 --> 02:01:16,741
Press the door bell.

1334
02:01:17,337 --> 02:01:20,806
As soon as he comes, let's beat him up

1335
02:01:20,807 --> 02:01:23,743
This is not college for the peon to arrive as
soon as you ring the bell.

1336
02:01:23,744 --> 02:01:25,382
This is the principal's house!

1337
02:01:59,946 --> 02:02:02,682
You beat him up even before I could say
Hi!

1338
02:02:02,683 --> 02:02:05,951
Dude, is this your signal??

1339
02:02:05,952 --> 02:02:08,660
Not this! I told you I'll let everyone know
when I do!

1340
02:02:09,823 --> 02:02:11,691
Who's that?

1341
02:02:11,692 --> 02:02:14,571
It's me the cat!

1342
02:02:21,501 --> 02:02:23,536
Dude, here's my signal!

1343
02:02:23,537 --> 02:02:25,949
Is that so? Ok

1344
02:02:34,147 --> 02:02:37,993
Slowly be carefull

1345
02:02:46,092 --> 02:02:47,693
Dude, look here!

1346
02:02:47,694 --> 02:02:48,961
Dude, come here

1347
02:02:48,962 --> 02:02:50,796
Dude, listen to me!

1348
02:02:50,797 --> 02:02:52,674
Come fast!

1349
02:02:54,033 --> 02:02:55,701
The peon...

1350
02:02:55,702 --> 02:02:59,149
Don't even mention his name...he is a
traitor!

1351
02:03:15,455 --> 02:03:17,128
We should never drink again guys...

1352
02:03:42,415 --> 02:03:43,917
Boys, would you like to drink some tender
coconut?

1353
02:03:45,619 --> 02:03:46,689
Ok, chuck it.

1354
02:03:49,589 --> 02:03:50,590
Dude,

1355
02:03:51,724 --> 02:03:52,930
this is bound to become a huge issue.

1356
02:03:54,694 --> 02:03:56,962
We've kidnapped the college peon!

1357
02:03:56,963 --> 02:03:58,564
What the hell do we do?

1358
02:03:58,565 --> 02:03:59,805
Open the boot!

1359
02:04:00,233 --> 02:04:01,906
What if he suffocates in there and dies?

1360
02:04:02,569 --> 02:04:06,142
I won't open it. I'm not involved in this
issue. I only drove the car.

1361
02:04:12,479 --> 02:04:16,982
What the hell have we done? This is not a
small matter.

1362
02:04:16,983 --> 02:04:19,759
We've kidnapped our college peon guys!

1363
02:04:48,114 --> 02:04:50,594
This is what I've been trying to tell you'll
since last night...

1364
02:04:52,118 --> 02:04:57,693
We've kidnapped our college
principal, not our peon Narayana!

1365
02:05:29,155 --> 02:05:30,293
Where's the principal?

1366
02:05:31,157 --> 02:05:32,758
I clearly saw that it was him last night...

1367
02:05:32,759 --> 02:05:35,069
when we closed the boot, it was the
principal who was inside

1368
02:05:39,065 --> 02:05:42,568
Guess he must have gone for his morning
walk on waking up

1369
02:05:42,569 --> 02:05:44,136
Ravi please tell us what really happened!

1370
02:05:44,137 --> 02:05:47,516
I swear to god it was the principal..l
remember clearly

1371
02:05:51,111 --> 02:05:55,924
Ok, we were all drunk last night. Let's sit
down and think calmly

1372
02:05:57,150 --> 02:06:00,962
We began drinking at 7o clock last night

1373
02:06:10,730 --> 02:06:14,268
At 80 clock, we went to the staff room to
keep our answer sheets back

1374
02:06:15,869 --> 02:06:21,148
Then we got a doubt that the peon had
caught us in the act

1375
02:06:24,110 --> 02:06:27,614
Then we followed him to the principal's
house

1376
02:06:31,217 --> 02:06:33,891
Mistaking him to the be the peon, we beat
up our principal

1377
02:06:34,354 --> 02:06:35,697
With this?

1378
02:07:04,283 --> 02:07:08,620
Guys, let's go back to the principal's house,
open the boot of his car and escape
silently.

1379
02:07:08,621 --> 02:07:10,726
Some passer by will help him.

1380
02:07:13,159 --> 02:07:15,196
Dude, there's a CCTV in his house!

1381
02:07:16,429 --> 02:07:18,170
I'm sure we'll be caught!

1382
02:07:18,998 --> 02:07:21,171
We've kidnapped the college principal
itself,

1383
02:07:22,769 --> 02:07:25,147
you think getting hold oi the CCTV footage
is a big deal?

1384
02:07:26,239 --> 02:07:28,006
God knows where he's gone?

1385
02:07:28,007 --> 02:07:32,319
He's never gone anywhere without
informing me.

1386
02:07:33,680 --> 02:07:36,815
Where do I search for him?

1387
02:07:36,816 --> 02:07:39,017
I've never felt this helpless...

1388
02:07:39,018 --> 02:07:42,363
Oh god, where has he gone?

1389
02:07:45,391 --> 02:07:47,259
The camera is here, where's the footage?

1390
02:07:47,260 --> 02:07:48,927
Even the CCTV isn't working!

1391
02:07:48,928 --> 02:07:49,328
Mom...

1392
02:07:49,329 --> 02:07:52,397
I've told him so many times to get it
repaired.

1393
02:07:52,398 --> 02:07:54,674
But he never listens to me

1394
02:07:54,734 --> 02:07:58,069
Kama! My dad has been missing since
morning!

1395
02:07:58,070 --> 02:08:01,347
Oh really?? Ok!

1396
02:08:07,013 --> 02:08:07,991
Where are you guys going?

1397
02:08:16,489 --> 02:08:18,366
We searched everywhere...he's not to be
found

1398
02:08:20,760 --> 02:08:22,831
Oh god, where has he gone??

1399
02:08:23,796 --> 02:08:25,742
He's even left his phone at home.

1400
02:08:26,199 --> 02:08:28,475
Mom, please stop crying. He'll come back.

1401
02:08:28,968 --> 02:08:30,502
Madam, have you searched for him on the
terrace?

1402
02:08:30,503 --> 02:08:31,970
We've already looked there.

1403
02:08:31,971 --> 02:08:33,505
Except for papads that are drying there,
there's nothing else.

1404
02:08:33,506 --> 02:08:36,075
What if he's gone out for a walk?

1405
02:08:36,076 --> 02:08:38,210
He's not in the park. I've already searched
there.

1406
02:08:38,211 --> 02:08:40,245
Did you check with relatives?

1407
02:08:40,246 --> 02:08:42,920
All of them are useless..not one is
answering their phone.

1408
02:08:45,852 --> 02:08:46,518
What ii he's visiting some friends?

1409
02:08:46,519 --> 02:08:47,725
We've asked...he isn't there

1410
02:08:56,930 --> 02:08:59,376
Dude, you think he's in the boot of the car?

1411
02:09:00,800 --> 02:09:01,835
In the boot?

1412
02:09:02,568 --> 02:09:03,945
Did you search the boot of his car?

1413
02:09:11,478 --> 02:09:14,152
Oh god, what are you doing here? Are you
okay?

1414
02:09:14,881 --> 02:09:17,148
Sir, wake up!

1415
02:09:17,149 --> 02:09:19,026
Please be c areful

1416
02:09:19,552 --> 02:09:21,031
How did you come here?

1417
02:09:22,989 --> 02:09:26,801
Some people had sneaked into the house
last night.

1418
02:09:27,426 --> 02:09:29,030
When I heard the commotion, I came out to
check.

1419
02:09:30,563 --> 02:09:34,067
That's when they hit my head and put me
here in the boot.

1420
02:09:34,901 --> 02:09:37,803
Rascals, I won't spare them,

1421
02:09:37,804 --> 02:09:40,080
I'll ensure they face the music.

1422
02:09:42,041 --> 02:09:43,349
Loki.

1423
02:09:44,310 --> 02:09:46,847
How did you know that the principal is in
the boot of the car?

1424
02:10:12,472 --> 02:10:13,974
So this is the mega project you promised
us?

1425
02:10:16,108 --> 02:10:16,984
What is it?

1426
02:10:19,312 --> 02:10:21,880
So we are supposed to ride this and
become milk vendors?

1427
02:10:21,881 --> 02:10:23,415
This is no ordinary vehicle...

1428
02:10:23,416 --> 02:10:24,649
it is multi purpose!

1429
02:10:24,650 --> 02:10:25,584
In what way?

1430
02:10:25,585 --> 02:10:29,421
It can ride on both land and water.

1431
02:10:29,422 --> 02:10:33,234
Look here, in case of a flood,

1432
02:10:34,227 --> 02:10:38,163
you can weld this frame and fit it here

1433
02:10:38,164 --> 02:10:43,034
And this tube can be coupled to that hook
there and tilled with air...

1434
02:10:43,035 --> 02:10:45,237
thisn will help you stay afloat

1435
02:10:45,238 --> 02:10:47,072
So it cost you 40 thousand for this
masterpiece??

1436
02:10:47,073 --> 02:10:49,641
No way! This cost only 5 thousand.

1437
02:10:49,642 --> 02:10:50,382
And the balance amount?

1438
02:10:50,543 --> 02:10:54,546
I used the remaining 35 thousand to settle
an old balance.

1439
02:10:54,547 --> 02:10:59,087
Ghouse, no matter how much I repair it, it
is networking.

1440
02:11:01,053 --> 02:11:02,088
Bro, Ravi...hi!

1441
02:11:03,022 --> 02:11:04,228
What are you doing here?

1442
02:11:05,458 --> 02:11:06,424
I was just hanging around...

1443
02:11:06,425 --> 02:11:08,927
No she wasn't just hanging around here.

1444
02:11:08,928 --> 02:11:12,164
It was her idea to clear the balance of 35
thousand.

1445
02:11:12,165 --> 02:11:15,146
Look, she even gave me a smiley.

1446
02:11:15,901 --> 02:11:18,337
Here, eat some sweets.

1447
02:11:18,338 --> 02:11:21,148
Here...take.

1448
02:11:21,440 --> 02:11:24,509
I'm so happy that, my balance amount got
cleared!

1449
02:11:24,510 --> 02:11:29,080
Oh god, I have to go. ll I get late, they
won't let me into the hostel.

1450
02:11:29,081 --> 02:11:33,291
Karna, can you please drop me to the
hostel?

1451
02:11:33,352 --> 02:11:35,992
Go Karna, drop her. Poor girl!

1452
02:11:38,924 --> 02:11:41,268
Ok, come on guys, let's drop her on the
way.

1453
02:11:42,428 --> 02:11:46,205
Why trouble the poor boys? They're yet to
finish eating sweets.

1454
02:11:49,201 --> 02:11:53,411
Kama, that's right. We want to eat some
more. You go drop her.

1455
02:11:59,045 --> 02:12:00,251
Sit down boys

1456
02:12:03,116 --> 02:12:04,561
Take a right here

1457
02:12:06,085 --> 02:12:07,564
The college is on the left isn't it?

1458
02:12:08,387 --> 02:12:11,456
It's already 10 o lock. No way they will let
me in to the hostel at this hour!

1459
02:12:11,457 --> 02:12:13,091
Come, I'll drop you home.

1460
02:12:13,092 --> 02:12:15,572
If my dad gets to know I haven't gone back
to the hostel, he'll kill me!

1461
02:12:16,595 --> 02:12:17,630
<i>OK, what do you want to do'?</i>

1462
02:12:19,265 --> 02:12:20,369
Let's go on a long drive?

1463
02:12:21,134 --> 02:12:22,272
Are you crazy?

1464
02:12:42,988 --> 02:12:44,126
I've been observing for the past two hours!

1465
02:12:44,557 --> 02:12:46,503
Me, too!

1466
02:12:47,627 --> 02:12:48,993
Where are we going now?

1467
02:12:48,994 --> 02:12:50,371
Stop the car!

1468
02:12:55,968 --> 02:12:56,701
Where are you going Arya?

1469
02:12:56,702 --> 02:12:58,113
To enquire about an address

1470
02:13:01,340 --> 02:13:02,512
Wait Kama!

1471
02:13:03,075 --> 02:13:05,112
Sir...

1472
02:13:07,079 --> 02:13:08,183
Were you asleep?

1473
02:13:09,048 --> 02:13:10,584
Don't worry, I'm not a cop.

1474
02:13:11,451 --> 02:13:13,397
How do I get to Kanyakumari from here?

1475
02:13:14,119 --> 02:13:14,688
Where to?

1476
02:13:24,563 --> 02:13:26,736
We have a lifetime to get serious!

1477
02:13:30,203 --> 02:13:31,079
Come

1478
02:13:36,175 --> 02:13:39,144
Arya! Where are you going?

1479
02:13:39,145 --> 02:13:41,216
You'll know once we get to the other side.
Come.

1480
02:13:44,717 --> 02:13:46,451
Hey, what are you doing?

1481
02:13:46,452 --> 02:13:47,522
Keep quiet and follow me.

1482
02:13:59,498 --> 02:14:01,532
Arya, the rope hasn't been untied yet!

1483
02:14:01,533 --> 02:14:03,672
Then how will we find our way back if we
untie it?

1484
02:14:42,675 --> 02:14:44,142
We could've eaten this in the car itself!

1485
02:14:44,143 --> 02:14:45,850
And you could've said the same thing in
the car, too.

1486
02:14:48,581 --> 02:14:51,357
Do you know why people go for candlelight
dinners?

1487
02:14:52,351 --> 02:14:53,351
When there's a power cut?

1488
02:14:53,352 --> 02:14:54,419
No.

1489
02:14:54,420 --> 02:14:59,529
Because the eyes become all the more
attractive in the dark...

1490
02:15:05,431 --> 02:15:07,468
Who's that over there?

1491
02:15:09,201 --> 02:15:11,503
Ramanna, it's me Arya.

1492
02:15:11,504 --> 02:15:12,570
VVhO Arya?

1493
02:15:12,571 --> 02:15:15,245
The same one who came here last week.

1494
02:15:15,574 --> 02:15:17,645
You even enquired about my health.

1495
02:15:17,910 --> 02:15:21,221
I asked you what the hell are you doing
here at this time?

1496
02:15:22,348 --> 02:15:25,650
Are you crazy? What do you want?

1497
02:15:25,651 --> 02:15:28,553
I wanted to know the route to Kanyakumari

1498
02:15:28,554 --> 02:15:29,396
What??

1499
02:15:30,757 --> 02:15:34,492
Kanyakumari? Come here, I'll show you!

1500
02:15:34,493 --> 02:15:35,563
I won't come!

1501
02:15:35,661 --> 02:15:37,362
Kama row faster!

1502
02:15:37,363 --> 02:15:39,707
You wont come? I'll teach you a lesson!

1503
02:15:42,935 --> 02:15:45,313
Arya, the boat is goin backwords!

1504
02:15:47,640 --> 02:15:48,710
Do you know how to swim?

1505
02:15:51,477 --> 02:15:52,319
Yes. I do

1506
02:16:01,954 --> 02:16:04,523
I'm very hungry. What about you?

1507
02:16:04,524 --> 02:16:07,505
No. I ate some fish on my way.

1508
02:16:09,762 --> 02:16:12,208
I am hungry actually.

1509
02:16:12,664 --> 02:16:13,836
But I don't have any money

1510
02:16:19,438 --> 02:16:22,248
But you're not a cop..so then?

1511
02:16:22,775 --> 02:16:24,843
You got to know that?

1512
02:16:24,844 --> 02:16:26,978
Wait...don't run away

1513
02:16:26,979 --> 02:16:30,415
<i>Kama, move“!</i>

1514
02:16:30,416 --> 02:16:36,298
Give back my money! Wait...don't go
away...

1515
02:16:43,262 --> 02:16:45,296
I've been observing for the past year...

1516
02:16:45,297 --> 02:16:47,470
I've never seen you laugh so whole
heanedly

1517
02:16:49,868 --> 02:16:53,315
By the way, why is your friend Ravi after
my friend Bhagya?

1518
02:16:54,840 --> 02:16:56,708
For the same reason that you're after me...

1519
02:16:56,709 --> 02:17:00,350
Aha! So you observe these subtle details!

1520
02:17:02,582 --> 02:17:03,390
Whom is this parcel for?

1521
02:17:16,495 --> 02:17:21,376
Uncle, I promise to return your 50 bucks!

1522
02:17:28,073 --> 02:17:29,848
Wait, stop the car!

1523
02:17:30,909 --> 02:17:31,843
Why? What happened?

1524
02:17:31,844 --> 02:17:33,289
Please go and press the door bell of that
house

1525
02:17:37,016 --> 02:17:38,996
Am I crazy to go and press the door bell of
a stranger's house?

1526
02:17:39,852 --> 02:17:42,924
Din't I buy you breakfast? Now go get us
some coffee

1527
02:18:26,732 --> 02:18:27,642
Come in.

1528
02:18:30,369 --> 02:18:32,304
Uncle...myfriend...

1529
02:18:32,305 --> 02:18:35,878
Arya had informed that you'd be coming.
Come in

1530
02:18:46,518 --> 02:18:48,520
Would you like to have some coffee or tea?

1531
02:18:48,521 --> 02:18:50,762
That's ok aunty. I've had my breakfast.

1532
02:18:58,130 --> 02:18:59,837
You must be in the final year now, isn't it?

1533
02:19:00,466 --> 02:19:01,103
Yes uncle

1534
02:19:02,001 --> 02:19:07,314
The Kama I had in mind to the one I'm
seeing right now are poles apart.

1535
02:19:08,040 --> 02:19:09,917
Saanvi has written a lot about you.

1536
02:20:04,162 --> 02:20:07,166
That photograph was clicked when Saanvi
was 4 years old.

1537
02:20:09,868 --> 02:20:16,080
I've been more of a control freak with her
than a loving father.

1538
02:20:17,643 --> 02:20:19,677
When she passed away,

1539
02:20:19,678 --> 02:20:22,546
more than the sadness of losing a
daughter,

1540
02:20:22,547 --> 02:20:28,190
it was the humiliation oi the manner in
which she died that weighed on my mind.

1541
02:20:28,987 --> 02:20:31,729
I tried shutting out all her memories.

1542
02:20:35,227 --> 02:20:37,639
We even vacated the house in which she
was born and raised.

1543
02:20:38,763 --> 02:20:44,179
Even though I tried every method to satisfy
my ego, my mind wasn't at peace.

1544
02:20:45,203 --> 02:20:50,676
When I faced the turmoil of whether my
ego is bigger than the loss of Saanvi,

1545
02:20:53,478 --> 02:20:57,153
her diary answered my questions...

1546
02:21:05,824 --> 02:21:09,499
Had Saanvi been there today, she'd have
been 25.

1547
02:21:11,830 --> 02:21:17,644
We've tried recreating all her memories in
this room.

1548
02:22:32,944 --> 02:22:33,922
No I won't give this back to you.

1549
02:22:43,054 --> 02:22:47,592
Most pages in her book have been
dedicated to you.

1550
02:22:47,593 --> 02:22:52,008
She was trying to explore another side to
you.

1551
02:23:25,230 --> 02:23:28,177
Mummy this toy is broken...

1552
02:23:42,748 --> 02:23:43,590
Brother!!

1553
02:23:45,250 --> 02:23:48,697
You will not change in this lifetime! is this
the only way for survival?

1554
02:23:49,254 --> 02:23:50,995
There are so many ways to lead a dignified
life.

1555
02:23:56,294 --> 02:24:00,401
You have no dignity left, but at least think
of the future of your child.

1556
02:24:01,366 --> 02:24:02,970
If you keep entertaining men...

1557
02:24:03,135 --> 02:24:04,835
Sister.

1558
02:24:04,836 --> 02:24:07,939
Sister, I forgot to give the chocolate I got
for your little one!

1559
02:24:07,940 --> 02:24:10,443
I can't come in because I'm wearing my
shoes

1560
02:24:12,744 --> 02:24:16,886
Please don't miss my wedding...the
address is in the invitation card.

1561
02:24:18,884 --> 02:24:19,862
Please sit, brother

1562
02:24:23,888 --> 02:24:24,866
Here, take this...

1563
02:24:26,858 --> 02:24:29,960
Even though it's been four years since I
gave up my old ways,

1564
02:24:29,961 --> 02:24:34,000
my neighbours still view me with suspicion.

1565
02:24:35,734 --> 02:24:37,645
Please don't feel bad about what you just
said. It's okay...

1566
02:24:38,336 --> 02:24:40,816
You weren't aware that I have started my
life anew

1567
02:24:41,840 --> 02:24:43,945
one minute...let me get you some coffee...

1568
02:24:47,045 --> 02:24:50,280
I earn about 6 thousand rupees from doing
household work...

1569
02:24:50,281 --> 02:24:52,352
I'm managing with that money...

1570
02:24:53,084 --> 02:24:55,064
Uncle, please open this wrapper...

1571
02:24:55,253 --> 02:24:57,426
Baby, don't disturb uncle.

1572
02:24:58,056 --> 02:25:00,424
I'm somehow managing to hold on with
these earnings...

1573
02:25:00,425 --> 02:25:03,201
but I have to admit her to school next year

1574
02:25:04,996 --> 02:25:05,940
What's your name?

1575
02:25:19,177 --> 02:25:20,747
How many cigarettes do you smoke in a
day?

1576
02:25:23,214 --> 02:25:24,415
Where were you all this while?

1577
02:25:24,416 --> 02:25:26,362
I asked you how many cigarettes do you
smoke in a day?

1578
02:25:26,852 --> 02:25:30,732
I searched around for you...you weren't
there...l came away...

1579
02:25:31,089 --> 02:25:33,797
Dude, I asked you how many cigarettes do
you smoke in a day?? Tell me correctly.

1580
02:25:36,027 --> 02:25:37,199
Two packs

1581
02:25:37,429 --> 02:25:39,067
Two packs??

1582
02:25:40,232 --> 02:25:42,109
20 cigarettes.

1583
02:25:43,268 --> 02:25:47,478
Even if it costs you 200 bucks a day, it will
total upto 6000 bucks a month!

1584
02:26:01,820 --> 02:26:04,198
Kama, I have to tell you something.

1585
02:26:05,323 --> 02:26:06,199
What?

1586
02:26:13,365 --> 02:26:15,367
I'll tell you tomorrow.

1587
02:26:32,016 --> 02:26:33,495
How did it land in your answer sheet?

1588
02:26:36,087 --> 02:26:38,455
Sir, both Mahesh and I have written the
same answers.

1589
02:26:38,456 --> 02:26:41,494
Yet, you've given him 24 and 14 to me.

1590
02:26:43,928 --> 02:26:46,397
Both of you were sitting in different classes
to write the exam.

1591
02:26:46,398 --> 02:26:48,866
How did both of you end up wiring the
same answers?

1592
02:26:48,867 --> 02:26:50,847
That, too word to word!

1593
02:26:53,371 --> 02:26:57,285
Look, whichever word he has scratched
out, you've scratched out the same.

1594
02:26:59,211 --> 02:27:00,644
Thought it'd look natural...

1595
02:27:00,645 --> 02:27:01,453
Your head!!

1596
02:27:08,587 --> 02:27:09,420
Jnanesh,

1597
02:27:09,421 --> 02:27:14,530
Have you read the article that sir has
written in the college magazine?

1598
02:27:15,827 --> 02:27:18,137
No! I haven't! In fact, that's the only one I'm
yet to read.

1599
02:27:33,645 --> 02:27:35,479
I told you...we've been friends for eight
years.

1600
02:27:35,480 --> 02:27:37,585
Look at how he came at the right time and
saved us!

1601
02:27:38,283 --> 02:27:39,387
He's amazing!

1602
02:27:41,119 --> 02:27:44,157
What's up Sankoch? Ready with your
farewell speech?

1603
02:27:45,123 --> 02:27:46,256
Please include us in your speech, too.

1604
02:27:46,257 --> 02:27:49,067
Don't forget that we were all thick friends at
one point.

1605
02:27:49,694 --> 02:27:52,436
So wasn't it you guys who locked up the
prinicpal in the car?

1606
02:27:55,900 --> 02:27:58,141
Did you tell him? Idiot!

1607
02:27:58,870 --> 02:28:00,237
Loki and gang have been rusticated.

1608
02:28:00,238 --> 02:28:02,650
They will not get admission in any college
after this.

1609
02:28:03,275 --> 02:28:04,875
As a friend, let me tell you one thing.

1610
02:28:04,876 --> 02:28:08,545
Go and accept your mistake. Don't spoil
their life.

1611
02:28:08,546 --> 02:28:10,355
So our lives won't be spoilt is it?

1612
02:28:10,582 --> 02:28:14,189
So you mean to say that it's ok for us to be
in trouble?

1613
02:28:14,719 --> 02:28:17,563
How many times have they got us into
trouble earlier! Let them face it now.

1614
02:28:18,289 --> 02:28:23,289
I didn't mean it that way. Please try to
undenstand what I'm trying to say...

1615
02:28:23,662 --> 02:28:26,196
Shut up!

1616
02:28:26,197 --> 02:28:27,175
Kama!

1617
02:28:29,200 --> 02:28:33,342
Go and accept your mistake Karna.

1618
02:28:35,240 --> 02:28:37,541
By staying mum, you're committing a
bigger mistake.

1619
02:28:37,542 --> 02:28:40,010
Because of you, your friends' lives will also
be spoilt.

1620
02:28:40,011 --> 02:28:42,613
Which friends? None of those guys are my
friends

1621
02:28:42,614 --> 02:28:44,616
These guys are my real buddies.

1622
02:28:46,618 --> 02:28:48,285
Come lets go.

1623
02:28:48,286 --> 02:28:48,986
Beat him up...

1624
02:28:48,987 --> 02:28:51,722
Him and Sankock are both in it together...

1625
02:28:51,723 --> 02:28:52,929
Where's Kama?

1626
02:28:54,126 --> 02:28:55,192
He was around here...

1627
02:28:55,193 --> 02:28:56,501
I think he's gone back to the hostel

1628
02:29:20,085 --> 02:29:25,085
ls it time for me to set sail on a paper boat?

1629
02:29:27,959 --> 02:29:35,673
Has an unseen tear sat ensconced as a
pearl in my eye?

1630
02:29:39,337 --> 02:29:43,607
Can my heavy heart be unburdened?

1631
02:29:43,608 --> 02:29:48,148
Is it possible to seek familiar shores?

1632
02:29:50,415 --> 02:29:54,218
Will the path ahead look upon me kindly?

1633
02:29:54,219 --> 02:29:57,755
And surpass my imagination?

1634
02:29:57,756 --> 02:30:06,301
And also show me some love?

1635
02:30:42,400 --> 02:30:45,404
It's 5 am as I'm writing this...

1636
02:30:46,838 --> 02:30:50,012
one one side, the sun's rays are dipping
and dusk is setting in...

1637
02:30:51,176 --> 02:30:56,216
on the other side, the night brings a
content smile on my face which refuses to
tadeuu

1638
02:30:57,315 --> 02:31:01,764
Only a few people can manage to bring a
smile on other people's faces...

1639
02:31:02,687 --> 02:31:05,793
I'm glad I met one of them...Karna...

1640
02:31:07,792 --> 02:31:11,638
No matter how mischievous he may seem,
there's an innocence in his eyes...

1641
02:31:15,266 --> 02:31:18,402
While I set out to explore another side to
him,

1642
02:31:18,403 --> 02:31:21,111
Karna ended up showing me a whole new
dimension to my personality

1643
02:31:21,806 --> 02:31:24,787
As we mature, so do our thoughts...

1644
02:31:25,343 --> 02:31:30,349
You start thinking that you're mature and
can't afford to act childish anymore...

1645
02:31:32,484 --> 02:31:35,431
We try to hide all our childish desires...

1646
02:31:36,187 --> 02:31:40,192
Tonight, having been with him, I feel like a
child again...

1647
02:32:08,286 --> 02:32:13,286
On my shoulder hangs a bag of my
memories

1648
02:32:16,727 --> 02:32:21,727
A bridge made of a thousand unspoken
words lies ahead of me

1649
02:32:24,469 --> 02:32:29,469
The rains threaten to wipe away my
footsteps

1650
02:32:32,843 --> 02:32:37,843
I long to return to a life of innocence in your
arms

1651
02:32:41,152 --> 02:32:45,556
My heart is filled with generosity

1652
02:32:45,557 --> 02:32:50,336
And I hope to now find my way home

1653
02:33:15,487 --> 02:33:18,989
Unopened doors lie ahead

1654
02:33:18,990 --> 02:33:22,893
New roads lies ahead

1655
02:33:22,894 --> 02:33:29,539
Unspoken silence lie ahead

1656
02:33:44,682 --> 02:33:48,552
2.45 lakes? That's a good amount!

1657
02:33:48,553 --> 02:33:51,466
We should not have taken our share back
from Kama,
when he was going through tough times.

1658
02:33:54,025 --> 02:33:58,495
We still haven't heard from him...will tell
you when we get to know...

1659
02:33:58,496 --> 02:34:06,574
Arial

1660
02:34:13,545 --> 02:34:14,878
Where have you disappeared?

1661
02:34:14,879 --> 02:34:17,359
The buyer is pestering me to take the
payment and give him the car...

1662
02:34:22,386 --> 02:34:24,521
Ok take the money and give him the car.

1663
02:34:24,522 --> 02:34:26,590
I'll hand over the documents once I'm
back.

1664
02:34:26,591 --> 02:34:27,501
What should I do with the money?

1665
02:34:28,493 --> 02:34:29,059
Open an FD

1666
02:34:29,060 --> 02:34:30,801
An FD? In whose name?

1667
02:34:32,697 --> 02:34:34,097
Madam, we need your signature here

1668
02:34:34,098 --> 02:34:35,338
Sign here.

1669
02:34:39,637 --> 02:34:43,813
Mom, when will you send me to school?

1670
02:35:35,493 --> 02:35:36,665
Guys, his phone is ringing!

1671
02:35:38,129 --> 02:35:39,529
Where are you?

1672
02:35:39,530 --> 02:35:40,363
When did you come back?

1673
02:35:40,364 --> 02:35:41,570
I'm in the hostel

1674
02:35:41,933 --> 02:35:43,537
Alex: You're in the hostel? What are you
doing there?

1675
02:35:43,968 --> 02:35:45,935
L'm writing a letter. Will call you later.

1676
02:35:45,936 --> 02:35:48,041
Listen dude, we're all at the auditorium

1677
02:36:35,219 --> 02:36:36,562
Give this letter to Arya

1678
02:36:48,533 --> 02:36:49,705
Karna, where were you all these days?

1679
02:36:50,101 --> 02:36:52,911
Did it take you this long to shave ofi your
beard?

1680
02:36:52,970 --> 02:36:54,142
Ok come, everyone's waiting in the
auditorium.

1681
02:36:55,973 --> 02:36:56,917
What's that letter?

1682
02:37:08,486 --> 02:37:10,432
Why the hell have they put the names of
these boys?

1683
02:37:11,622 --> 02:37:14,125
They've all been given an early farewell by
the principal, dude!

1684
02:37:30,941 --> 02:37:32,142
Four years!

1685
02:37:32,143 --> 02:37:33,543
Sir, I've been here for eight years!

1686
02:37:33,544 --> 02:37:34,211
I've been here for six years sir!

1687
02:37:34,212 --> 02:37:37,022
You all must be wondering how those four
years have passed by

1688
02:37:38,049 --> 02:37:39,460
But the fact is that

1689
02:37:39,817 --> 02:37:44,596
I know how each one of you have spent
the last four years here.

1690
02:37:53,230 --> 02:37:56,871
You all are set to become engineers
and contribute your knowledge to the
society.

1691
02:37:58,836 --> 02:38:03,148
Just for today, I will spare you all and will
not talk too much.

1692
02:38:17,621 --> 02:38:18,793
Four years!

1693
02:38:19,256 --> 02:38:24,137
We've spent the last tour years wondering,
when we will we complete our course and
get out of this college.

1694
02:38:24,562 --> 02:38:26,196
But today, the day has finally come.

1695
02:38:26,197 --> 02:38:30,509
And we want this college life to extend for
a few more days..

1696
02:38:30,968 --> 02:38:34,006
I'm sure all of you are of the same thought

1697
02:39:10,140 --> 02:39:15,140
I once recited a story that's full of sweet
memories of college...

1698
02:39:16,080 --> 02:39:21,080
carved on classroom benches and the
walls of the corridor...

1699
02:39:23,054 --> 02:39:26,756
we are still not satiated

1700
02:39:26,757 --> 02:39:32,764
so many fond memories that I need to find
new places to etch them...

1701
02:39:46,877 --> 02:39:50,120
Let's quickly rewind the memories of the
last four years...

1702
02:39:55,286 --> 02:40:00,929
Two previous classes have already been
mass bunked by us

1703
02:40:00,991 --> 02:40:05,235
We are now facing an attendance shortage
due to the lack of proxy

1704
02:40:06,664 --> 02:40:11,340
The marks scored by us during exams are
missing on our report cards

1705
02:40:12,203 --> 02:40:21,055
But I'm sure we will clear a couple of
papers during the revals

1706
02:40:23,381 --> 02:40:28,228
The innumerable joys
all these years have brought

1707
02:40:28,719 --> 02:40:34,795
may they stay with us eternally

1708
02:40:56,714 --> 02:40:58,415
We were with you during the good times.

1709
02:40:58,416 --> 02:41:01,158
Now when you're off to face the music
for the bad deeds, you want to do it alone?

1710
02:41:01,452 --> 02:41:03,053
We've been seeing you for the past four
years.

1711
02:41:03,054 --> 02:41:04,421
Don't we know what you'll be upto?

1712
02:41:04,422 --> 02:41:07,369
I've not included your names in this. It's
only mine.

1713
02:41:08,358 --> 02:41:11,669
All you have to do is add five more names.
Thats it!

1714
02:41:14,832 --> 02:41:15,810
Why did you guys bring your luggage?

1715
02:41:16,300 --> 02:41:18,644
We are all extremely positive about being
sent home!

1716
02:41:19,370 --> 02:41:20,348
Then what about mine?

1717
02:41:21,305 --> 02:41:23,876
We've got that, too!

1718
02:41:26,977 --> 02:41:30,080
Give me that bag. I'll fetch an auto and
load our luggage into it.

1719
02:41:30,081 --> 02:41:31,253
You guys carry on with your talks.

1720
02:41:32,049 --> 02:41:32,482
Come, lets go

1721
02:41:32,483 --> 02:41:33,223
Arial

1722
02:41:37,755 --> 02:41:38,699
What's that?

1723
02:41:38,923 --> 02:41:40,163
Sir, apology letter

1724
02:41:41,392 --> 02:41:41,961
Ok

1725
02:41:43,160 --> 02:41:45,401
Sir, it'd be better it you could read the letter
once

1726
02:41:45,830 --> 02:41:49,403
You must've written that you were the guys
who sneaked into my home and put me in
the car boot, isn't it?

1727
02:41:52,836 --> 02:41:55,043
You guys are in this college for the last four
years only.

1728
02:41:56,140 --> 02:41:58,017
I've been seeing students for the last 25
years.

1729
02:41:59,110 --> 02:42:02,819
I've seen better students than you
and also the ones who're worse than you.

1730
02:42:03,514 --> 02:42:06,723
I've seen them all become responsible
adults alter gelling a job.

1731
02:42:07,218 --> 02:42:11,257
This is not a jail to punish you. It's a
college.

1732
02:42:12,189 --> 02:42:16,501
Sir, but I heard Loki and his gang have
been rusticated...

1733
02:42:16,794 --> 02:42:19,900
None of them have been rusticated. They
must be in the auditorium.

1734
02:42:29,340 --> 02:42:34,340
I once recited a story that's full of sweet
memories of college...

1735
02:42:34,378 --> 02:42:41,159
carved on classroom benches and the
walls of the corridor...

1736
02:42:42,253 --> 02:42:45,359
we are still not satiated

1737
02:42:46,156 --> 02:42:52,072
so many fond memories that I need to find
new places to etch them...

1738
02:43:07,611 --> 02:43:12,611
Aren't quarrels a pan of friendship?

1739
02:43:13,150 --> 02:43:17,997
Compromise and understand that in unity
lies strength

1740
02:43:18,522 --> 02:43:23,522
One or two strikes are essential in the
name oi social cause

1741
02:43:23,527 --> 02:43:31,344
Seems like our time in college will not
suffice,
so let us buy a site on the campus

1742
02:44:05,002 --> 02:44:06,242
Were you the one locked up my dad in the
car?

1743
02:44:08,171 --> 02:44:09,343
Ermm...that day...

1744
02:44:12,142 --> 02:44:14,554
You're humble enough to accept your
mistakes...

1745
02:44:15,246 --> 02:44:16,452
you're such a good person!

1746
02:44:17,681 --> 02:44:19,082
Now go give this letter to the principal!

1747
02:44:19,083 --> 02:44:20,858
To the principal? Why?

1748
02:44:21,418 --> 02:44:24,126
You've addressed it to the principal,
so go give it to him. lt won't be nice if I give
it to him.

1749
02:44:26,891 --> 02:44:28,871
It's addressed to the principal? Give it
here!

1750
02:44:33,597 --> 02:44:36,499
Dude, it this this your apology letter,

1751
02:44:36,500 --> 02:44:38,446
Then what letter did you give to the
principal??
