DesaMuduru DVDRip

2
00:00:51,618 --> 00:00:57,750
Do it... do it... 
dazzle with your eyes... 

3
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:04,757
Do it... again... 
slap it tight with hand... 

4
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:13,096
Lord Muruga!
Why do people betray me?

5
00:01:14,874 --> 00:01:18,935
Hey... where is he?

6
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:21,744
I don't know boss,
it's been long time since I met him.

7
00:01:22,048 --> 00:01:22,514
Tell me.

8
00:01:23,483 --> 00:01:24,575
Tell me I say.

9
00:01:25,285 --> 00:01:25,808
Tell me the truth.

10
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:27,018
Truest me I don't know, boss.

11
00:01:27,487 --> 00:01:30,149
But he asked to meet him tomorrow.
-Where?

12
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:33,924
Pochamma temple... 
he invited me there.

13
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,458
What are you both planning to do?
Kill me?

14
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:37,991
Will you kill me?

15
00:01:39,132 --> 00:01:40,429
Tell me, you bastard.

16
00:01:41,067 --> 00:01:42,329
Tell me. Hold it tight.

17
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:47,868
Boss... don't kill me... 

18
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:55,546
Kill him... says don't kill him.

19
00:02:04,357 --> 00:02:05,187
Who is your favorite hero?

20
00:02:05,492 --> 00:02:08,188
If you're local goons,

21
00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:11,692
I'm Don of Nizam, Fief of Rayalaseema,
Hooligan of Andhra,

22
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:13,432
totally I'm the Big Boss
of this entire state.

23
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,767
Megastar!

24
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:19,166
If you shout at me, I'll bite you.
I'll arrest you also, be careful!

25
00:02:19,405 --> 00:02:21,737
I entered your town,
your home, your hall,

26
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:25,640
if you're a man,
if your moustache is real,

27
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,044
let me see what you can do?

28
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:29,611
I like Jagapathi Babu.

29
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:31,441
In fact I love him.

30
00:02:31,851 --> 00:02:34,285
I wish for such a husband.

31
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:36,020
When he walks, he's mass.

32
00:02:36,222 --> 00:02:37,553
When he stands, he's mass.

33
00:02:37,757 --> 00:02:40,021
When he looks, he's mass.

34
00:02:40,393 --> 00:02:41,223
Dance buddy!

35
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:45,925
I like Srikanth.

36
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:47,826
I love his chubby cheeks.

37
00:02:48,434 --> 00:02:51,335
I don't change words
whether I promise or not.

38
00:02:52,238 --> 00:02:54,638
I'm Chatrapathi!

39
00:03:00,446 --> 00:03:04,041
If the three lions on my emblem
represent truth, justice and duty,

40
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:06,115
police is the fourth lion
not seen in it.

41
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:07,946
I wasn't born a family of cowards,

42
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:09,818
I was born in a family of warriors.

43
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:13,084
Mother promise, I'll cut you into two.

44
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:17,018
The one punch of a man that
will knock you out,

45
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:19,322
he's Mahesh Babu.

46
00:03:19,632 --> 00:03:21,896
Won't Commissioner's daughter marry?

47
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:22,960
Won't they need husband?

48
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:25,664
Commissioners will come
and go to this city,

49
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:27,737
but I'm a local,
I'll always stay here.

50
00:03:28,007 --> 00:03:32,410
If you're Nanda,
I'm Badri... Badrinath!

51
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:35,646
So what? Power Star Pavan Kalyan.

52
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:38,474
Hot ginger tea!

53
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:40,178
Cinema is super hit!

54
00:03:40,453 --> 00:03:42,421
Hero is great, heroine is ravishing,
Director is... 

55
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:46,081
We are not here for cinema report,
we are from Radio Mirchi.- Tell me.

56
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:48,226
Who is your favorite hero?
- I like brother Murthy.

57
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:49,654
Murthy? Which Murthy?

58
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:53,760
The one & only man who makes
films for the oppressed class,

59
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:55,059
our R. Narayanamurthy!

60
00:03:55,768 --> 00:03:59,602
Red flag... red flag is fluttering high... 

61
00:04:00,673 --> 00:04:01,435
Super!
- Thanks.

62
00:04:01,641 --> 00:04:05,304
Have you seen any real life hero
other than the matinee idols?

63
00:04:06,012 --> 00:04:07,377
I did.
-Who?

64
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:09,079
Yesterday only.

65
00:04:10,016 --> 00:04:10,744
Right here!

66
00:04:11,517 --> 00:04:12,211
In this place.

67
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,450
He came from no where
to stop an injustice.

68
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:19,717
His hands turned into fist.

69
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,750
His nerves started bulging.

70
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,988
l saw his powerful laser eyes.

71
00:04:28,568 --> 00:04:30,695
He hit one shot!

72
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:38,367
He came from no where.

73
00:04:38,745 --> 00:04:39,370
Who is he?

74
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:53,983
I dream

75
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:04,102
Lord Ganesha, people call me as ruffian.

76
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,199
Some praise me and some scold me.

77
00:05:06,739 --> 00:05:07,899
But most of them scold me.

78
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:09,739
Why did you make me so clever?

79
00:05:10,276 --> 00:05:11,038
Take back half of it.

80
00:05:11,611 --> 00:05:14,444
Take it back and give me
Rs. 1 billion for it.

81
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:19,018
I want to buy a TV,
not any ordinary colour TV,

82
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:20,909
I want to buy MAA TV channel.

83
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:30,192
Give this to cameraman.

84
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:36,629
Forget it, he's shouting.
- Boss?

85
00:05:36,869 --> 00:05:37,665
No, Mr. Sudharshan.

86
00:05:38,571 --> 00:05:40,334
Our industry is very competitive field,

87
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:43,437
we must produce good programs and
get good name for our channel,

88
00:05:43,776 --> 00:05:46,506
but you mustn't bring disrepute
for your personal behaviour.

89
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:48,207
I think it's madam's phone.

90
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:52,980
Hello Sujatha... I'll get the
clothes from the tailor.

91
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:57,417
Yellow border down and
two flowers upside. Okay.

92
00:05:59,225 --> 00:06:01,693
So stop such personal works.

93
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:04,594
Don't wash dishes and clothes.

94
00:06:04,797 --> 00:06:05,320
I'll not do sir.

95
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:06,327
If possible I'll beat her.

96
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:07,556
If possible kill her.

97
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:12,430
I'll kill... I'll go to Kulu Manali
shoot for a travel program.

98
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:15,037
No, you're in crime section,
stay there.

99
00:06:15,241 --> 00:06:17,300
Don't try to jump towards
devotional and emotional side.

100
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:17,976
Okay sir.

101
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:21,544
Yellow border down & 2 flowers upside,
don't forget madam's order.

102
00:06:21,748 --> 00:06:22,373
I'll take care of it.

103
00:06:22,648 --> 00:06:23,910
What is your native place?

104
00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:24,583
Guntur sir.

105
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:26,809
Are you alone like this or
entire district is like you?

106
00:06:27,286 --> 00:06:28,981
Why are you playing
on my weakness?

107
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:30,550
Go... go.

108
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:31,689
Nephew!
- Uncle!

109
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:34,086
Chandramohan is furious on you.
Go, he's shouting at you.

110
00:06:34,293 --> 00:06:35,851
How can both shout at me?

111
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:37,696
Their positions are different.

112
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:39,626
They must maintain it.

113
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:44,828
Local brew Gudumba sale in city.

114
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:47,866
By 5 p.m. the program will
be on your table.

115
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:49,669
Why are you getting so serious?

116
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:51,935
No sir, sincerity and discipline.

117
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:53,077
My foot discipline.

118
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:56,644
You're calling your father
by name Chandramohan.

119
00:06:57,984 --> 00:06:59,815
Had food? Had milk?

120
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,646
Did you ask God to give Rs. 1 billion?

121
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:04,485
You will ask man, what will you
lose in making a request?

122
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:07,090
Why did you leave your
used brief in bathroom?

123
00:07:07,393 --> 00:07:09,020
If you keep it out,
I can send it to the dry cleaner.

124
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:13,293
A father should be in a position
to feel proud of his son,

125
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:15,827
or he must be in a
position to wet his pants.

126
00:07:16,202 --> 00:07:18,329
I'll see that you're in any one
of this position, give me time,

127
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:19,400
I'll visit Dhoolpet.

128
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:26,838
You go that side, don't create suspicion.

129
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:27,679
Be careful.

130
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:12,282
Don't kill me.

131
00:08:13,893 --> 00:08:23,859
I dream

132
00:08:25,738 --> 00:08:26,636
Come this side.

133
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:31,776
Boss... he's escaping.

134
00:08:32,378 --> 00:08:32,935
Catch him.

135
00:08:40,753 --> 00:08:41,947
Search every place.

136
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:22,318
Who are you?

137
00:09:22,828 --> 00:09:23,817
I don't know who you are,

138
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:25,688
I don't know who this guy is,

139
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:27,827
but killing is crime.

140
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:29,331
Then you'll die.

141
00:09:31,003 --> 00:09:32,265
You'll become a bag of bones.

142
00:09:33,372 --> 00:09:34,703
Your bulbs will get fused.

143
00:09:36,475 --> 00:09:37,237
Kill him boys!

144
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:57,153
Hack him!

145
00:11:16,742 --> 00:11:18,141
His men are coming... escape!

146
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,654
Do you who did beat now?
Thambidurai's son.

147
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:39,162
Do you know who is Thambidurai?

148
00:11:44,136 --> 00:11:45,068
Do you know who is Ponnusamy?

149
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:48,465
They will kill you.

150
00:11:48,674 --> 00:11:49,800
They will cut you into pieces.

151
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:51,972
Where is my dear son?

152
00:11:52,678 --> 00:11:54,873
You went to cover the crime,
not to get involved in crime.

153
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:55,771
Son Murugesan.

154
00:12:10,863 --> 00:12:12,262
Go to some place.

155
00:12:12,531 --> 00:12:14,726
Where can I go suddenly?
- Go to some place,

156
00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:15,525
but don't stay here.

157
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:19,603
Who dared to beat my son?

158
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:24,676
I'll film the travel program.

159
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:28,243
There's another unit for it.
-We'll film it sir.

160
00:12:28,447 --> 00:12:29,971
Please sir, my life is in danger here.

161
00:12:30,282 --> 00:12:31,214
You always put me in fix.

162
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:32,975
Your father is very tensed.

163
00:12:33,352 --> 00:12:34,444
You go to Kulu Manali.

164
00:12:36,055 --> 00:12:36,714
Who is he?

165
00:12:37,022 --> 00:12:38,819
He works for MAA TV.
- Come on boys.

166
00:12:39,024 --> 00:12:42,152
If they come here for me,
don't tell him he's my father.

167
00:12:51,737 --> 00:12:52,533
What happened sir?

168
00:12:52,838 --> 00:12:54,305
Where is Bala Govind?

169
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:57,371
He might have ran away from
the place after trouble there.

170
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:01,913
Where is he? Where will he be?
- I don't know sir.

171
00:13:02,915 --> 00:13:05,884
I want Bala Govind's head and limbs.

172
00:13:06,218 --> 00:13:07,412
I'll intimate as soon as he comes.

173
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,187
Where is his family?

174
00:13:09,421 --> 00:13:11,184
He's a bachelor,
he doesn't have a family.

175
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:12,886
He might've escaped.

176
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:15,319
Where can he escape?

177
00:13:16,328 --> 00:13:20,958
Search bus stations,
railway stations, entire city,

178
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:22,065
we mustn't spare him.

179
00:13:22,935 --> 00:13:24,402
Come... come fast.

180
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:38,279
Get in quickly.

181
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,356
Thank God!
We have reached Kulu Manali.

182
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:57,866
Incidents leading to this trip
is scaring me, nephew.

183
00:13:58,137 --> 00:14:00,571
If they get hold of you,
they will kill you.

184
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:12,541
I dream

185
00:14:24,897 --> 00:14:26,956
If you die... 

186
00:14:28,133 --> 00:14:31,660
If you die... 

187
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:38,135
If you die... 

188
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:41,179
If you die there's no more trouble... 

189
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,972
if you die no more problems... 

190
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:45,150
Death is inevitable
to all living creatures... 

191
00:14:46,752 --> 00:14:50,552
There's nothing in
living long like crows... 

192
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:52,714
Live like a Swan... 

193
00:14:53,993 --> 00:14:57,929
Find a meaning to
this beautiful life... 

194
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:00,963
Stand tall among a crowd... 

195
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:34,389
I dream

196
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:47,477
Do a mistake everyday... 

197
00:15:47,846 --> 00:15:49,370
Give time till then... 

198
00:15:49,648 --> 00:15:52,776
It's wrong to commit
same mistake again... 

199
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:56,650
It's sin to never commit a mistake... 

200
00:15:57,056 --> 00:16:00,355
It's mistake to feel you
know everything... 

201
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:04,195
Do whatever you do
with commitment... 

202
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:07,829
Let your enthusiasm
rock the sky... 

203
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:11,599
Show your power to the world... 

204
00:16:12,204 --> 00:16:15,196
Like thunder... and lightning... 

205
00:16:15,774 --> 00:16:19,266
March ahead shattering
the world... 

206
00:16:40,065 --> 00:16:50,031
I dream

207
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:14,355
The world is beautiful... 

208
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,190
It's your fault if you
miss to see it... 

209
00:17:16,568 --> 00:17:19,765
If there's no day and night,
time will not move... 

210
00:17:20,272 --> 00:17:23,435
Without sorrows and loss,
it's not a life... 

211
00:17:23,942 --> 00:17:27,309
If you're like others,
there's no fun in life... 

212
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:31,015
Isn't it bore to live a life
lived by all others?

213
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:34,786
If you don't have any work,
spend it gossiping... 

214
00:17:34,987 --> 00:17:38,582
If a look can work wonders,
then go ahead... 

215
00:17:39,024 --> 00:17:41,959
Let victory be your clarion call... 

216
00:17:42,694 --> 00:17:46,186
Live like a King... 

217
00:18:16,462 --> 00:18:18,953
Girls are sleeping in their
own sleeping bags.

218
00:18:19,331 --> 00:18:20,491
Why do they come out then?

219
00:18:22,701 --> 00:18:24,726
Manager, wake up the girls.

220
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:26,336
Girls get up!

221
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:28,569
Don't sleep on each other.

222
00:18:29,007 --> 00:18:29,564
Are they sleeping like that?

223
00:18:32,644 --> 00:18:34,236
With snow clad mountains
surrounding you... 

224
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:36,573
Put on the make up fast,
shooting is getting delayed.

225
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,613
Sit properly and get it done.

226
00:18:39,251 --> 00:18:41,276
Bala look, a bevy of beauties.

227
00:18:46,758 --> 00:18:47,315
Who are they?

228
00:18:51,797 --> 00:19:01,763
I dream

229
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:26,794
Mother!

230
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:30,725
A young man has come.

231
00:19:37,142 --> 00:19:38,734
Who are you son?
What do you want?

232
00:19:39,044 --> 00:19:40,909
Greetings mother,
my name is Bala Govind.

233
00:19:41,113 --> 00:19:42,740
I'm from Guntur.
- I'm from Ananthapuram.

234
00:19:42,981 --> 00:19:43,447
Is it?

235
00:19:44,116 --> 00:19:46,584
I want to know who
you are all, mother?

236
00:19:46,885 --> 00:19:48,546
Sanyasins!

237
00:19:48,887 --> 00:19:50,081
Mata Shivani.
- Mother!

238
00:19:53,725 --> 00:19:54,657
What do you want son?

239
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,521
We have come for a travel
program film shoot.

240
00:19:57,462 --> 00:19:57,928
Your names?

241
00:19:58,564 --> 00:19:59,690
My name is Ramaprabha.

242
00:19:59,898 --> 00:20:01,331
I'm Mata Shivani.

243
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:04,128
She's Saraswathi... 

244
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,935
What's that girl's name?
-Vaishali.

245
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:14,978
She's... ?
- From Bengal.

246
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:15,874
Bengali!

247
00:20:16,348 --> 00:20:17,315
Doesn't know Telugu?

248
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:19,143
Do you know Bengali?
- No.

249
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:20,978
She too doesn't know Telugu.

250
00:20:21,186 --> 00:20:22,414
If I want to communicate with her?

251
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:24,987
Whatever it is tell me.

252
00:20:27,526 --> 00:20:30,495
All are okay except that lady,
she's too fast.

253
00:20:30,696 --> 00:20:32,323
Looks like a Chinese breed.

254
00:20:55,554 --> 00:21:01,857
Hail Lord Shiva! 'Gudumba' Shankar!
-What's that?

255
00:21:03,395 --> 00:21:05,863
We have reached Manali.
-Who are these guys?

256
00:21:09,067 --> 00:21:10,364
He appears like a Pavan Kalyan fan.

257
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:12,036
Come, let's interview him.
- Greetings sir.

258
00:21:12,237 --> 00:21:12,703
May God bless you.

259
00:21:12,904 --> 00:21:15,372
We are from MAA TV,
do you know Pavan Kalyan?

260
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:19,202
Who is Pavan Kalyan?
- He's Power Star in Telugu films.

261
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:22,810
Telugu? I'm also a Telugu.

262
00:21:23,081 --> 00:21:23,877
Swami!

263
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:30,717
I think he became saint when
Pavan was a little boy.- Shut up.

264
00:21:30,922 --> 00:21:32,890
Swami... your name?

265
00:21:33,091 --> 00:21:36,060
'Gudumba' Shankar.

266
00:21:36,928 --> 00:21:40,056
Swami, we want to interview you,

267
00:21:40,265 --> 00:21:42,733
we want to know what made
you to become a monk.

268
00:21:42,934 --> 00:21:43,400
Please sit down.

269
00:21:43,602 --> 00:21:46,571
My life has enough material for
a daily mega soap opera.

270
00:21:46,772 --> 00:21:49,172
Epics Ramayanam & Mahabharata
are nothing before it.

271
00:21:49,608 --> 00:21:53,066
Shocks, shrieks,
twists, bombardments,

272
00:21:53,278 --> 00:21:57,305
every scene is thrilling like climax.
- Tell us your tale sir.

273
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:00,315
Switch off the camera.
-Why?

274
00:22:00,619 --> 00:22:03,588
Give me Rs. 1000, I'll tell you.
- Give him, Manager.

275
00:22:03,955 --> 00:22:05,422
Accept it Swami.

276
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,084
It was year 1996,

277
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:12,927
I was working for a Bank,

278
00:22:14,566 --> 00:22:15,760
ours was a love marriage,

279
00:22:17,302 --> 00:22:18,428
a beautiful wife..

280
00:22:23,975 --> 00:22:26,205
What's that sound?
- I went for a jog.

281
00:22:26,578 --> 00:22:34,586
I dream

282
00:22:34,586 --> 00:22:35,450
Who are you?

283
00:22:36,588 --> 00:22:37,612
They kidnapped me.

284
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:42,126
Who are they?

285
00:22:43,595 --> 00:22:46,462
Didn't you get me? Native of?
- Srikakulam.

286
00:22:48,066 --> 00:22:51,035
We must get Rs. 50 millions
ransom in 24 hours.

287
00:22:51,503 --> 00:22:54,131
How can a Bank employee
have millions of rupees?

288
00:22:54,339 --> 00:22:55,465
I too asked the same point.

289
00:22:56,274 --> 00:22:59,641
I can't arrange the funds even
if you give 24 years.-Why?

290
00:23:02,848 --> 00:23:04,145
Later they came to know.

291
00:23:05,283 --> 00:23:09,151
By mistake they kidnapped me
instead of real estate Shankar.

292
00:23:10,956 --> 00:23:13,823
Sorry, we made a mistake.
- Don't feel.

293
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:15,485
We have come a long way.

294
00:23:17,362 --> 00:23:19,489
Sleep here tonight and
leave tomorrow morning.

295
00:23:19,865 --> 00:23:20,991
I'll drop you, okay?

296
00:23:22,033 --> 00:23:25,594
My mistake was to sleep
like a log that night.

297
00:23:26,037 --> 00:23:26,833
What happened then sir?

298
00:23:28,306 --> 00:23:29,170
I'll tell next time.

299
00:23:29,641 --> 00:23:32,337
Because every scene is
thrilling like climax,

300
00:23:33,612 --> 00:23:37,776
that too only if you shell out Rs. 1000.
It's daily serial scheme, got it?

301
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:46,849
Why do you think she has
become a sanyasin?

302
00:23:47,058 --> 00:23:50,186
What else?
She would've married a fool,

303
00:23:50,562 --> 00:23:51,688
and may have had 4 children,

304
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:54,027
got fed up with life to
become a sanyasin.

305
00:23:54,232 --> 00:23:57,201
You dark fool!
I'm talking about Vaishali.

306
00:23:57,469 --> 00:23:59,528
Sorry buddy, I thought Ramaprabha.

307
00:24:06,478 --> 00:24:07,638
How nice it is!

308
00:24:08,914 --> 00:24:11,781
If you boil it well, it'll be good.
-You want rice? - No.

309
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:15,985
What are you talking about?
- Potato.

310
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:33,571
I must trap her.

311
00:24:54,025 --> 00:25:03,991
I dream

312
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:20,712
Who is that?

313
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:24,315
Hello Prabha, I'm Bala Govind.
- Is it you?

314
00:25:27,726 --> 00:25:30,194
Your cave is fantastic!

315
00:25:30,495 --> 00:25:32,554
What brings you here?
- For you.

316
00:25:32,764 --> 00:25:35,130
We are TV media people,
we are curious to know you.

317
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:36,459
What is your religion madam?

318
00:25:37,002 --> 00:25:38,469
Ours is not a religion.

319
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:40,967
Not adhered to any particular religion.

320
00:25:41,673 --> 00:25:42,970
Ours is a community, that's all.

321
00:25:43,174 --> 00:25:44,641
Which God do you pray?

322
00:25:47,112 --> 00:25:52,812
We used to pray Lord Ganesha,
Lord Venkateshwara & Goddess Alamelumanga.

323
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:55,144
Mother.

324
00:25:55,453 --> 00:25:57,148
The cave is resounding with your voice.

325
00:25:57,355 --> 00:25:58,322
Sorry mother.

326
00:25:59,524 --> 00:26:00,491
We believe in God.

327
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:05,090
Our God has no form, no name.
We meditate.

328
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:08,158
Meditation doesn't need any religion.

329
00:26:08,366 --> 00:26:11,824
What else do you want to know?
-Where do you live?

330
00:26:12,037 --> 00:26:15,495
In an Ashram near by... 
- I'll meet you there.

331
00:26:15,707 --> 00:26:17,334
You mustn't come there also.

332
00:26:17,542 --> 00:26:20,010
Don't stop me madam.
I love Sanyasis.

333
00:26:20,211 --> 00:26:22,907
There's a Ashram for Sanyasis,
join them.

334
00:26:23,281 --> 00:26:26,842
No madam, you've mistaken me... 
- Look son, I've been watching you,

335
00:26:27,052 --> 00:26:30,351
your concentration is wandering.
-Yes.

336
00:26:30,555 --> 00:26:35,686
You say travels, TV program but
concentrating on something else.

337
00:26:35,894 --> 00:26:36,861
Look at me not there, son.

338
00:26:37,729 --> 00:26:39,196
We want to meditate.

339
00:26:39,397 --> 00:26:41,524
You carry on.
I don't have any objection.

340
00:26:41,733 --> 00:26:46,193
Shivani, show him to the door.
- Come... come... 

341
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:51,707
Let's meet again.
- Let's go out, you'll get fresh air.

342
00:26:54,179 --> 00:26:56,044
You can go without staring her.

343
00:27:04,589 --> 00:27:05,556
How does he look like?

344
00:27:05,757 --> 00:27:07,884
Nothing really awesome.
Just average.

345
00:27:08,593 --> 00:27:13,724
I didn't ask if he's handsome.
Is he tall?

346
00:27:13,932 --> 00:27:16,958
No, he's very short compared
to our boss. Average height.

347
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:23,069
Is he very huge?
- He's not fat, just average.

348
00:27:23,341 --> 00:27:27,903
But his punches are not average,
he's in coma.

349
00:27:29,514 --> 00:27:32,745
Coma is not average.

350
00:27:37,389 --> 00:27:39,653
We can't say anything
till next 24 hours.

351
00:27:41,793 --> 00:27:44,261
If you come with such news again,

352
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:49,360
I don't know what I'll do with you.
You got me?

353
00:28:02,313 --> 00:28:09,446
Hey Policeman! Don't stare at us.

354
00:28:09,654 --> 00:28:10,951
Don't stare at me.

355
00:28:11,156 --> 00:28:17,959
Catch the dog who beat my son.
- Bring him. Go... go man.

356
00:28:18,329 --> 00:28:19,796
I can understand Tamil very well,

357
00:28:19,998 --> 00:28:21,966
I must learn Tamil before
he gets discharged.

358
00:28:23,334 --> 00:28:26,030
We have many relations in this world,

359
00:28:26,337 --> 00:28:28,362
mother & father, brother & sister,

360
00:28:28,606 --> 00:28:30,801
friends, many like this.

361
00:28:31,176 --> 00:28:37,706
The weakest relationship
is husband & wife.

362
00:28:38,349 --> 00:28:42,979
It is weakest, that's why
we have a divorce.

363
00:28:43,354 --> 00:28:48,656
But it depends on the man,
so we have to keep it safe.

364
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:53,320
Live here... die here... 

365
00:28:55,633 --> 00:28:57,328
What are you doing?
-Washing.

366
00:28:57,535 --> 00:28:59,162
Why?
- To boil it.

367
00:28:59,704 --> 00:29:02,502
We eat only this. Just herbs,
leaves and vegetables.

368
00:29:02,707 --> 00:29:03,731
What about chicken and mutton?

369
00:29:04,209 --> 00:29:06,837
Don't mention them, I'll start crying.

370
00:29:07,378 --> 00:29:10,347
I used to eat only non-vegetarian food.

371
00:29:10,782 --> 00:29:13,080
I never ate without mutton.

372
00:29:13,384 --> 00:29:17,343
I've become pure vegetarian here.
- So sad.

373
00:29:17,722 --> 00:29:20,350
Why did you become a sanyasin?

374
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:27,020
l asked my husband to buy
a costly silk sari for me,

375
00:29:27,232 --> 00:29:28,859
he refused. That's why.

376
00:29:29,067 --> 00:29:30,034
For such a silly matter?

377
00:29:30,735 --> 00:29:33,636
This is not silly matter,
it's a big issue.

378
00:29:49,187 --> 00:29:53,214
In my time I've never seen
so much of desire in eyes.

379
00:29:53,424 --> 00:29:59,056
Nothing like that madam, I was
watching her casually drying clothes.

380
00:29:59,264 --> 00:30:01,562
We suspect you're looking
at sensitive places.

381
00:30:01,766 --> 00:30:04,064
Oh my God! What a nasty accusation.

382
00:30:04,269 --> 00:30:06,237
l came here to film your Ashram.

383
00:30:06,437 --> 00:30:09,565
Come on boys, film it fast,
getting madam's permission is rare.

384
00:30:09,774 --> 00:30:11,571
Take good shots. What do you think this is?
This is an Ashram.

385
00:30:11,776 --> 00:30:13,801
Why are you looking there, son?
Look at me.

386
00:30:15,046 --> 00:30:16,741
l saw you madam,
you're beautiful.

387
00:30:16,948 --> 00:30:19,576
Didn't I tell you men are not
allowed into the Ashram?

388
00:30:19,784 --> 00:30:23,413
What's this gender difference?
We both have souls,

389
00:30:23,621 --> 00:30:25,248
Supreme Lord is up above.

390
00:30:25,456 --> 00:30:27,754
Don't confuse me with your silly logic.

391
00:30:28,193 --> 00:30:29,592
You've become very clever.

392
00:30:30,461 --> 00:30:32,429
Sorry madam, we'll finish the job
quickly & leave the place.

393
00:30:33,731 --> 00:30:43,697
I dream

394
00:30:46,444 --> 00:30:48,742
Swami, your Rs. 1000.

395
00:30:50,448 --> 00:30:51,415
Second episode.

396
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:56,084
This girl is good.

397
00:30:58,723 --> 00:31:00,588
What happened next day?
- Day?

398
00:31:00,959 --> 00:31:03,427
The day you were kidnapped
and slept that night.

399
00:31:04,963 --> 00:31:07,761
l slept and thought
I'll go home by morning.

400
00:31:08,132 --> 00:31:09,429
How could I expect a police raid?

401
00:31:16,474 --> 00:31:19,443
Get up
- They thought I was also a kidnapper.

402
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:20,776
They didn't listen to me.

403
00:31:21,312 --> 00:31:23,109
They arrested and took me
to the police station.

404
00:31:24,249 --> 00:31:26,114
How long you are into
this kidnapping business?

405
00:31:31,589 --> 00:31:34,786
What are you shouting at me?
Constable, take his finger prints.

406
00:31:37,428 --> 00:31:40,795
Why are you refusing to
give your finger print?

407
00:31:41,165 --> 00:31:42,962
Do you think yourself to be
Chiranjeevi in film 'Khaidi' ?

408
00:31:45,603 --> 00:31:47,298
I remembered Chiranjeevi once.

409
00:31:50,341 --> 00:31:52,036
I got 1000 elephants strength.

410
00:31:54,178 --> 00:31:55,475
Police station broke down.

411
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:26,506
Catch him!

412
00:32:27,378 --> 00:32:28,675
I ran into the forest.

413
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:32,412
Without knowing I became
a criminal on run.

414
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:37,682
What happened after that sir?

415
00:32:41,926 --> 00:32:45,953
Remove it... get up. That's all?
- Come, he'll not continue.

416
00:32:47,865 --> 00:32:51,392
She's coming.
- Greetings Shivani. Please sit down.

417
00:32:51,602 --> 00:32:54,400
Mother will scold if she knows
I'm meeting you.

418
00:32:54,605 --> 00:32:57,073
You can go,
please tell about your life.

419
00:32:57,942 --> 00:33:01,571
Though I was born in a factionist's family,
I wanted to live a fashionable life.

420
00:33:03,114 --> 00:33:06,413
I never expected I'll live
in a single costume.

421
00:33:06,617 --> 00:33:09,916
I must get up early morning,
practice Yoga,

422
00:33:10,121 --> 00:33:12,248
meditate and eat vegetarian food only.

423
00:33:12,457 --> 00:33:15,756
It's been aeons since
I eat something spicy.- Pickle!

424
00:33:19,297 --> 00:33:25,429
It's been long time... 
It's mouth-watering.- Me too.

425
00:33:25,636 --> 00:33:31,268
If you all don't mind
I'll have a lick.

426
00:33:36,981 --> 00:33:43,784
Mixing pickle with hot rice
and adding ghee to it,

427
00:33:44,255 --> 00:33:49,955
if you mix all and have it
... oh my God!

428
00:33:50,328 --> 00:33:54,788
We'll give you many such pickle bottles,
our Bala loves your Vaishali,

429
00:33:54,999 --> 00:33:56,227
you must help us.

430
00:33:57,335 --> 00:33:59,565
Do you know to speak Bengali?
- Do you know this?

431
00:33:59,937 --> 00:34:01,063
Vaishali is a Telugu girl.

432
00:34:02,273 --> 00:34:12,239
I dream

433
00:34:13,184 --> 00:34:15,584
Why did you lie to us that
Vaishali is a Bengali?

434
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:17,647
Do you know how much
I had lost for it?

435
00:34:17,855 --> 00:34:18,981
What have you lost?

436
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:22,819
You said Bengali, my position weakened
with lack of communication.

437
00:34:23,027 --> 00:34:26,326
How do you know my sorrow
of failing to express her my love?

438
00:34:26,597 --> 00:34:29,157
If she had been a Telugu girl,
I would've told her my feelings,

439
00:34:29,367 --> 00:34:31,665
by hook or crook,
I would've trapped her by now.

440
00:34:31,869 --> 00:34:33,496
I lied because you're like that.

441
00:34:35,306 --> 00:34:37,501
No need of shadow boxing any more.

442
00:34:37,708 --> 00:34:40,268
I'll express my heart, I like that girl,

443
00:34:40,545 --> 00:34:41,842
I love her,

444
00:34:42,046 --> 00:34:43,013
I don't know how you do it,

445
00:34:43,214 --> 00:34:45,842
if you all together convince
and give her to me,

446
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:47,517
I'll take her with me
and marry her.

447
00:34:47,718 --> 00:34:48,514
That's the matter.

448
00:34:53,658 --> 00:34:54,522
Please come with me.

449
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,524
Will she accept me?

450
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:06,366
Please sit here.

451
00:35:16,914 --> 00:35:18,381
Do you love me?

452
00:35:20,084 --> 00:35:24,043
Do you like me so much?
-Very much.

453
00:35:24,255 --> 00:35:30,057
Do you love my heart?
Or do you love my body?

454
00:35:30,261 --> 00:35:32,889
Your body! Because
I don't know your heart.

455
00:35:33,764 --> 00:35:37,564
Look, you're very beautiful,
enchanting smile,

456
00:35:37,768 --> 00:35:40,896
skin tone is fantastic,
that's enough for me.

457
00:35:42,607 --> 00:35:46,668
I don't know why you're so
attracted to this body.

458
00:35:47,512 --> 00:35:50,072
All this is mud.

459
00:35:50,448 --> 00:35:54,248
After our death this flesh
becomes a part of earth.

460
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:59,579
Blood and urine will mix with water.

461
00:36:00,625 --> 00:36:02,923
Breath will mix with air.

462
00:36:04,629 --> 00:36:07,257
Is this mud?

463
00:36:08,299 --> 00:36:11,166
Your mud is very good.

464
00:36:12,303 --> 00:36:15,932
You don't have any attraction
on this mud, right?- No.

465
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:17,937
No isn't it? Okay, good.

466
00:36:20,645 --> 00:36:23,614
Will you please do me a small favour?
- Go ahead.

467
00:36:25,149 --> 00:36:26,946
Small favour.
- Tell me.

468
00:36:27,151 --> 00:36:28,118
Spend a night with me.

469
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:36,883
Isn't it just mud?

470
00:36:39,931 --> 00:36:41,728
Don't tell about your silly philosophy.

471
00:36:41,933 --> 00:36:46,233
Mud... just mud... then why do you
take a bath everyday?

472
00:36:46,437 --> 00:36:53,809
Then soaps, Yoga, meditation,
vegetables, fruits, for this silly mud.

473
00:36:54,011 --> 00:36:56,241
He's talking nonsense,
let's go, mother.

474
00:36:58,616 --> 00:37:08,582
I dream

475
00:37:36,053 --> 00:37:40,012
You... you... you... 

476
00:37:40,725 --> 00:37:44,684
I love you with my heart... 

477
00:37:45,396 --> 00:37:54,202
Come... come... come... 

478
00:37:54,405 --> 00:37:58,364
Won't you listen to me?
What's your problem?

479
00:37:58,743 --> 00:38:00,870
My life and death is with you... 

480
00:38:01,078 --> 00:38:03,205
Can't you understand this?

481
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:35,502
I dream

482
00:38:58,769 --> 00:39:00,760
Beauty given by God... 

483
00:39:00,971 --> 00:39:03,098
Oh what a youth!

484
00:39:03,307 --> 00:39:05,275
Don't let it go waste... 

485
00:39:05,476 --> 00:39:07,535
If I touch it, it angers them... 

486
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:12,115
Without you I'm not there... 

487
00:39:12,316 --> 00:39:14,443
I can't leave you... 

488
00:39:14,652 --> 00:39:18,952
I'll drown myself in a dry well... 

489
00:39:19,156 --> 00:39:27,791
Listen to me... listen to me... 

490
00:39:43,948 --> 00:39:53,914
I dream

491
00:40:15,713 --> 00:40:18,511
What's this lousy philosophy... 

492
00:40:18,783 --> 00:40:20,842
Don't be too stubborn... 

493
00:40:21,218 --> 00:40:25,621
Even God is not spared by
this love and desire... 

494
00:40:27,792 --> 00:40:30,022
What's this your fate?

495
00:40:30,227 --> 00:40:32,195
Look at yourself... 

496
00:40:32,396 --> 00:40:36,856
Is there any greater sin that this?

497
00:41:32,456 --> 00:41:35,755
What's all this nonsense you're blurting?

498
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:38,690
You cried... I've made you cry, right?

499
00:41:39,129 --> 00:41:43,088
I'm very happy,
first success in my love.

500
00:41:43,634 --> 00:41:46,159
This is enough for today,
go home and offer prayers.

501
00:41:46,403 --> 00:41:50,772
Let's meet tomorrow. Go... go.

502
00:42:02,052 --> 00:42:04,612
Thanks Goddess.

503
00:42:06,223 --> 00:42:06,951
Don't worry brother.

504
00:42:07,424 --> 00:42:17,390
I dream

505
00:42:21,105 --> 00:42:31,140
My dear son. Look at me.
It's me! Your mother!

506
00:42:34,184 --> 00:42:36,652
Don't mistake me,
I'm learning Tamil.

507
00:42:41,859 --> 00:42:49,425
It's me... your mother! My dear!

508
00:42:54,038 --> 00:42:56,506
Location is great. Film it well.

509
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:30,470
What? Hooliganism?

510
00:43:30,741 --> 00:43:32,470
Will you take it free?

511
00:43:32,843 --> 00:43:37,041
We are begging.
- But it doesn't appear like that.

512
00:43:37,247 --> 00:43:41,707
It's like we are here, so give us.
It's like plundering them.

513
00:43:43,253 --> 00:43:44,880
English too for begging.

514
00:43:45,856 --> 00:43:48,222
Hey girl! Want apples?
-Yes.

515
00:43:50,928 --> 00:43:55,388
Why are you showing off man?
Teasing girls?

516
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:58,727
You're also teasing me.

517
00:43:58,936 --> 00:44:02,064
You mean me and that fool are same?

518
00:44:03,874 --> 00:44:06,069
I'm hero and he's a villain.

519
00:44:07,277 --> 00:44:08,403
Am I a villain?

520
00:44:08,779 --> 00:44:11,179
I was thinking all these
days I was a hero.

521
00:44:11,548 --> 00:44:12,913
She punctured my ego.

522
00:44:17,855 --> 00:44:19,914
Come, I'll get you an apple garden.

523
00:44:21,125 --> 00:44:23,252
You can get bigger apples there.

524
00:44:24,294 --> 00:44:28,594
Bloody! Why are you teasing her?
-Will you beat me?

525
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:31,768
I'll burst your face.
- How dare you raise hand on me?

526
00:44:31,969 --> 00:44:33,937
You'll pay for this.
-You go.

527
00:44:34,138 --> 00:44:35,264
Bloody street dog!

528
00:44:37,374 --> 00:44:39,274
Stop staring... go man.

529
00:44:41,478 --> 00:44:42,604
Why are you beating him?

530
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:43,869
He did a wrong thing.

531
00:44:44,982 --> 00:44:48,679
There's God to punish the sinners.
Who are you to beat him?

532
00:44:49,319 --> 00:44:53,119
Do you know? I'm God!

533
00:44:53,657 --> 00:44:57,286
Keep watching,
I'll have a ball with them.- No

534
00:44:58,228 --> 00:45:00,696
Why are you staring at me?
I'm coming.

535
00:45:04,334 --> 00:45:06,632
Why are you bowing to me?
Got scared?

536
00:45:07,071 --> 00:45:08,299
Please come.
- Come?

537
00:45:08,505 --> 00:45:10,632
Come.
- Go.

538
00:45:11,775 --> 00:45:15,802
I like you guys. Your welcome is nice.
- Come.

539
00:45:16,013 --> 00:45:18,811
This place is good.
What's this? Any feast?

540
00:45:22,586 --> 00:45:27,489
Bloody crooks! Have you planned
to kill me here?

541
00:45:35,632 --> 00:45:38,499
Kung-Fu? I don't know.

542
00:45:38,769 --> 00:45:42,000
We'll fight in different styles
and it'll create confusion,

543
00:45:42,206 --> 00:45:43,173
it's your will and wish.

544
00:45:44,374 --> 00:45:48,174
Didn't get me?
Fighting will create confusion.

545
00:45:48,712 --> 00:45:49,508
Got me?

546
00:45:58,555 --> 00:45:59,180
How is it?

547
00:45:59,389 --> 00:46:02,517
You know a place known as Guntur,

548
00:46:03,127 --> 00:46:06,858
if I beat you hear,
it will echo in Guntur.

549
00:46:08,398 --> 00:46:09,194
Got me?

550
00:46:55,879 --> 00:46:57,574
Why are you stamping
my leg, bloody fool?

551
00:47:18,468 --> 00:47:19,935
Don't turn, let's go please.

552
00:47:29,813 --> 00:47:31,280
Come now, I'll teach you a lesson.

553
00:47:32,649 --> 00:47:33,616
Come on.

554
00:48:33,210 --> 00:48:36,338
That's a great shot.
- Bloody fools! Couldn't you help me?

555
00:48:36,546 --> 00:48:38,241
l though but I don't know Kung-Fu.

556
00:48:38,715 --> 00:48:41,684
Keep this, was there such a big fight?

557
00:48:41,952 --> 00:48:44,921
How nice it would've been
if I had been there?

558
00:48:46,490 --> 00:48:48,515
It's been long time
I had seen a movie,

559
00:48:48,725 --> 00:48:50,693
at least I would've seen a fight.

560
00:48:51,228 --> 00:49:00,193
He fought those fighters for you,
that shows how much he likes you.

561
00:49:00,404 --> 00:49:05,808
He's handsome, he's razor sharp,
more over a Telugu,

562
00:49:06,043 --> 00:49:07,704
I like this proposal very much.

563
00:49:08,245 --> 00:49:10,713
Proposal?
Are you fixing a proposal for me?

564
00:49:10,914 --> 00:49:15,374
That's what I'm also confused.
What did I say now?

565
00:49:45,282 --> 00:49:47,250
I was caught by Naxalites in forest.

566
00:49:47,551 --> 00:49:49,246
How long you're in covert operations?

567
00:49:49,453 --> 00:49:50,750
Covert operations? What is it?

568
00:49:50,954 --> 00:49:52,751
How long you're working for police?

569
00:49:52,956 --> 00:49:54,981
Police? I hate police.

570
00:49:55,459 --> 00:49:58,860
l beat policemen, I support Naxalites,

571
00:49:59,129 --> 00:50:03,429
this village is ours, this land is ours,

572
00:50:03,633 --> 00:50:06,261
tree is ours, mountain is ours... 

573
00:50:12,142 --> 00:50:13,109
They beat me black and blue.

574
00:50:13,910 --> 00:50:17,778
I didn't know how to escape
from them & meet my wife.

575
00:50:18,315 --> 00:50:20,943
Will continue next week.
Rs. 1000.

576
00:50:23,186 --> 00:50:25,950
You mustn't say it.
-You play.

577
00:50:26,490 --> 00:50:27,457
Those sanyasins are going that side.

578
00:50:27,657 --> 00:50:35,723
Call them... quickly.
- Sanyasins... stop... greetings... 

579
00:50:35,932 --> 00:50:42,633
Please welcome to our tents.
- Greetings Prabha... Shivani... 

580
00:50:47,778 --> 00:50:49,803
Where is Vaishali?
- In the cave.

581
00:50:50,013 --> 00:50:52,811
We are doing a program
on sanyasins for TV... - Good.

582
00:50:53,016 --> 00:50:55,484
It will be good.- How long are you
planning to stay here?

583
00:50:55,685 --> 00:50:57,983
We must do a good program
for MAA TV, interview mother.

584
00:50:58,188 --> 00:51:01,646
Mothers in Manali, this is the title.
-Why boys?

585
00:51:01,858 --> 00:51:04,986
What is the difference between
soul and supreme soul?

586
00:51:05,195 --> 00:51:06,685
No need of that topic now son.

587
00:51:07,564 --> 00:51:14,436
If I'm not wrong Bala Govind will be
running towards cave by now.

588
00:51:17,507 --> 00:51:18,531
Yes, you're right.

589
00:51:18,875 --> 00:51:19,603
How did you find it?

590
00:51:20,944 --> 00:51:23,879
I started this Ashram after
great upheavals in life,

591
00:51:25,115 --> 00:51:27,811
Man with passionate desires will not
have fear, shame or any feeling.

592
00:51:28,985 --> 00:51:29,883
She's saying about love.

593
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:38,052
Man with passionate desires will not
have fear, shame or any feeling.

594
00:51:39,996 --> 00:51:42,157
Don't say like that madam, say love.

595
00:51:42,365 --> 00:51:43,297
Our boy has fallen in love.

596
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:45,900
Is she a college girl to fall in love with?

597
00:51:46,470 --> 00:51:46,993
She's a sanyasin.

598
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:53,434
Your friend will not harm her, right?

599
00:51:54,511 --> 00:51:56,911
He's tough only outside.

600
00:52:03,186 --> 00:52:13,152
I dream

601
00:52:28,378 --> 00:52:28,969
Why are you going away?

602
00:52:30,213 --> 00:52:30,679
Stop.

603
00:52:54,070 --> 00:52:57,528
Look, as I neared you, it has created
a chemical reaction in you,

604
00:52:58,441 --> 00:52:59,533
you're sweating profusely.

605
00:53:01,011 --> 00:53:03,707
Not only you, I'm also sweating.

606
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:09,649
Look, I don't think this
is the right path.

607
00:53:10,854 --> 00:53:13,652
Even if this is right path,
you're not the right choice for it.

608
00:53:15,926 --> 00:53:16,790
I want to talk to you.

609
00:53:18,195 --> 00:53:18,820
If you come I'll finish it.

610
00:53:19,563 --> 00:53:20,029
Sit here.

611
00:53:21,998 --> 00:53:22,794
No problem. Please sit down.

612
00:53:26,937 --> 00:53:30,395
Look... how beautiful you are!

613
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:31,837
Perfect figure!

614
00:53:32,442 --> 00:53:33,568
What's wrong with you?

615
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:37,039
Are you getting angry on me?

616
00:53:37,447 --> 00:53:38,243
Even if you get angry I don't care,

617
00:53:38,949 --> 00:53:41,474
I love you sincerely,

618
00:53:42,152 --> 00:53:43,312
I wish to marry you,

619
00:53:43,820 --> 00:53:46,015
you needn't have any doubt
about my financial status,

620
00:53:46,656 --> 00:53:48,920
I'm a Program Director
with MAA TV,

621
00:53:49,793 --> 00:53:51,021
my salary is Rs. 40000,

622
00:53:52,229 --> 00:53:54,220

too works there only,

623
00:53:54,798 --> 00:53:56,026
his salary is Rs. 60000,

624
00:53:56,466 --> 00:53:58,229
even if I blow up my entire salary,

625
00:53:58,702 --> 00:54:00,670
my father's entire salary
will be yours. Okay?

626
00:54:01,171 --> 00:54:03,731
We have a big own house.

627
00:54:04,641 --> 00:54:05,471
We have two vehicles.

628
00:54:08,211 --> 00:54:09,109
We don't have any problems.

629
00:54:09,412 --> 00:54:12,108
We don't beg fruits and
vegetables like you.

630
00:54:12,616 --> 00:54:13,275
We buy them.

631
00:54:13,683 --> 00:54:14,274
Got me?

632
00:54:14,718 --> 00:54:15,412
This is my visiting card.

633
00:54:16,019 --> 00:54:18,419
Whenever you have the feeling,
call me immediately,

634
00:54:18,688 --> 00:54:19,347
I'll take you with me.

635
00:54:20,390 --> 00:54:21,220
Okay, bye.

636
00:54:21,658 --> 00:54:29,087
Look, people must die in jealousy over
a bad guy like me getting you,

637
00:54:29,366 --> 00:54:32,062
that's my target. Okay?
Think and decide.

638
00:54:37,774 --> 00:54:38,468
Do you know Bala Govind?

639
00:54:38,975 --> 00:54:39,441
l know him sir.

640
00:54:41,111 --> 00:54:42,009
Is he your friend?
-Yes sir.

641
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:44,606
Do you've his number?
- I do sir.

642
00:54:44,881 --> 00:54:46,075
Is it in this?
-Yes sir.

643
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:50,051
Is it Bala Govind's number?

644
00:54:51,421 --> 00:54:51,887
Yes sir.

645
00:54:52,088 --> 00:54:53,680
Do you've a cell phone? Take it out.

646
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:59,186
Make a call to this number.

647
00:55:04,067 --> 00:55:05,466
Switch on the speaker.

648
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:12,005
How are you Chandramohan?

649
00:55:12,342 --> 00:55:13,604
When are you returning my Rs. 25000?

650
00:55:14,110 --> 00:55:14,940
He owes me money.

651
00:55:15,545 --> 00:55:17,308
Rs. 25000?

652
00:55:17,814 --> 00:55:18,678
Rs. 25000?

653
00:55:18,948 --> 00:55:20,745
Have you forgotten it?
Can't you remember it?

654
00:55:25,555 --> 00:55:27,250
I'll not pay, what will you do?

655
00:55:27,924 --> 00:55:28,686
What will I do?

656
00:55:29,025 --> 00:55:31,084
I'll talk to boss and get it
deducted from your salary.

657
00:55:31,628 --> 00:55:36,361
If you insist, I've resigned
from MAA TV, go to hell.

658
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:37,360
Don't waste my time.

659
00:55:38,001 --> 00:55:39,059
Do you want me to ask
where is he now?

660
00:55:40,403 --> 00:55:41,301
Where are you now?

661
00:55:41,705 --> 00:55:44,401
I don't need to answer you.
Cut the call.

662
00:55:45,942 --> 00:55:47,807
Hey Bala Govind.

663
00:55:48,011 --> 00:55:48,875
Who are you?

664
00:55:49,245 --> 00:55:51,145
I'm your father's friend,

665
00:55:51,915 --> 00:55:54,281
I want to go to your home,
tell me your address.

666
00:55:54,484 --> 00:55:55,280
Take down.

667
00:55:55,585 --> 00:55:56,244
Tell me.

668
00:55:56,920 --> 00:56:06,886
I dream

669
00:56:08,398 --> 00:56:10,696
My father will be waiting, go to him.

670
00:56:12,235 --> 00:56:14,726
Who wants addresses in
America and Australia?

671
00:56:15,105 --> 00:56:17,232
I want that dog's address.

672
00:56:17,574 --> 00:56:20,042
Get his address from
the phone company.

673
00:56:20,510 --> 00:56:23,001
Bloody, come... come on boys.

674
00:56:27,617 --> 00:56:29,107
Where is going so late night?

675
00:56:29,352 --> 00:56:34,585
Man with passionate desires will not
have fear, shame or any feeling.

676
00:56:34,791 --> 00:56:36,053
Stop it... 
-Why did you ask me then?

677
00:56:55,779 --> 00:56:59,215
You bought a silk sari for your
elder and younger sister,

678
00:56:59,582 --> 00:57:01,607
you bought a silk sari for
your sister-in-law too.

679
00:57:01,885 --> 00:57:04,410
You bought a silk sari for
your old mother too.

680
00:57:04,854 --> 00:57:06,412
Am I a stranger to you?

681
00:57:06,723 --> 00:57:09,021
Why should I be your wife then?

682
00:57:23,273 --> 00:57:24,934
Why did you come and
why are you leaving?

683
00:57:29,813 --> 00:57:31,713
I'll tell you truth,

684
00:57:32,182 --> 00:57:33,376
I'm not able to sleep,

685
00:57:33,917 --> 00:57:35,350
I think of only Vaishali always,

686
00:57:36,052 --> 00:57:39,488
l came to check if she was also
in the same condition,

687
00:57:40,490 --> 00:57:45,189
but late night, it's Ashram, many are
discussing personal matters,

688
00:57:46,229 --> 00:57:48,891
I felt it's wrong and was leaving.

689
00:57:50,266 --> 00:57:52,427
You make me remember my son.

690
00:57:53,136 --> 00:57:54,103
Your age is like that.

691
00:57:54,471 --> 00:57:56,564
A few more days and
you'll forget that girl.

692
00:57:57,207 --> 00:57:59,004
Take my advice and go to sleep.

693
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:15,253
Bloody rascal!
You spoiled her peace.

694
00:58:21,331 --> 00:58:22,923
What's this son?

695
00:58:23,867 --> 00:58:24,765
Please listen to me.

696
00:58:26,569 --> 00:58:27,228
Eat this apple.

697
00:58:28,771 --> 00:58:29,738
Aren't you hungry?

698
00:58:30,173 --> 00:58:32,767
l do feel very hungry.

699
00:58:34,177 --> 00:58:35,405
I want Bala Govind.

700
00:58:36,913 --> 00:58:37,572
Ask your husband.

701
00:58:38,681 --> 00:58:39,807
What is he doing?

702
00:58:40,984 --> 00:58:42,144
Aren't you and your husband ashamed?

703
00:58:44,220 --> 00:58:46,188
Where is he?

704
00:58:46,856 --> 00:58:48,653
Call him on phone.
- Call him.

705
00:58:49,058 --> 00:58:50,286
Where is he? Give it to me.

706
00:58:50,894 --> 00:58:52,828
Where are you dog? Tell me.

707
00:58:53,196 --> 00:58:54,959
Who is it talking so smoothly?

708
00:58:55,431 --> 00:58:58,525
I'm Andalu, Murugesan's mother.

709
00:58:59,102 --> 00:59:01,263
Then you must also be in coma.

710
00:59:02,405 --> 00:59:04,100
Will you beat me also?

711
00:59:05,842 --> 00:59:07,173
What did you say to my mother?

712
00:59:07,610 --> 00:59:11,011
This time I'm planning to beat your
mother also along with you.

713
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:14,748
What? Tell me where you are!

714
00:59:15,018 --> 00:59:15,484
Give the phone to me.

715
00:59:15,785 --> 00:59:18,310
Hey bloody idiot!
Where are you bloody dog?

716
00:59:18,588 --> 00:59:20,249
Come on tell me.

717
00:59:20,623 --> 00:59:21,715
Who are you Swami?

718
00:59:22,025 --> 00:59:23,686
I'm Ponnuswamy.

719
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:27,291
l beat, you got beaten up,

720
00:59:27,931 --> 00:59:30,923
get well soon and go home safely,

721
00:59:31,467 --> 00:59:32,764
don't try to act smart.

722
00:59:36,272 --> 00:59:38,137
Tell me your address.

723
00:59:38,508 --> 00:59:41,238
My foot address, hang the phone.

724
00:59:41,811 --> 00:59:42,436
Cut the line.

725
00:59:43,346 --> 00:59:44,142
The girl is coming.

726
00:59:45,915 --> 00:59:47,746
Come my beauty!

727
00:59:49,152 --> 00:59:50,119
Uncle.
- Nephew.

728
00:59:51,087 --> 00:59:52,452
How does the girl look like to you?

729
00:59:54,657 --> 00:59:59,924
She's like rare divine bead,
washed in holy Ganges and milk,

730
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:03,289
she's pure and divine like after
another holy dip in river Ganges.

731
01:00:04,634 --> 01:00:06,534
Do you know how she appears to me?

732
01:00:11,441 --> 01:00:12,169
She's like that!

733
01:00:13,042 --> 01:00:13,667
You'll lose sight.

734
01:00:13,910 --> 01:00:17,471
In fact my eyes are brightening
after seeing her.

735
01:00:17,714 --> 01:00:21,309
Look at her with my eyes, uncle.

736
01:00:22,185 --> 01:00:32,151
I dream

737
01:01:05,294 --> 01:01:06,488
Created trouble... 

738
01:01:07,397 --> 01:01:08,830
Lit fire... 

739
01:01:09,932 --> 01:01:11,399
Besieged me... 

740
01:01:12,602 --> 01:01:14,126
She created trouble..

741
01:01:15,204 --> 01:01:16,637
She lit fire..

742
01:01:17,607 --> 01:01:19,871
She created upheaval in me... 

743
01:01:20,143 --> 01:01:23,635
She entered my heart
and lit fire of love... 

744
01:01:25,048 --> 01:01:27,278
Cat-eyed beauty... 

745
01:01:27,517 --> 01:01:29,678
She stole me lock, stock and barrel... 

746
01:01:29,886 --> 01:01:32,081
I'm on cloud nine... 

747
01:01:32,288 --> 01:01:35,086
She has aroused passion in me... 

748
01:01:37,026 --> 01:01:39,426
Don't be so sure... 

749
01:01:39,629 --> 01:01:41,597
I'll not fall so easily... 

750
01:01:42,198 --> 01:01:44,098
The love race has begun... 

751
01:01:44,333 --> 01:01:46,699
If you win it's a golden chance... 

752
01:02:03,953 --> 01:02:13,919
I dream

753
01:02:38,354 --> 01:02:40,549
You don't ogle at me like that... 

754
01:02:40,757 --> 01:02:42,952
Don't kill me... 

755
01:02:43,159 --> 01:02:45,559
My mind will get blocked... 

756
01:02:45,762 --> 01:02:48,230
I'll cross the line... 

757
01:02:48,498 --> 01:02:50,227
If you give me a kiss... 

758
01:02:50,433 --> 01:02:52,901
I'll be in heaven... 

759
01:02:53,102 --> 01:02:55,332
If you give me a hug... 

760
01:02:55,538 --> 01:02:57,733
I'll lose myself... 

761
01:02:58,107 --> 01:03:00,473
How can I offer my sweet cheeks?

762
01:03:00,676 --> 01:03:02,735
What magic can bring me closer to you?

763
01:03:08,017 --> 01:03:12,181
I've gone mad... 

764
01:03:12,421 --> 01:03:14,719
She hit the bulls eye... 

765
01:03:25,034 --> 01:03:35,000
I dream

766
01:03:54,197 --> 01:03:56,461
Don't come after me... 

767
01:03:56,732 --> 01:03:58,927
Don't express your heart... 

768
01:03:59,135 --> 01:04:01,365
My heart will respond positively... 

769
01:04:01,604 --> 01:04:04,095
It will become yours... 

770
01:04:04,407 --> 01:04:06,341
If you give green signal... 

771
01:04:06,909 --> 01:04:08,740
My life will become a festival... 

772
01:04:09,312 --> 01:04:11,371
If you give yourself to me... 

773
01:04:11,714 --> 01:04:13,739
My life will be blessed... 

774
01:04:14,250 --> 01:04:16,184
I'll not serve you lunch now... 

775
01:04:16,719 --> 01:04:18,687
I'll never serve you dinner... 

776
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:45,811
What other Red songs do you know?

777
01:04:46,682 --> 01:04:47,205
Sing... 

778
01:04:48,351 --> 01:04:52,219
I'll become a mole on
your feet, my sister... 

779
01:04:52,622 --> 01:04:56,114
I'll repay the gratitude
of a brother, my sister... 

780
01:04:56,626 --> 01:04:58,526
You're not arousing suspicion at all,

781
01:04:58,995 --> 01:05:00,394
they have trained you very well.

782
01:05:01,764 --> 01:05:02,890
Are you bothered about
your problems only?

783
01:05:03,366 --> 01:05:04,390
Won't you think about my problem?

784
01:05:04,700 --> 01:05:06,463
Very urgent.
- Sit.

785
01:05:07,236 --> 01:05:08,726
Very... very urgent.
- Sit here!

786
01:05:14,176 --> 01:05:14,972
Stop... stop... 

787
01:05:25,688 --> 01:05:26,177
Who are you?

788
01:05:27,356 --> 01:05:28,983
I'm Shankar. Urgent... 

789
01:05:30,092 --> 01:05:30,649
What is in it?

790
01:05:31,394 --> 01:05:31,985
Water.

791
01:05:32,194 --> 01:05:33,786
Check it.
- Check it.

792
01:05:37,433 --> 01:05:39,162
Sergeant, it's liquid RDX.

793
01:05:40,569 --> 01:05:41,467
Liquid RDX?

794
01:05:42,238 --> 01:05:43,705
What are you planning to blow up?

795
01:05:44,473 --> 01:05:46,168
RDX? I'm not what you... 

796
01:05:48,144 --> 01:05:48,974
What happened after that sir?

797
01:05:49,645 --> 01:05:50,202
This is life.

798
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:51,544
I can't finish it in a day.

799
01:05:52,281 --> 01:05:54,112
Finish it quickly, we are leaving
day after tomorrow.

800
01:05:55,518 --> 01:05:56,314
I'm also coming to Hyderabad.

801
01:05:56,886 --> 01:05:59,821
Give me your visiting card
along with Rs. 1000.

802
01:06:04,293 --> 01:06:14,259
I dream

803
01:06:36,692 --> 01:06:38,387
Are you angry?

804
01:06:39,128 --> 01:06:40,789
Without doing anything.

805
01:06:41,597 --> 01:06:42,586
If you come closer to me... 

806
01:06:43,866 --> 01:06:45,595
Look, you are also getting angry.

807
01:06:46,702 --> 01:06:47,794
You feel like beating me, right?

808
01:06:48,838 --> 01:06:49,827
You feel like killing me, right?

809
01:06:52,575 --> 01:06:54,770
These are not characteristics
of Sanyasins.

810
01:06:55,711 --> 01:06:56,803
You're not a sanyasin.

811
01:06:57,947 --> 01:06:59,380
There are many other feelings in you.

812
01:06:59,682 --> 01:07:00,512
But you hide it.

813
01:07:01,083 --> 01:07:02,744
You cried the other day near the temple.

814
01:07:03,085 --> 01:07:04,484
Today you're threatening to kill me.

815
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:06,688
You've love too,
but you'll not accept it.

816
01:07:07,123 --> 01:07:08,818
Stubborn girl, why don't you accept it?

817
01:07:11,093 --> 01:07:11,650
What happened?

818
01:07:12,895 --> 01:07:14,829
You tried to kill me now, right?
I got hurt.

819
01:07:18,467 --> 01:07:19,798
Sorry is also a feeling,

820
01:07:20,069 --> 01:07:22,537
tie if you love me, or else don't.
- I don't love you.

821
01:07:23,305 --> 01:07:24,465
tie if you love me, or else don't.

822
01:07:25,341 --> 01:07:25,864
No, you love me.

823
01:07:28,077 --> 01:07:28,634
I'll not agree even if you slap me.

824
01:07:30,246 --> 01:07:31,770
What a slap! Bloody devil!

825
01:07:32,114 --> 01:07:33,240
You slapped me, tie the bandage.

826
01:07:36,685 --> 01:07:37,310
Why are you crying?

827
01:07:39,121 --> 01:07:43,023
This is just mud... 
this blood will mix with water... 

828
01:07:43,292 --> 01:07:44,418
It was your tale, right?

829
01:07:48,330 --> 01:07:50,161
What you know is I love you.

830
01:07:51,100 --> 01:07:53,091
What you don't know
is you too love me.

831
01:07:53,669 --> 01:07:54,431
We are leaving this place tomorrow,

832
01:07:55,504 --> 01:07:57,597
I'll wait for you till 10 am
in Solong Valley,

833
01:07:58,140 --> 01:07:59,334
I'll take you with me if you come,

834
01:08:00,176 --> 01:08:02,235
I'll not ask you again, think over it.

835
01:08:04,613 --> 01:08:06,410
I'm not as useless as you think.

836
01:08:07,283 --> 01:08:08,614
I too have few good characters.

837
01:08:17,526 --> 01:08:21,121
You all are leaving, I'll not get any
film information hereafter,

838
01:08:21,330 --> 01:08:24,128
Isn't Raghavendra Rao
making any films?

839
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:25,995
Recently he gave a big hit film
'Ramadass' with Nagarjuna.

840
01:08:26,168 --> 01:08:29,763
Has he made 'Ramadass' also with
Nagarjuna after 'Annamayya'?

841
01:08:32,274 --> 01:08:33,707
Any other old news?

842
01:08:33,909 --> 01:08:35,706
Laya is getting married
and leaving to US.

843
01:08:36,345 --> 01:08:37,676
Daughter of Chiranjeevi got married.

844
01:08:38,114 --> 01:08:39,206
Ravi Teja is blessed with a son.

845
01:08:40,649 --> 01:08:41,581
Mahesh Babu too is
blessed with a son.

846
01:08:41,984 --> 01:08:44,214
Is Mahesh Babu married?

847
01:08:45,321 --> 01:08:47,186
So you've been here for long time?

848
01:08:47,556 --> 01:08:48,022
Bye.

849
01:08:48,824 --> 01:08:50,314
Bye Prabha.

850
01:08:50,793 --> 01:08:52,818
You're saying bye to everyone,
won't you say bye to Vaishali?

851
01:08:54,497 --> 01:08:55,327
No.
-Why?

852
01:08:55,931 --> 01:08:57,592
Because she's coming
with me tomorrow.

853
01:08:57,800 --> 01:08:58,892
Are you so confident?

854
01:09:00,035 --> 01:09:00,763
You keep watching.

855
01:09:01,537 --> 01:09:02,970
Bye.
- Bye.

856
01:09:20,122 --> 01:09:24,252
CD's? We'll send it.
- Come, let's go quickly.

857
01:09:35,971 --> 01:09:38,439
Pack quickly,
we'll reach Delhi late night.

858
01:09:38,641 --> 01:09:39,938
We have to catch a train there.

859
01:09:40,709 --> 01:09:44,042
Why are you dull?
-We are sad for Bala.

860
01:10:23,285 --> 01:10:29,155
I'm leaving... I'll never come back... 

861
01:10:30,793 --> 01:10:37,494
Will you come or not?
Are you Miss Universe?

862
01:10:37,967 --> 01:10:45,169
You've gone mad eating raw food.
I'm going away.

863
01:10:46,609 --> 01:10:47,769
Get lost!

864
01:10:52,381 --> 01:10:54,679
Come, let's go.
- Let's wait for sometime.

865

No use, she'll not come.
l know it.

866
01:10:57,386 --> 01:10:58,353
No Bala, she may come.

867
01:10:58,554 --> 01:11:00,181
Any other girl will come but not her.

868
01:11:00,389 --> 01:11:03,017
l know, useless to waste
time for her, get in.

869
01:11:03,225 --> 01:11:04,192
Won't I find any other girl?

870
01:11:04,393 --> 01:11:05,860
No need to board back side,
get in front,

871
01:11:06,061 --> 01:11:09,258
When she hasn't come any
place is same, let's go.

872
01:11:09,431 --> 01:11:11,695

Get in quickly. Come, let's go.

874
01:12:09,358 --> 01:12:12,759
Sir... please don't kill me.

875
01:12:14,963 --> 01:12:17,431
Tell Bala Govind not to
come to Hyderabad.

876
01:12:17,700 --> 01:12:21,261
Thambidurai's men are beating up
Govind mistaking him for Bala.

877
01:12:21,970 --> 01:12:23,096
Brother, stop the vehicle.

878
01:12:23,305 --> 01:12:25,773
What happened?
- Call from our office.

879
01:12:25,974 --> 01:12:27,737
They don't want Bala to come
to Hyderabad. - Where is he?

880
01:12:27,910 --> 01:12:29,605
He fell off the van. Search him.

881
01:12:34,083 --> 01:12:35,607
I've changed my mind, you proceed.

882
01:12:35,818 --> 01:12:37,285
I'll not come without Vaishali.

883
01:12:37,486 --> 01:12:39,113
I'm not Bala Govind,
please don't kill me.

884
01:12:59,341 --> 01:13:00,308
What are you doing here?

885
01:13:00,676 --> 01:13:02,974
Ever since I saw you, I'm sleepless.

886
01:13:03,178 --> 01:13:05,646
Come... come with me.

887
01:13:43,218 --> 01:13:43,843
Where is she?

888
01:14:35,103 --> 01:14:36,570
Did they stop you from reaching me?

889
01:14:52,554 --> 01:14:53,077
Who is he?

890
01:14:59,394 --> 01:15:00,486
Where is Bala Govind then?

891
01:15:01,630 --> 01:15:02,255
Where?

892
01:15:03,232 --> 01:15:09,262
Stop... Vaishali.

893
01:15:18,814 --> 01:15:21,942
Were you late to come?

894
01:15:22,150 --> 01:15:25,119
Were you late to come?

895
01:15:25,320 --> 01:15:27,447
You came for me, right?

896
01:15:27,656 --> 01:15:30,124
Didn't you come for me?

897
01:15:30,325 --> 01:15:32,793
Didn't you come for me?

898
01:15:32,995 --> 01:15:33,962
Why did you come then?

899
01:15:35,397 --> 01:15:36,455
Ain't I talking to her?

900
01:15:41,169 --> 01:15:43,296
Why did you come then if not for me?

901
01:15:44,773 --> 01:15:45,797
For me only... 

902
01:15:47,209 --> 01:15:48,471
l know you came for me only.

903
01:15:49,511 --> 01:15:52,139
l know you love me.

904
01:15:53,415 --> 01:15:57,647
I don't love you.

905
01:16:16,972 --> 01:16:18,166
Don't lie.

906
01:16:20,309 --> 01:16:21,173
Tell me the truth.

907
01:16:22,377 --> 01:16:24,004
Do you love or not?

908
01:16:25,314 --> 01:16:29,512
I don't love you.
I didn't come here for you.

909
01:16:29,718 --> 01:16:37,124
Please go away. I don't love you.

910
01:16:37,326 --> 01:16:43,026
Why don't you love me?

911
01:16:43,332 --> 01:16:46,927
You must have a reason, right? Tell me.

912
01:16:49,838 --> 01:16:51,703
How dare you touch Vaishali!

913
01:17:07,089 --> 01:17:09,887
Call... make a call to Bala Govind.

914
01:17:24,940 --> 01:17:27,738
I can't get through.
- Try again, Ponnuswamy.

915
01:17:35,217 --> 01:17:36,912
Stop... 

916
01:17:43,759 --> 01:17:50,096
Vaishali... .stop.

917
01:18:05,180 --> 01:18:06,613
Come on answer my call!

918
01:18:09,162 --> 01:18:10,959
Answer my phone call.

919
01:18:12,498 --> 01:18:14,625
What's your problem man?

920
01:18:15,334 --> 01:18:16,130
Where are you?

921
01:18:16,335 --> 01:18:17,802
Tell me the matter.

922
01:18:18,004 --> 01:18:20,802
When are you coming back
to Hyderabad?-Why?

923
01:18:21,007 --> 01:18:22,304
I want to thrash you.

924
01:18:22,508 --> 01:18:25,966
Just now I thrashed few goons,
I'll come back definitely.

925
01:18:26,179 --> 01:18:30,582
Let's meet as soon as I come,
my cell is running out of money,

926
01:18:30,783 --> 01:18:35,652
if you want to talk to me,
get my cell phone re-charged.

927
01:18:36,689 --> 01:18:38,657
Let's have a ball!

928
01:18:47,366 --> 01:18:49,994
Charge the camera battery.
- Charge your brain too.

929
01:18:50,369 --> 01:18:52,337
Why did you come without intimation?
Where is my son?

930
01:18:52,538 --> 01:18:53,004
He didn't come sir.

931
01:18:53,206 --> 01:18:56,437
Thank God, situation here isn't
good for him, where is he now?

932
01:18:56,642 --> 01:18:59,509
No need to hide it from you,
your son fell in love.-Yes sir.

933
01:18:59,712 --> 01:19:00,838
Love? Who is the girl?

934
01:19:01,047 --> 01:19:04,414
She's not a girl, a sanyasin.
- Sanyasin?

935
01:19:05,051 --> 01:19:06,348
What a life is this?

936
01:19:06,552 --> 01:19:12,354
I wish to devour exotic
delicacies of Andhra.

937
01:19:12,725 --> 01:19:13,851
What are you looking at?

938
01:19:14,393 --> 01:19:16,190
I'm asking you.

939
01:19:24,737 --> 01:19:26,364
Do you know how beautiful you are?

940
01:19:26,572 --> 01:19:29,302
Small eyes... Little lips... 

941
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:37,040
If you start looking your
face in the mirror,

942
01:19:37,583 --> 01:19:39,881
you'll feel like applying lipstick,

943
01:19:40,119 --> 01:19:42,053
feel like applying kohl to eyes,

944
01:19:42,421 --> 01:19:43,888
you feel like sporting a dot,

945
01:19:44,090 --> 01:19:46,217
mirror leads to all sorts of problems.

946
01:19:46,425 --> 01:19:48,120
That's why mirror is
banned in Ashram.

947
01:19:50,429 --> 01:19:51,896
Load it quickly.

948
01:19:52,098 --> 01:19:54,896
Why there are lot of apples here?
-Always ask for money.

949
01:19:56,435 --> 01:19:58,460
Do it quickly.
-Are you apple seller?

950
01:19:59,372 --> 01:20:00,737
What's the price of a box of apples?

951
01:20:01,774 --> 01:20:04,072
How much stock you need?

952
01:20:04,443 --> 01:20:07,241
3 loads? Tell me how much you need?
- I'm asking you man.

953
01:20:07,780 --> 01:20:10,408
What's that red cap? Bloody fool!

954
01:20:10,716 --> 01:20:12,411
Only shouts, no business.

955
01:20:12,685 --> 01:20:15,347
He's over acting.

956
01:20:15,788 --> 01:20:17,415
Bloody... idiot.

957
01:20:17,623 --> 01:20:20,922
He's acting as if he's great.
-Why do you hurt others with your talk?

958
01:20:21,194 --> 01:20:23,094
You talk too much of nonsense.

959
01:20:26,699 --> 01:20:28,690
Don't talk to anyone for a day.

960
01:20:30,136 --> 01:20:31,933
Just a kind of meditation.

961
01:20:33,306 --> 01:20:34,933
Your nonsense will reduce.

962
01:20:38,744 --> 01:20:43,113
What were you asking when
I was talking on phone?

963
01:20:43,783 --> 01:20:45,045
You were abusing me,

964
01:20:45,284 --> 01:20:47,047
I took it easily as you
are a Telugu boy,

965
01:20:48,154 --> 01:20:50,122
Have you run away from home?

966
01:20:51,324 --> 01:20:54,782
Don't you've money to back?
My lorries are going, I'll give you lift.

967
01:20:55,094 --> 01:20:56,618
Tell me, what do you want?

968
01:20:57,430 --> 01:21:00,194
You were asking something
just a while ago.

969
01:21:00,433 --> 01:21:03,129
Why are you leaving before I finish?

970
01:21:05,338 --> 01:21:07,306
Do I look like a bore?

971
01:21:07,506 --> 01:21:10,304
I'm running apple business here
for the past 30 years,

972
01:21:12,178 --> 01:21:13,145
so what?

973
01:21:13,346 --> 01:21:14,973
Everyone here salutes me.

974
01:21:15,181 --> 01:21:16,307
Don't you know to respect others?

975
01:21:18,684 --> 01:21:20,709
Talk to me, I'm barking like a dog,

976
01:21:20,953 --> 01:21:24,684
talk to me, just one word,
can't you talk?

977
01:21:28,427 --> 01:21:35,833
Don't tease me,
I'll squeeze your neck like apples,

978
01:21:36,035 --> 01:21:41,769
talk to me, or
shall I strangle your neck?

979
01:21:43,542 --> 01:21:45,339
His punch is like Palakollu punch.

980
01:21:52,051 --> 01:21:57,683
I think you love Bala Govind.
- No madam.

981
01:21:58,391 --> 01:22:01,019
No, I can see it in your eyes.

982
01:22:01,294 --> 01:22:05,287
I can feel your heart's struggle.
- No, I'm not sad.

983
01:22:05,498 --> 01:22:07,022
You're stopping your tears.

984
01:22:08,668 --> 01:22:10,363
If you feel like crying,
cry out loud.

985
01:22:11,637 --> 01:22:13,036
I'm not crying.

986
01:22:13,239 --> 01:22:16,538
You needn't become a sanyasin
killing your love.

987
01:22:16,742 --> 01:22:19,540
There are no rules here,
you're young,

988
01:22:19,979 --> 01:22:23,813
gain experience, live,
marry Bala Govind,

989
01:22:24,016 --> 01:22:25,881
live with him, have children,

990
01:22:26,152 --> 01:22:29,212
if you think he's useless after that,
you can always come back here.

991
01:22:29,588 --> 01:22:30,555
We'll be here only.

992
01:22:31,090 --> 01:22:32,057
He's not like that.

993
01:22:32,258 --> 01:22:33,282
Then? How is he?

994
01:22:34,026 --> 01:22:35,050
Very good man.

995
01:22:35,261 --> 01:22:36,387
How can you say it?

996
01:22:36,595 --> 01:22:37,562
l strongly believe it.

997
01:22:37,763 --> 01:22:39,560
Is he still here or gone?

998
01:22:40,833 --> 01:22:44,735
I don't know, I think he might have left.

999
01:22:44,937 --> 01:22:46,632
Do you've his phone number,
I'll talk to him.

1000
01:22:46,839 --> 01:22:50,673
My visiting card, feel free to call me
whenever you get tempted.

1001
01:22:50,876 --> 01:22:52,571
One minute, I'll come back
in a second.

1002
01:23:00,219 --> 01:23:10,185
I dream

1003
01:23:22,708 --> 01:23:24,767
Is this the visiting card
you had lost?

1004
01:23:29,048 --> 01:23:30,777
He didn't go away.

1005
01:23:30,983 --> 01:23:34,441
He was hovering around
our Ashram for 2 days.

1006
01:23:34,720 --> 01:23:38,121
What will you do
if we give her to you?

1007
01:23:41,160 --> 01:23:42,889
Will you take and sell her?

1008
01:23:46,999 --> 01:23:48,557
Will you hang her to death?

1009
01:23:53,339 --> 01:23:55,967
Will you marry her? My sweet boy!

1010
01:23:57,510 --> 01:23:59,637
Vow of silence for you only!

1011
01:24:01,080 --> 01:24:04,379
Vaishali loves you very much.

1012
01:24:05,351 --> 01:24:07,376
She's not a sanyasin from tomorrow,

1013
01:24:08,354 --> 01:24:11,482
if you come tomorrow
I'll hand over her to you.

1014
01:24:39,385 --> 01:24:45,346
939535639... Reliance... 
you've the number.

1015
01:24:45,658 --> 01:24:48,525
But no trace of man,
my son is still in hospital.

1016
01:24:49,128 --> 01:24:52,529
Can we locate the place
of origin of call?

1017
01:24:52,731 --> 01:24:53,698
I don't think we can.

1018
01:24:54,066 --> 01:24:57,194
Can we know the tower?

1019
01:25:01,640 --> 01:25:03,369
Where are you Swami?

1020
01:25:06,078 --> 01:25:08,546
Look there! Hail Lord Shiva!

1021
01:25:10,249 --> 01:25:11,978
Greetings Swamiji!

1022
01:25:12,485 --> 01:25:13,213
When did you come here Swami?

1023
01:25:13,419 --> 01:25:15,216
I came, I searched for my wife,

1024
01:25:15,421 --> 01:25:17,321
she sold the property here
and left this place,

1025
01:25:17,490 --> 01:25:19,390
I'm sitting here without
knowing where to go.

1026
01:25:21,093 --> 01:25:22,219
We'll find your wife,

1027
01:25:22,595 --> 01:25:25,120
What did BSF people
do with you Swami?

1028
01:25:29,535 --> 01:25:32,231
They took me to Indian border
in an helicopter.

1029
01:25:39,111 --> 01:25:40,578
Do you want to blow up entire India?

1030
01:25:40,779 --> 01:25:44,408
I don't even smoke cigarette,
please leave me, I want to go home.

1031
01:25:44,617 --> 01:25:45,584
My wife is waiting.

1032
01:25:45,784 --> 01:25:49,242
Wife is waiting? My wife has
been waiting for years.- Oh no... .

1033
01:25:49,855 --> 01:25:52,085
I was with them for few days.

1034
01:25:55,027 --> 01:25:56,619
One fine day I escaped from them.

1035
01:26:00,466 --> 01:26:01,763
I jumped the fencing.

1036
01:26:05,404 --> 01:26:07,099
I jumped into Pakistan.

1037
01:26:24,323 --> 01:26:27,121
I ran into a group of Al-Qaida terrorists.

1038
01:26:34,567 --> 01:26:35,465
Who are you?

1039
01:26:36,502 --> 01:26:38,129
I'm a great fan of Al-Qaida.

1040
01:26:38,504 --> 01:26:39,300
Where are you coming from?

1041
01:26:39,505 --> 01:26:41,803
I'm coming from Hyderabad to meet you.

1042
01:26:48,113 --> 01:26:53,915
For my those words,
they gave 4 years weapons training.

1043
01:27:05,531 --> 01:27:07,158
Holy War!

1044
01:27:07,466 --> 01:27:08,330
Father!

1045
01:27:08,534 --> 01:27:10,263
Why are you shouting?
Tell me the matter.

1046
01:27:10,469 --> 01:27:12,664
My love is a grand success.

1047
01:27:12,871 --> 01:27:15,169
l came to know your love
story yesterday only.

1048
01:27:15,374 --> 01:27:17,342
Making her accept was
a thrilling climax.

1049
01:27:17,710 --> 01:27:20,770
They are going to hand over
her to me tomorrow.

1050
01:27:20,980 --> 01:27:25,178
She's an orphan,
there are no one to fight with me.

1051
01:27:26,051 --> 01:27:28,849
You'll also not raise objections,
because you're very weak.

1052
01:27:29,054 --> 01:27:32,683
Another news, the program we
shot is going to be telecast,

1053
01:27:32,891 --> 01:27:35,689
she's in the program,
you can see her.- Okay.

1054
01:27:35,894 --> 01:27:36,861
When it is being shown on TV?

1055
01:27:37,062 --> 01:27:38,359
It's on air now sir.
- Come, let's go.

1056
01:27:40,232 --> 01:27:44,726
This is Kulu Manali in Himachal Pradesh,
Solong valley here is... 

1057
01:27:44,937 --> 01:27:46,234
Have you seen that girl, Uncle?

1058
01:27:46,438 --> 01:27:51,137
Many women from different regions
of India are living in an Ashram,

1059
01:27:51,443 --> 01:27:52,569
it is a Community... 

1060
01:27:53,512 --> 01:28:03,478
I dream

1061
01:28:28,747 --> 01:28:31,875
Scary... thrilling... 

1062
01:28:32,451 --> 01:28:33,611
First time... 

1063
01:28:41,193 --> 01:28:42,854
Something strange... 

1064
01:28:43,095 --> 01:28:44,619
Mischievously... 

1065
01:28:44,830 --> 01:28:46,297
Cool... 

1066
01:28:46,865 --> 01:28:50,062
It thrills my body... 

1067
01:28:50,336 --> 01:28:52,065
My heart... 

1068
01:28:52,271 --> 01:28:53,795
Face of love... 

1069
01:28:54,006 --> 01:28:55,633
Cool drink in hot summer... 

1070
01:28:57,676 --> 01:28:59,405
My man... 

1071
01:28:59,611 --> 01:29:01,135
My best friend... 

1072
01:29:01,347 --> 01:29:03,042
Fundamental of love... 

1073
01:29:20,599 --> 01:29:30,565
I dream

1074
01:29:44,857 --> 01:29:51,524
Directions vanish when I meet you... 

1075
01:29:52,197 --> 01:29:58,966
Time stands still in the
magic created by you... 

1076
01:29:59,371 --> 01:30:05,970
My life is hitting a streak
of luck with you... 

1077
01:30:06,745 --> 01:30:13,378
My heart is tasting happiness
for the first time... 

1078
01:30:46,685 --> 01:30:56,651
I dream

1079
01:31:18,817 --> 01:31:25,723
Come into my life like an
unforgettable sweet memory... 

1080
01:31:26,191 --> 01:31:32,960
Be always with me like
the smile on my lip... 

1081
01:31:33,165 --> 01:31:36,293
You were born for me... 

1082
01:31:36,568 --> 01:31:39,969
Your love said that to me... 

1083
01:31:40,372 --> 01:31:43,398
You're in my heart... 

1084
01:31:43,775 --> 01:31:47,142
My breath says it... 

1085
01:32:24,550 --> 01:32:26,848
After vigourous weapons training,

1086
01:32:27,386 --> 01:32:28,910
I too became an active member,

1087
01:32:32,057 --> 01:32:35,026
unexpectedly I got a promotion too.

1088
01:32:39,731 --> 01:32:40,925
Do you what is this?

1089
01:32:42,768 --> 01:32:43,792
This is stick.

1090
01:32:44,570 --> 01:32:49,132
You fool, it's not a stick,
but twin towers of America.

1091
01:32:55,914 --> 01:32:59,213
We have to hijack a flight
and blow it up.

1092
01:33:05,924 --> 01:33:07,551
You've to command this operation.

1093
01:33:07,926 --> 01:33:09,723
Holy War!

1094
01:33:10,429 --> 01:33:12,397
Bloody idiots!

1095
01:33:12,864 --> 01:33:16,061
Were you involved in blowing up
of twin towers?

1096
01:33:16,935 --> 01:33:23,306
My foot, I got excited with that news
and was affected with dysentery.

1097
01:33:24,543 --> 01:33:26,909
I was left out in the last minute.

1098
01:33:28,880 --> 01:33:31,747
I lied to them that I'll plant
bombs in Delhi,

1099
01:33:32,784 --> 01:33:38,416
I went to Himalayas and
became 'Gudumba' Shankar.

1100
01:33:39,124 --> 01:33:40,751
I joined this group.

1101
01:33:41,893 --> 01:33:45,590
I want my wife back.
- Not this girl.

1102
01:33:47,566 --> 01:33:50,091
Please find my wife.
- Okay.

1103
01:34:00,879 --> 01:34:04,440
What was your first
impression about me?

1104
01:34:05,517 --> 01:34:06,108
Next?

1105
01:34:08,320 --> 01:34:09,116
Now... ?

1106
01:34:11,823 --> 01:34:13,620
Still I've the same impression.

1107
01:34:14,559 --> 01:34:18,552
But I've also become a fool like you.

1108
01:34:24,503 --> 01:34:25,367
Would you like to buy bangles?

1109
01:34:27,506 --> 01:34:28,302
Are you feeling cold?

1110
01:34:28,840 --> 01:34:30,808
Wait here, I'll get you a sweater.

1111
01:35:34,406 --> 01:35:35,873
I don't know who he is,
come let's go.

1112
01:35:43,915 --> 01:35:48,215
Catch those people... catch them... 

1113
01:36:58,056 --> 01:37:08,022
I dream

1114
01:38:34,119 --> 01:38:35,882
We know that she's an orphan,

1115
01:38:36,254 --> 01:38:39,553
we don't know her past,
who they are or why they are here?

1116
01:38:46,398 --> 01:38:49,890
You cheated us and left this place,

1117
01:38:50,101 --> 01:38:51,068
where did you go?

1118
01:38:53,204 --> 01:38:55,672
Look at me... bloody dirty face.

1119
01:39:01,846 --> 01:39:04,406
So, you stay in Kulu Manali..?

1120
01:39:06,284 --> 01:39:11,916
We were hunting you for
the last 2 years.

1121
01:39:13,358 --> 01:39:19,763
We came to know your whereabouts
when we saw you on TV.

1122
01:39:21,132 --> 01:39:24,260
Are you a sanyasin?

1123
01:39:25,637 --> 01:39:28,868
Say something.
Want to become a sanaysin?

1124
01:39:29,307 --> 01:39:30,274
Is Vaishali back?

1125
01:39:31,476 --> 01:39:33,444
Did you get her or did she come back?

1126
01:39:33,645 --> 01:39:34,270
We got her.

1127
01:39:34,479 --> 01:39:35,605
What do you mean by that?

1128
01:39:36,381 --> 01:39:40,442
Whether they got her or not?
- They got Vaishali.

1129
01:39:40,885 --> 01:39:41,783
Do you know who Vaishali is?

1130
01:39:41,987 --> 01:39:43,614
I don't care about that.

1131
01:39:43,822 --> 01:39:46,120
But you are happy.
That's more than enough.

1132
01:39:58,937 --> 01:40:00,131
They didn't recognize me.

1133
01:40:00,438 --> 01:40:01,962
But they came for that girl.

1134
01:40:02,607 --> 01:40:06,703
Now I must find the reason
and her whereabouts.

1135
01:40:10,615 --> 01:40:11,809
I am going to Dhoolpet.

1136
01:40:12,017 --> 01:40:15,646
No. They will kill you.
They are hunting for you.

1137
01:40:15,854 --> 01:40:18,152
Listen to me..please.

1138
01:40:29,167 --> 01:40:30,828
This is the house.

1139
01:40:41,446 --> 01:40:44,176
Go & inquire.
- But don't step out of the car.

1140
01:40:58,296 --> 01:41:08,262
I dream

1141
01:41:29,260 --> 01:41:30,693
Why did you come here?

1142
01:41:31,229 --> 01:41:32,526
If they see you, they will kill you.

1143
01:41:32,730 --> 01:41:33,594
Who are you?

1144
01:41:34,399 --> 01:41:36,697
You saved me from them.
Don't you remember?

1145
01:41:41,739 --> 01:41:43,366
Oh! It's you!

1146
01:41:45,076 --> 01:41:46,703
Do you know them?
- I know

1147
01:41:48,580 --> 01:41:50,047
Will you do me a favour?
- Tell me.

1148
01:41:51,082 --> 01:41:53,710
I'm in love with a girl.
They kidnapped her.

1149
01:41:53,918 --> 01:41:55,886
Are you talking about Vaishali?

1150
01:41:58,423 --> 01:42:00,721
Do you know her?
-Yes, I know.

1151
01:42:01,426 --> 01:42:03,326
They tried to kill me
because of Vaishali.

1152
01:42:03,862 --> 01:42:05,489
Do you know who Vaishali is?

1153
01:42:05,930 --> 01:42:07,227
Narayana Patwari's daughter.

1154
01:42:10,168 --> 01:42:12,068
He means terror to everyone.

1155
01:42:16,274 --> 01:42:20,074
Myself, Thambidurai, Ponnuswamy,
Murugesan used to work for him.

1156
01:42:23,148 --> 01:42:24,740
Vaishali is his only daughter.

1157
01:42:28,319 --> 01:42:31,755
Thambidurai & Ponnuswamy
eyed for his wealth.

1158
01:42:36,127 --> 01:42:43,260
Patwari, get your daughter
married to Murugesan.

1159
01:42:45,904 --> 01:42:49,101
How dare you wish my daughter to
become wife of my henchman?

1160
01:42:51,976 --> 01:42:55,434
Do you want to sleep with
my daughter on my bed?

1161
01:42:55,647 --> 01:42:56,875
I will kill you all.

1162
01:42:58,316 --> 01:43:00,443
I will kill you first.
- No.

1163
01:43:05,056 --> 01:43:07,957
There is nothing wrong in it.

1164
01:43:08,993 --> 01:43:10,961
Did you & your daughter
came down from heaven?

1165
01:43:15,667 --> 01:43:16,292
Father... 

1166
01:43:21,940 --> 01:43:23,805
They killed her parents
in a blink of an eye.

1167
01:43:24,776 --> 01:43:25,800
I was left helpless.

1168
01:43:26,010 --> 01:43:27,637
Murugesan, tie the auspicious thread.

1169
01:43:27,845 --> 01:43:29,813
Tie it in front of him.

1170
01:43:30,014 --> 01:43:33,313
I will see what he will do.
What will you do?

1171
01:43:33,518 --> 01:43:34,985
Now it's all your wealth.

1172
01:43:35,753 --> 01:43:37,914
I wanted to save Vaishali.

1173
01:43:42,627 --> 01:43:43,150
Run fast... 

1174
01:43:47,832 --> 01:43:48,491
Go.

1175
01:44:00,878 --> 01:44:04,336
l succeeded in escaping from them.
But I lost Vaishali.

1176
01:44:04,716 --> 01:44:06,343
I didn't know where she went.

1177
01:44:06,551 --> 01:44:08,519
I searched everywhere but in vain.

1178
01:44:08,720 --> 01:44:11,018
They believe that I helped
her go underground.

1179
01:44:11,222 --> 01:44:13,520
Vaishali is back in their clutches.

1180
01:44:15,393 --> 01:44:17,691
You must save Vaishali at any cost.

1181
01:44:29,240 --> 01:44:30,036
Where is the police station?

1182
01:44:30,241 --> 01:44:32,038
You both might be in love.

1183
01:44:32,577 --> 01:44:38,538
But rescuing her from Thambidurai's
house is not an easy task.

1184
01:44:38,750 --> 01:44:40,547
But you also say that she is married.

1185
01:44:40,752 --> 01:44:43,550
Whatever happened in front of her
dead parents is not a marriage.

1186
01:44:44,589 --> 01:44:45,886
Only we know that.

1187
01:44:46,257 --> 01:44:48,555
But they are spinning different stories.

1188
01:44:48,760 --> 01:44:50,728
They say that Patwari was
killed by someone else

1189
01:44:50,928 --> 01:44:54,056
they are looking after his family now.

1190
01:44:54,265 --> 01:44:56,392
We all know that he is a criminal.

1191
01:44:56,601 --> 01:44:59,229
But there is neither a witness
nor proof.

1192
01:45:00,271 --> 01:45:03,069
That's why our hands are tied down.

1193
01:45:03,274 --> 01:45:05,401
If I rescue her now,

1194
01:45:05,610 --> 01:45:07,737
a case will be lodged against me
for arresting his daughter-in-law.

1195
01:45:07,979 --> 01:45:12,575
So, the bottomline is
I can't help you.

1196
01:45:13,251 --> 01:45:14,240
Thank you sir.

1197
01:45:20,858 --> 01:45:22,086
Your name is Bala Govind, right?

1198
01:45:23,127 --> 01:45:24,754
Did you hit Murugesan?

1199
01:45:25,630 --> 01:45:27,598
Shake hands I say.

1200
01:45:28,866 --> 01:45:34,270
Beat everyone black & blue.
I will help you.

1201
01:45:34,472 --> 01:45:34,938
Thank you sir.

1202
01:45:35,139 --> 01:45:36,936
Beat them to pulp.

1203
01:45:45,483 --> 01:45:47,451
Eat a little.
- No.

1204
01:45:55,660 --> 01:45:58,458
If I smash your head against the wall,

1205
01:45:58,663 --> 01:46:02,292
it will break into pieces. Eat fast.

1206
01:46:02,500 --> 01:46:05,799
We need your wealth not you.

1207
01:46:06,137 --> 01:46:10,164
Better live with Murugesan.

1208
01:46:10,675 --> 01:46:12,802
After 6 months, if you find it
difficult to live with him,

1209
01:46:13,010 --> 01:46:14,307
..commit suicide.

1210
01:46:14,512 --> 01:46:19,142
Else I will kill you. Got it?

1211
01:46:20,017 --> 01:46:21,143
Tell her.

1212
01:46:27,692 --> 01:46:29,319
Why there are so many men on guard?

1213
01:46:29,527 --> 01:46:30,323
Are they all goons?

1214
01:46:32,363 --> 01:46:33,660
Vaishali is here.

1215
01:46:35,366 --> 01:46:37,163
I must see Vaishali for once.

1216
01:46:37,368 --> 01:46:38,164
That's impossible.

1217
01:46:38,369 --> 01:46:40,667
She is in that house. I will go now.

1218
01:46:40,872 --> 01:46:42,169
You don't know about them.

1219
01:46:42,373 --> 01:46:43,670
They don't know about me.

1220
01:46:43,875 --> 01:46:47,504
Hey you! Cut the power.
- No.

1221
01:46:48,379 --> 01:46:51,007
If you cut the power,
I will go & see Vaishali.

1222
01:46:51,549 --> 01:46:52,846
If possible, I will come back with her.

1223
01:46:53,050 --> 01:46:55,518
If nothing is possible,
I will beat some guy & come.

1224
01:46:56,554 --> 01:46:57,521
Cut the power lines.

1225
01:47:00,725 --> 01:47:03,193
Power cuts now?

1226
01:47:10,568 --> 01:47:11,865
Light the candles.

1227
01:47:15,573 --> 01:47:20,374
We must call the Minister and
warn the electrical dept.

1228
01:47:20,578 --> 01:47:21,545
Sure.

1229
01:47:26,083 --> 01:47:27,880
Where is the candle?

1230
01:47:28,753 --> 01:47:29,549
You pot boy!

1231
01:47:31,656 --> 01:47:34,887
Who are you? Keep the pot down
and light the candle.

1232
01:47:38,429 --> 01:47:40,397
There are so many of you guys at home.

1233
01:47:40,598 --> 01:47:42,725
But none has any common sense.

1234
01:48:03,621 --> 01:48:05,919
So long to light a candle?

1235
01:48:13,130 --> 01:48:16,258
The entire house is dark.
l could see nothing.

1236
01:48:18,469 --> 01:48:19,094
Where are you going?

1237
01:48:19,303 --> 01:48:20,429
Keep the candle in her room.

1238
01:49:00,945 --> 01:49:03,846
Don't worry. I'm there for you.

1239
01:49:05,049 --> 01:49:17,621
The hearts... have united... 

1240
01:49:24,335 --> 01:49:29,136
Only silence remained in my heart... 

1241
01:49:29,373 --> 01:49:33,969
As I got to you, it melted like snow... 

1242
01:49:34,178 --> 01:49:36,476
Where are you?

1243
01:49:36,681 --> 01:49:39,149
You came just now... 

1244
01:49:39,350 --> 01:49:44,151
I will keep you safe in my eyes... 

1245
01:49:45,823 --> 01:49:55,789
I dream

1246
01:50:14,552 --> 01:50:16,850
I dreamt for you... 

1247
01:50:17,054 --> 01:50:19,352
In my dreams I saw you... 

1248
01:50:29,734 --> 01:50:32,032
Though we are separated... 

1249
01:50:32,236 --> 01:50:34,864
I'm following you as your shadow... 

1250
01:50:40,244 --> 01:50:45,045
You laid a trap in my heart... 

1251
01:50:45,249 --> 01:50:50,050
What are you? A dream or a wave?
You have sunk me in it.

1252
01:50:55,259 --> 01:50:59,889
Before I could come out of your hallucination... 

1253
01:51:00,097 --> 01:51:05,057
your memories overtake me... 

1254
01:51:05,436 --> 01:51:10,396
l preserved my love for you... 

1255
01:51:10,608 --> 01:51:15,409
I will share my passion with you... 

1256
01:51:15,780 --> 01:51:25,087
Together... 

1257
01:51:25,623 --> 01:51:38,559
You lit fire in me with
your burning kisses... 

1258
01:52:00,991 --> 01:52:10,798
Wet me with your sweat... 

1259
01:52:14,972 --> 01:52:24,938
I dream

1260
01:52:39,029 --> 01:52:44,160
You have cast a spell on my soul... 

1261
01:52:44,368 --> 01:52:48,998
You filled my life with love and passion... 

1262
01:52:54,044 --> 01:52:58,344
Before I could hear your echoes of love... 

1263
01:52:58,549 --> 01:53:04,010
you overtake me with your lust... 

1264
01:53:04,388 --> 01:53:09,189
When seconds turn into aeons
and entangle me... 

1265
01:53:09,393 --> 01:53:14,194
l came to you seeking refuge... 

1266
01:53:14,565 --> 01:53:24,372
Together... 

1267
01:53:24,742 --> 01:53:30,044
You elate me & crush me
in your love... 

1268
01:53:33,050 --> 01:53:43,016
I dream

1269
01:53:52,002 --> 01:53:54,664
Let's go, Vaishali.

1270
01:54:04,949 --> 01:54:05,745
Why are you standing here?

1271
01:54:05,950 --> 01:54:07,247
Planning to escape?

1272
01:54:07,451 --> 01:54:11,410
Did you think you could cheat us? Go.

1273
01:54:11,622 --> 01:54:14,090
How dare you try to escape again?

1274
01:54:14,291 --> 01:54:16,759
You can't play your tricks with me.

1275
01:54:17,795 --> 01:54:18,420
Yes Bala.

1276
01:54:18,629 --> 01:54:19,425
Switch on the power.

1277
01:54:19,630 --> 01:54:20,597
No. They will kill you.

1278
01:54:20,798 --> 01:54:22,766
Do as I say. Switch on the power.

1279
01:54:22,967 --> 01:54:24,264
Come. Come I say.

1280
01:54:26,503 --> 01:54:28,095
Thank God! The power is back.

1281
01:54:29,306 --> 01:54:30,273
Look at her.

1282
01:54:32,977 --> 01:54:33,602
What happened?

1283
01:54:33,811 --> 01:54:37,269
She was planning to escape in the dark.

1284
01:54:38,148 --> 01:54:39,775
You can never escape.

1285
01:54:40,150 --> 01:54:43,950
Only Murugesan can keep you in track.

1286
01:54:45,322 --> 01:54:47,290
Now switch off the power.

1287
01:54:50,828 --> 01:54:54,787
Why is this power is tripping often?

1288
01:54:55,065 --> 01:54:56,794
Call the Electricity Dept.

1289
01:54:57,067 --> 01:55:00,127
If the power goes off again, I will... 

1290
01:55:03,841 --> 01:55:04,808
Who hit me?

1291
01:55:05,175 --> 01:55:06,802
Catch him.

1292
01:55:07,077 --> 01:55:07,975
Find out who hit me.

1293
01:55:08,913 --> 01:55:19,221
Who hit me?

1294
01:55:19,523 --> 01:55:21,150
Go & search.

1295
01:55:22,192 --> 01:55:25,821
Drink this & narrate your experiences.

1296
01:55:27,031 --> 01:55:28,999
Once I became a sanyasi I lost everything.

1297
01:55:30,034 --> 01:55:32,332
Now my only problem is to find my wife.

1298
01:55:32,870 --> 01:55:34,997
Since you all are from MAA TV,

1299
01:55:35,205 --> 01:55:37,673
this is my wife's photo.

1300
01:55:37,875 --> 01:55:40,673
Show this photo on your TV
and help me to find my wife.

1301
01:55:41,545 --> 01:55:42,170
Shivani... ?

1302
01:55:42,379 --> 01:55:43,346
Is Shivani your wife?

1303
01:55:44,048 --> 01:55:45,515
How do you guys know my wife?

1304
01:55:46,383 --> 01:55:47,850
She is our friend.
- Friend?

1305
01:55:48,118 --> 01:55:52,521
We met her in Manali as a sanyasin
when we went there for a shoot.

1306
01:55:53,223 --> 01:55:55,691
Is my wife in Manali?
-Yes.

1307
01:55:55,893 --> 01:55:58,020
After you divorced her,
she married again.

1308
01:55:58,228 --> 01:55:59,695
Since he didn't buy her a silk sari,

1309
01:55:59,897 --> 01:56:01,364
she went to Manali & became a sanyasin.

1310
01:56:02,566 --> 01:56:04,363
Why didn't you tell me that
she was in Manali?

1311
01:56:04,568 --> 01:56:06,695
If you had told us,
we would united you both.

1312
01:56:07,738 --> 01:56:13,370
l beg you all to unite me
with my wife.

1313
01:56:14,411 --> 01:56:16,879
Or else give me her address.
I will go there myself.

1314
01:56:17,081 --> 01:56:19,709
The gap between us is widening.

1315
01:56:19,917 --> 01:56:22,385
Don't worry. It is our responsibility
to unite you both.

1316
01:56:22,586 --> 01:56:23,382
Drink this.

1317
01:56:23,587 --> 01:56:25,054
Sure?
- Sure.

1318
01:56:26,423 --> 01:56:27,720
Decorate properly.
- Okay.

1319
01:56:30,761 --> 01:56:31,887
Get up.

1320
01:56:32,162 --> 01:56:33,220
Get up I say.

1321
01:56:33,597 --> 01:56:35,394
Decorate well.

1322
01:56:35,599 --> 01:56:38,397
My son is coming home from hospital.

1323
01:56:38,769 --> 01:56:40,396
Today is his first night.

1324
01:56:42,106 --> 01:56:44,233
Why are you scared?

1325
01:56:44,942 --> 01:56:47,069
Aren't you interested in first night?

1326
01:56:47,611 --> 01:56:49,579
Aren't you interested in Murugesan?

1327
01:56:50,447 --> 01:56:53,075
You must be lucky to get
my son as your husband.

1328
01:56:53,283 --> 01:56:59,085
He is a hero to all girls
in Tamil Nadu.

1329
01:57:00,624 --> 01:57:01,420
Come here.

1330
01:57:02,326 --> 01:57:03,258
Take her.

1331
01:57:04,661 --> 01:57:06,094
Take her & get her ready.

1332
01:57:07,464 --> 01:57:08,761
Learn from her.

1333
01:57:08,966 --> 01:57:11,935
We dumped her here and
she got adjusted with us.

1334
01:57:12,202 --> 01:57:15,433
After a couple of days,
everything will be fine.

1335
01:57:15,639 --> 01:57:17,800
Murugesan... 
-Yes uncle.

1336
01:57:17,975 --> 01:57:19,442
Come fast.

1337
01:57:19,810 --> 01:57:22,278
Today is your first night.

1338
01:57:22,479 --> 01:57:23,605
First night?

1339
01:57:23,814 --> 01:57:25,281
What do you mean by first night?

1340
01:57:26,350 --> 01:57:27,612
First night.

1341
01:57:28,485 --> 01:57:29,611
You are very lucky.

1342
01:57:29,820 --> 01:57:32,118
From hospital bed to bed of roses.

1343
01:57:33,157 --> 01:57:40,791
I remember my first night.

1344
01:57:40,998 --> 01:57:44,126
A night full of quarrels & tiffs.

1345
01:57:44,835 --> 01:57:45,802
Stop here.

1346
01:57:54,578 --> 01:57:57,809
Bala, today is Murugesan's
first night with Vaishali.

1347
01:57:58,015 --> 01:57:59,141
First night..?

1348
01:58:05,522 --> 01:58:06,819
Bala, Sher... 

1349
01:58:08,358 --> 01:58:09,484
He saw us.

1350
01:58:14,031 --> 01:58:15,498
You people just walk away.

1351
01:58:15,699 --> 01:58:16,495
I will handle them.

1352
01:58:20,537 --> 01:58:21,504
Run... 

1353
01:58:55,372 --> 01:59:05,338
I dream

1354
02:01:20,050 --> 02:01:22,348
Do what you can, you idiot!

1355
02:01:22,552 --> 02:01:23,849
C'mon hit me... 

1356
02:01:32,562 --> 02:01:33,358
Yes, tell me.

1357
02:01:34,931 --> 02:01:36,023
What happened?

1358
02:01:36,233 --> 02:01:37,860
Give the phone to the one near by.

1359
02:01:38,735 --> 02:01:40,703
Give it to anyone near you... 

1360
02:01:49,980 --> 02:01:50,537
What happened?

1361
02:01:58,422 --> 02:01:59,389
Scoundrels!

1362
02:01:59,589 --> 02:02:01,716
Now I am going to torture them.

1363
02:02:05,095 --> 02:02:06,221
Greetings sir.

1364
02:02:06,496 --> 02:02:07,394
Who are you?

1365
02:02:07,597 --> 02:02:10,065
I am Bala Govind speaking.

1366
02:02:10,934 --> 02:02:12,231
Bala Govind... ?

1367
02:02:12,502 --> 02:02:14,231
Did you forget me?

1368
02:02:14,438 --> 02:02:15,405
Should I remember you?

1369
02:02:15,939 --> 02:02:17,566
Ask Murugesan.

1370
02:02:19,109 --> 02:02:21,737
Don't you know to take revenge?

1371
02:02:23,113 --> 02:02:25,240
Have you guys forgot to take revenge?

1372
02:02:26,116 --> 02:02:27,743
How could you forget me?

1373
02:02:27,951 --> 02:02:29,578
Hey you... 

1374
02:02:32,289 --> 02:02:35,087
You wanted me to come
to Hyderabad, didn't you?

1375
02:02:35,292 --> 02:02:36,088
I have come to Hyderabad.

1376
02:02:36,293 --> 02:02:39,592
I am in Dhoolpet.
What can you do?

1377
02:02:39,796 --> 02:02:42,594
Today is a first night for all of you.

1378
02:02:44,134 --> 02:02:45,431
Come here.

1379
02:02:45,802 --> 02:02:47,929
What will you do? Tell me.

1380
02:02:48,138 --> 02:02:49,002
Shit!

1381
02:02:49,873 --> 02:02:51,602
Bala Govind is in town.

1382
02:02:51,808 --> 02:02:53,275
Go. Find him & bring him here.

1383
02:02:53,477 --> 02:02:55,445
Go & search everywhere.

1384
02:03:05,155 --> 02:03:06,782
What? Is he in town?

1385
02:03:07,824 --> 02:03:09,621
I am coming from hospital.

1386
02:03:09,826 --> 02:03:11,123
I want him by the time
I reach home.

1387
02:03:12,162 --> 02:03:13,959
Sign on this discharge register.

1388
02:03:14,164 --> 02:03:16,632
Keep the bed ready.
He will need it.

1389
02:03:20,670 --> 02:03:21,796
We met long back.

1390
02:03:22,839 --> 02:03:23,635
Is your health okay?

1391
02:03:54,538 --> 02:03:58,668
Do you think I took my vengeance?
No.

1392
02:03:58,875 --> 02:03:59,842
This is fresh.

1393
02:04:00,544 --> 02:04:01,670
Shall I tell you something new?

1394
02:04:03,046 --> 02:04:05,844
The so called your wife Vaishali.

1395
02:04:06,383 --> 02:04:08,180
We both are in love.

1396
02:04:09,119 --> 02:04:10,711
Are you shocked?

1397
02:04:10,987 --> 02:04:13,217
l heard that today is your first night.

1398
02:04:14,558 --> 02:04:16,185
Do you want to celebrate your night?

1399
02:04:27,137 --> 02:04:28,604
Oh my Murugesan!

1400
02:04:28,805 --> 02:04:31,774
Find him & chop him into pieces. Go.

1401
02:04:33,710 --> 02:04:43,676
I dream

1402
02:04:55,499 --> 02:05:00,459
A handsome will come for me... 

1403
02:05:05,008 --> 02:05:07,636
He wants me even when I disagree... 

1404
02:05:07,844 --> 02:05:09,971
He casts a spell on me... 

1405
02:05:14,918 --> 02:05:19,480
You are too beautiful... 

1406
02:05:19,689 --> 02:05:24,490
You are too good... 

1407
02:05:26,696 --> 02:05:31,827
You sparked the fire in me... 

1408
02:05:32,035 --> 02:05:36,665
You make go breathless
touching my sensitive parts... 

1409
02:05:43,780 --> 02:05:53,746
I dream

1410
02:06:06,303 --> 02:06:08,533
Wear your outfit properly... 

1411
02:06:08,738 --> 02:06:11,036
Don't play with hearts... 

1412
02:06:11,408 --> 02:06:15,708
Won't your beauty enter the
Guinness book of world records..

1413
02:06:16,079 --> 02:06:20,709
You're 21 and I'm 25... 

1414
02:06:20,917 --> 02:06:25,718
Do me anything... 
But sing the song of love... 

1415
02:06:26,256 --> 02:06:30,716
l dazzle you with my love games... 

1416
02:06:30,927 --> 02:06:35,728
I will make our nights a memorable one... 

1417
02:06:36,099 --> 02:06:38,226
With loads of love... 

1418
02:06:40,770 --> 02:06:43,068
... romance with me... 

1419
02:06:45,609 --> 02:06:50,569
I will get myself stuck to your waist line... 

1420
02:07:06,863 --> 02:07:16,829
I dream

1421
02:07:29,653 --> 02:07:31,951
Come to me when you are cocky... .

1422
02:07:32,155 --> 02:07:34,282
Devour all my pleasures... 

1423
02:07:34,491 --> 02:07:39,292
It's your right to do anything with me... 

1424
02:07:39,663 --> 02:07:41,790
I am bamboozled when
your clothes fall... 

1425
02:07:41,998 --> 02:07:44,125
You will be in trouble if I go wild.

1426
02:07:44,401 --> 02:07:48,963
Your shyness vanishes in air
when I taste the nectar in you... 

1427
02:07:49,539 --> 02:07:54,135
Let me see how aggressive you are... 

1428
02:07:54,511 --> 02:07:58,811
I will come & make you crumble
in my embrace... 

1429
02:07:59,015 --> 02:08:06,649
Play my drums... 
- I'll play it babe... 

1430
02:08:09,025 --> 02:08:11,323
He is bold & courageous... 

1431
02:08:11,528 --> 02:08:13,826
He's a boy wonder!

1432
02:09:28,605 --> 02:09:29,572
Don't take him to hospital.

1433
02:09:29,773 --> 02:09:33,231
l need ice cubes & a small fan.

1434
02:09:34,444 --> 02:09:35,911
Get them.

1435
02:09:37,280 --> 02:09:40,078
Don't cry. You will be fine.

1436
02:09:40,283 --> 02:09:42,911
You will be alright. Switch on the fan.

1437
02:09:51,628 --> 02:09:52,424
What's the problem?

1438
02:10:06,609 --> 02:10:07,507
What do you mean?

1439
02:10:07,811 --> 02:10:08,607
l understood.

1440
02:10:08,812 --> 02:10:10,245
What?
- If you permit, I'll tell you.

1441
02:10:10,480 --> 02:10:11,447
Hold this.

1442
02:10:14,217 --> 02:10:15,275
How to explain them?

1443
02:10:16,653 --> 02:10:18,951
Have you seen a bulb?

1444
02:10:19,823 --> 02:10:20,949
It has a filament.

1445
02:10:22,492 --> 02:10:23,618
If filament breaks,

1446
02:10:23,827 --> 02:10:26,295
the bulb might or might not glow.

1447
02:10:29,332 --> 02:10:31,960
Your nest is damaged.

1448
02:10:32,168 --> 02:10:34,136
And... .it has broken.

1449
02:10:34,337 --> 02:10:41,140
Who hit you, my boy?

1450
02:10:41,511 --> 02:10:43,479
Shut up.

1451
02:10:43,847 --> 02:10:46,816
Father, Bala Govind & she are in love.

1452
02:10:49,185 --> 02:10:52,313
Beat her & she will tell us where he is.

1453
02:10:52,589 --> 02:10:53,487
Move.

1454
02:10:59,529 --> 02:11:00,996
Do you love him?

1455
02:11:04,868 --> 02:11:07,496
Do you love him?

1456
02:11:10,707 --> 02:11:16,839
Tell me... where is he?

1457
02:11:17,213 --> 02:11:20,011
I will tell you.

1458
02:11:21,885 --> 02:11:22,852
I will tell you.

1459
02:11:31,060 --> 02:11:32,357
What is she doing?

1460
02:11:33,229 --> 02:11:35,026
It's a very bad sign.

1461
02:11:40,670 --> 02:11:42,297
They are beating Vaishali mercilessly.

1462
02:11:42,505 --> 02:11:44,803
Take Vaishali with you.

1463
02:11:46,009 --> 02:11:49,137
Sir, you need proof to
put them behind bars.

1464
02:11:50,013 --> 02:11:51,310
l need Vaishali.

1465
02:11:52,248 --> 02:11:53,545
What should I do now?

1466
02:11:54,117 --> 02:11:58,417
Let me have Dhoolpet
for a couple of hours.

1467
02:11:59,622 --> 02:12:01,249
That is enough.

1468
02:12:01,624 --> 02:12:03,251
What should I do till then?

1469
02:12:06,129 --> 02:12:07,426
Watch MAA TV.

1470
02:12:29,118 --> 02:12:29,914
Where are you?

1471
02:12:30,119 --> 02:12:32,246
Bala Govind hit Sher.

1472
02:12:32,455 --> 02:12:33,581
He broke his head.

1473
02:12:35,358 --> 02:12:36,916
Where?

1474
02:12:40,630 --> 02:12:42,598
Now I am going there.
- No Bala.

1475
02:12:42,799 --> 02:12:44,096
They will kill you if they recognize you.

1476
02:12:44,300 --> 02:12:46,268
If they recognize me,
the story will be different.

1477
02:12:46,469 --> 02:12:48,266
If they don't, it will be very different.

1478
02:12:49,639 --> 02:12:51,266
Got a knife?
- Take it.

1479
02:12:58,815 --> 02:13:01,113
Let's confuse them.

1480
02:13:04,320 --> 02:13:06,618
He hit our Sher.

1481
02:13:06,823 --> 02:13:08,290
Stop here.

1482
02:13:08,491 --> 02:13:15,693
He hit our Sher.

1483
02:13:15,832 --> 02:13:18,300
Where is the Big boss?

1484
02:13:18,501 --> 02:13:22,961
Boss, they hit our Sher.

1485
02:13:26,009 --> 02:13:28,136
Who are you?
- Greetings sir.

1486
02:13:28,511 --> 02:13:30,138
My name is Basheer.

1487
02:13:30,346 --> 02:13:32,143
Bala Govind is here.

1488
02:13:32,515 --> 02:13:35,973
I was coming to tell you this,
but he stabbed me with this knife.

1489
02:13:36,185 --> 02:13:37,311
Go & catch him.

1490
02:13:37,520 --> 02:13:40,489
Where is he?
-Very close by.

1491
02:13:41,190 --> 02:13:42,817
Let's go & kill him.

1492
02:13:43,860 --> 02:13:45,327
Chop him into pieces.

1493
02:13:46,029 --> 02:13:46,996
What happened?

1494
02:13:49,365 --> 02:13:50,161
Just move.

1495
02:13:50,533 --> 02:13:52,330
Where do you live in this area?

1496
02:13:53,369 --> 02:13:54,666
I've never seen you before.

1497
02:14:05,715 --> 02:14:06,682
It's him.

1498
02:14:07,050 --> 02:14:08,517
You should not get up. No.

1499
02:14:08,885 --> 02:14:09,852
Who are you?

1500
02:14:10,219 --> 02:14:11,186
Oh my God!

1501
02:14:11,888 --> 02:14:12,855
Catch him.

1502
02:14:14,590 --> 02:14:15,352
Come fast.

1503
02:14:15,892 --> 02:14:18,019
No.
- Kill him.

1504
02:14:21,397 --> 02:14:23,524
Oh no! Who hit you?

1505
02:14:25,068 --> 02:14:26,729
Search properly.

1506
02:14:30,406 --> 02:14:32,533
Stop. Your balls are in good shape.

1507
02:14:36,579 --> 02:14:37,045
Get me the gun.

1508
02:14:48,091 --> 02:14:48,887
Go that side.

1509
02:15:09,345 --> 02:15:19,311
I dream

1510
02:15:41,811 --> 02:15:45,269
Run away Bala.

1511
02:16:19,182 --> 02:16:20,308
Go... 

1512
02:16:21,184 --> 02:16:22,981
Go I say.

1513
02:16:35,698 --> 02:16:36,665
Kill him.

1514
02:17:08,564 --> 02:17:09,861
Let her go.

1515
02:17:10,066 --> 02:17:10,532
Go.

1516
02:17:15,071 --> 02:17:15,696
Me... ?

1517
02:17:24,247 --> 02:17:25,214
Come.

1518
02:17:27,650 --> 02:17:28,548
Get an auto.

1519
02:17:36,592 --> 02:17:37,559
Where is he?

1520
02:18:02,618 --> 02:18:03,585
Get him.

1521
02:18:51,734 --> 02:18:53,964
Switch on the camera. Make it fast.

1522
02:18:54,337 --> 02:18:55,463
Start immediately.

1523
02:19:31,207 --> 02:19:31,832
Shoot him down.

1524
02:19:36,545 --> 02:19:37,341
Shoot.

1525
02:19:50,126 --> 02:19:51,024
Leave me.

1526
02:19:51,394 --> 02:19:53,021
Don't miss anything.

1527
02:19:53,229 --> 02:19:53,695
Everything must be very neatly shot.

1528
02:20:15,251 --> 02:20:15,876
I'm Soni.

1529
02:20:16,152 --> 02:20:18,382
Breaking news for MAA TV viewers.

1530
02:20:54,123 --> 02:20:56,250
A gruesome attack in
Hyderabad 20 minutes back.

1531
02:20:57,293 --> 02:21:03,254
Thambidurai & Ponnuswamy's gang are
on the streets to kill a boy & a girl.

1532
02:21:08,137 --> 02:21:11,106
There was no evidence till now for their crimes.
This is a fool proof evidence.

1533
02:21:11,307 --> 02:21:14,276
They were chasing them
on the Dhoolpet streets.

1534
02:21:35,331 --> 02:21:38,300
Their friends who supported
their love were tortured.

1535
02:21:46,342 --> 02:21:51,143
They were barbaric beasts
hurting women too.

1536
02:22:30,719 --> 02:22:32,846
Police & government says that
there is no evidence against them.

1537
02:22:33,055 --> 02:22:34,522
What else do they need now?

1538
02:22:36,058 --> 02:22:37,355
They might kill my son.

1539
02:22:38,561 --> 02:22:41,689
This is enough. Let's go.

1540
02:23:59,742 --> 02:24:01,710
How are you, my son?

1541
02:24:01,910 --> 02:24:03,036
Are you telecasting this or not?

1542
02:24:03,245 --> 02:24:04,542
It is being telecast.

1543
02:24:04,747 --> 02:24:06,715
Why haven't the police come yet?

1544
02:24:06,915 --> 02:24:09,042
Police are coming.

1545
02:24:09,251 --> 02:24:10,377
They are always late.

1546
02:24:14,256 --> 02:24:15,883
You said our bodies are mere mud.

1547
02:24:16,091 --> 02:24:17,217
Look what has happened.

1548
02:24:20,429 --> 02:24:21,396
l may be smiling.

1549
02:24:21,597 --> 02:24:24,395
But actually the pain is killing me.

1550
02:24:25,267 --> 02:24:29,067
At last the police has arrived.

1551
02:24:34,943 --> 02:24:36,911
The flames of love is burning high.

1552
02:24:41,283 --> 02:24:41,908
Mother... 

1553
02:24:42,951 --> 02:24:44,077
Hello Prabha!

1554
02:24:44,286 --> 02:24:47,084
How are you?
- Great couple!

1555
02:24:48,123 --> 02:24:50,091
When did you come?
- Today.

1556
02:24:50,626 --> 02:24:52,093
We were planning to have
our first night here.

1557
02:24:52,961 --> 02:24:53,928
Oh no! Not here.

1558
02:24:54,229 --> 02:24:56,925
l decided to have my first night
here long back.

1559
02:24:57,132 --> 02:24:59,259
Please don't come here for
the next 3 days. Got it?

1560
02:24:59,468 --> 02:25:00,264
I feel very shy.

1561
02:25:00,469 --> 02:25:02,767
Let's go, Mother.
- Excuse me Shivani.

1562
02:25:02,971 --> 02:25:04,438
A surprise for you.
-What?

1563
02:25:04,640 --> 02:25:05,766
Look there.

1564
02:25:06,008 --> 02:25:07,270
Do you recognize him?

1565
02:25:15,884 --> 02:25:18,444
Where were you all these days?

1566
02:25:19,555 --> 02:25:20,954
Please don't ask me that.

1567
02:25:33,669 --> 02:25:34,966
Hold this!

1568
02:25:38,307 --> 02:25:42,004
Leave immediately, or else everyone in
our Ashram will wish for marriage.

1569
02:25:42,177 --> 02:25:43,804
Please leave this place.

1570
02:25:44,980 --> 02:25:54,946
I dream
