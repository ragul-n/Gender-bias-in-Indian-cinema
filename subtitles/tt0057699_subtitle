1
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:08,129
It is written
in the Holy Bible that...

2
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:11,649
one day Jesus Christ was passing
the market place...

3
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:15,929
He saw some people
stoning a woman.

4
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:21,009
On asking the reason, they
answered that she had sinned...

5
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:23,249
and they would kill her.

6
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:28,729
To this Jesus said it was fine but
the person who has never sinned...

7
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:31,249
should cast the first stone.

8
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:34,049
All of them stopped.

9
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:38,809
Jesus said the greatest punishment
for person who has sinned was...

10
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:42,929
his repentance and tears of regret.

11
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:54,249
"If the right was given
to commit sin..."

12
00:01:56,210 --> 00:02:01,249
"let me also have
the right to repent"

13
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:08,729
"For my actions..."

14
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:16,249
"let me have the right
to be ashamed"

15
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:22,889
"What good is spurning someone..."

16
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:30,249
"who is already spurned?"

17
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:37,249
"If the right was given
to fall..."

18
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:44,409
"let me also have the right
to stand up on my feet"

19
00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:00,249
"The soul is destroyed..."

20
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:05,249
"and the heart is ruined"

21
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:10,249
"Now that a sin is committed..."

22
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:14,849
"stop another
from being committed"

23
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:09,729
"Do not shut the doors..."

24
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:14,249
"for a sinner"

25
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:19,009
"If You will..."

26
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:23,449
"help this miserable world"

27
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:28,249
"In its own fire..."

28
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:32,769
"the heart burns
like a lamp"

29
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:37,769
"Now that a sin is committed..."

30
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:41,969
"stop another
from being committed"

31
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:42,849
"O God of the Suns
and the Moons..."

32
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:47,489
"I beg Thee for light"

33
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:52,249
"I'm dead"

34
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:56,969
"I beg Thee for another life"

35
00:05:57,570 --> 00:06:01,849
"Have mercy on me now"

36
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:06,049
"I've endured enough misery"

37
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:10,929
"Now that a sin is committed..."

38
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:15,249
"stop another
from being committed"

39
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:19,969
"The soul is destroyed..."

40
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:24,849
"and the heart is ruined"

41
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:29,729
"Now that a sin is committed..."

42
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:33,849
"stop another
from being committed"

43
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:55,249
In a dark cell,
few good moments...

44
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:58,449
of the past
is the only hope of survival.

45
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:01,729
And a man can live
reminiscing these moments.

46
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:05,729
Time brings about
many changes in a person.

47
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:10,249
Those were very strange days
when I first met Nina.

48
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:14,889
Bidding farewell to my heart,
we went to Kashmir for a holiday.

49
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:58,889
"The heart that you clap
your eyes on..."

50
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,649
"is a goner"

51
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:04,009
"Whatever happens of the killer..."

52
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:06,649
"God help the victim"

53
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:40,929
"You enliven..."

54
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:43,249
"a gathering"

55
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:45,929
"Should you leave..."

56
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:48,729
"the gathering disarrays"

57
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:01,649
"The heart that you clap
your eyes on..."

58
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:04,049
"is a goner"

59
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:06,769
"Whatever happens of the killer..."

60
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,409
"God help the victim"

61
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:43,929
"With a companion like you..."

62
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,529
"who cares for the destination?"

63
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:49,049
"I love the journey..."

64
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:51,849
"farewell to the destination"

65
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:04,609
"The heart that you clap
your eyes on..."

66
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:07,009
"is a goner"

67
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:09,729
"Whatever happens of the killer..."

68
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:12,289
"God help the victim"

69
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:43,889
"I belong to you now..."

70
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,609
"so does my boat"

71
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:49,089
"I shall never look back again"

72
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:51,809
"Goodbye to the shore"

73
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,649
"The heart that you clap
your eyes on..."

74
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:07,089
"is a goner"

75
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:09,929
"Whatever happens of the killer..."

76
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:12,449
"God help the victim"

77
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:44,249
The love story of Noorjehan and
Jehangir was defined beautifully!

78
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:49,049
And to repeat this love story
over the ages...

79
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:54,249
perhaps was the reason
why this Nishad Baug was made.

80
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:58,049
The lovers can come here...

81
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:01,889
and kindle themselves
in fire of their love!

82
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:07,369
I have heard that
the flame burns the moth...

83
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:10,489
but today I cannot understand...

84
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:14,609
if the flame is burning
or is it the moth?

85
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:20,009
If possible, try to understand
who is burning whom?

86
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:26,249
I am not that fortunate that
the flame will burn me...

87
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:31,249
every leaf of this garden
can narrate my love story.

88
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:40,049
Do you know that the Taj Mahal
houses two lifeless bodies of...

89
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:42,449
Shahjahan and Mumtaz Mahal.

90
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:48,569
But you can find their spirit roaming
till date, in the Shalimar Gardens.

91
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:55,969
Someone asked them their names
and their whereabouts.

92
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:59,049
And what did they answer?

93
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:06,249
They answered "The ones who are
mortal go to God after death..."

94
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:10,729
"but we are lovers, we live
in the heart of our lover"

95
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:18,249
This is Chashm-E-Shahi.
Here Noorjehan asked Jehangir...

96
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:23,729
whether anybody has seen a pearl
that is half black and half white?

97
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:27,449
To which Jehangir said that
he had seen it.

98
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:31,849
Noorjehan must have asked where?
- Yes.

99
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:35,009
And Jehangir answered that...

100
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:40,249
the tears from the eyes
of a beautiful maiden...

101
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:45,249
which is formed while
she is lining it with kohl.

102
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:48,249
What reply did Noorjehan give?

103
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:53,449
Noorjehan kissed Jehangir.
Can I come close to you?

104
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:55,649
O God, please tell Nina
to belong to me!

105
00:14:57,250 --> 00:15:00,609
O God! Please tell Anil that
I wish to belong to him forever!

106
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:05,249
O God! We hope that you will
shower your blessings on us!

107
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:10,089
My dear, come close to me.

108
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:14,489
Please!... What did you say?

109
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:21,529
Think what this breeze...

110
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:24,889
and this scenic beauty tell us...

111
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:29,249
two young hearts kindled with love
are apart from each other?

112
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:32,769
Both are being consumed
in the fervor of love!

113
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:35,249
Come closer!

114
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:40,219
"Look at the breeze
and the lovely sights"

115
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:43,069
"My beauty pales before theirs"

116
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:47,949
"My beauty is just an illusion"

117
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:51,189
"Don't fall for it"

118
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:17,789
My darling...

119
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:20,549
my sweetheart...

120
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:27,269
Let us flow with
the gentle tide of words...

121
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:30,629
let our breath get intense...

122
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:34,909
let us whisper sweet nothings
to each other!

123
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:39,229
Come closer to me!

124
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:44,029
The mingling of our breath...

125
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:47,549
will light up our lives!

126
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:51,789
And our love will bloom, isn't it?

127
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:57,599
"The fragrance of the breath
and the seducing words..."

128
00:17:57,850 --> 00:18:01,049
"are just conspiracies
of the senses"

129
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:05,969
"This shower of poetry
and the melodramatic music..."

130
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:09,649
"will pass with the night"

131
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:33,299
This silence and
middle of the night...

132
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:38,209
when the moon is staring
at us with sleepy eyes...

133
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:44,749
then why shouldn't we go ahead?

134
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:49,489
Let us walk towards the horizon...

135
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:52,799
let us sleep
in each others arms...

136
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,649
and let some angel find us
in the wee hours of morning....

137
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:01,889
seeing our cold corpses...

138
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:05,369
he showers us with the dew drops...

139
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:09,209
and cover our body with it.

140
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:14,289
"In the journey of love,
this is my first step"

141
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:18,049
"I shall go with you
wherever you take me"

142
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:22,549
"It's an unknown path for me,
and I don't know my destination"

143
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:25,989
"I'm oblivious,
lead me"

144
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:30,749
"I'm oblivious, lead me"

145
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:50,029
Your father has come to meet you.

146
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:39,749
Whenever I committed any sin,
I have punished myself severely.

147
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:45,349
But I never deterred
from the path of truth.

148
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:51,749
The religion thrives on truth,
law thrives on justice...

149
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:56,949
but today, a father needs his son!

150
00:20:57,670 --> 00:20:59,669
But father, I did not
commit the murder.

151
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:06,469
That night around 10 p.m.,
when I left the house in anger...

152
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:10,109
it was raining and
thundering very heavily.

153
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:33,309
I've told you many times not to
interfere in my personal matters.

154
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:35,429
I don't like it.

155
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:39,109
Ashok, do you think that
I am a statue?

156
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:44,949
I should listen to all your good and
bad things without uttering a word?

157
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:48,429
Will you always treat me like this?

158
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:53,349
If you are destined for this treatment
then what can I do?

159
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:57,469
It doesn't matter,
who treats you like this!

160
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:02,909
You had promised to marry me.

161
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:10,149
People like me consider it very bad
to keep up to promises and loyalty.

162
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,549
Its considered very inauspicious.

163
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:16,949
I wonder which ill fated moment
was it when you met Nina.

164
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:21,149
That was a very fortunate moment.
- Aren't you ashamed?

165
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:26,029
Should you behave like this after
ruining the life of a decent girl?

166
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:29,229
I don't behave like this
at all with decent girls!

167
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:32,749
But I don't consider those girls
decent, who before marriage...

168
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:36,709
Let go!

169
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:41,909
A wounded tigress
is very dangerous, Ashok!

170
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:46,749
You cannot escape her wrath!

171
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:50,389
I know of many tricks, Asha.

172
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:54,389
Your threats will not work on me!

173
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:58,629
I will surely take my revenge!
- Please go ahead.

174
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:14,429
You must have come to meet Mrs Sahni.
But Nina is not here!

175
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:17,949
Where is Ashok?
- He is drinking in his bedroom.

176
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:20,349
And he is remembering Nina.

177
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:43,189
Anil, you go to the police station
immediately, I'll inform your father!

178
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:47,549
And don't give any statement until
your father reaches with a lawyer.

179
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:49,749
Okay, go now!

180
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:54,549
There is nothing to worry, Anil.

181
00:25:54,910 --> 00:25:59,549
I've engaged Mr B.K. Mukherjee,
the leading lawyer in India...

182
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:01,749
you tell him the truth.

183
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:36,989
Anil, I will never consider Nina
as my daughter-in-law...

184
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:41,749
but from today, she will live
in my house as my daughter!

185
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:53,989
Daddy! How are you, daddy?

186
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:58,989
It's been so long since
you've come home.

187
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:01,749
Please tell us,
when will you come home?

188
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:11,589
Mr Anil Kumar Sahni,
the charges against you are...

189
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:15,749
that, in Mumbai,
on the 14th of November,...

190
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:20,469
you killed Mr Ashok Srivastav
in his flat at 10 p.m.

191
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:23,309
Do you accept you are guilty or not?

192
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:26,269
I am not guilty!

193
00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:31,069
No criminal accepts
that he has done the crime.

194
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:36,309
Your Honour and the most honourable
members of the jury...

195
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:42,149
I request you that
after hearing this case...

196
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:47,869
you give your valued opinion
that the accused is guilty or not.

197
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:54,429
I request the honourable members
of the jury to hear this case...

198
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:56,389
and give a verdict.

199
00:27:56,500 --> 00:28:00,389
I would like to say that
murders are of 2 types.

200
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:04,909
One, as per the situation, which
the killer does when provoked...

201
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:09,469
the sentence for this
is not for many years.

202
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:12,349
And the other is premeditated.

203
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:15,149
That means, committing
a murder with a proper planning.

204
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:17,749
And the killer gets
a death penalty for this crime.

205
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:25,349
Members of the jury...

206
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:29,589
I represent this case
as the prosecution lawyer...

207
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:31,949
and will fight the case
against the accused.

208
00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:35,229
And my honourable friend,
Mr Mukherjee...

209
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:38,749
who has been specially called
from Calcutta for this case...

210
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:44,149
and he is even known for
releasing the criminals...

211
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:47,989
will fight the case for the accused
as his defense lawyer.

212
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:55,229
My friend and I share
a very long and old association...

213
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,549
he tries his best to kill people
and I save them!

214
00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:02,629
Irrespective if the accused is a
criminal or not, you will save him!

215
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:06,269
Irrespective if the accused is
innocent, you'll surely sentence him!

216
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:12,229
I beg your pardon.

217
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:19,549
Honorable members of the jury,
this is a case of murder.

218
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:23,149
The occurrence is
very clear and simple.

219
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:28,549
With the occurrence one thing is
proved, the murder surely took place.

220
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:30,749
And Anil committed this murder.

221
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:35,029
Anil Sahni is a pilot
of a high grade.

222
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:41,109
He has also represented India in the
hockey matches at international levels

223
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:45,789
He was victimized by the
licentious nature of his wife...

224
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:51,349
and was provoked to kill
his friend, Ashok Srivastav.

225
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:57,989
Anil went to Ashok's flat at
Carmichael Road at 10 p.m.

226
00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:01,589
And few minutes later, there were
gun shots heard from that place.

227
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:07,029
And Ashok died!

228
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:13,229
And the story of revenge and
vengeance which has been repeating...

229
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:15,749
from the times of Adam and Eve,
was repeated once again!

230
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:21,149
I would like to present few witnesses.
First witness is Kewal Kapoor...

231
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:24,299
from whose house
the revolver was stolen.

232
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:29,549
Mr Kewal Kapoor, the friend of
the accused, Anil Sahni.

233
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:34,869
Since how many years
do you know the accused?

234
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,509
As far as my memory is concerned...

235
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:40,509
my mother used to say that
we were born on the same day.

236
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:46,149
It was during Diwali, he was born
bravely and I came out with fright!

237
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:50,909
I asked you since how long
do you know Anil Sahni?

238
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,799
I did say that we were born
together, we played together...

239
00:30:54,990 --> 00:30:57,389
we went to college at the same time
and took up the job together.

240
00:30:57,710 --> 00:31:01,799
He was brave, he became a pilot, I
was a coward, I became an assistant.

241
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:06,649
What do you know of the relations
between Ashok and Anil Sahni's wife?

242
00:31:07,610 --> 00:31:09,609
We all frequented Ashok's house.

243
00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:12,529
We met almost every evening
in the club or at his house.

244
00:31:13,090 --> 00:31:18,409
Did the accused ever speak to you about
his wife and Ashok's relationship?

245
00:31:18,970 --> 00:31:21,089
You really are strange!
Excuse me...

246
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:24,889
but if my wife or your wife
had relations with late Ashok...

247
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:27,249
then would we publicize it
amongst our other friends?

248
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:30,249
Then what would we do?
- We would drown with shame!

249
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:33,089
And if that was no solution then?

250
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:35,449
Then we would do the same as Anil!

251
00:31:37,050 --> 00:31:39,969
In the court, a witness is asked for
his statement, not for his opinion.

252
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:48,569
Okay tell us what transpired on
the night of 14th November?

253
00:31:49,370 --> 00:31:52,929
On night of 14th November, 11 p.m.,
I was dancing in Hotel Natraj.

254
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:56,489
Anil came to me, he was
very scared and he took me out.

255
00:31:57,050 --> 00:31:58,929
He said that he was perhaps dead.

256
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:02,049
When I asked him who he said
that the scoundrel Ashok was dead.

257
00:32:02,410 --> 00:32:04,929
What else did Anil say?
- He said that...

258
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:07,969
in his nervousness, he left
my revolver at his place.

259
00:32:08,290 --> 00:32:11,849
When I was surprised he told me that
he had taken it from my house.

260
00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:15,809
What were you doing
when he took your revolver?

261
00:32:17,050 --> 00:32:18,809
I was exercising at that time.

262
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:23,449
That means Anil stole your revolver?

263
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:26,449
Yes, he stole my revolver.

264
00:32:33,090 --> 00:32:35,489
Where did you keep your revolver?

265
00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:38,769
There is a life size picture
of Lord Hanuman in my room...

266
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:41,249
I used to hide
my revolver behind that.

267
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:46,649
Behind Lord Hanuman's picture?
- Yes, why is it a sin to do that?

268
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:50,969
I guess you are a devotee of Hanuman?
- Yes, ask me why?

269
00:32:51,890 --> 00:32:53,969
Why?
- After Lord Ram, only Hanuman had...

270
00:32:54,290 --> 00:32:58,529
the power to destroy Ravan. I think
He can save me from any grave problems

271
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:03,649
Please tell me, when Lord Hanuman
shot at Ravan...

272
00:33:04,050 --> 00:33:05,969
What are you saying?

273
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:09,049
There were no bullets then, they used
bow and arrows and swords.

274
00:33:09,410 --> 00:33:11,929
Then as per current laws,
don't you know that...

275
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:16,729
you must keep a gun in a safe place
and not hide it behind a picture?

276
00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:21,529
I felt that there was no better safe
place than Lord Hanuman's picture.

277
00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:24,929
Because, I have never seen anyone with
the same sense of duty as Hanuman.

278
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:28,169
You can read the Ramayan.
- I will surely read it.

279
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:31,729
But when you had entrusted the duty
of the revolver to Lord Hanuman...

280
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:35,169
then what was the fear, do you
exercise to increase your energy?

281
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:39,929
Yes, if you read Ramayan you'll know
Hanuman was the master of exercises!

282
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:42,649
And there is a picture of
Lord Hanuman in all wrestling arenas.

283
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:48,609
And all the wrestlers exercise
in front of his picture?

284
00:33:48,970 --> 00:33:52,049
Yes, they even scream "Hail
Lord Hanuman, make the enemy weak!"

285
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:56,169
And that day, were you exercising
in front of Hanuman's picture...

286
00:33:56,490 --> 00:34:01,009
and saying the same things?

287
00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:06,849
Yes, I was exercising and
imploring to Lord Hanuman!

288
00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:12,889
Mr Kewal Kapoor was shouting in
front of Lord Hanuman's picture...

289
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:18,929
and in front of his eyes,
Mr Anil Sahni stole his revolver...

290
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:22,249
and he didn't even see it.
Glory to Lord Hanuman!

291
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:29,129
Mr Ram Singh, the chef
of Ashok Srivastav.

292
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:35,009
Is your name Ram Singh?
- Yes, sir.

293
00:34:35,370 --> 00:34:37,929
My father's name is G. Singh and
my grandfather's name is Ajit Singh.

294
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:40,849
That's it! Where do you stay?

295
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:42,409
Nainital.

296
00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:46,529
What did you do at Mr Ashok's place?
- I cooked.

297
00:34:47,090 --> 00:34:51,449
Okay, now tell everyone what happened
on the night of 14th November?

298
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:55,929
I was in the kitchen
when my master called me.

299
00:34:56,250 --> 00:35:00,169
He told me to fry few almonds and
cashew nuts. I went inside...

300
00:35:00,690 --> 00:35:02,929
when I suddenly heard
some gun shots.

301
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:06,729
I ran towards the master's room...

302
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:09,569
I saw that my master was shot...

303
00:35:09,970 --> 00:35:12,849
and this man
was leaving the place.

304
00:35:19,210 --> 00:35:24,049
You said that every evening your
master asked you to fry nuts for him.

305
00:35:24,410 --> 00:35:27,889
Yes, sir.
- Did he have them with tea or coffee?

306
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:31,489
He never drank tea or coffee,
he always had whiskey.

307
00:35:33,010 --> 00:35:34,769
Did he drink whiskey alone?

308
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:37,449
No sir, with women.

309
00:35:38,810 --> 00:35:41,249
Ram Singh, do you know
the names of those women?

310
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:47,049
I don't know their names but
I know the food they ate.

311
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:51,889
What food did you cook for them?
- For the Christian women...

312
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:53,969
I cooked ham and turkey.

313
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:57,889
And for the Hindu women
I cooked spinach and vegetables.

314
00:35:58,250 --> 00:36:01,969
And I cooked chicken and mutton
for the Muslim girls.

315
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:07,489
Is Mr Mukherjee defending his client,
or trying to hook a cook for himself?

316
00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:13,969
You can ask the witness only
questions relating to this case.

317
00:36:14,330 --> 00:36:18,529
The relation is Ashok Srivastav's
specific interest, as Ram Singh said...

318
00:36:18,890 --> 00:36:22,249
was with women and this has a
very deep connection with this case.

319
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:31,249
When your master used to talk with
women, were you always in the kitchen?

320
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,879
Even I have a girlfriend,
she is very nice, sir.

321
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:39,119
I'm going to marry her.
- That's a very good news, Ram Singh.

322
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:43,119
If your master also felt the same
then perhaps he wouldn't be murdered.

323
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,239
Aspersions are being cast at the
deceased Ashok Srivastav's character.

324
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:57,559
Was the same girl with you the night
your boss was killed? Try to remember.

325
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:05,119
Yes sir, I remember. It was
raining and lightning heavily.

326
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:08,599
And we both were very scared.

327
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:12,399
And was someone with your master?
- Madam Asha!

328
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,759
Did you see?
- When I was taking the nuts inside...

329
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,999
they were fighting.

330
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:21,039
He asked her to get out and
she told him to shut up!

331
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,799
I got scared and
returned to my kitchen.

332
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,799
Then I and my dame had a swill each.

333
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,599
Then I pushed her out
through the back door.

334
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:34,479
After that?
- After that I heard the gun shots.

335
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:41,999
You just said that there was
thundering and lightning...

336
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:47,119
so the noise that you heard was it
the gun shot or the lightning?

337
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,319
There was thundering but
I did hear the gun shots too!

338
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,959
But how could you hear
the gun shots amidst this noise?

339
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:59,239
I just heard it.
- Perhaps, by then...

340
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,759
the lightning and thundering stopped?

341
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:03,559
Yes, sir.

342
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:06,159
So that you could hear
the gun shots clearly?

343
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,399
Yes, sir... no, sir!

344
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,399
It must have been
a coincidence, sir.

345
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,719
Very good. A coincidence.

346
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:21,239
Your Honour, members of the jury,
it was a coincidence!

347
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,639
Mr Ali Khan, all this
was a coincidence!

348
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,279
Ms Asha.

349
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:31,739
Where were you on
the night of murder, Ms Asha?

350
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:34,339
I was in Ashok's flat.

351
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,839
What were you doing there?
- He was my fiance.

352
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,199
We were going to get married.

353
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:42,319
I used to go to his house often.
And that night too, I went there.

354
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:48,119
What happened that night?
- When I was returning from there...

355
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,399
Mr Anil entered Ashok's house
in a very angry mood.

356
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:54,239
He had a revolver in his hand
and when I asked him the reason...

357
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,999
he said that he wanted
to kill Ashok.

358
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:01,239
I tried to stop him but
he did not listen to me.

359
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:05,599
And he entered Ashok's bedroom
and closed the door.

360
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,599
After sometime,
I heard few gun shots.

361
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:11,999
The door opened and
Mr Anil ran out.

362
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:16,039
And then you went into the room
and saw Ashok's dead body?

363
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:19,279
Since there was no light
in the flat and the building...

364
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:23,399
I found Ashok dead after sometime.

365
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:27,599
And close to him was
Anil's revolver.

366
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:34,899
Ms Asha, since when do you
know Mr Ashok Srivastav?

367
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:39,599
Since 3 years.
- How did you meet him the first time?

368
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:43,799
There was a New Year eve dance
in CCI and even I had been there.

369
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,079
Ashok asked me
for a dance and I agreed.

370
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:51,279
After the dance, he gave me his card
and asked me to visit him.

371
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:54,399
And you visited him?
- Yes.

372
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,199
Because, he insisted that
I should visit him.

373
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:02,519
Ms Asha, do you go so easily
on the first invitation itself?

374
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:05,159
Of course not!
- Then how come you...

375
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,519
went to Ashok Srivastav's house?

376
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:12,079
Because I liked him a lot.
- Because, you found him rich.

377
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,199
This is wrong.
- It is true!

378
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:24,559
Asha, agreed that you did not go
there because he is rich...

379
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:28,519
but you went there because
you liked that man.

380
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:31,719
It could be possible that
he really was a good man.

381
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:36,679
But I don't know how you thought in
one meeting that he was a nice man?

382
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:39,639
God has bestowed every person
with a little sense of thinking...

383
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,999
by which he can differentiate
between good and bad.

384
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:45,279
That's exactly what I was thinking
that in 10 minutes flat...

385
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:48,479
you can analyze
a person's character...

386
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:53,399
but it's surprising that in 4 months,
you couldn't understand the woman...

387
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:57,439
who cheated you and snatched away
your fiancee from you?

388
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:01,639
That's because she was married.
And I always thought that...

389
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,079
she would never have
such intentions for another man.

390
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:10,799
Why don't you clearly say Nina Sahni
is more beautiful than you?

391
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:14,439
Beautiful? I have been
honoured Miss Mumbai.

392
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:18,639
Ashok's nature was such, he would
get enticed by any new woman.

393
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:23,319
And you, I beg your pardon,
had become quite old for him!

394
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:31,279
Agreed that she was not
better looking than you...

395
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:34,319
neither did your charm
wear off from him...

396
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:37,559
but you yet noticed that Ashok
was attracted to Nina Sahni.

397
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:41,239
Yes, they would meet clandestinely
without my knowledge.

398
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:44,599
When I couldn't bear this anymore,
I fought with Ashok.

399
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:48,799
It had a bad effect, in anger
he threatened to break the engagement.

400
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:52,759
But I did not agree.
- Why didn't you break the engagement?

401
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:55,519
What was the reason for which you
could not sever your ties with him?

402
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,839
Jealousy, greed, obsession?

403
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:02,359
No! I loved Ashok!
I did not want to leave him!

404
00:42:02,430 --> 00:42:05,559
I wanted him to belong only to me
and nobody else!

405
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:12,719
Mr Mukherjee has no right
to ask questions...

406
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:15,039
which are not related
with this case.

407
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:17,799
And to rub salt over the wounds
of a girl jilted in love!

408
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:22,439
It is a sin for me to rub salt
over someone's wounds then...

409
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:27,999
but to hang an innocent man is a
very good deed according to my friend!

410
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:31,479
Anyway Asha, as you just said...

411
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:35,999
you loved Ashok so much
that you could not leave him.

412
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:40,799
No wonder you went to his flat every
evening... I mean how was your love?

413
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:44,399
Was it platonic love,
a clean relationship or...?

414
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:50,639
My friend should be ashamed
to ask such questions.

415
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,679
I am feeling ashamed, Mr Ali Khan.

416
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:57,999
"You will feel embarrassed if
I narrate the tales of the night"

417
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:02,159
You were right, Mr Khan. Forget
whatever happened last night!

418
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:06,639
But there is one thing. Asha,
you are the last person...

419
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:09,559
who saw Ashok Srivastav
alive that night.

420
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:12,279
Can you tell me...

421
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:16,399
The last person
who saw Ashok alive...

422
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:19,199
was not me, it was Mr Anil.

423
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:26,039
I mean, you were the first woman
who saw Ashok's dead body.

424
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:31,164
No, Mr Anil was the first man
who saw Ashok's dead body.

425
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,119
You came well prepared to the court!

426
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:04,199
You don't know me very well, I am
always well prepared for anything!

427
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:07,519
Can I prepare some dinner for you?

428
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:13,799
That day is not very far
but today, I am not ready.

429
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:16,039
As you wish!

430
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:32,519
I have stated that Ashok Srivastav
was shot on his temple...

431
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,799
and he died due to that.

432
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,279
I state that the revolver had
the fingerprints of the accused.

433
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:53,959
Why did father shoot Ashok uncle?

434
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:59,999
The boys in my school say that
he loved mother.

435
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:04,519
But even I love mother
and father approves of it.

436
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:11,959
Even I love her, isn't it mother?
But father doesn't tell me anything!

437
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:17,279
How I wish I was also
a child like you both!

438
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:23,479
Raibahadur Gyanchand Sahni,
the father of the accused.

439
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:29,599
Raibahadur, is it true that this
marriage was against your wishes?

440
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:35,279
Yes, but every father is responsible
for his son's good and bad deeds.

441
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:40,239
That means, a father is trying to
hold himself responsible...

442
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:42,479
and save his son at any cost?

443
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:48,439
My dear friend, when you are trying
to hang someone's son on the noose...

444
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:52,279
then what is the problem if
the father is trying to save his son?

445
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,999
Mrs Nina Sahni,
wife of the accused.

446
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:04,359
Since how many years
are you married?

447
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:05,999
7 years.

448
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:09,079
Was it a love marriage?
- Yes.

449
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:13,179
In the last 7 years, did your husband
ever give you a reason to complain?

450
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:15,499
No.
- Did you regret leaving France...

451
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:18,899
and settling in India?
- No.

452
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:23,699
My father was an Indian
and I loved my father a lot.

453
00:46:24,340 --> 00:46:29,699
That is why I always prayed that
I should also get an Indian husband.

454
00:46:31,340 --> 00:46:34,179
Mr Sahni, since when
do you know Ashok Srivastav?

455
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:38,499
Since past one year,
Ashok was Anil's close friend.

456
00:46:39,220 --> 00:46:43,499
He knew Anil since many years and
had gone to America for business.

457
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:47,299
When he came back
around a year back, I met him.

458
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:51,259
When did you meet Ashok Srivastav
for the first time?

459
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:56,299
At Ashok's flat, next day Anil was
leaving the town for 4 months.

460
00:46:56,700 --> 00:46:58,899
And Ashok had thrown a party
in his honour.

461
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:04,899
As far as I remember, it was the
first time I had liquor in that party.

462
00:47:05,540 --> 00:47:07,539
And that too,
I was forced to do so.

463
00:47:07,940 --> 00:47:10,259
Because, along with Ashok,
Anil was also pressurizing me.

464
00:47:10,620 --> 00:47:12,619
So that his friend
should not feel offended.

465
00:47:12,860 --> 00:47:16,259
This depends on you, if possible,
go ahead and convince her.

466
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:19,699
Darling, tonight is
a very eventful night.

467
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:23,059
Tomorrow I am going for four months.
- Four months?

468
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:27,499
That means, 120 days!
I request you Mrs Sahni...

469
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:31,299
for his happiness,
I beg you to drink!

470
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:35,939
"I am fortunate that
I can share these few moments"

471
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:38,499
"For tomorrow, we do not know
where we are"

472
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:44,459
Please.

473
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:52,219
Go on... drink so much that
every sip makes Anil happy!

474
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:05,359
Ashok, please look after Nina
and the children.

475
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:10,099
You need not tell me, they won't even
realise how these 4 months passed by.

476
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:12,559
They will just fly past!

477
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,479
I consider this very unauspicious!

478
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:36,159
That someone is leaving and
his dear ones are shedding tears.

479
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:39,999
Love is in the heart,
not in the eyes.

480
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:44,279
The path of love is very fragile.

481
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,279
One has to carefully tread on it.

482
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:21,999
Now you will see one more trick.
Even an animal cannot tolerate...

483
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:25,159
injustice meted out on beauty!
Give me your hand!

484
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:34,349
The dog will come to save you
when you are in trouble!

485
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:35,499
Come...

486
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:38,559
Sit down!

487
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:31,119
"In these paths of love..."

488
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:34,959
"tread very carefully"

489
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:39,599
"What ruins your heart here..."

490
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:44,039
"is your own unruly passion"

491
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:48,359
"In these paths of love..."

492
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:52,279
"tread very carefully"

493
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:31,319
"One who walks on these paths..."

494
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:35,399
"never returns"

495
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:40,119
"If ever he returns..."

496
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:44,079
"all he brings with him
is despair"

497
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:53,199
"He shall spend the rest
of his life..."

498
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:57,199
"like someone with lost identity"

499
00:51:57,800 --> 00:52:02,039
"Such are the paths of love"

500
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:05,919
"Tread very carefully"

501
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:41,159
"What I considered..."

502
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:45,279
"was a lamp of my heart..."

503
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:49,999
"when I went up close..."

504
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:53,999
"it turned out to be
a bane to my heart"

505
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:03,159
"Should you try to be a firefly..."

506
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:07,239
"you end up getting burnt"

507
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:11,839
"In these paths of love..."

508
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:15,799
"tread very carefully"

509
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:20,319
"What ruins your heart here..."

510
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:24,719
"is your own unruly passion"

511
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:51,399
What are you doing tomorrow?
- I am going for shopping tomorrow.

512
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:53,879
Alone?
- Anil has gone out of town.

513
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:59,239
It's a sin for a woman to shop alone
and I cannot bear this sin!

514
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:01,679
I will get my car
but I have a condition.

515
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:04,999
Tell me.
- You will have to get the kids along.

516
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:18,079
Who is it?

517
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:25,399
You?
- Any doubts?

518
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,239
At this hour?
- When the night falls...

519
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:30,599
it looks even more beautiful!

520
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:37,999
Sleeping in the wee hours of morning
is considered a crime for men like me!

521
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:40,119
What do you think?

522
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:47,319
Why are you so scared? Let me light
my pipe, only then can I talk!

523
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:54,599
I came here with
some important work.

524
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:59,319
With me?
- With you?

525
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:04,439
Yes, I think it is with you.

526
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:09,599
Sometimes you tend to
forget important things.

527
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:14,359
In the morning the children insist on
some things, you apologize to them...

528
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:17,239
and I have to go through the trouble.

529
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:20,439
You had bought chocolates
for your children...

530
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:23,599
and you left them
in my car, see this!

531
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:28,999
Take this too!

532
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:33,799
I am sorry for the trouble.
- You went through the trouble.

533
00:56:33,888 --> 00:56:37,599
No, this is my good fortune.
I wish that...

534
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:42,999
I mean, I hope you'll
keep on troubling me this way!

535
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:45,199
And if you...

536
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:19,599
A small frown on your forehead
tells me that...

537
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:22,599
something is troubling you...

538
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:28,199
and you are missing your husband
who has gone abroad!

539
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:31,359
Two thoughts are
troubling me today.

540
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:35,039
Two thoughts? What are they?

541
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:38,599
One before you came into my life
and one after you left?

542
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:41,279
It's a lovely poem, I have
forgotten the first stanza.

543
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:43,599
Sir, the first stanza
goes like this...

544
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:46,999
"There have been only
two moments in my life..."

545
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:50,279
"one before you came into my life
and one after you left"

546
00:58:52,100 --> 00:58:54,779
Yes. There are many days left
for Anil to arrive back.

547
00:58:55,180 --> 00:58:58,619
Our wedding anniversary and
Anil's birthday are approaching.

548
00:58:58,940 --> 00:59:01,499
That's great, congratulations!

549
00:59:02,060 --> 00:59:04,619
Please accept my good wishes twice!

550
00:59:06,860 --> 00:59:09,539
You will experience
these good moments often.

551
00:59:10,020 --> 00:59:12,619
But perhaps, I'll never be fortunate
enough to experience this ever!

552
00:59:12,940 --> 00:59:17,459
If you permit me then please let me
organise a grand party in this honour!

553
00:59:17,860 --> 00:59:19,579
But I don't know many people around.

554
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:22,419
The sad part is that you have
yet not known me very well!

555
00:59:22,740 --> 00:59:24,539
And neither do you know yourself!

556
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:28,299
Permit me to introduce you
to thousands who know you well!

557
00:59:41,620 --> 00:59:43,699
If a man gets even one moment
of happiness in his life...

558
00:59:44,060 --> 00:59:46,059
then he feels proud of his destiny.

559
00:59:46,740 --> 00:59:51,539
But today, with great luck, two
good moments have come together...

560
00:59:51,900 --> 00:59:54,899
Anil's birthday
and your wedding anniversary!

561
00:59:59,060 --> 01:00:00,059
Please!

562
01:00:11,100 --> 01:00:14,699
After this day, this piano will
surely take pride in its good fortune.

563
01:00:15,780 --> 01:00:18,379
But I have come here
to recommend something.

564
01:00:18,940 --> 01:00:24,179
For this drink, which is dying
to meet with your lips!

565
01:00:24,860 --> 01:00:27,539
What is this, Ashok?
- Don't ask this on an auspicious day.

566
01:00:27,900 --> 01:00:29,619
It's considered as a bad omen.

567
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:37,139
I'm not offering liquor to a person
who can intoxicate with her looks!

568
01:00:38,900 --> 01:00:42,179
Trust me, I cannot be so audacious!

569
01:00:42,900 --> 01:00:43,899
Please take!

570
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:46,899
Please!

571
01:01:23,740 --> 01:01:26,379
Drink in such a way that
every sip makes Anil happy!

572
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:21,099
"Look at my life..."

573
01:02:21,740 --> 01:02:25,379
"tonight it sways in euphoria"

574
01:02:26,820 --> 01:02:30,379
"I wonder where it is taking me"

575
01:03:31,860 --> 01:03:35,459
"I'm not alone in my journey"

576
01:03:36,740 --> 01:03:40,419
"My heart is my companion"

577
01:03:41,700 --> 01:03:43,139
"I..."

578
01:03:43,740 --> 01:03:45,459
"pass by..."

579
01:03:46,100 --> 01:03:50,139
"yet not a path I find"

580
01:03:51,100 --> 01:03:55,099
"Even in dust I find light..."

581
01:03:55,980 --> 01:04:00,099
"that burn me"

582
01:04:00,940 --> 01:04:05,499
"O Life, where are you?"

583
01:05:07,140 --> 01:05:11,139
"Someone is calling me..."

584
01:05:12,100 --> 01:05:15,899
"from afar"

585
01:05:16,940 --> 01:05:20,899
"I step ahead..."

586
01:05:21,900 --> 01:05:25,739
"towards him with pride"

587
01:05:26,860 --> 01:05:30,499
"My heart is ecstatic"

588
01:05:31,900 --> 01:05:35,459
"My eyes too have lit up"

589
01:05:36,780 --> 01:05:40,699
"Though, I don't see
a lamp anywhere"

590
01:06:42,620 --> 01:06:46,379
"My path is strewn with roses"

591
01:06:47,580 --> 01:06:51,299
"Stars twinkle before my eyes"

592
01:06:52,100 --> 01:06:56,259
"Do not call me now..."

593
01:06:57,020 --> 01:07:00,979
"I'm drowning in passion"

594
01:07:02,100 --> 01:07:06,299
"I'm not in my senses"

595
01:07:06,940 --> 01:07:10,899
"Stunned, I ask myself..."

596
01:07:11,940 --> 01:07:15,899
"where I am headed"

597
01:07:21,780 --> 01:07:25,619
"Look at my life..."

598
01:07:26,780 --> 01:07:30,459
"tonight it sways in euphoria"

599
01:07:31,660 --> 01:07:35,379
"I wonder where it is taking me"

600
01:08:51,700 --> 01:08:52,999
Mother.

601
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:00,999
Mother.

602
01:09:03,383 --> 01:09:05,699
Mother.

603
01:09:10,700 --> 01:09:14,299
Mother.

604
01:09:52,899 --> 01:09:53,998
Postman,
Madam.

605
01:10:07,160 --> 01:10:10,599
"Nina, this night is the most
beautiful night of our lives."

606
01:10:12,240 --> 01:10:13,999
"I wish I was with you..."

607
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:19,399
"but you aren't away from me,
you live in my heart!"

608
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:26,519
That night was the most
horrible night of my life!

609
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:30,399
Who could be a better
trust worthy friend than Ashok?

610
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:36,679
But I didn't know that nobody was
worth trusting in this dishonest world

611
01:10:37,040 --> 01:10:42,199
You mean that one shouldn't trust
a conniving man like Ashok Srivastav?

612
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:52,919
For how many years
did you live in Paris?

613
01:10:53,480 --> 01:10:56,759
For 20 years, I was
born and brought up there.

614
01:10:57,400 --> 01:10:59,279
Obviously you completed
your education there.

615
01:10:59,560 --> 01:11:03,399
Yes.
- Mrs Sahni, is it true that...

616
01:11:03,720 --> 01:11:05,919
right from school days
in Paris...

617
01:11:06,240 --> 01:11:09,039
the girls start having affairs and
openly display it in public places?

618
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:13,199
It is a special place, only
the affluent visit the clubs there...

619
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:16,879
or the tourist from other countries
frequent that place.

620
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:19,079
Ordinary people don't go there.

621
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:25,079
So it's true that their lifestyle
is different from ours?

622
01:11:25,640 --> 01:11:27,959
Yes, and it should be that way.

623
01:11:28,360 --> 01:11:29,599
Sure.

624
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:35,639
Out there a woman can smoke
and drink with a strange man.

625
01:11:36,780 --> 01:11:41,979
And if she's bored with her husband,
she can enjoy herself with a stranger.

626
01:11:42,700 --> 01:11:45,899
And if she gets bored even with that
then she can divorce her husband.

627
01:11:46,220 --> 01:11:48,779
Such things are not considered
immoral there.

628
01:11:49,100 --> 01:11:54,859
What I mean to say is they don't have
as many restrictions as us. Right?

629
01:11:55,220 --> 01:11:58,499
Yes, there is lot of difference
in the lifestyles of both the places.

630
01:11:58,940 --> 01:12:00,739
Which lifestyle do you like?

631
01:12:04,100 --> 01:12:08,099
You perhaps didn't hear, Mrs Sahni,
I asked which lifestyle do you like?

632
01:12:10,220 --> 01:12:15,099
Your silence says that the woman
who spent 20 years of her life...

633
01:12:15,420 --> 01:12:17,259
in the romantic evenings of Paris...

634
01:12:17,580 --> 01:12:22,139
then how can she lead a happy life
with an Indian husband?

635
01:12:22,980 --> 01:12:26,259
In your statement you have said
that in Anil's absence...

636
01:12:26,980 --> 01:12:30,099
you used to accompany Ashok
to clubs and dances.

637
01:12:31,100 --> 01:12:33,099
I am very sure that...

638
01:12:34,300 --> 01:12:37,099
in the matter of drinking too,
you used to give him company.

639
01:12:38,260 --> 01:12:41,579
Mrs Sahni said in her statement that
she had liquor for the first time.

640
01:12:41,940 --> 01:12:43,819
And that too, because she was
forced by Ashok Srivastav.

641
01:12:44,100 --> 01:12:49,099
Mr Mukherjee, you cannot object to the
questions connected with this case.

642
01:12:53,860 --> 01:12:56,739
Mrs Sahni, are you
trying to say that...

643
01:12:57,100 --> 01:13:00,939
at the wedding anniversary party
that was hosted in your house...

644
01:13:01,340 --> 01:13:04,499
inspite of knowing that
you don't drink...

645
01:13:04,900 --> 01:13:06,739
did Ashok force you to drink?

646
01:13:07,180 --> 01:13:10,739
Yes.
- You mean, he tied you with a rope...

647
01:13:11,100 --> 01:13:14,299
or he compelled you in some other way,
he forcibly opened your mouth...

648
01:13:14,660 --> 01:13:16,579
and pushed it down your throat?

649
01:13:16,900 --> 01:13:19,499
I did not say that.
- Then what do you mean by force?

650
01:13:19,900 --> 01:13:21,699
I mean, I was compelled to drink.

651
01:13:22,740 --> 01:13:25,779
Mrs Sahni, the glass
from which you had the liquor...

652
01:13:26,140 --> 01:13:28,539
whose glass was it?
- Mine!

653
01:13:28,940 --> 01:13:31,739
And whose hands took the glass
to your lips?

654
01:13:32,100 --> 01:13:32,819
Mine!

655
01:13:33,100 --> 01:13:35,899
And who put the liquor
down your throat?

656
01:13:36,260 --> 01:13:38,739
I did!
- Then how was it forced on you?

657
01:13:39,100 --> 01:13:41,859
I mean, he insisted that I drink.

658
01:13:43,100 --> 01:13:47,099
So you think that force and
insisting mean the same?

659
01:13:48,100 --> 01:13:51,459
Can Mr Mukherjee tell me if
these two words mean the same?

660
01:13:51,860 --> 01:13:57,579
You perhaps forget that you are
cross examining her, not me.

661
01:13:59,900 --> 01:14:04,099
If you really want to know then,
I am at your service after the court.

662
01:14:06,260 --> 01:14:08,939
I am warning you both that this is
court and not a public gathering.

663
01:14:16,020 --> 01:14:17,919
Do you consider
drinking alcohol bad?

664
01:14:18,100 --> 01:14:20,779
I think it is very bad
for a woman to drink.

665
01:14:21,500 --> 01:14:23,939
Despite considering alcohol bad...

666
01:14:24,380 --> 01:14:27,859
you had it because Ashok forced
and insisted you to have it.

667
01:14:28,220 --> 01:14:32,539
Yes.
- When on his forcing...

668
01:14:32,940 --> 01:14:36,419
you could do one bad deed, then...?
- What are you trying to say?

669
01:14:36,820 --> 01:14:42,339
I am trying to say that
you encouraged Ashok!

670
01:14:42,740 --> 01:14:47,299
This is a lie! If this was the case
then why would I tell Anil about it?

671
01:14:47,780 --> 01:14:51,819
Because you had
no other alternative.

672
01:14:53,100 --> 01:14:59,099
Anil came back suddenly and you
knew that he had learnt everything...

673
01:14:59,980 --> 01:15:04,099
you created a fictitious story
of your innocence...

674
01:15:04,980 --> 01:15:08,539
you held that man responsible
for all your sins...

675
01:15:08,940 --> 01:15:11,199
whom you called a conspirator!

676
01:15:11,260 --> 01:15:14,579
This is a lie,
I told Anil the truth.

677
01:15:14,980 --> 01:15:16,579
Ashok cheated me!

678
01:15:16,860 --> 01:15:17,859
Could be.

679
01:15:18,300 --> 01:15:22,579
Mrs Sahni, you knew Ashok
since four months.

680
01:15:24,340 --> 01:15:31,299
Isn't it right that you got a chance
to get close to him in this period?

681
01:15:32,820 --> 01:15:35,859
Mrs Sahni, you are an educated
and an intelligent lady...

682
01:15:36,220 --> 01:15:41,499
are you trying to tell the jury that
for 4 months, he forced you and...

683
01:15:42,020 --> 01:15:44,099
you did not realise his intentions?

684
01:15:45,900 --> 01:15:50,619
Mrs Sahni, your lover is dead and
everything is out in open now.

685
01:15:51,900 --> 01:15:58,139
You are trying to prove
that you are a loyal wife...

686
01:15:59,980 --> 01:16:04,299
because there's nobody else besides
your husband to look forward to.

687
01:16:06,100 --> 01:16:09,459
My dear friend is forgetting that
the court is a place of high regard...

688
01:16:09,860 --> 01:16:13,099
and he shouldn't talk such cheap
things and show his true colours.

689
01:16:19,900 --> 01:16:21,659
What is left to prove anyway?

690
01:16:31,780 --> 01:16:34,699
Since how many years
have you been married?

691
01:16:35,260 --> 01:16:38,619
Seven years.
- And how was your domestic life...

692
01:16:38,940 --> 01:16:40,899
in these seven years?

693
01:16:41,980 --> 01:16:45,979
The same as any other decent man.
I was happy with life.

694
01:16:48,100 --> 01:16:50,219
What do you feel
about women's liberation?

695
01:16:51,100 --> 01:16:55,779
I feel that a man and a woman
should have equal freedom.

696
01:16:56,860 --> 01:16:59,099
But that doesn't mean that we take
undue advantage of that freedom.

697
01:17:00,100 --> 01:17:03,779
Sometimes, outdated thoughts
can make life difficult.

698
01:17:04,860 --> 01:17:08,379
And sometimes, extra freedom
can also create complications.

699
01:17:08,980 --> 01:17:11,099
Mr Sahni, does your wife
also share the same views?

700
01:17:11,980 --> 01:17:14,499
Yes. When I met her
for the first time...

701
01:17:15,180 --> 01:17:17,099
and studied her nature...

702
01:17:18,100 --> 01:17:20,099
I learnt that we shared
a lot in common.

703
01:17:23,860 --> 01:17:27,459
The accused's ideas
about his wife are wrong.

704
01:17:28,100 --> 01:17:33,099
Because, she a very liberated woman
who is quite ahead of times.

705
01:17:33,900 --> 01:17:36,819
Like the women in the west.

706
01:17:41,180 --> 01:17:44,019
Mr Khan, how many western girls
have you been in love with?

707
01:17:44,340 --> 01:17:47,259
Mr Mukherjee, you cannot
object such questions.

708
01:17:48,980 --> 01:17:53,499
Mr Mukherjee, to make an omelette,
it is necessary to see that...

709
01:17:53,900 --> 01:17:56,779
whether the egg is good or not.
Nobody looks at the hen.

710
01:17:57,100 --> 01:17:59,499
I don't know what you do
in Bengal...

711
01:17:59,820 --> 01:18:03,259
but to know a woman
it's not necessary to love her.

712
01:18:11,940 --> 01:18:16,739
In this period of 7 years, did you
notice any change in your wife?

713
01:18:17,740 --> 01:18:19,739
Only this time when
I returned back from Europe.

714
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:23,039
Father is back!

715
01:18:23,820 --> 01:18:25,099
Father is back!

716
01:18:33,140 --> 01:18:35,699
I had everything there,
only you were missing.

717
01:18:44,100 --> 01:18:45,499
Look at this.

718
01:18:47,100 --> 01:18:50,339
Father, there are two men
pursuing one woman?

719
01:18:50,700 --> 01:18:52,939
Yes, child.
- Then with whom will she dance?

720
01:18:53,300 --> 01:18:56,099
The one she likes.
- Yes, the one whom she likes.

721
01:18:58,020 --> 01:19:00,499
This is your pistol?
- Is it a real one, father?

722
01:19:00,860 --> 01:19:02,819
Absolutely real.
- Then on whom shall I use it?

723
01:19:03,100 --> 01:19:05,739
You will not find a better target
than me, come on shoot me.

724
01:19:06,180 --> 01:19:09,099
On you?
- Pawan is scared.

725
01:19:09,660 --> 01:19:11,579
I am not scared.

726
01:19:22,140 --> 01:19:25,619
All my desires
have been fulfilled...

727
01:19:26,100 --> 01:19:29,459
the only desire is that
I should die at your feet.

728
01:19:34,300 --> 01:19:36,619
There was a time when
someone else killed me,...

729
01:19:37,100 --> 01:19:39,339
today the children are repeating
the same performance.

730
01:19:42,460 --> 01:19:44,219
Why are you looking so sad?

731
01:19:47,980 --> 01:19:52,739
If someone has cast an evil eye then
I shall ward off the evil spell.

732
01:19:55,100 --> 01:20:00,219
If someone has smiled at you
then I shall snatch off his smiles.

733
01:20:02,940 --> 01:20:09,659
I've got you a precious gift which
my love will express after 300 years.

734
01:20:16,100 --> 01:20:17,699
Did my queen like it?

735
01:20:22,980 --> 01:20:24,659
My dear, I want an answer.

736
01:20:27,220 --> 01:20:31,739
I'm pleased, my queen but you cannot
be the queen to the whole world.

737
01:20:32,860 --> 01:20:36,379
I swear upon this beautiful Taj,
if anyone dares to look at you...

738
01:20:36,780 --> 01:20:38,779
then either one of us
shall be alive.

739
01:20:59,820 --> 01:21:02,099
You don't seem to be
in a good mood today.

740
01:21:05,700 --> 01:21:10,259
How are you feeling?
- You think of fooling all the time.

741
01:21:11,100 --> 01:21:14,419
I'm speaking to you with respect and
you are forgetting the formalities?

742
01:21:14,820 --> 01:21:16,739
Okay, I deserve that.

743
01:21:17,100 --> 01:21:19,579
Anil, you are acting
like a child today.

744
01:21:26,460 --> 01:21:30,819
Remember Nina, you always said that
there were 3 children in our house.

745
01:21:32,180 --> 01:21:33,579
Keep quiet...

746
01:21:35,100 --> 01:21:37,459
How can a devotee be quiet
in front of his Goddess?

747
01:21:38,140 --> 01:21:41,459
Today is my day.

748
01:21:41,860 --> 01:21:44,339
Today, I will kill myself
with my own hands.

749
01:21:44,660 --> 01:21:46,739
Today, I shall adorn my Goddess
with my own hands.

750
01:21:58,100 --> 01:22:02,099
Anil, you go outside,
I will dress up and come.

751
01:22:08,020 --> 01:22:09,699
I can let you get away with murder.

752
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:03,799
At the sight of you...

753
01:23:03,900 --> 01:23:07,779
I forget everything but you

754
01:23:08,100 --> 01:23:11,739
I don't know...

755
01:23:11,850 --> 01:23:16,299
if I'm alive or dead

756
01:23:21,980 --> 01:23:25,699
Darling, this telephone is like
my rival. Let's go out somewhere.

757
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,319
Go and start the car,
I'll get the phone.

758
01:23:47,240 --> 01:23:48,879
Shall I shoot you?

759
01:23:49,440 --> 01:23:54,799
Mother, Pawan shot at me.
I am dead now, goodbye.

760
01:23:55,440 --> 01:23:58,399
Mother, look at my house
before you leave.

761
01:26:29,400 --> 01:26:32,079
Your table is there.
- I think you are looking...

762
01:26:32,400 --> 01:26:36,199
for someone else, Jameel.
- I am sorry, sir.

763
01:26:36,560 --> 01:26:39,439
I must have made a mistake.
You are not the same one.

764
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:43,079
But Nina, how
do you know his name?

765
01:26:43,400 --> 01:26:45,279
I am the famous poet,
Jameel Lucknowi.

766
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:47,639
I work as a waiter in the day
and write poetry in the night.

767
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,199
Madam had attended
one of my concerts.

768
01:26:51,240 --> 01:26:54,639
I've written a famous poem which is
almost similar as Mirza Ghalib's...

769
01:26:55,440 --> 01:26:57,439
but it gained a lot of recognition.
It goes as...

770
01:26:57,760 --> 01:26:59,799
"This ignorance
is not accidental, Jameel..."

771
01:27:00,160 --> 01:27:02,159
"there is surely something
that is kept under wraps"

772
01:29:35,360 --> 01:29:37,479
How peacefully
they both are sleeping.

773
01:29:40,240 --> 01:29:41,959
They are oblivious of the world...

774
01:29:43,160 --> 01:29:45,399
but once they grow up,
they will understand everything.

775
01:29:46,400 --> 01:29:49,799
At that time, what will I tell them,
what will the world tell them?

776
01:29:52,400 --> 01:29:54,079
And what will they
understand themselves?

777
01:29:54,400 --> 01:29:56,839
Anil, I wish to tell you something.

778
01:29:57,240 --> 01:30:01,999
Don't tell me, Nina. Probably,
I won't be able to bear it.

779
01:30:04,240 --> 01:30:09,639
I shudder with the thought when
I look at your scared expression...

780
01:30:10,120 --> 01:30:14,199
which is in dilemma and is trying
to hide and also tell me everything.

781
01:30:15,400 --> 01:30:20,099
I feel that there is
darkness around me.

782
01:30:21,160 --> 01:30:27,149
And I am standing at the edge
of a deserted cliff.

783
01:30:27,760 --> 01:30:31,559
Anil, please save me,
please don't let me fall.

784
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:33,399
Save me!

785
01:30:41,400 --> 01:30:44,599
Nina, you are fortunate
that you can at least cry.

786
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:49,079
Look at me, the tears have been
snatched from my eyes...

787
01:30:50,440 --> 01:30:52,119
and also the smile from my lips.

788
01:30:52,400 --> 01:30:55,759
Promise me that you will never
leave me alone now.

789
01:30:59,400 --> 01:31:01,399
I did not stay without you
even for a moment.

790
01:31:06,240 --> 01:31:09,399
Every moment, you were with me.

791
01:31:11,360 --> 01:31:13,959
Whenever I looked at the blue
clouds while flying the plane...

792
01:31:15,400 --> 01:31:18,079
I could see only you.

793
01:31:19,240 --> 01:31:22,639
Listen, Nina. One day,
a terrible storm hit...

794
01:31:23,120 --> 01:31:28,039
but I told the storm that
nobody can deter me...

795
01:31:29,400 --> 01:31:31,599
because, my Nina
would be waiting for me.

796
01:31:32,080 --> 01:31:33,759
Listen to me, Anil.

797
01:31:34,080 --> 01:31:36,599
Nina, I shudder at the thought that
you are trying to tell me something.

798
01:31:41,400 --> 01:31:45,399
Please tell me that you don't
want to tell me anything.

799
01:31:46,400 --> 01:31:49,119
Anil, I will not be able to sleep
peacefully without telling you.

800
01:31:50,240 --> 01:31:52,559
And I will not be able
to live if I hear it.

801
01:31:55,400 --> 01:31:58,039
I plead to you for one night.

802
01:32:01,400 --> 01:32:04,399
This may perhaps, be the last night
of my good fortune.

803
01:32:07,600 --> 01:32:10,399
Please go to sleep, Nina.

804
01:34:31,580 --> 01:34:35,539
"Your tresses swayed..."

805
01:34:37,100 --> 01:34:41,379
"and made my life"

806
01:34:43,340 --> 01:34:47,259
"Worth watching..."

807
01:34:49,300 --> 01:34:54,299
"was the picture of love
that came through"

808
01:34:57,400 --> 01:35:00,959
"Every time the evening shadows..."

809
01:35:02,560 --> 01:35:07,079
"grew cooler..."

810
01:35:08,840 --> 01:35:13,199
"the glow on your face..."

811
01:35:14,400 --> 01:35:18,119
"would keep me warm"

812
01:35:20,560 --> 01:35:23,919
"Whenever bad times..."

813
01:35:24,600 --> 01:35:28,999
"struck me..."

814
01:35:31,720 --> 01:35:37,199
"those sparkling eyes..."

815
01:35:38,600 --> 01:35:42,599
"would pull me together"

816
01:35:45,520 --> 01:35:48,599
"Should someone ask me..."

817
01:35:49,520 --> 01:35:52,239
"what you mean to me..."

818
01:35:53,560 --> 01:35:55,399
"I'd say, you are..."

819
01:35:56,360 --> 01:36:00,759
"a beautiful prayer of my love"

820
01:36:48,600 --> 01:36:51,919
"What my heart..."

821
01:36:52,600 --> 01:36:55,839
"prayed for..."

822
01:36:56,440 --> 01:37:00,119
"you are the first blessing..."

823
01:37:00,560 --> 01:37:03,599
"of love I received"

824
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:07,359
"Should someone ask me..."

825
01:37:08,280 --> 01:37:11,079
"what you mean to me..."

826
01:37:27,600 --> 01:37:29,599
"Even music..."

827
01:37:30,560 --> 01:37:34,479
"envies you"

828
01:37:35,480 --> 01:37:38,599
"Such is your melody
that resonates..."

829
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:42,599
"in the valleys of my heart"

830
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:46,319
"Should someone ask me..."

831
01:37:46,720 --> 01:37:49,759
"what you mean to me..."

832
01:38:13,800 --> 01:38:17,199
"If my life..."

833
01:38:17,800 --> 01:38:20,959
"is a garden in bloom..."

834
01:38:21,600 --> 01:38:23,799
"my love..."

835
01:38:24,480 --> 01:38:28,399
"you are the easterly breeze"

836
01:38:29,560 --> 01:38:32,599
"Should someone ask me..."

837
01:38:33,440 --> 01:38:36,159
"what you mean to me..."

838
01:38:37,280 --> 01:38:39,279
"I'd say, you are..."

839
01:38:39,600 --> 01:38:44,199
"a beautiful prayer of my love"

840
01:39:08,480 --> 01:39:13,399
"Why is today my life
in a mess?"

841
01:39:16,640 --> 01:39:19,879
"I've seen..."

842
01:39:20,360 --> 01:39:23,599
"many a Taj Mahal break"

843
01:39:25,600 --> 01:39:29,039
"I never imagined..."

844
01:39:29,440 --> 01:39:31,799
"the breeze would kick up a storm"

845
01:39:33,360 --> 01:39:36,239
"I never imagined..."

846
01:39:36,600 --> 01:39:39,399
"her tresses would turn
into serpents"

847
01:39:42,440 --> 01:39:47,599
"Your face doesn't give me
warmth anymore"

848
01:39:49,200 --> 01:39:54,599
"There's no sign of fidelity
in your eyes either"

849
01:39:56,400 --> 01:39:59,599
"Should someone ask me..."

850
01:40:00,080 --> 01:40:03,199
"what you mean to me..."

851
01:40:03,600 --> 01:40:07,039
"I'd say, you are one..."

852
01:40:07,480 --> 01:40:10,599
"who betrayed me,
ruined me in love"

853
01:40:36,240 --> 01:40:40,919
"The song of love that
was never ever composed..."

854
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:46,599
"you are that affliction"

855
01:40:47,600 --> 01:40:52,199
"What sweetly cheats the eyes..."

856
01:40:52,960 --> 01:40:57,279
"you are that beautiful,
false intoxication"

857
01:40:57,920 --> 01:41:02,959
"Ask your heart at least..."

858
01:41:03,600 --> 01:41:05,999
"who you belong to. Me?"

859
01:41:06,400 --> 01:41:09,799
"Or, are you another's beloved?"

860
01:41:19,600 --> 01:41:22,999
"Should someone ask me..."

861
01:41:23,600 --> 01:41:26,079
"what you mean to me..."

862
01:41:27,240 --> 01:41:30,319
"I'd say, you are one..."

863
01:41:30,800 --> 01:41:33,999
"who betrayed me,
ruined me in love"

864
01:41:42,240 --> 01:41:44,839
"You are infidel"

865
01:41:46,800 --> 01:41:49,079
"You are unfaithful"

866
01:42:23,600 --> 01:42:25,119
No, Anil!

867
01:42:34,600 --> 01:42:41,429
I have been infidel to you.
I have fallen in my own eyes, Anil.

868
01:42:42,080 --> 01:42:46,499
My honour has been disgraced.

869
01:42:46,600 --> 01:42:50,799
Nobody can wipe it.

870
01:42:51,200 --> 01:42:53,199
Nobody can wipe it.

871
01:42:59,760 --> 01:43:03,719
How is Pawan?
- I haven't thought about him.

872
01:43:04,720 --> 01:43:08,359
And Rita?
- My heart sinks at the thought of it.

873
01:43:08,960 --> 01:43:09,999
Nina?

874
01:43:11,280 --> 01:43:15,239
I mean, how is the mother
of your children?

875
01:43:15,960 --> 01:43:18,839
How can you even ask?
- What else do you want me to ask?

876
01:43:19,680 --> 01:43:22,999
Ask me why I did not kill her yet?
- Yes.

877
01:43:30,480 --> 01:43:32,999
I love Nina.
- Then?

878
01:43:34,200 --> 01:43:38,599
I don't know what I should do.
- It's very simple.

879
01:43:39,640 --> 01:43:42,999
If you want to commit a murder then
you can borrow someone's gun.

880
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:47,799
If not that, then...
- Then what?

881
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:54,719
I told you not to become a pilot
but you became.

882
01:43:55,880 --> 01:43:58,479
I told you not to get married
to her but you did.

883
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:05,479
Now, once try listening to me,
for Rita and Pawan's sake...

884
01:44:06,800 --> 01:44:08,799
forgive the mother of your children.

885
01:44:17,840 --> 01:44:23,399
You may get many women but you will
not get a mother to Rita and Pawan.

886
01:44:53,840 --> 01:44:57,029
Daddy is back!

887
01:44:57,350 --> 01:45:01,369
Daddy is back!

888
01:45:05,110 --> 01:45:09,989
Daddy, what is on your face?
- I fell down, child.

889
01:45:10,990 --> 01:45:13,269
You fell down?
- Yes, Pawan.

890
01:45:16,430 --> 01:45:19,149
You daddy has fallen
from a very great height.

891
01:45:20,030 --> 01:45:21,869
Inspite of being so grown up,
how could you fall?

892
01:45:22,150 --> 01:45:25,629
We all keep on falling
all the time, isn't it, father?

893
01:45:26,990 --> 01:45:28,989
I've never seen mother falling.

894
01:45:32,150 --> 01:45:36,709
Mother, you be with father all the
time, when he falls down, help him.

895
01:46:00,190 --> 01:46:05,149
I know that perhaps you will never be
able to live with me again.

896
01:46:07,910 --> 01:46:10,029
Besides, I cannot
even tell you anything.

897
01:46:13,350 --> 01:46:15,509
I don't deserve you anymore.

898
01:46:20,110 --> 01:46:23,789
How can I tell you that
I am Pawan and Rita's mother.

899
01:46:27,150 --> 01:46:31,389
Anil, please tell them that
their mother is dead.

900
01:46:33,350 --> 01:46:37,869
Take care of them and
make them understand.

901
01:46:39,910 --> 01:46:42,749
If they get obstinate then
please don't ever hit them.

902
01:46:46,150 --> 01:46:49,149
I have raised my children
with a lot of love.

903
01:46:53,310 --> 01:46:55,349
After you separate from me...

904
01:46:57,910 --> 01:47:00,949
you may perhaps get married again.

905
01:47:02,870 --> 01:47:05,149
But please don't keep
the children away from you.

906
01:47:10,200 --> 01:47:16,309
You understand and make
the children also understand...

907
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:22,269
that you are their mother
as well as their father.

908
01:47:27,150 --> 01:47:31,789
Where can I go if I leave Pawan...

909
01:47:35,150 --> 01:47:37,149
Rita and you?

910
01:47:40,190 --> 01:47:42,149
My world is here.

911
01:47:45,950 --> 01:47:51,389
How will I live alone if
I go away from here?

912
01:48:03,350 --> 01:48:11,399
Your fault is, probably you can't
forgive me without committing this sin

913
01:48:15,110 --> 01:48:20,269
And my fault is that I will
never be able to forgive you.

914
01:48:23,030 --> 01:48:24,029
But...

915
01:48:27,070 --> 01:48:30,309
what has Rita done?

916
01:48:32,350 --> 01:48:34,189
Pawan's not at fault either.

917
01:48:40,910 --> 01:48:43,429
For their sake, we will
have to live together...

918
01:48:47,350 --> 01:48:52,189
even if we may be dead
for each other.

919
01:49:17,870 --> 01:49:21,389
Anil, the biggest punishment for
a sin is the weight of that sin.

920
01:49:23,790 --> 01:49:26,149
I wish I could speak to you
about my feelings.

921
01:49:29,150 --> 01:49:30,709
Please forgive me.

922
01:49:33,230 --> 01:49:35,229
It is very easy to ask for
forgiveness, Nina.

923
01:49:36,950 --> 01:49:39,599
But only the person
who forgives knows how it feels.

924
01:49:41,990 --> 01:49:43,909
Will you never forgive me?

925
01:49:46,150 --> 01:49:49,149
Deserted love can be balmed
with two words of sympathy.

926
01:49:50,990 --> 01:49:53,829
A broken heart can be mended
with the tears of remorse.

927
01:49:55,990 --> 01:49:58,389
A man can perhaps get back
to life after his death.

928
01:50:00,310 --> 01:50:05,989
But this fragile bond of love which
is based on trust and beliefs...

929
01:50:07,150 --> 01:50:10,349
can never be joined back again
once it is broken.

930
01:50:10,950 --> 01:50:13,549
Fate has taken me away
from you that...

931
01:50:14,630 --> 01:50:19,249
I may never be able
to get close again.

932
01:50:19,990 --> 01:50:24,989
Even if you get close, those desires
will never come again...

933
01:50:26,870 --> 01:50:31,389
which left with you.

934
01:50:32,990 --> 01:50:36,349
They are dead and buried forever.

935
01:50:38,150 --> 01:50:41,709
I am dead for you and
you are dead for me.

936
01:51:23,790 --> 01:51:26,949
"So tranquil"

937
01:51:28,150 --> 01:51:31,149
"Such privacy"

938
01:51:32,150 --> 01:51:35,869
"The world of love..."

939
01:51:36,910 --> 01:51:39,389
"is so young"

940
01:51:40,790 --> 01:51:44,149
"So tranquil"

941
01:51:45,030 --> 01:51:47,749
"Such privacy"

942
01:51:49,150 --> 01:51:52,789
"The world of love..."

943
01:51:53,510 --> 01:51:56,269
"is so young"

944
01:52:30,990 --> 01:52:34,149
"In this winter..."

945
01:52:35,150 --> 01:52:38,549
"my body shivers"

946
01:52:42,910 --> 01:52:48,309
"Is it snow?
Or a world of marble?"

947
01:52:49,990 --> 01:52:53,709
"Let's create..."

948
01:52:54,150 --> 01:52:57,789
"a paradise right here"

949
01:52:58,470 --> 01:53:00,949
"So tranquil"

950
01:53:02,150 --> 01:53:04,629
"Such privacy"

951
01:53:06,830 --> 01:53:10,629
"The world of love..."

952
01:53:11,150 --> 01:53:14,149
"is so young"

953
01:53:40,150 --> 01:53:43,789
"The arrogant shadows..."

954
01:53:45,110 --> 01:53:47,869
"of these high mountains
boast..."

955
01:53:48,910 --> 01:53:52,149
"that no one dares..."

956
01:53:53,110 --> 01:53:56,269
"to look them in the eye"

957
01:54:05,270 --> 01:54:09,789
"Even the angels..."

958
01:54:10,310 --> 01:54:13,149
"are tongue-tied in awe here"

959
01:54:13,990 --> 01:54:17,149
"Such tranquility"

960
01:54:18,310 --> 01:54:21,149
"Such exclusiveness"

961
01:54:22,230 --> 01:54:26,229
"The world of love..."

962
01:54:26,990 --> 01:54:30,149
"is so young"

963
01:55:00,110 --> 01:55:03,389
"There is no secret..."

964
01:55:04,270 --> 01:55:07,549
"there's no veil between us either"

965
01:55:08,590 --> 01:55:11,949
"At every step..."

966
01:55:12,910 --> 01:55:14,989
"we are tempted"

967
01:55:25,190 --> 01:55:27,829
"And we leave behind..."

968
01:55:28,150 --> 01:55:32,309
"trails"

969
01:55:33,870 --> 01:55:36,549
"So tranquil"

970
01:55:37,990 --> 01:55:40,629
"So exclusive"

971
01:55:42,150 --> 01:55:45,949
"The world of love..."

972
01:55:46,790 --> 01:55:49,949
"is so young"

973
01:57:19,230 --> 01:57:21,469
When I see the tears
in your eyes...

974
01:57:23,030 --> 01:57:27,949
and start thinking that these tears
are the reminder of a sin...

975
01:57:30,150 --> 01:57:32,149
I feel ashamed of myself.

976
01:57:33,790 --> 01:57:38,989
Mrs Singh is expected, I tried to
avoid her but she wouldn't listen.

977
01:57:39,950 --> 01:57:42,149
These tears may be
very valuable for someone else...

978
01:57:43,950 --> 01:57:46,149
but they are absolutely
worthless for me.

979
01:57:47,630 --> 01:57:51,629
I said that there are
guests expected at home.

980
01:57:53,430 --> 01:57:55,269
Why did you do it, Nina?

981
01:57:56,190 --> 01:57:58,949
What was the charisma without
which, you could not survive?

982
01:58:00,270 --> 01:58:02,789
Was that charisma
more attractive than Rita...

983
01:58:03,150 --> 01:58:06,149
more innocent than Pawan
or more sacred than my love?

984
01:58:07,150 --> 01:58:09,869
We must at least behave
properly with our guests.

985
01:58:11,150 --> 01:58:15,998
My enemy would also not behave
with me the way you have, Nina.

986
01:58:17,310 --> 01:58:19,149
He would only kill me.

987
01:58:22,570 --> 01:58:28,809
But you've wounded me in such a way
that it doesn't let me live or die.

988
01:58:34,750 --> 01:58:39,589
When a man dies,
his sins are forgiven.

989
01:58:40,790 --> 01:58:43,749
No Nina, I cannot forgive you.

990
01:58:44,790 --> 01:58:48,149
I can do anything but
I cannot forgive you.

991
01:58:49,550 --> 01:58:53,959
I stayed away from home for 4 months,
any change could have occurred...

992
01:58:54,050 --> 01:58:56,149
you or I could have died...

993
01:58:56,550 --> 01:58:58,549
but my love could have never died.

994
01:58:59,430 --> 01:59:02,189
Do you love him?
Does he love you?

995
01:59:02,550 --> 01:59:06,149
Anil, I don't know anything.

996
01:59:09,500 --> 01:59:10,949
Then you should die.

997
01:59:13,500 --> 01:59:14,998
Then you should die.

998
01:59:16,910 --> 01:59:18,749
Nina, you should die.

999
01:59:18,990 --> 01:59:20,149
Then you should die.

1000
01:59:20,390 --> 01:59:22,549
Father, leave her.

1001
01:59:25,550 --> 01:59:29,549
Leave my mother or
I shall shoot you.

1002
01:59:38,550 --> 01:59:40,549
Please forgive me, son.

1003
01:59:49,550 --> 01:59:53,459
After that?
- After that, I thought...

1004
01:59:53,550 --> 01:59:57,629
that I should meet Ashok.

1005
01:59:58,630 --> 02:00:02,949
Because my Nina started feeling
that she was not fit for me

1006
02:00:03,430 --> 02:00:06,389
and I couldn't bear to
see her that way.

1007
02:00:07,390 --> 02:00:11,349
But when Nina learnt that
I was going to meet Ashok...

1008
02:00:11,750 --> 02:00:16,869
she tried to stop me, she was scared
that I may have a fight with Ashok.

1009
02:00:17,350 --> 02:00:21,149
And he would shoot me but
I did not listen to her.

1010
02:00:22,630 --> 02:00:27,189
On the way I realised my friend,
Kewal Kapoor's house was nearby.

1011
02:00:27,870 --> 02:00:30,229
I went there and
asked for his revolver.

1012
02:00:30,550 --> 02:00:32,549
And went to Ashok's place.

1013
02:00:33,390 --> 02:00:38,589
Asha opened the door and seeing me,
she said something very cheap...

1014
02:00:39,270 --> 02:00:42,869
but I did not answer her back. And I
went straight away to Ashok's room.

1015
02:00:43,390 --> 02:00:49,229
He was in the room, and I asked him
what he thinks of my Nina.

1016
02:00:50,310 --> 02:00:52,389
He asked me what I thought.

1017
02:00:53,190 --> 02:00:56,549
I told him that I love Nina.

1018
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:03,229
That rogue told me that even
he loves Nina a little bit.

1019
02:01:04,550 --> 02:01:09,749
I told him that a friend's wife
is like a sister.

1020
02:01:10,550 --> 02:01:17,909
But that debauch man gave me
a very cheap answer.

1021
02:01:18,100 --> 02:01:22,229
He said that I was not only the one
to have rights on this relationship.

1022
02:01:22,550 --> 02:01:25,069
After all its a matter of the heart
and he can fall in love with anyone.

1023
02:01:25,390 --> 02:01:27,149
In a rage, I pulled out my revolver.

1024
02:01:28,900 --> 02:01:34,589
I forgot to tell you that it was
raining very heavily that night.

1025
02:01:36,150 --> 02:01:39,109
It was thundering and lightning...

1026
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:44,149
A major lightning struck,
the electricity went off...

1027
02:01:44,550 --> 02:01:48,189
and Ashok tried to grab my revolver.

1028
02:01:48,670 --> 02:01:53,229
And thus, a fight broke out
between both of us.

1029
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:58,229
2-3 bullets were fired from my
revolver but it did not injure anyone.

1030
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:03,389
In the course of this fight,
the revolver dropped from my hands.

1031
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:06,389
And in a split moment,
Ashok went away from me.

1032
02:02:07,430 --> 02:02:11,189
The lightning struck again
and I saw that...

1033
02:02:11,550 --> 02:02:15,149
the revolver was in Ashok's hand,
he was about to shoot me...

1034
02:02:15,510 --> 02:02:18,549
when I leaped on him
and caught his hand.

1035
02:02:19,750 --> 02:02:23,909
The lightning struck again
and another shot was fired.

1036
02:02:24,550 --> 02:02:28,189
There was some more thundering
and he was shot in his head.

1037
02:02:29,110 --> 02:02:30,829
And he perhaps died.

1038
02:02:34,510 --> 02:02:39,149
Mr Sahni, are you sure that
Ashok Srivastav fired the bullet?

1039
02:02:39,550 --> 02:02:42,789
Yes, I am very sure
about that bullet.

1040
02:02:44,110 --> 02:02:47,349
When that bullet was shot,
the revolver was in Ashok's grip.

1041
02:02:48,300 --> 02:02:50,549
And I was trying to save my life.

1042
02:03:02,390 --> 02:03:04,909
Which religion do you follow?

1043
02:03:06,390 --> 02:03:07,389
Hinduism.

1044
02:03:07,710 --> 02:03:09,669
Then you must have surely
read the Ramayan.

1045
02:03:10,470 --> 02:03:13,189
Yes.
- Then you must be knowing that...

1046
02:03:13,550 --> 02:03:18,389
when Ravan, kidnaped
Lord Ram's wife, Sita...

1047
02:03:18,830 --> 02:03:23,909
and when Lord Ram learnt about it,
he attacked Ravan and killed him.

1048
02:03:24,670 --> 02:03:25,669
Yes.

1049
02:03:26,430 --> 02:03:29,549
You think what Lord Ram did was right?
- Yes.

1050
02:03:30,200 --> 02:03:33,109
According to you, a husband
should kill such a man?

1051
02:03:33,550 --> 02:03:35,549
But my intention of going to
Ashok's place was not that.

1052
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:40,149
If your intention was not that
then why did you take a revolver?

1053
02:03:40,550 --> 02:03:42,229
To protect myself.

1054
02:03:42,550 --> 02:03:46,549
I thought if a man can ruin
a decent woman's honour...

1055
02:03:46,950 --> 02:03:51,149
can even shoot at me.
- Great presence of mind.

1056
02:03:52,030 --> 02:03:55,789
On one hand, you felt that
you may lose control over yourself.

1057
02:03:56,110 --> 02:03:59,389
And on the other hand, you even
took care of your safety?

1058
02:04:00,550 --> 02:04:06,269
You can say anything you want.
- Anil, you were taking guarded steps.

1059
02:04:06,670 --> 02:04:08,909
You were not scared at all.

1060
02:04:09,310 --> 02:04:10,949
This is not true.

1061
02:04:11,390 --> 02:04:15,869
In fear, man cannot focus
on more than one thing at a time.

1062
02:04:16,750 --> 02:04:18,789
Your statement is a beautiful tale...

1063
02:04:19,630 --> 02:04:23,189
which after the murder, was
a brain work of an intelligent mind.

1064
02:04:23,550 --> 02:04:28,389
Thank you Mr Khan for appreciating
my intelligent mind.

1065
02:04:33,550 --> 02:04:38,389
Mr Sahni, why were you upset?
- For the sake of my honour.

1066
02:04:39,750 --> 02:04:44,229
Don't you know that no man can
successfully dishonour a woman...

1067
02:04:44,550 --> 02:04:48,309
until and unless a woman
does not participate in it?

1068
02:04:48,670 --> 02:04:53,909
I would like to remind my friend that
this case is regarding a murder...

1069
02:04:54,230 --> 02:04:56,549
it's not a case of adultery
committed by the accused's wife.

1070
02:04:56,870 --> 02:04:59,949
I beg your pardon but I said because,
the court's time shouldn't be wasted...

1071
02:05:00,150 --> 02:05:05,149
but there is no doubt that my friend
is himself defaming a woman's honour.

1072
02:05:05,550 --> 02:05:07,549
I mean, by levying such accusations.

1073
02:05:08,550 --> 02:05:12,909
Your Honour, my friend needs
to be told that sometimes...

1074
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:18,029
he should learn to be patient, which
of course is against his nature.

1075
02:05:20,390 --> 02:05:23,549
You went to Ashok's place
to speak with him.

1076
02:05:24,390 --> 02:05:25,389
Yes.

1077
02:05:25,750 --> 02:05:31,069
In such a stormy weather? Such a
night was very conducive for murder.

1078
02:05:31,470 --> 02:05:33,909
This is not true.
- No, it is.

1079
02:05:34,550 --> 02:05:37,389
If you were so keen on
speaking with him then...

1080
02:05:37,750 --> 02:05:41,789
after you spoke to your wife,
you would have immediately...

1081
02:05:41,992 --> 02:05:44,349
gone there and asked him
the reason for all this?

1082
02:05:45,510 --> 02:05:49,149
But you did no such thing,
you first thought about it...

1083
02:05:49,510 --> 02:05:51,949
planned it out,
managed to get a revolver...

1084
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:56,109
then you went to Ashok's house
and killed that unarmed man.

1085
02:05:57,630 --> 02:06:02,629
Mr Sahni, a man who is upset
cannot think of such a plan.

1086
02:06:03,700 --> 02:06:05,749
You are a murderer.
- No, I am not!

1087
02:06:05,850 --> 02:06:07,999
I have not murdered anybody.

1088
02:06:08,250 --> 02:06:11,529
Please understand, in our fight,
the bullets were fired accidentally.

1089
02:06:12,230 --> 02:06:16,749
Mr Sahni, we have no such proof
on the basis of which we know that...

1090
02:06:17,150 --> 02:06:19,029
the gun fired automatically.

1091
02:06:19,350 --> 02:06:22,909
The revolver cannot be shot
until the trigger is not pressed.

1092
02:06:23,310 --> 02:06:26,589
And until there is no pressure put
on the trigger, it doesn't work.

1093
02:06:27,150 --> 02:06:31,629
and the pressure is not built until
the trigger is not gripped properly.

1094
02:06:32,350 --> 02:06:35,069
Mr Sahni, the bullet wasn't fired
with the air pressure.

1095
02:06:35,430 --> 02:06:38,589
But in fight, the revolver can be
fired with hand movements.

1096
02:06:38,950 --> 02:06:41,709
I understand Mr Sahni that
you are a sharpshooter.

1097
02:06:42,990 --> 02:06:46,469
But in a fight of 1 1/2 minute, how
many times can a revolver be fired?

1098
02:06:47,590 --> 02:06:49,789
All this means that...

1099
02:06:50,190 --> 02:06:56,509
you gruesomely killed your friend,
Ashok in a very professional manner.

1100
02:06:57,150 --> 02:06:59,509
I did not kill anyone!
- All killers say the same.

1101
02:07:00,070 --> 02:07:01,909
The bullets were fired accidentally.

1102
02:07:02,190 --> 02:07:05,909
This is an old story.
- I am not a killer! I'm not!

1103
02:07:06,390 --> 02:07:09,069
Why are you shouting so loudly?

1104
02:07:09,430 --> 02:07:13,909
That's because, you have killed
Ashok, you are his murderer.

1105
02:07:18,630 --> 02:07:20,869
If there is a display of disorder
in the court...

1106
02:07:21,190 --> 02:07:23,629
then besides the people
connected with this case...

1107
02:07:23,990 --> 02:07:27,589
nobody else will be allowed in the
courtroom. I have tolerated enough.

1108
02:07:54,190 --> 02:07:56,589
Don't you also believe
Anil's statement?

1109
02:07:59,110 --> 02:08:03,269
I feel Anil is saying the truth.
But nobody knows the truth.

1110
02:08:04,230 --> 02:08:06,589
The court asks for evidences.

1111
02:08:07,190 --> 02:08:09,349
There is nothing that can
identify truth from deceit.

1112
02:08:11,430 --> 02:08:13,349
And the evidences are against Anil.

1113
02:08:36,190 --> 02:08:37,989
Do you love Anil a lot?

1114
02:08:38,350 --> 02:08:41,029
I can do anything for Anil,
even give up my life.

1115
02:08:41,350 --> 02:08:45,349
Then listen to me, I shall ask for
the permission to call you again.

1116
02:08:46,350 --> 02:08:47,349
And...

1117
02:08:50,110 --> 02:08:53,029
Do you remember,
you stated that...

1118
02:08:53,350 --> 02:08:56,989
you met Ashok Srivastav
the first time in his flat?

1119
02:08:57,350 --> 02:08:58,989
Yes.
- You had lied.

1120
02:08:59,350 --> 02:09:02,149
You met Ashok Srivastav
the first time in Europe.

1121
02:09:04,150 --> 02:09:05,869
No.
- I can prove that...

1122
02:09:06,190 --> 02:09:08,749
you came to India for him...

1123
02:09:09,150 --> 02:09:12,269
and by force of habit,
when he refused to marry you,...

1124
02:09:12,590 --> 02:09:15,029
you got married to Anil Sahni,
isn't this is the truth?

1125
02:09:15,350 --> 02:09:16,709
Well, I...

1126
02:09:17,070 --> 02:09:19,709
You could not forget Ashok
even after your marriage.

1127
02:09:20,030 --> 02:09:23,749
And when you saw that he wants
to love you but marry Asha...

1128
02:09:24,150 --> 02:09:28,029
you told your husband, Anil
everything to seek your revenge.

1129
02:09:28,350 --> 02:09:31,869
Because, you were aware that
no man can tolerate this.

1130
02:09:32,230 --> 02:09:35,029
He would lose control
and kill that person.

1131
02:09:35,900 --> 02:09:40,109
Isn't this the truth?
I want an answer Mrs Sahni.

1132
02:09:40,510 --> 02:09:44,549
Yes, I wanted that Ashok should
belong only to me and nobody else.

1133
02:09:46,150 --> 02:09:48,229
I wanted that Ashok should belong
only to me and nobody else!

1134
02:09:51,590 --> 02:09:54,029
In order to save me, if you
need to make her say all this...

1135
02:09:54,350 --> 02:09:56,749
then your honour, I would like
to say that I have killed Ashok.

1136
02:09:57,110 --> 02:09:59,989
What are you doing?
- I am right, I have killed Ashok.

1137
02:10:00,350 --> 02:10:02,989
What are you trying to prove?
- I can kill him many more times.

1138
02:10:03,350 --> 02:10:05,349
I am trying to save you and...

1139
02:10:33,230 --> 02:10:36,069
I told you even before that
you need complete rest.

1140
02:10:39,190 --> 02:10:41,349
Any kind of excitement can
prove to be dangerous for you.

1141
02:10:42,310 --> 02:10:44,309
You will not go
to the court tomorrow.

1142
02:10:45,350 --> 02:10:47,549
At least think about
your children, Mrs Sahni.

1143
02:10:52,350 --> 02:10:54,669
This world is
a very strange place, doctor.

1144
02:10:56,190 --> 02:11:00,109
Neither does it let you live
nor does it let you die.

1145
02:11:05,310 --> 02:11:08,909
I would like Mr Mukherjee to present
the case in the accused's defense.

1146
02:11:19,550 --> 02:11:24,229
This accused is amongst the people
for whom their house is a temple...

1147
02:11:24,590 --> 02:11:26,629
the wife is the Goddess
of that temple and...

1148
02:11:27,030 --> 02:11:28,909
the children are
the lamps of that temple.

1149
02:11:30,230 --> 02:11:34,029
And this accused is amongst the
people who love their devotion...

1150
02:11:34,350 --> 02:11:37,349
and gain a spiritual satisfaction
with their devotion.

1151
02:11:38,550 --> 02:11:42,029
If such a devotee learns that the
woman whom he considers a Goddess...

1152
02:11:42,350 --> 02:11:44,869
has been tainted by
a devotee of lust...

1153
02:11:45,230 --> 02:11:47,829
then no self-respecting man
can stay silent.

1154
02:11:49,150 --> 02:11:51,829
Yes, he acted very patiently...

1155
02:11:52,270 --> 02:11:57,029
he gave a chance to his friend
that he can improve himself.

1156
02:11:58,070 --> 02:12:00,149
But that man was
not willing to do so.

1157
02:12:01,190 --> 02:12:05,949
When there is a bout between deceit
and truth, the truth is overshadowed.

1158
02:12:06,350 --> 02:12:10,749
When the weak and strong men fight,
the weak man attacks first.

1159
02:12:11,150 --> 02:12:13,069
This is the law of nature and...

1160
02:12:13,350 --> 02:12:16,669
this is exactly what transpired
between both of them.

1161
02:12:17,190 --> 02:12:19,749
There was a deadly fight between
the good and the bad...

1162
02:12:20,150 --> 02:12:22,029
and nature could not be silent.

1163
02:12:22,350 --> 02:12:25,029
To end the evil and
to help the good prevail...

1164
02:12:25,350 --> 02:12:28,029
the revolver was shot
by the hands of the good...

1165
02:12:28,350 --> 02:12:31,029
which in legal language
is called accident.

1166
02:12:32,350 --> 02:12:35,029
We may not accept this decision of
nature but to held the accused...

1167
02:12:35,350 --> 02:12:40,349
responsible for this accident, will
be a great injustice on our part.

1168
02:12:42,310 --> 02:12:46,749
Members of the jury, my dear
friend is trying to prove...

1169
02:12:47,150 --> 02:12:50,829
that the accused
planned out the murder.

1170
02:12:51,350 --> 02:12:53,829
He is trying to say that
the accused sought...

1171
02:12:54,150 --> 02:12:56,749
his revenge by killing
the man who ruined his house.

1172
02:12:57,350 --> 02:12:59,669
But when you announce
your decision patiently...

1173
02:13:00,030 --> 02:13:03,029
you will realise yourself
that this helpless man...

1174
02:13:03,350 --> 02:13:06,269
was just dreaming of saving
his house from destruction.

1175
02:13:06,590 --> 02:13:09,829
He was trying to save it
from falling apart.

1176
02:13:10,150 --> 02:13:13,749
And to keep his children alive,
he was trying to extinguish...

1177
02:13:14,110 --> 02:13:16,469
the fire within him
with his own blood.

1178
02:13:18,470 --> 02:13:22,029
Members of the jury, if the law
of this country believes that...

1179
02:13:22,350 --> 02:13:24,349
the innocent should be let free...

1180
02:13:25,230 --> 02:13:28,149
then to safeguard this law and
to respect the judicial system...

1181
02:13:28,510 --> 02:13:31,509
Anil Kumar Sahni,
should be let out free.

1182
02:13:32,350 --> 02:13:35,029
If he is punished then
the people who spread evil...

1183
02:13:35,350 --> 02:13:38,069
on the basis of power
and wealth will celebrate.

1184
02:13:38,430 --> 02:13:43,189
Innocent women will be
victimized by such evil men.

1185
02:13:43,550 --> 02:13:49,269
And our pure principals will perish
in that unholy fire.

1186
02:13:51,310 --> 02:13:55,229
Members of jury, Anil Kumar Sahni
is not guilty.

1187
02:13:56,230 --> 02:13:59,989
He has not committed any offense in
the eyes of the world and law.

1188
02:14:00,350 --> 02:14:04,149
If any man who has done an offense,
is his friend Ashok Srivastav...

1189
02:14:04,510 --> 02:14:07,829
and his debauch acts.

1190
02:14:28,230 --> 02:14:32,949
You just heard the famous lawyer,
Mr Mukherjee present...

1191
02:14:33,310 --> 02:14:38,589
a defense case in favour
of the accused.

1192
02:14:40,550 --> 02:14:41,599
And See him...

1193
02:14:43,590 --> 02:14:46,949
And while the presentation was
being made, I was thinking...

1194
02:14:47,430 --> 02:14:51,189
that am I hearing a presentation
of a lawyer in the court...

1195
02:14:52,550 --> 02:14:56,829
or am I watching a good actor's
performance on the stage?

1196
02:14:58,150 --> 02:15:01,309
But members of the jury, this is not
a hermitage of the saints...

1197
02:15:01,710 --> 02:15:04,109
this is not a stage of a theater,
this is a courtroom.

1198
02:15:04,670 --> 02:15:07,749
Here the decision is not announced
seeing the accused's character,...

1199
02:15:07,900 --> 02:15:10,989
his innocent face,
his grand uniform...

1200
02:15:11,200 --> 02:15:13,549
or the status he commands
in the society.

1201
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:17,549
Its made on basis of the evidences
and statements presented in the court.

1202
02:15:19,150 --> 02:15:22,349
The basic rule of law is that
no man can kill anyone...

1203
02:15:23,910 --> 02:15:25,749
or take the law in his hands.

1204
02:15:26,350 --> 02:15:30,349
Members of the jury, we are not
concerned with...

1205
02:15:31,150 --> 02:15:32,989
what the accused was and what he is.

1206
02:15:33,550 --> 02:15:38,949
We are only concerned with what
the accused did and what he didn't.

1207
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:45,349
My friend even accepts that after
the accused spoke with his wife...

1208
02:15:46,110 --> 02:15:48,349
took a revolver and
headed towards Ashok's house.

1209
02:15:49,350 --> 02:15:54,069
He even says that only with the
intention of speaking,...

1210
02:15:54,470 --> 02:15:56,349
the accused went to Ashok's place.

1211
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:03,709
Members of jury, note this point,
he went with a revolver to speak.

1212
02:16:05,350 --> 02:16:08,189
He wants us to believe
that one man...

1213
02:16:08,250 --> 02:16:13,109
after hearing about the debauchery
committed by his wife...

1214
02:16:13,630 --> 02:16:17,109
went to that man's house only
to speak, that too, with a revolver.

1215
02:16:17,470 --> 02:16:19,709
And Anil did not kill
Ashok intentionally.

1216
02:16:21,150 --> 02:16:24,349
He himself died
because of his misfortune.

1217
02:16:25,350 --> 02:16:28,509
Just due to his misfortune.

1218
02:16:29,230 --> 02:16:31,749
My friend accepts that
there was a fight.

1219
02:16:32,549 --> 02:16:35,348
But the question that arises
is that if there was a fight...

1220
02:16:35,900 --> 02:16:38,749
then whose fingerprints
were on the revolver?

1221
02:16:40,389 --> 02:16:43,628
As per the report of
the fingerprint experts...

1222
02:16:45,150 --> 02:16:47,469
the revolver had only
the fingerprints of the accused.

1223
02:16:48,549 --> 02:16:51,028
After this, there is no scope
for any doubt...

1224
02:16:52,230 --> 02:16:55,349
that the revolver was shot by the
accused and that too, intentionally.

1225
02:16:56,190 --> 02:16:59,789
Members of the jury, the law
and justice of this country...

1226
02:17:00,190 --> 02:17:04,509
and the judicial system of
this country is under scrutiny.

1227
02:17:06,110 --> 02:17:11,149
Not only my friend,
Mr Mukherjee and I...

1228
02:17:12,309 --> 02:17:14,908
the accused and his relatives...

1229
02:17:15,309 --> 02:17:18,988
but every person in this country is
anxiously waiting for the judgment.

1230
02:17:19,549 --> 02:17:24,348
Members of the jury, if the accused
is pronounced not guilty...

1231
02:17:26,350 --> 02:17:28,989
then the walls of this judicial
system will start cracking.

1232
02:17:30,070 --> 02:17:33,749
And instead of expecting law
and justice in this court...

1233
02:17:34,150 --> 02:17:37,629
the future generation will
run away from this system.

1234
02:17:38,510 --> 02:17:42,869
That's why, it should be remembered,
one who marks this date in history...

1235
02:17:43,590 --> 02:17:47,829
should not be ashamed
at the mention of this case.

1236
02:17:48,590 --> 02:17:52,989
My friend has said that
the innocent one should be set free.

1237
02:17:54,270 --> 02:17:59,749
Even I share the same opinion that
the innocent one should be freed.

1238
02:18:01,430 --> 02:18:05,709
But members of the jury, the
person guilty should be punished...

1239
02:18:06,309 --> 02:18:11,748
to respect justice and to uphold
the law, the guilty should be punished

1240
02:18:12,230 --> 02:18:14,029
And Anil is guilty.

1241
02:18:30,350 --> 02:18:36,829
Now you've lost the case, before you
leave, can I invite you for dinner?

1242
02:18:38,070 --> 02:18:40,469
I think I'll wait for you
in the library.

1243
02:18:40,950 --> 02:18:43,349
Yes, and even I think that
I should accept her invitation.

1244
02:18:43,590 --> 02:18:44,829
Go ahead.

1245
02:18:45,350 --> 02:18:47,829
Thank you,
but can I know...

1246
02:18:48,190 --> 02:18:50,989
after the death of your every
would-be husband...

1247
02:18:51,350 --> 02:18:53,589
you invite strangers at home?

1248
02:18:56,510 --> 02:18:58,989
Should I assume that this time
it is my turn?

1249
02:18:59,309 --> 02:19:02,988
Forget about that old story.

1250
02:19:03,549 --> 02:19:05,548
But one thing is incomplete.

1251
02:19:06,150 --> 02:19:09,349
If Anil Sahni would understand
my question...

1252
02:19:10,150 --> 02:19:12,149
then at least he would be
saved from the noose.

1253
02:19:12,510 --> 02:19:15,349
Not all desires are fulfilled,
Mr Mukherjee.

1254
02:19:16,350 --> 02:19:20,199
Even Ashok died with the desire
of possessing Nina.

1255
02:19:21,730 --> 02:19:25,129
Yes, you said the right thing...

1256
02:19:26,090 --> 02:19:30,049
either Ashok should belong to you
or to nobody else.

1257
02:19:32,799 --> 02:19:36,448
Do you remember saying this?
- Well... yes.

1258
02:19:37,010 --> 02:19:39,579
Like Nina, even you are fond
of digging up old graves.

1259
02:19:39,680 --> 02:19:41,929
Individual liking, Ms Asha.

1260
02:19:42,290 --> 02:19:45,449
Some like to save lives,
and some like to take lives.

1261
02:19:47,290 --> 02:19:51,089
Yes, Mr Ali?
- Still trying to save Anil's life?

1262
02:19:51,490 --> 02:19:53,769
Well, that is...
- By tomorrow...

1263
02:19:54,170 --> 02:19:57,049
his death sentence will be announced.
- I think the same, but Mr Ali...

1264
02:19:57,450 --> 02:20:03,419
I would like to see
the place where Ashok was killed.

1265
02:20:03,530 --> 02:20:06,849
But you are having dinner with me?
- We'll have dinner after that...

1266
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:11,089
you can also accompany us.
- But corpses do not speak.

1267
02:20:11,650 --> 02:20:15,809
Ali, you know that I like to
make the corpses speak.

1268
02:20:17,330 --> 02:20:19,129
Are you scared?
- No.

1269
02:20:19,450 --> 02:20:22,099
One day, we all have to die.
come.

1270
02:20:36,890 --> 02:20:40,249
I want one more chance to save Anil.
Will you help me?

1271
02:20:40,570 --> 02:20:42,889
Help my sworn enemy?
- Yes.

1272
02:20:43,970 --> 02:20:44,969
I will.

1273
02:20:45,250 --> 02:20:48,249
I want to send my junior
to Ashok Srivastav's house.

1274
02:20:49,090 --> 02:20:52,569
I need the permission.
- It will be arranged.

1275
02:21:11,130 --> 02:21:13,489
Agreed that you can make
the corpses speak...

1276
02:21:15,130 --> 02:21:17,889
but when life is standing here
and calling you...

1277
02:21:18,250 --> 02:21:20,249
then why are you interested
in the dead?

1278
02:21:20,930 --> 02:21:24,809
Isn't it, Mr Khan? Let's go
for a dance, dinner and then...

1279
02:21:25,210 --> 02:21:28,809
Ms Asha...
- I thought you were joking.

1280
02:21:29,250 --> 02:21:32,889
Ms Asha, I've taken years to learn
about this trick.

1281
02:21:33,250 --> 02:21:35,929
I still believe that
when a man dies suddenly...

1282
02:21:36,250 --> 02:21:39,609
his spirit is restless
because his desires are unfulfilled.

1283
02:21:40,090 --> 02:21:43,249
You were very close to Ashok
and you loved him...

1284
02:21:43,530 --> 02:21:45,729
would you want his soul to wander?
- No.

1285
02:21:46,130 --> 02:21:48,249
You've got the keys from
the police then open the door.

1286
02:21:49,090 --> 02:21:52,249
Oh! This opened by itself?

1287
02:21:54,090 --> 02:21:55,729
Please switch on the lights.

1288
02:22:00,050 --> 02:22:01,649
Come, what happened?

1289
02:22:02,250 --> 02:22:04,649
Ali, did you feel a whiff of air
breeze across?

1290
02:22:05,050 --> 02:22:06,729
I did.
- And you?

1291
02:22:08,250 --> 02:22:10,889
Many storms have breezed
in my life...

1292
02:22:12,050 --> 02:22:15,529
such whiff of air
has no effect on me.

1293
02:22:16,090 --> 02:22:19,249
I really appreciate your courage.
Let's go inside.

1294
02:22:24,330 --> 02:22:30,449
Ashok Srivastav,
due to your sudden death...

1295
02:22:31,970 --> 02:22:33,969
your soul is not at peace.

1296
02:22:35,250 --> 02:22:37,969
If you want that your soul
should rest in peace...

1297
02:22:39,250 --> 02:22:41,249
then please appear before us.

1298
02:22:42,130 --> 02:22:45,249
Put out that cigarette, Ali.
You please put out the lights soon.

1299
02:22:54,250 --> 02:22:55,409
Come back soon.

1300
02:22:57,130 --> 02:22:58,129
Sit down.

1301
02:23:03,090 --> 02:23:05,489
We are waiting for your reply.

1302
02:23:07,450 --> 02:23:12,689
We want to remind you
that Anil killed you.

1303
02:23:14,410 --> 02:23:17,569
Three bullets were shot
from his revolver.

1304
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:23,729
Two hit the wall
and one hit your head.

1305
02:23:24,290 --> 02:23:27,449
No.
- Then?

1306
02:23:28,290 --> 02:23:31,929
The third hit at the painting
at my bedside.

1307
02:23:32,450 --> 02:23:37,649
At the painting on your bedside
that means...

1308
02:23:37,850 --> 02:23:40,809
What...?
- That means Anil did not kill Ashok.

1309
02:23:42,450 --> 02:23:44,649
That's what the spirit says...
but let's check the painting.

1310
02:23:57,330 --> 02:23:59,449
Where could the bullet
have hit on this painting?

1311
02:24:01,450 --> 02:24:04,089
Ali look here,
the bullet hit here.

1312
02:24:04,450 --> 02:24:07,649
That means nobody saw this earlier?
- Nobody could see it.

1313
02:24:08,290 --> 02:24:10,769
Now, if Ashok did not die with
Anil's bullet then how did he?

1314
02:24:11,530 --> 02:24:16,489
The police has stated that out of
six bullets, Anil fired only three.

1315
02:24:16,850 --> 02:24:19,449
That means Ashok died
with the fourth bullet.

1316
02:24:20,250 --> 02:24:25,729
But who fired the fourth bullet?
- Let's ask the spirit.

1317
02:24:26,290 --> 02:24:29,769
Why do you want to ask
Ashok's spirit, I will tell you.

1318
02:24:30,690 --> 02:24:34,449
The fourth bullet was fired from
the same revolver which killed Ashok.

1319
02:24:35,490 --> 02:24:39,249
And today, the same revolver will
take you both close to Ashok.

1320
02:24:39,570 --> 02:24:41,129
Then you can ask him.

1321
02:24:48,290 --> 02:24:49,449
Let go!

1322
02:24:53,530 --> 02:24:56,849
Come out Mr Khan, Mr Mukherjee.

1323
02:24:57,250 --> 02:24:59,009
Here is the killer.
- Have you caught her?

1324
02:24:59,250 --> 02:25:01,889
Yes.
- Thank God we are saved!

1325
02:25:02,290 --> 02:25:04,769
Agarwal, how did you come here?
- Somebody had to play the spirit.

1326
02:25:05,170 --> 02:25:08,129
And who could have been better
than him? Thanks for saving us.

1327
02:25:08,450 --> 02:25:12,089
I sneaked into this flat
and inspected it.

1328
02:25:12,450 --> 02:25:16,289
I was hiding in Ashok's cupboard
and acting as his spirit.

1329
02:25:16,650 --> 02:25:19,969
This was my plan.
- Now this case has taken a new twist.

1330
02:25:20,370 --> 02:25:23,089
I told you that Anil was not
the killer but you did not listen.

1331
02:25:23,810 --> 02:25:27,249
I'll report to the police.
- Yes, go. But keep the pillow here.

1332
02:25:28,490 --> 02:25:31,129
What do I do with her?
- Hold her properly.

1333
02:25:32,150 --> 02:25:34,689
Yes, I was the one who shot Ashok.

1334
02:25:35,150 --> 02:25:38,589
And until debauch men like
Ashok Srivastav are alive...

1335
02:25:38,990 --> 02:25:42,149
every young girl has
the right to shoot like this.

1336
02:25:43,950 --> 02:25:47,309
Do you have to say anything
about Ms Asha's statement?

1337
02:25:48,270 --> 02:25:52,949
Your Honour, Ms Asha has
made a confession about her crime.

1338
02:25:54,230 --> 02:25:59,149
The circumstances under which she
confessed her crime...

1339
02:25:59,790 --> 02:26:01,989
in Ashok's flat,
I was there to witness it.

1340
02:26:03,150 --> 02:26:05,149
I have nothing more to say.

1341
02:26:05,510 --> 02:26:07,509
But I have to say
something, your honour.

1342
02:26:08,230 --> 02:26:11,549
The evidences are
strong against Ms Asha...

1343
02:26:12,230 --> 02:26:17,549
but nobody can think that the bullet
extracted from Ashok's body...

1344
02:26:17,950 --> 02:26:21,789
does not belong to her revolver
but to some third revolver...

1345
02:26:22,150 --> 02:26:25,149
which I accidentally discovered
in the drainpipe.

1346
02:26:27,790 --> 02:26:29,509
Your Honour, this is that revolver.

1347
02:26:30,950 --> 02:26:35,909
Ballistic reports say that the
bullet from this gun killed Ashok.

1348
02:26:36,270 --> 02:26:41,789
And the fingerprint experts say that
this gun has Ashok's fingerprints.

1349
02:26:43,030 --> 02:26:48,949
Anil's statement says,
"I and Ashok had a deadly fight"

1350
02:26:49,350 --> 02:26:54,309
"2-3 bullets were fired from my
revolver but it did not injure anyone"

1351
02:26:54,910 --> 02:26:56,949
"In the course of this fight,
the revolver dropped from my hands"

1352
02:26:57,310 --> 02:26:59,749
"And in a split moment,
Ashok went away from me"

1353
02:27:00,110 --> 02:27:02,629
"The lightning struck again
and I saw that..."

1354
02:27:03,030 --> 02:27:04,869
"the revolver was in Ashok's hand"

1355
02:27:05,950 --> 02:27:11,669
It's quite obvious that during this
time Ashok had taken out his revolver.

1356
02:27:12,230 --> 02:27:15,789
Your Honour, this is the revolver
with which Ashok died.

1357
02:27:16,150 --> 02:27:19,549
This revolver has only
Ashok's fingerprints.

1358
02:27:19,950 --> 02:27:23,869
That means, Ashok killed himself.

1359
02:27:26,950 --> 02:27:32,789
Your Honour, on the night of murder,
when Anil went to Ashok's flat...

1360
02:27:33,270 --> 02:27:35,709
and when a fight broke out
between them...

1361
02:27:36,150 --> 02:27:38,709
at that time, Anil had
a revolver in his hand.

1362
02:27:39,950 --> 02:27:41,709
They fell on the bed.

1363
02:27:42,030 --> 02:27:45,189
Three bullets were fired from
Anil's gun, but no one was injured.

1364
02:27:46,150 --> 02:27:48,789
Meanwhile, Anil's revolver
fell on the floor...

1365
02:27:49,870 --> 02:27:53,029
Ashok pushed Anil and
sped towards the table.

1366
02:27:53,350 --> 02:27:57,309
He took out his revolver from the
drawer which Anil did not notice.

1367
02:27:58,870 --> 02:28:00,989
And impulsively,
Anil went for the gun.

1368
02:28:01,350 --> 02:28:05,149
And they started fighting again,
Asha was watching everything.

1369
02:28:05,830 --> 02:28:10,509
They were yet fighting and meanwhile,
Asha took out her revolver...

1370
02:28:10,950 --> 02:28:14,829
she thought that she wouldn't get
a better chance to seek her revenge.

1371
02:28:15,800 --> 02:28:19,469
Both were fighting and reached to
a window and Asha shot at Ashok.

1372
02:28:19,550 --> 02:28:21,869
At the same time, Ashok's revolver
also fired a bullet...

1373
02:28:22,150 --> 02:28:24,549
which hit his head and killed him.

1374
02:28:25,190 --> 02:28:26,989
Scared, Anil ran off!

1375
02:28:27,350 --> 02:28:30,349
Asha didn't realise that
she missed her aim.

1376
02:28:30,950 --> 02:28:34,749
She was sure that
Ashok died of her bullet.

1377
02:28:36,030 --> 02:28:38,589
To save herself, the revolver
that had Ashok's fingerprints...

1378
02:28:38,700 --> 02:28:42,789
she covered it in a kerchief
and hid it in the drainpipe.

1379
02:28:43,150 --> 02:28:48,669
And let Anil's revolver which had
Anil's fingerprints, remain there.

1380
02:28:49,990 --> 02:28:53,309
That is why, your honour, members
of the jury, it is proved that...

1381
02:28:53,710 --> 02:28:55,989
Ashok Srivastav killed himself.

1382
02:28:56,950 --> 02:29:01,709
Anil Kumar Sahni is innocent
and he should be released.

1383
02:29:04,860 --> 02:29:06,699
This was a very strange case.

1384
02:29:07,660 --> 02:29:10,899
Nature has meted out justice
at the hands of the criminal.

1385
02:29:11,900 --> 02:29:14,899
The unanimous decision of
the members of the jury is that...

1386
02:29:15,700 --> 02:29:18,739
that Ashok Srivastav
accidentally killed himself.

1387
02:29:19,100 --> 02:29:24,379
The court seconds this decision
and releases Anil Sahni.

1388
02:29:28,780 --> 02:29:31,379
I am very happy!

1389
02:29:31,900 --> 02:29:35,199
To see this day
I had prayed to God.

1390
02:29:35,580 --> 02:29:41,299
I told God to keep me alive for this
day and then he can take away my life.

1391
02:29:45,740 --> 02:29:50,179
Who can experience this joy
even after laying down his life?

1392
02:29:50,900 --> 02:29:56,259
I did not sin, Anil
but please forgive me.

1393
02:29:56,900 --> 02:30:00,619
Until then, the fire would have
burned my body and made it pure.

1394
02:30:00,940 --> 02:30:02,899
Don't say that, Nina!
