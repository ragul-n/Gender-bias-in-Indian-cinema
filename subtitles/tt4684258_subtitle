SURIYA presents

2
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:06,000
"Come, my precious princess"

3
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:10,040
"With vigor, as a youngster
let's rise to the occasion, dear"

4
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,960
"Kick up your heels, no fear"

5
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,920
"Go get them, tiger Venture and wager"

6
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,200
"If the town wants to know about you"

7
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,920
"Hey! Set up a mike and boldly roar
your name loudly into the speaker"

8
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:01,800
"People will put you on a pedestal
Weigh you as 24 carat gold, girl"

9
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,920
"Lock, stock and barrel
They will lock you up, girl"

10
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,080
"Walk out of your prison, dear"

11
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:12,280
"You be your own savior"

12
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:32,760
"Walk out of your prison, dear"

13
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,400
"With vigor, as a youngster
let's rise to the occasion, dear"

14
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,560
"Kick up your heels, no fear"

15
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:47,040
"Go get them, tiger Venture and wager"

16
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,520
How old are you?

17
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,000
36

18
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,960
(loud yawn)

19
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,280
President's convoy has
moved from Raj Bhavan

20
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,720
We've got general details
about Vasanthi Tamil selvan

21
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,080
She works as upper division
clerk in the revenue department

22
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,680
Her husband Mr Tamil selvan...

23
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,800
...is a program executive
in All India Radio, Chennai

24
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,920
Collect all details about
Vasanthi Tamil selvan

25
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,480
Within the next 24 hours
Personal and professional

26
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,720
Sir, how can we do it
at such short notice?

27
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,920
Use all possible sources

28
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:49,040
If we do a parallel investigation with
Intelligence Bureau it's no big deal

29
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,120
We have enough time

30
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,520
How many places will they divert

31
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,840
- Who's that?
- Vasanthi's husband

32
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,400
Honestly, I find this uncivilized!

33
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,880
At such short notice we must
collect complete information

34
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,280
We have no other go
but to use technology

35
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:38,200
Madam, if you wave your hand
only auto will stop, not bus

36
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,080
Sir, nothing to worry

37
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,400
But the boy is a little
shaken up, that's all

38
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:51,120
We've informed the boy's family, sir

39
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,320
What happened, Tamil?

40
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,520
A school boy fell on my car and got hurt

41
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,640
But nothing serious

42
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,880
It wasn't sir's mistake
That boy crossed suddenly

43
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:02,960
His dad is a reporter-

44
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:03,680
I know

45
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,640
First information report
hasn't been filed as yet

46
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,600
Your insurance and license are in order?

47
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,800
It isn't a major case

48
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,680
It will be filed under
sections 336 and 337

49
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,560
You can get away with a fine!

50
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,000
Why are you hesitating?

51
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,520
I may go to Ireland for a job

52
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,480
After a 2 year struggle
I've finally got a placement

53
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,160
My visa interview is this week

54
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:25,200
I don't want a police case
hindering my visa, Murthy

55
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,840
That boy's dad is a reporter

56
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,440
I'm worried he may create problems

57
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,880
I don't know all that
Somehow help me, please

58
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,920
Anyone else in your
family holds a license?

59
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,120
My wife has

60
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,240
Is she going with you to Ireland?

61
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,560
She has attended the interview

62
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,880
But it won't work out

63
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,560
I can't take her now on a dependent visa

64
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,640
Looks like I'll be travelling alone

65
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,640
Bro, he's the man who hit our boy

66
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,400
That boy's dad, wrestler Ranganathan

67
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,880
Your wife has a driving license?

68
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,560
Did you get a ticket?

69
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,440
Conductor, stop at Adyar

70
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,080
Why are you digging into my ribs?

71
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,080
I must get down at Jayanthi theatre

72
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,920
Another 6 stops to go Get inside

73
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,840
Move

74
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,880
Still 6 more stops to Adyar

75
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,480
Hahn?

76
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,560
What 'OH'?

77
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,280
You made a mother of 7 get up
and you're sitting here happily!

78
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:44,120
- Okay, sit
- No need, you sit

79
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,840
What happened to your 'idli' business?

80
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,880
I don't see your basket!

81
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,640
Who eats all that now?

82
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,680
Only 'pissa', bread and 'burkur'!

83
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,240
I'm working now as a maid in
a textile shop owner's house

84
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,840
As soon as I go to work
they give me 'chandwich'!

85
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,080
Turn off your engine

86
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,440
What happened?

87
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,240
President of India is visiting our state

88
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,720
When did he come?

89
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,920
Didn't he call you?

90
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,240
You should read the newspaper

91
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,960
They even announced it on TV

92
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,440
So that's the reason for
traffic jam everywhere?

93
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:23,080
Who was standing next to you in
the passport office yesterday?

94
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,560
Was it your uncle?

95
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,200
What audacity!

96
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,880
He's my husband

97
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,320
If you want to attend an
interview apply for leave

98
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,120
To mark attendance as you please
this isn't the Govt Assembly!

99
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,160
Traffic jam all over the place

100
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,800
Roads were blocked, sir

101
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,520
It'll be like this until
the Metro project gets over

102
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,720
Maybe you can take off for 2 years!

103
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,640
What's worse is...

104
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,480
...you misspelt the
name in the certificate

105
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,880
You've changed male to female

106
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:13,960
And vice versa

107
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,240
That guy came this morning
and brought the roof down

108
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,320
You don't focus on your work at all

109
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:21,480
You pile up all the files on your
table and bury yourself into the heap

110
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,560
One of your colleagues
has complained about you

111
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,920
How can you be irresponsible
even in your mid 30s?

112
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,040
If I get any more complaints against you

113
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,800
You can leave now

114
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,280
'Must be that she-demon Rani!'

115
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,920
'I know how to deal with her'

116
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,240
Vasanthi...?

117
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,080
Don't come to me asking ½
an hour, 1 hour permission

118
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,080
Looks like I'll get
suspended because of you

119
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,440
The officer is a nice chap
So I had a narrow escape

120
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,280
Or else he would've taken my insides out

121
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,080
Okay, go

122
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,120
After you signed and stepped out...

123
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,600
...Rani sneaked in

124
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,480
I knew right away...

125
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,160
...she went in only
to get you into trouble

126
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,240
Of course, she holds a degree in Honesty

127
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,560
And a PhD in Sincerity!

128
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,800
I must open an account
in Facebook just for her

129
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,400
And post pictures of
her as Mrs Rip Van Winkle

130
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,200
Don't do all that

131
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,560
Then she'll retaliate

132
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,920
Today will be awesome for
me Someone said so on TV

133
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,160
What an awful day!

134
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,120
I drowned in that disastrous interview

135
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,320
And at work now I’m swimming in problems

136
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:43,320
Mithila's school closes ahead of time
She wanted me to pick her up today

137
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,440
I promised her I would

138
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,600
How can I go now?

139
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:48,160
From the office peon to
the Indian President...

140
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,080
...everyone is a problem for me!

141
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,840
Madam, he's been waiting to
see you since this morning

142
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:53,680
Poor soul...old man

143
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,840
Please attend to him

144
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,200
It is a good day for you

145
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,800
Problem has taken a new shape

146
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,440
Look into his case and send him

147
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,520
What can I do for you, sir?

148
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,120
For my daughter's wedding...

149
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,960
...in the marriage scheme
called Moovalur Ramamridham amma-

150
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,600
What?

151
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,680
For my daughter's wedding...

152
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:16,000
...under the marriage aid scheme

153
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:20,080
...I had applied for a loan

154
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,360
It's been a month

155
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,800
And I haven't got the amount as yet

156
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:27,240
It's still on the Tahsildar's table

157
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,880
I haven't got it as yet

158
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,720
You said exactly this last week too!

159
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,280
I'm not saying any differently now

160
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,560
You'll get it in another 2 days

161
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,880
Come on Wednesday

162
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,280
Glad to hear this

163
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,600
I'll take leave

164
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,080
What did you say your name was?

165
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,160
Jayachandran

166
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,440
Not the honest king
Harichandra I presume?

167
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,320
Aren't you new here?

168
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:01,040
For 14 years I've been vegetating here

169
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,200
This enquiry is related
to the department

170
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,520
Sir, I'm calling from the Revenue Dept

171
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:22,360
Regarding Vasanthi's case, I've
collected all the official details

172
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,240
I'll get the personal
details in another 2 hours

173
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,640
Why did you ask me to come here?

174
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,480
I'll explain later

175
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,720
Otherwise you'll be thrilled too soon

176
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,640
Come

177
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,080
Take a look at this, mom

178
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,160
From now on kohl to
your eyes alone won't do

179
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,880
You need glasses too

180
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,240
Shut up

181
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,920
Let's go sit in the last table

182
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,080
Who's that uncle bun?

183
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,240
He's calling me aunty!

184
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,440
My classmate

185
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,960
All those who are in the 35+
age group is aunty to us, mom

186
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,840
Do you address 35+ men as uncle?

187
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:18,720
If any man is 35+ we
won't even greet him!

188
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,880
I was kidding

189
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,440
What's this brochure about?

190
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,720
Hearing about our Ireland trip
Shanthi ma'am got it for me

191
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,720
The place we'll be living in
has 2 leading schools it seems

192
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,960
These are tuck shops

193
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,400
Like our school canteen

194
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,520
Students run it once a month

195
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:36,120
The profits are given
back to the students

196
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,440
So I won't be needing any pocket money

197
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,920
Whatever you spend on
me I'll save up and repay

198
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,240
You know what

199
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,640
Even at High school level
they are offering 3 streams

200
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,000
And most important-

201
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,840
I don't know if we will be
going together to Ireland!

202
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,640
It will be feasible only if
I get another job opportunity

203
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,640
I don't know when that will be

204
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,160
Because I was 1 year older
they rejected me today

205
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,600
Mithi...Mithi...?

206
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,640
Please pack this for me

207
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,720
I forgot to wish you at work

208
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,280
Oh! Today is her birthday

209
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,160
Those born on the 16th
will be lazy bums, sir

210
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,080
- Really?
- Yes, sir

211
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,520
Today is my birthday too

212
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,680
I wish today wasn't even my birthday

213
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,040
Today is the worst day of my life!

214
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,680
In today's interview you said...

215
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,520
...you didn't answer
some question properly

216
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,520
Yes...so what?

217
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,920
Rani claims it's a lie

218
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:17,320
You got rejected because you are old

219
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,120
She's busy spreading this rumor

220
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,680
She'll slip in her bathroom

221
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,560
And may both her front teeth break

222
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,800
It seems her cousin is
in the interview board

223
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,240
I believe he said you're above 40

224
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,960
So you can never go to Ireland!

225
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,480
She's telling this to the whole world

226
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,480
She's the one who is 40

227
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,520
40 plus, she's 47!

228
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,600
Visiting beauty parlors often
she looks 10 years younger

229
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,040
Even though not visible openly
you have plenty of silver hair

230
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:00,560
How did your hair grey
at so young an age?

231
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:04,000
That's what I don't know either

232
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:07,400
Food, tension etc are
some of the reasons

233
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:10,880
If you color your hair plus facial...

234
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,480
...10 years will disappear

235
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:16,120
"Come, my precious princess"

236
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:21,440
"With vigor as a youngster
let’s rise to the occasion, dear"

237
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,440
"Kick up your heels, no fear"

238
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,440
"Go get them, tiger"

239
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,280
Kumar, give me change for Rs 500

240
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,080
Buying ½ kilo carrot and ½ kilo tomato?

241
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,440
I grow them on my terrace

242
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,360
Give me coins

243
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,640
You can grow tomato and
eggplant in your terrace

244
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,240
Beans and carrots can be got
only in Ooty and Kodaikanal

245
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,440
Price of silver has declined

246
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,840
And gold has gone to your head

247
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,920
Money can disappear
Jewelry can be stolen

248
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,680
But for you, sis,
many years are missing!

249
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,600
Looking so young

250
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:17,960
"People will put you on a pedestal
Weigh you as 24 carat gold, girl"

251
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:21,200
"Lock, stock and barrel
They will lock you up, girl"

252
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,840
"You be your own protector"

253
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,200
Why are you late?

254
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,080
Got delayed at work

255
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,960
What happened to your Ireland trip?

256
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:34,960
It's being processed

257
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,160
Risky only if Scotland had separated

258
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,720
But now there's no problem

259
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,480
What happened?

260
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,920
These mosquitoes are a pest

261
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,360
If it is so crammed up, naturally
mosquitoes will bite you alive

262
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,400
Why is everything so dried up?

263
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,920
Aren't you watering the plants?

264
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,080
No time, sir

265
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,800
Mithila will water if
she's in a good mood

266
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:50,840
But she has also stopped

267
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:53,040
If you make time, you
won't have to buy vegetables

268
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,640
It has to be attended to

269
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,440
I know someone in the
agricultural office

270
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,400
Shall I send him?

271
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,080
(popular TV show)

272
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,480
Okay, we can chat later

273
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,800
'She's my daughter'

274
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,560
'I swear Trust me'

275
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,720
'To our neighbor Kavitha, I was
-'

276
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,360
He found out the kid is his?

277
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,560
Did Lakshmi tell him?

278
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,160
He overheard Lakshmi talking to Padmini

279
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,080
Then?

280
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:22,120
But he pretends he doesn't know

281
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,120
Can you reduce the volume?

282
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,160
Why should the whole
world hear this melodrama?

283
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,080
Can't even study in this house

284
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:32,120
She tossed her bag when
she got back from school

285
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,960
She kicked her shoes to this side

286
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,720
I asked her 'what happened'?
She said 'mind your business'!

287
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:40,520
If you don't pull her up, people
will only blame you for spoiling her

288
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,160
What's this?

289
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,120
Let me talk to her

290
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,480
I've completed 36

291
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,960
But it isn't my fault

292
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,960
There is something
called 'wheel of time'

293
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,560
But I'm not the one turning it!

294
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,840
Just because you sulk,
my age won't reduce

295
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,080
I was 23 when you were born

296
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,120
I am curious

297
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,480
You and your dad are gungho
about Ireland only now

298
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,120
If you had discovered
Ireland last year...

299
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,600
...these problems wouldn't have risen

300
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,280
You won't understand Stop lamenting, ma

301
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,440
Why are you screaming now?

302
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,120
Then...?

303
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,200
Only if you have a dream
will you know the pain...

304
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,440
...of someone else's
dream being shattered

305
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,720
At 13 what can you dream about?

306
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:26,080
In our days, few kids
will act beyond their age

307
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,240
But now internet is
grooming smart Alecs!

308
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,440
Look at my college autograph book

309
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,720
Do you know who wrote this?

310
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,600
Susan David, my best friend

311
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,880
She’s still on top of the rung

312
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:54,360
I've collected more medals and
certificates than you ever did

313
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,520
Want to see them?

314
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,880
You've shown them at least 500 times

315
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,320
Just dust them out in October as
thanksgiving to Goddess Saraswathi

316
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,480
I forfeited my dreams

317
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,600
For you to realize your dreams!

318
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,600
Oh! What a tremendous sacrifice!

319
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,840
You stand apart from all mothers

320
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,000
Those who want to achieve
will do so come what may

321
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,120
You were laid back then

322
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,600
And now blaming it on me coolly

323
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,120
I'm not blaming you

324
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,840
To follow all your dreams...

325
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,560
...I've given you enough freedom

326
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,120
But my mom didn't raise me that way!

327
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:28,240
Girls were brought up protectively
with lots of do's and don'ts

328
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,320
It was a different time altogether

329
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,960
If I had argued to my mom like you...

330
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,680
...a whole broomstick
would have landed on me!

331
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,840
Mom, please

332
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,720
If I talk to you, I'll become old

333
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,720
I must finish this project now

334
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,120
Ignore her

335
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,960
She must have yelled in a fit of anger

336
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Then...?

337
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:53,720
She's your daughter

338
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,960
Your genes, right?

339
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,080
She behaves more
like my mother-in-law!

340
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,520
This is really yummy

341
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,000
Why don't you also taste it?

342
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,440
What's this new habit?

343
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,080
I had the yummiest cake ever

344
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,000
What you are eating is
from our terrace garden!

345
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:11,240
20000 bucks for this salad?

346
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,080
You haven't commented
about my hair, dear

347
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,560
What happened to your hair?

348
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,000
Didn't you notice?

349
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,440
- Looks good
- Simply don't flatter!

350
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,160
Really, it is good

351
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,480
- Violet?
- No...red gold

352
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,440
You are looking good now

353
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:41,080
In case you don't like it I
got a remover from the parlor

354
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:43,120
Thanks, I'm happy now

355
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,080
Parent's day celebration
at Mithila's school tomorrow

356
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,840
I'll go there and make heads turn

357
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:48,920
Give them a royal sprain!

358
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:53,360
Hope you aren't mad with me for not
getting selected in the interview

359
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,360
Oprah Winfrey who earns
340 million today...

360
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,640
...failed her first 5 interviews too

361
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,080
Good gracious! 340 million?

362
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,040
Who is that?

363
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:06,240
A lady from Kattankulathur!

364
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,520
I'm so glad, she's from down south

365
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,840
I don't think I can go to Ireland

366
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,440
Why...what happened?

367
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,000
This morning I met with a minor accident

368
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,800
A school kid fell on my car

369
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,440
Hope the kid is safe

370
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,480
No worries

371
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,560
I rushed him to the hospital at once

372
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,480
Then what?

373
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,480
Worried if they will file a case

374
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:33,680
Then it may affect our visa process

375
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,600
Waited all these years for the visa

376
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,440
And just when I'm about to get it-

377
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,120
Do you mean an arrest warrant?

378
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,800
Nothing like that, I hope

379
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,240
No...it is covered by insurance

380
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,080
Shouldn't be any problem

381
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,520
Just tensed about the visa

382
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,600
If my dad had a driver's license...

383
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,920
...I can claim he was driving

384
00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:00,280
I struggled all these years
for us to have a better future

385
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:04,400
Luck seems to play hide and seek with us

386
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,440
What if I say I was driving?

387
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:09,920
No way

388
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,400
Let my license be of use at least now

389
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,640
It hasn't been of any use whatsoever

390
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,240
I just want you to be happy

391
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,240
Take care of your visa
without any hassles

392
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,880
Let me make a call

393
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,520
Hello Murthy...Tamil

394
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,280
Let us proceed as planned

395
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,320
Vasanthi doesn't have a problem

396
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:39,560
But make sure she doesn't
have any other problems

397
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:41,720
Okay

398
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,520
Why are you here?

399
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,680
Nothing...who was on the phone?

400
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,680
My colleague

401
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,640
Called to wish me for my birthday!

402
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:51,840
Happ-

403
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,040
Come, let's eat

404
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,360
'All India Radio, Chennai'

405
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:04,200
'You just listened to our
Prime Minister's address...'

406
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:08,880
'...on a campaign to Clean
India, creating an awareness'

407
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:13,080
'...among the people
for the Chennai Marathon'

408
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,840
'This will be followed
by the regional news'

409
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:27,240
Sir, I got a call from
T.Nagar traffic police station

410
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:30,080
They've given me a number
asking you to contact them

411
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,960
'Good afternoon All India Radio'

412
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,560
'Yes, sir?'

413
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,560
Hello, this is Tamil selvan here

414
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:40,520
Someone from the station
asked me to call this number

415
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,840
Yes, sir

416
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,560
Okay

417
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:03,520
Clear the traffic jam at once from
South Usman road up to Boag road

418
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,080
President is arriving at Raj
Bhavan at 4 p.m sharp, over

419
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,240
Finished writing?

420
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:08,480
Just need your signature

421
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,600
Mr Stephen?

422
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,720
He is over there

423
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,280
- Sir?
- What?

424
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,360
I am Tamil selvan, sir

425
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,120
Go fast

426
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,440
Why keep staring at his mouth?

427
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,080
Is anyone frying fritters there?

428
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,320
I'm Tamil selvan

429
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,720
That accident case?

430
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:21,600
Who is that?

431
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,800
My wife

432
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,360
Who is this?

433
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,440
That's me, sir

434
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,640
Do you recognize yourself?

435
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,800
This photo was taken
when you were a teenager!

436
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,480
2 years since it expired!

437
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,600
Where was he when the accident happened?

438
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,560
I was in the car, sir

439
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,760
Who cooks at home?

440
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:37,640
Me, sir

441
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:38,680
Housewife?

442
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:41,200
work in the revenue department

443
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,480
So you work, drive and also cook?

444
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,600
Then what does he do?

445
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,120
Sir, I work for All India Radio

446
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,760
I'm inspector Ramamurthy's-

447
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,520
Friend?

448
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:51,440
That reporter is known to everybody here

449
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:54,400
Madam, this is recorded
as a case, RTI crime

450
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,280
According to our law, the offender
can be put behind bars for 3 years

451
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,720
Press, media, court
will hound you from now

452
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,080
On your part, you can
announce this as news

453
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,880
Traffic is blocked on
Venkat Narayana road

454
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,960
2 cars have been parked
in the 'No Parking' area

455
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,240
Recovery van has been sent

456
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:12,080
Attend to that first, Stephen

457
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,240
I didn't know about the expiry!

458
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,480
What do you know?

459
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,080
I referred your name

460
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,560
But he didn't respond

461
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,440
That isn't the problem now, Murthy

462
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:31,480
My wife's license expired 2 years ago

463
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,400
Yes, I realize It is a problem

464
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:37,120
I think it's better to have
a lawyer move it in court!

465
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,720
Birth date?

466
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,400
Who knows?

467
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,960
Madam's horoscope has one date

468
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,680
Another date in her school records

469
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,880
A different date in
her school certificate

470
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,440
She herself doesn't
know when she was born!

471
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:53,360
Now she has colored her
hair to join 12th grade!

472
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:58,120
Until this case gets over...

473
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:01,040
...I can't even travel
as a tourist anywhere

474
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,920
I've given up my Ireland idea

475
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:41,800
Trying to take revenge on me because
I'm going to Ireland without you?

476
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:42,600
Oh no!

477
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:44,960
Don't tell me you didn't know?

478
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,240
I swear I didn't know

479
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,920
After I got my license,
I haven't even touched it

480
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:51,560
Didn't you verify it when
you gave the license to me?

481
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,720
I swear I didn't know
a license can expire!

482
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,920
Repeating the phrase 'I
don't know' so often...

483
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:00,160
...you're the only person in this
world I know who leads a cushy life

484
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,600
I shouldn't go abroad

485
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,240
I should just eat whatever you serve

486
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,520
And keep staring at your face

487
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,320
And stagnate

488
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,440
Are you happy now?

489
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,240
All these years, have
I ever said 'no' to you?

490
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:11,080
Or refused to do anything for you?

491
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,880
When you told me about the Ireland trip…

492
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,040
…I said it won't be nice to
leave your aged parents here alone

493
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,440
Didn't I suggest you should go alone?

494
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,040
How can you say this?

495
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,440
Don't I want us to lead a happy life?

496
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,600
Of course…!

497
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,960
You should buy a more
expensive sari than Rani

498
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:28,520
After office hours, you must
eat 'pav bhaji' with Girija

499
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,080
When you ramble all this to me…

500
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,560
…I must listen with a fake smile!

501
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,160
I have a long list of grievances

502
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,160
You don't like me, right?

503
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,400
Because of you, I don't like myself

504
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,840
Leading a good life means
something else to me!

505
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:47,800
Gobble breakfast at
7:00 a.m in a hurry-burry

506
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,640
Cook lunch in the morning
and stuff it into a box

507
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,680
At night eat 4 'rotis' and
end of routine for the day

508
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:56,080
Looking forward to 1 Sunday...

509
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,920
...should I die a lifetime?

510
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,960
I want a nice house in a good area

511
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:06,080
I'd like our child to grow
up in a good atmosphere

512
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,800
We should have good neighbors

513
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:10,320
All other wives tell
their spouses how to dress

514
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,200
If the announcement
or voice modulation...

515
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:15,160
...isn't up to the mark,
they give tips to improve

516
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:17,360
They discuss about their future together

517
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,360
I don't have any of that

518
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,840
No politics, sports or literature

519
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,520
I must get back home on time

520
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,400
If I get delayed...

521
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,960
...I get 4 messages and 7 phone calls

522
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:26,960
And for what joy?

523
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,560
To talk of onion price that has shot up

524
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,960
Or slump in the price of tomato

525
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,560
Or to pay the school fees

526
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,040
And this sums up my life!

527
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,960
You are telling me all this
after 14 years of being married

528
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:42,040
Did I do all this for my happiness?

529
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,640
I feel it is my duty to take
good care of my parents-in-law

530
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:45,880
What I cooked yesterday...

531
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:48,680
...what I'll cook tomorrow
or today is a big deal for me!

532
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,240
For families on a shoestring budget…

533
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,920
…price of vegetables
will matter big time

534
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,080
If I add 1 extra chilli...

535
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,120
or 1 extra spoon of salt…

536
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,760
…your plate flies like a frisbee, no?

537
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,320
You want me to appoint a cook now?

538
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,160
No need…let us order from a hotel

539
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,920
Hereafter you need not cook

540
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,800
Are you being reasonable?

541
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:07,160
I have desires and dreams too

542
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:09,840
Dreams?

543
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,120
And what is your dream?

544
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,240
Not the dream people get if
they close their eyes and sleep

545
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:18,200
It's the vision of the future
you feel when you shut your eyes

546
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,440
If you want such dreams...

547
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,320
...you must have minimum qualifications

548
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,520
Such feelings can't happen to this face

549
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,560
For God's sake, pick it up

550
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,320
Hello…?

551
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,120
Yes

552
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,080
What?

553
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,040
When?

554
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:39,840
Okay

555
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,160
Someone spoke from the
Commissioner's office

556
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,400
They want me to come
at 10:00 a.m tomorrow

557
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,560
You go by yourself

558
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,600
I can't come

559
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,080
I have some other work

560
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,520
Why are you late?

561
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,440
What happened?

562
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,600
Everything is solved

563
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,760
No problem!

564
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:04,080
My wife has gone to bed
with a splitting headache

565
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,600
She has made 'rotis' for you both

566
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,920
Earlier you eat easier to digest

567
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:07,720
Okay

568
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:18,080
If they question me...

569
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,200
...I won't even know what to say

570
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,680
I'm so scared already

571
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,360
Come with me, please

572
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,120
Haven't you eaten as yet?

573
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,560
What are you doing here?

574
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,360
Any problem, son?

575
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:38,640
I must go to the Commissioner's office
tomorrow regarding the accident case

576
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,240
But I'm very scared to go by myself

577
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,560
Why should you go alone?

578
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:42,840
Where is sir going?

579
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,120
Is she a kid for me to hold her hand?

580
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,080
She can handle it

581
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,080
Dad, you go to bed

582
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:48,400
She isn't attending a wedding

583
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,920
She's going to the police station

584
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,280
You committed the crime

585
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,280
I'll go with you, dear

586
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,440
As if I don't know!

587
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,080
Dad, please go

588
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,720
How can you talk without any conscience?

589
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:00,480
Her parents aren't alive

590
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,120
That's the problem

591
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,560
Not having parents is her problem

592
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:04,960
My problem is I have parents!

593
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:07,240
Dad, this is my personal life

594
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,280
Don't interfere

595
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,240
Please go

596
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,560
I have an appointment
with the commissioner

597
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:47,480
You are...?

598
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,240
Wait over there

599
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:11,120
What's your program day after tomorrow?

600
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,440
It's a working day, sir

601
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,960
I'll attend office

602
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,280
Other than that…?

603
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,760
Nothing else, sir

604
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:22,080
You don't have to attend
office on that day!

605
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,280
We'll ensure you are not marked absent

606
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:37,520
Is Mithila your daughter?

607
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,520
Yes, sir

608
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:42,960
2 days ago in a school function…

609
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:46,720
…Mithila asked a question to
one of the VIP chief guests

610
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,400
Instead of answering her question…

611
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,280
…he asked Mithila who
taught her this question

612
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,560
She replied 'my mom'!

613
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:57,920
Wanting to honor you…

614
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:00,520
…he has invited you as his special guest

615
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,400
Day after tomorrow at 8:00 a.m…

616
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:19,400
…President is meeting you at
the Taj hotel for breakfast!

617
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,240
(sigh of relief)

618
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,880
You'll be invited formally

619
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:29,320
Official vehicles will come to
your house tomorrow at 4:00 p.m

620
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,960
For security reasons you may have
to stay at the Taj tomorrow night

621
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,760
You can ask a family member
to be with you if you like

622
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:39,080
But the President will meet only you

623
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:46,720
Sir, regarding an accident case
Inspector at T.Nagar police station...

624
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,800
...has asked me to come
at 5:00 p.m tomorrow

625
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,440
We know about that case

626
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:53,640
In another few hours that case
will be settled down completely

627
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,080
We'll handle it

628
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:00,200
If there's anything else,
you should let us know

629
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,720
Did you hear what he said properly?

630
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,200
He isn't the local president, right?

631
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:20,760
Will the commissioner call her
to meet the village president?

632
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,960
Dumbwit of the first order!

633
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:24,120
So you didn't teach her
what she asked the President?

634
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,120
I didn't even know he
was visiting her school!

635
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:29,280
Or you might have taught
Mithila some riddle

636
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,640
And she would've asked
the same riddle to him

637
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,120
He must have been stumped

638
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,040
Who...the President of India?

639
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:35,680
You are-

640
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,680
Anyway this matter
will leak out very soon

641
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,880
This street will be
swarming with the Press

642
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,720
Can I also be with you
during the interview?

643
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,680
For what?

644
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:45,760
I've been watching TV
for the past 40 years

645
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,080
When will I come on TV?

646
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:49,360
Commissioner has told me
not to give any interviews

647
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,800
Even if I did, I don't
know what Mithila asked him

648
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:52,720
Correct

649
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:55,400
Mithila will be back
from school anytime now

650
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,640
This is Rashtrapati Bhavan,
President's residence

651
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:58,600
Wow…!

652
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:01,440
His own house or is it rented?

653
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,840
It is given by the Govt

654
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,160
How's that possible?

655
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:07,240
A nominal sum has to be paid as rent
even if it's Govt's quarters, right?

656
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,880
I feel like drinking tea made by you

657
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,280
Please oblige

658
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,240
Go

659
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,280
When I was at school,
during our school tour…

660
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,240
…I've seen Rashtrapati
Bhavan from a distance

661
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,720
But they refused to let us in

662
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,680
President himself is
now coming to see you

663
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:23,240
By the way, who's going with you?

664
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,280
I'm not going

665
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,520
He just has to eat breakfast by himself!

666
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:30,560
If you don't go, he'll send
the Black cat security here

667
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,520
Should I send you also
inside to make tea?

668
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,880
Adding fuel to the fire!

669
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:38,480
Among the total Indian population,
only 10 will get this opportunity

670
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,920
Please don't miss this, dear

671
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,360
But that question?

672
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,360
That-

673
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:56,040
What question did you ask the
President of India, my dear?

674
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,080
Tell me, Mithi

675
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,920
President wants to see me in person

676
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,080
Hey Mithi!

677
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,080
First pack up your anger

678
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,840
And tell me what you asked him

679
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:36,800
Okay, let's both not talk to each other

680
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,760
But just tell me what you asked him

681
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,840
Otherwise I'll tell the President
I never asked such a question

682
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,360
And Mithila was the one who asked

683
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,640
Then what will you do?

684
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:50,520
I never lied

685
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:53,080
I can prove it is my mom's question

686
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:55,840
Okay, truce

687
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:59,440
I'll talk to the President and make
arrangements for you go to Ireland!

688
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,920
Tell me what you asked him

689
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:05,920
You're 13 years old

690
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,360
Don't know how to plait your hair

691
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,800
Or how to iron your uniform

692
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,760
Next time when you come to me,
I'll iron your face, just watch!

693
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:15,440
Why you were born to me is my question?

694
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:45,280
Didn't you ask the President
the question I told you?

695
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,400
School rejected it

696
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:57,160
Where did I keep that? Can't remember!

697
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:03,880
Take a look at this

698
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:09,120
Remember the saree worn by Vani
in that 'Vani Rani' Tamil serial!

699
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:11,480
How are you?

700
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,880
- Teacher, how are you?
- I'm on top of the world

701
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,520
Saw you on TV Very happy!

702
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:18,960
My throat went hoarse, telling
everyone you're my student!

703
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,840
Are you also tired now?

704
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,040
No one will believe
me if I say I met you

705
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,280
Shall we take a snap together?

706
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,160
Can you please click a snap of us?

707
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,080
My
daughter-in-law!

708
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,520
Aren't you Vasanthi ma'am?

709
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:43,080
Yes

710
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:45,560
Can we also take a photo with you?

711
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,040
Okay

712
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,080
Deepa, come

713
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:52,080
Go stand there My
daughter-in-law!

714
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,640
What was your question?

715
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,280
Show me the picture

716
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:02,120
That's suspense for security reasons

717
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,120
Who is that?

718
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:08,160
Past 1 hour she has emptied
the shelf of all the sarees

719
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,840
And is busy taking photos!

720
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:12,160
Tulasi'ma, call the shop boy

721
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,400
Sir, I know her

722
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:16,920
Our President has
invited her to meet him

723
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,640
It came in the papers and on TV

724
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:20,240
- Is that right?
- Yes, sir

725
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,920
This is way above my league

726
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,960
Anyway it's just a photo

727
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,080
No problem

728
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:27,800
Hey Vasanthi!

729
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,440
Girija, where are you?

730
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:31,840
I am on the way to the canteen!

731
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:34,120
You got a day off and
you're living it up

732
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,320
Where's Mrs Pickle face?

733
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,520
Who…Rani?

734
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:39,640
She went to the canteen

735
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,640
Go there right now

736
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:41,440
Why?

737
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:44,960
Go fast and talk about me meeting
the President within her earshot

738
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:52,080
Vasanthi, what's the sari color?

739
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:54,600
Idiot! Talk about the President

740
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,240
Did the President himself talk to you?

741
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,160
Oh my god!

742
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,120
He's invited you for
lunch with your family?

743
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,920
You're one hell of a lucky woman

744
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,200
She'll die a million deaths

745
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,280
Excellent! Keep raving

746
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:04,440
Lucky devil!

747
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:07,720
You are meeting the President,
seeing the Governor on the same day

748
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:11,080
I think you'll be promoted as
Junior superintendent this year!

749
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:12,720
Please keep me in mind too

750
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:13,800
If you do such a good job…

751
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,560
…looks like I'll myself
die a million deaths!

752
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:18,120
By now she must have become
tear jerker 'Love story' part 2!

753
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:20,040
How I wish I could see her now

754
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:22,960
What…cops are all around your house?

755
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,480
You're too too good

756
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:27,280
I'll gift you at least a
pair of ear studs, Girija

757
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,280
Governor's meeting is only on Friday

758
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:36,360
Because after meeting the President
on Thursday, a dinner will be hosted

759
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,320
There's a half page write
up in the Tamil paper

760
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,560
Didn't you read it?

761
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,960
I'm simple as always!

762
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:43,920
Even now I'm travelling only by bus

763
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:47,160
- Ma'am, you can sit
- That's okay

764
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:49,160
No, please sit down

765
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:56,920
Girija, I haven't met
the President as yet

766
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,720
And I'm the center of attention

767
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:02,760
After my meeting, papers and
TV will give me full coverage

768
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:06,280
Only Black cats security
for me after that

769
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,360
Sir, it's getting late

770
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:13,440
Please check

771
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,040
Everyone is waiting outside for you

772
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:21,800
Come fast

773
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:30,640
I'm begging you one last time

774
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:31,760
I'm very tensed

775
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:33,600
Tell me at least now

776
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:37,200
Only in my womb, you were my daughter

777
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:39,320
After that you've grown
as a son to your dad

778
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:41,040
Continue to be like this forever

779
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,320
Good morning, sister

780
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:12,640
Call me after you reach

781
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:16,600
- See you
- Take care

782
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,120
What kind of hotel is this!

783
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,040
Normally they keep
only milk in the fridge

784
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:53,480
But feels like we are in a fridge too

785
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:54,960
I'm shivering from head to toe

786
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:02,760
It seems tender mango
pickle and homemade toffee...

787
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:05,240
...are the President's favorites
I read it in the newspaper

788
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,000
Tell him I made it specially for him

789
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,440
Block that area completely

790
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:27,840
We don't know the President's mindset

791
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:29,720
Be crisp and short in what you speak

792
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:32,360
This is…?

793
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:33,440
Homemade candy

794
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,800
My mother-in-law
made for the President

795
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:48,720
Homemade toffee

796
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:50,440
No…no It’s okay

797
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:47,640
'Namasthe'

798
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:05,680
'All India Radio, Chennai
News read by Tamil selvan'

799
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:11,160
'Mrs Vasanthi Tamil selvan who met the
President at the Taj hotel yesterday…'

800
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:14,720
'…fainted due to high blood pressure'

801
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:22,360
his must be 1st time after your wedding…

802
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:23,800
...you are bowing your head

803
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:24,760
Keep quiet!

804
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:27,320
Covering up like this
will only shield your face

805
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:29,880
But your news is all over the place

806
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:31,200
Don't snatch my dignity away

807
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:33,720
How else can I have a dig at you?!

808
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:41,480
You have to get down
only in the next stop

809
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:51,160
I want to go to the Collector's office

810
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:52,040
It's right here

811
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:53,640
Will take you 2 minutes by walk

812
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:55,480
I've hurt my foot

813
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:56,760
Please drop me there

814
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:57,840
Okay, get in

815
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:11,440
But tell me this, if you faint
only your head will be hurt!

816
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:13,080
How did you hurt your foot?
00:04:30:0 00:04:31:10 (snigger)

817
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:21,400
Here

818
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:48,960
What are you doing here?

819
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,400
Is everyone there
waiting to make fun of me?

820
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:52,920
I won't say 'no'

821
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,840
Oh God! I feel so ashamed

822
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:56,400
Tell me what happened

823
00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:00,160
Don't ask me the torture
I had to go through

824
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:02,040
As if they were arresting a murderer...

825
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:04,000
...they took me the previous day itself

826
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:06,240
There isn't any limit to
my mother-in-law's antics

827
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:09,240
Will anyone insist on packing
'kamarkat' for the President?

828
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:10,920
They checked me like I was a terrorist

829
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:12,960
And the toffee as if it was a bomb!

830
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:14,720
Then 4 demons landed

831
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:17,120
'Sit, stand, don't turn, don't breathe'

832
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:19,400
They tortured me with
such clipped commands

833
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:21,200
Pindrop silence

834
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:24,240
Suddenly a man announced
the President's arrival

835
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:25,200
...in a thundering voice

836
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:27,360
And pushed me to and
fro like a road roller

837
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:32,000
Alibaba's door opens

838
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:35,640
Some more demons joined
the burly men around me

839
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:38,640
My eyes closed slightly

840
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:40,200
But poor President!

841
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:42,280
Don't know what happened to him

842
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:47,080
But when I saw him last,
he seemed hazy to me

843
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:48,640
I open my eyes

844
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:49,840
I'm in hospital

845
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:54,160
Anyone will faint if
this is what happened

846
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:57,800
In Indian history this is the first time

847
00:49:57,880 --> 00:49:59,320
So Mithila told me

848
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,320
Let's go

849
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:08,040
I'm feeling self conscious

850
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:10,840
No one pays you to be
self-conscious or shy

851
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:12,040
Keep feeling shy and work

852
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:13,840
Look! Even you're making fun

853
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:15,200
Okay, I'll handle them

854
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:18,840
Are you on Facebook?

855
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:19,760
No, I am not

856
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:21,560
Then your life isn't in any danger

857
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:24,120
Sign and come in

858
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:51,680
Then 174/18 Where is that?

859
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:00,360
This land document is under
a different survey number

860
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:02,680
Check this record properly

861
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:05,120
We have received a circular
from our higher office

862
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:07,240
All offices should make
provisions from now on...

863
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:09,680
...for a First aid box
and emergency kit it seems

864
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:10,280
Why?

865
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:11,920
Orders from the President!

866
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:13,640
It has been uploaded even on Youtube

867
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:16,920
It seems those who are weak should
wear a helmet without feeling shy

868
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:19,800
He is our President

869
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:20,720
Elderly gentleman

870
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:22,840
Falling at his feet to take
his blessings isn't wrong

871
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:24,920
But not getting up is wrong!

872
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:26,320
(jeering laughter)

873
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:30,440
Prime minister Vajpayee fell at the feet of
Mrs Chinnapillai 00:07:55:2 00:07:56:15 Why?

874
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:33,160
Watch it on Youtube

875
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:34,800
Share it in Facebook

876
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:38,200
50% of you just sit and doze
after lunch in a half-coma stage

877
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:39,640
Why do we need a First aid kit?

878
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:41,400
I'll call 108 for the ambulance!

879
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:51,440
Mithi, if you don't tell me
what's wrong how can I help you?

880
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:52,320
What happened?

881
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:54,440
Not saying a word she
has been crying nonstop

882
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:55,320
Why, my dear?

883
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:57,640
Only if we know we can help

884
00:51:57,800 --> 00:51:59,120
This is how in that serial-

885
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:00,480
Will you keep quiet?

886
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:02,480
Forever harping on TV serials and soaps

887
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:05,360
Let me ask Seshma

888
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:06,640
No need to ask anyone

889
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:07,800
I won't go to school

890
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:08,640
That's all

891
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:10,880
Shouldn't talk to your mom like this

892
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:13,800
When my friends see me,
they pretend to faint

893
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:15,160
I feel terrible

894
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:17,480
Okay, don't cry

895
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:19,720
I'll come and complain to your Principal

896
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:20,720
Please don't bother

897
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:22,880
'Vasanthi's dizzy spell' is
the most visited page in Fb

898
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:24,320
Whom will you complain to about it?

899
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:25,560
Record number of 'likes'

900
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:26,880
Log in and see for yourself

901
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:28,920
Everyone wants to know…

902
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:30,640
...if I'm going to
Ireland by train or bus!

903
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:32,240
Everyone is so proud of their mom

904
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:33,960
You are the only one humiliating me

905
00:52:56,920 --> 00:52:59,240
If she is so sensitive
about a Facebook page…

906
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:02,080
…how will she face
real problems in life?

907
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:05,960
Looks like Facebook will decide
how people must lead their lives

908
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:16,560
My darling mom!

909
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:19,240
What is it?

910
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:20,960
I'm taking you out for dinner

911
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:21,880
Get dressed

912
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:34,840
- What is this flavor?
- Death by chocolate

913
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:35,960
Death?

914
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:38,480
Violence has crept even into ice creams!

915
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:39,840
When I was in school...

916
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:41,680
...we had only popsicles
and vanilla ice pops

917
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:43,520
And eat secretly without
telling our parents

918
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:45,720
If they knew, our backs
got bruised black and blue

919
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:48,320
I can't finish this Will you share some?

920
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:49,800
Oh no! I don't want

921
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:53,040
Eat what you can, the rest
I'll lick to the last spoonful

922
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:56,240
I'll go and take a look
at the fish tank over there

923
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:01,040
Watch your step

924
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:07,040
Were you also teased in
your office because of me?

925
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:14,080
We are going to Ireland

926
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:19,040
'We' means?

927
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:21,440
Mithila and I

928
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:28,120
She has to write a test

929
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:29,640
She'll clear it with ease

930
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:31,960
Since her school
records are impressive...

931
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,960
...she won't have
hassles about admission

932
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:37,640
I have found a 2 bedroom
apartment close to school

933
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:41,240
Computer programmers
aren't in demand over there

934
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:43,480
I might have to struggle
a bit in the beginning

935
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:44,720
But doesn't matter

936
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,840
Besides, we can't leave
my parents alone here

937
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:49,760
Let's wait for a while

938
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:54,400
If I get a better placement
or if you can get a job...

939
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:56,560
...I'll take you with me

940
00:54:57,480 --> 00:54:58,520
When will that be?

941
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:00,640
One year?

942
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:02,760
2 years?

943
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:05,840
Till I don't know when...

944
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:09,200
...I should simply go
to work and come back

945
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:10,880
And then?

946
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:13,760
Your parents are healthy enough

947
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:17,120
My world revolves around
you and my daughter

948
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:19,880
I'm not standing in the
way of anyone's dream

949
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:21,400
Without Mithi in my life...

950
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:23,520
...I can't even imagine being here

951
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:28,160
She's too young to understand

952
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:31,360
As her mom, she needs me

953
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:33,720
I need her too

954
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:35,880
You isn't as dependent
as you think she is

955
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:37,200
She'll manage everything

956
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:39,880
She spoke to me in a mature manner

957
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:46,440
Anyway she'll be staying with me

958
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:48,920
Such a golden opportunity shouldn't be-

959
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:50,680
For a 13 year old,
more than opportunity...

960
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:52,680
...there are many more
necessities as priority

961
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:58,440
She may not understand what I need
to tell or do for her as a mother

962
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:01,160
But don't you understand either?

963
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:04,000
You may be a good father

964
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:08,600
But you can never step
into a mother's shoes

965
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:13,840
Vasanthi, move with the times
Not stick to old sentiments

966
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:15,360
Be practical

967
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:17,360
'Family' means parents
and child being together

968
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:19,200
When did that become old sentiment?

969
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:23,800
If life is only about
International school and syllabus...

970
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:26,120
…my daughter doesn't need that

971
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:28,240
My daughter should be with me

972
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,960
I knew you will stick to your
viewpoint and not budge an inch

973
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:36,320
She is dying to study there

974
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:38,760
As her dad I should
make her dream come true

975
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:41,000
If I leave her behind now...

976
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:42,640
...what if something happens to her?

977
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:46,360
I will ensure nothing untoward happens

978
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:49,120
I'm not sure of that

979
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:53,080
Trapped within 4 walls, I don't
want her becoming another 'Vasanthi'

980
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:54,760
hat's why I'm taking her with me

981
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:58,320
Not stagnate watching the same old faces

982
00:56:58,400 --> 00:56:59,880
r be a slave to tradition

983
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:01,200
Let her have exposure

984
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:03,360
See and live in a different world

985
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:05,480
Let go of her

986
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:20,960
Study well

987
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:24,320
Do your work yourself
instead of troubling dad

988
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:27,200
It will be an unfamiliar place

989
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:31,040
New schoolmates, neighbors
you'll meet and befriend

990
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:35,160
Irrespective of what anyone tells you...

991
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:37,040
...always check with your dad first

992
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:40,480
Confide in your dad
however trivial it may be

993
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:42,200
Listen only to him

994
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:49,080
No one else on earth will
want the best for you...

995
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:50,880
...other than your parents

996
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:56,440
No one else

997
00:57:57,840 --> 00:57:59,040
Don't worry, mom

998
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:01,080
I've downloaded Viber, Vonage

999
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:02,760
10 different apps on your phone

1000
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:05,600
I'll call you everyday
after I get home from school

1001
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:07,640
It will be 10:30 p.m here

1002
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:08,680
You'll be in bed

1003
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:10,800
I'll talk to you till you fall asleep

1004
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:13,040
Whatever it is I'll ask only you

1005
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:17,120
Wherever I may live
I'm your daughter, mom

1006
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:18,600
That can never change

1007
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:33,680
I'll call as soon as we land

1008
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:35,280
Come

1009
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:48,480
Don't worry about us

1010
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:49,800
We will manage

1011
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:52,640
But don't leave Vasanthi
alone here for too long

1012
00:58:57,560 --> 00:58:59,720
Shall I tell you that question now, ma?

1013
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:02,120
No, it's okay

1014
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,480
She has special class today

1015
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:44,880
Please pick her up on
your way back from work

1016
00:59:56,440 --> 00:59:57,760
I must go to Ireland

1017
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:00,480
I don't know how

1018
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:04,880
But I have to go for my daughter's sake

1019
01:00:06,040 --> 01:00:09,480
I've lived for my husband
and daughter for 14 long years

1020
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:12,640
By telling everyone my husband
and daughter are abroad...

1021
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:17,000
…I can't stay here by myself
even for a single day, Girija

1022
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:22,360
Parents generally ask
'where did you go?'

1023
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:24,640
Friends usually say 'long time no see'

1024
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:26,680
But you ask the wife

1025
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:30,320
'He got up only at 10:00 a.m,
and didn't even have breakfast'

1026
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:32,960
'He said he'll be back home
for lunch after 2:00 p.m'

1027
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:34,480
She'll narrate by the hour!

1028
01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:37,120
Every wife is a witness to her husband

1029
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:39,840
I also wanted to be that kind of a wife

1030
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:43,200
And bear testimony to my husband's life

1031
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:44,440
Even if he didn't like it!

1032
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:47,720
Mithila feels ashamed to call me her mom

1033
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:50,680
He's embarrassed to
introduce me as his wife!

1034
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:54,320
I don't know what I
have done with my life

1035
01:00:55,960 --> 01:00:58,200
But I've always been true to everyone

1036
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:05,880
My daughter shouldn't be like me

1037
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:09,840
She shouldn't become another 'Vasanthi'

1038
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:11,640
He said this and took her away

1039
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:16,880
I should've fallen dead
when he said those words

1040
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:25,840
Vasanthi…?

1041
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:33,560
Then what was Vasanthi to him?

1042
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:36,680
What is she in that house today?

1043
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:40,040
I feel ashamed, Girija

1044
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:44,800
I lost myself only because I
thought my family was there for me

1045
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:47,600
But now I have no one

1046
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:51,560
I must find myself!

1047
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:55,200
Everyone told me

1048
01:01:55,240 --> 01:01:56,480
Even Mithila told me

1049
01:01:56,560 --> 01:01:57,840
To check out Facebook

1050
01:01:57,880 --> 01:01:59,200
I want to see it now

1051
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:02,480
Why do you want to rake that now?

1052
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:03,600
Just leave it

1053
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:06,200
How can it get any worse?

1054
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:09,000
Show me the comments

1055
01:02:33,080 --> 01:02:36,840
'Vasanthi, are you a
servant or a Govt servant?'

1056
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:37,960
'How terrible'

1057
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,120
'This is the real ritual
of falling at one's feet'

1058
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:41,240
'Welcome, Tamilian lady'

1059
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:43,240
'Vasanthi, the President is on TV'

1060
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:44,240
'Switch it off'

1061
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:47,000
'10 million people in Tamil Nadu
drink and are steady on their feet'

1062
01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:48,920
'But why did you faint, Vasanthi?'

1063
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:53,720
Is this Vasanthi Chellamuthu
of 1998 Economics batch?'

1064
01:02:54,040 --> 01:02:55,440
'I don't think so'

1065
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:57,120
'It can't be our Vasanthi'

1066
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:11,480
Collector wants to see you

1067
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:22,240
He came only 10 minutes ago

1068
01:03:22,280 --> 01:03:23,880
There's a lady officer inside his cabin

1069
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:26,080
We've never seen her in
the department before!

1070
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:27,200
Maybe it's an enquiry

1071
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:30,360
Or will they ask her to
demonstrate how she fainted?

1072
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:31,880
Collector is in there

1073
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:32,960
So pipe down

1074
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:46,000
Susan...?!

1075
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:48,760
She's my college mate

1076
01:03:52,360 --> 01:03:54,120
Luckily, she's my friend too

1077
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:56,720
Dress code in our
college was a big issue

1078
01:03:56,800 --> 01:04:01,040
20 of us were suspended
for 15 days during exams

1079
01:04:01,120 --> 01:04:04,960
One who fought with the Principal
and made us go back to our class...

1080
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:06,120
…was this Vasanthi!

1081
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:09,000
Only after this episode,
I became her friend

1082
01:04:09,080 --> 01:04:12,800
In fact, she was my inspiration

1083
01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:34,600
I must catch up with
14 years of our lives

1084
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:37,200
I have lots to ask
and even more to share

1085
01:04:50,320 --> 01:04:51,200
Who is that?

1086
01:04:51,240 --> 01:04:52,440
What are you doing here?

1087
01:04:53,120 --> 01:04:54,440
Leave this place at once

1088
01:04:55,960 --> 01:04:57,000
Should we leave at once?

1089
01:04:57,040 --> 01:04:58,320
Outsiders are not allowed inside

1090
01:04:58,360 --> 01:05:00,600
Leave the premises now Or
I'll complain to the Principal

1091
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:02,160
Okay, go and complain

1092
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:07,320
Susan, why get into trouble?

1093
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:09,280
He might actually complain

1094
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:18,280
'We'll fight…we'll protest'

1095
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:21,040
'Dress code is our wish'

1096
01:05:22,040 --> 01:05:24,760
We'll fight…we'll protest

1097
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:27,720
Dress code is our wish

1098
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:31,160
Dress code is our right

1099
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:38,080
In our college none of us
dress in a vulgar manner

1100
01:05:38,120 --> 01:05:40,400
Nor do we pass hurtful comments

1101
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:42,480
We take everything sportively

1102
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:46,720
If their sister or mother's sari
slips or slides unexpectedly...

1103
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:49,960
…or if their dress is transparent
how will they react, sir?

1104
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,880
They should be the ones to learn
to behave without differentiating

1105
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:55,800
Dress won't make someone
a celebrity or a nonentity

1106
01:05:55,880 --> 01:05:58,600
We cannot accept this dress code, sir

1107
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:00,920
Where is that Vasanthi?

1108
01:06:03,600 --> 01:06:04,520
I don't know

1109
01:06:06,040 --> 01:06:07,000
I must search for her

1110
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:12,160
I thought this is
life and bent backwards

1111
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:14,280
Now I'm completely broken, Susan

1112
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:15,840
Is this Vasanthi talking?

1113
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:19,840
I can't think of any student
who didn't glorify you then

1114
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:22,320
I didn't possess half your caliber

1115
01:06:22,360 --> 01:06:25,160
But I watched you and wanted
to study and behave like you!

1116
01:06:25,240 --> 01:06:26,800
I took you as my inspiration

1117
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:30,200
And I'm the Chief Marketing Officer
in a multinational corporation now

1118
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:33,640
What happened to you?

1119
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:35,520
I can't-

1120
01:06:35,720 --> 01:06:39,480
Don't tell me clichés like 'I
lived for my family and kids'

1121
01:06:40,520 --> 01:06:44,360
Even a mother who feeds her kids
selflessly and goes to bed hungry...

1122
01:06:44,440 --> 01:06:46,960
…is sent to an Old age
home by the very same kids

1123
01:06:47,040 --> 01:06:48,600
It's a selfish society we live in

1124
01:06:50,280 --> 01:06:52,280
There are 5 do's a girl can do

1125
01:06:52,360 --> 01:06:54,360
And 50 don'ts she should not do

1126
01:06:54,440 --> 01:06:56,680
We can do the 5 which everyone likes

1127
01:06:56,760 --> 01:06:59,200
But can't do the 50 we dream about!

1128
01:07:00,080 --> 01:07:03,240
That's how simple a life of a woman is

1129
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:05,640
Since we are the
answers for everything...

1130
01:07:05,640 --> 01:07:07,440
...they thrive being the questions

1131
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:09,560
If we become the question...

1132
01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:11,200
...nobody will have an answer!

1133
01:07:12,520 --> 01:07:15,280
It's okay if you are
the Vasanthi no one knows

1134
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:18,720
But how did you turn into a Vasanthi
who's being mocked by everyone?

1135
01:07:18,760 --> 01:07:19,960
Instead of just living...

1136
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:23,000
...isn't it more important
to live with self-respect?

1137
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:26,280
Don't spend your lifetime being...

1138
01:07:26,320 --> 01:07:30,000
...this Vasanthi who daily
signs the attendance register

1139
01:07:31,040 --> 01:07:34,040
It's natural for women
to live for others

1140
01:07:34,120 --> 01:07:36,240
But also set aside
some time just for you

1141
01:07:36,320 --> 01:07:38,600
You need an identity of your own!

1142
01:07:42,760 --> 01:07:44,080
If you lose yourself...

1143
01:07:44,120 --> 01:07:46,320
...your dreams will also
be lost right before you

1144
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:48,960
You aren't like that

1145
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:51,360
Your dream is your signature!

1146
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:53,920
You can do it

1147
01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:55,160
You definitely can

1148
01:07:57,280 --> 01:08:02,120
In the way these girls dress
and their carefree smiles...

1149
01:08:02,200 --> 01:08:03,680
...a 'Vasanthi' is hidden

1150
01:08:05,480 --> 01:08:07,720
I need to see that Vasanthi

1151
01:08:08,440 --> 01:08:10,480
From now on I want to
see only that Vasanthi

1152
01:08:19,560 --> 01:08:20,880
Good morning, madam

1153
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:24,240
Madam, I read it

1154
01:08:24,280 --> 01:08:25,160
Super!

1155
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:26,320
You truly rock

1156
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:27,680
Fantastic, madam

1157
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:30,480
What's up?

1158
01:08:30,520 --> 01:08:32,440
Everybody is praising you sky high!

1159
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:33,600
With good reason

1160
01:08:33,680 --> 01:08:34,720
I'll tell you

1161
01:08:38,240 --> 01:08:40,200
Madam, my son showed it to me

1162
01:08:40,240 --> 01:08:41,360
I felt so proud

1163
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:43,240
What is it?

1164
01:08:43,480 --> 01:08:45,120
I'll show you in Facebook

1165
01:08:55,560 --> 01:08:57,880
Dear Facebook friends
A big and warm hello

1166
01:08:57,960 --> 01:09:00,320
I'm Vasanthi 36 years old

1167
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:02,040
This is my true identity

1168
01:09:02,120 --> 01:09:04,920
Dear boys and girls in Facebook
who hide their true identity...

1169
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:09,560
...using Suriya and Nayantara's
photos as their profile pics

1170
01:09:09,840 --> 01:09:13,200
I'm the one who fainted when
I met the Indian President

1171
01:09:13,240 --> 01:09:17,160
I disgraced all of you and our
nation to bow your heads in shame

1172
01:09:17,240 --> 01:09:19,960
Due to other priorities
in my personal life…

1173
01:09:20,040 --> 01:09:23,640
...and because daily like all of you
I couldn't afford to be in Facebook

1174
01:09:23,720 --> 01:09:26,720
…let me 1st apologize for
this delay in E-meeting you

1175
01:09:26,800 --> 01:09:30,520
Even though comments and cartoons
about me were remarkably funny...

1176
01:09:30,520 --> 01:09:32,120
...if I share with you the actual event

1177
01:09:32,160 --> 01:09:35,240
...it will help your creative
juices to flow even better!

1178
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:38,680
Please focus your attention 100%

1179
01:09:39,280 --> 01:09:40,600
I was waiting in the hall

1180
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,120
Surrounding me were 7 Black Cats

1181
01:09:43,360 --> 01:09:46,280
4 White Cats Only one was a female

1182
01:09:46,320 --> 01:09:49,480
Messages kept beeping
through wireless nonstop

1183
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:53,440
That the President was on his way

1184
01:09:55,960 --> 01:09:57,640
Not a whisper

1185
01:09:58,040 --> 01:09:58,960
Trust me!

1186
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:01,400
I was the only one breathing

1187
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:02,960
Tup!

1188
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:04,240
Door opens

1189
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:06,200
And in walks the President of India

1190
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:09,240
The most important second
in the history of the world

1191
01:10:09,320 --> 01:10:13,200
The President stood right in
front of me, clasped both his hands

1192
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:15,520
And said, 'Namaste'

1193
01:10:20,840 --> 01:10:22,960
Giving up all your spare
time as offering to Facebook

1194
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:24,240
Exhibiting without inhibitions

1195
01:10:24,280 --> 01:10:25,520
...your love and personal space

1196
01:10:25,560 --> 01:10:28,560
...to Tom, Dick and Jane
in the most willing manner

1197
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:31,440
Friends who render such social service

1198
01:10:32,240 --> 01:10:33,840
This dizzy spell isn't new to me

1199
01:10:34,280 --> 01:10:36,240
1st time I had this dizzy
spell when I met a man

1200
01:10:36,280 --> 01:10:37,440
I became his wife

1201
01:10:37,480 --> 01:10:39,560
The 2nd time I fainted I became a mother

1202
01:10:39,640 --> 01:10:43,240
By fainting in front of the President
I became a 'sister' to every one of you

1203
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:45,840
'Fainting' has always
placed me on a pedestal

1204
01:10:46,680 --> 01:10:47,840
There's a lot of time left

1205
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:50,120
My dear kith and kin Wait and see

1206
01:11:03,080 --> 01:11:05,760
Hats off, no one will
open their mouths again

1207
01:11:10,520 --> 01:11:12,160
There is 1 more mouth to zip!

1208
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:19,160
Good Lord!

1209
01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:25,920
Please come

1210
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,160
I'm just looking for the
kind of design you'll like

1211
01:11:28,240 --> 01:11:29,920
want to meet Tulasi'ma

1212
01:11:29,960 --> 01:11:31,480
She fell sick yesterday

1213
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:33,440
The boy in our shop
took her to the doctor

1214
01:11:33,480 --> 01:11:35,120
Do you want her address?

1215
01:11:36,040 --> 01:11:36,560
Yes

1216
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:37,640
Please wait for 5 minutes

1217
01:11:37,680 --> 01:11:38,640
I'll get it for you

1218
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:43,800
My inbox is overflowing

1219
01:11:43,880 --> 01:11:46,720
Do you know how many of
my friends praised you?

1220
01:11:47,680 --> 01:11:49,960
From where did you pick up this courage?

1221
01:11:51,160 --> 01:11:53,960
One day I just thought
I'm Mithila's mother

1222
01:11:54,200 --> 01:11:55,000
That's all

1223
01:11:56,640 --> 01:11:58,560
You should have seen dad's reaction, ma

1224
01:11:58,600 --> 01:12:00,040
He saw the video 2-3 times

1225
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:04,560
He inserted his ID card in the ATM

1226
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:07,240
He took the milk packet into the loo!

1227
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:10,040
His system is corrupt Needs to be reset

1228
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:11,880
- Where is dad?
- Not yet back from work

1229
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:13,760
Do you water our plants daily, ma?

1230
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:15,720
This will be cleared
within the next 2 days

1231
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:17,040
I've asked for help to dismantle

1232
01:12:17,080 --> 01:12:17,760
Why, mom?

1233
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,280
Flowering season is over

1234
01:12:19,480 --> 01:12:22,040
To plant fresh vegetables
I must start all over again

1235
01:12:22,120 --> 01:12:23,680
Who is here to help me do all this?

1236
01:12:23,720 --> 01:12:25,080
Food is my main problem here

1237
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:27,080
The food we eat once a year in India...

1238
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:29,200
...we eat 365 days here
and that's terrible, ma

1239
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:36,280
Just make some yummy food and
send it to me through whatsApp

1240
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:38,000
Very soon I'll be in Ireland

1241
01:12:38,040 --> 01:12:39,120
Don't worry

1242
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:41,800
Show me your cheek

1243
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:44,960
Love you, muah

1244
01:13:09,400 --> 01:13:10,640
I came to see you

1245
01:13:11,200 --> 01:13:12,480
Welcome me with open arms

1246
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:15,560
I heard you aren't well

1247
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:17,680
Old age is catching up on me

1248
01:13:18,080 --> 01:13:19,440
Really...you came only to see me?

1249
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:21,160
Of course This is for you

1250
01:13:21,560 --> 01:13:23,240
Why did you go to all this trouble?

1251
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:24,880
All grown on my terrace

1252
01:13:26,840 --> 01:13:27,800
Sit down

1253
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:28,720
I'll get you coffee

1254
01:13:28,760 --> 01:13:29,880
No, not now

1255
01:13:32,240 --> 01:13:33,760
I have 4 sons

1256
01:13:34,440 --> 01:13:37,280
None of them visit me
to find out how I am

1257
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:39,160
Believe it or not

1258
01:13:39,640 --> 01:13:41,880
Just this morning I was
thinking, if I had a daughter...

1259
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:43,840
...would she have
neglected me like this?

1260
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:45,720
And you are here now

1261
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:48,200
Then what...am I not your daughter?

1262
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:51,320
I'm of no use to anyone

1263
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:54,240
And just to see me you came all this way

1264
01:13:54,280 --> 01:13:56,000
Come inside

1265
01:14:01,160 --> 01:14:02,680
If you need to go to the hospital...

1266
01:14:02,720 --> 01:14:04,160
...let me know, I'll take you

1267
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:07,160
That isn't a problem

1268
01:14:07,200 --> 01:14:08,840
I'm quite mobile

1269
01:14:10,760 --> 01:14:15,120
What we need is the confidence
someone is there for us

1270
01:14:16,240 --> 01:14:17,560
There should be

1271
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:21,200
That's enough assurance
to live a 100 years

1272
01:14:28,520 --> 01:14:30,760
Who has that kind of time nowadays?

1273
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:33,160
In spite of your busy schedule...

1274
01:14:33,200 --> 01:14:35,480
...you took the trouble
of visiting me at home

1275
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:38,440
I won't forget this till my dying day

1276
01:14:58,720 --> 01:14:59,920
I'll take leave

1277
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:25,440
This is extremely clean

1278
01:15:25,480 --> 01:15:27,280
This is eggplant from the market

1279
01:15:27,320 --> 01:15:29,600
If you find an insect inside
then it is devoid of chemicals!

1280
01:15:29,640 --> 01:15:31,480
If the vegetable was
sprayed with insecticide…

1281
01:15:31,560 --> 01:15:33,080
…how will the insect thrive inside?

1282
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:41,360
Take a look

1283
01:15:41,680 --> 01:15:44,560
Nowadays like cheap dyes in textiles...

1284
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:46,640
...they also inject dyes into fruits

1285
01:15:46,680 --> 01:15:47,880
Look at this duplicate

1286
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:50,800
How mouth watering it is
with its ripe red color

1287
01:15:50,840 --> 01:15:52,800
Are people eating this crap?

1288
01:15:52,840 --> 01:15:54,000
Do they have a choice?

1289
01:15:54,440 --> 01:15:55,880
Even the winner of 'Masterchef'...

1290
01:15:55,920 --> 01:15:57,920
...can't get the right flavor using this

1291
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:02,040
This generation is oblivious
to a tasty gourmet meal

1292
01:16:02,080 --> 01:16:03,240
This is the bitter truth

1293
01:16:03,320 --> 01:16:06,080
If you give me vegetables
that are so fresh and organic…

1294
01:16:06,120 --> 01:16:08,480
…our wedding feast will
be the talk of the town

1295
01:16:08,520 --> 01:16:10,040
I take full responsibility for it

1296
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:23,520
Why did you bring me here?

1297
01:16:23,560 --> 01:16:24,920
Don't say a word

1298
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:26,440
Just nod your head

1299
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:27,600
I'll handle it

1300
01:16:27,640 --> 01:16:28,920
It is only for your benefit

1301
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:29,920
Come with me

1302
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:32,200
I have made a list of vegetables

1303
01:16:32,240 --> 01:16:33,120
Sir…?

1304
01:16:34,200 --> 01:16:36,080
Come in Good afternoon

1305
01:16:36,120 --> 01:16:37,680
Oh! I know you

1306
01:16:37,720 --> 01:16:39,640
She was the one who visited my shop

1307
01:16:40,120 --> 01:16:41,480
This is chef Selur Pichai

1308
01:16:41,560 --> 01:16:42,760
Good afternoon

1309
01:16:44,280 --> 01:16:45,600
Please take a seat

1310
01:16:48,680 --> 01:16:50,960
The vegetables you gave
Tulasi'ma were delicious

1311
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:52,360
She gave us some

1312
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:54,600
Without fertilizers clean and also tasty

1313
01:16:55,440 --> 01:16:57,040
I want you to supply the same quality

1314
01:16:57,080 --> 01:16:59,160
I'll buy it for whatever price you quote

1315
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:02,640
No rush, you can deliver in September

1316
01:17:02,680 --> 01:17:04,920
You have 5 months to grow fresh supplies

1317
01:17:05,840 --> 01:17:07,480
Then no problem, sir

1318
01:17:08,160 --> 01:17:09,720
Whoever cooks with your vegetables...

1319
01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:11,400
...will definitely dish out a tasty meal

1320
01:17:12,360 --> 01:17:15,480
This is a list for 2000 guests

1321
01:17:16,520 --> 01:17:17,160
How many?

1322
01:17:17,200 --> 01:17:18,040
2000

1323
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:21,760
If we need more?

1324
01:17:22,040 --> 01:17:26,160
My 2000 can easily accommodate 200 more

1325
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:30,160
This is for my daughter's
wedding reception

1326
01:17:33,080 --> 01:17:34,520
All credit goes to Tulasi'ma

1327
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:35,120
Is that so?

1328
01:17:35,200 --> 01:17:36,040
Let's go

1329
01:17:37,720 --> 01:17:41,320
Tulasi'ma told me about your 5 acre farm

1330
01:17:41,640 --> 01:17:44,280
Don't supply to anyone else

1331
01:17:44,320 --> 01:17:46,080
I'll buy the whole lot from you

1332
01:17:46,160 --> 01:17:47,920
But don't use pesticides

1333
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,600
I'm not prepared to poison my guests!

1334
01:17:50,680 --> 01:17:54,880
Tick whatever items you
can supply from this list

1335
01:17:54,920 --> 01:17:56,400
Rest I'll outsource

1336
01:17:56,480 --> 01:17:58,760
If you tell me within a
week, that's okay by me

1337
01:17:58,760 --> 01:17:59,440
Thank you

1338
01:17:59,480 --> 01:18:00,800
- I'll take leave
- Please do

1339
01:18:01,480 --> 01:18:02,960
I'll deal with you outside

1340
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:10,760
He has given a list like Hanuman's tail!

1341
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:12,640
With this header 'Lord Muruga's support'

1342
01:18:12,680 --> 01:18:13,920
Onion 40 Kg

1343
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:15,240
Tomato 35 Kg

1344
01:18:15,280 --> 01:18:16,480
Carrot 25 Kg

1345
01:18:16,520 --> 01:18:17,880
Potato 20 Kg

1346
01:18:18,240 --> 01:18:19,600
Green peas 5 Kg

1347
01:18:19,680 --> 01:18:21,600
This is a list for a whole market

1348
01:18:21,680 --> 01:18:22,680
Are you mad or what?

1349
01:18:22,720 --> 01:18:24,800
I thought he needed
vegetables for his house

1350
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:26,600
I had no clue it was
a wedding order, dear

1351
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:28,560
You said I own a farm of 5 acres

1352
01:18:29,320 --> 01:18:31,400
I thought it would add to your image

1353
01:18:31,480 --> 01:18:35,600
Tell him my huge farm split
into 2 in an earthquake

1354
01:18:37,400 --> 01:18:38,840
I'll lose my job, dear

1355
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:40,960
Give a convincing reason

1356
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:41,720
Why ask me?

1357
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:43,680
You must only pay for your mistakes

1358
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:48,680
You said you are like my own daughter

1359
01:18:50,520 --> 01:18:52,640
Okay, I have an idea

1360
01:18:53,560 --> 01:18:56,120
He asked me to tick what I can supply

1361
01:18:56,160 --> 01:18:58,240
And he'll outsource the rest, right?

1362
01:18:58,280 --> 01:18:59,880
I'll tick the header with God's support

1363
01:18:59,920 --> 01:19:01,320
Ask him to buy the rest outside

1364
01:19:01,400 --> 01:19:02,920
What's the matter, sis?

1365
01:19:02,960 --> 01:19:04,360
This is my problem

1366
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:06,440
What is this?

1367
01:19:08,120 --> 01:19:10,040
Onion, tomato...!

1368
01:19:10,080 --> 01:19:11,960
You call this an order?

1369
01:19:12,440 --> 01:19:14,000
Bro, don't forget my commission

1370
01:19:14,080 --> 01:19:15,480
Go and fetch the party

1371
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:22,880
Come inside, sis

1372
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:30,080
We must deliver separately to the hotel

1373
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:32,320
Bro, this is the lady who ordered

1374
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:33,920
Mani, help with the delivery

1375
01:19:33,960 --> 01:19:35,040
Okay, bro

1376
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:37,040
Madam, don't lose the list

1377
01:19:37,080 --> 01:19:38,520
Send it a week before the function

1378
01:19:38,600 --> 01:19:40,240
I'll bill you according
to that day's rate

1379
01:19:40,320 --> 01:19:41,520
If it's bought a week before...

1380
01:19:41,560 --> 01:19:42,920
...won't the vegetables rot?

1381
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:44,520
Will be fresh even for 10 days

1382
01:19:44,560 --> 01:19:45,760
1 day for plucking

1383
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:47,080
1 day for packing

1384
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:48,160
2 days in the lorry

1385
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:49,400
2 days with me

1386
01:19:49,440 --> 01:19:50,760
3 days in the retail outlet

1387
01:19:50,840 --> 01:19:52,160
4 days in your fridge

1388
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:54,120
It will altogether add up to 15 days

1389
01:19:54,200 --> 01:19:55,800
Growing vegetables in our back yard...

1390
01:19:55,840 --> 01:19:57,120
...is a thing of the past

1391
01:19:57,160 --> 01:19:58,360
We spray all this pesticide...

1392
01:19:58,400 --> 01:19:59,600
...to only increase shelf life

1393
01:19:59,640 --> 01:20:01,880
Onion over there is from Pakistan

1394
01:20:01,960 --> 01:20:03,240
If vegetables shouldn't ripe

1395
01:20:03,280 --> 01:20:04,680
...and if fruits should be ripe

1396
01:20:04,760 --> 01:20:06,520
...we have to resort to some gimmicks

1397
01:20:06,600 --> 01:20:09,360
But they want organic vegetables

1398
01:20:09,440 --> 01:20:10,960
No problem at all

1399
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:14,320
At that point of time,
dip them in mud like this

1400
01:20:14,360 --> 01:20:15,600
They'll be as good as new

1401
01:20:15,640 --> 01:20:17,360
For flies to squat on it...

1402
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:19,840
...all you got to do is spray this

1403
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:21,200
It will become organic

1404
01:20:21,280 --> 01:20:23,960
Don't you have real, organic vegetables?

1405
01:20:24,440 --> 01:20:26,920
Such vegetables don't
exist in our country

1406
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:28,880
Promptly in the seed
stage must mix chemicals

1407
01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:31,520
And spray fertilizers
4-5 times till they grow

1408
01:20:31,640 --> 01:20:34,360
What happens to the consumer
who eats all this poison?

1409
01:20:34,440 --> 01:20:36,680
Poison won't scare him away

1410
01:20:36,760 --> 01:20:38,520
Only price will make him run a mile!

1411
01:20:38,600 --> 01:20:40,760
It isn't as if tomatoes
are for the rich...

1412
01:20:40,840 --> 01:20:42,280
...and eggplants for the poor

1413
01:20:42,320 --> 01:20:44,680
It is one and the same for all

1414
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:46,520
You need any of the items here...

1415
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:48,880
...let me know, I'll have them delivered

1416
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:51,160
Spray carbide all over

1417
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:52,760
It has to ripen at the same time

1418
01:20:52,840 --> 01:20:54,320
Did you hear me?

1419
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:55,200
Okay, bro

1420
01:20:57,560 --> 01:20:58,840
Is Mithila there?

1421
01:20:59,480 --> 01:21:01,640
Ask her to call me when she gets back

1422
01:21:01,720 --> 01:21:03,440
Talk to Vasanthi, she is here

1423
01:21:03,520 --> 01:21:04,640
Go ahead, dear

1424
01:21:06,200 --> 01:21:07,160
I'm at work

1425
01:21:07,240 --> 01:21:08,720
I'll call after 5 minutes

1426
01:21:09,680 --> 01:21:10,400
Okay

1427
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:23,440
I'm expecting a call from my husband

1428
01:21:23,480 --> 01:21:24,800
I'll call you later

1429
01:22:08,840 --> 01:22:10,400
Sir, I'm Vasanthi speaking

1430
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:11,560
Tell me

1431
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:13,040
I'll take up your order

1432
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:17,960
I'll pay you an advance
whenever you want

1433
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:27,480
Where is this place, Vasanthi?

1434
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:28,360
Netherland

1435
01:22:28,400 --> 01:22:30,840
Many countries have succeeded
in this greenhouse concept

1436
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:32,840
Is this feasible in our city?

1437
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:34,680
Most farmers are having a tough time

1438
01:22:34,760 --> 01:22:37,000
And that too how will you succeed here?

1439
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:38,960
Terrace is ideal for boozing

1440
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:41,120
And playing cards will
be a roaring success

1441
01:22:41,160 --> 01:22:42,240
How's this possible?

1442
01:22:42,280 --> 01:22:43,920
What is the budget for this greenhouse?

1443
01:22:43,960 --> 01:22:45,480
Up to Rs 20,000

1444
01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:47,600
If we grow vegetables in 10 terraces...

1445
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:50,000
...we'll get enough produce
for 2000 people to eat

1446
01:22:50,040 --> 01:22:52,600
Enough to supply a wedding at one go

1447
01:22:52,680 --> 01:22:53,880
This is the estimate

1448
01:22:54,160 --> 01:22:58,760
Plus we will be eating organic food

1449
01:22:59,640 --> 01:23:01,160
Mutton is even more healthy

1450
01:23:01,200 --> 01:23:02,600
Goat is organic!

1451
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:05,000
Only if you read the newspaper daily...

1452
01:23:05,040 --> 01:23:07,600
...will you realize the
truth behind that lady's words

1453
01:23:07,680 --> 01:23:09,360
Baseless arguments and pointless digs...

1454
01:23:09,400 --> 01:23:11,600
...are reasons why India is vegetating!

1455
01:23:11,880 --> 01:23:13,120
Shall we do this?

1456
01:23:13,200 --> 01:23:15,200
Definitely we will, Vasanthi

1457
01:23:15,360 --> 01:23:20,040
I need some time to mobilize funds

1458
01:23:20,240 --> 01:23:21,920
Even if we have to pledge our jewelry...

1459
01:23:21,960 --> 01:23:23,280
...it's okay, we'll do it

1460
01:23:23,360 --> 01:23:25,440
See you, Vasanthi

1461
01:23:33,560 --> 01:23:35,360
You want to grow vegetables on a terrace

1462
01:23:35,400 --> 01:23:37,400
And supply for a wedding

1463
01:23:37,520 --> 01:23:39,160
Do you have any brains?

1464
01:23:39,680 --> 01:23:41,160
You'll never change

1465
01:23:41,200 --> 01:23:42,120
It's my bloody fate

1466
01:23:42,200 --> 01:23:43,800
No, all of us intend to join-

1467
01:23:43,880 --> 01:23:45,480
Don't do anything

1468
01:23:45,480 --> 01:23:47,000
We've got very little respect left

1469
01:23:47,080 --> 01:23:48,360
Please don't tarnish even that

1470
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:50,040
From fainting to wedding...

1471
01:23:50,080 --> 01:23:51,800
...will you keep humiliating me?

1472
01:23:51,880 --> 01:23:54,080
Whatever you do won't take off

1473
01:23:54,480 --> 01:23:56,800
You have a Govt job till you retire

1474
01:23:56,840 --> 01:23:58,120
Attend to it, enough

1475
01:24:07,280 --> 01:24:08,600
What did my son say?

1476
01:24:10,160 --> 01:24:11,160
Don't trouble yourself

1477
01:24:11,200 --> 01:24:12,120
Go to work

1478
01:24:12,200 --> 01:24:13,720
Take adequate rest

1479
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:18,400
I want to take a loan in my name

1480
01:24:19,880 --> 01:24:20,880
Sugar level is okay

1481
01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:22,400
Liver function okay

1482
01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:24,200
Your cholesterol is high

1483
01:24:25,480 --> 01:24:26,280
You must run

1484
01:24:26,360 --> 01:24:27,400
Out of this city?

1485
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:30,720
What happened to your terrace antics?

1486
01:24:30,920 --> 01:24:34,280
As usual, problem for men
is their male chauvinism!

1487
01:24:34,840 --> 01:24:36,240
All the ladies are fine with my idea

1488
01:24:36,280 --> 01:24:37,840
But they don't have the money

1489
01:24:38,480 --> 01:24:39,720
If I can take a loan-

1490
01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:41,280
If we can walk 4 kms a day?

1491
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:43,000
If cholesterol is reduced?

1492
01:24:43,080 --> 01:24:45,480
In 2 weeks, I'll sign
guarantee for your loan

1493
01:24:46,280 --> 01:24:47,400
Sounds good to hear

1494
01:24:47,440 --> 01:24:48,840
If it's a loan on your insurance...

1495
01:24:48,920 --> 01:24:49,960
...only if you're above 40

1496
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:51,760
...you need to show a
medical fitness report

1497
01:24:51,800 --> 01:24:52,800
Then what's the hitch?

1498
01:24:52,880 --> 01:24:55,240
Whole world knows of
your fainting spell!

1499
01:24:55,280 --> 01:24:57,680
So you are implying the
media will support me

1500
01:24:58,280 --> 01:25:01,240
I don't regret being an only child

1501
01:25:02,040 --> 01:25:03,400
I'm born with pain

1502
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:06,000
Suffering is not new to me

1503
01:25:07,400 --> 01:25:09,560
Childbirth is the pinnacle of pain

1504
01:25:10,120 --> 01:25:12,040
If there is any pain worse than that...

1505
01:25:13,520 --> 01:25:15,960
...it is when her husband humiliates her

1506
01:25:17,960 --> 01:25:19,640
I have gone through that too

1507
01:25:20,840 --> 01:25:22,520
Suffering is not new to me

1508
01:25:23,160 --> 01:25:24,080
I will walk

1509
01:25:24,760 --> 01:25:26,280
Even if I can't...

1510
01:25:28,040 --> 01:25:29,360
...I'll surely run

1511
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:34,720
Vasanthi...?

1512
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:40,440
I've been a teacher for 40 years

1513
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:41,800
But about organic food...

1514
01:25:41,880 --> 01:25:43,640
...or a hygienic life style

1515
01:25:43,680 --> 01:25:46,800
...not even once have
I taught any student

1516
01:25:47,960 --> 01:25:50,720
Thinking that reviewing is knowledge...

1517
01:25:50,840 --> 01:25:52,880
...my entire generation
has crumbled to fall

1518
01:25:53,560 --> 01:25:56,600
But as a form of atonement
I intend going door to door

1519
01:25:56,720 --> 01:25:59,400
I'll explain your concept
to everyone in this area

1520
01:25:59,480 --> 01:26:01,120
Don't worry your pretty little head

1521
01:26:01,200 --> 01:26:02,240
Go ahead boldly

1522
01:26:02,320 --> 01:26:03,960
We are all here for you

1523
01:26:23,560 --> 01:26:31,120
"With wings flapping fit
freedom on my wish list"

1524
01:26:31,200 --> 01:26:34,800
"I fly into horizons expanding"

1525
01:26:34,840 --> 01:26:38,600
"Into yonder blue skies ascending"

1526
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:45,160
"To sounds of the universe
new music to traverse"

1527
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:54,200
"I walk on shores extending
to meet my goal pending"

1528
01:26:54,280 --> 01:26:58,320
"A wish list of my very own"

1529
01:26:58,360 --> 01:27:01,960
"A dream where men don't wear the crown"

1530
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:05,840
"A journey seeking new responsibility"

1531
01:27:05,880 --> 01:27:09,520
"My sandals will be my
new wings of identity"

1532
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:13,200
"I walk baby steps enlightening"

1533
01:27:13,280 --> 01:27:16,920
"I revel in a fresh re-awakening"

1534
01:27:17,440 --> 01:27:23,760
"With grit I venture
into this green adventure"

1535
01:27:24,960 --> 01:27:31,640
"With great gusto my dream I follow"

1536
01:27:32,760 --> 01:27:38,280
“I run with faith and hope
Hurdles I intend to cope”

1537
01:27:55,880 --> 01:27:59,720
"In a square world I thought we lived"

1538
01:27:59,760 --> 01:28:03,640
"4 walls they were I realized later"

1539
01:28:03,680 --> 01:28:10,120
"I am setting foot on a journey
to the rim of the earth bravely"

1540
01:28:11,320 --> 01:28:18,960
"I detached myself from ‘me’
I drifted about aimlessly"

1541
01:28:19,120 --> 01:28:25,880
"I seize the day ‘carpe diem’ My
‘live life to the fullest’ anthem"

1542
01:28:26,440 --> 01:28:33,440
"Darkness in my mind eclipsing
light as a trailblazer I'm clasping"

1543
01:28:33,680 --> 01:28:40,120
"To the sun’s rays of radiance I
want to add my little luminance"

1544
01:28:41,680 --> 01:28:49,240
"I gain ground with steps bold
to empower women in our world"

1545
01:28:49,680 --> 01:28:55,680
"Entering exciting territory
to gather many a trophy”

1546
01:28:57,040 --> 01:29:04,360
"With wings flapping fit
Liberty on my wish list"

1547
01:29:04,960 --> 01:29:12,360
"With sunshine and success mine
I sprint to the finishing line"

1548
01:29:12,520 --> 01:29:20,160
"In our world with sounds varied
echoing with applause rallied"

1549
01:29:20,200 --> 01:29:24,160
"I race towards victory"

1550
01:29:24,240 --> 01:29:28,440
"To etch my foot prints in history"

1551
01:30:00,520 --> 01:30:02,960
Top Indian architects, ministers...

1552
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:04,720
...many celebrities are gathered here

1553
01:30:43,640 --> 01:30:44,760
A request

1554
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:46,520
Don't forget to wash your hands

1555
01:30:46,560 --> 01:30:48,640
These vegetables are from our market

1556
01:30:49,520 --> 01:30:53,520
Endosulfan, Ecolex, chlordane, fungicide

1557
01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:56,920
Some other chemicals might have
also rubbed off on to your hands

1558
01:30:56,960 --> 01:30:58,800
Liver, kidney dysfunction...

1559
01:30:58,840 --> 01:31:00,840
...depression and cancer

1560
01:31:04,160 --> 01:31:06,480
'Food is medicine, medicine is food'

1561
01:31:06,560 --> 01:31:08,440
...is what our forefathers have said

1562
01:31:08,520 --> 01:31:11,400
They have set a timetable
in diet and lifestyle...

1563
01:31:11,480 --> 01:31:14,120
...which is our treasured legacy

1564
01:31:14,200 --> 01:31:16,080
Without being selfish...

1565
01:31:16,120 --> 01:31:17,920
...they planted palm
trees in their backyards

1566
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,440
They thought of the needs
of the future generation

1567
01:31:20,520 --> 01:31:22,960
All this has become folklore now

1568
01:31:25,960 --> 01:31:27,720
Carrot with Vitamin
A is good for the eyes

1569
01:31:27,760 --> 01:31:29,440
Tomato with Vitamin C gives immunity

1570
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:31,160
String beans is a source of B complex

1571
01:31:31,200 --> 01:31:32,600
Eggplant provides calcium

1572
01:31:32,640 --> 01:31:35,840
Besides this, Endosulphan and Furidon

1573
01:31:35,920 --> 01:31:39,000
...and many other toxic stuff
abound in these vegetables

1574
01:31:39,440 --> 01:31:41,720
The skin of the apple
used to be nutritious

1575
01:31:41,760 --> 01:31:43,240
Now it only contains wax

1576
01:31:43,280 --> 01:31:45,800
Even if poisoned
vegetables are expensive...

1577
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:49,240
...poison is sold cheapest in India

1578
01:31:50,360 --> 01:31:53,240
Our grandmothers had a dozen children

1579
01:31:53,600 --> 01:31:55,680
The kids were raised
not only by the mother

1580
01:31:55,720 --> 01:31:57,200
Anyway that's quite impossible

1581
01:31:57,240 --> 01:31:58,760
Nature lent a hand too

1582
01:31:58,800 --> 01:32:00,360
Now with 1 or 2 kids...

1583
01:32:00,400 --> 01:32:02,760
...we rush to pediatricians so often

1584
01:32:02,800 --> 01:32:05,840
The previous generation
suffered only from old age

1585
01:32:05,880 --> 01:32:08,800
Now even the unborn
baby has a heart problem

1586
01:32:09,080 --> 01:32:11,040
At a tender age of 5 kids wear glasses

1587
01:32:11,080 --> 01:32:13,520
10 year olds are diagnosed
with diabetes, asthma or cancer

1588
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:14,960
Many more diseases

1589
01:32:14,960 --> 01:32:16,880
Rather than being healthy...

1590
01:32:16,920 --> 01:32:18,520
...we give importance to beauty

1591
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:20,320
Children should study
in a reputable school

1592
01:32:20,360 --> 01:32:21,600
A cushy job in a corporate firm

1593
01:32:21,640 --> 01:32:22,680
We think of buying a house

1594
01:32:22,720 --> 01:32:23,600
Or saving our funds

1595
01:32:23,640 --> 01:32:26,800
Why don't we think of being healthy?

1596
01:32:27,280 --> 01:32:28,280
We destroy fields

1597
01:32:28,320 --> 01:32:29,840
And build concrete jungles

1598
01:32:29,880 --> 01:32:33,840
Time should not reaffirm
'men are living graveyards'

1599
01:32:34,360 --> 01:32:35,560
This is the right moment

1600
01:32:35,600 --> 01:32:37,240
We should spring into action

1601
01:32:37,320 --> 01:32:39,480
We should trust our motherland

1602
01:32:39,880 --> 01:32:41,440
In future, when we build houses...

1603
01:32:41,520 --> 01:32:46,000
...reserve at least 1 cent space
to grow trees and a vegetable garden

1604
01:32:46,640 --> 01:32:49,280
On terraces as greenhouse

1605
01:32:49,720 --> 01:32:51,840
Just like water
harvesting was feasible...

1606
01:32:51,920 --> 01:32:55,560
...greenhouse is possible
on each and every terrace

1607
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:59,440
Friends, my fainting spell
was the talk of the town

1608
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:00,760
In another week's time...

1609
01:33:00,840 --> 01:33:06,880
...we'll be supplying organic vegetables
for a wedding with a 2000 guest list

1610
01:33:06,960 --> 01:33:10,080
...grown on neighboring
terraces only by ladies

1611
01:33:10,640 --> 01:33:12,560
We should carry out 2 good deeds at once

1612
01:33:12,640 --> 01:33:14,840
Each individual in
his or her lifetime...

1613
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:17,280
...should plant a seed
for at least 1 tree

1614
01:33:17,840 --> 01:33:20,600
For our children to
lead a healthy life...

1615
01:33:20,680 --> 01:33:24,440
...in every garden or terrace
we should grow vegetables

1616
01:33:24,800 --> 01:33:27,800
We should go back to respecting
the soil as our mother

1617
01:33:27,880 --> 01:33:30,800
And merge with nature
like our forefathers did

1618
01:33:31,240 --> 01:33:35,040
I thank all of you from
the bottom of my heart

1619
01:33:45,160 --> 01:33:48,600
I came here today like
just another meeting

1620
01:33:49,240 --> 01:33:52,880
In fact to prevent food
from being adulterated...

1621
01:33:52,920 --> 01:33:54,960
...Govt is taking many steps

1622
01:33:56,720 --> 01:34:01,760
But beyond that, your 'need of the hour'
talk should reach the public for sure

1623
01:34:02,960 --> 01:34:06,720
I'll inform all the members
of the Legislative assembly

1624
01:34:08,200 --> 01:34:10,600
This should change into a movement

1625
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:16,000
Volunteers like you should take the lead

1626
01:34:16,080 --> 01:34:17,080
Definitely

1627
01:34:18,440 --> 01:34:19,280
I'm glad

1628
01:34:19,360 --> 01:34:20,840
I'll take leave

1629
01:34:42,920 --> 01:34:44,720
Meeting was a huge success

1630
01:34:44,760 --> 01:34:45,880
Minister himself-

1631
01:34:46,720 --> 01:34:47,840
Go inside, my dear

1632
01:34:59,840 --> 01:35:02,400
You've changed a lot?!

1633
01:35:03,920 --> 01:35:06,760
Past 2 days, you didn't even
show your face on Skype to us!

1634
01:35:10,920 --> 01:35:12,080
Where is Mithila?

1635
01:35:12,160 --> 01:35:13,440
She has her exams now

1636
01:35:13,480 --> 01:35:14,840
Our neighbors are Tamilians

1637
01:35:14,880 --> 01:35:16,840
Their daughter and
Mithila are classmates

1638
01:35:16,880 --> 01:35:17,960
Nothing to worry

1639
01:35:24,880 --> 01:35:26,320
Are you happy now?

1640
01:35:26,800 --> 01:35:28,240
We leave on the 2nd

1641
01:35:28,280 --> 01:35:30,000
You've got just enough time to pack

1642
01:35:32,360 --> 01:35:34,480
How can I suddenly…office?

1643
01:35:34,560 --> 01:35:35,920
Take 1 year off

1644
01:35:35,960 --> 01:35:37,400
We'll think about it later

1645
01:35:41,160 --> 01:35:42,400
Not just that

1646
01:35:42,960 --> 01:35:44,960
I have some commitments here

1647
01:35:45,640 --> 01:35:47,040
Did you see our terrace?

1648
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:48,240
Yes, I did

1649
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:50,760
I saw the neighbors' terraces also

1650
01:35:51,680 --> 01:35:53,040
I've also spoken to dad

1651
01:35:53,080 --> 01:35:54,240
He'll take care of it

1652
01:35:54,800 --> 01:35:56,360
Loan isn't a big deal

1653
01:35:57,560 --> 01:36:00,160
Food and climate are
major problems in Ireland

1654
01:36:00,680 --> 01:36:02,640
Mithila is having a tough time

1655
01:36:02,720 --> 01:36:04,680
I don't know how to take care of her

1656
01:36:05,720 --> 01:36:07,600
I feel bad about all this

1657
01:36:08,040 --> 01:36:09,800
Thought of employing a housekeeper

1658
01:36:09,840 --> 01:36:12,000
But that would cost easily 50 to 60,000

1659
01:36:12,680 --> 01:36:14,360
And that too part time

1660
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:18,680
What?

1661
01:36:20,720 --> 01:36:22,280
For being so frank

1662
01:36:23,240 --> 01:36:25,520
If you had found a good housekeeper…

1663
01:36:25,640 --> 01:36:27,800
…would you have applied for my visa?

1664
01:36:27,880 --> 01:36:31,200
Oh! Madam has learnt to retort!

1665
01:36:31,280 --> 01:36:33,480
If wives keep cooking thrice a day…

1666
01:36:33,560 --> 01:36:35,200
…husbands will get bored

1667
01:36:35,280 --> 01:36:38,880
So wives now are forced
to think differently!

1668
01:36:39,480 --> 01:36:41,360
Before taking this decision…

1669
01:36:41,400 --> 01:36:43,440
…you could have discussed it with me

1670
01:36:43,720 --> 01:36:46,640
Okay, what are you saying now?

1671
01:36:46,680 --> 01:36:48,560
I've joined hands with many people…

1672
01:36:48,640 --> 01:36:51,360
…boosting everyone's confidence
I've taken up a big project

1673
01:36:51,440 --> 01:36:54,600
If I leave half way it
won't be right for sure

1674
01:36:54,920 --> 01:36:56,400
I need some time

1675
01:37:02,800 --> 01:37:05,280
Mithila, your mom isn't keen on coming

1676
01:37:06,440 --> 01:37:07,320
I don't know

1677
01:37:07,360 --> 01:37:08,360
Ask her yourself

1678
01:37:10,040 --> 01:37:11,560
You've got lot of commitments here

1679
01:37:11,600 --> 01:37:13,160
You find it tough to come over now

1680
01:37:13,160 --> 01:37:14,160
Tell her yourself

1681
01:37:23,720 --> 01:37:24,640
Mithila…?

1682
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:26,200
First stop crying

1683
01:37:27,920 --> 01:37:30,240
Okay, I'll be with you

1684
01:37:32,160 --> 01:37:33,320
I know, I'll come

1685
01:37:35,960 --> 01:37:36,840
I'll come

1686
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,560
Is this your 5 acre farm?

1687
01:38:12,720 --> 01:38:15,240
Your speech has been
published in The Hindu

1688
01:38:15,800 --> 01:38:18,440
Through the Food Safety department…

1689
01:38:18,480 --> 01:38:21,200
…our Govt is raiding
the district markets

1690
01:38:21,760 --> 01:38:24,160
This self help group with
only women really rocks!

1691
01:38:24,200 --> 01:38:25,280
Congratulations

1692
01:38:29,280 --> 01:38:31,000
Only 6 more days for the wedding

1693
01:38:31,080 --> 01:38:32,760
This is like a wedding
in your own family

1694
01:38:32,800 --> 01:38:34,520
Distribute these invitations please

1695
01:38:34,520 --> 01:38:35,880
All of you should definitely attend

1696
01:38:35,960 --> 01:38:36,680
We will, sir

1697
01:38:36,720 --> 01:38:38,440
Everyone will come for sure

1698
01:38:38,480 --> 01:38:40,800
But I doubt if I can make it!

1699
01:38:41,080 --> 01:38:44,360
I'm going to Ireland
with my husband on 2nd

1700
01:38:44,560 --> 01:38:48,000
But vegetables will be delivered
to the wedding hall on the 5th

1701
01:38:48,160 --> 01:38:50,360
I'll arrange everything before I go

1702
01:38:50,560 --> 01:38:51,640
Oh…! Is that so?

1703
01:38:52,680 --> 01:38:55,040
I'd have been glad if you had attended

1704
01:38:55,160 --> 01:38:55,880
It's okay

1705
01:38:55,920 --> 01:38:56,880
Have a safe trip

1706
01:38:56,960 --> 01:38:58,160
I'll take leave

1707
01:39:01,440 --> 01:39:03,040
Why all of a sudden, Vasanthi?

1708
01:39:04,080 --> 01:39:06,520
I must go for Mithila's sake!

1709
01:39:06,600 --> 01:39:08,440
I've applied for a year's leave

1710
01:39:08,560 --> 01:39:10,520
Only after I go there I
can decide anything else

1711
01:39:10,600 --> 01:39:12,000
Girija will really miss you

1712
01:39:12,040 --> 01:39:13,880
You're both like twins

1713
01:39:14,040 --> 01:39:15,880
I bought you a gift

1714
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:17,720
But I forgot to bring it!

1715
01:39:19,760 --> 01:39:21,440
I have a gift for madam

1716
01:39:21,560 --> 01:39:22,840
Book…right?

1717
01:39:22,920 --> 01:39:24,160
Must be a Tamil book

1718
01:39:24,200 --> 01:39:25,680
But you won't understand a word

1719
01:39:25,760 --> 01:39:27,040
Am I right?

1720
01:39:27,680 --> 01:39:28,720
No, you're wrong

1721
01:39:29,040 --> 01:39:29,960
Don't be alarmed

1722
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,400
The question Mithila asked the President

1723
01:39:33,600 --> 01:39:35,800
Mithila's friend Vani is my neighbor

1724
01:39:35,880 --> 01:39:37,120
She told me

1725
01:39:40,600 --> 01:39:43,400
Vasanthi…Vasanthi

1726
01:39:44,720 --> 01:39:47,000
What are you doing here
without packing your bags?

1727
01:39:51,120 --> 01:39:52,040
Don't worry

1728
01:39:52,120 --> 01:39:54,520
All the vegetables
in Ireland are organic

1729
01:39:54,640 --> 01:39:57,080
You know what Mithila
asked the President?

1730
01:39:57,480 --> 01:39:58,800
She did tell me

1731
01:39:59,720 --> 01:40:02,120
One day when we fought…

1732
01:40:02,840 --> 01:40:08,040
…you said a girl's dream
will expire after marriage!

1733
01:40:09,800 --> 01:40:11,280
It seems her question was...

1734
01:40:11,320 --> 01:40:13,760
...triggered by our fight

1735
01:40:14,800 --> 01:40:16,520
Hats off to that question!

1736
01:40:18,440 --> 01:40:21,640
Indira Gandhi was the only lady among
the 14 Prime ministers to hold office

1737
01:40:21,680 --> 01:40:25,080
Among our 15 Presidents
Pratiba Patil was the only lady

1738
01:40:25,120 --> 01:40:25,880
Why?

1739
01:40:26,120 --> 01:40:29,480
In this nation are there no
intelligent, capable women?

1740
01:40:29,840 --> 01:40:32,960
Or has someone hacked their dreams?

1741
01:40:35,320 --> 01:40:37,880
Who decides the expiry
date of a woman's dream?

1742
01:40:39,240 --> 01:40:41,480
Today in many states
women are the leaders

1743
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:44,360
Many of them who fight
for a cause are women

1744
01:40:45,080 --> 01:40:47,520
None of them have lost their dreams

1745
01:40:47,720 --> 01:40:49,520
Nor melted in their own tears!

1746
01:40:51,520 --> 01:40:52,920
I'm not coming to Ireland

1747
01:40:54,440 --> 01:40:56,640
My daughter asked me such a question

1748
01:40:56,840 --> 01:40:58,400
I'll make her understand!

1749
01:40:59,120 --> 01:41:00,280
Call her now

1750
01:41:04,520 --> 01:41:06,920
1st time I'm acting against your wishes

1751
01:41:07,360 --> 01:41:08,520
I'm your wife

1752
01:41:09,320 --> 01:41:12,320
Respect that bond and understand me

1753
01:41:57,600 --> 01:42:00,320
'Not only in Tamil Nadu
but all over India...'

1754

1760

'…I've cried nonstop reading
the sarcastic digs at my mom’

1761
01:42:28,360 --> 01:42:29,840

'…my answer will only be'

1768
01:42:46,560 --> 01:42:48,160
'...like Vasanthi!'

1769
01:42:48,320 --> 01:42:50,680
'Thank you Vasanthi
for being my mother!'

1770
01:42:50,960 --> 01:42:53,520
'It is a year since I've
been away from my mom'

1771
01:42:53,600 --> 01:42:55,840

1778
01:43:12,640 --> 01:43:15,080
'Today is an important
day in my mom's life'

1779
01:43:35,840 --> 01:43:36,840
'Namaste'

1780
01:43:43,600 --> 01:43:45,320
'Today my mom is here'

1781
01:43:45,400 --> 01:43:47,200
'Not for the question I asked'

1782
01:43:47,440 --> 01:43:49,120
'But as an answer for that question!'

1783
01:44:29,240 --> 01:44:32,160
2 years ago, I wanted
to meet an ordinary woman

1784
01:44:32,240 --> 01:44:34,720
…who asked me an extraordinary question

1785
01:44:35,400 --> 01:44:37,360
I was disappointed

1786
01:44:37,640 --> 01:44:40,600
Today, I'm meeting the
same woman to discuss...

1787
01:44:40,680 --> 01:44:43,920
…how to implement her
vision on a national level?

1788
01:44:46,120 --> 01:44:47,640
You fainted

1789
01:44:48,240 --> 01:44:49,440
But you woke up

1790
01:44:53,560 --> 01:44:56,600
Young man, you should be
very proud of your wife!

1791
01:45:24,880 --> 01:45:27,120
You introduced 'me' to myself
and made me understand...

1792
01:45:27,120 --> 01:45:29,040
...Delhi and Chennai
are only 3 hours apart

1793
01:45:29,120 --> 01:45:30,840
Susan, thanks, I owe this journey to you

1794
01:45:32,360 --> 01:45:33,960
I'm going to Ireland for a month

1795
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,880
Then my husband, Mithila and
I are planning a trip to Europe

1796
01:45:36,960 --> 01:45:38,280
Must see the world, right?

1797
01:45:41,600 --> 01:45:42,920
I'll also be in Europe at that time

1798
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:44,360
We should meet up too

1799
01:45:44,400 --> 01:45:45,200
Definitely

1800
01:45:45,280 --> 01:45:47,200
Before I forget, happy birthday

1801
01:45:48,720 --> 01:45:51,080
Today is a day I can never
forget in my whole life!

1802
01:45:51,600 --> 01:45:55,520
I have found my husband and
daughter with respect intact, Susan

1803
01:45:55,720 --> 01:45:57,040
This is Vasanthi

1804
01:45:57,640 --> 01:45:58,800
How old are you?

1805
01:45:59,440 --> 01:46:00,560
It doesn't matter

1806
01:47:00,680 --> 01:47:04,760
'Your dream is your signature!'

1807
01:47:12,160 --> 01:47:19,800
"In your mid 30s or 40s if you are
is your life a watch under repair?"

1808
01:47:19,880 --> 01:47:27,880
"Only if respected, should you be happy?
If self respect intact, you'll be royalty"

1809
01:47:46,640 --> 01:47:50,520
"Chitragupta, the record keeper,
Brahma's son is my neighbor"

1810
01:47:50,560 --> 01:47:54,360
"I looked up Brahma's register
your name wasn't listed there"

1811
01:47:54,400 --> 01:47:58,160
"Time is available Your
worries please bundle"

1812
01:47:58,200 --> 01:48:01,840
"Loads plenty and profuse
Put donkeys to good use"

1813
01:48:01,920 --> 01:48:09,640
"Happy...happy Always be happy"

1814
01:48:09,720 --> 01:48:15,160
"Happy...happy In all ways be happy"

1815
01:48:17,360 --> 01:48:21,280
"Every moment in time daily
a hen lays an egg diligently"

1816
01:48:21,320 --> 01:48:25,040
"A pan underneath is waiting
for the egg that's worrying"

1817
01:48:25,080 --> 01:48:28,840
"To live life (truth)fully
today has dawned specially"

1818
01:48:28,880 --> 01:48:33,560
"Try smiling daily Ear to ear happy"

1819
01:48:34,680 --> 01:48:40,480
"Happy...happy In all ways be happy"

1820
01:48:40,600 --> 01:48:45,880
"Happy...happy Always be happy"

1821
01:49:03,440 --> 01:49:10,920
"Life isn't a kitten furry
to run away in a flurry"

1822
01:49:11,160 --> 01:49:18,720
"Dogs neither are we
to chase it mindlessly"

1823
01:49:18,880 --> 01:49:22,720
"Life isn't a straight or bent road
to gauge how much farther to go"

1824
01:49:22,760 --> 01:49:26,520
"If you cross only half a well
dive in, you might as well"

1825
01:49:26,560 --> 01:49:33,840
"Happy...happy We might as well be"

1826
01:49:34,080 --> 01:49:40,640
"Happy...happy In all ways be happy"

1827
01:49:41,840 --> 01:49:49,560
"In your mid 30s or 40s if you are
is your life a watch under repair?"

1828
01:49:49,640 --> 01:49:57,120
"Only if respected, should you be happy?
If self respect intact, you'll be royalty"

1829
01:49:57,160 --> 01:50:04,720
"Happy...happy Always carefree"

1830
01:50:04,800 --> 01:50:12,240
"Happy...happy Forever
on a joyous spree"
