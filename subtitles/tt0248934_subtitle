1
00:02:59,761 --> 00:03:01,281
Appu Pillai..

2
00:02:59,761 --> 00:03:01,281
Appu Pillai..

3
00:03:02,961 --> 00:03:04,961
Oh, no. Is it morning already?
- Of course.

4
00:03:05,201 --> 00:03:06,601
I think he's already up.

5
00:03:07,561 --> 00:03:09,921
Give it here..
Oh, no.

6
00:03:27,881 --> 00:03:29,481
She was late to bring the milk.

7
00:03:29,881 --> 00:03:31,081
I scolded her.

8
00:03:36,081 --> 00:03:36,881
Tea, sir.

9
00:03:59,961 --> 00:04:02,401
Hello.
Is this the police station?

10
00:04:03,481 --> 00:04:04,681
I'm calling
from Mr. Harikrishnan's house.

11
00:04:17,161 --> 00:04:18,081
Answer the phone.

12
00:04:23,641 --> 00:04:25,641
Anil!
Anil?

13
00:04:29,721 --> 00:04:31,961
Hello?
Yes.

14
00:04:33,201 --> 00:04:36,081
Yes, this is the DySP's house.
I'll call him over.

15
00:04:36,881 --> 00:04:38,401
Brother, it's from the station.

16
00:04:38,481 --> 00:04:41,281
Ask them what the matter is.
- It's an emergency.

17
00:04:41,761 --> 00:04:42,761
Ask them for yourself.

18
00:04:51,401 --> 00:04:54,321
Hello, DySP here.
Yes.

19
00:04:55,121 --> 00:04:55,961
What?

20
00:04:58,361 --> 00:05:00,361
Who?
You mean the film director?

21
00:04:58,361 --> 00:05:00,361
Who?
You mean the film director?

22
00:05:01,961 --> 00:05:06,601
Yes..
Who informed the police?

23
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:09,201
Have you sent our men there?

24
00:05:10,481 --> 00:05:13,761
Has the corpse been tampered with?
Okay.

25
00:05:14,761 --> 00:05:17,601
That's sad.
I'll be there soon.

26
00:05:20,921 --> 00:05:23,961
Really unfortunate.
- Who has expired?

27
00:05:25,441 --> 00:05:27,681
Harikrishnan.
- Our Harikrishnan?

28
00:05:27,961 --> 00:05:30,081
The very same.
Harikrishnan, the film director.

29
00:05:30,761 --> 00:05:32,201
How?
- He was murdered.

30
00:05:32,441 --> 00:05:33,961
Who murdered him?
- Someone.

31
00:05:34,241 --> 00:05:35,881
This would turn out
to be a sensation.

32
00:05:36,321 --> 00:05:39,481
Where did it happen?
- At his house.

33
00:05:40,081 --> 00:05:41,961
At his workplace.

34
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:47,521
If anyone calls, let them know
that I'm heading to the station.

35
00:05:48,441 --> 00:05:50,801
Move aside..

36
00:05:59,121 --> 00:06:00,681
Move aside..

37
00:05:59,121 --> 00:06:00,681
Move aside..

38
00:06:01,961 --> 00:06:02,801
Give some space, kids.

39
00:06:03,281 --> 00:06:04,841
Move..

40
00:06:05,201 --> 00:06:07,801
Ask them to step aside..
- Move away!

41
00:06:09,081 --> 00:06:10,121
Move.

42
00:06:12,241 --> 00:06:13,361
He's the watchman.

43
00:07:50,601 --> 00:07:51,881
Instant attack.
- Sir.

44
00:08:08,561 --> 00:08:11,041
It belongs to a woman.
- Mark it. - Sir.

45
00:08:13,161 --> 00:08:14,441
When they bring the dog in here

46
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:17,601
instruct the rest not
to touch anything.

47
00:08:18,521 --> 00:08:20,081
You must supervise them.
- Sir.

48
00:08:33,081 --> 00:08:34,401
It's getting crowded outside.

49
00:08:34,961 --> 00:08:37,801
It'll be difficult if we
delay to move the body.

50
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:41,441
Few reporters are present here.

51
00:08:41,561 --> 00:08:44,321
They'll create a commotion.
- Nobody should be allowed inside.

52
00:08:45,281 --> 00:08:48,281
Only close relatives and policemen
should be allowed inside. - Sir.

53
00:09:32,001 --> 00:09:32,961
You can't enter.

54
00:09:33,201 --> 00:09:35,601
Certain formalities
are taking place right now.

55
00:09:35,721 --> 00:09:37,361
There's no entry.

56
00:09:38,121 --> 00:09:41,081
Sir, I'm his.. - Be it anyone,
you'll have to wait.

57
00:09:41,161 --> 00:09:42,681
Please tell them, too.

58
00:09:44,641 --> 00:09:45,561
His family is here.

59
00:09:45,961 --> 00:09:48,681
Okay.
Don't let them in for now.

60
00:09:49,161 --> 00:09:52,001
Let them in only after the finger
print and forensic work is done.

61
00:09:52,521 --> 00:09:54,081
They should be permitted
only after Simon's approval.

62
00:09:54,321 --> 00:09:55,521
Go now.
- Sir.

63
00:09:57,761 --> 00:10:00,041
Rajasekharan Nair,
bring the watchman.

64
00:09:57,761 --> 00:10:00,041
Rajasekharan Nair,
bring the watchman.

65
00:10:02,881 --> 00:10:04,881
Appunni, are you the first one
to have seen the body? - Yes.

66
00:10:04,961 --> 00:10:07,321
How?
- When I went to serve the tea.

67
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:09,481
What was the time then?
- Nearly 6:30 a.m.

68
00:10:10,161 --> 00:10:11,921
It was early in the morning.

69
00:10:12,241 --> 00:10:14,121
Does he normally wake up
at that time?

70
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:15,921
Sometimes he wakes up
even before that.

71
00:10:16,401 --> 00:10:18,201
He likes to wake up early
in the morning.

72
00:10:18,361 --> 00:10:20,921
Does he wake up early
to write the script? - Yes.

73
00:10:20,961 --> 00:10:21,761
'Smoking is injurious to health.'

74
00:10:22,081 --> 00:10:23,401
Is the house and its plot
under his ownership?

75
00:10:23,481 --> 00:10:24,601
Yes.

76
00:10:24,721 --> 00:10:27,081
The cottage was built by him

77
00:10:27,321 --> 00:10:29,681
so that he could write peacefully.

78
00:10:30,041 --> 00:10:31,241
He has another house in the city.

79
00:10:31,321 --> 00:10:32,321
Yes.

80
00:10:32,481 --> 00:10:36,721
But still, he stays here
whenever there is any work.

81
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:38,801
Won't he go to that house
at that time? - No.

82
00:10:39,281 --> 00:10:41,721
How many days does he stay
without going home?

83
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:43,881
Till the work ends.

84
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:47,721
Sometimes he had stayed
continuously up to two months.

85
00:10:48,161 --> 00:10:49,201
Won't he go to his house
at that time?

86
00:10:49,281 --> 00:10:51,361
No, he won't go anywhere.

87
00:10:51,601 --> 00:10:53,761
At that time,
he has nothing in his mind

88
00:10:53,841 --> 00:10:55,201
except the script.

89
00:10:55,681 --> 00:10:57,121
How about his wife?
- He used to call her

90
00:10:57,201 --> 00:10:58,561
through the phone.
Nothing more.

91
00:10:58,921 --> 00:11:00,521
Sometimes, she comes here.

92
00:10:58,921 --> 00:11:00,521
Sometimes, she comes here.

93
00:11:01,121 --> 00:11:03,761
Who else comes here?
- Not many..

94
00:11:04,481 --> 00:11:06,561
There must be someone.

95
00:11:06,841 --> 00:11:08,481
Producers, film stars..

96
00:11:09,721 --> 00:11:10,721
New comers?

97
00:11:12,801 --> 00:11:14,161
Quite a few people
come here to meet him.

98
00:11:14,241 --> 00:11:16,041
Male or female?
- Both.

99
00:11:16,201 --> 00:11:17,561
To get a chance in the film?
- Yes.

100
00:11:18,321 --> 00:11:21,321
He found this place
so that he can avoid

101
00:11:21,441 --> 00:11:24,361
such nuisance.

102
00:11:25,161 --> 00:11:27,481
Yet, some people come here.

103
00:11:30,681 --> 00:11:32,161
Appunni,
do you get drunk often?

104
00:11:34,081 --> 00:11:36,281
I can see it in your face.
- Yes, I do.

105
00:11:36,441 --> 00:11:39,321
How's it?
Daily or whenever you get?

106
00:11:39,801 --> 00:11:42,041
Not daily.. but..

107
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:44,041
So, you drink daily.

108
00:11:46,961 --> 00:11:48,561
Does your master give it to you?
- No.

109
00:11:48,721 --> 00:11:51,081
I have never gone in
front of him drunk.

110
00:11:51,401 --> 00:11:53,881
If I feel that I smell,
I don't come out.

111
00:11:54,161 --> 00:11:55,441
I stay in the kitchen itself.

112
00:11:55,521 --> 00:11:57,161
When did you meet him
the last time?

113
00:11:57,241 --> 00:11:58,361
Evening.

114
00:11:58,681 --> 00:12:00,441
I went outside in the evening.

115
00:11:58,681 --> 00:12:00,441
I went outside in the evening.

116
00:12:00,601 --> 00:12:03,521
What was the time?
- Almost 5 p.m.

117
00:12:04,161 --> 00:12:05,641
Did you ask his permission
before you left? - Yes.

118
00:12:09,481 --> 00:12:11,481
At what time did you return?
- At midnight.

119
00:12:11,921 --> 00:12:14,121
He told me to keep the food
on the table.

120
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:15,841
Whenever he says that,
it means

121
00:12:16,241 --> 00:12:17,801
I can return at any time.

122
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:21,441
Whenever he gives you permission,
you get drunk, don't you?

123
00:12:24,081 --> 00:12:27,281
So yesterday, when he told you
to keep the food on the table

124
00:12:27,361 --> 00:12:29,001
you got drunk heavily, didn't you?

125
00:12:29,641 --> 00:12:31,481
Yesterday, I drank a lot.

126
00:12:31,721 --> 00:12:33,361
Did you meet him after that?
- No.

127
00:12:33,881 --> 00:12:38,401
I made sounds like coughing
to make him notice that I came.

128
00:12:38,881 --> 00:12:40,401
Did you see someone else there?

129
00:12:40,561 --> 00:12:42,681
No.
The light in his room was on.

130
00:12:42,841 --> 00:12:45,281
I thought he was writing.
So, I didn't go to his room.

131
00:12:45,881 --> 00:12:47,561
Why?
- I told you..

132
00:12:47,881 --> 00:12:49,761
I won't go
in front of him if I'm drunk.

133
00:12:50,121 --> 00:12:52,921
Usually he would call me
if he requires anything.

134
00:12:54,201 --> 00:12:55,481
We got an evidence.

135
00:12:55,801 --> 00:12:56,841
A slipper.

136
00:12:57,401 --> 00:12:58,561
Slipper?

137
00:12:58,641 --> 00:12:59,841
Sir, a ladies slipper.

138
00:13:01,161 --> 00:13:02,361
Just one or a pair?

139
00:13:02,681 --> 00:13:04,841
A single one. - Our dog found it
by picking up the smell.

140
00:13:05,081 --> 00:13:06,441
Where was it?
- Near the corridor.

141
00:13:07,361 --> 00:13:09,001
Did he have any guests yesterday?
- No.

142
00:13:09,081 --> 00:13:11,881
Day before yesterday? - He was here
for the last nine days.

143
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:15,881
I'm sure
that no one entered the compound

144
00:13:16,001 --> 00:13:18,121
except me and the milk-woman.

145
00:13:18,361 --> 00:13:19,881
You must come to the station,
Appu Pillai.

146
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:21,161
I have some more questions.

147
00:13:21,321 --> 00:13:23,001
Please, sir.
He is the reason

148
00:13:23,161 --> 00:13:26,961
that I'm still alive.
Please don't distrust me.

149
00:13:27,361 --> 00:13:28,441
Get lost!

150
00:13:35,201 --> 00:13:38,321
It was covered with sand
but the dog pulled it out.

151
00:13:56,841 --> 00:13:58,841
Tell Simon to seal
the door and the gate

152
00:13:58,961 --> 00:14:01,561
after the body has been sent
for post-mortem.

153
00:13:58,961 --> 00:14:01,561
after the body has been sent
for post-mortem.

154
00:14:01,641 --> 00:14:03,361
Assign two constables as well.

155
00:14:03,481 --> 00:14:04,601
Keep the people away.

156
00:14:05,481 --> 00:14:06,961
Everybody move aside.

157
00:14:07,161 --> 00:14:08,561
Move!

158
00:14:09,321 --> 00:14:11,281
Move!

159
00:14:11,401 --> 00:14:13,041
Move aside!

160
00:14:29,281 --> 00:14:30,401
Congratulations.

161
00:14:30,921 --> 00:14:31,881
What for?

162
00:14:32,001 --> 00:14:33,241
Your good time has started.

163
00:14:33,401 --> 00:14:35,961
I saw you on TV.

164
00:14:36,801 --> 00:14:39,641
From tomorrow on your
life is about to change.

165
00:14:41,601 --> 00:14:45,721
Your photo will be published
in the film weekly.

166
00:14:46,081 --> 00:14:49,001
Your interrogation with the actors
and actress..

167
00:14:49,401 --> 00:14:51,361
I get goose bumps.

168
00:14:52,361 --> 00:14:53,961
I will question
only the male actors.

169
00:14:54,881 --> 00:14:58,041
The actresses will be left alone
with a kiss. Get lost!

170
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:01,601
The case is a big headache.

171
00:15:03,001 --> 00:15:04,441
I'm getting phone calls
from ministers, media

172
00:15:04,801 --> 00:15:06,961
and even college students.

173
00:15:07,761 --> 00:15:09,281
Around half an hour back
a young girl called me

174
00:15:09,561 --> 00:15:12,041
and she was literally crying
through the phone.

175
00:15:12,361 --> 00:15:13,881
She was saying
that the police is irresponsible.

176
00:15:14,961 --> 00:15:17,161
Even though people talk
different things about him

177
00:15:17,801 --> 00:15:21,041
he has a huge fan base.

178
00:15:21,601 --> 00:15:24,281
He was at the peak of his career.

179
00:15:25,761 --> 00:15:29,201
His death will only give him
more recognition.

180
00:15:29,961 --> 00:15:33,521
He proved that we should die
at our best time.

181
00:15:34,481 --> 00:15:35,761
Anyway, it is a cruel case.

182
00:15:36,361 --> 00:15:38,441
The only writer
that I wanted to meet

183
00:15:39,241 --> 00:15:41,921
from the film industry was him.

184
00:15:42,601 --> 00:15:43,841
He was a real artist.

185
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:47,241
I have bought a pint.

186
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:48,361
Let's celebrate.

187
00:15:48,441 --> 00:15:51,561
This is the first case you got
after the promotion. Superb!

188
00:15:51,721 --> 00:15:54,801
There is no thrill in investigating
ordinary murder cases.

189
00:15:55,241 --> 00:15:56,961
But now if you solve it,
you will become famous.

190
00:15:57,121 --> 00:15:58,521
I will be famous
even if I don't solve it.

191
00:15:59,161 --> 00:16:01,241
But it will be unpleasant.

192
00:15:59,161 --> 00:16:01,241
But it will be unpleasant.

193
00:16:03,121 --> 00:16:04,641
From where did the lady
board your auto rickshaw?

194
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:05,961
Near the bus stand.

195
00:16:06,241 --> 00:16:07,161
What was the time then?

196
00:16:07,321 --> 00:16:08,321
Almost 7:30 p.m.

197
00:16:09,121 --> 00:16:11,241
Was she looking suspicious then?
- No.

198
00:16:11,401 --> 00:16:12,481
Then,
when did you begin to doubt her?

199
00:16:12,641 --> 00:16:13,841
When I saw the news
in the newspaper.

200
00:16:14,361 --> 00:16:15,561
Was there any reason
for you to doubt her?

201
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:18,201
I read in the newspaper
that the suspect is a lady.

202
00:16:19,841 --> 00:16:21,561
Why did you doubt her?

203
00:16:21,641 --> 00:16:24,641
I dropped her
near Harikrishnan's cottage.

204
00:16:24,961 --> 00:16:27,241
There were no other houses
nearby.

205
00:16:28,361 --> 00:16:29,401
How far was the cottage

206
00:16:29,521 --> 00:16:31,121
from the place
where you dropped her?

207
00:16:31,161 --> 00:16:33,241
Very close.
Almost 1 furlong.

208
00:16:35,561 --> 00:16:37,801
Have you ever been
to the cottage before?

209
00:16:37,961 --> 00:16:39,401
Yes.
- When?

210
00:16:39,521 --> 00:16:41,161
Many times.
- With whom?

211
00:16:41,481 --> 00:16:42,601
I have taken many people there.

212
00:16:43,281 --> 00:16:45,321
Did you know him personally?
- Yes, I knew him.

213
00:16:46,561 --> 00:16:49,681
Can you tell me her age?

214
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:51,641
I don't know exactly.

215
00:16:51,801 --> 00:16:53,161
But she looked young.

216
00:16:54,361 --> 00:16:55,881
What was she wearing?
- Sari.

217
00:16:56,561 --> 00:16:57,801
What was the colour?

218
00:16:57,881 --> 00:16:59,761
I think it was grey in colour.

219
00:16:59,921 --> 00:17:01,841
Can you recognise her
if you see her again?

220
00:16:59,921 --> 00:17:01,841
Can you recognise her
if you see her again?

221
00:17:02,961 --> 00:17:04,041
It's difficult..

222
00:17:04,881 --> 00:17:06,521
I don't remember her face clearly.

223
00:17:07,281 --> 00:17:08,521
I haven't seen her here before.

224
00:17:16,161 --> 00:17:18,321
How long have you been married?

225
00:17:20,161 --> 00:17:21,241
Three years.

226
00:17:21,441 --> 00:17:22,761
They just celebrated
their anniversary.

227
00:17:23,401 --> 00:17:27,361
I have heard that your family
opposed your marriage with him.

228
00:17:29,481 --> 00:17:30,881
What was the reason?

229
00:17:32,321 --> 00:17:34,001
Was it because
he was a script writer?

230
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:36,241
Yes, mainly it was the reason.

231
00:17:36,521 --> 00:17:40,081
And also, Ragini got a proposal
from a renowned family.

232
00:17:40,401 --> 00:17:43,881
Who are you?
- I'm her aunt.

233
00:17:44,121 --> 00:17:45,841
What's your name?
- Leelamma.

234
00:17:45,921 --> 00:17:47,641
Do you stay here with her?
- Yes.

235
00:17:47,841 --> 00:17:49,041
How long has it been?

236
00:17:49,121 --> 00:17:50,601
Almost for the last six years.

237
00:17:51,761 --> 00:17:54,201
As Harikrishnan was busy
with his work

238
00:17:54,321 --> 00:17:57,961
I came here to help Ragini.

239
00:17:58,161 --> 00:17:59,921
For the last six years?
- Yes.

240
00:18:00,881 --> 00:18:03,321
I will talk to you later.

241
00:18:04,121 --> 00:18:07,121
No need to answer the questions
that are asked to Ragini.

242
00:18:07,201 --> 00:18:08,361
Do you understand?

243
00:18:09,521 --> 00:18:10,641
Please sit.

244
00:18:16,721 --> 00:18:20,601
At this stage,
it will be helpful for both of us

245
00:18:20,681 --> 00:18:23,801
if you answer the questions
truthfully.

246
00:18:24,441 --> 00:18:25,921
You know it, don't you?

247
00:18:27,721 --> 00:18:29,441
How was your married life?

248
00:18:30,961 --> 00:18:32,201
I mean..

249
00:18:34,161 --> 00:18:35,601
It was fine.

250
00:18:35,721 --> 00:18:38,961
That means, you didn't have
any family problems, did you?

251
00:18:39,121 --> 00:18:41,521
Every family has problems.

252
00:18:43,921 --> 00:18:46,401
There was no exception
here as well.

253
00:18:46,561 --> 00:18:48,241
But I heard
an entirely different story.

254
00:18:50,161 --> 00:18:53,961
I've heard that Harikrishnan
had relationships with many women

255
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:58,281
and that was the reason behind
all your problems.

256
00:18:59,241 --> 00:19:00,521
It's a lie.

257
00:18:59,241 --> 00:19:00,521
It's a lie.

258
00:19:01,161 --> 00:19:02,401
It's a made up story.

259
00:19:07,241 --> 00:19:09,281
Do you use handkerchief often?

260
00:19:09,921 --> 00:19:11,961
I mean, is it a habit?

261
00:19:13,321 --> 00:19:14,321
No, it's not.

262
00:19:14,441 --> 00:19:17,321
You might use a kerchief
whenever you go out, right?

263
00:19:18,721 --> 00:19:20,201
Not very often.

264
00:19:20,521 --> 00:19:21,841
Sometimes I use it.

265
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:23,641
Can I see your handkerchief?

266
00:19:24,841 --> 00:19:26,321
Just unfold it.

267
00:19:27,921 --> 00:19:30,321
Do you often use
these type of handkerchiefs?

268
00:19:30,721 --> 00:19:31,881
No.

269
00:19:31,961 --> 00:19:34,081
Is this yours?

270
00:19:37,961 --> 00:19:39,961
No.
- Haven't you seen it before?

271
00:19:40,601 --> 00:19:41,721
No.

272
00:19:41,801 --> 00:19:43,081
Have you seen
this type of kerchief

273
00:19:43,401 --> 00:19:46,441
with any of the ladies
that have come here?

274
00:19:47,401 --> 00:19:48,681
No.

275
00:19:48,881 --> 00:19:50,081
Can you put this slipper on?

276
00:19:51,161 --> 00:19:52,281
Please, put it on.

277
00:20:03,961 --> 00:20:04,841
Thank you.

278
00:20:05,961 --> 00:20:07,121
Now, you wear this.

279
00:20:08,161 --> 00:20:11,001
Sorry, I won't use slippers
that other people have used.

280
00:20:11,161 --> 00:20:12,281
I'm allergic.

281
00:20:12,361 --> 00:20:14,961
I'm not asking you to use it.
I want to check the measurement.

282
00:20:30,121 --> 00:20:32,081
We got this slipper
from the place of the incident.

283
00:20:32,161 --> 00:20:33,761
Why are you making us wear this?

284
00:20:34,281 --> 00:20:36,681
As the suspect is a lady..

285
00:20:36,841 --> 00:20:39,481
and as
you said that he didn't have

286
00:20:39,561 --> 00:20:41,121
relationships with other women

287
00:20:41,721 --> 00:20:43,961
whom else should
I ask to wear this?

288
00:20:47,481 --> 00:20:48,481
Please come with me.

289
00:20:57,081 --> 00:20:59,761
Have you ever seen Harikrishnan
beating his wife?

290
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:02,721
He was not that type of a man.

291
00:21:05,601 --> 00:21:06,881
Any commotion
due to the difference in opinion?

292
00:21:07,041 --> 00:21:08,241
I haven't heard anything.

293
00:21:08,881 --> 00:21:13,641
They had problems that any
ordinary family would have.

294
00:21:14,241 --> 00:21:16,841
Was not being blessed with a child
a problem between them?

295
00:21:17,601 --> 00:21:21,761
Normally, it's a.. - I don't think
that was ever a problem.

296
00:21:21,961 --> 00:21:25,241
Do you know
who was the impotent one?

297
00:21:25,401 --> 00:21:26,521
I never asked them about it.

298
00:21:26,601 --> 00:21:29,521
Still..
- I think, it's him.

299
00:21:29,641 --> 00:21:31,641
Ragini might not be having
any problems.

300
00:21:31,961 --> 00:21:35,121
No women in our family
has suffered this problem.

301
00:21:37,081 --> 00:21:38,681
Do you know his close friends?

302
00:21:39,121 --> 00:21:41,361
He didn't have many friends.

303
00:21:42,081 --> 00:21:43,721
We can say that
he didn't have any friends.

304
00:21:44,161 --> 00:21:46,881
He was always busy with his work.

305
00:21:47,321 --> 00:21:49,881
There might be someone.

306
00:21:50,241 --> 00:21:52,841
Everyone would have
a long-time friend

307
00:21:52,921 --> 00:21:55,241
that knows all our secrets.

308
00:21:56,321 --> 00:21:57,361
Who might that be?

309
00:21:57,681 --> 00:21:59,161
There was a guy named Menon.

310
00:21:59,721 --> 00:22:02,521
He was the only one
who was close to him.

311
00:21:59,721 --> 00:22:02,521
He was the only one
who was close to him.

312
00:22:02,641 --> 00:22:03,681
Is he from the film industry?

313
00:22:03,841 --> 00:22:06,601
No. He is an officer
in New India Chemicals.

314
00:22:07,641 --> 00:22:10,961
I know him since the time
we were in school.

315
00:22:11,401 --> 00:22:12,401
We were also studied
in the same college.

316
00:22:12,681 --> 00:22:14,921
He opted Literature
and I was in Chemistry.

317
00:22:15,321 --> 00:22:17,041
Where are his parents?

318
00:22:17,201 --> 00:22:20,361
Mom.. He considered
my mom as his own.

319
00:22:20,921 --> 00:22:22,881
He lost his mother
when he was a child.

320
00:22:23,401 --> 00:22:25,121
His father is still alive..
in his native place.

321
00:22:25,281 --> 00:22:27,841
He is old now. - Did he have
any brothers or sisters?

322
00:22:28,001 --> 00:22:29,041
No.

323
00:22:29,721 --> 00:22:33,041
You were friends with him when
he got married to Ragini, right?

324
00:22:33,121 --> 00:22:34,241
Yes.

325
00:22:34,641 --> 00:22:35,841
How did they marry?

326
00:22:35,921 --> 00:22:38,321
I was the one
who took the initiative

327
00:22:38,761 --> 00:22:40,521
to get them married.

328
00:22:41,041 --> 00:22:44,201
Ragini was a huge fan of Hari.

329
00:22:44,841 --> 00:22:46,961
Then the relation
went to a different level.

330
00:22:47,601 --> 00:22:49,721
Even though she knew
that he had other relationships

331
00:22:50,241 --> 00:22:51,481
she was still willing to marry him

332
00:22:52,081 --> 00:22:54,841
going against her family.

333
00:22:55,081 --> 00:22:56,161
I know that.

334
00:22:56,241 --> 00:22:57,921
After that,
how did the problems begin?

335
00:22:58,441 --> 00:22:59,841
It was supposed to!

336
00:23:00,081 --> 00:23:01,881
A girl will only know
what it means to be a wife

337
00:23:02,361 --> 00:23:03,921
after getting married.

338
00:23:05,641 --> 00:23:08,641
But what I heard was
that she used to swear at him

339
00:23:08,881 --> 00:23:10,841
when he got calls
from other women.

340
00:23:11,641 --> 00:23:12,681
It's true.

341
00:23:13,121 --> 00:23:15,081
Their relationship
started in a dispute

342
00:23:15,161 --> 00:23:16,481
and ended in a war.

343
00:23:17,721 --> 00:23:19,961
Ragini used to tell us
the complete details

344
00:23:20,041 --> 00:23:22,561
about all their fights.

345
00:23:23,601 --> 00:23:25,281
Sometimes we had to interfere.

346
00:23:25,921 --> 00:23:27,041
But we stopped after a while.

347
00:23:27,121 --> 00:23:29,081
I heard that your relationship
with them haven't been good

348
00:23:29,161 --> 00:23:31,121
since the last one
and a half years.

349
00:23:32,041 --> 00:23:33,161
Yes, it's true.

350
00:23:33,481 --> 00:23:34,561
What was the reason?

351
00:23:35,481 --> 00:23:36,721
The reason..

352
00:23:37,921 --> 00:23:40,161
Have you heard
about the actress Thulasi?

353
00:23:40,441 --> 00:23:41,441
Of course.

354
00:23:41,521 --> 00:23:43,361
She is the present rising star.

355
00:23:43,881 --> 00:23:47,641
There were some gossips
about her and an actor.

356
00:23:47,761 --> 00:23:48,801
Yes, that's her.

357
00:23:48,921 --> 00:23:53,081
Hari was the one who found her,
introduced her and made her a star.

358
00:23:53,521 --> 00:23:55,801
She came from a poor background.

359
00:23:56,401 --> 00:23:59,881
The media made many gossips
about her and Hari.

360
00:24:00,041 --> 00:24:01,441
That made Ragini furious.

361
00:24:01,721 --> 00:24:04,241
She used to come here
to talk about her problems.

362
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:06,281
It was a regular.

363
00:24:07,001 --> 00:24:09,321
We used to console her.

364
00:24:10,001 --> 00:24:12,681
One day, Ragini came here
unexpectedly.

365
00:24:13,081 --> 00:24:14,321
She was all furious.

366
00:24:14,481 --> 00:24:15,841
Who told you about it
through the phone?

367
00:24:15,921 --> 00:24:17,441
He didn't tell the name.

368
00:24:17,801 --> 00:24:19,241
It's just an anonymous call.

369
00:24:19,321 --> 00:24:20,801
I don't care whether
it is anonymous or genuine.

370
00:24:21,121 --> 00:24:22,521
I want to know the truth.

371
00:24:22,881 --> 00:24:27,241
If I knew where she lived,
I wouldn't have bothered you.

372
00:24:27,561 --> 00:24:29,561
What should I say?
Do one thing..

373
00:24:29,881 --> 00:24:32,401
wait here.
I will find where Hari is.

374
00:24:32,601 --> 00:24:34,241
No, that's not enough.
You are close friends.

375
00:24:34,441 --> 00:24:36,721
So, you will try to save him.

376
00:24:37,161 --> 00:24:38,721
It will be a disgrace if someone
comes to know about this.

377
00:24:38,841 --> 00:24:42,201
That's why I came here
without asking anyone else.

378
00:24:42,961 --> 00:24:44,721
Can you show me her house?

379
00:24:44,841 --> 00:24:48,081
Nevertheless, I'll find her.
I will have to ask someone else.

380
00:24:48,161 --> 00:24:49,921
No, don't.

381
00:24:50,161 --> 00:24:51,321
Go with her.

382
00:24:51,401 --> 00:24:52,481
Wait, I'll come.

383
00:25:02,201 --> 00:25:03,321
You can come in as well.

384
00:25:17,841 --> 00:25:21,201
If you are planning
to elope with her

385
00:25:21,721 --> 00:25:23,681
no need to waste your time.
I had to see this.

386
00:25:25,081 --> 00:25:26,161
You want to be a star?

387
00:25:26,841 --> 00:25:30,401
If he is the director, any
tramp like you can become stars.

388
00:25:31,081 --> 00:25:32,961
This is the reason
why the media gossips about you.

389
00:25:33,961 --> 00:25:35,921
And a mother to support her.
- Don't talk rubbish!

390
00:25:36,001 --> 00:25:37,281
Mom, please don't!

391
00:25:38,321 --> 00:25:39,601
What did you..
- Stop it, Ragini!

392
00:25:39,961 --> 00:25:42,201
Don't create a scene here.
- Don't create a scene?

393
00:25:42,361 --> 00:25:45,041
If I don't stop you now,
tell me, when will I?

394
00:25:45,201 --> 00:25:46,361
She is just an artist
who is currently working

395
00:25:46,441 --> 00:25:47,561
in my film.

396
00:25:47,841 --> 00:25:49,521
I have many things
to discuss with her.

397
00:25:50,081 --> 00:25:50,921
You may do as you wish.

398
00:25:51,081 --> 00:25:53,641
But let everyone know
about your discussions.

399
00:25:54,201 --> 00:25:55,721
She is shameless.

400
00:25:56,121 --> 00:25:57,601
People don't know her.

401
00:25:58,681 --> 00:26:01,001
But what about you?

402
00:25:58,681 --> 00:26:01,001
But what about you?

403
00:26:09,881 --> 00:26:12,001
You must have
manipulated her, right?

404
00:26:12,921 --> 00:26:15,521
I didn't know
that your advices were meant

405
00:26:15,721 --> 00:26:16,801
to destroy my family.

406
00:26:17,081 --> 00:26:18,841
What will I gain by doing that?

407
00:26:18,961 --> 00:26:20,041
You might..

408
00:26:20,281 --> 00:26:24,881
If a husband does it..
why can't a wife? Right?

409
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:26,361
Hari!
Don't talk rubbish.

410
00:26:26,481 --> 00:26:28,041
How dare you, dog!

411
00:26:29,001 --> 00:26:30,681
I know what you really are.

412
00:26:31,201 --> 00:26:32,561
You are trying to destroy my
social image

413
00:26:32,641 --> 00:26:34,801
with the intention of getting
attached to her, right?

414
00:26:35,641 --> 00:26:38,481
A film maker is supposed to meet
many people.

415
00:26:38,921 --> 00:26:40,001
Including women..

416
00:26:40,561 --> 00:26:43,641
If you interfere
in my matters again

417
00:26:44,041 --> 00:26:45,481
I will break your spine.

418
00:26:46,481 --> 00:26:47,561
Go inside.

419
00:26:59,721 --> 00:27:01,561
After that we never spoke.

420
00:26:59,721 --> 00:27:01,561
After that we never spoke.

421
00:27:01,961 --> 00:27:04,361
That girl became a star
after her first film.

422
00:27:04,641 --> 00:27:06,521
She became a superstar
after Hari's next film.

423
00:27:07,321 --> 00:27:08,801
But some problems
emerged between the two of them.

424
00:27:08,921 --> 00:27:10,361
I doubt a woman..

425
00:27:12,241 --> 00:27:13,641
It's Ragini.

426
00:27:14,601 --> 00:27:17,441
I don't think
that she can kill a man

427
00:27:17,521 --> 00:27:19,921
like Harikrishnan alone.

428
00:27:20,841 --> 00:27:23,001
There might have been someone
who helped her.

429
00:27:23,561 --> 00:27:24,641
Might be another woman..

430
00:27:25,001 --> 00:27:28,121
or it could
be a man too.

431
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:31,401
If I find evidence
against Ragini

432
00:27:31,801 --> 00:27:36,561
I might even doubt you
as your family was the only one

433
00:27:37,401 --> 00:27:40,681
who was close to Ragini.

434
00:27:43,321 --> 00:27:44,361
Greetings, sir.

435
00:27:45,001 --> 00:27:46,441
The manager went out.

436
00:27:46,601 --> 00:27:49,481
He has to come,
if you want a date for the shoot.

437
00:27:50,401 --> 00:27:51,601
Is Thulasi here?
- Yes.

438
00:27:52,521 --> 00:27:54,161
Where?
- She's inside.

439
00:27:54,841 --> 00:27:55,881
She is applying make-up.

440
00:27:56,041 --> 00:27:57,801
Aren't you Malayalis?
- Yes.

441
00:27:58,081 --> 00:27:59,281
Then why can't you speak
in Malayalam?

442
00:27:59,601 --> 00:28:02,721
We used to work
mainly with Tamilians.

443
00:27:59,601 --> 00:28:02,721
We used to work
mainly with Tamilians.

444
00:28:02,881 --> 00:28:05,481
So, we got adjusted to it.
- Oh!

445
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:07,761
I want to see Thulasi.

446
00:28:07,881 --> 00:28:09,081
It's not possible.

447
00:28:09,481 --> 00:28:11,441
The director is waiting for her.

448
00:28:12,041 --> 00:28:14,281
She must get there
as soon as possible.

449
00:28:15,001 --> 00:28:16,921
Yesterday, she got here at 2 a.m.

450
00:28:17,961 --> 00:28:19,921
You won't get her date this year.

451
00:28:20,081 --> 00:28:21,361
I didn't come here for any date.

452
00:28:21,961 --> 00:28:23,601
I'm a police officer
and I am here to question her

453
00:28:23,721 --> 00:28:25,121
regarding a murder case.

454
00:28:27,921 --> 00:28:29,121
Call her.

455
00:28:29,721 --> 00:28:31,521
Harikrishnan's..
- Yes, right.

456
00:28:32,001 --> 00:28:35,241
Sir, if you question her now, she
will lose her interest to act today

457
00:28:35,521 --> 00:28:36,721
and the shooting
will get cancelled.

458
00:28:37,121 --> 00:28:39,601
We will come in the evening..
- Evening?

459
00:28:40,681 --> 00:28:43,041
I've no time.
Please call her.

460
00:28:43,361 --> 00:28:44,441
She is applying make-up.

461
00:28:44,521 --> 00:28:45,321
That's not a problem.

462
00:29:01,041 --> 00:29:02,361
Sit, please.

463
00:29:04,881 --> 00:29:06,081
Rest of you may go.

464
00:29:11,721 --> 00:29:13,281
Sir, I'm innocent.

465
00:29:13,441 --> 00:29:16,161
The media is the one
who wrote these rubbish.

466
00:29:16,601 --> 00:29:18,881
I swear, I'm innocent.

467
00:29:19,281 --> 00:29:21,281
Did you bribe anyone to halt

468
00:29:21,601 --> 00:29:23,041
Harikrishnan's film shooting?

469
00:29:24,041 --> 00:29:26,921
Did you threaten his wife
through the phone?

470
00:29:27,081 --> 00:29:29,401
You mean.. - Did you tell anyone
that either you or him

471
00:29:29,521 --> 00:29:33,521
will only be there
in the industry next year?

472
00:29:38,361 --> 00:29:40,481
Who told you
about his death?

473
00:29:40,641 --> 00:29:41,761
Someone.
- Someone?

474
00:29:42,321 --> 00:29:43,401
Tell me the truth.

475
00:29:43,721 --> 00:29:45,481
Or else, I'll arrest you right now.

476
00:29:45,601 --> 00:29:47,241
You can shoot your film
in the jail. - No, sir. Please.

477
00:29:47,401 --> 00:29:49,161
I don't know anything.

478
00:29:49,281 --> 00:29:51,841
We were not on good terms.

479
00:29:51,961 --> 00:29:55,641
Other than that, I have
nothing to do with this case.

480
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:58,081
Where were you
when he got murdered?

481
00:29:58,521 --> 00:30:00,441
On the 18th of January?

482
00:29:58,521 --> 00:30:00,441
On the 18th of January?

483
00:30:00,761 --> 00:30:01,801
I was at the shooting.

484
00:30:02,121 --> 00:30:03,481
Where?
Here or in Madras?

485
00:30:03,761 --> 00:30:06,481
Here itself.
I came from Madras on 17th.

486
00:30:06,521 --> 00:30:07,801
Which film were you doing?

487
00:30:08,601 --> 00:30:10,881
It was produced by KR movies.
Directed by Surya Prakash.

488
00:30:11,081 --> 00:30:13,561
What was name of the film?
- 'Share the sadness together.'

489
00:30:14,001 --> 00:30:15,561
Where was the shooting?
- At the beach.

490
00:30:15,641 --> 00:30:16,681
We were filming the duet.

491
00:30:16,761 --> 00:30:19,081
The shooting started
at 6 in the morning

492
00:30:19,201 --> 00:30:20,521
and ended at 2 a.m.

493
00:30:20,881 --> 00:30:23,201
I came to know about the incident
only when my mom told me

494
00:30:23,361 --> 00:30:25,681
in the morning.

495
00:30:26,881 --> 00:30:29,601
Do you use sleeping pills
before you go to sleep?

496
00:30:30,001 --> 00:30:31,041
Yes, sir.

497
00:31:04,481 --> 00:31:06,561
It's been a while, Anil.

498
00:31:06,921 --> 00:31:08,801
I had.. a test.

499
00:31:09,041 --> 00:31:10,161
A test on Computer course.

500
00:31:10,241 --> 00:31:11,721
I was preparing for that.

501
00:31:12,441 --> 00:31:13,721
I had tried to contact Shilpa.

502
00:31:13,881 --> 00:31:14,961
Please, sit.

503
00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:17,041
I think she's sleeping.
I'll call her.

504
00:31:43,321 --> 00:31:44,401
Hello.

505
00:31:46,521 --> 00:31:49,081
You must be mourning your
favourite director's death.

506
00:31:49,241 --> 00:31:51,041
Is that why you have
all his movies here?

507
00:31:53,441 --> 00:31:55,081
Are you still angry with me?

508
00:31:57,321 --> 00:31:58,561
Can we go for a drive?

509
00:31:58,681 --> 00:32:01,521
I will be waiting for you
in the library. Be there.

510
00:31:58,681 --> 00:32:01,521
I will be waiting for you
in the library. Be there.

511
00:32:01,641 --> 00:32:03,481
Why now?

512
00:32:03,641 --> 00:32:05,521
That's not a problem.
Please come.

513
00:32:05,841 --> 00:32:07,321
My teacher will be here soon.

514
00:32:07,441 --> 00:32:09,241
Which teacher?
- My tuition sir.

515
00:32:09,361 --> 00:32:10,841
When?
- Now itself.

516
00:32:11,241 --> 00:32:13,281
He will be here at sharp 12 p.m.

517
00:32:14,401 --> 00:32:16,401
There are still three minutes left.
Let's leave before he comes.

518
00:32:16,481 --> 00:32:17,921
He will he here soon.

519
00:32:18,081 --> 00:32:21,241
My mom corrects the clock according
to his arrival and departure.

520
00:32:21,321 --> 00:32:23,401
We can bunk the class.
Then he will leave.

521
00:32:23,481 --> 00:32:25,441
I have tuition.
That too maths tuition.

522
00:32:25,641 --> 00:32:27,481
I don't know anything about maths.

523
00:32:27,801 --> 00:32:28,961
Don't worry.
I will teach you.

524
00:32:45,761 --> 00:32:47,321
Good afternoon, sir.

525
00:32:47,481 --> 00:32:49,561
Hello, Mr. Anilkumar.

526
00:32:49,721 --> 00:32:50,761
How are you?

527
00:32:51,321 --> 00:32:54,481
Nothing, sir. When teachers like
you go around giving tuitions

528
00:32:54,641 --> 00:32:56,921
it's people like me
who get into trouble. - How?

529
00:32:57,881 --> 00:33:01,401
Well..
We can't afford tuition.

530
00:32:57,881 --> 00:33:01,401
Well..
We can't afford tuition.

531
00:33:01,561 --> 00:33:04,801
Why do students
like you need tuition?

532
00:33:04,961 --> 00:33:07,481
Even without any tuition,
you are a rank holder.

533
00:33:08,761 --> 00:33:09,801
Sir, don't you use a watch?

534
00:33:10,441 --> 00:33:11,441
No.

535
00:33:11,681 --> 00:33:14,401
Are you using a pocket watch
like Gandhi?

536
00:33:15,321 --> 00:33:16,361
No.

537
00:33:16,521 --> 00:33:17,801
Are you wondering
how I am so punctual

538
00:33:17,881 --> 00:33:20,121
without using a watch?
- Yes.

539
00:33:20,841 --> 00:33:22,481
A lot of them have asked me
the same question.

540
00:33:23,041 --> 00:33:25,961
I think, I'll lose my punctuality

541
00:33:26,041 --> 00:33:28,401
if I wore a watch.

542
00:33:29,361 --> 00:33:30,641
Come..

543
00:33:39,721 --> 00:33:41,441
I am ready to buy you a Rolex watch

544
00:33:41,761 --> 00:33:43,281
in order for your time
table to go wrong.

545
00:36:38,521 --> 00:36:40,161
There is no information
about the sender.

546
00:36:41,081 --> 00:36:42,201
It's posted from within the city.

547
00:36:42,561 --> 00:36:43,801
The content is..

548
00:36:44,561 --> 00:36:46,801
'I know you're trying
to avoid me.'

549
00:36:47,561 --> 00:36:50,321
'A man travelling
through a wrong path'

550
00:36:50,881 --> 00:36:52,521
'will try to run away from it.'

551
00:36:53,121 --> 00:36:55,441
'Please, leave me
or let me leave.'

552
00:36:55,761 --> 00:36:58,361
'Or else, you might have to fear me
every time.'

553
00:37:00,161 --> 00:37:01,321
This letter is more like a threat.

554
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:03,801
Look at the handwriting
and tell me whose it is.

555
00:37:06,721 --> 00:37:08,481
It looks like
a woman's handwriting.

556
00:37:08,841 --> 00:37:10,041
It's written by a girl.

557
00:37:10,681 --> 00:37:12,401
I've verified it by the experts.

558
00:37:13,081 --> 00:37:16,721
Do you have any idea
about the identity of the sender?

559
00:37:18,161 --> 00:37:19,361
No, I don't know.

560
00:37:20,961 --> 00:37:22,121
Do you know this girl?

561
00:37:29,841 --> 00:37:31,561
I don't know her.
- Please try to remember.

562
00:37:31,721 --> 00:37:32,881
Haven't you ever seen her?

563
00:37:33,161 --> 00:37:34,321
No.

564
00:37:34,401 --> 00:37:35,441
Are you sure?
- Yes.

565
00:37:36,481 --> 00:37:37,761
It might be a girl
who sent her photo

566
00:37:37,841 --> 00:37:39,321
for the audition.
- No.

567
00:37:39,721 --> 00:37:41,121
She is not from that group.

568
00:37:42,081 --> 00:37:44,241
She might have been selected
from the group.

569
00:37:44,441 --> 00:37:45,441
Maybe.

570
00:37:45,961 --> 00:37:47,321
This is his last diary.

571
00:37:48,001 --> 00:37:50,201
It's from last year
till this January.

572
00:37:50,401 --> 00:37:53,161
He wrote the diary till
November without any fail.

573
00:37:53,601 --> 00:37:57,681
But, it literally ended
after some days.

574
00:37:59,721 --> 00:38:04,521
He stopped writing on November 21st
and he started writing again

575
00:37:59,721 --> 00:38:04,521
He stopped writing on November 21st
and he started writing again

576
00:38:05,001 --> 00:38:06,001
on January 1st.

577
00:38:09,041 --> 00:38:11,481
That was his last note.

578
00:38:12,121 --> 00:38:14,321
He died on January 18th.

579
00:38:14,841 --> 00:38:16,561
Between these dates,
he didn't write anything.

580
00:38:16,681 --> 00:38:18,041
It's practically blank.

581
00:38:18,601 --> 00:38:20,961
We can find a word in some pages.

582
00:38:21,601 --> 00:38:24,881
In the last sheet, he wrote,
'It's January 1st..'

583
00:38:25,481 --> 00:38:28,961
'My dilapidated house
has seen many people come and go.'

584
00:38:29,401 --> 00:38:30,641
'She is coming today.'

585
00:38:30,721 --> 00:38:33,561
'I knew she would come to me
in the end.'

586
00:38:33,761 --> 00:38:35,041
'No matter what.'

587
00:38:35,721 --> 00:38:38,121
'My last 17 years
were full of ignorance.'

588
00:38:38,361 --> 00:38:42,321
'She has awakened my inner self.'

589
00:38:42,801 --> 00:38:44,641
'To become a mere existence
for the rest of my life.'

590
00:38:45,121 --> 00:38:47,361
'She is here with her first
New Year present for me.'

591
00:38:55,161 --> 00:38:57,121
'Today is January 1st..'

592
00:38:58,721 --> 00:39:03,521
'My dilapidated house has
seen many people come and go.'

593
00:38:58,721 --> 00:39:03,521
'My dilapidated house has
seen many people come and go.'

594
00:39:04,561 --> 00:39:05,641
'She is coming today.'

595
00:39:06,281 --> 00:39:09,761
'I knew she would come to me
in the end.'

596
00:39:09,921 --> 00:39:11,401
'No matter what.'

597
00:39:11,721 --> 00:39:15,201
'My last 17 years
were full of ignorance.'

598
00:39:15,481 --> 00:39:17,921
'She has awakened my inner self.'

599
00:39:18,161 --> 00:39:22,841
'To become a mere existence
for the rest of my life.'

600
00:39:23,561 --> 00:39:26,841
'She's here with her first
New Year present for me.'

601
00:39:30,121 --> 00:39:34,321
He is referring to the same girl
in the last page that he wrote.

602
00:39:34,921 --> 00:39:36,321
That is on November 21st.

603
00:39:36,641 --> 00:39:38,321
It starts like..
'Book release..'

604
00:39:38,641 --> 00:39:40,561
'I still have doubts.'

605
00:39:40,841 --> 00:39:43,761
'Is it her?
Please Lord, let it be her.'

606
00:39:44,481 --> 00:39:45,481
That's all.

607
00:39:45,561 --> 00:39:49,561
He wrote this on November 21st.
The letter was posted

608
00:39:49,641 --> 00:39:51,121
on November 23rd.

609
00:39:51,801 --> 00:39:54,001
Can you find any connection
between them?

610
00:39:54,681 --> 00:39:56,041
I don't understand anything.

611
00:39:56,721 --> 00:39:58,961
When I saw the word
book release, I verified it

612
00:39:59,681 --> 00:40:01,481
and found out that,
it was the day on which

613
00:39:59,681 --> 00:40:01,481
and found out that,
it was the day on which

614
00:40:01,681 --> 00:40:03,161
one of his novels was released.

615
00:40:03,561 --> 00:40:04,401
That is right.

616
00:40:05,001 --> 00:40:07,521
Do you remember anything particular
about that day?

617
00:40:07,801 --> 00:40:08,641
I do.

618
00:40:09,441 --> 00:40:12,641
That was the day when
his last novel was released.

619
00:40:12,921 --> 00:40:13,761
Where was it held?

620
00:40:13,841 --> 00:40:14,641
At the Town Hall.

621
00:40:14,921 --> 00:40:16,841
Did you go with him
to the Town Hall?

622
00:40:17,161 --> 00:40:18,161
I did.

623
00:40:18,841 --> 00:40:22,601
Do you normally go with him
for these kind of functions?

624
00:40:22,961 --> 00:40:23,801
No.

625
00:40:23,961 --> 00:40:25,481
Normally, I don't.

626
00:40:26,201 --> 00:40:27,241
In his world that he lives in

627
00:40:28,041 --> 00:40:29,361
and in the reality of that world

628
00:40:30,201 --> 00:40:31,681
I have always felt like a stranger.

629
00:40:32,121 --> 00:40:33,201
He never invited me in to it.

630
00:40:34,521 --> 00:40:35,761
But on that particular day

631
00:40:36,201 --> 00:40:37,681
unexpectedly, he invited me to it.

632
00:40:38,721 --> 00:40:41,521
So, when he invited me that day

633
00:40:42,241 --> 00:40:43,721
I felt really happy.

634
00:40:45,201 --> 00:40:49,201
It was after a long time
that we went out together.

635
00:40:57,401 --> 00:40:59,721
Gentlemen,
the main guest has arrived.

636
00:40:59,801 --> 00:41:01,361
Make way..
- We will start the function soon.

637
00:40:59,801 --> 00:41:01,361
Make way..
- We will start the function soon.

638
00:41:02,601 --> 00:41:03,641
I am a little late.

639
00:41:03,721 --> 00:41:06,081
It is all right.
We can start now. Come on.

640
00:41:07,041 --> 00:41:09,561
Greetings.
- Make way..

641
00:41:13,521 --> 00:41:17,441
Today, we hear that the cinemas
are the art of the century

642
00:41:17,721 --> 00:41:19,401
or the media of the century.

643
00:41:19,721 --> 00:41:21,521
It might be because of
my lack of knowledge

644
00:41:21,961 --> 00:41:26,521
that I can never compare cinema
with any other art forms.

645
00:41:27,041 --> 00:41:28,281
Also, I don't watch cinemas.

646
00:41:35,681 --> 00:41:39,481
Normally, when a writer
enters the world of cinema

647
00:41:39,761 --> 00:41:43,201
he is a great loss for literature.

648
00:41:43,641 --> 00:41:45,081
There are a lot of examples.

649
00:41:45,961 --> 00:41:50,001
We have seen the popularity,
fame and money

650
00:41:50,321 --> 00:41:53,161
the world of cinema provide,
pulling in

651
00:41:53,361 --> 00:41:57,721
so many true writers
with its tentacles.

652
00:41:58,521 --> 00:42:00,681
This is the truth,
no matter what anyone says.

653
00:41:58,521 --> 00:42:00,681
This is the truth,
no matter what anyone says.

654
00:42:01,361 --> 00:42:05,481
We salute Mr. Harikrishnan,
for this achievement of his.

655
00:42:05,881 --> 00:42:10,361
We need to understand one thing.

656
00:42:11,681 --> 00:42:15,641
After staying away
from literature for some time

657
00:42:16,641 --> 00:42:19,281
he has made his comeback

658
00:42:19,601 --> 00:42:22,561
with this big achievement.

659
00:42:31,201 --> 00:42:35,281
This is the biggest achievement,
Malayalam literature

660
00:42:35,601 --> 00:42:37,521
has received in the recent years.

661
00:42:48,361 --> 00:42:49,681
What happened?

662
00:42:49,761 --> 00:42:51,481
I am having a sudden headache
and shivering.

663
00:42:52,241 --> 00:42:53,681
All this excitement might have
increased my blood pressure.

664
00:42:53,761 --> 00:42:56,201
What?
What is it, sir?

665
00:42:56,441 --> 00:42:58,641
There are a lot of doctors
among the audience.

666
00:42:58,961 --> 00:43:00,281
We can have a check-up right here.

667
00:42:58,961 --> 00:43:00,281
We can have a check-up right here.

668
00:43:00,521 --> 00:43:02,081
No.
That will lead to a commotion.

669
00:43:02,281 --> 00:43:04,041
It's all right.
Nobody will know anything.

670
00:43:04,521 --> 00:43:06,361
No. I will leave now.
I am not feeling all right.

671
00:43:06,961 --> 00:43:07,881
You can't go.

672
00:43:08,081 --> 00:43:10,441
The people have come here,
just to here you speak.

673
00:43:10,721 --> 00:43:12,601
That is why they waited this long.

674
00:43:12,721 --> 00:43:14,881
You just have to say a few words.

675
00:43:15,081 --> 00:43:15,921
I am sorry.

676
00:43:18,321 --> 00:43:21,561
Sir.
- To share this happiness with us..

677
00:43:29,441 --> 00:43:31,081
Should I call a doctor?
- No.

678
00:43:34,521 --> 00:43:36,601
Let's call the doctor.
- Didn't I tell you not to?

679
00:43:42,961 --> 00:43:43,761
Hello.

680
00:43:44,401 --> 00:43:45,921
Yes.
We just got here.

681
00:43:47,321 --> 00:43:48,921
It is from the Town Hall.
- Just put it down somewhere.

682
00:43:51,161 --> 00:43:52,921
No.
He is resting.

683
00:43:53,641 --> 00:43:54,761
No, we didn't see a doctor.

684
00:43:55,401 --> 00:43:56,241
We will.

685
00:43:56,561 --> 00:43:57,401
Goodbye.

686
00:44:01,401 --> 00:44:03,521
They said that the people are
making a big fuss over there. - So?

687
00:44:08,921 --> 00:44:09,881
Yes.

688
00:44:10,081 --> 00:44:10,921
I understand.

689
00:44:11,361 --> 00:44:12,201
No, I can't.

690
00:44:12,761 --> 00:44:13,761
My decision is final.

691
00:44:14,601 --> 00:44:15,721
That is none of my headache!

692
00:44:16,201 --> 00:44:17,081
Yes.

693
00:44:19,561 --> 00:44:20,361
What is it?

694
00:44:20,841 --> 00:44:22,281
What happened?
- An earthquake!

695
00:44:22,721 --> 00:44:24,121
Could you people
just leave me alone?

696
00:44:34,481 --> 00:44:36,521
He never came back in to
the bedroom that night.

697
00:44:37,441 --> 00:44:38,521
He didn't eat anything either.

698
00:44:39,441 --> 00:44:40,721
What else happened that night?

699
00:44:41,921 --> 00:44:43,041
What else is there to happen?

700
00:44:44,121 --> 00:44:45,721
I was crying the entire night.

701
00:44:46,921 --> 00:44:48,601
I don't think he slept either.

702
00:44:49,361 --> 00:44:52,681
I could hear him
all through the night.

703
00:44:53,481 --> 00:44:56,561
Do you think he became upset
after seeing someone

704
00:44:56,641 --> 00:44:57,481
in the audience?

705
00:44:59,081 --> 00:45:00,201
That must be it.

706
00:44:59,081 --> 00:45:00,201
That must be it.

707
00:45:03,201 --> 00:45:04,081
'Book release.'

708
00:45:05,001 --> 00:45:06,721
'I am still not sure.'

709
00:45:07,881 --> 00:45:08,921
'Was that really her?'

710
00:45:09,761 --> 00:45:12,281
'Oh, God.
I hope it really was.'

711
00:45:12,921 --> 00:45:14,961
It doesn't seem like he was scared.

712
00:45:15,561 --> 00:45:17,121
'Oh, God.
I hope it really was.'

713
00:45:17,921 --> 00:45:21,441
Doesn't this mean he saw
the person that he wanted to see.

714
00:45:22,121 --> 00:45:25,561
Isn't she the same person
who went to see him

715
00:45:25,801 --> 00:45:28,041
with the first new year gift
after 17 years?

716
00:45:28,921 --> 00:45:31,761
I don't know.
I have only known him for 7 years.

717
00:45:32,961 --> 00:45:35,561
I have never tried
to know about his past.

718
00:45:40,441 --> 00:45:43,681
This is a story Mr. Harikrishnan
recently started writing.

719
00:45:44,281 --> 00:45:45,761
Only a three-quarter
of it is written.

720
00:45:46,321 --> 00:45:47,281
He couldn't complete it.

721
00:45:49,241 --> 00:45:50,081
He hasn't named it.

722
00:45:51,241 --> 00:45:52,201
Have you read it?

723
00:45:53,601 --> 00:45:55,641
No.
Someone seeing his work

724
00:45:56,281 --> 00:45:58,481
without it being finished

725
00:45:59,001 --> 00:45:59,961
is something he never liked.

726
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:02,801
Sometimes,
when he is in a good mood

727
00:46:03,321 --> 00:46:07,841
I have heard him reading it out
to the watchman Appu Pillai.

728
00:46:09,201 --> 00:46:10,681
He has never shown his manuscript
to anyone else.

729
00:46:14,241 --> 00:46:15,481
So, are you saying that

730
00:46:15,881 --> 00:46:19,201
Appu is the only one who knows
what is in this manuscript?

731
00:46:19,561 --> 00:46:21,601
Maybe.
I am not sure.

732
00:46:22,321 --> 00:46:24,281
I noticed it because
of a strange joke.

733
00:46:25,081 --> 00:46:26,561
I got interested
after reading the beginning.

734
00:46:27,161 --> 00:46:29,081
But I didn't finish it.
I just looked through the pages.

735
00:46:29,921 --> 00:46:32,241
Someone dies in the beginning.

736
00:46:32,641 --> 00:46:33,681
Someone popular.

737
00:46:33,961 --> 00:46:36,201
Someone popular as a novelist
and a film director.

738
00:46:36,761 --> 00:46:38,561
And at the peak of his career.

739
00:46:39,401 --> 00:46:40,561
Really?
- Yes.

740
00:46:41,201 --> 00:46:43,041
His name is Shambu.

741
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:47,281
I felt like he knew
he was going to die

742
00:46:47,681 --> 00:46:49,721
when I read the beginning.

743
00:46:50,881 --> 00:46:51,921
Oh, God.

744
00:46:52,121 --> 00:46:53,081
Doesn't that mean

745
00:46:53,161 --> 00:46:55,761
he was afraid
that someone might try to kill him?

746
00:46:56,281 --> 00:46:58,321
Yes.
But who would it be?

747
00:47:01,241 --> 00:47:03,601
Anyway, I am lucky about one thing.

748
00:47:04,521 --> 00:47:07,561
Even if I wasn't able
to see him when he was alive

749
00:47:08,081 --> 00:47:10,241
I was one of his biggest fans.

750
00:47:10,961 --> 00:47:12,001
I really adored him.

751
00:47:13,041 --> 00:47:15,841
I was lucky enough
to be the first one

752
00:47:16,321 --> 00:47:18,441
to read the unfinished manuscript
of his last novel.

753
00:47:19,321 --> 00:47:22,521
Since this book is somewhat
like his autobiography

754
00:47:23,121 --> 00:47:24,761
it might be from this, that I
might be able to find a clue.

755
00:47:25,361 --> 00:47:26,241
Who knows!

756
00:47:50,441 --> 00:47:52,361
This is like a kid
studying before his final exam.

757
00:47:55,041 --> 00:47:56,041
Is it done?

758
00:47:56,441 --> 00:47:57,361
Yes.
- Then?

759
00:47:58,441 --> 00:47:59,361
I have no clue.

760
00:47:59,641 --> 00:48:00,521
That's too bad.

761
00:47:59,641 --> 00:48:00,521
That's too bad.

762
00:48:01,441 --> 00:48:02,641
How is it going?

763
00:48:05,321 --> 00:48:06,681
The investigation is going on
pretty good.

764
00:48:07,921 --> 00:48:10,161
After going from one guy
to another

765
00:48:11,401 --> 00:48:14,641
in the end without realising
who the suspect is

766
00:48:15,121 --> 00:48:17,561
and without any evidence,
the case is fading away.

767
00:48:17,841 --> 00:48:19,441
So, what about all the leads
you got until now?

768
00:48:19,721 --> 00:48:20,641
Those leads are good.

769
00:48:21,801 --> 00:48:24,521
But the vital lead,
the pivotal clue

770
00:48:25,121 --> 00:48:25,921
is getting destroyed.

771
00:48:26,841 --> 00:48:29,201
So, the case is being closed
without any leads.

772
00:48:29,441 --> 00:48:32,881
Suppose, he had
completed the book.

773
00:48:34,161 --> 00:48:37,841
If he did, then we would have
got a clue to who the killer was.

774
00:48:40,361 --> 00:48:43,321
So why can't we think
that there was someone

775
00:48:43,481 --> 00:48:45,841
who didn't want this
novel to be completed?

776
00:48:46,361 --> 00:48:48,841
In that case,
someone should have

777
00:48:48,921 --> 00:48:49,761
seen this manuscript.

778
00:48:50,441 --> 00:48:51,281
That is true.

779
00:48:52,081 --> 00:48:53,961
According to his wife

780
00:48:54,721 --> 00:48:57,081
the only one who could,
is that old watchman.

781
00:48:57,161 --> 00:48:57,961
Okay.

782
00:48:59,441 --> 00:49:01,161
What she said could also be a lie.

783
00:48:59,441 --> 00:49:01,161
What she said could also be a lie.

784
00:49:02,441 --> 00:49:03,321
It could be..

785
00:49:10,041 --> 00:49:11,041
Well..

786
00:49:11,361 --> 00:49:12,961
This is becoming more confusing.

787
00:49:16,161 --> 00:49:18,721
After reading this,
I am afraid of something else.

788
00:49:20,401 --> 00:49:23,121
He died after writing
about his death in the novel.

789
00:49:24,041 --> 00:49:26,361
What if the case also ends up
without any leads

790
00:49:26,441 --> 00:49:27,361
just like in the novel?

791
00:49:28,641 --> 00:49:29,681
What if the same thing happens?

792
00:49:30,041 --> 00:49:31,001
Don't worry about that.

793
00:49:31,641 --> 00:49:32,921
Don't lose your way.

794
00:49:33,361 --> 00:49:35,881
You will get the crucial lead
he missed.

795
00:49:36,721 --> 00:49:37,561
You will.

796
00:49:38,641 --> 00:49:39,961
You are a bright boy.
I know.

797
00:49:42,641 --> 00:49:44,121
I have heard about this girl.

798
00:49:44,761 --> 00:49:45,801
I have seen her once.

799
00:49:46,521 --> 00:49:48,281
But that was about 17 years ago.

800
00:49:50,841 --> 00:49:53,361
But why would he have kept
this photo after all this time?

801
00:49:53,681 --> 00:49:54,561
He might have.

802
00:49:55,321 --> 00:49:57,401
Hari had
all sorts of relationships

803
00:49:57,801 --> 00:49:59,241
with many women.

804
00:50:00,121 --> 00:50:02,761
He had told me about her.

805
00:50:04,041 --> 00:50:07,281
She is the only one that
he had felt any attraction towards.

806
00:50:08,361 --> 00:50:10,961
He really wanted to marry her.

807
00:50:11,721 --> 00:50:12,921
Why didn't that happen?

808
00:50:13,481 --> 00:50:14,321
I don't know.

809
00:50:14,961 --> 00:50:16,561
He never told me,
and neither did I ask him.

810
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:19,601
I thought it would have been
one of his personal secrets.

811
00:50:20,681 --> 00:50:21,521
Who is she?

812
00:50:21,641 --> 00:50:23,081
Before he completely
got in to films

813
00:50:23,601 --> 00:50:25,401
he was a college lecturer.

814
00:50:25,721 --> 00:50:26,961
A very smart English lecturer.

815
00:50:27,761 --> 00:50:30,881
She joined there
as a tutor in his department.

816
00:50:31,121 --> 00:50:32,161
Parvathi.

817
00:50:32,321 --> 00:50:34,201
Do you know in which college
she works right now?

818
00:50:34,521 --> 00:50:35,481
She is not teaching anymore.

819
00:50:36,081 --> 00:50:37,281
She is a saint
in an Ashram right now.

820
00:50:37,921 --> 00:50:39,161
The Ashram
of Poornanandha Mission.

821
00:50:39,841 --> 00:50:42,481
Based on their terminology,
she is a spinster.

822
00:50:46,121 --> 00:50:47,921
Would I get any details
if I go to this place?

823
00:50:48,401 --> 00:50:49,961
You will have to ask
the head office.

824
00:50:50,561 --> 00:50:52,321
It's somewhere near
the Tamil Nadu border.

825
00:50:52,841 --> 00:50:53,961
You will find the main
Ashram there.

826
00:50:54,841 --> 00:50:57,521
Since she is a senior member,
she will most likely be there.

827
00:50:58,161 --> 00:50:59,041
She is here.

828
00:50:59,441 --> 00:51:00,801
But she is not Parvathi
any more.

829
00:50:59,441 --> 00:51:00,801
But she is not Parvathi
any more.

830
00:51:01,481 --> 00:51:02,321
Bhaginisevamayi.

831
00:51:03,041 --> 00:51:04,961
That is how
she should be addressed.

832
00:51:06,001 --> 00:51:07,801
Whatever it is,
can you call her?

833
00:51:09,041 --> 00:51:12,401
I need to know
a little about the reason too.

834
00:51:12,641 --> 00:51:13,921
It is something
that I have to tell her directly.

835
00:51:15,241 --> 00:51:16,601
You are a police officer.

836
00:51:17,761 --> 00:51:19,161
I saw your identity card.

837
00:51:19,721 --> 00:51:20,601
I am convinced too.

838
00:51:21,961 --> 00:51:26,481
But even if you are a police
officer or a police IG

839
00:51:27,001 --> 00:51:31,801
you might not know
the regulations of this Ashram.

840
00:51:32,641 --> 00:51:34,241
But I don't blame you for it.

841
00:51:35,321 --> 00:51:36,641
Please don't think like that.

842
00:51:36,921 --> 00:51:37,961
But..

843
00:51:38,601 --> 00:51:41,201
This Ashram has some disciplines
of its own.

844
00:51:42,401 --> 00:51:46,961
As the head of this place,
nothing happens

845
00:51:47,201 --> 00:51:48,481
without my knowledge.

846
00:51:49,441 --> 00:51:52,601
You should ask me
about anything that concerns them.

847
00:51:53,641 --> 00:51:56,161
So I should ask you the details
about the programs

848
00:51:56,401 --> 00:51:57,481
of Bhaginisevamayi, right?

849
00:51:57,961 --> 00:51:58,801
Yes.

850
00:51:59,321 --> 00:52:01,041
Then Swami, can you tell me
that on 18th of last month

851
00:51:59,321 --> 00:52:01,041
Then Swami, can you tell me
that on 18th of last month

852
00:52:01,481 --> 00:52:02,881
that is on January 18th

853
00:52:03,561 --> 00:52:08,361
whether Bhaginisevamayi was in
this Ashram throughout the day?

854
00:52:08,641 --> 00:52:10,841
For that I have to look
at the program notes and ledgers.

855
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:11,801
Then search them.

856
00:52:18,081 --> 00:52:21,121
Last January 18th

857
00:52:21,721 --> 00:52:24,201
she wasn't at the Ashram
after noon.

858
00:52:24,521 --> 00:52:25,641
When you say after noon

859
00:52:26,401 --> 00:52:28,561
did she come back before sunset?

860
00:52:29,081 --> 00:52:31,921
No. She came back here
the next morning.

861
00:52:32,361 --> 00:52:33,201
Where was she?

862
00:52:33,361 --> 00:52:36,161
Please pardon me.
You should not ask that.

863
00:52:36,641 --> 00:52:39,241
She went for a mission
that I advised her to go.

864
00:52:39,441 --> 00:52:40,961
What mission?
- I am sorry.

865
00:52:41,281 --> 00:52:43,921
I am not supposed to disclose
all those to you. - Swami

866
00:52:44,841 --> 00:52:48,401
I have come here
regarding a murder case.

867
00:52:50,641 --> 00:52:54,721
I got a photo of the Bhagini here,
from the diary of the victim.

868
00:52:55,441 --> 00:52:58,321
You say she wasn't here
at the night of the murder.

869
00:52:59,281 --> 00:53:01,721
There is an Ashram
near Kottiyam

870
00:52:59,281 --> 00:53:01,721
There is an Ashram
near Kottiyam

871
00:53:02,441 --> 00:53:06,041
near Thiruvananthapuram.
I had sent her there.

872
00:53:06,121 --> 00:53:06,921
For what?

873
00:53:07,001 --> 00:53:10,201
For the coordination
of 'Magha Purnima' festival.

874
00:53:10,681 --> 00:53:11,961
She had gone there.

875
00:53:12,841 --> 00:53:15,121
And she had returned with a message
from the Head over there.

876
00:53:17,561 --> 00:53:18,841
I will check that later.

877
00:53:19,361 --> 00:53:20,681
For now, call that woman.

878
00:53:20,961 --> 00:53:22,281
I have to question her.

879
00:53:22,361 --> 00:53:23,281
Sir.
- Please call the lady.

880
00:53:46,161 --> 00:53:47,001
Sit down.

881
00:53:50,201 --> 00:53:51,841
You may go, Swami.

882
00:53:59,081 --> 00:54:01,281
I have come here regarding
a murder case..

883
00:53:59,081 --> 00:54:01,281
I have come here regarding
a murder case..

884
00:54:02,441 --> 00:54:04,321
Miss Parvathi..
- Excuse me.

885
00:54:05,081 --> 00:54:07,121
It will be best if you do not
call me by that name.

886
00:54:07,361 --> 00:54:10,641
You can address me
as Bhagini or Swamini.

887
00:54:11,241 --> 00:54:12,921
If you have a problem with that too

888
00:54:13,281 --> 00:54:14,121
then you can call me Sister.

889
00:54:14,841 --> 00:54:16,881
Anything else is prohibited here.

890
00:54:17,601 --> 00:54:18,441
I just..

891
00:54:18,961 --> 00:54:20,681
One Mr. Harikrishnan

892
00:54:21,241 --> 00:54:23,721
a famous writer and film maker..
- I got to know about it.

893
00:54:24,681 --> 00:54:26,001
In his personal drawer

894
00:54:27,201 --> 00:54:29,321
out of thousands of photographs

895
00:54:29,481 --> 00:54:30,641
I found your photo

896
00:54:31,121 --> 00:54:33,441
in his personal diary, Sister.
That is why I am here.

897
00:54:34,961 --> 00:54:36,681
Do you two..
- We knew each other.

898
00:54:37,201 --> 00:54:38,161
Could you explain?

899
00:54:38,921 --> 00:54:42,441
We worked together for sometime
in a college.

900
00:54:43,481 --> 00:54:47,601
Apart from that, did you two..
- I told you, we knew each other.

901
00:54:49,281 --> 00:54:50,361
That is not what I meant.

902
00:54:51,721 --> 00:54:56,241
I don't know if I should say this
while inside an Ashram.

903
00:54:57,281 --> 00:54:59,961
But there are things
I definitely need to know.

904
00:55:00,601 --> 00:55:01,681
That is why I am asking you.

905
00:55:01,961 --> 00:55:04,801
I got to know about your close
relationship with him.

906
00:55:05,121 --> 00:55:06,721
It was a different experience

907
00:55:07,201 --> 00:55:09,041
of some special days

908
00:55:09,681 --> 00:55:11,361
which had happened
seventeen years back.

909
00:55:12,561 --> 00:55:14,481
Why do you want to know
about it now?

910
00:55:14,561 --> 00:55:15,721
It's essential.

911
00:55:15,761 --> 00:55:18,281
Most of the details you got to know
are true.

912
00:55:19,041 --> 00:55:20,361
Is that the reason behind

913
00:55:20,921 --> 00:55:22,761
you adopting this kind of life?

914
00:55:23,281 --> 00:55:24,521
It could be one of the reasons.

915
00:55:25,281 --> 00:55:28,081
Have you both met after that?
- No.

916
00:55:28,241 --> 00:55:31,961
Has Harikrishnan ever visited
this Ashram? - No.

917
00:55:32,081 --> 00:55:35,121
Have you ever tried to meet him?
- No.

918
00:55:35,481 --> 00:55:37,201
So you never met him?
- No.

919
00:55:37,401 --> 00:55:39,481
Until his death?
- No.

920
00:55:39,881 --> 00:55:40,841
After his death?

921
00:55:43,841 --> 00:55:44,721
No.

922
00:55:44,801 --> 00:55:48,281
Are you sure that you went

923
00:55:48,841 --> 00:55:51,521
to the Kottiyam Ashram
on January 18th? - Yes.

924
00:55:51,961 --> 00:55:53,961
So you spent the night
there itself? - Yes.

925
00:55:54,281 --> 00:55:55,761
You can check
the register there.

926
00:55:56,721 --> 00:55:57,681
Thank you.

927
00:55:58,001 --> 00:55:59,441
I'll check it.

928
00:55:59,761 --> 00:56:01,361
Sorry for the disturbance.

929
00:55:59,761 --> 00:56:01,361
Sorry for the disturbance.

930
00:56:11,401 --> 00:56:13,721
He's not as innocent as you think.

931
00:56:14,161 --> 00:56:17,361
He stalks all
the good-looking girls. - Is it?

932
00:56:17,681 --> 00:56:19,001
That means I'm good-looking.

933
00:56:19,081 --> 00:56:20,321
Look!
I'm warning you.

934
00:56:20,401 --> 00:56:23,681
He smokes, drinks and has now
started injecting heroin too.

935
00:56:23,761 --> 00:56:26,041
Whatever you tell,
he's a smart fellow.

936
00:56:26,121 --> 00:56:28,041
I like him.
He's decent in front of me.

937
00:56:28,121 --> 00:56:29,641
Okay then.
Carry on.

938
00:56:30,081 --> 00:56:33,081
You will soon fall in to his trap.

939
00:56:33,161 --> 00:56:35,641
If he's so smart then his trap
would also be comfortable.

940
00:56:35,721 --> 00:56:37,041
I will prefer that.
- What?

941
00:56:37,441 --> 00:56:40,121
Then what about me?

942
00:56:41,001 --> 00:56:42,801
Make your net better
and stronger to trap me.

943
00:56:42,881 --> 00:56:45,561
Haven't you studied about
survival of the fittest?

944
00:56:45,921 --> 00:56:47,841
No. It would be better
if you teach me.

945
00:56:47,921 --> 00:56:50,361
I don't even know..
- Hey! Get inside the jeep.

946
00:56:52,121 --> 00:56:54,201
You son of a bitch,
are you troubling girls in public?

947
00:56:54,281 --> 00:56:55,961
Come on! Get inside the jeep!
- Sir!

948
00:56:56,521 --> 00:56:57,961
She's my wife, sir.

949
00:56:58,321 --> 00:57:00,361
Is it? - No, sir.
- Then?

950
00:56:58,321 --> 00:57:00,361
Is it? - No, sir.
- Then?

951
00:57:00,561 --> 00:57:04,001
He's been stalking me for some
time now, sir. - What?

952
00:57:04,321 --> 00:57:05,201
Hey..

953
00:57:05,561 --> 00:57:10,121
Two days back I saw you flirting
with a girl at this same spot.

954
00:57:10,201 --> 00:57:12,001
Look! Don't try to worsen
the situation.

955
00:57:12,561 --> 00:57:14,961
I've been trying..
- I am leaving. - Okay.

956
00:57:16,761 --> 00:57:18,241
I think he has fallen into a trap

957
00:57:18,601 --> 00:57:22,441
in the course of his investigation.
- Why?

958
00:57:22,921 --> 00:57:26,201
The investigation has been moving
from one girl to another

959
00:57:26,521 --> 00:57:29,041
and has finally stopped
at a beautiful one.

960
00:57:29,641 --> 00:57:31,881
He has fallen for her.

961
00:57:32,441 --> 00:57:35,921
He was praising her beauty
the whole night yesterday.

962
00:57:35,961 --> 00:57:39,361
During an investigation,
when the culprit is found

963
00:57:39,561 --> 00:57:42,081
the investigation officer
and culprit falls in love.

964
00:57:42,161 --> 00:57:43,921
I'll pester him when I get
to meet him.

965
00:57:44,041 --> 00:57:45,441
No!
Don't do that.

966
00:57:45,641 --> 00:57:46,881
We speak freely with each other.

967
00:57:47,281 --> 00:57:49,521
But if he comes to know that I've
been telling you everything

968
00:57:49,601 --> 00:57:51,921
he might not like it.
- Oh!

969
00:57:52,401 --> 00:57:54,961
Suppose, imagine yourself
in your brother's shoes.

970
00:57:55,041 --> 00:57:58,281
You're a police officer.
Imagine you've got a similar case.

971
00:57:58,641 --> 00:58:02,761
You'll finally find out
that I'm the culprit.

972
00:57:58,641 --> 00:58:02,761
You'll finally find out
that I'm the culprit.

973
00:58:02,841 --> 00:58:05,161
Then what will you do?
- What I will do?

974
00:58:08,961 --> 00:58:10,801
Get lost!
Don't talk to me.

975
00:58:13,601 --> 00:58:16,761
You were right that you were in
Kottiyam Ashram on January 18th.

976
00:58:17,841 --> 00:58:21,081
The register indicates that you
spent the night there.

977
00:58:22,281 --> 00:58:25,361
But you reached there
at around 9 p.m.

978
00:58:26,081 --> 00:58:27,401
'Arrival time, 8:40 p.m.'

979
00:58:29,201 --> 00:58:31,921
You left this place
at around 2 p.m.

980
00:58:32,961 --> 00:58:34,401
If you had left at 2 p.m.

981
00:58:34,801 --> 00:58:37,401
then you would've reached there
at 5 p.m. or 6 p.m. at the most.

982
00:58:38,361 --> 00:58:41,361
If you try to make an excuse
about any accident

983
00:58:41,681 --> 00:58:45,161
then I'll have to approach
the transport office and verify it.

984
00:58:46,121 --> 00:58:47,721
If you don't want to trouble me..

985
00:58:48,081 --> 00:58:50,841
We've taken a pledge to not lie.

986
00:58:51,881 --> 00:58:55,001
That's one of the main rules
to be followed by us.

987
00:58:56,201 --> 00:58:58,761
There was no traffic problem
on the way.

988
00:58:58,881 --> 00:58:59,761
If that is true

989
00:59:00,281 --> 00:59:01,801
then you'll have to tell

990
00:59:02,041 --> 00:59:04,881
where you were between 5 p.m.
to 9 p.m. that day.

991
00:59:05,081 --> 00:59:06,921
You'll have to explain
that absence.

992
00:59:08,481 --> 00:59:09,801
According to the post-mortem
report

993
00:59:10,441 --> 00:59:13,281
Harikrishnan was murdered

994
00:59:13,441 --> 00:59:14,961
between 6 p.m. and 8 p.m.

995
00:59:16,441 --> 00:59:18,361
You have to explain your activities

996
00:59:18,561 --> 00:59:22,761
in those crucial hours between
6 p.m. and 9 p.m. that night.

997
00:59:23,041 --> 00:59:26,281
That's my personal affair.
I can't disclose it.

998
00:59:28,241 --> 00:59:29,041
Okay.

999
00:59:36,921 --> 00:59:38,961
This letter was written by you,
wasn't it?

1000
00:59:46,321 --> 00:59:47,961
Isn't it?
- No.

1001
00:59:48,121 --> 00:59:50,241
But don't you know
the handwriting?

1002
00:59:52,081 --> 00:59:54,161
Don't you know who wrote this?

1003
00:59:54,921 --> 00:59:55,721
I know.

1004
00:59:57,121 --> 00:59:57,921
Who wrote it?

1005
00:59:58,441 --> 00:59:59,641
I won't tell you that.

1006
01:00:13,041 --> 01:00:15,801
These sandals are yours, right?
- No.

1007
01:00:16,081 --> 01:00:18,081
We don't use such slippers

1008
01:00:19,641 --> 01:00:22,121
But haven't you seen these before?

1009
01:00:24,361 --> 01:00:25,241
Try to recollect.

1010
01:00:25,721 --> 01:00:28,161
Where have you seen these slippers?

1011
01:00:30,201 --> 01:00:32,841
Between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m.
that night

1012
01:00:33,201 --> 01:00:35,481
do you remember seeing anyone

1013
01:00:35,681 --> 01:00:38,441
wearing these slippers
by any chance? Have you?

1014
01:00:40,601 --> 01:00:43,681
You're a Sister who has taken
a vow not to lie.

1015
01:00:44,601 --> 01:00:47,281
Don't you remember the person
who was wearing these slippers?

1016
01:00:49,441 --> 01:00:51,521
Yes.
- Who was it?

1017
01:00:51,801 --> 01:00:53,961
I'm sorry.
I can't tell you.

1018
01:00:57,241 --> 01:00:59,761
I don't intend to drag
a person like you

1019
01:01:00,241 --> 01:01:03,201
in to this investigation.

1020
01:01:04,121 --> 01:01:06,961
I personally don't prefer it.

1021
01:01:07,721 --> 01:01:11,561
We've got these slippers and a
handkerchief from the crime spot.

1022
01:01:11,841 --> 01:01:13,801
I've got the handkerchief too.
- Please!

1023
01:01:14,041 --> 01:01:15,201
You don't have to show it.

1024
01:01:15,441 --> 01:01:18,441
The owner of these things
is the murderer.

1025
01:01:19,121 --> 01:01:20,641
And you know the person.

1026
01:01:21,081 --> 01:01:22,321
But you're trying to hide it.

1027
01:01:22,881 --> 01:01:24,601
You're not even making it clear

1028
01:01:24,681 --> 01:01:27,801
about your whereabouts during
those decisive three hours.

1029
01:01:28,361 --> 01:01:29,801
As an investigating officer

1030
01:01:30,201 --> 01:01:31,601
I want an answer to it.

1031
01:01:32,201 --> 01:01:33,961
I'll make you say that.

1032
01:01:35,081 --> 01:01:37,081
You can't pressurize me
to open up.

1033
01:01:38,721 --> 01:01:40,841
Just think before you tell that.

1034
01:01:41,361 --> 01:01:45,041
Because if I don't get an answer
to my question

1035
01:01:45,441 --> 01:01:46,801
you'll be the first person

1036
01:01:47,081 --> 01:01:50,161
to be taken into custody
for this case.

1037
01:01:50,601 --> 01:01:52,561
To take a religious Sister
under custody

1038
01:01:52,761 --> 01:01:55,081
connected to the murder
of a film director

1039
01:01:55,721 --> 01:01:58,481
might be a feast to the media
but not for me.

1040
01:01:59,201 --> 01:02:01,801
Because I don't believe
that you're behind all this.

1041
01:01:59,201 --> 01:02:01,801
Because I don't believe
that you're behind all this.

1042
01:02:02,161 --> 01:02:04,841
You cannot do it.
But you know the murderer.

1043
01:02:05,081 --> 01:02:07,241
I'm sure about it.
- But I don't know.

1044
01:02:10,641 --> 01:02:14,441
When the world comes
to know about it

1045
01:02:14,921 --> 01:02:18,401
it'll be a disgrace to you
and to your Ashram.

1046
01:02:18,481 --> 01:02:20,561
You don't have to bother about it.

1047
01:02:20,801 --> 01:02:22,761
Then you're arrested
from this very moment.

1048
01:02:23,041 --> 01:02:24,201
You're in our custody.

1049
01:02:58,961 --> 01:03:00,601
Mom..
Look at this!

1050
01:02:58,961 --> 01:03:00,601
Mom..
Look at this!

1051
01:03:00,761 --> 01:03:02,321
Sister has been arrested!

1052
01:03:04,041 --> 01:03:05,081
So sad.

1053
01:03:06,041 --> 01:03:08,481
How did this happen?
How did she get involved in this?

1054
01:03:08,801 --> 01:03:12,161
Please call up and ask Anil's
brother, Mom. He arrested her.

1055
01:03:12,241 --> 01:03:15,121
Someone is playing behind this.

1056
01:03:15,841 --> 01:03:18,601
It might be the manipulations
of some other religious group

1057
01:03:19,041 --> 01:03:22,441
to defame the mission!.
- Can you call up and tell

1058
01:03:22,641 --> 01:03:24,121
that we know the Sister, Mom.

1059
01:03:25,041 --> 01:03:27,761
Then we'll have to suffer
as a result.

1060
01:03:28,481 --> 01:03:32,161
With regard to this case,
police have already experienced

1061
01:03:32,201 --> 01:03:33,321
a lot of problems.

1062
01:03:33,521 --> 01:03:35,081
Why should we simply
get into trouble?

1063
01:03:36,321 --> 01:03:39,721
The members of the Ashram
would've got her released by now.

1064
01:03:40,241 --> 01:03:41,361
I'll enquire about it.

1065
01:03:44,081 --> 01:03:47,241
Please, Mom!
Call up and ask Anil's brother.

1066
01:03:47,721 --> 01:03:50,841
I've to attend to the kids
in my tuition class.

1067
01:03:51,041 --> 01:03:53,081
Listen!
I'm leaving.

1068
01:03:53,401 --> 01:03:54,801
You get ready for college.

1069
01:04:08,121 --> 01:04:10,161
Hello.
- Hello. Yes?

1070
01:04:10,281 --> 01:04:13,481
I'm Shilpa here.
- Oh! I was wondering who it was.

1071
01:04:14,081 --> 01:04:16,681
Anil has already left for college.

1072
01:04:17,681 --> 01:04:19,481
Will you be available now?
- Me?

1073
01:04:20,041 --> 01:04:22,121
Why?
I was about to leave.

1074
01:04:22,721 --> 01:04:23,601
You can tell me.

1075
01:04:23,681 --> 01:04:25,201
Can you wait for ten minutes?

1076
01:04:25,761 --> 01:04:27,841
I want to speak to you.

1077
01:04:29,481 --> 01:04:31,361
Will it be inconvenient for you?
I will come soon.

1078
01:04:31,441 --> 01:04:33,241
Okay. Make it fast.
Yes.

1079
01:04:37,001 --> 01:04:39,041
Have you been to the Ashram?
- No.

1080
01:04:39,721 --> 01:04:41,201
Then how do you know her?

1081
01:04:41,681 --> 01:04:43,201
Sister is my mom's friend.

1082
01:04:44,921 --> 01:04:45,921
What do you mean?

1083
01:04:46,201 --> 01:04:49,761
Sister is my mom's
one and only friend.

1084
01:04:50,081 --> 01:04:51,721
I know her very well.

1085
01:04:51,841 --> 01:04:54,121
It's cruel to even doubt her
in this case.

1086
01:04:54,481 --> 01:04:56,161
She's that innocent.

1087
01:04:56,241 --> 01:04:58,441
But all the evidences
are against her, dear.

1088
01:04:58,881 --> 01:05:00,601
The things we retrieved
from the crime scene

1089
01:04:58,881 --> 01:05:00,601
The things we retrieved
from the crime scene

1090
01:05:00,761 --> 01:05:01,841
she knows whom it belongs to.

1091
01:05:02,201 --> 01:05:04,281
But she's not disclosing
the person's identity.

1092
01:05:04,361 --> 01:05:08,041
But she has no relation with him.

1093
01:05:08,321 --> 01:05:10,441
They don't even know each other.

1094
01:05:10,641 --> 01:05:12,281
How do you know?
- I'm sure.

1095
01:05:13,081 --> 01:05:16,801
Harikrishnan had too many illicit
relationships with many women.

1096
01:05:17,321 --> 01:05:19,881
Pretty women were his weakness.

1097
01:05:20,041 --> 01:05:22,841
That's nonsense!
Have you seen anything?

1098
01:05:23,721 --> 01:05:26,241
I'm not sure.
- Nobody has seen anything.

1099
01:05:26,481 --> 01:05:27,961
But they make up stories.

1100
01:05:28,121 --> 01:05:32,081
They're just passing on rumours.
All of you.

1101
01:05:32,401 --> 01:05:35,681
You, my mother and my friends.

1102
01:05:36,161 --> 01:05:37,681
He was nothing like they say.

1103
01:05:38,161 --> 01:05:40,121
He was so great and gentle.

1104
01:05:40,561 --> 01:05:43,481
Did you know him too?
- Yes.

1105
01:05:44,281 --> 01:05:46,401
How?
- Since a long time.

1106
01:05:47,081 --> 01:05:48,121
How long?

1107
01:05:48,761 --> 01:05:52,441
I was his fan, long before
I had met him in person.

1108
01:05:52,961 --> 01:05:56,641
I know about all his works.

1109
01:05:57,081 --> 01:05:59,761
Ever since my mom got a transfer

1110
01:05:59,921 --> 01:06:02,841
as a professor to this city

1111
01:05:59,921 --> 01:06:02,841
as a professor to this city

1112
01:06:03,201 --> 01:06:06,201
it's been my dream to meet him.

1113
01:06:06,921 --> 01:06:08,281
Move..

1114
01:06:08,401 --> 01:06:10,121
Move..

1115
01:06:10,361 --> 01:06:11,401
Yes, move.

1116
01:06:12,641 --> 01:06:13,761
'Peythozhiyaathe.'

1117
01:06:17,241 --> 01:06:20,081
Start camera.
- Running. - Action!

1118
01:06:20,321 --> 01:06:23,921
The branches may touch..
- The branches may touch..

1119
01:06:24,961 --> 01:06:27,401
Since they emerge
from the same branch

1120
01:06:27,561 --> 01:06:30,641
..can dodge it.
- We can dodge it. - Cut!

1121
01:06:31,081 --> 01:06:33,401
Explain the dialogue to her, James!
- Yes, sir.

1122
01:06:33,761 --> 01:06:36,641
Trolley back!
- Understand the meaning first.

1123
01:06:36,961 --> 01:06:38,681
Should the branch run away?
- Sorry, sir.

1124
01:06:39,201 --> 01:06:41,401
We can't dodge..

1125
01:06:41,641 --> 01:06:44,401
We can't dodge..

1126
01:06:45,641 --> 01:06:47,841
Cut it! Camera!
- Take!

1127
01:06:52,041 --> 01:06:53,161
Ready?
- Ready, sir.

1128
01:06:54,961 --> 01:06:55,801
Start camera.

1129
01:06:56,721 --> 01:07:00,321
Running.- Action!
- The branches may touch.

1130
01:06:56,721 --> 01:07:00,321
Running.- Action!
- The branches may touch.

1131
01:07:00,681 --> 01:07:03,321
Since they emerge
from the same branch

1132
01:07:03,441 --> 01:07:06,321
they have no other option.
- Dodge.. - They can't dodge it.

1133
01:07:06,761 --> 01:07:09,561
I admit that I was wrong.
I'm ready to accept it as well.

1134
01:07:10,441 --> 01:07:11,841
I wasn't pointing out a mistake.

1135
01:07:12,081 --> 01:07:14,401
All I said is that
dad over reacted to it.

1136
01:07:14,561 --> 01:07:17,601
Uncle has his own point of view.
He never liked me.

1137
01:07:18,201 --> 01:07:21,361
Everything is a joke for you.
- Cut. Okay.

1138
01:07:23,841 --> 01:07:25,361
Lights off.
- Okay.

1139
01:07:25,481 --> 01:07:28,201
Change the track
for the trolley. - Sir.

1140
01:07:34,721 --> 01:07:36,601
Go ahead.
- I can't.

1141
01:07:45,721 --> 01:07:47,721
Excuse me, sir.
Autograph, please.

1142
01:08:06,921 --> 01:08:08,161
What's your name?
- Shilpa.

1143
01:08:10,401 --> 01:08:11,961
'To Shilpa.'

1144
01:08:15,681 --> 01:08:19,561
Thank you, sir.
- What more do you want?

1145
01:08:20,521 --> 01:08:24,041
Please don't feel
that we are disturbing you.

1146
01:08:24,721 --> 01:08:27,681
If you don't mind, can you
attend our college function?

1147
01:08:29,041 --> 01:08:30,801
I knew it.

1148
01:08:31,361 --> 01:08:33,561
Sorry.
Film stars are available.

1149
01:08:34,121 --> 01:08:36,561
My assistant can

1150
01:08:36,681 --> 01:08:37,881
help you out.

1151
01:08:38,001 --> 01:08:39,321
We don't want them.

1152
01:08:39,641 --> 01:08:43,801
We want you to come.
We are here to invite you.

1153
01:08:44,321 --> 01:08:46,561
I'm the Secretary of the arts club.
- I see.

1154
01:08:47,281 --> 01:08:48,121
Please, sir.

1155
01:08:48,561 --> 01:08:52,481
We all wish for your presence.

1156
01:08:53,241 --> 01:08:55,601
I'm not interested
in delivering speeches.

1157
01:08:55,801 --> 01:08:57,681
Don't you see how busy I am?
- Then don't give a speech.

1158
01:08:57,881 --> 01:08:59,321
Will my presence be enough?

1159
01:08:59,561 --> 01:09:02,241
Yes, sir. You'll only have
to stay for the prize distribution.

1160
01:08:59,561 --> 01:09:02,241
Yes, sir. You'll only have
to stay for the prize distribution.

1161
01:09:02,401 --> 01:09:03,201
That we will arrange.

1162
01:09:03,601 --> 01:09:05,001
When is it?
- On the 14th.

1163
01:09:05,281 --> 01:09:08,041
I'm shooting on the 14th.
- It's only a matter of 15 minutes.

1164
01:09:08,361 --> 01:09:10,881
You can leave as soon as it's over.
- You'll promise me now.

1165
01:09:12,041 --> 01:09:14,241
God promise. It won't last
for more than 15 minutes.

1166
01:09:14,481 --> 01:09:16,401
We understand how
valuable your time is.

1167
01:09:16,961 --> 01:09:18,481
It shouldn't take long.
- It won't, sir.

1168
01:09:18,921 --> 01:09:20,001
The next item

1169
01:09:20,201 --> 01:09:23,641

evening is prize distribution.

Congratulations.

Thank you very much, sir.

1188
01:10:43,521 --> 01:10:46,081
You're a smart girl.
- Sir, wait for a minute.

1189
01:10:46,201 --> 01:10:47,521
I shall drive the car inside.
- Okay.

1190
01:10:48,241 --> 01:10:49,281
See you, sir.

1191
01:10:49,641 --> 01:10:51,601
Where's your native, Shilpa?
- I'm from the North.

1192
01:10:51,921 --> 01:10:53,241
However,
we have a place in the city.

1193
01:10:53,361 --> 01:10:56,281
What about your father?
- I don't have one.

1194
01:10:58,281 --> 01:10:59,081
He's no more.

1195
01:11:00,921 --> 01:11:02,601
He died many years ago.

1196
01:11:02,721 --> 01:11:04,641
Is your mother employed?

1197
01:11:04,881 --> 01:11:06,241
Yes.
She is a professor.

1198
01:11:06,561 --> 01:11:08,361
Does she work here?
- No. At the Government college.

1199
01:11:08,481 --> 01:11:11,881
Is she here today. - No.
She hardly likes my interests.

1200
01:11:12,841 --> 01:11:14,641
So, what about your achievements?

1201
01:11:15,481 --> 01:11:17,321
Aren't they yours?

1202
01:11:18,641 --> 01:11:22,641
Forget what mom has to say.
Talented ones like you are rare.

1203
01:11:23,081 --> 01:11:24,041
You're gifted.

1204
01:11:24,121 --> 01:11:27,721
Develop your skills since
you're quite gifted. - I am trying.

1205
01:11:27,841 --> 01:11:29,521
I'm trying my level best.
- You must.

1206
01:11:30,001 --> 01:11:32,681
Shilpa has a trophy
collection of her own.

1207
01:11:33,241 --> 01:11:36,361
Let's leave before
it gets any more crowded.

1208
01:11:37,321 --> 01:11:39,801
Would you mind if I try
to contact you once in a while?

1209
01:11:40,761 --> 01:11:42,961
I've never been
so inspired by anyone before.

1210
01:11:43,121 --> 01:11:44,641
I have nobody
to mentor me.

1211
01:11:44,881 --> 01:11:46,281
Why not? Please do.
- Thank you.

1212
01:11:46,401 --> 01:11:48,641
Do you have my contact number?
- Yes. Two of them.

1213
01:11:49,321 --> 01:11:51,041
Shooting will last
till the 21st of next month.

1214
01:11:51,121 --> 01:11:52,161
You can contact me once it's over.

1215
01:11:56,441 --> 01:11:58,921
Fancy dress, elocution.

1216
01:11:59,241 --> 01:12:00,681
And this is for mimicry.

1217
01:11:59,241 --> 01:12:00,681
And this is for mimicry.

1218
01:12:03,241 --> 01:12:04,481
This is for short story.

1219
01:12:06,041 --> 01:12:07,681
Tennis.
- Oh.

1220
01:12:07,841 --> 01:12:09,601
How many are there?
- Many.

1221
01:12:11,001 --> 01:12:12,281
Overall championship.

1222
01:12:13,201 --> 01:12:16,161
Do you know who distributed
the prizes? It was Harikrishnan.

1223
01:12:16,441 --> 01:12:18,321
The movie director?
- Yes, the famous.

1224
01:12:19,161 --> 01:12:21,281
The best man to be invited
to a women's college.

1225
01:12:21,401 --> 01:12:22,481
What's wrong in it?

1226
01:12:22,801 --> 01:12:25,841
It was an unanimous
decision among us all.

1227
01:12:26,321 --> 01:12:29,841
We had struggled a lot
to get him just for half an hour.

1228
01:12:30,161 --> 01:12:32,561
So, we can't just blame him.

1229
01:12:32,921 --> 01:12:33,761
You girls must be blamed for it.

1230
01:12:35,721 --> 01:12:37,241
I've heard a lot about him.

1231
01:12:38,201 --> 01:12:41,081
Why do you judge someone

1232
01:12:41,201 --> 01:12:43,561
just because
of what people say?

1233
01:12:43,961 --> 01:12:46,441
He was really decent.

1234
01:12:46,761 --> 01:12:48,041
We all loved him.

1235
01:12:48,361 --> 01:12:50,681
He was great,
handsome and elegant.

1236
01:12:50,921 --> 01:12:53,641
He liked me a lot.
He enquired a lot, too.

1237
01:12:54,201 --> 01:12:56,961
And? - I told him everything.
About you, too.

1238
01:12:57,241 --> 01:13:00,201
What did you tell him?
- Look at you.

1239
01:12:57,241 --> 01:13:00,201
What did you tell him?
- Look at you.

1240
01:13:00,481 --> 01:13:03,481
You fear as if he might
call you right now.

1241
01:13:03,721 --> 01:13:06,801
Why do you have to tell
others about us?

1242
01:13:07,721 --> 01:13:10,641
Don't you know how
to behave with strangers?

1243
01:13:10,801 --> 01:13:13,281
Mom, I'm the Secretary
of the art's club.

1244
01:13:13,441 --> 01:13:14,401
So?

1245
01:13:14,921 --> 01:13:17,961
Mom, you speak as if I did
something wrong.

1246
01:13:18,401 --> 01:13:21,881
It was my dream
to see him in person.

1247
01:13:22,161 --> 01:13:23,161
And it happened today.

1248
01:13:23,481 --> 01:13:27,121
Also, I'm allowed to contact
him once the shooting is over.

1249
01:13:27,441 --> 01:13:29,281
I'm warning you.

1250
01:13:29,681 --> 01:13:32,761
What has happened has happened.
Don't bother contacting him.

1251
01:13:33,161 --> 01:13:36,161
Stupid girls like you
might find him interesting.

1252
01:13:36,561 --> 01:13:37,641
He's a movie director after all.

1253
01:13:38,121 --> 01:13:41,561
Generally they aren't
the best people.

1254
01:13:42,321 --> 01:13:43,681
Especially him.

1255
01:13:44,561 --> 01:13:47,081
Your approach
might have been innocent.

1256
01:13:47,841 --> 01:13:51,081
However,
his intentions can be different.

1257
01:13:51,281 --> 01:13:53,961
I'm capable of figuring it out

1258
01:13:54,281 --> 01:13:57,481
and stopping his friendship
the moment I feel odd about it.

1259
01:13:57,921 --> 01:14:01,321
You better obey my words.
Don't try to get in to trouble.

1260
01:13:57,921 --> 01:14:01,321
You better obey my words.
Don't try to get in to trouble.

1261
01:14:01,801 --> 01:14:03,841
Don't you dare try to contact him.

1262
01:14:04,001 --> 01:14:05,681
Why not?
I will.

1263
01:14:05,961 --> 01:14:09,721
Then you can forget about your
extra-curricular activities.

1264
01:14:14,601 --> 01:14:16,841
All you have to do is ask him
if you need a chance in movies.

1265
01:14:17,321 --> 01:14:20,041
And, he'd for sure
respond to girls like you.

1266
01:14:20,161 --> 01:14:21,401
I'll ask him.

1267
01:14:22,361 --> 01:14:24,081
However,
he has his ways of doing it.

1268
01:14:24,521 --> 01:14:28,321
If you do it his way, you won't
have to waste time on calls then.

1269
01:14:28,441 --> 01:14:30,321
I'll do it as per my convenience.

1270
01:14:31,281 --> 01:14:33,641
Since you have
plans to call him

1271
01:14:33,721 --> 01:14:35,921
he'd for sure invite you over.

1272
01:14:36,041 --> 01:14:38,321
Yeah, right.
Like he's jobless.

1273
01:14:38,441 --> 01:14:41,521
Waiting for girls to call him.
- Wait and watch.

1274
01:14:41,641 --> 01:14:43,441
He'll definitely invite you over.

1275
01:14:43,601 --> 01:14:45,561
I'll meet him if I wish to.

1276
01:14:45,641 --> 01:14:47,681
So what?
- I'll eat you up.

1277
01:14:47,801 --> 01:14:49,921
That's all, right? My bones
would be left behind, right?

1278
01:14:50,041 --> 01:14:53,601
You'll only have to collect
my bones and throw them away.

1279
01:14:53,841 --> 01:14:54,801
You can count on me for that.

1280
01:14:55,041 --> 01:14:57,521
But you must inform me beforehand.
- Of course.

1281
01:15:10,881 --> 01:15:11,961
Hello.
- Hello.

1282
01:15:13,201 --> 01:15:15,081
I don't know if you
remember me, sir.

1283
01:15:15,921 --> 01:15:16,761
I'm Shilpa.

1284
01:15:17,401 --> 01:15:19,801
Yes. I remember you.
The one who won the prize.

1285
01:15:21,721 --> 01:15:22,561
So..

1286
01:15:22,761 --> 01:15:25,361
Nothing.
I thought of calling you..

1287
01:15:26,081 --> 01:15:27,201
Thank you.
- Oh, no.

1288
01:15:27,281 --> 01:15:28,681
It's me who should thank you.

1289
01:15:28,761 --> 01:15:29,641
Then you may.

1290
01:15:31,641 --> 01:15:33,561
All my friends are jealous of me.

1291
01:15:34,201 --> 01:15:36,321
When I told them that
I'll be talking to you.

1292
01:15:36,921 --> 01:15:39,041
Yes.
They can't believe it.

1293
01:15:40,081 --> 01:15:43,401
Listen. Don't call me 'sir'.
It's boring.

1294
01:15:43,921 --> 01:15:45,481
Even I feel so.

1295
01:15:46,201 --> 01:15:48,561
I was thinking of addressing you as
'sir' 2-3 times

1296
01:15:48,921 --> 01:15:52,721
before shifting to calling you
'uncle'.

1297
01:15:52,921 --> 01:15:54,961
Oh, no.
That is way too boring.

1298
01:16:23,081 --> 01:16:25,641
We became close in a very
short span of time.

1299
01:16:26,201 --> 01:16:28,321
He started to like
me very quickly.

1300
01:16:29,001 --> 01:16:33,441
I felt that he was someone
whom I could talk to like a friend.

1301
01:16:40,361 --> 01:16:42,641
He called me a few times.

1302
01:16:42,961 --> 01:16:45,321
I felt that I meant
something to him.

1303
01:16:45,681 --> 01:16:48,081
I had known all his
programs by heart.

1304
01:16:50,361 --> 01:16:52,361
We met a few times outside.

1305
01:16:52,881 --> 01:16:54,401
He enquired about my studies.

1306
01:16:54,921 --> 01:16:57,801
He scolded me when he felt
that I was not attentive in class.

1307
01:16:58,881 --> 01:17:02,881
In this manner, I lost all
my inhibitions about him.

1308
01:16:58,881 --> 01:17:02,881
In this manner, I lost all
my inhibitions about him.

1309
01:17:03,361 --> 01:17:07,121
I swear on God,
he never misbehaved with me.

1310
01:17:11,801 --> 01:17:16,881
People started noticing me in
all the events he participated.

1311
01:17:17,561 --> 01:17:21,961
Every time we met, I felt that he
cared about me more.

1312
01:17:22,521 --> 01:17:24,841
But no one understood us.

1313
01:17:25,241 --> 01:17:26,641
Not even my close friends.

1314
01:17:27,281 --> 01:17:29,161
I didn't bother
correcting them as well.

1315
01:17:30,081 --> 01:17:31,761
I was sure my mom would scold me.

1316
01:17:32,241 --> 01:17:33,961
So I hid everything from her.

1317
01:17:39,641 --> 01:17:40,441
Where are you going?

1318
01:17:40,841 --> 01:17:43,321
For a function at the town hall,
Mom. A literary one.

1319
01:17:43,441 --> 01:17:44,761
All my friends are coming.

1320
01:17:45,081 --> 01:17:46,201
I knew it when I read

1321
01:17:46,321 --> 01:17:48,521
the city program
column in today's newspaper.

1322
01:17:48,601 --> 01:17:50,521
Look how shrewd you are!

1323
01:17:50,721 --> 01:17:53,481
This is not right, Mom.
You're spying on me.

1324
01:17:53,881 --> 01:17:56,681
It's the release function
of a book that guy wrote, isn't it?

1325
01:17:57,361 --> 01:17:59,081
You need not go.
- Why shouldn't I?

1326
01:17:59,481 --> 01:18:01,961
Don't you raise questions.
I told you not to go.

1327
01:17:59,481 --> 01:18:01,961
Don't you raise questions.
I told you not to go.

1328
01:18:05,001 --> 01:18:06,601
I told I'll attend the event.

1329
01:18:06,681 --> 01:18:09,881
To whom? You told whom?
- My friends.

1330
01:18:10,681 --> 01:18:13,081
Did you tell him that
you'll attend the event?

1331
01:18:13,961 --> 01:18:16,001
Did you?
- Yes.

1332
01:18:16,481 --> 01:18:19,041
Oh. So you are still in
contact with him.

1333
01:18:20,761 --> 01:18:22,481
Do you want to destroy your life?

1334
01:18:22,881 --> 01:18:24,281
I haven't done anything wrong.

1335
01:18:24,561 --> 01:18:25,401
And I won't.

1336
01:18:25,601 --> 01:18:26,841
You're talking too much.

1337
01:18:29,961 --> 01:18:31,681
I'll go there no matter what, Mom.

1338
01:18:35,481 --> 01:18:38,361
Then wait for a moment.
I'll come with you.

1339
01:18:39,401 --> 01:18:41,401
I have something to tell him.

1340
01:18:41,761 --> 01:18:44,841
He'll reform only if he
gets a scolding in public. - Come.

1341
01:18:45,081 --> 01:18:48,441
You'll understand his character
only if you meet him in person.

1342
01:18:48,761 --> 01:18:51,441
'The art of this century.
The media of this century.'

1343
01:18:51,561 --> 01:18:54,241
'We've seen movies being
praised like this.'

1344
01:18:54,961 --> 01:18:57,921
'Due to several reasons, I can't
consider movies'

1345
01:18:58,121 --> 01:19:03,161
'to be a form of art.
And I don't watch movies.'

1346
01:18:58,121 --> 01:19:03,161
'to be a form of art.
And I don't watch movies.'

1347
01:19:04,201 --> 01:19:08,041
'Normally, when an author
enters the film industry, we may'

1348
01:19:08,121 --> 01:19:12,401
'say that we've lost an artist.'

1349
01:19:12,481 --> 01:19:14,001
'There are several examples.'

1350
01:19:14,801 --> 01:19:19,681
'This form of media, because
of its popularity, other perks'

1351
01:19:19,921 --> 01:19:23,481
'and money has pulled
several noted authors'

1352
01:19:23,601 --> 01:19:27,961
into itself, phenomenally.'

1353
01:19:28,681 --> 01:19:31,281
'Irrespective of several
justifications..'

1354
01:20:24,681 --> 01:20:29,321
There are quite a few fools
like you to witness their show off.

1355
01:20:31,081 --> 01:20:36,081
I felt that my mom was responsible
for spoiling that event.

1356
01:20:36,761 --> 01:20:40,481
He told me it's not that,
it was because of a headache.

1357
01:20:40,681 --> 01:20:43,361
Still I had called
and apologised to him.

1358
01:20:44,321 --> 01:20:46,321
I was adamant, to everyone.

1359
01:20:46,881 --> 01:20:50,041
He was unavailable,
when I called him after that.

1360
01:20:50,401 --> 01:20:53,441
He might have thought of not
getting in to a mess.

1361
01:20:54,241 --> 01:20:57,961
However, I felt like it was
an attempt to drift apart.

1362
01:20:58,481 --> 01:20:59,881
It hurt me a lot.

1363
01:21:01,761 --> 01:21:03,161
The New Year was approaching.

1364
01:21:03,961 --> 01:21:07,601
I was really happy,
when I found his card

1365
01:21:07,801 --> 01:21:11,441
amidst my friends
Christmas and New Year cards.

1366
01:21:11,881 --> 01:21:16,521
He addressed me as 'dear'
in that card and also signed it.

1367
01:21:16,801 --> 01:21:18,521
I'll keep that
with me till my death.

1368
01:21:19,041 --> 01:21:21,521
I had called him and
informed him when I got it

1369
01:21:21,801 --> 01:21:24,281
that on New Year eve,
on January 1st

1370
01:21:24,641 --> 01:21:27,321
I'll be the first
one gifting him.

1371
01:21:27,561 --> 01:21:29,881
Haven't you gone
to that cottage before? - No.

1372
01:21:30,121 --> 01:21:31,481
I did know the place.

1373
01:21:31,921 --> 01:21:34,241
But neither did he call me,
nor did I go there.

1374
01:21:35,121 --> 01:21:38,401
When I told him I'll be
visiting him, he objected.

1375
01:21:38,881 --> 01:21:41,281
When I forced him,
he agreed finally.

1376
01:21:41,561 --> 01:21:42,481
I convinced him.

1377
01:21:44,961 --> 01:21:46,841
'Today is January 1st.'

1378
01:21:48,521 --> 01:21:53,441
'My dilapidated house has
seen many people come and go.'

1379
01:21:54,401 --> 01:21:55,801
'She is coming today.'

1380
01:21:56,201 --> 01:22:01,241
'I knew she would
come to me in the end.'

1381
01:21:56,201 --> 01:22:01,241
'I knew she would
come to me in the end.'

1382
01:22:17,361 --> 01:22:18,201
Yes.
Come..

1383
01:22:20,201 --> 01:22:23,601
So, prepare a feast for lunch.
- Fine.

1384
01:22:23,721 --> 01:22:25,521
We need sweets..
- Oh, no. It's not needed.

1385
01:22:25,641 --> 01:22:28,721
I'll leave in a while. If my mom
comes to know, I'll be in trouble.

1386
01:22:28,961 --> 01:22:33,081
I told her that I had to prepare
notes and a series of other lies.

1387
01:22:34,601 --> 01:22:36,641
Where is my gift?

1388
01:22:37,321 --> 01:22:39,201
I got it from the temple
after prayers.

1389
01:22:41,801 --> 01:22:45,721
For a year filled with joy,
satisfaction and peace.

1390
01:22:46,041 --> 01:22:49,681
Then, for a creative and
healthy life

1391
01:22:50,081 --> 01:22:52,681
filled with happiness
and prosperity.

1392
01:24:35,241 --> 01:24:36,441
How did your dad die?

1393
01:24:40,321 --> 01:24:43,321
I lied to you.
My dad is not dead.

1394
01:24:44,961 --> 01:24:45,761
What?

1395
01:24:45,881 --> 01:24:48,041
I'm a child born because
of my mom's carelessness.

1396
01:24:48,561 --> 01:24:51,481
My mom loses her temper
when I enquire about him.

1397
01:24:51,801 --> 01:24:56,561
And I'm not interested in knowing
about that man who cheated us.

1398
01:24:58,881 --> 01:24:59,961
Haven't you ever met him?
- No.

1399
01:25:01,041 --> 01:25:03,241
They both got separated,
by the time I was born.

1400
01:25:06,521 --> 01:25:10,641
My mother took me to Nigeria as a
baby after securing a job there.

1401
01:25:11,561 --> 01:25:15,881
She told that she found it
difficult to stay here

1402
01:25:16,201 --> 01:25:17,041
with me in front of her relatives.

1403
01:25:18,361 --> 01:25:20,601
My mother returned when
I turned eight.

1404
01:25:23,201 --> 01:25:25,481
Even to my very close friends

1405
01:25:26,081 --> 01:25:27,121
I've told them that
my father is no more.

1406
01:25:28,121 --> 01:25:29,921
It's a deal between
me and my mother

1407
01:25:30,281 --> 01:25:31,361
that we will say the
same to everyone.

1408
01:25:32,641 --> 01:25:34,441
This is for the first
time I am saying..

1409
01:25:42,001 --> 01:25:42,881
When will you come back?

1410
01:25:42,961 --> 01:25:46,041
Today is the 1st of January.
I'll come back after 17 days.

1411
01:25:46,841 --> 01:25:49,081
What is so special about that day?
- You tell me.

1412
01:25:50,241 --> 01:25:51,161
It's my birthday.

1413
01:25:51,801 --> 01:25:53,441
Is your birthday on
the 18th of January? - Yes.

1414
01:25:53,921 --> 01:25:55,441
Then, you should surely visit me.

1415
01:25:56,121 --> 01:25:58,761
I'll present you something
special on that day.

1416
01:25:59,121 --> 01:26:00,121
A beautiful presentation.

1417
01:25:59,121 --> 01:26:00,121
A beautiful presentation.

1418
01:26:00,201 --> 01:26:03,441
No. It would be difficult for
me to hide it from my mother.

1419
01:26:03,641 --> 01:26:05,001
That is your responsibility.

1420
01:26:05,401 --> 01:26:07,801
I'll surely gift you something.

1421
01:26:08,281 --> 01:26:09,401
You can ask me
whatever you want.

1422
01:26:09,841 --> 01:26:12,681
I am ready to gift you anything.

1423
01:26:13,001 --> 01:26:14,881
That is my privilege, not yours.

1424
01:26:15,441 --> 01:26:17,361
What if I ask for an elephant?
- I'll buy you one.

1425
01:26:17,681 --> 01:26:18,681
The one with a big tusk.

1426
01:26:18,801 --> 01:26:20,041
Should I arrange one?
- No.

1427
01:26:20,081 --> 01:26:22,721
Then, we will have to take the
trouble of arranging food for it.

1428
01:26:23,081 --> 01:26:25,921
Then, tell me what else do
you want? - Should I say?

1429
01:26:26,441 --> 01:26:29,921
Give me a copy of all your books
autographed by you.

1430
01:26:30,401 --> 01:26:31,801
That is one of my dreams.

1431
01:26:32,401 --> 01:26:35,321
Agreed.
I'll gift it to you.

1432
01:26:36,281 --> 01:26:37,041
See you.

1433
01:26:52,321 --> 01:26:53,801
That was the last
time I had met him.

1434
01:26:54,361 --> 01:26:57,241
I couldn't receive
my birthday gift either.

1435
01:26:57,481 --> 01:27:00,041
As my mother did
not allow me to go.

1436
01:26:57,481 --> 01:27:00,041
As my mother did
not allow me to go.

1437
01:27:00,961 --> 01:27:02,441
The same day he got killed.

1438
01:27:04,281 --> 01:27:07,001
He died on the day of my birthday.

1439
01:27:12,521 --> 01:27:15,201
I was thinking of sharing this
with you from that day itself.

1440
01:27:15,641 --> 01:27:17,881
Somehow I couldn't find
the courage to do it.

1441
01:27:18,681 --> 01:27:21,321
Today, when I came to know
that the Sister got arrested..

1442
01:27:22,241 --> 01:27:24,441
They both didn't know each other.

1443
01:27:25,201 --> 01:27:26,561
I am sure about it.

1444
01:27:28,001 --> 01:27:29,601
I like that Sister so much.

1445
01:27:29,961 --> 01:27:31,241
She is a poor soul.

1446
01:28:06,001 --> 01:28:07,361
You must be Shilpa's mother, right?
- Yes.

1447
01:28:07,841 --> 01:28:09,721
I am Anil's brother,
Achuthankutty.

1448
01:28:13,481 --> 01:28:14,281
Have a seat.

1449
01:28:17,081 --> 01:28:18,081
You can continue with your studies.

1450
01:28:24,041 --> 01:28:25,041
Close your door.

1451
01:28:29,561 --> 01:28:31,561
She visited you in the
morning, right? - Yes.

1452
01:28:32,241 --> 01:28:33,041
She told me about it.

1453
01:28:36,481 --> 01:28:39,721
You were aware that Harikrishnan
was Shilpa's father, isn't it?

1454
01:28:42,681 --> 01:28:43,481
Yes, I knew.

1455
01:28:44,601 --> 01:28:46,561
Being her mother I would surely
be aware of it.

1456
01:28:47,481 --> 01:28:48,281
What about this letter?

1457
01:28:54,961 --> 01:28:55,761
It's written by me.

1458
01:28:56,961 --> 01:28:58,721
What about this?
- It's mine.

1459
01:28:59,681 --> 01:29:02,921
This?
- That also belongs to me.

1460
01:28:59,681 --> 01:29:02,921
This?
- That also belongs to me.

1461
01:29:03,401 --> 01:29:05,841
We found this from the crime site.

1462
01:29:06,961 --> 01:29:10,081
We found this letter
from his table. - I know.

1463
01:29:10,761 --> 01:29:15,161
What is the role of Bhaginisevamayi
in this murder?

1464
01:29:16,401 --> 01:29:20,521
I am sure that you are not capable
of doing all this by yourself.

1465
01:29:20,761 --> 01:29:22,281
Parvathi is in no way
involved in this.

1466
01:29:22,801 --> 01:29:24,401
You're simply trying
to trouble her.

1467
01:29:24,561 --> 01:29:25,441
I don't think so.

1468
01:29:26,321 --> 01:29:28,161
She is not answering to
anything in the jail.

1469
01:29:28,361 --> 01:29:30,481
She is not ready to talk to anyone.
- I heard about it.

1470
01:29:31,081 --> 01:29:33,081
To kill someone and to help someone
with the murder

1471
01:29:33,681 --> 01:29:37,681
and also to hide something involved
in it, is all a punishable offence.

1472
01:29:37,761 --> 01:29:38,561
I know.

1473
01:29:38,961 --> 01:29:40,761
Why is she not ready
to take your name

1474
01:29:41,641 --> 01:29:43,521
after knowing that all these
evidences are against you?

1475
01:29:45,041 --> 01:29:46,401
She has such a big heart.

1476
01:29:47,201 --> 01:29:48,961
How did you both get
so close to each other?

1477
01:29:53,041 --> 01:29:57,081
17 years ago, we both worked
closely with each other.

1478
01:29:57,641 --> 01:30:00,721
Three of us were working together
in the same department.

1479
01:29:57,641 --> 01:30:00,721
Three of us were working together
in the same department.

1480
01:30:01,281 --> 01:30:03,721
Was it before Harikrishnan's entry
in to the film industry? - Yes.

1481
01:30:04,401 --> 01:30:06,961
He was also famous back then.

1482
01:30:07,881 --> 01:30:09,801
We used to denote him
as a star lecturer.

1483
01:30:10,521 --> 01:30:12,001
He used to be a hero
figure in front of the girls.

1484
01:30:12,801 --> 01:30:16,681
He used to create sensations with
his creative works back then.

1485
01:30:17,481 --> 01:30:19,521
Girls used to go crazy about him.

1486
01:30:20,641 --> 01:30:23,401
We used to joke about
him in the staff room

1487
01:30:23,881 --> 01:30:28,801
that girls attending his
lectures used to go hysteric.

1488
01:30:29,241 --> 01:30:32,361
You were also very young during
those days. - Yes, I was.

1489
01:30:32,961 --> 01:30:36,881
I used to hate him.
- Why?

1490
01:30:37,761 --> 01:30:39,681
He was a reckless
womaniser in those days.

1491
01:30:41,321 --> 01:30:44,761
Was he like..
- Yes.

1492
01:30:45,601 --> 01:30:49,921
He used to live alone in a rented
house near our college.

1493
01:30:50,961 --> 01:30:53,601
He gave the excuse that
it was for his privacy.

1494
01:30:54,161 --> 01:30:59,241
It was an open secret that most
of the girls who admired

1495
01:30:59,641 --> 01:31:03,481
him used to visit him
in his house regularly.

1496
01:30:59,641 --> 01:31:03,481
him used to visit him
in his house regularly.

1497
01:31:04,601 --> 01:31:08,481
He never used to
stick with one girl.

1498
01:31:09,841 --> 01:31:13,041
Once during one of our college days

1499
01:31:13,641 --> 01:31:17,561
two students started fighting
for him in the backstage.

1500
01:31:19,921 --> 01:31:23,561
We both worked in the same
department for two years

1501
01:31:24,161 --> 01:31:25,561
but still we never
spoke to each other.

1502
01:31:26,921 --> 01:31:29,121
Once Parvathi joined our
department as a tutor..

1503
01:31:31,281 --> 01:31:32,841
She spoiled everything.

1504
01:31:34,361 --> 01:31:35,201
Actually it was not her.

1505
01:31:35,761 --> 01:31:38,401
Her beauty and her charm were
the root cause for everything.

1506
01:31:39,641 --> 01:31:40,761
Also, being such a good soul.

1507
01:31:41,521 --> 01:31:42,601
She was such an idiot.

1508
01:31:42,921 --> 01:31:45,281
How did you got so
close with Parvathi?

1509
01:31:45,881 --> 01:31:48,241
I knew her from my home town.

1510
01:31:48,681 --> 01:31:50,041
We both hailed from the same place.

1511
01:31:50,681 --> 01:31:51,841
Even our families
knew each other.

1512
01:31:52,001 --> 01:31:54,481
Any relation? - No, we were
not related by any means.

1513
01:31:55,401 --> 01:31:57,321
She was the only daughter
of a rich father.

1514
01:31:58,481 --> 01:32:01,321
My father worked as an
assistant to a lawyer.

1515
01:31:58,481 --> 01:32:01,321
My father worked as an
assistant to a lawyer.

1516
01:32:02,161 --> 01:32:03,601
My father had five other
kids apart from me.

1517
01:32:04,881 --> 01:32:07,321
We both shared the same room
in the college hostel.

1518
01:32:08,321 --> 01:32:10,561
Her father had asked me to
take care of her.

1519
01:32:11,441 --> 01:32:13,241
She was staying away from
her house for the first time.

1520
01:32:14,441 --> 01:32:17,121
I was like her local guardian.

1521
01:32:17,721 --> 01:32:19,361
From day one, I was
worried about her.

1522
01:32:19,801 --> 01:32:24,161
I always felt like she took the
initiative of being

1523
01:32:24,961 --> 01:32:27,161
free and frank with that guy.

1524
01:32:28,121 --> 01:32:29,641
I had always warned her.

1525
01:32:30,161 --> 01:32:32,881
Whenever I used to
scold her for doing that

1526
01:32:33,121 --> 01:32:35,081
she used to reply like a kid saying
that there was nothing to worry.

1527
01:32:35,881 --> 01:32:37,201
Although, we lived in the same room

1528
01:32:37,681 --> 01:32:39,041
I found out later that

1529
01:32:39,641 --> 01:32:42,721
their relationship had grown
beyond my expectation.

1530
01:33:10,961 --> 01:33:11,961
I came to know that
you went to advise her.

1531
01:33:12,521 --> 01:33:15,041
So she told you.

1532
01:33:15,561 --> 01:33:17,761
Now, do you feel like giving
me an advice?

1533
01:33:18,241 --> 01:33:19,961
Why are you trying to involve
yourself in our matter?

1534
01:33:20,041 --> 01:33:21,321
I've been given the responsibility

1535
01:33:21,401 --> 01:33:22,801
of taking care of
her by her father.

1536
01:33:23,081 --> 01:33:24,281
I've some responsibility.

1537
01:33:24,841 --> 01:33:27,361
We are adults. We know how
to take care of ourselves.

1538
01:33:28,161 --> 01:33:30,601
You are too smart a person
and she is such an idiot.

1539
01:33:31,081 --> 01:33:33,681
Why are you trying to spoil her?
She is a poor soul.

1540
01:33:33,761 --> 01:33:35,201
How am I spoiling her?

1541
01:33:35,801 --> 01:33:37,361
I will tell that to her parents.

1542
01:33:37,521 --> 01:33:39,481
I will tell them about it.
- You will?

1543
01:33:40,041 --> 01:33:42,041
I know you for such a long time.

1544
01:33:42,721 --> 01:33:44,601
You're that kind of person who
will stop your bike

1545
01:33:44,961 --> 01:33:46,321
on seeing a beautiful
statue wearing a Sari.

1546
01:33:48,721 --> 01:33:50,881
Try to say it more naturally.

1547
01:33:50,961 --> 01:33:51,841
Leela must be a poor soul.

1548
01:33:52,121 --> 01:33:54,561
She is not aware of the
do's and don'ts of this society.

1549
01:33:55,441 --> 01:33:58,081
I was looking everywhere for you.
- Yes.

1550
01:33:58,241 --> 01:33:59,961
I won't be scared if
Appukuttan is with me.

1551
01:34:00,161 --> 01:34:02,641
I am ready to obey Appukuttan.

1552
01:34:02,961 --> 01:34:03,841
See you.
- Okay.

1553
01:34:04,401 --> 01:34:05,761
Leela's father is responsible
for answering this.

1554
01:34:06,641 --> 01:34:07,441
They are overdoing it.

1555
01:34:07,761 --> 01:34:11,121
I've the freedom to decide
whom I want to marry.

1556
01:34:11,721 --> 01:34:13,041
I've informed my family about it.

1557
01:34:13,161 --> 01:34:14,961
Dear, we are poor people.

1558
01:34:15,841 --> 01:34:17,161
Come.
Let's go to our hostel.

1559
01:34:17,441 --> 01:34:18,561
It will get late,
by the time this gets over.

1560
01:34:18,641 --> 01:34:20,521
You may leave.
I'll come with Mridula.

1561
01:34:21,121 --> 01:34:23,441
Why are you so interested in this?

1562
01:34:24,721 --> 01:34:27,321
Your peace of mind is not going to
get affected if you don't see this.

1563
01:34:27,521 --> 01:34:29,081
If you're not interested,
you can leave.

1564
01:34:29,441 --> 01:34:31,081
Why are you disturbing me?

1565
01:34:31,161 --> 01:34:36,321
Students have already started
rumours about both of you.

1566
01:34:36,721 --> 01:34:41,041
Don't stand here with him
and prove them right.

1567
01:34:41,321 --> 01:34:43,841
I'll take care of myself.
Please don't disturb me.

1568
01:34:44,481 --> 01:34:48,201
I am saying this because I've some
responsibilities towards you.

1569
01:34:49,241 --> 01:34:51,721
If you spoil your name here and get
back to your native

1570
01:34:52,321 --> 01:34:55,041
it might not spoil your future
as your dad is a rich man.

1571
01:34:55,801 --> 01:34:57,801
You will surely find
someone to marry.

1572
01:34:58,401 --> 01:35:00,801
Even I belong to the same place.

1573
01:34:58,401 --> 01:35:00,801
Even I belong to the same place.

1574
01:35:01,121 --> 01:35:04,841
I am against this because
this would reflect me too.

1575
01:35:07,041 --> 01:35:09,201
What is your problem?
- I don't have one.

1576
01:35:09,401 --> 01:35:11,121
Then, why are you disturbing
me at my work place?

1577
01:35:11,441 --> 01:35:13,521
I am very well aware of your work.

1578
01:35:14,521 --> 01:35:18,641
These are all your tricks
to be surrounded by girls.

1579
01:35:19,281 --> 01:35:23,521
You used to do this always in the
name of college day and festivals.

1580
01:35:24,201 --> 01:35:26,641
I know the culmination of this too.
Everyone is aware of it.

1581
01:35:26,761 --> 01:35:28,121
Shut up!
- You shut up.

1582
01:35:28,681 --> 01:35:30,961
You may try shouting
at these girls, not me.

1583
01:35:31,561 --> 01:35:34,201
They might be crazy about you.
They might adore you.

1584
01:35:34,641 --> 01:35:36,161
They even might be
hysteric about you.

1585
01:35:36,841 --> 01:35:37,641
I am not like that.

1586
01:35:38,361 --> 01:35:41,321
I hate you.
I feel contempt.

1587
01:35:41,801 --> 01:35:45,121
Even your presence stings me.
Understand that.

1588
01:35:45,161 --> 01:35:45,961
Stop it!

1589
01:35:46,961 --> 01:35:49,161
This is not the place for you
to show off your complex.

1590
01:35:49,561 --> 01:35:50,401
What kind of complex?

1591
01:35:51,041 --> 01:35:53,481
I don't have any kind of complex.

1592
01:35:54,281 --> 01:35:56,241
In every way,
you are inferior to me.

1593
01:35:56,681 --> 01:35:59,081
You're a dirty heap of all
the primitive complexes.

1594
01:35:59,801 --> 01:36:01,081
No men would ever fall for you.

1595
01:35:59,801 --> 01:36:01,081
No men would ever fall for you.

1596
01:36:01,681 --> 01:36:04,961
You are not receiving the reception
that other beautiful girls receive.

1597
01:36:05,921 --> 01:36:08,961
You're talking like this
because of that complex.

1598
01:36:10,601 --> 01:36:12,761
When the best phase of your life
goes like this, then everyone

1599
01:36:13,121 --> 01:36:15,881
will feel such kind
of jealousy and anger.

1600
01:36:16,361 --> 01:36:17,961
But you are not supposed
to take it all out on me.

1601
01:36:19,121 --> 01:36:21,161
If you're that desperate,
then go and stand on the roadside.

1602
01:36:21,561 --> 01:36:25,201
The lorry drivers passing by
would be happy to have you.

1603
01:36:26,721 --> 01:36:27,841
Get lost from here.

1604
01:36:49,521 --> 01:36:51,321
'If you're that desperate,
then go and stand on the roadside.'

1605
01:36:51,841 --> 01:36:55,481
'The lorry drivers passing by
would be happy to have you.'

1606
01:36:56,041 --> 01:36:57,201
'Get lost from here.'

1607
01:37:13,361 --> 01:37:14,161
Yes, come in.

1608
01:37:40,121 --> 01:37:42,361
Are you here to play the role
of a local guardian

1609
01:37:43,921 --> 01:37:46,321
or to apologise for
yesterday's performance?

1610
01:37:47,201 --> 01:37:49,761
Why the hell should
I apologise to you?

1611
01:37:50,561 --> 01:37:51,641
For that you should have
a good pedigree.

1612
01:37:52,241 --> 01:37:55,401
In other words, you should be born
to decent parents.

1613
01:37:55,881 --> 01:37:57,361
Only then, you would
have a good character.

1614
01:37:58,281 --> 01:37:59,521
People coming from
a filthy background

1615
01:37:59,801 --> 01:38:02,441
would have filthiness
in their blood.

1616
01:37:59,801 --> 01:38:02,441
would have filthiness
in their blood.

1617
01:38:03,681 --> 01:38:05,321
If you behave well with me,
then so will I.

1618
01:38:05,801 --> 01:38:08,441
If you behave badly then, I'd go
even lower than your standards.

1619
01:38:14,281 --> 01:38:19,241
You have only met girls who would
rush to share the bed with you.

1620
01:38:19,881 --> 01:38:22,161
Now, you better learn
how to behave with girls.

1621
01:38:31,921 --> 01:38:34,561
It won't be right,
if you leave so easily.

1622
01:38:35,161 --> 01:38:36,961
Since you've acted too smart

1623
01:38:37,401 --> 01:38:39,081
you better see my bedroom
before leaving.

1624
01:38:40,321 --> 01:38:41,481
I really have no interest in you.

1625
01:38:42,081 --> 01:38:45,761
I don't even feel
anything seeing your body.

1626
01:38:46,361 --> 01:38:48,841
I know that you're a third
rate nasty frigid bitch.

1627
01:38:50,561 --> 01:38:55,601
I cannot stand holding my
head held high in front of you

1628
01:38:55,681 --> 01:38:59,881
if you leave so easily
after slapping me.

1629
01:39:01,121 --> 01:39:05,881
And I won't be able to look at
another girl as a man. That's why.

1630
01:41:49,481 --> 01:41:50,321
Leave!

1631
01:41:59,961 --> 01:42:01,881
After that day,
everything got messed up.

1632
01:42:02,961 --> 01:42:06,601
Parvathi left the hostel
and went back home

1633
01:42:07,401 --> 01:42:09,561
without even listening
to my explanation.

1634
01:42:11,001 --> 01:42:14,081
Anyhow, there was nothing
left for me to explain.

1635
01:42:16,201 --> 01:42:19,241
We avoided each other whenever
we met inside the college.

1636
01:42:20,241 --> 01:42:22,041
I avoided him and he avoided me.

1637
01:42:23,161 --> 01:42:24,441
After two weeks

1638
01:42:24,961 --> 01:42:26,641
We heard the news that Parvathi
had joined some Ashram.

1639
01:42:27,601 --> 01:42:28,841
It destroyed me completely.

1640
01:42:30,081 --> 01:42:31,321
It got worse,
when I came to know

1641
01:42:32,041 --> 01:42:34,481
about Harikrishnan's
reaction to that news.

1642
01:42:35,961 --> 01:42:37,201
He resigned his job.

1643
01:42:37,441 --> 01:42:40,761
Is it only because Parvathi joined
the Ashram? - Yes.

1644
01:42:41,601 --> 01:42:44,441
From that day on,
he never came back to college.

1645
01:42:45,241 --> 01:42:49,161
He directly fell into
the world of cinema.

1646
01:42:50,121 --> 01:42:51,881
It was something more
like self-torture.

1647
01:42:52,641 --> 01:42:54,201
Or like an escape.

1648
01:42:54,521 --> 01:42:58,921
You might have been relieved
when he left the college, right?

1649
01:42:59,401 --> 01:43:00,521
Yes, it was.

1650
01:42:59,401 --> 01:43:00,521
Yes, it was.

1651
01:43:01,121 --> 01:43:04,801
But after some days
I understood that

1652
01:43:05,921 --> 01:43:09,921
he left his curse upon me.

1653
01:43:10,281 --> 01:43:14,201
Did you try to contact him?
- No.

1654
01:43:14,961 --> 01:43:19,801
I couldn't even imagine
facing him again.

1655
01:43:21,361 --> 01:43:23,001
I hated him so much.

1656
01:43:23,961 --> 01:43:28,841
My father was a poor soul.
So was my mother.

1657
01:43:29,481 --> 01:43:32,641
Sin and divinity, chastity

1658
01:43:32,881 --> 01:43:35,721
self-respect, motherhood, marriage

1659
01:43:36,281 --> 01:43:41,041
they had raised me with all these.

1660
01:43:41,841 --> 01:43:45,681
I couldn't even imagine
of aborting this child

1661
01:43:45,721 --> 01:43:50,601
and leading a happy life
with someone else.

1662
01:43:51,281 --> 01:43:55,401
I preferred to stay as a
single parent for my child.

1663
01:43:57,401 --> 01:43:58,521
Nobody was aware of
this till the time

1664
01:43:59,121 --> 01:44:00,321
the college closed for vacation.

1665
01:43:59,121 --> 01:44:00,321
the college closed for vacation.

1666
01:44:01,081 --> 01:44:04,481
By the time it reopened,
I took a transfer to Madapalli.

1667
01:44:05,481 --> 01:44:08,961
I forged a story about my husband.

1668
01:44:11,561 --> 01:44:16,401
After giving birth to Shilpa

1669
01:44:16,441 --> 01:44:19,161
I went to Nigeria with
a teaching assignment

1670
01:44:19,521 --> 01:44:23,081
to escape from everyone.

1671
01:44:23,801 --> 01:44:25,201
It was like a long leave.

1672
01:44:25,441 --> 01:44:26,441
Then, when did you return?

1673
01:44:27,361 --> 01:44:28,521
When she turned eight.

1674
01:44:28,961 --> 01:44:30,641
Did you return
thinking that everyone

1675
01:44:31,201 --> 01:44:34,041
would have forgotten about it?
- Yes.

1676
01:44:34,961 --> 01:44:36,201
The first thing I did
after returning

1677
01:44:36,721 --> 01:44:38,801
was meet Parvathi
at the Ashram.

1678
01:44:39,721 --> 01:44:41,161
To ask for her forgiveness.

1679
01:44:41,801 --> 01:44:45,321
But it wasn't required as she was
at a stage where she was ready

1680
01:44:45,841 --> 01:44:48,841
to forgive anyone
for all their sins.

1681
01:44:49,361 --> 01:44:50,761
She started hugging Shilpa

1682
01:44:51,361 --> 01:44:53,041
after knowing that she was
Harikrishnan's daughter.

1683
01:44:54,161 --> 01:44:58,561
I felt like she still loved
him like she had before.

1684
01:44:59,721 --> 01:45:04,521
Shilpa was the real reason
for her to forgive me.

1685
01:44:59,721 --> 01:45:04,521
Shilpa was the real reason
for her to forgive me.

1686
01:45:05,281 --> 01:45:09,041
Since that day, Parvathi was the
only one who used to arrive

1687
01:45:09,281 --> 01:45:10,801
every year on the
day of Shilpa's birthday.

1688
01:45:12,041 --> 01:45:13,601
Did you meet Harikrishnan later

1689
01:45:14,361 --> 01:45:16,121
in that function at the town hall?
- Yes.

1690
01:45:17,481 --> 01:45:20,961
I used to see him constantly in
papers and posters

1691
01:45:21,441 --> 01:45:23,961
and television screens.

1692
01:45:24,681 --> 01:45:26,681
But that day,
I'd met him in person.

1693
01:45:28,121 --> 01:45:31,961
It was a deep shock for me when
I came to know that Shilpa

1694
01:45:32,921 --> 01:45:35,081
was trying to get close to him
in spite of my warning.

1695
01:45:36,081 --> 01:45:38,681
I was worried
whether they would

1696
01:45:38,721 --> 01:45:41,521
involve themselves in an
unwanted relationship.

1697
01:45:42,641 --> 01:45:45,881
Harikrishnan was aware that
Shilpa is his daughter.

1698
01:45:46,761 --> 01:45:51,201
Being her father he could have
had his intuitions. - Yes.

1699
01:45:52,361 --> 01:45:56,521
He was aware of it

1700
01:45:57,561 --> 01:46:00,241
but it got too late,
by the time I was aware of it.

1701
01:45:57,561 --> 01:46:00,241
but it got too late,
by the time I was aware of it.

1702
01:46:03,961 --> 01:46:04,921
Thank you.

1703
01:46:08,361 --> 01:46:09,161
Please come.

1704
01:46:11,521 --> 01:46:13,521
You've received so many gifts.

1705
01:46:13,561 --> 01:46:15,561
My friends were
here in the morning.

1706
01:46:16,321 --> 01:46:17,761
It was such a mess here.

1707
01:46:18,321 --> 01:46:20,881
Everyone were here by dawn itself

1708
01:46:21,401 --> 01:46:23,721
and they just left after lunch.

1709
01:46:24,241 --> 01:46:25,841
Why did you not come
to have lunch with us?

1710
01:46:26,721 --> 01:46:28,361
I couldn't come earlier.

1711
01:46:28,801 --> 01:46:31,241
Even this, I was able to make it

1712
01:46:31,321 --> 01:46:32,481
after connecting
with another program.

1713
01:46:33,281 --> 01:46:35,401
Before evening,
I've to reach Kottiyam.

1714
01:46:35,601 --> 01:46:38,041
No, I won't leave you today.

1715
01:46:45,921 --> 01:46:49,641
Where are you going at this time?
- I'll be back soon.

1716
01:46:50,601 --> 01:46:53,681
It will be evening by
the time you return.

1717
01:46:53,801 --> 01:46:58,161
No. I'll be back
within half an hour.

1718
01:46:59,361 --> 01:47:02,121
Where are you heading so urgently?
- To Laly's house.

1719
01:46:59,361 --> 01:47:02,121
Where are you heading so urgently?
- To Laly's house.

1720
01:47:02,841 --> 01:47:05,081
Laly was here till afternoon.

1721
01:47:05,241 --> 01:47:08,321
Yes, but I had told her that I
would visit her in the evening.

1722
01:47:08,721 --> 01:47:09,521
She would be waiting for me.

1723
01:47:09,921 --> 01:47:12,921
Let her wait.
But you won't go anywhere today.

1724
01:47:14,081 --> 01:47:17,361
I know you are going to meet him.

1725
01:47:19,681 --> 01:47:20,481
Yes.

1726
01:47:20,921 --> 01:47:21,961
Why is it so important to meet him?

1727
01:47:22,321 --> 01:47:23,721
I had told him that
I'll meet him today.

1728
01:47:24,041 --> 01:47:26,401
He must be waiting there
with my birthday gift.

1729
01:47:27,361 --> 01:47:29,081
You shouldn't accept that gift.
- Yes, I will.

1730
01:47:29,481 --> 01:47:32,721
He is waiting there for me after
cancelling all his programs.

1731
01:47:33,081 --> 01:47:35,801
I'll be right back after
accepting his gift.

1732
01:47:36,001 --> 01:47:37,281
You can also accompany
me if you want.

1733
01:47:37,761 --> 01:47:39,841
I cannot cancel it.
I've promised him.

1734
01:47:39,961 --> 01:47:43,521
Shilpa. Stay there.
Stop.

1735
01:47:48,161 --> 01:47:49,241
Leave me.

1736
01:47:56,561 --> 01:47:58,561
I will go.
- You!

1737
01:47:59,201 --> 01:48:01,281
Dear.
- Mom.

1738
01:47:59,201 --> 01:48:01,281
Dear.
- Mom.

1739
01:48:03,241 --> 01:48:05,961
Leave me, Mom.
- Come here.

1740
01:48:06,681 --> 01:48:08,121
You won't go.
- I have to go.

1741
01:48:08,641 --> 01:48:10,481
Come here.
- I need to go.

1742
01:48:12,601 --> 01:48:13,881
Please, Mom.

1743
01:48:20,161 --> 01:48:22,081
Please ask her to leave me.

1744
01:48:24,081 --> 01:48:25,241
You won't go anywhere.

1745
01:48:26,961 --> 01:48:30,081
Mom..
Please open the door.

1746
01:48:30,481 --> 01:48:32,281
Mom.
Please open the door.

1747
01:48:34,881 --> 01:48:35,921
Mom!

1748
01:48:47,761 --> 01:48:52,401
I am scared that something
unwanted might have happened.

1749
01:48:52,641 --> 01:48:54,761
Nothing must have
happened like that.

1750
01:48:55,281 --> 01:48:58,281
She had visited his place once.

1751
01:48:59,121 --> 01:49:01,641
She is too adamant.

1752
01:48:59,121 --> 01:49:01,641
She is too adamant.

1753
01:49:02,161 --> 01:49:07,241
The guy who had spoiled my life,
if he spoils my daughter's life..

1754
01:49:09,521 --> 01:49:12,641
Why don't you tell her everything?
- No.

1755
01:49:13,561 --> 01:49:15,721
It would destroy her life.

1756
01:49:16,801 --> 01:49:19,561
Now, she doesn't have
a father to point at.

1757
01:49:20,281 --> 01:49:22,041
Her father had left her
ever since her birth.

1758
01:49:22,721 --> 01:49:24,841
Now, she has got adjusted to it.

1759
01:49:26,001 --> 01:49:27,001
Let it be like that.

1760
01:49:27,801 --> 01:49:29,081
If she gets to know
the truth

1761
01:49:29,601 --> 01:49:34,641
the people around her,
will have no respect for her.

1762
01:49:35,441 --> 01:49:36,961
People might even start

1763
01:49:37,401 --> 01:49:42,161
looking at her in the wrong way.

1764
01:49:42,721 --> 01:49:43,921
That will hurt her.

1765
01:49:44,681 --> 01:49:45,561
That will destroy her future.

1766
01:49:47,321 --> 01:49:50,081
I might have told her everything

1767
01:49:50,761 --> 01:49:53,281
if he wasn't married to anyone.

1768
01:49:53,921 --> 01:49:57,041
But now after going
through all this

1769
01:49:57,881 --> 01:50:00,201
for all these years,
only for her..

1770
01:49:57,881 --> 01:50:00,201
for all these years,
only for her..

1771
01:50:10,641 --> 01:50:13,481
Please open the door.
Let me attend the phone.

1772
01:50:13,881 --> 01:50:15,081
Please, Mom.

1773
01:50:31,681 --> 01:50:34,001
Hello..

1774
01:50:35,641 --> 01:50:36,441
Hello.

1775
01:51:05,441 --> 01:51:07,161
No.
I won't be late.

1776
01:51:07,521 --> 01:51:10,401
If she feels hungry,
give her some food.

1777
01:51:11,001 --> 01:51:14,881
She won't be ready to eat anything,
but if you say, she won't deny.

1778
01:51:17,681 --> 01:51:19,761
I had told the principal that
I would reach there by 5:30 p.m.

1779
01:51:20,041 --> 01:51:24,721
Now because of this confusion here,
I've to listen to her complaints.

1780
01:51:25,041 --> 01:51:27,321
Will you be back at least
before 7:30 p.m.?

1781
01:51:27,721 --> 01:51:30,401
I need to leave by then.

1782
01:51:30,761 --> 01:51:31,601
I'll be back soon.

1783
01:51:32,081 --> 01:51:35,161
It would take me only 45 minutes.

1784
01:54:54,241 --> 01:54:57,041
Don't shout. Shilpa should
never know about this.

1785
01:55:31,521 --> 01:55:34,001
'To my daughter.
From the father whom you hate.'

1786
01:55:40,961 --> 01:55:41,921
Father.

1787
01:55:49,361 --> 01:55:51,441
'To my daughter.
From the father whom you hate.'

1788
01:56:57,801 --> 01:57:02,161
Immediately,
I had sent Parvathi to the Ashram.

1789
01:56:57,801 --> 01:57:02,161
Immediately,
I had sent Parvathi to the Ashram.

1790
01:57:03,121 --> 01:57:04,561
If she had stayed for the night

1791
01:57:05,361 --> 01:57:08,481
it would've been hard for her.

1792
01:57:09,881 --> 01:57:10,921
Without her knowledge

1793
01:57:11,201 --> 01:57:16,241
I had burned away all his books.

1794
01:57:17,241 --> 01:57:21,241
When I realised that
he had called her over

1795
01:57:21,721 --> 01:57:26,081
to present her with a gift and
to reveal that he was her father

1796
01:57:27,121 --> 01:57:28,481
yet again,
I had failed in front of him.

1797
01:57:30,961 --> 01:57:35,841
The following morning when
she had cried over the news

1798
01:57:36,441 --> 01:57:39,921
I found it hard to console her.

1799
01:57:40,281 --> 01:57:43,801
That was when I felt bad for her.

1800
01:57:44,961 --> 01:57:45,841
Such an unfortunate child.

1801
01:57:46,721 --> 01:57:49,321
Why did you take the knife?
- I don't know why.

1802
01:57:50,761 --> 01:57:53,241
I can't imagine

1803
01:57:54,801 --> 01:57:56,961
what mental state
I was in back then.

1804
01:57:58,121 --> 01:58:02,521
You can say that I intended
to kill him.

1805
01:57:58,121 --> 01:58:02,521
You can say that I intended
to kill him.

1806
01:58:03,801 --> 01:58:05,641
I went to his place

1807
01:58:06,401 --> 01:58:08,401
with the motive to kill him

1808
01:58:08,761 --> 01:58:12,881
by holding all that hatred
in my mind.

1809
01:58:13,801 --> 01:58:14,721
However

1810
01:58:15,761 --> 01:58:16,961
before my arrival

1811
01:58:18,041 --> 01:58:20,961
someone had already killed him.

1812
01:58:24,281 --> 01:58:27,121
Suppose you were there first
one to get there.

1813
01:58:27,801 --> 01:58:31,681
And you happen to see the gift.

1814
01:58:32,241 --> 01:58:33,121
What could've happened?

1815
01:58:34,201 --> 01:58:37,361
I mean, do you feel that

1816
01:58:37,961 --> 01:58:40,481
it could have ended up
as a family reunion?

1817
01:58:41,441 --> 01:58:43,561
If it was that simple,
it would have been better.

1818
01:58:44,761 --> 01:58:46,241
Is there any meaning
to your question?

1819
01:59:18,121 --> 01:59:20,601
Shilpa..

1820
01:59:23,321 --> 01:59:25,881
You could've told
this to me earlier.

1821
01:59:26,281 --> 01:59:27,121
Shilpa.

1822
01:59:31,081 --> 01:59:32,641
Mom..
- Shilpa.

1823
01:59:57,721 --> 02:00:00,161
I'm not able to completely
believe her statements.

1824
01:59:57,721 --> 02:00:00,161
I'm not able to completely
believe her statements.

1825
02:00:01,321 --> 02:00:02,841
There's a loophole somewhere.

1826
02:00:03,881 --> 02:00:06,601
Her claims are based on
a single loophole.

1827
02:00:07,401 --> 02:00:08,481
I have my own doubts.

1828
02:00:10,841 --> 02:00:11,921
Just like that loophole

1829
02:00:12,881 --> 02:00:16,001
and how Hari's novel
ended unresolved

1830
02:00:17,641 --> 02:00:20,041
what if this case remains

1831
02:00:20,321 --> 02:00:22,081
unresolved as well?
- That won't happen.

1832
02:00:23,361 --> 02:00:25,681
I won't give up on this case.

1833
02:00:29,641 --> 02:00:32,121
Those three women
are involved in this case.

1834
02:00:32,921 --> 02:00:33,961
Which three women
are you saying?

1835
02:00:34,241 --> 02:00:35,401
Bhaginisevamayi.

1836
02:00:36,641 --> 02:00:37,721
Your friend's mother.

1837
02:00:38,441 --> 02:00:41,401
And your friend,
Shilpa.

1838
02:00:43,161 --> 02:00:45,321
The mother and her daughter
must be taken into custody.

1839
02:00:46,241 --> 02:00:49,001
They would only speak
the truth at the station.

1840
02:00:49,161 --> 02:00:50,161
But, Shilpa.

1841
02:00:50,321 --> 02:00:51,761
I need to question
her once again.

1842
02:00:52,641 --> 02:00:57,721
She may reveal what her
mother is trying to hide.

1843
02:00:59,281 --> 02:01:00,281
She's a deep woman.

1844
02:00:59,281 --> 02:01:00,281
She's a deep woman.

1845
02:01:01,321 --> 02:01:02,881
In spite of having
all the evidences against her

1846
02:01:03,681 --> 02:01:05,841
she is still trying to get away.

1847
02:01:06,481 --> 02:01:09,841
She won't change her claims.

1848
02:01:10,801 --> 02:01:11,681
Her daughter is just a child.

1849
02:01:12,561 --> 02:01:17,241
She will speak the truth
once we interrogate her.

1850
02:01:17,441 --> 02:01:19,841
Don't arrest Shilpa.

1851
02:01:20,201 --> 02:01:21,681
How about we question her here?
- That won't be enough.

1852
02:01:22,481 --> 02:01:24,761
Some would only speak
the truth inside a police station.

1853
02:01:25,481 --> 02:01:27,281
It's pathetic to trouble her.

1854
02:01:28,121 --> 02:01:30,841
Though she smiles,
she cries inside.

1855
02:01:31,561 --> 02:01:33,761
Nobody knows her,
like I do.

1856
02:01:34,041 --> 02:01:35,441
You're speaking out
of your sentiments for her.

1857
02:01:35,801 --> 02:01:36,761
I need to do my job.

1858
02:01:37,001 --> 02:01:40,521
In this stage, when they heard
Bhaginisevamayi is in custody

1859
02:01:41,201 --> 02:01:43,361
due the fear of spilling the truth

1860
02:01:43,721 --> 02:01:48,401
they're fooling me
with their made up stories.

1861
02:01:48,481 --> 02:01:49,961
That can't happen.
- Please.

1862
02:01:50,801 --> 02:01:52,081
Please don't do this to her.

1863
02:01:52,761 --> 02:01:57,001
If you take her in to custody,
her life would be over.

1864
02:01:57,881 --> 02:02:00,041
She hasn't done anything wrong.

1865
02:01:57,881 --> 02:02:00,041
She hasn't done anything wrong.

1866
02:02:03,521 --> 02:02:06,401
Let me tell you something.
Mind your own business.

1867
02:02:06,681 --> 02:02:07,641
This is none of your business.

1868
02:02:07,961 --> 02:02:08,801
Please don't.

1869
02:02:20,201 --> 02:02:20,961
Hello, is this the police station?

1870
02:02:39,441 --> 02:02:40,281
Anil.

1871
02:02:43,841 --> 02:02:45,761
You don't have to arrest her.

1872
02:02:47,041 --> 02:02:49,561
I am the reason behind his death.

1873
02:03:07,121 --> 02:03:10,961
Is Shilpa home? Could you
call her mom? She knows me.

1874
02:03:25,241 --> 02:03:27,041
Shilpa?
- She's not home.

1875
02:03:27,481 --> 02:03:30,561
She's not home yet? She had told
me that she would be going out.

1876
02:03:30,841 --> 02:03:32,481
But she said that she'd
be back before 5 p.m.

1877
02:03:32,601 --> 02:03:33,521
Didn't I tell you
that she's not home?

1878
02:03:33,961 --> 02:03:35,961
Will she be back soon?
- I don't know.

1879
02:03:36,081 --> 02:03:40,441
Aren't you more aware
of her activities than me?

1880
02:03:40,961 --> 02:03:44,241
She was supposed
to be back by now.

1881
02:03:44,841 --> 02:03:46,841
I shall wait until then.
- No.

1882
02:03:47,361 --> 02:03:48,561
I have guests today.

1883
02:03:50,721 --> 02:03:53,401
Why would my presence matter?
- I don't like it.

1884
02:04:02,521 --> 02:04:04,641
This is her birthday gift.

1885
02:04:05,441 --> 02:04:07,881
Will you please give
it to her on my behalf?

1886
02:04:15,841 --> 02:04:18,561
Probably the movie maker's
gift would be costlier.

1887
02:04:19,441 --> 02:04:21,481
Though your daughter gets back late
after meeting him

1888
02:04:21,921 --> 02:04:23,401
I've realised that
it's none of your concern.

1889
02:04:23,721 --> 02:04:25,161
Publicity is your problem.

1890
02:04:25,761 --> 02:04:26,681
What do you mean?

1891
02:04:27,161 --> 02:04:29,881
Shilpa had informed me that
she'll be at his place.

1892
02:04:30,361 --> 02:04:31,601
I had warned her.

1893
02:04:32,041 --> 02:04:36,361
How would she not go? She
would've been forced by her mom.

1894
02:04:37,161 --> 02:04:39,601
Aren't you ashamed
of sending your daughter

1895
02:04:39,841 --> 02:04:42,241
to a stranger's place?

1896
02:04:42,641 --> 02:04:46,161
It wouldn't matter to you
if she returns home with money.

1897
02:04:46,361 --> 02:04:48,161
Don't shout.
Get out.

1898
02:04:49,161 --> 02:04:50,201
Get out!

1899
02:04:53,081 --> 02:04:55,641
Of course you can make money.
She's young, isn't she?

1900
02:04:55,881 --> 02:04:57,801
I asked you to get out.

1901
02:05:19,361 --> 02:05:20,281
Take a seat.

1902
02:05:29,561 --> 02:05:30,321
Do I know you?

1903
02:05:33,081 --> 02:05:33,881
What do you want?

1904
02:05:37,321 --> 02:05:40,001
Either speak or leave
without being a disturbance.

1905
02:05:41,001 --> 02:05:43,561
I understand that my
presence is a disturbance to you.

1906
02:05:43,841 --> 02:05:45,681
However, that is my intention.

1907
02:05:46,361 --> 02:05:50,961
I don't even know you. Then why
would you want to disturb me?

1908
02:05:51,241 --> 02:05:53,121
No.
But I know you.

1909
02:05:53,441 --> 02:05:54,441
I know everything about you.

1910
02:05:55,001 --> 02:05:58,161
The things that money
and fame makes you do.

1911
02:06:01,321 --> 02:06:04,881
Get up.
Get up!

1912
02:06:06,441 --> 02:06:11,521
Get out! Speak up if you
have anything to say.

1913
02:06:12,081 --> 02:06:14,201
I'll throw you out
if you are high on medication

1914
02:06:14,481 --> 02:06:17,521
and you think you can
act smart in front of me.

1915
02:06:17,961 --> 02:06:19,481
I have nothing to gain
by acting smart in front of you.

1916
02:06:19,641 --> 02:06:20,601
No, right?
- No!

1917
02:06:20,721 --> 02:06:23,481
I'm here to speak to the
girl who is in your room right now.

1918
02:06:23,961 --> 02:06:25,441
I have something to ask her.

1919
02:06:25,561 --> 02:06:26,961
Only then will I leave.

1920
02:06:28,481 --> 02:06:29,801
The girl in my room?

1921
02:06:30,041 --> 02:06:32,761
There's nothing like that.
- I'll decide that.

1922
02:06:33,241 --> 02:06:35,601
Don't you dare enter my room.
- I will.

1923
02:06:35,721 --> 02:06:38,721
No. This is my place
and my house.

1924
02:06:39,081 --> 02:06:41,881
No one is allowed in here
without my permission.

1925
02:06:42,041 --> 02:06:44,521
I will. Or else, why don't
you bring her out?

1926
02:06:44,721 --> 02:06:45,641
I'll take care of the rest.

1927
02:06:47,041 --> 02:06:48,561
Don't you have any shame?

1928
02:06:48,841 --> 02:06:50,241
She's your daughter's age..

1929
02:06:50,361 --> 02:06:51,521
Get lost!

1930
02:06:52,281 --> 02:06:53,121
Get lost!

1931
02:06:55,921 --> 02:06:56,761
Stop!

1932
02:07:46,321 --> 02:07:48,961
Shilpa..
Open the door.

1933
02:07:50,081 --> 02:07:50,961
Shilpa!

1934
02:08:59,761 --> 02:09:00,881
Before I confessed this

1935
02:08:59,761 --> 02:09:00,881
Before I confessed this

1936
02:09:01,321 --> 02:09:04,801
the relationship we had was that

1937
02:09:05,241 --> 02:09:06,361
of a murderer and an investigator.

1938
02:09:08,961 --> 02:09:12,081
Though we had shared
the same house, I feared you.

1939
02:09:13,321 --> 02:09:16,081
Now it feels like
I've got you back.

1940
02:09:17,161 --> 02:09:18,961
Like my fears have vanished.

1941
02:09:21,681 --> 02:09:23,801
Now, I have nothing to fear.

1942
02:09:24,321 --> 02:09:25,801
Nothing at all.

1943
02:09:26,081 --> 02:09:28,441
I'm at peace now.

1944
02:09:32,121 --> 02:09:34,481
My brother must not fail.

1945
02:09:35,681 --> 02:09:38,201
Shilpa must not suffer
because of me.

1946
02:10:16,601 --> 02:10:17,641
Anil!

1947
02:10:25,321 --> 02:10:26,281
Anil!

1948
02:10:50,401 --> 02:10:52,121
'I am the one who murdered
Harikrishnan, the film director.'

1949
02:10:53,241 --> 02:10:56,281
'I am solely responsible
for his death.'

1950
02:10:57,281 --> 02:10:58,441
'I am giving up my life'

1951
02:10:59,321 --> 02:11:04,201
'to avoid the burden that may
fall upon the ones I love.'

1952
02:10:59,321 --> 02:11:04,201
'to avoid the burden that may
fall upon the ones I love.'

1953
02:11:08,361 --> 02:11:11,081
'After reading this,
I am afraid of something else.'

1954
02:11:12,641 --> 02:11:15,161
'He died after writing about
his death in the novel.'

1955
02:11:16,201 --> 02:11:19,481
'What if the case also
ends up without any leads'

1956
02:11:21,041 --> 02:11:22,001
'just like in the novel?'
