1
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,610
- The Priest has arrived. Come on. 
- Welcome.

2
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:07,780
- How are you? 
- We are fine.

3
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:09,790
- Are you doing well? 
- But...where are the kids?

4
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:11,880
Jagmohan.

5
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:13,710
- Junky! 
- Who's calling?

6
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:17,460
Your dad, son!

7
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:19,190
Dad... sorry.

8
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,520
Chandrakant.

9
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,560
Chandu.

10
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,230
Coming, mom.

11
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:28,520
How was she?

12
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:30,090
I didn't see her face.

13
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:33,730
Hello, sir...what took you so long?

14
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:36,060
I mean...were you waiting 
for the wedding night to get over...

15
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:37,440
...and then perform the marriage.

16
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,400
We're already running pretty late.

17
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,650
Let's begin with the final rites.

18
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:41,650
Final rites?

19
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:43,440
It's called veneration.

20
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,890
- Whatever...Let's begin. 
- Sorry.

21
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:48,110
Fireworks shop.

22
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:49,770
Minimum profit.

23
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:52,230
- Seasonal business. 
- Call it seasonal or regional.

24
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:53,370
But at least it's original.

25
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:55,990
And this brilliant idea 
belongs to our friend.

26
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,540
He's an amazing guy.

27
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:58,870
He's a gem.

28
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:01,910
And that's why, 
in this business he's using his brain...

29
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:03,830
...and we're using our name.

30
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:05,330
His hard work...

31
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,740
...and our money.

32
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:10,870
Well, technically your money. 
But we're family.

33
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:12,100
Who is this great guy?

34
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,360
- Let me introduce you. Raj... 
- Kishore.

35
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:16,040
Raj Kishore?

36
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,660
Even I know a guy with two names.

37
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:21,200
But I really hope it's not him.

38
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,160
Him?

39
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,580
He's my friend.

40
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:40,990
When did he get to London?

41
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,870
Oh my, God.

42
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:46,030
People wouldn't keep 
his money in their bank...

43
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:48,200
...and you're letting him work here.

44
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,540
Look at the stars in his horoscope.

45
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:53,700
He isn't just bad luck.

46
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:56,290
In fact, bad luck follows him 
around like a magnet.

47
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:58,870
He's going through 
a terrible bad phase.

48
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:00,330
It must be over now, sir.

49
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:02,790
I admit I've been having terrible 
luck in the past couple of years.

50
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:04,460
That was your good time.

51
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:06,580
The bad phase is just beginning.

52
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:09,790
Hello.

53
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:10,980
Fled?

54
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:15,160
But he was a really nice...

55
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:16,870
Yes, I did...

56
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:19,370
But listen...

57
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:26,540
Niraj Modi has borrowed 
320 billion dollars from our bank.

58
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,830
I n fact, 
I personally sanctioned 6 billion.

59
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,740
And today he fled the country.

60
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:34,740
What about me now?

61
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:41,540
- What have I done? 
- Me?

62
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:43,990
You've been lending him 
money for the past five years.

63
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,700
And without any guarantee.

64
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:46,830
I just joined today.

65
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:49,200
He was here for the last five years.

66
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:52,160
But he fled today 
when you joined the bank.

67
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,290
Niraj Modi is just a tag...

68
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:58,200
This is a result of his bad luck

69
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:04,580
Nonsense, sir... 
Utter nonsense...

70
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:07,450
These planets 
and stars are nonsense.

71
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:10,330
In fact, mom and uncle 
insisted that we call you...

72
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:12,080
...otherwise we would've 
inaugurated our shop on our own.

73
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,160
Absolutely.

74
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,080
You were right, son.

75
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,200
This shop is heading 
for its funeral now.

76
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,200
I mean to say, 
he'll definitely get ruined.

77
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:24,620
But those with him will 
get devastated as well.

78
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:25,700
I don't believe me.

79
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:27,330
- You don't believe it, right? 
- Are you deaf?

80
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:28,870
- You don't believe it, right? 
- Yes, we don't believe me.

81
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:30,700
- Don't believe... 
- What are you doing?

82
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:31,870
What on earth are you doing?

83
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:33,620
It says right here "Smoking Kills".

84
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,330
And still, 
you're turning yourself to dust.

85
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,370
Think about others.

86
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:39,700
Or at least about my shop. 
It's a firework's shop.

87
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:41,450
Come on, chuck it.

88
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:47,450
Remember what I said.

89
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:48,790
Look there.

90
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:51,200
- What the... 
- Chandu.

91
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:54,830
It's doused.

92
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:58,080
Guys, 
I'm warning everyone against it...

93
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,490
...and now you're doing it.

94
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:02,990
- I am not smoking, I was just... 
- Were you taking a selfie?

95
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,910
Hey... 
What are you doing?

96
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:07,040
Not this way, buddy.

97
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:14,330
If you had thrown 
the cigarette that day...

98
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:15,540
...the fireworks 
would've caught fire.

99
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:17,120
Sunny...

100
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,300
The entire shop would've blown up.

101
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:21,290
And the world would've said...

102
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:23,790
...that I am bad luck.

103
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:24,950
Come on.

104
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,330
Sh**

105
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:46,140
Junky! Chandu!

106
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:51,200
Junky! Chandu!

107
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:56,090
"Madness..."

108
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:00,800
"Madness..."

109
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:20,470
"Why do you make so many excuses?"

110
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:28,410
"I am crazy about you."

111
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:34,490
"Why do you make so many excuses?"

112
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:38,330
"I am crazy about you. 
Because..."

113
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:39,990
"I am stuck..."

114
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,910
"This is a strong bond, 
which will never break."

115
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:50,450
"I am stuck on you 
and my heart also skips a beat."

116
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:53,540
"Because you are different."

117
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:07,910
"Careful...or 
love can get you beaten."

118
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:12,040
"Why do you chase me?"

119
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:22,620
"Hold your heart 
or it will catch fire."

120
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:26,080
"Stop flirting with me 
or people are gonna scream."

121
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,700
"Tell the people 
I am your old flame..."

122
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:33,490
"...and I am back to 
lock eyes with you. Because..."

123
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,200
"I am stuck..."

124
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:37,120
"With you, after you."

125
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:44,580
"I am stuck on you 
and my heart also skips a beat."

126
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:49,080
"Because you are different."

127
00:08:55,700 --> 00:09:03,080
"Careful...or 
love can get you beaten."

128
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,330
"Why do you chase me?"

129
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:37,240
Uncle.

130
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:40,240
Uncle. You can stop worrying 
about my marriage now.

131
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:43,830
I've found the man of my dreams.

132
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,740
When this happened?

133
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:49,080
A couple of days ago. 
I was returning from shopping.

134
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,660
Then suddenly...

135
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:57,790
Don't turn around, 
or I'll slice you like a cucumber.

136
00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:02,080
Eyes in front, 
bag at the back, darling.

137
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:03,700
Please...

138
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,120
- Thank you. 
- Goodbye, sweetheart.

139
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,950
Right! Right! Come on.

140
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:09,950
Hey...

141
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,080
Those guys are 
running off with my bag.

142
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:15,490
"When your tresses way..."

143
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:17,080
Don't move.

144
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,240
Or else I'll blow your brains out.

145
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:19,950
What is it? A gun?

146
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,120
- Does it look like a banana to you? 
- Sorry...

147
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:26,870
Stupid oaf...eyes in front, 
bag at the back.

148
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:28,990
Otherwise..

149
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:31,120
Run. Run.

150
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,910
Those guys stole my bag.

151
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:35,910
Then what happened?

152
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:37,200
That's when that hero entered.

153
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,160
Was that hero riding a Segway?

154
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,580
Yes, uncle.

155
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:52,100
Your purse.

156
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:55,410
Thank you, young man.

157
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:57,080
Then he must have 
taken you out for coffee.

158
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,200
Sugar?

159
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:00,660
- Quit. 
- Raj. Raj.

160
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:03,120
You really are 
having a lucky streak.

161
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,200
- Really? 
- Really.

162
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:07,870
Together we started 
a fireworks business.

163
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:09,450
- And do you know what happened? 
- What?

164
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:11,580
The entire market went up in flames.

165
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:15,410
- Flames? 
- Meaning flames of jealousy.

166
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:17,450
My mom and his dad...

167
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:21,580
They were so overjoyed, 
that they kicked us out of our home.

168
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,950
Kicked you out?

169
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,370
I mean...they said go out, 
son, and buy a house of your own.

170
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:28,080
The bigger one.

171
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,580
And now...

172
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:32,700
...we can't leave him at any cost.

173
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:34,870
Promise us...

174
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:37,910
The guy who's dying to finance us...

175
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:39,660
...we're going 
to make him our partner.

176
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:42,370
Make me your partner. 
I am an honest man.

177
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:44,120
I quit sugar a year ago...

178
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,330
...and didn't take a single lump.

179
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:46,540
Don't touch.

180
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:48,870
And my money's completely white...

181
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:51,680
- ...like this female's hair. 
- Wow!

182
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,120
But that's off-white.

183
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,790
So what?

184
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:56,540
Sugar...

185
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:59,160
- Like this sugar. 
- Yeah...

186
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:01,200
Son, he's the same guy Raj Kishore..

187
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:03,950
..with whom I started 
my cement business.

188
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,770
But he's so unlucky, 
that he completely ruined me.

189
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,040
Love and marriage is one thing.

190
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,620
But I hope you didn't 
give him any money.

191
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:12,870
- No, but the bank did. 
- Good!

192
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:14,330
To hell with the bank.

193
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:17,870
But I borrowed the loan in my name 
so I could be their partner in business.

194
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:19,410
What have you done?

195
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:20,870
Uncle, don't fall unconscious.

196
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:22,370
Uncle... Uncle...

197
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,990
Pray that this 
business is successful.

198
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:35,080
Raju, we've been praying 
since the day we met.

199
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,410
- I've even started believing 
in good and bad luck. - Look.

200
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:39,410
Then get on with it. 
Come on.

201
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:43,840
Nice!

202
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,870
Sanjana's become our partner.

203
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,620
Pretty soon I'll make her 
my life-partner.

204
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:57,370
Sister-in-law's expression's 
don't seem to be in your favour.

205
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:00,870
What happened?

206
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:02,290
We know everything...

207
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:05,580
...about the 
guys who stole our bags.

208
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:08,700
I want my money back right now.

209
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:11,950
Otherwise, 
they are not here for decoration.

210
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:14,240
- Okay? 
- Give them the money.

211
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:15,580
Where is it?

212
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:16,870
What?

213
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:18,870
I mean where did you keep it?

214
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:20,410
It's in the truck.

215
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,660
Right.

216
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,200
Thank God we didn't 
spend your money yet.

217
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:27,620
Where did you keep it?

218
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:30,910
Where? It's under the seat.

219
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:33,450
There are only two seats in there. 
Oh, God!

220
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:37,240
I had thought of so many 
things along with this partnership.

221
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:40,990
Which seat did 
you keep it under, Raju?

222
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:45,080
Can't you two see 
that big bag in there?

223
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,700
Do I have to do everything?

224
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:48,450
What a bunch of clowns?

225
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:50,540
Step on it. Come on.

226
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:53,790
- Hey... 
- Come on.

227
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:55,540
Come on.

228
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:56,790
- SIr... 
- Come on.

229
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:57,990
Hurry up.

230
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:09,400
Be careful...

231
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:14,490
Be careful! 
He almost fell out of the truck.

232
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:18,240
- That's not how you drive. 
- You drive.

233
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:19,290
- You drive. 
- No.

234
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:21,870
- You drive... 
- No... you drive.

235
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:23,490
Oh, Sh**

236
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:37,540
Oh, God!

237
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,830
Look out!

238
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,700
- Rascal... 
- Imposter...

239
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:55,290
- Fraud... 
- Cheater.

240
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:57,200
- Stop the truck! 
- We can't stop.

241
00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:58,370
This is our first delivery.

242
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:00,620
And we've invested 
your money in the business.

243
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,370
- All gone? 
- We're doomed.

244
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:04,370
That business was 
your uncle's bad luck.

245
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:07,790
- But we won't let this business flop. 
- Shut up!

246
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,290
This will bring good 
fortune to all of us.

247
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:12,410
Give us one chance, please.

248
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:13,450
Yes...

249
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:15,410
- Who is driving the car? 
- Me.

250
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:16,620
- Get back. 
- They are going to die.

251
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,290
They are all going to die.

252
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,030
Oh no!

253
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:25,360
Stop.

254
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:29,380
- Stupid. 
- Stop.

255
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:31,540
What are you doing?

256
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,240
We are going to die.

257
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:44,540
Sanjana, please go back.

258
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:46,540
For the sake of those thousands 
of kisses, I gave you.

259
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:47,660
Thousands?

260
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:50,080
You said you two only 
kissed a couple of times.

261
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,700
He's uttering nonsense.

262
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:54,490
Stop the truck, Raj. 
I will chase you to the end.

263
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:57,120
You've got a small car 
and an even smaller tank.

264
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,160
How far do you think 
the fuel's going to last?

265
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,870
I always keep my car tanked up.

266
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:02,040
- Uncle... 
- Yes.

267
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,910
We're running out of fuel.

268
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:07,040
You spent all the fuel going 
around with that stupid oaf.

269
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:13,930
- Stop. 
- He's our friend.

270
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:15,540
And you're the enemy.

271
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:18,480
Imagine what 
he'll do to you, stupid.

272
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,160
Sanjana, look out.

273
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:41,090
"Madness..."

274
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,200
Come over this side.

275
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:46,330
- Come on. 
- What are you two doing?

276
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:47,830
Are you mad?

277
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,240
Stop.

278
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:55,490
Careful.

279
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,160
- Hold it. 
- I will drive.

280
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,310
Hail God!

281
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:13,990
- Guys... Guys... 
- Sanjana, run...

282
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,790
Guys... Guys...

283
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,740
Where is the ground?

284
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,910
Raj, you cheat.

285
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:38,580
Even if we have half a 
dozen kids after the wedding...

286
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:40,210
...I still won't forgive you.

287
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:43,120
Wow... 
What an innovative threat?

288
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,280
I was just saying that 
I will never forgive him.

289
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:47,490
- Really. 
- Yes.

290
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:55,580
Come brother-in-law, 
let's celebrate Janvi's birthday.

291
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:00,990
Janvi, my child, my sweetheart.

292
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,450
God bless you, my child.

293
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,370
Many-Many happy returns of the day.

294
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:08,290
Papa, 
you don't love me at all, do you?

295
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,870
- Why? 
- Where is my happy birthday gift?

296
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:12,950
She is coming?

297
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,040
- She? 
- The gift.

298
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,290
Uncle...where is your gift?

299
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:19,870
I am your gift, darling...

300
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:21,950
...which your father has gifted you.

301
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:25,080
By the way, 
we together bought your birthday gift.

302
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:28,160
Your father paid for it 
but it was my choice.

303
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,080
You'll jump with 
joy when you see it.

304
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,370
But first, lets cut the cake.

305
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:32,870
No, no, no...

306
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:35,990
First my gift, then jumping with joy 
and then cake cutting.

307
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,330
- No... 
- Janvi.

308
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:39,950
- Janvi. 
- Janvi.

309
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:44,700
Where are the bloody delivery guys?

310
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,760
They has come borther-in-law. 
They has come.

311
00:18:57,990 --> 00:19:00,120
Big words from a weak stomach, sir. 
But I've some bad news.

312
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,620
Not now.

313
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,750
Our casinos have been raided.

314
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:05,120
Dammit.

315
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,620
And our men are in custody.

316
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:13,240
I think Tulli and 
Bulli are behind this.

317
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:15,490
Control your anger, brother-in-law. 
It's your daughter's birthday.

318
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:17,540
Let her first cut the cake 
then we'll cut to the action sequence.

319
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:18,910
What do you want to say?

320
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:22,740
Smile. 
Smile, brother-in-law.

321
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,540
What took you guys so long?

322
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:29,950
It was a pretty long journey, 
plus the traffic...

323
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,160
...heavy vehicles 
other cars chasing us.

324
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,490
What took us?

325
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:36,540
And we weren't exactly supposed to match 
time and exchange bags like smugglers.

326
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:37,700
Yeah...

327
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:39,830
What?

328
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,700
What's with the look?

329
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:42,870
Are you trying to scare me?

330
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:44,910
We're already in a bad mood.

331
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:47,540
Here's the bill. Pay up.

332
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:51,450
Who is firing?

333
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:54,200
Check where it's coming from?

334
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:56,080
Who is firing?

335
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,040
FInd out. Come on.

336
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,330
That's Raja sir.

337
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:00,740
And that's...WiFi.

338
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:03,370
They are underworld Dons. Got it.

339
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:05,990
I saw WiFi's picture in 
the newspaper holding a gun.

340
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,790
They have been 
terrorising the place.

341
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:09,620
Who is the one with the death wish?

342
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:10,450
Why didn't you tell us earlier?

343
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:13,250
I just realised after 
seeing the gun... I didn't know.

344
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:14,580
Uncle.

345
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:15,740
Uncle.

346
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:17,620
It was just a balloon. 
Balloon...

347
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,290
Like this.

348
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,490
Scared of a balloon.

349
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:23,690
Balloon.

350
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,040
The gift's arrived, 
should you cut the cake now?

351
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,620
Very sorry for being late.

352
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:34,080
If only we had known. 
we would've arrived two days earlier.

353
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,830
- Really? 
- Yes.

354
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:37,200
Birthday.

355
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:39,160
Happy birthday, sir.

356
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:40,740
Sh**

357
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:42,410
It's not my birthday.

358
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,660
It's my daughter's birthday. 
And she is angry.

359
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:47,330
We'll cajole her.

360
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:50,660
Convince her. 
We'll convince her.

361
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:52,040
- Excuse me. 
- Good!

362
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:54,870
Happy birthday, ma'am.

363
00:20:56,370 --> 00:20:57,580
Ma'am.

364
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,290
Please...

365
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,290
Please...

366
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:08,870
Daughter...

367
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:24,910
Janvi madam, here's your gift.

368
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:26,580
So small.

369
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,700
That's not the gift. That is.

370
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:30,120
- That? 
- That...

371
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,620
That's just a jalopy.

372
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:34,080
Gift wrap. The gift's inside.

373
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,160
- Is it? 
- Yes.

374
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,200
Press this.

375
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:44,200
Happy birthday. 
World's best sports car.

376
00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:00,080
Oh, Sh**

377
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:16,910
- Daughter... 
- No!

378
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:27,830
Wait, dear. Cut the cake.

379
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:28,820
No!

380
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:31,450
Mr. Wifi... Bill...

381
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:43,380
How can you treat these poor 
guys like this, brother-in-law?

382
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:45,300
They are humans 
and its only human to err.

383
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:46,620
Poor fellows...

384
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,640
They will develop pneumonia 
in this British weather.

385
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,220
Who is this angel?

386
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:53,510
- Is it Mr. India? 
- Is that why we can't see him?

387
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:57,300
- Where are our red glasses? 
- Where are our red glasses?

388
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:59,800
- Take them out. 
- Yes. Take us out.

389
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:02,630
That car was worth 70 million.

390
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:09,130
If we sell their kidneys, 
livers, eyeballs, pancreas...

391
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:14,170
...on the black market, 
we'll still never recover 70 million.

392
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:16,090
Our market value isn't even close.

393
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:18,050
- I know it, dear. 
- Enough!

394
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:22,050
Do something about 
my men and my casinos...

395
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:25,170
...or else I will shoot all of you.

396
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:27,840
Raja sir has been pulling 
his own hair in a fit of rage...

397
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:30,380
- ...and you can see the result. 
- Yes, sir.

398
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:32,590
That bald patch is 
narrating its own story.

399
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:36,550
Hey! Do you guys want a job?

400
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,550
Will we get paid?

401
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,840
One million each.

402
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:42,920
Nice. Thank you.

403
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:44,220
But you won't get anything in hand.

404
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,760
We'll use it to cover the damages.

405
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,300
What are we going to eat?

406
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:48,340
What are we going to wear?

407
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:51,720
Food, clothes, 
travel, and conveyance will be on us.

408
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,420
Give me a hug.

409
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:55,720
- Dear... 
- This man has a heart of gold.

410
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,580
- You're like my mom. 
- I know it. Stop buttering me.

411
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:04,970
They are all paupers, brother-in-law.

412
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:07,550
Killing them won't cover for our losses.

413
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,510
Let's hire them for the other job.

414
00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:16,470
Yes. They are worth dying.

415
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,220
Let them die their own death.

416
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:24,010
Congratulations. 
From today you're our servants.

417
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:25,420
- Sir! 
- Thank you, sir.

418
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:26,720
What is it?

419
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,220
Will we look good as servants?

420
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,050
We won't look good as beggars either.

421
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:35,680
But, if we stay around you any longer 
you'll reduce us to beggars.

422
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:39,340
If we stay with him, 
we'll have no arms to beg either.

423
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:41,590
Like this. I am gonna slap you.

424
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,260
Boys, take them to servant's quarters.

425
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,300
Nothing happens when you do 
something like this.

426
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:49,880
What is he doing here?

427
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,130
He's the family priest.

428
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:52,510
He comes here every day.

429
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:53,720
- Come on. 
- Okay.

430
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,550
But this doesn't look like a temple.

431
00:24:58,260 --> 00:24:59,920
It was our first day on the job.

432
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,970
- How he came here? 
- What is this?

433
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:06,840
What is bad luck, tragedy, and 
adversity doing in your home, Raja sir?

434
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,510
Working for us.

435
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:10,630
WiFi's punished them.

436
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,260
He gave them jobs as a punishment?

437
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:14,880
Yes... 
Sentenced-to-work.

438
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:17,510
WiFi, you don't know them.

439
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:20,970
People quit the city these guys live in.

440
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:22,340
And you're letting them 
stay in your home.

441
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:24,090
They cost us 70 million rupees.

442
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:25,550
If you let them stay here...

443
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:29,470
...those 70 million will turn 
into a much bigger number.

444
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:32,470
They are like an app of bad luck...

445
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:35,780
...once downloaded on your system, 
can never be deleted.

446
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:38,590
Look, man, I don't believe in you. 
Brother-in-law does...

447
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:40,420
But this time even he's 
not going to listen to you.

448
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:42,510
Because this time it 
wasn't just about our money...

449
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:44,470
...but also our reputation 
that was ruined.

450
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:46,050
- Raja sir... 
- Look here...

451
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:48,420
In order to keep my influence...

452
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:53,840
...I got shot in my leg 6 times 
but didn't change my decision.

453
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,760
Let's go, brother-in-law.

454
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,010
- Hey, take care of him. 
- Okay, sir.

455
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:03,550
Oh sh**

456
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:05,300
What a house.

457
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:07,420
- Wow... 
- The dining room's that way.

458
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:10,810
Layout the plates, we're coming. 
Just kidding, buddy.

459
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:13,050
Come. Sit. Eat.

460
00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:15,260
Stop joking with us.

461
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:17,260
Not at all, sir. 
Please, help yourself.

462
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:19,420
- Help ourselves? 
- Come, come.

463
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:28,260
Go ahead and eat.

464
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:29,840
This is your job.

465
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:32,590
Thank you.

466
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:34,260
Take that.

467
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:36,510
What is it?

468
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:40,470
I've never seen such variety 
even at any of our family weddings.

469
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:41,230
Yeah.

470
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:44,130
- Even if they recover the losses... 
- Yes.

471
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:45,720
- ...we'll damage something else. 
- Right.

472
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,170
- But we'll never quit this job. 
- Yeah.

473
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:51,840
Isn't the plate too small?

474
00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:53,380
You just have to taste the food.

475
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:55,680
You reminded me of my mother.

476
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:59,300
She used to say, taste everything 
and take more of whatever you like.

477
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:01,340
You're so sweet.

478
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:07,590
Who are those guys?

479
00:27:07,670 --> 00:27:09,010
They are your seniors.

480
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:11,420
They used to taste 
the food before you two.

481
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:13,920
I never heard of such a job before.

482
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:15,590
It's a weird job.

483
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:19,090
One second... 
Hold on...

484
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:20,340
Yeah...

485
00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:23,090
Thank you.

486
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:24,300
Why take our picture?

487
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:26,260
We might need to frame them.

488
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:27,990
Frame?

489
00:27:28,670 --> 00:27:31,090
Amazing. 
How are you guys?

490
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:32,970
All good?

491
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:35,630
Did you taste the food?

492
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:36,840
Yes. It's nice.

493
00:27:37,670 --> 00:27:39,760
Pass me the chicken salad. 
Looks nice.

494
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:41,970
That hasn't been tasted yet.

495
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:44,840
What were you waiting for?

496
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:47,110
John.

497
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,880
Wifi sir, what's going on?

498
00:27:52,050 --> 00:27:54,010
It's the price of being a don.

499
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:55,590
We have many enemies.

500
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:57,970
And especially Tulli and Bulli.

501
00:27:58,050 --> 00:28:00,300
They managed to get to our kitchen.

502
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:01,050
I see...

503
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:03,970
They want to poison 
our food and kill us.

504
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:05,510
Poison the food...

505
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:09,300
You mean these pictures...

506
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:11,550
Yeah, martyrs in the line of duty.

507
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:13,050
- Martyrs? 
- Yes.

508
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:16,920
You call such guys martyrs?

509
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:18,590
Yes, why?

510
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:21,470
We call it a terrible 
way to kick the bucket.

511
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:22,680
We won't eat this food.

512
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:35,880
And why is that?

513
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:39,010
It can be poisoned, sir.

514
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:40,380
So?

515
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:42,880
We can die, sir.

516
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:46,380
Whose life is more important?

517
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:48,340
Yours.

518
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:51,300
Then eat up.

519
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:55,340
Because we can't eat 
until you guys don't eat.

520
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:59,590
And I don't like to stay hungry.

521
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:06,170
I am fast...

522
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:09,220
- I mean I am fasting. 
- No...

523
00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:12,720
Help him, guys...

524
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:16,550
Help these two break their fast.

525
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:18,720
No, no, I am eating.

526
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,590
I'll eat.

527
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:22,720
See, I'm eating.

528
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,720
Mama...

529
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:26,760
Mama...

530
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,130
- What happened? 
- Chandu...

531
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:35,170
I ate poison, Chandu.

532
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:37,470
Chandu...

533
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:40,420
I am dying, Chandu. 
Look after yourself.

534
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:42,880
Don't eat this. It's poisoned.

535
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:44,340
It's too bitter.

536
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:46,220
Its bitter gourd.

537
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:47,090
Bitter gourd!

538
00:29:47,170 --> 00:29:49,550
- Its bitter gourd. 
- Yes.

539
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:51,630
- Its bitter gourd. 
- Its bitter gourd.

540
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,590
Its bitter gourd.

541
00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:53,840
Bitter gourd aged us.

542
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:08,090
These brothers-in-law are so strange.

543
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:10,130
Sometimes they are like villains, 
sometimes like a hero.

544
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:11,630
They are travelling 
in a servant's car...

545
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,760
...and the servant's 
travelling in their car.

546
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:18,630
Because it's always the 
boss' car that's attacked.

547
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:22,130
Attack?

548
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:27,300
A few days ago, my brother 
was sitting where I am sitting now.

549
00:30:28,050 --> 00:30:31,510
And another guy was sitting 
where you're sitting.

550
00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:37,470
Their arch enemies Tulli and 
Bulli blew up the car to kill them...

551
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:41,590
...and my brother and the 
other guy died in the attack.

552
00:30:41,670 --> 00:30:44,380
Meaning they dressed me 
up and made me sit in the car...

553
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:46,170
..so I can die instead of them.

554
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:47,170
Stop the car.

555
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:50,260
Sir, the guards are right behind us...

556
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:51,920
...and they will shoot you.

557
00:30:52,010 --> 00:30:53,590
Please, remove it...

558
00:30:56,170 --> 00:30:57,670
Do they get attacked every day?

559
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:00,050
No. Only on some days.

560
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:02,170
But this someday can be any day, right?

561
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:06,590
We're on a journey of death...

562
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:07,970
Aren't you scared?

563
00:31:08,050 --> 00:31:10,130
Strong words from a weak stomach.

564
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:13,760
If poor people are scared, 
then how will they survive.

565
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,510
Then why don't you run away?

566
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:18,800
Are you showing concern for me, 
or thinking of an idea for yourself.

567
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:19,850
Both.

568
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:23,220
These scavengers have a keen eye-sight.

569
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:28,510
They can find what even Google can't.

570
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:25,500
I told brother-in-law...

571
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:27,010
...to buy a few bullet-proof jackets.

572
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,860
Is there anyone?

573
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,260
Help me!

574
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:33,020
Help!

575
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:48,060
Where do you think you're going?

576
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,190
Stop!

577
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:51,680
I will kill you.

578
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,440
Brother-in-law, are you okay?

579
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:56,650
Where do you disappear 
to when I need you?

580
00:32:56,730 --> 00:32:58,350
I went for my gun.

581
00:32:58,430 --> 00:32:59,900
But he locked the dashboard...

582
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:02,730
...and put the key 
in your car's keychain.

583
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:05,080
We must do something 
about Tulli and Bulli.

584
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:08,870
Their gang's increasing 
faster than pigs lay piglets.

585
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:10,510
Don't worry, brother-in-law.

586
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:12,690
Until I don't curb his numbers...

587
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:17,120
...we have this gung-ho, to act as bait.

588
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:19,140
Come on, let's go.

589
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:23,070
"I think all the troubles 
in the world come after me."

590
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:29,470
- Headphones. 
- Are they going to play music?

591
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,560
No. This is the latest 
translation device.

592
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:34,520
This way you can understand what they 
are saying and they will understand us.

593
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:35,890
- Yeah, I got it. 
- Wear it.

594
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:37,680
Yes, sir.

595
00:33:37,810 --> 00:33:41,100
Are you a partner only in profits, 
and not in loss?

596
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,470
Both sir.

597
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:43,970
But there was no profit.

598
00:33:44,370 --> 00:33:45,720
And we're in no position 
to pay for the losses.

599
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:49,180
Recover the losses from those bas***

600
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:51,180
Mind your language.

601
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:52,350
I am sorry.

602
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:56,430
I meant...make those 
decent guys pay for the loss.

603
00:33:56,590 --> 00:34:01,100
Yes, ...we sold the movers and 
packers office and all its belongings...

604
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:03,350
...thinking that something's 
better than nothing.

605
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:06,720
What was that...

606
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:08,140
It's an old Indian saying...

607
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:10,520
We meant...whatever 
we could get our hands-on.

608
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,210
Whatever..

609
00:34:12,470 --> 00:34:14,020
Where are your partners?

610
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:18,010
If only I knew, 
I would've murdered those rascals.

611
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:22,240
Are you a professional killer?

612
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,480
No, no...

613
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:26,010
We Indians often speak 
like this when we're angry.

614
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:27,930
- Yes... 
- Emotional people.

615
00:34:28,410 --> 00:34:30,930
This is a serious case of cheating.

616
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:33,520
I'll have to send you both to jail.

617
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,480
Hold on, sir.

618
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:38,850
We'll send our home, office, 
and properties to pay for the damages.

619
00:34:38,930 --> 00:34:39,890
- Yes. 
- Isn't it, uncle?

620
00:34:39,970 --> 00:34:41,060
Yes...

621
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:45,810
I also know a very old saying 
that is very popular in India.

622
00:34:45,890 --> 00:34:48,810
Greed is never good.

623
00:34:50,850 --> 00:34:54,290
- Your request is granted. 
- Thank you.

624
00:34:54,370 --> 00:34:58,460
But until that time you 
will be in Police custody.

625
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:00,260
Police custody...

626
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:01,510
Next.

627
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:04,060
Uncle. Uncle.

628
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:05,350
Be careful.

629
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:07,600
Sir, we're senior citizens.

630
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,430
Our children owned the fireworks shop.

631
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:13,060
It's their fault that the 
entire market was reduced to ashes.

632
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:15,640
The entire market?

633
00:35:16,530 --> 00:35:18,510
Lunch is ready.

634
00:35:20,810 --> 00:35:22,640
What are you guys waiting for? 
Hurry up and taste the food.

635
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,860
The bosses are hungry.

636
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:30,760
Raj... WiFi sir is leaving. 
Let's go.

637
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:42,510
We three set out on this 
life journey together...

638
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:45,480
...but I am the only one 
basking in luxury and comfort.

639
00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:47,640
That WiFi gave me a great job.

640
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:50,180
Travel, have fun.

641
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,680
It's a beautiful city.

642
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:54,850
Yes.

643
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:57,470
But whenever I look 
at the beautiful valleys...

644
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,470
...its you two I think of, 
and not Sanjana.

645
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,850
- Are you serious? 
- Yes.

646
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:03,970
I pulled down the window and yelled...

647
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,120
Junky! Chandu!

648
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:10,680
- And do you know what I heard? 
- What?

649
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:12,550
Why didn't you bring them along?

650
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:15,670
Why didn't you bring them along?

651
00:36:18,930 --> 00:36:21,100
Even we have a great job.

652
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,560
Really great.

653
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:26,270
You're the foodie but 
we get to enjoy a feast.

654
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:29,310
You love sweets...and we're dying.

655
00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:31,180
I mean sweets...

656
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:34,470
The job and food are so 
great that people are dying...

657
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,720
Don't talk about food.

658
00:36:36,810 --> 00:36:38,260
I can't control myself.

659
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:40,060
Control, brother. Control.

660
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:42,470
- He called us to eat. Come. 
- Let's go.

661
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,260
-No, no... 
- What happened?

662
00:36:44,730 --> 00:36:45,970
Let's exchange jobs.

663
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:49,620
Don't be crazy. Who would 
like to exchange such a great job?

664
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:51,980
One has to make an 
exception for friends.

665
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:53,560
Don't be stubborn. 
Give him.

666
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,460
Only for you... 
Just for you...

667
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:58,260
- Sacrifice. 
- Okay...

668
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:01,100
I'll go eat inside, 
while you guys get some fresh air.

669
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:02,580
But will these guys agree?

670
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,280
All they care about 
is getting the job done...

671
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,260
...whether it's you two or me.

672
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:06,220
Yeah, he's right.

673
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:07,390
I heard that the 
brothers-in-law are so tight...

674
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:08,720
...that they even 
exchange their underwear.

675
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:11,100
- So what if we change jobs. 
- Correct.

676
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:13,350
- Have fun. 
- Have fun.

677
00:37:14,390 --> 00:37:17,190
"Cuckoo..."

678
00:37:18,050 --> 00:37:19,790
Badluck!

679
00:37:20,790 --> 00:37:21,850
Pass it. Pass it. Pass it.

680
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:26,140
Such bad luck. Oh, God!

681
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:28,810
Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad.

682
00:37:28,890 --> 00:37:32,560
Why do things that you've 
to be embarrassed of?

683
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:49,900
He's useless, and this one's a jalopy.

684
00:38:08,390 --> 00:38:09,460
Oh, mother...

685
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:11,480
Oh, mother...

686
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:14,070
Who is the new patient?

687
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:15,980
It's me you idiots.

688
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:17,900
Food poisoning.

689
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:20,610
If I wasn't rushed 
to the hospital on time...

690
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:23,360
...then you two would 
be attending my funeral.

691
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,610
And if we had reached the car...

692
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:28,940
...then we wouldn't even get a funeral.

693
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:32,730
You two always end up 
with bad luck because of me.

694
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:37,400
If only our business had succeeded, 
then we would all have been successful.

695
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:41,650
Plus Sanjana and Uncle were jailed.

696
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:42,850
What?

697
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:49,190
- Don't cry. 
- Why shouldn't I cry?

698
00:38:49,650 --> 00:38:51,520
Uncle and aunty are in jail as well.

699
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:52,820
Uncle?

700
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,610
Aunty?

701
00:38:54,690 --> 00:38:56,690
Your dad...and your mom.

702
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:58,690
My dad's in jail.

703
00:38:58,770 --> 00:39:00,940
My mom's in jail.

704
00:39:01,730 --> 00:39:03,690
- Stay there, I am coming. 
- Come on.

705
00:39:03,770 --> 00:39:04,980
- Give me a hand. 
- Here.

706
00:39:05,070 --> 00:39:06,610
- Go on. 
- Thanks.

707
00:39:06,690 --> 00:39:08,190
Go on.

708
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:10,110
Give me a hand.

709
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:12,000
- Don't spare him. 
- What are you going to do?

710
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:14,440
- Kill him. 
- Leave me.

711
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,020
How did this happen, Chandu?

712
00:39:29,730 --> 00:39:31,320
There was a bomb under the car.

713
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,690
Who keeps a bomb on the car's seat.

714
00:39:35,270 --> 00:39:36,730
The entire car blew up.

715
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:39,110
Thank God you didn't blow up too.

716
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:41,650
You should have checked 
before getting in.

717
00:39:41,730 --> 00:39:43,230
We didn't get in...

718
00:39:43,410 --> 00:39:45,150
Before that...

719
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:47,940
I'll tell papa to 
get you a metal detector.

720
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:49,070
Thanks.

721
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:52,570
Blasts are pretty common with us.

722
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:55,360
Don't worry. 
I brought food for you.

723
00:39:55,690 --> 00:39:57,650
Thank you. No...

724
00:39:58,520 --> 00:39:59,820
It can be poisoned.

725
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:02,190
I checked it myself.

726
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:05,220
Silly.

727
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:07,570
What?

728
00:40:07,650 --> 00:40:10,020
No, I meant it lovingly.

729
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,820
Silly.

730
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,980
- Get well soon, okay. 
- You too...

731
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:17,480
- Bye. 
- Bye.

732
00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:26,590
Bouquet for you and 
not even a stare for us.

733
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:29,110
What do you guys think? 
Does she really love me?

734
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:30,110
Of course...

735
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:32,610
What have I got that you two don't?

736
00:40:32,690 --> 00:40:35,400
Girl's go crazy about me.

737
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:38,270
But...she is a little crazy.

738
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:41,690
You're not exactly a scientist either.

739
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:43,360
You're a little crazy too.

740
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,440
- That's right. 
- Then everything's in place.

741
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,110
- She's crazy and you're mad. 
- Right.

742
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:49,980
She's giving you the red signal, 
just go forward.

743
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:52,780
- Correct. 
- Once she says yes...

744
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:55,070
- ..then the brothers-in-law will have 
to get you two married.

745
00:40:55,150 --> 00:40:56,250
- Really? 
- Yes.

746
00:40:58,370 --> 00:41:00,270
Can you hear? 
Trumpets?

747
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:02,360
Yeah, I can hear it.

748
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,480
I can't hear it.

749
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:05,170
Music's in the air.

750
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:06,190
You will be groom.

751
00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:07,550
Janvi will be the bride.

752
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:08,700
Wow...

753
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:14,110
Brother WiFi, 
why are we all looking so different?

754
00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:16,270
Because this is a destination wedding, 
my prince.

755
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:17,480
Destination.

756
00:41:17,570 --> 00:41:19,760
And in the Middle East.

757
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:29,230
[arabic language]

758
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:37,860
[arabic language]

759
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:53,150
"Face like an Irani.

760
00:41:53,230 --> 00:41:55,520
"Sways like an Afghani."

761
00:41:55,610 --> 00:41:57,820
"Eyes so mischievous."

762
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:00,110
"Tresses that are carefree."

763
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:02,570
"Moves like a storm."

764
00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:04,860
"Attitude like royalty."

765
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:07,320
"Enthralling beauty."

766
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,770
"Drop dead gorgeous."

767
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:14,690
"You're a true nonchalant."

768
00:42:14,770 --> 00:42:19,320
"Rumours about you have gone rife."

769
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,730
"Mind-blowing..."

770
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:23,860
"Marvellous..."

771
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:26,190
"Desert Rose..."

772
00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:28,690
"Mind-blowing..."

773
00:42:28,770 --> 00:42:31,110
"Mind-blowing..."

774
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:33,610
"Marvellous..."

775
00:42:33,730 --> 00:42:35,900
"Desert Rose..."

776
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:38,440
"Mind-blowing..."

777
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:47,940
[arabic language]

778
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:57,230
"Killer style..."

779
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:59,570
"Piercing eyes."

780
00:42:59,650 --> 00:43:04,520
"Don't kill your poor fanatics."

781
00:43:04,610 --> 00:43:06,610
"You're out of this world..."

782
00:43:06,690 --> 00:43:09,150
"...attitude like a queen."

783
00:43:09,230 --> 00:43:13,980
"Your beauty will make 
my heart skip a beat."

784
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:16,110
"I am an intoxication..."

785
00:43:16,190 --> 00:43:18,650
"I am the elixir..."

786
00:43:18,730 --> 00:43:23,460
"Come and taste this..."

787
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:27,360
"Your name's always on my lips."

788
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:29,780
"You're in all my mentions."

789
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:32,650
"You dwell in my heart."

790
00:43:32,730 --> 00:43:34,940
"You're intoxicating..."

791
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:37,360
"You are an elixir..."

792
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:41,980
"There's no harm in tasting you once."

793
00:43:42,070 --> 00:43:46,650
"My heart's sunk in your love."

794
00:43:46,730 --> 00:43:51,020
"You stole my heart..."

795
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:55,690
"I am happy you concern on me"

796
00:43:55,770 --> 00:43:57,730
"Mind-blowing..."

797
00:43:57,820 --> 00:44:00,070
"Marvellous..."

798
00:44:00,610 --> 00:44:02,650
"Desert Rose..."

799
00:44:02,970 --> 00:44:04,860
"Mind-blowing..."

800
00:44:05,250 --> 00:44:07,480
"Mind-blowing..."

801
00:44:07,570 --> 00:44:09,860
"Marvellous..."

802
00:44:10,050 --> 00:44:12,270
"Desert Rose..."

803
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:14,520
"Mind-blowing..."

804
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:26,770
Goodbye.

805
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:31,400
Someone wrote a love 
letter to my daughter today.

806
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:34,070
Who is that Romeo?

807
00:44:36,390 --> 00:44:38,260
Read the letter.

808
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:39,720
Sweety.

809
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:42,140
The first time we met...

810
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:44,550
Together we fell and 
even got up together...

811
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:47,680
...that's when I had 
already sunk in your eyes.

812
00:44:47,930 --> 00:44:52,550
Now you decide whether I stay 
sunken in these eyes or swim out.

813
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:55,050
Just say that you love me.

814
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:58,140
And yes, don't be scared of your...

815
00:44:58,930 --> 00:45:01,470
- ...crippled father and scoundrel uncle. 
- Enough.

816
00:45:01,550 --> 00:45:03,140
No need to read any further.

817
00:45:07,390 --> 00:45:10,550
Whoever wrote this hate-love letter, 
better man up now.

818
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:15,840
We literally raised Janvi. 
She is like my child.

819
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:19,510
And you?

820
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:22,680
Strong words from a weak stomach. 
She is our little child.

821
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:30,300
You all know that Wifi's 
eyes are like binoculars.

822
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:33,760
I can tell you...

823
00:45:33,930 --> 00:45:36,720
...how much wood did 
the woodchuck chuck...

824
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:39,760
...if the woodchuck chucked wood.

825
00:45:40,590 --> 00:45:43,680
Just for your information. 
Chandu doesn't chuck wood.

826
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:46,390
And he's never been near any wood.

827
00:45:46,890 --> 00:45:47,760
Haven't you?

828
00:45:48,970 --> 00:45:50,390
- No. He didn't go. 
- No.

829
00:45:50,890 --> 00:45:52,680
Chandu...

830
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:57,270
If Wifi happens to use his methods...

831
00:45:57,350 --> 00:45:59,300
- ...you will repent. 
- Stop staring at me, rascals.

832
00:45:59,390 --> 00:46:00,760
You guys told me to do it.

833
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:02,800
We told you to tell her.

834
00:46:03,090 --> 00:46:04,550
Why did you write a love letter?

835
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:05,840
Now they have evidence.

836
00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:09,060
In the age of emails and whatsapp who 
the bloody hell writes a love letter?

837
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:14,720
May I?

838
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:19,890
- Nice writing, isn't it? 
- Yes.

839
00:46:20,550 --> 00:46:21,340
This belongs to Chandu.

840
00:46:22,390 --> 00:46:24,590
How dare you write latter to our child?

841
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:25,840
Aren't you ashamed?

842
00:46:25,930 --> 00:46:26,890
- How dare you write a love letter. 
- Stop.

843
00:46:26,970 --> 00:46:29,360
How dare you betray your own master.

844
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:31,890
Stop! Stop. Stop.

845
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:35,180
Wifi sir, this is not a love letter...

846
00:46:36,140 --> 00:46:37,470
...this is a scene from the play.

847
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:38,640
What?

848
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:40,220
And he's not some Romeo.

849
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:42,260
This poor guy's a writer and actor.

850
00:46:42,930 --> 00:46:44,840
Is Janvi madam's name written on this?

851
00:46:45,650 --> 00:46:47,300
All the dialogues are in Hindi...

852
00:46:47,390 --> 00:46:49,800
...why did you make 
these Brits stand in line?

853
00:46:50,050 --> 00:46:50,930
Okay...

854
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:54,720
Is the father in your 
play cripple as well?

855
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:58,050
Raja sir, don't give 
yourself so much importance.

856
00:46:58,340 --> 00:47:00,340
You're not the only crippled 
person in this world.

857
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:02,590
There can be other father's 
in this world who are crippled.

858
00:47:06,510 --> 00:47:08,680
And the uncle's a scoundrel. Right?

859
00:47:09,220 --> 00:47:10,640
Uncle's are always a scoundrel.

860
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:11,840
Take Kans for instance.

861
00:47:12,930 --> 00:47:15,840
And what's Sweety?

862
00:47:16,510 --> 00:47:17,910
That's the heroine's name?

863
00:47:18,090 --> 00:47:21,800
Then what will you call my daughter?

864
00:47:22,910 --> 00:47:23,680
Sister...

865
00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:28,180
Janvi madam is like my sister, Raja sir.

866
00:47:28,430 --> 00:47:30,220
In fact, she is my sister.

867
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:31,590
Isn't that right, sister?

868
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:32,590
Did you call me sister?

869
00:47:32,930 --> 00:47:33,840
Sister?

870
00:47:35,930 --> 00:47:37,470
He deserved that.

871
00:47:38,550 --> 00:47:39,430
Janvi.

872
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:40,890
Dear!

873
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:43,720
I got slapped even 
after calling her sister.

874
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:46,140
Bloody nincompoop...

875
00:47:46,510 --> 00:47:48,800
From which angle does 
my niece look like your sister.

876
00:47:49,510 --> 00:47:52,760
If you call a good looking girl sister 
then won't she cry?

877
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:54,540
Isn't this domestic violence?

878
00:47:56,550 --> 00:48:02,300
- 2nd slap! 
- You'll always be an actor and writer.

879
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:04,970
You can never become a director.

880
00:48:05,050 --> 00:48:08,150
You don't have an eye for it. 
Rascal!

881
00:48:08,230 --> 00:48:08,760
3rd slap!

882
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:10,930
Come on, get back to your work.

883
00:48:11,010 --> 00:48:12,340
Get to work.

884
00:48:12,430 --> 00:48:14,050
- WiFi.. 
- Brother-in-law.

885
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:17,590
I weaved so many dreams in a single day.

886
00:48:18,260 --> 00:48:23,390
I thought that there's a guy who 
can write a love letter to our daughter.

887
00:48:24,190 --> 00:48:26,550
If this was a love letter...

888
00:48:26,630 --> 00:48:28,720
...and if he hadn't called her sister...

889
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:31,180
...then I would've gotten 
him married to Janvi...

890
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:33,730
...and given him all my property.

891
00:48:37,330 --> 00:48:38,680
Is she your sister?

892
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:40,300
How dare you call her your sister?

893
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:42,930
Such a huge mistake! 
Such a huge mistake!

894
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:49,680
Darling.

895
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:53,590
Darling?

896
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:55,670
And what did you call me back then? 
Sister.

897
00:48:55,940 --> 00:48:57,800
I had to say it.

898
00:48:57,890 --> 00:48:59,640
Those guys you know...guns...

899
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:01,140
- Rascal. 
- Cheapster.

900
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:04,350
You know, when you called me sister...

901
00:49:04,430 --> 00:49:07,090
...it sounded like an insult to me.

902
00:49:09,090 --> 00:49:14,330
Believe me, if you were born 
in Haridwar instead of London...

903
00:49:14,410 --> 00:49:18,720
...I would've never called you sister.

904
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:19,800
Jaan.

905
00:49:20,930 --> 00:49:22,590
What do I call you?

906
00:49:22,890 --> 00:49:24,470
Chand?

907
00:49:25,510 --> 00:49:26,430
Jaan.

908
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:28,090
Chand?

909
00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:28,970
Jaan.

910
00:49:29,090 --> 00:49:29,680
Chand?

911
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:30,550
Jaan.

912
00:49:35,470 --> 00:49:37,430
You're such a rascal and a lowlife.

913
00:49:39,590 --> 00:49:42,170
First, you called her your sister, 
and now you're flirting with her.

914
00:49:43,470 --> 00:49:46,640
I just called her sister, 
but I didn't mean any of it.

915
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,010
Unbelievable guys.

916
00:49:49,090 --> 00:49:52,180
Even Gujaratis address 
their wife as "Ben" (Sister)!

917
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:54,170
Kamla Ben, Vimla Ben, Kanta Ben.

918
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:56,040
Does that make them siblings?

919
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:59,640
On that logic, once more...

920
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:03,760
"Your beloved sister's 
will make a beautiful bride..."

921
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:05,220
Who is singing out there?

922
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:06,800
- It's him. 
- It's him.

923
00:50:07,180 --> 00:50:09,470
- Escape. 
- This way.

924
00:50:41,430 --> 00:50:45,720
Salutations...from Baba Jani 
to my near and dear ones.

925
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:46,410
Salutations.

926
00:50:46,490 --> 00:50:50,890
May the Lord of this universe, 
bless you with good health.

927
00:50:51,450 --> 00:50:57,140
And yes...also with maturity, 
to turn this enmity into friendship.

928
00:50:57,840 --> 00:50:59,340
Friendship with these people.

929
00:50:59,630 --> 00:51:01,840
That's not possible in this lifetime.

930
00:51:02,430 --> 00:51:04,510
- Right Bulli bro? 
- Yes, Tulli bro.

931
00:51:04,890 --> 00:51:07,760
They poisoned our father to death.

932
00:51:08,090 --> 00:51:09,980
Don't forget that you 
killed our father first.

933
00:51:10,190 --> 00:51:14,890
You shot me six times in the 
same leg and made me a cripple for life.

934
00:51:14,970 --> 00:51:18,390
You ruined our extortion business.

935
00:51:18,590 --> 00:51:20,180
Who started all this?

936
00:51:20,470 --> 00:51:22,990
Who turned our weapons against us?

937
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:26,340
Who forcefully took over our casinos?

938
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:28,180
- He.. 
- Quiet!

939
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:31,930
I didn't call you two here 
to reminisce your flashback.

940
00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:34,680
I called you here for a settlement.

941
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:37,300
Because my money is 
riding on both of you.

942
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:42,050
And any more loss is intolerable.

943
00:51:43,390 --> 00:51:44,800
Even to the one on top.

944
00:51:47,890 --> 00:51:50,760
Everyone in the Underworld 
knows that you're on the top.

945
00:51:51,130 --> 00:51:52,050
Right Bulli bro?

946
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:53,550
Yes, Tulli bro.

947
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:57,140
All the guys in this 
world who are on the top...

948
00:51:57,220 --> 00:51:58,890
...have someone who's on top of them.

949
00:51:58,970 --> 00:52:00,890
But this guy...

950
00:52:01,930 --> 00:52:03,830
...has no one else on top of him.

951
00:52:06,570 --> 00:52:10,430
What you, me, they earn in a year...

952
00:52:11,090 --> 00:52:13,470
...is like peanuts to him.

953
00:52:15,370 --> 00:52:19,220
Today you'll meet a magician...

954
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:23,760
...whose making billions without 
shedding a single drop of blood.

955
00:52:26,140 --> 00:52:28,510
Welcome, Niraj Modi sir. 
Welcome.

956
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:34,390
How are you?

957
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:36,470
All well, guys.

958
00:52:38,660 --> 00:52:41,300
I heard... 
I heard about you guys.

959
00:52:41,860 --> 00:52:42,800
You guys are useful.

960
00:52:43,340 --> 00:52:46,090
Look, money can fuel enmity...

961
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:48,640
...but enmity is 
never good for business.

962
00:52:51,180 --> 00:52:53,090
Do you know what my 
papa's favourite song was?

963
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:53,900
No.

964
00:52:54,550 --> 00:52:55,800
"Lend a hand, O companion."

965
00:52:55,890 --> 00:52:58,680
"Alone you'll get tired 
let's count the money together."

966
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:01,720
- Understood? 
- We did... We did...

967
00:53:01,890 --> 00:53:03,720
I haven't finished yet. 
How could you understand?

968
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:08,090
I've had enough of you two.

969
00:53:08,390 --> 00:53:10,470
Now shake hands. Embrace...

970
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:12,470
Kiss and make up.

971
00:53:12,550 --> 00:53:13,840
We've already made up.

972
00:53:15,220 --> 00:53:16,510
Raja bro...

973
00:53:16,590 --> 00:53:18,090
Brother. Brother.

974
00:53:20,220 --> 00:53:23,010
Baba, don't they know how to hug?

975
00:53:24,210 --> 00:53:24,970
Why not..

976
00:53:25,050 --> 00:53:26,430
WiFi...

977
00:53:26,510 --> 00:53:28,220
Stay back... keep a distance...

978
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:30,590
Is it loaded?

979
00:53:32,390 --> 00:53:35,010
WiFi...keep your cool.

980
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:37,760
You see if let the temperature soar, 
and there's hay...

981
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:39,280
...then there's a bright 
chance of catching fire.

982
00:53:42,530 --> 00:53:43,370
Let me tell you a story.

983
00:53:43,450 --> 00:53:45,190
When I was still in my mother's womb...

984
00:53:45,270 --> 00:53:47,350
...she accidentally swallowed a penny.

985
00:53:48,140 --> 00:53:50,260
I was born with the 
penny clutched in my fist.

986
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:53,760
The doctors and nurses 
tried very hard...

987
00:53:54,170 --> 00:53:55,220
...but they couldn't unclench my fist.

988
00:53:55,300 --> 00:53:57,760
Then my father showed me a dollar coin.

989
00:53:58,620 --> 00:54:00,640
I let go of the penny 
and took the dollar.

990
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:01,470
Understand?

991
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:04,020
I have a born connection with money.

992
00:54:04,220 --> 00:54:04,840
Yes.

993
00:54:05,070 --> 00:54:08,590
I only unclench my 
fist when I see more money.

994
00:54:09,470 --> 00:54:11,300
So I've unclenched my fist for you guys.

995
00:54:11,510 --> 00:54:12,930
Take as much as you want.

996
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:15,510
Double-triple-quadruple the amount.

997
00:54:16,220 --> 00:54:17,730
But no loss.

998
00:54:19,550 --> 00:54:21,970
Well...see you then. 
Goodbye.

999
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:39,090
- WiFi... 
- Yes.

1000
00:54:39,550 --> 00:54:41,270
Niraj's sent us 75 billion.

1001
00:54:41,490 --> 00:54:43,260
That's fine, brother-in-law.

1002
00:54:43,650 --> 00:54:48,510
But what hurts is that Tulli 
and Bulli got the same amount.

1003
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:50,390
They must be having a ball.

1004
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:05,550
Take a look.

1005
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:07,640
It wasn't the right thing to do...

1006
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:10,640
...by softening us up 
in the name of the settlement.

1007
00:55:10,970 --> 00:55:11,970
Yes.

1008
00:55:13,230 --> 00:55:14,260
As the saying goes...

1009
00:55:15,350 --> 00:55:20,050
In the Underworld, one should keep 
shaking his leg even when fast asleep.

1010
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:24,550
Otherwise, our own people 
mistake us for dead and bury us.

1011
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:31,510
Don't shake so hard that you die.

1012
00:55:31,590 --> 00:55:32,890
- Sir... 
- Sir...

1013
00:55:33,010 --> 00:55:33,840
Sir...

1014
00:55:34,220 --> 00:55:36,390
You should pat us on the back.

1015
00:55:36,470 --> 00:55:37,050
Yes...

1016
00:55:37,140 --> 00:55:38,390
What did you do?

1017
00:55:38,470 --> 00:55:40,090
No, sir, first you 
must pat us on the back.

1018
00:55:40,180 --> 00:55:42,840
Bravo. Bravo.

1019
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:43,970
Now tell me.

1020
00:55:44,050 --> 00:55:48,590
You know that Tulli... 
We cleaned his brother Bulli's clock.

1021
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:52,560
- Bomb in the car... 
- Poison in the food.

1022
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:02,590
Bulli is now out of your lives.

1023
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,470
We made your enemy pay 
so dearly for this enmity...

1024
00:56:13,550 --> 00:56:18,260
...that even his enemies will forget 
their enmity and take pity on him.

1025
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:19,510
Wow...

1026
00:56:19,590 --> 00:56:20,930
- Wow... 
- How did you say that?

1027
00:56:21,010 --> 00:56:23,710
- Where did you learn it? 
- And it was rhyming.

1028
00:56:23,790 --> 00:56:25,430
I don't know. 
It just comes to me automatically.

1029
00:56:25,510 --> 00:56:27,510
Quiet. Quiet.

1030
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:32,390
Who told you to mix blood in the water?

1031
00:56:33,340 --> 00:56:35,180
- Did I tell you? 
- No...

1032
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:36,890
Did I?

1033
00:56:36,970 --> 00:56:40,470
Servants carrying out masters 
orders is a very old method.

1034
00:56:41,140 --> 00:56:43,640
That's more like a formality than duty.

1035
00:56:44,090 --> 00:56:47,970
And there is no formality 
between you and us.

1036
00:56:49,610 --> 00:56:53,220
A real servant is someone who 
understands his master's troubles.

1037
00:56:53,590 --> 00:56:57,120
And it should make their blood boil.

1038
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:59,560
- And our blood boiled. 
- Yes.

1039
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:01,590
Your blood boiled.

1040
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:02,720
Yes...

1041
00:57:02,990 --> 00:57:06,400
Do you have any clue that you've...

1042
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:11,660
...put us on the edge with your actions?

1043
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:17,310
We had buried the hatchet...

1044
00:57:17,390 --> 00:57:20,050
...but you just started 
the war all over again.

1045
00:57:24,220 --> 00:57:25,640
You three idiots.

1046
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:28,090
They sent us 7.5 million rupees.

1047
00:57:28,180 --> 00:57:30,720
But now they'll send bullets, 
and bombs our way.

1048
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:33,260
They will turn us cripple.

1049
00:57:33,340 --> 00:57:37,920
Excuse me...we still don't 
understand what we've done.

1050
00:57:49,260 --> 00:57:50,890
What do I do?

1051
00:57:53,850 --> 00:57:56,010
Sir...strong words from a weak stomach.

1052
00:57:56,090 --> 00:57:57,760
Bang-bang-bang.

1053
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,440
Bang...

1054
00:58:03,010 --> 00:58:04,140
Oh no!

1055
00:58:07,090 --> 00:58:08,630
No, no!

1056
00:58:10,660 --> 00:58:12,170
No, no!

1057
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:17,430
No one's going to harm them.

1058
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:24,290
Mummy!

1059
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:29,050
These three did a good deed 
out of love and emotion, and you guys...

1060
00:58:29,900 --> 00:58:31,140
- Papa.. 
- Where she is going?

1061
00:58:31,220 --> 00:58:34,730
These three did what uncle's been 
thinking of doing, but couldn't do it.

1062
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:36,050
- And uncle. 
- Yes, dear.

1063
00:58:37,940 --> 00:58:39,640
Don't shoot. Don't shoot.

1064
00:58:39,730 --> 00:58:43,440
- If you accidentally bite your tongue, 
do you uproot your teeth? - No...

1065
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:45,230
No, no, no, we don't.

1066
00:58:45,940 --> 00:58:47,770
What a great line. 
Amazing.

1067
00:58:47,850 --> 00:58:49,200
Oh no! Let's go.

1068
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:52,030
Papa, no one's going 
to lay a finger on them.

1069
00:58:52,110 --> 00:58:54,160
- And especially him. 
- Thank you.

1070
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:55,640
- Get lost. 
- Sorry.

1071
00:58:55,730 --> 00:58:58,990
Him. No one will lay a finger on him 
or else I will shoot myself.

1072
00:58:59,070 --> 00:59:02,360
This sibling love...

1073
00:59:07,990 --> 00:59:10,450
Look what has sent Baba Jani.

1074
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:22,600
Dear...

1075
00:59:23,940 --> 00:59:27,640
Before I shoot these three...

1076
00:59:28,020 --> 00:59:33,310
...stand over their dead bodies, 
and get my picture taken.

1077
00:59:33,390 --> 00:59:35,850
Take them away from my sights.

1078
00:59:35,940 --> 00:59:37,890
Rascals!

1079
00:59:42,850 --> 00:59:46,140
- Brother-in-law. 
- Papa. Papa.

1080
00:59:46,230 --> 00:59:49,310
After lossing my sister, I will never be 
able to deal with your loss.

1081
00:59:49,390 --> 00:59:53,480
Don't leave your WiFi alone, 
brother-in-law.

1082
00:59:54,330 --> 00:59:57,060
- Papa! 
- Call the doctor.

1083
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:05,920
Where are you going?

1084
01:00:07,750 --> 01:00:09,230
You broke the glass.

1085
01:00:09,310 --> 01:00:10,880
You always enter wrong place.

1086
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:12,000
What are you looking at?

1087
01:00:12,420 --> 01:00:13,880
Breaking of glass is good luck,

1088
01:00:20,580 --> 01:00:21,950
Smells like something's burning.

1089
01:00:22,030 --> 01:00:24,170
Yes. Smells like wood.

1090
01:00:24,420 --> 01:00:26,190
No.

1091
01:00:26,270 --> 01:00:27,750
It's paper.

1092
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:30,160
- No, it's wood. 
- Take a look.

1093
01:00:32,710 --> 01:00:34,090
- See... 
- I told you its paper.

1094
01:00:34,730 --> 01:00:35,920
Got it.

1095
01:00:36,390 --> 01:00:38,900
It's burning. Come on!

1096
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:42,840
- Come on! 
- What I do?

1097
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:44,750
Put it in the dustbin.

1098
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:46,380
Very good. Good bye.

1099
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:48,070
The dustbin's on fire.

1100
01:00:48,150 --> 01:00:51,070
What you have done? 
Douse it. Douse it.

1101
01:00:51,150 --> 01:00:53,250
What are you doing? 
Douse it.

1102
01:00:53,340 --> 01:00:55,390
Stick your leg in and douse it.

1103
01:00:56,650 --> 01:00:58,170
Douse it.

1104
01:00:58,250 --> 01:00:59,730
My leg stuck.

1105
01:01:04,670 --> 01:01:05,800
Why is he dancing?

1106
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:06,690
I am burning.

1107
01:01:06,770 --> 01:01:08,490
Throw the dustbin.

1108
01:01:10,390 --> 01:01:11,450
Oh no!

1109
01:01:12,170 --> 01:01:14,240
Douse it. 
Take it down.

1110
01:01:14,660 --> 01:01:17,400
Pull. Take it down.

1111
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:18,540
Oh God!

1112
01:01:20,370 --> 01:01:23,580
- The other curtain's on fire too. 
- Come out.

1113
01:01:23,660 --> 01:01:26,540
Run! Come on!

1114
01:01:26,620 --> 01:01:28,170
Douse it.

1115
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:29,920
Run. Run.

1116
01:01:30,810 --> 01:01:32,360
Let's go.

1117
01:01:32,890 --> 01:01:33,700
Run!

1118
01:01:43,030 --> 01:01:45,880
Doctor the chandelier fell 
on Raja sir's head...

1119
01:01:46,950 --> 01:01:50,150
Fire. Fire. Fire.

1120
01:01:50,340 --> 01:01:51,130
Fire.

1121
01:01:51,210 --> 01:01:53,880
- Fire in the strong room. 
- Fire in the strong room.

1122
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:56,170
That's where the money is.

1123
01:01:57,150 --> 01:01:59,590
Daughter give me my stick.

1124
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:03,440
How did the strong room catch fire?

1125
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:05,940
- The fire was in the library. 
- Run. Run.

1126
01:02:06,020 --> 01:02:08,670
Fire. Fire. Put it out.

1127
01:02:08,750 --> 01:02:12,040
Water, water. Call the fire brigade.

1128
01:02:12,120 --> 01:02:13,750
Put it out.

1129
01:02:14,990 --> 01:02:16,570
I am going to handle it.

1130
01:02:25,090 --> 01:02:26,590
Move.

1131
01:02:28,430 --> 01:02:29,790
Brother-in-law!

1132
01:02:36,730 --> 01:02:41,140
All money burned.

1133
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:48,600
Shall we sleep?

1134
01:02:48,900 --> 01:02:50,480
Yes, but let's keep the light on.

1135
01:02:50,810 --> 01:02:53,770
They should know that we're 
with them in this tough time.

1136
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:55,440
- Come on. 
- Come.

1137
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:57,190
- Sad. 
- Poor.

1138
01:02:59,380 --> 01:03:00,940
Sir, there's some bad...

1139
01:03:01,290 --> 01:03:02,600
There is bad news.

1140
01:03:02,810 --> 01:03:04,150
I have to tell you.

1141
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:05,850
Don't tell me anything.

1142
01:03:06,850 --> 01:03:10,100
Because I've no strength 
or courage to hear anything.

1143
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:14,770
And anyway, everything's ruined.

1144
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:17,190
All of it, brother-in-law.

1145
01:03:18,940 --> 01:03:20,520
We're left with nothing.

1146
01:03:21,580 --> 01:03:24,730
Since we employed them 
on your recommendation...

1147
01:03:24,810 --> 01:03:27,150
...we've only been having bad luck.

1148
01:03:28,810 --> 01:03:30,020
Casinos closed down.

1149
01:03:30,100 --> 01:03:32,350
And everyone's winning a jackpot 
in the ones that are still open.

1150
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:34,730
Hear that. Hear that.

1151
01:03:35,310 --> 01:03:37,060
Plastic was banned.

1152
01:03:37,230 --> 01:03:39,100
We became enemies with Tulli Gang.

1153
01:03:39,190 --> 01:03:40,350
The fire broke out.

1154
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:41,980
Money turned to dust.

1155
01:03:42,270 --> 01:03:46,650
The chandelier fell...broke my head. 
And now I can't even get high.

1156
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:50,440
The priest's advice 
has always been right.

1157
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:54,650
I wonder why we were 
so stubborn this time?

1158
01:03:54,730 --> 01:03:55,980
Brother-in-law.

1159
01:03:56,710 --> 01:03:58,560
Something's definitely wrong.

1160
01:03:59,140 --> 01:04:01,060
The other day I was 
watching a cricket match.

1161
01:04:01,220 --> 01:04:04,310
Virat was batting at 99.

1162
01:04:05,230 --> 01:04:08,730
When Raj Kishore came in, Virat got out.

1163
01:04:09,310 --> 01:04:12,230
Don't take the name of that guy.

1164
01:04:12,310 --> 01:04:13,270
Raja sir...

1165
01:04:14,440 --> 01:04:18,100
- The tall guy... 
- The rascal...

1166
01:04:18,190 --> 01:04:19,520
Yes, that rascal.

1167
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:21,600
Don't mistake him for an ordinary guy.

1168
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:25,460
He made India lose 320 million rupees.

1169
01:04:25,540 --> 01:04:26,940
- What? 
- Yes.

1170
01:04:27,020 --> 01:04:31,150
Take my advice, 
consider him a bad omen and...

1171
01:04:31,230 --> 01:04:34,310
Throw him out. 
Throw those bad luck out.

1172
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:40,100
Big words from a weak stomach. 
Lucky's going to win today.

1173
01:04:40,190 --> 01:04:41,980
Yes, he'll give the others 
a run for their money.

1174
01:04:42,060 --> 01:04:44,980
These three bad luck are leaving today.

1175
01:04:45,060 --> 01:04:47,660
Your stars have refreshed.

1176
01:04:47,740 --> 01:04:53,690
I was thinking should I bet my 
money on my favourite horse Lucky today.

1177
01:04:53,770 --> 01:04:55,940
Bet all you have.

1178
01:04:56,310 --> 01:04:57,650
This is all I have.

1179
01:04:57,730 --> 01:04:59,270
That's enough.

1180
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:02,010
I checked Lucky's stars on your advice.

1181
01:05:02,090 --> 01:05:05,600
- I see... 
- Lucky's lucky time is just beginning.

1182
01:05:08,940 --> 01:05:10,190
You know, priest.

1183
01:05:10,370 --> 01:05:11,270
What?

1184
01:05:11,350 --> 01:05:13,440
Whenever I was ruined...

1185
01:05:14,190 --> 01:05:17,400
...I've sought refuge in gambling, 
like a mother.

1186
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:20,400
People say gambling favours no one.

1187
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:22,440
But I say it favours me.

1188
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:29,270
Hello.

1189
01:05:29,560 --> 01:05:31,920
Tulli and Bulli are out for your blood.

1190
01:05:32,730 --> 01:05:34,230
Don't go to the racecourse today...

1191
01:05:34,350 --> 01:05:36,350
...or you'll end up losing 
the race of your life.

1192
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:41,350
I spent a lifetime playing 
this bloody game, Baba.

1193
01:05:41,510 --> 01:05:43,730
You can tell them that...

1194
01:05:43,810 --> 01:05:48,060
...if they have the nerve of steels, 
then they can come and face me.

1195
01:05:48,150 --> 01:05:49,730
I damn care.

1196
01:05:51,060 --> 01:05:52,740
Papa, you won't go.

1197
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:57,600
Silly, I won't go like this.

1198
01:05:57,680 --> 01:06:00,480
I'll go like this. 
Now am I looking good?

1199
01:06:02,150 --> 01:06:05,770
If anything happens to you, then who'll 
give me a happy present on my birthday.

1200
01:06:05,850 --> 01:06:08,600
You won't go. For my sake.

1201
01:06:09,060 --> 01:06:14,600
Six bullets in one 
leg and daughter's love.

1202
01:06:15,060 --> 01:06:16,730
What do I do?

1203
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:24,230
I have an idea.

1204
01:06:24,440 --> 01:06:25,770
- You go instead. 
- I?

1205
01:06:25,940 --> 01:06:27,150
Absolutely right.

1206
01:06:27,230 --> 01:06:30,060
It's just about betting the money. 
WiFi can do that.

1207
01:06:30,370 --> 01:06:31,650
What WiFi?

1208
01:06:32,820 --> 01:06:35,560
Those guys think I am 
a bigger threat than him.

1209
01:06:36,390 --> 01:06:38,310
They might even spare his life...

1210
01:06:38,520 --> 01:06:42,480
...but they will shoot me in the head.

1211
01:06:43,020 --> 01:06:44,060
I won't go.

1212
01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:49,470
What did you think? 
I am going to say something like that.

1213
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:51,150
I am brave heart man.

1214
01:06:51,270 --> 01:06:53,480
You all know... 
Emperor...

1215
01:06:53,560 --> 01:06:54,520
I am the king...

1216
01:06:54,600 --> 01:06:57,440
I'll take a couple of guns with me.

1217
01:06:57,520 --> 01:06:58,940
Hey, get the car.

1218
01:06:59,230 --> 01:07:00,520
The car's ready, sir.

1219
01:07:01,940 --> 01:07:03,520
I see, car's ready.

1220
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:04,650
Strong words from a weak stomach.

1221
01:07:04,730 --> 01:07:06,270
We're waiting for you to get in.

1222
01:07:06,350 --> 01:07:10,060
Coming. Coming. 
Janvi, see me in the car.

1223
01:07:10,520 --> 01:07:13,020
- Who made my child cry? 
- Papa.

1224
01:07:13,510 --> 01:07:16,150
Do you only love your father, 
and not me?

1225
01:07:16,230 --> 01:07:17,480
You stopped him from going, and not me.

1226
01:07:17,560 --> 01:07:18,850
Don't go.

1227
01:07:18,940 --> 01:07:21,650
- Say it loud and clear. 
- Don't go, uncle.

1228
01:07:23,270 --> 01:07:24,980
But I'll be fine.

1229
01:07:25,270 --> 01:07:27,980
They don't have the 
guts or strength to kill me.

1230
01:07:28,350 --> 01:07:29,350
Okay, then you can go.

1231
01:07:30,020 --> 01:07:32,230
Janvi. Don't get angry, dear.

1232
01:07:32,530 --> 01:07:34,020
I must go.

1233
01:07:34,310 --> 01:07:36,190
Make me swear. Make me swear.

1234
01:07:36,270 --> 01:07:38,150
For my sake, uncle. Don't go.

1235
01:07:38,560 --> 01:07:40,230
Now, what do I do?

1236
01:07:40,310 --> 01:07:43,230
But someone has to go.

1237
01:07:45,190 --> 01:07:46,940
Freedom! Freedom!

1238
01:07:47,490 --> 01:07:51,770
Don't worry, brother-in-law. 
Consider the job done.

1239
01:07:52,210 --> 01:07:53,190
Hey, three idiots.

1240
01:07:53,270 --> 01:07:55,770
Oh no! I hate him.

1241
01:07:56,600 --> 01:07:58,150
Come here. 
Come on.

1242
01:07:58,520 --> 01:07:59,230
Come.

1243
01:08:02,180 --> 01:08:03,350
Take this money.

1244
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:05,150
Money...I'll keep it.

1245
01:08:06,560 --> 01:08:09,230
Its been so long since we delivered 
the car, and they are paying us now.

1246
01:08:09,310 --> 01:08:11,350
But they are paying us at 
the right time. When we're leaving.

1247
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:12,600
- Thank you. 
- Thank you.

1248
01:08:12,680 --> 01:08:13,850
This is not for that.

1249
01:08:14,730 --> 01:08:17,270
They don't allow even their 
servants to leave empty-handed.

1250
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:20,230
They bid them farewell with a gift. 
Am I right, WiFi sir?

1251
01:08:20,310 --> 01:08:23,190
You've to bet this 
money on Lucky in the race.

1252
01:08:23,380 --> 01:08:25,900
- We had other plans... 
- He want to haircut.

1253
01:08:25,980 --> 01:08:28,100
- I am very hungry also... 
- We were going to watch Pagalpanti.

1254
01:08:28,190 --> 01:08:29,310
- Shut up. 
- Sorry.

1255
01:08:30,230 --> 01:08:32,600
Do you really think Lucky can win?

1256
01:08:32,810 --> 01:08:33,900
- No way. 
- I don't think so.

1257
01:08:33,980 --> 01:08:35,310
No way.

1258
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:37,530
Lucky looks like a 
mutt running among horses.

1259
01:08:37,730 --> 01:08:38,480
Shut up.

1260
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:43,480
Whether Lucky wins or not, 
you must bet this money on Lucky.

1261
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:45,350
And yes...

1262
01:08:47,100 --> 01:08:50,650
Don't use your brains, 
because you don't have them.

1263
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:52,560
Understand?

1264
01:08:55,770 --> 01:08:56,980
Look who is talking.

1265
01:08:58,230 --> 01:08:59,770
He's talking about brains.

1266
01:09:00,980 --> 01:09:02,520
So you guys think you have brains.

1267
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:06,560
WiFi sir, we've been working 
here for so long and still survived.

1268
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:08,400
Do you think we could 
do it without brains?

1269
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:10,650
Not possible?

1270
01:09:11,060 --> 01:09:15,590
Do you know who tastes the 
food before we do?

1271
01:09:16,270 --> 01:09:19,390
Have you noticed that 
your dogs are disappearing?

1272
01:09:20,480 --> 01:09:22,240
- Let's go. 
- Come on.

1273
01:09:23,140 --> 01:09:24,650
Oh, God.

1274
01:09:25,100 --> 01:09:27,350
We had severed all 
connections with them.

1275
01:09:27,560 --> 01:09:30,060
Then why did you make 
this link again, WiFi?

1276
01:09:30,150 --> 01:09:31,150
Exactly.

1277
01:09:31,350 --> 01:09:33,150
Brother-in-law, 
the money will be deposited...

1278
01:09:33,230 --> 01:09:35,020
...in our name before the race begins.

1279
01:09:35,690 --> 01:09:38,600
And these people will 
be dead before the race ends.

1280
01:09:38,930 --> 01:09:42,900
That Tulli will chop them to pieces.

1281
01:09:43,150 --> 01:09:46,100
If someone has to die, 
then let it be these three idiots.

1282
01:09:46,190 --> 01:09:48,440
Why should we do? 
Why is?

1283
01:09:54,230 --> 01:09:56,400
Yes. Not to go for Lucky

1284
01:09:56,480 --> 01:09:57,350
Go for Johnny.

1285
01:09:57,440 --> 01:09:59,230
- Is there any gym? 
- Don't know. Why?

1286
01:09:59,310 --> 01:10:01,190
- Where is he gone? 
- I don't know.

1287
01:10:01,310 --> 01:10:03,270
- Here he is. 
- Where were you?

1288
01:10:03,730 --> 01:10:04,810
Getting a tip.

1289
01:10:04,900 --> 01:10:06,020
Smart.

1290
01:10:06,100 --> 01:10:07,930
- See that guy? 
- Who?

1291
01:10:08,010 --> 01:10:09,940
That guy in the middle with white hair.

1292
01:10:10,020 --> 01:10:11,440
- That one. 
- Yeah...

1293
01:10:11,980 --> 01:10:13,310
He was born on the racecourse.

1294
01:10:13,990 --> 01:10:15,850
He spent his life among horses.

1295
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:18,600
Johnny's going to win today's race.

1296
01:10:18,940 --> 01:10:21,350
People call Lucky the cripple 
horse of a cripple owner.

1297
01:10:21,730 --> 01:10:25,060
Whether Lucky is a cripple 
or doesn't have legs at all.

1298
01:10:25,230 --> 01:10:27,190
Okay. 
We're going to bet on him, that's it.

1299
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:29,850
This is our last job, 
let's do it and leave.

1300
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:32,900
After losing we might 
never get to leave.

1301
01:10:33,930 --> 01:10:35,230
And if we win...

1302
01:10:35,310 --> 01:10:38,150
... it will be fun-frolic-luxury 
for the rest of our life.

1303
01:10:38,230 --> 01:10:41,230
Otherwise, where will we go 
with empty-pockets and empty mind?

1304
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:45,730
Whenever he shows us sweet 
dreams it always turns to a nightmare.

1305
01:10:45,810 --> 01:10:48,940
Think about it. 
Ideas are like ice-cream.

1306
01:10:49,350 --> 01:10:51,520
If you think too much, it melts.

1307
01:10:52,230 --> 01:10:53,170
Ouch...

1308
01:10:54,930 --> 01:10:57,190
- Let's bet the money. 
- Come on.

1309
01:10:59,310 --> 01:11:00,520
Where's the bag?

1310
01:11:00,770 --> 01:11:02,350
- Bag? 
- There.

1311
01:11:04,190 --> 01:11:06,430
- Catch them or we'll get ruined. 
- Run! Come on!

1312
01:11:06,810 --> 01:11:07,980
Uncle careful!

1313
01:11:08,060 --> 01:11:10,620
Get out the way. Move.

1314
01:11:10,700 --> 01:11:12,050
Move.

1315
01:11:13,730 --> 01:11:15,080
Catch them.

1316
01:11:15,270 --> 01:11:18,310
- Leave me. 
- No chance.

1317
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:20,710
Run, Sanjana. 
But don't give them this money.

1318
01:11:20,870 --> 01:11:22,230
I won't give you this money.

1319
01:11:22,310 --> 01:11:24,230
We've already suffered a lot of losses.

1320
01:11:24,310 --> 01:11:26,850
Now the scores are settled, 
let uncle go.

1321
01:11:27,850 --> 01:11:28,730
I let him go.

1322
01:11:28,810 --> 01:11:30,350
Just support us a little longer...

1323
01:11:30,440 --> 01:11:31,730
...we're going to double this money.

1324
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:33,310
How?

1325
01:11:33,850 --> 01:11:35,190
Tell them the secret.

1326
01:11:39,940 --> 01:11:42,880
Johnny's going to win today's race.

1327
01:11:43,220 --> 01:11:44,190
Johnny who?

1328
01:11:44,390 --> 01:11:45,190
Horse.

1329
01:11:45,750 --> 01:11:48,230
We heard it from the horse's mouth.

1330
01:11:48,310 --> 01:11:50,730
The horse told us himself.

1331
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:56,600
In fact, 
you should bet whatever you have.

1332
01:11:56,680 --> 01:11:57,770
Correct.

1333
01:11:57,850 --> 01:12:02,400
We can become millionaires without having 
to play Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?

1334
01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:03,810
Wow!

1335
01:12:04,150 --> 01:12:05,730
- Millionaire! 
- Money.

1336
01:12:05,810 --> 01:12:06,850
Go on.

1337
01:12:13,810 --> 01:12:15,470
Come on, Lucky.

1338
01:12:15,610 --> 01:12:17,230
Come on, Lucky.

1339
01:12:17,310 --> 01:12:19,770
Lucky.

1340
01:12:22,230 --> 01:12:23,770
We are going to win.

1341
01:12:24,940 --> 01:12:26,350
Yeah, Lucky, come on.

1342
01:12:29,830 --> 01:12:30,880
Lucky.

1343
01:12:32,770 --> 01:12:34,180
Yes!

1344
01:12:34,390 --> 01:12:35,500
Lucky.

1345
01:12:37,480 --> 01:12:38,710
Johnny.

1346
01:12:38,990 --> 01:12:42,490
See Lucky is running last. 
Horse is like his boss.

1347
01:12:49,190 --> 01:12:50,150
Lucky is losing.

1348
01:12:50,270 --> 01:12:51,600
Do something.

1349
01:12:52,940 --> 01:12:53,820
I told you.

1350
01:12:53,900 --> 01:12:55,670
- Johnny. 
- Johnny.

1351
01:12:55,750 --> 01:12:56,880
I know. You know.

1352
01:12:59,230 --> 01:13:00,190
Yes.

1353
01:13:00,270 --> 01:13:01,500
Yes.

1354
01:13:01,900 --> 01:13:03,790
Come on!

1355
01:13:05,480 --> 01:13:10,940
Lucky, Raja sir's fate 
and reputation rest on you.

1356
01:13:11,020 --> 01:13:13,730
- Run, my son. 
- Lucky my bro...

1357
01:13:13,810 --> 01:13:15,660
- Run! 
- Lucky my bro...

1358
01:13:19,900 --> 01:13:21,850
- Run! 
- Come on you can do this.

1359
01:13:24,350 --> 01:13:26,230
Lucky. Lucky.

1360
01:13:26,310 --> 01:13:27,850
Lucky come front.

1361
01:13:28,020 --> 01:13:29,100
Lucky.

1362
01:13:29,190 --> 01:13:30,920
What happened?

1363
01:13:33,270 --> 01:13:35,020
Go Lucky.

1364
01:13:35,270 --> 01:13:36,550
Come on.

1365
01:13:37,060 --> 01:13:38,470
Papa!

1366
01:13:44,770 --> 01:13:45,730
Run, Johnny.

1367
01:13:46,150 --> 01:13:47,600
- Lucky stop! 
- Run Johnny.

1368
01:13:48,690 --> 01:13:50,770
Look at Lucky go.

1369
01:13:53,770 --> 01:13:54,900
Lucky, stop.

1370
01:14:02,600 --> 01:14:04,270
What are you doing? Johnny!

1371
01:14:04,350 --> 01:14:06,480
Why are you running like a horse?

1372
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:11,280
He's my son. My son...

1373
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:12,480
Lucky, stop.

1374
01:14:14,230 --> 01:14:16,150
He's completely ruined us.

1375
01:14:17,630 --> 01:14:18,760
Lucky.

1376
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:21,410
Uncle! No..!

1377
01:14:22,810 --> 01:14:24,210
Lucky statue.

1378
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:33,320
Oh no!

1379
01:14:35,230 --> 01:14:40,060
Lucky my son, 
you just solved all our problems.

1380
01:14:40,150 --> 01:14:41,600
God bless you.

1381
01:14:53,650 --> 01:14:57,900
You said they are going to torture us.

1382
01:14:58,780 --> 01:15:00,980
What kind of torture is this?

1383
01:15:01,060 --> 01:15:03,610
They are chopping our hands.

1384
01:15:03,810 --> 01:15:07,400
I thought they will hang 
us upside down in the water again.

1385
01:15:07,480 --> 01:15:10,360
Yes. We're used to it now.

1386
01:15:10,450 --> 01:15:13,370
Every time they come up 
with a new idea which is wrong.

1387
01:15:13,450 --> 01:15:14,520
Mummy!

1388
01:15:15,910 --> 01:15:16,990
Be gentle.

1389
01:15:22,060 --> 01:15:24,030
Torture cancel. 
Torture cancel.

1390
01:15:24,110 --> 01:15:25,070
I've another idea.

1391
01:15:25,150 --> 01:15:26,320
Another idea?

1392
01:15:26,510 --> 01:15:27,700
Hear me out.

1393
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:29,280
Let's run away.

1394
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:31,200
Run away?

1395
01:15:31,280 --> 01:15:33,320
You've lost your mind.

1396
01:15:33,450 --> 01:15:34,990
Where do you think we'll go?

1397
01:15:35,070 --> 01:15:36,900
Sooner or later we'll get caught.

1398
01:15:36,990 --> 01:15:39,150
And what will you do by saving 
your hands for a couple of more days?

1399
01:15:39,450 --> 01:15:41,240
Fine. 
Then you get your hands chopped today...

1400
01:15:41,490 --> 01:15:42,900
...and I'll get it 
chopped after a few days.

1401
01:15:42,990 --> 01:15:44,990
Wait man.

1402
01:15:47,150 --> 01:15:48,490
And what about them?

1403
01:15:48,900 --> 01:15:49,640
Who?

1404
01:15:50,450 --> 01:15:51,780
These poor souls.

1405
01:15:51,990 --> 01:15:54,820
These sad, helpless, 
poor people lying on the ground.

1406
01:15:57,200 --> 01:15:58,820
I'll take their money, 
it'll come in handy.

1407
01:15:59,570 --> 01:16:01,610
I am sure uncle has some too.

1408
01:16:03,880 --> 01:16:05,360
- Is that all? 
- They are poor people.

1409
01:16:05,450 --> 01:16:06,490
Thanks, uncle.

1410
01:16:08,240 --> 01:16:10,280
I've loaded the consignment, sir.

1411
01:16:10,360 --> 01:16:12,850
I am leaving now 
and will reach Scotland by evening.

1412
01:16:13,320 --> 01:16:14,820
- Yes, sir. 
- Did you hear?

1413
01:16:15,150 --> 01:16:16,990
Scotland. 
Outside the city.

1414
01:16:17,070 --> 01:16:18,700
He can never find us there.

1415
01:16:22,700 --> 01:16:28,150
When that cripple and WiFi 
find out that we've fled...

1416
01:16:29,320 --> 01:16:30,780
...they will feel really bad.

1417
01:16:33,490 --> 01:16:33,990
Hello.

1418
01:16:34,070 --> 01:16:35,740
Pick up some stuff 
from Raja sir's place.

1419
01:16:35,820 --> 01:16:37,790
I already left for Scotland.

1420
01:16:37,870 --> 01:16:38,740
It's urgent.

1421
01:16:38,820 --> 01:16:39,990
Fine, I'll turn around.

1422
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:43,240
What's up.

1423
01:16:43,990 --> 01:16:46,530
- What's up? - Yeah, what are 
you going to say about it?

1424
01:16:46,610 --> 01:16:47,450
What?

1425
01:16:47,810 --> 01:16:50,200
You...

1426
01:16:50,820 --> 01:16:53,360
I couldn't be any more formal with you.

1427
01:16:53,450 --> 01:16:54,990
I know one...

1428
01:16:56,570 --> 01:16:58,950
Has all that money gone to your heads?

1429
01:16:59,150 --> 01:17:00,500
What are they saying?

1430
01:17:00,700 --> 01:17:02,030
Put it on speaker.

1431
01:17:02,990 --> 01:17:06,070
Are you so high that you've 
forgotten who you're speaking to?

1432
01:17:06,210 --> 01:17:07,740
You?

1433
01:17:10,240 --> 01:17:12,700
I know how brave you are.

1434
01:17:12,900 --> 01:17:15,530
You hide in the first spot 
you see when there's gunfire.

1435
01:17:15,860 --> 01:17:20,360
Raja sir got shot in the leg 
because you were hiding behind it.

1436
01:17:21,380 --> 01:17:22,910
Is that your reputation in the market?

1437
01:17:22,990 --> 01:17:25,770
Let's not talk about 
reputation shall we, cripple?

1438
01:17:25,850 --> 01:17:30,610
Rascals...you're misbehaving 
with Raja sir.

1439
01:17:30,950 --> 01:17:35,280
Don't forget I'll chuck 
all of you in boiling oil.

1440
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:36,110
Shut up, confectioner.

1441
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:43,900
Use that little brain of 
yours which in that huge head.

1442
01:17:43,990 --> 01:17:45,770
And listen carefully.

1443
01:17:46,490 --> 01:17:50,570
Now listen, 
we've quit your job and this city.

1444
01:17:50,990 --> 01:17:56,400
Don't wait up for us, 
because we're never coming back.

1445
01:17:56,490 --> 01:17:57,610
- Understand? 
- Understand.

1446
01:17:57,740 --> 01:17:59,700
Duffer, idiot.

1447
01:18:02,390 --> 01:18:03,820
Scotland so soon.

1448
01:18:03,900 --> 01:18:07,310
- Yeah... 
- What shortcut did he take?

1449
01:18:07,390 --> 01:18:08,500
He really fast.

1450
01:18:08,580 --> 01:18:09,820
Oh no!

1451
01:18:09,900 --> 01:18:14,110
Hello, Javed WiFi here. 
Send our boys in all directions.

1452
01:18:14,430 --> 01:18:17,530
- And bring me those three. Right now. 
- Which three, sir?

1453
01:18:17,610 --> 01:18:19,070
Mind your own business.

1454
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:20,780
Load those three boxes on the truck.

1455
01:18:20,860 --> 01:18:22,360
- Can you drive? 
- Yes.

1456
01:18:22,780 --> 01:18:23,860
Then drive.

1457
01:18:23,950 --> 01:18:25,070
Drive the truck.

1458
01:18:25,150 --> 01:18:27,690
- But I don't have a licence. 
- Licence...

1459
01:18:27,770 --> 01:18:28,860
What a coincidence.

1460
01:18:28,950 --> 01:18:30,400
He's looking for three guys.

1461
01:18:30,650 --> 01:18:32,530
You called me here for three boxes.

1462
01:18:32,610 --> 01:18:35,280
Now I'll take these three boxes 
along with three guys to Scotland.

1463
01:18:36,280 --> 01:18:37,490
Which three guys?

1464
01:18:37,860 --> 01:18:40,490
Three nice people. 
I picked them up at the racecourse.

1465
01:18:40,570 --> 01:18:41,860
- Racecourse? 
- Yes.

1466
01:18:42,360 --> 01:18:44,990
Brother-in-law... 
Brother-in-law, I found them.

1467
01:18:45,490 --> 01:18:47,780
Brother-in-law... 
Brother-in-law, I found them.

1468
01:18:48,990 --> 01:18:51,320
- Where are they? 
- They were right here, sir. They were.

1469
01:18:51,400 --> 01:18:53,240
Did they turn invisible then?

1470
01:18:53,320 --> 01:18:54,570
Oh, God.

1471
01:18:54,650 --> 01:18:57,110
Find them. 
They must be somewhere around here.

1472
01:18:57,200 --> 01:18:59,860
- Chandu. 
- Find them. Why are you standing?

1473
01:18:59,950 --> 01:19:01,150
Chandu.

1474
01:19:01,240 --> 01:19:03,990
Big words from a weak 
stomach...this is a big deal.

1475
01:19:04,070 --> 01:19:05,450
- Look in the box. 
- Papa.

1476
01:19:05,530 --> 01:19:06,780
Check over there.

1477
01:19:06,860 --> 01:19:09,740
Find Chandu. Find Chandu.

1478
01:19:09,820 --> 01:19:12,530
I am looking for him. Find them.

1479
01:19:12,610 --> 01:19:16,700
- Why are you searching? 
- Close the gate. Close the gate.

1480
01:19:16,780 --> 01:19:19,900
No. Let it stay open.

1481
01:19:19,990 --> 01:19:21,200
Priest...

1482
01:19:21,280 --> 01:19:23,910
Let them go.

1483
01:19:23,990 --> 01:19:26,400
- Why you... 
- Get lost. Get lost.

1484
01:19:26,700 --> 01:19:29,060
Or else I'll ruin your horoscope.

1485
01:19:29,140 --> 01:19:30,780
- Fine. 
- Leave.

1486
01:19:31,530 --> 01:19:32,880
Find them.

1487
01:19:33,030 --> 01:19:36,070
You will come to know. Wait sometime.

1488
01:19:36,610 --> 01:19:39,730
Search Chandu. Come out!

1489
01:19:45,530 --> 01:19:47,820
Everyone's been having 
bad luck since they got here.

1490
01:20:19,740 --> 01:20:22,490
Are these three in my horoscope now?

1491
01:20:29,310 --> 01:20:31,950
Now I get it. 
You three in my car.

1492
01:20:32,030 --> 01:20:34,540
- Come out. 
- Priest...

1493
01:20:35,570 --> 01:20:39,610
Priest, WiFi's men must 
be all around the city now.

1494
01:20:39,700 --> 01:20:42,070
If they find us, 
we'll get in a lot of trouble.

1495
01:20:42,150 --> 01:20:46,780
Priest, don't you want 
us out of your lives forever.

1496
01:20:46,860 --> 01:20:47,590
Of course.

1497
01:20:47,670 --> 01:20:49,900
Then only you can 
get us out of the city.

1498
01:20:49,980 --> 01:20:52,990
I would rather get you off this planet.

1499
01:20:53,070 --> 01:20:54,400
But what do I do?

1500
01:20:54,490 --> 01:20:57,780
Priest, you find solutions for everyone.

1501
01:20:57,860 --> 01:20:59,660
So find one for us as well.

1502
01:20:59,740 --> 01:21:00,950
Take your time. Take your time.

1503
01:21:01,240 --> 01:21:03,110
- Until then we'll stay at your home. 
- No.

1504
01:21:03,200 --> 01:21:05,740
Not in my house. 
I'll think of something.

1505
01:21:06,490 --> 01:21:08,190
- Let me think. 
- Think.

1506
01:21:10,150 --> 01:21:11,820
The priest got us amazing jobs.

1507
01:21:11,900 --> 01:21:12,820
Yeah.

1508
01:21:12,990 --> 01:21:14,870
The circus guys will 
take us to America tomorrow...

1509
01:21:14,950 --> 01:21:16,650
...and life will be 
great once we get there.

1510
01:21:16,740 --> 01:21:18,460
And Trump's life will be upset.

1511
01:21:18,990 --> 01:21:21,700
America boasts to be a superpower.

1512
01:21:21,780 --> 01:21:25,240
They don't know that as soon 
as you set foot on their land...

1513
01:21:25,320 --> 01:21:27,200
...it will turn into Uganda.

1514
01:21:27,280 --> 01:21:28,320
Isn't that right, Chandu?

1515
01:21:28,650 --> 01:21:29,570
Where is Chandu?

1516
01:21:29,650 --> 01:21:34,900
Jaan, even a stubborn rooster 
gets platted eventually.

1517
01:21:35,150 --> 01:21:36,950
We'll have to leave this country.

1518
01:21:37,030 --> 01:21:41,030
When someone enters my heart, he can't 
take a step without my permission...

1519
01:21:41,110 --> 01:21:42,820
...and you're talking 
about leaving the country.

1520
01:21:42,950 --> 01:21:46,570
My Jaan, you're not just my Jaan 
but also my life.

1521
01:21:46,650 --> 01:21:48,530
You have the address, don't you? 
Just get down here.

1522
01:21:48,610 --> 01:21:49,360
Coming.

1523
01:21:50,590 --> 01:21:51,540
Rascal.

1524
01:21:52,570 --> 01:21:54,950
We're hiding for our life...

1525
01:21:55,280 --> 01:21:57,860
...and you're telling 
people about our whereabouts.

1526
01:21:57,990 --> 01:22:00,950
She won't tell anyone. She is not crazy.

1527
01:22:05,530 --> 01:22:07,110
I am not going to the circus.

1528
01:22:08,320 --> 01:22:09,950
Nor did Chandu call me.

1529
01:22:11,150 --> 01:22:12,030
Bye.

1530
01:22:17,860 --> 01:22:18,650
Catch him.

1531
01:22:18,740 --> 01:22:20,990
- How did Raja and WiFi get here? 
- Catch them.

1532
01:22:21,110 --> 01:22:24,150
- How did they find out where we are? 
- All thanks to his Jaan.

1533
01:22:25,990 --> 01:22:28,240
Catch them. Search there.

1534
01:22:28,450 --> 01:22:29,820
They are not real clowns.

1535
01:22:29,900 --> 01:22:31,400
Check this side..

1536
01:22:35,700 --> 01:22:42,280
"...give me some coin or some breakfast."

1537
01:22:43,280 --> 01:22:44,950
Where is gone?

1538
01:22:49,180 --> 01:22:51,010
We're not thieves. We're beggars.

1539
01:22:51,240 --> 01:22:52,030
Please, help us.

1540
01:22:52,150 --> 01:22:54,570
- Help. Help. 
- Keep moving. Get out.

1541
01:22:55,200 --> 01:22:57,650
Keep moving.

1542
01:22:58,280 --> 01:22:59,950
He sounded familiar.

1543
01:23:00,250 --> 01:23:01,820
- Shall we check? 
- Yes.

1544
01:23:02,950 --> 01:23:03,780
Speak again.

1545
01:23:04,990 --> 01:23:06,400
Pull his nose.

1546
01:23:08,080 --> 01:23:09,430
- Raj? 
- See.

1547
01:23:10,530 --> 01:23:14,070
You didn't leave a single 
dime in my pocket to even buy breakfast.

1548
01:23:14,150 --> 01:23:15,490
This is completely wrong.

1549
01:23:15,570 --> 01:23:18,860
Uncle had to wash dirty 
laundry in exchange for food.

1550
01:23:18,950 --> 01:23:19,740
So sad...

1551
01:23:19,820 --> 01:23:23,280
- And she had to wash dirty plates. 
- What?

1552
01:23:23,360 --> 01:23:25,200
- Baby... 
- What are you doing?

1553
01:23:25,280 --> 01:23:26,240
Excuse me.

1554
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:28,240
- What happened? 
- They are coming.

1555
01:23:29,400 --> 01:23:31,240
There. Yes there.

1556
01:23:31,320 --> 01:23:34,240
If they find out you two are with us, 
then they won't spare you.

1557
01:23:34,320 --> 01:23:37,260
We won't be able to 
live without you either.

1558
01:23:37,410 --> 01:23:40,650
Okay. Come on, 
let's all die together. Come on.

1559
01:23:43,020 --> 01:23:44,250
Where is all gone?

1560
01:23:44,870 --> 01:23:45,630
Lets go.

1561
01:23:45,830 --> 01:23:46,950
WiFi.

1562
01:23:47,450 --> 01:23:48,780
Catch them, they are escaping.

1563
01:23:49,110 --> 01:23:53,190
- In the truck. 
- Catch them. Catch them.

1564
01:23:53,400 --> 01:23:55,730
Move, move. Catch them.

1565
01:23:55,860 --> 01:23:57,910
Go. Get the car.

1566
01:24:03,950 --> 01:24:05,100
Stop.

1567
01:24:08,520 --> 01:24:09,820
I'll kill you.

1568
01:24:11,110 --> 01:24:12,240
Papa...

1569
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:15,450
No one's going to shoot. 
Janvi's with them too.

1570
01:24:24,610 --> 01:24:26,110
Indecent behaviour

1571
01:24:26,200 --> 01:24:28,360
- We're stuck. 
- Get them apart.

1572
01:24:29,400 --> 01:24:30,820
Come on, fast.

1573
01:24:30,900 --> 01:24:32,110
That's instant glue...

1574
01:24:32,200 --> 01:24:34,360
Uncle, this company claims that...

1575
01:24:34,450 --> 01:24:37,530
...their glue can even fix broken bones 
which the doctors can't fix.

1576
01:24:37,610 --> 01:24:38,860
They are here.

1577
01:24:38,950 --> 01:24:44,320
Rascals. You think you can 
flee with our money and our daughter.

1578
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:48,730
I won't let that happened? 
I won't spare them.

1579
01:24:48,950 --> 01:24:50,750
Hit him. Hit.

1580
01:24:51,990 --> 01:24:52,850
Instant glue.

1581
01:24:55,990 --> 01:24:59,240
My shoes..

1582
01:24:59,820 --> 01:25:01,740
What have you done?

1583
01:25:04,740 --> 01:25:05,950
What are you two doing?

1584
01:25:06,080 --> 01:25:07,570
Aren't you brother and sister?

1585
01:25:07,650 --> 01:25:10,200
She is your sister... 
I mean your niece.

1586
01:25:10,280 --> 01:25:11,820
She is my love.

1587
01:25:11,950 --> 01:25:13,750
Bloody...

1588
01:25:13,830 --> 01:25:17,150
I would've shown you if I wasn't stuck.

1589
01:25:17,240 --> 01:25:19,030
I am telling you because you're stuck.

1590
01:25:19,150 --> 01:25:20,070
Leave her.

1591
01:25:21,200 --> 01:25:22,070
Get lost.

1592
01:25:23,740 --> 01:25:26,610
Uncle. The enemy of 
the enemy is a friend.

1593
01:25:26,700 --> 01:25:28,950
- Yes. 
- Help him.

1594
01:25:29,200 --> 01:25:30,440
Come on!

1595
01:25:30,900 --> 01:25:32,320
Stick them too.

1596
01:25:34,450 --> 01:25:35,650
What are you doing?

1597
01:25:35,740 --> 01:25:37,990
What do you think you're doing?

1598
01:25:39,950 --> 01:25:40,740
Fools.

1599
01:25:41,190 --> 01:25:43,230
Get we out.

1600
01:25:43,310 --> 01:25:44,770
Get us out.

1601
01:25:44,950 --> 01:25:47,500
- What happened this? 
- I will see you.

1602
01:25:57,950 --> 01:26:00,200
You made her stick too.

1603
01:26:01,490 --> 01:26:03,530
What has happened this, WiFi?

1604
01:26:03,610 --> 01:26:05,950
They stuck you too.

1605
01:26:06,530 --> 01:26:08,110
- Brother-in-law. 
- Yes.

1606
01:26:08,200 --> 01:26:11,570
Do you see what they are up to?

1607
01:26:13,590 --> 01:26:17,700
This means she is not 
completely out of her mind.

1608
01:26:17,780 --> 01:26:20,860
She was giving Chandu her full support.

1609
01:26:20,940 --> 01:26:22,900
Very good. I am so happy.

1610
01:26:23,030 --> 01:26:24,820
- You are happy. 
- Yes.

1611
01:26:24,900 --> 01:26:26,610
Enough of this.

1612
01:26:26,700 --> 01:26:28,490
Where is our money?

1613
01:26:28,570 --> 01:26:29,860
Where is our money?

1614
01:26:29,950 --> 01:26:32,450
Floating in mid-air and 
still worried about your money.

1615
01:26:32,530 --> 01:26:34,070
We put it in the bank.

1616
01:26:34,150 --> 01:26:36,150
For your future.

1617
01:26:36,240 --> 01:26:37,610
In the bank of Uganda.

1618
01:26:37,700 --> 01:26:39,200
Bank of Uganda?

1619
01:26:39,280 --> 01:26:40,320
Uganda.

1620
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:43,780
Did you put it in the bank 
or gave it away as charity?

1621
01:26:43,860 --> 01:26:44,950
Uganda.

1622
01:26:45,370 --> 01:26:47,290
Hold me tight.

1623
01:26:54,780 --> 01:26:56,780
- Raja sir... 
- I want to come up.

1624
01:27:11,820 --> 01:27:13,530
- Tulli bro... 
- Yes, Bulli bro.

1625
01:27:13,610 --> 01:27:14,750
Look.

1626
01:27:16,430 --> 01:27:18,150
Turn the car around.

1627
01:27:19,710 --> 01:27:21,000
Bro...

1628
01:27:22,830 --> 01:27:24,430
Look who is coming now.

1629
01:27:28,490 --> 01:27:31,480
You're firing at us.

1630
01:27:35,150 --> 01:27:36,070
Put some more.

1631
01:27:36,150 --> 01:27:38,790
- Stick them. Stick them. 
- Tulli.

1632
01:27:41,080 --> 01:27:42,630
Hey fasto.

1633
01:27:43,820 --> 01:27:45,410
Lookout.

1634
01:27:51,780 --> 01:27:53,690
- Are you okay? 
- Raj!

1635
01:27:55,900 --> 01:27:57,090
Truck is coming.

1636
01:27:57,950 --> 01:27:58,850
Truck.

1637
01:28:06,300 --> 01:28:08,290
Leave me..

1638
01:28:10,450 --> 01:28:11,610
Look out, brother-in-law.

1639
01:28:11,700 --> 01:28:13,450
Who the hell are you guys?

1640
01:28:13,530 --> 01:28:14,910
Get out of my truck.

1641
01:28:17,040 --> 01:28:17,770
Brother-in-law

1642
01:28:23,070 --> 01:28:24,120
Hold on!

1643
01:28:24,200 --> 01:28:26,620
- Bridge. 
- Bridge is ahead.

1644
01:28:26,700 --> 01:28:28,150
We'll have to jump.

1645
01:28:28,240 --> 01:28:29,070
Stop the truck.

1646
01:28:29,150 --> 01:28:30,400
- No! 
- Jump!

1647
01:28:31,780 --> 01:28:32,910
Jump!

1648
01:28:32,990 --> 01:28:33,900
Where are you going?

1649
01:28:33,980 --> 01:28:37,380
They left. What about us WiFi?

1650
01:28:40,860 --> 01:28:44,870
We should spend the night in that house 
instead of freezing to death out here.

1651
01:28:44,950 --> 01:28:46,570
So what if that place is haunted.

1652
01:28:47,400 --> 01:28:49,410
At least we'll have 
a roof over our head.

1653
01:28:49,490 --> 01:28:50,900
Didn't you hear what the villagers said?

1654
01:28:51,860 --> 01:28:55,530
Whoever went in there, never came out.

1655
01:28:55,610 --> 01:28:57,610
Even their dead body was never found.

1656
01:28:57,780 --> 01:29:01,740
She is a witch, a ghost that 
feasts on human blood.

1657
01:29:02,780 --> 01:29:03,990
Stop scaring me.

1658
01:29:04,070 --> 01:29:06,150
What are you saying? 
There is no such thing as a ghost.

1659
01:29:07,450 --> 01:29:10,950
I've never seen a real ghost 
except for my father and uncle.

1660
01:29:11,200 --> 01:29:12,400
God promise.

1661
01:29:12,490 --> 01:29:13,530
Show me that ghost.

1662
01:29:13,610 --> 01:29:15,700
You're so naive.

1663
01:29:22,780 --> 01:29:24,820
We can't stay in this village either?

1664
01:29:24,900 --> 01:29:27,570
Those brothers-in-law have 
their men looking everywhere.

1665
01:29:37,640 --> 01:29:40,640
Why is the weather outside 
haunted homes always bad?

1666
01:29:41,790 --> 01:29:44,700
Why don't they ever put oil in the door, 
it always squeaks.

1667
01:30:03,580 --> 01:30:07,930
"Come a little closer 
and steal my peace."

1668
01:30:08,980 --> 01:30:13,300
"Take me far away from every sight."

1669
01:30:14,280 --> 01:30:19,450
"Come a little closer 
and steal my peace."

1670
01:30:19,670 --> 01:30:24,200
"Take me far away from every sight."

1671
01:30:25,070 --> 01:30:27,650
"How do I say what's happening to me?"

1672
01:30:27,860 --> 01:30:30,200
"My heart's fallen for you."

1673
01:30:30,280 --> 01:30:33,100
"Come see me once..."

1674
01:30:34,950 --> 01:30:37,280
"My heart's crazy for you..."

1675
01:30:37,360 --> 01:30:39,950
"...making my life difficult."

1676
01:30:40,030 --> 01:30:42,780
"What do I do now?"

1677
01:30:45,450 --> 01:30:47,990
"My heart's crazy for you..."

1678
01:30:48,070 --> 01:30:50,700
"...making my life difficult."

1679
01:30:50,780 --> 01:30:53,150
"What do I do now?"

1680
01:31:23,580 --> 01:31:26,150
"I won't let you go..."

1681
01:31:26,240 --> 01:31:28,990
"...now that you are here."

1682
01:31:29,070 --> 01:31:34,320
"Because you've stolen my slumber."

1683
01:31:34,400 --> 01:31:38,610
"I've been waiting 
for you...my beloved."

1684
01:31:39,650 --> 01:31:42,240
"My eyes have been pining."

1685
01:31:42,320 --> 01:31:44,990
"Calling you closer to me."

1686
01:31:45,070 --> 01:31:50,320
"I want to dwell in your breath now."

1687
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:54,780
"Now I know that you're mine."

1688
01:31:55,740 --> 01:31:58,400
"How do I say what's happening to me?"

1689
01:31:58,490 --> 01:32:00,880
"My heart's fallen for you."

1690
01:32:00,960 --> 01:32:04,200
"Come see me once..."

1691
01:32:05,490 --> 01:32:08,030
"My heart's crazy for you..."

1692
01:32:08,110 --> 01:32:10,570
"...making my life difficult."

1693
01:32:10,650 --> 01:32:14,110
"What do I do now?"

1694
01:32:16,030 --> 01:32:18,530
"My heart's crazy for you..."

1695
01:32:18,610 --> 01:32:21,280
"...making my life difficult."

1696
01:32:21,450 --> 01:32:23,740
"What do I do now?"

1697
01:32:43,900 --> 01:32:45,900
Sir, here's your stick.

1698
01:32:47,150 --> 01:32:48,650
It's a cane.

1699
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:50,150
Yes.

1700
01:32:50,520 --> 01:32:51,650
And what is this?

1701
01:32:52,400 --> 01:32:53,490
Donkey instead of a horse.

1702
01:32:53,570 --> 01:32:55,030
One can only get 
a donkey for 100 pounds.

1703
01:32:55,110 --> 01:32:56,200
How can we get a horse?

1704
01:32:56,490 --> 01:32:57,570
Yeah.

1705
01:33:01,070 --> 01:33:02,860
Donkey is okay.

1706
01:33:03,610 --> 01:33:06,900
But what good is this small cane?

1707
01:33:06,990 --> 01:33:08,650
- Big words from a weak stomach... 
- Wait a minute.

1708
01:33:08,990 --> 01:33:10,780
That will be 500 pounds. 
We'll get you a new one.

1709
01:33:10,990 --> 01:33:11,860
Yes.

1710
01:33:12,450 --> 01:33:13,820
You'll get your salary.

1711
01:33:14,200 --> 01:33:15,900
Get out! Get out!

1712
01:33:16,280 --> 01:33:17,240
Yes, sir.

1713
01:33:19,890 --> 01:33:25,070
These bloody three idiots 
have turned us into paupers.

1714
01:33:35,450 --> 01:33:36,360
Welcome...

1715
01:33:36,450 --> 01:33:38,450
Modi sir, take a seat.

1716
01:33:38,900 --> 01:33:42,030
What brings you to our little place?

1717
01:33:42,360 --> 01:33:43,740
Place...

1718
01:33:44,110 --> 01:33:46,990
Bad habit take long to depart.

1719
01:33:49,490 --> 01:33:50,530
What would you like?

1720
01:33:51,490 --> 01:33:52,530
Money.

1721
01:33:53,990 --> 01:33:57,620
Rumours are rife in the market 
that you guys have been ruined.

1722
01:33:57,870 --> 01:34:02,740
The market where this rumour 
is rife is right in front of you.

1723
01:34:02,990 --> 01:34:04,490
Isn't it true...

1724
01:34:05,780 --> 01:34:11,070
...that your strong room went 
up in flames where your money was kept?

1725
01:34:13,030 --> 01:34:15,490
It was our money, and it's gone now.

1726
01:34:16,240 --> 01:34:17,530
Happens sometimes...

1727
01:34:17,780 --> 01:34:20,070
Sometimes people fume 
when they see other's money...

1728
01:34:20,740 --> 01:34:23,120
...and sometimes their 
money goes up in flames.

1729
01:34:24,200 --> 01:34:25,280
And my money.

1730
01:34:26,110 --> 01:34:27,320
We've invested.

1731
01:34:27,400 --> 01:34:28,990
So we can make quadruple.

1732
01:34:29,070 --> 01:34:30,990
But I said make double-triple.

1733
01:34:31,070 --> 01:34:32,320
That was your calculation.

1734
01:34:32,550 --> 01:34:33,530
This is our arithmetic.

1735
01:34:33,760 --> 01:34:34,860
Bravo.

1736
01:34:35,110 --> 01:34:36,570
Big words from a big stomach.

1737
01:34:36,820 --> 01:34:37,900
- Modi sir... 
- Thank you.

1738
01:34:39,310 --> 01:34:41,200
I am Raja sir.

1739
01:34:41,610 --> 01:34:45,360
If I shrug my sweater, it rains money.

1740
01:34:45,450 --> 01:34:46,820
He can't even pay our salary.

1741
01:34:46,990 --> 01:34:48,280
Small words from a small stomach.

1742
01:34:48,360 --> 01:34:51,900
The shrug your sweater 
and return my money.

1743
01:34:52,570 --> 01:34:53,900
We cannot do that.

1744
01:34:55,740 --> 01:34:59,070
I mean we can't give it today, 
so says the priest.

1745
01:34:59,360 --> 01:35:01,360
They can't even pay you tomorrow.

1746
01:35:04,150 --> 01:35:09,030
I mean...they can't give 
anything for the next two days.

1747
01:35:09,520 --> 01:35:10,570
Not even free advice.

1748
01:35:10,850 --> 01:35:11,700
Two days...

1749
01:35:12,820 --> 01:35:14,030
48 hours.

1750
01:35:15,070 --> 01:35:18,650
After that...no more time.

1751
01:35:19,400 --> 01:35:20,370
Goodbye.

1752
01:35:20,450 --> 01:35:21,400
Niraj, sir.

1753
01:35:21,780 --> 01:35:24,020
You can come an hour earlier.

1754
01:35:30,900 --> 01:35:33,030
We've no money for food.

1755
01:35:33,570 --> 01:35:35,740
How are we going to pay these wolves?

1756
01:35:36,710 --> 01:35:39,280
And why did you tell 
them 47 hours instead of 48?

1757
01:35:39,360 --> 01:35:42,280
What could we do with an extra hour?

1758
01:35:44,890 --> 01:35:46,010
Good morning. Good morning.

1759
01:35:47,260 --> 01:35:48,090
Wake up, everyone.

1760
01:35:49,680 --> 01:35:50,680
Come on.

1761
01:35:51,220 --> 01:35:53,510
- I've brought breakfast for everyone. 
- I haven't done anything.

1762
01:35:54,090 --> 01:35:57,270
- You should've brought some 
black coffee, brown sugar. - Thanks.

1763
01:35:58,430 --> 01:35:59,800
Where is uncle?

1764
01:35:59,890 --> 01:36:01,220
I don't see him anywhere.

1765
01:36:01,660 --> 01:36:02,680
Where could he go?

1766
01:36:02,760 --> 01:36:04,640
He hasn't gone anywhere. 
He didn't come out.

1767
01:36:04,720 --> 01:36:07,220
Last night he fainted 
instead because of the ghost.

1768
01:36:07,510 --> 01:36:08,390
Faint!

1769
01:36:08,470 --> 01:36:10,840
I ran over his chest myself.

1770
01:36:11,050 --> 01:36:13,250
- What? 
- Why didn't you wake him up?

1771
01:36:13,330 --> 01:36:16,510
If she had stayed back to wake him up 
wouldn't the ghost has taken her too.

1772
01:36:16,720 --> 01:36:17,510
That's a point.

1773
01:36:17,590 --> 01:36:19,010
You should have at least told me.

1774
01:36:19,090 --> 01:36:20,640
Should I have told them, Chand?

1775
01:36:20,720 --> 01:36:21,820
No, Jaan.

1776
01:36:22,180 --> 01:36:24,140
I wonder how he is 
and in what condition.

1777
01:36:24,430 --> 01:36:25,510
If he's still around.

1778
01:36:27,050 --> 01:36:30,840
I mean she's a ghost. 
Dinner...breakfast...

1779
01:36:31,140 --> 01:36:32,680
The ghost must have 
made something out of him.

1780
01:36:32,760 --> 01:36:33,930
No, I'll go take a look.

1781
01:36:34,010 --> 01:36:35,140
- No Sanjana. 
- Wait.

1782
01:36:35,410 --> 01:36:38,220
Ghosts go after beautiful girls first.

1783
01:36:39,610 --> 01:36:41,690
Because they just hate competition.

1784
01:36:41,770 --> 01:36:43,260
Why don't one of you go inside?

1785
01:36:45,860 --> 01:36:47,970
She sleeps in the day. 
She is harmless.

1786
01:36:48,190 --> 01:36:50,550
I've heard that they 
are active throughout the day.

1787
01:36:50,640 --> 01:36:51,430
Correct. I heard that too.

1788
01:36:51,510 --> 01:36:54,090
But someone will have to go. 
So who will it be?

1789
01:36:54,510 --> 01:36:55,680
What do you mean by who?

1790
01:36:55,760 --> 01:36:56,800
Who has the biceps?

1791
01:36:57,220 --> 01:36:58,800
Who has 6-pack abs?

1792
01:36:59,970 --> 01:37:01,090
- Him. 
- Right.

1793
01:37:01,300 --> 01:37:02,140
Go on then.

1794
01:37:02,430 --> 01:37:04,430
With a body like yours...

1795
01:37:04,550 --> 01:37:07,220
...you can scare that ghost out of wits.

1796
01:37:08,240 --> 01:37:12,010
These 6-pack abs can 
be attained in any gym.

1797
01:37:12,090 --> 01:37:14,340
But no gym in this world 
helps you develop courage.

1798
01:37:15,010 --> 01:37:16,800
And I don't have the courage...

1799
01:37:18,720 --> 01:37:22,050
Raj...Uncle is the only family I've got.

1800
01:37:24,760 --> 01:37:26,090
So sad.

1801
01:37:26,720 --> 01:37:27,890
He was a nice man.

1802
01:37:28,050 --> 01:37:29,890
Poor guy became the ghost's breakfast.

1803
01:37:36,140 --> 01:37:37,760
What madness is this?

1804
01:37:38,300 --> 01:37:39,550
Why am I going inside?

1805
01:37:40,370 --> 01:37:41,800
I am gone mad.

1806
01:37:42,830 --> 01:37:45,010
Despite what people say 
about your luck and mind.

1807
01:37:45,520 --> 01:37:47,010
You have a heart of gold.

1808
01:37:52,140 --> 01:37:53,180
Uncle.

1809
01:37:53,740 --> 01:37:54,700
She will hear us.

1810
01:38:23,340 --> 01:38:24,930
Uncle. Uncle.

1811
01:38:28,430 --> 01:38:29,300
Check him.

1812
01:38:32,550 --> 01:38:34,590
- He still has a heartbeat. 
- Wake him up.

1813
01:38:37,640 --> 01:38:40,090
Uncle. Uncle. 
I'm returning your money with interest.

1814
01:38:40,330 --> 01:38:41,890
Money... 
Where's my money?

1815
01:38:41,970 --> 01:38:43,590
I only said that to wake you up.

1816
01:38:44,240 --> 01:38:45,300
Forget about the money.

1817
01:38:45,450 --> 01:38:48,970
- Let's get out of here. Come on. 
- Okay. My specs.

1818
01:38:49,340 --> 01:38:50,230
- Hurry up. 
- My cap.

1819
01:38:50,840 --> 01:38:52,140
Come. Let's go.

1820
01:39:16,760 --> 01:39:18,180
What are you doing?

1821
01:39:18,890 --> 01:39:20,220
Beautiful girl.

1822
01:39:25,220 --> 01:39:28,340
I want to turn into 
a ghost just for her.

1823
01:39:29,010 --> 01:39:30,140
I love you.

1824
01:40:08,340 --> 01:40:11,010
"I'll be yours forever..."

1825
01:40:11,090 --> 01:40:13,760
"...lose me in your arms."

1826
01:40:13,840 --> 01:40:18,930
"And I'll dwell inside you."

1827
01:40:19,010 --> 01:40:23,390
"I admit my love."

1828
01:40:24,390 --> 01:40:27,010
"My heart's fallen for you..."

1829
01:40:27,090 --> 01:40:29,720
"...because you're the only one for me."

1830
01:40:29,800 --> 01:40:34,970
"Why did you steal 
my peace and slumber."

1831
01:40:35,190 --> 01:40:39,510
"Tell me why did you make me restless."

1832
01:40:40,390 --> 01:40:42,930
"How do I say what's happening to me?"

1833
01:40:43,170 --> 01:40:45,510
"My heart's fallen for you."

1834
01:40:45,590 --> 01:40:49,020
"Come see me once..."

1835
01:40:50,260 --> 01:40:52,680
"My heart's crazy for you..."

1836
01:40:52,760 --> 01:40:55,300
"...making my life difficult."

1837
01:40:55,390 --> 01:40:57,970
"What do I do now?"

1838
01:41:00,950 --> 01:41:03,300
"My heart's crazy for you..."

1839
01:41:03,550 --> 01:41:05,930
"...making my life difficult."

1840
01:41:06,360 --> 01:41:08,970
"What do I do now?"

1841
01:41:23,390 --> 01:41:26,640
Come on, guys. 
She definitely has some kind of reason.

1842
01:41:27,010 --> 01:41:28,760
No one pretends to be a ghost for fun.

1843
01:41:29,180 --> 01:41:31,590
Look at her face. 
I mean look at her.

1844
01:41:33,450 --> 01:41:35,260
Look at her innocent face.

1845
01:41:35,510 --> 01:41:37,800
Look at her painful eyes.

1846
01:41:38,340 --> 01:41:43,890
She is so unfortunate, so fragile, so...

1847
01:41:44,480 --> 01:41:45,760
Helpless...

1848
01:41:47,220 --> 01:41:48,220
Helpless?

1849
01:41:48,300 --> 01:41:50,180
Does she look helpless to you?

1850
01:41:50,260 --> 01:41:52,680
Don't be fooled by my makeup, 
clothes, and eyelashes.

1851
01:41:53,090 --> 01:41:55,760
Hobbies and helplessness 
are two different things.

1852
01:41:56,590 --> 01:41:58,180
Don't cry, baby...

1853
01:41:58,340 --> 01:42:00,970
Sorry...whatever your name is.

1854
01:42:01,390 --> 01:42:03,090
- Kavya. 
- Kavya.

1855
01:42:03,720 --> 01:42:04,840
What a coincidence.

1856
01:42:04,970 --> 01:42:07,510
I have a liking for 
this name since childhood.

1857
01:42:07,760 --> 01:42:09,390
- Thanks. 
- Welcome.

1858
01:42:09,570 --> 01:42:13,640
So as I was saying, 
I came to London to perform in a show.

1859
01:42:14,680 --> 01:42:18,640
But my luck and the organiser's 
intentions were bad.

1860
01:42:19,680 --> 01:42:21,840
He wanted to make adult videos with me.

1861
01:42:21,930 --> 01:42:24,550
Sh** I hate these bas*** 
What happened next?

1862
01:42:24,640 --> 01:42:26,840
I hit him on the head 
with his camera and fled.

1863
01:42:26,930 --> 01:42:28,220
You did the right thing.

1864
01:42:29,550 --> 01:42:32,840
But I lost my passport, 
luggage, and money.

1865
01:42:33,080 --> 01:42:36,060
I was wandering alone, and starving.

1866
01:42:36,140 --> 01:42:39,260
- That's when I met that guy. 
- Where?

1867
01:42:41,020 --> 01:42:43,090
Who remembers the location 
in such a condition?

1868
01:42:43,680 --> 01:42:45,310
Stupid. What happened next?

1869
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:49,430
He brought me here and offered 
me the role of this ghost.

1870
01:42:49,510 --> 01:42:51,590
Why would anyone 
offer anyone such a job?

1871
01:42:52,050 --> 01:42:53,640
Do you think we're crazy?

1872
01:42:55,220 --> 01:42:56,510
Look, missy...

1873
01:42:57,080 --> 01:42:59,340
I never fainted for so long in my life.

1874
01:42:59,550 --> 01:43:00,510
Tell us the truth.

1875
01:43:02,010 --> 01:43:04,590
Tell us the truth right now, 
or else I'll call the Police...

1876
01:43:04,680 --> 01:43:05,840
Quiet.

1877
01:43:08,180 --> 01:43:09,510
I am with her.

1878
01:43:11,760 --> 01:43:15,510
Whether they believe 
your story or not, but I do.

1879
01:43:15,800 --> 01:43:16,930
Let's go baby.

1880
01:43:18,260 --> 01:43:21,930
I will hear your entire story, 
with the end credits.

1881
01:43:22,680 --> 01:43:23,760
Let's go, Kajal.

1882
01:43:23,840 --> 01:43:24,970
Kavya.

1883
01:43:25,180 --> 01:43:26,970
Oh yeah, Kavya.

1884
01:43:47,220 --> 01:43:48,710
Sir, greetings.

1885
01:43:48,840 --> 01:43:50,760
Its always good to see familiar 
faces during tough times.

1886
01:43:50,840 --> 01:43:53,680
He got a heart attack as 
soon as I asked for my money.

1887
01:43:53,760 --> 01:43:55,720
Your money's ready. 
Take it.

1888
01:43:56,430 --> 01:43:58,180
We had to pay you 14 billion pounds, 
didn't we...

1889
01:43:58,260 --> 01:43:59,640
He's made a cheque for 15 instead.

1890
01:43:59,720 --> 01:44:01,180
15 billion pounds.

1891
01:44:02,260 --> 01:44:04,720
Wait a minute. 
Who is Raj?

1892
01:44:04,970 --> 01:44:05,890
Our servant.

1893
01:44:06,010 --> 01:44:08,050
So does your servant 
sign your cheques these days?

1894
01:44:08,140 --> 01:44:10,170
No, no, brother-in-law does.

1895
01:44:10,510 --> 01:44:14,140
Actually, he got a heart attack 
before he could finish writing Raja.

1896
01:44:14,220 --> 01:44:15,340
So what now?

1897
01:44:15,430 --> 01:44:17,010
Great news from a weak stomach.

1898
01:44:17,400 --> 01:44:19,800
- Raja sir is awake. 
- Come on. Hurry up.

1899
01:44:20,720 --> 01:44:21,680
Come.

1900
01:44:24,470 --> 01:44:26,180
Put up a good performance, 
brother-in-law.

1901
01:44:27,220 --> 01:44:28,720
- Saying hello. 
- Yes.

1902
01:44:29,220 --> 01:44:30,340
You will be okay.

1903
01:44:30,430 --> 01:44:31,720
What is he saying?

1904
01:44:31,800 --> 01:44:33,590
Wouldn't you have heard 
if he was saying anything?

1905
01:44:33,680 --> 01:44:36,590
Then what is he trying 
to say with his gestures?

1906
01:44:36,720 --> 01:44:39,180
He's worried about signing the cheque.

1907
01:44:40,340 --> 01:44:42,090
- He's asking for a pen. 
- Here you go.

1908
01:44:44,080 --> 01:44:45,840
He's asking for a writing pen.

1909
01:44:46,280 --> 01:44:48,470
This is the only pen I know. 
What else?

1910
01:44:48,970 --> 01:44:49,900
Use mine.

1911
01:44:51,470 --> 01:44:53,090
- Cheque. 
- Here you go.

1912
01:44:53,420 --> 01:44:54,460
Thank you.

1913
01:44:55,430 --> 01:44:56,990
Hold it properly.

1914
01:45:00,770 --> 01:45:02,010
- Easy brother-in-law. 
- A...

1915
01:45:02,680 --> 01:45:03,720
A...

1916
01:45:04,470 --> 01:45:05,720
A...

1917
01:45:07,260 --> 01:45:08,090
Sir!

1918
01:45:09,300 --> 01:45:10,470
- What happened now? 
- Doctor!

1919
01:45:10,800 --> 01:45:12,510
[islamic prayer]

1920
01:45:12,590 --> 01:45:14,060
He's only unconscious.

1921
01:45:14,140 --> 01:45:15,720
[islamic prayer]

1922
01:45:16,600 --> 01:45:18,050
When will he come to?

1923
01:45:18,140 --> 01:45:19,840
Whether he comes around or not...

1924
01:45:20,140 --> 01:45:22,300
...but my money should come back to me.

1925
01:45:22,800 --> 01:45:25,760
Otherwise when I am through 
with his dead body...

1926
01:45:25,840 --> 01:45:28,590
...even the scavengers wouldn't 
want to go anywhere near him.

1927
01:45:32,760 --> 01:45:36,300
- Congratulations. Congratulations. 
- Raja sir is awake again.

1928
01:45:36,520 --> 01:45:37,810
- Come on. Let's go. 
- Come, come.

1929
01:45:37,890 --> 01:45:40,200
It's the sixth time since morning.

1930
01:45:40,280 --> 01:45:42,620
- Come on. 
- Hurry up.

1931
01:45:43,220 --> 01:45:44,330
Take it.

1932
01:45:46,340 --> 01:45:47,720
Was he a dancer?

1933
01:45:48,310 --> 01:45:49,990
What is he saying now?

1934
01:45:50,070 --> 01:45:52,210
He's saying whose pen should he use?

1935
01:45:52,370 --> 01:45:54,100
Use anyone, but just do it.

1936
01:45:54,250 --> 01:45:56,800
He is doing. Let him select first.

1937
01:45:56,880 --> 01:45:58,390
- Here. 
- Yes.

1938
01:46:01,170 --> 01:46:02,300
What is this?

1939
01:46:02,390 --> 01:46:04,970
He needs something to 
keep the cheque on and sign.

1940
01:46:05,050 --> 01:46:05,930
Give him that.

1941
01:46:06,010 --> 01:46:07,360
Take this.

1942
01:46:08,490 --> 01:46:09,720
A...

1943
01:46:09,870 --> 01:46:11,050
Aalifh.

1944
01:46:12,510 --> 01:46:13,340
Aalif?

1945
01:46:13,430 --> 01:46:14,340
Just write!

1946
01:46:15,390 --> 01:46:16,590
Brother-in-law!

1947
01:46:17,260 --> 01:46:20,180
What kind of illness is this...

1948
01:46:20,260 --> 01:46:22,300
...where he faints 
as soon as he holds a pen.

1949
01:46:22,390 --> 01:46:24,720
We're all stuck on this "A".

1950
01:46:24,800 --> 01:46:27,220
How long does it take to write "A"?

1951
01:46:27,300 --> 01:46:29,190
- One year? 
- One year?

1952
01:46:29,270 --> 01:46:32,050
I mean it takes even a kid one year 
before he can learn to write "A".

1953
01:46:32,130 --> 01:46:34,390
Once he learns to write A he 
automatically learns to write till Z.

1954
01:46:34,470 --> 01:46:35,790
- A to Z. 
- Excuse me, sir.

1955
01:46:36,550 --> 01:46:38,260
You need to clear this bill first...

1956
01:46:38,530 --> 01:46:40,760
...So we can start 
with further treatment.

1957
01:46:41,760 --> 01:46:42,760
10,000 pounds.

1958
01:46:43,340 --> 01:46:45,550
Modi Sir, please clear the bill.

1959
01:46:46,470 --> 01:46:48,760
- Me? 
- Our money is in the bank.

1960
01:46:48,890 --> 01:46:49,930
And brother-in-law...

1961
01:46:50,180 --> 01:46:53,590
When he wakes up and shrugs 
his shirt it will rain money.

1962
01:46:53,760 --> 01:46:56,390
And anyway, we've paid you 
1 billion extra. We'll adjust.

1963
01:46:56,470 --> 01:46:59,090
Mark my words. 
you'll have to pay us back.

1964
01:46:59,180 --> 01:47:02,840
My money, 
my pen, and I've to pay the bill.

1965
01:47:03,510 --> 01:47:05,510
- Keep some advance also, madam. 
- Thank you.

1966
01:47:06,190 --> 01:47:09,200
Modi Sir, what if he's 
trying to get more money out...

1967
01:47:09,280 --> 01:47:11,340
...of you showing his incomplete cheque?

1968
01:47:11,800 --> 01:47:14,340
Come on, let's go check at the bank.

1969
01:47:14,590 --> 01:47:17,390
I am sorry. 
This cheque cannot be encashed.

1970
01:47:17,470 --> 01:47:18,550
See!

1971
01:47:20,540 --> 01:47:23,340
I mean...the signature isn't complete.

1972
01:47:23,760 --> 01:47:24,810
Where's the A?

1973
01:47:24,940 --> 01:47:26,260
Oh, God.

1974
01:47:26,760 --> 01:47:28,390
Does he have money in the account?

1975
01:47:28,760 --> 01:47:29,930
I am sorry, sir, but...

1976
01:47:30,010 --> 01:47:31,720
Mister can you at least tell us...

1977
01:47:31,800 --> 01:47:34,390
...whether this cheque 
can be encashed if we get the A?

1978
01:47:34,550 --> 01:47:35,590
One minute, sir.

1979
01:47:42,470 --> 01:47:44,340
You can encash 50 
cheques like this, sir.

1980
01:47:46,430 --> 01:47:47,550
- Thank you. 
- You are welcome.

1981
01:47:47,790 --> 01:47:48,550
Excuse me, sir.

1982
01:47:49,470 --> 01:47:53,590
Please don't come anywhere 
near our bank again.

1983
01:47:54,180 --> 01:47:57,550
Or else our plight might 
become the same as Indias.

1984
01:47:59,340 --> 01:48:01,540
- Is it loaded? 
- No, sir.

1985
01:48:09,430 --> 01:48:10,300
WiFi sir...

1986
01:48:11,190 --> 01:48:12,090
My son.

1987
01:48:12,340 --> 01:48:14,800
I am looking to adopt him. 
He'll be delivered to your home.

1988
01:48:14,880 --> 01:48:17,550
Sir...there isn't even 
minimum balance in your account.

1989
01:48:17,810 --> 01:48:20,190
Deposit some money or else 
we'll have to terminate your account.

1990
01:48:21,220 --> 01:48:22,640
- Here's a suggestion... 
- Yes.

1991
01:48:22,720 --> 01:48:27,180
Maintain our minimum balance from 
your salary for the sake of your child.

1992
01:48:27,470 --> 01:48:29,430
So he can be always happy.

1993
01:48:33,260 --> 01:48:36,990
From breakfast, we've moved to lunch. 
But that scallywag hasn't come out yet.

1994
01:48:56,940 --> 01:48:58,140
Are you hungry?

1995
01:49:03,680 --> 01:49:04,760
Want to eat.

1996
01:49:15,930 --> 01:49:17,090
Uncle...

1997
01:49:17,540 --> 01:49:20,890
I've still on base 1...and 
he's graduated to homerun.

1998
01:49:21,340 --> 01:49:24,800
Sometimes, 
luck finds you behind closed doors.

1999
01:49:26,510 --> 01:49:27,760
What are they doing?

2000
01:49:29,300 --> 01:49:32,340
It's neither a big deal or a bad one.

2001
01:49:33,300 --> 01:49:35,490
We can do it too. 
Look...

2002
01:49:36,430 --> 01:49:38,890
Keep your lips on the cheek like this...

2003
01:49:39,460 --> 01:49:42,470
...and it slips to the 
right place automatically.

2004
01:49:43,910 --> 01:49:45,300
It's called a kiss.

2005
01:49:45,470 --> 01:49:49,430
But papa says that girls 
get pregnant when they kiss.

2006
01:49:50,430 --> 01:49:53,510
Your father is crazy... 
to call this love a sin.

2007
01:49:53,590 --> 01:49:56,300
There is no problem in doing it. 
Let me show you.

2008
01:49:59,050 --> 01:50:00,510
Papa. I am not going to pregnant...

2009
01:50:00,590 --> 01:50:01,970
- No.. Stop. 
- Listen.

2010
01:50:03,550 --> 01:50:07,640
There was a time when someone 
left a lipstick mark on me as well.

2011
01:50:16,850 --> 01:50:17,810
Raj.

2012
01:50:18,300 --> 01:50:19,980
Sanjana, baby doll.

2013
01:50:21,390 --> 01:50:22,220
Rascal.

2014
01:50:22,300 --> 01:50:23,390
Sanjana.

2015
01:50:23,470 --> 01:50:24,510
Sanjana.

2016
01:50:25,730 --> 01:50:26,390
Sanjana.

2017
01:50:26,470 --> 01:50:27,510
Sanjana.

2018
01:50:27,590 --> 01:50:29,510
You're the only property I've.

2019
01:50:29,590 --> 01:50:31,180
And he wants to take over that as well

2020
01:50:31,300 --> 01:50:32,340
Stop.

2021
01:50:40,390 --> 01:50:43,960
You'll get your kiss only 
when you return our money.

2022
01:51:14,340 --> 01:51:17,550
Uncle, I already invested 
half of the money in property.

2023
01:51:17,640 --> 01:51:19,390
Invest the rest as well.

2024
01:51:19,470 --> 01:51:22,590
Otherwise, how will we make profits? 
Go ahead.

2025
01:51:26,010 --> 01:51:28,120
Niraj Modi is just a tag...

2026
01:51:28,200 --> 01:51:30,920
This is a result of his bad luck

2027
01:51:35,220 --> 01:51:38,510
Modi's grown suspicious. He's 
bringing his entire team of doctors.

2028
01:51:38,590 --> 01:51:40,980
Brother-in-law, 
I think your performance fell short.

2029
01:51:41,060 --> 01:51:42,920
What performance fell short?

2030
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:44,220
I am fainting at the right moment...

2031
01:51:44,300 --> 01:51:45,840
...then dropping the 
pen at the right moment.

2032
01:51:46,380 --> 01:51:48,540
Should I wake up now?

2033
01:51:48,620 --> 01:51:50,950
They will put us to sleep permanently.

2034
01:51:51,350 --> 01:51:52,720
We're in the wrong profession.

2035
01:51:53,050 --> 01:51:55,740
I wish we were farmers, then at 
least our loan would've been waived off.

2036
01:51:55,820 --> 01:51:57,970
I have an idea. 
Let's change the scene.

2037
01:51:58,390 --> 01:51:59,470
Scene no. 2.

2038
01:52:00,330 --> 01:52:01,140
- Done. 
- Done.

2039
01:52:10,140 --> 01:52:13,760
Ramu, you brought rotten mangoes again.

2040
01:52:13,840 --> 01:52:15,680
Brother-in-law's lost his memory.

2041
01:52:16,050 --> 01:52:20,510
- Our gardener looked just like you, so... 
- Madhav.

2042
01:52:20,590 --> 01:52:23,220
How are you, son? 
Kishu...

2043
01:52:23,680 --> 01:52:24,840
Listen, Madhav.

2044
01:52:24,920 --> 01:52:27,260
Didn't your girl run away with his lad?

2045
01:52:27,340 --> 01:52:29,680
Did your girl and boy come back?

2046
01:52:29,760 --> 01:52:32,430
You two aren't even married...

2047
01:52:32,510 --> 01:52:33,930
...and he's already 
making your children elope.

2048
01:52:34,010 --> 01:52:36,760
Uncle, don't you dare intervene.

2049
01:52:36,960 --> 01:52:39,640
- Or else I'll tell them aunty's secrets... 
- Brother-in-law.

2050
01:52:39,720 --> 01:52:41,010
God!

2051
01:52:41,090 --> 01:52:42,590
Great...

2052
01:52:44,970 --> 01:52:47,840
No doctor in the world can 
detect what's wrong with the brain.

2053
01:52:47,970 --> 01:52:48,970
Right, Tulli bro?

2054
01:52:49,140 --> 01:52:51,430
Yes, Bulli bro. 
Let's blow his brains out...

2055
01:52:51,510 --> 01:52:53,220
...then we can check ourselves.

2056
01:52:53,510 --> 01:52:57,090
You can't blow my brains out 
because I have the bullets.

2057
01:52:57,180 --> 01:52:59,430
Allow me to jog his memory.

2058
01:53:01,010 --> 01:53:04,430
Your boys didn't bet the money on Lucky.

2059
01:53:05,430 --> 01:53:09,080
We made our men give them the wrong tip.

2060
01:53:14,300 --> 01:53:16,280
Would you like a lollypop?

2061
01:53:18,560 --> 01:53:21,560
There's a fire... 
Run, brother-in-law.

2062
01:53:22,510 --> 01:53:24,400
- Fire in the hospital. 
- How did it catch fire?

2063
01:53:24,550 --> 01:53:26,600
Why fire sprinklers is not working?

2064
01:53:28,320 --> 01:53:29,760
Where are you, sir?

2065
01:53:29,840 --> 01:53:31,910
Run, sir. Come.

2066
01:53:32,840 --> 01:53:35,390
Hey, WiFi!

2067
01:53:35,800 --> 01:53:39,340
Where did you go leaving me alone?

2068
01:53:40,720 --> 01:53:41,760
Welcome.

2069
01:53:47,850 --> 01:53:51,420
The fire's not raging in the hospital, 
it's here.

2070
01:53:52,510 --> 01:53:54,140
He loves to shrug his sweater, 
doesn't he?

2071
01:53:54,840 --> 01:53:56,000
Now strip him of his underwear.

2072
01:53:56,080 --> 01:53:58,090
Easy, easy..

2073
01:53:58,170 --> 01:54:00,080
Don't kill us.

2074
01:54:00,170 --> 01:54:01,510
Don't kill us.

2075
01:54:01,970 --> 01:54:03,960
I am very innocent and naive.

2076
01:54:04,400 --> 01:54:05,490
When he said he's having an attack...

2077
01:54:05,570 --> 01:54:06,900
...I really thought he's 
having a heart attack.

2078
01:54:07,150 --> 01:54:10,490
He said he's lost his memory, and 
I thought he's really lost his memory.

2079
01:54:10,970 --> 01:54:13,490
He fooled me like he 
fooled the rest of you.

2080
01:54:13,570 --> 01:54:15,100
I am like your son.

2081
01:54:15,180 --> 01:54:18,400
Would you like to shed some 
light on this issue, Raja sir?

2082
01:54:18,570 --> 01:54:20,240
It was his idea.

2083
01:54:20,530 --> 01:54:24,200
He told me making a fool 
out of you is not a big deal.

2084
01:54:24,280 --> 01:54:25,830
He was right. 
We fooled all of them.

2085
01:54:25,910 --> 01:54:27,460
These bloody...

2086
01:54:28,480 --> 01:54:31,280
Did the chandelier that fell 
on your head crack your skull?

2087
01:54:31,360 --> 01:54:32,610
We'll fix it.

2088
01:54:32,800 --> 01:54:36,280
We've all the arrangements 
to jog your memory.

2089
01:54:36,400 --> 01:54:39,150
And when we're through with you...

2090
01:54:39,230 --> 01:54:43,320
...you'll look like you're 
doing disco lying on the floor.

2091
01:54:43,490 --> 01:54:44,990
Mercy, Modi sir. Mercy.

2092
01:54:45,500 --> 01:54:49,820
We can do the disco 
for you without the torture.

2093
01:54:49,900 --> 01:54:51,070
Look.

2094
01:54:51,150 --> 01:54:53,400
"I am a disco dancer"

2095
01:54:54,470 --> 01:54:56,230
Just give us a little more time.

2096
01:54:56,310 --> 01:54:59,940
I'll return every 
penny I owe you, I swear.

2097
01:55:00,020 --> 01:55:02,070
I want all my money back.

2098
01:55:02,150 --> 01:55:04,070
And who will lend 
you that kind of money?

2099
01:55:04,150 --> 01:55:06,900
My beggar king... 
Who will help you? Tell me.

2100
01:55:29,990 --> 01:55:32,490
Papa. Papa. Papa. Papa.

2101
01:55:32,570 --> 01:55:34,570
Papa. Papa.

2102
01:55:35,150 --> 01:55:36,570
No one will harm them?

2103
01:55:37,740 --> 01:55:38,530
Is it loaded?

2104
01:55:38,650 --> 01:55:39,820
Mine is.

2105
01:55:40,280 --> 01:55:41,570
You want money, don't you?

2106
01:55:42,350 --> 01:55:45,240
Then take your money with interest, 
right now.

2107
01:55:46,110 --> 01:55:49,700
Dollar, Euro, 
Pound, Indian Rupee, what do you prefer?

2108
01:55:50,370 --> 01:55:51,990
- Girlfriend? 
- What do we care?

2109
01:55:52,070 --> 01:55:54,280
First, we called out 
the master's on their bluff...

2110
01:55:54,700 --> 01:55:56,860
...now the servants 
are playing games with us.

2111
01:55:56,950 --> 01:55:59,150
- Right, Tulli bro? 
- Yes, Bulli bro.

2112
01:55:59,240 --> 01:56:01,320
Do you have money to 
pay rent of the cars...

2113
01:56:01,400 --> 01:56:05,150
...or are you going 
to beg to Modi sir as well

2114
01:56:06,700 --> 01:56:08,230
Uncle...

2115
01:56:08,700 --> 01:56:09,860
Give them the money.

2116
01:56:09,940 --> 01:56:11,280
It's a big amount.

2117
01:56:11,450 --> 01:56:12,740
Send your men to the car.

2118
01:56:13,780 --> 01:56:15,740
Come on, guys. Quick.

2119
01:56:16,320 --> 01:56:18,150
- Keep all the money here. 
- Keep?

2120
01:56:19,450 --> 01:56:23,540
Mafia uncles, these people 
burned more money than you ever earned.

2121
01:56:24,360 --> 01:56:25,400
She will get us killed?

2122
01:56:29,360 --> 01:56:31,320
- Tulli bro? 
- Yes, Bulli bro.

2123
01:56:32,610 --> 01:56:34,990
- Are they... 
- Real.

2124
01:56:35,700 --> 01:56:38,700
We didn't count but must 
be a few million extras.

2125
01:56:38,780 --> 01:56:41,070
We didn't bring the machine, 
how are we going to count them?

2126
01:56:41,150 --> 01:56:42,400
No need.

2127
01:56:42,700 --> 01:56:44,990
My eyes are the currency 
counting machine.

2128
01:56:45,360 --> 01:56:48,860
Even if I look at money, it 
automatically reveals to me the figure.

2129
01:56:48,950 --> 01:56:49,990
All here?

2130
01:56:50,070 --> 01:56:51,160
All there.

2131
01:56:51,240 --> 01:56:53,490
Okay then, great. 
Are you two coming or waiting?

2132
01:56:53,570 --> 01:56:55,280
- Yes, yes. Let's go. 
- Come, come.

2133
01:56:55,360 --> 01:56:57,030
- Chandu baby let's go. 
- Follow me. - WiFi...

2134
01:56:57,110 --> 01:56:58,990
Brother-in-law. 
Don't leave me alone.

2135
01:56:59,070 --> 01:57:01,110
See Raja sir, this is a reality.

2136
01:57:01,240 --> 01:57:02,990
When you run out of money...

2137
01:57:03,070 --> 01:57:05,480
...it's the relatives that 
turn their back on you first.

2138
01:57:05,560 --> 01:57:07,080
Amazing.

2139
01:57:07,400 --> 01:57:08,570
That was really something, wasn't it?

2140
01:57:08,650 --> 01:57:10,150
Yeah, but how do you think of it?

2141
01:57:10,310 --> 01:57:11,950
I mean it just comes automatically.

2142
01:57:13,400 --> 01:57:15,780
I know that the date 
changes every day...

2143
01:57:16,980 --> 01:57:21,160
...but there comes a 
date when your day changes.

2144
01:57:28,280 --> 01:57:30,700
How did they get hold of so much money?

2145
01:57:32,740 --> 01:57:35,410
Did you use all the 
money to bail us out, or...

2146
01:57:35,490 --> 01:57:36,740
No, no.

2147
01:57:36,950 --> 01:57:38,650
We used just a small share. That's all.

2148
01:57:38,740 --> 01:57:40,910
We're going to invest 
the rest in the business.

2149
01:57:40,990 --> 01:57:43,920
Eiffel Tower, 
Taj Mahal, Statue of Liberty.

2150
01:57:44,150 --> 01:57:45,240
We've made an offer for all of them.

2151
01:57:45,450 --> 01:57:47,360
All this is government property.

2152
01:57:47,530 --> 01:57:50,250
You'll squander money and 
yet get your hands on nothing.

2153
01:57:50,330 --> 01:57:52,950
We'll tell you what 
to buy from whom and when.

2154
01:57:53,170 --> 01:57:54,450
Make us your partners.

2155
01:57:54,530 --> 01:57:57,280
No, no, no... 
we can't make you partners.

2156
01:57:57,570 --> 01:57:58,410
But why?

2157
01:57:58,490 --> 01:58:00,240
Because we're white-collar people...

2158
01:58:00,700 --> 01:58:02,110
...and you guys are criminals.

2159
01:58:03,200 --> 01:58:05,410
Please help papa and uncle.

2160
01:58:05,490 --> 01:58:06,650
Can you guys mop the floor?

2161
01:58:08,880 --> 01:58:09,320
Good.

2162
01:58:09,400 --> 01:58:10,580
Start from that room.

2163
01:58:10,660 --> 01:58:12,450
Okay, follow me.

2164
01:58:12,740 --> 01:58:14,950
- Junky. 
- I am just kidding.

2165
01:58:16,900 --> 01:58:18,870
We want to buy properties.

2166
01:58:18,950 --> 01:58:21,870
Why don't you guys get it for us? 
And we'll give you a 10% commission.

2167
01:58:22,200 --> 01:58:26,320
If you get us properties 
worth 100 billion or more.

2168
01:58:26,780 --> 01:58:29,070
Then even you make 10 billion.

2169
01:58:29,150 --> 01:58:31,530
- Done! Done! 
- Good.

2170
01:58:31,610 --> 01:58:33,580
What done?

2171
01:58:33,900 --> 01:58:37,610
You mean from Dons we'll 
become brokers for their sake.

2172
01:58:37,780 --> 01:58:40,570
You two are already broke. 
There's no shame in being a broker.

2173
01:58:40,790 --> 01:58:43,900
Let's come up with a better name then.

2174
01:58:44,240 --> 01:58:48,650
Like financial advisor. 
Chartered accounted.

2175
01:58:49,740 --> 01:58:50,990
Then arrange for a grand party.

2176
01:58:52,240 --> 01:58:54,120
And invite all the 
rich people in the city.

2177
01:58:54,200 --> 01:58:57,350
They should know that three rich 
businessmen have arrived in their city.

2178
01:59:07,990 --> 01:59:11,480
"Let me tell you a story 
about a girl from UP."

2179
01:59:11,560 --> 01:59:15,070
"I prefer girls more down to earth 
but she was drop-dead gorgeous."

2180
01:59:15,360 --> 01:59:18,860
"Let me tell you a story 
about a girl from UP."

2181
01:59:18,950 --> 01:59:22,320
"I prefer girls more down to earth 
but she was drop-dead gorgeous."

2182
01:59:22,400 --> 01:59:26,160
"Her curvaceous body 
now I am addicted to her."

2183
01:59:26,240 --> 01:59:29,700
"I was shocked 
when I saw her..."

2184
01:59:29,780 --> 01:59:30,490
"What?"

2185
01:59:30,570 --> 01:59:34,070
"Sway her hips."

2186
01:59:34,150 --> 01:59:37,320
"Sway her hips."

2187
01:59:38,070 --> 01:59:41,150
"The way you... 
Sway her hips."

2188
01:59:41,310 --> 01:59:44,900
"Sway her hips."

2189
01:59:45,480 --> 01:59:48,860
Modi sir, we like your hotel.

2190
01:59:49,190 --> 01:59:50,740
Do you know the price?

2191
01:59:50,990 --> 01:59:53,000
Can't be more than my shirt's sleeve?

2192
01:59:53,080 --> 01:59:56,070
"Sway her hips."

2193
01:59:56,750 --> 01:59:59,940
"Sway her hips."

2194
02:00:00,340 --> 02:00:03,990
"I'll convince your father 
lay siege on your home."

2195
02:00:04,070 --> 02:00:07,740
"Give me your permission 
and I'll abduct you from your home."

2196
02:00:07,820 --> 02:00:11,500
"I'll convince your father 
lay siege on your home."

2197
02:00:11,580 --> 02:00:15,380
"Give me your permission 
and I'll abduct you from your home."

2198
02:00:15,530 --> 02:00:18,660
"Sway her hips."

2199
02:00:18,740 --> 02:00:22,360
"The way you... 
Sway her hips."

2200
02:00:22,540 --> 02:00:26,200
"Sway her hips."

2201
02:00:29,800 --> 02:00:32,110
Your hotel and your resort...

2202
02:00:32,700 --> 02:00:34,610
...now belong to us.

2203
02:00:34,780 --> 02:00:37,320
- "Sway her hips." 
- Cheers!

2204
02:00:37,780 --> 02:00:41,450
"The way you sway 
your hips gets me high."

2205
02:00:41,530 --> 02:00:45,220
"...I chucked all your 
lovers in the river."

2206
02:00:45,300 --> 02:00:49,000
"The way you sway 
your hips gets me high."

2207
02:00:49,080 --> 02:00:52,530
"...I chucked all your 
lovers in the river."

2208
02:00:52,610 --> 02:00:55,530
"You've started a riot in my state."

2209
02:00:55,610 --> 02:00:59,320
"Now the entire state is in chaos."

2210
02:00:59,400 --> 02:01:00,400
"Watching you..."

2211
02:01:00,530 --> 02:01:03,570
"Sway her hips."

2212
02:01:03,650 --> 02:01:07,350
"The way you... 
Sway her hips."

2213
02:01:07,550 --> 02:01:11,200
"Sway her hips."

2214
02:01:19,290 --> 02:01:22,440
"Sway her hips."

2215
02:01:23,020 --> 02:01:26,070
"Sway her hips."

2216
02:01:26,790 --> 02:01:28,160
"You're so naive..."

2217
02:01:28,420 --> 02:01:29,780
"And I am crafty..."

2218
02:01:30,250 --> 02:01:33,490
"I'll abduct you from your home."

2219
02:01:33,570 --> 02:01:34,150
"You naive..."

2220
02:01:34,240 --> 02:01:35,740
"You're so naive..."

2221
02:01:35,990 --> 02:01:37,820
"And I am crafty..."

2222
02:01:37,900 --> 02:01:40,990
"I'll abduct you from your home."

2223
02:01:41,070 --> 02:01:42,360
"You naive..."

2224
02:01:42,440 --> 02:01:44,000
"Sway her hips."

2225
02:01:49,700 --> 02:01:50,650
I am dead!

2226
02:01:51,990 --> 02:01:53,650
Where is my money?

2227
02:01:58,070 --> 02:02:00,310
I am ruined.

2228
02:02:05,400 --> 02:02:07,760
They left nothing.

2229
02:02:10,570 --> 02:02:12,240
Anybody there.

2230
02:02:12,320 --> 02:02:13,610
Uncle.

2231
02:02:14,240 --> 02:02:16,110
What are you saying, Niraj?

2232
02:02:16,300 --> 02:02:18,360
You'll give me a heart attack!

2233
02:02:18,740 --> 02:02:21,070
Where did our money go?

2234
02:02:21,530 --> 02:02:22,950
Who can do such a thing?

2235
02:02:23,690 --> 02:02:26,610
'What treasure did you find? 
Tell me?'

2236
02:02:26,700 --> 02:02:28,990
'You can say that 
we found your treasure.'

2237
02:02:31,240 --> 02:02:34,200
Niraj, why don't you say something?

2238
02:02:34,560 --> 02:02:36,700
Did you get a heart attack instead?

2239
02:02:37,280 --> 02:02:43,550
No, uncle. But the one who attacked 
me will now get a heart attack.

2240
02:02:45,780 --> 02:02:47,650
I will ruin them.

2241
02:02:51,190 --> 02:02:53,030
I won't spare anyone, uncle.

2242
02:03:04,780 --> 02:03:06,320
What's wrong with them?

2243
02:03:07,400 --> 02:03:10,400
We even sold their property 
which they didn't own.

2244
02:03:10,480 --> 02:03:13,780
First, they showered flowers on 
us and now they are showering bullets.

2245
02:03:25,880 --> 02:03:29,800
Come out otherwise 
I'll blow up this entire place.

2246
02:03:30,240 --> 02:03:31,900
Come out, you two brothers-in-law.

2247
02:03:33,030 --> 02:03:34,240
Let's chat.

2248
02:03:35,360 --> 02:03:36,490
Come out, everyone.

2249
02:03:47,860 --> 02:03:51,370
Niraj...what crime did we commit now?

2250
02:03:51,450 --> 02:03:52,400
Crime...

2251
02:03:52,740 --> 02:03:55,780
I didn't know you 
were such crafty buggers?

2252
02:03:55,860 --> 02:03:57,150
Crafty?

2253
02:03:57,490 --> 02:03:58,410
Buggers?

2254
02:03:58,490 --> 02:03:59,250
Where are they?

2255
02:03:59,330 --> 02:04:01,740
Where are your three tamed donkeys?

2256
02:04:01,890 --> 02:04:05,150
Donkeys? But we don't keep donkeys. 
We only keep horses.

2257
02:04:05,240 --> 02:04:10,530
He means those three clowns. 
Your servants.

2258
02:04:10,610 --> 02:04:12,200
They are no longer our servants.

2259
02:04:12,360 --> 02:04:16,740
Since they found the treasure, 
they have become our bosses.

2260
02:04:16,820 --> 02:04:17,740
Boss.

2261
02:04:17,960 --> 02:04:22,700
Do you know what treasure those 
rascals found? Do you have any clue?

2262
02:04:22,780 --> 02:04:25,680
If we knew, 
wouldn't we have looted it before them?

2263
02:04:25,760 --> 02:04:28,640
Must be of some Ali Baba's treasure. 
We don't care.

2264
02:04:29,240 --> 02:04:32,230
That Ali Baba is me.

2265
02:04:36,850 --> 02:04:38,670
That's my treasure.

2266
02:04:40,360 --> 02:04:43,110
What cave did you hide your treasure...

2267
02:04:43,200 --> 02:04:44,620
...that they found it so easily?

2268
02:04:44,700 --> 02:04:46,400
It was stashed in his secret bungalow.

2269
02:04:48,360 --> 02:04:53,200
Those rascals used his money 
to buy his property and ruined him.

2270
02:04:54,490 --> 02:04:59,110
He even sold our 
property along with his.

2271
02:05:00,030 --> 02:05:02,240
He assured he will take care of it...

2272
02:05:02,320 --> 02:05:06,280
...and even kept our 
entire money in his treasure.

2273
02:05:06,450 --> 02:05:12,240
Those rascals are not capable 
of such a devious plan alone.

2274
02:05:13,110 --> 02:05:15,240
You two must have trained them.

2275
02:05:15,730 --> 02:05:19,530
Baba Jani, we used to be Dons.

2276
02:05:20,290 --> 02:05:21,490
God father.

2277
02:05:21,870 --> 02:05:23,890
But we're reduced to Brokers now. 
Agents.

2278
02:05:25,490 --> 02:05:26,700
Rascals...

2279
02:05:26,970 --> 02:05:29,170
I loot and plunder the world...

2280
02:05:29,530 --> 02:05:31,490
...but you two looted me.

2281
02:05:31,930 --> 02:05:34,320
Together you made my plight so bad...

2282
02:05:34,400 --> 02:05:36,160
...which I couldn't even do with India.

2283
02:05:36,240 --> 02:05:37,740
This is not your fault.

2284
02:05:37,910 --> 02:05:42,200
You see, those three fooled 
us along with all of you.

2285
02:05:42,280 --> 02:05:48,490
Fine, I want all my money, with 
property papers, and those three alive.

2286
02:05:48,570 --> 02:05:51,320
Along with their girlfriends.

2287
02:05:51,400 --> 02:05:53,280
Modi Sir, excuse me.

2288
02:05:53,700 --> 02:05:55,650
Do you believe in the stars?

2289
02:05:55,740 --> 02:05:57,280
Yes, we do.

2290
02:05:57,360 --> 02:05:58,560
Very good.

2291
02:05:58,640 --> 02:06:00,860
Then please don't call them here.

2292
02:06:01,110 --> 02:06:03,110
Because if they come here, then...

2293
02:06:03,610 --> 02:06:04,740
Don't be scared. Say it.

2294
02:06:04,820 --> 02:06:07,570
If they come here, you'll get defaced.

2295
02:06:09,490 --> 02:06:10,280
Is it loaded?

2296
02:06:11,730 --> 02:06:12,740
It's loaded.

2297
02:06:13,490 --> 02:06:14,150
Sorry, sir.

2298
02:06:14,300 --> 02:06:16,570
WiFi, let's go.

2299
02:06:16,650 --> 02:06:18,400
Let's go and bring those three here.

2300
02:06:18,490 --> 02:06:19,610
Yes, which car, brother-in-law?

2301
02:06:19,700 --> 02:06:22,530
I'll go on foot! Let's go.

2302
02:06:23,390 --> 02:06:26,950
It will take you a long 
time to walk with a crippled leg.

2303
02:06:27,740 --> 02:06:28,780
You stay here.

2304
02:06:30,650 --> 02:06:32,070
You'll go alone.

2305
02:06:32,280 --> 02:06:35,650
You have one hour, 
and you know where to go. Don't you?

2306
02:06:36,200 --> 02:06:36,860
Yes.

2307
02:06:36,950 --> 02:06:39,320
Your time starts now.

2308
02:06:39,400 --> 02:06:41,740
Don't worry, brother-in-law. 
Don't worry.

2309
02:06:42,180 --> 02:06:45,820
I'll go like the wind, 
and return like a storm.

2310
02:06:55,030 --> 02:06:56,950
Hey, three idiots.

2311
02:06:57,660 --> 02:06:59,820
Where is everyone hiding?

2312
02:07:01,950 --> 02:07:06,240
The treasure you guys looted, 
do you know who it belongs to?

2313
02:07:07,370 --> 02:07:08,570
Niraj Modi.

2314
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:12,070
And do you know who he is?

2315
02:07:12,150 --> 02:07:14,650
He is a thief. A dacoit.

2316
02:07:15,260 --> 02:07:16,490
Traitor and a turncoat.

2317
02:07:17,200 --> 02:07:20,200
He stole the hard-earned 
money of millions of Indians...

2318
02:07:20,280 --> 02:07:22,240
...and hiding out here.

2319
02:07:24,710 --> 02:07:28,240
Raj used to work in the 
bank where he stole money from.

2320
02:07:28,780 --> 02:07:30,990
Even he lost his job like many others.

2321
02:07:31,070 --> 02:07:32,490
Many were jailed.

2322
02:07:32,780 --> 02:07:36,030
Some of them even committed suicide.

2323
02:07:37,780 --> 02:07:39,500
The day I saw him...

2324
02:07:41,350 --> 02:07:43,510
I wanted to strangle him that day.

2325
02:07:44,030 --> 02:07:47,070
So none of this was unintentional.

2326
02:07:47,280 --> 02:07:49,530
- You were... 
- We planned everything.

2327
02:07:50,650 --> 02:07:54,650
The money doesn't belong to him, 
It belongs to India.

2328
02:07:54,950 --> 02:07:59,570
That's why we bought all 
his property with your help.

2329
02:07:59,780 --> 02:08:03,360
So we can take him back 
to India along with the money.

2330
02:08:03,440 --> 02:08:08,070
But before that, he will kill 
all of you, me, and brother-in-law.

2331
02:08:08,150 --> 02:08:09,990
We're not worried about our lives.

2332
02:08:11,610 --> 02:08:14,610
We won't regret if we 
sacrifice it for our country.

2333
02:08:14,950 --> 02:08:17,280
And as for Raja sir and WiFi...

2334
02:08:17,700 --> 02:08:19,320
You two would've died anyway...

2335
02:08:20,150 --> 02:08:23,030
...if this money 
hadn't saved your lives.

2336
02:08:23,190 --> 02:08:25,280
You can forget your country, WiFi sir.

2337
02:08:25,700 --> 02:08:28,280
But your country never forgot you.

2338
02:08:30,030 --> 02:08:34,150
You owe every breath to your country.

2339
02:08:34,310 --> 02:08:36,400
I don't care about any country.

2340
02:08:37,070 --> 02:08:38,950
The country that failed me.

2341
02:08:39,280 --> 02:08:41,200
I've quit that country.

2342
02:08:41,510 --> 02:08:45,360
Then why are you sad every 
time Virat gets out at 99.

2343
02:08:46,360 --> 02:08:47,400
And that's not all, Sanjana...

2344
02:08:47,600 --> 02:08:51,440
Whenever India loses a match, 
he thinks the match has been fixed.

2345
02:08:54,200 --> 02:08:55,830
You've distanced yourself 
from the country...

2346
02:08:57,450 --> 02:08:59,650
...but the country always 
dwells in your heart.

2347
02:09:01,720 --> 02:09:04,070
It still beats in your heart.

2348
02:09:07,390 --> 02:09:16,320
"All our deeds will be for you, 
o Motherland."

2349
02:09:16,740 --> 02:09:18,950
"I've given my heart..."

2350
02:09:19,030 --> 02:09:26,070
"...and also my life, 
for you o Motherland."

2351
02:09:26,570 --> 02:09:35,780
"We'll live and die 
for you my motherland."

2352
02:10:04,970 --> 02:10:06,900
What is this?

2353
02:10:07,190 --> 02:10:10,480
Not our old street food business again.

2354
02:10:10,560 --> 02:10:11,940
Get lost.

2355
02:10:12,960 --> 02:10:14,530
Don't worry, brother-in-law.

2356
02:10:14,620 --> 02:10:17,400
They are true Indians.

2357
02:10:20,510 --> 02:10:21,530
Where is my money?

2358
02:10:21,610 --> 02:10:23,740
You fraud!

2359
02:10:23,820 --> 02:10:24,930
Fraud!

2360
02:10:25,010 --> 02:10:26,220
What money?

2361
02:10:29,510 --> 02:10:30,600
Is it Loaded?

2362
02:10:31,090 --> 02:10:32,300
Then unload it.

2363
02:10:37,310 --> 02:10:38,350
Stupid...

2364
02:10:38,430 --> 02:10:40,650
Shoot here. Mad females.

2365
02:10:40,730 --> 02:10:42,220
They can't shoot here.

2366
02:10:42,470 --> 02:10:44,390
Otherwise, they are dead.

2367
02:10:44,930 --> 02:10:46,500
And if they are dead, 
then the money goes with them.

2368
02:10:46,580 --> 02:10:48,330
And if the money's gone, then so is he.

2369
02:10:48,410 --> 02:10:49,420
Really.

2370
02:10:50,110 --> 02:10:51,140
He is a insolent.

2371
02:10:51,220 --> 02:10:55,390
Look, you see... 
they are bigger scoundrels than you.

2372
02:10:55,470 --> 02:10:56,950
We'll get your money.

2373
02:10:57,510 --> 02:10:59,680
Modi Sir, lend me your gun.

2374
02:11:00,950 --> 02:11:02,010
Relax.

2375
02:11:02,870 --> 02:11:04,680
You should have targeted them.

2376
02:11:05,100 --> 02:11:06,930
Now...where is the money?

2377
02:11:07,010 --> 02:11:09,100
Or else I will shoot them.

2378
02:11:09,180 --> 02:11:09,850
Papa.

2379
02:11:09,930 --> 02:11:11,290
What do you mean shoot them?

2380
02:11:11,370 --> 02:11:12,870
My daughter's with them too.

2381
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:14,000
Hello. What?

2382
02:11:14,080 --> 02:11:15,250
Janvi, come on this side.

2383
02:11:15,330 --> 02:11:16,920
- Dear come here. 
- Chandu, come with me.

2384
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:17,580
No.

2385
02:11:18,210 --> 02:11:19,870
- Papa! 
- No, no.

2386
02:11:19,950 --> 02:11:21,130
He's your future son-in-law.

2387
02:11:21,210 --> 02:11:22,370
- No, I said. 
- Papa...

2388
02:11:22,460 --> 02:11:23,290
Papa...

2389
02:11:23,370 --> 02:11:25,910
- Okay, fine. Come on. 
- Chandu come.

2390
02:11:26,660 --> 02:11:29,830
- Go ahead. 
- I am like Modi sir's daughter.

2391
02:11:30,370 --> 02:11:32,210
I used to work at 
his bungalow as a ghost.

2392
02:11:33,500 --> 02:11:34,740
Yeah...

2393
02:11:34,820 --> 02:11:36,120
You too.

2394
02:11:36,200 --> 02:11:37,170
Yes!

2395
02:11:37,250 --> 02:11:38,290
Wow!

2396
02:11:38,370 --> 02:11:41,540
If she's like his daughter, 
then I am like his son.

2397
02:11:41,690 --> 02:11:43,010
Come on.

2398
02:11:43,090 --> 02:11:43,960
Okay.

2399
02:11:44,040 --> 02:11:44,620
Easy.

2400
02:11:44,710 --> 02:11:45,870
- Excuse me. 
- Yes.

2401
02:11:46,410 --> 02:11:47,330
Can I come over too.

2402
02:11:47,410 --> 02:11:48,660
You don't get to move.

2403
02:11:48,750 --> 02:11:51,620
Because you're neither 
my son-in-law nor his.

2404
02:11:51,710 --> 02:11:52,540
Correct.

2405
02:11:52,620 --> 02:11:55,710
And if everyone changes 
sides then who am I going to ask?

2406
02:11:56,350 --> 02:11:57,750
Who am I going to ask?

2407
02:11:57,830 --> 02:11:58,910
Take my gun.

2408
02:12:05,710 --> 02:12:07,710
Tell your women to put their guns down.

2409
02:12:07,790 --> 02:12:09,180
Guns down.

2410
02:12:09,260 --> 02:12:11,370
- Guns down. 
- Put it down.

2411
02:12:11,450 --> 02:12:12,830
- Put it down. 
- Throw..

2412
02:12:12,910 --> 02:12:14,290
Put it down.

2413
02:12:14,370 --> 02:12:16,520
Put it down.

2414
02:12:16,600 --> 02:12:18,090
- Put it down. 
- Come on!

2415
02:12:20,710 --> 02:12:21,660
Raj.

2416
02:12:22,080 --> 02:12:22,960
Sanjana.

2417
02:12:29,080 --> 02:12:33,120
No one dared to raise a finger at me, 
and you pointed a gun at me.

2418
02:12:33,790 --> 02:12:35,500
- I will kill your... 
- Wait.

2419
02:12:36,710 --> 02:12:38,620
Here... 
Here's your money.

2420
02:12:39,910 --> 02:12:40,710
Hello.

2421
02:12:49,240 --> 02:12:51,260
- How was the trip, uncle? 
- Shut up.

2422
02:13:06,360 --> 02:13:10,420
It's back. 
My money's back.

2423
02:13:11,710 --> 02:13:14,070
10% is ours money. Isn't it?

2424
02:13:19,910 --> 02:13:22,240
How much money could this be?

2425
02:13:22,750 --> 02:13:28,750
Well...even if everyone grabs a bundle, 
they can live in luxury.

2426
02:13:28,830 --> 02:13:30,000
What are they saying?

2427
02:13:30,210 --> 02:13:31,790
How to become rich.

2428
02:13:32,460 --> 02:13:36,540
Their entire generations 
can live in luxury.

2429
02:13:38,520 --> 02:13:40,120
They will roll in Mercedes.

2430
02:13:40,210 --> 02:13:42,550
- Wow! 
- I am feeling to take money and run away.

2431
02:13:43,960 --> 02:13:47,300
Idiot...stop trying 
to provoke my people.

2432
02:14:04,480 --> 02:14:06,300
They are loyal to me.

2433
02:14:06,380 --> 02:14:08,800
They won't lift a 
finger without asking me.

2434
02:14:10,240 --> 02:14:15,800
I am not some angel who won't 
change loyalties for so much money.

2435
02:14:15,990 --> 02:14:21,020
My boys...keep this 
money in Baba Jani's car.

2436
02:14:22,480 --> 02:14:26,660
My boys...keep the money in my car.

2437
02:14:27,640 --> 02:14:29,210
Tulli Bro...

2438
02:14:29,290 --> 02:14:31,140
I am your older brother.

2439
02:14:31,220 --> 02:14:33,890
No brother, lover, or mother.

2440
02:14:33,970 --> 02:14:35,830
Money is all I know.

2441
02:14:36,150 --> 02:14:37,810
Put the money in my car.

2442
02:14:37,890 --> 02:14:39,330
Bulli...

2443
02:14:39,410 --> 02:14:41,160
They are fighting...

2444
02:14:41,240 --> 02:14:44,850
- My neck. Leave... 
- Come and get it.

2445
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:47,410
Come and get it. Come and get it.

2446
02:14:47,600 --> 02:14:49,470
Come and get it.

2447
02:14:49,780 --> 02:14:50,730
Come on!

2448
02:14:51,470 --> 02:14:54,210
- Very good. Come and get it. 
- My money.

2449
02:14:54,390 --> 02:14:56,040
My money.

2450
02:14:57,000 --> 02:14:59,670
- Move.. 
- Come and get it.

2451
02:15:01,460 --> 02:15:03,210
- Where are you going? 
- Let's go.

2452
02:15:03,290 --> 02:15:04,330
What is going no?

2453
02:15:04,410 --> 02:15:07,720
Things happen when they 
are supposed to happen.

2454
02:15:07,800 --> 02:15:10,870
Very good. Take money and run!

2455
02:15:11,050 --> 02:15:12,230
Run!

2456
02:15:18,070 --> 02:15:20,540
Stop or else I will kill you.

2457
02:15:22,110 --> 02:15:24,870
I am Niraj Modi.

2458
02:15:25,130 --> 02:15:28,210
Gujrat's lion, raised in Palampur.

2459
02:15:30,210 --> 02:15:31,740
I am a lion.

2460
02:15:34,260 --> 02:15:37,250
I can pull your guts out.

2461
02:15:38,030 --> 02:15:40,060
Are you scared now?

2462
02:15:42,360 --> 02:15:43,710
Getting goosebumps.

2463
02:15:44,180 --> 02:15:46,770
You'll get it too. Look behind you.

2464
02:15:47,840 --> 02:15:50,280
Palampur's lions are coming this way.

2465
02:15:50,480 --> 02:15:52,040
Turn back, idiot.

2466
02:16:00,340 --> 02:16:01,400
Help!

2467
02:16:08,900 --> 02:16:11,330
Brother-in-law, lion!

2468
02:16:12,210 --> 02:16:14,140
Run.

2469
02:16:14,420 --> 02:16:16,210
Run.

2470
02:16:19,790 --> 02:16:21,790
Where did these lions come from?

2471
02:16:23,250 --> 02:16:24,790
Let's go in car.

2472
02:16:36,710 --> 02:16:38,620
Where did these lions come from?

2473
02:16:38,710 --> 02:16:41,440
Priest, what do the stars say today?

2474
02:16:41,520 --> 02:16:44,080
- The lions are going to have a feast. 
- Damn!

2475
02:16:45,630 --> 02:16:48,710
These expensive cars... 
don't have a decent door.

2476
02:16:57,180 --> 02:16:58,330
Uncle's fainted.

2477
02:16:58,410 --> 02:17:01,460
What kind of uncle is he? 
He keeps fainting all the time.

2478
02:17:07,980 --> 02:17:11,810
Everyone's inside the car, and he...

2479
02:17:21,660 --> 02:17:22,540
Driver...

2480
02:17:22,670 --> 02:17:24,040
Me...at the back.

2481
02:17:29,320 --> 02:17:31,920
This window is not working.

2482
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:33,120
Brother WiFi

2483
02:17:33,370 --> 02:17:34,490
Brother...

2484
02:17:35,450 --> 02:17:37,210
When in trouble, 
people resort to any means.

2485
02:17:37,290 --> 02:17:38,460
I am just calling you brother.

2486
02:17:38,960 --> 02:17:40,100
Excuse me.

2487
02:17:42,210 --> 02:17:43,790
Yes, lion.

2488
02:17:50,870 --> 02:17:53,000
Strong words from a weak stomach.

2489
02:17:53,080 --> 02:17:54,750
Big words from a weak stomach.

2490
02:17:54,830 --> 02:17:56,720
He's got big jaws 
and even bigger stomach.

2491
02:18:39,780 --> 02:18:42,630
"Singham..!"

2492
02:18:51,230 --> 02:18:52,140
Thank you.

2493
02:19:01,040 --> 02:19:02,210
One selfie.

2494
02:19:02,290 --> 02:19:05,000
- One selfie, please. 
- Please stop for mother's sake.

2495
02:19:05,140 --> 02:19:06,710
First sister now a mother.

2496
02:19:06,790 --> 02:19:09,290
What do you think you're doing?

2497
02:19:09,370 --> 02:19:11,870
Where did these lions come from?

2498
02:19:11,950 --> 02:19:13,960
Why don't you go ask them? Go...

2499
02:19:19,890 --> 02:19:21,290
Why did you lie beside me?

2500
02:19:21,470 --> 02:19:24,080
If the lion finds out that we're acting, 
he will eat us.

2501
02:19:24,160 --> 02:19:25,660
How will he know?

2502
02:19:25,800 --> 02:19:27,200
He's a lion, not a donkey.

2503
02:19:28,600 --> 02:19:29,550
He is coming.

2504
02:19:41,640 --> 02:19:43,690
Did he run away or is he still here?

2505
02:19:43,770 --> 02:19:45,410
Are you scared now?

2506
02:19:45,690 --> 02:19:48,460
They are so huge, anyone will be scared.

2507
02:19:55,460 --> 02:19:56,520
Raj!

2508
02:19:57,170 --> 02:19:58,180
Chandu!

2509
02:19:58,790 --> 02:19:59,690
Junky.

2510
02:19:59,770 --> 02:20:01,550
Sorry folks. Don't get afraid.

2511
02:20:01,630 --> 02:20:02,830
They won't harm anyone.

2512
02:20:02,910 --> 02:20:04,220
I can understand Junky.

2513
02:20:05,310 --> 02:20:07,330
But Chandu and Raj?

2514
02:20:14,480 --> 02:20:15,540
Gone.

2515
02:20:15,690 --> 02:20:16,740
Where were we?

2516
02:20:16,880 --> 02:20:18,030
Looting the money.

2517
02:20:18,180 --> 02:20:19,130
Then continue.

2518
02:20:19,210 --> 02:20:21,540
Loot the money.

2519
02:20:21,830 --> 02:20:24,120
Take all money.

2520
02:20:24,200 --> 02:20:27,430
Come on. Take it all money.

2521
02:20:33,050 --> 02:20:35,960
Rascals, I'll get your 
kidney transplanted to my dog.

2522
02:20:36,040 --> 02:20:37,300
You ruined me.

2523
02:20:37,380 --> 02:20:38,940
Abracadabra

2524
02:20:39,020 --> 02:20:41,040
You bloody rascal.

2525
02:20:41,750 --> 02:20:43,630
Idiot, rascal, miser.

2526
02:20:43,800 --> 02:20:44,860
Miser?

2527
02:20:44,940 --> 02:20:45,880
Wow!

2528
02:20:45,960 --> 02:20:48,230
- Where it come from? 
- Don't know.

2529
02:20:48,310 --> 02:20:50,830
- How? 
- But that doesn't make any sense.

2530
02:20:50,910 --> 02:20:52,670
Everything doesn't need to make sense.

2531
02:20:52,750 --> 02:20:55,190
If someone talks sense 
in this senseless world...

2532
02:20:55,270 --> 02:20:57,550
...then that senseless statement 
might actually make sense.

2533
02:20:57,630 --> 02:21:00,170
And living with a 
senseless man like you...

2534
02:21:00,250 --> 02:21:02,010
...means everything in 
the world starts to make sense.

2535
02:21:02,090 --> 02:21:03,520
- What did he said? 
- Well said.

2536
02:21:03,600 --> 02:21:05,380
Superb!

2537
02:21:05,460 --> 02:21:07,210
Unbelievable!

2538
02:21:12,450 --> 02:21:13,590
Oh no!

2539
02:21:33,180 --> 02:21:35,330
Uncle. Uncle.

2540
02:21:35,410 --> 02:21:38,040
I am ruined. 
They left nothing.

2541
02:21:38,120 --> 02:21:40,460
These people distributed all my money.

2542
02:21:40,750 --> 02:21:42,870
Have you lost your mind?

2543
02:21:44,040 --> 02:21:46,330
These three are born paupers.

2544
02:21:46,640 --> 02:21:49,210
And they turned these 
two into paupers as well.

2545
02:21:49,290 --> 02:21:54,540
If someone's looting their 
money will they just stand and watch?

2546
02:21:55,080 --> 02:21:56,000
Think about it.

2547
02:21:56,330 --> 02:21:57,480
What do you mean?

2548
02:21:57,960 --> 02:22:00,370
I mean that money was fake.

2549
02:22:01,210 --> 02:22:02,370
You mean they...

2550
02:22:02,460 --> 02:22:05,040
Not them. 
Him.

2551
02:22:05,520 --> 02:22:06,750
WiFi...

2552
02:22:06,970 --> 02:22:10,580
Now tell us where is the real money...

2553
02:22:11,080 --> 02:22:15,120
...which they are dreaming 
of taking back to India.

2554
02:22:15,640 --> 02:22:20,850
Not just the money, we made a plan to 
take this little guy to India as well.

2555
02:22:21,380 --> 02:22:23,470
But I guess God is very kind...

2556
02:22:24,170 --> 02:22:26,330
...that he's sent you as a bonus.

2557
02:22:27,040 --> 02:22:30,570
Look around you.

2558
02:22:30,860 --> 02:22:35,640
I can think of 2 dozen 
ways to get the money out of you.

2559
02:22:36,180 --> 02:22:37,260
See.

2560
02:22:37,780 --> 02:22:39,000
Come on...

2561
02:22:41,020 --> 02:22:46,660
Now tell your God 
to stop uncle if he can.

2562
02:22:49,160 --> 02:22:50,670
- Uncle! 
- Uncle get hurt.

2563
02:22:50,750 --> 02:22:51,860
Uncle!

2564
02:23:03,800 --> 02:23:05,060
Hurry up!

2565
02:23:32,830 --> 02:23:34,330
Bulli!

2566
02:23:37,260 --> 02:23:38,340
You..

2567
02:24:07,170 --> 02:24:08,250
Sir, late again.

2568
02:24:08,330 --> 02:24:10,910
I had to take him back 
to India along with the money.

2569
02:24:10,990 --> 02:24:13,450
Had to go through a lot 
of Interpol's formalities.

2570
02:24:13,530 --> 02:24:15,400
Sir, we're just small fish.

2571
02:24:15,480 --> 02:24:18,410
There are bigger crocodiles 
who fled with more money.

2572
02:24:18,490 --> 02:24:21,460
We'll start with you 
and the rest will follow.

2573
02:24:22,120 --> 02:24:23,790
- Shall we go? 
- Just a minute, sir.

2574
02:24:23,870 --> 02:24:26,290
I have a gift for you 
from the people of my nation.

2575
02:24:26,370 --> 02:24:27,350
Give it to me.

2576
02:24:27,430 --> 02:24:29,080
- Shall I? 
- Give it to me.

2577
02:24:35,530 --> 02:24:38,910
If you had hit any harder 
he would've landed in Tihar Jail.

2578
02:24:44,980 --> 02:24:47,030
I said you'll get defaced.

2579
02:24:47,110 --> 02:24:47,920
Now see...

2580
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:51,130
Priest, you said something 
about Raj as well.

2581
02:24:51,210 --> 02:24:52,270
I did...

2582
02:24:52,750 --> 02:24:56,030
But I just realised that 
your intentions are clean...

2583
02:24:56,110 --> 02:25:02,000
...and you're honest, 
then even bad luck can't harm him.

2584
02:25:02,220 --> 02:25:05,540
- Great. 
- Pandit is also well said.

2585
02:25:05,620 --> 02:25:06,580
Right?

2586
02:25:06,660 --> 02:25:08,410
Sorry, no comments.

2587
02:25:16,150 --> 02:25:19,120
Ladies and gentleman now I am your DJ

2588
02:25:31,120 --> 02:25:32,160
What are you doing?

2589
02:25:32,660 --> 02:25:33,620
Action!

2590
02:25:34,670 --> 02:25:36,750
Sometimes, behind closed doors...

2591
02:25:38,750 --> 02:25:39,290
One more.

2592
02:25:39,370 --> 02:25:40,750
"1,2,1,2,1"

2593
02:25:40,830 --> 02:25:43,330
In the age of emails and whatsapp who 
the bloody hell writes a love letter?

2594
02:25:43,660 --> 02:25:46,620
My line was first which they ate up.

2595
02:25:46,840 --> 02:25:48,330
- They ate your lines? 
- Yes.

2596
02:25:48,410 --> 02:25:49,410
It's okay.

2597
02:25:49,590 --> 02:25:50,780
Look at him.

2598
02:25:50,860 --> 02:25:54,320
"Don't rack your brains 
because they don't have any."

2599
02:25:54,400 --> 02:25:58,950
"There's none like them 
In the other world as well"

2600
02:25:59,030 --> 02:26:00,370
Otherwise I'll..

2601
02:26:00,670 --> 02:26:02,330
Otherwise I... What?

2602
02:26:03,310 --> 02:26:09,110
"Don't rack your brains 
because they don't have any."

2603
02:26:10,330 --> 02:26:11,330
Cheapster.

2604
02:26:11,410 --> 02:26:12,290
Rough.

2605
02:26:12,370 --> 02:26:17,250
"They think of many different things 
when the bell in their mind rings."

2606
02:26:21,090 --> 02:26:23,140
"Madness..."

2607
02:26:25,570 --> 02:26:27,370
"Madness..."

2608
02:26:30,130 --> 02:26:32,030
"Madness..."

2609
02:26:32,110 --> 02:26:33,750
I forgot dialogue...

2610
02:26:34,370 --> 02:26:36,580
"Madness..."

2611
02:26:39,610 --> 02:26:41,890
- 48 hours.. 
- It's 47..

2612
02:26:41,970 --> 02:26:43,660
Oh yes 47...

2613
02:26:44,040 --> 02:26:44,460
Cut..

2614
02:26:44,540 --> 02:26:46,760
Donkey is okay but...

2615
02:26:47,010 --> 02:26:47,750
Cut.

2616
02:26:47,940 --> 02:26:48,610
Cut...

2617
02:26:48,690 --> 02:26:50,120
He is saying... cut.

2618
02:26:50,620 --> 02:26:52,050
Skydiving was your idea.

2619
02:26:52,130 --> 02:26:52,970
Cut it.

2620
02:26:53,050 --> 02:26:56,210
You've brought sour mangoes again.

2621
02:26:59,660 --> 02:27:01,750
"This is madness."

2622
02:27:01,830 --> 02:27:03,370
"This is madness."

2623
02:27:05,370 --> 02:27:08,110
"We're a little bad by nature."

2624
02:27:08,280 --> 02:27:10,250
I don't know what's happening.

2625
02:27:10,330 --> 02:27:12,130
"Even rascals sweat in front of them."

2626
02:27:12,210 --> 02:27:14,120
"They bow to them."

2627
02:27:14,250 --> 02:27:15,710
He's fainted.

2628
02:27:15,790 --> 02:27:17,000
Fainted.

2629
02:27:18,870 --> 02:27:21,000
"Why they think himself smart?"

2630
02:27:21,080 --> 02:27:23,170
"Tell me what you want"

2631
02:27:23,250 --> 02:27:26,000
"Taking wrong advantage 
of my kindness"

2632
02:27:26,080 --> 02:27:27,660
700... I gave you cheque book.

2633
02:27:27,750 --> 02:27:32,260
"He is behaving like 
a crazy monkey."

2634
02:27:32,340 --> 02:27:34,540
"Madness..."

2635
02:27:34,620 --> 02:27:36,520
"1,2,1,2 go, go."

2636
02:27:36,600 --> 02:27:39,040
"Madness..."

2637
02:27:41,010 --> 02:27:43,130
"Madness..."

2638
02:27:43,210 --> 02:27:45,710
Like this, up...

2639
02:27:45,790 --> 02:27:47,330
Wait a moment...

2640
02:27:47,610 --> 02:27:49,830
We all are crazy..."

2641
02:27:49,910 --> 02:27:52,120
"Madness..."

2642
02:27:54,430 --> 02:27:58,930
My passport, money 
everything left there.

2643
02:27:59,010 --> 02:28:01,000
"Madness..."

2644
02:28:01,640 --> 02:28:03,330
Are you still acting or is it over yet?

2645
02:28:15,160 --> 02:28:16,750
Brother-in-law!

2646
02:28:21,790 --> 02:28:22,750
Pack up.
