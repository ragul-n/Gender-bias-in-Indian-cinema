Child! How are you? - I am very well, mom.

9
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,165
Why are you panting? - I was running, that's why.

10
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:13,770
He's running. Why are you running, dear?

11
00:03:14,547 --> 00:03:16,515
Mom, one has to do that during the training.

12
00:03:16,916 --> 00:03:20,181
I am very displeased with you, dear.

13
00:03:20,653 --> 00:03:24,783
Are you running..I mean are you listening to me?

14
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,192
You haven't written a letter to me this week.

15
00:03:30,529 --> 00:03:33,223
Don't you have time to write a few lines?

16
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:35,534
Mom, I'll go, and write you a letter right now

17
00:03:36,502 --> 00:03:39,335
Let's find a good girl for him, and get him married.

18
00:03:40,172 --> 00:03:43,571
We'll at least have a daughter-in-law in teh house,

19
00:03:44,976 --> 00:03:47,473
Not a bad idea. But our son might have already found one.

20
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:53,017
I konw my son well. He can't fall in love with a girl.

21
00:03:53,785 --> 00:03:55,515
But a girl can fall in love with him.

22
00:04:08,201 --> 00:04:09,227
What should I do? The tyre' stuck in there.

23
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:19,706
What's this? Couldn't you see such a big car?
Couldn't you see such a tall man?

24
00:04:20,514 --> 00:04:23,581
Oh my God! I've been losing the race for last 2 years.

25
00:04:23,584 --> 00:04:26,683
This time I left everyone behind. I had bright chances.

26
00:04:26,783 --> 00:04:28,983
Bit this time I'll lose again because of you guys.

27
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:31,023
Look, we didn't knw that...-Shut up!

28
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:32,955
Why are you riding bicycles in the  middle of teh road?

29
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:34,622
Look, this is a goverment road.

30
00:04:34,822 --> 00:04:37,422
Man, car Cycle, donkey, any thing and anyone can walk on.

31
00:04:48,941 --> 00:04:52,941
Don't cry! I'll try and do something. C'mon, guys.

32
00:04:53,179 --> 00:04:54,506
Move!

33
00:05:00,553 --> 00:05:03,313
How will the car get out of the pit? Take off your luggage!

34
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:06,021
Hey, she's not luggage; she's my friend, Nikki.

35
00:05:06,059 --> 00:05:10,054
Nikki, Pikki, Shikki, whoever she is, get her down.
Don't you want to win the race?

36
00:05:10,062 --> 00:05:12,288

00:05:14,233 --> 00:05:15,860
C'mon brothers!

38
00:05:28,648 --> 00:05:30,006
We've lost it now.

39
00:05:42,662 --> 00:05:45,129
Nikki! - Shut up! Keep quiet!

40
00:05:59,845 --> 00:06:03,012
Welcome. - What's the use now? Everything is finished.

41
00:06:03,113 --> 00:06:06,040
I've lost the race. Everyone is ahead of me.

42
00:06:06,151 --> 00:06:08,052
And it's happened because of you guys.

43
00:06:12,792 --> 00:06:14,890
So you want to win this race right? - Yes.

44
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:28,490
Hey! O my God!

45
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:43,690
O my God!

46
00:06:46,659 --> 00:06:48,022
What are you doing?

47
00:07:10,349 --> 00:07:11,578
Watch out!

48
00:07:18,278 --> 00:07:19,678
O my God!

49
00:07:35,541 --> 00:07:40,209
Congrats. Now you've won the race:others are behind.

50
00:07:48,854 --> 00:07:51,921
Vijay.- Roma. - Ok. I see.

51
00:07:56,562 --> 00:08:00,490
Why are you waiting here? Go, or you'll lose the race. Go!

52
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:16,047
What would I tell you, Ritu?

53
00:08:17,116 --> 00:08:20,613
This race has created uproar in my life.

54
00:08:21,553 --> 00:08:23,384
Something confusing has happened with me.

55
00:08:25,924 --> 00:08:29,319
I can't forget his face.

56
00:08:30,696 --> 00:08:35,895
I don't understand what magic he has cast
on me in just one meet.

57
00:08:37,641 --> 00:08:41,768
"O my sweetheart, you signaled to me."

58
00:08:41,868 --> 00:08:45,668
"O my sweetheart, you signaled to me.."

59
00:08:45,845 --> 00:08:49,244
"... at first sight. "

60
00:08:49,348 --> 00:09:04,512
"You stole my heart. You stole my heart."

61
00:09:13,505 --> 00:09:17,170
"You had suddenly touched me. "

62
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:20,916
" I can't explain what I felt."

63
00:09:21,084 --> 00:09:24,747
"I felt a band of colors around me. "

64
00:09:24,895 --> 00:09:32,392
"I was feeling dizzy.
I was feeling dizzy."

65
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:40,193
"There was a longing. There was a longing. "

66
00:09:40,603 --> 00:09:44,071
"My life changed."

67
00:09:44,244 --> 00:09:59,343
"You stole my heart. You stole my heart."

68
00:10:23,242 --> 00:10:27,041
"You're so pretty. You're so youthful."

69
00:10:27,179 --> 00:10:31,044
" I have no words to describe you."

70
00:10:31,116 --> 00:10:34,815
"You can make anyone fall in love with you."

71
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:42,612
"Where did you learn this magic?"

72
00:10:42,765 --> 00:10:50,694
"You smiled, o sweetheart.
you smiled, o sweetheart"

73
00:10:50,803 --> 00:10:54,072
"..at the first sight."

74
00:10:55,107 --> 00:11:02,172
"You stole my heart. You stole my heart."

75
00:11:03,185 --> 00:11:10,252
"O my sweetheart, you signaled to me."

76
00:11:10,389 --> 00:11:13,920
"... at first sight. "

77
00:11:14,026 --> 00:11:16,925
" You stole my heart."

78
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:21,099
" You stole my heart."

79
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:40,951
Stop these games now. Mr. Pandey has arrived from Delhi.

80
00:11:41,487 --> 00:11:43,785
Will he be on the rounds if he's come from Delhi?

81
00:11:44,156 --> 00:11:48,483
He must be tired by the trip. He'll rest for a while.

82
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:15,988
Give me the rest of the cards!

83
00:12:21,326 --> 00:12:24,090
Sir, we were..- Which game were you playing?

84
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:29,830
Well..Dehla Pakad.- Nice game! I used to play it a lot.

85
00:12:30,467 --> 00:12:32,334
No one could beat me at that.

86
00:12:34,373 --> 00:12:35,533
Sit down.

87
00:12:37,376 --> 00:12:38,502
Sit down.

88
00:12:40,145 --> 00:12:42,705
There was a time when I had a good hold over the cards.

89
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:47,114
I'm holding cards after many years today.

90
00:12:55,127 --> 00:13:00,064
Ok, tell me, how many aces are there in a pack?

91
00:13:02,002 --> 00:13:04,833
Devang! - There are four ces, sir.

92
00:13:05,471 --> 00:13:09,072
No, there's a fifth one too.

93
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:17,945
Why do you all look at me like that? There is a fifth ace.

94
00:13:18,617 --> 00:13:21,045
Right, Nilesh? - Sir..

95
00:13:23,555 --> 00:13:25,455
I'll show you the 5th ace.

96
00:13:30,863 --> 00:13:33,031
You all look very confused.

97
00:13:34,199 --> 00:13:38,435
Thinking where I shall get 5th ace, right?

98
00:13:40,272 --> 00:13:43,735
But you don't need to be so tensed.

99
00:13:44,447 --> 00:13:47,416
But I can't show you the 5th ace..

100
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:51,988
..because there's no 5th ace in the pack.

101
00:13:54,688 --> 00:13:56,488
You knew that well; ..

102
00:13:57,190 --> 00:14:00,751
..and yet, wny didn't you try to oppose me?

103
00:14:03,128 --> 00:14:06,957
Whoever is standing oppsite you, whatever post he might hold ...

104
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:11,096
... if he's saying something wrong, it is wrong.

105
00:14:12,271 --> 00:14:16,068
Have the courage to speak the truth with confidence.

106
00:14:17,342 --> 00:14:21,772
And detach yourselves from this pleasures and pastimes.

107
00:14:22,581 --> 00:14:24,415
The decisions of life are made,, ..

108
00:14:24,615 --> 00:14:27,615
..at the point where you are standing now.

109
00:14:29,088 --> 00:14:31,116
I will not tolerate any thing,..

110
00:14:31,216 --> 00:14:34,616
..that might be against the discipline from now on.

111
00:14:37,329 --> 00:14:40,926
Concentrate your hearts and minds fully on the training.

112
00:14:41,426 --> 00:14:42,726
You get that? - Sir!

113
00:14:54,326 --> 00:14:59,726
Come on. Come on.

114
00:15:03,393 --> 00:15:08,660
Hurry up! C'mon, move! Hurry up!

115
00:15:08,763 --> 00:15:12,730
6 seconds more. Hurry up!
C'mon next!

116
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:16,430
Hurdle jumping..! Hurry up!!

117
00:15:48,734 --> 00:15:50,702
You all are going to Mumbai.

118
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:54,802
You are to help your senior officers..

119
00:15:55,002 --> 00:15:58,002
..to arrange the election security.

120
00:15:58,777 --> 00:16:01,041
It's a well-know matter now that..

121
00:16:02,241 --> 00:16:07,241
..some violent incidents take place on every election.

122
00:16:08,187 --> 00:16:12,788
So some special arrangements
are made for the security.

123
00:16:13,992 --> 00:16:17,793
Our aim is to get the antisocial powers under control ...

124
00:16:18,496 --> 00:16:21,263
... and to protect the lives and property of the laymen.

125
00:16:22,134 --> 00:16:25,731
You will be assigned jobs from the senior officers every day...

126
00:16:26,504 --> 00:16:30,507
... And you are to finish those jobs according to their advice.

127
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:36,844
There might arise situations, where you'll be given weapons...

128
00:16:37,649 --> 00:16:42,008
..you will informed clearly when, where ...

129
00:16:42,121 --> 00:16:44,350
... and under which situations you are to use them.

130
00:16:44,456 --> 00:16:49,457
Yes, I'll also be appointed there as an additional officer.

131
00:16:50,462 --> 00:16:53,192
I'll be joining you there within a few days.

132
00:16:54,366 --> 00:16:59,994
I know you will miss this academy..

133
00:17:02,009 --> 00:17:05,309
..and I'll miss you all.

134
00:17:10,509 --> 00:17:12,909
You all bloody jokers!

135
00:17:24,996 --> 00:17:29,328
Mr. Pandey must have told you are sent here.

136
00:17:32,938 --> 00:17:34,868
Your job will be to understand the duty officers,..

137
00:17:36,377 --> 00:17:40,276
..and follow their orders.

138
00:17:41,246 --> 00:17:45,042
Your seniors know the rules and regulations..

139
00:17:46,118 --> 00:17:47,216
..of the department better;they're experienced.

140
00:17:48,055 --> 00:17:54,287
So you are to accept their orders
without any doubts or questions.

141
00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:03,662
You will never give a thought to
what you wish or think you're on training.

142
00:18:04,437 --> 00:18:06,405
You'll be having around 20 days training here.

143
00:18:07,706 --> 00:18:12,702
Meanwhile, if by mistake someone does something..

144
00:18:13,245 --> 00:18:15,609
... that is against the discipline ...

145
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:21,919
... he will be responsible for his loss.

146
00:18:23,989 --> 00:18:27,587
You're to report at headquarter at 9 o'clock. When? -9.

147
00:18:27,692 --> 00:18:28,459
- At 9 o'clock.

148
00:18:32,898 --> 00:18:36,158
I see; so you're from Devlali?
- Yes.

149
00:18:36,201 --> 00:18:37,996
I am also related to Devlali.

150
00:18:38,105 --> 00:18:41,997
The rice mill in Nangdaon is that of my cousin.

151
00:18:42,274 --> 00:18:46,471
Be ready; you'll get a good scolding from me from now on!

152
00:18:47,078 --> 00:18:50,939
I'm not only your senior, but also your relative.

153
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:53,439
All right. Köszönöm.

154
00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:02,117
Vijay? You? Here in Mumbai?

155
00:19:03,161 --> 00:19:04,725
I never thought you'd be here.

156
00:19:04,898 --> 00:19:07,226
Look, you seem to be mistaken. My name's not Vijay.

157
00:19:07,426 --> 00:19:08,826
I am Anil. Anil Sinha.

158
00:19:11,536 --> 00:19:14,004
Don't joke!
You don't know how much I..

159
00:19:14,573 --> 00:19:17,100
I am not Vijay!
- But.. Vijay ...

160
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:21,744
Enough of this joke, Vijay. People are watching us.

161
00:19:21,913 --> 00:19:24,279
Of course they'll watch! You're talking nonsense.

162
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:27,618
You're calling me Vijay, when I am  Anil Sinha.

163
00:19:27,719 --> 00:19:31,187
I don't konw you;I've never met you.
-Shut up!

164
00:19:31,323 --> 00:19:32,883
You met me in Nashik.

165
00:19:32,926 --> 00:19:36,195
I was on a car race, and your cycle bumped into my car.

166
00:19:36,395 --> 00:19:38,295
You helped me win the race.

167
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:40,298
You were at the police training camp there.

168
00:19:40,432 --> 00:19:43,130
Police training camp?
I am cashier at the State Bank.

169
00:19:43,235 --> 00:19:44,803
I've been working there for 4 years.

170
00:19:45,537 --> 00:19:49,298
Looks like you're mistaken. Perhaps Vijay looks like me.

171
00:19:49,341 --> 00:19:53,004
Anil, there's a call for you. - Excuse me.

172
00:19:53,345 --> 00:19:55,713
Yes..yes, it's Anil here.

173
00:19:57,015 --> 00:20:01,473
Do this! Deposit the draft. Ok, I'll talk to the manager. OK.

174
00:20:01,758 --> 00:20:10,427
Ok!..Ok!..Fine! ..I am sorry!..
You are Anil. Mr. Anil Synha. I am sorry.

175
00:20:10,963 --> 00:20:12,560
Did you win the race that day?

176
00:20:13,566 --> 00:20:16,134
You must have got a medal. A gold medal.

177
00:20:19,371 --> 00:20:23,067
Hey,Roma! Listen!... I was just kidding, Roma!

178
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:30,953
"You will love me eventually"

179
00:20:31,857 --> 00:20:37,859
"You will love me eventually"

180
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:44,792
"You will love me eventually"

181
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:48,291
"You will love me eventually"

182
00:20:49,203 --> 00:20:51,436
"You will agree to me."

183
00:20:52,036 --> 00:20:57,536
"You will confess to me eventually."

184
00:20:58,436 --> 00:21:04,336
"You will love me eventually"

185
00:21:05,483 --> 00:21:11,944
"You will know me. You will understand me."

186
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:18,193
"You'll be impressed by me eventually."

187
00:21:18,593 --> 00:21:24,193
"You will know me eventually."

188
00:21:45,624 --> 00:21:48,415
"Darling, give me a place in your heart."

189
00:21:48,594 --> 00:21:51,563
"I'm crazy after you."

190
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:55,399
"My dear, come closer to me."

191
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,830
"This world cannot harm us."

192
00:21:58,937 --> 00:22:05,740
"My disregard says that your love is false."

193
00:22:08,614 --> 00:22:15,249
"You will love me. You will agree to me."

194
00:22:15,387 --> 00:22:21,056
"You will confess to me eventually."

195
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:28,165
"You will know me eventually."

196
00:22:42,281 --> 00:22:45,681
"Your eyes are pretty.Your face is pink."

197
00:22:45,784 --> 00:22:48,982
"Heavens! What beauty!"

198
00:22:49,087 --> 00:22:52,347
"If your beauty is like ember."

199
00:22:52,423 --> 00:22:55,621
"I'd like to burn my heart."

200
00:22:55,827 --> 00:23:02,494
"I won't believe you. I won't come with you."

201
00:23:05,436 --> 00:23:11,636
"You will look into my eyes. You will agree to me."

202
00:23:11,936 --> 00:23:17,536
"You will confess to me eventually."

203
00:23:18,117 --> 00:23:24,078
"You will love me eventually"

204
00:23:48,213 --> 00:23:50,381
Get him out.- C'mon, get out.

205
00:23:51,816 --> 00:23:53,750
Why are you pushing? What's this behavior?

206
00:23:54,219 --> 00:23:56,187
C'mon, move!
- Don't touch me.

207
00:24:03,929 --> 00:24:06,090
Hey how does Rum give you a kick?

208
00:24:10,802 --> 00:24:13,971
Kept sitting for 3 hours: got bored at last.
I was attending a wedding.

209
00:24:14,139 --> 00:24:16,168
Give me a cigarette.- What's the problem?

210
00:24:16,408 --> 00:24:18,376
I want you for a task,Saxena.

211
00:24:19,511 --> 00:24:24,670
I hear that you're holding back the NOC for the project

212
00:24:25,183 --> 00:24:28,050
..that Khanna Builders want to make on the Kapasvadi.

213
00:24:30,855 --> 00:24:35,755
I've got the documents here.
Sign them!

214
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:37,384
Wow, Dadabhai!

215
00:24:37,696 --> 00:24:42,526
You had forecast a protest by the poor people
living on that land of Kapasvadi.

216
00:24:43,668 --> 00:24:47,495
You had fasted saying that they should get
concrete houses there.

217
00:24:48,072 --> 00:24:51,940
To the extent that your men had raided,
and broke the office of Khanna Builders.

218
00:24:52,410 --> 00:24:55,435
And now you're speaking on behalf of Khanna Builders?!

219
00:24:55,713 --> 00:24:59,107
You want me to sign and make those poor people homeless?

220
00:24:59,784 --> 00:25:05,450
Good! Very good! I liked it Saxena!
I'll get you a Padmashree award. For your honesty.

221
00:25:06,124 --> 00:25:10,858
You're very honest, aren't you? Honest..

222
00:25:12,331 --> 00:25:15,261
Honest..Let's see how long your honesty goes.

223
00:25:15,361 --> 00:25:17,861
I know of ways to break the honesty of people like you.

224
00:25:18,003 --> 00:25:19,630
Get the gift!

225
00:25:38,056 --> 00:25:43,819
Where is my sohn? What..what did you do to him? Where is he?

226
00:25:43,895 --> 00:25:45,687
He's alive. You want to see him alive, don't you?

227
00:25:45,863 --> 00:25:49,755
Dada! Dadabhai this is not fair. What wrong have I done to you?

228
00:25:49,767 --> 00:25:51,833
Shut up! I don't have time to waste.

229
00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:53,630
You want your child? Do you want him alive?

230
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:57,630
Or I'll give you his pieces. You can hang them on your honesty.

231
00:26:05,149 --> 00:26:10,552
C'mon, sign now. My work is halted; sign fast.

232
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:30,207
Mr. Desai! - Welcome, Dadabhai!

233
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:33,610
You've changed the office completely.

234
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:37,876
Looks like you changed the interior.- Yes, a little.

235
00:26:37,949 --> 00:26:39,678
Here.

236
00:26:54,565 --> 00:26:58,924
The job is accurate. - I always do a solid job.

237
00:27:00,071 --> 00:27:06,771
Otherwise I don't take it up. Here Dadabhai, it's 5 lakh rupees.

238
00:27:06,878 --> 00:27:09,205
You can get it counted.

239
00:27:09,814 --> 00:27:12,441
What do you mean get it counted? Is there a business between us?

240
00:27:13,151 --> 00:27:16,682
Yet.. it's a matter of money..- I am a broker or what?

241
00:27:17,455 --> 00:27:19,518
What do you think me to be?

242
00:27:19,724 --> 00:27:22,386
You asked me something out of friendshiep, and I did it.

243
00:27:23,094 --> 00:27:25,324
I'm taking the money as I need it.

244
00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:29,697
Mr. Khanna, the relationship of give and take is over between us.

245
00:27:30,868 --> 00:27:32,536
If someday I need 3-4 laksh more,..

246
00:27:32,637 --> 00:27:35,335
..is it necessary that you'd give me only if I do some job for you?

247
00:27:37,342 --> 00:27:40,911
Right, Mr Desa? - No..it's ok. Dada.

248
00:27:47,218 --> 00:27:49,682
You just support me in this election.

249
00:27:50,955 --> 00:27:54,019
I will defeat Raatan Setit so badly ...

250
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:59,188
... that there will be only smoke left in his life.
There will be no colors for him.

251
00:28:03,388 --> 00:28:04,588
Sir, this is Lantena.

252
00:28:04,788 --> 00:28:07,088
It blooms throughout the year except monsoon.

253
00:28:07,288 --> 00:28:08,288
Please, come further.

254
00:28:08,388 --> 00:28:12,088
This is Double Wogan Miller. It flowers throughout the year.

255
00:28:13,077 --> 00:28:17,336
Wow! Such a lovely harmony of colors!

256
00:28:19,036 --> 00:28:21,736
Sir, this is Masanta. It blooms 3 times a year.

257
00:28:25,436 --> 00:28:30,536
Really. God's creation is fantastic. It's great.

258
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:36,436
And this is Pinotia, sir. - No!

259
00:28:37,336 --> 00:28:41,536
No, young man, this is not Pinotia.
This is Pointsitia.

260
00:28:41,639 --> 00:28:44,867
It has a nickname, too. It's called fireball.

261
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:49,907
When it's fully bloomed, it looks like a ball of fire.

262
00:28:50,648 --> 00:28:55,314
It is presented on Christmas.
So it's also called Christmas flower.

263
00:28:56,654 --> 00:29:00,351
Why are you all silent? Am I wrong?

264
00:29:00,426 --> 00:29:01,423
No, sir, you are right.

265
00:29:01,923 --> 00:29:03,523
We put on the wrong label.

266
00:29:09,223 --> 00:29:13,623
It's beautiful. Fireball!

267
00:29:16,441 --> 00:29:19,240
I liked the capaign planning. I've approved it.

268
00:29:20,545 --> 00:29:23,013
But the party will not approve this budget.

269
00:29:24,782 --> 00:29:26,340
What are our personal arrangements?

270
00:29:26,718 --> 00:29:29,678
Sir, we haven't received a clear answer from Khatri, and Gulati.

271
00:29:30,087 --> 00:29:33,989
They haven't fulfilled their promise for the training camp either.

272
00:29:34,191 --> 00:29:36,557
They were absent from the last two meetings, too, Mr. Sethi.

273
00:29:37,161 --> 00:29:39,493
Seeing them Shah and Kapadiya are also planning something.

274
00:29:40,197 --> 00:29:42,392
You are very impatient, Babu Rao.

275
00:29:43,635 --> 00:29:45,603
They are staking their money us.

276
00:29:47,038 --> 00:29:50,530
You see, when a person invests money in a business..

277
00:29:51,643 --> 00:29:53,338
... he is worried about the safety of that money.

278
00:29:54,045 --> 00:29:56,575
Call them at our Madh Island bungalow today.

279
00:29:57,748 --> 00:29:59,375
I'll talk to them.

280
00:30:00,251 --> 00:30:02,742
Mr.Sethi, this election is no more the same.

281
00:30:02,987 --> 00:30:05,080
The torture of Dadabhai has changed the environment of the city.

282
00:30:05,323 --> 00:30:10,419
Mr. Patel is right. Many of our supporters have sided with dadabhai now.

283
00:30:10,561 --> 00:30:16,227
Yes, I've heard that. But you don't need worry so much.

284
00:30:16,467 --> 00:30:18,697
If we lose this election Mr.Sethi, all of us will be ruined.

285
00:30:19,170 --> 00:30:22,298
I say, we should find some suloution to dadabhai's hooliganism.

286
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,289
What should I do now?

287
00:30:24,709 --> 00:30:29,568
You are talking as if I were trying this for the first time.

288
00:30:30,848 --> 00:30:36,149
I understand the sync of elections and weapons.

289
00:30:36,955 --> 00:30:38,252
Babu Rao ...
- Yes?

290
00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:41,758
Check whether Kuti Baba has returned from Hyderabad.

291
00:30:41,858 --> 00:30:43,258
This is my rule.

292
00:30:43,893 --> 00:30:46,461
No cheating in the deal; no doubt in the work.

293
00:30:46,598 --> 00:30:48,766
What I want should be done.

294
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:52,160
The spot, time and type of murder..

295
00:30:52,407 --> 00:30:56,075
By type I mean, blind murder; no one will see it.

296
00:30:56,210 --> 00:30:58,378
Show murder: in front of the public.

297
00:30:58,578 --> 00:31:01,078
It'll be done as you want.

298
00:31:02,246 --> 00:31:05,779
Talking about the money, one lakh rupees for one person.

299
00:31:06,184 --> 00:31:08,652
I'll handle the consequent police problems.

300
00:31:08,753 --> 00:31:11,683
Massoud handles my money matters.

301
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:16,749
If one man of yours comes with the money, he'll not come again.

302
00:31:16,894 --> 00:31:19,121
But only this man of mine will deal with you.

303
00:31:19,897 --> 00:31:21,689
I want the information ...

304
00:31:21,933 --> 00:31:27,002
..of teh job we are to do 48 hours in advance.
That is 2 days.

305
00:31:27,469 --> 00:31:31,030
I will select the place and time where I want the money.

306
00:31:32,043 --> 00:31:37,678
Now talk to Mr. Sheti. I want an answer within 24 hours.

307
00:31:38,149 --> 00:31:42,212
If our deal is on, bring a 5 lakh rupees coconut.

308
00:31:42,712 --> 00:31:45,612
Coconut means the token amount of 5 lakh rupees.

309
00:31:45,812 --> 00:31:47,812
It should reach in my warehouse..

310
00:31:47,854 --> 00:31:51,361
..under the a Gita Press in the street behind Gandhi Chowk.

311
00:31:51,529 --> 00:31:55,820
When I get the money, I'll break the coconut.

312
00:31:55,967 --> 00:31:58,335
I mean I'll start my job.

313
00:31:59,535 --> 00:32:04,635
I got it. You want me to meet your father,
and talk to him about our marriage.

314
00:32:04,835 --> 00:32:07,835
Very good! Very good! Brilliant idea!

315
00:32:08,035 --> 00:32:12,535
But you are forgetting madam,
that your father is a police comissioner.

316
00:32:12,777 --> 00:32:15,741
And I'm just a student officer.

317
00:32:15,847 --> 00:32:17,815
I will be suspensed before I can get a job.

318
00:32:18,216 --> 00:32:19,642
No such thing will happen.

319
00:32:19,853 --> 00:32:24,744
Look, the plan is that you will come to my place
with the excuse of some department work.

320
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:27,988
When I see you, I will tell dad that I've met you before.

321
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,994
Then you can take the matter forward. Simple.

322
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:34,628
I can't take this risk. There's no risk in it.

323
00:32:34,933 --> 00:32:36,601
If you love, you have to have guts.

324
00:32:36,968 --> 00:32:40,603
You will have to come to my place tomorrow.
But with what excuse will I come, dear?

325
00:32:41,373 --> 00:32:49,066
Let's do this: meet Bade Babu tomorrow.
He'll send you at my place. Simple. - Ok.

326
00:32:51,766 --> 00:32:55,366
Sir! My name is Vijay Singh S. I. Trainee, batch number 26.

327
00:32:55,854 --> 00:32:58,152
Sir, Bade Babu has sent this diary for you.

328
00:33:00,461 --> 00:33:05,359
Sir! - What diary is this? - I asked for it daddy.

329
00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:08,590
It is Gayatri. I wanted to copy some dance notes.

330
00:33:09,568 --> 00:33:10,799
I see.

331
00:33:12,904 --> 00:33:15,868
Sit down, young man. Have tea. - All right, sir.
-Rendben uram!

332
00:33:16,274 --> 00:33:20,532
Sit down! - Sorry, sir.

333
00:33:22,881 --> 00:33:24,940
Ok, dad. I'll be off now. - Hey, you..

334
00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:28,950
..were going to have with me.
- My friends must be waiting for me.

335
00:33:29,287 --> 00:33:30,655
..And..don't now where Kanta puts my things.

336
00:33:30,923 --> 00:33:35,652
I never find anything.-What's the matter? Why do you look tensed?

337
00:33:35,898 --> 00:33:39,429
Sir! My name is Vijay Singh S. I. Trainee, batch number 26.

338
00:33:39,529 --> 00:33:43,329
I want a leave for a few days.- Why? Anything special?

339
00:33:43,468 --> 00:33:47,265
Well...I am going to be engaged, sir.

340
00:33:52,844 --> 00:33:54,812
Hey, weren't you in a hurry? What's the matter now?

341
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:57,948
I think I will drink tea with you, Dad.

342
00:34:00,252 --> 00:34:03,612
No problem; you'll get the leave. When is your engagement?

343
00:34:03,655 --> 00:34:08,123
Mother wrote me a letter asking the date.
Anyways, it'll be after Shraadh period.

344
00:34:08,126 --> 00:34:09,994
Get engaged soon.

345
00:34:10,262 --> 00:34:13,230
As it is, policemen get to marry with difficulty.

346
00:34:13,665 --> 00:34:15,895
I, too, had to remain bachelor for many days.

347
00:34:16,568 --> 00:34:17,660
All right.

348
00:34:22,741 --> 00:34:27,374
Hello!...- Father... father,  I calling from Bombay. I've started the job.

349
00:34:27,445 --> 00:34:30,710
I see. So, you're on duty? - Yes..

350
00:34:30,949 --> 00:34:34,418
You won't get a penny. What's this? 5 lakhs! 10 lakhs!

351
00:34:34,919 --> 00:34:35,886
Hey! Don't touch me!

352
00:34:36,087 --> 00:34:39,779
Hit me! C'mon, hit me!
Yes, hit me! C'mon, hit me!

353
00:34:39,858 --> 00:34:44,087
It is too much. - I'll take care of myself. You, too, take care.

354
00:34:44,463 --> 00:34:46,863
I am not going to give you guys anything. - Try and understand. - I don't care. Back off!

355
00:34:47,165 --> 00:34:50,492
Hurry up, brother. There's going to be trouble here.
- Dad, I'll call you later.

356
00:34:50,735 --> 00:34:53,101
I am not scared of you. Hit me..c'mon..

357
00:34:54,072 --> 00:34:56,040
What's the matter, brother? - What can it be?

358
00:34:56,341 --> 00:34:59,307
Whenever there's electoin, we are in trouble.

359
00:34:59,377 --> 00:35:01,174
They are Sethi's men; they must have asked for money.

360
00:35:01,413 --> 00:35:03,313
Tell me, dear, how long can one give money to them?

361
00:35:06,852 --> 00:35:09,679
Why are you running away?..- Stop!

362
00:35:09,854 --> 00:35:12,982
Murder me in front of the people. You will bring more fame to Mr. Sethi.

363
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:14,924
Please, calm down! - Just tell me!

364
00:35:15,393 --> 00:35:18,590
A man works hard for 10 long hours forgetting his family.

365
00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:21,228
For whom? For them?

366
00:35:21,366 --> 00:35:24,264
Please, calm down. Come with me; we'll register a report.

367
00:35:24,569 --> 00:35:27,835
You got a call for money. Did you launch a report? No, right?

368
00:35:27,939 --> 00:35:29,070
Did you come to the police station?

369
00:35:30,208 --> 00:35:33,677
Shouldn't you inform the police?
- Sir, it's true that he should inform the police.

370
00:35:33,712 --> 00:35:36,672
It's his minstake, but what's happened now is before you?

371
00:35:36,715 --> 00:35:39,843
Some goons got into his shop, and hit him on the head.
Please, reigster the complaint now.

372
00:35:40,118 --> 00:35:44,179
What's going on? What are you doing here?
Are you out of your senses?

373
00:35:45,157 --> 00:35:47,682
Father, Sethi's men broke in our shop, and..

374
00:35:48,059 --> 00:35:51,227
Why did you mess with them in the shop?
- You meanI should have offered them..

375
00:35:51,429 --> 00:35:54,857
..the earnings of our hard work like you do? - Get up!

376
00:35:54,866 --> 00:35:58,525
You think, you've grown up? You're arguing with me?
With your father?

377
00:36:01,005 --> 00:36:03,073
Sir, I hope you haven't registered anything.

378
00:36:03,241 --> 00:36:05,368
We have no complaint against anyone.

379
00:36:05,544 --> 00:36:07,512
But father, listen..- C'mon, get out of here.- Listen..

380
00:36:07,846 --> 00:36:10,406
And what is yours in that shop? It's my earning.

381
00:36:10,816 --> 00:36:13,410
And I will give my earning to whoever I wish. C'mon!

382
00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:19,710
Vijay Singh S. I. Trainee, batch number 26.

383
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:24,310
Sent here on field training for election duty only, ok?

384
00:36:26,131 --> 00:36:27,462
Mr. Bhosale has called you.

385
00:36:27,899 --> 00:36:31,391
Then? What happened next? Speak up!

386
00:36:32,003 --> 00:36:34,161
Sir, those men were hitting this man badly.

387
00:36:34,207 --> 00:36:38,275
And when I reached there..- I have a complete report of it.

388
00:36:39,010 --> 00:36:41,378
What were you doing in the Zaveri Market?

389
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:46,072
You were appointed at the police station number 7, right?

390
00:36:47,018 --> 00:36:52,178
This conflict occured at 10:30.
You were supposed to be at the police station at 9:30.

391
00:36:52,223 --> 00:36:55,483
Shouldn't you have been on duty? So?

392
00:36:59,783 --> 00:37:03,283
C'mon, answer me. - Sir, I had gone to call my father.

393
00:37:03,601 --> 00:37:06,001
Have you come here to attend someone's wedding?

394
00:37:06,638 --> 00:37:09,004
Remain in the police station you're appointed at.

395
00:37:09,374 --> 00:37:13,333
Do only what you're told. Got it?

396
00:37:14,145 --> 00:37:17,012
You don't know what's going on.
Or what might happen before the elections.

397
00:37:18,716 --> 00:37:21,685
If you wander about, you'll be killed. And then?

398
00:37:24,485 --> 00:37:25,885
Sorry, sir!

399
00:37:26,591 --> 00:37:29,958
Our senior, Sir Bhosale, says that..- What did he say?

400
00:37:30,862 --> 00:37:33,990
That everyone should be on the place of his duty, right?

401
00:37:35,033 --> 00:37:40,903
He is right. The positions, work and areas are divided among you.

402
00:37:40,906 --> 00:37:42,773
Bade Babu, I ...
- Vijay!

403
00:37:44,743 --> 00:37:46,711
This is the problem with you.

404
00:37:47,112 --> 00:37:54,178
That you don't listen to your seniors well. You are under training.

405
00:37:54,419 --> 00:37:56,787
You are to learn and understand a lot.

406
00:37:56,955 --> 00:38:00,515
A trainee should also have patience with enthusiasm.

407
00:38:08,366 --> 00:38:11,194
We are to learn and understand a lot. That's it!

408
00:38:11,703 --> 00:38:13,370
This is the only thing every senior officer says.

409
00:38:13,570 --> 00:38:18,370
Agree on every point. Salute them. That's our only duty.

410
00:38:18,944 --> 00:38:23,543
Discipline?! Mr. Bhosale was explaining me my duty,
while he was drunk himself!

411
00:38:24,048 --> 00:38:27,279
It's normal. The elections are approaching.

412
00:38:27,652 --> 00:38:30,378
Mr. Bhosle certainly a lot of pressure. It is probably swallowed one or two cups.

413
00:38:33,324 --> 00:38:39,126
Rana, Mr Bhosale says that anything can happen during the elections.

414
00:38:39,998 --> 00:38:41,966
We might also get killed.

415
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:47,963
So we should remain inside the police station like cowards.

416
00:38:48,608 --> 00:38:53,236
Wow! We are called here to hide ourselves
and not to protect the people.

417
00:38:53,945 --> 00:38:55,913
Vijay, why are you getting so upset?

418
00:38:56,615 --> 00:38:58,583
We are to stay here only 15 days.

419
00:38:59,618 --> 00:39:02,587
We will do what the department wants from us.

420
00:39:04,089 --> 00:39:06,057
What and how many people can we change?

421
00:39:06,725 --> 00:39:09,992
When it's the goons standing for the election
they can do anything to win.

422
00:39:10,192 --> 00:39:14,392
What have you throught? - What is there to think about?

423
00:39:14,399 --> 00:39:17,027
Our own men are not supporting our party.

424
00:39:17,636 --> 00:39:20,764
There's nothing divided between their union and our party.

425
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:25,076
You both pay homage to Siddhi Vinayak next morning..

426
00:39:25,677 --> 00:39:27,542
... and strengthen this tie.

427
00:39:29,581 --> 00:39:32,880
Mr. Shastri  I have 1 lakh 75 000 votes.

428
00:39:34,919 --> 00:39:39,982
You know what one has to do
to bring so many people under one union.

429
00:39:43,862 --> 00:39:47,559
I broke Anna's union by restarting the Gupta Mills.

430
00:39:50,602 --> 00:39:53,571
They opened fire on us and four of my men were killed.

431
00:39:57,208 --> 00:39:59,176
I got DSP Rabat transferred.

432
00:40:02,681 --> 00:40:04,945
Half a million.I had to spend half a million.

433
00:40:05,383 --> 00:40:08,078
Savant, just tell us how much you want from us.

434
00:40:09,952 --> 00:40:14,515
Dada, I will take 20 lakh rupees to support you.

435
00:40:16,694 --> 00:40:18,559
Two million?
- Only for you.

436
00:40:19,731 --> 00:40:22,996
It's a friend's offer to his friend.

437
00:40:23,635 --> 00:40:26,333
Look Sawant, on such occasions..
- Mr. Shastri !

438
00:40:28,433 --> 00:40:31,533
Sawant..

439
00:40:34,512 --> 00:40:36,375
... have you forgotten your old days?

440
00:40:39,484 --> 00:40:44,387
Don't you remember the time,
when I saved your prestige in front of Anna?

441
00:40:45,723 --> 00:40:46,621
You don't remember, right?

442
00:40:46,792 --> 00:40:53,022
And today... your status has become worth 20 lakhs? 20 lakhs?

443
00:40:54,832 --> 00:40:56,595
I know what my standing is.

444
00:40:57,835 --> 00:40:59,803
I was sitting here for our friendship.

445
00:41:00,772 --> 00:41:04,037
Otherwise, Sawant does not have time to talk to anyone.

446
00:41:07,078 --> 00:41:09,046
Everyone know where Sawant lives.

447
00:41:10,148 --> 00:41:14,050
You made the matter worse. We could have got him for 10 lakhs.

448
00:41:14,252 --> 00:41:16,720
Shastri! What would I do? Beg to him?

449
00:41:19,157 --> 00:41:21,648
20 lakhs is not zoo much to get him.

450
00:41:22,093 --> 00:41:24,391
I told that to Raja Saab. Ask him.

451
00:41:25,096 --> 00:41:26,996
But now? Where did the money come from?

452
00:41:29,033 --> 00:41:32,002
Come along.. we'll somehow go and arrange for money.

453
00:41:32,503 --> 00:41:34,471
Will Raatan Sethi miss this chance? He will pound on it.

454
00:41:35,039 --> 00:41:36,267
Részesülni fog belõle!

455
00:41:52,056 --> 00:41:56,516
Hey  Sawant, how are you?
- Mr. Sethi! How come you arrived so soon?

456
00:41:57,061 --> 00:42:01,330
Everything okay?
- Actually I was going to receive you. Sorry.

457
00:42:01,566 --> 00:42:02,533
- Ma.

458
00:42:06,204 --> 00:42:09,971
Do not act like a child. You should not do this.

459
00:42:10,241 --> 00:42:12,609
What? Everything is in our mother's blessing.

460
00:42:12,677 --> 00:42:16,374
Our blessing is alwys with you my child.
- What is it?

461
00:42:17,348 --> 00:42:21,779
It's our good luck that you came to our place.

462
00:42:29,627 --> 00:42:32,596
If you call me brother, I'd like it.

463
00:42:41,039 --> 00:42:43,900
Well? What is your name?

464
00:42:44,642 --> 00:42:47,042
Say your name, son.
- Sameer.

465
00:42:48,713 --> 00:42:50,180
Very cute child,Sawant!

466
00:42:52,350 --> 00:42:54,215
Is that your father's photo?

467
00:42:55,653 --> 00:42:56,779
Yes.

468
00:43:08,099 --> 00:43:10,966
Sawant, I am surprised that you asked 20 lakh rupees from me.

469
00:43:11,836 --> 00:43:15,101
I mean I had gauged your price to be more than that.

470
00:43:16,274 --> 00:43:18,640
Sawant, let the news of our joining hands get public.

471
00:43:19,377 --> 00:43:23,643
Tell me when and how you want the money. You'll get it.

472
00:43:33,625 --> 00:43:38,084
I didn't get Mr. Sethi. Why do you want to get Sawant killed?

473
00:43:38,630 --> 00:43:41,958
He's supporting you, isn't he?- When will you learn Babu Rao?

474
00:43:43,034 --> 00:43:47,596
Sometimes one has to kill one's own supporters in politics.

475
00:43:49,641 --> 00:43:55,739
To make this election inour favor, Sawant will have to go.

476
00:44:00,018 --> 00:44:06,617
Mr. Sethi, Sawant's price is 20 lakhs rupees. I'll take 10 lakhs to kill him.

477
00:44:07,025 --> 00:44:10,858
What? I can understand. 2 lakhs for 1 lakh..

478
00:44:11,696 --> 00:44:14,893
This 10 lakh is not for killing Sawant; it's season rate.

479
00:44:15,667 --> 00:44:20,127
It is like the orchestra's time to earn is the wedding season.

480
00:44:20,772 --> 00:44:23,240
The time for goons to earn is the election season.

481
00:44:24,175 --> 00:44:27,144
Does one let go of such opportunities?
- You're going back on your word.

482
00:44:27,612 --> 00:44:30,080
Babu Rao, you get excited too soon.

483
00:44:31,950 --> 00:44:33,918
Mr. Rao does not understand.

484
00:44:35,353 --> 00:44:38,015
One gets only rusted weapons for less money.

485
00:44:39,290 --> 00:44:43,659
What you said shall be done.
We understand the importance of this task.

486
00:44:44,696 --> 00:44:47,187
Forget all this; first do what is important.

487
00:44:47,632 --> 00:44:49,600
We're running short of time, Babu Rao.

488
00:44:50,034 --> 00:44:51,934
Arrange for the money quickly. - Yes.

489
00:44:52,203 --> 00:44:55,001
If you can't get 10 lakhs from one person,
find 5 people who can give 2 lakhs each.

490
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:57,005
Do it by any means - It'll be done. - Ok.

491
00:44:57,205 --> 00:45:02,705
Yes. Stop here. Yes, fine. Give me.

492
00:45:08,186 --> 00:45:12,623
The spot to kill Sawant should be 1 km. away from Nana Chowk.

493
00:45:13,858 --> 00:45:18,454
After the job is done you will leave by the back road.

494
00:45:19,664 --> 00:45:22,963
A new police station is inauguruted at  Vitthalwadiban, right?

495
00:45:23,668 --> 00:45:25,568
A new station means new officers.

496
00:45:26,004 --> 00:45:31,464
What happens to one officer happens to the full department.

497
00:45:32,610 --> 00:45:37,578
Decide the spot after talking to Shyam at the warehouse

498
00:45:38,616 --> 00:45:42,313
Mr. Sawant is going to pass by Teen Batin at 11 a.m. tomorrow.

499
00:45:43,655 --> 00:45:45,623
Mr. Sawant, you've always opposed to Mr. Sethi.

500
00:45:46,024 --> 00:45:47,924
Then why are you supporting him in this election?

501
00:45:48,059 --> 00:45:51,084
It's about having similar thoughts.
We didn't have till a few months back.

502
00:45:52,030 --> 00:45:54,999
Besides, I believe that the work should be done for the public,

503
00:45:55,633 --> 00:46:00,865
..for the nation. No matter who we do it with.

504
00:46:00,938 --> 00:46:06,002
Mr Sawant, seeing the situation of the city,
every leader has appointed a security guard.

505
00:46:06,077 --> 00:46:09,877
But, you ...- I know hooliganism has increased now.

506
00:46:11,649 --> 00:46:13,879
But not so much that someone might shoot Sawant.

507
00:46:21,893 --> 00:46:23,622
Move! Move!

508
00:46:52,290 --> 00:46:54,121
Where is your duty for today?

509
00:46:54,926 --> 00:46:57,156
Don't konow. I have to report to the General Headquarters in two hours today.

510
00:47:19,083 --> 00:47:21,051
Stop.
- What is it?

511
00:47:21,819 --> 00:47:23,787
Follow that car! Move.

512
00:47:32,597 --> 00:47:33,894
Take left, left.

513
00:47:47,211 --> 00:47:49,577
Mr. Savant was killed near checkpoint Chembur.

514
00:47:50,114 --> 00:47:53,242
They've killed a policeman near the police station no7.

515
00:47:53,951 --> 00:47:55,919
It was Vijay appointed at station number 7.

516
00:48:31,989 --> 00:48:33,581
Stop! Stop!

517
00:50:00,214 --> 00:50:01,114
Raghuvanshi?

518
00:50:03,714 --> 00:50:06,079
Rana! Inspector Raghuvanshi!

519
00:50:07,051 --> 00:50:08,814
I had met him at the Zaveri Market police station.

520
00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:14,253
He was with those murderers.
- Vijay! C'mon..-No but.. - C'mon.

521
00:50:15,626 --> 00:50:19,027
Let's go from here ... Don't say anything. - Listen.

522
00:50:19,630 --> 00:50:24,499
Nothing's happened. You have seen nothing.
Just come with us. Let's go.

523
00:50:25,870 --> 00:50:28,771
Yes, I shot him because he was one of those murderers.

524
00:50:29,006 --> 00:50:31,169
What would I do? Let him go?

525
00:50:31,369 --> 00:50:34,069
- Well, he was a murderer and you shot him. Fine?

526
00:50:34,378 --> 00:50:35,909
It's not about  Raghuvanshi,Vijay!

527
00:50:36,109 --> 00:50:38,209
Four people are killed in this shootout.

528
00:50:38,249 --> 00:50:40,774
These people were running away after killing
the workers leader, Sawant.

529
00:50:42,820 --> 00:50:46,950
The traffic constable they killed was after them  from Chembur.

530
00:50:47,858 --> 00:50:50,224
And this Sawant was supporting Raatan Sethi.

531
00:50:52,029 --> 00:50:53,997
That news was in the papers.

532
00:50:55,266 --> 00:50:57,097
I think this is all a political game.

533
00:50:59,370 --> 00:51:01,235
We must think very carefully before taking any step.

534
00:51:01,472 --> 00:51:03,440
Why do we need to take any step at all?

535
00:51:04,842 --> 00:51:08,243
Vijay, were you appointed at that police station? - No.

536
00:51:08,679 --> 00:51:10,977
That's it! You were not anywhere in this sootout.

537
00:51:11,349 --> 00:51:15,183
It's a future matter if some witness turns up
who saw you shooting Raghuvanshi.

538
00:51:19,890 --> 00:51:23,326
Rana is right. No one comes up as a witness to such cases.

539
00:51:24,328 --> 00:51:26,592
But is there his signature on duty register of any station?

540
00:51:27,965 --> 00:51:29,933
What will he answer? -He has the answer.

541
00:51:30,368 --> 00:51:34,599
That he wasn't doing his duty but was involved in the shootout.

542
00:51:34,672 --> 00:51:37,869
Bade Babu  ...
- Don't say a wordI Just listen!

543
00:51:38,976 --> 00:51:43,106
I have market your duty in station no.13 in the legal register.

544
00:51:43,781 --> 00:51:49,616
You were with inspector Solanki on a raid during these four hours. Yes!

545
00:51:57,194 --> 00:52:01,628
Vijay, I will get you out of this trap. Just brace yourself.

546
00:52:01,665 --> 00:52:04,156
I see the ghost of honesty and duty haunting you.

547
00:52:12,476 --> 00:52:15,639
Till there are sun and moon in the sky Sawant, you will be remembered!

548
00:52:15,839 --> 00:52:19,839
Till there are sun and moon in the sky Sawant, you will be remembered!

549
00:52:29,794 --> 00:52:30,988
Sister!

550
00:52:33,631 --> 00:52:35,599
Please, brace yourself.

551
00:52:38,102 --> 00:52:43,597
We can't do anything except bearing this grief.

552
00:52:44,175 --> 00:52:46,939
Mother, look what he has done?

553
00:52:47,912 --> 00:52:50,278
Take her inside.

554
00:52:53,084 --> 00:52:57,509
No! Let go of me! Let go!

555
00:52:58,909 --> 00:53:06,809
Please... - Come..come sister... please. Brace ypourself.

556
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:17,371
Stop,Dada!

557
00:53:18,876 --> 00:53:20,642
Don't you dare touch our brother!

558
00:53:20,842 --> 00:53:23,142
We won't tolerate your drama anymore.

559
00:53:23,214 --> 00:53:26,740
You got brother killed, and now you've come to express grief?

560
00:53:26,817 --> 00:53:28,250
Hey brother!

561
00:53:28,953 --> 00:53:33,820
Pal, this is not appropiate at such an occasion.

562
00:53:33,925 --> 00:53:38,454
This is not right. - Not right? Mr. Sethi we are furious.

563
00:53:38,629 --> 00:53:42,988
We've lost our brother. He got Sawant killed.

564
00:53:43,067 --> 00:53:45,197
And now he's come to offer flowers on his dead body.

565
00:53:47,972 --> 00:53:55,535
Chaudhari ...Chaudhari, I understand your grief.

566
00:53:56,647 --> 00:54:02,608
But what you're doing on this occasions in sot god.

567
00:54:04,822 --> 00:54:12,528
The relationships, friendships, enmity,
it all survives till the person is alive.

568
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:24,263
Chaudhari. Sawant is no more.
It's only a body of flesh and bones. Dead body!

569
00:54:24,307 --> 00:54:31,514
We shouldn't stop anyone from offering flowers to a body.

570
00:54:34,185 --> 00:54:35,584
Come, Dabadhai! Come!

571
00:54:58,642 --> 00:55:01,611
Till there are sun and moon in the sky Sawant, you will be remembered!

572
00:55:10,888 --> 00:55:16,121
You've played a big game Sethi!. ... By getting Sawant killed..

573
00:55:17,461 --> 00:55:19,952
... you got  1,50 votes in your pocket.

574
00:55:21,098 --> 00:55:22,190
1,50 lakhs?

575
00:55:25,936 --> 00:55:28,063
1,75 lakhs!

576
00:55:29,773 --> 00:55:35,575
Dadabhai, if your party had some sense ...

577
00:55:36,914 --> 00:55:38,814
... it wouldn't make you stand against me.

578
00:55:42,953 --> 00:55:45,922
At least you wouldn't have to face this defeat.

579
00:55:46,890 --> 00:55:51,559
This is very regrettable. The goons have become so courageous..

580
00:55:52,196 --> 00:55:56,832
... that they kill anyone, anytime, anywhere.

581
00:55:57,635 --> 00:56:01,571
They don't fear our department at all now.

582
00:56:01,639 --> 00:56:05,108
Sir! Sawant  was supporting  Raatan Sethi for this election..

583
00:56:05,909 --> 00:56:09,477
So possibly Dada got him ... - Mr. Tande!

584
00:56:09,512 --> 00:56:11,274
The investigation is still now.

585
00:56:11,649 --> 00:56:13,817
We can't blame anyone for Sawant's death yet.

586
00:56:14,051 --> 00:56:18,181
So Mr.Tande? I hope you're allright.

587
00:56:19,056 --> 00:56:21,188
Did you had a fight with your Wife last night? - No.

588
00:56:22,660 --> 00:56:26,423
Think before you speak anything or about anyone.

589
00:56:26,597 --> 00:56:28,030
Yes, sir.

590
00:56:30,067 --> 00:56:32,558
Mr. Bhosale, you're in charge of this case.

591
00:56:33,604 --> 00:56:36,573
Please, choose the officers you'd need with you.

592
00:56:37,007 --> 00:56:41,509
But I want to see progress very soon.
Because I am leaving for Delhi tomorrow.

593
00:56:42,212 --> 00:56:46,743
We gets calls from there any moment.
They don't care about our problems.

594
00:56:47,084 --> 00:56:50,075
There will be inquiries about Sawant case over there.

595
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:52,088
Daddy, you're taking this file aren't you? - Yes, dear.

596
00:56:52,623 --> 00:56:54,591
I've put your medicines in the bag.

597
00:56:54,792 --> 00:56:59,253
You're very careless about medicines.
So I've told Gupta to remind you.

598
00:56:59,330 --> 00:57:01,594
And I've also told him to report me when he returns.

599
00:57:02,399 --> 00:57:06,267
Really? And what if you don't get the right reports?

600
00:57:07,638 --> 00:57:10,038
Then, as a punishment ...

601
00:57:10,741 --> 00:57:13,073
... you won't get cabbage Parathas.

602
00:57:13,644 --> 00:57:15,612
There won't be any ghee seasoning in Dal.

603
00:57:15,979 --> 00:57:17,879
These punishments will go togheter.

604
00:57:18,115 --> 00:57:20,083
Ok, I agree to that.

605
00:57:20,818 --> 00:57:25,118
But I hope you've copied the dance notes.

606
00:57:25,589 --> 00:57:27,113
The diary.

607
00:57:29,493 --> 00:57:34,053
Tell Bade Babu to grant Vijay the leave he wants.

608
00:57:34,665 --> 00:57:36,223
For this engagement.

609
00:57:41,605 --> 00:57:43,573
I also keep my eyes open.

610
00:57:45,609 --> 00:57:47,577
By the way, the guy is good.

611
00:57:53,677 --> 00:57:54,777
Daddy!

612
00:57:54,785 --> 00:57:57,253
If Raghuvanshi shot the constable ...

613
00:57:57,955 --> 00:57:59,923
..who shot Raghuvanshi?

614
00:58:00,891 --> 00:58:04,324
There must be one more guy with the gun in this case.

615
00:58:05,295 --> 00:58:07,593
There is always one Arjun who protest in all Mahabharata.

616
00:58:09,233 --> 00:58:12,100
I don't want any Arjun in my Mahabharata.

617
00:58:27,852 --> 00:58:32,854
Hello. Look..can I talk to Mr. Pandey?
- What are you doing?

618
00:58:32,923 --> 00:58:34,550
Bade Babu ...- I don't want to hear anything.

619
00:58:34,858 --> 00:58:37,088
Please, listen! - You've gone mad.

620
00:58:37,594 --> 00:58:39,688
Your brain has stopped working.

621
00:58:39,731 --> 00:58:42,899
You think no one in department will know
if you tell about this matter to Pandey?

622
00:58:43,133 --> 00:58:48,093
This Sawant case has become the factor of Sethi's victory or loss.

623
00:58:48,939 --> 00:58:52,898
Whoever in our department works for him
are keeping their eyes and ears open.

624
00:58:53,377 --> 00:58:55,106
They're looking for clues.

625
00:58:55,279 --> 00:58:58,648
If they get the slightest hint that
you're involved in this,..

626
00:58:58,682 --> 00:59:00,240
... you'll be crushed.

627
00:59:00,651 --> 00:59:02,846
And who are you anyways? Who are you?

628
00:59:03,620 --> 00:59:05,588
The commissioner himself does not want to open this case.

629
00:59:06,089 --> 00:59:09,180
Who likes to create unnecessary trouble?

630
00:59:09,226 --> 00:59:12,995
That's why a man like Bhosale is given the charge of this case.

631
00:59:13,063 --> 00:59:16,332
Bhosalé!  He's a master in suppressing such cases.

632
00:59:16,701 --> 00:59:20,531
This is nothing. The big players of this game are very reputed people.

633
00:59:20,637 --> 00:59:23,605
And you talk of conscience and truth?

634
01:00:18,128 --> 01:00:20,596
Is Mr. Bhosale here? - Who are you?

635
01:00:27,638 --> 01:00:30,072
Sir, Mr. Bhosale is attending a party at  Mr.Sethi's place.

636
01:00:36,438 --> 01:00:39,006
This is not good, Mr. Sethi!

637
01:00:39,441 --> 01:00:43,572
This is how you behave with a truthful journalist?

638
01:00:43,647 --> 01:00:48,075
This is not good. -  C'mon, go out. - This is hooliganism.

639
01:00:48,516 --> 01:00:52,418
C'mon, take your camera. Nothing happened. Go out.

640
01:00:52,887 --> 01:00:54,411
C'mon. Come.

641
01:00:55,056 --> 01:00:59,023
You reporters don't understand anything.
You barge anywhere you want to.

642
01:00:59,461 --> 01:01:01,429
Why did you need to come here?

643
01:01:02,130 --> 01:01:04,098
It's a private party of Mr. Sethi.

644
01:01:04,466 --> 01:01:06,627
What wrong did I ask him?

645
01:01:07,102 --> 01:01:11,761
Only that will he benefit or lose by Sawant's death in this election.

646
01:01:11,973 --> 01:01:14,642
But  Mr. Sethi thrashed me for this trifle matter.

647
01:01:15,543 --> 01:01:21,840
It's okay ... nothing has happened. true journalist never cries.

648
01:01:22,083 --> 01:01:24,951
He should only protest. Come.

649
01:01:26,053 --> 01:01:28,021
What is your name?
- Shanti Kumar.

650
01:01:28,389 --> 01:01:30,289
Where do you live?
- Azad Nagar.

651
01:01:31,726 --> 01:01:34,286
I know the rest of your story. Your father was a school teacher.

652
01:01:35,263 --> 01:01:37,231
Your grandfather was a freedom fighter.

653
01:01:37,432 --> 01:01:39,696
C'mon, I'll drop you to Azad Nagar. Come on.

654
01:01:39,896 --> 01:01:42,896
That rascal press man!

655
01:01:43,096 --> 01:01:45,596
Don't worry;I'am all right. - Sir.

656
01:01:45,740 --> 01:01:50,008
Who had invited him? Tell me.

657
01:01:50,208 --> 01:01:52,408
Who called him?

658
01:01:52,447 --> 01:01:57,317
Came to find a scandal here

659
01:01:57,517 --> 01:02:01,717
Came to cretae panic.

660
01:02:01,917 --> 01:02:07,617
This is.. this is bloody Raatan Sethi's empire.
- Yes, sir. You are right.

661
01:02:07,717 --> 01:02:10,317
No body can talk. - Yes, sir.

662
01:02:10,417 --> 01:02:16,017
Laugh or cry unless I wish. - Yes, sir.

663
01:02:17,717 --> 01:02:20,917
I am Raatan Sethi!

664
01:02:22,443 --> 01:02:23,410
Constable!

665
01:02:24,779 --> 01:02:26,679
Take the sandal.

666
01:02:28,716 --> 01:02:30,684
Take the sandal.

667
01:02:34,789 --> 01:02:36,256
Take it.

668
01:02:42,730 --> 01:02:45,028
If you don't care about your dignity, it's ok.

669
01:02:46,734 --> 01:02:49,525
At least care for this uniform you are wearing.

670
01:02:49,770 --> 01:02:51,203
Who..who is it?

671
01:03:02,950 --> 01:03:07,978
I've come like an uninvited guest. I've heard a lot about you.

672
01:03:09,557 --> 01:03:12,287
The candidate of Jan Seva Mandal ..

673
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:14,159
..Raatan Sethi!

674
01:03:16,330 --> 01:03:20,289
Your bandits stir this city.

675
01:03:26,707 --> 01:03:30,268
My name is Vijay Singh S. I. Trainee, batch number 26.

676
01:03:31,145 --> 01:03:32,737
Working on election security.

677
01:03:33,637 --> 01:03:40,637
V..I..J..A..Y..

678
01:03:44,525 --> 01:03:47,658
Yes, remember that name.

679
01:03:48,729 --> 01:03:51,697
Because this name will change your fate.

680
01:04:11,852 --> 01:04:14,082
Student officers.

681
01:04:16,090 --> 01:04:21,289
It won't be wise to mess with him at

682
01:04:21,896 --> 01:04:24,421
A heard a women screaming when I was passing the road.

683
01:04:24,865 --> 01:04:28,062
A thief was snatching the gold chain of that woman.

684
01:04:28,436 --> 01:04:31,337
I got yery angry. I caught him and slapped across his face.

685
01:04:31,939 --> 01:04:33,668
How dare you steal from a woman!

686
01:04:35,376 --> 01:04:38,072
Good the public came up. You know how my anger is.

687
01:04:38,512 --> 01:04:40,104
Yes, yes, enough!

688
01:04:40,481 --> 01:04:44,918
You think you've done a great job just
because you caught a small thief and slapped him?

689
01:04:45,720 --> 01:04:49,185
And look at this shirt! Shucks! How did you blot it? Take it off!

690
01:04:49,290 --> 01:04:54,352
What are you doing, Roma?
- I'll wash it; c'mon take it off! - Roma!

691
01:04:54,426 --> 01:04:57,261
It'll take me only two minutes to wash it;it'll dry soon.

692
01:05:06,247 --> 01:05:12,647
"Don't know what effect your face has."

693
01:05:13,047 --> 01:05:19,541
"Don't know what effect your face has."

694
01:05:20,087 --> 01:05:26,947
"I can't take my eyes off since the time I saw it."

695
01:05:27,301 --> 01:05:40,870
"Don't know what effect your face has
Don't know what effect your face has."

696
01:05:40,975 --> 01:05:47,603
"I can't take my eyes off since the time I saw it."

697
01:05:48,003 --> 01:05:54,403
"Don't know what effect your face has."

698
01:06:18,879 --> 01:06:25,939
"The flowers, moon and stars are the hues of your beauty."

699
01:06:26,020 --> 01:06:32,755
"My darling, there can be no lever like you. "

700
01:06:32,827 --> 01:06:35,955
"You're the prettiest, You're most youthful."

701
01:06:36,363 --> 01:06:39,855
"You don't know that."

702
01:06:40,341 --> 01:06:47,208
"Your grace can make anyone go crazy."

703
01:06:47,408 --> 01:06:54,108
"Your grace can make anyone go crazy."

704
01:06:54,348 --> 01:07:00,381
"I can't take my eyes off since the time I saw it."

705
01:07:01,122 --> 01:07:08,248
"Don't know what effect your face has."

706
01:07:35,723 --> 01:07:42,617
"Only the lovers know why they go crazy in love."

707
01:07:42,730 --> 01:07:49,690
"My heart is always restless. What madness is this?"

708
01:07:49,703 --> 01:07:52,900
"I talk about you. I meet you."

709
01:07:53,274 --> 01:07:56,675
"You don' know how much I love you."

710
01:07:56,875 --> 01:08:03,675
"You are unconscious; I too, I'm unaware."

711
01:08:04,185 --> 01:08:10,915
"You are unconscious; I too, I'm unaware."

712
01:08:11,058 --> 01:08:17,686
"I can't take my eyes off since the time I saw it."

713
01:08:18,132 --> 01:08:24,799
"Don't know what effect your face has."

714
01:08:33,681 --> 01:08:37,672
C'mon, Mr Bhosale is calling you. - Don't tiuch! I'm coming.

715
01:08:37,717 --> 01:08:39,241
Come.

716
01:08:45,192 --> 01:08:48,650
That's the same question I want to ask you.
What were you doing there?

717
01:08:49,196 --> 01:08:53,064
Honest police officers are killed on the roads
and there's no trace of their killers.

718
01:08:53,434 --> 01:08:54,992
How would we find any trace?

719
01:08:55,336 --> 01:08:58,271
Because you serve those people who do these deeds.

720
01:08:58,706 --> 01:09:01,937
You drink with them.
- Are you out of your mind?

721
01:09:02,309 --> 01:09:05,210
No, I'm quite in my senses. I'm totally sane.

722
01:09:05,713 --> 01:09:08,273
Have your parents got you in the police department to die?

723
01:09:08,716 --> 01:09:09,683
No!

724
01:09:10,451 --> 01:09:12,681
To do good to officers like you.

725
01:09:12,888 --> 01:09:17,082
Shinde! Take him away! - I will teach you a lesson. - Take him!

726
01:09:17,458 --> 01:09:20,786
Take him! -
Remember; I will get this area under my control.

727
01:09:20,995 --> 01:09:24,226
Bhosale! You're teaching me my duty.

728
01:09:24,732 --> 01:09:28,065
I'll tell you what duty is.

729
01:09:28,435 --> 01:09:30,903
I'll give you a few lessons!
-  Be damned!

730
01:09:31,672 --> 01:09:35,802
C'mon, go home and rest. Go home.

731
01:09:36,377 --> 01:09:38,208
Come here.. come..

732
01:09:38,679 --> 01:09:42,843
Hold him! - You cannot harm me. - Hold his neck!

733
01:09:43,052 --> 01:09:48,350
Grab his head! You rascal! Scoundrel!

734
01:09:48,524 --> 01:09:53,960
Here it comes. Explaining my duty, eh?

735
01:09:54,061 --> 01:09:57,559
I am not here to attend anyone's wedding.
But I'll attend yours.

736
01:09:57,698 --> 01:10:00,860
I'll explain you your duty, you rascal! Bhosale!

737
01:10:05,841 --> 01:10:08,830
Here.. take his.. - Stop!

738
01:10:12,212 --> 01:10:14,679
What is it Bhosale?

739
01:10:14,779 --> 01:10:16,579
What is this going on? You know this is the headquarter.

740
01:10:16,884 --> 01:10:20,183
Don't explain that to me. Explain your trainee,..

741
01:10:20,721 --> 01:10:23,281
..who's behaving so with his senior.

742
01:10:23,724 --> 01:10:27,983
He dares question me.
- I'll find out what the truth is.

743
01:10:30,130 --> 01:10:32,291
C'mon Vijay. Come on.

744
01:10:37,738 --> 01:10:38,864
What are you looking at? Go!

745
01:10:43,777 --> 01:10:44,869
Look, Vijay ...

746
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:48,448
... we will have to supress this matter for now.

747
01:10:48,916 --> 01:10:53,012
You won't get emotional and speak out.
Or the matter will get worse.

748
01:10:55,356 --> 01:10:58,917
That we lost two police officers does not mean much.

749
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:03,218
But that a police officer was involved
in the Sawant murder case..

750
01:11:04,431 --> 01:11:09,198
..means a lot.. The press is always hunting for such news.

751
01:11:10,504 --> 01:11:13,132
Raatan Sethi will take advantage of this situation.

752
01:11:13,907 --> 01:11:15,932
He will use this news as a weapon..

753
01:11:16,910 --> 01:11:20,971
..and will transfer our officers who do good work here.

754
01:11:22,950 --> 01:11:27,751
Please, trust me. I will fully look into this matter.

755
01:11:28,422 --> 01:11:33,291
And it will be proved at the right time  that Raghuvanshi

756
01:11:33,827 --> 01:11:35,988
..did not die a marty, but a criminal.

757
01:11:37,464 --> 01:11:40,695
Mr. Sethi, I will teach him a good lesson.

758
01:11:41,902 --> 01:11:44,302
I need some time to make up a trap for Vijay.

759
01:11:46,440 --> 01:11:50,206
Mr. Choudhori is preparing, to hand the Sawant case to  Pandey.

760
01:11:50,744 --> 01:11:53,736
If anything happens to Vijay now, I might lose my job.

761
01:11:54,448 --> 01:11:59,215
Why does this soldier want to lose his life for honesty?

762
01:11:59,753 --> 01:12:03,714
This cop just saw two of his other people died in the street.

763
01:12:04,792 --> 01:12:09,229
When our men fired policeman from post seven ...

764
01:12:09,797 --> 01:12:13,432
... Constable Harry Singh was present there, Vijay was also there.

765
01:12:15,102 --> 01:12:17,832
They followed our men.

766
01:12:18,772 --> 01:12:22,105
At some distance from the station Raghuvanshi fell out of the car.

767
01:12:22,509 --> 01:12:26,275
Then these two officers surrounded Raghuvanshi in the Kalina.

768
01:12:27,114 --> 01:12:31,278
Raghuvanshi shot Hari Singh there and Vijay shot him.

769
01:12:34,955 --> 01:12:40,154
Before the matter gets further, we should do away with him.

770
01:12:41,728 --> 01:12:44,959
We do not need your weapon to do away with him, Kutti..

771
01:12:46,733 --> 01:12:50,134
He's trapped in the noose of law himself.

772
01:12:52,406 --> 01:12:57,343
Bhosle, the noose is ready. You are only to tighten the knot.

773
01:13:31,411 --> 01:13:34,403
Hey! This is Vijay. And the police are following him.

774
01:13:41,755 --> 01:13:43,416
What's this going on here?

775
01:13:44,391 --> 01:13:45,016
What has he done?

776
01:13:45,325 --> 01:13:46,349
What are the two doing here?

777
01:13:46,860 --> 01:13:48,851
What are you doing?

778
01:13:49,329 --> 01:13:51,320
Vijay, what happened?

779
01:14:10,417 --> 01:14:13,045
Listen to me This is not right.

780
01:14:13,453 --> 01:14:15,814
Listen to me. - You leave me.

781
01:14:27,367 --> 01:14:29,995
Let me go! - Get out of here! Forget Vijay.

782
01:14:30,370 --> 01:14:33,237
Quite seriously. Go away, forget Vijay.

783
01:14:37,478 --> 01:14:39,445
You rascal! Bhosale!

784
01:14:40,581 --> 01:14:42,339
Take him!

785
01:15:09,443 --> 01:15:13,038
Student Police Officer Academy killed two of his own colleagues.

786
01:15:13,747 --> 01:15:18,081
This man Vijay Singh snatched the gun of a senior officer ...

787
01:15:18,452 --> 01:15:20,784
... and shot another police officers on duty.

788
01:15:21,154 --> 01:15:23,247
Two policemen are killed in this incident.

789
01:15:23,757 --> 01:15:26,920
The police officers say that Vijay Singh is habituated to drugs.

790
01:15:27,294 --> 01:15:31,253
It is said that he might also be involved
in the in the Sawant murder case.

791
01:15:32,733 --> 01:15:35,167
What are you doing? Let them!

792
01:15:36,003 --> 01:15:39,996
What is this going on? Why are you my son's things?

793
01:15:40,374 --> 01:15:42,001
Where is my son?

794
01:15:42,409 --> 01:15:45,901
What is this you're doing? What has he done?

795
01:15:46,713 --> 01:15:50,376
What crime has he done? - He takes drugs. He's murdered someone.

796
01:15:50,917 --> 01:15:55,354
My son can never do that. Something wrong is happening with him.

797
01:15:56,356 --> 01:15:58,324
He can never murder.

798
01:16:00,260 --> 01:16:02,228
It is you who look like a murdered!

799
01:16:03,230 --> 01:16:08,930
Do you think I'll easily believe that my son has killed some on?

800
01:16:11,438 --> 01:16:14,373
Brother! Did you hear that?

801
01:16:15,409 --> 01:16:18,776
They says that my Vijay takes drugs.

802
01:16:19,546 --> 01:16:21,514
That he's murdered.

803
01:16:22,749 --> 01:16:26,708
Can this be true? It was you who got him into police force.

804
01:16:27,321 --> 01:16:30,749
How can he be a murderer? Tell me!

805
01:16:31,692 --> 01:16:33,751
Hey! Where are you taking his things?

806
01:17:02,389 --> 01:17:04,357
What happened, sir? You were going to tell me.

807
01:17:05,058 --> 01:17:08,118
Where is my son? Why am I not allowed to meet him?

808
01:17:08,762 --> 01:17:12,220
You said you were going to talk to Mr. Pandey. Did you?

809
01:17:12,733 --> 01:17:17,432
Mr Singh, I'm trying for that.  Please, have patience.

810
01:17:18,038 --> 01:17:20,939
Have patience? What are you talking, sir?

811
01:17:21,475 --> 01:17:25,844
I am his father. Can anyone imagine what I'm going through?

812
01:17:26,380 --> 01:17:31,079
It's been 7 hours since I'm in this city,
but I'm not getting the right information.

813
01:17:33,687 --> 01:17:38,215
Sir, I request you. Please let me meet my son only once.

814
01:17:38,725 --> 01:17:42,661
Do you think it is easy? Do you know what Vijay is charged with?

815
01:17:43,430 --> 01:17:45,796
Even Mr Pandey hasn't been able to meet him.

816
01:17:46,700 --> 01:17:50,067
He also needs special permission to meet him.

817
01:17:54,374 --> 01:17:55,671
Vijay ...

818
01:17:56,710 --> 01:18:01,841
... I understand well, what your charge-sheet is and what truth is.

819
01:18:03,483 --> 01:18:06,111
And this truth ...- Do not talk about truth, sir.

820
01:18:06,820 --> 01:18:08,310
Please, do not talk of the truth.

821
01:18:08,755 --> 01:18:11,087
Your truth has changed my life.

822
01:18:11,858 --> 01:18:15,021
If you hadn't taught me the lessons of truth,
I would not be here today.

823
01:18:16,897 --> 01:18:19,229
The truth which glorify the academy ...

824
01:18:19,733 --> 01:18:22,224
... here it falls to his knees at every turn, to lie.

825
01:18:22,736 --> 01:18:23,703
Damn true!

826
01:18:24,137 --> 01:18:26,463
Training is not what you thaught us at the school.

827
01:18:26,563 --> 01:18:29,863
Our training starts where officers like Bhosale..

828
01:18:29,874 --> 01:18:31,201
... teach us to walk on the path of dishonesty.

829
01:18:31,678 --> 01:18:35,205
He teaches us how to serve the goons. That's our real training.

830
01:18:36,683 --> 01:18:39,110
The names of people like  Raatan Sethi, and Dadabhai ..

831
01:18:39,310 --> 01:18:40,310
..who terrorize people of the city..

832
01:18:41,421 --> 01:18:43,252
... are not even mentioned in the police record.

833
01:18:43,690 --> 01:18:46,659
They do away with officers who register an FIR against them.

834
01:18:47,761 --> 01:18:50,252
Are these the people who'll fight?
Are these the people who'll run our country?

835
01:18:51,331 --> 01:18:53,299
They'll be given a license to torment people.,

836
01:18:53,700 --> 01:18:57,227
..and a few officers like us will be appointed for their security.

837
01:18:59,372 --> 01:19:02,671
But there can be a change. There can be improvement.

838
01:19:03,777 --> 01:19:06,678
People like Ratan Seti, Dadabhai and Bhosale should be shot ...

839
01:19:07,047 --> 01:19:11,677
... on the roads in front of the people. And I will do this pious job.

840
01:19:12,052 --> 01:19:14,987
Vijay! Think, before you speak!

841
01:19:16,723 --> 01:19:19,021
How long have you been in the?

842
01:19:20,460 --> 01:19:23,020
It's hardly been 9 months since you started the training.

843
01:19:23,730 --> 01:19:29,134
And you are so proud of yourself
that you'll change the face of law in your own way?

844
01:19:31,671 --> 01:19:32,638
Look ...

845
01:19:34,307 --> 01:19:36,275
... it's difficult to control one's self ...

846
01:19:37,244 --> 01:19:41,977
... in the phase you're passing through. I understand that.

847
01:19:42,816 --> 01:19:46,650
According to you the entire organization has changed its identity.

848
01:19:46,987 --> 01:19:48,113
That's possible.

849
01:19:49,356 --> 01:19:52,655
But what I regret, Vijay ...

850
01:19:53,426 --> 01:19:57,055
... is that you don't trust me either.

851
01:19:59,499 --> 01:20:01,990
I've been in this department for 22 years.

852
01:20:03,403 --> 01:20:06,895
I won't say that I've done some big tasks during this time.

853
01:20:08,475 --> 01:20:12,241
But I am  saved by his uniform stain of dishonesty.

854
01:20:13,713 --> 01:20:18,082
Perhaps that's why I haven't the situation of being embarrassed.

855
01:20:19,786 --> 01:20:24,849
But if you walk on the path of terrorism to gain justice..

856
01:20:26,426 --> 01:20:28,394
... I will be ashamed of myself.

857
01:20:32,899 --> 01:20:37,802
Vijay, I will find answers to your questions.

858
01:20:39,839 --> 01:20:41,704
Give me some time.

859
01:20:43,476 --> 01:20:45,444
I will not let the elections take place in this city.

860
01:20:47,414 --> 01:20:50,042
Those people who've got you in this situation...

861
01:20:50,817 --> 01:20:52,785
...will be in the custody of the law.

862
01:20:54,921 --> 01:20:57,890
And if you respect me even a little, ...

863
01:21:00,060 --> 01:21:04,326
...wait for my defeat on the path you've chosen..

864
01:21:06,967 --> 01:21:08,935
...  before you step on it.

865
01:21:14,774 --> 01:21:17,971
Sir, if you win, I will be very happy.

866
01:21:35,762 --> 01:21:38,094
What you're doing is not good, Bhosale.

867
01:21:39,899 --> 01:21:42,129
You're not only playing with Vijays life ...

868
01:21:43,503 --> 01:21:45,698
... but also with the prestige of the department.

869
01:21:46,172 --> 01:21:50,040
I like it. I like play such games.

870
01:21:51,211 --> 01:21:55,772
This young policeman didn't know I was fond of it.

871
01:21:57,017 --> 01:21:59,713
You had filled him with so much zeal while training him...

872
01:22:00,086 --> 01:22:02,281
... that he's unable to think what's good or bad for him.

873
01:22:03,757 --> 01:22:08,717
It's not too late yet: stop this game, Bhosale..

874
01:22:10,764 --> 01:22:12,732
I know Vijay is very dear to you.

875
01:22:13,566 --> 01:22:17,195
The fact that Vijay is under the control of  Pratap Bhosale..

876
01:22:17,771 --> 01:22:19,739
... might be worrying you much.

877
01:22:21,474 --> 01:22:25,001
This grip will still tighten more Pandey.

878
01:22:27,380 --> 01:22:29,348
It is good that you've met with Vijay.

879
01:22:30,717 --> 01:22:33,686
Because according to the new order of the court ...

880
01:22:34,421 --> 01:22:37,686
... no one can meet Vijay now.

881
01:22:55,965 --> 01:22:57,091
So, Vijay Singh.

882
01:22:58,968 --> 01:23:01,095
S. I. Trainee, batch number 26.

883
01:23:02,572 --> 01:23:04,563
Is resting in the lockup of crime branch?

884
01:23:08,711 --> 01:23:12,608
Duty, honesty, eh?

885
01:23:15,117 --> 01:23:17,347
Can you imagine that you will have such a fate?

886
01:23:18,087 --> 01:23:19,281
No, right?

887
01:23:20,056 --> 01:23:24,083
I still want to poison your body ...

888
01:23:24,493 --> 01:23:26,484
...with the drug registered in your charge-sheet.

889
01:23:55,758 --> 01:23:57,658
No, Mr. Pandey ... no.

890
01:23:58,694 --> 01:24:01,424
We hadn't got him in this field to become an ideal example.

891
01:24:02,665 --> 01:24:04,633
Vijay is our only child, Mr. Pandey.

892
01:24:06,035 --> 01:24:07,559
Our only child.

893
01:24:08,037 --> 01:24:11,097
Our happiness lies in his life in his happiness.

894
01:24:12,074 --> 01:24:17,011
Like most of the parents, we also dreamt that ....

895
01:24:17,380 --> 01:24:19,348
... he'd get a good job to live on and get married before we die.

896
01:24:19,682 --> 01:24:21,650
Then why did you make him a police?

897
01:24:22,718 --> 01:24:24,686
What do you take a police's job to be?

898
01:24:25,221 --> 01:24:27,689
The job of a police is not only a means of earning a living.

899
01:24:28,991 --> 01:24:32,620
A police officer gives his life to save other people's lives.

900
01:24:33,696 --> 01:24:35,664
That's what he vows when he enrolls.

901
01:24:37,166 --> 01:24:40,963
And I am glad that Vijay has understood..

902
01:24:41,163 --> 01:24:44,463
...the job of a police and his duties very well.

903
01:24:45,508 --> 01:24:47,533
He's the first young man,  ...

904
01:24:47,710 --> 01:24:49,910
...who's a complete soldier even with half training.

905
01:24:52,014 --> 01:24:55,279
A big change will take place because of your son.

906
01:24:56,686 --> 01:24:59,519
The anti-social people will see the real face of the law.

907
01:25:00,956 --> 01:25:04,221
The defamation law has got will also be erased.

908
01:25:04,660 --> 01:25:06,026
What does this mean, sir?

909
01:25:06,826 --> 01:25:09,226
Why do you want to transfer these officers?

910
01:25:10,099 --> 01:25:14,035
They know the city very well and can help us in the case of Sawant.

911
01:25:14,403 --> 01:25:18,339
Mr. Bhosale, are you advising me or defending these people?

912
01:25:18,708 --> 01:25:22,474
I make it clear that it will difficult for me
to do anything with the new officers.

913
01:25:22,978 --> 01:25:25,446
We are trying to find a way to ease your difficultes.

914
01:25:27,546 --> 01:25:30,646
Yes...yes, send Gupta upstairs!

915
01:25:31,187 --> 01:25:34,645
Give all the details of Sawant case to Mr. Pandey

916
01:25:35,191 --> 01:25:37,352
Mr.Pandey will investigate this case. - But, sir..

917
01:25:37,727 --> 01:25:39,695
I will handle the seniors.

918
01:25:40,663 --> 01:25:42,961
The truth of this case will surface now.

919
01:25:46,001 --> 01:25:48,231
So you will try to find the truth of this case now?

920
01:25:49,939 --> 01:25:54,171
Nothing will happen, Mr. Pandey. Your career will be ruined.

921
01:25:55,945 --> 01:25:57,037
Yes, Bhosale.

922
01:25:58,214 --> 01:26:01,206
Perhaps I'll have to bear such a loss.

923
01:26:02,051 --> 01:26:03,075
Perhaps.

924
01:26:05,654 --> 01:26:10,318
But, you will be punished like all brokers of law are.

925
01:26:11,961 --> 01:26:17,331
And the supporters you have on top of you ...

926
01:26:18,167 --> 01:26:21,933
... will refuse to shelter you then.

927
01:26:26,008 --> 01:26:30,945
And it will not happen perhaps.It will happen for sure.

928
01:27:04,213 --> 01:27:07,239
You are right. Mr Pandey will look into Sawant's case.

929
01:27:07,550 --> 01:27:10,485
It has nothing to do with Vijay's case. It's a totally different case.

930
01:27:10,986 --> 01:27:13,318
And Vijay's case is handled by the crime branch.

931
01:27:13,689 --> 01:27:15,418
What is Vijay's case?

932
01:27:16,659 --> 01:27:20,060
Vijay Singh's crime is very shameful for our department.

933
01:27:21,263 --> 01:27:25,927
If guardian of the law breaks the law
his crime is bigger than that of a normal criminal.

934
01:27:26,302 --> 01:27:29,294
What will happen to Vijay in this case?
- A police officer breaks discipline, take drugs.

935
01:27:29,672 --> 01:27:32,505
He takes a senior officer's gun..

936
01:27:32,975 --> 01:27:36,467
He kills one officer and injures another.

937
01:27:36,979 --> 01:27:40,346
What should be done with such a criminal?

938
01:27:50,726 --> 01:27:52,193
Sign, your rascal!

939
01:28:15,050 --> 01:28:19,810
Do anything!Just get Vijayreleased. He"s innocent, dad.

940
01:28:20,010 --> 01:28:22,710
He's being victimized.You know he's absolutely annocent.

941
01:28:22,810 --> 01:28:25,710
What's wrong with you? What the hell are you repeating?

942
01:28:25,728 --> 01:28:28,526
I am not sitting and watching: I am trying my best.

943
01:28:29,365 --> 01:28:31,560
But it is not easy getting Vijay out.

944
01:28:32,034 --> 01:28:36,494
And.. he himself is responsible to some
extent for the state he in.

945
01:28:38,694 --> 01:28:41,994
Daddy, Vijay is.. - Shut up! You just shut up and listen to me.

946
01:28:42,578 --> 01:28:47,413
What was his problem?
He went to Raatan Sethi's place and hit him.

947
01:28:47,983 --> 01:28:51,043
He created chaos at the police headquarter and also hit Bhosale.

948
01:28:51,243 --> 01:28:54,243
He's just an under training officer.

949
01:28:54,443 --> 01:28:57,443
Is that any bloody way to behave
with somebody who's much senior to you?

950
01:28:58,661 --> 01:29:01,562
I know Bhosale has made some false allegations against him.

951
01:29:02,097 --> 01:29:04,258
But lie? But how much can one line?

952
01:29:04,633 --> 01:29:07,227
He took inspector Gudbole's revolver and fired.

953
01:29:08,570 --> 01:29:12,529
It's possible that this is false, too.
But has he left any scope to prove that it's false?

954
01:29:13,943 --> 01:29:14,910
Sit down.

955
01:29:15,611 --> 01:29:21,447
You don't have any idea what hell I'm bearing to save him.

956
01:29:23,953 --> 01:29:28,447
I have to talk to the people I don't even like to meet.

957
01:29:29,947 --> 01:29:34,947
In my entire life, I've never been humiliated to this extenet

958
01:29:35,047 --> 01:29:38,347
Please, daddy! I'm sorry.

959
01:29:40,847 --> 01:29:42,447
I'm really very sorry.

960
01:29:44,173 --> 01:29:46,141
I hadn't thought of this at all.

961
01:29:47,276 --> 01:29:51,303
Perhaps I've no understanding of your duty and work.

962
01:29:53,649 --> 01:29:58,382
I had forgoten that
you're something else besides being my daddy.

963
01:30:00,956 --> 01:30:06,019
Daddy, please do not do anything
for Vijay that might harm your career.

964
01:30:07,519 --> 01:30:11,119
I'm very sorry daddy, I'm very sorry.

965
01:30:14,737 --> 01:30:17,399
Bhosle has made Vijay's case even more critical.

966
01:30:18,540 --> 01:30:22,442
And in this situation, if we take any step in favor of Vijay ...

967
01:30:22,945 --> 01:30:25,243
...that might benefit Bhosale more.

968
01:30:25,647 --> 01:30:29,606
Bhosle is able to do all this so easily because..

969
01:30:30,119 --> 01:30:33,577
he's crushing the law, while we are following the law.

970
01:30:33,856 --> 01:30:37,923
Why?Why are following the law? What do we gain by following it?

971
01:30:39,661 --> 01:30:43,324
Those persons, with whose orders and signatures this law runs ...

972
01:30:43,699 --> 01:30:46,566
... has people like Bhosale to attend their parties.

973
01:30:47,069 --> 01:30:49,560
While people like us have to attend their meetings to get humiliated.

974
01:30:51,760 --> 01:30:57,360
Mr. Pandey, I've restrained myself all these years, in the name of the duty.

975
01:30:57,446 --> 01:31:00,877
I've only a slave.

976
01:31:02,418 --> 01:31:06,218
The feeling of duty I supressed for years ...

977
01:31:07,923 --> 01:31:13,088
... today I saw much respect for that duty in my daughter's eyes.

978
01:31:15,931 --> 01:31:19,492
Mr. Pandey things will change much more after the elections.

979
01:31:22,104 --> 01:31:26,541
And then it'll be more more difficult for us to save Vijay.

980
01:31:28,077 --> 01:31:30,375
There is a solution for every problem, Mr. Choudhari.

981
01:31:32,214 --> 01:31:34,114
One thing is certain.

982
01:31:34,750 --> 01:31:40,382
Whenever goodness and wickedness come face to face,
it's the wickedness that alwyas loses.

983
01:32:12,521 --> 01:32:16,184
Desa, look, I'm taking the loan on interest.

984
01:32:16,558 --> 01:32:20,892
Dadabhai, the business very low these days. The market is down.

985
01:32:21,230 --> 01:32:26,293
Don't you eat every day? Your kids don't beg on roads. Pig!

986
01:32:26,332 --> 01:32:28,967
This poverty is only to show me, right?

987
01:32:29,006 --> 01:32:33,072
Where did you get the 2 lakh rupees you gave to Sethi?

988
01:32:33,942 --> 01:32:38,072
Rascal! You've changed loyalites with the changing face of elections.

989
01:32:38,447 --> 01:32:42,042
Dadabhai, please try to understand my problem.
If you say,I can give 50 thousand ...

990
01:32:42,417 --> 01:32:43,384
Shut up!

991
01:32:57,966 --> 01:33:00,526
Please don't believe these headlines of the papers.

992
01:33:01,570 --> 01:33:03,538
I haven't made any such statement.

993
01:33:04,139 --> 01:33:06,107
This is all a political game.

994
01:33:07,176 --> 01:33:10,577
Someone is trying to take advantage
by printing a false statement of mine.

995
01:33:11,113 --> 01:33:13,547
What is truth and what is a lie we do not know, sir.

996
01:33:14,683 --> 01:33:16,947
Thegangsterrs are working openly in the city

997
01:33:17,319 --> 01:33:19,287
... and our department is doing nothing to stop them.

998
01:33:20,622 --> 01:33:25,059
We have seen it all. They didn't take this much time to trap Vijay.

999
01:33:26,795 --> 01:33:30,026
Sir, its very easy to trap an innocent man in this system.

1000
01:33:30,399 --> 01:33:32,367
But it is very difficult to get him released.

1001
01:33:34,736 --> 01:33:37,967
What then should be done? You guys tell me.

1002
01:33:38,707 --> 01:33:41,301
What should we do and how? Please, tell me.

1003
01:33:44,713 --> 01:33:46,977
With your advice ...

1004
01:33:47,683 --> 01:33:52,382
... I might do some really great task before I retire.

1005
01:33:54,656 --> 01:33:55,623
Tell me.

1006
01:33:56,758 --> 01:33:57,725
Speak up, Ravi.

1007
01:34:00,629 --> 01:34:01,596
Speak up, Rana.

1008
01:34:03,966 --> 01:34:04,933
Kamat!

1009
01:34:07,069 --> 01:34:08,934
You also speak!

1010
01:34:09,705 --> 01:34:14,233
What should  the commissioner and I do in this situatipn?

1011
01:34:15,677 --> 01:34:17,645
What do you think guys?

1012
01:34:18,480 --> 01:34:22,610
Innocent Vijay is a labeled a criminal and is jailed.

1013
01:34:23,185 --> 01:34:25,153
Is this something I feel proud of?

1014
01:34:27,589 --> 01:34:32,549
A soldier, whom I taught the meaning of duty and showed a path..

1015
01:34:33,729 --> 01:34:36,596
..is trapped in a mess walking on that path..

1016
01:34:37,065 --> 01:34:40,501
... and his life and career, everything is at stake.

1017
01:34:42,137 --> 01:34:45,300
You all feel very sorry for what has happened with Vijay.

1018
01:34:46,608 --> 01:34:49,236
But it is my hard work that is injured directly.

1019
01:34:50,646 --> 01:34:53,581
If I fail to get  Vijay out of this mess...

1020
01:34:54,650 --> 01:34:59,349
... it will be very shameful for me to live with that guilt.

1021
01:35:44,366 --> 01:35:46,129
Run away from here! Run!

1022
01:36:40,489 --> 01:36:44,015
Take it! Take it!

1023
01:36:47,729 --> 01:36:48,889
Over there.

1024
01:36:53,735 --> 01:36:55,730
What are you waiting for? Shoot!

1025
01:37:53,662 --> 01:37:56,595
Hey! Stop! Stop!

1026
01:38:01,036 --> 01:38:02,401
Who do you work for?

1027
01:38:04,639 --> 01:38:08,234
Tell me, who do you work for? - Dadabhai.

1028
01:38:10,612 --> 01:38:12,812
Pandey, sir ...- Shut up, pig!

1029
01:38:13,949 --> 01:38:15,211
Dadabhai!

1030
01:38:16,685 --> 01:38:20,952
Bhai (Big boss)?! Rascal!

1031
01:38:22,624 --> 01:38:27,254
You want power? You want power for people's welfare, eh?

1032
01:38:29,664 --> 01:38:33,726
Leader? Wow!

1033
01:38:33,767 --> 01:38:37,329
People like you have made this word sound like a joke.

1034
01:38:40,675 --> 01:38:42,540
Take it off! C'mon, take it off. - No..- Take it off!

1035
01:38:46,982 --> 01:38:51,782
You know what this is? Do you know what it is?

1036
01:38:52,587 --> 01:38:54,555
It is the pride of our nation.

1037
01:38:55,056 --> 01:38:58,287
This tri-colored band is symbol of our prestige and dignity!

1038
01:38:58,927 --> 01:39:02,488
Lakhs of people became martyrs to maintain its honor.

1039
01:39:03,164 --> 01:39:05,462
People bow down to it with respect.

1040
01:39:05,934 --> 01:39:09,028
And people like you have made it a scarf?!

1041
01:39:10,672 --> 01:39:12,902
Constable, take off his clothes.

1042
01:39:13,508 --> 01:39:17,203
What are you doing? This is not right, Pandey!
- Is not right? Take off his shirt!

1043
01:39:17,303 --> 01:39:24,403
This..this is not right..Pandey..this is not right..I tellyou..

1044
01:39:24,953 --> 01:39:27,183
I say..Don't do this to me. - Hold his legs. - Pandey!

1045
01:39:28,957 --> 01:39:34,925
Take off his pyjama. - Let go of me! Let go!

1046
01:39:34,963 --> 01:39:41,732
What are you doing? This is not right, Pandey! Pandey!

1047
01:39:43,705 --> 01:39:47,532
Pandey! Don't humiliate me in front of every one! Isay! I say!

1048
01:39:47,976 --> 01:39:50,069
Hurry up! Take off his underwear now.

1049
01:39:54,269 --> 01:39:57,069
Pandey!

1050
01:40:01,221 --> 01:40:03,355
Let me go!

1051
01:40:07,963 --> 01:40:13,697
Pandey, shoot me! Shoot me! Say that it was an encounter.

1052
01:40:13,702 --> 01:40:16,170
Give me the underwear.- Don't humiliate me so much.

1053
01:40:18,107 --> 01:40:20,575
Pandey. - Let him put on the underwear without the rope.

1054
01:40:20,942 --> 01:40:24,036
Shoot me, Pandey! Shoot me!

1055
01:40:24,546 --> 01:40:26,639
He might commit suicide with this rope.

1056
01:40:29,050 --> 01:40:33,214
People like him should not die in our lockups.

1057
01:40:45,233 --> 01:40:48,862
The arrangements for the Loksabha elections
to be held on 5th August are on.

1058
01:40:49,237 --> 01:40:51,205
The security is made rigid in the city.

1059
01:40:51,606 --> 01:40:55,201
The police have jailed forty antisocial people.

1060
01:40:55,577 --> 01:41:00,537
Around 400 companies of security are appointed
to deal with any sort of unpleasant incident.

1061
01:41:01,116 --> 01:41:05,553
It's of no use. You won't benefit.
I told you I haven't given money to anyone.

1062
01:41:06,087 --> 01:41:09,454
You did given to Raatan Sethi 200 000 rupees..

1063
01:41:10,225 --> 01:41:13,558
We also  have evidence to that.- I say it was all a lie.

1064
01:41:14,095 --> 01:41:16,120
Dada has given my name to frame me.

1065
01:41:16,498 --> 01:41:19,026
He had asked for a big amount from me for the election expense,..

1066
01:41:19,101 --> 01:41:22,470
.. but I had denied flatly. I'm not giving money to anyone.

1067
01:41:22,937 --> 01:41:25,064
This is the truth. I will keep saying that.

1068
01:41:28,076 --> 01:41:34,572
Look, you know some people won't find it right
that you were detained for an inquiry.

1069
01:41:36,117 --> 01:41:39,086
I am saying this for your benefit...- Sir this - What is it?

1070
01:41:41,690 --> 01:41:45,456
All right. Tell Shinde to take comissioner's signature
and come back to me. - Ok, sir.

1071
01:41:46,561 --> 01:41:50,520
When will you say the truth?
When our procedure will be gone too far?

1072
01:41:51,399 --> 01:41:55,961
And till you speak the truth, Desai, I won't release you.

1073
01:42:07,582 --> 01:42:10,449
You've written the statement. So, what were you saying?

1074
01:42:10,919 --> 01:42:14,548
You were talking of some Thakkar ...- Yes, Harry Thakkar

1075
01:42:15,023 --> 01:42:17,014
He owns a clothes shop at Dadar.

1076
01:42:17,659 --> 01:42:21,891
Ok, the people you say have given
200 000 rupees to Raatan Sethi are..

1077
01:42:22,630 --> 01:42:27,431
...  Khanna, Thakkar, Damani, Manjit Singh ...

1078
01:42:27,936 --> 01:42:31,565
No it's Manjit Singh is Paramajit Singh.
He owns a auto parts shop in Mahim.

1079
01:42:32,107 --> 01:42:34,234
It also owns a petrol pump in Chembur.

1080
01:42:34,642 --> 01:42:37,304
And the 200,000 rupees, you gave..

1081
01:42:37,679 --> 01:42:42,415
They were notes  of 100 rupees.
I gave them in a briefcase: it was grey perhaps.

1082
01:42:42,951 --> 01:42:48,014
I gavethat bag to Raatan's man myself
nearby the Hanuman temple outside the station.

1083
01:42:48,690 --> 01:42:51,056
All right. Give him some tea.

1084
01:42:53,661 --> 01:42:57,119
Do not worry, Mr. Desailly. You will not be any problems.

1085
01:42:59,100 --> 01:43:01,125
I want details about these four people. - Yes sir.

1086
01:43:01,325 --> 01:43:03,325
Only then can we arrest Raatan Sethi.

1087
01:43:04,205 --> 01:43:06,398
Appoint Tande  and Sharma on his task.

1088
01:43:06,674 --> 01:43:09,974
Tell them I want their reports before eleven. - Ok, sir.

1089
01:43:10,378 --> 01:43:14,439
Final stage of voting was conducted peacefully today in the state.

1090
01:43:14,983 --> 01:43:18,578
But the voters showed less enthusiasm than last year.

1091
01:43:19,087 --> 01:43:22,147
A total 7% votes were found in the 34 voting centers.

1092
01:43:22,347 --> 01:43:27,447
Ok, sir.Yes, sir. Ok, sir. Come on.

1093
01:43:38,673 --> 01:43:42,507
The counting of votes for the 26 Loksabha
seats of the state is started.

1094
01:43:43,011 --> 01:43:45,936
According to information now the candidate of Jan Sheva Mandal ...

1095
01:43:46,014 --> 01:43:48,312
... Mr. Raatan Sethi is leading by  25,000 votes at present.

1096
01:43:55,557 --> 01:44:00,324
Bhosle, I want to make a little party at my bungalow.

1097
01:44:01,229 --> 01:44:05,461
And that young zealous, brave boy,Vijay Singh ...

1098
01:44:05,967 --> 01:44:09,425
... I want to welcome him at my bungalow..

1099
01:44:10,705 --> 01:44:13,533
Bring that boy at my bungalow, Bhosale.

1100
01:44:45,707 --> 01:44:47,675
"You have kohl in your eyes."

1101
01:44:48,343 --> 01:44:50,311
"The flowers in your hair are pretty."

1102
01:44:50,678 --> 01:44:55,109
"Your anklets, earing and bangles.."

1103
01:44:55,950 --> 01:45:00,708
"What did they do?"

1104
01:45:01,356 --> 01:45:07,149
"Last night my darling held my hand. Oh dear!- Oh dear!"

1105
01:45:08,963 --> 01:45:14,455
"Then he slowly pressed my finger. Oh dear!- Oh dear!"

1106
01:45:21,976 --> 01:45:26,468
"Last night my darling held my hand. Oh dear!- Oh dear!"

1107
01:45:26,981 --> 01:45:32,039
"Then he slowly pressed my finger. Oh dear!- Oh dear!"

1108
01:45:32,153 --> 01:45:37,314
"I was bid farewell first. Then I came home as a bride."

1109
01:45:37,392 --> 01:45:40,051
"I take oath of it."

1110
01:45:40,161 --> 01:45:42,558
"Oh dear!- Oh dear!"

1111
01:45:45,058 --> 01:45:50,058
"Last night my darling held my hand. Oh dear!- Oh dear!"

1112
01:45:50,258 --> 01:45:55,258
"Then he slowly pressed my finger. Oh dear!"

1113
01:46:15,958 --> 01:46:22,458
It was cold. To top that, he was very ruthless."

1114
01:46:23,658 --> 01:46:30,158
He behaved the way he liked all night.

1115
01:46:30,979 --> 01:46:35,575
It was cold. To top that, he was very ruthless."

1116
01:46:36,284 --> 01:46:40,948
He behaved the way he liked all night.

1117
01:46:41,748 --> 01:46:48,548
He behaved the way he liked all night.

1118
01:46:48,663 --> 01:46:54,463
"My wrist is still aching. Oh dear!- Oh dear!"

1119
01:46:56,471 --> 01:47:01,537
"Last night my darling held my hand. Oh dear!- Oh dear!"

1120
01:47:01,609 --> 01:47:07,209
"Then he slowly pressed my finger. Oh dear!"

1121
01:47:27,409 --> 01:47:34,109
" Little by little, he aroused love in me."

1122
01:47:35,309 --> 01:47:41,509
" I coludn't brace myself and slept in his arms."

1123
01:47:42,617 --> 01:47:47,384
" Little by little, he aroused love in me."

1124
01:47:47,989 --> 01:47:52,551
" I coludn't brace myself and slept in his arms."

1125
01:47:53,251 --> 01:47:59,051
" I coludn't brace myself and slept in his arms."

1126
01:48:00,435 --> 01:48:05,701
"The blanket melted with heat. Oh dear!- Oh dear!"

1127
01:48:07,942 --> 01:48:13,271
"Last night my darling held my hand. Oh dear!- Oh dear!"

1128
01:48:13,347 --> 01:48:18,510
"Then he slowly pressed my finger. Oh dear!- Oh dear!"

1129
01:48:18,619 --> 01:48:23,744
"I was bid farewell first. Then I came home as a bride."

1130
01:48:23,824 --> 01:48:28,717
"I take oath of it. Oh dear!- Oh dear!""

1131
01:48:31,017 --> 01:48:36,317
"Last night my darling held my hand. Oh dear!- Oh dear!"

1132
01:48:36,517 --> 01:48:42,017
"Then he slowly pressed my finger. Oh dear!"

1133
01:48:52,420 --> 01:48:56,015
No,no! This is too much.

1134
01:48:56,691 --> 01:48:59,716
Help him get up. Get him up.

1135
01:49:17,044 --> 01:49:18,909
How do you feel?

1136
01:49:20,948 --> 01:49:29,016
All this that's happening, how do find it? - You rascal!

1137
01:49:32,960 --> 01:49:37,397
Mr. Sethi, I had met a strong willed officer like him in Hyaderbad.

1138
01:49:38,099 --> 01:49:39,930
He didn't listen to anything or understand anything.

1139
01:49:40,568 --> 01:49:43,298
After investigating his records, we found he was a rascal.

1140
01:49:43,671 --> 01:49:45,639
He has two fathers.

1141
01:49:47,141 --> 01:49:49,941
Double strong. Is that the case with you, too?

1142
01:49:50,077 --> 01:49:51,044
You Dog!

1143
01:49:58,286 --> 01:49:59,746
Let go of me!

1144
01:50:15,846 --> 01:50:16,946
Grab him.

1145
01:50:39,660 --> 01:50:42,328
This name was going to change my destiny, wasn't it?

1146
01:50:43,965 --> 01:50:45,933
You must have heard my name.

1147
01:50:46,968 --> 01:50:48,868
Raatan Sethi.

1148
01:50:52,268 --> 01:51:01,468
R.A.A.T.A.N! You see, I write double A's.

1149
01:51:02,016 --> 01:51:02,883
Rana!

1150
01:51:14,629 --> 01:51:18,597
You're an honestofficer of the law, right?

1151
01:51:18,933 --> 01:51:26,596
I regret that your death
will be registered as a suicide in the book of law.

1152
01:51:28,542 --> 01:51:29,509
Got that?

1153
01:51:30,144 --> 01:51:33,011
No? Gupta!

1154
01:51:46,160 --> 01:51:51,063
It takes twenty minutes to reach the nearest hospital from here.

1155
01:51:52,900 --> 01:51:56,461
If you reach the hospital, perhaps you'll be saved.

1156
01:51:58,572 --> 01:52:04,875
But my men will take you directly
to the lockup of crime branch from here.

1157
01:52:07,615 --> 01:52:11,476
Get up, guys. Very good!

1158
01:52:32,239 --> 01:52:34,230
You'll win the election, Sethi.

1159
01:52:35,076 --> 01:52:37,340
But you won't be able to hear the news of your victory.

1160
01:52:39,146 --> 01:52:43,378
Because you'll be dead before tha news is out.

1161
01:53:16,375 --> 01:53:17,899
Follow them!

1162
01:54:07,761 --> 01:54:09,761
What is all this, man?

1163
01:54:09,861 --> 01:54:15,329
It's so damn embrassing! How could it happen?

1164
01:54:15,634 --> 01:54:18,262
Did they have stronger weapons than we did?

1165
01:54:23,642 --> 01:54:26,133
Siddiqui, Mhatre and Gupta..

1166
01:54:26,645 --> 01:54:31,809
...they kept asking me to assign them work.
Now they're done for!

1167
01:54:35,788 --> 01:54:37,948
Hello. - Hello. Get Mr. Pandey on line, please. - Yes.

1168
01:54:38,248 --> 01:54:39,848
Sir, there's a call for you.

1169
01:54:43,962 --> 01:54:46,330
Hello. - Sir, Vijay has cut vein on his wrist.

1170
01:54:47,165 --> 01:54:50,265
What? - Yes, sir. He is at Oberoi Hospital.

1171
01:54:56,208 --> 01:54:58,699
Child! I know everything.

1172
01:54:59,311 --> 01:55:01,142
I've found out all details.

1173
01:55:01,613 --> 01:55:06,312
They've deceived me. Your father.. and Roma.

1174
01:55:08,153 --> 01:55:10,178
They kept many secrets from me.

1175
01:55:11,189 --> 01:55:12,247
Just look at him!

1176
01:55:12,858 --> 01:55:15,292
Is this our son we sent to look for a job?

1177
01:55:16,795 --> 01:55:19,956
My son was handsome.

1178
01:55:21,366 --> 01:55:23,994
What have they done to my child!

1179
01:55:24,436 --> 01:55:25,801
Look, Revti..

1180
01:55:26,638 --> 01:55:31,807
No! I do not want any consolations now.

1181
01:55:34,345 --> 01:55:35,676
I'm strong enough.

1182
01:55:36,180 --> 01:55:40,241
Get it clear, Vijay's father.

1183
01:55:41,653 --> 01:55:44,679
Nothing will happen to my son. He would not die.

1184
01:55:45,223 --> 01:55:48,954
My son will not die. He has so much work to do yet.

1185
01:55:49,561 --> 01:55:53,320
The people who've got him ... in this state are in this very city, right?

1186
01:55:53,432 --> 01:55:57,497
Revti! - He is yet to douse the revenge in my heart.

1187
01:55:58,002 --> 01:55:59,970
How can he die just like that?

1188
01:56:00,305 --> 01:56:02,637
What is this? What is this going on?

1189
01:56:03,174 --> 01:56:07,334
My son does not need your medicines. Get out of here!

1190
01:56:07,446 --> 01:56:10,239
Revti! What are you doing? - Let go of me.

1191
01:56:10,582 --> 01:56:13,642
Auntie! - Are you out of your mind? - Stay away!

1192
01:56:14,786 --> 01:56:17,380
What's wrong with you? What are you doing?
Are you're in your senses?

1193
01:56:17,755 --> 01:56:20,053
Yes I am in my senses.

1194
01:56:20,425 --> 01:56:22,518
My son does not want the blood of this city.

1195
01:56:23,031 --> 01:56:28,658
Doctor! Please! Mother is right.

1196
01:56:30,068 --> 01:56:31,501
I will not die.

1197
01:56:36,608 --> 01:56:38,406
Sir, he was complaining of headache and couldn't see clearly.

1198
01:56:38,706 --> 01:56:40,506
So we decided to have a C.T. scan of the brain.

1199
01:56:40,712 --> 01:56:42,407
We'll get the report within 12 an hour, - Thank you doctor.

1200
01:56:43,616 --> 01:56:47,546
Sir! Sir, Vijay's mother has refused to give him any blood.

1201
01:56:48,052 --> 01:56:51,510
So he's in a worse state.- But why did she do that?

1202
01:56:52,156 --> 01:56:54,147
She was very angry and ...

1203
01:56:54,694 --> 01:56:58,622
I see. But why did Vijay allow her to do so?

1204
01:56:59,230 --> 01:57:03,360
He should understand. - Sir, Vijay took off
the needle from his wrist himself.

1205
01:57:03,768 --> 01:57:07,369
You mean Vijay also refused to take a blood transfusion? - Yes, sir.

1206
01:57:09,007 --> 01:57:11,100
How did he agree for the C.T. scan then?

1207
01:57:27,125 --> 01:57:30,094
Doctor, where's Vijay?- Sir..sir.. the window ...

1208
01:57:36,034 --> 01:57:38,002
He's gone down with the help of the pipe.

1209
01:57:39,037 --> 01:57:41,369
He played this drama to run away from here.

1210
01:57:41,739 --> 01:57:43,707
Who is refusing you to fight the battle?

1211
01:57:44,175 --> 01:57:47,406
But if you want to win it, you must be take every step carefully.

1212
01:57:47,779 --> 01:57:50,475
Vijay, we won't be facing Sethi or his goons.

1213
01:57:50,982 --> 01:57:53,951
But the men of our own department are waiting on  ...

1214
01:57:54,318 --> 01:57:57,549
... every corner to kill us.- They'll be killed. They all vill be.

1215
01:57:58,156 --> 01:58:00,954
They truthful and innocent people have shed much blood.

1216
01:58:02,694 --> 01:58:04,662
I do not want to escape. I want to fight them all.

1217
01:58:05,163 --> 01:58:07,131
How will we face them?

1218
01:58:07,732 --> 01:58:09,962
Should we stand before their weapons and kill ourselves?

1219
01:58:10,401 --> 01:58:12,631
We don't want to get killed. we want to kill them.

1220
01:58:14,072 --> 01:58:17,371
Vijay, we cannot use zeal and passion
as our weapons to fight them.

1221
01:58:18,009 --> 01:58:21,445
What do we have to resist their weapons? What do we have?

1222
01:58:29,020 --> 01:58:32,979
If our hands are like iron, they can turn to weapons, too.

1223
02:00:32,176 --> 02:00:34,371
Bhosle! Here I am.

1224
02:01:03,708 --> 02:01:06,176
I could have shot you directly.

1225
02:01:06,978 --> 02:01:11,472
But I wanted to see the fear in your eyes before dying.

1226
02:01:29,700 --> 02:01:31,497
You see death Bhosale?

1227
02:01:38,009 --> 02:01:42,275
Bhosale, did youever think this would happen to you?

1228
02:01:43,748 --> 02:01:45,272
No, right?

1229
02:01:46,717 --> 02:01:49,515
I've started doing good to people like you.

1230
02:01:55,795 --> 02:01:58,395
Hello. Tell me.

1231
02:01:59,964 --> 02:02:01,329
Ok,I'll be there in a while.

1232
02:02:02,700 --> 02:02:04,429
Vijay has killed Bhosale.

1233
02:02:05,603 --> 02:02:09,095
Hey, tell Pakiya to take car.
I'll be going to Mr. Sethi's bundalow.

1234
02:02:11,976 --> 02:02:13,443
Of course he'd be killed.

1235
02:02:15,046 --> 02:02:17,014
Bhosle was going to be killed.

1236
02:02:18,649 --> 02:02:22,278
People who work and decide with passion ...

1237
02:02:22,687 --> 02:02:25,588
... rather than their brains meet this sort of end.

1238
02:03:15,039 --> 02:03:17,007
The leader of Jan Seva Mandal, Ratan Sethi ...

1239
02:03:17,375 --> 02:03:19,002
... is ahead of all political parties and ...

1240
02:03:19,377 --> 02:03:22,210
... independent candidates of the state.

1241
02:03:22,580 --> 02:03:26,277
He is leading by 75,000 votes compared to Dadabhai.

1242
02:04:01,721 --> 02:04:07,957
Hello. - Vijay, sir Pandeyhas gone
to Sethi's place with some officers to arrest him.

1243
02:04:14,732 --> 02:04:17,565
Where is Raatan Seti? Where is he hiding?

1244
02:04:18,035 --> 02:04:19,127
He ...

1245
02:04:22,740 --> 02:04:25,707
Speak up! - Hello.

1246
02:04:25,776 --> 02:04:29,504
Speak! - He went to his house in Panvel. - Hello!

1247
02:04:30,582 --> 02:04:34,345
Hello! - Where is his house in Panvel? The one on the highway?

1248
02:04:34,785 --> 02:04:37,345
It's beyond the fields, on the left side. - Hello. Hello.

1249
02:04:43,060 --> 02:04:47,497
It was Vijay on the line.
He's found out about the house with your stupidity.

1250
02:04:47,797 --> 02:04:49,597
Sorry, sir. - Use your brain.

1251
02:04:50,234 --> 02:04:51,594
Dhananjay! - Yes, sir? - Tell all the checkpoints posts on  the Bombay.

1252
02:04:51,794 --> 02:04:55,794
Tell all the checkpoints posts on  the Bombay. - Pune Highway to stop that.

1253
02:05:01,011 --> 02:05:07,274
Mr. Raatan Seti of Jan Seva Mandal is ahead
with 125,000 votes in the 2nd phase of the election.

1254
02:05:36,046 --> 02:05:41,006
The boyshave left Bombay. One has to pass that check-post to reach this place.

1255
02:05:41,752 --> 02:05:45,711
Be ready with everything. None of them should remain alive.

1256
02:05:57,001 --> 02:05:58,025
Kutti ...

1257
02:05:59,336 --> 02:06:04,968
... just 6 to 8 guys are roaming openly with weapons in the city.

1258
02:06:08,045 --> 02:06:11,537
And then they also leave the city.

1259
02:06:15,019 --> 02:06:16,043
Too much!

1260
02:06:20,224 --> 02:06:21,987
And our police?!

1261
02:06:23,687 --> 02:06:26,287
Fine. Ok. sir. Yes, sir.

1262
02:06:33,704 --> 02:06:36,138
Every thig is prepared for our welcome ahead.

1263
02:06:36,740 --> 02:06:39,504
We should leave the highway.- Come on.

1264
02:07:02,733 --> 02:07:05,497
You guys go throught Khedgaon, we will go by the road.

1265
02:07:27,397 --> 02:07:28,897
Bloody Jokers!

1266
02:07:41,038 --> 02:07:43,529
There's no need to worry, Mr. Sethi.

1267
02:07:44,041 --> 02:07:48,239
As soon as those guys reach the check-post, they'll be done for.

1268
02:07:50,114 --> 02:07:52,275
I've appointed "Tiger Force" over there.

1269
02:07:52,650 --> 02:07:56,518
"Tiger Force"! They just shoot in the head.

1270
02:09:13,497 --> 02:09:15,522
Move, or I'll ...- What will you do? You'll  shoot?

1271
02:09:15,999 --> 02:09:18,297
Will you hoot me?C'mon, shoot! Go.

1272
02:09:18,669 --> 02:09:19,966
Sir..sir, let me go...

1273
02:09:27,766 --> 02:09:29,066
C'mon, boys. Get in fast!

1274
02:09:53,866 --> 02:09:55,666
Bloody Jokers!

1275
02:10:00,644 --> 02:10:03,942
What are you doing? -  Let go! - Leave that thing.

1276
02:10:04,381 --> 02:10:05,939
Who are these people?

1277
02:10:07,718 --> 02:10:10,516
Put my hand! - Please leave that!

1278
02:10:10,988 --> 02:10:11,955
Go inside!

1279
02:10:15,659 --> 02:10:19,618
You are under the oath of our child.... Where is our son?

1280
02:10:20,164 --> 02:10:23,054
My child! - My child!

1281
02:11:58,662 --> 02:12:01,927
This is the hand of the tortured young man, Seti.

1282
02:12:03,467 --> 02:12:07,927
Whoever it slapps is ruined.

1283
02:12:09,273 --> 02:12:11,241
Forget to target the objective ...

1284
02:12:12,643 --> 02:12:16,238
... Your eyes will take a long time to focus in something.

1285
02:12:50,747 --> 02:12:52,374
I told you, Sethi.

1286
02:12:52,716 --> 02:12:55,985
I'll kill you before you can hear the news of your victory.

1287
02:13:00,023 --> 02:13:03,220
Nilesh, it is time for the news bulletin.

1288
02:13:20,744 --> 02:13:24,236
Mr. Raatan Sethi has won the election with 225,000 votes.

1289
02:13:24,615 --> 02:13:27,584
He has defeated Dadabhai of  Lokkalyan Manch.

1290
02:13:28,051 --> 02:13:31,578
Raatan Seti won election three times in succession in the region of Golvadi.

1291
02:13:32,055 --> 02:13:35,286
The last round of counting the votes is over now.

1292
02:13:55,612 --> 02:13:57,307
You've won, Vijay.

1293
02:14:00,017 --> 02:14:03,214
You've done what you said.

1294
02:14:08,492 --> 02:14:13,987
But what is it? I can not see the joy of the victory of your face.

1295
02:14:17,167 --> 02:14:18,498
Look at me!

1296
02:14:20,137 --> 02:14:22,298
How embarrassed I am for my defeat.

1297
02:14:26,543 --> 02:14:30,001
No, sir, I haven't won.

1298
02:14:32,716 --> 02:14:37,346
I'd consider myself succesful if I had done this job ...

1299
02:14:37,721 --> 02:14:42,749
... within the boundary of law as a soldier. 

1300
02:14:45,062 --> 02:14:47,030
I'm not happy, sir.

1301
02:14:48,098 --> 02:14:57,967
Because what I've done hasembarrassed you. I'm sorry.

1302
02:14:59,743 --> 02:15:01,301
Take the strecher upwards.

1303
02:15:04,214 --> 02:15:07,703
Carefully. Yes, enough.

1304
02:15:32,843 --> 02:15:33,810
Wait, son.

1305
02:15:36,780 --> 02:15:41,410
I want to understand whatever has happened to you
 till now and whatever.. 

1306
02:15:42,052 --> 02:15:44,020
... will happen ahead.

1307
02:15:46,123 --> 02:15:47,090
Dad ...

1308
02:15:49,659 --> 02:15:53,652
Mr. Pandey want to know wether this van..

1309
02:15:54,164 --> 02:15:56,257
... is taking the soldier sor the criminals.

1310
02:16:02,139 --> 02:16:05,165
The identity these young men have is different, Mr. Singh.

1311
02:16:06,176 --> 02:16:09,976
The battle of 22 days they faced and its consequences...

1312
02:16:10,747 --> 02:16:14,314
... have brought a very unique face of our system to the forefront.

1313
02:16:15,118 --> 02:16:17,985
Corruption, a disease.

1314
02:16:18,355 --> 02:16:20,653
I could feel it only at the top.

1315
02:16:21,158 --> 02:16:23,149
But actually it's reached down to the roots.

1316
02:16:24,127 --> 02:16:27,995
And these young men have done the good deed.

1317
02:16:32,736 --> 02:16:37,537
Their rebellion is the right answer to our rotten system.

1318
02:16:43,780 --> 02:16:46,010
This is the beginning of a revolution.

1319
02:16:54,010 --> 02:16:55,210
Cadets!

1320
02:16:57,410 --> 02:16:58,410
Move in!

1321
02:17:01,910 --> 02:17:03,610
Fast!

1322
02:17:05,910 --> 02:17:07,810
Sir!

1323
02:17:22,910 --> 02:17:24,710
Bloody Jokers!
