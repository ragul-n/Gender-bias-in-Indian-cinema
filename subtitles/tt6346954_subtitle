1
00:01:18,398 --> 00:01:20,398
'DDR'

2
00:01:20,399 --> 00:01:21,399
Is he mic'ed up?

3
00:01:30,399 --> 00:01:36,399
That dawn will come some day...

4
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:47,399
You have my article with
my blackened face, too?

5
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,399
I have all your articles.

6
00:01:51,399 --> 00:01:53,399
Azaad sir, this is such an honour
for me.

7
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:55,399
Thank you.

8
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,817
I still don't see why you're
making a documentary on me.

9
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:00,399
Who'll watch?

10
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:01,399
Many, sir.

11
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:03,399
Ready?

12
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:05,759
Sir, could we just check your mic?

13
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:07,399
Please say something.

14
00:02:13,399 --> 00:02:15,398
The stains of blood
on the floor.

15
00:02:15,399 --> 00:02:17,399
The smell of corpses in
that lane.

16
00:02:18,399 --> 00:02:21,399
Over these existing borders
a few more are drawn.

17
00:02:22,399 --> 00:02:25,399
Sir, can you tell us about
yourself? To the camera.

18
00:02:30,399 --> 00:02:31,817
My name is Vinod Durge.

19
00:02:32,399 --> 00:02:37,399
I've been living in Mumbai
for many years.

20
00:02:38,399 --> 00:02:42,399
23, 24. Yes, 24 years.

21
00:02:44,399 --> 00:02:46,399
And...

22
00:02:48,817 --> 00:02:53,398
During the day I work
at a Tar company...

23
00:02:53,399 --> 00:02:55,399
as a manager.

24
00:02:56,399 --> 00:02:58,399
And...

25
00:03:01,399 --> 00:03:03,399
At night, I'm free. Azaad.

26
00:03:07,399 --> 00:03:12,399
My columns are printed every Sunday
in a paper called News Express.

27
00:03:16,399 --> 00:03:20,399
Everyone knows me as 'Azaad.'

28
00:03:24,399 --> 00:03:29,399
"Azaad."

29
00:03:34,399 --> 00:03:37,398
Yes, Ma. I've reached.

30
00:03:37,399 --> 00:03:39,398
I came straight from the airport.

31
00:03:39,399 --> 00:03:41,399
- Are you coming?
- Just leaving.

32
00:03:42,399 --> 00:03:44,399
Did you check Papa's footage?

33
00:03:45,399 --> 00:03:46,399
Any clues?

34
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,399
Ma, I seriously doubt this footage
will tell us much.

35
00:03:51,399 --> 00:03:52,399
I think we're wasting our time.

36
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,817
Sameer...

37
00:03:55,399 --> 00:03:57,398
Check carefully.
His phone's been off for two days.

38
00:03:57,399 --> 00:03:58,519
I've asked everybody, but...

39
00:03:59,399 --> 00:04:01,398
I don't know where he is.

40
00:04:01,399 --> 00:04:02,399
He is Azaad.

41
00:04:02,817 --> 00:04:05,399
Must be trying to get about
change somewhere.

42
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:10,399
Not again, Sameer.
Can you be of some help?

43
00:04:11,399 --> 00:04:13,399
I'm leaving now. Meet me there.

44
00:04:15,399 --> 00:04:16,399
Ok.

45
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:42,399
The Express doesn't run on
your articles. C'mon, Vinod!

46
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:45,399
You send the articles, that's why
they print them.

47
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:52,399
They're happy to get a free
article every week.

48
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:54,399
Are you listening?

49
00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:58,399
If you don't ask for the money,
they'll never give it.

50
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:02,399
Not again, Zainab.

51
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:05,398
What's the big deal?

52
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:07,398
We're managing on our salaries.

53
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:12,398
And if I start writing for money,
I can never write the truth.

54
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:16,399
We need more money. Sameer
wants private tuitions.

55
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:20,399
- Must I...?
- Tuitions! Whatever for?

56
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:23,559
These private tuitions are a big scam,
I'm telling you!

57
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:25,399
Remember that!

58
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:29,398
Live in the real world. See
what's really going on.

59
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:30,817
You mean sell myself?

60
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:35,398
- No point talking.
- So don't talk.

61
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:37,399
So what's the solution?

62
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:41,398
Use your brains and study
on your own.

63
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:44,398
You don't get it. Kids are under
so much pressure.

64
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:46,399
Don't let the pressure get to you.

65
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:48,399
Everyone isn't like you.

66
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:52,398
You write about change and ignore
the reality around you.

67
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:54,399
If only everyone was like me.

68
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:05,398
I didn't have the password
so couldn't start the laptop.

69
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:07,398
But I brought it anyway.

70
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:10,399
These are the books that he was
reading.

71
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:15,399
His employer's ID.

72
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:19,398
What is this?

73
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:21,399
God is not Great.

74
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:24,399
Good Muslim, Bad Muslim.

75
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:26,399
What is this?

76
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:28,399
Get me some tea.

77
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,399
Anything else?

78
00:06:34,817 --> 00:06:36,399
Sir, the money.

79
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:45,399
When can we expect him home?

80
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:50,398
You investing in the stock market?

81
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:52,398
Is he in my pocket?

82
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:54,817
No sir, he didn't mean it like that.

83
00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:56,399
- He's worried.
- Worried?

84
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:00,398
Worried because he hasn't
spoken to his father?

85
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:02,399
When did you last speak to him?

86
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:06,399
Mr. Worried!

87
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:10,399
When was the last time?

88
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:14,399
We don't talk to each other much.

89
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:17,399
Meaning, what?

90
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:20,399
Sir, he lives in Delhi.

91
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:24,398
He's reading economics.
He's busy studying.

92
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:26,398
Where's my tea? Hurry!

93
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:27,399
He arrived today.

94
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:32,399
Zainabji, there are many police cases
against Vinod Durge.

95
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:36,398
See this? 17th March, 1995.

96
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:39,399
He assaulted Arun Vajani.
Non-cognizable offense. Article 323.

97
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:43,398
Another one. Article 427.
He broke the landlord's door.

98
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:45,817
Mr. Kulkarni, this incident
took place 20 years ago.

99
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:47,399
It wasn't Vinod's fault.

100
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:51,398
The landlord acted illegally.

101
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:53,399
The case was solved.

102
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:57,399
Maybe it was solved, but
it's still on our records.

103
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:00,398
There's a new case against him.

104
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:04,398
Sedition charges. Article 114.
About his writing.

105
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:07,398
Why must he write
controversial articles?

106
00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:09,399
Can't he write cheery things?

107
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:12,399
Get that tea!

108
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:13,399
Stop that!

109
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:19,399
Are you aware of your popularity?
After all, you are an icon!

110
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:27,399
Zainab tells me: "You write well
But, about bad things."

111
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:39,399
I write what I observe. About what
I see all around me.

112
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:41,399
I write about that.

113
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:47,399
Some people read my articles,
others are angered by them.

114
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:53,398
What can I say? That's it.

115
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:56,399
How do you feel when people
get angry?

116
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:04,398
Saadat Hasan Manto Saab
put it very beautifully:

117
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:11,817
"If you can't bear my writings, then
we're living in unbearable times."

118
00:09:14,817 --> 00:09:17,398
So... yeah.

119
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:19,817
Even Manto felt scared at times.

120
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:22,399
Do you feel scared?

121
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:35,399
Last month someone smashed
our car windscreen.

122
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:39,399
The first thought that
crossed my mind was...

123
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,399
what if Zainab was in the car?

124
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:53,398
So... yes.

125
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:55,399
I do feel scared.

126
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:57,399
And angry?

127
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:02,399
I write.

128
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:19,399
Sameer, come.

129
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:31,399
The documentary filmmakers
have sent the footage.

130
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,399
What is it?

131
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:55,399
Don't you know?

132
00:10:58,399 --> 00:10:59,399
It's his old habit.

133
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:02,399
All thanks to you!

134
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,399
He does what the hell he wants.

135
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:13,559
Comes and goes as he pleases.

136
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:17,399
And we just take it.

137
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,399
It's been a month.

138
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:25,399
Has he bothered to fix
the car windscreen?

139
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:27,399
No!

140
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:33,399
He calls himself "Azaad."

141
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,399
Is this 'azaadi' (freedom)?

142
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:45,399
See the state of the house.

143
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:48,399
You hear me, Ma?

144
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:51,398
We don't deserve this.
You don't deserve this.

145
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:53,399
- I'm fed up.
- No, I'm fed up, Sameer.

146
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:55,399
Of your anger.

147
00:11:55,399 --> 00:11:56,399
I'm fed up.

148
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,399
He's your father, not your enemy.

149
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:03,399
Wow!

150
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:07,399
He causes the problem, and I
have to hear this.

151
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,399
Don't listen. No one is
forcing you.

152
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,399
I made a mistake asking
you to come here.

153
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:19,399
Book your ticket and
go back to Delhi.

154
00:12:19,817 --> 00:12:22,398
Sure! Why don't I go to
London instead?

155
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,399
Sameer!

156
00:12:57,399 --> 00:12:58,399
Arsehole!

157
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:02,399
Hang on!

158
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:43,398
I made a mistake asking
you to come here.

159
00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:47,399
Book your ticket and
go back to Delhi.

160
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,399
We don't talk to each other much.

161
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,399
You moron! You crazy?
Is that how you drive?

162
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,399
They've come to interview
your father.

163
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:49,399
We'll eat when they take
a break.

164
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,399
You tell me, how's
the Delhi winter?

165
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:58,399
Ma, actually, I wanted to
tell you something.

166
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,399
Last time, Daddy didn't say
anything, but...

167
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:06,399
I've applied to the
London School.

168
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:12,399
And, I've got admission.

169
00:15:13,817 --> 00:15:16,399
They're giving me a
60% scholarship too.

170
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:19,399
Wow! Congratulations!

171
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:24,399
I don't know why but
I always thought...

172
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:27,039
you'd become a writer
like your father.

173
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:35,399
Ma! You imagine anything.

174
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,399
So, I wanted to ask...

175
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:42,399
So can we...

176
00:15:43,399 --> 00:15:46,399
take a loan for the
remaining 40%? Please?

177
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:53,399
A loan?

178
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:59,398
You know him. He won't take
money from anybody.

179
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:02,817
Great! Same story again.
OK. I'll work it out.

180
00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:05,399
Why do you get angry so quickly?
I'm just saying.

181
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,399
Ma, it's ok.

182
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,817
Wait. Give him the good news
yourself.

183
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:12,399
No, Ma. No. It's ok.

184
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:19,399
Ma, please.

185
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:22,398
- Sorry for interrupting.
- Not now. What are you doing?

186
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,398
It's Sameer. He wants to talk
to you.

187
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,399
Ma, please, I don't want to
talk to him.

188
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:48,399
Sir, tea? Coffee?

189
00:19:01,399 --> 00:19:03,398
'Amid the night's noise'
was your first article?

190
00:19:03,399 --> 00:19:04,399
Yes.

191
00:19:05,399 --> 00:19:08,399
17th March, 1995.

192
00:19:11,399 --> 00:19:14,399
Our landlord had thrown us
out of the house.

193
00:19:17,399 --> 00:19:24,399
Because he suddenly realized
that my wife was a Muslim.

194
00:19:25,399 --> 00:19:31,399
Muslims were not allowed
to live in that building.

195
00:19:34,399 --> 00:19:36,399
So he threw us out.

196
00:19:38,399 --> 00:19:40,399
It was late at night.

197
00:19:41,399 --> 00:19:44,399
All our belongings were
scattered on the road.

198
00:19:48,399 --> 00:19:50,399
Zainab was pregnant.

199
00:19:54,399 --> 00:19:56,399
That night...

200
00:19:59,399 --> 00:20:02,399
she delivered our son
on the road.

201
00:20:07,399 --> 00:20:10,399
I was furious.

202
00:20:11,399 --> 00:20:17,399
I was angry with Vajani, with the other
tenants, with everyone.

203
00:20:20,399 --> 00:20:22,399
But, then...

204
00:20:27,399 --> 00:20:28,817
I looked at Sameer.

205
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:35,399
And I thought to myself...

206
00:20:37,399 --> 00:20:42,399
which world do I want
to show my son?

207
00:20:46,399 --> 00:20:52,399
A world that chains
itself with borders.

208
00:20:55,399 --> 00:21:03,399
Or the world that is far away
from all the noise...

209
00:21:05,399 --> 00:21:09,399
on the other side
of that tiny bridge.

210
00:21:14,399 --> 00:21:16,399
That world.

211
00:21:18,399 --> 00:21:20,399
Which world did I want
to show him?

212
00:21:26,399 --> 00:21:32,399
You asked me if I feel scared.

213
00:21:34,399 --> 00:21:35,399
I do.

214
00:21:41,399 --> 00:21:48,399
We can block the noise from outside
by closing our doors and windows.

215
00:21:50,399 --> 00:21:54,398
But what about the noise
within us?

216
00:21:54,399 --> 00:22:00,399
The noise of religion, class,
social divide, poor, rich.

217
00:22:02,399 --> 00:22:07,399
I battle this noise every single day.

218
00:22:08,399 --> 00:22:16,399
But I feel scared. What if
this noise defeats me some day?

219
00:22:23,234 --> 00:22:24,399
I do fear that.

220
00:22:31,399 --> 00:22:34,399
I started writing for Sameer.

221
00:22:36,399 --> 00:22:39,399
Azaad writes for Sameer.

222
00:22:41,399 --> 00:22:42,399
Sorry for interrupting.

223
00:22:43,399 --> 00:22:46,399
Sameer's on the phone.
He wants to talk to you.

224
00:22:47,399 --> 00:22:48,399
What are you doing?

225
00:22:49,399 --> 00:22:52,399
Ma, please, I don't want to
talk to him.

226
00:23:38,399 --> 00:23:40,399
You're still awake?

227
00:23:45,399 --> 00:23:46,399
I couldn't sleep.

228
00:23:50,399 --> 00:23:52,399
Why don't you sleep, Ma?

229
00:23:57,399 --> 00:23:58,399
I was thinking...

230
00:23:59,399 --> 00:24:02,399
I'll go and see Kulkarni
again tomorrow.

231
00:24:05,399 --> 00:24:07,399
I'll also stop by the Express office.

232
00:24:12,399 --> 00:24:14,399
If we put more pressure,
they'll find him sooner.

233
00:24:16,399 --> 00:24:18,399
Ok, get some rest now.

234
00:24:45,399 --> 00:24:47,399
Yes, Mr. Kulkarni?

235
00:25:14,399 --> 00:25:16,399
Yes, I've called them.

236
00:25:17,399 --> 00:25:18,439
They came to me yesterday.

237
00:25:19,399 --> 00:25:21,399
His whole family is
looking for him.

238
00:25:22,399 --> 00:25:24,399
I just reached.

239
00:25:30,399 --> 00:25:31,817
His son is here.
Talk to you later.

240
00:25:41,399 --> 00:25:44,399
We found these papers
in his bag.

241
00:25:52,399 --> 00:25:53,399
Education?

242
00:25:57,399 --> 00:26:01,399
The cyber cell retrieved some
emails from his laptop.

243
00:26:03,399 --> 00:26:04,399
Threat emails.

244
00:26:06,399 --> 00:26:08,399
He's had them for 3 months.

245
00:26:10,399 --> 00:26:13,399
I'll explain. Come.

246
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:33,399
We have to take the body
for the post-mortem.

247
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:36,817
Get an ambulance
from Thakur Hospital...

248
00:27:37,399 --> 00:27:39,399
send two constables there.

249
00:27:43,399 --> 00:27:46,399
Send one man here.

250
00:28:49,399 --> 00:28:52,399
The stains of blood
on the floor.

251
00:28:53,399 --> 00:28:56,399
The smell of corpses
in that lane.

252
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:03,399
Over these existing borders
a few more are drawn.

253
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:16,399
Those are your quarters.
The others belong to me.

254
00:29:19,399 --> 00:29:20,817
New treasures are won.

255
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:25,399
Some by me, some by you.

256
00:29:33,399 --> 00:29:34,559
Neither did you step forward,

257
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:37,399
Nor did I show my face.

258
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:45,399
You could not understand
some things.

259
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:48,399
I could not explain some things.

260
00:29:55,399 --> 00:29:57,399
How did those relations break?

261
00:29:59,399 --> 00:30:02,399
What were all those promises?

262
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:11,399
Those moments of silence.

263
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:17,399
The intentions of that noise.

264
00:46:02,399 --> 00:46:03,399
Change.

265
00:46:04,399 --> 00:46:06,399
We have the room for exactly 8 hours.

266
00:46:07,399 --> 00:46:10,399
They're very strict.

267
00:48:22,399 --> 00:48:23,399
Where did you find this?

268
00:48:25,399 --> 00:48:29,399
If you wanted sound
why did you check in here?

269
00:48:30,399 --> 00:48:34,399
It's too quiet.
It bothered me.

270
00:48:35,399 --> 00:48:38,399
But you chose a silent room.

271
00:48:39,399 --> 00:48:42,399
I've never heard such silence.

272
00:48:43,399 --> 00:48:46,399
Does it seem natural to you?
It's unnatural.

273
00:48:47,399 --> 00:48:48,399
Never mind.

274
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:53,399
Go fill a new form for
indoor ambience.

275
00:48:58,399 --> 00:49:02,399
I can destroy this,
or I can report it.

276
00:49:04,817 --> 00:49:05,817
What do I do?

277
00:49:24,234 --> 00:49:27,399
I'd better go to the bathroom
or I'll disturb you all at night.

278
00:49:34,399 --> 00:49:35,399
Is it time?

279
00:49:36,817 --> 00:49:39,399
Five minutes.
I'll call home and say good night.

280
00:49:47,399 --> 00:49:48,399
Hello?

281
00:49:50,399 --> 00:49:55,398
Hello! Can you hear me?

282
00:49:55,399 --> 00:49:57,399
Can you hear me?

283
00:51:25,399 --> 00:51:27,399
You chose indoor ambience.

284
00:51:28,399 --> 00:51:31,399
I just wanted something normal.

285
00:51:32,399 --> 00:51:34,398
All our sounds are normal.

286
00:51:34,399 --> 00:51:37,398
Indoor ambient number 56
at 20 decibels.

287
00:51:37,399 --> 00:51:41,398
20 decibels, exactly! It's not normal.
Do you even remember normal?

288
00:51:41,399 --> 00:51:44,399
Your tone is above 60 decibels.

289
00:51:49,399 --> 00:51:52,399
This is not normal.

290
00:51:55,399 --> 00:51:56,399
Get up.

291
00:52:16,399 --> 00:52:17,399
You like that?

292
00:52:19,399 --> 00:52:21,399
Does it matter?

293
00:52:41,399 --> 00:52:42,399
Where are you from?

294
00:52:44,399 --> 00:52:45,399
The eastern province?

295
00:52:47,399 --> 00:52:48,399
When did you move?

296
00:52:49,399 --> 00:52:50,399
Two months ago.

297
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:52,399
After the war...

298
00:52:55,399 --> 00:52:56,399
The East is peaceful now?

299
00:53:01,399 --> 00:53:05,398
And now you're here
and you cannot sleep.

300
00:53:05,399 --> 00:53:09,398
Not much.
I get nightmares.

301
00:53:09,399 --> 00:53:13,399
In your nightmares, you scream
but nobody hears you.

302
00:53:15,399 --> 00:53:16,399
How do you know?

303
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:21,399
Lina, I can't help you.

304
00:53:23,399 --> 00:53:27,399
There's one place... But...

305
00:53:41,399 --> 00:53:42,399
Good!

306
00:54:17,399 --> 00:54:19,398
What do you want?

307
00:54:19,399 --> 00:54:22,399
Look, if I don't have it,
nobody has it.

308
00:54:23,399 --> 00:54:25,399
I have the biggest
sound library in town.

309
00:54:32,399 --> 00:54:33,399
Seen this?

310
00:54:43,399 --> 00:54:44,399
A CD?

311
00:54:45,399 --> 00:54:46,399
Where did you find it?

312
00:54:48,399 --> 00:54:51,817
My Dad had bought it
Can you play it?

313
00:55:00,399 --> 00:55:03,399
Never thought I'd hear a CD.

314
00:55:17,399 --> 00:55:19,399
I want all that.

315
00:55:26,399 --> 00:55:29,399
What's this?

316
00:55:30,399 --> 00:55:32,399
A bed.

317
00:55:33,399 --> 00:55:34,399
Bed?

318
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:36,399
You slept on wood?

319
00:55:37,399 --> 00:55:41,399
Everyone slept on wood
even after the New Rules.

320
00:55:42,399 --> 00:55:44,399
I've never even seen a wooden bed.

321
00:55:48,399 --> 00:55:50,398
Wow! This is all illegal.

322
00:55:50,399 --> 00:55:52,398
You know it's all above 90, right?

323
00:55:52,399 --> 00:55:53,399
Do you care?

324
00:55:54,399 --> 00:55:55,399
Not me.

325
00:56:21,399 --> 00:56:24,398
Amazing! Who made this?

326
00:56:24,399 --> 00:56:26,398
When the New Rules came into force...

327
00:56:26,399 --> 00:56:28,399
the black market was flooded
with these CDs.

328
00:56:36,399 --> 00:56:39,399
Sh. What's that?

329
00:56:40,399 --> 00:56:41,399
A swing.

330
00:56:45,399 --> 00:56:46,399
Swing?

331
00:56:47,399 --> 00:56:52,398
There are two chains
with a plank between them.

332
00:56:52,399 --> 00:56:57,399
You can sit or stand.
It's great fun.

333
00:57:08,399 --> 00:57:10,399
No, not that.

334
00:57:15,399 --> 00:57:18,399
I don't want this.

335
00:57:25,399 --> 00:57:28,399
This is the worst sound ever.

336
00:57:30,399 --> 00:57:32,399
They wear different boots...

337
00:57:33,399 --> 00:57:36,399
Now you can't hear them coming.

338
00:57:39,399 --> 00:57:41,399
You want this?

339
00:58:01,399 --> 00:58:02,399
Thank you.

340
00:58:05,399 --> 00:58:07,399
I don't take cards. Too risky.

341
00:58:13,399 --> 00:58:15,399
Where do I get so much cash?

342
00:58:19,399 --> 00:58:21,399
Why don't I just keep this?

343
00:58:25,399 --> 00:58:28,399
What will you do with a CD?
CDs are obsolete.

344
00:58:28,817 --> 00:58:30,399
So are wooden beds.

345
00:58:31,399 --> 00:58:34,399
What will you do
with this old noise?

346
00:58:36,399 --> 00:58:38,039
These are my memories.
Give it back to me.

347
00:58:38,399 --> 00:58:39,399
I want it too.

348
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:41,399
You can copy it.

349
00:58:42,399 --> 00:58:43,399
I can copy it.

350
00:58:45,399 --> 00:58:46,399
This is my first CD.

351
00:58:47,399 --> 00:58:49,039
I'm not giving it to you.
- I'll break it.

352
00:59:40,399 --> 00:59:41,399
Ever since I had a baby...

353
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:44,398
I realized my skin was ageing
much faster than I was.

354
00:59:44,399 --> 00:59:46,398
Then I discovered this magical cream!

355
00:59:46,399 --> 00:59:49,399
Forever Baby Young!
Because your skin deserves it!

356
00:59:54,399 --> 00:59:58,398
I have told you people so many times
not to ring the bell at this hour!

357
00:59:58,399 --> 01:00:00,399
Don't want it nothing from you
Get out!!

358
01:00:13,399 --> 01:00:14,399
Hello

359
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:16,399

Sir, in today's times, one can manage
without bread, clothes, home, girlfriend...

405
01:02:44,399 --> 01:02:46,398

is indispensible!

Sir I will get you such a mobile connection
that won't ever get disconnected...

407
01:02:49,399 --> 01:02:50,719

01:02:51,399 --> 01:02:52,399

409
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:54,398

You haven't!

413
01:03:07,399 --> 01:03:09,398
Never mind Sir, let me explain.

414
01:03:09,399 --> 01:03:12,398
We are the best telecom
service providers in India.

415
01:03:12,399 --> 01:03:14,398

I mean we only send
soft copies you see!

420
01:03:27,399 --> 01:03:30,399
Oh you Pistachio representatives

01:03:31,399 --> 01:03:33,398
Pistachio promised that
they will send me a soft copy...

422
01:03:33,399 --> 01:03:36,399
You conveniently didn't... and now you
are penalizing me for late payment?

423
01:03:37,399 --> 01:03:38,479
Who activated my data pack?

424
01:03:39,399 --> 01:03:40,399

427
01:03:46,399 --> 01:03:49,398
Damn I don't even own a smart phone
why will I need a data pack?

428
01:03:49,399 --> 01:03:51,399
No way... Excuse me gentleman.
I will sue you!

429

customer like this.

You are making me wait past half hour.

431
01:03:55,399 --> 01:03:58,319
I don't understand if I don't have a
smart phone why would I buy any data?

432
01:04:03,399 --> 01:04:05,398
Sir, we have a vast subscriber base...

01:09:10,399 --> 01:09:12,398

Till the Customer is deaf to the bray

564
01:09:54,399 --> 01:09:58,398
Peek a boo peek a
boo is the game they play

565
01:09:58,399 --> 01:10:02,398
Peek a boo peek a
boo is the game they play

566
01:10:02,399 --> 01:10:04,398
Hello Hello!

567
01:10:04,399 --> 01:10:07,399

568
01:10:08,399 --> 01:10:14,399

569
01:10:15,399 --> 01:10:20,398
Promised the false greed, trumped like
a pack of cards Customer is shuffled

570
01:10:20,399 --> 01:10:22,398
Every card thrown is an ace

571
01:10:22,399 --> 01:10:25,398
Every card thrown is an ace

572
01:10:25,399 --> 01:10:28,399
All fifty-twos are
thrown to win the race

573
01:10:29,234 --> 01:10:31,398

574
01:10:31,399 --> 01:10:33,398

Till the Customer is deaf to the bray

585
01:11:59,399 --> 01:12:01,399
Peek a boo peek a
boo is the game they play

586
01:13:05,399 --> 01:13:06,399
Who is it?

587
01:14:00,399 --> 01:14:02,399
Any special request
for your last meal?

588
01:14:03,399 --> 01:14:04,399
Hmm?

589
01:14:06,399 --> 01:14:08,399
Care for some Biryani?

590
01:14:12,399 --> 01:14:14,399
No, no food.

591
01:14:15,399 --> 01:14:16,559
I don't want to eat anything.

592
01:14:19,399 --> 01:14:22,399
If you want to offer a last prayer,
it can be arranged.

593
01:14:29,399 --> 01:14:31,399
For me you are God here.

594
01:14:37,399 --> 01:14:38,399
Just once...

595
01:14:44,399 --> 01:14:45,399
Please, once...

596
01:16:52,399 --> 01:16:53,399
Sign here.

597
01:16:59,399 --> 01:17:04,399
Will you have me sign even my last
document through this door, Prakash Sir?

598
01:17:15,399 --> 01:17:16,399
Sign here.

599
01:17:18,399 --> 01:17:19,399
Aren't you scared?

600
01:17:25,399 --> 01:17:26,399
Sign.

601
01:17:29,399 --> 01:17:31,399
Can anything be done now?

602
01:17:39,399 --> 01:17:41,399
Ten years and not a single response.

603
01:17:46,399 --> 01:17:48,399
Do you hate me that much?

604
01:17:54,399 --> 01:17:59,399
Very soon, I know you will
think of me, at least once.

605
01:18:03,399 --> 01:18:05,399
Do you want to inform anyone?

606
01:18:09,399 --> 01:18:12,399
Inform whoever you
want to... inform everyone.

607
01:18:23,399 --> 01:18:24,817
Thank you!

608
01:18:30,399 --> 01:18:31,399
24th March

609
01:18:34,399 --> 01:18:35,399
24th March

610
01:19:43,399 --> 01:19:46,399
It's for your own good, old man.

611
01:19:47,399 --> 01:19:50,399
You know, the noose is made
according to the body weight.

612
01:19:51,399 --> 01:19:56,399
Even if it's slightly off,
the neck does not snap easily.

613
01:19:57,399 --> 01:20:01,399
Then you will keep hanging,
choking and twitching for a long time.

614
01:20:04,399 --> 01:20:05,399
Out!

615
01:20:06,399 --> 01:20:07,399
Out!

616
01:20:24,399 --> 01:20:26,399
Can anything be done...

617
01:20:29,399 --> 01:20:31,399
It's just a small request.

618
01:20:45,399 --> 01:20:46,399
Thank you!

619
01:20:48,399 --> 01:20:50,399
Thank you.

620
01:21:38,399 --> 01:21:40,399
24th March?

621
01:22:24,399 --> 01:22:25,399
Sir...

622
01:22:27,399 --> 01:22:29,399
Please, give me a minute.

623
01:28:05,399 --> 01:28:08,398
The bee-like buzz of her headphones
was the closest she'd come to silence

624
01:28:08,399 --> 01:28:10,398
His dreams were his
daily dose of colour,

625
01:28:10,399 --> 01:28:14,399
And what's to follow is a collection
of their favourite anecdotes

626
01:28:52,399 --> 01:28:55,398
She walked and she walked
and he cycled and he cycled

627
01:28:55,399 --> 01:28:58,398
he left crossword trails and
she thought of words that alliterated

628
01:28:58,399 --> 01:29:00,398
she lived in silence and
he lived in black and white

629
01:29:00,399 --> 01:29:01,399
and their roads were parallel

630
01:29:01,400 --> 01:29:05,398
but unknown to anyone the
roads kept coming closer and closer

631
01:29:05,399 --> 01:29:06,399
'why?' they will never know

632
01:29:06,400 --> 01:29:09,399
28kms below them, the tectonic plates
shifted ever so slightly

633
01:29:10,399 --> 01:29:11,399
everyday till the two roads were one

634
01:29:11,400 --> 01:29:13,398
97 days later, two political parties

635
01:29:13,399 --> 01:29:15,398
fought over the name of the new road

636
01:29:15,399 --> 01:29:16,399
but that's another story

637
01:29:17,399 --> 01:29:18,399
It was a usual day in June

638
01:29:18,400 --> 01:29:21,398
Temperature -30 degrees,
Humidity-58 percent

639
01:29:21,399 --> 01:29:22,399
No forecast of rain

640
01:29:22,400 --> 01:29:24,399
A day perfect for
lime green paper planes

641
01:29:25,399 --> 01:29:27,399
She was thinking about the
tiny purse she had when she was small,

642
01:29:27,817 --> 01:29:30,398
exactly the size of her palm,
as if tailored to fit

643
01:29:30,399 --> 01:29:32,398
He thought about a city of dodo birds

644
01:29:32,399 --> 01:29:34,398
and if extinct animals
and extinct languages

645
01:29:34,399 --> 01:29:35,839
all go in one box labeled 'extinct'?

646
01:31:00,399 --> 01:31:01,399
That night he found
a pair of earlier white,

647
01:31:01,400 --> 01:31:04,398
now faded brown canvas
shoes from school

648
01:31:04,399 --> 01:31:06,398
which he was sure he had
thrown away a long time ago

649
01:31:06,399 --> 01:31:08,399
And her pillow smelt of star anise

650
01:31:23,399 --> 01:31:27,399
You can speak...
I won't be able to hear anything.

651
01:31:29,399 --> 01:31:31,399
There's a place where there's no sound.

652
01:31:36,399 --> 01:31:39,398
She was sure such a place
didn't exist in the city

653
01:31:39,399 --> 01:31:40,399
but decided to not say it

654
01:31:58,399 --> 01:31:59,399
When I...

655
01:32:03,399 --> 01:32:04,399
Now?

656
01:32:08,399 --> 01:32:09,399
Now?

657
01:32:09,400 --> 01:32:11,681
And then she discovered
that his voice had the rare talent

658
01:32:12,399 --> 01:32:13,399
of not piercing her ears

659
01:32:13,400 --> 01:32:18,399
Whenever I see a colour
for example, blue

660
01:32:19,399 --> 01:32:21,399
Then all the blue things
I've seen in my life

661
01:32:22,399 --> 01:32:24,399
flash in front of my eyes

662
01:32:26,399 --> 01:32:27,399
almost like a film

663
01:32:28,399 --> 01:32:32,399
which I can't stop till I've
thought of all those blue things

664
01:32:33,399 --> 01:32:34,559
It's a little strange, right?

665
01:32:35,817 --> 01:32:37,399
It's called Synesthesia

666
01:32:38,817 --> 01:32:41,399
The sensory nerves
in my brain are overlapping

667
01:32:43,399 --> 01:32:44,817
There are many types of Synesthesia

668
01:32:45,399 --> 01:32:47,399
but Google says that
mine is the most unique

669
01:32:49,399 --> 01:32:51,399
Which is why, these

670
01:33:01,399 --> 01:33:03,398
In that moment she thought
of him as an astronaut

671
01:33:03,399 --> 01:33:06,398
gliding though black and
white galaxies but for some reason

672
01:33:06,399 --> 01:33:07,839
wearing a glittering orange seatbelt

673
01:33:08,399 --> 01:33:11,399
That film in my brain
kept getting longer

674
01:33:12,399 --> 01:33:14,234
as my memories kept growing

675
01:34:01,399 --> 01:34:03,398
That night she thought of blue
and then she thought of indigo

676
01:34:03,399 --> 01:34:05,398
and when she thought of indigo
she thought of turquoise

677
01:34:05,399 --> 01:34:08,398
and ink blue and cobalt
and Persian blue and Oxford blue

678
01:34:08,399 --> 01:34:09,399
and midnight blue and cyan

679
01:34:09,400 --> 01:34:11,399
and azure and teal and sapphire.

680
01:34:39,399 --> 01:34:41,399
Open your eyes

681
01:34:45,399 --> 01:34:49,398
This was the precise moment
that replayed in his head 12670 times

682
01:34:49,399 --> 01:34:52,398
Seeing her in black and white
was as if world had agreed to

683
01:34:52,399 --> 01:34:54,398
play itself out in the
only colour he could see

684
01:34:54,399 --> 01:34:56,399
And this was the exact
moment when she spoke

685
01:34:57,399 --> 01:35:00,398
Words tumbled out of her mouth
like a dictionary had become liquid

686
01:35:00,399 --> 01:35:02,398
She spoke but she
couldn't hear herself

687
01:35:02,399 --> 01:35:04,398
She spoke and he could hear her

688
01:35:04,399 --> 01:35:06,398
She spoke about exams that
she didn't want to cheat in

689
01:35:06,399 --> 01:35:08,519
but heard answers being
whispered in another classroom

690
01:35:09,399 --> 01:35:11,398
She spoke about her eardrums
which were thinner than grapeskin

691
01:35:11,399 --> 01:35:14,398
She spoke about the fruit
that she'd only tasted once-

692
01:35:14,399 --> 01:35:16,398
both a plum and tomato at same time

693
01:35:16,399 --> 01:35:18,398
She spoke like language
won't exist tomorrow

694
01:35:18,399 --> 01:35:20,399
She spoke till she was out of breath

695
01:35:57,399 --> 01:36:00,398
That night he thought of all the
tin can telephones of his childhood

696
01:36:00,399 --> 01:36:01,399
that never quite worked.

697
01:36:01,400 --> 01:36:04,398
She thought of tin roofs,
cans, canned peaches,

698
01:36:04,399 --> 01:36:07,398
phone companies and two lovers
one in Paris, one in Jaipur

699
01:36:07,399 --> 01:36:09,398
talking to each other through
a wireless tin can telephone

700
01:36:09,399 --> 01:36:12,399
Not everyone dreams in colour

701
01:36:13,399 --> 01:36:17,398
12 percent people can
only see black and white dreams

702
01:36:17,399 --> 01:36:21,398
If you could see only one
colour, which one would you choose?

703
01:36:21,399 --> 01:36:22,399
Blue

704
01:36:23,399 --> 01:36:27,399
How do butterflies taste their food?

705
01:36:28,399 --> 01:36:29,399
With their feet

706
01:38:07,399 --> 01:38:09,399
I dream of the sea

707
01:38:10,399 --> 01:38:13,399
but I don't know why
it's always in black and white

708
01:38:14,399 --> 01:38:16,399
I've never been on a train

709
01:38:17,399 --> 01:38:22,399
If I do, my eardrums will burst

710
01:38:24,399 --> 01:38:27,399
And then he traded the sound of
his dreams with the colour of hers

711
01:38:28,399 --> 01:38:30,399
The tectonic plates
remained unaccredited

712
01:40:34,817 --> 01:40:36,398
Mia

713
01:40:36,399 --> 01:40:38,399
Mumma has called.

714
01:40:42,399 --> 01:40:43,399
Mia

715
01:40:44,399 --> 01:40:46,399
She has been calling since morning.

716
01:42:23,399 --> 01:42:24,399
Hey

717
01:42:24,400 --> 01:42:26,399
I am Gino.

718
01:42:28,399 --> 01:42:30,399
I have never seen you before.

719
01:42:35,399 --> 01:42:37,399
I know something about you

720
01:43:03,399 --> 01:43:05,399
You said you know something

721
01:43:07,399 --> 01:43:08,399
What do you know?

722
01:43:10,399 --> 01:43:11,399
Okay

723
01:43:11,400 --> 01:43:14,399

730
01:43:42,399 --> 01:43:44,398
Alright, enough of the suspense.

731
01:43:44,399 --> 01:43:46,399
I'm gonna tell you what I know.

732
01:43:47,399 --> 01:43:49,119
I know you have earphones
under that hood...

733
01:43:49,399 --> 01:43:51,398
and you listen
to music in the church.

734
01:43:51,399 --> 01:43:52,399
What?

735
01:43:52,400 --> 01:43:56,398
You have earphones under that hood
and you listen to music in the church.

736
01:43:56,399 --> 01:43:59,399
That's not good. Shouldn't do that.

737
01:44:01,399 --> 01:44:04,399
You will feel your self complete

738
01:44:05,399 --> 01:44:09,398
You will finally find what you need ya

739
01:44:09,399 --> 01:44:15,399
If you can find the
peace in a troubled soul..

740
01:44:16,399 --> 01:44:19,399
You will finally feel hope...

741
01:44:20,399 --> 01:44:23,398
You finally feel like you belong..

742
01:44:23,399 --> 01:44:30,398

Said you can find the beauty
in a moonlight...

748
01:45:01,399 --> 01:45:05,399
Or you find that everything
goes so right no...

749
01:45:47,399 --> 01:45:49,399
Why are you recording this?

750
01:45:51,399 --> 01:45:54,399
So that I can see
you whenever I want to.

751
01:45:55,399 --> 01:45:57,399
Put that away.

752
01:45:58,400 --> 01:46:01,399
It's just between us two.

753
01:46:04,399 --> 01:46:06,399
C'mon...

754
01:46:08,399 --> 01:46:10,399
I love your hair so much.

755
01:46:12,399 --> 01:46:13,399
Your eyes.

756
01:46:16,399 --> 01:46:17,399
Your lips.

757
01:46:18,817 --> 01:46:20,398
The way you laugh

758
01:46:20,399 --> 01:46:22,399
And what else?

759
01:46:24,399 --> 01:46:26,399
Your tattoos.

760
01:46:27,399 --> 01:46:28,817
Which one?

761
01:46:29,400 --> 01:46:31,398
The one that you got for me.

762
01:46:31,399 --> 01:46:33,399
I didn't get a tattoo for you.

763
01:46:34,399 --> 01:46:35,399
C'mon... Show it to me.

764
01:46:46,399 --> 01:46:49,398
Rohan... Put that away.

765
01:46:49,399 --> 01:46:50,399
Trust me.

766
01:46:51,399 --> 01:46:52,399
I love you...

767
01:49:28,399 --> 01:49:30,399
Didn't you say that you loved my hair

768
01:49:31,399 --> 01:49:34,399
I thought you would forever care

769
01:49:35,399 --> 01:49:36,399
Now look what you did

770
01:49:37,399 --> 01:49:40,399
You left me to deal with all this shit

771
01:49:42,399 --> 01:49:45,399
Wait... don't judge me yet

772
01:49:46,399 --> 01:49:49,398
Yeah that was me, yeah that was you

773
01:49:49,399 --> 01:49:51,399
Remember when you
said that you were true?

774
01:49:52,399 --> 01:49:55,398
You said the moment was between us two

775
01:49:55,399 --> 01:49:58,398
You read the comments
that the people threw?

776
01:49:58,399 --> 01:49:59,399
I had to even go bald

777
01:49:59,400 --> 01:50:00,480
My mom and dad were my wall

778
01:50:01,399 --> 01:50:04,398
But the tape that you made.
Has shattered it all

779
01:50:04,399 --> 01:50:06,399
Where are you daddy
when I needed your hand?

780
01:50:06,400 --> 01:50:10,399
You believed everybody
but didn't understand

781
01:50:11,399 --> 01:50:12,399
It was a mistake daddy

782
01:50:12,400 --> 01:50:14,398
You sent me so far away

783
01:50:14,399 --> 01:50:18,398
I'm sorry;
don't I matter to you anymore?

784
01:50:18,399 --> 01:50:20,399
This is because of you Rohan!!

785
01:50:22,399 --> 01:50:25,398
I get insane from the
noises....inside of my head

786
01:50:25,399 --> 01:50:28,398
Rohan I hate you for
what's left... inside of my head

787
01:50:28,399 --> 01:50:31,398
I hate the pain and the
voices... inside of my head

788
01:50:31,399 --> 01:50:34,398
A living ghost in this world...
coz inside I'm dead

789
01:50:34,399 --> 01:50:37,398
I get insane from the noises...
inside of my head

790
01:50:37,399 --> 01:50:39,479
Rohan I hate you for what's left...
inside of my head

791
01:50:40,399 --> 01:50:43,398
I hate the pain and the voices...
inside of my head

792
01:50:43,399 --> 01:50:46,398
A living ghost in this world...
coz inside I'm dead

793
01:50:46,399 --> 01:50:48,398
I can't believe what you wrote...
on my wall

794
01:50:48,399 --> 01:50:50,398
You didn't know me at all, I guess

795
01:50:50,399 --> 01:50:52,399
From the rest, you're no different

796
01:50:53,399 --> 01:50:55,398
And now you're ashamed
to call me your friend

797
01:50:55,399 --> 01:50:57,398
When you followed the trend?

798
01:50:57,399 --> 01:50:58,399
But no blame!!

799
01:50:59,399 --> 01:51:01,398
I suffocate living in fear

800
01:51:01,399 --> 01:51:04,398
Hiding away this girl called Mia

801
01:51:04,399 --> 01:51:07,398
Home was no longer the place..
What it should

802
01:51:07,399 --> 01:51:10,398
The safest place was.. under the hood

803
01:51:10,399 --> 01:51:13,398
I get insane from the noises....
inside of my head

804
01:51:13,399 --> 01:51:16,398
Rohan I hate you for what's left...
inside of my head

805
01:51:16,399 --> 01:51:19,398
I hate the pain and the voices...
inside of my head

806
01:51:19,399 --> 01:51:22,398
A living ghost in this world...
coz inside I'm dead

807
01:51:22,399 --> 01:51:25,398
I get insane from the noises...
inside of my head

808
01:51:25,399 --> 01:51:28,398
Rohan I hate you for what's left...
inside of my head

809
01:51:28,399 --> 01:51:31,398
I hate the pain and the voices...
inside of my head

810
01:51:31,399 --> 01:51:34,399
A living ghost in this world...
coz inside I'm dead

811
01:51:35,399 --> 01:51:37,399
I can't forgive you...

812
01:51:38,399 --> 01:51:40,398
I can't forget

813
01:51:40,399 --> 01:51:42,399
Because I loved you

814
01:51:43,399 --> 01:51:45,399
You took away my pride

815
01:51:46,399 --> 01:51:47,399
My song

816
01:51:48,399 --> 01:51:49,399
My soul

817
01:53:13,399 --> 01:53:16,399
Just a bald headed girl lost of word..

818
01:53:17,399 --> 01:53:21,398
Trying to make it through
One rhyme at a time..

819
01:53:21,399 --> 01:53:25,399
She's just a bald
headed girl lost of word

820
01:53:26,399 --> 01:53:30,399
Trying to make it through
One rhyme at a time..

821
01:53:31,399 --> 01:53:34,399
Keep looking up Ooh Yeah..

822
01:53:35,399 --> 01:53:39,398
Don't ever stop..
Don't ever lose all of your sense..

823
01:53:39,399 --> 01:53:43,234
With all that keeps going on..

824
01:53:43,399 --> 01:53:47,398
Keep your mind and
looking forward to dawn..

825
01:53:47,399 --> 01:53:52,399
If you find that he's alive
with the sound of the rhythmic feel..

826
01:53:53,399 --> 01:53:55,399
Just release and say to yourself..

827
01:53:56,399 --> 01:54:00,398
Open up to the breeze
and remind yourself...

828
01:54:00,399 --> 01:54:02,399
remind yourself

829
01:54:02,400 --> 01:54:07,398
I am freeee freeeee yaay...

830
01:54:07,399 --> 01:54:10,399
I am freeee freeeee yay..

831
01:54:11,399 --> 01:54:15,398
She's just a bald
headed girl lost of word

832
01:54:15,399 --> 01:54:19,399
Trying to make it through
One rhyme at a time..
