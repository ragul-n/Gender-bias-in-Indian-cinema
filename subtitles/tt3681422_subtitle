1
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:03,883
"Have you fallen in love
for a single kiss?"

2
00:05:03,967 --> 00:05:08,675
"Oh sensuous flower,
are you attracted?"

3
00:05:08,758 --> 00:05:12,675
"Have you fallen in love
for a single kiss?"

4
00:05:12,758 --> 00:05:17,592
"Oh sensuous flower,
are you attracted?"

5
00:05:17,675 --> 00:05:21,883
"Fallen in love for my
eyes and voice?"

6
00:05:21,967 --> 00:05:26,050
"Is it a soulful love or
neck deep love?"

7
00:05:26,175 --> 00:05:30,175
"Your single kiss is
enough to get lured"

8
00:05:30,258 --> 00:05:34,883
"In neck deep love,
my Casanova"

9
00:06:14,883 --> 00:06:19,175
"None can conquer
you in bed"

10
00:06:19,258 --> 00:06:23,508
"Your shadow is enough
to be lured"

11
00:06:23,592 --> 00:06:27,883
"You're an irresistible magnet"

12
00:06:27,967 --> 00:06:31,883
"Even a stone can
stick to you"

13
00:06:31,967 --> 00:06:36,383
"No peak is untouched by you"

14
00:06:36,508 --> 00:06:42,300
"I melted in love
at seeing you"

15
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:10,425
"Your single kiss is enough
to get lured"

16
00:07:10,508 --> 00:07:15,092
"In neck deep love,
my Casanova"

17
00:07:15,592 --> 00:07:17,592
"Our nights never end"

18
00:07:17,675 --> 00:07:19,758
"Hands become wings"

19
00:07:19,842 --> 00:07:22,092
"Forget your sleep"

20
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:23,883
"Is this called love?"

21
00:07:23,967 --> 00:07:27,925
"Your single kiss is enough
to get lured"

22
00:07:28,008 --> 00:07:33,133
"In neck deep love,
my Casanova"

23
00:08:08,592 --> 00:08:12,675
"You're the master of kisses"

24
00:08:12,758 --> 00:08:16,925
"None to beat you in kissing"

25
00:08:17,092 --> 00:08:25,633
"Kissing is the origin to ecstasy"

26
00:08:25,717 --> 00:08:29,967
"You're exploring me like
a scheming hunter"

27
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:35,925
"Will capture and topple you"

28
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:42,133
"Have you fallen in love
for a single kiss?"

29
00:08:42,217 --> 00:08:46,925
"Oh sensuous flower,
are you attracted?"

30
00:08:47,008 --> 00:08:51,508
"Fallen in love for
my eyes and voice?"

31
00:08:51,592 --> 00:08:57,342
"Is it a soulful love or
neck deep love?"

32
00:09:29,217 --> 00:09:30,383
Welcome...

33
00:09:30,467 --> 00:09:33,092
He's almost here

34
00:09:34,883 --> 00:09:37,133
Your...our...hero

35
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:40,008
- Invite the producer first
- Oh ok

36
00:09:40,092 --> 00:09:43,175
But first I'd like to
call up on the dais

37
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,675
...the godfather of film producers

38
00:09:45,758 --> 00:09:48,508
Mr.Manoranjan's father-in-law

39
00:09:48,592 --> 00:09:52,967
Mr.Poornachandra Rao

40
00:09:55,300 --> 00:10:00,508
- Hey Mano...look at grandpa!
- I've seen my grandpa mom

41
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:08,842
Ok, keep it!

42
00:10:11,217 --> 00:10:13,467
Give it to him after
the movie Ma

43
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:16,550
- A sip of this, my dear?
- Bad for health grandma

44
00:10:16,633 --> 00:10:20,508
God! It won't kill you
to act your age

45
00:10:20,675 --> 00:10:22,258
But that drink might

46
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,467
Your arrogance is the only thing
in common with your Dad

47
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:27,967
Atleast he is a film star

48
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:29,383
How dare you...?

49
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,842
- What do you say to that applause?
- That's just sound

50
00:10:53,258 --> 00:10:55,550
Maybe for you...
but it's their love

51
00:10:57,342 --> 00:10:58,717
Where are you off to?

52
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,925
Hey! He's got the phone!

53
00:11:02,383 --> 00:11:03,508
Let him go

54
00:11:08,217 --> 00:11:11,050
Hey...sound guy...

55
00:11:11,508 --> 00:11:13,467
Turn the volume down

56
00:11:13,967 --> 00:11:15,592
It's hurting my head

57
00:11:17,008 --> 00:11:18,717
Why're you guys cheering at that?

58
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,133
The film hasn't given
you a headache, right?

59
00:11:25,967 --> 00:11:27,508
- Chokku
- Sir?

60
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,175
- My head is aching
- Would you like a tablet?

61
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:34,592
- Where is my hip flask?
- Oh no! They did give it to me

62
00:11:34,675 --> 00:11:37,050
I forgot it at home

63
00:11:38,842 --> 00:11:40,175
I'm the actor

64
00:11:40,508 --> 00:11:42,842
You're the manager
Don't act with me

65
00:11:43,175 --> 00:11:46,050
I can't slip anything by you
I know this is nectar but...

66
00:11:46,133 --> 00:11:47,050
I know...it'll kill me

67
00:11:47,133 --> 00:11:49,467
Only in excess
Turn around...

68
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:51,467
It's medicine in the right doses

69
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:55,300
I know I don't have to remind you
about the party...if you're discreet...

70
00:11:55,383 --> 00:11:59,133
Hey...take sir to the washroom
on the first floor

71
00:11:59,217 --> 00:12:02,467
Don't let anyone bother him there
or click selfies with him

72
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:04,800
See another guy here
don't click the photo

73
00:12:04,883 --> 00:12:07,008
I swear Indira I love you...

74
00:12:07,425 --> 00:12:10,550
My mom forced me to
attend this stupid premiere

75
00:12:27,758 --> 00:12:31,425
The first floor toilet is closed
send everybody to the one upstairs

76
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:34,842
- Where did he go?
- Sent him upstairs sir

77
00:12:35,633 --> 00:12:36,383
Sir...

78
00:12:37,342 --> 00:12:38,217
You can go

79
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:45,467
The echo?
I'm in the loo here

80
00:12:45,967 --> 00:12:48,092
Yeah yeah...Dad's new film

81
00:12:49,508 --> 00:12:51,300
Don't ask! It's disgusting!

82
00:12:52,925 --> 00:12:55,550
He's done a wheelie
with the heroine in front

83
00:12:55,675 --> 00:12:58,717
Isn't he supposed to
gas up the bike?

84
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:01,092
I don't know
they're saying it's a hit

85
00:13:01,175 --> 00:13:03,425
What crap people
are watching!

86
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:17,883
But can I sacrifice
the truth for a few hairs?

87
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,258
Ok forget about all that

88
00:13:24,758 --> 00:13:28,758
We have a room in the hotel
and there's the garden also

89
00:13:39,633 --> 00:13:41,800
- Welcome doctor
- Good evening

90
00:13:41,883 --> 00:13:44,925
Why so late?
The first song is over

91
00:13:45,008 --> 00:13:46,425
Had clinic today

92
00:13:46,925 --> 00:13:48,008
How's our hero today?

93
00:13:48,092 --> 00:13:49,758
Complaining of
frequent headaches

94
00:13:49,883 --> 00:13:52,633
After drinking to celebrate?
Why's he drinking everyday now?

95
00:13:52,717 --> 00:13:54,842
He says that's the only
thing helping his headaches

96
00:13:54,925 --> 00:13:56,925
You're his supplier
shouldn't you advise him?

97
00:13:57,008 --> 00:13:58,800
When does he listen to me?

98
00:13:58,883 --> 00:14:03,425
It's my job to listen to him you're
his doctor...he'll listen to you

99
00:14:03,508 --> 00:14:05,592
Oh yes!
As if...

100
00:14:05,883 --> 00:14:07,842
Special guest!
Let her through

101
00:14:19,467 --> 00:14:20,800
Doctor, I think there's a problem

102
00:14:20,883 --> 00:14:24,217
Don't go and sit down
watch the movie from here

103
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,717
Do you have your bag?

104
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,508
- Not this one your medical bag
- What happened? Is he ok?

105
00:14:28,592 --> 00:14:30,217
I'll check and come

106
00:14:32,717 --> 00:14:34,133
- Where is he?
- Here sir

107
00:14:34,217 --> 00:14:35,050
Bloody hell!

108
00:14:35,133 --> 00:14:37,883
Is this how you guard a body?

109
00:14:37,967 --> 00:14:39,842
Come here...

110
00:14:40,342 --> 00:14:43,758
Listen...nobody...nobody
should enter inside the bathroom

111
00:14:43,842 --> 00:14:45,550
Say it's out of order
Lock it

112
00:14:45,633 --> 00:14:47,800
- Sorry sir! Not possible
- Why?

113
00:14:47,883 --> 00:14:52,633
There's only 1 toilet to a floor
and it's 5 minutes to interval

114
00:14:52,717 --> 00:14:54,258
This is ridiculous

115
00:14:54,342 --> 00:14:55,967
- Grab his legs
- What sir?

116
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:57,300
Grab his legs

117
00:14:58,175 --> 00:15:00,383
My name is Chokkalinga chettiyar
Won't you do if I don't tell my name?

118
00:15:00,467 --> 00:15:02,050
Go grab his legs

119
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:06,258
Oh heavenly goddess!
Turn him...turn him

120
00:15:08,633 --> 00:15:10,175
Come on...come on...

121
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:14,758
Set him down

122
00:15:16,592 --> 00:15:18,592
Oh God!...
Come sir

123
00:15:28,508 --> 00:15:30,133
Hey Singh...lift

124
00:15:30,425 --> 00:15:32,508
- Spit?
- Yes

125
00:15:33,383 --> 00:15:35,175
Why're you spitting
instead of lifting?

126
00:15:35,258 --> 00:15:40,842
- Me...up...lift
- Lift you? Why didn't you say so!

127
00:15:40,925 --> 00:15:45,258
Lift up
Little more...little more

128
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:48,008
Don't let go

129
00:15:51,633 --> 00:15:54,508
Let me down

130
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:00,550
- Move your head
- Yes sir

131
00:16:00,633 --> 00:16:04,133
God! Don't shake!
Can't you just say yes?

132
00:16:05,633 --> 00:16:07,050
Oh heavenly goddess!

133
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:10,633
Singh...if anyone asks

134
00:16:13,925 --> 00:16:16,508
You did this correctly
Idiot

135
00:16:26,592 --> 00:16:29,550
Chokku...wait
We're going to the hotel

136
00:16:29,633 --> 00:16:33,717
Tell your boss to come there directly
He can change there itself

137
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:34,967
What is wrong with you?

138
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:39,967
- Just 5 minutes...Toilet emergency
- Upset stomach?

139
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:41,592
Ok, leave it

140
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,508
How dare he leave
when I'm still talking?

141
00:16:44,592 --> 00:16:48,383
Come here!
Always on that blessed phone

142
00:16:48,467 --> 00:16:51,133
- Go get the car ready
- Here, have some

143
00:16:52,258 --> 00:16:53,342
Anything on 4 wheels

144
00:16:53,425 --> 00:16:55,467
As long as it doesn't
backchat like you

145
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:56,758
Such a chatterbox

146
00:16:56,842 --> 00:17:00,383
Mr.Manohar
Where is the party?

147
00:17:00,467 --> 00:17:02,550
The party?
At the Sheraton

148
00:17:03,633 --> 00:17:04,758
Take some more, my dear

149
00:17:04,842 --> 00:17:07,883
Enough popcorn, Ma
We have to eat dinner right

150
00:17:09,592 --> 00:17:12,592
So will this film also
collect 100 crores, sir?

151
00:17:12,675 --> 00:17:19,300
A - that's not for me to say
the audience will decide

152
00:17:19,383 --> 00:17:23,592
B - First day collections
...record break

153
00:17:23,675 --> 00:17:26,383
But sir, Mr. Manoranjan's guru
Mr. Maragadarisi says

154
00:17:26,508 --> 00:17:30,550
...he is so talented
that all he needs

155
00:17:30,675 --> 00:17:33,925
...is a good script
not a huge budget

156
00:17:34,008 --> 00:17:36,550
- That's his opinion
- Exactly!

157
00:17:36,633 --> 00:17:39,300
Chokku, I can't go into
the men's washroom!

158
00:17:39,342 --> 00:17:40,592
How will you manage this?

159
00:17:40,675 --> 00:17:43,925
Me?
How will 'we' manage...

160
00:17:44,633 --> 00:17:45,592
What!

161
00:17:54,675 --> 00:17:55,925
Sir...sir...

162
00:17:56,842 --> 00:17:58,800
What are you shooting there?

163
00:18:24,967 --> 00:18:25,758
Sir?

164
00:18:25,883 --> 00:18:29,633
Did Chokku give you
a bottle that he refilled?

165
00:18:29,717 --> 00:18:30,550
Yes sir

166
00:18:31,008 --> 00:18:31,883
Give it...

167
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:36,467
Not in front of the fans!
Use your head!

168
00:18:46,383 --> 00:18:48,842
Stop acting
Is it really hurting?

169
00:18:49,675 --> 00:18:50,925
Yes...I swear...

170
00:18:51,425 --> 00:18:53,633
It's not the alcohol
it's your torch light

171
00:18:53,717 --> 00:18:56,925
Your career needs the lights
...not the alcohol

172
00:18:57,008 --> 00:19:00,842
Agreed, then I need good medicines
Yours don't work

173
00:19:01,133 --> 00:19:02,967
Ok...take your shirt off

174
00:19:04,842 --> 00:19:06,383
We have time for all this?

175
00:19:06,633 --> 00:19:09,925
- What about the party?
- Aren't you here for your headache?

176
00:19:10,008 --> 00:19:10,883
Yes

177
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:13,300
Then what is this?

178
00:19:13,383 --> 00:19:16,425
Treatment...for my headache
kiss it away

179
00:19:20,592 --> 00:19:23,508
Wait...my phone
must be Dr.DS

180
00:19:28,592 --> 00:19:30,800
- Have you seen the MRI report?
- Yeah I'm bringing it

181
00:19:30,883 --> 00:19:32,300
- You're bringing it?
- Yeah

182
00:19:32,383 --> 00:19:33,633
Why...hey!

183
00:19:34,383 --> 00:19:39,425
Hello Dr. DS, M.D.
How are you, buddy?

184
00:19:39,967 --> 00:19:43,883
Hey, aren't you her senior?
M.D. Neurosurgery

185
00:19:44,092 --> 00:19:46,592
She's just a GP and
she's hassling me

186
00:19:47,258 --> 00:19:48,300
What's she saying?

187
00:19:48,383 --> 00:19:50,383
Tell me...is it wrong to drink?

188
00:19:50,467 --> 00:19:52,175
- It is wrong
- It is injurious to health

189
00:19:52,258 --> 00:19:54,592
Injurious to health
any fool knows that

190
00:19:54,675 --> 00:19:56,425
Will I die immediately?
No, right?

191
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:58,092
- It's not rat poison
- Of course not, buddy

192
00:19:58,175 --> 00:20:00,967
Right on! You're not
just an M.D...much greater

193
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:03,675
- Let me get a word in
- To say what?

194
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,758
Need to tell you something

195
00:20:04,883 --> 00:20:06,842
- Tell me at the party
- At least give her the phone

196
00:20:06,967 --> 00:20:08,717
You can see her
at the party too

197
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,800
Hey...don't...

198
00:20:09,883 --> 00:20:11,425
Why did you hang up?

199
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:13,383
I needed to talk to him!

200
00:20:13,467 --> 00:20:15,175
We need to know
the MRI result

201
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:18,092
Do you need an MRI
to see into my brain?

202
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,092
Look into my eyes

203
00:20:21,967 --> 00:20:24,300
- Move
- Why?

204
00:20:24,383 --> 00:20:25,800
This is a clinic

205
00:20:25,925 --> 00:20:28,842
That was also a clinic...where you
kissed me 5 seconds ago

206
00:20:28,925 --> 00:20:30,342
That was just a peck

207
00:20:30,425 --> 00:20:33,925
Left to you
you'd kiss me till I'm breathless

208
00:20:35,675 --> 00:20:36,592
What?

209
00:20:36,925 --> 00:20:39,675
Your wife's expecting
you at the party

210
00:20:39,758 --> 00:20:41,550
- Yes...she'll kill me
- Exactly

211
00:20:44,758 --> 00:20:47,258
My secret lover, get going

212
00:20:55,217 --> 00:20:56,967
Ok...see you at the party

213
00:20:58,217 --> 00:21:00,592
What is this
and since when?

214
00:21:24,383 --> 00:21:26,008
Ok come to the party

215
00:21:30,175 --> 00:21:34,717
"Have you fallen in love
for a single kiss?"

216
00:21:35,342 --> 00:21:37,258
You're sure
they can't see us?

217
00:21:37,342 --> 00:21:39,717
Oh God!
Are they clapping for us?

218
00:21:40,133 --> 00:21:44,967
"Fallen in love for
my eyes and voice?"

219
00:21:49,508 --> 00:21:51,383
Come...please come

220
00:21:54,467 --> 00:21:56,008
Please have dinner

221
00:24:00,883 --> 00:24:02,467
Who are you looking at?

222
00:24:03,758 --> 00:24:04,717
Who is he?

223
00:24:08,342 --> 00:24:09,550
What did he want?

224
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:13,717
I think he wants to
blackmail me for money

225
00:24:14,133 --> 00:24:15,550
With what?

226
00:24:17,675 --> 00:24:21,342
- He says I have a girl
- Girl means...

227
00:24:24,592 --> 00:24:25,967
With whom?

228
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:31,342
How would he know Yamini?

229
00:24:33,592 --> 00:24:35,967
- It's impossible
- Are you sure?

230
00:24:38,258 --> 00:24:39,508
Which of the two?

231
00:24:39,883 --> 00:24:42,175
Definitely not
He's lying

232
00:24:42,258 --> 00:24:45,383
Then inform the commissioner
and get him arrested

233
00:24:47,258 --> 00:24:48,675
You have only one son

234
00:24:48,758 --> 00:24:51,550
Then get this fellow locked up
and keep my name out of it

235
00:24:51,633 --> 00:24:53,550
- Our next film is 'Adi Sankara'
- How are you?

236
00:24:53,633 --> 00:24:57,883
Here he is! We were just
talking about you & your film

237
00:24:57,967 --> 00:25:01,050
Carry on...carry on...
that's how it grows, right?

238
00:25:01,133 --> 00:25:03,342
- Have you eaten?
- We shall...

239
00:25:03,425 --> 00:25:05,758
- So...not yet?
- When have we eaten before you?

240
00:25:05,883 --> 00:25:09,008
- Then come...let's eat
- Go ahead...I have to meet some friends

241
00:25:09,092 --> 00:25:10,883
He will fulfill his duty first

242
00:25:11,008 --> 00:25:13,717
Please...let her go
She'll be right here

243
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,175
Ganesh...let go

244
00:25:17,383 --> 00:25:24,008
Manohar! You're a man now!
Just yesterday you were a cute baby...

245
00:25:30,342 --> 00:25:32,800
- I want a copy of that
- Girish, give it to her

246
00:25:32,842 --> 00:25:33,758
Where's dad?

247
00:25:33,842 --> 00:25:37,675
Dad? Last saw him upstairs
I like your hair by the way...very nice

248
00:25:39,592 --> 00:25:41,758
- Who is this?
- Oh! Girlfriend

249
00:25:44,092 --> 00:25:48,383
You're really a big
man now! Enjoy...

250
00:25:50,717 --> 00:25:52,300
Do you really like her hair?

251
00:25:53,633 --> 00:25:55,258
I actually like short hair

252
00:25:58,842 --> 00:26:00,925
Shall I cut my hair then?

253
00:26:18,675 --> 00:26:21,008
Our doctor...drinks?

254
00:26:21,258 --> 00:26:22,675
Not usually...

255
00:26:25,383 --> 00:26:28,383
- You handle this...I'll check on them
- Where're you going?

256
00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:15,467
- Why close the curtain, uncle?
- That's what it's meant for, right?

257
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:18,842
What were you doing
behind the video screen?

258
00:27:20,008 --> 00:27:22,425
Touche? Much worse
if your mother finds out

259
00:27:22,508 --> 00:27:23,425
For whom?

260
00:27:25,175 --> 00:27:26,508
The both of you

261
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:31,758
What the hell!

262
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:39,967
Margadarisi is badmouthing your film
Have you heard?

263
00:27:41,008 --> 00:27:46,050
A - we can't discuss it
when it's sub-judice

264
00:27:47,717 --> 00:27:50,717
Sit down man
sit...sit

265
00:27:51,383 --> 00:27:56,925
B - Mr.Margadarisi has earned
Mr. Manoranjan many awards

266
00:27:57,008 --> 00:28:01,258
But what use are they?
To scrape his tongue?

267
00:28:01,342 --> 00:28:02,342
Yes, they're useless

268
00:28:02,425 --> 00:28:07,508
- But his star status...that...
- Was because of you

269
00:28:07,592 --> 00:28:09,550
Oh Lord! No...no

270
00:28:09,758 --> 00:28:12,508
I'm just a...
what do you call it?

271
00:28:12,592 --> 00:28:16,008
He is Telugu
I'll tell you...an instrument

272
00:28:16,508 --> 00:28:23,550
Yes only an instrument...like a jeweler
But my son-in-law...he is gold!

273
00:28:23,633 --> 00:28:25,258
Hello Dr...why so late?

274
00:28:25,342 --> 00:28:28,175
- I've been here awhile...I met Chokku
- Yes he did

275
00:28:28,258 --> 00:28:29,883
Mr. Manoranjan
has a headache

276
00:28:29,967 --> 00:28:31,800
I've given him a sedative
He's resting now

277
00:28:31,842 --> 00:28:33,425
- Oh no!
- Nothing to worry

278
00:28:33,842 --> 00:28:38,092
- How's your BP?
- Co-existing! Side-by-side

279
00:28:38,175 --> 00:28:40,175
We can't treat you separately

280
00:28:41,133 --> 00:28:43,675
Those sweets are for
someone else, right?

281
00:28:43,758 --> 00:28:49,758
Dr! Let her be...it's just one day
poor baby...you eat, my dear

282
00:28:49,842 --> 00:28:53,217
I'm a neurosurgeon
This is not my area of expertise

283
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:55,800
What does your lady
Dr.friend say about this?

284
00:28:55,883 --> 00:29:01,008
I don't pay attention
to all that, if I did

285
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:03,633
...I would have died of
frustration a year ago

286
00:29:03,717 --> 00:29:07,092
Forget about that...your friend has
gone to bed on an empty stomach

287
00:29:07,175 --> 00:29:09,008
That's ok
It's just one day

288
00:29:12,258 --> 00:29:14,425
Absolutely...he has to
be fresh for tomorrow

289
00:29:14,508 --> 00:29:17,800
By the way, where's Dr Arpana?
She was with you...

290
00:29:17,883 --> 00:29:20,758
She has an early day too
Gone to bed

291
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:23,300
Her also?
In the same hotel?

292
00:29:25,717 --> 00:29:27,217
Are you insane?

293
00:29:28,092 --> 00:29:29,633
She's gone home

294
00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:34,550
- Come on...I need a drink
- Of course! I'll get you a large one

295
00:29:34,925 --> 00:29:36,717
Pour...pour...

296
00:29:37,383 --> 00:29:40,717
What is it? Does she
want to marry my boss?

297
00:29:41,467 --> 00:29:48,008
Oh god! Is she pregnant?
She's a doctor, can't she have an abortion?

298
00:29:48,092 --> 00:29:52,050
Stop your vulgar blabbing
You don't know anything

299
00:29:54,217 --> 00:29:59,050
Yes but when the shit hits the fan
I have to clean it

300
00:29:59,133 --> 00:30:00,050
That's my worry

301
00:30:00,133 --> 00:30:04,175
You'll have much bigger things
to worry about

302
00:30:31,092 --> 00:30:32,550
Welcome sir

303
00:30:32,633 --> 00:30:36,342
- Cam 1...sir's close up
- Have you told her to focus on the next film

304
00:30:36,425 --> 00:30:39,425
Sir told us not to speak of the
'Adi sankara' film

305
00:30:39,467 --> 00:30:41,925
Why?
He must have been distracted

306
00:30:42,008 --> 00:30:45,633
He's in a great mood...We gave him
a coffee for his headache

307
00:30:45,717 --> 00:30:48,008
- His friend is also here
- Who?

308
00:30:48,092 --> 00:30:51,050
There...the one in
the second row with the coat

309
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:51,925
This fellow!

310
00:30:52,008 --> 00:30:54,592
He's a Malayali
gave me his card

311
00:30:54,925 --> 00:30:58,258
- I have one too
- Yes...Jacob Zachariah

312
00:30:58,508 --> 00:31:00,383
Hey Anu!
Stop drooling and begin

313
00:31:00,467 --> 00:31:04,550
Sir...we all have our favourite
scenes from your movies

314
00:31:04,633 --> 00:31:10,133
Like that, what is the most
exciting moment in your life?

315
00:31:12,883 --> 00:31:13,800
This

316
00:31:18,175 --> 00:31:21,175
But, what is so special
in this moment?

317
00:31:24,008 --> 00:31:25,883
What are you
thinking so deeply, sir?

318
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:28,508
This applause itself is special, right?

319
00:31:33,758 --> 00:31:38,133
But you've heard this applause
so many times...

320
00:31:38,217 --> 00:31:39,925
Perhaps but...

321
00:31:41,050 --> 00:31:47,550
An artiste is always unsure
whether he will be applauded again

322
00:31:47,967 --> 00:31:55,550
So...I have that insecurity too

323
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:00,967
Cam - 3 cover the audience

324
00:32:02,008 --> 00:32:04,842
See...your longing is satisfied

325
00:32:05,175 --> 00:32:10,717
Let's rewind a bit
when Manoranjan is 24 yrs old

326
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:16,175
You've made 5 classic films
all with Mr. Margadarisi

327
00:32:16,258 --> 00:32:22,133
But your 6th film...mega budget
made you a huge star

328
00:32:23,425 --> 00:32:29,258
Produced by your now father-in-law
That was also when you got married

329
00:32:29,342 --> 00:32:34,342
Tell me honestly,
was that young Mano...

330
00:32:34,425 --> 00:32:40,842
...entranced by cinema
or Miss Varalakshmi?

331
00:32:43,467 --> 00:32:49,092
She knew that you loved
cinema over all else

332
00:32:49,717 --> 00:32:53,925
But your betrayal
broke her heart

333
00:32:54,883 --> 00:32:59,842
Your father-in-law gave her
a lot of money to leave you alone

334
00:33:01,092 --> 00:33:06,883
But she didn't touch a penny of it
even though she desperately needed it

335
00:33:17,175 --> 00:33:20,758
She didn't take the money
didn't have an abortion either

336
00:33:20,842 --> 00:33:26,592
If she had, I wouldn't have
my daughter Manonmani

337
00:33:32,758 --> 00:33:34,050
Yamini named her

338
00:33:36,717 --> 00:33:38,633
We have another daughter too

339
00:33:44,967 --> 00:33:46,758
You are a great man

340
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:54,550
Everyone lied to me

341
00:33:55,675 --> 00:33:57,258
Even Chokku

342
00:33:57,342 --> 00:34:03,675
Let that go! They did
what they thought was best for you

343
00:34:06,383 --> 00:34:15,050
You know, my career was in
Poonachandra Rao's hands

344
00:34:17,342 --> 00:34:19,967
I was a kid
with big dreams

345
00:34:21,383 --> 00:34:25,133
In that conflict...my life

346
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:32,925
We are Catholics you know
but when I told my mother

347
00:34:38,008 --> 00:34:39,967
She did not forbid it

348
00:34:41,842 --> 00:34:45,633
I've known 2 great
ladies in this world

349
00:34:45,717 --> 00:34:50,592
My mother and Yamini
But both are gone now

350
00:34:56,050 --> 00:34:59,050
Yamini...she's no more now

351
00:35:00,592 --> 00:35:01,800
She's gone

352
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:14,883
I'm here for my wife's sake now

353
00:35:15,925 --> 00:35:23,217
It was her last wish that Manonmani
meet her biological father

354
00:35:25,425 --> 00:35:27,675
I'm not asking
for anything else

355
00:35:31,008 --> 00:35:38,092
I have never refused her
anything that's why...

356
00:35:56,217 --> 00:36:00,925
- Does my daughter...sorry your daughter
- They're both the same sir

357
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:07,467
Does she know this?

358
00:36:07,633 --> 00:36:12,175
She does...But we told her a bit late
After her degree

359
00:36:15,133 --> 00:36:17,092
Time flies by, right Mano?

360
00:36:30,675 --> 00:36:32,675
Would you like
to see Mano's photo?

361
00:36:42,758 --> 00:36:44,633
When she was in school

362
00:36:51,008 --> 00:36:52,883
That's during her degree

363
00:36:55,258 --> 00:36:57,383
Is this something a sane
person would do?

364
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:01,883
Don't forget your next
film is 'Adi Sankara'

365
00:37:02,217 --> 00:37:05,508
The press will have a field day

366
00:37:05,925 --> 00:37:08,133
One photo of you as a saint

367
00:37:08,217 --> 00:37:11,092
and the next one of you
as a 'Married Bachelor'

368
00:37:11,175 --> 00:37:13,883
Manoranjan's Love Tales

369
00:37:14,050 --> 00:37:18,758
The film will stop halfway and
then the producer will come to me

370
00:37:18,883 --> 00:37:21,008
Where are you
walking off to?

371
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:25,467
- Return the advance of that film
- Which? Why?

372
00:37:25,842 --> 00:37:27,217
I don't have
the time to do it

373
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:30,592
Say's who? I've given
them a block of 90 days

374
00:37:30,717 --> 00:37:35,383
- I have some other work at that time
- All 90 days? What work is that?

375
00:37:35,592 --> 00:37:38,717
- Another film
- With whom?

376
00:37:39,092 --> 00:37:41,425
My guru, Mr. Margadarisi

377
00:37:41,967 --> 00:37:43,925
Which fellow is producing it?

378
00:37:46,175 --> 00:37:47,217
I am

379
00:37:49,467 --> 00:37:50,383
Ok

380
00:37:51,342 --> 00:37:54,967
Have you told your
father-in-law?

381
00:37:55,092 --> 00:37:56,092
And then?

382
00:37:56,425 --> 00:37:58,467
Do you work for me?
Or for him?

383
00:37:58,550 --> 00:38:01,258
- That's not what I asked
- Answer my question

384
00:38:02,217 --> 00:38:03,508
I work for you

385
00:38:04,675 --> 00:38:08,342
Then get an appointment
with Mr. Margadarisi asap

386
00:38:08,425 --> 00:38:11,175
But at his convenience
Can you or can't you?

387
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:14,258
Of course...but if you
asked our lawyer

388
00:38:14,842 --> 00:38:17,342
I just asked
that's all

389
00:38:24,633 --> 00:38:26,008
Here he is...

390
00:38:26,842 --> 00:38:30,883
Get out of the way
Open the gate...he's here

391
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:34,217
Close the gate

392
00:38:36,967 --> 00:38:38,467
I can't let you
in just like that

393
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:41,508
Why does a gathering of journalists
turn into a shouting match?

394
00:38:41,592 --> 00:38:44,217
I being the PRO man,
knew just 20 minutes ago

395
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:46,425
You'll know as soon as the meeting is over

396
00:38:46,508 --> 00:38:48,717
How can your Mano sir leave
without answering us?

397
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,925
Didn't I promise you
an interview afterwards?

398
00:38:51,008 --> 00:38:53,425
So stop shouting!
Do I look like a fool?

399
00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:56,008
Why ask us that? Don't you
have a mirror at home?

400
00:38:56,133 --> 00:38:59,217
Aishu darling! So funny! Move
your hand before it gets crushed

401
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:02,050
Lakshmana, are they doing
a film together after 14 years?

402
00:39:02,133 --> 00:39:05,217
Why? I've already made
so many with you

403
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:08,508
Reached you to
the absolute peak

404
00:39:08,592 --> 00:39:12,467
That's true sir
but I want one film now

405
00:39:13,383 --> 00:39:18,175
And whatever you want
you must get...at any price

406
00:39:18,258 --> 00:39:20,425
But all your money can't
buy this Margadarisi

407
00:39:20,508 --> 00:39:23,592
Don't say that, sir
just one film...

408
00:39:23,675 --> 00:39:26,467
so people don't forget us
don't forget me sir

409
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:28,467
Nobody will forget you, my boy!

410
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:30,883
You have your father-in-law
to remind them

411
00:39:37,217 --> 00:39:42,175
Sir, I'm no king! I'm an actor
You made me one

412
00:39:42,258 --> 00:39:46,133
I don't know how to
make films for big stars

413
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:47,800
I must have a story

414
00:39:47,883 --> 00:39:51,925
And a story is not a platform ticket
available at your whim and fancy

415
00:39:52,050 --> 00:39:54,425
I must find it convincing

416
00:39:54,592 --> 00:39:57,258
I don't have one like that
Do you?

417
00:39:57,550 --> 00:39:58,133
No sir

418
00:39:58,217 --> 00:40:01,967
So simple! It's impossible
Please go

419
00:40:04,842 --> 00:40:07,550
- Sir, Dr. Arpana is here
- Who?

420
00:40:07,967 --> 00:40:11,300
I asked her to join us, sir
with your permission, may I...?

421
00:40:17,675 --> 00:40:19,550
No need!
Did I ask for it?

422
00:40:19,633 --> 00:40:23,050
Ok sir
take it back...go down

423
00:40:28,342 --> 00:40:31,550
- Shall I return when you're done?
- No...no

424
00:40:31,633 --> 00:40:34,717
I'm done talking
Done

425
00:40:35,633 --> 00:40:39,258
Please don't say that sir
Be kind sir...please

426
00:40:39,342 --> 00:40:42,175
Kindness won't cut it here

427
00:40:42,342 --> 00:40:47,967
You need a story big enough to fit
the halo around your head

428
00:40:48,050 --> 00:40:49,467
We can catch
hold of that sir

429
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:53,633
Are you going fishing?
Ok go, catch one...let's see

430
00:40:55,175 --> 00:40:58,092
Sir...give me 1 minute
to tell you my story please

431
00:40:58,175 --> 00:40:59,967
1 minute?

432
00:41:06,133 --> 00:41:08,050
An arrogant man like me

433
00:41:10,217 --> 00:41:13,925
Who thinks tomorrow
is far in the future

434
00:41:14,925 --> 00:41:19,175
His world is one day
shattered by two things

435
00:41:20,008 --> 00:41:25,925
Suddenly he has no time to say
'I love you', 'Thank you', 'I'm sorry'

436
00:41:27,758 --> 00:41:29,675
Doctors say he has
a brain tumor

437
00:41:29,758 --> 00:41:31,383
What?
Cancer?

438
00:41:32,842 --> 00:41:34,008
Get out of here

439
00:41:34,425 --> 00:41:36,925
I thought you'd
say something new

440
00:41:37,258 --> 00:41:39,758
Tamil cinema has
done it to death

441
00:41:39,842 --> 00:41:41,258
That was my first film

442
00:41:41,342 --> 00:41:43,592
You yourself have done several

443
00:41:43,675 --> 00:41:46,717
Every story needs
a rhyme and reason

444
00:41:47,133 --> 00:41:51,508
Sir this...this is the reason

445
00:41:51,717 --> 00:41:52,717
What?

446
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,342
We have to find the story now

447
00:41:56,092 --> 00:41:57,383
I don't understand!

448
00:41:57,467 --> 00:41:59,800
I can't explain
the technicalities of it

449
00:42:00,258 --> 00:42:04,133
That's why I've brought
the doctor along

450
00:42:05,467 --> 00:42:07,300
Don't fool around like this!

451
00:42:08,342 --> 00:42:09,383
Is this true?

452
00:42:11,717 --> 00:42:14,758
You gave me a great time
in the industry

453
00:42:15,883 --> 00:42:17,967
But now the time is running out

454
00:42:19,467 --> 00:42:21,467
I want my last film
to be with you sir

455
00:42:22,258 --> 00:42:24,092
Sir sir...please don't refuse sir

456
00:42:24,175 --> 00:42:25,633
I'm not refusing!

457
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:27,675
What is this?

458
00:42:27,842 --> 00:42:29,967
Doctor is this true?

459
00:42:31,883 --> 00:42:36,133
What abomination is this?
I'm 83

460
00:42:36,675 --> 00:42:39,592
He's just a boy
How is this possible?

461
00:42:41,467 --> 00:42:43,217
What Dr...what is this?

462
00:42:44,758 --> 00:42:45,883
Oh Lord!

463
00:42:46,008 --> 00:42:48,258
It's manageable if it was
in the frontal lobe

464
00:42:48,717 --> 00:42:50,008
It's at the back

465
00:42:50,092 --> 00:42:51,925
Can't you operate?

466
00:42:52,633 --> 00:42:54,342
We could...

467
00:42:56,425 --> 00:42:57,300
But...

468
00:42:58,133 --> 00:42:59,258
In his case...

469
00:43:01,508 --> 00:43:03,092
He has some complications

470
00:43:05,633 --> 00:43:08,967
- She's asking for the bathroom
- Over there

471
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:58,508
Come...come here

472
00:43:59,967 --> 00:44:01,008
Sit down

473
00:44:01,092 --> 00:44:04,258
- Sir, I'll sit there
- No, sit down here

474
00:44:04,342 --> 00:44:05,467
Sorry sir

475
00:44:05,717 --> 00:44:09,050
I'm a bit...I'm usually
stronger than this

476
00:44:09,133 --> 00:44:11,717
Me too, my dear

477
00:44:12,008 --> 00:44:16,258
But in Mano's case
I love this rascal

478
00:44:16,633 --> 00:44:17,967
Me too, sir

479
00:44:18,550 --> 00:44:21,217
Who doesn't love this boy?

480
00:44:21,675 --> 00:44:25,175
Everybody loves him, everybody

481
00:44:26,508 --> 00:44:27,342
Okay

482
00:44:27,550 --> 00:44:31,133
I'll make your film
as you like, happy?

483
00:44:31,258 --> 00:44:33,467
How much time
will you give me?

484
00:44:33,925 --> 00:44:36,633
Don't have much
of it to give, sir

485
00:44:36,925 --> 00:44:44,008
My God! My God!
I shouldn't have asked

486
00:44:50,258 --> 00:44:55,133
Okay, tell me what kind of film
you want to make?

487
00:44:55,758 --> 00:44:56,842
I'm ready

488
00:44:57,175 --> 00:44:58,133
Okay, sir

489
00:44:59,008 --> 00:45:00,842
No one else knows about this, sir

490
00:45:00,925 --> 00:45:01,800
Alright

491
00:45:02,633 --> 00:45:04,342
Let's keep this to ourselves

492
00:45:04,425 --> 00:45:08,883
I want the audience
to exit the theatre laughing

493
00:45:09,008 --> 00:45:10,342
Let's make a comedy film, sir

494
00:45:10,425 --> 00:45:13,592
Go home laughing?
Laughing?

495
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:18,008
Okay, my boy
we'll make a comedy

496
00:45:54,550 --> 00:45:55,883
Uttama Villain!

497
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:04,717
Who will finance it when both
the partners are fighting in court?

498
00:46:07,967 --> 00:46:12,008
We've withdrawn the case with mutual
understanding and submitted in writing

499
00:46:14,633 --> 00:46:17,842
Why didn't you write
this house over to him?

500
00:46:18,217 --> 00:46:22,050
You ask me for everything
food, drink, bath water, your scotch

501
00:46:22,133 --> 00:46:24,633
Didn't you think to
ask me about this?

502
00:46:24,925 --> 00:46:26,550
Why should I?

503
00:46:26,633 --> 00:46:27,883
Why should you...

504
00:46:29,633 --> 00:46:32,717
Not needed,
Mr. Manoranjan

505
00:46:33,550 --> 00:46:35,800
I'm not needed here anymore

506
00:46:35,883 --> 00:46:39,925
Now you have the great
Mr. Margadarisi to advice you

507
00:46:41,133 --> 00:46:43,217
It's best that I fade out

508
00:46:43,592 --> 00:46:45,967
Leaving me alone, Daddy?

509
00:46:46,342 --> 00:46:48,550
Nobody has to leave
anybody and go!

510
00:46:50,508 --> 00:46:55,550
Family, my foot! Family doesn't learn
of your decisions on the TV

511
00:46:55,633 --> 00:46:58,300
That's your audience...
Not me

512
00:46:58,383 --> 00:47:02,467
Daddy, admit me in the hospital
or take me home

513
00:47:02,592 --> 00:47:03,717
I want to come too, Ma

514
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:08,050
What, is this a joke?
Selfish to the core

515
00:47:08,133 --> 00:47:09,300
Just like your father

516
00:47:09,383 --> 00:47:12,425
Look at him sitting there
Don't you have anything to say?

517
00:47:12,967 --> 00:47:14,258
There's plenty

518
00:47:14,342 --> 00:47:16,717
But if you react like this
to a small thing

519
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:18,258
Calm down
I'll tell you later

520
00:47:18,592 --> 00:47:22,467
Oh! So you have bigger secrets?
Come daddy, let's go home

521
00:47:26,383 --> 00:47:29,342
Don't sit like a statue
say something

522
00:47:30,050 --> 00:47:32,008
I will when your BP comes down

523
00:47:32,092 --> 00:47:34,925
That will come down
when there's good news

524
00:47:37,967 --> 00:47:39,342
Okay, I won't tell you

525
00:47:39,758 --> 00:47:42,925
Daddy, I'm going to pack, let's go

526
00:47:45,050 --> 00:47:46,758
Atleast say bye

527
00:47:48,717 --> 00:47:50,592
See?
This is it

528
00:47:58,967 --> 00:48:02,550
Hey Arumugam,
have you forgotten?

529
00:48:02,633 --> 00:48:07,175
Who you are?
A good for nothing orphan

530
00:48:07,258 --> 00:48:11,633
I picked you up off the streets
and married you to a goddess

531
00:48:11,717 --> 00:48:13,592
Is this your gratitude?

532
00:48:13,883 --> 00:48:17,800
Varalakshmi is my life
My world

533
00:48:18,675 --> 00:48:23,050
If anything happens to her
you'll die by my hand

534
00:48:24,050 --> 00:48:26,258
Oh! You'll murder me?

535
00:48:26,342 --> 00:48:27,800
If necessary

536
00:48:28,758 --> 00:48:30,592
This Poornachandra Rao
does not lie

537
00:48:34,675 --> 00:48:38,092
Well, if your threat is real

538
00:48:38,717 --> 00:48:42,800
A - it would be the biggest favor
you could ever do me

539
00:48:42,883 --> 00:48:47,133
B - You'll go to jail and
I won't be there to see it

540
00:48:47,508 --> 00:48:48,675
I'm leaving now

541
00:48:50,467 --> 00:48:55,800
Wait! This house is mine, right?
Or does your daughter, Varalakshmi

542
00:48:57,217 --> 00:48:58,633
Thank you
I will leave

543
00:49:10,050 --> 00:49:12,800
- You will regret this
- I will not

544
00:49:13,050 --> 00:49:15,092
- Let's see
- Let's see

545
00:49:15,425 --> 00:49:16,758
Namaste

546
00:49:22,967 --> 00:49:24,467
- Chokku
- Sir?

547
00:49:24,550 --> 00:49:25,758
Namaste

548
00:49:51,550 --> 00:49:57,008
Yes sir...yes sir...definitely sir
If we place the Akela here

549
00:50:00,592 --> 00:50:02,967
Don't do it
he'll get worked up

550
00:50:05,092 --> 00:50:08,883
Sir please, must I
wear this crown?

551
00:50:09,008 --> 00:50:10,133
It's very heavy, sir

552
00:50:10,217 --> 00:50:11,758
Yes sir, it is a bit heavy

553
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:18,842
As it is actors are big headed
Imagine them playing royalty

554
00:50:19,925 --> 00:50:21,800
Anyway, listen to the story first

555
00:50:21,883 --> 00:50:22,550
Okay, sir

556
00:50:22,633 --> 00:50:24,300
Long long ago...

557
00:50:24,467 --> 00:50:25,967
I mean...

558
00:50:31,217 --> 00:50:31,925
Oh no!

559
00:50:32,008 --> 00:50:35,717
Don't be afraid
this is what folklore is

560
00:50:36,425 --> 00:50:42,092
Characters are in black and white
but we shoot in color

561
00:50:42,175 --> 00:50:45,758
Hero's name is 'Uttaman'
the film is called 'Uttama Villain'

562
00:50:46,550 --> 00:50:48,467
But 'Villain' is
an English word!

563
00:50:48,592 --> 00:50:52,467
Won't you lose the Tamil Nadu
tax benefit because of an English title?

564
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:55,925
Oh wow! She seems
to be a smart girl

565
00:50:56,008 --> 00:50:57,175
A very smart girl

566
00:50:57,258 --> 00:50:58,842
Who said 'Villain'
isn't a Tamil word?

567
00:50:58,925 --> 00:51:00,675
One who fights with
a 'Mallu' is a 'Mallan'

568
00:51:00,758 --> 00:51:02,592
and one who fights
with a 'Villu' is a 'Villain'

569
00:51:02,675 --> 00:51:04,883
Arjun is a 'Villain' & Sivan
is the greatest of them all

570
00:51:04,967 --> 00:51:07,342
- Hey...hey...hey...cut cut cut
- The 'Kurinji' has a song that-

571
00:51:11,925 --> 00:51:15,925
Uttaman is a street actor in
the kingdom of 'Muthuvala Nadu'

572
00:51:16,008 --> 00:51:22,675
He's playing Arjuna in the scene where
he asks for the bow from Lord Siva

573
00:51:24,050 --> 00:51:31,717
We're using a fusion of
Villupattu & Kerala's 'Theyyam'

574
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:36,092
The song is the narrator
the dance brings it alive

575
00:51:36,217 --> 00:51:38,467
Are you ready, sir?

576
00:51:39,050 --> 00:51:43,342
This is the great Subbu...
Subbu Arumugam

577
00:51:43,425 --> 00:51:49,592
He is a legend
The authority on 'Villupattu'

578
00:51:51,883 --> 00:51:53,800
Let's hear the opening

579
00:52:08,842 --> 00:52:17,008
"Bless us, O Goddess
As we begin our song in verse"

580
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:25,508
"Bless us as we sing with music
and instrument in rhythm..."

581
00:52:30,342 --> 00:52:35,217
"...enacted in the great theatre forms
of the Pandian and Cheran kingdoms"

582
00:52:35,300 --> 00:52:40,467
"...to tell the tale of Arjuna's plea
for Lord Shiva's weapon"

583
00:52:40,550 --> 00:52:43,467
"...in a Grand performance"

584
00:52:43,550 --> 00:52:48,258
"Betwixt the sky above and the earth
below stands the Great Archer"

585
00:52:48,383 --> 00:52:50,925
"...and his story will now be
told by this painted actor"

586
00:52:51,008 --> 00:52:58,925
"Please narrate to
the world, O Wise One!"

587
00:53:08,258 --> 00:53:14,842
"I have beheld a Miracle
akin to a truthful politician!"

588
00:53:14,925 --> 00:53:21,425
"With great tenacity I have achieved
mastery over many battle skills"

589
00:53:21,508 --> 00:53:24,925
"Is it the fruit of my
penance to lord Shiva"

590
00:53:25,008 --> 00:53:28,300
"...that the world trembles
at the sound of Arjuna's name?"

591
00:53:28,383 --> 00:53:31,592
"The Lord's Weapon
is now Arjuna's"

592
00:53:31,675 --> 00:53:35,008
"Eternally Victorious!
The world's greatest Artiste"

593
00:53:35,092 --> 00:53:38,008
"Lord Shiva!
I bow to you"

594
00:53:38,092 --> 00:53:41,300
"The bounty of Shiva's
blessing is all- pervasive!"

595
00:53:41,383 --> 00:53:44,550
"O Shiva! Beloved of your Consort
O Cosmic Dancer!"

596
00:53:44,675 --> 00:53:47,925
"The Lord, who dances
unpaid in the temple"

597
00:53:48,008 --> 00:53:50,967
"King Arjuna, who performs
on his own strength"

598
00:53:51,050 --> 00:53:54,508
"Why do you dance on one leg?
Are you giddy dancing on both?"

599
00:53:54,592 --> 00:53:56,550
"Ganga on your head
Drum in your hand..."

600
00:53:56,633 --> 00:53:58,967
"Woman by your side
O merciful mother!"

601
00:53:59,050 --> 00:54:03,092
Hey! This is a snake!
You'll die if it bites you, get away

602
00:54:04,550 --> 00:54:06,925
A snake?
Just wait and see

603
00:54:07,050 --> 00:54:10,092
No no...don't do that
It's a snake...a snake!

604
00:54:11,883 --> 00:54:14,425
It's on the stick...

605
00:54:14,508 --> 00:54:16,508
Snake! Snake! Snake!

606
00:54:16,633 --> 00:54:20,050
Oh no! My snake...my snake...

607
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:38,383
Climb the tree everyone
There's danger on the ground

608
00:54:39,258 --> 00:54:42,467
Ow! Who is it?
Who pinched me? Who bit me?

609
00:54:48,425 --> 00:54:49,383
Where did it go?

610
00:54:49,467 --> 00:54:52,175
Oh no!
4 people are dead

611
00:54:52,258 --> 00:54:55,050
Our man is in agony!
Suck the poison out!

612
00:54:55,133 --> 00:54:56,258
So what if he's one of us

613
00:54:56,342 --> 00:54:57,800
I can't put my mouth there

614
00:54:58,883 --> 00:55:00,550
- The 5th one is dead too
- Oh no!

615
00:55:00,675 --> 00:55:01,800
It's my snake or what!

616
00:55:01,883 --> 00:55:04,217
You were a snake charmer
without knowing that?

617
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:09,550
Oh no! Don't kill it!
Not my snake...no not my snake

618
00:55:09,633 --> 00:55:11,550
Five people are dead!

619
00:55:45,842 --> 00:55:48,800
Water...water...!

620
00:55:48,883 --> 00:55:51,592
- You want water now, useless fellow?
- I didn't say anything

621
00:55:51,717 --> 00:55:56,633
Then was it the voice of God?
Put that rice in the orphan corpse's mouth

622
00:55:58,467 --> 00:55:59,758
Ghost! Ghost!

623
00:55:59,842 --> 00:56:02,883
Oh no...! Oh Lord...!
Ghost! Ghost!

624
00:56:02,967 --> 00:56:07,633
"Ghost...ghost
ghost...ghost"

625
00:56:08,008 --> 00:56:12,633
"The voice of Uttaman was
not understood by the people"

626
00:56:13,092 --> 00:56:18,008
"Oh! They screamed those
with ghosts within them"

627
00:56:18,258 --> 00:56:23,342
"Ghost! Ghost!
Ghost! Ghost!"

628
00:56:23,425 --> 00:56:28,050
"The villagers ran their heels
slapping the nape of their necks"

629
00:56:28,175 --> 00:56:33,175
"Those with dancing ghosts within
Accused Uttaman the dancer as ghost"

630
00:56:33,258 --> 00:56:38,425
"How did Uttaman rise
magically from the pyre?"

631
00:56:38,508 --> 00:56:45,467
"Having bitten 4 the snake on
the 5th bite ran out of poison"

632
00:56:45,592 --> 00:56:49,133
"Uttaman survived the teeth
of the venom less snake"

633
00:56:49,217 --> 00:56:53,550
"A rational mind would
have understood"

634
00:56:53,842 --> 00:56:58,758
"Alas! None of that
kind lived in that village"

635
00:56:59,175 --> 00:57:03,008
"Ghost! Ghost! Ghost!"

636
00:57:12,008 --> 00:57:17,133
"The village tried to
appease Uttaman's soul"

637
00:57:17,217 --> 00:57:21,758
"...by stuffing themselves
with a feast in his honor"

638
00:57:28,175 --> 00:57:36,508
"Relentless and tireless they
ate through the storm and rain"

639
00:57:37,758 --> 00:57:44,925
"Cursing his fate of attending
his own funeral lunch"

640
00:57:45,008 --> 00:57:52,258
"Uttaman was the last to be fed"

641
00:57:52,342 --> 00:57:56,592
Worthless when he was alive
but look at his funeral feast

642
00:57:57,550 --> 00:58:00,633
May his actor's soul
rest in peace

643
00:58:00,717 --> 00:58:04,508
I would die every day
for such a feast!

644
00:58:04,592 --> 00:58:06,758
Some more please
May my soul rest in peace

645
00:58:06,842 --> 00:58:08,717
Huh!
Is it you?

646
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:11,592
Please don't shout
let me finish eating

647
00:58:12,092 --> 00:58:13,633
Ghost! Ghost!

648
00:58:13,717 --> 00:58:15,883
- No! No!
- Ghost! Ghost!

649
00:58:15,967 --> 00:58:18,342
No one panic! Someone
check for both his feet

650
00:58:18,425 --> 00:58:21,800
- But he's sitting cross legged
- Nonsense! Can you see his feet?

651
00:58:21,883 --> 00:58:22,967
I see them!

652
00:58:23,050 --> 00:58:24,717
Ghost has stuffed my mouth

653
00:58:24,842 --> 00:58:27,175
Sir! I have two
Here's one

654
00:58:27,258 --> 00:58:30,050
Oh languishing spirit!
What do you want?

655
00:58:30,133 --> 00:58:33,758
2 vadai, 2 sweet pancakes
a little sambar...give me

656
00:58:33,842 --> 00:58:35,467
Give it
It's asking, isn't it?

657
00:58:35,550 --> 00:58:36,758
Yes...please give me

658
00:58:36,842 --> 00:58:37,758
Give!

659
00:58:42,175 --> 00:58:43,467
Is the ghost dead?

660
00:58:44,633 --> 00:58:45,925
Is it dead?

661
00:58:46,008 --> 00:58:47,633
That's how one becomes a ghost!

662
00:58:47,967 --> 00:58:50,967
"Uttaman strapped tightly
to the funeral plank"

663
00:58:51,050 --> 00:58:55,383
"They walked again to
the cremation ground"

664
00:59:00,967 --> 00:59:02,258
Water

665
00:59:03,633 --> 00:59:04,842
Water

666
00:59:05,675 --> 00:59:11,758
'Uttaman's thirst for life was
quenched by the rising river'

667
00:59:19,467 --> 00:59:21,092
'The water entered the town'

668
00:59:21,175 --> 00:59:24,008
'The bamboo plank
became Uttaman's float'

669
00:59:24,092 --> 00:59:26,383
'While others drowned'

670
00:59:26,467 --> 00:59:32,425
'The river gargled and spat out
Uttaman granting him immortality'

671
00:59:32,550 --> 00:59:35,717
'The dam breaching
mud coloured deluge'

672
00:59:48,175 --> 00:59:52,717
Water as far as the eye can see
but not a drop to drink

673
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:56,175
Oh Lord! Give me
some water!

674
00:59:58,508 --> 01:00:00,383
That's enough
that's enough

675
01:00:20,217 --> 01:00:24,633
Amazing! I truly am a great man
I'm in heaven!

676
01:00:28,050 --> 01:00:32,050
This nightingale is great too
it has also entered heaven

677
01:00:34,758 --> 01:00:36,633
Bird droppings?

678
01:00:41,717 --> 01:00:48,883
Bird droppings mean this must not
cannot...is not...heaven!

679
01:00:50,467 --> 01:00:54,050
Ah! The traipsing deer

680
01:00:59,258 --> 01:01:00,758
The dancing peacock

681
01:01:02,925 --> 01:01:04,675
The grazing rabbit

682
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:08,925
Lord! Please send me
something to eat

683
01:01:12,925 --> 01:01:14,550
Aah! Crocodile!

684
01:01:14,675 --> 01:01:19,050
I asked for something to eat and
you send something to eat me!

685
01:01:19,133 --> 01:01:24,467
Lord! Release your discus
and kill the beast!

686
01:01:26,258 --> 01:01:27,675
Oh no! Oh no!

687
01:01:32,383 --> 01:01:33,592
Oh no! Oh no!

688
01:01:53,175 --> 01:01:58,175
But wait...it pulls me too
Lord! I don't want to die

689
01:01:58,258 --> 01:02:02,175
I won't die! I won't die

690
01:02:04,175 --> 01:02:06,258
- He didn't die of the snakebite
- He didn't die

691
01:02:06,342 --> 01:02:08,217
- He didn't die of the blow
- He didn't die

692
01:02:08,300 --> 01:02:10,592
Know why? Because he chanted
the names of Lord Narayana

693
01:02:10,675 --> 01:02:13,633
The name of your Lord
makes him immortal? Atrocious!

694
01:02:13,717 --> 01:02:15,675
- Immortal meaning?
- One who has conquered death

695
01:02:15,758 --> 01:02:18,633
Hah! No one has ever
survived this waterfall

696
01:02:18,717 --> 01:02:21,925
He would have reached
Kailash by now

697
01:02:22,008 --> 01:02:24,967
- Why not Vaikuntha?
- Vaikuntha or Kailash

698
01:02:25,050 --> 01:02:27,092
We'll decide when
the corpse washes up

699
01:02:27,175 --> 01:02:28,717
Aah! A miracle
He is alive!

700
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:29,967
Where? Where? Where?

701
01:02:30,050 --> 01:02:32,675
- Look! Uttaman is alive
- Praise the Lord

702
01:02:32,883 --> 01:02:36,383
- Aah! - Aah!
- He is immortal

703
01:02:36,633 --> 01:02:38,758
Hail, Immortal one!

704
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:52,258
I'm okay with
the last scene

705
01:02:52,550 --> 01:02:55,425
- You, DP?
- Okay by me, sir

706
01:02:55,508 --> 01:02:56,508
Sure?

707
01:02:58,133 --> 01:03:02,050
I know you won't
be satisfied till the end

708
01:03:07,133 --> 01:03:09,050
- I'll be back in a minute
- Go ahead

709
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:25,592
Yeah...yeah, come in

710
01:03:34,675 --> 01:03:38,217
Hey...come in
one minute

711
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:44,675
Come

712
01:03:45,425 --> 01:03:47,133
Please dear, come

713
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:10,550
Come in, sit down

714
01:04:10,675 --> 01:04:14,717
No...one minute...
my car is in front of this van

715
01:04:14,842 --> 01:04:18,050
To move the van
I have to move my...

716
01:04:55,508 --> 01:04:56,717
You look exactly like...

717
01:04:56,800 --> 01:05:00,675
No! Fortunately I look
nothing like you

718
01:05:01,467 --> 01:05:03,133
I'm exactly like my mother

719
01:05:04,925 --> 01:05:06,717
That's what I was
going to say

720
01:05:23,217 --> 01:05:25,300
I didn't know your
mother was pregnant

721
01:05:26,508 --> 01:05:27,383
I know

722
01:05:28,425 --> 01:05:32,092
My mother has told me
this story many times

723
01:05:32,383 --> 01:05:34,383
- She told you?
- Yes

724
01:05:35,383 --> 01:05:36,675
But I didn't believe it

725
01:05:38,717 --> 01:05:41,550
But that's irrelevant now

726
01:05:42,883 --> 01:05:43,883
My father

727
01:05:52,425 --> 01:05:54,842
I'm here for
his sake only

728
01:06:02,717 --> 01:06:04,467
Can you do
me a favour?

729
01:06:04,925 --> 01:06:06,133
Only if possible

730
01:06:20,925 --> 01:06:24,425
You have to lie to my father
that I was polite to you

731
01:06:26,425 --> 01:06:27,592
That's not a lie

732
01:06:32,967 --> 01:06:34,925
Jacob Zachariah is my father

733
01:06:35,342 --> 01:06:38,050
It's the truth and it's
what makes me happy so

734
01:06:40,050 --> 01:06:43,300
Happy...that's okay
But the truth?

735
01:06:43,467 --> 01:06:45,050
It's my truth

736
01:06:47,175 --> 01:06:51,092
The one I believe
You are the lie here

737
01:06:54,717 --> 01:06:57,717
He's my hero
you are

738
01:07:04,550 --> 01:07:07,592
Well, that's in your story

739
01:07:08,967 --> 01:07:11,675
In mine, I'm trying
to be the hero

740
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:17,133
Can you do me
this favour or not?

741
01:07:51,008 --> 01:07:53,008
- Sir!
- No Parthi, wait outside

742
01:07:53,092 --> 01:07:54,675
Inform only Chokku.
No one else

743
01:07:54,758 --> 01:07:55,883
Get the car ready

744
01:07:58,008 --> 01:08:01,258
We were just talking
he just fell down

745
01:08:07,758 --> 01:08:10,133
We shall...we shall
just give me a minute

746
01:08:18,342 --> 01:08:20,050
Would you help me?

747
01:08:24,008 --> 01:08:25,383
Hold both hands

748
01:08:26,258 --> 01:08:29,467
We have to lift him onto
the sofa...grab his legs

749
01:08:42,175 --> 01:08:43,633
Is it life threatening?

750
01:08:46,467 --> 01:08:49,758
Actually this is a stage
4 brain tumor

751
01:08:50,592 --> 01:08:54,133
Doctors say
it is incurable

752
01:08:54,592 --> 01:08:57,550
To tell the truth
he is sinking

753
01:09:06,592 --> 01:09:10,258
Have you informed
his wife and Mr. Rao?

754
01:09:10,342 --> 01:09:13,175
No sir...they're
not together now

755
01:09:13,258 --> 01:09:17,883
What? Not in the house?
Or in his life? Is he alone then?

756
01:09:18,008 --> 01:09:20,967
They were angry at both
of you working together

757
01:09:21,092 --> 01:09:22,967
Mano didn't want
me to tell you

758
01:09:23,050 --> 01:09:28,050
Whatever he said, how can they
leave him at a time like this?

759
01:09:28,175 --> 01:09:30,800
He hasn't told them
about the tumour

760
01:09:32,050 --> 01:09:33,925
- Not even his wife?
- No

761
01:09:34,008 --> 01:09:37,217
I've been a faithful
dog for 27 years

762
01:09:37,633 --> 01:09:39,508
He didn't tell me either

763
01:09:40,175 --> 01:09:44,300
Only because I know some Malayalam
I could understand their conversation

764
01:09:44,383 --> 01:09:47,050
Or I'd have also
read it in the papers

765
01:09:47,550 --> 01:09:50,508
But you know now
why are you angry?

766
01:09:50,592 --> 01:09:56,425
Not angry, I'm hurt because
he chose not to tell me

767
01:09:57,550 --> 01:10:00,675
And I know why
he made that choice

768
01:10:00,842 --> 01:10:01,717
Why?

769
01:10:02,217 --> 01:10:04,467
That...is between us

770
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:08,508
What's the matter with him?

771
01:10:11,383 --> 01:10:13,550
Feeling tired, buddy?

772
01:10:15,133 --> 01:10:16,800
Sir! Please come in

773
01:10:17,050 --> 01:10:18,258
Stay...stay

774
01:10:18,383 --> 01:10:22,258
I've canceled the shoot
Rest a bit, don't get up

775
01:10:22,342 --> 01:10:26,092
No sir, we're on a tight schedule
I'm good to go, sir

776
01:10:26,592 --> 01:10:32,050
You're good to go
but I'm old, I need rest, okay?

777
01:10:32,133 --> 01:10:36,300
What can I say to that, sir?
You're the youngest old man I know

778
01:10:36,383 --> 01:10:40,508
Correct, I'm the youngest old man
You're the oldest young man

779
01:10:40,592 --> 01:10:42,508
"While this story pauses here"

780
01:10:42,592 --> 01:10:47,842
"We are about to tell you
a story from another place"

781
01:10:48,967 --> 01:10:54,425
"The King Sadayavarman
ruled Muthuvala Nadu"

782
01:10:54,550 --> 01:11:00,092
"He ruled justly his
spectre glowing"

783
01:11:00,175 --> 01:11:06,050
"All was ruined due to avarice
and treachery by his relative"

784
01:11:06,175 --> 01:11:12,383
Long live the King
Sadayavarman

785
01:11:22,175 --> 01:11:27,008
Here she comes
a painting that walks

786
01:11:27,133 --> 01:11:34,675
The light of the dynasty her
Highness Princess Karpagavalli

787
01:11:57,425 --> 01:12:00,592
Long live princess

788
01:12:08,675 --> 01:12:14,008
The King's wife's brother
Decided to kill his brother-in-law

789
01:12:14,092 --> 01:12:18,550
...by loosening some bricks
of the royal balcony

790
01:12:18,633 --> 01:12:20,258
Welcome King!

791
01:12:21,300 --> 01:12:24,050
Long live the King!
Long live the King!

792
01:12:24,133 --> 01:12:25,842
Greetings to the King of Kings

793
01:12:25,925 --> 01:12:29,258
Behold the torrent
of your subjects!

794
01:12:30,175 --> 01:12:31,633
Here...here

795
01:12:32,508 --> 01:12:34,217
Please lean over and see

796
01:12:43,592 --> 01:12:45,425
Hold on tight

797
01:12:45,550 --> 01:12:48,175
Let me go...let me go

798
01:12:49,592 --> 01:12:54,508
Alas! What is this horror!
Oh Mother Earth, accept me too!

799
01:12:54,633 --> 01:12:55,550
Don't let go

800
01:12:55,675 --> 01:12:57,967
No, my King, there is none else
to safeguard the kingdom

801
01:12:58,050 --> 01:13:00,508
- Besides, my hands are paining
- That's also correct

802
01:13:01,092 --> 01:13:04,717
Alas! Duty calls

803
01:13:05,050 --> 01:13:08,758
Majesty!
Your Majesty

804
01:13:19,217 --> 01:13:24,842
Alas! How can I bear this?
How can I bear this?

805
01:13:26,008 --> 01:13:29,467
A month after putting
the King below the earth

806
01:13:29,550 --> 01:13:33,258
Mutharasan sent his sister
to keep royal company

807
01:13:52,883 --> 01:13:55,633
Go, my little birdie

808
01:14:08,467 --> 01:14:13,217
So! She seeks the aid of
our neighboring King!

809
01:14:13,300 --> 01:14:16,342
You! Have you caged
the Princess's tiger?

810
01:14:16,425 --> 01:14:18,508
It is done, your Majesty
See there

811
01:14:25,383 --> 01:14:27,717
Who has caged my child?

812
01:14:27,800 --> 01:14:29,717
- It was I
- Why?

813
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:34,633
That child has 4 legs
I can give you a 2 legged child

814
01:14:34,717 --> 01:14:37,925
That neighboring King
Senguttuvan is not fit for it

815
01:14:40,717 --> 01:14:44,050
- Your Majesty!
- Get out! She is enough for today

816
01:14:44,133 --> 01:14:50,008
The Villain tried to rape his
own sister's daughter.

817
01:14:50,092 --> 01:14:54,717
The Princess in a mad rage
chewed his ear and spat it out

818
01:14:58,717 --> 01:15:01,842
Oh no! She's bitten
my ear off and spat it out

819
01:15:01,925 --> 01:15:04,508
Alas! You didn't
hear my warning

820
01:15:04,592 --> 01:15:07,383
I did! I do! Even after
she bit my ear off

821
01:15:07,467 --> 01:15:08,925
...I can still hear

822
01:15:09,008 --> 01:15:10,300
First conceal your ear

823
01:15:10,633 --> 01:15:12,342
No! Not that!

824
01:15:12,425 --> 01:15:15,133
It should not become known
that the King doesn't have a ear

825
01:15:15,258 --> 01:15:17,967
It's a deficit in necessary
Kingly qualities

826
01:15:18,050 --> 01:15:20,050
Yes! We can cover
it with a turban

827
01:15:20,467 --> 01:15:25,008
No eye should see your ear and
no ear should hear this news

828
01:15:25,092 --> 01:15:26,467
What are you blabbering?

829
01:15:26,550 --> 01:15:30,467
We can change your hairstyle
to a bun on that side

830
01:15:30,550 --> 01:15:34,508
First get some medicine and then
kill the demon who bit my ear

831
01:15:34,758 --> 01:15:35,925
No

832
01:15:36,758 --> 01:15:40,508
My King! Continuous deaths are
not good for the monarchy

833
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:45,342
First let us imprison her and
let the madness subside

834
01:15:45,467 --> 01:15:48,342
So that she can bite
my other ear off too?

835
01:15:48,425 --> 01:15:52,508
No, your Majesty,
so we can have a wedding...

836
01:15:52,592 --> 01:15:53,675
...to your Majesty

837
01:15:53,800 --> 01:15:56,467
Don't they say
marriage cures madness?

838
01:15:56,550 --> 01:15:58,008
That is an old saying

839
01:15:58,092 --> 01:16:02,383
We want not old
but everything new

840
01:16:02,467 --> 01:16:04,550
...that is our aim

841
01:16:06,008 --> 01:16:07,842
Imprison her!

842
01:16:08,883 --> 01:16:14,175
Ah! I can hear! Minister,
we must stitch my ear and...

843
01:16:14,717 --> 01:16:17,467
- Oh no! Where is my ear?
- Here, it was here

844
01:16:17,550 --> 01:16:18,550
Where?

845
01:16:22,217 --> 01:16:25,133
Oh no! It had a gold earring too

846
01:16:25,300 --> 01:16:26,300
Keep quiet!

847
01:16:26,383 --> 01:16:28,842
Correct, what does it matter
when the ear is gone?

848
01:16:28,925 --> 01:16:31,217
- It was a good ear
- But we have the right ear

849
01:16:31,342 --> 01:16:33,508
It can never be
equal to the left

850
01:16:34,092 --> 01:16:36,758
Big...ministers you are!

851
01:16:45,717 --> 01:16:49,050
The dictator's reign
brought peace to none

852
01:16:49,175 --> 01:16:52,425
Including the guilty Mutharasan

853
01:16:54,258 --> 01:17:00,717
The superstitious Mutharasan
was warned of dark times

854
01:17:06,842 --> 01:17:11,092
'May you have a horrible death'

855
01:17:11,467 --> 01:17:14,633
His death was confirmed
by the sacred texts and...

856
01:17:14,717 --> 01:17:17,300
...shook him to the core

857
01:17:17,383 --> 01:17:21,092
As he sat terrified
word came of Uttaman

858
01:17:21,175 --> 01:17:23,258
...who'd cheated
death five times

859
01:17:23,383 --> 01:17:30,800
Mutharasan commanded
he be brought to court

860
01:17:30,883 --> 01:17:33,467
Go and get him

861
01:17:47,800 --> 01:17:52,467
- Hey! Are really immortal?
- Nothing of the sort

862
01:17:52,592 --> 01:17:56,217
- Can't you be stoned to death?
- I most definitely can

863
01:17:56,300 --> 01:17:58,675
Lets try and see

864
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:03,092
10 stones for a coin!
10 stones for a coin!

865
01:18:03,175 --> 01:18:04,425
Take it

866
01:18:04,508 --> 01:18:06,925
Brother! What kind
of business is this?

867
01:18:09,717 --> 01:18:14,467
"Stones for sale
Stones for sale"

868
01:18:15,342 --> 01:18:17,925
"Stones for sale"

869
01:18:18,258 --> 01:18:21,883
He who has cheated death!

870
01:18:23,300 --> 01:18:26,425
You have immortality?
Give me some

871
01:18:26,508 --> 01:18:30,425
Oh God, woman!
Would I keep it to myself?

872
01:19:17,967 --> 01:19:22,592
Your Highness, someone
has started a rumour...

873
01:19:22,675 --> 01:19:24,633
...that this fellow
is immortal

874
01:19:26,300 --> 01:19:28,258
- What is your name?
- Some Uttama

875
01:19:28,383 --> 01:19:30,967
- Some Uttama...
- No! Just Uttama

876
01:19:31,133 --> 01:19:33,425
- He has two names?
- Uttaman!

877
01:19:34,133 --> 01:19:37,133
Do you know why you
have been summoned?

878
01:19:40,050 --> 01:19:42,800
Don't you think that you
have been bound in chains...

879
01:19:42,883 --> 01:19:45,550
...and brought here
for the sheer fun of it?

880
01:19:47,925 --> 01:19:51,008
What is this?
I expected a witty response...

881
01:19:51,092 --> 01:19:53,800
...but he just stands there
This is the Immortal One?

882
01:19:53,883 --> 01:19:55,383
Not at all
That is what...

883
01:19:55,467 --> 01:19:56,633
I'm dead

884
01:19:56,717 --> 01:19:58,842
No, Your Highness
he is died

885
01:19:59,342 --> 01:20:00,842
But that is what
he too says

886
01:20:00,925 --> 01:20:05,217
- No, your Highness, he denies it
- Just answer the question

887
01:20:05,300 --> 01:20:07,008
No, your Highness

888
01:20:07,092 --> 01:20:10,592
It was this snake charmer
who hit him on my order

889
01:20:10,675 --> 01:20:13,300
Yes, I hit him and he died

890
01:20:13,383 --> 01:20:15,675
Before that he
died of a snakebite

891
01:20:15,758 --> 01:20:18,717
Wait! He was also
bitten by a snake?

892
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:19,592
Yes

893
01:20:20,467 --> 01:20:22,925
Then why did you spare
the snake and hit him?

894
01:20:23,008 --> 01:20:25,092
- The dead snake was mine
- Then this fellow?

895
01:20:25,175 --> 01:20:26,425
He also dead

896
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:27,675
Majesty...!

897
01:20:28,258 --> 01:20:31,383
- First was the snake bite...
- No, this is the Princess's bite

898
01:20:31,467 --> 01:20:36,300
Your Highness! This is
meant for the right ear

899
01:20:36,383 --> 01:20:39,925
Should not political
secrets be kept secrets?

900
01:20:40,008 --> 01:20:44,175
- They must! What did you advice?
- Let us test him & verify!

901
01:20:44,842 --> 01:20:46,717
Good idea
Go, sit down

902
01:20:49,258 --> 01:20:51,050
I have an idea

903
01:20:55,550 --> 01:20:58,883
These two accepted
their crime, correct?

904
01:20:59,008 --> 01:21:00,175
Yes your Highness

905
01:21:00,258 --> 01:21:03,467
Therefore, the murders
will be killed!

906
01:21:03,550 --> 01:21:06,092
- Your Highness
- Your Highness

907
01:21:06,175 --> 01:21:10,842
May the people be told that
my weapon of justice before the law

908
01:21:12,217 --> 01:21:14,342
- Play now you fools
- Fools play

909
01:21:21,967 --> 01:21:23,925
Stop...stop I say

910
01:21:39,300 --> 01:21:44,758
Hold still or you'll lose your
life instead of your hair

911
01:22:00,925 --> 01:22:04,758
Honorable ministers,
is this mustache sufficient?

912
01:22:04,842 --> 01:22:06,175
Enough...enough

913
01:22:06,258 --> 01:22:10,258
Sudalaimuthu, do you see
how we have fallen?

914
01:22:10,592 --> 01:22:15,258
Kaakapusunadar, we erred in
allowing the king to test him

915
01:22:15,883 --> 01:22:19,092
This fellow has bound hand & foot now
Why don't we test him ourselves?

916
01:22:19,217 --> 01:22:21,217
- How?
- Like this!

917
01:23:05,800 --> 01:23:09,758
Immortal! He's Immortal

918
01:23:12,050 --> 01:23:14,258
Bring the crane
back around

919
01:23:17,425 --> 01:23:19,633
This shot was good,
shall we go?

920
01:23:21,842 --> 01:23:24,383
Give him a towel first!

921
01:23:24,758 --> 01:23:27,883
Fantastic my boy wonderful

922
01:23:28,008 --> 01:23:31,967
The next shot we can
take on the front of original river

923
01:23:32,050 --> 01:23:35,008
What's that in your nose?
Looks like a rose petal

924
01:23:35,258 --> 01:23:37,800
- Looks like blood, sir
- What! Blood?

925
01:23:37,883 --> 01:23:39,675
- It's bleeding
- Will you shut up?

926
01:23:41,300 --> 01:23:42,925
Sir, please come with me

927
01:23:43,592 --> 01:23:44,550
Please, go that side

928
01:23:44,675 --> 01:23:45,592
Please, come

929
01:23:45,717 --> 01:23:48,258
What is it?
What is happening?

930
01:23:48,342 --> 01:23:51,467
Nothing to fuss
about it sir, this is normal

931
01:23:51,550 --> 01:23:55,342
- How can this be normal?
- It's normal for this illness

932
01:23:55,425 --> 01:23:57,050
But I find it abnormal

933
01:23:57,175 --> 01:23:58,758
Lets go to the doctor

934
01:23:58,842 --> 01:24:01,342
No no need for that
I called the doctor for here

935
01:24:01,425 --> 01:24:04,967
- So you won't listen to me?
- Sir, they will be here any minute

936
01:24:05,050 --> 01:24:07,258
What do you want
me to do now?

937
01:24:08,050 --> 01:24:10,675
Call for a short break

938
01:24:10,758 --> 01:24:13,967
I'll clean up
& will be right back

939
01:25:22,933 --> 01:25:25,224
Hey you! Do you know this chant?

940
01:25:25,449 --> 01:25:26,824
I swear I don't

941
01:25:28,058 --> 01:25:30,225
If he doesn't even
know the immortality spell...

942
01:25:30,308 --> 01:25:32,056
...how could he be immortal?

943
01:25:32,238 --> 01:25:35,863
Your Majesty!
An idea, that is...

944
01:25:41,006 --> 01:25:43,839
Why don't we test him
to prove it?

945
01:25:45,355 --> 01:25:46,397
O holy Ones...

946
01:25:46,582 --> 01:25:47,582
Yes, majesty

947
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:04,392
Don't you grease this
sword once in a while?

948
01:26:04,408 --> 01:26:06,200
It never comes out
when I need it

949
01:26:08,533 --> 01:26:09,992
Your Highness...pearls...

950
01:26:10,742 --> 01:26:11,533
There...

951
01:26:13,367 --> 01:26:14,200
Your Highness?

952
01:26:19,033 --> 01:26:20,283
Some more pearls

953
01:26:26,617 --> 01:26:27,617
Get out

954
01:26:27,700 --> 01:26:28,950
Your Highness!

955
01:26:42,742 --> 01:26:45,075
This kingdom of pearls
is aptly named

956
01:26:46,617 --> 01:26:48,492
There...one more pearl

957
01:27:00,700 --> 01:27:02,700
What is wrong with them?

958
01:27:02,783 --> 01:27:05,575
Uh...it is proven that
they are not immortal

959
01:27:06,825 --> 01:27:09,283
It's a marvel he
hasn't lost his head

960
01:27:09,367 --> 01:27:10,825
Could he be immortal?

961
01:27:10,908 --> 01:27:12,658
Your Highness, this is
just blind luck!

962
01:27:12,742 --> 01:27:14,742
Blind or deaf
luck is luck

963
01:27:15,283 --> 01:27:16,617
- Hold this
- Uttama

964
01:27:17,658 --> 01:27:19,575
What use immortality for
a commoner like you?

965
01:27:19,658 --> 01:27:20,950
Give it to your King

966
01:27:21,033 --> 01:27:22,617
Your Majesty, how can
we beg this fellow?

967
01:27:22,700 --> 01:27:23,992
You...scum...

968
01:27:24,075 --> 01:27:24,617
Sir

969
01:27:24,700 --> 01:27:26,533
- Get back
- That's right

970
01:27:26,992 --> 01:27:28,950
I will prove that
you're not immortal

971
01:27:29,075 --> 01:27:33,533
An artiste lives, dies
and is born everyday

972
01:27:33,617 --> 01:27:35,825
people might have mistaken
that for immortality

973
01:27:35,908 --> 01:27:37,742
Me and immortal?

974
01:27:38,242 --> 01:27:42,158
But these unimaginable
riches, this palace...

975
01:27:45,450 --> 01:27:47,325
A beautiful statue...
who is it?

976
01:27:48,575 --> 01:27:50,575
Princess Karpagavalli's

977
01:27:51,950 --> 01:27:53,450
You have such
a beautiful daughter?

978
01:27:53,533 --> 01:27:55,242
Rubbish!
She is my betrothed

979
01:27:55,325 --> 01:27:57,950
Oh! When is the wedding?

980
01:28:02,367 --> 01:28:04,700
I'm waiting for
the madness to settle

981
01:28:06,783 --> 01:28:08,242
Doesn't appear so

982
01:28:11,033 --> 01:28:13,283
Your Highness, may I
say something?

983
01:28:14,492 --> 01:28:15,617
In your ear...

984
01:28:18,242 --> 01:28:22,742
Keeping a pet crow...
listening to these ministers...

985
01:28:22,825 --> 01:28:26,992
if you cease these
the madness will surely settle

986
01:28:27,825 --> 01:28:28,867
Whose madness?

987
01:28:30,408 --> 01:28:31,700
Hey! You...

988
01:28:32,450 --> 01:28:34,408
I will chop you
up into crows food!

989
01:28:34,492 --> 01:28:36,658
- Your Highness, permit me!
- No no!

990
01:28:36,783 --> 01:28:41,158
It's just eaten 4 whole ears
Don't overfeed it!

991
01:28:46,325 --> 01:28:47,408
Give me your ear

992
01:28:47,492 --> 01:28:50,575
- My ear? Your Highness!
- I need to tell you a secret

993
01:28:51,033 --> 01:28:54,575
- Your Highness, me?
- Everybody come and listen

994
01:29:05,242 --> 01:29:07,783
But first we must safeguard
ourselves, come!

995
01:29:10,117 --> 01:29:12,283
- You stay there
- As you command

996
01:29:17,658 --> 01:29:18,742
Begin!

997
01:29:23,117 --> 01:29:24,492
Hurry up!

998
01:31:11,617 --> 01:31:12,200
Rat!

999
01:31:15,158 --> 01:31:15,742
Tiger!

1000
01:31:45,575 --> 01:31:49,492
A charging rat and
a cringing tiger

1001
01:31:50,325 --> 01:31:52,908
This truly is
a mad kingdom

1002
01:31:53,617 --> 01:31:55,950
What are you?
A rat...

1003
01:31:57,117 --> 01:31:58,200
or a tiger?

1004
01:31:59,658 --> 01:32:01,367
I am scared

1005
01:32:06,617 --> 01:32:09,492
I feel I've seen
you somewhere

1006
01:32:11,950 --> 01:32:13,825
That snake bite
was an omen

1007
01:32:13,908 --> 01:32:16,367
Now every animal
& human wants a bite

1008
01:32:16,617 --> 01:32:20,242
Oh! Are you the one
the snake bit?

1009
01:32:20,325 --> 01:32:22,575
So you think you
can bite me too?

1010
01:32:31,533 --> 01:32:33,200
Please don't mistake me

1011
01:32:35,158 --> 01:32:37,617
Are you also mad?

1012
01:32:40,700 --> 01:32:42,408
You also...meaning?

1013
01:32:42,492 --> 01:32:47,408
I'll explain, I just saw a very
big headed King downstairs

1014
01:32:48,992 --> 01:32:52,200
He has one pet crow
and 2 ministers

1015
01:32:52,283 --> 01:32:54,283
Are you an enemy
of the king's?

1016
01:32:56,242 --> 01:32:58,617
- He is my enemy
- That is good

1017
01:32:58,700 --> 01:33:02,200
An enemy who does not even
have the courage of this rat

1018
01:33:02,367 --> 01:33:04,283
How did he set
my tiger free?

1019
01:33:04,367 --> 01:33:08,658
He went in the cage
and let the tiger out

1020
01:33:08,742 --> 01:33:10,075
I knew it

1021
01:33:11,533 --> 01:33:16,617
Is that statue outside
any relation to you?

1022
01:33:16,700 --> 01:33:18,450
It's identical but
for the hair

1023
01:33:18,533 --> 01:33:21,283
- It is I
- I knew it

1024
01:33:23,367 --> 01:33:25,492
Run away with me!
What manner of place is this

1025
01:33:25,575 --> 01:33:28,075
They imprison a woman
and free a tiger

1026
01:33:28,368 --> 01:33:30,242
Do not fret, Uttama!

1027
01:33:30,617 --> 01:33:31,992
Why fear when I am here

1028
01:33:32,075 --> 01:33:36,033
You are here but I'm
afraid I will cease to be

1029
01:33:37,825 --> 01:33:40,033
What need of
laughter now?

1030
01:33:40,117 --> 01:33:42,283
I can hear the
tiger nearby

1031
01:33:42,630 --> 01:33:45,046
Can't you smell
his stink?

1032
01:33:46,492 --> 01:33:49,242
Somewhere here

1033
01:33:59,408 --> 01:34:01,325
Ah! It slapped me!
Oh it was you

1034
01:34:01,408 --> 01:34:02,700
What is your weight?

1035
01:34:02,825 --> 01:34:06,158
I'm light but the palace
food has added to it

1036
01:34:06,242 --> 01:34:07,283
Why do you ask?

1037
01:34:07,367 --> 01:34:10,742
Your weight is
breaking my waist

1038
01:34:12,158 --> 01:34:15,158
Forgive me! I dangled on you
like a jackfruit on a creeper

1039
01:34:15,283 --> 01:34:17,992
That's alright
atleast you got down

1040
01:34:18,075 --> 01:34:19,242
Thank you for that

1041
01:34:23,908 --> 01:34:26,617
It obeys you
Is it your pet?

1042
01:34:27,617 --> 01:34:28,825
What's his name?

1043
01:34:30,908 --> 01:34:33,200
Oh! His name is
also Uttaman?

1044
01:34:37,033 --> 01:34:39,950
The tiger's name
is Puliyeru

1045
01:34:40,033 --> 01:34:42,367
This man's name
is Uttaman

1046
01:34:42,950 --> 01:34:44,367
How do you
know my name?

1047
01:34:44,492 --> 01:34:46,200
The whole
kingdom speaks

1048
01:34:47,658 --> 01:34:48,867
...of you

1049
01:34:49,992 --> 01:34:51,450
Saying what?

1050
01:34:51,533 --> 01:34:54,992
That you are the king's
newest boot licker

1051
01:34:55,533 --> 01:35:03,575
That you are immortal and
will teach the spell to the king

1052
01:35:03,908 --> 01:35:07,408
Nothing like that! I don't know
even one blessed spell

1053
01:35:07,492 --> 01:35:11,950
Then he will surely
take your head

1054
01:35:12,408 --> 01:35:16,992
I know that now
but not how to escape

1055
01:35:17,492 --> 01:35:22,700
It's the skill of an actor
act your way out of it

1056
01:35:22,742 --> 01:35:24,658
Of course
act as what?

1057
01:35:24,742 --> 01:35:26,450
One who has
conquered death

1058
01:35:26,533 --> 01:35:28,325
That is what I'm not

1059
01:35:28,367 --> 01:35:31,242
and even if I do
how'd I convince them?

1060
01:35:31,742 --> 01:35:33,825
It is possible

1061
01:35:37,950 --> 01:35:39,783
You mustn't bite

1062
01:35:41,033 --> 01:35:43,617
Do you have the courage
to save your country?

1063
01:35:43,700 --> 01:35:45,950
What use is courage?
What can a mere actor do?

1064
01:35:46,033 --> 01:35:48,533
Plenty.
But will you?

1065
01:35:49,492 --> 01:35:54,158
I will but I fear your tiger
will devour me in your absence

1066
01:35:54,242 --> 01:35:58,658
Swear you will save your country
and the tiger will become a cat

1067
01:36:01,408 --> 01:36:02,492
Alright...I swear

1068
01:36:02,617 --> 01:36:07,242
Henceforth my tiger
is your pussycat

1069
01:36:11,492 --> 01:36:13,742
Spread your legs
like this

1070
01:36:13,825 --> 01:36:15,908
- But these are hands
- Your legs

1071
01:36:16,367 --> 01:36:17,283
A little more

1072
01:36:18,700 --> 01:36:20,033
Close your eyes

1073
01:36:21,158 --> 01:36:23,492
Ah! Your eyes

1074
01:36:23,575 --> 01:36:25,617
Uttama, obey!

1075
01:36:42,575 --> 01:36:44,742
Open your eyes
without fear

1076
01:36:47,367 --> 01:36:50,242
The tiger's gone
thank the lord

1077
01:36:51,283 --> 01:36:53,325
It's between my legs

1078
01:36:53,742 --> 01:36:56,492
- Just stand there
- I am

1079
01:36:56,575 --> 01:36:58,367
I'm talking
to my tiger

1080
01:36:58,450 --> 01:36:59,617
Oh! Please carry on

1081
01:36:59,700 --> 01:37:02,283
Rise, my dear
rise

1082
01:37:02,367 --> 01:37:04,283
Aah! Oh god
oh god oh god

1083
01:37:04,367 --> 01:37:05,825
I'm dead...I'm dead
I'm dead...

1084
01:37:05,908 --> 01:37:07,700
Is this how the
Immortal One speaks?

1085
01:37:07,783 --> 01:37:10,075
Our savior's voice
must not tremble

1086
01:37:10,158 --> 01:37:10,700
Must not

1087
01:37:10,783 --> 01:37:13,575
Now hold the neck

1088
01:37:14,325 --> 01:37:17,325
Ah! The tiger's neck

1089
01:37:20,075 --> 01:37:22,575
He will turn as
you pull him

1090
01:37:24,158 --> 01:37:24,950
Pull!

1091
01:37:26,825 --> 01:37:30,367
Oh god...oh god
the tiger has turned

1092
01:37:30,408 --> 01:37:34,367
Do you wish to
walk like a horse?

1093
01:37:34,908 --> 01:37:37,992
Nudge his flanks
with your heels

1094
01:37:38,075 --> 01:37:42,283
- Can't reach
- The tiger's flanks!

1095
01:37:42,367 --> 01:37:44,575
Courage is the spell
of immortality...courage

1096
01:37:44,700 --> 01:37:45,825
Courage...

1097
01:37:45,908 --> 01:37:49,033
Nudge him with
your heels

1098
01:37:50,033 --> 01:37:51,408
Courage!

1099
01:38:01,325 --> 01:38:03,742
Oh...father!

1100
01:38:03,825 --> 01:38:07,158
Not your father!
Call upon the Lord

1101
01:38:07,242 --> 01:38:09,492
- Courage
- Immortal One!

1102
01:38:10,700 --> 01:38:14,867
- He truly is immortal, isn't he?
- Yes Sir...yes

1103
01:38:15,992 --> 01:38:21,158
Look at that tuft on his head!
Swaying in its majestic beauty

1104
01:38:21,242 --> 01:38:24,575
- He truly is immortal
- Yes yes

1105
01:38:37,033 --> 01:38:39,658
The tiger was a
pussycat in my hands

1106
01:38:39,742 --> 01:38:41,658
That's the magic of cinema

1107
01:38:41,742 --> 01:38:43,200
Right, Mano?

1108
01:38:48,117 --> 01:38:49,700
He's asleep

1109
01:38:49,783 --> 01:38:51,575
Don't disturb him
Let's leave

1110
01:38:53,950 --> 01:38:57,492
- Sir, about the DI
- We'll check it on the table

1111
01:39:04,075 --> 01:39:06,325
He gets tired
very easily now

1112
01:39:06,408 --> 01:39:08,158
Yes and we've
started chemo too, sir

1113
01:39:10,908 --> 01:39:13,825
- This is luck?
- Yes sir, in a way

1114
01:39:13,908 --> 01:39:16,450
Some patients have a lot of pain
He has none

1115
01:39:17,075 --> 01:39:19,117
Some have memory loss

1116
01:39:19,783 --> 01:39:21,908
- They don't know their family
- Oh God!

1117
01:39:21,992 --> 01:39:23,908
But he's fine with
dialogue & all, sir

1118
01:39:24,783 --> 01:39:29,450
Even so, people
near him can see

1119
01:39:29,533 --> 01:39:32,992
It's wrong that he still
hasn't told his family

1120
01:39:33,450 --> 01:39:38,200
I don't have any
of this ego nonsense

1121
01:39:38,283 --> 01:39:39,242
I'll do it myself

1122
01:39:39,325 --> 01:39:43,492
Go that godforsaken
Raoji's house...

1123
01:39:43,575 --> 01:39:44,742
...and fall at his feet

1124
01:39:44,825 --> 01:39:46,283
What is this, sir?

1125
01:39:47,325 --> 01:39:51,617
Go inside! You need to be
there when he awakens

1126
01:40:08,326 --> 01:40:09,368
What is it?

1127
01:40:10,750 --> 01:40:12,283
- What?
- Nothing

1128
01:40:13,908 --> 01:40:16,950
Come here! I'll get
a crick in my neck

1129
01:40:17,700 --> 01:40:21,700
I've been faithful to you
all these years

1130
01:40:24,908 --> 01:40:27,658
Even my lies were
for your own good

1131
01:40:27,742 --> 01:40:28,950
Okay so what?

1132
01:40:29,742 --> 01:40:32,908
That is...
I'm leaving

1133
01:40:34,200 --> 01:40:39,117
But this letter...
it belongs to you

1134
01:40:40,408 --> 01:40:42,200
I kept it hidden
all these years

1135
01:40:42,700 --> 01:40:44,992
...even that was for
your own good

1136
01:40:45,075 --> 01:40:46,325
What letter is that?

1137
01:40:47,176 --> 01:40:51,842
25 years back...
Yamini wrote you

1138
01:40:55,100 --> 01:40:57,184
It was a mistake...
my mistake

1139
01:40:57,370 --> 01:40:58,662
Mistake?

1140
01:40:58,706 --> 01:41:00,998
Ok...it was a crime
a sin

1141
01:41:03,450 --> 01:41:05,242
Don't look at
me like that

1142
01:41:05,783 --> 01:41:07,158
I'm your Chokku

1143
01:41:07,867 --> 01:41:13,283
We've no blood ties but you've
been my brother all these years

1144
01:41:15,050 --> 01:41:17,592
- Let me go sir, I'll leave
- Shut up!

1145
01:41:17,675 --> 01:41:20,258
Leaving...do you know
what it really means?

1146
01:41:20,342 --> 01:41:21,925
Stop shouting at me

1147
01:41:22,342 --> 01:41:25,925
Even an ant has pride
don't you think I have too?

1148
01:41:26,008 --> 01:41:28,592
I have it too
sit down

1149
01:41:29,925 --> 01:41:30,883
Sit down!

1150
01:41:42,967 --> 01:41:45,675
- Read the letter
- Is this my punishment?

1151
01:41:48,008 --> 01:41:52,925
Penance! Yours and mine
Read it

1152
01:41:54,883 --> 01:41:55,758
Read it

1153
01:41:55,925 --> 01:41:56,800
I can go...

1154
01:42:03,925 --> 01:42:07,633
May 5th, 19...

1155
01:42:20,008 --> 01:42:23,508
Even though we know
each other's thoughts

1156
01:42:23,592 --> 01:42:30,967
...love can make us deaf & mute
Therefore I write this letter with love

1157
01:42:31,883 --> 01:42:35,717
I trust your vows but
my heart is anxious

1158
01:42:36,425 --> 01:42:40,258
I got my pregnancy
test result...Positive

1159
01:42:40,342 --> 01:42:45,467
I can wait for you
but our baby can't

1160
01:42:45,550 --> 01:42:48,258
I will not have
another abortion

1161
01:42:48,550 --> 01:42:51,967
If you fear this will hurt
your 'Dream Lover' image

1162
01:42:52,050 --> 01:42:57,008
...or destroy your career as
Mr.Poornachandra Rao has threatened

1163
01:42:57,092 --> 01:43:01,008
...I will definitely not
be the reason for it

1164
01:43:01,092 --> 01:43:05,633
I leave for Kerala tomorrow
at least call me before that

1165
01:43:05,967 --> 01:43:12,717
If I don't hear from you in a week
I'll understand your silence

1166
01:43:13,508 --> 01:43:18,508
As I wrote, your father-in-law
to be & your manager

1167
01:43:19,675 --> 01:43:20,633
Read

1168
01:43:22,508 --> 01:43:24,133
...Chokku came here

1169
01:43:26,258 --> 01:43:30,675
They first threatened
& then tried to buy me off

1170
01:43:31,508 --> 01:43:34,133
They said you
knew of this

1171
01:43:36,967 --> 01:43:40,383
If you do know, my
waiting is stupidity

1172
01:43:43,217 --> 01:43:46,550
I had to throw
them out rudely

1173
01:43:46,633 --> 01:43:49,550
If possible, please try
to see us soon

1174
01:43:49,633 --> 01:43:54,300
As we decided, our son
will be called Manoharan

1175
01:43:55,967 --> 01:43:58,592
Our daughter...
Manonmani

1176
01:43:59,508 --> 01:44:02,717
If you are not with us...

1177
01:44:02,800 --> 01:44:06,383
...don't I need another
to lovingly call Mano?

1178
01:44:07,008 --> 01:44:12,092
With faith that we
shall be together, Yamini

1179
01:44:22,633 --> 01:44:25,133
Didn't you give
her my letter?

1180
01:44:34,467 --> 01:44:38,550
If I did, your father-in-law
threatened suicide

1181
01:44:43,050 --> 01:44:45,342
What should
I have done?

1182
01:44:46,467 --> 01:44:50,592
No punishment will suffice
Whatever...I will accept it

1183
01:44:57,633 --> 01:45:00,425
Please don't look
at me like that

1184
01:45:01,133 --> 01:45:03,425
Dismiss me
I'll leave

1185
01:45:07,217 --> 01:45:11,633
I can't fire you now

1186
01:45:13,175 --> 01:45:16,508
You have work for
another 9 months, hmm?

1187
01:45:18,592 --> 01:45:23,342
If you're done earlier...
someone else will inform you

1188
01:45:24,008 --> 01:45:28,050
But you'll be paid
for the 9 months

1189
01:45:30,425 --> 01:45:31,258
Stop crying

1190
01:45:33,258 --> 01:45:38,217
It doesn't suit you
Get to work

1191
01:45:38,300 --> 01:45:41,967
Arpana...Dr come

1192
01:46:22,633 --> 01:46:23,758
Good morning, sir

1193
01:46:25,717 --> 01:46:26,592
Enter

1194
01:46:38,467 --> 01:46:41,717
- Madam...he's arrived
- Yes, a while ago

1195
01:46:41,800 --> 01:46:47,425
Not our sir...hero sir has come
along with that director

1196
01:46:48,050 --> 01:46:54,842
I must confess, I've
abused you a lot...sorry

1197
01:46:55,342 --> 01:46:56,800
So have I

1198
01:46:56,883 --> 01:47:01,842
Naturally!
How is your BP?

1199
01:47:02,842 --> 01:47:08,550
Better than my daughter's BP
What did you want to discuss?

1200
01:47:10,133 --> 01:47:12,592
Mano...tell him

1201
01:47:15,467 --> 01:47:17,050
What is it?

1202
01:47:17,633 --> 01:47:18,758
That...

1203
01:47:21,050 --> 01:47:24,758
I won't be around
much longer

1204
01:47:26,217 --> 01:47:27,092
Alive

1205
01:47:36,383 --> 01:47:38,425
- Can't take this more!
- Give me the ball

1206
01:47:38,508 --> 01:47:43,300
No! Give it to me
You've had it now

1207
01:47:43,592 --> 01:47:45,883
Please granny it
won't happen again

1208
01:47:45,967 --> 01:47:49,300
You'll feel your
grandfather's slipper

1209
01:47:53,675 --> 01:47:54,758
What is this?

1210
01:47:54,842 --> 01:47:58,967
Let me fall at your
feet...forgive me

1211
01:47:59,092 --> 01:48:00,592
What are you doing?

1212
01:48:02,300 --> 01:48:08,383
This bloody rheumatism...
I can't even bend

1213
01:48:08,508 --> 01:48:12,425
Please stop this
Sit down...sit

1214
01:48:15,842 --> 01:48:18,592
Don't say that
no one is a villain

1215
01:48:19,425 --> 01:48:21,758
Not you
me or Zachariah

1216
01:48:22,758 --> 01:48:25,592
Just fathers taking care
of their daughters

1217
01:48:27,300 --> 01:48:31,633
I'm only worried
about telling Varu

1218
01:48:36,258 --> 01:48:38,758
Are you leaving mom
for another woman?

1219
01:48:38,842 --> 01:48:40,550
- No
- Go away

1220
01:48:40,633 --> 01:48:42,133
- Get lost
- Uncle...

1221
01:48:42,717 --> 01:48:44,592
- Get out!
- I'll talk to him!

1222
01:48:45,164 --> 01:48:47,008
You tell amma

1223
01:48:48,633 --> 01:48:49,592
Manohar, come

1224
01:48:57,883 --> 01:49:02,300
- What is it?
- Sit...sit down

1225
01:49:13,883 --> 01:49:16,967
Playing with a cricket ball?
Isn't it dangerous?

1226
01:49:17,050 --> 01:49:18,300
Am I a kid?

1227
01:49:25,842 --> 01:49:28,092
Easy easy...
I'm a kid

1228
01:49:29,050 --> 01:49:32,008
It's obvious
Are you leaving mom?

1229
01:49:46,967 --> 01:49:47,967
I'm going to die

1230
01:49:50,383 --> 01:49:55,050
Liver cirrhosis...from too much
drinking? You won't die if you stop

1231
01:49:57,425 --> 01:50:01,717
My liver is fine...the problem
is Glioblastoma multiforme

1232
01:50:01,800 --> 01:50:09,675
Another name for it is
Grade IV astrocytoma

1233
01:50:18,050 --> 01:50:19,717
...in Tamil, a growth
in the brain

1234
01:50:23,008 --> 01:50:24,008
Cancer?

1235
01:50:34,467 --> 01:50:35,675
Wait...wait...
I'll get it

1236
01:50:41,050 --> 01:50:43,342
- Can you do all this?
- What?

1237
01:50:43,425 --> 01:50:45,592
Playing in the sun?

1238
01:50:47,508 --> 01:50:50,092
How can a Dr dictate?
I'm with my son

1239
01:50:55,842 --> 01:51:00,967
Want to go inside? Or we
could keep playing here

1240
01:51:01,467 --> 01:51:04,967
Not that! What do you
want to do in college?

1241
01:51:05,050 --> 01:51:07,425
As a kid you wanted
to be a lawyer

1242
01:51:07,800 --> 01:51:10,925
- You remember that?
- Of course...how could I forget?

1243
01:51:11,008 --> 01:51:13,758
You were 3 years old
when you said that

1244
01:51:15,175 --> 01:51:16,842
Is that still your goal?

1245
01:51:21,883 --> 01:51:23,300
Why ask now?

1246
01:51:29,258 --> 01:51:30,342
Should have asked...

1247
01:51:34,258 --> 01:51:36,008
Making up for
things I didn't do

1248
01:51:40,425 --> 01:51:42,717
Instead of saying sorry

1249
01:51:44,967 --> 01:51:47,550
Ok, what do you
want to do in college?

1250
01:51:49,467 --> 01:51:50,633
Shall I say it?

1251
01:51:53,217 --> 01:51:57,467
A good writing program
in the UK or Columbia

1252
01:51:59,967 --> 01:52:03,967
Writing...hmm
what will you write?

1253
01:52:07,342 --> 01:52:10,842
Screen...screenplay?

1254
01:52:13,258 --> 01:52:14,550
Why suddenly?

1255
01:52:14,800 --> 01:52:20,883
Not sudden...I've been thinking for a while
I must write a good screenplay

1256
01:52:20,967 --> 01:52:24,050
...and show this Kodambakkam
crowd who you really are

1257
01:52:40,967 --> 01:52:44,550
By the time you're done
with your course

1258
01:52:44,633 --> 01:52:47,675
you might find another
good actor here...

1259
01:52:47,758 --> 01:52:52,217
or you could find one in
Columbia itself, right?

1260
01:52:53,092 --> 01:52:58,383
Perhaps...but they
won't be my dad

1261
01:53:25,883 --> 01:53:29,967
Please this is my private time
Please go away...please

1262
01:53:30,050 --> 01:53:32,425
Go away...please

1263
01:53:42,008 --> 01:53:44,383
This happens to everyone

1264
01:54:03,758 --> 01:54:07,883
Oh god! My baby's
heart will break

1265
01:54:07,967 --> 01:54:10,800
No, we'll take
care of her

1266
01:54:11,133 --> 01:54:15,925
Dhanam, let son-in-law come in
He'll handle it

1267
01:54:16,800 --> 01:54:22,592
That's right! Varalakshmi
can't hear it from anyone else

1268
01:54:22,675 --> 01:54:26,092
- Mano must tell her
- Correct sir, you're correct

1269
01:54:26,175 --> 01:54:28,467
I must be strong
for my son

1270
01:54:30,967 --> 01:54:35,967
I can't just lie around and
weep the whole day

1271
01:54:37,717 --> 01:54:39,258
Oh lord...

1272
01:54:39,508 --> 01:54:42,467
It's heartening to see
you so brave

1273
01:54:43,425 --> 01:54:45,675
I was shattered on
hearing the news

1274
01:54:46,800 --> 01:54:50,175
That godforsaken disease
has united this family

1275
01:54:51,008 --> 01:54:56,300
I confessed I hid Yamini's and
his letters and...he forgave me

1276
01:54:56,592 --> 01:54:59,342
You told him? Why?

1277
01:54:59,425 --> 01:55:01,633
What difference
does it make now?

1278
01:55:01,717 --> 01:55:03,800
When he himself
is leaving us

1279
01:55:05,217 --> 01:55:09,175
Couldn't that godforsaken
tumour be in my brain?

1280
01:55:09,383 --> 01:55:11,175
Who has a brain tumour?

1281
01:55:11,258 --> 01:55:14,508
He...Oh god!

1282
01:55:16,925 --> 01:55:22,842
Mr.Margadarisi and your father
were discussing it, so I thought...

1283
01:55:22,925 --> 01:55:26,592
I didn't know that you don't know
what they know...I'll be downstairs

1284
01:55:26,675 --> 01:55:28,258
- Stop right there
- I've stopped

1285
01:55:29,592 --> 01:55:30,925
Who has a tumour
in the brain?

1286
01:55:31,008 --> 01:55:32,550
If mom finds out

1287
01:55:34,300 --> 01:55:37,883
Stop that! Arpana is here and I've
called for an ambulance

1288
01:55:37,967 --> 01:55:39,217
It'll be fine

1289
01:55:39,342 --> 01:55:44,842
Then why an ambulance?
My baby can't bear this

1290
01:55:44,925 --> 01:55:47,883
Silly woman! What do
you mean 'baby'?

1291
01:55:52,925 --> 01:55:54,592
She must know

1292
01:55:56,633 --> 01:55:57,425
I'll tell her

1293
01:55:57,550 --> 01:56:00,425
Manohar and I will
We have to tell her

1294
01:56:00,800 --> 01:56:02,050
What?

1295
01:56:05,383 --> 01:56:06,675
What is it dear?

1296
01:56:06,842 --> 01:56:11,092
Why didn't you tell...

1297
01:56:12,633 --> 01:56:15,383
My baby! I told you...

1298
01:56:35,592 --> 01:56:42,467
"Is there anything sadder than
immortality? My lord"

1299
01:56:42,550 --> 01:56:49,508
"Will an endless tale
have takers (listeners)? My lord"

1300
01:56:49,592 --> 01:56:58,300
"According to astronomers
the world it seems a round ball"

1301
01:57:03,550 --> 01:57:10,592
"Others globules going around
like it would also die"

1302
01:57:17,550 --> 01:57:28,217
"The allegedly deathless sun
in another eon will also turn to ember"

1303
01:57:31,425 --> 01:57:35,050
"The embers will burn
and burst and later"

1304
01:57:35,175 --> 01:57:38,300
"There will be life sprouting
out of lava again"

1305
01:57:38,383 --> 01:57:41,717
"Like the banana tree
that springs dies"

1306
01:57:41,800 --> 01:57:46,633
"...and springs has a seed
in its every death"

1307
01:57:52,508 --> 01:57:56,217
"Sow another life like
yours and you will"

1308
01:57:56,300 --> 01:58:01,592
"understand the life
in my poems"

1309
01:58:03,050 --> 01:58:09,925
"For your dynasty to live and
for you to serve it as you live"

1310
01:58:10,008 --> 01:58:15,383
"You need a love that rhymes
with your inner poem"

1311
01:58:15,592 --> 01:58:17,383
"Inner poem"

1312
01:58:34,592 --> 01:58:37,967
"A thousand stories abound
of men who got everything"

1313
01:58:38,050 --> 01:58:43,550
"They wished for and
then finally and died"

1314
01:58:43,633 --> 01:58:49,133
"My lord!
Oh My lord!"

1315
01:59:00,300 --> 01:59:02,633
Stop the spinning!

1316
01:59:03,883 --> 01:59:05,883
They have, your Highness

1317
01:59:05,967 --> 01:59:09,175
But the earth is still spinning
Stop that

1318
01:59:09,717 --> 01:59:10,842
But that...

1319
01:59:12,175 --> 01:59:13,467
Ah! I understand

1320
01:59:13,550 --> 01:59:18,967
Wisdom reveals
the true form (nakedness)

1321
01:59:19,133 --> 01:59:23,008
I have been
mistaken about you!

1322
01:59:23,092 --> 01:59:24,717
A great wisdom is
slumbering in you

1323
01:59:24,800 --> 01:59:27,092
Has it been
awakened?

1324
01:59:27,175 --> 01:59:31,175
It's arisen, alight
and I have realized

1325
01:59:31,850 --> 01:59:33,383
Have you realized
impermanence, my King?

1326
01:59:33,467 --> 01:59:34,175
What?

1327
01:59:34,258 --> 01:59:35,758
Impermanance...?

1328
01:59:36,592 --> 01:59:38,550
I have realized love

1329
01:59:38,771 --> 01:59:42,342
Love? You've latched
onto my last 2 sentences?

1330
01:59:42,425 --> 01:59:44,758
Is not the best
saved for last?

1331
01:59:44,842 --> 01:59:50,717
My tongue has been hardened
with talk of blood & gore

1332
01:59:50,800 --> 01:59:52,425
I want to soften it

1333
01:59:52,508 --> 01:59:55,050
Practice on the riverbank with
a mouthful of pebbles to...

1334
01:59:55,133 --> 01:59:58,008
I want to feel love!

1335
01:59:58,092 --> 02:00:00,717
Feel love...you?

1336
02:00:00,800 --> 02:00:05,008
I have felt it
now she must too

1337
02:00:05,133 --> 02:00:09,383
Give us a spell for that
Immortal One!

1338
02:00:10,050 --> 02:00:13,092
- A spell for this...
- Say that you will!

1339
02:00:14,508 --> 02:00:15,550
Say

1340
02:00:15,633 --> 02:00:17,092
As good as said!

1341
02:00:18,300 --> 02:00:19,967
How's this?

1342
02:00:22,383 --> 02:00:23,675
Abra ca dabra

1343
02:00:25,342 --> 02:00:28,592
Abra Karpagavalli

1344
02:00:28,883 --> 02:00:31,092
Oh no! your Majesty!

1345
02:00:31,175 --> 02:00:34,133
- Karpu (Chastity)
- Why do we need that, your Majesty?

1346
02:01:00,800 --> 02:01:02,758
What is the secret
of your tuft?

1347
02:01:03,550 --> 02:01:04,800
Fear

1348
02:01:06,467 --> 02:01:08,342
Verily you are
a good actor

1349
02:01:08,675 --> 02:01:10,300
Why do you say that?

1350
02:01:11,008 --> 02:01:14,008
You act well as
a frightened man

1351
02:01:15,175 --> 02:01:18,508
But I truly am a timid man

1352
02:01:18,925 --> 02:01:25,717
And I have heard of how that timidity
has made a puppet of Mutharasan

1353
02:01:27,008 --> 02:01:29,508
- Congratulations!
- Thank you

1354
02:01:29,592 --> 02:01:33,300
Your proximity is
the first step to our victory

1355
02:01:35,175 --> 02:01:37,967
Why do you grimace?

1356
02:01:38,800 --> 02:01:43,258
The thought of his proximity
to me makes my flesh crawl

1357
02:01:43,550 --> 02:01:47,300
But he wants to be with
you and demands my help

1358
02:01:48,842 --> 02:01:54,633
But would it be real?
It's just an act, O actor!

1359
02:01:56,300 --> 02:01:59,967
I am a man first
only then an actor

1360
02:02:04,717 --> 02:02:06,717
What are you saying

1361
02:02:09,175 --> 02:02:10,633
Immortal One?

1362
02:02:13,008 --> 02:02:15,092
If I do explain it...

1363
02:02:15,883 --> 02:02:21,883
I fear it will be proven by your
hand that I am not immortal

1364
02:02:22,258 --> 02:02:24,508
And yet you say it

1365
02:02:25,217 --> 02:02:26,883
That needs bravery

1366
02:02:29,175 --> 02:02:33,050
Can one have love
without bravery?

1367
02:02:42,883 --> 02:02:49,050
You do not seem to be
of a timid nature

1368
02:02:52,092 --> 02:02:57,050
Mutharasan's prisoner
Karpagavalli-mad

1369
02:02:58,592 --> 02:03:04,092
Immortal street player
Uttaman-a coward

1370
02:03:10,633 --> 02:03:13,883
Calm down, Uttama!
The minister is our man

1371
02:03:13,967 --> 02:03:16,175
Oh! Has he swung
sides then?

1372
02:03:16,258 --> 02:03:19,008
This gorilla doesn't
know how to swing

1373
02:03:19,092 --> 02:03:20,800
...till there is breath
in this body

1374
02:03:20,883 --> 02:03:24,092
- Will you learn now?
- Justice for my King's murder

1375
02:03:24,175 --> 02:03:29,300
...and crowning my Princess
these are the goals of my life

1376
02:03:29,383 --> 02:03:30,508
That is alright then

1377
02:03:31,633 --> 02:03:32,592
What happened?

1378
02:03:32,883 --> 02:03:36,217
A new blade
It pinched my hip

1379
02:03:37,175 --> 02:03:39,717
And this is the one
that helps you plot

1380
02:03:39,800 --> 02:03:44,342
Princess, it's time for our loyal
guards to change shifts

1381
02:03:44,425 --> 02:03:49,342
It is inadvisable for you
to be here after that

1382
02:03:49,425 --> 02:03:53,050
Please return to your prison
We can resume plotting tomorrow

1383
02:03:53,300 --> 02:03:56,467
Uttama, we shall meet again

1384
02:04:12,592 --> 02:04:15,508
Calm down! It is our
neighbouring King's spy

1385
02:04:18,425 --> 02:04:20,467
Princess! Why are you here?

1386
02:04:20,550 --> 02:04:22,675
The spy is almost here
Please go inside

1387
02:04:24,717 --> 02:04:26,508
Who the hell
is whistling?

1388
02:04:26,633 --> 02:04:29,050
It is I, get down with
no more whistling

1389
02:04:29,133 --> 02:04:33,133
Having the same signal for
both Kingdoms is a nuisance

1390
02:04:33,217 --> 02:04:34,383
Couldn't you just change it?

1391
02:04:34,467 --> 02:04:35,967
- We did
- To what

1392
02:04:36,050 --> 02:04:36,883
A cough

1393
02:04:37,008 --> 02:04:38,300
What happened
to the cough?

1394
02:04:38,383 --> 02:04:41,883
Just then, our erstwhile King
had a bad congestion

1395
02:04:42,300 --> 02:04:44,217
He coughed the whole day long

1396
02:04:44,342 --> 02:04:47,842
...and every secret entry
in the palace opened and closed

1397
02:04:47,925 --> 02:04:49,883
...till everyone
knew of them

1398
02:04:49,967 --> 02:04:51,425
including Mutharasan

1399
02:04:51,925 --> 02:04:53,550
You've finally arrived

1400
02:04:54,342 --> 02:04:58,383
Minister! I bring my King's word
your problems will soon be solved

1401
02:04:58,467 --> 02:05:02,925
We asked your King's help
not his astrological predictions

1402
02:05:03,050 --> 02:05:06,258
And also you've been
saying this for 8 months

1403
02:05:06,342 --> 02:05:08,758
What does your
Sengoottuvan say now?

1404
02:05:10,592 --> 02:05:12,342
He is our man
Fear not

1405
02:05:12,467 --> 02:05:13,883
You! Stand back

1406
02:05:14,342 --> 02:05:17,633
- That is all
- That is all?

1407
02:05:18,050 --> 02:05:19,425
Did you shove
me for this?

1408
02:05:19,508 --> 02:05:22,425
Did you hang from
that rope just for this?

1409
02:05:22,508 --> 02:05:24,175
Our princess is
so worried

1410
02:05:24,258 --> 02:05:30,883
Should you not have asked your
King about a better reply for her?

1411
02:05:30,967 --> 02:05:33,383
This is the most I've
spoken before my King

1412
02:05:33,467 --> 02:05:36,633
May be so but
we don't need him

1413
02:05:36,717 --> 02:05:39,300
our Uttama's plan...

1414
02:05:40,383 --> 02:05:43,592
But it's none of your business
Right Uttama?

1415
02:05:43,675 --> 02:05:45,675
- Absolutely not!
- What are you...?

1416
02:05:45,800 --> 02:05:49,925
Go tell your King
we will manage...go!

1417
02:05:55,383 --> 02:05:57,800
These neighbouring
spies are polite

1418
02:06:00,633 --> 02:06:04,008
Seems he's too
lazy to climb

1419
02:06:04,092 --> 02:06:05,675
Is there an another way out?

1420
02:06:05,758 --> 02:06:09,425
That path straight
ahead will take you up

1421
02:06:09,508 --> 02:06:12,592
Thank you, my lord! We're
exhausted lifting this fatso

1422
02:06:17,883 --> 02:06:19,925
Uttama, I must go too

1423
02:06:30,550 --> 02:06:32,508
You forgot your tuft

1424
02:06:33,217 --> 02:06:36,925
However, I praise
your acting talent

1425
02:06:37,008 --> 02:06:40,717
It is my duty
to reward it

1426
02:06:41,467 --> 02:06:45,008
Your spell will soon
make me fall in love

1427
02:06:45,133 --> 02:06:49,217
...with Mutharasan
Go tell him

1428
02:06:53,842 --> 02:06:54,925
What is this?

1429
02:06:55,008 --> 02:06:57,425
It's the scene you
asked me to show, sir

1430
02:06:57,508 --> 02:06:59,092
Yes, but in the hospital?

1431
02:06:59,175 --> 02:07:00,217
Sorry sir

1432
02:07:00,300 --> 02:07:02,592
No no
It is I who asked him

1433
02:07:02,675 --> 02:07:05,717
They're running all these tests
and I was a bit tense

1434
02:07:10,592 --> 02:07:14,092
God is taking from me
what I took from Yamini

1435
02:07:14,675 --> 02:07:17,425
I'll be left only with
what is meant to be mine

1436
02:07:18,967 --> 02:07:21,883
- I can wait outside
- No Dr

1437
02:07:22,883 --> 02:07:24,967
You are like family

1438
02:07:26,008 --> 02:07:29,467
You must be here when
I beg his forgiveness

1439
02:07:29,592 --> 02:07:32,425
He loved Yamini so
deeply, you know?

1440
02:07:32,633 --> 02:07:36,717
But I threw
a tantrum like a brat

1441
02:07:36,800 --> 02:07:40,758
and got my father
to marry us

1442
02:07:43,675 --> 02:07:47,633
Honestly, don't you
still love Yamini?

1443
02:07:47,717 --> 02:07:49,550
Atleast let her
soul hear it

1444
02:07:49,592 --> 02:07:53,258
- Souls don't have ears, ok?
- But I do!

1445
02:07:53,592 --> 02:07:55,800
So, still you love her?

1446
02:08:07,133 --> 02:08:08,758
- Rest now
- How?

1447
02:08:09,637 --> 02:08:10,401
What dear?

1448
02:08:11,300 --> 02:08:15,092
How can you still love me
after I've destroyed it?

1449
02:08:18,217 --> 02:08:21,175
I married you because
of anger toward Yamini

1450
02:08:21,258 --> 02:08:23,342
...out of that
grew affection

1451
02:08:23,842 --> 02:08:27,717
You are a nice person so
affection turned into love

1452
02:08:28,550 --> 02:08:31,383
Now I know Yamini
did no wrong...

1453
02:08:31,467 --> 02:08:33,592
- You're angry with me
- No no no no

1454
02:08:33,675 --> 02:08:37,050
I'm not angry with you
You're the mother of my child

1455
02:08:37,133 --> 02:08:39,758
You're a child yourself
A beautiful child

1456
02:08:39,842 --> 02:08:43,258
Stop trying to
pacify me with lies

1457
02:08:43,675 --> 02:08:44,758
No Varu

1458
02:08:50,217 --> 02:08:53,508
I was very beautiful when
I was younger, isn't it?

1459
02:08:54,633 --> 02:08:56,842
I ate my
beauty away

1460
02:08:57,675 --> 02:09:01,050
My heart is heavy when
I weigh myself

1461
02:09:01,800 --> 02:09:03,592
That is an extra weight

1462
02:09:04,467 --> 02:09:08,800
I was petrified he'd leave me
for a beautiful girl like Yamini

1463
02:09:10,008 --> 02:09:13,175
But fear isn't enough
I've to watch my mouth also

1464
02:09:13,967 --> 02:09:17,842
Lazy glutton!
Worthless creature!

1465
02:09:20,258 --> 02:09:21,925
I've given you a sedative

1466
02:09:22,008 --> 02:09:27,175
No Dr, please don't
I want to keep looking at him

1467
02:09:27,258 --> 02:09:29,467
Give me something
to stay awake

1468
02:09:29,550 --> 02:09:32,008
I will...I will Please rest now
Please Varu

1469
02:09:32,092 --> 02:09:34,342
I don't want
anything else

1470
02:09:34,425 --> 02:09:36,342
Shut up...will you
listen to me?

1471
02:09:36,467 --> 02:09:38,717
Atleast now, you mean?

1472
02:09:38,883 --> 02:09:44,425
Oh God! We realize the value of
things only when we lose them

1473
02:09:44,550 --> 02:09:48,467
...for fools like me
so tired...

1474
02:10:29,758 --> 02:10:34,717
I felt scalded
by Varu's words

1475
02:10:45,675 --> 02:10:49,967
Thiruna is a loyal man
Completely trustworthy

1476
02:10:51,008 --> 02:10:52,175
Thank you, sir

1477
02:10:52,967 --> 02:10:57,717
I swear I've never breathed
a word to madam at home

1478
02:10:59,675 --> 02:11:02,925
I know, Thiruna
That's what I said

1479
02:11:03,008 --> 02:11:05,300
I'd give my life
for him, sir

1480
02:11:06,217 --> 02:11:09,300
No need for that
You have a good future

1481
02:11:09,383 --> 02:11:11,258
and I've gotten
you a good job

1482
02:11:13,175 --> 02:11:21,217
My friend Wasim in Dubai
I've told him you're my greatest treasure

1483
02:11:21,300 --> 02:11:23,633
and he must look
after you well

1484
02:11:25,842 --> 02:11:28,300
What's this! Ok, pull
over and let me drive

1485
02:11:28,383 --> 02:11:32,925
No sir, I'll drive
You said I'm your treasure

1486
02:11:33,008 --> 02:11:37,175
That's all I need
Thank you, sir

1487
02:11:46,175 --> 02:11:48,842
Am I your treasure or trouble?

1488
02:12:09,258 --> 02:12:12,300
What do you want, my love?

1489
02:12:17,842 --> 02:12:19,967
She must live with
good health

1490
02:12:22,342 --> 02:12:24,717
and I, without embarrassment

1491
02:12:29,342 --> 02:12:37,758
So the 3 men in this car must
swear to keep this secret

1492
02:12:50,592 --> 02:12:53,883
I swear on my child, madam

1493
02:12:59,008 --> 02:13:00,300
Please...

1494
02:13:05,925 --> 02:13:07,883
They might
ask in heaven

1495
02:13:10,967 --> 02:13:16,550
But I can always lie my way through
I am an actor, right?

1496
02:13:34,925 --> 02:13:38,758
"At the altar of
God called love"

1497
02:13:38,842 --> 02:13:42,133
"In the temple
called eyes"

1498
02:13:42,633 --> 02:13:53,300
"The thirst of
the body is worship"

1499
02:14:01,383 --> 02:14:05,217
"At the altar of
God called love"

1500
02:14:05,300 --> 02:14:09,050
"In the temple
called eyes"

1501
02:14:09,133 --> 02:14:21,050
"The thirst of
the body is worship"

1502
02:14:21,425 --> 02:14:24,550
This game is yours!
You've done some magic

1503
02:14:26,342 --> 02:14:28,467
Your Highness!
Your Highness!

1504
02:14:30,342 --> 02:14:31,467
Come

1505
02:14:32,217 --> 02:14:33,883
Your Highness!
There-

1506
02:14:37,550 --> 02:14:38,717
What?

1507
02:14:38,758 --> 02:14:42,383
The Princess was calling
your name in her sleep

1508
02:14:47,842 --> 02:14:48,758
And then?

1509
02:14:48,842 --> 02:14:52,425
I ignored it thinking
it a nightmare

1510
02:14:52,508 --> 02:14:54,592
- What?
- But in the morning

1511
02:14:54,717 --> 02:14:56,800
- And in the morning?
- She was all decked up

1512
02:14:56,883 --> 02:14:58,883
- Decked up and?
- Oozing sensuality

1513
02:14:58,967 --> 02:15:01,592
- Sensuality and?
- Lost in yearning

1514
02:15:01,675 --> 02:15:04,675
- Yearning and?
- She is singing!

1515
02:15:04,967 --> 02:15:06,383
Singing what?

1516
02:15:09,925 --> 02:15:13,758
"At the alter of
God called love"

1517
02:15:14,383 --> 02:15:18,342
"In the temple
called eyes"

1518
02:15:18,758 --> 02:15:23,925
"The thirst of
the body is worsh-"

1519
02:15:24,008 --> 02:15:28,467
Your yearning itself
is stealing my heart

1520
02:15:33,258 --> 02:15:35,342
Sandal paste...quickly!

1521
02:15:41,925 --> 02:15:44,175
Is my breath stinking?

1522
02:15:46,258 --> 02:15:49,258
It's the fragrance of arrack
and dry fish, your Highness

1523
02:15:51,217 --> 02:15:53,717
Cloves!
Bring me cloves!

1524
02:15:54,175 --> 02:15:55,300
Your Highness!

1525
02:15:55,592 --> 02:15:57,883
It's more eat
reduce your libido

1526
02:15:57,967 --> 02:16:02,092
- Cloves reduce what?
- Your libido, your Highness

1527
02:16:04,717 --> 02:16:06,342
Uthama
Now check

1528
02:16:09,800 --> 02:16:13,633
Get me gold jewels,
silk dhoti and...

1529
02:16:13,717 --> 02:16:16,842
No no, pearls and
normal clothes will do

1530
02:16:16,925 --> 02:16:18,883
...it takes too
long to remove

1531
02:16:21,717 --> 02:16:23,383
Why do you weep?

1532
02:16:24,925 --> 02:16:28,133
Won't I weep if you blow cloves
in my eyes, your Highness?

1533
02:16:31,300 --> 02:16:34,800
"At the alter of
God called love"

1534
02:16:38,675 --> 02:16:42,842
"In the temple
called eyes"

1535
02:17:01,717 --> 02:17:09,258
"This is the boat to
ride the rapids of lust"

1536
02:17:09,300 --> 02:17:16,925
"This is the boat that
comes with sails of want"

1537
02:17:17,050 --> 02:17:20,967
"While wandering in
search of shores"

1538
02:17:21,050 --> 02:17:24,592
"Life shall melt like wax"

1539
02:17:24,717 --> 02:17:32,550
"Like those fingers that play the harp
I am plucked and strummed to please"

1540
02:17:32,633 --> 02:17:36,092
"At the alter of
God called love"

1541
02:17:36,217 --> 02:17:39,467
"In the temple
called eyes"

1542
02:17:39,550 --> 02:17:51,592
"The thirst of
the body is worship"

1543
02:18:22,008 --> 02:18:29,300
"Do reuniting lovers
need to converse?"

1544
02:18:29,383 --> 02:18:37,092
"Would words ever come
in the way of expressing amour?"

1545
02:18:37,175 --> 02:18:44,758
"Like the rhythm that sets the timing
for music come mingle with me"

1546
02:18:44,842 --> 02:18:48,550
"Come reach me to
the very peak of ecstasy"

1547
02:18:48,633 --> 02:18:52,592
"...and whisper endearments
in my ear"

1548
02:18:52,675 --> 02:18:56,258
"At the alter of
God called love"

1549
02:18:56,383 --> 02:19:00,133
"In the temple
called eyes"

1550
02:19:00,217 --> 02:19:11,883
"The thirst of
the body is worship"

1551
02:19:37,800 --> 02:19:45,842
Immortal One, I make you
Minister as reward for this miracle

1552
02:19:59,717 --> 02:20:04,092
Why a third Minister
when you already have 2?

1553
02:20:04,175 --> 02:20:09,550
Not 3! 2 as always
1 Minister...will go

1554
02:20:09,633 --> 02:20:17,342
- Oh no! Who will go?
- We'll decide with a roll of the dice

1555
02:20:18,758 --> 02:20:23,967
Fear not! I'll sacrifice
my post for our friendship

1556
02:20:24,050 --> 02:20:27,883
- You're a true friend...promise?
- On your life!

1557
02:20:27,967 --> 02:20:32,592
Your Highness...Highness
Here! Here!

1558
02:20:34,300 --> 02:20:36,258
- Your Highness!
- What

1559
02:20:36,383 --> 02:20:41,758
Don't worry! Kaakapusundar
is ready to relinquish his post

1560
02:20:44,342 --> 02:20:47,342
I and Uttama will be
your confidantes

1561
02:20:47,717 --> 02:20:50,300
Is this the time to
discuss it? Get out

1562
02:20:51,133 --> 02:20:53,842
- Me too?
- Then what? Out!

1563
02:20:54,550 --> 02:20:58,883
Now its me and
my Karpagam

1564
02:21:01,633 --> 02:21:05,550
I can't wait any longer, Karpu

1565
02:21:07,717 --> 02:21:09,175
Did you say something?

1566
02:21:13,133 --> 02:21:16,758
It says I can't
wait any longer

1567
02:21:21,300 --> 02:21:22,717
I'll just be back!

1568
02:21:25,758 --> 02:21:30,175
- Shall I go too?
- I have to go!

1569
02:21:31,092 --> 02:21:32,508
What happened?

1570
02:21:33,717 --> 02:21:40,383
Your Highness, could ride the palanquin
...without anxiety or spillage

1571
02:21:40,467 --> 02:21:41,717
That's right

1572
02:21:47,925 --> 02:21:51,050
No! Not to the entrance
Go to the toilets

1573
02:21:56,883 --> 02:21:58,675
Hurry up!

1574
02:22:00,258 --> 02:22:03,800
Stop! Why do you blow
every time I point?

1575
02:22:03,883 --> 02:22:08,592
Yes! The King is in a rush
and you keep sputtering...

1576
02:22:08,675 --> 02:22:11,842
Uttama...you too?

1577
02:22:13,258 --> 02:22:16,883
- Why have you stopped?
- It was your command

1578
02:22:16,967 --> 02:22:20,883
Your King needs to go
Move!

1579
02:22:20,967 --> 02:22:27,133
- No jolting! No jiggling!
- No jolting! No jiggling!

1580
02:22:43,175 --> 02:22:44,758
Uttama!

1581
02:22:45,092 --> 02:22:48,592
I'm exhausted running
between toilet and bath

1582
02:22:48,717 --> 02:22:52,092
And my dream girl
Karpagam, awaits me

1583
02:22:52,170 --> 02:22:58,967
My love is all back-to-front
Oh God! I'm dying

1584
02:22:59,092 --> 02:23:01,758
You have tested me enough
Uttama!

1585
02:23:02,800 --> 02:23:03,675
Come

1586
02:23:04,758 --> 02:23:08,550
Impart to me
the secret of immortality

1587
02:23:08,633 --> 02:23:12,175
- Ah! She keeps jolting me...
- Your Highness

1588
02:23:13,217 --> 02:23:18,300
- This spell you ask for...
- Physician, stop it! Stop!

1589
02:23:18,925 --> 02:23:24,133
...is not a mystery but must be
understood with wisdom

1590
02:23:24,217 --> 02:23:28,675
You seek to teach a fish to swim?
I am the wisest! Proceed

1591
02:23:29,550 --> 02:23:33,217
It's very simple
There are three methods

1592
02:23:33,300 --> 02:23:37,133
One-is to be
the wisest among the wise

1593
02:23:37,217 --> 02:23:40,217
A sage who comprehends the three
dimensions of time and motion

1594
02:23:40,300 --> 02:23:43,133
Oh! I loosely understood
the theory of time and motion

1595
02:23:43,217 --> 02:23:47,842
I've just calmed down
Tell me a shortcut

1596
02:23:47,925 --> 02:23:51,050
You must compose
an immortal epic

1597
02:23:52,758 --> 02:23:56,592
- My handwriting isn't very good
- It could be oral!

1598
02:23:56,675 --> 02:23:58,675
Aren't my troubles
enough already?

1599
02:23:58,758 --> 02:24:01,133
That's why he
refuses 1 and 2

1600
02:24:01,217 --> 02:24:02,717
Shut up!

1601
02:24:02,800 --> 02:24:04,800
Highness...what is
the third option?

1602
02:24:04,883 --> 02:24:07,467
- There is a third...there is
- What is it? What?

1603
02:24:07,550 --> 02:24:13,342
Another way is to be a great
and unforgettable artiste

1604
02:24:13,425 --> 02:24:17,675
Understood! You've saved
the best idea for last

1605
02:24:17,758 --> 02:24:20,592
Nowadays it's the easiest
thing to become an actor

1606
02:24:20,675 --> 02:24:24,175
Suggest a good drama as soon
as my stomach settles down

1607
02:24:24,258 --> 02:24:27,633
Your Highness! Drama
is below our dignity

1608
02:24:29,550 --> 02:24:32,592
Why, haven't the great
emperors been playwrights?

1609
02:24:32,675 --> 02:24:36,925
Well said! Our King's touch
makes anything respectable

1610
02:24:37,050 --> 02:24:39,133
No no. Ignore him
Keep scratching

1611
02:24:39,217 --> 02:24:40,800
I've a good idea
for a play

1612
02:24:40,883 --> 02:24:43,008
- What about 'Ballad of Hiranyan'?
- Let's do it!

1613
02:24:43,092 --> 02:24:45,342
I know only of
'Ballad of Prahalada'

1614
02:24:45,675 --> 02:24:47,342
This is his father's tale

1615
02:24:47,425 --> 02:24:50,550
Oh no! But doesn't he
oppose Lord Narayana?

1616
02:24:50,633 --> 02:24:54,592
For heaven's sake! Only he who dares
to oppose all, can become immortal

1617
02:24:54,717 --> 02:25:01,050
- Fear is the (root) of death
- I've neither (roots) nor (shoots)

1618
02:25:01,092 --> 02:25:07,092
To prove I am fearless
we stage 'Ballad of Hiranyan'!

1619
02:25:19,883 --> 02:25:23,967
As your Highness said
your pulse is racing

1620
02:25:24,050 --> 02:25:27,175
Oh God! And I thought
it was easy to be an actor

1621
02:25:33,633 --> 02:25:36,633
Forget that, there are
5 demons, my King

1622
02:25:37,092 --> 02:25:38,842
Not four?

1623
02:25:38,925 --> 02:25:41,633
That's the scriptures
Demons are 5!

1624
02:25:41,717 --> 02:25:43,550
Tell them to reduce a bit

1625
02:25:43,675 --> 02:25:45,300
Scriptures or Demons?

1626
02:25:45,383 --> 02:25:50,383
The dialog! It's endless
Shouldn't we talk less and say more?

1627
02:25:50,467 --> 02:25:56,758
Which part has less dialog? Which?
This one...Prahalad

1628
02:25:56,842 --> 02:26:03,175
That's true but he's a young boy
It wouldn't suit your Highness

1629
02:26:03,258 --> 02:26:05,467
- There he is!
- Your Highness!

1630
02:26:05,592 --> 02:26:08,258
- What?
- What about Narasimhan?

1631
02:26:09,383 --> 02:26:12,425
The dialog isn't
too much, right?

1632
02:26:12,508 --> 02:26:15,967
None at all
Just roars

1633
02:26:16,300 --> 02:26:18,717
A little stronger than that

1634
02:26:18,800 --> 02:26:21,800
- Your lion's roar
- This costume is a nuisance as well

1635
02:26:21,883 --> 02:26:24,967
Minister, the poison
will work, won't it?

1636
02:26:25,050 --> 02:26:28,467
Narasimhan's nails are
soaked in poison and well dried

1637
02:26:29,800 --> 02:26:32,508
It will kill us
if the poison touches us

1638
02:26:32,633 --> 02:26:35,800
Hence the drummer's
finger-shields I ordered for you

1639
02:26:35,883 --> 02:26:38,800
So that you may
be successful

1640
02:26:40,300 --> 02:26:43,967
Karpagavalli is my shield
I'll rip him apart

1641
02:26:44,092 --> 02:26:48,592
So that you steal the applause?

1642
02:26:48,675 --> 02:26:54,258
Impossible! Dasarath...uh
Hiraniyan has all the dialog

1643
02:26:54,342 --> 02:26:59,633
- And that is the problem
- All the glory falls on Narasimhan

1644
02:26:59,717 --> 02:27:02,133
But Narasimhan is
half god and half animal

1645
02:27:02,217 --> 02:27:05,258
Hiraniyan is all king
Who is greater?

1646
02:27:05,342 --> 02:27:11,508
Narasimhan! It is the union of half god-
half animal that will last in people's hearts

1647
02:27:11,592 --> 02:27:16,467
Correct! We will exchange roles
You are Hiraniyan and I, Narasimhan

1648
02:27:16,550 --> 02:27:19,092
But...your audience is waiting

1649
02:27:19,175 --> 02:27:21,675
It is I they are awaiting

1650
02:27:21,758 --> 02:27:25,967
Announce to them that
their King is changing his makeup

1651
02:27:26,050 --> 02:27:28,217
Cut it
Come

1652
02:27:29,217 --> 02:27:31,425
Super, my boy!
Brilliant!

1653
02:27:36,633 --> 02:27:38,092
Fantastic!

1654
02:27:38,717 --> 02:27:41,800
Now lunch and
then dress change

1655
02:27:41,883 --> 02:27:47,133
Return in the Hiraniyan costume
The climax and song are almost done

1656
02:27:47,217 --> 02:27:49,383
We just have to
complete the lead

1657
02:27:49,467 --> 02:27:50,050
We'll finish it

1658
02:27:50,133 --> 02:27:52,508
Once that's done
the film is complete

1659
02:27:52,592 --> 02:27:53,633
We'll do that today, sir

1660
02:27:53,717 --> 02:27:55,592
- Are you tired?
- Everything alright?

1661
02:27:55,675 --> 02:27:59,550
I know you,
but ok, hurry back

1662
02:27:59,633 --> 02:28:03,008
- The scene is good, isn't it?
- Wonderful! But how are you?

1663
02:28:03,842 --> 02:28:06,217
Really?

1664
02:28:06,842 --> 02:28:08,717
- Really
- Really

1665
02:28:10,800 --> 02:28:13,175
- Was it good?
- Whatever you do is good

1666
02:28:13,258 --> 02:28:14,467
Amazing

1667
02:28:17,342 --> 02:28:18,425
From whom?

1668
02:28:20,467 --> 02:28:23,175
Well, it isn't exactly for you
It's a letter I wrote your mother

1669
02:28:23,258 --> 02:28:25,967
It never reached her
I want you to read it

1670
02:28:33,342 --> 02:28:37,175
Take the children to the room
I'll bring our lunch there

1671
02:28:37,342 --> 02:28:38,967
You sure?

1672
02:28:44,925 --> 02:28:46,050
Yamini

1673
02:28:46,925 --> 02:28:52,383
I know the news we
await is tidings of great joy

1674
02:28:53,758 --> 02:28:57,717
Fortune has smiled
twice on this poor man

1675
02:28:59,592 --> 02:29:02,175
One was, the first time
I saw you

1676
02:29:02,550 --> 02:29:08,508
The other, when people
acknowledged my stardom

1677
02:29:09,633 --> 02:29:12,050
Mr. Poornachanra Rao
threatens me

1678
02:29:12,967 --> 02:29:14,342
Varalakshmi too

1679
02:29:15,758 --> 02:29:18,883
She is steadfast in her delusion
that her infatuation for me

1680
02:29:18,967 --> 02:29:23,592
will turn into
my love for her

1681
02:29:24,758 --> 02:29:27,758
When I told her
it's impossible

1682
02:29:27,842 --> 02:29:32,008
she slit her wrists

1683
02:29:35,842 --> 02:29:37,467
and is lying in the hospital

1684
02:29:38,842 --> 02:29:42,842
I told him I couldn't marry his
daughter because I love you

1685
02:29:44,008 --> 02:29:46,008
Do you know
what he said?

1686
02:29:46,967 --> 02:29:49,383
That he can wash
away love with money

1687
02:29:50,383 --> 02:29:53,300
In my anger, I lied to
him that you're pregnant

1688
02:29:53,956 --> 02:29:55,342
The man was stunned

1689
02:29:57,592 --> 02:30:00,717
And then suggested
that abortion is a solution

1690
02:30:06,300 --> 02:30:13,883
This lie I told about your
pregnancy...we must make it true

1691
02:30:15,758 --> 02:30:17,342
And if that happens

1692
02:30:19,883 --> 02:30:22,008
As we've decided

1693
02:30:23,508 --> 02:30:25,467
Manohar
if it's a boy

1694
02:30:27,383 --> 02:30:29,383
and Manonmani
if it's a girl

1695
02:30:35,050 --> 02:30:38,883
Who knows, it
could even be twins

1696
02:30:41,467 --> 02:30:46,300
I am ready to leave
everything behind for you

1697
02:30:49,342 --> 02:30:51,175
Will you wait for me?

1698
02:31:25,383 --> 02:31:26,175
That...

1699
02:31:27,175 --> 02:31:28,383
That's my photo

1700
02:31:29,133 --> 02:31:31,008
- Did dad give it to you?
- Yes

1701
02:31:31,092 --> 02:31:32,008
What is this?

1702
02:31:33,550 --> 02:31:35,842
A collage of everyone I know

1703
02:31:42,842 --> 02:31:45,217
The surgery might
wipe out my memory

1704
02:31:46,050 --> 02:31:48,175
So it's like reminder
notes to myself

1705
02:31:48,300 --> 02:31:50,675
In-laws, my teacher

1706
02:31:50,758 --> 02:31:53,842
Shall I call your dad...
I mean Mr. Zachariah?

1707
02:32:13,925 --> 02:32:16,508
I thought Manohar
would be alone

1708
02:32:17,217 --> 02:32:18,967
Don't jump to conclusions

1709
02:32:19,217 --> 02:32:21,800
And what?
She's your sister?

1710
02:32:21,925 --> 02:32:23,467
She is my sister

1711
02:32:27,550 --> 02:32:29,550
Dad, please tell her!

1712
02:32:29,633 --> 02:32:31,383
But this is my sister!

1713
02:32:35,008 --> 02:32:38,092
And after I've cut off
my hair for you...

1714
02:32:46,925 --> 02:32:50,467
- His own sister?
- Yes. From another mother

1715
02:32:54,133 --> 02:32:55,383
See for yourself

1716
02:32:59,092 --> 02:33:00,133
I didn't mean you

1717
02:33:01,550 --> 02:33:04,217
Please come in and
tell her, sir please sir

1718
02:33:04,342 --> 02:33:08,467
The seed of my blood
The flesh of my flesh

1719
02:33:08,550 --> 02:33:11,883
How'll I bear him
addressing another as God

1720
02:33:11,967 --> 02:33:15,092
Bringforth Prahalada!
I shall cognize by querying him

1721
02:33:15,175 --> 02:33:20,258
My son worships another after
the world has proclaimed me God?

1722
02:33:20,342 --> 02:33:22,300
Repent for your sin

1723
02:33:22,383 --> 02:33:25,217
And chant your
father's name thus

1724
02:33:33,258 --> 02:33:36,717
I messed it up
I said 'This' instead of 'Thus'

1725
02:33:36,800 --> 02:33:38,342
No no, it's fine by me

1726
02:33:38,425 --> 02:33:42,133
I'll intercut footage
from both cameras

1727
02:33:42,217 --> 02:33:44,092
Come and see
if you want

1728
02:33:46,550 --> 02:33:48,883
I said 'This'
instead of 'Thus'

1729
02:33:49,425 --> 02:33:52,550
- Is that ok, sir?
- That's fine let it go

1730
02:33:52,633 --> 02:33:54,300
Repent for your sin

1731
02:33:54,383 --> 02:33:57,258
And chant your
father's name thus

1732
02:34:03,675 --> 02:34:05,425
One minute, look at me

1733
02:34:13,758 --> 02:34:16,175
Oh God!
Oh God!

1734
02:34:23,508 --> 02:34:25,633
Hey! what happen to sir?

1735
02:34:51,842 --> 02:34:53,842
It's nothing...it's nothing

1736
02:34:57,675 --> 02:34:59,633
What is this?
He's bald

1737
02:34:59,717 --> 02:35:02,675
It's because of the chemo, sir
It's not important now

1738
02:35:42,842 --> 02:35:45,008
- Sir
- What?

1739
02:35:45,092 --> 02:35:48,175
Sir, let me try it
just one more...

1740
02:35:48,258 --> 02:35:51,342
I know...you can do better

1741
02:35:51,425 --> 02:35:54,092
But go to
the hospital now

1742
02:35:54,175 --> 02:35:57,425
I'll come and show
you the edited footage

1743
02:35:57,508 --> 02:36:00,967
Listen to me
atleast this once

1744
02:36:08,175 --> 02:36:11,217
Come, sister! Manonmani!
Yes, you

1745
02:36:12,217 --> 02:36:13,633
Close the door

1746
02:37:19,342 --> 02:37:21,383
Uncle, the surgery
is underway

1747
02:37:22,175 --> 02:37:23,050
Is it?

1748
02:37:30,675 --> 02:37:33,675
He's done this
brilliant shot

1749
02:37:33,758 --> 02:37:38,425
Fantastic! No one
else can do it

1750
02:37:41,092 --> 02:37:42,258
Come, show it to them

1751
02:37:42,342 --> 02:37:44,967
- Sir, shall I play it on the tv?
- Is that possible?

1752
02:37:45,050 --> 02:37:46,675
- Possible sir
- Show it

1753
02:37:47,300 --> 02:37:51,842
But keep the volume low
This is a hospital

1754
02:37:59,258 --> 02:38:01,883
Rao ji...he's my disciple

1755
02:38:05,842 --> 02:38:07,092
...and your son-in-law

1756
02:38:18,425 --> 02:38:21,342
Slowly and gently...

1757
02:38:27,217 --> 02:38:29,383
Do revive me
Don't forget

1758
02:38:56,175 --> 02:39:00,300
The seed of my blood
The flesh of my flesh

1759
02:39:00,383 --> 02:39:03,800
How'll I bear him
addressing another as God

1760
02:39:03,883 --> 02:39:07,050
Bringforth Prahalada!
I shall cognize by querying him

1761
02:39:27,508 --> 02:39:33,675
"Me with God to guard salute
you Sire, with none to guard"

1762
02:39:33,758 --> 02:39:35,717
"Come, my son, come!"

1763
02:39:35,800 --> 02:39:39,925
"With your little fingers, twirl
the hair on my magnificent chest!"

1764
02:39:40,008 --> 02:39:42,008
"Come, my son, come!"

1765
02:39:42,092 --> 02:39:48,592
"Our elders declare as
atheist; the name that you chant"

1766
02:39:48,675 --> 02:39:51,508
"When the world
acknowledges Hiraniyan as God"

1767
02:39:51,633 --> 02:39:53,508
"How can his son
worship another?"

1768
02:39:53,592 --> 02:39:58,883
"Right your sin
Chant your father's name thus"

1769
02:39:58,967 --> 02:40:07,675
"O Immortal One!
Hail!"

1770
02:40:07,758 --> 02:40:11,425
"Know you the prayer
to chant? Behold!"

1771
02:40:11,508 --> 02:40:15,633
"Hail O Hiranya!"

1772
02:40:23,050 --> 02:40:24,217
"Yes...say it"

1773
02:40:24,300 --> 02:40:28,508
"Hail O! Narayana"

1774
02:40:32,633 --> 02:40:34,592
"Who be this Narayana?"

1775
02:40:34,675 --> 02:40:36,800
"When I am worshipped
to the 8 directions"

1776
02:40:36,883 --> 02:40:41,217
"My son worships another?
I dare any to say there in my equal!"

1777
02:40:41,300 --> 02:40:45,467
"An object of the 5 senses?
A form of the 4 seriptures?"

1778
02:40:45,550 --> 02:40:47,550
"Night & day, Outside & In
Nowhere can I die!"

1779
02:40:47,633 --> 02:40:49,717
"This is my boon
of immortality"

1780
02:40:49,800 --> 02:40:52,967
"Know this, Know this
Know this...you"

1781
02:40:54,092 --> 02:40:58,133
"I am an epic
without end"

1782
02:40:58,258 --> 02:41:04,133
"O Immortal One!
Hail!"

1783
02:41:04,675 --> 02:41:13,258
"Born ignorant mortals
We wander, meander"

1784
02:41:13,717 --> 02:41:21,633
"We realized the chant 'Hari Om'
We attained ascent as human"

1785
02:41:23,633 --> 02:41:27,925
"You have listened to demented yarns
You are wilted and spoilt"

1786
02:41:28,008 --> 02:41:32,133
"You are chanting the name of that villain
You nothing! You fool!"

1787
02:41:32,217 --> 02:41:36,467
"No gender, transgender
Nor snake, tiger, fox nor dog"

1788
02:41:36,550 --> 02:41:40,883
"None of these life forms can kill me
Know this! Know this!"

1789
02:41:41,008 --> 02:41:44,925
"Yes I do know
Nevertheless Hari Om!"

1790
02:41:45,008 --> 02:41:48,925
"Your voice is also
that of Hari"

1791
02:41:49,008 --> 02:41:51,300
"I've been blessed with
the boon of immortality"

1792
02:41:51,383 --> 02:41:53,217
"And of unending life"

1793
02:41:53,300 --> 02:41:55,592
"If you walk your path
unheeding the right path"

1794
02:41:55,675 --> 02:41:57,758
"Chant 'Hari' blasphemy"

1795
02:41:57,842 --> 02:41:59,633
"You'll repent
with your life"

1796
02:41:59,717 --> 02:42:08,175
"I want not the life where
I cannot chant His name"

1797
02:42:08,258 --> 02:42:16,133
"He claims to be a fish, a tortoise
and shamelessly, a pig too!"

1798
02:42:21,508 --> 02:42:24,967
"All pervasive is 'Hari'"

1799
02:42:25,050 --> 02:42:27,675
"He resides in everything"

1800
02:42:27,758 --> 02:42:31,800
"If anyone and
anything can be God"

1801
02:42:38,717 --> 02:42:45,008
"Come! Show me
where your 'Hari' is!"

1802
02:43:31,800 --> 02:43:35,425
"The tyrant is dead
Killing himself instead"

1803
02:43:35,550 --> 02:43:41,300
"Behold the cost of murder!"

1804
02:43:51,092 --> 02:43:55,717
Behold! We have completed
the task without your King's help

1805
02:43:55,800 --> 02:43:59,508
But it was our King who saved
you in the guise of Uttaman

1806
02:45:46,842 --> 02:45:52,633
"Is there anything
sadder than immortality?"

1807
02:45:52,717 --> 02:45:58,133
"Will there be listeners
for an endless tale?"

1808
02:45:58,258 --> 02:46:03,758
"Unchanging is art and poetry"

1809
02:46:03,842 --> 02:46:10,550
"Undying is intellect and love"

1810
02:46:11,717 --> 02:46:14,925
Is there anything
sadder than immortality?

1811
02:46:15,550 --> 02:46:18,467
Will there be listeners
for an endless tale?
