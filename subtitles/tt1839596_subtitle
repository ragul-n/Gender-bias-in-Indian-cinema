00:01:49,666 --> 00:01:51,082
You know.

3
00:01:54,916 --> 00:01:56,999
Miles away from here.

4
00:01:59,416 --> 00:02:02,082
Beyond good and evil.

5
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:05,707
There's a ground.

6
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,165
l will meet you there.

7
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,624
Often l've wondered

8
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:08,082
You, me, we are all mirrors

9
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:11,624
We catch our reflection in everyone

10
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:14,874
lt's not me, yet l am

11
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:16,624
Right...

12
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:18,165
Wrong...

13
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:21,040
l'm yours

14
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:24,999
To find me

15
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:27,999
ls to find yourself

16
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:31,332
All that l

17
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:34,707
Wish to say

18
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:38,999
ls ruined by

19
00:06:39,291 --> 00:06:44,874
My words

20
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:11,165
Lovely.

21
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:32,790
Often l feel that

22
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,165
This whole world is magic

23
00:07:36,541 --> 00:07:37,874
Which ls

24
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:39,957
And yet ls not

25
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,124
Seasons, clouds, wind, blossoms

26
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:48,999
They send signals to me

27
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:56,082
How do l narrate their tales

28
00:07:57,291 --> 00:07:59,457
All that l

29
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:02,749
Wish to say

30
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:06,790
ls ruined by

31
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:13,749
My words

32
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:19,874
Oh yeah yeah

33
00:08:21,916 --> 00:08:23,082
You want to be a Hero, huh?

34
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:24,665
This looks like a theater to you?

35
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,540
What's the matter, sir? Sir?
- Let go of it!

36
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:28,040
Be careful... the strings...

37
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:29,332
l told you to let go of it!

38
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:31,374
Take care of the strings.

39
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:33,457
Come... l'll make you
perform at the police station.

40
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:34,790
Sir... the strings...

41
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:38,957
Jim Morrison.

42
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:40,290
Who?

43
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,957
He was a great singer.

44
00:08:42,083 --> 00:08:44,457
The chicks would tear their
clothes at the mere sight of him.

45
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:48,874
He stood before the crowd...

46
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:51,415
on the stage...

47
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:53,582
and raised his middle finger.

48
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:54,957
Just like this!

49
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:58,540
And the crowd went wild...

50
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:02,290
they cheered and whistled... as
if he had done something incredible.

51
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:06,874
While here l was,
respectfully singing...

52
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:10,165
so that the people waiting for
the bus would have a good time.

53
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:12,915
And these
no-good-cops began hitting me.

54
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,415
Very sad.

55
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:16,415
l mean, as if l were nothing.

56
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,040
Are you getting the samosas?

57
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:19,540
Right, continue to rip him off!

58
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:22,124
There are a thousand
criminals in Delhi...

59
00:09:22,166 --> 00:09:23,415
the cops should go after them.

60
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,374
Exactly!

61
00:09:24,458 --> 00:09:25,999
Why this poor guy?

62
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:28,124
Jim Morrison...

63
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,874
Janardan Jakhar.

64
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:35,624
JM...

65
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:38,082
JJ.

66
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:47,124
Guys, he's a dead item!

67
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:50,165
And is this the
latest low class fashion?

68
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:53,415
To Be With You...

69
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,040
lead break.

70
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:02,999
Keep some style, dude!

71
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:05,790
Man, you're on stage!

72
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,957
You should have some
stage presence, right?

73
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:09,749
Attitude!

74
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:11,749
Like this...

75
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:13,374
like this!

76
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:15,832
As if you are going
to blow everyone away!

77
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:40,749
What happened?

78
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:42,665
JJ?

79
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:45,040
My days aren't going well...

80
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:48,124
Right now it's just
a few bad days, son.

81
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:52,165
lf you don't stop your
strumming and singing...

82
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:54,832
then just see how your
whole life goes bad.

83
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:56,457
This guy is very negative!

84
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:57,874
You loser!

85
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:01,124
As if he will strike it rich
with his father's business.

86
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:03,332
l will never join
the transport business.

87
00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:04,874
Well then, get your degree and..

88
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:06,540
..become an advocate
at the district court.

89
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:08,332
Trust me, that's the best you can do.

90
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:10,374
So he shouldn't even try?

91
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:11,999
That rules out any
chance he might have.

92
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:14,165
He doesn't stand a chance anyway.

93
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:17,082
You don't become big, just by
striking a pose with a guitar.

94
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:19,499
But he has been playing
the guitar since he was a kid!

95
00:11:19,583 --> 00:11:20,999
Then why hasn't he
tasted success yet?

96
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:22,540
Tell me.

97
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:25,374
You mean...
- Because he doesn't have it in him.

98
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:27,540
He doesn't have that quality.

99
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:30,124
And what kind of friends are you?

100
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,165
Just to eat the samosas he pays for?

101
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:34,040
Hey!
- Why don't you explain it to him?

102
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:35,874
The sooner he understands,
the better it is.
