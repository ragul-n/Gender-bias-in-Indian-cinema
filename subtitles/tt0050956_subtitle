1
00:02:39,425 --> 00:02:41,052
Shekhar sir, I'm really
surprised,

2
00:02:41,261 --> 00:02:45,721
Such a small girl and such good
pronunciation of Sanskrit.

3
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:49,235
Not only this, she remembers
the entire Gita.

4
00:02:49,435 --> 00:02:51,733
I see... I've heard from
people saying,

5
00:02:51,938 --> 00:02:54,566
That the great soul which had
left your house,

6
00:02:54,974 --> 00:02:57,067
It has come back in the
form of this girl.

7
00:02:57,277 --> 00:03:00,906
Shekhar sir, I've also heard that, there's
a complete story behind this.

8
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:04,947
Yes... my life story.

9
00:03:05,718 --> 00:03:07,015
Can I hear that?

10
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:12,091
Listen...

11
00:03:14,294 --> 00:03:15,420
It's an incident of many years back,

12
00:03:16,796 --> 00:03:19,765
One day, I along with my friends,
had gone on a pleasure trip.

13
00:03:20,967 --> 00:03:23,094
All of a sudden, one of my
friend fell sick.

14
00:03:24,637 --> 00:03:26,434
We were very far from
the city.

15
00:03:26,973 --> 00:03:28,440
Where could we find
the Doctor?

16
00:03:29,475 --> 00:03:33,605
Then somebody told us that
there's a Nature Clinic nearby.

17
00:03:33,746 --> 00:03:34,713
We took him there.

18
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:38,614
Wow! Nature Clinic...

19
00:03:39,352 --> 00:03:42,981
That's it, leave me alone in
the shelter of Nature Clinic.

20
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:47,120
You all go... I don't need
you people,

21
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:50,956
Again the same book? The secret
to live for 100 years.

22
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:53,199
Hey stupid, if you continue
doing this,

23
00:03:53,499 --> 00:03:55,126
Not for 100 yrs, but you'll not be
able to live even for 100 days.

24
00:03:55,768 --> 00:04:04,039
The one who is present in the
entire universe,

25
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:27,660
Who lights the entire universe
with his power,

26
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:40,001
Virtue personified.

27
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:54,683
Omnipotent Lord Ram.

28
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:04,196
He who provides benevolence
and happiness to all.

29
00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:16,544
Oh Lord Ram!

30
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:25,051
Lord Ram and Goddess Sita,
we are under your shelter.

31
00:05:49,782 --> 00:05:57,587
The essence of all the religions,
is Lord Ram.

32
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:01,590
Lord Ram...

33
00:06:05,965 --> 00:06:13,599
Only this Lord Ram can
fructify our lives.

34
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:22,112
The only truth is Lord Ram.

35
00:07:06,859 --> 00:07:09,657
Everybody chant, Lord Ram... - Hail...

36
00:07:11,531 --> 00:07:18,266
Oh Lord Ram, you're the
benefactor of sinners.

37
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:29,513
Oh God! May you ward off
the evil eye.

38
00:07:29,715 --> 00:07:31,342
Oh mother, my ear...

39
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:33,585
Pull it... pull it from
the root.

40
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,947
But mother, I'll not
come back home.

41
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:38,487
Hey, son of a mother, I'm not
your mother, I'm Shekhar.

42
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:42,454
Yuck... I was almost dead,
Oh God...

43
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:45,898
I see, you've run away from home
and you've camped yourself here.

44
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:47,199
Friend, what else could I do?

45
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,028
You very well know mother's language,
it runs like a scissor.

46
00:07:50,736 --> 00:07:54,194
But sir, how come you're here?

47
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:58,408
One of my friend fell sick.
So we brought him here for treatment.

48
00:07:58,678 --> 00:07:59,645
Everybody is standing at the gate.

49
00:08:00,179 --> 00:08:02,773
Look, the teacher lives
in that cottage.

50
00:08:03,182 --> 00:08:05,309
The disease disappears at the
touch of his hands.

51
00:08:05,618 --> 00:08:09,213
And Sharda Devi stays in
this cottage.

52
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:11,049
One glance and the disease
disappears.

53
00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:13,555
You do one thing, you go
to Sharda Devi.

54
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:17,718
And I'll go and bring the teacher.
Wait, there's a small confusion.

55
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:20,826
You go and bring the teacher
and I'll go to Sharda Devi.

56
00:08:21,767 --> 00:08:23,894
Hey, No. You go to...

57
00:08:24,036 --> 00:08:24,768
Stop blabbering, what's this
nonsense?

58
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:26,567
Sometimes you say go here
and sometimes you say go there.

59
00:08:26,772 --> 00:08:27,898
And outside, the death is
awaiting my friend.

60
00:08:28,107 --> 00:08:28,807
Death...

61
00:08:30,443 --> 00:08:35,346
Brother, this is a Nature Clinic, meaning
a hospital for Natural treatment.

62
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:37,312
How dare death come here.

63
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:38,484
Will you call madam?

64
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:42,319
Are you hard of hearing?
I want to meet madam.

65
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:46,423
She is dumb also...

66
00:08:47,293 --> 00:08:47,993
Madam...

67
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:49,086
Tell me, what do you want
to say?

68
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:52,093
Oh I see! So you talk.

69
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:58,526
Listen, where's that elderly
Devi, Sharda Devi?

70
00:08:58,871 --> 00:08:59,929
I'm only Sharda.

71
00:09:00,973 --> 00:09:05,603
What... you are
Sharda Devi?

72
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:07,672
Forgive me, I couldn't recognise you.

73
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:09,476
Greetings...

74
00:09:09,815 --> 00:09:13,273
Actually, the thing is that all of
a sudden, my friend has fallen sick.

75
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:15,450
You come and see him.
He is at the gate.

76
00:09:24,163 --> 00:09:26,290
Just look at me and forget
the pain.

77
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:28,126
And quickly answer all
my questions.

78
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,798
Tell me, what's your name?
- Badnam (characterless)

79
00:09:33,005 --> 00:09:35,132
That's very much obvious
from your face.

80
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:39,467
Then my dear, why do you ask?
- His name is Mohan.

81
00:09:40,012 --> 00:09:45,143
Wow, Mohan, being so intelligent, you
started shouting like small children?

82
00:09:45,685 --> 00:09:48,313
My dear, the secret of life
lies only in this.

83
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:51,489
Okay, I've lost.

84
00:09:52,124 --> 00:09:53,318
Look, even the teacher
has come.

85
00:09:56,729 --> 00:09:57,661
Son, don't worry.

86
00:09:58,197 --> 00:10:03,499
Teacher, don't tell this to me. Tell these
stupid people, they're getting worried.

87
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:05,499
Keep quiet. - Alright... alright.

88
00:10:10,376 --> 00:10:14,836
Son, you have this disease for the
last 5 years, Isn't it? - Yes.

89
00:10:15,047 --> 00:10:19,006
And you get this attack every month
on the full moon day, Isn't it?

90
00:10:19,218 --> 00:10:21,846
Great, Teacher, you're
really great!

91
00:10:22,221 --> 00:10:26,021
Then son, why do you drink
so much of liquor?

92
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,860
Teacher, Old habits die hard.

93
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:34,199
You get water heated for formotation.
- Alright.

94
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,699
And Sharda my child, make
arrangements for the treatment.

95
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:50,545
The patient will have to stay
here for few days.

96
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:54,047
You all can go. Just one person
is more than enough.

97
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,720
Alright, greetings...
- Greetings...

98
00:10:58,924 --> 00:11:02,382
Look, you all go, I'll stay
with Mohan.

99
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:14,065
Mohan, has the pain reduced
a little bit?

100
00:11:14,273 --> 00:11:15,900
My dear, what difference
does it make?

101
00:11:16,108 --> 00:11:17,575
First I was sad that there
is pain.

102
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:19,402
And now, I'm sad that
there's no pain.

103
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:22,911
Dinesh, tell him that it's prohibited
to talk to the patient.

104
00:11:23,115 --> 00:11:26,107
Did you hear, it's prohibited to
talk to the patient over here.

105
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:35,753
Excuse me, how did this disease
subside so soon?

106
00:11:37,897 --> 00:11:41,094
Is this the magic of this
medicine or of your hands?

107
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,601
It's prohibited to smoke here.

108
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,748
Smoking cigarette is prohibited here.

109
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:04,554
What?

110
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,448
Smoking cigarette is prohibited here

111
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:07,359
Why?

112
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,686
It's the rule of this clinic.

113
00:12:09,261 --> 00:12:11,491
This is my rule.

114
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:21,740
What's this?

115
00:12:22,007 --> 00:12:23,031
This is a cigarette.

116
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:24,539
And it's prohibited to
smoke here.

117
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:25,574
I know.

118
00:12:26,345 --> 00:12:27,812
Taking to a patient is prohibited
over here

119
00:12:28,013 --> 00:12:29,002
Smoking a cigarette is prohibited
over here.

120
00:12:30,349 --> 00:12:33,978
But madam, Is it not prohibited
to throw mud on a decent man?

121
00:12:34,186 --> 00:12:36,313
What impertinence is this? You
put mud on my face, yuck...

122
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:37,489
What a strange thing it is!

123
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:39,155
Speaking without knowing
the qualities of mud.

124
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:42,188
You should be hating cigarettes
and all other things.

125
00:12:42,394 --> 00:12:45,329
The mud gives us birth.
It gives us food for our existence.

126
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:48,500
And this is this mud, which has just
now saved your friend's life.

127
00:12:48,834 --> 00:12:50,495
Whether you agree to this
fact or not,

128
00:12:50,836 --> 00:12:54,567
Till the time you are here, you'll have
to abide by the rules of this hermitage.

129
00:13:02,815 --> 00:13:03,679
What's all this?

130
00:13:04,016 --> 00:13:06,849
Nothing madam...

131
00:13:07,319 --> 00:13:08,019
Take this juice.

132
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:09,216
Juice?

133
00:13:09,421 --> 00:13:10,217
Lemon juice.

134
00:13:11,323 --> 00:13:12,051
Why?

135
00:13:12,858 --> 00:13:16,294
Madam, don't we get some other
juice in your hermitage?

136
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:22,894
I mean grape juice, I mean
to say, liquor...

137
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:26,732
Look, If your life is dear to you,

138
00:13:27,006 --> 00:13:29,566
Don't drink liquor even after
you go from here.

139
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:32,000
But only if my life is dear
to me, Isn't it?

140
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:35,004
Anyway give me the juice.

141
00:13:37,917 --> 00:13:43,378
...Bring those plates over here.

142
00:13:46,592 --> 00:13:49,561
...Did Mr. Shekhar's feelings got
hurt because of my talk?

143
00:13:53,265 --> 00:13:54,232
What else could I do?

144
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:57,065
When I told him that there are
a few rules of the clinic.

145
00:13:57,269 --> 00:13:58,736
Then he should've have abided by
those rules, Isn't it?

146
00:13:58,938 --> 00:13:59,734
Absolutely.

147
00:14:02,107 --> 00:14:04,405
But Rod is the logic of fools
Isn't it?

148
00:14:05,945 --> 00:14:07,242
Forgive me. Take this...

149
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,748
You very well know to deceive
people, go from here.

150
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:11,907
Look, you tell me whatever
you want.

151
00:14:12,117 --> 00:14:13,584
But don't ask me to go
from here.

152
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:16,078
I too want to serve people
along with you.

153
00:14:16,455 --> 00:14:17,422
Should I keep plates
over there?

154
00:14:19,124 --> 00:14:19,824
Thank you!

155
00:14:22,461 --> 00:14:23,428
Now give me some other work.

156
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:25,423
Tell me, should I help you
in cutting vegetables?

157
00:14:25,798 --> 00:14:26,765
This is not your work.

158
00:14:26,966 --> 00:14:28,763
Hey, you still don't know, how
professional I am?

159
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:39,602
Did you see, I've done a work
of hours in minutes.

160
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,180
What happened?

161
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:44,783
It happened.

162
00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:48,116
Your activities are absolutely childish!

163
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:04,132
Should I ask you one thing?
Has your marriage taken place?

164
00:15:06,138 --> 00:15:09,301
Madam...? Bandage...

165
00:15:16,181 --> 00:15:18,308
Why do you get angry? I had
asked just like that.

166
00:15:18,517 --> 00:15:20,644
Actually, I knew, I saw your
parting and understood.

167
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:21,979
That your marriage has not
taken place.

168
00:15:22,187 --> 00:15:22,887
What do you say?

169
00:15:23,522 --> 00:15:25,990
I say all this is waste.
- My asking you or your marrying?

170
00:15:26,191 --> 00:15:26,891
Both.

171
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:30,488
Look... Bandage...

172
00:15:32,865 --> 00:15:33,991
You don't get angry...

173
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,326
Should I ask you one
more thing?

174
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:39,663
Will you remain a spinster throughout
your life. - Yes

175
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:42,339
It's a noble idea, I've a
similar idea.

176
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:44,668
Surprising! Both of us think alike.

177
00:15:48,547 --> 00:15:50,014
Any other service for me?
- Yes

178
00:15:50,215 --> 00:15:51,614
Tell me, I'll execute it in a jiffy.

179
00:15:52,217 --> 00:15:53,514
You go away from here quietly.

180
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:57,416
Okay... no... Tell me to do
something else.

181
00:15:58,557 --> 00:16:03,187
See, It is paining a lot.
- Pour water on it.

182
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:06,190
Water! Hot or Cold?

183
00:16:08,233 --> 00:16:10,701
Mr. Accountant, any news of
Chiranjeev?

184
00:16:10,903 --> 00:16:13,701
My shoes have become
slippers in his search.

185
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:16,704
I've lost my voice, by
persistent enquiries.

186
00:16:17,042 --> 00:16:19,772
You idiot, no one knows him as
Chiranjeev.

187
00:16:20,245 --> 00:16:21,542
You should have asked for Shekhar.

188
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:23,711
I did that too boss...

189
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:26,544
But both Chiranjeev and Shekhar
couldn't be traced.

190
00:16:27,586 --> 00:16:29,053
You've become very clever.

191
00:16:29,588 --> 00:16:31,556
No doubt boss... - Idiot

192
00:16:32,925 --> 00:16:34,222
No doubt boss.

193
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:35,653
Go and do your work.

194
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:37,392
Greetings boss.

195
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,661
Greetings...

196
00:16:39,932 --> 00:16:41,399
Come Ramsaran, sit down.

197
00:16:42,935 --> 00:16:43,799
What brought you here?

198
00:16:44,603 --> 00:16:49,563
You know it boss. Floods've ruined
the crop this year.

199
00:16:50,275 --> 00:16:52,072
I couldn't bring the entire
Land Tax.

200
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:57,247
Out of 2000, 1500 rupees.

201
00:16:57,449 --> 00:16:58,916
Balance?
- Next crop.

202
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:01,086
Next crop? How is it possible?

203
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,250
Isn't it Mr. Accountant?
- Yes boss, how is it possible?

204
00:17:04,623 --> 00:17:05,920
How is it possible?!

205
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:08,751
You idiot, his entire crop is ruined.

206
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:10,428
How'll he pay the entire amount?

207
00:17:10,629 --> 00:17:12,597
Yes boss, how'll he pay?

208
00:17:12,965 --> 00:17:16,162
Keep the money, debit Rs. 1000
and return Rs. 500/-

209
00:17:16,969 --> 00:17:17,669
Yes sir.

210
00:17:19,304 --> 00:17:21,101
Worship...

211
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:29,445
Oh my mind! Worship love...

212
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:32,447
Worship...

213
00:17:35,821 --> 00:17:42,283
Worship... oh Goddess, worship
is pagoda worship.

214
00:17:42,995 --> 00:17:45,293
Worship...

215
00:17:57,342 --> 00:18:13,122
There is no friend better than love.
There is no modus for love...

216
00:18:14,526 --> 00:18:17,984
Renounce the world and become
a hermit.

217
00:18:18,697 --> 00:18:24,658
Renounce the world and become
a ascetic, wear a shawl.

218
00:18:27,206 --> 00:18:29,504
Worship...

219
00:18:52,898 --> 00:19:08,713
Become the inhabitant of the city of love,
drown in this ocean and get lost.

220
00:19:09,915 --> 00:19:14,875
If your devotion is true,
maiden will appear.

221
00:19:15,254 --> 00:19:17,882
Oh! Maiden'll appear.

222
00:19:18,423 --> 00:19:23,383
Worship love... worship...

223
00:19:48,287 --> 00:20:03,931
Smear ashes on you ascetic. Why'll the
female ascetic be yours?

224
00:20:05,304 --> 00:20:14,576
She'll fill your empty life with her love...
and fill it with light.

225
00:20:30,162 --> 00:20:31,129
What's all this happening?

226
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:35,963
Worship? Worship of love.

227
00:20:36,335 --> 00:20:37,802
But this is a Temple of God.

228
00:20:38,837 --> 00:20:41,305
Whatever it may be, but my Goddess
gave me a glimpse here only.

229
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:42,638
Then, have her glimpse.

230
00:20:42,841 --> 00:20:43,808
Wait wait...

231
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:44,976
Where are you going?

232
00:20:45,143 --> 00:20:46,508
Why should I come between
you and your Goddess?

233
00:20:46,678 --> 00:20:49,647
Wait wait. For me both
are one and same.

234
00:20:49,848 --> 00:20:51,975
You appear like Goddess to me and
Goddess appears like you.

235
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:53,651
For me, you're my Goddess
and Goddess is you.

236
00:20:54,853 --> 00:20:58,482
Wait wait. Listen... I want
to say something to you.

237
00:21:00,525 --> 00:21:02,493
Why do you look at me like that?
Please don't look at me like that.

238
00:21:02,694 --> 00:21:03,661
I'm scared.

239
00:21:03,862 --> 00:21:06,160
Oh! Why do you talk like
a small boy?

240
00:21:06,365 --> 00:21:07,662
Am I talking like a small boy?

241
00:21:07,866 --> 00:21:09,663
Me? I'm a small boy!

242
00:21:10,035 --> 00:21:11,662
Please listen... listen.

243
00:21:12,537 --> 00:21:13,834
I want to say something
with you.

244
00:21:14,206 --> 00:21:15,833
What was that I wanted to tell you?
I've forgotten it.

245
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:16,837
Now, I remember it.

246
00:21:17,209 --> 00:21:17,909
Listen!

247
00:21:18,543 --> 00:21:19,840
Tonight, I'm leaving for my home.

248
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:21,008
Go!

249
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:22,080
Go?!

250
00:21:22,381 --> 00:21:23,177
That's all.

251
00:21:24,383 --> 00:21:26,351
At least for fun, you could've asked me
to stay back for few more days.

252
00:21:26,885 --> 00:21:27,681
Okay, leave it.

253
00:21:27,886 --> 00:21:30,184
Actually the matter is, that I
may've to go to foreign.

254
00:21:30,389 --> 00:21:32,357
China!
- China? Why?

255
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,025
A Cultural Delegation is going
there and I...

256
00:21:36,228 --> 00:21:38,856
Okay, listen before going there
I'll come to meet you.

257
00:21:39,164 --> 00:21:41,257
To meet me? Why?

258
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:46,569
That... I too don't know.

259
00:21:59,217 --> 00:22:01,515
Mother, may I tell you onething.

260
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:03,549
There's a girl,

261
00:22:04,423 --> 00:22:07,119
Don't know why, but whenever
I see her...

262
00:22:08,427 --> 00:22:09,724
I always find you in her.

263
00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:13,227
I love... I...

264
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:15,727
Now, I'm unable to understand,
this also.

265
00:22:15,934 --> 00:22:17,231
Whether I should proceed to
China or cancel it?

266
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:19,561
Oh! Chiranjeev is present here.

267
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,907
Son, are you talking with mother?

268
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:24,542
Yes!

269
00:22:25,277 --> 00:22:30,408
Son, Hukundas feels that it'll be better, if
you get married before going to China.

270
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:31,549
Marriage?

271
00:22:32,951 --> 00:22:34,248
What's the urgency
for that, father?

272
00:22:34,486 --> 00:22:36,113
Boss, why it's not urgent?

273
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:38,586
If you bring a Chinese Doll
as your wife?

274
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:39,755
You keep quiet.

275
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:43,821
Son, if your mother had been
alive today,

276
00:22:44,229 --> 00:22:46,254
I wouldn't have been burdened
with this auspicious function.

277
00:22:46,965 --> 00:22:50,264
Even she would've suggested a marriage
before you left for China.

278
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:51,433
What's marriage?

279
00:22:51,636 --> 00:22:53,934
A marriage can be performed before going
or after coming from China

280
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:55,605
It can happen any where, any time.

281
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:57,273
Father, marriage is a union, Isn't it?

282
00:22:57,642 --> 00:22:59,610
Okay! I'll visit Hukunchand
and come back.

283
00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:04,408
Listen, marriage can happen
at any place, any time.

284
00:23:04,649 --> 00:23:07,447
Still so enthusiastic about going
to Chanchal's house.

285
00:23:07,652 --> 00:23:09,279
What do you know? Idiot!

286
00:23:10,522 --> 00:23:13,457
Rogue, manner less, get out
from here.

287
00:23:14,326 --> 00:23:15,623
I warn you, go away from here.

288
00:23:15,794 --> 00:23:16,494
Go away.

289
00:23:25,637 --> 00:23:27,628
When did you come?
- Just now.

290
00:23:27,873 --> 00:23:30,808
Look! He brought cold tea.
How can I drink it?

291
00:23:31,009 --> 00:23:31,839
How can you drink it?

292
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:33,839
Rogue, country brute.

293
00:23:34,012 --> 00:23:38,312
Okay tell me, why didn't you come to
my college, to watch my dance?

294
00:23:39,351 --> 00:23:41,319
What can I say, I was not free.

295
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,545
As if I don't know.

296
00:23:44,022 --> 00:23:45,990
How could you get time to
go to the club?

297
00:23:46,691 --> 00:23:50,491
Shekhar, in future, if you do like this
you may've to face my wrath.

298
00:23:50,695 --> 00:23:52,492
I know that.
Can I go now?

299
00:23:52,697 --> 00:23:54,665
No no, you must have your
food here.

300
00:23:54,866 --> 00:23:55,833
No No, I'll come sometime later.

301
00:23:56,034 --> 00:23:57,331
No No, Shekhar. I implore you.

302
00:23:58,403 --> 00:23:59,392
Will you serve me pudding?

303
00:23:59,704 --> 00:24:02,172
I'll have it topped with
almonds also.

304
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:03,835
Then go and get it done quickly.

305
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:04,809
Right away.

306
00:24:13,552 --> 00:24:16,350
Shekhar is here. Today he'll
eat here only.

307
00:24:16,555 --> 00:24:19,183
Prepare pudding immediately topping
it with plenty of Almonds.

308
00:24:19,391 --> 00:24:22,189
Not only almonds, we'll have plenty
of pistachios also.

309
00:24:22,394 --> 00:24:25,522
I want to know, why do you lose
your balance on seeing him?

310
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:28,699
Why not? One day they're going
to get married, isn't it?

311
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:29,867
You shut up!

312
00:24:30,068 --> 00:24:32,536
I don't want to throw my
dear child into that hell.

313
00:24:32,737 --> 00:24:34,864
Till I'm alive, this marriage
is impossible.

314
00:24:35,073 --> 00:24:36,370
Dear, please talk in a low voice!

315
00:24:36,575 --> 00:24:38,372
Then, am I shouting at the
top of my voice?

316
00:24:38,577 --> 00:24:40,875
Always asking me talk in
a low voice.

317
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:42,546
You're trying to dominate me.

318
00:24:42,747 --> 00:24:44,544
Mother, you are also too much.

319
00:24:58,597 --> 00:25:00,064
Where did Shekhar go?

320
00:25:00,265 --> 00:25:01,061
He gave this letter and went away.

321
00:25:01,266 --> 00:25:02,392
Why did you allow him to go?

322
00:25:02,601 --> 00:25:03,568
Mannerless, rogue.

323
00:25:06,438 --> 00:25:07,564
Gave a letter and slipped away!

324
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,566
Dear - Dear!

325
00:25:09,774 --> 00:25:11,241
Do you've any idea? - No.

326
00:25:11,443 --> 00:25:13,070
Our Ganesh is in the
Nature Cure Hospital.

327
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:13,978
Is it?

328
00:25:14,112 --> 00:25:16,080
Your Shekhar has seen
him there.

329
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:18,148
Is it true? I'll go right now
and bring him back.

330
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:20,576
Going to bring him back? Will you
be able to bring him back?

331
00:25:20,785 --> 00:25:22,582
I'll go -Dear, you don't go there.

332
00:25:22,787 --> 00:25:24,254
He's already very scared of you.

333
00:25:24,623 --> 00:25:26,090
He may run away from there also.

334
00:25:26,291 --> 00:25:28,088
Only if I give him an opportunity
to escape, Isn't it?

335
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:31,087
You go and sit in your corner and
write Lord's Rama's name.

336
00:25:31,897 --> 00:25:36,095
If I find a suitable groom,
then I'll get you married.

337
00:25:36,334 --> 00:25:37,426
What do you say, my child?

338
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:40,428
Why do you ask her Ramsaran?

339
00:25:41,006 --> 00:25:42,769
Did she ever disobey you?

340
00:25:43,475 --> 00:25:45,443
It's all your mercy, Teacher?

341
00:25:46,144 --> 00:25:49,773
You've brought up a
motherless child.

342
00:25:50,315 --> 00:25:51,942
You educated her.

343
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:53,447
Sharda is a woman of great character.

344
00:25:53,652 --> 00:25:56,280
Which ever home she'll go,
they'll be fortunate.

345
00:25:56,488 --> 00:25:58,956
Teacher, someone is here searching
for Ganesh.

346
00:25:59,157 --> 00:26:00,454
I've made them to sit in your room.

347
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:02,957
Go. I'll come behind you,
send Ganesh there.

348
00:26:03,161 --> 00:26:03,957
Yes, sir!

349
00:26:04,162 --> 00:26:07,290
Okay Ramsaran, Greetings.
- Greetings sir

350
00:26:10,335 --> 00:26:12,633
Greetings, sir -Greetings.

351
00:26:12,837 --> 00:26:13,963
Tell me, what has brought you here?

352
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:16,799
Our Junior boss, I mean...

353
00:26:17,008 --> 00:26:19,135
You shut up, Priest.
- I'll talk to him.

354
00:26:19,678 --> 00:26:22,977
Sir! My son Ganesh ran away and
came here.

355
00:26:23,181 --> 00:26:25,479
Without my permission,
why did you admit him here?

356
00:26:25,684 --> 00:26:26,651
Who had admitted him here?

357
00:26:27,018 --> 00:26:28,485
He came here for treatment
on his own.

358
00:26:28,687 --> 00:26:29,387
Came on his own!

359
00:26:29,521 --> 00:26:31,819
Please call him here, I'll ask
him infront of you only.

360
00:26:32,023 --> 00:26:34,651
Sir, Room No. 8 and 9 are vacant.

361
00:26:34,859 --> 00:26:36,827
If you want, you can admit
these two patients there.

362
00:26:37,362 --> 00:26:38,062
Mother!

363
00:26:38,363 --> 00:26:39,063
Mother!

364
00:26:39,364 --> 00:26:41,059
Ganesh, come here.

365
00:26:41,366 --> 00:26:42,333
What's the matter?

366
00:26:42,634 --> 00:26:45,330
Sir, you don't know about
my mother.

367
00:26:45,537 --> 00:26:46,834
She's an incarnation of Goddess Kali.

368
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:47,834
What did you say, fool?

369
00:26:48,039 --> 00:26:48,739
Cool down, madam!

370
00:26:50,208 --> 00:26:52,506
Lying and getting admitted here
is first mistake.

371
00:26:52,877 --> 00:26:55,675
Disobeying your mother is second mistake.

372
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:56,847
Go with her.

373
00:26:57,549 --> 00:27:00,518
Sir, I'm ready to go, but
on one condition.

374
00:27:00,719 --> 00:27:05,019
Tell my mother to stay in this nature cure
center and fast for 21 days.

375
00:27:05,223 --> 00:27:08,522
And eat only fresh vegetables for 6 months,
so that her anger will subside.

376
00:27:08,727 --> 00:27:09,694
Let your enemies fast!

377
00:27:09,894 --> 00:27:11,361
Do I've to die of hunger for you?

378
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:14,190
Wait - Mother, you'll become beautiful.

379
00:27:14,432 --> 00:27:15,194
What? - Wait wait.

380
00:27:16,835 --> 00:27:19,531
Do as I tell you, go with her.

381
00:27:19,838 --> 00:27:22,363
If you want to come back here,
come after getting her permission.

382
00:27:23,074 --> 00:27:25,872
Sir, please listen to me
listen to me sir... sir...

383
00:27:26,077 --> 00:27:27,203
Where are you going?

384
00:27:27,412 --> 00:27:28,112
Leave, mother.

385
00:27:28,346 --> 00:27:30,541
I'll not leave. I'll not leave even
if you were to die - Mother.

386
00:27:30,749 --> 00:27:31,545
You come home with me.

387
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:33,718
My home was that drama stage only.

388
00:27:33,918 --> 00:27:34,714
My clothes!

389
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:36,386
Oh my mother!

390
00:27:36,588 --> 00:27:37,714
Scorpion! Scorpion!

391
00:27:38,423 --> 00:27:39,123
Scorpion!

392
00:27:39,758 --> 00:27:42,226
Oh! Do you want to fool
and escape from me?

393
00:27:42,427 --> 00:27:43,894
Where will you escape from me?

394
00:27:44,095 --> 00:27:44,891
Priest, catch him!

395
00:27:46,264 --> 00:27:47,891
Junior Boss come here!

396
00:27:48,433 --> 00:27:53,894
Junior boss, junior boss - Catch him.

397
00:27:54,606 --> 00:27:57,234
Junior boss, junior boss.

398
00:28:00,278 --> 00:28:01,905
Junior boss! He's jumping over it.

399
00:28:02,113 --> 00:28:04,240
Hey! Go fast and catch him.

400
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:08,252
Fool!

401
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:17,087
Greetings sir! - Greetings!

402
00:28:17,295 --> 00:28:18,628
How are you? - Fine sir.

403
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:19,756
What's all this you've brought?

404
00:28:20,131 --> 00:28:21,098
Sir, I've brought fruits.

405
00:28:21,766 --> 00:28:23,666
Okay, give it to Sharda.

406
00:28:23,968 --> 00:28:24,935
I'll come in a minute.

407
00:28:25,136 --> 00:28:26,398
Come let's go.

408
00:28:31,142 --> 00:28:32,109
When did you come?

409
00:28:33,144 --> 00:28:34,441
Just now!

410
00:28:34,646 --> 00:28:36,614
I was just thinking about you
only and you're here.

411
00:28:37,315 --> 00:28:38,782
Were you thinking about me?

412
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:39,850
Yes!

413
00:28:39,984 --> 00:28:41,952
What to do? I'll always be
thinking about you only.

414
00:28:42,153 --> 00:28:44,621
When I'm awake or sleeping, I'll
be thinking about you only.

415
00:28:44,823 --> 00:28:46,950
If I don't think about you,
I'll become restless.

416
00:28:47,158 --> 00:28:48,955
You only tell me, why do I
feel like that?

417
00:28:51,996 --> 00:28:52,963
How do I know?

418
00:28:53,832 --> 00:28:54,799
Don't you know it?

419
00:28:59,838 --> 00:29:00,805
What's all this?

420
00:29:01,506 --> 00:29:03,303
Fruits.

421
00:29:03,508 --> 00:29:05,976
I've brought them for you
and the master.

422
00:29:06,678 --> 00:29:09,647
I brought them for here. He
told me to give them to you.

423
00:29:10,181 --> 00:29:11,808
Then, I'll take them
- No No No.

424
00:29:12,183 --> 00:29:15,311
Master commanded me to leave them
in your room myself.

425
00:29:15,854 --> 00:29:16,650
You'll pick them?

426
00:29:16,855 --> 00:29:18,482
Yes, it's child's play for me.

427
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:19,816
If you say, I can pick them up with
my small finger.

428
00:29:20,525 --> 00:29:21,225
Pick them up.

429
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:22,059
Okay.

430
00:29:51,055 --> 00:29:52,181
Hands are hurting?

431
00:29:53,725 --> 00:29:54,425
No.

432
00:29:59,731 --> 00:30:01,198
Do you ever speak the truth?

433
00:30:01,666 --> 00:30:03,031
Sometimes.

434
00:30:03,234 --> 00:30:06,362
I've never heard, just now you spoke
such a big lie.

435
00:30:06,704 --> 00:30:07,534
Which one?

436
00:30:07,739 --> 00:30:11,368
That I think about you day and night,
that's not a lie.

437
00:30:11,709 --> 00:30:13,540
I might've lied about hands, but...

438
00:30:13,912 --> 00:30:16,904
It's a matter of heart and it never lies.

439
00:30:17,115 --> 00:30:18,207
Lying is bad in all forms.

440
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:21,576
Alright, from today no lying.
Happy now?

441
00:30:26,624 --> 00:30:27,324
Take this.

442
00:30:31,095 --> 00:30:33,086
I'm very happy today. - Why?

443
00:30:35,433 --> 00:30:36,593
Because, I've seen you.

444
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:40,728
Won't you go to meet your friend?

445
00:30:41,139 --> 00:30:42,538
Him?

446
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:49,610
If you say, then I'll go.

447
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:55,579
Did you call me?

448
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:59,356
What? Yes, distribute this
fruits among patients.

449
00:30:59,424 --> 00:31:00,124
Yes, madam.

450
00:31:03,995 --> 00:31:06,930
Sharda Devi has influenced
you also.

451
00:31:07,632 --> 00:31:08,860
It's not a thing to laugh at, Mohan.

452
00:31:10,001 --> 00:31:11,764
Sharda Devi is really a Goddess.

453
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:14,161
A person can't say no to her
for anything.

454
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,199
Look at me for instance.

455
00:31:16,774 --> 00:31:18,207
Earlier, I gave up smoking.

456
00:31:18,643 --> 00:31:20,406
Now, I've promised her not to lie.

457
00:31:20,612 --> 00:31:22,603
Have you only given promises or
taken some also?

458
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:25,782
You fool, promises are not taken
for Goddess and Gods.

459
00:31:25,984 --> 00:31:29,112
Infront of them, you've to beg
with folded hands and bent heads.

460
00:31:29,287 --> 00:31:31,448
You've no other job except
to praise me.

461
00:31:32,357 --> 00:31:36,487
This... This person... listen
listen...

462
00:31:38,029 --> 00:31:40,691
Shekhar, she is my sister Sundari.

463
00:31:40,999 --> 00:31:41,795
Greetings.

464
00:31:42,667 --> 00:31:45,431
You helped my brother, thanks.

465
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:47,965
You needn't thank me.
It was my duty.

466
00:31:48,172 --> 00:31:51,471
Brother, now that your friend has
also come, why can't we go today itself?

467
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:53,472
Shekhar, what do you say?

468
00:31:53,778 --> 00:31:56,338
I, I'll go tomorrow.

469
00:31:56,981 --> 00:32:00,883
Of course, he won't go.
Brother, we'll go today itself.

470
00:32:34,652 --> 00:32:35,482
Great!

471
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:37,321
You!

472
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:39,184
Yes, I've come again.

473
00:32:39,557 --> 00:32:40,922
The stanza that you sang just now.

474
00:32:41,859 --> 00:32:44,157
I didn't understand its meaning,
please explain.

475
00:32:44,395 --> 00:32:46,863
You are a scholar.

476
00:32:47,065 --> 00:32:48,225
I'm nothing.

477
00:32:48,366 --> 00:32:50,231
Great! I'm nothing.

478
00:32:50,401 --> 00:32:52,426
You're advising others not to tell lies
and you're lying.

479
00:32:53,871 --> 00:32:54,803
Please explain.

480
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,338
Then, listen...

481
00:32:56,674 --> 00:32:59,268
Lord Krishna told Arjun,

482
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:00,804
Hey Arjun...

483
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:05,339
The person who doesn't hate anyone nor
desires anything.

484
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:08,514
He considers sorrows and happiness equally.

485
00:33:08,853 --> 00:33:12,949
Living in the world, doesn't get
bogged down by worldly entanglements.

486
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:17,389
Such person, being a human being is a
true ascetic.

487
00:33:17,929 --> 00:33:19,863
That means a man can get
married.

488
00:33:20,198 --> 00:33:21,460
Yes, why not?

489
00:33:22,734 --> 00:33:24,759
Please tell me, how the girl should be?

490
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:27,968
The girl who knows the obligations
of an Indian woman.

491
00:33:28,439 --> 00:33:31,408
She should be educated, beautiful
and virtuous.

492
00:33:34,612 --> 00:33:36,375
I've searched an exactly
similar girl.

493
00:33:36,948 --> 00:33:38,677
Then, why don't you get married?

494
00:33:41,085 --> 00:33:44,919
I can, but I haven't asked her.

495
00:33:46,391 --> 00:33:47,358
Ask her.

496
00:33:53,231 --> 00:33:54,528
Will you marry me?

497
00:34:09,914 --> 00:34:11,074
Did I make a mistake?

498
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:13,246
No!

499
00:34:18,189 --> 00:34:20,248
Marriage is a matter of fusibility.

500
00:34:20,525 --> 00:34:22,857
It is not the outcome of the
desires of 2 persons.

501
00:34:23,094 --> 00:34:27,258
Then, we've our elders
who've brought us.

502
00:34:27,965 --> 00:34:29,694
We've to take their permission also.

503
00:34:31,135 --> 00:34:33,262
On my return from China
I'll meet your father.

504
00:34:35,206 --> 00:34:36,696
You first go and come.

505
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:39,603
Will you wait for me?

506
00:34:43,881 --> 00:34:45,314
Take this 'Bhagwat Geeta' (Religious book).

507
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:47,949
Always keep it with you.

508
00:34:48,486 --> 00:34:52,855
Read it sometimes, Take care
of yourself.

509
00:34:53,157 --> 00:34:55,284
Don't be naughty like children.

510
00:34:56,527 --> 00:34:57,994
You also take care of yourself.

511
00:34:58,362 --> 00:35:02,230
Always keep smiling like me.

512
00:35:26,557 --> 00:35:34,293
Oh Moon! Wherever he goes...

513
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:38,432
You go with him.

514
00:35:38,669 --> 00:35:42,435
How is he? Where is he?

515
00:35:42,707 --> 00:35:46,973
Bring me his news every night.

516
00:35:58,256 --> 00:36:06,163
If he goes astray,

517
00:36:06,364 --> 00:36:13,964
If he goes astray, show him the path.

518
00:36:14,205 --> 00:36:18,164
He is a stranger in foreign lands.

519
00:36:18,376 --> 00:36:22,142
Take him to his destination.

520
00:36:22,547 --> 00:36:30,249
This is his first trip to an
unknown land.

521
00:36:30,454 --> 00:36:34,686
Bring me his news every night.

522
00:36:34,892 --> 00:36:40,888
Oh Moon! Wherever he goes...
Oh Moon...

523
00:36:50,608 --> 00:36:59,038
Tell him that on my lips...

524
00:37:00,484 --> 00:37:08,357
Tell him that on my lips,
I've withering sighs.

525
00:37:08,659 --> 00:37:12,720
Either it is his path,

526
00:37:12,997 --> 00:37:20,233
Either it is his path,
or it is my expectation.

527
00:37:20,605 --> 00:37:28,637
Perplexed loves has
perplexed story.

528
00:37:28,846 --> 00:37:35,115
Oh Moon! Wherever he goes...
Oh Moon...

529
00:37:48,766 --> 00:38:04,376
Oh Moon, you swear by me.
Don't say anything else.

530
00:38:04,582 --> 00:38:20,158
Tell him that without you here,
It's painful for me to exist.

531
00:38:20,364 --> 00:38:28,271
It is not proper to torture
a tortured person.

532
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:32,306
Bring me his news every night.

533
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:36,776
Oh Moon! Wherever he goes...
Oh Moon...

534
00:39:45,516 --> 00:39:46,278
What happened, boss?

535
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:58,519
What happened father?
- Tell us something boss.

536
00:39:58,729 --> 00:40:00,424
Father - Boss...

537
00:40:15,112 --> 00:40:17,706
Don't cry daughter, don't cry.

538
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:20,607
Whatever had to happen has happened.

539
00:40:20,818 --> 00:40:24,151
How long will you be crying?
- Yes for how long...

540
00:40:24,355 --> 00:40:25,379
Come on, have tea.

541
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:26,487
I won't get up.

542
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:30,655
You're responsible for all this.
Go away from here.

543
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:35,323
My son...

544
00:40:39,003 --> 00:40:40,436
How long can this go
on like this?

545
00:40:40,871 --> 00:40:42,930
You are starving.

546
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:45,131
You are sick, but you're not
taking medicines.

547
00:40:45,509 --> 00:40:48,103
Children are also suffering.
Please take it.

548
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:52,913
Go away, go away.
Doctor leave me alone.

549
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:58,681
Accountant, please come with me.

550
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:06,457
Enough boss. This was fated.

551
00:41:06,697 --> 00:41:08,927
Our continued grief
won't bring him back.

552
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:12,493
Doctor, what's to be done?

553
00:41:12,703 --> 00:41:14,466
Don't let him remain
in that room.

554
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:19,598
Collect all Chiranjeev's things
and lock them in that room.

555
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:21,971
It is very important - Alright, sir.

556
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:43,928
Greetings.

557
00:41:44,401 --> 00:41:45,868
She is my daughter, boss.

558
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:47,765
She gives "Nature cure" treatment
in the hermitage.

559
00:41:47,972 --> 00:41:49,940
Oh! She is also a Doctor.

560
00:41:50,207 --> 00:41:53,267
I'm fed up of doctors,
Take her away, Ramsaran.

561
00:41:53,577 --> 00:41:54,874
I don't want any medicines.

562
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:57,204
But, I treat without medicines.

563
00:41:57,414 --> 00:42:00,008
Without medicines! Heard it
for the 1st time.

564
00:42:00,251 --> 00:42:04,017
Yes, so many patients have been
cured by her with this method.

565
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:07,020
I also want him to be alright.

566
00:42:07,224 --> 00:42:09,055
The sickness which could not be
cured by my medicines...

567
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:10,887
May be it could be cured
by this system.

568
00:42:11,228 --> 00:42:14,595
But doctor, you must come sometimes.

569
00:42:14,798 --> 00:42:17,460
Sure, please come this side.

570
00:42:20,905 --> 00:42:24,466
Listen. He is sick, because his
eldest son has died.

571
00:42:24,675 --> 00:42:28,543
Whenever he sees his photo or his
other things, he starts crying.

572
00:42:28,846 --> 00:42:32,748
That's why, I had locked up all his
photos in that room.

573
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:35,510
Please see that room is
permanently locked up.

574
00:42:35,786 --> 00:42:39,017
Good you told me.
- Greetings!

575
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:43,922
Father, Girish is eating fried puddings.

576
00:42:44,128 --> 00:42:46,722
I'll set right that fool just now.
- You don't get excited, boss.

577
00:42:46,931 --> 00:42:48,523
I'll go and check. Come.

578
00:42:48,899 --> 00:42:53,302
No. He won't listen to you,
I'll set right that fool.

579
00:42:54,772 --> 00:42:57,502
Listen, you're sick, don't eat that.

580
00:42:57,570 --> 00:42:58,270
I'll eat.

581
00:42:58,275 --> 00:43:02,041
Who are you to stop me? Don't come
near me, I'll kill you.

582
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:05,412
You don't go near him.
He really beats.

583
00:43:05,883 --> 00:43:07,942
Doesn't matter.
- Father...

584
00:43:10,387 --> 00:43:13,220
Really? You beat everyone.

585
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:16,885
This is very bad! Good boys don't
behave like this.

586
00:43:17,728 --> 00:43:22,825
You dare like that. I'll thrash
you today.

587
00:43:23,033 --> 00:43:24,125
Please stop him.

588
00:43:24,335 --> 00:43:31,173
Boss... Come... he is a child.
- Nonsense...

589
00:43:33,177 --> 00:43:35,702
Now, you are not angry, isn' it?

590
00:43:35,913 --> 00:43:40,577
If you feel happy by beating,
Here, hit me on this cheek also.

591
00:43:41,585 --> 00:43:42,415
Hit...

592
00:43:44,922 --> 00:43:46,355
You're a nice boy.

593
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:49,457
You've understood very soon,
that you shouldn't beat elders.

594
00:43:50,861 --> 00:43:54,820
Oh! You're having high fever,
Come lie down.

595
00:44:00,871 --> 00:44:04,068
Forgive me, I won't make that
mistake again.

596
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:09,102
I know now you sleep. You'll be
alright in 2 days.

597
00:44:09,513 --> 00:44:12,505
Daughter, come and see
this baby also.

598
00:44:24,194 --> 00:44:25,752
My daughter.

599
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:28,855
She is the younger daughter
of the boss.

600
00:44:29,366 --> 00:44:32,494
Poor thing is dumb from birth and
invalid from childhood.

601
00:44:32,903 --> 00:44:34,200
Just check her, daughter.

602
00:44:40,577 --> 00:44:43,011
Daughter, Can she walk?

603
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:48,141
I'll try father. Naturopathy can cure
many patients.

604
00:46:09,566 --> 00:46:13,002
Priest, I had told you that my son
can't be Bus conductor...

605
00:46:13,203 --> 00:46:14,500
But, you won't listen.

606
00:46:15,105 --> 00:46:17,232
I've seen with my own eyes.

607
00:46:17,441 --> 00:46:20,069
Bullshit, We have checked 3 buses.
Let's go home.

608
00:46:21,845 --> 00:46:25,281
Just wait. We'll check in that bus also.

609
00:46:32,189 --> 00:46:41,962
Come on, come fast...
You don't want to come?

610
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:44,726
Oh Mother you!
- Get down...

611
00:46:47,271 --> 00:46:50,570
When you say "Hold on" Bus stops.
Leave my ear.

612
00:46:50,774 --> 00:46:52,639
Come home quietly.

613
00:46:52,843 --> 00:46:54,902
Why this delay? Is this your
father's bus?

614
00:46:55,112 --> 00:46:57,239
I'll come, don't get angry.

615
00:46:57,447 --> 00:46:59,176
Mother, I'll come home.

616
00:46:59,283 --> 00:47:01,444
Mr. Accountant, you make her
understand.

617
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:04,815
Boss, it is difficult to tell
her to go.

618
00:47:05,022 --> 00:47:06,785
And equally difficult to tell her
not to go.

619
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:08,855
If she goes, this house
will be upset.

620
00:47:09,059 --> 00:47:15,089
If she doesn't go, master will face
hardship, you make her understand.

621
00:47:15,299 --> 00:47:16,891
How can I make her understand?

622
00:47:17,201 --> 00:47:19,294
She isn't unaware of the problems
of our house.

623
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:21,562
If you say, I'll write a letter
to master.

624
00:47:21,772 --> 00:47:24,138
No No, if necessary I'll
come again.

625
00:47:24,441 --> 00:47:26,238
Greetings - Greetings.

626
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:38,917
Hey, why are you crying?

627
00:47:41,191 --> 00:47:43,216
Mother, I'll also come with you.

628
00:47:43,427 --> 00:47:44,257
Mother, take me also.

629
00:47:44,494 --> 00:47:48,089
How can I take you all? You stay here
with your father.

630
00:47:48,432 --> 00:47:49,990
Then, you also stay back mother.
- Yes mother...

631
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:53,795
You had promised that you'll
listen to me.

632
00:47:54,004 --> 00:47:59,670
Listen, I... I'll go and come back.

633
00:47:59,877 --> 00:48:04,337
Now, smile, smile, yes... good girl.

634
00:48:08,585 --> 00:48:12,749
For what all you've done for us,
how can I repay you?

635
00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:17,117
Our baby, whose life was
meaningless...

636
00:48:17,461 --> 00:48:19,224
You've given her a new life.

637
00:48:20,097 --> 00:48:22,964
You've reshaped this house
which was full of problems.

638
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:24,927
I'll never forget your obligation.

639
00:48:25,202 --> 00:48:30,003
It wasn't obligation, I did my duty.
Okay, greetings.

640
00:48:30,841 --> 00:48:31,899
Greetings.

641
00:48:35,679 --> 00:48:39,206
Boss, Ramsaran's daughter is
very good.

642
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:40,576
Yes, Mr. Accountant.

643
00:48:40,784 --> 00:48:42,979
Yes is not enough boss,

644
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:46,280
She should come to this
house permanently.

645
00:48:46,490 --> 00:48:48,014
What are you talking?

646
00:48:48,225 --> 00:48:51,922
You only agree, I'll see
that Ramsaran agrees.

647
00:48:52,129 --> 00:48:52,829
Shut up!

648
00:49:00,003 --> 00:49:02,699
It's my duty to get
boss's consent.

649
00:49:03,273 --> 00:49:07,004
Ramsaran, children consider your
daughter, as their mother.

650
00:49:07,344 --> 00:49:08,971
What are you talking Mr. Accountant?

651
00:49:09,646 --> 00:49:11,546
There is so much disparity between
boss and us.

652
00:49:11,949 --> 00:49:14,008
You don't bother about your
poverty, Ramsaran.

653
00:49:14,651 --> 00:49:16,551
Virtue is far superior to wealth.

654
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:19,753
And Ramsaran, by accepting
this alliance...

655
00:49:19,990 --> 00:49:22,220
You'll save a family from ruination.

656
00:49:22,759 --> 00:49:25,751
Ramsaran, this is your duty also.

657
00:49:26,430 --> 00:49:28,625
Agree, agree, Ramsaran.

658
00:49:30,867 --> 00:49:33,893
Daughter, family is good.

659
00:49:34,104 --> 00:49:36,038
Mr. Kashiram is a very decent person.

660
00:49:36,773 --> 00:49:38,934
Children are very fond of you.

661
00:49:39,509 --> 00:49:43,468
You'll have wealth, respect and prestige.
What else is needed?

662
00:49:44,314 --> 00:49:46,544
And daughter, don't forget...

663
00:49:47,451 --> 00:49:51,820
Our existence today is the result
of their benevolence.

664
00:49:52,622 --> 00:49:57,321
Not only that, you'll resurrect a
family from ruination.

665
00:50:00,297 --> 00:50:02,322
Master, you also say something.

666
00:50:02,733 --> 00:50:05,065
Sharda is sensible herself, Ramsaran.

667
00:50:05,402 --> 00:50:09,839
She knows her duties well, serving
humanity is her duty.

668
00:50:28,392 --> 00:50:36,128
I forbade you to get up, walk etc...

669
00:50:36,533 --> 00:50:38,501
You haven't refrained.

670
00:50:40,470 --> 00:50:42,233
I am tired of lying down.

671
00:50:42,472 --> 00:50:45,236
You see, it's a matter of 8 days only.

672
00:50:45,475 --> 00:50:48,273
One bandage everyday, 8 bandages
for 8 days.

673
00:50:48,645 --> 00:50:52,445
After that get up, sit... walk...

674
00:51:09,499 --> 00:51:11,126
You've given me a new life.

675
00:51:12,669 --> 00:51:14,637
I won't forget your obligation for
the entire life.

676
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:20,970
Humans don't oblige, God obliges.

677
00:51:22,179 --> 00:51:24,807
I must go now. It's
a long journey.

678
00:51:25,515 --> 00:51:28,484
No, don't go today.

679
00:51:29,019 --> 00:51:32,318
Tonight is my son's marriage...

680
00:51:32,689 --> 00:51:35,317
Eating, singing and dancing.

681
00:52:33,583 --> 00:52:34,880
Oh my beautiful lover,
come near me.

682
00:52:35,252 --> 00:52:36,378
Come near me, lover...

683
00:52:36,753 --> 00:52:40,382
Oh my beautiful lover,
come near me.

684
00:52:42,259 --> 00:52:49,062
Oh my beautiful lover, come near me,
your looks have penetrated my heart.

685
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:15,752
By your sweet talk, I fell for you,
you got me easily.

686
00:53:26,303 --> 00:53:29,272
I've realised, love is a
deception...

687
00:53:33,643 --> 00:53:38,945
Love is a torture, your looks have
penetrated...

688
00:54:17,687 --> 00:54:21,316
He deceived me, when I fell
for him.

689
00:54:21,524 --> 00:54:24,652
Heart is not to be blamed, looks
influenced me.

690
00:54:32,035 --> 00:54:36,995
If the looks weren't exchanged,
Love wouldn't have developed.

691
00:54:37,207 --> 00:54:40,005
Why are you avoiding love?

692
00:54:40,210 --> 00:54:43,338
Why did my eyes got entangled
with someone?

693
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:14,039
Smile vanished from my lips.

694
00:55:14,411 --> 00:55:17,539
Why did my heart
reached the low ebb?

695
00:55:28,425 --> 00:55:34,728
All the night I keep awake,
all the day I lie lazily.

696
00:56:25,482 --> 00:56:29,441
Guest is God!
God, bless the couple.

697
00:56:33,990 --> 00:56:37,790
Congratulation! Let God bless
you a happy life.

698
00:56:42,832 --> 00:56:44,459
Are you married?

699
00:56:48,004 --> 00:56:48,704
In the near future.

700
00:56:49,172 --> 00:56:50,469
As soon as I reach home...

701
00:56:52,842 --> 00:56:56,471
Very nice girl like an angel...

702
00:57:13,196 --> 00:57:15,664
Sir, a letter from teacher of
Nature Cure center.

703
00:57:16,032 --> 00:57:19,001
He has invited all of you for the
festival of Ram Navami.

704
00:57:19,869 --> 00:57:21,837
I may not be able
to attend it, Sharda.

705
00:57:22,205 --> 00:57:23,172
You definitely go there.

706
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:26,509
How can I go? It's exams
time for children.

707
00:57:26,709 --> 00:57:28,336
Don't worry about children.

708
00:57:28,711 --> 00:57:31,509
They're grown up! They can look
after themselves.

709
00:57:31,714 --> 00:57:33,000
You must definitely go there.

710
00:57:33,216 --> 00:57:34,012
As you say.

711
00:57:41,057 --> 00:57:43,685
Sir... Sir... Sir...

712
00:57:43,893 --> 00:57:45,019
What's it?
Why're you shouting?

713
00:57:45,228 --> 00:57:47,355
Sir, today I've come to know
about God's presence.

714
00:57:47,564 --> 00:57:49,862
He'll never deceive those
who have profound belief in him.

715
00:57:50,066 --> 00:57:51,533
Tell me exactly what's the matter?

716
00:57:51,734 --> 00:57:53,031
Terrific news, sir.

717
00:57:53,403 --> 00:57:54,370
Junior boss is coming.

718
00:57:54,571 --> 00:57:55,271
What did you say?

719
00:57:55,572 --> 00:57:57,369
My son, you haven't
gone mad, Isn't it?

720
00:57:57,374 --> 00:57:58,074
Mad?

721
00:57:58,241 --> 00:58:00,368
Look at this telegram,
I can go mad.

722
00:58:00,743 --> 00:58:02,870
But postal people won't
go mad, Isn't it?

723
00:58:03,246 --> 00:58:04,213
No No, I've gone mad.

724
00:58:04,414 --> 00:58:05,381
Where's he... Where's he?

725
00:58:05,582 --> 00:58:08,710
In Assam... his plane had been destroyed
completely, but he's alive.

726
00:58:09,586 --> 00:58:10,286
My son!

727
00:58:10,386 --> 00:58:14,686
Mr. Accountant, go and clean Chiranjeev's
room immediately.

728
00:58:14,804 --> 00:58:15,590
And...

729
00:58:15,592 --> 00:58:20,052
I've got it sir, first I'll convey
this good news to madam.

730
00:58:20,263 --> 00:58:22,231
No No, you don't go!

731
00:58:22,765 --> 00:58:26,724
She'll come here by that time,
I'll break this good news to her.

732
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:32,567
Hey! Bhiku... Wait wait.

733
00:58:33,776 --> 00:58:34,476
Listen Bhiku.

734
00:58:35,111 --> 00:58:35,907
Greetings Mr. Shekhar.

735
00:58:36,279 --> 00:58:36,979
When did you come?

736
00:58:37,113 --> 00:58:37,813
Just now!

737
00:58:38,114 --> 00:58:39,741
Bhiku, where's Sharda?

738
00:58:39,949 --> 00:58:42,417
She's in the temple. She came yesterday
only from her in-law's place.

739
00:58:49,626 --> 00:58:50,593
From her in-law's place!

740
00:58:50,793 --> 00:58:51,589
Yes, Mr. Shekhar.

741
00:58:51,794 --> 00:58:53,421
Sharda's luck has smiled.

742
00:58:54,130 --> 00:58:58,590
Bungalows, buildings, wealth,
they've in plenty.

743
00:58:58,968 --> 00:59:00,435
She had been married in
a very rich family.

744
00:59:21,157 --> 00:59:23,125
Sister, please distribute this
God's offerings to everyone.

745
00:59:47,350 --> 00:59:51,650
Lord! Storms are blowing up
in my life.

746
00:59:52,689 --> 00:59:56,648
Give me strength, my Lord! Give me strength
to with stand those storms.

747
01:00:12,208 --> 01:00:16,838
How happy I'm shekhar, you've come
back alive by God's grace.

748
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:19,507
It would've been better
if I had died.

749
01:00:19,882 --> 01:00:22,680
Don't say like that Shekhar,
don't say like that.

750
01:00:23,052 --> 01:00:25,020
What else can I say?
Congratulate you?

751
01:00:25,722 --> 01:00:27,519
That I'm very happy on seeing
you married.

752
01:00:28,391 --> 01:00:30,484
Couldn't you wait for few days?

753
01:00:31,060 --> 01:00:32,186
Were you so interested in
becoming a bride?

754
01:00:35,231 --> 01:00:37,199
What have you done?

755
01:00:38,401 --> 01:00:40,369
Why did you do it?
Why did you do like this?

756
01:00:40,570 --> 01:00:42,367
I've responded to the call
of my prime duty.

757
01:00:43,239 --> 01:00:45,366
To respond to your duty, did you've
to sacrifice my love?

758
01:00:48,244 --> 01:00:49,871
Hearing the news of your death,

759
01:00:50,913 --> 01:00:52,881
I did what my father had
asked me to do.

760
01:00:53,916 --> 01:00:55,713
But how could you believe that
I'm dead?

761
01:00:56,085 --> 01:00:58,212
How could you find out that
your Love is dead?

762
01:00:58,755 --> 01:00:59,881
Didn't you love me?

763
01:01:00,256 --> 01:01:01,223
I did!

764
01:01:01,758 --> 01:01:02,725
Don't you love me now?

765
01:01:03,259 --> 01:01:04,226
I do still love you.

766
01:01:04,761 --> 01:01:05,728
Then, what's all this?

767
01:01:05,928 --> 01:01:09,386
All these symbols of a
married woman?

768
01:01:09,932 --> 01:01:10,899
My duty!

769
01:01:11,100 --> 01:01:11,800
Duty!

770
01:01:12,101 --> 01:01:13,227
And your love?

771
01:01:13,770 --> 01:01:14,470
Love?

772
01:01:16,105 --> 01:01:19,563
It isn't compulsory that one gets married
to the one whom she loves.

773
01:01:20,777 --> 01:01:26,738
We love even our mother,
father and children... God also.

774
01:01:27,950 --> 01:01:29,247
Love is not selfish.

775
01:01:29,786 --> 01:01:30,753
It is sacrifice.

776
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:32,087
And marriage?

777
01:01:33,790 --> 01:01:34,757
It's a union.

778
01:01:35,958 --> 01:01:38,256
Who can refuse a union?

779
01:01:40,463 --> 01:01:42,931
It's good for you also to marry
and forget about me.

780
01:01:44,133 --> 01:01:45,100
Forget you?

781
01:01:52,308 --> 01:01:53,935
Should I forget that we
had met...

782
01:01:55,144 --> 01:01:56,611
Met and became" made
for each other"?

783
01:01:58,815 --> 01:02:00,612
Should I forget that I loved you?

784
01:02:02,151 --> 01:02:05,120
Should I forget that I liked you?
I've understood you.

785
01:02:12,495 --> 01:02:15,464
This can't happen, this
can't happen.

786
01:02:16,499 --> 01:02:17,466
You can forget me.

787
01:02:19,669 --> 01:02:20,636
But I can't forget you.

788
01:02:22,839 --> 01:02:26,798
Shekhar, don't poison your
life like this.

789
01:02:31,514 --> 01:02:35,473
Not only my life, I'll poison
your life also.

790
01:02:37,019 --> 01:02:37,986
You had ruined me.

791
01:02:39,689 --> 01:02:40,815
I'll ruin you.

792
01:02:43,359 --> 01:02:49,662
Wherever you may go, my failed love
will follow you like a shadow.

793
01:02:51,033 --> 01:02:52,330
With my destruction...

794
01:02:53,369 --> 01:02:54,996
Even that home will also
get ruined.

795
01:02:56,038 --> 01:02:59,496
Where a heartless man has lighted
lamps, with the blood of my love.

796
01:02:59,709 --> 01:03:04,009
Abuse me, but
don't abuse my husband.

797
01:03:04,213 --> 01:03:08,172
Husband? He's not a husband,
he's a killer.

798
01:03:08,384 --> 01:03:10,352
No No, he's my God.

799
01:03:10,553 --> 01:03:12,180
He's not a God...
He's a Demon.

800
01:03:12,388 --> 01:03:17,519
Promise on God, please
don't abuse my husband.

801
01:03:17,727 --> 01:03:21,356
Husband... Husband...
Husband...

802
01:03:21,898 --> 01:03:23,525
Your husband will be like
you only.

803
01:03:23,733 --> 01:03:25,030
No No...

804
01:03:25,401 --> 01:03:31,533
Don't abuse my husband...

805
01:03:33,910 --> 01:03:35,537
Your husband is a cheat.

806
01:03:36,245 --> 01:03:37,041
Deceiver!

807
01:03:37,413 --> 01:03:39,381
Rogue... Conman...

808
01:04:03,272 --> 01:04:09,734
By abusing a husband, you've thrown a
challenge to the Indian womanhood.

809
01:04:11,447 --> 01:04:14,416
Please forgive me...
Forgive me.

810
01:04:45,314 --> 01:04:52,117
My dear, my heart is surging...

811
01:04:52,989 --> 01:04:56,618
My heart got entangled...

812
01:04:56,993 --> 01:05:04,297
The shying moments have come...
Blushing moments have come.

813
01:05:08,504 --> 01:05:12,133
My love, now I'll take
a promise from you.

814
01:05:12,341 --> 01:05:19,645
Don't talk about leaving
me anymore.

815
01:05:27,690 --> 01:05:37,326
You used to come into
my dreams regularly.

816
01:05:37,533 --> 01:05:46,999
Why were you coming and
going away?

817
01:05:47,543 --> 01:05:58,681
I've understood. I've found out
that style was to agitate me.

818
01:06:12,735 --> 01:06:22,201
When separated lovers unite,

819
01:06:22,411 --> 01:06:28,043
Then all the grievances will disappear.

820
01:06:36,425 --> 01:06:40,054
Why should I love you?

821
01:06:40,262 --> 01:06:47,395
These are not the matters to
be explained.

822
01:06:55,444 --> 01:07:05,080
Loneliness has left after
feeling shy.

823
01:07:05,287 --> 01:07:14,594
When will the wedding bells
ring now?

824
01:07:14,964 --> 01:07:26,432
These eyes bow and break the
news of your arrival, my lover.

825
01:07:47,496 --> 01:07:52,126
Hey... My play... my play...
leave it... leave it.

826
01:07:56,505 --> 01:07:57,802
Okay pinch me...
Pinch me.

827
01:07:58,007 --> 01:07:59,634
Pinch me to your
heart's content.

828
01:07:59,842 --> 01:08:01,810
Let Shekhar marry you.

829
01:08:02,011 --> 01:08:03,308
If I don't tell him and make him
to pull up your ears,

830
01:08:03,512 --> 01:08:04,308
My name henceforth shall
not be Ganesh.

831
01:08:04,513 --> 01:08:06,310
Is it? - Yes!

832
01:08:06,515 --> 01:08:07,311
Then, watch out.

833
01:08:09,185 --> 01:08:10,652
Don't call mother.

834
01:08:10,853 --> 01:08:13,651
Otherwise she'll come rolling
out like frontier mail.

835
01:08:13,856 --> 01:08:16,654
What did you say? Is mother
a frontier mail?

836
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:22,330
For God's sake, don't call mother.

837
01:08:22,531 --> 01:08:23,231
What's it?

838
01:08:23,365 --> 01:08:24,065
Who's that?

839
01:08:24,366 --> 01:08:25,162
Oh God, mother.

840
01:08:29,538 --> 01:08:30,835
Hey! Why're you troubling her?

841
01:08:31,373 --> 01:08:33,841
Brother was saying...
Brother was saying...

842
01:08:34,210 --> 01:08:35,336
Brother troubles me a lot.

843
01:08:35,544 --> 01:08:36,841
That's all mother...
That's all.

844
01:08:37,713 --> 01:08:41,171
No, brother was saying that
you're... you're...

845
01:08:41,383 --> 01:08:43,010
Enough! Enough! That's all mother.
... That's all.

846
01:08:43,219 --> 01:08:44,686
Hey! What's all this?
That much and this much only?

847
01:08:44,887 --> 01:08:46,184
Don't you've any other work?

848
01:08:46,388 --> 01:08:47,088
What did you say?

849
01:08:47,723 --> 01:08:49,190
Don't I've any other work?

850
01:08:49,558 --> 01:08:52,186
Oh! God... Oh! God! What is this
I'm hearing?

851
01:08:52,394 --> 01:08:53,361
What is this I'm hearing?

852
01:08:53,729 --> 01:08:55,697
Hey, what's all this drama
you are playing?

853
01:08:55,898 --> 01:08:59,197
Drama... my drama is ready
with this song.

854
01:08:59,401 --> 01:09:00,868
And the title is
"Reforming the home"?

855
01:09:01,237 --> 01:09:03,205
One show is enough, mother.
Only one show is enough.

856
01:09:03,405 --> 01:09:07,364
Goat will become Lion
and Lion will become Goat.

857
01:09:07,576 --> 01:09:09,874
And you'll always remain a Donkey.

858
01:09:11,580 --> 01:09:13,207
A telegram has come.

859
01:09:13,415 --> 01:09:15,212
My Chiranjeev will be
here any moment.

860
01:09:15,417 --> 01:09:18,215
After a long period, I've opened
and cleaned his room.

861
01:09:18,420 --> 01:09:19,546
Come and have a look, come.

862
01:09:19,755 --> 01:09:22,553
Sir, ever since madam stepped
into this house,

863
01:09:22,758 --> 01:09:24,055
This house has become
very lucky.

864
01:09:24,260 --> 01:09:24,960
You shut up!

865
01:09:25,261 --> 01:09:28,389
Don't you know that madam
doesn't like praise?

866
01:09:28,597 --> 01:09:29,723
Go and bring children.

867
01:09:29,932 --> 01:09:30,632
Come, Sharda... Come!

868
01:09:35,604 --> 01:09:37,731
You never had an opportunity
to see this room.

869
01:09:38,107 --> 01:09:40,234
Let the man who resided here come,
then watch out it's splendor.

870
01:09:41,443 --> 01:09:42,740
And he's our Chiranjeev.

871
01:09:49,618 --> 01:09:51,586
Yes Yes, Chiranjeev, my son!

872
01:09:52,121 --> 01:09:52,917
Your son?

873
01:09:53,455 --> 01:09:54,922
By the way his name is Shekhar.

874
01:09:55,291 --> 01:09:57,418
But I fondly call him as Chiranjeev.

875
01:09:57,793 --> 01:09:59,761
He has passed B. A in first class.

876
01:09:59,962 --> 01:10:01,759
He's very good and intelligent boy.

877
01:10:02,965 --> 01:10:03,665
What happened?

878
01:10:06,969 --> 01:10:07,765
Nothing!

879
01:10:09,305 --> 01:10:10,932
My life has become successful,

880
01:10:12,474 --> 01:10:14,101
I've got a son like Shekhar.

881
01:10:15,311 --> 01:10:16,608
And a husband like you.

882
01:10:18,314 --> 01:10:22,614
It's my good fortune that I got
a place at your feet.

883
01:10:22,818 --> 01:10:24,615
Sir, junior boss has come.

884
01:10:25,487 --> 01:10:27,955
Listen, Chiranjeev has arrived.

885
01:10:29,658 --> 01:10:32,786
Son Chiranjeev!

886
01:10:35,698 --> 01:10:36,398
Father!

887
01:10:38,334 --> 01:10:40,302
Son, come into my embrace!

888
01:10:41,337 --> 01:10:42,037
My son!

889
01:10:48,344 --> 01:10:52,644
Son, you've come back alive.
You've got a new life.

890
01:10:53,349 --> 01:10:54,646
We've been lucky!

891
01:10:55,351 --> 01:10:57,319
Your brother and sister are fine.

892
01:10:57,686 --> 01:10:59,153
And baby's leg has also
become alright!

893
01:10:59,855 --> 01:11:02,983
Son, do you know who's responsible
for all this happenings?

894
01:11:03,192 --> 01:11:05,660
Father, I know it. Mr. Accountant had
told me everything.

895
01:11:06,028 --> 01:11:08,826
Then... come... son... come
and meet your mother.

896
01:11:09,031 --> 01:11:10,498
She has been waiting for you
for a long time.

897
01:11:11,033 --> 01:11:12,500
Come son... Come... come.

898
01:11:35,891 --> 01:11:38,189
What are you watching son?
Go and seek her blessings.

899
01:11:38,394 --> 01:11:40,521
Bless our son, please!

900
01:12:09,925 --> 01:12:11,051
Live a long life.

901
01:12:37,119 --> 01:12:39,587
No... No... No... No

902
01:12:49,465 --> 01:12:50,165
No!

903
01:12:55,471 --> 01:12:56,171
Mother!

904
01:12:58,307 --> 01:12:59,103
Mother!

905
01:13:08,650 --> 01:13:12,609
Mother, you tell me
how did this happen?

906
01:13:13,822 --> 01:13:15,949
How am I to call her as mother?

907
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:19,127
How can I call her?

908
01:13:19,995 --> 01:13:20,962
How can I call her?

909
01:13:46,188 --> 01:13:46,888
Sir!

910
01:13:47,022 --> 01:13:47,722
What is it?

911
01:13:48,857 --> 01:13:49,983
What am I to say, sir?

912
01:13:50,692 --> 01:13:51,818
Oh! Come on, tell me
whatever it is.

913
01:13:53,362 --> 01:13:55,330
Sir... junior boss

914
01:13:55,697 --> 01:13:56,664
What did your Junior boss do?

915
01:13:57,866 --> 01:13:58,992
Sir, he has started
consuming liquor

916
01:13:59,201 --> 01:14:01,499
What did you say?
Started drinking liquor?

917
01:14:02,204 --> 01:14:04,331
Chiranjeev and liquor...
Impossible!

918
01:14:04,706 --> 01:14:05,673
You've gone mad.

919
01:14:05,874 --> 01:14:06,670
No, sir.

920
01:14:07,376 --> 01:14:11,176
I've got a letter from my friend.
He'll never write hearsays.

921
01:14:11,380 --> 01:14:12,677
But how did he get into
this bad habit?

922
01:14:13,048 --> 01:14:16,017
Did you hear this? Now he has
started drinking liquor.

923
01:14:16,218 --> 01:14:18,186
Whatever money he had
asked for, you had sent him.

924
01:14:18,554 --> 01:14:20,681
He'll not only ruin himself...
but family honour also.

925
01:14:20,856 --> 01:14:21,823
You be brave, Mr. Accountant.

926
01:14:22,891 --> 01:14:23,591
Yes, madam.

927
01:14:23,725 --> 01:14:25,522
You go and bring Chiranjeev
immediately here.

928
01:14:26,395 --> 01:14:32,527
World has abandoned me
it did a great thing.

929
01:14:32,901 --> 01:14:37,031
Yes... it did a great thing!

930
01:14:40,742 --> 01:14:44,701
It prompted me to drink
it did a great thing.

931
01:14:48,750 --> 01:14:59,217
It prompted me to drink, yes...
I did a great thing.

932
01:15:11,273 --> 01:15:16,905
Those moments of dreams were
just moments.

933
01:15:17,112 --> 01:15:20,741
In the moments, when
I woke up.

934
01:15:20,949 --> 01:15:29,254
Happiness of the world was
just a shadow.

935
01:15:29,458 --> 01:15:35,419
I had run, In whose desire
I had run.

936
01:15:37,299 --> 01:15:43,932
You shattered my dreams
you did a great thing.

937
01:15:44,139 --> 01:15:47,438
Yes... you did a great thing.

938
01:15:51,313 --> 01:16:01,621
You prompted me to drink, yes...
you did a great thing.

939
01:16:02,991 --> 01:16:07,792
Hey, where are you running?

940
01:16:08,330 --> 01:16:12,130
I'm swinging here and you
are hiding there.

941
01:16:12,334 --> 01:16:14,131
You're running away from me.

942
01:16:14,336 --> 01:16:15,803
You're deceiving me.

943
01:16:17,172 --> 01:16:24,135
When the world deserted me.

944
01:16:25,180 --> 01:16:31,312
When the world deserted me
bottle told me...

945
01:16:32,688 --> 01:16:36,647
Shall I tell, what it said,
I won't tell. Alright, I'll tell.

946
01:16:37,192 --> 01:16:41,151
Every afflicted person needs
me one day.

947
01:16:41,363 --> 01:16:44,992
You bonded the broken heart.

948
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:49,159
It did a good thing, yes...
it did a good thing.

949
01:16:51,540 --> 01:16:57,172
World abandoned me, it did
a nice thing.

950
01:16:57,879 --> 01:17:15,389
Yes... it did a nice thing.

951
01:17:26,241 --> 01:17:27,208
This has also cheated me.

952
01:17:30,912 --> 01:17:33,039
Who cheated you, dear?

953
01:17:34,249 --> 01:17:36,717
Can some arrangement be done?

954
01:17:41,757 --> 01:17:46,717
Lot of arrangements can be done
dear, but where is the money!

955
01:17:47,763 --> 01:17:51,563
Glass is empty, bottle is empty,
pocket is empty.

956
01:17:52,100 --> 01:17:55,399
Except this, this is filled
to the brim.

957
01:17:57,673 --> 01:18:00,403
...Shall I tell?
- Come on, tell.

958
01:18:02,944 --> 01:18:03,911
Who is it?

959
01:18:05,614 --> 01:18:08,913
Mohan go and open the door.

960
01:18:14,623 --> 01:18:16,250
You go and open the door.

961
01:18:17,459 --> 01:18:18,426
I'll open.

962
01:18:20,796 --> 01:18:23,264
Hey, I'll open the door.

963
01:18:25,634 --> 01:18:28,262
I'll open the door...

964
01:18:42,984 --> 01:18:45,282
Please come in.

965
01:18:46,655 --> 01:18:47,952
Open the door, sir.

966
01:18:48,156 --> 01:18:51,284
Door is open, you come inside.

967
01:18:53,161 --> 01:18:56,289
This is not the time
to joke.

968
01:18:56,832 --> 01:19:00,131
Hey, you fool, this is
not the door.

969
01:19:00,502 --> 01:19:01,298
Then, what is it?

970
01:19:01,503 --> 01:19:02,470
This is Almirah.

971
01:19:03,338 --> 01:19:04,038
Almirah!

972
01:19:05,841 --> 01:19:08,810
All right, I'll open the door
just wait.

973
01:19:11,513 --> 01:19:13,811
Come brother, come inside.

974
01:19:14,349 --> 01:19:16,977
But sir, how to come in
through the window?

975
01:19:17,519 --> 01:19:20,647
Window!? Shit, then where is
the door?

976
01:19:27,596 --> 01:19:28,392
Junior boss!

977
01:19:29,698 --> 01:19:30,398
Accountant?

978
01:19:30,866 --> 01:19:35,166
Yes junior boss, I've to take you.

01:19:37,205 --> 01:19:39,173
Home! - Yes, junior boss.

980
01:19:40,208 --> 01:19:41,004
Which home?

981
01:19:42,544 --> 01:19:45,843
Whose home? I'm in my home.

982
01:19:46,047 --> 01:19:49,175
Don't say like that junior boss.
Mistress has called you.

983
01:20:03,398 --> 01:20:04,865
What has happened to
junior boss?

984
01:20:08,069 --> 01:20:11,368
He has had an attack.

985
01:20:12,240 --> 01:20:12,940
Attack?

986
01:20:13,909 --> 01:20:16,878
Yes accountant, it is a very
dangerous disease.

987
01:20:17,245 --> 01:20:21,375
Doctor has written the prescription,
its a very nice medicine.

988
01:20:21,583 --> 01:20:24,711
But what to do, I've no money.

989
01:20:25,754 --> 01:20:27,381
You've money - Yes

990
01:20:27,589 --> 01:20:28,289
Give me.

991
01:20:29,257 --> 01:20:31,555
Take it, will Rs 5 suffice?

992
01:20:31,927 --> 01:20:35,556
Oh! Accountant, it won't fetch
even native medicine.

993
01:20:36,097 --> 01:20:37,394
This is English disease.

994
01:20:37,933 --> 01:20:42,734
Do one thing, give all the money, I'll
make him alright and send him home.

995
01:20:43,271 --> 01:20:44,898
Alright, please do send him.

996
01:20:45,106 --> 01:20:47,574
You go, I'll definitely
send him.

997
01:20:48,276 --> 01:20:52,576
And listen, dew is falling, open
the umbrella on the way.

998
01:20:54,950 --> 01:20:57,919
Here, money has come, cash.

999
01:20:58,954 --> 01:21:04,415
Leave my hand, If father comes to
know that I'm working in the play.

1000
01:21:04,793 --> 01:21:07,091
It'll be a disaster, I'm afraid.

1001
01:21:07,295 --> 01:21:10,594
Fear is the greatest enemy
of a person, Padma.

1002
01:21:10,966 --> 01:21:12,934
That's why, I'm staging this
mega play.

1003
01:21:13,134 --> 01:21:14,101
Play for the reformation
of home.

1004
01:21:14,302 --> 01:21:16,770
With this, my home will be reformed.
My daddy will be reformed.

1005
01:21:16,972 --> 01:21:19,941
Mother, society and the entire
world will be reformed.

1006
01:21:20,308 --> 01:21:23,106
Padma, won't you join me in this
crusade of reformation?

1007
01:21:23,645 --> 01:21:24,612
I'm ready.

1008
01:21:25,313 --> 01:21:28,771
But I'm afraid, father might
reform me, before that.

1009
01:21:28,984 --> 01:21:32,943
Oh! Why are you worried, that
play will reform your sir also.

1010
01:21:33,154 --> 01:21:35,281
Come, we'll start the rehearsals
immediately.

1011
01:21:37,826 --> 01:21:38,793
Sir, heroine's father has come.

1012
01:21:38,994 --> 01:21:40,962
Oh! In our play there is
no heroine's father.

1013
01:21:41,162 --> 01:21:41,862
What did you say?

1014
01:21:41,997 --> 01:21:42,697
Who is it?

1015
01:21:42,831 --> 01:21:43,957
Is he your father?

1016
01:21:46,835 --> 01:21:49,303
You've also fallen in the
trap of this rogue.

1017
01:21:50,005 --> 01:21:51,632
Hey, you hold all rascals.
Come out.

1018
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:53,467
It is not hold all, it is
hold on, hold on.

1019
01:21:53,842 --> 01:21:55,810
When it carries bed, hold all
becomes round.

1020
01:21:56,511 --> 01:22:00,140
If you entice my daughter again
I'll teach you a lesson, come.

1021
01:22:03,685 --> 01:22:06,654
Sir, heroine has gone! What'll
happen to our play now?

1022
01:22:06,855 --> 01:22:09,153
It'll be staged, play will be staged

1023
01:22:10,191 --> 01:22:11,158
Hey, Hey, come come.

More money! But boss, I don't
have a single penny.

1026
01:22:27,375 --> 01:22:28,342
Don't have a single penny?

1027
01:22:28,543 --> 01:22:29,243
Don't have penny.

1028
01:22:30,545 --> 01:22:32,513
Forget penny, give me rupees.

1029
01:22:32,714 --> 01:22:33,414
Rupees!

1030
01:22:33,548 --> 01:22:36,517
I can't give rupees, junior boss
senior boss will be angry.

1031
01:22:37,585 --> 01:22:38,552
He'll be angry?

1032
01:22:40,221 --> 01:22:41,688
Listen, you've the key... key.

Give it to me, I'll take out

01:22:45,226 --> 01:22:46,853
Then how can the senior boss
get angry?

1035
01:22:47,262 --> 01:22:52,222
No junior boss, it amounts to
the same thing.

1036
01:22:53,401 --> 01:22:54,368
Give accountant!

1037
01:22:55,070 --> 01:22:56,537
Forget it junior boss!

Accountant -Junior boss...

Won't give -I won't.

1040
01:23:05,914 --> 01:23:06,881
I'll kill you.

1041
01:23:07,082 --> 01:23:07,878
Don't do that Junior boss.

1042
01:23:08,416 --> 01:23:11,044
If I die, who'll handle
your accounts.

1043
01:23:11,252 --> 01:23:14,881
I'II, Mohan will, any one will, but
I'll kill you...

1044
01:23:15,757 --> 01:23:17,884
I'll kill you - I'll die.

1045
01:23:19,928 --> 01:23:20,628
My son.

1046
01:23:29,437 --> 01:23:30,233
Accountant.

1047
01:23:30,772 --> 01:23:31,568
Give me the keys.

1048
01:23:47,789 --> 01:23:51,418
Take it, it's your money, your
father's wealth.

1049
01:23:51,793 --> 01:23:54,261
Take as much as you want, why
should you quarrel?

1050
01:23:55,130 --> 01:23:56,597
Take, why don't you take it?

1051
01:24:54,355 --> 01:24:56,323
For this, you keep away
from here.

1052
01:24:57,192 --> 01:24:59,820
If it is true, then you can
sit here.

1053
01:25:00,528 --> 01:25:01,995
No one will stop you here.

1054
01:25:03,198 --> 01:25:06,497
But remember, there are other children also
in the house.

1055
01:25:07,202 --> 01:25:07,998
Younger to you.

1056
01:25:08,703 --> 01:25:10,500
Whatever the elder will do
youngsters will follow.

1057
01:25:12,207 --> 01:25:13,504
You are quite sensible.

1058
01:25:13,875 --> 01:25:14,842
Do whatever you like.

1059
01:25:28,223 --> 01:25:31,681
Don't throw the bottle, don't
throw the bottle.

1060
01:25:31,893 --> 01:25:35,192
Cruel fellow, it is liquor...

1061
01:25:35,897 --> 01:25:39,355
Don't throw brother, I'm coming.

1062
01:25:40,068 --> 01:25:46,530
Without these bottles
we can't survive.

1063
01:25:48,309 --> 01:25:53,372
I can live without uttering God's name
but not without liquor, my friend.

1064
01:25:54,582 --> 01:25:58,211
Yuck, what did you do?

1065
01:25:58,920 --> 01:26:01,718
With great difficulty the bottle
was obtained.

1066
01:26:02,590 --> 01:26:06,219
Doesn't matter, get up.
Get up.

1067
01:26:06,928 --> 01:26:08,153
Where did you get them?

1068
01:26:09,764 --> 01:26:14,064
When God gives, he
gives in plentiful.

1069
01:26:14,269 --> 01:26:16,237
This is the gift from the Goddess.

1070
01:26:18,273 --> 01:26:19,069
Gift from the Goddess?

1071
01:26:23,778 --> 01:26:25,245
What are you thinking?

1072
01:26:25,747 --> 01:26:29,410
Take it fast, otherwise we will lose
this money also.

1073
01:26:31,619 --> 01:26:32,745
Even If we get, what'll happen?

1074
01:26:33,288 --> 01:26:37,088
Crying eyes will laugh.

1075
01:26:38,293 --> 01:26:40,921
And the dull day will sparkle.

1076
01:26:43,631 --> 01:26:46,930
And when it finishes, then
what'll happen?

1077
01:26:47,635 --> 01:26:50,035
What will happen,
I'll tell you at that time.

1078
01:26:50,238 --> 01:26:53,264
You come and try friend, let a peg
get inside you.

1079
01:26:53,808 --> 01:26:58,609
Get up... come my friend!

1080
01:27:04,319 --> 01:27:05,786
Sit here father! Why are
you so scared?

1081
01:27:05,987 --> 01:27:08,182
I'm staging the drama, only
for you.

1082
01:27:08,656 --> 01:27:11,454
After seeing this drama, you'll gain
strength! Your spirits will soar high.

1083
01:27:11,659 --> 01:27:13,957
Sparrow will challenge
an eagle!

1084
01:27:14,229 --> 01:27:15,958
And the Rabbit will fight
with the Lion.

1085
01:27:16,998 --> 01:27:17,794
Don't say it with anyone!

1086
01:27:39,654 --> 01:27:42,020
What do you do every morning?

1087
01:27:42,290 --> 01:27:44,417
Oh! Dear, reading scriptures.

1088
01:27:44,726 --> 01:27:46,887
Oh! You fool... you idiot.

1089
01:27:47,095 --> 01:27:49,188
Don't you've any other work?

1090
01:27:49,364 --> 01:27:53,733
I find you always with the book
chanting Lord Rama's name.

1091
01:27:54,035 --> 01:27:58,335
Oh! My dear, chanting Lord Ramas
name is no sin, Isn't it?

1092
01:27:58,740 --> 01:28:03,370
You don't have a father to
serve you ready food.

1093
01:28:05,880 --> 01:28:11,512
Oh! Dear please say it
in a whisper.

1094
01:28:11,719 --> 01:28:13,846
Am I shouting at the
top of my voice?

1095
01:28:14,055 --> 01:28:16,353
Oh! Dear don't mix poison
with all your words.

1096
01:28:16,557 --> 01:28:18,525
I'm adding Nectar in my words!

1097
01:28:18,726 --> 01:28:27,862
If this is Nectar, then Nectar
is waiting but a cup of poison.

1098
01:28:28,069 --> 01:28:37,376
I'll not become a widow
just because you said it.

1099
01:28:37,745 --> 01:28:39,872
Weigh pros and cons before you
utter the words.

1100
01:28:40,081 --> 01:28:42,208
I'm saying it after weighing
the pros and cons only.

1101
01:28:51,926 --> 01:28:56,226
Oh! Mr. Sundar Lal, how are you?

1102
01:28:56,431 --> 01:29:00,561
Getting her pecked, I'm living
a demoralised life.

1103
01:29:00,768 --> 01:29:04,727
If I keep quiet, she'll get angry
if I say, then I'm finished.

1104
01:29:04,939 --> 01:29:09,103
Buddy! Get me from somewhere
a magic potion!

1105
01:29:09,777 --> 01:29:13,713
So that when I smoke it with my hookah
this tyrant will vanish.

1106
01:29:16,451 --> 01:29:25,416
Look at this henpecked
husband.

1107
01:29:25,793 --> 01:29:35,100
Watch out the way Manhood
is getting insulted.

1108
01:29:53,821 --> 01:30:02,957
He gets beaten up by a woman but
still raise a hand against her.

1109
01:30:03,331 --> 01:30:12,797
Then tell me brother why has he
come into this world?

1110
01:30:17,512 --> 01:30:26,819
Look at this simpleton!

1111
01:30:37,698 --> 01:30:48,006
Why're you so sad? When poet Thulasidas
had said in the past...

1112
01:30:48,209 --> 01:30:50,677
I'm an uneducated man!

1113
01:30:50,878 --> 01:30:52,846
I didn't read the epic
Ramayana.

1114
01:30:53,047 --> 01:30:57,347
If I do read then the
hag will be after me.

1115
01:30:58,886 --> 01:31:05,655
Then listen, I'll tell you
a way out!

1116
01:31:06,227 --> 01:31:10,254
You'll be surprised.

1117
01:31:11,365 --> 01:31:15,358
Without any effort.

1118
01:31:16,170 --> 01:31:21,540
But, you'll be thrilled.

1119
01:31:38,593 --> 01:31:42,723
Useless fool... Idiot!
May you go to hell.

1120
01:31:43,097 --> 01:31:47,397
Come on tell, what's this bad smell
from you today?

1121
01:31:47,768 --> 01:31:52,228
Today, I've come home drunk and
making other's also to drink.

1122
01:31:52,440 --> 01:31:54,738
Tell me where did you get
money to drink?

1123
01:31:54,942 --> 01:31:57,069
Don't think that I've stolen it
from somewhere.

1124
01:31:57,278 --> 01:31:59,405
I had this drinking binge along
with your father!

1125
01:31:59,614 --> 01:32:01,741
Are you taking my father's
name?

1126
01:32:01,949 --> 01:32:04,076
Your father is a great drunkard.

1127
01:32:04,285 --> 01:32:08,585
My father?! - Yes your father
is a great cheat.

1128
01:32:08,789 --> 01:32:20,257
My father!?! - Yes your father
my father... My father... my father.

1129
01:32:21,135 --> 01:32:23,603
Oh! God! What has happened
to him?

1130
01:32:23,804 --> 01:32:26,102
Oh! Dear the times have changed.

1131
01:32:28,309 --> 01:32:34,942
Come on, tell me, will you talk
in low voice? - I 'Will'.

1132
01:32:35,149 --> 01:32:37,276
Will you ever mix poison in
your words?

1133
01:32:37,485 --> 01:32:39,953
...No... no... I'll mix nectar!

1134
01:32:44,325 --> 01:32:49,786
Forgive me, my Lord.

1135
01:32:49,997 --> 01:32:52,124
I'll weigh pros and cons before
uttering the words.

1136
01:32:52,333 --> 01:33:03,972
I'll talk in a low voice always.

1137
01:33:06,681 --> 01:33:10,481
I feel everything bad is
going on here.

1138
01:33:10,685 --> 01:33:16,646
Getting up by 10 AM and sleeping like
a touch-me-not plant before 6 PM.

1139
01:33:17,258 --> 01:33:17,986
Am I doing fine, son?

1140
01:33:18,192 --> 01:33:19,489
You're fantastic father...
fantastic.

1141
01:33:19,694 --> 01:33:22,663
Did you rule like this even
in your parent's home?

1142
01:33:22,930 --> 01:33:26,661
Come down immediately and bow
as a respect to me.

1143
01:33:27,034 --> 01:33:27,734
Who's that?

1144
01:33:31,038 --> 01:33:32,665
Your mother! Come son
let's go!

1145
01:33:32,873 --> 01:33:37,003
Father, don't show your back to her!
At least stand bravely against her.

1146
01:33:37,211 --> 01:33:40,180
Son! My hands and legs are
shivering.

1147
01:33:40,381 --> 01:33:42,906
I'm also in thoughts, how's that the
art had developed wings?

1148
01:33:43,217 --> 01:33:46,015
It's midnight and both father and son
have vanished away from the house.

1149
01:33:46,387 --> 01:33:48,446
As if this is not a house but
a free shelter home.

1150
01:33:49,290 --> 01:33:52,020
Why don't you say something?
Have you been bitten by a snake?

1151
01:33:52,293 --> 01:33:54,090
Son! You tell her.

1152
01:33:54,228 --> 01:33:55,695
No father, you only tell her.

1153
01:33:56,731 --> 01:34:02,033
Oh! Dear the thing is that... we both
went out to watch a drama.

1154
01:34:02,303 --> 01:34:03,031
What did you say? - No...

1155
01:34:03,237 --> 01:34:04,033
Drama?! - Yes!

1156
01:34:04,405 --> 01:34:07,533
Hear this! He has also joined the
crowds painting his face.

1157
01:34:07,742 --> 01:34:09,369
Wait! I'll show you a drama.

1158
01:34:09,577 --> 01:34:11,704
...Come on... go out... go out
from here... go...

1159
01:34:11,979 --> 01:34:13,879
Mother... Mother! It was my mistake.
Father is innocent.

1160
01:34:14,081 --> 01:34:15,378
It's me, who should be
punished?

1161
01:34:15,750 --> 01:34:18,378
Let father sleep inside!
I'll sleep outside.

1162
01:34:18,586 --> 01:34:22,545
No son, you also sleep here only
you and me...

1163
01:34:22,757 --> 01:34:24,224
No you and me's! Get out...
get out...

1164
01:34:24,425 --> 01:34:29,727
Mother, please listen to me,
I say get out... get out - Mother.

1165
01:34:29,997 --> 01:34:33,228
Mother, listen to me, father will feel
very cold! It's very chill outside.

1166
01:34:37,438 --> 01:34:38,405
We'll feel very hungry.

1167
01:34:39,106 --> 01:34:41,301
Feel hungry?!

1168
01:34:42,109 --> 01:34:46,068
Feel hungry? Feel cold? All this
drama won't work with me.

1169
01:34:52,119 --> 01:34:52,915
Mannerless!

1170
01:34:53,621 --> 01:34:57,079
When I'm coming, you must give way
by moving aside, Isn't it?

1171
01:35:00,695 --> 01:35:03,596
Move aside... move aside... move aside.

1172
01:35:03,798 --> 01:35:04,924
Shekhar, please forgive him.

1173
01:35:05,132 --> 01:35:09,091
If he dies, this poor boy's
mother will cry.

1174
01:35:14,975 --> 01:35:15,675
Mother!

1175
01:35:30,157 --> 01:35:32,284
What's all this madness?

1176
01:35:33,828 --> 01:35:38,629
No... nothing! You can't
understand.

1177
01:35:40,167 --> 01:35:41,794
Do you know, what I'm
going through?

1178
01:35:42,002 --> 01:35:44,470
I know everything!

1179
01:35:45,005 --> 01:35:48,634
Look! You accept Sharda
as a mother once.

1180
01:35:49,176 --> 01:35:50,973
That's what, I'm unable to do.

1181
01:35:51,178 --> 01:35:54,807
This is the only remedy which
can bring good to you.

1182
01:35:55,015 --> 01:35:58,644
No... no! There's death for
me in this word.

1183
01:35:59,186 --> 01:36:01,814
Only she's the mother who gave
birth to me.

1184
01:36:02,523 --> 01:36:03,319
He's mad.

1185
01:36:04,859 --> 01:36:05,559
Who's that?

1186
01:36:09,363 --> 01:36:13,993
Oh! Why're you breaking the doors?
I'm opening, Isn't it?

1187
01:36:14,535 --> 01:36:15,502
Come in... Come in.

1188
01:36:15,703 --> 01:36:19,332
Oh! Inspector! Is it you?
Oh, you've also come here

1189
01:36:19,540 --> 01:36:21,667
So! You were supplying to
these people only, Isn't it?

1190
01:36:21,876 --> 01:36:28,679
Inspector! Take this! I've not seen
his face for the last 7 days.

1191
01:36:28,883 --> 01:36:32,341
Hey! Where did you go away?
We had to undergo a lot of trouble.

1192
01:36:32,586 --> 01:36:34,884
Is this the work to be done
by educated people like you?

1193
01:36:35,055 --> 01:36:38,183
Inspector! I'm an addict!
What can I do, sir?

1194
01:36:38,392 --> 01:36:39,359
Are the goods original?

1195
01:36:39,560 --> 01:36:40,857
Arrest both of them.

1196
01:36:41,896 --> 01:36:45,024
Don't take that trouble
we'll come ourselves.

1197
01:36:45,399 --> 01:36:46,866
You go that side, I'll go
this side.

1198
01:36:47,067 --> 01:36:48,864
Come here.

1199
01:37:05,920 --> 01:37:07,717
You were the one who asked me to
bring my son...

1200
01:37:07,922 --> 01:37:08,889
I've brought him.

1201
01:37:09,423 --> 01:37:11,050
You have done a good thing.

1202
01:37:13,260 --> 01:37:14,386
What's all this?

1203
01:37:14,595 --> 01:37:16,222
Getting it ready for a journey.

1204
01:37:17,765 --> 01:37:19,232
Journey? Where?

1205
01:37:19,600 --> 01:37:20,897
How do I know it, sir?

1206
01:37:23,604 --> 01:37:25,231
Girish, you tell me!

1207
01:37:25,439 --> 01:37:26,406
Don't talk to me.

1208
01:37:28,776 --> 01:37:30,243
Baby, at least you tell me.

1209
01:37:43,290 --> 01:37:45,087
What's all this happening?
- We're going.

1210
01:37:45,459 --> 01:37:46,926
Going? Where?

1211
01:37:47,294 --> 01:37:49,922
I don't know! - You know it.
Why don't you tell me?

1212
01:37:50,297 --> 01:37:55,257
I'll tell you! We're leaving so that
no one will be here to stop you.

1213
01:37:55,469 --> 01:37:56,766
Do whatever you wish to do.

1214
01:37:56,971 --> 01:37:59,940
Consume liquor, ruin the family honour
on the streets.

1215
01:38:00,307 --> 01:38:01,774
You like to do only such things,
Isn't it?

1216
01:38:02,142 --> 01:38:03,268
What can we do?

1217
01:38:03,677 --> 01:38:05,144
We're unable to see all this.

1218
01:38:05,646 --> 01:38:06,346
Take this!

1219
01:38:08,983 --> 01:38:09,683
What is it?

1220
01:38:09,984 --> 01:38:11,611
Your house! Your wealth!

1221
01:38:16,657 --> 01:38:17,783
One more thing!

1222
01:38:18,492 --> 01:38:20,619
When all your desires
get fulfilled.

1223
01:38:21,161 --> 01:38:22,958
When your entire wealth
is spent.

1224
01:38:23,330 --> 01:38:24,797
And when all your friends
have left you.

1225
01:38:24,999 --> 01:38:29,299
And God forbid, such a condition, there's
not a sympathiser left for you.

1226
01:38:30,337 --> 01:38:31,804
Don't forget at that moment.

1227
01:38:32,539 --> 01:38:34,632
That, in this world
you have a mother.

1228
01:38:35,609 --> 01:38:37,474
Who can sacrifice her life
for you.

1229
01:38:42,883 --> 01:38:43,815
What can I do now, Mother?

1230
01:38:44,351 --> 01:38:47,980
For once accept Sharda Devi
as your Mother.

1231
01:38:49,423 --> 01:38:51,323
This is the word which
I can't utter, Mohan.

1232
01:38:51,525 --> 01:38:54,983
Hey! This is the only word which
can bring good to you.

1233
01:38:55,229 --> 01:38:57,163
There's death for me in it!

1234
01:38:58,632 --> 01:39:00,998
Only she's my mother, who gave
birth to me.

1235
01:39:02,036 --> 01:39:03,663
Son! She is also your mother.

1236
01:39:04,071 --> 01:39:05,538
She has accepted you like that.

1237
01:39:05,773 --> 01:39:06,899
Shekhar stop her.

1238
01:39:07,975 --> 01:39:08,805
No mother.

1239
01:39:08,976 --> 01:39:11,206
If she goes away! I'll also
not stay here any more.

1240
01:39:11,679 --> 01:39:12,379
Mother!

1241
01:39:12,546 --> 01:39:15,845
Watch carefully! You can see
me in her.

1242
01:39:16,050 --> 01:39:18,348
It's my heart, that's beating
in her.

1243
01:39:18,552 --> 01:39:20,349
My soul had entered her soul.

1244
01:39:20,721 --> 01:39:23,690
I'm Sharda! And Sharda
is your mother.

1245
01:39:24,224 --> 01:39:30,857
No... no... no... no!

1246
01:39:34,468 --> 01:39:36,026
Look! Listen!

1247
01:39:40,407 --> 01:39:41,704
Please don't leave this house
and go away.

1248
01:39:42,676 --> 01:39:44,940
I've committed a mistake.
Please pardon me.

1249
01:39:45,512 --> 01:39:47,742
I promise, I'll never drink again.

1250
01:39:47,915 --> 01:39:49,382
Trust me!

1251
01:39:50,017 --> 01:39:51,712
How can I believe a
drunkard's words?

1252
01:39:53,454 --> 01:39:57,254
Father trust me! I'll never
again touch liquor!

1253
01:39:57,491 --> 01:39:58,389
...Please don't allow her to go!

1254
01:39:58,759 --> 01:40:01,557
Come on! What are you waiting for?
It's getting late.

1255
01:40:03,964 --> 01:40:05,556
Father, don't go away!

1256
01:40:06,100 --> 01:40:15,065
Girish! Baby! Don't go away,
leaving me alone.

1257
01:40:18,846 --> 01:40:19,904
Mother!

1258
01:40:23,450 --> 01:40:24,150
Mother!

1259
01:40:25,786 --> 01:40:27,083
Son!

1260
01:40:31,625 --> 01:40:33,092
Don't leave me and go away!

1261
01:40:53,547 --> 01:40:54,445
Mother, forgive me.

1262
01:40:55,749 --> 01:40:56,943
I promise you.

1263
01:40:58,419 --> 01:41:00,114
I'll do whatever you ask
me to do.

1264
01:41:03,490 --> 01:41:07,620
Mother bless me! That I may
keep my promise.

1265
01:41:10,998 --> 01:41:11,698
Son!

1266
01:41:14,334 --> 01:41:16,632
Send a message to Hukumchandas.

1267
01:41:16,837 --> 01:41:18,464
That they start the preparations
for the marriage.

1268
01:41:19,339 --> 01:41:20,039
Mother.

1269
01:41:28,849 --> 01:41:32,307
Father! Do as mother says...

1270
01:41:42,696 --> 01:41:43,993
Mother asked for a
daughter-in-law!

1271
01:41:46,200 --> 01:41:46,996
And I said, yes!

1272
01:41:48,735 --> 01:41:49,997
And how happy mother
is today.

1273
01:41:50,704 --> 01:41:51,500
And you?!

1274
01:41:52,873 --> 01:41:54,170
Mother's happiness is my happiness.

1275
01:41:54,374 --> 01:41:56,171
It's good that I had accepted
mother's suggestion.

1276
01:41:56,610 --> 01:41:58,009
Otherwise, I would've remained
a bachelor all my life.

1277
01:42:02,416 --> 01:42:05,010
You seem to be an ideal
mother's son.

1278
01:42:08,555 --> 01:42:09,681
Remember one thing.

1279
01:42:10,958 --> 01:42:13,017
Never make fun of my mother
even for fun.

1280
01:42:13,727 --> 01:42:15,695
No one in this house can
reach her place.

1281
01:42:16,730 --> 01:42:18,357
No one should dare seeing
her eye to eye.

1282
01:42:19,967 --> 01:42:23,869
Can't I see you also
eye to eye?

1283
01:42:24,972 --> 01:42:26,200
It's different with me.

1284
01:42:27,174 --> 01:42:29,039
You are great!

1285
01:42:34,181 --> 01:42:57,596
Protector of the entire universe.

1286
01:42:58,772 --> 01:43:05,075
Eternal flame of light.

1287
01:43:11,585 --> 01:43:17,546
Epitome of all goodness!

1288
01:43:24,498 --> 01:43:32,303
Epitome of truthfulness.

1289
01:43:43,483 --> 01:43:44,950
May God bless you with
happiness.

1290
01:43:52,192 --> 01:43:54,126
Let a moon like son play
in your lap.

1291
01:44:11,178 --> 01:44:12,805
Sundari! How's that you're
here?

1292
01:44:13,013 --> 01:44:14,810
Greetings mother!

1293
01:44:19,186 --> 01:44:19,886
Mother!

1294
01:44:21,088 --> 01:44:21,986
Come upstairs for a
moment please.

1295
01:44:22,556 --> 01:44:23,318
I'm coming.

1296
01:44:24,291 --> 01:44:25,485
Is he your husband?

1297
01:44:25,692 --> 01:44:28,320
Yes! I'll introduce him
to you right now.

1298
01:44:28,862 --> 01:44:30,659
Excuse me! Please come here
for a moment.

1299
01:44:31,365 --> 01:44:33,492
I'm busy now, mother! - Please come.

1300
01:44:34,968 --> 01:44:36,993
Child, manage things here!

1301
01:44:45,545 --> 01:44:47,513
How did she come here?

1302
01:44:47,881 --> 01:44:50,008
Don't you know? She's my
mother-in-law.

1303
01:44:50,217 --> 01:44:52,014
My father-in-law married
second time.

1304
01:44:52,552 --> 01:44:54,349
Is it? Now, I've understood!

1305
01:44:54,888 --> 01:44:58,346
Tell me one thing! You and your husband
get along well, Isn't it?

1306
01:44:58,592 --> 01:45:01,356
What am I to say?
It's a long story.

1307
01:45:01,928 --> 01:45:04,192
Whenever I think of it,
I become sad.

1308
01:45:04,398 --> 01:45:07,367
Then, whatever I had thought
is right.

1309
01:45:08,068 --> 01:45:09,035
What has come right?

1310
01:45:09,403 --> 01:45:10,103
Come here!

1311
01:45:11,772 --> 01:45:14,070
Touch any one first from
these two.

1312
01:45:14,574 --> 01:45:15,541
But, what's that?

1313
01:45:16,576 --> 01:45:17,276
Nothing, Mother!

1314
01:45:17,411 --> 01:45:18,537
Father's just...

1315
01:45:19,246 --> 01:45:22,545
We'll come to know, if daughter-in-law
will have a boy or girl?

1316
01:45:23,250 --> 01:45:23,950
Is it?

1317
01:45:27,754 --> 01:45:28,454
Give it to me!

1318
01:45:28,588 --> 01:45:30,715
Son! Take this... Read
what's written in it.

1319
01:45:31,892 --> 01:45:33,223
It's the same, what I had
told you, Isn't it?

1320
01:45:34,161 --> 01:45:35,890
No! - Isn't it a son?

1321
01:45:36,430 --> 01:45:37,130
Girl!

1322
01:45:38,098 --> 01:45:39,395
Okay! It doesn't make any
difference.

1323
01:45:39,599 --> 01:45:41,226
Goddess of wealth is coming
to our home.

1324
01:45:42,369 --> 01:45:44,564
Is it true?
- Yes, it's true!

1325
01:45:44,938 --> 01:45:47,406
I've seen both of them together
in the monastry.

1326
01:45:47,607 --> 01:45:50,735
You may've to repent all your life
if you don't pay attention now.

1327
01:45:51,278 --> 01:45:53,405
Okay! I'll leave now!

1328
01:45:58,185 --> 01:45:59,584
Daughter-in-law is
standing alone.

1329
01:45:59,953 --> 01:46:02,751
Is everything ready?
- Everything is ready!

1330
01:46:06,460 --> 01:46:09,759
Okay! I'll come late in the evening.
- Okay!

1331
01:46:13,967 --> 01:46:15,264
I've come to know your secret.

1332
01:46:15,469 --> 01:46:17,266
And I too have come to know
about your secret.

1333
01:46:17,471 --> 01:46:19,268
Your's... you, Mother and son's!

1334
01:46:21,975 --> 01:46:23,000
What are you saying?

1335
01:46:23,310 --> 01:46:27,770
What is the meaning of the reputation
created by your mother?

1336
01:46:27,981 --> 01:46:30,779
You're always after her
chanting Mother... Mother.

1337
01:46:30,984 --> 01:46:31,951
What's the treachery behind that?

1338
01:46:32,152 --> 01:46:33,779
Shut up! Chanchal, shut up
- I'll not shut up!

1339
01:46:34,488 --> 01:46:36,115
I know what has happened in the
Nature Cure Centre.

1340
01:46:36,323 --> 01:46:37,119
Enough!

1341
01:46:37,324 --> 01:46:40,122
If your heart was on someone else.
Why did you then marry me?

1342
01:46:40,660 --> 01:46:42,628
Why did you make my mother-in-law
as your second wife?

1343
01:46:43,363 --> 01:46:45,126
How sour these words look?

1344
01:46:45,499 --> 01:46:47,126
But, I'll not stop this here itself

1345
01:46:47,334 --> 01:46:48,961
I'll take it to your father also.

1346
01:46:53,240 --> 01:46:55,140
Cheap woman!

1347
01:46:55,342 --> 01:46:56,969
Do you want to take my
revenge on my father?

1348
01:46:57,511 --> 01:47:00,309
I'll kill you before you do that.

1349
01:47:00,680 --> 01:47:03,478
Son! Have you gone mad? Are you
raising hands on your wife?

1350
01:47:03,683 --> 01:47:04,483
Mother, move away!

1351
01:47:05,685 --> 01:47:07,312
Who are you to interfere in this?

1352
01:47:07,521 --> 01:47:09,989
What work do you've in my room?
Get out.

1353
01:47:10,190 --> 01:47:14,320
Mannerless brute! - Leave her...
Leave her.

1354
01:47:21,701 --> 01:47:24,670
It was my mistake to enter
your room, daughter-in-law.

1355
01:47:25,071 --> 01:47:26,163
Please forgive me.

1356
01:47:33,146 --> 01:47:36,013
You've crossed limits of decency.

1357
01:47:36,216 --> 01:47:38,184
Mother, you don't know,
what she had abused you.

1358
01:47:38,418 --> 01:47:42,184
I know it... I know this also,
how much she loves you.

1359
01:47:42,722 --> 01:47:44,690
Husband is everything for a woman.

1360
01:47:45,091 --> 01:47:47,525
Okay! I'll not speak to you.

1361
01:47:47,727 --> 01:47:50,855
Not only that! You'll never
come face to face with him.

1362
01:47:51,398 --> 01:47:52,365
I'll not come.

1363
01:47:52,566 --> 01:47:55,865
You'll not look after him.
- I'll not.

1364
01:47:56,069 --> 01:47:58,196
You'll never think about him also.

1365
01:47:58,972 --> 01:48:00,530
I'll not think!

1366
01:48:00,774 --> 01:48:02,537
Now, you can go.

1367
01:48:17,524 --> 01:48:18,388
Have your food!

1368
01:48:19,259 --> 01:48:20,453
I don't want any food.

1369
01:48:21,294 --> 01:48:23,592
Till, when you'll be stead fast
like this?

1370
01:48:24,464 --> 01:48:25,431
Till my last breath.

1371
01:48:26,433 --> 01:48:27,400
You're crossing limits.
- Was it I or you?

1372
01:48:27,667 --> 01:48:28,998
Is it mine? Or yours?

1373
01:48:29,436 --> 01:48:32,200
It was my mistake to ask
you to have food.

1374
01:48:32,439 --> 01:48:34,566
Okay, I ask your forgiveness.

1375
01:48:34,841 --> 01:48:36,274
Leave you anger and have food.

1376
01:48:36,476 --> 01:48:37,443
I've told you that, I'll not eat.

1377
01:48:37,611 --> 01:48:38,908
Food prepared by you is
poison to me.

1378
01:48:42,115 --> 01:48:44,709
What's happening in this house?

1379
01:48:45,619 --> 01:48:48,087
It's a matter between wife and husband.
They'll settle it amongst themselves.

1380
01:48:48,288 --> 01:48:49,255
What they'll settle themselves?

1381
01:48:49,456 --> 01:48:51,083
Since the day daughter-in-law
came into this house.

1382
01:48:51,291 --> 01:48:52,258
A fight is ensured everyday.

1383
01:48:52,459 --> 01:48:53,585
Why don't you put some
sense into her?

1384
01:48:54,628 --> 01:48:57,597
When you try to explain them sometimes
it may worsen the situation.

1385
01:48:58,031 --> 01:48:59,760
You carry on with your work.

1386
01:49:08,808 --> 01:49:10,435
You've made a mountain of a mole hill.

1387
01:49:10,710 --> 01:49:13,008
If you think, I'll go away to
my parent's home for this.

1388
01:49:13,146 --> 01:49:13,942
You're mistaken.

1389
01:49:14,147 --> 01:49:15,944
No need for you to go.
I'll go myself.

1390
01:49:16,149 --> 01:49:17,616
And I'll not see your face
all my life.

1391
01:49:17,817 --> 01:49:19,444
Try this threats on someone else.

1392
01:49:19,719 --> 01:49:21,346
What'll happen even if you go away?

1393
01:49:21,488 --> 01:49:23,786
Someone's love will drag you
here within a short period.

1394
01:49:23,990 --> 01:49:25,287
How mean you are?

1395
01:49:25,492 --> 01:49:26,959
I'll become one and show you.

1396
01:49:27,160 --> 01:49:29,788
One day, your secret will be out
in front of your father.

1397
01:49:30,063 --> 01:49:30,859
What did you say?

1398
01:49:35,001 --> 01:49:36,298
Remember one thing clearly.

1399
01:49:36,836 --> 01:49:39,134
The day you open the secret
before my father.

1400
01:49:39,506 --> 01:49:41,474
You'll find me dead.

1401
01:49:51,851 --> 01:49:54,820
Mother, I want to ask you.

1402
01:49:55,689 --> 01:49:57,657
When your son's heart get
broken with sadness.

1403
01:49:58,191 --> 01:49:59,658
Then go and show it to her.

1404
01:50:11,037 --> 01:50:14,996
God, save my son!

1405
01:50:29,289 --> 01:50:30,050
Where are you going?

1406
01:50:30,056 --> 01:50:31,023
To Chanchal's house.

1407
01:50:31,324 --> 01:50:32,024
Why?

1408
01:50:33,593 --> 01:50:36,221
Sending my child into a hell
asking me now, why?

1409
01:50:36,396 --> 01:50:38,023
Son-in-law has run away
from the house.

1410
01:50:38,231 --> 01:50:41,200
She'll be worried! I'll stay
with her for 10-12 days.

1411
01:50:41,401 --> 01:50:46,031
But our son says we must not
interfere in their family matter.

1412
01:50:46,239 --> 01:50:48,036
Look, don't get into his words.

1413
01:50:48,241 --> 01:50:49,868
He's been possessed by her.

1414
01:50:50,110 --> 01:50:52,237
Which ever way she turns his
head will turn to that side.

1415
01:50:52,412 --> 01:50:53,504
What are you saying?

1416
01:50:53,713 --> 01:50:56,238
How can you know that you were
not here at that time?

1417
01:50:56,483 --> 01:51:00,886
They both joined hands together and
tortured me and my daughter so much.

1418
01:51:01,087 --> 01:51:02,452
Are you saying the truth?

1419
01:51:02,656 --> 01:51:06,820
It's absolute truth, if you don't believe
go upstairs and check with her.

1420
01:51:07,027 --> 01:51:08,790
He would be massaging that
Empress's legs.

1421
01:51:09,029 --> 01:51:11,657
Okay, you wait here only.
I'll check and come.

1422
01:51:22,342 --> 01:51:26,142
You idiot! You henpecked husband.
What are you doing?

1423
01:51:29,449 --> 01:51:32,748
You fool! Aren't...

1424
01:51:32,952 --> 01:51:36,080
If not bothered about yourself at least,
you should've bothered about my honour.

1425
01:51:36,556 --> 01:51:39,753
Forgive me father! I learnt
all this from you only.

1426
01:51:40,060 --> 01:51:42,654
Not only this, my children will
learn from me.

1427
01:51:42,862 --> 01:51:44,989
My children's children will
learn from my children.

1428
01:51:45,298 --> 01:51:47,926
My children's children's children,
will learn from my children's children.

1429
01:51:48,168 --> 01:51:51,604
And like this our tradition will pass on,
from generation to generation.

1430
01:51:51,805 --> 01:51:54,501
Enough... enough! Son
I've got the point.

1431
01:51:55,809 --> 01:51:58,141
Watch out, I'll blow her
into smithereens.

1432
01:51:58,344 --> 01:52:01,780
Neither the wife will be there
nor her tortures.

1433
01:52:01,981 --> 01:52:04,415
You can't go to your
daughter's house.

1434
01:52:04,617 --> 01:52:07,142
Those days are over when you
ruled roost over here.

1435
01:52:07,353 --> 01:52:08,320
Now, it's my rule!

1436
01:52:08,521 --> 01:52:12,116
What's the mistake of him, he had
taken me as a role model.

1437
01:52:12,325 --> 01:52:14,623
Whatever he had seen me doing
he has just followed it

1438
01:52:14,928 --> 01:52:17,226
After all he's my son.
He'll be like me only, isn't it?

1439
01:52:17,330 --> 01:52:18,319
His son will be like him.

1440
01:52:18,531 --> 01:52:20,624
And his son's son will be
like his son.

1441
01:52:20,834 --> 01:52:25,931
Like this, just because of me, my entire
future generations will get spoiled.

1442
01:52:26,139 --> 01:52:27,902
And I'll not allow this to
happen at any cost.

1443
01:52:28,108 --> 01:52:31,236
That's why, I'm saying you can't
go to Chanchal's house.

1444
01:52:31,678 --> 01:52:34,772
Get lost! Show all this bravery
on someone else.

1445
01:52:34,981 --> 01:52:35,681
I'll go!

1446
01:52:36,649 --> 01:52:37,349
Wait!

1447
01:52:37,584 --> 01:52:40,314
Keep the suitcase down and take this
book from this table immediately.

1448
01:52:40,520 --> 01:52:41,220
I'll not take it.

1449
01:52:41,354 --> 01:52:42,685
Won't you take it? - No.

1450
01:52:42,889 --> 01:52:48,486
I'll not take it.
- Won't you take it?

1451
01:52:48,695 --> 01:52:50,822
Okay... okay... I'll take it.

1452
01:52:51,397 --> 01:52:53,365
Come on take it immediately
and write God's name.

1453
01:52:54,100 --> 01:52:54,800
Not here...

1454
01:52:55,401 --> 01:52:56,299
In that corner.

1455
01:52:56,503 --> 01:52:58,061
That corner is yours.

1456
01:52:58,371 --> 01:53:00,396
Those days are over! Now that
corner belongs to you.

1457
01:53:00,907 --> 01:53:02,238
Come on go! - No, I'll not go.

1458
01:53:02,442 --> 01:53:03,142
Won't you go?

1459
01:53:06,780 --> 01:53:07,712
I'll not go!

1460
01:53:08,481 --> 01:53:09,277
Won't you go?

1461
01:53:09,482 --> 01:53:10,210
I'll go... I'll go.

1462
01:53:10,416 --> 01:53:11,474
Talk in a low voice.

1463
01:53:11,684 --> 01:53:13,709
What? Am I shouting at
the top of my voice?

1464
01:53:13,920 --> 01:53:16,787
You're going on asking me to
speak in a low voice.

1465
01:53:16,990 --> 01:53:19,288
You're becoming a dominating
woman day by day.

1466
01:53:19,492 --> 01:53:20,192
Go inside.

1467
01:53:20,326 --> 01:53:21,384
I'll go... I'll go.

1468
01:53:23,429 --> 01:53:24,896
Write God's name.

1469
01:53:25,231 --> 01:53:26,027
I'll not write.

1470
01:53:26,232 --> 01:53:27,130
Won't you write?

1471
01:53:27,400 --> 01:53:28,594
I'll write... I'll write...

1472
01:53:29,202 --> 01:53:31,227
Write... Lord Ram.

1473
01:53:32,238 --> 01:53:35,036
Oh! This is the last scene
of our drama.

1474
01:53:35,241 --> 01:53:36,173
Don't back off now.

1475
01:53:36,409 --> 01:53:38,240
I can't do it anymore.
I'm scared.

1476
01:53:38,444 --> 01:53:40,605
Then, I'm also scared of
this life.

1477
01:53:40,947 --> 01:53:42,608
God of Death... God of Death.

1478
01:53:42,716 --> 01:53:43,540
Please keep this away.

1479
01:53:43,550 --> 01:53:45,142
Okay, I'll do whatever you
want me to do.

1480
01:53:45,418 --> 01:53:47,045
Is it? Then, start your action.

1481
01:53:47,253 --> 01:53:50,984
Padma, you're trying to dominate me.

1482
01:53:51,191 --> 01:53:53,125
This will not happen.
Go inside... Go...

1483
01:53:53,359 --> 01:53:54,951
Go... Go...

1484
01:53:57,497 --> 01:53:59,158
You've ruled this place tyrannically
for a long period.

1485
01:53:59,432 --> 01:54:00,694
I'll not allow your rule
here anymore.

1486
01:54:00,900 --> 01:54:01,662
Go to my mother... Go...

1487
01:54:07,574 --> 01:54:08,302
Mother stop.

1488
01:54:08,508 --> 01:54:10,100
Go and fall at my mother's feet.

1489
01:54:10,543 --> 01:54:12,408
Mother, please forgive me.
Please forgive me.

1490
01:54:12,612 --> 01:54:14,603
Stand up my daughter.
Let bygones be bygones.

1491
01:54:15,114 --> 01:54:18,208
Mother, I'm telling you the truth,
It was all...

1492
01:54:19,152 --> 01:54:21,916
Stop crying... and get
me tea immediately.

1493
01:54:22,288 --> 01:54:23,812
Wait child, I'll go and get it.

1494
01:54:24,023 --> 01:54:26,821
Where are you going?
Go and sit in your corner... Go...

1495
01:54:29,162 --> 01:54:29,924
Sit down.

1496
01:54:30,296 --> 01:54:31,490
Write Lord Ram.

1497
01:54:31,698 --> 01:54:32,665
Lord Ram.

1498
01:54:35,101 --> 01:54:36,762
Till now, I was subservient to her.

1499
01:54:36,970 --> 01:54:39,905
But now, she's the servant of
this Hukum Dass.

1500
01:54:40,173 --> 01:54:41,731
Father, you're mistaken.

1501
01:54:41,941 --> 01:54:45,104
Neither mother is your servant
nor you're mother's servant.

1502
01:54:45,311 --> 01:54:46,073
How's that?

1503
01:54:46,279 --> 01:54:48,110
If one follows other's advice,

1504
01:54:48,581 --> 01:54:50,378
Says Nanak, "Both will
became enlightened souls".

1505
01:54:50,717 --> 01:54:54,118
Father, wife and husband are like
wheels of a vehicle.

1506
01:54:54,320 --> 01:54:57,346
The way wheels carry the
entire weight of the vehicle equally,

1507
01:54:57,557 --> 01:55:02,392
If wife and husband also carry the
weight of family life equally,

1508
01:55:02,595 --> 01:55:04,324
Home will become heaven.

1509
01:55:05,331 --> 01:55:07,196
Mother... come here mother.

1510
01:55:07,901 --> 01:55:10,199
No no... I'll not come.

1511
01:55:10,737 --> 01:55:12,864
I must get punished for
my sins, Isn't it?

1512
01:55:14,374 --> 01:55:16,137
Father... please go.

1513
01:55:18,912 --> 01:55:20,846
My sweet father...

1514
01:55:31,057 --> 01:55:32,490
Please forgive me.

1515
01:55:32,692 --> 01:55:33,954
What are you doing?

1516
01:55:34,160 --> 01:55:36,287
Didn't you hear just now,
what did our son say?

1517
01:55:36,529 --> 01:55:38,463
If one follows the other's advice,

1518
01:55:38,665 --> 01:55:40,963
Says Nanak "Both will
become enlightened souls".

1519
01:55:41,167 --> 01:55:42,930
Come come Laju... come...

1520
01:55:47,006 --> 01:55:49,372
Now our home has become
heaven... heaven.

1521
01:55:49,575 --> 01:55:53,204
And son, it is all the
Grace of Lord Ram.

1522
01:55:53,780 --> 01:55:55,941
Ever since I visited his temple,

1523
01:55:56,149 --> 01:55:58,117
The dark clouds withered away.

1524
01:55:58,318 --> 01:55:59,683
And the brightness has
filled my life.

1525
01:55:59,919 --> 01:56:02,149
Come and join me in saying...

1526
01:56:02,355 --> 01:56:07,486
Hail Lord Ram...
Hail Lord Ram...

1527
01:56:14,467 --> 01:56:16,458
Any news about Chiranjeev?

1528
01:56:17,236 --> 01:56:18,669
You've changed a lot.

1529
01:56:19,005 --> 01:56:22,873
Earlier when he skipped lunch,
you would feel restless about it.

1530
01:56:23,142 --> 01:56:24,973
Now, he hasn't turned up
for 15 days.

1531
01:56:25,178 --> 01:56:26,805
And you're not concerned.

1532
01:56:27,213 --> 01:56:28,976
What's all this happening Sharda?

1533
01:56:29,849 --> 01:56:33,012
Before marriage, boy's responsibility
lies with parents.

1534
01:56:33,353 --> 01:56:35,253
After marriage, it's the responsibility
of the wife.

1535
01:56:35,588 --> 01:56:37,852
She'll manage him.

1536
01:56:38,057 --> 01:56:40,287
Manage him! How will I manage him?

1537
01:56:40,493 --> 01:56:43,326
Till he was here, she kept him
away from me.

1538
01:56:44,097 --> 01:56:47,157
She got us married but never
allowed us to settle down.

1539
01:56:47,633 --> 01:56:49,430
And now, she's accusing me.

1540
01:56:53,272 --> 01:56:56,036
Don't cry daughter-in-law,
you're going to be a mother soon.

1541
01:56:56,242 --> 01:56:58,005
Leave it.

1542
01:56:58,211 --> 01:56:59,940
One, you never allowed us
to get together.

1543
01:57:00,146 --> 01:57:02,273
Now, you're trying to
sympathise with me.

1544
01:57:02,882 --> 01:57:04,008
What are you saying
daughter-in-law?

1545
01:57:04,217 --> 01:57:06,651
Did I put a wedge between
you and your husband?

1546
01:57:06,853 --> 01:57:09,583
Why are you asking me?
Ask your heart?

1547
01:57:10,523 --> 01:57:12,991
Who'll be at loss in his absence?

1548
01:57:13,459 --> 01:57:15,484
I'll be all at sea.

1549
01:57:18,064 --> 01:57:19,190
Okay Daughter-in-law.

1550
01:57:19,799 --> 01:57:22,597
I'll bring back your husband
to you at any cost.

1551
01:57:24,470 --> 01:57:26,961
Please make arrangements
for our travel.

1552
01:57:29,275 --> 01:57:31,766
Did he tell you anything about the
place, where he's going?

1553
01:57:32,311 --> 01:57:37,613
I asked him persistantly, but
he didn't reply.

1554
01:57:39,452 --> 01:57:42,080
I could stop him forcibly.

1555
01:57:43,356 --> 01:57:47,315
That time, I was fighting with death myself.

1556
01:57:49,662 --> 01:57:52,222
Now, I'm on the brink of death.

1557
01:57:52,665 --> 01:57:53,825
Don't say like that brother.

1558
01:57:54,434 --> 01:57:56,197
God is merciful.

1559
01:57:58,738 --> 01:58:02,799
Had I followed your advice then,
I wouldn't have been in this position.

1560
01:58:04,310 --> 01:58:05,106
Well.

1561
01:58:05,711 --> 01:58:10,080
Leave it. I've had a good chance
of meeting you personally.

1562
01:58:10,450 --> 01:58:12,645
I couldn't reform myself in time.

1563
01:58:13,753 --> 01:58:16,881
But atleast, see that Shekhar's
life isn't ruined.

1564
01:58:18,291 --> 01:58:23,820
And bless me, so that
I've a peaceful death.

1565
01:58:25,665 --> 01:58:27,462
May God bless you with peace.

1566
01:58:42,448 --> 01:58:44,712
Brother, why did they come here?

1567
01:58:45,184 --> 01:58:46,344
Searching for Shekhar.

1568
01:58:46,552 --> 01:58:48,179
Searching for Shekhar?

1569
01:58:48,387 --> 01:58:50,014
She will definitely know
his whereabouts.

1570
01:58:50,223 --> 01:58:50,923
Who?

1571
01:58:51,124 --> 01:58:52,682
Sharda. Who else?

1572
01:58:52,892 --> 01:58:55,258
May be, she couldn't carry
on her affair at home.

1573
01:58:55,461 --> 01:58:57,122
That's why, she's now trying a new trick.

1574
01:58:59,165 --> 01:59:02,032
Why didn't you become dumb before
uttering such filth?

1575
01:59:02,869 --> 01:59:04,894
You didn't tell this to any
other people, Isn't it?

1576
01:59:05,238 --> 01:59:06,705
I've told Chanchal.

1577
01:59:07,673 --> 01:59:10,767
Oh! That's why he has run away
from the house.

1578
01:59:12,245 --> 01:59:15,874
What have you done? You've set
a happy home on fire!

1579
01:59:16,249 --> 01:59:18,547
You don't know what a great woman
Sharda is!

1580
01:59:18,751 --> 01:59:20,548
And what a great sacrifice
she has made.

1581
01:59:22,922 --> 01:59:25,550
I've committed a great blunder.
Please forgive me.

1582
01:59:25,758 --> 01:59:28,056
Don't ask forgiveness from me.
Go and ask that great woman.

1583
01:59:28,261 --> 01:59:29,888
Go and ask forgiveness from
that Great woman.

1584
01:59:30,763 --> 01:59:34,722
Brother... brother... brother...

1585
01:59:36,936 --> 01:59:55,276
Everyone will say I'll die before
getting afraid.

1586
01:59:57,790 --> 02:00:04,252
Even after death, if peace
is still elusive,

1587
02:00:06,299 --> 02:00:11,259
Where else to go?
They'll get reformed.

1588
02:00:12,305 --> 02:00:20,940
How much ever you may
run from life...

1589
02:00:21,647 --> 02:00:30,112
The fire in your heart will
never get extinguished.

1590
02:00:48,341 --> 02:01:01,311
Don't think only you're restless.
There is another side of the sorrow also.

1591
02:01:01,687 --> 02:01:14,657
This is the pain of love...
This is a black mark...

1592
02:01:15,034 --> 02:01:23,339
Open up and wake up...

1593
02:01:45,731 --> 02:01:50,031
Your life is a tale of dream.

1594
02:01:50,236 --> 02:01:54,536
You're the path and you're
the caravan.

1595
02:01:58,911 --> 02:02:03,371
This search is of memories
and a trap of mercy.

1596
02:02:12,258 --> 02:02:20,063
Don't run after the mirage...

1597
02:02:20,833 --> 02:02:30,799
It'll not be able to extinguish
the fire in your heart.

1598
02:02:44,290 --> 02:02:46,588
God, I've only one prayer.

1599
02:02:47,293 --> 02:02:49,090
Unite me with my Chiranjeev.

1600
02:03:30,503 --> 02:03:31,299
Mother!

1601
02:03:34,840 --> 02:03:35,540
Mother!

1602
02:03:36,842 --> 02:03:37,542
Son!

1603
02:03:57,463 --> 02:03:58,163
Son!

1604
02:04:05,371 --> 02:04:06,497
Father, what happened to him?

1605
02:04:07,206 --> 02:04:08,173
Brother, what happened to you?

1606
02:04:08,374 --> 02:04:10,001
Daughter-in-law, hold him,
I'll get water.

1607
02:04:10,209 --> 02:04:11,005
What happened to you?

1608
02:04:11,377 --> 02:04:12,173
Brother, what happened to you?

1609
02:04:12,378 --> 02:04:13,278
Father, what happened?

1610
02:04:14,547 --> 02:04:15,514
Daughter-in-law, be careful.

1611
02:04:15,714 --> 02:04:16,510
Brother, what happened?

1612
02:04:17,216 --> 02:04:17,916
Brother!

1613
02:04:26,892 --> 02:04:28,860
No need for you to take
any more trouble.

1614
02:04:29,061 --> 02:04:30,187
I'll take care of him myself.

1615
02:04:30,563 --> 02:04:31,860
Daughter-in-law, he's seriously ill!

1616
02:04:32,064 --> 02:04:32,860
I too know that.

1617
02:04:33,365 --> 02:04:34,065
Yes!

1618
02:04:34,066 --> 02:04:35,363
Go and get a Doctor!

1619
02:04:36,235 --> 02:04:37,702
Why are you looking at her? Go.

1620
02:04:37,903 --> 02:04:39,871
Go, - Yes madam.

1621
02:04:40,906 --> 02:04:41,702
Mother!

1622
02:04:42,575 --> 02:04:43,275
My son!

1623
02:04:44,743 --> 02:04:46,210
You're forgetting your promise.

1624
02:04:46,579 --> 02:04:49,377
I beg of you, daughter-in-law.

1625
02:04:49,582 --> 02:04:53,211
Release me from that promise,
Daughter-in-law.

1626
02:05:01,260 --> 02:05:01,960
Lord!

1627
02:05:03,596 --> 02:05:07,555
Lord, why am I being punished
like this?

1628
02:05:08,267 --> 02:05:12,226
Chiranjeev is here only and
I can't go near him.

1629
02:05:12,438 --> 02:05:16,397
Why did you snatch away the
opportunity of serving him?

1630
02:05:17,943 --> 02:05:18,643
Okay!

1631
02:05:20,112 --> 02:05:22,080
I too promise on your lotus feet.

1632
02:05:22,615 --> 02:05:24,583
Till Chiranjeev is fine,

1633
02:05:25,117 --> 02:05:27,085
I'll neither eat food
nor drink water.

1634
02:05:29,955 --> 02:05:32,583
What is this you've done?
You've taken a vow?

1635
02:05:33,459 --> 02:05:35,086
Please bless me,

1636
02:05:36,128 --> 02:05:38,255
That I will keep up my vow.

1637
02:06:35,020 --> 02:06:39,650
Mother... Mother... Mother...
Brother is calling you.

1638
02:06:39,858 --> 02:06:40,825
Mother, please come to him.

1639
02:06:41,193 --> 02:06:42,660
Get up, mother, come quickly.

1640
02:06:44,029 --> 02:06:45,155
Don't worry my children.

1641
02:06:45,864 --> 02:06:47,832
Your sister-in-law is with him.

1642
02:06:48,701 --> 02:06:50,669
Doctor is looking after him.

1643
02:06:50,869 --> 02:06:52,496
But he's calling you mother.

1644
02:06:54,373 --> 02:06:57,342
I can't come to him.
You go to him.

1645
02:06:57,543 --> 02:06:59,170
Mother, if you don't go to him,
we'll also not go to him.

1646
02:06:59,378 --> 02:07:03,007
Mother, come with us...
come with us...

1647
02:07:03,215 --> 02:07:05,513
Why are you irritating me?

1648
02:07:05,884 --> 02:07:07,852
I've told you, that I can't
go there.

1649
02:07:08,387 --> 02:07:09,354
Why can't you go there?

1650
02:07:12,725 --> 02:07:16,684
Is it your wish that he should
be longing to see you perpetually?

1651
02:07:17,229 --> 02:07:19,857
I want an answer, why are you
refusing to see him?

1652
02:07:21,900 --> 02:07:22,867
I want an answer!

1653
02:07:23,402 --> 02:07:24,369
Why don't you answer me?

1654
02:07:25,738 --> 02:07:26,705
I can't go.

1655
02:07:26,905 --> 02:07:28,532
Why? Why can't you go there?

1656
02:07:28,741 --> 02:07:31,539
I can't go! - Why can't you go?
Come on tell me, what's the matter?

1657
02:07:31,744 --> 02:07:33,712
Why can't you go there?
Come on, tell me.

1658
02:07:33,912 --> 02:07:34,708
Oh God!

1659
02:07:39,418 --> 02:07:41,386
I'm fine! I'm absolutely fine.

1660
02:07:42,087 --> 02:07:46,387
You go to Chiranjeev.
You go to Chiranjeev.

1661
02:08:54,526 --> 02:08:58,485
We've tried our level best.
Now everything is at God's mercy.

1662
02:09:06,505 --> 02:09:10,134
Mother, Doctor and sister-in-law say,
brother can't be saved from death.

1663
02:09:13,345 --> 02:09:15,142
Nothing will happen to
your brother.

1664
02:09:16,682 --> 02:09:19,981
Your brother will definitely be saved.
Definitely be saved.

1665
02:09:20,853 --> 02:09:22,150
How can his life be saved now?

1666
02:09:23,856 --> 02:09:25,824
Here you're adamant in
giving up your life,

1667
02:09:27,192 --> 02:09:28,489
There he's on the verge of death.

1668
02:09:28,694 --> 02:09:31,993
No, nothing untoward will happen
to my Chiranjeev.

1669
02:09:32,698 --> 02:09:35,826
What's left of him now?
Breathing is slowly going down.

1670
02:09:36,702 --> 02:09:37,669
Lips won't open.

1671
02:09:38,537 --> 02:09:39,237
But eyes...

1672
02:09:40,205 --> 02:09:41,832
But eyes... are resting
fixed on the door.

1673
02:09:42,875 --> 02:09:45,173
He's still awaiting your arrival.

1674
02:09:45,377 --> 02:09:47,174
My Chiranjeev will definitely
be saved.

1675
02:09:48,213 --> 02:09:49,840
You go to him.

1676
02:09:50,716 --> 02:09:55,847
My Chiranjeev will definitely be saved.
Will definitely be saved, saved.

1677
02:10:03,061 --> 02:10:04,688
Please forgive me!

1678
02:10:05,397 --> 02:10:07,024
I had committed a great sin
against you.

1679
02:10:08,066 --> 02:10:09,033
I did a blunder!

1680
02:10:09,568 --> 02:10:11,195
I falsely accused them.

1681
02:10:12,237 --> 02:10:13,704
She's as pure as the River Ganges.

1682
02:10:13,906 --> 02:10:15,203
What are you saying?

1683
02:10:15,908 --> 02:10:17,205
Yes Chanchal.

1684
02:10:27,753 --> 02:10:29,050
Son, do you want to go to
your mother?

1685
02:10:34,092 --> 02:10:36,060
Is it true? - Yes Chanchal.

1686
02:10:36,762 --> 02:10:38,730
Hey, brother told me from his
death bed,

1687
02:10:39,498 --> 02:10:40,522
And took a promise from me,

1688
02:10:41,099 --> 02:10:42,066
That I'll seek forgiveness
from you.

1689
02:10:42,935 --> 02:10:46,063
Please forgive me, I've oppressed
you a lot.

1690
02:10:46,772 --> 02:10:48,239
It was I who behaved oppressively.

1691
02:10:49,441 --> 02:10:51,739
I snatched away
a son from a mother.

1692
02:10:53,612 --> 02:10:55,580
How can I go now and
ask forgiveness?

1693
02:10:56,448 --> 02:10:59,576
Please accept my prayer, my Lord!
Please accept my prayer.

1694
02:10:59,785 --> 02:11:06,088
Mother, I've committed a great sin.
Please forgive me mother.

1695
02:11:07,626 --> 02:11:11,756
Mother! Please save my
husband's life.

1696
02:11:12,464 --> 02:11:14,932
Please save my husband's life.

1697
02:11:15,133 --> 02:11:16,930
Don't worry daughter-in-law
don't worry...

1698
02:11:17,469 --> 02:11:18,936
God will shower his mercy.

1699
02:11:19,638 --> 02:11:21,265
He has heard my prayers.

1700
02:11:21,473 --> 02:11:23,270
That's why you're here,

1701
02:11:23,609 --> 02:11:26,077
With me... before the God,

1702
02:11:26,311 --> 02:11:28,609
He'll never send you back
empty handed.

1703
02:11:29,314 --> 02:11:31,612
You've come here for you husband's life.
You'll live all your life with him.

1704
02:11:31,817 --> 02:11:32,517
Mother!

1705
02:12:01,680 --> 02:12:08,643
Five elements of the nature
are in one form.

1706
02:12:11,256 --> 02:12:17,855
Chanting of Lord Ram's name
will purify the soul.

1707
02:12:19,464 --> 02:12:25,096
His name is the medicine
for all ills.

1708
02:12:27,406 --> 02:12:33,367
Chant of Lord Ram's name
is the Ambrosia.

1709
02:13:15,253 --> 02:13:17,050
Mother!

1710
02:13:17,422 --> 02:13:18,389
Son!

1711
02:13:20,092 --> 02:13:20,792
My son!

1712
02:13:26,098 --> 02:13:29,556
You've given a new life
to your son.

1713
02:13:31,436 --> 02:13:34,064
This is a boon of mother nature.

1714
02:13:37,109 --> 02:13:40,408
Lord, you have answered my prayers.

1715
02:13:40,779 --> 02:13:42,246
Now let your vow be fulfilled.

1716
02:13:47,919 --> 02:14:10,139
You're one form, in many forms,
one form that's, ultimate truth.

1717
02:14:11,643 --> 02:14:18,276
You're beyond the mind and soul.

1718
02:14:18,817 --> 02:14:25,620
Chanting your name is the
embodiment of Lord Ram.

1719
02:14:26,324 --> 02:14:34,789
Lord Ram, chanting your name will bring
good and drive out the evil from men.

1720
02:14:44,176 --> 02:14:57,647
Lord Ram, I seek refuge in you.

1721
02:15:42,234 --> 02:15:46,534
Mother... Mother... Mother...

1722
02:15:49,908 --> 02:15:50,897
Don't cry daughter, I am so fortunate.

1723
02:15:52,277 --> 02:15:54,370
My wish is getting fulfilled.

1724
02:15:55,747 --> 02:15:58,375
As my eldest son, you must be
my pall bearer.

1725
02:16:02,921 --> 02:16:04,218
Mother, don't go away leaving me.

1726
02:16:05,924 --> 02:16:06,720
Don't go away...

1727
02:16:08,927 --> 02:16:11,054
What if this body disintegrates,

1728
02:16:12,931 --> 02:16:15,229
The soul will never disintegrate, Isn't it?

1729
02:16:16,268 --> 02:16:24,403
I'll come back... I'll come back...

1730
02:16:42,460 --> 02:16:45,361
And like this, chanting Lord Ram's
name, our mother left us.

1731
02:16:47,132 --> 02:16:48,258
This home became void.

1732
02:16:49,968 --> 02:16:51,765
Darkness engulfed our lives.

1733
02:16:53,972 --> 02:16:55,599
But I did remember mother's promise.

1734
02:16:57,309 --> 02:16:58,776
She said that she'll come back.

1735
02:17:00,145 --> 02:17:01,112
That she'll come back.

1736
02:17:01,646 --> 02:17:03,443
And she came back in this
girl's form.

1737
02:17:16,828 --> 02:17:17,954
Sister Sharda, where are you?

1738
02:17:19,998 --> 02:17:21,124
Mother... come...

1739
02:17:26,504 --> 02:17:29,302
Sister Sharda, please forgive me.
I came little late.

1740
02:17:29,674 --> 02:17:32,302
What can I also do, mother doesn't
finish her prayers quickly.

1741
02:17:32,510 --> 02:17:33,977
And children's mother doesn't get
respite from their chores.

1742
02:17:36,181 --> 02:17:39,275
We feel happy looking at
her like this,

1743
02:17:39,884 --> 02:17:41,351
And time flies past.

1744
02:17:42,754 --> 02:17:45,917
Even now our mother is still
in our home.
