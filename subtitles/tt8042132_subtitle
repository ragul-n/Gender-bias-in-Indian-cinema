Sir, go back.

11
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,400
Move away.

12
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,320
It's not necessary
to take this knife.

13
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,360
It's you who decide
whether to take that or not?

14
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,720
Have you seen there?

15
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,640
That's a permitted pistol
and it's fully loaded

16
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,680
 Do you know, I can shoot you
citing that you tried to stab me?

17
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,760
Sir, do that.

18
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,480
Instead of dying every day,
that's a better solution.

19
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,720
If we're to die and to kill,
then humans won't exist in this world.

20
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,000
What's happening now, sir?

21
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,440
Are they humans?

22
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,160
You're speaking well.

23
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,360

24
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,000
Are you heeding
when we say louder?

25
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,720
You heed only
when we take the knife.

26
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,520
We got the Independence
without arms.

27
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:56,080
People like you, the officers
and the politicians have enslaved us.

28

Where do we've Independence?

29
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,880
First, drop the knife.

00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,400
I'll sort out the problem
whatever it is.

31
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,280
Do you want me
to believe the police?

32
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,040
Why everyone thinks bad
about the police personnel?

00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,920
I'm the police man
who pays rent every month...

You can believe me.

36
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,360
Drop the knife.

00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,880

Who will take care of her?

Aravind.

42
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:50,720
My auto was seized,
citing the interest I had to pay.

43
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,920
No one was there to support me,
when I went to take back the auto.

44
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,880
My life depends on the auto.

45
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,680
You'll get back your vehicle.

46
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,440
I am responsible for that.

47
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,840
You can go home.

48
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,000
- Aravind.
- Sir.

49
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,600
- Don't file any report.
- Sir.

50
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,920
- Close the case mentioning my name.
- Okay, sir.

51
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,200
Tell me.

52
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,000
Which place?

53
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,920
Okay, I'll come.

54
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,440
- Clear off before the press arrives.
- Okay, sir.

55
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,440
Don't forget to take
the blood sample.

56
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:49,800
The PP tore me out
in the last case.

57
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,880
- The incident time.
- 2 o'clock, sir.

58
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,680
- The reporting time
- 3.15, sir.

59
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,840
- Note the disposal time as 4 o'clock.
- Okay, sir.

60
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,120
Check for any other impressions.

61
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,840
Siva, found anything?

62
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,880
There was no footprints on the wall.

63
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,760
She has jumped from above.

64
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,840
- Send me the report soon.
- Okay, sir

65
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,880
Sir, greetings!

66
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,120
- Will the terrace be open always?
- Yes, sir.

67
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,480
Didn't hear any sound upon falling?

68
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,800
Not heard, sir.

69
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,880
Isn't there CCTV cameras
in this big flat?

70
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,800
Maintenance fee is not given regularly.

71
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,520
Even I was paid my salary long back.

72
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,160
How to install the CCTV?

73
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,560
Yes, sir.

74
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,720
At Nandambakkam.

75
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,280
A Woman.
Fallen from high.

76
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,080
I am inquiring, sir.

77
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,920
I'll call you after the enquiry.

78
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,080
Thank you, sir.

79
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,280
Get the necessary information
from him.

80
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:58,920
Okay sir.

81
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,240
And ensure that it reaches me tonight.

82
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,680
- What's your name?
- Muralidharan.

83
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,920
We've informed her husband.

84
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,200
He is on the way.

85
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,760
She doesn't have children.

86
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,200
How long she has been married?

87
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,080
- Don't know about that, sir
- It's been eight years.

88
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,520
Just now they celebrated their
eighth anniversary.

89
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,800
How about their relationship?

90
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,200
They were good.

91
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,280
What good?

92
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,080
Even last night they were quarrelling.

93
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,440
The noise was audible.

94
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:22,920
She'll always be busy on phone
And he'll be shouting at her.

95
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:27,000
She is active in
a group in WhatsApp.

96
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,960
That group is...
"Inauspicious pooja time"

97
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,360
Sir, her age is twenty eight.

98
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,680
Married for about seven years.

99
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,800
She doesn't have children.

100
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,760
Last night both husband
and wife quarrelled.

101
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,640
The motive?

102
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,560
Don't know, sir.

103
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,640
There is no death note.

104
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,800
But, the mobile phone is missing.

105
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,480
The last active network shows here.

106
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:45,520
Go to the hospital and
share the postmortem report.

107
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:48,480
Sir, today evening
we've a public welfare meeting.

108
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,560
That's okay.

109
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,280
The Commissioner will lash out,
if we don't attain the target.

110
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,600
Send the SI to the hospital.

111
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,280
Okay, sir.

112
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:57,400
In general, people will be proud of
saying, I didn't step into the police station.

113
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:01,240
The police station is not
such a worst place to step in.

114
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:04,800
As you hesitate to come to us,
We've come in search of you.

115
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:09,360
In a dense populated zone,
a Police Inspector, four sub-inspectors...

116
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,440
 ...a writer, the head Constable
and constables together,

117
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,240
 Some forty personnel will be there.

118
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:17,880
The public awareness is more important
than the police to get rid of the miscreants.

119
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:22,160
To create such an awareness,
we conduct the public welfare meeting...

120
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,680
...regularly in every zone.

121
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,160
If you follow the basic safety measures
mentioned by the SI,

122
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,640
You can get rid of the petty crimes
happening in your zone.

123
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,840
Moreover, now we're all together.

124
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,360
But, we live alone.

125
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,840
Earlier, we aren't aware of the neighbour.

126
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:42,240
Now, we don't know
who is sitting next to us in home.

127
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,080
We're engaged with
the mobile phones.

128
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,040
Like her...

129
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,880
I'm listening, sir.

130
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,400
If anyone is new to the village,

131
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,560
 People will inquire him
and get his entire details.

132
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,320
But, see how we're here.

133
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,200
It's been an hour,
a woman has fallen from the terrace.

134
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:05,840
As no one noticed her, she died.

135
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,680
- Where?
- Don't know.

136
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,640
Nehru Nagar.
It's family dispute.

137
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,640
You go in search of
an organic recipe.

138
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,120
It's good if the human relationship
is also organic.

139
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,760
It has become late.

140
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,240
There won't be food in home.

141
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,280
I'll buy and keep it.

142
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,680
Brother, I'm yet to face that situation.

143
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,960
Get for you.

144
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,480
Why did you take
bath so early?

145
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:43,360
I felt tired as I went out
with my husband.

146
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,600
That's why, I took bath.

147
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,040
A suicide case.

148
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,960
A woman fell from the terrace,
due to family dispute.

149
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,320
She is dignified.

150
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:54,960
Fell off.

151
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:59,760
The height of the terrace
is not enough here.

152
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,200
Hey...

153
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,800
I'm tensed from morning onwards.

154
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:14,000
Being at home, are you creating
ruckus watching soap operas?

155
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,840
No peace of mind at home.

156
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,800
Aravind, got the autopsy report?

157
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,760
Send by WhatsApp, immediately.

158
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,080
What?

159
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,720
Wastrel.

160
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:31,520
"One day, the rain made
me feel better"

161
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:36,280
"I was seduced by it"

162
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:40,840
"The holy day, when the wave
hit the shore"

163
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:45,960
"I lost my mind,"

164
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:53,080
"It's a blissful day,
the day I saw you at first"

165
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:58,680
"In the wings of your eyes,"

166
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,680
"Bestowed on you"

167
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:04,680
"In my heart..."

168
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:10,160
"You're my desire and temper
from then on"

169
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:15,040
"You nest even in my anger"

170
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:19,960
"My dear, you're someone...
I relished with you"

171
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:24,760
"One day, the rain made
me feel better"

172
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:29,600
"I was seduced by it"

173
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:34,520
"The holy day, when the wave
hit the shore"

174
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:38,880
"I lost my mind,"

175
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:20,360
"Without seeing your beautiful face"

176
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,920
"Without asking anything"

177
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:27,760
"I have become something today"

178
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:32,520
"Without the graze,
without the kiss"

179
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:37,440
"Why did you keep me yearning?"

180
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:42,280
"The pains are mine...
The eyes are mine..."

181
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:47,120
"What's the mystery?"

182
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,680
"It's your mind..."

183
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,960
"The oblivion is your's"

184
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,720
"The death is mine"

185
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:01,480
"The clouds escalate,
the sky beholds"

186
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:06,840
"Will the moon go around?"

187
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,840
Go carefully.

188
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,480
- Bye, mom.
- Bye.

189
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:24,320
Hey, how long will you sleep?
Will you wake up or not?

190
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,720
Take it easy, sister.
Let her sleep.

191
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,720
She's a child.

192
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,480
- Why are you being harsh with her?
- Okay.

193
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:31,200
Daughters can sleep peacefully
only at mother's home.

194
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,800
- Okay.
- Fine.

195
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,600
Check whether all clothes
are there.

196
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,840
- Oh no.
- Hey.

197
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,040
Hey, my chain!

198
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:39,720
Hey.

199
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,080
Dare to snatch the Inspector
wife's chain?

200
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,760
Hey! You're finished.

201
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,400
Wastrels.

202
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,320
- Here.
- Thank you.

203
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,680
Nuptial thread isn't seen.

204
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,560
It's in the home.

205
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,800
Brother

206
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:09,920
Greetings, Madam!

207
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:15,480
You show off as if you're working and
not even bothering your family.

208
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,840
But, the Inspector wife's chain
was snatched in the morning.

209
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,160
Who and where?

210
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,120
- Near the laundry.
- You mean, near the laundry?

211
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:21,760
What?

212
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,960
Someone has snatched madam's chain.

213
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,080
Is it?

214
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,480
What happened?

215
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,920
Inquire who is that.

216
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:31,880
 We'll be back.

217
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,320
Is he your friend?

218
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,800
He dropped the chain
when said as Inspector's wife.

219
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,880
Nothing happened to you, right?

220
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,160
If the violence is outside,
I can complaint to the police.

221
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,760
But, whom to complaint about
the violence in this family?

222
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,480
What happened now?

223
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,120
You arranged our marriage.

224
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,640
He takes alcohol every day.

225
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,520
Won't you ask him?

226
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,280
Men have lot of problems.

227
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,400
How will you understand?

228
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,520
You say as domestic violence...

229
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,680
Do you know the statistics
of the crime bureau?

230
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:01,160
Men commit suicide twice more than
women because of domestic violence.

231
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,520
Have coffee and go.

232
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,520
Don't you know about men?

233
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,320
They'll cut the bunch
if you ask them to get a leaf.

234
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,000
Drinking has become a routine
instead of once in a week.

235
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,200
My wife knows that I booze.

236
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,960
If I booze before her
she will thrash me.

237
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,160
You too handle him
the same way.

238
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,480
Sir, I'm coming.

239
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,160
What she said?

240
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,680
She was worried.

241
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:47,480
I told her that he might've done
because of tiredness.

242
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,560
So, get adjusted.

243
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,640
I told her.

244
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,080
I really told her.

245
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,600
Take the vehicle.

246
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:00,800
 Hello.

247
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,320
What happened?

248
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:04,040
You're not in contact?

249
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,160
I'm here.

250
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,880
What's the problem today?

251
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,600
Has any day passed
without a problem?

252
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,520
He takes alcohol everyday
citing as stress.

253
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:22,120
But, we've to get up in the morning,
Do all the house hold chores.

254
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,840
We shouldn't have any stress
and keep smiling...

255
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,720
...like the goddess
in the daily calendar.

256
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:30,640
You too have a peg like them,
if you feel stressed.

257
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,280
Really, I'm going to do that.

258
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,160
Shall I send you the side dish?

259
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,040
I have.

260
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,600
But, don't have a company.

261
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,840
Will you join me?

262
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,880
It's time to go to clinic.

263
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,600
I must leave.

264
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,560
Bye.

265
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,000
"I got the money"

266
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,240
"I got the move"

267
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,600
"You got the smile"

268
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,000
"You got the cues"

269
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:28,480
"Rolling through the darkness at night"

270
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,720
"I got the money"

271
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,200
"I got the move"

272
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,480
"You got the smile"

273
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:35,920
"You got the cues"

274
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,080
"Rolling through the darkness at night"

275
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:46,000
"Enticer, you're doing some magic"

276
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:51,440
"You're coming to splatter
colours in my life again"

277
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:56,800
"You're healing the wound
which kills me"

278
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:02,400
"You're becoming my other half of life"

279
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:07,680
"On that day, you came in my dreams"

280
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:12,760
"I thought you're an illusion..."

281
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:18,440
"Today, you came before me..."

282
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:24,720
"And say you're real..."

283
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,480
Courier.

284
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,160
Sign?

285
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,640
It was outside.

286
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:48,960
Sorry, I didn't notice.

287
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,400
You seem to stay indoors.

288
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,240
You'll know,
only when you come out.

289
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,560
You?

290
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,080
I saw an advertisement in OLX
about the vacant house here.

291
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,240
No one is at home now.

292
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,200
You're here!

293
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,560
Aren't you the owner?

294
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,080
He'll come only by evening.

295
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,320
You seem to be more dependent.

296
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:10,240
Give me your number
if you want the house.

297
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,720
I'll ask him to call you.

298
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,400
I'm not using a mobile phone.

299
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,400
No one believes, if I say.

300
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:19,960
Better, give me your number
I'll call you and come.

301
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:22,280
I won't give the number
to strangers.

302
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,040
Will you give
if I've an Aadhar card?

303
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,200
Come in the evening.

304
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:30,880
Sorry.

305
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:34,680
The bass is high in the music system.

306
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,720
If you reduce that
the audio quality will be good.

307
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,920
I'll come in the evening.

308
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:45,360
"You the enticer"

309
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:57,080
Dear, some sound was heard, isn't it?

310
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,240
Dear...

311
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,360
- What?
- Heard some sound.

312
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,760
The cat would've rolled down
something

313
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,640
It sounds different.

314
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,240
Did you hear any sound?

315
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,560
Nothing.

316
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,640
Hey, look there.

317
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,160
(chatter)

318
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,880
It's similar to
the yesterday's incident, isn't it?

319
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:35,840
Yes, sir.

320
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:37,800
When will you clear off?

321
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,040
Coming, sir.

322
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,320
Who is he?

323
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,960
Her husband.

324
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,520
She is the one who was busy
on the phone yesterday.

325
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,640
She fell in the similar way.

326
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,920
CCTV cameras was shut down
in the apartments.

327
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,040
What happened to her phone?

328
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,000
We found it, sir.

329
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,800
But, it was locked by pattern.

330
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,200
Open the lock immediately.

331
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,480
Send me all the details.

332
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,400
Okay, sir.

333
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,560
Sir, that girl's husband,
he wasn't here when she fell.

334
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,760
Come here.

335
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,080
What's your name?

336
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,480
Aryan, sir.

337
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,520
How long have you been married?

338
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:13,680
Six years.

339
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,200
Who saw first,
when she fell down?

340
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,840
The laundry man.

341
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,000
Shall I get him?

342
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,200
Yeah, get him.

343
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:35,480
You too saw her yesterday,
always busy on phone.

344
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,440
She'll go only to gym.

345
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,800
A brave girl.

346
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:41,480
But, who knows about their decisions!

347
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,680
They are childless.

348
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:45,480
Both their relationship is not good.

349
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,680
Sir, look here.

350
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,720
Who's dairy is this?

351
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,120
It's her's.

352
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:55,760
This is also 174.

353
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,400
I have a small doubt, sir.

354
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,480
What's that?

355
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,880
There was a scratch in the hand
of the woman who died yesterday.

356
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:04,400
There is a phrase 'Yolo'
in this girl's hand.

357
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:08,720
And, there is a blue whale
sketch in her dairy.

358
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,800
A collection of horror movies
in the laptop.

359
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,400
All these are the tasks of the game.

360
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:19,840
Last task of that game is to
commit suicide falling from the terrace.

361
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:23,320
Don't share with anyone
unless confirmed.

362
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,120
Okay, I'll call back.

363
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:36,640
Hello.

364
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,680
I'm on leave.

365
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,280
When do we have leave?

366
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,600
Just two or three months.

367
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,040
Then, who'll leave you?

368
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:45,360
You'll be the head of Crime Branch.

369
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,600
What happened?

370
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,040
Two suicides consecutively.

371
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,720
I think the motive must be big.

372
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,400
Your guys are there, isn't it?

373
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,840
Yeah, but we need
an expert's opinion?

374
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,120
Will you come or not?

375
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,400
When have you given a choice
to the policeman?

376
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,960
- Which zone?
- Adambakkam.

377
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,480
Ganapathy is there.

378
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,120
What can I do?

379
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:06,040
Both of them are
married young women.

380
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,040
I'll send you the order.

381
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,280
Attend the case.

382
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,640
- Park there.
- Okay, sir.

383
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,920
Sir, AC George.

384
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,720
DC has sent him
to handle the case.

385
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,360
Are we sitting here idle?

386
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,240
Sir...

387
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,080
Where is the corpse?

388
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,160
It's in the mortuary.

389
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:43,640
This way, sir.

390
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,560
How old is she?

391
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,600
She is twenty seven years.

392
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:47,840
Your age?

393
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,200
Thirty years, sir.

394
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,240
Kalidas!

395
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,280
How are you called?

396
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,440
Whether Kali or das?

397
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,280
Das...

398
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,440
Sir, take left.

399
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,760
Heard about the yesterday's incident.

400
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,360
That too is a suicide case.

401
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,320
Not that, about the knife incident.

402
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,120
Sir, this way.

403
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,240
DC told me.

404
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:06,920
It's a good thing.

405
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:11,320
Let the public know that
our heart beats the same.

406
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,760
Have you took any video
of the incident?

407
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:13,400
No, sir.

408
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,760
To post in the Facebook?

409
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,160
Don't take all these.

410
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:21,480
But, you'll take a video and replay
if the police hits someone.

411
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,000
Bunch of jokers.

412
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,160
This way.

413
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:25,600
Sir, here.

414
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,080
Hey, are you here?

415
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,200
Greetings, sir.

416
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,480
Yes, sir.

417
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,400
Hi.

418
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:30,960
Hello, sir.

419
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,200
Are you looking after this case?

420
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,200
I'm on deputation.

421
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,560
Do you have something for me?

422
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,680
One second, sir...

423
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,760
Nail scraps.

424
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:48,640
We think killing is the
biggest punishment for a person.

425
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,080
Actually, it's a freedom.

426
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:52,040
Sir, it's a suicide.

427
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,480
Das, how are you willing to die?

428
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:56,320
Sir.

429
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,920
I mean, in which method?

430
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,360
Sir, in my sleep...

431
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,280
Isn't that boring?

432
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,040
We're going to die
only once.

433
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:06,680
Won't that be good,
if bit exciting?

434
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,120
Sir, she...

435
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,600
Like a plane crash...

436
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,360
Exciting like that.

437
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,360
Sir, these are their reports.

438
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,720
Both fell from height.

439
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:22,640
Did they jump?

440
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,560
Or pushed by someone?

441
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:27,240
Sir, as it's a suicide,
they must've jumped.

442
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,680
Blue whale?

443
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,000
Have you read this report?

444
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,560
That's why, I'm saying, sir.

445
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,360
Where is the scene of crime
of this girl?

446
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,000
- Singham...
- Sir...

447
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,320
Capture the marks in the wall.

448
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,400
Okay, sir.

449
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,800
This cement crap is found
from the dead girl's nail.

450
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:01,000
If she wants to commit suicide,
she won't crap the walls.

451
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:01,960
Sir,

452
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:02,800
Did you find it?

453
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,480
We opened the pattern lock of phone.

454
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:06,040
 Here is the details, sir.

455
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,040
Sir...

456
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:11,480
The girl had blue whale game
in her mobile.

457
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:15,080
 Only today, all the images related to
that game has been deleted.

458
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:18,040
But, we got a evidence in that image.

459
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,760
In one of the image,
the girl's leg is shot on upstairs.

460
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:21,920
So?

461
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:24,280
While taking a selfie,
she might've fallen.

462
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,840
Sir, the secretary of this flats.

463
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:26,800
Hello, sir.

464
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,360
What about the CCTV footage?

465
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,040
From morning onwards,
there was power rip problem.

466
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,200
Just now, we've checked.

467
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,960
Is it only when the girl had fallen?

468
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,200
It happens, often.

469
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:37,200
We've informed the SI
in yesterday's meeting.

470
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:40,960
Why CCTV cameras didn't work
when particular incident happened?

471
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:45,240
Unfortunately, it might be a coincidence.

472
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:59,640
Sir,

473
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,200
Sir has come.

474
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,400
Sir...

475
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:05,720
Recently, you know that a girl
has fallen to death.

476
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,760
Since morning,
I've been staying only here.

477
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,080
She is an innocent.

478
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:12,440
Was there any new person in the flats
when the girl fell down?

479
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,560
I can't see clearly
due to vision problem.

480
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,880
But, I heard the bullet sound.

481
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:23,480
This is the CCTV camera
of younger generation.

482
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:27,440
You belong to the generation who forgot
the tables because of the calculators.

483
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:35,440
This is the first woman
suicide case, sir.

484
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,560
Exactly, she was on the top of it.

485
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,280
Singham, come here.

486
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,240
Sir...

487
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,240
Climb up.

488
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:47,000
Sir...

489
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,000
Climb up.

490
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,440
Okay, sir.

491
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,120
Jump from there.

492
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,640
Sir, I'm scared.

493
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,560
Jump.

494
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,960
Brother, turn back and jump.

495
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:29,520
That girl had jumped
only from the stool.

496
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:30,240
Yes, sir.

497
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:33,480
If she had jumped from there,
She would've fallen upside down.

498
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,120
 If someone had pushed her
from here...

499
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,040
 ...due to angular motion,
she would've fallen upside down.

500
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,680
Wasn't this the position
she was found?

501
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:39,360
Yes, sir.

502
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,240
There was no footprint marks
on the wall.

503
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,280
Come up.

504
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,080
Aravind, put a cross mark on it.

505
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,560
Ganesh, hold his legs.

506
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:51,640
Go

507
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:59,520
There is no need for
someone to push.

508
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,760
For this fifty feet height,

509
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,800
Though the girl would've jumped
from the stool.

510
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,360
By angular motion...

511
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:06,280
...she has fallen upside down
due to her body weight.

512
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:09,480
There is no chance
of foot prints on the wall.

513
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:13,760
Okay.

514
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,120
Where is her husband?

515
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,920
Where is your wife's mobile phone?

516
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,680
Sir, I don't know.

517
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:21,720
She uses her phone
only to make calls and nothing else.

518
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,840
 The day before she died,
you both were quarrelling.

519
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,800
Not a day has passed
without quarrelling?

520
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:27,760
We don't have children.

521
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:30,120
 My mother called me
which she doesn't like...

522
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,520
...that made her to quarrel
with me.

523
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,280
But, I was told something differently.

524
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,760
What's that?

525
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:37,240
You're unfit. That's why, both
were indulged in quarrelling.

526
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:41,480
These people will convey,
what they are interested in.

527
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,760
I took care of her
like a child.

528
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:46,680
Instead of impregnating,
he took care of her like a child.

529
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,880
This is what will happen.

530
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,720
Does anyone have
a bullet in this flats?

531
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:52,840
Not now, sir.

532
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,360
Two months before a guy
had a bullet.

533
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,680
 But, he vacated the house.

534
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,640
The beads look beautiful.

535
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,440
I didn't say,
I'll rent you the house.

536
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,120
In the morning...

537
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:16,840
...when I saw your face,
I thought you will.

538
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:17,680
That's why...

539
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:20,440
You said that you aren't
the owner of this house.

540
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,600
Did you close the EMI's?

541
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:26,480
Because, till the loan gets closed
the banker is the owner of the house.

542
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,560
That's why, I asked you.

543
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:30,880
Whether the EMI is closed or not
you've to pay the rent only to me.

544
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,640
With or without GST?

545
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:33,440
I'm not renting you the house.

546
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,440
You can leave.

547
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,040
Hello, please wait.

548
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:41,520
If you can't decide
about renting the house,

549
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:42,960
Then, why do you deny?

550
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,880
 Ask him and say.

551
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:52,520
 Hi...

552
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,680
 Hi...

553
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:54,880
Come here.

554
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,920
Mom.

555
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:14,480
Speak now.

556
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:17,840
Yes, tell me.

557
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:20,280
A person has come asking
the first floor room for rent.

558
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,960
What are you going to do by
renting out that now?

559
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,920
They said the house shouldn't
be kept locked.

560
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,240
Who said so?

561
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,720
My friends at parlour.

562
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,080
You've decided everything on your own.

563
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,560
 Why are you asking me?

564
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:33,600
 I've lots of problem.
Don't call me and irritate.

565
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,080
Hang up the phone.

566
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,520
Was the call from your wife?

567
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:41,640
Yes, sir.

568
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,520
Is it a love marriage
or an arranged marriage?

569
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,880
It's a love marriage, sir.

570
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,960
Did both the families
accept your marriage?

571
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,360
We eloped and got married.

572
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:54,240
When you both quarrel,
there is no one to be blamed.

573
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:57,080
So, you keep blaming each other.

574
00:38:57,160 --> 00:39:00,640
You stay calm to the person,
who assigns the work

575
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:04,840
...but why are you getting angry
with your life partner?

576
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,040
How many people will stay here?

577
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:11,480
It's me only.

578
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,800
If you come home late night,

579
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,400
You should jump over the wall.

580
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:16,200
I won't come in the night.

581
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,360
Why?

582
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,920
Are you selling kulfi ice cream?

583
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,720
Oh, is it a joke?

584
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,600
Try better than this.

585
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:24,680
Are you a night watch man?

586
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,920
No, I'm a night beggar.

587
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,560
You'll rent me the house, right?

588
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:31,320
Will you pay the rent as coins?

589
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:33,720
In this digital India,
we've only online payment.

590
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:38,280
Oh, no! I've to rethink of
renting out the house to you.

591
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,560
Open the door.

592
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,680
So, what's your job, really?

593
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,080
I'm a DJ in a club.

594
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:00,240
You're enjoying your work
like night parties.

595
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:01,760
Nothing like that.

596
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:04,600
When everyone is happy as a clan,

597
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:07,000
I'll be alone in a corner at the party,
that's my job.

598
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,040
It's hard to be alone.

599
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:14,120
Will you bring girls to the house
to get rid of loneliness?

600
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,040
No...

601
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:18,480
 I've a moral line on girl's issue.

602
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:26,160
You said that you
don't have a phone.

603
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:29,360
No, it's my programme
coordinator's phone.

604
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:31,680
He gave his phone not believing me.

605
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,360
He is afraid that I may escape.

606
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:52,920
Come on, sir.

607
00:40:58,680 --> 00:40:59,920
He is the Assistant Commissioner.

608
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:00,880
Hello, sir.

609
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,520
Something for you

610
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:05,640
Why this?

611
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:06,760
Come in, sir.

612
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:14,560
Everyone said that you'll prepare
a good coffee.

613
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:15,800
That's why,
I came here.

614
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,120
You're lying.

615
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,560
No coffee for me?

616
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,400
There is no milk.

617
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,400
I'm okay with black coffee.

618
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,160
Okay.

619
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,240
Have you bought this house
with your earnings?

620
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,680
It's my grandfather's gift for
my marriage.

621
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:49,000
Wow!

622
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:50,720
Who painted this one?

623
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:51,880
It's done by Madam.

624
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:54,360
She did a course on painting.

625
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:56,080
Thank you.

626
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:57,960
This is beautiful!

627
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:59,200
Thank you.

628
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,720
Black coffee is good for health.

629
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:27,520
We're spoiling the coffee by
using milk.

630
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,120
Thank you.
We're leaving now.

631
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,920
Why are you leaving soon?

632
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:37,440
We're on duty.
We've to go.

633
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:40,600
Next time,
come with your family.

634
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:41,560
Yes, sure.

635
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,440
At least to have coffee,

636
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:44,720
 You take care.

637
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:45,720
Okay.

638
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:56,560
What is her name?

639
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:57,600
Sir, Vidhya.

640
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:01,320
I can understand a woman's feeling
by the way she keeps her home.

641
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:03,120
She maintains the house beautiful.

642
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,960
It's great to be a wife
of the Police officer.

643
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:08,560
Take care of her.

644
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,560
These are the mobile numbers
of the dead women.

645
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:36,640
You're not speaking properly
to your wife.

646
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:40,360
Have you exchanged these words
when in love?

647
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:49,240
Sir, we got the recordings of
phone dump of those two women.

648
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:52,560
Totally, there is no connection
between them.

649
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:56,640
 Don't know about the motivation
of the murder.

650
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,760
Whatever, you give a logical reasoning
for this case.

651
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:01,960
Thirty five years of experience
doesn't accept that it's a suicide.

652
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:03,960
Come.

653
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:04,720
Sir.

654
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:07,120
The dead woman's father.

655
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:08,800
Get in.

656
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:09,800
Come here.

657
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:12,000
Be seated.

658
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:16,080
My daughter was killed.

659
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:17,000
Who is that?

660
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:18,400
 My son-in-law.

661
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:21,400
 He cheated her with seven years
of age difference.

662
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:23,840
 My daughter wasn't happy
after her marriage.

663
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:27,480
I brought her up well
but got her married to a wrong person.

664
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:29,320
Look at this.

665
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:35,320
This is my daughter's.

666
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:37,640
When they were quarrelling,
he had broken it.

667
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:39,680
Uncle, what are you doing here?

668
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:40,760
First, go home.

669
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,000
Who are you to
ask him to go?

670
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:44,680
Please, ask him to wait outside
for ten minutes.

671
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:46,720
Uncle, wait outside for few minutes.

672
00:44:58,240 --> 00:44:59,200
What's this?

673
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:01,480
It was her's.

674
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:03,000
Why did you break this?

675
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:04,840
I didn't do that.

676
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:15,960
Hey, whose phone is this?

677
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:17,840
It's Malini's phone.
She gave me.

678
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:18,680
It's her's.

679
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,280
Why she gave
her phone to you?

680
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:20,880
 Give me.

681
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:21,560
I want to see.

682
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:23,280
She went out.

683
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:25,160
That's why she asked
to keep with me.

684
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:26,320
What was there?

685
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:27,600
'Miss you'

686
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:28,600
What?

687
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:30,240
'Miss you'

688
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:31,560
This is her phone.

689
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:33,280
 Anyone might send her,
'Miss you'.

690
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:34,280
 What can I do for it?

691
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:35,120
Give me the phone.

692
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:36,080
- I won't.
- Give me.

693
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:36,880
I won't give you.

694
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:38,000
Are you dubious?

695
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:39,680
- Give now.
- I won't give.

696
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:42,080
You can't take care of me.

697
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:43,800
Are you suspecting me?

698
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:45,520
Are you suspecting me?

699
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:50,480
I took the broken phone
to the service center.

700
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:53,480
But, they said they can't
unlock the pattern.

701
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:56,280
We can do it, sir.

702
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,280
That's it.

703
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,600
Sir, we got the number.

704
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:31,920
Sir, this phone belongs to him
not mine.

705
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:33,080
Hey, come here

706
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:37,960
Go

707
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:39,200
Go

708
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:42,680
You saved my life, sir.

709
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:45,720
Yesterday, you showed your frustration
over someone, upon me.

710
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:47,360
 I got frustrated.

711
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:48,520
Please, apologize me.

712
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:49,400
 If you aren't there,

713
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:52,280
These policemen would've closed
the case stating...

714
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:53,840
...that I pushed the woman from upstairs.

715
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:54,480
Sir.

716
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:55,520
Idiot.

717
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:59,200
Hey, what is your name?

718
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:00,200
Arav.

719
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:01,280
Arav.

720
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:02,960
How you know she was pushed?

721
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:04,360
How could she jump?

722
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:07,880
She would've been pushed by someone
else, she won't jump from there.

723
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:10,120
How do you know his wife?

724
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:12,160
I know, sir.

725
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:15,200
But, from yesterday morning onwards,
I'm in the prison.

726
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:17,160
How did you befriend his wife?

727
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:23,600
Sir, please wait outside.

728
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:26,960
 Sir, wait outside.
I'll call you.

729
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:29,520
Okay sir.

730
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:33,160
Hey,

731
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:34,760
Sir.

732
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:35,720
Tell me, now.

733
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:38,520
I'll die,
if you hit me again.

734
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:40,240
I'll say everything to you.

735
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:42,600
Even if I remember the incidents
of previous birth, I'll tell.

736
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:44,360
I met her in the gym.

737
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:46,000
We were chatting in the group.

738
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:48,480
Later on,
we were chatting in privacy.

739
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:51,520
 After speaking a lot,
we loved each other.

740
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:53,880
When her husband took the phone,

741
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:56,160
I was speaking to her directly.

742
00:47:57,560 --> 00:47:58,320
Come inside.

743
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:02,120
 Whenever I come,
she'll switch off the CCTV camera.

744
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:03,280
CCTV camera?

745
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:04,640
I've switched it off.

746
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:08,200
As per time table,
I should go there, today.

747
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:10,400
But, he has saved me.

748
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:12,960
Why did you come inside?

749
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,680
 Priya was chatting similarly.

750
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:18,920
 I bought her a dress
and went home.

751
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,360
Only then, I was aware
that's not Priya.

752
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:22,280
 He is Priyadharsan.

753
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:23,880
 Her husband.

754
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:34,720
Tell me.

755
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:37,240
A new tenant has come upstairs.

756
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:39,200
Why suddenly?

757
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:41,200
The room was locked for long days.

758
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:43,920
What Das has said?

759
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:45,200
What he says?

760
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:46,920
Do whatever you want.

761
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:49,960
If he comes home,
even I'm not visible to his eyes.

762
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:52,760
How does the tenant look like?

763
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:54,200
He is a DJ.

764
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:57,040
He looks similar to Pappu
in our college.

765
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:01,000
Similar to Pappu?

766
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:02,280
It was a flash!

767
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:06,240
 He looks and smiles like Pappu
in college.

768
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:07,600
He speaks good.

769
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:09,160
Did Das meet him?

770
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:12,400
Only if he comes home
he could see him.

771
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:15,680
Okay, I want to meet him.

772
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:18,840
I'll not show him to you.

773
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:21,440
Okay, do one thing.

774
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:23,920
You and Das
come home this Sunday.

775
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:25,360
Okay.

776
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:32,400
Hello, sir.

777
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:33,600
This temple only.

778
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:36,520
The first woman regularly
visits this temple.

779
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:38,680
These women have a WhatsApp group.

780
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:39,920
'Inauspicious pooja time'

781
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,520
He is the only male in
that 'WhatsApp' group.

782
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:54,960
How are you and your family?

783
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,320
- All are good.
- Fine.

784
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:58,160
Please, come.

785
00:49:58,200 --> 00:49:59,600
We've to do an Archana.

786
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:01,040
To whose name?

787
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:02,280
 On the name of the god.

788
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:04,040
(Chanting mantras)

789
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:26,240
Give the garland to this young guy.

790
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:27,760
(Chanting mantras)

791
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:31,960
Then?

792
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,320
If you contest elections,
it seems, women will vote for you.

793
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:35,720
Nothing like that, sir.

794
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:39,000
Women come here
to worship the lord.

795
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:41,600
While they come, will you push
them from the terrace?

796
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:44,080
I don't know anything.

797
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:47,480
They'll convey their problems to me.

798
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:51,040
 Similarly, Malar said her husband
is not good.

799
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:53,240
 One day, by mistake, I told him.

800
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:54,720
He caught her trapped.

801
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:57,240
I asked him not to do that,
but he didn't heed.

802
00:50:57,480 --> 00:50:58,360
Who is that?

803
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:00,880
My wife is asking
when will I come home?

804
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,800
These higher officials
doesn't know this.

805
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:05,160
Brother, catch the guy
going by bicycle.

806
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:07,320
Stop there.

807
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:22,400
Hey, stop there.

808
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:25,040
Stop

809
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:40,320
It's hard to speak while running.

810
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:42,080
Don't be dubious on me.

811
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:43,640
I'll talk to you later.

812
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:51,720
Sir, I missed him.

813
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:57,000
Hey...get up.

814
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:00,400
Did you see anyone
running this way?

815
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:01,280
Get alcohol for me.

816
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:02,600
I'll reveal where he is.

817
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:03,920
Get alcohol for me.

818
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:05,000
I'll reveal where he is.

819
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:06,720
Do you know whom
your're speaking to?

820
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:07,640
Get alcohol for me.

821
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:08,320
I'll reveal where he is.

822
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:09,400
- Hey...
- Wait!

823
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:11,080
Get alcohol for me.

824
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:12,320
I'll reveal where he is.

825
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:15,960
Here it is...

826
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:25,920
Sir, please leave me.

827
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:28,200
It's hurting, sir.

828
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:30,120
 Sir, please...

829
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:32,680
Leave me...

830
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:34,200
I didn't know anything.

831
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:35,040
- Das.
- Sir.

832
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:37,280
She had an affair with
another person in the flats.

833
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:40,240
I don't know anything.

834
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:43,160
First, sit down and eat.

835
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:46,520
Sir, I didn't do anything.

836
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:47,680
It's hurting, sir.

837
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:49,640
It doesn't matter whether
you did or not.

838
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:51,480
You made me to run at this age.

839
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:53,160
Sir...

840
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:55,960
We've checked the CCTV footage
of the temple.

841
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,840
 He was in temple
when she fell.

842
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:00,880
- Will you say or not?
- Only, sometimes I....

843
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:01,600
It's okay.

844
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:03,960
Till the case gets over,
let him be here.

845
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,160
You're looking like a sick lizard
but do all criminal works.

846
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:08,360
I'll thump you.

847
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:10,200
You must understand
the feelings of girls.

848
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:11,400
They don't bother about
the physical appearance.

849
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:12,480
 But, they'll fall for
how we speak to them.

850
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:16,080
If people don't bother about family,
they'll fall for us.

851
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:17,360
I'll hit you.

852
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:20,600
In spite of all difficulties,
we've to take care of our family.

853
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:23,240
Can we keep nurturing
them every day?

854
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:25,200
You target them and speak routinely.

855
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:26,280
You dare to advise us.

856
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:27,400
 Shut your mouth.

857
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:30,360
To our mouth, when we need
many varieties of food

858
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:32,120
Don't we need that for our life?

859
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:33,800
I'll kill you.

860
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:35,840
Hi, bro...

861
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:37,080
Eyebrow?

862
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:38,240
It's not eyebrow.

863
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:39,640
It's hi! brother.

864
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:43,920
When a dog or the police chases you,
You shouldn't run.

865
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:45,720
Both aren't safe.

866
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:47,400
Yeah, you're right.

867
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:48,880
What about you?

868
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:51,520
You're related to the first girl
and I'm to the second.

869
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:53,600
I didn't do anything.

870
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:55,040
I too haven't done anything.

871
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:57,600
I didn't do anything.

872
00:54:57,640 --> 00:54:59,480
Is that, what you meant?

873
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,960
It's the first time for me.

874
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:04,560
But, she jumped over.

875
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:06,560
It's all my fate.

876
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:10,200
Oh, no! I don't have a count on it.

877
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:13,000
It's common in extra marital affairs.

878
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:14,880
Extra rice means?

879
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:17,240
It's not extra rice.

880
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:19,000
 It's extra marital affair.

881
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:26,080
When the husband doesn't care,
Others like us will intrude into the house.

882
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:29,480
You're a great person!

883
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:30,840
You must shut...

884
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:32,040
...the door.

885
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:35,560
Hi

886
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:36,480
Hi

887
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:38,640
Come in.

888
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:45,000
Can I get palm jaggery?

889
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:46,680
Palm jaggery?

890
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:47,480
Jaggery...

891
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:48,320
For what?

892
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:49,720
I asked for cooking.

893
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:51,320
Will you cook?

894
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:53,640
I like cooking than eating.

895
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:56,960
Why? will your cooking
won't taste good?

896
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,280
Why can't you taste it?

897
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:00,680
My hands are dirty.

898
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:03,440
You can take it
from second rack in kitchen.

899
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:30,640
Hello...

900
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:32,920
Hello...

901
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:34,320
I'm in the bedroom.

902
00:56:58,240 --> 00:56:59,920
Why are you doing this work?

903
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:02,960
You can get a maid.

904
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,720
They'll take the advance money
but won't turn up.

905
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:07,120
Get down, I'll do it.

906
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:08,120
No...

907
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:08,880
No problem.

908
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:09,960
- I'll do it.
- It's okay.

909
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:11,840
Give me.

910
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:29,920
What's this barcode,
which is seen in a product?

911
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:33,200
Nothing

912
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:35,320
It's just a tattoo.

913
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:48,960
"In the wings of crow,
Oh, lord..."

914
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:55,600
"All I see is your ebony complexion,
Oh, lord..."

915
00:57:56,600 --> 00:58:02,920
"In the wings of crow,
Oh, lord..."

916
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:09,000
"All I see is your ebony complexion,
Oh, lord..."

917
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:10,120
Nice song.

918
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:17,560
Would you like to have coffee?

919
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:20,800
I don't like coffee.

920
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:30,360
Who are they?

921
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:34,720
They are my spiritual gurus.

922
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:37,520
I'm in search of myself through them.

923
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:43,280
Got it?

924
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:45,960
Not yet.

925
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:55,320
Can you sing a poet Bharathi's song
for me?

926
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:05,840
"One evening alighted
on an elevated seat"

927
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:12,120
"I was watching the sky
and the ocean"

928
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:18,120
"One evening alighted
on an elevated seat"

929
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:25,000
"I was watching the sky
and the ocean"

930
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:33,280
Das, how long it's been
you took your wife out?

931
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:37,760
At this age, you'll be fond of
the police attire and moving around.

932
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:40,920
If you look back,
suddenly you'll become old.

933
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:43,880
 You'll be at the stage of
getting PF due in few months.

934
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,640
There won't be any memories.

935
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:51,520
No one was there to guide me
on your age.

936
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:54,280
 I'll come to the station.

937
00:59:54,360 --> 00:59:55,920
You take your wife go out.

938
00:59:58,600 --> 00:59:59,560
Are you at home?

939
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:02,040
No, I'm on the terrace
ready to jump.

940
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:04,160
 Sorry, Investigation was going on
throughout the night.

941
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:07,640
The food and attires were ready.

942
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:08,720
What else?

943
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:09,600
Nothing is needed.

944
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:10,280
I'm coming home.

945
01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:11,360
We'll go to a movie.

946
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:13,800
Sorry, it's a wrong number!

947
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:15,640
Hey, really.

948
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:16,520
Get ready.

949
01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:17,680
I'll come soon.

950
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:41,040
Aren't you ready yet?

951
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:42,640
Just five minutes.

952
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:43,440
Hurry up.

953
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:44,360
Let's go.

954
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:54,400
"Do you want to build a snowman?"

955
01:01:55,320 --> 01:01:58,040
"Come on, let's go and play."

956
01:01:58,360 --> 01:01:59,480
Vidhya

957
01:02:00,080 --> 01:02:01,680
I'm ready.

958
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:12,760
Vidhya, are you ready?

959
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:14,000
Come fast.

960
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:15,160
I'm coming.

961
01:03:01,840 --> 01:03:04,040
Sir...sir

962
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:07,240
What, brother?

963
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:09,760
Sir, what happened to your phone?

964
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:11,080
My phone!

965
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:12,520
The battery is down.

966
01:03:12,560 --> 01:03:13,760
Why? What happened?

967
01:03:16,120 --> 01:03:17,320
The third incident!

968
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:19,760
She has fallen from the terrace.

969
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:21,120
But, she's alive.

970
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:22,840
Okay, let's go.

971
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:34,960
I'll call you.

972
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:47,000
Sir.

973
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:47,720
Sorry, Das.

974
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:48,680
I've to call you back.

975
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:50,160
- It's okay, sir.
- Sit down.

976
01:03:52,280 --> 01:03:53,640
How is the condition, now?

977
01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:55,240
I'm waiting for the doctor.

978
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:57,320
He is yet to come out of
the operation theatre.

979
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:02,760
She is in her last moments.

980
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:03,840
If you need to ask anything,
you can.

981
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:04,920
Sure, doctor.

982
01:04:07,960 --> 01:04:09,000
Mam...

983
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:10,920
Mam...

984
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:16,000
Why did you jump from the building?

985
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:36,120
Doctor.

986
01:04:50,760 --> 01:04:51,760
Sorry.

987
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,000
Mom!

988
01:05:43,160 --> 01:05:54,560
"The woman's mind gets slurred
in the love of the man"

989
01:05:54,640 --> 01:06:05,840
"So my mind soughts me"

990
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:15,560
Hello!

991
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:17,240
I expected that you'll track
the case.

992
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:18,440
But, it's going on consecutively.

993
01:06:18,520 --> 01:06:20,640
One after another before
solving the previous case.

994
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:23,080
Not to wonder, even if two more
incidents happen.

995
01:06:23,120 --> 01:06:24,480
What are you saying?

996
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:25,560
Where is Kaalidas?

997
01:06:25,600 --> 01:06:26,640
He went out to take
the phone dump.

998
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:27,680
He'll be back.

999
01:06:27,720 --> 01:06:30,720
The phone and CCTV cameras have
backlogged the field work.

1000
01:06:30,760 --> 01:06:32,800
Everyone wants to complete
the work from where they're.

1001
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:34,000
It's the retirement time.

1002
01:06:34,040 --> 01:06:35,280
Fasten the case.

1003
01:06:36,360 --> 01:06:37,600
Das, what about the electricity board?

1004
01:06:37,640 --> 01:06:39,120
I've informed.
They'll come, sir.

1005
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:41,080
Has the blue whale reached the shore?

1006
01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:42,400
Yes, sir.

1007
01:06:42,440 --> 01:06:46,040
In last two cases, an illicit affair was
cited as a motive.

1008
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:48,720
But, she is an old woman,
staying alone.

1009
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:50,480
She came here six months ago.

1010
01:06:50,560 --> 01:06:54,280
So, there is no other coincidence
other than fall from height.

1011
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:01,160
Sir...

1012
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:02,400
It's a condom.

1013
01:07:07,160 --> 01:07:09,360
Sir, all roads lead to Rome.

1014
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:11,080
I'll call you later.

1015
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:13,720
Sir, the packet is fresh.

1016
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:14,960
I think, it's opened just now.

1017
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:15,840
What's the age?

1018
01:07:15,880 --> 01:07:16,960
Fifty five.

1019
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:21,280
Check in the dust bin
for any used one.

1020
01:07:21,320 --> 01:07:22,360
Okay, sir.

1021
01:07:22,680 --> 01:07:24,920
For someone's act,
someone else is suffering.

1022
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:28,360
Now, it's in the same track
of the last two cases, isn't it?

1023
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:29,680
Sir...

1024
01:07:29,720 --> 01:07:31,400
The call pattern seems to be normal.

1025
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:33,720
But, the recharge pattern is unusual.

1026
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:37,800
She has recharged once every two days
in two different shops for thirty rupees.

1027
01:07:37,880 --> 01:07:39,560
- Check it out.
- Yes, sir.

1028
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:40,960
Give that packet.

1029
01:07:41,040 --> 01:07:42,280
Sure, sir.

1030
01:07:42,680 --> 01:07:43,800
Brother! come, let's go.

1031
01:07:43,880 --> 01:07:44,840
I'm coming, sir.

1032
01:07:57,200 --> 01:07:58,320
Come in, sir.

1033
01:07:58,360 --> 01:07:59,560
Greetings, sir.

1034
01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:01,880
I've seen her
when she came to the shop.

1035
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:04,120
I don't know any other details, sir.

1036
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:06,040
Do you know when
she came last to the shop?

1037
01:08:06,080 --> 01:08:07,360
I'm not sure, sir.

1038
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:11,120
I'll recharge her phone,
that's all.

1039
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:13,080
Why did she recharge exactly
for thirty rupees?

1040
01:08:13,120 --> 01:08:16,960
Sir, either she doesn't have enough money
or that might be the scheme.

1041
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:21,960
Is this bought from your shop?

1042
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,160
Oh, holy crap!
I'm not selling all these.

1043
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:25,600
You mean, no!

1044
01:08:31,720 --> 01:08:33,720
You must come to the police station
whenever called, okay?

1045
01:08:33,760 --> 01:08:35,000
Yes, sir.

1046
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:36,640
How many children do you've?

1047
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:37,720
- Four.
- Four?

1048
01:08:37,760 --> 01:08:39,680
Buy at least for your own use.
Shall I leave?

1049
01:08:39,720 --> 01:08:40,680
Yes, sir.

1050
01:08:46,360 --> 01:08:47,640
Sir, this notebook.

1051
01:08:49,720 --> 01:08:51,840
Brother, when did she recharge?

1052
01:08:51,880 --> 01:08:53,520
On 22nd.

1053
01:08:56,440 --> 01:09:00,240
Brother, another number was
recharged with the same signature.

1054
01:09:00,280 --> 01:09:01,600
Call this number.

1055
01:09:06,280 --> 01:09:07,320
Yeah, call getting connected.

1056
01:09:07,360 --> 01:09:08,360
Speak now.

1057
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:09,760
Hello.

1058
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:10,960
Who's speaking?

1059
01:09:11,280 --> 01:09:12,640
It's you who called.

1060
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:14,280
It's you who answered the call.

1061
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:16,960
Sir, I'll keep talking,
you trace out the call.

1062
01:09:18,160 --> 01:09:19,400
Singham!

1063
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:21,720
Hey, how do you know my name?

1064
01:09:21,760 --> 01:09:23,480
Give the phone to Kaalidas.

1065
01:09:26,320 --> 01:09:27,960
I think, he's following us
with a camera.

1066
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,480
- Give me.
- He mention our names.

1067
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:31,640
Hello.

1068
01:09:31,680 --> 01:09:33,400
Das, this phone is in home.

1069
01:09:33,720 --> 01:09:34,800
Got any other clue?

1070
01:09:34,840 --> 01:09:35,600
No, sir.

1071
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:37,640
As of now, nothing else.

1072
01:09:37,680 --> 01:09:39,040
We're coming to the spot, sir.

1073
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:41,600
Brother, he is the AC

1074
01:09:42,160 --> 01:09:43,920
Oh, no! AC?

1075
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:52,760
Das, we've checked her phone.

1076
01:09:53,240 --> 01:09:55,320
All numbers are inactive,
except one.

1077
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:56,800
I got the address of that number.

1078
01:09:56,840 --> 01:09:57,880
We're going there now.

1079
01:09:57,960 --> 01:10:00,360
Track the live location of this number.

1080
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:01,400
Yes, sir.

1081
01:10:02,160 --> 01:10:04,440
Sir, tell me the location
of that number.

1082
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:11,720
Hello,

1083
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:12,920
Okay, sir.

1084
01:10:13,200 --> 01:10:15,000
We're going to Nungambakkam.

1085
01:10:17,080 --> 01:10:18,880
Where?

1086
01:10:18,920 --> 01:10:20,600
Sourashtra Nagar...

1087
01:10:20,680 --> 01:10:22,480
In Choolaimedu, isn't it?

1088
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:26,160
Sir, we'll take left.

1089
01:10:26,520 --> 01:10:27,720
Okay, sir.

1090
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:28,680
We're there only.

1091
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:29,680
It shows this way, right?

1092
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:30,800
Yes, sir.

1093
01:10:37,080 --> 01:10:38,800
Brother, stop that car.

1094
01:10:45,560 --> 01:10:47,000
Roll down the car window.

1095
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:49,000
Where are you coming from?

1096
01:10:49,080 --> 01:10:50,240
From Adyar, sir.

1097
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:56,960
Brother, a guy goes
there in hurry on bike.

1098
01:10:57,880 --> 01:10:59,000
Come, get on.

1099
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:51,480
The address of the number
which was active is here.

1100
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:52,880
That guy must be inside.

1101
01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:54,560
We too followed him, sir.

1102
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:55,880
He came in a bullet

1103
01:11:56,200 --> 01:11:57,520
But, we missed him.

1104
01:11:57,560 --> 01:11:58,480
We'll catch him.

1105
01:11:58,560 --> 01:11:59,560
No need to hurry.

1106
01:11:59,720 --> 01:12:01,560
He is the only clue that we have.

1107
01:12:02,040 --> 01:12:04,000
Don't know what's the situation there.

1108
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:07,200
Do you've 'Swiggy app' in your phone?

1109
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:07,880
Yes, sir.

1110
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:08,800
Open it.

1111
01:12:08,840 --> 01:12:10,960
Order something in that app
to this address.

1112
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:51,360
Sir, it's your pizza

1113
01:12:51,480 --> 01:12:52,920
I didn't order.

1114
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:55,280
Sir, Mr.Vivek?

1115
01:12:55,760 --> 01:12:56,680
Yeah.

1116
01:12:57,440 --> 01:12:59,360
The order has been placed in your name.

1117
01:12:59,400 --> 01:13:01,280
But, I didn't order anything.

1118
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:04,400
Sir, the amount is paid.

1119
01:13:04,440 --> 01:13:05,560
I told you,
I didn't order.

1120
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:06,640
Get lost.

1121
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:13,160
Have you delivered to that house?

1122
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:13,600
No, sir.

1123
01:13:13,640 --> 01:13:15,040
He said he didn't place the order.

1124
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:16,320
Who is there?

1125
01:13:16,360 --> 01:13:18,000
Only one person was there.

1126
01:13:18,080 --> 01:13:19,120
How is he looking like?

1127
01:13:19,160 --> 01:13:20,720
He is looking smart, sir.

1128
01:13:20,760 --> 01:13:22,000
But, inebriated.

1129
01:13:25,160 --> 01:13:26,920
Okay, do what I say.

1130
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:02,920
- Sir...
- Hey, what do you want?

1131
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:03,720
Go away.

1132
01:14:03,800 --> 01:14:04,560
Sir...

1133
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:07,000
Sir, just a minute.

1134
01:14:07,080 --> 01:14:08,280
Okay, give me.

1135
01:14:16,120 --> 01:14:17,600
Sir...

1136
01:14:17,720 --> 01:14:18,640
Turn him.

1137
01:14:18,720 --> 01:14:19,960
Leave me.

1138
01:14:20,040 --> 01:14:21,720
Sir...

1139
01:14:23,080 --> 01:14:24,400
Shut your mouth.

1140
01:14:25,280 --> 01:14:26,600
Sir...

1141
01:14:28,360 --> 01:14:29,280
Sir

1142
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:31,360
He is...

1143
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:32,360
Sir

1144
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:42,160
She won't come for all that.

1145
01:14:42,200 --> 01:14:43,400
She'll rent out only the place.

1146
01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:44,840
We've to take the person.

1147
01:14:44,920 --> 01:14:46,600
When this message spread out
and became a problem...

1148
01:14:46,680 --> 01:14:48,280
 ...she vacated the house.

1149
01:14:48,760 --> 01:14:50,280
Sir, I don't know
where the new house is located.

1150
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:52,760
She called me after four months.

1151
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:54,400
But, she denied.

1152
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:57,280
Sir, murder is a big thing.

1153
01:14:57,320 --> 01:14:59,920
Sir, I was here on that day at 2 o'clock.

1154
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,640
Even my friend posted a like in Facebook.

1155
01:15:01,720 --> 01:15:03,040
Please, check it.

1156
01:15:03,080 --> 01:15:04,000
Sir...

1157
01:15:04,040 --> 01:15:06,360
Please, sir.

1158
01:15:09,160 --> 01:15:10,920
Do you know these people?

1159
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:13,200
Don't know, sir.

1160
01:15:13,240 --> 01:15:14,320
It's a big network, sir.

1161
01:15:14,360 --> 01:15:16,720
Shilpa owned a bouquet shop
at the entrance of the pub.

1162
01:15:16,760 --> 01:15:18,920
I know this woman
through Shilpa.

1163
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:21,400
If you inquire her,
you'll get the details.

1164
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:22,560
Where is Shilpa?

1165
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:39,400
Hello.

1166
01:15:39,440 --> 01:15:41,640
Is there anyone as Shilpa here?

1167
01:15:41,680 --> 01:15:43,360
No one is here by that name.

1168
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:45,680
Hey,

1169
01:15:45,720 --> 01:15:46,680
Sir...

1170
01:15:47,680 --> 01:15:49,120
I don't know anyone like that.

1171
01:15:49,160 --> 01:15:50,920
Better, you inquire inside.

1172
01:15:52,160 --> 01:15:53,280
Okay, let's go.

1173
01:16:03,440 --> 01:16:04,520
Sir...

1174
01:16:05,080 --> 01:16:06,280
Why are you here?

1175
01:16:06,320 --> 01:16:07,640
I've come for a small inquiry.

1176
01:16:07,680 --> 01:16:08,480
Are you good?

1177
01:16:08,520 --> 01:16:09,360
I'm good, sir.

1178
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:10,920
Come in, sir.

1179
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:14,640
Sir, let's have a coffee.
Come on.

1180
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:22,640
Watch your step, sir.

1181
01:16:30,680 --> 01:16:34,320
Inspector Das sir.

1182
01:16:34,360 --> 01:16:35,600
I told you about him, isn't it?

1183
01:16:35,640 --> 01:16:36,760
Get coffee.

1184
01:16:37,560 --> 01:16:38,840
Is it Anita?

1185
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:39,800
Yeah, sir.

1186
01:16:39,880 --> 01:16:41,320
I don't want coffee.

1187
01:16:41,720 --> 01:16:42,840
You go to school.

1188
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:44,560
No time for that.

1189
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:46,800
Is there anyone as Shilpa here?

1190
01:16:46,840 --> 01:16:49,320
Few women have
the same name here.

1191
01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:51,440
But, don't know who is
the one you mention about?

1192
01:16:51,480 --> 01:16:52,400
Where were they?

1193
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:54,040
Sir, children are there.

1194
01:16:54,080 --> 01:16:55,600
Shall we inquire
by calling them out?

1195
01:16:55,640 --> 01:16:57,400
No time to inquire separately.

1196
01:16:57,440 --> 01:16:58,480
It's very urgent.

1197
01:16:58,920 --> 01:17:00,040
Sir, come on...

1198
01:18:00,440 --> 01:18:01,880
Sir, that woman!

1199
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:11,320
Hey, come fast.

1200
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:12,400
Get on...

1201
01:18:17,560 --> 01:18:18,600
Hurry up.

1202
01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:20,680
Go...
Chase them.

1203
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:31,760
Follow them.

1204
01:18:56,520 --> 01:18:57,760
Hey, go...

1205
01:18:57,840 --> 01:19:00,120
Hurry up.
Take the vehicle.

1206
01:19:13,720 --> 01:19:15,480
Take right and go straight.

1207
01:19:20,760 --> 01:19:21,560
Stop...

1208
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:22,560
Brother, go that way.

1209
01:19:22,600 --> 01:19:23,240
Hey...

1210
01:19:23,280 --> 01:19:24,040
Sir...

1211
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:26,440
Hey, where is that woman?

1212
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:27,440
I'm not a pimp.

1213
01:19:27,480 --> 01:19:28,720
Just a commuter.

1214
01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:29,640
Sir...

1215
01:19:29,680 --> 01:19:30,440
Where is Shilpa?

1216
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:31,280
Sir, which Shilpa?

1217
01:19:31,320 --> 01:19:32,040
Tell me.

1218
01:19:32,080 --> 01:19:35,000
Sir, I promise,
I don't know.

1219
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:35,840
Tell me.

1220
01:19:35,880 --> 01:19:36,920
Sir, I promise,
I don't know.

1221
01:19:36,960 --> 01:19:37,760
Tell the truth.

1222
01:19:37,800 --> 01:19:39,680
I'll tell you, sir.

1223
01:19:39,720 --> 01:19:40,880
Sir, those were temporary names.

1224
01:19:40,920 --> 01:19:42,760
Das! Take him to the vehicle.

1225
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:44,000
Sir....sir

1226
01:19:49,680 --> 01:19:51,280
Sir...

1227
01:19:51,440 --> 01:19:52,880
Have you got caught?

1228
01:19:52,920 --> 01:19:54,600
On that day,
you said you've influence.

1229
01:19:54,640 --> 01:19:55,960
Was everything lies?

1230
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,440
- Hey,
- Sir.

1231
01:19:57,520 --> 01:19:58,520
Do you know him?

1232
01:19:58,560 --> 01:19:59,680
His girl?

1233
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:00,880
She is Shanthi.

1234
01:20:00,920 --> 01:20:01,960
Now got admitted in a hospital.

1235
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:02,800
Which hospital?

1236
01:20:02,840 --> 01:20:04,120
Rao hospital, sir.

1237
01:20:15,320 --> 01:20:17,240
Is anyone admitted here
in the name, 'Shanthi'?

1238
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:18,400
Just a minute, sir.

1239
01:20:19,400 --> 01:20:20,440
Hello.

1240
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:23,240
- Sir, Room no.14, first floor.
- No.14

1241
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:24,360
Sir,

1242
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:25,840
Das, go and check.

1243
01:20:25,880 --> 01:20:27,200
- I'll wait here.
- Yes, sir.

1244
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:28,960
Hey, come with me.

1245
01:20:29,560 --> 01:20:31,160
Hey, stay here.

1246
01:20:58,160 --> 01:21:00,640
Sir, will you let me free
if you get her?

1247
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:04,080
From yesterday, we are chasing
like James bond.

1248
01:21:04,120 --> 01:21:06,160
Come to the station,
I'll leave you.

1249
01:21:41,680 --> 01:21:42,640
Where is she?

1250
01:21:42,680 --> 01:21:45,440
Sir, she would've got
the information and left.

1251
01:21:45,480 --> 01:21:46,680
No use of searching her.

1252
01:21:54,080 --> 01:21:56,760
- Tell me.
- Sir, she is missing.

1253
01:21:56,800 --> 01:21:57,840
I expected!

1254
01:22:10,200 --> 01:22:11,040
Sir...

1255
01:22:11,080 --> 01:22:12,640
I'll go home and be back.

1256
01:22:12,720 --> 01:22:13,440
You leave later.

1257
01:22:13,480 --> 01:22:14,760
- Okay?
- Yes, sir.

1258
01:22:23,400 --> 01:22:24,640
Come on.
Sit there.

1259
01:22:25,360 --> 01:22:26,320
Sir...

1260
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:31,560
Hey, better stretch out and sleep.

1261
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:32,280
Get up.

1262
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:33,120
I'll hit you.

1263
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:35,200
Look at his moss and mocker.

1264
01:22:35,960 --> 01:22:36,840
Take this.

1265
01:22:37,320 --> 01:22:38,680
Four of you share and eat.

1266
01:22:39,040 --> 01:22:40,480
Sir, this little quantity for everyone?

1267
01:22:40,520 --> 01:22:43,040
You're an accused,
you must be given poison.

1268
01:22:43,080 --> 01:22:45,240
Instead, I'm giving you food.
Better go and eat.

1269
01:22:45,280 --> 01:22:47,760
Welcome.
Accused no. 3 and 4.

1270
01:22:48,200 --> 01:22:49,960
I'm just for commuting.

1271
01:22:50,640 --> 01:22:54,440
Don't feel bad.
Eat now.

1272
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:56,440
It's safe for us
to be in the prison.

1273
01:22:56,480 --> 01:23:00,800
Someone is killing the women,
letting off men.

1274
01:23:00,840 --> 01:23:02,280
Male chauvinist.

1275
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:04,080
What do you mean by that?

1276
01:23:04,160 --> 01:23:06,360
Still believing,
it's a male dominant world.

1277
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:08,800
Okay.
Come, let's eat.

1278
01:23:22,520 --> 01:23:34,040
"The woman's mind gets slurred
in the love of the man"

1279
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:44,920
"So my mind soughts me"

1280
01:23:48,200 --> 01:23:53,800
"It celebrates ever..."

1281
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:58,360
"It straits for still more"

1282
01:23:58,400 --> 01:24:04,040
"The stars...
In my eyes..."

1283
01:24:04,080 --> 01:24:10,040
"The untold smell on me"

1284
01:24:11,320 --> 01:24:17,080
"I'm living with the eyes,
which are without deception"

1285
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:28,200
"I feel myself...
I'm forgetting the world"

1286
01:24:28,280 --> 01:24:39,640
"I feel myself...
I'm forgetting the world"

1287
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:11,280
"The happiness is searching
for me like a butterfly"

1288
01:25:11,360 --> 01:25:17,440
"It'll learn millions of poetries
and recite into my ears"

1289
01:25:17,480 --> 01:25:23,240
"When the answers came to me
the queries was stopped"

1290
01:25:23,280 --> 01:25:28,880
"I won my dreams
when the barriers were broken up"

1291
01:25:28,920 --> 01:25:31,720
"I get fulfilled within me"

1292
01:25:31,760 --> 01:25:34,600
"I melt in your memories"

1293
01:25:34,680 --> 01:25:37,240
"I get fulfilled within me"

1294
01:25:37,280 --> 01:25:40,600
"I melt in your memories"

1295
01:25:40,680 --> 01:25:46,360
"I'm painting my life with colours"

1296
01:25:46,400 --> 01:25:57,200
"I'm born again..."

1297
01:25:59,080 --> 01:26:02,040
Sir, this is the address and phone number
of the guy in petty shop.

1298
01:26:02,120 --> 01:26:04,400
He said he'll come for inquiry
whenever called.

1299
01:26:04,600 --> 01:26:05,400
Yes, sir.

1300
01:26:05,440 --> 01:26:06,200
Witness no.2

1301
01:26:06,240 --> 01:26:07,080
Sir...

1302
01:26:07,720 --> 01:26:09,280
Staying nearby.

1303
01:26:09,320 --> 01:26:11,080
Their address and phone number.

1304
01:26:46,760 --> 01:26:47,680
- Brother,
- Sir...

1305
01:26:47,760 --> 01:26:50,520
It's the common place which connects
the three deceased women.

1306
01:26:51,160 --> 01:26:54,840
Where does the women go regularly,
who resides in this zone?

1307
01:26:54,880 --> 01:26:56,520
They'll go to the temple
in the morning...

1308
01:26:56,560 --> 01:26:57,960
...and to the shops.

1309
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,720
And go to schools
to bring their children.

1310
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:02,000
Excuse me, Sir.

1311
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:05,880
As daily chores, they'll go to the gym,
school, market and the grocery shop.

1312
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:09,560
To the temple, laundry, butchery shop,
fancy shops and malls.

1313
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:11,200
If luxurious enough,
they'll go to pub.

1314
01:27:11,240 --> 01:27:12,680
As monthly routine,
they'll go the beauty parlour...

1315
01:27:12,720 --> 01:27:17,800
...fair price shops, medical shop,
chit funds and bajans in some monasteries.

1316
01:27:17,840 --> 01:27:22,080
Apart from that, frequent visits
to jewellery shops, relative's functions...

1317
01:27:22,120 --> 01:27:23,600
...and to the hospitals.

1318
01:27:23,640 --> 01:27:25,880
That's all the places
where women's life is.

1319
01:27:28,080 --> 01:27:30,880
- Super.
- Thank you.

1320
01:27:31,880 --> 01:27:33,720
A male chauvinist!

1321
01:27:33,920 --> 01:27:34,800
Who is he?

1322
01:27:34,840 --> 01:27:37,080
Sir, AC is calling you.

1323
01:27:37,120 --> 01:27:38,360
I'm coming.

1324
01:27:38,960 --> 01:27:39,840
- Brother,
- Sir.

1325
01:27:39,880 --> 01:27:42,520
Check whether these three women
connect to the places he mentioned.

1326
01:27:42,560 --> 01:27:43,360
Okay, sir.

1327
01:27:43,400 --> 01:27:46,840
(Indistinct voices)

1328
01:27:46,920 --> 01:27:48,400
Sir, did you call me?

1329
01:27:52,960 --> 01:27:55,440
Three women died
because of illicit affair.

1330
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:57,680
Is it suicide or murder?

1331
01:27:58,000 --> 01:27:59,160
Read the last paragraph.

1332
01:28:00,680 --> 01:28:05,640
The Police officer Kaalidas
has revealed about the investigation...

1333
01:28:06,120 --> 01:28:07,080
What's this?

1334
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:09,080
Sir, I'm not aware.

1335
01:28:09,120 --> 01:28:11,640
The reporter has used my name
since he is known to me.

1336
01:28:12,480 --> 01:28:16,760
Das, I didn't take up this job yesterday.

1337
01:28:17,240 --> 01:28:18,920
Don't you've any other incident
to publicise yourself?

1338
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:22,000
Sir, I don't need this cheap publicity.

1339
01:28:22,040 --> 01:28:25,240
Moreover, this wasn't a fake news.

1340
01:28:25,520 --> 01:28:26,680
Those women were wrong.

1341
01:28:26,720 --> 01:28:28,920
Right and wrong depends
on their mind.

1342
01:28:30,400 --> 01:28:33,000
Did you think of their families?

1343
01:28:34,160 --> 01:28:37,120
Along with their agony,
they've to bear this shame too.

1344
01:28:37,840 --> 01:28:40,520
If worried about shame,
they should've brought them up good.

1345
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:43,400
When did the police started
moral policing?

1346
01:28:45,440 --> 01:28:48,080
Do you know how the family grieves
if a girl was dead?

1347
01:28:48,320 --> 01:28:50,520
You would've known,
if you've felt that agony.

1348
01:28:50,600 --> 01:28:51,680
I know, sir.

1349
01:28:52,080 --> 01:28:53,720
But, I didn't give this news, sir.

1350
01:28:55,440 --> 01:28:57,280
When the wrong people are exposed,

1351
01:28:57,320 --> 01:28:58,680
I can't do anything.

1352
01:29:00,360 --> 01:29:02,840
I'll go home and be back, sir.

1353
01:29:14,640 --> 01:29:16,480
- Tell me.
- Sir, a breaking information.

1354
01:29:16,520 --> 01:29:18,800
In the call history of
the deceased women no.1 and 3,

1355
01:29:18,880 --> 01:29:20,000
A single number is common.

1356
01:29:20,040 --> 01:29:20,720
Whose number is that?

1357
01:29:20,800 --> 01:29:21,600
His name is David.

1358
01:29:21,640 --> 01:29:22,400
Thiruverkadu.

1359
01:29:22,440 --> 01:29:23,240
I've checked the proof.

1360
01:29:23,280 --> 01:29:24,160
Everything is original.

1361
01:29:24,200 --> 01:29:25,000
Is it?

1362
01:29:25,040 --> 01:29:26,240
I'll call you later.

1363
01:29:31,080 --> 01:29:33,640
Brother,
I'll send you an address.

1364
01:29:33,880 --> 01:29:36,000
Check the person immediately.

1365
01:29:59,640 --> 01:30:01,880
- Where did you go?
- I must ask this.

1366
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:04,520
Regarding the cases of those women...

1367
01:30:04,560 --> 01:30:05,560
You've phone, isn't it?

1368
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:06,520
You might've informed me.

1369
01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:08,160
You know,
I'll be busy in investigation.

1370
01:30:08,200 --> 01:30:09,560
You would've called me.

1371
01:30:10,440 --> 01:30:11,480
When I call you,

1372
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:13,760
You may be hiding
to catch someone.

1373
01:30:13,800 --> 01:30:16,120
When hearing the ring tone,
if he does anything to you!

1374
01:30:16,160 --> 01:30:17,520
Is all those necessary for me?

1375
01:30:18,120 --> 01:30:19,880
First, stop watching the soap operas.

1376
01:30:20,200 --> 01:30:21,320
Give the key.

1377
01:30:27,360 --> 01:30:28,840
Give me, I'll open.

1378
01:31:04,680 --> 01:31:07,000
A new tenant has come to
the first floor.

1379
01:31:07,040 --> 01:31:08,640
I've the advance amount.

1380
01:31:15,520 --> 01:31:16,360
What happened?

1381
01:31:16,400 --> 01:31:18,560
Why are you coming here?
Is this a choultry?

1382
01:31:20,600 --> 01:31:22,480
You stay here for just ten minutes.

1383
01:31:22,520 --> 01:31:24,600
You can't even listen
to what I say.

1384
01:31:25,120 --> 01:31:28,200
No...the case is
getting complicated.

1385
01:31:28,640 --> 01:31:29,440
That's why...

1386
01:31:29,480 --> 01:31:30,320
Go...

1387
01:31:30,360 --> 01:31:31,640
Better spend time for the cases.

1388
01:31:31,680 --> 01:31:33,800
You don't bother about our life
getting complicated.

1389
01:31:33,840 --> 01:31:36,440
No, I'm trying to spend time
with you.

1390
01:31:36,480 --> 01:31:38,280
But, the situation is like that.

1391
01:31:39,800 --> 01:31:41,400
Gather time, patiently.

1392
01:31:41,440 --> 01:31:42,880
I won't be here, then.

1393
01:32:02,240 --> 01:32:03,480
Just a minute, brother.

1394
01:32:07,240 --> 01:32:08,440
Tell me, now.

1395
01:32:08,480 --> 01:32:10,040
I'm in Thiruverkadu.

1396
01:32:10,080 --> 01:32:11,800
The proof is right.

1397
01:32:12,280 --> 01:32:14,320
His name is David Susai.

1398
01:32:14,360 --> 01:32:16,000
But, he is not here.

1399
01:32:16,040 --> 01:32:17,960
No one is aware of his whereabouts.

1400
01:32:18,040 --> 01:32:19,200
Is there any image of him?

1401
01:32:19,240 --> 01:32:21,000
No, sir.

1402
01:32:21,040 --> 01:32:24,240
Check whether the address
is updated when the phone number is...

1403
01:32:24,280 --> 01:32:27,440
...attached to any government documents.

1404
01:32:27,480 --> 01:32:29,000
- I'm coming.
- Okay, sir.

1405
01:32:41,840 --> 01:32:42,840
Hello.

1406
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:45,600
Somehow save me with the
department's help.

1407
01:32:45,640 --> 01:32:47,560
Henceforth, I won't go for this job.

1408
01:32:49,160 --> 01:32:50,960
Near Manapakkam bridge.

1409
01:33:04,840 --> 01:33:05,880
What happened?

1410
01:33:09,120 --> 01:33:10,160
Nothing.

1411
01:33:10,200 --> 01:33:12,120
You doesn't look so.

1412
01:33:16,680 --> 01:33:18,160
Shall I tell you one thing?

1413
01:33:19,840 --> 01:33:21,880
In the stationary shop,
though numerous pens are there...

1414
01:33:21,920 --> 01:33:24,160
...the shop keeper knows
only to scribble with the pen.

1415
01:33:24,200 --> 01:33:25,600
He doesn't know it's value.

1416
01:33:28,320 --> 01:33:29,440
Not good?

1417
01:33:33,320 --> 01:33:34,400
Shall I?

1418
01:33:38,520 --> 01:33:41,560
Actually, cutting is an art.
You know?

1419
01:34:25,440 --> 01:34:26,960
It's okay for engagement.

1420
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:28,320
You go...

1421
01:34:29,880 --> 01:34:31,800
No one will mistake.

1422
01:34:31,840 --> 01:34:33,000
Okay?

1423
01:34:40,120 --> 01:34:41,280
Chain snatching, sir.

1424
01:34:41,760 --> 01:34:43,000
I'll call you back, dear.

1425
01:34:44,600 --> 01:34:45,600
Where did you catch him?

1426
01:34:45,640 --> 01:34:46,680
In Thirupathi Nagar.

1427
01:34:54,080 --> 01:34:57,640
Did you see anyone suspicious,
roaming around there?

1428
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,240
Have you seen these
three women anywhere?

1429
01:35:07,640 --> 01:35:09,440
I'll leave you,
if you say the truth.

1430
01:35:12,560 --> 01:35:14,120
I know that woman, sir.

1431
01:35:35,560 --> 01:35:37,080
Multiple cuts, sir.

1432
01:35:37,360 --> 01:35:38,520
See this blood.

1433
01:35:39,360 --> 01:35:42,480
Instead of spilling from
the woman's body, it was scattered.

1434
01:35:44,040 --> 01:35:48,040
The blood of the deceased
won't be in round shape.

1435
01:35:48,840 --> 01:35:50,560
In the struggle between the two,

1436
01:35:50,600 --> 01:35:53,000
The blood might've scattered
from the murderer.

1437
01:35:53,040 --> 01:35:55,840
If there is a suspect list,
we can confirm by the test.

1438
01:35:56,880 --> 01:36:00,280
Sir, it's her phone.

1439
01:36:10,920 --> 01:36:12,320
- Ganesh,
- Yes, sir.

1440
01:36:12,360 --> 01:36:14,400
Check whose number is this.

1441
01:36:14,800 --> 01:36:17,520
98402 74281

1442
01:36:21,640 --> 01:36:23,680
Sir, it's in the name of the
Inspector Kalidas.

1443
01:36:23,720 --> 01:36:25,760
What?
Are you sure?

1444
01:36:25,840 --> 01:36:27,200
Confirm, sir.

1445
01:36:49,360 --> 01:36:53,040
Ganesh, I want the last week
call records of the Inspector Kalidas.

1446
01:37:04,880 --> 01:37:07,240
- Tell me sir.
- Das, where are you?

1447
01:37:07,280 --> 01:37:09,440
I'm at inquiry.
Should I come?

1448
01:37:09,680 --> 01:37:11,120
No, I'll take care.

1449
01:37:11,160 --> 01:37:12,240
Okay sir.

1450
01:37:38,640 --> 01:37:49,160
"Is the man's face a bliss?"

1451
01:37:50,400 --> 01:37:53,680
"Like the flower fondled
by the fingers"

1452
01:37:53,720 --> 01:37:55,840
"Like the island caressed
by the clouds"

1453
01:37:55,880 --> 01:38:00,320
"Has the bliss spread
in my whole heart"

1454
01:38:00,360 --> 01:38:05,680
"The sorrows are at distance"

1455
01:38:05,720 --> 01:38:11,080
"It's the sweetest time"

1456
01:38:11,160 --> 01:38:16,960
"Beyond the borders"

1457
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:21,840
"The nostalgia garners"

1458
01:38:21,920 --> 01:38:28,800
"Enticing..."

1459
01:38:55,280 --> 01:38:58,160
By the way, do you've
her blood reports?

1460
01:38:58,200 --> 01:38:59,080
Positive, sir.

1461
01:38:59,120 --> 01:39:01,920
As you guessed,
that wasn't the blood of the deceased.

1462
01:39:02,280 --> 01:39:04,880
See whether you know
these three women?

1463
01:39:08,280 --> 01:39:09,560
Tell me.

1464
01:39:09,600 --> 01:39:13,840
Sir, this phone number is linked
to the parlour in Thirupathi Nagar.

1465
01:39:14,280 --> 01:39:16,720
I've shared you the parlour address.

1466
01:39:25,920 --> 01:39:26,920
Sir.

1467
01:39:27,320 --> 01:39:29,160
Who is David Susai here?

1468
01:39:29,200 --> 01:39:30,920
Just a minute, sir.
I'll call him.

1469
01:39:35,840 --> 01:39:36,960
Hello, sir.

1470
01:39:45,760 --> 01:39:48,040
Those three women aren't alive now.

1471
01:39:48,120 --> 01:39:50,080
You're the only person
associated to them.

1472
01:39:50,960 --> 01:39:51,880
What did you do?

1473
01:39:51,920 --> 01:39:53,800
Many people come here.

1474
01:39:53,840 --> 01:39:56,680
How could you ask
who is alive or dead?

1475
01:39:57,400 --> 01:40:00,200
So, you don't know
these three women?

1476
01:40:01,360 --> 01:40:02,440
Just a minute, sir.

1477
01:40:02,840 --> 01:40:04,480
- Stella, come here.
- Sir.

1478
01:40:06,080 --> 01:40:08,240
Have you seen these women
in our parlour?

1479
01:40:08,320 --> 01:40:09,640
I don't remember these two women.

1480
01:40:09,680 --> 01:40:11,400
But, I've seen the third woman.

1481
01:40:11,640 --> 01:40:14,400
Do you know when they visited
the parlour?

1482
01:40:14,440 --> 01:40:16,320
We'll know the date
if there is a phone number.

1483
01:40:16,360 --> 01:40:18,520
We can check the CCTV footage, sir.

1484
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:19,600
Shall we check?

1485
01:40:25,160 --> 01:40:26,800
Sir, that second one.

1486
01:40:30,320 --> 01:40:31,840
Sir, that first girl.

1487
01:40:36,840 --> 01:40:39,160
Have they ever came together?

1488
01:40:39,200 --> 01:40:40,320
I'll check.

1489
01:40:40,360 --> 01:40:44,000
Sir, I brought AC George sir
from here, on the first day.

1490
01:40:46,480 --> 01:40:48,400
Has Assistant Commissioner George
came here?

1491
01:40:48,440 --> 01:40:50,400
Sir, he came here once.

1492
01:40:50,440 --> 01:40:51,960
His son visits often.

1493
01:40:52,640 --> 01:40:53,720
Does he have a son?

1494
01:40:53,760 --> 01:40:54,800
Don't know.

1495
01:40:56,240 --> 01:40:57,400
Think well.

1496
01:40:57,920 --> 01:40:58,600
Yes, sir.

1497
01:40:58,640 --> 01:40:59,800
He belongs to this hamlet.

1498
01:40:59,840 --> 01:41:01,120
How he will be?

1499
01:41:01,560 --> 01:41:05,800
Fair, tall, wearing spectacles.

1500
01:41:15,960 --> 01:41:17,120
Do you have his footage?

1501
01:41:17,160 --> 01:41:19,320
- Sir, let me check.
- Check it.

1502
01:41:22,320 --> 01:41:23,880
Sir, look here.

1503
01:41:32,080 --> 01:41:33,960
Is the opposite angle of
CCTV footage available?

1504
01:41:34,040 --> 01:41:35,120
We have

1505
01:42:44,480 --> 01:42:47,720
'You are trying to call...'

1506
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,320
'You are trying to call...'

1507
01:46:04,400 --> 01:46:06,960
Leave me...

1508
01:46:18,680 --> 01:46:20,240
What happened?

1509
01:46:24,560 --> 01:46:25,840
Who is upstairs?

1510
01:46:27,880 --> 01:46:28,920
The tenant!

1511
01:46:29,640 --> 01:46:30,960
Does Das know?

1512
01:46:34,200 --> 01:46:35,120
No...

1513
01:46:37,760 --> 01:46:39,200
Who did all these?

1514
01:46:40,400 --> 01:46:41,400
It's him.

1515
01:46:41,440 --> 01:46:42,920
Why? What's the problem?

1516
01:46:47,240 --> 01:46:48,960
Do you know these women?

1517
01:46:52,560 --> 01:46:53,840
Who are they?

1518
01:46:54,560 --> 01:46:56,360
They were my parlour friends.

1519
01:46:58,800 --> 01:47:00,080
Is he upstairs?

1520
01:47:01,480 --> 01:47:02,720
Come, let's go.

1521
01:47:03,680 --> 01:47:05,400
Come, we'll see.

1522
01:47:05,440 --> 01:47:06,440
Come.

1523
01:47:07,240 --> 01:47:09,400
Be bold.
I'm here.

1524
01:47:09,440 --> 01:47:10,360
Come.

1525
01:47:11,280 --> 01:47:13,000
Five women were in your group.

1526
01:47:13,040 --> 01:47:15,160
Four of them aren't alive now.

1527
01:47:15,200 --> 01:47:16,680
Do you know why?

1528
01:47:16,880 --> 01:47:18,120
Bad company.

1529
01:47:19,160 --> 01:47:20,880
Anything between you and that guy?

1530
01:47:20,920 --> 01:47:21,960
No

1531
01:47:22,640 --> 01:47:24,600
Else, he won't behave like that.

1532
01:47:26,040 --> 01:47:27,880
If anything is there,
it's okay.

1533
01:47:28,160 --> 01:47:30,040
Das is not at all taking care of you.

1534
01:47:31,360 --> 01:47:33,160
He doesn't have time for you.

1535
01:47:33,200 --> 01:47:35,160
It's hard to be with him.

1536
01:47:35,200 --> 01:47:36,720
But, I can't live without him.

1537
01:47:36,760 --> 01:47:37,840
Come.

1538
01:47:47,160 --> 01:47:48,360
Das, you stay there.

1539
01:47:48,920 --> 01:47:50,120
Vidhya

1540
01:47:51,240 --> 01:47:52,720
Das, don't come upstairs.

1541
01:47:52,760 --> 01:47:54,440
Sir, my wife!

1542
01:47:54,480 --> 01:47:55,520
Wife!

1543
01:47:55,600 --> 01:47:57,400
Not known to you all these days?

1544
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:05,080
You said that he is upstairs.

1545
01:48:06,160 --> 01:48:07,200
Show me.

1546
01:48:07,760 --> 01:48:08,720
Go

1547
01:48:25,080 --> 01:48:26,200
Vidhya!

1548
01:48:28,960 --> 01:48:31,120
Das, wait.

1549
01:49:06,480 --> 01:49:07,520
Vidhya!

1550
01:49:08,440 --> 01:49:09,600
Vidhya!

1551
01:49:10,120 --> 01:49:11,000
Hey...

1552
01:49:11,720 --> 01:49:12,880
Nothing, dear

1553
01:49:12,920 --> 01:49:14,120
I've come.

1554
01:49:14,520 --> 01:49:16,120
Vidhya, calm down.

1555
01:49:16,960 --> 01:49:18,360
Calm down, Vidhya.

1556
01:49:22,720 --> 01:49:24,600
Hey...

1557
01:49:24,640 --> 01:49:25,400
Madam.

1558
01:49:25,440 --> 01:49:26,360
Vidhya!

1559
01:49:26,440 --> 01:49:28,360
Are you planning to separate us?

1560
01:49:28,400 --> 01:49:31,120
I'll kill you.

1561
01:49:31,440 --> 01:49:32,880
Listen me, leave him.

1562
01:49:32,920 --> 01:49:34,240
What are you doing?

1563
01:49:34,280 --> 01:49:35,400
I'll Kill you

1564
01:49:35,440 --> 01:49:36,960
Vidhya, relax.

1565
01:49:37,160 --> 01:49:38,280
Kill you

1566
01:49:38,320 --> 01:49:39,360
Relax

1567
01:49:41,640 --> 01:49:43,000
Relax...

1568
01:49:48,920 --> 01:49:50,840
Something is happening here, sir.

1569
01:50:05,320 --> 01:50:07,720
It seems, Vidhya speaks a lot
only with you.

1570
01:50:07,760 --> 01:50:08,800
Obviously, sir.

1571
01:50:08,840 --> 01:50:09,840
I'm her friend.

1572
01:50:09,920 --> 01:50:11,600
I'm also her Psychologist.

1573
01:50:11,640 --> 01:50:14,320
What's her problem to
consult a Psychologist?

1574
01:50:15,680 --> 01:50:17,800
She is Schizophrenic.

1575
01:50:17,840 --> 01:50:20,600
In her case, she
doesn't know the...

1576
01:50:20,680 --> 01:50:22,880
difference between the
real and delusion.

1577
01:50:22,920 --> 01:50:24,920
She gives a form to the image
in her mind and lives with that.

1578
01:50:24,960 --> 01:50:26,440
So, she is imagining things.

1579
01:50:26,520 --> 01:50:27,680
Why so?

1580
01:50:27,920 --> 01:50:29,560
There are numerous reasons.

1581
01:50:29,600 --> 01:50:32,720
Her child died within
two days of birth.

1582
01:50:33,120 --> 01:50:35,400
She was very depressed after that.

1583
01:50:42,400 --> 01:50:46,080
She began to live with the child
which is not alive.

1584
01:50:48,560 --> 01:50:51,520
Without her conscious,
she started blabbering...

1585
01:50:51,560 --> 01:50:53,920
...like her child went to school,
playing outside and all.

1586
01:50:54,240 --> 01:50:55,280
Bye

1587
01:50:55,640 --> 01:50:56,600
Does Das know about it?

1588
01:50:56,680 --> 01:50:59,760
"Do you want to build a snowman?"

1589
01:51:00,200 --> 01:51:02,280
Come on, let's go and play

1590
01:51:02,320 --> 01:51:03,440
Vidhya

1591
01:51:03,920 --> 01:51:05,400
Kaalidas is aware about this.

1592
01:51:05,440 --> 01:51:07,400
But, we can't blame him.

1593
01:51:07,480 --> 01:51:10,280
Because, he too might be
depressed of the child.

1594
01:51:10,560 --> 01:51:14,080
To get rid of that,
he concentrated on the work.

1595
01:51:14,120 --> 01:51:15,320
He neglected her.

1596
01:51:17,640 --> 01:51:18,720
Why are you coming here?

1597
01:51:18,760 --> 01:51:19,920
Is this a choultry?

1598
01:51:20,440 --> 01:51:22,440
But, she missed Kaalidas a lot.

1599
01:51:22,800 --> 01:51:30,520
She gave a form to her Kaalidas
in imaginary and living with him.

1600
01:51:31,560 --> 01:51:32,440
Courier

1601
01:51:33,960 --> 01:51:34,720
Sign

1602
01:51:34,760 --> 01:51:37,320
If you come late at night,
you've to jump the wall

1603
01:51:37,400 --> 01:51:38,480
I won't come at night

1604
01:51:38,560 --> 01:51:41,120
Why? Are you going to sell
kulfi ice cream?

1605
01:51:41,240 --> 01:51:44,040
Will you sing poet Bharathi's
song for me?

1606
01:51:47,880 --> 01:51:50,200
Did she speak to you
about those four women?

1607
01:51:50,240 --> 01:51:51,520
Yeah, she told.

1608
01:51:51,560 --> 01:51:52,960
They'll say just for name sake.

1609
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:54,600
Still, it's the male dominant world.

1610
01:51:54,640 --> 01:51:55,640
Vidhya!

1611
01:51:56,680 --> 01:51:59,720
No...These people aren't good.

1612
01:51:59,760 --> 01:52:00,840
They'll separate us.

1613
01:52:00,880 --> 01:52:02,560
Don't we have a life for our own?

1614
01:52:02,600 --> 01:52:04,040
The men won't allow us.

1615
01:52:04,080 --> 01:52:05,520
We've to take ourselves.

1616
01:52:05,560 --> 01:52:09,040
Why are you missing
your happiness for his sake?

1617
01:52:09,160 --> 01:52:11,600
Vidhya, don't get along with them.

1618
01:52:11,640 --> 01:52:12,880
No problem, indeed.

1619
01:52:12,920 --> 01:52:14,280
My house is there.

1620
01:52:14,320 --> 01:52:16,240
You can use at any time.

1621
01:52:16,680 --> 01:52:18,280
Known friends are there.

1622
01:52:18,360 --> 01:52:19,880
Shall I introduce them to you?

1623
01:52:20,280 --> 01:52:21,200
Vidhya!

1624
01:52:21,520 --> 01:52:22,600
No need, Vidhya!

1625
01:52:22,640 --> 01:52:28,320
As Kaalidas didn't care her,
she too was perplexed and on dilemma.

1626
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:30,520
Vidhya is on dilemma.

1627
01:52:30,840 --> 01:52:33,960
But, the Kaalidas within her is clear.

1628
01:52:35,480 --> 01:52:37,560
He has taken control of her.

1629
01:52:46,440 --> 01:52:50,960
So, isn't it wrong betraying Das
for another relationship?

1630
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:52,920
You'll feel guilty for
a couple of times.

1631
01:52:52,960 --> 01:52:55,280
Later, you'll like that decision.

1632
01:53:16,080 --> 01:53:18,760
- Where in Manapakkam?
- Near the bridge.

1633
01:53:18,800 --> 01:53:20,520
Stay there, I'll come.

1634
01:53:28,200 --> 01:53:29,560
I know that woman, sir.

1635
01:53:29,600 --> 01:53:31,960
I've seen her with the Inspector's wife.

1636
01:53:32,400 --> 01:53:33,360
Positive.

1637
01:53:33,400 --> 01:53:36,200
As you guessed, that's not the blood
of the deceased.

1638
01:53:36,320 --> 01:53:38,000
There is a surprise element for you.

1639
01:53:38,040 --> 01:53:39,560
The murderer is a woman.

1640
01:53:39,600 --> 01:53:42,400
By the way,
do you've her blood reports?

1641
01:53:42,760 --> 01:53:43,800
I don't have.

1642
01:53:43,840 --> 01:53:44,960
But, I can help you.

1643
01:53:45,080 --> 01:53:47,240
Sir, the blood sample which you gave
is matching.

1644
01:53:47,280 --> 01:53:49,000
Kaalidas's wife, Vidhya is...

1645
01:54:30,800 --> 01:54:31,960
Pappu!

1646
01:54:36,840 --> 01:54:39,080
Okay, guys
Any special request?

1647
01:54:48,120 --> 01:54:49,160
Hi

1648
01:54:49,400 --> 01:54:50,080
Hi

1649
01:54:50,120 --> 01:54:51,280
What's your preferable song?

1650
01:54:51,320 --> 01:54:53,240
Sean Paul, Afro jack...

1651
01:54:53,280 --> 01:54:55,600
Will you sing poet Bharathi's song
for me?

1652
01:54:55,640 --> 01:54:56,680
You mean, poet Bharathi's song?

1653
01:54:56,720 --> 01:55:01,680
Night life, parties,
enjoyable job, isn't it?

1654
01:55:02,320 --> 01:55:05,480
When everyone is enjoying the party,
my job is to stand alone...

1655
01:55:05,520 --> 01:55:07,280
...at a corner in the dark.

1656
01:55:07,320 --> 01:55:08,800
I hate it to the core.

1657
01:55:08,880 --> 01:55:10,440
I'm planning to quit soon.

1658
01:55:11,440 --> 01:55:13,360
Those four women are pitiful.

1659
01:55:14,920 --> 01:55:17,120
I shouldn't have done that.

1660
01:55:22,200 --> 01:55:23,680
What was your fault?

1661
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:27,320
It's my fault,
who was within you.

1662
01:55:27,600 --> 01:55:29,560
If I might've spent the time
you asked for...

1663
01:55:29,640 --> 01:55:31,600
...all these wouldn't have happened.

1664
01:55:37,640 --> 01:55:38,680
Vidhya!

1665
01:55:42,720 --> 01:55:44,120
Am I mad?

1666
01:55:45,160 --> 01:55:47,160
Will you leave me?

1667
01:55:53,600 --> 01:55:55,760
It's hard to be with you.

1668
01:55:59,800 --> 01:56:02,720
But, I can't live without you.

1669
01:56:17,280 --> 01:56:21,360
Will you sing poet Bharathi's song
for me?

1670
01:56:22,240 --> 01:56:28,320
"In the evening, alighted on
an elevated seat"

1671
01:56:28,360 --> 01:56:34,600
"I was watching into the expanses
of the skies and the ocean"

1672
01:56:34,720 --> 01:56:40,600
"In the evening, alighted on
an elevated seat"

1673
01:56:40,640 --> 01:56:47,080
"I was watching into the expanses
of the skies and the ocean"

1674
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:02,560
"There in the far corner,"

1675
01:57:02,600 --> 01:57:11,320
"I witnessed the rainbow,
kiss and caress the ocean"

1676
01:57:11,400 --> 01:57:14,600
"There in the far corner,"

1677
01:57:14,680 --> 01:57:22,840
"I witnessed the rainbow,
kiss and caress the ocean"

1678
01:57:23,880 --> 01:57:29,680
"In the evening, alighted on
an elevated seat"

1679
01:57:29,760 --> 01:57:36,720
"I was watching into the expanses
of the skies and the ocean"

1680
01:57:48,160 --> 01:57:54,520
"Totally engrossed in the intensity
of the surrounding blueness"

1681
01:57:54,600 --> 01:58:00,720
"I had stopped realising
the passing of time"

1682
01:58:00,800 --> 01:58:06,680
"Totally engrossed in the intensity
of the surrounding blueness"

1683
01:58:06,760 --> 01:58:12,400
"I had stopped realising
the passing of time"

1684
01:58:12,720 --> 01:58:19,120
"In numerous entrancing and
mesmerizing dreams that followed..."

1685
01:58:19,160 --> 01:58:24,960
"I was in a state
where I forgot my existence"

1686
01:58:25,040 --> 01:58:31,360
"In numerous entrancing and
mesmerizing dreams that followed..."

1687
01:58:31,400 --> 01:58:36,960
"I was in a state
where I forgot my existence"

1688
01:58:37,280 --> 01:58:43,120
"I was in a state
where I forgot my existence"

1689
01:58:43,760 --> 01:58:49,560
"In the evening, alighted on
an elevated seat"

1690
01:58:49,640 --> 01:58:57,680
"I was watching into the expanses
of the skies and the ocean"
