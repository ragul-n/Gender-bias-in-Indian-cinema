00:00:48,181 --> 00:00:50,809
[SDR-Release]

2
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,762
There are some mishaps seen
in the funeraI obsequies

3
00:02:43,863 --> 00:02:45,194
performed for your younger brother

4
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:49,427
In the southern orchard where
the cremation took pIace, a crow has banged

5
00:02:49,536 --> 00:02:53,495
Its head on the branch of
a dried up tree and cried aIoud

6
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:12,381
Veera...
Pay the priest what he deserves

7
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:15,728
Hey, haut boy!

8
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:19,694
2 iII deaths have taken pIace

9
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:22,699
I intend to remind you that
the spirits of those whose funeraI rites

10
00:03:22,802 --> 00:03:27,705
...have not been performed,
wiII be wandering around

11
00:03:36,082 --> 00:03:39,051
Is there none here to Iight
the Iamp at the twiIight hour?

12
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:41,713
Where has everyone gone off to?

13
00:03:41,788 --> 00:03:43,813
ShaII I Iight the Iamp?

14
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:06,703
Who is it?

15
00:05:08,741 --> 00:05:09,708
Who is it?

16
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:34,061
Who is it, I ask!

17
00:05:36,869 --> 00:05:38,063
Who is it over there?

18
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:02,055
PIease don't harm me

19
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:53,375
Ruku's spirit that is capabIe of utter
destruction has got embodied

20
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:54,707
and it has to be feared

21
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:57,310
What is the soIution to this?

22
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:58,384
A rituaI to untie it!

23
00:06:58,484 --> 00:06:59,849
It has to be driven away

24
00:06:59,952 --> 00:07:03,979
An armor of a very strong recitation is
of utter necessity to drive away Ruku's spirit

25
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:06,455
No ordinary priest can tie up her spirit

26
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:08,925
To my knowIedge, there is onIy
1 person who is capabIe of doing this

27
00:07:09,028 --> 00:07:10,427
MadapiIIy Bhattathiri!

28
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:17,455
Greetings to you...
PIease, come in

29
00:08:49,161 --> 00:08:53,188
You expected not to be traced
if you hide in water inside the weII!

30
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:54,857
- Come out!
- I wiII not!

31
00:08:55,034 --> 00:09:00,870
You wiII come out!
I wiII bring you out...

32
00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:15,144
I know how to get you here!

33
00:09:17,957 --> 00:09:21,518
You, MadapiIIy Bhattathiri,
Iet me see how smart you are

34
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:26,926
You wish to chaIIenge me
But, you have no right to...

35
00:09:27,099 --> 00:09:31,058
God has appointed me to ground you
and I am fuIfiIIing my task

36
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:37,507
This sorcerous pot is your ceII forever
I, order you to enter into it

37
00:10:53,886 --> 00:11:00,519
Years Iater...a viIIage in Karnataka

38
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:26,516
Mukundan Unni and his friends are

39
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:27,910
Just Iook at the cuItivation!

40
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:29,521
Sir, they are reaI cunning ones

41
00:11:29,755 --> 00:11:30,949
So, their crops wiII be the best too

42
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:33,115
They have taken the Iand on rent
and got it cuItivated

43
00:11:36,562 --> 00:11:39,895
They had rented our Iand
and cuItivated it too

44
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:41,398
But, there is not even grass growing

45
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,899
That is because of their smartness

46
00:11:43,002 --> 00:11:45,232
They cannot be trusted one bit

47
00:11:45,337 --> 00:11:47,134
You trust them, don't you?

48
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:48,831
Yes sir, I do trust them!

49
00:11:49,942 --> 00:11:53,400
Mukundan Unni, himseIf has stamped
on this white paper

50
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:54,946
Go ahead and boIdIy cut it down
I am there with you, isn't it!

51
00:11:55,081 --> 00:11:56,173
That is aII we need

52
00:11:56,282 --> 00:11:59,149
It is definiteIy more than the rent
that they have to pay us

53
00:11:59,251 --> 00:12:01,219
He wiII take care...in case of
any further probIems

54
00:12:01,353 --> 00:12:02,285
Yes, I wiII handIe it

55
00:12:02,354 --> 00:12:04,117
Cut it aII down!

56
00:12:07,493 --> 00:12:09,825
Nice, ripe sugarcanes

57
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:12,724
You wiII definiteIy make
some good profits in this

58
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:16,734
Not just a good profit
An extremeIy good profit shouId be made

59
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:23,470
Laborers again!

60
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:25,373
We have enough aIready

61
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:28,744
With whose permission
are you cutting these?

62
00:12:28,848 --> 00:12:29,940
Gopure...

63
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:31,016
What do they mean to say?

64
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,744
With whose permission
are you cutting the sugarcanes?

65
00:12:32,852 --> 00:12:34,513
We have asked yourfathers
for the permission

66
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:39,514
Show them the paper
that Mukundan Unni has signed on

67
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:41,821
What are they saying?

68
00:12:41,894 --> 00:12:44,454
- Why make a fuss?
- Get Iost

69
00:12:44,563 --> 00:12:49,398
How dare you touch
the sugarcane in MaIIIaiah's fieId?

70
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:50,059
What is he saying?

71
00:12:50,169 --> 00:12:51,761
Sir, ask him to get me down...

72
00:12:51,904 --> 00:12:53,531
Is that why he has been
barking for so Iong!

73
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:54,837
Get him down!

74
00:12:55,508 --> 00:12:57,271
They have understood what you've
spoken about their fathers

75
00:12:57,476 --> 00:12:59,034
This Iand does not
beIong to Mukundan Unni

76
00:12:59,178 --> 00:13:00,304
He has cheated us

77
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:02,209
Run for your Iife!

78
00:13:02,314 --> 00:13:03,372
Big brother!

79
00:13:04,984 --> 00:13:07,714
Mukundan Unni, I wiII not spare you

80
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:08,445
Let us do that Iater

81
00:13:08,554 --> 00:13:09,418
We need to escape
from here right now

82
00:13:09,488 --> 00:13:11,718
Or eIse, they wiII not spare us

83
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:13,917
Yes, we shouId not bow
our heads in front of anyone

84
00:13:14,026 --> 00:13:16,324
You are right!
Run away!

85
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:37,813
Cold winds off cool rivers, come along with me
Sing a song to awaken the Koel deep in sleep

86
00:13:37,917 --> 00:13:42,013
The soft missed has faded,
come out little woman

87
00:13:42,121 --> 00:13:46,217
Let's step out of the mist to go to fields

88
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:55,029
We can adorn our hairwith jasmine flowers

89
00:14:15,087 --> 00:14:21,048
Oh my girl, the sky yonder east
Reddened like vermilion vial splashed its dye

90
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:27,121
On the hill tops of Ambarathi, ahoy!
There's a light shining that's amazing

91
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:33,194
Oh lovely earth, one touch and it yields
My dear girl reap its rich harvests and come

92
00:14:33,305 --> 00:14:39,540
Waiting in the fields to clap in rhythm
My girl, with the beating of drums, she sings

93
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:45,773
Celebration of festival of dreams
let's all get together

94
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:51,482
Come laughing and in joy,
don't tempt me my girl

95
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:57,518
Oh my girl, the sky yonder east
Reddened like vermilion vial splashed its dye

96
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:27,893
Thumping hooves of cattle in rhythm
Bronze bells in accompanying tinkle

97
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:40,132
Under shady tress of country side
sounds of breeze whispering sweet nothings

98
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:43,231
Our town gets ready with beating hearts

99
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:46,243
Resounding sounds of drums,
my curly haired girl

100
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:49,314
Howdah, on elephant,
umbrella swaying joyously

101
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:52,475
Town full of decorated umbrellas
unfolding in welcome

102
00:15:52,584 --> 00:15:58,523
Celebration of festival of dreams
let's all get together

103
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:04,423
Come laughing and in joy,
don't tempt me my girl

104
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:10,469
Oh my girl, the sky yonder east
Reddened like vermilion vial splashed its dye

105
00:16:10,569 --> 00:16:13,299
Oh look my girl,
the buds and flowers blossoming

106
00:16:13,405 --> 00:16:16,738
Look how beautiful they are
in the valley and fields

107
00:16:16,842 --> 00:16:19,333
Heaps of flowers plucked
into baskets and bowls

108
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:23,006
Adorning the festival-car
along the temple paths

109
00:16:47,106 --> 00:16:53,067
Singing streams of rivulets crafted for you
Silver beaded ornament to adorn the waist

110
00:16:56,215 --> 00:17:01,847
The summer sun too turns beautiful
Wearing her veil of woven gold

111
00:17:01,954 --> 00:17:05,219
A beautiful veil of woven gold

112
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:11,354
To adorn the body of mist with red vermilion
l shall give you my girl with beautiful eyes

113
00:17:11,463 --> 00:17:15,365
Stars yearned to tinkle
like bells of your anklets

114
00:17:15,467 --> 00:17:17,765
Oh pretty girl with pretty flowers in hair

115
00:17:17,936 --> 00:17:23,932
Celebration of festival of dreams
let's all get together

116
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:29,538
Come laughing and in joy,
don't tempt me my girl

117
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:35,743
Oh my girl, the sky yonder east
Reddened like vermilion vial splashed its dye

118
00:17:35,854 --> 00:17:41,793
On the hill tops of Ambarathi, ahoy!
There's a light shining that's amazing

119
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:47,855
Oh lovely earth, one touch and it yields
My dear girl reap its rich harvests and come

120
00:17:47,966 --> 00:17:54,337
Waiting in the fields to clap in rhythm
My girl, with the beating of drums, she sings

121
00:17:54,440 --> 00:18:00,436
Celebration of festival of dreams
let's all get together

122
00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:06,542
Come laughing and in joy,
don't tempt me my girl

123
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,092
What is this?

124
00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:23,158
What eIse do you need?

125
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:24,467
Legs of Ramba (a South Indian actress)

126
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:25,764
Legs of Ramba...

127
00:18:25,871 --> 00:18:27,532
Here it is!
Check it out

128
00:18:31,009 --> 00:18:32,499
Eyes of Kareena Kapoor
(a North Indian actress)

129
00:18:33,812 --> 00:18:34,744
Take this

130
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:36,413
Use the gum

131
00:18:36,515 --> 00:18:37,209
Why can't I stick it Iike this?

132
00:18:37,316 --> 00:18:40,149
It is such a sweet thing
But, it wiII get spoiIed if a dog Iicks it

133
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:41,884
Dog is your...

134
00:18:42,921 --> 00:18:44,081
Where is Ramba's other Ieg?

135
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:47,056
Isn't this the other Ieg?
Can't you recognize it?

136
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,150
Isn't this the one?

137
00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:50,452
Yes, it is aIright now

138
00:18:50,562 --> 00:18:54,464
Mukundan Unni, there are
some more bits to be found

139
00:18:54,566 --> 00:18:57,228
This is not a porn movie
So, Iet it be...

140
00:18:57,769 --> 00:18:59,464
Why is Aishwarya Rai's nose cut off?

141
00:18:59,571 --> 00:19:00,970
I've been cutting this aII night

142
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:04,304
My fingers have got cut and
you are not bothered about it

143
00:19:04,376 --> 00:19:05,468
- Get Iost!
- You, get Iost!

144
00:19:05,577 --> 00:19:07,545
So, our Damayanti (a woman Iike a queen)
is ready

145
00:19:07,846 --> 00:19:11,282
It was a fake story but this is
what they got fIattered with

146
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:13,475
Why did you make up
a character Iike this?

147
00:19:13,585 --> 00:19:17,214
Otherwise, I had to pay
a sum of 1.5 Iakhs

148
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:17,812
To the queen?

149
00:19:17,923 --> 00:19:20,357
No...to those peopIe coming now!
Run away...

150
00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:21,892
- Why?
- Just run

151
00:19:22,394 --> 00:19:23,486
Oh no!

152
00:19:24,563 --> 00:19:25,894
Stop it

153
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:29,323
Hey, don't Iet them go
Catch hoId of them

154
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:31,995
Don't run away...

155
00:19:37,242 --> 00:19:38,334
You tried to escape?

156
00:19:38,443 --> 00:19:40,468
No, I did not mean to escape

157
00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:41,375
Why did you run away from us?

158
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,469
I did not run away...

159
00:19:42,581 --> 00:19:43,479
Why did we see you run?

160
00:19:43,582 --> 00:19:44,742
ShaII I teII you the truth?

161
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,011
- Can you pIease speak the truth?
- I wiII!

162
00:19:47,085 --> 00:19:47,449
PIease do

163
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:50,147
Can you aII move away?
I want to taIk to the oIder brother

164
00:19:50,255 --> 00:19:51,984
Go away

165
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:53,754
What is it?

166
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:55,554
Do not be surprised

167
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:57,920
Damayanti sent her picture yesterday

168
00:19:59,097 --> 00:20:02,464
Subramaniam chased me
to get hoId of the picture

169
00:20:02,568 --> 00:20:04,126
MeanwhiIe, the picture
got torn amidst the chaos

170
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:06,500
Have you grown big enough
to tear Damayanti's picture?

171
00:20:06,572 --> 00:20:07,834
Grandmother...

172
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:08,770
Why caII your grandmother?!

173
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,432
My mother is no more...

174
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:12,908
Stop weeping and go inside

175
00:20:13,011 --> 00:20:13,978
Get Iost, you idiot!

176
00:20:14,146 --> 00:20:16,444
Sir, pIease adjust with this nose

177
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:17,207
OnIy the nose?

178
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:19,840
Damayanti, herseIf wiII be coming here

179
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:20,850
WiII she not have a nose?

180
00:20:20,953 --> 00:20:23,547
She wiII have it
It wiII bIoom in 2 days

181
00:20:23,822 --> 00:20:24,914
What is it?

182
00:20:25,023 --> 00:20:30,120
He was asking me about the right
manure for the sugarcanes

183
00:20:30,963 --> 00:20:32,453
Damayanti had caIIed up yesterday

184
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:34,725
She was reaIIy impressed
when I spoke about you

185
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,892
What did she say?

186
00:20:36,034 --> 00:20:40,437
Mukundan Unni, is my little boss
doing fine?

187
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:42,199
I am getting aII those goose-bumps...

188
00:20:42,274 --> 00:20:43,832
Don't finish of aII the goose-bumps now

189
00:20:43,942 --> 00:20:45,466
Leave some of it to be used when she,
herseIf is here finaIIy

190
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:46,475
What is it?

191
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:48,478
'Nandini' (the cow), has started
getting her uterine contractions

192
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,741
So, I was consuIting with him whether
to treat her with home remedies or

193
00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:52,146
...take her to the veterinary doctor
for the injections

194
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:54,347
What do you suggest?

195
00:20:54,786 --> 00:20:56,754
You are the Iuckiest man
in the whoIe worId

196
00:20:56,855 --> 00:20:59,016
- Why is it so?
- Damayanti has never seen you

197
00:20:59,157 --> 00:21:02,684
What is it that you have,
that has impressed her so much?

198
00:21:02,794 --> 00:21:03,351
Pressure!

199
00:21:03,462 --> 00:21:04,292
Pressure?...

200
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:06,863
I've got a high bIood pressure
So, don't tense me...teII me what it is

201
00:21:06,965 --> 00:21:09,433
Damayanti wiII be soon
coming to Iive with you

202
00:21:09,534 --> 00:21:10,159
When wiII she come?

203
00:21:10,235 --> 00:21:13,033
Whenever you want herto
But, I need to go fetch her

204
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:16,370
I do not have money for the bus fare
How can I go, get her?

205
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:17,430
Okay, so, that is the issue right now

206
00:21:17,509 --> 00:21:21,912
You expected me to be
the same as my brothers...

207
00:21:23,215 --> 00:21:24,239
This ring weighs a sovereign

208
00:21:24,316 --> 00:21:27,808
SeII this and go, get her
Take care of aII her needs

209
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:28,886
My brothers shouId not
know about this

210
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:29,921
I wiII not teII them even
if I'm threatened to be kiIIed

211
00:21:29,988 --> 00:21:34,186
I wiII kiII you if they come to know

212
00:21:34,326 --> 00:21:38,763
- Come here and get into the vehicIe
- Carry on...

213
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:41,196
Start the vehicIe

214
00:21:42,768 --> 00:21:46,329
Go on, swinging your hands...

215
00:21:47,873 --> 00:21:49,738
He, who came Iike a tiger
went off Iike a rat

216
00:21:49,841 --> 00:21:50,500
Did you see that?

217
00:21:50,575 --> 00:21:52,202
I got this one sovereign ring
without much hassIe

218
00:21:52,277 --> 00:21:53,744
This can fetch me 25,000

219
00:21:53,845 --> 00:21:55,278
25,000...?

220
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:59,111
I know of aII your hardships

221
00:21:59,584 --> 00:22:02,485
PIease don't think that I'm teIIing you this
onIy because you have got money now

222
00:22:02,587 --> 00:22:06,353
- What is it?
- My grandmother is not weII

223
00:22:06,591 --> 00:22:11,995
The major has recommended
a commando operation in her eye

224
00:22:12,064 --> 00:22:14,123
PIease give me this ring...

225
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:19,031
- If not, I aIso know how to steaI it
- What's wrong?

226
00:22:19,104 --> 00:22:22,471
You were in need of money
for your sister's coIIege fees, isn't it?

227
00:22:22,574 --> 00:22:24,405
- Take this
- What about your needs?

228
00:22:24,543 --> 00:22:29,173
Life is easy when we have peopIe Iike
the Nettikadan brothers in our viIIage

229
00:22:55,474 --> 00:22:58,170
Don't fiII your tummy with aII these
There is yam and other tubers too

230
00:22:58,276 --> 00:22:59,937
Yam is too itchy

231
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:04,144
You, corpse...

232
00:23:05,117 --> 00:23:08,553
The crops are not too great this time

233
00:23:08,787 --> 00:23:09,549
You are sounding Iike as though

234
00:23:09,788 --> 00:23:12,313
...the cuItivation was extremeIy
good during the past 2 years

235
00:23:12,424 --> 00:23:15,086
Why is it that, the vegetabIes in our farm

236
00:23:15,193 --> 00:23:18,492
...are getting thinner by the day,
Iike the peopIe in SomaIia?

237
00:23:18,597 --> 00:23:23,034
You shouId buy some good,
nutritionaI manure for the crops

238
00:23:23,268 --> 00:23:24,462
I had asked you to drop
some cow dung there

239
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:26,196
Am I a cow to drop dung?

240
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:27,435
Don't give me that Iook

241
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:29,507
It is not enough if you dress up
in denims and waIk in styIe

242
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:32,839
You shouId go to the fieIds
and toiI there too

243
00:23:32,944 --> 00:23:34,172
Do you consider yourseIf a hero?

244
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:35,541
I am reaIIy tensed right now

245
00:23:35,814 --> 00:23:38,248
ShouId I be thinking of
the cuItivation or my hunger?

246
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:53,530
AppIy the brakes!

247
00:24:07,512 --> 00:24:09,742
You are crying
as if you have been hit

248
00:24:09,848 --> 00:24:11,475
Go, get the first aid box from the car

249
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:12,743
The car does not have
the proper registration papers

250
00:24:12,851 --> 00:24:14,148
How wiII it have a first aid box?

251
00:24:14,553 --> 00:24:15,485
What do we do now?

252
00:24:15,587 --> 00:24:18,055
Let us abscond if no one has seen us

253
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:21,024
But, they have seen us

254
00:24:30,535 --> 00:24:31,797
Why are they running away?

255
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:33,963
They do not want to be witnesses
to this murder

256
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:36,064
- Murder?....
- Yes, here it is

257
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:38,467
Let us take her to the hospitaI

258
00:24:38,577 --> 00:24:40,738
The hospitaI authorities
wiII hand us over to the poIice

259
00:24:40,846 --> 00:24:42,040
Let us take her
to the poIice station, instead

260
00:24:42,214 --> 00:24:43,977
The poIice wiII beat us up
and take us to the hospitaI

261
00:24:44,082 --> 00:24:46,243
- What for?
- First is, abuse

262
00:24:46,351 --> 00:24:48,114
SecondIy, if she regains consciousness
and cIaims that you attempted

263
00:24:48,253 --> 00:24:50,153
to rape her, you wiII get caught no doubt

264
00:24:50,255 --> 00:24:51,313
But, I have not attempted it

265
00:24:51,423 --> 00:24:55,382
These days, it is a trend to cIaim
that rape has been attempted

266
00:24:55,527 --> 00:24:56,459
You wiII get caught!

267
00:24:56,595 --> 00:24:57,527
What do we do now?

268
00:24:57,596 --> 00:24:59,496
Let us take herto ourfarm house now

269
00:24:59,598 --> 00:25:00,462
What is that for?

270
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:02,760
When she gets conscious,
we can find out what the probIem is

271
00:25:02,868 --> 00:25:05,359
We can take money from her, cIaiming
that the jeep has to be repaired

272
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:07,028
- What if she does not Ieave then?
- We can abduct her then

273
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:07,467
Huh?...

274
00:25:07,572 --> 00:25:09,904
We wiII scare her and force herto go away
Lift her!

275
00:25:29,427 --> 00:25:31,224
How can you park the car
in the middIe of the road?

276
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:32,261
Where do you Iook whiIe you drive?

277
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:35,322
- Move away!
- Where are you off to?

278
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:39,325
- What do you want?
- I wiII show you what I want

279
00:25:39,604 --> 00:25:40,866
Who are you and what do you want?

280
00:25:40,939 --> 00:25:41,997
I asked you to move away

281
00:25:42,073 --> 00:25:43,233
Take this to the car

282
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:46,739
I wiII not aIIow you to take it
I have toiIed hard to grow these VegetabIes

283
00:25:46,845 --> 00:25:50,246
It is aII organic

284
00:25:50,348 --> 00:25:51,906
What are you fighting for?

285
00:25:53,084 --> 00:25:53,846
Get into the vehicIe

286
00:25:54,953 --> 00:25:56,443
There is bIood on your face!

287
00:25:57,022 --> 00:25:58,455
Is it tomato paste on yours'?

288
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:00,149
Come, Iet us fight them...

289
00:26:43,234 --> 00:26:46,397
He has faIIen down
What do we do now?

290
00:26:46,504 --> 00:26:47,562
Let us Ieave

291
00:26:57,949 --> 00:27:01,077
We have reached our pIace
Hope it was a comfortabIe journey

292
00:27:01,186 --> 00:27:03,120
Yes, shaII we go on another ride?

293
00:27:03,221 --> 00:27:05,553
I wiII smash you now
Carry her down

294
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:06,916
What are you doing?

295
00:27:07,592 --> 00:27:09,287
You can hoId the Iegs
and I wiII come that way

296
00:27:10,028 --> 00:27:11,893
Be carefuI, don't drop her down

297
00:27:11,997 --> 00:27:14,557
HoId that part!

298
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:15,561
Isn't this the Ieg?

299
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,427
No, it is not the Ieg
HoId herfeet

300
00:27:17,535 --> 00:27:21,904
Chicken Iegs for him
and girIs' Iegs for me

301
00:27:22,007 --> 00:27:24,271
- They wiII easiIy break at this age
- Where is south for us?

302
00:27:24,376 --> 00:27:25,468
Are you going to bury her here?

303
00:27:25,543 --> 00:27:27,374
I want to keep her head
towards the south

304
00:27:27,512 --> 00:27:32,074
You have staIked a girI from some
good famiIy, taken her to some guest house

305
00:27:32,183 --> 00:27:37,485
...promising to marry her,
raped her to make her pregnant and

306
00:27:37,555 --> 00:27:40,956
...somehow brought her here
on the way to getting her kiIIed

307
00:27:41,059 --> 00:27:42,390
I wiII not stand by you forthis

308
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:45,190
- I wish to teII you aII...
- Go and get some water

309
00:27:45,263 --> 00:27:48,232
Okay, there is Iiquortoo!
I wiII preferthe soda in my drink

310
00:27:48,299 --> 00:27:50,460
Go, get some water
to sprinkIe on her face

311
00:27:50,568 --> 00:27:51,762
Oh, is that it?

312
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:54,937
Is she dead?

313
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:57,566
No, the thing inside is beating hard

314
00:27:57,842 --> 00:27:58,831
You are Iying...

315
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:00,810
- No, I mean it!
- Let me check too

316
00:28:00,879 --> 00:28:04,042
That is not necessary,
you can hear it through my ears

317
00:28:04,115 --> 00:28:05,377
I don't want to hear it

318
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:07,850
No fun when I hear it
through your ear

319
00:28:07,952 --> 00:28:10,386
- Don't rub it too much, Ieave it...
- Here's the water

320
00:28:11,222 --> 00:28:12,416
SprinkIe it

321
00:28:12,824 --> 00:28:13,756
Is it stuck?

322
00:28:13,892 --> 00:28:15,291
PuII it...

323
00:28:15,593 --> 00:28:17,561
Pour it through the space

324
00:28:18,596 --> 00:28:20,564
Turn it and pour it out

325
00:28:33,011 --> 00:28:34,535
Who is it over there?

326
00:28:43,188 --> 00:28:43,950
Who are you?

327
00:28:44,022 --> 00:28:46,115
This poor souI can't be seen

328
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:47,521
This is his face

329
00:28:47,792 --> 00:28:49,885
Turn off the torch
before she faints again

330
00:28:50,095 --> 00:28:51,084
Who are you aII?

331
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:54,528
What a reIief!
I am Mukundan Unni

332
00:28:55,834 --> 00:28:58,268
- What is your name?
- Name...

333
00:28:58,503 --> 00:29:04,533
Sindhu, Reshma,
Maria, Santha, ViIasini?

334
00:29:04,809 --> 00:29:08,245
Can you pIease keep quiet?
What is there in a name?

335
00:29:08,346 --> 00:29:12,305
- Where do you Iive?
- My house...

336
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:18,522
This is my house
TeII me what you are here for and Ieave

337
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:19,557
Come on, Iet us go

338
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:22,491
Are you acting this out?
Get out and Ieave

339
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:24,994
Where do I go to?
Isn't this my house?

340
00:29:25,063 --> 00:29:26,826
- No!
- Why have you kidnapped me?

341
00:29:26,898 --> 00:29:30,299
We have not kidnapped you
We brought you here after a jeep hit you

342
00:29:30,401 --> 00:29:32,892
You tried to kiII me
by hitting me with a jeep?

343
00:29:33,037 --> 00:29:36,336
I had warned you
not to bring her here

344
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:37,305
Madness

345
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:39,502
- Madness!
- She is mad!

346
00:29:39,878 --> 00:29:41,778
Can pretty girIs Iike this go mad?

347
00:29:41,846 --> 00:29:44,007
Madness doesn't Iook at
how pretty the person is

348
00:29:44,082 --> 00:29:46,414
Narayanan used to Iook Iike
Aamir Khan (a BoIIywood hero)

349
00:29:46,518 --> 00:29:47,507
Is it so?

350
00:29:47,585 --> 00:29:49,450
So, are you Aamir Khan?

351
00:29:49,554 --> 00:29:53,320
If Aamir Khan was to hearthis,
he wouId have shot you dead

352
00:29:53,858 --> 00:29:54,159
Stop there!

353
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:57,128
Stop there!

354
00:29:57,862 --> 00:30:00,160
I wiII kiII you
if you make a noise

355
00:30:00,231 --> 00:30:00,959
Sit down!

356
00:30:01,065 --> 00:30:04,523
If we had not rescued you, those guys
wouId have destroyed you by now

357
00:30:04,602 --> 00:30:05,466
Learn to be gratefuI

358
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:06,901
The Nettikadans are here

359
00:30:07,038 --> 00:30:08,972
If they get hoId of her,
she wiII be dead soon

360
00:30:09,073 --> 00:30:11,371
- We must keep her in hiding
- Where do we keep her?.

361
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:13,410
Open the Iarge chest

362
00:30:13,845 --> 00:30:15,506
Get in faster

363
00:30:16,247 --> 00:30:17,271
Go inside

364
00:30:17,882 --> 00:30:19,975
I wiII aIso give her company

365
00:30:20,051 --> 00:30:21,382
I wiII give you company too

366
00:30:21,452 --> 00:30:22,851
- Not necessary
- ShaII I come in?

367
00:30:22,954 --> 00:30:25,149
It is aIready too dark inside

368
00:30:27,892 --> 00:30:31,760
Stop there!
Where is Mukundan Unni?

369
00:30:31,863 --> 00:30:34,423
He wiII get back by the train
that comes at 10:30

370
00:30:34,532 --> 00:30:36,261
- Which train is that?
- I do not know about that

371
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:37,926
He wiII come on the Jayanti

372
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:39,970
He toId us about Damayanti
Is there a Jayanthi too?

373
00:30:40,071 --> 00:30:42,471
Jayanti is the name of a train

374
00:30:42,907 --> 00:30:46,274
I don't mind seeing even the train
It's a nice name

375
00:30:46,377 --> 00:30:50,040
Whose bedroom is this?

376
00:30:50,148 --> 00:30:54,084
This is not a bedroom
It is a wedding auditorium

377
00:30:54,152 --> 00:30:57,087
In the evening,
they serve food for 2000 peopIe

378
00:30:57,188 --> 00:30:59,213
We need to get out before that

379
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:01,120
Is it our marriage?

380
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:07,091
What was that noise?

381
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:09,962
That's Mukundan's cat,
trying to catch a mouse

382
00:31:10,101 --> 00:31:13,468
I have never seen
a cat catch a mouse

383
00:31:13,571 --> 00:31:16,540
- Can I see it now?
- No, the cat wiII not Iike that

384
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:21,944
We are not Ieaving this pIace
tiII we see Mukundan

385
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:25,140
- Don't we have to see the bank manager?
-Ask the bank manager to get Iost

386
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:29,550
- That Iady wiII be upset, sir!
- Lady?...

387
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:31,753
Come on, Iet's go

388
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:35,992
They have gone
Come out

389
00:31:37,428 --> 00:31:40,829
Thank goodness, they have gone

390
00:31:40,932 --> 00:31:42,763
Come out

391
00:31:42,834 --> 00:31:44,563
Why are you Iooking guiIty?

392
00:31:44,836 --> 00:31:48,033
Did something happen
inside the chest?

393
00:31:48,139 --> 00:31:51,438
- With my right hand in this pot
- Did your Ieft hand go, pIucking mangoes?

394
00:31:51,509 --> 00:31:54,410
This dog hugged me tight

395
00:31:54,512 --> 00:31:56,275
- I had expected this
- Why is it so?

396
00:31:56,381 --> 00:32:01,785
WiII a famined dog eat mutton biryani
served to it orthrow it off?

397
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:06,387
Throw it off...
Not the biryani, but this specimen!

398
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:18,068
Look at him

399
00:32:18,369 --> 00:32:20,303
Was this journey comfortabIe too?

400
00:32:20,405 --> 00:32:23,431
WouId have been nice to have
more of the guttered roads

401
00:32:24,008 --> 00:32:25,134
Lift her up

402
00:32:25,243 --> 00:32:27,404
You can taIk Ioud
She wiII not wake up

403
00:32:27,478 --> 00:32:30,106
Wake up... you pretty queen

404
00:32:30,315 --> 00:32:33,011
I made her steamed rice cakes using
50 sIeeping piIIs

405
00:32:33,084 --> 00:32:35,177
She wiII sIeep continuousIy
forthe next 8 to 10 hours

406
00:32:35,253 --> 00:32:37,016
Go, check if it's safe up there

407
00:32:37,188 --> 00:32:38,485
- You have to come too
- Why so?

408
00:32:38,589 --> 00:32:42,787
She wiII not be safe aIone with you
She might even have a baby soon

409
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:46,761
There is no man or animaI in a diameter
of 26km around this pIace

410
00:32:46,864 --> 00:32:48,957
That is the reason I chose this pIace

411
00:32:49,033 --> 00:32:50,557
It is safe here too

412
00:32:50,835 --> 00:32:51,893
How wiII she go from here?

413
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:55,906
If she wakes up, she wiII have to waIk
30km down the mountain to catch a bus

414
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:59,840
If this was your motive,
why did you bring her home?

415
00:32:59,944 --> 00:33:02,913
We didn't go searching for it
It just happened to us

416
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:06,280
We can be sure that, there is
nothing wrong with her body

417
00:33:06,351 --> 00:33:07,545
But, there is something wrong
with her brains

418
00:33:07,618 --> 00:33:10,485
That might be a congenitaI defect
It need not be caused by the accident

419
00:33:10,588 --> 00:33:14,547
It is evident that, she is a girI who
has gone through severaI probIems

420
00:33:14,892 --> 00:33:17,986
Amidst aII our current probIems, do we
have to entertain another one Iike this?

421
00:33:18,096 --> 00:33:19,529
- Not necessary!
- You can, if you want to

422
00:33:19,597 --> 00:33:23,089
No, not at aII...
There is a car going...

423
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:24,528
- Where?
- Down there

424
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:27,471
Looks simiIarto ours', isn't it?

425
00:33:27,538 --> 00:33:29,768
You toId there are no cars
passing by this pIace

426
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:30,899
See for yourseIf, now

427
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:34,573
- Is that our vehicIe?
- Yes, it might be ours'

428
00:33:34,812 --> 00:33:39,579
She's going away with our vehicIe
Stop there!...

429
00:33:42,954 --> 00:33:45,252
Stop the car, you donkey!

430
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:51,461
You ride weII

431
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:53,793
There is another person
who rides weII too

432
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:55,799
- Who is that?
- Your father!

433
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:01,403
That's her

434
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:07,507
Isn't she dead yet?

435
00:34:07,612 --> 00:34:10,046
No...
But, I wiII kiII her now

436
00:34:17,155 --> 00:34:19,350
Mukundan, she's got water with her
So, be carefuI

437
00:34:19,457 --> 00:34:22,187
I'II thrash you

438
00:34:22,326 --> 00:34:26,524
We took care of you Iike goId
and you abandoned us Iike grass

439
00:34:26,931 --> 00:34:29,559
I know who wanted to abandon whom

440
00:34:29,801 --> 00:34:30,927
You are aII tired

441
00:34:31,035 --> 00:34:32,559
ShaII I serve you those rice cakes
made with sIeeping piIIs?

442
00:34:32,837 --> 00:34:34,327
Get the knife and not the rice cakes

443
00:34:34,439 --> 00:34:36,168
Who gave you the permission
to wear my cIothes?

444
00:34:36,307 --> 00:34:37,797
He asked me to get ready and so I did

445
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:39,308
- Who asked you to get ready?
- Kovur!

446
00:34:39,377 --> 00:34:42,210
- Which Kovur?
- Oh... Kovur!...

447
00:34:42,313 --> 00:34:45,407
- He asked me if I am Damayanti
- What did you teII him?

448
00:34:45,516 --> 00:34:47,381
I admitted that I am Damayanti

449
00:34:48,219 --> 00:34:51,814
He toId he wiII come
in the morning with his bosses

450
00:34:53,191 --> 00:34:55,352
What do we teII the Nettikadans tomorrow?

451
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:56,290
What is there to teII them

452
00:34:56,394 --> 00:35:01,161
She has owned up that she is Damayanti
Let it remain that way

453
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:03,495
She is Damayanti for the Nettikadans

454
00:35:03,568 --> 00:35:04,762
WiII that be aIright?

455
00:35:04,836 --> 00:35:07,805
Yes, it wiII be aIright
Or eIse, we wiII set it right

456
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,373
She wiII set it right

457
00:35:11,042 --> 00:35:17,038
BIack bangIes...
or Iotus Ieaves...

458
00:35:18,316 --> 00:35:21,183
I wiII gift Damayanti,
a goId bangIe today

459
00:35:26,991 --> 00:35:32,486
I Iook so mascuIine
Damayanti wiII faII forthis

460
00:35:33,197 --> 00:35:38,396
WiII something happen today?

461
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:45,475
The 3rd Nettikadan brother is on his way...
to see you, Damayanti

462
00:35:52,583 --> 00:35:54,574
- Where are you off to?
- Yes, where are you off to?

463
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:55,581
I am asking you

464
00:35:55,686 --> 00:35:56,584
Where are you off to, big brother?

465
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:57,981
I am going to get some bangIes

466
00:35:58,055 --> 00:36:00,580
I mean...Kovur caIIed up saying
that the manure has come

467
00:36:00,858 --> 00:36:02,291
So, I am going for it
Where are you off to?

468
00:36:02,393 --> 00:36:06,124
- I am going to get some insecticides
- How about you?

469
00:36:06,197 --> 00:36:08,893
Where am I going to?
To the workshop...

470
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,494
The tractor engine is making a noise
So, have to change the oiI

471
00:36:13,604 --> 00:36:16,300
Both of you are going aIone
Do get back as soon as your works are done

472
00:36:16,407 --> 00:36:17,431
You too, big brother!

473
00:36:19,443 --> 00:36:22,105
- It was not on purpose
- You don't have to teII me anything

474
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:26,014
It was reaIIy cheap of us to have taken
5 Iakhs from the Nettikadans quoting

475
00:36:26,117 --> 00:36:27,243
Damayanti as the excuse

476
00:36:27,318 --> 00:36:29,013
I am feeIing guiIty about it

477
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,382
I wiII avoid it now

478
00:36:30,454 --> 00:36:31,944
I wiII kiII you
if you avoid it now

479
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:36,084
Why do you take 5 or 6?
Can't you take 10 or 20 at once?

480
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,889
I wiII do that the next time

481
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:39,860
With so much of money invoIved,
wiII she act weII?

482
00:36:39,931 --> 00:36:43,867
In the 7th grade, she won the first pIace,
acting as a witch

483
00:36:43,968 --> 00:36:47,199
She need not act Iike a witch
She can just Iive it

484
00:36:48,306 --> 00:36:51,036
The Nettikadans have come

485
00:36:51,242 --> 00:36:52,470
He's running towards us

486
00:36:52,577 --> 00:36:54,101
He's not running,
he has come in his jeep

487
00:36:54,178 --> 00:36:55,145
Have you gone bIind?

488
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:59,115
You are bIind...
Has he come too?

489
00:36:59,183 --> 00:37:01,083
- He is the one who has come
- What about this one?

490
00:37:01,152 --> 00:37:04,781
Oh no, big brother is aIso here

491
00:37:04,855 --> 00:37:06,117
Didn't you go for the insecticides?

492
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:07,919
I decided to come and get
the interest money from them, before I go

493
00:37:08,025 --> 00:37:09,083
I wiII get the interest
You can Ieave

494
00:37:09,193 --> 00:37:10,558
You can Ieave, big brother

495
00:37:10,628 --> 00:37:11,754
I am asking you to Ieave

496
00:37:11,862 --> 00:37:13,762
I've decided that I'II not Ieave this pIace
before I get the interest from them

497
00:37:13,864 --> 00:37:14,558
Get Iost!

498
00:37:14,799 --> 00:37:16,562
Don't try to boss over me

499
00:37:16,801 --> 00:37:17,825
You are bossing over me

500
00:37:17,935 --> 00:37:19,232
There comes the next one too

501
00:37:19,804 --> 00:37:21,066
Why have you come here?

502
00:37:21,205 --> 00:37:23,799
- Why are you here, brothers?
- We have come for the interest

503
00:37:23,874 --> 00:37:26,104
I have aIso come for the same

504
00:37:26,177 --> 00:37:29,237
Their aim is not the interest
It is the weaIth that is inside the house

505
00:37:29,313 --> 00:37:31,008
The 3 of them are here together,

506
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:33,414
It wiII be sheer Iuck if at Ieast
her teeth and naiIs are Ieft behind

507
00:37:33,484 --> 00:37:34,849
It wiII be difficuIt

508
00:37:37,188 --> 00:37:38,086
Tea...

509
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:47,257
What a weaIth this is!

510
00:37:47,498 --> 00:37:49,762
I wiII take even
the interest for this one

511
00:38:12,023 --> 00:38:15,584
Mukundan, this is not just a queen
She is a goddess!

512
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:17,452
- Cough syrup?...
- Get Iost!

513
00:38:17,561 --> 00:38:20,826
- I Iike aII the 3 of you
- Me too!

514
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,998
I want to marry too
But, there is a probIem

515
00:38:27,104 --> 00:38:28,765
What is the probIem?

516
00:38:28,839 --> 00:38:31,933
The Indian government does not aIIow it

517
00:38:32,343 --> 00:38:34,311
- Who made that ruIe?
-Ambedkar!

518
00:38:34,412 --> 00:38:38,439
We don't care who has made the ruIe

519
00:38:38,616 --> 00:38:45,317
This charm and boIdness has
got me reaI confused

520
00:38:45,456 --> 00:38:48,550
I wouId suggest we keep a competition

521
00:38:48,626 --> 00:38:53,154
Yes, a competition is the best aIternate
when many stand an equaI chance

522
00:38:53,264 --> 00:38:56,165
According to mythoIogy, Raman got
married to Sita by breaking an arrow

523
00:38:56,267 --> 00:38:57,962
I wiII break their bones

524
00:38:58,035 --> 00:39:01,334
So, he who wins the competition,
wiII get married to Damayanti

525
00:39:01,405 --> 00:39:03,100
Let us have an eating competition

526
00:39:03,207 --> 00:39:04,469
That is for you to stand
a chance to win, isn't it?

527
00:39:04,542 --> 00:39:05,372
Get Iost!

528
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:07,500
I can forego anything
to make Damayanti mine

529
00:39:07,611 --> 00:39:08,543
Me too...

530
00:39:08,612 --> 00:39:11,137
I am your big brother
So, go back home, I say

531
00:39:11,215 --> 00:39:12,147
You, get Iost, you dog!

532
00:39:12,283 --> 00:39:14,080
- What did you caII me?
- Don't you dare to touch me!

533
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:15,311
PIease, hoId this

534
00:39:16,387 --> 00:39:19,982
Damayanti, I can give up anything for you

535
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:22,591
Listen

536
00:39:22,827 --> 00:39:24,488
Go there, wiII you?

537
00:39:41,479 --> 00:39:53,186
Misty eyes turn happy with your beauty

538
00:39:53,424 --> 00:40:04,961
Offering comfort to a burning heart

539
00:40:05,269 --> 00:40:17,272
You came like a cool breeze
To a barren land longing relief

540
00:40:17,381 --> 00:40:23,411
Can't finish loving you this lifetime

541
00:40:23,521 --> 00:40:35,558
Misty eyes turn happy with your beauty

542
00:41:05,696 --> 00:41:18,097
Your mischiefs are a relief too
Drawing crossroads in me

543
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:35,749
Among dreams aplenty
You emerged like a shining pot

544
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:47,761
You made me longing for love
Like life in golden town

545
00:41:50,574 --> 00:42:02,315
Misty eyes turn happy with your beauty

546
00:42:32,816 --> 00:42:45,024
Shattering all my thoughts
You came like water droplets galore

547
00:42:50,834 --> 00:43:02,712
My thoughts fill with your nuances
Renewed beside me by the day

548
00:43:02,813 --> 00:43:14,782
l accepted it with all my heart
To be forever

549
00:43:17,695 --> 00:43:29,732
Misty eyes turn happy with your beauty

550
00:43:48,092 --> 00:43:49,423
Who are you actuaIIy?

551
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:51,527
That is a question
I have not found the answerto

552
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:55,463
I do not know
I can't remember anything

553
00:43:55,566 --> 00:43:57,591
Why are you acting in front of us?

554
00:43:58,135 --> 00:43:59,295
I am not acting...

555
00:44:00,237 --> 00:44:02,501
MaaIu, the name that you have
given me, is aII I know

556
00:44:02,873 --> 00:44:05,569
I can't even remember my reaI name

557
00:44:08,345 --> 00:44:09,812
Can I ask you something?

558
00:44:12,549 --> 00:44:14,449
WiII you give me off to those fat men?

559
00:44:15,586 --> 00:44:18,555
I couId have thrown you or given you away
Iong back, if I wanted to

560
00:44:33,404 --> 00:44:35,235
Leave me aIone!

561
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:18,575
MaaIu...

562
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:32,221
Catch hoId of him!

563
00:45:49,613 --> 00:45:52,013
l am letting you go only
because of his recommendation

564
00:45:52,149 --> 00:45:53,480
Otherwise, l would have
taught you a lesson

565
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:54,573
Did you hear that?

566
00:45:55,319 --> 00:45:58,982
It hurts you if we raise our hands
against a poIice-man, isn't it?

567
00:45:59,056 --> 00:46:01,889
If you speak anymore
I'II break your bones

568
00:46:01,959 --> 00:46:04,826
These are common diaIogues
at the poIice-stations back home

569
00:46:04,895 --> 00:46:06,055
Hey, get Iost!

570
00:46:07,231 --> 00:46:08,596
Is she fine?

571
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:12,466
I had gone to the hospitaI

572
00:46:12,569 --> 00:46:13,831
What's next?

573
00:46:14,638 --> 00:46:15,798
She is not there

574
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:17,602
Where has she gone?

575
00:46:17,841 --> 00:46:19,331
Her reIatives have come
and taken her away

576
00:46:19,476 --> 00:46:20,408
Where to?

577
00:46:21,245 --> 00:46:22,109
No cIue about that!

578
00:46:30,187 --> 00:46:32,417
Why did she come into our Iives?

579
00:46:32,523 --> 00:46:39,486
The initiaI fights, Iots of Iove after
that and now, she has gone off somewhere

580
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:41,597
She might not come back

581
00:46:41,832 --> 00:46:43,823
Otherwise, she wouId have come
back by now

582
00:46:44,001 --> 00:46:46,595
No, she wiII not come back ever

583
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:52,966
She can forget aII that has happened
But, how can I?

584
00:46:56,113 --> 00:46:57,444
- Yes, he is here
- Who is it?

585
00:46:57,548 --> 00:46:58,412
Your mother

586
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:01,949
What is it, mother?

587
00:47:05,989 --> 00:47:07,286
I wiII Ieave immediateIy

588
00:47:08,392 --> 00:47:09,256
What is it?

589
00:47:09,626 --> 00:47:12,254
My father is seriousIy iII
I need to go home soon

590
00:47:28,846 --> 00:47:31,440
I have to go back soon

591
00:47:32,249 --> 00:47:37,312
I cannot be here for Iong
I'm feeIing bad to Ieave you here aIone

592
00:47:37,888 --> 00:47:39,549
Do as you wish

593
00:47:39,623 --> 00:47:42,592
You have never stood by your
parents' wishes

594
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:47,594
Your father had high hopes that,
you wiII foIIow his footsteps

595
00:47:48,632 --> 00:47:52,295
Don't you know that I don't beIieve in
aII these magic chants?

596
00:47:52,402 --> 00:47:56,304
No matter what we pIan, it is
onIy god's wish that happens finaIIy

597
00:47:56,506 --> 00:47:59,998
Bungalow of a Haut Monde in Coorg

598
00:48:02,579 --> 00:48:07,881
The canopy for the wedding
ceIebrations, shouId be a reaI grand one

599
00:48:07,985 --> 00:48:14,254
It is not just a wedding
The girI is from this bungaIow

600
00:48:14,358 --> 00:48:16,986
l know, sir

601
00:48:17,094 --> 00:48:19,460
It is not enough if you say
that you have understood

602
00:48:19,529 --> 00:48:20,587
You shouId understand

603
00:48:20,964 --> 00:48:26,596
The reIatives, friends and VIPs are
coming from America, London, Bombay

604
00:48:26,870 --> 00:48:31,068
If there is a fIaw in what you taken up,
you know how these men here wiII react

605
00:48:31,174 --> 00:48:32,573
It wiII be fine, sir

606
00:48:32,643 --> 00:48:34,611
I know that you wiII do a good job

607
00:48:34,845 --> 00:48:39,373
But, I'm saying this for my satisfaction
Around 20 days more for the wedding

608
00:48:39,483 --> 00:48:41,508
Start with the canopy works tomorrow

609
00:48:41,618 --> 00:48:44,587
Did you sprain your Ieg?

610
00:48:44,821 --> 00:48:46,846
Not my Ieg... you sprained yourtongue

611
00:48:47,124 --> 00:48:50,059
Uff, I got scared!
Take this away

612
00:48:50,627 --> 00:48:53,562
Speed up!
WiII it get ready before the wedding?

613
00:48:54,564 --> 00:48:57,590
Don't open those bottIes
I know the count

614
00:48:57,935 --> 00:49:00,597
There was a caII
from the chartered accountant office

615
00:49:00,837 --> 00:49:02,566
Can I teII you something, sir?

616
00:49:02,639 --> 00:49:06,268
The caterer and the person deaIing
with the canopies, were here

617
00:49:06,410 --> 00:49:08,935
Unniadhiri, pIease wait out
I wiII come and meet you there

618
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:12,414
Did you hear what Unniadhiri just toId?

619
00:49:12,649 --> 00:49:14,412
The preparations are gearing up

620
00:49:14,518 --> 00:49:17,783
I cannot marry someone whom
I don't Iike and that is not a mistake

621
00:49:17,854 --> 00:49:18,980
What is it that, Giridhar Iacks?

622
00:49:19,056 --> 00:49:21,320
I did not say that, he Iacks something
I don't want to marry him

623
00:49:21,425 --> 00:49:22,790
Look at the way she's taIking!

624
00:49:22,893 --> 00:49:27,455
Isn't Giri rich, good Iooking
and the both of you grew up together

625
00:49:27,531 --> 00:49:29,123
He is our reIative too

626
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:31,601
What's in your mind?

627
00:49:32,869 --> 00:49:37,135
I'm in Iove with someone, Niranjan
We have decided to Iive together

628
00:49:37,274 --> 00:49:39,071
- What?
- Stop it!...

629
00:49:41,111 --> 00:49:48,608
The women in this bungaIow can make their
own decisions onIy when I'm no more

630
00:49:49,286 --> 00:49:52,585
Jagannath, Iock her up tiII the wedding

631
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:59,387
- Move away
-Ask him to Ieave me aIone

632
00:49:59,529 --> 00:50:01,588
- I won't come
- Come...!

633
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:04,424
Come this way

634
00:50:04,568 --> 00:50:09,301
Leave me, UncIe

635
00:50:11,641 --> 00:50:12,835
Keep waIking

636
00:50:13,643 --> 00:50:16,407
Come here

637
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,607
In the fixed date..

638
00:50:19,116 --> 00:50:24,486
We wiII get you married as per the pIans

639
00:50:24,621 --> 00:50:25,519
That wiII be with my corpse

640
00:50:25,589 --> 00:50:26,886
Go inside

641
00:51:08,632 --> 00:51:11,032
Who is that?

642
00:51:16,573 --> 00:51:22,273
Who is that?

643
00:51:41,965 --> 00:51:42,795
You...

644
00:52:35,552 --> 00:52:37,850
- It's me...
- You...

645
00:53:12,088 --> 00:53:14,420
Open it...
Get the bag

646
00:53:14,491 --> 00:53:17,824
Come in...

647
00:53:19,129 --> 00:53:20,562
This is the house

648
00:53:20,997 --> 00:53:25,434
Come in...
This is Mukundan Unni Bhattathiri

649
00:53:25,502 --> 00:53:26,594
Greetings!

650
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:29,862
It isjust now that I came to know
your father has passed away

651
00:53:29,973 --> 00:53:32,806
He was happy when I toId him that
the son is way better than the father

652
00:53:32,876 --> 00:53:34,343
- Come on, Iet us Ieave now
- Where to?

653
00:53:34,411 --> 00:53:36,379
To the bungaIow in Coorg...

654
00:53:36,446 --> 00:53:39,040
An eviI spirit that your father had
rooted has been freed again

655
00:53:39,115 --> 00:53:41,208
It is showing aII its power now

656
00:53:41,284 --> 00:53:45,050
Since your father is no more,
he wants you to root her

657
00:53:45,121 --> 00:53:45,985
What?

658
00:53:46,256 --> 00:53:47,553
I mean...to ground her back

659
00:53:47,657 --> 00:53:50,626
My father's deeds have
got over with his time

660
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:55,456
Has he given you a guarantee card
for any ''after services'' after that?

661
00:53:55,532 --> 00:53:57,159
Carry on...pIease Ieave

662
00:53:59,502 --> 00:54:02,835
Is he angry because he is not happy
with the advance amount?

663
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:07,337
With divine thoughts,
bring a beteI Ieaf and 50,000...

664
00:54:07,444 --> 00:54:08,240
1 Iakh!

665
00:54:08,345 --> 00:54:10,074
Yes, 1 Iakh and 1 rupee
PIease wait

666
00:54:10,146 --> 00:54:12,979
I wiII set things right

667
00:54:14,417 --> 00:54:15,247
There he is...

668
00:54:16,553 --> 00:54:18,578
You proud one in debt...

669
00:54:18,855 --> 00:54:21,517
Do you know who that man is?

670
00:54:21,625 --> 00:54:24,992
He is the one who suppIies goId
to aII the jeweIIery shops in South India

671
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:26,187
Oh, he's a jeweIer!

672
00:54:26,296 --> 00:54:28,526
Yes, Iet us snatch it from him

673
00:54:28,632 --> 00:54:32,090
It is either our Iuck or their bad Iuck
that, the ghost had to come out now

674
00:54:32,168 --> 00:54:35,228
If we root it back, we can get
the money that we demand

675
00:54:35,305 --> 00:54:37,364
We have paid off the drummers
and others waiting outside...

676
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:39,271
with the advance money
we got from him

677
00:54:39,342 --> 00:54:42,106
Who asked you to do aII this
without my permission?

678
00:54:42,212 --> 00:54:45,147
It is no kids pIay to deaI
with ghosts and spirits

679
00:54:45,215 --> 00:54:47,046
It is done by risking one's Iife

680
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:49,244
I have gone with my father
and seen it as a kid

681
00:54:49,319 --> 00:54:51,549
I, do fear aII this

682
00:54:51,655 --> 00:54:53,179
Who is going to do it?

683
00:54:53,256 --> 00:54:55,486
We wiII just go,
take them on a ride and get back

684
00:54:55,592 --> 00:54:56,616
That is it!

685
00:54:57,494 --> 00:55:01,260
He has agreed!...

686
00:55:02,232 --> 00:55:03,028
Agreed?...

687
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:04,293
Here they come...

688
00:55:04,367 --> 00:55:08,565
He has agreed to come
We forced him to

689
00:55:08,638 --> 00:55:10,230
Here's the offering
Which is east facing?

690
00:55:10,307 --> 00:55:12,832
Let us not fight forthat
Give it to me

691
00:55:13,243 --> 00:55:15,507
Ask her to get ready with her bags

692
00:55:15,612 --> 00:55:17,307
She wiII have to Ieave once
Mukundan Unni reaches there

693
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:19,610
- Whom are you taIking about?
- The ghost!...

694
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:33,460
- Mukundan, open the door
- What is it?

695
00:55:34,297 --> 00:55:35,594
She just heId me

696
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:38,164
Did she?
Let me see her

697
00:55:38,234 --> 00:55:40,259
It's the ghost!

698
00:55:40,470 --> 00:55:44,201
Ii just saw a dream now
EarIy morning dreams do come true

699
00:55:44,374 --> 00:55:49,004
For the past 4 years, he has been dreaming
of getting married to Aishwarya Rai

700
00:55:49,079 --> 00:55:50,603
Did it happen? Abhishek Bachchan
has married her, isn't it

701
00:55:50,847 --> 00:55:53,042
What has gone, is gone
Let us taIk of what we can get right now

702
00:55:53,116 --> 00:55:54,447
Get ready to Ieave now

703
00:55:54,551 --> 00:55:56,280
Be the exorcist

704
00:55:56,386 --> 00:55:59,014
I am not wiIIing to do something
that I do not know of

705
00:55:59,089 --> 00:56:03,526
I have bought these ghost movies
for you to Iearn from

706
00:56:08,832 --> 00:56:09,890
Are aII these ghost movies?

707
00:56:09,999 --> 00:56:11,933
Some porn too, to reIax in between

708
00:56:12,035 --> 00:56:15,198
Whatever you say, I am not wiIIing
to die in an unknown Iand

709
00:56:15,305 --> 00:56:18,035
- Give me that porn
- No way...

710
00:56:18,108 --> 00:56:22,272
Mukundan Unni, your father died being

711
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:23,971
hurt with aII the debts made
because of you

712
00:56:24,047 --> 00:56:25,537
What shouId I do forthat?

713
00:56:26,015 --> 00:56:28,381
Yourfather's spirit wiII be at peace

714
00:56:28,451 --> 00:56:32,581
...onIy if no one comes here
asking for money because of you

715
00:56:33,556 --> 00:56:35,820
These braceIets, made by
yourfore-fathers...

716
00:56:35,959 --> 00:56:39,395
...had kept your father
safe from aII dangers

717
00:56:39,963 --> 00:56:43,228
You wiII be safe as Iong as
you have these with you

718
00:56:48,471 --> 00:56:53,101
Wear this chain
No eviI force can harm you

719
00:56:53,243 --> 00:56:57,873
I was born after 9 years
of hoping for a chiId after your marriage

720
00:56:58,114 --> 00:57:00,082
- Do I have to do this?
- Yes, you have to

721
00:57:00,216 --> 00:57:02,980
Your mother wants you to
You have to go!

722
00:57:03,653 --> 00:57:05,143
Did you hear what mom said?

723
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:08,224
Mothers, normaIIy wish
onIy good fortheir kids

724
00:57:08,324 --> 00:57:11,259
This is the first time
I'm seeing a mother

725
00:57:11,327 --> 00:57:14,057
...intentionaIIy pIunging her son
into troubIe

726
00:57:15,064 --> 00:57:18,591
- ShaII we go?
- Hmmm...

727
00:57:34,884 --> 00:57:35,976
Niranjan, where are you?

728
00:57:36,052 --> 00:57:36,950
I am waiting outside the gate

729
00:57:37,086 --> 00:57:39,020
Wait there, in the car
I wiII be there soon

730
00:57:39,088 --> 00:57:40,020
Okay...

731
00:58:58,167 --> 00:59:01,432
- Who are you?
- It's me...

732
00:59:02,438 --> 00:59:04,599
You are eIoping away with your Iover!

733
00:59:05,108 --> 00:59:07,474
I had attempted this once

734
00:59:07,577 --> 00:59:10,546
But, the men foIks of this house,
did not aIIow me to

735
00:59:10,647 --> 00:59:12,080
What are you taIking about?

736
00:59:12,148 --> 00:59:15,811
You have no cIue, isn't it?
Then you need not know about it

737
00:59:16,452 --> 00:59:20,320
But, no one shouId get
anything that I couIdn't

738
00:59:20,557 --> 00:59:21,922
That appIies to you too

739
00:59:43,146 --> 00:59:44,943
- Why are you so Iate?
- Nothing at aII

740
00:59:45,014 --> 00:59:45,844
Come on...

741
01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:10,296
The tyre has to be changed

742
01:00:10,907 --> 01:00:13,068
No, not necessary
Just escape soon

743
01:00:16,946 --> 01:00:18,436
Where are you off to?

744
01:00:18,514 --> 01:00:20,072
I'm asking you to just come with me

745
01:00:20,149 --> 01:00:22,447
- What are you doing?
- Come on...

746
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:24,814
Let me go

747
01:00:29,292 --> 01:00:31,624
- Come on...
- Let's go away from here

748
01:00:31,861 --> 01:00:32,828
Come with me!

749
01:00:57,086 --> 01:00:59,919
- Have you got any information?
- No, nothing at aII

750
01:01:00,223 --> 01:01:02,191
They have gone
I wiII Iet you know

751
01:01:02,959 --> 01:01:05,587
- What happened?
- We have searched everywhere

752
01:01:05,662 --> 01:01:06,219
No information at aII?

753
01:01:06,295 --> 01:01:09,059
We have checked with the hospitaIs,
raiIway station and bus stand

754
01:01:09,132 --> 01:01:11,327
- But, no information at aII
- Let us compIain to the poIice

755
01:01:11,467 --> 01:01:15,198
- Can you come here?
- What is it?

756
01:01:16,105 --> 01:01:17,470
I know that I wiII not be forgiven

757
01:01:17,607 --> 01:01:21,475
But, I need to go with Niranjan,
the man I Ioved...

758
01:01:21,544 --> 01:01:22,442
Do not search for me

759
01:01:22,545 --> 01:01:24,410
She has betrayed us!...

760
01:01:25,048 --> 01:01:27,881
What do we teII
Rajendran and Subhadra?

761
01:01:28,184 --> 01:01:30,084
They are busy with
the wedding preparations

762
01:01:30,186 --> 01:01:32,814
I do not know

763
01:01:33,356 --> 01:01:36,018
Why do you worry so much?

764
01:01:36,159 --> 01:01:40,596
You have another daughter, Chandana,
who is aIso oId enough to get married

765
01:01:40,663 --> 01:01:43,291
We need to find out if she is
wiIIing to get married

766
01:01:43,366 --> 01:01:46,631
We do not know what she thinks

767
01:01:46,936 --> 01:01:48,631
They are right

768
01:01:48,905 --> 01:01:51,635
CaII Chandana and ask her
to come here tomorrow

769
01:02:27,176 --> 01:02:29,144
- I scared you...
- You dog!

770
01:02:29,946 --> 01:02:32,437
Take this bag

771
01:02:34,517 --> 01:02:36,917
- Yes, how much is it?
- 200 and something

772
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:38,412
What is that, 'something'?

773
01:02:38,488 --> 01:02:41,048
Give him the 200 for now
We wiII give him the 'something' Iater on

774
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:45,622
Nothing, swamiji

775
01:02:45,928 --> 01:02:48,624
l just wanted to see your face
That's why l called you again

776
01:02:48,865 --> 01:02:49,627
What does that mean?

777
01:02:49,866 --> 01:02:53,927
I wanted to see your face
for the Iast time

778
01:02:58,241 --> 01:03:01,540
I am going back
He meant to say that I wiII die

779
01:03:01,611 --> 01:03:04,409
He couId aIso mean that,
he wiII die soon

780
01:03:04,580 --> 01:03:07,947
Come on...

781
01:03:12,655 --> 01:03:14,350
- That was the gate...
- Get Iost!

782
01:03:14,891 --> 01:03:18,156
This is an oId bungaIow
Can there be a ghost over here?

783
01:03:18,227 --> 01:03:21,162
WiII the ghost Iook for a fIat
at the marine drive and go stay there?

784
01:03:21,264 --> 01:03:23,164
- She wiII sureIy be here
- See you back home

785
01:03:23,232 --> 01:03:24,563
Wait there!

786
01:03:24,634 --> 01:03:26,431
PIease stop scaring him unnecessariIy

787
01:03:26,502 --> 01:03:27,161
There is no ghost here

788
01:03:27,236 --> 01:03:31,195
In case it is there, it is something god
has shown us after seeing our sufferings

789
01:03:31,307 --> 01:03:34,606
We wiII enjoy here

790
01:03:41,851 --> 01:03:44,285
That buII is heading towards us

791
01:03:44,420 --> 01:03:45,352
Keep running...

792
01:03:45,421 --> 01:03:47,218
- Escape...
- Don't Ieave me aIone

793
01:03:47,323 --> 01:03:50,918
Did you get a Ioan from the buII?
I beIieve it is coming to kiII us

794
01:03:51,027 --> 01:03:52,016
Keep running...

795
01:03:52,962 --> 01:03:56,625
The buII can even tear out our underwears

796
01:03:57,200 --> 01:04:02,467
- Escape
- Do not Ieave me aIone

797
01:04:03,639 --> 01:04:09,874
Why does the buII hate the coIor, 'red'?
I guess, it beIong to the congress party

798
01:04:10,046 --> 01:04:11,445
Oh my mom!

799
01:04:11,647 --> 01:04:13,842
Ayaioooh...!

800
01:04:19,121 --> 01:04:21,180
They are coming
Get up

801
01:04:21,324 --> 01:04:22,985
They are coming
Don't spoiI it

802
01:04:23,092 --> 01:04:24,582
The buII stung me on my ass

803
01:04:24,660 --> 01:04:25,627
They have reached

804
01:04:25,962 --> 01:04:27,862
Start the chants

805
01:04:40,276 --> 01:04:42,972
- Greetings to you aII
- Get up...

806
01:04:47,149 --> 01:04:48,810
The Iand rituaIs are over

807
01:04:48,985 --> 01:04:52,318
Oh god, pIease take care of this bungaIow

808
01:04:52,388 --> 01:04:55,084
The soiI over here, smeIIs of bIood

809
01:04:55,191 --> 01:04:59,093
As soon as I entered, I heard the cries
of the wandering spirits

810
01:04:59,195 --> 01:05:00,287
We, heard it too

811
01:05:00,396 --> 01:05:03,490
- PIease come in
- We too!

812
01:05:03,599 --> 01:05:04,566
PIease

813
01:05:04,667 --> 01:05:09,604
I have heard when my father
taIking about this bungaIow

814
01:05:09,672 --> 01:05:11,867
We are aII frightened

815
01:05:11,941 --> 01:05:14,569
It's unnecessary
I have come now, isn't it!...

816
01:05:14,677 --> 01:05:20,206
This is my uncIe, my wife...MaIini
Subhadra, Sangeetha and Sumithra

817
01:05:20,283 --> 01:05:21,910
Lot of women around

818
01:05:21,984 --> 01:05:24,214
Looks Iike they wiII have
a crime story to write about me

819
01:05:24,287 --> 01:05:28,519
Teach them some chants
when you are free of work

820
01:05:28,591 --> 01:05:30,559
Betterthan that is..

821
01:05:30,626 --> 01:05:31,456
What did you just say?

822
01:05:31,527 --> 01:05:33,051
That's the name of my grandmother's oiI

823
01:05:33,162 --> 01:05:35,062
What is it?
Can't you do it?

824
01:05:35,164 --> 01:05:36,358
Yes, we can

825
01:05:36,432 --> 01:05:39,230
Unniathiri, pIease show them to their rooms

826
01:05:39,302 --> 01:05:40,291
Come with me

827
01:05:49,011 --> 01:05:50,979
Can you smeII something burnt?

828
01:05:52,081 --> 01:05:57,178
This is where Manavendar was burnt to death

829
01:05:57,320 --> 01:05:58,617
- By whom?
- By Ruku

830
01:05:58,854 --> 01:05:59,821
What was it for?

831
01:05:59,889 --> 01:06:03,950
There is a Iong road
Ieading towards the north

832
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:10,260
That was where Gangadhar
was bitten on the neck and kiIIed

833
01:06:10,333 --> 01:06:12,096
- By whom?...
- By Ruku...

834
01:06:12,168 --> 01:06:15,569
Why wasn't the poIice informed
of aII these murders?

835
01:06:15,671 --> 01:06:19,038
- What can the poIice do to the ghost?
- Ghost?!...

836
01:06:19,108 --> 01:06:20,405
Yes, that's Ruku...

837
01:06:20,977 --> 01:06:23,138
Wait there!
ShouId we proceed further?

838
01:06:23,212 --> 01:06:25,009
Yes, we have to
Keep waIking

839
01:06:25,982 --> 01:06:27,609
- Come on...
- We are...

840
01:06:27,683 --> 01:06:33,417
A sorcerer, MuthuveIan, from
TamiI Nadu had rooted her once

841
01:06:33,489 --> 01:06:35,116
- Rooted whom?
- Ruku...

842
01:06:35,257 --> 01:06:36,918
Guess what we saw
the next morning after that...

843
01:06:36,993 --> 01:06:37,823
What was it?

844
01:06:37,893 --> 01:06:42,956
MuthuveIan was torn to pieces
and thrown around the courtyard

845
01:06:43,065 --> 01:06:46,159
- What is it?
- Now, you are here...

846
01:06:47,570 --> 01:06:51,301
That outhouse, where
the buriaI ground is for you

847
01:06:51,407 --> 01:06:52,135
What?

848
01:06:52,241 --> 01:06:53,902
I meant your stay!...

849
01:06:55,244 --> 01:06:59,544
I did not reaIize it's so Iate
I need to get back before she comes out

850
01:07:00,583 --> 01:07:01,572
Come here...

851
01:07:01,684 --> 01:07:05,814
- What is it?
- There is something with this tree

852
01:07:05,888 --> 01:07:07,879
TeII us whatever, it may be...

853
01:07:07,990 --> 01:07:09,855
- Do you know what tree it is?
- Coconut?

854
01:07:09,925 --> 01:07:13,417
- No, do you know what is on it?
- OwI?

855
01:07:13,496 --> 01:07:16,363
The ghost dweIIs on top of it

856
01:07:22,638 --> 01:07:27,974
The peopIe here, have faIIen
for our Iooks and taIks

857
01:07:28,077 --> 01:07:28,634
Yes, that's true

858
01:07:28,878 --> 01:07:30,505
We wiII have to take money from them

859
01:07:30,579 --> 01:07:32,945
By taIking about the rituaIs that,
we know wiII never happen

860
01:07:33,015 --> 01:07:34,505
That, depends pureIy
on your performance

861
01:07:34,617 --> 01:07:37,415
The first day itseIf, has been a fiasco

862
01:07:38,187 --> 01:07:41,384
- Don't finish off our food too
- Is it over?

863
01:07:41,490 --> 01:07:44,516
I cannot adjust to the food
outside KeraIa

864
01:07:44,593 --> 01:07:46,857
I am worried if the cIimate wiII suit me

865
01:07:46,929 --> 01:07:48,624
I am worried if we wiII get possessed

866
01:07:48,864 --> 01:07:51,628
Where is the pickIe that,
my mom had given us?

867
01:07:52,068 --> 01:07:55,367
Her water-appIe pickIes can
entice you to eat a kiIo of rice

868
01:07:55,471 --> 01:07:57,632
Why eat a kiIo?
You need to eatjust right

869
01:07:57,873 --> 01:08:00,535
- Here is the pickIe
- Give me some

870
01:08:02,445 --> 01:08:03,844
Tastes Iike soiI

871
01:08:03,913 --> 01:08:07,110
Let me taste that
Yes, you are right

872
01:08:09,351 --> 01:08:10,511
Who brought this here?

873
01:08:10,619 --> 01:08:16,057
I took it from that cemetery and
carried it for the spooky effect

874
01:08:17,593 --> 01:08:20,426
- What is it?
- It resembIes someone we know, isn't it?

875
01:08:20,563 --> 01:08:22,554
- Show me
- Okay

876
01:08:22,665 --> 01:08:25,395
This Iooks Iike Raman Chettiar,
who had died heart-broken

877
01:08:25,468 --> 01:08:27,368
...because you did not pay back the debts

878
01:08:27,436 --> 01:08:28,095
Is it?

879
01:08:28,204 --> 01:08:30,195
Give back the money, you idiot!

880
01:08:34,677 --> 01:08:38,545
This dog has been crying ever since
we have reached this pIace

881
01:08:38,614 --> 01:08:39,478
What is it?

882
01:08:39,582 --> 01:08:43,951
The beIief is that, dogs can see
the spirits that humans cannot see

883
01:08:44,053 --> 01:08:45,077
Why do you fear?

884
01:08:45,221 --> 01:08:48,122
The ghost wiII not harm us tiII we try
to do something to root it

885
01:08:48,224 --> 01:08:50,988
- We wiII not be doing that!
- Yes, you are right

886
01:09:00,269 --> 01:09:01,531
Where is this noise from?

887
01:09:03,672 --> 01:09:05,435
What is that overthere?

888
01:09:14,550 --> 01:09:17,849
Mukundan Unni, do not fear, be boId

889
01:09:17,953 --> 01:09:21,514
My friend is an inspector

890
01:09:27,496 --> 01:09:29,396
What is it?
What happened?

891
01:09:29,899 --> 01:09:31,389
This is terribIe

892
01:09:32,301 --> 01:09:33,495
What was the noise?

893
01:09:33,636 --> 01:09:39,040
Why did you scare away the maid
who came to cIear the dishes?

894
01:09:39,175 --> 01:09:40,199
She got reaIIy scared!

895
01:09:40,309 --> 01:09:41,435
Come forward

896
01:09:41,577 --> 01:09:44,011
Did she come here?
We did not reaIize that

897
01:09:44,113 --> 01:09:45,341
We were busy with the chants

898
01:09:45,447 --> 01:09:53,286
Some chants have to be toId aIoud
and some onIy in the mind

899
01:09:53,389 --> 01:09:55,619
Is that why they are asIeep Iike this?
Wake up...

900
01:09:55,691 --> 01:09:58,421
They are tired after the journey
Fast asIeep...

901
01:09:58,527 --> 01:10:01,087
They have to start the chants earIy
in the morning tomorrow

902
01:10:01,163 --> 01:10:03,631
My trademark rituaIs with
the traditionaI fIoor patterns

903
01:10:03,866 --> 01:10:07,461
...using rice powder, cinnamon sticks
and the horns of a bIack deer,

904
01:10:07,536 --> 01:10:10,562
...wiII aII start off earIy,
tomorrow morning

905
01:10:10,673 --> 01:10:14,575
- So, you can carry on...
- Let's go

906
01:10:16,612 --> 01:10:20,912
Which famiIy does this dark skinned
priest beIong to?

907
01:10:21,417 --> 01:10:25,012
He is from Travancore, from some famiIy
that's not there at aII

908
01:10:32,194 --> 01:10:33,627
Here's yourtea

909
01:10:33,862 --> 01:10:36,023
He was reaIIy upset,
as if he were unconscious,

910
01:10:36,165 --> 01:10:39,100
when we heard of Devangini,
having eIoped away

911
01:10:39,235 --> 01:10:41,226
Yes, I feIt paraIysed

912
01:10:44,673 --> 01:10:48,074
Right now, I feeI I did not have
a daughter Iike that

913
01:10:48,177 --> 01:10:50,145
Did you taIk to Giri about it?

914
01:10:50,679 --> 01:10:54,979
He has absoIuteIy no objections and
has Ieft everything to his parents to decide

915
01:10:55,217 --> 01:10:56,878
Did you taIk to Chandana?

916
01:10:56,952 --> 01:11:00,444
Yes, we did mention to her about it
She has totaIIy agreed to it too

917
01:11:00,656 --> 01:11:04,456
She feeIs she is Iucky to be
getting married to Giri

918
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:06,118
AII god's bIessings!

919
01:11:09,665 --> 01:11:14,034
So, Iet us proceed with the wedding
as it has been pIanned

920
01:11:39,361 --> 01:11:42,194
Swamiji (priest)

921
01:11:53,108 --> 01:11:54,200
Who are you?

922
01:11:55,678 --> 01:11:59,637
Why are you here at midnight?

923
01:11:59,915 --> 01:12:01,348
It is earIy morning aIready

924
01:12:01,583 --> 01:12:04,074
Ranganathan got scared
seeing something

925
01:12:04,186 --> 01:12:06,518
I was asked to come,
get you for heIp

926
01:12:08,691 --> 01:12:10,886
I have not seen you here before

927
01:12:11,026 --> 01:12:15,827
I am Rukmani, Madhavan Unni's daughter
I came here yesterday, with my father

928
01:12:16,265 --> 01:12:19,894
- PIease, do not deIay
- Yes...

929
01:12:20,969 --> 01:12:26,134
Someone in the bungaIow has got scared,
seeing something

930
01:12:26,542 --> 01:12:27,907
I am not coming

931
01:12:29,611 --> 01:12:31,044
Me too...

932
01:12:55,604 --> 01:12:56,866
Has she gone away?

933
01:13:06,982 --> 01:13:08,381
Are you there?

934
01:13:35,677 --> 01:13:37,235
Is there anyone around?

935
01:13:39,681 --> 01:13:44,015
Her name...
Rukmani...

936
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:05,660
Wake up...

937
01:15:06,902 --> 01:15:08,335
We have to Ieave immediateIy

938
01:15:08,437 --> 01:15:10,337
Why are you waking us up in the middIe
of the night and saying we have to Ieave?

939
01:15:10,439 --> 01:15:11,406
Why are you saying this now?

940
01:15:11,473 --> 01:15:14,636
Come on, we have to...
Our Iives are at risk

941
01:15:14,877 --> 01:15:15,639
Come on, Iet's Ieave!...

942
01:15:15,878 --> 01:15:17,345
He must have dreamt of something
Let's sIeep

943
01:15:17,446 --> 01:15:18,140
He's gone mad

944
01:15:18,213 --> 01:15:20,204
It is not dream
Come on...

945
01:15:20,282 --> 01:15:22,512
You have been saying this
right from the day after we came here

946
01:15:22,584 --> 01:15:23,983
TeII us where can we go to!

947
01:15:24,119 --> 01:15:26,383
We can decide that Iater
Be quick now

948
01:15:26,455 --> 01:15:29,982
You Ieave everything haIf way
and choose to be in a fix aIways

949
01:15:30,058 --> 01:15:33,152
In between of aII our probIems,
god, himseIf, has shown us this house

950
01:15:33,262 --> 01:15:34,593
and we are not Ieaving this pIace

951
01:15:34,696 --> 01:15:37,028
We can soIve that
once we Ieave this pIace

952
01:15:37,132 --> 01:15:38,656
How wiII we soIve it?

953
01:15:38,934 --> 01:15:42,597
We can't even go back to the pIaces
we have been with you before

954
01:15:42,671 --> 01:15:44,195
You worked on 8 to 10 acres of Iand

955
01:15:44,273 --> 01:15:46,366
and onIy ended up with debts
amounting to 30 Iakhs

956
01:15:46,475 --> 01:15:48,238
What can we earn
after Ieaving from here?

957
01:15:48,343 --> 01:15:52,279
- I am asking you to just come with me
- We are not coming with you!...

958
01:15:54,383 --> 01:15:57,352
It is my responsibiIity
to take care of both of you

959
01:15:57,486 --> 01:16:00,978
Enough of the trust
and responsibiIities

960
01:16:01,223 --> 01:16:02,850
Let us end it aII, right here

961
01:16:02,958 --> 01:16:05,586
PIease, Iisten to me...

962
01:16:05,694 --> 01:16:09,255
Once we get out of this pIace,
we can decide whetherto end it aII or not

963
01:16:09,364 --> 01:16:14,666
I am teIIing you this for your own good
PIease, trust me...

964
01:17:05,621 --> 01:17:07,486
- Isn't that, MaIu?
- Yes...

965
01:17:09,091 --> 01:17:10,319
Why is she here?

966
01:17:12,127 --> 01:17:13,059
Go on

967
01:17:19,901 --> 01:17:22,495
- Was the journey comfortabIe?
- Yes, it was

968
01:17:22,571 --> 01:17:24,368
Give me Chandana's bag

969
01:18:02,210 --> 01:18:03,404
Give me a hand

970
01:18:05,247 --> 01:18:06,646
Be carefuI

971
01:18:07,082 --> 01:18:09,846
- Why didn't you caII me in the night?
- Diya, who is it?

972
01:18:09,951 --> 01:18:13,216
That's her boy-friend,
John Kurakaran, isn't it?

973
01:18:13,355 --> 01:18:15,448
Let us take the phone away from her
Come on

974
01:18:17,659 --> 01:18:19,650
Chandana, do not come this side

975
01:18:21,496 --> 01:18:24,397
AIIow me to taIk
PIease, do not disturb me

976
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,969
AIong with the pot and camphor that,
we have brought,

977
01:18:28,070 --> 01:18:29,867
- we shouId have carried a binocuIar too
- What is that for?.

978
01:18:30,005 --> 01:18:31,029
For a cIearer view of them

979
01:18:31,139 --> 01:18:32,367
- Do you have any other intentions?
- No...

980
01:18:32,441 --> 01:18:34,068
You can Iook at the 4 other girIs

981
01:18:34,176 --> 01:18:36,167
I wiII poke your eyes for you,
if you Iook at my MaIu

982
01:18:36,244 --> 01:18:38,212
First and foremost, confirm
whether it is your MaIu or not

983
01:18:38,280 --> 01:18:39,406
I wiII confirm it

984
01:18:39,481 --> 01:18:40,607
PIease, waIk forward now

985
01:18:41,316 --> 01:18:42,544
Hey, stop there

986
01:18:42,651 --> 01:18:46,485
John, why don't you take me
to BangaIore with you?

987
01:18:46,555 --> 01:18:48,887
She is waiting impatientIy over here

988
01:18:51,093 --> 01:18:52,025
What is wrong with you?

989
01:18:52,127 --> 01:18:54,152
You have started this, right from the time
I got here yesterday

990
01:18:54,229 --> 01:18:56,993
I am not MaIu
I am Chandana

991
01:18:57,099 --> 01:18:59,863
Don't come, taIking to me
about this hereafter

992
01:19:01,503 --> 01:19:03,528
Looks Iike everything is aIright now

993
01:19:04,005 --> 01:19:05,472
- What did she teII you?
- Nothing...

994
01:19:05,707 --> 01:19:07,937
Same story again
She is not MaIu!

995
01:19:08,176 --> 01:19:10,110
You shouId not appear
in front of her again

996
01:19:10,212 --> 01:19:13,477
- I wiII prove that it is MaIu
- How wiII you prove it?

997
01:19:13,548 --> 01:19:14,913
- Do you remember...
- What?

998
01:19:15,016 --> 01:19:16,381
In the farmhouse, that day,
do you remember

999
01:19:16,485 --> 01:19:19,113
she had danced standing on top of my jeep,
wearing my t-shirt and dhothi?

1000
01:19:19,187 --> 01:19:19,812
Yes, we do...

1001
01:19:19,921 --> 01:19:23,413
That day, I had seen
a bIack moIe on her right thigh

1002
01:19:23,492 --> 01:19:27,019
If I am a man,
I wiII prove that bIack moIe

1003
01:19:27,195 --> 01:19:30,028
Yes, the bIack moIe...
That sounds Iike a good proof

1004
01:19:33,902 --> 01:19:36,894
You...
Don't you know me?

1005
01:19:37,038 --> 01:19:41,475
Don't you remember the days you stayed
with us, fought with us and we were in Iove?

1006
01:19:42,077 --> 01:19:43,339
Get out!...

1007
01:19:43,445 --> 01:19:45,640
Don't taIk nonsense
You are mad

1008
01:19:45,881 --> 01:19:49,874
I wiII prove who is mad
I know that you act weII

1009
01:19:49,985 --> 01:19:51,646
But, you can't pIay the fooI
with me, anymore

1010
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:54,252
Get out, right now
Or eIse, I wiII caII for peopIe

1011
01:19:54,322 --> 01:19:56,552
- Yes, caI...
- Father...

1012
01:20:03,064 --> 01:20:05,999
- What is happening here?
- Unniadri, he is...

1013
01:20:06,134 --> 01:20:09,399
Don't get frightened hearing what
I am going to teII you now

1014
01:20:09,504 --> 01:20:13,964
- Ruku's ghost has possessed her...
- Oh no!...

1015
01:20:14,509 --> 01:20:18,411
- She wiII destroy this house
- You...

1016
01:20:19,447 --> 01:20:21,540
Everybody in the house
shouId be warned that

1017
01:20:21,683 --> 01:20:25,642
...tiII the rituaIs get over,
interactions with her shouId be very minimaI

1018
01:20:25,887 --> 01:20:27,616
- I wiII...
- Escape!

1019
01:20:30,892 --> 01:20:32,450
I wiII treat you

1020
01:20:32,594 --> 01:20:37,156
I wiII not Ieave tiII I root the ghost,
Chandana who has possessed my MaIu

1021
01:20:37,265 --> 01:20:39,165
-Are you there?
- Yes, I am just coming

1022
01:20:43,672 --> 01:20:45,003
What did you tell her?

1023
01:20:45,140 --> 01:20:47,973
I stopped her from taIking
I did not touch her

1024
01:20:48,076 --> 01:20:49,543
I mean to ask,
what did you teII her?

1025
01:20:49,611 --> 01:20:53,047
We, sorcerers have a way
to taIk to these ghosts

1026
01:20:53,215 --> 01:20:54,842
You wiII not understand that Ianguage

1027
01:20:54,916 --> 01:21:00,650
The ghost that was outside the house,
is now dweIIing in Chandana's body

1028
01:21:00,922 --> 01:21:03,618
The peopIe in the bungaIow
have to be warned that,

1029
01:21:03,692 --> 01:21:07,184
I might need to enter her room
at midnights for the rituaI purposes

1030
01:21:07,262 --> 01:21:10,129
- They shouId not misunderstand me
- Okay, you can...

1031
01:21:10,232 --> 01:21:14,601
Hereafter, you have to stop waIking
outside her room, caIIing out for her

1032
01:21:15,503 --> 01:21:16,868
She wiII drink your off...

1033
01:21:16,938 --> 01:21:19,566
There are fat masters in the bungaIow

1034
01:21:19,708 --> 01:21:22,074
How can my 50 miIIiIiters of bIood,
suffice for the ghost?

1035
01:21:22,143 --> 01:21:23,610
Did you not know
that the ghost is on a diet?

1036
01:21:23,678 --> 01:21:25,942
She is not on the Iookout
for the fat masters

1037
01:21:26,014 --> 01:21:28,642
She Iikes a Iean one Iike you

1038
01:21:30,218 --> 01:21:31,412
- Unniadri...
- Yes

1039
01:21:31,519 --> 01:21:33,953
Can you get me
something hot to drink?

1040
01:21:45,267 --> 01:21:47,565
Take it off

1041
01:21:49,004 --> 01:21:52,303
Once we see the moIe on the thigh,
we can proceed further

1042
01:21:52,374 --> 01:21:55,070
- What?
- I mean, proceed further with the proof

1043
01:21:55,343 --> 01:21:56,537
Got scared?

1044
01:22:03,585 --> 01:22:06,145
- Look at her sIeeping...
- Yes, I saw it...

1045
01:22:06,554 --> 01:22:08,454
Sit down

1046
01:22:08,556 --> 01:22:11,548
I'II see it and keep updating you
Keep quiet...

1047
01:22:12,594 --> 01:22:14,858
- What's happening?
- Nothing at aII

1048
01:22:14,996 --> 01:22:16,156
Did you see the moIe?

1049
01:22:16,298 --> 01:22:17,993
I am Iooking for it

1050
01:22:18,066 --> 01:22:21,035
You can sit now
Let us check it out

1051
01:22:21,136 --> 01:22:22,262
That's not necessary

1052
01:22:33,515 --> 01:22:35,107
Did you see the moIe?

1053
01:22:36,017 --> 01:22:38,417
She is wearing a pair
of shorts underneath

1054
01:22:39,688 --> 01:22:43,647
It is our curse
You wanted to see it aII yourseIf

1055
01:22:43,925 --> 01:22:47,053
- You deserve this
- What wiII you do now?

1056
01:22:47,128 --> 01:22:48,459
I have another idea

1057
01:22:48,596 --> 01:22:53,260
Did the sorcerer confirm that Chandana
has been possessed by Ruku's ghost?

1058
01:22:53,335 --> 01:22:54,461
Why shouId he confirm it?

1059
01:22:54,569 --> 01:22:57,629
I heard her shouting out Ioud when he
Iocked up the room to start the rituaIs

1060
01:22:57,706 --> 01:22:58,638
Oh, is it?

1061
01:22:58,707 --> 01:23:01,369
Are you scared to sIeep here because
your room is right next to hers'?

1062
01:23:01,476 --> 01:23:02,670
- No...
- That's good

1063
01:23:02,911 --> 01:23:05,641
If you are scared, can you
come with me tiII there?

1064
01:23:06,081 --> 01:23:07,241
I am not scared

1065
01:23:07,349 --> 01:23:09,010
You are... I know that

1066
01:23:09,084 --> 01:23:10,312
- Is it?
- Come on

1067
01:23:10,385 --> 01:23:12,649
I am not scared

1068
01:23:22,197 --> 01:23:27,567
I mean to teII you the truth
A truth, that is true to my knowIedge

1069
01:23:27,702 --> 01:23:32,332
Ruku's ghost has cast her eyes
on these 5 girIs

1070
01:23:32,440 --> 01:23:36,001
CIothed, un-cIothed rituaIs is
the onIy aIternative, I know of

1071
01:23:36,077 --> 01:23:36,873
What does that mean?

1072
01:23:36,945 --> 01:23:38,913
Haven't you read
the mythoIogicaI treatises?

1073
01:23:39,014 --> 01:23:40,504
- No, I haven't
- No point in reading it too

1074
01:23:40,615 --> 01:23:43,516
This is not mentioned in it
Bhattathiri, carry on...

1075
01:23:44,085 --> 01:23:48,044
You shouId wake up before dawn,
wearing a bust-cIoth,

1076
01:23:48,189 --> 01:23:51,647
dip thrice in the Iake and come,
sit in front of the fire for the rituaIs

1077
01:23:52,927 --> 01:23:55,589
- I am not forthis
- I cannot do this vuIgar act

1078
01:23:55,697 --> 01:23:57,221
It sounds so cheap

1079
01:23:57,332 --> 01:23:58,959
Sounds so boring...

1080
01:24:00,702 --> 01:24:01,930
ShouId I Ieave or stay back?

1081
01:24:02,037 --> 01:24:03,129
You can go aIone

1082
01:24:03,204 --> 01:24:04,296
We are not coming
tiII the rituaIs are done

1083
01:24:04,372 --> 01:24:05,236
I am not coming too

1084
01:24:05,340 --> 01:24:07,672
Can you make the girIs understand?

1085
01:24:07,942 --> 01:24:13,972
You have not been brought up here
You may not have beIief in aII this

1086
01:24:14,082 --> 01:24:17,381
You have to Iisten to him
It wiII do you good

1087
01:24:17,452 --> 01:24:18,885
Forget it, if they are not interested

1088
01:24:18,953 --> 01:24:21,649
But, it is you, who wiII have to suffer
the future repercussions of this

1089
01:24:21,923 --> 01:24:22,548
Come on, Iet us go

1090
01:24:22,657 --> 01:24:25,285
He is asking us to wait
Don't be adamant to Ieave

1091
01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:27,419
Don't say no to the rituaIs

1092
01:24:27,529 --> 01:24:28,860
PIease forgive us

1093
01:24:28,930 --> 01:24:29,487
For what?

1094
01:24:29,631 --> 01:24:31,792
They are not used to aII this

1095
01:24:31,900 --> 01:24:32,730
You mean, taking bath?

1096
01:24:32,901 --> 01:24:35,165
Taking a bath in the Iake!...
Wearing a bust-cIoth...

1097
01:24:35,370 --> 01:24:37,395
This is how you get
used to some things

1098
01:24:37,472 --> 01:24:40,635
Ruku can't be avoided Iike this
She has targeted them too

1099
01:24:41,509 --> 01:24:43,568
- I saw it Iast night
- What?

1100
01:24:43,645 --> 01:24:47,081
I saw a huge figure
in front of Chandana's room

1101
01:24:47,182 --> 01:24:50,276
- Oh, is it?...
- Yes, so you shouId agree to this!...

1102
01:24:50,385 --> 01:24:52,080
We are not for this fancy dress

1103
01:24:53,321 --> 01:24:55,585
I agree to this
They wiII be there too

1104
01:24:55,690 --> 01:25:00,889
You cannot say this for a revenge
You shouId be there!...

1105
01:25:00,962 --> 01:25:01,986
See you there...

1106
01:25:04,466 --> 01:25:06,866
The pot is ready
The oiI...

1107
01:25:07,102 --> 01:25:08,160
Don't pour that

1108
01:25:08,236 --> 01:25:09,225
- That's not the oiI
- What?

1109
01:25:09,337 --> 01:25:12,363
I have mixed a drink for us
to have afterthe rituaIs are over

1110
01:25:12,440 --> 01:25:12,963
Keep it there

1111
01:25:13,041 --> 01:25:17,137
We shouId have it with a pIantain
It tastes superb

1112
01:25:17,278 --> 01:25:20,111
- What did you say?
- Nothing

1113
01:25:22,350 --> 01:25:24,045
Hey, Iook there!...

1114
01:25:30,291 --> 01:25:31,883
My god...

1115
01:25:32,360 --> 01:25:33,486
Is it a piIgrimage?

1116
01:25:33,628 --> 01:25:36,324
I had mentioned that,
it is onIy forthe girIs

1117
01:25:36,397 --> 01:25:38,490
Why is the whoIe bungaIow coming here?

1118
01:25:40,902 --> 01:25:43,336
I cannot Iook for
that oId man's moIe

1119
01:25:43,438 --> 01:25:47,067
OnIy Iadies!
Go and bIock the others

1120
01:25:49,043 --> 01:25:49,941
Stop there

1121
01:25:50,011 --> 01:25:51,603
Where are you aII off to?

1122
01:25:51,713 --> 01:25:57,674
It is onIy the virgin girIs,
who are aIIowed to appear for this rituaI

1123
01:25:57,952 --> 01:26:00,921
Is that room
a compartment onIy for Iadies?

1124
01:26:01,022 --> 01:26:03,047
Are women aIIowed
to go to the 'SabarimaIa'?

1125
01:26:03,124 --> 01:26:05,558
Some practices are onIy for Iadies

1126
01:26:05,894 --> 01:26:07,191
You cannot say that

1127
01:26:07,295 --> 01:26:09,092
Unniadri, keep quiet, wiII you?

1128
01:26:09,531 --> 01:26:12,432
Waking up earIy, taking bath
and getting ready, was aII a waste of time

1129
01:26:12,500 --> 01:26:14,968
It is good to take a shower

1130
01:26:16,137 --> 01:26:19,038
Who gave you the right
to use my 'understand'?

1131
01:26:19,140 --> 01:26:21,472
Do not repeat this?

1132
01:26:22,610 --> 01:26:24,168
- My grandfather...
- Grandfather?...

1133
01:26:24,279 --> 01:26:26,645
UncIe, it is aIright
to have taken a shower

1134
01:26:26,714 --> 01:26:29,979
You can keep chanting this

1135
01:26:34,422 --> 01:26:39,018
PIease, keep chanting it

1136
01:26:39,093 --> 01:26:41,288
- How can you say this?
- Is everything ready?

1137
01:26:41,362 --> 01:26:42,454
Yes, it is...

1138
01:26:42,564 --> 01:26:44,862
You chanted aII your
teachers names, isn't it?

1139
01:26:44,933 --> 01:26:46,093
Keep quiet!
Come on

1140
01:26:46,201 --> 01:26:48,101
Keep waIking

1141
01:26:48,236 --> 01:26:50,101
- Wait there
- What for?

1142
01:26:50,238 --> 01:26:53,674
If aII of them waIk in together,
how wiII I...See?

1143
01:26:54,175 --> 01:26:58,976
Once the fire is Iit,
you can come in one by one

1144
01:26:59,480 --> 01:27:01,072
You wiII faII sick
if you stand here Iike this

1145
01:27:01,149 --> 01:27:02,241
Medicines can cure that

1146
01:27:02,317 --> 01:27:05,343
But, no medicines can cure it
if your name is spoiIt because of him

1147
01:27:05,420 --> 01:27:08,514
If you both remain here,
you wiII spoiI it aII

1148
01:27:09,591 --> 01:27:19,592
You can caII me a dog if I don't prove that
she is the MaIu who was in Iove with me

1149
01:27:19,667 --> 01:27:27,369
I wiII take off her mask with
which she is fooIing peopIe here too

1150
01:27:27,675 --> 01:27:36,640
I wiII get married to her
and make 5 to 8 babies too

1151
01:27:36,718 --> 01:27:37,980
Light the fire...

1152
01:27:59,974 --> 01:28:01,339
Did you keep the crackers here?

1153
01:28:01,609 --> 01:28:02,667
No, I did not

1154
01:28:04,212 --> 01:28:05,270
You?...

1155
01:28:17,725 --> 01:28:18,692
Let me teII you...

1156
01:28:18,926 --> 01:28:20,951
You need not taIk too much

1157
01:28:22,463 --> 01:28:24,931
- I wiII not beIieve you
- You have to

1158
01:28:25,066 --> 01:28:29,025
- No, I wiII not
- You have to

1159
01:28:29,137 --> 01:28:30,627
Leave that...where are you now?

1160
01:28:30,938 --> 01:28:35,170
I am in Chandana's oId bungaIow
I am just seeing around the pIace

1161
01:28:35,243 --> 01:28:36,505
-Are you aIone?
- Yes

1162
01:28:36,611 --> 01:28:37,635
ShaII I come too?

1163
01:28:47,155 --> 01:28:50,682
WiII he come in search of you?
Or wiII you go in search of him?

1164
01:28:53,061 --> 01:28:54,585
What is it?

1165
01:28:55,697 --> 01:28:57,597
Who are you?

1166
01:28:57,665 --> 01:29:00,600
I am Ruku
Do you want to see my actuaI seIf?.

1167
01:29:33,267 --> 01:29:34,359
You there...

1168
01:29:35,203 --> 01:29:39,640
The wedding is just 10 to 15 days away
WiII you be abIe to root Ruku by then?

1169
01:29:39,707 --> 01:29:42,676
This is not a cow to just
tie it up so easiIy

1170
01:29:42,910 --> 01:29:44,878
There is a time for everything

1171
01:29:44,946 --> 01:29:48,643
You wiII have powerfuI chants, isn't it
Why can't you use it?

1172
01:29:48,916 --> 01:29:51,077
I wiII use it...
But, she has to aIIow me to

1173
01:29:51,185 --> 01:29:54,313
She is fIying away Iike a untied kite

1174
01:29:54,389 --> 01:29:56,687
- How many days more for the wedding?
- 16 days

1175
01:29:57,725 --> 01:30:01,126
Let us do both the rituaIs together

1176
01:30:01,729 --> 01:30:04,425
Do you mean to say, my death?

1177
01:30:04,532 --> 01:30:07,990
No...the wedding and rooting the ghost!

1178
01:30:12,707 --> 01:30:15,198
This is Chandana's fiance, Giridhar

1179
01:30:16,911 --> 01:30:18,401
Greetings, dear!

1180
01:30:30,124 --> 01:30:33,184
He is the sorcerer who has come to free
the bungaIow from the ghost

1181
01:30:33,261 --> 01:30:34,353
He is a smart one!

1182
01:30:34,629 --> 01:30:36,290
Take the boxes inside

1183
01:30:46,340 --> 01:30:47,500
Why are you here?

1184
01:30:48,676 --> 01:30:51,975
I want to as you the same question...
Why are you here?

1185
01:30:52,213 --> 01:30:55,341
I am getting married to Chandana

1186
01:30:55,416 --> 01:30:59,216
I had aIready decided to get married
to her, before you

1187
01:31:00,154 --> 01:31:03,385
I know what your intentions are
You want to kidnap her, isn't it?

1188
01:31:03,724 --> 01:31:07,683
Sending peopIe to kidnap the girI
you are getting married to,

1189
01:31:08,062 --> 01:31:10,053
...was aIso a kind of kidnapping, isn't it?

1190
01:31:16,070 --> 01:31:17,196
Look who is here!

1191
01:31:19,607 --> 01:31:21,336
Come fast

1192
01:31:42,497 --> 01:31:46,695
I bought this to free us from the fears
But, Iooks Iike it wiII not be enough

1193
01:31:47,068 --> 01:31:54,099
Sometimes, the guts that we cannot get
from the chants, these drinks wiII...

1194
01:31:54,208 --> 01:31:57,200
- Let the ghost come now
- Yes...

1195
01:34:08,142 --> 01:34:10,440
Looks Iike Ruku is out

1196
01:34:11,245 --> 01:34:13,406
Go on...

1197
01:34:13,547 --> 01:34:14,912
Go, get her

1198
01:34:15,016 --> 01:34:18,179
This drink gives you
more powerthan the chants

1199
01:34:18,319 --> 01:34:20,184
You have the power in you now
So, go now

1200
01:34:20,254 --> 01:34:22,688
- You are Battathiri's son, isn't it?
- Yes, I am

1201
01:34:22,923 --> 01:34:24,982
So, you have to get
hoId of the ghost, isn't it?

1202
01:34:25,126 --> 01:34:26,423
- Yes, I wiII
- You are a boId one, isn't it?

1203
01:34:26,527 --> 01:34:27,494
- Yes, I am
- Come aIong with me

1204
01:34:27,595 --> 01:34:30,655
I am some, BaIakrishnan's son...
My father is no Bhattathiri

1205
01:34:30,931 --> 01:34:32,899
- you aIso can come
- So, why shouId I come?

1206
01:34:33,134 --> 01:34:35,694
- So, you can come with me
- ShouId I?

1207
01:34:35,936 --> 01:34:38,302
Come on...
Let me do the accounts

1208
01:34:38,372 --> 01:34:41,307
The noise came from this side

1209
01:34:44,679 --> 01:34:46,909
The bucket is shaking...

1210
01:34:46,981 --> 01:34:48,175
Why are you caIIing me that?

1211
01:34:49,083 --> 01:34:50,948
The bucket is shaking...

1212
01:35:05,499 --> 01:35:07,228
It seems some girI is inside

1213
01:35:07,735 --> 01:35:08,963
- It is her
- Who?

1214
01:35:09,036 --> 01:35:10,060
The ghost!

1215
01:35:10,504 --> 01:35:12,938
Let us puII her up

1216
01:35:13,441 --> 01:35:16,342
How did she go inside the weII?

1217
01:35:16,410 --> 01:35:18,435
We wiII find out from her
once she is out

1218
01:35:18,679 --> 01:35:20,579
You are so boId

1219
01:35:20,681 --> 01:35:23,172
It is because of the drink in me

1220
01:35:24,118 --> 01:35:25,142
Come on, puII...

1221
01:35:30,624 --> 01:35:33,457
The ghost is so heavy

1222
01:35:34,662 --> 01:35:36,994
- It is her
- Her?.

1223
01:35:37,131 --> 01:35:37,688
This is MaIu

1224
01:35:37,932 --> 01:35:39,991
Why did we take the troubIe
to Iife this one up?

1225
01:35:40,101 --> 01:35:41,125
Drop her back in

1226
01:35:41,202 --> 01:35:44,535
- PIease, don't do that!...
- Drop her...

1227
01:35:44,605 --> 01:35:46,698
I wiII faII too

1228
01:35:46,941 --> 01:35:50,138
She is unconscious now

1229
01:35:50,578 --> 01:35:52,876
Ayiaoh...my back is paining

1230
01:35:53,013 --> 01:35:54,071
What is happening here?

1231
01:35:54,181 --> 01:35:56,513
Why are you here at this hour?

1232
01:35:56,617 --> 01:35:59,313
We got drunk and came out
to find this girI in the weII

1233
01:35:59,386 --> 01:36:02,116
- You...
- We found her inside the weII

1234
01:36:02,223 --> 01:36:04,589
Oh god...Iet us carry her

1235
01:36:04,658 --> 01:36:05,920
I'II carry her

1236
01:36:05,993 --> 01:36:07,620
You don't have to carry her

1237
01:36:07,695 --> 01:36:10,289
I meant to say that,
she has to be taken inside the house

1238
01:36:10,364 --> 01:36:12,264
He wiII heIp, carry her in

1239
01:36:12,600 --> 01:36:13,931
HoId her...

1240
01:36:20,941 --> 01:36:24,399
It was past midnight
when my inner intuition,

1241
01:36:24,545 --> 01:36:34,181
...woke me up teIIing me that
there is danger near the weII

1242
01:36:34,288 --> 01:36:35,915
The fore-fathers have woken you up

1243
01:36:35,990 --> 01:36:38,390
See, in spite of Iacking basic
knowIedge, he has understood it

1244
01:36:38,459 --> 01:36:40,324
You have to get rid of this soon

1245
01:36:40,394 --> 01:36:45,957
There is an expensive rituaI to counter Ioss
which can actuaIIy soIve the issue

1246
01:36:46,066 --> 01:36:48,364
- Money is not the issue here
- For me too

1247
01:36:48,435 --> 01:36:51,233
- The girI's Iife is priority for us
- For me too

1248
01:36:51,338 --> 01:36:53,704
- Grandfather...
- I know what has to be done

1249
01:36:53,941 --> 01:36:54,703
What is it?

1250
01:36:55,509 --> 01:36:58,501
We require an abIe sorcerer
to root the ghost

1251
01:36:58,579 --> 01:36:59,603
I am right here!

1252
01:36:59,713 --> 01:37:01,578
This guy doesn't know anything

1253
01:37:03,250 --> 01:37:05,582
Have you been possessed
by an EngIish ghost?

1254
01:37:07,087 --> 01:37:13,219
Ustad Maanpuram Maayamkutty Sheikh,
is a person who can get rid of aII eviIs

1255
01:37:13,294 --> 01:37:15,922
He wiII onIy need a day ortwo
to parceI away the ghost

1256
01:37:16,030 --> 01:37:19,898
Is he running a courier company
to parceI away the ghost?

1257
01:37:19,967 --> 01:37:21,195
What is the need for it?

1258
01:37:21,268 --> 01:37:23,930
It is aIways good
to have a second opinion

1259
01:37:24,004 --> 01:37:27,201
The person whom the ghost
Iikes more can get rid of it

1260
01:37:27,274 --> 01:37:33,144
Yes, Iet anyone do it
But, you wiII see the repercussions too

1261
01:37:34,215 --> 01:37:36,649
Who did you say is coming?

1262
01:37:36,717 --> 01:37:39,311
Ustad Maampuram Maayankutty Sheikh

1263
01:37:52,733 --> 01:37:54,291
- Wife...
- Yes

1264
01:37:54,435 --> 01:37:55,561
Come on

1265
01:37:58,272 --> 01:38:00,604
Ustad, we were waiting for you
Come in

1266
01:38:05,946 --> 01:38:07,607
We can eat Iater on

1267
01:38:07,715 --> 01:38:10,275
There is pIenty of time for that
Let me finish my job first

1268
01:38:10,384 --> 01:38:13,217
Greetings to you aII!

1269
01:38:13,320 --> 01:38:16,585
Is there a poIiticaI meet happening here?
Why is there a big crowd here?

1270
01:38:16,690 --> 01:38:19,124
These are the peopIe in this famiIy

1271
01:38:20,361 --> 01:38:22,989
Has there been no partition here?

1272
01:38:23,130 --> 01:38:26,429
They are friends of
my wouId-be daughter-in-Iaw

1273
01:38:27,434 --> 01:38:30,028
Oops! I just stamped a viper!...

1274
01:38:30,504 --> 01:38:32,699
Move away, aII of you...

1275
01:38:33,307 --> 01:38:35,707
- What happened?
- l can smell a gin (evil spirit) here

1276
01:38:35,943 --> 01:38:38,104
Nobody has gin or rum here

1277
01:38:38,279 --> 01:38:41,339
It is the smeII of a femaIe ghost
Not the drink

1278
01:38:41,415 --> 01:38:42,575
Don't get scared

1279
01:38:42,683 --> 01:38:44,548
I wiII give you the eggs
that I had chanted with

1280
01:38:44,652 --> 01:38:46,677
Your fears wiII aII be gone
Get me the eggs

1281
01:38:47,321 --> 01:38:50,620
I wiII give you aII the eggs
Open it...

1282
01:38:50,991 --> 01:38:54,358
So many peopIe and very few eggs
You deserve a...

1283
01:38:54,495 --> 01:38:57,589
No eggs forthe men
The Iadies can have it

1284
01:38:57,698 --> 01:38:58,995
Take this

1285
01:38:59,133 --> 01:39:01,533
I am getting the eggs
ready for the men

1286
01:39:01,602 --> 01:39:03,001
I wiII give it to you Iater

1287
01:39:03,103 --> 01:39:04,161
Who is this?

1288
01:39:06,006 --> 01:39:09,032
Oh god, aII vipers around here!

1289
01:39:13,647 --> 01:39:16,172
Take this
Do not fear anymore

1290
01:39:17,718 --> 01:39:19,515
- How oId are you?
- 20

1291
01:39:19,586 --> 01:39:22,214
Let us start with the rituaIs
Come on

1292
01:39:23,157 --> 01:39:27,116
This is a nationaI highway inside the house

1293
01:39:29,697 --> 01:39:31,460
Let me handIe him now

1294
01:39:33,367 --> 01:39:34,493
Come out...

1295
01:39:41,675 --> 01:39:45,304
We have come here for the rituaIs
That is the house

1296
01:39:45,379 --> 01:39:46,505
Go and beg there

1297
01:39:47,414 --> 01:39:51,282
I have not come here to beg
I am here to get rid of you beggars

1298
01:39:51,352 --> 01:39:56,949
Take your stuff and Ieave tonight
Don't make things difficuIt for me

1299
01:39:57,257 --> 01:39:59,487
It is sad that you have
come here to teII me this

1300
01:39:59,560 --> 01:40:00,686
Oh, god!...

1301
01:40:01,061 --> 01:40:05,964
Ghosts and spirits shiver in fright
when they hear of my name

1302
01:40:06,066 --> 01:40:08,034
Don't force me to start the rituaIs now

1303
01:40:08,135 --> 01:40:10,103
We have not been moved
by even biggerfears

1304
01:40:10,204 --> 01:40:11,398
So, why wouId we fear you?

1305
01:40:11,472 --> 01:40:15,568
You don't have to put up aII this drama
He is ManapiIIy Bhattathiri's son

1306
01:40:15,709 --> 01:40:18,337
I don't care whose son you are

1307
01:40:18,445 --> 01:40:22,040
If the father was a mahout, how wiII
the son have a wart on his ass

1308
01:40:22,116 --> 01:40:24,016
See it for yourseIf
Look for it...

1309
01:40:24,118 --> 01:40:26,416
This scar is a genitaI one

1310
01:40:28,122 --> 01:40:30,920
Your face shows that
you are a faIse sorcerer

1311
01:40:30,991 --> 01:40:33,482
Chant something and get rid of him...

1312
01:40:34,495 --> 01:40:36,429
See, it is impossibIe

1313
01:40:36,530 --> 01:40:40,398
If you are a reaI one,
answer to my question

1314
01:40:40,501 --> 01:40:41,695
My question is...

1315
01:40:43,337 --> 01:40:52,245
l will come every night
till my wish has been fulfilled

1316
01:40:52,379 --> 01:40:55,314
TeII me which ghost sang this
and in which movie

1317
01:40:55,416 --> 01:40:57,350
- Can you give us a cIue?
- Answer this, if you are a reaI sorcerer

1318
01:40:57,451 --> 01:40:58,679
- Can we have a cIue?
- Yes

1319
01:40:58,952 --> 01:41:02,149
- She drapes a white cIoth in it
- Is it a porn movie?

1320
01:41:02,256 --> 01:41:04,554
She waIks without cIothes
in that, isn't it?

1321
01:41:05,059 --> 01:41:08,028
I knew that you
were faIse sorcerers

1322
01:41:08,128 --> 01:41:12,292
Do you see this egg?
It was Iaid by a white hen

1323
01:41:14,468 --> 01:41:18,905
If I circIe it thrice Iike this,
around your head and break it,

1324
01:41:19,006 --> 01:41:22,169
...your head wiII break too

1325
01:41:22,276 --> 01:41:25,268
So, Ieave this house tonight itseIf

1326
01:41:25,345 --> 01:41:26,175
What if I don't?

1327
01:41:26,280 --> 01:41:29,408
I wiII break the egg
and your head wiII break too

1328
01:41:29,516 --> 01:41:31,484
Throw it...

1329
01:41:31,552 --> 01:41:33,918
Don't force me to do it
I wiII break it....

1330
01:41:34,021 --> 01:41:35,454
Break it...

1331
01:41:35,556 --> 01:41:37,990
Leave me aIone
I wiII have a headache

1332
01:41:38,058 --> 01:41:41,550
I wiII throw it now
You are Iucky now

1333
01:41:41,628 --> 01:41:44,290
This happened to be a boiIed egg
and not a raw one

1334
01:41:44,364 --> 01:41:49,529
I wiII come with a raw egg tomorrow
I am asking you for the Iast time

1335
01:41:49,603 --> 01:41:51,195
Can you get out of here?

1336
01:41:51,305 --> 01:41:56,004
I wiII not Ieave tiII the spirit
has been got rid of

1337
01:41:56,110 --> 01:42:01,377
Let us see who gets rid of the spirit
I am taking up this chaIIenge

1338
01:42:01,448 --> 01:42:04,246
Oh god...a ghost
Move away, you deviI

1339
01:42:04,318 --> 01:42:05,114
Who is this one?

1340
01:42:05,185 --> 01:42:07,176
I shouId have a protection myseIf

1341
01:42:07,621 --> 01:42:13,321
I took the egg, circIed it thrice above
his head and when I was about to break it,

1342
01:42:13,460 --> 01:42:19,558
They feII on my feet, crying aIoud
asking me not to kiII them

1343
01:42:19,633 --> 01:42:20,657
Are you sure?

1344
01:42:20,734 --> 01:42:23,328
Can I go the day after tomorrow?
I am too tired now

1345
01:42:23,403 --> 01:42:25,064
I am asking you
about those peopIe

1346
01:42:25,139 --> 01:42:27,664
There is no doubt about that
Otherwise, I wiII use the next trick

1347
01:42:27,741 --> 01:42:30,107
- Enough...
- ShaII I fry you an egg?

1348
01:42:30,277 --> 01:42:32,074
Someone wiII hear you
PIease, go now

1349
01:42:32,179 --> 01:42:33,703
No one shouId hear?

1350
01:42:40,754 --> 01:42:43,120
- Who are you?
- I am Biyatu

1351
01:42:43,390 --> 01:42:45,517
How can you be here
in this bungaIow?

1352
01:42:45,592 --> 01:42:47,958
I am waiting for my husband

1353
01:42:48,362 --> 01:42:53,129
My husband has come here to do
the massage treatment for the master, BeIIi

1354
01:42:53,267 --> 01:42:58,330
SuIaiman, you have Iost now!

1355
01:42:58,438 --> 01:43:02,340
I Iive there in the out-house
I am scared to waIk aIone

1356
01:43:03,043 --> 01:43:07,275
My husband wiII get Iate
I am tired of waiting for him

1357
01:43:10,117 --> 01:43:12,051
ShaII I give you company?

1358
01:43:12,119 --> 01:43:14,644
WiII it not be difficuIt for you?

1359
01:43:14,755 --> 01:43:17,121
No, not at aII!
Come on

1360
01:43:24,064 --> 01:43:27,898
Do you know why I am here?
It is for an egg rituaI

1361
01:43:28,202 --> 01:43:33,697
You are Iooking Iike an angeI

1362
01:43:34,007 --> 01:43:35,372
Don't mock me

1363
01:43:35,475 --> 01:43:39,104
Do not run away
PIease wait!

1364
01:43:39,580 --> 01:43:42,208
WiII your husband get back too Iate?

1365
01:43:42,316 --> 01:43:43,248
Yes

1366
01:43:43,617 --> 01:43:47,314
- ShaII I come into the house?
- What for?

1367
01:43:47,988 --> 01:43:51,014
Don't behave so innocent

1368
01:43:56,964 --> 01:44:00,900
- What do you want to drink?
- Get me whatever you Iike

1369
01:44:00,968 --> 01:44:02,629
Something coId or some bIood?

1370
01:44:02,703 --> 01:44:05,695
Anything wiII do...
BIood?...

1371
01:44:08,375 --> 01:44:10,707
Oh god...

1372
01:44:20,554 --> 01:44:22,920
It's a ghost...

1373
01:44:24,992 --> 01:44:30,089
You are there
Here too?...

1374
01:44:30,230 --> 01:44:33,427
Oh my god...she is again here?

1375
01:44:33,533 --> 01:44:36,001
Is this ghosts' procession?

1376
01:44:36,169 --> 01:44:37,659
Save me, God

1377
01:44:38,672 --> 01:44:40,663
I have escaped!

1378
01:44:43,010 --> 01:44:44,910
Get Iost...

1379
01:44:46,179 --> 01:44:48,443
There is a ghost

1380
01:44:48,615 --> 01:44:51,277
I am here to safeguard you aII

1381
01:44:51,351 --> 01:44:53,717
Don't worry
I wiII seep here tonight

1382
01:44:53,987 --> 01:44:55,181
Get up

1383
01:44:55,455 --> 01:44:58,618
PIease, don't throw me out
I am scared of the ghost

1384
01:44:58,959 --> 01:45:01,553
Poor souI is petrified
seeing something

1385
01:45:01,628 --> 01:45:03,596
- It is a Friday today
- Friday?

1386
01:45:03,730 --> 01:45:07,530
Is that why a haIf-fried creature
was chasing me?

1387
01:45:07,601 --> 01:45:09,466
You are a smart one, isn't it?

1388
01:45:09,603 --> 01:45:11,696
- Don't Iie!
- What?

1389
01:45:11,938 --> 01:45:14,270
I am PayaruvaIa Pappan

1390
01:45:14,374 --> 01:45:15,398
Who is that with you?

1391
01:45:15,509 --> 01:45:16,703
- That is my wife
- What?

1392
01:45:17,010 --> 01:45:20,241
Don't hit me
She is arranged too

1393
01:45:20,747 --> 01:45:22,510
Get out of here right now

1394
01:45:22,582 --> 01:45:23,947
I want to teII you something

1395
01:45:24,051 --> 01:45:26,042
I have reaIized how powerfuI you are

1396
01:45:26,153 --> 01:45:29,418
The ghost chased me tiII here
but has not come in

1397
01:45:29,523 --> 01:45:31,081
PIease do not throw me out

1398
01:45:31,158 --> 01:45:33,126
She wiII finish me off
I am frightened

1399
01:45:33,226 --> 01:45:33,954
Poor souI!

1400
01:45:34,061 --> 01:45:38,657
Do one thing
Give him 2 pegs of that drink

1401
01:45:38,965 --> 01:45:40,125
- No, thanks!
- Okay, forget it

1402
01:45:40,233 --> 01:45:42,064
I mean to say,
I don't want water in my drink

1403
01:45:42,202 --> 01:45:44,670
I am not used to
mixing my drink with water

1404
01:45:52,312 --> 01:45:53,336
Ustad...

1405
01:45:54,047 --> 01:45:57,141
I am not a great sorcerer, as you think

1406
01:45:58,418 --> 01:46:03,117
ManapiIIy Bhattathiri's son,
is aII I'm worthy of

1407
01:46:03,523 --> 01:46:07,960
I had decided to Ieave this pIace
But, I am not abIe to

1408
01:46:08,595 --> 01:46:11,428
- I need your heIp
- What for?

1409
01:46:12,632 --> 01:46:20,368
Let us be friends

1410
01:46:31,518 --> 01:46:35,716
Ruku's spirit dweIIs in her

1411
01:46:36,289 --> 01:46:40,350
Ever since I got home, I'm being
harassed using a spirits name

1412
01:46:40,460 --> 01:46:43,156
First, it was a sorcerer and now this one

1413
01:46:43,263 --> 01:46:44,594
- Daughter...
- Leave me aIone

1414
01:46:44,698 --> 01:46:47,292
I have seen the ghost

1415
01:46:47,434 --> 01:46:49,698
She wouId never Iose her temper

1416
01:46:49,970 --> 01:46:51,597
PIease, heIp her

1417
01:46:51,738 --> 01:46:54,036
There is one soIution I can think of

1418
01:46:54,141 --> 01:46:56,473
She has to be taken
to the mosque in Yervaadi

1419
01:46:56,576 --> 01:46:58,305
As you say

1420
01:46:58,478 --> 01:47:02,141
- She wiII not Iisten to anyone
- I wiII handIe that

1421
01:47:02,249 --> 01:47:03,181
Wife...

1422
01:47:03,316 --> 01:47:06,479
Start the preparations
for the journey immediateIy

1423
01:47:06,586 --> 01:47:08,076
Come on, my heIpers...

1424
01:47:10,690 --> 01:47:13,022
My back hurts, bending Iike this

1425
01:47:15,028 --> 01:47:15,858
What is it?

1426
01:47:16,062 --> 01:47:21,261
She wiII be there as we have decided
Give me a hand

1427
01:47:21,401 --> 01:47:24,529
Master...

1428
01:47:26,440 --> 01:47:27,668
What is it?

1429
01:47:27,974 --> 01:47:30,067
He is back
Mukundan Unni

1430
01:47:30,210 --> 01:47:32,201
He is back with Damayanti

1431
01:47:34,047 --> 01:47:36,277
Take the tractors with the workers

1432
01:47:36,383 --> 01:47:39,113
We wiII teach him a Iesson
for having cheated us

1433
01:47:39,186 --> 01:47:41,518
How wiII you teach him a Iesson?

1434
01:47:41,755 --> 01:47:42,722
Come on, wiII you?

1435
01:47:43,590 --> 01:47:47,048
Why is he shouting at me?
Come on, wiII you?

1436
01:48:43,116 --> 01:48:43,605
I'm...

1437
01:48:43,750 --> 01:48:45,911
Mukundan...

1438
01:48:46,152 --> 01:48:47,710
A very famiIiar voice...

1439
01:48:47,988 --> 01:48:50,013
Come out with Damayanti

1440
01:48:50,757 --> 01:48:51,587
Who is it?

1441
01:48:51,658 --> 01:48:53,091
- The Nettikadans
- Oh no

1442
01:48:53,159 --> 01:48:57,926
Why has their madness not ended?
How did they know that we have come?

1443
01:48:57,998 --> 01:48:59,022
We wiII be trapped

1444
01:48:59,132 --> 01:49:01,123
I know we wiII be trapped
That is what I'm trying to soIve

1445
01:49:01,201 --> 01:49:02,691
We wiII have to show Damayanti to them

1446
01:49:02,936 --> 01:49:04,904
Let us introduce her as Damayanti

1447
01:49:05,005 --> 01:49:06,700
But, they have seen Damayanti before

1448
01:49:06,940 --> 01:49:08,999
We can teII them that
she matured in few days time

1449
01:49:09,075 --> 01:49:11,600
Ustad wiII teach you a Iesson
if we show away his wife

1450
01:49:11,711 --> 01:49:12,973
They have not come aIone

1451
01:49:13,113 --> 01:49:14,705
There are 20 peopIe aIong with them
carrying weapons too

1452
01:49:14,948 --> 01:49:16,506
Let me try to handIe this aIone

1453
01:49:16,650 --> 01:49:18,277
Don't you worry
I am there with you

1454
01:49:18,351 --> 01:49:20,717
Oh god, the Nettikadans are
better than this one

1455
01:49:20,954 --> 01:49:22,649
What about him?

1456
01:49:22,722 --> 01:49:24,383
Come here

1457
01:49:24,491 --> 01:49:25,480
I wiII be back soon

1458
01:49:25,592 --> 01:49:29,494
How are you aII?
Hope you aII are fine

1459
01:49:29,596 --> 01:49:31,928
We are not that fine
Do you want some?

1460
01:49:31,998 --> 01:49:32,657
Why did you abscond?

1461
01:49:32,766 --> 01:49:35,633
Abscond?
How can I get back if I've absconded?

1462
01:49:35,735 --> 01:49:37,896
We wiII get you back
if you don't, isn't it?

1463
01:49:38,004 --> 01:49:39,164
Don't Iift it too much

1464
01:49:39,239 --> 01:49:44,939
We had decided your marriages with her
But, herfiance kidnapped herthen

1465
01:49:45,011 --> 01:49:45,978
What is his name?

1466
01:49:46,079 --> 01:49:50,709
P...ppp...Pereira

1467
01:49:51,117 --> 01:49:56,020
We have got her back now
with so much of efforts

1468
01:49:59,759 --> 01:50:02,990
These are Giridhar's peopIe

1469
01:50:03,063 --> 01:50:05,588
TeII them that they are Pereira's men

1470
01:50:05,699 --> 01:50:10,636
They are Pereira's men
They have come to take her again

1471
01:50:10,737 --> 01:50:13,604
This is your chance to prove yourseIves
in front of Damayanti

1472
01:50:13,707 --> 01:50:14,696
If we are abIe to prove?...

1473
01:50:14,941 --> 01:50:16,602
She wiII bow her head for you aII

1474
01:50:17,177 --> 01:50:18,576
Come on, Iet's go

1475
01:50:18,712 --> 01:50:20,009
Stop there!...

1476
01:50:23,717 --> 01:50:28,620
You have grown so much
You shouId use your brains

1477
01:50:28,989 --> 01:50:31,719
You have been so fooIish

1478
01:50:32,092 --> 01:50:34,560
Things have gone this bad,
onIy because I Iistened to you

1479
01:50:34,661 --> 01:50:35,958
Yes...

1480
01:50:36,630 --> 01:50:40,566
If you get married to the oIder one,
you wiII onIy get haIf the property

1481
01:50:40,667 --> 01:50:42,362
That is why I had asked you
to kiII the younger one

1482
01:50:42,469 --> 01:50:43,663
But, what have you done?

1483
01:50:43,770 --> 01:50:45,567
Itjust happened that way

1484
01:50:45,639 --> 01:50:51,703
You shouId have handIed Chandana whiIe
she was on her excursions from coIIege

1485
01:50:52,178 --> 01:50:54,578
There were so many ways forthat

1486
01:50:54,748 --> 01:50:59,515
Chandana does not know
that you were invoIved in it

1487
01:50:59,619 --> 01:51:03,180
But, he does!...
Mukundan Unni does know it

1488
01:51:03,323 --> 01:51:05,621
He can do nothing...

1489
01:51:06,359 --> 01:51:07,656
Why did you want to see me?

1490
01:51:08,495 --> 01:51:10,190
Unniadri toId me that you are going back

1491
01:51:10,296 --> 01:51:11,354
Yes, I have to

1492
01:51:11,564 --> 01:51:14,965
Since MaIu has reaIized the truth now,
I can go back peacefuIIy

1493
01:51:15,035 --> 01:51:16,161
PeacefuIIy?

1494
01:51:16,236 --> 01:51:21,606
Yes, when you get married and have kids,
you now have a story to entertain them with

1495
01:51:21,708 --> 01:51:25,303
You Ioved me a Iot, even
when I had Iost my memory

1496
01:51:25,412 --> 01:51:29,610
I, hurt you a Iot unintentionaIIy

1497
01:51:29,949 --> 01:51:32,417
It was not intentionaI

1498
01:51:32,619 --> 01:51:34,177
I know it aII now

1499
01:51:38,558 --> 01:51:42,551
I want someone who Ioves me
and not my property

1500
01:51:42,762 --> 01:51:47,631
Giridhar wanted to get married
to the Chandana, who has aII the Iuxuries

1501
01:51:48,201 --> 01:51:54,003
I preferto Iive as the MaIu,
whom you Ioved

1502
01:51:55,075 --> 01:51:59,603
Can I become that MaIu again?

1503
01:52:30,076 --> 01:52:31,043
Who are you?

1504
01:52:31,211 --> 01:52:33,543
You have decided and
finaIized it aII, isn't it?

1505
01:52:33,646 --> 01:52:35,375
What?
Who are you?

1506
01:52:37,350 --> 01:52:40,649
You want Mukundan Unni,
but not Giridhar!

1507
01:52:41,054 --> 01:52:45,320
You have decided your marriage,
aII by yourseIf

1508
01:52:47,327 --> 01:52:49,386
I wiII not aIIow you
to Iive with anyone

1509
01:52:58,772 --> 01:53:03,505
You cannot escape from me
I wiII destroy everybody

1510
01:53:03,576 --> 01:53:05,601
TeII me, who you are...

1511
01:53:06,613 --> 01:53:09,343
You want to know
who I am, isn't it?

1512
01:53:38,178 --> 01:53:41,147
Let us go to a pub after shopping

1513
01:53:43,149 --> 01:53:44,275
Grandfather...

1514
01:53:44,484 --> 01:53:46,008
Where are you off to?

1515
01:53:46,119 --> 01:53:49,213
Going out shopping with Giri
Do you want to join us?

1516
01:53:50,523 --> 01:53:52,081
I have a news for you

1517
01:53:52,192 --> 01:53:57,095
I have pressurized my uncIe from US
to come for the wedding

1518
01:53:57,197 --> 01:54:00,257
Is that why you are Iooking so happy!

1519
01:54:00,366 --> 01:54:02,527
You are Veerendran's darIing...

1520
01:54:25,959 --> 01:54:37,735
Memories when caressed gently
Streams born silently

1521
01:54:39,572 --> 01:54:51,780
Pair of eyes brimming in tears
Streaming slowly down the cheeks

1522
01:54:53,253 --> 01:55:05,893
ln a jungle so lovely, in a nest unseen
lives a distressed bird full of yearnings

1523
01:55:16,342 --> 01:55:21,405
Are you pIaying the fooI with me again?
I cannot understand this, MaIu

1524
01:55:21,648 --> 01:55:23,240
Why are you Iike this?

1525
01:55:23,950 --> 01:55:26,578
Don't come near me

1526
01:55:27,186 --> 01:55:32,180
I was ready to Ieave this pIace
But, you heId me back

1527
01:55:32,592 --> 01:55:35,083
What is it, MaIu?
What is the meaning of aII this?

1528
01:55:35,495 --> 01:55:37,156
- I want to know
- No...

1529
01:55:38,631 --> 01:55:42,727
I don't Iike you
I hate you coming near me

1530
01:55:43,002 --> 01:55:44,230
Go away!...

1531
01:55:44,304 --> 01:55:47,398
How can you hate me in a night's time?
What happened?

1532
01:55:47,573 --> 01:55:49,097
I want to know the reason

1533
01:55:56,349 --> 01:55:57,407
Get Iost

1534
01:55:58,618 --> 01:56:00,984
I wiII kiII you,
if you come near me

1535
01:56:01,754 --> 01:56:05,383
Who is MaIu?
I am no MaIu or Chandana

1536
01:56:05,491 --> 01:56:06,480
I am Ruku

1537
01:56:06,592 --> 01:56:09,686
I have come to destroy the bungaIow

1538
01:56:09,963 --> 01:56:14,525
I have possessed her, you are next
and then the bungaIow

1539
01:56:14,634 --> 01:56:19,196
You want to tie me up?
Yourfather did, Iong ago

1540
01:56:19,305 --> 01:56:21,705
I have taken a re-birth again

1541
01:56:22,075 --> 01:56:25,567
Come on, if you can tie me up
without any knowIedge of the rituaIs

1542
01:56:29,349 --> 01:56:31,146
Come and tie me up

1543
01:56:43,763 --> 01:56:46,163
I never beIieved in aII this

1544
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:51,403
During my chiIdhood, I used to be
scared when my dad tried to teach me

1545
01:56:51,537 --> 01:56:55,564
I had forgotten aII
what my dad had taught me

1546
01:56:56,542 --> 01:57:01,275
But, right now, my heart is fuII of
gratitude for my dad

1547
01:57:01,447 --> 01:57:03,642
Keep thinking about your father
and carry on with it

1548
01:57:03,783 --> 01:57:06,251
You have it in you
through so many generations

1549
01:57:06,352 --> 01:57:08,081
You have to make use of it

1550
01:57:09,088 --> 01:57:12,990
There wiII be both,
the good and the eviI

1551
01:57:13,126 --> 01:57:16,653
You can tie her up
OnIy you can!

1552
01:58:02,975 --> 01:58:08,345
Lovely night of March-April
in a golden chariot came this way

1553
01:58:08,448 --> 01:58:13,750
Standing resplendent,
as a bride like me now

1554
01:58:13,853 --> 01:58:19,291
Lovely night of March-April
in a golden chariot came this way

1555
01:58:19,392 --> 01:58:24,694
Standing resplendent,
as a bride like me now

1556
01:58:24,797 --> 01:58:35,640
My friend, the flowers you braided for Cupid
What Radha, too created for her Lord Krishna

1557
01:58:35,741 --> 01:58:44,513
Were garlands of spring in varied hues
Suffused with overwhelming perfumes

1558
01:58:46,586 --> 01:58:51,990
Lovely night of March-April
in a golden chariot came this way

1559
01:58:52,091 --> 01:58:57,791
Standing resplendent,
as a bride like me now

1560
01:59:19,585 --> 01:59:30,621
Divine nymphs came to make me companions
The lovely swans of my imagination

1561
01:59:35,935 --> 01:59:41,567
Eyes lined with kohl,
musical stars in a row

1562
01:59:41,674 --> 01:59:46,634
Moonbeams like palms
offering sandal paste perfumed

1563
01:59:46,746 --> 01:59:49,374
Aroused and awakened the arena of game

1564
01:59:49,482 --> 01:59:52,007
As the drums within
the heart thundered and beat

1565
01:59:52,118 --> 02:00:02,790
As God of Love adorned you on him
My Lord too, merged in my everlasting beauty

1566
02:00:02,895 --> 02:00:08,458
Lovely night of March-April
in a golden chariot came this way

1567
02:00:08,568 --> 02:00:14,063
Standing resplendent,
as a bride like me now

1568
02:00:41,601 --> 02:00:47,039
As clouds created a stage
for lascivious dances

1569
02:00:47,106 --> 02:00:52,567
The nightingales orchestrated
musical pieces

1570
02:00:58,017 --> 02:01:03,421
As the edge of tender leaves
turned couches of past time

1571
02:01:03,522 --> 02:01:08,516
Romantic unions continued
captivating and erotic

1572
02:01:08,628 --> 02:01:13,930
Assembling a place like we dreamed
lnviting us were messengers of love

1573
02:01:14,033 --> 02:01:19,335
Savoring the sweetness of celestial Veena

1574
02:01:19,438 --> 02:01:24,398
Perform, sanctified in aisles of heaven,
an alluring dance

1575
02:01:24,844 --> 02:01:30,407
Lovely night of March-April
in a golden chariot came this way

1576
02:01:30,516 --> 02:01:35,852
Standing resplendent,
as a bride like me now

1577
02:01:35,955 --> 02:01:46,763
My friend, the flowers you braided for Cupid
What Radha, too created for her Lord Krishna

1578
02:01:46,866 --> 02:01:55,069
Were garlands of spring in varied hues
Suffused with overwhelming perfumes

1579
02:02:38,184 --> 02:02:40,744
You cannot do anything to me

1580
02:02:43,622 --> 02:02:44,589
Sit down

1581
02:02:47,360 --> 02:02:48,292
No, I wiII not

1582
02:02:48,461 --> 02:02:50,656
Your spirit is wandering
without freedom

1583
02:02:50,763 --> 02:02:53,732
Let go off her!
Obey me!

1584
02:02:56,669 --> 02:03:01,629
No, I wiII not Ieave her,
tiII my wiII is done

1585
02:03:01,974 --> 02:03:03,635
I wiII make you obey me

1586
02:03:03,776 --> 02:03:07,473
You, being a Iiving being, not matter
what you try, I wiII not Ieave tiII I take

1587
02:03:07,580 --> 02:03:12,017
...revenge on the peopIe who have
spoiIed my Iife that, I couId have Iived

1588
02:03:12,118 --> 02:03:14,450
Births and deaths are the wiII of god

1589
02:03:14,587 --> 02:03:17,215
Spirits do not have
the right to remain on earth

1590
02:03:17,590 --> 02:03:20,081
That is why my father
had rooted you once

1591
02:03:20,226 --> 02:03:23,525
That is how you have
become my enemy too

1592
02:03:23,596 --> 02:03:27,657
You do not know anything, nothing at aII
Do you know the fire burning in me,

1593
02:03:27,767 --> 02:03:31,601
...the sufferings I went through
Do you know it?

1594
02:03:33,706 --> 02:03:45,243
Memories when caressed gently
Streams born silently

1595
02:03:47,119 --> 02:03:59,554
Pair of eyes brimming in tears
Streaming slowly down the cheeks

1596
02:04:01,167 --> 02:04:05,263
We cannot Iive together in this horribIe
Iand where my oIder brothers are around too

1597
02:04:05,404 --> 02:04:08,134
We have to go off to a pIace
where they cannot find us

1598
02:04:08,574 --> 02:04:09,598
Won't you come with me?

1599
02:04:09,675 --> 02:04:11,233
What if your brothers come to know?

1600
02:04:11,610 --> 02:04:15,137
Nobody wiII get to know
We wiII be in another pIace

1601
02:04:15,414 --> 02:04:19,407
...before dawn tomorrow
Nobody can find us there

1602
02:04:35,134 --> 02:04:35,657
What is it?

1603
02:04:35,734 --> 02:04:37,099
- Where is your daughter?
- Why do you ask?

1604
02:04:37,203 --> 02:04:39,501
Move away...

1605
02:04:40,339 --> 02:04:41,169
Father...

1606
02:04:41,540 --> 02:04:43,064
Leave him
Get Iost...

1607
02:04:43,676 --> 02:04:44,404
My daughter...

1608
02:04:44,510 --> 02:04:48,640
You want to get married
to our younger brother, isn't it?

1609
02:04:52,218 --> 02:04:54,379
- I wiII kiII aII of you
- What is it?

1610
02:04:58,791 --> 02:05:00,349
PIease do not harm us

1611
02:05:04,029 --> 02:05:05,758
- Mother...
- Come here...

1612
02:05:29,121 --> 02:05:30,486
She is not around

1613
02:05:31,457 --> 02:05:32,287
What is it?

1614
02:06:00,653 --> 02:06:03,952
Ruku...

1615
02:06:04,790 --> 02:06:07,759
Let me go...

1616
02:06:20,306 --> 02:06:21,432
Take him away

1617
02:06:23,175 --> 02:06:25,507
The fire of revenge in me is more

1618
02:06:25,611 --> 02:06:27,408
powerfuI than the fire
for these rituaIs

1619
02:06:27,646 --> 02:06:32,674
You are dweIIing in a rented body now
She has a heart too

1620
02:06:33,152 --> 02:06:37,748
I wiII not aIIow you to behave seIfishIy
by being in her body

1621
02:06:38,290 --> 02:06:42,090
I am going to trap you
in this for your freedom

1622
02:06:42,695 --> 02:06:45,596
...and for the safety of aII
the peopIe in this famiIy

1623
02:06:45,698 --> 02:06:48,258
No, no...

1624
02:06:56,308 --> 02:06:58,742
No

1625
02:07:06,785 --> 02:07:09,151
Don't do this, Ieave me...

1626
02:07:33,379 --> 02:07:34,471
What is it?

1627
02:07:36,382 --> 02:07:37,508
Father...

1628
02:07:50,095 --> 02:07:51,460
What did you do to her?.

1629
02:07:51,597 --> 02:07:55,055
Ruku's spirit is there in her body

1630
02:08:01,340 --> 02:08:03,103
What is it, my dear?.

1631
02:08:03,208 --> 02:08:05,073
He...

1632
02:08:05,244 --> 02:08:07,269
Get him out of the house

1633
02:08:07,479 --> 02:08:08,503
Get out

1634
02:08:11,383 --> 02:08:12,748
Giri, what is this?

1635
02:08:13,185 --> 02:08:14,413
Leave him

1636
02:08:23,429 --> 02:08:26,262
Don't you dare to touch me
We wiII go away

1637
02:08:26,532 --> 02:08:28,363
But, you aII have to
remember one thing

1638
02:08:28,434 --> 02:08:34,100
You have to fear him more than
Ruku's spirit in the bungaIow

1639
02:08:35,207 --> 02:08:36,231
Come on...

1640
02:09:32,097 --> 02:09:35,658
I wouId have come to the airport
if I had known that you are coming today

1641
02:09:35,768 --> 02:09:39,101
I wanted to surprise you aII
How are you, UncIe?

1642
02:09:39,204 --> 02:09:40,262
I am fine

1643
02:09:40,539 --> 02:09:42,234
- MaIathi, are you fine?
- Yes, I am fine

1644
02:09:43,242 --> 02:09:45,472
- Where is your fiance, Chandana?
- She is inside

1645
02:09:45,778 --> 02:09:47,746
Come on, Iet's go inside

1646
02:09:58,991 --> 02:10:00,117
UncIe...

1647
02:11:40,325 --> 02:11:42,122
UncIe, what is wrong?

1648
02:11:59,811 --> 02:12:01,210
What happened?

1649
02:12:01,346 --> 02:12:04,611
Someone tried to
suffocate me with a piIIow

1650
02:12:05,017 --> 02:12:07,383
- I couId not see the person
- I suppose, it was a dream

1651
02:12:09,288 --> 02:12:10,448
Get Iost, don't be fooIish

1652
02:12:11,590 --> 02:12:12,648
It was not a dream

1653
02:12:13,025 --> 02:12:15,357
Be carefuI, there is a spirit
wandering around here

1654
02:12:15,494 --> 02:12:16,461
Don't scare him

1655
02:12:16,695 --> 02:12:20,256
- What is it, uncIe?
- It was Iike a dream

1656
02:12:20,399 --> 02:12:24,301
Let us see around the pIace
It has been so Iong for you

1657
02:12:24,569 --> 02:12:26,093
Come on, uncIe

1658
02:12:26,305 --> 02:12:27,135
That's true

1659
02:12:27,239 --> 02:12:29,707
Go on...she is requesting you, isn't it?

1660
02:12:29,808 --> 02:12:32,140
Do not go near the bridge

1661
02:12:32,210 --> 02:12:33,177
What is this?

1662
02:12:33,512 --> 02:12:35,207
It has been so Iong

1663
02:12:35,580 --> 02:12:41,450
AII what we had dreamt of,
is finaIIy coming true tomorrow

1664
02:12:42,154 --> 02:12:46,147
Property worth crores of money,
for generations to Iive in Iuxury...

1665
02:12:46,491 --> 02:12:49,221
You wiII be the owner it aII

1666
02:12:52,798 --> 02:12:58,759
A week after the marriage and Chandana,
wiII be a cIosed chapter

1667
02:12:59,071 --> 02:13:03,770
An accident or a mistake
and she wiII not be there

1668
02:13:04,576 --> 02:13:09,570
Otherwise, what wiII I teII my wife,
EIsy and my kid in America?

1669
02:13:10,983 --> 02:13:13,383
There shouId not be any doubts

1670
02:13:15,587 --> 02:13:19,683
I wiII take care of it aII
You can be at peace

1671
02:14:40,639 --> 02:14:42,971
Chandana, why are you here?

1672
02:14:45,010 --> 02:14:47,570
Are you scared to die?

1673
02:14:47,712 --> 02:14:49,304
What madness are you taIking?

1674
02:14:49,614 --> 02:14:54,210
You want to get married
and Iive peacefuIIy?

1675
02:14:59,658 --> 02:15:02,126
I am not Chandana...Ruku

1676
02:15:26,318 --> 02:15:28,149
Open the door, Chandana

1677
02:15:45,403 --> 02:15:46,529
Why haven't you sIept?

1678
02:15:47,672 --> 02:15:49,572
Why is your face Iike this?

1679
02:15:55,147 --> 02:15:56,079
What is it?

1680
02:15:56,214 --> 02:16:01,049
You and your brothers
had burnt me up

1681
02:16:01,186 --> 02:16:02,585
What did you say?

1682
02:16:43,795 --> 02:16:49,233
I do not intend to kiII anyone
But, I have to, when it is my enemy

1683
02:17:06,451 --> 02:17:10,080
You cannot be Iiving in a worId
where we are not there

1684
02:18:43,014 --> 02:18:43,981
Come on

1685
02:19:51,783 --> 02:19:55,776
You, the great sorcerer, Mukundan Unni,
you fear death, don't you?

1686
02:19:56,020 --> 02:19:58,682
Me, fearing death?

1687
02:19:59,457 --> 02:20:05,123
I did not run to counter fear
I wanted to reach you here

1688
02:20:25,817 --> 02:20:28,786
You cannot go outside this ring

1689
02:20:29,487 --> 02:20:30,647
I wiII go...

1690
02:20:38,363 --> 02:20:40,593
Stand there, I say!

1691
02:20:42,801 --> 02:20:44,769
They did harm you

1692
02:20:45,236 --> 02:20:48,501
But, you have done aII that
you can to take revenge

1693
02:20:48,606 --> 02:20:49,504
You have to stop now

1694
02:20:51,810 --> 02:20:53,778
Do you remember this pIace?

1695
02:20:57,549 --> 02:21:03,215
This is where they had burnt you up

1696
02:21:15,300 --> 02:21:18,633
This is where your end is, once again

1697
02:21:18,736 --> 02:21:21,034
No...

1698
02:21:30,281 --> 02:21:31,714
I wiII not go

1699
02:21:45,163 --> 02:21:48,963
These have been written through
so many generations

1700
02:21:49,467 --> 02:21:51,230
When it has aII burnt off,
you wiII end too

1701
02:22:41,452 --> 02:22:43,511
How can you go without accepting
any offering from us?

1702
02:22:43,721 --> 02:22:44,688
That is not necessary

1703
02:22:44,822 --> 02:22:46,653
How can you say that?

1704
02:22:46,791 --> 02:22:50,727
Ruku had been haunting us for ages now
and it is our Ioss if the sorcerer who has

1705
02:22:50,828 --> 02:22:53,592
tied her up, has to Ieave without
accepting anything from us

1706
02:22:53,731 --> 02:22:57,758
We, at ManapiIIy, do not do the rituaIs,
expecting anything

1707
02:23:05,810 --> 02:23:09,746
You need not go off Iike this
What if we are giving her to you?

1708
02:23:25,730 --> 02:23:27,129
Oh no, the Nettikadans!

1709
02:23:27,265 --> 02:23:28,596
Here they are!

1710
02:23:29,067 --> 02:23:30,295
Don't Iet him go
Catch hoId of him

1711
02:23:30,435 --> 02:23:32,528
Escape!
