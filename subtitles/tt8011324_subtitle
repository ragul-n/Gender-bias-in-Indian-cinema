1
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,750
(Lava Kusa.)

2
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:01,450
Brother! Without my knowledge,
I am consumed by sorrow.

3
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:03,120
I don't know the reason.

4
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,580
When I see this King,

5
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:06,000
who has come for war,

6
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,910
mourn over the death of his brother,

7
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:09,160
I feel miserable.

8
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,120
The pain we feel,

9
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,750
when we see sorrow
in our mother's face,

10
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:13,450
that's exactly how I am feeling,

11
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,370
seeing the misery
on this King's face.

12
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:16,660
To be precise,

13
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:18,250
I feel more affectionate
towards this King,

14
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:21,040
than the affection I feel
towards our mother.

15
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,250
No matter, how much
I mentally prepare myself,

16
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:24,910
I don't have the
courage to wage war,

17
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:25,910
against this King.

18
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:27,540
My hands are unable
to shoot the arrow.

19
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:30,290
What do we do about
this miserable condition?

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,330
(Kovalan's Story.)
I have killed, Pandian, Vanjipithan,
and the evil minister,

21
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:43,040
those who killed my husband,

22
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,910
just as my heart desired.

23
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:46,950
Apart from those,
elders of Madurai,

24
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,290
residing in the town,
who are fair,

25
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:51,120
pure women, the children,

26
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,500
the learned and disciplined
honourable people,

27
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:55,500
the birds and the animals,

28
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:57,790
let the rest burn to ashes!!!

29
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:25,450
My dear, my life, my love!

30
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,950
Once you go there,

31
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,790
(Satyavan Savitri.)
because of your father or mother,

32
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:31,000
(Satyavan Savitri.)
or because of any
other important reason,

33
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,370
if you forget me,

34
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:34,750
will it be possible for me
to stay alive?

35
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:36,160
It won't be isn't it?

36
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,080
If you're fine with me dying,

37
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,660
then you go there.

38
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,620
My crooning temple pigeon,

39
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:47,950
my gem,

40
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,660
please don't suspect me.

41
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:53,000
I will go there as fast as possible,

42
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,870
meet my mother and father,

43
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:57,580
pay my respects and
come back to you soon.

44
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:59,540
This is a promise.

45
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:01,410
Please let me go.

46
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:04,200
My Savitiri, please let me go.

47
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:28,040
So many people are coming, Aadhimoolam.

48
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,080
Why don't you act in films?

49
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:32,160
As long as I can,

50
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,700
I wish to perform directly
in front of the audience.

51
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:37,540
Appreciation or criticism,
you get it immediately.

52
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:39,160
Not just that,

53
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,870
I am content, here.

54
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:45,790
(Interrogation.)
In the salary that has
been given to you,

55
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:48,410
(Interrogation.)
you have fed others and
also have given money.

56
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:50,160
From the salary I receive,

57
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,950
I can feed whoever I want,

58
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I can give money to whoever I want.

59
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,540
I think no one has the right,

60
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:56,580
to question me.

61
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,080
Not even for the government?

62
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,290
The money you're receiving,

63
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:00,580
belongs to the government.

64
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:02,500
What I receive is my salary.

65
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:04,040
Those who you are helping,

66
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,700
are people, who the
government dislikes.

67
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:09,080
Let it be. Those seem
to be the people I like.

68
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,450
Not just that,

69
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,160
they are not unlawful people.

70
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:15,910
They are part of a legit movement.

71
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:16,500
Let it be...

72
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:17,540
They are my friends!

73
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:21,500
Could be, but you can't favour them.

74
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,870
A government employee,

75
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:28,580
should only favour, those
who the government likes.

76
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:31,160
Those who the government dislikes,

77
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,950
he should also dislike!

78
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,660
Please explain in a way
I can understand.

79
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,500
I am saying, that the
citizens of a country,

80
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:42,200
shouldn't function against
their government!

81
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:44,080
So you are saying...

82
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:47,160
So you are saying,
we should be slaves.

83
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:48,200
Not possible!

84
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:49,700
We can't accept this!

85
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,410
The government should
function for me,

86
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:54,370
for you, and for the people,

87
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:55,290
and not,

88
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:56,830
us functioning for the government!

89
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:57,830
Am I right?

90
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:09,450
(SEETHAKAATHI)

91
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:21,910
The final stages of Aurangzeb's life, he who had considered
all art forms unnecessary, had banned them during his regime.

92
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:33,410
(Aurangzeb)

93
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:12,120
Who is there?

94
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,790
Come and play it, in front of me!

95
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:18,830
I will bury you and your music!

96
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:43,250
Abul Muzaffar Muhy-ud-Din Muhammad
Aurangzeb Bahadur Alamgir, Badshah Ghazi!

97
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:49,330
Soldiers! Soldiers!

98
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:52,370
No one will come Alamgir!

99
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:54,620
No use, calling them.

100
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,830
Who are you?

101
00:06:57,410 --> 00:06:59,830
I was right there in front of you,

102
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:01,410
during your childhood,

103
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:04,950
I was always playing
at your ear's distance.

104
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:07,370
You chased me away!

105
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:10,580
Now I stand alone, grieving.

106
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,160
Music!

107
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,660
Music!

108
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:50,750
You, who are existing as a voice,

109
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,410
take, form and appear.

110
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,370
I need to talk to you.

111
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:33,040
Why are you laughing?

112
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:37,950
When you approached me
with the sword,

113
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,620
I thought you were
again trying to kill me.

114
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:44,870
A sword just to lift a veil!

115
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:49,120
Looking at your savage taste,
how can I not laugh!

116
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,290
Who are you?

117
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:51,700
Tell the truth!

118
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,080
Why?

119
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:55,700
Are you doubting whether,

120
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:59,910
music can be present at the core of your soul?

121
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:04,250
Just a while ago, you were mesmerized
listening to the music.

122
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:05,790
Why is that?

123
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:10,750
You can't be without listening
to my voice anymore.

124
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,120
If you have to kill me...

125
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,290
If I have to...

126
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:16,620
Why did you stop, say it!

127
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,200
You will have to commit suicide Badshah!

128
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:26,410
How dare you have the guts,
to talk about suicide to a true Muslim.

129
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,160
True Muslim!

130
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:32,330
True Muslim, is what you keep saying often.

131
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:37,580
Badshah, do you keep doubting that?

132
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:42,040
I have no doubts at all about that.

133
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:55,450
I live exactly the way, The Quran
states a Muslim should!

134
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:58,910
I am a true Muslim!

135
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:02,500
I have no doubts about that!

136
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:06,750
Those who had called themselves
Muslims, but disgraced Islam,

137
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:08,000
I have killed them!

138
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,370
Tara!

139
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:13,250
His father's beloved Tara!

140
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:18,580
He tried hard for Tara to be
crowned and me to be hung!

141
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,790
But...

142
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:25,870
But Tara's head was hung
in the middle of the road!

143
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:35,580
A fool who never accepted what he said
or did was wrong, till the very end.

144
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:45,500
I don't know what love is!

145
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:51,080
No one taught me about it either.

146
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:55,000
You just keep repeating this chant,

147
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,200
in this vast kingdom,

148
00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:03,950
with no companion, standing alone,
experiencing sorrow my dear Emperor!

149
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:11,500
Loneliness... Loneliness... Loneliness!

150
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,660
Yes it is true.

151
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:20,330
I have no companion. Yes it is true.
That I trust no one. That is also true.

152
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:24,330
My own son is my enemy and
my darling daughter his ally.

153
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:25,580
That is also true!

154
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,540
My loneliness!

155
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:30,200
Now you understand?

156
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:33,160
This is what Shah Jahan
would also have said.

157
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,750
I did not hate my son like the way
my father hated me!

158
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:42,160
When that's the case,
why has he become my enemy?

159
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:49,080
I dreamt of, One Nation, One religion, One language,
for the good of everyone.

160
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:53,120
Everything failed.

161
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:59,200
Like you said, I am experiencing loneliness.

162
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,870
From the top of my reign, I look down.

163
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:09,410
All I see is just emptiness!

164
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,700
You find what I am saying, funny?

165
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:17,750
From the top of my reign, I look down.

166
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,910
All I see is just emptiness!

167
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:25,870
Wow! What beautiful poetry!

168
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:30,620
Like music another enemy of yours is poetry.

169
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:33,290
From the way you're talking,
it seems like,

170
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:36,120
she too is on her way here!

171
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:39,200
Why you trying to confuse me?

172
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,330
Please, leave... leave...

173
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,120
Leave...

174
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:04,580
The One who possesses, empathy and sympathy.
The Almighty Allah!

175
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:09,120
The One who rules this universe!
All the praise belongs to you!

176
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:15,000
On judgement day, The Almighty
who pronounces justice!

177
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,290
Show us the path of righteousness.

178
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:23,160
When I came, I came empty handed.

179
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:30,500
As I leave, I carry a
heavy baggage of sin!

180
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:39,160
To wash away the blood
stains on my hands,

181
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,910
the water flowing through the entire
Yamuna river, won't be enough.

182
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:46,080
Definitely it won't be enough!

183
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:50,330
Who, is the reason for all this?

184
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,870
Am I a religious fanatic?

185
00:14:56,410 --> 00:14:58,500
Is it the greed for power?

186
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:03,790
Or am I an orphan yearning for love?

187
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:07,410
I am confused...

188
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:13,370
Apart from you, I have no one.

189
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:23,750
What motivated me
to commit so many murders?

190
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:26,120
What?

191
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:34,040
It is not my responsibility
to analyze reasons.

192
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:38,910
History, will have to tell!

193
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:44,540
Incidents are appearing before my eyes.

194
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:54,000
I am a tired old man.

195
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:02,330
I, myself, have become history now!!!

196
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:06,500
Aurangzeb.

197
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:17,910
Ayya.

198
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:19,750
You did well! Bless you!

199
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:20,500
Thanks Ayya.

200
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,620
Bless you!

201
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:23,700
Bless you!

202
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:26,040
Bless you!

203
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:28,620
Bless you!

204
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:44,910
You performed really well Mohana.

205
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:49,700
- Thanks. Is your son coming to pick you up?
- No.
- Then let's leave together.

206
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:53,040
The play is over,
what are you still doing?

207
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,370
Ayya.

208
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,410
It was brilliant.

209
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:51,290
If it continues like this, finally
you will be the only one watching .

210
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:55,250
This won't be enough,
even to pay the auditorium rent.

211
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:58,120
What's the point in being brilliant?

212
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,660
Nothing like that,

213
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,580
definitely more people will come.

214
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:07,580
Just that, in today's times,
we need to advertise.

215
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:09,700
To reach the people.

216
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Like there are film advertisements
in the newspapers.

217
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:19,040
Why don't we also advertise
our plays in a big way?

218
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:23,660
No... no... don't worry about the money,

219
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:27,250
Kannan, working at the newspaper,
said he will take care of it.

220
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:30,750
Once the situation gets better
we can return it.

221
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:32,000
He only suggested it.

222
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:55,040
Okay, go ahead.

223
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:02,120
All of you performed well.

224
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,160
Thank you Ayya!!!

225
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,500
Bless you!

226
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:06,830
Ranga.

227
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:07,370
Ayya.

228
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:09,700
Lakshmi said she saw you on TV.

229
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:12,450
I just went for a day Ayya.

230
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:14,160
I was not comfortable.

231
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:15,830
Why?

232
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:18,160
After being like a king here...

233
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,290
There... I just couldn't do it.

234
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:22,160
Ayya, he only took me there.

235
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:28,120
Oh you! Sit down.

236
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,700
It's okay Ayya, I will stand,

237
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:32,830
If you keep standing,
my neck will pain. Sit down.

238
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,910
Will you perform well
on stage tomorrow?

239
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:41,950
I will do it, exactly the way
you have taught me.

240
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:45,410
If you're going to do only what
I taught you, why are you required...

241
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:46,450
You should be individualistic.

242
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,290
Where is Mohana?

243
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:51,200
Ayya.

244
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:54,750
Have they fixed the date?

245
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,250
No Ayya. That didn't work out.

246
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,200
Why?

247
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:03,370
They wanted me to stop
acting after the marriage.

248
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:05,620
So I said no.

249
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,910
Did the family members
ask you or the groom?

250
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:10,410
The family members.

251
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:14,540
You talk to the groom
once and then decide.

252
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:15,620
Okay, Ayya.

253
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:21,000
Okay let's meet tomorrow.

254
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:22,910
Okay, Ayya. Thank you.

255
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:36,580
- Gopal, shall we leave.
- Okay.

256
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:17,200
See you, Gopal.

257
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:24,410
Puneetha.

258
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:25,410
Dad.

259
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,620
When did you come?

260
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:29,200
In the afternoon dad.

261
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,500
Why you washing clothes at this hour?

262
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:35,540
Got a little late, dad.

263
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,660
Has your husband come?

264
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:40,200
He hasn't come, dad.

265
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:47,330
Why you looking dull?

266
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:48,870
Nothing, dad.

267
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:52,410
Has my darling come?

268
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:53,910
He is inside.

269
00:24:58,870 --> 00:24:59,830
Tarun.

270
00:25:00,370 --> 00:25:01,580
Grandpa!

271
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:02,500
My darling!

272
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:05,330
Lakshmi, give me some water.

273
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,200
Come to me, my darling.

274
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:13,910
Come to me, my darling.

275
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:29,660
You came in the afternoon itself?

276
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:33,080
Why, did you not go to
school today?

277
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:34,330
Why?

278
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:36,830
I went to the hospital.

279
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:38,830
Hospital?

280
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:40,580
Why?

281
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:44,500
I had another attack this morning.

282
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:47,330
That's why mum and me came here.

283
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:50,500
They are going to do an operation.

284
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:59,080
Have you eaten?

285
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,160
Puneetha.

286
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,120
Dad.

287
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:38,080
Did he have fits again this morning?

288
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:39,580
Yes.

289
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,910
No... no... your eyes will hurt.

290
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:46,450
What did the doctor say?

291
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,370
They took a scan.

292
00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:50,330
There is a lump in his brain.

293
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:52,200
They said it has to be operated.

294
00:26:58,450 --> 00:26:59,120
Okay.

295
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:04,000
Don't worry.

296
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:07,660
Nowadays all this is not complicated.

297
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:11,950
Shall we consult another doctor?

298
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,080
No dad.

299
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,330
He is the specialist, in Chennai.

300
00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:18,620
He said, earlier it's done the better.

301
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:30,410
Okay.

302
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,910
Okay, let me talk to
your husband.

303
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:35,750
He has also asked
for a loan at office.

304
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:38,620
It will cost around 4 to 5 lakhs.

305
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:42,000
I don't how I am going to arrange
for the balance amount.

306
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,450
Okay.

307
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:54,540
The doctor said everything
will be fine, right?

308
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:00,750
Lakshmi.

309
00:28:01,330 --> 00:28:04,580
So much has happened,
why didn't you inform me?

310
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:07,040
She came only in the afternoon.

311
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:09,410
At that time you will
be in the auditorium,

312
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:11,830
did not want to come
there and call you.

313
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:15,200
Have I told you not to call me?

314
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:17,290
Not just that,

315
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:21,750
we were asking a few
people, for the money.

316
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:25,500
That's why I forgot.

317
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:33,540
You go change your clothes,
and come to eat, your dinner is ready.

318
00:32:19,010 --> 00:32:19,800
Mani.

319
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:22,050
Ayya.

320
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:25,350
- Is your health better?
- It is better.

321
00:32:26,930 --> 00:32:33,300
- If not, shall I ask Mohan to play your part?
- No need Ayya. I will act.

322
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:41,800
- Everything's ready?
- Everything is ready Ayya.

323
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:49,100
What...

324
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:53,350
After the advertisement, about ten
more people would have come?

325
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:58,850
That's not wrong,

326
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,180
lets go.

327
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:08,140
Sujatha's "Unjal".
Directed by Ayya. Aadhimoolam.

328
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:11,640
Why you talking about
postponing the wedding?

329
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:15,260
- Are you playing the fool?
- Yes, Giri, we have to postpone our wedding.

330
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:17,430
By how many days?
Shall we keep it next week?

331
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:20,470
Days... Months... why,
it could even take years.

332
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:24,300
I agree, that yesterday my mum
just sat like Ho Chi Minh!

333
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:26,930
But that doesn't mean she is not
interested in the wedding, Kalyani!

334
00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:30,010
- Giri, your mother is not the reason.
- Then?

335
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:34,600
My father wishes to conduct the wedding in an
ideal manner, bearing the expenses on his own.

336
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:37,800
Don't mistake me, something's
wrong with that old man.

337
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:38,600
Giri!

338
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:42,600
All of you will never
understand my father.

339
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,100
You haven't left as yet?

340
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:45,100
Welcome Giri.

341
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:46,260
When did you come?

342
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:47,970
I came five minutes back.

343
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:50,010
She's talking about postponing
the wedding, ask her?

344
00:33:50,050 --> 00:33:51,390
She never told me anything.

345
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:53,470
- I decided only at night, mom.
- About what?

346
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:56,800
First, let dad finish the
prototype, only after that.

347
00:33:56,850 --> 00:33:57,800
Money?

348
00:33:57,970 --> 00:33:59,640
I am going to give the money.

349
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,430
Which I saved for the wedding.

350
00:34:01,470 --> 00:34:03,220
I think you're making a mistake .

351
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:04,970
I am not making a mistake,

352
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:07,300
If you can't wait, tell me.

353
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:08,220
Tell me now.

354
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,390
You please wait.

355
00:34:09,430 --> 00:34:12,640
This looks like something new is happening
between father and daughter.

356
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:13,930
Let him come,
we can ask him.

357
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:18,470
I will leave and come later.

358
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:19,350
Giri.

359
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:22,260
Listen to this and then leave.

360
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:24,550
Kalyani.

361
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:26,300
You also listen to this.

362
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:32,050
Tell your mother that she can cry later,

363
00:34:32,930 --> 00:34:35,390
and to now listen to this carefully.

364
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:42,600
I decided last night itself.

365
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:47,180
To take up the job
offered by Mathivathanam.

366
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:49,390
- Dad!
- Don't interrupt!

367
00:34:55,470 --> 00:35:01,470
I asked you for money, but did
you think I would take it?

368
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:04,890
No...

369
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:11,050
I asked...

370
00:35:12,850 --> 00:35:16,510
Just to see, how much trust you have in me.

371
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:20,050
But you,

372
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:22,760
the minute I asked,
you immediately said,

373
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:27,260
that you would withdraw the money,

374
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:30,220
you had saved for your wedding,

375
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:33,050
and give it to me tomorrow.

376
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:36,100
That's when you proved,

377
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:38,180
you're my daughter.

378
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:52,850
Instead of dismissing me
as an useless old man,

379
00:35:56,350 --> 00:35:58,930
you trusted me,

380
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:01,470
that's enough!

381
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:08,760
I don't have to prove
anything to anyone.

382
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:16,890
If there is one soul who believes in me,

383
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:20,260
that's enough.

384
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,470
Dad, that's alright dad.

385
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:25,300
I will get the money and come,

386
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:27,510
you attempt it once more, dad.

387
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:34,010
Dad!

388
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:42,470
Ayya.

389
00:36:48,890 --> 00:36:50,010
Ayya.

390
00:37:17,350 --> 00:37:21,970
" Oh! Ayya! What are you gazing at?"

391
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:26,010
" For so long!!! "

392
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:29,140
" Is your entire life,"

393
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:31,220
" like dry leaves,"

394
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:35,720
" falling down?"

395
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:39,720
" All that love,"

396
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:44,180
" and those years of yearning..."

397
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:47,050
" In a flash of a second..."

398
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:49,350
" Like a dewdrop,"

399
00:37:49,390 --> 00:37:50,890
" alone..."

400
00:37:50,930 --> 00:37:53,350
" Has it dried up?"

401
00:37:53,470 --> 00:37:57,850
" On the rock, the Brightest light,"

402
00:37:57,890 --> 00:38:02,140
" lingers on and goes away."

403
00:38:02,350 --> 00:38:04,140
" All the sacrifices..."

404
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:06,680
" Bow down,"

405
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:11,510
" and cry in silence!"

406
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:16,220
" Life doesn't end with death..."

407
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:20,890
Ayya...Ayya...Ayya...

408
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:58,260
" Once the mirage,"

409
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:02,850
" is what you get used to as real."

410
00:39:02,890 --> 00:39:04,850
" Then..."

411
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:08,140
" When a crystal clear river,"

412
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:11,390
" touches, you won't feel it."

413
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:13,510
" Within."

414
00:39:13,890 --> 00:39:18,390
" The silence that has seen,
the depth of depths..."

415
00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:22,600
" Can sound win it over?"

416
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:25,010
" Till the end of time..."

417
00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:27,180
" A tree has its roots spread..."

418
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:30,180
" Can it fall apart in death?"

419
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:34,930
" In solitude you wept."

420
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:37,100
" Where did you leave!!! "

421
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:39,550
" Oh! King!!! "

422
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,470
" As the makeup,"

423
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:43,930
" wore off..."

424
00:39:43,970 --> 00:39:48,430
" You became your own face is it?"

425
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:53,600
" Art never respects death!!! "

426
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:59,390
" The solitary reaper has fallen..."

427
00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:03,720
" On the bed of fire,"

428
00:40:03,930 --> 00:40:06,850
" burning to ashes,"

429
00:40:06,890 --> 00:40:09,550
" in solitude."

430
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:14,470
" Is this the end?"

431
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:50,350
You're listening to Munna!
There is one happy and one sad news!

432
00:40:50,390 --> 00:40:52,800
First let me tell you
the sad news.

433
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:55,720
Theatre actor Aadhimoolam
passed away a while ago.

434
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,720
Don't ask me
who is Aadhimoolam...

435
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:01,850
Next... famous actor Surenkumar is going to
reveal his new film's title tonight at 12am.

436
00:41:01,890 --> 00:41:05,100
"Legendary theatre actor
Aadhimoolam, passed away today."

437
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:07,100
"He was 73 years old."

438
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:10,550
"He breathed his last as he
was performing on stage."

439
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:15,470
"His demise is an irreplaceable loss, for the
arts community and the world of theatre,"

440
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:17,720
"said the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu."

441
00:41:55,180 --> 00:42:00,600
One month later...

442
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,600
Through many difficulties,

443
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:05,350
and no matter what,

444
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:09,300
for more than fifty years, Ayya continuously
staged plays in this auditorium.

445
00:42:09,390 --> 00:42:11,430
After his demise,

446
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,680
to just abandon it,

447
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:16,220
is troubling my conscience.

448
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:19,600
Even if we aren't able to
stage plays regularly,

449
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:23,100
we should stage them
occasionally, that's my wish.

450
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:24,890
Ayya would have wished the same.

451
00:42:24,930 --> 00:42:25,850
Definitely.

452
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:29,680
After Ayya's demise,
us not performing on stage,

453
00:42:30,010 --> 00:42:32,640
feels like, we have lost everything.

454
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:34,050
I am going for a job.

455
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:36,510
Yes, money is important, but...

456
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:39,140
I am not able to be without this.

457
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:40,390
Why occasionally...

458
00:42:40,430 --> 00:42:41,930
Let's stage continuously.

459
00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:45,890
We were wondering, how to
approach this topic with you.

460
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:48,220
Thankfully, you called us.

461
00:42:49,510 --> 00:42:52,680
Okay, then shall we stage
the plays this weekend?

462
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,180
Yes let's do it!

463
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:57,350
Let's start the rehearsals from tomorrow.

464
00:42:57,430 --> 00:42:58,600
Okay.

465
00:43:05,930 --> 00:43:06,970
Bheema!

466
00:43:07,510 --> 00:43:10,010
Are you saying this with a conscience?

467
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:11,600
What are you talking?

468
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,640
Where... and in front of whom!

469
00:43:13,970 --> 00:43:15,930
Your burning rage... has...

470
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:21,850
"Has burnt your brains, hence you talk to the King of the
three worlds, your brother, with such anger!"

471
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:25,600
Has burnt your brains, hence you talk
to the King of the three worlds...

472
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:29,260
Hence you talk to the King of the three
worlds, your brother, with such anger!

473
00:43:29,350 --> 00:43:33,720
Come Paanjaali, come sit on my thigh!

474
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:36,300
She is the one who has
married five of them!

475
00:43:36,350 --> 00:43:38,550
Where is the aide?
Come here?

476
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:41,510
Remove, the clothes of the Pandavas,

477
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:44,100
and also remove her saree!

478
00:43:44,930 --> 00:43:51,220
Oh! Lord Kanna! Oh! Lord Kanna!
Save me! Save me!

479
00:43:57,100 --> 00:43:59,140
I promise on the Gods in the skies!

480
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:00,930
I promise on Goddess Parasakthi!

481
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:03,800
I promise, this is what I am going to do.

482
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:05,890
This impotent Duryodhanan,

483
00:44:05,930 --> 00:44:11,930
who dared, to ask, our beloved
Paanjaali, who is equal to fire,

484
00:44:11,970 --> 00:44:16,010
shamelessly to come
and sit on his thigh.

485
00:44:16,050 --> 00:44:18,390
This Duryodhanan,

486
00:44:18,890 --> 00:44:21,720
in front of all these
disgraceful ministers,

487
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:23,890
I will, with all my strength,

488
00:44:23,930 --> 00:44:26,260
I will split his thighs and kill him!!!

489
00:44:26,970 --> 00:44:31,470
I will rip apart, his disgusting brother
Dushasanan's, shoulders!

490
00:44:31,510 --> 00:44:36,050
I will drink the blood
that oozes from there.

491
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:38,470
This is definitely going to happen!

492
00:44:38,510 --> 00:44:42,850
These are not words spoken by me.
These are Goddess Parasakthi's words!

493
00:44:42,890 --> 00:44:46,100
This will be carried and blessed by
the Goddess Parasakthi herself!

494
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:48,850
This hateful Karnan, I will at war...

495
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:57,890
Ranga, you were superb!

496
00:45:01,010 --> 00:45:03,640
Brother, saw how Rangan performed?

497
00:45:08,430 --> 00:45:10,100
- Ranga.
- Brother.

498
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:12,300
Brilliant! Superb! Superb!

499
00:45:12,430 --> 00:45:15,470
You should have performed
like this, when Ayya was there.

500
00:45:15,510 --> 00:45:17,140
He would have been so happy.

501
00:45:17,470 --> 00:45:20,260
Okay, this is enough for today.

502
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:24,350
Tomorrow, let's do a complete
dress rehearsal, before the show.

503
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:28,350
After he has lost, he has no right to lose me!

504
00:46:30,010 --> 00:46:37,680
After losing at a game of dice,
on what grounds has he pledged me?

505
00:46:40,010 --> 00:46:43,300
From now I am Drupadan's daughter.

506
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:46,760
You, who have lost at gambling,

507
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:50,850
do you still have the right
to call me your wife?

508
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:57,680
Is there no one here who is righteous?

509
00:46:59,470 --> 00:47:01,800
Even before the truth was found,

510
00:47:01,890 --> 00:47:04,470
is justice dead?

511
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:07,550
Is justice dead?

512
00:47:08,510 --> 00:47:11,050
In gambling houses,

513
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:15,390
there will be servant maids.

514
00:47:16,350 --> 00:47:21,220
No one will ever pledge them and gamble.

515
00:47:22,850 --> 00:47:26,640
Brother! what were you thinking?

516
00:47:27,390 --> 00:47:29,510
Who have you pledged!

517
00:47:29,890 --> 00:47:34,220
Oh! Lord Kanna! Save me!

518
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:36,930
Almighty! Save me!

519
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:39,430
Oh! Lord Kanna!

520
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:45,680
Oh! Lord Kanna! Save me!
Save me!

521
00:47:46,010 --> 00:47:47,390
Oh! Lord Kanna!!!

522
00:47:48,390 --> 00:47:50,850
Save me! Save me!
Oh! Lord Kanna!

523
00:47:51,470 --> 00:47:54,850
Oh! Lord Kanna!!!

524
00:47:57,930 --> 00:48:02,180
Save me! Save me!

525
00:48:09,140 --> 00:48:13,220
I promise on Goddess Parasakthi!

526
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:17,220
That, the blood of Dushasanan,

527
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:21,010
and the blood from Duryodanan's thigh,

528
00:48:21,390 --> 00:48:24,260
I will mix them both,

529
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:27,010
and apply it on my hair!

530
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:31,680
Only after I wash it off with aromatic oils,

531
00:48:32,010 --> 00:48:34,140
will I tie my hair!

532
00:48:34,510 --> 00:48:36,600
Till then I won't!

533
00:48:37,010 --> 00:48:38,680
This is a promise!!!

534
00:48:46,220 --> 00:48:51,010
Mohana this is the first time
I have seen you act so well!

535
00:48:51,140 --> 00:48:55,260
You were even better than, Rangan's
performance of yesterday.

536
00:49:01,390 --> 00:49:10,390
Bharathiyar's 'Paanjaali Sabatham'. (A Mythological play)
Directed by Ayya.Aadhimoolam.

537
00:49:16,890 --> 00:49:20,970
Drupadan's daughter, and
Dhrishtadyumnan's sister,

538
00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:23,100
how can she be equated
to the roll of the dice!

539
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:25,760
This is Cruelty! Cruelty!!!

540
00:49:26,970 --> 00:49:30,390
You have given her away
as a slave to them!

541
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:32,470
You have given her away!

542
00:49:32,510 --> 00:49:34,470
Go and get,

543
00:49:34,510 --> 00:49:37,220
a torch burning in flames.

544
00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:41,930
For pledging our fire, in gambling,
let us burn our brother's hands!

545
00:49:41,970 --> 00:49:43,140
Bheema!

546
00:49:43,350 --> 00:49:45,970
Are you saying this with a conscience?

547
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:47,930
What are you talking?

548
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:50,850
Where... and in front of whom!

549
00:49:50,890 --> 00:49:53,800
Your burning rage, has burnt
your brains, hence you talk,

550
00:49:53,850 --> 00:49:57,600
to the King of the three worlds,
your brother, with such anger!

551
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:00,640
Actions are going on and on,
and we are watching,

552
00:50:00,890 --> 00:50:02,510
because we are tied today.

553
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:04,260
Let's be patient.

554
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:05,930
Time will definitely change.

555
00:50:06,010 --> 00:50:09,050
Then the world will witness
justice being victorious!!!

556
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:12,300
My hands hold the bow, brother!

557
00:50:12,550 --> 00:50:15,050
It's called the Kandeepam!

558
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:22,850
On the battlefield,
with all my strength,

559
00:50:22,930 --> 00:50:25,600
I will split his thighs and kill him!!!

560
00:50:26,470 --> 00:50:30,390
I will rip apart, his disgusting
brother Dushasanan's, shoulders!

561
00:50:30,430 --> 00:50:32,350
This is definitely going to happen!

562
00:50:32,390 --> 00:50:34,550
Oh! World, you are going to witness it!

563
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:36,550
These are not words
spoken by me.

564
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:38,720
These are Goddess
Parasakthi's words!

565
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:41,260
This will be carried and blessed by
the Goddess Parasakthi herself!

566
00:50:41,470 --> 00:50:44,640
I will kill this hateful Karnan at war!!!

567
00:50:44,930 --> 00:50:47,970
I promise on Lord Kanna's holy feet!!!

568
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:50,260
I promise on my lady's eyes,

569
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:53,350
and I promise on my bow, Kandeepam.

570
00:50:53,390 --> 00:50:57,140
Oh! You earthly World!
At the call of war!!!

571
00:50:57,180 --> 00:51:01,140
You are definitely going to witness,
my extraordinary combat skills!!!

572
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:34,180
Puneetha.

573
00:52:35,930 --> 00:52:37,890
Come inside for a minute.

574
00:52:57,930 --> 00:52:59,890
Ayya has not left us.

575
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:01,680
He is here with us.

576
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:09,510
Yesterday he came through Rangan.

577
00:53:10,470 --> 00:53:12,600
Then through Mohana.

578
00:53:13,220 --> 00:53:14,300
And now,

579
00:53:15,470 --> 00:53:18,300
you saw Arjunan's portrayal right?

580
00:53:19,430 --> 00:53:21,930
That's no one else, but our Ayya!!!

581
00:53:24,470 --> 00:53:26,550
What are you saying?

582
00:53:29,100 --> 00:53:31,720
Fifty years, he has lived on this stage.

583
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:33,850
Will he just go away like that!

584
00:53:35,970 --> 00:53:38,100
He has not gone away from us.

585
00:53:38,140 --> 00:53:39,800
His soul is still here.

586
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:45,100
He is still acting through someone.

587
00:53:46,220 --> 00:53:48,970
I am noticing that,
for the past two days.

588
00:53:51,430 --> 00:53:55,350
For my sake, watch the play once more.

589
00:53:55,390 --> 00:53:56,760
Then you will understand.

590
00:54:06,390 --> 00:54:07,100
Who's that?

591
00:54:07,970 --> 00:54:11,430
A film director has come,
he wants to meet you.

592
00:54:11,890 --> 00:54:12,970
I'm coming.

593
00:54:15,260 --> 00:54:17,930
Just a minute, I will be back.

594
00:54:19,350 --> 00:54:20,100
Hello sir.

595
00:54:20,140 --> 00:54:20,680
Hello.

596
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:22,760
- My name is Thyagu.
- Tell me sir.

597
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:25,470
I am looking out for a hero,
for my next film.

598
00:54:25,510 --> 00:54:27,300
I saw your play today.

599
00:54:27,350 --> 00:54:29,180
The actor who played Arjun's Character,

600
00:54:29,260 --> 00:54:30,720
was fantastic.

601
00:54:33,930 --> 00:54:36,100
He will be perfect for my story.

602
00:54:38,140 --> 00:54:41,100
I spoke to him, he asked
me to talk to you.

603
00:54:43,050 --> 00:54:44,890
Just give us a minute.

604
00:54:51,550 --> 00:54:54,800
Sir, is this the first time
you're watching this play?

605
00:54:54,850 --> 00:54:55,970
Yes sir.

606
00:54:57,180 --> 00:54:58,890
Can you do a small favour?

607
00:54:59,260 --> 00:55:00,100
Tell me sir.

608
00:55:01,390 --> 00:55:05,140
For my sake, just watch the play
once more and then decide.

609
00:55:05,220 --> 00:55:06,390
Once more...?

610
00:55:06,430 --> 00:55:07,430
There's a reason for it.

611
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:10,760
Okay sir.

612
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:16,730
Directed by Ayya.Aadhimoolam.

613
00:55:17,270 --> 00:55:21,270
On stage, Ambi.Raghavan as Dharman,

614
00:55:21,310 --> 00:55:23,440
Ranga as Bheeman,

615
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:25,900
Saravanan as Arjunan,

616
00:55:25,940 --> 00:55:31,020
Mohana as Paanjaali and Vignesh as Vigarnan.

617
00:55:40,770 --> 00:55:42,350
Is it fate, my husband!

618
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:46,520
Following every ritual, and the
sacred fire being a witness,

619
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:48,650
you, willingly wedded me.

620
00:55:48,690 --> 00:55:54,190
To see me get destroyed
by these rogues is it?

621
00:55:54,650 --> 00:55:57,230
In spite of such learned men,

622
00:55:57,270 --> 00:55:58,850
being in the court...

623
00:55:59,060 --> 00:56:00,850
Go and get,

624
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:03,230
a torch burning in flames,

625
00:56:03,270 --> 00:56:09,020
for pledging our fire, in gambling,
let us burn our brother's hands!

626
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:10,690
burn our brother's hands!

627
00:56:10,730 --> 00:56:12,350
Bheema!

628
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:14,690
Are you saying this with a conscience?

629
00:56:15,150 --> 00:56:16,730
What are you talking?

630
00:56:16,770 --> 00:56:18,690
Where... and in front of whom!

631
00:56:19,190 --> 00:56:21,940
Your burning rage, has burnt
your brains, hence you talk,

632
00:56:21,980 --> 00:56:25,900
to the King of the three worlds,
your brother, with such anger!

633
00:56:25,980 --> 00:56:28,850
Things are going on happening,
and we are just watching,

634
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:30,440
because we are tied today.

635
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:31,600
Let's be patient.

636
00:56:31,650 --> 00:56:33,100
Time will definitely change.

637
00:56:33,150 --> 00:56:37,100
Then the world will witness
justice being victorious!!!

638
00:56:37,310 --> 00:56:39,770
My hands hold the bow, brother!

639
00:56:39,810 --> 00:56:41,230
It's called the Kandeepam!

640
00:56:41,650 --> 00:56:47,020
Kings! reply to Draupadi's words.

641
00:56:47,060 --> 00:56:49,600
If we don't answer her questions,

642
00:56:49,650 --> 00:56:52,270
hell will burn us.

643
00:56:52,310 --> 00:56:55,810
Have our fathers ever sold their wives?

644
00:56:55,850 --> 00:57:00,520
Have we ever heard, of something as bizzare
as losing our queens at gambling?

645
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:03,440
But, our great generous King,

646
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:06,850
after losing himself and becoming a slave.

647
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:10,400
Doesn't have, a house or
a wife or any other relations!

648
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:14,810
When slavery is his only wealth.
What else can he pledge to play with?

649
00:57:14,940 --> 00:57:20,190
This is what, the queen is questioning
regarding her rights, to these cowards!!!

650
00:57:29,150 --> 00:57:30,310
I believe it sir!

651
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:34,810
It has to be Ayya who acted.

652
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:38,560
Before I made my first film, my father died.

653
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:42,020
After that, wherever I go,
I don't pray to any God.

654
00:57:42,350 --> 00:57:45,440
I pray to my father's photograph
and then only leave.

655
00:57:45,850 --> 00:57:51,020
I still believe that my father is with me
and taking care of me.

656
00:57:51,310 --> 00:57:53,230
When my father can be with me.

657
00:57:53,690 --> 00:57:56,520
Why can't Ayya be with all of you!

658
00:57:57,650 --> 00:58:00,310
I am not going to look for another actor.

659
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:02,520
I will come with the advance tomorrow.

660
00:58:02,810 --> 00:58:04,560
I will take Saravanan and go.

661
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:07,060
I have a feeling,

662
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:09,600
Ayya will come and act in my film.

663
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:14,850
I am not making a bad film.

664
00:58:15,150 --> 00:58:17,560
If Ayya acts in my film,

665
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:21,690
the remuneration which is given
to a hero, I will give it to you.

666
00:58:21,730 --> 00:58:23,480
In case Ayya doesn't come,

667
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:25,980
let the advance be with you.

668
00:58:43,150 --> 00:58:45,230
I will come tomorrow.

669
00:59:28,060 --> 00:59:29,980
Take grandfather's blessings.

670
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:24,100
Ayya has come.

671
01:01:00,060 --> 01:01:02,560
" Are you a shard of him?"

672
01:01:02,650 --> 01:01:05,190
" Are you a spark of him?"

673
01:01:05,230 --> 01:01:07,730
" Are you his shadow?"

674
01:01:07,770 --> 01:01:10,440
" Or are you him?!!!"

675
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:12,810
" Are you a shard of him?"

676
01:01:12,980 --> 01:01:15,350
" Are you a spark of him?"

677
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:17,690
" Are you his shadow?"

678
01:01:17,730 --> 01:01:20,270
" Or are you him?!!!"

679
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:30,520
Lets not postpone Tarun's
operation anymore.

680
01:01:47,730 --> 01:01:50,980
Let no one else know about this.

681
01:01:51,020 --> 01:01:52,980
They will talk without
understanding.

682
01:01:53,020 --> 01:01:54,270
Okay, sir.

683
01:01:56,100 --> 01:01:58,060
" As a spark, as a flame,"

684
01:01:58,100 --> 01:02:00,400
" within your eyes, I see his light."

685
01:02:01,100 --> 01:02:03,150
" As movement, as sound,"

686
01:02:03,190 --> 01:02:05,980
" your entire body oozes his language!!!"

687
01:02:06,020 --> 01:02:08,230
" After fire consuming him,"

688
01:02:08,270 --> 01:02:11,230
" he isn't finished even by a drop!!!"

689
01:02:11,270 --> 01:02:13,400
" After The Earth swallowing him,"

690
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:16,270
" deep... deeper... within you,
he grows!!!"

691
01:02:16,310 --> 01:02:18,440
" Your smile is him!"

692
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:21,230
" Your vision is him!"

693
01:02:21,270 --> 01:02:23,600
" Your words are him!"

694
01:02:23,650 --> 01:02:26,520
" The life you live is him and only him!"

695
01:02:26,560 --> 01:02:28,730
" Your path is him!"

696
01:02:28,770 --> 01:02:31,520
" Your path of flowers is him!"

697
01:02:31,560 --> 01:02:33,690
" The fragrance of the flowers is also him!"

698
01:02:33,730 --> 01:02:36,980
" The breath you take is him and only him!"

699
01:02:37,020 --> 01:02:38,730
" As a spark, as a flame,"

700
01:02:38,770 --> 01:02:40,350
" within your eyes, I see his light."

701
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:41,650
This is Saravanan.

702
01:02:41,690 --> 01:02:43,980
He's the new face, being introduced
as the hero in my film.

703
01:02:44,020 --> 01:02:46,270
" your entire body oozes his language!!!"

704
01:02:46,940 --> 01:02:48,900
" After fire consuming him,"

705
01:02:48,940 --> 01:02:51,900
" he isn't finished even by a drop!!!"

706
01:02:51,940 --> 01:02:54,190
" After The Earth swallowing him,"

707
01:02:54,230 --> 01:02:57,100
" deep... deeper... within you,
he grows!!!"

708
01:02:57,150 --> 01:03:00,350
No one has ever missbehaved
with me like this.

709
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:02,480
I am the wife of the
world famous Pandavas.

710
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:04,980
" Are you his shadow?"

711
01:03:05,020 --> 01:03:07,690
" Or are you him?!!!"

712
01:03:07,730 --> 01:03:10,100
" Are you a shard of him?"

713
01:03:10,270 --> 01:03:12,730
" Are you a spark of him?"

714
01:03:12,770 --> 01:03:15,350
" Are you his shadow?"

715
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:17,440
" Or are you him?!!!"

716
01:03:17,480 --> 01:03:20,440
Sir, a friend of mine wants to
narrate a story to Saravanan.

717
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:21,810
First, you listen to it.

718
01:03:21,850 --> 01:03:25,270
If you like the story, we can
discuss the other details later.

719
01:03:27,770 --> 01:03:29,190
Okay, lets listen to it.

720
01:03:33,230 --> 01:03:34,440
Hello sir.

721
01:03:36,270 --> 01:03:38,850
I heard it. It was nice.

722
01:03:40,190 --> 01:03:43,060
Okay, then Maran, shall I talk
to sir and let you know?

723
01:03:43,100 --> 01:03:44,350
Thanks a lot sir.

724
01:03:47,770 --> 01:03:49,100
Please come sir.

725
01:03:53,560 --> 01:03:55,940
It's what I have told you before.

726
01:03:55,980 --> 01:03:57,900
First let Ayya come and act.

727
01:03:58,020 --> 01:04:00,980
The rest can be spoken later.

728
01:04:10,310 --> 01:04:12,850
Ayya is acting in Maran's film.

729
01:04:14,150 --> 01:04:15,900
Continuously if good
stories keep coming,

730
01:04:15,940 --> 01:04:17,850
I think Ayya will keep
acting in films.

731
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:24,520
No, not this story.

732
01:04:29,310 --> 01:04:31,230
The story is nice.

733
01:04:31,730 --> 01:04:35,480
" You... are the play!"

734
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:38,060
" A very small play."

735
01:04:38,100 --> 01:04:41,440
" The new stage is him!!!"

736
01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:45,600
" You are a puppet."

737
01:04:45,650 --> 01:04:48,270
" An alive puppet,"

738
01:04:48,310 --> 01:04:51,850
" and he is the puppeteer!!!"

739
01:04:51,900 --> 01:04:54,230
" As a limitless dream,"

740
01:04:54,270 --> 01:04:56,850
" he lingers in your eyes!"

741
01:04:56,900 --> 01:04:59,190
" As never ending music,"

742
01:04:59,230 --> 01:05:02,100
" he lives in your ears!"

743
01:05:02,150 --> 01:05:04,190
" What a pity for death."

744
01:05:04,230 --> 01:05:06,060
" He has ruined its purpose."

745
01:05:06,100 --> 01:05:08,150
You have received the National
award in your debut film itself...

746
01:05:08,190 --> 01:05:10,520
I am very happy I got
the National award.

747
01:05:10,560 --> 01:05:13,810
But I consider the love of my
fans, as my biggest award.

748
01:05:13,850 --> 01:05:15,900
No, we don't want a bigger amount.

749
01:05:15,940 --> 01:05:17,350
First lets listen to the story.

750
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:19,440
If we like that, then
we can discuss the rest.

751
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:22,900
" your entire body oozes his language!!!"

752
01:05:22,940 --> 01:05:24,730
" After fire consuming him,"

753
01:05:24,770 --> 01:05:27,100
" he isn't finished even by a drop!!!"

754
01:05:27,150 --> 01:05:28,060
Saravanan has come.

755
01:05:28,100 --> 01:05:29,980
Come Saravanan.

756
01:05:30,020 --> 01:05:32,600
" deep... deeper... within you,
he grows!!!"

757
01:05:32,650 --> 01:05:35,060
" Your smile is him!"

758
01:05:35,100 --> 01:05:37,810
" Your vision is him!"

759
01:05:37,850 --> 01:05:40,100
" Your words are him!"

760
01:05:40,150 --> 01:05:43,020
" The life you live is him and only him!"

761
01:05:43,060 --> 01:05:45,230
" Your path is him!"

762
01:05:45,270 --> 01:05:47,940
" Your path of flowers, is him!"

763
01:05:47,980 --> 01:05:50,350
" The fragrance of the flowers is also him!"

764
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:53,400
" The breath you take is him and only him!"

765
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:55,980
" Are you a shard of him?"

766
01:05:56,150 --> 01:05:58,520
" Are you a spark of him?"

767
01:05:58,770 --> 01:06:01,100
" Are you his shadow?"

768
01:06:01,850 --> 01:06:05,150
There's a saying, that the
father of cinema is theatre.

769
01:06:05,190 --> 01:06:10,230
Saravanan is an actor with an
experienced theatre background.

770
01:06:10,270 --> 01:06:13,230
I have seen Saravanan's earlier film as well,

771
01:06:13,270 --> 01:06:17,060
and I have also seen 'Kanni Theevu',
for which he's won the award.

772
01:06:17,100 --> 01:06:23,190
His acting, is fresh, good
and devoid of any imitation.

773
01:06:23,230 --> 01:06:27,150
I wish he keeps growing and
I pray to the almighty for that,

774
01:06:27,190 --> 01:06:28,650
and my best wishes are with him.

775
01:06:28,690 --> 01:06:30,940
" Are you a shard of him?"

776
01:06:31,100 --> 01:06:33,440
" Are you a spark of him?"

777
01:06:33,480 --> 01:06:35,850
" Are you his shadow?"

778
01:06:36,310 --> 01:06:38,940
" Or are you him?!!!"

779
01:06:38,980 --> 01:06:40,400
" Are you a shard of him?"

780
01:06:40,440 --> 01:06:43,060
As of now I am not interested in politics.

781
01:06:43,980 --> 01:06:46,560
" Are you his shadow?"

782
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:49,980
" Or are you him?!!!"

783
01:06:52,350 --> 01:06:55,350
You ask the producer to call me,
I will discuss the other details with him.

784
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:56,600
Okay sir.

785
01:07:02,150 --> 01:07:04,400
Who is that Saravanan?

786
01:07:05,980 --> 01:07:08,190
The director of the next film.

787
01:07:08,230 --> 01:07:10,350
Next film? What film?

788
01:07:10,690 --> 01:07:13,100
I am committing to a new film,

789
01:07:17,020 --> 01:07:19,850
I heard the story, it's very good.

790
01:07:19,900 --> 01:07:21,850
You can't do that. I haven't heard it.

791
01:07:24,100 --> 01:07:25,900
Why can't I do it?

792
01:07:27,350 --> 01:07:28,650
Why trouble yourself.

793
01:07:28,690 --> 01:07:30,850
From now onwards
I will make the decisions.

794
01:07:30,900 --> 01:07:34,310
Saravanan, Ayya will not act
in just any kind of story.

795
01:07:36,770 --> 01:07:39,020
What do you mean,
Ayya! Ayya! for everything?

796
01:07:39,060 --> 01:07:42,600
I am working day and night.
People are coming to watch me.

797
01:07:42,650 --> 01:07:45,230
Your going on saying,
Ayya! Ayya! for everything.

798
01:07:46,940 --> 01:07:52,100
For you to give me a small amount
from my hard earned money is it?

799
01:07:55,150 --> 01:07:57,850
Even I have gratitude.

800
01:07:57,940 --> 01:08:00,350
After all I came from
your theatre group.

801
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:02,600
From now, I will decide
and give you something.

802
01:08:02,650 --> 01:08:06,230
You need not do anything.
That's what feels right to me.

803
01:08:23,350 --> 01:08:25,270
Go! Go!

804
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:26,810
Wait... wait...

805
01:08:26,850 --> 01:08:27,350
Give it.

806
01:08:27,400 --> 01:08:29,230
- Sir, me too.
- Come.

807
01:08:36,230 --> 01:08:37,100
Hello!

808
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:40,100
Hello!

809
01:08:41,060 --> 01:08:42,650
Hello!

810
01:08:49,650 --> 01:08:50,650
Take out the mirror.

811
01:08:50,690 --> 01:08:50,980
Have you eaten?

812
01:08:51,020 --> 01:08:52,440
- Yes, I have, what about you?
- I've eaten.

813
01:08:52,480 --> 01:08:53,230
What's the scene?

814
01:08:53,270 --> 01:08:58,150
Sir, in today's scene, you will be
seated alone on the park bench.

815
01:08:59,020 --> 01:09:00,480
After many days,

816
01:09:00,520 --> 01:09:03,350
you land up meeting, your
teenage love only now.

817
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:06,520
After seeing her, you're shocked.

818
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:09,020
She is also turning
and looking at you.

819
01:09:10,150 --> 01:09:11,730
After she turns...

820
01:09:14,940 --> 01:09:16,270
You continue.

821
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:18,810
She turns and looks
and you look at her too.

822
01:09:18,850 --> 01:09:23,100
You go through shock, surprise,
happiness, love, yearning,

823
01:09:23,150 --> 01:09:26,310
and you look at her with
all these mixed feelings.

824
01:09:27,270 --> 01:09:28,810
Is it not very hot,sir ?

825
01:09:28,850 --> 01:09:30,400
Get me juice?

826
01:09:30,440 --> 01:09:32,310
I am ready sir.
Where is the position, sir?

827
01:09:32,350 --> 01:09:33,900
On the bench.

828
01:09:35,190 --> 01:09:36,900
Sir, what about the girls?

829
01:09:37,100 --> 01:09:39,400
The girls, will be behind the tree.

830
01:09:41,810 --> 01:09:44,690
They will only be there.
You have to be here.

831
01:09:54,690 --> 01:09:55,900
I am ready sir.

832
01:09:55,980 --> 01:09:58,650
Sir, your first look is onto your right.

833
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:03,940
As you turn, the girls
will be on your left.

834
01:10:04,020 --> 01:10:06,900
After you see them only,
you give those reactions.

835
01:10:08,350 --> 01:10:11,270
Sir, that's for you to fix your look!

836
01:10:17,100 --> 01:10:18,520
Shall we roll, sir?

837
01:10:45,350 --> 01:10:47,060
Is it okay sir?

838
01:10:51,190 --> 01:10:53,900
This looks like you
knew and looked.

839
01:10:54,150 --> 01:10:55,690
I know her is it not?

840
01:10:56,810 --> 01:10:58,770
Yes, you know her,

841
01:10:58,810 --> 01:11:00,940
but you won't know she's there.

842
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:04,560
Turn around casually, that's it.

843
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:06,270
Casually?

844
01:11:07,480 --> 01:11:09,560
Do you require these flowers?

845
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:11,270
They are very disturbing.

846
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:15,900
Let's avoid the flowers.

847
01:11:18,350 --> 01:11:22,060
We can create all this through
CG these days, is it not ?

848
01:12:15,810 --> 01:12:17,350
Is it okay, sir?

849
01:12:17,850 --> 01:12:19,350
Shall we go to the next?

850
01:12:21,230 --> 01:12:23,190
I'll just take a look
at the playback.

851
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:25,190
I will also come, sir.

852
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:45,690
All that you said, shock,
surprise, happiness, love...

853
01:12:51,900 --> 01:12:53,650
Yearning.

854
01:13:07,770 --> 01:13:08,810
What sir?

855
01:13:08,850 --> 01:13:10,310
You became emotional is it?

856
01:13:10,350 --> 01:13:12,230
Everything is what you told me, sir.

857
01:13:13,730 --> 01:13:15,310
That's just a mood.

858
01:13:15,940 --> 01:13:18,980
It's not necessary to
do everything literally.

859
01:13:19,020 --> 01:13:20,900
I am a director's artiste.

860
01:13:20,940 --> 01:13:23,400
I will do whatever the
director asks me to do.

861
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:25,100
That's correct .

862
01:13:25,150 --> 01:13:27,940
Just one look, with all
these emotions mixed.

863
01:13:30,060 --> 01:13:32,940
How do you want me to mix it?

864
01:13:36,690 --> 01:13:38,940
Now, when you were in school...

865
01:13:46,100 --> 01:13:48,020
I am gonna mix it... watch...

866
01:14:05,060 --> 01:14:07,560
Is he doing it purposely?

867
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:14,940
Mixed, doesn't mean this, sir.

868
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:17,900
How else should I mix it?

869
01:14:20,480 --> 01:14:23,020
Okay, just forget everything
I told you till now.

870
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:24,770
Forget and...?

871
01:14:26,100 --> 01:14:30,100
You have been in love with a
girl during your school days.

872
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:32,770
Yes...

873
01:14:32,940 --> 01:14:36,270
You're seeing that girl
now after many days.

874
01:14:36,520 --> 01:14:37,980
I am seeing...

875
01:14:38,650 --> 01:14:41,020
How will you look at a girl you loved?

876
01:14:41,810 --> 01:14:46,060
Sir, that's simple, just leave it to me.
I'll take care.

877
01:15:18,690 --> 01:15:20,730
It's too melodramatic.

878
01:15:22,940 --> 01:15:27,190
Not like that sir, whatever you
did now, just make it subtle.

879
01:15:29,480 --> 01:15:31,350
Subtle?

880
01:15:38,940 --> 01:15:41,020
Please tell me everything earlier.

881
01:15:41,060 --> 01:15:42,190
Okay sir.

882
01:15:42,230 --> 01:15:44,480
All this is running in your mind,

883
01:15:44,520 --> 01:15:46,600
and then just one look.

884
01:15:46,650 --> 01:15:49,310
Don't show too many facial expressions.

885
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:32,310
Why have you gotten up?

886
01:16:32,350 --> 01:16:33,520
I finished doing it.

887
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:37,730
Sir, there was nothing,
it was just blank.

888
01:16:37,940 --> 01:16:39,770
It was lifeless.

889
01:16:49,810 --> 01:16:53,100
Why not... now it will be there.

890
01:17:18,310 --> 01:17:21,100
Let your teeth not show so much.

891
01:17:25,810 --> 01:17:29,060
If I do it well you're
saying it's melodramatic.

892
01:17:29,100 --> 01:17:30,980
If I do it subtly you're
saying it's blank.

893
01:17:31,020 --> 01:17:32,900
How can I laugh, without
my teeth showing?

894
01:17:33,100 --> 01:17:35,230
What you did only.

895
01:17:35,270 --> 01:17:36,980
Don't show so much of your teeth,

896
01:17:37,020 --> 01:17:39,020
when so much shows,
it doesn't look good.

897
01:17:39,060 --> 01:17:39,810
Okay sir.

898
01:17:40,100 --> 01:17:43,350
One final take without
the teeth showing.

899
01:18:35,190 --> 01:18:37,400
You don't even have to turn,

900
01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:40,400
just the look, lets try one more.

901
01:18:41,400 --> 01:18:42,440
Lets try, sir.

902
01:18:45,310 --> 01:18:47,560
Sir, am feeling a little uneasy,

903
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:49,600
shall I have a tea, and come?

904
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:53,350
Okay sir, go and come.

905
01:18:57,850 --> 01:18:59,770
What's happened to him?

906
01:18:59,850 --> 01:19:01,440
That's what I don't know.

907
01:19:01,480 --> 01:19:04,190
Last week how well he
performed the interval scene.

908
01:19:04,230 --> 01:19:07,150
Why is he messing up
so much today?

909
01:19:07,910 --> 01:19:08,750
Sir, tea.

910
01:19:08,830 --> 01:19:09,830
I don't want.

911
01:19:16,580 --> 01:19:17,700
Brother!

912
01:19:19,250 --> 01:19:22,120
There was an elderly man
inside, did you see him?

913
01:19:22,160 --> 01:19:23,620
Who? Parasuraman sir?

914
01:19:23,660 --> 01:19:24,160
Hmmm...

915
01:19:24,200 --> 01:19:26,040
He left long back.

916
01:20:08,200 --> 01:20:09,330
What is it sir?

917
01:20:09,910 --> 01:20:11,120
Let's start.

918
01:20:40,500 --> 01:20:42,910
It looks like you're
thinking and turning.

919
01:20:43,700 --> 01:20:45,330
Thinking is it...

920
01:20:53,660 --> 01:20:56,750
Sir, this looks like
you're turning in fear.

921
01:20:57,580 --> 01:20:59,040
Fear is it...

922
01:21:03,200 --> 01:21:05,450
Sir, This looks like you're nervous.

923
01:21:05,750 --> 01:21:06,910
Nervous is it, sir?

924
01:21:06,950 --> 01:21:07,580
Yes!

925
01:21:19,950 --> 01:21:21,750
What happened?

926
01:21:22,250 --> 01:21:24,790
It's busted. The fuse has gone.

927
01:21:32,620 --> 01:21:34,540
Sir, just a minute.

928
01:21:37,500 --> 01:21:38,450
What?

929
01:21:39,790 --> 01:21:41,540
I am not feeling too well.

930
01:21:41,750 --> 01:21:43,580
Shall we do it tomorrow?

931
01:21:43,790 --> 01:21:46,540
Sir, you could have
told me this earlier.

932
01:21:47,500 --> 01:21:49,120
Okay, go.

933
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:53,290
Hey!

934
01:21:53,330 --> 01:21:55,450
What are the other
shots without him?

935
01:21:55,500 --> 01:21:58,370
- Where is the heroine?
- She has just landed.

936
01:22:20,540 --> 01:22:21,870
Sir.

937
01:22:38,330 --> 01:22:40,160
I was wrong.

938
01:22:40,830 --> 01:22:42,620
Please forgive me.

939
01:22:45,700 --> 01:22:48,370
You listen to the stories and decide.

940
01:22:48,410 --> 01:22:50,700
If you say no, it's a no.

941
01:22:53,500 --> 01:22:56,120
Please ask Ayya to come and act.

942
01:23:03,580 --> 01:23:05,660
You, please leave.

943
01:23:07,790 --> 01:23:08,870
Sir.

944
01:24:28,790 --> 01:24:30,450
Saravanan.

945
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:54,160
What's the problem?

946
01:24:56,120 --> 01:24:57,330
Tell me Saravanan.

947
01:24:57,450 --> 01:24:59,250
Any problem with your health?

948
01:25:00,370 --> 01:25:01,450
No, sir.

949
01:25:02,830 --> 01:25:04,370
Any family problem.

950
01:25:06,040 --> 01:25:08,830
Nothing like that sir.

951
01:25:10,370 --> 01:25:12,540
Then why are you so nervous?

952
01:25:15,250 --> 01:25:17,370
No sir, today we will do it.

953
01:25:17,410 --> 01:25:19,000
Today I will act.

954
01:25:19,620 --> 01:25:21,370
Are you sure, you can do it?

955
01:25:21,540 --> 01:25:22,290
Sure?

956
01:25:28,410 --> 01:25:30,620
Your face is filled with fear.

957
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:37,040
Think of me like your brother.

958
01:25:38,250 --> 01:25:40,410
Whatever it is tell me.

959
01:25:46,120 --> 01:25:47,830
Sir,

960
01:25:48,290 --> 01:25:50,040
I confess,

961
01:25:50,500 --> 01:25:52,450
all these days I wasn't acting.

962
01:25:56,620 --> 01:25:59,500
Ayya, who was within my body,
was only acting.

963
01:26:00,500 --> 01:26:02,040
Ayya, means?

964
01:26:02,580 --> 01:26:03,830
Ayya... sir.

965
01:26:04,250 --> 01:26:07,200
Aadhimoolam Ayya,
who was in our theatre group.

966
01:26:07,410 --> 01:26:09,750
He was only within my body
and has been acting.

967
01:26:11,910 --> 01:26:16,000
Thyagu sir, called me
to act in his film...

968
01:26:17,160 --> 01:26:19,540
Parasuraman only sent me.

969
01:26:20,250 --> 01:26:22,540
In that film, it was me physically,

970
01:26:22,580 --> 01:26:24,160
but it was Ayya, who acted.

971
01:26:26,910 --> 01:26:29,580
Yesterday I saw it with my own eyes.

972
01:26:31,040 --> 01:26:33,870
Now, suddenly, Ayya is not coming.

973
01:26:36,200 --> 01:26:39,500
That's why I am very
confused from yesterday.

974
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:45,120
Sir, I am very new to theatre.

975
01:26:45,160 --> 01:26:47,540
No matter how many takes you go for,

976
01:26:47,580 --> 01:26:50,750
I am not sure whether I will
deliver what you want.

977
01:26:50,870 --> 01:26:53,370
Sir, there is only one way out.

978
01:26:53,540 --> 01:26:55,080
What is it?

979
01:26:56,620 --> 01:26:59,080
Ayya has to come.

980
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,410
Hey! Is your hero into any drugs?

981
01:27:12,450 --> 01:27:14,120
Nothing like that, sir.

982
01:27:24,500 --> 01:27:25,750
Tell me Sundar ?

983
01:27:26,040 --> 01:27:28,250
Saravanan was performing very well.

984
01:27:28,290 --> 01:27:31,580
Now, he's not even able to
give a simple expression.

985
01:27:31,620 --> 01:27:32,750
When I asked him,

986
01:27:32,790 --> 01:27:35,120
he's saying, someone called
Ayya from his theatre group,

987
01:27:35,160 --> 01:27:36,290
only was inside him
and was acting.

988
01:27:36,330 --> 01:27:37,410
Now for the past two days
Ayya is not coming,

989
01:27:37,450 --> 01:27:40,660
and that's why he is unable to perform,
he is blabbering some rubbish.

990
01:27:40,700 --> 01:27:42,580
Has he disclosed everything?

991
01:27:43,370 --> 01:27:44,950
What does that mean?

992
01:27:45,120 --> 01:27:47,330
Sundar? You have seen my film...

993
01:27:47,370 --> 01:27:48,750
Did he act in that film?

994
01:27:48,790 --> 01:27:50,250
If he didn't perform then...

995
01:27:50,290 --> 01:27:51,620
He's telling the truth.

996
01:27:51,660 --> 01:27:52,910
He didn't perform.

997
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:54,410
Ayya only acted.

998
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,910
I have seen Ayya
acting through him,

999
01:27:58,950 --> 01:28:00,910
and I've seen him
acting without Ayya.

1000
01:28:00,950 --> 01:28:03,160
It's up to you to
believe it or not.

1001
01:28:03,200 --> 01:28:04,830
But this is what
happened in my film.

1002
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,290
Okay, let what you're
saying be the truth.

1003
01:28:07,330 --> 01:28:09,950
Then why can't he just come
and act in my film.

1004
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:11,950
That's what I am not
able to understand.

1005
01:28:12,080 --> 01:28:13,950
You wouldn't have done anything.

1006
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:15,410
Did he do anything wrong?

1007
01:28:15,410 --> 01:28:17,750
Thyagu, I am really losing it.

1008
01:28:17,790 --> 01:28:20,080
There is no use you getting tensed,

1009
01:28:20,120 --> 01:28:21,290
there is just one
solution to this.

1010
01:28:21,910 --> 01:28:22,830
What?

1011
01:28:23,120 --> 01:28:26,250
What he's saying only,
Ayya has to come and act.

1012
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:31,040
What is this?

1013
01:28:31,080 --> 01:28:33,950
This story, seems to be more
fictitious than your movie's story.

1014
01:28:34,040 --> 01:28:35,620
What do I look like to you?

1015
01:28:35,660 --> 01:28:37,200
That you can just
say any rubbish.

1016
01:28:37,250 --> 01:28:37,830
Why?

1017
01:28:37,870 --> 01:28:40,910
What you have shot till now,
has not come out properly is it?

1018
01:28:41,080 --> 01:28:42,160
Nothing like that, sir.

1019
01:28:42,200 --> 01:28:45,950
Till date, I have not
liked any of your films.

1020
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,620
Everything would look very dark.

1021
01:28:49,950 --> 01:28:52,910
In spite of that, do you know
why I signed you?

1022
01:28:52,950 --> 01:28:55,120
Since, you got his dates.

1023
01:28:55,160 --> 01:28:57,200
Now, how can you say
you don't want him?

1024
01:28:58,450 --> 01:29:00,290
Why would I lie?

1025
01:29:00,330 --> 01:29:02,620
Without believing what he said,
I called director Thyagu...

1026
01:29:02,660 --> 01:29:04,580
Don't tell me all these stories.

1027
01:29:04,620 --> 01:29:06,950
I have borrowed money on interest
and am producing the film.

1028
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,000
So far, ten days of shoot
has been completed.

1029
01:29:09,040 --> 01:29:12,000
I have taken lot of money, banking
on the business of this film.

1030
01:29:12,040 --> 01:29:12,700
Do you know!

1031
01:29:35,450 --> 01:29:37,620
I don't know what and
how you're going to do it.

1032
01:29:37,660 --> 01:29:40,040
Take time till the
festival holidays get over.

1033
01:29:40,080 --> 01:29:42,620
Train him properly
and complete the film.

1034
01:29:42,660 --> 01:29:44,790
We can't change the hero now.

1035
01:29:45,910 --> 01:29:48,580
Training him is not as
easy as you think.

1036
01:29:49,080 --> 01:29:50,370
You may leave.

1037
01:29:52,910 --> 01:29:55,040
You may leave.

1038
01:30:06,540 --> 01:30:08,000
"News is out,"

1039
01:30:08,040 --> 01:30:10,830
"that, all the films, actor
Saravanan featured in,"

1040
01:30:10,870 --> 01:30:15,250
"he did not act, but through him the late
legendary theatre actor Aadhimoolam,"

1041
01:30:15,290 --> 01:30:16,250
"has acted."

1042
01:30:16,290 --> 01:30:21,120
"When enquired about this, Actor Saravanan
and his debut director Thyagu,"

1043
01:30:21,160 --> 01:30:23,580
"have confirmed the news.
Which has further added,"

1044
01:30:23,620 --> 01:30:25,540
"to the shock and astonishment."

1045
01:30:25,580 --> 01:30:29,330
"When Ayya's associate,
Parasuraman spoke about this..."

1046
01:30:29,540 --> 01:30:31,830
Acting was Ayya's life.

1047
01:30:31,870 --> 01:30:34,040
That life hasn't gone anywhere.

1048
01:30:34,410 --> 01:30:36,660
He was acting till he was alive.

1049
01:30:36,870 --> 01:30:39,200
He died while he was acting.

1050
01:30:40,660 --> 01:30:42,330
After his death,

1051
01:30:42,700 --> 01:30:44,830
he is still acting through someone.

1052
01:30:47,620 --> 01:30:51,870
Our Ayya, is now
taking care of all our lives.

1053
01:30:51,870 --> 01:30:55,450
"When senior film director Bharathiraja
spoke about this, he said..."

1054
01:30:55,500 --> 01:30:57,080
Look here.

1055
01:30:57,120 --> 01:31:00,620
All of you may or
may not believe this.

1056
01:31:00,660 --> 01:31:05,620
As far as I am concerned, artistes
just don't disappear like that.

1057
01:31:05,910 --> 01:31:09,000
They will definitely be
living through someone.

1058
01:31:09,750 --> 01:31:11,500
Ayya. Aadhimoolam.

1059
01:31:11,870 --> 01:31:14,950
I have seen many of his plays.

1060
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,200
I am a very big fan of his.

1061
01:31:17,870 --> 01:31:22,120
Once, I had asked him to
act in one of my films.

1062
01:31:22,290 --> 01:31:24,120
He had refused.

1063
01:31:24,540 --> 01:31:27,290
The reason he gave for that...
he said...

1064
01:31:27,450 --> 01:31:29,660
"As long as I am functioning,"

1065
01:31:29,700 --> 01:31:31,250
"and I am alive,"

1066
01:31:31,290 --> 01:31:35,790
"I wish to act only in front
of a live audience."

1067
01:31:35,830 --> 01:31:37,450
I missed the chance.

1068
01:31:37,500 --> 01:31:41,910
I have heard a lot about all these films,
have not yet seen them.

1069
01:31:42,040 --> 01:31:44,000
I am eager to watch them.

1070
01:31:59,620 --> 01:32:00,870
Brother.

1071
01:32:00,910 --> 01:32:02,450
Greetings sir.

1072
01:32:02,540 --> 01:32:03,830
Sit down.

1073
01:32:10,870 --> 01:32:12,910
Sir, I am Ravi of Thaai Productions.

1074
01:32:12,950 --> 01:32:16,660
I have come to ask for Ayya's
dates for my next film.

1075
01:32:18,040 --> 01:32:19,250
Brilliant story.

1076
01:32:20,660 --> 01:32:22,620
Story revolves around the girl.

1077
01:32:22,660 --> 01:32:24,580
We have even found the girl.

1078
01:32:24,620 --> 01:32:25,790
But the acting...

1079
01:32:27,250 --> 01:32:31,120
Ayya had acted as a female
character in one of his stage plays.

1080
01:32:31,160 --> 01:32:34,160
If Ayya can act like that,
it would be very good.

1081
01:32:35,120 --> 01:32:37,250
Without knowing the story...

1082
01:32:37,290 --> 01:32:38,910
We will tell you the whole story,

1083
01:32:38,950 --> 01:32:41,870
only if Ayya likes it, let him
come and act in it.

1084
01:32:41,910 --> 01:32:45,120
If Ayya comes and acts,
what more do we need.

1085
01:32:46,870 --> 01:32:47,410
Sir,

1086
01:32:47,450 --> 01:32:49,950
I am Ramesh of Kaalikambal films.

1087
01:32:51,410 --> 01:32:53,950
I want Ayya to act in my film also.

1088
01:32:56,200 --> 01:32:57,830
It's a story about a father and son.

1089
01:32:57,870 --> 01:33:00,370
Ayya would be playing both
the father and the son.

1090
01:33:00,410 --> 01:33:01,500
It's a dual role.

1091
01:33:03,500 --> 01:33:07,580
Sir, in my film, it's a five year
old child's character for Ayya!

1092
01:33:30,410 --> 01:33:31,660
It is a nice story.

1093
01:33:41,330 --> 01:33:42,450
" Throughout The Revolving Universe..."

1094
01:33:42,500 --> 01:33:44,080
" His fame will spread,
as he reveals his face..."

1095
01:33:44,120 --> 01:33:46,750
" Life leaves him, still the Silver Screen
witnesses his talent!!!"

1096
01:33:46,790 --> 01:33:48,120
" Never Before! Never After!"

1097
01:33:48,160 --> 01:33:49,540
" Unparalleled is his amazing Act!"

1098
01:33:49,580 --> 01:33:52,200
" The eyes are transfixed!
As the art unveils on Screen!"

1099
01:33:52,200 --> 01:33:53,620
" Within the Projector's
beam that streams..."

1100
01:33:53,660 --> 01:33:55,000
" His art merges to
light up the Screen!"

1101
01:33:55,040 --> 01:33:57,500
" Even tied hands will clap and
the sounds surpass the Seas!!!"

1102
01:33:57,500 --> 01:33:58,830
" Breaking through dams..."

1103
01:33:58,830 --> 01:34:00,450
" He's a massive flood
that flows over!"

1104
01:34:00,450 --> 01:34:02,870
" As it rushes by, baseless
seeds are washed away..."

1105
01:34:08,370 --> 01:34:11,080
What are you all doing still? quick!

1106
01:34:11,950 --> 01:34:12,950
No sir,

1107
01:34:13,200 --> 01:34:15,160
on that date Ayya can't come.

1108
01:34:15,200 --> 01:34:17,450
He has a play.
Please understand.

1109
01:34:17,750 --> 01:34:19,700
Yes,okay.

1110
01:34:19,950 --> 01:34:22,750
- Are you ready?
- Yes!

1111
01:34:29,500 --> 01:34:31,000
Like you said,

1112
01:34:31,500 --> 01:34:34,580
I am experiencing loneliness.

1113
01:34:34,790 --> 01:34:37,700
From the top of my reign,
I look down.

1114
01:34:38,200 --> 01:34:41,500
All I see is just emptiness!

1115
01:34:41,540 --> 01:34:44,290
" An endless Fountain!!!"

1116
01:34:44,330 --> 01:34:46,830
" A changeless Change!!!"

1117
01:34:46,830 --> 01:34:52,410
" He will reach unreached Depths!!!"

1118
01:34:52,410 --> 01:34:55,120
" An endless Fountain!!!"

1119
01:34:56,160 --> 01:34:58,250
No, not this story.

1120
01:34:58,290 --> 01:35:03,290
" Without living he lives On!!!"

1121
01:35:03,290 --> 01:35:03,910
"AYYA!!!"

1122
01:35:03,950 --> 01:35:06,000
" Who can obstruct
The Mighty Sun with a hand!"

1123
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:06,660
"AYYA!!!"

1124
01:35:06,700 --> 01:35:08,750
" Who can ever understand
the intent of THE CREATOR!"

1125
01:35:08,750 --> 01:35:09,370
"AYYA!!!"

1126
01:35:09,410 --> 01:35:11,700
" He will overcome death, destroying
darkness, giving light he will Rise!!!"

1127
01:35:11,700 --> 01:35:14,250
"AYYA!!!"

1128
01:35:14,290 --> 01:35:14,870
"AYYA!!!"

1129
01:35:14,910 --> 01:35:17,000
" Who can obstruct
The Mighty Sun with a hand!"

1130
01:35:17,040 --> 01:35:17,620
"AYYA!!!"

1131
01:35:17,660 --> 01:35:19,620
" Who can ever understand
the intent of THE CREATOR!"

1132
01:35:19,620 --> 01:35:20,250
" AYYA!!!"

1133
01:35:20,250 --> 01:35:22,580
" He will overcome death, destroying
darkness, giving light he will Rise!!!"

1134
01:35:22,580 --> 01:35:24,290
"AYYA!!!"

1135
01:35:25,830 --> 01:35:29,500
Sir, we are producing films
for the last fifty years.

1136
01:35:29,540 --> 01:35:33,290
The family priest told us not to produce,
for the last seven and a half years.

1137
01:35:33,330 --> 01:35:35,450
After that, this is the
first film I am producing.

1138
01:35:35,500 --> 01:35:37,410
Ayya should definitely act in it.

1139
01:35:37,450 --> 01:35:38,910
Isn't that the trend today.

1140
01:35:40,290 --> 01:35:41,330
Story?

1141
01:35:41,370 --> 01:35:44,200
It's a nice family subject
about a middle aged man.

1142
01:35:44,250 --> 01:35:47,120
The director will tell you
the whole story.

1143
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:50,160
Sir, the story happens in Chennai.

1144
01:36:00,450 --> 01:36:03,750
The story is nice,
we can do it.

1145
01:36:06,660 --> 01:36:07,830
Who is the hero?

1146
01:36:07,870 --> 01:36:09,950
For Ayya to perform,
you just need a body.

1147
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:11,830
Let this be that body.

1148
01:36:19,750 --> 01:36:22,330
Ayya. Aadhimoolam

1149
01:36:42,660 --> 01:36:45,830
No sir, Ayya is not free on that date.

1150
01:36:46,870 --> 01:36:51,120
He can't be acting in one film
during the day, and another at night.

1151
01:36:51,160 --> 01:36:52,500
You can do one thing,

1152
01:36:52,540 --> 01:36:54,830
he is free on the 20th and
21st, will you shoot then?

1153
01:36:54,830 --> 01:36:58,120
That one ad in the paper is wrong.
Ayya has not acted in that film.

1154
01:36:58,160 --> 01:36:59,500
They have just put it.

1155
01:36:59,540 --> 01:37:01,410
Please don't get cheated by fakes.

1156
01:37:01,410 --> 01:37:02,580
" In the sky that house's the stars..."

1157
01:37:02,660 --> 01:37:03,790
" In the sky that house's the stars..."

1158
01:37:03,790 --> 01:37:05,200
" He will be the cloud that
holds the Lightning!!!"

1159
01:37:05,250 --> 01:37:06,450
" He will be the cloud that
holds the Lightning!!!"

1160
01:37:06,450 --> 01:37:07,870
" The sounds of the entire sea..."

1161
01:37:07,950 --> 01:37:09,080
" The sounds of the entire sea..."

1162
01:37:09,080 --> 01:37:10,330
" He will be The Conch that contains it!!!"

1163
01:37:10,410 --> 01:37:11,660
" He will be The Conch that contains it!!!"

1164
01:37:11,660 --> 01:37:13,160
" For all the trees
that grow in the forest..."

1165
01:37:13,250 --> 01:37:14,540
" For all the trees
that grow in the forest..."

1166
01:37:14,540 --> 01:37:15,870
" He is the Seed!!!"

1167
01:37:15,950 --> 01:37:17,120
" He is the Seed!!!"

1168
01:37:17,160 --> 01:37:18,370
" For the wind that caresses..."

1169
01:37:18,410 --> 01:37:20,120
" For the wind that caresses..."

1170
01:37:20,160 --> 01:37:21,910
" He will be The Flute that
transforms it to Music!!!"

1171
01:37:21,910 --> 01:37:23,290
" In the sky that house's the stars..."

1172
01:37:23,290 --> 01:37:24,540
" He will be the cloud
that holds the Lightning!!!"

1173
01:37:24,540 --> 01:37:25,950
" The sounds of the entire sea..."

1174
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:27,370
" He will be The Conch that contains it!!!"

1175
01:37:27,370 --> 01:37:28,700
" For all the trees
that grow in the forest..."

1176
01:37:28,700 --> 01:37:30,080
" He is the Seed!!!"

1177
01:37:30,080 --> 01:37:31,410
" For the wind that caresses..."

1178
01:37:31,450 --> 01:37:32,750
" He will be The Flute that
transforms it to Music!!!"

1179
01:37:32,750 --> 01:37:34,120
" Splintering Specks
THE STATUE HE IS!!!"

1180
01:37:34,160 --> 01:37:35,500
" He is the Electrifying Storm!!!"

1181
01:37:35,500 --> 01:37:36,870
" He is the Whiplashing Wave!!!"

1182
01:37:36,910 --> 01:37:38,290
" He is the Resurrected Permanence!!!"

1183
01:37:38,290 --> 01:37:41,040
" He is the Fire within
the unstruck match!!!"

1184
01:37:41,040 --> 01:37:41,750
" A lifespan has limits..."

1185
01:37:41,790 --> 01:37:42,950
" That is imprisoned in our body..."

1186
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:43,700
" He shatters these norms!"

1187
01:37:43,700 --> 01:37:46,040
" Who can obstruct
The Mighty Sun with a hand!"

1188
01:37:46,080 --> 01:37:46,700
"AYYA!!!"

1189
01:37:46,750 --> 01:37:48,790
" Who can ever understand
the intent of THE CREATOR!"

1190
01:37:48,830 --> 01:37:49,370
" AYYA!!!"

1191
01:37:49,410 --> 01:37:51,750
" He will overcome death, destroying
darkness, giving light he will Rise!!!"

1192
01:37:51,790 --> 01:37:54,250
" AYYA!!!"

1193
01:37:54,330 --> 01:37:54,830
" AYYA!!!"

1194
01:37:54,870 --> 01:37:56,950
" Who can obstruct
The Mighty Sun with a hand!"

1195
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:57,580
" AYYA!!!"

1196
01:37:57,620 --> 01:37:59,660
" Who can ever understand
the intent of THE CREATOR!"

1197
01:37:59,660 --> 01:38:00,250
" AYYA!!!"

1198
01:38:00,290 --> 01:38:05,620
" He will overcome death, destroying
darkness, giving light he will Rise!!!"

1199
01:38:35,450 --> 01:38:38,040
Is this the story they told you?

1200
01:38:51,040 --> 01:38:52,910
Isn't the shooting going on here?

1201
01:38:52,950 --> 01:38:54,160
Yes. Inside the factory.

1202
01:42:07,250 --> 01:42:14,540
"From this moment, you are my God forever!"

1203
01:42:14,870 --> 01:42:19,410
"In your hands I seek refuge."

1204
01:42:19,580 --> 01:42:22,370
"A young woman I am!"

1205
01:42:26,870 --> 01:42:28,000
You rocked sir.

1206
01:42:28,040 --> 01:42:29,330
You have outdone yourself sir!

1207
01:42:29,370 --> 01:42:30,830
Don't forget me sir.

1208
01:42:30,870 --> 01:42:32,080
Sure master.

1209
01:42:32,620 --> 01:42:34,290
Sure master.

1210
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:37,750
Did the romance come out,
like the way you wanted?

1211
01:42:37,830 --> 01:42:38,700
Yes... yes...

1212
01:42:38,790 --> 01:42:39,580
All the romantic sequences?

1213
01:42:39,620 --> 01:42:40,290
Superb!

1214
01:42:40,620 --> 01:42:41,200
Superb is it?

1215
01:42:41,250 --> 01:42:42,410
It was good.

1216
01:42:43,540 --> 01:42:44,200
Will meet tomorrow.

1217
01:42:44,290 --> 01:42:45,580
Will meet tomorrow, sir.

1218
01:42:46,830 --> 01:42:48,790
Parasuraman, when did you come?

1219
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:50,160
A while ago.

1220
01:42:53,790 --> 01:42:55,330
Sit down.

1221
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:02,290
I heard, the film release today
had a fantastic opening.

1222
01:43:04,660 --> 01:43:07,790
Ours is going to beat all this
and reach great heights.

1223
01:43:11,120 --> 01:43:13,830
Hey, can't you serve him
some coffee or tea?

1224
01:43:14,500 --> 01:43:15,750
I don't want.

1225
01:43:15,830 --> 01:43:16,620
Leave.

1226
01:43:17,450 --> 01:43:19,700
Which film is this,
you're acting in?

1227
01:43:19,750 --> 01:43:21,580
What are you asking!

1228
01:43:21,660 --> 01:43:22,450
Our film, only!

1229
01:43:22,500 --> 01:43:25,000
They are trying to rape
the second heroine,

1230
01:43:25,040 --> 01:43:26,790
I am only trying to save her.

1231
01:43:26,830 --> 01:43:27,870
She gets emotional,

1232
01:43:27,910 --> 01:43:29,750
runs towards me and hugs me.

1233
01:43:29,790 --> 01:43:32,200
From there we cut to
a song in Mauritius.

1234
01:43:32,250 --> 01:43:33,700
We are going there next week.

1235
01:43:33,750 --> 01:43:36,450
When you narrated the story to me,
all these scenes weren't there!

1236
01:43:36,500 --> 01:43:40,160
We have to do certain things,
keeping the gallery audience in mind.

1237
01:43:40,200 --> 01:43:42,000
That's why these fights and songs.

1238
01:43:42,040 --> 01:43:45,750
But, don't you have to take,
only the story you told me!

1239
01:43:45,750 --> 01:43:47,000
This was what, I told...

1240
01:43:47,040 --> 01:43:49,580
While narrating how can we,
dance and fight and show you.

1241
01:43:49,620 --> 01:43:51,160
Make only what you told me.

1242
01:43:51,200 --> 01:43:52,410
Don't do all this.

1243
01:43:52,450 --> 01:43:56,250
Listen, for the kind of market
value Ayya has today,

1244
01:43:56,290 --> 01:43:57,830
if there are no songs and fights,

1245
01:43:57,870 --> 01:43:59,540
tomorrow they will question me,

1246
01:43:59,580 --> 01:44:01,500
no one will question you.

1247
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:03,580
No, everything is going wrong.

1248
01:44:03,580 --> 01:44:05,950
What? What is going wrong?

1249
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:07,910
We are filming the story
we told you.

1250
01:44:07,950 --> 01:44:09,660
We can't just shoot a bland film.

1251
01:44:09,750 --> 01:44:12,370
We have to add certain elements
for the sake of the audience.

1252
01:44:12,410 --> 01:44:15,160
Not wanting all of that is why,
Ayya never acted in films.

1253
01:44:15,200 --> 01:44:18,000
Today people are watching,
without all those elements!

1254
01:44:18,080 --> 01:44:20,500
Oh! Come on!
Look here Parasu...

1255
01:44:20,540 --> 01:44:22,540
Now how do I,
make you understand.

1256
01:44:22,580 --> 01:44:24,700
Ayya has clicked with
the upmarket audience.

1257
01:44:24,790 --> 01:44:27,410
Only now, he is slowly going
down to the gallery audience.

1258
01:44:27,450 --> 01:44:29,910
Shouldn't we further take him down.

1259
01:44:30,830 --> 01:44:32,660
Is it enough for him
to be in Tamil alone?

1260
01:44:32,700 --> 01:44:35,120
Don't you want him to
act in other languages?

1261
01:44:35,160 --> 01:44:37,790
Wait and watch, he's going
to be a national star.

1262
01:44:37,870 --> 01:44:39,830
No... no need all this.

1263
01:44:39,870 --> 01:44:42,370
What is this? Why are you going
on saying the same thing?

1264
01:44:42,410 --> 01:44:43,790
The growth of such
talented people,

1265
01:44:43,830 --> 01:44:48,200
is always stopped by
people with him, like you.

1266
01:44:48,250 --> 01:44:50,870
You don't unnecessarily
interfere in this.

1267
01:44:50,910 --> 01:44:52,910
Mind your own business.

1268
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:57,000
I've already paid for Ayya
to come and act in this film.

1269
01:44:57,040 --> 01:44:58,830
Ayya is coming and acting.

1270
01:44:58,870 --> 01:45:01,500
Now it's between me and Ayya.

1271
01:45:01,540 --> 01:45:03,080
What's your problem?

1272
01:45:12,910 --> 01:45:15,870
Sir, tomorrow the shooting is
at the hero's house.

1273
01:45:15,910 --> 01:45:16,580
What time?

1274
01:45:16,620 --> 01:45:18,290
Morning 7am sir.

1275
01:45:18,330 --> 01:45:20,080
Okay. I will be there.

1276
01:45:39,910 --> 01:45:41,200
I'll call you.

1277
01:46:03,580 --> 01:46:04,540
Sir, now...

1278
01:46:04,580 --> 01:46:07,540
You're ready to go to office,
you're walking down the stairs.

1279
01:46:07,620 --> 01:46:09,950
You're looking everywhere
for your wife.

1280
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:11,500
She's in the kitchen.

1281
01:46:11,540 --> 01:46:14,660
You call out to her affectionately, "Ma...",

1282
01:46:14,700 --> 01:46:19,330
We cut to, her saying, "what dear?",
and running towards you.

1283
01:46:19,410 --> 01:46:23,000
After that... No sir, first,
lets film till this point .

1284
01:46:23,120 --> 01:46:24,000
Ma...

1285
01:46:24,290 --> 01:46:25,200
Ma...

1286
01:46:29,620 --> 01:46:30,540
Take ma...

1287
01:46:49,080 --> 01:46:50,290
Ma...

1288
01:46:54,500 --> 01:46:56,540
Sir, it sounded very rude.

1289
01:46:56,870 --> 01:46:58,540
It has to be affectionate.

1290
01:46:58,950 --> 01:47:00,330
Wasn't it affectionate?

1291
01:47:00,370 --> 01:47:01,200
No, sir.

1292
01:47:01,250 --> 01:47:04,370
Let it sound very affectionate sir.

1293
01:47:22,120 --> 01:47:23,450
Amma...

1294
01:47:26,410 --> 01:47:29,410
Sir, that sounds like
you're calling your mother,

1295
01:47:29,450 --> 01:47:30,790
not your wife.

1296
01:47:30,830 --> 01:47:31,620
Is that so?

1297
01:47:31,660 --> 01:47:32,660
Yes, sir.

1298
01:47:33,120 --> 01:47:35,370
Just explain that scene once more.

1299
01:47:37,870 --> 01:47:41,370
Sir, you're madly in love with your wife.

1300
01:47:41,410 --> 01:47:44,120
In fact, yesterday,
you and your wife,

1301
01:47:44,160 --> 01:47:46,910
have had a nice,
romantic moment.

1302
01:47:48,950 --> 01:47:51,750
In that same mood,
you come down and,

1303
01:47:51,830 --> 01:47:53,410
call her "Ma"...

1304
01:47:53,450 --> 01:47:56,330
Oh! The previous scene was that?

1305
01:47:56,540 --> 01:47:58,040
You never told me that.

1306
01:48:00,910 --> 01:48:01,660
Go.

1307
01:48:20,950 --> 01:48:22,450
Ma...

1308
01:48:28,250 --> 01:48:30,450
Sir, this is sounding different...

1309
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:32,500
What do you mean different...

1310
01:48:32,540 --> 01:48:34,370
You only said it has to be romantic.

1311
01:48:34,660 --> 01:48:38,870
Sir, this is... kind of...
like that...

1312
01:48:41,750 --> 01:48:44,790
Please sir, let's do one more.

1313
01:49:00,290 --> 01:49:01,160
Ma...

1314
01:49:05,410 --> 01:49:07,410
Sir, there are no emotions in this.

1315
01:49:07,500 --> 01:49:09,040
Emotions aren't coming, correct?

1316
01:49:09,620 --> 01:49:10,660
Correct sir.

1317
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:12,750
You think I didn't know that.

1318
01:49:12,790 --> 01:49:14,410
Emotions won't come.

1319
01:49:17,370 --> 01:49:18,830
Hey! Kumar! Come here.

1320
01:49:20,500 --> 01:49:23,580
- What are Ayya's call sheet timings?
- Sir, from 9am to 6pm.

1321
01:49:23,620 --> 01:49:26,700
If it's a 9am call sheet,
and you keep the shot at 7am,

1322
01:49:26,790 --> 01:49:28,950
how wil he come?

1323
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:30,580
Call for a break, sir.

1324
01:49:37,540 --> 01:49:39,120
Serve, ma'am.

1325
01:49:39,160 --> 01:49:40,160
No, I don't want.

1326
01:49:40,200 --> 01:49:42,580
Please eat.
It's made out of Ghee.

1327
01:49:42,620 --> 01:49:44,500
You won't put on weight.

1328
01:49:44,540 --> 01:49:46,750
Just a little... a little...

1329
01:49:46,790 --> 01:49:47,700
Enough... enough...

1330
01:49:47,750 --> 01:49:49,290
Serve cashew.

1331
01:49:51,580 --> 01:49:53,330
Keep some for me.

1332
01:50:12,870 --> 01:50:14,410
Now explain clearly.

1333
01:50:15,080 --> 01:50:18,790
That's what sir, you will come down,
and affectionately...

1334
01:50:18,830 --> 01:50:21,080
Hey! Why you telling me.

1335
01:50:21,120 --> 01:50:22,500
Tell him, clearly.

1336
01:50:23,040 --> 01:50:24,410
To him...

1337
01:50:26,870 --> 01:50:31,200
That's what... you come down...
you look around...

1338
01:50:32,500 --> 01:50:37,040
You, call your wife 'Ma'...
affectionately, sir.

1339
01:50:37,870 --> 01:50:41,450
She too will come running,
and say lovingly, 'what dear?'.

1340
01:50:41,500 --> 01:50:42,540
That's all.

1341
01:50:44,660 --> 01:50:46,790
He would have understood. Go.

1342
01:50:58,910 --> 01:51:00,330
Ma...

1343
01:51:16,450 --> 01:51:18,080
Sir, any problem?

1344
01:51:19,290 --> 01:51:21,250
I over ate a bit.

1345
01:51:24,040 --> 01:51:25,540
Now you're okay sir?

1346
01:51:28,700 --> 01:51:30,450
Shall we do it once more?

1347
01:51:31,790 --> 01:51:33,120
Lets go.

1348
01:51:45,790 --> 01:51:46,660
Ma...

1349
01:51:50,160 --> 01:51:52,540
Sir, you went out from the frame.

1350
01:51:52,620 --> 01:51:54,080
I went out, is it?

1351
01:51:54,700 --> 01:51:56,450
Sir, that's the position.

1352
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:00,120
All this while,
I was doing it right.

1353
01:52:00,160 --> 01:52:02,540
Yes sir, now you went out .

1354
01:52:02,580 --> 01:52:04,540
Hey! Mark it.

1355
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:15,040
I think I got too carried away.

1356
01:52:23,200 --> 01:52:25,000
Let's do it once more.

1357
01:52:26,330 --> 01:52:27,790
One more.

1358
01:52:39,450 --> 01:52:40,450
Ma...

1359
01:52:41,700 --> 01:52:44,160
Sir, you looked at the mark.

1360
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:48,000
Without looking at the mark,
how can I stand on the mark?

1361
01:52:48,370 --> 01:52:50,160
Sir, the mark will be there,

1362
01:52:50,200 --> 01:52:52,160
but you shouldn't look at it sir.

1363
01:52:52,200 --> 01:52:54,700
What!!! The mark will be there,

1364
01:52:54,750 --> 01:52:57,910
I shouldn't see it,
but I have to stand on it!!!

1365
01:52:58,290 --> 01:52:59,410
Yes, sir.

1366
01:53:12,200 --> 01:53:13,580
Ma...

1367
01:53:18,080 --> 01:53:19,660
I looked at the mark is it?

1368
01:53:20,040 --> 01:53:22,040
I am coming sir.

1369
01:53:23,040 --> 01:53:24,040
Sir,

1370
01:53:24,410 --> 01:53:28,120
You looked at the mark,
at me and everyone else.

1371
01:53:28,120 --> 01:53:28,910
Is it?!

1372
01:53:28,950 --> 01:53:30,080
Yes, sir.

1373
01:53:30,790 --> 01:53:31,540
Show me.

1374
01:53:31,580 --> 01:53:32,450
Come, sir.

1375
01:53:32,750 --> 01:53:33,910
Playback.

1376
01:53:43,950 --> 01:53:45,370
Ma...

1377
01:53:52,410 --> 01:53:54,040
Okay, come.

1378
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:06,080
Why can't you go little away?

1379
01:54:06,120 --> 01:54:10,160
No sir, this will look good
only as a close up.

1380
01:54:33,370 --> 01:54:34,540
Ma...

1381
01:54:35,910 --> 01:54:37,290
Super sir.

1382
01:54:39,290 --> 01:54:41,450
Lets immediately go for a take.

1383
01:54:42,450 --> 01:54:43,620
What was this!!!

1384
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:47,450
This was just a rehearsal.
The camera wasn't rolling.

1385
01:54:47,500 --> 01:54:49,950
You weren't rolling?
What nonsense!!!

1386
01:54:51,830 --> 01:54:54,250
What were you doing behind
the camera,without rolling!!!

1387
01:54:54,290 --> 01:54:56,450
I wasn't asked to roll, sir.

1388
01:54:56,500 --> 01:54:59,000
Sir, no problem,
we can roll it now sir.

1389
01:54:59,040 --> 01:55:00,370
Lets do it, sir.

1390
01:55:00,500 --> 01:55:01,500
Roll camera.

1391
01:55:07,750 --> 01:55:09,080
Ma...

1392
01:55:18,620 --> 01:55:21,750
Sir, this sounds like something else.

1393
01:55:22,200 --> 01:55:23,120
I know.

1394
01:55:23,160 --> 01:55:26,540
When it came out well,
this guy did not roll.

1395
01:55:26,910 --> 01:55:28,500
Lets go once more.

1396
01:55:35,330 --> 01:55:36,200
Sir,

1397
01:55:36,910 --> 01:55:38,790
You have become very dull.

1398
01:55:38,870 --> 01:55:41,040
Let this shot be energetic.

1399
01:55:41,080 --> 01:55:42,040
Energetic?

1400
01:55:42,080 --> 01:55:43,120
Yes sir.

1401
01:55:43,160 --> 01:55:44,330
Okay, okay.

1402
01:55:53,120 --> 01:55:55,450
Hey! Wait!
Don't I have to get ready?

1403
01:55:55,500 --> 01:55:57,160
How can I do it immediately.

1404
01:56:15,950 --> 01:56:17,080
Amma...

1405
01:56:24,080 --> 01:56:27,290
Again you have come out
from the mark, sir.

1406
01:56:27,450 --> 01:56:29,540
Sir, stand in the "Ma" position.

1407
01:56:33,120 --> 01:56:34,790
Sir, and one more thing,

1408
01:56:34,870 --> 01:56:37,040
this sounds very childish.

1409
01:56:37,120 --> 01:56:38,160
Let it be more matured.

1410
01:56:38,580 --> 01:56:40,040
Matured is it?

1411
01:56:46,830 --> 01:56:47,790
Hey! Wait!

1412
01:56:59,870 --> 01:57:02,830
Sir, just take a look
at the mark properly.

1413
01:57:18,700 --> 01:57:19,830
Amma...

1414
01:57:21,950 --> 01:57:24,500
Sir, this was too much.

1415
01:57:24,580 --> 01:57:27,080
Bro! Again he went out of the frame.

1416
01:57:45,700 --> 01:57:47,700
Shoot something else today.

1417
01:57:47,790 --> 01:57:49,450
We will do this later.

1418
01:57:51,290 --> 01:57:53,700
What happened bro?
Did he fall down?

1419
01:57:53,910 --> 01:57:55,160
That's what I think.

1420
01:57:55,250 --> 01:57:56,580
I am not sure.

1421
01:58:04,160 --> 01:58:05,620
Sir, you called for me?

1422
01:58:05,660 --> 01:58:07,290
Tomorrow lets take no one else,

1423
01:58:07,330 --> 01:58:09,080
only you and the cameraman come.

1424
01:58:09,120 --> 01:58:10,000
I will come.

1425
01:58:10,040 --> 01:58:11,790
Shoot something with me and see.

1426
01:58:11,830 --> 01:58:12,870
Why sir?

1427
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:13,700
Nothing.

1428
01:58:14,330 --> 01:58:15,700
Lets meet tomorrow.

1429
01:58:16,450 --> 01:58:17,950
Go.

1430
01:58:33,780 --> 01:58:35,700
Greetings! Parasuraman.

1431
01:58:36,030 --> 01:58:38,070
Are you stepping out?

1432
01:58:38,650 --> 01:58:40,150
Thank god...

1433
01:58:43,110 --> 01:58:44,740
Ayya!!!

1434
01:58:45,740 --> 01:58:47,530
Shall I pray and come?

1435
01:59:00,280 --> 01:59:03,610
Nothing much Parasuraman,
I was passing by,

1436
01:59:03,700 --> 01:59:05,860
so I thought of seeing you.

1437
01:59:06,900 --> 01:59:08,150
Sit down.

1438
01:59:19,280 --> 01:59:21,110
Yesterday, after you left,

1439
01:59:21,150 --> 01:59:23,320
I sat and thought for a long while.

1440
01:59:23,360 --> 01:59:25,030
What you said was correct.

1441
01:59:25,240 --> 01:59:27,280
All these businessmen confused me.

1442
01:59:27,900 --> 01:59:30,110
That's why I was a little lost.

1443
01:59:30,320 --> 01:59:32,400
Ayya has carved a particular path,

1444
01:59:32,450 --> 01:59:35,110
to do the regular thing,
why is Ayya required!

1445
01:59:35,150 --> 01:59:36,400
Ayya's path is unique.

1446
01:59:36,450 --> 01:59:38,700
That's the reason for
which Ayya has come.

1447
01:59:38,740 --> 01:59:40,450
People like everything.

1448
01:59:40,490 --> 01:59:42,900
Just because people like Arrack,
can we make it?

1449
01:59:42,950 --> 01:59:44,990
We can only do,
what is correct.

1450
01:59:45,030 --> 01:59:47,280
Let's not use the fights we shot.

1451
01:59:47,320 --> 01:59:50,070
I've also asked them
to cancel the song shoot.

1452
01:59:50,110 --> 01:59:52,110
Yesterday, after the way
I spoke to you,

1453
01:59:52,150 --> 01:59:53,570
I felt really bad.

1454
01:59:53,650 --> 01:59:55,900
That's why I came to say sorry.

1455
02:00:00,490 --> 02:00:03,280
Due to the tension at shoot,
I just spoke something.

1456
02:00:03,320 --> 02:00:05,200
Please don't take it to heart.

1457
02:00:05,240 --> 02:00:07,610
I couldn't sleep whole of last night.

1458
02:00:07,610 --> 02:00:10,070
Today, Ayya's dates are with us isn't it?

1459
02:00:10,110 --> 02:00:11,070
Yes.

1460
02:00:12,200 --> 02:00:14,030
No. He never came.

1461
02:00:14,070 --> 02:00:16,150
Have you given dates to
any other film?

1462
02:00:16,200 --> 02:00:18,400
You said there was some patchwork.

1463
02:00:18,530 --> 02:00:21,200
No, today it is your film.

1464
02:00:21,400 --> 02:00:22,280
Is it?

1465
02:00:22,900 --> 02:00:25,900
Generally, if he gives his word,
he will come, is it not?

1466
02:00:25,950 --> 02:00:30,030
Till date, he has never disappeared
on the dates you promised, isn't it?

1467
02:00:30,070 --> 02:00:31,780
No, he will come.

1468
02:00:32,110 --> 02:00:33,490
Just once...

1469
02:00:33,780 --> 02:00:35,530
Yes, I was told.

1470
02:00:35,820 --> 02:00:38,030
He didn't come during
Saravanan's shooting.

1471
02:00:38,070 --> 02:00:40,650
Similarly, has Ayya misunderstood now?

1472
02:00:42,150 --> 02:00:43,320
I don't know?

1473
02:00:44,110 --> 02:00:45,400
I did it by mistake.

1474
02:00:45,530 --> 02:00:46,900
I am human too.

1475
02:00:46,950 --> 02:00:49,240
Isn't it natural to make mistakes?

1476
02:00:49,280 --> 02:00:50,530
I did it by mistake.

1477
02:00:50,570 --> 02:00:54,110
And I realized that. I have
apologized to you as well.

1478
02:00:54,150 --> 02:00:56,280
Keeping that in mind...

1479
02:00:59,240 --> 02:01:01,610
Why aren't you saying anything?

1480
02:01:03,150 --> 02:01:04,240
What can I say?

1481
02:01:12,280 --> 02:01:14,990
If I have made any mistake,
please forgive me.

1482
02:01:15,110 --> 02:01:18,360
I will make the film,
exactly like how I told him.

1483
02:01:18,400 --> 02:01:20,280
Please don't test me.

1484
02:01:20,320 --> 02:01:22,360
I won't be able to bear it.

1485
02:01:30,950 --> 02:01:34,320
I don't believe in God,
I believe in Ayya.

1486
02:01:34,400 --> 02:01:35,950
He's like my God.

1487
02:01:36,030 --> 02:01:38,860
He will definitely come.
I have faith.

1488
02:01:40,900 --> 02:01:42,200
Please take care.

1489
02:02:16,900 --> 02:02:19,700
" A cock is spreading it's
feathers like a peacock."

1490
02:02:19,740 --> 02:02:20,950
" Trying to win over the universe."

1491
02:02:20,990 --> 02:02:22,280
" By doing the dance."

1492
02:02:22,320 --> 02:02:23,610
" Do stand and watch!"

1493
02:02:23,650 --> 02:02:24,900
" The Ant hill imagines itself,"

1494
02:02:24,950 --> 02:02:26,200
" to be a temple tower."

1495
02:02:26,240 --> 02:02:27,490
" And unveils the drama."

1496
02:02:27,530 --> 02:02:28,740
" Please do listen!"

1497
02:02:28,780 --> 02:02:30,280
" The kite with a broken thread,"

1498
02:02:30,320 --> 02:02:31,570
" is trying hard to reach the skies."

1499
02:02:31,610 --> 02:02:32,990
" This disgusting, disgraceful act..."

1500
02:02:33,030 --> 02:02:34,320
" Should be spoken about!"

1501
02:02:34,360 --> 02:02:35,610
" The time belongs to me,"

1502
02:02:35,650 --> 02:02:36,950
" says, the egoistic man."

1503
02:02:36,990 --> 02:02:38,240
" Though his fate is doomed,"

1504
02:02:38,280 --> 02:02:39,360
" he's brash!"

1505
02:02:39,400 --> 02:02:42,030
" Even with the greasepaint on."

1506
02:02:42,070 --> 02:02:43,610
" A gooseberry,"

1507
02:02:43,650 --> 02:02:45,860
" can't turn into an apple!"

1508
02:02:46,030 --> 02:02:48,110
" A needle can't transform,"

1509
02:02:48,150 --> 02:02:50,320
" into a sword!"

1510
02:02:52,700 --> 02:02:54,240
What should I do now?

1511
02:02:54,650 --> 02:02:57,150
Just walk straight into the sea, sir.

1512
02:02:57,650 --> 02:02:58,950
" A cock is spreading it's
feathers like a peacock."

1513
02:02:58,990 --> 02:03:00,200
" Trying to win over the universe."

1514
02:03:00,240 --> 02:03:01,570
" By doing the dance."

1515
02:03:01,610 --> 02:03:02,860
" Do stand and watch!"

1516
02:03:02,900 --> 02:03:04,320
" The Ant hill imagines itself,"

1517
02:03:04,360 --> 02:03:05,610
" to be a temple tower."

1518
02:03:05,650 --> 02:03:06,990
" And unveils the drama."

1519
02:03:07,030 --> 02:03:08,240
" Please do listen!"

1520
02:03:08,280 --> 02:03:09,530
" The kite with a broken thread,"

1521
02:03:09,570 --> 02:03:10,950

02:03:12,320 --> 02:03:13,490

02:03:14,950 --> 02:03:16,280
" says, the egoistic man."

1526
02:03:16,320 --> 02:03:17,570
" Though his fate is doomed,"

1527
02:03:17,610 --> 02:03:19,860
" he's brash!"

1528
02:03:27,280 --> 02:03:30,280
Sir, on action, turn around
looking very angry.

1529
02:03:35,650 --> 02:03:37,200
" The Helicopter flower,"

1530
02:03:37,240 --> 02:03:39,070
" shouldn't imagine,"

1531
02:03:39,110 --> 02:03:40,780
" itself to be a Rose!"

1532
02:03:40,820 --> 02:03:42,700
" Without the rope,"

1533
02:03:42,740 --> 02:03:44,400
" no grand swing,"

1534
02:03:44,450 --> 02:03:46,240
" can move!"

1535
02:03:51,780 --> 02:03:52,650
Sir,

1536
02:03:53,530 --> 02:03:55,070
everything is wrong.

1537
02:03:57,490 --> 02:03:58,450
Over...

1538
02:03:58,490 --> 02:03:59,820
Everything's over.

1539
02:03:59,820 --> 02:04:01,280
Why sir?

1540
02:04:01,280 --> 02:04:03,610
That man, Ayya, is not coming
for the past two days.

1541
02:04:03,650 --> 02:04:06,070
Oh! What do we do now, sir?

1542
02:04:06,530 --> 02:04:07,740
What to do...

1543
02:04:07,780 --> 02:04:10,570
Lets put the faith in God.
I'll do it myself.

1544
02:04:11,780 --> 02:04:13,200
" When a lowlife snuff,"

1545
02:04:13,240 --> 02:04:14,530
" blames the ceramic."

1546
02:04:14,570 --> 02:04:17,070
" The world will never agree."

1547
02:04:17,110 --> 02:04:18,740
" A chemical less mirror,"

1548
02:04:18,780 --> 02:04:22,450
" cannot reflect,
our face!"

1549
02:04:22,490 --> 02:04:24,950
" Once the water has,
all dried up."

1550
02:04:24,990 --> 02:04:27,740
" The fish will never,
want to swim!"

1551
02:04:27,780 --> 02:04:30,780
" Once flies have settled,
on rotten food."

1552
02:04:30,820 --> 02:04:33,200
" You shouldn't sell it."

1553
02:04:33,240 --> 02:04:36,650
" No one makes it on their own..."

1554
02:04:36,700 --> 02:04:39,700
" Don't grow horns..."

1555
02:04:39,740 --> 02:04:41,780
" From your roots,"

1556
02:04:41,820 --> 02:04:43,990
" never ever distance yourself!"

1557
02:04:44,650 --> 02:04:46,740
Sir, let's not do anything else,

1558
02:04:46,780 --> 02:04:49,780
just simply stand and keep
looking, that's enough.

1559
02:04:49,780 --> 02:04:51,110
" A cock is spreading it's
feathers like a peacock."

1560
02:04:51,150 --> 02:04:52,490
" Trying to win over the universe."

1561
02:04:52,530 --> 02:04:53,780
" By doing the dance."

1562
02:04:53,820 --> 02:04:55,070
" Do stand and watch!"

1563

" The Ant hill imagines itself,"

1564
02:04:56,490 --> 02:04:57,740
" to be a temple tower."

1565
02:04:57,780 --> 02:04:59,070
" And unveils the drama."

1566
02:04:59,110 --> 02:05:00,360
" Please do listen!"

1567
02:05:00,400 --> 02:05:01,820
" The kite with a broken thread,"

1568
02:05:01,860 --> 02:05:03,110
" is trying hard to reach the skies."

1569
02:05:03,150 --> 02:05:04,400
" This disgusting, disgraceful act,"

1570
02:05:04,450 --> 02:05:05,740
" should be spoken about!"

1571
02:05:05,780 --> 02:05:07,070
" The time belongs to me,"

1572
02:05:07,110 --> 02:05:08,450
" says, the egoistic man."

1573
02:05:08,490 --> 02:05:10,780
" Though his fate is doomed,"

1574
02:05:10,820 --> 02:05:13,400
" he's brash!"

1575
02:05:13,900 --> 02:05:18,150
Just sit here, and look at the sea.
That's enough.

1576
02:05:26,320 --> 02:05:29,570
Sir, move a little forward and sit.

1577
02:05:39,900 --> 02:05:40,820
Enough sir,

1578
02:05:41,030 --> 02:05:42,990
there's a serious problem.

1579
02:05:43,070 --> 02:05:45,150
Somehow try to make him come.

1580
02:05:47,280 --> 02:05:48,780
Hey! Give me my phone.

1581
02:05:59,900 --> 02:06:01,240
Look here, Parasuraman...

1582
02:06:01,280 --> 02:06:04,570
This is wrong. Then this problem
will take a different route.

1583
02:06:04,610 --> 02:06:06,240
You will have to face it.

1584
02:06:06,280 --> 02:06:07,740
What do you think of yourself .

1585
02:06:08,240 --> 02:06:09,530
Look here, sir,

1586
02:06:09,820 --> 02:06:12,150
I have spoken to you about this before.

1587
02:06:12,320 --> 02:06:15,570
All of you say one thing,
and then do one thing.

1588
02:06:15,820 --> 02:06:17,990
You did not film the story you told.

1589
02:06:18,030 --> 02:06:19,650
Why you going on saying that...

1590
02:06:19,700 --> 02:06:21,450
Now, What's the solution to this?

1591
02:06:21,610 --> 02:06:23,530
We will return your money, sir.

1592
02:06:23,530 --> 02:06:24,990
What? Returning the money...?

1593
02:06:25,030 --> 02:06:27,530
Will everything be fine,
if the money is returned?

1594
02:06:27,570 --> 02:06:30,450
Do you know how much money
I've spent so far on this film?

1595
02:06:30,490 --> 02:06:32,700
More than half the film is done.

1596
02:06:32,740 --> 02:06:36,030
If he doesn't come now,
how will I complete the film?

1597
02:06:36,530 --> 02:06:38,030
I don't care about anything.

1598
02:06:38,030 --> 02:06:39,860
After diwali I am
fixing a schedule.

1599
02:06:39,900 --> 02:06:41,110
He has to come and act.

1600
02:06:41,150 --> 02:06:42,450
If he doesn't come,

1601
02:06:42,450 --> 02:06:45,570
just watch, what I do to all of you!

1602
02:06:45,610 --> 02:06:47,900
Playing the fool with me!

1603
02:07:01,320 --> 02:07:03,570
After he died,
where did he first act?

1604
02:07:03,610 --> 02:07:04,990
In the auditorium,
is it not?

1605
02:07:05,030 --> 02:07:05,900
Yes, sir.

1606
02:07:06,110 --> 02:07:07,860
One of you go sit there.

1607
02:07:07,900 --> 02:07:09,490
No, you itself go.

1608
02:07:09,530 --> 02:07:11,950
If anyone acts
very well over there,

1609
02:07:11,990 --> 02:07:14,610
or you hear them, talking
about something like that,

1610
02:07:14,650 --> 02:07:15,650
immediately call me.

1611
02:07:15,700 --> 02:07:16,450
Sure sir.

1612
02:07:16,490 --> 02:07:19,610
I want to question that
person, right, left and centre!

1613
02:07:20,280 --> 02:07:23,820
When have you scheduled
Ayya's patchwork?

1614
02:07:23,860 --> 02:07:25,740
Today we are shooting the patchwork.

1615
02:07:25,780 --> 02:07:27,150
How is he acting?

1616
02:07:27,650 --> 02:07:29,990
He hasn't come to act at all!

1617
02:07:30,490 --> 02:07:33,200
That's why I had called
Parasuraman, to find out.

1618
02:07:33,240 --> 02:07:34,820
He says he doesn't know!

1619
02:07:35,200 --> 02:07:36,780
Hasn't he come there also?

1620
02:07:36,990 --> 02:07:38,820
Then what are you doing?

1621
02:07:39,070 --> 02:07:40,360
What to do...

1622
02:07:40,400 --> 02:07:42,320
We had to finish yesterday itself.

1623
02:07:42,360 --> 02:07:43,950
It's just patchwork.

1624
02:07:44,200 --> 02:07:45,740
So we are somehow managing.

1625
02:07:46,530 --> 02:07:47,740
Is it?

1626
02:07:49,570 --> 02:07:51,150
Okay, I will call later.

1627
02:07:57,360 --> 02:07:58,450
Tell me, sir.

1628
02:07:58,650 --> 02:08:00,200
When is your photo shoot?

1629
02:08:00,400 --> 02:08:01,530
Tomorrow, sir.

1630
02:08:01,900 --> 02:08:03,200
Tomorrow...

1631
02:08:03,240 --> 02:08:04,450
Where is it happening?

1632
02:08:04,450 --> 02:08:06,200
At the Set Fire Studio
in Nungambakkam.

1633
02:08:06,240 --> 02:08:07,740
Oh! You have kept it there?

1634
02:08:07,740 --> 02:08:08,400
Why sir?

1635
02:08:08,400 --> 02:08:10,530
Nothing... nothing...
go ahead and do it.

1636
02:08:10,570 --> 02:08:11,570
Is it a big set ?

1637
02:08:11,570 --> 02:08:12,610
Yes sir.

1638
02:08:12,610 --> 02:08:14,150
Have you spent a lot?

1639
02:08:14,320 --> 02:08:15,400
Yes...Yes... sir.

1640
02:08:15,780 --> 02:08:17,150
Go ahead... go ahead...

1641
02:08:26,990 --> 02:08:29,860
That boy has applied his makeup
and is waiting for two hours.

1642
02:08:29,900 --> 02:08:31,400
The heroine is getting annoyed.

1643
02:08:31,450 --> 02:08:33,280
When will Ayya, come?

1644
02:08:34,360 --> 02:08:35,400
I don't know.

1645
02:08:35,610 --> 02:08:37,150
What? You don't know?

1646
02:08:48,740 --> 02:08:50,700
The best thing to do is,
you become an actor.

1647
02:08:50,740 --> 02:08:51,860
Don't remain a producer.

1648
02:08:51,950 --> 02:08:52,900
You can be in peace.

1649
02:08:52,950 --> 02:08:54,740
They will come and give you
snacks and you can eat.

1650
02:08:54,740 --> 02:08:56,240
All the politicians are acting.

1651
02:08:56,280 --> 02:08:57,900
All the actors are
becoming politicians.

1652
02:08:57,900 --> 02:08:58,950
Excuse me.

1653
02:08:59,320 --> 02:09:01,030
What's the solution
to this problem?

1654
02:09:03,490 --> 02:09:06,490
This Ayya, has not been coming
to the shoot for many days.

1655
02:09:06,530 --> 02:09:09,780
Hoping he will come, how long
can I keep going to shoot?

1656
02:09:09,820 --> 02:09:11,070
I have tried everything...

1657
02:09:11,320 --> 02:09:13,030
Suddenly he is doing this.

1658
02:09:13,320 --> 02:09:14,650
Not just in my film.

1659
02:09:14,700 --> 02:09:18,070
He hasn't turned up in
either of their films as well.

1660
02:09:18,950 --> 02:09:21,860
Hey! Did you come to
eat these snacks?

1661
02:09:24,990 --> 02:09:26,950
Okay, this is just patchwork.

1662
02:09:27,030 --> 02:09:29,200
He shelved it,
as they had begun.

1663
02:09:29,240 --> 02:09:31,280
Just like this, another film
also has been shelved.

1664
02:09:31,320 --> 02:09:32,820
All this is fine, sir.

1665
02:09:32,820 --> 02:09:35,280
Mine, is more than half way through.

1666
02:09:35,320 --> 02:09:36,990
Suddenly if he doesn't
come, what can I do?

1667
02:09:37,030 --> 02:09:40,320
Hey! how can you consider this as
an issue, and bring it to the council?

1668
02:09:40,360 --> 02:09:41,650
Why shouldn't I bring it?

1669
02:09:41,700 --> 02:09:43,320
Then how can I complete my film?

1670
02:09:43,360 --> 02:09:46,150
One man is dead,
apparently his soul is acting,

1671
02:09:46,200 --> 02:09:48,950
and with that soul all of you
will keep on making films,

1672
02:09:48,990 --> 02:09:50,400
and all those films
will become big hits!

1673
02:09:50,450 --> 02:09:53,400
And now that soul has run away,
while acting in a film!

1674
02:09:53,450 --> 02:09:56,070
Hey! To complete a film
with a living actor,

1675
02:09:56,110 --> 02:09:57,530
itself, we get completely exhausted.

1676
02:09:57,570 --> 02:09:59,950
Now where to go look for a soul,
which has run away!

1677
02:09:59,990 --> 02:10:00,990
Why, didn't you believe it?

1678
02:10:01,030 --> 02:10:03,780
Did you not narrate a story
and ask for his dates?

1679
02:10:03,820 --> 02:10:06,530
My good fortune, that man
did not like my story.

1680
02:10:06,570 --> 02:10:08,780
I escaped, you got caught!

1681
02:10:11,320 --> 02:10:13,030
He liked only your story.

1682
02:10:13,070 --> 02:10:16,900
To add to that, you found it apt for you
and acted as the hero!

1683
02:10:17,320 --> 02:10:19,400
I wonder who cast their evil eyes!

1684
02:10:20,950 --> 02:10:22,490
Look here Dhanapal...

1685
02:10:22,490 --> 02:10:25,150
That man, when alive itself
was very stubborn.

1686
02:10:25,200 --> 02:10:27,700
During my father's days when we
asked him, he refused to come and act.

1687
02:10:27,740 --> 02:10:30,240
I don't think it's possible
to call that soul,

1688
02:10:30,280 --> 02:10:31,780
and complete your film.

1689
02:10:31,820 --> 02:10:33,950
What can we do with a dead man!

1690
02:10:33,990 --> 02:10:36,740
No one in the council
knows any such magic.

1691
02:10:36,780 --> 02:10:38,030
Please try and understand.

1692
02:10:38,070 --> 02:10:39,070
Dhanapal...

1693
02:10:39,360 --> 02:10:41,570
You have so many years
of experience in cinema.

1694
02:10:41,610 --> 02:10:43,820
Won't you complete this film!

1695
02:10:43,860 --> 02:10:47,990
Being confident that Ayya will perform,
I had borrowed a lot of money.

1696
02:10:48,030 --> 02:10:50,990
Since I am acting as a
hero for the first time,

1697
02:10:51,030 --> 02:10:52,150
I spent a lot on the film.

1698
02:10:52,200 --> 02:10:53,530
If anything goes wrong,

1699
02:10:53,570 --> 02:10:55,650
the loan sharks will be at my neck!!!

1700
02:10:55,650 --> 02:10:57,820
Even if the King's rule doesn't exist,

1701
02:10:57,860 --> 02:10:59,950
the desire to be a King still exists!

1702
02:10:59,990 --> 02:11:01,280
Even now you can see,

1703
02:11:01,280 --> 02:11:02,990
they present a grand sword,

1704
02:11:03,030 --> 02:11:04,740
and they crown him!

1705
02:11:04,780 --> 02:11:07,150
Such thoughts ruin a man's duty!

1706
02:11:07,200 --> 02:11:07,990
He too...

1707
02:11:08,030 --> 02:11:10,320
Is this a deserted land?

1708
02:11:10,740 --> 02:11:13,650
Who will come to
listen to my commands?

1709
02:11:13,740 --> 02:11:16,570
Amidst the thick bamboo bushes,

1710
02:11:17,530 --> 02:11:20,860
I can hear the breathing of the snake.

1711
02:11:20,990 --> 02:11:22,900
It's scorching hot!

1712
02:11:23,990 --> 02:11:26,900
I am dying of a parched throat.

1713
02:11:27,400 --> 02:11:30,820
I am not scared of anything
that chases me!

1714
02:11:31,700 --> 02:11:34,240
I don't have any life left to lose!

1715
02:11:36,490 --> 02:11:38,030
Brother!

1716
02:11:38,990 --> 02:11:40,360
I made a mistake!

1717
02:11:41,700 --> 02:11:46,320
He would have at least
stayed on in this auditorium.

1718
02:11:47,280 --> 02:11:48,450
Did I...

1719
02:11:50,950 --> 02:11:52,990
Value money more!

1720
02:11:53,030 --> 02:11:55,490
No... no... nothing like that.

1721
02:12:07,200 --> 02:12:08,490
Hello, sir.

1722
02:12:08,530 --> 02:12:10,030
Hey! What happenend?

1723
02:12:10,240 --> 02:12:12,900
Sir, everyone's acting very well.

1724
02:12:12,950 --> 02:12:14,280
It's superb!

1725
02:12:14,320 --> 02:12:17,490
We can use any of them in
our films in the future, sir.

1726
02:12:17,530 --> 02:12:19,490
Suggestion is it? Idiot!

1727
02:12:19,530 --> 02:12:20,780
Did Ayya come there or not?

1728
02:12:20,820 --> 02:12:23,530
Sir, I don't know that.

1729
02:12:23,570 --> 02:12:26,990
Even Parasuraman sir,
is seated here, looking sad.

1730
02:12:27,030 --> 02:12:29,400
Won't he have been happy
if Ayya had come?

1731
02:12:30,610 --> 02:12:31,740
Okay.

1732
02:12:36,610 --> 02:12:40,450
When everything shook in fear,
I too stood shivering!

1733
02:12:40,950 --> 02:12:43,990
I slept, as the foxes were howling!

1734
02:12:44,320 --> 02:12:47,820
I walked the same path
as the snake's crawl!

1735
02:12:51,820 --> 02:12:54,490
"For the past few days,
actor Ayya. Aadimoolam,"

1736
02:12:54,530 --> 02:12:56,860
"has not attended any of
his film shootings."

1737
02:12:56,900 --> 02:13:01,280
"Therefore the film units have given
a complaint to the Producers council."

1738
02:13:01,320 --> 02:13:04,150
"All the films, that he had
agreed to do,"

1739
02:13:04,200 --> 02:13:05,400
"have been stalled."

1740
02:13:05,450 --> 02:13:08,280
"This comes as a rude shock
to all Ayya's fans."

1741
02:13:09,900 --> 02:13:12,200
Greetings sir! I am Thyagu speaking!

1742
02:13:12,700 --> 02:13:15,030
All what I heard, is it true?

1743
02:13:19,280 --> 02:13:21,780
Is Ayya coming on stage?

1744
02:13:28,240 --> 02:13:30,990
Okay sir, I will come and see you.

1745
02:14:06,360 --> 02:14:10,110
"Ayya Aadhimoolam's soul has disappeared."

1746
02:14:18,530 --> 02:14:21,150
"The late Ayya. Aadhimoolam,
passes away again."

1747
02:14:21,200 --> 02:14:23,900
"Ayya. Aadhimoolam's soul
has suddenly disappeared."

1748
02:14:23,950 --> 02:14:27,110
"Ayya. Aadhimoolam's
soul disappeared."

1749
02:14:27,650 --> 02:14:30,280
"Once again the death of
Ayya. Aadhimoolam."

1750
02:14:41,110 --> 02:14:44,950
How are you so sure that
Ayya's soul has disappeared?

1751
02:14:47,650 --> 02:14:49,990
For the past two to three months,

1752
02:14:50,030 --> 02:14:52,320
Ayya has not come in
any of the films.

1753
02:14:54,320 --> 02:14:56,820
Not just in films,

1754
02:14:57,820 --> 02:15:01,700
he has not come in any of
the plays we have staged.

1755
02:15:03,070 --> 02:15:05,400
We are slowly losing hope.

1756
02:15:06,570 --> 02:15:07,950
It's frightening.

1757
02:15:08,860 --> 02:15:10,490
To think that,

1758
02:15:10,530 --> 02:15:13,360
Ayya, has left us and gone forever.

1759
02:15:14,610 --> 02:15:17,240
What is the reason for his
disappearance, forever?

1760
02:15:17,740 --> 02:15:21,530
Please. Lets not talk about
all that now.

1761
02:15:24,200 --> 02:15:27,030
Regarding the demise of Ayya,

1762
02:15:27,070 --> 02:15:30,280
lets see what the fans have to say.

1763
02:15:30,280 --> 02:15:33,200
Look here, he is a man who came
to act even after his death,

1764
02:15:33,240 --> 02:15:35,610
he hasn't gone anywhere,
he is around here, somewhere.

1765
02:15:35,650 --> 02:15:36,990
We won't believe anyone.

1766
02:15:37,030 --> 02:15:39,280
There is a reason why a
dead man came back to act.

1767
02:15:39,320 --> 02:15:41,360
Likewise there should be a
reason for why he disappeared.

1768
02:15:41,400 --> 02:15:43,240
Imagine if this is the
situation for a soul.

1769
02:15:43,280 --> 02:15:44,900
What could be our situation?

1770
02:15:44,950 --> 02:15:46,900
If he has really disappeared,

1771
02:15:46,950 --> 02:15:48,400
then those responsible for that,

1772
02:15:48,450 --> 02:15:50,150
will have to face
the consequences.

1773
02:15:50,200 --> 02:15:52,450
If it's true that he as left,
like everyone's saying,

1774
02:15:52,490 --> 02:15:55,110
there is definitely a reason.
We have to find out that.

1775
02:15:55,150 --> 02:15:56,700
For the past few years,

1776
02:15:56,740 --> 02:15:58,700
Ayya's soul which has
been acting in films,

1777
02:15:58,740 --> 02:15:59,900
has suddenly disappeared.

1778
02:15:59,950 --> 02:16:01,360
How... and... Why?

1779
02:16:01,780 --> 02:16:03,820
Sir, what's your opinion on this?

1780
02:16:05,490 --> 02:16:07,450
I was really astonished,

1781
02:16:07,490 --> 02:16:09,360
when I heard that, the legendary,

1782
02:16:09,400 --> 02:16:10,700
theatre artiste Aadhimoolam Ayya,

1783
02:16:10,740 --> 02:16:12,780
was acting even after his demise.

1784
02:16:12,820 --> 02:16:14,900
I have seen all his films.

1785
02:16:14,950 --> 02:16:16,820
I have liked all those films.

1786
02:16:16,860 --> 02:16:20,360
Apart from the fact that he has
disappeared or not disappeared,

1787
02:16:20,400 --> 02:16:21,990
this is his wish, sir.

1788
02:16:22,280 --> 02:16:24,570
He wished to act,

1789
02:16:24,780 --> 02:16:27,150
and that was continued by his soul.

1790
02:16:27,200 --> 02:16:28,570
If he's not acting now,

1791
02:16:28,610 --> 02:16:30,450
doesn't it mean,
he wishes not to?

1792
02:16:30,490 --> 02:16:34,820
I wasn't surprised, that Ayya
had come to act in cinema.

1793
02:16:34,900 --> 02:16:38,700
How they allowed him survive in
cinema for the past 4 years,

1794
02:16:38,740 --> 02:16:40,860
that's what surprised
and shocked me.

1795
02:16:40,900 --> 02:16:42,240
What has happened today,

1796
02:16:42,280 --> 02:16:44,030
I expected this to happen,
long back.

1797
02:16:44,070 --> 02:16:46,030
My worry is that,
it has happened,

1798
02:16:46,070 --> 02:16:48,200
just the way I expected it.

1799
02:16:48,240 --> 02:16:50,610
So, do you think the reason for
Ayya's disappearance,

1800
02:16:50,650 --> 02:16:52,950
is the system of the film industry?

1801
02:16:52,990 --> 02:16:55,490
Nothing to think about Manoj,
that is the truth.

1802
02:16:55,530 --> 02:16:57,530
That's more or less how the system
has been for a long time.

1803
02:16:57,570 --> 02:16:59,150
Each person before
entering this industry,

1804
02:16:59,200 --> 02:17:00,780
comes with big dreams
of becoming like,

1805
02:17:00,820 --> 02:17:01,860
Akira Kurosawa...
Satyajit Ray.

1806
02:17:01,900 --> 02:17:03,740
They come with immense
passion for the art.

1807
02:17:03,780 --> 02:17:04,990
After they come here,

1808
02:17:05,030 --> 02:17:08,450
to safeguard their own art,
itself is a huge struggle.

1809
02:17:08,490 --> 02:17:11,530
To be very frank, the man who says
that cinema is an art form,

1810
02:17:11,570 --> 02:17:12,860
will be the biggest idiot today!

1811
02:17:12,900 --> 02:17:16,200
The word art has literally
become a taboo, long ago!

1812
02:17:16,240 --> 02:17:19,650
But sir, isn't cinema not just
an art but also a business?

1813
02:17:19,700 --> 02:17:23,450
Sir, not just cinema, today there is
no field without the business aspect .

1814
02:17:23,490 --> 02:17:25,490
That to cinema is a
popular art form.

1815
02:17:25,530 --> 02:17:27,240
It's one where people
come to theatres,

1816
02:17:27,280 --> 02:17:28,280
pay for it and celebrate it.

1817
02:17:28,320 --> 02:17:29,360
It's a humongous art form!!!

1818
02:17:29,400 --> 02:17:31,950
Just because they come to
theatres and buy tickets,

1819
02:17:31,990 --> 02:17:33,320
why are we assuming
that people's,

1820
02:17:33,360 --> 02:17:34,450
artistic standards are low?

1821
02:17:34,490 --> 02:17:36,610
Why should we degrade
their artistic intelligence?

1822
02:17:36,650 --> 02:17:38,110
Just take Ayya for example.

1823
02:17:38,150 --> 02:17:39,360
His soul came to act.

1824
02:17:39,400 --> 02:17:41,110
He was acting for, four years.

1825
02:17:41,150 --> 02:17:42,820
You think he came to act without,
the need for money?

1826
02:17:42,860 --> 02:17:44,320
Definitely he would have
needed money.

1827
02:17:44,360 --> 02:17:45,700
Just because he needed money,

1828
02:17:45,740 --> 02:17:47,450
they did not make any
inferior movies.

1829
02:17:47,490 --> 02:17:49,860
The movies were good
and they made money.

1830
02:17:49,900 --> 02:17:51,150
The problem is, the fact that,

1831
02:17:51,200 --> 02:17:53,320
good intentions, good art,
and good films,

1832
02:17:53,360 --> 02:17:54,610
will be accepted by the people,

1833
02:17:54,650 --> 02:17:56,740
is not accepted by the system.

1834
02:17:56,780 --> 02:17:58,360
To be frank sir, over here,

1835
02:17:58,400 --> 02:18:01,490
they are literally killing art and
the feelings of an artiste.

1836
02:18:01,530 --> 02:18:04,280
The killing of people
alone is not murder,

1837
02:18:04,320 --> 02:18:07,030
even the killing of one's
feelings is also murder.

1838
02:18:07,070 --> 02:18:09,320
One good thing
that has happened,

1839
02:18:09,360 --> 02:18:12,450
is that, such murders have
been continuously happening.

1840
02:18:12,490 --> 02:18:14,780
Now because of the
disappearance of Ayya's soul,

1841
02:18:14,820 --> 02:18:17,280
it has come out
in the open now.

1842
02:18:17,360 --> 02:18:18,990
So is this a murder?

1843
02:18:19,070 --> 02:18:21,530
If its a murder,
then how did it happen?

1844
02:18:21,570 --> 02:18:23,070
Who's the reason for it?

1845
02:18:43,820 --> 02:18:44,780
Who is that?

1846
02:18:44,900 --> 02:18:47,110
Sir, it's me Kumar.

1847
02:18:47,530 --> 02:18:48,570
What is it?

1848
02:18:48,780 --> 02:18:51,490
Sir, it's an important issue,
open the door.

1849
02:18:51,530 --> 02:18:53,530
I am having bath.
You go, I will come.

1850
02:18:53,530 --> 02:18:55,700
Sir, it's very urgent.

1851
02:18:55,700 --> 02:18:58,740
Hey! Because of that
can I just walk out like this?

1852
02:18:58,900 --> 02:18:59,820
Go, I'll come.

1853
02:18:59,820 --> 02:19:01,740
At least switch on the TV
and watch, sir.

1854
02:19:01,780 --> 02:19:03,900
All the news channels
are carrying news on you.

1855
02:19:04,610 --> 02:19:06,150
About me?

1856
02:19:21,450 --> 02:19:22,900
"News has just come in, that,"

1857
02:19:22,950 --> 02:19:24,400
"a person named Mahesh,"

1858
02:19:24,450 --> 02:19:27,610
"has accused, well known film
producer and debutant actor,"

1859
02:19:27,650 --> 02:19:30,400
"Dhanapal, as the man who
has killed Ayya's soul."

1860
02:19:30,450 --> 02:19:33,530
"He has filed a case against
him, in the court today!"

1861
02:19:33,570 --> 02:19:35,530
"The fact that Ayya,
last appeared,"

1862
02:19:35,570 --> 02:19:37,570
"in the film 'Don't Leave Me',"

1863
02:19:37,610 --> 02:19:40,450
"was produced by Dhanapal,
is to be noted."

1864
02:19:47,360 --> 02:19:48,240
Hey!!!

1865
02:19:56,320 --> 02:19:57,950
Sir... sir... am slipping...

1866
02:20:34,240 --> 02:20:35,070
Get up.

1867
02:20:36,860 --> 02:20:38,070
What nonsense is this?

1868
02:20:38,110 --> 02:20:39,110
When did I kill him?

1869
02:20:39,150 --> 02:20:40,610
That man was already dead.

1870
02:20:40,650 --> 02:20:42,610
No sir, he was dead,

1871
02:20:42,650 --> 02:20:44,490
but his soul was alive.

1872
02:20:44,610 --> 02:20:47,200
They are saying,
you have killed that.

1873
02:20:49,610 --> 02:20:51,780
Go down and wait in my office.

1874
02:21:13,570 --> 02:21:15,490
Hello! Dhanapal sir.
How are you?

1875
02:21:15,530 --> 02:21:17,400
I thought of calling you myself.

1876
02:21:17,450 --> 02:21:18,450
I just heard the news.

1877
02:21:18,490 --> 02:21:20,110
Then, how can I be fine.

1878
02:21:20,150 --> 02:21:20,700
Sir...

1879
02:21:22,320 --> 02:21:23,360
What now?

1880
02:21:23,400 --> 02:21:25,320
Sir, all the people
from the media,

1881
02:21:25,360 --> 02:21:26,900
are waiting outside,
to meet you.

1882
02:21:26,950 --> 02:21:28,490
What? Media?

1883
02:21:28,530 --> 02:21:29,570
Yes, sir.

1884
02:21:30,570 --> 02:21:32,950
Sir, the people from
the media are here.

1885
02:21:33,030 --> 02:21:34,030
What should I do now?

1886
02:21:34,820 --> 02:21:35,990
Is it?

1887
02:21:36,610 --> 02:21:38,320
You go and meet
the media sir.

1888
02:21:38,400 --> 02:21:39,570
I am coming there now,

1889
02:21:39,610 --> 02:21:40,700
we can discuss
everything else.

1890
02:21:41,400 --> 02:21:42,700
Okay, sir.

1891
02:21:44,400 --> 02:21:47,030
Sir, if you don't go
and address the media,

1892
02:21:47,070 --> 02:21:48,650
it will be proven
you're the murderer.

1893
02:21:48,700 --> 02:21:49,900
Hey!

1894
02:21:50,030 --> 02:21:53,110
Sir, you're innocent, why
should you get scared!

1895
02:21:53,150 --> 02:21:55,320
Hey! This case won't be
accepted by the court.

1896
02:21:55,360 --> 02:21:58,740
Sir, our conscience is clear,
why should we be scared?

1897
02:21:58,780 --> 02:22:00,320
Lets just meet them.

1898
02:22:02,450 --> 02:22:04,030
Sir, not just that,

1899
02:22:04,110 --> 02:22:05,700
this is free publicity for you.

1900
02:22:16,110 --> 02:22:18,530
All of you just wait there.
Just Wait there.

1901
02:22:18,650 --> 02:22:21,070
I have no answers
for any questions.

1902
02:22:21,110 --> 02:22:24,200
All of you know that
this is a stupid case.

1903
02:22:24,240 --> 02:22:26,740
Firstly this case will
not be registered in court.

1904
02:22:26,780 --> 02:22:29,280
If it gets registered, then
you come and question me.

1905
02:22:29,280 --> 02:22:30,740
I will answer.

1906
02:22:30,780 --> 02:22:34,030
Please don't blow this
out of proportion anymore.

1907
02:22:34,050 --> 02:22:36,700
"As the news pours in,
that the reason for,"

1908
02:22:36,750 --> 02:22:39,290
"the demise of Ayya
Aadhimoolam's soul is,"

1909
02:22:39,330 --> 02:22:40,830
"well known producer
and actor Dhanapal."

1910
02:22:40,870 --> 02:22:44,790
"It has caused a major
uproar amidst Ayya's fans."

1911
02:22:44,790 --> 02:22:46,660
"The court must accept this case."

1912
02:22:46,700 --> 02:22:47,830
"All these days we
were believing this."

1913
02:22:47,830 --> 02:22:49,290
"What's the answer
to our belief?"

1914
02:22:49,330 --> 02:22:50,830
"It is alright if the court
doesn't accept this case,"

1915
02:22:50,830 --> 02:22:52,200
"we will deal with it,
in our own way!"

1916
02:22:52,250 --> 02:22:54,450
"The court has to punish the man
responsible for Ayya's death."

1917
02:22:54,500 --> 02:22:55,450
"If it doesn't punish,
we will punish him."

1918
02:22:55,500 --> 02:22:56,620
"There will be major riots..."

1919
02:22:56,660 --> 02:22:57,870
"If the court doesn't
hear this case."

1920
02:22:57,910 --> 02:22:58,750
"It will become a huge issue."

1921
02:22:58,750 --> 02:23:00,200
"What do they think..."

1922
02:23:00,250 --> 02:23:01,660
"That man has to own up..."

1923
02:23:01,700 --> 02:23:04,870
"If he doesn't, we will break into
his house and beat him up."

1924
02:23:04,910 --> 02:23:06,580
What is happening in this city?

1925
02:23:06,620 --> 02:23:07,540
"What nonsense is this?"

1926
02:23:07,580 --> 02:23:10,540
"He has done the damage
and is happily sitting..."

1927
02:23:10,580 --> 02:23:11,660
"Watching that we should
keep quiet is it!"

1928
02:23:11,700 --> 02:23:12,290
Hello!

1929
02:23:12,330 --> 02:23:12,870
What is it?

1930
02:23:12,870 --> 02:23:15,000
There is a lot of crowd
at the door step.

1931
02:23:15,040 --> 02:23:17,500
Come down soon.
Even the police have come.

1932
02:23:18,290 --> 02:23:19,370
"Understand one thing..."

1933
02:23:19,410 --> 02:23:20,950
"We won't leave this..."

1934
02:23:21,040 --> 02:23:21,700
"We need a solution..."

1935
02:23:37,250 --> 02:23:40,620
Come out Dhanapal.

1936
02:24:30,540 --> 02:24:32,870
Sir, the problem is
becoming bigger...

1937
02:24:32,910 --> 02:24:35,290
In this situation,
you can't go out anywhere.

1938
02:24:35,330 --> 02:24:37,290
It's not safe for you anymore.

1939
02:24:38,830 --> 02:24:41,120
They are all boiling with rage.

1940
02:24:41,160 --> 02:24:43,200
They will damage your property.

1941
02:24:43,290 --> 02:24:45,410
This will keep getting
worse, day by day.

1942
02:24:45,450 --> 02:24:47,660
The media is fully supporting them.

1943
02:24:47,700 --> 02:24:53,120
They will make use of this situation,
and the media will keep blowing it up.

1944
02:24:56,540 --> 02:24:59,410
Lets deal with this case differently.

1945
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:01,330
Lets go to court,

1946
02:25:01,370 --> 02:25:03,080
and file a defamation suit.

1947
02:25:03,120 --> 02:25:06,450
Lets plead for your safety,
and ask for police protection.

1948
02:25:06,500 --> 02:25:08,290
If this case gets heard in court,

1949
02:25:08,410 --> 02:25:11,580
definitely the judgment,
will be in favour of us.

1950
02:25:12,120 --> 02:25:13,620
Okay.

1951
02:25:18,580 --> 02:25:19,450
Sir,

1952
02:25:19,500 --> 02:25:22,830
Dhanapal has said Ayya's
fans are threatening him,

1953
02:25:22,870 --> 02:25:25,160
and has asked for police protection.

1954
02:25:25,200 --> 02:25:28,580
Not just that, he has accused us
of spreading false news about him,

1955
02:25:28,620 --> 02:25:32,500
and so he has filed a defamation
suit in court against us.

1956
02:25:33,040 --> 02:25:38,040
For the first time in history,
The court will be hearing a case for a soul.

1957
02:25:38,080 --> 02:25:41,790
The trial will be heard in a while...

1958
02:25:53,410 --> 02:25:55,290
I told you all that day itself...

1959
02:25:55,330 --> 02:25:57,330
All of you already
know the answer.

1960
02:25:57,370 --> 02:25:59,160
How can I kill a dead person?

1961
02:25:59,160 --> 02:26:01,580
They are cheating people,
with this soul nonsense!

1962
02:26:01,620 --> 02:26:03,330
There used to be
so many actors then...

1963
02:26:03,370 --> 02:26:05,290
There used to be
so many artistes then...

1964
02:26:05,330 --> 02:26:07,040
Aren't they true artistes?

1965
02:26:07,080 --> 02:26:08,700
Where have all
those souls gone?

1966
02:26:08,700 --> 02:26:11,250
That's okay sir. Apparently you narrated
one story, in the beginning,

1967
02:26:11,290 --> 02:26:13,290
and later on filmed something
different, and wrong, is it ?

1968
02:26:13,290 --> 02:26:16,790
Look here, my family is a
very respected family.

1969
02:26:16,830 --> 02:26:20,290
From my father's time, we are
producing films for the past fifty years.

1970
02:26:20,330 --> 02:26:21,580
"The family lamp,"

1971
02:26:21,620 --> 02:26:22,950
"Promise on the holy thread,"

1972
02:26:23,000 --> 02:26:27,250
"Our Sister", we have made many such good
films and have won awards as well!!!

1973
02:26:27,290 --> 02:26:29,450
You shouldn't be
talking badly about us!!!

1974
02:26:29,500 --> 02:26:31,250
Sir... sir... don't get angry.

1975
02:26:31,290 --> 02:26:33,540
I am not getting angry.
I am just clarifying.

1976
02:26:33,750 --> 02:26:36,750
Anyway, in sometime,
the truth will be out.

1977
02:26:36,870 --> 02:26:38,830
Let me go
inside and talk.

1978
02:26:39,540 --> 02:26:41,160
Just one more thing,

1979
02:26:41,410 --> 02:26:43,750
if there is any danger to my life,

1980
02:26:43,790 --> 02:26:47,870
the late Aadhimoolam and
his family are responsible.

1981
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:50,750
This miserable condition
I am going through,

1982
02:26:50,790 --> 02:26:53,160
no one should ever
have to go through.

1983
02:26:53,200 --> 02:26:55,080
Make way... make way...

1984
02:26:56,750 --> 02:26:59,200
Okay sir. Lets see.

1985
02:27:02,370 --> 02:27:04,040
Sit down.

1986
02:27:24,790 --> 02:27:28,250
That guy... who is that guy
wearing glasses?

1987
02:27:28,830 --> 02:27:32,500
Sir, he's the guy,
who filed the case against you.

1988
02:27:39,290 --> 02:27:41,290
I have seen him somewhere.

1989
02:27:41,330 --> 02:27:44,410
He's come to our office many times,
to narrate stories, sir.

1990
02:27:44,450 --> 02:27:48,200
You gave him lot of opinions
and sent him away.

1991
02:28:16,370 --> 02:28:18,200
Is the witness ready?

1992
02:28:18,410 --> 02:28:19,540
Dhanapal.

1993
02:29:46,660 --> 02:29:49,450
Sir, everyone's trying to kill me.

1994
02:29:51,450 --> 02:29:54,790
All the people of Tamil Nadu
are supporting them.

1995
02:29:54,830 --> 02:29:57,450
This is similar to the story, of how
Lord Ganesha, drank the milk.

1996
02:29:57,500 --> 02:29:59,410
No one will believe me now, sir.

1997
02:29:59,450 --> 02:30:01,540
My time is not good now, sir.

1998
02:30:01,580 --> 02:30:03,330
My stars are in
bad alignment now.

1999
02:30:03,370 --> 02:30:05,000
I should have never
made this film now.

2000
02:30:05,040 --> 02:30:07,540
In spite of that I made it,
so I deserve this.

2001
02:30:07,580 --> 02:30:10,200
There never used to be
anyone around my house.

2002
02:30:10,250 --> 02:30:11,950
It's a very private space.

2003
02:30:11,950 --> 02:30:15,660
But now, there are always groups
standing there, shouting slogans.

2004
02:30:15,700 --> 02:30:17,750
It's really frightening to come out.

2005
02:30:17,750 --> 02:30:19,250
There are women at home.

2006
02:30:19,290 --> 02:30:21,790
In a situation like this,
what can we do sir?

2007
02:30:21,910 --> 02:30:23,910
No one is trying to kill him.

2008
02:30:23,950 --> 02:30:26,080
A dead person's soul,
which was alive,

2009
02:30:26,120 --> 02:30:26,870
is no more now.

2010
02:30:26,870 --> 02:30:28,410
He is the reason for that.

2011
02:30:28,450 --> 02:30:30,330
That's why people are
showing their anger on him.

2012
02:30:30,410 --> 02:30:32,750
For the past three
years they have loved,

2013
02:30:32,790 --> 02:30:34,500
and been amazed by
a person's performance.

2014
02:30:34,540 --> 02:30:35,700
After the shoot
of this man's film...

2015
02:30:35,750 --> 02:30:37,580
That was the 22nd of October,

2016
02:30:37,580 --> 02:30:40,450
has not been seen anywhere.
And he is the main reason for it.

2017
02:30:40,500 --> 02:30:43,330
Sir, firstly, he passed away long ago.

2018
02:30:43,410 --> 02:30:45,330
It's four years since
he passed away.

2019
02:30:45,370 --> 02:30:47,000
Sir, after someone's death,

2020
02:30:47,040 --> 02:30:48,750
to say the soul is acting,
is all rubbish...

2021
02:30:48,790 --> 02:30:49,410
Hey...

2022
02:30:57,950 --> 02:31:00,160
Please don't use unnecessary words.

2023
02:31:00,200 --> 02:31:01,620
Please forgive me, sir.

2024
02:31:01,660 --> 02:31:03,160
Let him be a great man sir.

2025
02:31:03,200 --> 02:31:05,290
I've heard about him
from my father's times,

2026
02:31:05,330 --> 02:31:07,290
I've not seen any
of his plays, sir.

2027
02:31:07,330 --> 02:31:10,200
Saying that a dead man
is acting in all the films,

2028
02:31:10,250 --> 02:31:13,370
leave alone yourself,
no one will believe it.

2029
02:31:13,450 --> 02:31:14,790
There is no proof for it.

2030
02:31:16,790 --> 02:31:19,540
By claiming there is a soul,
this group has earned a lot.

2031
02:31:19,660 --> 02:31:22,620
Someone should have filed
a case on them long back.

2032
02:31:22,660 --> 02:31:24,410
After a point,
how long can they,

2033
02:31:24,450 --> 02:31:26,290
keep saying this,
and continue living?

2034
02:31:26,330 --> 02:31:27,410
This fraudulent gang,

2035
02:31:27,450 --> 02:31:29,790
now wants to just
swindle my money.

2036
02:31:29,830 --> 02:31:32,160
Just you wait and see,
after all this,

2037
02:31:32,200 --> 02:31:35,250
again one day, they will
say Ayya has come back.

2038
02:31:35,290 --> 02:31:36,870
Where was he sir?

2039
02:31:37,080 --> 02:31:39,290
When did he act sir?

2040
02:31:39,330 --> 02:31:41,040
Now, where has he gone sir?

2041
02:31:42,080 --> 02:31:42,830
Sir?

2042
02:31:42,910 --> 02:31:45,500
Don't you know,
they are lying?

2043
02:31:45,620 --> 02:31:46,540
So,

2044
02:31:46,540 --> 02:31:47,580
he did not act
in your film?

2045
02:31:47,580 --> 02:31:48,790
He did not act.

2046
02:31:48,830 --> 02:31:49,910
In my film,
only I acted.

2047
02:31:49,950 --> 02:31:52,250
Then, what about the
payment you gave him?

2048
02:31:52,290 --> 02:31:53,080
Huh?

2049
02:31:53,120 --> 02:31:53,700
Ask them?

2050
02:31:53,830 --> 02:31:56,540
If there are any
cheque transactions?

2051
02:31:56,580 --> 02:31:58,000
So the entire payment
was in cash, is it?

2052
02:31:58,000 --> 02:31:59,750
I've not given them any money.

2053
02:31:59,790 --> 02:32:02,330
If I have given, ask them
to show the proof.

2054
02:32:03,370 --> 02:32:05,290
They have definitely given money.

2055
02:32:05,370 --> 02:32:08,330
They have destroyed all the
vouchers signed by them.

2056
02:32:11,410 --> 02:32:15,290
Then why have you advertised,
that Ayya is acting in your film?

2057
02:32:15,330 --> 02:32:16,830
What is this?

2058
02:32:20,450 --> 02:32:22,000
Give that here...

2059
02:32:29,370 --> 02:32:31,580
Sir, you itself take a look at it.

2060
02:32:43,160 --> 02:32:45,330
Just look at the
4 or 5 five posters,

2061
02:32:45,370 --> 02:32:47,500
everything states that,
Ayya is acting!

2062
02:32:48,330 --> 02:32:50,660
They sometimes announce,
it's a true story,

2063
02:32:50,660 --> 02:32:52,830
but are all those true stories?

2064
02:32:53,500 --> 02:32:54,790
It's just a trend...

2065
02:32:54,830 --> 02:32:58,250
Likewise, stating that
Ayya's acting is a trend.

2066
02:32:58,290 --> 02:32:59,910
That's why we put it.

2067
02:33:01,870 --> 02:33:03,620
Not just me sir,

2068
02:33:03,750 --> 02:33:06,330
because people like it,
everyone was putting it.

2069
02:33:06,410 --> 02:33:08,950
Who has got the copyrights
for this, sir?

2070
02:33:09,040 --> 02:33:10,870
Who has got the patent, sir?

2071
02:33:10,950 --> 02:33:12,790
I don't know about the others.

2072
02:33:12,830 --> 02:33:15,040
But, I haven't given them any money.

2073
02:33:16,290 --> 02:33:18,500
So, Ayya's soul hasn't
acted in your film?

2074
02:33:18,540 --> 02:33:20,950
I don't believe that
a soul can act.

2075
02:33:21,000 --> 02:33:24,200
But, they are saying that Ayya
acted through you, in your film!

2076
02:33:24,200 --> 02:33:25,540
Definitely not!

2077
02:33:25,620 --> 02:33:28,160
There is no soul... no ghost...
nothing inside me!

2078
02:33:29,950 --> 02:33:32,370
Firstly, nothing can possess me.

2079
02:33:32,450 --> 02:33:33,580
Because,

2080
02:33:33,830 --> 02:33:37,700
I am wearing the holy thread,
from my family temple.

2081
02:33:45,580 --> 02:33:49,700
In this pen drive, there is a scene
from the film, which he has acted.

2082
02:33:49,750 --> 02:33:51,080
You take a look at that.

2083
02:33:51,080 --> 02:33:53,040
If he performs that scene now,

2084
02:33:53,080 --> 02:33:54,540
Ayya did not act in his film,

2085
02:33:54,540 --> 02:33:55,790
it is him only who acted.

2086
02:33:55,790 --> 02:33:57,410
Sir... sir... you don't look at that.

2087
02:33:57,410 --> 02:33:58,700
Tell them to give it to me.

2088
02:33:58,750 --> 02:34:00,290
In the return statement,

2089
02:34:00,330 --> 02:34:02,750
they have not mentioned
this as an exhibit.

2090
02:34:02,790 --> 02:34:04,370
They cannot mark this today.

2091
02:34:04,410 --> 02:34:05,910
The shooting of my
film is not yet over.

2092
02:34:05,950 --> 02:34:07,580
Only half the film is over.

2093
02:34:07,580 --> 02:34:09,660
How is my film's
footage available here?

2094
02:34:09,700 --> 02:34:10,700
They have stolen it.

2095
02:34:10,700 --> 02:34:12,370
I wonder, what more atrocities
are going to happen?

2096
02:34:12,410 --> 02:34:13,750
I am going to file
a case right now.

2097
02:34:13,750 --> 02:34:15,870
These people have stolen my film.

2098
02:34:16,790 --> 02:34:18,000
What is this?

2099
02:34:18,040 --> 02:34:20,370
How is the footage of
his unreleased film,

2100
02:34:20,410 --> 02:34:21,370
in your hands?

2101
02:34:21,410 --> 02:34:23,450
Okay, but why presenting it now?

2102
02:34:23,500 --> 02:34:25,330
Let him file a case on us.

2103
02:34:25,370 --> 02:34:26,910
Our intention is
just one thing,

2104
02:34:26,950 --> 02:34:28,410
you, please give permission.

2105
02:34:28,450 --> 02:34:30,370
Yes, that footage has
come from his film unit.

2106
02:34:30,410 --> 02:34:32,540
We agree that it has
come to us illegally.

2107
02:34:32,580 --> 02:34:34,540
We are ready to
face the consequences.

2108
02:34:34,580 --> 02:34:36,330
We did that knowingly!

2109
02:34:36,370 --> 02:34:38,250
All we want to know,
is just one thing.

2110
02:34:38,370 --> 02:34:40,950
He advertised saying, that
Ayya is acting through him.

2111
02:34:41,000 --> 02:34:42,580
Now he's claiming
he himself acted.

2112
02:34:42,620 --> 02:34:44,330
Just take a look at the
scene he has acted.

2113
02:34:44,370 --> 02:34:46,660
Let him perform
the same scene here.

2114
02:34:46,700 --> 02:34:47,910
If he does perform it,

2115
02:34:47,910 --> 02:34:49,870
it will be proved that
Ayya's soul did not act.

2116
02:34:49,910 --> 02:34:51,160
And that he himself acted.

2117
02:34:51,200 --> 02:34:53,620
Then we will accept
both the defamation suit,

2118
02:34:53,660 --> 02:34:56,120
and the case for illegally
procuring the footage.

2119
02:34:56,120 --> 02:34:59,370
Then like he said, Ayya's
soul was never there.

2120
02:34:59,410 --> 02:35:00,950
People have been fooled,

2121
02:35:00,950 --> 02:35:03,370
and they have been frauds,
will be proved.

2122
02:35:06,080 --> 02:35:08,450
Hey! I am saying, stealing
the footage itself is wrong!

2123
02:35:08,500 --> 02:35:09,370
Give me that pen drive!

2124
02:35:09,370 --> 02:35:10,700
Why you screaming?

2125
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:14,250
This is the court,
and I am present.

2126
02:35:14,290 --> 02:35:15,410
The pendrive will reach you.

2127
02:35:15,410 --> 02:35:17,250
It will not go out anywhere.

2128
02:35:17,290 --> 02:35:19,750
You're worried that the footage
is out, before the release.

2129
02:35:19,790 --> 02:35:22,660
The appropriate course of action,
will be taken.

2130
02:35:25,750 --> 02:35:30,540
They are advertising, that Ayya's
soul is acting through others.

2131
02:35:30,580 --> 02:35:32,660
People are also coming
and watching.

2132
02:35:32,700 --> 02:35:35,790
Ayya has not acted that's a lie,
is what you're saying.

2133
02:35:35,830 --> 02:35:37,040
If that's proved,

2134
02:35:37,080 --> 02:35:38,410
The case is closed.

2135
02:35:41,000 --> 02:35:42,790
If you just act that scene out,

2136
02:35:42,830 --> 02:35:44,910
everything will be answered.

2137
02:35:49,620 --> 02:35:52,290
Just fit the pendrive
on to my lap top,

2138
02:35:52,330 --> 02:35:53,790
and give it to me.

2139
02:36:00,580 --> 02:36:02,370
Sir, what is this?

2140
02:36:02,410 --> 02:36:04,290
They have stolen my film.

2141
02:36:04,330 --> 02:36:06,200
I am telling you,

2142
02:36:06,250 --> 02:36:07,910
action will be taken for that.

2143
02:36:14,540 --> 02:36:18,370
Sir, you're The Honourable one.

2144
02:36:18,410 --> 02:36:19,370
You're a Judge!

2145
02:36:20,870 --> 02:36:23,330
You're the God
who delivers justice!

2146
02:36:23,410 --> 02:36:24,700
You're like God!

2147
02:36:24,750 --> 02:36:27,040
How can you give
such a judgement?

2148
02:36:27,950 --> 02:36:30,950
I have not yet
announced the judgement.

2149
02:36:31,580 --> 02:36:33,200
If you have only acted,

2150
02:36:33,250 --> 02:36:35,450
what is your problem
to act it out now?

2151
02:37:07,000 --> 02:37:08,160
Ramya!

2152
02:37:14,660 --> 02:37:15,950
Ramya!

2153
02:40:23,040 --> 02:40:25,250
You also take a
look at this scene.

2154
02:40:25,290 --> 02:40:26,290
Take your time.

2155
02:40:42,910 --> 02:40:46,000
"They have requested Dhanapal,
to enact a scene which,"

2156
02:40:46,040 --> 02:40:47,330
"he has already done before."

2157
02:40:47,370 --> 02:40:49,450
"Dhanapal, is going to
act in a while."

2158
02:40:49,500 --> 02:40:51,540
"If Dhanapal performs
just like before,"

2159
02:40:51,580 --> 02:40:53,790
"there is no such
thing as Ayya's soul."

2160
02:40:53,830 --> 02:40:56,120
"It will be proved that it
was Dhanapal who acted."

2161
02:40:56,120 --> 02:40:59,040
"Other actors also
acted by themselves."

2162
02:40:59,040 --> 02:41:02,160
"All this while, it is us the people,
who have been cheated."

2163
02:41:02,160 --> 02:41:03,790
"If Dhanapal is not able to act."

2164
02:41:03,830 --> 02:41:06,000
"Then the fact, that Ayya's
soul acted, will be proved."

2165
02:41:06,040 --> 02:41:09,450
"If that's the case, why is
Ayya's soul not coming now?"

2166
02:41:09,500 --> 02:41:12,120
"Who and what are the
reasons for the demise?"

2167
02:41:12,120 --> 02:41:14,870
"All these questions, shall be
answered. In a short while."

2168
02:41:31,040 --> 02:41:34,080
Sir, for fifty years,
from your dad's period,

2169
02:41:34,120 --> 02:41:35,660
you have been in films.

2170
02:41:35,700 --> 02:41:38,330
Luckily you weren't
given any other scene.

2171
02:41:38,370 --> 02:41:39,790
They have made it easy for us,

2172
02:41:39,830 --> 02:41:42,750
by giving us a scene
with no dialogues.

2173
02:41:44,080 --> 02:41:47,700
This is a cake walk,
just go nail it sir.

2174
02:41:48,080 --> 02:41:50,200
Sir, you used to keep saying,

2175
02:41:50,250 --> 02:41:52,120
that in school,
you acted in a play,

2176
02:41:52,160 --> 02:41:54,080
as the King Veerapandiya
Kattabomman,

2177
02:41:54,120 --> 02:41:55,040
and the whole
school was shocked.

2178
02:41:55,080 --> 02:41:57,290
Sir, you have performed like
the great actor Sivaji Ganesan,

2179
02:41:57,330 --> 02:41:59,450
won't you be able
to act like Ayya!

2180
02:41:59,500 --> 02:42:01,290
You are going to act.

2181
02:42:01,330 --> 02:42:03,000
And the whole world
is going to be shocked!

2182
02:42:03,040 --> 02:42:05,700
We are going to
win this case, sir.

2183
02:42:05,750 --> 02:42:07,450
We are winning, sir!

2184
02:42:09,450 --> 02:42:11,540
Hey! give me water.

2185
02:42:36,330 --> 02:42:37,750
Call Dhanapal.

2186
02:42:50,040 --> 02:42:51,080
Are you ready?

2187
02:42:51,790 --> 02:42:55,200
Honorable Judge, is this fair?

2188
02:42:55,290 --> 02:42:56,870
Do you think this is right?

2189
02:42:56,910 --> 02:42:59,830
Has this kind of injustice,
happened anywhere?

2190
02:42:59,870 --> 02:43:01,330
They are saying
I killed a dead man.

2191
02:43:01,330 --> 02:43:03,790
Screening my unreleased
film, to me itself,

2192
02:43:03,830 --> 02:43:05,870
and asking me to enact it!

2193
02:43:05,910 --> 02:43:06,750
What is this, sir?

2194
02:43:08,410 --> 02:43:10,870
Why are you repeating
the same old thing?

2195
02:43:10,910 --> 02:43:13,870
This court exists for you to
prove your side of the truth.

2196
02:43:13,910 --> 02:43:16,370
We have given you a
chance to prove.

2197
02:43:16,410 --> 02:43:17,540
Prove it.

2198
02:43:22,540 --> 02:43:24,290
Now are you going to act,

2199
02:43:24,330 --> 02:43:26,200
or are you going to disobey
the court's order?

2200
02:43:26,250 --> 02:43:29,910
If you disobey the court's order,
the case can turn against you.

2201
02:43:29,950 --> 02:43:31,080
Don't need to do
the entire thing.

2202
02:43:31,120 --> 02:43:33,500
What you have performed
in the last portion of that scene,

2203
02:43:33,500 --> 02:43:35,580
just do that alone.

2204
02:44:10,040 --> 02:44:11,620
Act!!!

2205
02:44:40,250 --> 02:44:41,910
It's getting late.

2206
02:44:42,540 --> 02:44:44,950
We have given you enough time.

2207
02:44:45,040 --> 02:44:47,000
Don't waste the court's time.

2208
02:44:51,540 --> 02:44:53,830
Why sir, you messing it up?

2209
02:45:19,830 --> 02:45:21,410
I will beat you rascal!!!

2210
02:45:21,450 --> 02:45:24,160
You are screening my film
and asking me itself to act.

2211
02:45:25,040 --> 02:45:28,000
I will start contempt of court
proceedings against you.

2212
02:45:28,040 --> 02:45:29,370
Behave yourself in court.

2213
02:45:30,000 --> 02:45:32,950
Have you not told your client,
how to behave in court?

2214
02:45:38,790 --> 02:45:41,040
You have just
ten seconds now.

2215
02:45:43,330 --> 02:45:44,950
Why sir?

2216
02:45:45,080 --> 02:45:47,700
Hey! I will see to that you
don't exist in cinema!!!

2217
02:45:47,750 --> 02:45:50,540
Just see what I
do to all of you!!!

2218
02:45:52,250 --> 02:45:53,660
I won't act!

2219
02:45:53,700 --> 02:45:55,950
Even if I die,
I won't act!

2220
02:45:56,000 --> 02:45:57,950
Even if my life is over
I won't act!

2221
02:45:57,950 --> 02:46:00,250
You can do what you want.

2222
02:46:00,370 --> 02:46:02,410
He has accused
me for killing...

2223
02:46:02,410 --> 02:46:04,830
You can even give me
a death sentence.

2224
02:46:04,910 --> 02:46:06,580
But I will never act!!!

2225
02:46:08,410 --> 02:46:10,040
Are you playing the fool!!!

2226
02:46:10,080 --> 02:46:11,040
You want me to act is it...

2227
02:46:11,080 --> 02:46:12,500
Why should I act?

2228
02:46:14,540 --> 02:46:16,000
Your time is over.

2229
02:46:16,870 --> 02:46:18,370
I will go to the supreme court.

2230
02:46:24,500 --> 02:46:27,830
As Dhanapal wasn't able
to prove his innocence,

2231
02:46:28,120 --> 02:46:31,000
the defamation suit he has filed,

2232
02:46:31,040 --> 02:46:34,700
against Parasuraman and Ayya
Aadhimoolam's family,

2233
02:46:34,750 --> 02:46:37,160
has been dismissed.

2234
02:46:39,040 --> 02:46:41,200
Moreover, no one should spread,

2235
02:46:41,290 --> 02:46:45,200
such baseless, and
meaningless rumours.

2236
02:46:45,620 --> 02:46:47,660
No media should carry any news,

2237
02:46:47,700 --> 02:46:50,160
associating Dhanapal's
name with this.

2238
02:46:50,200 --> 02:46:51,790
It's a court order.

2239
02:46:52,200 --> 02:46:55,500
Moreover, while the
court was on trial,

2240
02:46:55,620 --> 02:46:57,620
Dhanapal disrespected the court.

2241
02:46:57,700 --> 02:46:59,830
Therefore I order the
Police Department,

2242
02:46:59,870 --> 02:47:02,080
to take necessary action.

2243
02:47:15,870 --> 02:47:20,200
I think, no court would have
come across such a case.

2244
02:47:20,660 --> 02:47:23,620
Whether a soul exists or doesn't,

2245
02:47:23,700 --> 02:47:26,080
cannot be proved in any court.

2246
02:47:26,160 --> 02:47:28,120
This is similar to the belief in God.

2247
02:47:28,410 --> 02:47:29,370
But,

2248
02:47:29,540 --> 02:47:33,000
someone who knows how to act well,
is unable to act today!

2249
02:47:33,080 --> 02:47:35,250
There is no answer for this as well.

2250
02:47:35,250 --> 02:47:38,580
We can never approach
everything logically.

2251
02:47:38,580 --> 02:47:42,290
Especially, art is beyond logic.

2252
02:47:42,410 --> 02:47:45,120
Even before civilization came into being,

2253
02:47:45,160 --> 02:47:46,790
there was art in humans.

2254
02:47:46,830 --> 02:47:49,540
Art is one amongst
the basic things,

2255
02:47:49,580 --> 02:47:51,620
that can't be
separated from us.

2256
02:47:51,660 --> 02:47:55,290
Maybe because some
miracles exist with us,

2257
02:47:55,330 --> 02:47:58,000
we don't realize the value of them.

2258
02:47:59,160 --> 02:48:02,250
I don't know whether
such miracles happen.

2259
02:48:02,290 --> 02:48:03,540
And if such miracles happen,

2260
02:48:03,580 --> 02:48:06,290
I don't know whether we
will allow it to sustain.

2261
02:48:06,330 --> 02:48:10,290
To Ayya's fans, I just have
one thing to say.

2262
02:48:10,870 --> 02:48:14,950
Lets not have all these,
confusions and problems.

2263
02:48:15,620 --> 02:48:18,620
There is no end for
artistes and art.

2264
02:48:18,660 --> 02:48:21,750
As long as this universe
exists, it will exist!

2265
02:49:17,910 --> 02:49:26,500
Ayya. Aadhimoolam
Born : 01. 05. 1939
Died : 22. 10. 2017

2266
02:49:28,410 --> 02:49:32,660
"Government Higher Secondary School.
Kaduvanur."

2267
02:52:03,580 --> 02:52:09,000
" Art never ends with death... "
