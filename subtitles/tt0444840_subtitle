1
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:17,342
Wonder how many people reside
in the whole world!

2
00:01:18,311 --> 00:01:22,441
Different colours... different
castes... different types...

3
00:01:23,316 --> 00:01:26,808
Whereverthere are people
there is one more thing...

4
00:01:27,187 --> 00:01:33,023
No! No! I am not talking about crowds!
I am talking about relationships.

5
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:38,297
Mother-Father! Brother-Sister!
Husband-Wife!

6
00:01:38,865 --> 00:01:42,699
Or such relationships
which have no name.

7
00:01:43,736 --> 00:01:45,897
Then how are these
relationships made?

8
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,001
What connects people
in this world?

9
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:53,907
What is it that bonds
us to each other?

10
00:01:54,881 --> 00:02:02,652
Sentiment! Yes it is sentiment
that keeps us linked to each other.

11
00:02:03,556 --> 00:02:08,391
Till this emotion is alive,
our relationship is alive.

12
00:02:09,262 --> 00:02:10,991
Our love is alive.

13
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:19,003
No one can teach you this
emotion. Except for life.

14
00:02:45,064 --> 00:02:47,362
Hi, Rasik sir! Catch!

15
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:49,834
Don't throw it like that.
It is a very sensitive device.

16
00:02:50,036 --> 00:02:51,162
Sorry! Sorry!

17
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:52,235
How is the car?

18
00:02:52,438 --> 00:02:54,599
Excellent! I really
enjoyed the ride, sir.

19
00:02:57,277 --> 00:02:59,837
Sign please, sir.
- Hi! - Hi!

20
00:03:02,615 --> 00:03:05,209
Where should
I sign, on your face?

21
00:03:05,618 --> 00:03:06,846
Sorry, sir. Sign here.

22
00:03:07,053 --> 00:03:07,815
Then you should tell that.

23
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:08,851
Sorry, sir.

24
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:13,216
Now go! There is no need to
come to work from tomorrow.

25
00:03:13,426 --> 00:03:14,154
Thank you, sir.

26
00:03:14,961 --> 00:03:16,952
Good morning, Aditya.
- Good morning.

27
00:03:17,297 --> 00:03:19,959
Surprising! She said
good morning to you.

28
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:22,234
Why don't they say that to me?

29
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:25,767
Why do these super fast
girls or super fast cars...

30
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:28,099
...come to top gear on seeing you?

31
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:29,866
Why it doesn't happen with me?

32
00:03:30,076 --> 00:03:31,338
Don't you know?

33
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:34,308
Whether a girl or a car, we must pamper them.
We must keep them with a lot of love.

34
00:03:34,514 --> 00:03:36,277
Both need a lot of
care and attention.

35
00:03:36,482 --> 00:03:37,107
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

36
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:39,683
This is general knowledge, sir.
Even a fool knows that.

37
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:41,217
You know what? - What. - What?

38
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:42,615
I have good news foryou.
- Tell me! Tell me!

39
00:03:42,822 --> 00:03:43,288
Follow me!

40
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:45,616
Tell me! Please tell me!

41
00:03:45,825 --> 00:03:50,194
Aditya! Our company is going to
launch a new car into the market.

42
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:54,162
Do you know we will be doing
its marketing in entire India?

43
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:55,391
Oh, no! I am finished.

44
00:03:55,602 --> 00:03:59,868
No, you are not.
You are going to be my head.

45
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:01,069
I am ruined.

46
00:04:01,274 --> 00:04:04,209
What ruined?
You are promoted.

47
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,674
Your salary is going
to be increased.

48
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:07,538
Oh, no!

49
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:11,205
What is this?
You are going to Canada.

50
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:16,184
Boss! My engagement party is today.
See this engagement ring.

51
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:18,653
Yes, I know.
I am also coming to it.

52
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:20,519
But it is at six o'clock.

53
00:04:22,328 --> 00:04:23,693
What is the time now?

54
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:26,624
Six o'clock...
Now the time is five past six.

55
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:29,668
Don't know what
Sonia will do to me now.

56
00:04:35,141 --> 00:04:36,608
Wow! Sonia looks gorgeous!

57
00:04:36,809 --> 00:04:39,175
She looks very stylish today.
- She rocks.

58
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:42,177
Whose sister is she after all?
You know, she is a fashion designer.

59
00:04:42,382 --> 00:04:44,145
You know, she understands fashion.

60
00:04:44,717 --> 00:04:48,483
Hi, Tanya! - Hi Sonia!
What does fashion mean to you?

61
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:54,150
Fashion is what
I wear and others wear.

62
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:56,223
They are just clothes. - I see.

63
00:04:56,429 --> 00:04:59,125
My daughter Sonia is
going to Paris next week.

64
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:02,062
For a fashion show.
She is a star you know.

65
00:05:02,268 --> 00:05:06,398
Don't say that. My would-be
daughter-in-law is not a star...

66
00:05:07,206 --> 00:05:08,867
...but a rock star. Rock star!

67
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:10,633
What's up with the
latest dress code?

68
00:05:10,843 --> 00:05:13,175
Red is the color of fashion
forthe ladies, you know!

69
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:14,437
And what about black?

70
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:15,636
They are all...

71
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:18,547
Amrut! - Yes?

72
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:23,279
I hope you told Adi that
today is his engagement. - Yes.

73
00:05:26,926 --> 00:05:29,895
'Your heartbeats... '
- Hey, what are you doing?

74
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:31,556
Why are you removing your clothes?

75
00:05:31,764 --> 00:05:32,958
If you want to pee,
I'll stop the car.

76
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,191
You keep driving.
I don't want to pee.

77
00:05:35,401 --> 00:05:37,392
I am just changing clothes.
Drive on fast.

78
00:05:37,603 --> 00:05:41,266
You didn't invite Aditya.
It would have been better to invite him.

79
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:42,566
Who Aditya?

80
00:05:42,775 --> 00:05:46,871
I think your son. Today is his
engagement with my daughter.

81
00:05:47,313 --> 00:05:49,975
Where is your prince? Call him.

82
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:52,151
Yes, please call him.

83
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:55,321
I too have elsewhere to go. - Yes.

84
00:05:55,788 --> 00:05:57,255
What are you doing?

85
00:05:57,457 --> 00:05:58,651
Let me drive the car. Oh!

86
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:00,849
I am... I am sorry.

87
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:05,554
You will kill me.
He is a goner!

88
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:08,266
I don't know why
Aditya is getting so late.

89
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:10,333
You know aunty,
had this been a love marriage...

90
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:11,764
...he would never be late.

91
00:06:11,971 --> 00:06:12,960
Shut up, rascal!

92
00:06:13,172 --> 00:06:16,107
Happy, listen to this.
- Tell me. - Are you enjoying?

93
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:20,439
Did you call Adi or not? - Call Adi?
- Please call. Please call quickly.

94
00:06:20,646 --> 00:06:22,170
I too have elsewhere to go.

95
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:27,843
Get out fast! Go! Go!

96
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:30,653
Boss! Boss! My shoe!

97
00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:32,347
Oh! Here comes my brother-in-law!

98
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:33,286
Hey Adi! What happened?
Only one shoe?

99
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:35,620
Nothing! The car took the shoe.
- The car took the shoe!

100
00:06:35,828 --> 00:06:38,797
Adi, where were you? Since when
we are waiting foryou. - Dad, the shoe...

101
00:06:38,998 --> 00:06:40,295
Adi, does anyone do such a thing
on such a day! - Mother...

102
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:44,061
Adi! Have some shame! - Granny, what are
you doing... I have applied gel on my hair.

103
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:46,704
Don't spoil his hair.
- Really? See this!

104
00:06:47,306 --> 00:06:47,772
Hey! Who is this?

105
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:48,440
I am not hitting him,
I am making him wear it.

106
00:06:48,641 --> 00:06:50,336
Dad! Dad, he is my boss.
- He is your boss? Sorry.

107
00:06:50,543 --> 00:06:53,876
Let me explain to you...
this world class grandson of yours...

108
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,411
...I am sending him to Canada.

109
00:06:55,615 --> 00:06:57,139
Canada? But why?

110
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:00,148
I will tell it... I'll tell them.
I got a promotion.

111
00:07:00,353 --> 00:07:01,217
Really!? - This is very good news.

112
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:04,982
You got a promotion and
you didn't even tell us.

113
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:06,158
I too learnt it Just now.

114
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:09,920
Wow! This is wonderful news. And that too
on engagement day. - Thank you. Thank you.

115
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:10,823
Great! I'm so happy.

116
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:13,794
How lucky is Sonia for Adi?
- Absolutely!

117
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,969
If you all are done then
please make me lucky too.

118
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:17,864
I have got to go.

119
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:19,469
To Canada?

120
00:07:19,672 --> 00:07:24,405
Hey Sonia, I must say your would-be
husband is very fashionable.

121
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:26,509
Shut up!

122
00:07:30,716 --> 00:07:32,115
I hope you got the ring.
- Yes, mom.

123
00:07:32,318 --> 00:07:34,912
Thank you. Thank you.
- What happened?

124
00:07:37,557 --> 00:07:39,923
Uncle, please move on.
We'll come later.

125
00:07:42,895 --> 00:07:44,226
Where's my ring? -Which ring?

126
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:45,089
The engagement ring!

127
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:47,198
What are you saying?
It must be here.

128
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,265
One minute... lift the coat.

129
00:07:51,704 --> 00:07:53,331
It must be in the front pocket.
The front pocket.

130

This is my engagement ring.
- Where is it? Lts not there in the left nor right.

He won't go below this!

"I know that you are a magician."

174
00:11:43,602 --> 00:11:48,301
"She is a magic wand
that flew off with my heart."

175
00:11:48,507 --> 00:11:49,667
"She is a rock star."

176
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,968
"She is indeed lovely."

177
00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:54,442
"Love for her oozes out."

178
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:58,344
"She is a rock star."

179
00:11:58,651 --> 00:12:02,951
"The one my eyes chose
that boy is a mesmerising one."

180
00:12:03,622 --> 00:12:07,956
"The one whom I heard,
he does not know me."

181
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:10,695
"The more I see,
the greater becomes my desire."

182
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:12,796
"He has taken over my life."

183
00:12:12,998 --> 00:12:14,090
"She is a rock star."

184
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,495
"She is indeed lovely."

185
00:12:16,702 --> 00:12:20,331
"Love for her oozes out."

186
00:12:20,539 --> 00:12:22,473
"She is a rock star."

187
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:27,669
"She is a magic wand
that flew off with my heart."

188
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:28,778
"She is a rock star."

189
00:12:28,981 --> 00:12:31,381
"She is indeed lovely."

190
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:34,849
"Love for her oozes out."

191
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:37,454
"She is a rock star."

192
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:54,998
You know, these traditions
are indeed fabulous.

193
00:12:55,207 --> 00:12:58,438
Two families come closer
in the name of uniting two people.

194
00:12:58,644 --> 00:13:00,271
They share little joys.

195
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:03,944
I just love it.
IJust love traditional marriage.

196
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:06,380
I don't think so.
I think it is a waste of time...

197
00:13:06,585 --> 00:13:07,643
...money and energy.

198
00:13:07,853 --> 00:13:09,081
It is we who are getting married.

199
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:12,018
Then why are we calling our friends
and relatives and feeding them?

200
00:13:12,391 --> 00:13:17,226
One must be practical in life.
I don't care for traditions.

201
00:13:17,429 --> 00:13:18,919
Everybody has his own opinion.

202
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:19,688
Yes.

203
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:23,531
Are you tired? - Not much.

204
00:13:25,704 --> 00:13:27,535
So... - So?

205
00:13:29,074 --> 00:13:30,769
Shall I leave? - Ok.

206
00:13:34,446 --> 00:13:36,004
Give me a kiss. - What!?

207
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:38,247
Give me a goodnight kiss.

208
00:13:39,084 --> 00:13:40,608
Is this some time for a kiss?

209
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,448
There isn't a time for a kiss.
One has to be in the mood for it.

210
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:46,716
You have to be romantic.
Give me a kiss.

211
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:48,459
Aditya, someone might see.

212
00:13:48,861 --> 00:13:54,231
Who is going to see us at 3.30 am?
And I've got the license too.

213
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,060
We Just got engaged...
you are my fiancée.

214
00:13:57,269 --> 00:13:58,759
Please give me a kiss.

215
00:13:59,805 --> 00:14:01,067
Just grow up!

216
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:03,400
Why... grown ups don't take kisses?

217
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:06,235
Tanya.

218
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:10,077
Sonia, why don't you give
Aditya what he asked?

219
00:14:10,282 --> 00:14:13,251
If you can't do it, I will do it.
Daddy too is ready in the room.

220
00:14:13,452 --> 00:14:14,919
And he said that mom is ready too.

221
00:14:15,287 --> 00:14:17,255
And for God's sake tell
him to take the hand...

222
00:14:17,456 --> 00:14:18,252
...off the speaker phone.

223
00:14:18,624 --> 00:14:20,251
It is 3.30 am in the morning.

224
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:22,586
Ridiculous that
you are fighting over a kiss.

225
00:14:22,828 --> 00:14:24,090
C'mon give him a kiss.

226
00:14:24,296 --> 00:14:25,661
Don't know... they are engaged
and then too for a kiss...

227
00:14:25,931 --> 00:14:27,728
Good night. - Good night.

228
00:14:52,324 --> 00:14:54,952
Are we engaged?
- What do you mean?

229
00:14:57,329 --> 00:14:59,126
Are we really engaged?

230
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:01,959
Grow up, Adi.
What are you saying?

231
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:06,627
I can't really believe this.
We are really engaged.

232
00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:11,969
O madam, please convince
him you are engaged.

233
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:17,808
Till he is not convinced, he will not
let anyone sleep. Can't believe! - Go to sleep.

234
00:15:19,351 --> 00:15:20,648
Gavin -Yeah!

235
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:23,321
What kind of smell
is this? Stinking!

236
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:27,825
Excuse me please. - Yes sir.

237
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:28,994
What kind of smell is this?

238
00:15:29,528 --> 00:15:30,825
I will check out.

239
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:31,997
It is really stinking.

240
00:15:32,531 --> 00:15:34,658
It must surely be some Indian.
- What happened?

241
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:37,665
They should know. These days
everything is available...

242
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:39,337
...everywhere but they still
move around with shop loads.

243
00:15:39,705 --> 00:15:42,173
Disgusting! - Disgusting!

244
00:15:42,374 --> 00:15:45,002
Excuse me, sir. Is this your bag?

245
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,678
How happy would your sister be
that you are going to Canada!

246
00:15:51,383 --> 00:15:52,680
Am I going to take all this luggage?

247
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:55,854
You aren't going to carry it on your head.
You are going by plane.

248
00:15:56,055 --> 00:15:56,521
I won't take it.

249
00:15:56,722 --> 00:15:59,850
Take it without saying a word.
It is our love.

250
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:01,185
Add a few more kilos of love!

251
00:16:20,245 --> 00:16:21,212
These children!

252
00:16:21,413 --> 00:16:22,880
How cute are they when they cry!

253
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:28,215
But they don't like us sleeping.
I can't understand at all...

254
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:31,048
...why these people travel
with such little children.

255
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,720
As if you would leave
your kids behind!

256
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:41,057
Of course! Since we are talking
about it, we should make it clear.

257
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:45,732
I think we shouldn't think about kids
for 5-6 years after marriage.

258
00:16:46,105 --> 00:16:47,732
This is the time for our careers.

259
00:16:48,273 --> 00:16:52,733
And I don't think we are ready
for kids. At least I'm not.

260
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,256
Sonia. - Yes.

261
00:17:08,394 --> 00:17:10,259
Sonia, this is the
passport and ticket. - Ok.

262
00:17:10,462 --> 00:17:13,590
And call up Simran
when you reach Paris.

263
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:14,595
Ok, I'll do it. - Ok.

264
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,097
But you don't forget your workouts.

265
00:17:16,301 --> 00:17:20,931
I hate unfit people and this
T-Shirt looks cool on you.

266
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,767
I'll get you some more.
- Ok, thank you.

267
00:17:22,975 --> 00:17:23,441
Ok, I'll leave then.

268
00:17:23,642 --> 00:17:27,442
And listen... Have a safe
flight and take care.

269
00:17:27,646 --> 00:17:28,772
I'll do that. Bye!

270
00:17:32,985 --> 00:17:34,782
You too take care, Aditya.

271
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,459
Uncle! - Hey Dumpy.

272
00:17:42,694 --> 00:17:45,458
What is this, uncle?
I sent you six emails.

273
00:17:45,664 --> 00:17:46,961
You didn't reply even to one.

274
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:49,964
I was busy with my female and
couldn't respond to your email.

275
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:51,295
Ok, sorry.

276
00:17:52,504 --> 00:17:55,302
Come soon. - There they are.

277
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:58,469
Adi! - Uncle! - Hey!
You are looking so young.

278
00:17:58,844 --> 00:18:02,143
Wait! Wait!
- My God I was scared!

279
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:04,975
How weak he has become,
isn't it Raabi!

280
00:18:05,184 --> 00:18:07,311
True! Raabi has become really weak.

281
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:10,977
Weak... thank you.
Did you hear? I've become weak.

282
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:13,158
Very funny. How is Sonia?

283
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:16,487
They all look good before marriage.

284
00:18:16,695 --> 00:18:17,992
Correct! - Right!

285
00:18:18,197 --> 00:18:19,164
Absolutely right.

286
00:18:19,398 --> 00:18:21,992
Correct? - No... wrong!
Absolutely wrong!

287
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:23,327
I mean Adi is wrong.

288
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:24,001
My brother is wrong?

289
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:24,669
That's me. - Yeah.

290
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:26,497
My luggage. - Ok.

291
00:18:26,705 --> 00:18:27,501
Both you brother and sister
are right. I am wrong.

292
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:31,339
No need to explain to me.
- Listen to me. Stop fighting.

293
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:34,171
How dare you touch my luggage!
- Sister. - This is my luggage.

294
00:18:34,379 --> 00:18:36,506
Leave it to me, Adi. I know how
to deal with these people.

295
00:18:36,715 --> 00:18:39,013
Sister, he is from my company.
- I will call the police.

296
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:40,515
Sister, he is from my company.
What are you doing?

297
00:18:40,719 --> 00:18:43,187
You are hitting him. What will
he think? He's come to pick me.

298
00:18:43,722 --> 00:18:44,518
He came to pick you?

299
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:48,348
Then who did we come here for?

300
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,858
You've indeed come for me.
But he is from my company.

301
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:53,190
He came to pick me up.
They've booked an apartment for me.

302
00:18:53,398 --> 00:18:54,865
I am in contract with them.
Why don't you understand?

303
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:55,533
Why don't you explain it to her?

304
00:18:55,734 --> 00:18:59,192
He is right. I know he is right.
- Then what was the need to come here?

305
00:18:59,404 --> 00:19:00,701
You could have got trained in Mumbai!

306
00:19:00,906 --> 00:19:04,535
Sister, do you think that
I like staying away from you? - Huh!

307
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:07,374
I will come over in the
weekends. Every Sunday.

308
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:09,046
We will enjoy ourselves.
We will go for picnics.

309
00:19:09,248 --> 00:19:11,716
We will go for lunches
and parties... everything.

310
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:17,219
C'mon sis... c'mon!
Try to understand, please.

311
00:19:18,757 --> 00:19:22,716
Hey man, why are you staring at me?
Take all this stuff. - What did you say?

312
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:25,890
Take the luggage and
take him also. - Ok, c'mon.

313
00:19:27,432 --> 00:19:29,730
I'll meet you overthe weekend.
Mom sent pickle foryou.

314
00:19:29,935 --> 00:19:30,401
I'll get that too. - It's ok.

315
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:36,236
So you seem like
quite a family man.

316
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:39,737
Ya, unfortunately
I've to stay alone.

317
00:19:40,445 --> 00:19:43,243
No... you have a roommate.
- A roommate!?

318
00:19:58,463 --> 00:20:02,263
Welcome... I am Nawab Sharif.

319
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:06,933
I am a gentleman only
by name and not by actions.

320
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,267
I am from Pakistan.
Any problems?

321
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:13,611
Aditya Malhotra.
- Great!

322
00:20:13,812 --> 00:20:15,439
Nice meeting you.
- I too feel great to meet you.

323
00:20:18,483 --> 00:20:19,950
Welcome Aditya, welcome to Canada.

324
00:20:20,152 --> 00:20:21,949
Thank you, sir.
- Let me show you. - Sure, sir.

325
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:26,122
You know we have the
biggest dealership in Canada.

326
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:27,451
Look at our showroom.

327
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:30,127
The best showroom ever in Canada.

328
00:20:41,006 --> 00:20:43,133
Aditya, you want to test drive?
Let's go ahead.

329
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:54,984
Take it easy.

330
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:01,159
Come on Nawab!

331
00:21:07,366 --> 00:21:08,333
Oh boy!

332
00:21:27,886 --> 00:21:30,013
Aditya, you drive well.
- Thank you.

333
00:21:30,555 --> 00:21:32,455
Buddy, was this a test drive
or were you taking revenge...

334
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:33,682
...against me forthe Kargil war?

335
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:35,856
Adi! You know what
I was thinking? - Sir!

336
00:21:36,061 --> 00:21:38,859
Why don't you represent us
in cross country rally?

337
00:21:39,064 --> 00:21:40,531
I would love to do that, sir.
- O beautiful!

338
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:46,037
Hang on. - Oh! Sorry.

339
00:21:55,247 --> 00:22:02,050
If you take your hand off the button...
the lift will move. - Sorry! - Its alright.

340
00:22:22,107 --> 00:22:24,735
Linda! - Daddy!

341
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:26,235
Oh! FBI has done its Job.

342
00:22:28,447 --> 00:22:30,745
Right... right...
- No, left... left...

343
00:22:30,949 --> 00:22:32,416
Are you going out?
- No, why?

344
00:22:32,617 --> 00:22:33,743
Then why are you looking
like a Christmas tree?

345
00:22:34,619 --> 00:22:35,244
Adi! Eat the snacks.

346
00:22:35,454 --> 00:22:38,753
Mom, what are you doing?
- It is Nawab's peg.

347
00:22:39,124 --> 00:22:43,424
I know that it is liquor.
It is not a milk drinking age.

348
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:46,592
Kitty, aunty cannot hear well.

349
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:49,595
But granny can see quite well. Mama!

350
00:22:50,635 --> 00:22:56,596
I am gone. It is the last chance
to save the princess. - Excuse me.

351
00:22:57,142 --> 00:22:58,769
How does this start?

352
00:22:59,144 --> 00:23:01,772
It is paused. If you take your
hand off the button it will play.

353
00:23:03,148 --> 00:23:06,117
'if you take your hand off the button...
the lift will move. - Sorry! '

354
00:23:09,688 --> 00:23:10,950
Left... left... Right... right...

355
00:23:11,156 --> 00:23:13,283
Yes, yes, I am trying
to save it. Yeah.

356
00:23:18,497 --> 00:23:19,464
Thank you.

357
00:23:22,501 --> 00:23:23,798
Oh, my cake! - What?

358
00:23:24,503 --> 00:23:27,131
I am really sorry.
I didn't realise I was Just walking...

359
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:28,135
...and I will Just clean it up.

360
00:23:28,673 --> 00:23:30,800
What are you doing? It's okay.

361
00:23:31,009 --> 00:23:32,977
I am really sorry.
My apartment is there.

362
00:23:33,178 --> 00:23:34,805
You can clean up
the mess there. Come!

363
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,476
No, its okay. Thank you.
I'll manage.

364
00:23:36,681 --> 00:23:38,308
Are you sure? - Yeah!
- Are you sure?

365
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:39,817
Hey! Nice dress!

366
00:23:40,018 --> 00:23:41,485
Get it from the bakery shop.

367
00:23:43,522 --> 00:23:48,323
Sorry, it is all because of me.
My offer is still open... please!

368
00:23:57,202 --> 00:23:57,827
You look beautiful!

369
00:23:59,204 --> 00:24:00,330
It is good that
you accepted my advice.

370
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:02,507
Those children made
a cake shop of you.

371
00:24:02,707 --> 00:24:03,674
Will you have cream biscuits?

372
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:06,343
No, I am getting late.
I've got to be leaving.

373
00:24:06,711 --> 00:24:08,508
Will you drink something? - No.

374
00:24:09,214 --> 00:24:10,340
Coke? - No!

375
00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:11,675
Orange Juice? - No!

376
00:24:11,883 --> 00:24:14,181
Tomato Juice?
- This is tomato ketchup.

377
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:18,184
Why do you always say no?
- Nothing like that.

378
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:20,357
You Just said no.

379
00:24:22,894 --> 00:24:25,192
Your cake fell down
because of me.

380
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:28,024
And I was thinking that
your clothes got spoilt because of me.

381
00:24:28,233 --> 00:24:30,030
You reduced my guilt by saying that.

382
00:24:30,235 --> 00:24:32,203
Why feel guilty? It was an accident.

383
00:24:32,571 --> 00:24:33,538
I don't think so.

384
00:24:33,772 --> 00:24:36,707
I think that whatever
happens is all a master plan.

385
00:24:37,242 --> 00:24:39,210
It's all destiny.
What do you think?

386
00:24:40,745 --> 00:24:45,045
No. Suppose that you get
run over by a bus tomorrow.

387
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:46,217
Ya... thanks why not?

388
00:24:46,418 --> 00:24:50,718
I said suppose... it will be
because you weren't watchful.

389
00:24:51,256 --> 00:24:53,224
It would not be because
of a master plan.

390
00:24:53,792 --> 00:24:57,558
So you mean to say that your coming
to this apartment is not destiny? Right?

391
00:24:58,263 --> 00:25:03,223
No. It is because we both
took our eyes off the path.

392
00:25:03,435 --> 00:25:05,403
That's why we bumped
into each other.

393
00:25:05,604 --> 00:25:08,903
But we both taking our eyes off
and that too at this time...

394
00:25:09,107 --> 00:25:10,904
Don't you think so?
That's destiny.

395
00:25:12,444 --> 00:25:15,072
May be! Anyway thanks
for everything.

396
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,406
I must be going now.

397
00:25:16,615 --> 00:25:17,240
Okay. - Bye!

398
00:25:17,449 --> 00:25:21,749
Are you sure you don't want
to drink? - No. Thank you. Bye!

399
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:29,919
O my God! I am sorry.
The door was actually open.

400
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:31,260
I left my bag.

401
00:25:31,463 --> 00:25:32,930
Never mind. Go and take your bag.

402
00:25:33,632 --> 00:25:35,099
Are you okay?
- Absolutely! Go!

403
00:25:35,634 --> 00:25:40,936
Your nose? - Destiny! Go!
- Really sorry.

404
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:49,947
Take this.

405
00:25:50,148 --> 00:25:52,946
What is this for? Oh, thank you.

406
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,287
Take care of yourself.

407
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:08,624
She's back. -What brother? Wow!

408
00:26:24,849 --> 00:26:27,818
Yes, I got the message.
Actually I was busy.

409
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:30,317
Never mind! At least
we are now talking.

410
00:26:30,855 --> 00:26:35,155
I am trying to be busy.
Shopping is so boring sometimes.

411
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,658
Thank God! I can never
handle shopping.

412
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:39,827
I'm overloaded with work.

413
00:26:40,198 --> 00:26:41,495
Some people are so lucky.

414
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:44,164
They avoid all their
duties in the name of work.

415
00:26:44,369 --> 00:26:46,997
Excuse me, I am not
giving any excuse.

416
00:26:47,205 --> 00:26:48,331
Actually I was very busy.

417
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:50,667
I don't know how truthful you are.

418
00:26:50,875 --> 00:26:53,503
But your sister is waiting
here with a sword in hand.

419
00:26:53,712 --> 00:26:56,180
What are you saying!?
- Ho... ho... well!

420
00:26:56,381 --> 00:26:58,008
You fool, where are you speaking from?

421
00:26:58,216 --> 00:26:59,183
I am speaking from my mouth.

422
00:26:59,384 --> 00:27:02,353
Very funny! I was cooking your
favourites since three days.

423
00:27:02,554 --> 00:27:05,682
Come soon or I'll never
talk to you in this life.

424
00:27:05,924 --> 00:27:08,017
So you are now threatening me.

425
00:27:08,226 --> 00:27:10,353
I don't know why
I don't get such threats.

426
00:27:11,062 --> 00:27:12,029
Very funny!

427
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:17,864
It's not funny any more, Jennifer.
You don't understand.

428
00:27:18,069 --> 00:27:21,869
Shopping alone like this...
and Karan is just not bothered.

429
00:27:22,073 --> 00:27:27,033
C'mon Jia! Don't sound so low.
Is there any girl in this world...

430
00:27:27,245 --> 00:27:28,712
...who is bored of shopping?

431
00:27:28,913 --> 00:27:32,713
And that too when she is shopping for
her marriage. - Excuse me, please sign this.

432
00:27:32,917 --> 00:27:34,885
I tell you what let's change places.

433
00:27:35,253 --> 00:27:40,054
I'll do the shopping foryou
and you become the PAto Karan.

434
00:27:41,593 --> 00:27:44,391
At least you'll get
closerto yourfiancée.

435
00:27:44,629 --> 00:27:46,062
What do you say? - Oh, yeah!

436
00:27:46,264 --> 00:27:48,892
Okay... take care. - You too.

437
00:28:03,782 --> 00:28:05,750
Oh, I am sorry. - Its okay.

438
00:28:28,807 --> 00:28:31,776
Oops! - Sorry... I... You?

439
00:28:32,811 --> 00:28:36,770
Twice! I think we should
learn to shake hands.

440
00:28:37,482 --> 00:28:41,612
Aditya Malhotra! - Jia...
Jia Yashvardhan!

441
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,788
What a unique name! Jia...
Jia Yashvardhan! Very nice!

442
00:28:43,988 --> 00:28:48,288
Not twice. Just Jia. It's ok. Thanks.

443
00:28:48,493 --> 00:28:50,120
Let me help you.
- No... really it's fine.

444
00:28:50,328 --> 00:28:51,955
There must be some
punishment for bumping in.

445
00:28:54,833 --> 00:28:58,291
Tell me one thing.
Whenever I meet you why do you carry...

446
00:28:58,503 --> 00:29:00,471
...so many bags?
Do you do smuggling?

447
00:29:00,672 --> 00:29:01,468
No! Shopping!

448
00:29:01,673 --> 00:29:03,641
I mean what do you do
besides shopping?

449
00:29:04,175 --> 00:29:08,805
I Just keep shopping
on various pretexts.

450
00:29:09,047 --> 00:29:09,979
Oh, nice Job!

451
00:29:11,015 --> 00:29:12,141
And you. And what do you do?

452
00:29:13,017 --> 00:29:16,145
Are you asking me what
I do besides bumping into you?

453
00:29:16,354 --> 00:29:17,651
Do you never get serious?

454
00:29:17,856 --> 00:29:19,483
I would be in a hospital
if I became serious.

455
00:29:19,691 --> 00:29:21,158
But not going around
with you in a mall.

456
00:29:22,694 --> 00:29:24,491
I like your smile. - Thanks.

457
00:29:24,729 --> 00:29:26,492
You didn't tell me what you do.

458
00:29:27,198 --> 00:29:33,831
I work hard. I help people.
I bump into them, pick up their bags...

459
00:29:34,038 --> 00:29:36,165
...and drop them to their
vehicles. That's my Job.

460
00:29:36,374 --> 00:29:39,002
Please pick up our bags too.

461
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,839
Ghuggi... Ghuggi...

462
00:29:44,415 --> 00:29:49,853
I am coming. How are you?
- I am fine.

463
00:29:50,221 --> 00:29:52,018
What are you doing here?
- I am getting trained.

464
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:54,187
Do you need training
even for this Job?

465
00:29:54,392 --> 00:29:55,859
Didn't you get trained in college?

466
00:29:56,728 --> 00:29:58,525
Greetings! - Greetings!

467
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:04,532
We are not friends
Just from happy days.

468
00:30:06,404 --> 00:30:07,371
We are friends even before that.

469
00:30:07,572 --> 00:30:08,869
Sis-in-law! - Sis-in-law?

470
00:30:09,073 --> 00:30:11,541
You used to have a girl friend
at college. What's her name?

471
00:30:11,776 --> 00:30:14,370
Pammi! - Yes, Pammi!
He had a girl friend in college.

472
00:30:14,579 --> 00:30:15,204
What happened to her?

473
00:30:15,413 --> 00:30:17,040
Now she is not my girl friend.

474
00:30:17,248 --> 00:30:20,217
Thank God! You are lucky that
she is not your girl friend.

475
00:30:20,418 --> 00:30:20,884
What do you mean?

476
00:30:21,085 --> 00:30:23,883
Except you and a few other guys...

477
00:30:24,088 --> 00:30:25,885
...she had affairs with everyone
else in college. She is...

478
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:27,557
She is my wife now.

479
00:30:28,092 --> 00:30:30,720
She is beautiful... she is nice...
she was very good... she was...

480
00:30:30,929 --> 00:30:33,227
Excuse me! - Ghuggi! Ghuggi!

481
00:30:35,934 --> 00:30:38,061
You should not have spoken like that.

482
00:30:39,938 --> 00:30:44,898
I was just Joking. Unnecessarily he got
angry. But the matter became serious.

483
00:30:45,944 --> 00:30:46,569
Aditya!

484
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:53,076
ParamJeet?

485
00:30:53,451 --> 00:30:58,912
Yes, ParamJeet... Pammi!

486
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:02,919
What do you think of yourself?
Just shooting off your mouth!

487
00:31:06,464 --> 00:31:08,932
When did you see me
roaming with other guys?

488
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:12,260
Sis-in-law! - Sis-in-law!?

489
00:31:13,805 --> 00:31:16,103
Now you are giving me respect.

490
00:31:16,808 --> 00:31:19,606
What happened to all that
when you maligned me...

491
00:31:19,844 --> 00:31:21,607
...in front of Sardar-Ji?

492
00:31:23,815 --> 00:31:24,440
Sis-in-law! I was Just Joking.

493
00:31:25,984 --> 00:31:28,953
It takes just a minute
to break a relation.

494
00:31:30,154 --> 00:31:36,115
But takes a life time
building them. And you...

495
00:31:38,162 --> 00:31:42,462
Where has Sardar-Ji gone?
Sardar-Ji!

496
00:32:05,189 --> 00:32:07,316
I am sorry, sister.
I lost my brother.

497
00:32:07,525 --> 00:32:09,993
I am sorry, brother,
I lost my husband.

498
00:32:10,528 --> 00:32:13,986
We are moments away from starting.

499
00:32:14,699 --> 00:32:17,327
Can I have the mike?
I have to say few words.

500
00:32:17,535 --> 00:32:19,002
Please, sir. Please!

501
00:32:19,871 --> 00:32:21,338
Stop her! Hey stop!

502
00:32:21,873 --> 00:32:23,841
Okay. - No! No! Listen to me!
Listen to me!

503
00:32:25,209 --> 00:32:26,836
Hey! I know this lady.

504
00:32:27,045 --> 00:32:28,012
Where are you?

505
00:32:30,048 --> 00:32:31,675
Please, my dear!
Don't do this to me.

506
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:36,008
Otherwise... otherwise
I swear by you... I will kill myself.

507
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:40,179
Where are you? I say,
where are you?

508
00:32:43,728 --> 00:32:47,357
Sorry ladies and gentleman
for interrupting your evening.

509
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:51,026
Today this lady who is standing
beside me...

510
00:32:51,235 --> 00:32:54,363
...needs your help to
reassure her husband...

511
00:32:54,906 --> 00:32:56,373
...what the meaning
of true love is!

512
00:32:56,908 --> 00:32:59,877
It's because of my ignorance
I caused her husband...

513
00:33:00,578 --> 00:33:03,046
...to suspect, doubt and
question his wife.

514
00:33:03,581 --> 00:33:05,208
I know that
you are listening to me.

515
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:10,550
You are so fortunate that
you have got such a loving wife.

516
00:33:11,756 --> 00:33:17,388
But you are unlucky that
you don't have faith in her love.

517
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:23,230
How can anyone listen to
stray words and doubt his love?

518
00:33:23,768 --> 00:33:26,896
There is no room for doubt in love.

519
00:33:27,939 --> 00:33:32,899
Where there is love there
should only be love. Only love!

520
00:33:33,111 --> 00:33:36,410
You too cannot remain happy
entertaining such doubt.

521
00:33:36,614 --> 00:33:39,742
If anyone of you find him around
please make him understand.

522
00:33:40,284 --> 00:33:44,584
That it is not worth breaking
the relationship for such small things.

523
00:33:44,789 --> 00:33:46,086
This is his photograph.

524
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:48,258
Please, cameraman!
Can you zoom on it?

525
00:33:48,793 --> 00:33:49,418
Okay. - Okay.

526
00:33:51,295 --> 00:33:57,757
Please, I beg all of you to
spread the magic of love everywhere.

527
00:33:58,136 --> 00:34:00,764
Whatever I said earlier was a Joke.

528
00:34:01,305 --> 00:34:04,274
But whatever I said now is the truth.
That is the only truth.

529
00:34:04,642 --> 00:34:08,442
Pammi! Pammi!

530
00:34:27,832 --> 00:34:29,800
You are one and I am one.

531
00:34:30,034 --> 00:34:32,969
And we have God's blessings on us.

532
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:36,131
We both should embrace
each othertightly.

533
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:39,468
And the one who releases
the embrace first will be a deceiver.

534
00:34:40,178 --> 00:34:41,805
Thank God, both of them united again.

535
00:34:52,657 --> 00:34:56,115
'There is no room for doubt in love.'

536
00:34:56,327 --> 00:35:00,787
'Where there is love there
should only be love. Only love! '

537
00:35:04,502 --> 00:35:06,299
Hello! - Hello, Jia! How are you?

538
00:35:06,737 --> 00:35:08,637
Jenny! Where is Karan?

539
00:35:08,873 --> 00:35:11,467
He is in meeting as usual.
It's a big business deal.

540
00:35:13,678 --> 00:35:14,804
How romantic!

541
00:35:15,179 --> 00:35:18,307
Oh, come on Jia!
Just think from his side.

542
00:35:18,516 --> 00:35:20,643
He wants to buy all
the happiness in this world foryou.

543
00:35:20,852 --> 00:35:22,649
Happiness cannot be bought, Jenny.

544
00:35:23,521 --> 00:35:26,319
He promised me to come with
me to shop forthe marriage.

545
00:35:26,524 --> 00:35:29,322
You know... that he never
bought anything else...

546
00:35:29,527 --> 00:35:31,154
...except factories and shares?

547
00:35:33,231 --> 00:35:33,993
I know.

548
00:35:34,699 --> 00:35:36,166
Karan loves you a lot, Jia.

549
00:35:36,901 --> 00:35:42,498
But the problem is
he doesn't know how to express it.

550
00:35:43,541 --> 00:35:46,510
Anyway, tell me
what shopping you did today.

551
00:35:46,777 --> 00:35:48,506
I bought a book for Karan.

552
00:35:49,113 --> 00:35:52,344
40 Landscapes... Sports cars?

553
00:35:52,717 --> 00:35:55,015
40 Landscapes. Wow!

554
00:36:02,393 --> 00:36:12,394
UTV

555
00:36:56,948 --> 00:37:00,748
"Destroyed!
This heart is destroyed."

556
00:37:00,985 --> 00:37:05,081
"Destroyed!
This heart is destroyed."

557
00:37:05,289 --> 00:37:09,589
"Destroyed!
This heart is destroyed."

558
00:37:13,631 --> 00:37:15,428
"O Lord, now take away this life."

559
00:37:15,633 --> 00:37:17,430
"Take away this morality."

560
00:37:17,635 --> 00:37:19,432
"Take away these worlds."

561
00:37:21,639 --> 00:37:23,766
"O Lord, now take away this life."

562
00:37:23,975 --> 00:37:25,602
"Take away this morality."

563
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:27,778
"Take away these worlds."

564
00:37:30,314 --> 00:37:34,273
"Destroyed! This heart is destroyed."

565
00:37:34,552 --> 00:37:39,956
"Destroyed! This heart is destroyed."

566
00:38:04,248 --> 00:38:08,150
"Every moment is filled
with a passion foryou."

567
00:38:08,352 --> 00:38:12,152
"There is no respite."

568
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:16,492
"You fill my dreams and thoughts."

569
00:38:16,861 --> 00:38:20,490
"How can I describe this madness?"

570
00:38:20,698 --> 00:38:24,657
"Love is pervades all over."

571
00:38:24,869 --> 00:38:28,828
"Nothing else can
be seen anywhere."

572
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:32,999
"Your voice resonates
in everything."

573
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:37,010
"Nothing else except
that can be heard."

574
00:38:41,218 --> 00:38:43,015
"O Lord, now take away this life."

575
00:38:43,387 --> 00:38:45,014
"Take away this morality."

576
00:38:45,389 --> 00:38:47,016
"Take away these worlds."

577
00:38:49,393 --> 00:38:51,361
"O Lord, now take away this life."

578
00:38:51,729 --> 00:38:53,526
"Take away this morality."

579
00:38:53,731 --> 00:38:55,528
"Take away these worlds."

580
00:38:58,235 --> 00:39:02,035
"Destroyed! This heart
is destroyed."

581
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:06,539
"Destroyed! This heart
is destroyed."

582
00:39:06,777 --> 00:39:10,873
"Destroyed! This heart is destroyed."

583
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:56,920
"I soak in your
intoxication every moment."

584
00:39:57,128 --> 00:40:00,928
"This heart is enchanted with you."

585
00:40:01,132 --> 00:40:05,091
"The heart beats restlessly."

586
00:40:05,302 --> 00:40:08,931
"What do you know about my state?"

587
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:13,270
"At times on the sky
and at times on the earth...

588
00:40:13,477 --> 00:40:17,436
...yourface appears
in front of me."

589
00:40:17,648 --> 00:40:21,607
"I am so lost in love...

590
00:40:21,819 --> 00:40:26,119
...that I no longer worry
about the consequences."

591
00:40:29,827 --> 00:40:31,795
"O Lord, now take
away this life."

592
00:40:31,996 --> 00:40:33,964
"Take away this morality."

593
00:40:34,198 --> 00:40:37,793
"Take away these worlds."

594
00:40:38,169 --> 00:40:40,137
"O Lord, now take
away this life."

595
00:40:40,337 --> 00:40:42,134
"Take away this morality."

596
00:40:42,339 --> 00:40:44,307
"Take away these worlds."

597
00:40:46,844 --> 00:40:50,803
"Destroyed! This heart
is destroyed."

598
00:40:51,015 --> 00:40:54,974
"Destroyed! This heart
is destroyed."

599
00:40:55,186 --> 00:40:59,486
"Destroyed! This heart
is destroyed."

600
00:41:31,789 --> 00:41:32,756
What are you thinking?

601
00:41:33,123 --> 00:41:34,920
What? - What are you thinking?

602
00:41:37,628 --> 00:41:39,095
Tell me something, Nawab.

603
00:41:39,964 --> 00:41:42,592
Did your God make only
one woman for every man?

604
00:41:46,303 --> 00:41:48,271
Buddy! He made two girls for me.

605
00:41:49,607 --> 00:41:53,065
First one came to my life
and took away all my money.

606
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:56,768
The second one came and saw
that I didn't have any money.

607
00:41:57,481 --> 00:41:59,949
So she took my heart and went away.

608
00:42:00,484 --> 00:42:02,281
She didn't return it till now.

609
00:42:02,887 --> 00:42:05,947
Now I will sell this remaining body
to go to Pakistan.

610
00:42:07,324 --> 00:42:08,291
Hey, what can I get foryou?

611
00:42:09,493 --> 00:42:11,120
For the moment same stuff continue.

612
00:42:11,328 --> 00:42:12,795
And you, sir? - What?

613
00:42:12,997 --> 00:42:14,464
He will have that girl.
The one in pink.

614
00:42:15,833 --> 00:42:17,801
Its totally full, ma'am.
- Oh I see.

615
00:42:18,168 --> 00:42:20,830
I am afraid we can't serve dishes
that are out of our kitchen.

616
00:42:21,672 --> 00:42:23,469
No. I am okay with this.
Thank you.

617
00:42:24,174 --> 00:42:25,971
You have to wait for 15 minutes.

618
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:31,147
Are you still thinking?

619
00:42:32,583 --> 00:42:33,982
No, buddy. Are you mad?

620
00:42:34,518 --> 00:42:35,109
Okay... I'm Just coming!

621
00:42:35,185 --> 00:42:36,982
Where are you going?
- To the washroom.

622
00:42:38,956 --> 00:42:41,015
I'll wait here then.
- Okay fine.

623
00:42:42,526 --> 00:42:47,156
Aditya, I shall go now.
Pay the bill. - Okay.

624
00:42:47,364 --> 00:42:50,333
Hi! - Jia!? Hi... Hi... - Hi!

625
00:42:50,534 --> 00:42:51,330
Why are you here?

626
00:42:52,036 --> 00:42:55,995
Me? I came for dinner.
He said that I have to wait.

627
00:42:56,373 --> 00:42:58,500
Okay, why don't you Join me?

628
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:00,540
Are you sure? - Yes, sure.

629
00:43:01,045 --> 00:43:02,171
Okay. - Come.

630
00:43:07,952 --> 00:43:10,853
So, this is our third
unscheduled meeting.

631
00:43:11,055 --> 00:43:14,354
What to say? Is this an
accident or a coincidence?

632
00:43:14,625 --> 00:43:17,355
I'll still say that it's destiny.

633
00:43:18,295 --> 00:43:21,059
Hey! EnJoy yourself.
It's our 25th wedding anniversary.

634
00:43:21,231 --> 00:43:23,859
Congratulations... - Thanks!

635
00:43:25,069 --> 00:43:26,866
Indian? - Yes, of course!

636
00:43:27,237 --> 00:43:28,363
You both look so good together.

637
00:43:28,572 --> 00:43:29,869
How many years
it is since you are married?

638
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:31,369
No... no, we are not married.

639
00:43:31,575 --> 00:43:32,701
Then when are you getting married?

640
00:43:33,077 --> 00:43:33,543
Oh, no! No...

641
00:43:33,744 --> 00:43:37,043
Actually I am already engaged.
My wedding is on September 25th.

642
00:43:37,247 --> 00:43:37,872
I see!

643
00:43:39,583 --> 00:43:44,384
And mine is in October.
Exactly 15 days after her marriage.

644
00:43:45,923 --> 00:43:48,221
Actually we are...
we are Just friends.

645
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:49,221
Oh, that's more important.

646
00:43:50,594 --> 00:43:52,391
Normally my guess
never goes wrong.

647
00:43:53,263 --> 00:43:54,389
I don't know how
that happened this time.

648
00:43:54,665 --> 00:43:56,724
Anyway come on, let's dance.

649
00:44:08,112 --> 00:44:11,240
What is it that keeps
them together even after...

650
00:44:11,448 --> 00:44:13,575
...so many years of marriage?

651
00:44:17,955 --> 00:44:20,924
Feelings. - Feelings?

652
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:26,259
A feeling is just what unites us.

653
00:44:27,631 --> 00:44:31,931
Our relationship is alive
so long as this feeling is alive.

654
00:44:32,136 --> 00:44:33,933
Our love too is alive
because of that.

655
00:44:34,138 --> 00:44:35,765
The day when this feeling...

656
00:45:40,370 --> 00:45:41,337
Oh, it is very cold today.

657
00:45:41,538 --> 00:45:44,507
Yes, it's cold. Quite chilly!

658
00:45:44,641 --> 00:45:47,303
Yes, you shouldn't have come out.

659
00:45:47,544 --> 00:45:49,341
I am afraid you might catch a cold.

660
00:45:50,781 --> 00:45:51,839
You want my Jacket?

661
00:45:52,216 --> 00:45:54,514
No. Its okay. Taxi...

662
00:45:56,386 --> 00:45:59,355
I don't think any taxi will stop.
It is very late.

663
00:46:01,792 --> 00:46:06,195
If you want I will come with you
to the hotel. If you want.

664
00:46:06,396 --> 00:46:07,863
No, it's okay. I will manage.

665
00:46:08,065 --> 00:46:09,032
Are you sure? - Yes.

666
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:10,358
Okay. - Bye! - Bye!

667
00:46:12,236 --> 00:46:18,197
1, 2, 3, 4, 5...

668
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:21,373
Aditya!

669
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:24,206
Yes. What happened, Jia?

670
00:46:25,749 --> 00:46:28,547
Shall we go together? - Sure!

671
00:46:35,826 --> 00:46:37,054
See this. - What?

672
00:46:37,261 --> 00:46:39,388
See what's written here. - Oh!

673
00:46:41,932 --> 00:46:49,896
John loves SuJi, Mr. And
Mrs. Smith, for the one I love...

674
00:46:52,442 --> 00:46:57,573
It feels good when the names of
two people in love are written.

675
00:46:57,948 --> 00:47:01,577
Yes, some lovers
don't want to get separated.

676
00:47:05,289 --> 00:47:08,588
I never thought that we would meet
like this in this unknown country.

677
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:13,088
You won't let anyone
remain a stranger. - Yes.

678
00:47:22,139 --> 00:47:23,606
Why do people whistle?

679
00:47:24,308 --> 00:47:25,775
People passing by will stop.

680
00:47:26,877 --> 00:47:27,935
Come on!

681
00:47:33,483 --> 00:47:34,950
Hotel Sheraton. - Yes sir.

682
00:47:39,223 --> 00:47:41,453
By sitting on this chariot
I remembered Marine drive.

683
00:47:41,658 --> 00:47:42,784
Did you ever go to Mumbai?

684
00:47:43,327 --> 00:47:45,625
What do you mean...
I am from Mumbai.

685
00:47:45,829 --> 00:47:47,456
And that too from Marine drive!

686
00:47:47,664 --> 00:47:48,289
Don't tell me!

687
00:47:48,498 --> 00:47:50,466
Last year we shifted to Bandra.

688
00:47:50,667 --> 00:47:52,294
I too stay at Marine drive.

689
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:54,295
Do you know the
restaurant Barista?

690
00:47:54,504 --> 00:47:55,471
Just behind it.

691
00:47:55,672 --> 00:47:57,299
No way. I used to go
there all the time.

692
00:47:57,441 --> 00:47:59,341
And my favourite order
was French vanilla...

693
00:48:02,012 --> 00:48:03,309
What a small world!

694
00:48:08,252 --> 00:48:12,154
We may have crossed
each other a thousand times.

695
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:16,159
I don't think so. - Why?

696
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:21,991
If I ever crossed you,
I would have stood still.

697
00:48:22,699 --> 00:48:23,996
I wouldn't still be moving.

698
00:48:35,045 --> 00:48:36,842
Stop! - Yes.

699
00:48:41,551 --> 00:48:44,850
Jia! - I have to go now.

700
00:49:03,907 --> 00:49:05,875
Give me the money.
Give me the money...

701
00:49:06,076 --> 00:49:08,203
Let me go... Let me go...

702
00:49:08,412 --> 00:49:11,506
Hey... hey. Don't...
don't... don't do that.

703
00:49:11,748 --> 00:49:15,445
You want the money...
you want the money...

704
00:49:15,686 --> 00:49:17,881
I will give you money.
Okay? Don't hurt her.

705
00:49:18,989 --> 00:49:20,047
Okay. Yes, there
is a lot of money.

706
00:49:20,257 --> 00:49:23,385
Here, c'mon take it.
Don't hurt her! Don't hurt her!

707
00:49:23,593 --> 00:49:26,892
Hey, take... don't do that...

708
00:49:27,097 --> 00:49:28,223
I told you don't hurt her.

709
00:49:33,603 --> 00:49:34,729
Aditya!

710
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:38,401
Guys! C'mon let's go.

711
00:49:45,949 --> 00:49:47,246
The cops are coming.

712
00:49:49,286 --> 00:49:50,583
The cops are coming.

713
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:08,100
It's me... okay...
please stop crying.

714
00:50:08,805 --> 00:50:10,773
It's okay. They have gone.

715
00:50:12,042 --> 00:50:14,772
Don't cry. Just take it easy.

716
00:50:14,978 --> 00:50:15,945
They have all gone.

717
00:50:16,146 --> 00:50:19,274
Stop it... Just calm down...
please! - Aditya!

718
00:50:19,483 --> 00:50:21,781
Take it easy... take it easy.
They have gone.

719
00:50:41,071 --> 00:50:42,629
We reached your hotel.

720
00:50:45,008 --> 00:50:45,770
Had you not been there...

721
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:47,002
How is that possible?

722
00:50:47,177 --> 00:50:50,635
I love to become superman.
How couldn't I come?

723
00:51:00,690 --> 00:51:02,658
Bye! - Bye!

724
00:52:01,918 --> 00:52:05,718
'if I ever crossed you,
I would have stood still.'

725
00:52:05,922 --> 00:52:07,389
'I wouldn't still be moving.'

726
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:19,728
Hello! - Aditya!

727
00:52:23,273 --> 00:52:26,572
Jia, is that you?
Is everything okay?

728
00:52:27,777 --> 00:52:32,077
Yes. I don't know why
but I wanted to talk to you.

729
00:52:34,117 --> 00:52:37,245
Sleep now, Jia.
It is very late in the night.

730
00:52:38,622 --> 00:52:41,750
We can talk tomorrow
morning. Good night!

731
00:52:44,461 --> 00:52:44,927
Good night!

732
00:52:57,307 --> 00:53:00,435
I don't know why nothing
works over here.

733
00:53:00,810 --> 00:53:02,437
Sir, will you have some coffee?

734
00:53:02,812 --> 00:53:05,280
Except forthis bloody
coffee machine!

735
00:53:05,815 --> 00:53:09,774
Look guys, we have one of
the best dealership over here.

736
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:12,784
We have the best cars
to sell. - Right.

737
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:14,957
But we don't sell the most. Why?

738
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:20,129
Yes, Mr. Sharif!
Why are you clapping for now?

739
00:53:20,363 --> 00:53:21,455
Sir, because the
growth of the company...

740
00:53:21,665 --> 00:53:23,792
Nothing grows here except your hair.

741
00:53:24,501 --> 00:53:26,128
And look at the cheap colour as well.

742
00:53:26,336 --> 00:53:28,804
And what about tomorrow's rally?
Are you ready forthat?

743
00:53:29,005 --> 00:53:30,472
Sir! We are trying our level best.

744
00:53:30,707 --> 00:53:32,971
I hope so everything
goes well tomorrow.

745
00:53:34,844 --> 00:53:37,312
Are you stupid, shut up?

746
00:53:39,249 --> 00:53:40,978
The boss' engine is very hot.

747
00:53:41,184 --> 00:53:44,483
Buddy, even our engine
is hot since two days.

748
00:53:48,858 --> 00:53:50,485
Hi! - Hi!

749
00:53:52,729 --> 00:53:53,320
Bye!

750
00:53:54,864 --> 00:53:56,991
What wrong, Aditya?
I've come to meet you.

751
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:58,997
Yes, but I can't meet you now.

752
00:53:59,202 --> 00:54:01,329
And my boss is very
angry right now.

753
00:54:01,538 --> 00:54:05,167
This vehicle is a superb one.
What are you doing?

754
00:54:05,375 --> 00:54:06,342
Why are you pushing me?

755
00:54:06,543 --> 00:54:08,511
I've come to kidnap you.
Let's go for lunch.

756
00:54:09,045 --> 00:54:12,344
Let's do one thing. I'll resign
and come. Then we'll go.

757
00:54:12,549 --> 00:54:13,174
Resign!?

758
00:54:13,383 --> 00:54:16,181
Before my boss throws me out
I'll come out on my own.

759
00:54:16,386 --> 00:54:17,011
What do you think?

760
00:54:18,622 --> 00:54:21,853
Boss! Do you speak Hindi?

761
00:54:22,058 --> 00:54:25,186
Yes, very well.
Show me this car.

762
00:54:26,062 --> 00:54:29,520
And ya... you are right...
very nice selection, ma'am.

763
00:54:29,733 --> 00:54:30,199
Let me help you.

764
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:33,198
Okay, you resign
and come. I'll wait.

765
00:54:35,071 --> 00:54:36,197
Sir! Excuse me!

766
00:54:36,406 --> 00:54:38,033
What happened?
Won't you resign?

767
00:54:39,409 --> 00:54:42,867
It is frustration here
and celebration at night.

768
00:54:43,079 --> 00:54:43,875
Where is the celebration?

769
00:54:44,414 --> 00:54:47,383
It is my nephew's birthday.
Look straight.

770
00:54:49,085 --> 00:54:50,712
We have to go to
the birthday party.

771
00:54:51,087 --> 00:54:52,554
What will I do there?

772
00:54:52,756 --> 00:54:55,054
They have called a few Jokers.
But they haven't turned up.

773
00:54:55,258 --> 00:54:56,384
I thought I'll take you along. - Okay.

774
00:54:56,593 --> 00:54:58,390
Yeah, that's right.
You like it.

775
00:54:59,095 --> 00:55:01,063
Done. - Done, sir. Done!

776
00:55:03,767 --> 00:55:06,565
Did you like the car?
- Yes, I liked it.

777
00:55:06,770 --> 00:55:10,069
Done! - Done!

778
00:55:10,273 --> 00:55:12,571
See you in the evening. - Done!

779
00:55:13,677 --> 00:55:14,905
They think I am a fool.

780
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:17,070
Hey, Dumpy! Happy birthday.

781
00:55:18,048 --> 00:55:19,345
I am late because
of your uncle.

782
00:55:19,549 --> 00:55:20,345
I'll leave. - Let's go.

783
00:55:20,550 --> 00:55:21,847
Uncle! - How are you?

784
00:55:22,452 --> 00:55:23,680
Happy birthday. - Thank you.

785
00:55:23,887 --> 00:55:26,185
She is Jia...
birthday boy Dumpy.

786
00:55:26,389 --> 00:55:28,186
Happy birthday, Dumpy. - Thank you.

787
00:55:29,259 --> 00:55:31,352
Uncle, where did you
get this parrot from?

788
00:55:32,395 --> 00:55:33,521
Keep quiet.

789
00:55:34,564 --> 00:55:39,866
Uncle! The bird is very cute.
Does she kiss or not?

790
00:55:40,236 --> 00:55:43,535
Have some shame. Have some shame.
What is your age?

791
00:55:44,074 --> 00:55:45,371
She has not even embraced me.

792
00:55:46,076 --> 00:55:48,044
You are mad. Stop your ranting.

793
00:55:48,244 --> 00:55:49,040
You don't even have manners.

794
00:55:49,245 --> 00:55:51,372
If not you make her kiss me.

795
00:55:51,581 --> 00:55:54,379
You will be beaten
along with your uncle.

796
00:55:54,584 --> 00:55:55,209
What's he saying?

797
00:55:57,587 --> 00:55:59,054
Are you talking about him? - Ya...

798
00:56:00,156 --> 00:56:04,786
He is saying in PunJabi that his
mother is very angry with us...

799
00:56:05,061 --> 00:56:06,460
...because we came very late.

800
00:56:07,497 --> 00:56:14,960
And this boy speaks a lot but his
granny is hard of hearing.

801
00:56:15,839 --> 00:56:17,466
Our family is very weird.

802
00:56:17,674 --> 00:56:20,973
So let's go inside and see
what will happen to us.

803
00:56:21,177 --> 00:56:22,804
Let's go in. - Come on.

804
00:56:23,179 --> 00:56:26,148
I say, have some more.
- What are you doing?

805
00:56:26,383 --> 00:56:28,476
Not a cool drink, get me some wine.

806
00:56:28,685 --> 00:56:29,982
No! No, we are not
allowed to serve.

807
00:56:31,688 --> 00:56:32,154
Raabi!

808
00:56:32,422 --> 00:56:34,151
Come on, don't be embarrassed.
Its okay.

809
00:56:34,891 --> 00:56:37,155
Hi, everybody! Hello! - Hi.

810
00:56:43,199 --> 00:56:45,497
Why is everyone looking
at me like that?

811
00:56:46,536 --> 00:56:47,662
It is not their mistake.

812
00:56:49,539 --> 00:56:50,836
I think they hate me.

813
00:56:51,107 --> 00:56:54,668
I won't let it happen.
Why are you looking like that?

814
00:56:55,545 --> 00:56:56,341
She is my friend.

815
00:56:56,546 --> 00:56:58,036
Can't I bring my
friend to a party?

816
00:56:58,481 --> 00:57:02,110
She is Jia... Jia...

817
00:57:02,318 --> 00:57:05,685
Jia Yashvardhan.
- Yes! Yes!

818
00:57:06,623 --> 00:57:08,750
She is my sister.
She is always angry.

819
00:57:09,092 --> 00:57:11,026
IJust came along to wish
Dumpy on his birthday.

820
00:57:11,227 --> 00:57:11,750
You don't mind.

821
00:57:11,961 --> 00:57:13,622
No! No! Not at all...
not at all...

822
00:57:13,830 --> 00:57:17,596
Look, mom... What Jia got for me...
Isn't it cool?

823
00:57:17,801 --> 00:57:19,701
Thank you so much... so sweet!

824
00:57:19,903 --> 00:57:21,029
Welcome... welcome...

825
00:57:21,237 --> 00:57:21,965
Thank you. - Thank you.

826
00:57:22,172 --> 00:57:23,764
Here comes your guest.

827
00:57:23,973 --> 00:57:25,941
They may be your guests. Not ours.

828
00:57:26,142 --> 00:57:29,373
Why do you get angry? Okay, sister.
I am sorry for being late.

829
00:57:29,579 --> 00:57:31,274
We are late because
she spent time in make-up.

830
00:57:31,481 --> 00:57:32,004
Make-up!?

831
00:57:32,215 --> 00:57:33,910
I mean, explain it to her.

832
00:57:34,117 --> 00:57:37,848
She always gets angry.
That is her way of showing love.

833
00:57:38,054 --> 00:57:40,215
Stop it. It is enough.

834
00:57:40,623 --> 00:57:43,490
Love can never be enough.
- The Rakhi festival is about to come.

835
00:57:43,693 --> 00:57:45,388
So, I think she needs
a lump sum amount.

836
00:57:45,995 --> 00:57:46,962
Adi, you too.

837
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,627
Oh! I don't get it even if I ask.

838
00:57:52,869 --> 00:57:55,133
Never mind! Get the Rakhi
tied and you too will get it.

839
00:58:06,216 --> 00:58:08,184
Rabbi... what a nice song...

840
00:58:15,792 --> 00:58:17,555
Jia, give me that curry. - Yes.

841
00:58:26,736 --> 00:58:27,498
Excuse me.

842
00:58:28,771 --> 00:58:32,537
Where are you going?
- We are Just going to the wash room.

843
00:58:32,742 --> 00:58:34,869
Come on soon before
the work is done.

844
00:58:35,612 --> 00:58:36,874
Raabi! - What, mom?

845
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:40,206
How come all three guys
want to shit together?

846
00:58:42,418 --> 00:58:44,443
He brought us to some party.

847
00:58:44,654 --> 00:58:46,212
Hi, Pammi! She was
in such a good mood.

848
00:58:46,422 --> 00:58:47,787
She said that
we should stay in a hotel.

849
00:58:47,991 --> 00:58:51,051
I was a fool to reject
such a hot offerfrom my wife...

850
00:58:51,261 --> 00:58:52,751
...and come to this cold party.

851
00:58:52,962 --> 00:58:54,896
No, buddy! You got
an offerfrom your wife.

852
00:58:55,098 --> 00:58:56,656
But I left an offer
from another's wife.

853
00:58:56,866 --> 00:58:57,924
Here there is neither
liquor nor beautiful women.

854
00:58:58,134 --> 00:58:58,691
Do something.

855
00:58:58,902 --> 00:59:00,631
What can I do? All of them
are bro-in-law's friends.

856
00:59:00,837 --> 00:59:01,929
They are all behaving
like English men.

857
00:59:02,138 --> 00:59:03,469
I'll teach a lesson
to these English men.

858
00:59:03,907 --> 00:59:04,805
One minute! One minute!

859
00:59:05,008 --> 00:59:06,066
Now it will be interesting.

860
00:59:07,176 --> 00:59:08,438
What are you doing,
will you drink?

861
00:59:08,645 --> 00:59:11,170
This is English stuff.
If everyone consumes it a little...

862
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:12,848
...the true nature will come out.

863
00:59:13,049 --> 00:59:14,949
You fool! Everyone
drinks Juice. - Take it.

864
00:59:15,151 --> 00:59:16,982
This is the age of adulteration.

865
00:59:17,186 --> 00:59:19,313
We'll mix it a little in the
Juice and no one will come to know.

866
00:59:19,522 --> 00:59:20,511
What a good plan!

867
00:59:20,723 --> 00:59:23,055
We have the same ideas
on both sides of the border.

868
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:24,924
Oh my gosh!

869
00:59:25,128 --> 00:59:26,220
My leg!

870
00:59:27,330 --> 00:59:29,821
My son has a hotel at
the top of the restaurant.

871
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:31,063
Shall I have the room opened?

872
00:59:31,267 --> 00:59:33,326
Aunty! We were discussing...
you misunderstood us.

873
00:59:33,536 --> 00:59:34,264
Were you kissing?

874
00:59:34,470 --> 00:59:39,271
Not kissing, aunty.
We were discussing.

875
00:59:39,475 --> 00:59:41,238
There is a conference
hall too above.

876
00:59:41,444 --> 00:59:42,775
Go and discuss there.

877
00:59:44,781 --> 00:59:47,249
Oh, my... disgusting people...

878
00:59:48,051 --> 00:59:50,178
Aunty! You misunderstood us.

879
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:52,445
Now we will mix in all the drinks.
Get the bottle.

880
00:59:55,592 --> 00:59:56,183
What are you doing?

881
00:59:56,392 --> 00:59:59,156
Drink it and see.
- How much will you make me drink?

882
00:59:59,362 --> 01:00:01,330
C'mon darling! It is plain Juice.

883
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:03,790
Give it to mom also.

884
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,797
No. This is sweet and
she will get sugar complaint.

885
01:00:06,002 --> 01:00:07,697
Nothing will happen
in one glass. Give it.

886
01:00:08,571 --> 01:00:09,367
As you wish.

887
01:00:10,239 --> 01:00:14,471
The Juice is okay foryou, mom.
It is not wine. Take it.

888
01:00:21,684 --> 01:00:22,378
One more.

889
01:00:22,585 --> 01:00:25,110
No. You have diabetes... please...

890
01:00:25,355 --> 01:00:26,014
Is this Juice your daddy's?

891
01:00:26,222 --> 01:00:27,985
No, it is orange Juice.
What will I lose?

892
01:00:28,191 --> 01:00:34,619
Wait... one more.

893
01:00:36,733 --> 01:00:40,965
One more. - Excuse me.

894
01:00:41,904 --> 01:00:51,870
UTV

895
01:01:07,196 --> 01:01:13,101
"What a watch out!
C'mon! C'mon!"

896
01:01:13,302 --> 01:01:15,099
"Taste it! Taste it!"

897
01:01:18,775 --> 01:01:21,767
"Hit the floor. Yeah!
Come on, burn the floor."

898
01:01:21,978 --> 01:01:25,846
"It's the time. Come on,
close the door."

899
01:01:26,783 --> 01:01:30,116
"The moon the stars,
the ambiance for your eyes only."

900
01:01:30,453 --> 01:01:34,116
"The pleasant clouds
for your eyes only."

901
01:01:34,490 --> 01:01:38,187
"The seven wonders of the
world are for your eyes only."

902
01:01:38,561 --> 01:01:42,292
"The riches of Jewels and
pearls are for your eyes only."

903
01:01:48,538 --> 01:02:02,714
"Alright! Live or die...
whatever I do is up to me."

904
01:02:02,919 --> 01:02:06,320
"The entire world is my heart."

905
01:02:06,522 --> 01:02:10,117
"The kohl of desire is formed
with the colours of my dreams."

906
01:02:10,326 --> 01:02:18,233
"For your eyes only.
For your eyes only..."

907
01:02:41,724 --> 01:02:46,661
"Enjoy the wonderful taste of love."

908
01:02:46,863 --> 01:02:50,799
"My dreams are now for
you only. Keep them."

909
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:54,697
"I will dedicate a
hundred lives foryou."

910
01:02:54,904 --> 01:02:57,429
"I swear by God that
I will die foryou. I will die."

911
01:02:58,407 --> 01:03:05,870
"For your eyes only.
For your eyes only."...

912
01:03:06,082 --> 01:03:09,984
"The pleasure of youth and
beauty tell a story...

913
01:03:10,419 --> 01:03:13,980
...the soft and secret way."

914
01:03:14,357 --> 01:03:18,555
"Convey your promises
to the beloved."

915
01:03:18,928 --> 01:03:22,625
"Don't make false promises."

916
01:03:22,832 --> 01:03:26,233
"The marriage band is passing by."

917
01:03:26,435 --> 01:03:30,633
"Emotional nights are
filled with words of love."

918
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:34,241
"The desires of the heart
are for your eyes only."

919
01:03:34,443 --> 01:03:42,350
"For your eyes only.
For your eyes only."...

920
01:03:51,394 --> 01:03:53,191
"I can see the look in your eyes."

921
01:03:53,396 --> 01:03:55,296
"Tell me, baby.
What you see?"

922
01:03:55,498 --> 01:03:59,264
"Can't you ever realize
you are for me?"

923
01:03:59,468 --> 01:04:01,459
"I can see the look in your eyes"

924
01:04:01,671 --> 01:04:06,233
"For your eyes only.
For your eyes only..."

925
01:04:06,442 --> 01:04:10,208
"The looks rise and fall."

926
01:04:10,413 --> 01:04:14,372
"These looks stop at your face."

927
01:04:14,584 --> 01:04:18,816
"The heart is pounding and
doesn't know what to do."

928
01:04:22,825 --> 01:04:26,784
"The Creator has made you
the most beautiful."

929
01:04:26,996 --> 01:04:34,334
"I want to stay quiet and
not say anything, my dear."

930
01:04:34,570 --> 01:04:42,341
"For your eyes only.
For your eyes only..."

931
01:04:42,545 --> 01:04:50,919
"Live or die... whatever
I do is up to me."

932
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:54,419
"The entire world is my heart."

933
01:04:54,624 --> 01:04:58,492
"The kohl of desire is formed
with the colours of my dreams."

934
01:05:02,598 --> 01:05:06,295
"For your eyes only.
For your eyes only..."

935
01:05:06,502 --> 01:05:10,370
"For your eyes only.
For your eyes only..."

936
01:05:10,606 --> 01:05:26,512
"For your eyes only.
For your eyes only..."

937
01:05:28,491 --> 01:05:30,959
Your uncle is a very
nice man. - I know.

938
01:05:31,494 --> 01:05:34,156
But you are nicerthan him.
- I know that too.

939
01:05:34,597 --> 01:05:38,693
Will you marry me? - No, I've already
promised someone else.

940
01:05:39,235 --> 01:05:42,762
Oh! You too have the same problem.

941
01:05:44,707 --> 01:05:47,369
But we can be friends, right? - Okay.

942
01:05:49,912 --> 01:05:52,642
Dumpy! Don't you want
a kiss from this lovely bird?

943
01:05:53,482 --> 01:06:00,650
You can kiss, isn't it?
- Yes! That's it!

944
01:06:12,335 --> 01:06:15,327
I didn't feel bad at all.
Don't be embarrassed.

945
01:06:15,705 --> 01:06:16,933
Stop, I am not embarrassed.

946
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:20,474
Rather I am happy that
you speak Punjabi so well.

947
01:06:21,344 --> 01:06:23,005
You fitted so well in the family.

948
01:06:24,146 --> 01:06:26,046
By the way where did
you learn Punjabi?

949
01:06:26,248 --> 01:06:28,614
My mothertongue
is Punjabi. - No way.

950
01:06:28,818 --> 01:06:31,309
Yashvardhan are Punjabis.

951
01:06:32,388 --> 01:06:33,855
I would not have guessed that.

952
01:06:36,258 --> 01:06:39,625
Dumpy is very cute.
He loves you a lot.

953
01:06:40,863 --> 01:06:43,957
You too. Thanks for
being so nice to him.

954
01:06:45,634 --> 01:06:47,363
It is I who has to thank.

955
01:06:48,871 --> 01:06:54,832
Only today I learnt what
relations are and what family is.

956
01:06:57,146 --> 01:07:00,877
I have laughed so much that
my eyes are filled with tears.

957
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:05,485
Your hotel has come.

958
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:28,365
Come on, what happened?

959
01:07:31,013 --> 01:07:35,211
Nothing! You know, Aditya...
what is the most beautiful moment...

960
01:07:35,484 --> 01:07:37,975
...in my day? - What is it?

961
01:07:41,223 --> 01:07:42,850
When I come to meet you.

962
01:07:47,430 --> 01:07:50,399
And do you know what the
worst moment in my day is?

963
01:07:52,802 --> 01:07:54,531
It is when I go away
after meeting you.

964
01:07:56,005 --> 01:07:59,406
But why do these moments
come together? I don't understand.

965
01:08:04,980 --> 01:08:08,814
I'll leave. Give me a ring. - What?

966
01:08:09,118 --> 01:08:10,779
Give me a ring. - Ring!?

967
01:08:12,721 --> 01:08:14,018
On phone! - Okay.

968
01:08:14,223 --> 01:08:16,282
Call me. - Take care!

969
01:08:16,959 --> 01:08:18,358
You take care too.

970
01:08:23,332 --> 01:08:25,391
I'll take care of my thoughts too.

971
01:08:30,139 --> 01:08:31,663
Hi, best of luck.

972
01:08:31,941 --> 01:08:33,670
Yes, I desperately need that.

973
01:08:33,976 --> 01:08:35,967
Where is Nawab? - Overthere.

974
01:08:40,316 --> 01:08:41,214
What happened to him?

975
01:08:41,417 --> 01:08:42,714
Nothing! I warned him
last night not to over eat.

976
01:08:42,918 --> 01:08:46,217
But he didn't listen to me.
Now he has loose motions.

977
01:08:46,422 --> 01:08:48,049
He is going to the
toilet repeatedly.

978
01:08:48,257 --> 01:08:49,485
I don't know what to do.

979
01:08:51,861 --> 01:08:52,828
What will happen now?

980
01:08:53,729 --> 01:08:55,424
Nothing. We lost the
race even before it started.

981
01:08:55,631 --> 01:08:57,292
I don't have a navigator.

982
01:09:03,739 --> 01:09:07,573
I'll go and tell those people
that I don't have a navigator...

983
01:09:08,711 --> 01:09:11,202
...and so I can't participate.

984
01:09:11,647 --> 01:09:14,411
1, 2, 3, 4,

985
01:09:14,617 --> 01:09:18,713
Aditya! - What happened?

986
01:09:19,155 --> 01:09:20,520
I can try.

987
01:09:21,257 --> 01:09:24,988
Can you clean the car?
- I can try.

988
01:09:27,029 --> 01:09:28,519
I think your luck is working.

989
01:12:04,887 --> 01:12:06,582
Are you okay? - Yeah!

990
01:12:18,334 --> 01:12:19,358
Nice parking.

991
01:12:21,103 --> 01:12:24,163
Sorry, I dozed off.
What will happen now?

992
01:12:24,540 --> 01:12:27,441
Nothing! Now we have to wait
till morning. What else?

993
01:12:28,577 --> 01:12:29,805
Till morning? - Yes.

994
01:12:30,212 --> 01:12:31,611
What will we do till morning?

995
01:12:33,515 --> 01:12:35,483
You sleep here and I here.

996
01:12:35,751 --> 01:12:37,378
Because these doors won't open now.

997
01:12:37,586 --> 01:12:39,110
We are covered with snow all over.

998
01:12:41,056 --> 01:12:44,150
We'll go to sleep.
What else? Good night.

999
01:12:52,267 --> 01:12:53,234
I can't sleep.

1000
01:12:57,072 --> 01:13:00,064
You know I used to have
the same problem in childhood.

1001
01:13:00,275 --> 01:13:02,573
I would not get to sleep.

1002
01:13:02,778 --> 01:13:06,441
Then my mother would say
that if you can't sleep...

1003
01:13:07,549 --> 01:13:10,814
...then you must think of
such a place where you want to go.

1004
01:13:11,653 --> 01:13:13,814
And close your eyes.

1005
01:13:14,723 --> 01:13:16,281
Gradually you'll get to sleep.

1006
01:13:17,126 --> 01:13:18,684
Yeah, believe me.
I am telling you the truth.

1007
01:13:19,995 --> 01:13:24,432
Some times I used to
think and go into space.

1008
01:13:24,967 --> 01:13:25,934
It is amazing.

1009
01:13:26,802 --> 01:13:28,064
Oh, that's not possible.

1010
01:13:28,270 --> 01:13:31,239
It is. I am telling you. It's a fact.

1011
01:13:32,441 --> 01:13:33,533
You don't believe me?

1012
01:13:35,644 --> 01:13:38,442
Okay, let us try once and see.

1013
01:13:39,281 --> 01:13:40,509
Close your eyes.

1014
01:13:40,716 --> 01:13:46,052
We'll... try... come on...

1015
01:13:46,255 --> 01:13:49,224
Stop looking here...
come on... come on...

1016
01:13:49,425 --> 01:13:50,221
Close your eyes.

1017
01:14:02,337 --> 01:14:03,702
Jia, where are you?

1018
01:14:08,977 --> 01:14:17,351
Rome, Spanish steps...
It's so beautiful.

1019
01:14:18,620 --> 01:14:19,552
Where are you?

1020
01:14:21,156 --> 01:14:30,030
In the heaven of Kashmir... Iovely.

1021
01:14:32,401 --> 01:14:35,199
I always wanted to see Kashmir.

1022
01:14:36,038 --> 01:14:42,341
Hold my hands and see
how tall the mountains are.

1023
01:14:43,345 --> 01:14:44,835
How does it feel from here?

1024
01:14:55,657 --> 01:14:56,646
What happened?

1025
01:14:58,427 --> 01:15:00,452
I am scared of heights.

1026
01:15:04,700 --> 01:15:11,264
See, Jia. Only after reaching heights
in life can we see new paths.

1027
01:15:12,474 --> 01:15:16,103
And by travelling on those
paths we can attain new goals.

1028
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:22,146
What about the relations
that we kept all along?

1029
01:15:24,553 --> 01:15:29,456
In life some relationships
exist which we know...

1030
01:15:29,858 --> 01:15:31,553
...but don't want to tell ourselves.

1031
01:15:32,194 --> 01:15:35,527
But the heart inside
understands everything.

1032
01:15:35,731 --> 01:15:37,130
It knows everything.

1033
01:15:37,332 --> 01:15:42,895
The heart shows dreams
which can never become true.

1034
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:47,939
The distance between dreams
and reality is the wink of an eye.

1035
01:15:48,410 --> 01:15:50,674
It is a dream when the eye
is closed and...

1036
01:15:50,879 --> 01:15:52,938
...reality when it is open.

1037
01:15:54,416 --> 01:15:55,747
It is not so easy, Aditya.

1038
01:15:55,951 --> 01:15:58,749
Why not? Come on, dare to dream.

1039
01:15:59,555 --> 01:16:02,820
I am scared that I'll get lost.

1040
01:16:03,025 --> 01:16:08,895
I'll see that you
won't get lost. Trust me.

1041
01:16:09,264 --> 01:16:10,231
Give me your hand.

1042
01:16:20,309 --> 01:16:26,873
Now close your eyes and see that
your dreams are waiting foryou.

1043
01:16:30,886 --> 01:16:40,852
UTV

1044
01:16:45,100 --> 01:16:53,474
"You fill my breath
and my heart beat."

1045
01:16:53,675 --> 01:17:06,145
"You fill my eyes and my life."

1046
01:17:06,488 --> 01:17:21,199
"You mesmerize me."

1047
01:17:21,403 --> 01:17:36,410
"You mesmerize me."

1048
01:18:01,910 --> 01:18:05,710
"The heart is filled with your pining...

1049
01:18:05,914 --> 01:18:09,941
...yourthoughts and thirst foryou."

1050
01:18:10,152 --> 01:18:18,992
"I am entirely yours. All my moments
are filled with yourthought."

1051
01:18:19,194 --> 01:18:26,100
"Such a bond is formed, my dear."

1052
01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:52,159
"You fill my body and this world."

1053
01:18:52,361 --> 01:19:04,899
"You fill my eyes and my life."

1054
01:19:05,107 --> 01:19:11,706
"You mesmerize me."

1055
01:19:13,649 --> 01:19:28,963
"You mesmerize me."

1056
01:19:30,599 --> 01:19:41,237
"You mesmerize me."

1057
01:20:09,138 --> 01:20:17,443
"The eyes are restless and intoxicated."

1058
01:20:17,646 --> 01:20:22,049
"How will these moments
of separation pass?"

1059
01:20:22,251 --> 01:20:28,019
What happened?
- Nothing! The paths are open.

1060
01:20:29,658 --> 01:20:33,685
Let's go. - Let's go.

1061
01:20:35,097 --> 01:20:44,631
"Such a bond has formed, my dear."

1062
01:20:52,915 --> 01:20:54,212
So? - So?

1063
01:20:55,184 --> 01:20:57,652
What now? - Nothing! I am hungry.

1064
01:20:58,654 --> 01:20:59,518
So am I.

1065
01:21:00,022 --> 01:21:02,217
There is a restaurant in front.
Let's go there.

1066
01:21:02,424 --> 01:21:04,688
Okay. Give me five minutes.
I'll Just freshen up.

1067
01:21:04,893 --> 01:21:14,131
Okay. I'll park the vehicle and come.

1068
01:21:14,536 --> 01:21:18,495
I'll meet you down
in five minutes. - Yeah!

1069
01:21:39,561 --> 01:21:41,392
You girls have strange ways!

1070
01:21:41,597 --> 01:21:43,656
You said five minutes
but took forty.

1071
01:21:43,866 --> 01:21:44,628
Actually I...

1072
01:21:44,833 --> 01:21:50,362
Who is there, honey?
- Karan... it is...

1073
01:21:57,145 --> 01:21:59,511
Yes? - Actually it is...
- Room service, sir.

1074
01:22:01,817 --> 01:22:03,478
Your hotel knows that
I'm not to be disturbed.

1075
01:22:03,685 --> 01:22:06,051
Actually I called him.

1076
01:22:08,023 --> 01:22:08,921
Your uniform?

1077
01:22:10,659 --> 01:22:14,459
Sir, it was the last call of the shift.
I already changed my clothes.

1078
01:22:14,663 --> 01:22:15,561
I am sorry about that, sir.

1079
01:22:15,764 --> 01:22:17,595
That's being very unprofessional.

1080
01:22:18,667 --> 01:22:20,259
You know I can get
you sacked forthat.

1081
01:22:20,602 --> 01:22:24,538
Sorry sir. - Anyway
clean the mess. - Sure.

1082
01:22:25,407 --> 01:22:27,466
It's ok. I think it can be done later.

1083
01:22:27,676 --> 01:22:29,405
That's his Job, honey. Let him do it.

1084
01:22:32,848 --> 01:22:36,306
Excuse me waiter. - Yes sir.

1085
01:22:42,124 --> 01:22:45,389
That's a tip foryou and
next time come in uniform. Ok?

1086
01:22:45,661 --> 01:22:46,787
I will be careful, sir.

1087
01:22:51,867 --> 01:22:57,635
Honey, I forgot to ask you.
How was your shopping? - Okay, not bad.

1088
01:23:12,888 --> 01:23:13,820
Welcome, Mr. Oberoi. - Hello.

1089
01:23:14,022 --> 01:23:14,545
How are you sir?

1090
01:23:14,756 --> 01:23:16,849
Always the best. You want a picture?

1091
01:23:17,426 --> 01:23:19,291
Gentlemen, he is the son of my friend.

1092
01:23:20,028 --> 01:23:21,859
He has grown up in front of me.

1093
01:23:23,465 --> 01:23:27,561
Afterthe unfortunate
death of Mr. And Mrs. Oberoi...

1094
01:23:28,103 --> 01:23:30,697
...the way he managed the business...

1095
01:23:31,373 --> 01:23:32,169
...it's amazing!

1096
01:23:32,374 --> 01:23:35,036
Mr. Oberoi, your marriage and this proJect...
won't there be a clash?

1097
01:23:35,344 --> 01:23:36,811
It's a merger it is not a clash.

1098
01:23:37,145 --> 01:23:38,942
You know each other
for quite some time...

1099
01:23:39,147 --> 01:23:40,705
...what do you like about Karan?

1100
01:23:40,916 --> 01:23:41,848
Jia, cut the list short.

1101
01:23:42,050 --> 01:23:44,416
Mr. Oberoi how do you classify
your marriage, love or arranged?

1102
01:23:44,620 --> 01:23:47,384
Of course love!
I love her and she loves me.

1103
01:23:50,459 --> 01:23:52,450
Karan, please!
- Why? What happened?

1104
01:23:52,894 --> 01:23:54,486
I don't like doing it forthe photos.

1105
01:23:54,696 --> 01:23:56,323
Look honey, I am Karan Oberoi.

1106
01:23:56,565 --> 01:23:58,863
Whatever I do, they're
bound to take pictures.

1107
01:23:59,067 --> 01:23:59,863
Sorry to interrupt you, sir.

1108
01:24:00,068 --> 01:24:02,298
But they are waiting for
you inside. - Ok, come.

1109
01:24:02,771 --> 01:24:06,036
Good evening sir. - Hello.
- Good evening.

1110
01:24:06,241 --> 01:24:07,469
Good evening. - Good evening.

1111
01:24:08,410 --> 01:24:10,810
Here he is. Welcome, my son.

1112
01:24:11,113 --> 01:24:14,674
Meet Mr. Wilson. Mr. Gupta.

1113
01:24:16,485 --> 01:24:19,420
Mr. Thapar. - Good evening,
Mr. Thapar. How are you?

1114
01:24:19,855 --> 01:24:20,879
And Mr. Mittal.

1115
01:24:21,089 --> 01:24:22,488
Congratulations, Mr. Oberoi.

1116
01:24:22,691 --> 01:24:25,558
You are getting married to Yashvardhan.
You've taken overthe steel industry.

1117
01:24:25,761 --> 01:24:28,252
You must be a happy man.
You have everything, man.

1118
01:24:28,764 --> 01:24:31,096
Everything... one takeover
is still left.

1119
01:24:31,299 --> 01:24:32,789
What? - Your company.

1120
01:24:33,001 --> 01:24:34,525
I am sorry. You must be Joking.

1121
01:24:34,736 --> 01:24:36,863
I'm serious. I'm serious.

1122
01:24:38,273 --> 01:24:40,639
C'mon let's go.
- I am very serious.

1123
01:24:46,548 --> 01:24:50,279
I am Just observing that
Karan is not marrying me.

1124
01:24:52,254 --> 01:24:53,619
He is Just doing a take-over.

1125
01:24:56,525 --> 01:25:00,484
It is betterthat you make it a habit.

1126
01:25:30,959 --> 01:25:31,618
Your Pizza, sir.

1127
01:25:31,827 --> 01:25:36,321
Aah... thank God you are here.
I am very hungry. - Me too.

1128
01:25:39,034 --> 01:25:40,524
EnJoy guys! - Thank you!

1129
01:25:42,871 --> 01:25:44,202
Won't you say anything?

1130
01:25:45,173 --> 01:25:47,004
I am thinking about what to say.

1131
01:25:49,911 --> 01:25:51,503
Won't you ask me to come in?

1132
01:25:51,913 --> 01:25:53,540
Sorry! Please come in.

1133
01:26:00,222 --> 01:26:02,190
Thank you. I like this
anger of yours.

1134
01:26:05,660 --> 01:26:06,490
Actually what happened
that day is...

1135
01:26:06,595 --> 01:26:07,459
That is past.

1136
01:26:12,033 --> 01:26:14,433
You are completely wet.
Why don't you go and change?

1137
01:26:15,270 --> 01:26:16,828
Okay. Thank you.

1138
01:26:22,744 --> 01:26:24,371
This is yours.

1139
01:26:29,484 --> 01:26:31,577
Why isn't everyone like you, Aditya?

1140
01:26:33,488 --> 01:26:37,356
You understand everything
without me saying anything.

1141
01:26:43,031 --> 01:26:44,464
Silence is also strange.

1142
01:26:46,401 --> 01:26:55,537
If it enters a relationship
then it turns into suffocation.

1143
01:26:56,144 --> 01:26:59,170
Coffee? - Thank you!

1144
01:27:09,624 --> 01:27:16,962
My father used to talk to
everyone except to my mother.

1145
01:27:21,002 --> 01:27:24,233
Dad had only a physical
relation with my mother.

1146
01:27:27,475 --> 01:27:32,606
He used to beat her and
she bore it all silently.

1147
01:27:38,053 --> 01:27:40,214
Mom used to love dad a lot.

1148
01:27:45,393 --> 01:27:49,056
People say that love can
change anyone.

1149
01:27:54,569 --> 01:27:55,866
But it couldn't change my dad.

1150
01:28:02,444 --> 01:28:07,108
Even today people think
that my mom committed suicide.

1151
01:28:11,152 --> 01:28:18,388
But I know that dad's
silence killed her.

1152
01:28:22,364 --> 01:28:27,927
My father killed her.
His indifference killed her.

1153
01:28:35,877 --> 01:28:37,401
The weather outside is very bad.

1154
01:28:38,947 --> 01:28:41,108
It is betterthat
you stay here tonight.

1155
01:28:44,286 --> 01:28:48,017
It is said that the sunlight
after a rain will be beautiful.

1156
01:28:49,958 --> 01:28:53,052
Do you like coffee cold? - No.

1157
01:28:53,361 --> 01:28:57,422
Then drink it hot. Cheers!

1158
01:29:07,676 --> 01:29:12,511
Who is it? - There is a
girl in the room upstairs.

1159
01:29:13,481 --> 01:29:15,142
Don't you think you must do something?

1160
01:29:16,484 --> 01:29:17,382
Nawab! She is very worried.

1161
01:29:17,585 --> 01:29:20,247
I know that. You can make
herforget her worries.

1162
01:29:20,455 --> 01:29:23,049
It cannot be done by sleeping here.
You have to go upstairs.

1163
01:29:23,658 --> 01:29:24,215
Shut up! Go and sleep, Nawab.

1164
01:29:24,426 --> 01:29:25,586
Please go upstairs, buddy.
Please go.

1165
01:29:25,794 --> 01:29:27,489
It is very late in the night, Nawab.

1166
01:29:29,698 --> 01:29:33,828
I am telling you.
Please think again.

1167
01:29:34,035 --> 01:29:35,559
I don't want to speak to you.

1168
01:29:36,271 --> 01:29:37,795
Oh, sorry.

1169
01:29:38,139 --> 01:29:39,231
No! No, Jia!
I didn't say that to you.

1170
01:29:40,675 --> 01:29:41,334
Out!

1171
01:29:42,143 --> 01:29:43,940
No! Not you.
I am telling that to Nawab.

1172
01:29:44,145 --> 01:29:45,737
There he goes behind you.

1173
01:29:49,317 --> 01:29:51,410
I couldn't sleep. That is why...

1174
01:29:52,220 --> 01:29:56,350
I too couldn't sleep.
That is why I am watching the movie.

1175
01:29:56,558 --> 01:29:57,525
Which movie is this?

1176
01:29:58,293 --> 01:29:59,760
Junglee!

1177
01:30:00,495 --> 01:30:02,827
Hey, Shammi Kapoor!
- He is my favourite.

1178
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:07,366
'That means you love someone.'

1179
01:30:07,969 --> 01:30:09,459
'Do you know when you love someone...

1180
01:30:09,671 --> 01:30:11,263
...the confusion in your
heart will increase.'

1181
01:30:11,806 --> 01:30:14,138
'You cannot understand my feelings.'

1182
01:30:16,544 --> 01:30:19,411
'I love you a lot!
I love you a lot.'

1183
01:30:20,148 --> 01:30:22,480
How easily they said
'I love you.'

1184
01:30:22,717 --> 01:30:23,479
Popcorn?

1185
01:30:23,718 --> 01:30:29,623
I wish it was so easy.
- I wish it was so easy.

1186
01:30:29,824 --> 01:30:33,658
"Alas! What should I do?"

1187
01:30:33,862 --> 01:30:38,697
I love this song. IJust love
the way he dances in this.

1188
01:30:38,900 --> 01:30:40,595
Shammi Kapoor man, he's God.

1189
01:30:42,537 --> 01:30:44,664
I wish I could dance like him.

1190
01:30:44,873 --> 01:30:47,569
Then we can try.
It shouldn't be difficult.

1191
01:30:48,243 --> 01:30:49,642
Come on, let's try. - No! No!

1192
01:30:49,844 --> 01:30:51,903
It will be fun.
It will be really fun. Come on!

1193
01:30:52,247 --> 01:30:54,010
Come on, get up.

1194
01:30:56,351 --> 01:31:09,492
"Alas! What should I do?"

1195
01:31:44,833 --> 01:31:48,428
The DVD got stuck. - Yes.

1196
01:31:48,636 --> 01:31:50,399
I will forward it.

1197
01:31:52,073 --> 01:31:54,906
It would have been nice
if we could forward life too.

1198
01:31:55,743 --> 01:31:57,904
Then the fun of living will go away.

1199
01:31:59,681 --> 01:32:04,118
But we can know which
relationships last life long...

1200
01:32:05,253 --> 01:32:07,050
...and which are short-lived.

1201
01:32:11,493 --> 01:32:13,723
Would you like to
spend your life with me?

1202
01:32:14,262 --> 01:32:24,968
"I will be thankful to you
if you let me tell you my feelings."

1203
01:32:25,173 --> 01:32:35,674
"I am in love with you...
let me take shelter in your eyes."

1204
01:32:35,884 --> 01:32:46,158
"I will be thankful to you
if you let me tell you my feelings."

1205
01:32:46,361 --> 01:32:56,760
"I am in love with you...
let me take shelter in your eyes."

1206
01:32:56,971 --> 01:33:02,603
"I will be thankful to you..."

1207
01:33:22,130 --> 01:33:30,663
It is morning.
Seems like you didn't sleep all night.

1208
01:33:32,273 --> 01:33:34,503
I was waiting foryour reply.

1209
01:33:39,180 --> 01:33:47,246
Let me think over it.
The wait is only till 6 pm tomorrow.

1210
01:33:47,889 --> 01:33:49,254
Same restaurant.

1211
01:33:50,124 --> 01:33:54,925
I can't come at 6... because
I'll reach there by 5.30

1212
01:34:02,870 --> 01:34:05,338
Hi... good morning.
- Hi... good morning

1213
01:34:05,573 --> 01:34:07,370
So early in the morning.
Where are you coming from?

1214
01:34:08,476 --> 01:34:09,101
A morning walk.

1215
01:34:09,310 --> 01:34:11,574
A morning walk or... who is it?

1216
01:34:11,813 --> 01:34:14,680
Who? - You know it.

1217
01:34:17,986 --> 01:34:20,716
C'mon Jia, out with it.

1218
01:34:21,489 --> 01:34:23,855
His name is Aditya... - And?

1219
01:34:25,560 --> 01:34:26,993
He too is from India.

1220
01:34:27,595 --> 01:34:34,433
We met by sheer coincidence
and that became my destiny.

1221
01:34:35,036 --> 01:34:36,196
I don't even know how
it all happened.

1222
01:34:36,404 --> 01:34:41,535
I can't... do you know
what you are saying, Jia?

1223
01:34:41,743 --> 01:34:45,873
I know Just one thing.
That he is the one for me.

1224
01:34:46,714 --> 01:34:50,707
He is so loving... he is so caring...
and he is so funny.

1225
01:34:51,252 --> 01:34:52,810
He is so friendly and caring.

1226
01:34:53,488 --> 01:34:56,924
And the most important thing
is that when he is with me...

1227
01:34:58,059 --> 01:35:01,790
...he is Just with me.
He makes me come alive.

1228
01:35:03,064 --> 01:35:07,558
I can see that.
But you are forgetting that...

1229
01:35:08,269 --> 01:35:12,968
...you are Jia Yashvardhan
and shall be Jia Oberoi.

1230
01:35:14,609 --> 01:35:17,407
These two names and their
status is much greater...

1231
01:35:18,313 --> 01:35:22,147
...than your life and
every happiness of yours.

1232
01:35:25,653 --> 01:35:29,589
I think that you don't
know about Karan Oberoi.

1233
01:35:29,791 --> 01:35:33,488
You rememberthat in
your engagement party...

1234
01:35:34,062 --> 01:35:36,758
...the editor of a national
newspaper got drunk...

1235
01:35:37,231 --> 01:35:41,099
...and misbehaved with you
in front of the entire press.

1236
01:35:41,669 --> 01:35:43,762
Yes, but I did forgive him.

1237
01:35:43,971 --> 01:35:48,465
What you don't know is that
Just a week later...

1238
01:35:49,210 --> 01:35:57,675
...that editor was killed in an
accident and all the offices...

1239
01:35:58,686 --> 01:36:00,313
...of that paper were gutted by fire.

1240
01:36:03,024 --> 01:36:06,755
Karan Oberoi neverforgives.

1241
01:36:09,263 --> 01:36:12,232
When he loves you... he owns you.

1242
01:36:12,433 --> 01:36:14,993
I don't care, Jenny.
IJust don't care.

1243
01:36:15,336 --> 01:36:18,794
All this mattered till
I didn't meet this one.

1244
01:36:19,240 --> 01:36:22,334
You don't know him.
He is Just like that.

1245
01:36:23,611 --> 01:36:26,580
Hi, sweetheart. Talking about me?

1246
01:36:27,014 --> 01:36:30,541
It means you are madly
in love Just like me.

1247
01:36:38,359 --> 01:36:42,159
Angry? I am sorry.

1248
01:36:43,297 --> 01:36:46,164
I know that I was very busy
with the delegates last night.

1249
01:36:46,968 --> 01:36:51,098
But what can I do? Everybody
wants a piece of Karan Oberoi...

1250
01:36:52,140 --> 01:36:53,767
...and I'm sure
I must have ignored you.

1251
01:36:54,308 --> 01:36:58,438
But I promise you. I swear on
anyone this will never happen again.

1252
01:37:01,048 --> 01:37:04,711
Now smile... smile...

1253
01:37:04,919 --> 01:37:07,251
Excuse me, sir. The press
are here forthe interview.

1254
01:37:07,455 --> 01:37:08,752
They are waiting downstairs.

1255
01:37:09,724 --> 01:37:12,625
Sorry Jia. Can't get on
the bad side of press.

1256
01:37:12,827 --> 01:37:14,852
I'll return soon.

1257
01:37:18,933 --> 01:37:20,264
Nice shopping, Jia.

1258
01:37:22,170 --> 01:37:24,502
Doesn't the size look a bit odd?

1259
01:37:25,940 --> 01:37:30,309
But it's not looking bad.
Actually very bad.

1260
01:37:30,912 --> 01:37:33,642
See only those dreams
that you are allowed to.

1261
01:37:34,348 --> 01:37:35,872
Oryou'll have hard times.

1262
01:37:42,156 --> 01:37:44,818
Herfather is responsible
for her mother's death.

1263
01:37:48,463 --> 01:37:50,556
She faced many troubles in her life.

1264
01:37:50,765 --> 01:37:51,754
Such a father should be
dragged on to streets...

1265
01:37:51,966 --> 01:37:53,593
Nawab, she is so lonely you know.

1266
01:37:54,035 --> 01:37:55,866
Lonely? Why will she be
when you are there?

1267
01:37:56,804 --> 01:38:00,205
I want to see her happy.
That's all.

1268
01:38:02,109 --> 01:38:05,272
I saw anotherJia inside her.

1269
01:38:06,314 --> 01:38:10,307
I am afraid that she may
face trouble because of me.

1270
01:38:11,652 --> 01:38:17,249
We shouldn't be afraid of
troubles. We should face them.

1271
01:38:17,992 --> 01:38:19,619
I am going for a Jog.

1272
01:38:22,396 --> 01:38:32,362
UTV

1273
01:39:13,714 --> 01:39:19,584
"You shouldn't have
entered my life."

1274
01:39:22,290 --> 01:39:28,195
"You shouldn't have
left me once you entered."

1275
01:39:30,898 --> 01:39:36,359
"You shouldn't have
entered my life."

1276
01:39:36,571 --> 01:39:41,474
"You shouldn't have
left me once you entered."

1277
01:39:41,676 --> 01:39:51,347
"You intoxicated me
and went away."

1278
01:39:51,552 --> 01:40:02,224
"You intoxicated me
and went away."

1279
01:40:08,035 --> 01:40:13,496
"You shouldn't have
hooked my heart."

1280
01:40:13,708 --> 01:40:18,805
"You shouldn't have
tempted me so much."

1281
01:40:18,980 --> 01:40:23,679
"What shall I now tell
my heart and pacify it."

1282
01:40:23,851 --> 01:40:28,117
"You made me crazy."

1283
01:40:28,856 --> 01:40:33,657
"What shall I now tell
my heart and pacify it."

1284
01:40:33,861 --> 01:40:38,355
"You made me crazy."

1285
01:40:39,467 --> 01:40:50,366
"You made me crazy."

1286
01:41:23,944 --> 01:41:29,849
"You made me laugh and
you made me cry."

1287
01:41:30,317 --> 01:41:35,254
"What have you done to me?"

1288
01:41:35,456 --> 01:41:41,486
"My feelings let me out."

1289
01:41:41,696 --> 01:41:47,066
"What have you done to me?"

1290
01:41:47,268 --> 01:41:51,830
"I was fine being alone."

1291
01:41:53,007 --> 01:41:59,003
"Why did that distance vanish?"

1292
01:41:59,580 --> 01:42:04,847
"You shouldn't have
locked eyes with mine."

1293
01:42:05,352 --> 01:42:10,085
"You shouldn't have smiled at me."

1294
01:42:10,291 --> 01:42:19,359
"You kept laughing
and captivated me."

1295
01:42:20,468 --> 01:42:30,400
"You kept laughing
and captivated me."

1296
01:42:31,078 --> 01:42:36,448
"You made me crazy."

1297
01:42:36,650 --> 01:42:42,486
"You made me crazy."

1298
01:43:09,884 --> 01:43:21,022
"What pining was or
what pain was I knew not."

1299
01:43:21,228 --> 01:43:26,996
"Why the heart pounds hard
and goes in a tizzy I knew not."

1300
01:43:27,201 --> 01:43:38,271
"I have lost my senses."

1301
01:43:38,913 --> 01:43:44,613
"The world seems as
if filled with intoxication."

1302
01:43:45,352 --> 01:43:50,949
"You shouldn't have
said a thing to me."

1303
01:43:51,158 --> 01:43:55,925
"You should have kept
the secret to yourself."

1304
01:43:56,130 --> 01:44:05,903
"With your meetings
you enthralled me."

1305
01:44:06,106 --> 01:44:15,242
"With your meetings
you enthralled me."

1306
01:44:16,917 --> 01:44:22,253
"You made me crazy."

1307
01:44:22,456 --> 01:44:28,053
"You made me crazy."

1308
01:44:28,262 --> 01:44:33,598
"You made me crazy."

1309
01:44:33,801 --> 01:44:39,603
"You made me crazy."

1310
01:44:39,874 --> 01:44:42,570
Hello, sir! - What's the time?
- 5.30.

1311
01:44:43,711 --> 01:44:44,575
Thank you.

1312
01:44:51,619 --> 01:44:52,813
Hi... sugar.

1313
01:44:54,889 --> 01:44:55,651
Karan... you? Here?

1314
01:44:55,856 --> 01:45:00,850
Shouldn't I be here?
- No, I mean... - Some wine?

1315
01:45:01,462 --> 01:45:02,360
Thanks!

1316
01:45:06,400 --> 01:45:08,197
I thought of giving you a surprise.

1317
01:45:10,738 --> 01:45:12,831
But you surprised me.

1318
01:45:14,508 --> 01:45:19,445
I don't know why, Jia.
The more I see you...

1319
01:45:21,582 --> 01:45:29,853
...the more I find you
beautiful... gorgeous, stunning...

1320
01:45:33,527 --> 01:45:36,291
There is some strange
intoxication in yourfragrance.

1321
01:45:39,433 --> 01:45:44,735
Why did you do this...
why did you do this to me?

1322
01:45:45,773 --> 01:45:50,107
Karan! What are you saying?
I don't understand.

1323
01:45:51,211 --> 01:45:53,008
You know who you are to me.

1324
01:45:57,551 --> 01:45:58,882
Ya... yourfiancé...

1325
01:45:59,920 --> 01:46:10,228
My fiancé. My fiancé,
yes you are going to be my wife.

1326
01:46:13,400 --> 01:46:15,493
My wife by practice
and not by law.

1327
01:46:16,303 --> 01:46:17,463
So you must have same
respect for me...

1328
01:46:17,671 --> 01:46:19,366
...which every wife should
have for her husband.

1329
01:46:20,140 --> 01:46:22,301
I have a right on your every
breath and thought.

1330
01:46:23,944 --> 01:46:27,209
Moreover I don't like
it piecemeal.

1331
01:46:27,982 --> 01:46:33,545
Is that clear... Good...
Excuse me...

1332
01:46:39,727 --> 01:46:40,386
Dad!

1333
01:46:41,362 --> 01:46:45,298
What is this? What is this...

1334
01:46:49,903 --> 01:46:54,272
What is this? You accused me
of killing your mother.

1335
01:46:54,608 --> 01:46:58,704
That too in front of some
stranger. They are trash!

1336
01:46:59,146 --> 01:47:03,640
See how they ruined our
prestige forthe sake of money.

1337
01:47:03,851 --> 01:47:06,411
Dad I was... - Enough is enough.

1338
01:47:10,257 --> 01:47:12,316
Jennifer, book us on
the next flight.

1339
01:47:13,594 --> 01:47:16,654
We are going back to
India right now.

1340
01:47:26,874 --> 01:47:31,243
Its okay. Its okay.

1341
01:48:02,810 --> 01:48:04,971
Excuse me, Jia Yashvardhan,
room no 1204.

1342
01:48:05,179 --> 01:48:05,873
Is she in her room?

1343
01:48:06,080 --> 01:48:08,014
No, sir. There is no one.
They left forthe airport.

1344
01:48:08,215 --> 01:48:09,773
Are you sure? - Yes, sir.

1345
01:48:50,557 --> 01:48:54,857
We have time.
Go and freshen up. Go!

1346
01:49:05,706 --> 01:49:08,937
Jia! What's happening, Jia?

1347
01:49:11,378 --> 01:49:12,777
Where are you going?

1348
01:49:14,481 --> 01:49:16,415
I am talking...
I am talking to you.

1349
01:49:16,617 --> 01:49:17,641
Where are you going?

1350
01:49:17,985 --> 01:49:19,009
Who the hell are you?

1351
01:49:20,154 --> 01:49:21,644
Who are you to me?

1352
01:49:22,055 --> 01:49:23,352
Why should I tell you?

1353
01:49:23,891 --> 01:49:26,359
So that you can cash
on my emotions again?

1354
01:49:27,161 --> 01:49:28,059
Cash!?

1355
01:49:28,328 --> 01:49:31,297
You should have told me
if you wanted money.

1356
01:49:31,765 --> 01:49:33,426
My father is a very rich man.

1357
01:49:33,634 --> 01:49:35,192
You would have got
more money than this.

1358
01:49:35,402 --> 01:49:36,699
What!? - Yes.

1359
01:49:37,671 --> 01:49:42,631
I told you the things that
I was afraid to say to myself.

1360
01:49:42,843 --> 01:49:49,305
Because I had faith in you.
More than I have on myself.

1361
01:49:50,017 --> 01:49:52,645
But you betrayed me...

1362
01:49:52,853 --> 01:49:54,718
Jia... what are you trying to say?

1363
01:49:56,523 --> 01:49:59,321
Read this... read it...

1364
01:49:59,593 --> 01:50:02,221
Are you okay? - Ya... fine...

1365
01:50:06,333 --> 01:50:11,066
I didn't get this written.
I didn't tell it. Believe me.

1366
01:50:11,271 --> 01:50:15,605
No... I will never
believe anyone from now.

1367
01:50:16,777 --> 01:50:20,941
I hate you. I hate the moments
I spent with you.

1368
01:50:22,282 --> 01:50:26,343
And I hate myself for
having a relationship with you.

1369
01:50:26,653 --> 01:50:30,487
Jia... Jia... Jia. No...
you cannot go leaving me...

1370
01:50:30,757 --> 01:50:34,352
Jia, I love you. Believe me.

1371
01:50:34,561 --> 01:50:37,587
Trust me I can't live
without you... trust me.

1372
01:50:41,468 --> 01:50:48,601
Don't ask anyone to trust
you in future. Don't ask.

It's okay. Getting late.
Come... come...

1389
01:52:20,067 --> 01:52:31,137
you will definitely come.

1390
01:52:31,845 --> 01:52:33,369
I was damn sure.

1391
01:52:37,684 --> 01:52:40,915
I had to come. I knew that
you will wait for me.

1392
01:52:42,089 --> 01:52:43,488
Why do you love me so much?

1393
01:52:44,958 --> 01:52:49,224
I told Simran not to tell you.
She spoilt my surprise.

1394
01:52:50,330 --> 01:52:54,061
Anyway I am so happy to see you.

1395
01:52:55,369 --> 01:52:57,837
Me too. I am very happy too.

1396
01:53:00,574 --> 01:53:01,734
You didn't tell us about your shows.

1397
01:53:01,942 --> 01:53:02,738
How did they go?

1398
01:53:02,943 --> 01:53:05,138
Fantastic! They were
so successful that...

1399
01:53:05,345 --> 01:53:07,336
...there was no end
to buyers' inquiries.

1400
01:53:07,547 --> 01:53:10,107
And guys, I'm soon going
to be a brand name.

1401
01:53:10,317 --> 01:53:12,842
Give me a five forthat!
- You are rocking Sonia!

1402
01:53:13,053 --> 01:53:14,680
Sonia, what it means is...

1403
01:53:14,888 --> 01:53:15,582
You have to move around
because of your profession...

1404
01:53:15,789 --> 01:53:17,882
...sometimes to Paris and
sometimes to London.

1405
01:53:18,558 --> 01:53:21,254
How will you both manage
after marriage?

1406
01:53:21,461 --> 01:53:23,952
We did it till now and
will do it in future too.

1407
01:53:25,365 --> 01:53:26,457
What do you say, Aditya?

1408
01:53:29,369 --> 01:53:31,234
See, he understands me.

1409
01:53:31,705 --> 01:53:35,106
He knows that only lucky people
get such opportunities.

1410
01:53:35,509 --> 01:53:38,444
And I don't want to lose
this opportunity at any cost.

1411
01:53:39,045 --> 01:53:41,343
You know I worked really hard forthis.

1412
01:53:43,483 --> 01:53:45,246
What is the need to wearthis?

1413
01:53:45,452 --> 01:53:47,113
Anyway you look like your mother.

1414
01:53:47,320 --> 01:53:51,188
Very funny! He looks so handsome!

1415
01:53:51,391 --> 01:53:52,722
Now I'll scare grandma.

1416
01:53:54,561 --> 01:53:58,463
Why are you silent and dull?
What happened, Adi?

1417
01:53:58,832 --> 01:53:59,764
Nothing.

1418
01:53:59,966 --> 01:54:02,958
I know... I know that Sonia came
to spend a little time.

1419
01:54:03,170 --> 01:54:08,005
But she came foryou only.
And we are not leaving her alone.

1420
01:54:08,775 --> 01:54:10,902
Sonia, you are free to go.

1421
01:54:18,218 --> 01:54:20,709
Did you miss me?

1422
01:54:21,688 --> 01:54:26,751
You might have remembered
me a little bit.

1423
01:54:28,395 --> 01:54:34,391
No? It is very good that
you didn't remember me.

1424
01:54:35,335 --> 01:54:37,428
But this time I missed you.

1425
01:54:39,573 --> 01:54:42,974
Initially I used to think
that you are my desire...

1426
01:54:43,310 --> 01:54:44,971
...and career is my necessity.

1427
01:54:45,645 --> 01:54:50,548
But being away from you I realised
now that you are my necessity.

1428
01:54:56,323 --> 01:54:58,484
Now I am afraid of this distance.

1429
01:55:02,596 --> 01:55:04,063
Shall I tell you something, Adi?

1430
01:55:05,265 --> 01:55:10,567
One knows how close the
other person to them is...

1431
01:55:11,471 --> 01:55:13,132
...only when they move
away from them.

1432
01:55:16,443 --> 01:55:21,813
I feel so complete with
you. I feel like flying.

1433
01:55:29,923 --> 01:55:32,016
I don't understand from
where I should start this.

1434
01:55:33,126 --> 01:55:34,150
Why? What happened?

1435
01:55:36,830 --> 01:55:44,327
Adi, I am the reason for
what happened between Jia and you.

1436
01:55:50,477 --> 01:55:52,570
I am responsible for all this mess...

1437
01:55:55,982 --> 01:55:59,850
You trusted me and told me
everything about Jia.

1438
01:56:02,789 --> 01:56:08,193
I told everything to my
friend in a drunken state.

1439
01:56:11,398 --> 01:56:13,389
Adi, I... I didn't mean it.

1440
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:17,731
I... Believe me, Adi!

1441
01:56:18,572 --> 01:56:21,166
I didn't know that there was also
a Journalist sitting there.

1442
01:56:23,076 --> 01:56:24,304
He printed all that.

1443
01:56:28,248 --> 01:56:32,275
I am... I'm not trying to
Justify myself, Adi.

1444
01:56:34,921 --> 01:56:37,219
I know that it doesn't make
any difference whether I was drunk...

1445
01:56:37,424 --> 01:56:38,948
...or a Journalist was
sitting at that place.

1446
01:56:42,429 --> 01:56:45,296
Actually, I have broken yourtrust.

1447
01:56:49,936 --> 01:56:54,236
I've taken away... I've taken
away your happiness from you.

1448
01:56:57,377 --> 01:57:00,574
It's okay. Come on,
it is getting late.

1449
01:57:00,780 --> 01:57:01,906
Let's go to work.

1450
01:57:02,916 --> 01:57:04,247
Please forgive me, Adi.

1451
01:57:04,451 --> 01:57:05,816
It's okay. C'mon, forget it.

1452
01:57:13,760 --> 01:57:20,791
"Where shall we go?"

1453
01:57:21,468 --> 01:57:26,462
"Where shall we go?"

1454
01:57:27,007 --> 01:57:33,970

1456

"These pangs of separation.
These separate paths."

1457
01:57:58,705 --> 01:58:03,665

you slowly, my beloved."

your image off from within...

...and cast aside the heartless one."

1466
01:59:53,119 --> 01:59:55,781
"It has deceived me."

1467
01:59:56,055 --> 01:59:58,455

your image off from within."

"Now I'll slowly bearthose memories...

1471
02:00:17,777 --> 02:00:25,980
...and the lights of hope
that have been put off."

1472
02:00:26,119 --> 02:00:32,217
"I will cast off
your memories slowly."

1473
02:00:42,402 --> 02:00:43,664
Yes, I am quite alright.

1474
02:00:43,870 --> 02:00:45,337
But your voice doesn't
sound like you are alright.

1475
02:00:45,538 --> 02:00:47,335
I am perfectly alright.

1476
02:00:47,540 --> 02:00:48,507
Adi! When are you coming back?

1477
02:00:48,708 --> 02:00:50,767
Should I talk? - It is Just a matter
of few days. I will be back.

1478
02:00:50,977 --> 02:00:52,171
Adi, are you alright?

1479
02:00:52,445 --> 02:00:53,503
Nothing happened to me.
I am alright.

1480
02:00:53,713 --> 02:00:55,681
Okay, I have to go now.
I will call you later.

1481
02:01:00,220 --> 02:01:04,623
"You made me crazy."

1482
02:01:05,692 --> 02:01:09,856
"You made me crazy."

1483
02:01:13,833 --> 02:01:19,829
"You left me alone with
a bevy of memories."

1484
02:01:24,777 --> 02:01:30,374
"You broke the traditions
of love and oaths of desire."

02:01:30,984 --> 02:01:35,978
"The moments of pain don't pass."

1486
02:01:36,389 --> 02:01:40,951
"The throb of love doesn't
leave the heart."

1487
02:01:41,661 --> 02:01:47,395
"You left me alone with
a bevy of memories."

1488
02:01:52,672 --> 02:01:58,235
"Wherever I go I find you."

1489
02:01:58,811 --> 02:02:03,976
"My steps will stop gradually."

1490
02:02:04,317 --> 02:02:09,380
"Your memories will fade gradually."

1491
02:02:10,023 --> 02:02:15,086
"This broken heart is proud
of the feeling called faith."

1492
02:02:15,561 --> 02:02:20,658
"This broken heart is proud
of the feeling called faith."

1493
02:02:21,100 --> 02:02:26,333
"That all the false dreams
will crumble slowly."

1494
02:02:26,706 --> 02:02:31,939
"That all the false dreams
will crumble slowly."

1495
02:02:32,278 --> 02:02:37,511
"Will make me forget you
slowly, my beloved."

"The wounds of love will heal slowly."

1497
02:02:44,857 --> 02:02:48,623
You remembered your mother so soon!
- I missed you so much, Ma.

1498
02:02:48,861 --> 02:02:50,795
You wouldn't have come if it were
not for Aditya's marriage.

1499
02:02:50,997 --> 02:02:51,964
Ask him. He never brings me here.

1500
02:02:52,165 --> 02:02:53,792
I got tired asking him
time and again.

1501
02:02:54,600 --> 02:02:57,467
Mom! Whenever I apply for
a visa they reJect it...

1502
02:02:57,670 --> 02:02:59,797
...saying that her photo doesn't match.

1503
02:03:00,006 --> 02:03:01,337
Very funny!

1504
02:03:01,607 --> 02:03:03,802
I mean how beautiful
she became due to my love.

1505
02:03:06,012 --> 02:03:07,980
And who is this? - I am Sharif.

1506
02:03:08,181 --> 02:03:09,648
That can be seen from yourface.

1507
02:03:10,049 --> 02:03:12,210
That's okay. But who are you?

1508
02:03:12,418 --> 02:03:14,818
Madam, I am Nawab Sharif,
a friend of Aditya.

1509
02:03:15,021 --> 02:03:16,079
I came here forthe marriage.

1510
02:03:16,289 --> 02:03:19,554
The marriage procession has come
but where is the groom?

1511
02:03:20,226 --> 02:03:21,386
I am here, Bebe!

1512
02:03:22,195 --> 02:03:27,656
My son, why are you standing
so far off? Come here.

1513
02:03:28,034 --> 02:03:30,093
Come and embrace your Bebe.

1514
02:03:30,536 --> 02:03:31,161
Yes, I will.

1515
02:03:34,374 --> 02:03:36,672
My heart is contented!

1516
02:03:43,383 --> 02:03:45,317
Why are my son's eyes wet?

1517
02:03:46,085 --> 02:03:51,489
IJust remembered mother. - Oh!

1518
02:04:02,969 --> 02:04:07,531
What are you doing, Adi?
Why don't you understand?

1519
02:04:10,977 --> 02:04:15,038
This path gives you only
trouble and nothing else.

1520
02:04:15,415 --> 02:04:21,718
I know that I am wrong.
But I can't help it.

1521
02:04:21,988 --> 02:04:27,119
Man may be wrong.
But God is never wrong.

1522
02:04:29,395 --> 02:04:31,886
He pairs people with a plan.

1523
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:37,800
And his decisions are our destiny.

1524
02:04:38,104 --> 02:04:44,566
Then what is love...
what is love?

1525
02:04:44,777 --> 02:04:45,675
Love is...

1526
02:04:48,448 --> 02:04:52,885
Nothing will come of your love
but listen to one thing carefully.

1527
02:04:53,953 --> 02:04:59,823
If tears flow from your eyes then
our happiness too will be lost.

1528
02:05:04,897 --> 02:05:06,262
Now see this! - You, here?

1529
02:05:06,466 --> 02:05:10,300
She ate my ears!

1530
02:05:10,803 --> 02:05:13,897
Call from your Sonia.

1531
02:05:15,141 --> 02:05:15,766
Hi, Sonia!

But there is no reaction from you.

1535

Are you angry that
I didn't come to the airport?

1536
02:05:28,287 --> 02:05:29,447
No, Sonia. That is not the matter.

Karan, can I ask you
something? - Yes.

1599
02:09:01,467 --> 02:09:03,401
What is it that will keep
our relationship alive...

1600
02:09:04,403 --> 02:09:06,303

Okay, buddy! Sorry... sorry...

1654
02:16:54,106 --> 02:16:54,663
It's okay.

1655
02:16:54,873 --> 02:16:57,808
It's not okay, madam... it's not okay.

1656
02:16:58,010 --> 02:16:59,307
No, no, it's really fine. Okay.

1657
02:16:59,511 --> 02:17:01,138
No! No, madam. One shouldn't
bump into others like this.

1658
02:17:01,613 --> 02:17:03,672
Listen to me. A man shouldn't
bump into others like this.

1659
02:17:03,882 --> 02:17:05,474
First he bumps and then they
introduce each to the other.

1660
02:17:05,684 --> 02:17:06,844
Afterthat both of
them fall in love.

1661
02:17:07,920 --> 02:17:11,481
Same this happened
to Aditya. My friend Aditya.

1662
02:17:11,690 --> 02:17:13,487
Aditya... Jia all messed up.

1663
02:17:13,692 --> 02:17:14,522
Who's Aditya?

1664
02:17:15,627 --> 02:17:18,118
That one standing alone.
I feel sorry for him.

1665
02:17:18,730 --> 02:17:19,822
Yes, I know everything about Aditya.

1666
02:17:20,032 --> 02:17:21,829
No! No, you don't know anything.

1667
02:17:22,034 --> 02:17:24,332
How can you know that?
I'll tell you.

1668
02:17:25,804 --> 02:17:27,738
Although it's too late.
But I'll tell you.

1669
02:17:29,408 --> 02:17:32,969
I was drunk and told
everything to my friends.

1670
02:17:43,622 --> 02:17:45,146
You fell in love.

1671
02:17:46,625 --> 02:17:48,991
But your mistake is
you loved him so much that...

1672
02:17:51,129 --> 02:17:55,828
...a small misunderstanding
appeared like a betrayal.

1673
02:17:57,836 --> 02:17:59,497
Why to talk about that, Jenny?

1674
02:18:02,074 --> 02:18:03,302
I am married now.

1675
02:18:04,977 --> 02:18:07,775
No, Jia... Jia... Jia...

1676
02:18:07,980 --> 02:18:10,380
We love only once in our life.

1677
02:18:11,450 --> 02:18:18,788
Second time it is Just adJustment.
Just adJustment.

1678
02:18:21,226 --> 02:18:29,634
I feel really bad foryou and
really bad for Aditya. Really bad.

1679
02:19:21,820 --> 02:19:22,445
Aditya...

1680
02:19:29,861 --> 02:19:31,385
Jia, you shouldn't come here.

1681
02:19:31,596 --> 02:19:35,794
If I didn't come at now...
I would never be able to forgive myself.

1682
02:19:36,201 --> 02:19:38,669
Bygones are bygones.
Forget them.

1683
02:19:41,173 --> 02:19:43,073
IJust want to see you happy.

1684
02:19:45,744 --> 02:19:49,236
I will try if you want it.

1685
02:19:50,015 --> 02:19:53,212
Good... I must go now.

1686
02:19:54,753 --> 02:19:57,153
If we meet again
someday in our life...

1687
02:19:57,356 --> 02:19:59,916
No. No, that will not happen.
That will not happen...

1688
02:20:00,359 --> 02:20:04,386
I told myself that the time
I spent with you...

1689
02:20:05,097 --> 02:20:07,031
...are the best moments of my life.

1690
02:20:09,468 --> 02:20:10,662
I will keep the memories of those
moments carefully in my heart.

1691
02:20:10,869 --> 02:20:12,336
They are going to be with me... Okay...

1692
02:20:14,639 --> 02:20:19,576
Listen! Will you give me one chance?

1693
02:20:21,380 --> 02:20:34,885
So that I can Just feel those moments
of closeness again? Jia Oberoi

1694
02:20:36,628 --> 02:20:39,563
Aditya Malhotra...

1695
02:20:43,368 --> 02:20:45,131
I will always rememberyou.

1696
02:20:48,040 --> 02:20:49,632
I will always rememberyou.

1697
02:20:51,676 --> 02:20:53,610
Will you always stay with me?

1698
02:20:56,615 --> 02:20:58,549
I will always keep you with me.

1699
02:21:00,185 --> 02:21:04,485
But will you come occasionally
to carry my shopping bags?

1700
02:21:07,392 --> 02:21:08,859
You have good sense of humour.

1701
02:21:12,431 --> 02:21:16,265
Your smile is very bad. - I know.

1702
02:22:39,918 --> 02:22:49,953
So, he is Aditya,
whom you gave your heart too.

1703
02:22:50,662 --> 02:22:51,390
No.

1704
02:22:57,736 --> 02:22:58,794
You love him.

1705
02:23:00,438 --> 02:23:02,406
There are many
faces of love, Karan.

1706
02:23:03,975 --> 02:23:06,102
But now you are everything to me.

1707
02:23:09,848 --> 02:23:17,311
But, I saw for myself...
I saw you hugging him.

1708
02:23:20,492 --> 02:23:23,359
That was a weak moment in my life.

1709
02:23:24,396 --> 02:23:29,595
But believe me,
I am yours and only yours.

1710
02:23:30,969 --> 02:23:35,838
I see... I see...

1711
02:23:37,609 --> 02:23:42,808
Can you look at me Just once...

1712
02:23:47,586 --> 02:23:48,917
...the way you look at him?

1713
02:23:50,222 --> 02:23:51,587
Can you?

1714
02:24:14,379 --> 02:24:15,710
Karan Oberoi!

1715
02:24:31,596 --> 02:24:33,757
You don't know
who Karan Oberoi is...

1716
02:24:35,267 --> 02:24:36,825
You are lucky...
you are still alive...

1717
02:24:38,670 --> 02:24:39,898
Jia is innocent.

1718
02:24:40,105 --> 02:24:49,707
Who are you to say that?
Because of you...

1719
02:24:52,083 --> 02:24:54,813
Just because of you she isn't
mine even after becoming mine.

1720
02:24:56,755 --> 02:25:05,629
I want to kill you... but how can
I remove you from her heart?

1721
02:25:05,830 --> 02:25:08,993
First you remove this doubt from
your heart, Mr. Oberoi.

1722
02:25:10,935 --> 02:25:17,738
Get lost... Just go away...
before I... Just get lost!

1723
02:25:34,125 --> 02:25:38,118
Why did you do this? Why?

1724
02:25:39,030 --> 02:25:40,361
It was not in my control.

1725
02:25:42,634 --> 02:25:46,730
It Just happened.
And continued to happen.

1726
02:26:04,956 --> 02:26:08,858
Why me... why with me, God?

1727
02:26:20,038 --> 02:26:21,198
I'll bring the taxi.

1728
02:26:47,499 --> 02:26:48,158
Jia...

1729
02:26:49,768 --> 02:26:50,860
Jia... are you alright, Jia?

1730
02:26:51,369 --> 02:26:54,338
Just hold on.

1731
02:26:59,244 --> 02:27:03,340
Jia. Just give me a hand.

1732
02:27:03,715 --> 02:27:04,511
Leave me.

1733
02:27:04,716 --> 02:27:07,207
Jia, Just give me hand.
- Leave me I say.

1734
02:27:08,219 --> 02:27:10,551
The petrol is coming out.
It may catch fire at any moment.

1735
02:27:10,755 --> 02:27:11,414
Don't be stupid.

1736
02:27:11,623 --> 02:27:13,591
I said get out. Leave me.

1737
02:27:15,727 --> 02:27:18,195
Fine, Jia. What if you
want to be here? Fine...

1738
02:27:19,264 --> 02:27:23,223
I am also going to be here...
this damn car may go on fire... Fine!

1739
02:27:27,972 --> 02:27:32,204
Why did you come here, Aditya?
Why did you come here?

1740
02:27:33,244 --> 02:27:37,840
Trust me. - Just go away.
- Come on.

1741
02:27:39,951 --> 02:27:44,615
Let me get you out from here.
- Just go away.

1742
02:27:58,736 --> 02:28:02,672
Should I say something?
You don't know how to do it.

1743
02:28:05,810 --> 02:28:08,108
What will I do by staying alive?

1744
02:28:09,247 --> 02:28:14,617
You need to be alive
if I have to be alive.

1745
02:28:25,463 --> 02:28:26,361
It's Aditya...

1746
02:28:26,731 --> 02:28:31,168
Adi, go from here... go... Adi...

1747
02:28:33,304 --> 02:28:33,895
Leave me...

1748
02:29:09,641 --> 02:29:14,044
Its okay. Just calm down.
Calm down.

1749
02:29:29,994 --> 02:29:30,961
YourJia.

1750
02:29:32,497 --> 02:29:35,625
Once an Indian woman
is married to someone...

1751
02:29:37,235 --> 02:29:39,066
...she dedicates her life to him.

1752
02:29:40,572 --> 02:29:44,770
She can never break that
relationship and that's a fact.

1753
02:30:16,574 --> 02:30:17,302
Aditya...

1754
02:30:40,932 --> 02:30:49,237
Jia may not break this
relationship but Karan Oberoi can.

1755
02:30:52,110 --> 02:30:53,668
Today I understood one thing.

1756
02:30:56,180 --> 02:31:01,743
Relation must be the bonding of hearts.

1757
02:31:03,254 --> 02:31:08,055
If there isn't any bonding
then relation suffocates the person.

1758
02:31:10,461 --> 02:31:12,429
There will be no place for love there.

1759
02:31:14,866 --> 02:31:17,960
Anyway I don't like anything piecemeal.

1760
02:31:18,169 --> 02:31:20,399
I want everything completely my own.

1761
02:31:24,208 --> 02:31:29,339
Come, Jia. You are free
from every relation today.

1762
02:31:30,615 --> 02:31:40,456
Come, you are free.
Come with me please, Jia... come.

1763
02:31:58,609 --> 02:32:00,804
Karan, what did you do?

1764
02:32:02,146 --> 02:32:05,707
I broke a relation
so that a bond becomes stronger.

1765
02:32:05,917 --> 02:32:07,111
But how can you...

1766
02:32:07,318 --> 02:32:08,615
How long, uncle?

1767
02:32:09,320 --> 02:32:13,222
How long should we sacrifice
lives in the name of tradition?

1768
02:32:15,193 --> 02:32:16,751
Relationships are
needed for life...

1769
02:32:17,829 --> 02:32:19,262
...but life shouldn't
depend on them.

1770
02:32:32,176 --> 02:32:33,837
My choice was correct.

1771
02:32:34,946 --> 02:32:36,504
But they are made
for each other.

1772
02:32:37,915 --> 02:32:41,908
No, Mr. Oberoi!
They are meant for each other.
