Pick it up...
They said it is urgent.

No calls during working hours.

00:06:05,353 --> 00:06:06,251

This is his stop.

My sister.

18
00:11:16,263 --> 00:11:17,753
Stop!
He needs to get off here.

19
00:11:25,439 --> 00:11:26,770
Good that I checked...

20
00:11:27,074 --> 00:11:28,769
Else, you'd have reached Ooty!

21
00:11:28,809 --> 00:11:30,777
They have been calling from the church.

[Chants continue]

27
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:00,061

00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,431
Yoshe, how is the rail town coming up?

29
00:13:36,103 --> 00:13:37,331
Will you finish it any soon?

30
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:50,773
Dad...

31
00:13:54,722 --> 00:13:56,121
Looks good!

32
00:13:59,126 --> 00:14:01,754
You both cannot be playing all the time.

33
00:14:04,531 --> 00:14:06,123
When Mamma needs rest,

34
00:14:06,767 --> 00:14:08,564
you will have to do all this.

35
00:14:10,604 --> 00:14:12,629
Mestry!
Where's the plug spanner?

36
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:13,502
It's in the box.

00:14:13,574 --> 00:14:14,302
Here...

38
00:14:15,342 --> 00:14:16,673
You've started picking up things.

39
00:14:17,077 --> 00:14:17,668
Babu, here.

40
00:14:19,179 --> 00:14:21,272
Why aren't you ready yet?

41
00:14:21,348 --> 00:14:23,009
The doctor's appointment is at 4.

42
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:24,414
Lilly, I can't come
with so much work pending.

43
00:14:24,518 --> 00:14:26,008
Need to deliver this jeep now.

44
00:14:26,086 --> 00:14:26,745
Let's do one thing.

45
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:30,421

Mamma to the hospital

46
00:14:31,058 --> 00:14:31,752
- Come.

47
00:14:32,092 --> 00:14:33,081
Take that Maruthi.

00:14:33,193 --> 00:14:34,091
It's owner will come only tomorrow.

49
00:14:34,661 --> 00:14:35,423
Doctor!

50
00:14:35,796 --> 00:14:36,490
How're you?

51
00:14:36,597 --> 00:14:37,621
Not bad.

52
00:14:38,565 --> 00:14:39,463
And, this is?

53
00:14:39,566 --> 00:14:41,124
My son Joshua.

54
00:14:42,302 --> 00:14:43,792
- Happy Christmas!
- Happy Christmas!

55
00:14:47,775 --> 00:14:49,106
- Coach!
- Hey...

56
00:14:50,644 --> 00:14:51,702
Sir, right there.

57
00:14:53,514 --> 00:14:55,038
So... Happy Christmas Sir!

58
00:14:55,149 --> 00:14:56,446
Happy Christmas to you too!

59
00:14:56,683 --> 00:14:58,651
- Sir, are you heading home?
- No.

60
00:14:58,719 --> 00:15:00,084
I'm going to travel a bit.

61
00:15:00,187 --> 00:15:02,212
Not going home for Christmas?

62
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:05,083
There really isn't anyone at home.

63
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:08,694
Sir, would you like to
come to my place for Christmas?

64
00:15:09,997 --> 00:15:10,986
Thank you Josh!

65
00:15:11,064 --> 00:15:13,760
You have a good Christmas,
and practice your football.

66
00:15:14,101 --> 00:15:14,590
Okay.

67
00:15:20,307 --> 00:15:24,368
Mary's boy child, Jesus Christ,

68
00:15:24,445 --> 00:15:28,142
was born on Christmas day!

69
00:15:28,215 --> 00:15:32,413
Dear believers, here to
celebrate the birth of the son of god...

70
00:15:32,586 --> 00:15:34,315
Two thousand years ago,

71
00:15:34,455 --> 00:15:38,118
in the stable in Jerusalem
where Baby Jesus was born,

72
00:15:38,158 --> 00:15:41,389
all living beings were
in anticipation of the divine...

73
00:15:41,695 --> 00:15:46,325
On a night when stars stood guard,
there was silence all around...

74
00:15:46,467 --> 00:15:47,627
(Lilly moans)

75
00:15:47,801 --> 00:15:48,495
Lilly!

76
00:15:56,643 --> 00:15:58,543
Aloshy!
It's a girl!

77
00:15:58,779 --> 00:16:00,212
- Normal delivery!
- Is it?

78
00:16:00,347 --> 00:16:01,041
Son!

79
00:16:01,148 --> 00:16:02,672
- You have company now.
- Congratulations!

80
00:16:04,051 --> 00:16:05,143
Yoshe!

81
00:16:06,153 --> 00:16:07,415
You have a sister!

82
00:16:19,433 --> 00:16:20,593
Who is this?

83
00:16:23,203 --> 00:16:24,135
Jenny

84
00:16:26,306 --> 00:16:27,170
Jenny

85
00:16:39,086 --> 00:16:39,677
Jenny

86
00:16:55,035 --> 00:17:00,132
Fireﬂy... rock-a-b ye!

87
00:17:00,374 --> 00:17:05,175
Twinkling bright in my eye...

88
00:17:06,113 --> 00:17:10,550
By your side all the while

89
00:17:11,552 --> 00:17:14,521
Ready to play our little games

90
00:17:14,688 --> 00:17:18,021
He has set up her
nursery in his room!

91
00:17:18,158 --> 00:17:22,356
- High in the sky awaits the moon
- Yoshe! Looks great.

92
00:17:22,763 --> 00:17:28,292
High in the sky awaits the moon

93
00:17:28,368 --> 00:17:33,067
Fireﬂy ro ck-a-b ye!

94
00:17:34,107 --> 00:17:39,477
Twinkling bright in my eye...

95
00:17:39,546 --> 00:17:44,142
By your side all the while

96
00:17:45,252 --> 00:17:49,450
Ready to play our little games

97
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:51,351
Sir, I have a sister now!

98
00:17:51,425 --> 00:17:52,722
- You?
- Yes.

99
00:17:52,793 --> 00:17:54,454
- Congratulations
- Thank you!

100
00:17:59,299 --> 00:18:03,201
The name of this child
is Jennifer Maria Thomas.

101
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:11,600
In the name of the father, son & the
holy spirit, I baptize this child.

102
00:18:18,619 --> 00:18:21,349
Like a little dragonﬂy

103
00:18:21,421 --> 00:18:24,015
Like a bird that wants to ﬂy

104
00:18:24,224 --> 00:18:29,685
[hold you close to me.
Far beyond what you can see

105
00:18:29,763 --> 00:18:35,292
Ifl were to ﬂy endlessly

106
00:18:35,369 --> 00:18:41,035
Won't you come follow me

107
00:18:41,141 --> 00:18:46,477
Let's gather little seeds on hillsides

108
00:18:46,546 --> 00:18:52,246
With little hands
let's make a play house

109
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:57,655
Like a loving beam ofmoonshine

110
00:18:57,758 --> 00:19:03,560
That shall follow you forever

111
00:19:04,698 --> 00:19:09,032
Fireﬂy ro ck-a-b ye!

112
00:19:10,303 --> 00:19:15,366
- Bro!
- Twinkling bright in my eye...

113
00:19:16,043 --> 00:19:20,309
By your side all the while

114
00:19:21,448 --> 00:19:27,284
Ready to play our little games

115
00:19:35,128 --> 00:19:37,562
- Baby! Baby...
- Jenny! Jenny!

116
00:19:37,631 --> 00:19:39,326
- Baby wake up...
- Mamma, what happened?

117
00:19:52,479 --> 00:19:53,605
Mr. & Mrs. Thomas...

118
00:19:53,714 --> 00:19:56,478
...your daughter has
a congenital condition.

119
00:19:57,050 --> 00:20:01,783
Organs of such children
may not function normally.

120
00:20:02,522 --> 00:20:07,357
For her to lead a normal life all you
can give is the best medical support.

121
00:20:07,594 --> 00:20:12,395
We'll do... whatever is necessary.
She'll be fine right?

122
00:20:13,266 --> 00:20:14,756
Pardon me for being frank...

123
00:20:15,736 --> 00:20:19,263
Such children may
not survive for too long.

124
00:20:38,258 --> 00:20:39,418
The rains messed up the rites.

125
00:20:39,459 --> 00:20:41,757
Have some tea, you are drenched.

126
00:20:45,332 --> 00:20:46,196
Come.

127
00:20:48,769 --> 00:20:51,636
Father, how long has it
been since Joshua last came?

128
00:21:01,448 --> 00:21:04,042
- Where do I keep these?
- Keep it in Jenny's room.

129
00:21:42,622 --> 00:21:43,520
What is it?

130
00:22:04,244 --> 00:22:06,439
Hey! Come here!

131
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:09,512
Come on!
Have this.

132
00:22:28,602 --> 00:22:30,399
That's Jenny's bell.

133
00:22:31,137 --> 00:22:32,661
For any emergency.

134
00:22:45,485 --> 00:22:49,819
In this room... she wrote,
drew, and dreamt of flying,

135
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:53,384
until she couldn't anymore.

136
00:23:41,541 --> 00:23:42,633
Lilly, will you please shut up?

137
00:23:42,709 --> 00:23:43,641
Why should I?

138
00:23:44,044 --> 00:23:45,511
Why aren't you getting what I am saying?

139
00:23:45,578 --> 00:23:48,138
What should I understand?
Explain!

140
00:23:48,548 --> 00:23:50,641
I want to take her to Velankanni church.

141
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:52,684
Is this the time to go on a pilgrimage?

142
00:23:52,752 --> 00:23:54,811
With that money we can
buy her medicines for two months.

143
00:23:55,088 --> 00:23:56,612
Only then will she get cured.

144
00:23:56,690 --> 00:23:59,284
Where is the money for all that?

145
00:23:59,459 --> 00:24:03,156
Here take it.
Sell it.

146
00:24:03,229 --> 00:24:06,198
We'll have to sell, not just these
but everything we have!

147
00:24:18,745 --> 00:24:20,212
Elsa, you can leave.

148
00:24:24,751 --> 00:24:26,275
Two-thousand five hundred right?

149
00:24:26,553 --> 00:24:28,487
No two-thousand nine hundred & six.

150
00:24:33,226 --> 00:24:34,250
The prices have gone up?

151
00:24:34,327 --> 00:24:35,294
Yes sir, a bit.

152
00:24:35,362 --> 00:24:36,021
Sir, bill.

153
00:24:39,599 --> 00:24:40,793
Come on boys fast fast fast.

154
00:24:56,616 --> 00:24:59,642
Kids learn from their parents...

155
00:25:00,053 --> 00:25:03,716
When we ask to meet the parents,
it is for a reason.

156
00:25:04,591 --> 00:25:06,252
Have you given your
teachers the sweets?

157
00:25:06,326 --> 00:25:08,453
- Pappa, this is my history teacher.
- Hello!

158
00:25:08,528 --> 00:25:10,519
- This is my geography teacher.
- Hello!

159
00:25:10,597 --> 00:25:12,121
- Congratulations.
- Thank you ma'am

160
00:25:12,532 --> 00:25:13,123
Thank you.

161
00:25:13,233 --> 00:25:15,224
Ma'am, have you seen Ms. Tessy?

162
00:25:16,069 --> 00:25:18,264
What will happen to you now?

163
00:25:18,605 --> 00:25:21,096
You will end up some mechanic like
your father!

164
00:25:21,241 --> 00:25:22,731
- What happened?
- What else?

165
00:25:23,176 --> 00:25:24,234
Failed miserably!

166
00:25:24,444 --> 00:25:25,775
They wont take him back.

167
00:25:26,179 --> 00:25:27,771
I don't know anymore.
Do whatever you please.

168
00:25:32,452 --> 00:25:33,282
Yoshe!

169
00:25:35,722 --> 00:25:36,381
Come...

170
00:25:41,227 --> 00:25:42,353
Sorry Dad.

171
00:25:42,629 --> 00:25:44,096
Don't worry...

172
00:25:45,131 --> 00:25:48,032
In an exam, sometimes one fails,
sometimes one passes.

173
00:25:49,369 --> 00:25:53,396
Let it go. I had promised
to take you to a special place...

174
00:25:53,807 --> 00:25:54,637
There...

175
00:25:57,043 --> 00:25:58,032
Go take a look.

176
00:27:17,023 --> 00:27:17,990
Joshua! Come.

177
00:27:18,057 --> 00:27:19,024
Brother!

178
00:27:20,326 --> 00:27:21,384
Darius!

179
00:27:22,095 --> 00:27:22,720
Come...

180
00:27:23,696 --> 00:27:26,221
Heard that you had
arrived from the Gulf...

181
00:27:27,133 --> 00:27:29,533
Sister was telling
me about the matters here.

182
00:27:30,737 --> 00:27:31,726
Its okay...

183
00:27:32,105 --> 00:27:33,037
He's not an outsider.

184
00:27:33,106 --> 00:27:34,630
- Did you give him tea?
- I had tea.

185
00:27:34,707 --> 00:27:36,106
I'll have a cup of tea please.

186
00:27:36,409 --> 00:27:37,671
Move out of the way.

187
00:27:38,111 --> 00:27:39,635
How are things with you, Brother?

188
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:42,240
Getting on.

189
00:27:43,449 --> 00:27:44,677
Give her the milk.

190
00:27:44,751 --> 00:27:46,446
lm worried about Joshua...

191
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,779
God will show us a way.

192
00:27:52,358 --> 00:27:55,088
If you want...
I can take him with me.

193
00:27:56,062 --> 00:27:57,120
To the Gulf?

194
00:27:57,630 --> 00:28:00,599
At this age, what can he do there?

195
00:28:00,733 --> 00:28:04,066
Leave that to me.
If he starts earning,

196
00:28:04,337 --> 00:28:06,532
it will be good for her.

197
00:28:08,074 --> 00:28:10,099
Isn't he still a child?

198
00:28:10,643 --> 00:28:12,406
Not really...

199
00:28:26,426 --> 00:28:27,688
The train is here.

200
00:29:16,109 --> 00:29:17,076
Bro!

201
00:29:59,052 --> 00:30:00,576
Thommicha, shall I serve some more?

202
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,483
Joshua, come have dinner.

203
00:30:08,061 --> 00:30:12,555
Aloshy has the contract
to fix all broken toys in our area.

204
00:30:13,266 --> 00:30:16,258
Please have your gruel, Lilly.
Have some...

205
00:30:17,103 --> 00:30:18,434
Lilly... please.

206
00:30:18,738 --> 00:30:21,502
Broken toys can be repaired.

207
00:30:22,108 --> 00:30:24,804
Not the same with people.

208
00:30:36,055 --> 00:30:36,680
Hey!

209
00:30:37,323 --> 00:30:38,688
Doggie... Go!

210
00:30:39,058 --> 00:30:39,786
Jimmy go...

211
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:41,292
What happened?

212
00:30:41,461 --> 00:30:42,655
- Tommy?
- What is it, Yoshe?

213
00:30:43,796 --> 00:30:46,162
This dog...

214
00:30:46,299 --> 00:30:48,494
He is used to sleeping here with Jenny...

215
00:30:49,068 --> 00:30:49,557
Come.

216
00:30:50,403 --> 00:30:51,665
lam talking to you.
Come!

217
00:30:52,472 --> 00:30:53,234
Move...

218
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,532
You shut the door & sleep.

219
00:30:55,708 --> 00:30:56,436
Okay.

220
00:30:58,311 --> 00:31:00,438
Tonight, you sleep here okay?

221
00:31:24,303 --> 00:31:26,328
Finally all the rituals are done.

222
00:31:27,073 --> 00:31:28,597
Does Joshua plan to go back?

223
00:31:29,041 --> 00:31:30,531
I haven't asked him anything.

224
00:31:31,043 --> 00:31:31,566
Joshua...

225
00:31:34,313 --> 00:31:35,678
Joshua, when are you leaving?

226
00:31:36,682 --> 00:31:40,243
Once things have settled here...
In 2 or 3 days.

227
00:31:44,524 --> 00:31:46,583
Granny, have your medicines and go.

228
00:31:46,826 --> 00:31:48,316
I don't want any of it.

229
00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:51,792
Granny... Please have these.

230
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:54,464
- I told you I dont want to
- You will start talking to yourself again.

231
00:31:54,534 --> 00:31:57,094
Please have these.
Granny, listen to me...

232
00:32:02,241 --> 00:32:04,368
Yoshe,
You don't have to go back.

233
00:32:05,645 --> 00:32:07,510
I have to.
There is a lot of work I have taken up.

234
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,272
- Have to go.
- What work?

235
00:32:09,482 --> 00:32:12,076
Your home, your people are here.

236
00:32:12,151 --> 00:32:14,176
What will you do there all alone?

237
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,083
Hasn't it always been that way?

238
00:32:23,796 --> 00:32:25,320
What must I do then?

239
00:32:25,565 --> 00:32:27,294
What is the point in
making these cakes and stew

240
00:32:27,366 --> 00:32:29,163
if he will also be gone?

241
00:32:32,472 --> 00:32:35,635
Years ago... Your mother
would have felt the same way

242
00:32:36,108 --> 00:32:37,370
That's why we brought her here, right?

243
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:39,137
After she became what she is now...

244
00:32:39,345 --> 00:32:40,403
Our daughter is...

245
00:32:42,381 --> 00:32:44,372
Don't you want at least him around?

246
00:32:54,694 --> 00:32:56,389
Granny and her ways!

247
00:32:59,765 --> 00:33:01,426
Aren't they very expensive?

248
00:33:01,701 --> 00:33:03,532
I can return them to the hospital...

249
00:33:15,681 --> 00:33:16,545
Yoshe!

250
00:33:40,706 --> 00:33:41,570
Yoshe!

251
00:33:43,643 --> 00:33:45,668
Good Morning, everyone please rise

252
00:33:45,745 --> 00:33:48,543
for the morning prayer
by principal Ms. Katy.

253
00:33:51,617 --> 00:33:53,585
Where the mind is without fear,

254
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,610
and the head is held high,

255
00:33:55,688 --> 00:33:58,452
where knowledge is free, where the world

256
00:33:58,491 --> 00:34:01,289
is not being broken up into fragments

257
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,385
by narrow domestic walls.

258
00:34:03,596 --> 00:34:04,585
Wate r!

259
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,296
Joe! Can I play as well?

260
00:34:13,472 --> 00:34:14,404
No.

261
00:34:15,207 --> 00:34:16,640
Just bring me water when I ask for it.

262
00:34:16,709 --> 00:34:19,075
But you promised that
you would let me play next week!

263
00:34:19,178 --> 00:34:20,406
It's not next week yet.

264
00:34:20,479 --> 00:34:22,106
You promised last week!

265
00:34:22,214 --> 00:34:23,146
No, No.

266
00:34:23,349 --> 00:34:24,373
Why cant she play?

267
00:34:24,483 --> 00:34:26,280
Coach wont let girls on the team.

268
00:34:26,419 --> 00:34:27,408
Says who?

269
00:34:28,754 --> 00:34:30,016
Pass her the ball.

270
00:34:30,156 --> 00:34:30,781
Coach! Don't!

271
00:34:31,090 --> 00:34:32,523
She can only play better than you.

272
00:34:33,125 --> 00:34:33,750
Come play.

273
00:34:36,295 --> 00:34:37,193
I'll show you.

274
00:34:45,237 --> 00:34:46,795
Yeah...
good.

275
00:34:47,173 --> 00:34:48,071
Thanks.

276
00:34:50,743 --> 00:34:51,801
Please sit down.

277
00:34:56,515 --> 00:34:58,608
We have gathered here today

278
00:34:58,784 --> 00:35:02,242
for the condolence meeting
of our beloved student,

279
00:35:02,388 --> 00:35:04,618
Late Jennifer Maria Thomas.

280
00:35:04,757 --> 00:35:08,193
We have her family with us here and

281
00:35:08,427 --> 00:35:12,022
I welcome our former
Principal Sister to the dais

282
00:35:12,131 --> 00:35:14,599
to share her memories with Jennifer.

283
00:35:15,034 --> 00:35:16,126
Ma'am please...

284
00:35:24,677 --> 00:35:26,508
We are left with just hundred days.

285
00:35:26,579 --> 00:35:28,069
- for your board exams.
- Good morning ma'am!

286
00:35:28,214 --> 00:35:30,444
- Sorry am late
- Joshua Thomas! Stay there.

287
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:32,342
What do you think about yourself?

288
00:35:32,485 --> 00:35:34,476
You can enter the class
any time you want?

289
00:35:34,553 --> 00:35:36,680
You are not going to
attend this hour today ok?

290
00:35:37,023 --> 00:35:38,547
Stay there right in the corner.

291
00:35:38,758 --> 00:35:40,419
Students attention please!

292
00:35:40,493 --> 00:35:44,361
The school is expecting
hundred percent results this year.

293
00:35:44,497 --> 00:35:47,091
So, are you going to be responsible?

294
00:35:47,199 --> 00:35:48,427
Yes ma'am.

295
00:35:48,501 --> 00:35:53,165
Our students will now share
their memories of Jenny...

296
00:35:55,675 --> 00:35:57,802
I'm Sidhartha, 6th Standard.

297
00:35:58,310 --> 00:36:02,974
Jenny was like my own sister.
We met during music classes.

298
00:36:03,182 --> 00:36:05,548
I was too shy to sing those days.

299
00:36:05,618 --> 00:36:08,610
Once when my teacher scolded me, I cried.

300
00:36:09,021 --> 00:36:12,980
Jenny took me to
the terrace and taught me a song.

301
00:36:13,259 --> 00:36:16,751
It was Jenny who taught
me to sing from my heart.

302
00:36:17,096 --> 00:36:19,587
I shall sing that song for her today.

303
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:35,444
"Daddy & Mummy are not around
No one to hold us back

304
00:36:35,514 --> 00:36:39,006
Come on over, lets start the game.

305
00:36:39,085 --> 00:36:46,321
No need for a pitch, No need for
an umpire, and everyones a winner!

306
00:36:46,525 --> 00:36:50,325
Hey.. Daddy & Mummy..."

307
00:36:50,496 --> 00:36:52,123
Stop it!

308
00:36:54,433 --> 00:36:55,559
The meeting is over.

309
00:36:55,634 --> 00:36:57,761
and thank you everyone
for your presence.

310
00:36:58,137 --> 00:36:59,536
- The song had not finished.
- Stop it.

311
00:36:59,772 --> 00:37:02,240
Thank you so much to Jennifer's family

312
00:37:02,308 --> 00:37:03,741
for being with us here.

313
00:37:04,276 --> 00:37:07,245
What was wrong with that principal!

314
00:37:10,249 --> 00:37:11,181
Stop.

315
00:37:11,984 --> 00:37:14,544
Let's not take this route,
take that one.

316
00:37:15,654 --> 00:37:19,613
Biju Varkey's house is on this road.
This is his car.

317
00:37:24,730 --> 00:37:26,561
Why do we still do this, Dad?

318
00:37:27,299 --> 00:37:31,292
Since I remember we
have been using others' cars.

319
00:37:31,604 --> 00:37:32,696
So what?

320
00:37:33,272 --> 00:37:35,240
They're lying in our garage anyway.

321
00:37:39,245 --> 00:37:41,372
Can't we just buy a new car?

322
00:37:43,082 --> 00:37:45,573
A new one would cost a lot.

323
00:37:47,686 --> 00:37:49,677
Isn't that what I am for?

324
00:37:53,058 --> 00:37:54,457
How much will you do?

325
00:37:55,394 --> 00:37:56,759
Why spare me for just this one?

326
00:38:06,305 --> 00:38:07,704
Open the bonnet.

327
00:38:13,612 --> 00:38:16,046
That boy sang really well, didn't he?

328
00:38:25,324 --> 00:38:26,655
Spark plug...

329
00:38:27,493 --> 00:38:29,324
Thought it was cleaned.

330
00:38:30,196 --> 00:38:31,322
- Step out.
- Why?

331
00:38:31,597 --> 00:38:34,691
The car needs to be pushed.
The car isnt starting.

332
00:38:37,703 --> 00:38:40,171
He never likes it
when I get into the car!

333
00:38:46,545 --> 00:38:49,343
I used to be a nurse
Now, I'm doing a mechanic's work.

334
00:38:50,049 --> 00:38:53,382
He is taking out all his anger
and making me do this on purpose.

335
00:38:53,619 --> 00:38:56,144
Come on, you know its not that.

336
00:38:59,091 --> 00:39:00,183
- Dad...
-Yes.

337
00:39:00,626 --> 00:39:02,025
Let's buy a new car.

338
00:39:03,195 --> 00:39:04,321
No, Yoshe!

339
00:39:05,164 --> 00:39:05,994
Dad...

340
00:39:06,465 --> 00:39:07,261
Yes.

341
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:10,330
Is there a vehicle that works?

342
00:39:10,736 --> 00:39:12,431
Just wanted to go for a drive.

343
00:39:20,546 --> 00:39:21,570
Take the van.

344
00:39:23,015 --> 00:39:24,642
That won't ditch you midway.

345
00:39:28,721 --> 00:39:31,019
It was Jenny's ambulance.

346
00:39:32,424 --> 00:39:35,154
Good that the Sahib left it here.

347
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,498
Where is he off to at this hour?

348
00:39:43,669 --> 00:39:44,693
It is getting dark.

349
00:39:47,373 --> 00:39:50,171
Don't nag him like
you used to nag Jenny.

350
00:39:50,342 --> 00:39:51,673
He is not a small kid.

351
00:39:51,744 --> 00:39:53,473
Not the age to roam around either.

352
00:39:53,545 --> 00:39:54,705
What would people say?

353
00:39:54,747 --> 00:39:55,611
That's true.

354
00:39:55,681 --> 00:39:58,013
People are just are waiting to gossip.

355
00:39:58,550 --> 00:39:59,710
Its not "people"...

356
00:40:00,252 --> 00:40:01,719
I know the one who gossips around here.

357
00:40:46,799 --> 00:40:47,629
Hello?

358
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:05,648
Hi!

359
00:42:02,441 --> 00:42:03,203
Hi!

360
00:42:15,487 --> 00:42:16,249
Hi!

361
00:43:43,742 --> 00:43:45,073
Don't be scared.

362
00:43:45,277 --> 00:43:46,403
It's me.

363
00:43:47,713 --> 00:43:49,078
Who?

364
00:43:49,314 --> 00:43:50,713
What kind of question is that?

365
00:43:50,782 --> 00:43:52,044
Its me Jenny.

366
00:43:52,117 --> 00:43:53,084
Jenny?

367
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:56,582
Jenny is gone.

368
00:43:58,190 --> 00:43:59,350
That's true.

369
00:44:00,058 --> 00:44:01,252
But I still am Jenny.

370
00:44:01,593 --> 00:44:03,026
You're not Jenny.

371
00:44:04,062 --> 00:44:06,690
You just look like Jenny.

372
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:09,089
Tell me the truth.

373
00:44:10,269 --> 00:44:11,361
Who are you?

374
00:44:13,472 --> 00:44:15,167
You only see me once
every four years.

375
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:17,105
How can you say I am not Jenny?

376
00:44:18,143 --> 00:44:20,134
Since the last time,
haven't I grown taller?

377
00:44:20,312 --> 00:44:21,404
What do you want?

378
00:44:21,613 --> 00:44:22,773
What do I want?

379
00:44:23,148 --> 00:44:24,274
Nothing!

380
00:44:24,616 --> 00:44:25,708
But I am Jenny.

381
00:44:27,486 --> 00:44:31,149
Even if you are Jenny.
How are you here?

382
00:44:31,190 --> 00:44:32,782
I don't know either.

383
00:44:33,158 --> 00:44:34,216
It's so confusing.

384
00:44:34,326 --> 00:44:35,725
It's a first for me too.

385
00:44:36,128 --> 00:44:40,155
Don't know if I am coming or going!

386
00:44:41,166 --> 00:44:42,758
- Don't be loud!
- Why not?!

387
00:44:43,168 --> 00:44:44,692
The only person who can see and hear me

388
00:44:45,070 --> 00:44:46,799
does not even understand anything!

389
00:44:47,639 --> 00:44:48,606
I'm hungry!

390
00:44:49,141 --> 00:44:50,108
Hungry?

391
00:44:50,309 --> 00:44:55,269
Yeah! I've heard all that too.
About how it is when you die. All lies!

392
00:44:55,414 --> 00:44:57,177
Full wrong information!

393
00:44:57,249 --> 00:45:02,084
Look at me now...
I'm not transparent. I can't fly.

394
00:45:02,154 --> 00:45:05,089
My hands, legs, teeth, all are normal.

395
00:45:05,390 --> 00:45:08,257
And that thing about roaming
around in the white-saree uniform?

396
00:45:08,327 --> 00:45:09,259
All bogus!

397
00:45:09,328 --> 00:45:10,761
Cooked up by filmmakers.

398
00:45:11,063 --> 00:45:12,257
But there's one thing...

399
00:45:14,666 --> 00:45:15,758
No breathlessness.

400
00:45:16,134 --> 00:45:16,657
No pain.

401
00:45:17,402 --> 00:45:18,460
Such a relief!

402
00:45:20,005 --> 00:45:21,472
Poor Mamma & Dad...

403
00:45:21,673 --> 00:45:24,540
For every small thing they
had to rush me to the hospital.

404
00:45:25,210 --> 00:45:27,337
No need for any of that now full chill!

405
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:29,747
Now! I am going to have a blast!

406
00:45:32,551 --> 00:45:35,384
Only one thing has not changed...

407
00:45:35,554 --> 00:45:37,146
Always hungry!

408
00:45:38,357 --> 00:45:39,722
Mamma's coffee...

409
00:45:40,325 --> 00:45:43,453
The yummy treats...
Appam & stew.

410
00:45:44,162 --> 00:45:45,789
Please go get me something!

411
00:45:49,401 --> 00:45:52,802
Please, at least get me
a bun omlette from the stall

412
00:45:54,806 --> 00:45:55,602
Hello!

413
00:46:09,121 --> 00:46:10,520
You got up early?

414
00:46:10,722 --> 00:46:12,587
- Shall I get you coffee?
- Yes please.

415
00:46:13,325 --> 00:46:15,156
The workers will arrive soon.

416
00:46:24,069 --> 00:46:30,030
Jenny... did she have a last wish?

417
00:46:30,208 --> 00:46:33,336
She was twenty years old.

418
00:46:35,147 --> 00:46:37,274
She had not one, but a thousand wishes.

419
00:46:42,087 --> 00:46:45,022
Till the end,
she asked if you would come.

420
00:46:47,025 --> 00:46:48,151
I'm taking this.

421
00:46:48,327 --> 00:46:49,021
Okay.

422
00:46:58,337 --> 00:46:59,201
Hi!

423
00:47:00,238 --> 00:47:01,068
Hello!

424
00:47:01,139 --> 00:47:02,106
He can see?

425
00:47:02,174 --> 00:47:05,268
Of course,
he's my best friend "Brownie"!

426
00:47:05,744 --> 00:47:06,438
Brownie?

427
00:47:06,678 --> 00:47:08,111
But, he's not brown.

428
00:47:08,246 --> 00:47:09,645
Such old school thinking!

429
00:47:09,748 --> 00:47:13,206
Calling a brown dog Brownie,
needs no imagination.

430
00:47:13,352 --> 00:47:15,445
See this brown patch?
That's his specialty... so "Brownie".

431
00:47:15,754 --> 00:47:16,448
Coffee.

432
00:47:16,988 --> 00:47:17,716
Thank you.

433
00:47:19,758 --> 00:47:20,986
What's for breakfast?

434
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:38,000
- Take a count of the chairs.
- Okay.

435
00:47:39,745 --> 00:47:42,737
- Rajiv, if you need any rope,
it is in the van. - Okay.

436
00:47:44,249 --> 00:47:45,511
Keep the bamboos on that side.

437
00:48:03,635 --> 00:48:05,694
One bun omlette...

438
00:48:06,071 --> 00:48:07,698
- One bun omlette. Make it quick.
- I'm making it!

439
00:48:08,006 --> 00:48:08,995
"Making it!"

440
00:48:09,074 --> 00:48:10,200
That'd be 20 rupees.

441
00:48:11,209 --> 00:48:12,369
I'll take it.
I'm the boss!

442
00:48:12,411 --> 00:48:13,343
Take it!

443
00:48:13,412 --> 00:48:15,107
- You do your job.
- Okay!

444
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:16,408
Trying to show off all the time.

445
00:48:19,418 --> 00:48:22,216
Is there someone in the van?

446
00:48:23,522 --> 00:48:24,489
Isn't that your van?

447
00:48:24,623 --> 00:48:27,114
Stop gossiping and start working.

448
00:48:27,392 --> 00:48:29,360
I was only answering his question.

449
00:48:29,428 --> 00:48:31,658
I see you only talking not working.

450
00:48:45,343 --> 00:48:46,037
Hello!

451
00:48:46,111 --> 00:48:46,736
Eat up.

452
00:48:47,012 --> 00:48:48,138
Salam valeikum sir...

453
00:48:48,413 --> 00:48:51,246
Sir, I will return by Saturday.

454
00:48:51,416 --> 00:48:52,474
Will not.

455
00:48:53,485 --> 00:48:55,783
I have some more
things to get done here.

456
00:48:56,221 --> 00:48:58,348
Hello hello...

457
00:48:59,124 --> 00:49:00,148
Who was that?

458
00:49:00,225 --> 00:49:01,419
My supervisor from the site.

459
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:02,688
What do you do there?

460
00:49:04,029 --> 00:49:05,428
What difference does it make?

461
00:49:06,264 --> 00:49:08,323
How can you say that?

462
00:49:08,467 --> 00:49:10,435
Don't I need to know,
what work you do?

463
00:49:11,436 --> 00:49:13,301
All the needs here are being met.

464
00:49:13,505 --> 00:49:15,166
That's all you need to know.

465
00:49:16,107 --> 00:49:16,732
What?

466
00:49:19,044 --> 00:49:21,535
Hameedikka,
Isn't that Louis's Sahib's van?

467
00:49:22,380 --> 00:49:24,575
Should I be gossiping with you or work?

468
00:49:24,749 --> 00:49:26,239
Heavens!
Please, work.

469
00:49:26,318 --> 00:49:27,307
Hello...

470
00:49:27,519 --> 00:49:29,453
You are into smuggling right?

471
00:49:31,590 --> 00:49:34,184
How can you not like what
you're doing?

472
00:49:34,292 --> 00:49:37,557
People study & work not because
they like it but because they need to.

473
00:49:37,729 --> 00:49:38,718
Says who?

474
00:49:39,197 --> 00:49:41,290
I used to love studying.

475
00:49:41,366 --> 00:49:43,698
College life is so much fun you know...

476
00:49:46,371 --> 00:49:48,339
I would not know.
I could never attend college.

477
00:50:33,818 --> 00:50:36,082
- Do you like football?
- Yes.

478
00:50:36,187 --> 00:50:37,415
To play
or just to watch?

479
00:50:37,489 --> 00:50:39,616
The coach wouldn't let us just watch.

480
00:50:40,158 --> 00:50:41,284
I was in the school team.

481
00:50:41,693 --> 00:50:43,627
Where are your old teammates?

482
00:50:46,264 --> 00:50:47,322
Don't know.

483
00:50:52,571 --> 00:50:54,539
How old where you when you left?

484
00:50:55,340 --> 00:50:56,204
Fifteen.

485
00:50:56,541 --> 00:50:57,667
Weren't you scared?

486
00:50:57,842 --> 00:50:59,400
To leave home and everyone behind?

487
00:51:04,583 --> 00:51:05,550
Forget that.

488
00:51:06,117 --> 00:51:07,550
Where're your school friends?

489
00:51:07,686 --> 00:51:09,119
There isnt anyone like that.

490
00:51:10,255 --> 00:51:13,053
Who'd remember someone who
visits only once in 4 or 5 years...?

491
00:51:13,158 --> 00:51:14,648
You're not in touch with anyone?

492
00:51:15,126 --> 00:51:17,185
Over phone or mail?
(A beat)

493
00:51:17,729 --> 00:51:19,287
I sent a letter once...

494
00:51:23,301 --> 00:51:25,428
Brother! Ball...

495
00:51:40,051 --> 00:51:41,484
Come on... pass pass

496
00:51:41,553 --> 00:51:43,111
Josh... Pass

497
00:51:43,355 --> 00:51:44,322
Pass...

498
00:51:45,557 --> 00:51:47,684
Pass! Joshua pass!

499
00:51:48,059 --> 00:51:50,118
Block him block him
Don't let him go.

500
00:51:50,195 --> 00:51:51,719
Josh, pass the ball to Devan!

501
00:52:02,574 --> 00:52:04,337
You guys are good for nothing!

502
00:52:07,712 --> 00:52:09,441
All of you remember one thing.

503
00:52:09,714 --> 00:52:12,376
The one who moves the ball doesn't
necessarily need to score the goal...

504
00:52:12,517 --> 00:52:14,508
It doesn't matter who scores the goal.

505
00:52:14,619 --> 00:52:15,586
It's the team's goal.

506
00:52:15,654 --> 00:52:19,556
I want each one of you
to do what you are best at.

507
00:52:20,291 --> 00:52:20,780
0k?

508
00:52:28,133 --> 00:52:29,464
Nice kick Bro!

509
00:52:33,571 --> 00:52:34,196
Bro?

510
00:52:34,272 --> 00:52:36,672
Brother...
Bro...Short form.

511
00:52:39,678 --> 00:52:41,305
Will your old scrap run?

512
00:52:41,446 --> 00:52:43,505
Hey! Don't call her names.

513
00:52:43,581 --> 00:52:44,605
She's just upset.

514
00:52:44,683 --> 00:52:46,651
If you're mean to me,
shell get upset.

515
00:52:47,385 --> 00:52:49,615
You just need to give her a little
push & she'll be fine.

516
00:52:53,525 --> 00:52:54,719
"Push push"

517
00:52:54,793 --> 00:52:56,090
"Push push"

518
00:52:56,161 --> 00:52:58,152
"Push the old van"

519
00:52:58,229 --> 00:52:59,287
"Push push"

520
00:52:59,364 --> 00:53:00,296
"Push push"

521
00:53:00,365 --> 00:53:01,627
"Push the hopeless van"

522
00:53:03,601 --> 00:53:04,499
Get in get in!

523
00:53:04,569 --> 00:53:08,471
"Push the old van!"

524
00:53:08,540 --> 00:53:11,600
"Push the hopeless van!"

525
00:53:11,676 --> 00:53:15,237
"Push the old van!"

526
00:53:15,313 --> 00:53:18,305
"Push the hopeless van!"

527
00:53:18,383 --> 00:53:21,011
"Push the old van!"

528
00:53:21,086 --> 00:53:23,680
"Push the hopeless van!"

529
00:53:29,794 --> 00:53:31,421
Thanks a lot brother!

530
00:53:32,063 --> 00:53:34,395
Bro! Shall we get everyone some sweets?

531
00:53:42,707 --> 00:53:44,402
Bro, can I ask you something?

532
00:53:44,676 --> 00:53:47,577
Will you really leave in 2 days?

533
00:53:48,046 --> 00:53:49,070
Yes.

534
00:53:54,753 --> 00:53:56,380
Give me the phone.

535
00:53:57,756 --> 00:53:59,451
- Why?
- Give it!

536
00:54:01,626 --> 00:54:04,527
Smart phone cool!

537
00:54:06,264 --> 00:54:08,198
So many updates are pending!

538
00:54:08,266 --> 00:54:09,358
I don't check all that.

539
00:54:09,501 --> 00:54:11,230
They gave it to me from the office.

540
00:54:11,436 --> 00:54:12,596
Only they call me on it.

541
00:54:13,171 --> 00:54:14,502
In that case, let this be with me.

542
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:16,332
To call who?

543
00:54:17,242 --> 00:54:19,176
Are phones just for calling?

544
00:54:19,310 --> 00:54:21,335
Food, Clothing, Shelter, Wifi are...

545
00:54:21,412 --> 00:54:23,710
...our generation's fundamental needs!

546
00:54:24,449 --> 00:54:25,609
Brownie! Move.

547
00:54:30,355 --> 00:54:32,380
Bro, can I guess
what you were just thinking?

548
00:54:32,457 --> 00:54:33,185
Good lord...

549
00:54:33,258 --> 00:54:35,249
...she is like this being from here...

550
00:54:35,326 --> 00:54:37,260
...what if she were raised in a city!

551
00:54:37,328 --> 00:54:38,056
Am I right?

552
00:54:38,196 --> 00:54:40,494
Something like that.

553
00:54:40,565 --> 00:54:43,193
I would've been
better off if I was from the city.

554
00:54:43,401 --> 00:54:44,493
Did you know that

555
00:54:44,769 --> 00:54:48,500
the most shocking stories
are from small towns?

556
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:50,769
Ask our Thresiyamma...

557
00:54:51,509 --> 00:54:55,809
...she's the gossip express of our town.

558
00:55:02,187 --> 00:55:04,985
Aloshy is more worried
about Yoshe than I am.

559
00:55:07,492 --> 00:55:09,016
But he never shows it.

560
00:55:09,327 --> 00:55:13,491
How'd you survive by
yourself in that big house, Mother?

561
00:55:13,765 --> 00:55:15,733
I wasn't alone there.

562
00:55:17,468 --> 00:55:20,767
I'm not able to do anything
even with everyone around.

563
00:55:21,072 --> 00:55:23,006
Cannot even enter her room...

564
00:55:25,210 --> 00:55:26,768
- Repair uncle!
- Yes...

565
00:55:27,345 --> 00:55:28,539
The tyres right?

566
00:55:28,780 --> 00:55:30,680
- Don't have a spare?
- Shrugs (No).

567
00:55:30,748 --> 00:55:31,612
We'll fix it.

568
00:55:32,283 --> 00:55:34,046
Come back in two days.

569
00:55:43,027 --> 00:55:44,085
Did the van cause any trouble?

570
00:55:44,229 --> 00:55:45,628
Nothing much...

571
00:55:46,364 --> 00:55:47,626
...loses its cool sometimes.

572
00:55:51,035 --> 00:55:53,094
Aloshy, its string-hoppers for dinner.

573
00:55:54,706 --> 00:55:56,037
Did mother have her food Lilly?

574
00:55:56,074 --> 00:55:58,235
On time, since...

575
00:55:58,309 --> 00:55:59,537
...she is on medications.

576
00:55:59,711 --> 00:56:01,474
Joshua,
some coconut milk?

577
00:56:01,679 --> 00:56:02,304
No.

578
00:56:02,380 --> 00:56:04,348
- Thommicha, some for you?
- Oh yes, please.

579
00:56:04,983 --> 00:56:06,575
These taste best with coconut milk

580
00:56:08,419 --> 00:56:10,182
Get a haircut tomorrow.

581
00:56:10,355 --> 00:56:11,982
You're going to see a prospective bride.

582
00:56:13,591 --> 00:56:15,081
Oh, I thought you were talking to me.

583
00:56:15,260 --> 00:56:16,352
Dont be silly.

584
00:56:17,662 --> 00:56:19,527
Where is this girl from, Thommicha?

585
00:56:19,631 --> 00:56:21,155
- Where is she from sister?
- From Gudalur.

586
00:56:21,266 --> 00:56:23,996
I've told them,
that you said no to quite a few women.

587
00:56:24,035 --> 00:56:25,502
So they need to call us
only if she's a good match.

588
00:56:25,637 --> 00:56:28,003
Wasn't him who rejected those women.

589
00:56:28,072 --> 00:56:29,039
What does he know?

590
00:56:29,173 --> 00:56:30,663
We elders must decide these things.

591
00:56:30,742 --> 00:56:32,676
Thommichan has been very understanding.

592
00:56:32,744 --> 00:56:35,144
Not everyone is like that nowadays.

593
00:56:35,246 --> 00:56:37,237
Did you hear about
the girl from Meleparambu?

594
00:56:37,315 --> 00:56:38,782
She has surely lost her mind.

595
00:56:39,050 --> 00:56:41,075
Sophie... didn't she study with you?

596
00:56:41,419 --> 00:56:42,078
Yes.

597
00:56:42,487 --> 00:56:44,352
- Is she of his age?
- Yes.

598
00:56:44,489 --> 00:56:46,514
Men may come
home drunk and talk rubbish.

599
00:56:46,591 --> 00:56:49,151
Doesn't mean you leave them.

600
00:56:49,294 --> 00:56:53,162
Educated women these days
won't put up with that.

601
00:56:53,331 --> 00:56:55,697
That's the problem, education!

602
00:56:55,767 --> 00:56:58,497
She's a teacher at the school now.

603
00:56:58,569 --> 00:57:01,299
Latest news is that
she went for a divorce.

604
00:57:01,739 --> 00:57:04,037
Divorce?
Why would she go for that?

605
00:57:04,075 --> 00:57:05,508
She was adamant on getting it.

606
00:57:05,610 --> 00:57:07,601
He's no saint.

607
00:57:08,179 --> 00:57:09,737
I've heard that he is an alcoholic.

608
00:57:10,048 --> 00:57:12,016
Not everyone is as decent as Thommichan.

609
00:57:13,518 --> 00:57:16,009
What does Brownie have for dinner?

610
00:57:16,154 --> 00:57:17,644
Whatever we have.

611
00:57:18,022 --> 00:57:19,080
I'll feed him tonight.

612
00:57:19,524 --> 00:57:21,151
Why're you taking the plate along?

613
00:57:21,259 --> 00:57:23,022
- Well leave it outside for him.
- It's okay.

614
00:57:23,061 --> 00:57:24,153
I'll feed him.

615
00:57:24,762 --> 00:57:25,626
Brownie!

616
00:57:28,066 --> 00:57:30,125
- What has happened to him?
- Just let him be.

617
00:57:30,768 --> 00:57:34,704
Tomorrow when you get a haircut,
please make it a bit fashionable.

618
00:57:37,108 --> 00:57:38,507
This head?

619
00:57:45,016 --> 00:57:46,142
Brownie, come!

620
00:57:53,257 --> 00:57:54,724
Greedy boy!
Its for me.

621
00:58:04,435 --> 00:58:05,333
Take this.

622
00:58:05,536 --> 00:58:07,470
Check it properly
before handing it over.

623
00:58:07,638 --> 00:58:08,468
Yoshe!

624
00:58:09,607 --> 00:58:10,699
Are you going into town?

625
00:58:11,309 --> 00:58:11,741
Yes.

626
00:58:12,043 --> 00:58:14,341
I'm coming along.
Need to get some cash from the bank.

627
00:58:14,579 --> 00:58:15,671
I'll withdraw the money and bring it.

628
00:58:15,747 --> 00:58:17,977
It's okay. I'll go.

629
00:58:18,082 --> 00:58:20,642
Need around
ten-twelve thousand rupees.

630
00:58:20,718 --> 00:58:21,685
to pay for the congregation.

631
00:58:21,986 --> 00:58:23,647
That's okay.

632
00:58:24,389 --> 00:58:25,321
I'll bring it.

633
00:58:25,990 --> 00:58:27,116
Brownie come...

634
00:58:50,248 --> 00:58:52,148
Work-home, home-work...

635
00:58:52,417 --> 00:58:54,009
How can you live like this?

636
00:58:54,152 --> 00:58:56,347
There is so much to see in this world.

637
00:58:59,424 --> 00:59:02,484
On picnics from school & college...
I was never allowed to go.

638
00:59:03,027 --> 00:59:03,493
Why?

639
00:59:03,561 --> 00:59:05,995
May be because Id have
to carry an oxygen cylinder along.

640
00:59:10,168 --> 00:59:11,226
So annoying!

641
00:59:11,402 --> 00:59:12,460
Get out of the way!

642
00:59:12,637 --> 00:59:15,037
- Getting on my nerves
- Bro, you tell him!

643
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:18,336
"No one knows, when
and how I arrive..."

644
00:59:18,476 --> 00:59:21,172
"But I am always there where
I am supposed to be!" (Film dialogue)

645
00:59:21,379 --> 00:59:23,973
- Back up now!
- Brother...

646
00:59:24,148 --> 00:59:26,207
Okay maam. It was their fault

647
00:59:26,451 --> 00:59:28,419
Don't worry, lets leave.

648
00:59:45,436 --> 00:59:49,304
Bro! that connection...

649
00:59:50,608 --> 00:59:53,543
So, that letter you
wrote was to Sophie right!

650
00:59:54,579 --> 00:59:57,514
Two coffees and two vadas please.

651
00:59:57,782 --> 00:59:59,682
Two coffees and two vadas here...!

652
01:00:00,284 --> 01:00:03,219
lsnt this Louis Sahibs van?

653
01:00:03,421 --> 01:00:05,048
Yeah, it is some Sahib's.

654
01:00:05,189 --> 01:00:08,056
But this was with Aloshy.
How'd you get it?

655
01:00:08,192 --> 01:00:09,056
He's my dad.

656
01:00:09,427 --> 01:00:10,223
Good God!

657
01:00:10,461 --> 01:00:12,793
- Are you his son who works
in the Gulf? - Yes.

658
01:00:13,064 --> 01:00:14,122
Come inside, take a seat.

659
01:00:14,198 --> 01:00:15,222
Please take a seat.

660
01:00:16,100 --> 01:00:19,160
Aloshy always talks
about you when he comes.

661
01:00:20,037 --> 01:00:21,561
Do you know the story of this van?

662
01:00:21,739 --> 01:00:22,671
No.

663
01:00:23,508 --> 01:00:25,635
Louis sahib was a
hippie back in the day.

664
01:00:26,077 --> 01:00:28,773
His girlfriend & he used to
roam around the country in this van.

665
01:00:29,046 --> 01:00:32,140
When they finally settled down here,
his girlfriend left him.

666
01:00:32,416 --> 01:00:34,475
Hey, the vadas aren't from today...

667
01:00:34,619 --> 01:00:36,246
Get some of the fresh fritters.

668
01:00:36,687 --> 01:00:38,120
He waited a long time for her.

669
01:00:38,289 --> 01:00:40,621
But she did not show up.

670
01:00:40,791 --> 01:00:44,591
Last year, he heard she fell ill.

671
01:00:45,196 --> 01:00:46,288
He panicked...

672
01:00:46,564 --> 01:00:50,796
He left immediately to France.
The things love makes you do!

673
01:00:51,202 --> 01:00:55,571
He left all his things
with different people to take care.

674
01:00:55,773 --> 01:00:58,105
The van was left with your dad.

675
01:00:59,343 --> 01:01:01,174
Bro! Can I ask you something?

676
01:01:01,546 --> 01:01:03,104
Why're you leaving now?

677
01:01:05,349 --> 01:01:07,078
If not for me,

678
01:01:07,251 --> 01:01:09,219
you could stay back for some others?

679
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:12,284
Like Khadar said...
...things love makes you do!

680
01:01:13,324 --> 01:01:16,350
I thought youd talk less
if you got something to eat.

681
01:01:16,494 --> 01:01:19,088
If I too keep quiet,
this will turn into an art movie.

682
01:01:21,599 --> 01:01:24,762
It must be wonderful
to travel and see the world.

683
01:01:25,203 --> 01:01:26,602
Bro, have you travelled a lot?

684
01:01:27,071 --> 01:01:30,404
Once every four or five years,

685
01:01:30,808 --> 01:01:32,708
I board a plane
to come home

686
01:01:33,044 --> 01:01:34,636
Havent really seen
the world beyond this.

687
01:01:35,079 --> 01:01:36,171
How terrible!
Next time you board a flight,

688
01:01:36,247 --> 01:01:38,215
don't come home
go somewhere else.

689
01:02:19,557 --> 01:02:20,285
Sophie,

690
01:02:24,262 --> 01:02:26,093
your aunt is looking for you.

691
01:02:34,639 --> 01:02:37,073
Can't you keep this aside
at least during dinner?

692
01:02:37,241 --> 01:02:38,731
Mom, just mind your own work.

693
01:02:38,809 --> 01:02:40,436
lam not putting this down.

694
01:02:40,611 --> 01:02:42,579
Only marriage will set him right.

695
01:02:42,680 --> 01:02:45,740
Fr. Immanuel had come with
a proposal for him yesterday.

696
01:02:46,050 --> 01:02:46,482
For me?

697
01:02:46,684 --> 01:02:48,208
The boy is from her husbands family.

698
01:02:48,386 --> 01:02:49,819
Cant call him her husband anymore.

699
01:02:50,154 --> 01:02:52,384
She'll take you to
court for saying that.

700
01:02:53,124 --> 01:02:56,059
Brother, that lawyer had
come to meet her in school today.

701
01:02:56,260 --> 01:02:57,454
To the school?

702
01:02:58,496 --> 01:03:01,294
That school is run
with our family money.

703
01:03:01,532 --> 01:03:03,329
Please don't embarrass us there too.

704
01:03:03,701 --> 01:03:06,192
He dropped by to
hand over some documents.

705
01:03:07,705 --> 01:03:08,637
Ouseppachan!

706
01:03:09,006 --> 01:03:12,237
When our sister was married to you,
we were a reputed family.

707
01:03:12,410 --> 01:03:14,207
Your daughter is
ruining our reputation.

708
01:03:14,378 --> 01:03:18,246
Do you need the money she
makes from her job to survive?

709
01:03:19,116 --> 01:03:21,676
Aren't you being given Alice's
share even after her death?

710
01:03:23,154 --> 01:03:24,382
He has nothing to do with this.

711
01:03:24,588 --> 01:03:26,385
I'm going to work because I want to.

712
01:03:26,657 --> 01:03:27,624
Kariachan...

713
01:03:28,025 --> 01:03:30,220
Isn't she doing a job that she likes?

714
01:03:31,162 --> 01:03:32,356
Dad, didn't I tell you?

715
01:03:32,496 --> 01:03:36,364
She'd do only what she likes. She
has a father who blindly supports her.

716
01:03:38,402 --> 01:03:39,369
Akaame...

717
01:03:39,437 --> 01:03:42,770
You call the girl's mother.
We'll speak to her about the alliance.

718
01:04:03,194 --> 01:04:05,059
Hey! Still sleeping!

719
01:04:06,330 --> 01:04:07,729
Someone is here to see you.

720
01:04:11,702 --> 01:04:13,363
Joshua Aloysius Thomas?

721
01:04:13,571 --> 01:04:15,163
- Yes.
- Sir, these are your orders.

722
01:04:15,339 --> 01:04:16,772
- Please sign here.
- Orders?

723
01:04:17,041 --> 01:04:17,530
Yes.

724
01:04:18,709 --> 01:04:20,267
I haven't ordered anything.

725
01:04:20,444 --> 01:04:22,275
Is the address right?

726
01:04:22,380 --> 01:04:23,472
Isn't this your address, Sir?

727
01:04:23,647 --> 01:04:26,013
The address is mine, but...

728
01:04:26,350 --> 01:04:29,683
I haven't ordered anything.
This must be a mistake.

729
01:04:30,054 --> 01:04:32,682
The delivery is in your name...
So there's no mistake.

730
01:04:33,057 --> 01:04:34,217
Sir could you... Sign it?

731
01:04:34,492 --> 01:04:35,481
Why must I?

732
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:37,388
I have not bought anything.

733
01:04:37,728 --> 01:04:38,558
I'm not paying for these.

734
01:04:38,596 --> 01:04:40,757
No need for payment.
Rs 47,000. Already paid.

735
01:04:41,065 --> 01:04:42,259
47...!

736
01:04:43,801 --> 01:04:44,790
By whom?

737
01:04:45,035 --> 01:04:46,059
Paid by...

738
01:04:46,170 --> 01:04:47,797
It's been paid with your debit card.

739
01:04:48,038 --> 01:04:49,528
But... this is some fraud.

740
01:04:49,573 --> 01:04:52,098
If you have any complaints,
please contact the bank.

741
01:04:52,143 --> 01:04:53,735
Do you have your card with you?

742
01:04:54,044 --> 01:04:55,033
Card...

743
01:04:57,615 --> 01:04:58,377
Yes, I have the card.

744
01:04:58,449 --> 01:05:00,679
Sir, have you given the
password of your card to someone?

745
01:05:00,751 --> 01:05:03,242
No. This card was given
to me by my company.

746
01:05:03,421 --> 01:05:05,753
And I saved the password
only on my phone...

747
01:05:11,228 --> 01:05:13,219
Wow!
Has everything arrived?

748
01:05:13,264 --> 01:05:14,162
What is all this?

749
01:05:14,231 --> 01:05:15,198
What is all this?
Shopping!

750
01:05:15,266 --> 01:05:17,393
Shopping? For 47,000?

751
01:05:18,002 --> 01:05:19,367
You think I am made of money?

752
01:05:19,437 --> 01:05:21,371
Do you know how hard
I work for every rupee?

753
01:05:21,472 --> 01:05:23,064
Not Rupees. You mean Dirhams right?

754
01:05:23,140 --> 01:05:24,539
Don't you understand anything at all?

755
01:05:25,109 --> 01:05:28,203
Did you even ask
me before spending so much?

756
01:05:28,746 --> 01:05:30,771
Aiwa! Our first fight!

757
01:05:31,315 --> 01:05:32,577
Are you acting dumb or...?

758
01:05:32,716 --> 01:05:34,013
Chill Bro!

759
01:05:34,084 --> 01:05:35,415
Let's check if you like all these.

760
01:05:38,255 --> 01:05:39,779
All you'll do is spend!

761
01:05:40,391 --> 01:05:41,585
For everything there's Josh!

762
01:05:42,293 --> 01:05:44,022
For medicines, Josh.
For fees, Josh.

763
01:05:44,094 --> 01:05:45,254
For clothes, Josh!

764
01:05:46,063 --> 01:05:48,258
You act as if I've
demanded all this from you.

765
01:05:48,365 --> 01:05:52,028
Amidst all the money talk,
have you ever really thought about me?

766
01:05:52,203 --> 01:05:55,263
So talking about how much
I spend is the big mistake.

767
01:05:55,306 --> 01:05:57,433
Have you ever
seen me spend for myself?

768
01:05:57,475 --> 01:05:58,635
No!
I haven't.

769
01:05:59,109 --> 01:06:00,736
By spending for me, what did you get?

770
01:06:01,145 --> 01:06:02,544
At least now learn
to live for yourself!

771
01:06:03,481 --> 01:06:05,142
None of these are for me.

772
01:06:05,249 --> 01:06:06,238
All of it is for you.

773
01:06:07,084 --> 01:06:08,278
- For me...?
- If I ask for a phone,

774
01:06:08,385 --> 01:06:09,579
you buy and send one.

775
01:06:09,987 --> 01:06:11,978
But have you ever called me on it?

776
01:06:13,691 --> 01:06:15,318
Give me my phone back.

777
01:06:15,426 --> 01:06:16,518
- No I won't.
- I said, give it back!

778
01:06:16,994 --> 01:06:17,619
No!

779
01:06:18,262 --> 01:06:20,253
Give me my phone back!

780
01:06:30,341 --> 01:06:31,239
You hardly visit...

781
01:06:31,308 --> 01:06:33,173
- Jenny...
- ...even then you barely talk to me!

782
01:06:33,310 --> 01:06:34,106
Go.

783
01:06:44,488 --> 01:06:45,318
Jenny...

784
01:06:46,790 --> 01:06:47,688
Just go.

785
01:06:50,261 --> 01:06:51,023
Jenny...

786
01:09:15,372 --> 01:09:16,236
Boo!

787
01:09:16,707 --> 01:09:18,675
I won't leave that soon!

788
01:09:21,478 --> 01:09:22,376
Me neither.

789
01:09:22,479 --> 01:09:23,503
Then your tickets?

790
01:09:24,615 --> 01:09:27,413
Will cancel them.

791
01:09:27,651 --> 01:09:28,515
Really?

792
01:09:28,686 --> 01:09:29,414
Yeah.

793
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:30,578
Yayyyyy!

794
01:09:31,355 --> 01:09:32,686
- You're sure right?
- Yes

795
01:09:33,090 --> 01:09:34,318
- You give your word?
- Yes

796
01:09:34,458 --> 01:09:35,288
Promise?

797
01:09:35,392 --> 01:09:36,416
- Promise.
- Yes!

798
01:09:41,365 --> 01:09:42,457
So... what's the plan?

799
01:09:42,566 --> 01:09:43,999
The plan...

800
01:09:45,436 --> 01:09:46,198
You tell me.

801
01:09:46,270 --> 01:09:48,397
I will.
Are you sure?

802
01:09:50,474 --> 01:09:51,270
Yes.

803
01:10:12,629 --> 01:10:14,187
What has gone has gone,

804
01:10:14,331 --> 01:10:15,764
What is to come, will come.

805
01:10:16,066 --> 01:10:19,263
What lies in between these...
isn't that what matters?

806
01:10:20,404 --> 01:10:21,029
Think about it!

807
01:10:21,171 --> 01:10:23,537
Like a naughty breeze,

808
01:10:23,607 --> 01:10:26,337
tapping & dancing,

809
01:10:26,510 --> 01:10:31,072
like a maverick dragonﬂy,
did you touch the skjﬂ.

810
01:10:31,582 --> 01:10:36,519
At the blink ofan eye,
did sunshine ﬂow into the night?

811
01:10:37,087 --> 01:10:40,420
Even on the real earth,
did stars start to twinkle?

812
01:10:40,557 --> 01:10:42,787
Stop being such a grouch
& start enjoying your life!

813
01:10:43,260 --> 01:10:44,557
Someday you are going to die anyway.

814
01:10:44,695 --> 01:10:55,230
Far, faraway...
let's seek our shore...

815
01:10:55,539 --> 01:11:05,710
Together... let's gather
to make our nests.

816
01:11:14,558 --> 01:11:15,650
Where's Aloshy?

817
01:11:16,193 --> 01:11:19,526
Did the nameless expanses,

818
01:11:19,663 --> 01:11:22,393
Search for unknown roads?

819
01:11:22,466 --> 01:11:26,664
On some distant branch,
did the little birds ﬁnd new homes?

820
01:11:26,804 --> 01:11:30,433
Forgetting the seasons,

821
01:11:30,474 --> 01:11:33,068
we spread colours on tender leaves.

822
01:11:33,243 --> 01:11:37,339
Let's fuse together,
like rain that seeps into the soil.

823
01:11:38,282 --> 01:11:48,556
Far... Faraway...
let's seek our shore.

824
01:11:48,725 --> 01:11:59,602
Together... let's gather
to make our nests.

825
01:11:59,770 --> 01:12:02,330
Bro!
Brownie's hungry.

826
01:12:02,539 --> 01:12:03,369
Right?

827
01:12:07,578 --> 01:12:08,545
What?

828
01:12:23,260 --> 01:12:25,387
What is he up to with this van?

829
01:12:26,797 --> 01:12:27,786
Don't walk,

830
01:12:28,398 --> 01:12:29,296
Run!

831
01:12:29,566 --> 01:12:30,294
Don't stand,

832
01:12:30,634 --> 01:12:31,532
Fly!

833
01:12:31,635 --> 01:12:35,071
Let's go in search of the
fragrance from an unknown ﬂower.

834
01:12:36,039 --> 01:12:36,801
Bro!

835
01:12:37,608 --> 01:12:39,166
- Shall I jump from here?
- Come!

836
01:12:39,476 --> 01:12:40,465
I'll jump!

837
01:12:40,744 --> 01:12:41,768
I'll jump now!

838
01:12:42,279 --> 01:12:46,147
Let's hum that tune of
the forest that no one has heard.

839
01:12:48,518 --> 01:12:49,314
Jenny”

840
01:12:49,753 --> 01:12:50,549
Jenny

841
01:12:50,654 --> 01:12:51,712
Jenny! Jenny!

842
01:12:53,690 --> 01:12:58,787
Just within my reach, you are...

843
01:12:59,563 --> 01:13:04,626
Just beyond your sight, I am...
like a rapture...

844
01:13:04,701 --> 01:13:15,305
Let's gather the feathers
of the mist, with our thoughts.

845
01:13:15,579 --> 01:13:26,012
Together... let's gather
to make our nests.

846
01:13:40,317 --> 01:13:42,012
Hope you told them
about my commission.

847
01:13:42,085 --> 01:13:43,074
You put your terms forward.

848
01:13:43,153 --> 01:13:46,054
Please tell them about it.
Else, things won't work out.

849
01:13:46,123 --> 01:13:47,818
Can you please shut up?

850
01:13:49,259 --> 01:13:52,319
Not to us. She hears things
that no one else does.

851
01:13:52,863 --> 01:13:54,194
- She's on medication.
- Who is she?

852
01:13:54,331 --> 01:13:55,923
Lilly's mother.

853
01:13:57,067 --> 01:13:58,432
But, the boy is a gem.

854
01:13:59,036 --> 01:13:59,866
That's what matters.

855
01:13:59,970 --> 01:14:01,267
Kochuthresiama asked her to come.

856
01:14:02,539 --> 01:14:03,563
Sit.

857
01:14:04,541 --> 01:14:06,441
Such a handsome fellow!

858
01:14:06,510 --> 01:14:08,478
NRls have a good market nowadays.

859
01:14:08,545 --> 01:14:11,514
I know many suitable girls.

860
01:14:11,581 --> 01:14:13,242
Here, see her?

861
01:14:13,383 --> 01:14:14,407
She's a nurse in the Gulf.

862
01:14:14,484 --> 01:14:15,815
She draws an excellent salary there.

863
01:14:15,886 --> 01:14:19,982
If you don't like her,
take a look at this girl.

864
01:14:20,257 --> 01:14:22,851
Isn't she pretty?
You like her?

865
01:14:22,926 --> 01:14:24,052
You two would make a great couple.

866
01:14:25,162 --> 01:14:25,924
Mamma,

867
01:14:26,530 --> 01:14:27,360
please come.

868
01:14:27,831 --> 01:14:30,061
I think he liked her! Do ask!

869
01:14:33,136 --> 01:14:34,194
Did you like her?

870
01:14:34,438 --> 01:14:35,837
She is recommended by Kochuthresiama.

871
01:14:39,042 --> 01:14:40,066
Let's not do this now.

872
01:14:40,143 --> 01:14:41,872
The second one is
a really good match.

873
01:14:41,945 --> 01:14:44,436
If you marry her,
you could stay back here with us.

874
01:14:47,551 --> 01:14:49,314
At least sometimes,

875
01:14:51,021 --> 01:14:53,387
you must think of others' likes too.

876
01:14:58,562 --> 01:14:59,494
What happened?

877
01:15:01,264 --> 01:15:03,425
He says he doesn't
want to get married now.

878
01:15:03,867 --> 01:15:05,459
Oh, then shall we think of
that girl for Thommichan.

879
01:15:05,802 --> 01:15:08,032
- How does Thomichan look?
- He's very handsome!

880
01:15:08,105 --> 01:15:09,072
- Is it? - Yes.

881
01:15:09,306 --> 01:15:10,830
Then let's do that.

882
01:15:18,915 --> 01:15:21,076
Bro! Which is this place?

883
01:15:23,086 --> 01:15:25,111
We used to play here as kids.

884
01:15:29,426 --> 01:15:30,290
JoshuJ

885
01:15:41,505 --> 01:15:42,403
Found you!

886
01:15:52,282 --> 01:15:53,010
Sorry.

887
01:15:53,083 --> 01:15:55,551
No, its okay.

888
01:16:08,298 --> 01:16:10,129
How are your parents?

889
01:16:13,837 --> 01:16:14,804
They are... okay.

890
01:16:19,576 --> 01:16:20,474
And you?

891
01:16:24,815 --> 01:16:27,079
Do you come here often?

892
01:16:28,485 --> 01:16:30,953
Whenever I need some time to myself.

893
01:16:36,393 --> 01:16:38,156
Which class do you teach at school?

894
01:16:38,462 --> 01:16:39,451
1st standard.

895
01:16:49,306 --> 01:16:50,068
Bro!

896
01:16:50,273 --> 01:16:51,297
Come fast.

897
01:16:51,441 --> 01:16:52,840
What are you doing there?

898
01:16:54,344 --> 01:16:56,938
So... I'll make a move then.

899
01:17:23,974 --> 01:17:24,804
Benjamin!

900
01:17:26,009 --> 01:17:26,976
What's happening here?

901
01:17:27,310 --> 01:17:29,141
Christy, did you see what he did?

902
01:17:31,515 --> 01:17:32,504
Go.

903
01:17:35,018 --> 01:17:36,576
Did you see what he did?

904
01:17:37,888 --> 01:17:39,879
Today it's him. That is all.

905
01:17:42,158 --> 01:17:44,922
Maybe you come across as easy.

906
01:17:46,830 --> 01:17:47,990
Aren't you coming to bed?

907
01:17:48,164 --> 01:17:49,028
Coming.

908
01:17:53,036 --> 01:17:55,527
- What was it there?
- Nothing.

909
01:18:11,922 --> 01:18:14,049
Have to change its oil pump today.

910
01:18:14,491 --> 01:18:16,391
Oil pump...nonsense!

911
01:18:17,961 --> 01:18:18,450
Okay...

912
01:18:18,995 --> 01:18:21,361
So you weren't in touch
with Sophie all this while.

913
01:18:21,531 --> 01:18:25,126
But since you both are here now,
you can be in touch right?

914
01:18:25,368 --> 01:18:26,562
What do you want us to do?

915
01:18:26,836 --> 01:18:28,326
Play football together again?

916
01:18:29,472 --> 01:18:31,099
That's a good idea!

917
01:18:31,808 --> 01:18:34,470
Your favourite
teacher from back then...?

918
01:18:34,878 --> 01:18:35,810
Coach Ashraf...?

919
01:18:36,079 --> 01:18:39,276
Why not ask about him
and start a conversation?

920
01:18:40,417 --> 01:18:43,511
That poor girl seems to
have too much to handle right now.

921
01:18:43,853 --> 01:18:46,151
That's when good friends should
stick by.

922
01:18:46,957 --> 01:18:49,790
In today's times "you
can't follow the one you like,

923
01:18:49,859 --> 01:18:52,760
you have to walk with them"
is what Dulquer Salman says.

924
01:18:52,829 --> 01:18:55,320
But you... on seeing the girl you like,
drive backwards.

925
01:18:55,398 --> 01:18:58,458
- Drop me here.
- You are going to the school right?

926
01:18:58,535 --> 01:19:00,503
- I'll drop you there.
- No, I'm not going to the school.

927
01:19:00,770 --> 01:19:01,794
I'll get off here. You can leave.

928
01:19:01,871 --> 01:19:03,964
Tell me where you are going,
I will drop you there.

929
01:19:04,074 --> 01:19:05,769
Bro! Look!
- What is your problem?

930
01:19:05,842 --> 01:19:07,810
I told you...just go.

931
01:19:31,267 --> 01:19:32,325
Sophie...
What're you doing here?

932
01:19:32,402 --> 01:19:33,266
What do you want?

933
01:19:33,837 --> 01:19:35,031
I don't want anything.

934
01:19:36,206 --> 01:19:37,935
Josh please, can you leave me alone?

935
01:19:38,742 --> 01:19:39,436
Please.

936
01:19:39,509 --> 01:19:41,067
Sophie, why are you like this?

937
01:19:41,211 --> 01:19:42,439
How else should I be?

938
01:19:45,482 --> 01:19:46,312
Josh, please!

939
01:19:46,416 --> 01:19:47,440
Please just go!

940
01:19:57,460 --> 01:19:58,392
Sophie...

941
01:19:58,795 --> 01:20:00,126
Do you remember Coach Ashraf?

942
01:20:03,133 --> 01:20:05,533
Coach...
Do you know where he is now?

943
01:20:05,969 --> 01:20:07,266
I do not know anything!

944
01:20:08,138 --> 01:20:09,002
Just...

945
01:20:22,852 --> 01:20:23,443
Sophie...

946
01:20:26,356 --> 01:20:27,152
Come...

947
01:20:34,164 --> 01:20:35,153
Come.

948
01:20:39,469 --> 01:20:40,401
Come.

949
01:21:01,157 --> 01:21:02,089
Sophie...

950
01:21:23,413 --> 01:21:26,007
I'll make a move then.

951
01:22:00,216 --> 01:22:01,205
Have you eaten dear?

952
01:22:07,757 --> 01:22:08,815
Have you read this?

953
01:22:08,992 --> 01:22:10,050
Maya Angelou.

954
01:22:12,028 --> 01:22:14,929
"I know why the caged birds sings"

955
01:22:15,765 --> 01:22:18,461
Is there a point in just reading this?

956
01:22:20,970 --> 01:22:23,461
No. No pointjust reading this.

957
01:22:44,861 --> 01:22:45,327
Bro!

958
01:22:45,795 --> 01:22:48,093
I studied in this school too,
I was a star here!

959
01:22:48,198 --> 01:22:48,892
I know.

960
01:22:49,065 --> 01:22:50,225
I met your "Daddy Mummy" friend.

961
01:22:50,333 --> 01:22:51,960
- When was that?
- I'll tell you.

962
01:22:53,236 --> 01:22:57,332
Where can I get the details of the
old teachers here?

963
01:22:57,440 --> 01:22:58,202
Come sir.

964
01:22:59,242 --> 01:23:00,072
Please sit.

965
01:23:14,123 --> 01:23:15,249
What are you doing here?

966
01:23:16,492 --> 01:23:22,226
I came to enquire about Ashraf‘s
sir's address or number.

967
01:23:23,199 --> 01:23:25,531
Oh, Coach...

968
01:23:27,103 --> 01:23:29,196
Let me check with the office.

969
01:23:30,006 --> 01:23:30,904
One moment.

970
01:24:09,812 --> 01:24:14,272
Coach Ashraf was the first person
to pass the ball to me.

971
01:24:14,884 --> 01:24:16,374
I was the one who passed it actually.

972
01:24:18,388 --> 01:24:22,085
But he asked me to.

973
01:24:24,360 --> 01:24:25,384
Thanks.

974
01:24:26,162 --> 01:24:27,129
Alright then.

975
01:24:32,568 --> 01:24:34,126
I won't talk to you
if things go on like this!

976
01:24:34,203 --> 01:24:36,501
It's not how you think it is.
She's an educated girl and...

977
01:24:36,839 --> 01:24:38,238
...I didn't even get through school.

978
01:24:38,775 --> 01:24:40,834
We aren't compatible.

979
01:24:40,977 --> 01:24:41,841
Then study now!

980
01:24:41,911 --> 01:24:44,141
So many folks finish
their education late.

981
01:24:44,514 --> 01:24:46,243
As for compatibility...

982
01:24:46,382 --> 01:24:49,476
look at Mamma and Dad.
They don't seem compatible at all.

983
01:24:49,852 --> 01:24:51,786
Dad is a poor mechanic...

984
01:24:51,955 --> 01:24:53,388
...always at work,
soaked in grease and dirt.

985
01:24:53,556 --> 01:24:56,548
Mamma is the hoity-toity type.

986
01:24:56,993 --> 01:24:59,291
They are forever fighting.

987
01:24:59,529 --> 01:25:02,327
But they cannot stay
apart for even a day.

988
01:25:02,799 --> 01:25:04,130
So much in love.

989
01:25:04,934 --> 01:25:09,234
Bro, people these days
search worldwide for a partner.

990
01:25:09,405 --> 01:25:10,929
Even on the internet.

991
01:25:11,007 --> 01:25:13,840
See how lucky you are!
The one for you is right here.

992
01:25:13,943 --> 01:25:15,843
Let's not talk about the internet...

993
01:25:16,379 --> 01:25:18,904
I stumbled upon your pen drive.

994
01:25:34,297 --> 01:25:37,323
I think you both should elope.

995
01:25:37,834 --> 01:25:38,858
What is wrong with you?

996
01:25:38,935 --> 01:25:40,402
No one elopes at our age.

997
01:25:40,503 --> 01:25:42,061
There's no age limit to eloping.

998
01:25:42,138 --> 01:25:44,470
You can elope at anytime
with anyone.

999
01:25:44,807 --> 01:25:47,002
Can I ask you something else?

1000
01:25:47,176 --> 01:25:47,904
What?

1001
01:25:48,511 --> 01:25:49,478
Bro, are you a virgin?

1002
01:25:57,153 --> 01:25:59,849
These aren't things
you should fret over.

1003
01:25:59,922 --> 01:26:04,859
For some it happens early,
For some a bit later.

1004
01:26:04,994 --> 01:26:07,519
These things should happen
naturally.

1005
01:26:07,864 --> 01:26:10,332
All that should happen,
will happen at the right time.

1006
01:26:10,566 --> 01:26:11,430
Chill.

1007
01:26:13,269 --> 01:26:15,134
- What is it?
- Move on!

1008
01:26:24,180 --> 01:26:26,114
You want to ask me something?

1009
01:26:26,816 --> 01:26:27,840
Yes you do, yes you do.

1010
01:26:27,917 --> 01:26:28,975
- No...not at all!
- That's not fair...

1011
01:26:29,052 --> 01:26:30,246
- I don't want to know anything
- Please! Please let me tell you.

1012
01:26:30,319 --> 01:26:32,947
I don't want to hear!
I don't want to hear!

1013
01:26:33,289 --> 01:26:35,587
All these years
I really missed you, Bro!

1014
01:26:37,293 --> 01:26:37,952
What?

1015
01:26:39,328 --> 01:26:40,317
What did you say?

1016
01:26:40,396 --> 01:26:41,385
Won't repeat.

1017
01:26:50,239 --> 01:26:51,137
One bun omlette!

1018
01:26:59,315 --> 01:27:07,347
(Sings along with the stereo)

1019
01:27:07,890 --> 01:27:10,859
Bro!
This is my college.

1020
01:27:11,260 --> 01:27:14,229
I had a gang of friends.
College life was so much fun.

1021
01:27:36,219 --> 01:27:37,208
What happened?

1022
01:27:39,355 --> 01:27:40,185
Nothing.

1023
01:27:47,363 --> 01:27:49,263
- Water?
- No.

1024
01:27:50,032 --> 01:27:51,363
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah

1025
01:27:54,504 --> 01:27:55,493
Hi Jenny!

1026
01:27:55,872 --> 01:27:57,237
-Jenny!
- Hi!

1027
01:27:58,508 --> 01:27:59,497
How're you feeling now?

1028
01:27:59,876 --> 01:28:00,467
I am fine.

1029
01:28:00,810 --> 01:28:02,801
She acts sick just
to see that cute doctor!

1030
01:28:02,945 --> 01:28:03,843
Yeah right.

1031
01:28:07,316 --> 01:28:08,476
Good morning!

1032
01:28:09,852 --> 01:28:10,978
Settle down please.

1033
01:28:14,557 --> 01:28:16,218
- Sabari Manisha,
- Yes ma'am!

1034
01:28:16,292 --> 01:28:17,350
- Akhil,
- Yes ma'am

1035
01:28:17,426 --> 01:28:19,087
- Lamya Aslam
- Yes ma'am

1036
01:28:19,195 --> 01:28:20,355
- Abru
- Yes ma'am

1037
01:28:20,429 --> 01:28:22,021
- Annie Varkey
- Yes ma'am

1038
01:28:22,198 --> 01:28:23,529
- Febin
- Yeah, present ma'am

1039
01:28:23,833 --> 01:28:24,993
Jennifer Thomas...

1040
01:28:25,168 --> 01:28:26,260
Present ma'am.

1041
01:28:26,402 --> 01:28:27,232
Hello Madam!

1042
01:28:27,336 --> 01:28:28,997
Are you back from your holiday?

1043
01:28:29,105 --> 01:28:31,471
If you are talented,
you might get an admission,

1044
01:28:31,574 --> 01:28:34,134
but to get a degree
you need attendance.

1045
01:28:34,377 --> 01:28:35,139
But ma'am...

1046
01:28:35,211 --> 01:28:37,475
- You know she was on...
It was not her... - Annie Varkey!

1047
01:28:37,813 --> 01:28:39,474
You don't have to speak for her.
Sit down please.

1048
01:28:39,782 --> 01:28:43,411
You're taking up seats that
should go to more talented students.

1049
01:28:43,986 --> 01:28:45,510
She knows about your health issue,
then what is her problem?

1050
01:28:45,821 --> 01:28:47,254
Don't announce it to everyone now.

1051
01:28:47,323 --> 01:28:48,517
Just shut up please.

1052
01:28:49,492 --> 01:28:51,153
Jenny! Jenny...

1053
01:28:51,961 --> 01:28:53,019
Sean is looking for you.

1054
01:28:53,095 --> 01:28:53,823
Sean?

1055
01:28:53,996 --> 01:28:56,487
The lead singer of
the Country Fellows - Sean!

1056
01:28:56,933 --> 01:28:58,093
Who's Jenny Thomas?

1057
01:28:58,768 --> 01:28:59,496
Yeah that's her.

1058
01:29:00,403 --> 01:29:02,200
Hey... Jenny.. hi!

1059
01:29:03,206 --> 01:29:04,104
Uh sit!

1060
01:29:04,774 --> 01:29:05,399
Hi!

1061
01:29:06,209 --> 01:29:08,939
Wow! Nice.

1062
01:29:09,946 --> 01:29:12,278
I loved your writing.

1063
01:29:12,782 --> 01:29:13,771
It's lovely.

1064
01:29:14,383 --> 01:29:15,042
Uh, this...

1065
01:29:15,251 --> 01:29:16,479
...came in the college magazine.

1066
01:29:16,786 --> 01:29:18,879
Especially this one.

1067
01:29:18,955 --> 01:29:20,513
I'd love to make this into a song.

1068
01:29:20,790 --> 01:29:21,779
What do you think?

1069
01:29:22,325 --> 01:29:24,350
- I think its a really...
- Its beautiful.

1070
01:29:24,860 --> 01:29:25,792
Its beautiful.

1071
01:29:26,128 --> 01:29:28,995
- This is written by you, right?
- Yes (mumbles).

1072
01:29:29,131 --> 01:29:30,928
Hey relax!
I just loved it.

1073
01:29:31,267 --> 01:29:33,360
So, if you are fine with it.
Rehearsal hall?

1074
01:29:34,136 --> 01:29:34,966
3 o'clock?

1075
01:29:35,104 --> 01:29:36,196
Okay? See you!

1076
01:29:40,076 --> 01:29:40,770
Bye .

1077
01:29:44,413 --> 01:29:45,141
Yes.

1078
01:29:47,416 --> 01:29:49,043
- He said 3 o'clock.
- Tomorrow?

1079
01:29:49,385 --> 01:29:50,784
- Today?
- No...

1080
01:29:51,153 --> 01:29:52,415
- Go ask
- Uh oh

1081
01:29:54,757 --> 01:29:56,019
- Bye.
- Okay then...

1082
01:29:56,092 --> 01:29:57,354
- Hey stop!
- Meet you tomorrow.

1083
01:29:57,460 --> 01:29:58,518
Krish... Krish leave it...

1084
01:29:58,794 --> 01:30:00,523
- Hey... stop.
- What is it?

1085
01:30:00,796 --> 01:30:02,423
In a band, everyone's equal.

1086
01:30:02,765 --> 01:30:05,757
You act as if you're the hero
& we are your sidekicks.

1087
01:30:06,002 --> 01:30:08,903
Get lost! That's what works there.

1088
01:30:09,438 --> 01:30:10,405
What did you want me to say...?

1089
01:30:10,473 --> 01:30:11,940
lam the lead singer...

1090
01:30:12,041 --> 01:30:12,871
He is the bassist...

1091
01:30:12,975 --> 01:30:14,340
She is the drummer,
You want me to give her details.

1092
01:30:14,410 --> 01:30:15,206
Yes, you should've.

1093
01:30:15,278 --> 01:30:16,939
That would be so uncool!

1094
01:30:17,013 --> 01:30:18,776
Uncool? Lead singer!

1095
01:30:18,848 --> 01:30:20,839
Do you even know
what the poem is about?

1096
01:30:21,050 --> 01:30:24,508
We're there to do all the
hard work & you take all the credit

1097
01:30:24,920 --> 01:30:26,785
- Hey!
- Isn't that how it always works?

1098
01:30:27,056 --> 01:30:28,284
I may not get the poem.

1099
01:30:28,791 --> 01:30:30,986
But that poet... will get her for sure.

1100
01:30:33,162 --> 01:30:34,857
Are you coming?

1101
01:30:35,131 --> 01:30:37,190
Forget it,
You know him.

1102
01:30:37,500 --> 01:30:38,762
Why does he have to be like this?

1103
01:30:42,138 --> 01:30:42,900
Krish!

1104
01:30:43,306 --> 01:30:44,364
Hey, wait!

1105
01:30:50,813 --> 01:30:51,404
Are you ok?

1106
01:30:58,754 --> 01:31:01,245
Lets ask here.

1107
01:31:02,758 --> 01:31:04,157
- You ask.
- No, you ask.

1108
01:31:04,427 --> 01:31:05,792
- Hi!
- Hi!

1109
01:31:06,462 --> 01:31:09,192
Sean had asked me to come at 3.

1110
01:31:10,032 --> 01:31:11,863
He'll surely not be here at 3.

1111
01:31:14,303 --> 01:31:15,827
But... he will show up.

1112
01:31:15,971 --> 01:31:17,495
Can we wait here till then?

1113
01:31:17,873 --> 01:31:18,396
Sure.

1114
01:31:18,941 --> 01:31:19,805
0k.

1115
01:31:20,376 --> 01:31:21,206
Thank you.

1116
01:31:21,844 --> 01:31:23,141
- Shall we start?
- Yup.

1117
01:31:38,928 --> 01:31:39,417
Hey...

1118
01:31:39,929 --> 01:31:40,953
That was sexy man.

1119
01:31:41,030 --> 01:31:41,826
Awesome!

1120
01:31:42,064 --> 01:31:42,860
Thank you.

1121
01:31:43,232 --> 01:31:45,257
But that's not a piece from this song.

1122
01:31:45,401 --> 01:31:46,026
No.

1123
01:31:46,168 --> 01:31:47,965
lwas just...

1124
01:31:48,170 --> 01:31:49,296
- You were just?
- I played it... for fun

1125
01:31:49,372 --> 01:31:50,862
- For fun.
- He played it for fun.

1126
01:31:52,775 --> 01:31:53,264
Okay.

1127
01:31:53,442 --> 01:31:56,172
Monty, let's go have
a cup of tea and start over.

1128
01:31:56,312 --> 01:31:57,870
That's a good idea.

1129
01:31:57,980 --> 01:31:58,878
Hey Krish!

1130
01:31:59,115 --> 01:31:59,877
How about a coffee?

1131
01:31:59,949 --> 01:32:01,280
No, I am good thank you!

1132
01:32:01,450 --> 01:32:02,849
Doesn't even want coffee now.

1133
01:32:05,755 --> 01:32:06,312
Hello...

1134
01:32:07,390 --> 01:32:08,357
I'll message you.

1135
01:32:10,025 --> 01:32:11,356
Hey, sit sit sit.

1136
01:32:12,328 --> 01:32:13,124
Krish.

1137
01:32:14,163 --> 01:32:15,357
Krishna actually.

1138
01:32:15,898 --> 01:32:16,489
Jenny...

1139
01:32:17,099 --> 01:32:17,758
Annie.

1140
01:32:17,867 --> 01:32:18,765
Krish.

1141
01:32:19,335 --> 01:32:21,360
- A call, sorry, two minutes.
- Yeah yeah ok.

1142
01:32:22,938 --> 01:32:23,768
Just...

1143
01:32:28,010 --> 01:32:29,409
Sean would be here soon right?

1144
01:32:29,512 --> 01:32:30,536
Yeah.

1145
01:32:33,115 --> 01:32:34,878
- Jenny's...
- Sean is the bands lead singer right?

1146
01:32:34,950 --> 01:32:36,941
Yeah, mostly he is the one who sings.

1147
01:32:37,353 --> 01:32:39,253
He's a superb singer right?
- Yeah, he is not bad.

1148
01:32:43,492 --> 01:32:45,858
I really like your writing.

1149
01:32:45,995 --> 01:32:47,019
Thank you.

1150
01:32:47,229 --> 01:32:49,390
Couldn't say that to you yesterday.

1151
01:32:49,899 --> 01:32:51,457
He asked me to come at 3.

1152
01:32:51,734 --> 01:32:53,133
He never comes on time.

1153
01:32:53,269 --> 01:32:53,894
Oh.

1154
01:32:54,470 --> 01:32:57,871
I found your poem and
showed it to everyone.

1155
01:32:57,973 --> 01:33:00,066
I think it will make a really nice song.

1156
01:33:00,743 --> 01:33:01,402
Thank you.

1157
01:33:02,278 --> 01:33:04,212
Were you not in class for a few days?

1158
01:33:05,047 --> 01:33:09,211
- Oh, I was uh... travelling.
- Oh, ok.

1159
01:33:09,351 --> 01:33:10,511
I had come searching for you
a few times.

1160
01:33:10,786 --> 01:33:12,447
Hey! Look, who is here! Wow.

1161
01:33:12,788 --> 01:33:14,415
So good to see you, Jenny.

1162
01:33:14,523 --> 01:33:15,922
Sit, Sit. Sit down.

1163
01:33:18,093 --> 01:33:20,357
- Have you been waiting for long?
- No, not at all.

1164
01:33:21,096 --> 01:33:22,256
This is my friend, Annie...

1165
01:33:22,331 --> 01:33:23,764
Oh hi hi!

1166
01:33:23,966 --> 01:33:24,933
You know what?

1167
01:33:25,201 --> 01:33:27,499
I am going to make a beautiful
song of your poem.

1168
01:33:29,305 --> 01:33:30,966
Will I have to change any words?

1169
01:33:31,040 --> 01:33:32,098
Hey chill.

1170
01:33:32,374 --> 01:33:33,500
I am there.
Relax.

1171
01:33:33,876 --> 01:33:34,968
You don't have to worry about all that.

1172
01:33:35,044 --> 01:33:35,976
Sean, shall we start?

1173
01:33:37,780 --> 01:33:39,941
I've brought the lyrics

1174
01:33:40,449 --> 01:33:41,313
That is so cool.

1175
01:33:41,417 --> 01:33:42,509
Ok, so...

1176
01:33:42,785 --> 01:33:43,945
...you guys relax here.

1177
01:33:44,053 --> 01:33:45,816
And watch me rocking the song!

1178
01:33:45,888 --> 01:33:47,913
Ok guys! So lets do this...

1179
01:34:18,120 --> 01:34:21,920
Hey wandering, whistling wind,
push open the doors within.

1180
01:34:21,991 --> 01:34:24,960
So that we may glide & ﬂy.

1181
01:34:25,160 --> 01:34:29,028
This moonshine, sunlight & mist,
the sunset reds, ﬂowers and hills

1182
01:34:29,098 --> 01:34:32,067
Come lets run together to go see them.

1183
01:34:32,268 --> 01:34:35,863
Oh see how moments pass,
Oh see how time runs.

1184
01:34:35,971 --> 01:34:39,168
Like water slipping
through our ﬁngers.

1185
01:34:39,241 --> 01:34:42,870
Oh see how moments pass,
Oh see how time runs.

1186
01:34:42,945 --> 01:34:46,073
Like water slipping
through our ﬁngers.

1187
01:34:46,115 --> 01:34:54,955
Here we ﬂy, with our tiny wings,
lets rise, let's kiss life.

1188
01:34:55,057 --> 01:35:03,157
Here we ﬂy... breaking down many
walls, let's swim across oceans.

1189
01:35:39,935 --> 01:35:46,067
The ﬂowers sway, the ﬂowers wilt,
like the smile of time

1190
01:35:46,976 --> 01:35:53,814
Before our eyes, sway some dreams,
would you come sway with me?

1191
01:35:54,049 --> 01:35:57,348
Singing silences, humming rhythms

1192
01:35:57,419 --> 01:36:00,946
Shall we stand together?

1193
01:36:01,123 --> 01:36:07,858
Like the wind blowing everywhere,
dreams are in the air.

1194
01:36:08,430 --> 01:36:17,964
No shut doors,
No closed locks, no stop to the song.

1195
01:36:18,207 --> 01:36:21,335
Let's climb through
these forests & plains.

1196
01:36:21,477 --> 01:36:30,215
Here we ﬂy, with our tiny wings,
lets rise, let's kiss life.

1197
01:36:30,319 --> 01:36:39,057
Here we ﬂy... breaking down many
walls, let's swim across oceans.

1198
01:36:53,876 --> 01:36:57,209
Hey wind as you pass
through blue cloud groves,

1199
01:36:57,246 --> 01:37:00,773
don't you hear the
music of the morning?

1200
01:37:00,949 --> 01:37:07,252
As you glide past the rainbow, don't
you see the magical ﬂoral wave?

1201
01:37:08,457 --> 01:37:11,984
Let's not sit in pain.

1202
01:37:12,194 --> 01:37:18,099
let's not recall the past,
Let's not get stuck in fear.

1203
01:37:18,300 --> 01:37:21,326
Let's ﬂy over these skies!

1204
01:37:21,537 --> 01:37:30,241
Here we ﬂy, with our tiny
wings lets rise, let's kiss life

1205
01:37:30,379 --> 01:37:39,048
Here we ﬂy, breaking down
many walls, let's swim across oceans

1206
01:37:39,188 --> 01:37:47,892
Here we ﬂy,with our tiny
wings lets rise, let's kiss life.

1207
01:37:48,130 --> 01:37:57,061
Here we ﬂy, breaking down many
walls, let's swim across oceans.

1208
01:38:20,496 --> 01:38:22,396
Nothing new to say.

1209
01:38:22,931 --> 01:38:25,229
No strain allowed.
Better be careful ok?

1210
01:38:26,068 --> 01:38:27,194
Will you have an apple?

1211
01:38:28,203 --> 01:38:28,965
Yes.

1212
01:38:30,272 --> 01:38:31,261
Did you go to class today?

1213
01:38:31,340 --> 01:38:32,068
Yes.

1214
01:38:32,141 --> 01:38:33,039
Damn!

1215
01:38:33,809 --> 01:38:35,504
Why should I not go
to class if you're sick?

1216
01:38:35,577 --> 01:38:37,340
Yeah, yeah have fun.

1217
01:38:37,546 --> 01:38:39,514
You are here because
of the fun you had that day.

1218
01:38:39,782 --> 01:38:41,807
Tell the mestri to return
the jeep today itself...

1219
01:38:42,117 --> 01:38:42,481
Okay.

1220
01:38:44,520 --> 01:38:45,817
- Hi Jenny!
- Hi guys.

1221
01:38:46,288 --> 01:38:47,186
Hi!

1222
01:38:49,158 --> 01:38:49,817
Hi!

1223
01:38:51,493 --> 01:38:54,462
Mamma, Dad, these are my friends.

1224
01:38:54,530 --> 01:38:56,259
Sorry seniors...

1225
01:38:56,532 --> 01:38:59,399
Gigi, Monty, Arjun, Sean,

1226
01:38:59,535 --> 01:39:01,196
and Krishna.

1227
01:39:01,270 --> 01:39:03,795
- Oh, the kids from the band.
- Yes.

1228
01:39:03,872 --> 01:39:05,169
Aunty... actually,

1229
01:39:05,240 --> 01:39:07,401
Jenny became unwell because of us.

1230
01:39:08,277 --> 01:39:09,266
How do you feel now?

1231
01:39:09,344 --> 01:39:10,538
I am perfectly fine.

1232
01:39:10,946 --> 01:39:12,811
This is just hospital procedure.

1233
01:39:13,048 --> 01:39:14,310
We're really sorry Jenny.

1234
01:39:14,416 --> 01:39:17,283
None of us knew about your condition.

1235
01:39:18,554 --> 01:39:22,149
Yesterday,
Badri ma'am also fired all of us.

1236
01:39:24,092 --> 01:39:25,525
That is when we got to know.

1237
01:39:26,128 --> 01:39:29,564
If we had known, we would
not have troubled you like this.

1238
01:39:29,832 --> 01:39:32,096
No, no, no...
I had a great time.

1239
01:39:32,334 --> 01:39:34,427
The song was also really nice.

1240
01:39:36,071 --> 01:39:37,038
Thanks to you.

1241
01:39:37,172 --> 01:39:38,503
Jenny, you please take rest okay!

1242
01:39:38,774 --> 01:39:39,468
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1243
01:39:39,808 --> 01:39:40,502
Take good care!

1244
01:39:40,776 --> 01:39:41,401
Bye .

1245
01:39:42,177 --> 01:39:43,041
Bye .

1246
01:39:44,079 --> 01:39:44,875
Bye .

1247
01:39:45,347 --> 01:39:46,336
Take care.

1248
01:39:48,483 --> 01:39:49,882
Bye, see you in college.

1249
01:39:54,489 --> 01:39:56,047
They are good kids.

1250
01:39:57,159 --> 01:39:58,456
This time it is because of them

1251
01:40:16,812 --> 01:40:23,308
You did turn to look even once that day,
I knew then, you would never call me again.

1252
01:40:31,226 --> 01:40:34,889
Brownie!
Mamma's appam & stew!

1253
01:40:39,902 --> 01:40:41,301
Found this in your room.

1254
01:40:45,340 --> 01:40:46,830
Did you read my diary?

1255
01:40:49,044 --> 01:40:50,375
Did you read my diary?

1256
01:40:51,346 --> 01:40:53,007
I have better things to do!

1257
01:40:57,119 --> 01:41:00,816
Peeping into others diaries
and pen drives is bad manners.

1258
01:41:03,959 --> 01:41:05,256
Oh Mamma!

1259
01:41:05,360 --> 01:41:06,759
She is too good!

1260
01:41:06,862 --> 01:41:08,454
Can you ask for puttu & kadala tomorrow?

1261
01:41:09,364 --> 01:41:10,228
Do you want some?

1262
01:41:12,100 --> 01:41:12,498
Bro!

1263
01:41:13,268 --> 01:41:15,236
This is my college bus.

1264
01:41:15,871 --> 01:41:18,305
That is Annie!
We used to travel together.

1265
01:41:18,407 --> 01:41:19,965
Bro, can you please go with it?

1266
01:41:29,418 --> 01:41:30,180
Bro,

1267
01:41:30,919 --> 01:41:32,386
Can you do something for me?

1268
01:41:35,490 --> 01:41:37,458
Who is Krish?

1269
01:41:37,793 --> 01:41:38,487
Krishna...

1270
01:41:38,927 --> 01:41:39,484
Krishna!

1271
01:41:42,898 --> 01:41:45,833
I am Jenny's brother.

1272
01:41:47,402 --> 01:41:49,302
This belonged to Jenny.

1273
01:42:07,489 --> 01:42:10,356
That's where we use
to practice football.

1274
01:42:17,366 --> 01:42:18,458
Do you know where this address is?

1275
01:42:18,500 --> 01:42:20,400
Take the next right,
it's the first alley.

1276
01:42:20,469 --> 01:42:23,029
People will start getting here soon.

1277
01:42:23,138 --> 01:42:24,162
Hurry up, won't you!

1278
01:42:24,406 --> 01:42:27,239
Everyone has chores to do.
You want me to leave without finishing?

1279
01:42:27,309 --> 01:42:30,005
How long are you going to take?

1280
01:42:30,145 --> 01:42:31,544
Wait for sometime.

1281
01:42:31,813 --> 01:42:34,407
I have been waiting since such a long time.
- You keep saying wait. Till when...

1282
01:42:34,483 --> 01:42:35,814
Excuse me
Sister...

1283
01:42:36,284 --> 01:42:37,376
This address...

1284
01:42:37,452 --> 01:42:38,146
No idea!

1285
01:42:43,258 --> 01:42:44,452
Yeah,
I came to the college yesterday.

1286
01:42:44,793 --> 01:42:46,420
Yeah,
I was right in front of the gate.

1287
01:42:46,728 --> 01:42:49,458
Your friend told me that
you were very busy studying.

1288
01:42:49,965 --> 01:42:51,091
What else could I do?

1289
01:42:51,166 --> 01:42:52,190
I waited for a while.

1290
01:42:52,768 --> 01:42:54,030
Ask your friend.

1291
01:42:55,303 --> 01:42:55,997
Really...

1292
01:42:56,238 --> 01:42:57,500
You don't believe me?

1293
01:42:58,040 --> 01:42:58,972
That's what I said.

1294
01:42:59,207 --> 01:43:00,333
I called early in the morning.

1295
01:43:00,475 --> 01:43:01,464
There was no range.

1296
01:43:01,510 --> 01:43:02,408
Rafi!

1297
01:43:02,811 --> 01:43:04,438
Yeah, yeah.
No No!

1298
01:43:05,914 --> 01:43:07,279
Will you come tomorrow?

1299
01:43:07,482 --> 01:43:08,346
Yes, ok ok.

1300
01:43:08,450 --> 01:43:09,474
We'll try to meet tomorrow.

1301
01:43:10,185 --> 01:43:11,345
lam telling you I will!

1302
01:43:12,487 --> 01:43:14,318
At what time?
Will you call tonight?

1303
01:43:14,456 --> 01:43:16,754
- I don't want it.
- Hang on, will just call you back.

1304
01:43:17,159 --> 01:43:18,888
Gruel... I don't want it!

1305
01:43:19,261 --> 01:43:20,853
So then what?
you want Biryani?

1306
01:43:20,996 --> 01:43:24,363
Just have what you are getting.
No wonder everyone left you!

1307
01:43:24,499 --> 01:43:25,932
Your attitude is the problem.

1308
01:43:26,001 --> 01:43:27,332
What is it?
I must not speak on the phone?

1309
01:43:27,436 --> 01:43:28,869
Must I not do any of my work?

1310
01:43:29,004 --> 01:43:30,494
What a pain this man is!

1311
01:43:34,409 --> 01:43:37,071
- What do you want?
- Who is that inside?

1312
01:43:37,279 --> 01:43:38,473
An old cripple...

1313
01:43:38,980 --> 01:43:41,813
- Rafi! Who is there?
- Can I see him?

1314
01:43:41,983 --> 01:43:42,950
Where're you from?

1315
01:43:43,485 --> 01:43:44,383
Rafi!

1316
01:43:46,121 --> 01:43:47,850
Hey! He won't like it.

1317
01:43:49,791 --> 01:43:50,553
Hello!

1318
01:43:51,259 --> 01:43:55,525
I am sorry love...
I got a bit busy here.

1319
01:43:57,265 --> 01:43:58,232
Coach...

1320
01:44:05,040 --> 01:44:06,132
It's Josh.

1321
01:44:07,542 --> 01:44:08,907
Joshua Thomas.

1322
01:44:26,928 --> 01:44:28,486
I didn't know...

1323
01:44:48,283 --> 01:44:49,045
Yeah ok.

1324
01:44:54,556 --> 01:44:55,420
Hello!

1325
01:44:57,559 --> 01:44:58,526
Josh...

1326
01:45:12,407 --> 01:45:14,967
Josh, you have to
fill out the details here.

1327
01:45:15,210 --> 01:45:17,508
I'll take care of him.

1328
01:45:18,346 --> 01:45:20,837
Coach, just going to
be here for a little bit

1329
01:45:23,885 --> 01:45:25,011
House no. 17

1330
01:45:25,921 --> 01:45:27,821
Not 2nd street, 3rd street...

1331
01:45:33,562 --> 01:45:35,894
This is the address of
the place he was living at.

1332
01:45:35,964 --> 01:45:37,124
It is not his own house.

1333
01:45:44,072 --> 01:45:45,801
Coach, do you recognize Sophie?

1334
01:45:46,441 --> 01:45:50,775
She was the only girl who
used to come for football practice...

1335
01:45:51,079 --> 01:45:52,808
Do you remember me, sir?

1336
01:45:53,014 --> 01:45:54,379
She's a teacher there now.

1337
01:46:20,842 --> 01:46:21,570
Bro!

1338
01:46:21,910 --> 01:46:25,368
Is your love & care only
for the people at school?

1339
01:46:25,447 --> 01:46:26,209
What do you mean?

1340
01:46:26,281 --> 01:46:29,444
For Coach Ashraf and Sophie?

1341
01:46:29,851 --> 01:46:30,818
What are you trying to say?

1342
01:46:30,885 --> 01:46:34,912
From all that love & care you show to
them, you could save for those at home.

1343
01:46:35,423 --> 01:46:39,519
So, all I have done isn't
enough for the folks at home?

1344
01:46:41,963 --> 01:46:44,864
Bro,
I have a theory.

1345
01:46:45,367 --> 01:46:48,825
Everything that people do is for
two reasons.

1346
01:46:49,871 --> 01:46:52,237
Either its duty,
or its love.

1347
01:46:53,008 --> 01:46:55,033
Take washing this van for example.

1348
01:46:55,377 --> 01:46:58,437
If you are washing it
because you have to, its duty.

1349
01:46:58,913 --> 01:47:02,781
But, if you are washing the van
because you care for it, its love.

1350
01:47:02,917 --> 01:47:06,182
Anything done with love
is simple.

1351
01:47:07,222 --> 01:47:10,988
But duty is complicated.

1352
01:47:11,893 --> 01:47:17,388
Whatever you did for us
all this while was that duty or...?

1353
01:47:29,811 --> 01:47:31,005
ls repair uncle home?

1354
01:47:33,848 --> 01:47:35,076
Give it to me.
I'll take it to him.

1355
01:47:35,150 --> 01:47:37,243
No no... can you call him?

1356
01:47:38,853 --> 01:47:39,478
Dad?

1357
01:47:39,788 --> 01:47:41,983
He is in the attic...
He won't hear you from here.

1358
01:47:42,891 --> 01:47:43,789
Come.

1359
01:47:48,496 --> 01:47:50,760
He's upstairs. Go ahead.

1360
01:47:52,901 --> 01:47:54,232
He is always up there...

1361
01:47:54,469 --> 01:47:56,960
Working on some old toy of yours.

1362
01:49:21,222 --> 01:49:23,122
There's a switch there.

1363
01:50:29,257 --> 01:50:30,554
Hello, Ashraf Sir!

1364
01:50:35,830 --> 01:50:36,558
Coach!

1365
01:50:38,500 --> 01:50:39,762
How are you?

1366
01:50:40,969 --> 01:50:42,197
So good to see you!

1367
01:50:42,303 --> 01:50:44,271
Our old memories right here!

1368
01:50:59,053 --> 01:51:00,884
Aby! Offside, offside.

1369
01:51:04,359 --> 01:51:06,020
Don't you play anymore?

1370
01:51:09,397 --> 01:51:10,261
No.

1371
01:51:12,467 --> 01:51:13,934
Ashwin, go!

1372
01:51:28,449 --> 01:51:29,916
Here... you keep it.

1373
01:51:35,356 --> 01:51:38,348
These boys should
not play without shoes.

1374
01:51:48,303 --> 01:51:50,999
Maybe they don't have shoes.

1375
01:51:52,774 --> 01:51:53,399
Bro!

1376
01:51:55,043 --> 01:51:56,772
Isn't there a way to solve that, Bro?

1377
01:52:02,250 --> 01:52:03,217
Thanks brother!

1378
01:52:03,952 --> 01:52:07,217
"And over the flame she held
the same long and tremulous hands"

1379
01:52:07,422 --> 01:52:08,446
"that she had been warming"

1380
01:52:08,790 --> 01:52:10,189
"before sitting down at the mirror."

1381
01:52:10,425 --> 01:52:11,483
"And she said"

1382
01:52:11,826 --> 01:52:14,818
"You don't feel the cold?
And he said to her, sometimes!"

1383
01:52:15,063 --> 01:52:17,122
None of these makes sense to me.

1384
01:52:17,865 --> 01:52:19,856
It's a good book, read it sometime.

1385
01:52:34,916 --> 01:52:36,315
Joe, go bring her!

1386
01:52:38,052 --> 01:52:38,916
Sophie!

1387
01:52:39,921 --> 01:52:40,853
Joe! Joe...

1388
01:52:40,955 --> 01:52:41,785
Come.

1389
01:52:41,990 --> 01:52:43,184
Come.

1390
01:52:44,025 --> 01:52:45,287
Why're you doing this?

1391
01:52:45,960 --> 01:52:47,120
Don't you know me?

1392
01:52:50,498 --> 01:52:51,157
What?

1393
01:52:51,366 --> 01:52:52,094
Joe?

1394
01:52:52,300 --> 01:52:55,030
Arrogance over the
little money you earned abroad!

1395
01:52:55,470 --> 01:52:57,438
I better not see you around again!

1396
01:53:47,288 --> 01:53:48,846
Come on, Bro.
Let's go!

1397
01:53:52,193 --> 01:53:54,024
Bro!
What're you doing?

1398
01:53:54,295 --> 01:53:56,525
Let's go to her house.
Bro!

1399
01:53:57,198 --> 01:53:58,165
To do what?

1400
01:53:58,833 --> 01:53:59,197
What?

1401
01:53:59,267 --> 01:54:01,326
They're her family Jenny.

1402
01:54:01,836 --> 01:54:04,202
People who drag her
away like that are family?

1403
01:54:08,142 --> 01:54:10,235
Didn't you feel like doing
anything when you saw that?

1404
01:54:11,279 --> 01:54:14,476
Don't you have a problem with that?

1405
01:54:18,252 --> 01:54:20,379
Won't you stand up at least for her?

1406
01:54:31,232 --> 01:54:35,134
You know well what
it is like to be alone.

1407
01:54:36,270 --> 01:54:41,401
When bad things happened then,
there was no one to stand up for you.

1408
01:54:43,211 --> 01:54:45,202
Today, Sophie is in that state.

1409
01:54:45,813 --> 01:54:48,247
You must go, Bro. You must.

1410
01:55:08,436 --> 01:55:09,994
She cannot live here anymore.

1411
01:55:10,471 --> 01:55:11,961
Don't worry about the divorce.

1412
01:55:12,106 --> 01:55:14,574
Let's go talk to them & send
her back to her husbands place.

1413
01:55:14,842 --> 01:55:17,037
Christy, think before you talk.

1414
01:55:17,278 --> 01:55:20,145
Didn't she leave that house because
of the torture they put her through?

1415
01:55:20,214 --> 01:55:21,476
Ousepachan!
What're you saying?

1416
01:55:21,549 --> 01:55:24,074
We know how to take care
of the women in our house.

1417
01:55:24,152 --> 01:55:25,847
And they live accordingly.

1418
01:55:26,020 --> 01:55:27,351
But your daughter is not like that.

1419
01:55:27,455 --> 01:55:28,854
How embarrassing!

1420
01:55:29,123 --> 01:55:30,147
Isn't he that mechanic's son?

1421
01:55:30,224 --> 01:55:32,089
Yes! See?

1422
01:55:32,493 --> 01:55:34,188
He has the nerve to walk into this
house!

1423
01:55:34,262 --> 01:55:36,560
Where do you think you are going?

1424
01:55:38,800 --> 01:55:40,427
I would like to explain...

1425
01:55:41,369 --> 01:55:43,394
Are you stupid or are
you trying to be brave?

1426
01:55:43,504 --> 01:55:45,870
Didnt we tell you to stay away?

1427
01:55:45,973 --> 01:55:47,133
What do you have to say?

1428
01:55:50,378 --> 01:55:52,175
Sophie has not done anything wrong.

1429
01:55:52,880 --> 01:55:56,873
There is nothing
going on like you think.

1430
01:55:57,885 --> 01:55:59,284
Then why are you here?

1431
01:55:59,887 --> 01:56:01,445
He must have come to take her with him.

1432
01:56:05,193 --> 01:56:06,455
If Sophie would come...

1433
01:56:07,361 --> 01:56:08,385
If she'd come...?

1434
01:56:12,133 --> 01:56:13,157
I'll take her.

1435
01:56:13,434 --> 01:56:15,834
How dare you come
into this house and...

1436
01:56:16,170 --> 01:56:18,570
Christy, Christy please! Christy stop!

1437
01:56:22,410 --> 01:56:23,934
I don't want to go with him.

1438
01:56:37,158 --> 01:56:38,420
High hopes he had!

1439
01:56:40,061 --> 01:56:41,050
Didn't you hear that?

1440
01:56:41,362 --> 01:56:42,329
Get lost.

1441
01:56:46,500 --> 01:56:47,364
Go!

1442
01:57:53,234 --> 01:57:55,395
Bro, what happened?

1443
01:57:57,505 --> 01:57:58,767
Bro, please.

1444
01:57:59,540 --> 01:58:01,303
No! Do I still have to listen to you?

1445
01:59:19,220 --> 01:59:20,517
lsnt she the girl from Meleparambu?

1446
01:59:20,855 --> 01:59:21,446
Yes.

1447
01:59:21,956 --> 01:59:22,513
Sophie...

1448
01:59:22,790 --> 01:59:23,779
Jesus!

1449
01:59:24,025 --> 01:59:25,515
If someone comes to know...

1450
01:59:30,998 --> 01:59:31,794
Kochuthresi here.

1451
01:59:31,932 --> 01:59:33,297
Just let them know.

1452
01:59:34,268 --> 01:59:35,200
Yeah, tell her too.

1453
01:59:35,269 --> 01:59:36,258
Okay okay.

1454
01:59:58,926 --> 02:00:01,019
When her family comes to know,
this is going to blow up.

1455
02:00:01,095 --> 02:00:02,062
What can one say!

1456
02:00:02,296 --> 02:00:04,764
I told you there
was something going on.

1457
02:00:04,965 --> 02:00:07,297
God knows what is
going to happen now.

1458
02:00:10,304 --> 02:00:13,137
No, thank you.
- Father, we have waited till tea time.

1459
02:00:13,474 --> 02:00:15,874
Will I have to prepare
Dinner for everyone as well?

1460
02:00:25,352 --> 02:00:26,979
Father... if you could...

1461
02:00:27,154 --> 02:00:27,950
Me?

1462
02:00:28,355 --> 02:00:29,947
Who else?

1463
02:00:30,791 --> 02:00:31,780
Is that necessary?

1464
02:00:32,393 --> 02:00:33,257
Yes.

1465
02:00:34,862 --> 02:00:35,851
Then...

1466
02:00:44,038 --> 02:00:44,970
Joshua...

1467
02:00:48,075 --> 02:00:49,007
My dear children...

1468
02:00:51,011 --> 02:00:53,775
In the name of the lord, please
open the door.

1469
02:00:54,782 --> 02:00:56,215
This is Fr. Immanuel.

1470
02:00:57,952 --> 02:01:00,113
Please open the door.
Many people have gathered here.

1471
02:01:00,387 --> 02:01:01,251
Where is Joshua?

1472
02:01:01,789 --> 02:01:03,279
- He's inside.
- Call him.

1473
02:01:03,791 --> 02:01:05,782
- Ssh... Sophie is with him.
- Sophie?

1474
02:01:08,529 --> 02:01:09,518
Sophie!

1475
02:01:10,064 --> 02:01:10,962
Open the door.

1476
02:01:11,132 --> 02:01:12,292
Break it down!

1477
02:01:12,833 --> 02:01:15,131
Not that way.
Let me show you.

1478
02:01:16,270 --> 02:01:18,329
- See?
- Sophie!

1479
02:01:54,241 --> 02:01:56,004
Christy! What is this?

1480
02:01:56,911 --> 02:01:58,105
Where is your son?

1481
02:01:59,246 --> 02:02:00,372
Get out of here!

1482
02:02:00,981 --> 02:02:01,811
I said GET OUT!!

1483
02:02:01,916 --> 02:02:02,883
Didn't you hear that?

1484
02:02:02,950 --> 02:02:05,817
Get the hell out!
How dare you come here and...

1485
02:02:07,955 --> 02:02:09,786
My son has left with his girl!

1486
02:02:09,823 --> 02:02:10,448
His girl?

1487
02:02:10,758 --> 02:02:11,315
Yes.

1488
02:02:11,825 --> 02:02:13,452
Go mind your own business!

1489
02:02:13,761 --> 02:02:15,456
- This won't end here.
- We'll see!

1490
02:02:55,769 --> 02:02:56,394
Sorry!

1491
02:03:15,923 --> 02:03:17,447
It is good that you've just eloped.

1492
02:03:17,791 --> 02:03:18,951
But I'm really hungry.

1493
02:03:50,858 --> 02:03:52,325
Rainbow,

1494
02:03:53,560 --> 02:03:55,960
wont you look this way

1495
02:03:56,563 --> 02:04:01,899
Through the glass of dense mist

1496
02:04:02,436 --> 02:04:07,965
Wont you gently lean,

1497
02:04:08,309 --> 02:04:13,303
on the branch laden with memories

1498
02:04:14,815 --> 02:04:20,014
Seeking
through the glances

1499
02:04:20,587 --> 02:04:25,581
Hiding
through the pain

1500
02:04:26,493 --> 02:04:31,260
Once again,
wont you come along?

1501
02:04:31,865 --> 02:04:34,026
Rainbow,

1502
02:04:34,601 --> 02:04:37,035
wont you look this way

1503
02:04:37,571 --> 02:04:43,305
Through the glass of dense mist

1504
02:05:10,070 --> 02:05:20,913
Even unexpected
drops of dew

1505
02:05:21,382 --> 02:05:26,979
That fall through,
await you

1506
02:05:27,421 --> 02:05:32,984
Housed in deep feeling,

1507
02:05:33,293 --> 02:05:39,960
In the woods ofmy mind.
Was I awaiting you all the while?

1508
02:05:41,969 --> 02:05:44,028
Rainbow,

1509
02:05:44,338 --> 02:05:47,330
wont you look this wajﬂ.

1510
02:05:47,975 --> 02:05:53,242
Through the glass of dense mist

1511
02:05:59,820 --> 02:06:00,548
Come down

1512
02:06:01,388 --> 02:06:02,412
How was it?

1513
02:06:06,860 --> 02:06:08,088
Josh, come.

1514
02:06:08,262 --> 02:06:09,092
Yes.

1515
02:06:11,832 --> 02:06:13,094
It's so beautiful.

1516
02:06:13,167 --> 02:06:14,532
Yes, very beautiful.

1517
02:06:20,307 --> 02:06:31,115
The dense winter fog

1518
02:06:31,585 --> 02:06:43,258
Make the valleys disappear

1519
02:06:43,497 --> 02:06:50,335
In the same bare soil

1520
02:06:52,272 --> 02:06:55,207
Rainbow,

1521
02:06:55,275 --> 02:06:58,108
wont you look this wajﬂ.

1522
02:06:58,178 --> 02:07:04,014
Through the glass of dense mist

1523
02:07:04,551 --> 02:07:10,285
Seeking through the glances

1524
02:07:10,424 --> 02:07:15,259
Once again,
wont you come along?

1525
02:07:17,798 --> 02:07:19,425
It is my mother's death anniversary.

1526
02:07:33,847 --> 02:07:35,041
I'll wait outside.

1527
02:07:44,091 --> 02:07:45,820
This is for Jenny.

1528
02:07:46,460 --> 02:07:48,052
Where is her grave?

1529
02:07:53,066 --> 02:07:53,862
Let's go.

1530
02:08:17,224 --> 02:08:19,488
Yes.
This is my number.

1531
02:08:20,827 --> 02:08:21,987
Okay, Dad.

1532
02:08:26,900 --> 02:08:28,834
Josh, don't you want
to call your parents?

1533
02:08:39,079 --> 02:08:40,011
Call.

1534
02:08:44,885 --> 02:08:45,852
Call!

1535
02:08:50,524 --> 02:08:51,149
Hello!

1536
02:08:51,291 --> 02:08:53,418
Kids! Ssh...

1537
02:08:53,527 --> 02:08:55,392
Hello, who is it?
I can't hear a thing.

1538
02:08:56,496 --> 02:08:57,224
Hello!

1539
02:08:57,297 --> 02:08:58,161
It's me... Joshua.

1540
02:08:58,198 --> 02:09:00,166
Hey! Yoshe!

1541
02:09:00,334 --> 02:09:01,301
Where're you?

1542
02:09:01,368 --> 02:09:05,236
We're a bit far away from town.
No, there is no problem.

1543
02:09:06,139 --> 02:09:07,197
And there?

1544
02:09:07,341 --> 02:09:09,172
Everything is okay here too.
Everyone is fine.

1545
02:09:09,242 --> 02:09:10,402
What's that noise?

1546
02:09:10,944 --> 02:09:13,538
These kids are a loud bunch.

1547
02:09:13,947 --> 02:09:15,972
If there're three one day,
there'd be six the next!

1548
02:09:16,049 --> 02:09:17,846
The rail town we made?

1549
02:09:17,918 --> 02:09:20,409
They come here to see
it and drive your mamma crazy.

1550
02:09:20,520 --> 02:09:21,782
Is she around?

1551
02:09:22,222 --> 02:09:24,122
Yes, she is.
I will give her the phone.

1552
02:09:25,158 --> 02:09:25,954
Hello!

1553
02:09:26,793 --> 02:09:27,487
Joshua!

1554
02:09:27,894 --> 02:09:28,485
Mamma...

1555
02:09:28,895 --> 02:09:31,056
Where are you? Where are you staying?

1556
02:09:34,234 --> 02:09:35,565
ls Sophie with you?

1557
02:09:36,003 --> 02:09:37,027
Sophie...

1558
02:09:37,537 --> 02:09:39,732
She is...
I will give her the phone

1559
02:09:42,175 --> 02:09:43,107
Its mamma.

1560
02:09:44,745 --> 02:09:45,404
Hello mamma!

1561
02:09:45,512 --> 02:09:46,274
Hello!

1562
02:09:46,513 --> 02:09:48,140
- Sophie!
- Yes.

1563
02:09:48,181 --> 02:09:49,170
Are you both well?

1564
02:09:49,216 --> 02:09:50,979
Yeah, everything is fine.

1565
02:09:55,022 --> 02:09:58,048
In a few days...

1566
02:10:01,061 --> 02:10:02,961
Yeah, Brownie is with us.

1567
02:10:04,765 --> 02:10:05,459
Bro,

1568
02:10:06,066 --> 02:10:07,226
Can I ask you something?

1569
02:10:07,401 --> 02:10:08,231
Yes.

1570
02:10:09,536 --> 02:10:11,299
Have they forgotten me?

1571
02:10:16,209 --> 02:10:19,235
Even I used to feel that way before.

1572
02:10:21,348 --> 02:10:22,508
But it's not like that.

1573
02:10:23,417 --> 02:10:25,248
Our house is filled with kids now.

1574
02:10:27,287 --> 02:10:30,222
In all of them, Dad and Mamma...

1575
02:10:31,458 --> 02:10:32,356
...see US.

1576
02:10:41,768 --> 02:10:42,393
Bye .

1577
02:10:47,874 --> 02:10:49,034
Thank you...

1578
02:10:51,445 --> 02:10:52,434
Bye aunty.

1579
02:11:03,390 --> 02:11:05,255
Excuse me!
Excuse me. Please please!

1580
02:11:07,060 --> 02:11:07,992
Buddy!

1581
02:11:08,361 --> 02:11:10,022
No one gives anyone
a lift around here.

1582
02:11:10,097 --> 02:11:11,086
Go find some other way,

1583
02:11:11,198 --> 02:11:13,792
instead of standing
here & dancing around.

1584
02:11:18,004 --> 02:11:20,097
Oye! Excuse me.

1585
02:11:20,307 --> 02:11:22,275
Stop Stop Stop.

1586
02:11:30,016 --> 02:11:32,280

02:11:34,387 --> 02:11:37,220
Give me my cycle back

1589
02:11:38,125 --> 02:11:39,217
Excuse me!

1590
02:11:41,194 --> 02:11:42,161
Hello!

1591
02:11:44,397 --> 02:11:45,421
Hello!

1592
02:11:47,400 --> 02:11:48,332
Hello!

1593
02:11:49,169 --> 02:11:50,067
Brother!

1594
02:11:51,772 --> 02:11:52,500
Brother!

1595
02:12:02,315 --> 02:12:03,213
Brother!

1596
02:12:03,750 --> 02:12:05,513
Brother! Will you stop please?

1597
02:12:13,226 --> 02:12:14,056
Hello!

1598
02:12:23,470 --> 02:12:24,266
Get in.

1599
02:12:24,471 --> 02:12:25,335
What?

1600
02:12:25,505 --> 02:12:26,335
Get inside.

1601
02:12:27,808 --> 02:12:29,173
- Are you looking for the door?
- Yes.

1602
02:12:29,342 --> 02:12:31,139
- It's on the other side.
- Oh ok.

1603
02:12:38,785 --> 02:12:39,945
- Water?
- Ah, thanks.

1604
02:12:40,053 --> 02:12:41,350
The cycle?

1605
02:12:41,788 --> 02:12:42,948
That's okay.

1606
02:12:43,323 --> 02:12:44,312
It's not mine.

1607
02:12:53,900 --> 02:12:58,166
I have been looking for you
for a week, then I heard...

1608
02:13:01,174 --> 02:13:05,804
Someone said they'd
seen your van around here.

1609
02:13:08,048 --> 02:13:08,776
Oh hi!

1610
02:13:16,223 --> 02:13:16,917
Sit.

1611
02:13:21,962 --> 02:13:24,897
We're holding a memorial event for
Jenny at the college.

1612
02:13:25,432 --> 02:13:29,061
Would you be able to attend?

1613
02:13:31,905 --> 02:13:33,338
Actually all of you.

1614
02:13:33,440 --> 02:13:37,103
If your whole family could attend...
Would be really nice.

1615
02:13:44,351 --> 02:13:47,548
To say this to her brother...
It's really weird.

1616
02:13:51,157 --> 02:13:52,988
I really liked Jenny.

1617
02:13:55,295 --> 02:13:59,391
During song rehearsals
we got very close...

1618
02:14:01,935 --> 02:14:02,993
...a bit close.

1619
02:14:04,938 --> 02:14:08,305
About her sickness...
...she never told me.

1620
02:14:08,842 --> 02:14:11,902
So I panicked when I found out.

1621
02:14:13,179 --> 02:14:16,842
I didnt know how to deal with
It... ljust...

1622
02:14:17,484 --> 02:14:18,416
I just left.

1623
02:14:22,422 --> 02:14:23,821
I shouldn't have.

1624
02:14:35,468 --> 02:14:37,834
Get in.
Will drop you at a workshop.

1625
02:14:45,979 --> 02:14:46,843
Sophie.

1626
02:15:16,977 --> 02:15:18,444
Jennifer Thomas...

1627
02:15:19,079 --> 02:15:20,478
Jenny, to all of us.

1628
02:15:21,414 --> 02:15:25,009
She was not someone everyone knew.

1629
02:15:25,418 --> 02:15:27,249
She missed many classes.

1630
02:15:27,487 --> 02:15:31,321
But unlike us,
it was for good reason.

1631
02:15:32,058 --> 02:15:35,892
For those of us who knew her,
Jenny will always be special.

1632
02:15:38,031 --> 02:15:40,829
Im sure she'll be with us forever.

1633
02:15:42,035 --> 02:15:46,233
We've gathered here to introduce
Jenny to those who didnt know her,

1634
02:15:46,406 --> 02:15:49,170
and share her memories
with those who did.

1635
02:15:50,543 --> 02:15:53,774
Krish will share one
of Jenny's poems with us.

1636
02:15:53,947 --> 02:15:54,777
Krish...

1637
02:16:01,354 --> 02:16:09,227
Though there is no one left to come,

1638
02:16:10,530 --> 02:16:18,198
Though there is no moonlight till dawn

1639
02:16:20,840 --> 02:16:29,839
Lone petal, you stood out alone,
awaiting someone,

1640
02:16:30,016 --> 02:16:34,476
Among memories,
Than sink in the mist,

1641
02:16:34,521 --> 02:16:39,049
like some unknown ﬂower

1642
02:16:39,459 --> 02:16:47,366
Did the morning light come close?

1643
02:16:48,835 --> 02:16:55,502
Did it see the tear stained cheeks?

1644
02:16:55,875 --> 02:17:04,249
But without even a touch,
it has drifted

1645
02:17:05,018 --> 02:17:12,891
Far away..far far away has it gone?

1646
02:17:14,227 --> 02:17:22,032
Far away..far far away has it gone?

1647
02:17:43,923 --> 02:17:52,194
In your memory, in your dream

1648
02:17:52,832 --> 02:18:01,968
Sweet honeyed ﬂowers didn't turn up

1649
02:18:02,775 --> 02:18:10,079
With unwavering gaze,
you waited every night

1650
02:18:11,985 --> 02:18:16,081
With no one to witness

1651
02:18:16,256 --> 02:18:22,126
Did you swim those dark depths?

1652
02:18:23,263 --> 02:18:27,495
The shadows lengthen

1653
02:18:27,867 --> 02:18:31,428
Sorrow rains down the valley

1654
02:18:32,372 --> 02:18:41,747
Like melting candles,
you disappear in deep wishes

1655
02:18:44,284 --> 02:18:53,283
More petals fall away,

1656
02:18:53,459 --> 02:19:00,956
in the listless wandering breeze

1657
02:19:02,869 --> 02:19:11,368
Never to return, these moments

1658
02:19:12,045 --> 02:19:19,952
Have they fallen away, out ofsight?

1659
02:19:21,254 --> 02:19:32,995
Have they fallen away, out ofsight?

1660
02:19:42,809 --> 02:19:43,798
Hey!

1661
02:19:44,143 --> 02:19:46,134
Thats Jenny's brother!

1662
02:20:03,229 --> 02:20:04,958
Brother!

1663
02:20:06,232 --> 02:20:07,790
Go!

1664
02:20:09,035 --> 02:20:11,128
Please leave!

1665
02:21:04,957 --> 02:21:08,324
Isn't this what they call heaven... Bro?

1666
02:21:12,165 --> 02:21:13,063
Right now...

1667
02:21:15,501 --> 02:21:16,365
Right here...

1668
02:21:56,442 --> 02:21:58,034
Aren't you feeling cold?

1669
02:22:01,914 --> 02:22:03,176
What's on your mind?

1670
02:22:05,118 --> 02:22:06,085
Nothing.

1671
02:22:11,924 --> 02:22:13,915
Im going to the lake.

1672
02:22:14,527 --> 02:22:15,391
Coming?

1673
02:22:15,928 --> 02:22:17,793
Go on... Ill join you.

1674
02:22:26,472 --> 02:22:28,838
Bro... I have a question

1675
02:22:29,375 --> 02:22:33,072
Would you both like to
have a daughter... or a son?

1676
02:22:40,453 --> 02:22:41,317
Both.

1677
02:22:42,121 --> 02:22:42,815
Oh!

1678
02:22:49,462 --> 02:22:51,453
Youll make a great dad.

1679
02:22:59,839 --> 02:23:00,464
Josh!

1680
02:23:07,013 --> 02:23:08,173
Go go.

1681
02:24:03,469 --> 02:24:04,561
What is it?

1682
02:24:16,249 --> 02:24:18,217
Josh, what happened?

1683
02:24:28,361 --> 02:24:29,191
Josh...

1684
02:24:29,462 --> 02:24:30,486
Jenny!

1685
02:24:33,132 --> 02:24:33,564
Josh...

1686
02:24:33,833 --> 02:24:34,356
Jenny...

1687
02:24:36,936 --> 02:24:37,903
What happened?

1688
02:25:58,017 --> 02:26:02,044
Jenny... is gone...

1689
02:26:52,204 --> 02:26:55,367
Josh needs some time now...

1690
02:26:56,308 --> 02:26:57,172
SO...

1691
02:26:59,378 --> 02:27:02,404
What he needs is a companion.

1692
02:27:06,986 --> 02:27:08,180
Will you be there?

1693
02:27:26,372 --> 02:27:28,397
Where did you go in the rain?

1694
02:27:28,974 --> 02:27:31,135
I went to cover up the van.

1695
02:27:31,243 --> 02:27:33,074
If it gets rusted in these rains...
when the sahib comes...

1696
02:27:40,086 --> 02:27:41,053
Yoshe!

1697
02:27:42,855 --> 02:27:44,186
That's Jenny's van...

1698
02:27:44,857 --> 02:27:45,949
Nobody...

1699
02:27:46,158 --> 02:27:47,523
will take it anywhere.

1700
02:28:47,787 --> 02:28:48,811
Josh...

1701
02:29:14,513 --> 02:29:17,346
Ashwin Ashwin!
Come on come on!

1702
02:29:17,817 --> 02:29:20,308
Come on pass the ball. Come on.

1703
02:29:21,453 --> 02:29:24,286
Mark your players.

1704
02:29:24,456 --> 02:29:26,822
Come on. Come on.

1705
02:29:27,226 --> 02:29:28,454
Aby, play fair play fair...

1706
02:29:28,527 --> 02:29:30,085
(HORN sound)

1707
02:29:37,069 --> 02:29:38,798
Come on.

1708
02:30:11,303 --> 02:30:12,395
- Hello!
- Hello...

1709
02:30:12,805 --> 02:30:13,430
Yoshe!

1710
02:30:13,973 --> 02:30:16,100
We're taking Sophie to the hospital...

1711
02:30:16,508 --> 02:30:18,203
You come there directly.

1712
02:30:31,523 --> 02:30:33,821
- There he is.
- Yoshe! Come...

1713
02:30:36,428 --> 02:30:37,793
Youve become a father!

1714
02:30:44,103 --> 02:30:46,003
Yoshe... It's a girl!
