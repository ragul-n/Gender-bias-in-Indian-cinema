1
00:02:31,498 --> 00:02:34,490
Only Allah is the one that kills.

2
00:02:34,701 --> 00:02:36,601
Now not even Allah can save you.

3
00:02:38,038 --> 00:02:39,801
What have I done?

4
00:02:40,373 --> 00:02:42,364
After killing so
many innocent people...

5
00:02:42,442 --> 00:02:44,433
...you ask what you have done.

6
00:02:44,711 --> 00:02:47,805
Everyone is a prey in this world.

7
00:02:48,715 --> 00:02:50,114
And everyone is a hunter.

8
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,775
No one is innocent.

9
00:02:55,989 --> 00:02:59,390
Those, who vote for
the coward leaders...

10
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:02,451
...my fight is against them.

11
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:06,392
Those who pay taxes,
with that money...

12
00:03:06,466 --> 00:03:10,402
...the government setup military...

13
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:14,907
...and send people like
you to kill people like me!

14
00:03:16,476 --> 00:03:20,412
And people like you, wag
their tails on their orders...

15
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,142
...and come to kill us!

16
00:03:23,984 --> 00:03:26,646
I do as I please.

17
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,779
I decide my own task!

18
00:03:28,855 --> 00:03:30,482
Every breath of air
I breathe is free!

19
00:03:30,557 --> 00:03:38,157
I can give you the
reason of my every action.

20
00:03:38,231 --> 00:03:39,664
Can you tell me?

21
00:03:44,638 --> 00:03:48,438
If you are fighting
for your country...

22
00:03:48,508 --> 00:03:51,966
...then tell me,
what is your country?

23
00:03:53,947 --> 00:03:55,175
Your senior officers!

24
00:03:55,782 --> 00:03:58,808
Your coward government,
that pays you.

25
00:04:00,654 --> 00:04:06,923
Or the innocent public...
whom you don't even know.

26
00:04:08,061 --> 00:04:09,824
Who don't know you!

27
00:04:10,063 --> 00:04:12,190
Whom you haven't met till today.

28
00:04:12,699 --> 00:04:15,532
To whom your life and death
doest make any difference!

29
00:04:18,038 --> 00:04:19,903
What do you love?

30
00:04:23,076 --> 00:04:25,544
I know, that you don't know!

31
00:04:27,047 --> 00:04:29,481
Because until now...

32
00:04:29,549 --> 00:04:33,076
...you have never asked
this question to yourself.

33
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:58,509
I am not saying Divya,
that whatever Sultan said...

34
00:04:58,578 --> 00:05:00,944
...that day was right!

35
00:05:02,849 --> 00:05:04,510
I am not saying even saying,
that Sultan was right...

36
00:05:04,584 --> 00:05:05,846
...or I am wrong!

37
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,654
We say that Sultan is bad.

38
00:05:08,722 --> 00:05:11,088
But who decides what's
good and what's bad.

39
00:05:12,192 --> 00:05:15,025
And then, what's the
difference between us and him?

40
00:05:16,796 --> 00:05:19,128
He kills people and
I kill people too.

41
00:05:21,134 --> 00:05:22,192
There is one difference!

42
00:05:23,603 --> 00:05:24,661
Feelings!

43
00:05:24,738 --> 00:05:26,262
Which I experienced in his eyes!

44
00:05:27,007 --> 00:05:28,531
There was a
commitment in his every word...

45
00:05:28,608 --> 00:05:30,075
...in everything! A feeling!

46
00:05:30,143 --> 00:05:33,271
I receive my senior
officer's orders, shoot.

47
00:05:35,215 --> 00:05:36,546
And I push the trigger!

48
00:05:37,884 --> 00:05:39,181
I am just a gun.

49
00:05:41,087 --> 00:05:42,554
Who has no sense, no reasoning...

50
00:05:42,622 --> 00:05:44,613
...and someone else is using him.

51
00:05:44,891 --> 00:05:45,949
I don't have anything.

52
00:05:46,026 --> 00:05:47,618
I don't have any motive, Divya.

53
00:05:47,694 --> 00:05:50,857
Sultan has a motive, and you don't.

54
00:05:51,631 --> 00:05:54,293
Divya, I want to live
for those whom I love.

55
00:05:54,901 --> 00:05:59,634
If everyone starts
thinking for themselves like you.

56
00:06:00,173 --> 00:06:03,631
Then what will be the meaning
of this society, this world?

57
00:06:08,248 --> 00:06:10,307
It's better that we don't
talk about these things.

58
00:06:10,917 --> 00:06:13,147
I know about these
things much better than you.

59
00:06:14,654 --> 00:06:17,214
Nothing is more valuable
for me than you and Binty!

60
00:06:29,936 --> 00:06:36,865
In Delhi at Sarojini Nagar after 3
powerful explosions, with 100 dead...

61
00:06:36,943 --> 00:06:40,606
Amaan, he is that same Sultan,
isn't it? - Yes.

62
00:06:41,147 --> 00:06:45,607
This Jihad is the
consequence of our emotions...

63
00:06:45,685 --> 00:06:50,054
...and our strong commitments.

64
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:56,088
This massacre and
explosions will not stop now.

65
00:06:57,163 --> 00:07:01,623
Now, I will keep killing
the Indian government...

66
00:07:01,701 --> 00:07:06,934
...and the officers of
the Indian government.

67
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,367
I don't understand,
what is all this going on?

68
00:07:09,976 --> 00:07:11,034
That's the thing!

69
00:07:11,244 --> 00:07:12,643
If you can't
understand anything, then...

70
00:07:12,712 --> 00:07:15,374
...why think about it
and spoil your mood!

71
00:07:15,982 --> 00:07:17,643
Change the channel and watch MTV!

72
00:07:18,718 --> 00:07:20,310
Hero, switch to cartoons.

73
00:07:20,386 --> 00:07:21,819
Hero, switch to cartoons.

74
00:07:21,888 --> 00:07:24,982
Hero, switch to cartoons.

75
00:07:36,069 --> 00:07:40,403
'Twinkle, twinkle little star.'

76
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:45,006
'How I wonder what you are.'

77
00:07:45,278 --> 00:07:49,840
'Up above the sky so high.'

78
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:54,949
'Like a diamond in the sky.'

79
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:18,368
Yes!

80
00:08:21,281 --> 00:08:22,373
Ahmad Hussain.

81
00:08:25,318 --> 00:08:28,116
Mumbai Police, Special Cell.

82
00:08:31,357 --> 00:08:32,449
I was drinking coffee in the car.

83
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:35,721
Actually, I don't mind one more.

84
00:08:39,332 --> 00:08:40,390
Thank you.

85
00:08:40,466 --> 00:08:42,730
I found out about you from
the military intelligence wing.

86
00:08:44,804 --> 00:08:47,739
You know, what happened in Delhi!

87
00:08:47,807 --> 00:08:50,071
About 100 people died in the blast.

88
00:08:50,143 --> 00:08:51,872
How does that link up to me?

89
00:08:52,946 --> 00:08:54,004
Sultan!

90
00:08:59,085 --> 00:09:01,918
Ms. Divya, I would like
to talk to him in private.

91
00:09:03,356 --> 00:09:06,325
During the blast,
Sultan was in Delhi.

92
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:10,487
He likes to
supervise his operations.

93
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:12,395
We have found only one link.

94
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:16,769
In the last 2 years the
people we have arrested...

95
00:09:16,836 --> 00:09:19,828
...they work for the RD gang.

96
00:09:20,373 --> 00:09:22,773
Most of the terrorists are
from out of the country...

97
00:09:22,842 --> 00:09:25,174
...that's why the ground
support that they need...

98
00:09:25,245 --> 00:09:27,475
I mean, smuggling in the explosives.

99
00:09:27,547 --> 00:09:32,177
Making arrangements for
their stay, RD does all that.

100
00:09:33,386 --> 00:09:35,786
We thought, if the
terrorists can use the underworld...

101
00:09:35,855 --> 00:09:38,790
...to reach us, then why
don't we use the same medium...

102
00:09:38,858 --> 00:09:41,850
...to reach to them.

103
00:09:42,128 --> 00:09:44,790
That's we used our best
officer Sudhakar Rowde...

104
00:09:44,864 --> 00:09:49,062
...as an informer in RD's gang.

105
00:09:49,135 --> 00:09:54,072
And he sent back! Rowde's head.

106
00:09:55,475 --> 00:09:59,809
RD found out about Rowde
because there are many...

107
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:04,213
...people in our beloved
department that work for RD!

108
00:10:04,284 --> 00:10:07,811
That's why my new
idea is that we send...

109
00:10:07,887 --> 00:10:10,321
...such a person in RD's gang
that's not a police official.

110
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:14,155
And you want me to
give him training. - No!

111
00:10:16,429 --> 00:10:20,388
I want you to go.

112
00:10:21,167 --> 00:10:23,897
Me! Why me?

113
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:27,406
Because you have
received commando training.

114
00:10:28,374 --> 00:10:29,898
And the most important thing.

115
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:35,904
Just once, but...
you have seen Sultan.

116
00:10:40,453 --> 00:10:43,854
So you want that on your orders...

117
00:10:43,923 --> 00:10:47,222
...I leave me life, my family
and live a life of criminals.

118
00:10:49,429 --> 00:10:54,366
In a way, you are giving me
a contract to kill Sultan.

119
00:10:56,202 --> 00:10:58,932
Yes!
- You are wasting your time.

120
00:10:59,872 --> 00:11:02,864
You have won so many
medals in the army for bravery...

121
00:11:02,942 --> 00:11:05,172
...so I can't call you a coward.

122
00:11:05,244 --> 00:11:07,610
Even if you do, it won't
make a difference to me.

123
00:11:07,947 --> 00:11:12,281
So... you won't do the job!

124
00:11:14,487 --> 00:11:16,045
Are you threatening me?

125
00:11:18,491 --> 00:11:21,358
What's the use of
threatening useless people like you?

126
00:11:21,427 --> 00:11:24,362
Look, I have left the army.

127
00:11:25,231 --> 00:11:27,961
And I want to live a normal life.

128
00:11:28,034 --> 00:11:30,525
The people that died in Delhi,
they were ordinary people.

129
00:11:32,505 --> 00:11:34,905
Yes, your colonel told
me that your family...

130
00:11:34,974 --> 00:11:37,408
...is more important for
you than your country.

131
00:11:38,411 --> 00:11:40,538
Amaan, there is a
difference in your thinking.

132
00:11:40,613 --> 00:11:44,310
But many times, situations
change the way we think.

133
00:11:45,418 --> 00:11:46,476
And maybe this is the chance.

134
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,578
This is the chance.

135
00:11:49,255 --> 00:11:53,658
Yes, if you want time to think.
Then you can. - No!

136
00:11:54,994 --> 00:11:56,586
You want to fight against terrorism.

137
00:11:57,597 --> 00:11:58,655
Good luck to you.

138
00:11:59,432 --> 00:12:00,990
I am not interested in it.

139
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:08,939
This is for you.

140
00:12:09,008 --> 00:12:11,408
Amaan... it's beautiful.

141
00:12:12,278 --> 00:12:15,941
You brought such an
expensive bangle for mummy...

142
00:12:16,015 --> 00:12:19,280
...and for me, a doll
worth 100 rupees, not fair.

143
00:12:19,352 --> 00:12:21,547
Why? You wanted it!

144
00:12:21,621 --> 00:12:24,488
I want a bangle like mummy.

145
00:12:24,557 --> 00:12:28,459
Let's do one thing, we will
share your doll and my bangle.

146
00:12:28,528 --> 00:12:29,586
Give me five!

147
00:12:30,563 --> 00:12:32,554
Hero, I am giving
you the last warning.

148
00:12:32,632 --> 00:12:36,033
I don't want any
politics between me and mummy.

149
00:12:46,546 --> 00:12:48,980
As I stepped on the
clouds and flew away.

150
00:12:49,048 --> 00:12:51,710
I found the sky!

151
00:12:52,585 --> 00:12:54,553
As I stepped on the
clouds and flew away.

152
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:57,680
I found the sky!

153
00:12:58,591 --> 00:13:02,994
I lived this live like a saga.

154
00:15:52,632 --> 00:15:53,690
Who are you?

155
00:15:53,766 --> 00:15:54,824
How did you come here?
- Sir.

156
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,162
Sir. I am Amaan Malik!

157
00:15:56,235 --> 00:15:57,361
You had come to my home.

158
00:16:14,787 --> 00:16:17,255
I don't have any sympathy with you.

159
00:16:17,523 --> 00:16:20,492
That your daughter and
wife were killed in the blast.

160
00:16:21,527 --> 00:16:23,188
Amongst the ordinary
people that died...

161
00:16:23,262 --> 00:16:25,389
...those two were among them too!

162
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,267
Just one chance, sir!

163
00:16:34,507 --> 00:16:35,565
One chance!

164
00:16:42,882 --> 00:16:43,940
Please!

165
00:16:47,219 --> 00:16:53,556
To reach Sultan, you need
brains and not emotions!

166
00:16:58,831 --> 00:17:01,231
Today, the underworld is
divided into two parts.

167
00:17:02,301 --> 00:17:06,431
First, RD. You have to enter
his gang and reach Sultan!

168
00:17:07,573 --> 00:17:10,371
And the second, Goonga!

169
00:17:11,844 --> 00:17:13,971
He was RD's most trusted man once.

170
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:20,248
After today, whatever happens...

171
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:22,947
...it will be between the two of us.

172
00:17:23,322 --> 00:17:24,846
I won't tell anyone.

173
00:17:25,591 --> 00:17:26,785
Not even to the commissioner.

174
00:17:27,593 --> 00:17:28,651
Got it.

175
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:33,560
I know your parents are
no more in this world.

176
00:17:34,867 --> 00:17:37,267
But today onward,
your parents will be...

177
00:17:37,336 --> 00:17:41,864
...Taslima Banu and Mohammad Yusuf.

178
00:17:41,941 --> 00:17:43,704
And they stay in Nasik.

179
00:17:43,776 --> 00:17:45,004
I didn't understand.

180
00:17:45,611 --> 00:17:48,341
I have prepared a
false background for you...

181
00:17:48,414 --> 00:17:50,507
...so that no one suspects you.

182
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:54,781
That's why today onward, you
will be Amaan and not Aman!

183
00:17:55,621 --> 00:17:58,419
Your driving licence! Passport!

184
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:00,683
Ration Card!

185
00:18:02,495 --> 00:18:03,621
Amaan Ali Yusuf!

186
00:18:04,363 --> 00:18:05,489
Do you believe in God?

187
00:18:09,368 --> 00:18:10,630
Never thought about it.

188
00:18:10,703 --> 00:18:14,298
Like any other company,
the underworld...

189
00:18:14,373 --> 00:18:16,534
...also searches for new recruits.

190
00:18:17,643 --> 00:18:20,305
If someone carves a
niche for himself...

191
00:18:20,379 --> 00:18:23,371
...then it's not
difficult to enter the gang.

192
00:18:23,649 --> 00:18:27,380
I have made a plan so that
you can enter the RD gang.

193
00:18:27,653 --> 00:18:30,451
But how do gangsters behave?!

194
00:18:30,523 --> 00:18:33,390
How do they work?! I don't know.

195
00:18:33,659 --> 00:18:34,819
You will be trained.

196
00:18:36,662 --> 00:18:39,324
And there is no one
better than the police...

197
00:18:39,398 --> 00:18:42,390
...to train you for the underworld.

198
00:18:46,872 --> 00:18:48,669
That was supposed to be a joke.

199
00:18:51,677 --> 00:18:53,975
Sir, I am not in the mood to laugh.

200
00:18:54,413 --> 00:18:59,407
Twinkle, twinkle little star!

201
00:18:59,685 --> 00:19:04,987
How I wonder what you are.

202
00:19:05,057 --> 00:19:10,427
Twinkle, twinkle little star!

203
00:19:10,496 --> 00:19:15,661
How I wonder what you are.

204
00:19:15,868 --> 00:19:20,965
Up above the world so high!

205
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:24,441
We should plant a bomb.

206
00:19:43,729 --> 00:19:53,798
Colourful Holi has come, it
brought the spots of blood.

207
00:19:54,473 --> 00:19:59,467
Then came the effervescent Diwali.

208
00:19:59,745 --> 00:20:04,808
But still it couldn't
get rid of the darkness.

209
00:20:05,484 --> 00:20:10,148
All the
celebrations with holidays.

210
00:20:10,756 --> 00:20:15,693
The bombs of Mumbai,
the crackers of Kashmir.

211
00:20:15,961 --> 00:20:24,027
All the burnt bodies... called out.

212
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:43,078
How did the small boy die?

213
00:20:43,522 --> 00:20:48,516
There was poison in
the mother's milk.

214
00:20:48,794 --> 00:20:53,754
It was just last night.

215
00:20:53,899 --> 00:20:59,201
My father didn't return home.

216
00:20:59,805 --> 00:21:02,535
We received the
post-mortem report.

217
00:21:02,608 --> 00:21:05,634
We should plant a bomb.

218
00:21:10,816 --> 00:21:15,753
Staying alive is a big problem.

219
00:21:16,555 --> 00:21:21,049
Everything is an illusion.

220
00:21:21,827 --> 00:21:28,892
The bird died after
crashing into the building.

221
00:21:32,171 --> 00:21:39,236
They will kill me by
barging in my house.

222
00:21:41,847 --> 00:21:44,509
There is very little
difference between saving a life...

223
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:47,814
...and killing someone.

224
00:21:48,887 --> 00:21:52,152
We should plant a bomb.

225
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:59,156
Now you will have to go to
the employment exchange.

226
00:21:59,598 --> 00:22:00,656
What do you mean?

227
00:22:02,101 --> 00:22:03,193
Jail!

228
00:22:05,738 --> 00:22:08,605
The gangsters are
recruited from there.

229
00:22:09,074 --> 00:22:12,737
I have filed 2-3 false
cases in your false name.

230
00:22:13,879 --> 00:22:17,610
So, you will have to go to jail.

231
00:22:21,153 --> 00:22:22,745
Will I get coffee?
- Yes sir.

232
00:22:40,572 --> 00:22:44,565
Jail is a place which the
government has allotted...

233
00:22:44,643 --> 00:22:48,238
...for the criminals for
carrying out their activities.

234
00:22:48,914 --> 00:22:50,905
People commit crimes outside.

235
00:22:51,183 --> 00:22:53,913
But they become criminals there.

236
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:00,818
Name.
- Amaan!

237
00:23:05,931 --> 00:23:07,990
You have a very strong body.

238
00:23:08,067 --> 00:23:10,934
When I ask for your name
then tell me your full name.

239
00:23:12,204 --> 00:23:13,262
Amaan Ali Yusuf.

240
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:18,899
And listen, this body
of yours won't do here!

241
00:23:22,181 --> 00:23:25,207
A.K. Rao. The most
trusted man of Goonga!

242
00:23:26,151 --> 00:23:29,678
To reach Sultan, you
will first have to reach RD.

243
00:23:29,755 --> 00:23:33,691
And to reach RD, your
first step will be A.K. Rao.

244
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:38,152
He controls the jail!
Because the jailer is with him.

245
00:23:39,198 --> 00:23:41,689
All of RD's people
that are in jail...

246
00:23:42,167 --> 00:23:44,362
...A.K. Rao is making
life difficult for them.

247
00:23:46,171 --> 00:23:47,695
Even though he is so powerful...

248
00:23:47,973 --> 00:23:50,908
...RD couldn't harm A. K Rao!

249
00:23:50,976 --> 00:23:52,068
As soon as you get the chance...

250
00:23:55,247 --> 00:23:57,715
...kill A. K Rao.
- But how?

251
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:00,718
Did you ever ask this
question in the army?

252
00:24:01,987 --> 00:24:05,787
No one's life holds any
value for Sultan's life.

253
00:24:06,258 --> 00:24:08,385
Work is more important than life.

254
00:24:24,009 --> 00:24:26,409
We couldn't do anything to RD.

255
00:24:26,478 --> 00:24:28,105
And now there is
another RD in the making.

256
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:29,340
What is his name?

257
00:24:29,748 --> 00:24:30,976
Amaan Ali Yusuf!

258
00:24:32,151 --> 00:24:33,948
Biloo, don't make a noise.

259
00:24:36,088 --> 00:24:38,682
Here, have a toffee.

260
00:24:41,293 --> 00:24:44,421
This boy... doesn't
belong to RD's gang.

261
00:24:45,764 --> 00:24:47,823
And he is doing his work.

262
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:50,700
Ma'am, if the father is famous...

263
00:24:50,769 --> 00:24:53,397
...there are many sons that show up.

264
00:25:00,312 --> 00:25:02,439
What's the latest on RD?

265
00:25:03,782 --> 00:25:06,910
Goonga tried to kill RD but failed.

266
00:25:07,786 --> 00:25:08,844
And I have also heard that...

267
00:25:08,921 --> 00:25:10,320
...one of his man was caught too.

268
00:25:25,304 --> 00:25:26,362
Tell me!

269
00:25:36,281 --> 00:25:37,339
Tell me, who sent you?

270
00:25:54,366 --> 00:25:58,427
Loyalty is a good thing, but
fate doesn't understand that.

271
00:26:00,105 --> 00:26:01,163
Tell me.

272
00:26:15,854 --> 00:26:17,344
Next time, you will die.

273
00:26:25,864 --> 00:26:26,922
He is dead.

274
00:26:26,999 --> 00:26:29,524
Died! How did he die?

275
00:26:29,868 --> 00:26:31,529
Karim, how many
times have I told you?

276
00:26:31,603 --> 00:26:32,797
Supply the right voltage of current!

277
00:26:32,871 --> 00:26:33,963
Now he is dead!

278
00:26:34,039 --> 00:26:35,097
Sorry!

279
00:26:35,173 --> 00:26:36,265
Sorry RD!

280
00:26:40,379 --> 00:26:42,074
Have you ever done anything in life?

281
00:26:46,151 --> 00:26:49,416
Don't try showing me your karate.

282
00:26:49,888 --> 00:26:52,015
This is the era of
Osama and not Bruce Lee.

283
00:26:56,428 --> 00:26:57,827
How many times have I told you...

284
00:26:57,896 --> 00:27:00,558
...to stop acting so childishly.

285
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,458
For the last time.

286
00:27:02,534 --> 00:27:03,899
Fine, I will talk to you later.

287
00:27:04,436 --> 00:27:05,562
A. K Rao is dead.

288
00:27:07,172 --> 00:27:10,232
A boy named Amaan has killed
him in the Arthur Road jail.

289
00:27:10,309 --> 00:27:11,571
Is he from our gang?

290
00:27:12,177 --> 00:27:16,841
After killing him, our men
created a riot so that during the...

291
00:27:16,915 --> 00:27:21,909
...inquiry no one will know
that Amaan has killed him.

292
00:27:22,187 --> 00:27:23,848
But who is he?

293
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:26,248
I don't know.

294
00:27:27,459 --> 00:27:29,086
But our men were praising him a lot.

295
00:27:30,929 --> 00:27:31,987
A. K Rao is dead.

296
00:27:32,464 --> 00:27:34,159
Now what did Goonga say?

297
00:27:52,351 --> 00:27:55,411
They killed him by
giving him electric shocks.

298
00:27:57,456 --> 00:27:59,185
Hey Mirchi!
- Yes.

299
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:05,953
RD's gang killed him by giving
him electric shocks last night.

300
00:28:06,431 --> 00:28:09,161
But how electric...
- I don't know.

301
00:28:09,234 --> 00:28:11,327
All Munna said was... they killed
him by giving electric shocks.

302
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:16,965
You, but you... why did you
send him on such a... - Hey you...

303
00:28:17,242 --> 00:28:19,039
He is your uncle's son, later.

304
00:28:19,244 --> 00:28:20,973
First, he was my best shooter.

305
00:28:21,046 --> 00:28:22,308
The best.

306
00:28:23,515 --> 00:28:25,983
Killing and getting killed,
that's our business!

307
00:28:26,518 --> 00:28:28,986
He had given me a sari.
- I know.

308
00:28:29,388 --> 00:28:31,583
He liked the food cooked by me.

309
00:28:31,656 --> 00:28:33,283
I know he was very dear to you.

310
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:36,654
What can we do?

311
00:28:36,928 --> 00:28:37,986
It just happened.

312
00:28:38,063 --> 00:28:39,223
Forget it! Forget it!

313
00:28:40,532 --> 00:28:41,590
Lord!

314
00:28:41,666 --> 00:28:43,657
I told you so many times.

315
00:28:45,003 --> 00:28:46,561
Your plan will not work.

316
00:28:46,638 --> 00:28:48,936
Don't make me open my mouth.

317
00:28:49,007 --> 00:28:51,475
I attacked RD's gang in Muscat.

318
00:28:51,543 --> 00:28:54,603
You had said it would fail!
It would fail!

319
00:28:54,679 --> 00:28:56,169
But it was a success, isn't it?

320
00:28:56,248 --> 00:28:57,306
It was a super success.

321
00:28:57,382 --> 00:28:59,680
It would fail! It would fail!
That's all you say.

322
00:28:59,751 --> 00:29:01,013
Goonga, forget all this.

323
00:29:02,521 --> 00:29:05,684
Now, I feel you should
change your gang members.

324
00:29:07,025 --> 00:29:08,083
All of them are useless!

325
00:29:09,294 --> 00:29:10,352
What did you say?

326
00:29:10,429 --> 00:29:11,691
What did you say?

327
00:29:11,763 --> 00:29:13,526
Leave it!
- What leave it! Leave me!

328
00:29:13,598 --> 00:29:17,034
He calls my family members useless.
- Forget it!

329
00:29:17,102 --> 00:29:18,569
He calls my family members useless.
- Leave it!

330
00:29:18,637 --> 00:29:20,537
You keep sitting here like
a useless man in my house.

331
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:22,529
You eat the chicken cooked by me.

332
00:29:22,607 --> 00:29:23,665
Drink this alcohol.

333
00:29:23,742 --> 00:29:24,970
Why are you screaming?

334
00:29:25,043 --> 00:29:26,101
And you call my family
members useless.

335
00:29:26,178 --> 00:29:27,236
Why are you screaming,
come on, leave it.

336
00:29:27,312 --> 00:29:28,370
And I tell you, Anna...
- What?

337
00:29:28,447 --> 00:29:29,573
After this, no one from my
family will do your job.

338
00:29:29,648 --> 00:29:31,309
I won't ask anyone.
- You won't send anyone.

339
00:29:31,383 --> 00:29:32,441
I said no.

340
00:29:32,517 --> 00:29:33,711
Idiots!

341
00:29:34,052 --> 00:29:36,043
Go! Come on.

342
00:29:36,121 --> 00:29:37,179
Idiots!

343
00:29:39,324 --> 00:29:42,623
We have to give an answer for
every flop plan of yours in Delhi.

344
00:29:42,694 --> 00:29:45,527
Hey you, go and tell
the people in Delhi...

345
00:29:45,597 --> 00:29:48,225
In the underworld, yes sir and
no sir doesn't get your work done.

346
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:49,358
You need to take action.

347
00:29:49,434 --> 00:29:50,492
Action!

348
00:29:50,569 --> 00:29:52,002
We can see your action!

349
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:54,698
You don't have confidence in me.

350
00:29:55,507 --> 00:29:57,168
Go to some other gang.

351
00:29:57,342 --> 00:29:59,276
Lalji! Keep quiet!

352
00:29:59,344 --> 00:30:00,470
Give me the mango drink.

353
00:30:02,514 --> 00:30:03,572
Hello.

354
00:30:13,625 --> 00:30:16,150
It's sugarless! Don't
you have some sugar?

355
00:30:16,361 --> 00:30:17,453
What can I do?

356
00:30:18,363 --> 00:30:19,694
Goonga!
- Yes.

357
00:30:20,031 --> 00:30:21,157
Another of your man was killed.

358
00:30:21,233 --> 00:30:23,133
Who?
- A.K. Rao!

359
00:30:24,035 --> 00:30:25,434
When? Where? How?

360
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:27,470
Now RD will send his men...

361
00:30:27,706 --> 00:30:29,173
...to get you out of jail.

362
00:30:29,641 --> 00:30:30,699
Why?

363
00:30:30,775 --> 00:30:34,677
The flies go where the sweet is.

364
00:30:36,047 --> 00:30:38,140
And RD has a special one.

365
00:30:44,389 --> 00:30:48,223
Your lawyer, Bhashali!

366
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:54,125
The boy is dynamite!

367
00:30:54,699 --> 00:30:55,791
Inquire about him.

368
00:30:56,735 --> 00:30:58,168
If he is clean then get him out.

369
00:30:59,137 --> 00:31:02,197
I have his file! He is
a resident of Nasik.

370
00:31:02,474 --> 00:31:03,771
I will send my boys.

371
00:31:12,551 --> 00:31:13,643
Amaan lives here!

372
00:31:14,152 --> 00:31:16,177
Amaan doesn't live here.

373
00:31:17,222 --> 00:31:18,689
There you go again.

374
00:31:20,158 --> 00:31:22,183
Son, Amaan is in Mumbai!

375
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:24,660
It has been a year! He
hasn't come to meet me.

376
00:31:24,729 --> 00:31:26,822
Son, who are you.
- Thank you.

377
00:31:36,107 --> 00:31:40,168
Sir! RD's people had
come to inquire about Amaan!

378
00:31:40,412 --> 00:31:41,470
Work is done, sir.

379
00:31:49,688 --> 00:31:52,452
So you are RD's man!

380
00:31:53,625 --> 00:31:54,853
Today onward, you are too.

381
00:31:59,497 --> 00:32:02,261
I have started the
procedure to get you out.

382
00:32:13,578 --> 00:32:15,307
I can't get through to RD.

383
00:32:21,419 --> 00:32:22,886
Why didn't you get
the coffee till now?

384
00:32:23,388 --> 00:32:24,616
I am bringing it!

385
00:32:26,725 --> 00:32:29,319
How many times have I told you?
- I am bringing it!

386
00:32:29,394 --> 00:32:32,420
Don't you understand?
- I am bringing it!

387
00:32:32,497 --> 00:32:33,555
I am bringing it!

388
00:32:33,632 --> 00:32:34,690
Again, you started crying.

389
00:32:34,766 --> 00:32:36,165
I am bringing it! I am bringing it!

390
00:32:36,234 --> 00:32:39,601
It takes time, I
am adding the sugar.

391
00:32:39,838 --> 00:32:41,271
It takes time.

392
00:32:44,175 --> 00:32:45,233
Yes RD.

393
00:32:46,778 --> 00:32:47,836
Just a minute!

394
00:32:54,185 --> 00:32:55,345
Amaan!

395
00:32:55,453 --> 00:32:56,579
I will give you two options.

396
00:32:57,856 --> 00:33:00,290
First, today onward you
will work for my company.

397
00:33:00,792 --> 00:33:01,850
Second.

398
00:33:03,328 --> 00:33:04,420
Death.

399
00:33:05,196 --> 00:33:06,322
Whose?

400
00:33:11,836 --> 00:33:16,205
I will send you
special information about...

401
00:33:16,274 --> 00:33:19,539
...RD's enemies through my network.

402
00:33:19,944 --> 00:33:23,209
He will surely win.
- Jaiprakash will surely win.

403
00:33:23,281 --> 00:33:26,216
He will surely win.
- Jaiprakash will surely win.

404
00:33:26,284 --> 00:33:27,615
Vote for.
- Jaiprakash!

405
00:33:27,686 --> 00:33:29,313
Vote for.
- Jaiprakash!

406
00:33:29,387 --> 00:33:33,551
Vote for.
- Jaiprakash!

407
00:33:50,975 --> 00:33:56,470
Live!

408
00:33:58,350 --> 00:34:04,311
Or die!

409
00:34:04,856 --> 00:34:10,988
It's the last chance.

410
00:34:12,330 --> 00:34:18,360
To do anything.

411
00:34:19,604 --> 00:34:25,270
Show who you are.

412
00:34:25,343 --> 00:34:27,641
There is information
about the death of three men.

413
00:34:27,846 --> 00:34:32,545
RD gang's sharp shooter,
Amaan, has done this.

414
00:34:35,286 --> 00:34:40,815
Live!

415
00:34:42,727 --> 00:34:49,030
Or die!

416
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:55,728
It's the last chance.

417
00:34:56,508 --> 00:35:03,414
To do anything.

418
00:35:03,948 --> 00:35:10,444
Show who you are.

419
00:35:11,389 --> 00:35:18,818
It's a contract.

420
00:35:19,631 --> 00:35:20,689
Contract!

421
00:35:20,999 --> 00:35:23,399
This is the last chance,
do anything.

422
00:35:23,468 --> 00:35:26,335
Our life is so miserable.

423
00:35:26,404 --> 00:35:30,431
It's wrong to live
life like a corpse.

424
00:35:30,775 --> 00:35:34,404
Be sorrowful! Not
too much or too less.

425
00:35:34,479 --> 00:35:38,506
If you want to live,
you will have to die.

426
00:35:39,451 --> 00:35:42,943
The police cannot control
the politics within the gang.

427
00:35:43,087 --> 00:35:51,495
All I can say is that, Amaan Ali
is behind all this. - Life is...

428
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:54,760
Carefree...

429
00:35:54,833 --> 00:35:58,360
How can the Mumbai
underworld not be touched by it?

430
00:35:58,436 --> 00:36:00,370
By killing all of Goonga's men,
RD's special shooter...

431
00:36:00,438 --> 00:36:03,532
...Amaan Ali is
bringing his monopoly back.

432
00:36:03,608 --> 00:36:06,577
Amaan Ali is killing
Goonga's men one by one.

433
00:36:06,778 --> 00:36:08,370
Here the police are
counting the bodies...

434
00:36:08,446 --> 00:36:11,438
...and Amaan Ali is in
search of his new prey.

435
00:36:11,549 --> 00:36:13,449
Vikramji Tiwari, Zee news.

436
00:36:14,118 --> 00:36:21,547
This is a contract! Do anything.

437
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:27,495
These days, you don't shave.

438
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:28,657
When I an going to be beheaded...

439
00:36:28,733 --> 00:36:31,133
...then what's the use of
getting a shave. - Quiet!

440
00:36:31,503 --> 00:36:33,903
Why do you have such an
inferiority complex with RD?

441
00:36:33,972 --> 00:36:36,566
Not from RD! I have a
complex about killing RD.

442
00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:44,973
Look Goonga,
three-fourth of the world is water.

443
00:36:45,416 --> 00:36:46,610
And the rest is land.

444
00:36:47,151 --> 00:36:49,483
And there are many
like RD on the land.

445
00:36:49,721 --> 00:36:50,779
But there is only one
like you in the water.

446
00:36:54,425 --> 00:36:57,417
So you alone are the king of
this three-fourth! - What?

447
00:36:57,495 --> 00:36:58,894
What did you say? I
didn't understand!

448
00:36:58,963 --> 00:37:01,090
I am explaining Goonga
that he is so capable.

449
00:37:02,166 --> 00:37:04,532
He is capable! My dear is capable!

450
00:37:04,602 --> 00:37:07,833
He looks so nice on his birthday.
- Yes.

451
00:37:08,506 --> 00:37:10,599
No one should cast
an evil eye on him.

452
00:37:10,775 --> 00:37:14,506
I am not capable, he is capable...
that Amaan! Stop it.

453
00:37:14,579 --> 00:37:18,606
He will eradicate my entire family.

454
00:37:19,450 --> 00:37:21,714
Instead of sitting here,
go there. Stop it now.

455
00:37:21,786 --> 00:37:23,913
Stop it! I said, stop it! Go.

456
00:37:24,822 --> 00:37:26,551
Call up Delhi and ask
them to do something.

457
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:29,818
Why?

458
00:37:30,595 --> 00:37:31,687
That day you were saying...

459
00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:35,590
...the yes sir no sir of the
Delhi people won't work here.

460
00:37:36,034 --> 00:37:38,628
That was a different day.
It's a different day today.

461
00:37:38,770 --> 00:37:40,601
Do I wear the same pants everyday?

462
00:37:40,672 --> 00:37:41,730
What are you saying?

463
00:37:41,806 --> 00:37:42,864
Get lost.

464
00:37:42,941 --> 00:37:43,999
The grocery is over.

465
00:37:44,075 --> 00:37:45,133
Then go at the corner and get it.

466
00:37:45,209 --> 00:37:46,642
Papaya, orange... get everything.

467
00:37:47,045 --> 00:37:48,740
Why are you getting angry,
today is your birthday...

468
00:37:48,813 --> 00:37:50,474
Stop your family drama.

469
00:37:50,548 --> 00:37:51,606
I am doing a family drama.
- What are you doing now?

470
00:37:51,683 --> 00:37:54,652
Why don't you ever talk to
me nicely... - Stop blabbering!

471
00:37:55,753 --> 00:37:57,152
In Satara you would cut sugarcane.

472
00:37:58,189 --> 00:37:59,486
Now that you drink
lime juice on the boat...

473
00:37:59,557 --> 00:38:01,491
...what do you think of yourself.

474
00:38:01,559 --> 00:38:02,890
What do you mean to say?

475
00:38:03,227 --> 00:38:05,559
You didn't do me a
favour by bringing me here!

476
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:07,154
There were many boys after me!

477
00:38:07,231 --> 00:38:08,721
I know.

478
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,165
And two of them were
much better than you.

479
00:38:10,234 --> 00:38:12,828
I refused them.
- I know. I know everything!

480
00:38:12,904 --> 00:38:15,873
I said, don't talk rudely to me
today. - I have your entire record.

481
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:16,998
But still he will talk rudely.

482
00:38:17,075 --> 00:38:18,133
You are telling me.

483
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:20,807
Those two were better than me.

484
00:38:21,112 --> 00:38:22,602
I killed both of them.

485
00:38:23,047 --> 00:38:24,742
But who will kill Amaan Ali?

486
00:38:26,951 --> 00:38:28,646
Amaan Ali will be taken care of.

487
00:38:30,154 --> 00:38:31,587
I had a talk with the chief.

488
00:38:36,527 --> 00:38:38,995
Good afternoon, Surya Narayan.

489
00:38:40,531 --> 00:38:41,623
Give the order, sir.

490
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:46,593
What is this, Amaan Ali?
- Sir.

491
00:38:47,271 --> 00:38:48,636
Take care of him.

492
00:38:51,142 --> 00:38:52,200
Sir.

493
00:38:54,278 --> 00:38:58,977
Your expertise is growing
in the gang wars of Mumbai.

494
00:38:59,083 --> 00:39:00,710
You gave a very nice interview.

495
00:39:01,285 --> 00:39:02,650
Because believe this...

496
00:39:03,554 --> 00:39:07,888
Use of brains should be
99% and action should be 1%!

497
00:39:08,126 --> 00:39:09,650
I have been hearing that
for the past two years.

498
00:39:10,561 --> 00:39:12,688
You couldn't kill RD!

499
00:39:12,764 --> 00:39:15,130
And now there is Amaan too.

500
00:39:15,633 --> 00:39:17,692
It's not that easy to kill Amaan.

501
00:39:19,237 --> 00:39:20,670
Even for Dara!

502
00:39:21,572 --> 00:39:23,699
Encounters cannot be
the solution, ma'am.

503
00:39:24,108 --> 00:39:26,076
It's not about
reforming the society.

504
00:39:26,144 --> 00:39:28,044
It's about saving your and my job.

505
00:39:28,179 --> 00:39:29,646
We have received orders
from the higher officials.

506
00:39:30,281 --> 00:39:34,684
Keep your 99% percent
of brains to yourself...

507
00:39:34,752 --> 00:39:37,653
...and let me do the 1% of action.

508
00:39:38,322 --> 00:39:41,257
Yes, ask Dara to meet
me as soon as possible.

509
00:40:18,896 --> 00:40:20,727
This is not the Vagera police.
This is the state police.

510
00:40:21,632 --> 00:40:24,931
So what happened?

511
00:40:25,737 --> 00:40:26,795
Excuse me.

512
00:40:28,072 --> 00:40:31,007
You will be paid
directly in your account.

513
00:40:31,709 --> 00:40:32,835
So what do I do?

514
00:40:35,713 --> 00:40:38,204
You like ever do
this to other people.

515
00:40:38,282 --> 00:40:42,912
Baby, do you know who I am.

516
00:40:43,387 --> 00:40:45,719
My associates search you.

517
00:40:47,225 --> 00:40:52,822
Now is your age to become cops...

518
00:40:53,331 --> 00:40:58,268
...or criminals.
- Everyone, please.

519
00:41:02,273 --> 00:41:03,365
What's the difference?

520
00:41:03,741 --> 00:41:06,835
I feel we can work somehow.

521
00:41:14,152 --> 00:41:16,950
This is part of job,
I want to talk to you about.

522
00:41:17,021 --> 00:41:18,955
You are a trouble.
- You don't know that.

523
00:41:21,425 --> 00:41:23,017
Excuse me. - Goodnight.

524
00:41:23,094 --> 00:41:26,257
The last time I checked I took
two hour and you are not inject.

525
00:41:27,799 --> 00:41:29,289
See you...

526
00:41:29,367 --> 00:41:31,699
There are some trigger-happy people
in our police department...

527
00:41:31,769 --> 00:41:34,863
...and some wild berserks!

528
00:41:35,439 --> 00:41:38,431
Dara is a bit different from them.

529
00:41:39,177 --> 00:41:40,769
He will target.

530
00:41:40,845 --> 00:41:42,278
He thinks he is a hero.

531
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:43,779
But he is a murderer...

532
00:41:44,215 --> 00:41:47,946
...who has taken the garb
of an encounter specialist.

533
00:41:48,719 --> 00:41:51,847
You have to be very careful of him.

534
00:41:51,923 --> 00:41:53,117
What do you mean by careful?

535
00:41:53,457 --> 00:41:58,326
Kill him. Or else, he will kill you.

536
00:41:58,896 --> 00:42:01,456
Work is more important than life.

537
00:42:27,758 --> 00:42:29,055
Yes!
- Yes madam!

538
00:42:29,126 --> 00:42:31,185
I was busy that's why I
switched off the phone.

539
00:42:31,929 --> 00:42:33,157
Yes, Amaan Ali!

540
00:42:33,865 --> 00:42:34,923
I have heard about him.

541
00:42:35,399 --> 00:42:37,162
I will get his details
from the crime branch!

542
00:42:38,202 --> 00:42:39,829
Don't worry about him!

543
00:42:40,104 --> 00:42:41,264
I will take care of him.

544
00:43:39,363 --> 00:43:40,421
Mr. Dara, what is the truth?

545
00:43:40,564 --> 00:43:41,826
We heard that Amaan
Ali made you run naked...

546
00:43:41,899 --> 00:43:43,924
...through the market.
- Quiet!

547
00:43:44,001 --> 00:43:45,901
We took a photo
from the mobile phone.

548
00:43:46,304 --> 00:43:49,933
Which mobile phone do you have?

549
00:43:51,075 --> 00:43:54,101
You can see that the police of
our city is scared of the goons.

550
00:43:54,178 --> 00:43:57,511
But we...
- Look! Look, nothing has happened.

551
00:43:57,581 --> 00:43:58,912
They are lying.

552
00:43:59,183 --> 00:44:00,241
What is all this?

553
00:44:00,318 --> 00:44:03,151
Look! Look how they
are snatching our mike.

554
00:44:03,587 --> 00:44:04,849
The attack on Dara is an attack...

555
00:44:04,922 --> 00:44:06,287
...on our entire department, sir.

556
00:44:07,591 --> 00:44:10,253
Today he has barged in
his house and shot at him.

557
00:44:11,495 --> 00:44:14,430
Tomorrow he might barge in
our office and shoot us.

558
00:44:14,565 --> 00:44:17,966
If the criminals defame us,
how can the people believe in us?

559
00:44:18,169 --> 00:44:21,605
Wherever, however,
whenever you see Amaan...

560
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:23,498
...shoot him!

561
00:44:25,076 --> 00:44:27,943
I want the entire police
force to be on this job.

562
00:44:28,546 --> 00:44:30,013
The police have
become very emotional.

563
00:44:30,948 --> 00:44:33,542
Before those idiots kill our man...

564
00:44:34,385 --> 00:44:36,945
...make arrangements to
get him out of there.

565
00:44:37,521 --> 00:44:38,613
You have been called.

566
00:44:40,257 --> 00:44:42,020
Here, your life is in danger.

567
00:44:45,396 --> 00:44:48,593
For security purposes brother RD
is making you an NRI gangster.

568
00:44:51,902 --> 00:44:53,631
This is the travel plan to reach RD.

569
00:45:00,511 --> 00:45:01,569
She is gone.

570
00:45:04,382 --> 00:45:05,440
Are you married?

571
00:45:07,351 --> 00:45:08,409
Don't ever do it.

572
00:45:12,123 --> 00:45:16,651
There is an Aman in
every person of this city.

573
00:45:18,929 --> 00:45:23,525
He has a daughter, a
wife and a family.

574
00:45:24,468 --> 00:45:27,596
For all of them, and for all of us.

575
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:32,637
This... is the last fight.

576
00:45:42,386 --> 00:45:46,083
Did you ever feel that you
have taken the wrong decision?

577
00:45:47,625 --> 00:45:51,117
Decisions are never wrong,
their consequences are!

578
00:46:00,971 --> 00:46:02,063
Aman!

579
00:46:05,076 --> 00:46:06,338
Take care of yourself.

580
00:46:51,689 --> 00:46:54,089
Every death is dear to harmony.

581
00:46:54,158 --> 00:46:56,683
Our business is to kill.

582
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:59,354
Blood flows in the vein.

583
00:46:59,430 --> 00:47:02,194
It's important to shed blood.

584
00:47:02,266 --> 00:47:04,530
Every death is dear to harmony.

585
00:47:04,602 --> 00:47:07,093
Our business is to kill.

586
00:47:07,171 --> 00:47:09,639
Blood flows in the vein.

587
00:47:09,707 --> 00:47:12,471
It's important to shed blood.

588
00:48:35,559 --> 00:48:36,787
No matter what you were there...

589
00:48:37,127 --> 00:48:39,220
Your heroism won't work here.

590
00:49:53,637 --> 00:49:56,697
It's not my nature to
leave my job incomplete.

591
00:49:58,676 --> 00:50:00,268
I did it today, but never again...

592
00:50:04,648 --> 00:50:06,343
I have come to work for you.

593
00:50:07,318 --> 00:50:09,377
Not to play around with these fools.

594
00:50:12,956 --> 00:50:17,325
Hanif! Show him a place to stay.

595
00:50:19,296 --> 00:50:20,388
Come on.

596
00:50:26,236 --> 00:50:27,294
And listen!

597
00:50:30,341 --> 00:50:31,467
This is not Mumbai...

598
00:50:32,309 --> 00:50:34,903
...that you wander
out and shoot someone.

599
00:50:35,779 --> 00:50:38,976
I don't care about the place,
I only use my brains.

600
00:50:44,355 --> 00:50:47,483
RD! He is acting so smart.

601
00:50:47,725 --> 00:50:49,317
And you are quiet!

602
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:52,358
What Amaan has done for
me In such a less time...

603
00:50:53,430 --> 00:50:55,398
...it will take you your
entire lifetime to do it.

604
00:51:05,476 --> 00:51:09,435
You saw RD yourself! Personally!
- Yes.

605
00:51:09,580 --> 00:51:10,979
Fantastic!

606
00:51:11,281 --> 00:51:12,441
Who else?

607
00:51:13,350 --> 00:51:16,877
Allwyn! Yusuf! And Karim Ali!

608
00:51:17,688 --> 00:51:19,019
I know them!

609
00:51:19,289 --> 00:51:20,449
Who else?

610
00:51:20,524 --> 00:51:22,822
There is a girl, Iya!

611
00:51:23,394 --> 00:51:25,294
Who is she?
- I didn't ask.

612
00:51:25,362 --> 00:51:26,522
Don't even ask.

613
00:51:28,465 --> 00:51:30,399
From here until Sultan!

614
00:51:31,769 --> 00:51:34,033
Don't ever ask about anyone.

615
00:51:35,839 --> 00:51:38,467
Until RD doesn't say
anything himself...

616
00:51:40,377 --> 00:51:41,935
...don't say anything.

617
00:51:58,028 --> 00:52:02,397
This time I have made
the best plan to kill RD.

618
00:52:02,466 --> 00:52:05,435
It will work correctly! 100%!

619
00:52:05,669 --> 00:52:06,727
How?

620
00:52:07,070 --> 00:52:09,470
I have made such a connection!

621
00:52:11,074 --> 00:52:12,439
You can't even think about it.

622
00:52:13,777 --> 00:52:14,835
Who?

623
00:52:15,612 --> 00:52:18,410
Dara!
- That encounter king!

624
00:52:18,482 --> 00:52:20,973
Yes!
- You have gone mad.

625
00:52:21,819 --> 00:52:24,947
Forget RD! Amaan made him run naked.

626
00:52:25,355 --> 00:52:27,448
That's the point, my dear.

627
00:52:28,091 --> 00:52:29,353
The person that killed 90 people...

628
00:52:29,426 --> 00:52:33,692
...Amaan made him run
naked through the streets.

629
00:52:35,432 --> 00:52:38,765
And he must still be
raging inside about that!

630
00:52:38,869 --> 00:52:41,667
If I instigate him correctly...

631
00:52:42,105 --> 00:52:45,040
He will get so angry that...

632
00:52:45,476 --> 00:52:48,001
...RD and Amaan will surely die!

633
00:52:48,078 --> 00:52:51,514
It will surely work! Believe me!

634
00:53:16,473 --> 00:53:19,806
Why are you laughing?

635
00:53:22,045 --> 00:53:24,536
You want to see what Dara can do?

636
00:53:25,749 --> 00:53:27,410
He thinks that by going
to a foreign country...

637
00:53:27,484 --> 00:53:30,044
...and hiding under
RD's care he will be safe.

638
00:53:54,545 --> 00:53:56,513
The information about
the meeting is right.

639
00:53:56,747 --> 00:53:58,772
But we don't know where
the party is going to land.

640
00:53:59,516 --> 00:54:01,950
But one of RD's trusted
man is ready to help us.

641
00:54:13,463 --> 00:54:20,528
All I want to know is that
why are you deceiving RD?

642
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:24,898
What's the reason?

643
00:54:25,742 --> 00:54:27,937
I want to be RD!

644
00:54:39,089 --> 00:54:40,147
Hello!

645
00:54:40,223 --> 00:54:42,020
Dara sir, how are you?

646
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:45,653
Jalal was saying that you
are after Amaan to kill him.

647
00:54:45,929 --> 00:54:47,556
I heard you are after him.

648
00:54:48,498 --> 00:54:49,692
I can understand.

649
00:54:50,667 --> 00:54:53,227
It must be a very
personal reason of yours.

650
00:54:54,571 --> 00:54:57,734
But what's the use of
killing small shooters like Amaan!

651
00:54:57,874 --> 00:55:01,640
If RD dies then everybody will die!

652
00:55:02,512 --> 00:55:07,245
Dara sir, I am taking a lot
of risk by supporting you.

653
00:55:08,785 --> 00:55:11,811
RD, he should die now.

654
00:55:13,523 --> 00:55:15,184
Try to understand, Dara sir.

655
00:55:17,661 --> 00:55:18,753
Yes.

656
00:55:28,705 --> 00:55:29,797
What happened?

657
00:55:31,008 --> 00:55:32,976
Dara... that police.

658
00:55:34,978 --> 00:55:39,108
Tell me!
- That police official, Dara...

659
00:55:39,282 --> 00:55:43,685
Amaan made him run
through the market naked.

660
00:55:43,787 --> 00:55:45,220
What?

661
00:55:45,856 --> 00:55:47,653
Completely... completely naked!

662
00:55:49,693 --> 00:55:51,786
He ran naked?

663
00:55:51,862 --> 00:55:52,920
Then what happened?

664
00:55:53,096 --> 00:55:56,725
Then... Dara, he was running ahead...

665
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:58,700
...and Amaan was behind him!

666
00:55:58,835 --> 00:56:00,735
Running through the entire market.

667
00:56:01,038 --> 00:56:03,097
Everyone was enjoying the free show.

668
00:56:05,142 --> 00:56:07,576
Mumbai's top encounter specialist...

669
00:56:07,644 --> 00:56:13,742
...was running
through the streets, naked.

670
00:56:14,685 --> 00:56:18,985
He must have... must have
made him run 5... kilometres.

671
00:56:19,056 --> 00:56:20,785
5 kilometres! He
ran for 5 kilometres!

672
00:56:21,258 --> 00:56:22,657
He should have gone into some shop.

673
00:56:22,726 --> 00:56:24,023
You are blowing it
out of proportion.

674
00:56:24,594 --> 00:56:25,686
Nothing like that happened.

675
00:56:25,929 --> 00:56:27,658
He might have run for 100 feet.

676
00:56:28,598 --> 00:56:33,695
100 feet or 5 kilometres,
what difference does it make?

677
00:56:33,837 --> 00:56:35,737
He ran naked, that's important.

678
00:56:37,107 --> 00:56:38,665
Enjoy the situation.

679
00:56:41,344 --> 00:56:42,936
You made me a fool.
- No!

680
00:56:43,613 --> 00:56:44,671
Then what is he saying?

681
00:56:44,748 --> 00:56:46,716
Do you listen to him or me?
- You!

682
00:56:47,184 --> 00:56:50,210
What's important to you, 5
kilometres or naked? - Naked!

683
00:56:50,287 --> 00:56:51,345
That's all!

684
00:57:00,363 --> 00:57:03,696
Will you play?
- No!

685
00:57:05,635 --> 00:57:07,159
Are you afraid of losing?

686
00:57:09,239 --> 00:57:10,297
I get bored.

687
00:57:11,041 --> 00:57:13,066
I play because I get bored.

688
00:57:18,381 --> 00:57:20,975
Games are played to win.

689
00:57:28,759 --> 00:57:30,659
Has anyone told you,
whenever you speak...

690
00:57:30,727 --> 00:57:32,388
...you always say a dialogue.

691
00:57:40,103 --> 00:57:41,365
But I like it.

692
00:57:42,672 --> 00:57:43,832
What?

693
00:57:44,741 --> 00:57:45,799
You!

694
00:57:54,017 --> 00:57:55,780
Don't you ever feel happy?

695
00:57:55,952 --> 00:57:57,749
I don't trust happiness.

696
00:57:57,821 --> 00:57:59,846
You like crying.

697
00:58:01,892 --> 00:58:02,984
Making someone cry!

698
00:58:07,864 --> 00:58:09,092
Exchanging jokes.

699
00:58:11,701 --> 00:58:15,797
RD! Amaan has told me a secret!

700
00:58:16,973 --> 00:58:20,067
What? - How can it be
a secret if I tell you?

701
00:58:28,819 --> 00:58:29,945
What's the secret?

702
00:58:31,721 --> 00:58:32,983
She is just saying it like that!

703
00:58:34,958 --> 00:58:37,017
Iya is your...
- Sister.

704
00:58:40,230 --> 00:58:41,822
The people that are
coming in the party...

705
00:58:44,801 --> 00:58:45,859
What's the deal?

706
00:58:46,736 --> 00:58:47,964
White powder.

707
00:58:49,406 --> 00:58:52,432
Keep a low profile in the party.

708
00:58:53,910 --> 00:58:55,741
Only then will you get the chance...

709
00:58:55,812 --> 00:58:57,336
...to study the high profile people!

710
00:59:06,156 --> 00:59:07,248
Yes Sultan!

711
00:59:09,226 --> 00:59:11,990
I am thinking
something about Mumbai.

712
00:59:16,032 --> 00:59:20,867
All I need is a spark.

713
00:59:21,004 --> 00:59:25,771
I have a bomb.

714
00:59:25,842 --> 00:59:27,332
Who?
- Amaan!

715
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:32,849
Amaan!
- Amaan Ali Yusuf!

716
00:59:34,117 --> 00:59:37,883
He is a new recruit, has
he done anything earlier?

717
00:59:37,954 --> 00:59:39,046
Yes brother!

718
01:00:01,845 --> 01:00:04,211
Heart is afraid of fire.

719
01:00:06,283 --> 01:00:08,945
It again burns in
the fire of love.

720
01:00:10,420 --> 01:00:12,854
Heart is afraid of fire.

721
01:00:14,824 --> 01:00:17,884
It again burns in
the fire of love.

722
01:00:18,962 --> 01:00:22,557
God, be kind.

723
01:00:23,166 --> 01:00:24,895
God, be kind.

724
01:00:25,235 --> 01:00:27,430
God, be kind.

725
01:00:27,504 --> 01:00:29,165
God, be kind.

726
01:00:29,439 --> 01:00:31,430
God, be kind.

727
01:00:31,908 --> 01:00:33,375
God, be kind.

728
01:00:34,110 --> 01:00:36,578
God, be kind.

729
01:00:36,913 --> 01:00:39,245
Heart is afraid of fire.

730
01:00:41,051 --> 01:00:43,986
It again burns in
the fire of love.

731
01:00:45,388 --> 01:00:48,585
Heart is afraid of fire.

732
01:00:49,926 --> 01:00:52,986
It again burns in
the fire of love.

733
01:00:53,596 --> 01:00:55,393
God, be kind.

734
01:00:55,865 --> 01:00:57,389
God, be kind.

735
01:00:58,001 --> 01:00:59,468
God, be kind.

736
01:00:59,869 --> 01:01:02,269
God, be kind.

737
01:01:02,339 --> 01:01:04,000
God, be kind.

738
01:01:04,341 --> 01:01:06,138
God, be kind.

739
01:01:06,543 --> 01:01:08,340
God, be kind.

740
01:01:08,611 --> 01:01:11,273
God, be kind.

741
01:01:37,374 --> 01:01:39,934
In the morning it can't wake up.

742
01:01:40,010 --> 01:01:42,308
No conch can wake it.

743
01:01:45,982 --> 01:01:48,382
In the morning it can't wake up.

744
01:01:48,518 --> 01:01:50,452
No conch can wake it.

745
01:01:50,587 --> 01:01:53,112
But it doesn't
sleep the whole night.

746
01:01:54,958 --> 01:01:57,392
But it doesn't
sleep the whole night.

747
01:01:57,460 --> 01:01:59,451
When somebody
dwells in those eyes.

748
01:01:59,596 --> 01:02:01,461
When somebody
dwells in those eyes.

749
01:02:01,531 --> 01:02:03,055
God, be kind.

750
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:05,061
God, be kind.

751
01:02:05,535 --> 01:02:07,196
God, be kind.

752
01:02:07,470 --> 01:02:09,995
God, be kind.

753
01:02:10,273 --> 01:02:11,399
God!

754
01:02:11,941 --> 01:02:13,533
God!

755
01:02:14,277 --> 01:02:16,074
God, be kind.

756
01:02:16,279 --> 01:02:19,009
God, be kind.

757
01:02:36,566 --> 01:02:40,002
Even flying saucer can't fly.

758
01:02:41,037 --> 01:02:43,699
The way thoughts fly.

759
01:02:45,508 --> 01:02:47,567
Even flying saucer can't fly.

760
01:02:47,644 --> 01:02:49,441
The way thoughts fly.

761
01:02:49,712 --> 01:02:52,044
Be it dawn or dusk.

762
01:02:52,115 --> 01:02:53,707
It goes and meets its beloved.

763
01:02:54,117 --> 01:02:56,244
Be it dawn or dusk.

764
01:02:56,319 --> 01:02:58,014
It goes and meets its beloved.

765
01:02:58,521 --> 01:03:00,011
It goes and meets its beloved.

766
01:03:00,256 --> 01:03:01,723
God, be kind.

767
01:03:02,125 --> 01:03:04,025
God, be kind.

768
01:03:04,394 --> 01:03:06,123
God, be kind.

769
01:03:06,463 --> 01:03:07,589
God!

770
01:03:08,665 --> 01:03:09,723
God, be kind.

771
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:12,661
God, be kind.

772
01:03:13,069 --> 01:03:15,037
God, be kind.

773
01:03:15,338 --> 01:03:18,205
God, be kind.

774
01:03:18,341 --> 01:03:21,037
Heart is afraid of fire.

775
01:03:22,545 --> 01:03:25,275
It again burns in
the fire of love.

776
01:03:26,749 --> 01:03:29,081
Heart is afraid of fire.

777
01:03:31,154 --> 01:03:34,612
It again burns in
the fire of love.

778
01:03:35,091 --> 01:03:36,752
God, be kind.

779
01:03:37,160 --> 01:03:38,752
God, be kind.

780
01:03:39,496 --> 01:03:41,157
God, be kind.

781
01:03:43,633 --> 01:03:45,624
God, be kind.

782
01:03:45,768 --> 01:03:47,565
God, be kind.

783
01:03:48,037 --> 01:03:49,766
God, be kind.

784
01:03:50,173 --> 01:03:52,767
God, be kind.

785
01:04:47,497 --> 01:04:48,828
Brother! How are you?

786
01:04:49,832 --> 01:04:51,697
I took medicine. Now I am fine.

787
01:04:54,637 --> 01:04:55,695
Whose plan is this?

788
01:04:55,838 --> 01:05:00,172
Vicky says that he saw
Dara running away for sure.

789
01:05:00,577 --> 01:05:02,101
I am not asking the name
of the man who did it...

790
01:05:02,178 --> 01:05:03,509
...but the person who planned it.

791
01:05:03,780 --> 01:05:06,374
Nab Dara. He will reveal everything.

792
01:05:06,783 --> 01:05:07,841
Where will I find him?

793
01:05:08,117 --> 01:05:09,175
He was shot.

794
01:05:09,319 --> 01:05:10,377
I have received the news that he...

795
01:05:10,453 --> 01:05:11,852
...is being treated is
at Holy Family hospital.

796
01:05:12,722 --> 01:05:17,182
You rest. We will do
something to nab him.

797
01:05:58,568 --> 01:06:00,195
Now what's your use?

798
01:06:02,905 --> 01:06:06,204
Kill me! Kill me!
What else can you do?

799
01:06:06,442 --> 01:06:07,500
Boss!

800
01:06:07,577 --> 01:06:09,511
I did what I had to do!

801
01:06:09,646 --> 01:06:12,206
Now you people can
do whatever you want!

802
01:06:14,183 --> 01:06:15,514
Why did you join Goonga?

803
01:06:15,785 --> 01:06:17,719
Who are you to ask me?

804
01:06:18,788 --> 01:06:23,191
This idiot made me run bare
on the streets of Mumbai...

805
01:06:23,259 --> 01:06:26,592
...where I used to
walk proudly! Proudly!

806
01:06:28,598 --> 01:06:29,929
I joined Goonga!

807
01:06:31,267 --> 01:06:35,260
You too used to swear on
friendship in Nagpada.

808
01:06:35,338 --> 01:06:39,240
I will... I should have
killed you there itself!

809
01:06:39,942 --> 01:06:41,239
Time has changed, Dara.

810
01:06:41,678 --> 01:06:42,804
But this didn't change!

811
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:47,941
What you have in your hand,
it will remain the same.

812
01:06:49,352 --> 01:06:50,410
RD!

813
01:06:51,421 --> 01:06:53,821
In these 18 years you have known...

814
01:06:53,890 --> 01:06:55,824
...that I don't care
for money or the gang!

815
01:06:56,225 --> 01:06:57,283
Right?

816
01:06:57,360 --> 01:06:58,418
Yes.

817
01:06:58,494 --> 01:07:02,260
I just wanted to settle
scores with Amaan Ali!

818
01:07:02,432 --> 01:07:05,367
So why are you
teaching me discourses here?

819
01:07:05,835 --> 01:07:10,966
You are Mumbai police's backbone.

820
01:07:13,309 --> 01:07:14,970
I respect you a lot.

821
01:07:15,445 --> 01:07:17,913
Every dog respects bone.

822
01:07:43,005 --> 01:07:46,873
He was a nice officer.
He just went a bit astray.

823
01:07:54,951 --> 01:07:57,010
This!

824
01:08:02,024 --> 01:08:03,958
Another flop!

825
01:08:06,362 --> 01:08:08,694
Goonga is going on
giving just flops.

826
01:08:09,499 --> 01:08:12,434
None of your ideas
is yielding result.

827
01:08:12,835 --> 01:08:14,393
I was born with bad luck.

828
01:08:14,504 --> 01:08:15,766
Mind your tongue!

829
01:08:15,838 --> 01:08:16,896
You keep quiet!

830
01:08:19,041 --> 01:08:22,033
I am mad! You need to be
sentimental during such a time!

831
01:08:22,311 --> 01:08:23,369
Don't interfere!

832
01:08:23,513 --> 01:08:24,571
What is this? What?

833
01:08:24,981 --> 01:08:28,348
What is Ali! RD! What? Just nothing!

834
01:08:29,385 --> 01:08:30,511
I am powerful!

835
01:08:30,987 --> 01:08:32,648
And we... in between.

836
01:08:33,055 --> 01:08:34,920
Don't talk too much!

837
01:08:35,658 --> 01:08:37,455
Did I plan the idea
thinking it will be a flop?

838
01:08:37,994 --> 01:08:39,052
I too have brains!

839
01:08:39,395 --> 01:08:41,056
I told you to keep quiet!

840
01:08:41,531 --> 01:08:42,657
Now you will give me a lecture!

841
01:08:42,732 --> 01:08:43,790
You keep quiet!

842
01:08:43,866 --> 01:08:45,333
I don't have brains!
You too say this!

843
01:08:45,468 --> 01:08:46,867
Why do you talk...
- Quiet! Quiet!

844
01:08:46,936 --> 01:08:47,994
Quiet!

845
01:08:52,675 --> 01:08:54,006
You trust me, don't you?

846
01:08:55,478 --> 01:08:56,536
Tell me!

847
01:09:01,617 --> 01:09:04,950
I will do. I will plan another idea.

848
01:09:14,430 --> 01:09:17,695
Sir, the goods will be
unloaded at Silgrik area in Gujarat.

849
01:09:23,573 --> 01:09:24,631
Yes.

850
01:09:26,976 --> 01:09:28,034
Okay!

851
01:09:30,713 --> 01:09:31,839
Whom were you talking with?

852
01:09:34,517 --> 01:09:35,643
It's a secret.

853
01:09:37,453 --> 01:09:38,511
What secret?

854
01:09:39,655 --> 01:09:41,850
If I told you, it
won't remain a secret.

855
01:09:43,860 --> 01:09:45,657
Do you know what your problem is?

856
01:09:46,529 --> 01:09:47,587
What?

857
01:09:47,797 --> 01:09:51,426
Too good! You are too good!

858
01:09:56,005 --> 01:09:57,063
I know!

859
01:10:07,083 --> 01:10:10,143
Thanks for saving
brother's life, hero.

860
01:10:13,756 --> 01:10:14,814
What happened?

861
01:10:17,159 --> 01:10:20,151
Somebody else too used
to call me by this name.

862
01:10:21,697 --> 01:10:23,756
Hero!
- Yes.

863
01:10:24,967 --> 01:10:26,025
Who?

864
01:10:27,503 --> 01:10:28,561
It's a secret.

865
01:10:35,728 --> 01:10:38,993
Our Gujarat's assignment was seized.

866
01:10:40,066 --> 01:10:41,397
I think somebody
leaked the information.

867
01:10:44,937 --> 01:10:48,464
I think there is
another person in the gang.

868
01:10:51,410 --> 01:10:52,468
What do you think?

869
01:11:01,020 --> 01:11:02,078
It's not necessary!

870
01:11:02,755 --> 01:11:04,746
Out of 20 times, we
are right 19 times.

871
01:11:05,825 --> 01:11:07,087
And once the police.

872
01:11:07,293 --> 01:11:10,751
It's such a big department.
Give some credit.

873
01:11:10,830 --> 01:11:12,354
Next time we will be more careful.

874
01:11:12,765 --> 01:11:13,823
RD!

875
01:11:26,045 --> 01:11:27,774
Amaan!
- Yes.

876
01:11:28,915 --> 01:11:34,319
I don't know why
nowadays I think only about you.

877
01:11:35,388 --> 01:11:39,381
Because... I am worthy of that.

878
01:11:41,260 --> 01:11:42,318
Right!

879
01:11:43,262 --> 01:11:44,320
Just joking!

880
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:03,815
Those two men in the photos are...

881
01:12:03,883 --> 01:12:05,817
...Noor Hamza and Zahwari.

882
01:12:06,285 --> 01:12:07,946
They are closest to Sultan.

883
01:12:08,020 --> 01:12:10,818
Now we have strong evidence that...

884
01:12:10,890 --> 01:12:13,085
...Sultan and RD have joined hands.

885
01:12:13,159 --> 01:12:15,957
I will try to gather
information about Sultan and RD!

886
01:12:19,832 --> 01:12:21,026
Traitor!

887
01:12:34,046 --> 01:12:35,172
Listen to me carefully!

888
01:12:35,581 --> 01:12:37,515
I will call you from another number!

889
01:12:38,117 --> 01:12:39,175
Answer the call!

890
01:12:44,857 --> 01:12:46,848
Now you will get another
call from this number.

891
01:12:47,460 --> 01:12:49,451
Answer the call and
identity Karim Ali.

892
01:13:05,144 --> 01:13:08,272
He tried to shoot me! I killed him!

893
01:13:09,015 --> 01:13:10,073
Why?

894
01:13:10,149 --> 01:13:13,880
He was telling the police officer
about the failed attack on Goonga.

895
01:13:13,953 --> 01:13:15,352
Coincidentally I heard it.

896
01:13:16,289 --> 01:13:17,950
He took out the gun.

897
01:13:18,958 --> 01:13:20,016
And...

898
01:13:23,362 --> 01:13:26,297
Allwyn! Pick up his phone!

899
01:13:44,183 --> 01:13:45,241
Tell me, Karim!

900
01:14:05,604 --> 01:14:06,662
Fine!

901
01:14:09,342 --> 01:14:10,934
Ahmad Hussain is chief
investigating officer...

902
01:14:11,010 --> 01:14:13,069
...of special cell in Mumbai.

903
01:14:13,212 --> 01:14:14,270
I told you!

904
01:14:15,348 --> 01:14:17,145
That Goonga is giving
information to the police!

905
01:14:17,216 --> 01:14:18,547
And Karim too!

906
01:14:18,684 --> 01:14:21,278
I never thought that Karim
will turn out like this!

907
01:14:21,554 --> 01:14:24,022
RD, you helped him so much.

908
01:14:27,293 --> 01:14:29,955
This is the difference
between men and dog.

909
01:14:30,029 --> 01:14:33,226
Its time to kill
Goonga and not to talk!

910
01:14:33,632 --> 01:14:34,690
Yes!

911
01:14:34,967 --> 01:14:39,301
Goonga lives on a boat out of fear.

912
01:14:39,572 --> 01:14:40,630
On a boat?

913
01:14:40,706 --> 01:14:42,970
He is afraid that if he
stayed at a fixed place...

914
01:14:43,042 --> 01:14:45,567
...then we will be fond out.

915
01:14:45,644 --> 01:14:48,169
That's why he lives on
a boat in the ocean.

916
01:14:48,247 --> 01:14:49,714
It's always sailing.

917
01:14:49,982 --> 01:14:52,712
If somebody comes near...
then he can be seen from far.

918
01:14:53,986 --> 01:14:57,444
IB is backing Goonga.

919
01:14:57,990 --> 01:14:59,048
IB?

920
01:14:59,392 --> 01:15:00,654
Intelligence Bureau!

921
01:15:02,661 --> 01:15:05,459
Goonga is being paid
for being my enemy.

922
01:15:06,999 --> 01:15:12,062
IB thinks that Goonga is
the only medium to kill me.

923
01:15:16,008 --> 01:15:21,002
The only difference
between me and Goonga is that...

924
01:15:21,080 --> 01:15:26,017
...I am with Sultan and
Goonga is with the government.

925
01:15:28,354 --> 01:15:29,412
It's possible.

926
01:15:30,022 --> 01:15:33,014
As they are very secretive...

927
01:15:33,092 --> 01:15:36,027
...lB doesn't take
us into confidence.

928
01:15:36,095 --> 01:15:42,034
And its also possible
that Goonga is being used...

929
01:15:42,101 --> 01:15:47,630
...to curb RD's
underworld and Sultan's terrorism.

930
01:15:48,040 --> 01:15:51,032
If IB is with Goonga... then
they too will come in between...

931
01:15:51,110 --> 01:15:53,578
...during the attack.

932
01:15:54,046 --> 01:15:57,709
Fire brigade and ambulance...
never stop at any signal.

933
01:15:59,585 --> 01:16:02,053
You have gone there
for the common people...

934
01:16:02,121 --> 01:16:03,713
...and not for the government.

935
01:16:04,056 --> 01:16:08,322
We don't value
anybody's life in our duty.

936
01:16:08,661 --> 01:16:11,061
Neither mine nor yours.

937
01:16:13,199 --> 01:16:18,603
Remember... work is
more important than life.

938
01:16:20,473 --> 01:16:23,067
There is something in
you which stops you...

939
01:16:23,142 --> 01:16:25,076
...from getting close to anybody.

940
01:16:25,544 --> 01:16:27,205
I am scared of losing relationships.

941
01:16:29,081 --> 01:16:30,742
You never lose anything, Amaan.

942
01:16:32,551 --> 01:16:36,146
Everything comes back
in a different form.

943
01:16:40,493 --> 01:16:43,087
Iya, have you ever loved somebody?

944
01:16:46,765 --> 01:16:48,357
Yes. I have.

945
01:16:49,101 --> 01:16:50,159
Whom?

946
01:16:51,437 --> 01:16:52,495
You.

947
01:16:54,440 --> 01:16:56,237
Me? Why?

948
01:16:57,376 --> 01:16:58,434
It's a secret.

949
01:17:04,450 --> 01:17:06,111
We know where Goonga is.

950
01:17:10,122 --> 01:17:13,455
Along with Amaan, I too
am going to kill Goonga.

951
01:17:18,130 --> 01:17:19,188
Why?

952
01:17:20,132 --> 01:17:22,396
Because I love Amaan.

953
01:17:25,804 --> 01:17:27,601
And I want to be with him.

954
01:17:45,357 --> 01:17:46,551
When are you guys leaving?

955
01:17:48,694 --> 01:17:49,752
What have you decided?

956
01:17:51,497 --> 01:17:52,555
About what?

957
01:17:53,766 --> 01:17:56,894
What I told RD about you.

958
01:17:57,436 --> 01:17:59,165
What is there to think?
- What do you mean?

959
01:18:00,839 --> 01:18:01,897
I love you too.

960
01:18:02,174 --> 01:18:03,232
Really?

961
01:18:05,177 --> 01:18:06,235
It's a secret.

962
01:18:11,383 --> 01:18:12,441
It will be fun.

963
01:18:12,785 --> 01:18:13,843
What?

964
01:18:13,919 --> 01:18:16,387
I have thought of
something to kill Goonga.

965
01:18:17,456 --> 01:18:20,721
You are mad.
- I am Iya.

966
01:18:21,527 --> 01:18:23,188
Divya!
- Who?

967
01:18:24,196 --> 01:18:26,596
Your name. To gain
entry in the hotel.

968
01:18:26,932 --> 01:18:28,194
Divya.

969
01:18:28,534 --> 01:18:29,592
Divya, Amaan.

970
01:18:33,339 --> 01:18:34,397
Yes.

971
01:18:38,210 --> 01:18:39,802
Amaan.
- Yes.

972
01:18:41,547 --> 01:18:44,607
I know who your secret is.

973
01:18:47,486 --> 01:18:50,887
Who?
- Divya.

974
01:18:55,694 --> 01:18:58,288
You broke up with your secret?

975
01:19:02,234 --> 01:19:03,292
Then?

976
01:19:04,236 --> 01:19:05,294
She died.

977
01:19:06,905 --> 01:19:08,236
Is this a joke?

978
01:19:09,708 --> 01:19:10,766
Yes.

979
01:19:13,846 --> 01:19:19,375
In jest, we too have come so close.

980
01:19:23,255 --> 01:19:24,517
It's better to be distant.

981
01:19:24,990 --> 01:19:26,924
I will give only pain.

982
01:19:30,529 --> 01:19:35,728
You did say. You
like to make people cry.

983
01:19:38,871 --> 01:19:41,806
I accept everything that you give.

984
01:19:52,818 --> 01:19:53,876
Yes.

985
01:20:02,294 --> 01:20:03,556
Found Goonga's whereabouts.

986
01:20:12,304 --> 01:20:15,296
Yes! So what? You should do it!

987
01:20:15,574 --> 01:20:19,374
Yes! Fool!

988
01:20:19,978 --> 01:20:21,707
Goonga!
- Yes!

989
01:20:22,915 --> 01:20:23,973
Do you remember?

990
01:20:24,650 --> 01:20:27,312
When you murdered Ghanshyam...

991
01:20:27,386 --> 01:20:28,978
Who?
- That jeweller.

992
01:20:29,321 --> 01:20:30,379
Yes.

993
01:20:30,456 --> 01:20:33,323
With the extortion money
you got from his son...

994
01:20:33,392 --> 01:20:35,519
...you said you will get me
a necklace worth 9 lakhs.

995
01:20:35,994 --> 01:20:42,593
You know that nowadays a lot of
money is needed to run the gang.

996
01:20:44,470 --> 01:20:49,999
The government is taking
months to give IB's money.

997
01:20:52,344 --> 01:20:53,675
You don't worry.

998
01:20:53,812 --> 01:20:58,340
After RD's death I will be
Mumbai's king number one.

999
01:20:58,684 --> 01:20:59,742
Yes!

1000
01:21:01,620 --> 01:21:03,349
Forget necklace worth 9 lakhs.

1001
01:21:03,422 --> 01:21:06,357
I will get necklace
worth 90 lakhs for you.

1002
01:21:07,559 --> 01:21:09,356
Will you give me earrings too?
- Yes.

1003
01:21:13,365 --> 01:21:14,423
Who is this person?

1004
01:22:37,516 --> 01:22:40,041
Excuse me! Can I have some water?

1005
01:22:42,054 --> 01:22:44,045
Give her coke.

1006
01:23:24,830 --> 01:23:27,822
I will gift such a
scooter boat to you. - To me?

1007
01:23:27,900 --> 01:23:28,958
I will ride it?

1008
01:23:29,034 --> 01:23:30,501
Yes! Then you too ride it!

1009
01:23:31,503 --> 01:23:32,561
Hey! Hey!

1010
01:23:33,505 --> 01:23:36,030
Come on! Come on!

1011
01:23:39,511 --> 01:23:41,502
Come on, hurry up.

1012
01:23:47,786 --> 01:23:51,517
Run, this way!
- Come on, everybody.

1013
01:23:54,192 --> 01:24:00,188
Don't go! Don't go! Don't go!
- Leave me!

1014
01:24:01,133 --> 01:24:04,261
I won't spare him!
I won't spare him!

1015
01:24:12,077 --> 01:24:14,545
Hey Raja!

1016
01:24:16,949 --> 01:24:18,007
Don't go!

1017
01:24:18,083 --> 01:24:20,551
I won't spare anybody!

1018
01:24:20,619 --> 01:24:22,553
Don't go!
- Move!

1019
01:24:23,822 --> 01:24:27,690
I will kill everybody!
I will kill everybody!

1020
01:24:37,569 --> 01:24:40,766
Don't go!
- Move!

1021
01:24:40,839 --> 01:24:43,171
Don't go!

1022
01:24:43,241 --> 01:24:44,765
Come inside! Come inside!
- Leave me!

1023
01:24:44,843 --> 01:24:48,574
Mirchi! I won't
spare anybody! Leave me!

1024
01:24:48,647 --> 01:24:51,980
Hey, where is it!

1025
01:24:52,050 --> 01:24:53,915
Here it is. Found it.

1026
01:24:53,986 --> 01:24:56,113
Here it is. Found it.

1027
01:24:56,588 --> 01:24:57,782
Goonga! Take this...

1028
01:25:47,639 --> 01:25:52,042
What have you done to yourself?

1029
01:27:40,886 --> 01:27:42,854
You should have a goal in life.

1030
01:27:44,823 --> 01:27:46,120
There should be something new.

1031
01:27:47,292 --> 01:27:50,284
Bungalow, car, girl, money.

1032
01:27:51,296 --> 01:27:53,764
Since childhood
whatever I dreamed of...

1033
01:27:53,832 --> 01:27:56,824
...I had it to my heart's content.

1034
01:27:57,135 --> 01:27:58,193
Now what more to have?

1035
01:27:58,303 --> 01:27:59,770
When you don't
have any destination...

1036
01:27:59,838 --> 01:28:04,400
...then its better to accept
the path shown by somebody else.

1037
01:28:07,312 --> 01:28:10,213
I made Sultan's aim my aim.

1038
01:28:14,219 --> 01:28:16,050
Today you are my most special man.

1039
01:28:17,923 --> 01:28:19,982
And I have said this to Sultan too.

1040
01:28:20,325 --> 01:28:22,885
Sultan is hatching
some plan for Mumbai.

1041
01:28:23,161 --> 01:28:25,220
What is it? He didn't even tell me.

1042
01:28:25,363 --> 01:28:27,797
He needs a man who knows the area...

1043
01:28:27,866 --> 01:28:29,891
...thoroughly, for supervision.

1044
01:28:30,268 --> 01:28:33,897
He should be capable. I
have recommended your name.

1045
01:28:34,072 --> 01:28:37,872
Do quietly whatever Sultan says.

1046
01:28:40,879 --> 01:28:43,313
Hamza is Sultan's special man.

1047
01:28:44,983 --> 01:28:47,816
Take RDX and with
Hamza and his men...

1048
01:28:47,886 --> 01:28:53,290
...leave for Mumbai by the
sea route tomorrow night.

1049
01:28:53,491 --> 01:28:55,186
Bhansali will pick you up.

1050
01:28:55,861 --> 01:28:59,297
And from there he will
take you people to Sultan.

1051
01:29:09,841 --> 01:29:10,899
Sir!

1052
01:29:11,009 --> 01:29:12,567
Don't give me any bad news.

1053
01:29:13,445 --> 01:29:15,470
I don't have time
for trivial problems.

1054
01:29:15,914 --> 01:29:16,972
It's a grave problem, sir.

1055
01:29:17,182 --> 01:29:19,582
I can't trust anybody.

1056
01:29:21,386 --> 01:29:24,913
Not even the commissioner.
That's why I came to you.

1057
01:29:25,123 --> 01:29:27,853
I have received confirmed
information from an informer...

1058
01:29:27,926 --> 01:29:31,521
...that Sultan is coming to Mumbai.

1059
01:29:32,030 --> 01:29:34,225
He is planning something big.

1060
01:29:35,333 --> 01:29:37,233
I have spoken to the Home Minister.

1061
01:29:37,435 --> 01:29:40,233
And he has promised
to help in every way.

1062
01:29:40,906 --> 01:29:42,874
When you people reach Mumbai...

1063
01:29:42,941 --> 01:29:46,502
...I and my team will
follow you people.

1064
01:29:46,611 --> 01:29:51,207
When you reach Sultan...
we will arrest everybody.

1065
01:29:55,220 --> 01:29:56,949
RD!
- Yes.

1066
01:29:57,923 --> 01:30:00,517
I am going to Mumbai with Amaan.

1067
01:30:09,968 --> 01:30:11,026
It's dangerous.

1068
01:30:13,238 --> 01:30:15,900
The day we entered this profession...

1069
01:30:15,974 --> 01:30:17,339
...that day, we died.

1070
01:30:40,265 --> 01:30:41,323
Take care of her.

1071
01:31:10,028 --> 01:31:16,024
Twinkle, twinkle little star.

1072
01:31:16,701 --> 01:31:22,401
How I wonder what you are!

1073
01:31:23,341 --> 01:31:30,270
Up above the world so high.

1074
01:31:30,982 --> 01:31:38,411
Plant a bomb.

1075
01:31:40,725 --> 01:31:42,283
We used to live in a shanty.

1076
01:31:44,562 --> 01:31:45,620
I was 6 years old.

1077
01:31:46,531 --> 01:31:48,089
Brother was 13 years old.

1078
01:31:48,633 --> 01:31:55,197
When life is ruined then
there is no right or wrong.

1079
01:31:58,176 --> 01:32:03,113
We didn't come to know...
when the paths changed.

1080
01:32:06,184 --> 01:32:11,019
Brother said, Iya, in this world,
only that man can survive...

1081
01:32:11,089 --> 01:32:15,025
...who can either
dominate the other person...

1082
01:32:15,093 --> 01:32:16,583
...or kill him.

1083
01:32:27,405 --> 01:32:32,240
Amaan... will you
take me to your house?

1084
01:32:32,710 --> 01:32:34,041
I don't have any house.

1085
01:32:36,081 --> 01:32:37,412
Again dialogue.

1086
01:32:38,583 --> 01:32:41,677
Where you are...
that is house for me.

1087
01:32:42,120 --> 01:32:43,644
I am the police's man.

1088
01:32:47,125 --> 01:32:51,425
Twinkle, twinkle little star.

1089
01:32:51,496 --> 01:32:54,590
Iya, I am really the police's man.

1090
01:32:56,134 --> 01:32:59,069
Twinkle, twinkle...

1091
01:32:59,204 --> 01:33:04,506
I have betrayed!
- Whom? RD?

1092
01:33:05,076 --> 01:33:06,134
Yes.

1093
01:33:13,485 --> 01:33:17,581
Iya, I am really the police's man!

1094
01:33:19,390 --> 01:33:20,516
I am the police's man!

1095
01:33:24,762 --> 01:33:31,463
My name is not Amaan...
but Aman... Aman Malik.

1096
01:33:49,120 --> 01:33:51,850
Ahmad Hussain gave a
new meaning to my life.

1097
01:33:57,829 --> 01:34:00,127
Today, I am telling
you this truth because...

1098
01:34:00,198 --> 01:34:03,861
...I don't want anything to
happen to you because of me.

1099
01:34:09,541 --> 01:34:12,135
A police team will follow us
when we will reach Mumbai.

1100
01:34:12,310 --> 01:34:16,406
And they will arrest
everybody when we will reach Sultan.

1101
01:34:18,516 --> 01:34:19,881
Now the decision is yours.

1102
01:34:20,185 --> 01:34:24,212
Either be on my side or...

1103
01:34:30,895 --> 01:34:35,195
It means to get Sultan...

1104
01:34:38,903 --> 01:34:40,427
...you can kill me too?

1105
01:34:47,178 --> 01:34:48,236
Even myself!

1106
01:34:49,781 --> 01:34:54,184
Iya, my life has only
one mission. Sultan!

1107
01:34:54,519 --> 01:34:59,252
Till date whatever I did, it
was just a means to get Sultan!

1108
01:35:00,225 --> 01:35:04,184
And not even once did...

1109
01:35:04,262 --> 01:35:08,198
...you think about me?

1110
01:35:09,834 --> 01:35:15,272
Water doesn't think.
It only paves its way.

1111
01:35:16,941 --> 01:35:19,205
The man who drowns in
that water, he thinks.

1112
01:35:21,946 --> 01:35:26,212
And all this... for the country?

1113
01:35:29,220 --> 01:35:30,278
Country?

1114
01:35:33,725 --> 01:35:35,955
Maybe I am still
searching for my answers.

1115
01:35:36,294 --> 01:35:40,424
But I do know that the country
begins with me and ends with me.

1116
01:35:41,966 --> 01:35:46,596
Iya, I am not doing all this for
money, fame, reputation, power.

1117
01:35:47,972 --> 01:35:49,496
I am doing it for my belief.

1118
01:35:51,609 --> 01:35:56,239
Sultan! Sultan is
the fear within me...

1119
01:35:56,314 --> 01:35:59,875
...with whom I am still fighting.

1120
01:35:59,984 --> 01:36:02,612
My battle is not with Sultan.
It's with my own self.

1121
01:36:04,589 --> 01:36:06,250
And Islam has taught me this much...

1122
01:36:06,324 --> 01:36:10,988
...that the war fought with
yourself is called Jihad (holy war).

1123
01:36:12,297 --> 01:36:18,258
And with my Jihad... I will destroy...

1124
01:36:18,336 --> 01:36:22,295
...Sultan and his thoughts.

1125
01:36:27,545 --> 01:36:32,278
But... RD says that...

1126
01:36:32,350 --> 01:36:35,376
...Sultan is Allah's devotee.

1127
01:36:35,653 --> 01:36:40,386
If he is Allah's devotee... then
why is he on the run like a thief?

1128
01:36:41,025 --> 01:36:42,322
He should attack openly!

1129
01:36:43,361 --> 01:36:44,885
If he is Allah's devotee then why...

1130
01:36:44,962 --> 01:36:46,020
...does he plant bombs like a coward!

1131
01:36:46,564 --> 01:36:48,293
If he is Allah's devotee then
why couldn't he save those...

1132
01:36:48,366 --> 01:36:49,731
...whom I killed?

1133
01:36:50,735 --> 01:36:55,832
Iya, your life and your
death lies in my hand!

1134
01:36:56,374 --> 01:36:59,309
Not Sultan but I am Allah's devotee!

1135
01:37:00,511 --> 01:37:04,971
Iya, I feel grief... but not regret.

1136
01:37:09,854 --> 01:37:14,484
And I feel grief... and regret too.

1137
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:25,833
I am with you, Aman.

1138
01:37:28,973 --> 01:37:30,065
Because you are my country.

1139
01:37:41,018 --> 01:37:43,953
Aman... Amaan...

1140
01:37:47,925 --> 01:37:49,449
...now it doesn't
make any difference.

1141
01:37:53,731 --> 01:38:00,728
Because I have loved you...
and not your name.

1142
01:38:03,374 --> 01:38:08,573
5 years ago when the
plan was hijacked...

1143
01:38:09,447 --> 01:38:10,744
I had done the deal.

1144
01:38:11,416 --> 01:38:15,546
I took such a big suitcase to
the plane to give to Sultan.

1145
01:38:18,756 --> 01:38:20,656
Since then I have known Sultan.

1146
01:38:23,394 --> 01:38:24,520
Cigar.

1147
01:38:26,397 --> 01:38:27,455
Me neither.

1148
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:32,458
I smoke in company.

1149
01:38:33,671 --> 01:38:36,037
I am the Home Minister.

1150
01:38:36,140 --> 01:38:39,405
But in politics our party
is the opposition party.

1151
01:38:39,744 --> 01:38:46,149
My son will stand
for the next elections.

1152
01:38:46,551 --> 01:38:53,480
I needed an issue for
the government's downfall.

1153
01:38:53,758 --> 01:38:58,422
An incident in which
many lives are lost...

1154
01:38:58,496 --> 01:39:01,431
...so that public
gets infuriated and...

1155
01:39:01,499 --> 01:39:04,468
...it leads to government's downfall.

1156
01:39:08,506 --> 01:39:11,873
I asked for Sultan's help.

1157
01:39:26,557 --> 01:39:29,048
But this Hussain!

1158
01:39:30,495 --> 01:39:31,723
What to do with him?

1159
01:39:33,698 --> 01:39:35,563
That's why I called you.

1160
01:39:53,217 --> 01:39:59,213
Reach Sewri landing area by
10 with Kannan and Masulkar.

1161
01:40:00,124 --> 01:40:03,218
Yes. Bhojnipur crossing.

1162
01:40:04,061 --> 01:40:05,585
Yes. On that milestone.

1163
01:40:06,163 --> 01:40:09,223
I will meet you there at 11.
Come in plain clothes.

1164
01:40:10,167 --> 01:40:11,600
Don't bring the department's car.

1165
01:40:43,100 --> 01:40:44,158
Stop the car!

1166
01:40:46,270 --> 01:40:47,737
What happened?
- Sorry, sir!

1167
01:43:13,350 --> 01:43:14,874
How are you?

1168
01:43:15,286 --> 01:43:17,277
RD has sent his greetings.

1169
01:43:21,025 --> 01:43:22,083
Yes.

1170
01:43:26,864 --> 01:43:27,922
Greetings.

1171
01:43:27,998 --> 01:43:30,330
This and there are
some in the car too.

1172
01:43:30,401 --> 01:43:31,959
Total must be around 500 kilos.

1173
01:43:54,058 --> 01:43:58,119
Amaan. Do you know its meaning?

1174
01:43:59,330 --> 01:44:06,793
Amaan means protection. Shelter.
Fearlessness.

1175
01:44:09,340 --> 01:44:12,070
Peace. Solace.

1176
01:44:13,811 --> 01:44:15,244
Harmony.

1177
01:44:21,252 --> 01:44:22,742
Amaan!

1178
01:44:26,290 --> 01:44:27,348
Frisk him!

1179
01:44:29,927 --> 01:44:31,155
Sultan! What is this?

1180
01:44:31,228 --> 01:44:35,824
How did Ahmad
Hussain find out our plan?

1181
01:44:42,373 --> 01:44:43,431
Ahmad Hussain who?

1182
01:45:15,139 --> 01:45:16,197
Recognised him?

1183
01:45:19,076 --> 01:45:20,134
No.

1184
01:45:22,379 --> 01:45:23,437
Look, Amaan.

1185
01:45:26,350 --> 01:45:28,545
I have learnt only two things.

1186
01:45:30,154 --> 01:45:31,553
To die and to kill.

1187
01:45:33,424 --> 01:45:38,157
If your truth lies in
between the two... then tell me.

1188
01:45:39,430 --> 01:45:41,364
How long have you
been working for him?

1189
01:45:43,400 --> 01:45:47,268
Ahmad Hussain! I
have heard this name!

1190
01:45:52,476 --> 01:45:55,104
But I am seeing him
today for the first time.

1191
01:45:56,513 --> 01:45:57,912
He is RD's enemy.

1192
01:45:59,183 --> 01:46:05,281
And the one who is RD's enemy...
he is my enemy.

1193
01:46:07,057 --> 01:46:12,017
Oh! So you are so loyal to RD.

1194
01:46:18,135 --> 01:46:19,329
So why did you kill him?

1195
01:46:27,211 --> 01:46:28,269
What?

1196
01:46:28,345 --> 01:46:31,212
Yesterday, after you both left,
a bomb exploded in your house.

1197
01:46:31,282 --> 01:46:34,945
Along with RD, Hanif,
Allwyn... all of them died.

1198
01:46:35,219 --> 01:46:37,312
Somebody had left a timer.

1199
01:46:37,388 --> 01:46:38,446
Who?
- You!

1200
01:46:39,957 --> 01:46:41,015
Me?

1201
01:46:43,093 --> 01:46:46,961
Are you sure that RD...

1202
01:46:47,231 --> 01:46:51,634
My men saw everybody's bodies.

1203
01:46:52,970 --> 01:46:54,494
Tell me. Why did you kill them?

1204
01:46:56,240 --> 01:46:57,298
Why will I kill RD?

1205
01:46:59,476 --> 01:47:00,602
Why will I kill him?

1206
01:47:01,445 --> 01:47:04,243
Everybody is dead.
Nobody is left besides you.

1207
01:47:04,315 --> 01:47:06,146
This is what even I want to know.

1208
01:47:07,384 --> 01:47:08,442
Who killed him?

1209
01:47:20,531 --> 01:47:23,659
No! It can't be Amaan.

1210
01:47:29,106 --> 01:47:30,164
It's somebody else!

1211
01:47:31,008 --> 01:47:33,442
RD has countless enemies!
It could be anybody!

1212
01:47:34,278 --> 01:47:35,609
It can't be Amaan!

1213
01:47:38,515 --> 01:47:40,676
Are you sure it can't be him?

1214
01:47:42,286 --> 01:47:43,583
Do you trust him?

1215
01:47:45,222 --> 01:47:46,587
Why will he kill RD?

1216
01:47:47,291 --> 01:47:48,952
If Amaan had killed
RD then why would he...

1217
01:47:49,026 --> 01:47:51,017
...be here with us?

1218
01:47:52,029 --> 01:47:55,965
Amaan... Amaan was very loyal to RD.

1219
01:47:59,536 --> 01:48:05,031
It can't be Amaan!
It can't be Amaan!

1220
01:48:08,445 --> 01:48:09,503
It can't be Amaan!

1221
01:48:13,584 --> 01:48:16,712
No! It can't be Amaan!

1222
01:48:22,059 --> 01:48:23,617
It can't be Amaan!

1223
01:48:28,565 --> 01:48:34,595
Then... how did he
find out about our plan?

1224
01:48:35,072 --> 01:48:36,130
From Karim Ali.

1225
01:48:37,608 --> 01:48:40,168
Karim Ali, who? RD did mention him.

1226
01:48:41,578 --> 01:48:43,739
That Karim Ali is
with this Ahmad Hussain.

1227
01:48:45,582 --> 01:48:47,072
Where is Karim Ali?

1228
01:48:48,619 --> 01:48:51,087
Amaan killed him.

1229
01:48:58,595 --> 01:49:00,756
Wait! What are you doing?

1230
01:49:01,365 --> 01:49:02,627
I am killing him! What else?

1231
01:49:02,699 --> 01:49:06,362
If you killed him then how
will you know who is the traitor?

1232
01:49:07,371 --> 01:49:12,468
I mean how can we say for
sure that it was Karim Ali?

1233
01:49:20,651 --> 01:49:24,553
Ahmad... you must have heard my name.

1234
01:49:26,390 --> 01:49:29,223
Tell me! Tell me!

1235
01:49:29,526 --> 01:49:31,790
Tell me! Who is the informer!
Tell me!

1236
01:49:34,665 --> 01:49:36,758
Tell me! Otherwise you will die!

1237
01:49:38,402 --> 01:49:41,428
Work is more important than life.

1238
01:49:44,408 --> 01:49:47,502
What? More important than work?

1239
01:49:48,679 --> 01:49:50,704
Work? What does he mean?

1240
01:49:52,516 --> 01:49:56,077
Work is more important than life.

1241
01:49:56,153 --> 01:49:57,347
What does he mean?

1242
01:50:01,658 --> 01:50:07,494
What does he mean? What is
he saying? More important...

1243
01:50:12,703 --> 01:50:14,796
What was the use of
keeping him alive?

1244
01:50:16,173 --> 01:50:17,697
Be it Karim Ali or somebody else.

1245
01:50:17,774 --> 01:50:18,832
What difference does it makes?

1246
01:50:20,177 --> 01:50:23,169
As it is, our work
will be done by tomorrow.

1247
01:50:23,680 --> 01:50:28,117
Home Minister told
me and my commander...

1248
01:50:28,185 --> 01:50:35,284
...that Ahmad Hussain didn't
reveal our plan to anybody.

1249
01:50:35,559 --> 01:50:37,459
Pardon me, my friend.

1250
01:50:40,664 --> 01:50:42,131
I doubted you.

1251
01:50:55,746 --> 01:50:59,443
Which place is the
most crowded in Mumbai?

1252
01:50:59,650 --> 01:51:02,710
Railway stations. Shopping malls.

1253
01:51:03,220 --> 01:51:04,482
Children's school.

1254
01:51:11,495 --> 01:51:15,329
Amaan! You like children.

1255
01:51:20,504 --> 01:51:21,562
Yes.

1256
01:51:21,738 --> 01:51:24,400
But not more than
our Jihad (holy war).

1257
01:51:27,511 --> 01:51:34,246
School is the place where
betrayers' children learn.

1258
01:51:34,851 --> 01:51:37,251
Death is better
than wrong education.

1259
01:51:39,256 --> 01:51:43,716
Dying is not enough. There
should be fear of death.

1260
01:51:45,262 --> 01:51:50,461
If a tyre bursts then people
should feel as if bomb has exploded.

1261
01:51:51,768 --> 01:51:52,928
This is the task.

1262
01:51:59,810 --> 01:52:00,868
Amaan!

1263
01:52:01,545 --> 01:52:05,208
You keep a watch on those stations...

1264
01:52:05,282 --> 01:52:08,581
...which have
hospitals in the vicinity.

1265
01:52:09,553 --> 01:52:10,611
Why hospitals?

1266
01:52:10,754 --> 01:52:12,278
Bomb will explode at stations.

1267
01:52:16,560 --> 01:52:19,961
The wounded will reach the
hospital in an hour or so.

1268
01:52:20,230 --> 01:52:23,290
And then we will explode
the hospital using the timer.

1269
01:52:35,312 --> 01:52:38,406
What do the police do if they
find bomb in the cinema hall?

1270
01:52:39,816 --> 01:52:42,683
They vacate the
cinema for the checking.

1271
01:52:44,321 --> 01:52:47,256
If there is a bomb
in the hospital then...

1272
01:52:47,324 --> 01:52:50,316
...wounded people
won't be able to go in.

1273
01:52:51,595 --> 01:52:53,995
And those who are inside they too...

1274
01:53:03,607 --> 01:53:06,667
In the train, target
the ladies compartment.

1275
01:53:06,943 --> 01:53:10,777
There should be majority
of women and children.

1276
01:53:11,348 --> 01:53:13,578
Children take the
generation forward.

1277
01:53:13,650 --> 01:53:16,517
Body parts should fly in the air.

1278
01:53:20,891 --> 01:53:24,759
The roads should
be covered in blood.

1279
01:53:26,863 --> 01:53:32,631
Such a scene... that
everybody is stunned.

1280
01:53:32,703 --> 01:53:34,295
Those who don't die,
their eardrums...

1281
01:53:34,371 --> 01:53:36,032
...should get
damaged by the explosion.

1282
01:53:36,873 --> 01:53:38,033
There should be bodies all around.

1283
01:53:39,910 --> 01:53:42,777
Crying children! Wailing parents!

1284
01:55:52,042 --> 01:55:54,442
Did you kill RD?

1285
01:55:57,781 --> 01:56:00,147
You had a motive.

1286
01:56:06,923 --> 01:56:07,981
I had it.

1287
01:56:11,061 --> 01:56:14,861
So did you kill him?

1288
01:56:19,469 --> 01:56:20,527
No.

1289
01:56:30,814 --> 01:56:31,872
Control room.

1290
01:57:01,211 --> 01:57:04,738
Today, Mumbai police
stopped a big terrorist attack.

1291
01:57:04,948 --> 01:57:07,508
As per the agencies
this evening, this gang...

1292
01:57:07,584 --> 01:57:09,950
...was going to explode
bombs all over Mumbai.

1293
01:57:10,020 --> 01:57:13,046
Around 1000 kgs of RDX was found.

1294
01:57:13,123 --> 01:57:14,522
As per the sources the
ringleader of this gang...

1295
01:57:14,591 --> 01:57:17,025
...is Amaan Ali Khan.

1296
01:57:17,093 --> 01:57:20,062
Bharat Bushan the home
minister died in a terrorist attack.

1297
01:57:20,130 --> 01:57:22,530
Amaan Ali, who did all this,
is absconding.

1298
01:57:22,599 --> 01:57:24,533
Today at 2 there was a
powerful bomb blast...

1299
01:57:24,601 --> 01:57:27,092
...in the lift of Bharat
Bushan's personal office.

1300
01:57:27,170 --> 01:57:29,730
He died on the spot.

1301
01:57:29,806 --> 01:57:32,536
Another sensational news
from the sources is that...

1302
01:57:32,609 --> 01:57:35,544
...Amaan Ali is
such a dangerous man...

1303
01:57:35,612 --> 01:57:37,546
...he is such a traitor that
to take his boss RD's place...

1304
01:57:37,614 --> 01:57:39,946
...he even killed RD.

1305
01:57:40,016 --> 01:57:45,283
He became a gangster and then
this country's biggest enemy.

1306
01:57:45,622 --> 01:57:48,557
The biggest terrorist,
the one who died.

1307
01:57:48,892 --> 01:57:51,554
Million of people of this
country should question themselves...

1308
01:57:51,628 --> 01:57:56,292
...as Aman Ali is one
amongst them. Think it over.

1309
01:57:56,633 --> 01:58:00,694
After Sultan, Amaan Ali has
snatched the harmony of this country.

1310
01:58:00,904 --> 01:58:02,565
Aman! I don't
understand why don't you...

1311
01:58:02,639 --> 01:58:04,630
...tell the police everything?

1312
01:58:06,643 --> 01:58:08,133
What will be the use?

1313
01:58:10,981 --> 01:58:13,108
Aman Ali will become a hero!

1314
01:58:14,150 --> 01:58:15,310
And Amaan?

1315
01:58:18,188 --> 01:58:19,951
Amaan Ali will die forever.

1316
01:58:21,925 --> 01:58:23,984
Aman's life will not
be useful to anybody.

1317
01:58:25,195 --> 01:58:28,596
But Amaan... he has the chance...

1318
01:58:28,665 --> 01:58:32,931
...to get to the other
people above Sultan.

1319
01:58:36,673 --> 01:58:38,800
Sultan is just one
branch of the tree.

1320
01:58:40,176 --> 01:58:42,337
I want to uproot the entire tree!

1321
01:58:44,948 --> 01:58:46,677
Only then will my contract end.

1322
01:59:39,002 --> 01:59:41,061
Every death is dear to harmony.

1323
01:59:41,137 --> 01:59:43,731
Our business is to kill.

1324
01:59:43,807 --> 01:59:46,037
Blood flows in the vein.

1325
01:59:46,109 --> 01:59:48,737
It's important to shed blood.

1326
01:59:49,746 --> 01:59:51,680

1327
01:59:51,748 --> 01:59:53,739
Our business is to kill.

1328
01:59:54,017 --> 01:59:56,383
Blood flows in the vein.

1329
01:59:56,453 --> 01:59:59,115

It's important to shed blood.

1338
02:01:11,361 --> 02:01:13,829
