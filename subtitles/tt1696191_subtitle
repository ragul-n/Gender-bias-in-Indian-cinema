1
00:01:03,443 --> 00:01:06,412
Your and my nuptial rounds.

2
00:01:07,047 --> 00:01:10,574
Your and my nuptial rounds.

3
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:14,313
Your and my nuptial rounds.

4
00:01:14,554 --> 00:01:17,921
Your and my nuptial rounds.

5
00:01:17,991 --> 00:01:21,927
Your and my nuptial rounds.

6
00:01:21,995 --> 00:01:26,432
Your and my nuptial rounds.

7
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,305
Well, dude. I don't like marriage.

8
00:01:35,375 --> 00:01:37,036
It sounds to me devastation.

9
00:01:37,277 --> 00:01:38,904
Why to invite this
unnecessary trouble?

10
00:01:38,979 --> 00:01:40,879
It's better to remain single.

11
00:01:40,947 --> 00:01:42,676
It's time to run for the party.

12
00:01:42,749 --> 00:01:44,580
With some hot chicks and whiskey.

13
00:01:44,651 --> 00:01:46,278
Life will be great.

14
00:01:46,353 --> 00:01:47,980
There will be full merriment.

15
00:01:48,054 --> 00:01:49,817
Mom, dad, family.

16
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:51,687
Finally, I say it.

17
00:01:51,758 --> 00:01:53,555
Marriage has ups and downs.

18
00:01:53,627 --> 00:01:55,458
Being single is rock-n-roll.

19
00:01:55,529 --> 00:01:57,292
Rock-n-roll. Rock-n-roll.

20
00:01:57,364 --> 00:01:58,991
Rock-n-roll. Rock-n-roll.

21
00:01:59,232 --> 00:02:02,463
Your and my nuptial rounds.

22
00:02:17,517 --> 00:02:18,984
Moving round and round.

23
00:02:19,052 --> 00:02:20,917
And my hair is spilling now.

24
00:02:20,987 --> 00:02:22,249
Let me tell you.

25
00:02:22,322 --> 00:02:23,414
What's the cool?

26
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:24,889
To be trusted by the girl.

27
00:02:24,958 --> 00:02:26,550
And my mother forces me.

28
00:02:26,626 --> 00:02:28,560
And my daddy forces me.

29
00:02:28,628 --> 00:02:29,720
Just hold on.

30
00:02:29,796 --> 00:02:32,321
Why can I be only
living in my house?

31
00:02:32,399 --> 00:02:33,889
Let me take in to the club.

32
00:02:33,967 --> 00:02:35,832
Endless party through the night.

33
00:02:35,902 --> 00:02:37,494
Don't want every other.

34
00:02:37,571 --> 00:02:39,596
Who passes time to boring crowd.

35
00:02:39,673 --> 00:02:43,575
Your and my nuptial rounds.

36
00:02:43,643 --> 00:02:45,611
Your and my.

37
00:02:45,679 --> 00:02:47,840
Your and my.

38
00:03:28,021 --> 00:03:28,919
Excuse me!

39
00:03:29,456 --> 00:03:32,789
Can u please move your arm... your
elbow is on my side!

40
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:36,491
No way! Your elbow is on my side!

41
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:37,954
Are you blind??

42
00:03:38,031 --> 00:03:39,464
Are you blind??

43
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:43,063
Speak with respect!!
I'm not your Door-mat wife!

44
00:03:43,803 --> 00:03:46,897
You speak with respect!
I'm not your Hen-pecked husband!

45
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:50,775
What are you doing?

46
00:03:50,844 --> 00:03:52,368
You almost blinded me!!

47
00:03:52,612 --> 00:03:53,772
What are you doing?

48
00:03:53,847 --> 00:03:55,314
Why are you kicking my seat?!!

49
00:03:55,382 --> 00:03:56,644
Don't like your seat kicked?

50
00:03:56,716 --> 00:03:58,650
Should I kick your teeth
in then??! - How rude!

51
00:03:59,286 --> 00:04:01,777
I'm not rude sir, YOU are, I
didn't KICK your seat...

52
00:04:01,855 --> 00:04:02,947
It was an accident!

53
00:04:09,529 --> 00:04:12,327
This is your line!
So keep your hands there!

54
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:15,568
Why did you touch me?!
Talk! Don't touch!

55
00:04:28,949 --> 00:04:31,747
Watch what you're doing!
You've ruined my whole shirt!

56
00:04:34,287 --> 00:04:35,311
Watch it.

57
00:04:35,989 --> 00:04:38,617
Murder! Murder!

58
00:04:40,594 --> 00:04:41,686
What's going on here?

59
00:04:43,396 --> 00:04:45,626
Stop it! - Madam! Madam!

60
00:04:45,699 --> 00:04:46,791
You spilled the food.

61
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:52,604
What the hell??!!!
What are you doing??

62
00:04:52,672 --> 00:04:56,438
I'm sorry! I'm sorry ma'am! Please
stop this fighting!

63
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:58,468
What the hell is happening there?

64
00:04:58,545 --> 00:05:01,810
Sir! Sir! They'll kill each
other!! Please stop them!

65
00:05:05,485 --> 00:05:06,509
Oh my god!

66
00:05:10,457 --> 00:05:13,893
Please calm down!
Calm down all of you! Stop it!

67
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:15,284
Calm down!

68
00:05:16,296 --> 00:05:18,264
Calm down all of you! Stop it!

69
00:05:19,733 --> 00:05:21,792
Captain!!!!

70
00:05:22,035 --> 00:05:23,764
Captain! - Oh my god.

71
00:05:37,817 --> 00:05:39,580
The pilots have fainted!

72
00:06:03,376 --> 00:06:05,435
Ladies and gentlemen.
This is your captain speaking.

73
00:06:05,512 --> 00:06:07,707
We are turning the plane back
to Gaggal airport. - What?

74
00:06:07,781 --> 00:06:09,612
Please take your seats and fasten
your seatbelts at once.

75
00:06:09,683 --> 00:06:12,413
Now look at what you've done!
It's all your fault!!

76
00:06:12,485 --> 00:06:13,509
What did I do?

77
00:06:16,022 --> 00:06:17,387
Hey! That's my bag!

78
00:06:26,266 --> 00:06:27,324
She's gone mad!

79
00:06:27,467 --> 00:06:30,368
What did he just rattle
off in English?

80
00:06:31,404 --> 00:06:34,532
The plane is being turned back
to Gaggal! - Turning back?!

81
00:06:35,408 --> 00:06:38,309
No no!
I have urgent work in Shimla!!

82
00:06:39,946 --> 00:06:42,414
You can't turn back!
Please everyone stop!

83
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:44,907
I have urgent work in Shimla!!

84
00:06:45,518 --> 00:06:46,951
Stop right now!

85
00:06:58,698 --> 00:07:00,791
Please sir... l'm helpless
there is...

86
00:07:00,867 --> 00:07:03,301
...no co pilot available
for 2 days!

87
00:07:07,774 --> 00:07:10,242
I can't help it!

88
00:07:11,778 --> 00:07:12,972
I can't help it!

89
00:07:13,213 --> 00:07:15,238
I need to attend my
brother's wedding!

90
00:07:15,315 --> 00:07:16,509
Sir you are misbehaving!

91
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:21,250
Rajesh! Rajesh! Call-The-Police!

92
00:07:21,321 --> 00:07:22,754
Find out who started
this whole mess!!

93
00:07:22,822 --> 00:07:24,881
Yes!
They won't get away with this!!

94
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:26,823
Find out who started
this whole mess!!

95
00:07:55,522 --> 00:07:57,956
So you thought you could
just sneak away? Alone??

96
00:08:01,628 --> 00:08:03,653
And did you think you could
just sneak off alone?

97
00:08:04,697 --> 00:08:05,755
Excuse me!

98
00:08:06,499 --> 00:08:08,399
Hey! Who the hell are you??!!

99
00:08:08,568 --> 00:08:11,264
I need to reach Shimla
by 4 tomorrow!

100
00:08:11,504 --> 00:08:14,302
So? - So?! So get me there!!!

101
00:08:14,374 --> 00:08:15,432
Are you crazy?!?

102
00:08:15,742 --> 00:08:17,209
Why should we get you there?

103
00:08:17,277 --> 00:08:20,735
Because this flight got cancelled
thanks to you! Get it??

104
00:08:20,814 --> 00:08:22,805
And there are no cabs,
trains or busses here!

105
00:08:22,882 --> 00:08:25,248
Nor do I have 2 more days!!

106
00:08:25,485 --> 00:08:27,350
Now hurry!
If you drive at 80km per hour...

107
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:28,751
...we may make it by 4 tomorrow!

108
00:08:28,988 --> 00:08:30,785
4?!!
What's so special about 4!!!

109
00:08:31,357 --> 00:08:33,587
And how does that concern
you? Huh! - Now hurry...

110
00:08:33,827 --> 00:08:36,022
Or I'll hand you over to that
crowd! They'll skin you alive!

111
00:08:36,262 --> 00:08:36,921
And even if you escape them...

112
00:08:36,996 --> 00:08:37,985
...the cops aren't going
to let you go!

113
00:08:38,231 --> 00:08:39,994
They're already on buddy!!!

114
00:08:40,733 --> 00:08:42,894
It will takes days when
inquiry starts.

115
00:08:43,236 --> 00:08:48,003
If YOU think I'm going to drive
10 hours for you, forget it!

116
00:08:49,342 --> 00:08:51,708
Hard of hearing are you?
Didn't I say I'm in a rush?!!

117
00:09:11,698 --> 00:09:12,858
It's is all your fault!!

118
00:09:13,867 --> 00:09:14,891
Yours!

119
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:43,228
Not even a street sign... do
you know which way to go?

120
00:09:44,631 --> 00:09:46,963
No!
- Can't' figure out in this map...

121
00:09:48,902 --> 00:09:49,960
Let's ask that guy!

122
00:09:53,439 --> 00:09:55,464
What kind of maps they make!
Can't make out anything!

123
00:09:56,342 --> 00:09:58,833
The scooter guy has gone
Mr. Rahul Bhasin!

124
00:09:59,012 --> 00:10:01,378
Why couldn't you have asked him?

125
00:10:01,447 --> 00:10:03,711
Well if it was sooo important...

126
00:10:03,783 --> 00:10:05,717
...why didn't you do ask
him Ms Pooja Bhasin?

127
00:10:05,952 --> 00:10:08,284
He was on your side!
How could I ask him?

128
00:10:08,488 --> 00:10:11,980
Why do men feel it's an insult
to ask for directions?

129
00:10:12,058 --> 00:10:13,821
You guys would rather
bum around for 4 hrs!

130
00:10:13,893 --> 00:10:15,451
Burn up 10 liters of petrol!

131
00:10:15,528 --> 00:10:17,052
Get late for all your
meetings but...

132
00:10:17,297 --> 00:10:18,855
...ask for directions? No way!!

133
00:10:19,465 --> 00:10:20,489
I tell you!!!

134
00:10:20,733 --> 00:10:21,791
I never again...

135
00:10:21,868 --> 00:10:26,305
...Never, want to hear I tell
you I tell you I tell you

136
00:10:26,506 --> 00:10:28,497
I will say what I want!
How I want it!!!

137
00:10:28,574 --> 00:10:30,064
I tell you!

138
00:10:32,045 --> 00:10:33,444
Now I tell you!

139
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,505
Get down! - I'm going to sit
between the two of you!

140
00:10:39,085 --> 00:10:41,417
Rant-rant,
yap-yap, rant-rant, yap-yap

141
00:10:42,522 --> 00:10:44,752
Get back in now!
And no more fighting, you two!!

142
00:10:46,993 --> 00:10:48,790
You've hurt your forehead...

143
00:10:49,429 --> 00:10:51,624
There's band-aid in the back.
- No need.

144
00:10:51,698 --> 00:10:52,756
Just a minute Rahul.

145
00:10:53,433 --> 00:10:56,231
I said come back here!!!
Didn't you hear me? Come back.

146
00:10:56,302 --> 00:10:57,929
Nothing is going to happen
in one minute!

147
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:21,522
Uh... are you a... er... a gangster?

148
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:24,656
How did you manage to get past
security with that gun??

149
00:11:24,731 --> 00:11:27,564
The cop is my pop!
What's it to you??!!

150
00:11:28,067 --> 00:11:31,969
Just watch the speedometer,
you're dipping below 50!

151
00:11:42,482 --> 00:11:43,608
Do you have any money?

152
00:11:44,884 --> 00:11:45,942
Money??

153
00:11:46,586 --> 00:11:48,349
Uh... l'm hungry... but don't
have any money...

154
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:53,524
Hmmm... I guess we can
stop for 15 mins...

155
00:11:53,826 --> 00:11:55,418
15 mins only, get it?!

156
00:11:56,696 --> 00:11:58,926
Uh... could I make a call
from your phone...

157
00:11:59,966 --> 00:12:02,366
...need to inform my family about
the flight being cancelled.

158
00:12:02,735 --> 00:12:04,760
Don't you even have a cell phone,
you looser?

159
00:12:05,738 --> 00:12:07,729
I did!
Ask her what happened to it??!

160
00:12:08,341 --> 00:12:09,433
It's ok!

161
00:12:10,843 --> 00:12:11,901
Take my phone.

162
00:12:15,782 --> 00:12:19,684
And remember...
Don't try to be too smart!

163
00:12:20,019 --> 00:12:21,850
One false move and even
the vultures...

164
00:12:21,921 --> 00:12:23,479
...will not be able to find you!

165
00:12:23,823 --> 00:12:25,450
Hullo... mumma...

166
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,264
Why is your wife sitting
on a separate table?

167
00:12:50,316 --> 00:12:51,783
Myself Jai Dhumal...

168
00:12:58,791 --> 00:13:00,759
You two just got married right?

169
00:13:04,997 --> 00:13:06,021
Love marriage?

170
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:13,430
When did you get married?
- When??! Not 'WHEN'!

171
00:13:13,906 --> 00:13:15,305
Ask me WHY I got married?

172
00:13:15,541 --> 00:13:17,736
Infact, why does anyone
ever get married?

173
00:13:18,611 --> 00:13:20,442
...900 billion rupees sir
are wasted every...

174
00:13:20,513 --> 00:13:22,378
...year in this country! And
worldwide?

175
00:13:22,615 --> 00:13:24,776
Maybe 90 Trillion...

176
00:13:25,384 --> 00:13:29,286
...on this stupid,
outdated institution,

177
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:32,788
What do YOU think? Why... do
people get married??

178
00:13:33,793 --> 00:13:35,954
I don't know about everyone... but
for some I do...

179
00:13:36,028 --> 00:13:37,052
...Free sex!!

180
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:40,297
Even I know about some! Free
punching bag!!

181
00:13:44,303 --> 00:13:46,294
Aren't you both missing
out something??

182
00:13:46,672 --> 00:13:47,696
What??

183
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:50,740
Guess -Kids??

184
00:13:51,911 --> 00:13:53,037
Loneliness?

185
00:13:54,313 --> 00:13:55,473
Why don't you just tell us?

186
00:13:56,816 --> 00:13:57,942
Love!

187
00:13:58,484 --> 00:13:59,508
Love!

188
00:14:12,265 --> 00:14:14,859
Love??!! - Do you know what
my kid brother says?

189
00:14:19,438 --> 00:14:21,929
Not 'Love'!
'Dopamine'... what do you think?

190
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:25,970
When people say Lets make love
they actually mean Love??

191
00:14:26,746 --> 00:14:29,442
No way! The same 'S' word brother!

192
00:14:30,016 --> 00:14:32,314
And you know what's the biggest
tragedy on this planet?

193
00:14:32,385 --> 00:14:36,287
People... always mistake 'Lust'
for 'Love' -What nonsense!

194
00:14:36,722 --> 00:14:38,587
I have 'Felt' true love

195
00:14:38,791 --> 00:14:40,486
Yeah... So did I for a little while

196
00:14:41,394 --> 00:14:43,521
Ok! Tell me... how did the two
of you even end up meeting?

197
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:50,066
Help me settle my pleats, beta

198
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:52,670
Mom, all these years with
a sari and you...

199
00:14:52,738 --> 00:14:54,330
...still can't tie
your own pleats!

200
00:14:54,407 --> 00:14:56,238
Pull them down,
pull them... should I put them in?

201
00:14:57,276 --> 00:14:58,675
Ok... How do I look?

202
00:14:59,512 --> 00:15:00,536
Just a sec...

203
00:15:03,349 --> 00:15:04,373
Now... cute!

204
00:15:04,784 --> 00:15:05,944
You are cute!

205
00:15:06,752 --> 00:15:08,447
Hey!
You know this is my wedding sari!

206
00:15:08,521 --> 00:15:10,011
Rahul... you know... There's
going to be lots...

207
00:15:10,256 --> 00:15:11,917
...of girls at Amit's
wedding tonight.

208
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:15,493
Look, it's been 5 yrs since
you started working...

209
00:15:15,561 --> 00:15:17,927
So why delay getting married if
you're going to do it anyway??

210
00:15:18,598 --> 00:15:20,793
Do you want your kids to
think their parents...

211
00:15:20,866 --> 00:15:22,527
...are a bunch of old
fuddy-duddies?

212
00:15:23,769 --> 00:15:24,997
Look... you're 27 now...

213
00:15:25,238 --> 00:15:28,230
...by the time you get married
and have kids you'll...

214
00:15:28,307 --> 00:15:30,798
...be about 29 and by the
time your child is...

215
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:32,500
18 you'll be 47 so far so good!

216
00:15:32,778 --> 00:15:34,678
A bigger age difference
and you two...

217
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,814
...will never understand
each other!

218
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:40,285
Mom! How many times have I told
you to not clean my room!

219
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:41,882
I can't find anything again!

220
00:15:41,954 --> 00:15:42,978
See?

221
00:15:43,456 --> 00:15:45,447
You get ready fast... we need
to leave in 10 minutes.

222
00:15:45,825 --> 00:15:48,794
Oh Raju!
My god! All grown up huh?!!!

223
00:15:48,894 --> 00:15:50,418
I'm going to love it... yeeck

224
00:15:50,496 --> 00:15:52,361
I should've had you
when I was 27!!

225
00:15:52,531 --> 00:15:53,555
Whatever!

226
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:57,962
Whateeeev... yo... ee! Where
did he go now?

227
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,764
And remember... eat up
the cheese and...

228
00:16:02,842 --> 00:16:03,740
...cassata before it finishes!!

229
00:16:03,809 --> 00:16:05,674
Forget the cheese... find
him a girl first...

230
00:16:08,314 --> 00:16:09,440
Please, please come in!

231
00:16:09,615 --> 00:16:11,480
Yes it's a new necklace,
cost 2 million rupees!

232
00:16:11,651 --> 00:16:14,017
Rahul!!! When do we get some
'Good' news from you huh??

233
00:16:14,253 --> 00:16:15,686
You're 27 now, aren't you?

234
00:16:16,622 --> 00:16:19,785
Raju??
My god! All grown up huh?!!!

235
00:16:20,326 --> 00:16:22,556
Raju! ...didn't I tell you not
to be all grow up huh?

236
00:16:22,695 --> 00:16:25,357
Kids these days aunty!
They just don't listen to anyone.

237
00:16:25,665 --> 00:16:27,428
Sense of humor... Huh!

238
00:16:29,235 --> 00:16:31,396
Anyway,
head in have a peg and a bite,

239
00:16:31,771 --> 00:16:33,898
The cheese has been flown in
especially from Amritsar

240
00:16:34,273 --> 00:16:35,467
Mrs. Sharma!!!

241
00:16:37,977 --> 00:16:40,241
Hmm a little too chubby

242
00:16:41,547 --> 00:16:43,378
Ooh... Rahul... Look! She pretty!
Isn't she?

243
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:46,712
Come let's go!

244
00:16:46,786 --> 00:16:48,378
Heyyy!! What're you doing?? Stop!

245
00:16:48,888 --> 00:16:51,356
The girl should be smart! Lf
both of...

246
00:16:51,424 --> 00:16:53,654
...them are silly how
will they manage??

247
00:16:53,726 --> 00:16:54,750
Exactly!

248
00:16:54,827 --> 00:16:56,351
What do you mean by 'Silly'??

249
00:16:56,595 --> 00:16:59,723
A girl should be like... ahhh!
Like her... SMAART!

250
00:17:02,902 --> 00:17:04,494
. Come here both of you!

251
00:17:05,438 --> 00:17:06,462
Once and for all!

252
00:17:06,572 --> 00:17:09,541
When I want to get married
I will find my own girl!

253
00:17:09,875 --> 00:17:11,206
This is so embarrassing!

254
00:17:12,978 --> 00:17:14,946
Now take this and just chill! Ok?

255
00:17:15,014 --> 00:17:16,208
You chill!

256
00:17:26,392 --> 00:17:27,416
Let's go to Amit.

257
00:17:39,472 --> 00:17:41,372
Well, hurry up and finish
lunch all of you!

258
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,771
It's almost time!!

259
00:17:58,858 --> 00:18:01,326
Uff! Mom?
- Try this on! - I need to decide...

260
00:18:01,394 --> 00:18:02,361
Whether I should get
you a suit or a...

261
00:18:02,428 --> 00:18:03,486
...sherwani when you
get married!!??

262
00:18:03,562 --> 00:18:05,223
Are you crazy?? - Where's Amit?

263
00:18:05,698 --> 00:18:06,790
He's in the bathroom!

264
00:18:07,967 --> 00:18:08,991
Now try this on!!

265
00:18:09,335 --> 00:18:10,427
I won't!

266
00:18:10,936 --> 00:18:12,267
This is so childish!

267
00:18:14,907 --> 00:18:16,772
No one cares about my feelings...

268
00:18:19,211 --> 00:18:22,442
...l'm just a piece of furniture...
- Ok... ok... give it here...

269
00:18:24,283 --> 00:18:25,375
It's not even my size!

270
00:18:28,587 --> 00:18:30,885
Well you see... excuse me...

271
00:18:30,956 --> 00:18:32,981
Hello! We're in Amit's room!

272
00:18:33,626 --> 00:18:35,457
Hurry up and get us some
cheese shashlik...

273
00:18:35,528 --> 00:18:38,895
...and cassata ice-cream!

274
00:18:42,501 --> 00:18:43,525
Excuse me.

275
00:18:45,438 --> 00:18:47,030
Oh so cute! 'Brocade... '!!!

276
00:18:47,273 --> 00:18:50,265
Happy? Enough now!
- Get me out of this!

277
00:18:50,476 --> 00:18:51,704
What are you doing?

278
00:18:52,278 --> 00:18:53,677
The beads are stuck in the button

279
00:18:56,582 --> 00:18:57,606
Amit

280
00:19:02,521 --> 00:19:05,183
Amit beta! Lts Seema aunty!

281
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:08,950
It seems your bathroom
door is... uh... jammed...

282
00:19:09,295 --> 00:19:10,523
I'll get the locksmith ok?

283
00:19:10,963 --> 00:19:13,557
Hurry! What are you doing?
Get it off!! - I am trying.

284
00:19:13,732 --> 00:19:15,529
Get it off get off!
What if someone comes?

285
00:19:15,701 --> 00:19:17,532
One tug and it'll
come undone and...

286
00:19:17,603 --> 00:19:19,628
...this sherwani too... will... Tear...

287
00:19:22,575 --> 00:19:23,735
You tore it!! - I? ...l...

288
00:19:23,943 --> 00:19:26,776
Pooja! Will you check on Amit??

289
00:19:27,513 --> 00:19:29,378
Yes Aunty!

290
00:19:29,448 --> 00:19:30,472
Amit

291
00:19:33,619 --> 00:19:35,348
Ready, Amit?

292
00:19:36,388 --> 00:19:39,448
Hi!!! Oh you're dressed??

293
00:19:39,859 --> 00:19:41,827
This colour is looking
so good on you!

294
00:19:42,862 --> 00:19:45,456
Oh I saw such a cute guy outside!

295
00:19:45,831 --> 00:19:47,924
But his parents were so funny!

296
00:19:48,634 --> 00:19:50,363
Look at this girl... look
at that girl!

297
00:19:52,304 --> 00:19:53,430
Hey tell me something?

298
00:19:54,373 --> 00:19:57,308
Why do people pounce on the cheese
and cassata at weddings?

299
00:19:57,376 --> 00:19:58,866
As if they've never
eaten it before?

300
00:19:59,044 --> 00:20:00,739
My grandfather used to say:

301
00:20:00,946 --> 00:20:02,675
Maybe the food is someone
else's but...

302
00:20:02,748 --> 00:20:04,306
...the stomach is your own right?

303
00:20:05,651 --> 00:20:08,381
Hey! What's wrong with you
? are you nervous...

304
00:20:15,361 --> 00:20:16,953
Mother, what are you doing?

305
00:20:17,029 --> 00:20:19,361
She can't go out now!
She's seen everything!

306
00:20:20,065 --> 00:20:22,431
She can't go out now!
She's seen everything!

307
00:20:23,469 --> 00:20:26,563
Uh... sorry... my mom's... is
my mom you know...

308
00:20:27,339 --> 00:20:28,533
Aunty... l'm so sorry!

309
00:20:28,607 --> 00:20:29,596
I didn't mean any of the
things I just said...

310
00:20:29,675 --> 00:20:31,768
It's ok! We'll settle that later!

311
00:20:32,044 --> 00:20:33,807
Right now we have a bigger crisis!

312
00:20:33,879 --> 00:20:35,642
He's stuck in this sherwani
and there's...

313
00:20:35,714 --> 00:20:37,045
...only 5 mins to the ceremony!

314
00:20:37,383 --> 00:20:39,351
God knows which stupid designer
has made this...

315
00:20:39,418 --> 00:20:43,081
Such weak stitches!!
- Oh god! Aunty!

316
00:20:43,355 --> 00:20:45,084
You don't worry,
- In the next room...

317
00:20:45,357 --> 00:20:47,518
...in the left drawer,
there is a needle and some thread,

318
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:50,291
Please bring that while
I try and fix this...

319
00:20:50,429 --> 00:20:51,453
Ok.

320
00:21:15,921 --> 00:21:17,821
Here are the rasgullas
and cheese!!! Uhh??

321
00:21:19,959 --> 00:21:21,551
So many plates??!

322
00:21:23,495 --> 00:21:25,963
...uh... actually my dad
has diabetes...

323
00:21:26,031 --> 00:21:27,498
And he's not allowed sweets...

324
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,067
Even then he manages to eat the...

325
00:21:29,301 --> 00:21:31,064
...whole year's quota in one go!
- On the sly!

326
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:33,997
Who Me? - No! Me!

327
00:21:35,374 --> 00:21:38,741
Dad... dad... come on... put it
down... put the plates down.

328
00:21:40,512 --> 00:21:41,911
And only one rasgullas for you!

329
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:45,008
Have you ever noticed

330
00:21:46,518 --> 00:21:50,010
How, with age... parents turn into
kids and kids into parents?

331
00:21:50,456 --> 00:21:52,048
When we were small they
would tell us...

332
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:53,758
...'Don't do this... don't
do that...

333
00:21:53,859 --> 00:21:56,020
Now we have to keep telling
them 'Only one rasgullas...

334
00:21:56,261 --> 00:21:58,695
...for you you'll get diabetes.
- Uh... I mean you've got diabetes!

335
00:21:58,964 --> 00:22:00,022
Are you crazy??

336
00:22:00,699 --> 00:22:02,428
And what are you doing
in that sherwani??

337
00:22:02,735 --> 00:22:04,396
What are you doing
in that sherwani??

338
00:22:06,005 --> 00:22:07,438
Amit... where's Amit?

339
00:22:07,506 --> 00:22:08,973
We've brought all this
food for him?

340
00:22:12,311 --> 00:22:13,505
Where's Amit? - Move!

341
00:22:13,579 --> 00:22:15,410
Found the needle!!

342
00:22:17,783 --> 00:22:18,909
Oh nothing Aunty!

343
00:22:19,051 --> 00:22:21,645
There were some last minute
adjustments to be made in the...

344
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:24,553
...sherwani so I requested him to
try it on for me for a bit...

345
00:22:24,623 --> 00:22:27,353
Oh ok... just get him down
quickly, its almost time...

346
00:22:33,632 --> 00:22:36,692
I am the stupid designer
of sherwani?

347
00:22:50,616 --> 00:22:52,083
So, you're a fashion designer?

348
00:22:52,751 --> 00:22:54,776
Ya but you don't look like one!

349
00:22:54,953 --> 00:22:57,786
What do you mean? What?

350
00:23:01,493 --> 00:23:02,517
The shoes??

351
00:23:17,743 --> 00:23:20,007
Are you crazy?
You're going to dance barefoot?

352
00:23:25,451 --> 00:23:29,512
Her moves are scintillating.

353
00:23:29,588 --> 00:23:31,556
Is the gal haughty?

354
00:23:31,623 --> 00:23:33,750
Or is she hot?

355
00:23:33,826 --> 00:23:37,694

379
00:25:20,432 --> 00:25:21,592
Pooja...

380
00:25:26,338 --> 00:25:27,362

Lust at first sight man. Why is
everyone always mistaking it!

00:25:45,858 --> 00:25:47,723
But mum?!

386
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:50,392
You know specially after
Kalpana chawla died?

387
00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:52,888

00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,769
But no! Mom wanted me to
manage her boutique...

390
00:25:58,003 --> 00:25:59,800
I'm her only child u see?

391
00:25:59,872 --> 00:26:01,430
I didn't want to make her unhappy!

392
00:26:03,408 --> 00:26:05,968
When I go to America? L'm
surely going...

393
00:26:06,245 --> 00:26:08,406
...to try that anti-gravity walk!!

394
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,278
They say there's a room
at NASA where you can!!

Just imagine!!
You're on the moon!!

What?
- I can't promise you the moon.

398
00:26:22,761 --> 00:26:25,958
But I CAN promise you a
'Moonwalk' for sure!

399
00:26:28,901 --> 00:26:31,870
Is this how one proposes
to a girl??

400
00:26:32,771 --> 00:26:34,762
Right! What am I doing?!

401
00:26:38,043 --> 00:26:39,237

Why don't you just shoot your
self in the head right now...

411
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:44,374
No sense in a slow
death... day-by-day, bit-by-bit!!!

412
00:27:47,779 --> 00:27:49,041
Come here you cynic!

413

Come on.

414
00:28:16,608 --> 00:28:18,473
She's put a spell on you!

415
00:28:22,481 --> 00:28:24,278
He's put a spell on you!

416
00:28:24,916 --> 00:28:26,349
What's the big rush?

417
00:28:26,618 --> 00:28:28,017

such an innocent...

420
00:28:32,491 --> 00:28:34,425
...and... and... infectious
laughter??

421
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:37,991
Dad, have you ever met someone and
within minutes felt like.

422
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:40,289
That you have a past life connect?

423
00:28:41,299 --> 00:28:42,323
How did you know?

424
00:28:43,335 --> 00:28:47,567
Believe it or not...
I was 23 year old too... once!

425
00:28:49,341 --> 00:28:50,638
But what you see is...

426
00:28:50,709 --> 00:28:52,540
Is what will be dad!
In our case Dad!!

427
00:28:52,644 --> 00:28:55,943
Besides We've even done a
compatibility test! - What's that?

428
00:28:56,181 --> 00:28:57,580
Compatibility test dad!!

429
00:28:57,783 --> 00:28:58,841
What have you done?

430
00:28:59,751 --> 00:29:00,945
A compatibility test??

431
00:29:03,688 --> 00:29:05,383
I can smell our happiness.

432
00:29:05,991 --> 00:29:07,185
Me too!!

433
00:29:09,995 --> 00:29:13,795
Ok let's see if the two of us are
made for each other or not!

434
00:29:13,965 --> 00:29:14,989
But...

435
00:29:15,901 --> 00:29:16,925
What is this?

436
00:29:17,369 --> 00:29:19,269
Hmmm, you have to answer
in a 'Yes' or a 'No'...

437
00:29:19,404 --> 00:29:21,497
...do you both believe
that your partner...

438
00:29:21,573 --> 00:29:23,404
...should be your best friend?

439
00:29:23,708 --> 00:29:24,732
Yes!!!

440
00:29:25,477 --> 00:29:27,468
Do you both accept that
however similar...

441
00:29:27,546 --> 00:29:29,013
...two people are different.

442
00:29:29,548 --> 00:29:31,573
Yes! - Being the same would be soo

443
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:32,674
Boring!

444
00:29:35,687 --> 00:29:38,315
Can you read each other's minds

445
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:40,280
Hey! Didn't we just do that??

446
00:29:42,828 --> 00:29:44,989
Do you both agree that a
fight between partners...

447
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:46,788
...should never involve outsiders?

448
00:29:46,865 --> 00:29:48,560
Like mother-in-law,
father-in-law etc?

449
00:29:48,633 --> 00:29:50,430
May our enemies fight!!

450
00:29:53,004 --> 00:29:58,533
Do you agree that both man or
woman can initiate lovemaking?

451
00:29:58,610 --> 00:30:00,475
Of course! Which era is
this quiz master from??

452
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:04,380
Do you both like the
same kind of food?

453
00:30:04,449 --> 00:30:05,473
Chinese?!

454
00:30:06,551 --> 00:30:07,677
I don't believe this!

455
00:30:07,752 --> 00:30:09,720
Me too! Chinese

456
00:30:10,755 --> 00:30:13,053
What is your favorite color?

457
00:30:13,325 --> 00:30:15,020
Red? - Pink? - Same thing!

458
00:30:15,427 --> 00:30:19,056
Do you both agree on where you
want to go for your honeymoon?

459
00:30:19,331 --> 00:30:20,355
Himachal!?

460
00:30:21,333 --> 00:30:22,357
Oh my god.

461
00:30:22,801 --> 00:30:23,927
Ok last question!

462
00:30:24,369 --> 00:30:28,567
Are your names Romeo-Juliet,
laila-majnu... or Rahul-Pooja??

463
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:30,674
It's a sign. Right?

464
00:30:30,742 --> 00:30:31,936
Of course dude!

465
00:30:33,812 --> 00:30:35,336

00:30:35,413 --> 00:30:37,005
...then you are I want to
know you better couple...

467

00:30:38,650 --> 00:30:40,083
...a 2 bodies one soul couple!

469
00:30:40,418 --> 00:30:41,442
Wait.

470
00:30:45,724 --> 00:30:47,988
2 bodies one soul! Partner!

471
00:30:57,302 --> 00:30:58,462
May be you were right!

472
00:30:58,703 --> 00:31:00,466
Maybe all this Get married

473
00:31:00,539 --> 00:31:01,767
...talk really did brainwash me!!

474
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:04,331
Nonsense... I really
feel I love her!

475
00:31:04,409 --> 00:31:06,240
It was love at first sight!
You were there weren't you?!

476
00:31:06,311 --> 00:31:07,369
When she smiles...

477
00:31:08,513 --> 00:31:10,378
You're a big cynic for your age!!

478
00:31:10,949 --> 00:31:13,918
Cancel it bro! You still
have 2 hrs to go!

479
00:31:14,686 --> 00:31:16,551
Who knows... if she will...
Stinks here!

480
00:31:17,289 --> 00:31:18,779
She smells like roses!

481
00:31:18,857 --> 00:31:21,792
Now maybe! Who knows if she
even bathes every day??

482
00:31:22,327 --> 00:31:24,056
Women are masters of deception!

483
00:31:24,296 --> 00:31:25,388
The truth will only
come out when the...

484
00:31:25,463 --> 00:31:27,522
...two of you start living
together! - How would you know??

485
00:31:27,599 --> 00:31:29,430
Have you ever had cyanide?
- You want me to die?

486
00:31:29,501 --> 00:31:31,401
You know without having
cyanide... that it kills!

487
00:31:31,469 --> 00:31:32,458
Similarly I know without getting...

488
00:31:32,537 --> 00:31:33,731
...married... that it'll kills! QED

489
00:31:33,805 --> 00:31:38,640
Rahul! The photos of the
motor home have arrived!

490
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:41,304
Who goes for a honeymoon
in a motor home?

491
00:31:41,379 --> 00:31:42,869
A hotel would be far
more practical!

492
00:31:43,682 --> 00:31:45,513
You never had a romantic
bone in your body!

493
00:31:45,584 --> 00:31:47,518
Always practical practical! At

495
00:31:49,354 --> 00:31:51,584
Go son! I'm soo proud of you...

496
00:31:52,324 --> 00:31:55,885
...did you know that my brother
has gifted this to you guys?

497
00:31:56,361 --> 00:31:58,454
As soon as your plane
lands at Kulu...

498
00:31:58,530 --> 00:32:01,021
...you'll find it parked
in the parking lot.

499
00:32:01,266 --> 00:32:03,461
I how excited I am!!

500
00:32:03,535 --> 00:32:04,968
What are YOU excited about??

501
00:32:05,637 --> 00:32:08,936
Uff... I should have had
you when I was 27!!

502
00:32:09,474 --> 00:32:10,498
Whatever!

503
00:32:10,942 --> 00:32:12,671
Himachal, here I come!!

504
00:32:14,446 --> 00:32:15,572
Here you go!

505
00:32:17,048 --> 00:32:18,572
Homemade radish parathas!

506
00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:19,674
I made them myself!

507
00:32:19,751 --> 00:32:21,309
You want him to eat radish
parathas on his honeymoon!!

508
00:32:21,386 --> 00:32:24,321
Don't worry, I'll take care...

509
00:32:24,389 --> 00:32:25,413
Ok mamma...

510
00:32:25,624 --> 00:32:30,027
Oh my son... my dear dear son!!

511
00:32:30,295 --> 00:32:31,660
Go... - You will miss the flight.

512
00:32:32,464 --> 00:32:33,590
Bye, mom.

513
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:39,394
Bye.

514
00:32:41,906 --> 00:32:43,339
Enough Seema

515
00:32:43,408 --> 00:32:44,739
My son is gone!

516
00:32:45,744 --> 00:32:47,336
I give them 1 yr max.

517
00:32:47,412 --> 00:32:48,640
Just shut up! You jinx!

518
00:32:49,447 --> 00:32:51,005
I can see the future... wanna bet?

519
00:32:51,349 --> 00:32:53,783
You may lose the bet this time
son! The girl seems sensible!

520
00:32:53,985 --> 00:32:55,976
Oh and Rahul isn't?
- He's an idiot!

521
00:32:56,421 --> 00:32:58,514
How can you say that
about your own son??

522
00:32:58,590 --> 00:33:00,558
Maybe you haven't seen that
I have eyes!! Your...

523
00:33:00,625 --> 00:33:02,957
...son is a lazy spoilt brat!
- He wouldn't just be My son...

524
00:33:03,028 --> 00:33:04,290
...if you had paid a little
more attention to him...

525
00:33:04,362 --> 00:33:05,852
...instead of counting your
money all the time!!

526
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:08,421
Your diamonds and...

527
00:33:08,633 --> 00:33:10,658
Stop! Stop!!

528
00:33:11,536 --> 00:33:12,867
What's the bet dudes?

529
00:33:13,605 --> 00:33:14,697
L-Pad.

530
00:33:15,507 --> 00:33:16,531
Come on now!

531
00:33:28,286 --> 00:33:29,310
Happy?

532
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:24,900
I was thinking... why don't
we start with...

533
00:34:25,543 --> 00:34:26,601
A bath?

534
00:34:34,352 --> 00:34:35,842
Pooja! The water will be cold!

535
00:34:54,939 --> 00:34:57,931
Pooja... umm... I'm afraid of
water... I can't swim...

536
00:35:33,311 --> 00:35:35,939
What's up mamma?
- How's it going son?

537
00:35:36,281 --> 00:35:37,771
Couldn't be better ma.

538
00:35:41,386 --> 00:35:44,651
If there's any problem, any
problem at all... just call me ok?

539
00:35:45,356 --> 00:35:46,482
What problem ma?

540
00:35:46,624 --> 00:35:48,421
Son, god forbid you ever
have any problem!

541
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,819
But this is all new for you...

542
00:35:51,262 --> 00:35:53,321
So if there are any confusions
or anything... just...

543
00:35:53,398 --> 00:35:56,629
...ask me on the phone ok?
- Don't worry mom... all cool... ciao!

544
00:35:56,701 --> 00:35:58,328
Ok... cha... ciao ciao ciao...

545
00:36:02,941 --> 00:36:04,602
What problem? - Nothing.

546
00:36:05,276 --> 00:36:09,440
. mom! Her biggest problem is
when she has no problem!

547
00:36:10,315 --> 00:36:12,374
Completely over active
imagination you know.

548
00:36:14,018 --> 00:36:16,316
Did she by any chance mean me?

549
00:36:16,988 --> 00:36:18,319
You know... problem... me?

550
00:36:24,429 --> 00:36:25,726
But no worries...

551
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:27,964
I had decided as a child
that I would...

552
00:36:28,366 --> 00:36:30,766
...never fight with
my mother in law.

553
00:36:31,302 --> 00:36:33,668
Just imagine how difficult
it must be for a woman...

554
00:36:33,738 --> 00:36:34,727
One fine day...

555
00:36:34,806 --> 00:36:37,274
Some strange woman arrives
and whisks her son away!

556
00:36:37,342 --> 00:36:39,469
We will never have any mother
in law-daughter-in-law...

557
00:36:39,544 --> 00:36:41,478
...kind of problems in our lives!
- Forget it.

558
00:36:43,848 --> 00:36:47,807
Hey...
You want to sleep in or out. - You?

559
00:36:48,286 --> 00:36:51,949
Wherever, however you are my
love... that's where I want to be.

560
00:37:35,333 --> 00:37:37,665
You go...
- No no... you first... please...

561
00:37:38,770 --> 00:37:39,794
Are you sure?

562
00:37:40,004 --> 00:37:41,301
Yeah. Totally.

563
00:37:51,049 --> 00:37:52,243
Oh god...

564
00:37:54,986 --> 00:37:57,648
...jal tu jaaltu... ayi

565
00:37:57,889 --> 00:38:00,517
...jal tu jaaltu... ayi

566
00:38:40,965 --> 00:38:41,989

567
00:38:49,574 --> 00:38:52,668
. so shall I go have a bath too?
- Yeah! - Bye

568
00:38:53,011 --> 00:38:54,035
Bye!

569
00:39:06,891 --> 00:39:13,854
My desires are
dashing beyond the sky.

570
00:39:13,931 --> 00:39:20,336
My desires are
dashing beyond the sky.

571
00:39:20,405 --> 00:39:27,243
Love is blossoming and blooming.

572
00:39:27,311 --> 00:39:30,303
Your and my nuptial rounds.

573
00:39:30,381 --> 00:39:33,544
Your and my nuptial rounds.

574
00:39:33,618 --> 00:39:38,214
Your and my nuptial rounds.

575
00:39:38,289 --> 00:39:41,349
The moon across the lake.

576
00:39:41,426 --> 00:39:44,327
Made me vibrant.

577
00:39:44,395 --> 00:39:48,229
The moon that you gave me.

578
00:39:48,299 --> 00:39:50,961
Made me vibrant.

579
00:39:51,602 --> 00:39:56,938
Your and my nuptial rounds.

580
00:40:24,335 --> 00:40:29,568
Your and my nuptial rounds.

581
00:40:30,541 --> 00:40:36,537
Your and my nuptial rounds.

582
00:40:46,090 --> 00:40:47,284
Yes! Hullo

583
00:40:47,525 --> 00:40:49,049
Will reach tomorrow
before 4 for sure.

584
00:40:51,462 --> 00:40:52,952
Don't worry... trust me... l'm... l...

585
00:40:54,031 --> 00:40:55,931
Stop the van!
- Lf you want to reach by 4 then...

586
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,558
Hey I told you to stop didn't I?

587
00:41:04,876 --> 00:41:08,972
I... love you Muskaan...

588
00:41:11,849 --> 00:41:13,043
I'll be there soon...

589
00:41:14,685 --> 00:41:18,951
And then we will be
together forever.

590
00:41:20,525 --> 00:41:22,288
Bye...

591
00:41:23,594 --> 00:41:25,027
How the hell are you driving??

592
00:41:25,496 --> 00:41:27,430
Why did you break so suddenly?
- I!

593
00:41:27,498 --> 00:41:29,864
If you don't know how to
drive let me drive!!

594
00:41:29,934 --> 00:41:30,958
Be my guest!

595
00:41:40,945 --> 00:41:42,970
This local Romeo-Juliet pair
is going drive me nuts!

596
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:50,014
Oops! Sorry... I had keys!

597
00:41:57,461 --> 00:41:59,429
You're pretty short tempered...

598
00:42:04,468 --> 00:42:06,663
Actually... it was my fault... this
sudden brake...

599
00:42:06,804 --> 00:42:08,567
Well I... had to say something
to Muskaan...

600
00:42:08,639 --> 00:42:09,901
You've nicked your forehead...

601
00:42:13,678 --> 00:42:16,442
If you are angry with your
husband, why take it out on me?

602
00:42:16,747 --> 00:42:18,647
What happened after all... between
the two of you?

603
00:43:32,556 --> 00:43:36,720
Beat the drums.

604
00:43:39,630 --> 00:43:43,589
Beat the drums.

605
00:43:43,668 --> 00:43:44,760
Have the drink.

606
00:43:44,835 --> 00:43:46,359
And shake Kashi.

607
00:43:47,305 --> 00:43:48,829
Hail God.

608
00:43:48,906 --> 00:43:50,965
The red wine is intoxicating.

609
00:43:51,042 --> 00:43:52,634
Hail God.

610
00:43:52,710 --> 00:43:54,678
What will you gain by being sober?

611
00:43:54,745 --> 00:43:56,212
Hail God.

612
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:58,510
The intoxication is fragrant.

613
00:44:11,329 --> 00:44:14,958
Well done. Well done.

614
00:44:15,032 --> 00:44:18,934
Well done. Well done.

615
00:44:26,544 --> 00:44:28,705
Floating on a smoldering lake.

616
00:44:28,779 --> 00:44:30,440
Is the boat of breaths.

617
00:44:30,514 --> 00:44:32,345
Drink it as a devotee
of Lord Shiva.

618
00:44:32,416 --> 00:44:33,610
Merrily.

619
00:44:33,684 --> 00:44:35,379
Drink this intoxicant.

620
00:44:35,453 --> 00:44:37,512
And enjoy.

621
00:44:37,588 --> 00:44:39,419
Hail God.

622
00:44:39,490 --> 00:44:41,458
The red wine is intoxicating.

623
00:44:41,525 --> 00:44:42,992
Hail God.

624
00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:45,255
What will you gain by being sober?

625
00:44:45,329 --> 00:44:46,660
Hail God.

626
00:44:46,731 --> 00:44:49,063
The intoxication is fragrant.

627
00:44:59,610 --> 00:45:01,339
Hail God.

628
00:45:01,412 --> 00:45:03,403
The red wine is intoxicating.

629
00:45:03,481 --> 00:45:05,244
Hail God.

630
00:45:05,316 --> 00:45:07,011
What will you gain by being sober?

631
00:45:07,251 --> 00:45:08,650
Hail God.

632
00:45:08,719 --> 00:45:11,449
The intoxication is fragrant.

633
00:45:38,916 --> 00:45:40,315
Hullo madam!

634
00:45:42,553 --> 00:45:43,577
Hi...

635
00:45:44,422 --> 00:45:46,049
Had a good time? - Yeah!

636
00:46:04,008 --> 00:46:05,202
Are you angry?

637
00:46:06,710 --> 00:46:07,734
No...

638
00:46:11,449 --> 00:46:13,542
Alright... I did get
a little scared...

639
00:46:13,818 --> 00:46:15,445
Anything could have happened...

640
00:46:17,288 --> 00:46:20,689
What? - Well you know anything
could have happened...

641
00:46:20,758 --> 00:46:22,658
...all those drunk
weirdoes' around.

642
00:46:24,695 --> 00:46:27,823
Could have happened... but
didn't happen...

643
00:46:28,232 --> 00:46:31,326
Come on... why are you angry?

644
00:46:31,402 --> 00:46:32,630
I'm not angry...

645
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:34,864
Yes you are... I can see
it! You are angry!

646
00:46:34,939 --> 00:46:35,963
No I'm not angry!

647
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:37,974
You are!

648
00:46:38,042 --> 00:46:40,510
No I'm not angry Rahul! - You are!

649
00:46:40,578 --> 00:46:41,602
No

650
00:47:12,676 --> 00:47:14,940
I'm sorry... about yesterday...

651
00:47:18,516 --> 00:47:19,983
Darn... what a hangover

652
00:47:27,925 --> 00:47:28,949
Look Rahul,

653
00:47:29,627 --> 00:47:31,322
I don't want this marriage to be...

654
00:47:31,395 --> 00:47:33,386
...like a noose around your neck.

655
00:47:34,798 --> 00:47:36,925
One must do what one
wants to do...

656
00:47:41,639 --> 00:47:43,368
Only it makes me sad
that you prefer to...

657
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:45,032
...drink than spend time with me...

658
00:47:46,410 --> 00:47:47,434
That's not true...

659
00:47:47,745 --> 00:47:50,646
O... come on?? Otherwise is 2
o'clock any time to drink??

660
00:47:51,015 --> 00:47:55,042
That too in the afternoon?? I
mean you were away for 7 hrs!

661
00:47:55,252 --> 00:47:56,276
2 to 9!

662
00:47:56,487 --> 00:47:58,250
On the 3rd day of our
honeymoon Rahul!

663
00:47:58,322 --> 00:47:59,516
We're on a holiday!!

664
00:47:59,590 --> 00:48:00,887
On a honeymoon?

665
00:48:00,958 --> 00:48:02,858
You mean one can't have
fun on a honeymoon?

666
00:48:02,927 --> 00:48:05,259
Is drinking the only
way to have fun??

667
00:48:05,329 --> 00:48:06,728
And that too at 2 o'clock?

668
00:48:06,797 --> 00:48:08,697
2 o'clock! 2 o'clock!

669
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:10,790
Is there a fixed time
for drinking!!??

670
00:48:10,935 --> 00:48:13,460
Then please let me know
when that is...

671
00:48:13,804 --> 00:48:15,601
In fact while you're at it...

672
00:48:15,673 --> 00:48:17,197
Why don't you just give me
a list of what I can and...

673
00:48:17,274 --> 00:48:19,333
...what I can't do so you don't
loose your temper!

674
00:48:23,414 --> 00:48:25,245
Rahul... we're... fighting...

675
00:48:25,482 --> 00:48:26,972
We are not fighting,
YOU are fighting!

676
00:48:27,785 --> 00:48:30,276
One shouldn't have so many
Rules in life Pooja!!

677
00:48:34,258 --> 00:48:36,988
So You don't like rules do you??

678
00:48:37,928 --> 00:48:39,020
Fine! Stop the van!!

679
00:48:42,032 --> 00:48:43,226
Stop it right now!!

680
00:49:06,690 --> 00:49:07,714
Mother!

681
00:49:25,009 --> 00:49:26,203
Hullo.

682
00:49:26,710 --> 00:49:29,543
What happened?? - Nothing happened
ma! What should've happened?

683
00:49:29,613 --> 00:49:32,343
I can tell from your voice that
both of you are fighting.

684
00:49:32,783 --> 00:49:33,807
Are you fighting??

685
00:49:34,585 --> 00:49:35,882
I don't understand her mom!

686
00:49:36,587 --> 00:49:38,282
She wiped off a whole
bottle of Vodka!

687
00:49:38,355 --> 00:49:39,822
And she's fighting over
something that...

688
00:49:39,890 --> 00:49:42,017
...never happened in the first
place!! - Exactly, son!

689
00:49:42,593 --> 00:49:43,617
Seema.

690
00:49:48,032 --> 00:49:50,762
Look son, it is only woman
who are capable of...

691
00:49:51,302 --> 00:49:53,862
...fighting over things
that never happened...

692
00:49:54,705 --> 00:49:57,299
We can be a bit unreasonable
at times...

693
00:49:57,975 --> 00:50:02,639
But just forget everything
and make up with her ok?

694
00:50:03,414 --> 00:50:05,279
Ok?

695
00:50:05,849 --> 00:50:06,873
Come home soon...

696
00:50:08,419 --> 00:50:09,443
See you soon ok?

697
00:50:10,254 --> 00:50:11,278
What happened?

698
00:50:16,694 --> 00:50:17,718
Who died?

699
00:50:20,531 --> 00:50:21,998
Pooja and Rahul had a fight...

700
00:50:22,599 --> 00:50:25,500
I told you,
I told you, I told you!!

701
00:50:25,569 --> 00:50:26,763
I knew it. Yes!

702

I told you,

703

I'M going to win the bet!!!
I'd like my I pad in Silver!

704
00:50:39,083 --> 00:50:40,778
Hey did you guys notice
something??

705
00:50:41,018 --> 00:50:44,283
What? - It's only day 3!! - You
know... there is cancer... and then...

706
00:50:44,355 --> 00:50:45,413
...there is galloping cancer...

707
00:50:45,489 --> 00:50:47,047
Looks like this is the
galloping variety!

708
00:50:48,325 --> 00:50:49,986
I don't think I'm going
to have to...

709
00:50:50,060 --> 00:50:51,721
...wait even a year for my bike!!

710
00:50:52,529 --> 00:50:54,997
You've given birth to TWO idiots!

711
00:50:55,299 --> 00:50:57,665
Of coarse!
I'm a bigger wonder than Dolly...

712
00:50:57,968 --> 00:51:00,664
...I gave birth to both of all
by myself! - Who is Dolly now?

713
00:51:01,772 --> 00:51:04,036
Lord knows what news
you watch! Dolly!

714
00:51:04,441 --> 00:51:07,308
The sheep that gave birth to
another sheep all by herself.

715
00:51:07,378 --> 00:51:10,040
Dolly part2! - What is this
'All by yourself' All...

716
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:11,713
...by yourself you keep on about?

717
00:51:11,982 --> 00:51:13,643
If I had sat at home
changing nappies...

718
00:51:13,717 --> 00:51:16,550
...who do you think would have gone
and earned money Madam??!

719
00:51:46,517 --> 00:51:47,541
...headache?

720
00:51:50,554 --> 00:51:51,578
Me too...

721
00:51:57,761 --> 00:52:04,030
Oh Rahul! Promise we won't fight
like other married couples!!

722
00:52:05,035 --> 00:52:06,229
I promise...

723
00:52:11,308 --> 00:52:14,368
Don't cry 'Pushpa'! I hate tears!

724
00:52:16,947 --> 00:52:18,972
You want to go inside?
- Or you want to cry some more!

725
00:52:19,049 --> 00:52:20,311
No... Lets go!!

726
00:52:33,497 --> 00:52:35,727
You know... you drive quite
well for a woman...

727
00:52:37,601 --> 00:52:40,001
No no... its not that
women can't drive.

728
00:52:40,604 --> 00:52:43,072
They just don't get much
opportunity you know...

729
00:52:50,747 --> 00:52:53,375
If you don't know how to
drive let me drive!!

730
00:52:53,550 --> 00:52:54,881
There was a rabbit here Rahul!

731
00:52:54,952 --> 00:52:57,750
Well you cant possibly make
a mistake can you??

732
00:52:57,821 --> 00:52:59,686
Now it's the poor rabbit's fault!

733
00:52:59,756 --> 00:53:01,280
Oh god! Don't be absurd!

734
00:53:01,358 --> 00:53:02,382
Stop it!

735
00:53:02,659 --> 00:53:03,751
Stop this fighting!

736
00:53:03,827 --> 00:53:05,692
You guys fight but I'm
the one who bangs...

737
00:53:06,363 --> 00:53:08,297
...his head and gets messed up!!

738
00:53:12,336 --> 00:53:14,463
And when I fell messed up,
I need to drink tea!

739
00:53:14,905 --> 00:53:15,929
Now Get down!

740
00:53:17,374 --> 00:53:18,636
Didn't you hear?!

741
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:31,353
Fried my brains completely!

742
00:53:36,493 --> 00:53:37,926
Ok... lets change the
subject... hmmm...

743
00:53:40,430 --> 00:53:41,954
Ya! That seems good!

744
00:53:43,534 --> 00:53:45,695
Do you like sports?

745
00:53:46,970 --> 00:53:51,407
I like sports after all its
because of sports I fell in love

746
00:53:53,777 --> 00:53:55,574
Because of sports that
I met my Muskaan...

747
00:53:56,280 --> 00:54:00,011
Muskaan? - My wife to be...
very good in sports she is.

748
00:54:00,651 --> 00:54:02,642
One day day... I was walking
down a lane...

749
00:54:09,459 --> 00:54:11,757
When suddenly out of nowhere a
'Gillie' came flying and wham!

750
00:54:11,828 --> 00:54:13,352
Hit me on the head right here!

751
00:54:27,377 --> 00:54:28,639
Why did you come this way?

752
00:54:28,712 --> 00:54:30,907
Can't you see we're playing
'Gillie-danda'?

753
00:54:31,515 --> 00:54:32,948
Did you have to walk down here?

754
00:54:33,684 --> 00:54:35,914
If I hadn't come this way how
would I have ever seen you?

755
00:54:38,488 --> 00:54:39,512
What's your name?

756
00:54:40,857 --> 00:54:41,881
Gillie!

757
00:54:42,492 --> 00:54:43,516
Gillie??

758
00:54:43,727 --> 00:54:45,319
Give back my ' Gillie' please!

759
00:54:45,529 --> 00:54:48,327
Oh! Sorry... I thought your
'Name' was 'Gillie'

760
00:54:48,865 --> 00:54:49,991
What??!?!

761
00:54:57,274 --> 00:54:58,298
Are you hurt bad?

762
00:54:58,442 --> 00:54:59,466
Thanks...

763
00:55:01,478 --> 00:55:02,968
Not here...

764
00:55:04,414 --> 00:55:05,438
But here...

765
00:55:17,794 --> 00:55:18,886
She kept laughing...

766
00:55:19,863 --> 00:55:21,330
And I kept falling... for her...

767
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:26,360
Do you both have any idea how
lucky those people are...

768
00:55:26,703 --> 00:55:29,399
Who love someone and that very
same person loves them back??

769
00:55:29,473 --> 00:55:31,270
I mean think about it... of
all the millions...

770
00:55:31,341 --> 00:55:32,569
...of people on this planet...

771
00:55:32,643 --> 00:55:35,578
It isn't necessary that just
because I loved Muskaan...

772
00:55:35,646 --> 00:55:37,273
...Muskaan should love me too??

773
00:55:37,748 --> 00:55:39,909
I mean, She could've loved
someone else right?

774
00:55:40,050 --> 00:55:41,677
But she loves ME!!

775
00:55:42,753 --> 00:55:45,847
And THAT is destiny... and
who can fight destiny

776
00:55:46,323 --> 00:55:48,314
But foolish people
try to fight it...

777
00:55:48,492 --> 00:55:50,016
Take Muskaan's brother
and her family!

778
00:55:51,628 --> 00:55:53,721
They don't approve of me... Why?

779
00:55:53,930 --> 00:55:55,454
I'm not from the same caste them!

780
00:55:55,532 --> 00:55:57,397
Morons! So what if our
castes are different!

781
00:55:57,501 --> 00:55:58,729
Our hearts are one! Huh...

782
00:55:59,536 --> 00:56:01,697
I left for Gaggal on work and
they decided to forcefully...

783
00:56:01,772 --> 00:56:03,569
...get her engaged to
someone else!!

784
00:56:04,541 --> 00:56:06,600
...that's why I need to reach
Shimla by 4 tomorrow...

785
00:56:06,677 --> 00:56:08,611
...at all costs to stop that
darn engagement!

786
00:56:08,945 --> 00:56:09,969
...fools...

787
00:56:10,213 --> 00:56:12,647
Let me see... who dares try to
keep me from my Muskaan??!!

788
00:56:12,983 --> 00:56:14,382
When Jai loves, he loves!!

789
00:56:20,957 --> 00:56:24,916
And unlike you we never
fight... no way!!

790
00:56:25,796 --> 00:56:27,923
We solve all the problems
by discussing them!

791
00:56:28,331 --> 00:56:30,765
Now e. G! See... I hate
drinking milk...

792
00:56:31,635 --> 00:56:32,966
But then one day Muskaan said...

793
00:56:33,403 --> 00:56:35,928
You should have a glass
of milk every night

794
00:56:36,907 --> 00:56:40,308
So I said... one glass??

795
00:56:40,844 --> 00:56:41,970
She said... Yes

796
00:56:42,913 --> 00:56:45,279
So I said...
7 o'clock or 8 o'clock?

797
00:56:46,516 --> 00:56:48,006
She said 8 o'clock
so I said Done!

798
00:56:48,652 --> 00:56:50,017
Where is the need to fight huh??

799
00:56:51,555 --> 00:56:52,647
Uff... shall we go?

800
00:56:53,924 --> 00:56:57,792
And remember... discussion... no
fighting!

801
00:57:06,570 --> 00:57:08,504
Why do you keep this gun?

802
00:57:10,674 --> 00:57:12,938
Muskaan's brother is a goon!

803
00:57:13,577 --> 00:57:15,511
Well I'm no coward either!

804
00:57:16,646 --> 00:57:18,204
Muskaan and I have taken an oath

805
00:57:19,015 --> 00:57:21,540
We will die but never allow
anyone to separate us

806
00:57:23,887 --> 00:57:27,379
Without the vows... l'm
all yours...

807
00:57:31,261 --> 00:57:34,958
Anyway... tell me... your wife
looks very strict

808
00:57:35,565 --> 00:57:37,965
Was she the headmistress of a
school before you married her?

809
00:57:50,580 --> 00:57:51,604
But...

810
00:58:28,885 --> 00:58:31,820
God! - You didn't clean-up
after cooking Rahul?

811
00:58:33,290 --> 00:58:35,622
I did looks like you will
have to be taught...

812
00:58:35,859 --> 00:58:37,417
...everything is littered all over.

813
00:58:37,761 --> 00:58:39,285
Why are you so messy??

814
00:58:40,030 --> 00:58:41,429
Why are you so fussy??

815
00:58:41,765 --> 00:58:44,029
After all I cooked for you, you...

816
00:58:44,301 --> 00:58:45,325
One minute...

817
00:58:48,505 --> 00:58:51,030
After all... I cooked
for you means?

818
00:58:52,042 --> 00:58:55,034
Here I was impressed that you
believe in equality...

819
00:58:55,445 --> 00:58:57,470
But now it looks like you did
me a favour by cooking!

820
00:58:57,681 --> 00:58:58,807
It was equality Pooja...

821
00:58:58,882 --> 00:58:59,974
Thank you very much...

822
00:59:00,483 --> 00:59:02,508
I hope so...
- When we need salt tomorrow...

823
00:59:02,586 --> 00:59:04,850
...we'll have to look for
all over it... wont we?

824
00:59:04,921 --> 00:59:05,945
Big deal Pooja...

825
00:59:06,523 --> 00:59:08,388
It shows the attitude Rahul.

826
00:59:08,758 --> 00:59:11,955
A messy person has a messy mind!

827
00:59:12,229 --> 00:59:13,992
Why are you making such a
big deal about it?!??!!

828
00:59:14,631 --> 00:59:17,930
And don't worry! - You won't have
to look for anything for me...

829
00:59:18,001 --> 00:59:19,491
Now can we please go to sleep?

830
00:59:32,249 --> 00:59:35,412
It's hot... what the temperature?
- 25.

831
00:59:35,585 --> 00:59:37,883
25! God... no wonder... can
we make it 20 please?

832
00:59:38,255 --> 00:59:40,621
20?!! Were you an Eskimo
in your last birth?

833
00:59:40,891 --> 00:59:42,290
And were you a lizard??

834
01:00:21,831 --> 01:00:24,925
Hooray hurray... it's
a holi-Holi-day!

835
01:00:25,001 --> 01:00:28,300
Hooray hurray... it's
a holi-Holi-day!

836
01:00:28,471 --> 01:00:31,463
Hooray hurray... it's a
holi-Holi-day! Look for it...

837
01:00:45,288 --> 01:00:46,915
Why can't you tell me where it is?

838
01:00:46,990 --> 01:00:48,389
Where did you keep it?

839
01:00:48,458 --> 01:00:49,925
Why would I ask if I knew that?

840
01:00:49,993 --> 01:00:51,517
Where SHOULD you have kept it?

841
01:00:54,998 --> 01:00:56,488
You know you are disgusting!

842
01:00:57,367 --> 01:00:58,994
You should've been
a school teacher!

843
01:00:59,402 --> 01:01:00,994
And you should have
been a Kg student!

844
01:01:03,006 --> 01:01:06,703
Here... and now you'll
have to drive...

845
01:01:07,010 --> 01:01:09,376
Thanks to you I haven't slept
a wink last night...

846
01:01:09,579 --> 01:01:11,570
I'll drive from 2 o'clock ok?

847
01:01:12,248 --> 01:01:13,977
Yes miss. Ok miss.

848
01:01:35,805 --> 01:01:38,740
Nako? You won't find a single
petrol pump for...

849
01:01:39,342 --> 01:01:42,038
...at least 400 km... you
should take 4 cans.

850
01:01:42,379 --> 01:01:45,348
And be careful please... there's
a temple up ahead...

851
01:01:45,415 --> 01:01:46,643
Do stop and pray,

852
01:01:46,883 --> 01:01:48,783
lt'll keep bad luck at bay!

853
01:02:13,410 --> 01:02:15,037
Poor things... look like
their motorcycle...

854
01:02:15,278 --> 01:02:16,643
...has broken down... stop stop!

855
01:02:16,746 --> 01:02:18,646
Who knows what kind of
people they are Pooja?

856
01:02:18,715 --> 01:02:20,307
If anything happens on the highway
no one would even know...

857
01:02:20,383 --> 01:02:22,749
! What will happen? ...we could
have been stranded here too...

858
01:02:22,819 --> 01:02:24,309
And didn't the guy at
the petrol pump say...

859
01:02:24,387 --> 01:02:25,945
...that there's nothing
for miles ahead?

860
01:02:29,459 --> 01:02:30,483
Hi! Can we help?

861
01:02:30,660 --> 01:02:34,596
Yeah man... sure... the nearest
mechanic is 200km away. Get in.

862
01:02:34,931 --> 01:02:38,389
Thanks man Oh... I am Arjun
and this is Geetanjali.

863
01:02:44,641 --> 01:02:45,665
Rahul...

864
01:02:48,578 --> 01:02:49,602
Pooja.

865
01:02:50,613 --> 01:02:51,637
His wife!

866
01:02:53,883 --> 01:02:55,578
Aw man... warm beds...

867
01:02:56,019 --> 01:02:58,419
We've been on that horse
for 14 hrs now!

868
01:02:58,488 --> 01:03:00,353
Go for it... what time
should I wake you?

869
01:03:01,324 --> 01:03:02,348
2 hrs?

870
01:03:02,859 --> 01:03:06,693
Do you have a cell phone?
Yeah sure... - 9833385226

871
01:03:08,264 --> 01:03:10,892
If you need anything,
just give me a buzz... l'll stop ok?

872
01:03:12,435 --> 01:03:13,925
Cheers man! Thanks!

873
01:03:20,510 --> 01:03:21,807
They look like nice people!

874
01:03:42,831 --> 01:03:44,628
Coffee? - Oh thanks!

875
01:03:52,574 --> 01:03:53,734
Oh... sorry!

876
01:03:57,146 --> 01:03:59,444
So where were you guys headed?

877
01:03:59,681 --> 01:04:01,512
Spiti... Para-gliding...

878
01:04:02,451 --> 01:04:03,975
Very strong winds
there... it'll be...

879
01:04:04,053 --> 01:04:05,645
...a totally different experience!

880
01:04:07,890 --> 01:04:09,881
You know when I was in college... I
really wanted...

881
01:04:10,192 --> 01:04:12,160
...to take my bike and travel
around the world...

882
01:04:12,961 --> 01:04:15,657
But my mom is the hyper kind!

883
01:04:16,498 --> 01:04:19,592
Hey have you ever noticed?
As life moves on...

884
01:04:19,802 --> 01:04:22,965
Parents become children
and children parents??

885
01:04:23,739 --> 01:04:25,536
Yeah like when we were
kids... they used to...

886
01:04:25,607 --> 01:04:27,097
...constantly tell us-Do this,
do that...

887
01:04:27,276 --> 01:04:29,904
...now... we have to stop them... '

888
01:04:30,412 --> 01:04:33,040
Only one rasgullas-You'll
get diabetes'...

889
01:04:33,649 --> 01:04:35,446
Strange isn't it?

890
01:04:37,219 --> 01:04:39,983
Anyway... I love speed.

891
01:04:40,589 --> 01:04:44,525
It's almost like...
riding a wild horse!

892
01:04:46,895 --> 01:04:49,455
Hey does anyone remember
that song??

893
01:04:50,799 --> 01:04:55,031
O Horse flying with the wind...

894
01:04:56,238 --> 01:05:00,766
The one who rides
you is my beloved

895
01:05:01,009 --> 01:05:04,945
Take care of him

896
01:05:05,247 --> 01:05:09,013
O horse flying with the wind...

897
01:05:12,788 --> 01:05:14,483
You know... you're the
first person...

898
01:05:14,556 --> 01:05:15,989
...l've met who knows this song!!

899
01:05:16,558 --> 01:05:18,719
Actually,
I played the role of Rana...

900
01:05:18,794 --> 01:05:21,661
...Pratap as a kid in school...
- When I was a small lad!

901
01:05:21,730 --> 01:05:23,891
God! Really??!! That was
my first play too!!!

902
01:05:23,966 --> 01:05:26,764
I played Rana Pratap's wife!!

903
01:05:27,136 --> 01:05:29,036
How bizzare!
- Which school were you in?

904
01:05:29,505 --> 01:05:33,464
St.
Joseph! - Oh my god! St. Joseph?!

905
01:05:34,510 --> 01:05:36,478
Which year did you pass out?

906
01:05:36,545 --> 01:05:39,105
1997! - And I in 1998!!

907
01:05:41,917 --> 01:05:44,852
Now I remember... you
played Rana Pratap!

908
01:05:45,921 --> 01:05:48,515
Lmagine fate man!

909
01:05:48,957 --> 01:05:51,926
After all these years... we
meet here... on this road!

910
01:05:52,628 --> 01:05:54,653
Freaked out!!

911
01:05:57,599 --> 01:06:00,500
So... Arjun... which school
did you go to?

912
01:06:01,236 --> 01:06:02,635
Delhi public school...

913
01:06:03,038 --> 01:06:04,596
I'm actually a painter...

914
01:06:04,673 --> 01:06:06,231
And a great singer...

915
01:06:07,176 --> 01:06:09,804
So you're a painter?
- And a singer...

916
01:06:09,878 --> 01:06:11,743
Singer!!! Really?!

917
01:06:14,550 --> 01:06:17,644
If the sun refused to shine...

918
01:06:19,955 --> 01:06:22,549
I would still be loving you...

919
01:06:25,227 --> 01:06:28,788
And when the mountains
tumble to the sea,

920
01:06:30,899 --> 01:06:34,630
There would just be you and me...

921
01:06:36,939 --> 01:06:38,600
This isn't right.

922
01:06:39,741 --> 01:06:41,732
An unknown beautiful girl...

923
01:06:42,544 --> 01:06:43,841
...always spells trouble.

924
01:06:45,214 --> 01:06:46,704
Will you listen to me or not??

925
01:06:46,949 --> 01:06:48,576
You're son is going
to get divorced!!

926
01:06:48,917 --> 01:06:51,909
Uf... haven't you taught any
sense to your son...

927
01:06:51,987 --> 01:06:53,545
...you think he is going
to chase another...

928
01:06:53,622 --> 01:06:56,648
...woman on his own honeymoon?
- Hullo... Don't blame My Son

929
01:06:56,925 --> 01:06:58,825
All you men are alike!!

930
01:06:59,228 --> 01:07:02,561
Don't you remember? When we went
on our honeymoon in 1965?

931
01:07:02,764 --> 01:07:03,822
To Darjeeling?

932
01:07:04,499 --> 01:07:08,230
What about that Radha??
- Huh??? - which Radha?

933
01:07:08,904 --> 01:07:10,963
The girl in the pink skirt!
- It's been 30 years!

934
01:07:11,073 --> 01:07:13,064
But you still haven't forgotten
that pink skirt...

935
01:07:13,141 --> 01:07:14,733
And it was Purple! Not pink!

936
01:07:21,049 --> 01:07:22,607
Hey anyone for a drink?

937
01:07:23,252 --> 01:07:24,651
At 11 in the morning??

938
01:07:24,820 --> 01:07:26,481
Hey! We're on a holiday right??

939
01:07:26,555 --> 01:07:27,852
Anyway... its not like
death visits...

940
01:07:27,923 --> 01:07:29,550
...us according to a timetable!!!

941
01:07:29,825 --> 01:07:32,794
Absolutely! - Cheers!

942
01:07:43,672 --> 01:07:44,764
No, thanks.

943
01:07:51,146 --> 01:07:52,204
Cheers!

944
01:07:56,418 --> 01:07:57,646
Now that's called living!

945
01:07:58,520 --> 01:08:00,454
You know... One should have
your attitude in life!

946
01:08:17,139 --> 01:08:20,734
Your smile is so infectious
can't take my eyes off you.

947
01:08:41,029 --> 01:08:44,726
Your smile is so infectious...
can't take my eyes off you...

948
01:08:50,772 --> 01:08:51,932
What's on the cell?

949
01:08:54,209 --> 01:08:57,440
The cell? What? Nothing?!

950
01:08:57,813 --> 01:08:59,178
So then why are you hiding it?

951
01:09:00,949 --> 01:09:02,507
Why would I hide it?

952
01:09:06,488 --> 01:09:09,048
Don't be so childish! And
I don't like distrust!

953
01:09:09,124 --> 01:09:10,523
If my distrust is
unfounded... then...

954
01:09:10,592 --> 01:09:12,025
...where's the harm in showing it...

955
01:09:14,596 --> 01:09:15,961
This is ridiculous.

956
01:09:18,867 --> 01:09:20,630
Why are you laughing
like a hyena?

957
01:09:20,969 --> 01:09:22,436
Correct me if I'm wrong...

958
01:09:22,504 --> 01:09:24,131
10 days ago...
who was it that was saying...

959
01:09:24,239 --> 01:09:26,537
Oh Rahul... your laugh
is so infectious!

960
01:09:26,742 --> 01:09:28,073
And now I laugh like a hyena!!??

961
01:09:28,143 --> 01:09:30,703
The rules of war have changed
long back dude! - War?!

962
01:09:31,113 --> 01:09:33,638
Do you even know what you
are saying??? - What war?

963
01:09:33,749 --> 01:09:35,182
The one that YOU started!!

964
01:09:35,417 --> 01:09:36,441
Now show me!!

965
01:09:40,856 --> 01:09:44,019
Your smile is so infectious...
can't take my eyes off you...

966
01:09:57,439 --> 01:09:59,430
She is just funs Pooja... don't
over react... l...

967
01:09:59,508 --> 01:10:00,634
...haven't even laid
a finger on her!

968
01:10:00,709 --> 01:10:03,200
Maybe... but you've thought
about it for sure...

969
01:10:03,845 --> 01:10:05,938
You're having an emotional
affair!!

970
01:10:06,448 --> 01:10:08,541
Are you crazy?
What the hell is that?

971
01:10:08,784 --> 01:10:09,842
You know very well...

972
01:10:10,419 --> 01:10:13,217
Swear there's nothing emotional
there... its only physical!

973
01:10:15,590 --> 01:10:19,583
I mean... - good night! Have 'Fun'!

974
01:10:19,895 --> 01:10:21,658
Pooja! Pooja!

975
01:11:42,777 --> 01:11:44,972
Did you dunk my cell
phone in water???

976
01:11:48,016 --> 01:11:50,177
Great! Now it's not working!!

977
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:52,544
Tsk! Tsk! Tsk!

978
01:11:52,621 --> 01:11:55,920
Poor Rahu! Now how will
geetanjali send a message...

979
01:11:57,058 --> 01:11:59,083
Your laugh is soooo infectious!!

980
01:12:07,569 --> 01:12:08,831
Oh god!

981
01:12:11,907 --> 01:12:14,808
Are you crazy??!!! Now we
don't have any phone!

982
01:12:15,010 --> 01:12:16,443
What if something happens??

983
01:12:16,711 --> 01:12:17,871
How could you Rahul??!!

984
01:12:32,994 --> 01:12:35,724
What we can do,
and what we do... do...

985
01:12:35,964 --> 01:12:38,956
Depends on what we don't see...

986
01:12:39,734 --> 01:12:42,703
And because we haven't seen it
...we can't even change it...

987
01:12:43,538 --> 01:12:45,631
So till the time we don't see,

988
01:12:45,907 --> 01:12:47,807
What we haven't seen...

989
01:12:48,009 --> 01:12:49,772
...we will keep on doing
what we are doing!!

990
01:12:50,879 --> 01:12:52,403
Amazing!

991
01:12:54,983 --> 01:12:56,450
What a thought!

992
01:13:03,391 --> 01:13:04,688
Hippie's-wisdom!

993
01:13:07,796 --> 01:13:09,491
Hey! Beautiful!

994
01:13:09,764 --> 01:13:10,788
Morning...

995
01:13:16,171 --> 01:13:17,934
...good morning!

996
01:13:18,707 --> 01:13:19,935
Hey Arjun!

997
01:13:20,008 --> 01:13:22,772
Will you teach me paragliding?

998
01:13:22,877 --> 01:13:24,742
Of course! Let's go right now!

999
01:13:37,692 --> 01:13:39,853
Is this... safe?

1000
01:13:39,928 --> 01:13:41,953
You're driving down there right?

1001
01:13:42,030 --> 01:13:43,156
Well... there are more
chances of your...

1002
01:13:43,231 --> 01:13:44,789
...having an accident than us!!

1003
01:13:45,834 --> 01:13:52,467
Come Pooja... now now... run
run! Now now now!!!

1004
01:13:55,677 --> 01:13:57,008
How long will it take?

1005
01:13:57,212 --> 01:13:58,474
Mmm... half an hour?

1006
01:14:02,450 --> 01:14:08,821
Pooja you are a free bird!

1007
01:14:24,005 --> 01:14:27,497
Hurray hurray it's
a holi-Holi-day!

1008
01:14:27,976 --> 01:14:29,773
Hey! That was grrreat!

1009
01:14:30,612 --> 01:14:32,807
How long will you be?

1010
01:14:33,448 --> 01:14:35,006
Why?? - I want to change.

1011
01:14:35,450 --> 01:14:37,475
Arjun's waiting for me...

1012
01:14:45,193 --> 01:14:48,219
Are you trying to make me jealous?

1013
01:14:50,098 --> 01:14:54,159
Rahul! Everything doesn't
begin and end with you??

1014
01:14:54,936 --> 01:14:57,962
Ohhh... would you like me
to send Arjun in??

1015
01:14:59,207 --> 01:15:01,437
Send him... you too will
get a chance to sing...

1016
01:15:01,509 --> 01:15:04,478
...about the Horse who rides the
wind too with Geetanjali!

1017
01:15:04,913 --> 01:15:07,438
God! You are so transparent!

1018
01:15:09,150 --> 01:15:12,881
And next time don't try
sarcasm with me!!

1019
01:15:14,022 --> 01:15:15,717
Don't shout!

1020
01:15:16,257 --> 01:15:18,748
Do you want to tell the
world about our tiffs?

1021
01:15:20,962 --> 01:15:23,055
So Geetanjali's your world now?

1022
01:15:23,732 --> 01:15:26,963
I'll say things they way I want
to... whenever I want to!

1023
01:15:34,743 --> 01:15:36,210
Coming 'Geetu'!

1024
01:15:50,024 --> 01:15:52,549
Hey!
Why are you guys so quiet today?

1025
01:15:56,464 --> 01:15:57,488
No? Nothing...

1026
01:15:57,565 --> 01:16:01,228
Life is about fun and play...
it is fleeting, it is short...

1027
01:16:05,106 --> 01:16:12,842
Life is about fun and play...
it is fleeting, it is short...

1028
01:16:13,114 --> 01:16:16,481
Don't lose it...
if you do don't cry...

1029
01:16:16,551 --> 01:16:18,781
Don't lose it...
if you do don't cry... - I'm tired!

1030
01:16:20,054 --> 01:16:21,681
And want to turn in early...

1031
01:16:23,224 --> 01:16:25,089
We'll reach Loori tomorrow...

1032
01:16:29,430 --> 01:16:31,398
What time do you want to
start in the morning?

1033
01:16:35,203 --> 01:16:36,397
8.30?

1034
01:16:37,105 --> 01:16:38,129
8.30

1035
01:16:38,807 --> 01:16:39,831
Ok...

1036
01:16:53,154 --> 01:16:54,416
Pooja...

1037
01:16:54,756 --> 01:16:55,916
Pooja...

1038
01:16:56,224 --> 01:16:58,624
Pooja... have you seen Arjun
and Geetanjali? No...

1039
01:16:59,561 --> 01:17:01,791
No... - They're both missing...

1040
01:17:02,697 --> 01:17:03,994
Their bags are missing too...

1041
01:17:05,233 --> 01:17:06,962
...did you see my wallet
anywhere?

1042
01:17:07,035 --> 01:17:09,060
...l'd kept it right here Pooja...
I swear! Carefully.

1043
01:17:22,917 --> 01:17:26,512
If we ever run into each other
someday... somewhere... then...

1044
01:17:26,588 --> 01:17:27,555
...lOU 30,000...

1045
01:17:28,089 --> 01:17:29,989
Thank you, Arjun and Geetanjali

1046
01:17:30,725 --> 01:17:32,420
Bloody darn!!

1047
01:17:32,794 --> 01:17:34,887
30,000!!!

1048
01:17:35,163 --> 01:17:37,791
They fooled us for 30,000!!!

1049
01:17:41,202 --> 01:17:44,865
O Horse flying with the wind...

1050
01:17:45,506 --> 01:17:48,532
Oh you're the first person
who knows s this song...

1051
01:17:49,911 --> 01:17:52,402
...Well... not a horse,
you turned out be a royal ass!!

1052
01:17:52,747 --> 01:17:53,771
And you??

1053
01:17:54,082 --> 01:17:56,915
Arjun... will you teach
me Bungee jumping??

1054
01:17:56,985 --> 01:17:58,475
Para-gliding... Same difference!

1055
01:18:00,188 --> 01:18:02,156
You're the one who wanted
to give them a lift!

1056
01:18:02,223 --> 01:18:04,783
I told you to give them a lift
not make her sit in your lap...

1057
01:18:04,893 --> 01:18:07,521
...now we don't have any money MR.
Rana Pratap!!!

1058
01:18:13,001 --> 01:18:14,628
How dare you??!!

1059
01:18:15,637 --> 01:18:17,662
What do you mean by Shut up??!!

1060
01:18:18,473 --> 01:18:20,634
Nobody talks to me like that...
understand!!??

1061
01:18:24,979 --> 01:18:27,447
Don't you ever be violent
in front of me!

1062
01:18:28,583 --> 01:18:32,519
This bullying neither impresses
me nor scares ME!!!!

1063
01:18:35,757 --> 01:18:39,818
And neither can your 'High
pitched' voice shut me up!!

1064
01:18:40,929 --> 01:18:43,693
I can be melodramatic too!!!

1065
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:46,897
Ditto!

1066
01:18:48,036 --> 01:18:49,435
Ditto!

1067
01:18:50,505 --> 01:18:52,473
Ditto! - Double ditto!

1068
01:19:28,509 --> 01:19:31,569
Hmmmmm... now I know how
to shut you up...

1069
01:19:35,183 --> 01:19:38,619
...I haven't heard a bigger MCP
statement than that ever!

1070
01:19:39,721 --> 01:19:41,882
Pooja... - Please!

1071
01:19:54,402 --> 01:19:56,529
I've never seen such childish
behavior in my life!

1072
01:19:56,704 --> 01:19:58,467
Exactly! Nor me!

1073
01:20:00,008 --> 01:20:01,032
What?

1074
01:20:01,109 --> 01:20:03,043
When has violence ever
solved anything?

1075
01:20:03,211 --> 01:20:05,975
If you have a temper... go
show it to your 'Mummy'!

1076
01:20:06,714 --> 01:20:09,615
That's what I did...
'Mummy' Teresa!

1077
01:20:19,527 --> 01:20:21,961
Step on it!
Step on it! Drive faster!!

1078
01:20:25,867 --> 01:20:27,596
Step on it!
Step on it! Drive faster!!

1079
01:20:34,575 --> 01:20:40,514
No use... we won't make it even
by 5!! It's too late now...

1080
01:20:41,182 --> 01:20:43,013
Muskaan isn't answering
her phone either!!

1081
01:20:45,987 --> 01:20:49,616
Muskaan! L've been calling
you forever...

1082
01:20:49,924 --> 01:20:51,391
What???!!!!

1083
01:20:53,761 --> 01:20:54,955
6 o'clock?

1084
01:20:57,765 --> 01:21:01,394
Listen... you meet me at Manali...

1085
01:21:01,803 --> 01:21:04,033
At 5... on the same bridge...

1086
01:21:04,839 --> 01:21:10,505
Ya ay... don't cry love... l'm
coming!!

1087
01:21:11,512 --> 01:21:12,945
Turn the van around... turn
it around!

1088
01:21:13,181 --> 01:21:17,948
What do you mean? What happened?

1089
01:21:18,519 --> 01:21:21,886
She's already engaged!
- Now we need to stop the wedding!!

1090
01:21:21,956 --> 01:21:23,617
We need to reach Manali! Before
5!!

1091
01:21:24,559 --> 01:21:26,993
Are you nuts??!!
Manali is a 15hr drive!!

1092
01:21:27,061 --> 01:21:29,495
Ya... so what can I do?? If
you two hadn't fought...

1093
01:21:29,564 --> 01:21:31,395
...so much we would've
reached hours ago!!!

1094
01:21:31,666 --> 01:21:33,725
I'm sorry... l'm not going
to Manali... no way!!

1095
01:21:33,801 --> 01:21:35,063
The hell, you won't go??!!

1096
01:21:35,136 --> 01:21:36,899
My Muskaan will be married
off to someone else!!

1097
01:21:36,971 --> 01:21:39,030
Call it Divine intervention
!! You'll be saved!!

1098
01:21:39,574 --> 01:21:41,565
What else could an MCP say...

1099
01:21:41,676 --> 01:21:42,802
Me? MCP?!

1100
01:21:42,910 --> 01:21:45,811
Shut up!!
IF you get me late this time...

1101
01:21:46,147 --> 01:21:47,876
I'll break your bones into bits!!

1102
01:21:48,149 --> 01:21:49,480
I promise.

1103
01:21:49,584 --> 01:21:52,451
NOW TURN THE VAN TOWARDS MANALI!!
Turn it!

1104
01:22:07,101 --> 01:22:08,500
Tell me something...

1105
01:22:08,870 --> 01:22:10,633
How did the two of you
end up in Gaggal...

1106
01:22:10,705 --> 01:22:12,195
...in the first place... huh??!!

1107
01:22:18,613 --> 01:22:20,513
Ok... now a left from here...

1108
01:22:22,884 --> 01:22:25,648
Hey!!! ...The road on the
left looks too small...

1109
01:22:26,053 --> 01:22:27,418
It's look like a main road...

1110
01:22:28,122 --> 01:22:31,421
God! Give me some patience!

1111
01:22:46,140 --> 01:22:47,164
Dead-end!

1112
01:22:58,953 --> 01:23:02,013
It was written on the map too
Rahul... left... you never listen!

1113
01:23:13,034 --> 01:23:14,058
Darn!

1114
01:23:16,137 --> 01:23:17,570
What are you doing??

1115
01:23:20,208 --> 01:23:21,732
What are you laughing at?!

1116
01:24:23,571 --> 01:24:24,936
We need to turn around...

1117
01:24:25,273 --> 01:24:27,036
How shall we do it?

1118
01:24:41,422 --> 01:24:43,890
Come come...

1119
01:24:44,225 --> 01:24:46,523
Ya slowly... turn turn...

1120
01:24:46,727 --> 01:24:48,752
One more foot...

1121
01:24:49,964 --> 01:24:53,491
Go on -Stop stop POOJA!!!

1122
01:26:21,789 --> 01:26:24,451
That's enough...

1123
01:26:25,559 --> 01:26:27,925
I don't think I can travel
with you anymore...

1124
01:26:29,897 --> 01:26:31,865
I think we've had enough
drama for today Pooja...

1125
01:26:32,400 --> 01:26:33,492
Drama??

1126
01:26:33,868 --> 01:26:34,926
Drama Rahul??

1127
01:26:38,773 --> 01:26:41,606
Because Rahul is never wrong!!!

1128
01:26:42,209 --> 01:26:43,506
Pooja is an idiot!!

1129
01:26:43,744 --> 01:26:45,939
And the map!! Ha! That was
made by another idiot!!!

1130
01:26:46,914 --> 01:26:48,609
Why do you speak so loudly??

1131
01:26:48,883 --> 01:26:50,475
Were you fed crows as a child!!??

1132
01:26:50,751 --> 01:26:52,412
And please don't be hysterical...

1133
01:26:52,586 --> 01:26:54,850
I cannot tolerate hysterical
women!!

1134
01:26:54,922 --> 01:26:56,514
And I cannot stand arrogant men...

1135
01:26:56,757 --> 01:26:57,951
...infact you know what???

1136
01:26:58,225 --> 01:27:01,160
I saw a travel agent
about 50km back...

1137
01:27:01,529 --> 01:27:03,121
Lets end this farce right now!!

1138
01:27:03,197 --> 01:27:05,097
I agree!! Lets end this farce!

1139
01:27:05,466 --> 01:27:06,797
AND this stupid marriage!!

1140
01:27:07,468 --> 01:27:08,867
I didn't ask you to get married!!

1141
01:27:09,437 --> 01:27:11,530
But you did make the mistake
of saying yes didn't you...

1142
01:27:11,605 --> 01:27:12,697
...Miss Pooja Bhasin!!

1143
01:27:22,917 --> 01:27:23,975
Shall we go??!!

1144
01:27:25,519 --> 01:27:30,013
We call this 'Seet asana' in yoga!

1145
01:27:56,584 --> 01:27:59,985
Raju... er... we're coming

Can you send the car to the
airport... - coming back...

01:28:03,224 --> 01:28:05,215
...but you still have
5 more days to go??

1148

01:28:10,631 --> 01:28:12,826
Hey bro... hey... is

1150
01:28:13,634 --> 01:28:17,468
Listen... for now... don't say
anything to mummy and papa ok...

1151
01:28:17,838 --> 01:28:19,635
...just that we're coming back...

1152
01:28:21,842 --> 01:28:23,867
Bro...
- I'll talk to you later dude...

1153
01:28:27,081 --> 01:28:30,676
Hey you turned out to be smarter
than me for your age...

1154
01:28:31,185 --> 01:28:32,516
But bro...

1155
01:28:38,993 --> 01:28:40,893

Just leave them alone will you??

1161
01:28:56,911 --> 01:28:58,708
Even if they don't want
to fight... you...

1162
01:28:58,779 --> 01:29:00,178
...guys will make sure they do!!

1163
01:29:01,916 --> 01:29:03,941
Papa, the car needs to be
at the airport by 7:30...

1164
01:29:04,218 --> 01:29:05,651
And I am going to get them.

1165
01:29:11,825 --> 01:29:14,225

No Papa... nothing...

Ya mummy... - She's crying just

01:29:44,658 --> 01:29:46,785
She's not crazy mamma,

...to your Mamma dear
and Daddy dear!

1187
01:30:20,628 --> 01:30:22,562
And tell them not to
call me anymore...

1188
01:30:22,630 --> 01:30:25,064
...god knows where these phone
booth customers come from!

1189
01:30:44,551 --> 01:30:47,543
Isn't it sad Jai... how people
change after marriage?

1190
01:30:48,722 --> 01:30:51,190
For example... before we got
married... madam use to...

1191
01:30:51,425 --> 01:30:53,916
...say that I have a beautiful
infectious laugh...

1192
01:30:54,428 --> 01:30:56,919
Now she says I laugh
like a hyena!!

1193
01:30:57,131 --> 01:30:59,725
Oh... oh...

1194
01:30:59,800 --> 01:31:02,200
...you... it'll go up to
10 pages at least!!

1195
01:31:04,805 --> 01:31:07,638
Jai, have you ever seen
a tap... that keeps on...

1196
01:31:07,908 --> 01:31:10,433
...going drip drip drip
through the night...

1197
01:31:10,911 --> 01:31:12,606
...you know Pooja is
just like that...

1198
01:31:12,680 --> 01:31:14,705
No matter what I do!
I just can't shut her up!

1199
01:31:14,948 --> 01:31:18,679
Have you had a look at your
self? King of 'I I!

1200
01:31:19,553 --> 01:31:21,578
Queen of 'Crib

1201

01:31:32,900 --> 01:31:34,731

win the crown for...

1204
01:31:34,802 --> 01:31:36,565
...the most irritating
woman... Miss Universe!

Oh oh!

01:31:45,579 --> 01:31:47,513
...can count from 1-100!!

1208
01:31:47,581 --> 01:31:48,605
Hhaahaha!!!

1209
01:32:01,662 --> 01:32:02,959
You want to get us killed??

1210
01:32:03,964 --> 01:32:04,988
Don't touch me!

1211
01:32:05,532 --> 01:32:07,762
...you're lucky I don't raise
my hand on women!!

1212
01:32:07,868 --> 01:32:09,495
Don't run a riot!

1213
01:32:09,603 --> 01:32:11,935
Ya ya! I don't raise my hand... I

01:32:49,810 --> 01:32:51,641
Turn the car... - why??

1217
01:32:53,514 --> 01:32:55,607
Don't want to get married...
- what!!??

1218
01:32:56,016 --> 01:32:57,745
If this is what a marriage
is... then...

1219
01:32:57,818 --> 01:32:59,149
...I don't want to get married...

1220
01:32:59,486 --> 01:33:02,455
Jai... Muskaan has run away from
home... leaving everything...

1221
01:33:02,523 --> 01:33:04,457
...behind for you!! Where
will she go?

1222
01:33:04,691 --> 01:33:07,854
Are you deaf? I said I don't
want to get married!!

1223
01:33:07,928 --> 01:33:08,952
Now let me out!!

1224
01:33:13,534 --> 01:33:14,796
Rahul! The Gun!

1225
01:33:17,204 --> 01:33:20,662
Quiet! And no more nonsense
understands?? - Pooja! You go!

1226
01:33:21,408 --> 01:33:23,706
Any more nonsense and I'll smack
the daylights out of you!!

1227
01:33:23,777 --> 01:33:25,506
Muskaan!

1228
01:33:25,779 --> 01:33:27,679
Muskaan!

1229
01:33:43,664 --> 01:33:45,188
Goloo!

1230
01:33:49,236 --> 01:33:50,669
Goloo! I'm here!

1231
01:33:51,805 --> 01:33:52,999
Oooh I'm so excited...

1232
01:33:53,073 --> 01:33:54,472
...sorry... so worried... ah...

1233
01:33:54,808 --> 01:33:56,969
...as usual two opposite things
are happening to me!

1234
01:33:57,477 --> 01:34:00,071
Has it ever happened to you? It
can be so confusing?

1235
01:34:00,247 --> 01:34:03,239
. don't know if I'm happy to
see this punter here or

1236
01:34:04,451 --> 01:34:07,011
Worried... what if my brother
Veeru finds out?!

1237
01:34:07,087 --> 01:34:08,520
Then we're dead!

1238
01:34:09,056 --> 01:34:11,752
Jai! What happened Jai... on
your forehead...

1239
01:34:12,759 --> 01:34:14,750
...did Veeru bhaiya do something?

1240
01:34:15,495 --> 01:34:17,656
Jai, you're scaring me...

1241
01:34:17,898 --> 01:34:18,922
Is everything ok?

1242
01:34:19,099 --> 01:34:21,090
...he's speechless with happiness...

1243
01:34:21,235 --> 01:34:22,964
The whole journey all
he could talk...

1244
01:34:23,036 --> 01:34:24,628
...of was Muskaan
Muskaan Muskaan

1245
01:34:27,241 --> 01:34:29,709
I've told the Gondla Bijli
baba on my cell phone...

1246
01:34:29,877 --> 01:34:32,471
The priest will get us
both married at 6 pm...

1247
01:34:32,546 --> 01:34:33,945
Actually everything is ready...

1248
01:34:34,014 --> 01:34:36,778
You two must come to our wedding...
- You'll come right?

1249
01:34:36,850 --> 01:34:39,478
Come? We will be the ones
getting you married!

1250
01:34:39,853 --> 01:34:41,411
Goloo...

1251
01:34:41,955 --> 01:34:46,517
I've got you this shawl and
this sari for my!

1252
01:34:48,595 --> 01:34:51,063
It's very nice... Gillie...

1253
01:34:52,599 --> 01:34:54,726
I think we should...

1254
01:34:54,968 --> 01:34:57,493
Get married with a bang!
...promise!

1255
01:34:57,638 --> 01:35:01,699
Pooja! You go get Muskaan ready...

1256
01:35:01,775 --> 01:35:05,006
Next stop... uh... Gondla bijli baba!

1257
01:35:05,479 --> 01:35:07,504
Let me go!

1258
01:35:16,590 --> 01:35:17,989
There is no time for any henna

1259
01:35:18,492 --> 01:35:19,686
Of course there is...

1260
01:35:31,805 --> 01:35:33,466
The bride is ready my friend...

1261
01:35:34,908 --> 01:35:37,843
I... want to... see her...

1262
01:35:38,946 --> 01:35:41,608
They say you shouldn't see the
bride before the wedding...

1263
01:35:41,949 --> 01:35:44,076
...well this isn't any ordinary
wedding is it?

1264
01:35:45,485 --> 01:35:47,578
Go... go see your Muskaan...

1265
01:35:52,626 --> 01:35:54,958
Pooja... Jai's coming to you...

1266
01:36:00,500 --> 01:36:02,058
Hey! Wha? Jai!

1267
01:36:07,040 --> 01:36:10,976
Jai! Jai!

1268
01:36:13,480 --> 01:36:15,641
Jai! Jai!

1269
01:36:17,918 --> 01:36:18,942
Jai!!

1270
01:36:29,162 --> 01:36:30,561
Uff... how could you Rahul??

1271
01:36:30,764 --> 01:36:32,789
A man just runs away right
from under your nose and...

1272
01:36:32,866 --> 01:36:33,890
That's it!

1273
01:36:33,967 --> 01:36:35,696
...that's exactly why! If you
weren't such a fightercock...

1274
01:36:35,769 --> 01:36:37,862
...then Jai wouldn't have run
away from his own wedding!

1275
01:36:38,105 --> 01:36:39,402
...here they are!!

1276
01:36:57,791 --> 01:36:59,759
Yes, Rahul?
- Jai!! WHERE are you?

1277
01:36:59,960 --> 01:37:01,018
Muskaan...

1278
01:37:01,595 --> 01:37:04,655
What do I do with Muskaan in
the middle of the road???

1279
01:37:05,565 --> 01:37:09,001
Please... drop her back to her
brother Veeru at Shimla...

1280
01:37:11,638 --> 01:37:13,606
Back at Shimla???

1281
01:37:14,041 --> 01:37:15,804
No no no... you can't
do this to me... lf...

1282
01:37:15,876 --> 01:37:16,968
...you don't come back then I'm...

1283
01:37:17,044 --> 01:37:18,909
...going to make tiny
pieces out of...

1284
01:37:18,979 --> 01:37:20,640
...you and feed them
to the eagles!

1285
01:37:22,949 --> 01:37:23,973
Listen dear...

1286
01:37:28,955 --> 01:37:30,479
He hung up!

1287
01:37:34,561 --> 01:37:36,028
He hung on ME!!!?

1288
01:37:52,512 --> 01:37:55,913
...no... no Muskaan... no...

1289
01:37:57,851 --> 01:37:58,875
Do something!!

1290
01:37:59,419 --> 01:38:00,443
What can I do??!!

1291
01:38:03,757 --> 01:38:05,486
Don't cry like this
Muskaan... everything...

1292
01:38:05,559 --> 01:38:06,617
...will be alright... look...

1293
01:38:06,693 --> 01:38:08,820
...if he doesn't want to
marry you... then we'll...

1294
01:38:08,895 --> 01:38:10,795
Even his father will marry me!!!

1295
01:38:13,100 --> 01:38:14,465
I'd already warned him!

1296
01:38:14,668 --> 01:38:18,104
The mountain chilly maybe small
but so fiery sooo fiery!!

1297
01:38:18,171 --> 01:38:21,072
That the mightiest of
men get demolished!!

1298
01:38:25,112 --> 01:38:26,807
Now COME ON!!

1299
01:38:33,887 --> 01:38:35,718
But... where could he have gone?

1300
01:38:36,723 --> 01:38:38,850
He must be sitting at some
roadside cafe on this road...

1301
01:38:38,925 --> 01:38:43,385
Correct... Jai had said he needs
tea whenever he is rattled...

1302
01:38:43,463 --> 01:38:44,862
...Rahul...
you really think he's is going...

1303
01:38:44,931 --> 01:38:47,491
...to stop for tea at this time?
- He's right.

1304
01:38:49,069 --> 01:38:50,093
Greetings, sir!

1305
01:38:50,704 --> 01:38:52,934
Abe? - Hello... sorry... was
in a bit of a hurry...

1306
01:38:53,006 --> 01:38:54,667
...so couldn't really
ask you before...

1307
01:38:54,975 --> 01:38:56,943
...when would you be stopping
for some tea?

1308
01:38:59,679 --> 01:39:00,737
That's the truck!!

1309
01:39:01,047 --> 01:39:03,174
Stop! Stop!

1310
01:39:03,416 --> 01:39:04,974
Hey!
Hold on! Let me stop the van!

1311
01:39:05,619 --> 01:39:09,419
Muskaan! Hold on a moment! Wha-?

1312
01:39:12,425 --> 01:39:13,517
Jai!

1313
01:39:14,961 --> 01:39:16,223
Muskaan...

1314
01:39:19,699 --> 01:39:22,725
Stop right there! Or I'll...

1315
01:39:25,539 --> 01:39:27,439
I'll shoot myself! Stop
right there!!

1316
01:39:30,710 --> 01:39:31,734
Jai!

1317
01:39:39,186 --> 01:39:40,915
Jai, stop!

1318
01:39:48,929 --> 01:39:51,727
Please! Let me go!! I told you! I
don't want to get married!!!

1319
01:39:52,699 --> 01:39:53,859
Why not??!!

1320
01:39:57,571 --> 01:39:59,198
Tell me clearly... what
the problem is!!

1321
01:39:59,439 --> 01:40:00,463
Muskaan...

1322
01:40:01,641 --> 01:40:03,074
Marriage...
is a wrong institution...

1323
01:40:05,912 --> 01:40:08,847
...if we get married our love
will go 'Evaporate! '

1324
01:40:09,449 --> 01:40:11,815
'Evaporate?! ' They too
had a love marriage...

1325
01:40:11,918 --> 01:40:13,783
But I'm telling you... they'll
end up killing...

1326
01:40:13,853 --> 01:40:15,514
...each other by the
end of this year!

1327
01:40:15,689 --> 01:40:17,953
Kill each other... 'evaporate! '??

1328
01:40:18,124 --> 01:40:21,184
Have you ever seen a man who
makes such a ruckus...

1329
01:40:21,428 --> 01:40:23,726
...over... 'what could be'
and not what is??

1330
01:40:23,964 --> 01:40:25,693
I mean... we are all going
to die one day...

1331
01:40:25,765 --> 01:40:27,198
But does that mean
we stop living??

1332
01:40:27,434 --> 01:40:30,403
Arre when our love goes
'Evaporates' we'll see ok...

1333
01:40:30,837 --> 01:40:33,169
...and what are you doing
running around with...

1334
01:40:33,406 --> 01:40:35,499
...this gun?? Throw
it away... right now!

1335
01:40:36,776 --> 01:40:39,074
No!!! - Don't make me
angry! Give it here!!

1336
01:40:39,446 --> 01:40:41,414
You can't play with a gun!

1337
01:40:41,715 --> 01:40:43,774
Now c'mon!
- I WILL do whatever I want!

1338
01:40:46,019 --> 01:40:47,953
Now you'll come to Gondla
with me... understand??!!

1339
01:40:48,388 --> 01:40:49,719
Come on... say Done! - See?

1340
01:40:50,390 --> 01:40:53,587
She's giving me a list even
before we are married!

1341
01:40:54,828 --> 01:40:56,659
My dear Gillie... why don't
you do one thing...

1342
01:40:56,730 --> 01:40:58,163
...while you're at it... how
about giving...

1343
01:40:58,398 --> 01:40:59,490
...me a list of what and when...

1344
01:40:59,566 --> 01:41:00,760
...to do things so you
don't get mad...

1345
01:41:00,834 --> 01:41:02,529
...at me for the next 15 years??!!

1346
01:41:02,602 --> 01:41:04,001
Huh! And I won't go anywhere!!??

1347
01:41:04,070 --> 01:41:05,662
Who are you to tell
me anything??!!

1348
01:41:07,607 --> 01:41:09,131
Jai, what's wrong with you...

1349
01:41:09,209 --> 01:41:10,870
...We have...
we have happened to him...

1350
01:41:12,212 --> 01:41:13,406
We...

1351
01:41:14,080 --> 01:41:15,513
We have happened to him...

1352
01:41:16,216 --> 01:41:17,979
Jai... - It's no use saying
anything to me...

1353
01:41:18,618 --> 01:41:20,518
I have seen the truth
...you were right!!

1354
01:41:20,787 --> 01:41:23,119
I tried to ignore it
time and again...

1355
01:41:23,189 --> 01:41:24,486
But its true!!

1356
01:41:24,658 --> 01:41:26,148
Marriage is an outdated
institution!!

1357
01:41:26,459 --> 01:41:28,393
I was wrong!!
No... we were wrong Jai!

1358
01:41:28,495 --> 01:41:30,588
I think I need to use
a box his teeth in!

1359
01:41:30,830 --> 01:41:32,559
Stop right there!

1360
01:41:47,047 --> 01:41:50,983
...this is a very poisonous snake!!

1361
01:41:51,785 --> 01:41:53,412
You want to scare us with a snake!

1362
01:41:54,421 --> 01:41:55,479
Have you gone crazy?

1363
01:41:55,555 --> 01:41:56,852
You want to let down an
innocent girl huh??!!

1364
01:41:56,923 --> 01:41:58,515
God! What're you both doing??

1365
01:41:58,591 --> 01:41:59,751
And then you want me
to deal with her!

1366
01:41:59,826 --> 01:42:01,794
Goloo! Let go of each other!!

1367
01:42:05,465 --> 01:42:06,898
Goloo, what are you doing?!!

1368
01:42:08,068 --> 01:42:10,434
God! Why are men's brains
in their muscles!!

1369
01:42:14,774 --> 01:42:15,798
Sorry pal!!

1370
01:42:19,512 --> 01:42:20,536
Help me!

1371
01:42:20,947 --> 01:42:24,439
Jai!! Now I'll make darn
sure you get married...

1372
01:42:24,751 --> 01:42:26,651
I can't think of a
better revenge!!

1373
01:42:26,786 --> 01:42:27,775
I cant either!

1374
01:42:27,887 --> 01:42:28,979
Rahul bro!

1375
01:42:29,923 --> 01:42:30,947
Rahul!!

1376
01:42:33,827 --> 01:42:35,988
Aaaaaaaaaaaaa!!

1377
01:42:42,836 --> 01:42:44,463
Rahul!!

1378
01:42:44,738 --> 01:42:47,468
Jai, Rahul doesn't know to swim!!

1379
01:42:47,674 --> 01:42:48,902
Even I don't know to swim.

1380
01:44:02,882 --> 01:44:04,975
This is all your fault!!!

1381
01:44:05,819 --> 01:44:07,081
Now come on and get married!!

1382
01:44:13,493 --> 01:44:14,755
Sorry... Pooja

1383
01:44:18,531 --> 01:44:19,998
By the way... I don't
think I've ever...

1384
01:44:20,800 --> 01:44:22,233
...enjoyed A slap so much before!!

1385
01:44:26,005 --> 01:44:27,029
To Gondla!!

1386
01:44:36,583 --> 01:44:37,982
Please bring the bride... hurry!

1387
01:44:42,622 --> 01:44:44,021
Ok... everything is ready... lets go...

1388
01:44:46,893 --> 01:44:47,917
One minute...

1389
01:44:58,104 --> 01:45:00,595
Pooja!
- Hey Muskaan! What happened??

1390
01:45:02,642 --> 01:45:03,768
Veeru bhaiya!

1391
01:45:03,843 --> 01:45:05,834
Oh no o no... uff if only the
ceremony had finished...

1392
01:45:05,945 --> 01:45:07,606
...then he could do nothing to us!

1393
01:45:14,454 --> 01:45:15,512
Veeru Bro...

1394
01:45:15,922 --> 01:45:17,981
Yes baba! Yes we reached on time,

1395
01:45:18,258 --> 01:45:20,055
No, no the wedding has
not happened yet,

1396
01:45:20,126 --> 01:45:21,491
I know you'll be shamed!!

1397
01:45:21,561 --> 01:45:22,653
I'll call you.

1398
01:45:26,699 --> 01:45:29,429
Hey where are you going?
- Listen Veeru bhaiyya!

1399
01:45:31,437 --> 01:45:32,836
Hang on! Or he'll shoot you!

1400
01:45:33,473 --> 01:45:35,065
Why is every girl's
brother a goon??

1401
01:45:45,885 --> 01:45:47,216
Excuse me! This is hooliganism!

1402
01:45:47,453 --> 01:45:49,478
You don't know who I am!
I'll take you to court!

1403
01:45:58,231 --> 01:46:00,631
For your information, we're both
over 18 yrs old! Adults...

1404
01:46:00,700 --> 01:46:03,999
...we'll report you to the police!
- Jai?!! Shoot at the tyres!

1405
01:46:04,437 --> 01:46:05,495
How do I shoot??

1406
01:46:05,672 --> 01:46:07,162
With your gun you moron!!

1407
01:46:07,240 --> 01:46:08,730
Err... gun... the gun is... fake...

1408
01:46:11,177 --> 01:46:13,668
They'll escape... - Are you serious?

1409
01:46:14,881 --> 01:46:15,973
The gun is a fake??

1410
01:46:16,683 --> 01:46:17,945
The gun is a fake?

1411
01:46:18,718 --> 01:46:23,815
...with that gun... you made me
drive from Gaggal to Shimla...

1412
01:46:24,023 --> 01:46:26,491
Shimla to Manali... - Manali to god
knows where like a mad fool!

1413
01:46:26,659 --> 01:46:29,685
That gun WAS A FAKE??!!!
A FAKE YOU crook??!!!

1414
01:46:31,598 --> 01:46:34,761
Hey Poojajumped into a snake
infested pond for love...

1415
01:46:34,834 --> 01:46:37,064
...ALL I DID WAS keep a fake gun!

1416
01:46:37,804 --> 01:46:39,203
All is fair in love ok?

1417
01:46:39,439 --> 01:46:40,963
Goloo! Rahul bhaiya!

1418
01:46:41,674 --> 01:46:44,438
Muskaan!!
- That's Pooja Rahul Bhaiya!

1419
01:46:44,744 --> 01:46:47,212
...it was HER idea! - When she
saw Veeru bhaiya... she said...

1420
01:46:47,447 --> 01:46:48,709
...that this would be
the only way!

1421
01:46:48,781 --> 01:46:51,443
She'll pretend that SHE is the
one marrying Jai and not me!

1422
01:46:51,784 --> 01:46:53,911
When Veeru bhaiya would lift
the veil and see its...

1423
01:46:53,987 --> 01:46:56,080
...her! And then she would
say Who Muskaan??

1424
01:46:56,155 --> 01:46:58,817
I don't know any Muskaan!! Then
he'd go away and I'd come...

1425
01:46:58,891 --> 01:47:00,415
...and take my place at the alter.

1426
01:47:00,660 --> 01:47:03,060
Why didn't you tell this earlier??
- Where was the time??

1427
01:47:03,529 --> 01:47:05,622
The moment we walked out,
bhaiya grabbed Pooja!

1428
01:47:06,032 --> 01:47:07,465
It's not my fault...

1429
01:47:07,634 --> 01:47:08,965
Don't yell at me!

1430
01:47:14,040 --> 01:47:15,473
He has a gun!!

1431
01:47:15,708 --> 01:47:17,642
And I don't even have a GUN!!

1432
01:47:21,714 --> 01:47:26,742
He... Arre! Hey! Just a
minute! Just a minute!

1433
01:47:29,489 --> 01:47:30,581
I love you Muskaan!

1434
01:47:31,891 --> 01:47:33,552
Just a minute... one
minute one minute!

1435
01:47:34,560 --> 01:47:36,494
By the way... can I tell
you a secret??!!

1436
01:47:36,896 --> 01:47:39,729
Now what??? - The gun isn't a
gun! - The bride isn't Muskaan...

1437
01:47:39,799 --> 01:47:40,959
Now which great secret
is left to be told??

1438
01:47:41,034 --> 01:47:46,734
Ah! The secret is... that you
really truly love Pooja!

1439
01:47:48,074 --> 01:47:49,632
Ungag her...

1440
01:47:53,780 --> 01:47:56,442
Bhaiya! This isn't Muskaan didi!

1441
01:47:59,052 --> 01:48:00,781
Who are you?? - Who are YOU??

1442
01:48:00,853 --> 01:48:03,083
And why did you kidnap
me from my wedding???

1443
01:48:03,156 --> 01:48:05,556
Your wedding? To Jai??
- Who else??

1444
01:48:06,125 --> 01:48:10,459
So where's Muskaan?? - Who
Muskaan? I don't know any Muskaan?

1445
01:48:12,065 --> 01:48:13,760
Sorry... I thought 'Jai
was getting...

1446
01:48:13,833 --> 01:48:15,698
...married to my sister Muskaan...

1447
01:48:15,768 --> 01:48:18,464
If you were mistaken why does
it become my fault!!

1448
01:48:18,538 --> 01:48:19,732
Take me back at once!! You idiot!

1449
01:48:19,806 --> 01:48:21,706
Who are you calling an idiot
huh??!! One tight...

1450
01:48:32,018 --> 01:48:33,952
Rahul... they're turning back
towards the temple!!

1451
01:48:34,020 --> 01:48:36,614
Stooop! My fiance!!

1452
01:48:39,425 --> 01:48:41,416
C'mon... hurry...

1453
01:48:45,198 --> 01:48:47,462
How dare you kidnap my wife!!

1454
01:48:47,533 --> 01:48:48,795
Your wife??
Oh what is he blabbering??

1455
01:48:48,868 --> 01:48:51,928
No no no! He means my wife!

1456
01:48:52,472 --> 01:48:54,599
...your wife?
- I mean... my wife-to-be!

1457
01:48:55,575 --> 01:49:00,069
...yes!! How dare you kidnap
Jai's wife to be!!

1458
01:49:01,981 --> 01:49:03,676
You just said 'Your' wife...

1459
01:49:04,083 --> 01:49:05,846
Now you're saying 'Jai's-wife-to
be...

1460
01:49:06,018 --> 01:49:07,849
What the hell are you
talking about??

1461
01:49:07,920 --> 01:49:12,152
Yes!! What the hell is he talking
about!!?? - Veeru... sir...

1462
01:49:12,658 --> 01:49:15,218
Quiet... you're confusing
poor Veeru sir...

1463
01:49:15,461 --> 01:49:16,519
...Veeru sir...

1464
01:49:16,629 --> 01:49:19,621
...actually she 'Was' my wife... but
we're divorced...

1465
01:49:19,699 --> 01:49:22,190
...now... and NOW she is
Jai's-wife-to-be!

1466
01:49:22,435 --> 01:49:23,925
Get it? Simple!

1467
01:49:24,203 --> 01:49:25,864
So can we go now sir... it's
getting...

1468
01:49:25,938 --> 01:49:27,633
...late for the wedding you see...

1469
01:49:27,707 --> 01:49:28,935
Come on come on come on...

1470
01:49:33,679 --> 01:49:35,169
Boss... something's fishy...

1471
01:49:35,515 --> 01:49:37,380
Jai first said 'My' wife... not
'Wife to be'...

1472
01:49:37,450 --> 01:49:39,475
I think they're trying
to fool you...

1473
01:49:45,124 --> 01:49:47,684
If he tries to stop us... you run
off... and get married quickly...

1474
01:49:47,760 --> 01:49:49,625
...we'll try and hold these two off

1475
01:49:56,469 --> 01:49:57,663
Veeru sir is calling you!

1476
01:50:01,474 --> 01:50:02,998
Veeru sir! Veeru brother!

1477
01:50:06,546 --> 01:50:10,710
Now tell me huh??!!
Where's Muskaan? TELL ME!!

1478
01:50:11,851 --> 01:50:16,447
This will do! Come on come on
come on! - What are you doing?

1479
01:50:16,522 --> 01:50:17,546
First you stole my motorcycle!

1480
01:50:17,623 --> 01:50:18,885
Now you're taking my
wife's stole???

1481
01:50:18,958 --> 01:50:21,722
If she finds out she'll hang
me by the same cloth!!

1482
01:50:21,794 --> 01:50:23,523
Speak-up!! Where is Muskaan!!!???

1483
01:50:23,596 --> 01:50:24,620
How would I know?

1484
01:50:24,831 --> 01:50:29,768
Pooja do you know where this
nuskaan, sorry nuksaan is?

1485
01:50:29,836 --> 01:50:32,566
Who nuksaan?
- Abe! Not nuksaan! MUSKAAN!!

1486
01:50:32,839 --> 01:50:34,739
See??!!
If we don't even a person's name

1487
01:50:34,841 --> 01:50:36,741
How would we know that
person's whereabouts??

1488
01:50:38,744 --> 01:50:40,837
Yes dad... uff! I know you'll
be shamed before everyone...

1489
01:50:41,948 --> 01:50:43,779
I just told you a minute
ago we haven't...

1490
01:50:43,850 --> 01:50:46,512
...found her... l'm not a fool dad!
- I'll call you later!

1491
01:50:48,454 --> 01:50:52,117
The same taunt since childhood...
fool fool fool!

1492
01:50:52,792 --> 01:50:56,819
Fool! ...since childhood? That's
very sad...

1493
01:50:57,096 --> 01:50:58,757
Is he a father or a monster??

1494
01:51:00,867 --> 01:51:02,994
Boss... he's trying to fool you!

1495
01:51:06,105 --> 01:51:07,595
Call the father...

1496
01:51:07,673 --> 01:51:09,402
He is needed for the ritual...

1497
01:51:09,575 --> 01:51:12,942
...father why don't you become
the father?? - What?? How?

1498
01:51:13,012 --> 01:51:15,810
What do you mean how? This
is how!

1499
01:51:25,224 --> 01:51:27,784
Done done... get off! Done!

1500
01:51:36,135 --> 01:51:38,660
Who will do 'Lajja human'... call
the brides brother...

1501
01:51:38,738 --> 01:51:41,172
Do you want to get me killed??
- Why? Is there no brother?

1502
01:51:41,407 --> 01:51:42,669
There is but I told you
there's no time!!

1503
01:51:42,742 --> 01:51:43,504
- You become the brother

1504
01:51:43,576 --> 01:51:45,601
Are you crazy??? I just
became her father!!

1505
01:51:45,678 --> 01:51:46,645
How can I become the brother now??

1506
01:51:46,712 --> 01:51:48,509
Oh! Alright fine... bijli baba... you
become the brother please...

1507
01:51:48,581 --> 01:51:50,845
Ok fine now we have a brother... now
get on with this

1508
01:51:51,884 --> 01:51:53,408
'Sakha-saptapadha-bbhava'

1509
01:51:57,556 --> 01:51:58,648
Now pass it to her...

1510
01:52:02,061 --> 01:52:03,119
Now pass it to him...

1511
01:52:07,199 --> 01:52:09,861
Now put it in the fire... - Come
on!! If we had to put it here...

1512
01:52:09,936 --> 01:52:11,028
...why didn't you just
give it to ME!

1513
01:52:11,103 --> 01:52:13,003
...why are going round
and wasting time!!!

1514
01:52:13,072 --> 01:52:15,905
I told you there is no time!
- There is a ritual involved, sir.

1515
01:52:16,175 --> 01:52:17,802
I'm not one of those
fake priests!

1516
01:52:18,077 --> 01:52:19,669
...you go get someone else!

1517
01:52:19,745 --> 01:52:21,906
Ok ok... you CAN speak quickly
though cant you?

1518
01:52:23,416 --> 01:52:25,611
I can try... - Show me... quickly...

1519
01:52:25,785 --> 01:52:27,548
'SAKHA SAPTAPADHA BBHAVA'

1520
01:52:27,620 --> 01:52:28,917
Quickly I said quickly!!

1523
01:52:40,366 --> 01:52:42,163
'SAKHA SAPTAPADHA BBHAVA
SAKHA-SAPTAPADHA-BBHAVA'

1524
01:53:28,781 --> 01:53:30,908
Boss!
The guy has punctured you!!

1525
01:53:37,823 --> 01:53:38,983
Pooja! Pooja!

1526
01:53:59,145 --> 01:54:00,476
Rahul! Hurry!

1527
01:54:27,640 --> 01:54:28,766
The weddings over...

1528
01:54:29,041 --> 01:54:30,633
You two are husband and wife now

1529
01:54:35,648 --> 01:54:37,206
Give us your blessings, sir.

1530
01:54:37,750 --> 01:54:39,479
God bless, dear. Be happy!

1531
01:54:42,054 --> 01:54:43,078
Done? - Yes!

1532
01:55:05,744 --> 01:55:07,644
Bhaiya... give us your blessings...

1533
01:55:08,013 --> 01:55:10,038
I am MRS DHUMAL now...

1534
01:55:18,924 --> 01:55:21,484
Yes baba... if I find her I'll
be able to stop her right??

1535
01:55:22,628 --> 01:55:25,222
I am not a fool!
I was mistaken!!

1536
01:55:27,032 --> 01:55:29,865
In the daytime? Pooja?

1537
01:55:30,636 --> 01:55:32,695
Death doesn't come according to...

1538
01:55:32,872 --> 01:55:35,432
...a time table does it?? Rahul?

1539
01:55:37,042 --> 01:55:39,408
...what are you doing Pooja...
you're spilling it all over!!

1540
01:55:40,679 --> 01:55:42,806
You're so fussy Rahul!!

1541
01:55:43,616 --> 01:55:44,742
They're at it again!!

1542
01:55:46,886 --> 01:55:49,616
...Rahul... I am beginning
to talk like you...

1543
01:55:51,524 --> 01:55:52,616
And I like you...

1544
01:55:52,858 --> 01:55:53,916
Yuuuuck!

1545
01:56:02,134 --> 01:56:04,466
Hey!
I have an idea... let's all go...

1546
01:56:04,537 --> 01:56:06,562
...on a honeymoon together... again!

1547
01:56:08,974 --> 01:56:11,704
Are you crazy?? There's just one
van... where will we sleep??

1548
01:56:11,977 --> 01:56:14,707
We can't do this! - Says who? Did
we have a discussion??

1549
01:56:15,681 --> 01:56:17,205
We will sleep in sleeping
bags outside...

1550
01:56:17,449 --> 01:56:18,746
They will sleep in
the van inside...

1551
01:56:18,817 --> 01:56:21,547
We will travel together and
