All Tamils get out!

Leave me! Leave us! No! lwon't go!

00:06:42,702 --> 00:06:44,375
'Breaking news.'

6
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:46,917
'Sri Lankan president
has been assassinated.'

7
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,447
'The killing was carried
out using a human bomb.'

8
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:53,316
'According to the local
police this incident took place..'

9
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:57,088
'..when he was coming out
of Colombo's Army Headquarters.'

10
00:06:57,483 --> 00:07:00,862
'It is being alleged that
the LTF could be behind this.'

11
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:07,267
'After this incident it is possible that
peace attempts will get deferred.'

12
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,964
'And the situation there
could get tense again.'

Ruby.

14
00:08:12,124 --> 00:08:13,865
I want to say everything.

15
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:17,603
The truth"

16
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,908
I cannot carry..

17
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,339
"This burden anymore.

18
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:28,780
You've been drinking again.

19
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:30,210
I've told you.

20
00:08:30,443 --> 00:08:33,549
Whatever is bothering you,
share it

21
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:35,356
You will feel lighter.

22
00:08:35,882 --> 00:08:37,953
Otherwise, go home.

BetrayaL.

24
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:42,088
Power..

25
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:44,090
Greed..

26
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:50,406
Can I talk about such
things before your God?

27
00:08:50,897 --> 00:08:52,035
Yes, You can.

28
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:54,371
The last witness.

29
00:08:56,435 --> 00:08:58,415
They killed him as well.

30
00:09:00,606 --> 00:09:01,914
It was a game.

31
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:04,847
A conspiracy.

32
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:07,750
Who are you?

33
00:09:08,614 --> 00:09:10,685
It's been three years since
you've been coming here...

34
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:14,363
And What's this conspiracy
that you are talking of?

35
00:09:15,254 --> 00:09:17,461
What wrong did our
Prime Minister do?

36
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:21,572
Why did we let him die?

37
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:22,929
What?

38
00:09:24,196 --> 00:09:26,608
We could've saved
our prime minister.

39
00:09:27,934 --> 00:09:29,436
What do you know?

40
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,145
'I was there, Father.'

41
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:40,854
'It was the darkest phase
in the history of Sri Lanka.'

42
00:09:45,217 --> 00:09:47,891
'The clashes between the
largest ethic group Sinhalese.'

43
00:09:48,688 --> 00:09:52,033
'..and the minority Tamils..

44
00:09:52,858 --> 00:09:55,031
...had was going through
its worst crisis.'

45
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:59,576
'This ethic violence claimed thousands
of Tamilian civilian lives...'

46
00:10:04,203 --> 00:10:05,876
Abuses..

47
00:10:11,477 --> 00:10:14,890
'The supply of basic
necessities like food..'

48
00:10:15,881 --> 00:10:16,882
'Water..'

49
00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:18,389
'Everything was stopped.'

50
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:22,831
'A lot of families were destroyed.'

51
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:34,077
'And thus thousands of Tamilian
youth turned rebellious.'

52
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:37,309
'And joined the LTF leader Anna.'

53
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:38,678
Long Live Eelam

54
00:10:38,771 --> 00:10:40,011
Long Live Eelam

55
00:10:46,412 --> 00:10:50,121
'Anna refused to surrender
before the Sri Lankan forces.'

56
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:54,056
'And raised the demand
for a separate Tamil state.'

57
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:58,534
'And thus began,
the endless killings.'

58
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:07,204
'These bloodbath made
many Tamils lose their homes.'

59
00:11:08,734 --> 00:11:10,839
'And they sought refuge in India.'

60
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:17,021
'Indian government
expressed its concern..

61
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:19,483
...and decided to intervene.'

62
00:11:23,883 --> 00:11:26,420
Peace Accord is an important
political decision.

63
00:11:26,752 --> 00:11:28,163
I will be going ahead with it.

64
00:11:28,554 --> 00:11:30,864
We will be signing
the Peace Accord tomorrow.

65
00:11:31,323 --> 00:11:33,963
To make sure that no inhumane
activity takes place..

66
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:36,332
...during the Provincial
Council Elections.

67
00:11:36,662 --> 00:11:40,439
...l've decided to send
a peace force to the island.

68
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:43,278
'Prime Minister signed
the historical Peace Accord..

69
00:11:43,335 --> 00:11:45,008
...with the Sri Lankan
President today.'

70
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:47,483
'He also declared the
Provincial Council Elections.'

71
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,343
'So that once again there is
peace and normalcy in the island.'

72
00:11:50,609 --> 00:11:52,850
'The first group
of the peace force.. '

73
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:56,723
'..reached there with an intention
of making the rebels surrender arms.'

74
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:01,921
'In the hope that peace
and normalcy returns.'

75
00:12:02,788 --> 00:12:06,497
'But Anna rejected
the Peace Accord.'

76
00:12:08,961 --> 00:12:12,306
'19 LTF cadres committed
suicide in Sri Lankan custody.'

77
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,671
'And Anna blamed lndia..

78
00:12:16,268 --> 00:12:17,645
...and Sri Lanka for it.'

79
00:12:18,437 --> 00:12:22,408
'He said that this peace accord
is not in the favor of the Tamils.'

80
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:26,989
'He feared that if
they surrendered arms..'

81
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,988
'..then once the
peace force leaves..'

82
00:12:30,816 --> 00:12:33,296
'..all the Tamils in
the island will be killed.'

83
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,957
'Hence..
'He was not ready to negotiate.'

84
00:12:37,022 --> 00:12:38,626
This is going to be a long war.

85
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:44,237
'Indian Army launched
an operation to capture Anna.'

86
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,886
'But our soldiers got killed .'

87
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:06,854
'since Anna was
already in the know of..

88
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:10,066
...our operational
details and intels'

89
00:13:13,692 --> 00:13:17,697
'And from here on,
began a gruesome guerilla war..'

90
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:20,032
'..between Anna
and the peace force.'

91
00:13:48,093 --> 00:13:49,970
Our soldiers are getting killed.

92
00:13:50,229 --> 00:13:51,936
Operation details
are getting leaked.

93
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:55,001
RD, I hope you are aware
of what your boys are up to.

94
00:13:55,067 --> 00:13:58,310
But we had warned you,
not to send the forces.

95
00:13:58,771 --> 00:14:00,978
But it was your General
who assured the PM..

96
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,586
...that we'll disarm
them in 72 hours.

97
00:14:04,276 --> 00:14:06,347
And here we are, after one year.

98
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:09,853
If this continues,
we're sure to get embarrassed.

99
00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:11,660
PM needs is answerable
to the people.

100
00:14:11,717 --> 00:14:15,665
Mr. Cabinet Secretary, we are not
fighting with a traditional army.

101
00:14:16,288 --> 00:14:19,667
This is a locally
entrenched guerilla force.

102
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:22,769
We just can't make out who's
a militant and who's a civilian!

103
00:14:22,962 --> 00:14:24,942
We don't even have proper maps!

104
00:14:25,064 --> 00:14:29,809
But yes, if they attack us,
we will retaliate.

105
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:32,281
This shouldn't become
another Vietnam for us.

106
00:14:32,771 --> 00:14:34,478
How much more can
we embarrass the PM?

107
00:14:35,074 --> 00:14:35,745
RD?

108
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:36,980
The fact is,

109
00:14:37,943 --> 00:14:39,479
Anna doesn't trust us anymore.

110
00:14:39,745 --> 00:14:42,692
And Perhaps we ourselves are
responsible for creating this situation

111
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:44,761
If we loosen the grip any further"

112
00:14:45,117 --> 00:14:49,224
...it will be a golden opportunity for
the west to get inside the island.

113
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:51,130
And this is already happening

114
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:53,531
Guruji all of a sudden
going to Singapore..

115
00:14:53,592 --> 00:14:55,799
...with Murthy for
a spiritual tour..

116
00:14:56,128 --> 00:14:57,368
Is it a coincidence?

117
00:14:57,429 --> 00:14:58,840
So, Mr. Murthy,

118
00:14:59,298 --> 00:15:02,040
...you wish to be the
lord of the largest democracy?

119
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:04,079
I've always been saying..

120
00:15:04,136 --> 00:15:06,878
...that there's a conspiracy
to overthrow the government.

121
00:15:07,306 --> 00:15:08,649
One thing is clear now.

122
00:15:08,874 --> 00:15:11,354
Only military action won't suffice.

123
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:13,456
All these are clear cut signs.

124
00:15:13,712 --> 00:15:15,555
Overt operations
won't be enough now.

125
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:17,959
RD, get all the covert ops ready.

126
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:21,827
This Peace Accord needs to succeed,
at any cost.

127
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:23,631
That's all. Good luck.

128
00:15:27,293 --> 00:15:28,271
RD..

129
00:15:28,327 --> 00:15:28,998
Stay.

130
00:15:29,061 --> 00:15:31,769
Enough of these discussions.

131
00:15:32,197 --> 00:15:34,108
Media is asking a lot of questions.

132
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:36,279
You'll have to intervene.

133
00:15:36,402 --> 00:15:37,745
I'm ready..

134
00:15:38,003 --> 00:15:40,347
...to use all the
intelligence at my disposal.

135
00:15:40,406 --> 00:15:42,181
But who are we really fighting?

136
00:15:42,908 --> 00:15:43,943
You, too, need to understand.

137
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:46,216
The situation is very sensitive.

138
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:51,117
Anna won't surrender arms.

139
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:53,119
He is adamant.

140
00:15:53,218 --> 00:15:56,392
And others are waiting
to jump in to win his trust.

141
00:15:56,588 --> 00:15:58,363
We will lose the island.

142
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,871
And that will be a serious
national threat for us.

143
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:04,773
Now is not the time
to go by the book.

144
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:07,070
The time to question"

145
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:09,540
...what is legitimate
and what is not, is over.

146
00:16:09,702 --> 00:16:13,479
You know very well what
needs to be done with Anna.

147
00:16:13,939 --> 00:16:15,350
Send in your best men.

148
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:19,121
We need to form a Provincial
Council there, before Diwali.

149
00:16:21,747 --> 00:16:23,954
Swarup, get me Major Vikram.

150
00:16:24,049 --> 00:16:26,928
Iwant him in Delhi
in the next 24 hours.

151
00:16:27,186 --> 00:16:28,187
Urgent.

152
00:16:38,697 --> 00:16:39,869
Ruby, I need to go.

153
00:16:39,932 --> 00:16:41,411
Otherwise, you know.. - Look,

154
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:43,705
I know, I am an army wife.

155
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:47,214
And I need to hold
my head high and all that.

156
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,009
And lwill.

157
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,121
But it's been four years.

158
00:16:53,045 --> 00:16:54,547
And ljust keep missing you.

159
00:16:56,715 --> 00:16:57,989
How do I stay normal?

160
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,421
Don't worry.

161
00:17:02,488 --> 00:17:04,229
Everything will be normal soon.

162
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:07,231
Oh yes, and avoid all these news.

163
00:17:07,626 --> 00:17:09,071
And take care of yourself.

164
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:11,936
If you are so concerned
about me then don't go.

165
00:17:17,136 --> 00:17:18,615
Six months, at least.

166
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:21,149
Till I hold you again, like this.

167
00:17:59,211 --> 00:18:00,087
So, what's happening?

168
00:18:00,145 --> 00:18:01,681
Bala has been informed.

169
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:05,057
Jaffna safe house
has been activated.

170
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:06,285
Vikram..

171
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:08,564
Still as restless as ever?

172
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:10,161
Old habits die hard, sir.

173
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:10,926
Relax.

174
00:18:11,023 --> 00:18:12,024
Swaru p.

175
00:18:12,624 --> 00:18:13,534
Additional director.

176
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:14,933
Of course, I remember, sir.

177
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:17,232
I had met you briefly
during the Mizoram operation.

178
00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:18,737
Good memory.

179
00:18:18,897 --> 00:18:19,568
Sir.

180
00:18:19,631 --> 00:18:20,871
Anyway, talking about work..

181
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:23,413
Do you know anything
about lndo-Lankan situation?

182
00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:25,072
I've done my homework, sir.

183
00:18:25,737 --> 00:18:27,080
You know nothing.

184
00:18:27,139 --> 00:18:31,349
You'll be solely responsible for all
covert operations of RAW in Jaffna.

185
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:32,011
Sir.

186
00:18:32,077 --> 00:18:34,318
PM is concerned about
the situation there.

187
00:18:34,379 --> 00:18:38,850
His clear agenda is to execute
Provincial Elections successfully

188
00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:41,895
The Small militant groups
there have surrendered.

189
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:46,334
But The most powerful group,
the most ferocious one, LTF..

190
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:47,998
Is still resistant.

191
00:18:48,093 --> 00:18:49,572
Do we have a strategy, sir?

192
00:18:49,728 --> 00:18:52,504
Step one: Break LTF.

193
00:18:52,564 --> 00:18:55,010
The most likely candidate
for that: Mallaya.

194
00:18:55,167 --> 00:18:56,805
He's Anna's Man Friday.

195
00:18:56,902 --> 00:18:58,176
Very loyal.

196
00:18:58,403 --> 00:18:59,814
Impossible to reach.

197
00:19:00,005 --> 00:19:01,712
Step Two: Shri.

198
00:19:01,907 --> 00:19:05,912
He's the only man in the
island who can stand against Anna.

199
00:19:06,211 --> 00:19:08,088
Get him on our side.

200
00:19:08,213 --> 00:19:12,286
For official matters you'll report
to the Madras Desk Head, Bala.

201
00:19:12,618 --> 00:19:15,531
He's tough but knows
a lot about Jaffna.

202
00:19:15,754 --> 00:19:20,225
But you'll report to me personally,
about everything.

203
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:22,636
Keep me in the loop. -Yes, sir.

204
00:19:22,728 --> 00:19:24,435
Any questions? - No, sir.

205
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:26,134
Welcome aboard.

206
00:19:26,298 --> 00:19:27,368
Come, Swaroop.

207
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,178
Jaffna?

208
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:41,521
But isn't a civil
war going on there, Vi?

209
00:19:41,713 --> 00:19:42,783
Don't worry.

210
00:19:42,981 --> 00:19:45,120
I'm leaving behind
a contact - Swarup's.

211
00:19:45,284 --> 00:19:46,991
Call him in case of any emergency.

212
00:19:49,988 --> 00:19:53,265
'Indian Prime Minister
today has categorically.

213
00:19:53,325 --> 00:19:56,169
...stated that the peace forces..'

214
00:19:56,261 --> 00:19:59,936
'..will not be withdrawn until the
elections are successfully held.'

215
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:03,280
'And that India won't
allow any foreign powers..

216
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:06,509
...to interfere in
her regional matters.'

217
00:20:28,427 --> 00:20:29,428
Hi.

218
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:31,364
Vikram.

219
00:20:31,797 --> 00:20:32,935
J aya.

220
00:20:33,298 --> 00:20:34,504
Pleasure meeting you.

221
00:20:37,202 --> 00:20:38,545
Is this Your normal route?

222
00:20:38,604 --> 00:20:40,584
I'm writing a piece
on the refugees.

223
00:20:41,506 --> 00:20:42,246
You?

224
00:20:42,341 --> 00:20:43,547
Chibber route.

225
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:46,548
Do you still operate out of London?

226
00:20:46,778 --> 00:20:49,349
No, here for some time now.

227
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:51,557
I've read your articles.

228
00:20:52,517 --> 00:20:53,962
You are quite critical.

229
00:20:54,286 --> 00:20:56,232
Criticizing our national policies..

230
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:58,560
"Doesn't make me anti national.

231
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:00,696
Not at all.

232
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:02,803
It's the birth right
of all you journalists.

233
00:21:03,328 --> 00:21:06,400
Whatever you print,
it becomes a bestseller.

234
00:21:07,065 --> 00:21:08,567
You think you're more patriotic?

235
00:21:08,667 --> 00:21:09,668
Of course.

236
00:21:30,422 --> 00:21:32,766
Those with passports,
proceed to the passport division.

237
00:21:33,525 --> 00:21:35,436
Those without passport,
please register at the army camp.

238
00:21:36,094 --> 00:21:37,402
'Men, stay at the back.'

239
00:21:37,496 --> 00:21:39,942
'No matter between
whom the conflict is..'

240
00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:42,376
'No matter what the reason is..'

241
00:21:43,068 --> 00:21:46,447
'The first casualties are
always the Innocent civilians.'

242
00:21:47,706 --> 00:21:49,913
'And This was happening
in Sri Lanka as well.'

243
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:53,688
'There was devastation everywhere.'

244
00:22:02,254 --> 00:22:05,326
I've an authorized visa.
- Sorry, ma'am.

245
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:07,199
I'm allowed to pass through.
- I'm sorry.

246
00:22:07,693 --> 00:22:10,401
What are you saying? I'm here.
I'm ajournalist. - Sorry, ma'am.

247
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:12,664
What do you mean?
I have to get through.

248
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:15,478
Welcome to the land of Buddha, sir.

249
00:22:15,801 --> 00:22:17,075
KT. Kamal Tyagi.

250
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,509
Jaffna safe house is 118kms away.

251
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:28,180
Passport? ID?

252
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:49,873
'How could humanity ever
survive in all of this?'

253
00:22:50,335 --> 00:22:51,780
'In this small island..'

254
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:54,206
'Civilization was dying.'

255
00:23:19,965 --> 00:23:20,966
This way sir.

256
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:25,176
This is our safe house.

257
00:23:25,871 --> 00:23:27,578
Inform the high commission. - Yes.

258
00:23:27,773 --> 00:23:29,343
Myself Sushil Pandey. SP.

259
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:30,409
Hi, SP.

260
00:23:30,609 --> 00:23:31,781
Intercepts? - Yes, sir.

261
00:23:31,943 --> 00:23:34,981
Call records for the
past two days and intercepts.

262
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:40,552
Sir. - Hello, boys.

263
00:23:40,719 --> 00:23:42,392
Sir! - Sir,
Major Vikram reporting.

264
00:23:42,687 --> 00:23:44,166
I've heard about you.

265
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:45,991
Try this.

266
00:23:46,191 --> 00:23:47,966
A local drink. - Sir.

267
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,361
LTF.

268
00:23:49,828 --> 00:23:51,967
Most dedicated and disciplined.

269
00:23:52,531 --> 00:23:57,071
They operate from deep
within thejungle, from bunkers..

270
00:23:57,302 --> 00:23:58,440
...4O feet underground.

271
00:23:58,837 --> 00:24:00,111
Hence, this map.

272
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:02,113
Memorize it.

273
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:03,275
Relax.

274
00:24:03,575 --> 00:24:07,387
We'll be running our
phase two covert operations.

275
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:09,718
We need to weaken
LTF's top leaders.

276
00:24:09,848 --> 00:24:11,259
Dead or alive.

277
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:15,757
LFT. Liberations of Tamils Front,
also known as Tigers.

278
00:24:15,921 --> 00:24:18,697
The top leader: Pandyan,
Intel chief.

279
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:22,167
Mallaya,
deputy leader and army commander.

280
00:24:22,394 --> 00:24:24,874
Rajsekharan,
their spokesperson, an arms dealer.

281
00:24:25,063 --> 00:24:28,203
But our hero, Anna Baskaran.

282
00:24:28,567 --> 00:24:29,978
He doesn't need an intro.

283
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:32,282
On the other hand, TPA.

284
00:24:32,404 --> 00:24:33,474
Chief, Shri.

285
00:24:33,538 --> 00:24:35,882
Once upon atime
he was Anna's partner.

286
00:24:36,007 --> 00:24:38,385
He's soft.
Wants to get into politics.

287
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:41,117
Prime Minister wants that
Anna should surrender arms..

288
00:24:41,179 --> 00:24:43,682
...and join the
elections before Diwali.

289
00:24:44,683 --> 00:24:46,492
Make Shri powerful.

290
00:24:46,952 --> 00:24:48,363
Make them fight each other.

291
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,028
Do we this all by ourselves?

292
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:51,323
Obviously.

293
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:53,164
You are not in the army anymore.

294
00:24:53,225 --> 00:24:54,033
You are an agent of R&AW.

295
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:57,572
Hence use less brawn
and more brains.

296
00:24:57,929 --> 00:24:59,408
You'll report everything to me.

297
00:24:59,564 --> 00:25:03,102
I'll find out what I
need to through my own means.

298
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:05,239
I cannot afford mistakes.

299
00:25:05,804 --> 00:25:06,805
Sir.

300
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:11,085
And most importantly,
you are a team leader.

301
00:25:11,476 --> 00:25:13,786
So don't get caught.
Never get caught.

302
00:25:22,654 --> 00:25:25,225
'My primary task
for the next few days..'

303
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:26,064
Turn left.

304
00:25:26,124 --> 00:25:27,398
'..Was to find Shree.'

305
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:31,474
We identified a
few important links.

306
00:25:32,163 --> 00:25:36,578
'We got a breakthrough when
Narayanan agreed to meet us.'

307
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:38,870
Hello, sir.

308
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:40,347
I got through Narayanan.

309
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:41,882
He's agreed to meet.

310
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,275
Tomorrow, 7:00am.

311
00:25:43,441 --> 00:25:45,114
7kms from safe house.

312
00:25:50,682 --> 00:25:52,753
Sir, the one in white shirt.

313
00:25:53,485 --> 00:25:54,930
This basket. - How much
does it weigh? - 3O kgs.

314
00:25:54,986 --> 00:25:56,556
And This is for? - Local market.

315
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:03,970
70% of the earth
is covered with water.

316
00:26:04,496 --> 00:26:06,635
It's not so difficult
to catch fish.

317
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:08,100
Oh really?

318
00:26:08,466 --> 00:26:12,141
That really depends on the fish.

319
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:15,713
The deeper you go the
better fish you catch.

320
00:26:15,774 --> 00:26:16,912
Tell me, which one do you want?

321
00:26:16,975 --> 00:26:19,182
My bosses love the
fish you catch for them.

322
00:26:19,277 --> 00:26:20,984
Which one do you want?

323
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:24,458
I told you this one belongs
to the local market.

324
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:29,122
Tell me which one do you want?
CIA, KGB, Tigers.

325
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:30,756
They're All the same for me.

326
00:26:30,989 --> 00:26:32,491
I don't have time to waste.

327
00:26:32,624 --> 00:26:33,898
Don't even try to negotiate.

328
00:26:33,992 --> 00:26:34,993
Shri

329
00:26:37,162 --> 00:26:38,163
You an agent?

330
00:26:38,463 --> 00:26:39,965
Everyone is the same in a war zone.

331
00:26:40,198 --> 00:26:41,199
Maybe.

332
00:26:42,334 --> 00:26:45,315
But for me,
no satisfaction means no fish.

333
00:26:48,306 --> 00:26:51,446
You see this Information
business has become too risky&

334
00:26:52,377 --> 00:26:55,517
I'll have to give information
about you if anyone enquires.

335
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:58,154
I need to store that.

336
00:27:00,318 --> 00:27:01,456
Now you may Leave.

337
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:12,464
SfOP

338
00:27:16,034 --> 00:27:17,035
Go.

339
00:27:21,439 --> 00:27:23,749
How will you and your
government support me?

340
00:27:24,709 --> 00:27:25,881
The situation out here..

341
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:29,481
How will people sitting
in New Delhi control it?

342
00:27:29,614 --> 00:27:32,117
New Delhi recognizes your TPA.

343
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:34,689
And our PM's agenda
is exactly to settle that.

344
00:27:34,753 --> 00:27:36,494
Election and peace.

345
00:27:36,888 --> 00:27:37,958
Peace?

346
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:40,863
Anna has made me his archrival.

347
00:27:40,925 --> 00:27:42,871
We were like brothers.

348
00:27:43,428 --> 00:27:45,135
He's being brutal to our people.

349
00:27:45,196 --> 00:27:47,267
He wants total control over Jaffna.

350
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:48,935
People want to see one leader.

351
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,274
Come to the point.

352
00:27:51,736 --> 00:27:52,771
Sir,

353
00:27:53,738 --> 00:27:56,309
we want you to counter LTF.

354
00:28:00,645 --> 00:28:03,626
We need loads of
arms to counter Anna.

355
00:28:04,382 --> 00:28:06,157
Loads of them.

356
00:28:08,953 --> 00:28:11,900
Can your bosses
provide me with arms?

357
00:28:12,223 --> 00:28:13,361
Will they promise?

358
00:28:14,125 --> 00:28:15,126
Can you?

359
00:28:19,264 --> 00:28:21,266
Sir, we'll support you in this war.

360
00:28:21,633 --> 00:28:22,941
We're with you.

361
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,111
Wait, Mr. Vikram.

362
00:28:29,641 --> 00:28:31,882
I hate liars.

363
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:34,084
You won't get a second chance.

364
00:28:34,145 --> 00:28:35,453
Remember that.

365
00:28:37,282 --> 00:28:38,761
You need to relax, boss.

366
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:40,691
Shri neither trusts me, nor you.

367
00:28:40,752 --> 00:28:42,197
I'm just waiting
for the right time.

368
00:28:42,287 --> 00:28:45,598
He won't agree on anything
until he gets the arms.

369
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:46,760
Please understand, boss.

370
00:28:46,858 --> 00:28:48,394
Who are you working for?

371
00:28:48,493 --> 00:28:49,665
For Shri? Or for me?

372
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:52,004
Sir, I'll handle this my way.
Trust me.

373
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,231
Please, sir.

374
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:55,971
Keep me informed.

375
00:29:06,811 --> 00:29:07,846
Down.. down..

376
00:29:20,625 --> 00:29:22,263
Welcome, madam. This way.

377
00:30:26,891 --> 00:30:27,995
So,

378
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:30,903
you did meet with
the Prime Minister.

379
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:33,506
He offered you the support
what you were seeking.

380
00:30:33,698 --> 00:30:35,041
But then you backed off.

381
00:30:35,133 --> 00:30:37,306
My soldiers surrendered their arms.

382
00:30:37,702 --> 00:30:38,840
They were killed.

383
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:40,413
I was backstabbed.

384
00:30:40,905 --> 00:30:42,816
I want safety for my people.

385
00:30:43,041 --> 00:30:45,043
What happens when
the peace forces leave?

386
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:47,721
Look, it's a clear order
for the peace forces..

387
00:30:47,779 --> 00:30:49,850
...to ensure that the
elections go peacefully.

388
00:30:50,248 --> 00:30:52,660
But you're also hell bent
on boycotting these elections.

389
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:54,320
By teaming up with Shri?

390
00:30:54,619 --> 00:30:55,723
Double standard.

391
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,727
I'm already an elected leader.

392
00:30:58,189 --> 00:30:59,827
I've a legitimate army.

393
00:30:59,924 --> 00:31:00,959
Attention!

394
00:31:01,059 --> 00:31:03,130
So this bloodbath,
there's no end to it?

395
00:31:04,329 --> 00:31:05,364
I did not start it.

396
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:06,865
Salute!

397
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:09,769
Then if you don't agree
for a political solution"

398
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:11,711
...you'll have to
find a new partner.

399
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:15,343
Is there a new alliance?

400
00:31:17,108 --> 00:31:18,553
This is my land.

401
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,815
ELAM is my final destination.

402
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:25,559
For that if I need to
seek help from the west"

403
00:31:26,317 --> 00:31:27,591
"then I will.

404
00:31:28,353 --> 00:31:32,392
LTF's leader Anna
has once again rejected"

405
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:34,800
...lndia's offer
for peace elections.

406
00:31:34,993 --> 00:31:37,564
And has further stated that.

407
00:31:37,695 --> 00:31:40,733
...he will not hesitate
to seek help from the west.

408
00:31:41,299 --> 00:31:44,405
How does New Delhi react to this?

409
00:31:44,669 --> 00:31:47,843
How will this affect the
peace process in the island?

410
00:31:48,006 --> 00:31:50,179
Only time will tell.

411
00:31:57,382 --> 00:31:58,622
Rajsekharan,

412
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:01,960
you source funds
and arms from outside.

413
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:04,893
Go and meet our new foreign friend.

414
00:32:13,798 --> 00:32:14,902
We need..

415
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:18,141
...your help in ourfight,

416
00:32:18,569 --> 00:32:19,809
in our war.

417
00:32:20,171 --> 00:32:21,946
So you need our support?

418
00:32:23,908 --> 00:32:27,321
We need to be assured
of your support in the future.

419
00:32:29,914 --> 00:32:30,824
I have to pass through.

420
00:32:30,915 --> 00:32:32,826
There could be An ambush ma'am.
Rounds are being fired inside.

421
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:34,123
I can't allow you to go in.

422
00:32:34,185 --> 00:32:35,960
Look, I've the
colonel's permission.

423
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,758
I've received no such orders.
- Ma'am..

424
00:32:37,822 --> 00:32:41,429
I have to pass through.
- Captain. I know her.

425
00:32:43,361 --> 00:32:45,363
Not bad. Thank you.

426
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:47,443
I read your interview.

427
00:32:48,566 --> 00:32:49,636
How's Anna?

428
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:52,372
Hey, listen, he's not my friend.

429
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:54,249
But I will say this.

430
00:32:54,405 --> 00:32:57,648
I've never met anyone with
so much clarity and purpose.

431
00:32:58,009 --> 00:32:59,147
You can't buy him.

432
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:03,152
Then Anna must've also
told you about his new partner.

433
00:33:03,781 --> 00:33:05,124
You're asking me?

434
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:08,058
Until last year LTF
was favored by New Delhi.

435
00:33:08,219 --> 00:33:11,689
But now, their rival TPA Shri
seems to have taken their place.

436
00:33:11,756 --> 00:33:13,099
I don't know what
you're talking about.

437
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:15,137
Somebody has got
to be helping them.

438
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,532
Why tell me?

439
00:33:16,694 --> 00:33:18,002
It's yourjob, isn't it?

440
00:33:24,769 --> 00:33:28,808
"The date for arms deal
was decided as 6th July.

441
00:33:29,474 --> 00:33:33,445
'It was important that the
arms consignment reached Shri.'

442
00:33:36,381 --> 00:33:38,190
Hello. Capt. Murli.

443
00:33:38,716 --> 00:33:40,127
Delivery will be
made from Singapore.

444
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:41,026
From here.

445
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:43,759
By using fishing boats,
we'll make the exchange.

446
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:46,024
And this here,
is the dropping point.

447
00:33:46,124 --> 00:33:47,228
Point Pedro.

448
00:33:47,425 --> 00:33:49,496
Delivery at 4:00pm.
- 'But I didn't know that.'

449
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:53,303
'This small arms deal will
change both the local politics.'

450
00:33:53,464 --> 00:33:56,604
'..and my life forever.'

451
00:34:00,405 --> 00:34:02,681
Gifts are on the
way from Singapore.

452
00:34:03,975 --> 00:34:05,716
Be sure they reach our new friends.

453
00:34:05,777 --> 00:34:07,051
Don't worry, Reed.

454
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:10,856
My man will be there
with our new friends.

455
00:34:23,094 --> 00:34:26,075
Vikram, you will get a safe
passage from the old ship yard.

456
00:34:26,697 --> 00:34:29,974
Sri Lankan army's Capt.
Ratnayake will be waiting for you.

457
00:34:30,301 --> 00:34:31,575
Just pay him the money

458
00:34:31,636 --> 00:34:33,946
Landing will happen
at: Point Pedro.

459
00:34:44,215 --> 00:34:46,889
Indians are on their way.
Leave now.

460
00:34:46,951 --> 00:34:48,328
Okay. Over and out.

461
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:49,625
Let's go. Let's go.

462
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:50,960
Common hurry

463
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:05,873
Let's move.

464
00:35:12,844 --> 00:35:13,845
Move move, Fast

465
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:15,618
What are LTF rebels
doing here, sir?

466
00:35:15,713 --> 00:35:17,852
KT, something is wrong.
- Let me check.

467
00:35:28,259 --> 00:35:29,260
KT!

468
00:35:31,596 --> 00:35:32,597
Take position

469
00:35:53,684 --> 00:35:54,685
KT!

470
00:36:11,969 --> 00:36:13,915
SP! SP, KT is hit!

471
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:16,610
Send backup!

472
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:23,852
Lets go, lets go

473
00:36:30,621 --> 00:36:32,464
Get up, KT! Get up!

474
00:36:51,943 --> 00:36:53,479
Attention!

475
00:36:55,479 --> 00:36:57,220
Anna these are rocket launchers,

476
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:00,891
and these are AK-47 & AK-56

477
00:37:07,258 --> 00:37:07,998
Hello?

478
00:37:08,092 --> 00:37:10,003
I'm KT's senior
calling from Jaffna.

479
00:37:12,697 --> 00:37:13,767
KT is..

480
00:37:16,634 --> 00:37:17,704
Please, ma'am.

481
00:37:18,936 --> 00:37:20,381
We did all we could do.

482
00:37:29,113 --> 00:37:30,183
Sir.

483
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:32,416
Happy?

484
00:37:32,783 --> 00:37:34,694
We lost an important man

485
00:37:35,052 --> 00:37:36,156
Out! Get out!

486
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:39,428
What had I asked you?

487
00:37:39,824 --> 00:37:42,566
If you can't handle
it by yourself I can help..

488
00:37:42,994 --> 00:37:44,337
Did I or did I not say that?

489
00:37:44,996 --> 00:37:45,997
What now?

490
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:47,404
A marching PKITY?

491
00:37:47,898 --> 00:37:49,343
Sir, someone double-crossed us.

492
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:51,174
Don't give me that bullshit!

493
00:37:51,535 --> 00:37:54,607
Vikram, you know what your problem
is, you think you're too smart!

494
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:57,252
Sir. Trust me, sir.
LTF was not supposed to be there.

495
00:37:57,475 --> 00:37:58,920
I don't know from where
the random firing started.

496
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:00,318
Do you know what
be the result of this?

497
00:38:00,378 --> 00:38:02,016
Anna and Shri,
both of them will hunt us down.

498
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:03,422
Hello? Sir..

499
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:04,949
What!

500
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:06,424
RD sir is on the line.

501
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:14,998
Sure, sir.

502
00:38:15,192 --> 00:38:17,399
I will take control.

503
00:38:18,429 --> 00:38:19,430
Yes.

504
00:38:21,265 --> 00:38:22,676
Now you get out of Jaffna.

505
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,470
Go straight to the
Colombo safe house.

506
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:25,636
And stay there.

507
00:38:43,087 --> 00:38:44,623
Delhi still hasn't
altered its ways.

508
00:38:44,689 --> 00:38:46,396
The same old strategy.

509
00:38:46,457 --> 00:38:49,461
It's not so.
We want to support you.

510
00:38:49,527 --> 00:38:52,064
You gave such a big
arms consignment to LTF.

511
00:38:52,129 --> 00:38:53,699
This is how you'll support us!

512
00:38:53,764 --> 00:38:55,505
There was an ambush.

513
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:57,335
I too lost a man.

514
00:38:57,435 --> 00:39:00,314
The other guy, Vikram,
he came here and made big promises.

515
00:39:01,305 --> 00:39:03,285
Do you know why he is still alive?

516
00:39:03,741 --> 00:39:06,085
I told my men that he's your man.

517
00:39:06,243 --> 00:39:07,654
It was a mistake

518
00:39:07,712 --> 00:39:10,955
Bullshit,
This is how I'll counter Anna?

519
00:39:11,048 --> 00:39:13,858
I'll handle him personally.

520
00:39:14,051 --> 00:39:15,052
24 hours.

521
00:39:16,921 --> 00:39:18,229
Deal with him.

522
00:39:18,422 --> 00:39:22,029
If you don't then I will.

523
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:40,818
He's gone to Capt. Murli's shop.

524
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,788
What happened at the jetty?

525
00:39:43,948 --> 00:39:45,393
I don't know.

526
00:39:45,483 --> 00:39:46,860
Who informed LTF?

527
00:39:47,318 --> 00:39:48,991
I don't know. I really don't know.

528
00:39:49,086 --> 00:39:50,929
No one knew about the arms deal.

529
00:39:50,988 --> 00:39:52,467
How did they find out about it?

530
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:54,797
I don't know, please, sir.
For God's sake.

531
00:39:56,127 --> 00:39:57,538
I don't know, sir.

532
00:40:04,935 --> 00:40:05,970
Right, sir.

533
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:27,767
Keep him alive..
don't kill him

534
00:40:45,209 --> 00:40:46,654
Jaya, the journalist's
room number please.

535
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:47,814
403.

536
00:40:49,313 --> 00:40:50,314
J aya.

537
00:40:52,216 --> 00:40:53,422
Jaya, it's me.

538
00:40:58,656 --> 00:40:59,828
I need to talk to you.

539
00:41:00,658 --> 00:41:02,035
Anna would get the arms.

540
00:41:02,359 --> 00:41:03,599
You knew about it, didn't you?

541
00:41:03,661 --> 00:41:05,641
Is this an official
interrogation, Mr. RAW?

542
00:41:06,397 --> 00:41:08,399
Because if it is, my answer is no.

543
00:41:09,099 --> 00:41:10,305
How did you know?

544
00:41:10,534 --> 00:41:11,945
I need to know.

545
00:41:12,269 --> 00:41:13,270
Excuse me?

546
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:15,144
Why are you asking me this?

547
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:16,843
I have my networks.

548
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:18,613
That's myjob.

549
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:20,948
You should know how it works.

550
00:41:21,011 --> 00:41:22,046
Jaya, please.

551
00:41:22,246 --> 00:41:25,693
If Anna is being made more powerful
There will be repercussions.

552
00:41:26,217 --> 00:41:27,719
The entire peace process will fail.

553
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:30,264
There will be a whole new civil war.
Goddamn it. This is not a game.

554
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:32,793
Vikram, look around.

555
00:41:33,057 --> 00:41:34,900
The peace process
has already failed.

556
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:37,036
And I'm not playing games either.

557
00:41:37,094 --> 00:41:39,233
I'm here because there
human lives are at stake.

558
00:41:40,698 --> 00:41:41,870
Jaya, please.

559
00:41:43,033 --> 00:41:44,239
What do you know?

560
00:41:48,572 --> 00:41:52,384
Look, before I came here
I got a call from my source.

561
00:41:52,877 --> 00:41:55,380
A foreign agency guy
met with an Indian official.

562
00:41:55,613 --> 00:41:57,320
And the leak happened in Bangkok

563
00:42:00,651 --> 00:42:03,029
Was that Indian official from RAW?

564
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:04,222
I don't know.

565
00:42:04,655 --> 00:42:05,793
Look, if he was Raw then you know..

566
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:06,891
Let me tell you,

567
00:42:07,291 --> 00:42:11,000
they know your next move
much before you even implement it.

568
00:42:11,996 --> 00:42:14,101
So you should know about it,
not me.

569
00:42:19,336 --> 00:42:20,337
Vikram.

570
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:23,682
This conversation never happened.

571
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:41,936
Assets can't call be called back.

572
00:42:42,526 --> 00:42:44,005
Specially considering..

573
00:42:48,065 --> 00:42:49,942
Sir, there's some urgent news.

574
00:42:50,067 --> 00:42:51,375
Please have a look at it.

575
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:55,783
'Latest news has just come in from
Sri Lanka that an Indian national..'

576
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:58,613
'..Vikram Singh has been
abducted by the LTF militants.'

577
00:42:58,709 --> 00:42:59,881
'..in the Jaffna area.'

578
00:43:01,211 --> 00:43:03,191
Stay down, stay down..

579
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:05,721
'The Indian High Commission
in Colombo has stated..'

580
00:43:05,816 --> 00:43:07,454
'..they are not aware
of the whereabouts of Vikram.'

581
00:43:07,518 --> 00:43:10,192
This kidnapping is assumed
to be a political kidnapping.

582
00:43:10,321 --> 00:43:12,028
How unstable will
the conditions be?

583
00:43:12,122 --> 00:43:13,123
Or Will the Indian High...

584
00:43:15,859 --> 00:43:17,236
Get me Bala now.

585
00:43:18,062 --> 00:43:20,372
Ma'am, we understand
this is not easy for you.

586
00:43:20,731 --> 00:43:22,608
But this is a political kidnapping.

587
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:24,644
We are negotiating.

588
00:43:27,037 --> 00:43:29,449
But we can approach the
Indian High Commission, right?

589
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:31,252
They can send in the army.

590
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:33,649
After all the army
is responsible, right?

591
00:43:34,411 --> 00:43:36,049
Vikram was on official duty.

592
00:43:36,714 --> 00:43:38,216
He was on official posting.

593
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:44,831
Ma'am, we need to understand
whom we are dealing with.

594
00:43:45,155 --> 00:43:47,601
A dangerous and brutal
terrorist outfit, LTF.

595
00:43:47,691 --> 00:43:49,193
Perhaps even you know about them.

596
00:43:58,936 --> 00:44:01,815
So you mean I should keep mum..

597
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:05,048
...and my husband's life
hangs in the bargain. Right?

598
00:44:05,342 --> 00:44:07,185
Ma'am, we understand your emotions.

599
00:44:07,378 --> 00:44:09,585
But Vikram belongs to us.

600
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:12,793
We will try our best
and bring him back safely.

601
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:18,634
Hello. - What the
hell is happening, Bala?

602
00:44:18,889 --> 00:44:22,302
I don't know, sir. ljust
returned to Madras this morning.

603
00:44:22,459 --> 00:44:26,202
Our best boy gets kidnapped
right from under your nose..

604
00:44:26,263 --> 00:44:28,209
And you're say that you don't know!

605
00:44:28,265 --> 00:44:29,505
I understand, sir.

606
00:44:29,566 --> 00:44:32,445
You are responsible
for whatever happens there.

607
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:34,312
I had warned Vikram.

608
00:44:34,405 --> 00:44:36,885
I told him to be careful.

609
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:44,686
And now LTF is angry..

610
00:44:44,748 --> 00:44:46,819
If LTF is responsible
then talk to them.

611
00:44:46,884 --> 00:44:49,091
Deploy the army if you have to.

612
00:44:49,286 --> 00:44:53,632
Do what you have to but
we want our boy back safely.

613
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:56,570
Sir, I spoke to the
High Commission in Colombo.

614
00:44:56,627 --> 00:44:59,608
You know they won't negotiate.

615
00:44:59,830 --> 00:45:01,400
Fine, sir. I'll leave right away.

616
00:45:01,565 --> 00:45:04,409
I'll leave for the
army base camp right away.

617
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:06,977
Soldier's name: Vikram Singh.

618
00:45:07,071 --> 00:45:08,778
Suspected location: Pallai town.

619
00:45:09,006 --> 00:45:10,576
48kms east from Jaffna.

620
00:45:11,008 --> 00:45:12,214
Bravo one.

621
00:45:12,576 --> 00:45:14,283
Around 5O LTF holding up there.

622
00:45:14,511 --> 00:45:15,956
Ask LTF to leave right now..

623
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:17,955
I have deployed the army.

624
00:45:21,251 --> 00:45:24,198
Target visible. 6O degrees north.

625
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:46,986
Sir, He's alive.

626
00:45:47,077 --> 00:45:48,556
Bravo one to base camp.

627
00:45:48,645 --> 00:45:51,285
Location is empty.
Repeat. Location is empty.

628
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:54,256
Status: Injured but alive.

629
00:46:08,932 --> 00:46:11,310
Here have this you'll feel better.

630
00:46:12,736 --> 00:46:13,942
How do you feel?

631
00:46:15,205 --> 00:46:16,513
Look at your self

632
00:46:17,174 --> 00:46:19,916
Your New Delhi thinks
that it can sit there..

633
00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:22,690
...and manage everything
through a remote control.

634
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:24,090
Nonsense!

635
00:46:24,148 --> 00:46:26,059
In the field, in the jungle..

636
00:46:27,317 --> 00:46:28,990
I'm in control here.

637
00:46:29,553 --> 00:46:31,032
Jaffna is my territory.

638
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:34,398
You wouldn't have survived.
I saved you.

639
00:46:34,792 --> 00:46:35,793
What next?

640
00:46:35,959 --> 00:46:38,405
Oh, your work is done.

641
00:46:38,729 --> 00:46:40,367
Your assignmenfs finished.

642
00:46:40,798 --> 00:46:42,243
Your cover is blown.

643
00:46:42,332 --> 00:46:44,744
You are on the hit-list
of both the camps.

644
00:46:45,068 --> 00:46:47,674
You'll put the agency
in risk if you stay here.

645
00:46:47,771 --> 00:46:49,307
So, you should leave.

646
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:52,345
Enjoy with your wife.

647
00:46:52,409 --> 00:46:53,717
Go on a holiday.

648
00:46:54,845 --> 00:46:58,452
And one more thing, yourjournalist
friend she should leave too.

649
00:46:58,515 --> 00:47:00,017
It's not safe for her here.

650
00:47:10,594 --> 00:47:11,595
SP. Here

651
00:47:12,129 --> 00:47:13,437
Will you help me?

652
00:47:13,597 --> 00:47:14,598
Yes, boss?

653
00:47:14,798 --> 00:47:19,975
Henceforth I want all the information
of Bala's movements and call records.

654
00:47:20,437 --> 00:47:21,472
Okay, boss.

655
00:47:34,284 --> 00:47:35,388
How are you?

656
00:47:36,153 --> 00:47:37,223
I'm fine.

657
00:47:38,722 --> 00:47:40,030
And your injury?

658
00:47:40,924 --> 00:47:45,532
'Ruby. The one whom
I always left back alone.'

659
00:47:46,463 --> 00:47:48,739
'She just had only this one hope.'

660
00:47:49,333 --> 00:47:51,404
'That everything will be fine.'

661
00:47:51,935 --> 00:47:56,406
'I might have been the one at war,
but she too was fighting a battle.'

662
00:47:57,174 --> 00:47:58,278
'With herself.'

663
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:00,150
'With her fears.'

664
00:48:00,677 --> 00:48:02,782
'I had the entire army with me.'

665
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:06,620
But all she had was her belief..'

666
00:48:06,850 --> 00:48:08,454
'That I will come back.'

667
00:48:08,652 --> 00:48:09,653
'Alive.'

668
00:48:28,906 --> 00:48:29,907
How are you?

669
00:48:30,874 --> 00:48:32,376
Alive, for now.

670
00:48:33,010 --> 00:48:35,456
You wouldn't have
survived this time.

671
00:48:36,113 --> 00:48:38,753
LTF was very rigid.

672
00:48:39,483 --> 00:48:40,484
And New Delhi,

673
00:48:41,285 --> 00:48:42,457
you know them well.

674
00:48:43,487 --> 00:48:45,626
Somehow we managed.

675
00:48:48,058 --> 00:48:49,503
But, sir, I got framed.

676
00:48:49,927 --> 00:48:51,065
Twice.

677
00:48:51,695 --> 00:48:52,799
Somehow survived.

678
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:53,931
So,

679
00:48:55,198 --> 00:48:56,438
what went wrong?

680
00:48:57,301 --> 00:48:58,302
What do you think?

681
00:48:58,535 --> 00:49:00,481
Sir, I was not wrong
about the arms deal.

682
00:49:02,539 --> 00:49:04,018
There is a leak amongst us.

683
00:49:07,678 --> 00:49:08,816
So what's your plan?

684
00:49:10,013 --> 00:49:11,014
Thank you, sir.

685
00:49:11,348 --> 00:49:13,055
That I need to figure out.

686
00:49:14,551 --> 00:49:16,360
But before that,
I'll get you Mallaya.

687
00:49:17,587 --> 00:49:18,964
You were right.

688
00:49:20,157 --> 00:49:23,297
To pin down Anna,
we need to crack Mallaya.

689
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:24,866
H ow?

690
00:49:25,529 --> 00:49:27,065
You can't go back in the jungle.

691
00:49:27,364 --> 00:49:28,775
They'll kill you.

692
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:31,543
Sir, with your permission,

693
00:49:33,136 --> 00:49:34,376
let me do it.

694
00:49:36,373 --> 00:49:37,613
Off the record.

695
00:49:38,709 --> 00:49:40,916
You mean no vacation?

696
00:49:48,785 --> 00:49:49,889
I want Mallaya.

697
00:49:50,053 --> 00:49:52,033
Mallaya is the
most dangerous shark.

698
00:49:52,122 --> 00:49:53,567
You're taking a big risk.

699
00:49:54,791 --> 00:49:56,634
You'll get both of us killed.

700
00:50:01,198 --> 00:50:02,438
Fine, I'll see what I can do.

701
00:50:02,733 --> 00:50:03,905
Double money.

702
00:50:06,536 --> 00:50:09,540
Mallaya was Anna's
second in command

703
00:50:10,607 --> 00:50:12,609
Who controlled the
entire east region

704
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:15,717
And getting him onto
our side for the elections...

705
00:50:15,812 --> 00:50:18,918
...meant breking the ITF into 2

706
00:50:21,885 --> 00:50:23,091
I want to meet Mallaya.

707
00:50:23,186 --> 00:50:24,187
Who are you?

708
00:50:24,454 --> 00:50:25,228
Where are you from?

709
00:50:25,322 --> 00:50:26,801
I'm a reporter.

710
00:50:27,290 --> 00:50:28,462
Why do you want to meet Mallaya?

711
00:50:28,558 --> 00:50:30,060
I'm reporting on the war.

712
00:51:29,186 --> 00:51:30,324
Myself Vikram, sir.

713
00:51:34,491 --> 00:51:36,937
So you..

714
00:51:38,495 --> 00:51:40,202
"Want to interview me?

715
00:51:40,397 --> 00:51:41,501
Yes.

716
00:51:41,832 --> 00:51:43,812
I was waiting for you.

717
00:51:44,968 --> 00:51:46,106
You know why?

718
00:51:50,173 --> 00:51:51,948
For what purpose would
a RAW's journalist.

719
00:51:52,709 --> 00:51:56,156
"Out his life at
risk and come here?

720
00:51:56,646 --> 00:51:58,853
Mr. Mallaya,
let me get straight to the point.

721
00:51:59,249 --> 00:52:01,195
My senior wants to meet you.

722
00:52:02,018 --> 00:52:03,019
In Colombo.

723
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:04,995
RD is coming to Colombo?

724
00:52:06,857 --> 00:52:08,564
You know Anna will be very angry.

725
00:52:09,259 --> 00:52:11,068
He wants to meet you, alone.

726
00:52:19,736 --> 00:52:21,477
First you spoke about
breaking the LTF.

727
00:52:21,705 --> 00:52:23,514
Then you prepared TPA against them.

728
00:52:23,707 --> 00:52:25,618
Now you want us to
support the LTF again?

729
00:52:25,742 --> 00:52:28,382
I think we should go ahead with
the Provincial Council Elections.

730
00:52:28,645 --> 00:52:30,522
Pick any three representatives.

731
00:52:30,747 --> 00:52:32,624
Go ahead with the
elections and end this.

732
00:52:32,916 --> 00:52:34,259
Any meaning?

733
00:52:34,351 --> 00:52:35,728
The ones no one knows about?

734
00:52:36,052 --> 00:52:37,122
No one recognizes?

735
00:52:37,354 --> 00:52:39,231
If we want peace...

736
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:42,064
we need the people with us.

737
00:52:42,792 --> 00:52:46,467
And we all know that
people support LTF.

738
00:52:46,663 --> 00:52:48,734
We will have to partner LTF.

739
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:50,611
And I don't mean Anna.

740
00:52:50,734 --> 00:52:53,408
We partner LTF without Anna.

741
00:52:53,570 --> 00:52:58,246
We have been able to penetrate
to his second in command, Mallaya.

742
00:52:59,142 --> 00:53:03,249
He has enough backing of
LTF that he can stand on his own.

743
00:53:03,547 --> 00:53:05,686
As a leader.
- Now who the hell is Mallaya, RD?

744
00:53:05,916 --> 00:53:06,917
Hold on.

745
00:53:07,317 --> 00:53:10,491
If we can still have
the elections then..

746
00:53:10,954 --> 00:53:13,264
...we might find a face saving exit.

747
00:53:13,590 --> 00:53:16,901
Otherwise, in the next 48
hours the PM will have to resign.

748
00:53:21,698 --> 00:53:22,699
Sir.

749
00:53:27,170 --> 00:53:28,171
Try.

750
00:53:32,275 --> 00:53:34,221
So...You went passed me?

751
00:53:35,645 --> 00:53:36,646
Good

752
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:39,524
You met Mallaya.

753
00:53:40,684 --> 00:53:41,992
How did you manage that?

754
00:53:42,285 --> 00:53:44,265
I was just following orders, sir.

755
00:53:44,588 --> 00:53:46,033
Oh, come on!

756
00:53:46,389 --> 00:53:48,835
Don't give me that bullshit.

757
00:53:49,626 --> 00:53:53,301
Conspiring with New Delhi,
that's what you are doing.

758
00:53:53,530 --> 00:53:55,908
There is a leak in my team"

759
00:53:57,834 --> 00:53:58,835
You.

760
00:53:59,135 --> 00:54:01,411
We both are working
for the same government.

761
00:54:02,072 --> 00:54:04,052
You cannot keep implicating me.

762
00:54:04,507 --> 00:54:05,747
If you do that again,

763
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:07,350
lwill not hold back.

764
00:54:09,813 --> 00:54:12,657
And you know,
no one is innocent here.

765
00:54:34,871 --> 00:54:35,872
Hi, Jaya.

766
00:54:36,439 --> 00:54:37,440
Hi.

767
00:54:37,774 --> 00:54:38,809
So you're leaving?

768
00:54:39,276 --> 00:54:40,277
Obviously.

769
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:45,817
They think I work for you now.

770
00:54:48,451 --> 00:54:49,930
But thanks for saving my life.

771
00:54:50,387 --> 00:54:52,264
Look, I'm sorry that
because of me.. - Please.

772
00:54:52,756 --> 00:54:54,758
Don't drag me into
this any further.

773
00:54:55,792 --> 00:55:00,036
As a war correspondent it's important
that I'd be seen as unbiased.

774
00:55:00,463 --> 00:55:02,374
It could ruin everything
that I stand for.

775
00:55:02,565 --> 00:55:04,909
I just wanted you to know
that you are not safe here.

776
00:55:05,869 --> 00:55:07,405
Yeah, I know.

777
00:55:09,205 --> 00:55:10,377
These threats.

778
00:55:11,741 --> 00:55:13,243
Anyway, don't worry.

779
00:55:13,576 --> 00:55:15,556
I promise to remain anti-national.

780
00:55:18,715 --> 00:55:21,457
My office numbers and
my London's personal number.

781
00:55:23,753 --> 00:55:25,892
And, Vikram, be safe.

782
00:55:26,523 --> 00:55:27,524
You too.

783
00:55:58,855 --> 00:56:00,232
Please have your tea.

784
00:56:00,557 --> 00:56:02,468
I don't enjoy such things.

785
00:56:02,926 --> 00:56:04,132
Istay in thejungle.

786
00:56:04,194 --> 00:56:07,232
That's why Anna
operates like a tyrant?

787
00:56:08,431 --> 00:56:10,172
He's openly into brutality.

788
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:12,204
But it won't last for long.

789
00:56:12,502 --> 00:56:17,144
No matter where Anna is hiding
in this island, we will find him.

790
00:56:17,574 --> 00:56:20,020
And the elections
will be held peacefully.

791
00:56:20,677 --> 00:56:22,020
But what after that?

792
00:56:23,179 --> 00:56:26,023
Who will be the new leader?
Have you ever given that a thought?

793
00:56:27,117 --> 00:56:29,393
It was a mistake coming here.

794
00:56:29,753 --> 00:56:33,360
The mistake is that you
guys are addicted to war.

795
00:56:33,623 --> 00:56:36,866
Hanging cyanide capsules
around the neck of small children,

796
00:56:36,926 --> 00:56:38,405
making them into turn militants...

797
00:56:38,928 --> 00:56:40,305
ls this your war?

798
00:56:41,398 --> 00:56:43,969
You are snatching
away their future.

799
00:56:44,534 --> 00:56:48,311
The Tamilians can
get their rights back..

800
00:56:48,605 --> 00:56:51,142
...only through
a political solution.

801
00:56:52,208 --> 00:56:53,949
And you can do so,
by being their leader.

802
00:56:54,878 --> 00:56:56,186
Not through war.

803
00:56:58,148 --> 00:56:59,320
Our offer is clear.

804
00:57:02,118 --> 00:57:04,962
And what if I refuse?

805
00:57:05,922 --> 00:57:07,265
You have no option.

806
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:09,434
Enjoy your tea.

807
00:57:12,362 --> 00:57:13,773
Vikram, phase three.

808
00:57:14,097 --> 00:57:15,371
Get Anna. - Sir.

809
00:57:15,465 --> 00:57:17,376
Mallaya will give
you Anna's location.

810
00:57:18,101 --> 00:57:19,876
Brief the army special forces.

811
00:57:19,969 --> 00:57:22,040
We want Anna at any cost.

812
00:57:22,172 --> 00:57:23,116
Right, sir.

813
00:57:23,173 --> 00:57:24,618
Mission Extract Anna.

814
00:57:24,874 --> 00:57:25,944
Two platoons.

815
00:57:26,142 --> 00:57:28,713
One will land in the
east and the other in north.

816
00:57:28,845 --> 00:57:29,846
Vikram..

817
00:57:30,013 --> 00:57:31,959
This is the position
of the LTF camp.

818
00:57:32,248 --> 00:57:33,727
500 meters in diameter.

819
00:57:33,850 --> 00:57:35,693
The whole region is
covered with landmines.

820
00:57:35,852 --> 00:57:37,729
This will be our dropping point.
Pottai lake.

821
00:57:37,921 --> 00:57:40,026
Remember,
we have only eight minutes.

822
00:57:43,493 --> 00:57:47,669
Vikram, yourjob in Jaffna
is over for the time being.

823
00:57:48,331 --> 00:57:50,641
Immediately station
yourself in Kerala.

824
00:57:51,067 --> 00:57:54,514
Wait for further orders. Leave now.

825
00:58:06,449 --> 00:58:07,723
He's not here.. its empty

826
00:58:28,605 --> 00:58:29,606
Target locked.

827
00:58:54,731 --> 00:58:56,768
Cover up! Cover up!

828
00:58:59,636 --> 00:59:00,580
Come on!

829
00:59:00,803 --> 00:59:02,043
Fast...

830
00:59:14,517 --> 00:59:17,327
Anna.. southern side..
In the bunker.. this way.

831
00:59:59,963 --> 01:00:01,237
'I survived.'

832
01:00:01,531 --> 01:00:03,135
'I came back to India.'

833
01:00:03,266 --> 01:00:06,145
'But myjob was still incomplete.'

834
01:00:06,769 --> 01:00:09,375
'Bala. I knew he was the leak.'

835
01:00:10,239 --> 01:00:12,879
But I needed concrete evidence.

836
01:00:19,682 --> 01:00:21,286
What happened, Vikram?

837
01:00:26,122 --> 01:00:27,226
Those faces,

838
01:00:28,725 --> 01:00:30,033
those killings..

839
01:00:31,127 --> 01:00:33,004
Something doesn't seem right, Ruby.

840
01:00:34,931 --> 01:00:36,035
Just let go.

841
01:00:50,580 --> 01:00:54,995
'As per the latest news
received LTF leader Anna is dead.'

842
01:01:03,626 --> 01:01:06,334
'The news of Anna's death
spread like wild fire.'

843
01:01:06,963 --> 01:01:08,567
'The whole island was in shock.'

844
01:01:09,465 --> 01:01:10,671
'The whole world believed us.'

845
01:01:11,601 --> 01:01:13,740
'And we too,
believed that ourjob was done.'

846
01:01:13,803 --> 01:01:17,478
Long live Mallaya!
Our leader Mallaya.

847
01:01:18,141 --> 01:01:21,816
'Mallaya declared himself
as the new leader of LTF.'

848
01:01:23,813 --> 01:01:24,814
'But..'

849
01:01:24,881 --> 01:01:26,087
'Anna was alive.'

850
01:01:39,328 --> 01:01:40,773
Why did you do this?

851
01:01:41,631 --> 01:01:44,111
No one can betray our ELAM.

852
01:01:50,973 --> 01:01:54,045
'And now,
it was impossible to stop Anna.'

853
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:02,993
'He became the undisputed
leader of North-East Sri Lanka.'

854
01:02:03,319 --> 01:02:06,493
'And now much more ferocious.'

855
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:13,003
'Prime Minister
has resigned today.'

856
01:02:13,362 --> 01:02:15,706
'Due to an unexpected
development this morning..'

857
01:02:15,765 --> 01:02:18,302
'..he took this step
under political pressure.'

858
01:02:18,401 --> 01:02:21,007
'Because of the change
in the political scenario...

859
01:02:21,738 --> 01:02:23,877
...in Delhi, PM resigned.'

860
01:02:24,307 --> 01:02:26,947
'A week after the new
government came into power..'

861
01:02:27,910 --> 01:02:31,517
'..our army was called
back from Lanka.'

862
01:02:32,849 --> 01:02:34,726
'This was a victory for Anna,'

863
01:02:35,618 --> 01:02:38,155
'against the world's fourth
largest military force.'

864
01:02:41,858 --> 01:02:44,600
From here on began
the grand conspiracy.

865
01:02:45,461 --> 01:02:47,964
The final assassination plot.

866
01:02:49,332 --> 01:02:52,040
So, is this the reason
why we lost our Prime Minister?

867
01:02:53,369 --> 01:02:58,512
Fresh elections were announced
a year after his resignation.

868
01:03:00,243 --> 01:03:02,348
'During the election campaign,'

869
01:03:02,578 --> 01:03:03,716
'at a press conference..'

870
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:05,225
'..ex-prime minister...'

871
01:03:05,648 --> 01:03:07,958
'..announced his political
agenda for the next elections.'

872
01:03:08,084 --> 01:03:09,859
Tamil cause be an important
issue for you this time as well?

873
01:03:09,986 --> 01:03:13,524
If we do come into power,
apart from economic growth"

874
01:03:13,823 --> 01:03:15,769
...Tamil cause will be
an important issue for me.

875
01:03:16,125 --> 01:03:17,331
That there is Peace in the island.

876
01:03:17,426 --> 01:03:19,428
That the Tamilians
should get their rights.

877
01:03:19,662 --> 01:03:21,141
This is what we will aim for.

878
01:03:22,031 --> 01:03:23,169
'Peace in the island.'

879
01:03:23,232 --> 01:03:25,337
'Tamilians should
get their rights.'

880
01:03:25,802 --> 01:03:27,509
'This is what we will aim for.'

881
01:03:27,737 --> 01:03:32,186
'My stand is clear. I want
a peaceful political solution.'

882
01:03:33,976 --> 01:03:36,684
'A month after this speech,

883
01:03:37,713 --> 01:03:40,819
'our Madras Desk and
South-East Naval force..'

884
01:03:41,417 --> 01:03:43,488
intercepted
some coded messages.'

885
01:04:03,773 --> 01:04:05,753
Reed, the meeting is fixed.

886
01:04:06,209 --> 01:04:10,817
'And perhaps from here on that the
grand conspiracy began took shape.'

887
01:04:20,623 --> 01:04:21,624
Guruji...

888
01:04:21,757 --> 01:04:24,033
We need to act and
this is the perfect time.

889
01:04:24,460 --> 01:04:25,632
You fix up the meeting.

890
01:05:04,967 --> 01:05:07,470
You just wait there.
I'll tell you what. Okay.

891
01:05:07,737 --> 01:05:08,738
SpeakYa...

892
01:05:09,171 --> 01:05:10,172
What is it?

893
01:05:10,673 --> 01:05:13,279
Sir, these are the
Intercepts of last few days.

894
01:05:13,576 --> 01:05:16,785
I've collected some
from the Naval intelligence.

895
01:05:17,046 --> 01:05:18,855
Sir, since From the past few
days this the wireless chatter"

896
01:05:18,915 --> 01:05:21,486
"between London, Jaffna and Singapore
has seems to have increased, sir.

897
01:05:25,888 --> 01:05:28,368
Yes, it's okay.
It's routine. You may leave.

898
01:05:28,457 --> 01:05:30,937
No, sir. One of the speakers
voices is that of Anna's.

899
01:05:31,027 --> 01:05:35,908
Look, I'll see look into what's
important or what's not, in it.

900
01:05:36,832 --> 01:05:38,277
But doesn't this sound
seem quite serious?

901
01:05:38,334 --> 01:05:39,711
Go. Leave.

902
01:05:42,338 --> 01:05:45,649
Listen, you're doing a good job.

903
01:05:46,642 --> 01:05:48,918
Keep me in the loop.

904
01:05:49,478 --> 01:05:50,479
Okay, sir.

905
01:06:59,682 --> 01:07:01,127
Hello? Hello?

906
01:07:01,217 --> 01:07:02,423
Vikram's residence, sir.

907
01:07:11,127 --> 01:07:12,128
The file is missing.

908
01:07:12,294 --> 01:07:13,568
Sir, spool..

909
01:07:15,931 --> 01:07:17,706
Bloody hell..

910
01:07:39,055 --> 01:07:40,500
They are both in Cochin.

911
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:42,494
Send your men there.

912
01:07:55,905 --> 01:07:57,009
Hello?

913
01:07:58,340 --> 01:07:59,341
Hello?

914
01:08:35,444 --> 01:08:36,445
Hello?

915
01:08:36,679 --> 01:08:37,749
Hello, Ruby?

916
01:08:38,047 --> 01:08:39,583
Where are you, Vikram?

917
01:08:39,849 --> 01:08:42,193
Why? - These pictures
and articles.

918
01:08:43,319 --> 01:08:44,889
Something isjust not right.

919
01:08:45,321 --> 01:08:46,766
Whom do you work for?

920
01:08:48,657 --> 01:08:49,931
Listen, don't worry.
I'm coming home.

921
01:08:49,992 --> 01:08:51,130
Don't open the door for anyone.

922
01:08:51,193 --> 01:08:52,194
Okay?

923
01:08:56,699 --> 01:08:57,734
Ruby!

924
01:09:00,002 --> 01:09:01,003
Ruby.

925
01:09:06,442 --> 01:09:07,750
Whom do you work for?

926
01:09:08,410 --> 01:09:09,514
We aren't safe here.

927
01:09:09,612 --> 01:09:11,785
In your absence our house is
under surveillance in your absence.

928
01:09:11,881 --> 01:09:14,088
We're shifting to Delhi.
- I'm being shadowed.

929
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:15,254
Trust me, we have to move on.

930
01:09:15,317 --> 01:09:16,887
That's not the answer, Vikram.

931
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:21,834
These pictures, these killings, these
articles, the foreign journalist..

932
01:09:21,891 --> 01:09:23,495
This is not army.

933
01:09:24,426 --> 01:09:25,928
You killed civilians?

934
01:09:28,464 --> 01:09:30,273
These killings are
political killings.

935
01:09:30,733 --> 01:09:32,440
Jaya, she is a foreign journalist.

936
01:09:32,501 --> 01:09:34,879
Trust me, this is a setup.
I can explain this.. - You jerk.

937
01:09:35,437 --> 01:09:37,747
All these days, you lied to me.

938
01:09:38,774 --> 01:09:40,811
Ruby, I do covert operations.

939
01:09:41,343 --> 01:09:44,381
I monitor political and military
developments of different countries.

940
01:09:44,947 --> 01:09:47,359
This country's security
is my responsibility.

941
01:09:47,783 --> 01:09:50,263
We have been married for three years.
I know there is a responsibility.

942
01:09:50,319 --> 01:09:51,457
But there is a protocol.
But I am not a..

943
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:53,625
I don't care about your protocol,
alright!

944
01:09:53,956 --> 01:09:55,458
I'm your wife, damn it!

945
01:09:55,958 --> 01:09:57,198
I have a right to know.

946
01:09:58,627 --> 01:09:59,662
What about me..

947
01:10:01,463 --> 01:10:02,806
How do I deal with all this?

948
01:10:04,867 --> 01:10:05,868
Sri Lan ka..

949
01:10:06,902 --> 01:10:10,645
Your life was constantly
under threat there.

950
01:10:11,373 --> 01:10:15,150
Do you have any
idea how I survived?

951
01:10:17,112 --> 01:10:19,149
And today I got petrified, Vikram.
- Sweetheart.

952
01:10:21,083 --> 01:10:22,187
Just leave me alone.

953
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:25,221
Ru..

954
01:10:26,088 --> 01:10:27,089
Ruby.

955
01:10:35,197 --> 01:10:36,904
Hello? - Boss, SP.

956
01:10:37,533 --> 01:10:38,534
I'm in Cochin.

957
01:10:38,734 --> 01:10:40,213
We should need to meet.
It's urgent.

958
01:10:40,302 --> 01:10:41,975
Right away? - Sorry, sir.

959
01:10:43,005 --> 01:10:45,007
I don't have much time.
We'll talk when we meet.

960
01:10:45,107 --> 01:10:46,950
At seven. Beach café.

961
01:10:47,176 --> 01:10:48,177
Okay.

962
01:10:48,444 --> 01:10:51,323
Ruby.. - I know you have to go.
Just go.

963
01:11:08,330 --> 01:11:09,331
Hello, boss.

964
01:11:11,300 --> 01:11:13,576
Something really seems
to be out of order in Madras.

965
01:11:13,969 --> 01:11:17,143
A lot of intercepts and wireless
messages are being exchanged.

966
01:11:17,473 --> 01:11:18,781
From Jaffna to London.

967
01:11:18,974 --> 01:11:20,612
Madras, Singapore.

968
01:11:21,076 --> 01:11:23,147
And One of the voices
is that of speakers is Anna's.

969
01:11:31,954 --> 01:11:33,763
I've decoded some keywords.

970
01:11:34,290 --> 01:11:37,203
Like - Foreign friend.
Negotiate. Middle-east.

971
01:11:37,293 --> 01:11:38,397
Does Bala know?

972
01:11:38,494 --> 01:11:40,440
Yes, I've shared them with him.

973
01:11:40,996 --> 01:11:43,670
But he asked me not
to file or decode them.

974
01:11:48,637 --> 01:11:51,083
And His behavior has
really scared me, boss.

975
01:11:52,141 --> 01:11:54,212
I feel you are
not safe here either.

976
01:11:56,378 --> 01:11:58,221
What should I do next?

977
01:11:59,748 --> 01:12:00,749
Just stay safe.

978
01:12:01,450 --> 01:12:02,588
I'll see what I can do.

979
01:12:31,013 --> 01:12:32,014
Ruby.

980
01:12:35,417 --> 01:12:36,725
Ruby! Ruby!

981
01:12:39,021 --> 01:12:40,022
Ruby!

982
01:12:42,691 --> 01:12:43,692
Ruby!

983
01:15:22,851 --> 01:15:23,852
Why her?

984
01:15:25,787 --> 01:15:26,788
Why?

985
01:15:50,078 --> 01:15:51,079
Vikram..

986
01:15:51,947 --> 01:15:52,948
I'm sorry.

987
01:15:53,849 --> 01:15:54,953
Your loss..

988
01:15:57,219 --> 01:15:58,289
What should I say?

989
01:15:58,820 --> 01:15:59,821
Tough times.

990
01:16:00,422 --> 01:16:05,735
You know my wife and
my children keep asking me:

991
01:16:06,128 --> 01:16:07,630
Why do you do this?

992
01:16:08,564 --> 01:16:13,411
There's a lot of danger.
Your Life's always at risk.

993
01:16:13,936 --> 01:16:19,386
How do I explain to them that our
country is surrounded by vultures?

994
01:16:19,975 --> 01:16:21,283
We need to protect it...

995
01:16:21,410 --> 01:16:22,912
How much will they understand?

996
01:16:23,745 --> 01:16:25,053
That's why I don't say anything.

997
01:16:26,448 --> 01:16:29,952
Vikram, you need to bounce back.

998
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:33,522
Anyway, you are not safe here.

999
01:16:33,956 --> 01:16:35,867
I'm not safe anywhere, sir.

1000
01:16:36,091 --> 01:16:37,934
You cannot give up
on the system so soon!

1001
01:16:39,761 --> 01:16:40,762
System!

1002
01:16:41,163 --> 01:16:42,642
We Which we know it inside out!

1003
01:16:43,231 --> 01:16:44,539
I need you.

1004
01:16:45,801 --> 01:16:47,803
We've got your intercepts.

1005
01:16:48,437 --> 01:16:49,711
They are being decoded.

1006
01:16:51,006 --> 01:16:53,384
And what you've said about Bala

1007
01:16:53,875 --> 01:16:55,218
I hope you are right about Bala.

1008
01:16:55,510 --> 01:16:57,786
God forbid if you are wrong,

1009
01:16:58,347 --> 01:17:00,725
you'll be in great risk.

1010
01:17:01,249 --> 01:17:02,751
It's a big accusation.

1011
01:17:06,254 --> 01:17:09,463
I know, sir.
I need to sort this out.

1012
01:17:10,626 --> 01:17:13,470
If you don't start begin
surveillance in the next 24 hours..

1013
01:17:14,830 --> 01:17:16,537
...then I'll get
the evidence myself.

1014
01:17:18,767 --> 01:17:20,075
And I'll do it my way.

1015
01:17:28,543 --> 01:17:29,351
Sir.

1016
01:17:29,411 --> 01:17:31,118
We've got a fix on Vasu's location.

1017
01:17:31,213 --> 01:17:33,318
He's constantly shifting his base.

1018
01:17:33,382 --> 01:17:35,953
And But his last call
was traced to old Delhi.

1019
01:18:05,013 --> 01:18:06,515
Stop! Stop! Stop!

1020
01:18:07,382 --> 01:18:09,521
Get down! Get down! - Get down!

1021
01:18:19,094 --> 01:18:22,598
Bala recruited you for the agency
from the Jammu district jail.

1022
01:18:28,704 --> 01:18:30,684
Information was leaked
from our system.

1023
01:18:32,874 --> 01:18:35,855
They knew our operational details.

1024
01:18:39,014 --> 01:18:40,220
What do you know?

1025
01:18:42,250 --> 01:18:43,729
You'll have to speak up, Vasu.

1026
01:18:45,387 --> 01:18:46,730
You know the consequences.

1027
01:18:48,156 --> 01:18:50,067
I just photocopied the files.

1028
01:18:50,826 --> 01:18:51,804
For whom?

1029
01:18:51,860 --> 01:18:53,032
I don't know.

1030
01:18:54,429 --> 01:18:56,773
Myjob was to drop
them to at the airport.

1031
01:18:58,834 --> 01:19:00,177
Bala sir's instructions.

1032
01:19:01,036 --> 01:19:02,413
And Shree's Shri's arms deal?

1033
01:19:02,738 --> 01:19:04,240
We lost a our man.

1034
01:19:04,573 --> 01:19:05,608
You were there as well.

1035
01:19:06,408 --> 01:19:07,443
Reverse the car

1036
01:19:08,443 --> 01:19:10,081
Who informed the LTF?

1037
01:19:12,948 --> 01:19:14,222
You? - I've told you.

1038
01:19:15,650 --> 01:19:17,425
I just followed instructions.

1039
01:19:18,820 --> 01:19:20,163
What happened that night?

1040
01:19:23,525 --> 01:19:25,835
What happened on the night
SP brought the intercepts, Vasu?

1041
01:19:27,896 --> 01:19:30,399
That was the first time
I saw Bala sir getting panicked.

1042
01:19:31,032 --> 01:19:32,636
'The file is missing!'

1043
01:19:34,336 --> 01:19:36,543
He held me by my collar.

1044
01:19:38,340 --> 01:19:39,842
He W35 very nervous.

1045
01:19:40,442 --> 01:19:41,386
Why?

1046
01:19:41,443 --> 01:19:43,821
Don't worry.
Those intercepts are with me.'

1047
01:19:43,945 --> 01:19:46,425
Your department is moving along..

1048
01:19:48,917 --> 01:19:50,624
A few of his
intercepts were stolen.

1049
01:19:51,086 --> 01:19:52,394
He doubted suspected SP.

1050
01:19:53,388 --> 01:19:55,265
So he asked me to tail SP.

1051
01:19:56,491 --> 01:19:57,492
And?

1052
01:19:58,260 --> 01:19:59,705
He got a call from Singapore.

1053
01:20:00,028 --> 01:20:01,871
From? - Some Reed.

1054
01:20:02,097 --> 01:20:06,910
'You just make sure those
intercepts do not reach anyone.'

1055
01:20:07,102 --> 01:20:08,479
I've never seen him.

1056
01:20:09,437 --> 01:20:10,541
He used to call.

1057
01:20:11,339 --> 01:20:13,979
'A foreign agency guy
met with an Indian official.'

1058
01:20:15,710 --> 01:20:18,714
Did Bala know what did
those intercepts contain?

1059
01:20:18,814 --> 01:20:19,724
No.

1060
01:20:19,815 --> 01:20:21,726
Those intercepts weren't decoded.

1061
01:20:24,452 --> 01:20:25,624
Where is SP now?

1062
01:20:25,720 --> 01:20:26,892
I don't know.

1063
01:20:27,923 --> 01:20:29,527
Who sent you to Delhi?

1064
01:20:30,559 --> 01:20:32,436
Bala sir asked me to...

1065
01:20:34,429 --> 01:20:37,535
...disappear from Madras
safe house after your incident.

1066
01:20:38,667 --> 01:20:40,544
And Who gave the orders...

1067
01:20:42,237 --> 01:20:43,477
...to kill me and SP?

1068
01:20:56,451 --> 01:20:57,486
Vasu..

1069
01:20:58,086 --> 01:21:01,659
While following orders
from Bala did you ever realize..

1070
01:21:02,424 --> 01:21:04,233
...that you'll be such
a disgrace for the system?

1071
01:21:06,294 --> 01:21:07,466
Such a shame.

1072
01:21:11,499 --> 01:21:13,308
Hello? Yes, you want to speak to?

1073
01:21:13,401 --> 01:21:14,311
Jaya Sahni, please.

1074
01:21:14,402 --> 01:21:17,042
Jaya Sahni?
And you're calling from? - India.

1075
01:21:17,305 --> 01:21:18,716
One moment please.

1076
01:21:20,308 --> 01:21:23,050
I understand, ma.
Don't worry. I'm fine.

1077
01:21:24,246 --> 01:21:25,247
I'll call you back.

1078
01:21:25,580 --> 01:21:26,752
Call from India.

1079
01:21:27,449 --> 01:21:29,224
Hello? - Hi, Jaya.

1080
01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:33,521
Hi.

1081
01:21:34,823 --> 01:21:35,927
How are you?

1082
01:21:36,658 --> 01:21:38,160
Jaya, I need your help.

1083
01:21:43,064 --> 01:21:44,202
I told you, Vikram.

1084
01:21:45,166 --> 01:21:46,577
I won't be able to help you.

1085
01:21:47,936 --> 01:21:49,472
I can't give you my sources.

1086
01:21:49,738 --> 01:21:51,945
All our intels have been leaked..

1087
01:21:52,874 --> 01:21:54,148
To this guy called Reed.

1088
01:21:55,110 --> 01:21:57,920
So, it was one of your guys.
- Yes.

1089
01:21:59,114 --> 01:22:00,752
And he is a national threat.

1090
01:22:02,550 --> 01:22:03,995
So what do you want from me?

1091
01:22:04,619 --> 01:22:05,996
I need evidence.

1092
01:22:07,255 --> 01:22:08,825
That's why, I need your sources.

1093
01:22:14,195 --> 01:22:15,196
Okay.

1094
01:22:15,597 --> 01:22:16,701
I'll call you back.

1095
01:22:17,332 --> 01:22:18,470
Than ks, Jaya.

1096
01:22:19,301 --> 01:22:22,578
And, Vikram, I'm really,
really sorry about your wife.

1097
01:22:24,639 --> 01:22:25,640
Thank you.

1098
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:36,756
Reed, you your man
Bala is a risk for us.

1099
01:22:39,688 --> 01:22:42,897
His cover is blown
and he's being tracked.

1100
01:22:43,325 --> 01:22:45,464
You want me to lose him? - Yes.

1101
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:46,761
Right.

1102
01:22:55,603 --> 01:22:57,981
'Okay, Vikram. Reach Bangkok.'

1103
01:22:58,840 --> 01:23:00,842
'Take Taxi No. 5892.'

1104
01:23:02,477 --> 01:23:05,617
'He will take you to
Happyland fish market.'

1105
01:23:09,217 --> 01:23:11,026
'Ask for Shop No. 29.'

1106
01:23:11,386 --> 01:23:12,592
'My source will meet you there.'

1107
01:23:13,288 --> 01:23:16,201
This way to shop no. 29 - That way

1108
01:23:31,506 --> 01:23:32,917
So you are Vikram?

1109
01:23:33,241 --> 01:23:34,811
And You need evidence?

1110
01:23:35,510 --> 01:23:36,511
Yes.

1111
01:23:37,078 --> 01:23:38,648
You are in the right direction.

1112
01:23:38,847 --> 01:23:43,489
According to my source there
is a tape and we'll get it by five.

1113
01:23:43,852 --> 01:23:45,456
Since when have you
been tracking Bala?

1114
01:23:45,653 --> 01:23:47,860
Before and after I retired
a lot of activity took place..

1115
01:23:48,289 --> 01:23:51,827
"Between Madras,
Jaffna and Singapore.

1116
01:23:52,093 --> 01:23:54,471
I did some surveillance.
I reported it as well.

1117
01:23:54,829 --> 01:23:56,706
But I didn't have
concrete evidence.

1118
01:23:57,332 --> 01:24:00,108
When I found out that
you're investigating the case,

1119
01:24:01,036 --> 01:24:02,447
I agreed to meet you.

1120
01:24:02,904 --> 01:24:05,578
Vikram, you are
very close to reality.

1121
01:24:08,076 --> 01:24:09,555
Who is Reed? - I don't know.

1122
01:24:10,078 --> 01:24:11,250
It could be anyone.

1123
01:24:11,379 --> 01:24:12,983
Maybe a faceless handler.

1124
01:24:13,048 --> 01:24:14,686
Apart from there this...

1125
01:24:14,783 --> 01:24:17,161
...a lot of other activities took
place that too raise arouse suspicion.

1126
01:24:17,652 --> 01:24:18,653
Look at this.

1127
01:24:21,723 --> 01:24:23,361
Rajsekharan at Madras Café!

1128
01:24:24,225 --> 01:24:26,296
Yes. The meeting
took place in Singapore.

1129
01:24:27,062 --> 01:24:28,439
Two meetings took place there.

1130
01:24:28,863 --> 01:24:30,433
In the second meeting
Rajsekharan was introduced.

1131
01:24:30,498 --> 01:24:32,205
He was representing Anna.

1132
01:24:32,534 --> 01:24:34,036
'So you need our support?'

1133
01:24:35,503 --> 01:24:37,813
It means that developments of...

1134
01:24:38,306 --> 01:24:40,013
...that meeting changed
the whole politics.

1135
01:24:40,108 --> 01:24:41,712
Yes. Do you remember
the date of arms deal?

1136
01:24:41,810 --> 01:24:43,255
6th July. I was there.

1137
01:24:43,778 --> 01:24:45,451
This meeting took place
on the second2nd July.

1138
01:24:45,613 --> 01:24:47,422
Exactly four days
before the arms deal.

1139
01:24:47,949 --> 01:24:49,986
'Gifts are on the
way from Singapore.'

1140
01:24:50,185 --> 01:24:51,994
'Be sure they reach
our new friends.'

1141
01:24:52,420 --> 01:24:55,560
'Don't worry, Reed.
My man will be there.'

1142
01:24:55,857 --> 01:24:58,337
That's why the arms which
were meant to go to Shree..

1143
01:24:58,593 --> 01:25:01,199
...and after those instructions,
went to Anna.

1144
01:25:01,696 --> 01:25:02,697
Right.

1145
01:25:03,565 --> 01:25:06,409
'Hey hurry up, common..

1146
01:25:07,502 --> 01:25:09,880
And perhaps Anna
found a new partner.

1147
01:25:10,105 --> 01:25:11,209
Who are these people?

1148
01:25:11,306 --> 01:25:14,515
Corporations,
big countries, big organizations.

1149
01:25:14,609 --> 01:25:16,316
Who seek They need
economic control,

1150
01:25:16,411 --> 01:25:19,017
business deals,
large arms contracts"

1151
01:25:19,214 --> 01:25:21,785
And Their executors
are ex-agency employees.

1152
01:25:21,916 --> 01:25:23,987
They are called economic hitmen.

1153
01:25:24,052 --> 01:25:25,827
Who are these people?
Where do they meet?

1154
01:25:25,887 --> 01:25:26,888
No one knows.

1155
01:25:26,988 --> 01:25:30,265
Remember, Vikram, India
is the fastest growing market.

1156
01:25:30,658 --> 01:25:32,001
India is the future.

1157
01:25:32,093 --> 01:25:33,265
That's why an attempt
there is to...

1158
01:25:33,328 --> 01:25:34,864
...pressurpressurize her
e from everywhere all corners.

1159
01:25:35,096 --> 01:25:37,098
This is the modern day warfare.

1160
01:25:37,599 --> 01:25:39,408
That's why Trincomalee dock.

1161
01:25:39,634 --> 01:25:41,841
This Lankan coastline
is so strategic for everyone.

1162
01:25:41,970 --> 01:25:44,814
Yes. And that's why
they are supporting Anna...

1163
01:25:45,006 --> 01:25:46,644
...if Anna comes to power...

1164
01:25:46,708 --> 01:25:48,483
...then they will gain control...

1165
01:25:48,710 --> 01:25:51,714
...over entire South
East Asia via Trincomalee Dock

1166
01:25:52,147 --> 01:25:55,060
...and that would a
national threat for India

1167
01:25:55,583 --> 01:25:58,189
That's the reason why ex-PM
is not so popular with them.

1168
01:25:58,920 --> 01:25:59,990
He doesn't want war.

1169
01:26:00,355 --> 01:26:03,097
He wants a peaceful
political solution.

1170
01:26:03,391 --> 01:26:04,529
And that's why Anna.

1171
01:26:04,592 --> 01:26:05,764
Anna is an idealist.

1172
01:26:06,027 --> 01:26:08,735
And He'll he will continue the
war till he doesn't get freedom.

1173
01:26:08,997 --> 01:26:10,772
And they will exploit this.

1174
01:26:11,933 --> 01:26:13,139
Wait here. - Okay.

1175
01:26:18,573 --> 01:26:19,847
Package please.

1176
01:26:26,548 --> 01:26:28,357
Your evidence. Let's go.

1177
01:26:47,202 --> 01:26:48,875
Nasal. - Nasal.

1178
01:26:49,204 --> 01:26:50,683
Ilpa- Pal

1179
01:26:56,277 --> 01:26:57,278
Ant.

1180
01:26:59,147 --> 01:27:00,125
What have we got?

1181
01:27:01,849 --> 01:27:04,762
They are possibly discussing an
assassination of a national leader.

1182
01:27:10,959 --> 01:27:13,701
Sir, the intercepts.
Two of them have been decoded.

1183
01:27:16,965 --> 01:27:18,137
Have you informed RD?

1184
01:27:18,700 --> 01:27:20,543
Not yet, sir.
I was waiting for you.

1185
01:27:30,345 --> 01:27:31,346
Bala?

1186
01:27:39,254 --> 01:27:40,699
So they trapped him.

1187
01:27:40,822 --> 01:27:41,823
Honeytrap.

1188
01:27:42,390 --> 01:27:44,336
Oldest trick of the intel world.

1189
01:27:45,059 --> 01:27:47,130
L, too, doubted Had my
doubts about him but this..

1190
01:27:47,862 --> 01:27:49,705
So they exposed Bala.

1191
01:27:50,531 --> 01:27:52,602
Perhaps Bala had
become useless for them.

1192
01:27:52,900 --> 01:27:57,849
The And they either eliminate
or expose the useless.

1193
01:27:58,139 --> 01:27:59,675
This is how our world works.

1194
01:28:07,782 --> 01:28:08,783
This better be good.

1195
01:28:08,883 --> 01:28:10,260
This is serious, sir.

1196
01:28:10,952 --> 01:28:14,661
The intercepts we got
from Vikram have been decoded.

1197
01:28:15,156 --> 01:28:16,191
You better see it.

1198
01:28:18,526 --> 01:28:19,766
Sir, that's Anna's voice.

1199
01:28:19,861 --> 01:28:21,431
It originated from his camp.

1200
01:28:22,263 --> 01:28:23,264
The words, sir.

1201
01:28:23,464 --> 01:28:25,944
Garland. Important. Leader.

1202
01:28:27,669 --> 01:28:29,376
They are going for
the ex-prime minister.

1203
01:28:30,938 --> 01:28:32,417
Get me Vikram. ASAP.

1204
01:28:32,974 --> 01:28:35,386
Sir, there's one more thing.

1205
01:28:35,810 --> 01:28:37,687
Bala's surveillance report.

1206
01:28:38,313 --> 01:28:39,485
Bank accounts.

1207
01:28:39,681 --> 01:28:42,321
Income worth thousands
of dollars from unknown accounts.

1208
01:28:42,784 --> 01:28:46,163
Five fake passports.
Eight tickets to Singapore.

1209
01:28:47,955 --> 01:28:49,696
Everyone perceives
the truth differently.

1210
01:28:50,325 --> 01:28:52,066
It depends on where
you are choose to stand.

1211
01:28:52,226 --> 01:28:54,706
Remember, my friend.
This meeting never happened.

1212
01:28:59,033 --> 01:29:01,673
Bala, your tape has been released,
you must leave now..

1213
01:29:09,477 --> 01:29:11,013
Sir, I have evidence.

1214
01:29:12,347 --> 01:29:13,587
He was honey-trapped.

1215
01:29:13,648 --> 01:29:15,321
He compromised everything.

1216
01:29:16,250 --> 01:29:17,957
I believe they blackmailed him.

1217
01:29:18,186 --> 01:29:19,164
Yes, Vikram.

1218
01:29:19,253 --> 01:29:21,290
We, too, know about
his secret bank accounts.

1219
01:29:21,356 --> 01:29:23,927
...fake passports
and travel details.

1220
01:29:25,393 --> 01:29:28,169
He didn't just sell us out.
He sold out the entire country.

1221
01:29:29,530 --> 01:29:31,908
Now you let the
department handle him.

1222
01:29:32,433 --> 01:29:35,209
But you Come back here immediately.

1223
01:29:36,170 --> 01:29:39,674
The intercepts between Jaffna
and Madras have been decoded.

1224
01:29:39,974 --> 01:29:42,420
There's There is a plot
to assassinate the ex-PM.

1225
01:29:42,643 --> 01:29:45,556
This is a serious threat
and we need to move fast.

1226
01:29:54,622 --> 01:29:56,602
You are drinking too much.

1227
01:29:57,058 --> 01:29:59,231
Are you okay?

1228
01:30:00,495 --> 01:30:01,940
You Go to sleep.

1229
01:30:02,797 --> 01:30:04,299
Don't worry about me.

1230
01:30:23,851 --> 01:30:24,852
Bala.

1231
01:30:25,853 --> 01:30:27,093
Why did you do this?

1232
01:30:28,356 --> 01:30:29,357
Why?

1233
01:30:30,258 --> 01:30:31,430
And my wife?

1234
01:30:32,193 --> 01:30:33,570
What was her fault?

1235
01:30:35,630 --> 01:30:37,507
It wasn't her fault.

1236
01:30:38,699 --> 01:30:40,178
That was a mistake.

1237
01:30:41,702 --> 01:30:43,113
You were the target,

1238
01:30:43,771 --> 01:30:45,580
but you survived.

1239
01:30:48,142 --> 01:30:49,917
You're lucky.

1240
01:30:52,046 --> 01:30:53,889
And the second arms deal?

1241
01:30:54,749 --> 01:30:55,853
My kidnapping?

1242
01:30:56,317 --> 01:30:57,591
You were behind it, Bala?

1243
01:31:19,540 --> 01:31:22,544
I have information that two
meetings took place in Singapore.

1244
01:31:23,277 --> 01:31:25,450
Where Rajsekharan represented Anna.

1245
01:31:25,580 --> 01:31:27,457
It's obviously
a well-designed plan.

1246
01:31:28,216 --> 01:31:30,162
Here's a copy of decoded
intercepts for you.

1247
01:31:30,351 --> 01:31:31,557
We've very little time.

1248
01:31:32,353 --> 01:31:33,661
Brief your best team.

1249
01:31:34,255 --> 01:31:36,394
Find out, where is it
this going to take place,

1250
01:31:36,457 --> 01:31:37,663
who all are involved?

1251
01:31:37,725 --> 01:31:40,205
Who? How? What? When? Where?

1252
01:31:40,595 --> 01:31:42,302
I need all the information.

1253
01:31:42,630 --> 01:31:43,904
And Vikram.. - Sir.

1254
01:31:44,499 --> 01:31:46,240
He is no longer the prime minister.

1255
01:31:46,367 --> 01:31:47,607
He's out of power.

1256
01:31:47,969 --> 01:31:49,573
It won't be so easy to operate.

1257
01:31:50,238 --> 01:31:51,410
Keep that in mind.

1258
01:31:51,506 --> 01:31:53,645
We need solid evidence.

1259
01:31:56,177 --> 01:31:57,247
Okay, guys-

1260
01:31:58,813 --> 01:32:00,224
Ghosh, first code.

1261
01:32:00,615 --> 01:32:01,992
Between Jaffna and London.

1262
01:32:02,049 --> 01:32:04,188
Anna is instructing Rajsekharan.

1263
01:32:07,088 --> 01:32:08,294
It has no meaning.

1264
01:32:08,456 --> 01:32:09,400
Gibberish, right?

1265
01:32:09,457 --> 01:32:11,937
But if we reverse these words..

1266
01:32:12,026 --> 01:32:13,528
Tamil words, sir.

1267
01:32:16,330 --> 01:32:18,037
And Their English translation:

1268
01:32:18,332 --> 01:32:19,538
Tooth.

1269
01:32:19,700 --> 01:32:21,202
Ant.

1270
01:32:21,369 --> 01:32:22,575
Lizard.

1271
01:32:22,637 --> 01:32:24,139
Kangaroo.

1272
01:32:24,338 --> 01:32:28,411
First letter of each word,
TALK, talk.

1273
01:32:29,010 --> 01:32:32,150
This is how we decoded
all the intercepts and we got..

1274
01:32:32,947 --> 01:32:37,123
Talk foreign friend,
mutually beneficial deal.

1275
01:32:37,285 --> 01:32:38,355
From where was this generated?

1276
01:32:38,419 --> 01:32:40,592
Jaffna to London.
Anna and Rajsekharan.

1277
01:32:40,655 --> 01:32:42,100
Second code, quick. - Right.

1278
01:32:42,156 --> 01:32:43,658
Don't leave home.

1279
01:32:43,724 --> 01:32:46,364
We need to garland
an important prince.

1280
01:32:46,661 --> 01:32:48,265
Here, home means Madras.

1281
01:32:48,396 --> 01:32:52,845
And important prince, what
we guess, is our ex-prime minister.

1282
01:32:53,267 --> 01:32:54,837
From Jaffna to Madras.

1283
01:32:55,002 --> 01:32:56,811
In Jaffna we can
hear - Anna and Pandyan.

1284
01:32:57,038 --> 01:32:59,040
In Madras - The call
was made to a PCO in Madras.

1285
01:32:59,373 --> 01:33:01,011
We still haven't been
able to track the receiver.

1286
01:33:01,075 --> 01:33:02,315
But we're on it.

1287
01:33:02,376 --> 01:33:03,821
Activate Saba in Jaffna.

1288
01:33:03,978 --> 01:33:06,117
Rishi, you take charge
of the South. - Right, sir.

1289
01:33:12,486 --> 01:33:13,760
Saba here, sir.

1290
01:33:14,555 --> 01:33:15,932
I've found an important link.

1291
01:33:16,223 --> 01:33:18,203
You sure about the link? Will
he provide us with information?

1292
01:33:18,459 --> 01:33:19,870
What if like last time"

1293
01:33:19,994 --> 01:33:21,598
No, sir. He's agreed to talk.

1294
01:33:21,796 --> 01:33:23,036
Okay. Where?

1295
01:33:23,731 --> 01:33:26,507
Sir, you'll have to come to Jaffna.

1296
01:33:27,268 --> 01:33:28,269
Jaffna?

1297
01:33:29,503 --> 01:33:30,709
Okay. Keep him on surveillance

1298
01:33:31,172 --> 01:33:32,173
I'll be there by tomorrow.

1299
01:33:41,515 --> 01:33:43,188
His name is Selvam...

1300
01:33:44,051 --> 01:33:46,429
Go on. - He's scared, sir.

1301
01:33:46,821 --> 01:33:48,596
He hasn't left his
home since 15 days.

1302
01:33:48,856 --> 01:33:50,233
LTF is looking for him.

1303
01:33:51,592 --> 01:33:53,435
He was a part of the hit squad.

1304
01:33:53,728 --> 01:33:55,366
But he doesn't wish to die.

1305
01:33:56,063 --> 01:33:57,565
He said he doesn't
want to be a martyr.

1306
01:34:11,145 --> 01:34:13,955
Come. Sir.
- You promised me you will save me

1307
01:34:14,015 --> 01:34:15,016
Come on.

1308
01:34:18,352 --> 01:34:19,990
Speak up. What do you know?

1309
01:34:20,154 --> 01:34:23,033
I don't want to die.

1310
01:34:23,324 --> 01:34:26,134
Sir, I want to get out of Jaffna.

1311
01:34:26,394 --> 01:34:28,271
Sir, you promised
me you will save me.

1312
01:34:28,362 --> 01:34:29,739
Listen to what he is saying

1313
01:34:30,498 --> 01:34:33,536
What happened?
Why did you run away?

1314
01:34:34,168 --> 01:34:36,409
They said we will attack.

1315
01:34:37,171 --> 01:34:39,651
I didn't join the
movement for that.

1316
01:34:39,974 --> 01:34:40,975
Then?

1317
01:34:41,208 --> 01:34:44,985
People were selected and trained.

1318
01:34:53,854 --> 01:34:55,356
How many?

1319
01:34:55,656 --> 01:35:00,036
Six different teams
for different cities.

1320
01:35:00,227 --> 01:35:03,140
Each team consisted of five people.

1321
01:35:06,300 --> 01:35:07,301
Where are they?

1322
01:35:07,435 --> 01:35:08,778
I don't know.

1323
01:35:09,236 --> 01:35:10,476
They Left from the camp.

1324
01:35:26,387 --> 01:35:27,991
Did they tell you
who the target is?

1325
01:35:28,456 --> 01:35:29,526
I don't know, sir.

1326
01:35:29,590 --> 01:35:31,934
Sir! -You are lying.

1327
01:35:32,359 --> 01:35:37,638
They will kill me.
You said you would save me.

1328
01:35:37,732 --> 01:35:39,006
He says LTF will kill him.

1329
01:35:39,066 --> 01:35:41,342
Sir, save me sir..

1330
01:35:44,438 --> 01:35:45,542
How many people does
each hit squad contain?

1331
01:35:45,673 --> 01:35:49,780
Each contains 4 or 5 people.
6-7 different teams.

1332
01:35:50,377 --> 01:35:51,879
They left Jaffna a week back.

1333
01:35:52,279 --> 01:35:53,189
Where to?

1334
01:35:53,247 --> 01:35:54,521
We don't know.

1335
01:35:55,449 --> 01:35:56,553
Multiple cities.

1336
01:35:56,751 --> 01:35:59,129
But one team has definitely
landed in Tamil Nadu.

1337
01:35:59,687 --> 01:36:03,100
Okay, sir. - 'He has started south
election campaign for South from today.'

1338
01:36:03,290 --> 01:36:06,032
'And he said that Tamil
cause will be his priority.'

1339
01:36:06,360 --> 01:36:08,362
'And he assured the people that.'
- It's code red.

1340
01:36:09,163 --> 01:36:10,233
Issue high alert.

1341
01:36:10,631 --> 01:36:12,167
Ask them to seal the coastline.

1342
01:36:12,633 --> 01:36:15,341
Inform the naval intel
and the coastguards.

1343
01:36:15,836 --> 01:36:18,942
Ask them to hit any suspicious
activity in the sea.

1344
01:36:19,306 --> 01:36:20,808
Green light to tower one

1345
01:36:20,908 --> 01:36:22,251
Confirm location.

1346
01:36:22,343 --> 01:36:24,323
Four knots enemy suspect

1347
01:36:24,512 --> 01:36:25,786
Three fishermen boats.

1348
01:36:25,846 --> 01:36:27,416
Investigate. Over.

1349
01:36:29,350 --> 01:36:30,522
And crack down.

1350
01:36:30,584 --> 01:36:35,124
Let's go. - Capture every
known LTF person, sympathizer.

1351
01:36:35,256 --> 01:36:37,668
Those who have surrendered.
Everyone.

1352
01:36:37,758 --> 01:36:39,931
Get on to each damn one of them.

1353
01:36:40,394 --> 01:36:41,395
N ow.

1354
01:36:48,035 --> 01:36:50,379
'Today morning, in different
parts of South lndia..'

1355
01:36:50,571 --> 01:36:51,572
Get them in the car.

1356
01:36:51,639 --> 01:36:54,279
'..The local police
and security agencies...

1357
01:36:54,375 --> 01:36:59,654
'..took around 5O suspected
LTF rebels into custody.'

1358
01:36:59,880 --> 01:37:01,621
'It's believed that...

1359
01:37:01,715 --> 01:37:05,754
...the reason behind this
is the forthcoming elections.'

1360
01:37:26,841 --> 01:37:28,252
Come on, backseat. - Get in!

1361
01:37:28,409 --> 01:37:30,787
Sir, did you get
the photographs? - Yes.

1362
01:37:30,845 --> 01:37:33,155
He's This is Kanda.
LTF's sympathizers.

1363
01:37:33,214 --> 01:37:36,491
He's He is the one who received
Anna's second code from Jaffna.

1364
01:37:37,451 --> 01:37:38,725
But He's missing as of now.

1365
01:37:38,786 --> 01:37:39,560
And about the other one?

1366
01:37:39,620 --> 01:37:41,566
The one in on the
right is Kanankanan.

1367
01:37:41,789 --> 01:37:44,065
We caught him during the crackdown.
He's in Madurai jail.

1368
01:37:44,191 --> 01:37:45,864
We can get some
information from him.

1369
01:38:08,515 --> 01:38:09,755
When did you come to India?

1370
01:38:10,751 --> 01:38:12,196
Six months back.

1371
01:38:12,620 --> 01:38:13,792
He's Kanda.

1372
01:38:13,954 --> 01:38:15,297
How do you know him?

1373
01:38:15,556 --> 01:38:19,129
Sir, He's he is LTF's
local contact here.

1374
01:38:19,760 --> 01:38:21,671
He provides legal help to refugees.

1375
01:38:22,496 --> 01:38:24,442
Passport, ration card.

1376
01:38:25,165 --> 01:38:26,508
He gave helped me one too.

1377
01:38:26,967 --> 01:38:28,446
I've been working
for him since then.

1378
01:38:28,702 --> 01:38:29,840
Where is Kanda now?

1379
01:38:29,970 --> 01:38:31,972
I don't know, sir.
Since I'm I have been in prison.

1380
01:38:32,139 --> 01:38:34,016
Lying? - No, sir.

1381
01:38:34,441 --> 01:38:36,546
One of LTF's seniors
came here some time ago.

1382
01:38:36,710 --> 01:38:38,451
Yes, Rajsekharan.

1383
01:38:38,913 --> 01:38:40,654
He came by a boat? From Jaffna?

1384
01:38:40,748 --> 01:38:44,321
No, sir. I and Kanda sir and
I picked him up from the airport.

1385
01:38:44,652 --> 01:38:45,960
Where was he coming from?

1386
01:38:46,320 --> 01:38:47,424
London.

1387
01:38:47,655 --> 01:38:48,929
Then what happened?

1388
01:38:50,858 --> 01:38:52,360
I'll set you up here
for the lifetime make...

1389
01:38:52,426 --> 01:38:54,201
...this your permanent
residence. Got it?

1390
01:38:58,065 --> 01:39:02,514
After he came here they
had a discussion at the farmhouse.

1391
01:39:02,970 --> 01:39:04,415
A discussion about
some assassination.

1392
01:39:04,505 --> 01:39:05,848
Whose assassination?

1393
01:39:05,973 --> 01:39:07,145
I don't know.

1394
01:39:07,308 --> 01:39:10,482
But Rajsekharan was
very angry that night.

1395
01:39:10,611 --> 01:39:13,683
Kanda sir asked me
to leave after that.

1396
01:39:18,185 --> 01:39:22,190
Then you know about the LTF groups
that came here a few days ago.

1397
01:39:23,023 --> 01:39:24,127
What do you know about it?

1398
01:39:24,224 --> 01:39:27,501
I was instructed
to pick up the refugees.

1399
01:39:40,174 --> 01:39:42,415
I thought they
are regular refugees.

1400
01:39:42,643 --> 01:39:46,819
But this time Kanda sir
personally received them.

1401
01:39:59,126 --> 01:40:00,571
Do you know them?

1402
01:40:01,028 --> 01:40:02,564
They weren't refugees.

1403
01:40:02,663 --> 01:40:04,574
They looked different.

1404
01:40:04,798 --> 01:40:06,141
Where did you drop them?

1405
01:40:06,867 --> 01:40:07,937
Beach road.

1406
01:40:08,569 --> 01:40:09,843
House No. 33.

1407
01:40:10,037 --> 01:40:11,072
Where are they now?

1408
01:40:11,238 --> 01:40:12,512
I don't know.

1409
01:40:16,977 --> 01:40:18,217
Hello, Vikram? It's Jaya.

1410
01:40:18,445 --> 01:40:21,255
Rajsekharan was traced in London.

1411
01:40:21,682 --> 01:40:24,458
He holds four to five passports
under different names.

1412
01:40:24,852 --> 01:40:27,924
So in London, he did have
a crucial meeting in Madras café.

1413
01:40:28,255 --> 01:40:31,031
And there were others with him.
- Who all?

1414
01:40:31,191 --> 01:40:32,261
No idea.

1415
01:40:32,393 --> 01:40:34,430
But I actually called
for something else.

1416
01:40:34,495 --> 01:40:37,704
It's really, really important
and you need to know this.

1417
01:40:37,965 --> 01:40:39,808
But I can't tell
you over the phone.

1418
01:40:39,867 --> 01:40:41,278
Fax? - No.

1419
01:40:41,335 --> 01:40:43,008
I need to see you in person.

1420
01:40:43,070 --> 01:40:45,277
I'm coming to New Delhi, day after.

1421
01:40:45,372 --> 01:40:46,783
We'll meet day after tomorrow.

1422
01:40:46,840 --> 01:40:48,615
Hotel Imperial, at 9:00pm.

1423
01:41:19,807 --> 01:41:21,184
Good evening, sir. - Good evening.

1424
01:41:21,241 --> 01:41:23,050
A few people came
here some days ago.

1425
01:41:23,210 --> 01:41:24,951
How many? - 2-3 people.

1426
01:41:25,045 --> 01:41:27,025
They bought a lot
of industrial chemicals.

1427
01:41:27,081 --> 01:41:28,958
Something normal people
usually don't buy.

1428
01:41:29,083 --> 01:41:30,994
From where had they come?
- I don't know.

1429
01:41:31,218 --> 01:41:32,424
But they weren't locals.

1430
01:41:32,820 --> 01:41:34,629
Let me know if you
find anything else.

1431
01:41:34,888 --> 01:41:36,231
Okay, sir.

1432
01:41:37,391 --> 01:41:40,565
Exile Rama coming home,
lets celebrate Deepavali

1433
01:41:40,661 --> 01:41:42,072
Sorry, sir, for calling this late.

1434
01:41:42,162 --> 01:41:44,073
But we've intercepted
another wireless.

1435
01:41:44,164 --> 01:41:45,666
Between Jaffna and Madras.

1436
01:41:45,833 --> 01:41:46,834
What is it?

1437
01:41:47,201 --> 01:41:48,703
Sir, it goes something like this.

1438
01:41:48,802 --> 01:41:50,577
Celebrate Diwali Ex-PM..

1439
01:41:50,704 --> 01:41:52,206
Diwali.. Ex-PM..

1440
01:41:52,840 --> 01:41:54,114
EX-PM..

1441
01:41:54,875 --> 01:41:56,445
Anything unusual?
- I don't know, sir.

1442
01:41:56,510 --> 01:41:59,252
Perhaps they are
reconfirming the target.

1443
01:41:59,313 --> 01:42:01,315
Okay. Find out.
Keep me informed. - Right, sir.

1444
01:42:01,615 --> 01:42:03,595
When do you think
we can have the delivery

1445
01:42:03,984 --> 01:42:05,861
My contact will
get in touch with you

1446
01:42:06,153 --> 01:42:08,394
What did you find, Arjun?
- Sir, check this.

1447
01:42:09,957 --> 01:42:12,335
Whose call is it?
- Vijayan. Vijayan Joseph.

1448
01:42:15,829 --> 01:42:17,502
Hello, sir. -Yes, Rishi?

1449
01:42:18,098 --> 01:42:19,668
Sir, we've traced Vijayan's call.

1450
01:42:19,833 --> 01:42:21,540
From where? - What's the source?

1451
01:42:21,702 --> 01:42:22,908
Street one. Maduria. Mylapore

1452
01:42:23,070 --> 01:42:24,174
MWapore

1453
01:42:24,238 --> 01:42:25,478
Connect to Delhi. - Yeah.

1454
01:42:25,639 --> 01:42:27,346
Connect Madras. - Right, sir.

1455
01:42:28,742 --> 01:42:29,743
Delhi connected, sir.

1456
01:42:29,810 --> 01:42:30,845
Sir, Delhi connected.

1457
01:42:30,944 --> 01:42:31,649
Give me the details.

1458
01:42:31,712 --> 01:42:32,850
Sir, Madras connected.

1459
01:42:32,946 --> 01:42:34,220
Sir, picking up and delivery.

1460
01:42:34,281 --> 01:42:35,885
Sir, they are talking
about some delivery.

1461
01:42:35,983 --> 01:42:37,462
Call has been traced to?
- Jaffna, sir.

1462
01:42:37,551 --> 01:42:38,894
Call has been traced
to Jaffna, sir.

1463
01:42:38,952 --> 01:42:40,954
Sir, Vijayan is the
one who came from Germany.

1464
01:42:41,021 --> 01:42:42,466
He's a bombmaker.

1465
01:42:44,458 --> 01:42:45,903
Number tracked, sir.

1466
01:42:46,660 --> 01:42:48,503
Fine. I'll be there by tomorrow.
- Okay, sir.

1467
01:43:09,883 --> 01:43:13,023
That's Rajsekharan,
at Madras Café, London.

1468
01:43:15,189 --> 01:43:16,259
Look at this.

1469
01:43:16,723 --> 01:43:18,794
I couldn't share this
with you over the phone.

1470
01:43:20,928 --> 01:43:22,407
I don't think there's much time.

1471
01:43:23,830 --> 01:43:27,334
Four days back, this amount was
transferred into the LTF account.

1472
01:43:27,668 --> 01:43:29,739
This means this is
the final confirmation?

1473
01:43:30,170 --> 01:43:31,274
For anyjob,

1474
01:43:32,139 --> 01:43:33,880
money is the final confirmation.

1475
01:43:34,074 --> 01:43:35,417
Where did you get this from?

1476
01:43:36,009 --> 01:43:37,716
I was investigating these banks.

1477
01:43:37,911 --> 01:43:41,415
And realized such banks
only exist on paper.

1478
01:43:41,848 --> 01:43:45,193
They remain for a few days,
months and then,

1479
01:43:45,619 --> 01:43:47,064
theyjust disappear.

1480
01:43:47,554 --> 01:43:49,966
So, first the speech by the ex-PM.

1481
01:43:51,425 --> 01:43:54,031
Then Rajsekharan goes
to Madras Café, London.

1482
01:43:55,028 --> 01:43:56,769
And that's where
possibly things happened.

1483
01:43:57,397 --> 01:43:59,877
'Anna, he's coming back to power.'

1484
01:44:00,834 --> 01:44:02,905
'He will not let
us do what we want.'

1485
01:44:03,570 --> 01:44:05,243
'He'll demand a
political solution.'

1486
01:44:05,405 --> 01:44:06,816
Now we will only have to act

1487
01:44:08,108 --> 01:44:09,849
Does anyone else
know that you are here?

1488
01:44:11,645 --> 01:44:12,646
No.

1489
01:44:18,919 --> 01:44:21,593
Abuda - Does the jacket fit well?

1490
01:44:21,955 --> 01:44:22,899
Hope its not too tight?

1491
01:44:22,956 --> 01:44:24,162
No, its fine

1492
01:44:24,358 --> 01:44:25,393
Okay. Okay.

1493
01:44:25,592 --> 01:44:27,572
Then we'll do the
rehearsal tonight.

1494
01:44:27,828 --> 01:44:29,034
Okay? - Okay.

1495
01:44:39,206 --> 01:44:40,378
O kay, J aya.

1496
01:44:41,675 --> 01:44:44,246
So, what'll you do now, Vikram?

1497
01:44:44,745 --> 01:44:45,917
I don't know.

1498
01:44:46,947 --> 01:44:48,290
Be careful, Vikram.

1499
01:44:48,882 --> 01:44:51,294
'Please proceed to Gate No. 3.'

1500
01:44:51,385 --> 01:44:53,831
'Security check begins
in ten minutes.'

1501
01:44:55,289 --> 01:44:57,701
'This is the final boarding
call for passengers of...

1502
01:44:57,824 --> 01:45:00,430
Flight No. 3728 to Kansas City.'

1503
01:45:00,627 --> 01:45:03,005
'Please proceed to Gate No.
3 immediately.'

1504
01:45:03,096 --> 01:45:05,440
'Security check will
begin in awhile.'

1505
01:45:35,395 --> 01:45:36,965
Hands up! Don't move

1506
01:45:38,632 --> 01:45:40,009
Catch him!

1507
01:45:44,204 --> 01:45:46,445
Hands up!
Don't move! Stay down; stay down

1508
01:45:46,540 --> 01:45:47,814
Sir, please! - Relax!

1509
01:45:47,874 --> 01:45:49,820
Sir, I'm not involved.

1510
01:45:54,815 --> 01:45:56,158
Go and check everywhere.
- Yes, sir.

1511
01:45:56,350 --> 01:45:57,556
Check outside. - Come on.

1512
01:45:57,617 --> 01:45:58,994
Go! - Come on!

1513
01:46:02,322 --> 01:46:03,562
What were you thinking?

1514
01:46:03,990 --> 01:46:07,437
You'll make bombs here and your
family will stay safe in Germany?

1515
01:46:08,628 --> 01:46:10,437
This is your wife
and daughter, right?

1516
01:46:11,765 --> 01:46:13,176
Do you wish to see them alive?

1517
01:46:13,400 --> 01:46:16,142
Please, sir, do them no harm.

1518
01:46:16,603 --> 01:46:18,276
They are innocent.

1519
01:46:18,438 --> 01:46:20,145
What about the
people who live here?

1520
01:46:21,208 --> 01:46:22,312
What about them?

1521
01:46:22,542 --> 01:46:24,249
Whom did you supply
the explosives to?

1522
01:46:24,578 --> 01:46:26,956
I was hired.

1523
01:46:27,514 --> 01:46:29,653
Iwas told I'll be paid well, sir.

1524
01:46:30,016 --> 01:46:31,290
I'm not a terrorist, sir.

1525
01:46:31,551 --> 01:46:32,996
I'm a chemical engineer.

1526
01:46:33,453 --> 01:46:35,524
I used to work in Germany.

1527
01:46:36,022 --> 01:46:39,060
I tested the explosives in Germany.

1528
01:46:40,727 --> 01:46:42,638
I came to India three months ago.

1529
01:46:42,963 --> 01:46:45,273
They supplied me
with the raw materials.

1530
01:46:45,565 --> 01:46:47,738
Ijust assembled it.
That's all, sir.

1531
01:46:47,868 --> 01:46:49,176
What did you assemble?

1532
01:46:50,971 --> 01:46:52,348
Plastic explosives.

1533
01:46:53,407 --> 01:46:54,977
First time in the world.

1534
01:46:55,375 --> 01:46:56,820
High quality explosives.

1535
01:46:57,344 --> 01:46:58,982
Rubber like material.

1536
01:46:59,146 --> 01:47:04,027
Advantage is that the metal
detectives can't detect it.

1537
01:47:17,030 --> 01:47:22,571
And kills it can kill everyone
anyone in the radius of 20-30 feet.

1538
01:47:23,437 --> 01:47:25,212
Where are they taking it?

1539
01:47:25,739 --> 01:47:27,776
How will they use it?
- I don't know, sir.

1540
01:47:28,508 --> 01:47:30,317
It can happen anywhere

1541
01:47:30,610 --> 01:47:34,717
Delhi, Bombay, Madras. Anywhere.

1542
01:47:34,948 --> 01:47:36,052
When will they hit?

1543
01:47:36,383 --> 01:47:37,453
I don't know, sir.

1544
01:47:38,018 --> 01:47:39,554
While we are speaking, sir..

1545
01:47:44,724 --> 01:47:47,102
Can it be deactivated from here?
Somehow..

1546
01:47:47,594 --> 01:47:49,198
All the bombs? No. Not possible.

1547
01:47:50,063 --> 01:47:51,736
But my family, sir..

1548
01:48:17,524 --> 01:48:19,902
Ghosh, the third intercept?
- Deepti?

1549
01:48:19,960 --> 01:48:22,702
Celebrate Diwali,
Exile Rama, coming home.

1550
01:48:22,963 --> 01:48:24,636
Get ex-PM's rally schedule. Quick.

1551
01:48:24,831 --> 01:48:26,139
Right here, sir.

1552
01:48:39,980 --> 01:48:41,152
Excuse me, sir.

1553
01:48:41,515 --> 01:48:43,153
There's a technical
problem in the flight.

1554
01:48:43,216 --> 01:48:44,354
It'll take a bit longer.

1555
01:48:44,451 --> 01:48:46,624
How long? - About an hour.

1556
01:48:46,853 --> 01:48:47,854
Okay.

1557
01:48:48,788 --> 01:48:52,133
Sir, this last intercept
is between Jaffna and Madras.

1558
01:48:52,526 --> 01:48:56,303
Celebrate Diwali,
Exile Rama, coming home.

1559
01:48:56,663 --> 01:48:58,540
Sir, it has been decoded.

1560
01:48:59,065 --> 01:49:00,510
Exile - Ex.

1561
01:49:00,667 --> 01:49:02,078
Rama -- PM

1562
01:49:02,202 --> 01:49:03,272
EX-PM.

1563
01:49:03,670 --> 01:49:06,514
His today's rally schedule.

1564
01:49:06,873 --> 01:49:08,147
10am. - Warrangal.

1565
01:49:08,275 --> 01:49:09,948
1:30pm. - Vijaywada.

1566
01:49:10,176 --> 01:49:11,519
4:00pm. - Hyderabad.

1567
01:49:11,678 --> 01:49:14,158
And 10:00pm Poothiyaddur.

1568
01:49:19,119 --> 01:49:21,759
What I want to say is, ex-PM.

1569
01:49:22,088 --> 01:49:26,298
X in roman is ten.

1570
01:49:27,027 --> 01:49:28,734
10:00pm.

1571
01:49:29,396 --> 01:49:31,899
Ex-PM. 10:00pm.

1572
01:49:32,632 --> 01:49:34,509
Poothiyaddur, 10:00pm.

1573
01:49:34,701 --> 01:49:38,205
You mean they are striking tonight?

1574
01:49:38,605 --> 01:49:39,606
Ithink so, sir.

1575
01:49:39,673 --> 01:49:42,449
Where is he right now?
- Hyderabad airport lounge, sir.

1576
01:50:04,598 --> 01:50:05,599
Oh God!

1577
01:50:06,833 --> 01:50:08,210
We can't take a chance.

1578
01:50:08,468 --> 01:50:09,879
We're already late.

1579
01:50:16,209 --> 01:50:17,745
We'll have to stop him. - Sir.

1580
01:50:18,044 --> 01:50:20,456
Get me Hyderabad airport. - Sir.

1581
01:50:32,258 --> 01:50:37,537
All our intels are clearing stating
that LTF will target the ex-PM.

1582
01:50:37,864 --> 01:50:39,309
We've strong evidence.

1583
01:50:39,399 --> 01:50:41,777
First back switch,
then front switch.

1584
01:50:46,106 --> 01:50:47,881
First back switch,

1585
01:50:48,642 --> 01:50:50,053
then front switch.

1586
01:50:50,110 --> 01:50:51,248
Once more.

1587
01:50:51,778 --> 01:50:55,851
State governor went against
protocol and warned him.

1588
01:50:55,915 --> 01:50:57,417
That he shouldn't tour south.

1589
01:50:57,484 --> 01:51:02,991
No, I don't think LTF will
plan something this big. No.

1590
01:51:07,027 --> 01:51:08,870
First back switch,

1591
01:51:09,963 --> 01:51:11,601
then front switch.

1592
01:51:15,835 --> 01:51:20,215
We'll have to provide him
with full protection, at all cost.

1593
01:51:20,273 --> 01:51:24,813
Ex-PM or ex-minister,
we cannot provide NSG to anyone.

1594
01:51:24,878 --> 01:51:27,188
It is against the rules!
We cannot do it!

1595
01:51:27,247 --> 01:51:31,559
But if you insist,
keeping in mind the threat.

1596
01:51:31,618 --> 01:51:34,656
...we'll inform the state police.
They will look after it.

1597
01:51:34,821 --> 01:51:37,199
Fine. Whatever you deem fit.

1598
01:51:52,472 --> 01:51:53,177
Ghosh.. - Sir.

1599
01:51:53,239 --> 01:51:55,219
Get me special access.
I'm about to reach the airport.

1600
01:51:55,275 --> 01:51:56,481
Now. - Okay, sir.

1601
01:52:06,986 --> 01:52:08,966
Good afternoon, sir. Robin Dutt.

1602
01:52:09,289 --> 01:52:10,768
I've a request to make, sir.

1603
01:52:11,091 --> 01:52:16,040
Kindly cancel your rallies for
today and for the next 2-3 days.

1604
01:52:16,796 --> 01:52:19,504
There's a threat. It will
be better if you avoid them.

1605
01:52:19,599 --> 01:52:23,513
You know I want to be with
the people for these elections.

1606
01:52:23,870 --> 01:52:25,372
There is security over there.

1607
01:52:25,438 --> 01:52:28,180
Yes, sir. It's there.
But it could be dangerous.

1608
01:52:28,408 --> 01:52:30,581
It's a request.
Please don't go there.

1609
01:52:31,144 --> 01:52:32,282
Sir, excuse me.

1610
01:52:32,979 --> 01:52:35,289
Pilotjust informed. Flight
is ready for take off. - Okay.

1611
01:52:37,016 --> 01:52:41,021
Robin, please don't worry.
I'll be fine. Okay?

1612
01:53:14,354 --> 01:53:16,163
He will be reaching
in ten minutes...

1613
01:53:24,330 --> 01:53:26,776
Everyone please co-operate
for the security check...

1614
01:53:26,833 --> 01:53:30,007
Please move behind
from the stage...

1615
01:53:30,336 --> 01:53:33,715
Ladies who will be garlanding,
please move to the front row

1616
01:53:38,711 --> 01:53:40,315
Please maintain discipline...

1617
01:53:40,380 --> 01:53:43,384
...our leader will be
reaching in the next minutes

1618
01:53:47,387 --> 01:53:49,833
Sir, here's the route map.
Rishi is already there.

1619
01:53:50,089 --> 01:53:51,090
Okay.

1620
01:53:57,797 --> 01:54:00,573
Vikram has reached.
He's on his way to the rally.

1621
01:54:00,934 --> 01:54:02,345
All units informed.

1622
01:54:03,036 --> 01:54:04,481
Routine scanning is complete, sir.

1623
01:54:04,604 --> 01:54:06,277
Around 3000-3500 people.

1624
01:54:06,472 --> 01:54:07,644
He'll be here soon.

1625
01:54:07,740 --> 01:54:09,549
Keep checking, I'm coming.
- Yes, sir.

1626
01:54:47,313 --> 01:54:49,452
Ex-PM has reached.

1627
01:56:15,835 --> 01:56:17,872
You're not allowed to go ahead!

1628
01:58:14,053 --> 01:58:18,593
'We're sorry to inform
you that earlier tonight..'

1629
01:58:18,858 --> 01:58:22,567
'..lndia's former Prime
Minister was assassinated.'

1630
01:58:24,230 --> 01:58:27,143
'This dreadful blast
took place at 10:10pm.'

1631
01:58:27,567 --> 01:58:29,706
'He was in Poothiyaddur
district in South India,

1632
01:58:29,802 --> 01:58:32,146
to address an election rally.'

1633
01:58:32,305 --> 01:58:36,014
'In the south of India,
this sudden and tragic death..'

1634
01:58:36,075 --> 01:58:38,521
'..has left the whole
nation in a state of shock.'

1635
01:58:38,978 --> 01:58:43,427
'This is the first time
a human bomb has been used...'

1636
01:58:43,749 --> 01:58:47,959
'His unfortunate death has
left people in a state of shock.'

1637
01:58:48,087 --> 01:58:50,294
'The whole nation is mourning.'

1638
01:58:50,656 --> 01:58:53,694
'So far this blast has
claimed 25 people's lives,

1639
01:58:53,793 --> 01:58:55,670
and injured more than 100 people.'

1640
01:58:56,062 --> 01:58:58,565
'A horrific blast
took place at 10:10pm.'

1641
01:58:58,631 --> 01:59:02,238
'This shocking incident has sent
shock waves across the entire nation.'

1642
01:59:02,368 --> 01:59:04,245
'Bringing the country
to a complete standstill.'

1643
01:59:04,303 --> 01:59:06,544
'The special investigation
squad has revealed..'

1644
01:59:06,739 --> 01:59:09,117
'..the use of plastic
explosives and RDX.'

1645
01:59:09,375 --> 01:59:12,254
'So far this blast has
claimed 25 people's lives,

1646
01:59:12,411 --> 01:59:14,186
and injured more than 100 people.'

1647
01:59:14,547 --> 01:59:17,153
They were those who
came to the rally...

1648
01:59:17,216 --> 01:59:18,923
...to support our
former prime minister.

1649
01:59:19,852 --> 01:59:20,956
Just like that.

1650
01:59:22,155 --> 01:59:23,759
What was his fault?

1651
01:59:24,991 --> 01:59:26,595
He was so young.

1652
01:59:26,959 --> 01:59:27,960
We tried.

1653
01:59:29,162 --> 01:59:32,871
But we lost. - 'President
has requested people to stay calm.'

1654
01:59:33,032 --> 01:59:36,172
'Leaders all across the world
have expressed their condolences.'

1655
01:59:45,344 --> 01:59:48,484
'After some time..' - Let's go!
Let's go! Let's go!

1656
01:59:49,248 --> 01:59:52,388
'The investigation team
arrested a few suspects.'

1657
01:59:53,653 --> 01:59:56,998
'And a few suspects committed
suicide before they could be arrested.'

1658
02:00:11,370 --> 02:00:14,817
'And I submitted my report
to the special investigation team.'

1659
02:00:20,780 --> 02:00:23,522
This commission appreciates
your investigations.

1660
02:00:23,883 --> 02:00:25,590
And yes, we will consider them.

1661
02:00:25,651 --> 02:00:29,189
But, Mr.
Vikram, we need solid evidence.

1662
02:00:29,989 --> 02:00:31,400
'I'd never realized that...

1663
02:00:31,457 --> 02:00:33,903
...the world is so threatened
by our Prime Minister.'

1664
02:00:36,796 --> 02:00:39,174
'RD sir resigned after a few days.'

1665
02:00:43,102 --> 02:00:45,480
I hope you've given this
decision of yours a thought.

1666
02:00:47,707 --> 02:00:48,708
Yes.

1667
02:00:55,748 --> 02:01:00,356
And I took a voluntary
retirement and came here.

1668
02:01:00,786 --> 02:01:04,996
Whatever you just said
could also be just a coincidence.

1669
02:01:05,891 --> 02:01:07,199
No, Father.

1670
02:01:07,393 --> 02:01:12,934
This conspiracy was played
out just as it was planned.

1671
02:01:14,100 --> 02:01:15,204
And I was late.

1672
02:01:18,004 --> 02:01:19,881
But I couldn't compete with him.

1673
02:01:21,173 --> 02:01:22,777
They were powerful.

1674
02:01:24,243 --> 02:01:26,849
And In this game we
lost our Prime Minister.

1675
02:01:28,080 --> 02:01:30,321
And the Lankan Tamils
- their future.

1676
02:01:31,917 --> 02:01:32,918
Then who won?

1677
02:01:33,452 --> 02:01:34,624
I don't know.

1678
02:01:35,988 --> 02:01:37,433
Perhaps it was everyone's loss.

1679
02:01:39,058 --> 02:01:40,059
And Anna?

1680
02:01:41,994 --> 02:01:45,271
One man's revolutionary
is another man's terrorist.

1681
02:01:46,632 --> 02:01:49,169
Anna is revolutionary
for his people.

1682
02:01:51,370 --> 02:01:53,077
But I lost my Prime Minister.

1683
02:01:54,073 --> 02:01:55,347
What will you do now?

1684
02:01:59,312 --> 02:02:01,155
Ruby's father gave this to me...

1685
02:02:02,782 --> 02:02:04,523
...on our wedding day.

1686
02:02:05,051 --> 02:02:06,325
A wedding gift.

1687
02:02:09,955 --> 02:02:14,631
Where the mind is without
fear and the head is held high..

1688
02:02:15,828 --> 02:02:17,466
Where knowledge is free..

1689
02:02:19,465 --> 02:02:23,743
Where the world has not
been broken up into fragments.

1690
02:02:24,670 --> 02:02:26,741
By narrow domestic walls..

1691
02:02:28,007 --> 02:02:30,544
Where words come out
from the depth of truth"

1692
02:02:31,844 --> 02:02:35,348
Where tireless striving stretches
its arms towards pen'ection..

1693
02:02:36,982 --> 02:02:39,826
Where the clear stream
of reason has not lost its way..

1694
02:02:40,986 --> 02:02:43,296
Into the dreary desert
sand of dead habit.

1695
02:02:44,023 --> 02:02:46,367
Where the mind is
led fonlvard by thee..

1696
02:02:46,859 --> 02:02:49,169
Into every-widening
thought and action"

1697
02:02:50,529 --> 02:02:53,066
Into that heaven of freedom,
my Father,

1698
02:02:54,066 --> 02:02:55,409
let my country awake..

1699
02:02:55,468 --> 02:02:56,469
Thank you.
