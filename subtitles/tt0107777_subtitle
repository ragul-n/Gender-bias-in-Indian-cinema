1
00:00:25,072 --> 00:00:28,633
This is that battleground
whose thirst..

2
00:00:28,709 --> 00:00:31,974
..is quenched only with blood.

3
00:00:34,648 --> 00:00:37,378
This is Thakur Bhavani Singh ..

4
00:00:40,087 --> 00:00:43,147
..and he is the Chief of gypsies,
Raja Bahadur.

5
00:00:45,225 --> 00:00:51,789
Whenever there is a conflict,
it is decided by a battle.

6
00:00:53,066 --> 00:00:56,194
both the brave men confront
each other.

7
00:00:57,237 --> 00:01:01,173
Both have only one bullet
in their gun.

8
00:01:01,942 --> 00:01:08,609
This one bullet decides their
victory or defeat ..

9
00:01:08,682 --> 00:01:11,014
..life or death.

10
00:01:11,885 --> 00:01:17,289
That is the law here,
that is the tradition.

11
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:33,636
The earth is thirsting for..

12
00:01:33,707 --> 00:01:37,336
..blood of innocent men

13
00:01:37,878 --> 00:01:45,375
The earth is thirsting for
blood of innocent men

14
00:01:45,986 --> 00:01:49,649
This is not water..

15
00:01:49,723 --> 00:01:53,887
..this is the blood of humans

16
00:01:54,127 --> 00:01:58,063
lt is the human blood.

17
00:01:58,665 --> 00:02:06,834
The earth is thirsting for
blood of innocent men

18
00:02:12,145 --> 00:02:15,603
The colour is same for everyone

19
00:02:15,682 --> 00:02:18,879
There is no difference

20
00:02:19,186 --> 00:02:22,622
The colour is same for everyone

21
00:02:22,689 --> 00:02:26,955
There is no difference

22
00:02:27,227 --> 00:02:30,628
Try mixing and see..

23
00:02:30,697 --> 00:02:35,361
..your own and blood of others

24
00:02:35,635 --> 00:02:39,628
Your own blood and others' blood

25
00:02:39,973 --> 00:02:47,971
The earth is thirsting for
blood of innocent men

26
00:02:57,224 --> 00:03:00,660
Wonderful! no one can aim like that.

27
00:03:02,596 --> 00:03:05,588
Raghuveersingh-ji, one needs to
practice for 300-400 years..

28
00:03:05,665 --> 00:03:08,133
..to be able to aim like this.

29
00:03:09,769 --> 00:03:13,603
And l am not firing this
gun on my own, ..

30
00:03:13,673 --> 00:03:16,801
..l have my ancestors'
blessings with me.

31
00:03:20,614 --> 00:03:24,106
- What are you doing here, son?
- Why did you stop? Fire!

32
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:28,110
Come here, son.

33
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:34,788
- He's my son, Prithvi, he's just
come from London. - Hello!

34
00:03:35,629 --> 00:03:39,963
l may miss my target sometimes,
but he's a perfect marksman.

35
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,360
Here son, show them.

36
00:03:57,117 --> 00:03:58,379
Wait!

37
00:03:59,219 --> 00:04:01,983
Wonderful! Whose voice is this?

38
00:04:02,155 --> 00:04:03,588
lt is of the voice
of Gora Shanker, ..

39
00:04:03,657 --> 00:04:05,648
..the son of the Chief of
gypsies, Raja Bahadur.

40
00:04:15,101 --> 00:04:18,593
Just call from this side to..

41
00:04:18,672 --> 00:04:25,339
..to the friends that side,
separated from long

42
00:04:25,612 --> 00:04:29,605
Just call from this side to..

43
00:04:29,683 --> 00:04:34,916
..to the friends that side,
separated from long

44
00:04:34,988 --> 00:04:38,617
Just once they embrace..

45
00:04:38,692 --> 00:04:44,631
..after breaking these
walls between us

46
00:04:44,698 --> 00:04:48,634
Just call from this side to..

47
00:04:48,702 --> 00:04:53,901
..to the friends that side,
separated from long

48
00:05:01,915 --> 00:05:03,576
l want to make friends with him..

49
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:05,914
.. Give him this gift on my behalf.

50
00:05:05,986 --> 00:05:07,078
Alright.

51
00:05:11,591 --> 00:05:14,924
Chief, the young Thakur has come
forward with his friendship.

52
00:05:17,163 --> 00:05:19,996
Tell him that friendship
doesn't need daggers.

53
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:22,066
He will himself have to
come for being friends.

54
00:05:22,936 --> 00:05:25,598
Tell him that friendship
can be made in two ways.

55
00:05:25,939 --> 00:05:27,600
Either it is childhood friendship
or it may be making..

56
00:05:27,674 --> 00:05:29,073
..friends at first meeting.

57
00:05:29,609 --> 00:05:31,600
Tell him that if he wants
to befriend Gora Shanker..

58
00:05:31,678 --> 00:05:33,942
..he should meet me on that
hillock tomorrow evening.

59
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,613
After meeting him l'll
decide whether..

60
00:05:35,682 --> 00:05:36,808
..l want to be friends
with him or not.

61
00:05:38,818 --> 00:05:39,876
What are you looking at?

62
00:05:41,021 --> 00:05:43,080
l'm looking at a friend
in first meeting, Thakur.

63
00:05:47,761 --> 00:05:48,819
lt feels good if a friend calls..

64
00:05:48,895 --> 00:05:50,123
..a friend by his name,
Gora Shanker.

65
00:05:54,634 --> 00:05:55,692
Prithvisingh, l'll be
happy if you come..

66
00:05:55,769 --> 00:05:57,361
..to our settlement sometime.

67
00:05:58,204 --> 00:05:59,262
l'll be happy too.

68
00:06:34,841 --> 00:06:38,607
We gypsies don't give our hearts..

69
00:06:38,678 --> 00:06:42,341
..we take lives, we give our lives

70
00:06:42,615 --> 00:06:45,846
We take tests of friends

71
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:49,184
We give tests of friendships

72
00:06:49,255 --> 00:06:52,713
We take tests of friends

73
00:06:52,792 --> 00:06:56,728
We give tests of friendships

74
00:06:56,796 --> 00:06:59,629
We gypsies don't give our hearts..

75
00:07:04,037 --> 00:07:07,302
We take tests of friends

76
00:07:07,574 --> 00:07:10,839
We give tests of friendships

77
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:14,175
We take tests of friends

78
00:07:14,247 --> 00:07:18,308
We give tests of friendships

79
00:07:51,785 --> 00:07:56,279
We are flowers and not stones

80
00:07:56,356 --> 00:08:01,055
We are lovers and not sellers

81
00:08:03,129 --> 00:08:07,566
We are flowers and not stones

82
00:08:07,634 --> 00:08:11,161
We are lovers and not sellers

83
00:08:11,237 --> 00:08:14,695
We are not your beloved

84
00:08:16,576 --> 00:08:20,569
No one should lie to us..

85
00:08:20,647 --> 00:08:24,083
..we accept the lies as truth

86
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:27,586
We take tests of friends.

87
00:08:27,654 --> 00:08:30,919
We give tests of friendships

88
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:34,187
We take tests of friends.

89
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:38,253
We give tests of friendships

90
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:08,227
Don't play games from
your eyes with us

91
00:09:08,294 --> 00:09:12,890
We understand the language
of the eyes

92
00:09:15,134 --> 00:09:19,662
Don't play games from
your eyes with us

93
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:23,832
We understand the language
of the eyes

94
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:27,243
The games played with kohl

95
00:09:28,982 --> 00:09:36,753
We recognise from far what
is inside or outside

96
00:09:36,823 --> 00:09:40,156
We take tests of friends

97
00:09:40,226 --> 00:09:43,753
We give tests of friendships

98
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:47,061
We take tests of friends

99
00:09:47,133 --> 00:09:51,092
We give tests of friendships

100
00:10:18,298 --> 00:10:22,632
When we make a promise
to someone..

101
00:10:22,702 --> 00:10:27,799
..the price of the promise
is more than our lives

102
00:10:29,876 --> 00:10:33,642
When we make a promise
to someone..

103
00:10:33,713 --> 00:10:38,275
..the price of the promise
is more than our lives

104
00:10:38,351 --> 00:10:42,117
What is your intention

105
00:10:43,222 --> 00:10:50,822
We can give our lives
for our promise

106
00:10:50,897 --> 00:10:54,264
We take tests of friends

107
00:10:54,334 --> 00:10:57,770
We take tests of friends

108
00:10:57,837 --> 00:11:01,068
We give tests of friendship

109
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:04,940
We give tests of friendship

110
00:11:05,011 --> 00:11:08,606
We gypsies don't give our hearts..

111
00:11:08,681 --> 00:11:12,208
..we take lives, we give our lives

112
00:11:12,285 --> 00:11:15,777
We take tests of friends

113
00:11:15,855 --> 00:11:19,086
We give tests of friendship

114
00:11:19,158 --> 00:11:22,321
We take tests of friends

115
00:11:22,628 --> 00:11:27,122
We give tests of friendship

116
00:11:59,665 --> 00:12:04,830
Brother says friendship happens
in childhood or at first sight.

117
00:12:06,606 --> 00:12:07,664
And love too.

118
00:12:12,612 --> 00:12:14,341
The sun can make friends
with darkness ..

119
00:12:15,014 --> 00:12:16,879
..the sky can embrace the earth ..

120
00:12:16,949 --> 00:12:18,610
..but my son cannot extend a hand..

121
00:12:18,684 --> 00:12:21,016
of friendship towards the gypsies.

122
00:12:22,889 --> 00:12:27,826
lf you speak such words again, l'll
punish you harshly. Now go!

123
00:12:33,132 --> 00:12:38,900
Jwala Singh, this man was not lying.

124
00:12:40,706 --> 00:12:44,233
Prithvi finally did what
he shouldn't have done.

125
00:12:55,288 --> 00:12:56,346
Prithvi.

126
00:12:56,989 --> 00:12:58,820
- Greetings, sir. - How are you,
Jwala Singh? - l'm fine.

127
00:12:59,659 --> 00:13:02,594
- Come, son. - Greetings, father.
- Bless you, son.

128
00:13:03,162 --> 00:13:06,791
Son, where did you disappear?

129
00:13:07,066 --> 00:13:10,866
l'm sorry father, l got late.
l went a little too far.

130
00:13:11,237 --> 00:13:14,866
Son, don't go so far.

131
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:27,784
Enough!
- Why, you should eat well!

132
00:13:28,187 --> 00:13:29,620
And all the dishes that
have been cooked..

133
00:13:29,689 --> 00:13:32,089
..are your favourite, not mine.

134
00:13:32,792 --> 00:13:35,625
After me, when you will sit on this
chair and serve your son ..

135
00:13:35,695 --> 00:13:39,222
..there will be no one to
serve you so lovingly.

136
00:13:39,632 --> 00:13:43,159
Don't say that father, l'll never
let you vacate this chair.

137
00:13:45,238 --> 00:13:47,638
You'll order the angel
of death to leave..

138
00:13:47,707 --> 00:13:49,368
and quietly he'll accept, right?

139
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:55,144
Come on. Open your mouth, l'll
feed you the first morsel.

140
00:14:08,828 --> 00:14:09,920
Chief, aim!

141
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:18,228
Come, Prithvi.

142
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,705
Here, you also try your aim.

143
00:14:25,011 --> 00:14:28,674
Me? - You are a Thakur, your
aim should be perfect. Here.

144
00:14:28,748 --> 00:14:31,615
Stand in a row, Thakur
will take aim..

145
00:14:31,684 --> 00:14:35,347
Why are you'll running away?

146
00:14:35,621 --> 00:14:39,614
Come on! - We know you trust
your friend's marksmanship ..

147
00:14:39,692 --> 00:14:42,684
..but why do you want us killed?

148
00:14:42,795 --> 00:14:44,353
l have small kids, Chief.

149
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:47,064
Shut-up and keep the pot on your
head. Where are you'll going?

150
00:14:47,967 --> 00:14:49,696
They only trust their Chief's
marksmanship.

151
00:14:49,769 --> 00:14:51,703
lt's not that. -Thakur

152
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,130
Thakur, take aim.

153
00:14:56,642 --> 00:14:59,236
Tara!
- Tara, don't be stupid.

154
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:07,813
What are you waiting for,
Thakur-ji. Take aim.

155
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,582
Prithvi, take aim. - But Shanker,
if something .. - Don't worry, aim.

156
00:15:16,929 --> 00:15:17,987
Come on!

157
00:15:43,623 --> 00:15:46,615
Thakur-ji. try shooting off
the dot on my forehead.

158
00:16:06,912 --> 00:16:10,643
What are you thinking?
- l'm not thinking, l'm watching.

159
00:16:11,183 --> 00:16:13,845
What?
- The dot on your forehead.

160
00:16:15,821 --> 00:16:20,258
Why didn't you target it?

161
00:16:22,194 --> 00:16:26,324
Only a foolish person can
shoot the moon in the sky!

162
00:16:29,602 --> 00:16:30,830
Your eyes!

163
00:16:32,938 --> 00:16:38,843
Do you know, when l close
my eyes, l see your face.

164
00:16:40,613 --> 00:16:44,242
Whenever l breath, l
smell your fragrance.

165
00:16:45,217 --> 00:16:47,879
When l sleep, you come in my dreams.

166
00:16:48,854 --> 00:16:51,618
Do you know what Phoolmati
was saying? - No.

167
00:16:53,626 --> 00:16:57,062
She said l was in love with you.

168
00:16:57,963 --> 00:16:59,021
Was she lying?

169
00:17:12,912 --> 00:17:15,312
- What happened, Hariya?
- Bhima was killed.

170
00:17:19,151 --> 00:17:22,985
Brother!
- What happened, Shanker?

171
00:17:23,823 --> 00:17:27,987
ln the duel with Azghar over
his sister, Bhima was killed.

172
00:17:28,227 --> 00:17:33,164
He was killed? This is an inhuman
way to settle scores.

173
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:38,330
Are we still living in the caves?
ls human life so cheap?

174
00:17:39,004 --> 00:17:40,767
Wish l could wipe
out this tradition.

175
00:17:42,675 --> 00:17:45,610
Even my father was killed
in this fashion, ..

176
00:17:45,678 --> 00:17:48,203
..but my clan accepted
it without remorse.

177
00:17:49,882 --> 00:17:50,940
And you?

178
00:17:54,086 --> 00:17:59,353
Who killed your father?
- Your father, Bhavani Singh.

179
00:18:03,562 --> 00:18:04,961
Yet you made friends with me.

180
00:18:06,565 --> 00:18:07,964
With the son of your
father's murderer?

181
00:18:08,901 --> 00:18:12,837
That was in the past, our friend
ship happened in the present.

182
00:18:13,639 --> 00:18:16,574
And this friendship will wipe
out this tradition ..

183
00:18:16,642 --> 00:18:18,633
..will end this hatred.

184
00:18:20,646 --> 00:18:22,978
Hating an enemy is healthy.

185
00:18:24,183 --> 00:18:27,016
Hatred is a stronger emotion
in life than love.

186
00:18:27,186 --> 00:18:28,778
l don't agree with you, father..

187
00:18:29,588 --> 00:18:31,249
Life is as it is short for love ..

188
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:33,683
..where can you spare
the time for hatred?

189
00:18:33,993 --> 00:18:36,587
Son. Love is a dumb emotion ..

190
00:18:36,662 --> 00:18:41,599
..which leaves you helpless
and at the mercy of others ..

191
00:18:41,667 --> 00:18:46,604
..the way it left Karan
at the mercy of Arjun, ..

192
00:18:46,672 --> 00:18:49,266
..who ultimately killed him.

193
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:52,673
But the world commemorates that
defeated soldier, Karan.

194
00:18:53,212 --> 00:18:56,010
His defeat was actually his victory.

195
00:18:57,116 --> 00:18:58,606
The outcome of a battle and not..

196
00:18:58,684 --> 00:19:00,709
..the commemoration spells victory.

197
00:19:01,187 --> 00:19:04,850
Tell me something, can you defeat
my brother in a horse race?

198
00:19:05,191 --> 00:19:07,625
Why did you think of a horse race?

199
00:19:07,893 --> 00:19:09,224
First answer my question.

200
00:19:09,628 --> 00:19:12,563
l will defeat him if you
say so, but tell me why?

201
00:19:12,798 --> 00:19:15,562
Brother says he'll get
me married to a man..

202
00:19:15,634 --> 00:19:17,261
..who defeats him in a horse race.

203
00:19:17,636 --> 00:19:19,968
- Alright then, l'll defeat him.
- Promise? - Promise!

204
00:21:25,197 --> 00:21:26,357
You were great, Prithvi!

205
00:21:26,966 --> 00:21:28,797
No one had ever defeated me
before in a horse race.

206
00:21:29,234 --> 00:21:31,634
You can ask anything from me today.

207
00:21:32,037 --> 00:21:33,800
- Anything? - Anything.

208
00:21:35,274 --> 00:21:36,366
l want Tara.

209
00:23:22,081 --> 00:23:28,281
You are rain, you are the rain..

210
00:23:28,353 --> 00:23:32,619
..l am the thirst, my beloved

211
00:23:33,225 --> 00:23:38,788
Come closer and quench my thirst

212
00:23:40,199 --> 00:23:42,690
You are the rain.

213
00:23:42,768 --> 00:23:46,636
..l am the thirst, my beloved

214
00:23:47,639 --> 00:23:52,906
Come closer and quench my thirst

215
00:23:54,279 --> 00:23:57,146
You are the rain.

216
00:24:11,864 --> 00:24:18,793
l am incomplete without you

217
00:24:19,271 --> 00:24:25,870
Touch me and make me complete

218
00:24:26,612 --> 00:24:33,211
l am incomplete without you

219
00:24:33,685 --> 00:24:39,681
Touch me and make me complete

220
00:24:40,626 --> 00:24:47,225
The fire of the union
is in my mind

221
00:24:47,299 --> 00:24:49,358
You are the rain.

222
00:24:49,902 --> 00:25:00,244
Come closer and quench my thirst

223
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:04,740
You are the rain.

224
00:25:18,997 --> 00:25:26,199
Let the paper not remain blank

225
00:25:26,271 --> 00:25:33,177
This youth is like a swift wind

226
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:40,346
Let the paper not remain blank

227
00:25:40,619 --> 00:25:46,717
This youth is like a swift wind

228
00:25:47,226 --> 00:25:53,790
How can you trust it, my love

229
00:25:54,099 --> 00:25:56,829
You are the rain.

230
00:25:56,902 --> 00:26:00,736
..l am the thirst, my beloved

231
00:26:01,573 --> 00:26:07,011
Come closer and quench my thirst

232
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:10,309
You are the rain.

233
00:26:10,916 --> 00:26:14,784
..l am the thirst, my beloved

234
00:26:15,854 --> 00:26:25,593
Come closer and quench my thirst

235
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:40,610
Thakur Ranjit Singh, the union
of Prithvi and Rajeshwari ..

236
00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:43,614
..is not the union of
two individuals ..

237
00:26:43,682 --> 00:26:46,947
..it is the union of two eminent
and powerful families.

238
00:26:48,186 --> 00:26:51,678
Thakur sir, where is Prithvi Singh?

239
00:26:52,224 --> 00:26:53,623
Kids nowadays are like air..

240
00:26:53,692 --> 00:26:57,025
..which is more outside
than inside the house.

241
00:26:59,197 --> 00:27:01,722
Thakur sir, you make arrangements
for the wedding. - Alright.

242
00:27:17,849 --> 00:27:20,044
Father, did some special
people come home?

243
00:27:20,652 --> 00:27:24,986
Yes son. Gadivilaspur's Thakur
Ranjit Singh had come.

244
00:27:26,191 --> 00:27:28,659
Why didn't you ask them
to wait for dinner?

245
00:27:29,194 --> 00:27:32,652
As per tradition, they cannot
dine in our house now.

246
00:27:33,198 --> 00:27:34,688
But he is your old friend.

247
00:27:35,934 --> 00:27:39,995
He was my friend, now
he is related to me.

248
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:46,104
l've arranged your marriage with
their daughter, Rajeshwari.

249
00:27:47,245 --> 00:27:48,303
What?!!

250
00:27:50,615 --> 00:27:55,780
- But you didn't even ask me.
- Asking is not a norm here.

251
00:27:56,621 --> 00:27:58,851
l have given Ranjit Singh my word.

252
00:27:59,958 --> 00:28:01,721
That is what has put
me in a dilemma.

253
00:28:02,828 --> 00:28:09,131
As per tradition, a word is a word,
whether given by you or me.

254
00:28:10,168 --> 00:28:12,227
You've given word to Ranjit Singh
and l have given word to..

255
00:28:12,304 --> 00:28:15,068
l know. To Gora Shanker's
sister, Tara.

256
00:28:15,574 --> 00:28:19,772
Yes, and that's why l cannot
marry anyone else but Tara.

257
00:28:21,813 --> 00:28:25,579
Look son, you have the right
to dishonor my word, ..

258
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:28,778
..because you are grown up now.

259
00:28:29,855 --> 00:28:34,815
But you have forgotten that it
is me who taught you to speak.

260
00:28:35,861 --> 00:28:37,590
That is why l am speaking
your language.

261
00:28:41,933 --> 00:28:44,663
You have the right to
reject this proposal.

262
00:28:46,872 --> 00:28:52,606
But if you do that, you'll be
responsible for the ruin ..

263
00:28:52,677 --> 00:28:58,013
..of Gora Shanker, his sister Tara,
and his entire gypsy clan.

264
00:28:59,618 --> 00:29:03,554
Therefore, before you
reject this proposal..

265
00:29:03,622 --> 00:29:06,716
..give it due thought, son.

266
00:29:28,914 --> 00:29:30,176
Brother, Prithvi's father is here.

267
00:29:32,651 --> 00:29:33,743
Welcome, Thakur!

268
00:29:35,187 --> 00:29:41,592
l know why you are welcoming
me, Shankar.

269
00:29:42,227 --> 00:29:44,991
A guest is always welcomed here.

270
00:29:45,197 --> 00:29:47,324
Don't mistake me to be
your guest, Shankar.

271
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,600
Your father had wanted to
grab my land once, ..

272
00:29:50,669 --> 00:29:53,763
..now you want to grab
my son from me today?

273
00:29:55,640 --> 00:30:00,236
History is repeating itself,
but l won't let that happen.

274
00:30:00,879 --> 00:30:04,610
lt is you and me who
wrote that history ..

275
00:30:04,683 --> 00:30:07,277
..but today, Prithvi and me
want to make a new history.

276
00:30:07,953 --> 00:30:11,616
Even l know how to play with words,
and with a gun too ..

277
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:15,626
..but you are playing
with my son's emotions..

278
00:30:15,694 --> 00:30:18,629
lt is in your nature to
play games, not ours.

279
00:30:19,798 --> 00:30:23,029
Then why are you allowing your
sister to play games with my son?

280
00:30:23,101 --> 00:30:26,229
- Thakur! - Gora Shanker, do you
know who you are talking to?

281
00:30:26,905 --> 00:30:28,702
Don't raise your voice, gypsy!

282
00:30:29,908 --> 00:30:31,899
The walls of my mansion
are too high for you.

283
00:30:32,911 --> 00:30:35,641
Don't try to use your
sister as a ladder..

284
00:30:35,714 --> 00:30:37,204
to gain entry into it.

285
00:30:38,650 --> 00:30:41,312
Then keep your son
behind those walls.

286
00:30:41,653 --> 00:30:43,712
Or he may come here
& become a gypsy.

287
00:30:43,788 --> 00:30:45,380
Stay in your limits, gypsy!

288
00:30:46,658 --> 00:30:49,320
Prithvi is a Thakur. Thakur's
blood is running in him.

289
00:30:50,262 --> 00:30:53,663
lf you get your sister
married to my son..

290
00:30:53,732 --> 00:30:55,996
..l'll burn down your settlement.

291
00:30:57,936 --> 00:31:02,669
Go Thakur, and ask your son
not to come here again ..

292
00:31:03,208 --> 00:31:05,608
..or your clan will
be finished today. Go!

293
00:31:10,615 --> 00:31:12,082
Cry as much as you want now, Tara.

294
00:31:12,884 --> 00:31:14,784
For l don't want to
see your tears again.

295
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:37,367
Why are your loving eyes
full of tears today?

296
00:31:39,044 --> 00:31:40,841
Your mansion's dust got into them.

297
00:31:41,646 --> 00:31:45,047
Your father had come to our
settlement. - He did?!

298
00:31:47,652 --> 00:31:50,246
- Shanker must have been surprised
to see him. - Yes.

299
00:31:50,989 --> 00:31:52,149
What did father tell him?

300
00:31:53,925 --> 00:31:56,655
He said to brother that
your mansion's walls..

301
00:31:56,728 --> 00:31:57,922
..are too high for him.

302
00:31:58,897 --> 00:32:01,593
That he should not
use his sister as..

303
00:32:01,666 --> 00:32:04,100
a ladder to gain entry into it.

304
00:32:06,605 --> 00:32:11,872
That means l'll have to take you
away from my eminent family, Tara

305
00:32:11,943 --> 00:32:14,605
No! lt means that Tara and Shanker..

306
00:32:14,679 --> 00:32:16,670
..have no place for
you in their lives.

307
00:32:16,881 --> 00:32:19,111
Shanker! - Call me Chief Gora
Shanker, Thakur Prithvi Singh!

308
00:32:19,884 --> 00:32:22,785
Can't you see, the high walls
of your mansion are between us.

309
00:32:23,221 --> 00:32:25,849
But my heart is not ruled
by those high walls.

310
00:32:26,691 --> 00:32:28,625
Tara is mine and no one can
separate her from me..

311
00:32:28,693 --> 00:32:30,183
..neither father, nor you.

312
00:32:30,262 --> 00:32:33,629
Tara, your brother is standing
between you and Prithvi Singh.

313
00:32:33,898 --> 00:32:36,230
To reach him, you'll have
to walk over my dead body.

314
00:32:37,636 --> 00:32:40,161
Tara. Here's your friendship,
l'm returning it.

315
00:32:42,641 --> 00:32:44,131
l'm taking Tara with me.

316
00:32:44,909 --> 00:32:46,638
lf you like, you can kill
me with this dragger, ..

317
00:32:46,711 --> 00:32:49,373
..which is a symbol of our
friendship, and stop me.

318
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:52,708
Let's go, Tara.

319
00:33:06,197 --> 00:33:09,655
l can neither leave
my brother, nor you.

320
00:33:11,236 --> 00:33:14,034
Ok. l'll become a gypsy if you
like. - That's not possible.

321
00:33:14,172 --> 00:33:19,007
Why not? - lf you do that, your
father will spare none of us.

322
00:33:19,678 --> 00:33:23,614
l don't fear killing anybody
or dying myself, ..

323
00:33:23,682 --> 00:33:29,780
..but will you be able to
see this bloodbath? - No!

324
00:33:30,088 --> 00:33:35,890
Love is written all over the skies

325
00:33:38,263 --> 00:33:45,635
The name of love is on all lips

326
00:33:47,706 --> 00:33:50,732
lt is a game of love..

327
00:33:50,975 --> 00:34:00,577
..but ..people play
with their lives

328
00:34:06,758 --> 00:34:11,661
Who l went to search for..
- Who l went to search for..

329
00:34:11,730 --> 00:34:14,164
Who l went to search for..

330
00:34:14,232 --> 00:34:15,699
Who l went to search for..

331
00:34:15,767 --> 00:34:17,826
Who l went to search for..

332
00:34:17,969 --> 00:34:21,905
l went to search for..
- Who l went to search for..

333
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:24,736
Who l went to search for..

334
00:34:24,809 --> 00:34:26,868
..l finally found him

335
00:34:26,945 --> 00:34:29,675
l found him

336
00:34:29,814 --> 00:34:33,682
Found him.. found him.. found him.

337
00:34:33,752 --> 00:34:38,689
..l finally found him.
l finally found him

338
00:34:38,757 --> 00:34:41,123
After finding him,
l myself was lost.

339
00:34:41,693 --> 00:34:43,923
l was lost. l was lost.

340
00:34:44,062 --> 00:34:45,654
l fell in love, l fell in love

341
00:34:45,730 --> 00:34:48,699
l fell in love, l fell in love

342
00:34:48,833 --> 00:34:53,998
l fell in love, l fell in love

343
00:34:54,072 --> 00:34:55,972
l fell in love, l fell in love

344
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:58,702
l fell in love, l fell in love

345
00:34:58,843 --> 00:35:01,243
l fell in love, l fell in love

346
00:35:11,189 --> 00:35:12,986
Call me a killer if you want

347
00:35:13,057 --> 00:35:15,958
You can call me a killer
if you wish.

348
00:35:16,094 --> 00:35:18,654
My religion is love

349
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:21,198
Love is my religion.

350
00:35:26,271 --> 00:35:31,072
Call me a killer if you want,
my religion is love.

351
00:35:31,209 --> 00:35:36,169
Call me a killer if you want,
my religion is love.

352
00:35:36,681 --> 00:35:41,243
Whatever l say, it
means love for me

353
00:35:41,319 --> 00:35:46,689
l mean it is love.
l mean it is love.

354
00:35:52,797 --> 00:35:55,231
Don't think it an infatuation

355
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:57,768
This is true love

356
00:35:58,002 --> 00:36:00,061
lt will take my life

357
00:36:00,138 --> 00:36:02,629
lt will ruin my life

358
00:36:03,041 --> 00:36:05,134
Aunt was saying Tara is pregnant.
- What!

359
00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:07,644
My breath is suffocating
in my heart

360
00:36:07,712 --> 00:36:09,805
There is a fire in my heart..

361
00:36:09,881 --> 00:36:13,647
Go out.
- But listen to ..- l said go out!

362
00:36:13,718 --> 00:36:17,848
A fire has raged

363
00:36:22,126 --> 00:36:24,720
The whole world is watching..

364
00:36:24,796 --> 00:36:27,230
..from a distance with amazement

365
00:36:27,298 --> 00:36:32,668
The whole world is watching from
a distance with amazement

366
00:36:32,737 --> 00:36:37,231
The seven oceans gave up, the
fire did not stop with water.

367
00:36:37,308 --> 00:36:42,143
The seven oceans gave up, the
fire did not stop with water.

368
00:36:42,213 --> 00:36:44,681
The fire could not be extinguished
with water.

369
00:36:44,749 --> 00:36:47,081
The fire could not be extinguished
with water.

370
00:36:47,151 --> 00:36:49,676
The fire could not be extinguished
with water.

371
00:36:49,954 --> 00:36:51,922
My heart is still in stages..

372
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:54,117
My heart is still in stages..

373
00:36:55,693 --> 00:36:57,786
You have disgraced your brother.

374
00:36:57,862 --> 00:37:05,928
Showers showered and went away

375
00:37:06,638 --> 00:37:08,970
Showers showered and went away

376
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:14,103
Showers showered and went away.
Showers showered and went away

377
00:37:14,178 --> 00:37:16,646
Even monsoons came and wept

378
00:37:16,714 --> 00:37:18,773
l am in love. l am in love.

379
00:37:18,850 --> 00:37:20,909
l am in love. l am in love.

380
00:37:20,985 --> 00:37:23,681
l am in love. l am in love.

381
00:37:33,665 --> 00:37:38,102
Will there be a funeral
or a wedding

382
00:37:38,803 --> 00:37:42,967
But l will surely meet him today

383
00:37:43,107 --> 00:37:45,803
Will there be a funeral
or a wedding?

384
00:37:45,877 --> 00:37:48,004
Will there be a funeral
or a wedding?

385
00:37:48,313 --> 00:37:50,713
But l will surely meet him today

386
00:37:50,782 --> 00:37:52,841
But l will surely meet him today

387
00:37:52,984 --> 00:37:55,680
A great thirst has
risen in my heart..

388
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:57,981
A great thirst has
risen in my heart..

389
00:37:58,056 --> 00:38:02,823
..it will rain heavily today
- ..it will rain heavily today

390
00:38:09,968 --> 00:38:14,632
Where am l coming from,
where am l going?

391
00:38:14,772 --> 00:38:19,232
What do l know.. what's
over here or there?

392
00:38:19,644 --> 00:38:24,172
After breaking my heart,
breaking all barriers..

393
00:38:24,649 --> 00:38:29,086
Wherver he goes, he will
take me with him

394
00:38:29,687 --> 00:38:33,919
Wherver he goes, he will
take me with him

395
00:38:34,092 --> 00:38:38,688
l have no clue to what
my beloved is thinking

396
00:38:38,930 --> 00:38:43,697
l have no clue to what
my beloved is thinking

397
00:38:43,835 --> 00:38:48,670
There is place for going,
but no idea of coming back

398
00:38:50,041 --> 00:38:52,669
Thakur-ji, what have you done!

399
00:38:53,211 --> 00:38:58,945
l've made you my wife so that
no one calls you names ..

400
00:38:59,651 --> 00:39:02,814
..nor dares to call my
child illegitimate.

401
00:39:03,888 --> 00:39:06,857
You are Thakur Prithvi
Singh's wife now!

402
00:39:06,924 --> 00:39:12,885
No one has ever returned
from the lane of love.

403
00:39:12,964 --> 00:39:14,795
l am in love, l am in love.

404
00:39:14,899 --> 00:39:17,060
l am in love, l am in love.

405
00:39:17,135 --> 00:39:19,626
l am in love, l am in love.

406
00:39:38,923 --> 00:39:42,984
Love is God, love is everything

407
00:39:43,061 --> 00:39:44,995
l am in love, l am in love.

408
00:39:45,063 --> 00:39:47,088
l am in love, l am in love.

409
00:39:47,165 --> 00:39:49,656
Love is magic, love is fragrance

410
00:39:49,734 --> 00:39:51,861
You and l are nothing without love

411
00:39:52,003 --> 00:39:53,698
l am in love, l am in love.

412
00:39:53,805 --> 00:39:55,830
l am in love, l am in love.

413
00:39:55,907 --> 00:39:58,102
There are thousand names
but love is alone

414
00:39:58,176 --> 00:40:00,269
What is there without love

415
00:40:00,344 --> 00:40:02,175
l am in love, l am in love.

416
00:40:02,246 --> 00:40:04,680
l am in love, l am in love.

417
00:40:04,749 --> 00:40:08,879
Love is crazy, this world
can never understand it

418
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:10,681
l am in love, l am in love.

419
00:40:10,822 --> 00:40:12,847
l am in love, l am in love.

420
00:40:12,990 --> 00:40:17,222
Love is everywhere. Temples and
mosques are alike for the heart

421
00:40:17,295 --> 00:40:19,160
l am in love, l am in love.

422
00:40:19,297 --> 00:40:21,697
l am in love, l am in love.

423
00:40:21,766 --> 00:40:23,734
l am in love, l am in love.

424
00:40:23,801 --> 00:40:25,826
l am in love, l am in love.

425
00:40:25,970 --> 00:40:27,699
l am in love, l am in love.

426
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:29,739
l am in love, l am in love.

427
00:40:29,807 --> 00:40:31,707
l am in love, l am in love.

428
00:40:31,776 --> 00:40:33,835
l am in love, l am in love.

429
00:40:33,978 --> 00:40:35,809
l am in love, l am in love.

430
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,848
l am in love, l am in love.

431
00:40:38,049 --> 00:40:39,846
l am in love, l am in love.

432
00:40:40,151 --> 00:40:46,715
l hope you didn't have to wait
too long. - No, not too long

433
00:40:47,925 --> 00:40:50,393
l don't know if l even have the
right to call you like this.

434
00:40:52,864 --> 00:40:54,331
You have complete right over me.

435
00:40:55,133 --> 00:40:57,658
Do you know, the man you are
giving this right to, ..

436
00:40:57,735 --> 00:41:00,101
..has to marry two women
on the same day?

437
00:41:00,171 --> 00:41:05,871
lt is love..

438
00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:08,001
Wipe that blood,
it is the blood of an enemy.

439
00:41:08,212 --> 00:41:11,670
No, it is the blood of my husband.

440
00:41:11,949 --> 00:41:14,042
Why don't you refuse to marry me?

441
00:41:15,686 --> 00:41:16,846
That would be selfish.

442
00:41:17,855 --> 00:41:22,019
You are aware by doing that,
there'll be a bloodbath.

443
00:41:24,228 --> 00:41:26,822
l'll accept being your second wife.

444
00:41:28,966 --> 00:41:30,831
Maybe it was destined.

445
00:41:31,636 --> 00:41:36,369
l'll go and bring Prithvi.
- lt's too late now, brother.

446
00:41:38,743 --> 00:41:40,370
The marriage must be over by now.

447
00:42:02,066 --> 00:42:06,002
Our first night will be a night
of silence for both for us ..

448
00:42:08,005 --> 00:42:10,303
..because neither do l have
anything more to say to you ..

449
00:42:11,776 --> 00:42:13,676
..and nor do you have
anything to say to me.

450
00:42:16,214 --> 00:42:18,774
But you will get all the
respect and honour ..

451
00:42:19,884 --> 00:42:22,717
..to which the daughter-in-law
of this mansion is entitled to.

452
00:42:23,688 --> 00:42:25,246
l know my limits.

453
00:42:27,692 --> 00:42:32,629
l promise you l will never try
to gain entry into your heart.

454
00:42:34,632 --> 00:42:37,624
l will always remain the
daughter-in-law of..

455
00:42:37,702 --> 00:42:39,294
this house & your second wife.

456
00:43:00,191 --> 00:43:03,217
Who is Tara?
- Who are you?

457
00:43:03,928 --> 00:43:07,864
l have come on behalf of
the mansion's mistress.

458
00:43:08,866 --> 00:43:11,994
l want to meet Tara.
- l'm Tara.

459
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:20,236
What do l have that your
mistress has asked for?

460
00:43:23,214 --> 00:43:26,274
l have not come to take,
but to give something.

461
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:34,148
What is this? - The wedding
night food of my mistress.

462
00:43:37,228 --> 00:43:39,890
Only your mistress
has a right to it.

463
00:43:41,632 --> 00:43:43,623
The husband and wife
have to eat it..

464
00:43:43,701 --> 00:43:45,032
together on the wedding night.

465
00:43:45,970 --> 00:43:47,028
You are right.

466
00:43:48,706 --> 00:43:52,073
But she doesn't want to eat
it until you have savored it.

467
00:43:57,281 --> 00:44:00,739
Welcome, Madam. Come, take a seat.

468
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:05,218
l'm not the mistress of the
mansion, l am only her maid.

469
00:44:06,190 --> 00:44:10,217
- l have recognized you,
mistress. - How?

470
00:44:11,595 --> 00:44:13,586
Only you could have asked me to..

471
00:44:13,664 --> 00:44:16,132
partake in the wedding night meal.

472
00:44:17,168 --> 00:44:20,331
You couldn't have asked
a maid to bring it.

473
00:44:22,673 --> 00:44:24,197
You are just like l
expected you to be.

474
00:44:25,609 --> 00:44:30,012
Since you are his first wife, l've
come to seek your permission

475
00:44:31,015 --> 00:44:36,351
l am fortunate to get
a rival like you.

476
00:44:37,888 --> 00:44:39,719
Don't insult me by calling
me your rival.

477
00:44:41,192 --> 00:44:43,626
l have come to share your
happiness and sorrows.

478
00:44:46,964 --> 00:44:49,626
What happiness or sorrow can
one share with a person ..

479
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:52,294
..who has lost everything?

480
00:44:53,237 --> 00:45:02,270
l have nothing but some dreams
and memories. - Tara.

481
00:45:08,052 --> 00:45:09,644
l had gone to the gypsy
settlement today.

482
00:45:10,988 --> 00:45:12,319
Your choice is indeed praiseworthy,

483
00:45:13,858 --> 00:45:15,758
lt really is difficult
To forget Tara.

484
00:45:18,829 --> 00:45:22,595
l can neither forget her,
nor meet her.

485
00:45:24,168 --> 00:45:27,763
The more l think of her, the
more l feel suffocated.

486
00:45:29,607 --> 00:45:31,336
l want to go out of
town for a few days.

487
00:45:33,077 --> 00:45:34,669
ln your happiness lies mine.

488
00:45:41,685 --> 00:45:43,016
You really are a mystery.

489
00:45:44,889 --> 00:45:48,620
Whenever l think l have
understood you ..

490
00:45:48,692 --> 00:45:51,684
..a new layer of your
goodness is revealed.

491
00:45:53,230 --> 00:45:58,691
l am nothing. Actually, goodness
lies in your eyes.

492
00:46:04,575 --> 00:46:07,135
Daughter-in-law!
- Yes, father.

493
00:46:07,912 --> 00:46:10,107
l don't know where Prithvi
has gone without asking me.

494
00:46:11,148 --> 00:46:13,241
This has never happened before.

495
00:46:14,652 --> 00:46:18,019
But he told me asking
is not the norm here.

496
00:46:18,089 --> 00:46:20,887
Daughter-in-law!
- Pardon me, father.

497
00:46:27,932 --> 00:46:29,661
Master.
- What is it?

498
00:46:30,201 --> 00:46:33,102
Shanker's sister, Tara is pregnant.

499
00:46:33,604 --> 00:46:38,041
So?
- People say it is Prithvi's child.

500
00:46:38,943 --> 00:46:42,140
Then kill Tara who
carries the child!

501
00:46:42,947 --> 00:46:45,347
And burn down the gypsy
settlement! Go!

502
00:46:58,262 --> 00:46:59,320
Patience, Tara.

503
00:47:01,065 --> 00:47:02,123
Hold.

504
00:47:11,575 --> 00:47:14,135
Everything will be alright, Tara!

505
00:47:21,852 --> 00:47:22,910
Prithvi!

506
00:47:28,159 --> 00:47:29,217
Prithvi!

507
00:47:31,595 --> 00:47:35,588
Run away! The Thakur's men
are coming to kill you.

508
00:47:35,666 --> 00:47:37,258
Run!

509
00:47:42,606 --> 00:47:50,012
Tara! Tara!

510
00:47:56,954 --> 00:48:01,084
Tara, the Thakur's men are coming
to kill you, come with me.

511
00:48:01,158 --> 00:48:04,218
Don't worry about me,
take this child with you.

512
00:48:04,795 --> 00:48:07,229
lt is Prithvi's memento. lt
is the symbol of my love.

513
00:48:07,631 --> 00:48:09,121
There is no time Tara, just listen.

514
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:15,901
Please take my child,
for Prithvi's sake!

515
00:49:24,908 --> 00:49:28,571
Shankar! Shankar!

516
00:49:35,919 --> 00:49:41,585
Phoolmati.. Who shot at you, tell
me! l won't spare that man.

517
00:49:42,226 --> 00:49:43,284
Tell me who shot at you!

518
00:49:44,194 --> 00:49:46,128
l'll kill him, Phoolmati!

519
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:53,593
Tara, the Thakur's men have
attacked, let's go.

520
00:49:53,671 --> 00:49:56,765
- But Phoolmati? - They
killed her. - Brother..

521
00:49:58,776 --> 00:50:01,040
- Where is your baby? -
Prithvi's wife took him.

522
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:05,911
See that no one escapes, burn
down this whole place.

523
00:50:16,827 --> 00:50:17,885
Hurry!

524
00:50:20,898 --> 00:50:23,799
You killed Phoolmati, l won't
spare you, you bastard!

525
00:50:30,641 --> 00:50:31,699
Brother!
- Tara, run away!

526
00:51:00,738 --> 00:51:02,000
No!

527
00:51:14,218 --> 00:51:15,276
Tara! Tara!

528
00:51:37,241 --> 00:51:38,299
Thakur!

529
00:51:49,253 --> 00:51:52,711
Thakur! Thakur!

530
00:51:59,263 --> 00:52:06,328
Tell me, what had Tara, Phoolmati
or my people done to you?

531
00:52:07,604 --> 00:52:12,337
Your sister saw dreams which
were not meant for her.

532
00:52:13,877 --> 00:52:17,608
The only punishment for
seeing such dreams ..

533
00:52:17,681 --> 00:52:20,912
..is to shut that person's
eyes forever.

534
00:52:20,984 --> 00:52:24,943
You have seen others die,
now watch yourself die.

535
00:52:25,222 --> 00:52:28,783
Leave me! l won't spare this Thakur!

536
00:52:28,959 --> 00:52:35,626
Leave me! l won't spare him. Let go!

537
00:52:35,799 --> 00:52:38,632
lnspector, just leave
me for a moment, ..

538
00:52:38,702 --> 00:52:42,365
..l don't mind being hanged
for killing him. Let go.

539
00:52:42,639 --> 00:52:45,369
l'll come back Thakur,
stay alive until then.

540
00:52:45,642 --> 00:52:48,167
lf you are a true Thakur, remain
alive until l return.

541
00:52:54,651 --> 00:52:57,279
Everything done?
- Only Tara's child escaped.

542
00:52:59,857 --> 00:53:06,285
Find him and kill him! Go!

543
00:53:08,198 --> 00:53:13,659
Father.. l have saved you from
the trouble of searching.

544
00:53:17,941 --> 00:53:21,877
Here is your grandson, Your progeny.

545
00:53:23,614 --> 00:53:27,710
Only you should have the
honour to kill him.

546
00:54:09,927 --> 00:54:10,985
Tara!

547
00:54:11,828 --> 00:54:15,195
Tara!

548
00:54:34,685 --> 00:54:42,615
We gypsies don't give our hearts..

549
00:54:42,693 --> 00:54:50,122
..we give our lives

550
00:54:52,803 --> 00:54:59,641
We take tests of friends.

551
00:54:59,910 --> 00:55:06,315
We take tests of friends

552
00:55:06,750 --> 00:55:13,656
We give tests of friendships.

553
00:55:13,924 --> 00:55:20,921
We give tests of friendships

554
00:55:22,199 --> 00:55:26,329
Thakur Bhavani Singh..
Thakur Bhavani Singh..

555
00:55:26,870 --> 00:55:31,830
Prithvi.. lt's not our tradition
to call fathers by their names.

556
00:55:31,908 --> 00:55:33,603
l don't acknowledge
such traditions..

557
00:55:33,677 --> 00:55:36,237
..which are made by you and
broken by you. - Prithvi!

558
00:55:36,847 --> 00:55:40,681
Who are you to take Tara and
her entire clan's life?

559
00:55:40,851 --> 00:55:43,718
- You promised me you wouldn't.
- l made no promise.

560
00:55:43,887 --> 00:55:46,617
l accepted everything you said and..

561
00:55:46,690 --> 00:55:49,955
..sacrificed my love for your sake.

562
00:55:50,861 --> 00:55:55,628
But today, l refuse to take
responsibility of that carnage..

563
00:55:55,699 --> 00:56:00,568
..because one amongst them is of
your daughter-in-law, Tara ..

564
00:56:00,637 --> 00:56:02,832
..and the rest are your relatives.

565
00:56:02,906 --> 00:56:07,570
Shut-up! l refuse to accept that
girl as my daughter-in-law ..

566
00:56:07,644 --> 00:56:12,013
..and those gypsies as my
relatives even today.

567
00:56:12,149 --> 00:56:14,913
Then refuse to accept
me as your son too.

568
00:56:15,986 --> 00:56:19,581
l had decided to go
away from here ..

569
00:56:19,656 --> 00:56:22,921
..but that will not be penalising
you in any way.

570
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:27,025
Now l will continue to stay here
but will never talk to you.

571
00:56:27,864 --> 00:56:30,128
You will crave to hear my voice.

572
00:56:30,834 --> 00:56:34,600
You will want me to
speak but l won't ..

573
00:56:34,671 --> 00:56:38,163
..so that you realise what it
is to part from dear ones.

574
00:56:57,227 --> 00:57:02,290
You have promised not to speak
to father, not to me.

575
00:57:06,136 --> 00:57:13,065
Your son, the symbol of Tara and
your love is with me. Your son.

576
00:57:27,858 --> 00:57:31,988
You have a right to my admiration
for saving him.

577
00:57:34,164 --> 00:57:35,222
But not to your love?

578
00:57:40,937 --> 00:57:42,336
l'm indebted to you, Rajeshwari.

579
00:57:45,942 --> 00:57:49,935
l'm indebted to you for life.

580
00:59:30,146 --> 00:59:31,204
Bless you.

581
00:59:35,652 --> 00:59:40,316
How long will Prithvi not talk
to me? l cannot bear his silence.

582
00:59:42,592 --> 00:59:43,650
l'm helpless, father.

583
01:00:07,884 --> 01:00:13,754
Congratulations, master! A grandson
has been born to you.

584
01:00:13,823 --> 01:00:20,626
Prithvi, did you hear that, your
son, family heir has been born!

585
01:00:20,697 --> 01:00:21,755
You have become a father!

586
01:00:39,249 --> 01:00:40,307
He's just like you.

587
01:00:42,252 --> 01:00:43,651
Rajeshwari.

588
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:49,659
This gift of yours to father has
filled his life with happiness.

589
01:01:00,870 --> 01:01:02,667
Let's not talk about
these things today.

590
01:01:05,842 --> 01:01:08,606
Let me soak in this Happiness today.

591
01:01:53,223 --> 01:01:55,748
Have this holy food. Let's go.

592
01:01:55,925 --> 01:01:59,122
- Grandpa, give me some
too. - Let's go.

593
01:02:07,070 --> 01:02:09,197
Come, l'll give you holy food.

594
01:02:16,846 --> 01:02:18,837
- Shall l ask you something,
father? - Yes, son.

595
01:02:18,948 --> 01:02:20,609
Why does Pratap call Chhoti Ma
(younger mother) only Ma, ..

596
01:02:20,683 --> 01:02:23,243
..why doesn't he address her
as Chhoti Ma like l do?

597
01:02:24,888 --> 01:02:28,346
Whom you call Chhoti Ma
is Pratap's mother.

598
01:02:29,025 --> 01:02:30,287
Then where is my mother?

599
01:02:35,031 --> 01:02:36,794
Your mother was killed.

600
01:02:38,101 --> 01:02:41,798
- Killed? - Yes. - Who killed her?

601
01:02:45,975 --> 01:02:47,806
Ask that to your grandpa.

602
01:02:51,247 --> 01:02:52,737
Grandpa!

603
01:02:54,117 --> 01:02:56,244
You shouldn't have told
this to Ranvir.

604
01:02:58,221 --> 01:03:01,884
The truth should not be kept
hidden from children.

605
01:03:07,764 --> 01:03:09,994
Grandpa, who killed my mother?

606
01:03:12,168 --> 01:03:13,226
l don't know.

607
01:03:13,603 --> 01:03:17,039
He does, but doesn't have
the courage to say it.

608
01:03:18,007 --> 01:03:20,669
- You! - Your grandpa is
your mother's killer, son.

609
01:03:21,211 --> 01:03:22,906
Always remember that.

610
01:03:23,213 --> 01:03:24,305
Who allowed you to come in?

611
01:03:24,614 --> 01:03:26,775
Death does not need
anyone's permission.

612
01:03:27,217 --> 01:03:30,778
l'd promised you l'll come. l'm
pleased to see you still alive.

613
01:03:30,887 --> 01:03:33,822
How dare you threaten
me in my own house!

614
01:03:33,923 --> 01:03:37,791
l'm not threatening you,
l'm reminding you.

615
01:03:38,628 --> 01:03:42,621
lf you are a strict follower of
tradition, lets settle our score

616
01:03:42,699 --> 01:03:46,863
..the way you'd settled the score
with my father years ago.

617
01:03:46,970 --> 01:03:53,967
Shanker, since l'm his son,
l accept your challenge.

618
01:03:55,245 --> 01:03:56,940
A war should be among equals.

619
01:03:57,280 --> 01:04:00,579
Prithvi.
- l have come to avenge the death..

620
01:04:00,650 --> 01:04:03,915
of my sister and clan from Thakur.

621
01:04:04,587 --> 01:04:06,578
You don't interfere between us..

622
01:04:06,656 --> 01:04:09,056
..or even you'll face death,
Prithvi Singh.

623
01:04:09,125 --> 01:04:12,686
Call me Thakur Prithvi Singh.

624
01:04:15,198 --> 01:04:19,999
Until l'm alive, no one can
challenge my father to a duel.

625
01:04:21,938 --> 01:04:25,271
Therefore, it will be
better if you return.

626
01:04:25,842 --> 01:04:27,605
Prithvi Singh.

627
01:04:27,677 --> 01:04:30,703
Thakur Prithvi Singh, have you
forgotten that you married Tara?

628
01:04:31,014 --> 01:04:34,780
l am my father's son first.
- That is why you are a traitor.

629
01:04:34,851 --> 01:04:39,220
Gora Shanker! Wish you were not
standing in my house right now.

630
01:04:39,289 --> 01:04:41,689
What would you do if l was outside?

631
01:04:41,958 --> 01:04:48,295
l would kill you for abusing us.

632
01:04:48,965 --> 01:04:52,799
Alright, you support the
murderer of my sister.

633
01:04:53,636 --> 01:04:54,967
l'll support my sister.

634
01:04:55,805 --> 01:04:58,638
And tomorrow's sunrise will see..

635
01:04:58,708 --> 01:05:00,972
Who has the right to win this war.

636
01:05:03,580 --> 01:05:08,108
Prithvi, my son, l'm proud of you.

637
01:05:09,219 --> 01:05:11,187
You are my true heir.

638
01:05:49,959 --> 01:05:53,895
You are leaving, but do come back.

639
01:05:56,232 --> 01:05:57,631
l'll wait for you.

640
01:06:00,169 --> 01:06:03,570
One waits for those who
leave, Rajeshwari..

641
01:06:03,640 --> 01:06:07,974
..but l am with you, & will
always be with you.

642
01:08:33,222 --> 01:08:37,659
No! Prithvi..

643
01:08:42,932 --> 01:08:45,992
Why did you do it? Why didn't
you fire, Prithvi?

644
01:08:49,238 --> 01:08:51,035
You cheated! You took undue
advantage of our friendship.

645
01:08:51,674 --> 01:08:53,869
No. lt was necessary, Shankar.

646
01:08:55,211 --> 01:08:57,611
l don't want this tradition
of hatred..

647
01:08:57,680 --> 01:09:00,274
..to run into the next generation.

648
01:09:00,616 --> 01:09:03,176
You could have done
that by killing me.

649
01:09:03,252 --> 01:09:06,949
No Shankar. lf l had killed you,
father would not understand.

650
01:09:08,558 --> 01:09:12,551
My death can bring an
end to his atrocities..

651
01:09:12,628 --> 01:09:15,119
..and tradition of hatred.

652
01:09:16,899 --> 01:09:25,068
Take Ranvir with you and try
to keep him away from hatred.

653
01:09:26,142 --> 01:09:29,976
Promise me. - l promise.
-Promise me.

654
01:09:37,653 --> 01:09:42,647
Father! Father!

655
01:09:44,126 --> 01:09:45,184
Father!

656
01:10:06,949 --> 01:10:10,009
Prithvi!

657
01:10:13,623 --> 01:10:21,120
Who knows when this
thirst will end

658
01:10:21,631 --> 01:10:29,299
Who knows when this
thirst will end

659
01:10:29,972 --> 01:10:37,811
She will drink the
blood of who knows..

660
01:10:37,980 --> 01:10:41,916
..how many more innocent men

661
01:10:42,251 --> 01:10:46,085
This thirsty land demands
the blood..

662
01:10:46,255 --> 01:10:50,316
..of all innocent people

663
01:11:23,893 --> 01:11:27,727
Father, Brother Shanker, please!

664
01:11:57,259 --> 01:12:00,592
Ranvir, your father wanted
me to take you..

665
01:12:00,663 --> 01:12:03,598
..away from this land of hatred ..

666
01:12:03,666 --> 01:12:08,831
..where there is only
love and peace.

667
01:12:48,711 --> 01:12:53,045
Prithvi, my son, what did you do!

668
01:12:57,219 --> 01:12:58,743
Bow your head at this place.

669
01:12:59,655 --> 01:13:02,886
This is the place where your father
was killed. Bow your head son.

670
01:13:10,933 --> 01:13:12,594
Remember this place Pratap..

671
01:13:12,668 --> 01:13:16,001
..this is the place where
your father died.

672
01:13:28,184 --> 01:13:29,242
Who killed him, grand father?

673
01:13:29,785 --> 01:13:32,276
The Chief of the gypsies,
Gora Shanker.

674
01:13:47,703 --> 01:13:52,367
Son Ranvir, see this place
and always remember it.

675
01:13:53,809 --> 01:13:55,140
This is where your father died.

676
01:13:56,645 --> 01:14:02,208
While dying he said he wanted
you to stay away from hatred.

677
01:14:40,819 --> 01:14:44,152
My beloved..

678
01:14:44,323 --> 01:14:47,383
..come with me

679
01:14:48,060 --> 01:14:54,989
What if something happens!
lf you get lost in the way..

680
01:14:55,067 --> 01:14:58,468
Then what will l do

681
01:14:59,071 --> 01:15:02,472
My beloved..

682
01:15:02,741 --> 01:15:06,006
..come with me

683
01:15:06,145 --> 01:15:13,074
What if something happens!
lf you get lost in the way..

684
01:15:13,218 --> 01:15:16,676
Then what will l do

685
01:15:17,156 --> 01:15:24,187
My beloved.. Come with me.

686
01:15:43,115 --> 01:15:46,107
These are dreams l have not seen

687
01:15:46,318 --> 01:15:50,220
These paths are all new to me

688
01:15:50,789 --> 01:15:57,718
That is why l am asking
you to hold my arm

689
01:16:01,967 --> 01:16:05,061
These are dreams l have not seen

690
01:16:05,304 --> 01:16:08,899
These paths are all new to me

691
01:16:09,742 --> 01:16:16,671
That is why l am asking
you to hold my arm

692
01:16:16,849 --> 01:16:20,683
With the fragile thread of love..

693
01:16:20,753 --> 01:16:23,779
..you have tied me to yourself

694
01:16:23,856 --> 01:16:27,292
Oh my love

695
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:31,196
My beloved..

696
01:16:31,697 --> 01:16:34,689
..come with me

697
01:16:35,100 --> 01:16:38,433
What if something happens!

698
01:16:38,871 --> 01:16:42,204
lf you get lost in the way..

699
01:16:42,274 --> 01:16:45,869
What will l do ?

700
01:16:46,278 --> 01:16:53,810
My beloved.. come with me.

701
01:17:12,671 --> 01:17:16,072
What will you do if l get lost?

702
01:17:16,141 --> 01:17:19,736
l'll get lost too.

703
01:17:20,245 --> 01:17:23,408
What will happen if that happens

704
01:17:23,682 --> 01:17:27,675
l will go crazy

705
01:17:31,790 --> 01:17:35,191
What will you do if l get lost?

706
01:17:35,260 --> 01:17:39,026
l'll get lost too.

707
01:17:39,264 --> 01:17:42,791
What will happen if that happens

708
01:17:42,868 --> 01:17:46,964
l will go crazy

709
01:17:47,039 --> 01:17:50,702
These sweet talks of yours..

710
01:17:50,776 --> 01:17:53,904
..have won over my heart

711
01:17:54,046 --> 01:17:57,777
Oh my love

712
01:18:01,720 --> 01:18:08,990
My beloved.. Come with me.

713
01:18:09,061 --> 01:18:12,326
What if something happens..

714
01:18:12,664 --> 01:18:16,100
lf you get lost in the way.

715
01:18:16,168 --> 01:18:19,228
Then what will l do?

716
01:18:19,872 --> 01:18:23,672
Then what will l do?

717
01:18:24,009 --> 01:18:27,672
My beloved..

718
01:18:27,746 --> 01:18:31,079
Come with me.

719
01:18:31,316 --> 01:18:34,752
My beloved..

720
01:18:35,020 --> 01:18:38,183
Come with me.

721
01:20:19,992 --> 01:20:21,050
What a rider!

722
01:20:32,170 --> 01:20:34,832
Hi!
- Hi! This is a competition list.

723
01:20:35,274 --> 01:20:39,938
Let's go and check the list of
the sword fencing competition.

724
01:20:40,012 --> 01:20:43,413
Sword Fencing Competition..
Karan Paul, Krishna Singh..

725
01:20:43,949 --> 01:20:45,007
Pratap Singh.

726
01:20:45,317 --> 01:20:49,413
Ranvir Singh. Who is this
Ranvir Singh? - That's me.

727
01:20:55,027 --> 01:20:56,927
There is a lot of difference
between a horse and a sword.

728
01:20:57,329 --> 01:21:00,264
Yes of course.

729
01:21:03,702 --> 01:21:06,694
Oh, l am finished.
He's going to beat me to it.

730
01:21:06,772 --> 01:21:08,706
He rode the horse very well.

731
01:21:08,774 --> 01:21:10,241
Maybe he's still better
with a sword.

732
01:21:10,842 --> 01:21:11,831
God save the country!

733
01:21:40,005 --> 01:21:41,063
Come on!

734
01:21:54,252 --> 01:21:55,310
Come on Pratap!

735
01:23:20,105 --> 01:23:22,630
Sorry. l am sorry!

736
01:23:33,251 --> 01:23:38,211
- Are you alright? - Wonder what
happened to him. Did he go mad?

737
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,992
There are many more interesting
things to see than that wound.

738
01:24:11,156 --> 01:24:13,249
Bye, See you!
- Bye!

739
01:24:20,031 --> 01:24:21,430
Hi!

740
01:24:26,705 --> 01:24:29,697
Hi. - Hi Ranvir! - Just listen to me.

741
01:24:53,732 --> 01:24:54,790
Oops! l'm sorry.

742
01:24:56,334 --> 01:24:57,392
Hi! How are you?

743
01:24:57,736 --> 01:24:59,727
Pooja, meet me in the canteen and
bring the notes too.

744
01:24:59,804 --> 01:25:02,739
Ok, Bye! - Bye!

745
01:25:26,865 --> 01:25:28,765
Vijaya, what is your name?

746
01:25:29,868 --> 01:25:33,201
No! Excuse me, what is your name?

747
01:25:36,341 --> 01:25:38,309
Excuse me, what is your name?

748
01:25:41,780 --> 01:25:43,941
Excuse me, what is your name?

749
01:25:44,316 --> 01:25:49,344
Excuse me. - Yes? - Can
l have your cricket bat?

750
01:25:50,055 --> 01:25:52,319
Bat?
- Yes, l want to practice football.

751
01:25:53,191 --> 01:25:56,786
Football? - You don't have it?
lt is okay. No problem.

752
01:25:56,861 --> 01:25:59,125
No problem, l'll take
it from someone else.

753
01:25:59,798 --> 01:26:01,459
ok, do not worry. thank you..

754
01:26:02,133 --> 01:26:03,191
Cricket, football!

755
01:26:08,974 --> 01:26:11,135
Ranvir, you're impossible!

756
01:26:12,277 --> 01:26:18,341
You are an idiot. i.. d.. i.. o.. t.
idiot.

757
01:26:20,785 --> 01:26:25,085
Then what happened, what could l do?
Then what! l was so scared.

758
01:26:25,156 --> 01:26:27,181
They braced myself up.

759
01:26:30,695 --> 01:26:31,753
May l?

760
01:26:32,097 --> 01:26:33,155
Sure. Have a seat.

761
01:26:34,699 --> 01:26:36,223
'See how readily she agreed.'

762
01:26:37,035 --> 01:26:39,026
'lt seems she herself
wants to talk to you.'

763
01:26:40,038 --> 01:26:44,134
'But you don't pay attention to
her, turn your back to her.'

764
01:26:45,877 --> 01:26:48,437
'Yes, now she herself
will talk to you.'

765
01:26:50,782 --> 01:26:53,910
'And why not! Where will she
get another man like you.'

766
01:26:55,053 --> 01:26:56,987
'You just continue to
drink your Pepsi.'

767
01:27:00,325 --> 01:27:02,725
'What is the matter, she's
not saying anything.'

768
01:27:04,329 --> 01:27:08,390
'Come on, why act stubborn
in love. You talk to her.'

769
01:27:10,335 --> 01:27:11,393
You know..

770
01:29:39,017 --> 01:29:41,952
This is the time of the youth

771
01:29:43,021 --> 01:29:45,319
The song of us crazy people

772
01:29:46,024 --> 01:29:49,187
This is the time of the youth

773
01:29:49,694 --> 01:29:52,754
The song of us crazy people

774
01:29:53,298 --> 01:29:56,859
We are the people of the new world

775
01:29:56,935 --> 01:30:00,268
Forget all that is old

776
01:30:00,705 --> 01:30:03,196
This is the time of the youth

777
01:30:04,042 --> 01:30:06,909
The song of us crazy people

778
01:30:07,345 --> 01:30:11,042
We are the people of the new world

779
01:30:11,115 --> 01:30:14,710
Forget all that is old

780
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:32,663
Tell this world..

781
01:30:32,737 --> 01:30:35,865
..to match steps with us

782
01:30:36,307 --> 01:30:39,674
They might get left behind

783
01:30:39,744 --> 01:30:42,679
We will move forward

784
01:30:43,681 --> 01:30:47,674
We move faster than
the wind also..

785
01:30:47,752 --> 01:30:50,846
..we want to make
the world bow down

786
01:30:51,022 --> 01:30:53,684
This is the time of the youth

787
01:30:54,292 --> 01:30:57,420
The song of us crazy people

788
01:30:58,296 --> 01:31:01,857
We are the people of the new world

789
01:31:01,933 --> 01:31:05,232
Forget all that is old

790
01:31:26,925 --> 01:31:30,326
This style of living..

791
01:31:30,395 --> 01:31:33,990
..is both difficult and easy

792
01:31:34,132 --> 01:31:37,659
Who we have given our hearts to..

793
01:31:37,735 --> 01:31:40,932
..we have given our life also

794
01:31:41,940 --> 01:31:44,773
Love is everything for us

795
01:31:44,943 --> 01:31:48,344
An excuse to live and die

796
01:31:48,680 --> 01:31:51,274
This is the time of the youth

797
01:31:52,283 --> 01:31:55,081
The song of us crazy people

798
01:31:55,820 --> 01:31:59,221
We are the people of the new world

799
01:31:59,290 --> 01:32:02,885
Forget all that is old

800
01:32:30,989 --> 01:32:33,048
Mummy!

801
01:32:33,291 --> 01:32:39,389
Pratap! what a surprise.
How come you came?

802
01:32:39,664 --> 01:32:42,132
l was bored of eating hostel food.

803
01:32:42,266 --> 01:32:46,100
And the blessings l had of you
and grandpa were also over.

804
01:32:46,671 --> 01:32:49,333
So l thought l'll collect some
fresh stock of blessings.

805
01:32:49,674 --> 01:32:56,011
How are you, son?
- Greetings, grandpa!

806
01:32:56,280 --> 01:33:00,182
Bless you, son. l feel so
pleased to embrace you.

807
01:33:00,685 --> 01:33:02,209
You are my heir after all.

808
01:33:43,661 --> 01:33:47,153
You win again, uncle. - To win,
you need to learn to lose too.

809
01:33:47,665 --> 01:33:50,133
- You must have never been
defeated. - l was defeated once.

810
01:33:51,269 --> 01:33:54,067
- Who could have defeated
you? - Your father.

811
01:33:57,942 --> 01:33:59,000
Open your mouth.

812
01:34:03,147 --> 01:34:04,842
l'll feed you the first morsel.

813
01:34:07,018 --> 01:34:10,681
- Grandpa, why did you
stop? - Eat, son.

814
01:34:18,696 --> 01:34:23,030
Will you come to the movies with
me? - l'll have to ask mom.

815
01:34:24,035 --> 01:34:25,297
We'll take your mother along too.

816
01:34:26,170 --> 01:34:27,228
You are crazy.

817
01:34:29,173 --> 01:34:32,438
You two are engrossed in your self,
give a thought to me too.

818
01:34:33,177 --> 01:34:39,013
What should we think about you?
- How do l tell a girl l like her?

819
01:34:41,052 --> 01:34:44,249
- Let me think. - What's so tough
about that, buy her a gift.

820
01:34:45,323 --> 01:34:47,120
Good idea. Very good.

821
01:34:47,191 --> 01:34:48,715
But the gift should be such that.

822
01:34:48,793 --> 01:34:52,285
the girl faints on receiving it.
0765 Take this son. -Wonderful!

823
01:34:52,730 --> 01:34:53,788
Pack this up for me.

824
01:34:53,998 --> 01:34:55,056
Wrap it in a nice wrapper.

825
01:35:00,071 --> 01:35:02,198
You're buying this!
- yes. - Naughty boy!

826
01:35:06,144 --> 01:35:07,236
Bye.
- Bye.

827
01:35:12,016 --> 01:35:15,747
Excuse me. - Yes? -Vijaya-ji,
l have a gift for you.

828
01:35:15,953 --> 01:35:21,084
For me? - Yes. - How sweet!
Thank you. - You're welcome.

829
01:35:21,692 --> 01:35:23,956
- What's in it? - See for yourself.

830
01:35:29,033 --> 01:35:30,091
No, no.

831
01:35:30,968 --> 01:35:33,300
Giving a gift is not a good idea,
think of something else.

832
01:35:34,038 --> 01:35:38,873
Alright, then take her some flowers.

833
01:35:40,044 --> 01:35:43,036
- What flower? - Cauliflower!
What a stupid question.

834
01:35:43,881 --> 01:35:45,041
Roses are for lovers.

835
01:35:47,351 --> 01:35:55,053
Yes. Roses.. Lovers..
That's a good idea.

836
01:36:03,734 --> 01:36:04,792
Excuse me.

837
01:36:06,070 --> 01:36:11,940
- Yes? - These are flowers.
- l can see that. But why?

838
01:36:13,811 --> 01:36:17,178
That's difficult to say. Maybe
the flowers can tell you why.

839
01:36:17,682 --> 01:36:18,740
Please accept them.

840
01:36:39,770 --> 01:36:44,298
No, even this idea is no good.

841
01:36:44,375 --> 01:36:45,433
Think of some good idea.

842
01:36:46,310 --> 01:36:49,279
Do something. Write her
a nice love letter.

843
01:36:49,714 --> 01:36:52,979
- Stupid idea! - l know
what the girls like.

844
01:36:53,184 --> 01:36:55,448
- You have never written a love
letter to me. - l have. - When?

845
01:36:56,721 --> 01:36:58,450
lf l didn't write it to you,
whom did l write it to?

846
01:36:58,789 --> 01:37:00,848
l was only joking.

847
01:37:00,925 --> 01:37:04,122
Hey, please! This is my problem.
Why are you fighting?

848
01:37:05,296 --> 01:37:08,129
l have very bad hand writing.
She won't be able to read it.

849
01:37:08,332 --> 01:37:10,129
Even l won't be able to
read it if she asks me.

850
01:37:10,735 --> 01:37:14,296
You're too much! - We'll have
to think of something special.

851
01:37:14,372 --> 01:37:15,669
Let me think.

852
01:37:19,010 --> 01:37:20,068
Thought of something?

853
01:37:25,683 --> 01:37:26,741
Damn!

854
01:37:28,252 --> 01:37:29,310
l don't believe it.

855
01:37:31,289 --> 01:37:35,157
Excuse me. My name is
Ranvir and l love you.

856
01:37:51,342 --> 01:37:55,904
Thank you pals. Thank you!

857
01:37:56,881 --> 01:38:02,251
l have done it ! l have done it.

858
01:38:02,320 --> 01:38:05,050
After pestering us for so long,
you did it yourself?

859
01:38:05,122 --> 01:38:08,717
lf l'd taken up your ideas,
she'd marry someone else ..

860
01:38:08,793 --> 01:38:10,283
..and l'd be left playing the flute!

861
01:38:36,087 --> 01:38:39,682
ln this country of flowers..

862
01:38:39,757 --> 01:38:43,124
..even thorns are feared

863
01:38:43,861 --> 01:38:47,194
No one should come here..

864
01:38:47,298 --> 01:38:54,795
..we are loving each other..

You know how Pratap is, he must
be searching for his clothes.

913
01:44:25,703 --> 01:44:27,034
And Ranvir must be calling him.

914
01:44:28,205 --> 01:44:30,867
Hi baby! Will you come
to the disco with me?

915
01:44:31,308 --> 01:44:32,707
l don't dance with strangers.

916
01:44:32,776 --> 01:44:37,110
Come on! Your mother always danced
near strangers and you ..

917
01:44:38,982 --> 01:44:43,385
What did you say? - l'm sorry,
but what does she mean to you?

918

She's my sister. Want

919
01:44:51,795 --> 01:44:52,887
Get out, you bastard.

920

Sapana, did you tell Pratap
about yourself? - No.

921
01:45:14,852 --> 01:45:19,846

01:45:27,865 --> 01:45:30,197
Nobody is talking. Doesn't matter.

924
01:45:31,702 --> 01:45:37,971
Pratap, drop me home.
- Come. -Bye!

925
01:45:40,043 --> 01:45:41,101

Relax! What are you thinking?

927
01:45:53,891 --> 01:45:59,295
l don't know why the past can
never leave a man alone.

928
01:46:10,207 --> 01:46:13,267
Sapana, what is the matter?
Why are you so quiet?

929
01:46:15,679 --> 01:46:16,737

Tell me whatever you want to.

934
01:46:30,961 --> 01:46:32,690

..commercial singer.

936
01:46:39,703 --> 01:46:41,330
One fine day, daddy
came in to her life.

937
01:46:42,339 --> 01:46:45,365
He got her out of the brothel
and took her home.

938
01:46:46,310 --> 01:46:47,777
l'm proud of my Dad, Pratap.

939
01:46:48,312 --> 01:46:50,780
He didn't make my mama his keep.

940
01:46:51,315 --> 01:46:52,373
He made her his wife.

941
01:46:53,317 --> 01:46:54,944
And today l'm here,
their only daughter.

942
01:46:57,988 --> 01:47:03,324

01:57:22,912 --> 01:57:25,176
l think our picnic ls ruined.

1040
01:57:25,281 --> 01:57:28,114
Wonder when Ranvir and
Pratap will come.

1041
01:57:28,685 --> 01:57:30,312
The sugar is here, the
flies will follow.

1042
01:57:31,287 --> 01:57:35,087
- He speaks! - l'm deaf,
but not mad.

1043
01:57:36,759 --> 01:57:38,852
This is our luggage.
Take it upstairs.

1044
01:57:39,195 --> 01:57:42,358
- What? - Take our luggage upstairs.

1045
01:57:42,966 --> 01:57:45,127
Why are you shouting? l
said l'm deaf, not mad.

1046
01:57:45,969 --> 01:57:49,871
l'm not responsible for breakage.
- Nothing breakable in it. - Okay.

1047
01:57:49,939 --> 01:57:53,033
Ouch!
- Stupid. - We are doomed! Come on.

1048
01:57:56,045 --> 01:57:58,912
Do one thing. Please get
us two cups of hot tea.

1049
01:57:59,048 --> 01:58:00,709
That means you two don't
even know to make tea.

1050
01:58:01,117 --> 01:58:04,177
Leave what we know or don't to
us. You go get us tea fast.

1051
01:58:04,721 --> 01:58:09,852
- Your in-laws would like to
know these things. - ln-laws?

1052
01:58:12,729 --> 01:58:13,855
Very strange man!

1053
01:58:22,338 --> 01:58:24,272
Hi girls!
- Hi!

1054
01:58:24,807 --> 01:58:26,274
- Where is Pratap?
- He's on his way.

1055
01:58:26,876 --> 01:58:27,934
Did you meet uncle?

1056
01:58:28,144 --> 01:58:31,739
No, but we met your servant,
he's a strange man.

1057
01:58:33,349 --> 01:58:36,807
Hi. Hi Everybody.
- Hi!

1058
01:58:37,887 --> 01:58:41,345
- Sorry guys. l'm late.
- What's in your hand?

1059
01:58:41,424 --> 01:58:44,689
l'm meeting his uncle for the first
time, so l bought a present

1060
01:58:45,094 --> 01:58:47,085
Can l have a glass of water?
- l'll get it.

1061
01:58:47,764 --> 01:58:48,822
l'll get it myself.

1062
01:58:50,767 --> 01:58:54,032
Tea.. tea.. tea. Tea
made by the gardener!

1063
01:58:54,103 --> 01:58:56,094
Why are you getting the tea, uncle?
Where are the servants?

1064
01:58:56,372 --> 01:58:59,364
He is your uncle? Uncle,
we are sorry!

1065
01:58:59,442 --> 01:59:01,706
We talked rudely to you.
Ranvir, l'm sorry!

1066
01:59:01,778 --> 01:59:05,236
Doesn't matter, l like you.
l like you very much.

1067
01:59:05,782 --> 01:59:08,376
Why are you standing there Pratap,
give uncle his present.

1068
02:00:14,050 --> 02:00:15,108
What have you done, Pratap!

1069
02:00:18,187 --> 02:00:20,655
l think even l'm destined
to kill somebody.

1070
02:00:46,349 --> 02:00:49,682
Ranvir, why are you
punishing yourself?

1071
02:00:51,688 --> 02:00:54,953
Because those whom l want to
punish are related to me.

1072
02:00:56,693 --> 02:00:58,285
You'll have to respect
those relations.

1073
02:01:01,764 --> 02:01:06,895
l made friends with a man whose
grandpa killed my mother.

1074
02:01:08,371 --> 02:01:09,838
Even you are his grandson.

1075
02:01:10,039 --> 02:01:14,032
lf l could, l'd never be born
as that brute's grandson.

1076
02:01:14,644 --> 02:01:16,703
l'm ashamed of my lineage.

1077
02:01:16,779 --> 02:01:19,111
You are abusing my sister
and my friend.

1078
02:01:19,649 --> 02:01:21,844
A man's deeds have nothing
to do with his lineage.

1079
02:01:22,118 --> 02:01:24,643
Blood! Blood! Blood! What's
wrong with you?

1080
02:01:24,721 --> 02:01:27,918
The words coming from your
mouth have also turned red.

1081
02:01:28,257 --> 02:01:30,316
Don't forget that Ranvir
is your brother.

1082
02:01:30,660 --> 02:01:32,651
l don't accept such
forced relationships.

1083
02:01:32,929 --> 02:01:34,658
You call them forced? Relationships
are determined ..

1084
02:01:34,731 --> 02:01:37,996
..before we're born and it
is our duty to keep them.

1085
02:01:38,067 --> 02:01:40,331
lf my parents death is determined
before l'm born ..

1086
02:01:40,403 --> 02:01:43,065
..then avenging my mother's
death is also determined.

1087
02:01:43,339 --> 02:01:45,136
Talking of revenge
stinks of the past.

1088
02:01:45,208 --> 02:01:47,199
Talk about today,
we are the present.

1089
02:01:47,276 --> 02:01:48,800
But we have to pay our past debts.

1090
02:01:49,145 --> 02:01:54,276
Forget the past. Light a lamp of
friendship, spread brightness.

1091
02:01:54,350 --> 02:01:58,081
No Vijaya. There is no
way l can return now.

1092
02:01:58,955 --> 02:02:00,286
There is only one option.

1093
02:02:01,691 --> 02:02:04,091
l have to avenge my mother's death.

1094
02:02:04,293 --> 02:02:06,955
l can never forgive my father's
murderer, Sapana.

1095
02:02:14,837 --> 02:02:17,897
- What are you thinking?
- What are you thinking?

1096
02:02:19,242 --> 02:02:20,641
l was thinking that nowadays..

1097
02:02:20,710 --> 02:02:25,170
..the solution to all
problems is death.

1098
02:02:26,182 --> 02:02:28,776
Everything has changed.

1099
02:02:29,652 --> 02:02:32,985
Tell me, are they the same Pratap
and Ranvir whom we knew?

1100
02:02:34,724 --> 02:02:36,988
Until morning, everything
was fine, but now ..

1101
02:02:37,660 --> 02:02:40,652
..they are such staunch enemies
like they were never friends.

1102
02:02:41,330 --> 02:02:44,663
Sapana, if anything happens
to any of them..

1103
02:02:45,668 --> 02:02:48,193
..who will cry on whose shoulders?

1104
02:02:49,672 --> 02:02:52,197
Don't say that. Don't say that!

1105
02:03:43,726 --> 02:03:46,923
- l was waiting for you. -
Get out of my way, Ranvir.

1106
02:03:47,663 --> 02:03:51,656
l'm not just a traveler on this
path. l'm your destination.

1107
02:03:52,201 --> 02:03:53,668
No, l'm looking for someone else.

1108
02:03:53,736 --> 02:03:56,933
To reach him, you'll have
to get me out of your way.

1109
02:03:58,741 --> 02:03:59,799
As you wish!

1110
02:05:48,718 --> 02:05:52,711
Ranvir, stop!
- Stop Ranvir!

1111
02:05:53,389 --> 02:05:54,856
Pratap, stop!
- Stop it Pratap!

1112
02:05:56,258 --> 02:05:59,386
- Have you two gone crazy?
- l say stop this battle.

1113
02:06:00,730 --> 02:06:03,790
Victory in this battle
also spells defeat.

1114
02:06:04,133 --> 02:06:05,395
Who is that unfortunate who has..

1115
02:06:06,068 --> 02:06:08,332
..injured you and invited his death?

1116
02:06:09,071 --> 02:06:13,337
Who is he? - He is my father's
illegitimate son, Ranvir.

1117
02:06:15,144 --> 02:06:18,671
Stay out of this, and stay
within your limits.

1118
02:06:19,348 --> 02:06:23,682
l'm sorry father, but l cannot
stay quiet today ..

1119
02:06:24,687 --> 02:06:26,814
..because Ranvir also is
a part of this family.

1120
02:06:26,889 --> 02:06:29,687
Oh no, he is the product of my
father's illicit relationship ..

1121
02:06:29,759 --> 02:06:32,227
..with a cheap woman.

1122
02:06:33,829 --> 02:06:37,959
Whom you are calling a cheap
woman was your father's wife.

1123
02:06:38,701 --> 02:06:40,828
l'm your father's second wife.

1124
02:06:41,904 --> 02:06:47,035
lf anyone is illegitimate,
it is not Ranvir, but you.

1125
02:06:48,844 --> 02:06:51,711
You sacrificed my husband over
your family tradition ..

1126
02:06:51,781 --> 02:06:53,112
- ..yet l kept quiet. - Shut-up!

1127
02:06:54,383 --> 02:06:56,908
You are disgracing our tradition.

1128
02:06:58,120 --> 02:06:59,985
Don't forget who you are talking to.

1129
02:07:00,056 --> 02:07:03,321
l know l'm talking to my
late husband's father.

1130
02:07:04,326 --> 02:07:06,726
But you also don't forget
that you are talking to ..

1131
02:07:06,796 --> 02:07:09,731
..this family's real heir,
Ranvir's Chhoti Ma.

1132
02:07:09,799 --> 02:07:11,198
Daughter-in-law!

1133
02:07:16,005 --> 02:07:17,870
Why did you stop yourself, father?

1134
02:07:19,008 --> 02:07:26,744
lf you weren't my son's widow, your
corpse would be lying here.

1135
02:07:28,217 --> 02:07:29,946
The widows in this family
are corpses, ..

1136
02:07:30,953 --> 02:07:34,150
..the only difference being
that this corpse is talking.

1137
02:07:37,293 --> 02:07:40,228
Daughter-in-law, where
are you going?

1138
02:07:43,833 --> 02:07:46,700
l'm going to meet my
husband's elder son..

1139
02:07:46,769 --> 02:07:48,703
..and your elder grandson, Ranvir.

1140
02:07:56,112 --> 02:07:59,707
Pratap, this battle is not
between you and Ranvir ..

1141
02:07:59,782 --> 02:08:04,185
..it is a battle of
our family tradition.

1142
02:08:05,187 --> 02:08:06,711
Our family tradition.

1143
02:08:07,389 --> 02:08:12,122
lsn't it unfortunate that my
enemy's mother assisted my birth?

1144
02:08:12,194 --> 02:08:15,254
Rajeshwari is your mother too.
You owe your life to her.

1145
02:08:16,065 --> 02:08:17,657
l don't accept this life which
l received in alms..

1146
02:08:17,733 --> 02:08:19,928
..and l don't accept
her as my mother.

1147
02:08:20,803 --> 02:08:22,270
She is only my father's
second wife, that's all.

1148
02:08:22,338 --> 02:08:24,203
Rajeshwari is not a normal woman.
She is like a Goddess.

1149
02:08:24,273 --> 02:08:26,002
She is also the one who
has sired Pratap..

1150
02:08:26,075 --> 02:08:27,201
.. who wants to kill you.

1151
02:08:27,276 --> 02:08:30,677
l killed his father, he has a right
to think that way about me.

1152
02:08:35,284 --> 02:08:39,015
Everybody is right, only
l'm in a dilemma.

1153
02:08:40,089 --> 02:08:41,681
And l see no way out.

1154
02:08:41,757 --> 02:08:45,352
Ranvir, it is those who
are in a Dilemma..

1155
02:08:46,228 --> 02:08:48,025
..whose mothers are not alive.

1156
02:08:49,098 --> 02:08:51,692
l am alive and here for you.

1157
02:08:52,034 --> 02:08:53,092
Chhoti Ma!

1158
02:08:53,903 --> 02:08:57,304
Ranvir, l was waiting for that day..

1159
02:08:58,307 --> 02:09:01,367
..when you'd grow
up and l'd see you.

1160
02:09:02,711 --> 02:09:06,704
But we have met at a time when
this land is once again ..

1161
02:09:06,782 --> 02:09:09,182
..demanding someone's blood.

1162
02:09:10,719 --> 02:09:12,653
lf someone's blood only can
quench this land's thirst, ..

1163
02:09:14,190 --> 02:09:17,785
..it will be my blood
and no one else's.

1164
02:09:19,328 --> 02:09:23,662
Because l want our children to
breath in a new environment.

1165
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:26,797
l'm even ready to give
up my life for it.

1166
02:09:28,737 --> 02:09:34,334
Father!
- Gora Shanker!!

1167
02:09:35,010 --> 02:09:39,743
Why did you stop him? l'd myself
come here to die at his hands.

1168
02:09:41,083 --> 02:09:44,018
Kill me for the sake
of your tradition ..

1169
02:09:45,020 --> 02:09:49,286
..like you killed my sister,
Tara, Phoolmati..

1170
02:09:49,892 --> 02:09:54,352
..my entire clan and even
my friend, Prithvi.

1171
02:09:54,697 --> 02:09:57,689
Don't dare mention my son's name.

1172
02:09:58,968 --> 02:10:04,907
You won that battle because my
son himself invited his death.

1173
02:10:05,307 --> 02:10:07,707
That battle was not between
me and Prithvi.

1174
02:10:08,177 --> 02:10:10,975
That battle was between
you and your son ..

1175
02:10:11,714 --> 02:10:15,309
..which he won, and punished
you and me with life.

1176
02:10:17,653 --> 02:10:19,917
Pratap and Ranvir are
both Prithvi's sons.

1177
02:10:20,656 --> 02:10:22,647
Don't put their lives at stake
for the sake of your tradition.

1178
02:10:23,192 --> 02:10:25,126
Because if anything
happens to them, ..

1179
02:10:25,661 --> 02:10:28,653
..you'll be left alone
with your traditions.

1180
02:10:29,798 --> 02:10:31,663
Let both of them brighten
up your mansion..

1181
02:10:32,001 --> 02:10:33,195
..your pleasure will double.

1182
02:10:33,669 --> 02:10:36,661
Don't dare to merge that
darkness of the past..

1183
02:10:36,739 --> 02:10:38,730
..with the glory of this mansion.

1184
02:10:40,142 --> 02:10:45,739
A sin born to a gypsy woman
cannot be my son's son.

1185
02:10:47,750 --> 02:10:50,947
Don't forget that you are not God,
and even if you were ..

1186
02:10:51,020 --> 02:10:55,218
..l'd kill you for talking
like that about my mother.

1187
02:10:55,291 --> 02:10:58,283
Ranvir, how dare you speak
to your grandpa like that!

1188
02:10:58,827 --> 02:11:00,089
He has ended that relationship..

1189
02:11:00,162 --> 02:11:01,823
..by abusing my mother
today, Chhoti ma.

1190
02:11:02,364 --> 02:11:06,300
l swear by you, l'll not spare
the murderer of my mother.

1191
02:11:06,702 --> 02:11:12,834
lf you dare to say another
word, l'll kill you!

1192
02:11:13,175 --> 02:11:17,635
Then kill me, and try to recognise
the blood that l shed.

1193
02:11:17,980 --> 02:11:21,848
Your blood won't reveal your true
self but your death will.!

1194
02:11:21,917 --> 02:11:24,647
lf your traditions only
demand someone's blood ..

1195
02:11:24,720 --> 02:11:28,656
..let us fight a battle where
my father shed his blood.

1196
02:11:29,124 --> 02:11:32,252
Let us see who loses his life for
the sake of your traditions.

1197
02:11:32,328 --> 02:11:34,853
No Ranvir, we have not come
here to shed blood.

1198
02:11:35,264 --> 02:11:37,789
Ranvir, you challenged my grandpa?

1199
02:11:38,133 --> 02:11:40,658
You want a battle, don't you?

1200
02:11:41,003 --> 02:11:43,995
Then fight a battle with me, battle
should be among equals.

1201
02:11:44,139 --> 02:11:45,197
No, Pratap!

1202
02:11:45,674 --> 02:11:49,667
No son, l've heard these words
in this house 20 years ago.

1203
02:11:50,012 --> 02:11:54,142
Your father had told Shanker that
a war should be among equals.

1204
02:11:54,350 --> 02:11:55,408
lf the outcome of this..

1205
02:11:55,484 --> 02:11:57,008
..battle is going to be
the same, let it be.

1206
02:11:57,686 --> 02:12:02,020
But until l'm alive, a gypsy's
son cannot insult my grandpa.

1207
02:12:02,691 --> 02:12:03,749
That's our tradition!

1208
02:12:04,026 --> 02:12:07,223
Father, break these traditions,
put an end to them.

1209
02:12:07,696 --> 02:12:11,689
No sword can break,
no fire can burn..

1210
02:12:13,168 --> 02:12:16,035
Time can change not only
traditions, but also history.

1211
02:12:16,638 --> 02:12:18,629
Son, at least you listen to me,
please don't fight this battle.

1212
02:12:18,707 --> 02:12:19,765
Let this battle take place..

1213
02:12:19,842 --> 02:12:21,776
..Chhoti ma, only one
of us will die in it.

1214
02:12:22,311 --> 02:12:24,779
Whoever dies, you'll still
have one son alive.

1215
02:12:25,981 --> 02:12:28,108
l'll wait for you, follower
of tradition!

1216
02:12:48,871 --> 02:12:52,329
lsn't this the gun you
used on my father?

1217
02:12:53,876 --> 02:12:57,676
- Yes. - Why is it loaded
only with one bullet?

1218
02:12:59,882 --> 02:13:02,214
Because with only one bullet,..
there is pressure on the shooter

1219
02:13:03,018 --> 02:13:06,283
..because life and death depends
on that one bullet.

1220
02:13:08,023 --> 02:13:11,754
ln such battles, no one is
superior, that's why l'm worried.

1221
02:13:14,163 --> 02:13:18,623
Don't worry uncle, l'll
come to no harm ..

1222
02:13:20,702 --> 02:13:26,299
..because while firing, my parents
blessings will be with me

1223
02:13:29,044 --> 02:13:30,102
And then, l also have
your blessings.

1224
02:13:31,180 --> 02:13:34,980
Look at my helplessness. l'm
indebted to Rajeshwari ..

1225
02:13:35,050 --> 02:13:37,644
..because you owe your life to her.

1226
02:13:39,054 --> 02:13:41,921
But l don't even want
to see Pratap dead.

1227
02:13:44,660 --> 02:13:49,120
You'll have to see one of us dead.

1228
02:13:55,070 --> 02:13:56,128
Fire!

1229
02:15:08,343 --> 02:15:14,680
- Yes, grandpa? - Are you Prithvi's
son or my grandson?

1230
02:15:15,684 --> 02:15:19,677
Grandpa, l only have some
hazy memories of my father.

1231
02:15:20,689 --> 02:15:23,817
My identity comes from
being your grandson.

1232
02:15:24,359 --> 02:15:26,691
- Then promise me. - Promise what?

1233
02:15:27,029 --> 02:15:29,691
Promise me that you won't get
emotional and remove the bullets

1234
02:15:29,765 --> 02:15:32,097
..from your gun like your father..

1235
02:15:32,834 --> 02:15:34,358
..because you are this
family's only heir.

1236
02:15:34,703 --> 02:15:37,763
lf anything happens to you, this
family will have no heir.

1237
02:15:38,173 --> 02:15:41,904
Promise me! - l promise you This
family will not lose it's heir.

1238
02:15:42,311 --> 02:15:43,369
Bless you, son!

1239
02:15:52,921 --> 02:15:53,979
Chhoti Ma!

1240
02:15:54,990 --> 02:15:57,720
l'm not a mother who has come to
ask for something from her son.

1241
02:15:57,993 --> 02:15:59,051
Why are you saying that?

1242
02:15:59,728 --> 02:16:01,855
l may have helped in your birth.

1243
02:16:03,732 --> 02:16:06,724
But you missed out on parental love.

1244
02:16:07,869 --> 02:16:09,928
Neither the pleasures of life
to which you were entitled to.

1245
02:16:15,877 --> 02:16:16,935
l don't know what will
happen tomorrow.

1246
02:16:18,814 --> 02:16:20,679
Only this night is
left in between ..

1247
02:16:21,750 --> 02:16:23,684
..which is also fast running out.

1248
02:16:29,358 --> 02:16:31,155
Tell me what l can do for you.

1249
02:16:37,232 --> 02:16:38,824
l want your blessings, Chhoti Ma.

1250
02:16:57,719 --> 02:16:58,777
May you live long!

1251
02:17:14,736 --> 02:17:17,671
Mother, l have come to
seek your blessings.

1252
02:17:19,675 --> 02:17:21,666
l have already given my blessings..

1253
02:17:21,743 --> 02:17:24,803
..for a long life to
your elder brother.

1254
02:17:25,881 --> 02:17:29,146
l have come to be blessed for
a victory, not a long life.

1255
02:17:31,219 --> 02:17:33,687
No son, today, the blessing
of victory..

1256
02:17:33,755 --> 02:17:37,282
..is connected to living long.

1257
02:17:41,029 --> 02:17:44,089
Alright, l'll go without
your blessings.

1258
02:17:54,042 --> 02:17:57,978
O God, l want to see
both of them alive!

1259
02:18:00,115 --> 02:18:02,709
l want to see both of them alive.

1260
02:18:04,052 --> 02:18:05,110
What kind of a mother are you?

1261
02:18:05,987 --> 02:18:08,717
l'm that mother whose one among..

1262
02:18:08,790 --> 02:18:11,725
..her two sons is sure to die today.

1263
02:18:12,861 --> 02:18:14,726
She has no blessings left.

1264
02:18:17,332 --> 02:18:19,197
But don't worry about Pratap.

1265
02:18:20,736 --> 02:18:23,261
He is protected by his
family tradition.

1266
02:18:23,338 --> 02:18:26,933
Daughter-in-law! Don't
try my patience.

1267
02:18:28,009 --> 02:18:29,203
Don't say another word.

1268
02:18:29,678 --> 02:18:33,671
l have stayed quiet for long,
but not any more ..

1269
02:18:34,883 --> 02:18:39,286
..because, whether Pratap dies
in this battle or Ranvir ..

1270
02:18:40,956 --> 02:18:42,685
..it will be one of your
grandsons who will die.

1271
02:18:43,692 --> 02:18:48,891
Come and watch how it feels when
your kin, battle each other.

1272
02:24:18,293 --> 02:24:19,351
My son!

1273
02:24:21,096 --> 02:24:25,692
Prithvi, my son!

1274
02:24:30,038 --> 02:24:33,701
Call me father just once,
son, just once!

1275
02:24:34,776 --> 02:24:37,711
- Father! - My son!

1276
02:24:38,847 --> 02:24:41,714
- Father! - Forgive me, son.

1277
02:24:41,783 --> 02:24:43,045
Grandpa!

1278
02:24:43,118 --> 02:24:44,779
Forgive me, son.

1279
02:24:46,721 --> 02:24:47,779
Forgive me, son. - Grandpa.

1280
02:24:48,189 --> 02:24:49,850
Forgive me, son. - Grandpa.

1281
02:24:52,927 --> 02:24:53,985
Daughter-in-law.

1282
02:24:55,797 --> 02:24:58,857
A lot of blood has been
shed in this place.

1283
02:24:59,400 --> 02:25:03,734
No more blood will be shed here.

1284
02:25:05,140 --> 02:25:10,737
Put an end to this tradition
of hatred forever.

1285
02:25:11,212 --> 02:25:12,679
Forever!

1286
02:25:22,357 --> 02:25:26,691
Each and every drop
of blood will show..

1287
02:25:26,761 --> 02:25:29,753
..it's true colour sometime.

1288
02:25:30,698 --> 02:25:35,692
Each and every drop
of blood will show..

1289
02:25:35,770 --> 02:25:37,897
..it's true colour sometime.

1290
02:25:39,040 --> 02:25:50,918
Every drop of blood.. has
the blood of storms

1291
02:25:51,386 --> 02:25:54,981
This thirsty earth..

1292
02:25:55,723 --> 02:25:58,920
..demands blood of innocents

1293
02:25:59,727 --> 02:26:03,720
lt is not water

1294
02:26:03,798 --> 02:26:07,996
lt is blood of humans

1295
02:26:09,737 --> 02:26:15,141
Ranvir, we have embraced as
friends several times before.

1296
02:26:15,944 --> 02:26:17,878
Won't you embrace me As
your brother today?

1297
02:26:21,683 --> 02:26:25,210
Ranvir, you are the elder
son of this family.

1298
02:26:26,821 --> 02:26:28,812
You can't leave us like this and go.

1299
02:26:57,185 --> 02:27:00,052
This is era of youthfulness..

1300
02:27:00,989 --> 02:27:03,787
This is a song of
crazy people like us..

1301
02:27:04,392 --> 02:27:07,725
We are the sunshine
of this new era..

1302
02:27:07,795 --> 02:27:11,060
Forget everything which is past..

1303
02:27:11,332 --> 02:27:13,994
This is era of youthfulness..

1304
02:27:14,802 --> 02:27:17,202
This is a song of crazy
people like us..

1305
02:27:18,139 --> 02:27:21,267
We are the sunshine
of this new era..

1306
02:27:21,809 --> 02:27:24,676
Forget everything which is past..
