1
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,001
Every story needs a beginning.

2
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:25,338
The great epic Ramayana was
started by the Sage Valmiki.

3
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:30,804
When sage Sutha narrated a story to
his disciples, the Mahabharatha began.

4
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:36,605
This story began on a rainy evening on
the terrace of Mr. Viswanath's house

5
00:00:41,299 --> 00:00:46,071
There is nothing more ill fortune than
being father of a daughter.

6
00:00:48,166 --> 00:00:51,536
Everyone speaks about the mother who carries
child for 9 months in her womb.

7
00:00:52,266 --> 00:00:57,337
No one speaks of a father who fulfills
her needs from her birth to marriage

8
00:01:00,533 --> 00:01:04,336
Girls... cry when they are born.

9
00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:06,934
but make us cry when they
Ieave after marriage.

10
00:01:08,833 --> 00:01:10,534
When a girl is born...

11
00:01:11,233 --> 00:01:15,236
you enjoy when she is playing
in your lap.

12
00:01:16,666 --> 00:01:19,301
When she is 16 years and she is
walking beside you

13
00:01:19,966 --> 00:01:21,834
and when guys stare at her...

14
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:30,807
You feel proud to be
the father of such a beauty.

15
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,268
l wasn't happy when a son
was born to me.

16
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,869
But, before 19 years...
on a night like this.

17
00:01:40,833 --> 00:01:44,269
When l was sitting in veranda of
Mission Hospital l heard a cry.

18
00:01:45,666 --> 00:01:49,336
That cry changed my whole life...
Anjali was born...

19
00:01:50,533 --> 00:01:56,739
l didn't know how time passed away...
with her Farex box, school bag...

20
00:01:58,099 --> 00:02:01,803
When she was 8 years l bought
her an ice cream.

21
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,337
She asked ''Daddy, if l want an ice-
cream everyday, how much must you earn?''

22
00:02:09,166 --> 00:02:12,469
The next year l bought an ice-cream
parlour beside her school.

23
00:02:14,166 --> 00:02:20,005
Then l decided... if she has to be
free of difficulties...

24
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:25,004
l had to earn money...
and l earned millions.

25
00:02:27,166 --> 00:02:30,836
Every year l gift her
on her birthday

26
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:32,801
Even last year l gifted her...

27
00:02:34,133 --> 00:02:39,738
But l never expected that it would
change our lives upside down.

28
00:03:07,233 --> 00:03:10,769
How is your gold coloured fish?
- How d'you know l was near the aquarium?

29
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:13,969
l know you from the day you were
in your mother's womb

30
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:17,903
Even Anju knows where her daddy is...
- Where am l?

31
00:03:18,033 --> 00:03:22,003
ln Delhi. You are back to hotel from
meeting and calling from your room...

32
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,069
After the meeting, returned to
Hyderabad by a flight...

33
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:32,004
l'm standing just below the window of
your room and speaking to you...

34
00:07:28,266 --> 00:07:30,001
Give her your blessings.

35
00:07:37,466 --> 00:07:39,801
What did you bless her?
- She should be married soon.

36
00:07:40,233 --> 00:07:43,169
Bless her to clear her exams,
marriage can be done in four hours

37
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,669
Even exams are the same its
get over in three hours

38
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:56,502
Well, where were you last night, when
we had been to your room to wish?

39
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,669
You were with him! What you would've
Iost if you had informed us the same.

40
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,001
Then what would you do?

41
00:08:04,133 --> 00:08:06,134
Could have been part of your
happiness. Nothing else!

42
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,403
Only wishes.....no gifts for her?
- Are we given any chance for it?

43
00:08:10,533 --> 00:08:13,602
Last year l thought of gifting her
cycle, daddy gifted her Scooty

44
00:08:13,733 --> 00:08:16,202
This year l thought of gifting an
helmet, but he gifted her a car

45
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,168
How about next year?

46
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,934
No matter what l shouldn't be
sentimental about such things.

47
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:23,335
You can challenge me in all
matters except Anjali's

48
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:27,003
Because no one can love
her like how l do

49
00:08:27,133 --> 00:08:30,603
Why not? My son is there
- Your son is superb in all matters

50
00:08:30,733 --> 00:08:34,269
l've already paid you for the month
- l expected a raise in next salary

51
00:08:46,733 --> 00:08:49,001
ls he there?
- Is it madam

52
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,302
What is it?
- Tell him to send Rs.1000 with you.

53
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:57,435
Rs.1000... He is not here.

54
00:08:58,466 --> 00:09:04,538
Always about money, to give instantly
is it Rs. 1 or 2 its Rs. 100O

55
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:07,335
You are the owner of such big shop
and thinking to give Rs.100O

56
00:09:07,466 --> 00:09:12,170
Big! Shop is like a talcum box
and loan is like a oil drum.

57
00:09:12,299 --> 00:09:14,268
Will my ancestors come and
repay the loan?

58
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:15,501
Are they staying nearby?

59
00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:22,467
What do you need?
- 1 kilo of cashew.

60
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,202
Customers like you should
begin my day...

61
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:29,603
rather than customers who
come for petty items

62
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,002
Service is very fast.
- Even the quality is good.

63
00:09:33,133 --> 00:09:35,535
Can you give me the change?
- Can you pay me before that?

64
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:38,001
Hasn't you son given it?
- If you buy, why should he pay?

65
00:09:38,133 --> 00:09:39,200
Because l've paid him already.

66
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:44,003
He took Rs.300 from me and told me
to try the new stock of cashew

67
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:50,336
Got shocked. If l show the game
you will faint

68
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:57,271
This is billiards table, If my owner
see cards on this l'll be fired.

69
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,003
You are speaking so cheap
about our National game.

70
00:10:03,133 --> 00:10:06,803
l think hockey is National game?
- l think you owe me Rs.100.

71
00:10:06,933 --> 00:10:09,268
lts enough play now?
- What is the bet?

72
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:10,400
My bet is Rs.30O

73
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:26,804
He has _o 'Jacks' and one 'Ace'
- How do you know?

74
00:10:26,933 --> 00:10:28,701
Look at his spectacles

75
00:10:31,466 --> 00:10:32,867
What a brainy guy you are!

76
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:39,937
Forget our cards. Skilled men say,
see opponent's cards first

77
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:42,400
You'll definitely win

78
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:56,400
Rs.500
- Where is it?

79
00:10:57,266 --> 00:11:01,336
l'll give it when you win.
He doesn't know we'll be the winners

80
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,034
Show the cards
- First you show the cards.

81
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:05,535
You might be shocked.
- l can withstand.

82
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
You may leave now.

83
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,001
We know the remaining cards.

84
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:32,501
You should have only one Ace.
How do you know?

85
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,935
We saw it in your glasses
- In this...?

86
00:11:36,066 --> 00:11:38,802
lt shows always the same. These are
called gambling glasses

87
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:41,668
Check it out.
- Let me see it.

88
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:47,937
This is cheating, What do you say?
- Why is he here?

89
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:59,268
Please wait for a second, daddy...
Wait l'll repay.

90
00:12:00,466 --> 00:12:03,602
Listen to me daddy, had been to
Iate night movie.

91
00:12:03,733 --> 00:12:07,403
l was gambling and l lost
Rs.300 in an hour.

92
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,405
l took coaching from him all night
and started to play here.

93
00:12:14,533 --> 00:12:15,600
How much is the profit?
- Rs. 50O

94
00:12:15,733 --> 00:12:17,801
Where is it?
- Not for me, it's for him.

95
00:12:21,533 --> 00:12:24,002
ldiot, waste fellow
- Tomorrow l'll come and we'll play.

96
00:12:25,066 --> 00:12:28,936
Daddy please wait.
- You hit the teacher for a chocolate

97
00:12:29,066 --> 00:12:31,668
Cut hair of your classmate's for a
tiffin in your high school

98
00:12:31,799 --> 00:12:36,504
Till date have you done outlast
one thing to please me?

99
00:12:36,633 --> 00:12:41,270
Why don't you die and go to hell?
- We shall discuss this in the house.

100
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:44,736
Do you have prestige also?
Look like rogue with that band?

101
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,137
The big shop of your father's is
set up with a loan of Rs. 15 lakhs

102
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:53,503
You are an extra debit for it.
- We shall discuss it in the shop

103
00:12:53,633 --> 00:12:57,803
Discuss? l'll decide today... whether
to keep you in the house or not

104
00:12:57,933 --> 00:13:00,268
Daddy please don't make me wild
- What will you do?

105
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:03,603
Come home in the evening...
l'll show you

106
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:11,402
Come and have dinner?
- Come on father lets have dinner.

107
00:13:11,533 --> 00:13:12,600
What is the day today
- Saturday?

108
00:13:12,733 --> 00:13:14,668
Do l eat anything on Saturdays'?
- No

109
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:16,001
What do l drink?
- Milk.

110
00:13:16,133 --> 00:13:18,134
Then why did you call me for dinner?
- She is a fool!

111
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:20,601
You come now.
- How about brother?

112
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:24,303
You are wrong. Ask him if he knows
anything else apart from eating?

113
00:13:24,433 --> 00:13:27,736
lf you yell at him like this, one day
he'll not come to the house

114
00:13:28,066 --> 00:13:30,468
l'm just waiting for that day.
- Are you a human?

115
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,202
You are not bothered that he has
slept without having food?

116
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:36,369
He doesn't starve. He would
have had something outside.

117
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,934
Since evening, he hasn't
been anywhere.

118
00:13:38,066 --> 00:13:39,333
Then he would have had sufficient
in the afternoon.

119
00:13:39,466 --> 00:13:41,668
But you can never accept
that he is starving.

120
00:13:41,799 --> 00:13:44,068
Why can't you accept that nothing
happens to him if he skips a meal

121
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Get me milk.

122
00:13:55,133 --> 00:13:57,268
What happened?
- l'm feeling hungry

123
00:13:57,399 --> 00:14:00,669
Shall l serve you food?
- No l don't want. He is in the hall

124
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:04,737
lf l go there, he'll start his lecture
regarding my studies. He is a pain.

125
00:14:04,866 --> 00:14:08,603
He says for your own good, right?
- He can say it in a better way.

126
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,001
Leave it. Well, may l have
little milk.

127
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:27,403
Anything that you give is so tasty
- Ask directly that you need more.

128
00:14:35,899 --> 00:14:37,401
Why to leave so little?
l'll drink the remaining.

129
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,802
Am l drinking more?
- Why are you saying so?

130
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:52,001
Atleast if you read main sheet, your
general knowledge will improve.

131
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,869
You are reading since 30 years...
to worsen your eye sight.

132
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,001
Will you have butter milk?
- l asked for milk...

133
00:14:57,133 --> 00:14:59,602
After 15 minutes you are asking me to
have butter milk? You have brains?

134
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:01,167
l have brains, but there is no milk.

135
00:15:01,299 --> 00:15:04,136
What happened? Did the cat drink?
- No, l drank.

136
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:08,202
You've drank half a litre of milk?
You've a stomach or bottomless pit?

137
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:11,135
You were asking what will do right?
Now see what l've done.

138
00:15:11,266 --> 00:15:16,170
Now you can't sleep without milk.
Until morning can't expect milkman.

139
00:15:16,299 --> 00:15:20,737
Don't challenge me.
- People starve in anger. But you?

140
00:15:20,866 --> 00:15:24,803
l am not like others.
Hence l changed.

141
00:15:24,933 --> 00:15:27,802
l am angry and you need to starve

142
00:15:29,266 --> 00:15:33,169
ln which star was he born? Who ever
marries him will have a tough life

143
00:15:41,566 --> 00:15:44,669
Play for half an hour and have one
kilo fruits is it called dieting

144
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:50,605
but your son has more than him
after watching the game

145
00:15:54,933 --> 00:15:56,801
You lost it daddy.

146
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:01,736
Did you enquire about college for her?
- Wesley college is better daddy.

147
00:16:01,866 --> 00:16:04,935
Nobody from that college has prospered.
- Even l am from the same college

148
00:16:05,066 --> 00:16:07,201
That is why l am saying to try in
St. Joseph. Is it Okay for you?

149
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:10,869
As you wish.
- Its too far from office and home

150
00:16:11,066 --> 00:16:13,435
Good, then join your wife there.
- Daddy

151
00:16:13,733 --> 00:16:15,601
What is the quarrel?
- Nothing

152
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:19,069
Why should you ask me when you
have already decided?

153
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:24,805
We may ask a person how was the movie.
But do we accept his suggestion?

154
00:16:25,799 --> 00:16:27,067
Then you don't value my decisions?

155
00:16:27,799 --> 00:16:31,270
That's what l like about you, Though
you delay, you understand what l mean.

156
00:16:48,266 --> 00:16:51,302
What are you staring so badly?
- English lecturer is so handsome.

157
00:16:51,433 --> 00:16:52,934
Don't speak like that.
- Why?

158
00:16:53,066 --> 00:16:58,871
l love him.
- Instead of him, love to study.

159
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,872
Let's go. He is so jealous of him.
Jealousy? Why people are like this?

160
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,668
Move aside.
- Who is this idiot?

161

00:17:11,266 --> 00:17:16,270
What can you do if l look so young?
Are you studying from now itself?

Man wears underwear and then pant over it.
Superman wears pant, then underwear over it.

00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,203
Now, am l man or superman?

172
00:17:38,266 --> 00:17:39,667
Why?

173
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,400
My car...

174
00:17:57,599 --> 00:18:02,604
Hope no one has seen this.
- Can't you see and drive?

175
00:18:02,733 --> 00:18:06,169
l understand if it would've happened
on the road.You've hit a parked car?

176
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:11,937
lt is hardly a week old. l shouted

177
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,534
Sorry? Now what shall l do for
these broken lights?

178
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:20,936
lf you hear to my problems,
your heart will break.

179
00:18:21,066 --> 00:18:22,400
What are your great problems?

180
00:18:22,533 --> 00:18:25,002
My mother was sick. In the
hospital, she was tested...

181
00:18:25,133 --> 00:18:29,871
My father had a heart attack
Iooking at the bills.

182
00:18:30,866 --> 00:18:31,933
Then doctor suggested for
bypass surgery.

183
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,336
What'll l do when l'm
just doing my degree

184
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:39,135
Seeking help l am here in college.

185
00:18:39,266 --> 00:18:45,005
Then l thought l know that lady and...
this happened

186
00:18:47,433 --> 00:18:53,071
Don't feel so bad. l said
things unknowingly.

187
00:18:55,566 --> 00:18:58,902
We'll just change the
bulbs for Rs.300.

188
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:04,537
lsn't it? Then why did you yell at me?
- You cried because l yelled at you?

189
00:19:04,666 --> 00:19:07,802
l cried to stop your yelling.
Then... father... heart attack...

190
00:19:07,933 --> 00:19:11,002
lt happens only for person with heart
My daddy doesn't have that chance.

191
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:16,270
By the way... what did you say...?
'' Can't you see?''

192
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,535
You think driving this is easy?

193
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:22,870
Hold clutch, engage the gear, accelerate
control the handle, see girls...

194
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,503
Some times when we apply breaks...it
takes time for the vehicle to stop.

195
00:19:28,566 --> 00:19:29,566
What's your name?

196
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,668
Geetanjali? Swarnanjali?
- Only Anjali.

197
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:35,936
You know who l am?
- l joined just 10 minutes before.

198
00:19:36,066 --> 00:19:39,335
Though you have joined 10 minutes
back, l know your name.

199
00:19:39,533 --> 00:19:43,403
l am studying here since 2 years still
you don't know my name is Rishi?

200
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,535
Now let's move.
- Where to?

201
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:51,870
After getting such a shock...
we need to have coffee

202
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:02,768
Do you eat idli?
One plate idli.

203
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:07,003
Dosa?
Get me one dosa

204
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:09,334

205
00:20:09,466 --> 00:20:12,335
Get me a plate upma
Coffee?

206
00:20:12,466 --> 00:20:16,870
Yes. One coffee
- Why coffee for girls? Get ice-cream.

207
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,801
Had your lunch?
- Yes l had.

208
00:20:18,933 --> 00:20:22,936
That's why you aren't hungry.
l've had it 2 hours ago.

209
00:20:28,733 --> 00:20:31,001
Place everything here.
Even that too.

210
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:17,801
Why are you staring at me?
Pay the bills

211
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Why? You don't have money?

212
00:21:21,166 --> 00:21:23,167
Are you the daughter of car's
driver or the owner?

213
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:27,203
The car is mine.
- Then you must have money. Take out

214
00:21:32,366 --> 00:21:34,835
lt is enough for tips...
who will pay for bill?

215
00:21:34,966 --> 00:21:38,436
l've only this much.
- Why do you come without money?

216
00:21:38,566 --> 00:21:43,003
Daddy buys everything for me.
- Now who'll pay the bill?

217
00:21:47,333 --> 00:21:52,071
l had seen in movies, but l'm
surprised it is happening to me

218
00:21:56,599 --> 00:21:59,736
Though you are so thin, you want to
lift all those plates at once

219
00:22:01,099 --> 00:22:03,502
You saved me from washing those.

220
00:22:15,466 --> 00:22:18,802
lt's you...
What happened...?

221
00:22:23,466 --> 00:22:25,935
You have really come?
- Why are you asking like this?

222
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:31,471
Since you were absent for 2 days, l
was habituated to recall your words

223
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:34,536
l thought even now it was the same.
- You waited for me so eagerly?

224
00:22:35,333 --> 00:22:39,837
Person who fights is called fighter,
and l'll wait hence l'm a best waiter

225
00:22:42,866 --> 00:22:43,866
Shall we have a cup of coffee

226
00:22:45,066 --> 00:22:47,401
Who is it?
- For yesterday's incident.

227
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:53,670
What happened?
- Yesterday, he took me to have coffee

228
00:22:54,266 --> 00:22:59,237
With coffee, he had light tiffin.
Bill was Rs.20O

229
00:23:01,066 --> 00:23:04,335
But l didn't have money...
- Then Rishi must have paid it.

230
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:08,169
lf he would've paid l would say
thank you and not sorry.

231
00:23:08,299 --> 00:23:10,535
Yes, Why did you say?
- Do we need to discuss those?

232
00:23:11,799 --> 00:23:16,604
Please leave from here.
- He couldn't pay, hence washed dishes

233
00:23:16,733 --> 00:23:20,403
You, washed the dishes?
- l didn't wash, l just lifted them.

234
00:23:28,533 --> 00:23:31,535
l have brought my purse today,
shall we have coffee...?

235
00:23:31,666 --> 00:23:33,601
l am busy at some work...

236
00:23:50,133 --> 00:23:54,403
What's the confusion?
- l am scared

237
00:23:54,533 --> 00:23:59,504
ln my lifetime l've done lots of these
experiments and have taught too

238
00:23:59,633 --> 00:24:03,003
Now when you mix these _o chemicals
smoke will be generated.

239
00:24:03,133 --> 00:24:06,870
Don't worry everything will be
alright when the smoke clears

240
00:24:27,266 --> 00:24:30,535
Calm down, troubles do come
for humans not for trees

241
00:24:30,666 --> 00:24:35,003
lts finished
- If you don't stop l'll start crying.

242
00:24:36,166 --> 00:24:41,604
Look how much he is hurt, from
_o years he is behind Priya

243
00:24:41,733 --> 00:24:45,736
Sorry it's three years. Only for
Rs.200 you made him lose his prestige

244
00:24:45,866 --> 00:24:50,604
What sin had he done to you?
- My life is spoilt,don't yell at her

245
00:24:52,133 --> 00:24:54,268
Look that is called as greatness
Is that there is you.

246
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:57,135
Aren't you ashamed to ask a
guy to pay the bill

247
00:24:57,266 --> 00:25:00,402
lf he washes the plate, you want to
publish that in the newspaper

248
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,403
Are those details required now?
- It was casual, don't stop crying.

249
00:25:05,866 --> 00:25:12,272
He is only crying, If it was me then
l would have committed suicide.

250
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,568
l will kick you.
- Sorry l over acted.

251
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:18,470

You've to abide the rules.

Within six months you should love
somebody or help others to love

00:31:01,633 --> 00:31:04,369
By the way, what happened to the
connecting road contract?

291
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,301
lt's difficult to get it.
- Why?

292
00:31:06,433 --> 00:31:08,635
Factually, expenses for that
contract is 20 millions

293
00:31:08,766 --> 00:31:11,301
But the opponent's tender
is for 15 millions.

294
00:31:11,433 --> 00:31:14,335
Their aim is to snatch contract from
us though they are at loss.

295
00:31:15,366 --> 00:31:18,035
Then our tender will remain same.
- We'll not get it.

296
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:19,900
What are they saying?

297
00:31:20,566 --> 00:31:23,969
Though they are at loss, we should
not make any profit.

298
00:31:24,099 --> 00:31:25,100
What am l saying?

299
00:31:25,366 --> 00:31:29,036
Though we don't make any profit, they
must be at loss. Put the tender.

300
00:31:31,033 --> 00:31:34,169
A person by named Rangarao
- He has an appointment.

301
00:31:35,233 --> 00:31:36,233
Send him inside
- Okay sir.

302
00:31:37,033 --> 00:31:39,235
Who is he?
- A marriage broker.

303
00:31:43,566 --> 00:31:47,770
Hello sir, you know businessman
Satya Narayan Rao, his...

304
00:31:48,066 --> 00:31:49,066
Tell me the matter?

305
00:31:51,033 --> 00:31:57,172
His grandson Kumar saw your
daughter in a marriage and ...

306
00:31:57,299 --> 00:32:00,970
What is he?
- He is a sof_are engineer in US.

307
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:05,236
He earns in millions, owns
a big bungalow also

308
00:32:05,366 --> 00:32:07,234
Where?
- In US

309
00:32:07,366 --> 00:32:08,900
His parents?
- They are there.

310
00:32:09,033 --> 00:32:11,301
ln US?
- No they stay in India.

311
00:32:12,166 --> 00:32:15,969
He visits them often
- Why should he?

312
00:32:16,099 --> 00:32:21,305
When he wants to see them, he arranges
for their visa and air tickets

313
00:32:21,433 --> 00:32:24,302
So that it will match his
status and prestige

314
00:32:26,366 --> 00:32:29,102
We should go and see our parents
and god in temple

315
00:32:29,366 --> 00:32:32,302
lts foolish to expect
them to come to us

316
00:32:33,966 --> 00:32:38,704
He doesn't have time for his parents,
how'll he have time for his wife?

317
00:32:38,833 --> 00:32:44,705
l don't want to stand in a queue for
visa just to see my daughter.

318
00:32:46,233 --> 00:32:49,169
l know what kind of husband my
daughter needs, you may leave now

319
00:32:53,466 --> 00:32:54,567
Atleast have a look at his photo?

320
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:58,570
l told you right? Anjali's fiance is
already decided, you may leave.

321
00:33:07,633 --> 00:33:12,104
You look busy, l'll come later
- No, what's more important than you?

322
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:18,303
Pickles, 12 bottles
- Keep that 12th bottle in the shelf

323
00:33:18,433 --> 00:33:21,636
l overlooked in a hurry.
- Its your habit to overlook.

324
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:30,240
Mango pickles 30, lemon pickles 10
- My hands are paining. Get some tea

325
00:33:30,366 --> 00:33:34,970
We have stove, matchbox, milk powder,
tea powder, and vessel.

326
00:33:35,099 --> 00:33:36,401
Do we have flask?
- Yes we do.

327
00:33:36,533 --> 00:33:39,168
Take that and get 2 cups of tea
- As you wish.

328
00:33:42,633 --> 00:33:45,969
l suggested my father not to open
this, here l can see only old ladies.

329
00:33:46,099 --> 00:33:49,436
lnstead should have started a
beauty parlour.

330
00:33:49,566 --> 00:33:51,367
l would have been there for 24 hours
Ieaving my studies.

331
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:12,301
lts you.
- This shop

332
00:34:13,533 --> 00:34:14,901
Own shop
- No on loan

333
00:34:15,733 --> 00:34:16,900
What do you want to buy?

334
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:19,368
Then Farex?
- Why?

335
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:24,171
lts good for growing kids like you.
- l am not a kid.

336
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:26,068
Then what are you?
- Grown up girl.

337
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:31,068
At a second glance even
she is good looking

338
00:34:37,566 --> 00:34:38,767
Why don't you try this perfume?

339
00:35:59,233 --> 00:36:02,769
What did that girl buy?
- l sold the new perfume to her.

340
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:03,900
That was for men.

341
00:36:06,166 --> 00:36:08,434
Doesn't this open?
- Its doesn't

342
00:36:08,566 --> 00:36:12,036
Why? Is it spoilt?
- No, your father has locked it.

343
00:36:12,166 --> 00:36:15,903
He had only so much trust in you.
- Not me, he suspects you.

344
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:26,636
That's it, break the wickets.
- Then he will be out.

345
00:36:29,966 --> 00:36:32,768
lf you hit ball, it should be lost
- Then the match will be stopped.

346
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:37,570
lt should neatly cross the boundary
- This is okay.

347
00:36:44,699 --> 00:36:48,036
What are you yapping too much?
- Its required for his personality.

348
00:36:48,166 --> 00:36:49,967
All of you are Rishi's fans?
- No we are friends.

349
00:36:50,099 --> 00:36:53,570
Then you are cheering for single run?
- Can we cheer for a century?

350
00:36:53,699 --> 00:36:55,635
Let him make half a century.
- He will make it easily.

351
00:36:55,766 --> 00:36:57,400
ls it a challenge?
- How much is Rishi's score?

352
00:36:57,533 --> 00:36:59,568
Roughly its 45
- l want exact score.

353
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:03,769
He can't make 50, my bet is Rs.2000
- He will make it, my bet is Rs.400O

354
00:37:05,033 --> 00:37:07,568
Hit a four and we can party tonight

355
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:18,501
Rishi is playing excellent.

356
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:40,569
Give me the money?
- How can l? Are you human?

357
00:37:40,699 --> 00:37:43,502
l am in a depression as Rishi's is
out, take it tomorrow morning

358
00:37:44,633 --> 00:37:48,169
Till now you were playing like Sachin,
what happened? Is it a match fixing

359
00:37:51,166 --> 00:37:54,302
Why were you staring at me like that?
- What did l do Rishi?

360
00:37:54,433 --> 00:37:57,569
Weren't you looking at me?
- Every one was looking at you.

361
00:37:57,699 --> 00:38:00,035
Your looks differ from their looks.
-How ?

362
00:38:02,233 --> 00:38:04,168
Stop asking questions to seniors,
you'll not come up in life.

363
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:08,103
My luck is bad.
She looks so lovely.

364
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:11,503
Her looks costed me Rs.4000, her smile
will easily cost me Rs. 40,OOO.

365
00:38:11,633 --> 00:38:12,633
Never will l bet in my life.

366
00:38:22,366 --> 00:38:23,967
You can read after you buy.

367
00:38:24,099 --> 00:38:26,702
Only after reading, l can
decide to buy or not

368
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:31,568
l'll wait outside. Atleast buy one
book after reading so much.

369
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:12,303
Even you are here to buy the books?
- l sell books not buy.

370
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:16,904
May be to meet your friends?
- You'll not leave me, until l tell to

371
00:39:17,033 --> 00:39:20,403
l just asked you for the heck of it.
- You like it if it rains?

372
00:39:20,533 --> 00:39:24,169
Will you buy it for me?
- If you pay, l'll buy anything

373
00:39:25,633 --> 00:39:27,401
Shall we have ice creams?
- Now?

374
00:39:27,533 --> 00:39:31,837
One who eats ice cream while its
raining, he is a romantic fellow

375
00:39:31,966 --> 00:39:33,901
You be here, l'll be back
- Okay

376
00:39:36,366 --> 00:39:37,366
Just okay isn't enough.

377
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:54,836
Come, we'll leave.
- We shall have ice creams and leave

378
00:39:54,966 --> 00:39:59,337
lce creams on a rainy day?
- One who eats ice cream on a...

379
00:39:59,466 --> 00:40:02,702
...rainy day, is a romantic fellow.
- Rishi said this?

380
00:40:03,699 --> 00:40:05,902
How did you know?
- The language isn't yours.

381
00:40:07,833 --> 00:40:09,100
Since how long has he been?

382
00:40:11,233 --> 00:40:13,301
Parlour is close by,
Iet's go there.

383
00:40:29,699 --> 00:40:31,635
How much did you give him?
- Rs.100.

384
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:35,236
Go and give him Rs.100 more...
he could be broke.

385
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:40,902
l didn't expect l'll be having
coffee with you.

386
00:40:41,033 --> 00:40:43,235
You thought l wouldn't come?

387
00:40:43,366 --> 00:40:45,968
No, l thought you weren't
not in the habit of drinking coffee

388
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:03,236
Why are you here? Don't have any work?
- Not us, you don't have any work!

389
00:41:03,366 --> 00:41:06,736
You told her you'll get ice cream
and having coffee with Priya.

390
00:41:06,866 --> 00:41:08,701
Did you give me Rs.100?
- No

391
00:41:08,833 --> 00:41:09,833
Then shut your mouth and be quiet.

392
00:41:09,966 --> 00:41:13,703
After all for Rs.100, you are here
spying with an assistant

393
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:15,034
What is this stupidity of having
ice cream in rains?

394
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:22,371
Men have many things to do, understand
that, don't create scene on roads.

395
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,401
What is it?

396
00:41:25,633 --> 00:41:30,904
lts okay, don't repeat it, go home and
sleep, don't get drenched in rain

397
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:39,507
Don't have ice cream on the way home.
- Gave us enough ice cream, move.

398
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:48,504
Why is he attending first period?
- Topper in quiz of general knowledge.

399
00:41:48,633 --> 00:41:49,967
Really?
- Ravi, come over here.

400
00:41:53,833 --> 00:41:56,068
You are topper in quiz?

401
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:57,767
What was the period of World War Il?

402
00:41:59,366 --> 00:42:02,035
How many people died?
- More than 20 millions

403
00:42:02,166 --> 00:42:04,701
What are their names?
Find out and let us know.

404
00:42:04,833 --> 00:42:07,368
How was the joke?
- Excellent.

405
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:09,168
Who should cut jokes here?
- You

406
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:10,367
Then you?
- should laugh

407
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:13,436
Don't act smart?
- Gentleman is coming.

408
00:42:18,099 --> 00:42:20,969
One minute, he has a doubt
- What is it?

409
00:42:21,166 --> 00:42:28,239
lf actress Preeti Zinta says ''l want
to marry you'' then what would you do?

410
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:35,239
l would say my wife, her hand-writing
is good and make her write a letter...

411
00:42:35,366 --> 00:42:39,503
that 'Nobody is responsible for my
death'. Then kill her and marry Preeti

412
00:42:41,833 --> 00:42:42,833
She is here, get the letter
written from her

413
00:42:47,166 --> 00:42:51,637
Yes its me. My father didn't have
brain so he got me married to you.

414
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:57,504
You want others when you have a
beauty queen like me at home

415
00:42:57,633 --> 00:42:59,968
You cheated me by wearing a
wig on our engagement day.

416
00:43:11,233 --> 00:43:13,101
Just a moment, on that day suddenly
l met Priya there...

417
00:43:13,766 --> 00:43:15,701
l was rude to you yesterday,

418
00:43:23,833 --> 00:43:24,833
She gets angry also.

419
00:43:27,833 --> 00:43:28,900
Get prepared and come to hockey
ground, here is Rs.100O

420
00:44:33,266 --> 00:44:40,139
flWhen l ask you sory 100 times...
smile atleast once"

421
00:44:51,666 --> 00:44:55,336
"Don't get angy...
Don't punish me"

422
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:59,871
"Don't curse me...
Instead forgive mefl

423
00:45:02,866 --> 00:45:06,402
"Is your anger true or...
you are just faking it?fl

424
00:45:06,533 --> 00:45:10,403
"l told you sory...
Can't you forgive me?fl

425
00:45:10,533 --> 00:45:14,336
"l thought you were a kid.
Now l know you are a beauty"

426
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:18,870
"When you wanted to know
why l made you cy"

427
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,036
"l can explain... can
you listen to it"

428
00:46:31,333 --> 00:46:35,270
flSeason changes from summer to winterfl

429
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:38,336
"These changes in weather are pleasant"

430
00:46:39,199 --> 00:46:43,304
fll knew only your smiling face.fl

431
00:46:43,433 --> 00:46:47,870
flWas curious to know other faces,
hence l played with you"

432
00:47:39,733 --> 00:47:43,736
"Your cheeks are red in anger"

433
00:47:43,866 --> 00:47:46,668
"Your looks are killing me"

434
00:47:55,866 --> 00:47:59,869
"Your beauty is so admirable"

435
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,203
"and it is so inviting"

436
00:48:04,266 --> 00:48:07,869
flDon't make such nasty facesfl

437
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,738
"Now it will be your mistake
if you don't forgive mefl

438
00:50:17,766 --> 00:50:20,435
How is the girl?
- Very beautiful

439
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:26,969
Which girl daddy?
- The girl you are looking at.

440
00:50:28,366 --> 00:50:32,436
l am looking at the moon
- Its okay, what is she studying?

441
00:50:33,033 --> 00:50:34,901
Who?
- That girl.

442
00:50:35,966 --> 00:50:41,504
Please daddy
- Don't waste time doing these acts

443
00:50:41,633 --> 00:50:45,770
Tell your feelings to her immediately

444
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:49,370
Else you'll have only love stories
to tell in your old age like me.

445
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:53,503
What happened to you daddy?
- Couldn't study like you

446
00:50:53,699 --> 00:50:56,903
But was in love like you, and feared
to propose her and she got married.

447
00:50:57,033 --> 00:50:59,235
Who is she?
- Your mother.

448
00:51:06,166 --> 00:51:10,503
Remember one thing, If you don't earn
you don't have right to spend.

449
00:51:10,633 --> 00:51:12,968
lf you don't have guts to propose,
you don't have right to love

450
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:26,701
l wanted to say something
to you from many days

451
00:53:28,033 --> 00:53:31,102
But l don't know how to say that?

452
00:53:33,566 --> 00:53:36,936
That is why l have written
everything in this letter.

453
00:53:38,766 --> 00:53:44,838
lf l had money l would have
inscribed it on a gold plate

454
00:53:45,033 --> 00:53:49,103
But what to do, l am poor

455
00:53:50,033 --> 00:53:53,903
l couldn't even spend a million
to write a love letter

456
00:53:57,833 --> 00:53:59,601
lf l have to say in one word

457
00:54:04,333 --> 00:54:05,333
This letter is my liver

458
00:54:06,766 --> 00:54:09,635
Liver is as delicate as a flower.

459
00:54:09,833 --> 00:54:14,571
We can do operation for the heart,
but for liver we can't do anything

460
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:18,834
That is why l call it liver

461
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:24,300
Please by any means...

462
00:54:29,166 --> 00:54:29,900
You should give this to Priya

463
00:54:36,566 --> 00:54:41,837
Take this chocolate... on return
of that... l am feeling shy.

464
00:55:11,833 --> 00:55:16,504
''Priya seeing you has created a
wave of love in my heart''

465
00:55:20,366 --> 00:55:22,568
''That is why l am running
behind you like a dog''

466
00:55:23,366 --> 00:55:27,970
''lf you say no l'll have whiskey and
If you say yes we'll have Coco-Cola''

467
00:55:31,366 --> 00:55:33,434
''Life without you is like a
meal with out salt''

468
00:55:35,766 --> 00:55:37,968
''Swear on you l can't have that meal''

469
00:55:38,099 --> 00:55:39,968
''lf you don't like this letter,
you can scold me or hit me''

470
00:55:40,099 --> 00:55:43,369
''But if you stop talking to me
l'll hang myseIF'

471
00:55:45,966 --> 00:55:48,335
''Though this letter is written
with Reynolds ball pen''

472
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:50,268
''But the refill is filled
with my feelings''

473
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:53,236
''lts not the ink in that,
its a link for our love''

474
00:55:53,366 --> 00:55:58,170
''After writing such a lovely poetry,
l feel shy to give it directly.''

475
00:55:58,300 --> 00:56:00,268
''That is why l gave it to A,, njali
to pass it on to you.

476
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:04,704
''l gave it to her because, her body
has developed but her mind isn't.''

477
00:56:04,833 --> 00:56:07,702
''For a chocolate she'll jump
from the Great Wall of China''

478
00:56:07,833 --> 00:56:10,936
''So when you take this letter don't
forget to give her a chocolate''

479
00:56:15,166 --> 00:56:19,570
''Today's Thursday. At 5 p.m, my mother

l am Anjali's classmate.

509
00:58:41,833 --> 00:58:43,100
Your daughter is beautiful.

510
00:58:44,300 --> 00:58:45,300
She doesn't resemble you at all.

511
00:58:52,033 --> 00:58:53,033
l was tense, hence l
told you the truth.

512
00:59:14,766 --> 00:59:18,903
Where were you? She is waiting for
you since an hour, you sit.

513
00:59:22,166 --> 00:59:26,737
You are...
- She is studying in your college

514
00:59:27,033 --> 00:59:31,137
l have seen her somewhere.
- She told she knows you well.

515
00:59:31,266 --> 00:59:33,768
She might know me.
- She told even you know her well.

516
00:59:36,099 --> 00:59:40,337
Aren't you going for temple today.

517
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:42,168
We'll go to temple and come back.
- Okay.

518
00:59:44,300 --> 00:59:46,168
She has some doubts, clarify them

519
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:53,436
Why are you settling here?
You may leave now.

520
00:59:53,566 --> 00:59:56,635
Why? Any important job?
- Priya will be here any moment

521
00:59:56,833 --> 00:59:58,034
She will not come.
- Why?

522
00:59:58,166 --> 01:00:00,902
Because her body is developed
but her mind isn't

523
01:00:01,233 --> 01:00:05,737
l've heard this dialogue somewhere.
- You have written it.

524
01:00:06,766 --> 01:00:08,634
Did you read that letter?
- Yes l did.

525
01:00:08,933 --> 01:00:11,335
Don't you know it is bad manners
to read others' letters?

526
01:00:11,466 --> 01:00:14,368
Writing ill about me in
Ietters is good manner?

527
01:00:15,300 --> 01:00:17,902
Give me that letter first
- l know what to do with this letter.

528
01:00:21,900 --> 01:00:27,038
We will make an agreement. Give me
the letter and l'll forgive you.

529
01:00:27,833 --> 01:00:30,035
ls it true?
- Don't act too smart.

530
01:00:30,633 --> 01:00:35,971
l've caught you after long time.
What a poetry you have written?

531
01:00:36,099 --> 01:00:37,835
''Priya seeing you has created
a wave in my heart''

532
01:00:41,433 --> 01:00:42,433
Give me the letter.

533
01:02:05,766 --> 01:02:07,167
You aren't believing me right?

534
01:02:07,300 --> 01:02:11,404
You've written a love letter
to Priya and now proposing me?

535
01:02:11,533 --> 01:02:16,337
lt's your wish to believe, l'll tell
you why you need to believe.

536
01:02:17,633 --> 01:02:21,036
There is a mango tree and has
only one mango in it.

537
01:02:21,166 --> 01:02:24,836
lt's out of reach,
what will we do to get it?

538
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,635
We'll look down for a stone
to throw at it.

539
01:02:29,833 --> 01:02:32,502
A person from far will think l'm
Iooking at stone rather than fruit.

540
01:02:32,766 --> 01:02:38,171
Here both fruit and the stone
are equally important

541
01:02:39,766 --> 01:02:42,969
The stone is Priya

542
01:02:45,766 --> 01:02:46,766
You are the fruit

543
01:02:48,833 --> 01:02:50,834
What if l had given the
Ietter to Priya

544
01:02:51,966 --> 01:02:53,767
l knew you wouldn't

545
01:02:58,366 --> 01:03:01,569
lf you love me, you'll
come to know here

546
01:03:06,300 --> 01:03:08,168
Wake me up at 9 a.m tomorrow
- Isn't it too early

547
01:03:08,300 --> 01:03:12,804
lf we don't work in this young age
can we in old age, daddy.

548
01:03:12,933 --> 01:03:15,302
Are you joking?
- No l am serving chapatis

549
01:03:15,433 --> 01:03:18,769
Can't you think anything else
apart from eating

550
01:03:19,099 --> 01:03:21,769
Can't he have food peacefully?

551
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:25,701
Shall l serve you?
- Let Anju come?

552
01:03:25,833 --> 01:03:29,303
She has gone out?
- Haven't you finished dinner yet?

553
01:03:29,433 --> 01:03:34,304
He is waiting for you.
- l'm not feeling hungry.

554
01:03:39,566 --> 01:03:40,566
Serve me?

555
01:03:41,433 --> 01:03:44,169
She has more friends and less
food now-a-days

556
01:04:14,966 --> 01:04:20,805
Why are you here at this time?
- Came to return your ice-cream money

557
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:26,036
Where is the money?
- Its not there now

558
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:32,071
lf you give me a day or _o l'll repay
- Why are you coming near me?

559
01:04:32,199 --> 01:04:35,436
Lets have fun now.
- Aren't you shameless?

560
01:04:35,633 --> 01:04:38,102
Lovers are shameless
- Then Priya

561
01:04:39,900 --> 01:04:43,103
Why do you doubt me so much?
- Not doubt, but fear.

562
01:04:43,699 --> 01:04:49,472
l don't have brains, love chocolates...
if you get bored and leave me?

563
01:04:52,033 --> 01:04:56,370
Crazy! Mummy, pickle and Anjali
can never bore me.

564
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:07,169
lts already 2 a.m?
- In an hour it'll be 3 a.m

565
01:05:08,500 --> 01:05:12,370
lf anyone see us, you've had it!
- That is why l loved you.

566
01:05:13,300 --> 01:05:14,300
Please leave now.

567
01:05:17,566 --> 01:05:20,035
Do you have dog in your house?
- Didn't you see it while coming?

568
01:05:20,300 --> 01:05:23,102
lf l had, l wouldn't have come.
- It'll not do anything. Now leave.

569
01:05:23,300 --> 01:05:26,236
l'll leave after it sleeps
- It'll not sleep now.

570
01:05:26,300 --> 01:05:29,970
Why is it having some health problem?
- l don't know, you leave

571
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:31,901
l am your guest and you
ask me to leave

572
01:06:31,033 --> 01:06:34,169
Can you do me a small help? l'll not
ask you anything in life.

573
01:06:34,300 --> 01:06:37,036
What is it?
- Can you call your dog back?

574
01:06:37,166 --> 01:06:42,137
You are 2 years senior to me and
you are fearing for a dog.

575
01:06:42,300 --> 01:06:48,706
You are getting back at me!
- We call you 'sir' in the college

576
01:06:48,900 --> 01:06:56,374
Not required, l'll call you madam
- What about girlfriends and affairs?

577
01:06:56,500 --> 01:07:00,971
All cut, from tomorrow except you all
the girls in India are my sisters.

578
01:07:01,300 --> 01:07:04,302
Should l carry your bag?
- No, l'll carry yours too..

579
01:07:04,433 --> 01:07:10,172
l request you to call it back.
- Not me, request the dog.

580
01:07:10,300 --> 01:07:14,037
Because it doesn't listen to me.
- Why is it a language problem?

581
01:07:14,166 --> 01:07:19,037
No, it's our neighbors' dog. They are
out of station, hence it is here.

582
01:07:20,300 --> 01:07:21,300
Demon

583
01:07:55,833 --> 01:07:59,636
Then what happened?
- A she-dog saved my life.

584
01:07:59,766 --> 01:08:01,767
Else l would've been discussing the
same with the doctor by now

585
01:08:02,966 --> 01:08:07,704
l never knew you are afraid of dogs so much,
l thought you were just joking.

586
01:08:07,833 --> 01:08:12,637
Joking... to see its face from
near was really horrible

587
01:08:15,099 --> 01:08:16,100
ls this the way to say sorry?

588
01:08:17,966 --> 01:08:20,468
ls this the way to say sorry?
- Then how should l?

589
01:08:22,966 --> 01:08:23,966
ln this way.

590
01:08:25,100 --> 01:08:27,302
Not now.
- Then, when?

591
01:08:27,633 --> 01:08:32,304
Lots of traffic...it isn't good here.
- Then which is a better place?

592
01:08:37,366 --> 01:08:40,569
On the sea shore...
in the moonlight...

593
01:08:40,899 --> 01:08:47,973
The musical waves...
touching our feet...

594
01:08:48,966 --> 01:08:53,403
The moon at far...
you are near me...

595
01:08:54,766 --> 01:08:58,970
The soft, cool breeze...
touching us...

596
01:09:02,699 --> 01:09:03,967
That is the right place

597
01:09:07,133 --> 01:09:13,806
To get the sea to Hyderabad
is difficult, let's go.

598
01:09:25,300 --> 01:09:26,300
l'll be back soon.

599
01:09:41,433 --> 01:09:42,433
Come lets move

Where to Rishi?
- l'll let you know.

602
01:09:55,899 --> 01:09:58,569
Why did you bring me to Airport?
- To board the train!

603
01:09:58,899 --> 01:10:00,901
Where are we going?

604
01:10:01,300 --> 01:10:04,369
You are so curious! You ask one
question in 10 minutes.

605
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:06,301
What time is the flight to Mumbai?

606
01:10:07,300 --> 01:10:11,137
Return flight to Hyderabad?
Two return tickets to Mumbai.

607

''Why should he do all this?''

609
01:10:28,966 --> 01:10:29,966
What's your name?

610
01:10:31,133 --> 01:10:32,033
Where do you want to go?

611
01:10:32,133 --> 01:10:33,133

01:17:48,300 --> 01:17:50,969
lts better than calling your
husband as father-in-law

642
01:17:52,100 --> 01:17:54,602
You don't come out of our bedroom
after removing the contact lens

643
01:17:54,733 --> 01:17:55,733
Did you understand
- Okay

644
01:17:56,100 --> 01:17:58,035
Not there, here
- l am coming.

645
01:17:58,766 --> 01:18:03,504
When your father said she has sight,
l mistook it for site

646
01:18:11,966 --> 01:18:13,701
Any news?
- Nothing special,

647
01:18:13,833 --> 01:18:16,702
Your Madras branch manager, gave me
a parcel to give it to you

648
01:18:17,633 --> 01:18:19,768
At the airport l saw Anjali

649
01:18:20,966 --> 01:18:23,702
before l could give it to her,
she checked in.

650
01:18:23,899 --> 01:18:25,968
So l'll send it to your
office tomorrow.

651
01:18:49,666 --> 01:18:51,234
lts me Anjali's father.

652
01:18:53,899 --> 01:18:57,570
ls Anjali there?
- No, l didn't meet her today.

653
01:19:05,666 --> 01:19:07,901
Where were you?
- l was in Anu's house.

654
01:19:09,733 --> 01:19:13,903
Come, let's have dinner.
l had my dinner there

655
01:19:14,233 --> 01:19:15,901
lt's already late, go to sleep.

656
01:19:45,233 --> 01:19:46,901
Anjali had been to airport
this evening.

657
01:19:47,100 --> 01:19:51,304
l want to know why she was there
and what happened later on.

658
01:19:51,433 --> 01:19:54,235
l'll call you back.
- l shall be waiting for your call

659
01:20:16,033 --> 01:20:18,335
lt's me, sir.
Yes, tell me

660
01:20:18,466 --> 01:20:21,402
At 6.45 p.m, Anjali boarded
Mumbai flight

661
01:20:22,300 --> 01:20:26,070
Got down at 7.45 p.m and spoke
to prepaid taxi

662
01:20:30,300 --> 01:20:35,571
Spoke to the driver. He informed that
they went to furniture shop then,

663
01:20:35,699 --> 01:20:38,302
they took a food parcel from
Sunshine Restaurant then,

664
01:20:38,433 --> 01:20:40,768
they went to Bandra stand,
stayed for 45 minutes.

665
01:20:40,899 --> 01:20:43,435
What did they do?
- Had dinner there

666
01:20:44,166 --> 01:20:46,234
They boarded flight at 9.45 p.m and
reached here by 10.45 p.m

667
01:20:49,733 --> 01:20:50,733
What are the names on tickets?

668
01:21:17,966 --> 01:21:19,767
l told Principal...
- About what?

669
01:21:19,899 --> 01:21:23,770
Get a ball for every one, look how
they are fighting for it.

670
01:21:23,899 --> 01:21:26,902
Fool! It's a game.
- It's a shame to our college.

671
01:21:27,033 --> 01:21:28,367
You'll never prosper in life.
- You came to know about it now.

672
01:21:42,766 --> 01:21:43,766
l want to...

673
01:21:47,166 --> 01:21:52,237
Yes, tell me.
- Not here. Can you come along with me?

674
01:22:35,033 --> 01:22:36,033
What are you doing?

675
01:22:38,566 --> 01:22:43,237
What are plans after your studies?
- l'll marry.

676
01:22:48,233 --> 01:22:51,235
What will you do after that?
- l'll go for honeymoon

677
01:22:51,899 --> 01:22:58,172
After that...?
- Then we'll have kids, then they ...

678
01:22:58,300 --> 01:23:05,573
... grow up, get married, leave for
honey moon and even they'll have kids

679
01:23:07,699 --> 01:23:09,168
l think we wouldn't be
alive by then.

680
01:23:12,233 --> 01:23:14,768
ls there anything else apart from
Iove, marriage, kids?

681
01:23:15,566 --> 01:23:18,835
Do people live in any other way?
- Yes, there is.

682
01:23:19,233 --> 01:23:21,768
Man's life with an ambition is
definitely different

683
01:23:23,166 --> 01:23:25,835
30 years back l came to Hyderabad
with just a suitcase

684
01:23:26,833 --> 01:23:28,834
l sold my wife's ornament and started
business with that money

685
01:23:29,699 --> 01:23:32,636
And earned millions of money.
Don't you have any ambitions?

686
01:23:34,033 --> 01:23:37,169
What's your son?
- He is the M.D of my company.

687
01:23:37,300 --> 01:23:43,239
According to you he has to sell his
wife's ornaments and begin like you

688
01:23:44,899 --> 01:23:47,369
Why do rate others life with
respect to yours?

689
01:23:50,233 --> 01:23:52,501
lf a rickshaw driver becomes
rich and...

690
01:23:52,633 --> 01:23:56,570
lf he buys a new rickshaw for his son,
it's called foolishness!

691
01:23:58,366 --> 01:24:06,373
lf we climb 10 steps, we should expect
our children to start from 1 1 and not 1

692
01:24:08,066 --> 01:24:12,103
Since my daughter likes you and
accompanied you to Mumbai...

693
01:24:12,699 --> 01:24:20,107
l expected you to be intelligent. But
You are a fool and l didn't like you.

694
01:24:20,633 --> 01:24:23,902
lt's alright. Anjali likes me
and that's enough.

695
01:24:24,033 --> 01:24:28,303
No, it isn't. If you love a girl,
just a greeting card isn't enough.

696
01:24:28,899 --> 01:24:32,236
lf you've to marry the same girl then
you have to give wedding cards and

697
01:24:32,633 --> 01:24:35,736
There will be expenses... l think that
you can't bear those expenses.

698
01:24:37,033 --> 01:24:41,237
To love, you need money?
- To live we need it.

699
01:24:41,366 --> 01:24:42,366
How much?

700
01:24:42,500 --> 01:24:46,237
For an ice cream, buy a parlour. For
dinner, buy a restaurant

701
01:24:46,899 --> 01:24:51,371
Can you equal a 48 year old father to
fulfill 18 year old daughter's wish?

702
01:24:55,966 --> 01:25:01,404
l am earning a million everyday,
if you earn just a million...

703
01:25:01,733 --> 01:25:03,301
in your lifetime... l'll get my
daughter married to you.

704
01:25:03,433 --> 01:25:09,238
Else, there's 10 million in this.
Take it and forget my daughter.

705
01:25:47,733 --> 01:25:48,733
Daddy...

706
01:25:50,500 --> 01:25:55,171
l have a written caption for our milk
powder which will increase our sale

707
01:25:55,333 --> 01:25:58,235
Why isn't it making profit? First
Iet me listen then l'll design.

708
01:26:00,233 --> 01:26:05,571
This gives your child everything for
its growth except mother's love.

709
01:26:06,633 --> 01:26:07,633
lt's not good.
- Why?

710
01:26:07,766 --> 01:26:14,172
We are selling milk in the form of
powder, how can't it be mother's love?

711
01:26:14,699 --> 01:26:15,700
Cancel that line.

712
01:26:16,833 --> 01:26:23,239
This provides your children with all
the primary nutrients including love.

713
01:26:26,833 --> 01:26:30,636
What did you do? l'm asking you...
Tell me what's this?

714
01:26:30,766 --> 01:26:33,435
What happened?
Why are you yelling at him?

715
01:26:33,566 --> 01:26:35,634
lf you want me to stop yelling
then ask what he has done?

716
01:26:36,366 --> 01:26:38,501
What has he done?
- Look at this.

717
01:26:40,566 --> 01:26:43,969
He has taken Rs.20,OOO loan keeping
his gold chain in the bank.

718
01:26:44,100 --> 01:26:46,435
They had come in the morning to
collect the interest for the same.

719
01:26:46,566 --> 01:26:47,733
Why you required such huge amount?

720
01:26:50,733 --> 01:26:52,835
You won't speak except while
asking for loan

721
01:26:53,833 --> 01:26:58,704
Got angry? Faster than your anger
is the banker's phone call.

722
01:27:00,300 --> 01:27:04,303
When you earn lakhs of money then
you can afford to spend it happily.

723
01:27:04,433 --> 01:27:06,835
Until then remember, you are spending
your fathers hard earned money.

724
01:27:07,699 --> 01:27:12,237
We look after our kids not
to repay their loans.

725
01:27:12,399 --> 01:27:14,735
You don't have to repay, l'll do it.

726
01:27:42,100 --> 01:27:45,369
You did that to take me
to Mumbai, right?

727
01:27:48,633 --> 01:27:51,235
Why you had to spend so much and...

728
01:27:52,300 --> 01:27:55,770
People who have money may not spend.
One who spends may not enjoy

729
01:27:56,566 --> 01:28:00,770
Every pie that l spent, l felt that
l earned ten times more.

730
01:28:02,500 --> 01:28:04,301
But when your father was scolding...?

731
01:28:05,566 --> 01:28:08,101
l can forget my father's scoldings
in a fraction of a second

732
01:28:09,033 --> 01:28:12,236
But, time spent with you on that
day lives in my heart forever.

733
01:28:20,033 --> 01:28:27,907
lf you don't mind...l am unable to
control my feelings in this.

734
01:28:29,899 --> 01:28:35,238
Because, even l'm a part
of this mistake.

735
01:28:35,899 --> 01:28:39,036
So, this is for your daddy...

736
01:28:48,166 --> 01:28:52,570
Even you are acting like my father,
you didn't feel my heart

737
01:28:55,633 --> 01:28:57,368
l was not hurt so much... even when
my father scolded...

738
01:29:00,566 --> 01:29:04,836
Since l used to ask money from you...
you thought this is just the same?

739
01:29:06,833 --> 01:29:10,303
l wanted to see the happiness in your
eyes, when you look at the sea

740
01:29:10,633 --> 01:29:12,167
l thought l'll do anything
to see that.

741
01:29:12,633 --> 01:29:15,235
But, you rated my feelings... ?

742
01:29:20,366 --> 01:29:26,171
Why did you think like this?
Are all wealthy people like this?

743
01:29:29,233 --> 01:29:32,402
You think my father is heartless, If
l don't pay the money back

744
01:29:32,566 --> 01:29:34,634
He'll throw me out of the house
and you want to save me

745
01:29:34,766 --> 01:29:37,034
l didn't give it for that...
- Then why did you give?

746
01:29:37,733 --> 01:29:41,503
Then, even l'll give all the bills for
the table, dinner, will it be okay?

747
01:29:46,033 --> 01:29:50,771
Till now l felt l was in love with
a beautiful girl but now l feel...

748
01:29:52,033 --> 01:29:55,836
l am in love with a wealthy girl.
l made a mistake.

749
01:30:14,033 --> 01:30:15,234
What is this?
- Board

750
01:30:15,366 --> 01:30:16,366
What is this?
- Road.

751
01:30:16,500 --> 01:30:18,969
How dare you park the vehicle on road
even after reading the board.

752
01:30:19,033 --> 01:30:21,034
Do We need to be 'daring' to park a bike?
l thought stand was enough!

753
01:30:22,233 --> 01:30:23,968
Stop the discussion and pay the fine.

754
01:30:24,100 --> 01:30:25,835
l don't pay my college fees...
then why will l pay the fine?

755
01:30:26,966 --> 01:30:30,636
Give me Rs. 25
- We've just met. How can l lend you?

756
01:30:30,766 --> 01:30:32,701
lt's not loan.
- Then... it's a bribe... ?

757
01:30:32,833 --> 01:30:34,501
Don't shout for that petty
cash of yours

758
01:30:34,633 --> 01:30:37,102
Amount is not important,
the purpose is important.

759
01:30:37,233 --> 01:30:39,902
With receipt is Rs.50, without Rs.25
- Why should we give?

760
01:30:40,033 --> 01:30:45,071
You want bribe for parking,
riding, standing...

761
01:30:45,300 --> 01:30:47,035
ls it a revolution?
No it's pollution.

762
01:30:47,166 --> 01:30:50,168
People like you are just irritation.
l'll throw your vehicle in the station

763
01:30:50,300 --> 01:30:53,736
Tomorrow pay the fine in the Court
and collect your vehicle.

764
01:30:54,500 --> 01:30:59,438
l'll come anywhere for justice.
But l'll not give any bribe to you

765
01:30:59,566 --> 01:31:00,566
What's all this scene about?

766
01:31:00,699 --> 01:31:01,967
He is asking for bribe as it was
parked in no parking zone

767
01:31:02,100 --> 01:31:06,838
lf you say another word l'll kill you
- l am ready to die for justice.

768
01:31:06,966 --> 01:31:10,369
Are you mad? Why do you want to run
around court, station...?

769
01:31:10,500 --> 01:31:13,236
Just give how much he asked for.
- Why should we give for others bike?

770
01:31:14,033 --> 01:31:16,568
So that was...
- It's Giri's bike.

771
01:31:16,699 --> 01:31:18,568
l pity that guy.
- Don't pity that guy.

772
01:31:18,699 --> 01:31:22,170
He refused to lend you Rs.100 now
Iet him pay Rs.500 in Court.

773
01:31:22,300 --> 01:31:24,568
You are very cunning.
- Man should've some good qualities

774
01:31:26,366 --> 01:31:29,736
lt seems... you and Anjali broke up?
- Why are you so happy?

775
01:31:29,866 --> 01:31:32,702
l am just happy, but others
are partying

776
01:31:33,500 --> 01:31:36,769
Anjali, with her family left to temple
to thank God for getting rid of you.

777
01:31:40,966 --> 01:31:42,734
Going home?
- Yes. Will you drop me?

778
01:31:42,866 --> 01:31:43,866
Come.

779
01:31:46,033 --> 01:31:48,702
On the way l have some work, shall
we finish it first?

780
01:31:48,866 --> 01:31:49,866
No problem at all.

781
01:31:58,100 --> 01:32:01,536
Are you taking me to Vizag?
- No.

782
01:32:01,666 --> 01:32:05,102
l just joked. No person with brains
will travel that far on bike.

783
01:32:05,233 --> 01:32:06,500
So we'll just go to Annavaram.

784
01:32:07,733 --> 01:32:09,901
Stop it. l'll go home by walk.
- On the way back, l'll drop you home.

785
01:32:10,033 --> 01:32:13,636
l beg you, please stop it.
- l'll not stop, you can jump off.

786
01:32:13,899 --> 01:32:19,005
There is brake please use it.
- l'll use only accelerator.

787
01:32:19,166 --> 01:32:23,370
l would have brought clothes?
- Its for people who take bath.

788
01:32:24,466 --> 01:32:25,733
Don't be so sentimental,
we'll be back soon.

789
01:32:33,500 --> 01:32:35,635
Do you have your license with you?
- No. Why?

790
01:32:35,766 --> 01:32:38,902
lt's highway, sometimes we may find
R.T.O. officers checking for the same

791
01:32:47,699 --> 01:32:48,834
Stop. Move aside

792
01:32:55,233 --> 01:32:57,568
Do you have license?
Yes, but it is my house.

793
01:32:57,699 --> 01:33:00,169
Then why are on roads without that?
Do you have R.C book?

794
01:33:00,300 --> 01:33:04,237
l have only note books with me.
- Collect the fine from them.

795
01:33:05,833 --> 01:33:07,901
You know great Bogglers.
- l am his son-in-law. Why?

796
01:33:08,033 --> 01:33:09,734
Then give them the fine.
- Take out the money

797
01:33:09,866 --> 01:33:12,702
Not giving any receipt?
- Then you have to wait for 2 hours.

798
01:33:12,833 --> 01:33:17,103
Anyway why do we need receipt?
- Where are you going?

799
01:33:19,500 --> 01:33:24,371
Then do me a favor, take this Rs.100.
Offer this to God in temple.

800
01:33:27,833 --> 01:33:28,833
What's your name?

801
01:33:29,566 --> 01:33:30,900
You will be here tomorrow?
Why?

802
01:33:31,033 --> 01:33:32,234
On the way back we can give you
the pious food offered for God

803
01:33:32,366 --> 01:33:33,366
Okay. Get it.

804
01:33:35,833 --> 01:33:40,904
He took away all the money, if we run
out of petrol then that's it!

805
01:33:41,033 --> 01:33:42,033
Shut your dirty mouth.

806
01:33:58,699 --> 01:34:02,837
Can you ever speak something
good, is it a tongue?

807
01:34:02,966 --> 01:34:04,567
lf l hadn't said that you would've
reached Annavaram in half litre petrol.

808
01:34:04,733 --> 01:34:05,733
l'll kill you.

809
01:34:12,233 --> 01:34:16,570
Don't throw that bottle,
we can fetch petrol in that.

810
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:20,069
lf you don't crush this bottle, they
refill and sell you the same again.

811
01:34:20,199 --> 01:34:21,234
What were you saying?

812
01:34:50,699 --> 01:34:52,234
Oh my god! This is not 'Hero' Honda,
but is a 'villain' Honda.

813
01:34:52,366 --> 01:34:54,634
To maintain this you need
to own a petrol pump

814
01:35:04,366 --> 01:35:05,834
Excuse me
- No rooms.

815
01:35:05,966 --> 01:35:07,667
The watchman told this is a
guest house with 200 rooms.

816
01:35:07,800 --> 01:35:10,169
No rooms means vacant rooms
aren't available.

817
01:35:10,300 --> 01:35:13,836
Excuse me doesn't mean we want rooms
- Then what do you want?

818
01:35:13,966 --> 01:35:16,034
We need some information.
- You'll have to spend.

819
01:35:16,166 --> 01:35:17,767
How much?
Rs. 10O

820
01:35:19,833 --> 01:35:25,572
What to do? Give it.
- Why is money tied in a cloth?

821
01:35:25,699 --> 01:35:29,370
lt was an offering to God.
- If l take it then l'll be sinned?

822
01:35:29,500 --> 01:35:31,068
We don't have any other money
apart from this

823
01:35:31,199 --> 01:35:33,569
You take it back. l'll give you
what ever you ask for.

824
01:35:33,699 --> 01:35:38,838
Can you tell us where is Mr.Viswanath,
great businessman from Hyderabad?

825
01:35:38,966 --> 01:35:41,368
Why will such people stay here?
- Then where do they stay?

826
01:35:41,500 --> 01:35:44,903
Check out in the special cottages
in the next street.

827
01:35:46,566 --> 01:35:48,167
Are you diabetic?
- Yes

828
01:35:48,300 --> 01:35:49,300
Do you have high blood pressure?
- Yes

829
01:35:49,433 --> 01:35:53,236
lf you take bribes, you'll get
cancer and aids also.

830
01:36:03,233 --> 01:36:06,235
What shall we do?
- We'll knock each and every door.

831
01:36:07,566 --> 01:36:10,035
lf we go like this people
will knock us down

832
01:36:10,166 --> 01:36:13,235
Why?
- Have a look. We look like beggars

833
01:36:13,366 --> 01:36:19,572
You look far better. l look like
a thief. If any constable see me...

834
01:36:31,300 --> 01:36:36,838
What ever you speak... it's
turning to be true.

835
01:36:40,366 --> 01:36:44,236
Yesterday night, a necklace was
stolen. Were you the guys?

836
01:36:44,366 --> 01:36:48,236
We aren't robbers. We've seen such
robbery only in movies.

837
01:36:48,366 --> 01:36:49,366
Name?

838
01:36:51,699 --> 01:36:52,700
We don't know your name.
l asked your name, not mine!

839
01:36:56,966 --> 01:36:57,966
Just your name.

840
01:37:00,233 --> 01:37:05,905
l was like a jack fruit in childhood
now, l've retained only size not colour

841
01:37:06,566 --> 01:37:09,135
Why did you come here?
- Bad luck.

842
01:37:12,133 --> 01:37:15,903
l am from Gannavaram, 25 years ago when
we came to perform the ritual here.

843
01:37:16,033 --> 01:37:21,037
l had a _in brother, like the movie
'Hello Brother' My name is Pandu(fruit)

844
01:37:21,166 --> 01:37:22,767
Rai (stone)...
- No its Laddu

845
01:37:22,899 --> 01:37:27,237
When we both had been here, l was on
Ieft, he was on right and in be_een

846
01:37:27,366 --> 01:37:28,667
Your mother
- No, my father was there.

847
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:32,236
We were coming out from the temple
and he snatched the bag away

848
01:37:32,366 --> 01:37:33,900
Your brother
- No, the thief.

849
01:37:34,566 --> 01:37:39,237
l started shouting, 'Father, thief!'
and in the meantime, he ran away

850
01:37:39,366 --> 01:37:40,500
Your father?
- No, my brother.

851
01:37:40,633 --> 01:37:44,370
Thief is ahead, Laddu behind him.
Suddenly he fell down.

852
01:37:44,500 --> 01:37:45,500
The thief?
- No my father.

853
01:37:45,633 --> 01:37:47,501
Why did your father fall?
- He was drunk.

854
01:37:47,633 --> 01:37:50,569
People started hitting him.

855
01:37:50,699 --> 01:37:52,034
The thief?
- No, they hit my father.

856
01:37:52,166 --> 01:37:53,834
Why did they hit your father?
- He looks like a thief

01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:58,501
The thief?
- No, my brother

859
01:37:58,633 --> 01:38:00,701
Why did your brother run away?
- Because he likes running.

860
01:38:01,233 --> 01:38:04,502
Since then every year l come
here in search of him

861
01:38:04,633 --> 01:38:06,201
The thief?
- No, my brother.

862
01:38:06,566 --> 01:38:08,434
Look there
- Your brother?

863
01:38:08,566 --> 01:38:10,234
No, your station.
- Why is that required?

864
01:38:10,366 --> 01:38:13,502
lf he comes to station, give this card.
- To the thief?

865
01:38:13,633 --> 01:38:15,568
No, to my brother, ''l'll kill you''
- Kill me.

866
01:38:15,699 --> 01:38:16,700
Not you him.

867
01:38:31,399 --> 01:38:35,737
ln this mist we can't see anything,
How can you search her?

868
01:38:38,566 --> 01:38:43,637
Where are you dear sister Anjali?
We are roaming here like beggars

869
01:38:45,333 --> 01:38:48,869
flOh my love, l'm searching for youfl

"l am desperate to meet you"

881
01:40:39,033 --> 01:40:42,703
"People pity me seeing my state"

882
01:40:44,866 --> 01:40:48,936
flYour anger is too much for
a petty quarrel"

883

"Let us meet soon"

887
01:42:11,866 --> 01:42:16,003
flCan't you calm down?fl

888
01:42:16,199 --> 01:42:21,271
fl Smile at me oncefl

889
01:43:27,566 --> 01:43:28,900
Hello
- Come in father-in-law.

890
01:43:30,100 --> 01:43:34,170
Executive officer asked us to meet
you all regarding the visit to temple

891
01:43:34,300 --> 01:43:36,568
l couldn't recognize you in the
darkness. Please come in.

892
01:43:43,833 --> 01:43:44,900
Your husband...?
- He is sleeping.

893
01:43:45,100 --> 01:43:47,569
What were you doing?
- Watching T.V

894
01:43:48,666 --> 01:43:53,437
Please be seated.
- Instruct us regarding arrangements

895
01:43:54,300 --> 01:43:57,569
Actually my in-laws, husband...
early morning....

896
01:44:02,166 --> 01:44:03,166
Your anger is cooled?

897
01:44:04,766 --> 01:44:09,904
lt's your habit to hurt and say sorry
- Now l'm not here to say sorry.

898
01:44:10,033 --> 01:44:14,036
Then?
- To say there was reason for my anger

899
01:44:14,166 --> 01:44:18,236
What about dinner?
- Since morning we will be fasting.

900
01:44:21,100 --> 01:44:23,302
We can talk about this later on.
- You don't have enough time.

901
01:44:23,433 --> 01:44:29,238
Since morning there is no food, no
petrol, no money. Situation is bad.

902
01:44:32,833 --> 01:44:33,967
lf you can arrange for Rs.1000, l'll
repay you in Hyderabad.

903
01:44:34,433 --> 01:44:40,372
You've come so far for me... you want
me to rate your love for me?

904
01:44:44,666 --> 01:44:48,836
l don't have the strength to laugh
Just have a look at him

905
01:44:56,166 --> 01:44:57,700
His condition is so bad, he may
eat plates and spoons also...

906
01:45:05,699 --> 01:45:07,835
Only good night?
- l gave you money?

907
01:45:10,500 --> 01:45:11,500
You'll never change in life

908
01:45:13,500 --> 01:45:17,837
ln the morning, my mother-in-law will
be performing special ritual...

909
01:45:17,966 --> 01:45:19,767
Do we need any permission for that?

910
01:45:20,166 --> 01:45:24,169
Since childhood my wish is
to view from hill top.

911
01:45:24,300 --> 01:45:25,300
Will l get chance to see that?

912
01:45:25,433 --> 01:45:29,570
My father-in-law is not performing
that ritual...but can l do it?

913
01:45:29,699 --> 01:45:32,502
We need extra sweets if you
need any recommendation...

914
01:45:32,699 --> 01:45:35,836
What happened?
- We'll be leaving now.

915
01:45:35,966 --> 01:45:39,602
You'll be here in the morning?
- We'll send some one else.

916
01:45:39,766 --> 01:45:44,170
Since you have become quiet familiar
.. .we can recognize you.. .

917
01:45:45,100 --> 01:45:48,369
He'll also be thin and tiny like him.
Then that's fine.

918
01:45:52,333 --> 01:45:54,501
Anything else?
- 2 coffee

919
01:45:54,633 --> 01:45:57,035
Why 2 coffee for one person?
- Should l drink you also?

920
01:46:00,833 --> 01:46:04,169
What do you need sir?
- Chutney sans idli, curry sans puri

921
01:46:04,300 --> 01:46:06,669

922
01:46:16,300 --> 01:46:17,868
You have a brother?
- Yes, sir.

923
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:19,835
He looks exactly like you?
- Yes, sir.

924
01:46:19,966 --> 01:46:23,035
He was lost nearby the pond?
- Exactly, sir.

925
01:46:23,166 --> 01:46:27,036
Your brother is searching for you
under the street light with a torch

926
01:46:27,166 --> 01:46:29,268
You are having tiffin here.
- It's me

927
01:46:29,399 --> 01:46:30,400
Then you are...

928
01:46:36,500 --> 01:46:37,500
Then they haven't found him yet.

929
01:46:41,433 --> 01:46:44,569
Why didn't you wake me up for tiffin?
- Tomorrow l'll.

930
01:46:47,833 --> 01:46:51,770
Do you need to come for Anjali
till here? For a new female its okay

931
01:46:51,899 --> 01:46:54,569
Aren't you bored with her.
Why are looking like that.

932
01:46:54,699 --> 01:46:57,235

anger or tiredness

01:46:57,366 --> 01:47:00,368
Helplessness
- Here, who should.. .

934
01:47:00,500 --> 01:47:02,501
You should say and l should listen
Come lets move

lt'll take _o hours for the
completion of rituals

936
01:47:17,300 --> 01:47:21,837
lf l stand here till then, they'll
think l am planning for a robbery

937
01:47:22,433 --> 01:47:24,268
What is the matter?
- l need to speak with her.

938
01:47:24,399 --> 01:47:27,503
Did you finish Rs.1000 already?
- Should it be only about money?

939
01:49:06,333 --> 01:49:11,104
Look here... smile...
move back... little more

940
01:49:11,233 --> 01:49:13,301
How much more should we?
- Okay stand there

01:49:13,433 --> 01:49:16,569
What's happening?
- Daddy, stand here for a snap.

942
01:49:16,699 --> 01:49:20,570
Why do you do creative things?
- Should he beg you for a snap?

943
01:49:28,100 --> 01:49:34,306
See how good he was!
- It would've been better this way.

944
01:49:38,500 --> 01:49:39,500
Come now.

945
01:49:39,833 --> 01:49:44,904
Your wish will come true if you
put money in this pond and wish

946
01:49:46,766 --> 01:49:49,168
How can money in this water
will make your wish true?

947
01:49:49,500 --> 01:49:56,840
People believe it since ages. You'll
experience only if you've faith in God

948
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:03,838
You know if you put money in here
and wish...it'll turn true.

949
01:50:17,433 --> 01:50:19,501
You just said you do not
believe in it?

950
01:50:19,966 --> 01:50:23,169
Until now l didn't believe. But my
daughter wished for something

951
01:50:23,300 --> 01:50:24,834
l wished, let her wish come true.

Why are you waiting so much? l'll

954
01:50:51,566 --> 01:50:55,970
l was thinking to talk to them,
now l feel its better l don't talk.

955
01:51:08,866 --> 01:51:11,101
l'll fill petrol and be back.

- What's it?

958
01:51:28,833 --> 01:51:30,768
You have a brother?
- Yes, l have.

959
01:51:30,899 --> 01:51:32,568
He looks like you?
- Yes, he is.

960
01:51:32,699 --> 01:51:36,103
You lost him near the pond?
- Yes. So what?

961
01:51:36,233 --> 01:51:41,438
Your brother is searching for you
Ieaving his meals, breakfast...

962
01:51:41,566 --> 01:51:43,434
l'm the brother.
- Then you are...?

963
01:51:46,566 --> 01:51:52,371
Why is it l always see you and not him?
- You want an answer for this?

964
01:51:52,500 --> 01:51:55,502
Now, here and this second, l need it
- Be on your first gear.

965
01:51:57,433 --> 01:51:58,967
Who gave this police job to you?

966
01:51:59,500 --> 01:52:02,903
l am in same shirt, still you can't
recognize me, how'll you catch thieves?

967
01:52:04,166 --> 01:52:08,169
Was ritual 'Poornavara' ever performed
in the history of this temple?

968
01:52:08,300 --> 01:52:13,304
How could you ever believe me?
- Then Laddu?

969
01:52:13,433 --> 01:52:16,669
You'll not find him.
- Because he doesn't exist.

970
01:52:18,766 --> 01:52:19,766
Stop there.

971
01:52:20,833 --> 01:52:24,570
We stopped to say, even if you shout,
we'll not stop. Now move.

972
01:52:28,833 --> 01:52:33,504
Today's horoscope. Let me check out
how's today. Capricorn...

973
01:52:33,633 --> 01:52:38,170
Today is not very smooth.

974
01:52:38,300 --> 01:52:42,504
Some unexpected experiences
will occur

975
01:52:43,166 --> 01:52:44,166
Rishi is back.

976
01:52:44,766 --> 01:52:47,835
You know how tensed we were
in these _o days?

977
01:52:47,966 --> 01:52:50,568
Rishi had been to Annavaram temple.

978
01:52:50,699 --> 01:52:54,103
You are back?
-See how happy your father is for you!

979
01:52:54,233 --> 01:52:57,369
lt's not happiness, it is a pain.
Any way you had been there...

980
01:52:57,500 --> 01:53:00,769
... should have started a photo studio
there. Why did you come back?

981
01:53:00,899 --> 01:53:03,168
lf you speak like this, then again
he'll walk out of the house

982
01:53:03,300 --> 01:53:06,002
Am l so lucky?
Well why you had been to Annavaram?

983
01:53:06,833 --> 01:53:09,502
Pandu had prayed that he'll visit
there if he attempts the exams

984
01:53:09,633 --> 01:53:11,167
Did he clear the exams?
- No

985
01:53:11,199 --> 01:53:12,200
Then why you had been?

986
01:53:12,333 --> 01:53:15,636
His prayer was for attempting and not
to clear the exams. Hence we went.

987
01:53:21,766 --> 01:53:27,438
This is good.
- l can see only my legs but not head.

988
01:53:27,566 --> 01:53:29,501
Photo is like that. It appears
as you are.

989
01:53:29,633 --> 01:53:32,235
But you can't accept that you
are not a good photographer.

990
01:53:32,366 --> 01:53:35,235
His work is good. Show me those.

991
01:53:35,366 --> 01:53:38,502
At least my legs are seen, but
you are not seen at all

992
01:53:38,633 --> 01:53:40,835
Yes, l am missing from this snap.

993
01:53:40,966 --> 01:53:42,167
You were in prayer meeting

994
01:53:42,300 --> 01:53:43,334
But why aren't you there
in any the snaps?

995
01:53:43,466 --> 01:53:46,502
lt's me who has taken the photos,
how'll l be? They'll kill me!

996
01:53:46,633 --> 01:53:49,369
Looking a new bride for me?
- That's one thing that's remaining.

997
01:53:49,500 --> 01:53:52,769
Daddy, check out these photos
of Annavaram.

998
01:53:52,899 --> 01:53:54,701
Photos are there... but
are we there in it?

999
01:53:54,966 --> 01:53:58,703
lnstead of seeing, they were searching
themselves... hence l asked.

1000
01:53:59,966 --> 01:54:04,003
How come this snap is so dark?
- Use torch, you'll know the difference

1001
01:54:05,566 --> 01:54:07,834
Why is it, only half of the
temple is seen?

1002
01:54:07,966 --> 01:54:09,567
lf you take it from there...
it will be like this

1003
01:54:09,699 --> 01:54:11,768
So for a complete snap of temple
it should be taken from Hyderabad?

1004
01:54:12,833 --> 01:54:15,101
Then, l'll stop taking snaps.
- Its an excellent decision.

1005
01:54:16,633 --> 01:54:18,101
Get coffee for me.
- Okay.

1006
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:21,101
lt's not that bad at all.

1007
01:54:21,566 --> 01:54:22,566
Just see this...

1008
01:54:24,833 --> 01:54:25,833
Take it

1009
01:54:48,500 --> 01:54:49,500
Where is Anjali?

1010
01:54:55,566 --> 01:54:58,568
l have already started.
Okay...

1011
01:55:00,566 --> 01:55:02,567
Just call me again l'll
send immediately.

1012
01:55:08,966 --> 01:55:11,702
How are you? Why you haven't
visited us recently?

1013
01:55:11,833 --> 01:55:14,902
You are talking to her without
telling me who is she?

1014
01:55:15,033 --> 01:55:18,770
She is college-mate of Rishi.
Rishi's father

1015
01:55:18,899 --> 01:55:19,900
That's the problem

1016
01:55:20,033 --> 01:55:22,301
Why are you here?
- Why do we come to hotel?

1017
01:55:22,500 --> 01:55:25,703
You can't wait to be introduced...
... after that you speak foolishly

1018
01:55:27,166 --> 01:55:31,169
Expecting a friend of yours?
- For a friend... where is Rishi?

1019
01:55:31,300 --> 01:55:33,101
He has come.
- He has come? Where?

1020
01:55:33,233 --> 01:55:37,670
He's down. Not there, down the table.
Dear Rishi...?

1021
01:55:37,800 --> 01:55:38,901
Yes, daddy.
- Please come up.

1022
01:55:42,766 --> 01:55:47,303
Daddy, you are here for lunch?
- They supply you down there also?

1023
01:55:47,433 --> 01:55:51,103
No, l was searching for
my Rs.100 coin.

1024
01:55:51,233 --> 01:55:54,569
Everything would have been perfect,
except for that... coin Rs.10O

1025
01:55:54,699 --> 01:55:56,501
Yes, daddy. l felt the same
after you told.

1026
01:55:56,633 --> 01:55:58,234
l'll remove my slipper.
- Is it worn out?

1027
01:55:58,366 --> 01:56:00,501
Did you see?
- Is it a slipper?

1028
01:56:00,833 --> 01:56:02,768
You all be seated over there, l
want to talk to this girl.

1029
01:56:03,500 --> 01:56:05,902
Atleast once in a while
please obey me.

1030
01:56:07,566 --> 01:56:09,301
Boss, you too.

1031
01:56:12,166 --> 01:56:13,166
Sit down.

1032
01:56:14,699 --> 01:56:16,368
What is your name?
- Anjali.

1033
01:56:17,366 --> 01:56:18,433
What is the relation be_een you both?

1034
01:56:21,899 --> 01:56:22,900
Want to get married?

1035
01:56:24,633 --> 01:56:26,167
Even we need to prepare
for the marriage.

1036
01:56:28,899 --> 01:56:31,702
You know how to cook?
- We have a cook at home.

1037
01:56:34,500 --> 01:56:38,503
You know how to was dishes?
- We have a servant for it.

01:56:38,699 --> 01:56:42,336
You know to wash clothes?
- We have washing machine.

1039
01:56:42,466 --> 01:56:46,403
Atleast you know how to sweep?
We have vacuum cleaner.

1040
01:56:47,666 --> 01:56:49,834
You are just the same girl
as l had wished for him!

1041
01:56:52,233 --> 01:56:56,337
l'll learn all these.
- No. Don't learn anything

1042
01:56:56,500 --> 01:57:01,171
After marriage when he is cooking,
washing clothes..., sweeping floor

1043
01:57:15,166 --> 01:57:21,672
That's my dream. l liked you. You
should marry only my son.

1044
01:57:22,633 --> 01:57:25,569
l liked her very much... she
doesn't know any household jobs

1045
01:57:56,933 --> 01:58:00,936
"You have impressed me
and also invited me"

1046
01:58:01,733 --> 01:58:04,802
"Eveything is going on smooth now"

1047
01:58:06,699 --> 01:58:10,937
"Its the golden moment in our lives
and lets not waste time"

1048
01:58:11,733 --> 01:58:14,469
"Let us see an auspicious day
and get married now"

1049
01:58:21,133 --> 01:58:23,468
"The moment l heard this message"

1050
01:58:25,933 --> 01:58:28,869
"My heart skipped a beat"

1051
01:58:29,800 --> 01:58:35,238
"Your love captured my heart
and commanded me"

1052
01:58:35,366 --> 01:58:40,738
"l couldn't wait to respond
to your love"

1053
01:59:23,399 --> 01:59:25,869
"This wind is blowing"

1054
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:28,302
flBut at this moment its difFerentfl

1055
01:59:28,433 --> 01:59:31,702

1062
01:59:57,533 --> 01:59:59,801

02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:01,868

"l'll be with you in
evey walk of lifefl

1073
02:01:47,833 --> 02:01:49,100
What do you want?
- Go out.

1074
02:01:55,266 --> 02:01:57,101
Your playing games with me?

1075
02:01:57,833 --> 02:02:02,571
lf l decide about you, then you'll not
be there to guess what'll happen

1076
02:02:02,933 --> 02:02:07,304
l warned you on that day, if you accept
money, then you should forget her

1077
02:02:08,100 --> 02:02:11,436
You are no way equal to me. But still
l gave you money. You know why?

1078
02:02:11,966 --> 02:02:13,267
l thought atleast you will keep
up your word.

1079
02:02:14,366 --> 02:02:16,267
lf l am ready to leave a girl
for 10 millions

1080
02:02:17,600 --> 02:02:18,834
How could you think that l would
keep up my word?

1081
02:02:20,500 --> 02:02:24,237
Okay, l said it.
But how did you trust me?

1082
02:02:27,833 --> 02:02:35,373
This is... named as 'B.P' by doctors
and 'anger' to a normal man.

1083
02:02:37,233 --> 02:02:39,568
When you told me to forget your
daughter just for 10 millions...

1084
02:02:40,500 --> 02:02:43,769
My anger...was 10 times
greater than yours.

1085
02:02:45,433 --> 02:02:48,102
With money you can buy bread,
but can't kill hunger.

1086
02:02:48,233 --> 02:02:53,237
Can buy bed, not sleep, can never
buy Love...if l would have told...

1087
02:02:54,100 --> 02:02:55,100
... then you wouldn't
have understood.

1088
02:02:55,233 --> 02:02:57,768
You would've thought l'm young
blooded and a nuisance.

1089
02:02:59,100 --> 02:03:04,104
But now if l say the same...
you'll understand better.

1090
02:03:08,566 --> 02:03:09,266
That's why l am saying again...
can buy bread not hunger...

1091
02:03:09,933 --> 02:03:17,607
... can buy bed not sleep,
never can you buy our love.

1092
02:03:22,433 --> 02:03:27,104
ls it of any use to give an A.C to a
guy who doesn't have electric supply

1093
02:03:27,899 --> 02:03:29,901
According to me it's just the same.
Hence l've kept it there.

1094
02:03:42,500 --> 02:03:46,770
Money is not greater than love, this is
conveyed by great monuments like

1095
02:03:47,766 --> 02:03:54,639
Taj Mahal, Char Minar...
You can only see, but can't buy them.

1096
02:04:18,899 --> 02:04:21,402
Hello, you are...
- My name is Vishwanath.

1097
02:04:22,133 --> 02:04:23,334
Please be seated...

1098
02:04:25,133 --> 02:04:26,534
She is my wife.
She is my daughter.

1099
02:04:26,733 --> 02:04:30,570
Get 2 coffee soon.
- Less sugar please, l am diabetic

1100
02:04:38,533 --> 02:04:41,636
Anjali and your son... l believe you
know all about it

1101
02:04:41,766 --> 02:04:44,602
l know about it. Actually, l was
thinking to visit you personally

1102
02:04:46,733 --> 02:04:49,802
What's your name?
- Haven't looked out any guy for her

1103
02:04:49,933 --> 02:04:53,069
Why so early? Let's wait for
another 2 to 3 years.

1104
02:04:54,199 --> 02:04:57,136
lf you start from now, marriage
will occur in 2 years.

1105
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:01,669
Everybody, don't choose,
like my daughter.

1106
02:05:04,333 --> 02:05:11,006
Everybody aren't alike. l have found
a guy for your daughter.

1107
02:05:11,133 --> 02:05:14,135
Why all this?
- l'll call him, have a look at him.

1108
02:05:14,833 --> 02:05:17,869
Why now?
- Just call him.

1109
02:05:20,066 --> 02:05:21,066
What are you studying?

1110
02:05:25,533 --> 02:05:26,533
Should study well.

1111
02:05:29,399 --> 02:05:34,471
His name is Parameswar Rao.
He is an orphan.

1112
02:05:35,133 --> 02:05:39,403
He didn't like his orphanage,
hence he stopped studies and left.

1113
02:05:39,866 --> 02:05:43,069
Since then he has made a
living on his earnings.

1114
02:05:43,199 --> 02:05:44,935
He earns around 2 to 3 thousand

1115
02:05:46,600 --> 02:05:50,403
On Saturday, he is at Birla temple
on Thursday, he is at Sai baba temple

1116
02:05:50,533 --> 02:05:55,337
On Tuesdays, he is at Maruthi temple,
very famous, you must be knowing it.

1117
02:05:55,800 --> 02:06:00,671
He collects the offerings made for
God and that's enough to live.

1118
02:06:00,800 --> 02:06:01,800
Get up, l said get up.

1119
02:06:06,133 --> 02:06:07,767
Just because we offered you coffee...

1120
02:06:07,899 --> 02:06:09,334
... you thought we'll remain silent
hearing to your rubbish

1121
02:06:09,600 --> 02:06:13,737
You be quiet
Being so elderly, don't you've decency

1122
02:06:14,800 --> 02:06:17,068
l may not be rich enough to get my
daughter married to a millionaire

1123
02:06:17,199 --> 02:06:21,203
But l am definitely not so poor that
l'll marry her to a beggar.

1124
02:06:22,733 --> 02:06:27,270
Just because you are Anjali's father
l am leaving you, else...

1125
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:31,000
Have you finished?

1126
02:06:34,333 --> 02:06:39,271
You are feeling bad, and
your son call it anger

1127
02:06:40,666 --> 02:06:46,571
lf a beggar can't match the
status of a super market owner.

1128
02:06:47,533 --> 02:06:54,006
Can you expect a shop owner's son match
the status of a billionaire like me?

1129
02:06:55,199 --> 02:06:56,935
l could have asked you
the same in words

1130
02:06:57,066 --> 02:06:59,601
Can you marry your
daughter to a beggar?

1131
02:06:59,733 --> 02:07:02,402
But you will misjudge me that
l am speaking in anger.

1132
02:07:02,600 --> 02:07:06,804
But now there is no room for misjudging.
Even this is your son's policy.

1133
02:07:08,199 --> 02:07:13,471
Everybody marries after succeeding.
But your son is marrying to succeed.

1134
02:07:14,733 --> 02:07:19,003
l am not angry on you. l know its
wrong to speak these in front of you.

1135
02:07:19,133 --> 02:07:23,070
l did this not to hurt you all, but to
show you how much l was hurt?

1136
02:07:23,666 --> 02:07:29,138
lf l see your son with her again...

1137
02:07:29,266 --> 02:07:31,468
The consequences will not be good
... Really not good.

1138
02:07:32,533 --> 02:07:39,006
This was my first step. You estimate
how drastic will my last step be?

1139
02:07:40,533 --> 02:07:44,403
Don't compel me to do it...
The coffee was good.

1140
02:07:57,733 --> 02:08:00,602
ls Mr. Vishawanath here?
- Do you have an appointment?

1141
02:08:01,266 --> 02:08:03,401
l asked if he is available.
- He is there.

1142
02:08:28,399 --> 02:08:32,170
You want to talk then do it directly,
don't create a scene in office!

1143
02:08:33,566 --> 02:08:39,138
l want to say the same. Speak directly
to me. Don't create a scene in my house

1144
02:08:42,333 --> 02:08:43,333
Come inside.

1145
02:08:46,733 --> 02:08:49,402
Just because you break computers, l'll
get scared and marry you to her?

1146
02:08:50,399 --> 02:08:53,669
Do you think l'll leave your daughter,
if you create a scene in my house?

1147
02:08:55,133 --> 02:08:59,337
lf my sister wants to marry a beggar,
rather than shouting l will think

1148
02:08:59,533 --> 02:09:03,470
Since 20 years she has been taught
our culture, tradition...

1149
02:09:03,600 --> 02:09:07,870
And if she likes a beggar then there
is some similarity be_een them.

1150
02:09:08,066 --> 02:09:09,400
Didn't you understand?

1151
02:09:10,466 --> 02:09:12,668
Your exactly problem is that
you can't like me.

1152
02:09:12,866 --> 02:09:15,802
Not just me, you can't like
anyone related to Anjali

1153
02:09:16,133 --> 02:09:19,536
Because, you want a person
like you.

1154
02:09:19,666 --> 02:09:25,872
... a rich guy who wears 3 piece suit
talks less and works more

1155
02:09:27,133 --> 02:09:28,934
You won't get him...
It's very difficult.

1156
02:09:29,800 --> 02:09:34,070
But an young guy will be like me.
He'll be naughty.

1157
02:09:34,199 --> 02:09:37,736
He'll watch movies and hide it from
parents, roams around with his friends

1158
02:09:38,399 --> 02:09:41,803
He is normal like this... else he has
to see a doctor immediately

1159
02:09:42,133 --> 02:09:46,003
When you were young, you would've done
same things... You might've forgotten

1160
02:09:47,466 --> 02:09:48,466
l have conveyed message.

1161
02:09:54,399 --> 02:09:59,905
My love to Anjali may bring enmity.
It's not good for both

1162
02:10:14,733 --> 02:10:19,337
The sweets they distribute is good
- You be near the car, l'll be back.

1163
02:10:29,800 --> 02:10:35,572
What happened? Why are you like this?
- Your father had been to our house...

1164
02:11:02,566 --> 02:11:03,566
What is it?

1165
02:11:08,333 --> 02:11:10,268
You know Rishi?

1166
02:11:14,133 --> 02:11:16,735
Why you didn't tell me
that you know him?

1167
02:11:17,399 --> 02:11:22,471
l thought of asking you about him...
then l felt it was irrelevant...

1168
02:11:23,399 --> 02:11:28,905
You had been to his place and asked his
sister to be married to a beggar?

1169
02:11:32,733 --> 02:11:33,733
lsn't it wrong?

1170
02:11:42,333 --> 02:11:46,737
lt would have been so nice if...
whatever we believe is always right

1171
02:11:48,800 --> 02:11:51,202
When you were kid, you
had a teddy bear

1172
02:11:52,399 --> 02:11:54,268
Anybody touches it...
you would be angered

1173
02:11:55,266 --> 02:11:59,203
l had hit your mother, for the same.
Even l am no different than you.

1174
02:12:00,466 --> 02:12:02,868
l love and care about you. Why should
l marry you to some one like...?

1175
02:12:05,733 --> 02:12:12,272
l didn't do any mistake. l showed
them my love to you. Not my anger

1176
02:12:13,266 --> 02:12:16,402
They told you what l did but did
they tell you...

1177
02:12:16,533 --> 02:12:22,939
... what their son did in my office?
Broke computers, with guards he...

1178
02:12:24,066 --> 02:12:31,139
What's wrong with me...? Now l
realized... if l hit someone...

1179
02:12:31,266 --> 02:12:33,801
l am giving an explanation
to my daughter... ?

1180
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:38,237
l am explaining to my Anjali...
... for somebody else...

1181
02:12:40,866 --> 02:12:53,612
You have taught me to respect elders
and love who are younger to me.

1182
02:12:55,333 --> 02:12:59,136
Then why are you so angry on Rishi?
- Why do you like him?

1183
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:06,704
l don't get angry, but l
feel pain. Because...

1184
02:13:07,600 --> 02:13:13,205
l know your liking be it the colour,
taste, flavor anything...

1185
02:13:13,733 --> 02:13:16,402
But l don't know what type
of a man you like...

1186
02:13:20,333 --> 02:13:22,735
This name is like
a worm in my brain...

1187
02:13:25,600 --> 02:13:28,936
Good people do always
right things.

1188
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:32,736
But one who loves, do not
care for anything

1189
02:13:34,199 --> 02:13:39,305
You decide if you want good people
or some one who loves you

1190
02:13:39,433 --> 02:13:45,272
l want to know now...
you like him or me?

1191
02:13:47,600 --> 02:13:50,803
Such a small question...
you like me or him?

1192
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:57,136
l like you very much, daddy.
- Then Rishi?

1193
02:14:03,800 --> 02:14:11,174
Females are very smart. You want
both father's and lover's love.

1194
02:14:11,333 --> 02:14:17,605
20 years with her father,
80 years with her husband.

1195
02:14:18,333 --> 02:14:22,403
On a scale of 100 you have given
me 20 and 80 for him.

1196
02:14:24,399 --> 02:14:27,936
Couldn't you give me 15 more.

1197
02:14:30,899 --> 02:14:32,401
Only 20 for me?

1198
02:14:54,399 --> 02:14:56,335
lt is so hot!...
What are you all looking at?

1199
02:14:56,899 --> 02:15:02,005
Pawan went behind a tree with a girl...
- He might be having coffee with her.

1200
02:15:02,733 --> 02:15:05,335
Coffee means... lip... kiss!

1201
02:15:09,066 --> 02:15:12,135
Hello sir, where are going?
- Had headache, so going for a coffee

1202
02:15:14,066 --> 02:15:17,936
Going in opposite direction of canteen?
- l like coffee given by only her.

1203
02:15:19,333 --> 02:15:23,336
Why are they laughing?
- It's great you've it at this age also

1204
02:15:23,533 --> 02:15:30,139
l used to've a dozen coffee at your age
- 12 coffee a day? And now?

1205
02:15:30,266 --> 02:15:33,902
Now l've 5 to 6 coffee. But in
the morning, l must have it.

1206
02:15:34,066 --> 02:15:38,403
Only in the morning?
- Without that my day turns very bad.

1207
02:15:39,399 --> 02:15:43,804
You are very romantic fellow.
- You don't like coffee outside?

1208
02:15:43,933 --> 02:15:49,805
l hate coffee outside be it hotel or
canteen. l love what my wife gives.

1209
02:15:51,399 --> 02:15:54,402
You know why... because man gives
coffee in hotel or canteen.

1210
02:15:57,033 --> 02:16:00,936
What happened to him?
- Leave. Coffee is must for you, now

1211
02:16:01,066 --> 02:16:02,901
My wife may go out, so l need to go.

1212
02:16:04,199 --> 02:16:07,002
l don't understand why they
are laughing so much...

1213
02:16:08,399 --> 02:16:10,935
He may die laughing...
ask him to have a coffee.

1214
02:16:13,600 --> 02:16:14,600
Shall l give jam?

1215
02:16:20,133 --> 02:16:23,002
Car is given for servicing, can
you drop me to college?

1216
02:16:23,133 --> 02:16:24,801
l can't as l have very important work

1217
02:16:28,199 --> 02:16:29,868
ls it important than her?

1218
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:35,338
Priorities change, l can't ride cycle
now though it was important in youth.

1219
02:16:38,066 --> 02:16:39,534
Go in auto rickshaw.
- Auto?

1220
02:16:39,666 --> 02:16:44,270
What to do? Both have different
directions.

1221
02:16:44,399 --> 02:16:51,473
Who am l to ask her to
change her direction?

1222
02:17:17,399 --> 02:17:22,071
No l am leaving now.
- You don't want to play with me?

1223
02:17:22,533 --> 02:17:24,001
Think whatever you want. It doesn't
make any difference.

1224
02:18:31,899 --> 02:18:32,900
Why aren't you asleep?

1225
02:18:35,666 --> 02:18:37,734
Not feeling well?
- l am fine.

1226
02:18:38,466 --> 02:18:39,867
lt's already late. Go, sleep.

1227
02:18:44,899 --> 02:18:48,403
What's it?
- Today is my birthday.

1228
02:18:50,133 --> 02:18:54,070
l forgot. l'll arrange for a party,
invite your friends, including Rishi.

1229
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:41,339
What happened?
- l get scared if l look at you.

1230
02:19:43,933 --> 02:19:49,938
You were more like a friend to me.

1231
02:19:52,799 --> 02:19:59,673
You were so close to me...
This is the first time

1232
02:20:02,533 --> 02:20:04,334
l am feeling so scared
to look at you.

1233
02:20:06,733 --> 02:20:11,804
l feel like hugging you tightly...
and cry my heart out.

1234
02:20:15,733 --> 02:20:20,537
Now a days l am frightened.

1235
02:20:23,399 --> 02:20:28,204
You were never like this before. You
couldn't be without talking to me

1236
02:20:29,066 --> 02:20:34,337
You couldn't be without playing with
me and you forgot my birthday too?

1237
02:20:36,200 --> 02:20:37,200
You have changed.

1238
02:20:40,933 --> 02:20:44,536
No... l haven't changed.

1239
02:20:45,866 --> 02:20:49,736
You have changed.... come.

1240
02:20:52,733 --> 02:20:55,535
See. How many times your
number has been repeated?

1241
02:20:56,666 --> 02:21:01,003
You'll know how many times l had
dialled and disconnected.

1242
02:21:02,600 --> 02:21:09,406
Since l came, l've been controlling
myself not to give it to you.

1243
02:21:10,899 --> 02:21:18,073
You don't know. Since how long l
have been waiting for you here

1244
02:21:19,066 --> 02:21:25,071
But atleast once did l say you
have changed or cried? Right?

1245
02:21:26,133 --> 02:21:31,004
How will you know the way l used
to wait for you in tennis court

1246
02:21:31,733 --> 02:21:36,471
But l never said you changed,
or behave like this.

1247
02:21:37,866 --> 02:21:42,003
You have changed. Not me.

1248
02:21:42,866 --> 02:21:49,472
You have changed to an extent of hiding
the fact about your Mumbai visit.

1249
02:21:51,966 --> 02:21:58,739
When l asked where you had been, you
said you were at your friend's place.

1250
02:22:00,399 --> 02:22:04,403
You lied to me... on that day.

1251
02:22:05,733 --> 02:22:10,003
Then l didn't say you had changed
or cry like this

1252
02:22:14,933 --> 02:22:22,740
l loved you more than myself but you
Ioved him more than anyone else

1253
02:22:26,399 --> 02:22:33,740
One day you'll marry and leave...
But l'll die crying for you.

1254
02:22:37,533 --> 02:22:43,472
That's why... l want to change...
l am trying to change.

1255
02:22:46,566 --> 02:22:47,667
l am unable to change.

1256
02:22:49,399 --> 02:22:50,400
lt's difficult for us.

1257
02:22:53,200 --> 02:22:58,271
l want to change, l will change.

1258
02:22:59,266 --> 02:23:00,266
Why?

1259
02:23:01,933 --> 02:23:06,671
Haven't l controlled myself before?

1260
02:23:09,066 --> 02:23:10,534
l'll control somehow.

1261
02:23:13,066 --> 02:23:17,804
But... l'll... not blame you.
l'll change.

1262
02:23:21,200 --> 02:23:22,200
l'll change.

1263
02:23:31,466 --> 02:23:32,466
You shouldn't change.

1264
02:23:35,566 --> 02:23:36,733
You should remain the same.

1265
02:23:39,733 --> 02:23:40,733
You should say stories.

1266
02:23:44,066 --> 02:23:45,066
You should play tennis.

1267
02:23:46,899 --> 02:23:49,068
And you should be the first person
to wish me on my birthday.

1268
02:23:51,500 --> 02:23:53,001
You should like me the most.

1269
02:23:56,399 --> 02:23:57,400
Except you, l don't want anybody else.

1270
02:24:19,533 --> 02:24:21,067
What's it?
- What is that?

1271
02:24:21,200 --> 02:24:26,405
Checking out brochures.
- l want to talk to you.

1272
02:24:27,533 --> 02:24:31,803
Tell me daddy.
- For me... can you talk to Sarathi?

1273
02:24:32,799 --> 02:24:40,207
Why me? He never disobeys you.
- Instead of telling, you ask him.

1274
02:24:40,666 --> 02:24:46,138
What should l ask?
- If he is interested in marrying her?

1275
02:24:46,600 --> 02:24:50,337
Sarathi? What is the urgency
of her marriage?

1276
02:24:53,066 --> 02:24:56,335
Are you scared about Rishi?
- How do you know about him?

1277
02:24:57,600 --> 02:25:05,274
J
When we know if there's debit of Re.1
will we not know about 10 millions?

1278
02:25:09,666 --> 02:25:13,803
Please don't feel bad, l think,
for Anjali, Rishi is correct.

1279
02:25:15,333 --> 02:25:20,071
Because, there is a resemblance
in yours and his love to Anjali.

1280
02:25:21,066 --> 02:25:24,869
lf she wanted sweets, then you used to
get it for her even in midnight.

1281
02:25:25,733 --> 02:25:33,140
Similarly is Rishi, she wanted to see
sea, in an hour she was in front of it

1282
02:25:33,266 --> 02:25:38,738
That's what l am scared about. One day,
to spend he may sell her ornaments.

1283
02:25:39,733 --> 02:25:45,905
He knows only to love and not to live.
Hence l want her to marry Sarathi

1284
02:25:47,566 --> 02:25:51,202
You think about her next birthday gift,
from this birthday itself

1285
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:56,738
Though you love her,it's great thought
to get her married as per your choice!

1286
02:25:58,399 --> 02:26:01,569
Now l came to know what kind of
son-in-law you are looking for.

1287
02:26:03,899 --> 02:26:09,805
lf she has to stay with you, he
shouldn't have his own house or family

1288
02:26:12,733 --> 02:26:17,671
lf he has his own business or job,
he may leave this house with her.

1289
02:26:17,866 --> 02:26:20,668
So he shouldn't be independent.

1290
02:26:20,866 --> 02:26:24,269
To be simple he shouldn't be like you.

1291
02:26:31,466 --> 02:26:36,404
l am lucky, if l had
been like you...

1292
02:26:37,533 --> 02:26:39,134
We wouldn't have been
together so long!

1293
02:26:50,533 --> 02:26:53,669
We are getting married on
Monday morning 10.42 a.m

1294
02:26:55,399 --> 02:26:56,534
l know you don't want this marriage.

1295
02:26:58,533 --> 02:27:05,740
Even l don't like it. Because now l
call him 'Sir' from 9 a.m to 5 p.m

1296
02:27:05,866 --> 02:27:09,669
lf l marry you then l have to call
him the same...for 24 hours

1297
02:27:11,299 --> 02:27:15,737
Most important thing is
you love Rishi.

1298
02:27:17,066 --> 02:27:21,336
Even l love my life, but why should
l marry a girl who loves someone.

1299
02:27:22,533 --> 02:27:26,536
Sorry, l shared my feelings.
- Why don't you do the same to my father

1300
02:27:26,666 --> 02:27:29,568
l was a destitute and he
gave me a position

1301
02:27:29,733 --> 02:27:33,570
lf l disagree now in 5 minutes he'll
make me a destitute.

1302
02:27:34,399 --> 02:27:38,003
Can't you believe?
Your father will do anything for you.

1303
02:27:38,133 --> 02:27:40,668
To separate you from Rishi, he
gave Rishi 10 millions

1304
02:27:42,666 --> 02:27:44,401
Of course he returned it back...

1305
02:27:44,566 --> 02:27:48,236
Rishi has returned the money though
he could make a life out of it.

1306
02:27:48,366 --> 02:27:50,267
Though he is so good, your
father is against him.

1307
02:27:50,399 --> 02:27:55,138
l don't understand neither...
nor do l find it essential to know.

1308
02:27:57,200 --> 02:28:01,904
So, l'll not tell it to your father.
But one thing...

1309
02:28:02,666 --> 02:28:09,139
Marriage shouldn't work out. Either you
speak to Rishi or your father.

1310
02:28:10,066 --> 02:28:14,670
l'll be the bridegroom but this
marriage shouldn't happen.

1311
02:28:16,200 --> 02:28:22,005
Love is yours, problem is yours, it
is up to you how you stop it.

1312
02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:42,202
What happened? Why are you
here at this hour

1313
02:28:44,333 --> 02:28:45,901
ls Rishi there?
- Come inside

1314
02:28:46,033 --> 02:28:48,068
l want to speak to Rishi urgently.

1315
02:29:05,799 --> 02:29:08,235
What is it?
Why you didn't tell me?

1316
02:29:08,333 --> 02:29:10,802
Why you didn't tell me that my
father had given you money?

1317
02:29:16,799 --> 02:29:21,404
Many a times l thought of telling you,
l came to Annavaram just for this.

1318
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:27,838
But when l saw the love be_een you and
your father, l decided not to tell.

1319
02:29:29,200 --> 02:29:34,071
Your father gave money not to buy my
Iove, but to show how much he loves you

1320
02:29:34,899 --> 02:29:41,072
According to him the 10 thousands
is just peanuts.

1321
02:29:41,200 --> 02:29:44,403
So if he gives you money, to get me
married to Sarathi...is love?

1322
02:29:44,600 --> 02:29:50,205
l don't care if he likes me or not. l
want to know if you love me or not.

1323
02:29:53,399 --> 02:30:01,274
l want to get married now, here. That's
why l am here at this hour

1324
02:30:02,799 --> 02:30:08,672
lf your father cries you'll go to him
if he commits mistake, you come near me

1325
02:30:11,600 --> 02:30:18,807
lf you love, you've to forgive.
Else accept you don't love.

1326
02:30:21,000 --> 02:30:28,407
lf you marry me now, then its not for
Iove but for anger on your father.

1327
02:30:31,466 --> 02:30:38,406
This anger will cool down, but the
marriage will be forever

1328
02:30:44,899 --> 02:30:49,804
Remember one thing, people
in love can't hurt

1329
02:30:53,899 --> 02:30:58,404
Since your father loves you,
he can never hurt you.

1330
02:31:07,066 --> 02:31:08,066
Let's go.

1331
02:31:15,200 --> 02:31:18,536
Don't send me.

1332
02:31:28,200 --> 02:31:29,200
Nothing will happen.

1333
02:31:43,666 --> 02:31:44,666
Trust me

1334
02:31:45,733 --> 02:31:47,334
l have called up Anu's house,
she is not...

1335
02:31:47,533 --> 02:31:49,268
Ask if she is there with Sarathi?

1336
02:32:09,133 --> 02:32:10,133
Go inside.

1337
02:32:17,566 --> 02:32:18,566
lts okay, go inside.

1338
02:32:39,899 --> 02:32:41,735
l didn't get her here, because
l was scared of you

1339
02:32:43,733 --> 02:32:47,670
We could've married. But we didn't
want to put you down in society.

1340
02:32:51,000 --> 02:32:54,803
Honesty is greater than love.

1341
02:32:55,000 --> 02:32:57,135
That's why l am leaving her here.

1342
02:33:01,100 --> 02:33:05,871
lf Sarathi is the right person for
her, there will be a marriage

1343
02:33:07,933 --> 02:33:12,003
lf not, nobody can make this
marriage at any cost.

1344
02:33:25,166 --> 02:33:27,701
Though l am yours

1345
02:33:31,366 --> 02:33:33,868
l am not there with you

1346
02:33:37,233 --> 02:33:41,770
"Tears have never stopped
rolling down the cheeks"

1347
02:33:42,866 --> 02:33:47,870
flMy heart is filled of your memoriesfl

1348
02:33:48,366 --> 02:33:50,901
flTomorrow will be dimerent

1350

flMy heart is throbbing only for
you and it needs you"

1351
02:34:02,899 --> 02:34:07,704
"The silence is killing me
with your memories"

1352
02:35:08,299 --> 02:35:13,104
"We are in pain to please
others"

1353
02:35:13,299 --> 02:35:18,438
"But we are helpless
regarding this"

1354
02:35:20,299 --> 02:35:24,837
"Its waste to run behind the
wind to change its direction"

1355
02:35:25,166 --> 02:35:30,304
"l am torn apart between you both"

1356
02:35:32,166 --> 02:35:36,637
flls it a sin to be in love?fl

1357
02:35:37,633 --> 02:35:42,371
flCan't l forget your memoriesfl

1359
02:35:45,366 --> 02:35:48,368
"Its increasing... nothing else"

"But when l proclaimed my love
You have become heartless"

1364

1365
02:37:10,033 --> 02:37:14,103

02:37:14,700 --> 02:37:17,569

1367
02:37:17,700 --> 02:37:20,769
flShould l choose a caring heartfl

1368
02:38:25,133 --> 02:38:32,106
Daddy, since childhood you've fulfilled
all her wishes, why not now?

1369
02:38:33,600 --> 02:38:36,135
Aren't you feeling anything?

1370
02:38:38,133 --> 02:38:42,537
On first day of school, children cry,
do we stop their education.

1371
02:38:44,933 --> 02:38:46,200
Get Rishi here.
- Daddy?

1372
02:38:46,866 --> 02:38:48,267
He has to be right on the time
of taking oath.

1373
02:39:11,266 --> 02:39:13,001
Marriage oath taking time is
nearing... call the bride

1374
02:40:21,433 --> 02:40:22,433
You can tie piouìTali'

1375
02:40:23,933 --> 02:40:25,934
Sarathi, one minute.

1376
02:40:36,066 --> 02:40:39,536
You said, if you were right then
this marriage will occur

1377
02:40:39,666 --> 02:40:42,435
lf not, nobody can stop it.

1378
02:40:45,266 --> 02:40:46,433
You have to see this marriage

1379
02:40:48,600 --> 02:40:50,802
You have to accept that l am right.

1380
02:40:52,133 --> 02:40:54,201
You need to know that you are not
the right match for Anjali.

1381
02:40:54,333 --> 02:40:55,767
l wanted to show that to you...
Hence you are here.

1382
02:40:57,933 --> 02:41:03,538
See the decorations, guests...
everything is there.

1383
02:41:04,533 --> 02:41:06,167
Tell me how this marriage would stop?

1384
02:41:09,200 --> 02:41:10,200
''Muhurtam''- The auspicious moment..

1385
02:41:13,266 --> 02:41:18,938
The most essential part of the
marriage is ''Muhurtham''

1386
02:41:21,066 --> 02:41:27,338
People don't ask how much you'll spend
but will ask for Muhurtham.

1387
02:41:28,666 --> 02:41:29,666
This marriage do not have Muhurtham

1388
02:41:31,333 --> 02:41:39,340
You used to wish your daughter on her
birthday, exact on time...

1389
02:41:40,866 --> 02:41:43,134
You couldn't bless your daughter
for this marriage on time.

1390
02:41:47,500 --> 02:41:54,073
Birthday comes every year, but
marriage... only once.

1391
02:41:57,133 --> 02:42:01,737
Sir, what was the time of muhurtham?
- 10.42 a.m

1392
02:42:01,866 --> 02:42:08,305
What's the time now? It's okay tell me.
- It is 10.45 a.m

1393
02:42:11,600 --> 02:42:12,934
Marriage hasn't happened, as per
the time you had fixed.

1394
02:42:14,466 --> 02:42:19,137
lt's delayed by 3 minutes l didn't
stop it. You stopped it.

1395
02:42:20,600 --> 02:42:23,936
This means, that what you are doing is
wrong. You've already accepted it

1396
02:42:24,466 --> 02:42:26,601
You may now forcefully marry her off.

1397
02:42:26,766 --> 02:42:30,936
But you'll remember your mistake
on every walk of life.

1398
02:42:33,266 --> 02:42:38,204
Once you had told, l am not capable
enough to give invitation cards...

1399
02:42:38,333 --> 02:42:45,206
For a marriage, you just need
a place in bride's heart

1400
02:42:48,266 --> 02:42:50,434
l am not so rich to arrange
a marriage like this.

1401
02:42:50,600 --> 02:42:56,939
l can't earn immediately. Not only
me, many have similar problem

1402
02:42:57,100 --> 02:43:00,870
What to do? At the age to
Iove, we are unable to earn

1403
02:43:01,000 --> 02:43:05,604
When are capable of earning,
we don't have time to love

1404
02:43:07,600 --> 02:43:12,438
l am not trying to please you by my
words. l believe in action not words.

1405
02:43:16,200 --> 02:43:20,604
But one thing is true, we will know
if we are doing right or not...

1406
02:43:22,266 --> 02:43:25,135
Only we know... you know.

1407
02:43:58,633 --> 02:43:59,633
Then you withdrew?

1408
02:44:03,799 --> 02:44:04,800
Nothing happened...

1409
02:44:07,766 --> 02:44:08,766
Nobody spoke.

1410
02:44:09,266 --> 02:44:13,937
Be it my wife, my son, Sarathi...
nobody spoke.

1411
02:44:15,433 --> 02:44:18,602
Silence
Deadly silence.

1412
02:44:20,933 --> 02:44:22,934
l couldn't even hear
my daughter's cry.

1413
02:44:26,799 --> 02:44:28,935
l have seen love in her eyes for me

1414
02:44:30,600 --> 02:44:32,802
l have seen tears in her eyes for him

1415
02:44:33,799 --> 02:44:36,936
But on that day,
l saw anger in her eyes.

1416
02:44:39,133 --> 02:44:41,935
My Anju's eyes were filled with anger.

1417
02:44:44,799 --> 02:44:49,004
l did it, l got them married..
that's all

1418
02:44:57,266 --> 02:44:59,768
Love can make things happen.

1419
02:45:01,266 --> 02:45:05,670
Some times for our children's
happiness we'll have to part from them

1420
02:45:17,200 --> 02:45:19,268
You know where l want to
spend my first night?

1421
02:45:19,399 --> 02:45:20,400
l don't know.

1422
02:45:22,766 --> 02:45:26,603
ln cold winter... even the moon...

1423
02:45:28,200 --> 02:45:30,268
...is hiding in the clouds
due to the cold.

1424
02:45:31,766 --> 02:45:35,269
A candle lit at far...

1425
02:45:36,533 --> 02:45:40,336
You are so close to me that...
even cool breeze can't separate us.

1426
02:45:42,000 --> 02:45:43,000
That's the right place...

1427
02:45:46,000 --> 02:45:52,773
What are you thinking?
- l wondered how l'd raise a loan.
