1
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:34,875
Police system is a coin with two sides.

2
00:00:35,416 --> 00:00:38,333
One side is the law…
and the other is order.

3
00:00:39,166 --> 00:00:42,833
Sometimes to maintain order,
one needs to break the law.

4
00:00:43,583 --> 00:00:47,000
When order's maintained,
the system functions properly.

5
00:00:48,541 --> 00:00:51,541
But we didn't know any of this
in the Police Training Center.

6
00:00:52,291 --> 00:00:55,041
The real lesson on the system
was outside the syllabus.

7
00:00:55,333 --> 00:00:57,041
And our dean Vijay Singh

8
00:00:57,458 --> 00:00:59,166
taught us the A, B, C of it.

9
00:01:01,583 --> 00:01:04,083
Knee up. Knee up. Inline with your waist.

10
00:01:11,958 --> 00:01:13,583
The future Bombay police.

11
00:01:14,333 --> 00:01:17,041
You can't even qualify
as fake police in films.

12
00:01:17,125 --> 00:01:21,166
By the way, this is not dean Vijay Singh.

13
00:01:21,833 --> 00:01:24,375
He is our PT and Weapon's Instructor,

14
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,083
-Mangesh Dixit.
-Fire!

15
00:01:36,375 --> 00:01:37,708
Detail,

16
00:01:37,791 --> 00:01:38,708
five rounds.

17
00:01:39,208 --> 00:01:41,583
Application. Fire!

18
00:01:46,791 --> 00:01:48,583
If you manage to get a warrant

19
00:01:48,666 --> 00:01:51,583
before a raid or arrest,
then consider it your lucky day.

20
00:01:52,583 --> 00:01:55,000
Crime and criminals are uninvited guests.

21
00:01:55,666 --> 00:01:57,166
No time to get a warrant.

22
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:00,833
But the lack of search warrant
can go against us in the court.

23
00:02:00,916 --> 00:02:04,583
-And this is our Law Professor, YP Mathur.
-For example…

24
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:07,416
A taxi was parked in the no-parking zone
in front of a motel.

25
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,000
A woman came out of the motel...

26
00:02:09,083 --> 00:02:10,958
and climbed in the back seat of the taxi.

27
00:02:11,708 --> 00:02:16,083
A man crosses the road and gets in the
back seat of the taxi as well.

28
00:02:16,166 --> 00:02:18,750
Two sub-inspectors noticed the movement

29
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:21,791
and searched the taxi
in order to investigate.

30
00:02:22,458 --> 00:02:25,625
They found weed in the taxi.
So, what do you think...

31
00:02:26,083 --> 00:02:27,291
the court ruled and why?

32
00:02:34,416 --> 00:02:35,375
Shukla!

33
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:41,750
Sir!

34
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:46,125
-Weed in the taxi.
-Oh yes.

35
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:47,916
Weed, sir,

36
00:02:48,541 --> 00:02:52,125
the policemen could have
planted the weed in the taxi,

37
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:53,500
to make a case.

38
00:02:53,583 --> 00:02:55,375
Stop talking like a police officer!

39
00:02:56,458 --> 00:02:57,875
Because you're not one yet.

40
00:02:58,833 --> 00:03:00,583
This is class, not a joke.

41
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:06,375
Varde. Speak up.

42
00:03:06,916 --> 00:03:08,583
What did you want to say?

43
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:11,416
Sir, we can't search them
based on parking violation.

44
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,458
Contraband was found in the taxi,
and not with any of the accused.

45
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:18,708
But I never said that they found the weed
in the taxi or the vehicle

46
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:20,541
and not with the accused.

47
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:23,333
Sir, you  just said, "weed in the taxi".

48
00:03:23,583 --> 00:03:25,166
Sir, this case is Vakil Khan versus

49
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:26,916
-the state of Maharashtra.
-Do you know about this case?

50
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,875
Yes, sir. I read it in the library.

51
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,666
This is not a Law school.

52
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:36,625
Mugging up the case is not the objective. 

53
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:39,166
-Analysis should be on the stop.
-Spot sir!

54
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:42,708
On the spot, sir.

55
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:46,583
All you’re good at
is correcting the lecturers.

56
00:03:46,666 --> 00:03:47,958
But not yourself.

57
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:53,416
So, listen, class…

58
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:57,375
The dean was supposed to
take the next class, but he won't.

59
00:03:57,458 --> 00:03:58,833
And this is me,

60
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:02,208
Cadet Aslam Khan.
Third bench from the last row,

61
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:04,500
almost a back bencher in the class of '83.

62
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,750
Dean Vijay Singh's first batch.

63
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:11,875
Our first semester was nearly over,

64
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:16,000
but no Cadet had ever seen dean
Vijay Singh on campus.

65
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:17,791
Bye. Here you go.

66
00:04:17,916 --> 00:04:20,333
He didn't take a single lecture.

67
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:22,833
Shukla! Take one. All the way from home.

68
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:25,291
We just got our very first telephone.

69
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:30,291
I'm jerking off.
I hope you don't mind dirty hands.

70
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:32,750
Asshole.
These blankets are rotated frequently.

71
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:36,583
And the new dean, Mr. Singh,
pays no focus on the Academy.

72
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:38,333
I wonder if the blankets ever get washed.

73
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:41,083
You guys never let me concentrate.

74
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:46,125
Wanker!

75
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:47,750
Shukla!

76
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:51,000
It's bad luck to jerk off
the night before the exams.

77
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:52,583
What?

78
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:01,000
Singh was a veteran officer
of Mumbai Police.

79
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:03,291
He eliminated many criminal gangs.

80
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:07,166
Why would he be rotting here as the Dean
if he was that good?

81
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:09,583
He must be on punishment posting.

82
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:12,541
Let it be. It doesn't really matter to us.

83
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:16,500
It did matter to us.

84
00:05:17,541 --> 00:05:18,833
We were scared.

85
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:22,875
Dean sir might not have taken
a single lecture, but...

86
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,750
we were all scared
about the Dean's evaluation.

87
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:40,166
Shukla.

88
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:43,166
Right on the bullseye.

89
00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:46,875
But my instructions were
one bullet  on the bottom left,

90
00:05:46,958 --> 00:05:49,083
and another one on the bottom right.

91
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:51,708
Bullseye is after all bullseye, sir.

92
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:53,583
You dimwit.

93
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:58,083
On the field, you're supposed to shoot

94
00:05:58,916 --> 00:06:00,875
only to disarm and not kill.

95
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:03,541
Varde!

96
00:06:05,791 --> 00:06:10,666
Your target chart reminds me
of my mother's crochet knitting.

97
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:14,458
The criminal will end up
paralyzed for life.

98
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:15,541
Next!

99
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:19,333
Come...

100
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:21,500
-Mr. Jadhav.
-Sir!

101
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:23,958
What were you aiming at exactly?

102
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:28,625
Such wastage of government funds.
What exactly were you trying to do?

103
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:30,208
Very good!

104
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:35,416
Vishnu Varde.

105
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:43,583
This is a review of your first semester.

106
00:06:44,708 --> 00:06:48,125
All the cadets are assessed
on a total of 50 marks.

107
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:50,791
In your case, with the dean's marks...

108
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:52,750
-But the Dean was missing again.
-...and remarks.

109
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:55,875
Sometimes I felt that
the training center administration

110
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:58,416
floated a rumor to scare the cadets

111
00:06:59,125 --> 00:07:02,666
that Vijay Singh's been appointed
as the new dean.

112
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:05,708
So...

113
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:07,791
you, me and Aslam

114
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,291
topped the first semester.

115
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:13,208
-Top?
-From the bottom.

116
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:15,125
The glass is half full.
Change your perspective.

117
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:18,541
-Correct.
-Two more have joined our ranks.

118
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:20,166
Jadhav...

119
00:07:20,416 --> 00:07:23,125
-and the other guy…
-Surve…

120
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:26,750
Who cares if there's a dozen of them?
I wanted good marks for myself.

121
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:30,291
I have a rich father.

122
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:31,833
So even if I fail,

123
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:33,791
I still have my family business.
I'll take that up.

124
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:35,541
Technically, we haven't failed yet.

125
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:37,708
We managed to barely graze through.

126
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:39,791
Honestly, I would have scored
better marks,

127
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:42,791
if Dixit wasn't always screwing with my…

128
00:07:43,583 --> 00:07:45,750
He shatters your
self-confidence completely.

129
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,458
Let's go break Dixit's balls.

130
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,041
Do you want us to get rusticated?

131
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:54,625
Only if we get caught.

132
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:57,708
And who cares even if we do get caught.

133
00:07:58,958 --> 00:08:00,500
We aren't exactly ideal students.

134
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:03,875
Bottoms up.

135
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:16,166
-Let's do it.
-Bravo!

136
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:19,166
-What about you?
-Will you give me a job?

137
00:08:20,916 --> 00:08:22,125
Done!

138
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:10,500
Dean and Dixit got a whiff of
Shukla's great plan.

139
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:14,250
We had this great desire
that the dean teaches us.

140
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:18,125
And he finally taught us a lesson.
Quite literally.

141
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:23,958
Dean's entry
was like a villain's entry in our life.

142
00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:32,166
IPC Section 107-117.

143
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:35,833
When two or more people plan

144
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:37,750
to execute a crime.

145
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:45,333
You, you, and you.

146
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,958
Your faces indicate you three
were involved in some kind of incident.

147
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:56,625
We haven't done anything, sir.

148
00:09:56,708 --> 00:09:58,541
That is what every criminal says.

149
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:03,833
And the police's job us to establish a
connection between the alleged criminals.

150
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:06,041
And this,

151
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:09,208
is the exact fact that criminals
try to conceal.

152
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:15,125
If anyone from the classroom would like
to interrogate them, feel free to do so.

153
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:17,958
Sir!

154
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:21,541
Sir!

155
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:24,458
Aslam,

156
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,875
how did you get these bruises
on your face?

157
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:31,083
Sir!

158
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:35,333
Last night,
I woke up to go to the bathroom.

159
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:38,666
But due to the rains and wet surface…

160
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:39,583
-So...
-Sir.

161
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:46,250
Did Shukla tag along with you
to the bathroom?

162
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:48,833
No, I am quite capable on my own.

163
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,666
Because Shukla has a bruised face as well.

164
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,875
What were your whereabouts
last night, Shukla?

165
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:58,333
Few anti-social elements
took advantage of the deluge

166
00:10:58,416 --> 00:11:00,541
and tried to enter the campus premises.
And we…

167
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:02,041
Any alibi?

168
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:02,958
Me.

169
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:09,875
Sir, when I saw Shukla tackling the
attackers, I jumped right in to save him.

170
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:14,083
What motive would the intruders have
to infiltrate the training camp?

171
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:17,000
To steal our arms and ammunition, sir.
Our training weapon.

172
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:18,833
And did the intruders tell you this?

173
00:11:18,916 --> 00:11:22,125
No! But that's the only thing worth
stealing here, sir.

174
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:25,291
Then why didn't you raise an alarm?
You should've alerted the guard.

175
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:26,833
We did. We tried doing that.

176
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:29,708
But unfortunately,
no one heard us in the deluge.

177
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:32,333
And where did this scuffle take place?

178
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:33,791
-PT ground.
-PT ground.

179
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:37,750
Sir, their night suits should
be investigated.

180
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:40,833
If, according to them,
the struggle took place in the PT ground,

181
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:43,583
their night suits should've
traces of mud from last night.

182
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:47,125
Yes, sir. If they are telling the truth,
we'll definitely find stains.

183
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:51,666
You'll find different kinds of stains
on Shukla's clothes, sir.

184
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,208
So, Shukla, Aslam and Varde…

185
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:58,958
Shall we check your night suits?

186
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:02,375
Sir…

187
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:04,541
Sir, we are sorry.

188
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:06,166
We lied.

189
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:07,875
Sorry.

190
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:16,708
If your motive was to lie, you should
have soiled your night suits first.

191
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:19,833
That would have saved you from
getting caught in the investigation.

192
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:22,041
Sit down.

193
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:52,750
Rohan's second-term form.

194
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:54,583
Sign on the dotted lines.

195
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:02,125
He wanted to join the police
when he was a kid.

196
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:08,750
But the police department isn't
what it used to be.

197
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:13,958
Politicians are providing safe-haven
to gangsters and criminals.

198
00:13:14,916 --> 00:13:16,541
Tell me something I don't know.

199
00:13:18,708 --> 00:13:20,500
Yeah, but the

200
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:22,666
fresh recruits nowadays are smarter.

201
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:26,791
They come mentally prepared
for corruption.

202
00:13:27,291 --> 00:13:28,708
Right from their graduation.

203
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:31,875
They are not romantic fools like us

204
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:33,750
who set out from the academy
armed with idealism.

205
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:36,750
I tried to commit suicide.

206
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,458
Have you heard about the 50-crore club?

207
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:41,083
Twice.

208
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:44,833
I couldn't handle this punishment posting,

209
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:47,500
Sudha's death.

210
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:52,750
Fifteen crores?

211
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,166
Are you out of your mind?

212
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:56,791
You just said 15 crores.

213
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,375
I…

214
00:13:58,875 --> 00:14:02,000
I said 50 crores. 50.
But that's not what I am talking about.

215
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,708
I was talking about your suicide attempt.

216
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:08,125
It was just a phase. It's over.

217
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:09,166
Is it?

218
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:12,500
It's not safe for you out here.

219
00:14:13,291 --> 00:14:15,333
-Just resign.
-I said…

220
00:14:15,916 --> 00:14:16,750
It's over.

221
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:28,625
A guy like you who loves fieldwork
can only get frustrated out here.

222
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,333
Anyway…

223
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:36,625
You don't know how lucky you are.

224
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:38,000
Lucky?

225
00:14:38,541 --> 00:14:39,416
Me?

226
00:14:40,291 --> 00:14:41,541
Are you being sarcastic?

227
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:47,208
Out here, you get to see future policemen
at their purest.

228
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:51,166
Untouched by departmental politics
and corruption.

229
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:54,666
They're like wet clay.
You can shape them the way you want.

230
00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:59,458
But you just said that the cadets
these days are smarter

231
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:00,750
and corrupt.

232
00:15:02,041 --> 00:15:03,958
There are always dark horses around.

233
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:08,000
Where will I find those dark horses
and romantics now?

234
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:11,708
Sir!

235
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:16,625
Nilesha ma'am sent these files for you.

236
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:18,375
-Thank you!
-Sir!

237
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:28,166
In Bombay Police I mostly find more
middlemen dressed as policemen.

238
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,666
Well seasoned game players.

239
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,750
To protect the good and destroy the evil!

240
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:25,875
-Will you promise me something?
-What?

241
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:28,916
If anything happens to me…

242
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:29,958
Don't…

243
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:31,208
Let me finish.

244
00:16:32,416 --> 00:16:34,083
Never dye your hair black.

245
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:38,375
Grey is beginning to suit you.

246
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:47,875
Sir...

247
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:55,958
Nurse, wait.

248
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:02,208
Go, take the call.

249
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:04,875
It's not urgent.

250
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:06,333
Really?

251
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:09,625
Then why did you leave
the hospital's number with someone?

252
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:16,625
Go, take the call.

253
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:19,666
Where am I running away?

254
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:31,875
Hello.

255
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:33,291
Sotya speaking, sir.

256
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:35,791
Sotya. Go ahead.

257
00:17:36,416 --> 00:17:38,375
Your hunch was correct, sir.

258
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:41,125
They are meeting out in the sea.

259
00:17:41,541 --> 00:17:43,208
Kalsekar is on his way too.

260
00:17:57,708 --> 00:17:59,166
Rohan, tell your father

261
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:01,750
to go do his job.

262
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:04,375
He is not listening to me.

263
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:09,708
Don't you want him to be here
during your operation?

264
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:12,666
I've already said what I want.

265
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:17,958
At home, I am the boss.

266
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:39,833
I was only shaving
and not trying to kill myself.

267
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:41,791
Might as well kill yourself.

268
00:18:42,458 --> 00:18:44,791
You are hardly seen
around the academy anyway.

269
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,541
I will haunt this academy.

270
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:49,208
And possess you.

271
00:18:49,708 --> 00:18:51,041
Victory to thee, O'Hanuman!
Ocean of wisdom

272
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:52,666
All hail to you O'Kapisa

273
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:54,666
Why did you call me?

274
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:57,916
I asked for the files
of those five lowest-ranking cadets.

275
00:18:58,916 --> 00:19:02,208
I thought I should review these once
before rusticating them.

276
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:04,291
You seem to have a lot of idle time, sir.

277
00:19:04,375 --> 00:19:09,208
I don't think these five
need to become Policemen.

278
00:19:09,708 --> 00:19:11,875
Of course they don’t want to.
Else, they would have strived harder.

279
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,708
In the classroom, at the PT ground…

280
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:15,833
I said they don't need to
become Policemen.

281
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:17,833
But they want to for sure...

282
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:23,416
Without bowing to the system,
or to you and me.

283
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:25,625
Then, I don't know what to say.

284
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:28,333
I was just like them in the academy.

285
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,625
In fact, all the cadets
used to be like them back then.

286
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:34,625
Yes, all the cadets
used to be like them back then.

287
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:38,333
Then don’t let them continue here...

288
00:19:38,416 --> 00:19:41,041
Or some day they will be transferred here.

289
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:45,166
On punishment posting.

290
00:19:47,791 --> 00:19:50,000
Better rusticate them.

291
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:51,791
You are so negative.

292
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:55,041
What can I do?
Negative is in my blood group.

293
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:57,750
What can I do either? I am B Positive.

294
00:19:59,416 --> 00:20:02,291
-Hence, I want to give a shot.
-To all the five?

295
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:03,916
To myself.

296
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:09,833
As an experiment, I want these five
to enter the police body as anti-bodies.

297
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:13,375
Like a vaccine that counters disease.

298
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:17,541
It will be illegal
to train any candidate separately.

299
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:19,625
We can improvise the syllabus slightly...

300
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:22,000
and teach the entire class together.

301
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:24,083
But the effect will only be on these five.

302
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:27,375
I pity for you, sir.

303
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:30,583
You and your experiments.

304
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:33,208
These test tubes are going to
blow off in your face.

305
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:38,791
One-two-one-two-one...

306
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:42,583
On the field, running after the criminal
is your job. Understood?

307
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:48,458
I want to see your knees
inline with your waist

308
00:20:48,541 --> 00:20:52,875
-and energy. Come on, cadets! Come on!
-Everybody on your feet, fast!

309
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:57,500
Get into groups of three.

310
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:01,833
Dixit will play the criminal
for this exercise.

311
00:21:01,916 --> 00:21:05,041
Every group must complete
three steps in 15 seconds.

312
00:21:06,083 --> 00:21:08,291
First, make him kneel

313
00:21:08,625 --> 00:21:10,041
or lie flat on his stomach.

314
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:13,250
Second, restrain his hands at the back.

315
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:16,750
And third, lock the handcuffs.

316
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:38,625
Next!

317
00:22:09,375 --> 00:22:12,083
The matter didn't end
after the beating we got that night...

318
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:14,666
We were to be battered, and…

319
00:22:15,458 --> 00:22:16,875
humiliated.

320
00:22:18,583 --> 00:22:20,208
But Dean's style was different.

321
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:22,375
Dean was a syllabus unto himself.

322
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:26,250
He built up self-confidence
in the five of us.

323
00:22:26,375 --> 00:22:29,625
We were made to think
outside our boring books.

324
00:22:38,125 --> 00:22:40,083
One, two!

325
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:44,708
Go!

326
00:22:57,375 --> 00:22:59,958
There were many rumors about the dean
in our batch.

327
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:03,458
Some said that the dean's informer network
was faster than a computer.

328
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:09,375
Some said that when dean gets angry,
a volcano erupts somewhere.

329
00:23:10,375 --> 00:23:13,833
But there was no rumor about the Dean
being an inhabitant of Jupiter.

330
00:23:56,916 --> 00:23:59,416
Now, I can't do anything. It's gone now.
It's over.

331
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:06,666
-Hello.
-Vijay, speaking.

332
00:24:08,416 --> 00:24:09,333
How is Sudha?

333
00:24:09,416 --> 00:24:12,166
Kalsekar is going ahead for
a meeting to strike a big deal.

334
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:16,291
What do I do with him?

335
00:24:17,791 --> 00:24:19,458
How can you leave Sudha alone

336
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:21,291
in her condition?

337
00:24:27,291 --> 00:24:28,375
Get him alive.

338
00:26:47,458 --> 00:26:49,083
Is Kalsekar's body among them?

339
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:55,958
No.

340
00:26:57,333 --> 00:26:58,750
But he was here.

341
00:28:05,333 --> 00:28:06,833
Are you going back to the hostel?

342
00:28:07,791 --> 00:28:09,541
Please stay for a few more days.

343
00:28:15,458 --> 00:28:17,791
You didn't stay even for a minute
for mother.

344
00:28:18,791 --> 00:28:21,208
Let me know when are we
supposed to immerse her ashes.

345
00:29:05,375 --> 00:29:08,083
At any crime scene, your eyes will see

346
00:29:09,333 --> 00:29:11,041
what the criminal wants to show you.

347
00:29:12,875 --> 00:29:14,333
And what a criminal hides

348
00:29:15,541 --> 00:29:16,583
is the truth.

349
00:29:18,416 --> 00:29:20,916
This gap between hide and seek

350
00:29:21,958 --> 00:29:24,083
makes or breaks cases in the court.

351
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,208
Thirty minutes.

352
00:29:27,291 --> 00:29:29,833
After that, the body has to be
sent back to the mortuary.

353
00:29:36,416 --> 00:29:39,625
Not a single lesson taught by the dean
was on the question paper.

354
00:29:40,375 --> 00:29:43,291
The other cadets
turned out to be smarter than us.

355
00:29:43,875 --> 00:29:46,500
They had mugged up theory
instead of dean's lectures.

356
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:50,375
Shukla came for the exam
without jerking off.

357
00:29:50,875 --> 00:29:53,083
To avoid any bad luck.

358
00:29:56,958 --> 00:29:58,833
-Happy new year, sir.
-Happy new year.

359
00:30:01,416 --> 00:30:03,083
Happy new year, sir.

360
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:05,750
-Happy new year, sir.
-Happy new year, sir.

361
00:30:07,708 --> 00:30:12,125
Sir, when we had joined the academy,
we wanted to learn a lot from you.

362
00:30:12,875 --> 00:30:17,166
-You're an inspiration to us, sir.
-I see. What is so special about me?

363
00:30:17,916 --> 00:30:21,208
Sir, during your posting in Bombay,
you wiped out many gangsters.

364
00:30:21,291 --> 00:30:22,125
Yes.

365
00:30:22,333 --> 00:30:24,250
You boys read a lot of newspapers
it seems.

366
00:30:25,208 --> 00:30:27,625
Learning under you is
nothing short of an honor, sir.

367
00:30:28,916 --> 00:30:31,916
You think you are honoring me by
scoring the lowest in your class?

368
00:30:34,208 --> 00:30:36,958
So far whatever second-semester papers
I have assessed...

369
00:30:37,416 --> 00:30:39,875
you boys are going to
score the lowest again.

370
00:30:43,625 --> 00:30:45,916
Sorry for disturbing you, sir.

371
00:30:47,583 --> 00:30:49,041
-Wait a minute.
-Yes, sir.

372
00:30:49,791 --> 00:30:52,458
-Do you boys know about cleaning up?
-What, sir?

373
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:04,708
People say the last day of the year

374
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:07,708
is a reflection
of your days to come in the new year.

375
00:31:08,833 --> 00:31:10,458
Surve, grab my sweater.

376
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,291
You three...

377
00:31:25,875 --> 00:31:28,083
could have been rusticated

378
00:31:28,375 --> 00:31:29,583
for entering my home that stormy night.

379
00:31:30,458 --> 00:31:31,375
Do you know?

380
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:33,333
We know, sir.

381
00:31:34,708 --> 00:31:38,416
But for us, our friendship...
mattered first.

382
00:31:39,583 --> 00:31:42,083
And it also mattered
that we should fear none.

383
00:31:42,166 --> 00:31:43,208
Not even...

384
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,125
our teachers.

385
00:31:46,833 --> 00:31:48,458
All bodies have an immune system.

386
00:31:49,541 --> 00:31:51,916
Government bodies, educational bodies,

387
00:31:52,083 --> 00:31:53,458
judicial bodies…

388
00:31:53,958 --> 00:31:55,250
These are strong fortresses.

389
00:31:55,833 --> 00:31:58,166
And their immune system is so strong

390
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:01,000
that any attack from the outside
never affects them.

391
00:32:01,875 --> 00:32:04,750
They need to be rotted from the inside,
like a disease.

392
00:32:04,833 --> 00:32:08,000
Sir, if any of this was possible,
wouldn't you have already done it?

393
00:32:09,541 --> 00:32:11,541
I burnt my hands by mistake.

394
00:32:13,041 --> 00:32:15,625
But you should not repeat
the mistakes I made.

395
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,333
Six of our brave officers died

396
00:32:21,458 --> 00:32:24,250
in their effort to apprehend
international smugglers.

397
00:32:25,541 --> 00:32:27,208
And I promise you

398
00:32:27,833 --> 00:32:30,000
that those who are guilty

399
00:32:30,083 --> 00:32:32,250
will be brought to justice.

400
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:59,375
Our chief minister
Mr. Manohar Patkar has always

401
00:32:59,458 --> 00:33:03,875
supported the police department
of this state.

402
00:33:04,375 --> 00:33:06,875
I request the wives of the six  martyrs

403
00:33:07,208 --> 00:33:09,125
to come on stage...

404
00:33:10,375 --> 00:33:14,208
so mister minister  could present them
with a cheque of rupees 100,000 each.

405
00:33:15,125 --> 00:33:18,541
First I would like to call
the brave wife of

406
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:21,583
sub-Inspector Siddesh Naresh Sawant.

407
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:24,208
Kalsekar knew we were coming.

408
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:28,583
He fled in a hurry
without even putting out his cigarette.

409
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:36,500
Did someone tip him off?

410
00:33:37,291 --> 00:33:40,958
I was the only one who knew
about operation against Kalsekar?

411
00:33:42,375 --> 00:33:43,416
Then who?

412
00:33:44,583 --> 00:33:48,291
And the only other person I told about
the operation against Kalsekar was you.

413
00:34:14,416 --> 00:34:17,041
These are the key members
of Kalsekar's gang.

414
00:34:25,541 --> 00:34:27,416
Killing them

415
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,916
is like saving Bombay from a disease.

416
00:34:31,375 --> 00:34:32,791
And killing them

417
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:35,583
without drawing Patkar's attention

418
00:34:36,375 --> 00:34:38,458
is like winning a war.

419
00:34:39,458 --> 00:34:42,541
Patkar has always protected
gangsters like Kalsekar.

420
00:34:43,958 --> 00:34:45,041
His entire gang

421
00:34:45,375 --> 00:34:47,125
thrives because of Patkar.

422
00:34:47,958 --> 00:34:52,125
Every policeman in the state
is scared of Patkar's punishment posting.

423
00:34:52,916 --> 00:34:54,750
That's why no police officer

424
00:34:54,833 --> 00:34:57,958
dares to lay a finger on Kalsekar
or his gang members.

425
00:35:00,833 --> 00:35:03,625
When CBI planned a raid to
apprehend Kalsekar…

426
00:35:04,916 --> 00:35:07,875
it was Patkar who leaked this
internal information to him.

427
00:35:09,291 --> 00:35:11,000
Kalsekar escaped...

428
00:35:11,708 --> 00:35:13,250
...leaving India forever.

429
00:35:14,666 --> 00:35:17,625
Soon his gang members fled too.

430
00:35:24,916 --> 00:35:26,583
You have the will to kill,

431
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:30,625
but out on the field, what matters
is the skill to survive.

432
00:35:30,833 --> 00:35:32,375
You are loyal friends,

433
00:35:32,583 --> 00:35:33,916
but also honest.

434
00:35:35,041 --> 00:35:37,541
You break rules, but not principles.

435
00:35:38,708 --> 00:35:40,833
You fail but on your own terms.

436
00:35:42,625 --> 00:35:45,208
If these weaknesses remain your assets...

437
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:48,125
and if you continue
to remain loyal friends…

438
00:35:50,916 --> 00:35:54,625
Then I'll eagerly wait right here to
hear about what you do out in the field.

439
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:58,833
Our Maharashtra state
has Police Force of 60,000.

440
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,166
And from today you will all be
part of this formidable Force.

441
00:36:05,458 --> 00:36:08,625
From now, the responsibility of
protecting the citizens of Maharashtra

442
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:09,916
is on your shoulders.

443
00:36:10,041 --> 00:36:14,375
I want to congratulate all of you
on your graduation.

444
00:36:14,916 --> 00:36:17,916
And I would like to request your dean

445
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:21,500
to say a few words.

446
00:36:31,208 --> 00:36:34,916
Our respected Chief Minister
has given me this opportunity

447
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,583
to share my experience with you

448
00:36:37,666 --> 00:36:39,750
and for that, I am grateful to him.

449
00:36:40,583 --> 00:36:43,250
Minister Patkar has worked for the
betterment of our state.

450
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:47,958
Thanks to minister Patkar's encouragement,
every policeman

451
00:36:48,041 --> 00:36:50,666
of our state
fights criminals without any fear.

452
00:36:52,583 --> 00:36:56,625
First platoon march forward...
in quick steps. One... two...

453
00:36:57,958 --> 00:37:01,000
First platoon look right.

454
00:37:05,958 --> 00:37:07,916
Dean's faith in us

455
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,916
was a big burden on my heart.

456
00:37:10,541 --> 00:37:13,208
It must have laid heavy
on the rest of my friends as well.

457
00:37:13,916 --> 00:37:15,958
Dean had taught us
the A...B...C of the system.

458
00:37:17,458 --> 00:37:18,708
But now

459
00:37:18,791 --> 00:37:20,666
life was going to test us.

460
00:37:21,416 --> 00:37:23,000
And it wasn't going to be easy.

461
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:27,708
And life can be more cruel 
than any Vijay Singh.

462
00:37:54,916 --> 00:37:55,750
Bombay.

463
00:37:56,750 --> 00:37:59,416
This city was nothing
short of a battlefield.

464
00:38:00,041 --> 00:38:02,583
The city's backbone were the cotton mills,

465
00:38:02,833 --> 00:38:05,541
Where labour strikes were more frequent
than the usual work.

466
00:38:06,125 --> 00:38:09,375
The real fight was between Indira Gandhi
and trade union leader Datta Samant.

467
00:38:10,833 --> 00:38:12,083
And the collateral damages...

468
00:38:12,708 --> 00:38:15,125
...were 250,000 mill workers
and their families.

469
00:38:15,333 --> 00:38:21,250
-Out Cotton Loom is our Birthright!
-It's not your private Heirloom!

470
00:38:21,333 --> 00:38:24,000
Out Cotton Loom is our Birthright!

471
00:38:24,083 --> 00:38:25,958
And the mess didn't end there.

472
00:38:26,041 --> 00:38:30,291
Terrorism is at its peak in Punjab...

473
00:38:30,375 --> 00:38:32,583
And terrorists were smuggling in
weapons and explosives via Bombay Port.

474
00:38:33,875 --> 00:38:36,083
Fresh on  postings, we soon realized  that

475
00:38:36,958 --> 00:38:38,958
Bombay was the underworld's circus,

476
00:38:39,041 --> 00:38:41,000
and Kalsekar its ringmaster.

477
00:38:41,916 --> 00:38:44,250
On top of that unemployed young children
from mill workers’ families

478
00:38:44,333 --> 00:38:45,458
were also taking to crime.

479
00:38:46,041 --> 00:38:48,416
The prominent one among them
was Naik gang.

480
00:38:48,708 --> 00:38:51,166
The entire city was sitting
on a pile of gunpowder.

481
00:38:51,791 --> 00:38:52,666
All it needed

482
00:38:52,875 --> 00:38:54,708
was someone to strike a matchstick.

483
00:39:03,916 --> 00:39:07,291
Dean Singh was perhaps waiting in Nashik
to hear about our field achievements.

484
00:39:07,916 --> 00:39:09,916
But we newly posted officers

485
00:39:10,166 --> 00:39:11,916
were like the 12th man in cricket.

486
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,166
Whiling away in Control room,
or at airport.

487
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:16,875
Or rotting as some minister’s
family’s personal security.

488
00:39:16,958 --> 00:39:17,916
Raman Singh.

489
00:39:18,208 --> 00:39:19,458
Vishnu Varde.

490
00:39:20,041 --> 00:39:21,541
-You are with Delhi Police?
-Yes!

491
00:39:21,625 --> 00:39:23,333
Almost back-benchers in police system.

492
00:39:23,416 --> 00:39:26,458
The tourism minister is in Bombay
for some work.

493
00:39:26,541 --> 00:39:28,000
He has brought his son along too.

494
00:39:28,791 --> 00:39:30,166
The young man's partying.

495
00:39:31,583 --> 00:39:32,541
So, Varde.

496
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,916
Word in your circle is that you're
being assigned to some decent post.

497
00:39:40,875 --> 00:39:41,791
I don't know.

498
00:39:43,833 --> 00:39:46,000
But if it's true,
I am going to miss you all.

499
00:39:46,625 --> 00:39:49,833
Like hell, he is going to miss us. Good.

500
00:40:16,916 --> 00:40:18,625
-Shukla sir.
-What?

501
00:40:18,708 --> 00:40:20,083
ACP sir is calling you.

502
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:22,833
I'm coming.

503
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:37,333
-Shukla?
-Sir!

504
00:40:37,875 --> 00:40:40,500
Your colleagues claim
that you have a great aim.

505
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:43,166
Thank you, sir.

506
00:40:44,333 --> 00:40:48,458
The department is thinking of giving you
some solid work instead of regular duty.

507
00:40:49,291 --> 00:40:50,125
Sir.

508
00:40:51,125 --> 00:40:52,041
What's in the file?

509
00:40:53,541 --> 00:40:55,541
Paperwork, sir. Routine paperwork.

510
00:40:57,583 --> 00:40:58,500
Look, Shukla...

511
00:40:59,708 --> 00:41:01,666
-remember one thing.
-Sir.

512
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:03,541
No matter what you do,

513
00:41:04,541 --> 00:41:06,208
never let any blemish
come to your uniform.

514
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,708
Don't put the department's honor at stake.

515
00:41:11,375 --> 00:41:12,750
-Right?
-Sir.

516
00:41:13,958 --> 00:41:16,416
-Great.
-Sir.

517
00:41:26,041 --> 00:41:29,083
Rohan. Oh, God! Put me down.

518
00:41:30,958 --> 00:41:32,541
Who did this? Hold this.

519
00:41:33,375 --> 00:41:35,125
Of course. Yours, truly.

520
00:41:35,208 --> 00:41:36,291
It's a bad knot.

521
00:41:48,833 --> 00:41:52,375
First mills owners were using
gangsters against workers

522
00:41:53,458 --> 00:41:55,166
to disrupt labour strikes

523
00:41:55,250 --> 00:41:56,625
and to kill union leaders.

524
00:41:57,416 --> 00:42:01,458
And now, a conflict of interest has
erupted between mill owners and gangsters.

525
00:42:01,958 --> 00:42:05,125
Because the real estate value
of mill land is hitting the sky.

526
00:42:06,291 --> 00:42:10,125
Do you remember the lecture on organized
crime that we read in our Academy days?

527
00:42:10,791 --> 00:42:12,833
I am not the one
who ended up as a teacher.

528
00:42:15,708 --> 00:42:18,291
Gangsters organize their setup
in such a way,

529
00:42:18,916 --> 00:42:23,083
so that no evidence trail leads back
to the bosses of the gang.

530
00:42:23,625 --> 00:42:26,375
The Police gets their hands only on
low level gang workers and sharpshooters.

531
00:42:26,458 --> 00:42:27,375
So?

532
00:42:28,583 --> 00:42:31,125
Why can't the police follow
the same model?

533
00:42:31,916 --> 00:42:32,875
How?

534
00:42:33,583 --> 00:42:36,416
Bombay police needs a squad.

535
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:39,916
It will consist of officers from
sub-inspectors, inspectors ranks

536
00:42:40,666 --> 00:42:43,791
And these officers will have the freedom
to kill gangsters without

537
00:42:44,291 --> 00:42:46,750
any restriction of jurisdiction.

538
00:42:48,375 --> 00:42:50,125
And their seniors will get

539
00:42:50,458 --> 00:42:53,208
punishment posting or suspension.

540
00:42:54,375 --> 00:42:55,500
Like you did.

541
00:42:56,875 --> 00:43:00,750
Only if the evidence trail leads
to the top brass of the department.

542
00:43:01,458 --> 00:43:04,500
The institutionalized killing 
of gangsters by policemen.

543
00:43:05,791 --> 00:43:06,791
Here's what I think.

544
00:43:07,375 --> 00:43:08,416
You should write a novel.

545
00:43:09,833 --> 00:43:10,875
Or your biography.

546
00:43:11,375 --> 00:43:13,625
What are you doing? Hey!

547
00:43:15,958 --> 00:43:18,166
-Say yes.
-Come on. No!

548
00:43:20,791 --> 00:43:23,625
-Promise me that you'll think about this.
-Never.

549
00:43:24,125 --> 00:43:26,916
Look, if I stand, you'll fall.

550
00:43:27,541 --> 00:43:30,208
Vijay, don't be childish.
I already have a dislocated hip.

551
00:43:30,291 --> 00:43:31,750
Put me down, please.

552
00:43:34,666 --> 00:43:36,958
It's a swing,
not the weighing scale of the law.

553
00:43:37,166 --> 00:43:38,000
Raghav,

554
00:43:38,666 --> 00:43:41,125
Kalsekar's monopoly won't last so long.

555
00:43:41,708 --> 00:43:44,791
Naik gang and other such children
of  other unemployed mill workers...

556
00:43:45,583 --> 00:43:47,333
are going to organize
their criminal outfits soon.

557
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:51,166
Kalsekar is not a part of our
police department's syllabus anymore.

558
00:43:51,250 --> 00:43:53,333
Patkar tore that chapter out.

559
00:44:05,583 --> 00:44:07,666
-Fish is delicious.
-Yes!

560
00:44:09,291 --> 00:44:10,250
Wow!

561
00:44:14,666 --> 00:44:15,666
What happened to your forehead?

562
00:44:16,583 --> 00:44:18,125
The Kohinoor Mill lockout.

563
00:44:18,666 --> 00:44:20,791
The workers resorted to stone pelting.

564
00:44:21,083 --> 00:44:23,041
Hey, get some sauce.

565
00:44:23,916 --> 00:44:25,458
Bunch of imbeciles.

566
00:44:25,541 --> 00:44:29,166
-They will all die, the stone pelters.
-What did you mean?

567
00:44:30,541 --> 00:44:32,916
Varde, you do know
that my father is a mill worker.

568
00:44:34,708 --> 00:44:38,166
The mill owners duped workers
of millions worth of their wages.

569
00:44:39,250 --> 00:44:41,791
Correction, not the mill owners,
the union leaders duped them.

570
00:44:41,875 --> 00:44:43,541
And the workers took no time

571
00:44:43,625 --> 00:44:46,208
in raising the communist flag.

572
00:44:48,583 --> 00:44:50,125
And now they are all starving.

573
00:44:52,291 --> 00:44:53,458
Tell me something.

574
00:44:55,916 --> 00:44:58,208
We'll be heading towards
capitalist economy at some point.

575
00:44:58,625 --> 00:45:00,833
Do you think this socialists'
slogan shouting trend will last?

576
00:45:00,916 --> 00:45:02,416
Stop chewing my brains, Varde.

577
00:45:05,041 --> 00:45:06,875
Why are you raising your voice?

578
00:45:08,166 --> 00:45:09,375
You want to show your attitude?

579
00:45:09,458 --> 00:45:11,458
Varde… enough, Jadhav.

580
00:45:11,541 --> 00:45:12,791
-Varde.
-He does this all the time.

581
00:45:13,416 --> 00:45:15,500
What “all the time”?
We're in a public place. Enough.

582
00:45:15,583 --> 00:45:17,791
What did I say to him?

583
00:45:18,041 --> 00:45:19,791
Don't be stupid.

584
00:45:20,125 --> 00:45:21,500
We barely meet.

585
00:45:21,583 --> 00:45:23,000
Stop this nonsense. Enough.

586
00:45:23,083 --> 00:45:24,583
He said my father will die.

587
00:45:24,666 --> 00:45:26,750
I meant the system. Listen first.

588
00:45:26,833 --> 00:45:28,458
Fine…

589
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:31,666
whatever was said and done.
End of conversation.

590
00:45:33,250 --> 00:45:36,291
-Over.
-Quiet. People are watching.

591
00:45:36,583 --> 00:45:38,333
-I didn't say anything.
-Now apologize.

592
00:45:38,416 --> 00:45:39,458
Why me?

593
00:45:39,541 --> 00:45:40,833
Do you have a problem?

594
00:45:45,041 --> 00:45:47,833
Come on, Varde. Apologize.

595
00:46:02,916 --> 00:46:03,750
Jadhav.

596
00:46:06,833 --> 00:46:07,666
Sorry.

597
00:46:09,708 --> 00:46:11,250
I don't want your apology.

598
00:46:11,333 --> 00:46:12,833
I just said sorry.

599
00:46:12,916 --> 00:46:14,166
You are right.

600
00:46:17,125 --> 00:46:19,625
About the union leaders, the system.

601
00:46:21,583 --> 00:46:22,458
But…

602
00:46:23,958 --> 00:46:25,250
I feel bad for my father.

603
00:46:29,083 --> 00:46:30,166
He is naive.

604
00:46:35,041 --> 00:46:36,333
This system...

605
00:46:37,125 --> 00:46:39,583
will scrounge every last drop from
these workers

606
00:46:39,958 --> 00:46:41,458
and chuck them on the side.

607
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,833
Like the system did to Singh sir.
Chucked him aside.

608
00:46:58,708 --> 00:47:01,083
Who served me this crab?

609
00:47:01,583 --> 00:47:02,416
Take it away.

610
00:47:04,125 --> 00:47:07,250
Don't ever order crab again.
Looks huge, but no meat.

611
00:47:08,125 --> 00:47:10,833
What is this? What?

612
00:47:20,208 --> 00:47:21,833
Yes, how much?

613
00:47:24,458 --> 00:47:25,333
Wait. Shukla.

614
00:47:25,958 --> 00:47:27,625
I already said I'll pay the bill.

615
00:47:29,291 --> 00:47:30,458
Please visit again.

616
00:47:30,666 --> 00:47:31,666
What was that?

617
00:47:49,625 --> 00:47:51,250
-Bye...
-Bye...

618
00:47:57,291 --> 00:47:58,333
-Varde?
-Yes.

619
00:47:58,625 --> 00:48:00,583
-The dinner was amazing.
-Right.

620
00:48:00,708 --> 00:48:02,583
No doubt. It was delicious.

621
00:48:06,291 --> 00:48:07,791
Hey, what's wrong with him?

622
00:48:12,333 --> 00:48:13,583
Ismail Pathan.

623
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:18,000
Surve, he handles Kalsekar's
money laundering business.

624
00:48:18,083 --> 00:48:19,750
But hadn't he escaped to Dubai?

625
00:48:22,458 --> 00:48:23,291
Yeah.

626
00:48:23,416 --> 00:48:27,166
If he dies, there will be no one to
launder the money to Kalsekar in Dubai.

627
00:49:10,833 --> 00:49:12,875
If we want to do something, then this is

628
00:49:12,958 --> 00:49:15,458
our only chance.
Before he flees back to Dubai.

629
00:49:17,625 --> 00:49:19,208
This is not our jurisdiction.

630
00:49:19,875 --> 00:49:23,000
Not ours, then let's call someone
who works in this jurisdiction.

631
00:49:54,916 --> 00:49:59,416
Every time I saw a film
Even I wanted to be a movie star

632
00:50:40,333 --> 00:50:41,250
Hold on.

633
00:50:42,166 --> 00:50:43,166
One last rehearsal.

634
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:44,750
Say nothing about Pathan.

635
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:46,666
Because any police officer
can be on his payroll.

636
00:50:46,750 --> 00:50:47,583
Right.

637
00:50:47,666 --> 00:50:50,291
All we say is that a murder suspect
from my jurisdiction…

638
00:50:50,375 --> 00:50:53,625
A murder suspect
from your jurisdiction is in this area.

639
00:50:53,708 --> 00:50:56,041
We need help, we need backup.
Send someone now.

640
00:50:56,125 --> 00:50:57,625
-Not a word about Pathan.
-No!

641
00:50:57,750 --> 00:50:58,666
That's it!

642
00:51:05,166 --> 00:51:06,875
Spare me some alms.

643
00:51:19,791 --> 00:51:20,791
Pramod Shukla.

644
00:51:21,958 --> 00:51:24,041
-You...
-Kohinoor Mill Lockout.

645
00:51:24,833 --> 00:51:28,125
-Where is the suspect?
-He is inside the shrine.

646
00:51:28,250 --> 00:51:30,166
My colleague is keeping an eye on him.

647
00:51:30,250 --> 00:51:31,583
Okay. Let’s go in then.

648
00:51:31,791 --> 00:51:35,208
No need, please relax. We'll handle
him as soon as we get the signal.

649
00:51:36,375 --> 00:51:37,375
Okay.

650
00:51:38,666 --> 00:51:43,166
Spare me some alms.

651
00:51:44,791 --> 00:51:47,250
My other slipper is missing.

652
00:51:48,833 --> 00:51:52,333
Who took boss's slipper? Who was it?

653
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:03,625
Spare me some alms for the love of God.

654
00:52:09,250 --> 00:52:10,541
Sub-inspector Surve.

655
00:52:14,750 --> 00:52:15,583
Rastogi.

656
00:52:16,833 --> 00:52:18,000
My hands are not clean.

657
00:52:18,291 --> 00:52:21,583
Shukla, go inside. He's
on the other side of the food stall.

658
00:52:27,416 --> 00:52:29,166
Go get a pair of slippers.

659
00:52:30,875 --> 00:52:32,375
Can I get you something, sir?

660
00:52:32,458 --> 00:52:33,958
Soup, minced meat or pilaf?

661
00:52:39,958 --> 00:52:43,208
Pathan, I'm a sub-inspector.

662
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:45,625
Did you really think

663
00:52:46,666 --> 00:52:50,291
you can sneak in and out
of Bombay overnight,

664
00:52:51,125 --> 00:52:52,708
and we won't even get a whiff?

665
00:52:54,916 --> 00:52:56,875
Which police station are you from, son?

666
00:52:57,458 --> 00:52:58,458
None of your business.

667
00:52:59,750 --> 00:53:02,041
I guess you didn't receive your share.

668
00:53:02,125 --> 00:53:03,041
Money?

669
00:53:05,250 --> 00:53:06,208
I don't want money.

670
00:53:09,833 --> 00:53:11,208
Perhaps not money,

671
00:53:11,416 --> 00:53:13,583
then what else do you want? You'll get it.

672
00:53:18,875 --> 00:53:20,208
Come with me without a word.

673
00:53:21,041 --> 00:53:24,125
So, you want to take me
to the police station?

674
00:53:24,208 --> 00:53:25,041
Yes.

675
00:53:25,833 --> 00:53:27,750
I'll take you there and book you.

676
00:53:29,416 --> 00:53:32,916
Now start moving
or I will drag you all the way.

677
00:53:34,625 --> 00:53:38,000
Bastard. No manners.

678
00:53:39,375 --> 00:53:42,750
No respect for elders. Get the car.

679
00:53:43,125 --> 00:53:46,458
We'll show this cop what an arrest
at Pathan's godown feels like.

680
00:53:46,583 --> 00:53:49,041
-Pathan!
-Hey!

681
00:53:56,083 --> 00:53:57,833
You shot him point-blank!

682
00:54:00,375 --> 00:54:02,791
-Why didn't you follow the procedure?
-We did, sir.

683
00:54:02,875 --> 00:54:06,750
Pathan was abducting
Inspector Varde. Forcibly.

684
00:54:06,833 --> 00:54:08,291
Why did Varde go after him?

685
00:54:08,375 --> 00:54:11,875
Sir, we spotted a murder suspect
from my area. Case file number 307.

686
00:54:12,250 --> 00:54:15,541
Mahim is not our jurisdiction. So,
we called Inspector Rastogi for backup.

687
00:54:16,291 --> 00:54:17,333
Yes, sir.

688
00:54:18,541 --> 00:54:20,833
But sir,
I had no clue that Pathan was there.

689
00:54:21,625 --> 00:54:23,750
We didn't know either. Rastogi sir?

690
00:54:23,833 --> 00:54:26,500
Sir, we were following the murder suspect.

691
00:54:26,583 --> 00:54:28,541
But we lost him in the crowd
and spotted Pathan instead.

692
00:54:28,625 --> 00:54:31,083
And once we spotted Pathan
what should we had done? Let him go?

693
00:54:31,166 --> 00:54:33,500
Especially when Rastogi
was there to help.

694
00:54:35,541 --> 00:54:37,458
Eye-witnesses have testified saying,

695
00:54:38,708 --> 00:54:41,416
Pathan didn't have any weapons.

696
00:54:41,750 --> 00:54:44,958
In fact, his men never drew any weapons.

697
00:54:46,291 --> 00:54:49,541
Sir, these local people’s loyalties lie
with Pathan.They'll never tell the truth.

698
00:54:49,625 --> 00:54:52,708
And I fired first two shots at his legs.
To warn him.

699
00:55:03,708 --> 00:55:05,666
Sir, Pathan had a gun.

700
00:55:05,791 --> 00:55:07,541
He held it against my waist.

701
00:55:08,625 --> 00:55:10,166
It's bruised. See for yourself.

702
00:55:10,791 --> 00:55:11,875
Come on, leave.

703
00:55:12,708 --> 00:55:14,583
Take a look first.
My skin is completely bruised.

704
00:55:14,666 --> 00:55:15,916
I know.

705
00:55:18,375 --> 00:55:19,708
Your skin's bruised.

706
00:55:20,666 --> 00:55:21,625
Now out.

707
00:55:22,458 --> 00:55:23,333
All of you.

708
00:55:24,375 --> 00:55:25,291
Sir!

709
00:55:29,208 --> 00:55:32,541
Sir… what do you have to say
about Pathan's killing?

710
00:55:32,791 --> 00:55:34,791
Sir, did the police know
that Pathan was in India?

711
00:55:34,875 --> 00:55:38,208
-We can't tell you.
-Sir, when did Pathan come to India?

712
00:55:38,291 --> 00:55:40,208
Sir, please…

713
00:55:44,833 --> 00:55:46,125
What are you doing?

714
00:55:46,958 --> 00:55:48,416
Your skin is actually bruised.

715
00:55:49,375 --> 00:55:52,125
Hey, Varde, did Pathan
actually stick a gun to your waist?

716
00:55:55,958 --> 00:55:59,750
We had made a mistake once. When we
didn't soil our tracksuits in the mud.

717
00:56:03,416 --> 00:56:04,416
But this time I did.

718
00:56:08,541 --> 00:56:09,958
Hail Singh sir.

719
00:56:10,541 --> 00:56:11,791
Let's go.

720
00:56:15,875 --> 00:56:18,875
The matchsticks struck by the dean
had lit their first fire.

721
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:23,750
But Pathan was sheer lottery.
We had got him by luck.

722
00:56:24,375 --> 00:56:27,041
But getting the other key members of
Kalsekar's gang

723
00:56:27,125 --> 00:56:28,416
wasn't going to be a cakewalk.

724
00:56:29,625 --> 00:56:31,625
Where guns don't work,

725
00:56:31,750 --> 00:56:33,708
one should work as termites,

726
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:35,291
Dean sir had once said.

727
00:56:37,125 --> 00:56:40,583
So, we started killing Kalsekar's
small-time crooks.

728
00:57:02,875 --> 00:57:03,708
So...

729
00:57:04,875 --> 00:57:08,375
Are you still in touch with
your first batch? Class of '83.

730
00:57:09,541 --> 00:57:12,791
I get a new batch every year.
They are all my students.

731
00:57:16,125 --> 00:57:17,208
No contact

732
00:57:17,583 --> 00:57:19,375
-with anyone whatsoever?
-No.

733
00:57:19,958 --> 00:57:20,833
Why?

734
00:57:22,875 --> 00:57:23,708
Nothing!

735
00:57:24,375 --> 00:57:28,208
Many of Kalsekar's men were shot dead
in the past couple of years.

736
00:57:29,250 --> 00:57:30,625
And behind each killing was…

737
00:57:32,291 --> 00:57:33,375
one of your students.

738
00:57:34,541 --> 00:57:37,916
We don't have any lesson named
“Kalsekar” in the syllabus here either.

739
00:57:39,333 --> 00:57:41,041
I just focus on the syllabus.

740
00:57:54,708 --> 00:57:57,250
But a blow to Kalsekar meant...

741
00:57:58,083 --> 00:57:59,791
a blow to Minister Patkar as well.

742
00:58:00,625 --> 00:58:02,333
Patkar had the press in his pocket.

743
00:58:04,208 --> 00:58:07,458
The press started screaming blood.
Accusing police of human rights violations

744
00:58:08,083 --> 00:58:09,291
and to put extra pressure

745
00:58:09,541 --> 00:58:12,625
DGP Raghav Desai
was summoned to the secretariat.

746
00:58:14,458 --> 00:58:17,166
There are serious matters
in the intelligence report.

747
00:58:17,791 --> 00:58:19,958
This could embarrass
the entire Police Force.

748
00:58:20,041 --> 00:58:22,416
These encounters…

749
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:24,833
I'm held accountable at the Parliament.

750
00:58:24,958 --> 00:58:27,583
And on the other hand that gangster Naik.

751
00:58:27,666 --> 00:58:30,166
Naik is trying to
encroach into Kalsekar's territory.

752
00:58:30,250 --> 00:58:32,333
This can lead to a gang war.

753
00:58:35,166 --> 00:58:36,166
Sir.

754
00:58:36,916 --> 00:58:38,541
I had a vague idea.

755
00:58:39,208 --> 00:58:41,416
Let's make a special squad.

756
00:58:42,291 --> 00:58:44,958
We'll recruit handpicked PSIs and PIs,

757
00:58:45,458 --> 00:58:49,375
and they will have the permission
to act even outside their jurisdiction.

758
00:58:50,625 --> 00:58:51,500
Punjab model.

759
00:58:51,583 --> 00:58:56,625
The evidence of these killings won't
reach any DCP, DGP, IG or ministers.

760
00:58:57,208 --> 00:58:59,708
None of us will sign any orders.

761
00:59:01,041 --> 00:59:03,166
You really earned your post, Raghav.

762
00:59:04,041 --> 00:59:06,291
Thank you, sir.
But there is one problem, sir.

763
00:59:07,166 --> 00:59:10,958
This squad cannot just kill
the members of Naik gang.

764
00:59:11,250 --> 00:59:13,458
We also have to target the Kalsekar gang

765
00:59:13,541 --> 00:59:15,916
Only then will it look legitimate.

766
00:59:19,208 --> 00:59:20,083
Okay.

767
00:59:25,250 --> 00:59:26,250
Jai Hind, sir.

768
00:59:27,166 --> 00:59:32,916
DGP Raghav cleverly presented
Dean sir's idea as his own.

769
00:59:33,083 --> 00:59:36,041
The press,
that were hurling accusations at us,

770
00:59:36,208 --> 00:59:37,333
now made us heroes.

771
00:59:38,791 --> 00:59:41,083
But Kalsekar's gang
was not some ordinary gang.

772
00:59:42,333 --> 00:59:43,958
We killed one of his,

773
00:59:44,041 --> 00:59:48,125
and Kalsekar would give charge
to someone more notorious of that area.

774
00:59:49,125 --> 00:59:50,083
It was a game.

775
00:59:50,916 --> 00:59:52,666
Kalsekar was the player

776
00:59:52,750 --> 00:59:54,125
and we were amateurs.

777
00:59:57,750 --> 01:00:00,541
One day, we received a tip

778
01:00:00,625 --> 01:00:03,166
that Chhota Naik
is coming to the dockyard.

779
01:00:03,333 --> 01:00:06,916
Quite possibly it was Kalsekar who had
tipped off the department about Naik.

780
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:07,875
Because Naik...

781
01:00:08,541 --> 01:00:10,541
could have become the next Kalsekar.

782
01:00:11,458 --> 01:00:14,291
Sir… Please let me go.

783
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:15,666
-I didn't kill anyone.
-Who is he?

784
01:00:15,750 --> 01:00:16,791
Chhota Naik.

785
01:00:21,041 --> 01:00:21,875
Let him go.

786
01:00:23,125 --> 01:00:24,500
He doesn't work for Kalsekar.

787
01:00:24,583 --> 01:00:27,750
As the saying goes, Naik and Kalsekar...

788
01:00:29,041 --> 01:00:30,208
are enemies.

789
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:38,458
Jadhav and I didn't report Shukla
and Varde letting Naik go.

790
01:00:39,166 --> 01:00:40,666
I got a hunch though.

791
01:00:41,833 --> 01:00:43,916
While cleaning up crime for Dean sir

792
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:47,291
Shukla and Varde were themselves going
to get sucked into some sewer of crime.

793
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:58,500
Please, sir. This way. Actually,
it's the 150th year of our newspaper.

794
01:00:58,958 --> 01:01:03,041
150th year. And we are giving
some special guests a tour of our press.

795
01:01:03,166 --> 01:01:05,958
-Am I special?
-You are special to us.

796
01:01:06,125 --> 01:01:08,583
Your photo will be published
on our "City" page.

797
01:01:08,666 --> 01:01:10,541
And the photographer is waiting for you.

798
01:01:10,916 --> 01:01:12,125
-That way?
-Yes.

799
01:01:12,250 --> 01:01:15,916
Actually, sir, we have come up with
a very interesting headline for you.

800
01:01:16,083 --> 01:01:18,666
Headline is, "Dirty Harries of Bombay".

801
01:01:20,625 --> 01:01:23,416
-Who is this Harry?
-Are they going to call you "dirty"?

802
01:01:23,875 --> 01:01:27,541
Actually, ma'am, dirty Harry
is a famous policeman of America.

803
01:01:27,666 --> 01:01:29,875
He may be. But my husband is not dirty.

804
01:01:30,541 --> 01:01:34,458
It takes an awful lot of detergent
and tinopal to keep his uniform clean.

805
01:01:34,958 --> 01:01:36,500
Don't print any nonsense.

806
01:01:36,583 --> 01:01:39,125
-Understood?
-Yes, sir. Sir, please come this way.

807
01:01:40,041 --> 01:01:42,666
This is a sample layout of your piece.

808
01:01:43,291 --> 01:01:44,583
Take a look, sir. This one.

809
01:01:51,500 --> 01:01:53,875
My photo and name will come here.

810
01:01:57,458 --> 01:01:59,208
Do you have your gun?

811
01:01:59,291 --> 01:02:01,375
Just for the pose. For the pose.

812
01:02:08,458 --> 01:02:09,416
What is this?

813
01:02:12,166 --> 01:02:13,625
Sixty-five?

814
01:02:15,541 --> 01:02:18,875
You did 65 encounters
in the last three years.

815
01:02:19,958 --> 01:02:21,291
Am… Am I right?

816
01:02:22,333 --> 01:02:23,625
I said 72.

817
01:02:26,416 --> 01:02:29,125
Sir, you said "round about 72."

818
01:02:29,875 --> 01:02:34,208
That's why when I was interviewing
Varde sir, I cross-checked with him.

819
01:02:35,875 --> 01:02:40,250
And he said he did 55 and you did 62.

820
01:02:42,291 --> 01:02:44,208
The Dombivali shootout

821
01:02:44,291 --> 01:02:46,333
was actually Varde sir's.

822
01:02:46,833 --> 01:02:48,500
I mean he only told me that.

823
01:02:52,041 --> 01:02:53,500
Doesn't matter, sir. I…

824
01:02:54,291 --> 01:02:56,333
I put in a round figure instead. 65.

825
01:02:56,416 --> 01:02:58,333
-See.
-Varde said that?

826
01:02:59,708 --> 01:03:02,375
-Yes, sir.
-Varde said that.

827
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:04,208
He just told you.

828
01:03:06,083 --> 01:03:08,333
You don't believe when your wife says it.

829
01:03:14,541 --> 01:03:15,416
Sir…

830
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:16,750
Shall we, sir?

831
01:03:19,583 --> 01:03:20,791
Sir?

832
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:22,125
-Yes?
-Shall we?

833
01:03:22,750 --> 01:03:24,208
Photographer is waiting.

834
01:03:25,333 --> 01:03:26,666
Listen. Do one  thing.

835
01:03:27,916 --> 01:03:31,458
Print this article without me.

836
01:03:34,958 --> 01:03:37,375
-Without your photo?
-No photo, no name,

837
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:39,583
don't mention a word about me.

838
01:03:40,083 --> 01:03:41,958
Write about the rest.

839
01:03:42,583 --> 01:03:44,250
How is that possible, sir?

840
01:03:44,916 --> 01:03:48,166
Everything is ready. The negative,
the rough proof, its all ready... Sir...

841
01:03:48,250 --> 01:03:50,750
Are you going to teach me about proof now?

842
01:03:50,833 --> 01:03:52,791
What are you doing, sir? No, sir.

843
01:03:52,875 --> 01:03:56,208
-Are you going to teach a policeman now?
-No.

844
01:04:16,791 --> 01:04:17,666
Let's go!

845
01:04:23,666 --> 01:04:26,916
The numbers game caused a rift
between Shukla and Varde.

846
01:04:27,791 --> 01:04:31,791
Kalsekar took advantage of their rift
and approached Shukla with an offer.

847
01:04:31,875 --> 01:04:35,416
And Naik gang poached Varde to their side.

848
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:36,875
Welcome. Welcome… happy Eid.

849
01:04:37,041 --> 01:04:38,458
Sister-in-law, this is Sakina.

850
01:04:38,583 --> 01:04:40,166
-Congratulations for the engagement.
-Thank you.

851
01:04:40,250 --> 01:04:42,791
When money talks,
a lot of mouths get shut.

852
01:04:43,916 --> 01:04:46,416
Jadhav and Surve too
dipped their hands in the river of money.

853
01:04:47,125 --> 01:04:51,750
And no one in the department
had the guts to put a stop to its flow.

854
01:04:51,875 --> 01:04:53,208
Food is delicious.

855
01:04:53,958 --> 01:04:58,291
Come here, little Shukla,
looking handsome.

856
01:04:58,375 --> 01:05:00,041
Little Shukla is dressed
in traditional attire.

857
01:05:00,125 --> 01:05:01,875
Wonderful!

858
01:05:02,416 --> 01:05:04,125
You are looking good in this outfit.

859
01:05:05,125 --> 01:05:07,291
Son, here you go. Your gift.

860
01:05:08,750 --> 01:05:09,666
Don't, Varde.

861
01:05:11,750 --> 01:05:12,958
You will spoil him.

862
01:05:13,708 --> 01:05:15,375
What do you mean I'll spoil him?

863
01:05:18,125 --> 01:05:20,916
This is not Kalsekar's money
that he will get spoiled.

864
01:05:27,166 --> 01:05:28,208
What do you mean?

865
01:05:31,125 --> 01:05:32,083
We're friends.

866
01:05:34,125 --> 01:05:35,458
We're family.

867
01:05:36,333 --> 01:05:37,583
Nothing is hidden from us.

868
01:05:41,083 --> 01:05:43,250
-Nothing is hidden?
-No.

869
01:05:44,333 --> 01:05:47,500
And what about you who takes
credit for my encounters?

870
01:05:47,583 --> 01:05:48,583
Behind my back.

871
01:05:49,416 --> 01:05:51,833
Without me, you would be behind the bars.

872
01:05:51,916 --> 01:05:53,500
"Credit..."

873
01:05:55,708 --> 01:05:57,333
You're out in the open because of me.

874
01:05:58,958 --> 01:06:00,875
Legal planning, angle,

875
01:06:01,458 --> 01:06:03,125
-that's all me.
-Varde.

876
01:06:03,791 --> 01:06:05,833
Shukla.

877
01:06:06,833 --> 01:06:08,291
Shut your mouth and eat.

878
01:06:12,750 --> 01:06:15,041
This is my home.
I don't want a scene here.

879
01:06:17,375 --> 01:06:18,541
There are ladies inside.

880
01:06:22,875 --> 01:06:23,958
One should think

881
01:06:24,208 --> 01:06:26,083
-before acting.
-Correct.

882
01:06:26,250 --> 01:06:27,916
Kalsekar pays him

883
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,833
and off he goes killing his enemies.

884
01:06:30,916 --> 01:06:34,458
-No brains, just bang... bang... bang.
-Shukla.

885
01:06:38,708 --> 01:06:40,208
Why don’t you tell him to stop it Aslam?

886
01:06:40,291 --> 01:06:41,333
What is he going to tell me?

887
01:06:42,375 --> 01:06:44,333
What? He knows I am telling the truth.

888
01:06:44,416 --> 01:06:46,541
Stop it, Varde. Stop it.

889
01:06:46,625 --> 01:06:48,416
-You're a liar!
-Liar?

890
01:06:48,583 --> 01:06:51,333
-Naik paid you, didn't he?
-How did Naik get in all this?

891
01:06:51,416 --> 01:06:55,500
He wants to take credit. My credit.
Bloody lying bastard!

892
01:06:55,583 --> 01:06:57,708
-Pramod, what's going on?
-Go!

893
01:06:58,708 --> 01:07:02,208
-Sister-in-law, please--
-Nothing, Sister-in-law.

894
01:07:02,291 --> 01:07:05,833
You see, he's a compulsive shagger.
He can only bark but won't bite.

895
01:07:05,916 --> 01:07:07,791
Varde, you asshole... you bloody...

896
01:07:07,875 --> 01:07:09,708
-One minute.
-How dare you?

897
01:07:09,791 --> 01:07:10,958
Bastard!

898
01:07:11,041 --> 01:07:12,708
Stop it. Listen to me. You will die.

899
01:07:12,791 --> 01:07:15,416
Bloody pimp. How dare you!

900
01:07:15,500 --> 01:07:17,375
Stop it... listen to me.

901
01:07:17,458 --> 01:07:19,333
You can't even handle a gun!

902
01:07:32,791 --> 01:07:34,875
I have no right to suggest.

903
01:07:36,958 --> 01:07:37,791
Just…

904
01:07:39,541 --> 01:07:40,666
consider this a request.

905
01:07:43,375 --> 01:07:45,041
Name her Sudha, if you don’t mind.

906
01:07:49,791 --> 01:07:50,666
Yes, father.

907
01:07:51,541 --> 01:07:53,333
The boss of the house is back.

908
01:08:13,708 --> 01:08:14,750
Hey!

909
01:08:16,166 --> 01:08:17,791
You're late, Mr. Local Guardian.

910
01:08:18,708 --> 01:08:20,000
I am here to see you.

911
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:22,375
What happened?

912
01:08:23,833 --> 01:08:26,833
Three innocent businessmen
died in a police firing.

913
01:08:28,083 --> 01:08:31,791
Shukla, Varde, and other members
of the squad are also involved.

914
01:08:32,583 --> 01:08:35,666
They claim that they mixed up
and confused the car model for another.

915
01:08:37,125 --> 01:08:38,541
Did you suspend them?

916
01:08:39,166 --> 01:08:40,833
It's not about the suspension.

917
01:08:41,666 --> 01:08:43,500
It's about bringing them to justice.

918
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:47,000
And as usual,
they've covered their tracks pretty well.

919
01:08:47,583 --> 01:08:51,250
That's why the department is finding it
very difficult to nail them in an inquiry.

920
01:08:52,958 --> 01:08:54,208
You trained them.

921
01:08:55,416 --> 01:08:57,291
No one knows them better than you.

922
01:08:58,500 --> 01:08:59,958
Chief Minister wants you back on the job.

923
01:09:01,291 --> 01:09:02,333
You've to resume your duty.

924
01:09:05,041 --> 01:09:07,666
A long ago
I left from a hospital to do my duty.

925
01:09:10,583 --> 01:09:12,375
It changed my entire life.

926
01:09:12,625 --> 01:09:13,541
I know.

927
01:09:15,333 --> 01:09:16,750
It might change again…

928
01:09:17,666 --> 01:09:19,000
hopefully for the better this time.

929
01:09:22,125 --> 01:09:24,500
Your granddaughter has brought you luck.

930
01:09:31,458 --> 01:09:33,000
This squad was your idea.

931
01:09:35,416 --> 01:09:36,333
Now rein it in.

932
01:09:43,166 --> 01:09:46,375
It is said that when the river Ganga came
down from the skies to drown the earth...

933
01:09:46,458 --> 01:09:50,208
the heavens summoned Lord Shiva
to rein it in, to stop its destruction.

934
01:09:50,916 --> 01:09:55,041
Dean's entry in our life
was just that sort... a hero's entry.

935
01:10:16,250 --> 01:10:19,250
This is Air India Radio,
and now news from Bombay.

936
01:10:20,125 --> 01:10:23,083
The case of three businessmen
who died in police firing

937
01:10:23,166 --> 01:10:25,666
is still a hot topic in the parliament.

938
01:10:26,083 --> 01:10:29,208
Human Rights Commission and the opposition
are demanding Inspectors

939
01:10:29,291 --> 01:10:35,416
Pramod Shukla, Vishnu Varde,
Janardhan Surve, and Laxman Jadhav,

940
01:10:35,500 --> 01:10:36,958
to be taken in judicial custody.

941
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:41,625
Chief Minister Mr. Manohar Patkar
and police department have

942
01:10:41,708 --> 01:10:44,666
assured a change in the
inquiry commission.

943
01:10:49,958 --> 01:10:53,708
You faces indicate that you were involved
in some kind of incident together.

944
01:10:53,791 --> 01:10:55,833
We were just doing our duty, sir.

945
01:10:56,291 --> 01:10:59,500
I received a tip-off about a blue Sedan
arriving near Bhaucha Pier

946
01:10:59,625 --> 01:11:02,083
The passengers in the car
were supposed to be carrying AK-47 rifles.

947
01:11:02,208 --> 01:11:04,250
Didn’t your informer
tell you the vehicle number?

948
01:11:04,333 --> 01:11:06,375
He did, sir.
But it was only partially correct.

949
01:11:06,458 --> 01:11:08,583
Even my informant gave me the same tip.

950
01:11:08,666 --> 01:11:10,791
Why didn't you two cross-check
the number with each other?

951
01:11:10,875 --> 01:11:13,041
I had no clue that Shukla
is going after them too, sir.

952
01:11:13,125 --> 01:11:14,916
Do you think it’s a game of race?

953
01:11:19,791 --> 01:11:22,833
We had information on dangerous criminals
being in that car, sir.

954
01:11:23,666 --> 01:11:25,583
Since the collapse of insurgency in Punjab,

955
01:11:25,666 --> 01:11:29,333
a lot of their AK-56 and AK-47 rifles
are finding their way to black market...

956
01:11:29,958 --> 01:11:31,416
right here in Bombay.

957
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:35,625
Is this the excuse that you have prepared
for the families dead businessmen?

958
01:11:36,083 --> 01:11:37,541
It was their bad luck, sir.

959
01:11:39,375 --> 01:11:44,166
The committee has also mentioned that
you were on the gangster's payroll.

960
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:48,666
The department has nicknamed you as

961
01:11:50,041 --> 01:11:51,291
"The 100-Crore club."

962
01:11:51,375 --> 01:11:53,041
The department is jealous of us.

963
01:11:54,041 --> 01:11:55,291
They are lying.

964
01:11:55,375 --> 01:11:57,958
Which gangster offered the money first?

965
01:11:58,041 --> 01:12:00,416
They all do, sir. From time-to-time.

966
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:02,375
Kalsekar did, sir.

967
01:12:08,958 --> 01:12:10,916
Kalsekar made the first offer...

968
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:11,916
to Shukla.

969
01:12:15,500 --> 01:12:16,333
Go on.

970
01:12:17,125 --> 01:12:18,875
For the record, sir…

971
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:21,541
Let me clear that for you.

972
01:12:25,333 --> 01:12:27,250
I didn't take money from anyone, sir.

973
01:12:27,916 --> 01:12:30,375
And if a policeman gets
paid to kill a gangster,

974
01:12:30,458 --> 01:12:32,791
then I don't see anything wrong in it.
Right, sir?

975
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:34,708
Absolutely right, sir.

976
01:12:35,333 --> 01:12:39,333
Gangsters offer us money
to kill members of their rival gangs.

977
01:12:39,416 --> 01:12:42,375
And that money can help us...

978
01:12:43,291 --> 01:12:46,250
if the department transfers us
to a punishment posting.

979
01:12:47,208 --> 01:12:49,291
We know what they did to you.

980
01:12:50,416 --> 01:12:51,458
And it happened,

981
01:12:52,208 --> 01:12:54,375
because you didn't know
how to play the game.

982
01:12:55,958 --> 01:12:58,708
It's an offense to hit any policeman.

983
01:13:01,041 --> 01:13:02,208
Hit, sir?

984
01:13:05,875 --> 01:13:07,000
We didn't hit any policeman, sir.

985
01:13:07,833 --> 01:13:09,458
None of us did, sir.

986
01:13:09,541 --> 01:13:10,750
No sir.

987
01:13:11,750 --> 01:13:13,375
I haven’t either. Yet.

988
01:13:14,458 --> 01:13:16,375
But today, my hands are itching.

989
01:13:28,166 --> 01:13:31,500
And since you commented that I don't know
how to play games, then let me tell you.

990
01:13:33,083 --> 01:13:36,125
What can one do if he's
better than his colleagues,

991
01:13:36,791 --> 01:13:38,250
if he's better than the system?

992
01:13:38,958 --> 01:13:40,875
Should one then choke his talent to death?

993
01:13:41,833 --> 01:13:45,083
And become mediocre like the members
of some 50-crore or 100-crore club?

994
01:13:46,791 --> 01:13:49,250
I have asked myself this question
again and again over the years.

995
01:13:49,916 --> 01:13:51,750
I have cursed myself for my abilities.

996
01:13:53,791 --> 01:13:56,541
And if anyone could help me get rid
of my abilities, like some disease...

997
01:13:56,625 --> 01:13:58,250
then I would have grabbed his help.

998
01:14:01,666 --> 01:14:02,791
So, its good

999
01:14:03,666 --> 01:14:05,500
that whatever you learned from me,

1000
01:14:06,375 --> 01:14:09,125
at least you didn't pick
my lack of ability to play the game.

1001
01:14:10,208 --> 01:14:11,958
If we had,

1002
01:14:12,083 --> 01:14:13,291
we would be long dead.

1003
01:14:13,958 --> 01:14:16,333
Then even our blood
would have been on your hands.

1004
01:14:16,416 --> 01:14:19,541
And you already have
a lot  of blood on your hands.

1005
01:14:27,416 --> 01:14:29,458
Sir, what action is being taken
against you?

1006
01:14:29,541 --> 01:14:31,416
When is Inquiry Committee
going to hold a press conference?

1007
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:33,166
Yes, sir. When will it happen? Sir.

1008
01:14:36,708 --> 01:14:39,291
We must resume the work we had started...

1009
01:14:40,250 --> 01:14:41,583
against Kalsekar gang.

1010
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,666
At the moment I can only trust you, Aslam.

1011
01:14:47,083 --> 01:14:51,000
You must head this operation.
This involves a lot of risk.

1012
01:14:52,333 --> 01:14:54,041
What I'm going to show you...

1013
01:14:55,166 --> 01:14:57,166
has to be kept confidential.

1014
01:14:59,833 --> 01:15:00,750
Aslam,

1015
01:15:00,833 --> 01:15:02,833
can you form a team of clean policemen?

1016
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:03,833
I am sorry to say, sir,

1017
01:15:03,916 --> 01:15:07,000
but clean policemen usually
don't have a strong informant network.

1018
01:15:07,083 --> 01:15:10,291
I used to have a very reliable
informer network of trusted postmen.

1019
01:15:14,083 --> 01:15:17,333
All the corruption charges
against me are baseless.

1020
01:15:17,416 --> 01:15:20,416
My home was searched,
my in-laws' home was raided.

1021
01:15:21,041 --> 01:15:23,208
But no unaccounted cash
turned up anywhere.

1022
01:15:28,625 --> 01:15:31,666
International calls and STD calls
are expensive.

1023
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:35,875
They are not viable
for the lower members of any gang.

1024
01:15:35,958 --> 01:15:38,916
But they send letters, use
money-order service to send money home.

1025
01:15:39,875 --> 01:15:42,083
And telegrams in case of an emergency.

1026
01:15:42,208 --> 01:15:45,708
Post department has information about
every trunk call, letter, and telegram.

1027
01:15:46,333 --> 01:15:50,625
And postmen know every street,
every lane in the city.

1028
01:15:51,958 --> 01:15:56,333
They walk the streets of this city
all day. And no one ever suspects them.

1029
01:15:58,750 --> 01:16:01,375
I killed only history-sheeters.

1030
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:04,708
They had criminal records.

1031
01:16:04,791 --> 01:16:08,500
In a few cases,
you killed footpath dwellers,

1032
01:16:08,583 --> 01:16:11,791
and mutilated their faces
to set off some existing case files.

1033
01:16:13,083 --> 01:16:16,000
-That's the allegation against you.
-Allegation?

1034
01:16:17,750 --> 01:16:18,958
Do you have any evidence?

1035
01:16:28,958 --> 01:16:30,291
Did you get married?

1036
01:16:33,416 --> 01:16:36,541
I've a fiancé.
Wedding is just around the corner.

1037
01:16:36,666 --> 01:16:38,041
Congratulations.

1038
01:16:39,166 --> 01:16:40,375
Thank you.

1039
01:16:40,875 --> 01:16:44,208
With the help of Dean sir's
secret informer network,

1040
01:16:44,291 --> 01:16:47,416
we found evidence against
Kalsekar gang's key members.

1041
01:16:47,500 --> 01:16:49,333
Some of  them
agreed to depose as eyewitnesses.

1042
01:16:49,416 --> 01:16:51,750
We made arrests. We made cases.

1043
01:16:51,833 --> 01:16:55,208
ASLAM KHAN GETTING FAME
FOR DEMOLISHING KALSEKAR'S GANG

1044
01:16:57,291 --> 01:16:58,708
When will it be ready?

1045
01:16:59,083 --> 01:17:00,500
It's the wedding season, aunty.

1046
01:17:01,250 --> 01:17:02,541
And your job order came in late.

1047
01:17:03,125 --> 01:17:04,916
My son is married to his duty.

1048
01:17:05,666 --> 01:17:07,166
He couldn’t take time out.

1049
01:17:07,291 --> 01:17:08,666
Girl, would you want to marry
a boy like this?

1050
01:17:10,416 --> 01:17:14,333
My father has two wives.
They both get along pretty well.

1051
01:17:15,583 --> 01:17:16,958
I will adjust with his job.

1052
01:17:29,333 --> 01:17:33,083
-The sherwani suits you.
-Thank you!

1053
01:17:35,791 --> 01:17:37,708
Are you always this quiet?

1054
01:17:38,250 --> 01:17:40,083
Speaking too much is bad for health.

1055
01:17:41,166 --> 01:17:44,958
-Hey! Those goons…
-Hey!

1056
01:17:46,541 --> 01:17:47,500
Aslam!

1057
01:18:32,166 --> 01:18:33,375
Hey, kids.

1058
01:18:36,375 --> 01:18:38,750
You think you can snatch chains
in broad daylight.

1059
01:18:41,791 --> 01:18:43,375
Do you think you own the city?

1060
01:18:44,625 --> 01:18:45,500
Give it back.

1061
01:18:56,875 --> 01:18:58,500
Narayan Shetty!

1062
01:19:01,041 --> 01:19:03,708
I've stolen your chain...

1063
01:19:07,458 --> 01:19:11,750
Let's sneak behind the church

1064
01:19:15,208 --> 01:19:19,333
You little rat. Which gutter were you
hiding in with your boss Kalsekar?

1065
01:19:19,958 --> 01:19:21,333
You bloody...

1066
01:19:33,958 --> 01:19:37,583
When rats come out of gutters,
plague spreads.

1067
01:19:38,208 --> 01:19:39,541
A lot of people die.

1068
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:42,250
A lot of people.

1069
01:20:26,708 --> 01:20:28,833
-You think you can kill a policeman?
-Yes!

1070
01:20:29,458 --> 01:20:32,625
-You think Bombay Police will sit quiet?
-Yes!

1071
01:20:32,708 --> 01:20:36,166
We're going to kill you
and your boss in your homes.

1072
01:20:43,833 --> 01:20:46,708
Squad. Slope arms.

1073
01:20:49,541 --> 01:20:50,666
Present arms.

1074
01:20:52,250 --> 01:20:53,083
Fire!

1075
01:20:54,500 --> 01:20:55,333
Fire!

1076
01:20:56,916 --> 01:20:57,750
Fire!

1077
01:21:42,458 --> 01:21:44,541
Looking for an easy death, sir?

1078
01:21:55,541 --> 01:21:59,000
I hope you didn’t put soil
on his grave with your dirty hands.

1079
01:22:00,791 --> 01:22:03,750
Just get us to Kalsekar and Shetty.

1080
01:22:04,666 --> 01:22:06,166
Then we'll kill you

1081
01:22:06,791 --> 01:22:09,208
in any which way you like.

1082
01:22:09,958 --> 01:22:11,166
We’ll even give our lives for you.

1083
01:22:13,208 --> 01:22:16,916
We'll give whatever statement you
want us to give to the Inquiry Committee.

1084
01:22:18,375 --> 01:22:19,416
But please…

1085
01:22:21,541 --> 01:22:23,541
we have to do this for Aslam.

1086
01:22:27,750 --> 01:22:29,125
You want me to believe in you two again?

1087
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,250
Give you two another chance!

1088
01:22:34,250 --> 01:22:36,708
Not to us, sir, give yourself...

1089
01:22:37,875 --> 01:22:38,791
another chance.

1090
01:22:41,291 --> 01:22:43,708
Your shattered test tubes
can’t blow off anymore sir.

1091
01:23:17,291 --> 01:23:18,375
I had a wish…

1092
01:23:19,416 --> 01:23:21,375
to be an officer like Dean sir .

1093
01:23:21,708 --> 01:23:22,916
To have his qualities.

1094
01:23:23,583 --> 01:23:25,500
That wish died with me.

1095
01:23:26,416 --> 01:23:30,791
But if my death can make Dean sir
and these fools trust each other again…

1096
01:23:31,125 --> 01:23:33,000
then my death would be worth it.

1097
01:23:54,958 --> 01:23:59,166
Who could have imagined the Cotton Mills
would just vanish from the face of Bombay.

1098
01:23:59,916 --> 01:24:01,791
Cotton, the King of Bombay.

1099
01:24:04,416 --> 01:24:06,666
The Jumania Builders are
developing this land.

1100
01:24:07,541 --> 01:24:09,750
But the real owner is my son-in-law.

1101
01:24:10,375 --> 01:24:12,625
I am setting him up
in the real-estate business.

1102
01:24:12,708 --> 01:24:13,916
Anything else?

1103
01:24:16,125 --> 01:24:17,291
Umar Kalsekar.

1104
01:24:19,541 --> 01:24:21,916
You crippled his business.

1105
01:24:22,791 --> 01:24:24,000
You killed his people.

1106
01:24:24,875 --> 01:24:27,250
Only that Shetty is left in his gang.

1107
01:24:28,291 --> 01:24:29,833
Now stop this all.

1108
01:24:32,458 --> 01:24:35,250
Are you setting up Kalsekar
in real estate too?

1109
01:24:35,333 --> 01:24:37,875
Kalsekar doesn't need me for that.

1110
01:24:38,541 --> 01:24:40,291
He's bought a piece of mill land too.

1111
01:24:40,375 --> 01:24:43,416
Not this one... it’s some other mill,
using some builder as a front.

1112
01:24:44,250 --> 01:24:46,541
Give Kalsekar some time.

1113
01:24:47,666 --> 01:24:48,916
Soon he’ll go white-collar--

1114
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:50,958
He’s not even worthy of a dog collar!

1115
01:24:53,458 --> 01:24:56,125
Tell Kalsekar to come to India
and surrender.

1116
01:24:56,708 --> 01:24:59,791
-Then he’ll probably live.
-Are you so naive?

1117
01:25:01,041 --> 01:25:04,208
Any gangster can operate
from inside the jail.

1118
01:25:04,958 --> 01:25:09,083
Eight years ago I helped Kalsekar by
transferring you to a punishment posting.

1119
01:25:10,500 --> 01:25:13,583
This time I am trying to help you,
and you're walking out on me.

1120
01:25:14,291 --> 01:25:16,750
You can transfer me
to a punishment posting again.

1121
01:25:20,416 --> 01:25:22,666
You both are alike.

1122
01:25:23,250 --> 01:25:24,500
You and Kalsekar.

1123
01:25:25,750 --> 01:25:27,958
I sent you to a punishment posting,

1124
01:25:28,125 --> 01:25:29,500
sent you away from Bombay.

1125
01:25:30,500 --> 01:25:33,125
But let me tell you,
I realized one thing.

1126
01:25:34,708 --> 01:25:36,333
I have authority over you.

1127
01:25:37,208 --> 01:25:38,541
My rank is superior,

1128
01:25:39,375 --> 01:25:41,291
But I have no power over you.

1129
01:25:42,333 --> 01:25:45,041
Neither over you, nor over Kalsekar.

1130
01:25:45,125 --> 01:25:48,500
Any minister in my position
would have done the same thing.

1131
01:25:49,125 --> 01:25:50,250
You, me…

1132
01:25:51,333 --> 01:25:52,666
We are all disposable.

1133
01:26:20,833 --> 01:26:22,666
Najma is Kalsekar's sister.
She doesn’t have a child of her own.

1134
01:26:22,750 --> 01:26:24,583
Kalsekar's given his daughter
in adoption to Najma.

1135
01:26:47,791 --> 01:26:50,291
-Two chocolates? Okay!
-Yes!

1136
01:27:07,583 --> 01:27:09,041
-No…
-No…

1137
01:27:11,083 --> 01:27:12,666
-Let's go.
-No!

1138
01:27:14,833 --> 01:27:16,375
-Let's go.
-No!

1139
01:27:16,500 --> 01:27:17,875
Come on. Hurry up!

1140
01:27:26,291 --> 01:27:31,583
Tell Kalsekar that he must come and meet
us if he wishes to see his daughter alive.

1141
01:27:31,666 --> 01:27:33,750
That's all. Nothing else is written on it?

1142
01:27:33,833 --> 01:27:34,791
No, brother.

1143
01:27:35,583 --> 01:27:37,416
Nothing else. That's it.

1144
01:27:38,458 --> 01:27:40,666
There is this
imported cigarette bud though.

1145
01:27:40,916 --> 01:27:42,250
Seems pretty old.

1146
01:27:42,416 --> 01:27:43,625
It's eight years old.

1147
01:27:45,166 --> 01:27:46,666
I know where she is.

1148
01:27:53,666 --> 01:27:56,708
Varde. Leave something for
Dean sir as well.

1149
01:27:57,833 --> 01:27:58,875
For me...

1150
01:28:01,125 --> 01:28:02,250
this will do.

1151
01:28:02,333 --> 01:28:04,083
As you wish, sir.

1152
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,916
I am not even sure if Kalsekar will
show up based on such a cryptic letter.

1153
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:17,958
Let's go.

1154
01:28:41,833 --> 01:28:42,875
Hello.

1155
01:28:43,833 --> 01:28:44,750
Jai Hind, sir!

1156
01:28:45,208 --> 01:28:47,083
-Singh here.
-Jai Hind. What is it?

1157
01:28:47,166 --> 01:28:48,958
I just wanted to say that

1158
01:28:49,500 --> 01:28:52,416
I'll always be grateful to you
for your good deeds.

1159
01:28:52,500 --> 01:28:54,916
-Singh, are you all right?
-Working under you,

1160
01:28:55,041 --> 01:28:56,333
I learned a lot.

1161
01:28:57,333 --> 01:29:00,875
The work that you did
for this country and state…

1162
01:29:00,958 --> 01:29:01,875
What on earth are you saying?

1163
01:29:01,958 --> 01:29:05,833
Even I would like to do some good work,
so the department gets a sound reputation.

1164
01:29:06,500 --> 01:29:07,750
Have you lost your mind?

1165
01:29:08,166 --> 01:29:09,583
Get yourself treated.

1166
01:29:09,791 --> 01:29:11,000
Every police...

1167
01:29:13,291 --> 01:29:14,791
That Singh... He's lost his mind.

1168
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:52,333
Here I am.

1169
01:29:53,125 --> 01:29:54,750
Isn't this what you wanted?

1170
01:29:57,416 --> 01:30:00,958
When it comes to your family
one can’t stay in hiding for long.

1171
01:30:03,583 --> 01:30:05,416
Isn't that right, Kalsekar?

1172
01:30:05,500 --> 01:30:07,125
Is this coming from you

1173
01:30:08,416 --> 01:30:11,291
who ignored his family
and kept chasing me?

1174
01:30:11,833 --> 01:30:12,958
All these years…

1175
01:30:19,041 --> 01:30:21,000
This war was between you and me.

1176
01:30:21,875 --> 01:30:24,208
Why did you involve women
and children in it?

1177
01:30:40,416 --> 01:30:41,583
Where...

1178
01:30:43,291 --> 01:30:44,666
is my daughter?

1179
01:30:45,333 --> 01:30:46,958
I choked her to death.

1180
01:30:49,666 --> 01:30:51,166
And threw her in the sea.

1181
01:31:48,166 --> 01:31:50,583
Don't expect me
to go soft on you in the inquiry.

1182
01:32:02,166 --> 01:32:03,458
Naik, be ready.

1183
01:32:07,166 --> 01:32:08,250
Let's go.

1184
01:32:17,875 --> 01:32:19,958
If this is your doing…

1185
01:32:21,458 --> 01:32:23,458
then God help you, Singh.

1186
01:32:24,083 --> 01:32:25,041
Me, sir?

1187
01:32:30,291 --> 01:32:32,041
At that moment I was at the GPO, sir.

1188
01:32:33,500 --> 01:32:35,458
Talking to you over the phone.

1189
01:32:49,583 --> 01:32:52,166
Police system is a coin with two sides.

1190
01:32:53,125 --> 01:32:55,583
On one side is the law and
on the other is order.

1191
01:32:56,583 --> 01:33:00,250
And sometimes, to maintain order,
one has to break the law.

1192
01:33:00,458 --> 01:33:02,916
When order is maintained
the system functions properly.
