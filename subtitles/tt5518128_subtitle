1
00:01:47,173 --> 00:01:48,174
Can..can you hear me?

2
00:01:49,075 --> 00:01:50,019
Hello check.

3
00:01:51,678 --> 00:01:52,850
Can you hear me?

4
00:01:53,546 --> 00:01:56,891
Hello. Can you hear me?

5
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,256
Is everyone listening?

6
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:04,000
Okay, let me tell you
a story about these guys.

7
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:09,664
In big cities,
they live in penthouses.

8
00:02:10,063 --> 00:02:11,542
They have farmhouses.

9
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:14,076
Fast cars, fast lives.

10
00:02:14,567 --> 00:02:17,104
Open relationships, and secret wives.

11
00:02:17,737 --> 00:02:22,083
But behind all these lives,
roses are red, violets are blue.

12
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:24,486
Sex can be messy,
but love can be true.

13
00:02:26,713 --> 00:02:28,021
Is everyone listening?

14
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:40,193
"Roses are red, violets are blue."

15
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,831
"Sex can be messy,
but love can be true."

16
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:54,908
Mr. Raichand.
Oh, God!

17
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:03,960
What were you doing?
Where were you?

18
00:03:06,553 --> 00:03:07,657
Sir, sir.. - Sir.

19
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:14,861
Who is he? - Om Raichand

20
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,830
He lived in the penthouse upstairs.

21
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:18,634
The top floor.

22
00:03:19,098 --> 00:03:19,974
That's where he fell from.

23
00:03:20,066 --> 00:03:21,204
Did he fall or was he thrown?

24
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:23,040
Seems like he fell, sir.

25
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:24,271
But we cannot rule out suicide either.

26
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:25,843
He's a very rich man.

27
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:27,846
The guard said it happened at 3am.

28
00:03:28,107 --> 00:03:29,142
He has no kids.

29
00:03:29,576 --> 00:03:31,146
She has a wife, but. ..she
wasn't at home when this happened.

30
00:03:31,277 --> 00:03:32,187
Is she here now?

31
00:03:32,245 --> 00:03:33,155
She is.

32
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:35,658
You will receive all
the papers by 3 o'clock.

33
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:36,860
Okay, bye.

34
00:03:37,917 --> 00:03:38,657
Yes.

35
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:40,254
I am senior inspector Ramakant Kamath.

36
00:03:40,653 --> 00:03:42,291
This is Gupte. - Yes.

37
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:45,028
What do we say? We're here to listen.

38
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:46,702
"Whatever your madam says.

39
00:03:47,026 --> 00:03:48,596
Because we need her statement.

40
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:57,379
You can understand that
madam's very upset right now.

41
00:03:58,705 --> 00:04:01,276
And..we can definitely
come down to the police station..

42
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:02,979
...and give our statement.

43
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,055
You can.

44
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:08,218
Sorry, madam. But what to do.

45
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:10,394
It's our job you see..

46
00:04:10,617 --> 00:04:15,032
We remember our duty,
but not sympathy.

47
00:04:15,154 --> 00:04:17,156
Dirty, insensitive people.

48
00:04:43,716 --> 00:04:46,959
"Heaven..Heaven.."

49
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:49,967
"..is what the hear-t screams out for."

50
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:53,803
"Hell..Hell.."

51
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,841
"..is what the hear-t shows you."

52
00:04:57,163 --> 00:05:03,444
"The hear-t is scared of shattering."

53
00:05:03,903 --> 00:05:10,343
"But is breaking it apart in pieces.."

54
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:15,723
"O hear-t..what do
you want my tormentor.."

55
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:19,730
"What do you want O cruel heart."

56
00:05:24,057 --> 00:05:29,131
"O hear-t..what do
you want my tormentor.."

57
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:33,300
"What do you want O cruel heart."

58
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:36,904
"The hear-t doesn't know."

59
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:43,053
"The hear-t doesn't know."

60
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:50,260
Through our police sources we've
found out that this is an accident.

61
00:05:50,316 --> 00:05:52,353
"But this can also be suicide.

62
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:54,722
Last night at 3am,
the guard of his building..

63
00:05:54,787 --> 00:05:56,926
...saw him fall from his flat.

64
00:05:59,325 --> 00:06:00,861
Ramona, what the hell, dude.

65
00:06:00,927 --> 00:06:01,962
I just heard it over the new.

66
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:06,943
Are you okay? - Okay. Om and
I never had an amazing love story.

67
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:10,109
Who would know that better than you?

68
00:06:10,503 --> 00:06:12,710
Marriage with Om
was like the five rings.

69
00:06:12,772 --> 00:06:15,309
First the engagement ring.
Then the wedding ring.

70
00:06:15,508 --> 00:06:17,920
Then suffe-ring.
Then endu-ring.

71
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:20,285
And finally tonu-ring.

72
00:06:20,813 --> 00:06:23,316
But this quite sucks. It's very sad.

73
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:27,195
If you're feeling so sad,
then come to my farmhouse tonight.

74
00:06:27,754 --> 00:06:30,792
I am need of sympathy.

75
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:36,330
"O hear-t..what do
you want my tormentor.."

76
00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:40,336
"What do you want O cruel heart."

77
00:06:44,804 --> 00:06:46,408
I missed your lips.

78
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:49,045
What?

79
00:06:50,209 --> 00:06:53,383
Nothing. - Say. What?

80
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:55,457
When your husband
fell from the building..

81
00:06:56,549 --> 00:06:58,927
...were you at home?

82
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:02,125
You mean to say I pushed Om to death.

83
00:07:03,055 --> 00:07:04,500
I am not saying, just asking.

84
00:07:04,857 --> 00:07:06,336
Isn't that a bit too stereotype.

85
00:07:06,859 --> 00:07:09,499
Just because I didn't love Om,
and I love sex.

86
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:11,269
Means I am a murderer.

87
00:07:14,133 --> 00:07:17,945
The police has officially declared
Om Raichand's death as an accident.

88
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:19,608
Ramona Raichands lawyer..

89
00:07:19,672 --> 00:07:22,881
...last night showed the building's
CCTV footages to the police.

90
00:07:23,042 --> 00:07:25,921
...and it proves that
when Om Raichand fell..

91
00:07:26,078 --> 00:07:28,820
It's paid news.
- Ramona Raichand wasn't at home.

92
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:31,721
You can clearly see that.

93
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:36,230
"At 11:15 pm, Ramona Raichand
steps out of her building.

94
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:40,036
And returns at 3:05am.

95
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:48,538
"Is this my tear..or my love?"

96
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:54,051
"Why is my hear-t
pouring out of my eyes?"

97
00:07:55,274 --> 00:08:01,850
"Am I losing myself,
or have I found myself."

98
00:08:01,914 --> 00:08:07,887
"Why is the hear-t
reminiscing old memories?"

99
00:08:08,855 --> 00:08:15,101
"Fears to be vast like the ocean."

100
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:22,135
"But is breaking it apart in pieces.."

101
00:08:22,201 --> 00:08:24,181
"O heart."

102
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:32,314
Amazing Pam/-

103
00:08:35,781 --> 00:08:37,351
"O heart."

104
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:40,364
Have you seen better eyes?

105
00:08:40,987 --> 00:08:43,900
Have you seen better eyes?

106
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:49,363
Have you seen better eyes?

107
00:08:49,595 --> 00:08:54,237
"O hear-t..what do
you want my tormentor.."

108
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:58,314
"What do you want O cruel heart."

109
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:01,409
"The hear-t doesn't know."

110
00:09:05,144 --> 00:09:08,057
"The hear-t doesn't know."

111
00:09:11,984 --> 00:09:14,965
"The hear-t doesn't know."

112
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:31,780
"Let me live"

113
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:34,882
"Let it be, O heart."

114
00:09:35,374 --> 00:09:38,753
"Let it be.."

115
00:09:38,811 --> 00:09:41,724
"Let me live, O heart."

116
00:10:08,874 --> 00:10:10,353
You cut yourself again.

117
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:13,117
No, I fell down.

118
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:17,660
I am your psychiatrist,
at least don't lie to me.

119
00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:23,367
This thing that you do to yourself,
'SH'..Self-Harm.

120
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:25,766
Do you know how dangerous this is?

121
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:29,373
If you ever cut an artery,
you will die.

122
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:32,071
You'll bleed yourself to death.

123
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:35,838
You know your father
is so worried about you.

124
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:41,414
Why do you do it?

125
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:44,454
I don't know, I just do it.

126
00:10:45,011 --> 00:10:47,082
I know you do it, but why?

127
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:49,717
Because I can't feel anything.

128
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:51,150
Meaning?

129
00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:54,763
The fear of cutting myself
makes me feel alive for a while.

130
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:56,690
After that 'Back to Walking Dead'.

131
00:10:57,189 --> 00:10:58,361
'Zombie Returns.'

132
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,303
Try and explain this more to me.

133
00:11:05,197 --> 00:11:07,370
Have you ever solved a jigsaw puzzle?

134
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:09,344
The big ones..with 2000 pieces?

135
00:11:10,803 --> 00:11:12,282
They make it out of
very beautiful pictures.

136
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:15,012
Landscapes, sunsets, etcetera.

137
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:19,015
But you know what,
when all the pieces are in place.

138
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:20,686
...and only one piece is missing.

139
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:22,383
The whole picture seems incomplete.

140
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:25,292
Even though the 1999
pieces are in their place.

141
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,160
"But we keep looking
at the empty space.

142
00:11:27,753 --> 00:11:29,130
And my life's just like that.

143
00:11:29,755 --> 00:11:32,395
I mean..I've everything, but there's
just one thing that's missing.

144
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:33,493
...and I don't know what it is.

145
00:11:33,726 --> 00:11:36,229
And I try my best to fill that void,
but it stays empty.

146
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:39,706
Love?

147
00:11:41,233 --> 00:11:42,177
What about love?

148
00:11:42,301 --> 00:11:43,712
What about love?

149
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:48,113
Have you ever thought that
maybe love is that missing piece?

150
00:11:50,342 --> 00:11:53,186
Love is just an excuse
to fulfill one's lust.

151
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:56,421
Every day..all around me.. ..l
see love-stories meeting a tragic end.

152
00:11:57,183 --> 00:11:58,787
So thank you so much,
but no love for me.

153
00:11:58,984 --> 00:12:01,089
I know you don't want
to talk about it, but.

154
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:04,860
...we know this is because
of your childhood, right.

155
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:10,199
You also know that your
mother was in love with..

156
00:12:10,262 --> 00:12:12,902
Why do you have to talk
about my mother all the time?

157
00:12:13,099 --> 00:12:14,305
Childhood!

158
00:12:14,834 --> 00:12:16,541
All the time! All the time!

159
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:18,874
Sam, if you think every
time you come here..

160
00:12:18,938 --> 00:12:22,317
...I'll prescribe some medicines and
you'll feel better, then that is wrong.

161
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:26,216
The things that are bothering you,
we'll have to speak about it.

162
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:28,781
I've been coming here for a year now,
and we also talk.

163
00:12:28,848 --> 00:12:29,918
But that didn't make a difference.

164
00:12:29,982 --> 00:12:31,120
But in the past one year..

165
00:12:31,183 --> 00:12:33,288
...we didn't talk about
the things that bother you.

166
00:12:33,352 --> 00:12:34,558
What?

167
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:36,289
That my mother left with someone else?

168
00:12:36,355 --> 00:12:38,062
My dad raised me alone.

169
00:12:38,124 --> 00:12:40,001
That's it. That's done.
What is the big deal about it?

170
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:41,265
The big deal is, Sam.

171
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:45,002
...that ever since that incident,
you've lost faith in love.

172
00:12:45,064 --> 00:12:47,305
And these are abandonment issues.

173
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:51,414
You think every love leads
to a betrayal, which is not true.

174
00:12:51,537 --> 00:12:53,574
What nonsense?
What has love got to do with this?

175
00:12:53,806 --> 00:12:54,580
What nonsense.

176
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,580
Bloody words, words, words
and more words. Psycho mumbo-jumbo.

177
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:59,483
You know what,
I don't want to come here anymore.

178
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:01,924
As you wish, Sam.

179
00:13:02,882 --> 00:13:04,384
But remember one thing.

180
00:13:05,584 --> 00:13:08,190
No one can live alone in this world.

181
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:11,859
Love is an important part of our life.

182
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,529
Sam, is not worth living..

183
00:13:14,593 --> 00:13:18,370
...until you find someone,
or something to die for.

184
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:20,432
You know what, leave this psychiatry.

185
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:22,570
...and stan working for some
greeting card. F*** this sh"!

186
00:14:12,751 --> 00:14:13,752
Hi, Sam.

187
00:14:14,286 --> 00:14:15,594
Meet Naomi.

188
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:20,901
Hello. - Hi, Sam.

189
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,108
If I knew you were this hot.

190
00:14:30,302 --> 00:14:32,748
"Then, I would've made
this happen much sooner.

191
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:36,909
Made what..happen?

192
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:39,013
We can trust Naomi.

193
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:42,125
She won't tell anyone
that we know each other.

194
00:14:43,315 --> 00:14:44,658
Yeah, but.

195
00:14:45,985 --> 00:14:48,795
I am the surprise Ramona
messaged you about.

196
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:54,623
Why did you leave?

197
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:58,192
Where's the surprise?

198
00:15:58,791 --> 00:15:59,394
She's sleeping.

199
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:03,206
You wore her out.
- Don't change the topic.

200
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:06,673
Why did you leave?
I arranged all this for us.

201
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:08,940
I don't know..

202
00:16:11,036 --> 00:16:12,310
Something is missing.

203
00:16:13,872 --> 00:16:15,852
Nothing seems like fun anymore.

204
00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:18,381
Not fun anymore? - What the f***

205
00:16:18,444 --> 00:16:19,752
Not fun anymore?
- Are you mad aor what?

206
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,792
Tired of me, is it? - Are you f***

207
00:16:21,847 --> 00:16:23,053
Bored of me, tell me.

208
00:16:23,115 --> 00:16:24,788
Are you f*** out of your mind,
or what?

209
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:25,894
AS *1“,

210
00:16:27,252 --> 00:16:27,923
Sam!

211
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,193
Get lost. - Sam, I am sorry.

212
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:30,925
I'll get you a new phone tomorrow.
- Pm off. I don't want it.

213
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,163
Sam, stop.
I know what is missing in your life.

214
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:34,462
What?

215
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:44,711
Things that are easily available,
don't have the same importance.

216
00:16:45,237 --> 00:16:47,217
Like jumping over
the neighbor's wall..

217
00:16:47,272 --> 00:16:52,688
...climbing his tree
and plucking his mangoes..

218
00:16:52,911 --> 00:16:57,382
...are much more sweeter than
the ones we buy in the market.

219
00:16:58,117 --> 00:17:00,893
So? - There's no
adventure in your love.

220
00:17:01,286 --> 00:17:04,096
You get everything
you like very easily.

221
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:07,863
What do you mean?

222
00:17:07,926 --> 00:17:09,769
Have you read the book 'Love Games'?

223
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:11,737
No.

224
00:17:12,164 --> 00:17:13,700
Come with me.

225
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,274
Sally explained to
her the rules of the game.

226
00:17:16,502 --> 00:17:17,879
They were quiet simple.

227
00:17:19,338 --> 00:17:24,310
Now I remember. You and I
arrive at a typical page 3 party.

228
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:29,022
Separately. And no one knows,
that we know each other.

229
00:17:42,461 --> 00:17:44,839
"The bud was thirsty."

230
00:17:46,098 --> 00:17:48,339
"Trapped the butterfly."

231
00:17:49,535 --> 00:17:52,379
"Tricked her showing his heart."

232
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:53,314
"Love Games."

233
00:17:53,372 --> 00:17:57,843
Then we look for two couples
in that party..who look the happiest.

234
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,981
The most in-love couple in the party.

235
00:18:00,045 --> 00:18:02,218
"The butterfly got angry."

236
00:18:03,449 --> 00:18:05,759
"Got all over the bud."

237
00:18:06,985 --> 00:18:09,932
"And threw the dice of her heart."

238
00:18:09,988 --> 00:18:11,763
"Love Games." - Now
the game is simple.

239
00:18:11,824 --> 00:18:14,498
Will I seduce the husband first,
or do you seduce the wife?

240
00:18:14,827 --> 00:18:18,138
So basically, do I f*** the husband
first, or do you f*** the wife.

241
00:18:18,197 --> 00:18:21,508
And whoever wins,
must give a video proof.

242
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,944
This is wicked.

243
00:18:23,001 --> 00:18:24,378
And what does the winner get?

244
00:18:24,503 --> 00:18:27,074
A week's coke supply, from the loser.

245
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:31,014
"The lights went off."

246
00:18:31,243 --> 00:18:35,316
"And the hear-t..was shattered."

247
00:18:37,516 --> 00:18:38,790
"Love Games."

248
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:43,190
"Love Games." - Ramona
Raichand, right?

249
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:45,196
Yes. - Are you okay?

250
00:18:45,824 --> 00:18:46,393
Yes.

251
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,995
Can I get you..something to drink?

252
00:18:49,194 --> 00:18:52,073
Something that can
make me forget my sorrows!

253
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:54,611
"Tricked the heart."

254
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:56,107
Sonia Raina, right?

255
00:18:57,269 --> 00:18:57,906
Yes.

256
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:01,816
Sonia, me and my friends think you're
the most beautiful woman in the party.

257
00:19:02,841 --> 00:19:03,546
Thank you.

258
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:07,147
People used to say that
Romana married Om for his money.

259
00:19:08,113 --> 00:19:11,856
But now they say that
Ramona killed Om for his money.

260
00:19:12,918 --> 00:19:14,864
Do I look like a murderer to you?

261
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:17,125
What nonsense..who says that.

262
00:19:18,257 --> 00:19:21,397
You see, I made a bet with my friends.

263
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,302
It's really embarrassing.

264
00:19:26,064 --> 00:19:31,173
Is Sili-Con to different
words for you, or one.

265
00:19:31,436 --> 00:19:33,916
Listen, I don't want
to create a scene here.

266
00:19:34,406 --> 00:19:35,885
You should quietly leave.

267
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,454
He took my number.

268
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:44,357
She almost slapped me.

269
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:45,895
This is so much fun.

270
00:19:45,951 --> 00:19:48,158
"It's the mistake of the heart."

271
00:19:49,254 --> 00:19:51,461
"Or call it a sin."

272
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:59,008
Look here, if you think.. - Before
you feel that I am following you..

273
00:19:59,164 --> 00:20:02,873
...I just want to say that I am
here to apologies, and not bother you.

274
00:20:04,102 --> 00:20:06,446
That's for you,
go ahead open it please.

275
00:20:09,441 --> 00:20:10,545
"Love Games."

276
00:20:11,109 --> 00:20:13,055
Wow! The Beetles.

277
00:20:13,278 --> 00:20:15,258
Avery Road. Original recording.

278
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:17,460
How did you know
that I like the beetles?

279
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:20,224
When you want to apologies
then it should come from the heart.

280
00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:22,423
"Trapped the butterfly."

281
00:20:23,922 --> 00:20:26,903
"Tricked her showing his heart."

282
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:27,960
"Love Games."

283
00:20:41,306 --> 00:20:43,946
"Spreads fire at night."

284
00:20:44,876 --> 00:20:47,083
"And bites me with his teeth."

285
00:20:52,884 --> 00:20:56,331
Hello. - I know you're
at Ramona Raichands farmhouse.

286
00:20:56,955 --> 00:20:58,298
Who..who..who is speaking?

287
00:20:58,357 --> 00:21:00,963
My name's Prem. Prem Chopra.

288
00:21:01,193 --> 00:21:04,402
Your wife's hired me to follow you.

289
00:21:04,796 --> 00:21:08,005
"Love Games." - I can tell
her where you are right now.

290
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,274
If you leave now,
I won't tell her anything.

291
00:21:11,803 --> 00:21:15,410
But if you don't leave in five
minutes, I'll tell her everything.

292
00:21:15,874 --> 00:21:17,649
I've to go. I've to go.

293
00:21:17,709 --> 00:21:19,620
Rishabh, what happened?
- There's a fire.

294
00:21:19,678 --> 00:21:21,180
But suddenly.
- Fire always breaks out suddenly.

295
00:21:21,246 --> 00:21:23,726
Rishabh. Rishabh. - Rishabh is dead.

296
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:26,896
Hello. - Madam,
Suresh speaking from the office.

297
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:28,829
Is sir at home?
- But sir is at the office.

298
00:21:28,887 --> 00:21:30,764
Madam, sir hasn't come
to the office since morning.

299
00:21:30,822 --> 00:21:32,426
If you talk to him,
tell him to call at the office.

300
00:21:32,658 --> 00:21:33,728
"Love Games."

301
00:21:36,361 --> 00:21:37,396
Hi, baby.

302
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:39,400
Where were you?

303
00:21:39,865 --> 00:21:44,041
I was at the office.
- Don't lie. You were not there.

304
00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:46,280
I was. - All men are the same.

305
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:48,083
Sonia. Sonia.

306
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:52,418
"Love Games." - "Ruined the heart."

307
00:21:52,944 --> 00:21:54,753
Hey, Sam. - Hey, Sonia.

308
00:21:54,913 --> 00:21:57,154
I've been waiting for
you all morning. - Why?

309
00:21:57,349 --> 00:22:01,320
You're so beautiful, every time
I close my eyes.. ..l only see you.

310
00:22:02,254 --> 00:22:05,428
And then I thought it's
better to see you in real life.

311
00:22:05,957 --> 00:22:08,938
Sam. You're sweet.

312
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:11,865
But I am married. - I know.

313
00:22:13,065 --> 00:22:14,738
But, can I ask you a question?

314
00:22:16,201 --> 00:22:19,307
Sometimes I feel,
no matter how beautiful a woman is..

315
00:22:19,705 --> 00:22:21,013
"But after the marriage,
she doesn't have..

316
00:22:21,073 --> 00:22:22,746
"The same value
in her husband's view.

317
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:25,083
Like he doesn't care anymore.

318
00:22:26,244 --> 00:22:29,020
Like she's just some beautiful
piece of furniture that he owns.

319
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:34,954
"Love Games. Darling..let's play."

320
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,021
"Love Games."

321
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:39,427
"Love Games."

322
00:22:41,827 --> 00:22:42,862
"Love Games."

323
00:22:49,167 --> 00:22:51,408
I've whatsapped the video, baby.
Check it out.

324
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:06,427
This is my love, is the happy dance.

325
00:23:08,186 --> 00:23:12,134
You called Rishabh,
you scared him right?

326
00:23:12,457 --> 00:23:13,993
It was you, wasn't you?

327
00:23:14,292 --> 00:23:18,104
Maybe, darling.. maybe not.

328
00:23:18,964 --> 00:23:20,307
You freaking cheater.

329
00:23:21,099 --> 00:23:23,477
Come on my love, salute the champion.

330
00:23:23,535 --> 00:23:25,173
Touch my feet, baby.

331
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:27,572
Ramona, touch my feet. - Stop it.

332
00:23:27,873 --> 00:23:29,079
Stop pm me off.

333
00:23:29,141 --> 00:23:31,052
What's wrong with you?
- Stop pm me off.

334
00:23:32,177 --> 00:23:34,589
What's wrong.
Okay, fine. Don't touch them.

335
00:23:34,813 --> 00:23:37,089
You like my happy dance.
- Stop laughing, Sam.

336
00:23:38,483 --> 00:23:39,325
Stop laughing.

337
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:42,087
Sam, stop.
Stop laughing. Just stop, Sam.

338
00:23:42,154 --> 00:23:43,861
You're such a bad loser.
- Stop laughing.

339
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:45,466
Sam, stop laughing.

340
00:23:47,893 --> 00:23:50,271
Sam, stop laughing. What the"

341
00:23:50,462 --> 00:23:52,339
Stop it! Stop it!

342
00:23:52,831 --> 00:23:54,367
Sam, stop laughing.

343
00:23:58,503 --> 00:24:00,574
Come back, I won't laugh.

344
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:03,108
Please. Baby.

345
00:24:03,175 --> 00:24:05,621
Laugh now.
You were finding it funny, right.

346
00:24:06,044 --> 00:24:08,046
Are you serious?
You got a gun..

347
00:24:10,081 --> 00:24:11,992
Laugh, Sam. Sam, laugh.

348
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:14,530
Are you out of your mind?
- Why aren't you laughing? Laugh.

349
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,622
F*** - I want to see you laugh, Sam.

350
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:21,927
Laugh! Laugh! Laugh!
Laugh!

351
00:24:21,993 --> 00:24:25,406
What the f*** is wrong with you?
- Laugh! Laugh! Laugh! Laugh!

352
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:27,603
Just stop" - Stop it!

353
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:29,502
Stop it! - Come here.

354
00:24:30,368 --> 00:24:32,439
Stop it, Sam. F*** you!

355
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:47,056
I am sorry I got so p**** off.

356
00:25:48,246 --> 00:25:49,748
You almost killed me.

357
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:54,758
But unfortunately I missed.
- Unfortunate my a***.

358
00:25:55,854 --> 00:25:59,063
You know..l am addicted to winning.

359
00:26:00,859 --> 00:26:02,839
I cannot endure to lose.

360
00:26:04,129 --> 00:26:07,008
I want to just strangle the winner.

361
00:26:08,833 --> 00:26:10,676
I am used to winning.

362
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:12,848
<i>It's</i> my <i>obsession.</i>

363
00:26:13,104 --> 00:26:14,310
You're fu“ of 8*“

364
00:27:03,989 --> 00:27:05,400
Go my friend..

365
00:27:07,025 --> 00:27:11,770
Go find some pain,
that can reduce my pain.

366
00:27:51,403 --> 00:27:53,280
Madam, please..

367
00:27:54,272 --> 00:27:58,049
I am so sorry, I am sorry.

368
00:28:53,932 --> 00:28:56,708
Your petals are running my carpet.

369
00:28:57,836 --> 00:28:58,644
Oh..

370
00:29:00,672 --> 00:29:02,151
Please, pick it up.

371
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:05,077
Yeah, I was just doing that.

372
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,923
Who sent these?
- I guess from the hospital.

373
00:29:14,285 --> 00:29:15,355
I don't know.

374
00:29:15,954 --> 00:29:17,627
Don't know, or don't want to tell.

375
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:20,733
Gaurav, what's not to tell?

376
00:29:21,192 --> 00:29:23,638
They are just flowers.
What's the big deal?

377
00:29:26,331 --> 00:29:27,901
Come on, Alisha.

378
00:29:29,901 --> 00:29:31,278
No one sends flowers without a reason.

379
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:34,980
You're my wife. My property.

380
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:37,877
Who are you sleeping with?
- Please Gaurav, you're hurting me.

381
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:39,944
I am hurting you! I am hurting you!

382
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:41,985
Who sent these flowers?

383
00:29:42,213 --> 00:29:44,284
Honestly, I really don't know.

384
00:29:44,349 --> 00:29:46,260
You're lying. You're lying.

385
00:29:46,317 --> 00:29:48,923
I don't know, I am not lying.
- I am going to kill you.

386
00:29:48,987 --> 00:29:50,398
And I'll get locked up
behind bars because of you.

387
00:29:50,755 --> 00:29:54,601
I really don't know. - And
before I kill you, out of my house.

388
00:29:54,659 --> 00:29:56,297
Out! Get out of my house!

389
00:29:56,361 --> 00:29:58,272
What are you doing?
Gaurav!

390
00:29:59,164 --> 00:30:01,303
Gaurav, you're mistaken.

391
00:30:01,699 --> 00:30:03,804
Gaurav, please open the door.

392
00:30:23,054 --> 00:30:24,431
Gaurav, please.

393
00:30:25,924 --> 00:30:27,164
Gaurav!

394
00:30:28,626 --> 00:30:29,798
Gaurav!

395
00:30:49,814 --> 00:30:50,656
Wake up.

396
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:53,260
I am going to the office.

397
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:55,431
There's a party at GitanjalFs place.

398
00:30:55,987 --> 00:30:58,763
Be there by 9:30.
Can I expect that much from you?

399
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:00,068
That you look pretty.

400
00:31:00,325 --> 00:31:02,862
And show that you're a nice,
happy wife.

401
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:05,238
Clients like lawyers with pretty wife.

402
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:06,970
And they are important clients.

403
00:31:07,832 --> 00:31:09,436
I should get some
benefit of marrying you.

404
00:31:09,767 --> 00:31:10,472
After all..

405
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:02,063
Want a drink.

406
00:32:02,787 --> 00:32:03,595
Sure.

407
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:05,731
Come, come.

408
00:32:28,713 --> 00:32:29,657
Hi.

409
00:32:31,049 --> 00:32:31,823
Hi.

410
00:32:32,383 --> 00:32:34,829
Sam. Sameer Saxena. - I know.

411
00:32:35,253 --> 00:32:36,664
Son of Ashish Saxena.

412
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:39,196
Blue Sky Flight Kitchen
And Deep Blue Confectionaries.

413
00:32:39,824 --> 00:32:43,328
Nice, I guess you follow page 3.

414
00:32:43,661 --> 00:32:45,766
Sadly, page 3 follows us.

415
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:47,136
Celebrity overload.

416
00:32:49,067 --> 00:32:50,205
That's a good one.

417
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:55,443
So, you were standing here alone.

418
00:32:56,107 --> 00:32:57,108
Weren't you getting bored?

419
00:32:57,809 --> 00:33:01,382
How can I get bored alone?
There was no one to bore me.

420
00:33:03,881 --> 00:33:04,951
Okay. .

421
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:09,096
Okay!

422
00:33:17,128 --> 00:33:18,436
It's called 'SH'.

423
00:33:22,467 --> 00:33:23,468
What?

424
00:33:24,268 --> 00:33:27,943
Those various medals on your body,
it's called 'SH'.

425
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:29,280
Self Harm.

426
00:33:29,807 --> 00:33:31,946
How do you know? - I hope
you're getting treated for it.

427
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:33,879
Can be quite dangerous.

428
00:33:34,946 --> 00:33:38,860
I guess..when I can't feel anything,
I feel pain.

429
00:33:42,053 --> 00:33:43,464
It's a strange world.

430
00:33:45,723 --> 00:33:47,999
Some people can't endure pain..

431
00:33:48,926 --> 00:33:51,065
...while others can't feel pain.

432
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:01,949
Alisha, something urgent has come up..

433
00:34:02,006 --> 00:34:04,145
...so I had to leave immediately.

434
00:34:07,645 --> 00:34:09,818
Don't disturb me.
Take a cab home.

435
00:34:10,181 --> 00:34:11,285
WOW!

436
00:34:12,183 --> 00:34:13,321
That's great.

437
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:17,230
My husband doesn't feel the
need of saying bye to me personally.

438
00:34:17,422 --> 00:34:18,958
He said it over a sms.

439
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:20,828
Anyway, saves me the trouble.

440
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:23,736
Nice talking to you.
- If you want, I can drop you.

441
00:34:24,162 --> 00:34:27,405
You mean I've to decide between
you and the OLA cab driver.

442
00:34:27,698 --> 00:34:30,838
Wonder who I can trust more.
- I mean, you can trust me.

443
00:34:31,135 --> 00:34:33,911
I only inflict pain to myself,
and not others.

444
00:34:35,106 --> 00:34:37,279
Come on, you drop me home.

445
00:34:43,347 --> 00:34:44,917
You didn't tell me your name?

446
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:46,988
Alisha Asthana.

447
00:34:47,485 --> 00:34:50,125
And that man who left
me alone at the party.

448
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:52,701
That was my husband.
Gaurav Asthana.

449
00:34:52,824 --> 00:34:55,134
The famous criminal lawyer,
right? - Yes.

450
00:34:56,861 --> 00:34:58,169
So, what do you do?

451
00:34:58,262 --> 00:34:59,969
Excuse me. Hello.

452
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:02,177
<i>Yes, Swat}.</i>

453
00:35:03,234 --> 00:35:04,975
Oh my, God! Yeah. I'll be right there.

454
00:35:05,369 --> 00:35:06,313
Everything okay?

455
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:08,179
Can you take me to
the Mumbai Memorial please?

456
00:35:08,306 --> 00:35:10,513
What's wrong? Anything serious?
- My patient is serious?

457
00:35:10,808 --> 00:35:13,049
Patient? - Yeah, please hurry up.

458
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:14,146
Yeah, sure.

459
00:35:25,756 --> 00:35:27,258
Thank you. - You're welcome.

460
00:35:39,337 --> 00:35:41,578
Do you want to know what pain is?

461
00:35:43,608 --> 00:35:44,814
Come with me.

462
00:35:53,618 --> 00:35:54,892

00:35:54,952 --> 00:35:56,226

Patient is in inter cardial-hemorrhage,
early signs of a stroke.

00:36:13,037 --> 00:36:15,278
Where's Dr. Shah?

00:36:20,978 --> 00:36:22,286
Rush. - Yes, ma'am.

"O..l am so lost."

511
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:58,200
"Lost in a new feeling."

00:40:03,834 --> 00:40:05,780
"The wounds.."

513
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:10,148
"I do not see."

514
00:40:11,942 --> 00:40:18,860
"But somethingsomething is healing."

515
00:40:20,451 --> 00:40:22,158
If you're not in the mood, just say.

528
00:42:01,585 --> 00:42:09,299
"Healing..so healing."

529
00:42:14,899 --> 00:42:17,505
I thank Dr. Kambli for that enlightening presentation.

530
00:42:17,568 --> 00:42:21,345
And may I now request everyone to take a
break for tea and snack before we resume.

531
00:42:44,495 --> 00:42:45,997
Mr. Sameer Saxena, right.

532
00:42:46,997 --> 00:42:47,907
Oh, hi.

533
00:42:48,632 --> 00:42:50,839
I noticed that you were
following me in Mumbai.

534
00:42:51,001 --> 00:42:53,140
But I didn't know you
will come all the way to Goa.

535
00:42:53,437 --> 00:42:55,815
No, actually I came
here for some work.

536
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:57,112
L--

537
00:43:01,478 --> 00:43:02,513
You're right.

538
00:43:03,948 --> 00:43:05,256
I've been following you.

539
00:43:05,816 --> 00:43:07,887
Right, so I think we
need to talk about this.

540
00:43:08,052 --> 00:43:09,725
Why are you following me?

541
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:12,495
I don't know.

542
00:43:13,991 --> 00:43:16,130
I don't know, just. - Just what.

543
00:43:17,127 --> 00:43:18,800
Let me make this easy for you, come.

544
00:43:39,149 --> 00:43:40,492
What are you doing?

545
00:43:41,652 --> 00:43:42,756
What are you doing?

546
00:43:54,898 --> 00:43:56,775
These wounds have been
inflicted by my husband.

547
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:00,672
The night before I left for Goa.

548
00:44:05,009 --> 00:44:06,317
It pains so much, that.

549
00:44:06,543 --> 00:44:08,614
...even when the shin touches
the wound, I feel like screaming.

550
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:16,090
I can't sit, or sleep.

551
00:44:17,788 --> 00:44:18,926
Painkillers keep alive.

552
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:26,063
You know that my
marriage is networking.

553
00:44:29,967 --> 00:44:31,537
But I am not the unhappy housewife.

554
00:44:31,602 --> 00:44:33,240
...that you can f***
and have an affair with.

555
00:44:43,881 --> 00:44:47,260
Also, I don't think I can tolerate
anymore abuse for any reason.

556
00:44:47,918 --> 00:44:51,058
So take my advice,
and follow some other girl.

557
00:44:51,689 --> 00:44:53,566
Because you won't get
what you're looking for.

558
00:44:54,825 --> 00:44:56,099
Go back to Mumbai.

559
00:45:55,919 --> 00:45:56,920
So you didn't go back.

560
00:45:58,856 --> 00:46:03,134
I tried..but I can't.

561
00:46:06,964 --> 00:46:10,810
I want to tell you something,
but I can't.

562
00:46:15,005 --> 00:46:15,983
80..

563
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:22,117
Just listen to this.

564
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:48,978
"My head's fed up..of
wandering around."

565
00:46:49,606 --> 00:46:54,715
"And star-ted dwelling in your lanes."

566
00:46:55,078 --> 00:47:00,721
"Like I did for no one.."

567
00:47:00,851 --> 00:47:06,597
"..l star-ted caring for you."

568
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:12,800
"I want to drink your tears,
or make you laugh."

569
00:47:12,930 --> 00:47:15,774
"Just look at you from afar.."

570
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:18,643
"..or let you dwell in my heart."

571
00:47:18,702 --> 00:47:24,209
"I want to live for you..or
just give it all up for you."

572
00:47:24,274 --> 00:47:31,988
"My sweetheart, you're my life."

573
00:47:32,716 --> 00:47:39,190
"Only you.."

574
00:47:40,757 --> 00:47:46,264
"My head's fed up..of
wandering around."

575
00:47:46,330 --> 00:47:52,281
"And star-ted dwelling in your lanes."

576
00:47:52,803 --> 00:47:58,344
"I want to drink your tears,
or make you laugh."

577
00:47:58,408 --> 00:48:01,184
"Just look at you from afar.."

578
00:48:01,245 --> 00:48:04,124
"..or let you dwell in my heart."

579
00:48:04,181 --> 00:48:09,790
"I want to live for you..or
just give it all up for you."

580
00:48:09,853 --> 00:48:17,863
"My sweetheart, you're my life."

581
00:48:18,262 --> 00:48:23,336
"Only you.."

582
00:48:24,001 --> 00:48:25,947
Hello. - Where are you these days?

583
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:30,048
L..am in Hyderabad. For some work.

584
00:48:30,874 --> 00:48:34,822
You work also.
- Yes, Ramona. Don't be funny.

585
00:48:44,354 --> 00:48:49,354
"I was never myself..nor of God."

586
00:48:55,799 --> 00:49:01,181
"Since I met you.."

587
00:49:01,872 --> 00:49:06,753
"..now I belong to you."

588
00:49:06,877 --> 00:49:12,384
"But now I've star-ted
believing in myself."

589
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:19,094
"Don't change..after
changing my faith."

590
00:49:23,727 --> 00:49:24,831
Excuse me.

591
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:51,856
'How dare you.'

592
00:49:57,127 --> 00:49:58,162
Are you okay?

593
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:01,133
Alisha!

594
00:50:04,234 --> 00:50:09,684
"What do I ask..from your God."

595
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:15,185
"I don't know..how to pray."

596
00:50:15,712 --> 00:50:21,287
"How do I fall in love?"

597
00:50:21,351 --> 00:50:26,664
"I don't know how to be loyal."

598
00:50:27,424 --> 00:50:33,204
"But every time I look at you,
my hear-t staggers."

599
00:50:33,263 --> 00:50:39,009
"You call out to me.."

600
00:50:39,069 --> 00:50:44,644
"You make me feel great."

601
00:50:44,908 --> 00:50:47,445
"You're my faith, my love."

602
00:50:47,677 --> 00:50:51,784
"Only you."

603
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:56,359
"It's you."

604
00:50:59,056 --> 00:51:03,436
"It's you."

605
00:51:20,010 --> 00:51:22,752
So finally Sam Saxena found someone.

606
00:51:24,815 --> 00:51:25,793
You were right.

607
00:51:26,049 --> 00:51:27,084
Life is not worth living..

608
00:51:27,150 --> 00:51:28,595
...till you have someone to die for.

609
00:51:29,486 --> 00:51:31,523
Wow! Greeting cards.

610
00:51:34,491 --> 00:51:37,597
I hope you will never
cut yourself again.

611
00:51:39,896 --> 00:51:41,204
Instead of inflicting pain to myself..

612
00:51:41,431 --> 00:51:42,705
...I share someone's pain.

613
00:51:43,066 --> 00:51:44,044
Feels good.

614
00:51:44,568 --> 00:51:45,569
Good.

615
00:51:50,507 --> 00:51:51,781
Hello. - Sam.

616
00:51:52,209 --> 00:51:53,085
Sam, where are you?

617
00:51:53,143 --> 00:51:54,884
Ramona, what happened?
Why are you crying?

618
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:57,118
I can't tell you over the phone.
Come quickly.

619
00:51:57,180 --> 00:52:00,889
Okay, okay, I am coming. Take it easy.
Take it easy, I am coming.

620
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:04,624
Hello, Sam.

621
00:52:08,058 --> 00:52:10,561
What the hell, Sam? Is this a joke?

622
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:11,830
What can I do?

623
00:52:12,162 --> 00:52:14,699
These days you're
like the fire brigade.

624
00:52:14,998 --> 00:52:17,000
You only come when
there's an emergency.

625
00:52:17,067 --> 00:52:18,637
What nonsense.

626
00:52:19,169 --> 00:52:21,115
Come on, Sam. Come with me.

627
00:52:21,538 --> 00:52:22,881
I want to show you something.

628
00:52:23,173 --> 00:52:25,153
What? - Sit. Sit. Sit.

629
00:52:26,276 --> 00:52:27,254
One second.

630
00:52:36,086 --> 00:52:40,091
First time Hyderabad
is looking like Goa.

631
00:52:42,826 --> 00:52:47,241
You bloody dog.
You're in love and you didn't tell me.

632
00:52:48,031 --> 00:52:50,068
You fell in love while
playing the love games.

633
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:53,246
"Lustful love."

634
00:52:53,637 --> 00:52:56,641
I was going to tell you,
but I'm glad you found out.

635
00:52:57,674 --> 00:53:01,247
So now, you lucky boy.
Best of both worlds, huh!

636
00:53:02,112 --> 00:53:02,886
What do you mean?

637
00:53:02,946 --> 00:53:06,223
Classical piano..and hard rock.

638
00:53:07,184 --> 00:53:08,686
Get the drift, right?

639
00:53:12,122 --> 00:53:14,193
Now don't start getting
ridiculous, Ramona.

640
00:53:14,791 --> 00:53:17,795
Why? What's ridiculous about it?

641
00:53:18,395 --> 00:53:21,706
Keep loving her. I don't care.

642
00:53:22,332 --> 00:53:26,075
But whenever I call, you must come.

643
00:53:26,937 --> 00:53:28,007
0K8'!-

644
00:53:34,611 --> 00:53:37,888
Ramona, all this is over for me now.

645
00:53:38,315 --> 00:53:41,387
Sex, drugs, cutting myself..
I am done with it.

646
00:53:41,851 --> 00:53:43,853
For all these years, there
was something missing in my life.

647
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:45,263
And I didn't know what it was.

648
00:53:46,256 --> 00:53:48,293
But after meeting Alisha, now I know.

649
00:53:48,992 --> 00:53:50,164
Its love.

650
00:53:51,695 --> 00:53:53,834
Love changed everything for me.

651
00:53:54,130 --> 00:53:56,303
I don't feel the void for anything.

652
00:53:56,733 --> 00:53:58,644
And finally, I am happy.

653
00:53:59,369 --> 00:54:00,973
What about you and me?

654
00:54:01,438 --> 00:54:03,349
We can always be good friends.

655
00:54:05,242 --> 00:54:08,780
You idiot, do I look like
the 'good friend's type to you?

656
00:54:09,112 --> 00:54:11,786
I don't want friends. I want you.

657
00:54:11,848 --> 00:54:14,419
Love Games.
Par-ties, but only with you.

658
00:54:14,985 --> 00:54:17,261
I am sorry, I am no longer that Sam.

659
00:54:17,721 --> 00:54:21,726
Sam! Sam! Sam!
Sam! My baby, what's wrong with you.

660
00:54:21,791 --> 00:54:24,067
You're scuba-diving, that's all.

661
00:54:24,327 --> 00:54:27,706
You know, this underwater
world of love is not for you.

662
00:54:27,864 --> 00:54:31,744
You will run out of oxygen, baby.
And you will have to come out.

663
00:54:33,670 --> 00:54:35,149
I feel pity for you.

664
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:39,213
You never realized what true love is.

665
00:54:39,709 --> 00:54:41,916
I wish one day you
find out what love is.

666
00:54:42,979 --> 00:54:43,980
Sad!

667
00:54:46,750 --> 00:54:48,889
Just a minute Mr. Sameer Saxena!

668
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:51,758
You're telling me what love is.

669
00:54:52,088 --> 00:54:55,194
I know what love is more
than any f**** body in the world.

670
00:54:55,825 --> 00:54:57,270
Love is a weakness.

671
00:54:57,861 --> 00:55:00,967
An alcoholic, that's it.
Ask for self-pity.

672
00:55:01,464 --> 00:55:04,308
Weakness, like the uncle that kept
coming in my room and molesting me..

673
00:55:04,367 --> 00:55:05,869
"But no one asked him.

674
00:55:06,236 --> 00:55:08,375
A weakness like the tears
I shed for the boyfriend.

675
00:55:08,438 --> 00:55:10,315
...that got me pregnant and left.

676
00:55:10,707 --> 00:55:13,017
I don't want this weakness.
You can have it.

677
00:55:13,209 --> 00:55:15,519
I want what I want, and that is you.

678
00:55:15,745 --> 00:55:16,849
You cannot have me.

679
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:19,057
I am sorry, but you will
have to forget about all this.

680
00:55:19,115 --> 00:55:22,460
Sam, I told you before, I hate losing.

681
00:55:23,019 --> 00:55:25,226
I won't let you go so easily.

682
00:55:25,288 --> 00:55:27,791
I've already moved on.
You just have to get used to it.

683
00:56:19,976 --> 00:56:21,011
Sam.

684
00:56:21,644 --> 00:56:24,648
We've just begun a new Love Game.

685
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:50,235
"Let me cry..
these are tears of happiness."

686
00:57:02,218 --> 00:57:12,037
"This never happened to me..
Love."

687
00:57:18,802 --> 00:57:26,016
"Let me laugh. Laugh out loud."

688
00:57:29,913 --> 00:57:33,690
"This never.."

689
00:57:35,585 --> 00:57:36,290
You okay?

690
00:57:37,153 --> 00:57:37,995
Yeah.

691
00:57:38,555 --> 00:57:39,124
Why?

692
00:57:39,823 --> 00:57:41,097
Whenever I am away from you..

693
00:57:41,658 --> 00:57:43,763
...I am constantly frightened
whether you're okay or not.

694
00:57:44,727 --> 00:57:47,230
Whether your husband
hum you again or not?

695
00:57:48,298 --> 00:57:49,572
Hoping he's not hum you.

696
00:57:51,201 --> 00:57:52,805
Even if he does, I am used to it.

697
00:57:53,736 --> 00:57:56,740
He can't do anything that
he hasn't done before.

698
00:57:56,806 --> 00:57:59,218
Why, Alisha?

699
00:58:00,877 --> 00:58:02,720
You're educated. You're a surgeon.

700
00:58:02,846 --> 00:58:04,553
You can take care of yourself.

701
00:58:04,647 --> 00:58:06,820
Why don't you leave him?
Why don't you divorce him?

702
00:58:09,853 --> 00:58:11,093
Because I am scared of him.

703
00:58:15,625 --> 00:58:16,763
What do you think, Sam?

704
00:58:17,894 --> 00:58:19,805
Didn't I try to get away from him?

705
00:58:20,864 --> 00:58:22,070
When I tried to make
a police complain.

706
00:58:22,131 --> 00:58:23,974
...no one registered my FIR.

707
00:58:26,202 --> 00:58:29,115
I married Gaurav against
my parent's will.

708
00:58:30,740 --> 00:58:32,014
How will I face them now?

709
00:58:33,776 --> 00:58:36,154
You know, one time I left
my house to stay with a friend.

710
00:58:37,614 --> 00:58:38,854
And he came there.

711
00:58:39,949 --> 00:58:40,859
Drunk.

712
00:58:42,151 --> 00:58:43,789
And he created a scene.

713
00:58:43,853 --> 00:58:46,094
"That, I was even
scared for my friend.

714
00:58:47,790 --> 00:58:49,133
He's a very powerful lawyer.

715
00:58:51,194 --> 00:58:52,264
He knows everyone.

716
00:58:53,863 --> 00:58:55,672
From the police to ministers.

717
00:58:57,800 --> 00:58:59,006
There's nothing I can do.

718
00:59:02,605 --> 00:59:03,777
I am helpless.

719
00:59:07,143 --> 00:59:09,316
"Let it fall."

720
00:59:09,379 --> 00:59:12,360
Hey..you're not helpless.

721
00:59:13,516 --> 00:59:15,154
I am with you.

722
00:59:16,553 --> 00:59:18,897
And I promise I won't
let anything happen to you.

723
00:59:19,122 --> 00:59:26,267
Come here.

724
00:59:26,829 --> 00:59:30,800
"What just happened
between me and you."

725
00:59:31,401 --> 00:59:32,880
"Love.."

726
00:59:34,571 --> 00:59:37,916
"Don't be scared, O heart."

727
00:59:39,776 --> 00:59:45,692
"It'll make us cry,
make us laugh. Love.."

728
00:59:46,783 --> 00:59:48,854
Sorry. I am sorry. Sorry.

729
00:59:51,654 --> 00:59:52,724
Sorry.

730
00:59:54,757 --> 00:59:57,431
Hi, Alisha. - Hi.

731
00:59:57,794 --> 01:00:00,138
Happy birthday. - Thank you.
Thank you so much.

732
01:00:00,196 --> 01:00:01,698
Why are you standing alone?
Where is Gaurav?

733
01:00:01,764 --> 01:00:03,710
Gaurav is late. He must be on the way.

734
01:00:04,167 --> 01:00:05,544
Oh, speak of the devil.

735
01:00:06,402 --> 01:00:07,574
Hi.- Hi.

736
01:00:07,637 --> 01:00:10,277
Happy birthday. Happy birthday.
- Thank you. Thank you so much.

737
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:12,251
You're looking lovely. - Thank you.

738
01:00:12,408 --> 01:00:15,446
Drink. - Yeah, good idea.
Hey, I'll handle it.

739
01:00:15,511 --> 01:00:16,717
Okay. - Waiter.

740
01:00:21,551 --> 01:00:23,861
Actually, I'll have two.
- Have them all.

741
01:00:29,359 --> 01:00:31,737
Oh my, God. What's wrong with you?
What are you doing, Gaurav?

742
01:00:32,829 --> 01:00:35,469
Stop it. Take it easy.
Guys, please help.

743
01:00:35,531 --> 01:00:37,238
Who is he?

744
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:39,980
Who is he?
You sleep with everyone.

745
01:00:40,269 --> 01:00:42,408
I will kill you. I will kill you.

746
01:00:42,672 --> 01:00:44,208
I will be jailed because of her.

747
01:00:44,674 --> 01:00:47,553
What did you think? I wouldn't know.

748
01:00:47,744 --> 01:00:49,746
I know everything.
Bloody.. - Gaurav.

749
01:00:49,812 --> 01:00:52,622
Leave me. Since we got married,
she's made my life hell.

750
01:00:52,749 --> 01:00:54,490
Every day it's a new affair.

751
01:00:54,550 --> 01:00:57,656
I am telling you, I will kill you.

752
01:00:57,820 --> 01:00:59,322
I won't spare you!

753
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:01,435
I am talking to you.

754
01:01:30,753 --> 01:01:32,733
Alisha, are you fine?

755
01:01:33,156 --> 01:01:36,103
Come here. Come here.
Are you okay?

756
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:39,205
Come, sit.

757
01:01:53,943 --> 01:01:56,219
This is our company's guest house.

758
01:01:58,047 --> 01:01:59,355
No one will come here.

759
01:02:05,388 --> 01:02:07,800
Look, I've kept a shampoo
and switched on the geyser.

760
01:02:08,291 --> 01:02:09,429
You can take a shower.

761
01:02:16,199 --> 01:02:17,075
Alisha!

762
01:02:23,072 --> 01:02:24,847
I want to die, Sam.

763
01:02:27,176 --> 01:02:29,247
I can't live like this.

764
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:32,224
No!

765
01:02:33,149 --> 01:02:35,151
Just kill me, Sam. Please.

766
01:02:37,954 --> 01:02:38,830
Please.

767
01:02:44,727 --> 01:02:48,334
Don't worry, I'll wash and
dry the dress. It won't take time.

768
01:02:49,398 --> 01:02:50,274
Sam.

769
01:02:51,934 --> 01:02:52,708
Yeah.

770
01:02:52,969 --> 01:02:53,709
Thank you.

771
01:02:55,505 --> 01:02:58,111
You're the only one left now.
My sole support

772
01:03:00,076 --> 01:03:01,487
Don't ever break my heart Sam.

773
01:03:03,045 --> 01:03:03,887
I love you.

774
01:03:06,048 --> 01:03:06,924
I love you too.

775
01:03:54,864 --> 01:03:56,775
Got something to do with all this,
don't you?

776
01:03:57,600 --> 01:04:00,581
You know, Sam.
These kidnapping type films.

777
01:04:00,803 --> 01:04:03,750
First someone get kidnapped,
then they make a ransom call.

778
01:04:03,873 --> 01:04:05,944
The police say "Don't give the money".

779
01:04:06,108 --> 01:04:08,384
And hearing this the
kidnappers get really angry.

780
01:04:08,711 --> 01:04:11,749
And then they cut a finger
of the kidnapped victim and send it.

781
01:04:12,014 --> 01:04:14,392
I always think after
seeing such movies.

782
01:04:14,851 --> 01:04:18,025
...they should've sent the finger first,
it would've saved lot of time. Right?

783
01:04:19,021 --> 01:04:20,261
What the hell are you talking about?

784
01:04:23,726 --> 01:04:26,707
I thought I should star-t
with the finger first.

785
01:04:28,664 --> 01:04:31,144
'Deliver it to the
address I gave you.'

786
01:04:32,969 --> 01:04:33,845
'Parcelf

787
01:04:46,082 --> 01:04:50,428
Alisha's husband is no.1..
like a mad bull.

788
01:04:50,786 --> 01:04:53,767
As soon as he sees a red cloth, he
charges immediately with his head down.

789
01:04:53,890 --> 01:04:55,392
Come to the point, what do you want?

790
01:04:55,925 --> 01:04:58,030
Are you like serious? Asking me that.

791
01:04:58,227 --> 01:04:59,205
I want you.

792
01:05:01,764 --> 01:05:04,745
Ramona, understand.
that is not possible.

793
01:05:05,201 --> 01:05:07,044
Really, think about it.

794
01:05:07,436 --> 01:05:10,383
If you don't come to me,
I'll get furious.

795
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:12,686
And I'll show the red cloth to Mr.
Bull again.

796
01:05:12,842 --> 01:05:14,014
And he'll get angry.

797
01:05:14,076 --> 01:05:16,454
And he'll beat your delicate darling.

798
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:24,129
On the other hand,
if I am happy..I'll be quiet.

799
01:05:24,353 --> 01:05:27,425
So Mr. Bull not angry,
and delicate darling not hum.

800
01:05:27,657 --> 01:05:29,330
See..everyone happy.

801
01:05:30,092 --> 01:05:31,469
Trying to blackmail me.

802
01:05:32,862 --> 01:05:34,773
If that's the case,
then I'll tell Alisha everything.

803
01:05:36,165 --> 01:05:38,907
Sam. What will you tell Alisha?

804
01:05:39,268 --> 01:05:40,372
That she was a Love Game?

805
01:05:40,703 --> 01:05:43,707
You were supposed to do her,
before I did her husband.

806
01:05:43,839 --> 01:05:47,252
Or that..she was
embarrassed in the party.

807
01:05:47,376 --> 01:05:50,255
...because I wasn't playing
Love Games with Ramona.

808
01:05:50,813 --> 01:05:54,124
If she sees your true face,
she will be so hum.

809
01:05:54,250 --> 01:05:56,355
Even Gaurav couldn't
have hum her so much.

810
01:05:57,153 --> 01:05:58,188
Do you want that?

811
01:06:06,295 --> 01:06:09,367
Come on, Sam. Lily is having
a rave tonight, let's go.

812
01:06:09,432 --> 01:06:10,308
Are you mad?

813
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:12,335
Alisha is upstairs.

814
01:06:12,902 --> 01:06:14,848
She's not doing well. She's depressed.

815
01:06:15,171 --> 01:06:18,084
Oh..I'm depressed too.

816
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:19,241
Get off me.

817
01:06:23,346 --> 01:06:26,884
Should I tell Gaurav that Alisha
is sleeping in your guesthouse?

818
01:06:27,750 --> 01:06:28,785
Come on, Sam.

819
01:06:29,085 --> 01:06:30,928
If you want to have
a extra-marital affair..

820
01:06:30,987 --> 01:06:33,228
...then you must give some
extra attention to me as well.

821
01:06:43,599 --> 01:06:47,240
"Hey..hello my friend."

822
01:06:47,970 --> 01:06:49,745
"We'll meet again.."

823
01:06:50,339 --> 01:06:54,947
"..just you and me."

824
01:06:58,547 --> 01:07:01,994
"Hey..hello my friend."

825
01:07:02,785 --> 01:07:04,526
"This is the end.."

826
01:07:05,187 --> 01:07:08,031
"..come on start"

827
01:07:13,562 --> 01:07:17,339
"Hey. .where are you
going. sweetheart."

828
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:25,412
"Know there's no, no, no, no way out."

829
01:07:25,474 --> 01:07:30,184
"You made me..realize.."

830
01:07:30,246 --> 01:07:35,320
"..living here is impossible."

831
01:07:35,384 --> 01:07:40,231
"You made me..realize.."

832
01:07:40,456 --> 01:07:44,370
"..dying here is impossible."

833
01:07:44,427 --> 01:07:46,270
"Give me more.."

834
01:07:47,930 --> 01:07:50,342
"What is life?"

835
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:52,572
"What is death?" - Sam.

836
01:07:52,968 --> 01:07:57,212
"Who knowssweethean."

837
01:07:58,207 --> 01:07:59,447
"Are you alive.."

838
01:08:00,276 --> 01:08:01,949
"..or are you dead?"

839
01:08:02,878 --> 01:08:08,521
"Who knowssweethean."

840
01:08:08,918 --> 01:08:12,923
"You made me..realize.."

841
01:08:13,189 --> 01:08:18,036
"..living here is impossible."

842
01:08:18,094 --> 01:08:22,873
"You made me..realize.."

843
01:08:23,065 --> 01:08:27,241
"..dying here is impossible."

844
01:08:27,303 --> 01:08:28,680
"Give me more.."

845
01:08:28,904 --> 01:08:30,315
"Love.."

846
01:08:30,606 --> 01:08:33,246
"Love.."

847
01:08:41,217 --> 01:08:46,189
"I keep shattering..in
every jamboree."

848
01:08:46,255 --> 01:08:48,758
"Come to me.."

849
01:08:48,958 --> 01:08:50,995
"Come to me.."

850
01:08:51,060 --> 01:08:56,772
"I keep suffering..every moment."

851
01:08:56,832 --> 01:08:58,743
"Come to me.."

852
01:08:58,934 --> 01:09:01,244
"Come to me.."

853
01:09:01,303 --> 01:09:06,184
"Even my shadows
afraid of the mirror."

854
01:09:06,242 --> 01:09:11,282
"What did I achieve..by
losing everything?"

855
01:09:11,347 --> 01:09:15,762
"O shameless."

856
01:09:16,318 --> 01:09:19,527
"Hey..now that you're here.."

857
01:09:20,322 --> 01:09:22,495
"Stay for a while."

858
01:09:22,958 --> 01:09:28,169
"Know there's no, no, no, no way out."

859
01:09:28,297 --> 01:09:32,905
"You made me..realize.."

860
01:09:33,202 --> 01:09:38,242
"..living here is impossible."

861
01:09:38,307 --> 01:09:42,881
"You made me..realize.."

862
01:09:43,045 --> 01:09:47,289
"..dying here is impossible."

863
01:09:47,349 --> 01:09:49,260
"Give me more.."

864
01:09:52,021 --> 01:09:54,262
Finished with your ride.
We're at Alisha's home now.

865
01:09:55,191 --> 01:09:57,569
Can we go now?
- Not so soon, Sammy boy.

866
01:10:00,863 --> 01:10:02,171
Please, let's go.

867
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:04,507
I don't know what we're doing here.

868
01:10:04,900 --> 01:10:07,813
Don't worry, I found out.
Mad bull is out of town.

869
01:10:07,970 --> 01:10:09,313
Let's go. Let's go.

870
01:10:11,307 --> 01:10:12,377
Listen.

871
01:10:14,043 --> 01:10:15,613
"Give me more.."

872
01:10:15,844 --> 01:10:17,255
Are you f*** out of your mind?

873
01:10:17,313 --> 01:10:19,350
"Give me more..love"

874
01:10:19,415 --> 01:10:21,361
"Give me more..love"

875
01:10:24,353 --> 01:10:26,594
"Give me more..love"

876
01:10:26,989 --> 01:10:28,900
"Give me more..love"

877
01:10:29,425 --> 01:10:31,336
"Give me more..love"

878
01:10:31,393 --> 01:10:35,000
"Hey..hello my friend."

879
01:10:35,531 --> 01:10:37,374
"We'll meet again.."

880
01:10:45,708 --> 01:10:47,483
She's sleeping here.

881
01:10:51,213 --> 01:10:56,094
8*" Sam, he really hit her bad.
Shame on you.

882
01:10:56,318 --> 01:10:58,298
What are we doing here?
Let's go from here.

883
01:10:58,587 --> 01:11:01,261
Okay, fine.
At least listen to my Love Game.

884
01:11:02,658 --> 01:11:03,796
I was thinking.

885
01:11:05,527 --> 01:11:07,438
...let's do it here. On the carpet.

886
01:11:08,063 --> 01:11:09,599
What's wrong with you?

887
01:11:09,798 --> 01:11:10,799
Rules are simple.

888
01:11:11,333 --> 01:11:14,246
If she gets up, you'll be in trouble.

889
01:11:15,537 --> 01:11:17,039
Isn't this exciting?

890
01:11:17,206 --> 01:11:19,243
Ramona, I am doing what you said.

891
01:11:20,009 --> 01:11:21,215
So why all this?

892
01:11:23,312 --> 01:11:28,159
Sam. You must pay
the price for leaving me.

893
01:12:21,470 --> 01:12:22,847
Sam, look at me.

894
01:12:26,809 --> 01:12:29,289
What's the matter?
Did something happen?

895
01:12:29,745 --> 01:12:31,554
Tell me, just don't scare me.

896
01:12:33,449 --> 01:12:34,792
There's something I want to tell you.

897
01:12:38,754 --> 01:12:40,165
I hid something from you.

898
01:12:40,856 --> 01:12:41,891
What is it, Sam?

899
01:12:42,958 --> 01:12:44,460
Have you read this
book called 'Love Games'?

900
01:12:45,527 --> 01:12:46,437
No.

901
01:12:55,571 --> 01:12:57,847
"Dark Lies."

902
01:12:58,040 --> 01:12:59,951
"Brave ties."

903
01:13:00,242 --> 01:13:02,051
"Soul cries."

904
01:13:03,145 --> 01:13:05,022
This is so much fun.

905
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:08,926
"Relieve..love grief's."

906
01:13:09,284 --> 01:13:11,355
"Oh please.."

907
01:13:12,588 --> 01:13:15,194
"Ya..this is when I say."

908
01:13:15,424 --> 01:13:19,804
"You brought the poison."

909
01:13:20,396 --> 01:13:24,105
"Your black head's easy to see."

910
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:28,815
"You brought the poison."

911
01:13:29,338 --> 01:13:34,412
"For killing me."

912
01:13:41,984 --> 01:13:44,521
He'! GUYS,
someone spiked himself in the loo.

913
01:13:45,154 --> 01:13:47,430
Let's forget it, let's go.

914
01:13:49,825 --> 01:13:50,826
Let's go.

915
01:13:55,964 --> 01:13:57,238
Ramona baby.

916
01:14:00,369 --> 01:14:03,373
I told Alisha everything, baby.
Everything.

917
01:14:05,274 --> 01:14:09,154
And you know what..she
doesn't want to see my face.

918
01:14:09,311 --> 01:14:10,984
It's all over.

919
01:14:11,914 --> 01:14:13,484
It's all over, baby.

920
01:14:15,150 --> 01:14:17,357
She doesn't want to see my face.

921
01:14:17,519 --> 01:14:18,930
That's how hum she is.

922
01:14:20,322 --> 01:14:22,268
But you know what, you've lost.

923
01:14:24,493 --> 01:14:27,474
I won!
You can't blackmail me again.

924
01:14:28,664 --> 01:14:32,373
Finito! It's all over, baby.

925
01:14:33,435 --> 01:14:35,676
"You brought the poison."

926
01:14:36,104 --> 01:14:39,176
"Your black head's easy to see."

927
01:15:03,832 --> 01:15:05,539
'Who is he? Who is he?'

928
01:15:09,838 --> 01:15:10,782
'I am hurting you.'

929
01:15:29,224 --> 01:15:31,170
'You're my sole support.'

930
01:15:33,328 --> 01:15:35,137
'Don't ever break my heart Sam.'

931
01:15:37,633 --> 01:15:39,237
'Don't ever break my heart Sam.'

932
01:15:44,339 --> 01:15:45,215
Coming.

933
01:16:03,892 --> 01:16:04,870
Come in.

934
01:16:06,528 --> 01:16:07,836
Tea/coffee?

935
01:16:10,866 --> 01:16:11,936
Can you play this?

936
01:16:13,402 --> 01:16:15,541
Are you going to
watch a film together?

937
01:16:32,821 --> 01:16:34,300
Where did you get this footage?

938
01:16:34,489 --> 01:16:36,901
The benefits of being
a top lawyer's wife.

939
01:16:37,125 --> 01:16:39,537
...is that some police
officers know you really well.

940
01:16:41,763 --> 01:16:42,468
Excuse me!

941
01:16:48,937 --> 01:16:53,977
11 :15..Ramona Raichand leaves
her penthouse to attend a party.

942
01:16:55,043 --> 01:16:56,021
And here..

943
01:17:01,116 --> 01:17:02,493
She returns at 2:35am.

944
01:17:03,051 --> 01:17:04,428
What rubbish? Who is she?

945
01:17:05,787 --> 01:17:07,357
If the police were fashion police.

946
01:17:07,422 --> 01:17:09,368
...then they would've certainly
noticed this handbag.

947
01:17:09,891 --> 01:17:12,462
Gucci..2015 summer collection.

948
01:17:12,961 --> 01:17:15,168
Which Ramona's holding, and..

949
01:17:15,364 --> 01:17:19,107
Just a second..even this girl.

950
01:17:21,303 --> 01:17:25,183
Don't forget to notice the
teddy bear and silver trinkets.

951
01:17:28,043 --> 01:17:35,052
Then this girl..leaves 5
minutes after Om Raichand falls.

952
01:17:35,984 --> 01:17:40,091
And here,
she returns as Ramona Raichand again.

953
01:17:43,225 --> 01:17:44,499
Very, very smart.

954
01:17:51,566 --> 01:17:53,204
This doesn't prove anything.

955
01:17:53,435 --> 01:17:55,415
Anyone can have this bag.

956
01:17:55,637 --> 01:17:58,948
Only the police can tell
what can be proven, and whatnot.

957
01:18:00,842 --> 01:18:03,948
Face it Ramona,
you killed your husband.

958
01:18:13,355 --> 01:18:17,462
I'm thinking, if you wanted
to turn me over to the police.

959
01:18:18,160 --> 01:18:19,867
"Then, you would've done it by now.

960
01:18:21,063 --> 01:18:22,906
So what the hell do you want?

961
01:18:23,165 --> 01:18:25,645
My husband only inflicted
wounds on my body.

962
01:18:26,501 --> 01:18:30,415
But the wounds that Sam gave me,
will never heal.

963
01:18:31,139 --> 01:18:35,849
I mean, you and Sam..in my bedroom,
while I was sleeping.

964
01:18:38,113 --> 01:18:39,183
It's unforgivable.

965
01:18:42,918 --> 01:18:44,989
Enough. I've endured enough.

966
01:18:46,655 --> 01:18:48,100
I can't tolerate anymore.

967
01:18:49,591 --> 01:18:52,902
No one can take advantage of
my <i>weakness</i> or helplessness anymore.

968
01:18:53,595 --> 01:18:56,166
So? - And so I want to kill them both?

969
01:18:57,499 --> 01:18:58,273
What?

970
01:18:58,433 --> 01:19:01,209
Sam and Gaurav, I want to kill them.

971
01:19:01,970 --> 01:19:03,005
They must die.

972
01:19:17,552 --> 01:19:20,396
Dude, you're a bigger b*** than I am.

973
01:19:21,523 --> 01:19:24,231
Respect, I've loads of respect.

974
01:19:28,396 --> 01:19:30,398
If you want to kill them, then do it.

975
01:19:30,532 --> 01:19:32,478
Why come to me?

976
01:19:36,538 --> 01:19:38,643
Because I want to
play Love Games as well.

977
01:19:39,908 --> 01:19:41,717
Wow! What do you mean?

978
01:19:41,943 --> 01:19:44,583
I mean..no one knows
that you know my husband.

979
01:19:46,114 --> 01:19:48,424
And no one knows that I know Sam.

980
01:19:49,117 --> 01:19:54,260
So the game is..you kill my husband,
and I will kill Sam.

981
01:19:55,056 --> 01:19:58,230
And whoever gets caught, loses.

982
01:19:59,227 --> 01:20:00,399
Are you like serious?

983
01:20:00,462 --> 01:20:02,066
Do I look like I am joking?

984
01:20:02,430 --> 01:20:04,967
But this can be a trick?

985
01:20:05,567 --> 01:20:08,514
Or maybe Sam and you
are planning something?

986
01:20:14,042 --> 01:20:15,214
Hear it.

987
01:20:17,546 --> 01:20:21,050
"And so I want to kill them both.
- What?"

988
01:20:21,616 --> 01:20:24,654
"I want to kill Sam and Gaurav."

989
01:20:25,220 --> 01:20:26,290
"They must die."

990
01:20:27,589 --> 01:20:29,227
This is your insurance.

991
01:20:30,292 --> 01:20:32,465
If I double-cross you,
then this is your evidence.

992
01:20:32,527 --> 01:20:34,598
...to prove that I am
a pan of this plan too.

993
01:20:35,430 --> 01:20:38,570
Such a big criminal mind
behind this innocent face.

994
01:20:39,134 --> 01:20:40,579
I never imagined.

995
01:20:41,136 --> 01:20:43,241
Hell hath no fury
like a woman's scorn.

996
01:20:43,438 --> 01:20:46,942
Please. I am really bad at
this Shakespeare type of English.

997
01:20:47,008 --> 01:20:48,578
But you're very good at murder.

998
01:20:50,478 --> 01:20:52,515
We'll meet two days
later at your penthouse.

999
01:20:53,315 --> 01:20:55,522
And if none of us get caught.

1000
01:20:56,017 --> 01:20:57,462
"Then we'll open
a bottle of champagne.

1001
01:20:58,253 --> 01:20:59,254
Deal?

1002
01:21:04,693 --> 01:21:06,695
Poor Sam's going to die.

1003
01:21:08,063 --> 01:21:09,474
Dad, I've been thinking.

1004
01:21:10,465 --> 01:21:12,308
Last week at the board
meeting you were saying.

1005
01:21:12,367 --> 01:21:14,210
...that you need someone
to run the London office.

1006
01:21:15,003 --> 01:21:16,539
In order for business to grow.

1007
01:21:17,205 --> 01:21:18,013
Yes.

1008
01:21:24,746 --> 01:21:27,283
Any idea? Who can do it?

1009
01:21:28,116 --> 01:21:31,290
Sameer Saxena. CEO, London office.

1010
01:21:33,755 --> 01:21:35,257
Thank you so much, dad.

1011
01:21:36,358 --> 01:21:38,201
Thank you so much.

1012
01:21:46,968 --> 01:21:49,505
Hello. - Sam. It's me, Alisha.

1013
01:21:49,738 --> 01:21:51,012
Can you come home?

1014
01:21:52,274 --> 01:21:53,753
Okay, but Gaurav?

1015
01:21:54,209 --> 01:21:55,210
Gaurav is not at home.

1016
01:22:04,786 --> 01:22:06,697
You didn't call after that day.

1017
01:22:07,389 --> 01:22:09,767
That means you did not enjoy at all.

1018
01:22:10,091 --> 01:22:11,502
Or maybe you enjoyed so much.

1019
01:22:11,559 --> 01:22:13,038
...that you thought
you'll get addicted.

1020
01:22:13,094 --> 01:22:14,767
I am here on a single phone..

1021
01:22:15,297 --> 01:22:16,571
...so I hope you have your answer.

1022
01:22:17,165 --> 01:22:18,735
But a girl always likes to hear.

1023
01:22:19,234 --> 01:22:21,771
I am already addicted.

1024
01:22:23,405 --> 01:22:24,475
Liar.

1025
01:23:03,378 --> 01:23:04,789
It's adrenaline.

1026
01:23:05,347 --> 01:23:07,725
The best thing is,
the body produces it.

1027
01:23:08,183 --> 01:23:11,221
So in the post mor-tem it will
look like you had a hear-t attack.

1028
01:23:11,753 --> 01:23:13,357
Gaurav, we have the whole night.

1029
01:23:14,255 --> 01:23:15,928
So take your time and die.

1030
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:21,270
I just can't cross
this level of Candy Crush.

1031
01:23:34,843 --> 01:23:37,323
"Delicious!"

1032
01:23:37,379 --> 01:23:40,917
"Delicious!"

1033
01:24:09,811 --> 01:24:12,052
Who are you? Leave me. leave me.

1034
01:24:17,052 --> 01:24:18,929
Don't move. Don't move.

1035
01:24:21,423 --> 01:24:22,424
Sam!

1036
01:24:22,657 --> 01:24:25,160
You f*** 11*", you wanted to kill me.

1037
01:24:25,226 --> 01:24:26,796
Sam, don't move.

1038
01:24:26,861 --> 01:24:29,671
Didn't you try to kill me with Alisha?

1039
01:24:30,698 --> 01:24:32,837
Tell me. Yes or no?

1040
01:24:33,234 --> 01:24:34,372
Yes or no?

1041
01:24:34,436 --> 01:24:36,916
Yes, yes, yes..but it
was Alisha's plan, not mine.

1042
01:24:36,971 --> 01:24:39,212
She said and you believed her.
- Yes, what else could I do?

1043
01:24:39,274 --> 01:24:40,947
She had evidence that
I killed my husband.

1044
01:24:41,409 --> 01:24:43,787
She blackmailed me.
- And you got blackmailed.

1045
01:24:43,945 --> 01:24:46,425
Hell, yes. I like to f" you,
but I like to live more.

1046
01:24:49,150 --> 01:24:51,687
Sam, just peace out. Alright.
Just chill.

1047
01:24:51,853 --> 01:24:54,993
I will shoot you, I swear.
Just relax, for God's sake.

1048
01:24:59,160 --> 01:25:01,106
Alisha told you this, right.

1049
01:25:01,296 --> 01:25:04,402
That b***
I knew she would double-cross me.

1050
01:25:04,732 --> 01:25:07,975
Alisha didn't double cross you.
- Then what is all this?

1051
01:25:22,016 --> 01:25:23,256
Alisha called me.

1052
01:25:23,785 --> 01:25:24,422
Hello.

1053
01:25:24,486 --> 01:25:26,227
She said she can't live without me.

1054
01:25:27,388 --> 01:25:29,163
She wants to forget everything.

1055
01:25:30,125 --> 01:25:32,435
Then she said Gaurav isn't at home,
so you come home.

1056
01:25:36,197 --> 01:25:37,505
We went to her bedroom.

1057
01:25:38,833 --> 01:25:39,868
And things got a little..

1058
01:25:43,872 --> 01:25:45,283
After that suddenly,
I don't know from where..

1059
01:25:45,340 --> 01:25:46,944
...she attacked me with a knife.

1060
01:25:47,275 --> 01:25:48,879
One inch to the left
and I would be dead.

1061
01:25:50,178 --> 01:25:51,213
I was shocked.

1062
01:25:51,279 --> 01:25:55,022
I pushed her down,
that's when she said..

1063
01:25:55,183 --> 01:25:57,254
If you and Ramona
can play Love Games.

1064
01:25:57,452 --> 01:25:58,988
"Then she and I can play it too.

1065
01:25:59,354 --> 01:26:01,994
She said that you had to kill
her husband, and she had to kill me.

1066
01:26:04,159 --> 01:26:04,500
But.

1067
01:26:04,559 --> 01:26:08,473
You think I am weak, you can do
anything you like, and l.. - Shut up.

1068
01:26:09,097 --> 01:26:09,973
But what?

1069
01:26:10,098 --> 01:26:11,270
You think

1070
01:26:14,135 --> 01:26:17,014
But I killed her. - You what?

1071
01:26:21,276 --> 01:26:22,118
PM'

1072
01:26:24,546 --> 01:26:25,354
PM'

1073
01:26:25,547 --> 01:26:26,548
How can l..

1074
01:26:32,320 --> 01:26:33,264
I killed her.

1075
01:26:34,455 --> 01:26:35,331
I killed her.

1076
01:26:42,197 --> 01:26:44,234
Oh my, God. This is ridiculous.

1077
01:26:44,432 --> 01:26:45,502
What the hell is going on?

1078
01:26:47,368 --> 01:26:49,109
This is hysterical.

1079
01:26:50,972 --> 01:26:53,748
I killed the one
I loved because of you.

1080
01:26:55,076 --> 01:26:57,078
I will pay for it,
but you won't survive either.

1081
01:26:57,245 --> 01:26:59,122
I see, what are you going to do?

1082
01:27:00,782 --> 01:27:03,353
I am going to the police,
I will tell them everything.

1083
01:27:04,185 --> 01:27:06,426
And anyway, the guilt of whatever
I did won't let me live.

1084
01:27:06,854 --> 01:27:09,300
Are you crazy?
You want to go to jail. - Yes, I will.

1085
01:27:09,490 --> 01:27:11,800
Idiot, you're only
thinking about yourself.

1086
01:27:11,859 --> 01:27:13,497
I don't even want to think about you.

1087
01:27:13,861 --> 01:27:16,239
I meant Alisha, not me.

1088
01:27:18,733 --> 01:27:20,542
The one you loved.

1089
01:27:22,170 --> 01:27:23,240
What will you tell the police?

1090
01:27:23,972 --> 01:27:26,009
That you guys were
in a extra marital affair.

1091
01:27:26,274 --> 01:27:27,753
And that led to her murder.

1092
01:27:28,376 --> 01:27:31,482
So that the entire media, along with
the whole world thinks she's a s***.

1093
01:27:34,082 --> 01:27:38,360
Wow, Sam.
What an idea..to repent for your sin.

1094
01:27:39,220 --> 01:27:42,258
Humiliate the one
you want to apologies to.

1095
01:27:43,491 --> 01:27:44,367
Brilliant.

1096
01:27:45,426 --> 01:27:46,564
Go, Sam. Go.

1097
01:27:53,368 --> 01:27:54,904
Its better you kill me.

1098
01:27:54,969 --> 01:27:57,313
Kill me. Kill me, please.

1099
01:27:58,072 --> 01:28:01,076
Why should I kill you?
You kill yourself.

1100
01:28:01,376 --> 01:28:03,219
Go ahead, take your life.

1101
01:28:17,058 --> 01:28:18,537
Alisha!

1102
01:28:21,863 --> 01:28:23,274
Alisha!

1103
01:28:35,243 --> 01:28:37,314
This is called running out of oxygen.

1104
01:28:38,179 --> 01:28:40,181
I said you were scuba diving.

1105
01:28:40,515 --> 01:28:41,391
Now suffer.

1106
01:28:42,350 --> 01:28:44,455
It's easy to talk
about going to jail..

1107
01:28:45,119 --> 01:28:46,564
"But actually going
to jail is difficult.

1108
01:28:47,455 --> 01:28:48,263
Help me.

1109
01:28:49,290 --> 01:28:50,166
Please.

1110
01:28:53,461 --> 01:28:55,168
Of course I will help you.

1111
01:28:55,663 --> 01:28:57,404
But I have a condition.

1112
01:28:58,166 --> 01:28:59,543
I win this love game.

1113
01:29:00,935 --> 01:29:04,178
Whenever I call you, you must come.

1114
01:29:05,206 --> 01:29:08,312
You will remain my f*** buddy, agreed?

1115
01:29:10,211 --> 01:29:10,985
Fine.

1116
01:29:13,514 --> 01:29:16,154
First let's get rid of Alisha's body.

1117
01:29:18,486 --> 01:29:19,328
Let's go.

1118
01:29:30,131 --> 01:29:32,634
Oh my, God!

1119
01:29:39,173 --> 01:29:40,618
How did the police find out?

1120
01:29:42,377 --> 01:29:43,378
When I came here?

1121
01:29:49,317 --> 01:29:50,227
Look, there.

1122
01:29:51,052 --> 01:29:53,191
That's the one, right.
Talking to the police?

1123
01:29:54,489 --> 01:29:55,490
Yes, that's her.

1124
01:30:00,061 --> 01:30:00,971
Poor thing.

1125
01:30:11,139 --> 01:30:12,584
I don't think we
can get away with this.

1126
01:30:13,341 --> 01:30:15,480
I should surrender before
the police arrests me.

1127
01:30:15,743 --> 01:30:18,121
Oh, God! Just relax you jittery pants.

1128
01:30:18,246 --> 01:30:19,281
Just relax, okay.

1129
01:30:19,981 --> 01:30:20,755
Sam, chill.

1130
01:30:21,516 --> 01:30:22,358
Sam.

1131
01:30:24,585 --> 01:30:26,121
We're both 8cm'

1132
01:30:29,123 --> 01:30:32,127
Hold. Don't think like think.

1133
01:30:33,094 --> 01:30:37,406
Think like it's a Love Game.
What would you do then?

1134
01:30:37,598 --> 01:30:41,068
You and I are playing a Love Game,
with the Police.

1135
01:30:41,569 --> 01:30:42,673
Think like that.

1136
01:31:00,521 --> 01:31:01,431
There's one way.

1137
01:31:02,824 --> 01:31:03,325
What?

1138
01:31:03,891 --> 01:31:08,271
If we can do something to
prove that Gaurav killed Alisha.

1139
01:31:08,996 --> 01:31:10,031
And then killed himself.

1140
01:31:11,132 --> 01:31:13,305
Everyone knows that things
weren't right between them.

1141
01:31:13,835 --> 01:31:16,213
And that day at the party,
he insulted her in front of everyone.

1142
01:31:17,638 --> 01:31:20,084
I think the Police will agree,
what do you think?

1143
01:31:20,274 --> 01:31:23,153
Nice idea. But Gaurav is already dead.

1144
01:31:23,377 --> 01:31:25,653
How will the police
believe that he killed her?

1145
01:31:25,880 --> 01:31:27,257
I'll have to pose as Gaurav.

1146
01:31:28,282 --> 01:31:31,195
I'll wear Gaurav's clothes,
and keep his purse.

1147
01:31:31,285 --> 01:31:32,389
For identification.

1148
01:31:33,054 --> 01:31:35,159
This is Gaurav's phone,
where do I keep it? - Here.

1149
01:31:42,430 --> 01:31:47,209
Then we'll go to the morgue,
and steal Alisha's body.

1150
01:31:47,902 --> 01:31:49,904
So that when the police
checks the CCTV footage.

1151
01:31:50,137 --> 01:31:52,481
"They will think that
Gaurav stole Alisha's body..

1152
01:31:52,540 --> 01:31:54,213
...so that they can't
perform a postmortem.

1153
01:31:54,442 --> 01:31:56,251
Only a murderer will
do such a thing, right?

1154
01:31:56,377 --> 01:31:57,253
What do you think?

1155
01:31:59,380 --> 01:32:01,360
I knew you were my Sherlock Holmes.

1156
01:32:33,147 --> 01:32:34,319
Holy mow--.

1157
01:32:39,487 --> 01:32:42,991
Sam, you're like so dead.
Like D E A D.

1158
01:32:43,057 --> 01:32:45,196
Oh, God, this is exciting.

1159
01:32:45,393 --> 01:32:47,339
"Exciting."

1160
01:32:48,496 --> 01:32:50,942
"Exciting."

1161
01:32:52,066 --> 01:32:54,068
"Exciting."

1162
01:32:57,505 --> 01:32:58,540
Boss.

1163
01:32:59,874 --> 01:33:01,148
Which department?

1164
01:33:01,676 --> 01:33:03,280
General ward.

1165
01:33:06,514 --> 01:33:07,652
The phone's dead.

1166
01:33:08,683 --> 01:33:11,562
You can go in when I get a message.

1167
01:33:12,553 --> 01:33:13,964
I am not your servant.

1168
01:33:14,021 --> 01:33:16,331
You'll watch a film,
and I'll stand guard.

1169
01:33:16,691 --> 01:33:17,635
Put it in yourself.

1170
01:33:17,692 --> 01:33:21,469
Wait. Don't get angry.
Make a entry and put it in.

1171
01:33:57,064 --> 01:33:57,804
Greetings, sir.

1172
01:33:57,865 --> 01:33:59,538
That murder case lady,
where's the body?

1173
01:34:00,001 --> 01:34:01,309
Come, sir. Come.

1174
01:34:10,144 --> 01:34:12,954
Joking with me?
- No, sir, this was the door.

1175
01:34:13,014 --> 01:34:16,461
This..how did she
turn into a man? - l..l..

1176
01:34:16,784 --> 01:34:17,819
Did someone come here?

1177
01:34:18,252 --> 01:34:20,528
Yes, a ward-boy did
come here with a dead body.

1178
01:34:42,910 --> 01:34:44,389
Good boy, Sammy.

1179
01:34:55,322 --> 01:34:56,596
<i>Oh 3,.“</i>

1180
01:34:59,160 --> 01:35:00,571
Sammy! Sammy! Sammy!

1181
01:35:03,864 --> 01:35:05,935
Come on, star-t the car.
Sammy, star-t the car.

1182
01:35:23,617 --> 01:35:24,493
Sam.

1183
01:35:25,853 --> 01:35:26,661
Sam.

1184
01:35:27,321 --> 01:35:28,925
You know why I lust you?

1185
01:35:29,356 --> 01:35:31,495
You've got beauty with brains.

1186
01:35:32,259 --> 01:35:35,570
What a great idea of burying
the body in the grave yard.

1187
01:35:36,430 --> 01:35:39,240
Another dead body
amongst so many bodies.

1188
01:35:39,467 --> 01:35:42,971
But unfortunately, late Gaurav
Asthana will take the credit.

1189
01:35:43,137 --> 01:35:46,949
He hid his wife's body so well.
It can never be found.

1190
01:35:50,578 --> 01:35:54,355
Yo, Sam. Don't forget
that she tried to kill you..

1191
01:35:54,415 --> 01:35:56,486
...and you killed her in self-defense.

1192
01:35:57,351 --> 01:35:59,262
So you can sing your
sad song once you're home.

1193
01:35:59,320 --> 01:36:02,324
Okay, baby. Let's go, let's go.
It will be morning soon.

1194
01:36:02,590 --> 01:36:05,093
Sam, let's go.

1195
01:36:37,458 --> 01:36:39,961
You know Sammy,
sun-bathing with the dead body..

1196
01:36:40,027 --> 01:36:42,871
...reminds me of my marriage.

1197
01:36:43,798 --> 01:36:44,868
Get it.

1198
01:36:47,935 --> 01:36:50,814
Hey queen, help me push the car.

1199
01:36:51,639 --> 01:36:53,585
What the hell..

1200
01:37:29,143 --> 01:37:30,918
Remember your promise, right.

1201
01:37:33,581 --> 01:37:37,358
I'll give you one day,
to weep for your girlfriend.

1202
01:37:37,985 --> 01:37:39,828
There's a party at
the Chopra's tomorrow.

1203
01:37:40,254 --> 01:37:41,961
We play Love Games, right?

1204
01:37:43,057 --> 01:37:45,936
Right? - Yeah, right.

1205
01:37:49,330 --> 01:37:52,004
You're not trying to pull
something out here, are you?

1206
01:37:52,333 --> 01:37:53,107
What do you mean?

1207
01:37:54,268 --> 01:37:57,613
I mean I hope you're not
trying to betray me and run away

1208
01:37:59,506 --> 01:38:01,508
Where will I go?
Where would I go?

1209
01:38:04,111 --> 01:38:05,146
Good boy.

1210
01:38:06,580 --> 01:38:11,120
"You lie..He's going to fly away."

1211
01:38:13,220 --> 01:38:15,962
Alisha Asthana's murder
case is getting solved with time.

1212
01:38:16,523 --> 01:38:18,935
The police has said to
the media in their statement..

1213
01:38:18,993 --> 01:38:22,133
...that Alisha Asthana was murdered
by her husband Gaurav Asthana.

1214
01:38:22,830 --> 01:38:26,073
The police believes that
as a top criminal lawyer..

1215
01:38:26,233 --> 01:38:29,339
...he knew that Alisha
Asthana's postmortem report..

1216
01:38:29,403 --> 01:38:32,145
...would've proven his crime.

1217
01:38:32,306 --> 01:38:35,150
CCTV footage proves
that Gaurav Asthana.

1218
01:38:35,209 --> 01:38:38,383
...came to the hospital
late night in his car.

1219
01:38:38,445 --> 01:38:40,584
And his clothes were
recovered from the morgue.

1220
01:38:40,881 --> 01:38:42,588
I was heading towards the
general ward with the stretcher.

1221
01:38:42,950 --> 01:38:44,896
I wonder where he came from,
and rendered me unconscious.

1222
01:38:45,853 --> 01:38:48,299
Gaurav Asthana's body and his car..

1223
01:38:48,355 --> 01:38:50,426
...was recovered from a ravine today.

1224
01:38:50,591 --> 01:38:53,071
Gaurav was wearing the clothes of..

1225
01:38:53,127 --> 01:38:55,368
...the ward boy from the
Mumbai Memorial Hospital.

1226
01:38:55,562 --> 01:38:58,202
But the biggest question is..

1227
01:38:58,265 --> 01:39:01,974
...where did Gaurav hide
Alisha Asthana's body?

1228
01:39:02,036 --> 01:39:04,175
What time's your flight? - Tonight.

1229
01:39:04,238 --> 01:39:05,273
You're just leaving like this.

1230
01:39:05,539 --> 01:39:07,075
No farewell party, no nothing.

1231
01:39:07,274 --> 01:39:10,653
Consider that..l want to
leave without telling anyone.

1232
01:39:10,945 --> 01:39:11,923
Quietly.

1233
01:39:34,068 --> 01:39:36,810
If you don't mind,
I'll just be back. - Okay.

1234
01:39:36,870 --> 01:39:38,281
Just a moment. - Okay.

1235
01:39:41,875 --> 01:39:43,786
Welcome to British Airways.

1236
01:39:43,844 --> 01:39:47,348
Flight no.
BAB775 from Mumbai to London..

1237
01:39:47,414 --> 01:39:49,416
...will depart on time.

1238
01:39:57,558 --> 01:39:59,538
I'll go get the wine, it's in the car

1239
01:39:59,760 --> 01:40:02,001
Hey..we don't need it.

1240
01:40:02,062 --> 01:40:03,769
Believe me, we do.

1241
01:40:28,956 --> 01:40:31,960
Sam..you're running away from me.

1242
01:40:32,393 --> 01:40:33,269
PM'

1243
01:41:00,487 --> 01:41:02,296
What the hell.

1244
01:41:12,166 --> 01:41:14,510
Gaurav and you taught us one thing.

1245
01:41:14,935 --> 01:41:16,209
The world is a jungle..

1246
01:41:16,336 --> 01:41:19,613
...and the best player rules.

1247
01:41:20,140 --> 01:41:21,744
Survival of the most cunning.

1248
01:41:22,242 --> 01:41:25,655
Fair means if possible.
And foul means if necessary.

1249
01:41:26,213 --> 01:41:27,157
Ramona, baby.

1250
01:41:27,581 --> 01:41:30,118
Those times are gone
when lovers die here..

1251
01:41:30,184 --> 01:41:31,629
...and try to meet in heaven.

1252
01:41:32,586 --> 01:41:35,192
This time..lovers will
kill others in their way..

1253
01:41:35,322 --> 01:41:37,632
...and stay here themselves.

1254
01:41:38,692 --> 01:41:41,002
The need for two
lovers to be together.

1255
01:41:41,061 --> 01:41:42,768
...is much more than two f****

1256
01:41:43,597 --> 01:41:48,410
So I win this Love Game,
I guess you ran out of oxygen.

1257
01:41:55,509 --> 01:41:58,183
The biggest benefit of being dead..

1258
01:42:01,215 --> 01:42:03,593
...is that I will never
be accused of murder.

1259
01:42:14,161 --> 01:42:16,266
<i>Oh 3,.“</i>

1260
01:42:17,464 --> 01:42:18,374
Oh my, God!

1261
01:42:18,565 --> 01:42:22,274
"Nirvana!"

1262
01:42:28,075 --> 01:42:29,452
Hello. - It's done.

1263
01:42:34,047 --> 01:42:35,526
"Nirvana!"

1264
01:42:35,582 --> 01:42:36,788
What's wrong, Sam?

1265
01:42:37,184 --> 01:42:38,595
Have you read this
book called Love Games?

1266
01:42:38,652 --> 01:42:42,099
I love you, Sam. I don't care
about Love Games and all this s***.

1267
01:42:42,456 --> 01:42:46,097
Honestly speaking, I am scared
that someday Gaurav will kill me.

1268
01:42:46,460 --> 01:42:47,666
Ramona is no less.

1269
01:42:47,728 --> 01:42:51,574
It's quite simple,
it's either her or us.

1270
01:42:51,632 --> 01:42:53,839
Are you crazy, Sam?
I am a doctor, not a murderer.

1271
01:42:54,067 --> 01:42:57,207
But we have to do us. Before
they kill us, we must kill them.

1272
01:43:05,913 --> 01:43:06,948
You're right, Sam.

1273
01:43:08,415 --> 01:43:10,520
That's the only way
to get out of this hell.

1274
01:43:18,492 --> 01:43:19,562
I was right.

1275
01:43:19,993 --> 01:43:21,495
Look, Ramona's handbag.

1276
01:43:22,396 --> 01:43:24,205
And look at this.

1277
01:43:25,232 --> 01:43:26,233
This is brilliant.

1278
01:43:26,300 --> 01:43:28,678
We've got a sure
way to blackmail Ramona.

1279
01:43:33,407 --> 01:43:35,546
These are some credit cards,
and your new passport

1280
01:43:35,609 --> 01:43:37,145
I've used all my influence this time.

1281
01:43:37,311 --> 01:43:40,019
Your new name is
Riya Rao from Bengaluru.

1282
01:43:40,214 --> 01:43:42,660
"Nirvana!"

1283
01:43:55,128 --> 01:43:57,267
This is Tetrodotoxin.
It's a neurotoxin.

1284
01:43:57,331 --> 01:43:59,470
If I take this,
my hear-t beat will get really low.

1285
01:43:59,533 --> 01:44:01,638
And my body will be
in a state of paralysis.

1286
01:44:02,135 --> 01:44:03,978
Anyone will think I am dead.

1287
01:44:04,037 --> 01:44:06,574
Are you sure this works?
- Of course, I am a surgeon.

1288
01:44:07,307 --> 01:44:08,183
Right.

1289
01:44:13,580 --> 01:44:16,459
Hello. - Sam, it's me Alisha.

1290
01:44:16,583 --> 01:44:17,584
Can you come home?

1291
01:44:19,152 --> 01:44:20,756
Okay, but Gaurav.

1292
01:44:22,990 --> 01:44:23,730
Hi.

1293
01:44:24,291 --> 01:44:25,531
How did the police find out?

1294
01:44:25,759 --> 01:44:27,568
How will the police
find out you're dead?

1295
01:44:27,728 --> 01:44:29,799
Don't worry,
my maid comes here every evening.

1296
01:44:30,030 --> 01:44:31,407
She will see me dead.

1297
01:44:31,598 --> 01:44:35,205
In that case, I must lie
to Ramona that the maid saw me.

1298
01:44:35,369 --> 01:44:39,340
And she will tell the police
that the maid saw you dead. - Correct.

1299
01:44:42,709 --> 01:44:43,813
Don't worry, Sam.

1300
01:44:44,044 --> 01:44:46,752
My blood group and this blood
from the blood bank are same.

1301
01:44:46,813 --> 01:44:48,759
After you leave, I will take this.

1302
01:44:48,815 --> 01:44:53,764
If you don't save me in 10 hours,
then I'll actually get post-modem.

1303
01:45:07,634 --> 01:45:10,444
You endured all this
for so long, dear.

1304
01:45:10,671 --> 01:45:12,617
And never told us anything.

1305
01:45:12,673 --> 01:45:15,483
I just need one help from you.

1306
01:45:18,512 --> 01:45:19,456
Come on.

1307
01:45:56,416 --> 01:45:58,327
"Roses are red, violets are blue."

1308
01:45:58,385 --> 01:46:00,729
"Sex can be messy,
but love can be true."

1309
01:46:04,558 --> 01:46:06,663
So friends, get the drift.

1310
01:46:07,127 --> 01:46:08,401
See how it's done.

1311
01:46:08,562 --> 01:46:11,805
Kill the badam and fly into the sun.

1312
01:46:12,299 --> 01:46:15,803
Fly into the sun!

1313
01:46:18,305 --> 01:46:19,249
0K8'!-

1314
01:46:29,883 --> 01:46:35,356
"There's nothing
I can ask your God for."

1315
01:46:35,589 --> 01:46:40,868
"I got everything I wanted."

1316
01:46:41,361 --> 01:46:46,743
"I never belonged to anyone,
nor was anyone mine."

1317
01:46:47,367 --> 01:46:52,874
"But since I found you. I found God."

1318
01:46:53,473 --> 01:46:59,116
"You dwell in every element,
and in every star."

1319
01:46:59,179 --> 01:47:04,788
"You exist in every grain,
and in every drop."

1320
01:47:04,851 --> 01:47:07,593
"You exist in both worlds."

1321
01:47:07,654 --> 01:47:10,430
"You're on earth and in the sky."

1322
01:47:10,490 --> 01:47:18,204
"You're my heaven, you're my love."

1323
01:47:18,865 --> 01:47:23,780
"Just you.."

1324
01:47:26,840 --> 01:47:32,222
"There's nothing
I can ask your God for."

1325
01:47:32,579 --> 01:47:38,621
"I got everything I wanted."

1326
01:47:38,952 --> 01:47:44,595
"You dwell in every element,
and in every star."

1327
01:47:44,658 --> 01:47:50,370
"You exist in every grain,
and in every drop."

1328
01:47:50,430 --> 01:47:53,240
"You exist in both worlds."

1329
01:47:53,300 --> 01:47:55,906
"You're on earth and in the sky."

1330
01:47:55,969 --> 01:48:04,184
"You're my heaven, you're my love."

1331
01:48:04,411 --> 01:48:09,952
"Just you.."
