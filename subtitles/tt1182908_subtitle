00:00:55,736 --> 00:00:59,900
Krazzy 4!

3
00:01:28,902 --> 00:01:30,767
Today's meeting start here.

4
00:01:30,837 --> 00:01:32,771
Sir, you tell,
you were telling something.

5
00:01:32,839 --> 00:01:34,830
'We want to put forward
a motion of peace.'

6
00:01:34,908 --> 00:01:37,274
'Your words cause the
most disturbance.'

7
00:01:37,511 --> 00:01:39,775
'We do not believe what you say!'

8
00:01:42,249 --> 00:01:44,217
'Please maintain silence.'

9
00:01:44,951 --> 00:01:46,441
'Do not make noise.'

10
00:01:46,987 --> 00:01:51,014
'That was the world in which
sane people live.'

11
00:01:51,792 --> 00:01:55,785
'And this is the world in
which those people live..

12
00:01:55,862 --> 00:01:58,194
..whom sane people call insane.'

13
00:02:00,801 --> 00:02:05,295
Believe me Mrs. Bharucha, We Care
hospital is not a hospital.

14
00:02:05,539 --> 00:02:09,532
But it is a hospital! My lawyer
told me it is a hospital.

15
00:02:09,876 --> 00:02:11,935
That's why l want
to give a donation.

16
00:02:12,012 --> 00:02:16,813
No, by that l meant, we don't
consider it a hospital..

17
00:02:16,883 --> 00:02:18,976
..but a temple.

18
00:02:19,252 --> 00:02:20,810
The care we provide to
our patients here..

19
00:02:20,887 --> 00:02:24,448
..they will not get in any
other mental hospital.

20
00:02:32,299 --> 00:02:36,099
Dr. Malik, do you know what
happened yesterday?

21
00:02:36,837 --> 00:02:40,568
The cruel Dyer massacred hundreds
in Jalianwala Baugh.

22
00:02:41,575 --> 00:02:45,944
l just spoke to Mahatma Gandhi.
He is very upset.

23
00:02:46,913 --> 00:02:51,179
Tomorrow we have organized a
gathering near the hospital grounds.

24
00:02:51,384 --> 00:02:53,352
Mahatma Gandhi will
be the chief guest.

25
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,854
Nehru, Sardar Patel,
Bal Gangadhar Tilak..

26
00:02:55,922 --> 00:02:57,856
..Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru..

27
00:02:57,924 --> 00:03:01,052
..Tatya Tope will attend
with his grandson.

28
00:03:02,028 --> 00:03:06,089
Bahadur Shah Zafar is unwell so
he won't be able to attend.

29
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:07,960
His poem will be recited.

30
00:03:08,368 --> 00:03:12,327
We will show the British
how strong we are.

31
00:03:12,405 --> 00:03:14,100
Hail motherland!

32
00:03:15,876 --> 00:03:17,138
Hail motherland!

33
00:03:17,611 --> 00:03:20,307
'Gangadhar, a patient
of schizophrenia.'

34
00:03:20,614 --> 00:03:24,050
'For ten years he has been the
pride of this hospital!'

35
00:03:24,885 --> 00:03:28,286
'Even now he thinks the country
has not attained independence.'

36
00:03:28,955 --> 00:03:31,321
'He was writing a book on
the freedom fighters.'

37
00:03:31,892 --> 00:03:35,259
'But before he could complete
the book he went crazy.'

38
00:03:35,896 --> 00:03:37,227
Hail motherland!

39
00:03:59,019 --> 00:04:00,919
Clean clothes are a symbol
of a clean mind and..

40
00:04:00,987 --> 00:04:04,354
..a clean mind is a symbol of
a clean society. ls that clear?

41
00:04:04,925 --> 00:04:07,655
ls that clear?
- Yes, sir! - Okay.

42
00:04:15,936 --> 00:04:16,994
Dabboo!

43
00:04:18,338 --> 00:04:19,396
Dabboo!

44
00:04:20,941 --> 00:04:23,466
'Dabboo, a patient of
selective mutism.'

45
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:26,103
'Nobody knows anything
about his past.'

46
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,674
'He has been here
since he was four.'

47
00:04:29,015 --> 00:04:31,381
'Nobody knows when he spoke last.'

48
00:04:31,685 --> 00:04:34,245
'And nobody can say when
he will speak next.'

49
00:04:36,957 --> 00:04:38,015
What are you doing?

50
00:04:40,026 --> 00:04:41,357
Dabboo! Dabboo!

51
00:04:42,095 --> 00:04:43,687
Dabboo! Dabboo!

52
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:45,122
What are you doing?

53
00:04:45,231 --> 00:04:47,165
Can't you see he is hitting
the dog with a stick?

54
00:04:51,571 --> 00:04:52,697
There's no dog here.

55
00:04:52,973 --> 00:04:54,201
There's no stick either.

56
00:05:05,452 --> 00:05:07,352
Why is there disbalance
in the country?

57
00:05:10,991 --> 00:05:13,551
Dabboo wants to know why
there is disbalance.

58
00:05:13,994 --> 00:05:17,157
Because one person eats food
made for four persons.

59
00:05:17,263 --> 00:05:19,197
And the other three go hungry.

60
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:31,336
lf you throw litter here, there
will be litter everywhere.

61
00:05:32,012 --> 00:05:34,446
lf there is litter everywhere,
the crop will be as good as litter.

62
00:05:34,514 --> 00:05:40,282
lf that happens, we will
have litter for food.

63
00:05:44,758 --> 00:05:46,487
The cleaner is at it again!

64
00:05:47,093 --> 00:05:49,186
Did you work for the
municipality earlier?

65
00:05:49,262 --> 00:05:52,129
Do they really work
in the municipality?

66
00:05:55,635 --> 00:05:57,102
Bad manners! Remove your
feet from the chair.

67
00:05:57,504 --> 00:06:00,166
Why do look at things
in a different way?

68
00:06:00,607 --> 00:06:04,134
Maybe the feet are not on the chair
but the chair is under the feet.

69
00:06:04,244 --> 00:06:06,508
Raja, remove your feet from the
chair or l'll remove the chair.

70
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,238
Just try!
- Okay!

71
00:06:11,651 --> 00:06:12,709
You!

72
00:06:14,287 --> 00:06:15,413
Not here!

73
00:06:15,555 --> 00:06:16,715
You want the chair?

74
00:06:18,124 --> 00:06:19,216
Take it!

75
00:06:19,292 --> 00:06:23,126
Take the chair! - World war
has started! Save us, Netaji!

76
00:06:23,697 --> 00:06:25,392
Save us, Mahatma Gandhi!

77
00:06:25,799 --> 00:06:29,291
'Raja, a patient of intermittent
explosive disorder.'

78
00:06:29,569 --> 00:06:32,402
'He has a volatile temperament.'

79
00:06:32,539 --> 00:06:37,067
'This was known to the umpire
before Raja whose head he broke..

80
00:06:37,143 --> 00:06:40,203
..because he no-balled him.'

81
00:06:47,353 --> 00:06:50,083
l think we have to tell
the hospital management..

82
00:06:50,156 --> 00:06:52,488
..to make the hospital quake-proof.

83
00:06:53,093 --> 00:06:55,084
So that whenever there's
an earthquake again..

84
00:06:55,161 --> 00:06:57,755
..the chairs should not break.
lsn't it, Raja?

85
00:06:59,632 --> 00:07:03,159
Why do you do these things?

86
00:07:05,705 --> 00:07:09,106
l can understand as your medicines
have been discontinued..

87
00:07:09,175 --> 00:07:11,234
..you might be feeling uneasy.

88
00:07:11,311 --> 00:07:12,642
lt's quite normal.

89
00:07:13,446 --> 00:07:16,108
Have l not told you to count
backwards from ten to one..

90
00:07:16,182 --> 00:07:17,615
..whenever you get angry?

91
00:07:18,218 --> 00:07:19,742
Your anger will dissipate.

92
00:07:20,553 --> 00:07:22,180
Sometimes l don't get the chance.

93
00:07:24,124 --> 00:07:25,216
l'm sorry.

94
00:07:34,768 --> 00:07:37,259
Dr. Sonali, are your husband
and daughter okay?

95
00:07:37,871 --> 00:07:40,203
l'd like to check them.
l'm on my rounds.

96
00:07:40,273 --> 00:07:41,331
l am Dr. Mukherjee.

97
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:45,204
He was! A few years ago.
Now you are a patient.

98
00:07:46,713 --> 00:07:48,476
Mr. Mukherjee, remove your coat.

99
00:07:49,149 --> 00:07:52,277
And please don't wear any
doctor's clothes again.

100
00:07:52,585 --> 00:07:54,382
Come on, Please.

101
00:07:56,890 --> 00:08:01,224
'Mukherjee, a patient of obsessive
compulsive personality disorder.'

102
00:08:01,427 --> 00:08:04,157
'He is so obsessed
with cleanliness..

103
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:08,326
..that if you litter anywhere
he'll reduce you to litter.'

104
00:08:12,438 --> 00:08:13,530
Good!

105
00:08:13,706 --> 00:08:17,164
The reason l conduct this
group therapy program..

106
00:08:17,243 --> 00:08:19,507
..is because l want
to see you change.

107
00:08:19,579 --> 00:08:20,705
And the changes are visible.

108
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:22,509
Take Dabboo for instance.

109
00:08:23,183 --> 00:08:26,346
Dabboo couldn't understand
us earlier.

110
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:30,287
But today we know that he
understands everything.

111
00:08:30,523 --> 00:08:31,581
Right, Dabboo?

112
00:08:32,292 --> 00:08:37,195
And the changes will be faster,
when you help each other..

113
00:08:37,263 --> 00:08:39,857
..to overcome your weakness.

114
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,361
Like a team.

115
00:08:42,802 --> 00:08:47,330
That's why l'm taking you for the
lndia-England cricket match.

116
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:50,199
When you watch the
lndian team play..

117
00:08:50,276 --> 00:08:54,542
..you'll understand how the lndian
team plays like a team.

118
00:08:54,681 --> 00:08:57,377
When are we going? We must
inform Mahatma Gandhi.

119
00:08:57,483 --> 00:09:01,214
Tomorrow! On lndependence day
they're playing a match in Mumbai..

120
00:09:01,287 --> 00:09:03,551
..where l want to take you.

121
00:09:04,324 --> 00:09:06,292
Do you realize what you are saying?

122
00:09:06,359 --> 00:09:08,884
Well, personally, l think
Dr. Sonali has lost it.

123
00:09:08,962 --> 00:09:13,399
Taking the 4 of them out for a
match. l simply will not allow it!

124
00:09:14,634 --> 00:09:18,434
Dr. Malik, l want them to reconnect
with the world. - Never!

125
00:09:18,571 --> 00:09:21,540
Raja can kill anyone in anger!

126
00:09:21,975 --> 00:09:28,312
Sonali, l am not against you.
But to take them out..

127
00:09:28,414 --> 00:09:30,245
For fear of falling,
if you don't make..

128
00:09:30,316 --> 00:09:32,750
..a child walk, how will
he learn to walk?

129
00:09:33,887 --> 00:09:38,381
Sir, please trust me. You are more
senior and experienced than me.

130
00:09:38,925 --> 00:09:42,258
You have taught me that we should
treat a psychiatric patient..

131
00:09:42,328 --> 00:09:44,853
..from the heart and not the mind.

132
00:09:45,999 --> 00:09:49,662
And my heart says they
won't let me down.

133
00:10:01,281 --> 00:10:02,407
Good morning!

134
00:10:03,349 --> 00:10:04,611
How do l look?

135
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:13,523
ls this a time to ask?
- We are going for the match!

136
00:10:14,027 --> 00:10:17,690
Why aren't you ready yet? Hurry up!

137
00:10:21,301 --> 00:10:25,795
We have to leave at 7.
lt's 3 in the morning.

138
00:10:26,773 --> 00:10:30,368
That means l got ready too early.

139
00:10:30,977 --> 00:10:33,309
Going out into the world
after so many years..

140
00:10:33,379 --> 00:10:35,438
..in that excitement..

141
00:10:35,648 --> 00:10:38,378
..it was hard to pass the time.
l kept looking at the watch.

142
00:10:38,851 --> 00:10:40,682
l thought it was running slowly.

143
00:10:41,421 --> 00:10:44,390
We have time. Go back to sleep.

144
00:10:45,725 --> 00:10:50,753
When do we leave? At 6? l
think 5 is better. Right?

145
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:53,993
We leave at 7. Now go to sleep.

146
00:10:54,067 --> 00:10:56,331
Don't forget to wake me up?
- All right.

147
00:10:56,402 --> 00:10:57,460
Even Mahatma Gandhi
wouldn't have been..

148
00:10:57,537 --> 00:10:59,334
..so happy on the eve
of independence.

149
00:10:59,405 --> 00:11:01,066
Do wake me up?
- Okay.

150
00:11:11,784 --> 00:11:12,910
Can't sleep?

151
00:11:16,522 --> 00:11:17,614
Me too.

152
00:11:19,425 --> 00:11:20,892
Waiting has its own meaning.

153
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:23,621
When you do it, you hate it.

154
00:11:24,931 --> 00:11:26,694
When someone else does
it, you like it.

155
00:11:32,672 --> 00:11:34,537
No one waits for us.

156
00:11:37,377 --> 00:11:38,969
You and l have a similar story.

157
00:11:40,446 --> 00:11:43,711
l left my loved ones and
your loved ones left you.

158
00:12:07,974 --> 00:12:09,066
Come on!

159
00:12:09,475 --> 00:12:12,603
Mukherjee! Move!
- No, l'm the captain.

160
00:12:12,678 --> 00:12:13,736
l will sit in front.

161
00:12:13,813 --> 00:12:14,871
What is going on?

162
00:12:14,947 --> 00:12:16,414
You don't know how to sit in a car.
- Mr. Mukherjee!

163
00:12:16,482 --> 00:12:17,949
Mr. Gangadhar. What is going on?

164
00:12:18,985 --> 00:12:20,816
Wait! Let me decide.

165
00:12:20,887 --> 00:12:23,754
Mr. Mukherjee, you sit in front now.

166
00:12:25,491 --> 00:12:27,584
Mr. Gangadhar, you sit in
front while returning.

167
00:12:28,161 --> 00:12:29,492
Hail motherland!
- Okay?

168
00:12:40,773 --> 00:12:45,506
Krazzy 4!

169
00:13:06,466 --> 00:13:08,525
Why did you switch off the radio?
- Mukherjee, what is this?

170
00:13:08,601 --> 00:13:13,038
Relax! lt's okay. - Switch on the
radio or else we will revolt.

171
00:13:45,972 --> 00:13:53,174
We have set out, on
this path of life.

172
00:13:53,246 --> 00:14:01,017
Feels like we've found all
the happiness in this world.

173
00:14:42,094 --> 00:14:49,159
What is the cool
breeze whispering?

174
00:14:49,302 --> 00:14:56,765
Maybe there's a new destination
it's taking.

175
00:15:00,646 --> 00:15:07,848
Why do birds sing? Why do
they remember these songs?

176
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:11,583
They sing because they can fly.

177
00:15:11,657 --> 00:15:14,717
They are happy they are free.

178
00:15:14,794 --> 00:15:18,252
We travel through different
paths to different places.

179
00:15:18,331 --> 00:15:22,597
We will travel through different
paths to different places.

180
00:15:22,702 --> 00:15:26,263
That's what we have decided.

181
00:15:40,686 --> 00:15:47,751
We have set out, on
this path of life.

182
00:15:47,927 --> 00:15:55,800
Feels like we have found all
the happiness in this world.

183
00:16:21,794 --> 00:16:28,825
Why does the water make waves?

184
00:16:29,268 --> 00:16:32,795
Every moment is a new experience.

185
00:16:32,972 --> 00:16:36,408
Every moment is a new movement.

186
00:16:40,179 --> 00:16:47,745
Why do the trees seem like
they are touching the sky?

187
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:54,350
They are the dreams of the earth,
which have been fulfilled.

188
00:16:54,427 --> 00:16:58,124
You know a lot.

189
00:16:58,197 --> 00:17:01,894
You know a lot.

190
00:17:02,435 --> 00:17:06,098
You amaze us with your wisdom.

191
00:17:39,472 --> 00:17:41,940
Come on, everybody get down
one by one. No one will rush!

192
00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:44,870
l'll get down first. l'm the
captain. - No, nobody will get down.

193
00:17:44,944 --> 00:17:47,845
We haven't reached the stadium yet.
- Then why did you stop the car?

194
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,014
My clinic is in the building behind.

195
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:54,846
l have to collect important
papers. Wait here.

196
00:17:55,388 --> 00:17:57,413
lt's not safe for
a girl to go alone.

197
00:17:57,757 --> 00:17:59,884
Take one of us brave men along.

198
00:18:00,493 --> 00:18:03,826
Thank you. But wait here.
l'll be right back.

199
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:05,288
Mr. Mukherjee!

200
00:18:05,364 --> 00:18:07,229
See that nobody gets down.

201
00:18:07,299 --> 00:18:09,824
Okay? - Okay. l'll get down and
see to it that no one gets down.

202
00:18:09,902 --> 00:18:13,235
No, Mr. Mukherjee, you too
will not get down. Okay?

203
00:18:14,106 --> 00:18:15,164
l'll be right back.

204
00:18:15,241 --> 00:18:17,300
Please hurry up! l don't want
to miss the beginning.

205
00:18:17,843 --> 00:18:22,007
ln cricket, the first ten overs and
the last five overs is the game.

206
00:18:22,081 --> 00:18:23,139
lt's great fun to watch!

207
00:18:23,783 --> 00:18:26,308
Then why do they play the
middle thirty five overs?

208
00:18:30,523 --> 00:18:33,117
A lot of shooting takes place here.
- Shooting?

209
00:18:33,859 --> 00:18:34,951
Film shooting!

210
00:18:36,462 --> 00:18:38,191
Mostly horror films!

211
00:18:38,998 --> 00:18:40,056
Mostly horror films!

212
00:18:42,535 --> 00:18:47,973
A film was shot here,
'The death of a doctor.'

213
00:18:50,142 --> 00:18:53,942
ln it, just like this, a car
is parked on a deserted road.

214
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,007
A doctor is sitting in it.

215
00:18:57,917 --> 00:19:00,181
Suddenly a man appears
at the window.

216
00:19:00,986 --> 00:19:04,217
The doctor can't see him
because he is a spirit.

217
00:19:08,561 --> 00:19:14,022
The spirit possesses the doctor.

218
00:19:15,568 --> 00:19:20,267
And it breaks the doctor's neck.

219
00:19:22,508 --> 00:19:23,566
Mahatma Gandhi, save us!

220
00:19:26,912 --> 00:19:28,004
What's wrong with Dabboo?

221
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:32,108
He has scared him!

222
00:19:32,184 --> 00:19:33,276
He wants to urinate.

223
00:19:34,453 --> 00:19:35,511
Go out and do it.

224
00:19:35,588 --> 00:19:37,920
Nobody goes out! Nobody
is allowed to go out!

225
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:40,520
Then do it in here.
He will clean it.

226
00:19:40,593 --> 00:19:42,925
You can't do it in here. We'll
have to find a toilet.

227
00:19:42,995 --> 00:19:45,964
Hurry up! Else he'll turn
the car into a toilet.

228
00:19:46,365 --> 00:19:47,992
Control! Control!

229
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,930
Excuse me, gentleman! One minute.
- Yes.

230
00:19:51,437 --> 00:19:55,339
Where do you go to relieve
yourself? - Wherever you want.

231
00:19:56,609 --> 00:20:00,306
l mean where is the toilet?

232
00:20:00,379 --> 00:20:03,246
Where is the toilet? - That's what
l'm asking, where is the toilet?

233
00:20:03,449 --> 00:20:07,044
That's what l am saying
where is the toilet?

234
00:20:10,022 --> 00:20:12,115
Dabboo, do it by the wall.

235
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:13,956
No, that's not the toilet.

236
00:20:14,293 --> 00:20:16,420
lt's not one today. Tomorrow,
it will become one.

237
00:20:16,962 --> 00:20:21,228
Go! Free man of a free country,
freely relieve yourself.

238
00:20:21,433 --> 00:20:24,459
You will soil the country
on its independence day?

239
00:20:25,971 --> 00:20:27,063
Keep an eye on him.

240
00:20:33,012 --> 00:20:34,309
Don't look, he is
feeling embarrassed.

241
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:35,540
No, keep an eye on him.

242
00:20:36,482 --> 00:20:41,078
Then look at him in such a way
that he doesn't see. - Okay.

243
00:21:03,542 --> 00:21:04,668
Let go of me.

244
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:49,317
Blood was gushing out of his neck
like water from a broken pipe.

245
00:21:50,656 --> 00:21:54,353
The doctor was slim, tall, had
large eyes, wore a thin tie..

246
00:21:54,426 --> 00:21:58,055
..and kept two pens in his pocket.
- l'm not that doctor!

247
00:21:58,163 --> 00:21:59,221
l'm not that doctor!

248
00:21:59,632 --> 00:22:03,068
Stop it!
- l'm not that doctor.

249
00:22:04,403 --> 00:22:07,338
Did you go to relieve yourself
or build a toilet?

250
00:22:09,174 --> 00:22:10,436
Why are you so frightened?

251
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:17,080
lt's just a pup. Get in.
- Come in.

252
00:22:18,217 --> 00:22:19,275
Pass me the biscuits.

253
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:26,552
Where is Dr. Sonali?

254
00:22:43,642 --> 00:22:45,166
How are you, Rana?

255
00:22:47,579 --> 00:22:50,104
Don't ask me how l am?

256
00:22:51,116 --> 00:22:54,176
Tell me how you are.

257
00:22:54,253 --> 00:23:00,055
Acting on the insanity plea
your lawyer had filed..

258
00:23:00,125 --> 00:23:06,553
..the panel of four doctors
the court had appointed..

259
00:23:07,666 --> 00:23:11,124
..we have bought over
three doctors..

260
00:23:12,071 --> 00:23:16,804
..and the fourth who can't be
bribed has been kidnapped.

261
00:23:18,143 --> 00:23:22,170
All four doctors will complete the
formality of your examination.

262
00:23:22,448 --> 00:23:27,147
And they'll write in the report
that you are mentally unstable.

263
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:32,247
Then you'll be sent to a mental
hospital from prison.

264
00:23:34,326 --> 00:23:40,629
Getting you out of there will be as
easy as taking cash out of an ATM.

265
00:23:42,668 --> 00:23:48,106
Shrivastav, don't forget, the money
which you have been enjoying..

266
00:23:48,173 --> 00:23:50,471
..has been given by me.

267
00:23:51,844 --> 00:23:55,302
lf l have taken extorted people
then you have given me protection.

268
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:58,213
lf l have killed then you
have erased the evidence.

269
00:23:58,283 --> 00:24:01,252
You've taken a cut from every
illegal transaction l've made.

270
00:24:02,187 --> 00:24:05,452
lf l go, your whole
system will also go.

271
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:14,597
Sachin is still there.

272
00:24:14,733 --> 00:24:17,201
We're having fun watching the match!

273
00:24:17,269 --> 00:24:18,327
lt's a superb match! lsn't it?

274
00:24:18,637 --> 00:24:19,865
Sachin is playing really well!

275
00:24:20,272 --> 00:24:23,241
What a shot! The ball
went like a bullet!

276
00:24:24,376 --> 00:24:26,606
Come on, Sachin, we want a six!

277
00:24:27,146 --> 00:24:29,205
Come on Sachin! We want a six!
- Raja!

278
00:24:29,348 --> 00:24:31,248
We want a six!
- Raja, behave yourself.

279
00:24:31,316 --> 00:24:35,616
Raja, control! Watch the match
quietly. Don't distract Sachin.

280
00:24:35,721 --> 00:24:39,248
Quietly, my foot! 34 overs have
been bowled. We're still here!

281
00:24:39,324 --> 00:24:40,382
We came out to watch the match!

282
00:24:40,592 --> 00:24:42,890
Raja, l'll complain about
you to Dr. Sonali.

283
00:24:43,162 --> 00:24:44,288
What will you complain about?

284
00:24:44,363 --> 00:24:46,593
No violence please!
- l'll throw your pad out!

285
00:24:46,765 --> 00:24:48,733
Start counting! Start counting!

286
00:24:49,234 --> 00:24:51,464
Counting! Dr. Sonali! Dr. Sonali!

287
00:24:53,739 --> 00:24:54,899
Shut up!

288
00:24:56,441 --> 00:25:00,468
l'm out of my mind! l'm asking a
man, who doesn't talk, to shut up!

289
00:25:01,246 --> 00:25:04,511
l feel we should bring Dr.
Sonali from her clinic.

290
00:25:07,252 --> 00:25:09,846
That's it! That's it!
l can't stay here.

291
00:25:09,922 --> 00:25:11,617
Raja, sit down! Raja!

292
00:25:11,757 --> 00:25:13,247
Raja!
- Complain to her about me!

293
00:25:13,325 --> 00:25:16,260
Raja, come on!
- No violence! - Ten, nine.

294
00:25:17,296 --> 00:25:18,661
l must change his treatment.

295
00:25:23,202 --> 00:25:28,333
What's the score? - Happy
lndependence day to all our viewers.

296
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:31,202
On the occasion of 60th year
of lndian independence..

297
00:25:31,276 --> 00:25:33,210
..l am at the amphitheatre
on Band Stand..

298
00:25:33,278 --> 00:25:36,213
..standing next to the statue
of the great Mahatma Gandhi..

299
00:25:36,281 --> 00:25:38,613
..who helped us gain independence.

300
00:25:39,384 --> 00:25:44,412
Let's ask these people, what they
feel about our independence?

301
00:25:45,357 --> 00:25:49,453
Sir, tell me, how does it feel to
breathe in independent lndia?

302
00:25:49,895 --> 00:25:53,296
lt stinks! There is
garbage everywhere.

303
00:25:53,432 --> 00:25:56,333
The sewers are open. There
are mosquitoes everywhere!

304
00:25:56,468 --> 00:26:00,302
Diseases are spreading! Malaria,
blood pressure, diabetes.

305
00:26:00,372 --> 00:26:01,430
lt's terrible!

306
00:26:02,708 --> 00:26:03,766
Okay.

307
00:26:05,644 --> 00:26:09,478
Can you tell me who has written
our national anthem?

308
00:26:09,681 --> 00:26:10,739
Javed Akhtar.

309
00:26:12,551 --> 00:26:14,314
Can you tell me?

310
00:26:16,255 --> 00:26:17,347
Rabindranath Tagore!

311
00:26:27,332 --> 00:26:28,424
You!

312
00:26:31,703 --> 00:26:39,610
lndia is the most beautiful
in the world.

313
00:26:39,678 --> 00:26:44,479
lndia is the most beautiful
in the world.

314
00:26:44,549 --> 00:26:47,279
Do you know what Kalidas
Kejriwal did..

315
00:26:47,352 --> 00:26:49,684
..when he heard this song
for the first time?

316
00:26:49,788 --> 00:26:51,346
Who is Kalidas Kejriwal?

317
00:26:51,757 --> 00:26:54,658
Don't you know Kalidas Kejriwal?
- No.

318
00:26:56,295 --> 00:26:59,423
Neither do l, but l
have read about him.

319
00:26:59,631 --> 00:27:01,656
He was a soldier in the
lndian National Army.

320
00:27:01,833 --> 00:27:06,361
And do you know what he did when
he heard this song? - What?

321
00:27:06,438 --> 00:27:12,399
A feeling of patriotism arose
in him. Like this! - Okay.

322
00:27:12,945 --> 00:27:16,779
Then he wore his slippers.
Like this! - Okay.

323
00:27:17,049 --> 00:27:19,643
Opened his door. Like this!
- Okay

324
00:27:20,319 --> 00:27:23,482
And he followed the procession.
- Okay.

325
00:27:23,822 --> 00:27:30,318
lndia is the most beautiful
in the world.

326
00:27:30,395 --> 00:27:33,455
lndia is the most beautiful
in the world.

327
00:27:35,067 --> 00:27:37,592
Mr. Gangadhar looks like a real
freedom fighter, doesn't he?

328
00:27:39,871 --> 00:27:40,963
Nice story!

329
00:27:43,842 --> 00:27:50,771
But he didn't say whether
Kalidas returned.

330
00:28:03,428 --> 00:28:05,487
Raja, where were you
these four years?

331
00:28:05,931 --> 00:28:07,091
On a long holiday.

332
00:28:08,767 --> 00:28:10,029
At a mental rehab centre.

333
00:28:12,371 --> 00:28:16,501
Didn't you say that l get angry
too often? l should get treated.

334
00:28:17,709 --> 00:28:19,472
So l went away.

335
00:28:21,546 --> 00:28:22,672
l was there for four years.

336
00:28:23,515 --> 00:28:24,573
l have returned today.

337
00:28:25,784 --> 00:28:26,876
How are you now?

338
00:28:29,388 --> 00:28:34,485
The same! Mad, about you.

339
00:28:40,966 --> 00:28:42,456
l am the captain of the team.

340
00:28:42,868 --> 00:28:44,699
And half the team has deserted me.

341
00:28:46,471 --> 00:28:48,803
Who is the senior-most doctor
in Dr. Sonali's absence?

342
00:28:51,410 --> 00:28:52,502
Me.

Correct, me!

345
00:28:58,417 --> 00:29:00,647
Someone has to find these two
before Dr. Sonali returns.

346
00:29:00,719 --> 00:29:01,811
Who will do it?

347

Our future generations need it.

What is the price of independence?

358
00:30:23,235 --> 00:30:27,604
Are you a crazy guy? You loafer!
Get lost from here.

359
00:30:30,976 --> 00:30:32,034
Foolish woman!

360

Excuse me. - Excuse me!

Yes! - You can't litter
on the road like this!

390
00:32:08,673 --> 00:32:10,732
Why? Did your father make this road?

391
00:32:10,809 --> 00:32:13,778
No, he didn't make roads, he made
biscuits. He owned a bakery.

392
00:32:14,679 --> 00:32:15,737
Did your father make it?

393
00:32:16,681 --> 00:32:18,672
Yes, what will you do?

394
00:32:20,885 --> 00:32:24,685
ls this how you disrespect
your father's hard work?

What's going on?

396
00:32:27,058 --> 00:32:28,286
Are you crazy?

397
00:32:28,627 --> 00:32:29,958
Yes, l am. - What?

398
00:32:30,695 --> 00:32:31,787
Dr. Mukherjee!

399
00:32:31,863 --> 00:32:33,888
A patient from We Care
Rehabilitation Centre.

400
00:32:35,367 --> 00:32:39,633
He is certified mad! He might harm
us! Let's go! Forget him! Let's go.

401
00:32:39,704 --> 00:32:42,036
Don't stare at him! Let's go!

- Where?

406
00:33:00,892 --> 00:33:06,228
One is before me, the
other is before you.

407
00:33:06,731 --> 00:33:08,255
Have you consumed alcohol?
- Yes.

408
00:33:08,833 --> 00:33:10,858
You drink? Drinking
alcohol is not nice.

409
00:33:11,903 --> 00:33:12,995
You will die!

410
00:33:13,738 --> 00:33:16,036
Who says you'll die
if you drink alcohol?

411
00:33:17,409 --> 00:33:20,936
People die here because of water.
- Because of water?

412
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:22,838
How?

413
00:33:23,148 --> 00:33:25,742

00:33:36,795 --> 00:33:41,892
People in my village
die out of thirst.

417
00:33:42,701 --> 00:33:45,829
Or die after drinking
the water they get.

418
00:33:46,338 --> 00:33:49,865
Why blame alcohol?
- Excuse me?

419
00:33:50,041 --> 00:33:51,099
Answer me!

420
00:33:52,210 --> 00:33:55,373
Have you seen our doctor?
- Doctor?

421
00:33:55,447 --> 00:33:59,383
She's a beautiful lady.
- Lady?

422
00:33:59,451 --> 00:34:01,043
Yes.
- Beautiful?

423
00:34:01,119 --> 00:34:03,849

Hey you, free-spirit.

My restlessness doesn't end.

433
00:34:36,221 --> 00:34:38,746
l can't take my eyes off you.

434
00:34:38,823 --> 00:34:41,087

435
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:43,957

Keeps looking at me.

440
00:35:02,847 --> 00:35:03,939
Keeps looking at me intently.

441
00:35:04,015 --> 00:35:06,449
Keeps looking at me fixedly.

442
00:35:06,518 --> 00:35:11,080
He gazes at me from a distance.

443
00:35:11,156 --> 00:35:14,853

452
00:36:17,922 --> 00:36:21,414
Wow, what moves!

453
00:36:34,272 --> 00:36:39,141
You've renounced the whole world.

454
00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:44,211
And fallen for me.

455
00:36:49,587 --> 00:36:54,115
You've forsaken your loved ones.

456
00:36:54,359 --> 00:36:58,955
And become ignorant of the world.

457
00:36:59,063 --> 00:37:06,560
You keep looking at me morning,
noon and night.

458
00:37:06,638 --> 00:37:08,902
Am l so beautiful?

459
00:37:08,973 --> 00:37:11,305

00:37:57,021 --> 00:38:04,086
Tell me freely, O lover.

Keeps looking at me fixedly.

477
00:38:10,234 --> 00:38:12,395
Hey you, with the attitude.

478
00:38:12,470 --> 00:38:14,961
Hey you, free-spirit.

What are you looking at?

483
00:38:38,997 --> 00:38:40,089
Crazy people!

484
00:38:49,674 --> 00:38:53,735
There's my house l have

485

l..

486
00:39:00,551 --> 00:39:03,520
Shikha, l know you're
still upset with me.

487
00:39:04,255 --> 00:39:06,018
And you are totally justified.

488
00:39:06,090 --> 00:39:09,150
l mean, my behaviour was deplorable.

489
00:39:11,529 --> 00:39:15,761
lf you don't mind, can l come
to your house? Please.

490
00:39:17,035 --> 00:39:18,525
l want to apologize to your dad.

l mean.. you took me to introduce
me to your dad..

493
00:39:27,111 --> 00:39:28,703
..and l messed it up.

494
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:30,042
Thursday night.

495
00:39:30,114 --> 00:39:35,211
What?

496
00:39:35,553 --> 00:39:37,578
Why isn't any business
channel playing?

497
00:39:38,389 --> 00:39:41,119
Don't know but..
- Then switch off the TV.

498
00:39:41,526 --> 00:39:43,153
Why are you wrestling
with the remote?

499
00:39:49,133 --> 00:39:53,297
You know, you're just like my aunt.
She also watches TV all day.

500
00:39:53,571 --> 00:39:56,131
He's just joking, dad.
- No, l'm not joking. Really!

501
00:39:57,075 --> 00:40:00,169
She didn't speak to my
uncle for 6 months.

502
00:40:01,179 --> 00:40:03,204
Watching TV all day,
changing channels.

503
00:40:03,281 --> 00:40:04,543
She has even broken the remote.

504
00:40:04,682 --> 00:40:07,276
l'll get some snacks.

505
00:40:10,254 --> 00:40:13,314
Raja, what do you do?
- l play cricket.

506
00:40:17,428 --> 00:40:20,659
So what do you do?

507
00:40:25,703 --> 00:40:29,161
l said l play cricket!
- l'm not asking about your hobby.

508
00:40:30,374 --> 00:40:33,207
What do you do for a living?

509
00:40:33,277 --> 00:40:35,336
l play cricket for the West Zone.

510
00:40:38,182 --> 00:40:41,310
Look Raja, Shikha likes you.

511
00:40:41,619 --> 00:40:43,780
l have no objections but..

512
00:40:47,191 --> 00:40:48,249
What happened?

513
00:40:49,127 --> 00:40:52,221
He slapped me!
- What?

514
00:40:52,463 --> 00:40:57,264
Your dad has no manners! He's
blowing smoke on my face.

515
00:40:57,401 --> 00:41:00,234
Couldn't you tell me
to blow it elsewhere?

516
00:41:00,304 --> 00:41:03,364
Can't you see l'm sitting here?
Couldn't you ask before smoking?

517
00:41:03,441 --> 00:41:04,738
l'll thrash you!
- Raja, stop it!

518
00:41:05,209 --> 00:41:09,145
How dare you slap my dad?
Get out! Just leave!

519
00:41:09,213 --> 00:41:12,580
You're throwing me out! Throw him
out instead. Watches TV all day!

520
00:41:12,884 --> 00:41:15,216
You're sick! You've lost it!

521
00:41:15,553 --> 00:41:18,317
First, you hit an elder and
then talk rudely to him!

522
00:41:18,890 --> 00:41:21,222
People are right, you're mad.

523
00:41:23,261 --> 00:41:25,559
l am mad? l am mad?

524
00:41:26,664 --> 00:41:28,529
All right, take this!

525
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:33,303
Get out of my house!
Get out of my life!

526
00:41:34,438 --> 00:41:37,566
l'm leaving! And l'll never
come back, you watch.

527
00:41:48,586 --> 00:41:50,247
Dad, Raja.

528
00:41:58,729 --> 00:42:01,254
Uncle, l'm extremely sorry.

529
00:42:03,534 --> 00:42:08,597
l really behaved badly with you
that day.. - No, it's okay.

530
00:42:10,541 --> 00:42:15,205
Actually, you were right.
l've quit smoking.

531
00:42:18,216 --> 00:42:20,741
Shikha, can l talk to you
for a moment? - Okay.

532
00:42:20,818 --> 00:42:21,876
Please excuse us.

533
00:42:23,754 --> 00:42:24,812
l'll be right back.

534
00:42:36,767 --> 00:42:40,635
Shikha! Shikha?
- She's inside.

535
00:42:40,705 --> 00:42:42,502
Why did you bring him here?

536
00:42:42,573 --> 00:42:45,838
Dad, l met him all of a sudden.
He wanted to meet you so.. - Dear!

537
00:42:47,245 --> 00:42:49,975
You're going to get
engaged to Pranav.

538
00:42:50,581 --> 00:42:52,310
l'm Pranav.
- Raja.

539
00:42:52,583 --> 00:42:53,641
Great!

540
00:42:54,585 --> 00:42:55,916
Raja, what do you do?

541
00:42:56,454 --> 00:42:57,512
l have just returned.

542
00:42:57,788 --> 00:43:01,656
From where? UK? US? Canada?
- No, from a mental hospital.

543
00:43:01,726 --> 00:43:02,988
Great! What?

544
00:43:03,794 --> 00:43:10,324
No, l'm a mental patient. My problem
is l can't control my anger.

545
00:43:10,668 --> 00:43:13,796
When l get angry l'm uncontrollable!

546
00:43:13,871 --> 00:43:15,668
But l'm much better now. Yes!

547
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:21,340
Raja, what do you get angry
about? About everything?

548
00:43:21,412 --> 00:43:23,346
No, l was not that crazy.

549
00:43:24,615 --> 00:43:27,607
There are certain things which
l just can't understand.

550
00:43:28,286 --> 00:43:30,345
Then l get violent. For example..

551
00:43:31,289 --> 00:43:33,814
..people blow smoke on
others' faces, l mean..

552
00:43:33,891 --> 00:43:35,688
..l just hate smokers, you know.

553
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,352
They have no respect
for others' feelings.

554
00:43:37,428 --> 00:43:38,827
But l'm fine now.
- Great!

555
00:43:39,630 --> 00:43:42,360
And what do you do?
- Me?

556
00:43:42,633 --> 00:43:48,299
l'm a creative director for the
news channel, Aaj Tak. - Okay!

557
00:43:48,706 --> 00:43:51,038
Shikha also works there.
- Yes, l know.

558
00:43:51,309 --> 00:43:54,506
Actually, we are going
to get engaged.

559
00:43:55,646 --> 00:43:57,910
You know, she's so beautiful!

560
00:43:57,982 --> 00:44:00,917
She's so wonderful and fantastic
and intelligent!

561
00:44:01,585 --> 00:44:03,382
She's gorgeous!

562
00:44:03,454 --> 00:44:05,718
lf it were up to me, l'd
marry her tomorrow!

563
00:44:06,924 --> 00:44:12,385
Marriage! You will marry
her? l'll kill you!

564
00:44:12,463 --> 00:44:14,328
l'll kill you!
- Raja!

565
00:44:14,398 --> 00:44:16,389
Raja!
- l'll kill you!

566
00:44:16,467 --> 00:44:18,401
Shikha, stop him!
- Will you marry her?

567
00:44:18,669 --> 00:44:20,728
Shikha, stop him!
- Stop it! Raja!

568
00:44:20,805 --> 00:44:22,864
Stop it! Just stop it!
- Raja!

569
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:24,737
Will you marry her!

570
00:44:24,809 --> 00:44:26,743
Let go of me!
- Raja!

571
00:44:31,749 --> 00:44:38,951
Stop it! Stop it, please. Please.

572
00:44:40,358 --> 00:44:44,761
Why did you do this to me?
l love you, Shikha! l love you.

573
00:44:45,363 --> 00:44:47,763
How can you marry him?
- Come with me.

574
00:44:47,832 --> 00:44:50,096
Shikha, please!
- Come with me!

575
00:44:52,370 --> 00:44:54,429
Did you smoke before him?

576
00:44:54,705 --> 00:44:57,765
No, l just took out a cigarette.

577
00:44:57,842 --> 00:44:59,434
What?
- Yes.

578
00:45:01,579 --> 00:45:03,774
l got too hopeful.

579
00:45:05,449 --> 00:45:09,385
l should've known better. No one
waits for someone for 4 years?

580
00:45:09,453 --> 00:45:12,388
Nobody can! lf someone just
disappears from your life..

581
00:45:12,456 --> 00:45:14,117
..why would they wait?

582
00:45:15,393 --> 00:45:17,918
Do you think only you can get angry?

583
00:45:18,996 --> 00:45:21,396
l told you to leave
and you just left!

584
00:45:21,465 --> 00:45:23,399
Never thought about talking to me?

585
00:45:24,402 --> 00:45:26,393
And four years later you
realize you were wrong..

586
00:45:26,470 --> 00:45:28,938
..and you should apologize
to my dad.

587
00:45:30,007 --> 00:45:32,134
What a nice way to apologize!

588
00:45:33,811 --> 00:45:36,405
You know Raja, l feel sorry for you.

589
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:37,811
You haven't changed.

590
00:45:38,949 --> 00:45:42,612
Yes, l am what l used to be.

591
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:45,614
l was mad then. l am mad now!

592
00:45:51,028 --> 00:45:53,428
Our doctor had brought us here.
She went away somewhere..

593
00:45:53,497 --> 00:45:56,762
..and the other three were
boring me in the car.

594
00:45:56,834 --> 00:45:59,029
Where are they now?
- How do l know?

595
00:45:59,837 --> 00:46:02,499
How should l know? And
why should l care?

596
00:46:02,973 --> 00:46:04,838
They are not my responsibility!

597
00:46:05,042 --> 00:46:08,500
You're right. lt's not
your responsibility.

598
00:46:09,447 --> 00:46:11,642
Because it's the job of
a responsible person.

599
00:46:12,450 --> 00:46:15,851
When l needed you, you
behaved irresponsibly.

600
00:46:16,454 --> 00:46:19,184
Now perhaps, when they
need you, again you?

601
00:46:21,725 --> 00:46:22,987
You'll never change.

602
00:46:24,061 --> 00:46:27,724
Yes, never! l don't care
about anyone's feelings!

603
00:46:27,798 --> 00:46:30,198
Because l'm a selfish,
self-centered man!

604
00:46:30,468 --> 00:46:31,662
And l don't care!

605
00:46:32,470 --> 00:46:35,667
l don't need anybody in my life!
Not even you! ls that clear?

606
00:46:51,822 --> 00:46:53,153
Sorry!
- Pardon me!

607
00:46:54,492 --> 00:46:56,687
Sorry!
- Pardon me!

608
00:46:57,094 --> 00:46:58,891
Why did you collide from behind?

609
00:46:58,963 --> 00:47:00,157
Why did you come from behind?

610
00:47:00,498 --> 00:47:03,160
l noticed you went that way, how
did you come from the other side?

611
00:47:03,234 --> 00:47:04,496
Because earth is round.

612
00:47:04,568 --> 00:47:09,505
l got down from the car over there,
went around and came here.

613
00:47:09,907 --> 00:47:11,898
No, you didn't get down over
there. You got down here.

614
00:47:11,976 --> 00:47:13,705
No, l got down there not here.

615
00:47:13,777 --> 00:47:14,903
Had you got down over there,
the car would've been there.

616
00:47:14,979 --> 00:47:16,173
The car was right there,
where is it?

617
00:47:16,247 --> 00:47:18,715
Not there, it was here!
- Not here, it was there.

618
00:47:18,782 --> 00:47:20,579
One minute, let me
solve this problem.

619
00:47:20,651 --> 00:47:23,051
lt was here! Dabboo relieved
himself over here.

620
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:25,247
lt wasn't here and neither did
Dabboo relieve himself over here.

621
00:47:25,523 --> 00:47:27,855
lt was there and Dabboo relieved
himself over there.

622
00:47:27,925 --> 00:47:29,517
All right then, show me
how he did it.- Me?

623
00:47:29,593 --> 00:47:30,719
l don't want to!

624
00:47:30,794 --> 00:47:33,592
You don't have to actually do it.
Just take the position and show me.

625
00:47:33,664 --> 00:47:34,722
Like Dabboo?
- Yes.

626
00:47:40,871 --> 00:47:41,929
Okay.

627
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:43,798
Dabboo!

628
00:47:44,542 --> 00:47:45,600
Okay? Dabboo was over there..

629
00:47:45,676 --> 00:47:46,870
..and the car was behind him.

630
00:47:46,944 --> 00:47:49,071
Should l come back?
- No hold!

631
00:47:50,548 --> 00:47:51,947
Mr. Gangadhar, what are you doing?

632
00:47:52,016 --> 00:47:54,541
l was showing him, Dabboo was
relieving himself here..

633
00:47:54,618 --> 00:47:56,142
..and the car was over there.

634
00:47:56,220 --> 00:47:58,279
No, the car was not there,
it was here.

635
00:47:58,556 --> 00:48:01,616
lt's not important where the
car was. Where is it now?

636
00:48:01,692 --> 00:48:03,751
That's what we were deciding.

637
00:48:05,563 --> 00:48:08,088
Where is Dabboo?
- We have to ask Dabboo!

638
00:48:08,632 --> 00:48:10,566
l'll show you the car position.

639
00:48:13,170 --> 00:48:14,637
Raja! Raja!

640
00:48:14,705 --> 00:48:16,104
Just follow me!

641
00:48:16,173 --> 00:48:18,164
Wait! Where is the team going
without the captain?

642
00:48:22,580 --> 00:48:24,571
lt's so hot! Will you eat something?

643
00:48:26,584 --> 00:48:29,644
lmmediately ready to eat.
Must be a cop!

644
00:48:30,854 --> 00:48:35,314
Sir, l think he is a terrorist.
He dares to smile before you.

645
00:48:35,793 --> 00:48:37,658
Really? Hand him over to the police.

646
00:48:38,195 --> 00:48:40,129
Come on, get in the lock up!

647
00:48:40,197 --> 00:48:41,323
He's smiling again.

648
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:43,658
Dabboo, are you alright?

649
00:48:43,734 --> 00:48:47,135
Who are you? And why have
you brought this dog here?

650
00:48:47,204 --> 00:48:48,671
Hello, l'm Dr. Mukherjee!

651
00:48:49,940 --> 00:48:51,669
l'm the captain of the team.

652
00:48:52,142 --> 00:48:54,610
And he's my patient, Dabboo.
- Patient?

653
00:48:55,012 --> 00:48:56,809
What patient? What's wrong with him?

654
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:59,144
He's a mental patient
from a mental hospital.

655
00:48:59,750 --> 00:49:00,808
How do you know?

656
00:49:00,884 --> 00:49:02,215
We too have come from there.
- What?

657
00:49:02,286 --> 00:49:03,947
Because we too have come from there.

658
00:49:05,022 --> 00:49:07,616
You've come to right place. Pay
200 rupees, take the car..

659
00:49:07,691 --> 00:49:09,955
..and get going. l'm
very busy today.

660
00:49:10,027 --> 00:49:11,085
Why 200 rupees?

661
00:49:11,228 --> 00:49:15,221
lt's the day we got our freedom.
Let me take a bribe freely.

662
00:49:15,299 --> 00:49:17,631
Wife wants the new tri-colored
sari available in the market.

663
00:49:17,701 --> 00:49:19,692
She'll wear it this evening.
- Aren't you ashamed?

664
00:49:19,770 --> 00:49:22,034
You'll buy the tri-colour
with bribe money!

665
00:49:22,106 --> 00:49:26,634
Why be ashamed? People wear the
tri-colour and take bribe.

666
00:49:26,710 --> 00:49:29,702
l'm only using the bribe money
to buy the tri-color.

667
00:49:29,780 --> 00:49:31,179
What do you want?

668
00:49:31,248 --> 00:49:33,842
Our Dr. Sonali has been
missing for 5 hours.

669
00:49:33,917 --> 00:49:36,181
We'd be grateful if
you can find her.

670
00:49:36,654 --> 00:49:38,849
She has been missing
since only 5 hours.

671
00:49:38,922 --> 00:49:42,983
She's a lady doctor. She must
have gone out shopping.

672
00:49:43,060 --> 00:49:44,721
You'll find her where she left you.

673
00:49:44,795 --> 00:49:47,389
Besides this is the traffic station
not a police station. Got it!

674
00:49:47,865 --> 00:49:48,923
And the police will
also not register..

675
00:49:48,999 --> 00:49:50,261
..a missing person's report
before 24 hours.

676
00:49:50,334 --> 00:49:52,063
So what should we do?
- What?

677
00:49:52,136 --> 00:49:53,194
What should we do?

678
00:49:54,004 --> 00:49:55,869
Call her on her mobile,
incoming is free.

679
00:49:57,007 --> 00:49:59,066
l have her number.
Can l use your phone please?

680
00:49:59,677 --> 00:50:00,735
Yes.
- Thank you.

681
00:50:03,747 --> 00:50:07,740
The hutch phone is not reachable
please call again.

682
00:50:07,818 --> 00:50:08,876
lt's not reachable.

683
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:11,078
Okay. No problem.

684
00:50:11,822 --> 00:50:13,881
Call Dr. Malik. He'll
find Dr. Sonali.

685
00:50:13,957 --> 00:50:17,085
And he'll fire her and take

No! Who are you? Why have
you brought me here?

704
00:51:17,354 --> 00:51:21,347
What's going on? Why did you show
my husband's clips on TV?

705
00:51:21,892 --> 00:51:24,360
lt was definitely not
for your entertainment.

706
00:51:24,962 --> 00:51:27,760

No! Please don't do such a thing.

00:52:27,224 --> 00:52:30,819
One more thing, Dr. Sonali.
After signing..

723
00:52:30,894 --> 00:52:34,830

truth to anyone..

724
00:52:34,898 --> 00:52:42,236
..don't forget we can kill your
husband anywhere, anytime.

He is having whisky but
he calls it juice.

731
00:52:58,388 --> 00:53:02,916
Being a leader one feels guilty about
consuming alcohol on 15th August.

732
00:53:02,993 --> 00:53:04,051
Guilty!
- Yes!

733
00:53:04,862 --> 00:53:06,454
Mr. Apte have you spoken
to Mr. Shinde?

734
00:53:06,864 --> 00:53:10,459
Don't worry, Mr. Sanyal. We've
tied-up with every party.

735
00:53:11,468 --> 00:53:13,936

Let go of him!

760
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:44,018
Hey move!

761
00:54:45,295 --> 00:54:46,353
Don't fear him.

762
00:54:52,502 --> 00:54:53,560
Kidnap!

771
00:55:35,545 --> 00:55:37,536
Who are they?

They were there when she

Yes.

774
00:55:43,020 --> 00:55:44,078
Kill them all!

775
00:55:44,154 --> 00:55:46,349
Don't be stupid! Not here.
Take them away.

776

DCP Shrivastav, crime branch.

794
00:56:48,552 --> 00:56:49,610
l'm sorry, sir.

795
00:56:50,554 --> 00:56:52,146
They are terrorists.

796
00:56:52,489 --> 00:56:54,150
We've been on a look out for them.

797
00:56:54,491 --> 00:56:56,152
ls this the kind of
security you provide?

798

Will this create a problem?

802
00:57:15,645 --> 00:57:19,103
Had you told us they would
be with your wife..

803
00:57:19,182 --> 00:57:21,116
..we would've kidnapped them all.

804
00:57:21,451 --> 00:57:24,113
When l had told Sonali to get
the papers from the clinic..

805
00:57:24,187 --> 00:57:27,520
..she didn't inform me that
they will also be with her.

806
00:57:28,125 --> 00:57:32,118
Don't worry. l'll
bury them so deep..

807
00:57:32,195 --> 00:57:36,393
..that even your wife will
forget they were with her.

808
00:57:46,143 --> 00:57:48,202
Dabboo, where are we going?

809
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:51,738
Where are we going?

810
00:57:51,815 --> 00:57:55,273

Nobody should know.

811

Excuse me, sir. How far is Kakori?

Do you have piles in the mouth?

Piles in the mouth? How can
you have piles in the mouth?

814
00:58:03,226 --> 00:58:04,284
Do you get a headache
in your stomach?

Drive on the road not
on the potholes!

821

Where is the road? Potholes here!
Potholes there! Potholes everywhere!

And where there are none,

01:01:02,806 --> 01:01:07,539
..thou art the ruler of
the minds of all people.

860
01:01:07,610 --> 01:01:12,741
Victory to thee, victory to thee.

861
01:01:13,350 --> 01:01:15,545
Victory to thee.

862
01:01:16,753 --> 01:01:21,747
Victory, victory, victory,
victory to thee!

863
01:01:22,692 --> 01:01:25,559
Glory to lndia!

864
01:01:25,628 --> 01:01:26,754
Catch them!
- Stop!

865
01:01:27,697 --> 01:01:30,097
You should be caught!
You nasty people!

866
01:01:30,367 --> 01:01:33,427
He's right! He pushed my wife
during the national anthem.

867
01:01:33,503 --> 01:01:37,496
Those who don't respect the
national anthem are traitors!

868
01:01:37,907 --> 01:01:40,375
Thrash the traitors! Hit them!

869
01:01:41,711 --> 01:01:42,769
Hit them!

870
01:01:46,716 --> 01:01:49,446
First make a queue! Then hit
them one by one! - Hey you.

871
01:01:49,519 --> 01:01:50,577
We have to go with them.

872
01:01:50,653 --> 01:01:51,711
No, we don't!

873
01:01:51,788 --> 01:01:53,779
Let's go! Run!

874
01:01:54,858 --> 01:01:55,916
Move!

875
01:01:55,992 --> 01:01:57,459
Krazzy 4.

876
01:02:01,664 --> 01:02:02,722
Wait!

877
01:02:04,868 --> 01:02:05,926
What happened?

878
01:02:06,002 --> 01:02:08,402
Even Mahatma Gandhi didn't make
the British run around..

879
01:02:08,471 --> 01:02:10,939
..as much as they are making us run.

880
01:02:11,007 --> 01:02:12,474
Why are we running so much?

881
01:02:12,542 --> 01:02:16,478
lf we don't run, they will kill us.
Because we know the truth.

882
01:02:16,546 --> 01:02:18,138
That they kidnapped Dr. Sonali.

883
01:02:18,415 --> 01:02:20,474
lf they have kidnapped then
why are they after us?

884
01:02:20,550 --> 01:02:22,142
We should be after them.

885
01:02:22,419 --> 01:02:24,614
No, we should report to the police.

886
01:02:25,422 --> 01:02:28,152
They are the police! The police
have kidnapped her.

887
01:02:28,425 --> 01:02:30,620
But you said those guys
have kidnapped her!

888
01:02:30,827 --> 01:02:33,625
These are the policemen who
have kidnapped Dr. Sonali.

889
01:02:33,830 --> 01:02:36,958
Understand this, if we don't
run, they will kill us.

890
01:02:37,434 --> 01:02:39,493
And then no one will come to
save either us or Dr. Sonali.

891
01:02:39,569 --> 01:02:41,969
lf we run like this, they
will make us run forever.

892
01:02:42,439 --> 01:02:45,033
Then we should make them run like
freedom fighter Pankaj Udhas did.

893
01:02:45,642 --> 01:02:48,634
Freedom fighter, Pankaj
Udhas? He's a singer!

894
01:02:48,978 --> 01:02:52,436
Gangadhar told me he was
a freedom fighter.

895
01:02:52,515 --> 01:02:53,573
When did l tell you?

896
01:02:53,650 --> 01:02:56,448
You told me, Pankaj Udhas
was chased by a dog.

897
01:02:56,519 --> 01:02:58,111
Then he chased the dog!

898
01:02:58,455 --> 01:03:00,047
Then both stopped
chasing each other.

899
01:03:00,123 --> 01:03:02,921
That was not Pankaj
Udhas but Jatin Das.

900
01:03:02,992 --> 01:03:04,789
Mr. Mukherjee, increase
your knowledge.

901
01:03:05,462 --> 01:03:06,656
Sorry, l got mixed up!

902
01:03:06,729 --> 01:03:09,994
How could you forget Jatin Das?
- But l remember the dog's name.

903
01:03:10,066 --> 01:03:11,124
What was it?
- What?

904
01:03:11,201 --> 01:03:13,533
Name?
- Whose? - The dog's. - Dog!

905
01:03:13,603 --> 01:03:14,661
Whose dog?
- Shut up!

906
01:03:14,737 --> 01:03:19,470
Shut up! l'm fed up of you!

907
01:03:20,477 --> 01:03:21,535
Count quickly!

908
01:03:21,611 --> 01:03:24,478
7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1!

909
01:03:24,547 --> 01:03:27,015
3, 2, 1!

910
01:03:29,886 --> 01:03:36,553
Look, if we have to save Dr. Sonali
then we have to work as a team.

911
01:03:36,626 --> 01:03:40,084
Okay? Team! We are a team!

912
01:03:40,897 --> 01:03:43,229
Yes, we are a team! Okay!
And l'm the captain.

913
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:45,229
Quiet, absolutely quiet!

914
01:03:46,035 --> 01:03:47,559
Just do what l say.

915
01:03:48,505 --> 01:03:53,101
As long as we are a team,
nobody can harm us.

916
01:03:53,910 --> 01:03:56,902
Now we will not run! We give
them a fitting reply!

917
01:03:56,980 --> 01:03:58,709
First tell us what is the question?

918
01:03:59,516 --> 01:04:02,246
What question? - To which we
have to give a fitting reply.

919
01:04:06,723 --> 01:04:10,659
Are you telling me those four crazy
guys are more intelligent than you?

920
01:04:10,927 --> 01:04:15,591
No! l think they are more stupid
than those crazy guys.

921
01:04:16,132 --> 01:04:19,533
Don't worry, Mr. Sanyal.
Where will they go?

922
01:04:20,603 --> 01:04:21,661
Patil!
- Yes, sir!

923
01:04:23,540 --> 01:04:24,802
Seal the entire area.

924
01:04:25,542 --> 01:04:29,603
lnform every police station
to arrest these guys. Okay?

925
01:04:29,679 --> 01:04:30,737
Okay, sir.

926
01:04:31,147 --> 01:04:33,615
Hurry up! They would not
have gone too far! - Sir!

927
01:04:33,683 --> 01:04:35,150
Go along with them. Go!

928
01:04:36,886 --> 01:04:39,753
Shrivastav, what if those madmen
tell someone about us?

929
01:04:39,822 --> 01:04:42,620
No! Nobody will believe them.

930
01:04:42,959 --> 01:04:45,553
lf some madman believes them,
there will be an enquiry..

931
01:04:45,628 --> 01:04:48,096
..the truth will be out.
Your plan will fail.

932
01:04:48,164 --> 01:04:50,564
lt was your plan to
kidnap your wife..

933
01:04:50,633 --> 01:04:52,567
..to get Rana declared insane and..

934
01:04:52,635 --> 01:04:55,832
..then get him out of
the mental hospital.

935
01:04:55,972 --> 01:04:57,564
Was there any other way?

936
01:04:58,975 --> 01:05:00,636
His case will come up
in court in ten days.

937
01:05:01,110 --> 01:05:04,307
lf he reveals our names
in court then..

938
01:05:05,982 --> 01:05:09,577
l'll lose the Rajya Sabha
seat and with it.. - Great!

939
01:05:09,652 --> 01:05:12,120
You're worried about not being
elected but l'll lose my job!

940
01:05:13,189 --> 01:05:15,987
You businessmen and politicians
will pay bribes and get out freely.

941
01:05:16,659 --> 01:05:18,126
We'll be made the scapegoats!

942
01:05:18,928 --> 01:05:20,862
All because of your wife!

943
01:05:20,997 --> 01:05:22,589
Shrivastav, l had no idea Sonali..

944
01:05:22,665 --> 01:05:23,723
..would be on the panel
of four psychiatrists..

945
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:27,736
..appointed by the court.

946
01:05:30,073 --> 01:05:32,007
What's the phone number
of your wife's hospital?

947
01:05:33,076 --> 01:05:34,134
Where are those files?

948
01:05:36,613 --> 01:05:38,274
Yes, Dr. Khambatta here!

949
01:05:38,948 --> 01:05:40,210
DCP Shrivastav, crime branch.

950
01:05:41,017 --> 01:05:43,349
Did four patients leave
your hospital today?

951
01:05:43,953 --> 01:05:45,682
Patients! Yes.

952
01:05:45,755 --> 01:05:46,813
What yes?

953
01:05:47,223 --> 01:05:49,020
They have created havoc in the city.

954
01:05:49,092 --> 01:05:52,220
But sir, one of our doctors
is with them. Dr. Sonali!

955
01:05:52,762 --> 01:05:56,027
There is no doctor with them!
- Wait a minute, sir. Just listen!

956
01:05:56,099 --> 01:05:57,691
The police are looking for them.

957
01:05:57,834 --> 01:06:01,895
lf they contact you or if they come
there then inform me immediately.

958
01:06:02,639 --> 01:06:03,697
Note down my number.

959
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:05,832
We should call!
- Where?

960
01:06:05,908 --> 01:06:07,705
The hospital!
- Why the hospital?

961
01:06:07,777 --> 01:06:11,235
To tell Dr. Malik that Dr. Sonali
has been kidnapped by her husband.

962
01:06:11,314 --> 01:06:12,372
Phone!
- Phone?

963
01:06:12,849 --> 01:06:13,907
Keep it on that table!

964
01:06:13,983 --> 01:06:16,042
Excuse me, gentleman! Will you
please give me the phone?

965
01:06:16,119 --> 01:06:18,053
Excuse me, can we use the phone?

966
01:06:18,121 --> 01:06:19,713
Do you have 3 rupees?

967
01:06:19,789 --> 01:06:23,247
We don't have money. - You can't
call if you have no money.

968
01:06:23,326 --> 01:06:25,191
Please! - Get lost! - Just
one call! - Just a minute!

969
01:06:25,261 --> 01:06:27,195
Are you crazy?
- What did you say?

970
01:06:27,997 --> 01:06:29,055
Hail motherland!

971
01:06:29,132 --> 01:06:31,999
10, 9, 8, 7..
- Okay! Okay!

972
01:06:32,669 --> 01:06:33,863
Let's call from some other shop.
- Hey, leave it!

973
01:06:34,804 --> 01:06:36,066
Where do they come from?
- Come on!

974
01:06:37,674 --> 01:06:39,198
Hey, leave it here!

975
01:06:40,009 --> 01:06:41,271
There are Britishers everywhere!

976
01:06:43,012 --> 01:06:44,673
Raja, now let me handle this, okay?

977
01:06:44,747 --> 01:06:46,738
Greetings!
- Yes, what do you want?

978
01:06:46,816 --> 01:06:47,874
Excuse me!
- Phone!

979
01:06:47,950 --> 01:06:49,008
We don't sell phones.

980
01:06:49,085 --> 01:06:50,882
No. - lt's okay. - We don't want
to buy. We want to make a call.

981
01:06:50,953 --> 01:06:52,011
That will be 3 rupees.
- Excuse me!

982
01:06:52,088 --> 01:06:53,749
Go ahead.
- Excuse me! - Okay.

983
01:06:54,023 --> 01:06:55,888
But we don't have money!

984
01:06:58,695 --> 01:07:00,754
No money! ls this your father's
shop? - We don't have money!

985
01:07:00,830 --> 01:07:03,765
Mukherjee, l'll kill you!

986
01:07:03,833 --> 01:07:05,232
9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1.

987
01:07:05,301 --> 01:07:07,769
Don't kill me. Your fingerprints
will be on my neck! You'll be hanged!

988
01:07:09,105 --> 01:07:10,231
Why did you open your mouth?

989
01:07:10,840 --> 01:07:12,774
We could have told him
after making the call.

990
01:07:12,842 --> 01:07:13,900
What could he have done?

991
01:07:14,243 --> 01:07:16,711
But you should have
told us the plan.

992
01:07:16,779 --> 01:07:18,770
We are a team and l'm the captain..
- No, you're not!

993
01:07:21,117 --> 01:07:22,448
Let's call from here.

994
01:07:22,719 --> 01:07:24,311
lt's not for free. We have
to put a rupee coin.

995
01:07:25,054 --> 01:07:26,783
We don't even have a rupee!
- No!

996
01:07:26,856 --> 01:07:28,118
Let's ask someone for it.

997
01:07:29,058 --> 01:07:30,787
Excuse me. Good afternoon.

998
01:07:30,860 --> 01:07:32,987
l'm Dr. Mukherjee. Will you
give me a rupee please?

999
01:07:33,129 --> 01:07:35,120
Why?
- l have to make a call.

1000
01:07:35,732 --> 01:07:36,858
Why should l give?

1001
01:07:36,933 --> 01:07:38,730
Because l'm asking for it.

1002
01:07:38,801 --> 01:07:40,735
Really? Tomorrow you'll
say we should give..

1003
01:07:40,803 --> 01:07:42,930
..Kashmir to Musharraf
because he asks for it?

1004
01:07:43,740 --> 01:07:44,798
Where is Mukherjee?

1005
01:07:46,075 --> 01:07:47,804
Ask him whether he has a rupee!

1006
01:07:47,877 --> 01:07:51,870
Pardon me, sir. Do you have
a rupee? - Yes, l do.

1007
01:07:51,948 --> 01:07:53,006
Thank you.

1008
01:07:53,750 --> 01:07:55,945
Stay there!
- He has a rupee.

1009
01:07:57,153 --> 01:07:58,211
Then why didn't you
take it from him?

1010
01:07:58,287 --> 01:08:00,755
You told me to ask, not take it.

1011
01:08:01,157 --> 01:08:03,148
Where is Dabboo?
- Listen!

1012
01:08:14,971 --> 01:08:18,907
Excuse me, do you have a rupee?

1013
01:08:19,242 --> 01:08:23,508
We'd be grateful if you help us.

1014
01:08:26,783 --> 01:08:30,844
Excuse me, do you have a rupee?

1015
01:08:30,920 --> 01:08:35,323
We'd be grateful if you help us.

1016
01:08:41,130 --> 01:08:42,859
Excuse me, do you have a rupee?

1017
01:08:45,134 --> 01:08:49,798
l'm a bank manager. Take
my advice, mister.

1018
01:08:49,872 --> 01:08:54,206
One rupee, one million
or a billion.

1019
01:08:54,811 --> 01:08:58,804
Take a loan from the bank
and forget your worries.

1020
01:08:59,949 --> 01:09:03,214
Good advice. Okay, worries
are gone. Now what?

1021
01:09:04,020 --> 01:09:08,821
First send an application,
with the loan's intention.

1022
01:09:08,891 --> 01:09:11,018
Give us a guarantee.

1023
01:09:11,093 --> 01:09:17,032
Along with the papers
of your property.

1024
01:09:17,967 --> 01:09:20,561
lf you want a loan.

1025
01:09:21,838 --> 01:09:24,363
What nonsense! Do you have brains
or phone in your head?

1026
01:09:24,841 --> 01:09:26,035
Does anyone take a
loan for a phone?

1027
01:09:26,843 --> 01:09:30,370
Excuse me, do you have a rupee?

1028
01:09:30,847 --> 01:09:35,250
We'd be grateful if you help us.

1029
01:09:35,318 --> 01:09:36,910
Excuse me!

1030
01:09:37,320 --> 01:09:38,378
Excuse me!

1031
01:09:38,454 --> 01:09:39,853
Excuse me, mister!

1032
01:09:40,256 --> 01:09:41,450
Can you spare a rupee?

1033
01:09:45,127 --> 01:09:49,257
Stupid, you are asking
me for a rupee?

1034
01:09:49,866 --> 01:09:53,996
What l am and look what
you're asking for?

1035
01:09:59,475 --> 01:10:02,069
Wow! What a voice?

1036
01:10:03,012 --> 01:10:05,071
Has this doctor met a singer?

1037
01:10:06,883 --> 01:10:08,009
l'm a professor.

1038
01:10:09,018 --> 01:10:10,076
And a philosopher.

1039
01:10:10,152 --> 01:10:14,020
Why a rupee, l'll give you knowledge
worth a million. - Listen!

1040
01:10:14,290 --> 01:10:16,884
With globalization
and liberalization.

1041
01:10:16,959 --> 01:10:18,893
lnternational economy is changing.

1042
01:10:19,228 --> 01:10:21,287
Recession is increasing
and there is inflation.

1043
01:10:21,364 --> 01:10:24,094
And constant fluctuation.

1044
01:10:26,502 --> 01:10:28,629
lt's a matter of 10 rupees!

1045
01:10:28,905 --> 01:10:30,429
Only 10 rupees!

1046
01:10:32,241 --> 01:10:35,972
May your shares rise.
May your income grow.

1047
01:10:48,925 --> 01:10:54,329
O ten rupee man! O ten rupee man!

1048
01:10:54,397 --> 01:10:56,991
O ten rupee man!

1049
01:10:57,066 --> 01:11:02,333
You can move mountains, we
can't even shift pebbles.

1050
01:11:02,405 --> 01:11:08,344
You get 10 rupees. We can't
even get a rupee.

1051
01:11:08,411 --> 01:11:10,345
We can't even get a rupee.

1052
01:11:12,348 --> 01:11:14,009
You are stupid!

1053
01:11:14,083 --> 01:11:17,018
Learn the ways of the world.

1054
01:11:17,486 --> 01:11:23,015
Big things have value.

1055
01:11:23,092 --> 01:11:30,021
Always beg for big.
- Yes.

1056
01:11:30,099 --> 01:11:33,034
l'm a respectable beggar.

1057
01:11:33,102 --> 01:11:36,037
lf l ask for a rupee.

1058
01:11:36,105 --> 01:11:41,372
My position will be
reduced to dust.

1059
01:11:55,124 --> 01:11:57,058
Now l have understood.

1060
01:11:57,126 --> 01:11:58,593
Now l have realized.

1061
01:11:58,995 --> 01:12:02,522
The value of money.

1062
01:12:02,598 --> 01:12:04,190
The value of money!

1063
01:12:04,266 --> 01:12:06,063
The value of money!

1064
01:12:08,004 --> 01:12:11,064
Money is rounder than
the sun and the moon.

1065
01:12:11,407 --> 01:12:14,535
Money is more precious
than love and affection.

1066
01:12:15,011 --> 01:12:18,071
Money is everything in this world.

1067
01:12:18,614 --> 01:12:22,015
Life has no meaning without money.

1068
01:12:22,418 --> 01:12:26,081
Money! Money!

1069
01:12:26,155 --> 01:12:29,090
lf this is the world we live in.

1070
01:12:29,558 --> 01:12:34,086
l say, to hell with the world!

1071
01:12:43,372 --> 01:12:45,101
Hello Raja! This is Dr. Malik.

1072
01:12:45,174 --> 01:12:47,108
Dr. Malik, we are in a problem.

1073
01:12:47,176 --> 01:12:49,440
Problem? Raja, where are you?

1074
01:12:49,512 --> 01:12:50,570
l'm..

1075
01:12:53,516 --> 01:12:55,040
At a phone booth opposite
Chitra Cinema.

1076
01:12:55,451 --> 01:12:58,249
What? A phone booth opposite
Chitra Cinema!

1077
01:12:59,388 --> 01:13:00,787
Raja, what is the problem?

1078
01:13:01,057 --> 01:13:02,456
Our problem is..
- Tell them we have no money.

1079
01:13:03,192 --> 01:13:06,059
Tell them we are hungry.
Send some sandwiches!

1080
01:13:06,128 --> 01:13:07,459
l'm trying to talk. Please,
one minute!

1081
01:13:07,530 --> 01:13:10,055
Listen!
- Greetings, this is Gangadhar!

1082
01:13:10,132 --> 01:13:12,396
Give it to me. - Let me talk.
l'm talking! - Why can't l talk?

1083
01:13:12,468 --> 01:13:14,595
DCP Shrivastav! - Shut up! l'm
the captain of the team.

1084
01:13:14,670 --> 01:13:16,467
Our captain is Mahatma Gandhi.
- Hello.

1085
01:13:16,539 --> 01:13:18,268
Raja, where is Dr. Sonali?

1086
01:13:18,340 --> 01:13:19,466
That's what l wanted to tell you.

1087
01:13:20,476 --> 01:13:22,273
Dr. Sonali..
- Dr. Malik!

1088
01:13:22,344 --> 01:13:24,403
Hello! Hello, doctor!

1089
01:13:26,082 --> 01:13:27,140
lt got disconnected!

1090
01:13:28,417 --> 01:13:30,146
Let me talk!
- Dr. Mukherjee!

1091
01:13:30,219 --> 01:13:33,086
Hello! Greetings Dr. Malik.
Sonali has been kidnapped.

1092
01:13:33,155 --> 01:13:36,818
Raja is uncontrollable. And there
is no message from Mahatma Gandhi.

1093
01:13:37,093 --> 01:13:38,685
Mr. Mukherjee, stay
within your limits.

1094
01:13:39,161 --> 01:13:40,492
Do you understand what l am saying?

1095
01:13:40,563 --> 01:13:42,360
This is not fair! This is not right!

1096
01:13:43,099 --> 01:13:46,159
You gave the phone to Gangadhar!
Don't you love me?

1097
01:13:46,235 --> 01:13:48,169
lt got disconnected!
- Got disconnected! - Yes!

1098
01:13:48,237 --> 01:13:49,499
You didn't get to talk!
- No!

1099
01:13:50,439 --> 01:13:53,101
l told you only an intelligent
man can do this.

1100
01:13:53,175 --> 01:13:54,642
Raja, you're not worthy
of being a captain.

1101
01:13:55,177 --> 01:13:57,168
Raja, where are you going?
- Where are you going, Raja?

1102
01:13:57,246 --> 01:13:59,180
Raja, come here! l can't
handle all these people!

1103
01:14:00,449 --> 01:14:01,507
Let's say sorry to him!

1104
01:14:01,584 --> 01:14:03,176
Raja, we are with you.
- Raja!

1105
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:06,715
Sorry!
- Go on!

1106
01:14:07,189 --> 01:14:08,247
Sorry!

1107
01:14:11,260 --> 01:14:12,386
Why don't you understand?

1108
01:14:13,662 --> 01:14:15,186
l know we are in trouble.

1109
01:14:15,531 --> 01:14:17,522
But Dr. Sonali is in bigger
trouble than us.

1110
01:14:19,535 --> 01:14:21,196
She has always helped us.

1111
01:14:22,271 --> 01:14:26,537
Today she needs our help and
we are behaving like this!

1112
01:14:29,478 --> 01:14:31,207
Please! Please!

1113
01:14:45,494 --> 01:14:48,361
Do you think l'm mad?
You've gone mad!

1114
01:14:48,430 --> 01:14:50,694
Don't leave me, please! Don't go!

1115
01:14:50,766 --> 01:14:54,167
Really? l will leave you
before you leave me.

1116
01:14:54,570 --> 01:14:58,233
You don't know me! You've
driven me mad!

1117
01:14:58,307 --> 01:15:00,366
Yes, l'm mad! Completely mad!

1118
01:15:00,442 --> 01:15:02,239
This is the booth, DCP Shrivastav
told us about.

1119
01:15:02,311 --> 01:15:04,711
No!
- Get him!

1120
01:15:04,780 --> 01:15:07,248
Put them in the van!

1121
01:15:07,316 --> 01:15:10,251
Come on, let's go from here.

1122
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:12,782
Even the hospital is hand-in-glove
with them.

1123
01:15:13,189 --> 01:15:14,247
What do we do now?

1124
01:15:14,323 --> 01:15:15,585
Mahatma Gandhi will do everything.

1125
01:15:15,658 --> 01:15:17,717
Only he can help our
country get freedom.

1126
01:15:24,266 --> 01:15:26,257
Wait! Where is Mukherjee?

1127
01:15:47,690 --> 01:15:48,748
Mishti!

1128
01:15:55,364 --> 01:15:56,422
My daughter!

1129
01:16:17,786 --> 01:16:20,311
Are these curtains new?
- Yes.

1130
01:16:20,389 --> 01:16:21,447
They're nice!

1131
01:16:23,459 --> 01:16:24,517
How are you now?

1132
01:16:26,795 --> 01:16:29,457
Dr. Sonali says l'm
better than before.

1133
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:36,264
l tried to meet you many
times but you refused.

1134
01:16:37,740 --> 01:16:38,798
Yes.

1135
01:16:39,275 --> 01:16:40,674
Can l get some water?

1136
01:17:01,563 --> 01:17:04,555
Mishti misses you a lot!

1137
01:17:08,037 --> 01:17:09,629
There was a call from your hospital.

1138
01:17:10,906 --> 01:17:13,306
They were asking whether
you have come here.

1139
01:17:14,310 --> 01:17:15,368
Did you tell them anything?

1140
01:17:15,444 --> 01:17:16,570
l didn't know.

1141
01:17:20,716 --> 01:17:23,310
Some people have kidnapped
our Dr. Sonali.

1142
01:17:24,386 --> 01:17:26,320
My team and l have to save her.

1143
01:17:27,323 --> 01:17:28,847
And l am the captain of the team.

1144
01:17:29,591 --> 01:17:30,649
Team?

1145
01:17:30,926 --> 01:17:32,450
Are there others with you?
- Yes.

1146
01:17:33,329 --> 01:17:34,387
They're waiting outside.

1147
01:17:43,072 --> 01:17:45,472
Mr. Gangadhar, don't
go anywhere, please?

1148
01:18:09,031 --> 01:18:12,023
Under these circumstances,
l won't let you go.

1149
01:18:13,102 --> 01:18:18,369
lf l don't go today, l won't
be able to come back.

1150
01:18:19,641 --> 01:18:21,370
Can l help you?

1151
01:18:22,378 --> 01:18:23,436
Do you have some money?

1152
01:18:30,386 --> 01:18:32,115
lt's okay even if you don't.

1153
01:18:34,123 --> 01:18:35,920
l can't take your money.
- Our money!

1154
01:18:38,394 --> 01:18:41,386
l have just 400 rupees
right now. Keep it.

1155
01:18:43,932 --> 01:18:45,399
This much is enough.

1156
01:18:48,737 --> 01:18:54,141
Papa, look, l sketched my
mummy and papa. Look!

1157
01:18:57,012 --> 01:19:00,072
l also drew this house.
Mishti's house!

1158
01:19:02,418 --> 01:19:03,885
Give me a star!

1159
01:19:11,427 --> 01:19:15,420
Can't you make a star?
See, l'll show you.

1160
01:20:08,817 --> 01:20:12,218
Yes!
- Ma'am, Mr. Raja wants to meet you.

1161
01:20:13,489 --> 01:20:14,683
Tell him l don't want to meet him.

1162
01:20:15,891 --> 01:20:18,155
Sir, l'm sorry. Madam doesn't
want to meet you.

1163
01:20:18,627 --> 01:20:19,753
She's busy at the moment.

1164
01:20:20,496 --> 01:20:22,555
l'll talk to her. Please
connect me to her.

1165
01:20:22,631 --> 01:20:25,691
What are you doing? Security!
Security! - Yes ma'am!

1166
01:20:25,968 --> 01:20:27,026
Escort them out!
- Come on!

1167
01:20:27,102 --> 01:20:28,501
Please!
- Come on out!

1168
01:20:28,570 --> 01:20:33,166
lt's very important that

1169
01:20:34,643 --> 01:20:35,701
Come on out!

1170
01:20:45,787 --> 01:20:48,051
What the hell? What's going on?

1171
01:20:50,926 --> 01:20:54,919
Pranav, l have to talk
to Shikha. Please!

1172
01:20:55,531 --> 01:20:57,192
Please Pranav!
- Throw them out!

1173
01:20:58,867 --> 01:21:01,802
Pranav, let me talk to her!

1174
01:21:06,074 --> 01:21:07,132
Pranav.
- Stop it.

1175
01:21:07,209 --> 01:21:10,736
Sir, don't hit Raja!

1176
01:21:11,547 --> 01:21:14,015
We will not strike back! Beat
us as much as you want!

1177
01:21:15,551 --> 01:21:16,609
Shikha!

1178
01:21:18,554 --> 01:21:20,545
Shikha, help!

1179
01:21:22,958 --> 01:21:24,016
Stop it!

1180
01:21:24,092 --> 01:21:25,150
l say, stop it!

1181
01:21:28,564 --> 01:21:29,895
Pranav, what's going on?

1182
01:21:30,899 --> 01:21:32,560
They were trying to
force their way in.

1183
01:21:32,634 --> 01:21:34,033
Shikha! Please!

1184
01:21:34,102 --> 01:21:39,233
Can't you understand? l don't
want to meet you. Go away!

1185
01:21:40,108 --> 01:21:41,575
Shikha, we are in deep trouble.

1186
01:21:43,312 --> 01:21:46,179
Please, listen to
me once! Just once!

1187
01:21:46,982 --> 01:21:48,574
lf not for me, at least for them.

1188
01:21:49,117 --> 01:21:50,175
They are my friends.

1189
01:21:51,587 --> 01:21:54,317
Dr. Mukherjee.
- Hello.

1190
01:21:55,190 --> 01:21:56,248
This is Dabboo.

1191
01:21:57,593 --> 01:21:58,651
And this is Mr. Gangadhar.

1192
01:21:58,994 --> 01:22:00,586
Please Shikha! Please!

1193
01:22:01,597 --> 01:22:04,862
You've always accused me of
being a self-centered man.

1194
01:22:07,869 --> 01:22:09,598
That l shirk my responsibilities.

1195
01:22:12,608 --> 01:22:17,136
Shikha, today l am trying to
change. Won't you support me?

1196
01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:22,016
Shikha, l needed you
and l always will.

1197
01:22:25,220 --> 01:22:27,620
Please, help us.

1198
01:22:39,835 --> 01:22:42,030
Raja, it wouldn't make any difference
whether l believe you or not.

1199
01:22:42,704 --> 01:22:45,366
Nobody takes action on a
psychiatric patient's report.

1200
01:22:46,041 --> 01:22:47,633
Besides what proof do we have that..

1201
01:22:47,709 --> 01:22:50,644
..Sanyal and Shrivastav are
involved in Sonali's kidnapping?

1202
01:22:52,247 --> 01:22:53,305
Kidnap!

1203
01:22:53,715 --> 01:22:56,775
First we have to find out
where Dr. Sonali is.

1204
01:22:57,252 --> 01:22:59,186
And only Sanyal can tell us.

1205
01:23:00,055 --> 01:23:02,319
Why would he?
- Kidnap!

1206
01:23:04,126 --> 01:23:07,653
Kidnap? - What are you trying to
say? We should kidnap Sanyal?

1207
01:23:09,131 --> 01:23:12,191
Kidnap! That's against
our principles.

1208
01:23:16,204 --> 01:23:17,728
You know, actually he's right.

1209
01:23:18,874 --> 01:23:22,674
By kidnapping Sanyal, we can
find out where Dr. Sonali is.

1210
01:23:32,688 --> 01:23:34,212
Heads up! You!

1211
01:23:35,290 --> 01:23:36,689
Hey you!

1212
01:23:37,292 --> 01:23:38,691
Hey you!

1213
01:23:40,896 --> 01:23:42,693
Heads up! You!

1214
01:24:06,722 --> 01:24:08,314
Krazzy with a K! That's the way.

1215
01:24:08,390 --> 01:24:10,722
Say, K R A Z Z Y.

1216
01:24:10,792 --> 01:24:14,922
Do it anyway. Just put
the K in K R A Z Z Y.

1217
01:24:14,996 --> 01:24:16,987
Break free, go take a break.

1218
01:24:17,065 --> 01:24:18,862
Shatter all walls.

1219
01:24:18,934 --> 01:24:21,129
Break free, open your hand.

1220
01:24:21,203 --> 01:24:23,262
And seize the world.

1221
01:24:31,747 --> 01:24:33,738
Break free, go take a break.

1222
01:24:33,815 --> 01:24:35,749
Shatter all walls.

1223
01:24:35,817 --> 01:24:37,808
Break free, open your hand.

1224
01:24:37,886 --> 01:24:40,013
And seize the world.

Say, K R A Z Z Y.

1227
01:24:44,226 --> 01:24:48,356
Do it anyway. Just put
the K in K R A Z Z Y.

1228
01:24:48,430 --> 01:24:49,954
Hey you!

1229
01:24:50,766 --> 01:24:52,165
Hey you!

1230
01:24:52,501 --> 01:24:54,162
Hey you!

1231
01:24:56,772 --> 01:24:58,501
Hey you!

1232
01:24:59,107 --> 01:25:00,768
Hey you!

1233
01:25:00,976 --> 01:25:02,841
Hey you!

1234
01:25:16,525 --> 01:25:17,787
Heads up! You!

1235
01:25:21,129 --> 01:25:22,187

1237
01:25:23,398 --> 01:25:25,127

So get with me.

1239
01:25:26,334 --> 01:25:27,392
And you will see.

1240
01:25:27,469 --> 01:25:29,801
What craziness will follow.

1241
01:25:35,811 --> 01:25:37,802
You got to rule. Don't forget.

1242
01:25:37,879 --> 01:25:39,813
That you are cool.

Then where is Dr. Sonali?

01:29:19,034 --> 01:29:20,092
Her mobile is switched off.

01:31:58,259 --> 01:32:01,524
..on her way from hospital
this morning.

1354

Her husband, Mr. Sanyal has

1355
01:32:07,802 --> 01:32:10,464
lf my wife doesn't return,

They fooled me!

This girl is in cahoots with them.

Sting operation!

1366
01:32:40,501 --> 01:32:45,234
They think the public will find
Sonali to get the 50 million rupees.

1367
01:32:47,242 --> 01:32:51,235
Do one thing. File a report with

Dr. Malik, did you read about
Sonali's kidnapping? - Yes!

1371

Stage 3! About turn!

1543
01:45:17,591 --> 01:45:19,320
Dabboo,
- Stage number 3!

1544
01:45:19,593 --> 01:45:20,651
Give it here!

1545
01:45:23,397 --> 01:45:24,455
Hey!

1546
01:45:25,666 --> 01:45:26,724
Hey!

1547
01:45:27,001 --> 01:45:28,059
Here!

1548
01:45:29,403 --> 01:45:31,132
l'm not mad!

1549
01:45:33,407 --> 01:45:36,205
l'm not mad!

1550
01:45:36,276 --> 01:45:37,334
Shrivastav!

1551
01:45:39,346 --> 01:45:42,008
How is it going? - The job is
done, Mr. Sanyal. - Good.

1552
01:45:42,082 --> 01:45:43,276
Your wife should be out any minute.

1553
01:45:43,751 --> 01:45:46,151
Once this mess is cleared,
take Rana..

1554
01:45:53,560 --> 01:45:54,618
Hi!

1555
01:45:55,162 --> 01:45:58,495
Oh my God! l was so worried
for you, sweetheart!

1556
01:45:59,166 --> 01:46:00,292
l was so worried.

1557
01:46:01,035 --> 01:46:02,093
Are you all right, Sonali?

1558
01:46:02,169 --> 01:46:03,636
Ravi, why did you do it?

1559
01:46:12,046 --> 01:46:13,104
Why?

1560
01:46:14,381 --> 01:46:15,575
What are you talking about?

1561
01:46:16,183 --> 01:46:17,775
What am l talking about?

1562
01:46:21,188 --> 01:46:25,056
Why didn't l realize that
only my husband knew..

1563
01:46:25,125 --> 01:46:29,061
..l was to go to the clinic
in the morning?

1564
01:46:31,465 --> 01:46:33,330
He was the one who sent me there.

1565
01:46:34,802 --> 01:46:36,133
To collect the papers.

1566
01:46:38,205 --> 01:46:43,609
Why didn't l realize
that it was you..

1567
01:46:46,146 --> 01:46:48,671
Maybe because l love you too much.

1568
01:46:49,817 --> 01:46:53,082
Sonali, l was in deep trouble.

1569
01:46:53,620 --> 01:46:57,420
That's why you used me?

1570
01:46:58,358 --> 01:46:59,416
l'm sorry.

1571
01:46:59,493 --> 01:47:00,824
No!
- l'm sorry.

1572
01:47:01,295 --> 01:47:03,490
Sorry for everything.
- No!

1573
01:47:05,699 --> 01:47:07,166
l'm not mad.

1574
01:47:12,372 --> 01:47:13,771
l'm not mad!

1575
01:47:16,110 --> 01:47:17,168
Not mad!

1576
01:47:27,855 --> 01:47:29,117
What's all this?

1577
01:47:29,590 --> 01:47:30,648
Why are you taking my pictures?

1578
01:47:31,725 --> 01:47:34,125
You have to take pictures of
a criminal from all angles.

1579
01:47:34,461 --> 01:47:37,191
So that people remember
his face forever.

1580
01:47:37,464 --> 01:47:39,193
What do you mean? Am l a criminal?

1581
01:47:39,266 --> 01:47:42,133
You can see DCP Shrivastav
standing behind us.

1582
01:47:42,402 --> 01:47:44,870
He had kidnapped Dr. Sonali.
- What are you saying?

1583
01:47:45,139 --> 01:47:46,868
He's a criminal in uniform.

1584
01:47:47,141 --> 01:47:48,199
Criminal? Me?

1585
01:47:48,475 --> 01:47:49,806
Yes! That's true!
- What nonsense! Stop this!

1586
01:47:49,877 --> 01:47:51,139
What are you doing?

1587
01:47:51,411 --> 01:47:54,346
Who says l'm a criminal?

1588
01:47:54,414 --> 01:47:55,472
l do!

1589
01:47:58,152 --> 01:48:04,751
l saw you kidnap Dr. Sonali.

1590
01:48:05,626 --> 01:48:08,288
Kidnap! Kidnap!
- Dabboo!

1591
01:48:08,362 --> 01:48:11,160
Kidnap!
- Very good! - He is mad!

1592
01:48:12,166 --> 01:48:13,690
Who will believe these madmen?

1593
01:48:13,767 --> 01:48:14,825
Yes, we're mad!

1594
01:48:16,170 --> 01:48:18,434
We're mad because we don't know
the rules of the society.

1595
01:48:19,907 --> 01:48:23,172
Where it takes only a few people
to certify someone insane.

1596
01:48:24,311 --> 01:48:28,179
And a sane person, a criminal..

1597
01:48:28,248 --> 01:48:32,844
..needs just four signatures
to be called insane.

1598
01:48:34,855 --> 01:48:38,188
The person, certifying it,
his sanity is decided..

1599
01:48:38,258 --> 01:48:41,193
..by another insane person..

1600
01:48:41,261 --> 01:48:44,196
..whom we vote into office.

1601
01:48:44,798 --> 01:48:45,856
We are the most insane of them all.

1602
01:48:49,603 --> 01:48:52,197
The four of us are getting treated..

1603
01:48:52,272 --> 01:48:54,206
..so that we can come
back into your society.

1604
01:48:55,876 --> 01:48:59,209
A society, where you're fined
for breaking a signal..

1605
01:48:59,279 --> 01:49:03,739
..but not for breaking a heart.

1606
01:49:05,552 --> 01:49:07,281
You're punished for breaking
someone's head.

1607
01:49:10,224 --> 01:49:13,557
But there is no punishment for
breaking someone's trust.

1608
01:49:15,229 --> 01:49:16,287
Leave it.

1609
01:49:16,430 --> 01:49:20,230
We are mad because we like
cleanliness. A clean society!

1610
01:49:22,236 --> 01:49:24,227
The society can't be cleaned
by only sweeping the road.

1611
01:49:25,372 --> 01:49:27,237
One has to clear the mess in
the head. Who will do it?

1612
01:49:27,641 --> 01:49:29,438
Will l clean up your head?

1613
01:49:30,244 --> 01:49:31,302
That's the problem!

1614
01:49:32,246 --> 01:49:33,304
We realized it.

1615
01:49:34,982 --> 01:49:36,244
And maybe it was wrong
of us to realize..

1616
01:49:36,316 --> 01:49:38,784
..that the mess was in our heads.

1617
01:49:39,453 --> 01:49:40,784
Bhagat Singh was also mad!

1618
01:49:45,859 --> 01:49:48,453
Because he realized we had to
free our country by any means.

1619
01:49:49,863 --> 01:49:51,330
He was mad, indeed!

1620
01:49:52,266 --> 01:49:54,257
Else who is willing to
sacrifice his life..

1621
01:49:54,334 --> 01:49:56,325
..for the country at the age of 23?

1622
01:49:57,871 --> 01:50:00,738
lf a child cries on the
street then let him.

1623
01:50:03,277 --> 01:50:04,539
lf you do nothing, you are normal!

1624
01:50:04,878 --> 01:50:06,345
lf you try to pacify him,
you are insane.

1625
01:50:08,015 --> 01:50:09,277
When l meet Mahatma Gandhi..

1626
01:50:09,349 --> 01:50:13,012
..l'll tell him how many children
are crying today.

1627
01:50:17,291 --> 01:50:18,622
We want to go back to the hospital.

1628
01:50:19,293 --> 01:50:20,760
Take us back there.

1629
01:50:21,628 --> 01:50:24,961
Dr. Sonali, we are not
worthy of this society.

1630
01:50:25,299 --> 01:50:29,702
No! No, Raja. This society
is not worthy of you.

1631
01:50:31,371 --> 01:50:35,774
There aren't any honest people like
you in this society anymore.

1632
01:50:36,710 --> 01:50:39,304
Every man is selfish
and is even willing..

1633
01:50:39,379 --> 01:50:41,370
..to kill his kin for
his selfish ends.

1634
01:51:30,564 --> 01:51:31,895
Krazzy 4!

1635
01:51:38,905 --> 01:51:40,372
Krazzy 4!

1636
01:51:56,123 --> 01:51:57,920
Krazzy with a K! That's the way.

1637
01:51:57,991 --> 01:52:00,391
Say, K R A Z Z Y.

1638
01:52:00,527 --> 01:52:04,520
Do it anyway. Just put
the K in K R A Z Z Y.

1639
01:52:04,598 --> 01:52:06,589
Break free, go take a break.

1640
01:52:06,666 --> 01:52:08,395
Break all chains.

1641
01:52:08,468 --> 01:52:10,663
Break free, get ready.

1642
01:52:10,737 --> 01:52:12,796
The Krazzy 4 are coming.

1643
01:52:21,415 --> 01:52:23,144
Break free, go take a break.

1644
01:52:23,417 --> 01:52:25,146
Break all chains.

1645
01:52:25,419 --> 01:52:27,410
Break free, get ready.

1646
01:52:27,487 --> 01:52:29,751
The Krazzy 4 are coming.

1647
01:52:29,823 --> 01:52:31,154
Krazzy with a K! That's the way.

1648
01:52:31,425 --> 01:52:33,689
Say, K R A Z Z Y.

1649
01:52:33,760 --> 01:52:37,821
Do it anyway. Just put
the K in K R A Z Z Y.

1650
01:52:37,898 --> 01:52:39,627
Hey! You!

1651
01:52:40,167 --> 01:52:41,691
Hey! You!

1652
01:52:42,102 --> 01:52:43,763
Hey! You!

1653
01:52:46,440 --> 01:52:47,964
Hey! You!

1654
01:52:48,642 --> 01:52:50,109
Hey! You!

1655
01:52:50,444 --> 01:52:52,435
Hey! You!

1656
01:52:54,047 --> 01:52:55,446
Krazzy 4!

1657
01:52:58,051 --> 01:53:02,112
They make me nuts, when they
got cuts, they are insane.

1658
01:53:02,456 --> 01:53:06,586
They don't care when people stare.
They make everyone go crazy.

1659
01:53:12,666 --> 01:53:16,727
They make you drool, they are
no fools. They walk gaily.

1660
01:53:16,803 --> 01:53:21,137
They ain't mad, just don't care,
this is true indeed.

1661
01:53:23,944 --> 01:53:27,072
One crazy.

1662
01:53:27,948 --> 01:53:29,939
1, 2, 3, 4.

1663
01:53:30,016 --> 01:53:32,143
Shake it with me, close the door!

1664
01:53:32,219 --> 01:53:34,153
Break free, go take a break.

1665
01:53:34,221 --> 01:53:36,212
Break all chains.

1666
01:53:36,490 --> 01:53:37,889
Break free, get ready.

1667
01:53:37,958 --> 01:53:40,825
The Krazzy 4 are coming.

1668
01:53:57,244 --> 01:53:58,973
Krazzy with a K! That's the way.

1669
01:53:59,045 --> 01:54:01,513
Say, K R A Z Z Y.

1670
01:54:01,581 --> 01:54:05,574
Do it anyway. Just put
the K in K R A Z Z Y.

1671
01:54:05,652 --> 01:54:07,176
Hey! You!

1672
01:54:07,921 --> 01:54:09,513
Hey! You!

1673
01:54:09,789 --> 01:54:11,518
Hey! You!

1674
01:54:13,927 --> 01:54:15,724
Hey! You!

1675
01:54:16,263 --> 01:54:17,594
Hey! You!

1676
01:54:18,131 --> 01:54:19,860
Hey! You!

1677
01:54:21,735 --> 01:54:23,532
Krazzy 4!
