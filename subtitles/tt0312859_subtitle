00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:13,970
Mankulam, Northeast Srilanka.
A few years ago.

2
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:33,620
Shyama, do you know his name?

3
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:35,830
Dileepan.

4
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:38,560
Have you seen him?

5
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:46,300
You just hear his name and your sari
comes undone!

6
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:47,370
Oh, stop it!

7
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:50,310
Anyway it will come undone tonight!

8
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:51,970
Shut up!

9
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,490
Devanatha, happy your girl's
getting married?

10
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:12,170
Yes!

11
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:14,160
Why don't you get married too?

12
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:18,140
In 10 years your grand-daughter will be
old enough to marry me!

13
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:35,660
Younger sister, do you like the groom...

14
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:40,690
...your brother has chosen for you?

15
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,920
Are you going to stand
there all night?

16
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:51,730
Are you wearing a sari...

17
00:02:52,830 --> 00:03:00,830
...for the first time?
You look very grown-up in it.

18
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:13,490
Won't you talk to your husband?
Talk to him.

19
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:20,290
Do you know my name?

20
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:21,730
Shyama.

21
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:26,290
You know what your name means? Black!

22
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,460
I can touch your skin, darken your eyes
with the kohl on it!

23
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:39,140
So you think only you are fair-skinned?

24
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:48,980
Next to you, I look fair.
See for yourself!

25
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:52,160
- Look properly, not that much.
- Is that so.

26
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:57,500
As they say, a dark skin hides
a pure heart!

27
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:58,670
Yes!

28
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,000
Let me see it.

29
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,000
My heart is pure! And yours?

30
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,330
Just one thought in it.

31
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:07,010
Wait, I need to talk to you.

32
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:14,170
When eyes meet, words are not needed.

33
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:16,370
That's why my father always said.

34
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:17,350
Valluvar said that!

35
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:19,350
My father was the one who told me.

36
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:22,590
- Did he teach you this as well?
- You witch!

37
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:13,400
Make a wish.

38
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:14,910
What for?

39
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,240
To have a child soon

40
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,580
I'm going to get one?

41
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,250
Who knows?

42
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:29,250
Dileepa, I want 8 children!

43
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,920
Will that be all right with you?

44
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:35,600
I don't want children.

45
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:37,760
Why?

46
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,600
Because I don't

47
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,940
I want to know why!

48
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:58,950
Until there's peace...

49
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:01,490
...I don't want children.

50
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:07,960
Not until there's peace
in this country.

51
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,620
One day, the dawn will come.

52
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:13,630
There will be peace.

53
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:18,640
Give me a child then.

54
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:23,970
Until then, no.

55
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,810
I don't like that!

56
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,820
What do you like?

57
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,320
When I'm at home or when I'm out?

58
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:37,820
All the time!

59
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:41,320
I like bits and pieces of all
sorts of people.

60
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:46,660
Mottai Murali, who sent me a love
letter in the 10th. grade.

61
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:50,170
Then, my brother's friend who comes to
see me...

62
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:55,170
...every vacation. I like him!

63
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:58,680
He writes poems describing my beauty

64
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:07,180
I like Kamalhasan, the actor.

65
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:12,020
But more than all these people,
I like you!

66
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:17,530
And more than me?

67
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,200
God!

68
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:21,370
Then!

69
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:06,140
Go home. Tell your father.
He'll take care of you.

70
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:08,970
And you? Don't leave me!

71
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:10,480
Please don't leave me!

72
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,650
I could never leave you.

73
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,310
But we must stop these boots marching
and guns firing.

74
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,810
I must go.

75
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:23,990
Don't leave me, don't go away.

76
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,000
Go, Shyama! Go!

77
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,540

129
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,420

I often hit him on his head.
Just for fun!

152
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:58,200
Sorry, Vinay. Don't tell Father.
I'm really sorry.

153
00:16:58,580 --> 00:16:59,810
Then, Akhilan...

154
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:09,290

glasses are!

160
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:28,130

166
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:59,900
What's all this? Write about the whole
world for all I care...

167
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:02,030
...But not about the sister
who brought you up!

168
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,670
Is it true or not?

169
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,850
It's the truth!

170
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,170
Keep quiet! Write good things
about me.

171
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,010
Then, he will have to tell lies!

- My Tamil Teacher!

173

- Must be Akhil!
- It wasn't me! Appa!

178
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,850
- Was it your Appa then?
- Yes, it was him!

179
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:26,160
Amma, I have to go at once!
Then go!

180
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:27,810
You fool, I told you I wanted to go!

181
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,200
The telephone! Here, catch!

182
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:37,500
Quick, wipe yourself
before you come out.

183
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:42,110
No, he won't go out of town to attend
functions. Why?

184
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:49,190
Because his wife is ill.
She's mentally ill.

185
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:52,790
He won't go.

186
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,460
First thing in the morning.

187
00:23:58,670 --> 00:23:59,830
I'm your daughter, after all.

188
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,300
Did I ask you to come?

189
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:15,140
If you don't believe in yourselves,
how will others believe in you?

190
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:20,850
Next time you say you're depending
on me, I'll beat you up!

191
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,160
50 rupees for your birthday.

192
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,390
Don't tell your parents.
Buy whatever you want.

193
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,730
Anything I want?-Yes.

194
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:45,610
It's her ninth birthday.

195
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:49,210
We'd decided we'd tell her
the truth today?

196
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:50,420
This evening.

197
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:55,090
- You'll have to.
- I don't have the courage.

198
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:00,260
Did you bribe God?

199
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:03,050
A hefty bribe! To move my Tamil Teacher
to another section.

200
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:11,530
You take her. I'm not coming.

201
00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:15,500
Come on

202
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,920
I'll tell you a true story.

203
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:36,390
Don't ask me for endings
for your stories.

204
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:40,460
This is no story. It's
to do with you, Amudha

205
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:44,470
I know. I'm 9 now. If I behave
irresponsibly...

206
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:48,040
...Talk back to my teachers,
Call ma names in my heart...

207
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,970
...Hide my math marks.

208
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:52,140
You're not our daughter.

209
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:55,240
If I behave badly, you'll send me
to the hostel.

210
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:58,350
Amudha, listen you're not
our daughter.

211
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:02,280
If I behave badly, I'm not.

212
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,460
You weren't born to Indra and me.

213
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,560
You weren't born to us.

214
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:24,340
We adopted you when you were a baby.

215
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:31,050
Come here.

216
00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:38,930
We love you more than our own lives.

217
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:50,530
Akhil, Vinay?

218
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:54,530
They were born to us.

219
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:43,580
What's wrong with Amudha?
Is she ill?

220
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:44,950
She doesn't look well at all.

221
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:47,260
Akhil, Vinay?

222
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:50,430
They're playing downstairs.
What's wrong with Amudha?

223
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:51,930
We told her.

224
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:57,640
What a foolish thing to do!

225
00:27:58,370 --> 00:28:00,600
What was the hurry?
Why did you tell her now?

226
00:28:00,810 --> 00:28:02,100
We had to, someday.

227
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,440
When should we have told her? At 80!

228
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:11,780
I meant, she's not mature enough
to understand.

229
00:28:21,730 --> 00:28:24,290
It's better to tell her than
letting her find out...

230
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:28,960
...from someone else. Don't worry.

231
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:39,310
You look very beautiful
when you're worried.

232
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:50,150
Ma, aren't Akhil and Vinay like me?

233
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:56,990
No, they were born to me.

234
00:28:58,030 --> 00:29:00,160
Why did you tell me I look like you?

235
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:03,340
You do look like me.

236
00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:08,170
No, look at my arm.
It's darker than yours.

237
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:14,010
Whether you understand me, or not,
listen to me.

238
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:16,980
Nothing has changed.

239
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:22,350
Your father, Akhil, Vinay, I all of us
still love you...

240
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,680
...the same way.

241
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:28,690
Have you told them, Ma?-No.

242
00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:35,690
- Don't tell them. They'll hit me.
- No one will hit you.

243
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:43,380
Did you find me in a dustbin?
Who are my parents?

244
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:48,710
We are -Will you send me away?

245
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:56,220
Silly girl! We thought
you should know.

246
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:58,390
That's why, we told you.

247
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:02,390
Why did you tell me, Ma?
You could have told me later.

248
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:27,820
Is T. Amudha in this class?-Yes.
And you are?

249
00:34:28,090 --> 00:34:29,820
Her grandfather. Where is she?

250
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:31,890
That's what I want to know too.

251
00:34:33,370 --> 00:34:34,390
Didn't she come to class?

252
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,670
Chitra, where is Amudha?
What happened?

253
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:44,010
She threw up. I sent her to the toilet.
She didn't come back.

254
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:48,010
Any problem at home?
Did anyone scold her?

255
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,180
You should have been careful.

256
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:54,110
I'm going to tell the
Police Commissioner.

257
00:34:54,111 --> 00:34:54,951
He's from my village.

258
00:34:54,952 --> 00:34:56,690
His daughter studies here.

259
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:59,530
Don't try to intimidate me, Mr. Ganesan.

260
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,030
Why don't you call home?

261
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:10,530
She might have gone back with
someone she knows.

262
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:12,870
Don't worry.

263
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:29,380
Did Amudha say anything in class today?

264
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:30,890
No, she was very quiet.

265
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:38,200
She threw up and the teacher
sent her out.

266
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:42,570
Amudha! Amudha!

267
00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:44,730
Did my sister Amudha come here?

268
00:35:50,610 --> 00:35:51,580
Is Amudha here?

269
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:55,080
Did you see Amudha?

270
00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:09,720
Did you tell Amudha?

271
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:12,090
I told them repeatedly not to.

272
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:15,270
Who listens? They read psychology
magazines and...

273
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:17,180
May be you shouldn't have.

274
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:20,270
Where's Thiru?

275
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,780
He's looking for her.

276
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:39,750
Amudha? And you are?
Give it to her, please.

277
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,290
She's at the Perambur Railway Station.

278
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:55,300
Little one, why did you run away?
Are you okay?

279
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:04,480
I'll come. Don't be scared.

280
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:07,930
Put the policeman on the phone.

281
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:16,320
Sir, we'll come at once. Please stay
with her till we come.

282
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:24,590
When you see Amudha,
don't ply her with questions.

283
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:29,500
Hug her, kiss her the rest can wait.

284
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:34,950
G.K., have I ever told you
how to bring up your children?

285
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:39,840
Look, he's your sister's husband,
the head of a company!

286
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:42,180
He's set aside his work
to be with you.

287
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,720
I'm indebted to him for that.

288
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:45,880
But I don't want free advice.

289
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:52,360
Why are you crying?

290
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:54,530
We know where she is.

291
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:56,700
Because I feel like it!

292
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:01,040
How does it bother you?
Drive carefully.

293
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,540
Didn't I take good care of her?

294
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:09,180
I did!

295
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:07,090
Can I sleep with you tonight?

296
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:14,670
Ma's not talking to me.

297
00:40:15,370 --> 00:40:17,670
Why aren't you talking to us?

298
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:24,180
I won't talk to you
what's wrong with you?

299
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:27,690
What do you lack here?
What haven't we done for you?

300
00:40:29,050 --> 00:40:29,350
Sorry.

301
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:31,190
Throw your 'sorry' in the dustbin!

302
00:40:33,730 --> 00:40:35,190
Didn't I tell you she's angry?

303
00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:38,850
Don't cry. You've made us
cry enough!

304
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:46,030
Do you care about anyone
except yourself?

305
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:52,580
Tell me, did I bring you up
to be so selfish?

306
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,210
We almost died of worry!

307
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:01,070
What have I done to deserve this?

308
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:13,760
Sorry, Ma. sorry. Please don't cry.

309
00:41:26,950 --> 00:41:30,250
Okay, forget it.
You're still angry?

310
00:41:30,950 --> 00:41:33,580
No. I have to put these things away.

311
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:37,080
Really? You're not angry any more?
Promise?

312
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:48,760
Smiling? Write about any of this in your
next story...

313
00:41:48,970 --> 00:41:50,330
and the two of us will kill you!

314
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:54,770
- How did you read my mind?
- We'll kill you!

315
00:42:07,490 --> 00:42:08,280
Pray well.

316
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:17,950
I'll never do this again never,
never again.

317
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:39,640
Vinay says you bought me in exchange
for old newspapers.

318
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:41,420
Grandpa said so, I didn't!

319
00:42:42,190 --> 00:42:45,320
- Not I!
- Yes, it was you!

320
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,150
Eat, you big mouth.

321
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:53,330
Pa, did you buy me?

322
00:42:56,870 --> 00:42:58,170
You are priceless, dear.

323
00:42:59,870 --> 00:43:01,170
We adopted you, brought you up.

324
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:02,840
From whom?

325
00:43:05,210 --> 00:43:06,680
From her real mother.

326
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:10,510
Where is she?

327
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:17,560
I don't know.

328
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:23,550
She gave you to us and went away.

329
00:43:25,630 --> 00:43:26,790
In Rameswaram.

330
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:47,890
Amudha is crying, Pa.

331
00:43:55,590 --> 00:43:56,890
Don't cry, Amudha.

332
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:09,740
Why did she go away?

333
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:15,410
Her name?

334
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:22,420
What did she look like?

335
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:26,250
Why did you adopt me?

336
00:44:41,810 --> 00:44:42,930
We didn't adopt you.

337
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:50,610
You adopted us.

338
00:44:52,650 --> 00:44:55,280
'Umbrella' by Indra.

339
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:57,120
Who are they?

340
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:59,620
Leaving a land where
a matchbox costs 15 rupees...

341
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:02,740
...Where no kerosene, electricity, or
medicines are available; where...

342
00:45:02,830 --> 00:45:06,630
...War cries echo through schools.

343
00:45:07,070 --> 00:45:09,470
They flee the motherland, abandoning
all they own...

344
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:12,470
...Cross the seas to a land that
offers them no welcome and.

345
00:45:13,170 --> 00:45:15,970
And truly stranded at mid-sea.

346
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:21,140
All they ask for is the
shelter of an umbrella...

347
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:23,310
And a moment of kindness.

348
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:27,810
The so-called refugee camp we give them.

349
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:29,820
Is but an open-air prison.

350
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:34,480
Among the young boys and girls
the old men and women

351
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:39,160
is a pregnant woman whose baby...

352
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:42,160
...is in a tearing hurry to come
into this world.

353
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:44,660
This is the story of that baby.

354
00:45:47,910 --> 00:45:49,830
You are the one who first inspired
me to write.

355
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:54,680
You are the one who brought Indra to me.

356
00:45:58,120 --> 00:45:59,180
You are everything to me.

357
00:46:07,230 --> 00:46:09,190
She saw the baby through the window.

358
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:12,890
What compelled her to go away,
releasing herself from the grasp..

359
00:46:13,030 --> 00:46:18,830
...of the tender finger that recognised
her touch?

360
00:46:22,710 --> 00:46:24,840
What awaited her in her own country?

361
00:46:25,540 --> 00:46:29,670
Duty? Her husband? The war?

362
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:32,470
Who knows?

363
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:38,680
Her cheeks wet with tears, her
breasts heavy with milk...

364
00:46:38,990 --> 00:46:42,260
...she had to leave her baby as
soon as it was born.

365
00:46:42,630 --> 00:46:45,930
This cruel act can never be justified.

366
00:46:48,970 --> 00:46:54,370
She turned once, to look. Was it for
the last time?

367
00:46:55,210 --> 00:46:56,000
Who knows?

368
00:46:56,310 --> 00:47:01,110
The child's first cry flowed as
sweet as nectar.

369
00:47:10,990 --> 00:47:13,250
When I read it, I feel
in love with Amudha

370
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:15,930
and with the man who'd
written the story!

371
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:20,750
Where was I? -I wasn't married!

372
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:24,760
Just a moment.

373
00:47:30,140 --> 00:47:32,110
Saw your story in the magazine.

374
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:35,780
Is it your first? It's not bad.

375
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:38,950
Lies! I heard your wept
for a long time...

376
00:47:39,150 --> 00:47:42,780
...lying with your head
buried in your hands.

377
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:45,450
D'you have spies?

378
00:47:45,990 --> 00:47:49,620
Why did you write under my name?
What's the idea?

379
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:51,790
Are you the only Indra?

380
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:57,130
You should have used 'Alamelu' or
'Kamalee', your sister's name.

381
00:47:57,370 --> 00:48:00,300
You used my name since it's lucky!

382
00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:02,310
- Tell me the truth.
- You had me in mind...

383
00:48:02,311 --> 00:48:04,480
when you chose the name.

384
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:06,800
Haven't you heard the names.

385
00:48:06,850 --> 00:48:11,410
Indra Priyadarshini, Indra Parthsarathi?

386
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:14,640
How much do they pay?

387
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:21,620
I want a share of the royalty
50 percent. Half!

388
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:28,500
How was your exam today?

389
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:31,700
And tomorrow?

390
00:48:34,710 --> 00:48:40,170
Why have you'll come?
When did it happen?

391
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:45,850
Where did you go? Have you filed
a police complaint?

392
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:57,190
Bitter gourd's good for the complexion.
You didn't eat it!

393
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:06,860
Is Thiru back from work?

394
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:12,540
Help me to fold this.

395
00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:17,200
- I have a Sociology exam tomorrow.
- My weakest subject.

396
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:19,260
Not that you're any
better at the others!

397
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:22,390
See what your dear son's done!

398
00:49:22,590 --> 00:49:27,390
He thinks he's a water carrier!

399
00:49:30,430 --> 00:49:31,900
How many times a day must you...?

400
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:37,730
Was what you wrote true or all lies?

401
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:39,900
One blow and all your
32 teeth will fall out!

402
00:49:40,270 --> 00:49:44,070
- 31 . The creator made a mistake!
- 31 then!

403
00:49:46,210 --> 00:49:50,410
- Is the baby in the story real?
- Yes, she's at the red cross centre.

404
00:49:52,350 --> 00:49:55,750
I want to see the baby, will you
take me there?

405
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:00,090
I definitely won't!

406
00:50:05,630 --> 00:50:07,100
Have you started on your next story?

407
00:50:08,470 --> 00:50:10,940
I want my 50 percent royalty!

408
00:50:11,170 --> 00:50:14,610
- Do me a favour first.
- Nothing embarrassing, please!

409
00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:16,610
Forget it, then.

410
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:18,610
I'll manage, tell me.

411
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:25,950
- No, you won't like it.
- Don't keep me guessing.

412
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:31,950
- No, you won't agree.
- Please, I will.

413
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:33,280
I'll agree, I will.

414
00:50:34,390 --> 00:50:36,450
You mustn't say a word
till we get there.

415
00:50:36,660 --> 00:50:37,630
Can you do that?

416
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:01,650
Thiruselvan, I read the story.

417
00:51:02,090 --> 00:51:03,650
It was published under another name?

418
00:51:04,690 --> 00:51:06,490
He borrowed mine.

419
00:51:07,190 --> 00:51:08,990
- How is father?
- He's fine.

420
00:51:09,230 --> 00:51:12,490
- It was such a moving story.
- Can we see the baby?

421
00:51:15,870 --> 00:51:18,670
It was beautiful, wasn't it?
I cried too.

422
00:52:03,150 --> 00:52:03,880
What's your name?

423
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:07,420
Your name?

424
00:52:09,090 --> 00:52:12,220
Such a great writer and you can't
think of a name?

425
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:16,550
Shall I name her then?

426
00:52:19,930 --> 00:52:22,900
Her first cry flowed out like nectar,
like Amudham.

427
00:52:28,770 --> 00:52:30,470
Are you going to adopt this baby...

428
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:37,910
...Or not?

429
00:52:40,290 --> 00:52:42,580
Or do your ideals stop at the level
of story-writing?

430
00:52:44,290 --> 00:52:46,760
Look, she's pointing in the
direction of Srilanka.

431
00:52:51,660 --> 00:52:53,260
Does your mother live there?

432
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:55,430
She left you and went away?

433
00:52:56,300 --> 00:52:57,600
You don't have anyone?

434
00:52:59,970 --> 00:53:01,770
My mother left me too.

435
00:53:03,810 --> 00:53:07,940
Is this engineer writing stories
about you, to make money?

436
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:10,950
Ask him if it's enough to just
write a story.

437
00:53:37,010 --> 00:53:40,640
Fool! Will anyone adopt a baby before
getting married?

438
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:43,810
What's wrong?

439
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:47,820
If you want to bathe a baby,
powder its body,

440
00:53:48,020 --> 00:53:52,320
and change its nappies, then adopt
the baby I'm carrying.

441
00:53:52,590 --> 00:53:56,990
Not some dark-skinned orphan,
could be diseased.

442
00:53:57,330 --> 00:53:58,250
They'll check all that.

443
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:01,660
Shut up. All this can
happen only in stories.

444
00:54:01,870 --> 00:54:06,000
Say it again and I'll go back to my
husband's home in Madras!

445
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:10,500
Right. I just need your signature
at the red cross centre.

446
00:54:10,710 --> 00:54:14,170
Have you gone crazy?
Don't you understand?

447
00:54:14,550 --> 00:54:17,170
Over my dead body!

448
00:54:34,630 --> 00:54:35,190
Akka!

449
00:54:44,910 --> 00:54:47,380
- The groom is?
- Manager in a granite factory.

450
00:54:48,910 --> 00:54:51,380
Come in, you're just in time.

451
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:53,210
Get him a chair.

452
00:54:54,620 --> 00:54:56,020
He's our neighbour.

453
00:54:56,420 --> 00:54:59,550
He's the engineer for the huge factory
in the next town.

454
00:55:00,090 --> 00:55:04,220
He also writes stories with titles
like'Umbrella', 'Mountain', 'Urn'.

455
00:55:07,670 --> 00:55:08,768
He's come to get his keys.

456
00:55:08,769 --> 00:55:09,890
Carry on, I'll come.

457
00:55:25,950 --> 00:55:28,929
Just a moment,
sir.Couldn't smoke inside.

458
00:55:28,930 --> 00:55:31,910
A match box?

459
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:32,920
Don't have one.

460
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:35,260
I don't have time to read books.

461
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:38,090
But I scan the horoscopes and read
the gossip columns.

462
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:40,260
You have excellent taste in literature.

463
00:55:42,470 --> 00:55:45,440
Just a minute. what's Indra like?

464
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:50,930
You live next door. You'll know
if there's any gossip about her.

465
00:55:51,140 --> 00:55:52,940
What did you say your name was?
Dhanraj.

466
00:55:54,180 --> 00:55:58,950
Dhanraj, speak with respect and
leave quietly.

467
00:56:00,490 --> 00:56:02,610
I not only write I hit people as well!

468
00:56:12,830 --> 00:56:14,800
Finished -one moment.

469
00:56:17,070 --> 00:56:20,130
Here comes the bride!
So the groom is rich.

470
00:56:20,340 --> 00:56:23,800
He'll build her a house with the
granite he mines.

471
00:56:24,180 --> 00:56:30,510
I was really worried that
you would charm my brother!

472
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:33,140
He's not easy to charm.

473
00:56:34,350 --> 00:56:35,580
I'm going to commit suicide.

474
00:56:36,190 --> 00:56:39,490
Are you? I'm sure I can write a
story about it.

475
00:56:40,530 --> 00:56:46,660
How will you do it?
You can drown or swallow barbiturates.

476
00:56:47,370 --> 00:56:48,990
The cheapest and best way is hanging.

477
00:56:49,430 --> 00:56:51,490
A Sari, a metal ring;
That's all you need.

478
00:56:52,570 --> 00:56:55,660
But don't try hanging from the fans
in your house.

479
00:56:56,040 --> 00:56:57,340
They're too old!

480
00:56:58,040 --> 00:56:59,510
Is that all you have to say?

481
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:06,180
I think the girl's in love with you.

482
00:57:07,790 --> 00:57:08,840
D'you love her?

483
00:57:12,790 --> 00:57:14,190
Why don't you do something?

484
00:57:14,790 --> 00:57:15,690
What should I do?

485
00:57:16,590 --> 00:57:17,360
Elope!

486
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:22,660
If she has courage, strength of mind,

487
00:57:23,230 --> 00:57:25,700
she'll refuse to marry the quarry owner.

488
00:57:27,010 --> 00:57:29,030
Maybe she thought you'd stop her!

489
00:57:29,910 --> 00:57:31,710
A letter from your husband.

490
00:57:32,580 --> 00:57:33,700
A letter from your father.

491
00:57:43,590 --> 00:57:45,390
This is my sister, Mrs. Kamala Kumar.

492
00:57:46,260 --> 00:57:48,890
You know Tahsildar Ganesan.

493
00:57:49,590 --> 00:57:53,890
Both will sign along with me.
I would like to adopt Amudha.

494
00:57:55,630 --> 00:57:58,230
Did you bring me here for this?

495
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:03,070
You talk, you write,
now you want to act on your words.

496
00:58:03,270 --> 00:58:05,400
Bravo! But is this really practical?

497
00:58:07,950 --> 00:58:09,000
Did I ask for advice?

498
00:58:10,950 --> 00:58:12,920
I will, a 100 times. but they...

499
00:58:13,950 --> 00:58:16,510
Thiruchelvan, are you married?

500
00:58:19,620 --> 00:58:23,250
My sister is. She has a child,
expects another soon.

501
00:58:23,460 --> 00:58:25,760
Her husband works in Madras.

502
00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:28,090
Mr. Ganesan will vouch for us.

503
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,590
Who is adopting the baby?
You or your sister?

504
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:35,760
Not me. He will. I've
said what I wanted.

505
00:58:38,340 --> 00:58:43,440
Thiruchelvan, your
intentions are honourable.

506
00:58:44,350 --> 00:58:47,280
But we don't allow unmarried people,
especially men...

507
00:58:47,990 --> 00:58:49,450
to adopt babies.

508
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:53,120
The social welfare board
will not permit it.

509
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:01,300
I don't know what more to say.

510
00:59:45,810 --> 00:59:46,500
Is Indra in?

511
00:59:52,620 --> 00:59:53,680
What have you brought?

512
00:59:54,390 --> 00:59:56,850
A stone or a rope for me
to commit suicide with?

513
00:59:57,820 --> 01:00:01,350
- How old are you?
- How old do I look?

514
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:04,860
- Are you over 18?
- What if I am?

515
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:10,690
Will you marry me?
And be a mother to Amudha?

516
01:00:17,310 --> 01:00:18,470
Think well before you answer.

517
01:00:43,670 --> 01:00:47,400
- Will you please go in?
- What?

518
01:01:01,790 --> 01:01:02,750
We are not wanted here.

519
01:01:04,020 --> 01:01:04,920
Are you crying?

520
01:01:08,460 --> 01:01:09,260
Why are you crying?

521
01:01:13,030 --> 01:01:14,930
I waited a whole year.

522
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:19,930
You noticed me only because of the baby.
Am I a free gift with the baby?

523
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:22,720
Are you crying because
I said I like you?

524
01:01:22,721 --> 01:01:23,321
Don't touch me!

525
01:01:26,380 --> 01:01:28,280
Are you adopting Amudha for my sake...

526
01:01:29,180 --> 01:01:30,770
or marrying me for her sake?

527
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:37,120
I like this eye, the other one as well.

528
01:01:38,490 --> 01:01:40,620
I want this cheek, the
other one as well.

529
01:01:40,790 --> 01:01:42,160
Stop! Stop!

530
01:01:42,530 --> 01:01:45,550
If I marry you, I have
certain conditions.

531
01:01:45,830 --> 01:01:46,800
You'll have to...

532
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:08,780
What is this nonsense?

533
01:02:13,190 --> 01:02:13,990
Go, go away...

534
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:23,660
What's wrong with her?
And what's wrong with you?

535
01:02:24,370 --> 01:02:26,170
Can't leave you alone for 2 minutes!

536
01:02:27,110 --> 01:02:28,660
What's this you've done?

537
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:35,810
This isn't a chapter in a story,
is it? It's real, isn't it?

538
01:02:42,550 --> 01:02:46,180
The Tahsildar's here! Go away now!

539
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:50,600
What d'you think you're doing?
Didn't you hear me?

540
01:02:52,930 --> 01:02:54,360
I'll hit you now! Go in!

541
01:03:02,410 --> 01:03:03,530
You rascal!

542
01:03:03,810 --> 01:03:06,540
- Such a short tempered sister!
- Silly fellow!

543
01:03:12,750 --> 01:03:14,310
Why are you standing at the door?

544
01:03:16,150 --> 01:03:16,710
Coffee?

545
01:03:16,950 --> 01:03:17,720
Bring him coffee.

546
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:21,720
Ganesan, I would like to
marry your daughter...

547
01:03:25,160 --> 01:03:26,560
And I would like to adopt Amudha.

548
01:03:28,630 --> 01:03:30,150
For the first, I need your permission.

549
01:03:30,970 --> 01:03:32,600
For the second, I need your signature.

550
01:04:27,430 --> 01:04:28,950
Why did she leave me and go away?

551
01:04:33,900 --> 01:04:36,960
For me. For all of us.

552
01:05:15,870 --> 01:05:18,340
- Vinay, don't take that. It's mine.
- Careful!

553
01:05:21,380 --> 01:05:24,010
- Give it back to me!
- Don't read it.

554
01:05:26,380 --> 01:05:31,010
Photographs of Amudha the great!
Right from the time she was a baby!

555
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:35,850
- 'For my mother '
- Which one? The real one?

556
01:05:36,060 --> 01:05:37,690
Don't read it. It's my diary.

557
01:05:39,300 --> 01:05:42,200
'Why did you leave me and go?'

558
01:05:42,430 --> 01:05:44,530
Because she had to go to the toilet!

559
01:05:49,110 --> 01:05:52,040
Ma, Amudha and Vinay are having a fight.

560
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:57,700
Vinay is pulling her hair
Amudha is biting his hand.

561
01:06:03,190 --> 01:06:04,050
What is it now?

562
01:06:04,590 --> 01:06:06,060
- He started it!
- No, she did!

563
01:06:08,090 --> 01:06:12,220
Who started it? Can't both
of you ever be quiet!

564
01:06:19,340 --> 01:06:20,070
Grandfather!

565
01:06:23,110 --> 01:06:25,740
What's my mother's name?
My real mother's name?

566
01:06:32,780 --> 01:06:35,580
Shyama. M.D.Shyama.

567
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:40,600
She was from the village of Mankulam.

568
01:06:41,460 --> 01:06:46,420
Her father's name was
Devanathan or Devanesan.

569
01:06:47,230 --> 01:06:49,190
Something like that was
written in the register.

570
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:53,930
Have you seen her? What
did she look like?

571
01:06:55,240 --> 01:06:57,940
I've seen her, but I don't remember her.

572
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:02,770
She delivered you in a
Red Cross camp in Rameswaram.

573
01:07:07,320 --> 01:07:09,120
Why did she leave me and go away?

574
01:07:11,320 --> 01:07:12,950
Where is Rameswaram?

575
01:07:27,340 --> 01:07:30,800
- Indra, did Pradeep come there?
- Is Pradeep here?

576
01:07:31,080 --> 01:07:32,800
- Don't know.
- Don't know.

577
01:07:32,980 --> 01:07:35,070
- No, why?
- He's not home as yet?

578
01:07:39,420 --> 01:07:41,540
If he comes here, I'll tell him
to call you at once.

579
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:53,820
Amudha! Vinay, where's Amudha?

580
01:07:54,030 --> 01:07:54,660
Don't know.

581
01:08:03,710 --> 01:08:06,680
Vinay, look at me. Don't you know
where Amudha is?

582
01:08:06,910 --> 01:08:13,180
- Don't know.
- Tell me!

583
01:08:13,380 --> 01:08:14,350
Where's she?

584
01:08:14,890 --> 01:08:18,010
Amudha and Pradeep have gone in a bus.

585
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:21,530
Where?

586
01:08:21,730 --> 01:08:23,020
Rameswaram.

587
01:08:26,460 --> 01:08:27,360
Is that the truth?

588
01:08:27,930 --> 01:08:31,700
They said the school had an excursion

589
01:08:33,720 --> 01:08:36,690
and took money from
Grandfather for the tickets.

590
01:08:40,730 --> 01:08:42,010
Ganesan, did you give her money?

591
01:08:54,070 --> 01:08:56,200
Shall we get off at the
next stop and go back?

592
01:08:59,110 --> 01:09:00,700
And if we don't get a bus to go back?

593
01:09:02,580 --> 01:09:04,710
I need to go to the toilet.

594
01:09:05,420 --> 01:09:06,880
Think of something scary!

595
01:09:08,750 --> 01:09:10,220
Will the police catch us?

596
01:09:16,930 --> 01:09:19,900
Why're we going to Rameswaram?
To see whom?

597
01:09:20,630 --> 01:09:21,720
My mother.

598
01:09:24,140 --> 01:09:27,230
Your mother's in Madras.
I saw her on TV yesterday.

599
01:09:28,140 --> 01:09:33,740
That's not my mother.
My real mother's in Rameswaram.

600
01:09:35,280 --> 01:09:39,410
Her name is Shyama. M.D.Shyama.

601
01:10:08,250 --> 01:10:14,120
That is correct.
Shyama, Mankulam village.

602
01:10:14,650 --> 01:10:19,950
Srilanka refugee. April 3rd. 1991.

603
01:10:20,160 --> 01:10:24,460
A baby girl. Normal delivery.

604
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:37,970
Where is she? We came just to see her.

605
01:10:38,540 --> 01:10:42,140
Who knows? Who are you?

606
01:10:43,850 --> 01:10:46,150
What is your name? Your parents' names?

607
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:19,220
Why did you do this?

608
01:11:19,250 --> 01:11:20,770
Don't hit him! He's only a little boy.

609
01:11:20,771 --> 01:11:22,331
Why don't you listen? Stop hitting him!

610
01:11:28,260 --> 01:11:32,030
Aren't you Thiruchelvan?
And Indra? How are you?

611
01:11:32,230 --> 01:11:34,700
Our daughter Amudha came here.
Where is she?

612
01:11:34,900 --> 01:11:40,360
Oh yes, the girl you adopted
I thought as much.

613
01:12:14,270 --> 01:12:15,400
My mother's not here, Pa.

614
01:12:18,780 --> 01:12:21,570
This is your mother. I am your father.

615
01:12:25,720 --> 01:12:26,910
Where's my mother, Pa?

616
01:12:28,520 --> 01:12:30,580
She abandoned you 9 years ago.

617
01:12:31,660 --> 01:12:35,590
She could be anywhere
in the world now. Anywhere.

618
01:12:36,460 --> 01:12:38,260
She could have gone back to Jaffna.

619
01:12:38,460 --> 01:12:40,260
We don't even know if she's alive.

620
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:46,270
Is she dead?

621
01:12:49,410 --> 01:12:53,100
You want to see your mother, don't you?

622
01:12:55,550 --> 01:13:02,610
I'll take you to see her. I promise.

623
01:13:40,530 --> 01:13:44,590
This is the first time, I'm flying.
I'm frightened.

624
01:13:55,870 --> 01:13:58,430
Ah! I'm still alive.

625
01:14:02,550 --> 01:14:04,450
Is this my country?

626
01:14:04,720 --> 01:14:06,210
Is my mother here?

627
01:14:17,560 --> 01:14:23,090
- What does 'Aibhavan' mean?
- It means, 'Greetings' 'Welcome'!

628
01:14:33,910 --> 01:14:38,870
Sankaralingam, Devanathan,
Shanmugadas Welcome!

629
01:14:39,750 --> 01:14:42,380
I'm very happy to meet you
I've read your stories.

630
01:14:42,590 --> 01:14:45,890
- You've come for?
- Personal work.

631
01:14:46,090 --> 01:14:49,550
Stay for our meeting.

632
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:06,410
Vikram. GK sir sent an e-mail
to say you're coming.

633
01:15:10,450 --> 01:15:13,750
I didn't know Indra sir
had such a beautiful wife.

634
01:15:14,620 --> 01:15:17,090
Do all of you talk this way
when you meet a woman?

635
01:15:17,290 --> 01:15:21,090
Only I do and only to you!

636
01:15:21,630 --> 01:15:24,750
And who is this...
even more beautiful?

637
01:15:27,470 --> 01:15:30,590
Dr. Harold Vikramasinghe
GK's friend.

638
01:15:30,970 --> 01:15:32,770
You'll be in my care
as long as you're here.

639
01:15:32,970 --> 01:15:36,930
- So, what d'you want to see?
- My mother.

640
01:15:37,310 --> 01:15:38,610
Here she is.

641
01:15:40,140 --> 01:15:41,610
I want to see M.D.Shyama.

642
01:16:02,330 --> 01:16:03,800
The problem is...

643
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:07,810
...you can never be sure
when a problem will arise!

644
01:16:09,670 --> 01:16:10,970
You speak fluent Tamil?

645
01:16:11,180 --> 01:16:17,480
I know Tamil, Malayalam,
German, French...

646
01:16:17,850 --> 01:16:18,980
...and silence!

647
01:16:19,180 --> 01:16:22,810
Are you a real doctor or a Ph.D
in Geography, Astrology?

648
01:16:23,690 --> 01:16:25,820
A surgeon, Orthopedics.

649
01:16:27,190 --> 01:16:29,490
The knife is real.
The blood is real.

650
01:16:30,360 --> 01:16:31,830
The cries of pain are real.

651
01:16:56,550 --> 01:17:01,510
- Mankulam.
- One is on the way to Kilinochi.

652
01:17:01,890 --> 01:17:05,520
The other I think is beyond Vavuniya.

653
01:17:44,100 --> 01:17:46,100
How can you be so untidy
in someone else's house?

654
01:17:47,270 --> 01:17:48,570
Clear it up.

655
01:17:50,110 --> 01:17:52,580
- Don't throw things!
- I didn't throw them.

656
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:58,740
No talking back, no temper.
Do as your mother tells you.

657
01:18:00,120 --> 01:18:01,080
You're not my mother.

658
01:18:10,460 --> 01:18:14,760
Oh no! Shame, shame!

659
01:18:16,300 --> 01:18:20,260
Amma doesn't like me.
She doesn't like me at all.

660
01:18:37,820 --> 01:18:40,950
Greetings to all who are
present here.

661
01:18:43,330 --> 01:18:45,300
Of the many trivial crimes
in this world...

662
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:51,130
...the worst is to ask a
writer to make a speech.

663
01:18:52,670 --> 01:18:57,470
My wife Indra says that
people read my stories...

664
01:18:57,680 --> 01:18:59,800
...only because I write
under her name!

665
01:19:17,360 --> 01:19:18,420
Are you a Tamilian?

666
01:19:20,030 --> 01:19:20,830
Yes.

667
01:19:24,540 --> 01:19:27,330
- Are you from here?
- Yes.

668
01:19:28,540 --> 01:19:30,170
You know only one word in Tamil?

669
01:19:35,380 --> 01:19:36,660
Aren't you going to the meeting?

670
01:19:37,050 --> 01:19:38,350
- No.
- Why?

671
01:19:39,880 --> 01:19:42,350
- I don't like speeches.
- Neither do I.

672
01:19:44,890 --> 01:19:46,190
That gathering is for my father.

673
01:19:47,890 --> 01:19:48,520
Is that so?

674
01:19:49,060 --> 01:19:50,030
He's a writer.

675
01:19:50,900 --> 01:19:53,690
He's written many stories
under the name, 'Indra'.

676
01:19:54,570 --> 01:19:57,860
- Haven't you read them?
- No, I don't read stories.

677
01:19:58,240 --> 01:20:01,360
Some people say
that writing is a gift.

678
01:20:03,070 --> 01:20:04,870
You must be born with that spark.

679
01:20:07,580 --> 01:20:08,500
That's an absolute lie.

680
01:20:09,080 --> 01:20:12,210
- Where's Amudha?
- In the toilet.

681
01:20:13,080 --> 01:20:14,550
The writer's doing great!

682
01:20:15,250 --> 01:20:19,380
I'm an Engineer. No one else
in the family writes.

683
01:20:23,430 --> 01:20:26,230
- She's not there.
- She was there.

684
01:20:26,760 --> 01:20:34,760
'They had forgotten
that they had faces'.

685
01:20:36,440 --> 01:20:39,070
- What does that mean?
- This is not for you.

686
01:20:39,440 --> 01:20:40,910
My father reads books like this.

687
01:20:41,610 --> 01:20:45,070
My mother reads magazines.

688
01:20:45,950 --> 01:20:47,250
I have two sets of parents.

689
01:20:49,620 --> 01:20:51,420
This mother's name is Indra.

690
01:20:52,790 --> 01:20:55,260
My real mother's name
is M.D.Shyama.

691
01:20:55,960 --> 01:20:57,430
We've come looking for her.

692
01:21:07,810 --> 01:21:09,200
What's your name?

693
01:21:10,740 --> 01:21:12,210
- Amudha.
- And yours?

694
01:21:14,250 --> 01:21:15,580
Where is your mother?

695
01:21:17,310 --> 01:21:19,340
Why is your Tamil strange?

696
01:21:21,150 --> 01:21:22,120
This is Tamil too.

697
01:21:22,650 --> 01:21:24,620
To write well, you need
a good education.

698
01:21:27,320 --> 01:21:29,950
You need to observe events
attentively.

699
01:21:33,500 --> 01:21:36,300
You need to find out if
someone else...

700
01:21:36,500 --> 01:21:39,490
...is going to write your story
better than you.

701
01:21:45,510 --> 01:21:46,980
Where are your parents?

702
01:21:50,010 --> 01:21:51,140
Gone to their village.

703
01:21:52,180 --> 01:21:53,480
Speak clearly.

704
01:22:10,030 --> 01:22:12,330
I told you she'd be here.

705
01:22:16,370 --> 01:22:18,330
How could you go off by
yourself in a new place?

706
01:22:18,380 --> 01:22:20,840
I was talking to him.
He's Tamil.

707
01:22:21,380 --> 01:22:22,500
Is the meeting over?

708
01:22:23,380 --> 01:22:24,680
She's a chatterbox.

709
01:22:27,050 --> 01:22:28,850
She says her mother is here.

710
01:22:30,550 --> 01:22:31,520
So she's told you!

711
01:22:32,390 --> 01:22:34,360
We're going to Mankulam
tomorrow to see her.

712
01:22:41,570 --> 01:22:42,860
If you visit Madras, come home.

713
01:22:44,070 --> 01:22:48,200
Will show you Indra's house.

714
01:22:49,740 --> 01:22:55,370
All stories start from life
and end with it.

715
01:24:01,980 --> 01:24:03,280
Nothing to worry about.

716
01:24:07,480 --> 01:24:10,940
No foreign bodies inside.
No danger, just shock.

717
01:24:12,490 --> 01:24:14,120
She'll have fever for 2 days.

718
01:24:14,490 --> 01:24:19,450
Amudha, we'll go to Mankulam
tomorrow to find your mother.

719
01:24:31,740 --> 01:24:33,710
I didn't give it back, Appa.

720
01:24:39,020 --> 01:24:42,140
Forget about it. Close your
eyes and get some sleep.

721
01:24:45,020 --> 01:24:46,490
I'm scared to close my eyes.

722
01:24:47,520 --> 01:24:49,400
I keep hearing the blasts
over and over again.

723
01:29:06,120 --> 01:29:08,520
Will this bus definitely
go to Mankulam?

724
01:29:22,470 --> 01:29:25,440
He says it's okay.
He'll take you there.

725
01:29:25,970 --> 01:29:27,600
- Will you forget me?
- No.

726
01:29:27,800 --> 01:29:30,100
- You'll marry me when you grow up?
- No.

727
01:29:33,140 --> 01:29:34,900
The army will stop the bus
at a check-post.

728
01:29:34,901 --> 01:29:37,610
If they want your passports
show them.

729
01:29:42,320 --> 01:29:43,280
They know you're coming.

730
01:29:43,281 --> 01:29:46,120
- Don't worry about us.
- I'll try to join you.

731
01:30:13,350 --> 01:30:14,650
Thinking of home?

732
01:30:17,850 --> 01:30:21,650
- Wonder how they are.
- Akhil, Vinay, my father.

733
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:24,160
Don't worry.

734
01:30:25,700 --> 01:30:28,160
We've left two kids behind
for the sake of one.

735
01:30:29,530 --> 01:30:32,990
Is she asleep? If she hears
she'll tear me apart!

736
01:30:34,370 --> 01:30:37,340
Sometimes it's hard to tell
who's mother and who's child!

737
01:30:42,550 --> 01:30:44,830
The army is moving towards Kilinochi.
In half an hour...

738
01:30:44,831 --> 01:30:45,951
...they will shell the area.

739
01:30:45,952 --> 01:30:51,350
Please leave Mankulam
and head eastwards.

740
01:30:51,720 --> 01:30:56,180
Women and children must
proceed to safety.

741
01:30:56,890 --> 01:31:01,190
All are requested to co-operate
with the Army.

742
01:31:30,090 --> 01:31:32,720
- Sundarlingam?
- In the temple.

743
01:31:32,930 --> 01:31:34,730
- Where's it?
- Down east.

744
01:31:42,770 --> 01:31:44,900
Someone's come in search of you.

745
01:31:47,780 --> 01:31:49,380
We've come looking for
Mankulam Shyama.

746
01:31:49,381 --> 01:31:51,580
Yes, the doctor called me.

747
01:31:51,780 --> 01:31:53,250
Let's get out quickly!

748
01:31:54,450 --> 01:31:56,420
Your name?-Thiru.

749
01:31:58,120 --> 01:31:59,360
We want to see Mankulam Shyama.

750
01:31:59,460 --> 01:32:03,760
If you'd come later, you'd not
have seen even Mankulam!

751
01:32:06,800 --> 01:32:09,430
Down this road, third house
on the left.

752
01:32:10,970 --> 01:32:12,940
- Let's go!
- I'm not coming.

753
01:32:13,140 --> 01:32:15,600
Father asked me to fetch you.

754
01:32:15,810 --> 01:32:19,440
Nothing will happen to me.
Ammanchi'll take care of me.

755
01:32:19,640 --> 01:32:22,610
Take them to Shyama.

756
01:32:31,490 --> 01:32:34,090
If they shell the place, there'll
be nothing left. Come with us.

757
01:32:34,290 --> 01:32:35,530
If I go, who'll light the lamp?

758
01:32:35,531 --> 01:32:36,411
Just take them and go!

759
01:32:36,490 --> 01:32:37,290
Go now, all of you!

760
01:32:55,850 --> 01:32:58,640
Farewell my country!

761
01:32:58,850 --> 01:33:02,150
Where the sea washes my front door...

762
01:33:02,850 --> 01:33:06,450
These palm groves
these birds' nests...

763
01:33:06,520 --> 01:33:09,820
Will I ever see them again?

764
01:33:10,030 --> 01:33:13,480
The smiles have died on our lips...

765
01:33:13,700 --> 01:33:16,670
With our souls shrouded.

766
01:33:16,870 --> 01:33:22,500
Only the shells of our bodies
go in weary procession.

767
01:34:06,750 --> 01:34:09,220
That's her, standing there.

768
01:34:11,420 --> 01:34:13,890
Grandpa won't leave the temple.

769
01:34:14,590 --> 01:34:18,550
Shyama, these people have come
from India, looking for you.

770
01:34:21,260 --> 01:34:22,060
Shyama?

771
01:34:22,430 --> 01:34:23,230
Yes.

772
01:34:24,770 --> 01:34:26,760
We've come from Chennai
in search of you.

773
01:34:28,270 --> 01:34:30,500
We've brought you
something priceless.

774
01:34:36,950 --> 01:34:38,570
Your daughter.

775
01:34:44,960 --> 01:34:46,420
Amudha, your mother...

776
01:34:54,970 --> 01:34:56,590
My daughter would have been her age.

777
01:34:58,300 --> 01:34:59,430
This is your daughter too.

778
01:35:00,640 --> 01:35:02,970
No she isn't.

779
01:35:05,140 --> 01:35:05,940
This is your child.

780
01:35:07,810 --> 01:35:09,470
We adopted her.

781
01:35:11,820 --> 01:35:15,620
Mother tell them she's
not my daughter.

782
01:35:24,160 --> 01:35:26,460
Aren't you Mankulam Shyama?

783
01:35:26,830 --> 01:35:31,460
I'm... but I'm not her mother.

784
01:35:43,110 --> 01:35:44,410
All my children are buried...

785
01:35:45,350 --> 01:35:49,810
...under the 'poo arasu' tree
outside the village.

786
01:35:53,860 --> 01:35:57,160
Didn't you go to India and
have a baby in Rameswaram?

787
01:35:59,200 --> 01:36:05,830
I've never left this
village all my life.

788
01:36:06,540 --> 01:36:13,000
But today we're leaving
Mankulam forever.

789
01:36:24,550 --> 01:36:27,020
What's your name?

790
01:38:04,990 --> 01:38:06,990
I heard the Army was moving in
so I came at once.

791
01:38:08,160 --> 01:38:11,790
- Is there another Mankulam?
- Yes, in the North. Let's go.

792
01:38:47,200 --> 01:38:51,500
Aunty, this is Indra, and
this, the original Indra.

793
01:38:53,370 --> 01:38:57,500
This is my aunt.

794
01:39:21,060 --> 01:39:22,860
Your daughter's been on strike
for a week.

795
01:39:23,730 --> 01:39:25,030
She's not talking to me.

796
01:39:28,740 --> 01:39:32,700
Doesn't want me near her.
Bathes and dresses by herself.

797
01:39:33,240 --> 01:39:34,540
I feel like slapping her!

798
01:39:35,410 --> 01:39:36,710
Why get so worked up?

799
01:39:37,750 --> 01:39:42,050
Don't. Am I not justified?

800
01:39:44,920 --> 01:39:46,550
Mother and daughter..
So alike.

801
01:39:49,590 --> 01:39:51,060
One stops and the other starts!

802
01:39:53,430 --> 01:39:55,230
At least, do you love me?

803
01:39:58,770 --> 01:39:59,770
Very much.

804
01:40:10,780 --> 01:40:15,740
I've come. I'm right in the middle!

805
01:40:53,660 --> 01:40:54,780
- Tamil?
- Yes.

806
01:40:55,160 --> 01:40:57,790
- Where's Devanathan's house?
- He's not here.

807
01:40:58,330 --> 01:41:01,300
- Where's his house?
- Ruined! All ruined!

808
01:41:51,380 --> 01:41:53,350
Darling, this is Amma speaking.
How are you?

809
01:41:53,720 --> 01:41:55,180
When are you coming home?

810
01:41:58,720 --> 01:42:01,850
In a couple of days.

811
01:42:02,060 --> 01:42:04,030
No, come back now.

812
01:42:04,730 --> 01:42:07,860
All right, give the phone
to Grandfather.

813
01:42:08,060 --> 01:42:12,020
- Whose Amma are you, mine or hers?
- Yours and hers.

814
01:42:12,570 --> 01:42:14,870
Talk to Amudha now.

815
01:42:15,740 --> 01:42:18,540
Don't want to talk to her.
Don't like her.

816
01:42:24,080 --> 01:42:25,210
I'm sick, I have fever.

817
01:42:26,580 --> 01:42:29,710
He's lying. When d'you
plan to be back?

818
01:42:32,090 --> 01:42:32,710
Soon, Appa.

819
01:42:33,920 --> 01:42:35,720
Akhil wants to talk to you.

820
01:42:38,260 --> 01:42:42,560
Akhil, baby, how are you?

821
01:42:45,600 --> 01:42:48,230
Talk to me... I miss you both so much.

822
01:42:51,440 --> 01:42:56,740
Akhil, don't cry...
I miss you too...

823
01:42:56,950 --> 01:42:58,250
Please don't cry.

824
01:42:59,780 --> 01:43:07,780
I can't bear it.
I love you darling.

825
01:43:09,130 --> 01:43:10,420
I love you, Amma.

826
01:44:18,030 --> 01:44:22,160
Amudha, what happened?

827
01:44:22,370 --> 01:44:24,330
Give her some water...

828
01:44:26,040 --> 01:44:28,500
She must have seen something
that frightened her.

829
01:44:36,710 --> 01:44:41,840
No one wins in guerilla warfare.
But then no one loses either.

830
01:44:43,550 --> 01:44:44,850
It's like prolonged cancer.

831
01:44:55,230 --> 01:44:56,860
Why can't we live peacefully?

832
01:44:58,570 --> 01:44:59,810
The truth is, those who make...

833
01:45:00,400 --> 01:45:06,540
...Kalashnikov rifles, mortars,
grenades, land mines...

834
01:45:06,740 --> 01:45:12,200
...and bombs have a commercial
interest in war.

835
01:45:13,420 --> 01:45:17,050
Developed countries have stopped
fighting, but developing countries...

836
01:45:17,750 --> 01:45:20,880
...use wars as testing grounds
for weapons.

837
01:45:28,430 --> 01:45:30,400
- Is there no end to this?
- There is.

838
01:45:30,930 --> 01:45:34,390
We must dump our weapons in the sea.

839
01:45:34,940 --> 01:45:39,570
Or may be Amudha's generation
will arrive at a solution.

840
01:45:54,620 --> 01:46:02,620
He's from India. He's a
famous Tamil writer.

841
01:46:09,310 --> 01:46:11,430
Indra sir, say something.

842
01:46:16,980 --> 01:46:17,740
Our eyebrows are...

843
01:46:17,741 --> 01:46:22,950
...lowered, our eyes closed
lips parched, teeth clenched...

844
01:46:23,820 --> 01:46:24,790
He's a Tamilian.

845
01:46:25,150 --> 01:46:28,610
We walk with our backs bent.
We whom you rule over...

846
01:46:29,330 --> 01:46:30,950
Lock us up...

847
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:38,800
...in cages, flay us with staves
Let the skin on our backs fester!

848
01:46:39,670 --> 01:46:43,630
One day our eyebrows will arch
our closed eyes open again.

849
01:46:44,340 --> 01:46:48,970
Our puckered lips will throb
and our clenched teeth grind.

850
01:46:49,350 --> 01:46:53,650
Rule over us until then.
Flaunt your power over us!

851
01:47:00,020 --> 01:47:02,990
Yes, I've seen his photograph.
He's the writer, Indra.

852
01:47:04,360 --> 01:47:07,490
- Wait, what's your name?
- Vikram.

853
01:47:08,200 --> 01:47:09,680
- Full name?
- Harold Vikramasinghe.

854
01:47:09,870 --> 01:47:10,830
He's Srilankan.

855
01:47:11,700 --> 01:47:13,830
Move away!

856
01:47:14,700 --> 01:47:16,500
He's the one who brought me here.

857
01:47:18,710 --> 01:47:20,510
Are you mad?

858
01:47:20,710 --> 01:47:24,510
You've entered this area without
permission and with a Srilankan.

859
01:47:24,710 --> 01:47:29,170
He came to help me. He's taking
us to meet a girl named Shyama.

860
01:47:37,060 --> 01:47:38,360
Why are you looking for her?

861
01:47:41,560 --> 01:47:45,360
We've brought her daughter.
We adopted her.

862
01:47:46,570 --> 01:47:47,690
She wants to see her mother.

863
01:47:51,740 --> 01:47:52,870
Do you know Shyama?

864
01:47:58,580 --> 01:47:59,380
Yes, I do.

865
01:47:59,580 --> 01:48:00,550
Can we see her?

866
01:48:06,660 --> 01:48:12,750
We've found your mother.

867
01:48:16,770 --> 01:48:17,890
We've found Amudha's mother.

868
01:48:18,270 --> 01:48:21,070
Was Shyama there?
Did you see her?

869
01:48:21,940 --> 01:48:25,900
I saw her brother. He asked us to
go to the Subramaniam Park.

870
01:48:45,960 --> 01:48:47,930
- Where's Shyama?
- Over there.

871
01:49:50,860 --> 01:49:52,660
People have come from India
looking for you.

872
01:49:53,860 --> 01:49:54,660
Why?

873
01:49:57,870 --> 01:50:00,840
They were seen in Mankulam.

874
01:50:03,370 --> 01:50:08,830
He's a writer and he's come
with his wife and daughter.

875
01:50:13,550 --> 01:50:14,590
The girl is your daughter.

876
01:50:33,900 --> 01:50:35,200
What should I tell them?

877
01:50:44,580 --> 01:50:46,550
I asked them to come to
Subramaniam Park.

878
01:50:51,590 --> 01:50:53,050
I won't see them.

879
01:50:54,420 --> 01:50:55,820
Shyama, she's your daughter.

880
01:51:01,600 --> 01:51:03,330
My children are here.

881
01:51:04,600 --> 01:51:07,900
- Not one or two.
- 300.

882
01:51:57,320 --> 01:52:02,450
She's changed thrice since
morning and looked at the watch...

883
01:52:02,660 --> 01:52:04,130
...at least ten times!

884
01:52:04,490 --> 01:52:05,120
Look!

885
01:53:21,240 --> 01:53:22,640
Maybe she's not coming.

886
01:53:24,240 --> 01:53:27,040
She'll come! She'll definitely come!

887
01:53:53,270 --> 01:53:55,740
'Thambili' -that's tender coconut
water in your country.

888
01:53:58,770 --> 01:54:02,110
Why hasn't she come? Did
you complain about me?

889
01:54:02,280 --> 01:54:03,900
That I argue or fight a lot?

890
01:54:05,950 --> 01:54:10,250
I said only good things.
He said he'd bring her.

891
01:54:28,140 --> 01:54:30,610
The Army's coming, let's go!

892
01:54:33,810 --> 01:54:38,270
No, let's wait for some more time.

893
01:54:40,480 --> 01:54:41,780
We can't stay here, Amudha.

894
01:54:54,330 --> 01:54:57,960
Listen to me... let's go.

895
01:55:00,170 --> 01:55:01,290
Why did you lie to me, Appa?

896
01:55:01,500 --> 01:55:02,800
The Army's here!

897
01:55:05,340 --> 01:55:07,970
Tell them to go away.
Ask her to come.

898
01:55:09,510 --> 01:55:12,110
I won't come with you.

899
01:55:27,200 --> 01:55:35,200
I'm a child... How could
you cheat me?

900
01:58:58,410 --> 01:58:59,410
That was a narrow escape.

901
01:59:18,930 --> 01:59:20,220
Let's go home, Appa.

902
01:59:22,760 --> 01:59:25,730
Let's not stay here.
Let's go.

903
02:00:40,840 --> 02:00:44,140
Can we go through Subramaniam Park?

904
02:00:49,850 --> 02:00:51,980
We heard that the Army went
back only last night.

905
02:00:53,520 --> 02:00:55,080
It doesn't seem wise to
go back there.

906
02:00:58,360 --> 02:01:00,990
No, Amma... You were hurt there.

907
02:01:02,030 --> 02:01:03,330
It was because of me.

908
02:01:05,870 --> 02:01:09,170
We won't get down.
We'll just take a look.

909
02:01:09,870 --> 02:01:13,000
You escaped by a whisker.

910
02:01:18,380 --> 02:01:22,010
Okay, but I won't stop if
I see the Army... I'll go on.

911
02:02:09,100 --> 02:02:09,720
Let's go.

912
02:02:10,770 --> 02:02:13,060
Wait a minute.

913
02:02:55,310 --> 02:02:57,610
My chest hurts.
It's nothing.

914
02:03:40,520 --> 02:03:48,520
Indra sir, the real Indra and Amudha.

915
02:04:01,380 --> 02:04:02,340
Won't you sit down?

916
02:04:35,240 --> 02:04:37,040
Amudha has brought you something.

917
02:04:39,910 --> 02:04:41,880
My album...

918
02:04:45,750 --> 02:04:47,380
It has photographs of me as a child.

919
02:04:50,590 --> 02:04:54,890
It has my poem too. I won
a prize for it.

920
02:04:57,430 --> 02:05:04,400
Photographs with Kamal Hasan,
A.R.Rahman, Grandfather...

921
02:05:05,110 --> 02:05:08,230
...Akhil and Vinay... Won't you
have a look?

922
02:05:20,120 --> 02:05:21,280
Do you have a photo of yours?

923
02:05:35,140 --> 02:05:38,110
She's written down some questions.
She wants to ask you.

924
02:05:48,480 --> 02:05:49,480
Ask her.

925
02:05:58,330 --> 02:06:00,490
Why did you leave me and go away?

926
02:06:22,850 --> 02:06:23,980
The situation was such.

927
02:06:30,530 --> 02:06:32,580
I went on a boat as a refugee.

928
02:06:40,540 --> 02:06:42,330
I was forced to come back.

929
02:06:52,880 --> 02:06:53,850
I had no choice.

930
02:07:13,230 --> 02:07:14,900
Who is my father?

931
02:07:26,080 --> 02:07:27,550
Can I see him?

932
02:07:48,600 --> 02:07:52,440
Did you hold me when I was born?

933
02:07:54,110 --> 02:07:56,080
Did I cry or did I laugh?

934
02:08:02,780 --> 02:08:07,080
They took you away a minute
after you were born.

935
02:08:12,460 --> 02:08:18,090
I touched you once with my finger.

936
02:08:21,800 --> 02:08:23,030
That was all.

937
02:08:56,670 --> 02:08:57,800
You can hold her now.

938
02:10:12,410 --> 02:10:14,880
I didn't want to cry.

939
02:10:20,420 --> 02:10:24,050
Amma, ask her to come with us.
Let's take her to Madras.

940
02:10:26,430 --> 02:10:29,230
You tell her, Appa... she'll
listen to you.

941
02:10:31,430 --> 02:10:34,230
There's no war, no Army in Madras.

942
02:10:35,100 --> 02:10:37,400
We can watch TV and go to the movies.

943
02:10:41,110 --> 02:10:42,080
We can go to the beach.

944
02:10:55,620 --> 02:10:57,090
I have work here.

945
02:10:57,960 --> 02:11:00,430
You can do it later...
Please say yes.

946
02:11:11,140 --> 02:11:14,940
You have brought her up well.
Thank you.

947
02:11:20,650 --> 02:11:26,780
Don't go. Come with us...
or take me with you.

948
02:11:41,500 --> 02:11:44,300
This is your father and
this, your mother.

949
02:11:45,670 --> 02:11:48,300
Don't go, don't...

950
02:11:54,520 --> 02:12:00,980
Someday, there will be peace
in this country.

951
02:12:02,190 --> 02:12:03,160
Come back to me then.

952
02:12:03,360 --> 02:12:04,660
When will that be?

953
02:12:05,530 --> 02:12:08,320
When, Amma? When, Appa?

954
02:12:29,880 --> 02:12:34,010
Don't! If you call out to me
like that, I cannot go.

955
02:12:36,560 --> 02:12:44,560
Amma, come to me once, one last time.

956
02:12:45,070 --> 02:12:48,570
Then you can go.

957
02:12:53,595 --> 02:12:57,595
