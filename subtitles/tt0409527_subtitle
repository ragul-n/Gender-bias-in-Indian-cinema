1
00:01:18,723 --> 00:01:21,191
London, saturday, Nov 14, 1998

2
00:01:33,804 --> 00:01:41,210
And the Booker Prize for this year goes
to Mr. Shaukat vashist for Mindscape.

3
00:01:45,716 --> 00:01:47,206
Spectacular

4
00:01:51,255 --> 00:01:52,222
Outstanding.

5
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:53,618
Ordinary is not for shaukat.

6
00:01:56,394 --> 00:01:58,225
Mindscape! Bold adventures.

7
00:02:06,337 --> 00:02:08,828
Shaukat gives language a new dimension.
- And I myself will change it

8
00:02:17,214 --> 00:02:21,310
You might think I'm joking,
but I have no words to say

9
00:02:22,286 --> 00:02:26,188
Words have got where they had to.
I begin this journey afresh

10
00:02:26,557 --> 00:02:32,189
I will now pen a new saga with words.
I forgot to say... thank you

11
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,868
We will wait for your next book

12
00:02:43,741 --> 00:02:45,868
Mumbai, Wednesday, March 15, 2001

13
00:02:56,921 --> 00:02:58,718
Time stands still.

14
00:02:59,657 --> 00:03:04,151
Lack of experience in shaukat's book.
- Experiences matter. Not more or less

15
00:03:05,696 --> 00:03:08,290
shaukat runs out of words
at a crucial point

16
00:03:08,666 --> 00:03:10,258
That's what I'm saying

17
00:03:10,434 --> 00:03:12,493
It's too far from reality
But it's not a fantasy.

18
00:03:13,771 --> 00:03:14,829
"REAL"

19
00:03:15,005 --> 00:03:17,496
so you tell me what's real!
What is reality?

20
00:03:19,744 --> 00:03:23,339
Words sound hollow because they
aren't related to real-life

21
00:03:23,614 --> 00:03:25,582
We have this habit
of kidding ourselves

22
00:03:26,751 --> 00:03:30,187
I write not for the sake of writing.
I write, so I can live

23
00:03:32,623 --> 00:03:39,187
I will write, keep writing. I will
prove that my characters are not fakes

24
00:03:50,741 --> 00:03:54,199
Lies! Just a pack of lies!

25
00:03:56,247 --> 00:03:57,373
Silence!

26
00:04:12,696 --> 00:04:15,756
I'm ready Antara.
- As usual

27
00:04:17,701 --> 00:04:21,501
shaukat, this evening why don't we...?
- I'm ready to write

28
00:04:22,706 --> 00:04:24,674
A new novel! I see!

29
00:04:25,376 --> 00:04:27,173
Just help it this.

30
00:04:27,444 --> 00:04:29,674
Guess what? At the college...
- It's going to be fun again

31
00:04:29,847 --> 00:04:32,680
I'll once again live and die
with my characters

32
00:04:33,784 --> 00:04:35,752
In an altogether different world

33
00:04:45,629 --> 00:04:47,529
I wish you could experience
the high too

34
00:04:48,599 --> 00:04:50,191
What are you calling it?
And what's the subject?

35
00:04:54,972 --> 00:05:00,205
Look at this! The silly laundryman!
He can't even iron clothes properly!

36
00:05:00,678 --> 00:05:01,645
Ramakant!

37
00:05:02,713 --> 00:05:06,149
Why does this happen, Antara?
No one has any passion for his work!

38
00:05:06,617 --> 00:05:08,141
They'll do anything silly

39
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:13,651
Is a job meant to be just a job...?
- You were telling me about the novel

40
00:05:14,725 --> 00:05:17,694
Don't be afraid. I will
not say anything to Ramakant

41
00:05:18,662 --> 00:05:22,154
In any case, I don't have much to
tell you about the novel today

42
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:26,169
But I'll surely start writing today.
- After two years?

43
00:05:41,719 --> 00:05:45,177
So what must I wear?
You tell me what I should wear!

44
00:05:54,365 --> 00:05:59,200
After two years.
But the beginning will be made today

45
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:21,157
coming, sir!

46
00:06:25,529 --> 00:06:29,158
What's this?
Who has done this?

47
00:06:30,668 --> 00:06:34,160
I have. Looks good, doesn't it?
- Please forgive her, sir

48
00:06:35,205 --> 00:06:37,673
It's her first day at work.
- Why're you asking for forgiveness?

49
00:06:39,376 --> 00:06:42,174
She's my wife. Her mistake
is my mistake

50
00:06:44,214 --> 00:06:48,173
He's right. I'm willing to apologise
too, but what wrong have I done?

51
00:06:48,786 --> 00:06:52,187
She asked me to clean the place,
and I did. So what's wrong with that?

52
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:54,587
She didn't know,
it's her first day at work

53
00:06:54,792 --> 00:06:57,420
The next time there's a mistake...
- There won't be!

54
00:06:57,594 --> 00:06:59,186
But if I could at least know
what wrong I have done?

55
00:07:00,664 --> 00:07:02,131
Actually, Rajni...
- I'll explain!

56
00:07:02,866 --> 00:07:05,630
If someone plants a vessel in
place of a pan on the stove...

57
00:07:06,837 --> 00:07:09,135
and a cooker in place of a pan...
how would you react?

58
00:07:09,773 --> 00:07:10,740
Exactly.

59
00:07:12,977 --> 00:07:15,639
Antara, shut the door
while you go

60
00:07:17,681 --> 00:07:20,149
Rajni, let things be as
they are in the study

61
00:07:20,684 --> 00:07:23,482
Just sweep and mop the floor.
Nothing else. You get that?

62
00:07:24,321 --> 00:07:27,154
You mean I let the mess remain...?
- C'mon

63
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:32,654
When something goes wrong in my
kitchen, I scold even my husband

64
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:40,167
Listen... you scold your husband?
- Yes. If he makes a mistake

65
00:07:45,009 --> 00:07:48,172
And who decides whose
mistake it is?

66
00:07:50,647 --> 00:07:53,343
Good morning, Walrus Publications.
- Can I speak to Mrs. Bose please.

67
00:07:56,220 --> 00:08:00,179
Hi Meera! How're you?
Dissatisfied, as usual...?

68
00:08:00,324 --> 00:08:04,124
This is shaukat vashist here.
I'm starting my next book today

69
00:08:05,329 --> 00:08:07,797
You'll get to know about the subject
when the time arrives, Mrs Bose

70
00:08:08,165 --> 00:08:10,633
I'm not Mrs Bose.
- So where is Mrs Bose?

71
00:08:11,769 --> 00:08:13,737
Mrs Bose is not in
the office right now

72
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:18,308
Mrs. Bose is not in the office.

73
00:08:19,309 --> 00:08:24,474
All right. Tell her that shaukat
had called. She'll be delighted

74
00:08:35,692 --> 00:08:40,652
The goddamned world!
How people change!

75
00:08:44,868 --> 00:08:46,165
Women

76
00:08:51,942 --> 00:08:57,676
Nobody has been able to
understand women. Have I...?

77
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:08,658
This time, I'll write
the story of a woman

78
00:09:10,327 --> 00:09:12,124
Why not.

79
00:09:14,898 --> 00:09:17,628
Her heart, her wishes...

80
00:09:19,903 --> 00:09:22,133
not torn by relationships...

81
00:09:24,174 --> 00:09:29,271
about the woman and her story.
Who is she?

82
00:09:29,713 --> 00:09:31,681
Listen...
- What is it?

83
00:09:31,849 --> 00:09:33,680
Why're you scared?
- I'm not scared!

84
00:09:33,851 --> 00:09:35,546
You've worked here for years
and you're still so scared

85
00:09:35,719 --> 00:09:38,153
He's not going to eat you up!
How'll he write then?

86
00:09:38,722 --> 00:09:43,659
Wait... you don't understand!
- And you've grown old before your time

87
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:49,163
The boss will be angry if
he's disturbed. Stay here

88
00:09:50,701 --> 00:09:54,159
Take this. And remain standing here

89
00:09:59,443 --> 00:10:05,507
A woman... with big,
expressive eyes...

90
00:10:09,453 --> 00:10:12,650
or small, mischievous eyes?

91
00:10:16,693 --> 00:10:20,185
Hair that is all in knots,
or finely combed...?

92
00:10:25,302 --> 00:10:30,205
A serious, straight face?
Or a face with a sparking smile?

93
00:10:40,417 --> 00:10:45,719
From across the seven seas?
Or a desire to go across the seven seas?

94
00:10:48,258 --> 00:10:49,555
Tamanna (Desire)

95
00:11:24,828 --> 00:11:26,193
Hi, Tamanna!

96
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:41,200
I'm shaukat.
Will you go with me?

97
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:46,711
Let's get together and write
your story. Let's see what happens

98
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,219
Tamanna. Nice name

99
00:11:59,796 --> 00:12:06,167
Tamanna, where are you going?
I asked you to go with me...

100
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:10,328
and you're walking far ahead.
Where're you leading me to?

101
00:12:11,408 --> 00:12:14,172
On a new journey...? Great!

102
00:12:14,745 --> 00:12:19,182
Is there something you
want to say to me?

103
00:12:20,884 --> 00:12:26,686
What do you like? Are you happy?
Sad...? Or just plain annoyed?

104
00:12:30,827 --> 00:12:32,522
What do you expect from life?

105
00:12:50,714 --> 00:12:53,706
Ladyfinger, gourd, beans... what are
you going do with so many vegetables?

106
00:12:54,251 --> 00:12:57,220
Don't worry. You won't have to cook.
You can take off

107
00:12:57,487 --> 00:13:00,752
Rajni's not scared of cooking. But
there ought to be someone to eat it

108
00:13:01,325 --> 00:13:03,156
Look at this...

109
00:13:16,707 --> 00:13:19,642
Why haven't you eaten?
- Did I ask you why you're late?

110
00:13:20,744 --> 00:13:22,712
You were checking the exam papers,
I know

111
00:13:23,213 --> 00:13:26,182
Don't you know? I lose all sense
of time when I'm writing?

112
00:13:28,885 --> 00:13:30,716
Will you help me in the kitchen?

113
00:13:45,335 --> 00:13:48,202
I wonder how you get such
nice ideas in your mind

114
00:13:49,373 --> 00:13:52,706
It's so difficult to express freely.

115
00:13:54,244 --> 00:13:57,702
I wouldn't even be able to tell someone
about my own life, if I were asked to

116
00:13:58,982 --> 00:14:01,473
That's because you don't try.
- Try?

117
00:14:01,852 --> 00:14:04,150
No matter what I do, I wouldn't be
able to write a single line

118
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:10,148
And they such nasty things.
- Who're they?

119
00:14:11,194 --> 00:14:12,491
Critics.

120
00:14:13,363 --> 00:14:17,493
I don't know about getting real,
but what you write is really very nice

121
00:14:19,369 --> 00:14:21,337
When they have to write themselves,
they will know...

122
00:14:21,872 --> 00:14:23,840
how difficult it is to
write about real things

123
00:14:25,575 --> 00:14:27,543
Your new book is going
to silence them all

124
00:14:29,379 --> 00:14:31,176
Will it make you happy
if they're silenced?

125
00:14:32,349 --> 00:14:36,183
If you're happy, I'm happy.
- Not my happiness. Talk about yours

126
00:14:37,554 --> 00:14:40,682
What makes you happy?
- Me...?

127
00:14:40,924 --> 00:14:42,357
Yes Antara vashist.

128
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,193
What makes you happy.

129
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:48,527
Cooking.

130
00:14:48,899 --> 00:14:52,198
Don't laugh, answer me
It makes you happy.

131
00:14:52,436 --> 00:14:55,200
I've never thought about it.
- So think now, Antara. Think!

132
00:14:56,406 --> 00:15:00,467
Does cooking give you happiness?
Or prayer...?

133
00:15:02,345 --> 00:15:04,142
Cooking is like a prayer.

134
00:15:05,916 --> 00:15:08,476
Or like a therapy.

135
00:15:10,854 --> 00:15:17,316
Well, have you ever done something
you shouldn't have done?

136
00:15:19,362 --> 00:15:22,331
Yes, several times...
- I don't mean arguments, fights...

137
00:15:22,532 --> 00:15:24,500
or coming home late and so on

138
00:15:24,868 --> 00:15:26,836
something bigger Antara.

139
00:15:29,439 --> 00:15:35,173
Something that has changed your life?
- Life?

140
00:15:35,712 --> 00:15:40,172
Didn't marriage make you regret that
you couldn't do all those things...

141
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:44,652
you might otherwise have done?
- Regret? Marrying you?

142
00:15:44,821 --> 00:15:47,187
Don't you miss your folks
and your father's house?

143
00:15:47,991 --> 00:15:49,856
Don't you want to start all over again.

144
00:15:50,293 --> 00:15:55,196
No. I'm just like
any other girl out there, shaukat...

145
00:15:55,765 --> 00:15:58,199
why're you trying to
look for a story in me?

146
00:16:00,237 --> 00:16:04,799
Don't you feel like looking at yourself
other than from my eyes?

147
00:16:13,683 --> 00:16:18,143
If you met someone who said, there's
no one like you. What would you do?

148
00:16:18,855 --> 00:16:20,823
Has someone said that to you?

149
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:27,161
They're scared, aren't they?
- Who?

150
00:16:28,365 --> 00:16:31,664
Students.
- What does that mean?

151
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:38,171
If I were your student,
I'd give you a rose everyday

152
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:46,513
Hasn't anyone given you a rose so far?
- No. I wouldn't accept, even if he did

153
00:16:47,384 --> 00:16:51,184
Why not?
- Because it's wrong

154
00:16:52,355 --> 00:16:53,322
Why?

155
00:16:56,393 --> 00:16:58,361
Because I'm a lecturer
and they're my students

156
00:16:59,896 --> 00:17:01,295
Wasn't I your lecturer too?

157
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:07,132
That's a different story.
You're elder to me

158
00:17:08,672 --> 00:17:10,640
But what if I were younger?

159
00:17:14,711 --> 00:17:17,145
Then you'd have been
my husband, the professor

160
00:17:17,714 --> 00:17:21,650
Is it wrong to be younger?

161
00:17:25,689 --> 00:17:33,152
No. For me, it's wrong to accept
a rose from anyone other than you

162
00:17:35,932 --> 00:17:38,162
Because I love you very much, shaukat

163
00:17:39,936 --> 00:17:41,904
I love you very much.

164
00:18:10,867 --> 00:18:15,304
Wrong!
Yes... I've found my subject

165
00:18:19,609 --> 00:18:22,134
No, no... it's forbidden

166
00:18:26,716 --> 00:18:31,153
This thing that is forbidden
is going to be my theme

167
00:18:36,192 --> 00:18:38,160
Nobody likes restrictions

168
00:18:42,465 --> 00:18:46,299
And that which is forbidden,
you begin to gradually like

169
00:18:47,537 --> 00:18:50,165
The more you want to give
your relationship a description...

170
00:18:50,473 --> 00:18:52,498
it gets stronger and stronger

171
00:18:54,544 --> 00:18:58,173
Wouldn't you want a relationship like
that one...? Tell me, Tamanna

172
00:18:58,882 --> 00:19:02,784
You'll want a relationship
that sates your hunger

173
00:19:08,692 --> 00:19:10,455
forbidden.

174
00:19:10,827 --> 00:19:14,126
A relationship that someone
else does not accept

175
00:19:25,675 --> 00:19:30,476
The beginning. Two years later

176
00:19:32,382 --> 00:19:35,146
Thanks Tamanna.

177
00:19:46,396 --> 00:19:54,167
"The body is just an excuse"

178
00:19:56,372 --> 00:20:03,175
"It's in soul
that we have to merge"

179
00:20:06,549 --> 00:20:14,183
"Ever since I have held your hand..."

180
00:20:15,692 --> 00:20:23,189
"I feel I hold the reins
of the world"

181
00:21:04,874 --> 00:21:11,177
"A new story of love
is now beginning..."

182
00:21:11,714 --> 00:21:17,675
"all distances are being bridged,
the chasm is vanishing"

183
00:21:25,728 --> 00:21:31,689
"There's something happening
in which words are lost..."

184
00:21:31,935 --> 00:21:36,201
"in the deep meaning of it all"

185
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:29,519
"I have loved you
with all my heart..."

186
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:36,193
"permit me, my love,
that I may go to flounder"

187
00:22:43,706 --> 00:22:48,200
"freeze these moments of love
in time..."

188
00:22:48,378 --> 00:22:53,714
"arrest these moments,
they're about to go by"

189
00:23:35,558 --> 00:23:40,689
"Never before was there so much
of youthfulness in the air..."

190
00:23:42,298 --> 00:23:47,702
"it appears to be
a new world to me"

191
00:23:54,711 --> 00:23:59,205
"There shall be more
of these wonderful times..."

192
00:23:59,382 --> 00:24:05,150
"forever, tugging
at two loving hearts"

193
00:24:19,202 --> 00:24:21,170
They'll give you a fragrance
all day

194
00:24:24,707 --> 00:24:27,676
I hope you have a nice day too.
- I will

195
00:24:28,778 --> 00:24:30,746
The story will surely pick up
tempo today

196
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:39,188
And I will set out
on a strange journey

197
00:24:40,623 --> 00:24:42,181
Wish me luck.

198
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:44,852
All the best.

199
00:24:45,395 --> 00:24:47,659
I'm sure a beginning
will be made today

200
00:24:55,905 --> 00:25:00,205
Tamanna, I've promised Antara that
my story will pick up tempo today

201
00:25:01,344 --> 00:25:04,142
The first twist in my story
is about love

202
00:25:04,847 --> 00:25:09,147
Try loving someone, Tamanna.
The lanes will appear to be like clouds

203
00:25:09,719 --> 00:25:12,153
Here on earth, you will be able
to reach out to the skies

204
00:25:13,189 --> 00:25:16,158
It's time you flew with someone,
Tamanna. You must at least try!

205
00:25:22,698 --> 00:25:24,165
Excuse me.

206
00:25:33,276 --> 00:25:35,836
Close your eyes and the fragrance
disappears. So keep your eyes closed

207
00:25:36,212 --> 00:25:39,181
I'll ask my question later.
- It's okay. What is it?

208
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:41,817
Staff room.

209
00:25:41,984 --> 00:25:44,680
You're a new arrival in the college?
- Yes

210
00:25:45,288 --> 00:25:48,189
Dr Tripathi, the students' counsellor,
is not in the staff room

211
00:25:50,226 --> 00:25:52,194
But where is the staff room?

212
00:25:53,563 --> 00:25:56,191
As I said, you will find
Dr Tripathi in his office

213
00:25:56,899 --> 00:25:59,197
Okay, now miss...
- Antara.

214
00:26:00,903 --> 00:26:03,463
Staff room.

215
00:26:06,175 --> 00:26:08,143
You will find Dr Tripathi
in his office

216
00:26:08,678 --> 00:26:10,145
Gotcha! Gotcha!

217
00:26:12,315 --> 00:26:14,476
Will you marry me.
- What!

218
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:16,217
That's what they say
in such a situation

219
00:26:16,419 --> 00:26:17,477
What's wrong with you.

220
00:26:18,187 --> 00:26:20,485
You jerk, you...

221
00:26:23,926 --> 00:26:25,484
Hi Antara.

222
00:26:27,363 --> 00:26:30,161
What's this...?
One man on another?

223
00:26:30,733 --> 00:26:34,169
No, Ma'am. He's sitting on me.
And I'm a teacher here

224
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:36,338
What? You're a teacher...?

225
00:26:37,607 --> 00:26:39,507
Yash! Photography.

226
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:43,178
Get out of here.

227
00:26:44,213 --> 00:26:46,681
Sorry madam.
It's okay.

228
00:26:48,885 --> 00:26:51,353
Watch out these guys.
Get out from here.

229
00:26:51,721 --> 00:26:53,518
What are you doing here? Get going!

230
00:27:01,898 --> 00:27:03,866
Well come to collage professor Yash.

231
00:27:04,167 --> 00:27:06,465
But how about the staff room...?

232
00:27:16,679 --> 00:27:20,479
I gave you your freedom, didn't I?
And yet, why're you so lonely Tamanna?

233
00:27:21,317 --> 00:27:23,649
What are you afraid of, Tamanna?

234
00:27:27,223 --> 00:27:31,660
There is no bond of relationships.
You are free... absolutely free

235
00:27:32,361 --> 00:27:34,556
There's just no discipline nowadays

236
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:37,631
Hello.
Hi! Miss Kapadia.

237
00:27:37,867 --> 00:27:41,496
A bit to the right, to the left...
Thank you very much.

238
00:27:46,209 --> 00:27:48,177
Sorry for trouble guys.

239
00:27:59,455 --> 00:28:01,355
I'm not a student. I'm a teacher

240
00:28:02,825 --> 00:28:04,122
I'm Bhargava.

241
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:07,124
Let that handshake be.
Your hand is bandaged

242
00:28:07,697 --> 00:28:10,131
My hand has healed long ago.
- So have it cut

243
00:28:10,766 --> 00:28:13,132
Excuse me...?!
- No, the bandage

244
00:28:15,771 --> 00:28:19,138
Old company. I've sort of
fallen in love with it

245
00:28:21,644 --> 00:28:25,307
see how difficult it is?
It takes so much of energy!

246
00:28:27,717 --> 00:28:33,155
Know what? Let's share.
You, your lunch-box. I, my jokes

247
00:28:35,358 --> 00:28:39,158
There used to be a sardar...
won't you laugh?

248
00:28:40,363 --> 00:28:43,161
Why?
- It makes everyone laugh. No...?

249
00:28:45,701 --> 00:28:46,668
One second please.

250
00:28:46,802 --> 00:28:50,169
Mr Bhargav, want to listen to a joke?
- Sure, go ahead!

251
00:28:51,774 --> 00:28:53,173
There was this sardar...

252
00:28:55,711 --> 00:28:57,178
What do you mean he was?

253
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,287
Sorry.

254
00:29:05,488 --> 00:29:07,615
Okay, maybe not a sardar.
How about ourselves?

255
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:12,150
"But we're lecturers,
we mustn't be seen laughing..."

256
00:29:12,828 --> 00:29:14,796
I hope you don't suffer
from those notions?

257
00:29:29,278 --> 00:29:31,644
What are you up to?
- Excuse me?

258
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:37,651
Now tell me, how did the two of you
meet for the first time?

259
00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:43,625
You must've met before your marriage,
isn't it? So how did you meet?

260
00:29:43,793 --> 00:29:46,159
Shouldn't we have met?
- No, that's not...

261
00:29:46,362 --> 00:29:50,162
I know, you don't like me.
You want me to go back

262
00:29:51,367 --> 00:29:54,165
I know, you've tolerated my husband
for years...

263
00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:57,168
and you're now wondering who the
hell is this new chatterbox

264
00:29:58,374 --> 00:29:59,773
Whatever happens,
we've taken the vows

265
00:29:59,942 --> 00:30:03,173
We'll live together
through thick and thin

266
00:30:05,881 --> 00:30:09,180
Why isn't your name Basanti?
- What's wrong with Rajni?

267
00:30:09,819 --> 00:30:13,516
And Rajni's not leaving.
- All I asked is how you met...

268
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:16,187
how you fell in love?
- Love...?

269
00:30:18,661 --> 00:30:21,528
Father said there was a suitor
for me, who lived in the city

270
00:30:21,697 --> 00:30:27,192
I said I wouldn't marry a drunkard. But
father was told, he doesn't even smoke

271
00:30:28,771 --> 00:30:31,205
I had a friend who moved to
Bombay after her marriage

272
00:30:31,374 --> 00:30:33,706
14 people slept together in
a room on the first night

273
00:30:34,410 --> 00:30:37,709
My father said my suitor had a room
of his own. So we got married

274
00:30:40,383 --> 00:30:42,214
Will you have some tea...?
What is it?

275
00:30:42,718 --> 00:30:46,381
Senior Master...?
- Why do you call me senior Master?

276
00:30:46,922 --> 00:30:49,390
Because the junior must
soon be on his way

277
00:30:55,431 --> 00:30:57,228
You talk too much!
- But I only offered him tea

278
00:31:00,002 --> 00:31:02,163
Excuse me Yash.
I mean... sir.

279
00:31:02,605 --> 00:31:05,165
Sir, I wish to join
your classes in photography

280
00:31:05,708 --> 00:31:06,697
Hi, I'm Karishma.

281
00:31:06,909 --> 00:31:13,678
I wished to show you my photographs.
Actually, I'm a student of fine arts

282
00:31:14,383 --> 00:31:18,183
I'll look at all your photographs.
Okay? Bye!

283
00:31:19,889 --> 00:31:23,188
Monday morning, 9 O'clock.
He is so cute.

284
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:33,527
Antara... lovely name!
Who gave you that name?

285
00:31:33,736 --> 00:31:37,194
Must've been your Mom. Only
women can think of such lovely names

286
00:31:37,773 --> 00:31:40,708
Did you have something to say?
- Yes, but I forget what it was

287
00:31:42,912 --> 00:31:45,710
Give me a smile before you leave.
- Why?

288
00:31:46,482 --> 00:31:50,213
I don't know why! Give me a smile,
like you did this morning

289
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:53,220
This is the first time I've had
such a strange request

290
00:31:54,323 --> 00:31:58,692
You've met me for the first time too.
- What meaningless...

291
00:31:58,861 --> 00:32:02,160
so let's laugh because there isn't
anything to laugh about! What say?

292
00:32:02,798 --> 00:32:04,163
Like, there was this sardar...

293
00:32:08,370 --> 00:32:09,337
sorry madam.

294
00:32:30,926 --> 00:32:33,190
Thank you.

295
00:32:43,606 --> 00:32:45,369
I've fallen in love!

296
00:33:09,698 --> 00:33:13,156
Will macaroni and cheese do?
With tomato and parsley!

297
00:33:20,476 --> 00:33:25,175
A new lecturer arrived at the
college today. His name is Yash

298
00:33:26,415 --> 00:33:29,179
from his looks and behaviour, no one can
say whether he's a student or a teacher

299
00:33:29,885 --> 00:33:33,685
I've never seen a lecturer
like him, shaukat

300
00:33:34,356 --> 00:33:38,656
Trendy clothes, a rucksack,
his left hand in a plaster...

301
00:33:38,827 --> 00:33:41,694
his fracture has healed, but he
hasn't taken the bandage off

302
00:33:42,398 --> 00:33:43,524
You should have seen.

303
00:33:43,699 --> 00:33:47,692
What didn't that plaster have!
It was like some kind of artwork!

304
00:33:48,404 --> 00:33:51,532
God!
He tried to make me laugh all day...

305
00:33:52,341 --> 00:33:55,538
Interesting.
- C'mon, What interesting.

306
00:33:55,744 --> 00:34:00,477
He had no shame or inhibitions!
No one has ever screamed "Antara" at me

307
00:34:00,849 --> 00:34:04,148
And that too, from a distance
of 500 meters!

308
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:08,147
He kept yelling away! The insolent!
- Insolent...?

309
00:34:08,891 --> 00:34:14,158
Maybe he's bowled over by you.
- Rubbish, shaukat! Bowled over indeed!

310
00:34:14,897 --> 00:34:17,161
Why can't someone be
bowled over by you?

311
00:34:17,366 --> 00:34:20,494
I'm a married woman. And if he's
still smitten by me...

312
00:34:21,203 --> 00:34:22,500
he's a terribly insolent guy

313
00:34:23,806 --> 00:34:25,171
You are sounding like my mother.

314
00:34:25,674 --> 00:34:28,643
But that's how I am.
You know, shaukat...

315
00:34:29,378 --> 00:34:34,179
ever since I've got married,
I don't like it if anyone...

316
00:34:34,350 --> 00:34:37,183
tries to get intimate with me.
- How'd he know you're married?

317
00:34:37,886 --> 00:34:40,514
He simply took a liking to you.
So how's the poor guy at fault?

318
00:34:40,923 --> 00:34:43,517
All right, the poor guy's
not at fault

319
00:34:44,693 --> 00:34:48,527
I'll clear his misgivings tomorrow
and bring him back to his senses

320
00:34:48,731 --> 00:34:55,193
Instead of bring him back to his
senses, why don't you befriend him?

321
00:34:56,705 --> 00:35:00,471
You're scared like Tamanna.
It's just a friendship, Antara

322
00:35:02,711 --> 00:35:04,474
No.
- Why not?

323
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:07,148
I don't like the idea.
- How about another?

324
00:35:08,350 --> 00:35:10,875
I don't need to make friends
with another man

325
00:35:11,387 --> 00:35:14,481
Is it because you're married?
- It's because I'm happy with my life

326
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:17,315
That's because you haven't lived
life any other way

327
00:35:18,394 --> 00:35:22,160
You haven't called out to anyone from
one end of the corridor to the other

328
00:35:23,399 --> 00:35:25,890
Because you consider all that wrong.
Only because you're married

329
00:35:27,269 --> 00:35:30,670
Meet people with an open mind, Antara.
And see what happens

330
00:35:32,875 --> 00:35:35,343
You're scared, aren't you?
- Of whom?

331
00:35:35,878 --> 00:35:38,176
You're afraid Yash will make
you do things...

332
00:35:38,881 --> 00:35:41,179
Mrs shaukat vashist
shouldn't be doing

333
00:35:45,387 --> 00:35:48,185
Let go Antara.
Let go.

334
00:35:50,759 --> 00:35:54,195
You're in love with me, aren't you?
- Don't you believe that?

335
00:35:55,464 --> 00:35:57,864
I do, but maybe you don't.
Because you're afraid

336
00:35:58,934 --> 00:36:04,304
Of falling in love.
- That will never happen

337
00:36:05,874 --> 00:36:09,139
If you keep running away from people,
it'll never happen

338
00:36:10,646 --> 00:36:17,142
But the real test is to meet people,
mingle with them... and prove it

339
00:36:22,858 --> 00:36:24,485
Help me out Antara.

340
00:36:24,693 --> 00:36:27,321
I'm writing the story of a woman,
and I'm up against a dead-end

341
00:36:28,530 --> 00:36:30,498
I need a bit of support

342
00:36:37,272 --> 00:36:39,240
I've got to go to my class.

343
00:36:40,209 --> 00:36:43,178
If Lalaji had seen you laugh, he'd
have been amused at his foolishness

344
00:36:43,979 --> 00:36:48,507
If I keep laughing at Lalaji's antics,
the students will laugh at me

345
00:36:48,751 --> 00:36:52,187
They won't have any respect for me.
- You're a fashion teacher...

346
00:36:52,821 --> 00:36:54,789
all this stuff about respect
is meant for the archives

347
00:36:55,724 --> 00:36:59,182
Being punctual is respectful, right?
- There you are. The perfect teacher!

348
00:36:59,762 --> 00:37:00,660
Later.

349
00:37:14,276 --> 00:37:17,268
Laughter. How would
Tamanna's laughter be?

350
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:27,148
What sort of laughter...?

351
00:37:29,191 --> 00:37:37,155
A sparkling laughter.
What makes you laugh so much, Tamanna?

352
00:37:39,768 --> 00:37:41,736
Is someone making you laugh?

353
00:37:48,343 --> 00:37:50,174
Who is he?

354
00:37:52,214 --> 00:37:55,183
So you've found someone?
Who is he, Tamanna?

355
00:38:00,622 --> 00:38:03,455
You never let me see your face.
At least show me his

356
00:38:11,333 --> 00:38:14,131
Hi, Yash.
I'm shaukat

357
00:38:16,338 --> 00:38:17,805
Welcome to shaukat's world.

358
00:38:18,173 --> 00:38:21,802
Everything here is decided by shaukat.
You'll only be going through the motions

359
00:38:22,711 --> 00:38:26,147
Everything's for real.
Because real is what they want

360
00:38:26,715 --> 00:38:30,651
so you really exist.
In shaukat's story

361
00:38:31,653 --> 00:38:35,145
Not just in Antara's life, you will
also be part of my story henceforth

362
00:38:41,196 --> 00:38:43,164
How do you find Tamanna?

363
00:38:44,666 --> 00:38:46,634
Coffee.
- Thank you.

364
00:38:48,871 --> 00:38:51,169
Looks like I'll have to pay
your mother a visit soon

365
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:54,174
I've been eating the food she cooks
and haven't even thanked her

366
00:38:54,676 --> 00:38:56,507
It's not fair.

367
00:38:56,712 --> 00:39:00,773
When can I drop in to say thanks?
By the way, don't you cook?

368
00:39:02,217 --> 00:39:06,119
My mother doesn't cook either.
It's Rajni, my maid. She cooks for us

369
00:39:08,657 --> 00:39:10,124
Where's your mother...?

370
00:39:11,193 --> 00:39:14,253
Mother! Where are you?

371
00:39:16,164 --> 00:39:18,132
My mother's very far away

372
00:39:19,701 --> 00:39:21,464
I'm glad she's far away!

373
00:39:21,837 --> 00:39:24,135
She's always asking me to get married.
- So get married

374
00:39:27,175 --> 00:39:29,143
Good God!
- What happened?

375
00:39:29,511 --> 00:39:34,471
My landlady's daughter!
The landlady has a crush on me!

376
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:42,156
Mother sent this. She said it's not
nice for you to ask someone for food

377
00:39:42,858 --> 00:39:47,659
sorry, I'll ask her for the food today.
Maybe tomorrow. Okay?

378
00:39:47,829 --> 00:39:49,660
Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

379
00:39:49,865 --> 00:39:53,665
And tell your mother not to worry
about me. I've grown up now

380
00:39:56,705 --> 00:39:59,674
Bye.
- Bye.

381
00:40:04,947 --> 00:40:08,178
What's wrong with her?
- I like someone else

382
00:40:08,917 --> 00:40:10,509
Her hair...

383
00:40:11,954 --> 00:40:16,186
short, this much. She has very
mischievous eyes...

384
00:40:17,726 --> 00:40:21,184
they're always conveying something.
She's still very child-like...

385
00:40:21,663 --> 00:40:23,528
and it shows every now and then

386
00:40:23,732 --> 00:40:29,693
I feel like just looking at her...
just looking at her...

387
00:40:30,238 --> 00:40:32,706
What else?
- What else? She just can't laugh!

388
00:40:32,941 --> 00:40:36,707
When she laughs, it sounds as if
she's splashing a pail of water!

389
00:40:39,247 --> 00:40:41,215
Can you think of a girl like that?

390
00:40:44,252 --> 00:40:46,220
Yash, today is your lucky day.

391
00:40:46,655 --> 00:40:48,885
Want me to tell you a joke?
- Joke...? Ofcourse.

392
00:40:51,727 --> 00:40:53,695
There was this sardar...
- There was this sardar...

393
00:40:54,429 --> 00:40:56,397
Okay, Lalaji...

394
00:41:02,371 --> 00:41:04,339
If the very idea of a joke
can make you laugh so much...

395
00:41:05,374 --> 00:41:10,175
which idiot wants to listen to a joke?
It's your laughter I'm interested in

396
00:41:27,763 --> 00:41:30,527
You're falling in love.
You are, Yash...

397
00:41:31,233 --> 00:41:34,202
you must! The story has
to move further, you see?

398
00:41:34,736 --> 00:41:37,204
Guess how Lalaji ties
his laces, Antara?

399
00:41:37,572 --> 00:41:39,369
Check this out.

400
00:41:42,411 --> 00:41:44,379
Very funny.

401
00:41:44,646 --> 00:41:48,582
Can't you do without laughing loudly?
I'm checking the papers!

402
00:41:49,451 --> 00:41:51,419
Sorry, hope we didn't disturb you?
- Yes, you did.

403
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:54,288
I didn't expect this from you, Antara

404
00:41:54,523 --> 00:41:57,219
They can hear you laughing
out there in the corridor!

405
00:41:58,760 --> 00:41:59,886
Oh my God.

406
00:42:00,862 --> 00:42:02,830
Sorry sir.
- It's okay.

407
00:42:03,398 --> 00:42:05,161
Antara, she is right.

408
00:42:06,568 --> 00:42:08,160
Antara, what did you eat
for breakfast...

409
00:42:08,370 --> 00:42:10,167
that you can be heard laughing
at the end of the corridor?

410
00:42:10,372 --> 00:42:15,173
It's your joke that's special, Yash.
We never heard her laughing like that

411
00:42:15,377 --> 00:42:16,344
Am I right, Mr Bose?

412
00:42:16,545 --> 00:42:18,513
Oh my God, Miss. Kapadia.
You are only too fair.

413
00:42:18,747 --> 00:42:22,183
You give all the credit only to
the one who makes her laugh. Right?

414
00:42:22,384 --> 00:42:25,182
Where are you going?
- Home. I'm done

415
00:42:25,387 --> 00:42:29,187
I've got just one class to go.
...I'll join you, too!

416
00:42:39,234 --> 00:42:41,702
Can't be helped.
One has to go home

417
00:42:42,771 --> 00:42:46,207
I hate going alone.
And today...? No way

418
00:42:46,575 --> 00:42:49,203
Mrs Kapadia, how many classes
have you to take?

419
00:42:49,444 --> 00:42:52,208
Why?
- I'm very depressed today

420
00:42:53,315 --> 00:42:56,216
The plaster's been taking off my
arm. But the pain isn't in the arm

421
00:42:59,421 --> 00:43:01,480
It's in my heart
I'm sorry.

422
00:43:01,723 --> 00:43:03,486
Shall we go?

423
00:43:04,893 --> 00:43:06,485
Naughty boy.

424
00:43:26,214 --> 00:43:28,682
I knew it.

425
00:43:29,217 --> 00:43:30,844
There was this sardarji who...

426
00:43:31,219 --> 00:43:33,517
Yash replaces sardarji's with Lalaji's
in his jokes, and makes them all up!

427
00:43:35,757 --> 00:43:37,190
Very talented...

428
00:43:38,793 --> 00:43:42,194
I'm not kidding. It's not easy
to make up jokes

429
00:43:43,331 --> 00:43:47,199
His jokes are so stupid!
And yet, I feel like laughing...

430
00:43:48,236 --> 00:43:52,195
and I feel embarrassed later.
- Why? 5315

431
00:43:53,742 --> 00:43:55,710
Have you ever heard me
guffawing away?

432
00:43:56,411 --> 00:43:59,209
And Mrs Kapadia...? She keeps
glaring at me...

433
00:43:59,581 --> 00:44:03,142
and she even takes digs at me.
This chap Yash, he's such a...

434
00:44:04,553 --> 00:44:07,317
But the girls in the college
are absolutely crazy about him

435
00:44:08,690 --> 00:44:10,157
How about him?

436
00:44:12,594 --> 00:44:15,154
He was telling me today
what sort of a girl he'd like

437
00:44:15,530 --> 00:44:17,498
What sort? Like you?

438
00:44:19,201 --> 00:44:21,169
Just the opposite

439
00:44:22,704 --> 00:44:28,165
I thought I must tell him then
that I'm a married woman

440
00:44:28,877 --> 00:44:30,174
Why?

441
00:44:36,351 --> 00:44:40,685
Didn't you say he likes girls who are
just the opposite of you?

442
00:44:43,291 --> 00:44:46,192
Yes, but Mrs Kapadia...
- Who the hell is Mrs Kapadia?

443
00:44:46,895 --> 00:44:50,194
I know better. I'm glad
you didn't tell him

444
00:44:50,932 --> 00:44:55,198
If you told him you're married,
his behaviour would've changed

445
00:44:56,404 --> 00:44:58,872
Relax Antara.
Just relax.

446
00:45:14,689 --> 00:45:17,658
There will be discomfort.
Forbidden territory, after all

447
00:45:18,693 --> 00:45:22,652
But don't care. It's not time yet
to tell Yash the truth

448
00:45:24,366 --> 00:45:26,493
I'll tell you
when to tell him

449
00:45:32,941 --> 00:45:35,671
Happy Rose Day Antara.
- What nonsense Yash.

450
00:45:36,378 --> 00:45:41,680
We're not students...
- What's going on here with the roses?

451
00:45:42,217 --> 00:45:44,185
Why don't they simply rename India
as America?

452
00:45:44,352 --> 00:45:45,649
Such nonsense I tell you.

453
00:45:45,820 --> 00:45:47,685
They don't care for seniors
or elders...

454
00:45:47,889 --> 00:45:50,517
I'm told a student has
given you a rose, Yash?

455
00:45:50,725 --> 00:45:53,193
Not one. 15. I can't figure out
who to give the roses to

456
00:45:54,629 --> 00:45:58,690
That's the problem with this generation!
They know nothing about values and morals

457
00:45:59,234 --> 00:46:00,462
Excuse me.
- Yes

458
00:46:00,669 --> 00:46:02,466
Happy Rose Day.

459
00:46:04,839 --> 00:46:06,466
Such nonsense.

460
00:46:09,344 --> 00:46:11,141
You want one more.

461
00:46:13,682 --> 00:46:17,140
Capture every moment, Yash.
Let nothing of it go away

462
00:46:18,887 --> 00:46:22,152
Antara, give me a smile! Please!
- Yash! The things you do!

463
00:46:24,559 --> 00:46:26,151
I was capturing it for memory.
- Stop it now

464
00:46:26,661 --> 00:46:28,652
Yash can't be stopped anymore

465
00:46:29,364 --> 00:46:32,162
He has found what he has been
looking for, all his life

466
00:46:35,303 --> 00:46:38,170
This face...
- What?

467
00:46:40,375 --> 00:46:41,672
I'm capturing it for memory

468
00:46:44,279 --> 00:46:49,182
Yash is captivated. In his love for
Tamanna. As for my story...

469
00:46:52,887 --> 00:46:57,688
I'm not lying, but you won't believe it
unless you meet him in person

470
00:46:58,727 --> 00:47:00,627
I want to meet him too

471
00:47:02,831 --> 00:47:06,130
fire... provides light

472
00:47:07,702 --> 00:47:09,670
chaos. Mayhem

473
00:47:14,676 --> 00:47:17,304
fire, smoke...

474
00:47:18,446 --> 00:47:21,472
together, everywhere

475
00:47:22,350 --> 00:47:25,148
Noisy, silent...

476
00:47:26,388 --> 00:47:27,355
who are you?

477
00:47:27,555 --> 00:47:35,519
"I'm a stranger to myself,
I know not who I am"

478
00:47:36,931 --> 00:47:39,491
"Deeper than pain,
higher than the skies..."

479
00:47:40,702 --> 00:47:44,160
"the pure white of love,
your features..."

480
00:47:45,206 --> 00:47:46,503
"I imagine somewhat hazily"

481
00:47:46,708 --> 00:47:52,510
"I'm a stranger to myself,
I know not who I am"

482
00:47:53,381 --> 00:47:59,513
"What do your eyes make of me?
Do please tell me"

483
00:48:29,350 --> 00:48:31,648
"Eyes..."

484
00:48:31,853 --> 00:48:35,653
"What's in the eyes?
- A face"

485
00:48:36,357 --> 00:48:41,659
"Whose face?
- Ask your heart"

486
00:48:44,699 --> 00:48:49,159
"I was lost in the
maze of the world"

487
00:48:49,370 --> 00:48:54,171
"Ever since I met you,
I found myself lost in your eyes"

488
00:49:16,731 --> 00:49:22,135
I've given you a name.
I'm now giving you a face

489
00:49:23,538 --> 00:49:28,134
"Innocent-eyed, a naive-looking
face. Smiling lips"

490
00:49:29,444 --> 00:49:32,140
"Are you just a word,
or the truth...?"

491
00:49:32,747 --> 00:49:34,715
"Or are you a
complicated question?"

492
00:49:35,650 --> 00:49:37,618
"Right now, you're just
a figment of my imagination"

493
00:49:38,419 --> 00:49:41,479
"What's up?
- What's up..."

494
00:49:41,723 --> 00:49:44,157
"I wonder what excitement this is"

495
00:49:44,425 --> 00:49:48,156
"There's a change...
- Ever since you've arrived"

496
00:49:49,197 --> 00:49:53,156
"say nothing...
- Why mustn't I?"

497
00:49:54,269 --> 00:49:58,638
"I'm afraid, I might be lost
in the embrace of your words"

498
00:50:14,455 --> 00:50:18,687
I imagine a picture of you,
a picture very colourful...

499
00:50:19,894 --> 00:50:22,192
resplendent with the
glorious colours of spring...

500
00:50:22,463 --> 00:50:25,694
of your victory...
of my defeat

501
00:50:27,235 --> 00:50:31,194
Of denial, of waiting,
of requittal, of petty tiffs...

502
00:50:32,307 --> 00:50:34,207
and a faint colour of love

503
00:50:34,409 --> 00:50:37,207
"What are you all about?
- You tell me..."

504
00:50:37,645 --> 00:50:41,672
"what have you learnt about me?
- I've learnt that you..."

505
00:50:41,849 --> 00:50:44,716
"I'm so thrilled you've
learnt something about me"

506
00:50:44,919 --> 00:50:49,219
"Tell me now, will you?
- Don't bother me like this"

507
00:50:49,924 --> 00:50:54,224
"We might end up doing
the unimaginable"

508
00:51:17,418 --> 00:51:21,184
"Your simplicity is priceless.
Your character is impeccable"

509
00:51:22,690 --> 00:51:24,521
"Whatever you are,
you are beyond compare"

510
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:28,729
"Are you a question
or are you a thought?"

511
00:51:30,298 --> 00:51:34,200
"Anyone who meets you
is bound to fall in love with you"

512
00:51:41,442 --> 00:51:42,409
Tea

513
00:52:24,385 --> 00:52:28,185
You guys don't want to go home?
Go on! Move it now!

514
00:52:34,729 --> 00:52:36,253
Excuse me.
- Yes sir.

515
00:52:36,497 --> 00:52:41,196
Antara vashist, the professor...?
- Oh yes, she's a wonderful lady!

516
00:52:41,402 --> 00:52:43,370
But she left during the lunch-break

517
00:52:44,338 --> 00:52:48,707
Is it something special? I'll give
her the message. Sure, I will

518
00:52:50,411 --> 00:52:52,379
Excuse me.
We know each other.

519
00:52:52,947 --> 00:52:55,211
No.
- Yes we do.

520
00:52:57,418 --> 00:53:00,216
You're shaukat, aren't you?
I'm a huge fan of yours!

521
00:53:00,455 --> 00:53:02,821
The other day, when your programme
appeared on tv...

522
00:53:03,191 --> 00:53:06,649
my God! Antara has already left!
Hasn't she gotten home yet?

523
00:53:07,662 --> 00:53:10,153
I'm Mrs Kapadia.
- Nice meeting you

524
00:53:10,531 --> 00:53:13,159
I loved that novel of yours...

525
00:53:13,367 --> 00:53:19,169
Maybe some people didn't like it,
but I really loved it

526
00:53:19,373 --> 00:53:21,341
Thank you.

527
00:53:26,681 --> 00:53:28,649
Come on, come on...
What are you guys doing over here?

528
00:53:37,825 --> 00:53:39,190
Excuse me.

529
00:53:41,562 --> 00:53:47,194
Yash... the new professor...
- Oh yes, strong boy, I say!

530
00:53:47,735 --> 00:53:53,537
What does he do all day...?
He went away in the evening

531
00:53:53,775 --> 00:53:57,677
He takes class. In the amphitheater
over there. Photography classes

532
00:53:57,845 --> 00:53:59,870
Is there something to say to him?
- No...

533
00:54:00,248 --> 00:54:02,148
I'll tell him...
- No, there's nothing. Go on

534
00:54:56,304 --> 00:55:00,468
Exactly as I had imagined!
Brilliant shaukat.

535
00:55:28,202 --> 00:55:30,170
You...?
- Hi

536
00:55:31,639 --> 00:55:33,607
for the first time, you weren't
at home when I returned

537
00:55:37,211 --> 00:55:41,170
Where are Rajni and Ramakant?
- They were here till lunch-time

538
00:55:41,749 --> 00:55:45,185
You were coming for lunch, weren't you?
- Yes, but...

539
00:55:45,386 --> 00:55:47,513
Extra-classes.
- Yes

540
00:55:47,788 --> 00:55:50,188
I knew it.
- What?

541
00:55:51,359 --> 00:55:53,190
That you'd be late

542
00:55:55,696 --> 00:55:59,188
Women...! Antara, this is
the first time you've lied to me

543
00:55:59,734 --> 00:56:02,134
And Tamanna will lie to me tomorrow.
But I'm not letting that happen

544
00:56:02,837 --> 00:56:05,635
Henceforth, I'm going to decide
what's going to happen. I will!

545
00:56:08,175 --> 00:56:10,143
Mr. Bhargav, one minute.
I'll just join you.

546
00:56:11,679 --> 00:56:13,306
Hi, Anatara.
- Hi.

547
00:56:13,514 --> 00:56:16,642
Well, well, your husband's nowadays
coming to pick you up...?

548
00:56:16,851 --> 00:56:19,149
What?
- Yes, he was here yesterday...

549
00:56:19,353 --> 00:56:22,481
but you weren't here at all!
Poor guy, he look so sad.

550
00:56:22,857 --> 00:56:26,156
But my wish was fulfilled.
Oh yes, it was

551
00:56:26,727 --> 00:56:30,163
I thought I'd introduce him to Yash,
but he wasn't around either

552
00:56:30,731 --> 00:56:32,562
What a guy, your husband.

553
00:56:32,767 --> 00:56:35,167
Keep an eye on him, okay? Or you'll
have problems with the other girls

554
00:56:36,604 --> 00:56:38,663
Oh yes, I'm coming Mr Bose!

555
00:56:44,879 --> 00:56:48,178
Hi, thinking about me, weren't you?
- Good morning, Yash

556
00:56:51,752 --> 00:56:53,515
Good morning.

557
00:56:57,959 --> 00:57:00,792
Did you go to the college
to pick me up yesterday?

558
00:57:03,664 --> 00:57:09,125
Shaukat, did you...
- I knew Mrs Kapadia would tell you

559
00:57:10,838 --> 00:57:15,138
Are you afraid? Afraid that
Yash might...

560
00:57:15,509 --> 00:57:17,477
Exactly.
- Don't turn around!

561
00:57:19,513 --> 00:57:22,641
If Yash falls in love with you,
how are you to blame?

562
00:57:24,719 --> 00:57:27,654
But I shouldn't be lying to him.
- Where have you lied to him?

563
00:57:28,889 --> 00:57:31,289
Did he ever ask you
if you were married?

564
00:57:32,727 --> 00:57:36,163
No one asks a question like that.
- Beautiful

565
00:57:36,697 --> 00:57:39,165
What...?
- Very nice

566
00:57:48,876 --> 00:57:53,176
Now tell me what you want.
You want Yash to know the truth?

567
00:57:53,781 --> 00:57:56,181
Will you like it if your
friendship with him ends?

568
00:58:02,857 --> 00:58:05,291
A friendship must never be based
on a foundation of falsehood

569
00:58:09,630 --> 00:58:13,122
What is it about the friendship
that really appeals to you?

570
00:58:16,504 --> 00:58:17,801
You can tell me.

571
00:58:22,743 --> 00:58:24,802
I've started doing things
I had given up

572
00:58:25,379 --> 00:58:33,150
Like laughing over small things,
getting together and chatting away...

573
00:58:33,521 --> 00:58:35,489
and those small...
- challenges?

574
00:58:36,357 --> 00:58:38,154
Yes, challenges

575
00:58:38,592 --> 00:58:41,152
Like who can snap his fingers more
in a minute...

576
00:58:41,328 --> 00:58:43,489
or who can sit without blinking
for a longer time...

577
00:58:43,731 --> 00:58:48,168
stupid things like that.
Childish things I've begun to like

578
00:58:52,706 --> 00:58:56,506
However... I'm not in love with him

579
00:58:59,380 --> 00:59:01,109
You know that.

580
00:59:03,651 --> 00:59:06,119
You are the one I love

581
00:59:09,423 --> 00:59:10,390
so why are you afraid?

582
00:59:16,664 --> 00:59:19,462
Don't be afraid, Antara.
My story will come to a standstill

583
00:59:22,703 --> 00:59:24,671
I'll set everything right

584
00:59:30,244 --> 00:59:31,802
Antara, call for you

585
00:59:34,515 --> 00:59:36,483
Antara... call for you

586
00:59:52,867 --> 00:59:55,836
What were you doing?
Not thinking about me, were you?

587
00:59:56,203 --> 00:59:59,832
No, I was getting a haircut.
- Small cut...?

588
01:00:02,376 --> 01:00:05,504
Why've you called?
- We're watching a play...

589
01:00:05,713 --> 01:00:09,171
at the Habitat centre.
- Play? No...

590
01:00:09,383 --> 01:00:13,683
I don't go anywhere on sundays.
- What nonsense, Antara! Why not?

591
01:00:15,222 --> 01:00:17,850
First tell me who picked up the phone.
Tell me, go on!

592
01:00:19,226 --> 01:00:22,684
He had such a heavy voice...
- Go on! Go, Antara!

593
01:00:25,766 --> 01:00:28,200
What play is this?
- Why aren't you telling me?

594
01:00:28,836 --> 01:00:32,533
I get it! You don't want to tell me.
"Antara, call for you"

595
01:00:33,974 --> 01:00:37,205
I was scared. You never told me
your Papa lives with you

596
01:00:37,411 --> 01:00:40,209
At what time?
- The play begins at 7

597
01:00:42,983 --> 01:00:45,213
But we can meet right now,
if you wish

598
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:49,356
Okay. At 6:30 then

599
01:00:49,924 --> 01:00:53,690
can you come to the Habitat centre?
- All right

600
01:00:53,861 --> 01:00:57,228
I can even come and pick you up...
- No, no. That's not necessary...

601
01:00:57,998 --> 01:00:59,966
I'll get there on my own

602
01:01:00,935 --> 01:01:05,338
Yes, It's okay.
Okay, bye.

603
01:01:13,547 --> 01:01:17,677
You must go with him.
Because I want you to

604
01:01:18,752 --> 01:01:24,190
Take care how you dress, Tamanna.
Today's a special day

605
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:27,188
Beautiful.

606
01:01:34,902 --> 01:01:37,530
In just a moment, you make
me feel so much younger

607
01:01:40,407 --> 01:01:44,366
What spell is this...? I fall
in love with you again and again

608
01:01:49,416 --> 01:01:51,213
There's just one thing missing

609
01:02:35,663 --> 01:02:37,187
It's just perfect now

610
01:02:39,733 --> 01:02:41,200
I'm very selfish, isn't it?

611
01:02:43,771 --> 01:02:48,208
If you go out looking like this,
I'll eagerly wait for you to return

612
01:02:50,778 --> 01:02:54,214
Go on. Aren't you getting
late for the play?

613
01:03:00,321 --> 01:03:01,288
Go, Antara

614
01:03:07,628 --> 01:03:11,496
You want me to give you an idea, Yash?
Don't take Tamanna to the play today

615
01:03:12,533 --> 01:03:14,501
Let's see how things unfold

616
01:03:16,337 --> 01:03:18,737
Weren't we supposed to see a play?
What place have you brought me to?

617
01:03:18,939 --> 01:03:22,170
This is the inevitable place two
people walking together arrive at

618
01:03:22,876 --> 01:03:25,674
since when are we walking together?
- Ever since I've met you...

619
01:03:25,879 --> 01:03:30,179
I've been trying to keep in step.
But you're forever ahead or trailing

620
01:03:31,018 --> 01:03:32,178
Are you scared of your folks?

621
01:03:33,887 --> 01:03:36,185
Sorry, but why must you be angry?
What mistake have I made?

622
01:03:36,757 --> 01:03:39,191
You must've been bored arranging
the clothes in the wardrobe...

623
01:03:39,393 --> 01:03:43,693
I'm only keeping you entertained!
Mother's right

624
01:03:44,898 --> 01:03:47,196
Good deeds aren't meant
for these sinful times

625
01:03:49,737 --> 01:03:54,197
You talk so much, Yash, one never
knows where you start and where you end

626
01:03:54,408 --> 01:03:58,708
You know Antara? You are right.
The world is round.

627
01:03:59,413 --> 01:04:02,143
Go where you want to,
you'll return to the same place

628
01:04:03,417 --> 01:04:05,385
Why're you wearing that ugly look?

629
01:04:06,253 --> 01:04:08,153
Because I'm not feeling like
laughing at what you're saying

630
01:04:08,522 --> 01:04:10,490
All right, let me try
something else

631
01:04:10,691 --> 01:04:14,650
If I don't make you laugh by the
time we get there, my name...

632
01:04:15,262 --> 01:04:17,230
sorry, I'll take a ride up there!

633
01:04:18,332 --> 01:04:20,493
What sort of a joke is this, Yash?
- Laugh, if you think it's a joke!

634
01:04:21,435 --> 01:04:25,166
Okay, Lalaji and Laliji once arrived...
- I'm going home

635
01:04:25,372 --> 01:04:26,839
Lalaji said to Laliji...

636
01:04:28,976 --> 01:04:33,174
"What will you give me if I reach
the peak of that mountain?"

637
01:04:33,414 --> 01:04:34,506
This is not funny.

638
01:04:35,649 --> 01:04:39,676
Laliji was a bit shy.
Lalaji again asked her...

639
01:04:40,888 --> 01:04:44,187
"what will you give me if
I make it to that peak?"

640
01:04:45,325 --> 01:04:47,691
Guess what Laliji said?
She said...

641
01:04:49,763 --> 01:04:50,855
A push!

642
01:06:14,314 --> 01:06:16,282
Should I make dinner
for the lady?

643
01:06:31,698 --> 01:06:36,499
What happened?
- How did she leave him alone like this?

644
01:06:51,885 --> 01:06:55,184
He'll leave water all over the place!
And we can't even stop him

645
01:07:17,344 --> 01:07:22,145
Take off this blindfold, Yash.
- My eyes are open. Trust me

646
01:07:23,884 --> 01:07:29,151
Ask her whatever you want to.
Damayanti knows everything. Sit down

647
01:07:29,690 --> 01:07:35,322
Damayanti...?
- About you, about me...

648
01:07:35,529 --> 01:07:37,656
about today and tomorrow...
she knows it all

649
01:07:44,204 --> 01:07:45,171
crazy

650
01:08:02,155 --> 01:08:05,124
You have something to lose
and something to gain

651
01:08:07,561 --> 01:08:12,589
You'll get to discover a very
crucial truth. Do you want to?

652
01:08:30,550 --> 01:08:35,146
The same old story told afresh.
From childhood to adolescence

653
01:08:35,689 --> 01:08:40,149
Dreams of those days of youth,
you shall now revisit

654
01:08:40,727 --> 01:08:46,165
"Tell me, someone...
what is love?"

655
01:08:46,700 --> 01:08:52,161
"Tell me, please...
why do I pine thus?"

656
01:08:52,939 --> 01:08:59,174
"As I sit by myself,
why am I reminded of someone?"

657
01:09:01,648 --> 01:09:07,109
"Are you also going through
what I'm going through?"

658
01:09:07,654 --> 01:09:09,622
"Are you...?"

659
01:09:10,891 --> 01:09:14,850
"No, never... don't ever
let such a thing happen"

660
01:09:15,328 --> 01:09:22,131
"Don't ever lose your heart,
let's not talk about this, please"

661
01:09:22,903 --> 01:09:27,135
"Don't say such things,
please tell me...

662
01:09:27,841 --> 01:09:35,805
"what's love?
Tell me, why do I pine this?"

663
01:09:40,420 --> 01:09:43,150
She's beginning to soften
towards him

664
01:09:44,925 --> 01:09:48,156
"Tamanna's stepping into
adolescence all over again"

665
01:10:05,879 --> 01:10:11,181
"It's this age of adolescence
that is beyond one's control"

666
01:10:11,785 --> 01:10:17,189
"Or it's perhaps how
you and I feel at heart"

667
01:10:17,924 --> 01:10:23,191
"Not without reason does one feel
a sense of belonging to someone"

668
01:10:23,764 --> 01:10:29,202
"This in itself bears testimony
to what I've just said"

669
01:10:29,736 --> 01:10:35,197
"There is someone I love
from the depths of my heart..."

670
01:10:35,742 --> 01:10:37,710
"does she also have the
same feeling of love for me?"

671
01:10:38,779 --> 01:10:42,738
"No, never... don't ever
let such a thing happen"

672
01:10:43,250 --> 01:10:50,213
"Don't ever lose your heart,
let's not talk about this, please"

673
01:10:50,924 --> 01:10:56,726
"Don't say such things,
please tell me...

674
01:10:57,264 --> 01:11:05,171
"what's love?
Tell me, why do I pine thus?"

675
01:11:06,940 --> 01:11:08,908
Unknown territory for you, Tamanna

676
01:11:10,377 --> 01:11:13,835
I hope you know where you must stop
and where you can walk on

677
01:11:15,348 --> 01:11:17,680
Where to stagger,
where to steady yourself

678
01:11:30,831 --> 01:11:36,201
"This is the path I've
chosen to tread..."

679
01:11:36,803 --> 01:11:42,207
"even if the world
calls me mad"

680
01:11:42,809 --> 01:11:48,213
"With you, it all began.
With you, it now culminates..."

681
01:11:48,748 --> 01:11:54,209
"that's the story of my life,
everything I have ever done"

682
01:11:54,754 --> 01:12:02,160
"Are you also going through
what I'm going through?"

683
01:12:03,763 --> 01:12:05,162
Say "yes", Tamanna

684
01:12:05,365 --> 01:12:07,833
"Tell me, please do..."

685
01:12:08,368 --> 01:12:12,168
"Don't ever lose your heart..."

686
01:12:12,539 --> 01:12:16,339
Between gaining and losing there's
just a moment... don't refuse

687
01:12:16,910 --> 01:12:19,174
Go ahead. Take his hand

688
01:12:19,946 --> 01:12:22,176
Else, your refusal will turn
into a long wait for me

689
01:12:23,516 --> 01:12:28,180
I want to move on. I want to see what
lies behind this thing we call love

690
01:12:28,755 --> 01:12:30,188
Go ahead!

691
01:12:59,819 --> 01:13:01,810
Antara, you...?

692
01:13:02,656 --> 01:13:05,147
I had stolen the idea of Tamanna
from your life

693
01:13:06,359 --> 01:13:09,157
But how could you yourself
turn into Tamanna...?
