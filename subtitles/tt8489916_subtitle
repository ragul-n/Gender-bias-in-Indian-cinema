1
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,440
Towards the end of 16th century...

2
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:15,240
The French made their way into India
through coastal areas like...

3
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:16,840
Cochin...

4
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,000
Chennai...

5
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,280
Thoothukudi...

6
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,520
Pondicherry...

7
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,400
Vishakapatnam...

8
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,680
Mangalore...

9
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,120
Kolkata...

10
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,200
Gujarat...

11
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,320
Goa...

12
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,320
Mumbai...

13
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,440
The set their foot in all these cities

14
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,840
In all these places, where
they set their foot on...

15
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:38,880
their national game, football,
is still quite popular

16
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,880
Especially in North Chennai

17
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,120
Hit it! Hit it, Shantha!

18
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,240
Hit it!

19
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,320
Dude!

20
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,520
Awesome Shantha! Come on!

21
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,880
Who's the guy who scored the goal?

22
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,560
Shantha, boss. He's from Perambur.
1st year college student

23
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,760
And his friend?

24
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,520
Goldstar Gopi, from our
locality, Pulianthope

25
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,120
He didn't even pass
the 12th grade

26
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,560
Find out all the details
about both of them

27
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,720
Ok, boss

28
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,400
What was our boss telling you?

29
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:21,080
Looks like he has his
eyes set on those two

30
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,120
Well...

31
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:11,040
Why have second thoughts?
Imagine, you'll get 0.3 millions

32
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,920
It's not like we are asking you to murder

33
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,680
Just take the blame for the
murder our boss commits. Simple

34
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,440
At your current age, you'll
only get a 6 month jail term

35
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,640
Give it a good thought

36
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,480
Gopi, I don't have a
good feeling about this

37
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,400
You! What's your problem?

38
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,560
Give it a good thought and let us know.
Come, let's go talk to Ram

39
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,960
Gopi, no! Your football career
will be over for good!

40
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,080
Well, you are well off. Your dad
works in the Electricity Board

41
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,360
Only I know how much I'm
struggling to buy a tee and a shoe

42
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,560
What did he say?

43
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,080
- He hasn't given a reply yet
- You have no idea. You leave

44
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,040
Get lost!

45
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,360
This is going to kill you!

46
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,920
Balu!

47
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,200
Mom! Please! No! Please, don't beat me

48
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,240
How many time have I warned
you from playing football?

49
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,440
Again and again you go
behind me and play football?

50
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,040
You'll learn a lesson only
if I break your legs!

51
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,600
- Mom, please! Please, don't beat me!
- Now, come!

52
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,760
- Get in!
- Mom, please don't beat me!

53
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,160
My dear, Joe...

54
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,960
Are you upset with me?

55
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,840
Are you upset that I thrashed you
in front of your friends? Sorry dear

56
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,040
Listen, let's keep away from football, dear

57
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,640
I want you to study medicine and practice
as a doctor in a reputed hospital

58
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,600
Dear Joe, who else do I have?
Only you!

59
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,520
I won't play football anymore.
Now, stop crying

60
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,400
Our father in heaven...

61
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,240
Lord Ebenezer, who has lead us thus far...

62
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,920
Please bless this child

63
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,560
In the name of the Father, and of the Son,
and of the Holy Spirit - Amen

64
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,240
Father, please advise him
to forget football and focus on studies

65
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,760
Mom, didn't I already give my
word that I won't play football?

66
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,160
There! He said it

67
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,840
He is a good boy.
He'll live up to his words

68
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,360
Super!

69
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,000
Give a round of applause for Jones

70
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,280
Rest of the boys, go to your classroom

71
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,320
After school, you all must report
to me in the ground at 4 pm

72
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,520
Ok, sir!

73
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,360
Won't your mom thrash you if she finds
out you've joined the football team?

74
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,160
Mom will thrash me only
if she finds out. Right?

75
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,040
Oh-ho! So you are going to
play without her knowledge?

76
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,120
Yeah right!

77
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,960
"Champion! I'm a champion!"

78
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,720
"Champion! I'm a champion!"

79
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,800
"Champion! I'm a champion!"

80
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:38,000
That was awesome, Jones!

81
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:41,560
"Champion! I'm a champion!"

82
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:45,280
"Champion! I'm a champion!"

83
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,640
If you keep playing at the school level...

84
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,520
then you can't fulfill your dad's
dream of making you a great player

85
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,320
Well, now I'm playing at school level

86
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,680
Next, at university level

87
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,440
Then somehow make it to the Tamil Nadu
team and finally, play for India, Pavi

88
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:46,880
Which era are you living in? Many have
made it to Indian team at the age of 19!

89
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,480
And then there is you!

90
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,680
Here, the application form
of the best academy here

91
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:57,080
You can make it to the Indian team only
if you train and play in such academies

92
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,920
- What's the academy called?
- Chennai metro football academy

93
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:05,440
Raman Vijayan, who played from '96 - '00
for India, is the coach here

94
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:08,960
Get selected to play for them and
you'll get the biggest break of your life

95
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,960
How are you aware of all this?

96
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,880
All the credit must go to Google!

97
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,280
Whoa!

98
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,000
The academy looks grand!

99
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,440
Look here, don't plead!

100
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,880
- Be confident when you talk. Ok?
- Ok

101
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,400
Please sign here

102
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,680
Your turn

103
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,720
Told you, this is one of the best academy

104
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,880
- Sir
- Tell me

105
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,280
Sir, good evening

106
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,320
Sir, good evening

107
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,040
- Sir, good evening
- Good evening

108
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,200
Greetings, sir

109
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,040
What is this?

110
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,240
Tell me, what's the matter?

111
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,880
Sir, I am Jones

112
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,080
From which school

113
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,200
- Government school
- Which place?

114
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,840
Vyasarpadi

115
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,600
Vyasarpadi? What's the matter?

116
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,880
Sir, I'm a good football player

117
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,840
Let that be

118
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,160
Are good at attacking with Razors?

119
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,640
How about hurling glass bottles?

120
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,600
Wielding a knife?

121
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,440
Dealing with Marijuana, then the powder?

122
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,560
- Answer me
- Excuse me, sir!

123
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,320
Stop stereotyping the North
Madras boys as thugs!

124
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:26,840
I don't deny the fact that such
rogues existed there but long ago

125
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,440
But now we are getting educated. In fact,
many have succeeded and are in abroad now

126
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,200
Times have changed but the way
you all look at us, hasn't

127
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,640
Forgive me! I apologize

128
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,120
Mr. Jones, in order to join this academy...

129
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:42,960
#1. You must get the certificates,
for the teams that you've played for

130
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,040
#2. You must provide
your conduct certificate...

131
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,800
signed by your PT
master or class teacher

132
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,920
#3. You must bring your parents

133
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,400
#4. The most important thing...

134
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,760
The yearly fee is Rs. 60,000

135
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:59,080
Sir, I'll show my football skills.
Just watch it once

136
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,720
Listen, you can step in the ground only
after paying the yearly fee of Rs. 60,000

137
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,080
First, go arrange it

138
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,800
Sir, just give me one chance

139
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,480
Please, sir

140
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,880
Now, leave. Take a hike!

141
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:12,080
Comes from a poor background
and wants to play football!

142
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,360
Hit it!

143
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:37,080
"Step up, my dear son!
You are the champion!"

144
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,840
"You are the one who
will fulfill my dreams"

145
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:47,640
"Keep playing and
progressing, oh my dear son"

146
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:51,240
"If you know where you're
headed, then you are genius"

147
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:58,160
"All that every father yearns for,
is for their son to fulfill their dreams"

148
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:05,400
"All that a father wishes is that his
son should live life on his own terms!"

149
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:22,160
"Your favorite game is the only thing
that will motivate you to wake up early"

150
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:26,400
"Keep practicing until body and mind sync
with each other and that"ll sculpt you!"

151
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,760
Mom, is dad an expert in cooking?

152
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,080
He is an excellent chef!

153
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:36,320
"The ground that you play in will teach
you a hundred lessons. So, concentrate!"

154
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:43,720
"Will power is what will take
you to the top. So, focus!"

155
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:47,720
"And when life starts playing with you..."

156
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:51,320
"by then you must have
learnt to be victorious"

157
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:05,720
Jaya, our son is an extraordinary
football player

158
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:09,800
Wait and watch, he'll surely
represent India one day

159
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,640
- Jones...
- Yes, dad

160
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,800
When I was a kid, I always dreamt
of becoming a successful football player

161
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,400
I dreamt of getting selected
in the Indian team

162
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,760
But none of my dreams came true

163
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,840
I want you to become a
successful football player...

164
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,880
and fulfill my dreams. Will you?

165
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,800
- Where's Anand and Jones?
- There's Anand

166
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,240
And then?

167
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,720
40

168
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,520
Where is Jones?

169
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,240
With Dhamu at Pulianthope, playing
sevens player football match

170
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:56,640
The sevens conducted by
the area councilor, Dhanasekar?

171
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:57,440
Yes

172
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,360
Damn it! Why did you let him play Sevens?

173
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,520
Any idea why Dhanasekar
conducts those matches?

174
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,000
He'll divert skillful and active players
into violence and turn them in to rogues

175
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,600
Do you know how many good
players have turned rogues?

176
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,280
To hell with you!

177
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,360
That's a foul!

178
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,280
A foul? That too in Sevens? Get
up and get on with the game

179
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,400
Stop staring and
stop showing off!

180
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,440
Who's that guy in Cement colored Tee?
Quite skillful and active!

181
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,200
No idea, boss. I'll find out

182
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,960
Well played, Jones!

183
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,680
I'll call you.
Do come for the next match

184
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,520
Pavi, why are you avoiding me?

185
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,160
Answer me!

186
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,480
Why would you play the Sevens match?

187
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,520
Don't you know Sevens
match is a violent game?

188
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,400
What if you had broken your arms or legs?

189
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,840
Wasn't it you, who wanted
me to join the academy?

190
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,680
How can I afford so much money?

191
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,240
I thought of I'll play
Sevens during weekends

192
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:59,280
And arrange the money in 6
months and join the academy

193
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:04,640
Even once you fracture any bone in those
6 months, your football career will be over

194
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,920
You tell me, what can be done

195
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,680
You need money, right?

196
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,080
I'll give you

197
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,360
Here. I had saved some Rs. 12,000

198
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,680
Have this for now

199
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:22,000
The remaining amount; as I've enrolled for
Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics tuition

200
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,720
So, I'll collect the tuition fee
from home and give to you

201
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,120
What if your parents find out?

202
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,360
All they want from me is good scores

203
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,560
I'll study hard. Won't I
do that much for you?

204
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:36,160
Look here, Pavi, I can't repay you
so much money

205
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,840
Think twice!

206
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:41,240
You don't have to repay me this money

207
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:45,280
Instead, just give me your love
and take care of me forever

208
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:01,320
"An unknown fragrance
covers up my heart"

209
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:09,360
"The fragrance that of
the angel beside me"

210
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:15,160
"I could feel flowers
blossoming in my world"

211
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,800
"Feels like I'm living in an
isolated, pleasant island"

212
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,400
"All those beautiful images inside me..."

213
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,880
"are slowly becoming a reality"

214
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:33,600
"All my yearnings and desires..."

215
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:37,360
"are sparking up and turning into flames"

216
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:14,920
"I am lost in love and
looking for direction"

217
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,640
"But I'm enjoying this impact
that you have had on me"

218
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:22,640
"For the first time I am
having such unknown desires"

219
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:26,240
"Used to talk a lot but now I feel shy"

220
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,720
"Something is happening to
me and I am losing myself"

221
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:33,760
"My whole world has gone topsy-turvy"

222
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:37,400
"I can't feel anything else
and I have lost my mind"

223
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:42,800
"Stop making me feel desperate
and loved at the same time"

224
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:48,560
"All those beautiful images inside me..."

225
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,360
"are slowly becoming a reality"

226
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:56,040
"All my yearnings and desires..."

227
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:00,000
"are sparking up and turning into flames"

228
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,840
"If I ever get a chance to
hold your hands and walk..."

229
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:16,680
"my happiness will know no
bounds and I will walk forever"

230
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:20,640
"It suddenly rains in my world"

231
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,760
"I am an innocent soul, lost in love"

232
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:28,080
"Your love turns my world greener
and makes my dream look beautiful"

233
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,600
"I am very clear that I am lost in love"

234
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:35,320
"I hear my heart pound and sing for you"

235
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:41,560
"Nothing is clear but my
heart is overflowing with joy"

236
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:46,400
"All those beautiful images inside me..."

237
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,840
"are slowly becoming a reality"

238
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,920
"All my yearnings and desires..."

239
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:57,600
"are sparking up and turning into flames"

240
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:05,480
"An unknown fragrance
covers up my heart"

241
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:13,800
"The fragrance that of
the angel beside me"

242
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:19,920
"I could feel flowers
blossoming in my world"

243
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,960
"Feels like I'm living in an
isolated, pleasant island"

244
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:31,160
"All those beautiful images inside me..."

245
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:35,080
"are slowly becoming a reality"

246
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:38,520
"All my yearnings and desires..."

247
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:42,280
"are sparking up and turning into flames"

248
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,840
"All those beautiful images inside me..."

249
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,400
"are slowly becoming a reality"

250
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:53,360
"All my yearnings and desires..."

251
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:57,400
"are sparking up and turning into flames"

252
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:05,360
'Jones, Pavithira'

253
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,240
Every month she collects fee
at home for her tuition

254
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,320
She has been cheating us!

255
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:34,040
This boy is a genuine fellow. Your
daughter gave him the money willingly

256
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,360
Look, money is not the matter here

257
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,200
If my daughter continues
her education in this school...

258
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,440
her life will be spoiled

259
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,280
Don't make hasty decision.
She is a smart student

260
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,200
Making her quit this school
half way will affect her life

261
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,840
Give me a little time, I'll talk
to her and set her straight

262
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,680
Madam, stop trying to convince me. Ok?

263
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:53,240
Please issue my daughter
a Transfer Certificate

264
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,640
- Mom, please no!
- I said, come!

265
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,240
Please let me continue in this school!

266
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,600
We've spoiled you enough
with our pampering!

267
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,800
- Mom, please!
- I said, let's go!

268
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,680
Mom!

269
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,920
Shut up and come!

270
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:34,920
"All those images inside me..."

271
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:39,240
"are slowly becoming a reality"

272
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:43,960
"All my yearnings and desires..."

273
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:49,240
"are now burning down into ashes"

274
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,000
Jones...

275
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,040
- Wait, I'll be back
- Ok

276
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,240
Master...

277
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,520
Didn't you see you at the
ground for past 2 days

278
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,080
Well...master, I fell sick

279
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:05,480
Don't you lie to me.
Your friends told me everything

280
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,040
Stop thinking and forget about her

281
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,600
Win over life and all that you want
will find you

282
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:21,600
I have put in a word to a coach,
Shantha at YMSC academy

283
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,960
I'll hand you a recommendation letter.
Go meet him

284
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,320
Ok, master

285
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,440
Good morning, sir

286
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,600
Good morning

287
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,280
Who are you?

288
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,520
I'm here on Senthil sir's order

289
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:46,160
- Jones?
- Yes, sir

290
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,240
Ok

291
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,800
Hold the ball and do push ups

292
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,400
Full name?

293
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,520
Jones Dhiraviyam

294
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,440
Father's name

295
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,880
Gopinath Dhiraviyam

296
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,640
Mother's name

297
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,280
Jayalakshmi

298
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,080
You are a good player, Jones

299
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,200
Thanks you, sir

300
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,240
You can join the
practice from tomorrow

301
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,120
Ok, sir

302
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,960
Before joining...

303
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:22,160
we'll need your parents to sign
an agreement. So, bring them too

304
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:26,240
Why don't you give me the form?
I'll get their signature

305
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:28,160
They must come here and sign the form

306
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,800
Since you're joining tomorrow,
bring them also

307
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,440
My dad is out of station

308
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,840
Bring him once he's back

309
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,480
Ok, sir

310
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,680
See you, Jones

311
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:53,560
Why did you ask him
to bring his parents, sir?

312
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,640
Senthil sir recommended him, isn't it?

313
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,000
Guess, who is that boy?

314
00:25:58,840 --> 00:25:59,920
I don't know, sir

315
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,400
Goldstar Gopi's son

316
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,240
Gopi's son?

317
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,600
He left promising to bring
his late father

318
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,320
Let's wait and watch

319
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,120
Buddy...

320
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:15,280
I want to see my son play football
for India and become a great player

321
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,080
It would be great if you can train him

322
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,920
I have no problem in training your son

323
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,040
But he must be passionate about the game

324
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,960
We must not force them into anything

325
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:28,480
Try playing football with him
and see if he loves the game

326
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,120
If he is passionate then bring him to me

327
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,320
I'll let him join the club

328
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,640
Buddy, Shantha has a point

329
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,040
Ok, buddy

330
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:47,000
You promised I'll get the liquor
anytime now. Are you bluffing?

331
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,600
- Get lost!
- Here he is

332
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:55,800
Here you go

333
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,400
Hope you'll play your part as explained

334
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,440
Act it out once

335
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,520
Sir...

336
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:29,680
it's my dream to see my son
become a great football player

337
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:34,240
- Please let him join your club, sir
- Get up! People are watching!

338
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,040
Stop falling at my feet. Come on!

339
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,800
My son must become a great football player.
That's my dream

340
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,480
That's all you got to say. Got it?

341
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,800
So, don't I have to plead?

342
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,720
It's an injury prone area

343
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,080
Good morning, coach

344
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,640
What is it? Tell me!

345
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,360
- I'm out right now
- My father is here

346
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:54,760
I'll tell you later

347
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:57,360
- Dad! Dad!
- Coming

348
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:09,280
My dad wants me to become
a great football player, coach

349
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,400
Isn't it dad?

350
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,840
- Is it Gopi Dhiraviyam?
- Tell him, dad

351
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,520
What are you wondering?
Now, say it!

352
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,040
Tell me, sir

353
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:24,240
Shantha, forgive me!

354
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,560
In the desire for liquor,
I fell for this boy's request!

355
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,680
I'll never accept any favor
from such kids anymore!

356
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:29,600
Dad!

357
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,400
Dad!

358
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,120
Are you calling out
to your late father?

359
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:36,160
I know who you are, who's your father
and your whole legacy!

360
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,320
Sorry, coach

361
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:41,280
Fine, go bring Mrs. Jayalaksmi Gopi

362
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,360
I'll let you join

363
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,000
Bring my mother?

364
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,160
Go, bring her

365
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,520
Leave

366
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:48,600
Ok, coach

367
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:52,640
Looks like he'll go and
bring his mother right away

368
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,400
You have no idea about his mother

369
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,680
It's been 10 days
since we moved to this house

370
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,360
Your son?

371
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,480
I have put him the
government school nearby

372
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,760
Where did you say,
you are working?

373
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,800
At the Indira mill in Vysarpadi...

374
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,680
for a monthly salary of Rs. 4,500

375
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:20,000
Gopi wanted to make his son
a successful football player

376
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:25,960
Last time I saw your son, you must have
seen the way he dive kicked the ball

377
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:30,400
Ok Jaya, tomorrow bring him to my club

378
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,520
Please, no!

379
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,920
Please keep my son away from football

380
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:37,320
The moment my husband died
in a football ground...

381
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,800
I was done with this game!

382
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,760
- Jaya...
- Please! No, thanks!

383
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,280
We don't need it

384
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,880
Please don't force me

385
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,640
Football is not good for my son

386
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,080
Mom...

387
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,840
- Mom...
- Yes?

388
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:12,200
Do you know Shantha, the football coach

389
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,560
Why do you ask?

390
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:25,640
Well, the coach said he knows
you and dad, very well

391
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,520
Did he invite you to play football?

392
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,720
No, mom! Since I play football
very well at school level

393
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,480
My PT master said I have a
great future as a football player

394
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:35,120
He put me through to
Shantha master at YMSC club

395
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:40,200
Utter the word
'Football' again and...

396
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,520
that's it!

397
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,160
You better focus on your studies!
Now, go!

398
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,560
You heard me!

399
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,960
Come, have food

400
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,240
You eat!

401
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,120
Food's the last thing I need!

402
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,600
Jaya...

403
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:55,000
it's been a while since Jones left

404
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:00,960
Jones...

405
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,320
Come and eat

406
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,880
Your mom won't know if you have food here

407
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,680
Yesterday's lunch was
the last time you ate

408
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:12,720
If you keep starving like this,
you'll end up hurting yourself

409
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:33,040
Jaya! Jaya!

410
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,960
Jaya! Jaya!

411
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:39,480
- Your son fainted at the school
- What?

412
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:41,640
Your son fainted at the school

413
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,520
He has gone weak.
Which is why he fainted

414
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:54,000
I've given him glucose drips. Nothing
to worry. Ask him to eat properly

415
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,320
You may go, see him

416
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,680
Nurse...

417
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:39,680
- Can we take him home?
- The doctor will let you know

418
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:44,800
Mala...

419
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,600
- Can you please wait outside?
- Ok

420
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,160
What's with this attitude?

421
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,760
What is wrong with you?

422
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,400
I warned you to keep
away from football

423
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,360
Yet why are you so stubborn?
Can't you understand?

424
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,160
 Jaya! No!

425
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:03,880
Open the door

426
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:06,080
Instead of starving and
making my life a hell...

427
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:09,000
you could've consumed poison and died!

428
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,640
I too would've followed you!

429
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,480
Why are you killing me
nice and slow?

430
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,600
Open the door! Jaya, open the door!

431
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,480
- Good morning, sir
- Good morning

432
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:26,760
As promised, Gopi's son
has brought his mother

433
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,080
Mom, the coach has arrived

434
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:34,280
Jaya, how are you?

435
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,640
Going on

436
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,320
Brother...

437
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,600
I tried my best to make him understand

438
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:47,480
Let him fulfill his father's
dream, when I'm alive

439
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:52,920
Please make a man out of him

440
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,800
Look here, Jaya

441
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:57,080
Gopi had a dream about him

442
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:59,040
I will ensure that is fulfilled

443
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,000
Trust me

444
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,080
See you, Jaya

445
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,600
Jones Dhiraviyam...

446
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:14,440
Sir...

447
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:17,080
You are going to be an Indian player

448
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:18,600
Sure, sir

449
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,720
"Step forward, you brave heart!"

450
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,680
"Be a champ, come on!"

451
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:30,800
"Win over yourself and come
prepared to win over the world"

452
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,360
Come on, boys! Speed up!

453
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:34,800
Come on! Go!

454
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,320
Run! Run! Run fast!

455
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,680
Don't cross over the line!

456
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:42,120
"Overtake thousands here and
you will be one in a million"

457
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:46,040
"The goal to win runs through
your pulses and veins"

458
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,360
Go! Pass! Pass!

459
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,280
Quick! Quick!

460
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,200
Move! Move!

461
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:54,320
"The mind will train your
body to be tough! So, rise!"

462
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:58,480
"Champion! I'm a champion.
Rise up like the kind tide!"

463
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:02,560
"Champion! I'm a champion.
This isn't just a game but life!"

464
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,280
"Champion, I am a champion"

465
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:10,240
"Let the game be your life and identity.
So, step up and face the heat! Come on!"

466
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:11,560
Jones...

467
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:15,000
you played really well, yesterday

468
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,400
Thank you

469
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,640
Sathish is a good friend of mine

470
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:22,800
Are you also studying in AKS college?

471
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,280
Yes, I study at AKS college!

472
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:41,880
Jones!

473
00:36:56,280 --> 00:37:03,400
"Prepare yourself mentally and physically.
Motivate yourself"

474
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:11,560
"Be like both, the storm and the sun.
That is what is needed here"

475
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:17,160
"Keep progressing and time
will take care of the rest"

476
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,840
"Overtake thousands here and
you will be one in a million"

477
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:26,920
"The goal to win runs through
your pulses and veins"

478
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:31,000
"You are your competition! You
are the son of this soil!"

479
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,280
Come on, boys!

480
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:41,680
Pass! Pass!

481
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,280
Jones! Jones! Pass it to me!

482
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:45,800
Pass!

483
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,560
Jones! Pass!

484
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,360
Look, no one's here. Pass!

485
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,160
Oh! Come on, pass!

486
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,600
Dheena was running free on the right

487
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:03,520
It could've been an easy goal if
you had passed the ball to him

488
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,920
Why are you playing a selfish game?

489
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:05,800
Sorry, coach

490
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:08,400
Football is not an individual game.
It's a team game!

491
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:13,720
"Join hands and play like a team..."

492
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,960
"And victory will come find you"

493
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:24,640
"The dawn will surely bring light
after the night, no matter what"

494
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:30,280
"Run! Play! Your arms and
limbs are your strength!"

495
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:36,520
"Overtake thousands here and
you will be one in a million"

496
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:40,400
"The goal to win runs through
your pulses and veins"

497
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,880
"You are your competition! You
are the son of this soil!"

498
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:43,760
Go! Go!

499
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:44,760
Go boys!

500
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:48,040
"The mind will train your
body to be tough! So, rise!"

501
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:51,080
"Champion! I'm a champion.
Rise up like the kind tide!"

502
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:52,080
Yes!

503
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:57,000
"Champion! I'm a champion.
This isn't just a game but life!"

504
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,720
"Champion! I'm a champion!"

505
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:04,720
"Let the game be your life and identity.
So, step up and face the heat! Come on!"

506
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:11,080
Win the next match
and cut an even bigger cake

507
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:12,120
Sure, buddy

508
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:16,040
- Sana ordered this cake. Feed her first
- Is it?

509
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,240
Thanks

510
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:22,280
- All of you, look here
- Time to click a photo

511
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,200
Sana!

512
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:28,400
What are you doing here?

513
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:30,800
I'm with my friends

514
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:38,920
Who is he?

515
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,280
My elder brother.
Shows off too much

516
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:44,360
He's from the Mechanical department

517
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,400
Start!

518
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:01,680
Good! Good!

519
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:03,800
Well done

520
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,520
The boy's good, Shantha

521
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:24,760
He has got the skills

522
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:28,160
Still, let me talk to the club members.
I'll give you an update in 10 days

523
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:31,240
You know very well that they'll
make him sign a 3 year contract

524
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,960
He'll be entitled to a monthly salary

525
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,680
I League, ISL...He'll get a lot
of such opportunities to play

526
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:37,920
In fact he can play for India in the future

527
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:40,480
But to play in the main 11...

528
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:43,240
he must have at least played
and achieved in 1st division games

529
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:46,800
Ok, buddy! We'll meet you
after he achieves that!

530
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,120
Ok, all the best

531
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,400
If we must erect the tower
in some other house roof...

532
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:52,720
there are a lot of formalities
and procedure, Dhana

533
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:53,440
Ok, sir

534
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:54,840
That's impossible right now

535
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:57,600
Let's extend the lease
on Gopi's house itself, Dhana

536
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:58,440
Ok, sir

537
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,480
I'll do the needful for you

538
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:01,960
I'll seal the deal for you, sir

539
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,880
Please get the agreement copy ready

540
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:06,280
- I'll take care of the rest
- Ok Dhana. I'll do that

541
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:17,520
(chatter)

542
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:25,800
Hey! Fall at their feet
and get their blessings

543
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:28,080
Gopi, you have found an
excellent life partner

544
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:30,960
Lead a happy married life.
Please, get up

545
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,840
Suji, here have this meat liver piece

546
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:43,720
Look at Gopi.
He is not an outsider for us

547
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:45,920
He is family

548
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,360
Excuse me

549
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,360
Please, come in

550
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,280
I have already informed boss

551
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:00,480
Just come with the money for registration

552
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:02,120
We'll take care of it. Welcome

553
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:04,240
As promised, don't
forget my 2% commission

554
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:05,800
Welcome, Jaya.
How have you been?

555
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,000
I'm doing good

556
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,040
Mini...

557
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,200
look, Jaya is here

558
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,000
Here

559
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:17,240
So, what's up Jaya?

560
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:19,000
Sit. Sit

561
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,840
Hope your son is studying well

562
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:23,400
Leela...

563
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:24,840
Yes, he is

564
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:27,080
Saw your son when he was a kid

565
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:29,440
He must be a grown up now

566
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,160
Take this

567
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,800
- Hope you're doing fine, Jaya.
- Did you notice the doorstep of my house?

568
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:37,840
You would've seen the number
of people waiting to meet me

569
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:41,120
The central minister, Boopathy
has an immense respect on me

570
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,800
It was a time when things
were picking up...

571
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:48,400
unfortunately Gopi passed away then

572
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:53,760
Ask my men! Whenever a
problem rises up, I call out 'Gopi' first

573
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:55,440
- Tell her
- He's speaking the truth

574
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:00,160
The moment I saw you now...

575
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,000
I was reminded of him

576
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:03,320
Well, Jaya...

577
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:05,520
my daughter has come of age

578
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:07,480
People keep visiting me

579
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:09,640
Mini wanted me to have a separate office

580
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,160
Well, I'm considering your house

581
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:13,520
I thought I'll use that

582
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:16,760
Look, I'll pay you more that
what others are offering

583
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:21,560
It'll be my way of thanking Gopi

584
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:24,840
Please forgive me

585
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:32,600
Though we are not
living there now...

586
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:35,120
my husband's soul is still alive there

587
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:40,200
Someday when my son turns
into a man, we will move there

588
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:42,200
Please forgive me

589
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:45,880
I wish that at some point my son
should live his life in that house

590
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:49,160
Come on, don't cry
for such a silly thing

591
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:52,040
I thought the money will help you

592
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:57,160
It's okay

593
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:00,080
Good things will happen at the right time

594
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:01,200
Ok, Jaya...

595
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:05,240
Please, sit down. Mini, bring her food

596
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:06,520
Please eat before you leave

597
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:07,600
See you, dear

598
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:09,320
Boss is on his way.
Keep the car ready

599
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:16,960
Your brother is a cricket player
and so I thought you like circket

600
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:18,360
But looks like you like football

601
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:19,200
Dude...

602
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:23,920
a guy from Pulianthope
is stalking Madhi

603
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,000
He is blackmailing her, that if she
doesn't love him then he'll commit suicide

604
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:29,240
He stalks her every day
until she reaches her home

605
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:32,840
If her family finds out this,
then they'll make her quit college

606
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:36,160
Earlier, he tortured another girl in
similar manner and made her fall for him

607
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:38,120
She loved him sincerely

608
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:40,600
He used her for a year and then dumped her

609
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:41,840
His name?

610
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:44,240
Dhamu. There! That's him

611
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:45,200
Excuse me...

612
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:47,640
What is it?

613
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:50,000
She studies in our department

614
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:52,120
So what?

615
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,600
Please don't disturb her again hereafter

616
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:57,120
Which locality do you belong to?

617
00:44:57,720 --> 00:44:58,840
Vyasarpadi

618
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:00,800
Any idea where I am from?

619
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:02,360
Pulianthope

620
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:08,280
Come on, Madhi. Why would you drag
these boys for this silly matter?

621
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:12,560
We very well know that you're a womanizer

622
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:17,040
If you create unnecessary issues...

623
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:19,840
we'll have to report
it to the principal

624
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:21,000
Got it?

625
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:22,720
Come on

626
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:32,720
So, you made him go crazy for you

627
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:40,360
She's Shabir's sister.
It'll become an issue later

628
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:43,440
Don't I know that she is Shabir's sister?

629
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,720
Didn't he spoil my plan to woo Madhi?

630
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:50,840
What are you going to do?

631
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:53,040
Just stay here and watch me

632
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:54,320
Wait, I'll be back

633
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:58,640
Back then, I was in 11th grade
and that boy was in 9th grade

634
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:00,960
He just took off when he found
out I was 2 years elder!

635
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:01,960
Really?

636
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:04,240
That was not Love at all

637
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:12,040
What happened?

638
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:13,680
Nothing

639
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:15,600
Can't you hear me?

640
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:17,120
Told you, nothing

641
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:19,520
What is it?

642
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:22,120
- Tell me, what is it?
- Nothing!

643
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:27,560
Damn you pervert! How dare
you lay hands on a woman!

644
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:32,760
Jones! No! We shall complaint
this to principal!

645
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Stop!

646
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Stop!

647
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,120
- I said, stop!
- Listen dude, no!

648
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:01,880
Jones, stop!

649
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:04,960
(chatter)

650
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,600
Don't you both fight anymore.
Be good friends hereafter, ok?

651
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:08,880
Ok, boss

652
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:12,280
You! What's the issue? Check them

653
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:15,280
- Stop! Who are you guys?
- Move!

654
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:19,520
- Take the bike and catch them
- Ok, boss

655
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:21,040
Naveen, hope you've a weapon with you

656
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:21,920
Yes! I do

657
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:28,680
Listen! You don't need this!

658
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:36,240
Stop!

659
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:43,680
Let go off me!

660
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:45,080
Hands off me! Leave me!

661
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:48,120
Leave him!

662
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:49,000
I said, leave me!

663
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:49,840
Move!

664
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:51,560
- Jones, let go of him
- Let me deal with him!

665
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:53,320
No, listen! Let go of him!

666
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:59,200
Listen to me, Jones.
He might die!

667
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:06,240
Jones, he might die

668
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:08,280
Leave me

669
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:16,440
Stop! What's your problem?

670
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:17,680
- What's is it?
- Guess, what he did?

671
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:19,560
He misbehaved with my classmate

672
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:20,840
Let of me! I said, leave me!

673
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:22,440
- Tell me
- Ask him!

674
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:25,040
How dare you misbehave
with a girl?

675
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:26,560
Who do you think you are?

676
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:28,520
Listen to me! Can't you hear me?

677
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:30,240
Now, quiet! Come on!

678
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:31,520
Stop him!

679
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:36,680
Stop it! What do you think you're doing?

680
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:37,960
Who are you?

681
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:43,320
How dare you lay hands on me?

682
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:44,480
Damn it!

683
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:48,200
Naveen, no! He is
Gold star Gopi's son!

684
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:49,040
Don't hurt him!

685
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:51,160
What? Gopi's son?

686
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:52,320
Yes!

687
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:56,080
Out of the blue I saw him
fighting with him

688
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:57,080
Fight for a girl?

689
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:59,240
Finish him off!

690
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:02,320
How dare you lay hands on
your own college girl?

691
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:04,040
You'll be dead! Now, get lost!

692
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:06,600
Don't you act like a pervert and
spoil our locality's name!

693
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:10,120
Don't you create unnecessary
problems in the locality

694
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:12,680
Then you'll also get killed
like your father got killed

695
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:14,880
- Naveen!
- Yes, boss?

696
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:16,160
What's the issue?

697
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:18,200
Silly issue, boss.
They're fighting over a girl

698
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:21,120
I'll take care of it, boss.
You carry on

699
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:22,640
Ok, let's go

700
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:25,320
All of you disperse

701
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:27,160
I said, leave! Leave!

702
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:29,880
You heard me! Now, leave!
Take him away

703
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:31,680
Come on, let's go!

704
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:32,920
We'll deal it later

705
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,040
Come on!

706
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:40,240
Then you'll also get killed
like your father got killed

707
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:43,040
Come on!

708
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:45,520
He too belongs to our locality

709
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:47,600
He is Gold star Gopi's son

710
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:49,640
He's our boy!

711
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:52,720
- He's my best friend, Gopi's son
- Don't look over there! Just come

712
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:58,320
Then you'll also get killed
like your father got killed

713
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:06,640
Brother please, just a minute.
Just a minute...

714
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:10,360
You said "You'll also get killed
like your father got killed"

715
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:13,240
- Uh-oh! Did I blabber it out?
- Why was my dad murdered?

716
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:15,080
Who murdered my father?

717
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:18,040
Who told you so?

718
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:20,200
- You said it, didn't you?
- Stop blabbing and get lost!

719
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:24,080
Please! Didn't you tell me 'You'll also get
killed like your father got killed?'

720
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:25,920
Please, tell me. Why was
my father murdered?

721
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:28,000
Hands off me! I'll lay one slap!

722
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:31,800
- Who's Rajiv Gandhi fighting with?
- Looks like someone from our locality

723
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:34,280
- Didn't I already tell you...
- Please, tell me. What did it?

724
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:36,760
I shouldn't see you around here anymore

725
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:37,840
Leave

726
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:38,680
I said, leave

727
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:39,920
Leave!

728
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:47,440
What are you doing here?

729
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:50,960
I asked you, what are you doing here?

730
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:55,840
Well...

731
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:58,840
My father's murderer...

732
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:00,440
Oh! What do you want to know?

733
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:02,400
What is that you want to know?

734
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:05,200
Why are you torturing me?

735
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:14,920
Come here

736
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:16,800
Come with me

737
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:20,160
Sit here

738
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:21,760
I said, sit

739
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:26,000
Hope your mom is doing well

740
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:27,520
Hope college is going good

741
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:29,880
Are you practicing football regularly?

742
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:31,920
Jaya, is working at the factory, right?

743
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:32,640
Yes...

744
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:35,200
What will you do after finding
out your dad's murderer?

745
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:38,240
- Well, my dad's...
- Study, play hard and become successful!

746
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:40,160
That's what must be running
in your mind! Got it?

747
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:43,000
Don't you confuse and torture
yourself unnecessarily!

748
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:44,000
Now, leave!

749
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:44,960
Listen!

750
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:47,120
I'm unable to play like before!

751
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:49,600
Who killed my father?

752
00:51:57,960 --> 00:51:59,640
If I tell you,
will you finish him off?

753
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:00,600
Yes, I will

754
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:05,880
Guess, who could it be

755
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:11,360
Just tell me, who is it?

756
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:15,160
Councilor Dhanasekar!

757
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:20,040
Do you know, what a
player my friend was?

758
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:31,120
Why have second thoughts?
Imagine, you'll get 0.3 millions

759
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:33,360
They took advantage of
your dad's poverty...

760
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:37,640
and made him turn himself in
for the murder Dhanasekaran committed

761
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:41,040
Your father went to prison

762
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:44,680
But Shantha?
He became a successful player

763
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:47,440
After your father completed
prison time and came out...

764
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:52,080
Dhanasekaran took him in and
used him for all his illegal activities

765
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:55,600
I spoke to the minister. That
bank has agreed to give the loan

766
00:53:56,080 --> 00:53:58,000
Invest in my chit fund and
pay every month without fail

767
00:53:58,040 --> 00:54:01,920
I promise that in 3 years, each one
of you will become a boat owner

768
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:09,600
You borrow money from our boss,
Dhana and play Judas with him?

769
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:26,840
Hence, we come to an end to this prayer
session. All of you may take leave

770
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:30,440
In the name of the Father, and of the Son,
and of the Holy Spirit - Amen

771
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:34,920
Fine, I'll call you back later

772
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:37,880
Daddy, buy me some candles

773
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:40,920
- We've enough at home
- Come on. Let him buy it

774
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,280
Here. Go and buy it

775
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:43,800
Dear...

776
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:47,120
Jones keeps asking
what work do you do

777
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:48,920
Jones is now a grown up

778
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:51,680
Quit this rogue lifestyle

779
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:55,440
Why don't you think of doing some business?

780
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:57,080
So one day, your dad...

781
00:54:57,280 --> 00:55:00,840
quit working for Dhanasekaran,
just for your sake

782
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:03,280
He decided to set up a fast
food outlet of his own

783
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:04,680
- Hello
- Gopi...

784
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:06,680
- Tell me
- What happened? Did you inquire?

785
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:09,080
I went inquired at the shop you suggested

786
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:11,880
He paid up Rs. 50,000 less saying
that old jewels don't earn much

787
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:14,680
In any case, I still need 0.3
millions more for my food outlet

788
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:17,080
That too within a week

789
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:19,320
Ask David and Guna

790
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:22,520
Ask any of them and they think
he's asking without any hesitation...

791
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:25,560
and they avoid me without answering,
thinking I'll run away with the money

792
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:26,720
What can I do?

793
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:29,440
- Dhana?
- You mean my boss, Dhana?

794
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:31,800
Murugesan, who worked
under him for 20 years...

795
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:36,520
and he gave him only Rs. 10,000
for his daughter's wedding

796
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:40,440
I am running out of ideas.
My head is bursting

797
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:42,120
Whom else can we ask?

798
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:44,920
Give me some time. Let me think.
I'll get back to you later

799
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:46,160
Ok, fine

800
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:50,760
You! Stop disturbing us so early
with that irritating noise

801
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:52,320
Don't you have a better
time to do this?

802
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:54,120
Of course the noise will be irritating!

803
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:57,800
Aren't you getting paid Rs. 30,000
every month? I'm almost done here

804
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:03,640
The company that erected tower
were only ready to pay Rs.5000

805
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:06,480
I refused and convinced
them to pay Rs. 10,000

806
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:09,080
- Hope you are happy with the deal, Gopi
- Yes, boss.

807
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:12,960
For erecting the cell tower on my rooftop,
he collects Rs. 30,000 from that company

808
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,240
He cheated me by paying me just
Rs.10,000 out of it

809
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:16,800
I'm not letting this go so easy

810
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,440
You think he'll pay you
if you hold his collar?

811
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:22,680
He wants to make it big in politics

812
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:25,560
If he doesn't pay me that money,
I'll spoil his reputation around

813
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:27,240
How will that benefit us?

814
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:29,640
Will spoil his reputation; my foot

815
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:33,720
We require 0.3 million.
Think of an idea to get that

816
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:37,600
Dude, come let's go to the police

817
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:40,760
You very well know, how loyal I was,
to that fellow!

818
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:42,960
How could he even think of betraying me?

819
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:44,080
It's hurts, sir

820
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:45,880
Calm down. Come with me

821
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:50,240
Look here, Gopi, if your turn yourself
in then it'll also ruin your life

822
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:51,840
Don't be so furious

823
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:53,600
Let me talk to Dhana

824
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:56,360
How dare you tell our
boys that I betrayed you?

825
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:57,880
You think I don't know about it?

826
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:02,160
I thought you'll finally
come and confront me

827
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:03,920
But you went to the
police and turned...

828
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:06,640
Don't get upset, Dhana.
He's got a valid point

829
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:10,400
True! The tower deal is Rs.30,000/month.
I pay him only Rs.10,000. I'm not denying it

830
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:14,240
But every month, for past 7 years, I've been
depositing that 20,000 in my wife's account

831
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:15,320
For his sake!

832
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:18,320
Why deposit in your wife's account?

833
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:20,000
Sir, he is a prodigal;
very bad with saving money

834
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:23,440
Had I paid the full 30,000 every month,
he'll wipe it off all and become a pauper

835
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:24,600
With such a face!

836
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:30,000
Why didn't you say a word to me
regarding your outlet business plan?

837
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:34,000
Any idea how much I've saved for
you, in her account? Tell him!

838
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:36,240
Rs. 23,40,000!

839
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:38,560
Throw his money on his face.
Take it and leave!

840
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:39,960
- Ask him to leave!
- Boss! Boss!

841
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:45,280
He lied to your father that he had saved
up the money in his wife's account

842
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:46,720
He gained you father's trust back

843
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:48,720
Look, I know you for the past 16 years

844
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:52,080
You made a hasty decision
by involving the police

845
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:54,960
I considered you as
my very own, younger brother

846
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:58,200
There's a lot I had planned for you

847
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:02,120
Do you think I need your
money to run my family?

848
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:04,320
- Didn't it cross your mind?
- Forgive me, boss

849
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:05,440
My bad

850
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:08,960
Fine, I don't have any grudge.
My mind is clear

851
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:11,400
- Come, let's play
- Ok, boss

852
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:13,960
Mr. Neymar, we both
would also like to join

853
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,320
- Sure, boss
- Gopi, you play for the opponent team

854
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:20,680
Ask our boys to barge in!

855
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:22,440
Come on, Dhana. Pass it over here!

856
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:24,960
- Carry on, boss!
- Come, carry it through!

857
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:26,920
Hit it, Dhana! Hit it!

858
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:29,400
Goal! Awesome, boss!

859
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,360
Man mark!

860
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:33,840
Come on, man mark it!

861
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:34,760
Do it!

862
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:36,800
Guys, play the man-to-man
marking strategy!

863
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:41,200
Did you check that out?

864
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:46,440
To your positions!
To your positions!

865
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:10,880
The anger inside him because of your
father involving the police...

866
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:13,280
and his intention to have
all that money to himself

867
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:15,080
These things pushed Dhanasekar...

868
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:17,360
to murder your father!

869
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:43,200
They murdered him mercilessly,
right in front of my eyes

870
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:46,560
Gopi!

871
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:57,200
Gopi!

872
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:22,960
After your father's demise,
fearing you might get spoiled...

873
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:26,360
Your mother shifted from
Pulianthope to Vyasarpadi

874
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:28,520
She put you in a school
in the same locality

875
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:31,560
Study well, ok?

876
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:34,040
In order to prevent me from
blabbing this truth...

877
01:00:34,360 --> 01:00:36,640
Dhana threatened me in person

878
01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:39,160
In the name of being loyal
to your friendship...

879
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:42,400
if you blabber this truth anywhere...

880
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:46,720
your sisters' life will be ruined!

881
01:00:47,080 --> 01:00:48,960
Do not spare him, Jones!

882
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:55,520
Jones, look over there

883
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:58,600
He will turn up here every week
to collect the chit fund money

884
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:07,160
So, what have you decided?

885
01:01:08,560 --> 01:01:10,880
I won't rest until I finish him off

886
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:22,040
Stretch!

887
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:24,960
- Why are you late?
- Had to take care of some work

888
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:27,000
To the right!

889
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:34,240
Go!

890
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:26,080
Jones! Pass!

891
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:29,680
Shiva! Jones is doing it on purpose

892
01:02:29,720 --> 01:02:31,520
He has been playing rough for past 2 days

893
01:02:31,560 --> 01:02:33,320
Let's complaint it to our coach

894
01:02:40,280 --> 01:02:41,080
Jones...

895
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:42,480
come here

896
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:49,760
What's your problem?

897
01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:51,920
Nothing, coach

898
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:54,760
Run 5 rounds! Now!

899
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:26,480
They murdered your father
right in front of my eyes

900
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:35,640
Now, tell me, what's your problem?

901
01:03:35,840 --> 01:03:37,640
Can't you hear me? Answer me

902
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:39,360
I've been noticing for a week now

903
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:41,600
Arrogance of being a very good player?

904
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:45,320
You'll meet your match, even
better players in upcoming matches

905
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:46,920
Don't be over confident

906
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:51,720
Look, don't you drain your
personal frustration here!

907
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,800
Once you lose the arrogance, the
anger will subside automatically

908
01:03:54,920 --> 01:03:56,880
Now, go! Give me 5 more rounds

909
01:03:57,680 --> 01:04:00,560
No matter how much you make me run,
this anger won't subside so easy

910
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:04,120
What's you problem? Tell me! Answer me!

911
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:11,240
Hey!

912
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:13,280
Jones?

913
01:04:14,080 --> 01:04:15,200
Why are you crying?

914
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:17,400
Tell me, what happened?

915
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:18,520
Tell me

916
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:19,720
What happened?

917
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:23,800
Weren't we under the impression that my dad
died while playing in the ground. Isn't it?

918
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:24,600
Yeah

919
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:26,080
What about it?

920
01:04:27,560 --> 01:04:28,360
Tell me

921
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:31,000
He was murdered, coach!

922
01:04:54,040 --> 01:04:55,440
I won't spare him!

923
01:04:56,800 --> 01:04:58,320
Don't make any hasty decision

924
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:01,240
I have friends in the police department

925
01:05:01,720 --> 01:05:03,320
I'll handle this in a different way

926
01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:05,120
No, coach

927
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:09,240
I'll find inner peace
only if I murder him

928
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:10,080
Look!

929
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:14,040
You have a beautiful
future waiting for you

930
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:16,160
Don't you miss it

931
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:19,040
Then...

932
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:23,120
meeting Rajiv Gandhi and knowing
the truth about your dad...

933
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:26,400
Don't tell your mom know about it

934
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:29,600
Only the first time
you'll need a reason to commit a sin

935
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:31,040
Then it'll become a habit

936
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:39,040
I made you play the ball so that you
don't follow your dad's footsteps

937
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:42,280
Your life begins from this league

938
01:05:42,840 --> 01:05:43,800
Jones...

939
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:46,520
when you're about to begin this life...

940
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:49,200
please do not end up ruining it. Ok?

941
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:52,240
Ok, coach

942
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:11,960
So, boys...

943
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:15,280
coming July, the 1st division
league will begin

944
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:18,120
I have already told you all...

945
01:06:18,160 --> 01:06:20,480
1st division matches are
like your 12th grade exams

946
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:22,400
If you shine well now...

947
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:25,440
you'll get an opportunity to play for
Tamil Nadu and in Santhosh trophy

948
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:28,440
And from there you can also get
opportunity to play for the Indian team

949
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:32,200
And Jones! This is the most
important match of your life

950
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:34,680
Your future starts from this league

951
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:39,280
Hey, look, Shabir is here.
He looks furious

952
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:47,080
- Please. No!
- How dare you?

953
01:06:47,240 --> 01:06:48,560
Why are you beating me?

954
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:51,320
- Even after knowing me, how dare you?
- I didn't do anything

955
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:53,240
You!

956
01:06:53,640 --> 01:06:55,480
- Wait and watch
- Please, it hurts!

957
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,040
It hurts!

958
01:06:58,840 --> 01:06:59,840
- Die!
- Please! No!

959
01:06:59,880 --> 01:07:01,000
- Die!
- Please, I'm innocent

960
01:07:01,040 --> 01:07:02,840
- How dare you lay hands on my sister?
- I'm innocent!

961
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:04,240
Sana and Jones are in love!

962
01:07:04,280 --> 01:07:05,160
What?

963
01:07:10,040 --> 01:07:11,520
What do you mean?

964
01:07:12,080 --> 01:07:14,000
I swear! Sana and Jones are in love

965
01:07:14,680 --> 01:07:17,640
He laid his hands on her, in the bus,
and put the blame on me

966
01:07:27,080 --> 01:07:28,600
She is your classmate

967
01:07:28,760 --> 01:07:30,520
I'm sure you'll know

968
01:07:30,680 --> 01:07:31,880
You better spit the truth

969
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:34,120
They keep talking to each other
all the time in the class

970
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:35,880
They even have lunch together

971
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:37,880
I think it's true

972
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:04,760
Keep going! Go!

973
01:08:05,160 --> 01:08:07,120
Faster! Don't lose him

974
01:08:09,400 --> 01:08:10,200
Hello

975
01:08:10,680 --> 01:08:12,640
Dhana and Murugesan have
locked horns at SS market

976
01:08:12,680 --> 01:08:14,760
Best chance to finish him off!
No one will doubt you!

977
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:16,280
I'm on my way to the ground

978
01:08:16,320 --> 01:08:17,200
Damn it!

979
01:08:17,280 --> 01:08:18,920
Are you really Gopi's son?

980
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:22,360
He brutally murdered Gopi in front of me!

981
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:25,000
- I'm coming!
- Dude, what happened?

982
01:08:25,480 --> 01:08:26,920
Hold on! Where is he going now?

983
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:28,160
What happened? Wait!

984
01:08:28,240 --> 01:08:30,400
- He took a left!
- At least tell me, what is it?

985
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:32,760
Take that road! Follow him!

986
01:09:01,320 --> 01:09:02,400
Jones!

987
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:05,320
Miss this opportunity...

988
01:09:05,560 --> 01:09:08,040
then you'll never get
another chance to finish him off!

989
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:09,160
Don't miss this opportunity!

990
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:12,000
I've placed a weapon near
that meter box. Take it!

991
01:10:07,960 --> 01:10:09,080
Which station?

992
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:12,560
- Your name?
- Jones Dhiraviyam

993
01:10:13,400 --> 01:10:15,000
- Age?
- 19

994
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:43,720
Look at Shabir's
condition, bhai!

995
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:45,720
Sir, you aren't allowed here

996
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:47,080
Sheela! It's ok

997
01:10:47,200 --> 01:10:49,040
Doctor, what happened to my son?

998
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:51,640
He's got a severe wound
right next to his ear

999
01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:53,920
We took a scan. He has
internal hemorrhage

1000
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,840
Also, there is blood clot internally

1001
01:10:56,600 --> 01:10:58,840
We can tell you more only after surgery

1002
01:11:02,440 --> 01:11:03,800
Dear son, Shabir...

1003
01:11:06,120 --> 01:11:06,880
Dear son

1004
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:10,600
Please don't cry. I have informed Shantha.
He is on his way

1005
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:12,720
There. He has arrived

1006
01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:19,280
I told you already on that day...

1007
01:11:19,320 --> 01:11:22,360
My son doesn't need football!

1008
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:26,080
Tell me, buddy

1009
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:27,760
Who's Shantha here?

1010
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:29,160
It's me

1011
01:11:29,680 --> 01:11:31,680
I'll call you back. Ok?

1012
01:11:32,440 --> 01:11:34,720
- Are you Adyar Inspector John's friend
- Yes, sir

1013
01:11:34,760 --> 01:11:36,280
Inspector is calling you

1014
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:55,840
Please come

1015
01:11:56,960 --> 01:11:57,800
Hello, sir

1016
01:11:57,920 --> 01:12:00,120
Coach Shantha? Is that you?
Please, have a seat

1017
01:12:00,160 --> 01:12:01,080
Who is this lady?

1018
01:12:01,160 --> 01:12:03,680
She is Jones' mother

1019
01:12:03,720 --> 01:12:06,640
I spoke to John. Hence,
I haven't filed a case yet

1020
01:12:06,680 --> 01:12:08,840
- Thank you, sir
- What was the issue, sir?

1021
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,520
Fight over a girl!

1022
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:15,320
They locked horns and that
fellow tried to attack your son

1023
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:19,120
Your son hit him back and he is now lying
in a hospital, in critical condition

1024
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:21,760
His father is a big shot in their locality

1025
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:23,760
If that boy passes away...

1026
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:26,080
your son will have to
serve 7 year jail term

1027
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:31,840
"In the canvas of the God..."

1028
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:34,720
"you are a divine portrait"

1029
01:12:35,360 --> 01:12:41,040
"And when the anger gets better of you,
you lose all your colors"

1030
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:47,720
"Initially the anger might seem huge,
but eventually it'll shrink down"

1031
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:50,440
"Have patience"

1032
01:12:50,760 --> 01:12:53,800
"Have patience"

1033
01:12:54,400 --> 01:13:00,040
"Heart is not the kind of
character that carries a grudge"

1034
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:05,400
"Life is a one way street, do not forget"

1035
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:12,240
"Remember that even a
smallest of mistake can take away a life"

1036
01:13:12,280 --> 01:13:17,480
"Do not forget this
life lesson, oh dear"

1037
01:13:18,360 --> 01:13:24,480
"Remember even your shadow can betray you"

1038
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:29,720
"Do not forget this
life lesson, oh dear"

1039
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:35,080
Hold this

1040
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:36,640
The surgery was successful, sir

1041
01:13:36,680 --> 01:13:38,560
Your son is out of danger

1042
01:13:38,600 --> 01:13:40,800
- Nothing to worry. Take care
- Ok, doctor

1043
01:13:40,840 --> 01:13:42,320
- Wait here. Bhai...
- Insha Allah!

1044
01:13:43,240 --> 01:13:44,280
- Bhai...
- Dhana?

1045
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:46,080
- How are you, bhai?
- Come, Dhana...

1046
01:13:46,280 --> 01:13:47,160
I'm fine

1047
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:50,920
- What the update on Shabir's condition?
- He is fine now

1048
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:52,560
Well, bhai...

1049
01:13:53,920 --> 01:13:55,960
The boy who injured Shabir...

1050
01:13:56,600 --> 01:13:58,080
is someone very close to me

1051
01:14:02,920 --> 01:14:04,560
His mother is here to meet you

1052
01:14:05,120 --> 01:14:06,680
Jaya! Come here!

1053
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:08,040
Come

1054
01:14:10,120 --> 01:14:11,040
Sir!

1055
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:12,840
Get up! Just, get up!

1056
01:14:15,480 --> 01:14:18,360
Sir, my son didn't do it intentionally

1057
01:14:18,440 --> 01:14:20,360
He committed a blunder out of innocence

1058
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:29,160
Even few moments ago, I was at
the church praying for your son

1059
01:14:33,240 --> 01:14:36,360
Please have a heart and forgive my son

1060
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:39,480
Please forgive him! Please!

1061
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:49,160
Iqbal, take back the complaint filed

1062
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:52,520
We'd like to take back our complaint

1063
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:56,720
Please sign here

1064
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:00,680
Fine, take care of it

1065
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:04,040
Give me some water

1066
01:15:09,080 --> 01:15:10,800
What did they say, Jaya?

1067
01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:13,800
They took back the complaint

1068
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:15,240
Thanks a lot

1069
01:15:15,320 --> 01:15:18,080
Dhana, you saved his life

1070
01:15:18,200 --> 01:15:21,480
He'll be thankful to you his
whole life for what you just did for him

1071
01:15:21,680 --> 01:15:24,600
Shantha, I just took you guys to bhai

1072
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,120
Bhai let him go because
of the sympathy on Jaya

1073
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:29,680
Auditor is calling. Attend
and check what's the matter

1074
01:15:40,040 --> 01:15:42,360
- Fine, we shall make a move now
- Ok

1075
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:44,720
Come home tomorrow for lunch

1076
01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:55,320
Bring your son too

1077
01:15:56,200 --> 01:15:57,280
Ok

1078
01:15:58,120 --> 01:16:00,480
- Shantha, why don't you join too?
- Ok

1079
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:02,400
See you

1080
01:16:06,120 --> 01:16:07,520
Ok, let's go

1081
01:16:09,680 --> 01:16:10,640
Get in

1082
01:16:11,120 --> 01:16:12,440
You! Come on!

1083
01:16:16,840 --> 01:16:18,400
Dear Jesus...

1084
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:23,520
for the sins that I committed
with and without my knowledge...

1085
01:16:23,560 --> 01:16:25,880
please forgive and bless me

1086
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:27,080
Amen

1087
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:30,400
Let me take that

1088
01:16:35,480 --> 01:16:37,040
If not in studies...

1089
01:16:37,200 --> 01:16:39,880
I thought at least through
football he'll become a successful

1090
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:42,440
We don't want any issues again

1091
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:45,480
Please put some sense into him

1092
01:16:52,160 --> 01:16:52,880
Fine

1093
01:16:53,280 --> 01:16:54,520
What's your plan?

1094
01:16:54,960 --> 01:16:55,960
Sorry, coach

1095
01:16:56,120 --> 01:16:58,760
I won't poke my nose in that
girl's issue ever again

1096
01:17:00,040 --> 01:17:01,880
Don't you lie to me
like you did to others

1097
01:17:02,120 --> 01:17:05,320
Anand told me why you went there
and what took place instead

1098
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:07,840
Hope you saw your mother's innocent face

1099
01:17:08,240 --> 01:17:10,720
No matter what, you won't change, right?

1100
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
If something had happened
to that guy yesterday...

1101
01:17:14,040 --> 01:17:16,160
you'd be in prison and your
mother would've passed away

1102
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:17,960
No way, coach

1103
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:21,080
If Shabir hadn't played spoilsport,
Dhana would've been dead by now

1104
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:24,480
I would've finished him off secretly,
exactly the way he murdered my dad

1105
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:27,160
No one would've found out that I did it

1106
01:17:28,320 --> 01:17:30,120
But you'd know right?

1107
01:17:30,520 --> 01:17:33,280
Won't the guilt trouble you
after finishing him off?

1108
01:17:33,320 --> 01:17:35,000
Then can you ever play like before?

1109
01:17:37,120 --> 01:17:39,600
I have been awestruck by many
players while watching them on TV

1110
01:17:39,640 --> 01:17:41,320
But in person...

1111
01:17:42,080 --> 01:17:43,600
only a few have impressed me

1112
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:46,040
And in your age group, only you!

1113
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:49,280
You are something special by nature

1114
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:52,400
I'm unable to deal with it, coach

1115
01:17:53,200 --> 01:17:56,320
I'm unable to control the
rage in me to kill him!

1116
01:17:57,320 --> 01:18:01,120
Your mom fell at that girl's father feet
and pleaded to him

1117
01:18:01,160 --> 01:18:03,120
She has got you a second chance in life

1118
01:18:03,720 --> 01:18:06,000
A woman, struggling all by herself...

1119
01:18:06,160 --> 01:18:09,280
and to raise a son like you, do
you've any idea how difficult it is?

1120
01:18:11,560 --> 01:18:12,640
Fortunately...

1121
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:16,120
Dhanasekar is unaware of all this.
Good for you

1122
01:18:20,240 --> 01:18:20,960
Fine...

1123
01:18:21,240 --> 01:18:22,600
I'm asking you for the final time

1124
01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:24,640
Are you going to fulfill
your father's dream?

1125
01:18:24,680 --> 01:18:28,280
Or are you going to kill him and punish
your innocent mother by ruining your life?

1126
01:18:33,080 --> 01:18:34,280
Just...get lost!

1127
01:19:13,680 --> 01:19:15,040
How's Shabir now?

1128
01:19:15,440 --> 01:19:17,040
We brought him back to home

1129
01:19:17,160 --> 01:19:19,440
The doctor has advised him 15 days rest

1130
01:19:22,760 --> 01:19:24,960
Shall I come to your home
and pay him a visit?

1131
01:19:25,080 --> 01:19:26,240
No! No need!

1132
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:28,800
My family has doubts about us

1133
01:19:28,920 --> 01:19:30,120
What doubts?

1134
01:19:30,680 --> 01:19:33,080
They doubt if we both are in love

1135
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:40,640
Tell Shabir that there
is nothing between us

1136
01:19:51,320 --> 01:19:53,440
Goal! Yay!

1137
01:19:53,520 --> 01:19:54,640
Jones!

1138
01:19:54,720 --> 01:19:55,680
Coach?

1139
01:19:58,040 --> 01:19:59,040
Yes, coach?

1140
01:19:59,440 --> 01:20:00,120
Here, talk

1141
01:20:00,440 --> 01:20:01,560
Who's on the call, coach?

1142
01:20:01,640 --> 01:20:03,400
You aren't going to pay
heed to our advice

1143
01:20:03,440 --> 01:20:06,280
You'll pay heed only if the
right person advises. Now, talk

1144
01:20:11,120 --> 01:20:12,200
Hello, who's this?

1145
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:13,960
Hello

1146
01:20:16,360 --> 01:20:17,280
Jones!

1147
01:20:18,320 --> 01:20:19,320
Who's this?

1148
01:20:19,880 --> 01:20:21,600
It's me, Pavithra

1149
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:25,040
Pavithra!

1150
01:20:28,680 --> 01:20:29,800
How are you?

1151
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:32,960
How's your mom doing?

1152
01:20:34,520 --> 01:20:38,720
I heard you haven't cleared you
Economic paper. You better clear it

1153
01:20:40,920 --> 01:20:44,440
Only if you complete your degree, you'll be
eligible to apply for jobs under sports quota

1154
01:20:44,520 --> 01:20:45,200
Ok

1155
01:20:46,040 --> 01:20:48,320
I'll be waiting for you, Jones

1156
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:49,520
All the best

1157
01:20:50,080 --> 01:20:52,160
- Bye
- Thanks, Pavithra

1158
01:20:59,320 --> 01:21:00,880
Everything ok, his highness?

1159
01:21:02,680 --> 01:21:04,160
Back to the game, go!

1160
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:14,080
Buddy...

1161
01:21:14,480 --> 01:21:16,800
How did coach find out about Pavithra?

1162
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:18,560
It was me who told him

1163
01:21:18,880 --> 01:21:20,120
You told him?

1164
01:21:20,440 --> 01:21:22,960
Then how did coach
get her number?

1165
01:21:23,440 --> 01:21:25,920
- Again, it was me
- You gave him her number?

1166
01:21:26,160 --> 01:21:28,040
- Dude! Dude!
- How did you get her number?

1167
01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:30,920
Pavithra has been in touch with me.
She inquires about you every day

1168
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:34,320
She said she'll stop calling me if you find
out. That's why I had to keep is a secret

1169
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:35,280
Sorry dude

1170
01:21:35,640 --> 01:21:38,280
- Take your hands off. I won't hit you
- Buddy...

1171
01:21:38,600 --> 01:21:39,480
Buddy, please...

1172
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:41,400
Buddy!

1173
01:21:59,800 --> 01:22:01,760
Dhamu! Why did Jones come
to the market other day?

1174
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:02,880
I don't know!

1175
01:22:03,400 --> 01:22:04,920
- Drown him! Like that!
- Speak up!

1176
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:06,920
- Speak up or else...
- That's all I know

1177
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:07,760
I'll drown you here

1178
01:22:07,800 --> 01:22:09,640
- He's just repeating the same
- Drown him!

1179
01:22:09,720 --> 01:22:11,120
- David!
- Coming, boss

1180
01:22:11,480 --> 01:22:13,840
Don't stop. Continue. I'll be back

1181
01:22:14,040 --> 01:22:14,840
What is he saying?

1182
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:18,040
Boss, Jones had been to
Perambur ground in his bike

1183
01:22:19,400 --> 01:22:22,360
He got a call and so midway he changed
direction and came to the market

1184
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:25,720
But this boy has no idea about
who called him and for what

1185
01:22:26,120 --> 01:22:30,160
Boss, I saw him ten days
ago near the liquor shop

1186
01:22:30,200 --> 01:22:32,880
He was messing with that man, Rajiv Gandhi

1187
01:22:50,480 --> 01:22:51,640
What's up, Gandhi?

1188
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:55,200
Looks like you're done

1189
01:22:56,360 --> 01:22:59,800
Come on, friend. Let's begin again

1190
01:23:02,920 --> 01:23:04,840
Listen! Gandhi!

1191
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:06,640
- Tell me
- Don't turn your head at once

1192
01:23:07,320 --> 01:23:08,760
I'm here to spy on you

1193
01:23:11,960 --> 01:23:13,400
Dhana sent me

1194
01:23:14,760 --> 01:23:16,080
Our boys will come now

1195
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:19,240
They'll try to bait you and pull
out the truth. Don't you fall for it

1196
01:23:19,280 --> 01:23:21,600
Didn't you tell Jones, the
truth about his dad's death?

1197
01:23:21,640 --> 01:23:23,080
Boss has a small doubt on you

1198
01:23:23,560 --> 01:23:25,040
Quiet. It's my boss

1199
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:27,640
Yes boss

1200
01:23:27,680 --> 01:23:28,520
Reached?

1201
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:30,960
- Yes, I did
- Put the phone in speaker mode

1202
01:23:31,280 --> 01:23:33,280
Ok, boss. Stay on the line

1203
01:23:36,400 --> 01:23:37,560
What's up, Gandhi?

1204
01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:40,040
Are you done for the night?

1205
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:42,440
How about one more large?

1206
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:48,160
- Pour me also a drink
- How are you, Gandhi?

1207
01:23:49,560 --> 01:23:51,800
Of late you're not to
be seen around, Gandhi?

1208
01:23:56,320 --> 01:23:57,720
David, first pour for him

1209
01:23:57,800 --> 01:23:59,480
You! Order some side dish

1210
01:24:03,160 --> 01:24:03,920
Gandhi...

1211
01:24:04,640 --> 01:24:06,600
Goldstar Gopi's son...

1212
01:24:06,720 --> 01:24:08,680
came to our boss asking for a job

1213
01:24:10,280 --> 01:24:12,360
Is he old enough to go for a job?

1214
01:24:13,520 --> 01:24:14,960
Haven't you met him?

1215
01:24:16,280 --> 01:24:20,360
- I did, back when he was a kid
- Now he is a grown up

1216
01:24:23,800 --> 01:24:26,080
I'd have known if I had
married and had a family

1217
01:24:27,800 --> 01:24:29,760
Time just flies

1218
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:33,720
Poor Gandhi, he is innocent

1219
01:24:34,520 --> 01:24:36,920
Gandhi, enough. Go home

1220
01:24:37,080 --> 01:24:38,280
Don't get wasted. See you

1221
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:40,360
Gandhi, go home safe

1222
01:24:40,400 --> 01:24:41,920
- See you, Gandhi
- See you!

1223
01:24:44,040 --> 01:24:46,480
Don't point at him.
You must have seen someone else

1224
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:01,520
- Naveen...
- Yes Gandhi?

1225
01:25:03,400 --> 01:25:05,840
- Hope they didn't get any doubt on me
- No. Not at all

1226
01:25:08,240 --> 01:25:09,360
By the way...

1227
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:14,040
how did Dhana come to know that
I told everything to Jones?

1228
01:25:14,080 --> 01:25:16,120
Gandhi! You just said it

1229
01:25:18,240 --> 01:25:21,680
- Time's up! All of you leave
- Leave, all of you!

1230
01:25:21,720 --> 01:25:23,120
You all heard us! Leave!

1231
01:25:26,240 --> 01:25:27,200
Sit down

1232
01:25:28,480 --> 01:25:29,520
I said, sit down

1233
01:25:37,080 --> 01:25:38,360
So, this is your brand?

1234
01:25:39,680 --> 01:25:42,440
The same brand for the past 20 years.
Never changed it!

1235
01:25:42,960 --> 01:25:45,960
This brand is what suits us, Gandhi.
It doesn't give us a hangover

1236
01:26:57,160 --> 01:26:58,920
Brother Rajiv Gandhi's
death smells fishy to me

1237
01:26:58,960 --> 01:27:01,840
I don't think he would've accidentally
fell off into the sewage, coach

1238
01:27:02,680 --> 01:27:03,400
Then?

1239
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,800
Rajiv Gandhi told me the
truth about my dad's death

1240
01:27:07,160 --> 01:27:08,880
I doubt if Dhana found out that

1241
01:27:10,640 --> 01:27:14,120
In that case, Dhana would've finished you
off first. Don't confuse yourself

1242
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:17,040
- Hello
- Hello, Jones...

1243
01:27:17,080 --> 01:27:18,400
Have your started back to home?

1244
01:27:18,440 --> 01:27:19,800
Yes, I'm on my way, mom

1245
01:27:20,240 --> 01:27:22,680
- I'll be at home in half an hour
- Ok

1246
01:27:22,720 --> 01:27:24,960
I'm preparing mutton dish.
Bring coach, Shantha along

1247
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:25,720
Ok, mom

1248
01:27:25,880 --> 01:27:27,160
I'll bring him along

1249
01:27:27,360 --> 01:27:29,680
Do you want me to buy something
from Sundari's shop?

1250
01:27:29,720 --> 01:27:31,800
- Dude!
- What happened?

1251
01:27:31,960 --> 01:27:33,400
Hello, Jones?

1252
01:27:35,480 --> 01:27:36,920
What happened? Are you ok?

1253
01:27:37,520 --> 01:27:39,080
- Get up
- I'm fine

1254
01:27:39,320 --> 01:27:40,800
Hello! Answer me! Hello!

1255
01:27:41,720 --> 01:27:42,760
What happened, Jones?

1256
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:44,720
Nothing to worry. Everything's fine

1257
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:48,440
- Are you fine?
- Answer me! Hello!

1258
01:27:49,280 --> 01:27:51,160
Nothing to worry. Everything's fine

1259
01:27:51,720 --> 01:27:53,120
Jones! What happened?

1260
01:27:54,040 --> 01:27:55,800
Hello! Jones! What happened?

1261
01:27:55,960 --> 01:27:58,600
Mom, a car guy rammed onto my bike
rear, from the side. Nothing to worry

1262
01:27:58,640 --> 01:27:59,840
I hope you are safe

1263
01:27:59,920 --> 01:28:02,200
Yes mom. Nothing to worry. I'm on my way.
Now, hang up!

1264
01:28:02,240 --> 01:28:04,760
- I'll bring the coach along
- Hello! Listen...

1265
01:28:20,120 --> 01:28:21,400
- Give me that
- Yes boss

1266
01:28:21,440 --> 01:28:24,320
My wife has sent Rice
flour dumplings for Jones

1267
01:28:24,400 --> 01:28:25,600
Do give it to your son

1268
01:28:26,280 --> 01:28:27,200
Take it

1269
01:28:32,720 --> 01:28:35,040
What are you wondering?
Now, switch on the fan

1270
01:28:39,800 --> 01:28:42,280
Stop wondering and
make tea for my men

1271
01:29:04,400 --> 01:29:06,680
No, thanks. Please serve
our men waiting outside

1272
01:29:24,200 --> 01:29:24,960
Jaya...

1273
01:29:25,600 --> 01:29:28,520
Looks like Jones isn't take usual
'Water tank' route to the ground

1274
01:29:29,680 --> 01:29:32,400
Looks like he takes the market road.
My boys told me

1275
01:29:33,640 --> 01:29:36,280
Ask him to stay safe. After
all, that issue involves a girl

1276
01:29:36,360 --> 01:29:39,400
They might seem to be quiet but
will have heart full of vengeance

1277
01:29:39,440 --> 01:29:40,920
They'll finish him of silently

1278
01:29:41,880 --> 01:29:43,520
Look what happened to our friend,
Rajiv Gandhi

1279
01:29:43,560 --> 01:29:45,480
Don't know why, someone
finished him off

1280
01:29:45,560 --> 01:29:47,720
What's the use lamenting after dying?

1281
01:29:47,800 --> 01:29:49,960
Anything can happen in
a fraction of a second

1282
01:29:53,280 --> 01:29:54,080
Now...

1283
01:29:55,120 --> 01:29:56,760
There is Gopi's photo

1284
01:29:57,240 --> 01:29:58,360
Step forward, Jaya

1285
01:29:58,560 --> 01:30:02,760
Now, next to Gopi's photo
we'll have Jones'...

1286
01:30:07,280 --> 01:30:09,960
Doofus! Why are you looking
like you've seen a ghost?

1287
01:30:11,800 --> 01:30:14,040
I meant frame and hang Jones' certificate

1288
01:30:14,960 --> 01:30:17,680
It's a big deal to make to
the 2nd division in football

1289
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,880
Oh God! Totally forgot
about why I came here

1290
01:30:25,200 --> 01:30:26,240
Go ahead, tell her

1291
01:30:26,480 --> 01:30:31,080
The RBT tower erected at your house
in Pulianthope has become too old

1292
01:30:31,120 --> 01:30:34,080
- Now, a new one must be...
- Stop beating around the bush!

1293
01:30:34,640 --> 01:30:35,800
Look here, Jaya...

1294
01:30:36,320 --> 01:30:38,960
The lease period of the tower,
in that house of your's, is over

1295
01:30:39,120 --> 01:30:40,480
I need to extend it

1296
01:30:41,040 --> 01:30:42,960
I've ordered to get the documents ready

1297
01:30:43,400 --> 01:30:44,880
All it needs is your signature

1298
01:30:45,560 --> 01:30:47,200
Either say that
you'll let us have it

1299
01:30:47,960 --> 01:30:49,840
Or you buy it from us

1300
01:30:54,800 --> 01:30:56,720
Sir, I was just dealing about your matter

1301
01:30:56,800 --> 01:30:59,160
As promised, I sealed the
deal on Gopi's house itself

1302
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:00,160
Just a minute, sir

1303
01:31:00,200 --> 01:31:02,080
What's up, Jones? Back from the ground?

1304
01:31:02,120 --> 01:31:02,800
Yes

1305
01:31:02,840 --> 01:31:04,000
What's up, Shantha?

1306
01:31:05,800 --> 01:31:07,800
How's our boy? Is he in good form?

1307
01:31:08,440 --> 01:31:09,760
He's an excellent player

1308
01:31:13,040 --> 01:31:15,040
Don't lose your focus

1309
01:31:21,480 --> 01:31:24,360
I'll inform you by tonight on
when the registration will happen

1310
01:31:24,400 --> 01:31:25,320
Ok, sir

1311
01:31:25,400 --> 01:31:26,240
Ok

1312
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:33,880
Mom!

1313
01:31:34,480 --> 01:31:35,640
What does he want?

1314
01:31:36,120 --> 01:31:37,520
Why was he here?

1315
01:31:39,080 --> 01:31:40,240
Can't you hear me?

1316
01:31:41,640 --> 01:31:43,160
He wants to buy our old house

1317
01:31:43,200 --> 01:31:44,960
- And?
- I said I'm ready to sell it to him

1318
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,040
Why would you let him buy our house?

1319
01:31:47,520 --> 01:31:48,800
Any idea, what he did?

1320
01:31:52,040 --> 01:31:54,480
I know he's the one who
murdered your father

1321
01:31:58,880 --> 01:32:00,200
I knew it already

1322
01:32:05,160 --> 01:32:06,600
Even though I knew it...

1323
01:32:07,720 --> 01:32:11,440
I moved away from there and
came here just for your sake

1324
01:32:11,480 --> 01:32:14,000
I didn't want you to
fall in his eyesight

1325
01:32:14,960 --> 01:32:18,400
Now, you tired attacking him and that's
what made him come to our home, so far

1326
01:32:22,160 --> 01:32:24,160
If you again think of finishing him off...

1327
01:32:25,120 --> 01:32:26,760
then it'll be over my dead body

1328
01:32:30,040 --> 01:32:31,720
Mom, make it fast

1329
01:32:31,760 --> 01:32:33,080
- Come
- Coming

1330
01:32:33,120 --> 01:32:34,200
Collect the documents

1331
01:32:34,680 --> 01:32:36,720
Wait, face towards the east side

1332
01:32:37,080 --> 01:32:37,880
Good

1333
01:32:40,400 --> 01:32:41,800
Hand it over to my mother, Jaya

1334
01:32:44,120 --> 01:32:46,600
Keep it near the
God's idol and pray

1335
01:32:46,680 --> 01:32:47,480
Ok, dear

1336
01:32:48,240 --> 01:32:49,640
I'm very happy, Jaya

1337
01:32:49,720 --> 01:32:50,560
Brother...

1338
01:32:51,400 --> 01:32:55,440
My husband died on the ground

1339
01:32:55,880 --> 01:32:57,840
 I very well know why and how he died

1340
01:32:59,480 --> 01:33:03,800
The reason I left this locality right
after his death was just because...

1341
01:33:03,880 --> 01:33:06,760
I wanted my son to lead a
happy and successful life

1342
01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:07,800
Even now...

1343
01:33:07,960 --> 01:33:12,560
the reason behind I'm letting you buy
my house, which is dear to me...

1344
01:33:12,880 --> 01:33:16,080
is because I still want my son to
have a happy and successful life

1345
01:33:19,720 --> 01:33:21,760
Please, nothing bad should happen to him

1346
01:33:29,880 --> 01:33:30,680
Boss...

1347
01:33:31,320 --> 01:33:34,800
I thought she'll refuse to sell
the house and lose her son

1348
01:33:35,040 --> 01:33:39,040
She is smart. She sold the
house and saved her son

1349
01:33:42,280 --> 01:33:43,480
I know...

1350
01:33:44,200 --> 01:33:45,840
that you'll finish me off

1351
01:33:47,800 --> 01:33:49,040
Go ahead

1352
01:33:53,320 --> 01:33:54,640
But one thing...

1353
01:33:55,960 --> 01:33:58,360
He won't rest until he finishes you off

1354
01:34:04,120 --> 01:34:06,880
He won't rest until he finishes you off!

1355
01:34:10,040 --> 01:34:12,080
Once the house registration is done...

1356
01:34:12,920 --> 01:34:14,760
- Finish him off!
- Ok, boss

1357
01:34:19,440 --> 01:34:20,760
No, sir. Not in my name

1358
01:34:21,240 --> 01:34:23,040
I'm registering it in my wife's name

1359
01:34:23,280 --> 01:34:23,960
Boss...

1360
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,480
Do the necessary formalities
to extend the tower

1361
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:30,200
Tomorrow's the 1st division match.
So, I'm out with the boys for lunch

1362
01:34:30,680 --> 01:34:31,520
Ok

1363
01:34:31,920 --> 01:34:33,720
Ok. We'll meet up tomorrow

1364
01:34:35,480 --> 01:34:36,480
So, boys...

1365
01:34:37,120 --> 01:34:39,400
tomorrow we play our 1st
match against FCDAV

1366
01:34:39,440 --> 01:34:42,520
So, first thing tomorrow morning, be
there at the ground at sharp 5:30 am

1367
01:34:42,560 --> 01:34:43,760
Ok, coach

1368
01:34:43,800 --> 01:34:45,400
We'll train for an hour

1369
01:34:45,440 --> 01:34:46,560
Then head to the match

1370
01:34:47,120 --> 01:34:48,400
Ok, coach

1371
01:34:49,480 --> 01:34:51,880
- Are our boys ready?
- Yes, boss

1372
01:34:51,920 --> 01:34:52,400
Hello

1373
01:34:52,440 --> 01:34:55,280
Our men are going to finish off Jones.
Save him, if you can

1374
01:34:57,240 --> 01:34:58,360
Hello! Hello!

1375
01:34:59,640 --> 01:35:00,440
Hello!

1376
01:35:04,600 --> 01:35:05,600
Tell me, coach

1377
01:35:06,080 --> 01:35:08,120
- Where are you?
- On my way to the ground, coach

1378
01:35:08,160 --> 01:35:09,360
Dhana's men have targeted you

1379
01:35:09,400 --> 01:35:11,240
Come to the border park. I'll come there

1380
01:35:11,280 --> 01:35:12,760
What are you saying, coach?

1381
01:35:29,680 --> 01:35:31,080
Round him up, guys!

1382
01:35:58,240 --> 01:35:59,480
Dhana!

1383
01:36:02,240 --> 01:36:03,800
Please! No!

1384
01:36:04,200 --> 01:36:06,920
Please don't harm. Let go of him!

1385
01:36:09,880 --> 01:36:12,200
Please tell your men not to hurt Jones!

1386
01:36:12,760 --> 01:36:13,920
Please, no!

1387
01:36:14,360 --> 01:36:15,120
Please, no!

1388
01:36:15,320 --> 01:36:16,720
Please! Please, no!

1389
01:36:16,760 --> 01:36:18,680
What's the problem?

1390
01:36:18,720 --> 01:36:21,960
Didn't his mother sell their house
to you as per your orders

1391
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:23,280
Then what's the issue?

1392
01:36:24,720 --> 01:36:25,880
Drop the knife!

1393
01:36:26,240 --> 01:36:28,120
Please, no. He won't
come in your way anymore

1394
01:36:28,160 --> 01:36:30,080
He won't give you any problems. I swear!

1395
01:36:30,120 --> 01:36:30,800
What if he does?

1396
01:36:30,880 --> 01:36:32,560
I guarantee you. He won't!

1397
01:36:32,640 --> 01:36:34,040
He won't even appear
in front of you

1398
01:36:34,080 --> 01:36:37,640
Trust me! He won't. Please, leave

1399
01:36:39,720 --> 01:36:41,000
Drop the knife!

1400
01:36:41,040 --> 01:36:42,800
- I didn't do anything, coach
- Drop it!

1401
01:36:42,840 --> 01:36:43,760
No coach!

1402
01:36:43,800 --> 01:36:45,160
I didn't do anything!

1403
01:36:48,560 --> 01:36:49,360
Coach!

1404
01:36:51,560 --> 01:36:52,440
Coach!

1405
01:36:56,640 --> 01:36:57,520
Coach...

1406
01:36:58,200 --> 01:36:59,120
Coach...

1407
01:37:02,600 --> 01:37:04,760
How are you so sure
he won't come for me?

1408
01:37:05,800 --> 01:37:07,640
Once the heart is filled
with vengeance...

1409
01:37:07,880 --> 01:37:09,440
it will stay strong until death

1410
01:37:11,360 --> 01:37:12,880
I know you'll show up if he dies

1411
01:37:12,920 --> 01:37:14,360
I wanted to finish you off too

1412
01:37:14,400 --> 01:37:16,960
That's why I used him as
bait and got you here

1413
01:37:18,640 --> 01:37:19,960
Give it to me

1414
01:37:24,120 --> 01:37:25,520
I said, give it to me!

1415
01:38:53,160 --> 01:38:54,320
Coach...

1416
01:39:12,960 --> 01:39:13,880
Come on...

1417
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:15,920
Come on...

1418
01:39:45,200 --> 01:39:46,360
Coach

1419
01:40:15,440 --> 01:40:16,760
Jones Dhiraviyam...

1420
01:40:16,840 --> 01:40:17,480
Sir...

1421
01:40:17,520 --> 01:40:19,440
You are going to be an Indian player

1422
01:40:19,760 --> 01:40:20,640
Sure, sir

1423
01:40:23,800 --> 01:40:24,640
Now, go

1424
01:40:28,360 --> 01:40:30,880
It's getting late. Quick! Go!

1425
01:41:02,760 --> 01:41:08,720
Like me, every youth from North Madras
will always have valor and  be daring!

1426
01:41:08,760 --> 01:41:13,120
But we can't afford to buy a
football or a jersey or soccer boots

1427
01:41:13,160 --> 01:41:15,240
This poverty is our first problem

1428
01:41:15,280 --> 01:41:18,840
Second, we don't get good nutritious food
after becoming exhausted from playing

1429
01:41:18,880 --> 01:41:22,320
Third, the stamp of
'violence' on our back!

1430
01:41:22,400 --> 01:41:25,280
Every North Madras youth,
like me, who crosses...

1431
01:41:25,320 --> 01:41:27,840
these 3 problems and
steps in the ground...

1432
01:41:28,040 --> 01:41:29,120
is a CHAMPION!
