1
00:05:09,586 --> 00:05:14,353
Please don't. Don't beat me. Let me go...
Don't... Don't.

2
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:22,759
Don't . Narasimham! Don't kill me.
Don't kill me.

3
00:05:27,504 --> 00:05:30,598
"Hey, Little brother
You got a bonny baby girl".

4
00:05:39,716 --> 00:05:44,244
Go tell that Bapineedu... I spared your life
in the joy of my daughter's birth...

5
00:05:50,294 --> 00:05:53,058
"What man, all these crowds flocking in their
carts like it's some festival".

6
00:05:54,598 --> 00:05:56,293
Don't you know?
Neelakantham Naidu got a daughter...

7
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,130
It was proclaimed in the nearby villages.
People are coming in carts to attend...

8
00:05:59,202 --> 00:06:03,605
The naming ceremony
.You know what a big man he is...

9
00:06:07,077 --> 00:06:08,942
Move fast... What's the delay.
Put them down there.

10
00:06:12,382 --> 00:06:16,011
"Listen, the baby's features are
just like the Madam, aren't they?"

11
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:20,412
"Look closely! Those eyes, that nose
...Look just like the masters'..."

12
00:06:21,091 --> 00:06:26,427
"Oh, no. Look at her smile, like the
goddess of prosperity, just like her mother".

13
00:06:27,097 --> 00:06:29,429
"No, she's like the Master...
No, She's just like Madam."

14
00:06:30,767 --> 00:06:33,793
No... That's what bugs me.
What does it matter whose features?

15
00:06:34,504 --> 00:06:36,765
" If at least this one lives on, she
may do well even with my features."

16
00:06:39,543 --> 00:06:42,671
"Till now four babies born,
and died in birth."

17
00:06:44,114 --> 00:06:46,810
Wondering how this one's fate turns out
...there my brother is sitting...

18
00:06:47,017 --> 00:06:49,110
" .With the astrologers, greatly worried."

19
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:55,488
"Tell me, sir.
What do the stars foresay of the baby?"

20
00:06:56,126 --> 00:06:59,562
Ah! Neelakantham sir! her birth star
indicates your girl has great future...

21
00:07:01,832 --> 00:07:03,959
"Wherever she is, all wealth flows to her."

22
00:07:07,804 --> 00:07:11,570
"The six planets resting in ninth, tenth
and eleventh houses, with four of them"

23
00:07:12,943 --> 00:07:17,209
agreeing with the ruling star
all these good signs are evident...

24
00:07:19,016 --> 00:07:21,382
"In your daughter's horoscope.
Due to her good fortune, now you have"

25
00:07:22,586 --> 00:07:25,020
no fear of premature death.
You will live full hundred years.

26
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:42,399
"Sister, Sister, Sister .Did you hear
what the astrologers were saying?"

27
00:07:43,173 --> 00:07:45,334
What did they say?

28
00:07:45,509 --> 00:07:52,509
My daughter... My baby has great future.
She will be blessed with great wealth.

29
00:07:54,251 --> 00:07:58,517
"Because of her birth, My life span too has
increased. I'll live my full term."

30
00:07:59,923 --> 00:08:01,914
"My baby, my goddess, my manna from heaven,
my golden child."

31
00:08:05,495 --> 00:08:08,521
But... There's a threat to her life...
From "water"... as per her horoscope.

32
00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:18,539
Like the previous babies that died
this baby too has danger to her life

33
00:08:18,642 --> 00:08:21,110
until she attains the age of fifteen.

34
00:08:24,514 --> 00:08:27,108
You never know in what form...
Or from which side death will pounce.

35
00:08:29,186 --> 00:08:31,477
"So, for these fifteen years,
you have to protect her like your own life."

36
00:08:31,554 --> 00:08:36,521
No. Stop it! To my little goddess born
to save me from premature death.

37
00:08:36,626 --> 00:08:39,527
I can't bear the prospect of her death
Don't tell any more...

38
00:08:42,966 --> 00:08:45,400
I'll pray to you. Please tell us if there
is a way to save my baby from

39
00:08:45,469 --> 00:08:47,903
...the threat from water.

40
00:08:48,171 --> 00:08:51,231
"Please pardon me, lady.
Mere learning can not alter destiny."

41
00:08:51,408 --> 00:08:53,569
"if you can't alter fate,
what are you there for?"

42
00:08:53,777 --> 00:08:56,104
"No, don't say that, sir. There is an idea.
Though we can't change fate..."

43
00:08:57,114 --> 00:09:00,948
there is a way to do penance
for these defects in horoscope.

44
00:09:01,485 --> 00:09:04,511
Tell me what it is. Should I give alms?
Should I do sacrifices?

45
00:09:05,922 --> 00:09:08,049
Should I satisfy Gods? Tell me. I'll do!

46
00:09:08,492 --> 00:09:10,119
"No, it's not that easy.
It's a very difficult task."

47
00:09:12,696 --> 00:09:16,928
"No, it doesn't matter. if it will
save my child from this danger,"

48
00:09:17,267 --> 00:09:19,098
"I'll bear any cost,
any difficulty, tell me."

49
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:23,198
The birth place of the sacred Ganges
Gangotri! it's in the Himalayas.

50
00:09:24,908 --> 00:09:28,935
You should take this child and bathe her
in those waters on every...

51
00:09:30,514 --> 00:09:34,280
...birthday without fail.
If you do this for 15 years...

52
00:09:35,886 --> 00:09:38,616
The danger of water will... disappear.
She will live her full life.

53
00:09:42,526 --> 00:09:45,962
"Dear sir, to you who saved my daughter's
life I can never repay your kindness."

54
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:50,866
"Surely, the God himself came in your form
to give us this boon."

55
00:09:52,969 --> 00:09:55,631
" You gave her life...
You also name her, please."

56
00:09:56,606 --> 00:10:01,066
this baby face the danger of water...
I'll give her suitable name

57
00:10:01,845 --> 00:10:04,939
Gangotri... Gangotri...

58
00:10:56,967 --> 00:10:59,834
"For a two year old girl, they are celebrating
This festival in such a big way"

59
00:10:59,837 --> 00:11:02,599
This is nothing... see what is to come...
When she goes to school... a celebration

60
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,197
another to decorate her hair with flowers
yet another when she wears a half sari...

61
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:07,108
Like this we'll
have celebration after celebration...

62
00:11:08,445 --> 00:11:11,437
What are you waiting for? Pour them
on the baby's head and bless her!

63
00:11:12,415 --> 00:11:14,042
Please start the chanting.

64
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,228
"What is it, baby? Don't cry.
.aren't you my darling? Don't cry don't cry!"

65
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:29,398
"Oh, oh you shouldn't cry
Please baby don't cry"

66
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:33,598
"Here you take up!
Give her to. Please don't cry, baby"

67
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:35,931
You should smile... are you sweating?
Why why what happened?

68
00:11:36,106 --> 00:11:41,237
Don't cry don't cry.
What happened baby? Don't cry Don't cry.

69
00:11:41,311 --> 00:11:48,311
What happened? Why is she crying?
Ã” my baby dear darling baby don't cry

70
00:11:51,121 --> 00:11:53,851
"At what moment, from which direction
death may come, we don't know..."

71
00:11:55,191 --> 00:11:58,319
"Hey, run for the doctor!
Don't baby, don't my dear..."

72
00:11:58,895 --> 00:12:00,556
Don't cry my daughter.

73
00:12:17,714 --> 00:12:19,079
Who is this boy?

74
00:12:19,282 --> 00:12:21,250
He is my son, Simhadri, sir"

75
00:12:22,218 --> 00:12:27,349
Simhadri... a son befitting the father
. He made my crying daughter smile.

76
00:12:28,725 --> 00:12:32,388
"Like God created you for my sake,
He created your son for my child."

77
00:12:34,531 --> 00:12:38,092
"What from today keep him here.
I will provide food clothes, schooling..."

78
00:12:38,468 --> 00:12:40,561
everything myself. I will
even get him married.

79
00:12:46,643 --> 00:12:50,340
Neelakantham sir,
he is the only son we have...

80
00:12:51,915 --> 00:12:55,407
Then you do this. Bring him when
you come in the morning.

81
00:12:55,518 --> 00:12:58,686
" And take him back at night when you go.
From morning when she gets up till,"

82
00:12:58,754 --> 00:13:02,591
"she goes to sleep at night, he should
play and sing for her, take care of her."

83
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,024
"it will be as you please.
Let's see, ply the flute."

84
00:13:07,664 --> 00:13:09,063
He also sings well, sir."

85
00:13:09,299 --> 00:13:10,664
Then, sing a song."

86
00:13:11,167 --> 00:13:13,132
- Which song?
- Sing the song of the water bird.

87
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:31,045
Oh water bird, water bird, I call you gently"

88
00:13:32,551 --> 00:13:35,611
Little baby, little baby, I
don't need your company"

89
00:13:36,989 --> 00:13:39,514
if she smiles, what else is needed?"

90
00:13:41,226 --> 00:13:44,320
I should be by her when she sleeps

91
00:13:45,531 --> 00:13:49,592
This golden child is to be
guarded with delicate care.

92
00:13:50,769 --> 00:13:53,567
Oh water bird, water bird, I call you gently"

93
00:13:55,107 --> 00:13:58,338
"Little baby, little baby,
I don't need your company"

94
00:14:26,772 --> 00:14:30,264
"When she utters her cute words,
parakeets gaze..."

95
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:34,504
"As she takes her stumbling steps,
the deers gaze..."

96
00:14:36,014 --> 00:14:38,847
"As she smiles like the moonlight,
the moon gazes..."

97
00:14:40,419 --> 00:14:43,354
And as she grows like the waxing moon
remove the evil gaze

98
00:14:44,723 --> 00:14:47,123
"Gaze from here, gaze from there,
even mine and the Gods"'

99
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:55,229
You have to protect her from all evil gaze

100
00:14:56,135 --> 00:14:59,468
Oh water bird, water bird, I call you gently"

101
00:15:00,939 --> 00:15:03,999
"Little baby, little baby,
I don't need your company"

102
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:37,937
I'll be the doll in her little hands to play

103
00:15:39,311 --> 00:15:42,371
I'll be food to feed her if she's hungry

104
00:15:43,816 --> 00:15:46,785
In the cold morning, I'll be warm water"

105
00:15:47,986 --> 00:15:51,649
When she cries, I'll be her tears"

106
00:15:52,758 --> 00:15:54,055
I'll be her friend and teacher

107
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,485
I'll be her servant, I'll be her own"

108
00:15:59,364 --> 00:16:03,198
You should be witness to every word I say

109
00:16:04,136 --> 00:16:07,469
Oh water bird, water bird, I call you gently"

110
00:16:08,907 --> 00:16:12,206
"A Wonderful song,
Simhadri's song, it wants you to hear"

111
00:16:13,011 --> 00:16:15,070
His song is her lullaby

112
00:16:16,582 --> 00:16:20,678
if he's with her, it's a festival"

113
00:16:22,087 --> 00:16:25,614
Please bless that
our friendship will flourish

114
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:30,356
Oh water bird, water bird, I call you gently"

115
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:34,831
"A Wonderful song, Simhadri's song,
it wants you to hear"

116
00:16:52,384 --> 00:16:53,851
Good morning, sir."

117
00:16:53,985 --> 00:17:00,481
"Good morning. Now, In the last
Hindi exams, who got how many marks?"

118
00:17:01,693 --> 00:17:03,854
"I shall now say,
I will be saying... Simhadri?"

119
00:17:03,995 --> 00:17:05,360
Simhadri didn't come, sir."

120
00:17:05,463 --> 00:17:09,399
"Simhadri didn't come, sir? What's this?"

121
00:17:10,035 --> 00:17:13,493
"Simhadri fellow, doesn't attend... school regularly.
Yet he gets 80s and 90s.How?"

122
00:17:14,172 --> 00:17:15,800
Because, he doesn't listen
to your Hindi lesson ..."

123
00:17:15,873 --> 00:17:18,940
Because he doesn't listen to me?
There's no dearth of cheekiness.

124
00:17:19,044 --> 00:17:22,207
Sit down - not caring for your elders!
Gangotri?

125
00:17:46,705 --> 00:17:48,434
Gangotri... Stand up!

126
00:17:50,775 --> 00:17:55,906
"What these marks?
Out of Hundred, you get a big round ZERO?"

127
00:17:56,848 --> 00:18:00,617
"Sir, I am afraid of Hindi, sir.
I don't get it at all, sir.

128
00:18:00,618 --> 00:18:02,718
I'll write better next time sir."

129
00:18:02,787 --> 00:18:05,485
Even I am afraid of Hindi.But aren't we
learning specially at home?

130
00:18:05,523 --> 00:18:10,158
"Hey where is the cane? Get that cane here
Zero marks! Come here, come here"

131
00:18:11,262 --> 00:18:15,892
"I don't tolerate this. Come here, come on.
Zero out of hundred!"

132
00:18:16,067 --> 00:18:18,262
Come, hold out your hand! Hold it out."

133
00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:52,031
"Look here, sir! In any district, in any
village, in any school, the teacher"

134
00:18:52,237 --> 00:18:56,071
" has the right to punish the kid if the
kid is in the wrong. But in our village,"

135
00:18:57,308 --> 00:19:00,607
" in our school, when Gangotri is in the
wrong, if she gets less marks,"

136
00:19:01,112 --> 00:19:03,307
then she can not be punished -
but me.

137
00:19:03,915 --> 00:19:08,215
What? You think you're hero?
You'll take the blows for Gangotri?

138
00:19:11,055 --> 00:19:16,550
Okay. You hold your hand out. Out with it.

139
00:19:30,675 --> 00:19:31,573
Go, Go sit down."

140
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:43,448
"Why kids, Why are you closing
eyes when I punish them?"

141
00:19:44,522 --> 00:19:47,252
"You only told, not to see evil!
Sit..."

142
00:19:51,229 --> 00:19:55,723
Doing harm to someone who helps you
how you say it in Hindi? Tell?

143
00:19:55,867 --> 00:19:57,562
"Can I say in Telugu, sir?
Okay, whatever."

144
00:19:58,269 --> 00:20:02,968
it is like you hitting us with the same cane
that we bring to you.

145
00:20:04,209 --> 00:20:10,114
Silence... Silence... Silence... Who's laughing?
Why laughing? All of you

146
00:20:10,215 --> 00:20:12,215
Stand up on the bench. Stand up on
the bench. Come on stand up.

147
00:20:17,355 --> 00:20:19,653
Did you see how many blows Simhadri
bore for the sake of Gangotri?

148
00:20:19,891 --> 00:20:22,382
"Oh, not just blows, he'll even give up
his life for her."

149
00:20:23,828 --> 00:20:25,728
"From childhood,
Gangotri has been Simhadri's life."

150
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:40,570
What...
Is it burning?

151
00:20:41,813 --> 00:20:43,346
"I put my hand in water, didn't I?
Now it's cool."

152
00:20:43,414 --> 00:20:46,178
Unnecessarily, you got beaten for my sake."

153
00:20:46,284 --> 00:20:48,377
I didn't even feel a thing - it's for you.

154
00:20:49,187 --> 00:20:52,020
"While I'm there, if you could get beaten
like that, do you think I'll stay quiet?"

155
00:20:52,757 --> 00:20:54,217
I won't tolerate if even
your parents beat you.

156
00:21:16,781 --> 00:21:19,315
"Suseela Madam, Neelakantham Naidu sir
commanded us to bring Narasimham urgently."

157
00:21:19,884 --> 00:21:20,612
Wait a minute.

158
00:21:30,028 --> 00:21:32,020
"It seems Neelakantham Naidu sir
is calling you. Okay, I'll go."

159
00:21:52,784 --> 00:21:55,562
One minute. Today is our
wedding anniversary.

160
00:21:55,563 --> 00:21:58,279
I wanted to visit the temple along with you.

161
00:21:59,657 --> 00:22:00,646
If you can return quickly...

162
00:22:03,261 --> 00:22:10,133
"If guy goes to work, he'll know when he'll return.
I always go to give my life."

163
00:22:18,076 --> 00:22:21,045
"Between Vizag and Bhuvaneswar
to build a rail track,"

164
00:22:22,313 --> 00:22:25,043
sealed tenders are invited before 12
noon today by the Divisional Engineer

165
00:22:39,364 --> 00:22:41,798
"Greetings Neelakantham sir, welcome...
Welcome... sit down."

166
00:22:43,334 --> 00:22:45,393
please sit down in this chair.

167
00:22:48,706 --> 00:22:49,798
Many people came for tenders

168
00:22:51,476 --> 00:22:56,072
Who dares to put in a tender against
our Neelakantam Naidu?

169
00:22:57,215 --> 00:22:59,384
We came just in case you didn't want to...
sir. Or else

170
00:23:00,053 --> 00:23:02,254
"who dares to put a tender
against you ...Not only

171
00:23:03,155 --> 00:23:05,181
in this district... But
in this whole state, sir."

172
00:23:06,791 --> 00:23:07,723
Engineer...
Sir

173
00:23:08,059 --> 00:23:09,321
Confirm the tender

174
00:23:09,761 --> 00:23:12,457
"There must be at least
two tenders to confirm, sir ..."

175
00:23:13,297 --> 00:23:15,697
I'll give you a second one also...
In my sister's name

176
00:23:16,067 --> 00:23:20,561
"Okay, sir.
Stop!"

177
00:23:36,287 --> 00:23:38,252
There's still ten minutes time
to file a tender.

178
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:42,751
"It'll be the end of you, Bapineedu...
Don't mess with this Neelakantham Naidu"

179
00:23:44,328 --> 00:23:48,424
Eh... There's no chance of this Bapineedu
getting scared. You don't need me...

180
00:23:48,633 --> 00:23:54,094
To compete with you. This brother of my
concubine is enough. Hey brother-in-law! Go on!

181
00:24:02,814 --> 00:24:03,906
Stop!

182
00:24:05,049 --> 00:24:07,449
"If you take one more step,
that will be your last!"

183
00:24:08,453 --> 00:24:10,944
"if you step back, your head
will roll forward... Go on"

184
00:24:33,478 --> 00:24:37,175
"Accept both my tenders.
Okay, sir"

185
00:24:37,248 --> 00:24:41,150
You better wash your face before going home.
Else your wife will have a heart failure!

186
00:24:45,156 --> 00:24:47,656
Dear Suseela! May you live for full hundred
years with your husband and prosper.

187
00:24:50,161 --> 00:24:53,252
You are teaching music and dance to our children.
By teaching these things to

188
00:24:53,296 --> 00:24:56,526
"poor people, You're helping them earn
some money. We'll always be in your debt."

189
00:24:58,169 --> 00:25:00,569
"Madam, Madam... Your husband,
for the sake of Neelakantham Naidu,"

190
00:25:00,671 --> 00:25:02,263
...has cut off Bapineedu's
brother-in-law's leg!

191
00:25:06,544 --> 00:25:08,905
"Oh God! So that my husband will keep
us in his mind, think about his son"

192
00:25:22,226 --> 00:25:24,217
please bless us so.

193
00:25:59,197 --> 00:26:00,289
Everything ready?
Ready!

194
00:26:00,998 --> 00:26:03,057
Do all of you have coins?
Yes!

195
00:26:03,901 --> 00:26:06,062
Okay. Put all your coins on the tracks.
Yes

196
00:26:11,142 --> 00:26:13,642
"The train is coming. Move on, clear out...
Ah, move on, clear out..."

197
00:26:30,928 --> 00:26:33,556
Eeeeey!
That's my coin... thatâ€™s my coin.

198
00:26:37,935 --> 00:26:40,403
"Hey, my coin...
Hey, that's my coin."

199
00:26:41,272 --> 00:26:42,803
"What, this fellow...
Hey, that coin is mine."

200
00:26:43,541 --> 00:26:49,946
"Let go. Come on, let go.
Simhadri... Listen to me Simhadri..."

201
00:26:53,951 --> 00:26:57,443
"Hey stop. Simhadri, don't... Simhadri,
listen to me... Simhadri ..."

202
00:27:00,091 --> 00:27:02,090
"Better give my coin back... Or else...
Simhadri, don't ..."

203
00:27:13,804 --> 00:27:16,398
"Hey Ganga, stop.
Gngaa... Gangaa"

204
00:27:22,546 --> 00:27:24,741
"Simhadri... As it is, her aunt is
ill tempered. What she'll do?"

205
00:27:26,284 --> 00:27:27,808
Teacher... Teacher...
Teacher... Teacher

206
00:27:27,985 --> 00:27:29,976
What' is it?
Simhadri hit Gangotri with a stone.

207
00:27:30,988 --> 00:27:32,580
Really? Where is Gangotri now?

208
00:27:33,157 --> 00:27:34,249
She went home crying.

209
00:27:39,263 --> 00:27:41,663
"Hey, Ganga stop.
Gangaa"

210
00:27:43,634 --> 00:27:45,497
"Hey, looks like someone hit
Neelakantham sir's daughter!"

211
00:27:45,803 --> 00:27:47,600
"Then, there's going to be a
dead body in the village."

212
00:27:48,606 --> 00:27:52,007
"You scumbag, how dare you to
pluck mangoes from our orchard?"

213
00:27:52,176 --> 00:27:53,074
No, I didn't pluck them"

214
00:27:53,644 --> 00:27:56,277
Then you lie on top of that? Why did
you do this? I'll smear chilli powder

215
00:27:56,448 --> 00:27:58,137
...in your eyes if I have to make you
tell the truth.

216
00:27:58,215 --> 00:27:59,907
"No, Ma'am. I am not like that.
You useless fellow!"

217
00:27:59,917 --> 00:28:00,941
Oh mother, it burns..."

218
00:28:03,554 --> 00:28:07,149
I can twist out your intestines...
What do you think about Durgamma?

219
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:13,694
Oh my... Oh my... What...
What happened? Oh... Oh... So much blood.

220
00:28:14,198 --> 00:28:17,065
"Oh brother, look here! Come quick,
Oh, Oh! Come see!"

221
00:28:21,072 --> 00:28:22,835
"See, who hit her...
See how much blood is spilling ..."

222
00:28:22,974 --> 00:28:26,910
Gangotri, what happened?
Who hit you, tell me."

223
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:30,940
Who hit you? Who hit you, Tell me"

224
00:28:31,615 --> 00:28:32,809
Who hit you? Tell me, tell me."

225
00:28:33,117 --> 00:28:36,382
Narasimha! The fellow who drew the blood
of my darling girl can not remain alive.

226
00:28:40,391 --> 00:28:44,191
"Tell me, baby. I'll get that fellow's
hands chopped off. Tell me who it is."

227
00:28:44,362 --> 00:28:45,989
Whoever it is, tell."

228
00:28:51,569 --> 00:28:54,197
Hmmm, as I was walking back from school ..."

229
00:28:54,271 --> 00:28:55,135
Who hit you?

230
00:28:57,675 --> 00:29:01,076
No one hit me. I stumbled against
the school gate and fell.

231
00:29:07,118 --> 00:29:09,086
You don't have to worry a bit.
I'll apply this ointment.

232
00:29:09,754 --> 00:29:10,743
Quickly. Do it quick.

233
00:29:15,693 --> 00:29:17,456
Sister look about that gate

234
00:29:17,928 --> 00:29:22,388
"I'll look after this, brother,
why worry? Hey Dasu?"

235
00:30:00,938 --> 00:30:06,774
What life is this... I have to open the gate
...I have to clean the rooms

236
00:30:07,978 --> 00:30:11,345
I have to ring the bell... it's better to
die than live this Hindi teacher's life.

237
00:30:15,052 --> 00:30:17,885
"Oh my, What's this? Neelakantham sir's
Sumos are rushing here?"

238
00:30:24,762 --> 00:30:28,425
Oh, Why, you're removing the gate?"

239
00:30:28,899 --> 00:30:32,460
"Because this gate tripped her, our
Gangotri fell down. So we trash it."

240
00:30:34,505 --> 00:30:36,166
In case she fell down in the school...

241
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,567
"With a single bomb, I'll decimate
the school. Go on"

242
00:30:40,177 --> 00:30:41,201
What terrible thing this is!

243
00:30:41,245 --> 00:30:42,212
You'll trash the school?

244
00:30:42,279 --> 00:30:44,042
"Good morning master. What happened
to the gate, Master?"

245
00:30:44,515 --> 00:30:50,249
"it got what's coming to it, dear. Look dear,
I implore upon you,"

246
00:30:50,421 --> 00:30:52,748
"if you ever fall in the school,
please don't tell your father so, okay?"

247
00:30:52,749 --> 00:30:56,583
Okay Master. I'll tell him that I've fallen
at your home as I go for tuition.

248
00:30:58,462 --> 00:30:59,690
Master, Master, do you know this!"

249
00:30:59,763 --> 00:31:00,821
What dear?

250
00:31:01,098 --> 00:31:03,328
"For Gangotri, her father
arranged a special train from our village"

251
00:31:04,335 --> 00:31:05,393
He'll arrange the train...

252
00:31:06,203 --> 00:31:08,793
And he'll arrange for bombs if the train
doesn't run. When does this train start?

253
00:31:09,006 --> 00:31:10,030
"Tomorrow, master.
Tomorrow?"

254
00:31:14,044 --> 00:31:14,806
"Simhadri?
Ah, coming."

255
00:31:16,447 --> 00:31:21,248
Neelakantham sir is like god! Even a goods
train doesn't stop in this station/

256
00:31:21,352 --> 00:31:22,912
In such case, he brought
this express train ..."

257
00:31:22,986 --> 00:31:26,716
"Hey Obules, you don't understand.
Listen, I'll explain it to you very plainly."

258
00:31:27,424 --> 00:31:31,053
"This train stops here not for you,
nor for your wife, nor for my children."

259
00:31:31,195 --> 00:31:34,187
"Now, you know our Neelakantham sir's
daughter, Gangotri, right!"

260
00:31:35,333 --> 00:31:37,830
"She must be taken to Gangotri every year,
right! To do that, one has to go to"

261
00:31:37,835 --> 00:31:39,700
"either Vijayawada or Hyderabad which
is difficult, right!"

262
00:31:40,838 --> 00:31:43,172
"So, he directly went to Delhi, put a knife
to the railway minister's neck"

263
00:31:43,207 --> 00:31:45,168
...and got this express train here.
That's why it's here.

264
00:31:45,509 --> 00:31:46,635
Hey Teacher.

265
00:31:46,844 --> 00:31:49,574
"Yes, sir. So, like that, our Neelakantham
Naidu sir, for our village ..."

266
00:31:50,681 --> 00:31:52,239
"Stop your praise... Proceed.?/Okay, sir"

267
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,439
"Guard sir, guard, sir. When will this
train come back to our village?"

268
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,164
What, dear?"

269
00:31:55,686 --> 00:31:58,416
"Passing seven states, it reaches Gangotri
and comes back after seven days."

270
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:01,576
"This is a station, this is a stop...
Your questions...

271
00:32:01,577 --> 00:32:02,682
My answers... All this my fate!"

272
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:04,454
Hey kids, all come here."

273
00:32:06,931 --> 00:32:07,863
We all have to do one thing.

274
00:32:07,998 --> 00:32:09,022
What shall we do?

275
00:32:09,733 --> 00:32:12,702
You all write down the names of people you
love on a paper and stick it to this train.

276
00:32:14,038 --> 00:32:16,101
"When the train returns whose
paper will remain intact,

277
00:32:16,102 --> 00:32:17,906
only that person's love is true."

278
00:32:18,075 --> 00:32:19,064
Okay.
Okay.

279
00:32:20,277 --> 00:32:27,277
"Ready? Come on.
Hey, Hey... I can't see it ..."

280
00:33:00,647 --> 00:33:02,137
Gangotri...

281
00:33:04,617 --> 00:33:07,484
"Choo Train choo choo train,
with a song in its whistle"

282
00:33:08,822 --> 00:33:09,686
All the notes of music...

283
00:33:14,194 --> 00:33:17,459
"Choo train choo choo train,
with a dance in its gait"

284
00:33:17,998 --> 00:33:19,329
All the steps of dance

285
00:33:19,599 --> 00:33:21,157
Lively music it plays...

286
00:33:24,337 --> 00:33:26,669
Wiping out the distance between
people... This train

287
00:33:35,515 --> 00:33:36,504
Gangotri...

288
00:33:40,954 --> 00:33:42,353

Curry rice... Mutton rice...

293
00:33:51,231 --> 00:33:53,665
It offers you coconut water in Kerala

294
00:33:55,168 --> 00:33:57,398
it lets you taste Bisibela bath of Karnataka

295
00:34:02,542 --> 00:34:05,705
"From Andhra pesarat -
upma, wrapped in parcel"

296
00:34:06,513 --> 00:34:09,448
Roti in Maharashtra for lunch at noon

297
00:34:14,487 --> 00:34:17,581
"Showing Agra palace, giving Simla apple"

298
00:34:20,894 --> 00:34:23,025
"Stepping through Haridvar,
truing through Rushikesh"

299
00:34:23,096 --> 00:34:25,690
To Gangotri it hurries on...

300
00:34:33,706 --> 00:34:36,834
Gangotri...

301
00:35:00,767 --> 00:35:03,668
"When it's hot in the Sun, it shades us"

302
00:35:04,571 --> 00:35:07,506
"In rain, it holds under its umbrella"

303
00:35:13,446 --> 00:35:15,346
"All night, it's awake, sacrificing sleep"

304
00:35:16,449 --> 00:35:19,782
"Like mother, it rocks us to sleep."

305
00:35:24,124 --> 00:35:27,287
Denying itself a holiday...
Bringing us friends...

306
00:35:27,794 --> 00:35:31,025
"Bearing all our burdens,
taking us to our destinations"

307
00:35:31,764 --> 00:35:34,289
it rejects all shades of caste and religion

308
00:35:35,768 --> 00:35:39,295
it brings all humans on the same track

309
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:49,143
Gangotri...

It's mine... it's mine...

00:36:22,945 --> 00:36:24,673
Shh, stop. Let's see whose paper it is ..."

316
00:36:37,526 --> 00:36:41,087
"How come, all the papers we wrote are gone.
Only yours is remaining."

317
00:36:41,363 --> 00:36:47,359
"For pure thought, pure sound and for
sacred deed, the five elements will help."

318
00:36:47,469 --> 00:36:48,868
My mother said.

319
00:36:49,271 --> 00:36:55,506
I love India... I love India...
I love India...

320
00:40:46,475 --> 00:40:49,570
To give up life for the sake of those
who feed us... That's our family motto.

321
00:40:49,978 --> 00:40:51,809
Well done... Now you are my son!

322
00:40:52,748 --> 00:40:57,447
What? Is this what you should be
teaching him? You should tell him

323
00:40:59,021 --> 00:41:01,851
"to study well, bringing good name
to his parents and to his country."

324
00:41:02,557 --> 00:41:08,325
" In stead, do you want him to become
a slave to that house, like yourself?"

325
00:41:09,398 --> 00:41:16,031
Suseela! Do you forget the help Neelakantham
sir extended when we got married

326
00:41:17,939 --> 00:41:21,636
Like the squirrel helping Lord Rama
you too should help that family

327
00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:22,802
...and repay your debt.

328
00:41:24,246 --> 00:41:25,941
First, will you do me a favor?"

329
00:41:26,615 --> 00:41:28,776
What?
Please lift your head.

330
00:41:33,955 --> 00:41:36,048
What's this, like the bell
in the neck of Nandi?"

331
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:42,597
"Like Nandi is the trusted
servant of Lord Siva,"

332
00:41:42,698 --> 00:41:44,832
"you too are such trusted
servant to your lord, right?"

333
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:46,192
True.

334
00:41:48,003 --> 00:41:51,769
"When you lift your arm to kill some one
on his behalf, this bell will ring."

335
00:41:53,742 --> 00:41:56,575
Thus it will remind you that you
have a wife and son.

336
00:41:57,846 --> 00:42:01,509
That you should live for the sake of
your loved ones...

337
00:42:23,238 --> 00:42:24,899
"Greatings, sir
ls the cash ready?"

338
00:42:25,974 --> 00:42:29,409
"100 million is too big an amount, sir, so it
has to be brought from the head office"

339
00:42:30,145 --> 00:42:33,578
"by the manager at 1 o'clock. I'll bring it
myself and deliver it at your home, sir."

340
00:42:33,648 --> 00:42:37,575
What the heck you deliver? You took six
months to prepare the check after

341
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:41,845
the track work was complete. Now to cash it
you saying 1 o'clock. Think this a game?

342
00:42:41,890 --> 00:42:43,414
Please forgive this once, sir ..."

343
00:42:43,625 --> 00:42:47,959
Okay. Even one minute past 1 o'clock...
Your family will be orphans - take care.

344
00:42:48,130 --> 00:42:49,859
"Yes, sir.
Yes, sir"

345
00:42:52,033 --> 00:42:55,464
Today is my sister's birthday. Wherever
I may go if I don't return to her on this day

346
00:42:56,371 --> 00:43:01,104
"she won't even touch her food. So, I'll go.
Large amount. Be careful."

347
00:43:01,910 --> 00:43:03,935
"Sir, you going alone ..."

348
00:43:04,913 --> 00:43:10,351
"Not me, no one can touch even my shadow.
You be careful."

349
00:43:24,966 --> 00:43:29,596
Bapineedu! How long I've been trying for you
Our plan success. I told him

350
00:43:29,938 --> 00:43:33,098
there's no cash in the bank and delayed
payment He left alone for his sister's

351
00:43:34,276 --> 00:43:37,444
"birthday, that Neelakantham. There's no
better chance than this. Get him ..."

352
00:43:37,478 --> 00:43:43,340
He won't enjoy his sister's birthday treats
I'll make his sister eat his death feast.

353
00:43:44,085 --> 00:43:45,109
Best of luck

354
00:44:05,707 --> 00:44:08,198
"Hey you, what's this conspiracy against
our Neelakantham sir? Tell me, tell."

355
00:44:10,579 --> 00:44:12,547
Don't kill me... Don't kill...
I'll tell I'll tell.

356
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:35,997
"Hello... Suseelaa!
What, why are you in such hurry?

357
00:44:36,037 --> 00:44:37,629
There's a danger to Neelakantham sir's life.

358
00:44:39,441 --> 00:44:43,571
"Out side our village, at the 3rd milestone
Bapineedu's people plan to kill him."

359
00:44:44,579 --> 00:44:46,809
You must get to him before he
gets there and warn him.

360
00:44:48,683 --> 00:44:51,412
You may not like him too much
but won't you do this one help to me?

361
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:54,011
I'm too far away.

362
00:44:55,223 --> 00:44:59,091
Suseela! I didn't ask you for anything
since we got married. For the first time...

363
00:44:59,227 --> 00:45:01,060
I'm asking you. Please go and save his life.

364
00:45:02,697 --> 00:45:06,463
Please Suseela! I'll salute you.
Go and save his life.

365
00:45:07,836 --> 00:45:09,030
Okay. I will go.

366
00:45:09,704 --> 00:45:11,035
Where is the teacher going?

367
00:45:15,043 --> 00:45:17,004
"Mom...
Teacher! Teacher! Teacher, please stop."

368
00:45:20,315 --> 00:45:21,247
Mom! Stop.

369
00:46:00,622 --> 00:46:04,718
Neelakantham sir! Don't come. Stop there!
Stop there

370
00:46:06,027 --> 00:46:08,086
Why's Suseela running this way?
Driver go quick.

371
00:46:08,196 --> 00:46:11,688
"Neelakantham sir! Don't come this way.
No, don't come. Stop right there!"

372
00:46:13,268 --> 00:46:16,101
Neelakantham sir! Don't come this way

373
00:46:16,404 --> 00:46:20,284
"Stop right there. No, don't come.
No, don't come.

374
00:46:20,285 --> 00:46:23,404
Neelakantham sir! Don't... Don't come."

375
00:46:25,614 --> 00:46:27,504
"Neelakantham sir,
they're looking to kill you."

376
00:46:59,648 --> 00:47:02,640
"Calm down Simhadri, don't be sad."

377
00:47:07,155 --> 00:47:10,147
My mother said one shouldn't be
depressed when faced with troubles

378
00:47:10,191 --> 00:47:11,453
one should be strong

379
00:47:13,428 --> 00:47:17,888
All my strength is my mother. Now
that she's not here...

380
00:47:24,906 --> 00:47:27,033
"Narasimham, to save my husband's life"

381
00:47:29,177 --> 00:47:31,338
this boy lost his mother...

382
00:47:33,281 --> 00:47:36,512
"Though he lost his mother, I'm there for him.
But if we had lost your husband"

383
00:47:36,685 --> 00:47:38,710
all of us would have been orphans!

384
00:47:44,192 --> 00:47:46,752
"But, one thing bothers me ..."

385
00:47:47,562 --> 00:47:48,927
What is it?

386
00:47:49,197 --> 00:47:52,689
She got away from me the chance
of saving your life.

387
00:47:54,369 --> 00:47:56,963
"Had I got that opportunity,
my life would have been fulfilled."

388
00:48:06,314 --> 00:48:07,246
"Come, let's go. Move."

389
00:48:08,216 --> 00:48:09,740
I'll come later.

390
00:48:09,884 --> 00:48:12,918
You shouldn't stay long in the
house of death. That's misfortune... Come...

391
00:48:24,232 --> 00:48:29,363
"What, the kids are going out instead
of coming in!"

392
00:48:29,571 --> 00:48:31,261
Per chance the headmaster is dead or what?

393
00:48:31,573 --> 00:48:32,733
"Yes, he's gone."

394
00:48:32,874 --> 00:48:35,570
"Where, ma'am?
Not to heaven, home."

395
00:48:35,744 --> 00:48:38,235
"Why, ma'am?
Look there"

396
00:48:42,083 --> 00:48:45,382
"Fifteen days Gangotri holidays. Oh,
just like Sankranthi holidays and"

397
00:48:45,487 --> 00:48:47,282
"Christmas holidays, now there are
Gangotri holidays too."

398
00:48:47,288 --> 00:48:49,620
"No, I granted them."

399
00:48:51,092 --> 00:48:53,356
"This year, our Ganga should not miss
any classes for her X class. So,"

400
00:48:54,562 --> 00:48:57,498
" till we return from
Gangotri if you try to run

401
00:48:57,499 --> 00:49:00,194
classes, you'll be gone... Straight up ..."

402
00:49:01,269 --> 00:49:05,035
"No, ma'am! Why drag me in? Not worth it.
I'll die even if hit with a piece of chalk"

403
00:49:05,273 --> 00:49:06,297
Go on.

404
00:49:09,043 --> 00:49:12,274
What wonder... This Neelakantham
who doesn't know anything but stabbing

405
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:15,447
" and killing - how much he loves his daughter!
Till they return from Gangotri oh my,"

406
00:49:16,785 --> 00:49:20,881
"oh my, the school shouldn't be open!"

407
00:49:32,167 --> 00:49:33,764
"Hey, Gangotri is here. Gangotri is here."

408
00:49:33,802 --> 00:49:35,494
"No, Gangotri didn't come here.
We came to Gangotri."

409
00:49:36,638 --> 00:49:38,333
"Here, there are three
Gangotris did you know?"

410
00:49:38,334 --> 00:49:39,758
"Here, take care of those pots and stuff..."

411
00:49:39,759 --> 00:49:41,390
"You're one Gangotri,
this train's one Gangotri ..."

412
00:49:41,476 --> 00:49:42,602
This place is another Gangotri...

413
00:49:42,811 --> 00:49:44,711
This kind of joking is what irritates me.

414
00:49:44,979 --> 00:49:47,072
Where's that lame fellow
that always greets us?

415
00:49:48,316 --> 00:49:51,285
"I arrived, ma'am... I'm here... I'm here..."

416
00:49:52,420 --> 00:49:54,479
"Hey, are you well?"

417
00:49:56,424 --> 00:50:00,383
"I'm well, ma'am. From the money you
gave last time, I bought these boots, ma'am."

418
00:50:00,628 --> 00:50:01,686
"They're nice, ma'am."

419
00:50:02,664 --> 00:50:05,360
"Hey, 'cause asked you, you want to
kick me with your booted foot or what?"

420
00:50:05,533 --> 00:50:06,795
Even a lame fellow like you...

421
00:50:06,901 --> 00:50:09,565
He bought those boots with the money you
gave last time. He's asking if you like them.

422
00:50:12,807 --> 00:50:16,573
"Hey, stop your nonsense. Hey lame! Did
you make arrangements for the full bath?"

423
00:50:17,278 --> 00:50:19,371
"Super ready, sir.
Then moov"

424
00:50:43,346 --> 00:50:48,045
"With turmeric and vermillion,
with milk and perfume"

425
00:50:48,251 --> 00:50:51,015
pure sandal paste and
divine nectars themselves

426
00:50:51,354 --> 00:50:52,746
"washing every limb, removing every curse"

427
00:50:54,657 --> 00:51:01,657
This sacred bath offered to Gangotri

428
00:51:06,035 --> 00:51:08,799
"Oh, mother Ganga"

429
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:14,508
"Tell river Krishna, not to cause troubles"

430
00:51:17,179 --> 00:51:21,582
"Tell river Yamuna, to always bring help"

431
00:51:24,053 --> 00:51:27,045
"To Godavari and Kaveri,
to brook and stream"

432
00:51:28,291 --> 00:51:33,593
the falling rain and the diving water fall
to all your siblings...

433
00:51:38,034 --> 00:51:44,303
"Please tell, Oh Mother Ganga ..."

434
00:51:47,276 --> 00:51:49,938
Live river you are... Granter of salvation...

435
00:51:51,380 --> 00:51:53,277
"The queen of prosperity, fruits,
flowers and decorations"

436
00:52:00,823 --> 00:52:03,018
Siva's dreadlocks your dance steps

437
00:52:04,927 --> 00:52:06,519
you give good fortune to the women bathers

438
00:52:14,570 --> 00:52:18,904
to wipe off dangers and sins
in this sacred river three dips enough

439
00:52:19,342 --> 00:52:26,342
"water blessing from you
Oh mother, Ganga Bhavani"

440
00:52:29,452 --> 00:52:31,113
In her solid protection...
The girl will blossom full

441
00:52:46,969 --> 00:52:50,302
Oh flowing Gangotri... Daughter of snow
mountain Daughter of Hari

442
00:52:53,642 --> 00:53:00,642
Stream of life... Oh pure one...

443
00:53:26,475 --> 00:53:29,376
"Father Father...
Hey Gangotri, what's it dear?"

444
00:53:29,945 --> 00:53:32,106
What's he carving?

445
00:53:34,950 --> 00:53:39,910
"Not sure, dear. All there years we were
coming here, never noticed this. Hey Satya!"

446
00:53:39,988 --> 00:53:43,082
Yes sir.
Find out what's that.

447
00:53:45,194 --> 00:53:47,628
That stone... What name...
Carve you do?

448
00:53:48,931 --> 00:53:51,052
"If you know, talk in English...
Or in Hindi...

449
00:53:51,053 --> 00:53:52,833
If not that, speak in your mother tongue"

450
00:53:54,536 --> 00:53:56,934
" Telugu. Don't talk this piece meal
tongue, murdering all three languages."

451
00:53:57,005 --> 00:53:59,496
"Oh great, you know telugu?"

452
00:53:59,708 --> 00:54:01,972
We live at pilgrim centers - can speak
many languages.

453
00:54:03,345 --> 00:54:05,242
"Okay, so why are you carving these
names on these stones?"

454
00:54:05,247 --> 00:54:09,274
This place is called the spot of rebirth.
Those whose names are carved here

455
00:54:10,319 --> 00:54:14,779
they'll preserve the nods of this life
in the next life also - that's the belief.

456
00:54:16,491 --> 00:54:18,652
Great. What land is this! Bring paper.

457
00:54:19,494 --> 00:54:21,826
Oh sculptor! What do you charge
for each name?

458
00:54:22,130 --> 00:54:23,290
"Hundred rupees, ma'am."

459
00:54:23,365 --> 00:54:29,235
"Not hundred. Take a thousand.
But carve my name, my sister's name"

460
00:54:29,538 --> 00:54:32,029
and my daughter's name - these three
names there.

461
00:54:32,107 --> 00:54:33,096
"Yes, sir."

462
00:54:33,408 --> 00:54:36,566
"Not this life, not next life, for many lives
to come, I should be born as a"

463
00:54:36,645 --> 00:54:39,603
"brother to my sister and and to this
golden father, this bundle of gems"

464
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:43,715
should be born as my daughter.
Carve them...

465
00:54:44,586 --> 00:54:45,553
"Okay, move on... Move on."

466
00:54:46,321 --> 00:54:48,312
"Hey Simhadri, you stay on and
get our names carved."

467
00:54:48,313 --> 00:54:49,537
Okay.
We'll go have some tiff in. Come

468
00:54:49,558 --> 00:54:50,616
Then Simhadri's tiff in...

469
00:54:51,226 --> 00:54:53,786
"That's where I get irritated. He'll eat
some stuff here, move. Come on."

470
00:54:54,997 --> 00:54:55,964
You're always like this.

471
00:54:58,734 --> 00:54:59,632
"Uncle, uncle...
What, man?"

472
00:54:59,868 --> 00:55:01,335
I brought some Telugu people

473
00:55:01,470 --> 00:55:03,961
"Great, lame fellow. All these days I thought
there's no Telugu hotel"

474
00:55:04,072 --> 00:55:05,505
"...here in Gangotri.
So then, whose is it?"

475
00:55:05,574 --> 00:55:08,236
it's mine sir. My name is Anjaneya Sastry.
Our village is Draksharamam.

476
00:55:08,310 --> 00:55:10,005
"Then, it's next to our place ..."

477
00:55:10,078 --> 00:55:12,246
"In lndia, in all pilgrim centers there
are many Telugu hotels, sir."

478
00:55:13,315 --> 00:55:15,650
"But here in Gangotri, the Mother Ganga
granted me the fortune of running"

479
00:55:15,651 --> 00:55:18,413
" the hotel here. Come, please come in and sit.
Hey Mumtaj, our Telugu guests are here."

480
00:55:18,486 --> 00:55:21,717
"Okay alright. That's good. Sister, get every
one well fed.I'll get the cars ready."

481
00:55:21,823 --> 00:55:22,847
"Okay you go on.
Come, Come."

482
00:55:26,428 --> 00:55:28,953
"Hey, bring a glass of water for the madam."

483
00:55:30,232 --> 00:55:34,430
You are making fun of me because I'm fat?

484
00:55:34,536 --> 00:55:36,094
Did I get fat eating your
father's food or what?

485
00:55:36,137 --> 00:55:39,539
"No, she's not making fun, ma'am.
She means to bring some water."

486
00:55:39,608 --> 00:55:40,897
She's a muslim. Doesn't know Telugu well.

487
00:55:40,942 --> 00:55:43,611
What nonsense! You employ a muslim
girl in a Telugu hotel?

488
00:55:43,712 --> 00:55:46,112
"Not an employee, ma'am.
Mumtaj is my wife."

489
00:55:46,214 --> 00:55:51,709
Ah! You're a brahmin and you married
a muslim girl? That's what irritates me.

490
00:55:51,787 --> 00:55:54,551
"What's wrong in that, ma'am? Didn't Lord
Venkateswara marry Bibi Nanchari?"

491
00:55:54,723 --> 00:55:58,784
Oh Lord Srinivasa! Okay okay.
My stomach is growling. Bring tiff in.

492
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:00,621
Tell me what you'd like

493
00:56:00,762 --> 00:56:02,662
Bring idli and vada for every one
and onion dosa for me.

494
00:56:03,799 --> 00:56:05,790
"Hey mumtaj, put some onion on the dosa!"

495
00:56:05,867 --> 00:56:08,131
"Oh Lord, what? You want her to
piss on my dosa?, dirty fellow!"

496
00:56:08,737 --> 00:56:10,602
"No, no ma'am.
What I said in Urdu is onion."

497
00:56:12,307 --> 00:56:15,902
"Oh, even I know that."

498
00:56:23,752 --> 00:56:25,515
Why you eat vada first? Eat the idli.

499
00:56:29,257 --> 00:56:30,815
"Oh, you already finished the idli?"

500
00:56:37,065 --> 00:56:38,532
"Ah, you ate the vada too?"

501
00:56:40,168 --> 00:56:42,068
"What hunger is this, eating like a
demon's sister!"

502
00:56:44,973 --> 00:56:46,600
"What, oh my! What did I say now?"

503
00:56:56,651 --> 00:56:58,812
"Did you see sir, how well he carved?"

504
00:57:01,189 --> 00:57:07,560
"Gangotri, Durgamma, Neelakantham, Tulasi..."

505
00:57:09,164 --> 00:57:13,396
"Hey, I ordered only three names...
How my wife's name ..."

506
00:57:14,035 --> 00:57:17,698
"I only told, sir. Perhaps you forgot
your wife's name in the hurry then"

507
00:57:21,977 --> 00:57:25,936
"Though I forgot the bonds of marriage, the
gratitude you have for her reminded you"

508
00:57:27,716 --> 00:57:34,716
Great Simhadri
Gangotri... Durga...

509
00:57:37,259 --> 00:57:42,390
"You sculptor useless fellow. That middle
letter in my name is crooked, why?"

510
00:57:42,731 --> 00:57:46,258
"Pardon me, ma'am. As I was carving
your name, my chisel shook."

511
00:57:46,902 --> 00:57:51,737
Even her name shook the chisel.
Her loud mouth shakes our entire village!

512
00:57:57,913 --> 00:58:01,474
"Oh it will shake. I'll shake it. You bloody
...Come. You come along now, come on."

513
00:58:03,251 --> 00:58:04,912
I'll get a photo...
Okay then

514
00:58:05,086 --> 00:58:06,246
You go on. I'll be there.
Okay

515
00:58:09,090 --> 00:58:09,749
What dear?

516
00:58:10,392 --> 00:58:13,919
"If you carve friends' names here, then
will they be friends in next life also?"

517
00:58:13,962 --> 00:58:15,429
"Most definitely, dear."

518
00:58:16,097 --> 00:58:17,792
"Then please carve our names also.
Here, take this."

519
00:58:18,366 --> 00:58:20,493
"What's this, she paid with her
golden bangle!"

520
00:58:30,278 --> 00:58:32,542
What happened Ganga?

521
00:58:34,049 --> 00:58:35,949
"Well, well, I don't know Hindi well, no?"

522
00:58:36,351 --> 00:58:39,650
"Then, did that Hindi teacher beat you?
I will ..."

523
00:58:40,288 --> 00:58:43,917
"Today is the Hindi test.
Even if I write, I'll fail."

524
00:58:44,092 --> 00:58:46,890
"So, you won't go to the test and keep
crying here instead? What if you fail..."

525
00:58:47,028 --> 00:58:49,223
you can pass next year.

526
00:58:49,664 --> 00:58:53,259
You'll all pass and go on to the next class
I have to stay on in the same class.

527
00:58:53,401 --> 00:58:57,599
"Oh, that's the scene. Okay.
You'll get 100 out of 100 in Hindi. Okay?"

528
00:58:58,807 --> 00:59:01,332
Here' I'm crying that I'll fail. You make
fun of me that I'll get 100 out of 100?

529
00:59:01,443 --> 00:59:04,571
"Not making fun. Truly, if you do as I say,
you'll get 100 out of 100."

530
00:59:05,313 --> 00:59:06,746
What to do?

531
00:59:06,815 --> 00:59:09,375
"First, remove your clothes.
Cha, I'm shy"

532
00:59:10,285 --> 00:59:12,378
"Okay, I'm even more shy. Come here."

533
00:59:17,826 --> 00:59:19,794
What you looking at. Bring the wig.

534
00:59:22,364 --> 00:59:26,232
"Though I look like a comedian, I'm very
serious at work. Any one caught..."

535
00:59:27,469 --> 00:59:29,115
"cheating will be debarred, and I'll get all

536
00:59:29,116 --> 00:59:31,436
of you dismissed. All girls,
check your skirts and blouses.

537
00:59:31,506 --> 00:59:34,633
All boys check not only your shirts
and pants, but underwear also..."

538
01:00:11,079 --> 01:00:13,513
Go on.
Cute girl like a guava fruit

539
01:00:15,684 --> 01:00:19,415
eyes like pieces of chalk.
Nose like a pencil

540
01:00:20,956 --> 01:00:22,787
lips like erasers

541
01:00:25,193 --> 01:00:27,127
"Oh gosh, I'm lucky, ain't I?"

542
01:00:27,896 --> 01:00:29,887
No luck!

543
01:00:31,433 --> 01:00:34,027
"Do you know this? Like Venkatesh
in Sundarakanda movie,"

544
01:00:34,169 --> 01:00:36,467
it's written in my horoscope
that I too will marry a student.

545
01:00:37,706 --> 01:00:40,072
I too was told by fortuneteller that
I'll elope with my teacher.

546
01:00:40,909 --> 01:00:41,933
Really?
Yours lovingly!

547
01:00:43,912 --> 01:00:47,905
"Here, it's time for the test. I'll give
you full cooperation. All the best."

548
01:01:09,704 --> 01:01:11,672
Ah! I'll give you punishment for coming
late to the exam.

549
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:13,432
"No, I didn't come to take the exam,
you fool!"

550
01:01:13,508 --> 01:01:14,907
Then?

551
01:01:15,610 --> 01:01:17,056
The daughter of the
warlord of our village is

552
01:01:17,057 --> 01:01:18,439
writing the exam here. She's poor in Hindi.

553
01:01:18,446 --> 01:01:20,141
"If she fails in the test,
I who taught her ..."

554
01:01:20,815 --> 01:01:22,840
I who's the invigilator and
the school hosting the exam...

555
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:27,911
All these he'll blow up with a single
bomb. I salute you.You just close your eyes.

556
01:01:30,125 --> 01:01:32,116
And turn away - I'll take these notes and
pass them to her.

557
01:01:32,260 --> 01:01:33,386
Who is the girl?

558
01:01:33,862 --> 01:01:36,422
There... She's sitting there... Eleven
zero one. That girl.

559
01:01:36,498 --> 01:01:37,988
Yeah? Then give it here.

560
01:01:42,303 --> 01:01:48,435
Dear Gangotri! Ganotri! I know why you
are suffering.

561
01:01:49,978 --> 01:01:51,969
Here, I brought you the notes. Copy from it."

562
01:01:52,013 --> 01:01:56,177
"Listen to me, dear. if you fail, your father
will close my file. Gangotri, oh dear!"

563
01:01:59,988 --> 01:02:02,320
Look here. I'm leaving the notes here.
Copy from it and get 100 out of 100.

564
01:02:04,092 --> 01:02:06,083
"My golden girl, my dearest... Please
say yes. Listen to me."

565
01:02:06,995 --> 01:02:09,623
Guava fruit!

566
01:02:11,166 --> 01:02:14,829
Guava fruit! Guava fruit!

567
01:02:14,903 --> 01:02:19,636
"Poor girl, may be she's hungry, so she
brought a fruit. Okay dear, eat your fruit."

568
01:02:21,609 --> 01:02:26,444
"Copy from the notes, dear. Oh my dear...
What's this the kick from there..."

569
01:02:26,681 --> 01:02:29,172
...split me up here?

570
01:02:33,688 --> 01:02:36,156
This girl's blows are more powerful
than even her dad's!

571
01:02:37,058 --> 01:02:38,889
Go on to the doctor.

572
01:02:43,932 --> 01:02:46,029
"Why did you kick him like that, not
considering he's your teacher?"

573
01:02:46,067 --> 01:02:47,898
"if another man touches me, should
I bear it or what?"

574
01:02:48,136 --> 01:02:49,899
"So, can I touch?"

575
01:02:52,107 --> 01:02:56,840
"Sure, but not here. After the exam, if you
come to the orchard, then you can touch"

576
01:02:56,978 --> 01:02:57,876
wherever you want.

577
01:02:57,979 --> 01:02:59,077
"Then I'll come prepared, okay?"

578
01:03:04,719 --> 01:03:08,621
Sit down... Sit down... Silence...

579
01:03:10,358 --> 01:03:13,987
That's how I tricked the invigilator and
wrote the exam to come here.

580
01:03:14,062 --> 01:03:15,859
"In a little while he'll come,
see, our super lover."

581
01:03:15,964 --> 01:03:17,090
Here he comes.

582
01:03:27,242 --> 01:03:29,069
"Hai... Till now, she's been talking about
you only, sir."

583
01:03:29,110 --> 01:03:30,077
"Thank you, young boy."

584
01:03:30,111 --> 01:03:33,137
"On seeing you, even in first glance she
lost her heart, offered up her youth"

585
01:03:33,281 --> 01:03:35,749
"she even lost her guava fruit, apparently."

586
01:03:37,552 --> 01:03:40,578
"Guava fruit? Whatever. I'm ready to
give up my life even for Ganga... Here, Gangi"

587
01:03:41,723 --> 01:03:44,590
"Who are your elders, What's your village,
What's your father's name?"

588
01:03:44,692 --> 01:03:45,716
Won't you tell?

589
01:03:45,794 --> 01:03:47,284
"Why, you want to fix the wedding?"

590
01:04:01,075 --> 01:04:08,075
"My uncle's from Mogaltur,
dad's place is Palakol"

591
01:04:10,752 --> 01:04:16,816
"My uncle's from Mogaltur,
dad's place is Palakol"

592
01:04:17,725 --> 01:04:20,159
That I've come of age to marry

593
01:04:21,663 --> 01:04:23,756
They won't let me go among men.

594
01:04:26,100 --> 01:04:28,091
My uncle... My dad...

595
01:04:28,369 --> 01:04:34,501
"My uncle's from Mogaltur,
dad's place is Palakol"

596
01:04:39,180 --> 01:04:40,374
"Oh girl, I'll satisfy you"

597
01:04:42,116 --> 01:04:44,676
I'll get your elders to agree

598
01:04:46,020 --> 01:04:48,011
"Oh thin waisted lovely,
if you agree to marry"

599
01:04:49,791 --> 01:04:51,952
"From Pithapuram, I'll get the palanwuin"

600
01:05:27,795 --> 01:05:30,889
"I'm your teacher, you're my student"

601
01:05:32,233 --> 01:05:33,962
"This match is made in heaven, oh girl"

602
01:05:34,002 --> 01:05:36,937
"Our story is Sundarakanda, oh girl"

603
01:05:38,706 --> 01:05:39,866
Even if I don't listen in class

604
01:05:40,842 --> 01:05:42,173
though I don't come to tuition

605
01:05:43,144 --> 01:05:44,502
"Please don't hit me with the cane, oh sir"

606
01:05:44,779 --> 01:05:47,748
"Even if you beat, beat me softly sir."

607
01:05:48,916 --> 01:05:50,178
I won't make you stand on bench

608
01:05:50,418 --> 01:05:52,409
I won't punish you even

609
01:05:53,354 --> 01:05:55,117
"Come sit in my lap, oh girl"

610
01:05:55,189 --> 01:05:58,090
"I'll give you hundred marks, oh girl."

611
01:05:59,494 --> 01:06:04,397
"Oh master, Oh master, why these
twisted thoughts you have"

612
01:06:07,201 --> 01:06:10,170
"if the elders get to know, your box
will be thrown out"

613
01:06:13,574 --> 01:06:20,207
Uncle's from Mogaltur...

614
01:06:20,548 --> 01:06:23,142
"Your dad's place is Palakol, I know"

615
01:07:02,924 --> 01:07:05,256
Marriage with a girl like me

616
01:07:05,360 --> 01:07:07,590
"if you wish for, then
you'll be the bride, sir"

617
01:07:09,263 --> 01:07:11,697
"I'll be your husband, sir."

01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,059
This incredible beauty coming to my side

619
01:07:16,604 --> 01:07:18,629
"I'm okay with anything, oh girl."

620
01:07:20,241 --> 01:07:22,038
"if 'this' becomes 'that',
that's okay oh girl"

621
01:07:23,745 --> 01:07:25,872
if you set up house with a girl like me

622
01:07:27,281 --> 01:07:29,010
"the story gets reversed, sir."

623
01:07:30,518 --> 01:07:32,008
"You'll become pregnant, sir."

624
01:07:33,988 --> 01:07:39,483
"Oh master, Oh master,
student is not your pair."

625
01:07:40,995 --> 01:07:45,955
"if uncle gets to know,
he'll play rough with you."

626
01:07:48,102 --> 01:07:55,102
"My uncle's from Mogaltur,
dad's place is Palakol"

627
01:08:18,045 --> 01:08:19,637
"Hey, the results have come"

628
01:08:19,714 --> 01:08:21,079
Yes?
You passed in first class.

629
01:08:22,950 --> 01:08:24,247
You got 90 marks in Hindi.
Really?

630
01:08:24,852 --> 01:08:26,752
"We all passed, but only Simhadri failed."

631
01:08:42,336 --> 01:08:43,769
Gangotri what happened... Gangotri...

632
01:08:54,648 --> 01:09:01,451
"Tulasi... Sister... Sister... Sister...
What happened? Sister,"

633
01:09:02,723 --> 01:09:04,987
"What happened? What happened
to my golden child, tell me!"

634
01:09:05,026 --> 01:09:06,823
"That
What happened, tell me."

635
01:09:06,927 --> 01:09:07,951
That... That...

636
01:09:08,095 --> 01:09:09,919
"What happened? What happened
to my golden child, tell me!"

637
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:10,646
Ask your wife.

638
01:09:10,698 --> 01:09:12,325
"Ah, why do you laugh?
Tell me, what happened?"

639
01:09:13,434 --> 01:09:16,494
The girl got her first period.

640
01:09:27,181 --> 01:09:28,705
"Simhadri, how come you're still here?"

641
01:09:29,717 --> 01:09:30,843
"Why, what happened?"

642
01:09:31,185 --> 01:09:33,685
"Gangotri had fainted in her house, I heard.
Really?"

643
01:09:53,941 --> 01:09:56,239
"Hey, That Simhadri idiot is coming.
Close the gates"

644
01:10:02,850 --> 01:10:07,878
"Hey, open the gates. I have to see Gangotri
urgently. What happened to Gangothri?"

645
01:10:08,923 --> 01:10:13,792
"From this day on, you can't see her.
Can't come here for Gangotri."

646
01:10:15,729 --> 01:10:18,129
Even Gangotri's name should not
come your mouth.

647
01:10:18,165 --> 01:10:20,998
Why?
Gangotri came of age.

648
01:10:29,810 --> 01:10:33,337
"Tulasi, All the ladies have arrived.
Go bring Gangotri."

649
01:10:35,683 --> 01:10:37,446
What Gangotri is not ready yet?

650
01:10:37,551 --> 01:10:39,746
"Without Simhadri, she says she
doesn't want this celebration."

651
01:10:40,955 --> 01:10:43,016
"Unless Simhadri comes and sings,
she won't come out, it seems."

652
01:10:43,090 --> 01:10:46,057
"Why, how come Simhadri didn't
come yet? Hey, where is Simhadri?"

653
01:10:47,461 --> 01:10:49,452
I only told him not to come. Why's he
needed at this function?

654
01:10:49,530 --> 01:10:54,467
"Cha Cha, stop sister. Since she's a baby,
he looked after her. Till yesterday..."

655
01:10:55,769 --> 01:10:59,102
"they roamed together. Why prohibit him?
Look here, to make Gangotri happy"

656
01:10:59,173 --> 01:11:01,403
"whatever she wants
must be done, that's all"

657
01:11:01,475 --> 01:11:04,967
"Hey, who's there. Go get Simhadri."

658
01:11:05,045 --> 01:11:06,444
"Alright, sir
You go bring Ganga!"

659
01:11:27,765 --> 01:11:32,168
"In a garden on a plant,
a flower blossomed."

660
01:11:38,542 --> 01:11:43,502
"Like a queen, like a goddess it smiled"

661
01:11:48,519 --> 01:11:52,455
it should smile on forever

662
01:11:56,727 --> 01:11:59,525
it should smile on forever

663
01:11:59,597 --> 01:12:01,827
"The sky, and earth, The brook and stream"

664
01:12:02,566 --> 01:12:06,798
Trees and birds will bless her

665
01:12:13,044 --> 01:12:17,606
"In a garden on a plant,
a flower blossomed."

666
01:12:19,083 --> 01:12:22,519
"Like a queen, like a goddess it smiled"

667
01:12:45,242 --> 01:12:50,305
"Many colored flower, not seen sunlight"

668
01:12:51,916 --> 01:12:55,750
"Beautiful flower, full of many virtues"

669
01:12:57,722 --> 01:13:03,319
"Which temple it will adorn,
the God shall bless her"

670
01:13:06,731 --> 01:13:13,731
"The flower will worship,
in God's own temple"

671
01:13:18,242 --> 01:13:21,473
That flower will be happy

672
01:13:28,285 --> 01:13:32,346
"In a garden on a plant,
a flower blossomed."

673
01:14:02,887 --> 01:14:07,324
"Giving it water, shading it like a shelter"

674
01:14:08,659 --> 01:14:13,062
"In rain and shine,
the gardener adores her"

675
01:14:14,331 --> 01:14:21,331
"Won't he accompany her always,
There's no other God"

676
01:14:24,008 --> 01:14:28,342
The gardner is God himself for the flower

677
01:14:30,347 --> 01:14:37,347
The bond of flower and the gardener
won't ever weaken

678
01:14:40,057 --> 01:14:44,323
"In a garden on a plant,
a flower blossomed."

679
01:14:44,995 --> 01:14:49,591
"Like a queen, like a goddess it smiled"

680
01:14:49,667 --> 01:14:52,761
it should smile on forever

681
01:14:53,571 --> 01:14:55,698
The sky, and earth, The brook and stream"

682
01:14:55,806 --> 01:15:00,505
Trees and birds will bless her

683
01:15:07,573 --> 01:15:11,202
"Hey you, the water is heating for the bath.
First, pour some water into this tank."

684
01:15:11,243 --> 01:15:12,301
Okay ma'am.

685
01:15:12,545 --> 01:15:14,945
In this god forsaken house no one
cares about anything.

686
01:15:15,047 --> 01:15:16,309
Only I have to take care of everything.

687
01:15:17,616 --> 01:15:18,913
Lata, How is Simhadri?"

688
01:15:20,052 --> 01:15:21,349
Why, that's why I came."

689
01:15:22,688 --> 01:15:26,715
"Hey you, see if that stove is burning
or not. Oh my Oh my, throwing..."

690
01:15:26,826 --> 01:15:29,351
"dirt in my eyes, how did you get in
like bandicoots? Just now, I went inside..."

691
01:15:29,462 --> 01:15:33,057
"for a minute. What, did you bring some
message from that Simhadri fellow?"

692
01:15:33,132 --> 01:15:34,622
No ma'am.To give this book to Gangotri...

693
01:15:34,700 --> 01:15:38,636
"No books to be given. Look here
once the girl attains puberty, all this..."

694
01:15:38,704 --> 01:15:42,606
running around and games can't go on.
She will not go to school any more.

695
01:15:45,744 --> 01:15:48,907
"If she wants to study so much, the teacher
will come home and teach. Okay?"

696
01:15:50,249 --> 01:15:53,241
"In the name of studies or books, if you
or that Simhadri fellow turn up here"

697
01:15:56,021 --> 01:16:00,754
"You see that stove, I'll break your limbs
and stuff them into that stove. Go on."

698
01:16:00,926 --> 01:16:03,417
Go die, curse your mothers' wombs ..."

699
01:16:24,750 --> 01:16:27,844
"I feel like seeing you, won't you come
to my house immediately?"

700
01:16:28,787 --> 01:16:29,811
Now?

701
01:16:30,256 --> 01:16:33,521
I need to talk many things with you.
They won't send me to school any more.

702
01:16:35,361 --> 01:16:38,330
I heard. All are asleep.
Come over immediately.

703
01:16:39,465 --> 01:16:41,626
This late at night...

704
01:16:43,068 --> 01:16:44,160
Okay.

705
01:17:10,429 --> 01:17:16,129
"Simhadri, I'm very sad. it's been
a full week since I saw you."

706
01:17:17,469 --> 01:17:21,667
"That we shouldn't meet any more, your
elders ordered - so my father also said."

707
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:23,569
That's the tradition apparently.

708
01:17:24,476 --> 01:17:29,675
"What tradition, I don't know. They won't
let me sit out of the house. if I don't"

709
01:17:29,815 --> 01:17:35,685
"see you, I'll cry. Simhadri, I can't be
without seeing you."

710
01:17:35,788 --> 01:17:42,788
"I can't stay too, Ganga. But I have to...
Let's do this. Keep this flute with you."

711
01:17:48,734 --> 01:17:51,498
"When you see this, you'll recall
my songs and words,"

712
01:17:51,604 --> 01:17:53,037
it'll feel like seeing me.

713
01:17:53,672 --> 01:17:57,039
I don't want the feeling. You should
come see me now and then.

714
01:17:58,477 --> 01:18:01,344
"Okay, I'll come visit you when no one can
watch, like this. I'll make a move, Ganga."

715
01:18:02,781 --> 01:18:08,583
"One minute. There's dew falling, Simhadri.
In this cold, how will you go that far?"

716
01:18:08,654 --> 01:18:14,786
Take this sweater and wear it.

717
01:18:21,900 --> 01:18:23,595
Hey, who is that?"

718
01:18:26,405 --> 01:18:29,636
Hey Malli, Hey Malli.
Where the hell are you?"

719
01:18:32,244 --> 01:18:33,541
There's some sound there. Go check it.

720
01:18:33,846 --> 01:18:36,346
"Hey who's there?
Hey Ranga, you go check that!"

721
01:18:50,129 --> 01:18:54,930
"Hey, hey, hey, brother, did you see?
Did you see that? He's eloping"

722
01:18:57,836 --> 01:18:59,486
"with our girl. My gosh,
Coming into the house

723
01:18:59,487 --> 01:19:01,101
like a thief at night
to meet a grownup girl"

724
01:19:04,343 --> 01:19:05,810
"No, sir, What happened was...
- What not?"

725
01:19:13,285 --> 01:19:16,948
"In front of our very eyes, you were holding her hand.
Who are you trying to fool?"

726
01:19:17,122 --> 01:19:20,785
"Though my sister warned me, I let you
into the house."

727
01:19:20,859 --> 01:19:22,622
Is this what you pay back with?

728
01:19:29,268 --> 01:19:30,792
Go. Go inside.
Move girl! Move on!

729
01:19:33,472 --> 01:19:34,769
Take her in. Fellows, break him apart."

730
01:19:46,151 --> 01:19:53,151
"Father... Don't beat Simhadri, father
Father... Father... Don't beat"

731
01:19:55,327 --> 01:19:58,091
Narasimham... Narasimham... That
Neelakantham's people are beating your...

732
01:20:07,406 --> 01:20:09,169
It is not Simhadri's fault, father.
Listen to me."

733
01:20:10,909 --> 01:20:13,002
"What nonsense are you talking.
Come, go inside"

734
01:20:35,801 --> 01:20:40,966
"Brother, please stop. Little fellow
perhaps committed mistake not knowing well."

735
01:20:41,039 --> 01:20:42,802
if it's his fault, please forgive him."

736
01:20:42,908 --> 01:20:46,071
"What, forgive him? In front of my very
eyes, he's dragging my daughter along ..."

737
01:20:49,681 --> 01:20:51,974
"Father... Don't beat Simhadri, father
Father... Father ...Don't beat"

738
01:20:56,355 --> 01:20:57,788
What are you looking at?

739
01:20:59,892 --> 01:21:06,892
If one hand hurts my son...

740
01:21:18,677 --> 01:21:22,579
"Alas, alas, all is over. it's all over.
Our prestige is drowned in the Ganges."

741
01:21:23,949 --> 01:21:26,474
That Simhadri fellow visits your daughter
at midnight.

742
01:21:27,920 --> 01:21:32,118
"His dad raises his hand against you,
threatening to kill. You can't stay quiet."

743
01:21:32,324 --> 01:21:34,155
We should see the end of this father and son.

744
01:21:36,757 --> 01:21:37,485
What are you saying?

745
01:21:38,792 --> 01:21:40,123
Yes, sir. I saw it with my own eyes."

746
01:21:41,028 --> 01:21:44,725
"What good news you brought! So,
Neelakantham and Narasimham fall apart."

747
01:21:44,865 --> 01:21:47,095
Very good.

748
01:22:21,335 --> 01:22:22,461
Yes dad.

749
01:22:23,337 --> 01:22:24,668
Will you ever go to that house?

750
01:22:26,340 --> 01:22:27,432
No dad!

751
01:22:31,312 --> 01:22:32,836
Even if you feel like seeing Gangotri?

752
01:22:36,517 --> 01:22:37,643
I won't go, dad."

753
01:22:39,186 --> 01:22:43,714
He forgot all the service you rendered
and kicked you in your chest.

754
01:22:43,791 --> 01:22:50,791
"How can I forget that, dad? I won't go dad.
Never will I go there, dad."

755
01:22:58,739 --> 01:23:05,739
"Calm down, boy. My heart aches
in sadness. Will you ..."

756
01:23:11,885 --> 01:23:15,548
"I'll do anything for you, dad. Anywhere
you want me to go, I'll go."

757
01:23:37,778 --> 01:23:44,778
I feel you were hasty in dealing with
Narasimham.

758
01:23:46,420 --> 01:23:48,547
He even lost his wife
in the effort to save your life.

759
01:23:52,593 --> 01:23:53,582
True.

760
01:23:56,230 --> 01:23:58,562
Yes sir.
Bring that Narasimham along... Carefully.

761
01:23:58,632 --> 01:23:59,599
Go. Go inside
Okay sir.

762
01:23:59,667 --> 01:24:02,602
Go. Go inside.
What's this?

763
01:24:05,039 --> 01:24:07,769
That you won't ever see in your life...
You can't even imagine...

764
01:24:08,308 --> 01:24:09,570
Why did you bring?

765
01:24:11,278 --> 01:24:16,614
Not to induce you to join my gang or to
join hands with me. For twenty five years...

766
01:24:16,750 --> 01:24:21,619
You protected his life with yours.
What are you left with?

767
01:24:21,789 --> 01:24:25,691
By dawn that Neelakantham will be history.

768
01:24:37,571 --> 01:24:40,699
"Sir, that Narasimham joined with Bapineedu, sir.
They're planning to kill you."

769
01:24:43,077 --> 01:24:47,446
Then He and that Bapineedu should be ashes
along with that music school.

770
01:24:49,083 --> 01:24:53,543
You shouldn't interfere.This is the payment.
Tell me if that's not enough.

771
01:24:53,687 --> 01:24:55,086
I'll send more.

772
01:24:55,856 --> 01:24:58,848
"Bapineedu! Like every human has only
one father and only one mother,"

773
01:24:58,992 --> 01:25:01,620
there's only one person you can trust.
That trust is vested in only one person.

774
01:25:01,795 --> 01:25:08,795
He may have lost his trust in me. But
my faith in him will remain with me

775
01:25:10,537 --> 01:25:13,301
till my last breath.

776
01:25:15,509 --> 01:25:18,103
This is the center of art which my wife
regarded as sacred temple itself.

777
01:25:19,413 --> 01:25:23,543
"So, I'll let you off. if
this happened elsewhere,"

778
01:25:23,684 --> 01:25:25,914
I'd have cut up all off you into little pieces.
Get out of here.

779
01:26:26,079 --> 01:26:27,410
Oh what horrible tragedy!

780
01:26:27,681 --> 01:26:29,615
This is doing evil against your benefactor.

781
01:26:30,884 --> 01:26:34,650
That poor teacher lost her life to protect
Neelakantham's life.

782
01:26:35,756 --> 01:26:37,518
"At last, that Neelakantham took
even Narasimham's life."

783
01:26:37,991 --> 01:26:40,687
Even Simhadri was looking after
Neelakantham's daughter like his own life.

784
01:26:42,062 --> 01:26:48,729
Yes, true. This whole family
served that one faithfully"

785
01:26:48,936 --> 01:26:51,370
"yet they made this boy an orphan
Poor fellow, how will he survive?"

786
01:27:31,411 --> 01:27:38,411
Hey Neelakantham Naidu!

787
01:28:39,513 --> 01:28:45,349
"Hey, who's that? Who dares to call my
brother by his name, in this whole district?"

788
01:28:45,452 --> 01:28:46,783
it's me.

789
01:28:48,388 --> 01:28:50,879
"Oh my, you wretched Simhadri!
Since your father died, did you get drunk"

790
01:28:51,091 --> 01:28:52,524
to shoot your mouth off?

791
01:28:52,693 --> 01:28:56,959
"Yes! Since my childhood, Neelakantham
Naidu was God. His word was the law."

792
01:28:57,097 --> 01:29:02,228
His house is the temple... The tipsiness
of my father's teachings is now gone

793
01:29:02,502 --> 01:29:04,902
Hey, what' your problem?"

794
01:29:05,906 --> 01:29:09,364
"Hey, it's to stop your daughter's crying
you asked me to sing."

795
01:29:10,877 --> 01:29:15,041
" it was you who asked me to play with her,
to look after her like my very life."

796
01:29:17,084 --> 01:29:19,484
At last, you succumb to the evil
words of your sister,"

797
01:29:21,021 --> 01:29:22,802
"and put a dirty color
on our friendship, and

798
01:29:22,803 --> 01:29:24,582
separate us, that also you!
And your sister!"

799
01:29:24,725 --> 01:29:26,386
What, you're talking too much."

800
01:29:27,694 --> 01:29:29,286
I'm not crazy, I speak the whole truth."

801
01:29:31,431 --> 01:29:36,130
"Hey, I raised Gangotri with these hands.
We never had these dirty thoughts."

802
01:29:37,604 --> 01:29:40,767
it is you and your sister that planted
this thought in us now...

803
01:29:44,111 --> 01:29:47,945
Alright. From this moment on...
This moment on... I love Gangotri.

804
01:29:50,250 --> 01:29:51,979
I love you, Gangotri!"

805
01:30:00,927 --> 01:30:06,957
"365 days! In three hundred and sixty
five days, I'll take Gangotri away from you."

806
01:30:07,334 --> 01:30:09,632
Hey, who's there? Cut this fellow up!"

807
01:30:10,637 --> 01:30:14,801
"Hey, what are you? Your fellows will
cut me up? You can't even touch my hair!"

808
01:30:22,315 --> 01:30:26,445
Brother! Alas, alas, blood!"

809
01:33:06,713 --> 01:33:10,080
"In three hundred and sixty five days,
I'll take Gangotri away from you."

810
01:33:16,556 --> 01:33:20,390
Stop there. Bring the news of that wretched
Simhadri's death or bring his corpse.

811
01:33:21,695 --> 01:33:24,960
"Until then, none of you can enter my house.
Go... Go..."

812
01:33:25,031 --> 01:33:30,697
Come back only with Simhadri's corpse.

813
01:34:11,378 --> 01:34:17,715
"Did you return with the good news of Simhadri's death?
Ah, tell me. Did you find him?"

814
01:34:19,819 --> 01:34:22,148
"We searched Guntur, Krishna, all coastal
districts. Also searched every"

815
01:34:24,824 --> 01:34:30,888
lane in Hyderabad. Rayalaseema also
we searched. No trace of him anywhere...

816
01:34:32,065 --> 01:34:39,065
You must find... And cut him up. Announce
in TV and the papers. Not only in our state

817
01:34:40,907 --> 01:34:44,240
Search every inch of the whole country.

818
01:34:59,125 --> 01:35:06,125
"Oh Lord, My simhadri shouldn't face any danger.
Protect him safely wherever he is"

819
01:36:11,331 --> 01:36:12,992
Sir, look here a minute."

820
01:36:15,335 --> 01:36:16,597
Yes, what's it?"

821
01:36:17,237 --> 01:36:18,626
Who asked you to carve these names here?

822
01:36:18,671 --> 01:36:21,167
"That girl who came with you all, all her
dear friends' names she wanted carved"

823
01:36:21,474 --> 01:36:25,774
"here, so that you'll all remain her friends
in the next life too."

824
01:37:24,401 --> 01:37:28,303
if you and I stay together, I am pleased."

825
01:37:34,177 --> 01:37:37,874
if you and I become we, I'm even happy"

826
01:37:43,920 --> 01:37:48,357
That you love me, and I
love you, that I found"

827
01:37:49,626 --> 01:37:56,626
You are there and I'm here

828
01:37:58,468 --> 01:38:02,427
You are there and I'm here
this is too tough.

829
01:38:07,777 --> 01:38:11,372
If you and I stay together, I am pleased."

830
01:38:12,615 --> 01:38:16,312
if you and I become we, I'm even happy"

831
01:38:17,120 --> 01:38:24,120
That you love me, and I
love you, that I found"

832
01:38:26,729 --> 01:38:30,961
You are there and I'm here

833
01:38:32,469 --> 01:38:35,927
You are there and I'm here
this is too tough.

834
01:38:59,762 --> 01:39:03,892
The kites we flew once reach hearts' depth

835
01:39:05,301 --> 01:39:08,828
The fruits we tasted together
now bring our tastes together

836
01:39:08,938 --> 01:39:13,307
The banks of the river bends we roamed
put these twists in the story

837
01:39:14,544 --> 01:39:18,275
"The sand homes we built, now build
us our own home"

838
01:39:19,582 --> 01:39:23,678
"That dear one who raised me tenderly,
now that he'll own me fully"

839
01:39:28,124 --> 01:39:30,991
You are there and I'm here

840
01:39:33,363 --> 01:39:36,924
You are there and I'm here -
this is too tough.

841
01:39:38,668 --> 01:39:41,796
If you and I stay together, I am pleased."

842
01:39:43,339 --> 01:39:46,775
if you and I become we, I'm even happy"

843
01:40:16,439 --> 01:40:20,739
That the lessons in the school teaches to love

844
01:40:22,045 --> 01:40:25,742
That the train tracks set up our
wedding procession

845
01:40:25,848 --> 01:40:30,410
That our names set in stone show up
as wedding invitations

846
01:40:31,754 --> 01:40:35,383
The marriage of dolls we performed
now bless us

847
01:40:35,858 --> 01:40:38,622
"Those steps I taught her, now become
the sacred seven steps."

848
01:40:39,996 --> 01:40:42,430
You are there and I'm here

849
01:40:45,134 --> 01:40:52,134
You are there and I'm here
this is too tough.

850
01:40:55,245 --> 01:40:58,806
If you and I stay together, I am pleased."

851
01:40:59,949 --> 01:41:03,407
if you and I become we, I'm even happy"

852
01:41:04,921 --> 01:41:08,049
That you love me, and I
love you, that I found"

01:41:09,592 --> 01:41:13,619
You are there and I'm here

854
01:41:13,763 --> 01:41:20,763
You are there and I'm here
this is too tough.

855
01:41:56,888 --> 01:41:58,048
Oh, what a house!"

856
01:42:02,226 --> 01:42:03,853
"You don't go ahead, stop there.
You back, man"

857
01:42:03,995 --> 01:42:06,896
Come on, fellows, come, come"

858
01:42:08,132 --> 01:42:09,360
What's this commotion?

859
01:42:09,433 --> 01:42:12,061
"Wait sir, I'll tell you. You wait. Stop.
Yes, put them down, ladies,"

860
01:42:12,203 --> 01:42:13,500
keep the plates there.

861
01:42:18,242 --> 01:42:19,641
Who are you?

862
01:42:19,744 --> 01:42:21,575
"If you know who we are, you won't be
sitting like that!"

863
01:42:21,646 --> 01:42:22,578
You'll be standing!

864
01:42:23,414 --> 01:42:24,676
What are all these?

865
01:42:24,949 --> 01:42:27,017
"Sweets, pure ghee sweets, brought from
Nirmala Swagruha foods."

866
01:42:27,084 --> 01:42:29,416
"Even in America or in Andhra, these are in
great demand"

867
01:42:29,520 --> 01:42:31,010
"Why all these?
To eat, sir."

868
01:42:32,223 --> 01:42:34,919
"Either in America, or in Andhra, these
are utilized for eating."

869
01:42:34,992 --> 01:42:36,420
Hey, teacher, who is this man? Who are they?"

870
01:42:36,661 --> 01:42:39,596
"Oh, nothing, sir. This is Mr. Sunil, works
in ZP school in our town."

871
01:42:39,664 --> 01:42:41,231
Our Gangotri took the Hindi exam
in their school.

872
01:42:41,432 --> 01:42:45,493
I'm the reason for Gangotri writing that exam
well and passing.

873
01:42:46,103 --> 01:42:50,767
"Oh, thank you very much. Then as she
passed, Gangotri should bring you sweets."

874
01:42:51,042 --> 01:42:52,600
Why did you bring?

875
01:42:52,777 --> 01:42:54,677
"Sir, no such formalities between
Gangotri and myself."

876
01:42:55,813 --> 01:42:59,544
Many thanks. What do you wish from me?
Should I get you the best teacher award?

877
01:43:00,618 --> 01:43:03,043
"Either in America or in Andhra,
awards come by themselves if one has cash."

878
01:43:03,053 --> 01:43:07,716
Then... Ah... You want promotion as
the head master?

879
01:43:08,260 --> 01:43:10,288
"Ah, what promotion. if bribes are given,
it'll come by itself."

880
01:43:10,294 --> 01:43:11,955
Then, tell me how much you want."

881
01:43:12,029 --> 01:43:13,963
"Oh, what's the deal with money.
After the wedding..."

882
01:43:14,031 --> 01:43:15,555
the whole wealth will be mine anyway

883
01:43:15,633 --> 01:43:16,759
Then, tell me what you want."

884
01:43:16,901 --> 01:43:17,999
Oh my gosh, I'm suddenly shy sir."

885
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,591
"Hey, Either in America or in Andhra, it's
the girls who should feel shy, why you?"

886
01:43:20,638 --> 01:43:21,798
You shut up

887
01:43:22,974 --> 01:43:26,307
"Bridegroom, isn't he? He'll be shy.
Nothing, sir. This young fellow loves"

888
01:43:28,145 --> 01:43:30,834
your Gangotri. Gangotri too loves him.
These two loved each other...

889
01:43:30,847 --> 01:43:33,916
...roaming around the fields and lake shores
and among the wells.

890
01:43:34,885 --> 01:43:36,077
So, now if we exchange these promises"

891
01:43:36,554 --> 01:43:38,456
"That's all sir, they
give us this plate and we

892
01:43:38,457 --> 01:43:40,318
give that plate in return,
talk about that..."

893
01:43:41,525 --> 01:43:43,618
"What's this, sir? We come for wedding
and you pour water on us!"

894
01:43:44,662 --> 01:43:50,623
"Hey, you want to marry my daughter, eh?
Make this fellow unfit for marriage!"

895
01:43:55,273 --> 01:44:00,506
Oh my god! I don't know any thing. These
fellows are dangerous.

896
01:44:01,846 --> 01:44:03,279
I am just a Hindi teacher.

897
01:44:05,182 --> 01:44:08,015
"Either in America or in Andhra,
I don't think this is the way."

898
01:44:08,085 --> 01:44:10,076
But here, this is the way."

899
01:44:12,923 --> 01:44:13,947
So, you want our little queen?"

900
01:44:15,359 --> 01:44:18,192
"Hey, hey, hey, if he comes out, he'll
kill you. Go on, run away!"

901
01:44:19,063 --> 01:44:21,194
"You can remove my body from here, but
who can drag my heart away."

902
01:44:21,265 --> 01:44:22,289
Then let's do this.

903
01:44:22,433 --> 01:44:23,991
Let's leave his heart here and take
his body away

904
01:44:24,135 --> 01:44:25,159
Where can we carry his body?

905
01:44:26,037 --> 01:44:28,335
"How can we lift his weight? You all come
come, eh! Come come come..."

906
01:44:28,606 --> 01:44:31,006
Gangotri! My heart is here. Pick it up!

907
01:44:36,847 --> 01:44:38,347
Brother, what do you want?"

908
01:44:42,353 --> 01:44:44,116
"Ma'am, how much is ldli?
You're Telugu boy?"

909
01:44:44,388 --> 01:44:46,356
Yes ma'am Plate idli seven rupees

910
01:44:47,058 --> 01:44:49,583
How much is poori?
Poori is eight rupees

911
01:44:53,064 --> 01:44:54,554
Ah... Upma?
Upma is seven rupees.

912
01:44:58,469 --> 01:45:00,130
Single tea - how much? Tea is three rupees

913
01:45:02,073 --> 01:45:05,099
"Then I'll have a single tea.
Hey, bring a single tea."

914
01:45:13,918 --> 01:45:18,287
What? I asked only for a tea and you
brought all this stuff? I can't eat all this.

915
01:45:18,456 --> 01:45:20,151
I'm not hungry.

916
01:45:20,591 --> 01:45:22,786
What you don't have is not hunger
but money. Eat!

917
01:45:26,230 --> 01:45:29,495
"Did you fail in exams and run away?
I'll pay the fare, go back."

918
01:45:29,633 --> 01:45:31,100
How much your parents must be missing you!

919
01:45:31,268 --> 01:45:34,032
"My mother and father are dead, sir
I don't have any body."

920
01:45:35,606 --> 01:45:36,930
Alas, then, how?"

921
01:45:37,008 --> 01:45:39,000
Ask all that later. First let the boy eat
and fill his stomach.

922
01:45:39,001 --> 01:45:40,125
"Eat boy.
No, ma'am."

923
01:45:40,511 --> 01:45:41,842
I won't charge you money, eat."

924
01:45:42,046 --> 01:45:44,537
"if it comes free, one shouldn't accept
even gold - that's what my mother told."

925
01:45:47,752 --> 01:45:49,743
"I came to this Gangotri on a
certain work, sir.On work"

926
01:45:50,955 --> 01:45:54,083
"I mean, for work sir. if you'd give me
some work ...I'll eat all these."

927
01:45:55,292 --> 01:45:57,783
"I'll clean the tables, supply the orders
Any work I'll do."

928
01:45:59,130 --> 01:46:01,189
I like you boy. Certainly I'll give you work.
Now eat first.

929
01:46:08,139 --> 01:46:10,801
Though he's hungry he refused to eat

930
01:46:10,908 --> 01:46:13,408
His mother must to be truly fortunate
to raise such a son!

931
01:46:50,514 --> 01:46:53,677
"My dear, aren't you! it's been four days
since you ate! Just have one morsel!"

932
01:46:53,784 --> 01:46:55,183
"I don't want.
Please baby, eat!"

933
01:46:56,454 --> 01:47:00,948
"What you!, I've been watching a while now!
You keep pleading with her like that"

934
01:47:01,158 --> 01:47:06,460
"Look! if you go hungry,
you'll faint!"

935
01:47:08,933 --> 01:47:14,530
"What that look? Like a ghost? Here, eat
these morsels! Why so adamant!"

936
01:47:15,773 --> 01:47:18,207
"Open your mouth! Open, you demon!
Will you eat or should I stuff you?"

937
01:47:18,876 --> 01:47:20,136
Look here, now I'll stuff you with ..."

938
01:47:21,212 --> 01:47:25,706
"Sister, sister, what kind of talk is that?
Give that plate here. You go. Go on."

939
01:47:26,884 --> 01:47:31,378
"What will they feed you? Look baby, I'll
feed you. This morsel for mom ..."

940
01:47:32,823 --> 01:47:36,156
Don't want? Okay, set it aside."

941
01:47:41,232 --> 01:47:44,224
This morsel for dad... Don't want? Shall we
listen to this old song?

942
01:47:44,268 --> 01:47:45,895
Oh what a wedding feast!
Many special dishes

943
01:47:47,238 --> 01:47:49,729
The in-laws throw this feast
it's all for me only first!

944
01:47:52,576 --> 01:47:58,572
"Gangotri! What dear, you're angry?
Come come come, angry?"

945
01:47:58,682 --> 01:48:02,345
With your dad you're angry? Then don't
talk to me. But to give up food...

946
01:48:03,787 --> 01:48:10,249
Aren't you my golden dear? Come eat...
Come baby... Eat eat Gangotri...

947
01:48:10,394 --> 01:48:14,922
I never even plead with God... I'm pleading
with you come come eat.

948
01:48:15,266 --> 01:48:16,255
No!

949
01:48:18,302 --> 01:48:21,601
Gangotri... Stop this. This is beyond
reason... Eat. Eat Gangotri.

950
01:48:21,772 --> 01:48:25,606
Don't let daddy get angry. if I get angry
I'm not human anymore - you know that

951
01:48:25,743 --> 01:48:29,144
eat eat eat... if you don't want, then die!"

952
01:48:36,287 --> 01:48:39,482
"You don't know sir, the tiff ins here are
very tasty."

953
01:48:39,557 --> 01:48:41,053
Sir, I brought Telugu
people from our Andhra."

954
01:48:41,091 --> 01:48:43,218
"Ah, come... Please come... Greetings
...You are all Telugu?"

955
01:48:43,294 --> 01:48:45,990
"Not only Telugus, but very brilliant too
Straight from Tenali we are!"

956
01:48:47,197 --> 01:48:49,324
Sir, will you eat in
plates or in the leaves?"

957
01:48:50,834 --> 01:48:52,961
Meaning... Will you eat
in plates or in leaves?

958
01:48:53,604 --> 01:48:54,828
What's the use if one eats in leaves?

959
01:48:54,905 --> 01:48:58,068
"Nothing... Along with the tiff in, you can
also gobble up the leaves... Huh ..."

960
01:48:58,142 --> 01:48:59,632
Please sit down. Sit down...

961
01:48:59,977 --> 01:49:02,138
What! Comedy in Gangotri, eh? You come."

962
01:49:06,951 --> 01:49:08,009
What do you like sir?

963
01:49:08,352 --> 01:49:10,149
Ls the idli hot?

964
01:49:11,055 --> 01:49:13,216
Oh it is, it's round like
your wife's bangles."

965
01:49:13,824 --> 01:49:14,848
the pancakes?

966
01:49:14,992 --> 01:49:16,653
Oh yes, as big as your wife's waist-belt."

967
01:49:16,727 --> 01:49:17,694
Vada?

968
01:49:18,162 --> 01:49:20,892
Oh that, round like the
locket in her necklace."

969
01:49:21,332 --> 01:49:23,323
"What's this, you won't talk except
in reference to jewels?"

970
01:49:25,002 --> 01:49:27,593
"Look here, everyone's eyes are glued to
your jewels. Shut down that exhibition!"

971
01:49:27,771 --> 01:49:29,463
Except on Sunday I won't close the
jewels exhibition

972
01:49:29,807 --> 01:49:31,069
Yeah, a big wholesale merchant she is!"

973
01:49:32,376 --> 01:49:34,867
"Okay, go and get three plates idli,
three plates vada, three plates upma"

974
01:49:35,346 --> 01:49:37,371
"Father, all that will be enough for me!
For you both?"

975
01:49:37,514 --> 01:49:40,382
"if you eat all that, your belly will burst
and you'll die, curse on your mother!"

976
01:49:40,451 --> 01:49:41,713
All your traits - why curse me?

977
01:49:42,353 --> 01:49:44,014
She is gold... All rolled gold

978
01:49:44,989 --> 01:49:47,583
She is McKenna's Gold - what's it to you?
You go - you can go!

979
01:49:57,067 --> 01:50:01,367
Girl! The diamond necklace in your
neck looks very pleasing.

980
01:50:01,472 --> 01:50:02,734
Thank you, holy sir."

981
01:50:02,906 --> 01:50:06,501
Like the beads in this prayer string
are there 108 diamonds in your necklace?

982
01:50:06,710 --> 01:50:08,837
Don't know, holy sir! Will you count!"

983
01:50:08,979 --> 01:50:10,037
Give it here.

984
01:50:10,381 --> 01:50:13,748
What counting? He'll just flick it. You bloody...
Go on... I'll kill you take care!

985
01:50:14,519 --> 01:50:17,316
You're a fine one... Say you won't open
on Sunday... But the display is on 24 hours...

986
01:50:17,388 --> 01:50:18,946
Curse on your mother!

987
01:50:22,126 --> 01:50:25,994
"What Sambho? Your false prayer ...I'll kill
you, be careful. Bloody wretched fellow."

988
01:50:27,464 --> 01:50:29,455
What else would you like sir?

989
01:50:29,533 --> 01:50:30,932
I'd like a discount on the bill.

990
01:50:30,968 --> 01:50:33,027
"We don't give discount, sir. Some items
are given free, though"

991
01:50:33,404 --> 01:50:35,031
You'll give free? Like what?

992
01:50:35,606 --> 01:50:38,006
Free chatni with idli...
Free sambar with vada

993
01:50:38,409 --> 01:50:40,138
Curry free with poori

994
01:50:41,412 --> 01:50:44,813
Koorma free with chapathi
Free Free... Free

995
01:50:45,349 --> 01:50:47,579
"What he's talking just like that, the same
dialogue too..."

996
01:50:56,093 --> 01:50:59,221
"Wow, what's this? Why these photos
are stuck here?"

997
01:50:59,296 --> 01:51:02,231
The people in that poster are masters
in conning.

998
01:51:02,433 --> 01:51:03,422
Really?

999
01:51:03,734 --> 01:51:05,893
They murdered some hundred women
in Benares and stole their jewels.

1000
01:51:07,171 --> 01:51:10,538
"If they are caught, ten lakhs reward.
They are around this Gangotri area"

1001
01:51:11,608 --> 01:51:14,702
Oh curse them. These fellows turned up
here as well. Here... Now...

1002
01:51:16,847 --> 01:51:20,749
"Just five minutes ago, just where you're
sitting now, they sat and ate their tiff in."

1003
01:51:20,851 --> 01:51:24,446
Oh my God!... They were here? What
you still looking at? Let's go.

1004
01:51:24,488 --> 01:51:26,183
What Tenali man! Eat your tiff in and go!

1005
01:51:27,491 --> 01:51:29,461
"I don't want your tiff in, I don't want you

1006
01:51:29,462 --> 01:51:31,655
curse your mother! Here,
take all this change."

1007
01:51:32,830 --> 01:51:35,628
"Here gods are less in number and cheaters
are more. You close that jewel shop, you ..."

1008
01:51:35,766 --> 01:51:39,463
What a character form Tenali! Totally crazy
guy.Why drop this huge bag of change.

1009
01:51:39,837 --> 01:51:41,337
"On me, as if I'm begging!"

1010
01:51:46,744 --> 01:51:48,211
The boy in this photo, Simhadri..."

1011
01:51:48,378 --> 01:51:52,075
Worked for 10 years faithfully in our home
but ran away with 10 lakhs one day.

1012
01:51:53,450 --> 01:51:56,112
Whoever can inform his whereabouts will be
given a reward of one lakh rupees.

1013
01:52:08,999 --> 01:52:13,299
"Hey, accursed fellow! You lied to me?
You cheat me? You lied to me? I'll ..."

1014
01:52:13,504 --> 01:52:15,071
Uncle... Uncle... Uncle...
What happened uncle?

1015
01:52:16,240 --> 01:52:18,606
"You ran away after burglary, but you lied
to me that you're an orphan!"

1016
01:52:18,675 --> 01:52:20,836
"Uncle, I'm really an orphan!, uncle.
What I tell is the truth uncle!"

1017
01:52:21,078 --> 01:52:23,205
"What truth? So, this announcement
in the paper - is it false?"

1018
01:52:26,016 --> 01:52:28,780
"This is a bald lie, uncle. They want to kill
me, so they wrote that."

1019
01:52:29,119 --> 01:52:30,381
To kill you ...?

1020
01:52:30,687 --> 01:52:34,783
"Yes uncle. if you'd listen to me,
you'll find out the truth yourself"

1021
01:53:01,285 --> 01:53:04,345
"To make you believe what I said, I can't
offer any more proof, uncle."

1022
01:53:05,856 --> 01:53:08,552
"Since I announced that I loved Gangotri
they want to kill me,"

1023
01:53:08,692 --> 01:53:10,717
"so they must have given
the announcement, uncle."

1024
01:53:12,329 --> 01:53:14,524
"When Gangotri comes here for her last
ritual bath,"

1025
01:53:15,866 --> 01:53:17,595
"I thought I could meet her,
so I came here, uncle."

1026
01:53:18,402 --> 01:53:21,494
I will bring you both together.
I too loved and married.

1027
01:53:21,495 --> 01:53:23,339
When they tried to separate us...

1028
01:53:24,675 --> 01:53:27,735
"In the name of religion, we exiled them!
I'll be the guardian of your love."

1029
01:53:28,178 --> 01:53:29,406
I'll bring you both together.

1030
01:53:29,546 --> 01:53:33,448
"Uncle, not knowing where I am, my well being,
Ganga must be worried for me."

1031
01:53:33,550 --> 01:53:35,344
"You don't worry about a thing.
I'll go to your village,"

1032
01:53:35,418 --> 01:53:37,751
will meet Ganga and tell
her that you are safe.

1033
01:53:55,772 --> 01:53:59,731
Bring the soup and serve it properly!
Don't let the rice fall down.

1034
01:54:00,377 --> 01:54:03,141
"Greetings, lady! I am new here. Can you
direct me to Mr. Neelakantham's"

1035
01:54:03,247 --> 01:54:04,612
I am his wife

1036
01:54:09,119 --> 01:54:13,021
You look like a noble lady... I need to
discuss an important issue with you.

1037
01:54:27,404 --> 01:54:31,431
"So, Simhadri is safe with you? Very glad.
Not knowing where Simhadri went"

1038
01:54:32,676 --> 01:54:35,577
"what happened to him, how he is...
My daughter gave up food and sleep."

1039
01:54:37,648 --> 01:54:42,517
"it's for her sake, this free food is being given.
Like God himself, you came"

1040
01:54:44,688 --> 01:54:49,250
"with this glad news. You must tell this
good news to her, yourself and save her life."

1041
01:54:49,660 --> 01:54:50,649
please come in. Okay.

1042
01:55:06,510 --> 01:55:07,841
Didn't I say I won't eat? I don't want!

1043
01:55:10,881 --> 01:55:12,178
Wear this sweater...

1044
01:55:31,635 --> 01:55:34,195
Isn't this Simhadri's sweater?

1045
01:55:34,338 --> 01:55:37,102
Yes, dear. Simhadri is with me in Gangotri."

1046
01:55:44,181 --> 01:55:46,376
Uncle, How is Simhadri?"

1047
01:55:48,218 --> 01:55:52,279
He's well dear! He's waiting anxiously for you
to come there

1048
01:55:52,456 --> 01:55:56,051
for your last ritual bath. He keeps
dreaming of when he'll meet you again.

1049
01:56:05,102 --> 01:56:08,697
I'm hungry now, feed me, mom!"

1050
01:56:11,008 --> 01:56:14,671
"I'll feed her, give it here. After
seeing the announcement in the paper,"

1051
01:56:14,745 --> 01:56:18,408
"I thought that Simhadri was a thief, and I'd
beat him with these hands, baby!"

1052
01:56:18,548 --> 01:56:23,042
"With these same hands, I'll feed you and
wash off that sin."

1053
01:56:24,554 --> 01:56:27,216
"Uncle, Did you beat Simhadri
with these hands? Yes, dear."

1054
01:56:47,844 --> 01:56:49,106
I'll make a move now.

1055
01:57:00,957 --> 01:57:03,585
Hey, I saw you somewhere."

1056
01:57:04,628 --> 01:57:05,959
The hotel in Gangotri...

1057
01:57:06,096 --> 01:57:07,220
My name is Anjaneya Sastry, sir."

1058
01:57:07,264 --> 01:57:09,596
What are you doing here, tell me."

1059
01:57:09,800 --> 01:57:13,395
"Our place is the nearby Draksharamam.
Every year, I bring the new Ganges water"

1060
01:57:13,537 --> 01:57:15,934
to offer to Lord Bhimeswara at Draksharamam.
Wherever this water is sprinkled

1061
01:57:16,807 --> 01:57:19,435
that place is filled with the eight wealths.
Those suffering from mental worries

1062
01:57:20,877 --> 01:57:24,074
recover their peace of mind. That's why I
came and gave some of this water to the lady

1063
01:57:30,153 --> 01:57:32,553
"So, what Sastry, in your hotel you
have only those wretched Hindi people"

1064
01:57:32,656 --> 01:57:35,147
or did you get some of
our Telugu wretches also?

1065
01:57:35,258 --> 01:57:38,921
"No ma'am, I got some really sharp Telugu
fellows, like you said."

1066
01:57:39,529 --> 01:57:41,827
You will see for yourself when you come

1067
01:57:41,998 --> 01:57:43,659
I'll make a move

1068
01:57:53,844 --> 01:57:55,072
Hey brother!

1069
01:58:03,453 --> 01:58:08,481
"What's this, I feel different. Suddenly,
my mind is very calm."

1070
01:58:10,160 --> 01:58:11,422
So the Ganges water worked.

1071
01:58:12,262 --> 01:58:18,758
For a I week I thought I was going mad.but now
it feels pleasant. What happened Father?

1072
01:58:21,138 --> 01:58:25,404
Gangotri, it's the Ganges
The power of the Ganges ..."

1073
01:58:26,710 --> 01:58:28,940
Ganges water? Then give me some more.

1074
01:58:33,116 --> 01:58:36,984
Who... Who is it? What did you drop? Hey
I'm calling you. What is broken?

1075
01:58:38,555 --> 01:58:42,423
Dad, did you sprinkle this on auntie also?"

1076
01:58:55,939 --> 01:58:58,203
I'll break your arms and legs and your...

1077
01:59:00,544 --> 01:59:02,876
What brother, what did you pour on me?"

1078
01:59:04,381 --> 01:59:07,009
The Ganges...
The mother Ganges, sis... Gangotri ..."

1079
01:59:19,729 --> 01:59:22,093
"Uncle, uncle. Did you meet Ganga? Did
you talk to Ganga, uncle?"

1080
01:59:22,098 --> 01:59:25,590
What happened, uncle?"

1081
01:59:26,937 --> 01:59:28,871
She told to give this to you.

1082
01:59:29,172 --> 01:59:32,005
She told to give it? She
didn't say anything else?

1083
01:59:33,343 --> 01:59:36,677
"All she wanted to tell you, she wrote in
a letter and stuck it behind the train."

1084
02:00:03,940 --> 02:00:10,940
"Uncle! Uncle... Uncle! Uncle, my Ganga wrote
me a letter, uncle. Uncle"

1085
02:00:46,345 --> 02:00:49,644
Your steps as the melody...
Ringing aloud in my heart

1086
02:00:51,217 --> 02:00:53,412
becoming musical notes...
Drowning us in rapture

1087
02:00:55,021 --> 02:00:58,650
Ganga... Truly

1088
02:01:02,628 --> 02:01:04,493
You as one half of me...

1089
02:01:06,833 --> 02:01:10,269
Your steps as the melody...
Ringing aloud in my heart

1090
02:01:11,537 --> 02:01:14,005
becoming musical notes...
Drowning us in rapture

1091
02:01:17,977 --> 02:01:20,411
Your steps as the melody...
Ringing aloud in my heart

1092
02:01:20,880 --> 02:01:24,281
becoming musical notes...
Drowning us in rapture

1093
02:01:53,679 --> 02:01:55,510
The heart you gave is safe

1094
02:01:55,815 --> 02:01:57,282
The love you shared is safe

1095
02:01:57,750 --> 02:02:01,083
I am safe in you

1096
02:02:01,821 --> 02:02:03,652
The games we played are happy

1097
02:02:03,856 --> 02:02:05,721
The whispers of hearts are happy

1098
02:02:05,825 --> 02:02:08,885
The signs are that we'll be one, happily"

1099
02:02:10,096 --> 02:02:11,427
Your message I read

1100
02:02:12,165 --> 02:02:13,723
Your message I read

1101
02:02:15,501 --> 02:02:17,366
In every word, I see you"

1102
02:02:17,570 --> 02:02:19,731
The good fortune of past lives

1103
02:02:20,606 --> 02:02:26,203
Ganga... Truly...

1104
02:02:28,481 --> 02:02:30,108
You as one half of me...

1105
02:02:32,285 --> 02:02:35,948
Your steps as the melody...
Ringing aloud in my heart

1106
02:02:36,088 --> 02:02:39,990
becoming musical notes...
Drowning us in rapture

1107
02:03:15,294 --> 02:03:18,695
The flowers you sent arranged in my hair

1108
02:03:20,299 --> 02:03:22,563
your handwriting adorns my forehead

1109
02:03:24,003 --> 02:03:27,063
The thread of writing in your letter
a garland in my neck

1110
02:03:28,174 --> 02:03:30,734
it changed even my fate

1111
02:03:31,744 --> 02:03:34,713
This letter you wrote
meaningful to my heart

1112
02:03:35,314 --> 02:03:37,179
This signature you fixed

1113
02:03:38,751 --> 02:03:41,151
is the blessing for our love

1114
02:03:42,188 --> 02:03:49,188
Ganga... Truly ...You as one half of me...

1115
02:03:54,233 --> 02:03:57,464
Your steps as the melody...
Ringing aloud in my heart

1116
02:03:58,537 --> 02:04:01,768
becoming musical notes...
Drowning us in rapture

1117
02:04:04,277 --> 02:04:07,872
Your steps as the melody...
Ringing aloud in my heart

1118
02:04:09,348 --> 02:04:12,545
becoming musical notes...
Drowning us in rapture

1119
02:04:41,209 --> 02:04:45,805
"Simhadri! I'm coming to Gangotri. Oh Mother
Ganges, only you can join the two of us."

1120
02:04:47,448 --> 02:04:50,216
"I asked the fellow to show me some Sandal
wood. Where the hell did he go, stupid hell!"

1121
02:04:50,217 --> 02:04:52,038
"if aunty comes there,
the plan will backfire

1122
02:04:52,039 --> 02:04:53,780
I have to prevent her from coming some how"

1123
02:04:54,822 --> 02:05:00,124
"I have to do every damn thing in this house
Oh God,"

1124
02:05:00,228 --> 02:05:04,062
I hope this ladder won't break
under my weight. it's shaking...

1125
02:05:07,168 --> 02:05:13,004
Oh my God... Alas alas... it's broken
it's broken. My leg is broken. Oh God!

1126
02:05:13,140 --> 02:05:18,134
"Hey Ramdu, Hey Lakshmi... Come...
Where the hell are you all..."

1127
02:05:18,212 --> 02:05:19,304
What happened ma'am?

1128
02:05:19,714 --> 02:05:25,311
Alas, my leg is broken, Oh God"

1129
02:05:33,661 --> 02:05:38,655
"Why, we are going for the last ritual bath
of our daughter, you should be happy"

1130
02:05:39,133 --> 02:05:40,191
why are you like that?

1131
02:05:41,836 --> 02:05:48,136
"Tulasi, I'm an ignorant illiterate. Lost my
parents when very young. Since then..."

1132
02:05:48,277 --> 02:05:51,267
it was my sister who became mom dad
brother sister everything and raised me

1133
02:05:51,312 --> 02:05:55,180
I'm sad that I'm going without her.

1134
02:05:57,685 --> 02:06:00,085
So your dad doesn't know that you got
your auntie's leg broken.

1135
02:06:01,522 --> 02:06:03,649
"If that demon came along,
could I meet Simhadri?"

1136
02:06:03,691 --> 02:06:04,658
Hey brother!
Sis!

1137
02:06:09,664 --> 02:06:12,565
"I took permission from the doctor.
Here, he gave me this third leg."

1138
02:06:13,668 --> 02:06:15,295
Like this I'm coming, though wobbly. Wait!"

1139
02:06:16,370 --> 02:06:19,168
"Darn, this demon...
Uncle... Uncle..."

1140
02:06:21,776 --> 02:06:23,209
What's all this?

1141
02:06:24,745 --> 02:06:27,236
"Gangotri will come here for her bath on
her birthday, right?"

1142
02:06:29,150 --> 02:06:31,645
"Later when I take her away, no one
should think that I took her for her jewels"

1143
02:06:31,652 --> 02:06:33,918
"That's why I bought all these.
Are they good, auntie?"

1144
02:06:35,189 --> 02:06:36,349
They are really nice, boy."

1145
02:06:36,824 --> 02:06:39,384
"Well, if you spend all your savings like
this, how will you take care of her?"

1146
02:06:39,460 --> 02:06:45,922
"Just this one is enough to take care of
Gangotri, uncle!"

1147
02:06:49,370 --> 02:06:53,898
"Uncle, you looked at this orphan like your
own son."

1148
02:06:54,075 --> 02:06:55,523
"I too am sad to leave you and go.
Uncle, but

1149
02:06:55,524 --> 02:06:56,908
it is inevitable for the sake of Gangotri."

1150
02:06:58,813 --> 02:07:02,806
"Uncle, your name is Anjaneya Sastry, right?
And Anjaneya lives forever, uncle?"

1151
02:07:03,017 --> 02:07:06,748
"So that our love too will live forever,
bless me, uncle."

1152
02:07:09,924 --> 02:07:13,951
"You'll have along with my
blessings, those of Lord lndra,"

1153
02:07:14,095 --> 02:07:16,154
the Lord of all the elements
through all your life.

1154
02:07:19,767 --> 02:07:23,430
"Hey Satti, That Simhadri is in Gangotri
should not be known to Neelakantham Naidu"

1155
02:07:23,738 --> 02:07:26,434
you have to look after that.
No will suspect - I'll take care of it.

1156
02:07:49,163 --> 02:07:50,630
Hey Padma, get down, quick."

1157
02:08:36,510 --> 02:08:39,274
"Move quickly
Madam, sit in this."

1158
02:08:43,217 --> 02:08:46,084
"That's what irritates me. You're grown like
a pig, but can't even carry a pot."

1159
02:08:50,825 --> 02:08:53,184
"if the sandal paste spills, I'll drown you
in the Ganges. Move carefully."

1160
02:08:54,195 --> 02:08:57,289
Damn her twisting walk... Damn her twists
wretched one... Oh mother...

1161
02:08:59,033 --> 02:09:01,467
Hey brother, I'm dead! My back is broken."

1162
02:09:02,536 --> 02:09:04,936
"What sis? Some fellow tilted
my chair, brother, oh gosh."

1163
02:09:05,272 --> 02:09:10,039
You've grown too old and can't even see
what is where. Sit down. Tulasi!

1164
02:09:10,111 --> 02:09:11,373
Proceed with the ritual bath.
Okay.

1165
02:09:12,480 --> 02:09:16,041
With turmeric and vermillion,
with milk and perfume..."

1166
02:09:17,251 --> 02:09:21,278
...pure sandal paste and divine nectars
themselves

1167
02:09:24,558 --> 02:09:27,550
...washing every limb, removing every curse"

1168
02:09:29,196 --> 02:09:32,188
This sacred bath offered to Gangotri

1169
02:09:35,236 --> 02:09:38,569
Oh, mother Ganga"

1170
02:09:48,282 --> 02:09:55,282
"Simhadri's voice. This is Simhadri's song,
no doubt. Means, he came here"

1171
02:10:09,503 --> 02:10:14,031
"to Gangotri. He's here somewhere. Hey,
find him and cut him up. Go on. Go."

1172
02:10:15,576 --> 02:10:22,004
"Sir, stop, stop. Sir, sir, I just
recorded this as the song is good."

1173
02:10:24,251 --> 02:10:26,576
"When Simhadri came here last time, as
the song was good, he recorded it."

1174
02:10:30,624 --> 02:10:37,624
"Okay, press it.
Tell river Yamuna, to always bring help"

1175
02:10:43,771 --> 02:10:47,229
To Godavari and Kaveri, to brook and stream"

1176
02:10:48,843 --> 02:10:55,544
the falling rain and
the diving water fall to all your siblings

1177
02:10:57,551 --> 02:10:59,712
Please tell,"

1178
02:11:12,666 --> 02:11:18,298
The last ritual bath is completed. Your
Gangotri is now free of the water danger.

1179
02:11:19,506 --> 02:11:20,939
Now it will all be good fortune.

1180
02:11:20,940 --> 02:11:22,440
Now it will all be good fortune.

1181
02:11:27,577 --> 02:11:32,810
My Ganga is free of danger. My golden
child is freed from the evil.

1182
02:11:39,089 --> 02:11:42,547
This my Gangotri that was born to save my life
I managed to save her life.

1183
02:11:49,732 --> 02:11:52,701
"Not the five elements, nor the nine planets
not even the 30 million gods"

1184
02:11:54,104 --> 02:11:56,265
can take away my Ganga from me. Hey...

1185
02:11:59,442 --> 02:12:04,277
No one has the power to separate Ganga
from me...

1186
02:12:04,514 --> 02:12:06,505
My Ganga can not be taken away from me.

1187
02:12:27,804 --> 02:12:29,101
Who's that?

1188
02:12:31,674 --> 02:12:34,507
"You wretched fellow!, stop. Stop there.
Hey stop. Hey... Hey... Stop."

1189
02:12:37,013 --> 02:12:40,642
"Oh, my saree
My trident!"

1190
02:12:54,164 --> 02:12:57,031
"My gosh blood! Oh brother, that Simhadri is
running off with Gangotri."

1191
02:12:57,834 --> 02:13:04,834
"Hey, go after him. Catch him. Cut him into
little pieces and bring my Ganga back."

1192
02:13:06,876 --> 02:13:11,870
"To bring Ganga back, it's not possible
for your guys, nor even for you."

1193
02:13:13,483 --> 02:13:15,007
What nonsense are you talking?

1194
02:13:16,352 --> 02:13:19,651
"Once it starts in Himalayas, through
Rishikesh Haridvar, Benaras, and Allahabad"

1195
02:13:21,291 --> 02:13:23,825
the Ganges which blends into sea at last
- Even Lord Siva doesn't have the power

1196
02:13:25,028 --> 02:13:31,058
to separate her. To separate your Ganga
from the sea-like Simhadri is impossible

1197
02:13:31,234 --> 02:13:33,600
"for you, and even to the
One that created you."

1198
02:13:37,340 --> 02:13:39,535
I'll take care of this fellow -
you go look after Gangotri.

1199
02:15:00,723 --> 02:15:03,723
"Little lady, you move aside ...Little lady,
move your leg aside, I'll cut off his leg"

1200
02:19:46,108 --> 02:19:49,305
Where's that Simhadri
he's dead. Come.

1201
02:19:51,480 --> 02:19:55,143
I won't come. I won't come without Simhadri.
I can't live without Simhadri.

1202
02:19:56,319 --> 02:19:59,777
"You can't live without him? if you want to
live with him, then you have to die too."

1203
02:20:00,489 --> 02:20:02,980
Will you die? Tell, come on tell..."

1204
02:20:36,826 --> 02:20:38,123
Save my daughter!

1205
02:21:15,598 --> 02:21:18,032
Who are you to tell my daughter to die?

1206
02:21:19,902 --> 02:21:23,229
It's not now you should be beating her...
You know when she put the dirty color

1207
02:21:23,273 --> 02:21:25,672
on their young innocent love
you should've beaten her then.

1208
02:21:25,708 --> 02:21:29,166
What will this barren wretch know
the hearts of young ones?

1209
02:21:29,345 --> 02:21:32,246
Hey, if you talk any more, I'll kill you."

1210
02:21:32,314 --> 02:21:37,445
"Kill me. it's nothing new to you. Whoever
opposed you, whoever crossed you"

1211
02:21:37,553 --> 02:21:42,183
"you got them killed so far. At last,
you are killing your own daughter."

1212
02:21:42,358 --> 02:21:49,358
it's for the sin of being born as your daughter
you say you'll kill her.

1213
02:21:49,899 --> 02:21:53,835
"But that young boy, what sin did he do that
you got him beaten so badly?"

1214
02:21:55,871 --> 02:21:59,773
That he played with and regaled and raised
your daughter - you got him beaten?

1215
02:22:01,577 --> 02:22:05,980
"To save your life, his mother lost her life.
Ls that why you got him beaten?"

1216
02:22:06,082 --> 02:22:11,952
"For thirty years his father served you,
and in anger you murdered him and"

1217
02:22:12,221 --> 02:22:16,885
made this boy an orphan. You worried
about how an orphan will live...

1218
02:22:16,992 --> 02:22:18,320
Is that why you want to kill him?

1219
02:22:19,962 --> 02:22:23,728
Even the jungle animals kill other
animals only when they are hungry.

1220
02:22:23,899 --> 02:22:26,868
But you seem to want to devour those
who loved you. I loved you the most

1221
02:22:26,969 --> 02:22:33,969
more than any one. Kill me too. Kill me too.

1222
02:23:12,381 --> 02:23:15,475
I can't find the pulse. No breathing either.

1223
02:23:16,786 --> 02:23:22,349
Nothing happens. Nothing happens to my dear.
Just once get up

1224
02:23:24,326 --> 02:23:25,623
Tell my dear to talk to me...

1225
02:23:51,220 --> 02:23:55,316
"Just to protect your life, for these many
years I came here and offered up prayers."

1226
02:23:57,993 --> 02:24:02,930
"Yet, I could not find that your life wasn't
with you but with Simhadri."

1227
02:24:12,641 --> 02:24:15,838
"Look at me once. Dear, Tell her to look
at me just once."

1228
02:24:25,187 --> 02:24:27,451
To save one's life's not easy as killing.

1229
02:24:29,692 --> 02:24:31,057
Simhadri, get up."

1230
02:25:21,644 --> 02:25:28,644
"Simhadri, don't stop. With which song you
saved her once before,"

1231
02:25:33,489 --> 02:25:40,452
with the same song
you must save her once more.

1232
02:25:40,477 --> 02:25:44,477
