1
00:02:47,714 --> 00:02:51,309
I've been waiting for the moonlight

2
00:02:53,353 --> 00:02:57,949
I've been waiting
for the moonlit sky

3
00:02:58,558 --> 00:03:00,856
All night..

4
00:03:02,729 --> 00:03:05,323
Stranger in the moonlight

5
00:03:06,299 --> 00:03:10,633
I've been waiting for a lifetime

6
00:03:11,271 --> 00:03:12,568
For you..

7
00:03:13,707 --> 00:03:23,708
How I wish.. into my
dreams you'd glide..

8
00:03:24,017 --> 00:03:26,281
Hey you

9
00:03:26,586 --> 00:03:28,554
Hold me closer.

10
00:03:28,822 --> 00:03:31,017
Closer to you.

11
00:03:31,658 --> 00:03:39,588
As your fragrance I
want to be by your side..

12
00:03:42,369 --> 00:03:45,770
I've been waiting.. Waiting,
waiting..

13
00:03:45,906 --> 00:03:48,568
For the moonlight..

14
00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:51,609
.. for you.

15
00:03:54,347 --> 00:04:04,245
My life, my heart I gave it up..
All to win your love..

16
00:04:04,658 --> 00:04:12,861
There's a desire alive,
day and night..

17
00:04:13,033 --> 00:04:18,835
The Lord knows I'm right..

18
00:04:18,905 --> 00:04:22,466
This fire it burns untold..

19
00:04:22,542 --> 00:04:27,036
but still my spirit is so cold..

20
00:04:30,617 --> 00:04:33,984
I've been waiting for the moonlight

21
00:04:35,622 --> 00:04:40,559
I've been waiting
for the moonlit sky

22
00:04:40,961 --> 00:04:43,828
All night..

23
00:05:20,934 --> 00:05:22,765
- Hello
- Dost (Friend)

24
00:05:22,936 --> 00:05:24,301
Huh?

25
00:05:24,537 --> 00:05:26,334
I am standing outside my window.

26
00:05:26,406 --> 00:05:27,464
Why?

27
00:05:27,974 --> 00:05:29,373
To jump.

28
00:05:29,676 --> 00:05:31,007
Give me one good reason.

29
00:05:31,378 --> 00:05:32,470
A reason to jump?

30
00:05:32,545 --> 00:05:34,570
No. A reason to live.

31
00:05:35,015 --> 00:05:36,380
Who is this?

32
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:37,948
Akash

33
00:05:38,018 --> 00:05:42,512
- I think you've dialed the wrong..
- Fine! I'll jump off then.

34
00:05:42,589 --> 00:05:44,716
No. Wait.. Wait.

35
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:45,849
One reason.

36
00:05:45,925 --> 00:05:48,485
Please just give
me one good reason.

37
00:05:49,496 --> 00:05:51,327
What if you fall on someone else?

38
00:05:51,531 --> 00:05:52,725
What?

39
00:05:53,466 --> 00:05:54,626
What if you don't die?

40
00:05:54,701 --> 00:05:55,725
Hmm?

41
00:05:56,469 --> 00:05:57,766
You could get fractured.

42
00:05:57,837 --> 00:05:59,805
Or you could turn into a potato.

43
00:05:59,873 --> 00:06:00,862
Potato?

44
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:03,465
Yes. Vegetable. Brain damage.

45
00:06:03,543 --> 00:06:04,840
You won't be able to walk

46
00:06:04,911 --> 00:06:06,469
.. or eat.

47
00:06:06,713 --> 00:06:08,237
People will say 'Poor Akshay'.

48
00:06:08,314 --> 00:06:09,804
Akash. My name is Akash.

49
00:06:09,883 --> 00:06:12,818
But people will call you Akshay and
you wont be able to say anything.

50
00:06:13,019 --> 00:06:14,281
Oh.

51
00:06:14,421 --> 00:06:15,945
So please

52
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:17,987
Step back inside

53
00:06:18,758 --> 00:06:19,986
You're right.

54
00:06:20,527 --> 00:06:22,586
Thank you friend. Thank you.

55
00:06:22,729 --> 00:06:24,026
You're welcome.

56
00:06:25,465 --> 00:06:26,625
Akash?

57
00:06:59,032 --> 00:07:00,294
Hello?

58
00:07:06,573 --> 00:07:07,631
Hello.

59
00:07:07,707 --> 00:07:10,403
Enough my friend. I don't
want to live any longer.

60
00:07:10,477 --> 00:07:11,774
Akshay?
- What?

61
00:07:11,811 --> 00:07:13,278
Sorry. Akash?

62
00:07:13,346 --> 00:07:15,678
No. This is Aman.

63
00:07:16,316 --> 00:07:17,510
Is this a joke?

64
00:07:17,584 --> 00:07:18,642
Joke?

65
00:07:18,718 --> 00:07:20,549
I am committing suicide.

66
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,244
Why should I care?

67
00:07:22,322 --> 00:07:24,552
Stop me my friend.

68
00:07:24,624 --> 00:07:26,421
Ok. Don't commit suicide.
You'll die.

69
00:07:26,493 --> 00:07:28,927
If you don't die,
you'll go to jail.

70
00:07:29,262 --> 00:07:30,354
Bad idea.

71
00:07:30,396 --> 00:07:31,488
Bad idea?

72
00:07:31,564 --> 00:07:34,431
Bad idea. Just go to sleep.
Don't commit suicide.

73
00:07:34,501 --> 00:07:37,265
Ok. No suicide.. Thank you friend.

74
00:07:37,337 --> 00:07:38,770
Good night

75
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:08,826
Hello?

76
00:08:08,902 --> 00:08:10,494
I want to die.

77
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:12,235
Then die.

78
00:08:12,305 --> 00:08:13,363
What?

79
00:08:13,406 --> 00:08:16,000
Die. Finish it off.. I don't care.

80
00:08:16,276 --> 00:08:17,368
What are you saying my friend.

81
00:08:17,443 --> 00:08:18,967
Just die. No one cares.

82
00:08:19,245 --> 00:08:20,303
My mom cares.

83
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:22,871
I'll pacify her.. You die!

84
00:08:23,016 --> 00:08:24,244
What about my girlfriend?

85
00:08:24,317 --> 00:08:26,683
She'll find another boyfriend.
She'll be very happy.

86
00:08:26,753 --> 00:08:28,015
You die!
- My friends?

87
00:08:28,288 --> 00:08:29,653
No one could care less.

88
00:08:29,722 --> 00:08:31,383
You die! You die!

89
00:08:31,457 --> 00:08:33,618
Of course they care.
Everyone cares.

90
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,024
I will not die.
Do whatever you can do.

91
00:09:04,524 --> 00:09:05,923
You look like shit.

92
00:09:05,959 --> 00:09:07,517
Thanks.

93
00:09:09,329 --> 00:09:10,694
Let me guess.

94
00:09:10,997 --> 00:09:13,295
You broke up with
Kutti-ka (bitch).

95
00:09:13,366 --> 00:09:15,391
Her name is Krutika.

96
00:09:16,436 --> 00:09:17,562
Woof.

97
00:09:18,538 --> 00:09:20,802
- Good Morning.
- Good Morning Sid.

98
00:09:21,941 --> 00:09:22,999
Gosh!

99
00:09:23,276 --> 00:09:25,506
You know what
they'd say in Pakistan?

100
00:09:25,578 --> 00:09:26,602
What?

101
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:29,011
Your face looks
like a hammered horse

102
00:09:30,483 --> 00:09:32,508
They called you 'Dost' (Friend)?

103
00:09:33,553 --> 00:09:35,384
Are you sure it was a prank?

104
00:09:35,421 --> 00:09:36,786
Of course it was a prank

105
00:09:37,423 --> 00:09:38,617
How can you be sure?

106
00:09:38,691 --> 00:09:40,022
Check the newspaper.

107
00:09:40,293 --> 00:09:41,988
What if some Akshay
actually committed suicide?

108
00:09:42,262 --> 00:09:44,423
Brother. Finish your breakfast.

109
00:09:44,664 --> 00:09:46,632
This happened just two hours ago.

110
00:09:48,401 --> 00:09:49,766
Weird.

111
00:09:50,036 --> 00:09:51,560
Very weird.

112
00:09:52,405 --> 00:09:53,667
Absolutely weird.

113
00:10:09,956 --> 00:10:11,014
Seriously.

114
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:12,519
Who could it be?

115
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:14,290
Uday.

116
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,418
Uday?

117
00:10:15,461 --> 00:10:17,053
You think he'll leave
the guys at the nightclub?

118
00:10:17,363 --> 00:10:18,421
No chance.

119
00:10:18,464 --> 00:10:19,556
Omar.

120
00:10:19,766 --> 00:10:21,358
It wasn't you, right?

121
00:10:22,035 --> 00:10:23,434
There you go.

122
00:10:23,503 --> 00:10:25,334
Spoke like a true Indian.

123
00:10:25,405 --> 00:10:27,066
Yes. It was me.

124
00:10:27,407 --> 00:10:29,739
And the ISI. Along
with Nawaz Sharif.

125
00:10:29,909 --> 00:10:31,035
And the ex prime minister Musharraf.

126
00:10:31,311 --> 00:10:33,677
He came out of
retirementjust to trouble you.

127
00:10:35,014 --> 00:10:36,879
Then who could it be?

128
00:10:37,383 --> 00:10:39,044
Who has such a
weird sense of humor?

129
00:10:39,485 --> 00:10:40,679
Thank you.

130
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:45,355
- Amit!
- Amit!

131
00:10:52,598 --> 00:10:54,429
Guys! Listen to this

132
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,992
Some Indian tantriks
eat their own shit.

133
00:10:59,405 --> 00:11:01,270
How weird is that?

134
00:11:03,676 --> 00:11:04,802
Me?

135
00:11:05,745 --> 00:11:07,372
Am I that weird?

136
00:11:07,814 --> 00:11:09,782
Or do I have so much free time?

137
00:11:16,723 --> 00:11:17,883
Guys

138
00:11:17,924 --> 00:11:18,982
I know who it was

139
00:11:19,058 --> 00:11:20,389
Who?

140
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:22,553
A secret organization

141
00:11:22,628 --> 00:11:23,686
Just think

142
00:11:23,763 --> 00:11:26,391
What did all of them
call you? Dost (Friend)

143
00:11:26,466 --> 00:11:28,957
I think it's a code word.

144
00:11:29,068 --> 00:11:31,366
D-O-S-T

145
00:11:32,505 --> 00:11:35,497
Department of Secret..

146
00:11:36,676 --> 00:11:37,802
.. Things

147
00:11:37,877 --> 00:11:38,969
Right.

148
00:11:39,045 --> 00:11:41,479
Must have been James Bond.

149
00:11:47,653 --> 00:11:48,745
May I help you please?

150
00:11:48,821 --> 00:11:52,552
Yes. Do you have the
'Tao Te Ching'?

151
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:55,492
Mam, if you want real philosophy

152
00:11:56,329 --> 00:11:57,956
Try the 'Bhagawad Geeta'

153
00:11:58,064 --> 00:12:00,555
Its much more.. philosophical.

154
00:12:00,767 --> 00:12:02,894
- Oh Really.
- Absolutely.

155
00:12:02,969 --> 00:12:05,529
Hardly any Indians read
'Tao te ching' anymore

156
00:12:05,605 --> 00:12:07,596
That's because its
not an Indian book.

157
00:12:07,673 --> 00:12:08,867
It's Chinese.

158
00:12:09,542 --> 00:12:12,375
I am sorry. We don't have it.

159
00:12:13,479 --> 00:12:15,003
What sort of an Indian are you?

160
00:12:15,415 --> 00:12:18,543
You give Bhagwad Geeta lesser
importance than a Chinese book.

161
00:12:18,785 --> 00:12:20,844
Omar.. Shut Up.

162
00:12:21,721 --> 00:12:24,281
A special edition worth 30 Pounds

163
00:12:24,357 --> 00:12:25,949
It would've looked
beautiful in her collection.

164
00:12:26,025 --> 00:12:29,461
She wanted something else. Who
are you to decide what she needs?

165
00:12:30,029 --> 00:12:32,395
As if she'll
understand 'Tao' philsphy.

166
00:12:32,665 --> 00:12:33,757
First page.

167
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:37,929
''The path you can follow is
not the real path at all.''

168
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:39,767
Wow.

169
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:42,874
Did you understand
the Bhagwad Geeta?

170
00:12:43,309 --> 00:12:45,573
Do the labor without
worrying about the fruit.

171
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:48,513
Omar!
- Share it you bugger.

172
00:12:48,581 --> 00:12:50,811
He has just been
staring at the last piece.

173
00:12:51,717 --> 00:12:53,776
Go ahead. Eat it.

174
00:12:53,986 --> 00:12:55,886
I was happily doing the labor.

175
00:12:55,955 --> 00:12:59,755
You threw my fruit
towards China town.

176
00:13:13,706 --> 00:13:14,866
Hi.

177
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:17,976
Do you have Yog Bashisht?

178
00:13:18,845 --> 00:13:20,870
Yog Bashisht.

179
00:13:22,048 --> 00:13:23,982
Ya-Yog Vashisht?

180
00:13:24,684 --> 00:13:28,484
In fact, I am just
reading it right now

181
00:13:29,055 --> 00:13:32,582
Just a second. I'll get it for you.

182
00:13:34,727 --> 00:13:36,592
How cute is she?
- Seven?

183
00:13:36,629 --> 00:13:37,994
Nope. Fourteen.

184
00:13:38,064 --> 00:13:39,929
Would you like it gift-wrapped?

185
00:13:39,999 --> 00:13:41,557
No thank you.

186
00:13:41,634 --> 00:13:43,295
How much?

187
00:13:48,341 --> 00:13:49,501
- Hey Amit.
- Ya?

188
00:13:49,575 --> 00:13:51,634
Come home for dinner tonight.
Aliya is cooking.

189
00:13:51,711 --> 00:13:52,803
What's the occasion?

190
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:55,848
Uday is bringing over his
new boyfriend for her approval.

191
00:13:56,015 --> 00:13:58,040
Do come.. It'll be fun.

192
00:14:05,258 --> 00:14:06,782
What if you get those
calls again tonight?

193
00:14:06,826 --> 00:14:08,384
I'll call the cops.

194
00:14:08,761 --> 00:14:11,286
The sun doesn't set
till 10 pm anyway.

195
00:14:11,531 --> 00:14:13,624
I hardly get any sleep, and..

196
00:14:14,934 --> 00:14:16,595
Siddharth Arya?

197
00:14:18,604 --> 00:14:20,265
Suhana Malik.

198
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:22,371
DOST India.

199
00:14:25,378 --> 00:14:30,873
We are a suicide helpline
for Indians living in London

200
00:14:31,284 --> 00:14:32,308
Oh

201
00:14:32,385 --> 00:14:34,945
I am so sorry for our mistake.

202
00:14:35,021 --> 00:14:36,989
Mistake?

203
00:14:37,557 --> 00:14:39,422
The phone number!

204
00:14:39,692 --> 00:14:42,718
This.. this is my.. number.

205
00:14:43,563 --> 00:14:44,655
Yes I know..

206
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:47,358
Shit.. Last Night..
those phone calls.

207
00:14:47,433 --> 00:14:48,900
Akash. Aman.

208
00:14:48,968 --> 00:14:51,698
Nothing happened last night. We
stay in contact with the police.

209
00:14:51,771 --> 00:14:53,033
What about all day today?

210
00:14:53,306 --> 00:14:55,900
Its all right. We are
a night-time help line.

211
00:14:56,542 --> 00:14:57,839
Oh.

212
00:14:59,946 --> 00:15:02,847
Why? Doesn't anyone
commit suicide in the day?

213
00:15:04,283 --> 00:15:07,878
Statistically most people
commit suicide at night.

214
00:15:08,654 --> 00:15:11,555
Besides, we are all volunteers.

215
00:15:11,724 --> 00:15:14,591
We study or work in the day.

216
00:15:14,827 --> 00:15:19,662
And run the helpline at
night from a college campus.

217
00:15:20,967 --> 00:15:26,564
So what should I tell the callers?
Should I give them your number?

218
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:30,434
Well if someone calls in such
a situation and you say it's..

219
00:15:30,509 --> 00:15:32,477
..a wrong number then..

220
00:15:32,545 --> 00:15:34,706
Look, I know its asking for a lot

221
00:15:34,747 --> 00:15:39,650
But would it be ok if
one of our volunteers..

222
00:15:39,685 --> 00:15:41,915
.. stays at your
place for a few nights

223
00:15:41,988 --> 00:15:44,479
What? All night long?

224
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:45,952
Please Siddharth.

225
00:15:46,425 --> 00:15:47,983
These are all our own people.

226
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:50,585
They are sad and lonely

227
00:15:50,763 --> 00:15:54,756
They've forgotten how
beautiful life can be

228
00:15:55,501 --> 00:16:00,302
And this life is all
we have, isn't it?

229
00:16:08,848 --> 00:16:10,008
I'll do it.

230
00:16:10,283 --> 00:16:11,341
What?

231
00:16:11,417 --> 00:16:14,682
I'll help. I'll do it.

232
00:16:14,754 --> 00:16:19,282
That's great. That's.. great.

233
00:16:19,358 --> 00:16:22,816
But.. you..

234
00:16:22,895 --> 00:16:24,294
My stammer?

235
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:25,488
Yeah

236
00:16:25,531 --> 00:16:27,499
Don't worry. Doesn't
happen all the time.

237
00:16:27,566 --> 00:16:29,830
Just in front of pretty girls.

238
00:16:32,571 --> 00:16:33,731
I mean..

239
00:16:33,806 --> 00:16:35,034
Thank you

240
00:16:35,308 --> 00:16:37,742
I never stammer on the phone.

241
00:16:38,644 --> 00:16:40,737
You are a really nice guy.

242
00:16:41,314 --> 00:16:43,441
So what do I have to do?

243
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,914
Shall we start?

244
00:16:49,388 --> 00:16:51,447
I want to commit suicide.

245
00:16:51,524 --> 00:16:52,752
Why?

246
00:16:52,825 --> 00:16:54,292
My wife died.

247
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,055
There must be other
people who love you.

248
00:16:56,329 --> 00:16:57,421
Your mom?

249
00:16:57,496 --> 00:16:59,327
- Dead
- Dead?

250
00:16:59,965 --> 00:17:02,331
Father? Brother? Sister?

251
00:17:02,401 --> 00:17:03,425
Dead.

252
00:17:03,502 --> 00:17:05,436
- Your friends?
- All dead.

253
00:17:05,604 --> 00:17:09,301
Crazy party. Drug overdose.
All dead.

254
00:17:09,608 --> 00:17:11,439
- Hello
- Hey guys

255
00:17:11,477 --> 00:17:13,502
Hi Aliya. Hey Sid

256
00:17:13,713 --> 00:17:15,237
Hey Uday

257
00:17:15,348 --> 00:17:16,679
Hey Amit

258
00:17:17,249 --> 00:17:19,979
Meet my friend Ajay.

259
00:17:26,726 --> 00:17:27,886
Choose life.

260
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,359
A counselor's guide?

261
00:17:29,662 --> 00:17:32,631
Those calls were
actual suicide calls.

262
00:17:32,698 --> 00:17:36,327
And Sid wants to
sacrifice his sleep to save them.

263
00:17:36,402 --> 00:17:40,395
I don't understand you guys. If a
suicidal person calls me for help

264
00:17:40,473 --> 00:17:43,499
What am I supposed to say?
Sorry friend, I want to sleep.

265
00:17:43,576 --> 00:17:46,568
Wrong Number! Go
ahead and kill yourself?

266
00:17:47,346 --> 00:17:49,337
Self importance.

267
00:17:49,749 --> 00:17:51,546
Are you qualified to do this?

268
00:17:51,617 --> 00:17:54,916
This is dangerous.
And probably illegal.

269
00:17:54,987 --> 00:17:56,784
What Ajay means is..

270
00:17:56,856 --> 00:17:58,949
Sid should let
professionals handle this.

271
00:17:59,024 --> 00:18:02,255
I don't need any
qualifications to sympathize

272
00:18:02,461 --> 00:18:04,452
Suhana's other
volunteers aren't qualified either

273
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:07,931
And Suhana's rating.. Eight on ten!

274
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:09,426
Gosh!

275
00:18:09,502 --> 00:18:12,335
So that's the reason for
this sudden spurt of humanity.

276
00:18:12,405 --> 00:18:14,339
No Aliya.. It's not like that.

277
00:18:15,241 --> 00:18:20,304
We are connected to
each other since eternity.

278
00:18:20,379 --> 00:18:25,248
How else do you
explain such chemistry?

279
00:18:25,317 --> 00:18:31,017
Whether you accept it or not.

280
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:32,814
Nick. Stop it.

281
00:18:33,492 --> 00:18:34,584
Aliya.

282
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:40,326
The most beautiful, perfect,
lovely creature in the world

283
00:18:40,866 --> 00:18:43,357
Will you marry me?

284
00:18:45,504 --> 00:18:47,734
I think the chicken is done.

285
00:18:49,909 --> 00:18:51,001
Who is that?

286
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:52,570
Nick

287
00:18:52,945 --> 00:18:55,038
Why is he proposing
to a pregnant girl?

288
00:18:55,314 --> 00:18:59,808
That 'pregnant' girl is my sister.
And that is her boyfriend.

289
00:19:02,455 --> 00:19:04,923
- Whose baby is it?
- It's Nick's baby. Chill.

290
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:06,617
Then why isn't she marrying him?

291
00:19:06,692 --> 00:19:07,818
Wow Omar.

292
00:19:07,893 --> 00:19:09,690
How come we never
got this bright idea?

293
00:19:09,762 --> 00:19:12,526
They've been together for 5 years.
And now 5 months pregnant.

294
00:19:12,598 --> 00:19:16,329
- They must get married now.
- Wow. What a smart observation.

295
00:19:16,402 --> 00:19:18,336
Topic change. God
forbid if Aliya heard you..

296
00:19:18,404 --> 00:19:21,896
Aliya. Why don't
you just marry Nick?

297
00:19:22,241 --> 00:19:25,699
He is the father of your child
and he is proposing marriage.

298
00:19:25,778 --> 00:19:31,444
Grace! Grace! Let's pray and eat.

299
00:19:44,897 --> 00:19:46,330
Surprise!

300
00:19:46,398 --> 00:19:47,592
Hey its Krutika.

301
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:50,396
- Hi Krutika.
- Hi Uday.

302
00:19:50,469 --> 00:19:53,029
- Hi.
- Hi baby.

303
00:19:57,476 --> 00:19:59,603
Oh. Ok.

304
00:20:01,814 --> 00:20:03,042
Thanks honey.

305
00:20:03,482 --> 00:20:05,882
Honey you need more greens.

306
00:20:10,956 --> 00:20:12,321
How are you Krutika?

307
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:13,925
I am fine Omar.

308
00:20:13,993 --> 00:20:16,291
And how was Delhi Krutika?

309
00:20:16,362 --> 00:20:18,592
Just like it was last week Omar.

310
00:20:18,664 --> 00:20:19,756
Gosh!

311
00:20:19,832 --> 00:20:21,527
What love!

312
00:20:21,901 --> 00:20:23,596
Sid I am wondering

313
00:20:23,869 --> 00:20:25,928
What if someone dies?

314
00:20:26,372 --> 00:20:29,830
- Who will be responsible?
You? - Hello!

315
00:20:30,376 --> 00:20:33,504
If he is unable to stop someone,
Why should he be held responsible?

316
00:20:33,579 --> 00:20:35,638
At least the guy tried.

317
00:20:35,814 --> 00:20:38,578
Typical Pakistani attitude.

318
00:20:39,618 --> 00:20:43,520
Somebody did something.. We couldn't
stop them.. What can we do?

319
00:20:43,589 --> 00:20:45,750
Hey.. What's going on?

320
00:20:49,428 --> 00:20:52,556
Just listen to me Riya.
Just listen to me.

321
00:20:52,798 --> 00:20:55,824
That doesn't mean he
didn't love your mom

322
00:20:58,804 --> 00:21:02,604
No one can replace you or
your mom in your dad's life.

323
00:21:03,475 --> 00:21:05,602
Why don't you write him a letter?

324
00:21:05,678 --> 00:21:07,908
Just tell him how you feel.

325
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:10,041
He'll understand

326
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:14,446
And if you feel like talking to
someone again, our new number is

327
00:21:17,923 --> 00:21:19,686
Ok Riya. Bye.

328
00:21:21,493 --> 00:21:22,721
Are you insane?

329
00:21:22,795 --> 00:21:25,855
You've been talking to this
Reena for the last 10 minutes.

330
00:21:25,931 --> 00:21:27,592
Huh? Riya.

331
00:21:28,467 --> 00:21:29,593
- Sorry.
- What sorry?

332
00:21:29,668 --> 00:21:30,760
Just hang up!

333
00:21:30,836 --> 00:21:32,633
Tell them your girlfriend
has returned after a week.

334
00:21:32,705 --> 00:21:33,967
Sweetheart these
people are troubled.

335
00:21:34,039 --> 00:21:37,873
Come on Sid. If someone really wants
to die, they don't make such calls.

336
00:21:37,943 --> 00:21:39,535
Bloody attention seekers.

337
00:21:43,582 --> 00:21:46,050
Ok tell me. How was your flight?

338
00:21:46,852 --> 00:21:47,944
Typical.

339
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:52,013
Economy passengers treat
flight attendants like waitresses.

340
00:21:53,892 --> 00:21:55,792
I feel like slapping them hard.

341
00:21:56,328 --> 00:21:57,625
By the way

342
00:21:59,098 --> 00:22:00,827
You had promised me something.

343
00:22:00,899 --> 00:22:02,457
Promise?

344
00:22:04,436 --> 00:22:05,835
Oh, your parents?

345
00:22:06,405 --> 00:22:07,770
Of course I'll meet them.

346
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,673
Am not talking about that,
I'm talking about these.

347
00:22:10,743 --> 00:22:13,712
Oh yes, I will get contact lenses.

348
00:22:13,779 --> 00:22:15,679
- When?
- Very soon.

349
00:22:20,019 --> 00:22:21,884
- Sid.
- Just two minutes.

350
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,387
I am very sleepy.

351
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:26,821
Go ahead. Save them.

352
00:22:26,859 --> 00:22:29,851
Or they'll get bored
and watch TV instead.

353
00:22:50,983 --> 00:22:52,473
Hello

354
00:22:53,419 --> 00:22:54,579
Hello

355
00:23:03,662 --> 00:23:05,493
I know you can hear me.

356
00:23:06,598 --> 00:23:08,031
Talk to me please.

357
00:23:13,372 --> 00:23:14,737
You are not alone.

358
00:23:15,607 --> 00:23:18,371
I am here for you. We Care.

359
00:23:18,444 --> 00:23:19,877
Nobody cares.

360
00:23:20,779 --> 00:23:22,679
I care. Talk to me.

361
00:23:22,748 --> 00:23:24,511
No.. No.

362
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:26,313
Its ok. Its ok.

363
00:23:27,052 --> 00:23:28,451
Don't talk.

364
00:23:28,921 --> 00:23:30,650
No need to say anything.

365
00:23:31,757 --> 00:23:35,386
Its up to you.
Talk.. Or stay silent.

366
00:23:36,028 --> 00:23:40,488
But don't disconnect.
Just stay with me.

367
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,662
Ok?

368
00:23:45,404 --> 00:23:46,496
Hmmm.

369
00:24:02,554 --> 00:24:03,714
Hey.

370
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:05,889
Are you there?

371
00:24:08,026 --> 00:24:09,425
Hmmm.

372
00:24:30,816 --> 00:24:34,274
Hey. You are still there, right?

373
00:24:34,586 --> 00:24:35,814
Ya

374
00:25:21,333 --> 00:25:22,425
Hello?

375
00:25:22,634 --> 00:25:23,692
Hey.

376
00:25:23,769 --> 00:25:24,929
Are you ok?

377
00:25:25,704 --> 00:25:29,435
Oh my god. I am so sorry.
I am so sorry.

378
00:25:32,978 --> 00:25:34,809
Good morning to you too.

379
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:42,878
You didn't sleep at all last night?

380
00:25:42,955 --> 00:25:44,388
I swear Omar.

381
00:25:44,456 --> 00:25:47,619
I have never been so
scared with any other caller.

382
00:25:47,759 --> 00:25:50,319
Deep inside, they
wanted me to save them.

383
00:25:50,429 --> 00:25:53,489
But last night, I
was seriously scared.

384
00:25:54,633 --> 00:25:58,330
I never thought
I'll say this to you.

385
00:25:58,570 --> 00:26:00,299
I am proud of you.

386
00:26:00,839 --> 00:26:02,363
Was she cute?

387
00:26:03,775 --> 00:26:07,438
Very cute. I could totally
see her through the phone.

388
00:26:12,718 --> 00:26:15,380
Guys. This is really weird.

389
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:18,947
Last night a man killed
another man in the prison.

390
00:26:19,825 --> 00:26:20,917
So?

391
00:26:21,393 --> 00:26:24,328
Guess where he hid the
knife for four days?

392
00:26:33,405 --> 00:26:34,770
'Kaagaz ke Phool' book store

393
00:26:35,007 --> 00:26:36,736
Oh hello Krutika.

394
00:26:37,276 --> 00:26:38,538
How are you?

395
00:26:39,011 --> 00:26:41,707
Deepak Chopra? No?

396
00:26:41,947 --> 00:26:45,576
Hey. We are on for the
movie tonight right?

397
00:26:47,319 --> 00:26:48,479
Oh.

398
00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:52,848
I'll see you at home then.

399
00:26:52,925 --> 00:26:54,586
Ok bye.

400
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:04,326
So when are you telling
Kutti-ka that you don't love her.

401
00:27:04,503 --> 00:27:06,630
Her name is Krutika.
And don't start this now.

402
00:27:06,705 --> 00:27:08,969
Too late. When?

403
00:27:10,876 --> 00:27:11,934
Never.

404
00:27:12,311 --> 00:27:14,871
Because I do love her.

405
00:27:15,347 --> 00:27:16,405
Sid. We've gotjust one life.

406
00:27:16,481 --> 00:27:20,645
If you really want to save
a life, save yours.

407
00:27:20,719 --> 00:27:22,380
What's your issue with Krutika?

408
00:27:22,454 --> 00:27:24,752
Very simple. You don't love her.

409
00:27:28,827 --> 00:27:30,317
Then why am I with her?

410
00:27:30,395 --> 00:27:33,387
You really want to know?
You won't like the answer.

411
00:27:33,465 --> 00:27:36,628
Go on. I don't like
this conversation anyway.

412
00:27:37,369 --> 00:27:40,634
You don't stammer
when you are with her.

413
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:52,542
I don't stammer with her,
because I love her.

414
00:27:56,421 --> 00:27:57,683
Hey guys

415
00:27:58,657 --> 00:27:59,749
What do you think?

416
00:27:59,825 --> 00:28:01,918
Tonight, on the screen,
before the movie?

417
00:28:04,296 --> 00:28:05,627
We are going right?

418
00:28:06,264 --> 00:28:07,526
I am out.

419
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,765
Guys help!

420
00:28:11,003 --> 00:28:12,868
Aliya keeps
rejecting all my boyfriends.

421
00:28:12,938 --> 00:28:15,634
Uday, Aliya keeps
rejecting her own boyfriend.

422
00:28:15,707 --> 00:28:16,765
Where is she?

423
00:28:16,842 --> 00:28:19,276
- She went out to
meet you.. - Oh ok.

424
00:28:20,879 --> 00:28:21,971
Help me.

425
00:28:22,714 --> 00:28:25,444
- Guys.. coffee?
- I'll make it.

426
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:27,584
Or we could go out..

427
00:28:27,652 --> 00:28:29,643
.. for coffee.

428
00:28:29,788 --> 00:28:32,882
We could talk as well.

429
00:28:33,392 --> 00:28:37,556
Because you wanted coffee.. so..

430
00:28:40,866 --> 00:28:42,595
Or I'll just go make some.

431
00:28:42,934 --> 00:28:44,526
- Hey Amit.
- Yes?

432
00:28:44,770 --> 00:28:46,362
You've been working out?

433
00:28:56,815 --> 00:28:59,545
Would I buy wine if
I didn't love her?

434
00:29:00,318 --> 00:29:02,343
I love her. I love her.

435
00:29:02,554 --> 00:29:04,954
Would I buy such nice
bread if I didn't love her?

436
00:29:05,223 --> 00:29:06,349
Ok.

437
00:29:07,526 --> 00:29:09,619
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

438
00:29:13,598 --> 00:29:17,466
Would I light candles
if I didn't love her?

439
00:29:18,336 --> 00:29:20,827
Would I cook for her
if I didn't love her?

440
00:29:22,407 --> 00:29:23,704
Would I?

441
00:29:25,444 --> 00:29:27,571
No. No please.

442
00:29:28,613 --> 00:29:31,810
I hope no one tries to
commit suicide tonight.

443
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,646
Hello.

444
00:29:37,522 --> 00:29:40,548
Hi baby. Where are you?

445
00:29:44,996 --> 00:29:48,625
Oh ok. No problem. Go ahead.

446
00:29:50,368 --> 00:29:54,031
Its not like we were
planning a candle light dinner.

447
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:56,032
Bye.

448
00:30:31,877 --> 00:30:33,071
Hello

449
00:30:33,745 --> 00:30:34,973
DOST India?

450
00:30:36,448 --> 00:30:37,540
Yes

451
00:30:37,616 --> 00:30:39,982
Hi. I am Mishka.

452
00:30:40,519 --> 00:30:42,680
I talked to someone last night.

453
00:30:42,988 --> 00:30:45,582
Actually.. I didn't talk.

454
00:30:46,625 --> 00:30:47,990
All night.

455
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:50,021
It was me you didn't talk to.

456
00:30:50,562 --> 00:30:53,690
Oh. I am so sorry.

457
00:30:54,699 --> 00:30:56,690
I don't know what
happened to me last night.

458
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:59,328
- How are you feeling today?
- I am fine

459
00:30:59,604 --> 00:31:01,799
I just wanted to thank you.

460
00:31:01,873 --> 00:31:04,433
I hope you never need to
call us again.

461
00:31:04,476 --> 00:31:07,411
But still, please
take this number..

462
00:31:07,445 --> 00:31:11,575
No need. I am fine. Really.

463
00:31:12,651 --> 00:31:14,346
Wont trouble you again.

464
00:31:14,619 --> 00:31:15,813
Ok.

465
00:31:16,755 --> 00:31:18,052
Take care of yourself.

466
00:31:19,024 --> 00:31:20,719
Can I ask you one thing?

467
00:31:21,359 --> 00:31:23,589
Do a lot of people call you?

468
00:31:24,563 --> 00:31:26,758
- Yes.
- Why?

469
00:31:27,599 --> 00:31:29,931
Just to talk.

470
00:31:30,468 --> 00:31:32,561
But you are a stranger to them.

471
00:31:32,871 --> 00:31:36,363
- That's what makes it easy.
- I guess so

472
00:31:37,676 --> 00:31:41,578
I can hardly talk to
anyone since my mom died.

473
00:31:41,713 --> 00:31:42,907
Why?

474
00:31:43,582 --> 00:31:47,814
I hate to see people pity me.

475
00:31:48,353 --> 00:31:51,083
Then talk to me. An unknown friend.

476
00:31:51,423 --> 00:31:53,391
Nameless. Faceless.

477
00:31:53,525 --> 00:31:54,651
Just a voice on the phone.

478
00:31:54,726 --> 00:31:56,785
No.. I didn't mean to..

479
00:31:57,596 --> 00:32:00,326
I am fine.. Thank you.

480
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:18,438
My boyfriend left
me three months ago.

481
00:32:18,717 --> 00:32:20,309
He was cheating on me.

482
00:32:21,553 --> 00:32:23,350
I knew about it.

483
00:32:23,655 --> 00:32:26,488
But I stayed in denial and
kept believing his lies.

484
00:32:26,858 --> 00:32:28,485
I should've left him

485
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:30,651
Just couldn't gather the courage

486
00:32:33,798 --> 00:32:37,325
And then, one day he left.
Just like that.

487
00:32:44,576 --> 00:32:46,476
I am so sorry.

488
00:32:47,312 --> 00:32:48,540
Feel better?

489
00:32:48,747 --> 00:32:52,649
Yes. I am fine. Really.

490
00:33:05,363 --> 00:33:06,523
Ready?

491
00:33:08,333 --> 00:33:09,459
- Ready.
- Ya.

492
00:33:09,501 --> 00:33:11,901
- Will you focus on the game?
- I am focused.

493
00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:14,700
You get insecure if
no one wants to die.

494
00:33:15,974 --> 00:33:17,305
Aliya.

495
00:33:17,375 --> 00:33:20,367
Either marry him or kill him.

496
00:33:20,445 --> 00:33:21,776
Gosh!

497
00:33:30,689 --> 00:33:35,649
- Nick you idiot.
- Wait. Show me your eye.

498
00:33:35,727 --> 00:33:39,686
Let me see. Be
careful with the knife.

499
00:33:39,998 --> 00:33:42,660
Hi. Its Mishka.

500
00:33:42,701 --> 00:33:44,931
- Hello Hello
- Hi Mishka.

501
00:33:45,837 --> 00:33:47,668
- Can we talk?
- Of Course

502
00:33:47,739 --> 00:33:49,832
Hello Hello

503
00:33:52,043 --> 00:33:55,911
Someone wants to pour
his heart out to you

504
00:33:55,980 --> 00:34:00,076
In this beautiful dark night,
if only you listen.

505
00:34:00,318 --> 00:34:02,411
Hello Hello

506
00:34:03,254 --> 00:34:05,984
You are an artist? That's so cool.

507
00:34:06,024 --> 00:34:09,619
I was.. Now I work in a DVD store.

508
00:34:09,694 --> 00:34:10,956
Oh.

509
00:34:11,663 --> 00:34:12,755
That's also cool.

510
00:34:15,033 --> 00:34:17,729
I wasn't a very good artist anyway.

511
00:34:18,603 --> 00:34:20,264
Why the dark circles?

512
00:34:20,338 --> 00:34:21,896
Couldn't sleep last night.

513
00:34:22,841 --> 00:34:24,672
You're having sex?
- What?

514
00:34:24,876 --> 00:34:27,572
- Where did you meet him?
- We haven't met.

515
00:34:27,612 --> 00:34:30,979
- Cyber sex? - No.
Just on the phone.

516
00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:33,477
Phone sex.

517
00:34:34,586 --> 00:34:39,683
My life entangled in a
web of telephone wires.

518
00:34:40,792 --> 00:34:46,059
Someone please
free me and let me be.

519
00:34:46,865 --> 00:34:51,632
Let me go.. Hold me tight.

520
00:34:51,970 --> 00:34:56,566
Let me wander away.
Call out for me.

521
00:34:56,708 --> 00:34:59,404
Everything is under control.

522
00:34:59,611 --> 00:35:01,909
Everything will be fine.

523
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:06,781
Just let this lie pacify me for now.

524
00:35:09,354 --> 00:35:11,982
So you got a scholarship in Paris..

525
00:35:12,490 --> 00:35:13,855
Why didn't you go?

526
00:35:13,925 --> 00:35:18,658
Kabir promised he'd take me,
once he finished his book.

527
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:21,028
Uhhh.. Kabir?

528
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:24,733
My ex boyfriend.

529
00:35:24,903 --> 00:35:28,464
He never wrote his book,
I never saw Paris.

530
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:30,469
You really loved him a lot?

531
00:35:30,542 --> 00:35:31,975
I still do.

532
00:35:32,043 --> 00:35:37,709
The ticking clock taunts me
in this brooding darkness.

533
00:35:38,450 --> 00:35:43,649
The morning light awaits me,
if only I survive the night.

534
00:35:44,522 --> 00:35:49,289
Hear me out. Talk to me.

535
00:35:49,627 --> 00:35:53,893
Make these nights a
bit bearable for me.

536
00:35:54,432 --> 00:35:59,392
Let the early morning light..

537
00:35:59,437 --> 00:36:04,272
.. wash away my pain.

538
00:36:16,321 --> 00:36:18,585
No. I stay all alone.

539
00:36:19,691 --> 00:36:22,592
What about your parents?

540
00:36:24,329 --> 00:36:27,355
Dad fought with mom one
night and left the house..

541
00:36:27,432 --> 00:36:29,400
.. he never came back.

542
00:36:29,467 --> 00:36:30,661
Oh.

543
00:36:31,603 --> 00:36:34,731
And what about your mom?

544
00:36:35,006 --> 00:36:37,372
She waited for my dad for 10 years

545
00:36:37,675 --> 00:36:39,006
And then one day..

546
00:36:39,644 --> 00:36:42,636
''I can't take this anymore Mishka.''

547
00:36:42,981 --> 00:36:46,280
''I hope I can be a better
mother in the next life.''

548
00:36:49,621 --> 00:36:51,885
And you always keep
this letter with you?

549
00:36:51,956 --> 00:36:53,287
Yes.

550
00:36:53,791 --> 00:37:00,355
As a reminder that there is
always a way to end the pain.

551
00:37:00,932 --> 00:37:02,627
It's notjust the pain that ends..

552
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:06,397
Life, happiness, friends,
relationships..

553
00:37:06,471 --> 00:37:08,439
..Christmas, celebrations..

554
00:37:08,907 --> 00:37:12,468
All of them will be gone.
Everything will come to an end.

555
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:13,904
As if..

556
00:37:14,546 --> 00:37:15,740
.. lights off.

557
00:37:16,014 --> 00:37:17,413
Ok.

558
00:37:17,582 --> 00:37:19,709
- That's scary.
- Seriously.

559
00:37:19,951 --> 00:37:22,579
This life is all we have, isn't it?

560
00:37:22,654 --> 00:37:23,916
The next life?

561
00:37:25,857 --> 00:37:30,885
Has anyone reported back from
there? Maybe there is another life.

562
00:37:31,529 --> 00:37:33,019
But what if there isn't?

563
00:37:33,665 --> 00:37:35,292
Have you heard of Charvak?

564
00:37:35,433 --> 00:37:36,923
- Who?
- Charvak.

565
00:37:37,268 --> 00:37:39,395
Ancient Indian philosopher.

566
00:37:39,837 --> 00:37:42,431
He says that life begins with
the first breath..

567
00:37:42,507 --> 00:37:44,372
..and finishes with the last.

568
00:37:44,642 --> 00:37:46,974
Nothing exists
before or after this life.

569
00:37:47,612 --> 00:37:49,375
That's why I am telling you,

570
00:37:49,447 --> 00:37:51,938
Do what ever you
want to in this life.

571
00:37:52,283 --> 00:37:55,548
Live your life to the fullest.
Every moment. Every day.

572
00:37:56,688 --> 00:37:57,780
Do you?

573
00:37:57,855 --> 00:37:59,846
- Of course
- What do you do?

574
00:38:00,024 --> 00:38:01,855
What?
- What do you do?

575
00:38:01,926 --> 00:38:04,326
- When?
- Every moment. Every day.

576
00:38:04,362 --> 00:38:05,590
What do you do?

577
00:38:06,364 --> 00:38:07,956
I.. uhh..

578
00:38:09,667 --> 00:38:10,895
I..

579
00:38:12,303 --> 00:38:13,531
Everest?

580
00:38:13,671 --> 00:38:15,468
When did you climb
the Mount Everest?

581
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:17,005
After I quit NASA.

582
00:38:17,542 --> 00:38:18,873
NASA?

583
00:38:19,744 --> 00:38:21,575
I got bored of space travel.

584
00:38:22,413 --> 00:38:23,437
What else?

585
00:38:24,015 --> 00:38:25,880
Climbed Kanchenjunga, K2..

586
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:27,008
K2?

587
00:38:27,285 --> 00:38:30,345
No one has climbed K2 till date.
It's a virgin peak.

588
00:38:30,688 --> 00:38:31,882
It was.

589
00:38:32,256 --> 00:38:33,553
Not anymore.

590
00:38:33,858 --> 00:38:37,350
- What else do you do?
- Deep sea diving with sharks.

591
00:38:37,562 --> 00:38:40,463
North pole. South Pole.
And so forth.

592
00:38:40,498 --> 00:38:41,931
- Money?
- What?

593
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,433
Where do you get the
money to survive?

594
00:38:43,468 --> 00:38:45,629
Considering you've quit NASA.

595
00:38:45,703 --> 00:38:47,796
Money is not an issue.

596
00:38:47,872 --> 00:38:50,500
How? Did you rob the Swiss bank?

597
00:38:51,042 --> 00:38:52,373
Prize money.

598
00:38:52,443 --> 00:38:54,843
Prize money? What for?

599
00:38:55,647 --> 00:38:59,583
Last year I helped the cops
bust a drug lord in Nepal.

600
00:39:00,051 --> 00:39:01,450
Omar..

601
00:39:01,653 --> 00:39:03,211
It was a fluke.

602
00:39:11,663 --> 00:39:14,461
- Hey Mishka.
- Ankur. Hi.

603
00:39:14,532 --> 00:39:16,432
Wanna see my new tattoo?

604
00:39:17,402 --> 00:39:18,426
Sure.

605
00:39:21,305 --> 00:39:22,704
It's wicked right?

606
00:39:23,274 --> 00:39:25,333
Yes.. Wicked.

607
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:29,437
I am sick of your daily nonsense.
What the hell do you want?

608
00:39:36,621 --> 00:39:37,952
I should get going.

609
00:39:44,796 --> 00:39:46,491
A suicidal girl.. What's her name?

610
00:39:46,564 --> 00:39:47,622
Mishka.

611
00:39:47,699 --> 00:39:48,791
Right.

612
00:39:48,866 --> 00:39:51,767
Poor Mishka
considers you her friend.

613
00:39:51,869 --> 00:39:53,427
Trusts you.

614
00:39:53,671 --> 00:39:55,332
And you are constantly
lying to her.

615
00:39:55,807 --> 00:39:57,331
Am I lying for my benefit?

616
00:39:57,775 --> 00:39:59,333
Am I trying to woo her?

617
00:39:59,744 --> 00:40:00,938
Come on dude.

618
00:40:01,779 --> 00:40:04,771
I just want her to be
happy in life. That's it.

619
00:40:05,450 --> 00:40:06,940
As if I am ever going to meet her..

620
00:40:11,422 --> 00:40:12,480
Hi

621
00:40:12,557 --> 00:40:14,616
- Hi.
- Hello.

622
00:40:15,293 --> 00:40:16,760
I want to buy a book.

623
00:40:16,828 --> 00:40:18,693
That's what most
people come here for.

624
00:40:18,763 --> 00:40:20,458
But we sell pickles
as well. Try some?

625
00:40:20,531 --> 00:40:23,557
Ignore him. Which book?

626
00:40:23,768 --> 00:40:25,633
I don't know the name of the book.

627
00:40:25,703 --> 00:40:28,001
But its by Charvak.

628
00:40:28,072 --> 00:40:29,369
Char..

629
00:40:31,709 --> 00:40:32,903
Are you ok?

630
00:40:41,385 --> 00:40:42,443
Sorry.

631
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:44,511
He gets excited when
someone comes to buy a book.

632
00:40:46,023 --> 00:40:48,082
You wait. I'll get the book.

633
00:40:51,929 --> 00:40:53,362
Have you read it?

634
00:40:54,499 --> 00:40:58,333
No. Never. Not at all.

635
00:41:00,805 --> 00:41:02,602
Listen. Please watch out for the..

636
00:41:06,511 --> 00:41:08,809
Please.. watch out for..

637
00:41:22,727 --> 00:41:24,024
Is he ok?

638
00:41:24,295 --> 00:41:26,354
Ya. He is just allergic to pickles.

639
00:41:27,498 --> 00:41:29,728
Please leave your
contact information with us.

640
00:41:29,801 --> 00:41:31,701
We have a mailing list.

641
00:41:31,769 --> 00:41:33,600
If we get any new books

642
00:41:33,671 --> 00:41:35,434
- Or pickles.
- Yes.. or pickles.

643
00:41:35,506 --> 00:41:37,633
We'll inform you.

644
00:41:37,708 --> 00:41:39,403
Right.

645
00:41:39,877 --> 00:41:41,003
Your name?

646
00:41:41,779 --> 00:41:42,871
Mishka.

647
00:41:43,781 --> 00:41:44,873
Mishka?

648
00:41:44,949 --> 00:41:46,974
Ya. Why?

649
00:41:47,985 --> 00:41:49,953
It sounds a bit Russian, that's all.

650
00:41:51,689 --> 00:41:55,386
Could you also write
your address here please?

651
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:57,654
How much?

652
00:42:02,466 --> 00:42:04,559
- Oh my God!
- Exactly.

653
00:42:06,003 --> 00:42:07,265
Exactly!

654
00:42:07,338 --> 00:42:08,396
Exactly what?

655
00:42:08,506 --> 00:42:09,564
Mishka

656
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:10,766
Mishka

657
00:42:10,842 --> 00:42:12,605
This Mishka? So?

658
00:42:12,677 --> 00:42:14,440
So this is the same Mishka.

659
00:42:14,512 --> 00:42:15,843
Which Mishka?

660
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:18,348
The one for whom Sid
became James Bond.

661
00:42:21,919 --> 00:42:23,409
Now she'll find out..

662
00:42:23,487 --> 00:42:25,455
That I've never
climbed Mount Everest

663
00:42:25,523 --> 00:42:27,821
That I sell books and pickles.

664
00:42:27,892 --> 00:42:29,860
Relax Sid.

665
00:42:30,027 --> 00:42:31,892
As if you'll ever meet her again..

666
00:42:32,697 --> 00:42:36,565
Hi. Do you have
'Truth and Actuality'?

667
00:42:37,768 --> 00:42:38,860
Written by Krishnamurthy.

668
00:42:38,936 --> 00:42:40,631
Yes.. its..

669
00:42:40,905 --> 00:42:42,634
- Its out of shock.
- Shock.

670
00:42:42,707 --> 00:42:43,867
- Stock.
- Stock

671
00:42:43,941 --> 00:42:45,306
Its out of stock.

672
00:42:45,376 --> 00:42:46,638
We'll let you know when it arrives.

673
00:42:46,711 --> 00:42:47,939
We know your name now.

674
00:42:48,012 --> 00:42:49,309
Mishka.

675
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:50,574
Sounds a bit Russian.

676
00:42:58,823 --> 00:43:00,051
Gosh!

677
00:43:00,358 --> 00:43:01,950
You are not scared of sharks.

678
00:43:02,293 --> 00:43:04,352
Effortlessly climb mountains.

679
00:43:04,495 --> 00:43:06,759
And bust Drug mafia
as a weekend hobby.

680
00:43:06,864 --> 00:43:08,593
How come you are worried?

681
00:43:09,734 --> 00:43:10,962
She seems quite naive.

682
00:43:11,035 --> 00:43:12,366
Doesn't she ever get suspicious?

683
00:43:12,436 --> 00:43:13,494
Suspicious?

684
00:43:13,571 --> 00:43:15,436
How come you pick up
the phone every time?

685
00:43:15,506 --> 00:43:17,940
- As in? - Aren't there any
other helpline volunteers?

686
00:43:24,615 --> 00:43:26,810
Sid. The phone is ringing.

687
00:43:27,618 --> 00:43:28,676
You answer the call.

688
00:43:28,753 --> 00:43:32,553
- What? - Ya. Tell her
to try calling again.

689
00:43:32,623 --> 00:43:33,715
What if it's someone else?

690
00:43:33,791 --> 00:43:34,849
Then.. hh..

691
00:43:34,926 --> 00:43:36,689
Then just hand over
the phone to Sid

692
00:43:36,861 --> 00:43:38,488
Right. Rightjudgement.

693
00:43:38,562 --> 00:43:39,995
Please answer the call.

694
00:43:43,434 --> 00:43:45,629
DOST India. How can I help?

695
00:43:47,004 --> 00:43:49,666
Sorry dear, can't help you
if you don't know his name.

696
00:43:51,609 --> 00:43:54,806
Why don't you talk
to me? I can help you.

697
00:43:55,479 --> 00:43:56,810
What's your name?

698
00:43:57,615 --> 00:43:58,843
Mishka?

699
00:43:59,383 --> 00:44:00,941
Its such a pretty name.

700
00:44:01,619 --> 00:44:02,813
Is it Russian?

701
00:44:04,689 --> 00:44:06,884
Ok tell me. What's troubling you?

702
00:44:08,526 --> 00:44:10,551
Oh ok. Why don't you
try calling again?

703
00:44:10,628 --> 00:44:12,323
Maybe you'll get him on the line.

704
00:44:13,531 --> 00:44:15,021
You are so damn touchy Sid.

705
00:44:15,866 --> 00:44:18,426
Try that again and I'll
show you how touchy I can be.

706
00:44:18,636 --> 00:44:19,864
Bloody unwed mother.

707
00:44:20,004 --> 00:44:21,767
You rascal, that's my sister.

708
00:44:22,506 --> 00:44:24,531
At least stand up to
defend your sister you fool.

709
00:44:26,644 --> 00:44:28,976
Hello? Mishka? Its me.

710
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:32,679
I looked all over London,
but in vain.

711
00:44:32,917 --> 00:44:34,817
Finally found it
at a small bookshop.

712
00:44:35,386 --> 00:44:36,580
Found whom?

713
00:44:37,455 --> 00:44:38,888
Found Charvak's book.

714
00:44:39,657 --> 00:44:40,851
Oh.

715
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:42,849
Right. Charvak's book.

716
00:44:44,462 --> 00:44:46,521
I am sorry.. are you busy?

717
00:44:46,597 --> 00:44:48,292
No. Not at all.

718
00:44:48,566 --> 00:44:52,332
So what did you do today?

719
00:44:52,536 --> 00:44:53,662
Did you meet someone?

720
00:44:53,904 --> 00:44:55,030
Met whom?

721
00:44:55,373 --> 00:44:56,465
Anyone.

722
00:44:56,540 --> 00:44:58,508
Its good to meet new people.

723
00:44:58,676 --> 00:45:00,769
You know, interesting new people.

724
00:45:00,945 --> 00:45:03,971
So did you find
anyone interesting today?

725
00:45:05,282 --> 00:45:06,442
Not Really.

726
00:45:06,984 --> 00:45:08,246
No one?

727
00:45:08,652 --> 00:45:09,880
No one.

728
00:45:10,788 --> 00:45:12,722
In the train? The DVD store?

729
00:45:13,257 --> 00:45:14,485
In that bookshop?

730
00:45:14,558 --> 00:45:16,924
Oh that bookshop.

731
00:45:17,461 --> 00:45:18,655
What a weird place.

732
00:45:18,729 --> 00:45:20,993
It's run by three crazy Indians.

733
00:45:21,365 --> 00:45:22,423
Especially one of them..

734
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:25,469
who was hell bent on
destoying the whole shop.

735
00:45:26,904 --> 00:45:28,269
I am sure he was just nervous.

736
00:45:28,339 --> 00:45:29,397
Why?

737
00:45:29,473 --> 00:45:31,532
Because you are so beautiful.

738
00:45:32,643 --> 00:45:34,804
Yeah right. How do you know?

739
00:45:37,615 --> 00:45:38,809
From your beautiful voice

740
00:45:41,318 --> 00:45:44,344
Whenever I talk to you..
life seems to be good.

741
00:45:44,789 --> 00:45:47,952
Life aiways seems good
when you meke new friends.

742
00:45:48,025 --> 00:45:50,687
And I don't even know
this new friend's name.

743
00:45:50,761 --> 00:45:52,023
Si..

744
00:45:54,031 --> 00:45:56,522
Sorry. Rules are rules.

745
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:57,692
What rules?

746
00:45:57,768 --> 00:45:59,599
No name. No identity.

747
00:46:00,037 --> 00:46:01,504
Just a voice on the phone

748
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:04,230
Then what should I call you?

749
00:46:05,409 --> 00:46:06,501
Friend?

750
00:46:07,344 --> 00:46:08,675
But that's what everyone calls you.

751
00:46:09,013 --> 00:46:10,571
Then why don't you choose a name.

752
00:46:11,015 --> 00:46:12,312
Me?

753
00:46:12,383 --> 00:46:15,375
Sure. Something
only you will call me.

754
00:46:16,687 --> 00:46:17,984
Ok.

755
00:46:21,459 --> 00:46:23,450
So from now on, you are 'Fidato'.

756
00:46:24,495 --> 00:46:25,757
What does that mean?

757
00:46:26,464 --> 00:46:28,489
I'll tell you when you meet me.

758
00:46:31,602 --> 00:46:33,593
Now its time for your homework

759
00:46:35,306 --> 00:46:36,500
Make a new friend.

760
00:46:36,574 --> 00:46:38,269
I don't know how to make friends.

761
00:46:38,342 --> 00:46:39,604
Then learn how to

762
00:46:40,010 --> 00:46:42,877
By the time I learn,
Kabir will come back

763
00:46:44,648 --> 00:46:45,808
What if he doesn't?

764
00:46:52,756 --> 00:46:55,884
Don't say that Fidato. I'll die.

765
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:57,291
Mishka.

766
00:46:57,862 --> 00:46:59,557
I know. I am sorry.

767
00:47:00,297 --> 00:47:03,664
But what do I do when I
suddenly remember him.

768
00:47:04,568 --> 00:47:07,969
I can't think of anything else.
I can't even breathe.

769
00:47:09,340 --> 00:47:11,365
You tell me what should
I do when that happens.

770
00:47:14,712 --> 00:47:15,838
Dance!

771
00:47:16,247 --> 00:47:17,339
What?

772
00:47:17,414 --> 00:47:18,972
Ya. Just dance.

773
00:47:19,550 --> 00:47:21,381
When you are sad.. Dance.

774
00:47:21,452 --> 00:47:23,317
Feel bad about something.. Dance.

775
00:47:24,555 --> 00:47:25,647
Music?

776
00:47:25,723 --> 00:47:28,920
Music.. it's in your heart Mishka.

777
00:47:28,993 --> 00:47:31,587
Just listen to it and dance.

778
00:48:20,544 --> 00:48:25,379
I talked to a stranger last night.

779
00:48:25,449 --> 00:48:30,352
Poured my heart to a
stranger all night.

780
00:48:31,622 --> 00:48:34,887
I am not quite sure what he said..

781
00:48:34,959 --> 00:48:42,730
But he filled my soul with a song.

782
00:48:43,467 --> 00:48:48,734
Pam Pam Para Para
Pa ra ra Pam Para.

783
00:49:27,344 --> 00:49:29,869
Who is holding you back?

784
00:49:29,947 --> 00:49:32,643
You are the one stopping yourself.

785
00:49:32,716 --> 00:49:36,675
The world is
carefree in its own song.

786
00:49:38,355 --> 00:49:39,879
Just open your eyes..

787
00:49:39,957 --> 00:49:43,688
.. look for the one meant for you.

788
00:49:43,761 --> 00:49:47,697
Who would sing along
your song with you.

789
00:50:22,499 --> 00:50:25,297
As you shield your
eyes from sunshine,

790
00:50:25,369 --> 00:50:27,860
As you open your
umbrella in the rains.

791
00:50:27,938 --> 00:50:31,931
Hear the wind sing along 'Pam Para'

792
00:50:33,477 --> 00:50:36,071
Break away all the chains

793
00:50:36,347 --> 00:50:38,907
Open the window of your heart

794
00:50:38,982 --> 00:50:43,316
And hear the sky
sing along 'Pam Para'

795
00:51:19,056 --> 00:51:21,024
- Where is your iPod?
- iPod?

796
00:51:21,825 --> 00:51:24,350
You were dancing.
Where is the music?

797
00:51:24,428 --> 00:51:25,986
It's in here.

798
00:51:26,063 --> 00:51:27,394
You should try it too.

799
00:51:28,999 --> 00:51:31,934
If I dance to the music in here,
I'll get arrested.

800
00:51:33,871 --> 00:51:36,066
Hey. Did you get to know his name?

801
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:39,702
Not yet. But I call him 'Fidato'

802
00:51:40,077 --> 00:51:41,442
Awww.

803
00:51:41,945 --> 00:51:43,412
Does he know what it means?

804
00:51:44,548 --> 00:51:45,708
When will you meet him?

805
00:51:47,818 --> 00:51:49,547
Never.. I guess.

806
00:52:32,463 --> 00:52:33,725
Hi

807
00:52:34,364 --> 00:52:35,422
Hi

808
00:52:35,499 --> 00:52:36,557
Remember me?

809
00:52:36,834 --> 00:52:37,926
No

810
00:52:38,001 --> 00:52:39,832
I came to your bookshop yesterday.

811
00:52:39,903 --> 00:52:41,461
To buy Charvak's book.

812
00:52:41,638 --> 00:52:42,935
Really?

813
00:52:43,340 --> 00:52:45,501
I am sorry I don't remember.

814
00:52:45,742 --> 00:52:46,868
Oh

815
00:52:51,482 --> 00:52:52,608
How can I help you?

816
00:52:52,683 --> 00:52:54,014
I want these..

817
00:52:56,420 --> 00:52:57,910
Yikes!

818
00:53:03,827 --> 00:53:04,885
Sorry..

819
00:53:05,929 --> 00:53:07,021
Coffee?

820
00:53:07,364 --> 00:53:08,422
Huh!

821
00:53:08,499 --> 00:53:09,625
Coffee?

822
00:53:10,567 --> 00:53:12,865
Would you like to.. go?

823
00:53:14,705 --> 00:53:18,607
Oh. I don't drink coffee.

824
00:53:19,676 --> 00:53:21,576
Don't worry. Maybe later.

825
00:53:31,955 --> 00:53:34,822
Your homework. Make a new friend.

826
00:53:40,364 --> 00:53:41,422
Listen.

827
00:53:44,768 --> 00:53:46,963
Are you sure you
don't remember me at all.

828
00:53:47,771 --> 00:53:48,965
No.

829
00:53:49,039 --> 00:53:50,370
Oh.

830
00:53:52,876 --> 00:53:53,968
A bit

831
00:54:11,528 --> 00:54:12,722
Ok

832
00:54:13,964 --> 00:54:15,659
I don't really watch those movies.

833
00:54:15,732 --> 00:54:16,790
Movies?

834
00:54:16,867 --> 00:54:18,300
Oh.. Porn?

835
00:54:18,368 --> 00:54:21,030
Ya. Everyone looks the same naked.

836
00:54:21,438 --> 00:54:23,565
- What?
- I mean..

837
00:54:30,047 --> 00:54:32,572
We're lucky it was
cold coffee. Right?

838
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:37,480
Poor guy.

839
00:54:37,554 --> 00:54:38,646
Poor guy?

840
00:54:38,722 --> 00:54:40,815
I was the one soaked
in coffee.. Not him.

841
00:54:41,458 --> 00:54:42,789
Just give him one more chance.

842
00:54:42,859 --> 00:54:44,793
It's quite difficult
to find good friends.

843
00:54:45,495 --> 00:54:48,020
That's why I keep
insisting that you meet me.

844
00:54:50,467 --> 00:54:51,957
If you don't like him..

845
00:54:52,603 --> 00:54:53,968
.. what's the
guarantee you'll like me?

846
00:54:54,504 --> 00:54:55,630
As in?

847
00:54:55,706 --> 00:54:57,640
As in I am just a voice to you.

848
00:54:58,075 --> 00:55:00,373
Associate me with
any image you want.

849
00:55:00,844 --> 00:55:04,473
6 feet 2 inch.
Curly hair. Blue eyes.

850
00:55:04,848 --> 00:55:06,372
My underwear over my pants.

851
00:55:06,450 --> 00:55:07,542
What?

852
00:55:07,618 --> 00:55:09,313
Your phone superman!

853
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:13,318
Or maybe I am not even
as good as Clark Kent.

854
00:55:13,757 --> 00:55:17,488
And he just might be your superman.

855
00:55:18,462 --> 00:55:20,327
Siddharth? Superman?

856
00:55:20,464 --> 00:55:22,398
Why not? Just because he stammers?

857
00:55:22,466 --> 00:55:23,694
No.

858
00:55:31,608 --> 00:55:33,041
How do you know that?

859
00:55:34,878 --> 00:55:36,869
Charvak. That book.

860
00:55:37,014 --> 00:55:38,709
Its only available at
one store in London.

861
00:55:38,982 --> 00:55:40,506
You said so yourself.

862
00:55:42,486 --> 00:55:43,748
I've met him.

863
00:55:44,321 --> 00:55:45,845
I know he isn't very confident.

864
00:55:46,289 --> 00:55:47,756
.. but neither were you.

865
00:55:48,025 --> 00:55:50,459
How would've you felt if I
thought you were a depressed..

866
00:55:50,527 --> 00:55:52,290
..and sulking cry baby?

867
00:55:52,829 --> 00:55:55,627
Fine. I'll meet him.

868
00:56:10,747 --> 00:56:12,237
Hello.

869
00:56:12,282 --> 00:56:13,544
Uhh..

870
00:56:13,617 --> 00:56:14,777
Hi

871
00:56:18,722 --> 00:56:21,486
There is no one else in the store.

872
00:56:22,526 --> 00:56:23,925
I could be injurious
to your health.

873
00:56:23,994 --> 00:56:26,895
Even I am a bit
nervous around new people.

874
00:56:28,999 --> 00:56:30,432
- Siddharth..
- Sid.

875
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:32,525
You can call me Sid.

876
00:56:33,303 --> 00:56:34,930
I prefer Siddharth.

877
00:56:37,007 --> 00:56:40,602
Did anyone else buy
Charvak's book before me?

878
00:56:44,047 --> 00:56:46,481
Yes. A few months ago.

879
00:56:46,550 --> 00:56:48,017
Did you remember his name?

880
00:56:50,020 --> 00:56:51,282
No

881
00:56:51,822 --> 00:56:54,450
Do you remember
what he looked like?

882
00:56:58,428 --> 00:57:00,396
This is weird. I
don't remember at all.

883
00:57:00,464 --> 00:57:01,624
Oh

884
00:57:01,698 --> 00:57:03,632
Maybe he wasn't that special.

885
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:06,234
But he is. He is very special.

886
00:57:07,838 --> 00:57:09,635
Do you want any other book?

887
00:57:09,806 --> 00:57:11,296
No.

888
00:57:12,275 --> 00:57:13,708
Shall we try some coffee again?

889
00:57:16,379 --> 00:57:18,472
I have to look after the store.

890
00:57:18,615 --> 00:57:20,674
Oh it's ok.

891
00:57:20,984 --> 00:57:22,417
Dinner?

892
00:57:22,853 --> 00:57:24,548
Chinese?

893
00:57:27,457 --> 00:57:28,754
Ok.

894
00:57:29,226 --> 00:57:32,127
What? Ya.. Have an affair for sure.

895
00:57:32,295 --> 00:57:35,753
In about 6 months you'll
forget you even had a wife.

896
00:57:35,832 --> 00:57:37,800
And if you feel like
jumping out of your window again,

897
00:57:37,868 --> 00:57:41,964
Please call our new number..

898
00:57:42,472 --> 00:57:43,803
Ok. Bye.

899
00:57:43,974 --> 00:57:45,805
What kind of a
twisted person are you?

900
00:57:45,876 --> 00:57:48,640
Krutika has called me thrice. Why
aren't you answering your phone?

901
00:57:48,712 --> 00:57:50,441
Because Sundar wants to
commit suicide to..

902
00:57:50,514 --> 00:57:51,981
..teach his exwife a lesson.

903
00:57:52,482 --> 00:57:53,574
She is coming over.

904
00:57:53,650 --> 00:57:55,675
Who? Sundar's exwife?

905
00:57:55,952 --> 00:57:58,512
Krutika.
- Shit.

906
00:57:58,655 --> 00:58:00,054
Listen please just make an excuse.

907
00:58:00,290 --> 00:58:03,316
Just tell her.. Tell her anything.

908
00:58:03,393 --> 00:58:04,655
What should I tell her?

909
00:58:04,728 --> 00:58:06,787
- Take her out for dinner.
- What?

910
00:58:06,863 --> 00:58:08,956
Take her somewhere nice for food.

911
00:58:09,833 --> 00:58:11,926
Dinner with the evil queen Krutika?

912
00:58:12,002 --> 00:58:14,835
Please my brother. My friend.

913
00:58:14,905 --> 00:58:16,497
Ok. Ok. Ok.

914
00:58:16,573 --> 00:58:17,733
But this is wrong.

915
00:58:17,808 --> 00:58:18,866
I know.

916
00:58:18,942 --> 00:58:21,376
Also please tell Aliya not
to let anyone commit suicide.

917
00:58:21,444 --> 00:58:22,536
Ok. Bye.

918
00:58:35,826 --> 00:58:37,020
Hi.

919
00:58:37,494 --> 00:58:38,620
Hi

920
00:58:39,796 --> 00:58:40,922
You know what?

921
00:58:41,398 --> 00:58:44,458
Your specs made you
look like Clark Kent.

922
00:58:45,402 --> 00:58:46,562
Clark Kent?

923
00:58:47,671 --> 00:58:49,502
Oh. And now?

924
00:58:50,473 --> 00:58:51,940
Clark Kent without specs.

925
00:59:04,554 --> 00:59:05,953
So what would you like to eat?

926
00:59:10,527 --> 00:59:11,858
Sid told me that..

927
00:59:12,495 --> 00:59:14,861
I thought you didn't
speak to Sid all day.

928
00:59:15,799 --> 00:59:19,997
Not today. But whenever we talk he
says you and me should get along.

929
00:59:20,370 --> 00:59:21,962
Best friend. Girl Friend.

930
00:59:22,639 --> 00:59:24,368
That wont be necessary.

931
00:59:24,441 --> 00:59:26,773
Because I am going to
kill Sid today

932
00:59:26,910 --> 00:59:29,606
Then both of us will be free.

933
00:59:29,779 --> 00:59:33,715
Hallelujah. Here we are.

934
00:59:48,265 --> 00:59:49,664
Can I tell you something?

935
00:59:49,733 --> 00:59:52,031
For the first time ever
I am impressed with you.

936
00:59:52,302 --> 00:59:53,667
I love Chinese food.

937
00:59:53,737 --> 00:59:56,467
So do I. That's why
I've got you here.

938
01:00:00,977 --> 01:00:03,309
No No. I hate Chinese.
I hate Chinese food.

939
01:00:03,380 --> 01:00:06,315
We cant eat here. Lets go. Taxi.

940
01:00:06,383 --> 01:00:08,908
What the hell? I like Chinese food.

941
01:00:09,286 --> 01:00:12,312
No. Its horrible. They
cook everything in Ajinomoto.

942
01:00:12,389 --> 01:00:14,516
I don't care. I want to eat it.

943
01:00:14,991 --> 01:00:17,016
These Chinese
people eat weird stuff.

944
01:00:17,294 --> 01:00:18,727
Snakes. Rats. Insects. Yuck!

945
01:00:18,795 --> 01:00:21,764
I want to eat Chinese snakes.
Leave my hand.

946
01:00:21,998 --> 01:00:23,966
Trust me. I'll treat
you to mind blowing food.

947
01:00:24,034 --> 01:00:25,558
You'll be licking your fingers.

948
01:00:26,636 --> 01:00:27,694
Edgware road please.

949
01:00:27,771 --> 01:00:31,468
Edgware road. Here we go.

950
01:00:38,648 --> 01:00:40,445
Would you be ordering
for your main course sir?

951
01:00:45,855 --> 01:00:47,755
We'd like the Fa-f-f

952
01:00:47,824 --> 01:00:48,882
Fried rice?

953
01:00:48,959 --> 01:00:50,586
Will that be chicken or prawn?

954
01:00:50,994 --> 01:00:53,724
No. The fried ca-ca-ca

955
01:00:54,097 --> 01:00:55,496
Calamari?

956
01:00:57,534 --> 01:00:58,626
Corn curd.

957
01:00:58,702 --> 01:01:00,693
Oh. Fried corn curd.

958
01:01:02,772 --> 01:01:04,797
Will there be anything else, Sir?

959
01:01:09,412 --> 01:01:10,674
Why don't you decide?

960
01:01:10,747 --> 01:01:11,873
Oh would you want me to?

961
01:01:11,948 --> 01:01:13,313
Yes.

962
01:01:13,383 --> 01:01:15,647
Since you know what
we want more than us.

963
01:01:15,885 --> 01:01:17,375
Why don't you order for us?

964
01:01:17,454 --> 01:01:18,819
No mam. I was just..

965
01:01:18,855 --> 01:01:20,049
Stupid?

966
01:01:20,323 --> 01:01:21,813
What? No. I was ju-

967
01:01:21,891 --> 01:01:23,518
Jerk?
- I..

968
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:24,852
Ah.. Clown?

969
01:01:26,496 --> 01:01:28,430
Oh.. you are sorry.

970
01:01:28,665 --> 01:01:29,791
Don't worry about it.

971
01:01:29,866 --> 01:01:31,458
Just send us another waiter.

972
01:01:37,307 --> 01:01:38,501
Wow.

973
01:01:39,009 --> 01:01:40,340
I scolded him.

974
01:01:40,410 --> 01:01:41,672
I saw..

975
01:01:42,512 --> 01:01:44,377
- Thank you.
- No.

976
01:01:45,081 --> 01:01:46,946
Usually I scold people much later.

977
01:01:47,017 --> 01:01:48,348
In my head.

978
01:01:48,785 --> 01:01:50,878
I don't even do that anymore.

979
01:01:51,554 --> 01:01:52,680
Why?

980
01:01:52,989 --> 01:01:55,014
My stammer.

981
01:01:55,725 --> 01:01:56,885
What happened to your stammer?

982
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:58,484
Seems perfectly fine.

983
01:02:02,332 --> 01:02:04,800
I am sorry. It really
makes you that conscious?

984
01:02:05,735 --> 01:02:08,033
It's just a bit.. embarrassing.

985
01:02:09,906 --> 01:02:11,396
I think its cute.

986
01:02:13,009 --> 01:02:14,408
Really.

987
01:02:52,582 --> 01:02:53,947
Should we call for the cheque?

988
01:02:54,484 --> 01:02:55,746
Why? Are you bored?

989
01:02:56,019 --> 01:02:57,316
No..

990
01:02:59,589 --> 01:03:00,749
Its just that..

991
01:03:01,024 --> 01:03:02,992
I am not that good a
company these days.

992
01:03:05,762 --> 01:03:06,820
Oh.

993
01:03:07,997 --> 01:03:10,329
How long has it been
since your break up?

994
01:03:10,633 --> 01:03:11,691
Huh?

995
01:03:11,768 --> 01:03:16,296
There can only be one
reason for a beautiful girl..

996
01:03:16,639 --> 01:03:19,540
.. to forget that she is beautiful.

997
01:03:20,276 --> 01:03:21,743
A long relationship.

998
01:03:22,579 --> 01:03:23,807
Correct?

999
01:03:25,014 --> 01:03:27,380
Yes. But..

1000
01:03:27,450 --> 01:03:31,045
So how long has it been?
3 months? 4 months?

1001
01:03:32,455 --> 01:03:36,414
A friend must've advised
you to meet new people.

1002
01:03:36,626 --> 01:03:38,651
Go out of your house. You have to..

1003
01:03:38,728 --> 01:03:39,820
- Move on.
- Move on.

1004
01:03:39,896 --> 01:03:41,022
Ya..

1005
01:03:43,967 --> 01:03:45,366
Wow.

1006
01:03:47,837 --> 01:03:50,829
It's so easy for
people to say.. move on.

1007
01:03:52,008 --> 01:03:53,566
But it's not so easy.

1008
01:03:54,410 --> 01:03:55,468
What do you do when that person
comes to mind all of a sudden?

1009
01:03:55,545 --> 01:03:58,036
You can't think of anything else..

1010
01:03:58,414 --> 01:04:00,848
I know.. Do you also..

1011
01:04:04,621 --> 01:04:08,819
My girlfriend dumped me.

1012
01:04:09,325 --> 01:04:10,656
3 months ago.

1013
01:04:10,860 --> 01:04:12,327
Why?

1014
01:04:14,964 --> 01:04:16,955
For my best friend

1015
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:18,726
Oh.

1016
01:04:21,004 --> 01:04:22,266
I am so sorry.

1017
01:04:22,338 --> 01:04:24,704
Its ok.. Its ok.

1018
01:04:28,411 --> 01:04:31,812
When I saw you for the
first time I thought..

1019
01:04:31,881 --> 01:04:34,679
.. you'd be some kind of an artist.

1020
01:04:35,351 --> 01:04:41,381
Like a poet..
photographer.. painter.

1021
01:04:42,525 --> 01:04:43,617
Painter?

1022
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:44,954
I was a painter.

1023
01:04:45,028 --> 01:04:47,792
Was? You quit?

1024
01:04:48,731 --> 01:04:49,857
Had to let go of it.

1025
01:04:51,768 --> 01:04:53,395
Just grab it again then.

1026
01:04:55,438 --> 01:04:57,338
Hey. Paris!

1027
01:04:57,540 --> 01:04:59,064
Go to Paris for inspiration.

1028
01:04:59,342 --> 01:05:03,244
You know artists..
Museums.. Poets.. Photographers..

1029
01:05:07,784 --> 01:05:08,944
Sorry.

1030
01:05:09,819 --> 01:05:12,617
He promised to take
you to Paris. Right?

1031
01:05:14,023 --> 01:05:16,958
Ok. Now you are scaring me.

1032
01:05:17,427 --> 01:05:18,894
How do you know all of this?

1033
01:05:20,530 --> 01:05:21,622
Seriously. How?

1034
01:05:22,298 --> 01:05:24,528
Why should we cry?

1035
01:05:25,969 --> 01:05:28,597
Why should we cry?

1036
01:05:29,005 --> 01:05:31,030
Whatever may happen

1037
01:05:31,674 --> 01:05:34,643
Why should we be sad?

1038
01:05:48,591 --> 01:05:49,717
Cry cry..

1039
01:05:49,792 --> 01:05:52,727
Why do we cry so much?

1040
01:05:52,795 --> 01:05:55,286
What are we so scared of?

1041
01:05:55,331 --> 01:05:57,891
Why die so many deaths?

1042
01:05:58,301 --> 01:06:00,496
Why why.. Why this

1043
01:06:00,570 --> 01:06:02,367
Why that

1044
01:06:02,438 --> 01:06:04,702
Why wonder 'what if'?

1045
01:06:04,774 --> 01:06:07,709
What has to happen will happen.

1046
01:06:07,777 --> 01:06:10,268
Fly fly Baby lets fly

1047
01:06:10,346 --> 01:06:14,373
Lets head for the sky

1048
01:06:14,450 --> 01:06:17,317
And never look back

1049
01:06:17,453 --> 01:06:19,250
Why should we cry?

1050
01:06:19,322 --> 01:06:21,790
Why should we cry?

1051
01:06:22,325 --> 01:06:23,883
Whatever may happen

1052
01:06:23,960 --> 01:06:26,428
Why should we be sad?

1053
01:06:26,496 --> 01:06:31,559
Why should we
suffer sleepless nights?

1054
01:06:31,768 --> 01:06:32,962
Cry cry..

1055
01:06:33,036 --> 01:06:35,971
Why do we cry so much?

1056
01:06:36,039 --> 01:06:38,371
What are we so scared of?

1057
01:06:38,441 --> 01:06:41,342
Why die so many deaths

1058
01:07:00,697 --> 01:07:04,895
Four breaths, the story of life

1059
01:07:05,535 --> 01:07:10,302
How many wasted on sighs

1060
01:07:10,373 --> 01:07:12,534
One lost in childhood,

1061
01:07:12,675 --> 01:07:14,666
One wheezed in old-age

1062
01:07:15,011 --> 01:07:16,876
One's for an uncertain tomorrow

1063
01:07:16,946 --> 01:07:19,813
So what's this one worth?

1064
01:07:19,882 --> 01:07:21,543
Why should we cry?

1065
01:07:21,617 --> 01:07:24,518
Why should we cry?

1066
01:07:24,721 --> 01:07:26,416
Whatever may happen

1067
01:07:26,489 --> 01:07:28,855
Why should we be sad?

1068
01:07:28,925 --> 01:07:33,953
Why should we
suffer sleepless nights?

1069
01:07:58,388 --> 01:08:00,288
You sure sound

1070
01:08:00,656 --> 01:08:02,385
Like you're making sense

1071
01:08:02,959 --> 01:08:07,453
Why do we spend nights in tears

1072
01:08:07,630 --> 01:08:12,624
Lets kick away and forget our fears

1073
01:08:12,769 --> 01:08:17,502
Tell you what: if I ever
whine again, Whack me!

1074
01:08:17,573 --> 01:08:20,406
Or just help me forget my pain.

1075
01:08:20,476 --> 01:08:22,376
No No No No No No.

1076
01:08:22,445 --> 01:08:26,973
If you hear me crib

1077
01:08:27,250 --> 01:08:30,310
Just whack me again

1078
01:08:30,453 --> 01:08:31,784
No way.

1079
01:08:31,854 --> 01:08:33,685
Why should we cry?

1080
01:08:33,756 --> 01:08:36,418
Why should we cry?

1081
01:08:36,759 --> 01:08:38,590
Whatever may happen

1082
01:08:38,661 --> 01:08:40,959
Why should we be sad?

1083
01:08:41,330 --> 01:08:45,699
Why should we
suffer sleepless nights?

1084
01:08:46,335 --> 01:08:47,529
Cry cry..

1085
01:08:47,603 --> 01:08:50,572
Why do we cry so much?

1086
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:52,904
What are we so scared of?

1087
01:08:52,942 --> 01:08:55,536
Why die so many deaths?

1088
01:08:55,878 --> 01:08:58,278
Why why.. Why this

1089
01:08:58,347 --> 01:09:00,008
Why that

1090
01:09:00,283 --> 01:09:02,478
Why wonder 'what if'?

1091
01:09:02,552 --> 01:09:05,385
What has to happen will happen.

1092
01:09:05,488 --> 01:09:06,716
Fly fly

1093
01:09:06,789 --> 01:09:09,622
Baby lets fly

1094
01:09:09,692 --> 01:09:12,217
Lets head for the sky

1095
01:09:12,295 --> 01:09:14,695
And never look back

1096
01:09:22,872 --> 01:09:25,932
Cry Cry.. Cry Cry

1097
01:09:33,249 --> 01:09:35,877
Thank you Siddharth. I
had a really good time.

1098
01:09:36,519 --> 01:09:38,953
I didn't break or drop anything.

1099
01:09:39,021 --> 01:09:41,489
I know. Just like Superman.

1100
01:09:52,502 --> 01:09:53,560
Hey.

1101
01:09:53,636 --> 01:09:56,400
Turn it off. Its m-m-midnight

1102
01:09:56,706 --> 01:09:59,436
And what if I d-d-d-don't?

1103
01:09:59,775 --> 01:10:00,867
Bloody mother f-f-f..

1104
01:10:00,943 --> 01:10:02,911
Siddharth. Forget it.

1105
01:10:02,979 --> 01:10:04,742
I'll just straighten him out.

1106
01:10:05,948 --> 01:10:08,348
Come here for a sec. Come.

1107
01:10:12,755 --> 01:10:14,416
- Tell me the truth.
- Huh?

1108
01:10:14,824 --> 01:10:16,314
You can fly, right?

1109
01:10:19,061 --> 01:10:20,460
Thank you Siddharth.

1110
01:10:28,504 --> 01:10:29,630
Bye.

1111
01:10:43,653 --> 01:10:45,348
You look good without your specs.

1112
01:10:49,325 --> 01:10:51,020
- No. Krutika don't.
- Hello.

1113
01:10:51,527 --> 01:10:52,721
What sweety?

1114
01:10:53,029 --> 01:10:54,894
I don't know who you
are talking about.

1115
01:10:55,331 --> 01:10:56,593
Try again.

1116
01:10:58,401 --> 01:10:59,800
You have a fan Sid.

1117
01:10:59,969 --> 01:11:01,630
She only wants to talk to you.

1118
01:11:02,805 --> 01:11:05,535
Krutika.. Krutika please.

1119
01:11:06,409 --> 01:11:07,535
Krutika.

1120
01:11:07,610 --> 01:11:09,271
Just listen to me

1121
01:11:12,348 --> 01:11:13,872
I saw you with Mishka.

1122
01:11:16,586 --> 01:11:17,883
Krutika didn't see it.

1123
01:11:20,723 --> 01:11:22,054
What are you doing Sid?

1124
01:11:24,627 --> 01:11:25,753
I love her Omar.

1125
01:11:25,828 --> 01:11:26,988
Don't talk rubbish.

1126
01:11:27,430 --> 01:11:29,421
If you loved her you
wouldn't humiliate her like..

1127
01:11:34,070 --> 01:11:35,401
Oh God!

1128
01:11:36,872 --> 01:11:37,964
Mishka?

1129
01:11:43,879 --> 01:11:45,312
Do you have beer?

1130
01:11:45,481 --> 01:11:48,917
- She is depressed Omar.
- Then help her as Siddharth.

1131
01:11:49,485 --> 01:11:50,884
Why do you need to be 'Fidato'?

1132
01:11:50,953 --> 01:11:53,421
Because she isn't as
close to Siddharth right now

1133
01:11:54,590 --> 01:11:56,683
So you want to
manipulate her as Fidato..

1134
01:11:57,560 --> 01:11:59,653
.. until she falls for Siddharth?

1135
01:12:00,396 --> 01:12:01,624
Its not like that Omar.

1136
01:12:03,299 --> 01:12:06,462
Fine. Then tell her
that you are Fidato

1137
01:12:08,838 --> 01:12:10,499
- I can't..
- Can't tell her?

1138
01:12:11,674 --> 01:12:12,868
Fine.

1139
01:12:13,342 --> 01:12:15,708
Then tell her you are
quitting the helpline and leaving.

1140
01:12:18,347 --> 01:12:19,507
Where to?

1141
01:12:20,049 --> 01:12:22,449
To the moon. Or South Pole.

1142
01:12:22,518 --> 01:12:23,746
How does it matter?

1143
01:12:25,388 --> 01:12:26,719
And when will I be back?

1144
01:12:27,490 --> 01:12:29,958
Sid.. Never.

1145
01:12:36,332 --> 01:12:37,458
You're right.

1146
01:12:39,001 --> 01:12:40,298
I'll say it.

1147
01:12:41,070 --> 01:12:42,765
You go home and sleep.

1148
01:12:45,441 --> 01:12:46,499
What?

1149
01:12:47,743 --> 01:12:49,074
I know you won't do it Sid.

1150
01:12:51,347 --> 01:12:53,611
I don't want to lose her Omar.

1151
01:12:57,820 --> 01:12:58,946
Fine.

1152
01:12:59,488 --> 01:13:00,580
I'll tell her.

1153
01:13:01,290 --> 01:13:02,382
What?

1154
01:13:02,558 --> 01:13:04,890
That you've left.. Forever.

1155
01:13:05,895 --> 01:13:09,592
After that no Fidato.
Only Siddharth.

1156
01:13:12,601 --> 01:13:13,898
And we leave the rest to God.

1157
01:13:48,445 --> 01:13:49,469
DOST India.

1158
01:13:51,048 --> 01:13:53,312
Yes.. Yes.

1159
01:13:55,319 --> 01:13:57,014
No.. No.

1160
01:13:59,523 --> 01:14:01,354
Why don't you try calling again?

1161
01:14:02,025 --> 01:14:03,253
I am sure he'll pick up the phone.

1162
01:14:12,436 --> 01:14:13,460
Hello

1163
01:14:14,538 --> 01:14:15,630
Mishka?

1164
01:14:16,940 --> 01:14:17,964
What happened?

1165
01:14:18,041 --> 01:14:19,133
Mishka calm down

1166
01:14:19,943 --> 01:14:21,638
What happened Mishka?

1167
01:14:22,446 --> 01:14:25,142
He sent back everything Fidato.

1168
01:14:25,983 --> 01:14:27,382
He has sent back everything.

1169
01:14:33,590 --> 01:14:35,319
Hi Mishka. This is Kabir.

1170
01:14:35,993 --> 01:14:39,190
I have left some old photographs
and letters in your mailbox.

1171
01:14:41,131 --> 01:14:42,530
I hope you got them.

1172
01:14:44,301 --> 01:14:47,532
Bhavna doesn't want me
to have anything of yours.

1173
01:14:48,538 --> 01:14:53,407
I think she is being silly.
But I guess I need to do this.

1174
01:14:53,643 --> 01:14:56,635
Anyway. Take care of yourself.

1175
01:14:57,514 --> 01:15:00,972
He is never coming back Fidato.
He is never coming back.

1176
01:15:02,119 --> 01:15:03,245
Good.

1177
01:15:03,553 --> 01:15:05,578
At least you wont waste
your life waiting for him.

1178
01:15:06,089 --> 01:15:07,681
He is my life Fidato.

1179
01:15:07,958 --> 01:15:11,121
He was just one part of
your life that is over.

1180
01:15:12,129 --> 01:15:15,064
Get rid of everything
that reminds you of him.

1181
01:15:16,099 --> 01:15:18,363
Burn it Mishka. Burn it all.

1182
01:15:33,984 --> 01:15:38,011
I think till the time
Mishka is so close to Fidato..

1183
01:15:38,088 --> 01:15:39,282
.. Siddharth has no chance.

1184
01:15:40,090 --> 01:15:43,423
So get closer to her as Siddharth
and let Fidato take a back seat.

1185
01:15:45,228 --> 01:15:46,286
So what exactly do I do?

1186
01:15:46,596 --> 01:15:49,963
Make her happy Sid. Or
should I call you Fid?

1187
01:15:52,102 --> 01:15:53,194
So where is Nick meeting us?

1188
01:15:53,503 --> 01:15:55,164
The new maternity store nearby

1189
01:15:56,073 --> 01:15:58,098
Can I ask you something?

1190
01:15:59,309 --> 01:16:00,901
Why am I not marrying Nick?

1191
01:16:02,913 --> 01:16:04,073
He is lying as well.

1192
01:16:04,214 --> 01:16:06,045
Nick? Lying to you?

1193
01:16:06,316 --> 01:16:07,476
Impossible.

1194
01:16:08,518 --> 01:16:09,610
When did I say he is lying to me?

1195
01:17:03,340 --> 01:17:08,505
Connected by one thread..

1196
01:17:08,578 --> 01:17:12,605
.. Two stories

1197
01:17:13,950 --> 01:17:18,887
Connected by one strand..

1198
01:17:18,955 --> 01:17:23,517
.. Two lives

1199
01:17:23,894 --> 01:17:30,094
On the phone someone laughs

1200
01:17:30,267 --> 01:17:36,263
A silent laugh from lonely places

1201
01:17:36,973 --> 01:17:42,206
One life, two faces

1202
01:17:42,279 --> 01:17:48,218
One life, two faces

1203
01:18:19,916 --> 01:18:27,186
Who graced my barren life

1204
01:18:27,857 --> 01:18:35,491
Like a light rain on dry earth

1205
01:18:35,565 --> 01:18:40,434
How I fear that someone may steal..

1206
01:18:40,503 --> 01:18:46,032
.. these stolen clouds from my sky

1207
01:18:46,109 --> 01:18:50,944
These stolen graces

1208
01:18:51,014 --> 01:18:56,611
One life and two faces

1209
01:19:23,213 --> 01:19:30,346
Was I meant to meet this angel?

1210
01:19:30,987 --> 01:19:38,621
Was I meant to share this bond?

1211
01:19:38,895 --> 01:19:43,992
The heavens seem divine again

1212
01:19:44,067 --> 01:19:49,266
Never return me, dear Lord..

1213
01:19:49,339 --> 01:19:54,276
.. to the darkness
that this glow replaces

1214
01:19:54,344 --> 01:19:59,509
One life, two faces

1215
01:19:59,582 --> 01:20:05,384
One life, two faces

1216
01:20:08,491 --> 01:20:14,896
One life, two faces

1217
01:20:53,636 --> 01:20:54,898
Hi Mishka

1218
01:20:56,106 --> 01:20:57,198
Hi Kabir

1219
01:20:58,074 --> 01:20:59,371
Oh.

1220
01:21:00,910 --> 01:21:02,207
Sketching again I see

1221
01:21:02,278 --> 01:21:03,506
Not really, just..

1222
01:21:04,147 --> 01:21:05,205
Hi Mishka

1223
01:21:05,482 --> 01:21:06,540
Bhavna.. Hi

1224
01:21:06,883 --> 01:21:07,975
How are you?

1225
01:21:08,618 --> 01:21:09,915
I am good.

1226
01:21:09,986 --> 01:21:11,044
This seems a bit dark.

1227
01:21:11,187 --> 01:21:13,348
Try painting. Something colourful.

1228
01:21:13,957 --> 01:21:15,618
But you were never
very good at painting.

1229
01:21:15,892 --> 01:21:17,416
That's why I kept
suggesting you go to Paris.

1230
01:21:18,828 --> 01:21:21,524
Here you go my love. Coffee.

1231
01:21:22,165 --> 01:21:23,257
Thanks.

1232
01:21:23,933 --> 01:21:25,298
Hi. I am Siddharth.

1233
01:21:26,002 --> 01:21:27,993
You must be K-Kabir.

1234
01:21:28,171 --> 01:21:29,934
Yes. K-Kabir.

1235
01:21:29,973 --> 01:21:31,998
I've heard a lot about you.

1236
01:21:33,543 --> 01:21:34,601
Anything good?

1237
01:21:34,878 --> 01:21:36,846
Maybe once.

1238
01:21:38,481 --> 01:21:41,245
- I'd like you to..
- Nice painting, right?

1239
01:21:42,118 --> 01:21:43,312
I'll buy it.

1240
01:21:43,953 --> 01:21:45,045
It's a sketch.

1241
01:21:46,423 --> 01:21:47,617
It's called a sketch.

1242
01:21:50,059 --> 01:21:51,117
Nice sketch.

1243
01:21:51,194 --> 01:21:55,096
But I think these two
are ruining the balance.

1244
01:21:56,566 --> 01:21:58,261
Kabir. We're getting late.

1245
01:21:58,568 --> 01:21:59,899
Of course my darling

1246
01:22:01,137 --> 01:22:02,229
It was nice meeting you.

1247
01:22:03,373 --> 01:22:04,635
Bye Kabir.

1248
01:22:06,576 --> 01:22:07,907
Bye

1249
01:22:10,280 --> 01:22:13,249
I am sorry if I
pretended to be over friendly.

1250
01:22:15,251 --> 01:22:16,878
How did you know that was Kabir?

1251
01:22:17,554 --> 01:22:19,419
You face lost all its colour.

1252
01:22:19,956 --> 01:22:21,287
The way you were talking to him..

1253
01:22:22,459 --> 01:22:23,517
His name.

1254
01:22:24,527 --> 01:22:25,585
What?

1255
01:22:25,962 --> 01:22:28,021
I never told you his name.

1256
01:22:28,498 --> 01:22:30,398
You told me over
dinner the other night

1257
01:22:30,567 --> 01:22:31,932
Not his name

1258
01:22:32,168 --> 01:22:35,069
Of course you did.
How else would I know?

1259
01:22:35,505 --> 01:22:37,268
I remember you did.

1260
01:22:38,174 --> 01:22:39,471
I remember you did.

1261
01:22:45,915 --> 01:22:47,109
She never said his name.

1262
01:22:47,183 --> 01:22:48,275
Whose name?

1263
01:22:48,351 --> 01:22:49,443
Kabir's name.

1264
01:22:49,519 --> 01:22:50,611
To whom?

1265
01:22:50,887 --> 01:22:52,115
Oh come on Sushi.

1266
01:22:52,555 --> 01:22:55,115
Lets start from the beginning.

1267
01:22:55,625 --> 01:22:57,593
First, Siddharth tried
to get fresh with you.

1268
01:22:58,228 --> 01:22:59,286
Then?

1269
01:22:59,562 --> 01:23:02,929
This I said, Hi I am Siddharth.
You must be Kabir.

1270
01:23:04,267 --> 01:23:05,325
Kabir !

1271
01:23:05,502 --> 01:23:07,333
How do I know his name is Kabir?

1272
01:23:08,037 --> 01:23:09,197
She must have told you.

1273
01:23:09,639 --> 01:23:11,072
She did, but not to me.

1274
01:23:11,574 --> 01:23:12,871
To whom then?

1275
01:23:13,476 --> 01:23:15,273
How does Fidato figure in this?
- Think about it.

1276
01:23:15,512 --> 01:23:18,106
What do I love the
most about Siddharth?

1277
01:23:18,882 --> 01:23:20,975
I don't know. He is good in bed?

1278
01:23:22,652 --> 01:23:26,019
Oh wait. That he understands you.

1279
01:23:26,089 --> 01:23:27,147
Exactly!

1280
01:23:27,223 --> 01:23:30,158
My thoughts. My likes. My life.

1281
01:23:30,226 --> 01:23:31,454
She paints.

1282
01:23:31,528 --> 01:23:34,326
Long relationship
that ended 3 months ago.

1283
01:23:34,898 --> 01:23:36,092
Whom does she tell all of this?

1284
01:23:36,165 --> 01:23:37,393
Fidato.
- Yup.

1285
01:23:38,067 --> 01:23:40,262
So you think she has figured out..

1286
01:23:40,336 --> 01:23:42,031
.. that you and Fidato.

1287
01:23:42,105 --> 01:23:43,936
You mean Sid and Fidato..

1288
01:23:44,007 --> 01:23:45,065
Yes

1289
01:23:45,141 --> 01:23:46,301
.. are friends?

1290
01:23:46,576 --> 01:23:49,044
Oh. I never thought of that.

1291
01:23:49,212 --> 01:23:51,407
- What did you think?
- That they are the same person

1292
01:23:51,614 --> 01:23:53,445
Siddharth is Fidato.

1293
01:23:54,551 --> 01:23:56,212
Oh do me gently God.

1294
01:23:57,687 --> 01:23:59,052
Sure?

1295
01:23:59,389 --> 01:24:00,651
No

1296
01:24:03,693 --> 01:24:05,024
- DOST India.
- DOST India.

1297
01:24:05,495 --> 01:24:06,689
Lets go.

1298
01:24:09,699 --> 01:24:11,394
- Nick you bloody dog.
- You bloody idiot.

1299
01:24:14,571 --> 01:24:16,937
- DOST India. Got it?
- Yes.

1300
01:24:17,106 --> 01:24:18,266
Jeans.

1301
01:24:19,509 --> 01:24:21,033
Come on lets go.

1302
01:24:22,145 --> 01:24:23,578
- Hurry up Mishka.
- Coming.

1303
01:24:24,113 --> 01:24:25,876
- Mishka! - I am coming.
I am coming.

1304
01:24:30,219 --> 01:24:31,481
- Shall we?
- Go Go Go.

1305
01:24:34,657 --> 01:24:35,919
Son of a bitch!

1306
01:24:35,992 --> 01:24:37,084
Thanks Mum.

1307
01:24:37,293 --> 01:24:38,555
Let it be Sushi.

1308
01:24:38,628 --> 01:24:40,528
Show me what you got.

1309
01:24:45,935 --> 01:24:49,530
Don't think like that.
All you need is..

1310
01:24:51,474 --> 01:24:52,998
Holy shit !

1311
01:24:53,443 --> 01:24:54,501
Suhana Malik?

1312
01:24:54,577 --> 01:24:56,943
Siddharth, What are you doing?

1313
01:24:57,280 --> 01:24:59,077
This could ruin our reputation.

1314
01:24:59,148 --> 01:25:00,547
DOST India could get banned.

1315
01:25:00,617 --> 01:25:02,915
Please Suhana. I love her.

1316
01:25:02,952 --> 01:25:05,944
She wanted to die a few days ago.

1317
01:25:06,022 --> 01:25:07,353
Now she wants to live.

1318
01:25:07,423 --> 01:25:09,687
I am sorry Siddharth. I can't lie.

1319
01:25:10,193 --> 01:25:11,626
Come on.

1320
01:25:11,995 --> 01:25:13,656
Sid lies all the time for you.

1321
01:25:13,930 --> 01:25:15,591
He keeps lying for you all night.

1322
01:25:16,032 --> 01:25:19,263
Please listen to me.
I wont hurt her.

1323
01:25:19,502 --> 01:25:20,628
I swear

1324
01:25:20,903 --> 01:25:21,995
I know but..

1325
01:25:22,071 --> 01:25:23,299
Please!

1326
01:25:23,973 --> 01:25:25,133
Sister..

1327
01:25:25,375 --> 01:25:31,177
A Pakistani brother is
requesting his Indian sister..

1328
01:25:32,415 --> 01:25:33,609
Is he serious?

1329
01:25:43,926 --> 01:25:45,018
Can you see him?

1330
01:25:45,428 --> 01:25:46,520
That doesn't seem to be him.

1331
01:25:47,030 --> 01:25:48,088
How about that one?

1332
01:25:48,164 --> 01:25:49,256
That's not Siddharth.

1333
01:25:49,666 --> 01:25:50,928
Hi

1334
01:25:51,100 --> 01:25:52,158
Oh hi.

1335
01:25:52,235 --> 01:25:53,429
Are you here to volunteer?

1336
01:25:54,270 --> 01:25:55,464
Oh. No.

1337
01:25:57,040 --> 01:25:58,507
I want to meet my counselor.

1338
01:25:58,975 --> 01:26:01,136
I am sorry. That wont be possible.

1339
01:26:01,577 --> 01:26:03,909
Please. I just need to see him once.

1340
01:26:03,980 --> 01:26:07,939
Sorry. We don't allow
personal interactions.

1341
01:26:11,254 --> 01:26:12,687
Can I get a paper and a pencil?

1342
01:26:19,095 --> 01:26:20,221
What is she writing?

1343
01:26:21,597 --> 01:26:24,088
I don't know. Want
me to check with ISI?

1344
01:26:27,904 --> 01:26:30,964
Just tell me if this guy works here.

1345
01:26:33,276 --> 01:26:35,176
No. He doesn't.

1346
01:26:37,914 --> 01:26:39,939
Thank you so much.

1347
01:26:45,488 --> 01:26:47,388
So you don't trust either of us?

1348
01:26:48,091 --> 01:26:49,285
I am sorry Fidato.

1349
01:26:49,892 --> 01:26:53,419
But I was very sure I
hadn't told him Kabir's name.

1350
01:26:53,496 --> 01:26:55,361
You could've just
asked me directly.

1351
01:26:55,932 --> 01:26:57,957
Whether I am Siddharth.
Or a friend of his.

1352
01:26:59,035 --> 01:27:00,366
I got scared Fidato.

1353
01:27:02,271 --> 01:27:06,230
When I had called you the
first time, I was really going to..

1354
01:27:08,678 --> 01:27:10,509
I didn't have a reason to live.

1355
01:27:12,081 --> 01:27:13,275
But now I do.

1356
01:27:13,916 --> 01:27:16,043
I have a friend like you.
I have Siddharth.

1357
01:27:17,053 --> 01:27:19,044
Imagine my fear.. What
if both of you were lying?

1358
01:27:20,523 --> 01:27:21,854
I would've just died of pain.

1359
01:27:29,332 --> 01:27:31,027
Have a lovely weekend. Bye.

1360
01:27:35,171 --> 01:27:37,503
English translation of Mirza Ghalib.

1361
01:27:37,907 --> 01:27:39,067
Hard bound edition.

1362
01:27:39,375 --> 01:27:40,501
50 Pounds.

1363
01:27:41,878 --> 01:27:46,474
The same book in paperback.
4 Pounds.

1364
01:27:47,049 --> 01:27:48,141
What are you doing?

1365
01:27:48,217 --> 01:27:49,309
What?

1366
01:27:49,385 --> 01:27:51,012
Why will anyone buy this..

1367
01:27:51,187 --> 01:27:53,212
.. when the cheaper
option is right next to it.

1368
01:27:55,191 --> 01:27:58,456
Talk to Sid. I had told
him you don't like honesty.

1369
01:28:01,197 --> 01:28:02,289
You bastard!

1370
01:28:02,365 --> 01:28:06,165
Why don't I honestly tell
your parents why you wont marry.

1371
01:28:07,003 --> 01:28:09,494
Then I'll honestly tell
Uday about your crush.

1372
01:28:10,239 --> 01:28:12,366
Then I should tell
Krutika about Mishka.

1373
01:28:13,075 --> 01:28:14,269
And then I should tell Mishka..

1374
01:28:15,444 --> 01:28:16,502
Tell Mishka what?

1375
01:28:17,947 --> 01:28:19,107
What?

1376
01:28:19,215 --> 01:28:20,409
Tell Mishka what?

1377
01:28:21,384 --> 01:28:26,253
I was just telling Amit that..
What was I saying?

1378
01:28:31,294 --> 01:28:33,057
I was busy reading.

1379
01:28:33,329 --> 01:28:34,489
Tell Mishka what?

1380
01:28:36,132 --> 01:28:38,464
Ah yes, Tell Mishka
about the new arrivals.

1381
01:28:38,868 --> 01:28:40,426
We have a mailing list you know.
Why hasn't she got it yet?

1382
01:28:40,570 --> 01:28:42,595
That's ok. I am here now.

1383
01:28:43,172 --> 01:28:44,264
Are you interested in poetry?

1384
01:28:44,340 --> 01:28:45,432
Not really.

1385
01:28:45,641 --> 01:28:47,233
Try it. Its Ghalib.

1386
01:28:47,610 --> 01:28:49,942
I used to laugh at
the state of my heart

1387
01:28:50,313 --> 01:28:51,644
Now I laugh at nothing

1388
01:28:52,481 --> 01:28:54,449
How will you show your face to God

1389
01:28:55,151 --> 01:28:56,618
You who feel shame for nothing

1390
01:28:57,320 --> 01:28:59,049
Brilliant!

1391
01:29:00,556 --> 01:29:02,251
Sounds nice. How much is it?

1392
01:29:03,626 --> 01:29:05,093
A dinner.

1393
01:29:06,128 --> 01:29:07,618
Did Nick come here?

1394
01:29:08,397 --> 01:29:09,557
Oh. Hello.

1395
01:29:09,632 --> 01:29:10,894
Hi.

1396
01:29:10,967 --> 01:29:13,060
Aliya. This is Mishka.

1397
01:29:13,502 --> 01:29:14,560
Mishka?

1398
01:29:15,071 --> 01:29:17,096
- Mishka from the..
- From the video store.

1399
01:29:17,874 --> 01:29:19,842
Right. From the video store.

1400
01:29:19,909 --> 01:29:22,878
Hello. Am I late?

1401
01:29:22,945 --> 01:29:24,207
Yes.

1402
01:29:24,547 --> 01:29:25,844
Hi.

1403
01:29:25,915 --> 01:29:27,348
Hi. I am Mishka.

1404
01:29:28,351 --> 01:29:30,342
Oh Mishka? From the..

1405
01:29:30,386 --> 01:29:32,251
Video store?

1406
01:29:32,421 --> 01:29:34,548
Oh yes. The video store.

1407
01:29:36,259 --> 01:29:37,920
Aliya, No lunch for me.

1408
01:29:38,261 --> 01:29:42,493
I just met the hottest, sexiest,
juiciest.. Hey pretty girl!

1409
01:29:42,565 --> 01:29:44,192
She is from the video store.

1410
01:29:44,934 --> 01:29:46,094
Ok

1411
01:29:46,168 --> 01:29:47,601
This is Mishka.

1412
01:29:48,471 --> 01:29:50,405
- From the video store.
- Ok.

1413
01:29:50,606 --> 01:29:52,506
Hi Mishka from the video store.

1414
01:29:52,875 --> 01:29:53,967
So where is your brother?

1415
01:29:57,179 --> 01:30:00,876
Why don't you invite
Mishka home for dinner?

1416
01:30:02,118 --> 01:30:03,517
What do you say?

1417
01:30:03,552 --> 01:30:04,610
Ok.

1418
01:30:04,887 --> 01:30:06,081
Tomorrow night?

1419
01:30:06,555 --> 01:30:07,647
Yeah sure

1420
01:30:08,124 --> 01:30:09,216
Krutika?

1421
01:30:09,659 --> 01:30:12,093
She wont be there tomorrow. Right?

1422
01:30:13,129 --> 01:30:14,357
Who is Krutika?

1423
01:30:14,397 --> 01:30:17,264
Krutika. My exgirlfriend.

1424
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,264
Oh the one who slept
with your best friend.

1425
01:30:20,336 --> 01:30:23,032
Who did what with whom?

1426
01:30:32,982 --> 01:30:34,176
Its ok Omar.

1427
01:30:34,917 --> 01:30:37,078
I know about you and Krutika.

1428
01:30:38,254 --> 01:30:39,619
You know?

1429
01:30:41,257 --> 01:30:44,158
Its ok. You are my friend.

1430
01:30:46,362 --> 01:30:47,886
Thanks Sid.

1431
01:30:52,601 --> 01:30:53,966
Lets meet tonight then.

1432
01:30:56,105 --> 01:30:57,163
I'd like to meet her.

1433
01:30:58,140 --> 01:30:59,471
Sure. Why not?

1434
01:30:59,542 --> 01:31:00,975
No way.

1435
01:31:01,043 --> 01:31:02,943
I'm not prepared to host tonight.

1436
01:31:03,012 --> 01:31:04,377
Right. Exactly.

1437
01:31:05,881 --> 01:31:07,542
You could meet her some other time.

1438
01:31:08,250 --> 01:31:09,308
Ok

1439
01:31:09,385 --> 01:31:10,545
Give me your phone number.

1440
01:31:10,619 --> 01:31:12,280
- What?
- Home telephone number

1441
01:31:13,155 --> 01:31:14,213
My number?

1442
01:31:14,290 --> 01:31:17,282
Sid doesn't talk to people on phone.

1443
01:31:17,960 --> 01:31:19,222
Because of his stammer.

1444
01:31:19,595 --> 01:31:21,825
Right. Because of my stammer.

1445
01:31:21,864 --> 01:31:23,354
We never call him.

1446
01:31:23,566 --> 01:31:25,227
He never answers my calls.

1447
01:31:25,401 --> 01:31:26,595
Do you even have a phone?

1448
01:31:26,869 --> 01:31:28,996
I answer all his calls.

1449
01:31:30,973 --> 01:31:33,237
Ok. I'll see you tomorrow then?

1450
01:31:33,976 --> 01:31:35,068
Sure.

1451
01:31:35,344 --> 01:31:36,436
Bye.

1452
01:31:36,846 --> 01:31:38,006
Bye

1453
01:31:52,361 --> 01:31:54,852
How many times have I told you?

1454
01:31:54,930 --> 01:31:56,363
No matter what.. never
ever call Siddharth.

1455
01:31:58,901 --> 01:32:00,061
It was your mom again.

1456
01:32:01,904 --> 01:32:04,566
Cellphone. I have a cellphone.

1457
01:32:04,907 --> 01:32:06,875
You can text me.

1458
01:32:10,279 --> 01:32:13,214
Number? Amit. Number.

1459
01:32:14,950 --> 01:32:17,043
Thank you. Bye

1460
01:32:17,119 --> 01:32:18,177
Bye

1461
01:32:18,254 --> 01:32:19,380
Bye guys.

1462
01:32:31,100 --> 01:32:34,399
So when are you telling
Krutika that you don't love her.

1463
01:32:36,338 --> 01:32:37,896
Tomorrow. For sure.

1464
01:32:39,542 --> 01:32:42,409
And when are you telling
Mishka that you are Fidato.

1465
01:32:43,379 --> 01:32:45,370
Soon. Very soon.

1466
01:32:47,083 --> 01:32:48,880
You are dancing on top of a sword.

1467
01:32:50,186 --> 01:32:51,483
It'll hurt like hell when you fall.

1468
01:32:55,091 --> 01:32:57,218
So James. How did you meet Uday?

1469
01:32:57,293 --> 01:33:00,888
He was dancing. And I was watching.

1470
01:33:03,099 --> 01:33:04,157
Which night club?

1471
01:33:04,400 --> 01:33:07,233
A strip club.
I am an exotic dancer.

1472
01:33:08,938 --> 01:33:11,634
Aliya please.
Don't reject this one.

1473
01:33:12,007 --> 01:33:14,498
He is a stripper Uday.
What's wrong with you?

1474
01:33:14,877 --> 01:33:18,108
Didn't I approve Nick even
though he is a boring banker?

1475
01:33:19,181 --> 01:33:20,341
- What's that?
- Nothing sweety.

1476
01:33:20,416 --> 01:33:21,906
Just telling her you
dance like Shakira,

1477
01:33:27,156 --> 01:33:29,624
So.. Where did you guys meet?

1478
01:33:30,159 --> 01:33:31,888
- At the video store!
- At the video store!

1479
01:33:33,462 --> 01:33:35,657
Actually at the bookstore

1480
01:33:37,600 --> 01:33:39,033
He was dancing.

1481
01:33:40,236 --> 01:33:41,965
Whoa!
- Sid!

1482
01:33:42,037 --> 01:33:43,299
Sid was dancing?

1483
01:33:44,206 --> 01:33:45,366
And..

1484
01:33:46,442 --> 01:33:47,500
.. better than Shakira.

1485
01:33:50,212 --> 01:33:52,180
Surprise. My flight got cancelled.

1486
01:33:57,086 --> 01:34:00,578
Oh baby I am so happy
your flight got cancelled.

1487
01:34:01,390 --> 01:34:03,324
Enough with your sarcasm Omar

1488
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:12,092
Hi.

1489
01:34:12,301 --> 01:34:13,393
Hi.

1490
01:34:19,141 --> 01:34:20,199
Mishka.

1491
01:34:20,276 --> 01:34:21,368
Mishka?

1492
01:34:21,410 --> 01:34:23,275
Yeah. I met her at the video store.

1493
01:34:24,046 --> 01:34:25,980
And this is James. He dances naked.

1494
01:34:27,616 --> 01:34:29,948
And you are?

1495
01:34:31,453 --> 01:34:32,545
I am Krutika.

1496
01:34:33,355 --> 01:34:34,481
I am his girlfriend.

1497
01:34:36,559 --> 01:34:38,424
But I thought she
was his girlfriend.

1498
01:34:40,629 --> 01:34:42,119
They met at the video store.

1499
01:34:48,971 --> 01:34:50,199
I am sorry.

1500
01:34:51,006 --> 01:34:52,098
I should leave.

1501
01:35:01,383 --> 01:35:03,476
Shut up. Just shut up.

1502
01:35:03,552 --> 01:35:04,678
Krutika.. .

1503
01:35:09,325 --> 01:35:10,451
Damn.

1504
01:35:13,095 --> 01:35:14,289
Do you love me?

1505
01:35:16,932 --> 01:35:18,194
Did you ever love me?

1506
01:35:19,935 --> 01:35:21,027
Yes.

1507
01:35:21,070 --> 01:35:22,298
And now?

1508
01:35:26,342 --> 01:35:28,071
I love Mishka.

1509
01:35:29,044 --> 01:35:30,875
You bastard!

1510
01:35:35,451 --> 01:35:37,112
Did she hit you? She hit you right?

1511
01:35:38,621 --> 01:35:39,883
Wow.

1512
01:35:39,955 --> 01:35:42,924
Omar. Please go with her. Go. Go.

1513
01:35:46,562 --> 01:35:48,223
Mishka. Shit!

1514
01:35:48,530 --> 01:35:49,929
Nick. Keys.

1515
01:36:09,618 --> 01:36:11,108
Mishka please..

1516
01:36:11,186 --> 01:36:12,312
Hey..

1517
01:36:12,621 --> 01:36:14,020
You.

1518
01:36:15,157 --> 01:36:16,920
You got a problem? Come on.

1519
01:36:18,227 --> 01:36:20,491
Whoa. Easy mate. Sorry.

1520
01:36:22,097 --> 01:36:24,463
Mishka just listen to me please.

1521
01:36:25,167 --> 01:36:26,930
Is she your girlfriend?

1522
01:36:27,269 --> 01:36:28,361
No.

1523
01:36:28,404 --> 01:36:29,928
Siddhart.. the truth.

1524
01:36:30,306 --> 01:36:32,206
Ok. Not from the last 15 minutes.

1525
01:36:32,341 --> 01:36:33,399
That's it.

1526
01:36:33,475 --> 01:36:34,601
Mishka.

1527
01:36:38,013 --> 01:36:39,878
At least hear me out.

1528
01:36:40,215 --> 01:36:41,477
Bollocks.

1529
01:36:54,163 --> 01:36:58,566
I am sure he'll pick up the phone.

1530
01:37:03,172 --> 01:37:04,571
I love you sister.

1531
01:37:06,675 --> 01:37:08,199
Maybe he is
telling the truth Mishka.

1532
01:37:08,544 --> 01:37:11,206
Not every relationship ends well.

1533
01:37:11,413 --> 01:37:12,607
If he was telling the truth..

1534
01:37:12,681 --> 01:37:15,013
.. why didn't he break up with her?

1535
01:37:15,317 --> 01:37:16,375
I don't know.

1536
01:37:16,452 --> 01:37:20,115
Maybe he didn't have the
courage to tell the truth.

1537
01:37:20,856 --> 01:37:23,188
Maybe he wanted
Krutika to dump him..

1538
01:37:23,992 --> 01:37:25,391
.. to save her from heart break.

1539
01:37:26,028 --> 01:37:28,326
Or maybe he really is a bloody..

1540
01:37:29,932 --> 01:37:33,561
In that case, what am I doing
with that bloody.. whatever?

1541
01:37:34,870 --> 01:37:36,098
I am not sure.

1542
01:37:37,206 --> 01:37:39,572
But if you don't give
him another chance..

1543
01:37:40,609 --> 01:37:42,338
.. you will never
know for sure either.

1544
01:37:47,249 --> 01:37:50,013
Sid. So the silver lining here is..

1545
01:37:50,085 --> 01:37:52,246
.. you are just
lying to one girl now.

1546
01:37:59,328 --> 01:38:00,454
Where were you buddy?

1547
01:38:11,573 --> 01:38:12,972
Is Krutika ok?

1548
01:38:18,480 --> 01:38:19,572
Omar?

1549
01:38:20,549 --> 01:38:22,176
Uhhh.. Sid.

1550
01:38:25,220 --> 01:38:26,585
I think we should go to sleep.

1551
01:38:26,855 --> 01:38:28,288
Before its too late.

1552
01:38:28,424 --> 01:38:29,982
- Brother.
- Omar.

1553
01:38:30,426 --> 01:38:31,586
What happened?

1554
01:38:31,860 --> 01:38:33,020
Sid.

1555
01:38:34,229 --> 01:38:35,628
I screwed up

1556
01:38:37,866 --> 01:38:39,026
No.

1557
01:38:42,171 --> 01:38:43,570
Omar?

1558
01:38:44,139 --> 01:38:45,401
You..

1559
01:38:46,341 --> 01:38:47,569
And Krutika?

1560
01:38:47,643 --> 01:38:48,940
I am sorry.

1561
01:38:49,344 --> 01:38:50,538
Sorry?

1562
01:38:51,547 --> 01:38:53,412
You and Kru.. .

1563
01:38:55,083 --> 01:38:57,142
You and.. . Oh man!

1564
01:38:59,221 --> 01:39:00,381
You and..

1565
01:39:00,456 --> 01:39:03,391
She was crying. She
suggested we have a drink.

1566
01:39:03,592 --> 01:39:06,561
We just had one drink.
Followed by another. And..

1567
01:39:06,628 --> 01:39:08,653
- That's why you kept
asking me to leave her. - No.

1568
01:39:08,931 --> 01:39:11,525
- That's why you said
I don't love her. - No.

1569
01:39:11,600 --> 01:39:13,898
That's why you
called her a Kutti-ka.

1570
01:39:13,969 --> 01:39:15,231
No I meant it.

1571
01:39:15,471 --> 01:39:17,439
You've broken the
third rule of friendship.

1572
01:39:17,506 --> 01:39:19,371
Best friend's exgirlfriend.

1573
01:39:19,441 --> 01:39:20,999
What are the other two rules?

1574
01:39:21,076 --> 01:39:23,044
Best friend's wife and
best friend's sister.

1575
01:39:23,879 --> 01:39:26,040
- How would you feel
if Aliya and I.. - Hey!

1576
01:39:26,148 --> 01:39:28,082
- I would've understood.
- Bastard!

1577
01:39:28,116 --> 01:39:29,276
What the hell!

1578
01:39:29,518 --> 01:39:32,009
And you? How dare you?

1579
01:39:32,287 --> 01:39:34,551
Just because this idiot
slept with your girlfriend..

1580
01:39:34,890 --> 01:39:35,948
- Ex-girlfriend!
- Shut up!

1581
01:39:36,024 --> 01:39:39,255
Why should I suffer
for you being such a dog?

1582
01:39:39,461 --> 01:39:41,395
Now behave
yourselves and sort this out.

1583
01:39:41,563 --> 01:39:43,030
Do not get me mad.

1584
01:39:50,105 --> 01:39:51,197
Sid.

1585
01:40:06,955 --> 01:40:08,547
Guys. Hear this.

1586
01:40:08,624 --> 01:40:12,924
A pig's orgasm lasts
for over 30 minutes.

1587
01:40:13,495 --> 01:40:14,553
Do you think its true?

1588
01:40:14,997 --> 01:40:17,124
I don't know. Ask the pig.

1589
01:40:20,435 --> 01:40:22,130
Hi Mishka.
I was just telling them..

1590
01:40:22,204 --> 01:40:23,933
Amit.. later.

1591
01:40:25,974 --> 01:40:27,134
Time for a walk?

1592
01:40:32,381 --> 01:40:36,374
After dad left, my mom
promised she'll never leave me.

1593
01:40:37,219 --> 01:40:39,380
Then she committed suicide.

1594
01:40:40,856 --> 01:40:43,552
Kabir promised he'll
always be with me.

1595
01:40:45,994 --> 01:40:47,985
I've suffered enough heartache.

1596
01:40:49,264 --> 01:40:50,891
I cant handle more pain Siddharth.

1597
01:40:52,434 --> 01:40:55,892
I wont hurt you Mishka. Promise.

1598
01:41:05,347 --> 01:41:08,009
Thanks to all the pain
even I thought I would..

1599
01:41:10,252 --> 01:41:12,379
Don't worry. Not anymore.

1600
01:41:14,389 --> 01:41:16,550
I have realized what
mom did was wrong.

1601
01:41:17,993 --> 01:41:20,188
And I am finally
ready to forgive her.

1602
01:41:30,038 --> 01:41:31,130
Bye mom.

1603
01:41:33,942 --> 01:41:35,034
Bye Aunty.

1604
01:41:39,214 --> 01:41:40,272
So..

1605
01:41:40,349 --> 01:41:44,285
If you ever lie to me again,
or break my heart,

1606
01:41:44,419 --> 01:41:47,149
You and I will be on
opposite sides of the bridge.

1607
01:41:48,924 --> 01:41:50,050
Forever!

1608
01:41:52,628 --> 01:41:54,152
How is Krutika doing?

1609
01:41:55,297 --> 01:41:58,858
She is ok. Her and Omar..

1610
01:41:59,501 --> 01:42:01,162
That's it Siddharth. Dammit.

1611
01:42:01,370 --> 01:42:02,496
Seriously..

1612
01:42:02,571 --> 01:42:03,970
.. last night.

1613
01:42:08,977 --> 01:42:10,069
Really?

1614
01:42:13,382 --> 01:42:14,644
I am sorry.

1615
01:42:28,563 --> 01:42:29,996
Why aren't you ready yet?

1616
01:42:30,932 --> 01:42:32,024
I am ready.

1617
01:42:32,100 --> 01:42:33,499
Brother, would you just..

1618
01:42:40,542 --> 01:42:41,873
Gosh!

1619
01:42:42,044 --> 01:42:43,102
Sid.

1620
01:42:43,178 --> 01:42:46,113
Do I still have a chance with you?

1621
01:42:46,882 --> 01:42:48,042
Sorry sister.

1622
01:42:48,417 --> 01:42:50,442
I don't know Japanese.

1623
01:42:51,253 --> 01:42:52,914
How will I talk to your baby?

1624
01:43:05,200 --> 01:43:06,258
Hey

1625
01:43:06,868 --> 01:43:07,994
Hey

1626
01:43:09,237 --> 01:43:11,262
You forgot to wear trousers.

1627
01:43:14,009 --> 01:43:15,169
Sid.

1628
01:43:16,011 --> 01:43:17,273
I am sorry bro..

1629
01:43:17,345 --> 01:43:18,471
No.

1630
01:43:18,547 --> 01:43:20,105
You were right.

1631
01:43:21,983 --> 01:43:23,951
I did not love Krutika.

1632
01:43:25,387 --> 01:43:27,218
I love Mishka.

1633
01:43:28,223 --> 01:43:29,884
And she loves me.

1634
01:43:29,958 --> 01:43:32,893
She loves me. She
loves me. She loves me.

1635
01:43:33,528 --> 01:43:34,961
So you've told her everything?

1636
01:43:35,030 --> 01:43:36,122
Everything.

1637
01:43:36,164 --> 01:43:38,132
Except the fact that I am Fidato.

1638
01:43:38,633 --> 01:43:40,032
Sid!

1639
01:43:40,202 --> 01:43:42,329
When she calls me tonight..

1640
01:43:42,404 --> 01:43:45,066
.. I'll tell her that
we cant talk anymore.

1641
01:43:45,974 --> 01:43:47,100
I'll be done.

1642
01:43:47,309 --> 01:43:48,503
Goodbye Fidato.

1643
01:43:48,577 --> 01:43:49,942
Happy ending.

1644
01:43:50,112 --> 01:43:51,579
Now you cover your end.

1645
01:43:51,980 --> 01:43:53,072
What?

1646
01:43:53,148 --> 01:43:54,945
Wear your trousers.

1647
01:44:15,403 --> 01:44:16,927
Nick.

1648
01:44:17,072 --> 01:44:18,403
Nick stop it.

1649
01:44:18,473 --> 01:44:20,031
Will you marry me?

1650
01:44:20,108 --> 01:44:21,405
Just stop the music.

1651
01:44:21,476 --> 01:44:23,944
First say you'll marry me.

1652
01:44:24,312 --> 01:44:26,246
Only if you stop the music

1653
01:44:26,982 --> 01:44:30,247
Guys stop. Stop. Stop. Stop.

1654
01:44:31,620 --> 01:44:33,212
Why do you want to marry me?

1655
01:44:34,990 --> 01:44:36,218
Because..

1656
01:44:36,958 --> 01:44:39,222
You are the most
beautiful girl in the world.

1657
01:44:39,561 --> 01:44:42,394
You are gentle,
sensitive, intelligent.

1658
01:44:42,531 --> 01:44:45,193
You'll make the best wife..
a great mother.

1659
01:44:46,434 --> 01:44:47,662
Then why you?

1660
01:44:49,304 --> 01:44:50,362
What?

1661
01:44:50,438 --> 01:44:53,100
If I am so perfect,
Why should I marry you?

1662
01:45:12,961 --> 01:45:14,394
- Hi
- Hi

1663
01:45:18,466 --> 01:45:20,866
You are looking very pretty.

1664
01:45:21,069 --> 01:45:22,161
Really?

1665
01:45:23,238 --> 01:45:24,330
Thanks.

1666
01:45:25,173 --> 01:45:27,073
Hi. Hello.
- Hi.

1667
01:45:28,043 --> 01:45:30,443
Guys I am so sorry for
leaving so abruptly last night.

1668
01:45:30,512 --> 01:45:33,447
It wasn't your fault.
Kutti-ka shouldn't have come.

1669
01:45:33,515 --> 01:45:35,244
Her name is Krutika. Kru..

1670
01:45:35,283 --> 01:45:36,341
Brother!

1671
01:45:37,986 --> 01:45:41,422
We are sorry Mishka.
We all lied to you..

1672
01:45:42,324 --> 01:45:43,882
.. about Krutika.

1673
01:45:43,959 --> 01:45:45,017
I know.

1674
01:45:45,293 --> 01:45:46,521
But enough now.

1675
01:45:47,028 --> 01:45:50,327
I hardly have any friends.
And I really like you guys.

1676
01:45:51,399 --> 01:45:53,663
So no more lies. Ok?

1677
01:45:53,902 --> 01:45:55,130
You know I am gay right?

1678
01:45:55,203 --> 01:45:56,329
Yes.

1679
01:45:56,404 --> 01:45:58,372
No seriously.

1680
01:45:59,641 --> 01:46:03,099
From now onwards, none
of us will lie to you.

1681
01:46:03,645 --> 01:46:04,976
That's a Pakistani promise to you.

1682
01:46:05,313 --> 01:46:06,439
Right Sid?

1683
01:46:08,516 --> 01:46:10,347
I am not from Pakistan.

1684
01:46:11,953 --> 01:46:13,477
Ok guys. Champagne.

1685
01:46:13,555 --> 01:46:15,079
Yes.

1686
01:46:17,058 --> 01:46:18,252
Here's to..

1687
01:46:18,894 --> 01:46:20,122
What's the occasion?

1688
01:46:21,129 --> 01:46:22,892
I've got admission in Art School.

1689
01:46:22,964 --> 01:46:25,330
- Whoa !
- Nice.

1690
01:46:25,400 --> 01:46:26,458
In Paris.

1691
01:46:26,534 --> 01:46:29,435
Whoa. Oh?

1692
01:46:31,072 --> 01:46:33,131
So when are you leaving?

1693
01:46:34,009 --> 01:46:35,169
Leaving?

1694
01:46:35,911 --> 01:46:37,640
I thought you were
going to take me.

1695
01:46:42,217 --> 01:46:43,343
You will take me, right?

1696
01:46:46,321 --> 01:46:47,447
Here's to Paris.

1697
01:46:47,489 --> 01:46:49,047
Paris.

1698
01:46:49,457 --> 01:46:50,549
Paris.

1699
01:46:52,260 --> 01:46:53,921
Paris in summer.

1700
01:46:54,329 --> 01:46:55,421
Beautiful.

1701
01:46:55,597 --> 01:46:56,996
Congratulations Mishka.

1702
01:46:58,066 --> 01:46:59,124
Thank you Kabir.

1703
01:46:59,200 --> 01:47:00,258
You're welcome.

1704
01:47:00,402 --> 01:47:03,963
Didn't I tell you I could
never take her to Paris.

1705
01:47:04,339 --> 01:47:07,331
At least someone else will.

1706
01:47:07,575 --> 01:47:09,042
Its still Paris. Right?

1707
01:47:09,678 --> 01:47:12,010
Of course Kabir. Its still Paris.

1708
01:47:13,014 --> 01:47:16,973
Do email me and let me know
if Paris managed to make..

1709
01:47:17,052 --> 01:47:18,849
..an artist out of you.

1710
01:47:18,887 --> 01:47:21,253
At least she has
sold one sketch of hers.

1711
01:47:21,623 --> 01:47:23,318
What about your book?

1712
01:47:25,894 --> 01:47:27,259
You talk a lot about me, don't you?

1713
01:47:27,862 --> 01:47:29,090
I am quite flattered.

1714
01:47:30,065 --> 01:47:33,159
My book is getting
published next week.

1715
01:47:34,869 --> 01:47:35,995
Congratulations.

1716
01:47:36,071 --> 01:47:37,470
Thank you. They are in order.

1717
01:47:37,906 --> 01:47:39,396
And then, we are going to New York.

1718
01:47:40,375 --> 01:47:41,467
What?

1719
01:47:41,876 --> 01:47:43,070
Oh. Didn't I tell you?

1720
01:47:43,345 --> 01:47:45,575
You always wanted to
pursue modeling there.

1721
01:47:45,647 --> 01:47:49,640
And I can write anywhere,
so lets just go.

1722
01:47:55,557 --> 01:47:57,991
Oh please don't tell me
you are going to cry again.

1723
01:48:04,632 --> 01:48:06,122
Hey Mishka.

1724
01:48:08,670 --> 01:48:10,160
What happened?

1725
01:48:28,590 --> 01:48:30,956
The Cheeky One
steals something from me..

1726
01:48:31,026 --> 01:48:33,017
.. on the Jamuna banks, Oh Mother

1727
01:48:33,294 --> 01:48:37,390
My heart, my rest, my
peace of mind, Oh Mother

1728
01:48:37,465 --> 01:48:41,868
How can I go home,
having abandoned all shame

1729
01:48:41,903 --> 01:48:45,532
How do I go home and tell
them the prankster's name

1730
01:48:46,274 --> 01:48:50,472
Mother Yashoda on a
bridge across the Jamuna

1731
01:48:50,512 --> 01:48:55,575
A little thief stole
all the butter away

1732
01:48:56,985 --> 01:49:01,354
Mother Yashoda, how can I return?

1733
01:49:01,423 --> 01:49:06,554
A little thief stole
all the butter away

1734
01:49:07,662 --> 01:49:09,994
He bends my wrist
- Cheeky one!

1735
01:49:10,065 --> 01:49:12,090
But mends my heart.
- Cheeky one!

1736
01:49:12,167 --> 01:49:14,294
The vessel shatters.
- Cheeky one!

1737
01:49:14,369 --> 01:49:16,394
And I find myself free

1738
01:49:16,471 --> 01:49:20,498
He holds me by my hand and
takes me to yonder shore.

1739
01:49:20,575 --> 01:49:25,410
Mother Yashoda, I
swear I went up the bridge

1740
01:49:25,480 --> 01:49:29,610
To save the butter
from being lost forever!

1741
01:49:29,884 --> 01:49:34,218
Mother Yashoda on a
bridge across the Jamuna

1742
01:49:34,289 --> 01:49:39,192
A little thief stole
all the butter away

1743
01:50:03,885 --> 01:50:08,379
One day, as I
walked the Jamuna shore

1744
01:50:08,590 --> 01:50:12,651
I heard a young milkmaid cry

1745
01:50:12,927 --> 01:50:17,193
I wondered how I
could face you, Mother

1746
01:50:17,265 --> 01:50:21,463
If I didn't console the poor girl

1747
01:50:22,070 --> 01:50:24,129
Yes it's true I
stole a little butter

1748
01:50:24,205 --> 01:50:26,332
But taught her to as well

1749
01:50:26,407 --> 01:50:29,899
So Mother, we hid
on the Jamuna banks

1750
01:50:30,445 --> 01:50:41,185
And finished it off together

1751
01:50:41,956 --> 01:50:46,222
Mother Yashoda on a
bridge across the Jamuna

1752
01:50:46,294 --> 01:50:52,563
A little thief stole
all the butter away

1753
01:51:12,253 --> 01:51:16,952
Mother, I feel ashamed how I wept..

1754
01:51:17,025 --> 01:51:21,428
.. everytime the butter was stolen

1755
01:51:21,596 --> 01:51:25,498
Then your
prankster told me a secret.

1756
01:51:27,902 --> 01:51:32,498
Then your
prankster told me a secret.

1757
01:51:32,574 --> 01:51:37,034
Thieves only win
because you fear them so

1758
01:51:37,345 --> 01:51:39,438
If you eat to your contentment

1759
01:51:39,480 --> 01:51:41,573
Then what remains to steal?

1760
01:51:41,849 --> 01:51:45,410
So finish it, and share it, mother.

1761
01:51:45,486 --> 01:51:47,215
Mother!

1762
01:51:47,288 --> 01:51:50,621
On the bridge across
the Jamuna, it was I

1763
01:51:50,892 --> 01:51:52,587
That fed the
butter to the Cheeky One

1764
01:51:52,860 --> 01:51:55,090
And thus made all the butter mine

1765
01:51:55,129 --> 01:51:59,429
Mother Yashoda, I swear I went
up the bridge over the Jamuna

1766
01:51:59,500 --> 01:52:04,631
Not to steal, but to
feed butter to the damsel.

1767
01:52:04,906 --> 01:52:06,396
The Cheeky One
steals something from me

1768
01:52:06,474 --> 01:52:08,271
on the Jamuna banks, Oh Mother

1769
01:52:08,343 --> 01:52:12,541
My heart, my rest, my
peace of mind, Oh Mother

1770
01:52:12,614 --> 01:52:16,573
How can I go home,
having abandoned all shame

1771
01:52:16,651 --> 01:52:21,088
How do I go home and tell
them the prankster's name

1772
01:52:40,174 --> 01:52:41,402
Nick just stop it!

1773
01:52:44,245 --> 01:52:46,372
Do you have to ruin
every single moment?

1774
01:52:47,582 --> 01:52:50,176
Stop. I am not going to marry you.

1775
01:52:51,386 --> 01:52:52,512
Why?

1776
01:52:53,054 --> 01:52:54,146
Why not?

1777
01:52:55,990 --> 01:52:57,457
Because you are a fool Nick

1778
01:53:04,265 --> 01:53:05,596
Do you have to be so mean?

1779
01:53:06,134 --> 01:53:07,226
Mean?

1780
01:53:08,002 --> 01:53:10,163
I thought I was kind. Gentle.

1781
01:53:10,405 --> 01:53:12,270
- I was perfect.
- So did I.

1782
01:53:13,141 --> 01:53:14,233
But you know what?

1783
01:53:16,377 --> 01:53:21,337
You are a selfish,
arrogant, insensitive..

1784
01:53:24,352 --> 01:53:25,444
Go on.

1785
01:53:25,987 --> 01:53:27,045
Say it.

1786
01:53:30,258 --> 01:53:32,123
Stop lying to yourself Nick.

1787
01:53:32,960 --> 01:53:34,120
I am not perfect.

1788
01:53:35,263 --> 01:53:37,060
I get scared when
you say that I am.

1789
01:53:37,598 --> 01:53:38,963
And I am not pretty.

1790
01:53:39,367 --> 01:53:40,527
Stop saying that.

1791
01:53:41,302 --> 01:53:43,293
And I am definitely not gentle.

1792
01:53:44,272 --> 01:53:45,466
You're going to hate me.

1793
01:53:46,007 --> 01:53:47,907
You'll want to kill me.
Like right now.

1794
01:53:49,377 --> 01:53:51,436
But you can never walk away.

1795
01:53:54,949 --> 01:53:56,143
Still want to marry me?

1796
01:53:59,921 --> 01:54:03,254
More than anything else
in the world

1797
01:54:08,162 --> 01:54:09,254
Ok

1798
01:54:09,630 --> 01:54:10,927
Huh?

1799
01:54:15,937 --> 01:54:16,926
I will marry you.

1800
01:54:25,346 --> 01:54:26,608
Welcome to the family

1801
01:54:32,520 --> 01:54:33,612
We're getting married.

1802
01:54:34,956 --> 01:54:36,150
We're getting married.

1803
01:54:40,895 --> 01:54:41,987
Good Night.

1804
01:54:43,398 --> 01:54:44,456
Good Night

1805
01:54:50,104 --> 01:54:51,196
Good Night

1806
01:54:53,241 --> 01:54:54,299
Bye

1807
01:55:07,054 --> 01:55:08,351
- Good Night
- Good Night

1808
01:55:35,550 --> 01:55:36,608
Hello.

1809
01:55:36,884 --> 01:55:39,910
I love him. I love him. I love him.

1810
01:55:40,321 --> 01:55:41,413
Who?

1811
01:55:41,556 --> 01:55:43,183
Siddharth. Who else?

1812
01:55:44,325 --> 01:55:47,385
He just dropped me home, and
I didn't want him to leave.

1813
01:55:48,029 --> 01:55:49,121
Why didn't you stop him?

1814
01:55:49,197 --> 01:55:51,563
I couldn't have said 'I
love you, please don't go'

1815
01:55:52,066 --> 01:55:53,158
Why not?

1816
01:55:53,334 --> 01:55:54,392
Just a sec.

1817
01:55:54,569 --> 01:55:57,299
You should have said
this to him. Not me.

1818
01:55:57,438 --> 01:55:59,269
He didn't say it either..

1819
01:55:59,674 --> 01:56:01,039
If he is scared to..

1820
01:56:01,175 --> 01:56:02,233
Scared?

1821
01:56:02,443 --> 01:56:06,140
The poor guy is spending
so much time with you..

1822
01:56:07,448 --> 01:56:10,474
Spending time? It's
not like that at all.

1823
01:56:10,618 --> 01:56:12,609
He is scared. That's what it is.

1824
01:56:13,521 --> 01:56:16,922
He is a complete .. Whatever.

1825
01:56:23,965 --> 01:56:25,432
Oh my God. Its Siddharth's message.

1826
01:56:26,567 --> 01:56:29,263
He loves me. He
loves me. He loves me.

1827
01:56:29,370 --> 01:56:30,462
He said it thrice.

1828
01:56:31,005 --> 01:56:32,370
No silly. Just once.

1829
01:56:33,541 --> 01:56:36,908
Hold on Fidato. I am getting
another call. Maybe its him.

1830
01:56:52,493 --> 01:56:55,291
Fidato. I am so sorry.
I need to leave

1831
01:56:56,998 --> 01:56:58,056
What happened?

1832
01:56:58,933 --> 01:57:00,059
Kabir met with an accident.

1833
01:57:06,107 --> 01:57:08,575
He drove into a tree. Pretty fast.

1834
01:57:09,043 --> 01:57:11,102
He kept saying call Mishka.

1835
01:57:11,312 --> 01:57:12,939
We found your number on his phone.

1836
01:57:14,015 --> 01:57:15,073
Thank you so much.

1837
01:57:16,450 --> 01:57:17,474
Can I see him?

1838
01:57:17,885 --> 01:57:20,285
Sure. But he isn't
completely in his senses.

1839
01:57:20,955 --> 01:57:23,082
Alcohol. Painkillers.

1840
01:57:26,193 --> 01:57:27,285
Hey.

1841
01:57:29,463 --> 01:57:30,930
I am really sorry Mishka.

1842
01:57:32,867 --> 01:57:35,563
I made a huge mistake.
Please forgive me.

1843
01:57:36,003 --> 01:57:37,095
Shhh.

1844
01:57:37,371 --> 01:57:38,929
Just rest Kabir.

1845
01:57:41,042 --> 01:57:42,100
I love you Mishka.

1846
01:57:43,144 --> 01:57:44,270
I really do.

1847
01:57:46,480 --> 01:57:50,211
I tried to forget you
but I couldn't. I love you.

1848
01:57:52,587 --> 01:57:54,077
Where is Bhavna?

1849
01:57:56,591 --> 01:57:59,082
I don't love her. I promise.

1850
01:57:59,160 --> 01:58:02,095
No. I mean was she in the
car during the accident?

1851
01:58:04,465 --> 01:58:07,457
No. We had a fight. And she left.

1852
01:58:09,503 --> 01:58:10,936
But I don't love her.

1853
01:58:11,005 --> 01:58:13,940
Shhh. Please rest for now.

1854
01:58:14,909 --> 01:58:16,137
The doctor says you should sleep.

1855
01:58:17,311 --> 01:58:18,403
No. You'll leave.

1856
01:58:19,947 --> 01:58:21,244
You'll go away to Paris with that..

1857
01:58:23,884 --> 01:58:25,852
.. that Siddharth fellow.

1858
01:58:32,460 --> 01:58:34,894
I'll not go anywhere. Ok?

1859
01:58:36,597 --> 01:58:37,996
I'll die without you Mishka.

1860
01:58:39,600 --> 01:58:43,036
Please don't leave me.
Please don't.

1861
01:58:44,505 --> 01:58:48,032
I'll take you to Paris.

1862
01:58:48,476 --> 01:58:49,568
I swear.

1863
01:58:50,177 --> 01:58:51,235
Ok

1864
01:58:51,412 --> 01:58:52,504
We'll go.

1865
01:58:52,913 --> 01:58:54,039
Ok?

1866
01:58:55,049 --> 01:58:56,380
Go to sleep.

1867
01:59:01,889 --> 01:59:02,947
So you were there all night?

1868
01:59:05,192 --> 01:59:06,352
How is he doing?

1869
01:59:08,996 --> 01:59:11,624
Don't worry. It'll all be fine.

1870
01:59:14,669 --> 01:59:15,931
Can I help in anyway?

1871
01:59:22,143 --> 01:59:23,474
I got your message last night.

1872
01:59:26,213 --> 01:59:28,010
Sorry I couldn't reply back.

1873
01:59:29,216 --> 01:59:30,240
We can discuss that later.

1874
01:59:31,318 --> 01:59:32,546
He needs you right now.

1875
01:59:40,194 --> 01:59:41,320
I should leave.

1876
01:59:44,498 --> 01:59:45,897
Kabir is alone in the hospital.

1877
01:59:50,137 --> 01:59:51,195
Mishka.

1878
01:59:54,308 --> 01:59:55,468
I'll wait for you.

1879
02:00:00,981 --> 02:00:02,107
What did Siddharth say?

1880
02:00:02,583 --> 02:00:05,416
He said Kabir needs me right now.

1881
02:00:06,187 --> 02:00:07,415
And that he'll wait for me.

1882
02:00:08,222 --> 02:00:11,885
If I was in his place I would've
asked you to decide on the spot.

1883
02:00:12,259 --> 02:00:13,419
Kabir.. Or me?

1884
02:00:14,228 --> 02:00:16,128
I can't think straight Fidato.

1885
02:00:16,163 --> 02:00:18,893
What's there to think about?
A relationship that's over..

1886
02:00:20,134 --> 02:00:21,226
What do I do?

1887
02:00:21,402 --> 02:00:22,494
I'll tell you..

1888
02:00:22,837 --> 02:00:24,566
Go to Siddharth's
house right away and..

1889
02:00:25,106 --> 02:00:26,573
Damn.. I am getting another call.

1890
02:00:27,274 --> 02:00:28,400
Shall I call you later?

1891
02:00:28,542 --> 02:00:30,305
No. Stay on the line.

1892
02:00:30,444 --> 02:00:32,036
Please hold. Ok?

1893
02:00:34,582 --> 02:00:35,879
Hello.

1894
02:00:36,517 --> 02:00:37,541
Hello.

1895
02:00:38,085 --> 02:00:40,553
I am scared.

1896
02:00:41,555 --> 02:00:42,852
Don't be scared.

1897
02:00:43,424 --> 02:00:44,516
What happened?

1898
02:00:45,192 --> 02:00:49,856
I am all alone. Will you
talk to me for sometime?

1899
02:00:52,433 --> 02:00:55,630
Sure. We can talk everyday.

1900
02:00:56,504 --> 02:00:58,495
Till you feel better. Ok?

1901
02:00:59,540 --> 02:01:02,236
My dad left.

1902
02:01:03,878 --> 02:01:05,436
He said he'll never come back.

1903
02:01:06,113 --> 02:01:07,478
Mom has gone to look for him.

1904
02:01:09,617 --> 02:01:12,347
I've just swallowed
all her sleeping pills.

1905
02:01:12,953 --> 02:01:14,045
What?

1906
02:01:14,955 --> 02:01:16,013
Where are you?

1907
02:01:17,024 --> 02:01:18,116
Please tell me your name.

1908
02:01:20,261 --> 02:01:21,353
Ankur

1909
02:01:21,428 --> 02:01:24,090
Ankur. Call 999 now.

1910
02:01:24,365 --> 02:01:26,890
Give me your address.
I'll call them.

1911
02:01:27,234 --> 02:01:33,264
Please talk to me
till I fall asleep.

1912
02:01:33,340 --> 02:01:35,604
Ankur please tell me where you are.

1913
02:01:36,310 --> 02:01:37,368
Tell me

1914
02:01:42,049 --> 02:01:44,916
Ankur hang in there. Ok?

1915
02:01:46,420 --> 02:01:51,084
Mishka. Does a boy called
Ankur stay near your house?

1916
02:01:51,492 --> 02:01:53,460
Ya. My neighbor.

1917
02:01:54,428 --> 02:01:56,589
Call 999 now. Right now.

1918
02:02:04,205 --> 02:02:05,263
Ankur?

1919
02:02:06,140 --> 02:02:07,630
On my God. No.

1920
02:02:07,975 --> 02:02:10,102
Ankur wake up. Ankur.

1921
02:02:10,311 --> 02:02:11,369
Ankur.

1922
02:02:20,154 --> 02:02:21,951
Ankur just listen to me.

1923
02:02:22,289 --> 02:02:28,023
All we have is this life.
There is nothing beyond it.

1924
02:02:29,930 --> 02:02:31,989
You wont be able to
hear or see anything.

1925
02:02:32,833 --> 02:02:34,300
It'll be like.. lights out.

1926
02:02:35,436 --> 02:02:38,997
This is it. This is our life.
So hang in there ok?

1927
02:02:39,440 --> 02:02:40,532
Just hang in there.

1928
02:04:09,596 --> 02:04:12,394
Don't worry mam.
Everything is going to be ok.

1929
02:04:25,312 --> 02:04:26,540
Someone you trust.

1930
02:04:28,115 --> 02:04:29,173
Fidato.

1931
02:04:29,516 --> 02:04:31,040
It means someone you trust.

1932
02:04:59,246 --> 02:05:07,244
A forgotten man
in forgotten places

1933
02:05:07,421 --> 02:05:16,022
A forgotten face
from the mirror gazes

1934
02:05:16,296 --> 02:05:24,465
A forgotten man in forgotten places

1935
02:05:25,105 --> 02:05:33,945
A forgotten face
from the mirror gazes

1936
02:05:34,014 --> 02:05:39,281
Neither hope for redemption,
nor desire

1937
02:05:39,353 --> 02:05:45,314
Your affections
wasted on a poor liar

1938
02:05:45,392 --> 02:05:50,989
I walk the path
that solitude traces

1939
02:05:51,165 --> 02:05:56,364
One life, two faces

1940
02:05:56,603 --> 02:06:02,405
One life, two faces

1941
02:06:02,676 --> 02:06:09,582
One life, two faces

1942
02:06:23,330 --> 02:06:24,627
Have you got Mr. Khanna's address?

1943
02:06:25,032 --> 02:06:26,226
- That's done.
- Ok.

1944
02:06:26,467 --> 02:06:28,094
Let me call them then.

1945
02:06:28,569 --> 02:06:31,299
Please explain to him why mom
and dad wont attend our wedding.

1946
02:06:31,438 --> 02:06:36,171
Nick. Think of a wedding with no
music. No dancing.. No champagne.

1947
02:06:36,243 --> 02:06:39,110
So what? Its your parents.
Mine are dead.

1948
02:06:39,179 --> 02:06:41,579
And mine won't come unless
we have a Muslim wedding.

1949
02:06:41,648 --> 02:06:43,639
So lets have one then.

1950
02:06:44,017 --> 02:06:45,177
You are not Muslim Nick.

1951
02:06:45,385 --> 02:06:47,444
I'll be a Muslim. I don't mind.

1952
02:06:47,888 --> 02:06:49,617
Ok. Hand me the scissors Amit.

1953
02:06:51,625 --> 02:06:52,887
What?

1954
02:06:53,961 --> 02:06:55,895
Does that mean I can be a Muslim?

1955
02:06:58,265 --> 02:06:59,425
What's the joke here?

1956
02:06:59,967 --> 02:07:01,025
Hello!

1957
02:07:02,136 --> 02:07:04,070
Can I be a Muslim then?
Does that mean yes?

1958
02:07:08,142 --> 02:07:09,200
What?

1959
02:07:12,412 --> 02:07:13,470
I am fine.

1960
02:07:23,223 --> 02:07:24,315
Hello.

1961
02:07:47,247 --> 02:07:48,339
Why have you come here Siddharth?

1962
02:07:51,118 --> 02:07:52,176
Are you going somewhere?

1963
02:07:54,922 --> 02:07:56,048
Paris.

1964
02:07:57,925 --> 02:07:58,983
Alone?

1965
02:08:02,963 --> 02:08:04,521
Please don't make this
difficult Siddharth.

1966
02:08:05,566 --> 02:08:08,501
Oh. These are for Ankur.

1967
02:08:09,336 --> 02:08:11,531
His mom called.

1968
02:08:12,372 --> 02:08:13,464
What the hell?

1969
02:08:15,676 --> 02:08:16,904
How dare you?

1970
02:08:17,211 --> 02:08:19,509
Kabir. He has come to visit Ankur.

1971
02:08:21,248 --> 02:08:22,340
Oh.

1972
02:08:26,553 --> 02:08:27,850
I'll get the bags.

1973
02:08:34,928 --> 02:08:36,361
- Hey
- Hey

1974
02:08:38,932 --> 02:08:40,024
How are you feeling now?

1975
02:08:40,901 --> 02:08:41,993
Stupid.

1976
02:08:42,970 --> 02:08:44,062
Good.

1977
02:08:49,576 --> 02:08:51,203
You're the same guy
who saved Mishka, Right?

1978
02:08:56,049 --> 02:08:57,346
I have a crush on her.

1979
02:08:59,119 --> 02:09:00,211
So do I

1980
02:09:05,892 --> 02:09:07,018
What happened?

1981
02:09:08,362 --> 02:09:09,488
I messed up.

1982
02:09:11,298 --> 02:09:12,356
It was my fault.

1983
02:09:14,334 --> 02:09:15,528
Maybe in the next life..

1984
02:09:18,105 --> 02:09:19,163
What?

1985
02:09:20,073 --> 02:09:21,472
I told her the same thing.

1986
02:09:23,210 --> 02:09:25,041
She said what if
there isn't another life?

1987
02:09:32,319 --> 02:09:33,411
These are for you.

1988
02:09:42,596 --> 02:09:44,120
I love you. Don't go.

1989
02:09:44,398 --> 02:09:45,922
Hold on. hold on.

1990
02:09:46,133 --> 02:09:47,225
Listen you..

1991
02:09:47,367 --> 02:09:48,459
And specially with him..

1992
02:09:48,602 --> 02:09:49,933
- Not with him.
- What?

1993
02:09:50,103 --> 02:09:51,297
At least I am not as bad as him.

1994
02:09:53,340 --> 02:09:55,035
Kabir what are you doing?
- How dare you?

1995
02:09:55,108 --> 02:09:58,305
He only wants you back
because you were happy without him.

1996
02:09:58,378 --> 02:10:00,005
He can't handle anyone being happy.

1997
02:10:00,080 --> 02:10:01,172
You son of a.. .

1998
02:10:05,585 --> 02:10:08,952
Mishka he doesn't love you.
- Just stop.

1999
02:10:08,989 --> 02:10:11,457
- He just loves himself.
- Shut up. Just Shut up.

2000
02:10:11,525 --> 02:10:13,049
He does not love you.

2001
02:10:13,393 --> 02:10:14,553
Kabir stop it.

2002
02:10:14,928 --> 02:10:16,020
Kabit stop. Just stop.

2003
02:10:16,096 --> 02:10:17,961
- He doesn't love you.
- Shut up.

2004
02:10:20,500 --> 02:10:23,958
Kabit stop. Just stop it.

2005
02:10:26,907 --> 02:10:28,033
Kabir stop it.

2006
02:10:28,842 --> 02:10:30,309
How does it matter? Who is he?

2007
02:10:31,044 --> 02:10:33,274
He is nothing to me.

2008
02:10:36,350 --> 02:10:38,250
Let's go. Please.

2009
02:10:56,470 --> 02:10:57,528
Good boy.

2010
02:10:57,604 --> 02:10:58,866
Omar speech.

2011
02:10:59,139 --> 02:11:01,403
- No way.
- Come on.

2012
02:11:05,045 --> 02:11:06,137
Finally.

2013
02:11:24,297 --> 02:11:25,389
Hey

2014
02:11:27,567 --> 02:11:28,864
Wanna dance?

2015
02:11:31,271 --> 02:11:33,000
So you used to call
me Kutti-ka (bitch)?

2016
02:11:33,507 --> 02:11:34,565
What?

2017
02:11:34,841 --> 02:11:35,865
Kutti-ka?

2018
02:11:35,942 --> 02:11:37,068
No.. no.. no.

2019
02:11:37,377 --> 02:11:39,868
What nonsense? Who said so?

2020
02:11:40,113 --> 02:11:42,274
Sid? I'll kill him.

2021
02:11:46,086 --> 02:11:47,178
Poor guy.

2022
02:11:50,157 --> 02:11:52,182
I think he misses me a lot.

2023
02:11:52,359 --> 02:11:53,883
What?

2024
02:11:54,361 --> 02:11:55,988
Let me go and check on him.

2025
02:11:56,930 --> 02:11:57,988
But..

2026
02:12:03,136 --> 02:12:04,160
Hey

2027
02:12:04,604 --> 02:12:05,866
Hey

2028
02:12:06,039 --> 02:12:07,097
Missing her?

2029
02:12:08,975 --> 02:12:10,135
You are looking beautiful.

2030
02:12:10,377 --> 02:12:11,503
Thanks.

2031
02:12:14,181 --> 02:12:15,273
Dance?

2032
02:12:27,461 --> 02:12:29,520
- What are you doing?
- Practicing my French.

2033
02:12:30,430 --> 02:12:31,954
Just in case you change your mind.

2034
02:12:35,902 --> 02:12:37,460
Ok Mishka. It's my turn now.

2035
02:12:38,905 --> 02:12:40,600
I'll get a job.

2036
02:12:41,208 --> 02:12:43,301
Take care of the house.
Support you.

2037
02:12:43,610 --> 02:12:44,907
Sorry Kabir

2038
02:12:45,612 --> 02:12:49,309
I will not make any more sacrifices,
and won't let anyone do so for me.

2039
02:12:50,050 --> 02:12:52,177
Fine. Then you can
sketch and I'll write.

2040
02:12:53,053 --> 02:12:56,386
- Well you can write anywhere Kabir.
- Oh come on Mishka. Please.

2041
02:12:57,157 --> 02:12:58,351
You know I love you..

2042
02:12:59,493 --> 02:13:00,960
- What?
- Sorry

2043
02:13:02,395 --> 02:13:03,487
Kabir.

2044
02:13:03,597 --> 02:13:07,431
We've become good friends again.
Can't we keep it that way?

2045
02:13:22,215 --> 02:13:23,341
My boarding pass.

2046
02:13:23,950 --> 02:13:25,110
I am coming with you.

2047
02:13:26,586 --> 02:13:29,419
Just tear it off
if you don't love me

2048
02:13:35,462 --> 02:13:37,157
Am I that bad?

2049
02:13:38,031 --> 02:13:39,259
Can't you give me one more chance?

2050
02:13:40,233 --> 02:13:42,394
You wanted me back. Now I am here.

2051
02:13:43,103 --> 02:13:46,231
Because I was happy
with someone else.

2052
02:13:46,540 --> 02:13:48,940
- You just couldn't handle that.
- Just because he says so?

2053
02:13:49,009 --> 02:13:51,170
- Its not about him.
- It is about him.

2054
02:13:53,580 --> 02:13:54,638
You know what?

2055
02:13:55,649 --> 02:13:56,980
He was perfect for you.

2056
02:13:57,384 --> 02:13:59,147
That bloody stammering liar.

2057
02:13:59,319 --> 02:14:01,514
He kept fooling you
and you let him.

2058
02:14:02,289 --> 02:14:04,086
And he would've fooled
you all your life..

2059
02:14:04,157 --> 02:14:05,488
..Had you not caught
him red handed.

2060
02:14:08,562 --> 02:14:10,052
Why did he get caught Kabir?

2061
02:14:11,331 --> 02:14:13,663
Why did he blow his
cover so stupidly?

2062
02:14:14,668 --> 02:14:17,000
Because he wanted to
save Ankur's life.

2063
02:14:18,371 --> 02:14:20,635
He didn't even know Ankur.

2064
02:14:23,243 --> 02:14:24,574
And I don't know you anymore

2065
02:14:27,314 --> 02:14:29,407
You wanted to die for me.

2066
02:14:31,017 --> 02:14:32,507
You didn't want
anything else but me.

2067
02:14:35,288 --> 02:14:37,381
What changed you so much?

2068
02:14:38,158 --> 02:14:39,250
Tell me.

2069
02:14:39,960 --> 02:14:41,120
Where is my Mishka?

2070
02:14:44,331 --> 02:14:46,959
''A unknown friend.. Nameless.
Faceless.

2071
02:14:47,233 --> 02:14:48,325
Just a voice..

2072
02:14:48,401 --> 02:14:52,064
Its good to meet new people..
.. I could be anyone..

2073
02:14:52,138 --> 02:14:56,905
.. If you're sad, just dance..
You are not alone..

2074
02:14:56,977 --> 02:15:00,174
Maybe he wanted to tell the truth..
This life is all we have, isn't it?

2075
02:15:00,246 --> 02:15:01,406
Your phone superman!

2076
02:15:06,186 --> 02:15:07,244
What the hell?

2077
02:15:07,320 --> 02:15:08,685
What the hell.. Mishka!

2078
02:15:09,122 --> 02:15:10,282
What are you doing?

2079
02:15:10,590 --> 02:15:11,648
Just listen to me.

2080
02:15:12,993 --> 02:15:15,985
Have you gone mad?
What are you doing?

2081
02:15:16,429 --> 02:15:19,489
I wanted to die, Kabir.
But now I want to live.

2082
02:15:19,933 --> 02:15:23,232
You said I am not a good artist.
I stopped painting.

2083
02:15:23,403 --> 02:15:25,394
Because of you
I didn't go to Paris.

2084
02:15:25,939 --> 02:15:30,308
I am not Kabir's Mishka anymore.

2085
02:15:30,510 --> 02:15:32,137
I am Siddharth's Mishka now.

2086
02:15:32,178 --> 02:15:33,304
What?

2087
02:15:33,380 --> 02:15:36,440
Yes. He taught me to laugh.

2088
02:15:37,217 --> 02:15:38,445
To dance

2089
02:15:38,518 --> 02:15:40,383
He taught me to live dammit.

2090
02:15:41,588 --> 02:15:43,351
Kabir I love Siddharth.

2091
02:15:44,391 --> 02:15:45,881
And I love Fidato.

2092
02:15:46,326 --> 02:15:49,295
And I don't want to lose either.

2093
02:15:49,362 --> 02:15:51,262
- You listen to me..
- Don't!

2094
02:15:51,631 --> 02:15:53,223
Please don't say anything.

2095
02:15:54,034 --> 02:15:56,059
I want to remember you as a friend.

2096
02:15:58,071 --> 02:15:59,129
Please.

2097
02:16:23,329 --> 02:16:26,127
Ok any second now
this coin is going to..

2098
02:16:29,502 --> 02:16:32,130
It normally works. I swear.

2099
02:16:32,205 --> 02:16:33,297
Champagne?

2100
02:16:34,441 --> 02:16:35,533
Ya.

2101
02:16:36,609 --> 02:16:38,201
So.. What's up?

2102
02:16:41,114 --> 02:16:42,445
Its magic.

2103
02:16:43,083 --> 02:16:44,209
It is.

2104
02:16:47,253 --> 02:16:50,120
Omar is a nice guy.

2105
02:16:50,356 --> 02:16:51,448
I know

2106
02:16:52,158 --> 02:16:54,524
I think he always
had a crush on you.

2107
02:16:56,262 --> 02:16:57,354
I know

2108
02:16:58,164 --> 02:17:01,065
Indians. Bloody Indians

2109
02:17:07,340 --> 02:17:08,432
Sid.

2110
02:17:09,008 --> 02:17:10,066
He's jealous.

2111
02:17:10,543 --> 02:17:11,669
Sid.

2112
02:17:12,612 --> 02:17:13,977
Come with me.

2113
02:17:16,116 --> 02:17:17,105
Sid.

2114
02:17:19,419 --> 02:17:21,046
Sid its Mishka's call.

2115
02:17:27,494 --> 02:17:28,927
He lied to me Fidato.

2116
02:17:29,062 --> 02:17:30,120
What?

2117
02:17:30,263 --> 02:17:31,321
Mishka.

2118
02:17:31,965 --> 02:17:34,331
Where are you Mishka? Paris?

2119
02:17:37,203 --> 02:17:39,000
He broke my heart Fidato.

2120
02:17:39,506 --> 02:17:40,598
Who?

2121
02:17:41,474 --> 02:17:42,532
Kabir?

2122
02:17:44,410 --> 02:17:45,536
What did he do?

2123
02:17:46,379 --> 02:17:48,176
He kept listening to my secrets.

2124
02:17:49,115 --> 02:17:51,413
And used them to impress me.

2125
02:17:53,586 --> 02:17:54,917
I am sorry Mishka.

2126
02:17:56,623 --> 02:17:57,954
I didn't mean to hurt you.

2127
02:17:58,625 --> 02:18:00,058
What should I do Fidato?

2128
02:18:00,560 --> 02:18:01,652
You tell me.

2129
02:18:02,028 --> 02:18:04,292
You. My best friend.

2130
02:18:05,999 --> 02:18:07,899
You help me with everything.

2131
02:18:09,202 --> 02:18:11,102
What should I do?

2132
02:18:11,304 --> 02:18:12,669
Give me one more chance.

2133
02:18:20,180 --> 02:18:23,877
Do whatever your heart says..

2134
02:18:25,151 --> 02:18:26,277
Don't listen to anyone else.

2135
02:18:30,456 --> 02:18:32,185
The bridge will open in 10 minutes.

2136
02:18:33,092 --> 02:18:35,526
If he reaches here before that..

2137
02:18:35,862 --> 02:18:37,887
Bridge? What bridge?

2138
02:18:38,631 --> 02:18:39,928
Tower bridge?

2139
02:18:39,999 --> 02:18:41,091
I am coming.

2140
02:18:41,401 --> 02:18:43,130
- Promise?
- Promise.

2141
02:18:55,648 --> 02:18:57,275
Enjoy your time everyone.

2142
02:19:50,637 --> 02:19:53,003
Sid you weirdo.
Why are you running?

2143
02:19:55,909 --> 02:19:58,070
- What are you doing Sid?
- Get in quickly!

2144
02:19:59,646 --> 02:20:02,080
- You ok?
- Ya. Go Go Go.

2145
02:20:02,148 --> 02:20:03,638
I am going as fast as I can.

2146
02:20:03,917 --> 02:20:05,009
Go.

2147
02:20:05,084 --> 02:20:07,109
Hurry up. Go faster. Come on.
- Baby relax.

2148
02:20:07,186 --> 02:20:10,019
- Tell him to slow down.
- Step on it Nick!

2149
02:20:10,657 --> 02:20:11,919
Shall I slow down?

2150
02:20:11,991 --> 02:20:13,356
Nick. You are my hero.

2151
02:20:13,893 --> 02:20:15,417
Make this happen. Come on.

2152
02:20:15,495 --> 02:20:18,521
- You're a banker, not a hero.
- Is this a one way or not?

2153
02:20:18,598 --> 02:20:19,997
Sid is this a one way?

2154
02:20:20,066 --> 02:20:21,363
- Amit?
- Slower.

2155
02:20:21,434 --> 02:20:22,492
Eyes on the road!

2156
02:20:23,102 --> 02:20:25,332
- Nick hurry up.
- Keep your hands off her.

2157
02:20:29,976 --> 02:20:32,069
- No.. slower.
- Amit!

2158
02:20:32,145 --> 02:20:33,942
- Just go. Just go.
- Faster Nick.

2159
02:20:34,113 --> 02:20:35,239
Should I slow down now?

2160
02:20:35,315 --> 02:20:37,545
Nick Yoshihara. Do
you want a divorce?

2161
02:20:40,620 --> 02:20:42,520
Go faster Nick. Go.. Go.

2162
02:20:46,592 --> 02:20:47,957
Oh god.

2163
02:20:50,430 --> 02:20:52,625
- Stop. Stop. - Officer
there is someone on the bridge.

2164
02:20:52,899 --> 02:20:54,389
- She is my..
- Quiet.

2165
02:20:54,467 --> 02:20:57,334
- Officer please..
someone is on the.. - Get back.

2166
02:20:57,403 --> 02:20:59,598
You insane crazy maniacs.

2167
02:20:59,872 --> 02:21:01,032
- Officer please.
- Get back!

2168
02:21:01,107 --> 02:21:02,199
Quiet!

2169
02:21:12,051 --> 02:21:13,416
Guys. Its too late.

2170
02:21:13,486 --> 02:21:14,578
Too late?

2171
02:21:14,921 --> 02:21:15,979
Too late for what?

2172
02:21:16,289 --> 02:21:19,053
For the.. uhh..
- That's what we were saying.

2173
02:21:19,225 --> 02:21:20,453
It is too late.

2174
02:21:21,260 --> 02:21:22,522
My water just broke.

2175
02:21:22,595 --> 02:21:23,857
What?

2176
02:21:23,930 --> 02:21:25,397
I am going into labor.

2177
02:21:25,898 --> 02:21:29,095
Officer. Help.

2178
02:21:29,168 --> 02:21:30,897
- Breath. Just Breathe.
- Quiet.

2179
02:21:31,337 --> 02:21:35,137
- We having a baby.
- Wait here. I'll go get help.

2180
02:21:35,575 --> 02:21:39,033
Quiet. Calm down.

2181
02:21:50,189 --> 02:21:53,215
- False alarm.. false alarm.
- False alarm.

2182
02:21:54,160 --> 02:21:56,185
Hey. Where is that guy?

2183
02:22:48,147 --> 02:22:49,307
Mishka!

2184
02:23:05,932 --> 02:23:09,424
If you ever lie to me again,
or break my heart,

2185
02:23:10,103 --> 02:23:12,401
You and I will be on
opposite sides of the bridge.

2186
02:23:14,907 --> 02:23:16,033
Forever!

2187
02:23:19,645 --> 02:23:21,306
Get off the bridge sir.

2188
02:24:08,694 --> 02:24:12,630
I've been waiting
for the moonlight..

2189
02:24:13,933 --> 02:24:18,597
I've been waiting
for the moonlit sky..

2190
02:24:19,272 --> 02:24:22,639
All night.

2191
02:24:24,977 --> 02:24:29,971
Out in the distance you are..
Here I am, so very far..

2192
02:24:30,917 --> 02:24:35,411
Without you, so desolate am I..

2193
02:24:36,489 --> 02:24:41,984
Here right now, if
it were you and I..

2194
02:24:42,261 --> 02:24:46,925
I'd hold your hand so..

2195
02:24:48,201 --> 02:24:52,934
I'd never let you go..

2196
02:24:56,209 --> 02:25:00,305
I've been waiting..
Waiting waiting..

2197
02:25:00,613 --> 02:25:05,676
All my life for the moonlit sky..

2198
02:25:06,953 --> 02:25:10,980
I've been waiting for a lifetime...

2199
02:25:11,924 --> 02:25:18,853
.. for you.
