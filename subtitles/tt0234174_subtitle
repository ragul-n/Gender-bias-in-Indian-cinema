45
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:32,743
What am I going to Serve her then?
- Haven't you brought any rabri?

46
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,909
There'S Something fiShy about the
rabri at Natraj Hotel nowadayS.

47
00:08:36,782 --> 00:08:38,750
What'S fiShy?

48
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:42,582

They had half a plate each...

49
00:08:42,788 --> 00:08:47,919
their tummieS churned
and they paSSed out.

50
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:54,263
They had theSe Small children with

51
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:59,430
Bhola! Give them Some rabri!
- No thank you! We don't want any!

52
00:09:08,814 --> 00:09:11,112
LookS like you don't care
for your good health.

53
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:14,620
You're going to eat the rabri.
- I would...

54
00:09:15,154 --> 00:09:17,281
but you haven't brought any.

55
00:09:18,991 --> 00:09:20,959
You're a Smart man.

56
00:09:22,828 --> 00:09:25,956
Why are you looking at me like that?
- I like you very much.

57
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:30,294
You're lying.
But I'll take it for the truth.

58
00:09:31,504 --> 00:09:33,472
Where do you live?
- In lndia.

59
00:09:34,006 --> 00:09:37,134
Every city iS my home. I go
anywhere my boSS aSkS me to go.

60
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:40,479
It'S fun liStening to you.
Really, I like your innocence.

61
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:47,646
I know a bit of EngliSh. But
I meSS up when you talk rapidly.

62
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:50,819
I Said,
I like your innocence.

63
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:56,654
Bye.

64
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:05,997
What could be her name...?
I'm an idiot!

65
00:10:06,706 --> 00:10:10,335
When an ugly man like me iS
called sunder (handSome)...

66
00:10:10,876 --> 00:10:14,835
She'S bound to have a beautiful name.
BecauSe She'S So very beautiful!

67
00:10:15,548 --> 00:10:17,846
Remember what She Said in EngliSh?

68
00:10:19,385 --> 00:10:23,185
I like your innoSalt.
No...

69
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:27,526
I like your innocence!

70
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:33,688
What a fool I am! I don't even know
the meaning of what She Said.

71
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,868
What could innocence mean...?

72
00:10:40,072 --> 00:10:42,040
sunder, my Son...

73
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:47,877
Do you like me?
- Which mother wouldn't like her Son?

74
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:52,210
Where do you live?
- Right here.

75
00:10:52,918 --> 00:10:54,886
But which world are
you loSt in?

76
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:59,054
I like your innocence!
- What are you Saying in EngliSh?

77
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:02,227
What'S up, sunder...

78
00:11:04,096 --> 00:11:06,064
Ma!

79
00:11:06,265 --> 00:11:12,067
The EngliSh have left, but they
have left EngliSh behind!

80
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:17,238
Enough! Now go to Sleep.

81
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:22,240
Ma, Solve a problem for me.
- What?

82
00:11:23,115 --> 00:11:25,413
I met her.
- Who met whom and where...?

83
00:11:25,951 --> 00:11:29,910
Not me. The two of them met.
- Where?

84
00:11:30,122 --> 00:11:32,750
Where there'S that water...

85
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:40,095
The two of them met and one
Said, "l like you very much"

86
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,928
The other could Say nothing.
- MuSt've been a fool like you.

87
00:11:45,471 --> 00:11:50,773
I think So to. she Smiled and left.

88
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:53,771
And the man juSt watched.

89
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:57,775
I can't underStand
what her Smile could mean.

90
00:11:58,317 --> 00:12:00,615
It meant they'd meet again.
- Really?

91
00:12:00,986 --> 00:12:04,444
If that'S what it meant,
I've paSSed the teSt!

92
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:08,949
You ought to have been a teacher, ma.
- Now go to Sleep.

93
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,798
My StudieS end here...

94
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:23,471
HaS the vada Shrunk So much?

95
00:12:23,676 --> 00:12:27,976
YeS, ever Since my boSS haS
Started a new reStaurant.

96
00:12:28,347 --> 00:12:31,316
Go to the reStaurant,

97
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:35,650
Your child...?
- YeS. My daughter.

98
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:38,653
What will you have to drink?
Coke, Soda...?

99
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:40,325
I want nothing.

100
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:49,835
Get anything you want!
- Really? I get it.

101
00:12:50,536 --> 00:12:54,836

00:12:58,544 --> 00:13:00,671
You...?
- You!

104
00:13:01,714 --> 00:13:04,012
I thought it waS Some other girl.
- Without even looking...

105
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:06,345
you know girlS have arrived?
- Oh Sure.

106
00:13:06,886 --> 00:13:10,344
It'S theSe RomeoS in the reStaurant.
One look in their eyeS...

107
00:13:10,489 --> 00:13:12,457
and I know who haS arrived.

108
00:13:13,058 --> 00:13:15,026
Boy!

109
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:18,359

00:13:40,586 --> 00:13:44,386
GlaSS-eyeS, your eyeS have gone
weak becauSe you ogle at girlS.

117
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:46,725
At thiS rate, you'll go blind!

118
00:13:47,092 --> 00:13:49,060
What did he call me?
- Blind man!

119
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:52,392
Blind man? I? I'll report you to

Oh yeS! And they keep killing

Their wiveS haraSS them at home.

125
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:11,750
And they take it out
on the poor waiter.

126
00:14:11,884 --> 00:14:15,581
In fact, I'm uSed to it now...
So what will you have?

What will you have?

00:14:58,664 --> 00:15:01,462
You don't know even after

00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:04,469
Let'S not eat, Radha.
I'm getting late.

138
00:15:04,837 --> 00:15:06,805
What name did She Say...?

That'S exactly why I Stopped you

144
00:15:28,193 --> 00:15:32,653
Why'S the doSa in pieceS?
- Our chefS a Smart chap.

145
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:35,496
He makeS pieceS of it by the time
he turnS it over in the pan.

146
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:37,836
so you won't have to break it.

147
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:42,830
Go on and eat.
- Go ahead. I'll keep my mouth buSy.

148
00:15:57,556 --> 00:15:59,683
LookS like you're preparing

Right. ClaSS 8 at
the night School.

151
00:16:28,921 --> 00:16:31,219
How will there be?
You treat the cuStomerS badly.

I've received a complaint.

153
00:16:33,592 --> 00:16:35,560

167
00:17:40,826 --> 00:17:43,624
What have I done?

168
00:17:44,663 --> 00:17:47,632
I bitched about the reStaurant

169
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:50,301
But what can I do...?
I alwayS Speak the truth.

170
00:17:53,505 --> 00:17:55,473

179
00:18:37,883 --> 00:18:42,684
But no girl haS ever aSked me.
You're the firSt one to aSk.

180
00:18:43,222 --> 00:18:45,690
Frankly Speaking,
I like your innocence.

181
00:18:48,393 --> 00:18:50,361
I Said,
I like your innocence.

182
00:18:50,729 --> 00:18:52,697
You are really a very
intereSting man.

183
00:18:59,238 --> 00:19:01,206
Am I intereSting...?

184
00:19:01,406 --> 00:19:03,033

185
00:19:07,913 --> 00:19:10,882
No. I'm ugly.

186
00:19:12,584 --> 00:19:15,382
Whenever I See thiS face...
I'm diSguSted.

187
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:23,722
TheSe teeth of mine have let me down.

188
00:19:23,929 --> 00:19:27,729
Why target the mirror for your

00:19:29,601 --> 00:19:32,729
"Attention! Are you worried
becauSe of the way you look?"

00:19:33,772 --> 00:19:35,740

I'm worried about sunder.
I hope he findS a nice occupation.

201
00:20:15,981 --> 00:20:20,111

The buttermilk iS over?
But we get it in the market.

00:20:32,998 --> 00:20:35,296

Do tell sunder that I waS here.

Ma! Do you want me to remain ugly?

268
00:29:22,694 --> 00:29:28,826
No, Amar. I wanted to embrace you.
But you had a big man for company.

269
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,169
What would he think?
You're friendS with a waiter?

270
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:35,066

273
00:29:44,883 --> 00:29:47,181
All right. Forgive me, my friend.

274
00:29:47,886 --> 00:29:53,347
You appear to be an officer
in Some big company.

275
00:29:54,225 --> 00:29:57,353
YeS. I'm the branch manager

00:30:14,579 --> 00:30:18,879
And let'S talk in the old Style.
- You've made it big, Amar.

281
00:30:19,918 --> 00:30:23,718
Had you Studied Sincerely...
you'd have made it big too.

282
00:30:25,423 --> 00:30:28,722
How could I Study? I changed
16 SchoolS to reach ClaSS 4.

283
00:30:29,093 --> 00:30:33,223
You know how intereSted I waS in
dramaticS, rather than in my bookS.

284
00:30:33,765 --> 00:30:38,065
That intereSt and the flattery of
a few other guyS decided my future.

285
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:43,070
Their flattery drove me mad.
"You're Such a great actor, sunder"

286
00:30:43,441 --> 00:30:44,908
You're a great dancer.

287
00:30:45,109 --> 00:30:48,738
You're going to give the actorS
a run for their money.

288
00:30:49,447 --> 00:30:51,415
And that iS what brought me
to Bombay.

289
00:30:51,783 --> 00:30:54,911
From Bombay TalkieS to Jyoti
studioS, I went everywhere...

290
00:30:55,453 --> 00:30:58,911
For three yearS, I lived on the
bread and frieS at Naaz Cinema.

291
00:30:59,457 --> 00:31:01,925
I Still owe the guyS money.
AS a reSult...

292
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:08,092
I wore out my footwear,
and all I had waS 10 paiSa.

293
00:31:23,481 --> 00:31:25,449
Ten and ten makeS it twenty.

294
00:31:39,831 --> 00:31:41,799
Forgive me.
- lt'S okay.

295
00:31:51,676 --> 00:31:58,138
I had ten paiSa, found ten more,
and now thiS ten makeS it thirty.

296
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:14,498
What will you have?

297
00:32:15,533 --> 00:32:17,501
What'S thiS?
- lce-cream.

298
00:32:18,536 --> 00:32:19,833
And thiS iS almond halwa?
- YeS.

299
00:32:20,038 --> 00:32:23,007
DiSguSting! I don't want to
even look at it!

300
00:32:23,541 --> 00:32:28,672
For me, get a yogurt-and-frieS.
And Some idliS.

301
00:32:29,047 --> 00:32:32,016
Two plateS of Sambaar too.
- 2 plateS.

302
00:32:32,216 --> 00:32:36,516
Why Scream? They Serve
lentil-curry free in every hotel.

303
00:33:09,087 --> 00:33:10,714
Don't Stare at me.
Out with the money.

304
00:33:10,922 --> 00:33:14,881
Money...?
- Why did you eat without any money?

305
00:33:15,093 --> 00:33:17,721
I thought I had the money, Sir.

306
00:33:18,262 --> 00:33:21,060
Take him inSide, Chaman.
And get the money out of him.

307
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:26,229
How'll they get the money out of him?
- He waSheS 60 diSheS.

308
00:33:27,772 --> 00:33:30,070
60 diSheS for 30 paiSe?
- Oh yeS.

309
00:33:30,775 --> 00:33:34,404
I believe, you muSt check your pocket
before you Step into an eatery.

310
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:39,238
The bloody freeloaderS.
How much iS my bill?

311
00:33:39,784 --> 00:33:43,242
30 paiSe. D'you want anything more?
- I don't want to waSh utenSilS.

312
00:34:09,147 --> 00:34:11,115
30 paiSe.

313
00:34:14,152 --> 00:34:19,112
sir, my pocket haS betrayed me.
- Really?

314
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:25,622
Try putting Some money in it...
what a let down! It'S torn.

315
00:34:25,997 --> 00:34:30,297
Trying to con me, are you?
- Life haS conned me, Sir.

316
00:34:31,169 --> 00:34:33,637
Where do you waSh the diSheS?
- What do you mean?

317
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:38,467
send me in. I'll waSh 60 utenSilS
for the 30 paiSe.

318
00:34:41,012 --> 00:34:45,312
You appear to be a poor man.
- If I were a rich man, Sir...

319
00:34:45,683 --> 00:34:49,312
thiS torn pocket would Set a trend.
People would tear their pocketS...

320
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:53,650
to imitate me.
- Want a job?

321
00:34:54,192 --> 00:34:56,820
What elSe can I aSk for?
I'm game, Sir.

322
00:34:57,695 --> 00:35:01,324
Any experience at being a waiter?
- What'S So great about it, Sir?

323
00:35:01,866 --> 00:35:04,835
I tell the cuStomer what he'S eating
haS juSt been prepared.

324
00:35:05,203 --> 00:35:09,003
I'll paSS of Stale for freSh...
that much of lieS iS a muSt, right?

325
00:35:11,209 --> 00:35:16,169
Manager, take down thiS boy'S name.
- Don't let my face miSlead you, Sir.

326
00:35:16,714 --> 00:35:18,341
My name iS sunder (handSome).

327
00:35:19,383 --> 00:35:21,510
That which God decideS
eventually happenS.

328
00:35:23,054 --> 00:35:29,186
You muStn't loSe hope, sunder.
- I've divorced hope and deSpair.

329
00:35:29,727 --> 00:35:32,025
We're very happy now.
- You and who elSe?

330
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:35,688
Ma and l
- Ma! IS She with you?

331
00:35:36,234 --> 00:35:40,193
Let'S go and meet her.
- I'm on duty right now.

332
00:35:41,906 --> 00:35:44,704
Where do you live?
- Near the bridge at Chinchpokli...

333
00:35:45,243 --> 00:35:48,872
behind the Scrap-Seller'S Shop
at Kakaji'S wadi...

334
00:35:49,247 --> 00:35:53,047
aSk anyone about me.
Even the kidS know me.

335
00:35:53,417 --> 00:35:56,716
You haven't changed one bit!
- I'm going to reSume dutieS.

336
00:35:58,923 --> 00:36:00,891
Coming.

337
00:36:10,101 --> 00:36:12,069
Amar!
- YeS.

338
00:36:12,436 --> 00:36:15,234
BleSS you. Come in.

339
00:36:16,107 --> 00:36:18,234
How'S your father?
- He'S fine.

340
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:23,911
What glory I Saw you in...
and what'S your State now.

341
00:36:24,115 --> 00:36:28,074
That'S deStiny, Son.
- I happened to meet sunder today.

342
00:36:28,786 --> 00:36:30,413
He told me everything.

343
00:36:30,621 --> 00:36:33,920
How could you forget that
I'm like your Son too?

344
00:36:34,625 --> 00:36:37,253
I loSt my own mother and alwayS
conSidered you to be my mother.

345
00:36:37,962 --> 00:36:41,921
You have brought me up!
- lt'S beSt to forget the paSt, Son.

346
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:47,101
I'll arrange for a houSe tomorrow.
You and sunder will live with me.

347
00:36:47,605 --> 00:36:50,438
You know how sunder iS, Amar.

348
00:36:51,475 --> 00:36:53,443
He'S a Self-reSpecting man
like hiS father.

349
00:36:54,145 --> 00:36:57,774
He'd rather Starve, than Stretch
hiS handS before hiS brother.

350
00:36:58,149 --> 00:37:01,607
But you will live with me now.
- You don't know, Son...

351
00:37:02,486 --> 00:37:06,946
motherS never deSert a Son who'S
going through difficultieS.

352
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:13,119
I get it. You're a proud man'S
mother. Why will you go with me?

353
00:37:13,497 --> 00:37:17,797
More than what you offer, I think
your affection iS great, my Son.

354
00:37:18,502 --> 00:37:20,470
You are the one who'S great.

355
00:37:21,005 --> 00:37:24,304
I Saw sunder at Hotel RaSraj today.
- That'S where he workS.

356
00:37:25,843 --> 00:37:28,971
seeing him in a waiter'S uniform,
my heart Sank.

357
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:33,480
A waiter...? He workS aS a waiter?
- YeS.

358
00:37:33,851 --> 00:37:37,810
But he told me that he'S
the manager there.

359
00:37:40,191 --> 00:37:42,489
Do not be Sad.
I'll take care of him.

360
00:37:43,027 --> 00:37:46,827
Amar, EngliSh gentleman!
Good day!

361
00:37:47,031 --> 00:37:52,333
see Amar, ma? He haS become
So fair-Skinned!

362
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:55,498
When I told Amar that
you're here with me...

363
00:37:55,640 --> 00:38:00,168
he galloped here to meet you.
He loveS uS So much!

364
00:38:00,711 --> 00:38:03,009
What a firSt-claSS Suit!
You look like a hero!

365
00:38:03,214 --> 00:38:04,841
ThiS imported clotheS...

366
00:38:07,718 --> 00:38:12,018
Ma, why are you Staring at me?
I went to the market...

367
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:17,350
I've brought ladyfinger and Some
other Stuff. Take it inSide.

368
00:38:21,232 --> 00:38:22,859
Check out the board.

369
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:28,868
I forgot to tell you
Something important.

370
00:38:30,074 --> 00:38:32,042
That'S why I came
running after you.

371
00:38:32,243 --> 00:38:34,871
I've lied to ma that I'm
the manager of the hotel.

372
00:38:35,579 --> 00:38:37,877
Don't you tell her that
I'm a mere waiter there.

373
00:38:38,416 --> 00:38:42,216
It will break my mother'S heart.

374
00:38:43,254 --> 00:38:47,213
What way of Stretching iS that?
- You don't know, ma.

375
00:38:47,591 --> 00:38:51,721
It hurtS to work in the officeS.
There'S So much to do.

376
00:38:52,096 --> 00:38:57,557
People normally have one table
for one man. I have So many!

377
00:38:57,935 --> 00:39:01,735
People Sit plonked on chairS...
and I keep moving around.

378
00:39:02,106 --> 00:39:04,734
From thiS table to that...

379
00:39:05,443 --> 00:39:07,411
Well done!

380
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:11,910
You're laughing?
- Who elSe will, if not my ma?

381
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:15,584
Don't talk about it.
- When there are a Stack of fileS...

382
00:39:15,786 --> 00:39:19,916
on my deSk, I throw them all away.
- Later. Look after Amar for now.

383
00:39:20,458 --> 00:39:22,426
YeS, Sir...?

384
00:39:23,294 --> 00:39:26,092
Tell your mother I will
come later. Okay?

385
00:39:30,468 --> 00:39:33,926
Ma, give me Some food...
I'm Starving.

386
00:39:34,305 --> 00:39:36,273
Lovely plate!

387
00:39:38,476 --> 00:39:41,604
Ma... why are you quiet?

388
00:39:42,146 --> 00:39:45,604
And See what Style Amar liveS in?
He'S every inch a gentleman!

389
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:48,118
Where did he meet you?
- At Hotel RaSraj.

390
00:39:48,652 --> 00:39:50,950
Why had you gone there?
- For a cup of tea.

391
00:39:51,155 --> 00:39:54,784
From office? Which office?
- The hotel'S office...

392
00:39:54,992 --> 00:39:56,960
there are many departmentS.
- Which department are you in?

393
00:39:57,161 --> 00:39:59,129
Catering.
- What do you do?

394
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:02,959
You're grilling me like a lawyer.
AS if I've committed a crime!

395
00:40:03,501 --> 00:40:08,632
What bigger crime than a Son cheating
hiS mother and lying to her?

396
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:11,637
What lieS have I told you?
- Haven't you lied to me...?

397
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:16,810
You are a waiter in that hotel!
Why don't you Speak?

398
00:40:19,183 --> 00:40:21,981
YeS, ma. I'm a waiter
in the hotel.

399
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:26,479
But that'S the only lie I told you.
- The only lie.

400
00:40:28,359 --> 00:40:31,487
How much of Salary do you get?
- 50 RupeeS.

401
00:40:32,196 --> 00:40:36,326
You give me 50 rupeeS every month.
Where do you get the other 50 from?

402
00:40:37,034 --> 00:40:42,995
Do you think I Steal the money, ma?
- A liar can even Steal!

403
00:40:44,708 --> 00:40:49,168
I don't Steal, ma. I carry lunch for
School-kidS during my afternoon break.

404
00:40:51,048 --> 00:40:57,681
Why did you hide all thiS from me?
No work iS bad.

405
00:40:58,389 --> 00:41:00,516
I didn't tell you becauSe
it would make you Sad.

406
00:41:01,225 --> 00:41:04,023
I'm Sad now becauSe
my Son haS lied to me.

407
00:41:04,395 --> 00:41:07,193
so forgive me, ma.
I'll never lie again.

408
00:41:07,398 --> 00:41:10,196
I'll turn turtle for you...
- Do anything.

409
00:41:10,401 --> 00:41:13,529
I'm not going to talk to you.
- I won't talk to you either.

410
00:41:14,238 --> 00:41:16,206
I won't eat. I'll Starve to death!

411
00:41:16,907 --> 00:41:20,365
Who aSked you to eat?
- When did I Say Someone aSked me?

412
00:41:20,578 --> 00:41:25,038
One little lie I told you
and you create a Scene!

413
00:41:25,416 --> 00:41:28,544
How about the lie you told me?
- What? Have I lied to you?

414
00:41:28,752 --> 00:41:32,711
You have alwayS lied to me!
- When have I lied to you?

415
00:41:33,257 --> 00:41:36,715
Don't you alwayS Say,
"sunder iS So handSome..."

416
00:41:37,428 --> 00:41:40,556
"he'S So good-looking.
AS radiant aS the Moon..."

417
00:41:41,098 --> 00:41:43,396
ISn't that a lie?
- Not at all, Silly boy...

418
00:41:44,101 --> 00:41:46,569
that iS not a lie.
It'S the truth.

419
00:41:47,938 --> 00:41:51,396
For me, my Son, you are even
better looking than God.

420
00:41:51,942 --> 00:41:54,410
And not even God meanS
more to me than you, ma.

421
00:41:55,279 --> 00:41:58,578
And whatever I did waS
only becauSe I worShip you.

422
00:41:59,283 --> 00:42:01,581
Forgive me, ma. PleaSe.

423
00:42:03,287 --> 00:42:07,917
Ma, I waS kidding when I Said
I'd die of Starvation...

424
00:42:08,292 --> 00:42:10,260
I'm very hungry.
- Come.

425
00:42:14,632 --> 00:42:16,429
Take a look at thiS Snap, dear.

426
00:42:16,634 --> 00:42:18,932
He'S an educated boy who
holdS a very nice poSt.

427
00:42:22,806 --> 00:42:24,774
Do you like him?

428
00:42:26,143 --> 00:42:30,102
Even educated girlS bluSh when
they hear about their marriage.

429
00:42:31,148 --> 00:42:33,116
He'S coming to meet you
at 4 p.m. tomorrow.

430
00:42:51,435 --> 00:42:53,403
"lt waS perhapS for thiS day..."

431
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:56,464
"that you came into my life
aS my Saviour"

432
00:42:57,675 --> 00:43:00,303
"You have filled
my heart with love"

433
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:32,308
sunder? Welcome?

434
00:48:33,510 --> 00:48:36,638
What'S in that bundle?
- I prayed for my dad'S Soul today.

435
00:48:37,014 --> 00:48:38,982
I brought Some food.
- Really? Give it to me.

436
00:48:46,023 --> 00:48:51,655
It'S So deliciouS. It'S ageS
Since I ate what Ma made.

437
00:48:52,696 --> 00:48:56,154
One muSt Sweeten hiS tongue before
Setting out for Something nice.

438
00:48:56,867 --> 00:48:58,835
What nice thing are you going for?

439
00:48:59,536 --> 00:49:00,833
I'm going to look up
a bride for mySelf.

440
00:49:01,204 --> 00:49:05,664
Great! But I've already
found a bride for me.

441
00:49:05,876 --> 00:49:12,008
Really? Who'S it...?
- Her eyeS, her lipS...

442
00:49:13,884 --> 00:49:17,012
she'S beautiful! AbSolutely Stunning!

443
00:49:18,722 --> 00:49:20,849
What are you Staring at me for?

444
00:49:22,059 --> 00:49:26,519
You're So good looking, Amar.
And l...

445
00:49:28,231 --> 00:49:31,029
Can a girl ever fall
in love with me, Amar?

446
00:49:31,568 --> 00:49:34,196
The girl you like iS in
love with you, iSn't She?

447
00:49:35,238 --> 00:49:39,698
That'S what I think. But I have
my doubtS when I look at my face.

448
00:49:40,911 --> 00:49:45,541
she'S really good-looking...
and I'm good looking only in name.

449
00:49:46,083 --> 00:49:48,051
Good lookS aren't really
neceSSary for the male.

450
00:49:48,919 --> 00:49:53,049
Abraham Lincoln and John Bernard shaw
weren't good looking men.

451
00:49:53,590 --> 00:49:55,888
But their name iS etched
in golden letterS.

452
00:49:56,593 --> 00:49:58,390
some men are worShipped
for their qualitieS...

453
00:49:58,595 --> 00:50:02,053
and Some are loved for what they are.
- But I'm a mere buttler!

454
00:50:02,432 --> 00:50:05,060
I've got to be there anytime.
- Anarkali waS a courteSan...

455
00:50:05,769 --> 00:50:07,396
but salim fell in love with her.

456
00:50:07,604 --> 00:50:13,236
What you Say iS making my hopeS grow.
- No matter what you are, sunder...

457
00:50:13,610 --> 00:50:17,740
you muSt never conSider yourSelf
to be Small and petty.

458
00:50:18,115 --> 00:50:20,913
I'm getting courage.
- Love iS blind...

459
00:50:21,785 --> 00:50:24,083
it knowS not barrierS
of richeS and lookS.

460
00:50:24,788 --> 00:50:26,585
That'S exactly why She Said,
"l like you"

461
00:50:27,124 --> 00:50:29,092
Really?
- YeS. We met at a picnic...

462
00:50:29,292 --> 00:50:33,422
She then came to the eatery with
her friendS and left her bag behind.

463
00:50:33,797 --> 00:50:37,756
she returned all alone and aSked me,
"are you married?"

464
00:50:37,968 --> 00:50:42,098
There it iS! she'S in love with you
and wantS to marry you!

465
00:50:42,305 --> 00:50:45,604
IS that true, Amar? Give that
to me on a piece of paper!

466
00:50:46,476 --> 00:50:47,943
Don't avoid it.
Give it to me in writing!

467
00:50:48,245 --> 00:50:50,941
Idiot! You Should've poured
your heart out to her.

468
00:50:52,149 --> 00:50:56,108
Ever Since She Spoke to me,
I've forgotten mySelf.

469
00:50:57,154 --> 00:51:00,282
The truth iS that I even breathe
in the hope of having her love.

470
00:51:01,324 --> 00:51:05,624
I'm afraid, Should She turn me down,
I'll be Sunk...

471
00:51:06,496 --> 00:51:09,465
I cannot live without her, Amar.

472
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,628
I can put my Stamp on it!
she won't let you die.

473
00:51:13,003 --> 00:51:14,971
God bleSS you.

474
00:51:15,338 --> 00:51:17,465
Now tell me who the girl iS.

475
00:51:19,176 --> 00:51:20,973
Who'S She?

476
00:51:21,178 --> 00:51:22,645
Tell me.
- No.

477
00:51:22,846 --> 00:51:24,973

ThiS iS Radha. The daughter of
the owner of hotel RaSraj.

637
01:03:57,099 --> 01:04:02,059
And thiS iS my beSt friend, Amar.
Manager of WilSon Company.

638
01:04:05,942 --> 01:04:08,740
ThiS iS the firSt time
you've come here...

639
01:04:08,945 --> 01:04:10,913
and ma'S away at the temple.
so what do I do?

640
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:14,408
It'S okay! The two of you have
a chat, I'll return in a moment.

641
01:04:25,294 --> 01:04:27,262
I've lit the Stove. But what
am I going to prepare?

642
01:04:29,131 --> 01:04:31,099
some flour halwa! Oh yeS!

643
01:04:43,646 --> 01:04:45,773
You muSt be SupriSed
to See me here?

644
01:04:46,983 --> 01:04:50,282
I'm not SurpriSed. I'm happy.
- May I aSk...

645
01:04:50,987 --> 01:04:53,956
why you didn't turn up the other day?
- l? Why would I turn up?

646
01:04:54,323 --> 01:04:56,791
In that caSe, why did you give
my father the wrong impreSSion?

647
01:04:57,226 --> 01:04:58,955
I think he'S Still under
the wrong impreSSion.

648
01:04:59,662 --> 01:05:01,630
What wrong impreSSion?
- You know that.

649
01:05:02,331 --> 01:05:04,629
Only your father doeSn't know
that you're in love with sunder.

650
01:05:05,167 --> 01:05:08,466
What are you talking about?
- Do not be angry.

651
01:05:09,338 --> 01:05:12,637
sunder himSelf told me.
He loveS you very much.

652
01:05:13,175 --> 01:05:16,474
You muStn't defame a woman.

653
01:05:17,346 --> 01:05:21,806
If you don't want to marry me
you can Say you don't approve of me.

654
01:05:22,018 --> 01:05:23,986
I waS coming over becauSe
I approved of you.

655
01:05:24,854 --> 01:05:27,982
But when sunder told me...
- LieS! He haS told you lieS!

656
01:05:28,524 --> 01:05:29,991
I'll aSk him right now!

657
01:05:30,860 --> 01:05:34,819
How am I to blame if Someone
miStakeS my Sympathy for love?

658
01:05:35,031 --> 01:05:39,491
PleaSe Speak Softly. He Said
you told him that you like him.

659
01:05:39,869 --> 01:05:42,337
I did. I told him that
not once, but many timeS.

660
01:05:42,872 --> 01:05:50,176
I liked hiS innocence, hiS jokeS.
I Still like it.

661
01:05:50,713 --> 01:05:53,341
But that doeS not mean
I'm in love with him.

662
01:05:53,816 --> 01:05:58,515
He doeSn't know much of EngliSh.
He'S too Simple and naive.

663
01:05:58,988 --> 01:06:02,185
That'S exactly why I Showed
Some intereSt in him.

664
01:06:03,392 --> 01:06:07,351
You once met him at the reStaurant
and aSked him, "Are you married?"

665
01:06:07,730 --> 01:06:09,698
YeS, I did.

666
01:06:10,232 --> 01:06:15,192
I wondered how a poor
married man could be making out.

667
01:06:15,905 --> 01:06:18,032
You wanted him to make progreSS?
- Of courSe.

668
01:06:18,407 --> 01:06:20,375
I'm alSo reSponSible for
thiS miSunderStanding.

669
01:06:21,410 --> 01:06:24,208
He miStook Some thingS. And l
fed him Some more wrong notionS.

670
01:06:24,747 --> 01:06:27,875
But why blame me for it? I'll Sort
it out with him right now!

671
01:06:28,250 --> 01:06:31,549
No, Radha... it'll break hiS heart.

672
01:06:32,588 --> 01:06:37,389
The poor man adoreS you and he'S
trying to improve hiS StandardS...

673
01:06:37,526 --> 01:06:38,720
So he can be worthy of you.

674
01:06:38,928 --> 01:06:44,730
And he'll Surely make it big
Some day. He haS the confidence...

675
01:06:45,101 --> 01:06:48,559
and I have faith in him.
You are hiS well-wiSher too.

676
01:06:49,105 --> 01:06:54,907
Can't you change your Sympathy
into love for my Sake?

677
01:06:55,778 --> 01:07:00,579
You are truly sunder'S friend.
I reSpect your SentimentS.

678
01:07:01,283 --> 01:07:04,252
But why are you forgetting
that love happenS not on itS own...

679
01:07:04,954 --> 01:07:09,584
it iSn't induced on Someone'S Say So.
AS for SympathieS, I Still have them.

680
01:07:10,126 --> 01:07:12,754
I know that.
- What you perhapS don't know...

681
01:07:13,462 --> 01:07:15,589
iS that like sunder,
I have made miStake too.

682
01:07:16,298 --> 01:07:21,930
I Saw your photograph and when I got
to know that you were coming over...

683
01:07:22,972 --> 01:07:28,103
I took you for my own, without even
finding out how you felt about me.

684
01:07:28,477 --> 01:07:30,945
ThiS will kill sunder'S
aSpirationS, Radha.

685
01:07:31,647 --> 01:07:35,606
He haSn't any life without you.
- That'S my predicament, too.

686
01:07:35,985 --> 01:07:37,953
You can forget me
becauSe of your friend.

687
01:07:38,821 --> 01:07:40,789
But I cannot forget you
for anyone'S Sake.

688
01:07:42,658 --> 01:07:45,286
What am I to do? I'm caught between
the devil and the deep blue SeaS!

689
01:07:46,495 --> 01:07:49,293
sunder'S aSpirationS muStn't die
before they bloSSom.

690
01:07:50,332 --> 01:07:53,130
Can you do Something for me, Radha?
- I can even die for you...

691
01:07:53,836 --> 01:07:55,463
only don't aSk me to forget you.

692
01:07:56,672 --> 01:07:59,140
Till Such time aS
sunder iS SucceSSful...

693
01:07:59,842 --> 01:08:01,810
we muSt keep thiS
a Secret from him.

694
01:08:02,178 --> 01:08:04,146
BecauSe to have you iS
what giveS him courage.

695
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:08,639
It'S hiS Support and reaSon to live.
- He will get to know Some day.

696
01:08:09,185 --> 01:08:12,484
Won't he Say I have cheated
and betrayed him?

697
01:08:12,955 --> 01:08:16,322
He'll have a Stronger heart by then.
He'll develop the will to bear it.

698
01:08:16,859 --> 01:08:20,659
The dazzle of fame and SucceSS might
leSSen the paSSionS that rage in him.

699
01:08:21,030 --> 01:08:22,998
We will then diScloSe it to him.

700
01:08:23,199 --> 01:08:26,657
It'll be a favour to me, Radha.
Not to sunder.

701
01:08:27,203 --> 01:08:28,830
"No dearth of SpoonS (SycophantS)..."

702
01:08:29,205 --> 01:08:31,173
"look for you, you will
find thouSandS"

703
01:08:36,579 --> 01:08:38,547
"Here comeS the Storm"

704
01:08:41,717 --> 01:08:46,177
The two of you are So Silent.
And I aSked you to have a chat.

705
01:08:47,056 --> 01:08:52,187
Radhaji, thiS iS the firSt
Sweet day in my life.

706
01:08:52,728 --> 01:08:55,356
And it'S all thankS
to my friend, Amar.

707
01:08:55,731 --> 01:08:57,699
Have Some...
you, too, Amar.

708
01:08:59,902 --> 01:09:03,861
How about you?
- Not me...

709
01:09:04,073 --> 01:09:07,531
I've Sweetened my tongue with the joy!
I'll be happier to See you eat it.

710
01:09:10,412 --> 01:09:15,042
You muSt have Some from thiS.
- In that caSe, wait a minute.

711
01:09:25,594 --> 01:09:28,563
You've both given me So much.
It'S going to be too much of Sweet.

712
01:09:29,098 --> 01:09:31,066
No, not too much of Sweet.

713
01:09:32,268 --> 01:09:39,401
Take what I give you to be bland.
- I'll be reSponSible for that too.

714
01:09:39,942 --> 01:09:42,740
I'm the one who made it.
- The one who eatS...

715
01:09:42,878 --> 01:09:44,743
can be reSponSible, too.
He can alSo make miStakeS.

716
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:48,077
No. It could be the ignorance
of the one who makeS it.

717
01:09:48,450 --> 01:09:52,250
Or it could be Sheer haSte...
- No, sunder. It'S deliciouS.

718
01:09:52,788 --> 01:09:55,757
I made it in the hope
that you would like it.

719
01:09:56,458 --> 01:09:57,425
Eat.

720
01:10:01,130 --> 01:10:03,098
I muSt leave, sunder.
- Give that to me.

721
01:13:55,030 --> 01:13:56,998
Radha, dear...
- Father!

722
01:13:57,866 --> 01:14:02,826
I'm glad to See you happy today.
- I met Amar, father...

723
01:14:03,205 --> 01:14:05,002
he'S coming to See you.

724
01:14:05,207 --> 01:14:07,004
He had a reaSon for not
turning up the other day.

725
01:14:07,276 --> 01:14:09,506
Where did you meet him?
- That waiter sunder, you know?

726
01:14:10,045 --> 01:14:12,843
He haS got a role in a film.
He haS become an actor.

727
01:14:13,382 --> 01:14:16,351
I went to congratulate him and
met Amar at hiS place.

728
01:14:16,885 --> 01:14:21,015
He'S sunder'S true friend, father.
And he wantS to marry me.

729
01:14:21,223 --> 01:14:24,021
so the two of you have even
finaliSed your wedding?

730
01:14:24,726 --> 01:14:28,025
Oh no, father. I won't do
anything againSt your wiSheS.

731
01:14:28,564 --> 01:14:31,032
suppoSe I Say...
"You can't marry Amar"

732
01:14:33,235 --> 01:14:35,863
I know. My father would
never Say Such a thing.

733
01:14:37,239 --> 01:14:39,207
I See!

734
01:14:47,082 --> 01:14:51,883
Where are you going all dreSSed up?
- I'm going to work.

735
01:14:52,421 --> 01:14:55,390
so why put on airS? You're going
to the reStaurant, aren't you?

736
01:14:55,591 --> 01:14:58,560
Oh no. I've become
a film actor, you See.

737
01:15:04,933 --> 01:15:08,391
Want Some money for buttermilk?
- No, my Stomach iS full already.

738
01:15:08,770 --> 01:15:11,568
sunder... no!
Brother-dear...

739
01:15:12,608 --> 01:15:16,066
Brother-dear? What'S the new name for?
- BecauSe you have become an actor.

740
01:15:16,612 --> 01:15:19,410
May your filmS turn out
to be Silver jubilee runnerS!

741
01:15:19,781 --> 01:15:22,579
May you achieve SucceSS.
And may I grow in Stature too.

742
01:15:23,452 --> 01:15:26,080
All right. I muSt leave.
The director wantS me in early.

743
01:15:26,288 --> 01:15:30,247
Brother-dear... where the Star goeS,
the Sychophant followS him.

744
01:15:31,126 --> 01:15:33,754
What doeS that mean?

745
01:15:33,896 --> 01:15:35,420

746
01:15:55,651 --> 01:15:57,949

747
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:03,121
New face, eh? I wonder which
SpecieS you belong to.

748
01:16:04,326 --> 01:16:06,794

You've made a grindStone

01:16:14,670 --> 01:16:20,472
I've created So many StarS thiS way.
I'll make you too.

752
01:16:26,014 --> 01:16:27,811
You're Sure going

753
01:16:34,189 --> 01:16:37,647
I'm here, Sir.
- so? Go on in there!

754
01:16:39,528 --> 01:16:42,986
What are you looking at?
- I waS told...

755
01:16:43,365 --> 01:16:45,833
that I'd deliver my lineS Standing
in a hall on the firSt floor.

756
01:16:46,368 --> 01:16:48,836
But there iSn't a roof here...
no StepS either. Where'S firSt floor?

757
01:16:49,071 --> 01:16:53,167
You let your tongue run away with

758
01:16:58,714 --> 01:16:59,840
Idiot!

759
01:17:00,215 --> 01:17:01,682
Director Saab...
- That'S him.

760
01:17:01,883 --> 01:17:06,183
Don't you know, I'm the director?
Okay. It'll do.

761
01:17:07,389 --> 01:17:08,356
Do what, Sir?

762
01:17:08,557 --> 01:17:11,185
They piled the greaSepaint on me.

Will do. Have you made him

01:17:15,564 --> 01:17:18,032
YeS, Sir.

The dreamgirl!

01:17:28,243 --> 01:17:30,211

768
01:17:30,412 --> 01:17:35,714
You give break to theSe new guyS
and they feed on uS!

769
01:17:35,917 --> 01:17:39,546
I only feed on vegetableS, lady.
- Poor chap iS a new actor.

770
01:17:39,921 --> 01:17:43,379
He haS the fire in him.

You're the one I'm talking to.
Come here.

773
01:17:56,605 --> 01:18:01,065
Let not the fact that you're working
with a big Star intimidate you.

774
01:18:01,943 --> 01:18:05,572
And you muStn't let the fact that
you're working with a new actor...

775
01:18:05,781 --> 01:18:07,248
make you meSS up your lineS.

776
01:18:11,453 --> 01:18:15,082
Director! I know thiS woman!
she'S the one with the whiSkerS!

777
01:18:15,624 --> 01:18:18,593
WhiSkerS? Where are they?
- Not on her face.

778
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:22,589
KidS draw whiSkerS on her face
on the poSterS in town.

779
01:18:22,964 --> 01:18:29,267
You're playing a Servant, sunder.
And madam iS the maid-Servant.

780
01:18:30,639 --> 01:18:33,437
The two of you...

01:18:33,642 --> 01:18:36,770
You're in love.
- Love? With her?

01:18:37,646 --> 01:18:39,614
All right. I'm SuppoSed to be
in love with the maid Servant.

783
01:18:39,748 --> 01:18:41,443
Let'S have a rehearSal.

01:18:43,819 --> 01:18:45,787
something wrong with your make up.

785
01:18:48,156 --> 01:18:51,125
It'S okay.

I haven't had anything, Sir.
May I have a glaSS of water?

794
01:19:24,693 --> 01:19:28,652
Don't you even get water at home?

I make it before the camera...

804
01:20:09,070 --> 01:20:12,699
and he waveS a board in my face!
- ldiot! That'S how filmS are made.

805
01:20:13,074 --> 01:20:14,871
It'll be removed when the
camera getS rolling.

01:20:15,076 --> 01:20:17,874
And you muSt Start Speaking

You are Sweeter than

01:20:32,260 --> 01:20:35,559
Your eyeS are intoxicating.

With your permiSSion, I could

Go on. I'm not going to

814
01:20:54,282 --> 01:20:56,750
I am not longing for you.

815
01:20:57,619 --> 01:21:00,247
I am not pining for you.

816
01:21:00,622 --> 01:21:04,251
No love for you...
underStand?

817
01:21:06,962 --> 01:21:09,430

We're making a Hindi film, madam.

819
01:21:12,634 --> 01:21:14,602
ThiS iS not a co-production.

I Spoke my lineS in Hindi.
- But your accent waS EngliSh!

You need to Speak proper Hindi.
You're playing a maidServant.

01:21:24,312 --> 01:21:29,944
You may Speak only EngliSh in

823
01:21:30,151 --> 01:21:32,449
But in my filmS, you muSt

01:21:32,654 --> 01:21:34,622
Go and give that Shot.

826
01:22:00,849 --> 01:22:03,977
Very angry, are you?
- No. I'm thrilled.

827
01:22:04,519 --> 01:22:06,987
Why are you So late?
- I went to See sunder.

828
01:22:07,522 --> 01:22:09,149

Really?

831
01:22:14,029 --> 01:22:17,328
You are the one reSponSible for
sunder'S proSperity, Radha.

832
01:22:17,799 --> 01:22:20,324
How come? I did juSt

833
01:22:20,702 --> 01:22:23,170
How can I ever thank you?
- Never mind that...

834
01:22:23,705 --> 01:22:25,673
or I'll get bogged down
under the weight!

835
01:22:27,375 --> 01:22:29,343
Look at what I've brought for you.

836
01:22:37,385 --> 01:22:43,187
Wow! You look So handSome.

837
01:22:53,735 --> 01:22:57,535
ThankS for your help, Mr Elephant.

838
01:28:42,917 --> 01:28:44,885

844
01:29:05,940 --> 01:29:08,408
What are you reading, Amar?
- Babuji? Welcome.

845
01:29:09,110 --> 01:29:10,236
sit down.

846
01:29:10,445 --> 01:29:17,408
I wrote to your father to fix a
date for your wedding with Radha.

847
01:29:18,119 --> 01:29:19,746
He haS left the deciSion to you.

848
01:29:20,121 --> 01:29:23,090
I came here So we could fix
a date for the wedding.

849
01:29:23,958 --> 01:29:27,587
I had told you of
my reSolve earlier, Babuji.

850
01:29:28,129 --> 01:29:29,756
Once I have achieved that,
we can fix the wedding date.

851
01:29:30,231 --> 01:29:31,425
What have you reSolved?

852
01:29:33,134 --> 01:29:36,103
CongratulationS, sunder!

853
01:29:36,637 --> 01:29:39,435
Every paper haS
laviShed praiSe on you.

854
01:29:39,640 --> 01:29:42,939
But I'm Scared. They've made
So much out of the film.

855
01:29:43,311 --> 01:29:45,108
I think the ScribeS
have gone overboard.

856
01:29:45,313 --> 01:29:46,780
Who iS thiS gentleman?

857
01:29:47,982 --> 01:29:51,440
You, Sir? Forgive me!
I Sat down without looking at you.

858
01:29:51,819 --> 01:29:54,617
You are Said to be
a good actor, sunder.

859
01:29:55,156 --> 01:29:56,453
That'S what the paperS Say.

860
01:29:56,591 --> 01:29:59,151
But I'm not acting when
I Seek your bleSSingS.

861
01:29:59,494 --> 01:30:03,123
You have my bleSSingS, sunder.
You muSt Scale greater heightS.

862
01:30:03,831 --> 01:30:07,289
How will l, unleSS I get up?
My kneeS are aching.

863
01:30:08,669 --> 01:30:10,136
Get up.

864
01:30:10,505 --> 01:30:13,633
You are the Same man, sunder.
You have juSt not changed.

865
01:30:14,175 --> 01:30:15,972
sit down.
- I'm okay, Sir.

866
01:30:16,177 --> 01:30:18,145
sit down.

867
01:30:18,346 --> 01:30:21,144
What bringS you here, Sir?
Do you know Amar?

868
01:30:21,516 --> 01:30:26,317
HaSn't Amar told you? He'S...
- I had Something to tell you, sunder.

869
01:30:26,521 --> 01:30:28,148
Later. Let my boSS finiSh firSt.

870
01:30:28,356 --> 01:30:29,983
YeS, Sir?
- That'S juSt what I'm Saying.

871
01:30:30,191 --> 01:30:33,991
Correct. You had better tell him.
I muSt leave now.

872
01:30:34,862 --> 01:30:37,990
I know you don't like to go
to the movieS, Sir.

873
01:30:38,366 --> 01:30:42,325
But you muSt Surely See my film.
- I will, sunder. I Surely will.

874
01:30:45,373 --> 01:30:47,341
What happened?
- see, Amar?

875
01:30:48,042 --> 01:30:52,342
A nice tree bearing nice fruitS.
My father-in-law'S a nice man...

876
01:30:53,881 --> 01:30:57,009
So iS my Radha.
By the way...

877
01:30:57,385 --> 01:30:59,012
how do you know thiS gentleman?

878
01:31:00,721 --> 01:31:02,689
I met him juSt aS you met him.

879
01:31:03,391 --> 01:31:05,359
You went to hiS eatery
without any money?

880
01:31:05,560 --> 01:31:10,020
How many diSheS did you waSh?
- I managed it Somehow.

881
01:31:15,403 --> 01:31:18,702
ThiS iS her Snap. I alwayS keep it
cloSe to my heart, Amar.

882
01:31:19,407 --> 01:31:21,534
I'm dying to tell her how I feel.

883
01:31:21,909 --> 01:31:25,538
HaS Radha expreSSed
her love for you?

884
01:31:26,414 --> 01:31:28,211
No.
- Have you?

885
01:31:28,416 --> 01:31:32,216
Never. But I now want to tell her.
- Not right yet, sunder.

886
01:31:33,254 --> 01:31:35,222
TheSe rich men encourage only
people of their own StatuS.

887
01:31:36,257 --> 01:31:38,225
It'd be better if you firSt
equal them in termS of wealth.

888
01:31:38,593 --> 01:31:40,561
I muSt leave now.
I have a Shoot.

889
01:32:04,118 --> 01:32:08,077
You go to the market with her and
happen to buy more than neceSSary.

890
01:32:08,789 --> 01:32:12,748
You're carrying the whole Stuff.
You haven't found a coolie around.

891
01:32:13,961 --> 01:32:20,264
On your way, there iS a Storm
and it StartS pouring heavily.

892
01:32:20,801 --> 01:32:23,770
When doeS the Storm Start?
- When I want it to.

893
01:32:24,972 --> 01:32:26,940
You will have thiS umbrella.

894
01:32:28,643 --> 01:32:32,101
should sunder alSo carry the
umbrella with the other Stuff...

895
01:32:32,313 --> 01:32:37,444
wouldn't that be a better touch?
sunder grappling with the Stuff...

896
01:32:37,818 --> 01:32:41,948
and the umbrella will give it
that extra bit of comedy.

897
01:32:42,490 --> 01:32:44,458
Good idea!

898
01:32:45,660 --> 01:32:47,628
The umbrella will go haywire...

899
01:32:48,329 --> 01:32:50,297
Take your poSitionS.

900
01:33:11,352 --> 01:33:15,482
Don't be afraid. I might be an
old man, but I'll take you through.

901
01:33:15,856 --> 01:33:17,824
Come rain, come Storm...

902
01:33:24,031 --> 01:33:26,659

903
01:33:28,269 --> 01:33:30,237
Where are you?

904
01:33:31,038 --> 01:33:33,836
Where are you, dear?
- Where are you?

905
01:33:34,709 --> 01:33:37,678
I'm right here!

906
01:33:38,212 --> 01:33:42,171
Right here, darling! You've fallen.
How can I remain Standing?

907
01:33:42,550 --> 01:33:45,678
I'm bothering you So much...

908
01:33:46,220 --> 01:33:49,849
Don't worry, darling.
I'll take you home.

909
01:33:51,225 --> 01:33:52,852
God!

910
01:33:53,060 --> 01:33:56,860

01:34:34,602 --> 01:34:37,571
A thouSand ShareS in Mahalaxmi

916
01:34:37,772 --> 01:34:40,570
I aSked you to buy 500. Not 1000.
Go on.

917

Your EngliSh teacher iS here.

921
01:34:55,790 --> 01:34:59,590
That'S not your look-out. Meet my
Solicitor USman Palkiwala.

922
01:34:59,794 --> 01:35:02,422
That guy haSn't reSponded for

923
01:35:02,963 --> 01:35:08,924
Oh yeS. Know what? Convert that

01:43:27,301 --> 01:43:30,600
The driverS have left, madam.

970
01:43:31,138 --> 01:43:33,106
No. You may go.

971
01:43:34,975 --> 01:43:36,943
Move back... pleaSe. Go away.

972

On behalf of the ASSociation,
I preSent thiS trophy to Mr sunder.

973
01:43:52,326 --> 01:43:55,295

978
01:44:15,182 --> 01:44:17,150
There iS Someone who gave me the

01:44:18,518 --> 01:44:19,985
"l like your innocence"

980

My friend Amar gave me the meanS
to expreSS mySelf.

981
01:44:23,523 --> 01:44:26,321
And you, loverS of cinema,
appreciated my work.

982
01:44:26,860 --> 01:44:28,828
Had I not been given
the meanS...

983
01:44:29,363 --> 01:44:32,491
thiS waiter in a reStaurant
would have remained a waiter.

984
01:44:35,369 --> 01:44:38,167
All of you are reSponSible
for the progreSS I have made.

985
01:44:38,705 --> 01:44:41,674
It'S not me who iS worthy
of the garlandS, you are.

986
01:44:42,709 --> 01:44:45,837
BecauSe for all the fame, reSpect

987
01:44:46,213 --> 01:44:49,182

Glory to lndia!

991
01:45:39,099 --> 01:45:41,397
Wait there! Come no further.

992
01:45:45,772 --> 01:45:49,401
What'S all thiS, ma?
- I'm warding off the evil eye.

993
01:45:50,110 --> 01:45:52,908
All SortS of people muSt

994
01:45:53,613 --> 01:45:55,740
Their eyeS were popping out.

995
01:45:56,283 --> 01:45:59,252
You weren't preSent there, ma.
How would you know?

996
01:45:59,453 --> 01:46:01,580
I've Seen and heard everything.

997
01:46:02,456 --> 01:46:04,424
Did you get the divine viSion
Sitting here at home?

998
01:46:04,624 --> 01:46:06,421
All right, tell me...
what did I Say at the function?

999
01:46:06,960 --> 01:46:12,091

1012
01:47:03,183 --> 01:47:07,813
But I'm afraid. In the dazzle
of the arc-lightS...

1013
01:47:08,522 --> 01:47:12,481
and fame, I hope you aren't
Separated from me.

1014
01:47:13,193 --> 01:47:14,319
Why Say Such thingS, ma?

1015
01:47:14,694 --> 01:47:16,821
JuSt aS a blind man preServeS
hiS walking Stick...

1016
01:47:17,864 --> 01:47:22,995
motherS alwayS want their children

01:47:25,539 --> 01:47:26,506
Look at thiS.

1021
01:47:46,726 --> 01:47:50,025
Daata'S here to take me away.
Go away, Daata!

1022
01:47:51,398 --> 01:47:56,358
Daata can't Separate me from you.
But...

1023
01:47:58,071 --> 01:48:00,539
All artiStS are going out for a week.
- What for?

1024
01:48:00,907 --> 01:48:04,365
We're organiSing programmeS to raiSe
fundS for orphanS and poor children.

1025
01:48:05,245 --> 01:48:09,375
It won't be right if every other

1029
01:48:18,758 --> 01:48:22,387
It'S father'S death anniverSary.

1030
01:48:22,762 --> 01:48:25,560
He'll be here to make arrangementS.
And I'll return well in time.

1031
01:48:26,099 --> 01:48:28,567
It'S night time. ASk the driver
to drive Slowly.

1032
01:48:28,768 --> 01:48:32,397
Don't worry, ma. Your Son
iS cloSe with you.

1033
01:48:33,607 --> 01:48:38,567
For handicapped children and orphanS,
an entertainment Show by film StarS.

1034
01:48:45,952 --> 01:48:47,920
shut up!

1035
01:48:48,288 --> 01:48:51,257
ThiS iS the SkieS, not the earth
where you can fight like animalS!

1036
01:48:51,625 --> 01:48:54,594
Anymore miSchief from you and
I'll hand you over to God.

1037
01:48:55,128 --> 01:48:58,427
Form a queue here like we do
for the rationS on earth. Go on.

1038
01:48:58,798 --> 01:49:00,766
Like we aSk for rice... Go on.

1039
01:49:04,304 --> 01:49:06,431
- UndiSciplined kidS!
Fold your handS to the Lord!

1040
01:49:07,974 --> 01:49:10,772
Lord, what crowd do we have
at KailaSh today?

1041
01:50:39,566 --> 01:50:41,534
Tell the Lord their nameS.

1042
01:50:42,235 --> 01:50:44,203
Lord, they are...

1043
01:50:53,913 --> 01:50:57,542
I'm carrying November in my armS,
and December'S in my womb.

1044
01:50:58,184 --> 01:51:02,382
so many children in a Single family?

1045
01:51:04,591 --> 01:51:08,721
What am I to do, Lord...?
They're what You gave me.

1046
01:53:07,714 --> 01:53:09,682
What happened?

1047
01:53:10,216 --> 01:53:13,185
No more children, pleaSe!
- Very well!

1048
01:53:13,720 --> 01:53:15,688
Lord!

1049
01:53:17,557 --> 01:53:20,526
How are we to eScape
the population exploSion?

1050
01:53:21,060 --> 01:53:25,360
Why don't You aSk Lord Brahma to
put a halt on babieS for Some dayS.

1051
01:53:26,399 --> 01:53:29,527
How can that be?
- I have an idea, Lord.

1052
01:53:30,570 --> 01:53:32,538
Not only will it control
the population...

1053
01:53:32,739 --> 01:53:35,708
but babieS will be born
in 18 monthS and not 9.

1054
01:53:38,411 --> 01:53:40,879
Why are you crying?
- 18 monthS, did you Say?

1055
01:53:41,247 --> 01:53:43,215
What are women going
to be Subjected to?

1056
01:53:43,583 --> 01:53:45,551
Why don't you men take
the burden of childbirth?

1057
01:53:45,919 --> 01:53:48,717
No thank you!
PleaSe Spare me the labour painS!

1058
01:53:48,922 --> 01:53:50,890
Lord, pleaSe SuggeSt Something.

1059
01:53:51,424 --> 01:53:56,555
It'S like thiS. There iS no need
to change the lawS of nature.

1060
01:53:58,097 --> 01:54:01,897
BecauSe the Lord haS already
granted man the boon of abundance.

1061
01:54:03,436 --> 01:54:06,894
should man decide to
lead hiS life carefully...

1062
01:54:07,941 --> 01:54:10,068
he will Surely have
happineSS and peace.

1063
01:54:10,777 --> 01:54:14,907
I don't underStand, Lord.
- Don't you?

1064
01:54:16,449 --> 01:54:18,417
Very well. You will
underStand it now.

1065
01:54:23,122 --> 01:54:26,250
Look at them.
The model family.

1066
01:54:27,794 --> 01:54:29,921
Only two children... How?

1067
01:54:30,630 --> 01:54:31,597
Take thiS.

1068
01:54:34,133 --> 01:54:38,092
Family planning.
- Family planning?

1069
01:54:39,138 --> 01:54:41,106
PraiSe the Lord!

1070
01:55:41,868 --> 01:55:44,166
Welcome.
- GreetingS, Mr sunder.

1071

With your help, our organiSation

1072
01:55:49,042 --> 01:55:51,510
No programme haS fetched uS
Such great returnS.

1073
01:55:52,045 --> 01:55:55,173
They're children in the orphanage.
- They're So very innocent.

1074
01:55:58,217 --> 01:56:00,185
ThiS iS for you, Uncle.

1075
01:56:01,721 --> 01:56:06,181
There waS only one man (Nehru) worthy
of thiS roSe... it iSn't me, Son.

1076
01:56:07,060 --> 01:56:11,190
But remember. My life will be
dedicated to your cauSe.

1077
01:56:12,065 --> 01:56:18,368
Do another Show for uS, uncle.
- stay over for another day, pleaSe.

1078
01:56:18,571 --> 01:56:20,539
PleaSe help uS, uncle.

1079
01:56:24,911 --> 01:56:29,541
What iS it, dear? speak up.
- she can't Speak, Mr sunder.

1080
01:56:30,249 --> 01:56:31,876
she'S dumb.

1081
01:56:33,419 --> 01:56:36,547
What iS thiS...?
"Do another Show for uS, uncle"

1082
01:56:37,256 --> 01:56:39,224
My dear child!

1083
01:56:39,592 --> 01:56:44,222
God made you Such a lovable child...
but He haSn't been juSt to you.

1084
01:56:45,098 --> 01:56:49,057
I will certainly do another Show
for you. Tommorrow itSelf.

1085
01:56:53,940 --> 01:56:55,908
Here you are.

1086
01:56:59,445 --> 01:57:04,075
Telephone exchange? PleaSe try
again. It'S very important.

1087
01:57:05,785 --> 01:57:07,912
What...? The lineS are dead?

1088
01:57:09,455 --> 01:57:12,424
But pleaSe try again.
Okay.

1089
01:57:22,802 --> 01:57:25,930
He Said he'd be here to perform the
riteS for hiS father'S ceremony.

1090
01:57:26,806 --> 01:57:28,774
He'S getting to be
So very careleSS.

1091
01:57:30,643 --> 01:57:34,101
Don't worry, ma. He'll come.
He Surely will.

1092
01:57:34,647 --> 01:57:36,274
I'll give it another try.

1093
01:57:47,660 --> 01:57:50,788
Ma! Our programme waS

1094
01:57:50,997 --> 01:57:53,966
People praiSed me So much!
I waS felicitated again!

1095
01:57:54,667 --> 01:57:57,966
Why are you quiet, ma?

1096
01:57:58,671 --> 01:58:01,299
what more could you want?
- What a thing to Say, ma!

1097
01:58:01,507 --> 01:58:02,633
Brother-dear...
- What iS it?

1098
01:58:02,842 --> 01:58:06,471
It waS your father'S ceremony.
- Why didn't you telephone me?

1099
01:58:06,846 --> 01:58:09,815
We tried So many timeS.
The lineS were dead.

1100
01:58:10,850 --> 01:58:15,150
Ma, what am I to do...?
I juSt couldn't remember.

1101
01:58:15,521 --> 01:58:18,649
JuSt becauSe you are SucceSSful,
Should you be reminded...

1102
01:58:18,858 --> 01:58:23,318
who your parentS are?
You have Some duty towardS them.

1103
01:58:24,030 --> 01:58:27,659
If you can't Spend a day in a year
in memory of your father...

1104
01:58:28,201 --> 01:58:31,170
what good iS your fame and money?

1105
01:58:31,871 --> 01:58:36,831
Do you know how hurt I am
at your indifference?

1106
01:58:37,043 --> 01:58:39,341
Forgive me, ma.

1107
01:58:40,546 --> 01:58:43,174
The tearS of thoSe
innocent little children...

1108
01:58:43,883 --> 01:58:48,013
made me forget my dutieS.
In my zeSt to help them...

1109
01:58:48,154 --> 01:58:51,419
I forgot I had to be home to perform
the riteS for my father'S ceremony.

1110
01:58:51,557 --> 01:58:53,525
Forgive me, ma.

1111
01:58:53,893 --> 01:58:59,695
If you were there for the
Sake of deStitute children...

1112
01:59:01,234 --> 01:59:03,361
there can be no bigger
ceremony than that, my Son.

1113
01:59:03,903 --> 01:59:06,531
You're So very great, ma.

1114
01:59:07,740 --> 01:59:14,543
Never forget how helpleSS a
mother iS without her Son.

1115
01:59:16,415 --> 01:59:20,715
I want nothing elSe...
I have juSt one wiSh.

1116
01:59:21,087 --> 01:59:22,054
What iS it, ma?

1117
01:59:22,922 --> 01:59:27,552
I want to die in my Son'S armS.
That'S all I wiSh for.

1118
01:59:29,262 --> 01:59:32,060
Don't be far away from me
when I'm dying, my Son.

1119
01:59:33,099 --> 01:59:35,067
What thingS are you Saying, ma?

1120
01:59:36,102 --> 01:59:39,731
silly boy. No one iS immortal.

1121
01:59:40,439 --> 01:59:45,741
You will fulfill my wiSh, won't you?
- Fulfill my wiSh firSt.

1122
01:59:46,946 --> 01:59:50,746
You will get a Slap if
you Say Something Silly.

1123
01:59:51,284 --> 01:59:54,082
No Slap. I'm going to eat Some
Stale bread made by you.

1124
01:59:54,287 --> 01:59:56,255
sit down here.

1125
02:00:08,134 --> 02:00:13,265
Here you are, ma.
- You Said Stale-bread...

1126
02:00:13,806 --> 02:00:15,774
but you've even brought it
in the old plate.

1127
02:00:16,475 --> 02:00:19,444
Why do you love theSe
old thingS So much?

1128
02:00:19,979 --> 02:00:24,939
You're old too, ma.
MuSt I forget my ma then?

1129
02:00:25,818 --> 02:00:27,786
Feed me Some, ma.

1130
02:00:33,826 --> 02:00:35,794

1132
02:00:49,342 --> 02:00:51,810

1133
02:00:51,944 --> 02:00:55,141
she wantS an interview.
- PleaSe Sit down.

1134
02:00:56,682 --> 02:01:03,144
I won't waSte your time, Mr sunder.
I know time iS preciouS for you.

1135
02:01:04,190 --> 02:01:07,318
May I aSk you Some queStionS.
- sure, pleaSe go ahead.

1136
02:01:12,531 --> 02:01:14,658
If you don't mind, could you
tell uS your age?

1137
02:01:16,035 --> 02:01:21,496
You muStn't aSk film artiStS
their age. That'S becauSe...

1138
02:01:21,641 --> 02:01:24,667
all lead-ladieS Still
call themSelveS "baby"...

1139
02:01:24,877 --> 02:01:26,344
So all the lead-actorS
are Still little kidS.

1140
02:01:27,713 --> 02:01:29,180
How far have you Studied?

1141
02:01:29,382 --> 02:01:31,850
That'S Something I will
whiSper in your earS.

1142
02:01:32,385 --> 02:01:36,845
BecauSe no School in lndia haS
the recordS of my StudieS.

1143
02:01:38,057 --> 02:01:40,025
I'm an actor, you See.

1144
02:01:41,560 --> 02:01:46,520
What difference do you find in
your earlier life and now?

1145
02:01:47,066 --> 02:01:50,365
The anSwer to your queStion
iS there on that wall.

1146
02:01:51,404 --> 02:01:56,535
I waS an ugly looking man.
I alwayS hung my head in Shame.

1147
02:01:57,076 --> 02:02:00,204
I became a waiter in an eatery.
And then, thankS to my friend...

1148
02:02:00,346 --> 02:02:05,045
and the film induStry, I became an
actor. And then a Star. A top Star.

1149
02:02:05,751 --> 02:02:09,710
And here I am, before you.
The only difference iS that...

1150
02:02:10,256 --> 02:02:12,554
I uSed to make people laugh earlier
without charging them for it.

1151
02:02:12,925 --> 02:02:16,725
And today, I charge them money
to try and make them laugh.

1152
02:02:19,098 --> 02:02:22,898
Could you tell uS of the difficultieS
you faced in your earlier dayS?

1153
02:02:24,437 --> 02:02:26,735
Difficulty iS like a Small Stone.

1154
02:02:27,273 --> 02:02:31,733
Hold it cloSe to your eye,
it'll appear to be a mountain.

1155
02:02:32,445 --> 02:02:37,075
Look at from a diStance,
it appearS to be Small.

1156
02:02:38,117 --> 02:02:41,575
Trample it under your feet...
it remainS hidden.

1157
02:02:42,621 --> 02:02:44,589
Difficulty iS what
one makeS out of it.

1158
02:02:44,957 --> 02:02:49,257
Good! Do you ever remember the
dayS you Spent aS a waiter?

1159
02:02:49,628 --> 02:02:52,096
I can't ever forget thoSe dayS.
I never will.

1160
02:02:52,298 --> 02:02:54,266
Which iS why...

1161
02:02:57,470 --> 02:02:59,438
Where'S my uniform of the waiter
that waS hanging on the wall?

1162
02:02:59,638 --> 02:03:03,938
That uniform looked very obScene
on the grand wall.

1163
02:03:04,143 --> 02:03:06,270
I had it removed.
- shut up and put it back there!

1164
02:03:06,645 --> 02:03:08,613
Do it.

1165
02:03:10,316 --> 02:03:13,945
Madam, aS long aS that uniform
remainS in Sight...

1166
02:03:14,987 --> 02:03:19,447
I'm not fazed by my wealth.
I'm free of any arrogance.

1167
02:03:20,326 --> 02:03:25,286
Whenever I look down upon the
uniform I once uSed to wear...

1168
02:03:26,165 --> 02:03:28,963
do you know what anSwer
I get from the uniform?

1169
02:03:29,835 --> 02:03:33,635
It SayS, "lt'S becauSe you wore me
that you have theSe clotheS today"

1170
02:03:34,340 --> 02:03:36,808
That uniform doeS not let me
forget my paSt.

1171
02:03:37,610 --> 02:03:41,137
I had promiSed ma that I'd never
change even if I made it big.

1172
02:03:41,847 --> 02:03:44,315
That iS the uniform which remindS
me of the promiSe I made to her.

1173
02:03:45,184 --> 02:03:47,982
sorry, I remember my mother
now that I Speak of her.

1174
02:03:48,354 --> 02:03:50,481

I'll get married. Very Soon.

1178
02:03:59,865 --> 02:04:05,167
For your information that'S a very
beautiful part of my life.

1179
02:04:06,038 --> 02:04:09,337

AS you know...

1180
02:04:09,708 --> 02:04:13,337

Pray for me...

Well? Will I have to beg for

1201
02:05:43,802 --> 02:05:46,430
I have alwayS been your

Well, all right.

Radha, sunder iS coming

1205
02:06:00,653 --> 02:06:03,781
We made a miStake by hiding
the truth from him all theSe dayS.

1206
02:06:04,323 --> 02:06:07,622
You muSt tell him everything
before he comeS to me.

1207
02:06:08,160 --> 02:06:10,128
Where will I bring the courage from?

1208
02:06:10,362 --> 02:06:12,330
I waS Silent all theSe dayS,
becauSe you aSked me to.

1209
02:06:12,831 --> 02:06:15,129
I had Sealed my lipS for the
Sake of my friendShip.

1210
02:06:15,501 --> 02:06:18,629
If sunder were to aSk me...

1211
02:06:19,171 --> 02:06:22,800
if I can't Sacrifice my love
for hiS Sake...

1212
02:06:24,009 --> 02:06:28,639
I won't be able to refuSe him.
I don't have the courage to Say no!

1213
02:06:42,695 --> 02:06:45,664
sit down, sunder.
I want to talk to you.

1214
02:06:46,031 --> 02:06:49,660
I know what ma'S

1215
02:06:49,868 --> 02:06:52,336
You've heard about my love-marriage
on radio, didn't you?

1216
02:06:52,705 --> 02:06:55,833
That'S what I want to aSk you about.
- Every mother muSt aSk.

1217
02:06:56,208 --> 02:06:59,837
But there'S a method to that...
it muSt be done artiStically.

1218
02:07:00,379 --> 02:07:02,347
How about a rehearSal, ma?

1219
02:07:03,382 --> 02:07:06,180
How do I tranSlate that in Hindi?
How about faking it, ma?

1220
02:07:06,719 --> 02:07:09,847
All right.
- Now SuppoSe I'm the mother...

1221
02:07:10,556 --> 02:07:16,017
and I aSk, "Well, my boy?
since when have you been in love?"

1222
02:07:16,562 --> 02:07:18,689
Don't laugh. ASk it
the way I did.

1223
02:07:19,898 --> 02:07:24,858
since when have you been in love?
- Wow! That'S a nice act, ma!

1224
02:07:25,070 --> 02:07:28,699
And the Son then SpeakS...
- Why're you digging your noSe?

1225
02:07:28,907 --> 02:07:31,705
That'S how it workS nowadayS, ma.
ASk me the queStion again.

1226
02:07:32,411 --> 02:07:34,879
since when have you been

1227
02:07:35,080 --> 02:07:39,881
Ever Since we have Set eyeS
on each other, ma...

1228
02:07:40,919 --> 02:07:45,049
You go around eyeing girlS!
That'S my line, iSn't it?

1229
02:07:45,424 --> 02:07:48,882
YeS, but it'S only a rehearSal.
Go Slow on the Slap.

1230
02:07:49,428 --> 02:07:52,556
The Son then tellS hiS mother
in a quivering voice...

1231
02:07:52,765 --> 02:07:56,895
"I've been eyeing only one girl, ma"

1232
02:07:57,269 --> 02:08:00,568
And the mother SayS, "Are you
going to marry her?"

1233
02:08:00,939 --> 02:08:04,397
The Son SayS, "PleaSe give me
the permiSSion to marry her"

1234
02:08:05,110 --> 02:08:06,407
What doeS the mother Say?

1235
02:08:06,612 --> 02:08:09,740
And the Mother SayS, "Why tomorrow?
Get married to her today itSelf!"

1236
02:08:09,948 --> 02:08:13,748
But who'S the girl?
Where iS She from?

1237
02:08:15,621 --> 02:08:19,580
I'm not going to tell you that.
That'S the SuSpenSe.

1238
02:08:20,959 --> 02:08:24,417
All right. Now let'S begin
at the beginning.

1239
02:08:25,030 --> 02:08:28,261

1243
02:08:41,146 --> 02:08:45,105

1244
02:08:45,651 --> 02:08:50,111
so when are you marrying her?
- Marriage? Not yet, ma.

1245
02:08:51,490 --> 02:08:52,616
You won't?
- No.

1246
02:08:52,825 --> 02:08:57,455
so don't get married!
- Ma! We're only acting!

1247
02:08:58,163 --> 02:08:59,630
I'm Sunk!

1248
02:09:00,666 --> 02:09:02,634
Look! A film actor!

1249
02:09:09,675 --> 02:09:11,643
What a performance he gave
in "Biwi Ka Ghulam"

1250
02:09:20,018 --> 02:09:23,317
Hello, Radha.
- You...? Welcome! sit down.

1251
02:09:26,525 --> 02:09:28,493

- He haS gone out.

02:09:28,861 --> 02:09:31,659
I had Something to diScuSS with him.
I'll come again, when he'S around.

1253
02:09:32,030 --> 02:09:33,998
LiSten... what iS it?

1254
02:09:35,200 --> 02:09:37,327
How can I tell you when
we're all by ourSelveS?

1255
02:09:37,703 --> 02:09:41,662
It'S okay. Tell me.
- I've been dying to tell you.

1256
02:09:42,207 --> 02:09:45,176
And I've done So many Such
SceneS in filmS, Radha.

1257
02:09:45,544 --> 02:09:47,512
But every Scene waS cut
halfway through the act.

1258
02:09:48,046 --> 02:09:50,344
That'S how we laughed
when the director meSSed up.

1259
02:09:50,716 --> 02:09:53,344
AS I Said... what waS I Saying?

1260
02:09:54,887 --> 02:09:58,345
I can't bring to my lipS
how I feel at heart.

1261
02:09:58,724 --> 02:10:02,182
How will I tell you...? All right.
No beating about the buSh anymore.

1262
02:10:02,561 --> 02:10:04,529
I'll Say it Straightaway.

1263
02:10:05,731 --> 02:10:11,863
I've decided to get married, Radha.
- YeS. I heard that on radio.

1264
02:10:12,070 --> 02:10:14,368
You did? You heard
everything I Said?

1265
02:10:14,573 --> 02:10:18,373
That makeS it eaSy for me!
When I waS giving that interview...

1266
02:10:19,077 --> 02:10:24,379
I felt aS if I waS at the wedding
altar, dreSSed aS a bridegroom.

1267
02:10:24,917 --> 02:10:30,378
In theSe roSeS are my emotionS, Radha.
They carry the fragrance of my love.

1268
02:10:30,923 --> 02:10:33,721
I love you with all my heart...
here you are, Radha.

1269
02:10:34,927 --> 02:10:38,385
Do not be Shy. We love each other...

1270
02:10:39,598 --> 02:10:41,395
Why are you Silent?

1271
02:10:43,936 --> 02:10:45,904
No... No, Radha.

1272
02:10:47,272 --> 02:10:49,240
Don't turn me down
and break my heart.

1273
02:10:49,775 --> 02:10:52,903
No, sunder. ThiS can't be.
PleaSe forgive me.

1274
02:10:56,782 --> 02:11:01,742
I really liked your innocence
and the way you joked, sunder.

1275
02:11:02,788 --> 02:11:05,416
That'S exactly why
I fooled around with you.

1276
02:11:06,959 --> 02:11:09,257
It waS aS if I waS
talking to my brother...

1277
02:11:09,628 --> 02:11:15,430
and joking with him...
that waS the feeling I had, sunder.

1278
02:11:19,304 --> 02:11:22,102
I've never had a SiSter, Radha.

1279
02:11:22,808 --> 02:11:24,776
Maybe that iS why I couldn't
underStand how you felt.

1280
02:11:25,143 --> 02:11:30,103
But I can't believe thiS...
have I really miSunderStood you?

1281
02:11:30,649 --> 02:11:33,777
Have you never been in love with me?
- No, sunder. Never.

1282
02:11:33,986 --> 02:11:36,955
Don't Say that, Radha.
- I could never imagine...

1283
02:11:37,823 --> 02:11:40,951
that Such miSunderStandingS
would crop up...

1284
02:11:41,827 --> 02:11:43,795
if an unmarried girl
Spoke to a boy like thiS.

1285
02:11:44,329 --> 02:11:47,958
I didn't know that Such trivia
could cauSe you Such anguiSh!

1286
02:11:49,835 --> 02:11:53,134
I can See the conSequenceS
of my ignorance, sunder.

1287
02:11:53,672 --> 02:11:56,300
You're not the ignorant one, Radha.
It'S me.

1288
02:11:56,842 --> 02:11:59,140
No wonder my mother callS me a fool.

1289
02:12:00,178 --> 02:12:02,146
I muSt leave now, Radha.

1290
02:12:18,697 --> 02:12:22,497
I have no right to give you
theSe roSeS, Radha.

1291
02:12:23,869 --> 02:12:26,497
But if you don't mind...

1292
02:12:27,205 --> 02:12:29,503
keep theSe roSeS in Some
Secluded corner of the houSe.

1293
02:12:30,208 --> 02:12:31,835
Know why?

1294
02:12:32,210 --> 02:12:36,010
When I waS coming here happily
with theSe roSeS...

1295
02:12:37,215 --> 02:12:39,183
people outSide Saw me arrive.

1296
02:12:40,052 --> 02:12:43,681
How can I take back
thiS bouquet now?

1297
02:12:44,723 --> 02:12:49,023
They'll laugh at me.
They'll poke fun at my love.

1298
02:12:50,395 --> 02:12:52,363
And I can't bear
to See that happen.

1299
02:13:03,575 --> 02:13:07,204
I want to aSk you for
a little preSent, Radha.

1300
02:13:08,246 --> 02:13:11,704
You'll be amuSed to know what
thiS Silly man haS Sought from you.

1301
02:13:12,417 --> 02:13:15,545
It'S not extra-ordinary...
but it'S preciouS to me.

1302
02:13:15,921 --> 02:13:20,221
I want nothing much, Radha.
I want thiS waSte-paper baSket.

1303
02:13:20,759 --> 02:13:22,727
Know why?

1304
02:13:22,928 --> 02:13:25,556
Even if thoSe roSeS are proof
of my idiocacy to you...

1305
02:13:26,598 --> 02:13:31,058
for me, they are the reminder
of my firSt and only love.

1306
02:13:33,271 --> 02:13:35,899
I don't want them to end up
in thiS waSte-paper baSket.

1307
02:13:37,109 --> 02:13:39,077
so I'm taking thiS away.

1308
02:13:39,611 --> 02:13:43,069
What you are Saying iS
piercing my heart, sunder!

1309
02:13:43,782 --> 02:13:49,584
To hurt your feelingS iS
like killing mySelf, Radha.

1310
02:13:50,122 --> 02:13:53,250
I couldn't underStand
your feelingS...

1311
02:13:53,959 --> 02:13:55,756
that iSn't your miStake.
It'S mine.

1312
02:13:56,128 --> 02:14:02,089
I'm the cauSe of all thiS, sunder.
PleaSe forget all thiS.

1313
02:14:02,968 --> 02:14:07,598
What? Forget you...?
All right. I'll forget you.

1314
02:14:08,140 --> 02:14:11,598
And I have decided Something elSe.
something very terrible.

1315
02:14:12,811 --> 02:14:15,109
I'm going to die.
- No! Don't Say that, sunder!

1316
02:14:15,313 --> 02:14:19,943
I'll die... here and now...
or maybe 40 yearS later.

1317
02:14:20,819 --> 02:14:22,116
I made you laugh, didn't l?

1318
02:14:22,320 --> 02:14:27,280
I've made every man
laugh with my jokeS.

1319
02:14:28,660 --> 02:14:31,788
And now... I'm Sad mySelf.

1320
02:14:32,664 --> 02:14:35,633
To make mySelf laugh,
I'm cracking jokeS.

1321
02:14:36,001 --> 02:14:42,634
I got to know you love me the
day I viSited your houSe, sunder.

1322
02:14:43,175 --> 02:14:49,136
And I waS about to tell you clearly
that I am not in love with you.

1323
02:14:50,015 --> 02:14:52,813
But your friend Amar
Stopped me from telling you.

1324
02:14:53,518 --> 02:14:57,477
He didn't want you
to know the truth...

1325
02:14:58,023 --> 02:15:00,821
till you had achieved the
SucceSS you had Set out for.

1326
02:15:01,359 --> 02:15:03,987
What Amar Said waS right, Radha.

1327
02:15:05,030 --> 02:15:08,830
ThiS truth could perhapS have
killed me then.

1328
02:15:09,534 --> 02:15:11,661
I waSn't very Strong at heart.

1329
02:15:12,437 --> 02:15:15,167
I want to tell you
Something more, sunder.

1330
02:15:16,041 --> 02:15:18,339
It might hurt you when
you get to know.

1331
02:15:19,544 --> 02:15:23,674
I'm getting married to
your friend, Amar.

1332
02:15:25,050 --> 02:15:29,680
With Amar...?
CongratulationS, Radha!

1333
02:15:30,222 --> 02:15:34,352
I'm going to laugh at my defeat!
BecauSe I have loSt to Amar!

1334
02:15:34,559 --> 02:15:37,858
I've loSt to my beSt friend.
Amar winS! And I run away!

1335
02:15:38,230 --> 02:15:40,698
I muSt congratulate Amar...

1347
02:16:11,930 --> 02:16:15,229
At the Snap of a finger, my Secretary
and driverS come running to me.

1348
02:16:15,433 --> 02:16:18,231
There are So many carS and
people waiting outSide.

1349
02:16:18,770 --> 02:16:21,898
I didn't do all thiS to
Show off to you, Radha.

1350
02:16:22,440 --> 02:16:26,740
I wanted to Show you that an
ordinary waiter of your hotel...

1351
02:16:27,445 --> 02:16:30,414
Frankly Speaking,
I like your innocence.

1352
02:16:30,949 --> 02:16:33,918
That Silly idiot who didn't
follow one word...

02:16:34,052 --> 02:16:36,418
knowS So much of EngliSh today!

1354
02:16:41,793 --> 02:16:46,093
And another word I've learnt now.
Unwanted.

1355
02:16:46,965 --> 02:16:50,765
But I'm Saying all thiS to
prove my power to you.

1356
02:16:51,469 --> 02:16:56,270
It'S thankS to whom that I have
got all thiS fame and name...?

1357
02:16:56,474 --> 02:16:59,102
Who waS the one who took
my name to Such heightS?

1358
02:16:59,311 --> 02:17:02,769
The one and only Amar.
My beSt friend.

1359
02:17:03,815 --> 02:17:06,283
Amar haS landed the
preciouS diamond...

1360
02:17:06,985 --> 02:17:11,285
I could never have.

1361
02:17:12,490 --> 02:17:15,288
Who can be happier than I am?

1362
02:17:17,329 --> 02:17:19,957
You're crying, Radha?

1363
02:17:21,166 --> 02:17:23,134
I can't bear to See anyone cry.

1364

A wife iS the pride of the family.

Who can light up my houSehold

02:22:31,809 --> 02:22:35,939
You don't Seem to have heard of

1427
02:22:37,482 --> 02:22:39,450
There uSed to be

1428
02:22:40,151 --> 02:22:42,949
blinded by the love he had

1454
02:26:06,691 --> 02:26:08,659
Ma...

1455
02:26:12,697 --> 02:26:14,995
You have orphaned your Son...?

1456
02:26:34,552 --> 02:26:38,010
"Look, my Son.
You are alwayS cloSe to me"

1457
02:26:38,723 --> 02:26:43,023
"Nobody can Separate

1458
02:26:43,728 --> 02:26:46,196
"JuSt aS a blind man keepS
hiS walking-Stick at hand..."

1459
02:26:46,731 --> 02:26:51,691
"a mother alwayS likeS to have

1460
02:26:52,904 --> 02:26:57,534
"l want to die in my Son'S armS.

1461
02:26:58,910 --> 02:27:01,708
"Do not be far away from me
when I die, my Son"

1462
02:27:02,413 --> 02:27:03,710
"Do not be far away from me"

1463
02:27:03,915 --> 02:27:09,376
YeS, ma... I've been
far away from you.

1464
02:27:10,922 --> 02:27:17,225
That the life I have led iS
make-believe, I realiSe today.

1465
02:27:21,265 --> 02:27:23,233
No one can do anything
about death.

1466
02:27:34,779 --> 02:27:36,747
You muSt perform the laSt riteS
for your mother.

1467
02:27:50,962 --> 02:27:52,429

1473
02:28:30,167 --> 02:28:34,627
ThiS iS for real. The one

1474
02:28:35,840 --> 02:28:38,308
ThoSe flaShy clotheS
Separated me from my mother.

1475
02:28:39,176 --> 02:28:43,135
so I've given up that
profeSSion for good.

1476
02:28:43,514 --> 02:28:46,813
But you are a great artiSt, sunder.
You are public property.

1477
02:28:48,686 --> 02:28:51,484
One sunder will leave,
and another one will arrive.

1478
02:28:52,690 --> 02:28:55,488
There iS no dearth of entertainerS
in the world, Amar.

1479
02:28:56,027 --> 02:28:59,656
so what am I worth?
- What are you going to do then?

1480
02:29:00,364 --> 02:29:06,166
I'm going to See my Mother, Radha.
I'll Surely See her.

1481
02:29:07,538 --> 02:29:10,166
Do not worry, Sir.
Not in the HeavenS.

1482
02:29:10,875 --> 02:29:12,843
In thiS very world,
I will meet my mother.

1483
02:29:13,711 --> 02:29:14,678
Look.

1484
02:29:26,057 --> 02:29:30,858
I See my mother in theSe
innocent children, Amar.

1485
02:29:32,897 --> 02:29:36,856
Their innocent love iS
like my mother'S affection.

1486
02:29:39,403 --> 02:29:43,703
I will dedicate henceforth my life
in the Service of theSe orphanS.

1487
02:29:44,241 --> 02:29:49,702
At the Same time, wherever I go,
I'll make people laugh.

1488
02:29:51,415 --> 02:29:55,875
Here'S your gift, Radha.
It'S from the whole nation.

02:30:02,259 --> 02:30:06,059
