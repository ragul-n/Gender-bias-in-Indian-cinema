1
00:01:25,051 --> 00:01:28,350
New Delhi's National Sports stadium..
The stadium is filled to the brim.

2
00:01:30,223 --> 00:01:35,160
Only 2 minutes left in the
World Men's Hockey Championship..

3
00:01:35,328 --> 00:01:37,523
India is one goal behind Pakistan.

4
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:38,655
Vijay, pass it here!

5
00:01:38,731 --> 00:01:43,168
Indian Captain Kabir Khan, Asia's
best center forward pushing his team

6
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,363
Come on! Come on!

7
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:52,206
Suspense in the audience.

8
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:58,350
Tension on the faces
of the officials..

9
00:01:58,485 --> 00:02:00,009
Like every lndia-Pakistan match,

10
00:02:00,086 --> 00:02:05,183
this match means so much
more than the game itself.

11
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:07,153
Only 1 and a half minutes now

12
00:02:07,227 --> 00:02:09,525
and lndia will have to
fight quickly to save itself.

13
00:02:11,097 --> 00:02:16,160
Ball with Pakistani
defender Waseem.. Scoop!

14
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:25,103
But lndian defender Uttam Singh
snatches it.. India is now on attack!

15
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:08,517
And a penalty stroke for lndia..

16
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:13,684
A breath of life
they desperately need..

17
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:17,621
But who will take this stroke..

18
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:19,164
Ball! Ball!

19
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:23,194
Saini has the ball, but Captain
Kabir is taking the stroke himself..

20
00:03:24,571 --> 00:03:25,629
Maybe a good decision.

21
00:03:25,772 --> 00:03:29,503
India's best player
is its last hope...

22
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:53,256
Coach, is this the same team
that defeated Pakistan last year?

23
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:54,687
No comments.

24
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:57,855
Do you not think our
team is taking it too easy?

25
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:59,488
Please, please, no comments.

26
00:05:01,434 --> 00:05:02,526
Hey, look, it is Kabir!
- Kabir!

27
00:05:02,602 --> 00:05:05,264
He is here!
- Kabir.. Kabir.. Kabir,

28
00:05:05,371 --> 00:05:07,430
do you have anything to say
about such an embarrassing defeat?

29
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,701
Do you really believe
Pakistan's performance was better?

30
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:12,607
Maybe. - Why did you take
the penalty stroke yourself?

31
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:13,737
I made a mistake

32
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:16,213
Rumour has it that the Pakistani
players are your good friends..

33
00:05:16,282 --> 00:05:19,581
you were the only lndian to
congratulate them after the match..

34
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:20,877
Excuse me!

35
00:05:20,953 --> 00:05:22,215
People are saying..
there is a rumour that you..

36
00:05:22,288 --> 00:05:25,382
or someone else in the lndian team
has deliberately thrown this match?

37
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:26,549
Excuse me!

38
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:29,526
Do you think we lost
because someone sold out?

39
00:05:30,596 --> 00:05:33,292
What! What did you say?

40
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:35,594
Kabir Khan, has
someone sold out their team?

41
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:36,726
Sold out! You piece of..

42
00:05:40,606 --> 00:05:41,664
How dare you..

43
00:05:46,312 --> 00:05:48,507
How can you disrespect the media!

44
00:05:48,581 --> 00:05:50,310
Disrespect the media!
You son of a.. Come here.

45
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:52,408
You do not know how
to treat journalists!

46
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:53,883
You bloody -.. sold out

47
00:05:57,323 --> 00:05:58,415
Come back here!

48
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:01,257
You just witnessed a
frustrated captain of the loosing

49
00:06:01,327 --> 00:06:03,591
team attack the media violently.

50
00:06:03,763 --> 00:06:06,254
His outburst cannot
hide the fact that there..

51
00:06:06,332 --> 00:06:09,460
..is definitely
something fishy going on.

52
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:11,329
We have our answers.

53
00:06:11,437 --> 00:06:13,268
But it is now up to
you to decide whether

54
00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:16,399
Kabir Khan has played
dirty with the country or not.

55
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:20,777
Satyavrat Yadav,
National Stadium, New Delhi..

56
00:06:21,347 --> 00:06:22,871
News from the world of sports.

57
00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:27,283
Pakistan has become the
new Hockey World Champions

58
00:06:27,353 --> 00:06:30,345
after defeating lndia by one goal.

59
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:40,293
Today the Chairman of the
Hockey Association denounced

60
00:06:40,366 --> 00:06:44,803
Kabir Khan, declared he
did his country wrong.

61
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:48,363
And all this is thanks to you..
the lndian public.

62
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:49,635
We have two special guests..

63
00:06:56,716 --> 00:06:58,581
Down with Kabir!

64
00:07:01,387 --> 00:07:03,878
What do you think? Did
Kabir Khan fix the match?

65
00:07:04,023 --> 00:07:05,786
Do not know if he fixed the match,
but we lost because of him.

66
00:07:05,858 --> 00:07:06,916
And what would you say?

67
00:07:06,993 --> 00:07:08,858
These people should
be hung upside down.

68
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:09,986
And you?

69
00:07:10,062 --> 00:07:13,759
These kind of people should have
moved to Pakistan during the partition.

70
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:17,394
Down with Kabir!

71
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:23,401
The public is upset with
the team's performance.

72
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:24,568
And Kabir Khan has
conveniently disappeared.

73
00:07:24,644 --> 00:07:27,807
He was not at the hockey stadium, nor
the Sports Authority of lndia Campus.

74
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,938
Where is Kabir Khan?

75
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:14,817
Do not look back mother, let us go.

76
00:08:15,461 --> 00:08:16,553
How can I not, Kabir..

77
00:08:18,898 --> 00:08:23,926
Your grandfather saved every
penny to build this house..

78
00:08:25,471 --> 00:08:30,101
Your father's first pay check
went into making these windows..

79
00:08:31,744 --> 00:08:33,803
I stepped into this
home as a young bride..

80
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:40,141
Whatever happens, I know all these
people will stand by us, trust me.

81
00:08:42,822 --> 00:08:49,853
My master

82
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,089
TRAlTOR

83
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:57,134
Do not look there, son.

84
00:09:00,573 --> 00:09:02,507
You can close your eyes if
you can not bear to see it..

85
00:09:04,844 --> 00:09:05,936
I want to see everything.

86
00:09:06,512 --> 00:09:08,036
TRAlTOR

87
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:09,809
Come son. Let us go!

88
00:09:10,516 --> 00:09:14,850
The third colour of
your being, that was l

89
00:09:14,921 --> 00:09:17,515
Papa, papa, I want to see
what a traitor looks like.

90
00:09:17,623 --> 00:09:18,715
Come, see!

91
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:24,627
Your tune was the rhythm of my life

92
00:09:24,697 --> 00:09:26,460
Just some food for the road..

93
00:09:26,532 --> 00:09:27,794
Do you want us to be
thrown out of the neighbourhood?

94
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:30,961
My divine master, you are my pride

95
00:09:31,037 --> 00:09:40,969
My master, my life is yours to take

96
00:10:31,597 --> 00:10:32,757
So, what have you decided?

97
00:10:32,898 --> 00:10:37,733
Uttamji, you are always
harping on the same thing.

98
00:10:38,938 --> 00:10:40,599
What should we do about the coach?

99
00:10:41,941 --> 00:10:42,999
Hey, why don't you
become their coach?

100
00:10:43,609 --> 00:10:45,907
The Women's Hockey World Cup
is just three months away.

101
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:47,707
The team cannot just go
without any training..

102
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,745
No matter how much you
train them, they will loose..

103
00:10:51,617 --> 00:10:54,051
The lndian Women's hockey
team has never achieved anything

104
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,178
and it never will.

105
00:10:55,955 --> 00:10:58,219
It is a government trip.

106
00:11:00,626 --> 00:11:02,719
Why do you not go as their coach?

107
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:08,798
The team will be out in a
couple of matches. Exit!

108
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:14,201
You and your wife
could enjoy a holiday.

109
00:11:17,276 --> 00:11:20,768
I do not get it - why do you not
take women's hockey seriously.

110
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:24,709
And we do no get why
you take it so seriously.

111
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:29,283
Uttamji, lndian women
are born to cook and clean.

112
00:11:29,755 --> 00:11:33,657
They cannot run
around in short skirts.

113
00:11:34,927 --> 00:11:37,828
How can an Association
member say such things?

114
00:11:37,897 --> 00:11:38,955
It is because we are
in the Association

115
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:41,192
and have travelled around the
world, that we can say such things.

116
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:48,836
Look, you have done your part and
selected the top 1 6 lndian players.

117
00:11:48,941 --> 00:11:55,972
Punjab, Tamil Nadu,
Jharkand, Andhra, Railways.

118
00:11:57,316 --> 00:12:00,285
You have even been to
remote Manipur and Mizoram.

119
00:12:00,786 --> 00:12:04,017
But now where will you
find a coach? From the moon?

120
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:07,090
Is this also the girls' fault?

121
00:12:07,693 --> 00:12:08,853
No, It is not the girls' fault.

122
00:12:08,994 --> 00:12:11,224
It is the fault, of people like
you with expectations from them.

123
00:12:13,265 --> 00:12:17,702
No sponsors.. no viewers..
no TV coverage, nor media..

124
00:12:17,803 --> 00:12:22,240
Now which coach will want to jump
into this mess to ruin his career?

125
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:23,707
Is there anyone? No one.

126
00:12:25,277 --> 00:12:26,335
There is one man.

127
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,038
Who?

128
00:12:29,882 --> 00:12:31,008
Kabir.

129
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,778
Who?

130
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:36,913
Kabir Khan.

131
00:12:39,725 --> 00:12:40,885
The Kabir Khan who..

132
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,018
Yes that one.

133
00:12:42,728 --> 00:12:44,787
Since when has he developed
an interest in women's hockey?

134
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,995
He even left men's hockey years ago.

135
00:12:48,734 --> 00:12:50,895
No one has seen him
for six-seven years.

136
00:12:51,036 --> 00:12:52,094
You can see him now.

137
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:53,229
Where?

138
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:54,738
Outside. In the reception.

139
00:13:11,257 --> 00:13:15,159
Do not attack the opposing
team's goal but their minds.

140
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:18,758
You will win the goal automatically.

141
00:13:18,931 --> 00:13:20,057
Sir
- Hmm?

142
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:21,190
You have been called inside.

143
00:13:28,073 --> 00:13:29,335
Sir
- Kabir.

144
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:36,111
How many years has it..

145
00:13:36,182 --> 00:13:40,778
Seven years, three months.. ten,
eleven, twelve, thirteen

146
00:13:40,853 --> 00:13:42,218
7 years, 3 months, 14 days.

147
00:13:44,123 --> 00:13:47,820
What.. what were you
doing all these years?

148
00:13:49,094 --> 00:13:50,857
I was preparing for this meeting.

149
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:53,931
He wants to be the coach of
the lndian Women's Hockey Team.

150
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:59,804
You are not a child Mr. Kabir Khan.

151
00:14:01,073 --> 00:14:02,734
You know in a country like ours,

152
00:14:02,808 --> 00:14:08,212
a women's team exists just
as a formality, not a reality.

153
00:14:09,982 --> 00:14:13,816
Your reputation is already..

154
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:22,156
And you wish to redeem your
name by coaching this team.

155
00:14:22,828 --> 00:14:28,198
A team that is not fit to play
against European high schools.

156
00:14:33,472 --> 00:14:35,099
This is exactly the team I want.

157
00:14:35,841 --> 00:14:38,071
I do not understand..

158
00:14:39,411 --> 00:14:41,106
I do not think you would.

159
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,946
So shall I consider myself hired?

160
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:56,227
In any case, you do
not have another coach.

161
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,907
I have done all I could,

162
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:18,945
but you should think about it.

163
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:20,177
I have.

164
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:24,250
Kabir this not a team.
It is a graveyard.

165
00:15:25,057 --> 00:15:26,319
Why are you burying in it?

166
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:31,195
This team will never get
a better coach than you.

167
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:32,963
But think about yourself.

168
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:34,156
I am thinking about myself.

169
00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:40,005
You have changed.
You have changed a lot.

170
00:15:40,172 --> 00:15:44,074
I have not changed. Nothing has.

171
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:49,177
You know we did not lose
that match because of you.

172
00:15:49,915 --> 00:15:52,213
You did all you could to
score a goal against Pakistan

173
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:59,049
But they scored against me, my
team, my country.. and my family.

174
00:15:59,925 --> 00:16:01,358
Everybody is allowed one mistake.

175
00:16:05,097 --> 00:16:06,189
Everybody?

176
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:12,931
Kabir, why have you come back?

177
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:17,204
To help this team to
win the World Cup.

178
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:19,336
Which is impossible..

179
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:21,573
Is what needs to be done.

180
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:25,317
when are your 1 6 girls coming?

181
00:16:26,251 --> 00:16:28,549
They should reach here tomorrow
morning from their respective states.

182
00:16:29,388 --> 00:16:32,414
States.. nothing has changed.

183
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:36,187
There were states then,
there are states now..

184
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:08,817
There you go..

185
00:17:11,696 --> 00:17:12,754
Well ma'am, once again it looks like

186
00:17:12,831 --> 00:17:15,322
the Association has
dumped all of lndia on us.

187
00:17:16,968 --> 00:17:18,902
So these are the best?

188
00:17:19,003 --> 00:17:20,061
That's what they say.

189
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,873
Wasn't she the
goalkeeper for the Railways?

190
00:17:25,076 --> 00:17:26,134
What was her name?

191
00:17:26,244 --> 00:17:28,109
Vidya.. Vidya Sharma.

192
00:17:29,047 --> 00:17:32,141
Heard she got
married and quit hockey?

193
00:17:32,884 --> 00:17:33,942
Well she's here..

194
00:17:40,992 --> 00:17:45,156
1 00 rupees? My foot! Is
the meter for decoration?

195
00:17:45,263 --> 00:17:46,890
The meter is broken, you
will have to give me 1 00.

196
00:17:46,965 --> 00:17:48,865
I will give you 1 00 slaps!
- What sort of talk is that?

197
00:17:48,933 --> 00:17:51,993
The kind you will understand! Take the
50 or I will shove the hockey stick!

198
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:53,128
Don't get angry.

199
00:17:53,338 --> 00:17:55,704
Your head will
explode one of these days.

200
00:17:55,807 --> 00:17:57,775
But grandma, you are not
saying anything to him.

201
00:17:57,909 --> 00:17:59,968
Is he my baby or are you?

202
00:18:00,712 --> 00:18:02,009
I am.
- So?

203
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,342
Cool down, come, come.. drink it in.

204
00:18:34,245 --> 00:18:35,735
Hey! What the.. you brats!

205
00:18:38,016 --> 00:18:39,074
Hey Komal!

206
00:18:43,755 --> 00:18:46,189
These pansies! Thought
I'd show them how to play!

207
00:18:47,158 --> 00:18:49,126
You haven't come
here to play with boys!

208
00:18:49,227 --> 00:18:50,285
No.. just wanted to check out

209
00:18:50,361 --> 00:18:52,124
whether these Delhi dudes can play.

210
00:18:52,263 --> 00:18:53,924
There's no way I'm letting my
girl play in a big city like Delhi.

211
00:18:54,032 --> 00:18:55,966
Come on. Let's go,
get back in the car

212
00:18:56,034 --> 00:18:57,092
Oh come now! We have come this far..

213
00:18:57,168 --> 00:18:58,692
Let her do what
she wants. After all,

214
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:01,068
she will be playing a home
maker for the rest of her life.

215
00:19:01,139 --> 00:19:02,197
I will never give up playing!

216
00:19:02,273 --> 00:19:03,968
Oh yeah? What will you feed
your husband when he is hungry?

217
00:19:04,042 --> 00:19:05,100
This!

218
00:19:05,176 --> 00:19:06,803
Enough! I don't want
my girl playing hockey.

219
00:19:08,413 --> 00:19:12,144
Once she slips out of our grasp,
who will ask for her hand?

220
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:13,308
Let them try!

221
00:19:22,427 --> 00:19:25,794
Gul, your grandfathers,
your father, your brother

222
00:19:25,863 --> 00:19:28,991
all have excelled in
this game, my dear.

223
00:19:29,267 --> 00:19:33,101
Now it is your turn.
Don't let the lqbals down.

224
00:19:44,415 --> 00:19:46,144
Name please.
- Ho?

225
00:19:47,118 --> 00:19:49,279
Ho? Name. What is your name?

226
00:19:49,821 --> 00:19:50,879
Soimoi.

227
00:19:50,955 --> 00:19:53,287
I asked for your name.
Not your medical condition.

228
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:54,416
Soimoi.

229
00:19:54,826 --> 00:19:56,225
Is that your name?
- Ho.

230
00:19:56,461 --> 00:20:00,158
Ho again? Your full name..
name! Name!

231
00:20:00,331 --> 00:20:03,960
Soimoi Kerketa. She
doesn't understand English.

232
00:20:04,102 --> 00:20:05,899
And you are?
- Rani (Queen)

233
00:20:06,004 --> 00:20:09,940
Have you escaped from an asylum?
What do you want?

234
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:11,235
Rani Dispotta.

235
00:20:11,909 --> 00:20:13,968
Are you from the travelling theatre?

236
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:16,379
The stadium won't be
available till the new year. Go away!

237
00:20:20,184 --> 00:20:24,484
Ghamorni.. state board.. Jharkhand..

238
00:20:26,124 --> 00:20:28,183
Oh dear!

239
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,219
These two are hockey players!

240
00:20:31,296 --> 00:20:32,354
Ho, ho, ho!

241
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:37,901
Name?
- Nethra Reddy.

242
00:20:38,002 --> 00:20:39,060
So you are a Madrasi?

243
00:20:39,871 --> 00:20:40,929
Telegu.

244
00:20:41,005 --> 00:20:42,063
Tamil.

245
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:43,266
Not Tamil, Telegu.

246
00:20:43,374 --> 00:20:46,901
Same thing. What's the
difference between Tamil and Telegu?

247
00:20:47,011 --> 00:20:50,139
The same difference that is
there between Punjabi and Bihari.

248
00:20:50,214 --> 00:20:51,272
Oh really?

249
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:53,176
Can I go?

250
00:20:54,886 --> 00:20:55,944
What?

251
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:57,078
Ho ho!

252
00:21:13,237 --> 00:21:16,934
Man! Look at that vanilla ice
cream amidst all this chocolate!

253
00:21:17,475 --> 00:21:18,840
Must be heading to a
disco or a nightclub..

254
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:21,174
Looks like they lost their way.

255
00:21:21,346 --> 00:21:24,509
You think they are players?

256
00:21:24,582 --> 00:21:26,948
Definitely players. But not here..

257
00:21:28,052 --> 00:21:30,145
Ya? Wonder what
the going rates are..

258
00:21:30,288 --> 00:21:32,449
Why don't you ask them? They
won't get our language anyway

259
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:34,480
Hey, how much are those melons for?

260
00:21:37,228 --> 00:21:39,560
What the.. They understand Hindi!

261
00:21:39,931 --> 00:21:41,956
Thought they were
Chinese or Nepali..

262
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:46,002
Molly Zimik, Manipur.
Mary Ralte, Mizoram.

263
00:21:46,204 --> 00:21:50,231
Wow! You have come from the
furthest reaches of lndia.

264
00:21:51,275 --> 00:21:53,300
You are our special guests. Welcome!

265
00:21:54,512 --> 00:21:56,946
What.. are you not happy?

266
00:21:57,148 --> 00:21:59,548
Would you be happy being treated
like an alien in your own country?

267
00:22:16,534 --> 00:22:18,263
Bindia, Aliya how are you?

268
00:22:19,971 --> 00:22:21,097
Pretty fit.

269
00:22:23,307 --> 00:22:24,604
How's your injury Gunjan?

270
00:22:24,976 --> 00:22:27,467
An injury madam will take
its own sweet time to go.

271
00:22:27,979 --> 00:22:30,607
You are the senior players.
Behave like one.

272
00:22:30,982 --> 00:22:32,540
Be respectful around the new coach.

273
00:22:32,617 --> 00:22:35,313
Respect, madam, will
take its own time to come.

274
00:22:36,988 --> 00:22:39,149
Sukhlal! Become older!

275
00:22:56,307 --> 00:23:00,107
My name is Kabir Khan. I'm the Coach

276
00:23:01,345 --> 00:23:02,937
of the lndian National
Women's Hockey Team..

277
00:23:03,014 --> 00:23:05,380
which I have been
told are you girls.

278
00:23:06,284 --> 00:23:08,081
All the players here, Krishnaji?

279
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:12,046
Yes sir. Only one's missing..
Uh, Preeti Sabarwal

280
00:23:12,156 --> 00:23:14,215
Reporting time was 10 am, wasn't it?

281
00:23:14,292 --> 00:23:15,350
Excuse me!

282
00:23:17,361 --> 00:23:19,454
Is this the
registration for the women's team?

283
00:23:20,398 --> 00:23:22,491
The registration for the lndian
National Women's team is over.

284
00:23:23,034 --> 00:23:25,525
Bloody hell! I'm Preeti Sabarwal.

285
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:30,234
Bloody hell Preeti Sabarwal!
You are very late. Try next year.

286
00:23:30,374 --> 00:23:31,432
Sorry?

287
00:23:31,509 --> 00:23:32,567
Next year.

288
00:23:34,412 --> 00:23:35,674
Sorry?
- Next year!

289
00:23:36,047 --> 00:23:37,241
Everybody, fall in line please!

290
00:23:37,315 --> 00:23:38,373
Ho?

291
00:23:38,616 --> 00:23:40,106
Come on everyone, line up.

292
00:23:47,391 --> 00:23:48,483
She is a good player, sir.

293
00:23:50,094 --> 00:23:54,121
I will be the judge of who is a
good player or a bad player Krishnaji.

294
00:23:54,265 --> 00:23:55,357
Thank you.

295
00:23:56,467 --> 00:23:59,698
You.. you can't keep out
a state team captain..

296
00:24:01,105 --> 00:24:03,573
Which state team's captain are you?
- Chandigarh

297
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:06,074
Is this the Chandigarh team?

298
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:07,669
No.

299
00:24:09,747 --> 00:24:11,612
But I'm a captain of a state team.

300
00:24:11,716 --> 00:24:14,344
And I'm the coach of the
lndian National Women's Team.

301
00:24:15,419 --> 00:24:18,286
I cannot hear or see
the names of states.

302
00:24:18,656 --> 00:24:21,386
I can only hear the name
of one country - lndia.

303
00:24:21,492 --> 00:24:25,553
And in that team, there is
no place for late comers.

304
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:26,722
Everyone understand that?

305
00:24:30,201 --> 00:24:32,669
OK..OK, kit up.

306
00:24:33,104 --> 00:24:37,734
Kit up and do 10
rounds in exactly 7 minutes.

307
00:24:38,109 --> 00:24:40,407
If you are done in 7 minutes,
come join the team.

308
00:24:40,678 --> 00:24:43,272
If not, take the
train back to Chandigarh.

309
00:24:45,283 --> 00:24:46,375
Sir, 7 minutes!

310
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:47,508
Sshhh, Krishnaji.

311
00:24:50,488 --> 00:24:54,117
Now each player will step
forward and introduce herself.

312
00:24:56,127 --> 00:24:57,185
You!

313
00:24:57,328 --> 00:24:58,556
Balbir Kaur, Punjab

314
00:25:00,464 --> 00:25:01,522
Again.

315
00:25:02,199 --> 00:25:03,632
Balbir Kaur, Punjab

316
00:25:04,502 --> 00:25:05,594
Again.

317
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:07,365
Balbir Kaur, Punjab

318
00:25:07,471 --> 00:25:09,496
Break away from the
team and step aside.

319
00:25:10,541 --> 00:25:11,667
Komal Chautala, Haryana

320
00:25:11,742 --> 00:25:12,800
Out!

321
00:25:13,077 --> 00:25:14,408
Molly Zimik, Manipur
- Out!

322
00:25:14,478 --> 00:25:16,070
Nethra Reddy, Andhra Pradesh

323
00:25:16,213 --> 00:25:17,646
Out
- Rachna Prasad, Bihar.

324
00:25:18,482 --> 00:25:19,540
Nichola Sequeira, Maharashtra

325
00:25:19,617 --> 00:25:20,675

326
00:25:20,751 --> 00:25:21,809
Vidya Sharma, lndia

327
00:25:25,156 --> 00:25:26,214
Hmm?

328
00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:27,348
Vidya Sharma, lndia

329
00:25:27,458 --> 00:25:28,516
Once more loudly.

330
00:25:28,593 --> 00:25:30,151
Vidya Sharma, lndia

331
00:25:30,294 --> 00:25:32,228
Thank you. You are on the team.

332
00:25:33,464 --> 00:25:38,401
Anyone else who is playing for Punjab,
Himachal, Tamil Nadu, Railways?

333
00:25:39,503 --> 00:25:44,440
Understand this once and for all,
because I won't repeat it.

334
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:49,273
This team needs only those
players who first play for lndia,

335
00:25:49,814 --> 00:25:52,339
then for their teammates,

336
00:25:52,516 --> 00:25:55,610
and then if they have any
life left, for themselves.

337
00:25:57,455 --> 00:26:03,485
Not those who are playing for a
Government job or a Railway flat. Hmmm?

338
00:26:03,561 --> 00:26:04,619
Ho!

339
00:26:04,695 --> 00:26:08,529
Ho? Let's try one
more time. Come, please.

340
00:26:10,201 --> 00:26:11,463

00:26:32,857 --> 00:26:34,586
Gunjan Lakhani, lndia

354
00:26:35,292 --> 00:26:37,385
Bindia Naik, lndia

355
00:26:39,664 --> 00:26:42,292
Preeti Sabarwal, lndia

356
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:00,547
Come on, move it, move it

357
00:27:16,701 --> 00:27:18,635
Didi(elder sister), didi! You
are Bindia Naik, aren't you?

358
00:27:18,936 --> 00:27:20,733
You hold a National
record of 42 goals!

359
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:21,863
So?

360
00:27:21,939 --> 00:27:24,407
I am so happy to meet you!

361
00:27:24,575 --> 00:27:25,769
Yay! Go dance then!

362
00:27:45,296 --> 00:27:46,558
On the list this is my bed.

363
00:27:47,732 --> 00:27:50,292
There's the list. Go sleep there.

364
00:27:52,303 --> 00:27:53,361
Forget it Molly!

365
00:27:53,571 --> 00:27:54,629
Correct.

366
00:27:55,306 --> 00:27:56,364
Hello! I am Nethra.

367
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,498
Vidya.

368
00:27:57,575 --> 00:28:01,477
I know. You saved 4 goals in
the South Zone tournament.

369
00:28:01,946 --> 00:28:03,743
Didn't save them,
just happened somehow.

370
00:28:03,814 --> 00:28:04,872
It was all luck.

371
00:28:05,349 --> 00:28:07,476
Only good players have good 'luck'.

372
00:28:13,724 --> 00:28:15,988
Whoa.. what's this?

373
00:28:17,661 --> 00:28:18,719
Ho?

374
00:28:18,829 --> 00:28:20,421
What is this?

375
00:28:20,531 --> 00:28:22,362
'Moke daayar se laglak'

376
00:28:22,967 --> 00:28:25,697
She is saying a branch scraped her
while travelling on an elephant.

377
00:28:26,337 --> 00:28:28,532
You came to Delhi on an elephant?

378
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,403
No, only till Gha-morni. (morni
- peacock)

379
00:28:31,542 --> 00:28:35,774
Peacocks? What peacock?
Peacocks, elephants..

380
00:28:35,846 --> 00:28:37,609
You live in a zoo?

381
00:28:38,349 --> 00:28:40,715
Jharkhand. We are from Jharkhand.

382
00:28:41,619 --> 00:28:43,712
[Jhadi=bush]

383
00:28:44,555 --> 00:28:46,489
Oh! Lots of bushes there?

384
00:28:46,824 --> 00:28:49,486
Jungle. It is a jungle there.

385
00:28:49,627 --> 00:28:52,357
Jungle? Are you Junglees?

386
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:54,760
You eat snakes and scorpions? I
hope there aren't any in your bag?

387
00:28:57,468 --> 00:29:01,404
Are you upset?

388
00:29:02,706 --> 00:29:05,470
Alright! Here
- you sleep on the floor.

389
00:29:14,752 --> 00:29:16,447
What are you doing?

390
00:29:16,554 --> 00:29:17,680
Sorry?

391
00:29:17,788 --> 00:29:20,382
Nothing to be sorry about..
move this..

392
00:29:20,524 --> 00:29:22,651
What the
- What do you think you're doing?

393
00:29:22,726 --> 00:29:23,954
This is my bed.

394
00:29:24,595 --> 00:29:26,790
Did you not see
this big bundle here?

395
00:29:26,864 --> 00:29:27,922
So?

396
00:29:28,032 --> 00:29:30,967
So? I put it here first,
so the bed is mine.

397
00:29:31,468 --> 00:29:33,698
Just because you dumped
this bundle, it is your bed?

398
00:29:33,804 --> 00:29:36,398
Of course! Haven't you
ever been on a state bus?

399
00:29:36,507 --> 00:29:38,407
I have reserved this bed first!

400
00:29:39,043 --> 00:29:40,533
It is mine on the list.

401
00:29:41,412 --> 00:29:45,746
Oh you.. what the..

402
00:29:54,758 --> 00:29:56,419
I will smash your face!

403
00:29:56,493 --> 00:29:57,551
Hey kid!

404
00:29:58,729 --> 00:30:00,560
Get here.

405
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:02,657
C'mon!

406
00:30:10,875 --> 00:30:12,809
There is a time and
place for every fight.

407
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:16,846
Save this one for another day
- when you have the upper hand.

408
00:30:18,515 --> 00:30:19,607
Get out!

409
00:30:21,452 --> 00:30:23,977
Come. Be on this side with us.

410
00:30:34,498 --> 00:30:36,557
The travelling theatre
would have been better!

411
00:30:39,036 --> 00:30:41,402
I am told that from
the 250 million girls

412
00:30:41,472 --> 00:30:45,465
in this country you are
the 16 best hockey players.

413
00:30:48,646 --> 00:30:50,841
You're lucky, but also unlucky.

414
00:30:52,049 --> 00:30:54,677
Because now I'll be the judge.

415
00:30:55,920 --> 00:31:00,550
For me, you are only 16
girls who dabble in hockey.

416
00:31:01,525 --> 00:31:04,494
Don't expect anymore.
You'll regret it.

417
00:31:12,503 --> 00:31:18,806
Ten kilometers. Everyone Come on!

418
00:31:19,576 --> 00:31:20,770
Come on, girls!

419
00:31:21,712 --> 00:31:23,680
Training us for a
marathon or a match?

420
00:31:54,878 --> 00:31:55,936
Hey!

421
00:32:09,994 --> 00:32:12,053
Running at 4am won't make
us better hockey players.

422
00:32:14,031 --> 00:32:19,560
How dare he treat national
players like this! We're not kids.

423
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:21,135
Does he think we
don't know how to train?

424
00:32:25,909 --> 00:32:32,781
Move, you..

425
00:32:37,955 --> 00:32:39,149
Take your positions.
What's going on?

426
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:43,852
What's the problem?

427
00:32:44,595 --> 00:32:45,653
You are playing right in.

428
00:32:45,729 --> 00:32:46,787
But sir..

429
00:32:46,864 --> 00:32:48,695
I think you will
play better as right in.

430
00:32:48,766 --> 00:32:51,792
But.. I have always played
center forward for our Haryana team..

431
00:32:51,902 --> 00:32:55,702
Ok, go! Play for the Haryana team.
Everybody in position!

432
00:33:06,016 --> 00:33:07,074
What is it?

433
00:33:07,184 --> 00:33:08,981
Coach sir has instructed me
to play on the forward line.

434
00:33:11,121 --> 00:33:12,645
Go home and play.

435
00:33:18,929 --> 00:33:22,626
Listen
- push her out and take her place.

436
00:33:22,733 --> 00:33:23,961
But the coach has asked me
to play in this position.

437
00:33:24,034 --> 00:33:26,059
So if the coach asks you
to jump in a well, you will?

438
00:33:26,637 --> 00:33:27,695
But the coach..

439
00:33:27,771 --> 00:33:32,140
Look, coaches will come and go.
But you will be with us, right?

440
00:33:32,843 --> 00:33:34,037
Yes, but coach..

441
00:33:34,111 --> 00:33:35,908
See, she's leaving to
drink water. Grab her place.

442
00:33:36,947 --> 00:33:38,972
Don't take my name.

443
00:33:46,657 --> 00:33:47,715
What's going on?

444
00:33:50,094 --> 00:33:51,959
I play forward every year.

445
00:33:52,062 --> 00:33:53,654
Yes but in this team
you are the centre..

446
00:33:53,730 --> 00:33:56,290
This team or that team it
doesn't make a difference.

447
00:33:57,067 --> 00:33:58,762
It makes a difference to the team.

448
00:33:59,336 --> 00:34:01,031
You're a senior player,
a strong player.

449
00:34:01,305 --> 00:34:06,174
The team needs you at centre half.
Go to your new position.

450
00:34:07,978 --> 00:34:09,036
Sorry.

451
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:10,738
Hmmm.

452
00:34:14,084 --> 00:34:15,142
Out.

453
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:16,277
What..

454
00:34:16,353 --> 00:34:19,186
Sit out and let the
others play.. Out!

455
00:35:04,801 --> 00:35:06,200
Move!

456
00:35:20,184 --> 00:35:22,414
Good goal! Very
good Preeti Sabarwal!

457
00:35:25,956 --> 00:35:27,321
Come on everyone, back to one!

458
00:35:40,837 --> 00:35:42,134
Komal! Pass the ball!

459
00:35:44,107 --> 00:35:46,166
I'm free, dammit, pass the ball!

460
00:36:03,227 --> 00:36:05,092
Komal! Komal!

461
00:36:12,169 --> 00:36:13,193
What was that?

462
00:36:13,804 --> 00:36:14,896
I scored a goal sir!

463
00:36:15,005 --> 00:36:16,063
Out!

464
00:36:18,475 --> 00:36:21,876
But you didn't see
what that girl was up to!

465
00:36:21,979 --> 00:36:23,810
I saw everything
that's going on here.

466
00:36:23,914 --> 00:36:25,939
When she scored the goal
there was no one around her,

467
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:29,277
But when you scored, she was there.

468
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:31,150
And the only one in
the scoring position..

469
00:36:34,324 --> 00:36:35,382
Out!

470
00:36:41,465 --> 00:36:44,298
Everybody can only see the
Memsahib but are blind to her faults.

471
00:36:44,401 --> 00:36:47,893
The British have gone but left
behind their Memsahibs in cities.

472
00:36:48,038 --> 00:36:49,335
Just step in my village once!

473
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,933
If I don't tie you up with the
buffalo's tail, you can change my name.

474
00:36:54,011 --> 00:36:55,137
Coach took Memsahib's side.

475
00:36:57,981 --> 00:37:00,347
He's only a coach, not God.

476
00:37:06,923 --> 00:37:09,483
Come let us rest for a while.

477
00:37:22,973 --> 00:37:24,065
Hey!

478
00:37:41,224 --> 00:37:42,282
Out..

479
00:37:53,904 --> 00:37:55,838
So chowmein! Get angry once more and

480
00:37:55,906 --> 00:37:58,466
They will pour chilli
sauce on you and chew you up.

481
00:38:05,546 --> 00:38:06,945
Come, come here!

482
00:38:07,548 --> 00:38:12,542
Take it, take it, take it, damn you!

483
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:16,886
Moka! Moka (Pass to me!)

484
00:38:17,992 --> 00:38:21,018
Stop it, stop that, stop the ball..

485
00:38:22,864 --> 00:38:24,889
You piece of.. go kill
yourself or I will kill you.

486
00:38:26,734 --> 00:38:27,860
The bloody..

487
00:38:28,569 --> 00:38:29,627
What happened?

488
00:38:29,704 --> 00:38:31,604
Did you not see? This
witch let them score a goal!

489
00:38:31,773 --> 00:38:33,832
You know she can not
understand Punjabi.

490
00:38:33,908 --> 00:38:35,637
She should have learnt
it before coming here!

491
00:38:35,810 --> 00:38:37,869
She was only supposed to have
learnt hockey. Which she has.

492
00:38:38,579 --> 00:38:39,671
Apologize to her.

493
00:38:39,947 --> 00:38:41,847
I have never apologized
- not even to my father!

494
00:38:41,916 --> 00:38:42,974
Out..

495
00:38:43,051 --> 00:38:44,109
What!

496
00:38:44,218 --> 00:38:45,708
Out! Out!

497
00:38:46,754 --> 00:38:48,847
Why do you not tell her off?

498
00:38:48,956 --> 00:38:50,787
She is not worth talking to

499
00:38:52,226 --> 00:38:54,091
I have always said
- do not play with Junglees!

500
00:38:57,932 --> 00:38:59,593
You look very angry.

501
00:39:00,635 --> 00:39:02,000
You looked like you
would break her head..

502
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:03,128
Should I break yours?

503
00:39:17,952 --> 00:39:21,012
Sir, how long should
these girls be benched?

504
00:39:23,157 --> 00:39:24,249
Don't know.

505
00:39:26,627 --> 00:39:29,790
I do not think anyone can teach
these girls to play hockey together.

506
00:39:29,964 --> 00:39:32,023
Teaching them hockey
is a long way off.

507
00:39:32,633 --> 00:39:34,931
I need to teach them
something else first.

508
00:39:36,838 --> 00:39:37,896
Good evening!

509
00:40:16,010 --> 00:40:17,068
What is going on?

510
00:40:17,678 --> 00:40:18,804
New sleeping arrangements?

511
00:40:19,247 --> 00:40:21,147
Old.. according to the old list.

512
00:40:21,215 --> 00:40:22,944
So? Tell them the list tore..

513
00:40:23,317 --> 00:40:24,909
come on, go to your old place.

514
00:40:25,019 --> 00:40:27,681
No girl will stay with
another girl from her own state.

515
00:40:27,788 --> 00:40:28,914
It is the Coach's order.

516
00:40:29,690 --> 00:40:31,988
So let him say it. Who cares?

517
00:40:32,059 --> 00:40:33,117
Everyone else has agreed.

518
00:40:33,194 --> 00:40:35,822
If you have any
problems speak to the coach.

519
00:40:37,899 --> 00:40:41,130
Bake in sun all day,
switch beds at night..

520
00:40:42,336 --> 00:40:44,770
Is this a National
camp or a refugee camp?

521
00:40:45,273 --> 00:40:49,369
Why doesn't he make every
one sleep on the benches?

522
00:40:52,713 --> 00:40:53,805
How are you?

523
00:40:53,881 --> 00:40:55,280
I have had enough, please come back.

524
00:40:55,716 --> 00:40:56,910
I cannot come.

525
00:40:56,984 --> 00:41:00,715
It is uncle Samir's sister's wedding.
Mom and dad asked me to call you.

526
00:41:00,821 --> 00:41:02,721
Rakesh you know this
is the National camp-

527
00:41:02,790 --> 00:41:03,882
But Vidya..

528
00:41:03,958 --> 00:41:07,086
Look, family comes first,
games later..

529
00:41:07,161 --> 00:41:08,253
But, father-in-law..

530
00:41:08,329 --> 00:41:10,194
Look, you insisted,
so we let you play.

531
00:41:10,298 --> 00:41:12,357
Now we are calling you, so
come back by the next train.

532
00:41:12,733 --> 00:41:13,791
Yes.. but l..

533
00:41:17,138 --> 00:41:19,265
Rakesh please understand.
I cannot come.

534
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:21,935
I have waited a long
time for this camp.

535
00:41:22,043 --> 00:41:24,876
Vidya, you are a saint.
But I am not.

536
00:41:25,012 --> 00:41:26,673
I cannot keep waiting. The
wedding is day after tomorrow.

537
00:41:26,747 --> 00:41:28,772
Come if you want or forget it.

538
00:41:42,029 --> 00:41:43,189
So?

539
00:41:43,264 --> 00:41:44,697
They wanted a
traditional daughter-in-law..

540
00:41:44,765 --> 00:41:46,858
..grandchildren, the
whole work from me..

541
00:41:49,203 --> 00:41:51,068
..but all I have is
this hockey stick.

542
00:41:51,172 --> 00:41:55,336
Oh! Is this how you scare them away?

543
00:41:59,947 --> 00:42:03,405
If you want, you can go
home for a couple of days.

544
00:42:04,919 --> 00:42:07,046
If I go now, I will not come back.

545
00:42:07,788 --> 00:42:10,086
It is either this side. Or that.

546
00:42:16,130 --> 00:42:18,360
But.. When you
were getting married..

547
00:42:18,432 --> 00:42:21,094
I told them everything.
They were thrilled then..

548
00:42:22,203 --> 00:42:24,933
I had a job thanks to the sports
quota as well as a government flat.

549
00:42:27,441 --> 00:42:29,966
So now?

550
00:42:31,812 --> 00:42:32,870
They have gotten used to the flat,..

551
00:42:32,947 --> 00:42:35,006
..now they want somebody
who will take care of it.

552
00:42:40,121 --> 00:42:42,885
You think It is crime to
play hockey in this country?

553
00:42:44,458 --> 00:42:51,387
No, no you can play politics,
cricket..

554
00:42:52,466 --> 00:42:53,933
you sure can play cricket!

555
00:42:55,836 --> 00:42:57,167
But hockey?

556
00:43:00,007 --> 00:43:01,133
It is a little difficult.

557
00:43:04,178 --> 00:43:06,043
Have you heard of
Mohammad bin Tuglaq?

558
00:43:06,847 --> 00:43:07,939
Is he cute?

559
00:43:08,983 --> 00:43:11,110
He was an emperor
- five hundred years ago.

560
00:43:12,153 --> 00:43:15,179
Crazy guy! Drove everyone mad.

561
00:43:16,857 --> 00:43:19,951
Stopped making gold and
silver coins for copper ones.

562
00:43:20,528 --> 00:43:22,052
Out in five years.

563
00:43:23,164 --> 00:43:25,189
That is how this
coach is going to go.

564
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:27,258
Thinks he can do anything.

565
00:43:27,868 --> 00:43:31,167
If you have such a sharp brain,
why do you not use when you play?

566
00:43:31,272 --> 00:43:35,003
He will be out in a few days.
The Association will kick him out.

567
00:43:35,910 --> 00:43:37,036
The system does not work like this.

568
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:42,246
The name suits him
- Tuglaq.

569
00:43:48,889 --> 00:43:51,517
Molly, Balbir,

570
00:43:53,060 --> 00:43:54,152
Komal,

571
00:43:57,965 --> 00:43:59,023
Bindia, Aliya -

572
00:44:00,034 --> 00:44:01,296
You are benched.

573
00:44:08,175 --> 00:44:11,338
So till we do not play by his
rules he will not let us play.

574
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:14,379
Tuglaq has lost it.

575
00:44:16,217 --> 00:44:18,481
Alright. We are no less.

576
00:44:19,053 --> 00:44:20,452
We will now play
only at the tournament.

577
00:44:22,256 --> 00:44:23,985
Sir! Hey sir!

578
00:44:28,362 --> 00:44:31,957
Sir, I would like to play too.

579
00:44:36,237 --> 00:44:37,465
Ok, Ok.. I am really sorry.

580
00:44:42,309 --> 00:44:43,401
Sorry

581
00:44:45,946 --> 00:44:48,107
Hey, ok enough.. come on,
accept my apology

582
00:44:52,019 --> 00:44:53,145
Accepting it, or should I hit you?

583
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:01,052
Sorry.

584
00:45:01,228 --> 00:45:04,197
Really sorry.

585
00:45:18,312 --> 00:45:19,973
Actually, she is not a bad player.

586
00:45:20,047 --> 00:45:22,607
When she whacks the ball hard,
it takes four girls to stop it.

587
00:45:22,983 --> 00:45:24,075
Admiring your enemy?

588
00:45:25,152 --> 00:45:26,278
Please do not pull my leg, didi.

589
00:45:26,353 --> 00:45:28,184
The coach has already
stopped us from playing.

590
00:45:28,255 --> 00:45:29,313
And then..

591
00:45:29,390 --> 00:45:30,448
Oh man..

592
00:45:32,993 --> 00:45:34,085
Oh.. oh!

593
00:45:37,164 --> 00:45:38,290
Come didi, let us play..

594
00:45:38,365 --> 00:45:40,629
If we play, we will play in our
own positions. Shut up and sit down.

595
00:45:48,008 --> 00:45:49,236
God, look there is
bull chasing her..

596
00:45:51,312 --> 00:45:54,179
You've already scored your forty
two goals. I haven't even started.

597
00:45:56,383 --> 00:45:59,011
Sir let me also get a
pardon from the memsahib.

598
00:46:06,193 --> 00:46:07,251
Hey missy, do you want
to accept my apology?

599
00:46:07,328 --> 00:46:08,488
Or do you prefer going to the jail?
- What?

600
00:46:08,562 --> 00:46:11,258
Look, if you do not
pardon me, I will fight you..

601
00:46:11,365 --> 00:46:14,300
in the fight either I will smash
your head or you will smash mine

602
00:46:14,401 --> 00:46:16,028
and we will have to go to jail..

603
00:46:16,103 --> 00:46:18,162
Anyway.. so tell me do you accept my
apology or should we go to the police?

604
00:46:38,058 --> 00:46:39,320
Time is up. Come on!

605
00:46:40,060 --> 00:46:41,391
Krishnaji, is anyone injured?

606
00:46:43,063 --> 00:46:44,291
Ok, now we will
reverse the play order.

607
00:46:44,365 --> 00:46:46,458
Defenders will attack
and attackers will defend.

608
00:46:47,134 --> 00:46:48,226
Sorry sir!

609
00:46:48,435 --> 00:46:51,268
Go attack! Ball on the centre.

610
00:46:53,707 --> 00:46:55,140
With all your heart! Come on!

611
00:47:13,427 --> 00:47:16,260
In the World Cup final,
the team lost to Pakistan.

612
00:47:17,298 --> 00:47:18,663
Wasn't he the team Captain?

613
00:47:19,099 --> 00:47:20,623
Captain?

614
00:47:21,402 --> 00:47:24,166
He was Pakistan's captain,
in an lndian uniform.

615
00:47:25,105 --> 00:47:26,163
What are you saying?

616
00:47:26,373 --> 00:47:28,273
It is not only me. Everyone says so.

617
00:47:29,109 --> 00:47:30,474
So how did they make him the coach?

618
00:47:31,178 --> 00:47:33,237
This is lndia. Anything is possible.

619
00:47:33,380 --> 00:47:35,405
He mentioned taking
us to the World Cup.

620
00:47:36,283 --> 00:47:38,308
He has already
sold his country once.

621
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:40,677
This time he may
just sell us as well!

622
00:47:45,426 --> 00:47:47,291
You guys will keep scrubbing
shoes for the rest of your life.

623
00:47:47,361 --> 00:47:49,158
Come, see who is downstairs.
- Who?

624
00:47:49,263 --> 00:47:50,389
Take a wild guess

625
00:47:51,131 --> 00:47:52,223
Is it a film star?

626
00:47:52,766 --> 00:47:54,324
Abhimanyu Singh!

627
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:56,432
You are kidding!

628
00:47:57,137 --> 00:47:58,195
What!

629
00:47:58,272 --> 00:48:01,400
Go see for yourself. Bro
is here to meet someone.

630
00:48:01,642 --> 00:48:02,700
He maybe your 'brother'!

631
00:48:03,143 --> 00:48:05,134
But who is he here for?
Come! Let us see!

632
00:48:05,212 --> 00:48:06,577
Let us go

633
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:29,367
She is a sly one.. did not
tell anyone she is his fianc?e..

634
00:48:29,803 --> 00:48:32,203
Coach has given her
leave till tomorrow morning..

635
00:48:32,306 --> 00:48:34,171
Wow!

636
00:48:43,484 --> 00:48:44,576
Leave till tomorrow morning.

637
00:48:45,552 --> 00:48:47,349
Why, whatever will
they do all night long?

638
00:48:54,528 --> 00:48:55,620
It is confirmed.

639
00:48:55,729 --> 00:48:57,253
They are making me the Vice Captain.

640
00:48:57,364 --> 00:48:58,490
Bullshit!

641
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:03,761
Really? I do not believe this!

642
00:49:05,272 --> 00:49:07,536
I knew it. How long will
these clowns hold out.

643
00:49:07,641 --> 00:49:09,700
Vice Captain of the
lndian frikkin cricket team!

644
00:49:09,843 --> 00:49:11,640
Now you watch how l
teach all these seniors.

645
00:49:12,312 --> 00:49:14,542
You see who rules this team now!

646
00:49:14,682 --> 00:49:17,845
Get out of the way everyone!
It is my turn now.

647
00:49:21,655 --> 00:49:23,213
Why do you not quit all this now?

648
00:49:24,224 --> 00:49:25,316
Quit what?

649
00:49:25,893 --> 00:49:27,485
Your silly stick & ball game

650
00:49:29,396 --> 00:49:32,763
Come on baby, forget about it now.

651
00:49:33,233 --> 00:49:34,291
Forget about it and do what?

652
00:49:34,368 --> 00:49:37,235
Do what? Live it up!

653
00:49:37,638 --> 00:49:39,731
Be with me! Travel
the world with me.

654
00:49:39,807 --> 00:49:41,832
Live life king-size, with the King.

655
00:49:42,676 --> 00:49:45,577
As the wife of the Vice
Captain of the lndian Cricket team!

656
00:49:45,646 --> 00:49:46,704
Wife?

657
00:49:47,414 --> 00:49:48,574
Oh, forgot to tell you.

658
00:49:50,884 --> 00:49:52,613
Had a chat with your dad
over drinks yesterday.

659
00:49:53,654 --> 00:49:55,281
I told him I am all for it.

660
00:49:55,355 --> 00:49:57,755
He said we do not want
to delay it anymore.

661
00:49:58,258 --> 00:49:59,657
So it is all fixed.

662
00:50:01,428 --> 00:50:02,725
Anyway, my career is all set.

663
00:50:02,796 --> 00:50:03,854
And what about my career?

664
00:50:04,264 --> 00:50:05,356
What?

665
00:50:05,432 --> 00:50:06,558
What about my career?

666
00:50:07,267 --> 00:50:09,633
What career?

667
00:50:09,703 --> 00:50:11,728
Abhi, I am in the lndian hockey team

668
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:15,275
Yeah but that is not a career,
Preeti. That is just a stupid game.

669
00:50:17,678 --> 00:50:18,770
So is cricket

670
00:50:18,912 --> 00:50:20,209
Preeti! I know you like to think of

671
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:22,908
your little dribbling and
stick work as a big thing.

672
00:50:23,283 --> 00:50:27,344
But let us face it
- it is not exactly cricket is it?

673
00:50:42,569 --> 00:50:44,400
Look at her enjoying herself!

674
00:50:46,673 --> 00:50:48,436
Damn it, let us go play.

675
00:50:51,311 --> 00:50:54,405
Come on, we have been rotting on
this same bench for the last 7 days.

676
00:50:54,515 --> 00:50:57,382
We are players, not
Association members who sit around.

677
00:50:57,484 --> 00:51:00,612
Come on. Come on!

678
00:51:05,759 --> 00:51:06,851
I will show him my game!

679
00:51:06,927 --> 00:51:08,258
If he is not forced to
make me a forward again,

680
00:51:08,328 --> 00:51:09,659
my name is not Bindia Naik.

681
00:51:10,631 --> 00:51:12,360
Or his is not Tuglaq.

682
00:51:19,907 --> 00:51:23,809
Sorry sir, it will not
happen again. We are sorry.

683
00:51:26,346 --> 00:51:27,438
Sorry

684
00:51:28,916 --> 00:51:31,612
Ok, you can play center half.

685
00:51:41,693 --> 00:51:44,821
Thank God sir. The
situation is under control now.

686
00:51:45,964 --> 00:51:50,424
No, Krishnaji. It is just
about to go out of control.

687
00:51:52,404 --> 00:51:56,932
Right! Left! Right! Left!

688
00:51:57,842 --> 00:52:01,642
Faster! Faster! Faster!
Run faster! Move.

689
00:52:01,846 --> 00:52:03,473
Faster! Faster! Run faster!
I mean FAST!

690
00:52:04,883 --> 00:52:06,680
Right, left, right! To the ball!

691
00:52:06,751 --> 00:52:09,720
Ok, let's go! Right! Left!

692
00:52:10,855 --> 00:52:15,918
Pass the ball! Make a pass! Pass,
pass, pass, pass, pass, pass PASS!

693
00:52:15,994 --> 00:52:17,052
Thank you.

694
00:52:18,663 --> 00:52:22,599
Trap and pass! Move the
ball ahead! Come on, move it!

695
00:52:23,468 --> 00:52:25,732
No player will keep the
ball for more than 5 seconds.

696
00:52:25,804 --> 00:52:28,796
Can you count? 5-4-3-2-1!

697
00:52:30,508 --> 00:52:34,911
Faster! Faster! Run faster!
I mean FAST! Quick, quick!

698
00:52:34,979 --> 00:52:36,469
Faster, faster,

699
00:52:38,683 --> 00:52:41,811
What is your problem? Do you not see
the ball, or are you afraid of it?

700
00:52:41,886 --> 00:52:43,581
Want to practice with a
tennis ball for a few days?

701
00:52:46,724 --> 00:52:51,889
Left, right, left!
Leave the ball, sit!

702
00:52:52,097 --> 00:52:53,962
Go, right!

703
00:52:56,367 --> 00:52:57,425
Go to hell!

704
00:52:58,870 --> 00:53:03,807
Trap, look and pass! Stop,
look and move it ahead..

705
00:53:03,875 --> 00:53:05,968
Do not move yourself forward.
Move the ball forward!

706
00:53:06,444 --> 00:53:08,469
Do one thing pick up the ball.

707
00:53:09,614 --> 00:53:13,983
PlCK lT UP! Put it in
your pocket and go home.

708
00:53:14,586 --> 00:53:17,384
Go play on the Chandigarh team
from tomorrow. No need to play here.

709
00:53:19,791 --> 00:53:24,785
And you! What are
you so angry about?

710
00:53:25,463 --> 00:53:26,794
Raise your game first

711
00:53:26,865 --> 00:53:27,923
and then raise your voice.

712
00:53:27,999 --> 00:53:30,695
Once more if I hear you shout out,

713
00:53:31,035 --> 00:53:32,400
you will be out!

714
00:53:40,645 --> 00:53:43,443
Hey you! Why are
you the center half?

715
00:53:43,848 --> 00:53:45,782
Because you are the senior
most player in the team.

716
00:53:45,850 --> 00:53:48,978
Your job is not to push the
forward line but to teach them.

717
00:53:50,155 --> 00:53:51,554
And one more thing.

718
00:53:52,790 --> 00:53:55,452
There can only be one
bully in every team.

719
00:53:56,427 --> 00:53:59,055
And for this team, it is me.

720
00:54:06,004 --> 00:54:07,904
You! Call this a pass?

721
00:54:09,607 --> 00:54:11,507
You are only good enough to
plough fields in your village.

722
00:54:11,576 --> 00:54:12,804
Forget about hockey!

723
00:54:14,445 --> 00:54:16,470
And why are you standing around?
Go get the ball!

724
00:54:19,184 --> 00:54:22,551
Right, left, right,

725
00:54:22,620 --> 00:54:27,819
Ieft, right, left! Relax!

726
00:54:28,092 --> 00:54:29,150
Nethra!

727
00:54:33,464 --> 00:54:36,991
Krishnaji! Give her water
and take her out! Quickly!

728
00:54:41,973 --> 00:54:46,103
So! You are lndia's best players!

729
00:54:47,078 --> 00:54:49,205
You will go to the
World Championship! Hah!

730
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:51,145
To raise lndia's flag!

731
00:54:52,016 --> 00:54:55,713
The Association is right.

732
00:54:56,054 --> 00:54:58,716
How will this lot ever play hockey!

733
00:54:59,924 --> 00:55:01,482
They cannot play as
one team. How the hell..

734
00:55:01,559 --> 00:55:02,617
..will they ever win
a World Championship!

735
00:55:03,094 --> 00:55:05,858
What are you staring at?
She is unconscious not dead!

736
00:55:06,731 --> 00:55:08,494
Krishnaji! Take her away! Out!

737
00:55:12,670 --> 00:55:13,864
I had said it on the first day.

738
00:55:14,772 --> 00:55:19,869
This team needs only those
who first play for lndia,

739
00:55:20,111 --> 00:55:23,012
then for their team mates

740
00:55:23,248 --> 00:55:27,207
and then if there is any
life left, for themselves.

741
00:55:29,020 --> 00:55:30,248
Let's start again.

742
00:55:32,690 --> 00:55:33,748
Right!

743
00:56:10,795 --> 00:56:13,025
So! Did you see what happens when
you let the coach think he is God!

744
00:56:16,768 --> 00:56:18,099
The blood will not stop.

745
00:56:19,704 --> 00:56:21,171
I warned you guys.

746
00:56:25,977 --> 00:56:27,035
Do you want to eat something?

747
00:56:30,014 --> 00:56:34,951
Wake up at 4am, run for 20 km. And
on the field, he does not let us play.

748
00:56:35,853 --> 00:56:36,911
What kind of a camp is this?

749
00:56:36,988 --> 00:56:38,046
Does it hurt a lot?

750
00:56:39,590 --> 00:56:40,682
Here! It hurts here.

751
00:56:41,826 --> 00:56:43,225
He insulted us!

752
00:56:44,262 --> 00:56:45,320
Hit with the ball!

753
00:56:46,230 --> 00:56:48,630
He knows damn well you
cannot speak English.

754
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:49,962
But you have to learn it!

755
00:56:50,034 --> 00:56:52,332
What you have not learnt in your
whole life, learn it in a day!

756
00:56:52,770 --> 00:56:53,828
Else get out of the team.

757
00:56:53,905 --> 00:56:55,133
Hey, he cannot throw you out!

758
00:56:55,239 --> 00:56:59,198
Do not worry, I will teach you.

759
00:56:59,711 --> 00:57:01,110
How can he cut you out of the team?

760
00:57:01,179 --> 00:57:03,170
What do you say Aliya?

761
00:57:03,881 --> 00:57:08,614
No freedom to eat, to move around
and when we play, he insults us.

762
00:57:09,987 --> 00:57:13,855
This is not a primary school. Each
girl is a National level player.

763
00:57:13,925 --> 00:57:16,291
A champion from her state
- that is why she is here.

764
00:57:16,794 --> 00:57:18,989
If there is any failure
amongst us, It is him.

765
00:57:19,630 --> 00:57:21,120
Sold his team out in the World Cup!

766
00:57:21,733 --> 00:57:23,291
Was thrown out of
the team, the country.

767
00:57:25,203 --> 00:57:27,194
What else can I say? I am
ashamed to say any more.

768
00:57:28,773 --> 00:57:29,899
Does it hurt?

769
00:57:32,977 --> 00:57:34,376
I have a spray..

770
00:57:40,184 --> 00:57:41,276
How is Nethra?

771
00:57:42,153 --> 00:57:46,180
OK. The doctor says she will be
back to practice in a couple of days.

772
00:57:47,692 --> 00:57:50,718
Practice? Have you lost it?

773
00:57:51,963 --> 00:57:53,294
From now on, there
will be no practice!

774
00:57:54,065 --> 00:57:56,329
There will be no
practice from tomorrow!

775
00:57:56,901 --> 00:57:57,959
Look here..

776
00:57:58,035 --> 00:58:04,406
You look here! We know you like him

777
00:58:04,909 --> 00:58:09,039
but you should also realise
that the team is on this side.

778
00:58:13,785 --> 00:58:15,844
It is time you choose
which side you're on.

779
00:58:16,788 --> 00:58:17,846
Yes.

780
00:58:18,923 --> 00:58:19,981
Definitely.

781
00:58:23,094 --> 00:58:24,254
I have thought about it.

782
00:58:25,196 --> 00:58:29,189
Now only the Association can
decide how this team should run.

783
00:58:30,067 --> 00:58:32,194
The way teams have
always run in this country.

784
00:58:32,970 --> 00:58:35,200
Or the way Tuglaq wants it!

785
00:58:43,448 --> 00:58:46,315
Let us sign this.

786
00:58:48,886 --> 00:58:53,721
Now, it is either
the Coach or our team.

787
00:58:56,227 --> 00:58:57,319
Sign this, Gul!

788
00:59:20,818 --> 00:59:21,876
Sir..

789
00:59:23,054 --> 00:59:25,022
Hmmm? Have some..

790
00:59:27,158 --> 00:59:28,420
Wasn't that too much?

791
00:59:31,762 --> 00:59:34,856
They are girls after all.
How much can you push them?

792
00:59:35,867 --> 00:59:37,767
If you look for the
strength of boys..

793
00:59:37,835 --> 00:59:40,303
I am not looking for strength.
I am looking for team spirit.

794
00:59:41,506 --> 00:59:44,134
You do not need strength to make
a team. You need team spirit.

795
00:59:45,776 --> 00:59:49,405
But sir, at this rate, you
will become their enemy.

796
00:59:49,947 --> 00:59:53,781
If by making me an enemy
they can become a team,

797
00:59:54,785 --> 00:59:57,049
then it is a small
price to pay, Krishnaji.

798
01:00:14,071 --> 01:00:15,402
Why are you not on the field?

799
01:00:17,808 --> 01:00:18,866
What is the matter?

800
01:00:20,912 --> 01:00:22,937
The team does not want
to practice with you.

801
01:00:23,347 --> 01:00:24,974
What rubbish!

802
01:00:27,818 --> 01:00:29,376
We want a new coach.

803
01:00:29,987 --> 01:00:31,386
I will give you one -

804
01:00:31,455 --> 01:00:34,185
Why Krishnaji? Why will you hit us?

805
01:00:34,825 --> 01:00:36,224
We are not the ones
who sold our country!

806
01:00:36,427 --> 01:00:37,951
Quiet!
- Sir!

807
01:00:47,438 --> 01:00:48,496
7 years.

808
01:00:50,341 --> 01:00:53,333
After 7 years I came back to hockey,
with the belief that this time

809
01:00:54,111 --> 01:00:58,946
I will beat the one thing that
defeated my team once and for all.

810
01:01:01,218 --> 01:01:04,847
But today, once again,
I have lost to it.

811
01:01:07,525 --> 01:01:10,460
You do not have a problem with me.

812
01:01:12,129 --> 01:01:13,926
You have a problem

813
01:01:15,266 --> 01:01:16,995
with the fact that instead of
making you play against each other,

814
01:01:17,068 --> 01:01:19,127
I am forcing you to
play with one another.

815
01:01:19,870 --> 01:01:20,996
Because I have forced
you to think about..

816
01:01:21,072 --> 01:01:22,903
..your team before you
think about yourself.

817
01:01:23,307 --> 01:01:26,868
Forced you to play for lndia
before you play for your own state.

818
01:01:30,114 --> 01:01:38,544
Fine. You have won. I have lost.

819
01:01:42,326 --> 01:01:45,386
But I am not sorry loosing to you.

820
01:01:46,364 --> 01:01:52,132
I am sorry I have
lost to my country.

821
01:01:53,904 --> 01:01:57,897
Which even after taking my blood,
sweat, my love,..

822
01:01:57,975 --> 01:02:02,571
..my life, does not believe
that I played for it once.

823
01:02:03,447 --> 01:02:06,382
And I will play for it all my life.

824
01:02:11,122 --> 01:02:14,285
I resign as the coach of this team.

825
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:11,170
Please, just think it over, Sir.

826
01:03:19,390 --> 01:03:21,381
You have worked so hard.

827
01:03:44,081 --> 01:03:46,515
Today is my last day in this camp.

828
01:03:49,153 --> 01:03:52,145
Before I leave, I am
taking the staff out for lunch.

829
01:03:53,390 --> 01:03:55,654
You are welcome to
join us if you wish.

830
01:03:59,597 --> 01:04:02,225
No obligations.

831
01:05:11,335 --> 01:05:15,431
Hi beautiful! Come on,
join us babes! Hey come on!

832
01:05:19,143 --> 01:05:23,273
She's red hot ya! Hey baby, hey!

833
01:05:29,286 --> 01:05:31,186
Harassing girls, are you? Try it!

834
01:05:31,255 --> 01:05:33,246
Hey! Hey, how..

835
01:05:34,225 --> 01:05:35,283
Balbir!

836
01:05:39,163 --> 01:05:41,495
Hit him!

837
01:06:45,729 --> 01:06:46,787
Do not let him go!

838
01:07:08,919 --> 01:07:11,717
Not from behind. Have guts
to attack from the front.

839
01:07:13,457 --> 01:07:17,757
You see, in hockey
there are no cowards.

840
01:07:43,887 --> 01:07:45,821
Is this a team or an army of devils?

841
01:07:47,524 --> 01:07:49,321
I told you, Krishnaji.

842
01:07:49,393 --> 01:07:53,489
It is not strength, but
spirit that makes a team.

843
01:07:55,366 --> 01:07:58,631
For the first time, l
have seen team spirit.

844
01:08:32,870 --> 01:08:38,399
Sir.. I was just..
just trying to say that..

845
01:08:39,843 --> 01:08:45,748
I mean.. Iet
sleeping dogs lie.. I mean..

846
01:08:46,784 --> 01:08:47,944
Hey tell him!

847
01:08:49,019 --> 01:08:53,854
Sir what she means.. what we all

848
01:09:07,871 --> 01:09:09,395
Tomorrow morning, 5 am sharp.

849
01:09:10,808 --> 01:09:14,437
I want everyone on the field.

850
01:09:19,683 --> 01:09:28,716
Chak De! India (Go lndia!)

851
01:09:50,746 --> 01:09:56,810
Y

852
01:09:57,086 --> 01:09:58,144
Come, come, come.

853
01:09:58,754 --> 01:10:01,188
We will run two
more kilometers today.

854
01:10:01,257 --> 01:10:02,315
Come on guys!

855
01:10:16,672 --> 01:10:18,663
Do something, do something

856
01:10:18,741 --> 01:10:21,005
My veins are bursting

857
01:10:21,077 --> 01:10:22,305
O please do something

858
01:10:25,614 --> 01:10:27,775
Do something, do something

859
01:10:27,850 --> 01:10:30,114
For talk and sermons bite the dust

860
01:10:30,186 --> 01:10:31,778
It is time to do something

861
01:10:34,323 --> 01:10:36,291
Be stubborn if that is what it takes

862
01:10:36,358 --> 01:10:38,792
Do or die
- all is at stake!

863
01:10:44,166 --> 01:10:48,762
Chak De! India (Go lndia!)

864
01:11:11,660 --> 01:11:16,154
In the fighting kite,
in the riot of might

865
01:11:16,232 --> 01:11:20,726
In the games and the fair,
in the bumpy trains so bare

866
01:11:20,803 --> 01:11:25,672
In the sweetness of sugarcane,
in the clothes of the rich or vain

867
01:11:25,741 --> 01:11:29,905
Seek and you will find,
heat that bricks bind

868
01:11:29,979 --> 01:11:34,040
A colour has emerged, and
it is spreading converged

869
01:11:34,116 --> 01:11:38,849
This colour of the reign,
is embedded in your veins

870
01:11:38,921 --> 01:11:43,290
Stand immovable, invincible,
obstinate in times of trouble

871
01:11:43,359 --> 01:11:51,733
Scraped and scarred,
move on even if marred

872
01:11:51,801 --> 01:11:54,133
Be stubborn if that is what it takes

873
01:11:54,203 --> 01:11:56,330
Do or die
- all is at stake!

874
01:12:02,144 --> 01:12:06,240
Chak De! India (Go lndia!)

875
01:12:29,939 --> 01:12:30,997
How can you go?

876
01:12:31,073 --> 01:12:32,131
Why?

877
01:12:32,741 --> 01:12:33,969
Because we are getting married!

878
01:12:34,076 --> 01:12:35,134
What?

879
01:12:35,311 --> 01:12:38,109
You can not go on the 25th, we
are getting married on the 2nd

880
01:12:38,180 --> 01:12:39,238
What?

881
01:12:39,315 --> 01:12:40,976
I have fixed the dates after
discussing it with your parents

882
01:12:41,050 --> 01:12:42,745
And me? Do you not need
to discuss this with me?

883
01:12:42,818 --> 01:12:43,910
What is the point of discussing it?

884
01:12:43,986 --> 01:12:45,453
You want to get
married to me, do you not?

885
01:12:46,789 --> 01:12:49,019
But, not like this! I need time.

886
01:12:49,091 --> 01:12:50,183
What for?

887
01:12:50,259 --> 01:12:51,749
I am playing for
the World Cup, Abhi!

888
01:12:51,827 --> 01:12:53,761
Have you gone insane?

889
01:12:54,063 --> 01:12:56,224
You want to postpone our
wedding for the World Cup?

890
01:12:57,132 --> 01:12:58,997
What if it was your World cup?

891
01:12:59,068 --> 01:13:00,330
That is a totally different.

892
01:13:00,402 --> 01:13:01,892
It is the Cricket World cup.

893
01:13:01,971 --> 01:13:03,063
It is really important.

894
01:13:04,240 --> 01:13:06,299
This is really important.. for me

895
01:13:06,375 --> 01:13:07,933
More important than our marriage?

896
01:13:08,944 --> 01:13:10,275
I have to go. Good night!

897
01:13:12,481 --> 01:13:14,949
Go. Go play the World cup..

898
01:13:15,017 --> 01:13:17,417
If you loose you
will become my wife.

899
01:13:17,887 --> 01:13:20,515
If you win, you
will become my wife..

900
01:13:21,257 --> 01:13:22,781
It is not like when you come back,

901
01:13:22,858 --> 01:13:26,350
the whole country
will remember your name.

902
01:13:28,831 --> 01:13:30,958
One thing I promise
you Mr. Abhimanyu..

903
01:13:31,400 --> 01:13:33,493
This will definitely happen.

904
01:13:38,407 --> 01:13:40,102
The team is shaping up well, sir.

905
01:13:41,110 --> 01:13:42,236
The captain of this
team will be Vidya.

906
01:13:45,314 --> 01:13:46,508
Congratulations, Vidya!

907
01:13:58,994 --> 01:14:00,120
Give it a break.

908
01:14:00,429 --> 01:14:01,919
I have nothing to say to you.

909
01:14:02,231 --> 01:14:04,825
For the first time something
good is happening. Take part in it.

910
01:14:04,900 --> 01:14:05,958
You already did!

911
01:14:10,005 --> 01:14:11,905
The way Bindia is using her brain..

912
01:14:12,374 --> 01:14:14,399
Do you think it is right
for her to be on the team?

913
01:14:15,477 --> 01:14:17,843
I do not know Krishnaji..
but it is also not right..

914
01:14:17,913 --> 01:14:21,041
..to keep the most
experienced player off the team.

915
01:14:21,917 --> 01:14:24,249
I do not think we can..
deal with her

916
01:14:26,355 --> 01:14:29,290
We cannot win without her either.

917
01:14:31,193 --> 01:14:33,889
Is this not your
World Cup silver medal?

918
01:14:35,431 --> 01:14:36,489
What are you doing with it?

919
01:14:38,567 --> 01:14:41,001
Trying to scrub it into gold.

920
01:14:43,038 --> 01:14:45,268
If I ever need to sell
it in the flea market,

921
01:14:46,275 --> 01:14:47,469
at least I will get a good price.

922
01:14:53,148 --> 01:14:58,609
Mr. Kabir, it is best if you
forget about the World Cup.

923
01:14:59,888 --> 01:15:01,446
And tell these girls as well.

924
01:15:01,523 --> 01:15:03,252
The ones who you have
given such high hopes too.

925
01:15:04,460 --> 01:15:07,395
But our deal was to train
this team for the World Cup.

926
01:15:08,564 --> 01:15:12,364
It was not like we signed on a legal
document you cannot hold us up to it.

927
01:15:12,501 --> 01:15:14,594
You discussed it in
front of me, Mr. Tripathi.

928
01:15:15,337 --> 01:15:17,328
We will discuss it in
front of you once more.

929
01:15:18,073 --> 01:15:20,200
Look, on one hand,

930
01:15:20,275 --> 01:15:24,041
there is the lndian men's team
which at least gets a bronze medal.

931
01:15:24,546 --> 01:15:27,037
And on the other, there
is this team of misfits.

932
01:15:27,449 --> 01:15:30,612
But this team is
ready for the World Cup!

933
01:15:31,220 --> 01:15:34,121
Tomorrow if they are ready for
the moon, we should send them? Huh?

934
01:15:34,390 --> 01:15:36,153
This team can not go the World Cup.

935
01:15:36,225 --> 01:15:37,283
It is decided.

936
01:15:37,960 --> 01:15:39,928
Be honest. Tell us
you are taking money..

937
01:15:39,995 --> 01:15:42,520
..from the Women's team
to give to the Men's team.

938
01:15:43,999 --> 01:15:45,364
You guys are athletes.

939
01:15:46,135 --> 01:15:49,161
Why do you want to get involved
in things that do not concern you?

940
01:15:50,272 --> 01:15:51,330
Shall we?

941
01:15:52,241 --> 01:15:53,299
But Mr. Tripathi!

942
01:15:54,943 --> 01:15:57,639
Let us have a match.

943
01:15:57,713 --> 01:15:58,941
What?

944
01:16:01,350 --> 01:16:06,014
Yes. Let us have a match.
Between my team and your team.

945
01:16:07,089 --> 01:16:09,956
You mean Men's
team v/s Women's team?

946
01:16:11,560 --> 01:16:14,154
I mean between my
team and your team.

947
01:16:17,099 --> 01:16:21,058
If we loose, we loose. But
if we win, then - World Cup.

948
01:16:24,139 --> 01:16:25,606
Think about what you
are saying, Mr. Kabir.

949
01:16:26,208 --> 01:16:29,075
Do not make Pandavas' (lndian
mythological characters) bet

950
01:16:29,378 --> 01:16:31,175
You will be left standing naked.

951
01:16:31,246 --> 01:16:33,271
It has already happened to you once.

952
01:16:36,285 --> 01:16:39,186
All right. Day after morning.

953
01:16:40,189 --> 01:16:42,419
But we need time to train!

954
01:16:42,491 --> 01:16:45,187
Day after
- yes or no?

955
01:16:45,260 --> 01:16:46,318
Mr. Tripathi..

956
01:16:46,395 --> 01:16:48,260
Day after morning. We
will meet on the field.

957
01:16:54,403 --> 01:16:56,428
Even your team needs to practice

958
01:16:56,505 --> 01:16:57,563
Come out..

959
01:17:09,384 --> 01:17:10,442
Shit!

960
01:17:11,353 --> 01:17:14,322
We will never win. And
by some chance, if we do..

961
01:17:14,389 --> 01:17:17,586
Chance! Huh!

962
01:17:18,660 --> 01:17:21,026
Imagine how many
goals we will loose by.

963
01:17:21,096 --> 01:17:24,065
And once we lose,
it is over forever!

964
01:17:29,538 --> 01:17:30,766
What have you done, sir?

965
01:17:30,839 --> 01:17:32,534
We are like sitting ducks.

966
01:17:32,608 --> 01:17:37,568
Ducks? I have belief in this team.

967
01:17:38,247 --> 01:17:40,044
Does this team believe in itself?

968
01:17:41,250 --> 01:17:43,081
Come on! Let us go.

969
01:17:46,688 --> 01:17:52,149
Look, you are not
playing against these boys.

970
01:17:52,227 --> 01:17:54,092
Come on, get ready! Hurry!

971
01:17:56,732 --> 01:17:58,290
Do not think
- here let me have it.

972
01:17:59,268 --> 01:18:02,726
Do not think you are
playing against 1 6 boys.

973
01:18:05,407 --> 01:18:08,501
You are fighting
everyone in this country

974
01:18:09,211 --> 01:18:12,237
who thinks girls can
never match up to men,

975
01:18:13,782 --> 01:18:16,410
cannot hold a job as well as a man,

976
01:18:17,085 --> 01:18:19,485
cannot make decisions like men..

977
01:18:21,523 --> 01:18:25,391
You are fighting each
fool who has forgotten that

978
01:18:25,460 --> 01:18:27,758
if a girl has given life to him,

979
01:18:28,697 --> 01:18:32,793
she can do anything. Anything.

980
01:18:36,572 --> 01:18:39,564
It is a huge match
perhaps bigger than you or me.

981
01:18:40,609 --> 01:18:44,340
And that is why I should be
telling you play fearlessly,

982
01:18:44,713 --> 01:18:50,709
play together, play
with all your might,

983
01:18:50,786 --> 01:18:52,378
play like this, play like that..

984
01:18:52,454 --> 01:18:57,118
but I will just say one thing

985
01:19:02,397 --> 01:19:03,455
Chak De!

986
01:19:26,655 --> 01:19:27,713
Do they know how to play?

987
01:19:27,789 --> 01:19:29,484
Good morning, ladies & gentlemen!

988
01:19:29,558 --> 01:19:30,616
Good morning sir!

989
01:20:08,159 --> 01:20:09,217
But sir! That was a foul!

990
01:20:46,998 --> 01:20:48,761
Very good! Well played!

991
01:21:20,398 --> 01:21:22,025
Good job boys!

992
01:21:22,100 --> 01:21:24,728
Come on! Come on girls! Well played!

993
01:21:33,945 --> 01:21:37,073
Don't tire yourselves running!
Smaller passes!

994
01:21:37,148 --> 01:21:38,672
Should we stop if
you have had enough,..

995
01:21:38,750 --> 01:21:41,014
..Mr. Kabir? Or do
you still want to play?

996
01:21:41,086 --> 01:21:42,144
The match isn't over yet.

997
01:21:42,320 --> 01:21:45,255
Your girls could not
even reach the boys' half.

998
01:21:45,323 --> 01:21:46,381
You cannot expect
anything from them.

999
01:21:46,458 --> 01:21:47,686
Mr. Yadav what..

1000
01:21:49,127 --> 01:21:50,685
Well, he's right Krishnaji.

1001
01:21:51,096 --> 01:21:54,122
We always said it - These are
good old fashioned lndian girls -

1002
01:21:54,199 --> 01:21:57,327
How will they run around
in shorts and mini - skirts?

1003
01:21:57,402 --> 01:21:58,869
Yes, Mr. Yadav,
tell them like it is.

1004
01:21:58,937 --> 01:22:02,202
What can you do? You will fall
flat on your faces, you'll see!
