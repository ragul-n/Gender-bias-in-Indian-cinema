1
00:00:44,244 --> 00:00:48,203
"Remember, Kanak Sharma is a
candidate backed by Radhe Bhaiyya!"

2
00:00:48,648 --> 00:00:50,843
We must elect Radhe
Bhaiyya's candidate...

3
00:00:51,117 --> 00:00:54,416
as the general secretary of
our union once again this year

4
00:00:57,957 --> 00:01:01,518
Here are the benefits if
Radhe Bhaiyya's candidate wins

5
00:01:01,795 --> 00:01:05,697
You can go watch a movie and your
attendance will still be recorded

6
00:01:06,032 --> 00:01:08,500
You can carry notes to cheat
in the exams

7
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:12,034
No action will be taken
for winking at pretty girls

8
00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:15,373
The famous dance party
from Delhi has already arrived...

9
00:01:15,608 --> 00:01:17,974
all arrangements for the
celebration are in place

10
00:01:18,111 --> 00:01:20,409
We're only waiting for
the results to be declared

11
00:01:21,948 --> 00:01:24,416
I've spent so much
in this election

12
00:01:24,851 --> 00:01:29,015
"If I lose this election,
I'll have to commit suicide"

13
00:01:29,456 --> 00:01:31,424
"Hey, Hemant bhaiyya...
why will you commit suicide?"

14
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:34,560
It's Kanak Sharma who's going to die.
I'll murder the bastard

15
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:37,797
Are you out of your mind?
Why do you keep talking nonsense?

16
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:40,430
Alex has told me.
I'll bump off the bastard

17
00:01:40,633 --> 00:01:43,761
"Tiwari, skip the blah-blah"

18
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:46,004
You aren't supposed to think aloud

19
00:01:52,178 --> 00:01:53,110
Radhe!

20
00:03:00,613 --> 00:03:04,140
Sweetheart...

21
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:07,812
sweetheart...

22
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:11,888
"my heart says, sweetheart..."

23
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:14,486
come and meet me...

24
00:03:14,928 --> 00:03:17,488
don't ever go far away from me

25
00:03:31,578 --> 00:03:33,011
"No, no, no..."

26
00:03:33,179 --> 00:03:35,545
I'm not falling in love...

27
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:38,114
don't steal my heart...

28
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:40,878
don't get closer to me

29
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,354
"Look, let me tell you..."

30
00:04:25,131 --> 00:04:30,364
"in love, when you say no,
it means yes"

31
00:04:38,077 --> 00:04:42,605
"Pretty girls' excuses are ages old,
no one has ever figured them out"

32
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:45,607
"They won't say a word,
their eyes do the talking..."

33
00:04:45,885 --> 00:04:48,410
and they steal our hearts

34
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:35,957
You'd better admit it...

35
00:05:36,936 --> 00:05:41,873
"those who fall in love,
shed tears"

36
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:52,478
"Some gain, some lose,
some smile, some cry..."

37
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:54,846
"some awake,
some sleep every moment"

38
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:57,488
"It stokes the fires,
it causes you to pine..."

39
00:05:57,757 --> 00:06:00,123
it torments you so

40
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,890
"No, no, no..."

41
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:07,097
Sweetheart...

42
00:06:07,266 --> 00:06:09,427
"my heart says, sweetheart..."

43
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:12,236
come and meet me...

44
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:14,632
don't ever go far away from me

45
00:08:08,454 --> 00:08:11,423
"The first breeze of dawn,
awakens the world..."

46
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:15,092
the bees have started to hum...

47
00:08:15,361 --> 00:08:18,762
the birds take to their wings...

48
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:22,093
"colourful decorations
mark every courtyard"

49
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:25,564
For blessings...

50
00:08:26,105 --> 00:08:29,131
for fulfillment...

51
00:08:29,609 --> 00:08:36,071
"at Your feet, Radha offers
flowers, O Krishna"

52
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:41,244
"You are the one
in my heart..."

53
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:44,988
O Krishna...

54
00:08:47,727 --> 00:08:54,826
The colourful Krishna

55
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:15,146
"I'm crazed in love,
I have lost my senses..."

56
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:18,615
"You are the one
I am devoted to"

57
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:21,822
"At Your doorstep,
all day and night..."

58
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:25,492
"it's Your name
I always chant"

59
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:29,231
"Whatever I possess,
is Yours..."

60
00:09:29,602 --> 00:09:32,628
"to You, I dedicate my life"

61
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:39,875
"at Your feet, Radha offers
flowers, O Krishna"

62
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:45,213
"You are the one
in my heart..."

63
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:48,887
O Krishna...

64
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:56,550
The sound of your daughter's
melodious voice every morning...

65
00:09:56,996 --> 00:09:59,897
erases all our worries

66
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:03,897
"You finished your 12th. What have you
planned to do next, my child?"

67
00:10:04,303 --> 00:10:07,898
She's going to attend college now.
- What will she gain in college?

68
00:10:08,174 --> 00:10:10,472
She's going to be married after all

69
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:14,940
My son-in-law to-be has expressed
the wish that she studies further

70
00:10:15,681 --> 00:10:17,649
"I see. Is that true, Rameshwar?"

71
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:23,244
"Yes, Uncle. All I could learn
at the tutelage was the Vedas"

72
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:26,458
At least she must be a graduate

73
00:10:26,892 --> 00:10:29,952
So you want a wife
who speaks English!

74
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:33,557
"But you know how things are
at the college, don't you?"

75
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,628
Kids in Agra study less
and watch movies more

76
00:10:36,936 --> 00:10:40,804
Nirjara is not like that.
And she has Indu for company

77
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,174
She'll take the 7:34 a.m.
Frontier Mail every morning

78
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:46,003
The college is near the station.
As soon as her classes are over...

79
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:49,008
she'll take the
16:34 express train back

80
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:52,818
Away from a world of hatred...

81
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:56,019
in a world of love...

82
00:10:56,288 --> 00:11:00,247
"may you find happiness,
my friend..."

83
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:06,955
When an animals kill man...

84
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:19,343
"And now man has
slain an animal..."

85
00:11:21,113 --> 00:11:24,014
why is the world quiet?

86
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:27,341
Give me that pickle

87
00:11:30,122 --> 00:11:33,819
I'm told there was a furore yesterday.
You got into a fight at the college

88
00:11:34,126 --> 00:11:37,027
"Fight? No, brother.
I broke their legs"

89
00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:41,627
"If I had not got there on time,
Alex's men would have killed Kanak"

90
00:11:42,068 --> 00:11:44,832
Why do you need to interfere
in someone else's affairs?

91
00:11:45,137 --> 00:11:49,540
"He's a friend. Would I remain silent,
if someone came to beat you up?"

92
00:11:50,276 --> 00:11:52,710
"Besides, it's my college"

93
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:56,741
It was! How many years is it
since you passed out of college?

94
00:11:57,249 --> 00:12:00,082
But you still hang out there.
For no rhyme or reason

95
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:03,681
Will you spend the life of a vagabond
or find some work to do?

96
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:06,149
Enough. Let him have
the breakfast in peace

97
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:09,828
"Give me a puri, sister-in-law.
- Why one? Help yourself to 40"

98
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:13,362
Feed him the free food and make
a stronger bull out of him

99
00:12:13,766 --> 00:12:15,734
So he can keep attacking everyone!

100
00:12:19,105 --> 00:12:23,974
"Here's your puri, your bread...
and your milk"

101
00:12:27,113 --> 00:12:29,081
Don't waste the food

102
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:34,720
Radhe...
- No

103
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,885
"Listen, Radhe...
- No, sister-in-law"

104
00:12:37,289 --> 00:12:41,089
See that? You made him get up
while he was eating!

105
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:45,089
The skies haven't fallen.
You're the one who has spoilt him

106
00:12:45,798 --> 00:12:47,766
He goes around with that
horrible hair of his...

107
00:12:48,134 --> 00:12:50,898
and makes a few others
hang out with him too

108
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:54,537
I don't know what he's
going to do in life

109
00:12:59,845 --> 00:13:01,870
Radhe's an old student
of the college

110
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:06,082
He rags the new students
with his friends

111
00:13:06,485 --> 00:13:09,181
Don't look at them!
Just keep walking

112
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:12,750
"Look, Radhe.
There's a fresher with Indu"

113
00:13:15,394 --> 00:13:16,622
Listen

114
00:13:23,068 --> 00:13:24,592
Come here

115
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:29,939
Not you. Go to your class
and get on with your studies

116
00:13:36,515 --> 00:13:37,709
First year?

117
00:13:42,354 --> 00:13:44,322
B.A. Pass course

118
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:48,558
Can't you say good morning
to your seniors?

119
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:53,157
Not like that. Say it like
an attentive soldier

120
00:14:01,273 --> 00:14:03,764
Keep saluting me like that
every time you pass by

121
00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:06,143
All right.
- What's that?

122
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:18,816
And what's this?
- A peacock feather

123
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:21,751
I can see that. But why have you
kept it in a book?

124
00:14:21,994 --> 00:14:25,157
"Kept in a notebook,
it doubles"

125
00:14:25,931 --> 00:14:27,899
Must be laying eggs!

126
00:14:34,406 --> 00:14:36,340
What's in the box?

127
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:44,678
Wow! Puri and a vegetable dish

128
00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:50,483
Nice

129
00:14:55,261 --> 00:14:57,729
"No, don't wipe your hands
on my shirt!"

130
00:14:58,264 --> 00:15:00,027
"What are you doing, Radhe!"

131
00:15:03,202 --> 00:15:05,966
Don't wipe it with that.
It'll be a sin

132
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:29,227
What's your name?
- Nirjara Rao

133
00:15:30,362 --> 00:15:34,230
Meaning?
- Meaning? It's my name

134
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:37,633
It's very a difficult name.
So I asked for the meaning

135
00:15:38,304 --> 00:15:40,238
I don't know

136
00:15:40,572 --> 00:15:43,564
Who named you?
- My mother did

137
00:15:44,176 --> 00:15:46,610
So ask your mother.
- She's dead

138
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:52,680
Is your father alive?
- Yes

139
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:55,682
So ask him when you
come tomorrow

140
00:15:56,822 --> 00:15:59,290
All right.
- Thanks

141
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:04,496
You saved me from sinning

142
00:16:07,266 --> 00:16:09,029
The lunch-box

143
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:25,272
"When that peacock feather doubles,
give me one!"

144
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:42,297
"Father, why did Ma
name me Nirjara?"

145
00:16:45,637 --> 00:16:48,299
Because your mother
loved my mother

146
00:16:48,707 --> 00:16:52,006
Your grandma.
Her name was Nirjara Devi too

147
00:16:52,378 --> 00:16:54,608
"What does it mean, father?"

148
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:57,345
Why do you need to know today?

149
00:16:57,716 --> 00:17:03,279
"Tell me, father. Everybody asks me.
They even tease me"

150
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:07,559
Nirjara means...

151
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:18,530
Money?

152
00:17:21,073 --> 00:17:22,597
Here you are

153
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:33,010
Chandu... give her a cup of tea

154
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:34,852
"Very well, Radhe bhaiyya"

155
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:38,913
Nut!

156
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:42,360
Have patience.
I'm giving it to you

157
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:45,693
Leave that alone.
What are you doing?

158
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:50,696
Here you are...

159
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:53,166
stop bothering me

160
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:02,739
"Forgive me, Radhe!
It was a mistake!"

161
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:08,410
I'll never tease a girl again!
I beg at your feet

162
00:19:08,847 --> 00:19:11,748
Please forgive me...
just once!

163
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:20,425
Drink

164
00:19:21,593 --> 00:19:23,686
Drink it up. Go on

165
00:19:27,466 --> 00:19:30,765
"Binti, if you're going upstairs,
wake up your uncle"

166
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:34,098
"Let him sleep, Papa.
Today's a Sunday"

167
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:37,100
"Today's his birthday, silly!
- Birthday!"

168
00:19:37,376 --> 00:19:41,278
Wake him up quickly. We'll get ready
and go to Brindavan for prayers

169
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:47,644
"How much money, mister?"

170
00:19:47,786 --> 00:19:50,482
"No, sir... how can we take any money
from Radhe bhaiyya?"

171
00:19:58,564 --> 00:19:59,895
"Hello, Radhe bhaiyya!"

172
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:07,261
See your brother-in-law's reputation?

173
00:20:07,673 --> 00:20:09,607
The flower seller won't
take money from him!

174
00:20:09,908 --> 00:20:12,843
People salute him out of fear.
- They respect me...

175
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:15,545
and you don't like that either.
- Now look. These things...

176
00:20:15,814 --> 00:20:18,214
Do you want me to go away?
- How will you go away?

177
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:22,211
You're an amazing man!
It's Radhe's birthday today

178
00:20:22,588 --> 00:20:26,547
"At least stop taunting him today.
Come, let's go"

179
00:20:27,593 --> 00:20:32,895
O Revered Guru...

180
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:40,895
deign to bless me

181
00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:50,939
"Grant unto me
knowledge and education"

182
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,212
"My child, make some porridge.
Rameshwar likes it"

183
00:21:32,491 --> 00:21:34,118
"Very well, father"

184
00:21:36,662 --> 00:21:38,630
In whose name is the
offering to be made?

185
00:21:38,764 --> 00:21:41,198
In the name of Radhe Mohan

186
00:21:46,104 --> 00:21:47,298
Excuse me...

187
00:21:48,707 --> 00:21:50,641
please come here

188
00:21:54,713 --> 00:21:56,681
Hello.
- Hello

189
00:21:56,915 --> 00:21:59,349
So you are the priest's daughter?

190
00:21:59,718 --> 00:22:03,154
"Yes, we are Brahmins"

191
00:22:03,855 --> 00:22:07,757
"My father says, our forefathers used
to be priests in this very temple"

192
00:22:08,126 --> 00:22:11,960
I know nothing about my forefathers.
What I do know is that...

193
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:15,198
my great grandfather used to play
hockey for the English team

194
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:19,330
My grandfather played hockey
with Gyanchand and Dhyanchand

195
00:22:19,604 --> 00:22:24,541
"In extras, too. My father broke
his thumb while playing football"

196
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:26,439
So he took to selling
hockey sticks

197
00:22:26,712 --> 00:22:29,681
Is that why you beat everyone
with hockey sticks?

198
00:22:32,484 --> 00:22:34,281
What?
- What happened?

199
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,449
Something in my eye

200
00:22:38,724 --> 00:22:41,022
Here... give it some heat

201
00:22:45,797 --> 00:22:48,698
You found out what your name means?
- Yes

202
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:52,492
What is it?
- Nirjara

203
00:22:55,774 --> 00:22:59,210
Jar means death.
So Nirjara means lmmortality

204
00:23:01,513 --> 00:23:03,481
There's a religious
interpretation too

205
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:06,946
One's soul is tied to his deeds

206
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:12,016
Deep meditation frees the soul.
And that is called Nirjara

207
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:19,856
Here you are.
- What's that?

208
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:21,430
Gujia (a snack)

209
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:30,307
Got a few more?
- Yes

210
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:32,406
For my niece

211
00:23:35,781 --> 00:23:38,443
Where did you buy it?
- Not bought it. I myself made it

212
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:41,018
Both are nice

213
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:43,514
The Gujia and your name too

214
00:23:43,989 --> 00:23:45,752
Your name is nice too

215
00:23:46,792 --> 00:23:50,091
Radhe Mohan is another name
for Lord Krishna. You know that?

216
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:55,426
"Your attention,
ladies and gentlemen!"

217
00:23:55,634 --> 00:23:57,761
"She first said"ras"(juice)"

218
00:23:58,069 --> 00:24:00,299
"She then said"gul"(rose)"

219
00:24:00,705 --> 00:24:02,400
"And then she said"le"(take)"

220
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:10,737
"Listen, ras, gul and le..."

221
00:24:11,316 --> 00:24:14,752
that's how she broke up
the rasgollah!

222
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:20,087
Thank you very much

223
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:35,572
She's now going to bore us
to death with a poem

224
00:24:40,846 --> 00:24:42,780
Clear your throat!

225
00:24:50,188 --> 00:24:52,816
"Stars are nothing
but the Sun of the night"

226
00:24:53,358 --> 00:24:55,485
"Like the West
is also East"

227
00:24:55,894 --> 00:24:58,829
We get that!
So what happens next?

228
00:25:02,868 --> 00:25:05,302
"Go on, Nirjara"

229
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:08,203
They won't let me speak

230
00:25:08,607 --> 00:25:13,806
"North in South,
East in West... so what's new?"

231
00:25:30,128 --> 00:25:34,565
I've taken the trouble
of coming to the stage...

232
00:25:35,233 --> 00:25:37,827
because I've liked her
poem very much

233
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:43,835
"And since I have liked it,
you will like it too. Get that?"

234
00:25:44,809 --> 00:25:48,540
Those who understand will
quietly listen to the recital...

235
00:25:48,914 --> 00:25:52,213
"and those who don't,
will still sit quietly and listen"

236
00:25:53,585 --> 00:25:55,678
Everything's under control.
Please come

237
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:58,553
Clap for her

238
00:26:04,529 --> 00:26:06,827
"Stars are nothing
but the Suns of the night"

239
00:26:07,265 --> 00:26:09,825
"Like the West
is also the East"

240
00:26:10,302 --> 00:26:12,827
"The Earth is the daughter
of the Sun..."

241
00:26:13,138 --> 00:26:15,538
"suspended on a bed
in the skies"

242
00:26:15,974 --> 00:26:18,670
"The Sun is an eye-full
of light..."

243
00:26:19,311 --> 00:26:21,245
spread everywhere around

244
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:24,882
Where are my...

245
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:48,232
Radhe-ji... my recital is over

246
00:28:22,067 --> 00:28:30,031
"How I love meeting you,
and talking to you"

247
00:28:41,853 --> 00:28:45,016
"What's all this about
and why... I don't know"

248
00:28:45,423 --> 00:28:48,517
But whatever it is...

249
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:53,023
I love it

250
00:28:54,132 --> 00:29:02,039
"How I love meeting you,
and talking to you"

251
00:29:03,842 --> 00:29:07,334
"What's all this about
and why... I don't know"

252
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:11,182
But whatever it is...

253
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:15,781
I love it

254
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:51,077
"Little things about you,
every meeting we have..."

255
00:29:51,556 --> 00:29:55,617
"they torment me,
when you're not with me"

256
00:30:01,065 --> 00:30:04,228
"What's all this about
and why... I don't know"

257
00:30:04,602 --> 00:30:07,901
But whatever it is...

258
00:30:09,073 --> 00:30:12,474
I love it

259
00:30:55,520 --> 00:31:00,355
"You give a fragrance
to my days and nights..."

260
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:05,159
"yours is the name
etched on my heart"

261
00:31:10,235 --> 00:31:13,671
"What's all this about
and why... I don't know"

262
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:17,166
But whatever it is...

263
00:31:18,243 --> 00:31:21,542
I love it

264
00:31:22,914 --> 00:31:30,878
"How I love meeting you,
and talking to you"

265
00:31:48,706 --> 00:31:50,606
"Radhe...?
- Yes, sis-in-law?"

266
00:31:50,975 --> 00:31:53,273
What are you doing here
at this hour of the night?

267
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:57,275
I couldn't go to sleep.
So I thought I'd read a book

268
00:31:58,016 --> 00:32:00,246
Why do you need a book
so late in the night?

269
00:32:01,352 --> 00:32:02,876
Say something!

270
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:04,221
Funny!

271
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:07,417
Stop here

272
00:32:10,962 --> 00:32:13,226
Sister...

273
00:32:13,665 --> 00:32:16,225
haven't your husband
and Rahul come?

274
00:32:22,307 --> 00:32:24,070
This is the limit

275
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:29,076
"How can he separate a child from
his mother, for the sake of money?"

276
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:34,278
"God! Atmaram used to make demands
of 20 and 30,000 rupees earlier"

277
00:32:34,652 --> 00:32:36,449
"He's asking for 200,000 now"

278
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:41,788
"Remaining silent
will not do, Guruji"

279
00:32:42,327 --> 00:32:44,295
We'll have to do something about it

280
00:32:44,662 --> 00:32:48,029
There's no need to do anything.
I don't want to live with that man

281
00:32:49,367 --> 00:32:53,303
I'll find some work here...
I'll help you in your work

282
00:32:53,705 --> 00:32:57,300
I'll raise the money in a few days
and bring back my Rahul

283
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:01,270
My son must be so harassed

284
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,412
Gardener...

285
00:33:12,256 --> 00:33:13,883
Is this 7\32?

286
00:33:14,592 --> 00:33:16,082
"Yes, it is. So?"

287
00:33:16,361 --> 00:33:20,024
I want to meet the one stays here.
- I'm the one. Go on

288
00:33:20,365 --> 00:33:23,095
Not you. We wish to see Radhe Sir

289
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:27,096
What for?
- We'll tell him that

290
00:33:27,372 --> 00:33:29,306
Just go and tell him that
there's someone here to see him

291
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,937
All right

292
00:33:31,376 --> 00:33:33,674
Sit down inside.
I'll call him

293
00:33:34,312 --> 00:33:35,404
Who's it?

294
00:33:35,546 --> 00:33:37,673
Are my pants all right?

295
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:55,366
Go on

296
00:34:01,305 --> 00:34:03,136
So what brings you here?
- Actually...

297
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:07,503
What's her name?
- Indu

298
00:34:07,845 --> 00:34:10,678
"Indu-ji, will you please
let her speak? Go on"

299
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:12,914
Actually...
- Say nothing

300
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:17,081
"First tell me what you will have,
Tea, coffee, a cold-drink?"

301
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:20,084
"Samosas, biscuits...?
- Nothing"

302
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:23,360
lmpossible. This is the first time
you've come to my house. Have something

303
00:34:23,594 --> 00:34:25,084
Aslam...
- Yes?

304
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:27,830
Get some Diet Coke
and samosas from Balwant

305
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:31,027
He makes excellent samosas.
And listen...

306
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:34,701
give me a cigarette.
Mine are over

307
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,738
Here you are.
- Come back soon

308
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:41,671
Aslam... come here

309
00:34:43,448 --> 00:34:45,416
"Yes, brother?
- Who are they?"

310
00:34:45,616 --> 00:34:47,914
They study in our college.
- I see

311
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:50,087
"Sir, we have a problem"

312
00:34:50,455 --> 00:34:55,688
The exams start tomorrow
and Nirjara is very upset

313
00:34:56,527 --> 00:34:58,688
Why? Hasn't she been studying?

314
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:02,832
"No, actually...
- She has lost her admission card"

315
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:06,628
I had kept it in my book.
It has gone missing

316
00:35:06,971 --> 00:35:10,168
So?
- A notice on the college board says...

317
00:35:10,508 --> 00:35:13,033
they won't allow us to appear
for the exams without the card

318
00:35:20,318 --> 00:35:22,752
You have come to me
with such a small problem?

319
00:35:23,187 --> 00:35:26,156
Know what? We'll tear out the
notice board and throw it away

320
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:30,188
"When the notice board is thrown away,
you can appear for the exams"

321
00:35:30,394 --> 00:35:33,420
Can't we request the Principal?

322
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:39,425
"Actually, Nirjara...
I don't make requests"

323
00:35:40,438 --> 00:35:43,271
What I say once
is the final call

324
00:35:45,209 --> 00:35:47,143
Piping hot samosas!

325
00:35:50,781 --> 00:35:52,749
Keep it here

326
00:35:53,384 --> 00:35:55,284
Have a diet coke

327
00:35:56,587 --> 00:35:58,282
Here you are

328
00:35:59,524 --> 00:36:01,424
Have some samosas

329
00:36:01,792 --> 00:36:03,089
For you

330
00:36:04,762 --> 00:36:05,888
For you

331
00:36:06,964 --> 00:36:10,161
Have the samosas and coke...
and leave the tension to me

332
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:14,437
For you

333
00:36:17,308 --> 00:36:21,210
"Is there anything else
I can send, Radhe Sir?"

334
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:26,142
No thanks. Everything's here.
I don't need anything

335
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:28,485
Not even you

336
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,480
Catch

337
00:36:32,423 --> 00:36:34,482
The phone won't ring ever

338
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:42,193
People raise a loan to either
buy a house or for education

339
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:45,168
But you write the reason as...

340
00:36:45,603 --> 00:36:48,538
I want to pay the money to my in-laws
and bring my son back

341
00:36:50,241 --> 00:36:53,540
You haven't written anything in
the column meant for sureties?

342
00:36:54,579 --> 00:36:57,013
"If I had something to mortgage,
why would I come here for a loan?"

343
00:36:57,381 --> 00:37:00,475
We need some guarantee that you
will repay the loan

344
00:37:00,851 --> 00:37:03,479
You mean honesty
has no value at all?

345
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:07,088
"In that case, give me your honesty.
I'll create a charge on it, okay?"

346
00:37:07,525 --> 00:37:11,484
Well? Where is your honesty?
- What things are you saying to me?

347
00:37:12,263 --> 00:37:14,493
I don't want any loan from you.
Thank you!

348
00:37:14,699 --> 00:37:16,894
I'll find many
who'll give me a loan

349
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:28,545
My exams went off well.
But I'm a bit scared

350
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:31,044
Don't be scared.
God will take care of everything

351
00:37:35,052 --> 00:37:37,247
How did your exams go?
- Very well

352
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:42,116
"If you want your marks increased,
let me know. I can get it down"

353
00:37:43,828 --> 00:37:45,295
"Oh yes, certainly"

354
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:47,564
Let her talk to me

355
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:50,260
"Well, thank you"

356
00:38:05,916 --> 00:38:09,147
"Well, Radhe...? She was profusely
thanking you. What's up?"

357
00:38:10,588 --> 00:38:14,149
She lost her identity card and sought
my help to appear for the exams

358
00:38:14,825 --> 00:38:17,555
That's very careless of her!
Hey girl...

359
00:38:17,862 --> 00:38:23,095
Forget it. She's a decent girl.
- Decent girl means a lovable girl

360
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:26,065
Which means an innocent girl.
- Which means a good girl

361
00:38:26,771 --> 00:38:29,365
The gentleman appears
to have changed

362
00:38:29,707 --> 00:38:32,608
What do you mean by a good girl?
- She sings well

363
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:36,606
When did she sing for you?
- She was singing hymns in the temple

364
00:38:37,048 --> 00:38:40,017
His grandma and mine
also sing nice hymns...

365
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:42,616
but you never went to
the temple to listen to them

366
00:38:43,054 --> 00:38:45,614
My brother and sister-in-law
dragged me there

367
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:49,348
So she sings nice hymns.
Can't be anything else

368
00:38:50,728 --> 00:38:55,961
Well... what's that called?
Gujia. She makes nice gujias

369
00:38:56,434 --> 00:38:58,629
So you had the Gujias too?
- Yes

370
00:39:00,204 --> 00:39:02,069
Why are you eyes so red?

371
00:39:06,644 --> 00:39:10,341
"I couldn't sleep all night.
- Sleep is lost, peace is lost"

372
00:39:10,581 --> 00:39:14,415
Do you at least feel hungry?
- Radhe bhaiyya's a gone case!

373
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:17,279
He's fallen in love
with her!

374
00:39:21,792 --> 00:39:24,955
Look at his face!
Isn't he blushing!

375
00:39:27,098 --> 00:39:29,066
Don't talk nonsense!

376
00:39:30,668 --> 00:39:34,035
"Aslam, Radhe appears to have
changed nowadays"

377
00:39:34,438 --> 00:39:36,963
"Love is spoiling him rotten,
sister-in-law"

378
00:39:37,775 --> 00:39:41,677
What? Are you speaking the truth?
- Don't you know?

379
00:39:42,246 --> 00:39:44,476
It's the girl who came
to your house the other day

380
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:46,683
The one I brought the samosas
and the diet coke for

381
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:50,684
"Oh yes, I guessed
something was fishy"

382
00:39:51,088 --> 00:39:54,683
"You know the priest, who keeps ringing
the bell without any clothes on?"

383
00:39:54,925 --> 00:39:58,019
She's his daughter.
- Must you talk like that about elders?

384
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:00,697
"Why not? He's going to be
related to you, isn't he?"

385
00:40:02,433 --> 00:40:03,400
Rascal

386
00:40:07,505 --> 00:40:09,700
"Sister-in-law,
give me a thousand rupees"

387
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:10,872
At once

388
00:40:12,777 --> 00:40:14,540
"Here, have a laddoo"

389
00:40:14,845 --> 00:40:17,541
I have a sweet-heart.
I don't need laddoos

390
00:40:17,782 --> 00:40:19,682
"You need them badly,
go ahead and eat it"

391
00:40:19,817 --> 00:40:22,752
Here you are.
- What's this? I need only 1000 rupees

392
00:40:23,053 --> 00:40:26,147
Keep it. You might need it.
- Why a couple of thousands?

393
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:28,751
Stuff five or ten thousand
in his pocket

394
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:32,129
"It isn't from the money you give me.
It's from my savings, keep it"

395
00:40:33,964 --> 00:40:35,056
"Let's go, Aslam"

396
00:40:38,803 --> 00:40:41,169
Why did you have to give that
good-for-nothing anymore money?

397
00:40:41,572 --> 00:40:43,506
Why do you want to
spoil him even more?

398
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:47,767
Wrong! It's time for our Radhe
to turn a new leaf

399
00:40:48,512 --> 00:40:50,605
Really? Did you hear that
in a divine announcement?

400
00:40:50,848 --> 00:40:52,816
He has fallen in love

401
00:40:53,918 --> 00:40:57,149
What? Fallen in love?
- Yes

402
00:40:57,488 --> 00:40:59,149
Radhe's in love?
- Yes

403
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:01,190
I wonder which girl has been
struck by misfortune!

404
00:41:01,325 --> 00:41:04,453
Don't say such inauspicious things.
You didn't ask me who the girl is

405
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:06,763
As if you won't tell unless I ask

406
00:41:07,598 --> 00:41:10,931
It's the one we met at the temple.
She sang in such a sweet voice

407
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:14,498
It's the priest's daughter
who even came to our house

408
00:41:14,905 --> 00:41:19,604
Oh yes...
- She reminds me of my sister...

409
00:41:19,844 --> 00:41:22,142
who's no more.
- There she goes again

410
00:41:22,847 --> 00:41:28,149
"The same features,
the same smile and laughter"

411
00:41:28,786 --> 00:41:30,549
"Hurry up, move it"

412
00:41:30,855 --> 00:41:33,824
Move it!

413
00:41:34,758 --> 00:41:38,819
Hey glasses... aren't you satisfied
topping for three years? Get up

414
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:41,562
This one's old enough to be a mother
and she's still studying

415
00:41:41,866 --> 00:41:43,834
"Watch it, Aslam. She's a lecturer!
- Lecturer?"

416
00:41:44,134 --> 00:41:46,830
"Madam, will you please go out?"

417
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:10,554
Have you eaten?

418
00:42:11,262 --> 00:42:12,559
Yes

419
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:15,427
My friends have been
ribbing me of late

420
00:42:15,933 --> 00:42:23,499
"They say, my love story's all set,
all fixed up. But I told them..."

421
00:42:29,013 --> 00:42:32,972
It's another matter that I've changed
a bit over the last week or two

422
00:42:33,517 --> 00:42:37,681
I'm beginning to feel
a sense of responsibility

423
00:42:38,923 --> 00:42:43,053
I'm thinking of
taking up a nice job

424
00:42:43,994 --> 00:42:48,556
"In a beer bar, you know.
The job of a bouncer or a bodyguard"

425
00:42:48,999 --> 00:42:51,900
I don't get a word
of what you're saying

426
00:42:53,304 --> 00:42:57,297
That's exactly what I love about you.
You don't get anything at all

427
00:42:58,676 --> 00:43:00,371
"All right, I'll explain"

428
00:43:01,845 --> 00:43:06,873
Now look at this and this...
carefully

429
00:43:09,787 --> 00:43:12,688
"What happened?
A clap, right?"

430
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:17,550
It happened when this hand and
this hand came close together

431
00:43:19,997 --> 00:43:22,693
"You're one hand,
I'm the other"

432
00:43:23,133 --> 00:43:25,033
We ought to meet like that

433
00:43:25,202 --> 00:43:27,363
Radhe's using philosophy
to reason with her

434
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:35,568
"You must be wondering whether my folks
will accept you, isn't it?"

435
00:43:36,413 --> 00:43:38,643
"But you needn't worry.
They are very orthodox, no doubt"

436
00:43:39,083 --> 00:43:42,211
"But if I don't eat for a day or two,
everything will be all right"

437
00:43:42,553 --> 00:43:47,752
"If your father creates any trouble,
right under his ear, on the neck..."

438
00:43:49,026 --> 00:43:50,584
I'll give him a tight slap

439
00:43:51,929 --> 00:43:55,296
"Fifteen days after our marriage,
he won't know where he is"

440
00:44:20,057 --> 00:44:23,288
You heard what I said?
That's full and final

441
00:44:24,995 --> 00:44:25,620
Yes

442
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:30,759
That...

443
00:44:34,304 --> 00:44:36,966
O ascetic...

444
00:44:44,848 --> 00:44:50,343
I've fallen in love with you

445
00:44:54,124 --> 00:45:00,029
I've fallen in love

446
00:45:01,665 --> 00:45:04,566
"My eyes yearn
to see your face"

447
00:45:11,341 --> 00:45:15,710
"My eyes yearn to see you,
I shed tears when I miss you..."

448
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:18,048
"on my lips, is your name..."

449
00:45:18,182 --> 00:45:20,275
"in my breath, is your name..."

450
00:45:20,517 --> 00:45:23,008
"my heart...
oh I've lost my heart"

451
00:45:23,187 --> 00:45:29,023
I've fallen in love with you

452
00:46:09,066 --> 00:46:12,365
O hermit...

453
00:46:13,804 --> 00:46:18,366
"Like a lotus blossoming
in moonlight..."

454
00:46:18,842 --> 00:46:22,403
"is your lovely face, my love"

455
00:46:38,328 --> 00:46:42,628
Like a couplet penned in simplicity...

456
00:46:43,133 --> 00:46:46,500
"is your lovely face, my love"

457
00:46:48,539 --> 00:46:52,532
"My eyes yearn to see you,
I shed tears when I miss you..."

458
00:46:53,010 --> 00:46:55,137
"on my lips, is your name..."

459
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:57,743
"in my breath, is your name..."

460
00:46:57,948 --> 00:47:00,246
"my heart...
oh I've lost my heart"

461
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:06,081
I've fallen in love with you

462
00:47:26,910 --> 00:47:30,937
"Appear in my dreams,
live in my heart..."

463
00:47:31,315 --> 00:47:35,547
"show me a glimpse of
your beautiful face, my love"

464
00:47:51,201 --> 00:47:55,501
"Without you, my heart
won't be placated anymore..."

465
00:47:55,772 --> 00:47:59,538
"come to me and
don't go away ever"

466
00:48:00,911 --> 00:48:05,746
"My eyes yearn to see you,
I shed tears when I miss you..."

467
00:48:06,083 --> 00:48:07,948
"on my lips, is your name..."

468
00:48:08,185 --> 00:48:10,153
"in my breath, is your name..."

469
00:48:10,387 --> 00:48:12,821
"my heart...
oh I've lost my heart"

470
00:48:13,090 --> 00:48:19,154
I've fallen in love with you

471
00:48:22,866 --> 00:48:28,361
I've fallen in love

472
00:48:32,976 --> 00:48:35,877
You've come to the
canteen after ages...

473
00:48:36,179 --> 00:48:38,875
and you're smiling to yourself?
What's the matter?

474
00:48:39,249 --> 00:48:41,877
There's surely something
brewing in his heart

475
00:48:42,452 --> 00:48:45,216
Don't hide it from your friends.
Tell us... what's it all about?

476
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:52,021
So you've reached a stage
where you're exchanging gifts!

477
00:48:52,462 --> 00:48:54,225
For your girlfriend?

478
00:48:59,403 --> 00:49:01,803
Radhe... Nirjara

479
00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:16,481
"Chander, what's her brother's name?
- Not brother. It's her fiance"

480
00:49:16,753 --> 00:49:18,220
Rameshwar

481
00:49:20,257 --> 00:49:22,623
But you needn't be worried.
The match isn't finalised yet...

482
00:49:22,759 --> 00:49:24,386
they're only talking about it

483
00:49:35,105 --> 00:49:38,768
"What happened, mister?
- Leave the bike at the stand"

484
00:49:39,176 --> 00:49:43,579
"But what is all this about?
- I'll explain, I'll tell you..."

485
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:45,744
"will you step aside, please?"

486
00:49:46,116 --> 00:49:48,084
"Master, send a cup of
tea for the gentleman?"

487
00:49:48,452 --> 00:49:52,650
"No tea, send a cup of
special coffee for him"

488
00:49:53,323 --> 00:49:55,757
"No, I won't have any tea or coffee"

489
00:49:56,126 --> 00:49:58,094
It's time for my prayers.
I must go home

490
00:49:58,328 --> 00:50:00,296
God is not running away

491
00:50:00,564 --> 00:50:02,794
"He is where he is,
you can sit here"

492
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:04,493
Sit down

493
00:50:05,469 --> 00:50:09,906
"So, do you know him?"

494
00:50:13,377 --> 00:50:15,140
"No, who is he?"

495
00:50:15,379 --> 00:50:19,338
You don't know him?
You don't know your own folks?

496
00:50:20,083 --> 00:50:24,679
"You ought to drown out of shame!
He's related to you, you know"

497
00:50:26,390 --> 00:50:30,156
Related? He isn't...?

498
00:50:31,128 --> 00:50:32,925
"What lineage do you
come from, mister?"

499
00:50:33,196 --> 00:50:38,964
Are you going to pickle the lineage?
Not the village...

500
00:50:39,403 --> 00:50:44,363
he's related to you through Nirjara.
- How?

501
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:49,075
He's your brother-in-law

502
00:50:53,183 --> 00:50:55,083
Brother-in-law

503
00:50:55,452 --> 00:50:56,714
Ponytail

504
00:50:59,489 --> 00:51:01,354
"Go on, your brother-in-law's
calling you"

505
00:51:05,395 --> 00:51:06,362
Yes?

506
00:51:08,398 --> 00:51:11,959
"Look, I'll tell you just once.
Listen carefully"

507
00:51:13,103 --> 00:51:15,867
I have a scene going with her.
- Who?

508
00:51:19,443 --> 00:51:23,971
Nirjara. I've settled it all
with her yesterday

509
00:51:24,448 --> 00:51:26,416
Final. You get that?

510
00:51:27,684 --> 00:51:29,743
"I mustn't see you
with her again, okay?"

511
00:51:30,487 --> 00:51:35,424
"If I see you with her ever again,
I'll set your ponytail on fire..."

512
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:38,985
and you'll fly into the skies
like a rocket

513
00:51:40,464 --> 00:51:41,931
You get that?

514
00:51:43,467 --> 00:51:44,491
Go away

515
00:51:52,209 --> 00:51:53,233
Poor guy

516
00:51:53,677 --> 00:51:56,612
"You've collected very little
money in the bank, Archana?"

517
00:51:57,013 --> 00:52:00,176
They take away all the money
in the brokerage

518
00:52:01,318 --> 00:52:04,151
"But you're getting a loan, aren't you?
- Of course, why not?"

519
00:52:04,521 --> 00:52:06,819
God! This is the limit!

520
00:52:07,190 --> 00:52:09,852
They've started a brothel
right here in the locality

521
00:52:13,463 --> 00:52:15,897
Stop talking and get to work

522
00:52:16,266 --> 00:52:18,427
"You go to number 3,
and you go to number 4"

523
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:23,432
The one who owned the house sold it
and went away to Mumbai

524
00:52:24,207 --> 00:52:26,175
These people are not leaving
the locality anymore

525
00:52:26,576 --> 00:52:28,544
God alone knows what's
going to happen now

526
00:52:32,516 --> 00:52:34,006
Nirjara... one moment

527
00:52:37,521 --> 00:52:39,716
I... at the college yesterday...

528
00:52:41,391 --> 00:52:42,983
"nothing, go on"

529
00:52:44,528 --> 00:52:46,792
Not from here.
Go from there

530
00:53:07,517 --> 00:53:09,485
"I'll sit there, Nirjara.
You sit here"

531
00:53:28,705 --> 00:53:30,536
I've brought a gift for you

532
00:53:31,675 --> 00:53:36,169
"I had bought it yesterday,
but ponytail ruined my mood"

533
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:39,208
It's made to order.
It'll look great in your feet

534
00:53:41,618 --> 00:53:44,212
"No, I don't want it"

535
00:53:44,588 --> 00:53:47,614
Feeling shy?
Why do you have to be shy?

536
00:53:48,191 --> 00:53:49,158
Take it

537
00:53:50,427 --> 00:53:53,396
It isn't how you think it is

538
00:53:53,797 --> 00:53:56,891
"No, it isn't how
you think it is"

539
00:53:57,367 --> 00:53:59,961
It isn't silver.
It's white gold

540
00:54:02,138 --> 00:54:07,542
I don't have at heart
the things you have

541
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:11,540
"But... in the library you said,
you and I..."

542
00:54:12,315 --> 00:54:15,546
People are watching.
Please don't create a farce

543
00:54:16,286 --> 00:54:18,254
I'm the one who's being
subjected to a farce

544
00:54:18,622 --> 00:54:23,355
Everyone in the college laughs at me.
But I don't care for them

545
00:54:24,394 --> 00:54:27,727
We mustn't worry about them
because...

546
00:54:28,164 --> 00:54:32,567
we have a whole life ahead of us.
Take it now

547
00:54:34,704 --> 00:54:35,671
O God!

548
00:54:37,641 --> 00:54:41,805
I swear it on my education.
I haven't any such thing on my mind

549
00:54:50,887 --> 00:54:54,015
Do you think I lack something?

550
00:54:57,294 --> 00:54:59,728
Have I bad habits?
Am I not a nice man?

551
00:55:00,497 --> 00:55:02,863
"Tell me, I'll change everything"

552
00:55:05,368 --> 00:55:07,268
Nirjara... listen to me

553
00:55:12,008 --> 00:55:13,566
Hands off me!

554
00:55:16,146 --> 00:55:18,239
Thug! Rascal!

555
00:55:48,645 --> 00:55:50,476
I knew this was going to happen!

556
00:55:51,514 --> 00:55:54,347
I had told you to say
I love you to her

557
00:55:54,718 --> 00:55:57,016
I even wished you
a happy married life!

558
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:00,751
And you go and tell her
that you'll slap her father

559
00:56:01,124 --> 00:56:03,888
"He'll wake up ten days after the
marriage and wonder where he is"

560
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:06,956
Forget about what has happened
and think of the future

561
00:56:07,397 --> 00:56:09,365
I have an idea.
Know what?

562
00:56:09,666 --> 00:56:14,296
"Woo Indu, Nirjara's best friend.
She'll lure Nirjara for you"

563
00:56:14,704 --> 00:56:18,640
"Shut up! He can't score with one girl,
and you're talking about another!"

564
00:56:19,042 --> 00:56:20,634
I have an idea too

565
00:56:21,444 --> 00:56:26,780
Let's write on the Taj Mahal:
With love from Radhe Mohan to Nirjara

566
00:56:27,217 --> 00:56:29,481
She'll melt the moment
she reads that

567
00:56:30,387 --> 00:56:32,685
Well? Didn't you
like the idea?

568
00:56:33,723 --> 00:56:35,190
"Here, have some grams"

569
00:56:35,792 --> 00:56:38,454
"She called you a thug, didn't she?"

570
00:56:38,828 --> 00:56:42,457
So stop getting into fights
and brawls from today

571
00:56:42,832 --> 00:56:44,800
Turn into a good boy

572
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:48,602
Your work will be done!

573
00:56:59,883 --> 00:57:02,147
You sway because there's
a girl with you?

574
00:57:02,519 --> 00:57:04,680
I said I'm sorry.
- Will that set everything right?

575
00:57:11,728 --> 00:57:13,195
Save him someone!

576
00:58:42,585 --> 00:58:44,553
Well? You aren't ashamed
are you?

577
00:58:45,355 --> 00:58:48,381
"When you get beaten up, you come to
Radhe Mohan with your tail wagging?"

578
00:58:48,658 --> 00:58:51,821
"In trouble, some people invoke God
and some invoke the devil!"

579
00:58:52,595 --> 00:58:55,155
And there you were...
crying Radhe! Radhe!

580
00:58:55,598 --> 00:58:58,499
"Because we're your friends, must we
get just about anywhere for you..."

581
00:58:58,868 --> 00:59:05,205
and do anything for you?
But if you wear a salwar kameez...

582
00:59:05,608 --> 00:59:09,977
"and come to us with Gujia,
we'll even lick your feet"

583
00:59:10,713 --> 00:59:14,809
Aslam... skip the nonsense

584
00:59:15,852 --> 00:59:21,381
"You hear that? You do?
Go away, get lost"

585
00:59:21,858 --> 00:59:25,419
There's no friend here.
There's only a jilted lover...

586
00:59:25,962 --> 00:59:28,396
who has gone mad for his Juliet

587
00:59:28,865 --> 00:59:32,596
A Juliet who doesn't
care two hoots for him

588
00:59:32,936 --> 00:59:37,896
"Very soon, that Juliet will marry
someone else and cock a snook at him"

589
00:59:41,144 --> 00:59:42,634
Why're you talking to them?
Talk to me

590
00:59:42,912 --> 00:59:46,439
What will I say to you? What?
Are you worth talking to at all?

591
00:59:46,816 --> 00:59:49,546
You want to hit me...?
- Don't show off your body

592
00:59:49,919 --> 00:59:50,886
Hit me!

593
00:59:56,125 --> 00:59:57,558
You hit me...?

594
01:00:00,530 --> 01:00:02,395
"She's marrying someone else,
you say?"

595
01:00:03,967 --> 01:00:08,233
She'll marry and go away!
You think I can live without her?

596
01:00:08,972 --> 01:00:11,668
Tell me! Will I be able
to live without her?

597
01:00:14,143 --> 01:00:17,078
You're my friend
and you curse me!

598
01:00:21,985 --> 01:00:22,952
Lay off!

599
01:00:28,091 --> 01:00:34,462
Hit me! Nirjara's not around!
So why you have stopped?

600
01:00:47,910 --> 01:00:49,309
"For you, sir"

601
01:00:56,653 --> 01:00:58,280
"Chander, my sorry"

602
01:01:09,666 --> 01:01:11,031
"I'm sorry, buddy"

603
01:01:11,534 --> 01:01:13,502
You were the one who told me
to give up fights and brawls...

604
01:01:13,770 --> 01:01:15,533
and become a good boy

605
01:01:17,473 --> 01:01:19,134
I made a mistake

606
01:01:20,576 --> 01:01:23,067
Listen... at least look at me

607
01:01:25,581 --> 01:01:26,548
What is it?

608
01:01:37,527 --> 01:01:41,088
You've softened so soon.
I wish you were Nirjara

609
01:01:41,564 --> 01:01:44,590
Not Nirjara again!
Why don't you forget her?

610
01:01:47,837 --> 01:01:49,327
What can I do?

611
01:01:51,874 --> 01:01:55,310
"I do my best to forget her,
but I can't"

612
01:01:56,446 --> 01:01:57,970
I feel as if...

613
01:02:00,817 --> 01:02:02,944
I've bequeathed
my life in her name

614
01:02:35,918 --> 01:02:38,352
In your name...

615
01:02:41,357 --> 01:02:43,848
in your name...

616
01:02:46,896 --> 01:02:52,857
"in your name,
I have bequeathed my entire life"

617
01:02:58,875 --> 01:03:02,538
"My entire life, my love"

618
01:03:04,514 --> 01:03:09,850
I love you so dearly...

619
01:03:10,686 --> 01:03:14,554
"you are my romance, my love"

620
01:03:58,768 --> 01:04:03,865
"What state has love
brought you to?"

621
01:04:04,407 --> 01:04:08,707
"Even rose-gardens appear to be
the wastelands to me..."

622
01:04:09,946 --> 01:04:13,882
"my loved ones appear to be
strangers to me"

623
01:04:15,484 --> 01:04:19,921
"I'm forever lost
in your memories..."

624
01:04:20,756 --> 01:04:24,715
people call me mad and crazy

625
01:04:26,762 --> 01:04:31,495
Without you...

626
01:04:31,968 --> 01:04:37,929
"without you, life is impossible
to spend, my love"

627
01:05:11,807 --> 01:05:15,937
"Love, I can't be rid of..."

628
01:05:19,815 --> 01:05:23,979
"the bond of love
cannot be broken"

629
01:05:25,254 --> 01:05:28,781
"In the tears
that flow from my eyes..."

630
01:05:30,826 --> 01:05:34,990
"I saw you even among
the Moon and the stars"

631
01:05:36,265 --> 01:05:39,792
"I have burnt in the
fires of separation..."

632
01:05:41,837 --> 01:05:45,000
"yours is the name
my heart chants every moment"

633
01:05:47,643 --> 01:05:52,046
"For you, only for you..."

634
01:05:52,882 --> 01:06:00,220
"for you, I shall bear
every tyranny in the world, my love"

635
01:06:10,232 --> 01:06:18,003
"In your name,
I have bequeathed my entire life"

636
01:06:22,078 --> 01:06:26,378
"My entire life, my love"

637
01:06:42,098 --> 01:06:45,397
In your name...

638
01:06:50,106 --> 01:06:51,869
"I find it very tough, Lord"

639
01:06:53,442 --> 01:06:55,376
I can't even breathe
properly nowadays

640
01:06:57,313 --> 01:06:59,713
Please do me a favour

641
01:07:05,087 --> 01:07:09,854
Give me the strength
to forget her

642
01:07:23,005 --> 01:07:25,064
I'm not sparing you guys!

643
01:07:26,075 --> 01:07:28,908
You hide the good-looking one
and give me the old hag!

644
01:07:29,278 --> 01:07:31,109
You think I'm drunk?

645
01:07:33,149 --> 01:07:35,777
Let me go! Let go of my hand!
- This one's pretty! Oh yes!

646
01:07:36,152 --> 01:07:37,642
Where are you going?
- Help!

647
01:07:37,953 --> 01:07:39,443
Leave her alone!

648
01:07:41,157 --> 01:07:42,590
Who are you?

649
01:07:43,559 --> 01:07:45,220
Who the hell are you?

650
01:07:46,929 --> 01:07:51,127
Wait here! What filth are you
spreading by starting a brothel here!

651
01:07:52,068 --> 01:07:54,798
"Radhe, that chap was teasing
a girl near the brothel"

652
01:07:55,171 --> 01:07:56,638
He hit me!

653
01:08:00,810 --> 01:08:02,107
Go on

654
01:08:08,150 --> 01:08:09,583
"No, not him"

655
01:08:13,255 --> 01:08:14,654
What is it?

656
01:08:34,210 --> 01:08:35,142
Hello

657
01:08:36,412 --> 01:08:37,470
Listen

658
01:08:39,915 --> 01:08:42,509
I've been waiting for a long time.
Have you brought my money?

659
01:08:44,286 --> 01:08:47,653
"That man who brought me here said
I'd be given 200,000 rupees"

660
01:08:48,090 --> 01:08:51,184
"When you go to your in-laws,
you'll get the money there"

661
01:08:51,494 --> 01:08:53,519
Spread out in all the directions

662
01:08:54,296 --> 01:08:57,493
It's my in-laws I've got
to pay the money to

663
01:08:57,933 --> 01:08:59,992
Please ask them to hurry.
I've got to go home

664
01:09:00,302 --> 01:09:03,465
Please give me my money.
- You seem to come from a nice family

665
01:09:04,206 --> 01:09:07,869
But you're a whore.
You ought to be ashamed

666
01:09:12,414 --> 01:09:13,881
What did you say?

667
01:09:14,283 --> 01:09:17,047
You talk rubbish with me...?
I'll slit your tongue!

668
01:09:18,020 --> 01:09:20,181
You're not doing me a favour
by giving me the money!

669
01:09:20,556 --> 01:09:23,218
You're going to collect interest!
But I don't want your money anymore!

670
01:09:23,592 --> 01:09:25,355
I'm going home!
- Wait

671
01:09:26,395 --> 01:09:27,987
You're not going home

672
01:09:28,364 --> 01:09:31,197
"If you step out of this place,
you'll go to the cop-house"

673
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:33,730
What do you mean?
- Look

674
01:09:35,938 --> 01:09:38,338
This is a brothel
the police have raided

675
01:09:40,276 --> 01:09:43,370
God! Where have I landed?

676
01:09:45,347 --> 01:09:47,247
Throw them in the jeep!

677
01:10:10,439 --> 01:10:11,428
Sit down

678
01:10:39,301 --> 01:10:43,863
I raised my hand at you.
Please forgive me

679
01:10:45,407 --> 01:10:48,137
What's your husband's name?
Where does he work?

680
01:10:49,211 --> 01:10:52,874
His name is Atmaram. He works
at the Public Works Department

681
01:11:11,133 --> 01:11:13,101
"I'm asking for the file,
can't you see?"

682
01:11:13,469 --> 01:11:16,336
It's right there.
Go and get it

683
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:20,374
Well? What is it?

684
01:11:22,311 --> 01:11:23,835
Who are you?

685
01:11:24,213 --> 01:11:25,805
What are you doing?

686
01:11:27,316 --> 01:11:28,977
Listen to me...

687
01:11:29,418 --> 01:11:33,047
What the hell are you doing?
Why won't you listen to me?

688
01:11:33,856 --> 01:11:34,823
Sharmaji...

689
01:11:37,426 --> 01:11:38,484
My glasses?

690
01:11:39,428 --> 01:11:41,521
Why're you slapping me?

691
01:11:42,131 --> 01:11:44,099
"If you raise your hand,
I'll give you a thrashing"

692
01:11:44,433 --> 01:11:46,560
Enough! Stop it...

693
01:11:47,469 --> 01:11:49,437
What mistake have I made?
Why're you hitting me?

694
01:11:49,772 --> 01:11:52,240
My hands did the talking.
Now I'll explain

695
01:11:54,977 --> 01:11:56,945
Go and bring your wife back
tomorrow morning

696
01:11:59,181 --> 01:12:04,141
"Else, you'll get four slaps at
breakfast and eight at dinner. Okay?"

697
01:12:11,193 --> 01:12:14,390
"If you don't treat her well,
I'll have to visit you again"

698
01:12:19,134 --> 01:12:21,932
Ponytail... what are
you doing here?

699
01:12:23,138 --> 01:12:28,075
"Do you know that man, Radhe-ji?
- No, but that makes no difference"

700
01:12:43,559 --> 01:12:44,685
Brother-in-law...?

701
01:12:50,265 --> 01:12:52,460
"Sister, your husband is here
with Rahul"

702
01:13:01,276 --> 01:13:02,937
What happened to you?

703
01:13:04,179 --> 01:13:06,010
Nothing... it's just...

704
01:13:06,415 --> 01:13:09,851
Mummy...
- Rahul! My son!

705
01:13:13,422 --> 01:13:15,982
"Mamta, pack your bags.
I'm here to take you back"

706
01:13:20,162 --> 01:13:22,790
But the money hasn't been...
- I don't want any money

707
01:13:23,232 --> 01:13:25,666
Forget all that and
just come with me

708
01:13:33,308 --> 01:13:36,471
"Nirjara, listen to me for a minute.
- I have nothing to discuss with you"

709
01:13:36,879 --> 01:13:40,679
What you think about me is not true...
- Why are you bothering me?

710
01:13:41,183 --> 01:13:43,174
"I don't want to listen to anything.
Not a minute, not five..."

711
01:13:43,552 --> 01:13:45,918
"not today, not tomorrow, not ever!
You hear that?"

712
01:13:46,288 --> 01:13:47,846
And don't you dare follow me!

713
01:13:48,090 --> 01:13:51,287
You tease girls in the temple?
What is your name?

714
01:13:51,660 --> 01:13:54,527
Where do you live?
Tell us your name!

715
01:13:56,265 --> 01:13:58,028
The name is Radhe.
- Forgive me

716
01:13:58,367 --> 01:14:00,460
"She went in that direction,
you'll go in the other"

717
01:14:23,992 --> 01:14:26,017
You offered the oil?
- Yes

718
01:14:26,428 --> 01:14:29,864
It's thanks to Him that my sister
has settled down gain

719
01:14:30,232 --> 01:14:33,531
"No, Nirjara. Mamta has settled
down again not because of Him..."

720
01:14:34,570 --> 01:14:37,061
she has settled down
thanks to Radhe

721
01:14:40,242 --> 01:14:43,336
Your sister had landed in a brothel
in trying to raise a loan

722
01:14:44,313 --> 01:14:46,247
Had Radhe not got there
at the nick of the time...

723
01:14:47,683 --> 01:14:49,913
I don't know what calamity
would have struck her

724
01:14:51,553 --> 01:14:54,181
Mamta herself told me about it

725
01:14:57,626 --> 01:15:00,322
He's the one who brought your
brother-in-law to his senses

726
01:15:00,696 --> 01:15:03,324
Which is why he quietly came and
took Mamta back to his house

727
01:15:04,867 --> 01:15:08,234
Radhe didn't even know
that Mamta is your sister

728
01:15:09,571 --> 01:15:13,200
"Just think. When a man,
without any self-interest..."

729
01:15:13,609 --> 01:15:17,375
"helps save another person's family,
is he a bad human being?"

730
01:15:19,081 --> 01:15:21,914
"Yes, I admit he's a bit
hard and wayward"

731
01:15:22,751 --> 01:15:26,380
"For that matter,
even God lives in idols of stone"

732
01:15:27,523 --> 01:15:29,514
But don't we worship Him?

733
01:15:31,426 --> 01:15:35,089
The truth is that
he loves you very much

734
01:15:37,099 --> 01:15:38,259
True love

735
01:15:39,735 --> 01:15:44,104
Think about it.
Did he ever misbehave with you?

736
01:15:44,673 --> 01:15:46,766
Did he ever try to
take advantage of you?

737
01:15:47,476 --> 01:15:49,410
He hasn't even touched you

738
01:15:51,179 --> 01:15:54,774
You must be wondering why
I'm telling you all this

739
01:15:56,685 --> 01:16:01,987
It's because I've realised...
he's a far better human being than me

740
01:16:02,758 --> 01:16:07,752
"Better than you, better than me,
better than thousands of others"

741
01:16:10,165 --> 01:16:12,599
He can even lay down
his life for you

742
01:16:14,636 --> 01:16:19,938
Which is why Radhe Mohan is
your true companion for life

743
01:16:22,444 --> 01:16:23,604
Not me

744
01:18:04,212 --> 01:18:07,511
Take a look at me!
Have you ever seen me like this?

745
01:18:08,917 --> 01:18:13,320
I used to be so happy! But ever
since I've fallen in love with you...

746
01:18:13,755 --> 01:18:15,723
it seems as if my bad times have begun

747
01:18:17,626 --> 01:18:23,292
"I thought people who gave up their
lives for their love, were such fools"

748
01:18:23,899 --> 01:18:26,060
"But now I realise,
why they do it"

749
01:18:26,635 --> 01:18:29,126
"Rather than suffer like me,
they get their freedom in moments!"

750
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:34,409
But you needn't worry.
I'm not dying

751
01:18:34,910 --> 01:18:38,573
"Because, if I die...
you will become a widow"

752
01:18:40,816 --> 01:18:42,784
And I can't bear to see
you being widowed

753
01:18:44,619 --> 01:18:46,280
The truth is...

754
01:19:21,056 --> 01:19:24,355
Enough! Enough!

755
01:19:26,027 --> 01:19:27,585
I feel like...

756
01:19:55,824 --> 01:20:00,659
"Now look, Nirjara...
I don't want to rape you"

757
01:20:02,697 --> 01:20:05,165
I only want two minutes from you

758
01:20:06,635 --> 01:20:09,536
I want you to hear how I feel.
That's it

759
01:20:10,705 --> 01:20:14,197
I want you to be happy.
And smiling

760
01:20:16,111 --> 01:20:17,908
You get what I'm saying?

761
01:20:23,952 --> 01:20:25,920
Everyone in the world
falls in love

762
01:20:26,955 --> 01:20:30,982
Am I the only one without a right
to love someone...

763
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:33,528
to have someone love me?
Well?

764
01:20:35,764 --> 01:20:37,732
We'll treat you like a queen

765
01:20:38,967 --> 01:20:45,202
"I, my brother, my sister-in-law,
Binti... and all my friends..."

766
01:20:48,577 --> 01:20:50,977
That boy your father
has chosen for you...

767
01:20:55,016 --> 01:20:59,476
I'm not saying he's not a good guy.
He must be a nice chap

768
01:21:00,989 --> 01:21:05,085
Start calling him your brother.
Or make a friend out of him

769
01:21:06,895 --> 01:21:08,726
I'll accept your friend

770
01:21:10,665 --> 01:21:12,929
I want to give the priest's
daughter a nice life...

771
01:21:14,536 --> 01:21:17,130
and that priest wants to
snatch my life from me?

772
01:21:18,740 --> 01:21:21,231
"As if he's the priest,
and I'm an untouchable!"

773
01:21:25,747 --> 01:21:27,772
What future will
you have with him?

774
01:21:28,516 --> 01:21:32,976
"When I think of it,
about you and him..."

775
01:21:34,022 --> 01:21:35,990
it sends my head reeling.
Like this!

776
01:21:39,027 --> 01:21:44,192
"After listening to all this,
you must surely realise..."

777
01:21:45,033 --> 01:21:49,163
"how dearly I love you?
If you still don't get it, I..."

778
01:21:50,805 --> 01:21:52,500
I know what I'll do!

779
01:22:01,783 --> 01:22:03,978
Go away! Go away!

780
01:22:08,924 --> 01:22:13,987
"Go away, else I'll kill you.
Go!"

781
01:22:16,031 --> 01:22:18,261
But what will I do with my life then?

782
01:22:19,901 --> 01:22:22,301
I don't want to live
a moment without you

783
01:22:25,240 --> 01:22:27,333
Yes! I have forcibly
brought you here!

784
01:22:28,743 --> 01:22:31,576
"And yes, I'm indeed
screaming at you!"

785
01:22:34,082 --> 01:22:35,606
I'm threatening you!

786
01:22:37,252 --> 01:22:39,049
That's only because...

787
01:22:43,091 --> 01:22:45,389
it's because I love you very much

788
01:22:45,827 --> 01:22:51,732
Because I think you were made
only for me... only for me

789
01:22:54,102 --> 01:22:56,070
You were born for me alone

790
01:22:57,105 --> 01:23:00,472
Ask your God! Ask Him!

791
01:23:03,078 --> 01:23:10,041
"I'm going through so much of pain...
so much of misery, God!"

792
01:23:30,105 --> 01:23:31,402
Forgive me

793
01:23:34,142 --> 01:23:35,666
Do please forgive me

794
01:24:04,105 --> 01:24:09,065
"I've draped the scarf...
I dance for you"

795
01:24:20,755 --> 01:24:23,690
"I drape the scarf
and dance..."

796
01:24:24,059 --> 01:24:26,459
for I have lost my heart

797
01:24:29,030 --> 01:24:35,128
"I've fallen in love with you,
I've lost my heart to you"

798
01:24:49,517 --> 01:24:55,649
"Your love gives me a high...
I've lost my heart to you"

799
01:24:57,792 --> 01:25:03,822
"I've fallen in love with you,
I've lost my heart to you"

800
01:25:05,567 --> 01:25:09,128
"I dance, I break every promise..."

801
01:25:09,737 --> 01:25:15,175
"Every promise, I break
and dance today..."

802
01:25:51,312 --> 01:25:55,009
"My bangles speak,
my anklets say..."

803
01:25:55,450 --> 01:25:59,045
"come with the bridal palanquin
and take me away, my love"

804
01:25:59,721 --> 01:26:02,986
With henna on my palms...

805
01:26:03,825 --> 01:26:06,988
"bridal vermillion
on my forehead..."

806
01:26:07,462 --> 01:26:12,866
"I'll dress up
only for you, my love"

807
01:26:13,368 --> 01:26:20,001
"The Spring of my beauty is here...
for I have lost my heart to you"

808
01:26:21,476 --> 01:26:28,245
"I drape the scarf today
and dance for you"

809
01:27:11,559 --> 01:27:14,995
"In your name
I shall bequeath..."

810
01:27:15,730 --> 01:27:18,597
this story of my realisation

811
01:27:19,734 --> 01:27:23,329
"If we are to unite,
we shall unite..."

812
01:27:23,771 --> 01:27:27,070
not to be separated for ages

813
01:27:27,508 --> 01:27:32,070
"I have waited for years, my love"

814
01:27:33,681 --> 01:27:36,707
"Even in pining
I found succour, my love"

815
01:27:37,085 --> 01:27:40,111
I've lost my heart to you

816
01:27:41,389 --> 01:27:48,022
"I've fallen in love with you,
my heart is no longer mine"

817
01:27:49,797 --> 01:27:53,631
"Every promise, I break
and dance today..."

818
01:28:51,459 --> 01:28:54,053
So you're going to make us
shut down our business?

819
01:28:54,429 --> 01:28:57,398
You ought to have kept
your bullying ways to your college

820
01:29:26,127 --> 01:29:27,856
Get up

821
01:29:28,930 --> 01:29:31,398
"You will shut our business down, eh?
Wanna be a hero, eh?"

822
01:33:12,553 --> 01:33:15,920
"Nirjara, how can you
go on like this?"

823
01:33:20,595 --> 01:33:22,187
I want to meet him once

824
01:33:22,563 --> 01:33:23,655
What for?

825
01:33:25,833 --> 01:33:28,427
Why're you unnecessarily
bothering yourself?

826
01:33:31,472 --> 01:33:34,134
"You don't understand, Indu.
- I understand everything"

827
01:33:35,743 --> 01:33:38,906
But is there any point
in all this anymore?

828
01:33:39,780 --> 01:33:45,047
The sooner you get
him out of your mind the better

829
01:33:46,487 --> 01:33:49,923
You understand?
Let's go now. C'mon

830
01:34:18,219 --> 01:34:19,948
Get an injection! Quick!

831
01:35:00,561 --> 01:35:02,188
Where has he gone?

832
01:35:42,603 --> 01:35:44,264
He has survived

833
01:35:44,839 --> 01:35:49,299
But neither can he understand anything
nor recognise anyone

834
01:35:52,980 --> 01:35:55,847
It's really very sad but
every effort of ours...

835
01:35:56,217 --> 01:35:59,084
"to bring about an improvement in
Radhe's condition, has failed"

836
01:36:00,688 --> 01:36:02,986
That's exactly why I wish
to say something to you folks

837
01:36:04,592 --> 01:36:05,581
Of course. Please go ahead

838
01:36:05,993 --> 01:36:10,020
"Although I'm a doctor,
I still believe in God"

839
01:36:11,766 --> 01:36:14,200
Whenever I fall sick...

840
01:36:14,568 --> 01:36:18,129
my mother gives me oblations
before any other medicines

841
01:36:19,874 --> 01:36:22,809
"It has to do with devotion,
it defies logic"

842
01:36:23,677 --> 01:36:28,842
Because prayers and medicines are
both very important in our society

843
01:36:29,683 --> 01:36:30,650
Absolutely

844
01:36:31,185 --> 01:36:33,153
I was going to suggest
something of the sort

845
01:36:34,822 --> 01:36:37,188
You must've heard of Sripurdham?

846
01:36:39,794 --> 01:36:42,422
Although medical science
does not believe in it...

847
01:36:42,797 --> 01:36:48,201
Swami Sheelbhadra uses ancient
cures to heal patients

848
01:36:48,669 --> 01:36:51,263
"If medical science does not believe
it, why must you believe it?"

849
01:36:51,939 --> 01:36:57,377
Do you know? Patients are bound in
chains and treated worse than animals

850
01:36:57,945 --> 01:37:00,539
And you want to send Radhe there?
- That's because...

851
01:37:00,881 --> 01:37:05,716
"in a fit of violence, they shouldn't
hurt themselves or anyone else"

852
01:37:11,458 --> 01:37:16,191
Whatever this boy just said
is not wrong

853
01:37:17,898 --> 01:37:22,733
But it's also true that several patients
like Radhe have been cured there

854
01:37:24,605 --> 01:37:26,664
It has to do with faith
and devotion

855
01:37:28,876 --> 01:37:31,868
"You either have it,
or you don't"

856
01:37:35,950 --> 01:37:38,418
Where is Sripurdham?

857
01:37:38,953 --> 01:37:40,716
Just telephone them

858
01:37:41,055 --> 01:37:44,252
Their workers will come
and personally take Radhe away

859
01:37:49,663 --> 01:37:51,460
What are you thinking of doing?

860
01:37:52,566 --> 01:37:55,501
"What can we think of, Aslam?
We'll have to send him there"

861
01:37:55,970 --> 01:37:58,632
You take just about anyone's
advise seriously!

862
01:37:59,707 --> 01:38:03,473
He spoke in our own interests.
- Really? And what was that?

863
01:38:05,946 --> 01:38:08,244
To not take your brother back home?

864
01:38:09,850 --> 01:38:11,909
To hand him over to some
crazy ascetic?

865
01:38:12,853 --> 01:38:14,912
So that he can try his
mumbo-jumbo on him...?

866
01:38:15,723 --> 01:38:18,157
Even if it leaves your brother dead?
- Aslam!

867
01:38:19,526 --> 01:38:20,925
The doctor's trying
to save his neck...

868
01:38:21,295 --> 01:38:23,320
and these folks don't want anyone
to be a burden on them

869
01:38:24,231 --> 01:38:27,359
"If your brother is such a burden,
don't take him home!"

870
01:38:27,968 --> 01:38:31,927
"I'll take him away. I'll look
after him, I'll nurse him!"

871
01:38:33,007 --> 01:38:35,532
But I'm not letting you send
him to some ascetic's ashram!

872
01:38:36,010 --> 01:38:38,478
Let me tell you that.
And you better listen to me!

873
01:38:38,913 --> 01:38:39,937
Insolent!

874
01:38:41,782 --> 01:38:46,583
I'm the one who has pampered
these boys. It's my fault!

875
01:38:47,755 --> 01:38:50,781
"Else, could anyone
misbehave with you...?"

876
01:38:52,826 --> 01:38:54,657
"Gayatri, calm down"

877
01:38:56,030 --> 01:39:00,694
He's upset because he
loves Radhe so much

878
01:39:03,871 --> 01:39:05,361
Go and sit there

879
01:39:12,079 --> 01:39:16,539
Let him go.
Maybe it's good for Radhe

880
01:39:20,020 --> 01:39:21,487
"Look at me, Aslam"

881
01:39:22,790 --> 01:39:27,318
I can't say whether
I have understood Radhe

882
01:39:29,163 --> 01:39:34,533
But one thing I'm proud of...
he has friends like you

883
01:39:39,406 --> 01:39:41,135
"Forgive me, brother"

884
01:39:46,280 --> 01:39:49,044
You know why I'm sending you
to Sripurdham?

885
01:39:49,850 --> 01:39:52,318
Because I'm fed up of you!
That's it!

886
01:39:53,821 --> 01:39:57,222
I'm sick of your
fights and brawls

887
01:39:58,959 --> 01:40:00,722
I'm tired of reasoning with you!

888
01:40:01,695 --> 01:40:04,858
I now want you to get out
of my sight...

889
01:40:05,265 --> 01:40:09,395
so I can breathe easily!
Do you hear that?

890
01:40:11,038 --> 01:40:13,370
What are you doing?

891
01:40:20,147 --> 01:40:24,777
Look... I've been scolding him.
And he doesn't even talk back

892
01:40:28,756 --> 01:40:34,786
Radhe... I'll sit with you
at the station henceforth

893
01:40:35,162 --> 01:40:38,529
We'll sit outside the college.
We'll act like bullies...

894
01:40:39,166 --> 01:40:40,793
I'll join you too

895
01:40:41,935 --> 01:40:47,134
Just get well...
please get well

896
01:40:57,217 --> 01:40:59,981
"Get well, please"

897
01:41:04,191 --> 01:41:05,453
Sister-in-law...

898
01:41:09,163 --> 01:41:11,461
the van has arrived
to take Radhe away

899
01:42:57,304 --> 01:43:05,211
Why does this happen in love?

900
01:43:57,064 --> 01:44:01,558
Why does loyalty...

901
01:44:02,069 --> 01:44:05,266
not beget loyalty?

902
01:44:06,073 --> 01:44:10,908
Why are good wishes...

903
01:44:11,345 --> 01:44:14,508
not answered with good wishes?

904
01:44:15,349 --> 01:44:19,979
Why is happiness...

905
01:44:20,387 --> 01:44:23,652
not reciprocated with joy?

906
01:44:24,858 --> 01:44:29,818
What does this happen in love?

907
01:45:00,627 --> 01:45:02,822
Love makes you weep...

908
01:45:03,297 --> 01:45:05,527
it makes you forget the world

909
01:45:05,932 --> 01:45:11,336
"It makes you pine,
it makes you restless"

910
01:45:11,938 --> 01:45:15,897
What has love turned people into?

911
01:45:17,411 --> 01:45:19,345
They met their beloveds...

912
01:45:20,080 --> 01:45:22,014
and separated

913
01:45:22,516 --> 01:45:27,180
"All they got was misery
even in Spring..."

914
01:45:27,688 --> 01:45:32,648
"their lifetimes being spent,
waiting for their beloveds"

915
01:45:37,164 --> 01:45:45,401
"Why doesn't a smile
beget a smile?"

916
01:45:46,273 --> 01:45:54,772
"Why isn't loyalty
greeted with loyalty?"

917
01:46:37,991 --> 01:46:41,859
"Time never comes
to a standstill"

918
01:46:43,230 --> 01:46:47,166
Do memories ever cease?

919
01:46:48,368 --> 01:46:52,771
When medicines cease to heal...

920
01:46:53,540 --> 01:46:57,977
what does one do?

921
01:47:02,783 --> 01:47:10,451
"Why isn't joy
greeted with joy?"

922
01:47:12,225 --> 01:47:20,132
"Why isn't loyalty
paid back with loyalty?"

923
01:47:41,354 --> 01:47:42,514
Chander...

924
01:47:44,724 --> 01:47:49,684
no one's telling me how Radhe is.
Where have they taken him?

925
01:47:50,564 --> 01:47:52,327
But you surely know?

926
01:47:53,333 --> 01:47:55,858
Girls are not allowed there

927
01:47:56,570 --> 01:48:00,131
But Radhe will be all right
Don't worry

928
01:48:00,540 --> 01:48:03,737
I've put in a word to God
and He too has told me...

929
01:48:04,177 --> 01:48:05,769
that Radhe will be all right

930
01:48:07,547 --> 01:48:09,481
Praise the Lord...

931
01:49:07,374 --> 01:49:11,538
"See how ardently she
is praying, Rameshwar"

932
01:49:15,615 --> 01:49:17,276
I wonder who's ill

933
01:49:17,617 --> 01:49:20,916
Has she had something to eat?
- No

934
01:49:21,788 --> 01:49:24,916
She's been praying since this morning.
- This morning?

935
01:49:25,525 --> 01:49:29,393
"Yes, a boy in her college is...
- Is...?"

936
01:49:31,431 --> 01:49:34,730
He's lying in the ashram
at Sripur

937
01:49:41,675 --> 01:49:43,768
This girl is just like her mother

938
01:49:44,678 --> 01:49:48,307
She's been fasting and
praying for a stranger

939
01:49:48,682 --> 01:49:51,810
"He's no stranger, Guruji.
- No...?"

940
01:49:58,725 --> 01:50:03,185
That boy belongs to Nirjara's college
and Nirjara...

941
01:50:03,630 --> 01:50:07,964
Yes? Go on.
- She's in love with him

942
01:50:43,503 --> 01:50:48,941
"Nirjara, is what
Rameshwar saying... true?"

943
01:50:54,981 --> 01:50:56,107
"Yes, father"

944
01:50:58,685 --> 01:51:00,118
Lord!

945
01:51:02,422 --> 01:51:07,291
"I've committed no sin, father.
I've done nothing wrong"

946
01:51:07,761 --> 01:51:10,025
What is this if not wrong?

947
01:51:11,765 --> 01:51:14,063
Maybe that boy has
done us favours

948
01:51:15,435 --> 01:51:18,063
He has helped your sister
settle down again

949
01:51:18,638 --> 01:51:21,300
But will you entrust
yourself to him for that?

950
01:51:21,808 --> 01:51:23,742
"I already have, father"

951
01:51:26,046 --> 01:51:28,071
I've given him my heart

952
01:51:31,518 --> 01:51:33,782
And my heart isn't
outside my body

953
01:54:37,871 --> 01:54:40,840
How can you afford
to be so disheartened?

954
01:54:42,008 --> 01:54:47,537
I wasn't ever polite with him

955
01:54:51,017 --> 01:54:52,541
Don't worry

956
01:54:54,020 --> 01:54:57,581
He... he'll return soon

957
01:54:58,925 --> 01:55:01,917
Our Radhe will return.
Just you see

958
01:55:39,899 --> 01:55:40,991
Swamiji...

959
01:56:03,790 --> 01:56:04,779
Swamiji...!

960
01:56:10,029 --> 01:56:11,326
Rameshwarji...

961
01:56:17,036 --> 01:56:18,003
Rameshwarji...

962
01:56:19,038 --> 01:56:20,335
Who is it?

963
01:56:30,249 --> 01:56:35,209
Rameshwarji... please take me
to Radhe. Just once

964
01:56:40,093 --> 01:56:42,618
I'll remain indebted to you
all my life

965
01:56:48,968 --> 01:56:51,402
"All right, we'll leave
in the morning"

966
02:01:35,354 --> 02:01:39,188
Mahantji... Nirjara has gone to
Sripurdham with Rameshwar

967
02:01:39,592 --> 02:01:42,220
A boy from his college
has been admitted there

968
02:01:42,595 --> 02:01:44,722
She said she would
return by nightfall

969
02:01:45,298 --> 02:01:47,061
Here are the keys to your house

970
02:01:48,134 --> 02:01:52,070
The priest is here to meet you.
- Priest?

971
02:01:52,438 --> 02:01:54,633
"Yes, Nirjara's father"

972
02:02:27,506 --> 02:02:29,440
"You've seen what state
he's in, haven't you?"

973
02:02:32,278 --> 02:02:35,441
Do you think we didn't want to
have a daughter-in-law like you?

974
02:02:37,550 --> 02:02:42,453
But perhaps that is
not possible anymore

975
02:02:45,358 --> 02:02:47,121
Had my brother been all right...

976
02:02:47,493 --> 02:02:50,792
I'd have begged your father
for your hand

977
02:02:52,431 --> 02:02:58,995
But to think of him now
and to hope that he...

978
02:03:05,277 --> 02:03:11,512
it's futile. It's over
It's all over

979
02:03:18,758 --> 02:03:22,956
The things man thinks of doing...
and what turns out to be

980
02:03:29,235 --> 02:03:36,664
It isn't right to think only of your
happiness and cause anguish to others

981
02:03:38,677 --> 02:03:45,583
"You know, your father has thought
of nothing but your welfare"

982
02:03:48,354 --> 02:03:50,322
He's the father who has
given you life

983
02:03:52,558 --> 02:03:55,049
You mustn't be obstinate
and drive him to death

984
02:03:59,365 --> 02:04:01,128
"Give him his due, please"

985
02:04:28,294 --> 02:04:30,854
"When is it auspicious to
hold the wedding, holy sir?"

986
02:04:31,263 --> 02:04:38,533
"Friday, July 10 is an
auspicious date for the wedding"

987
02:04:46,612 --> 02:04:50,912
It's all over. Looks like Nirjara
is going to be married to Rameshwar

988
02:04:51,750 --> 02:04:56,380
Why're you hitting him?
- He always talks nonsense!

989
02:04:57,389 --> 02:04:59,880
Radhe's not yet dead.
He's just ill

990
02:05:02,328 --> 02:05:05,229
Wait and see. He'll come back
as soon as he gets well

991
02:05:05,598 --> 02:05:08,260
And when will that be? When?
After the marriage is over?

992
02:05:08,567 --> 02:05:11,798
"No, he'll come soon"

993
02:05:13,572 --> 02:05:15,870
I have a feeling
he's coming back soon

994
02:05:52,678 --> 02:05:54,612
Where are you going?
Get back there

995
02:10:15,874 --> 02:10:21,574
God alone knows
what drove her to consume poison!

996
02:11:57,075 --> 02:12:01,944
"Even in death, we shall
not break our promise"

997
02:12:04,016 --> 02:12:08,976
"We will never part
from each other"

998
02:12:11,023 --> 02:12:15,983
"Ours is a relationship
spanning many births"

999
02:12:17,763 --> 02:12:22,325
"Who has ever separated
life from the body?"

1000
02:12:25,270 --> 02:12:31,175
Without you...

1001
02:12:32,077 --> 02:12:38,744
"without you, this ocean
has no shore, my love"

1002
02:12:53,966 --> 02:13:00,064
"In your name, I have bequeathed
my entire life, my love"

1003
02:13:09,081 --> 02:13:14,178
"My entire life, my love"
