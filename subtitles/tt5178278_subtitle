1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,875


3
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:32,500
Alpha!

4
00:03:32,542 --> 00:03:33,333
Sir!

5
00:03:33,375 --> 00:03:34,042
Beta!

6
00:03:34,042 --> 00:03:34,833
Sir!

7
00:03:34,917 --> 00:03:38,708
Our target is,
French Indo-Cartel Kingpin Brothers.

8
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:39,833
One.

9
00:03:43,042 --> 00:03:43,792
Two.

10
00:03:47,292 --> 00:03:48,292
And three.

11
00:03:54,542 --> 00:03:58,500
We now have intel
on the whereabouts of the eldest brother.

12
00:03:58,708 --> 00:04:02,917
He is on a private airfield,
on a jet flight, ready to take off.

13
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:06,917
Aplha Team, you should attack from the front.

14
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:10,167
Beta Team, you should attack from the back.

15
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:13,833
The Operation should be clear and clean.
- Sir!

16
00:05:09,792 --> 00:05:11,542
Target in sight.
Waiting for command, sir.

17
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:12,792
Yes, sir!

18
00:05:15,167 --> 00:05:16,000
What the hell?

19
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:16,958
What the hell?

20
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,917
Alpha, get me a gun.

21
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:22,250
Alpha, what the hell are you doing?

22
00:05:22,292 --> 00:05:24,167
Why do you address them
with their code name?

23
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:25,542
Michael.

24
00:05:26,917 --> 00:05:27,583
Stephen.

25
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:29,083
Christiano.

26
00:05:29,792 --> 00:05:30,458
Edward.

27
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:31,708
David.

28
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:35,000
Traitors! What did he pay to buy you off?

29
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,667
I never make offers to get my job done.

30
00:05:38,917 --> 00:05:40,125
That's not my style.

31
00:05:41,167 --> 00:05:42,375
I do it by taking.

32
00:05:44,667 --> 00:05:47,417
Don't cry!
Don't cry, my dear.

33
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,083
No!
- Move.

34
00:05:58,375 --> 00:06:00,167
A gift for your baby.

35
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:02,042
I'll blow your head. Calm down!

36
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:03,208
Don't do that. Please...

37
00:06:03,292 --> 00:06:05,417
Don't shout.
Or we'll shoot you both.

38
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:06,208
Don't do that!

39
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:11,292
If you'd had a family,
you'd be holding a gun, too.

40
00:06:12,042 --> 00:06:13,125
Not at gunpoint.

41
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:18,375
Whoever punches the maximum number
of bullets into your Leader's body...

42
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:20,833
I'll spare your family.

43
00:06:22,042 --> 00:06:22,917
Let's take off.

44
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:24,958
The climate is not working for us.

45
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:28,542
Apart from small things like
the rain, thunder and lightning...

46
00:06:28,917 --> 00:06:31,542
Everything else should be in our control.

47
00:06:31,792 --> 00:06:33,167
You can kill me now.

48
00:06:33,375 --> 00:06:37,083
But a better person than me;
A more righteous person...

49
00:06:37,167 --> 00:06:39,708
Will find all of you;
And kill you.

50
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:40,500
You're wrong.

51
00:06:42,542 --> 00:06:49,208
No good man, or honest man
can come anywhere close to me.

52
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:55,500
If there is a bad man;
Someone worse than me...

53
00:06:56,417 --> 00:06:58,417
Only he can touch me.

54
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:00,250
Take off.

55
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:06,250
Jump, jump, jump!

56
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:08,542
Left, left, left!

57
00:07:08,667 --> 00:07:10,625
Right, right, right!

58
00:07:10,667 --> 00:07:12,667
Fast, fast, fast!

59
00:07:13,667 --> 00:07:15,333
Brother, the train has arrived.

60
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,625
Hand me my lucky knife.

61
00:07:19,583 --> 00:07:20,750
Are your weapons ready?

62
00:07:20,792 --> 00:07:21,750
Yes, Boss!

63
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:23,292
Don't miss the target.

64
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:25,042
Brother, this is your 230th murder.

65
00:07:25,292 --> 00:07:26,042
Congrats, Brother.

66
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:28,875
Don't let him get away.

67
00:07:31,292 --> 00:07:32,208
Chatterjee!

68
00:07:32,375 --> 00:07:34,000
Have you bought the platform ticket?
- Oh, no! I forgot.

69
00:07:34,042 --> 00:07:35,042
Darn, you fool!

70
00:07:35,375 --> 00:07:36,667
We've planned a murder.

71
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:39,542
Want the Officer to catch you
in the platform without a ticket?

72
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:40,500
Ask him to buy it.

73
00:07:40,542 --> 00:07:41,750
Go, get it.
- Okay, Brother.

74
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:44,083
Hey, that's him!

75
00:07:44,583 --> 00:07:45,250
Don't let him go.

76
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:46,208
Guys, come on.

77
00:08:12,167 --> 00:08:14,083
Who is that?
Blocking my target with a rusty trunk?

78
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:14,792
Come on.

79
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:17,083
Go on, dear girl.

80
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:19,625
Brother, is this your knife?

81
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:21,917
It's not?

82
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:23,708
Darn. My lucky knife is gone!

83
00:08:24,292 --> 00:08:26,375
Brother, lift this trunk for me?

84
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:29,292
Our Great Kolkata Kali is now his porter?

85
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,625
Do you know who I am?

86
00:08:31,667 --> 00:08:32,625
I don't know, Brother.

87
00:08:33,042 --> 00:08:34,500
I'm Kolkata Kali!

88
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I know the whole of Kolkata city.

89
00:08:37,667 --> 00:08:39,833
And all of Kolkata knows me.

90
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:40,625
Wow!

91
00:08:40,917 --> 00:08:42,375
Tamizh.
- Who is that?

92
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:44,250
Come soon!
- I'm coming, Brother.

93
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:45,250
Come on!

94
00:08:48,917 --> 00:08:49,458
Guys...

95
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,250
Brother, please?

96
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:53,125
Tamizh, you were worried about
finding the place in a new city.

97
00:08:53,167 --> 00:08:54,917
Our Brother here knows
the whole city, it seems.

98
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:57,583
Brother, please tell me
where to find this address?

99
00:08:58,292 --> 00:08:59,042
Tell us, Brother.

100
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:01,833
What is this?

101
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,458
Our Target is getting away. Let's go.
- Oh yes.

102
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,917
Just a minute, Brother.

103
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:07,250
What your sister drew was very nice.

104
00:09:07,292 --> 00:09:09,208
My sister drew this.
- Who cares?

105
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:10,125
Let's go.

106
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:13,292
If you just pose steady,
she can draw you!

107
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:14,375
You're bald, too.

108
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:16,000
It'll be over in a jiffy.

109
00:09:16,917 --> 00:09:18,542
What do I look like to you?

110
00:09:18,667 --> 00:09:20,625
You?
You're just beautiful, Brother.

111
00:09:20,667 --> 00:09:26,250
"The whole world seems to spin around me;
My heart is screaming in ecstasy!"

112
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:32,125
"The Jupiter, with folded arms;
Stands before me, reverentially."

113
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:38,583
"I was just a damaged piece;
Look at the joker playing hero."

114
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:42,250
"This dry mound of clay gets chiseled..."

115
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:44,542
Brother, where do you need to go?

116
00:09:48,667 --> 00:09:49,833
This is the Howrah Bridge.

117
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:52,250
Beautiful!

118
00:09:53,167 --> 00:09:55,167
Hail our Lord Ganesha!

119
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:57,333
The Harbringer of good fortune!

120
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:02,833
Brother, this is the address
you had asked for.

121
00:10:10,917 --> 00:10:12,000
Thanks a lot, Brother.

122
00:10:12,792 --> 00:10:14,458
Brother to brother,
there should be no thanks.

123
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:15,625
Carry on, Ganesh.

124
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:17,542
So long!
- See you.

125
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:18,292
So long!

126
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:20,833
Superb!

127
00:10:20,917 --> 00:10:23,750
You were the Killer Kali.
Now he's turned you into Kind Kali.

128
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:24,958
What happened?

129
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,000
Chattarjee..
- What?

130
00:10:27,417 --> 00:10:29,625
Even the crow considers it's
little one to be golden.

131
00:10:29,917 --> 00:10:33,000
But even when I was a baby,
my mother sang the lullaby...

132
00:10:33,792 --> 00:10:40,083
"You crow-like Kali...
You dark Kali.."

133
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:41,958
Such was my life.

134
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:46,833
But this Brother said
I was "beautiful".

135
00:10:48,167 --> 00:10:50,167
Ganesh?
- Yes, Brother?

136
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:51,292
Come here.

137
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:53,042
I'll be back.
- Okay, Brother.

138
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:57,333
Great character!

139
00:10:57,833 --> 00:11:02,000
Everyone either gets afraid of me,
or stands up against me.

140
00:11:02,417 --> 00:11:05,667
But this guy minds his own business.

141
00:11:06,292 --> 00:11:10,833
He smiled at me.
He treated me like I'm human.

142
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:15,000
What is it, Brother?
- Give me your phone.

143
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:17,208
Here, Brother.

144
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:19,125
Come, take a selfie with me.

145
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:20,583
A selfie?
- Give me your phone.

146
00:11:24,042 --> 00:11:28,375
You've got an innocent face.
Make this your screensaver.

147
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:31,083
This will protect you
while you're in Kolkata.

148
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:31,875
Okay, Brother.

149
00:11:32,708 --> 00:11:33,333
So long!

150
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:34,750
Ganesh...
- Brother?

151
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:36,958
Smile for me?

152
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:38,833
Come on, Brother.

153
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:42,708
Bring our car.

154
00:11:44,292 --> 00:11:46,292
Hail our Lord Ganesha!

155
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:48,458
The Harbringer of good fortune!

156
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:56,792
Hold and tug, hey-ho!

157
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:58,625
Pull it hard, hey-ho!

158
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,417
You're a Tamilian, hey-ho?

159
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,000
I'm Ganesh from Chennai, hey-ho.

160
00:12:02,042 --> 00:12:04,333
The man we've been expecting,
with his sister? Hey-ho!

161
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:05,208
Where's the sister?

162
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:07,083
The girl in orange, hey-ho!

163
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:09,000
That's my daughter, hey-ho!

164
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:11,000
I was about to say,
the girl next to her. Hey-ho!

165
00:12:11,667 --> 00:12:13,417
The one in yellow saree is my wife.
Hey-ho!

166
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,458
Greetings, hey-ho!
- Hey-ho!

167
00:12:15,792 --> 00:12:19,167
Hold and tug, hey-ho!
- Hey-ho!

168
00:12:20,667 --> 00:12:24,792
Heard you were coming from Chennai.
So I cleared the top floor for you.

169
00:12:25,167 --> 00:12:27,875
So what brings you to Kolkata?

170
00:12:27,917 --> 00:12:30,125
I wanted to put my sister
in the College of Arts and Designs.

171
00:12:30,167 --> 00:12:32,042
Really?
- Yes, sir.

172
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:35,042
Bless me, Lord.

173
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,458
So, Ganesh?
Do you like the house?

174
00:12:49,042 --> 00:12:50,958
I like it, Brother.
It's superb.

175
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,375
We like it, sir.

176
00:12:52,667 --> 00:12:55,083
So sister's choice is your choice?

177
00:12:56,833 --> 00:13:00,292
We'll sit on a huge couch here!
- Superb.

178
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:04,500
We'll sit on the couch,
hang a huge T.V on the wall there.

179
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:05,292
What say?

180
00:13:05,667 --> 00:13:07,500
Sir, you're blocking the T.V!
Move away.

181
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:08,542
Move away!

182
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:11,292
A 65 inch LED TV.
- We'll buy one.

183
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:14,667
Tamizh, where do we keep the
double door refrigerator?

184
00:13:15,667 --> 00:13:17,167
Over here, Brother.

185
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:24,708
Ganesh! You forgot the A.C.

186
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:26,417
Superb idea, Brother.

187
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:27,250
Yes!

188
00:13:28,917 --> 00:13:32,500
We'll buy a 2.5 tonne A.C
for the living room!

189
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,833
Brother, we'll buy four A.Cs.

190
00:13:37,917 --> 00:13:39,792
Come on, Auntie.
Show us around the house.

191
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:41,917
You bring our bags.

192
00:13:43,292 --> 00:13:44,667
A washing machine here.

193
00:13:44,917 --> 00:13:46,958
And a wall clock over there.
- We'll buy it all.

194
00:13:47,167 --> 00:13:49,250
You get ready for college.
- Okay, Brother.

195
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:51,375
Ganesh, you've got a long shopping list.

196
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:53,625
Is this trunk filled with cash?

197
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:54,958
My sister wants it.

198
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,500
I will earn the money.

199
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,708
You WILL earn it?

200
00:13:58,917 --> 00:14:00,500
So you don't have a job?

201
00:14:00,917 --> 00:14:01,792
I'll find one.

202
00:14:01,917 --> 00:14:02,958
You'll find one?

203
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:04,792
You speak the local Bengali language?

204
00:14:05,417 --> 00:14:07,042
I'll learn it.
- You'll learn it?

205
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:12,000
Ganesh, you've moved to Kolkata city
with your sister and empty pockets.

206
00:14:12,292 --> 00:14:14,167
You don't have a plan. Right?

207
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:18,625
Brother, a man with a plan
is a man on his own.

208
00:14:19,042 --> 00:14:22,375
A man without a plan
has God for company.

209
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:30,750
Careful.

210
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:32,833
Thanks, sir.
- Thank you.

211
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,083
Everyone looks all shiny and rich.

212
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:44,000
Talent does not lie in form or attire.

213
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,292
It's right here.

214
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:46,208
Come.

215
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:57,250
Your painting talent is unique.
You're selected.

216
00:14:58,583 --> 00:14:59,875
She's really talented.

217
00:15:00,417 --> 00:15:02,125
I know that my sister is talented.

218
00:15:02,292 --> 00:15:04,542
Isn't this the top college
for this course?

219
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:07,292
Yes, why do you ask?

220
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:09,750
I will give my sister only the best.

221
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:12,917
You can fill in the form.
- Okay, sir.

222
00:15:13,167 --> 00:15:14,500
You can make the payment.

223
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:18,750
You have a great talent.

224
00:15:19,167 --> 00:15:22,833
Most importantly, you have a brother
who appreciates this talent.

225
00:15:23,417 --> 00:15:24,583
You're really blessed.

226
00:15:36,667 --> 00:15:37,958
Give it to me.
I'll hold it.

227
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:39,375
Hello?

228
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:42,375
I was just about to call you.

229
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:44,083
Sister has got an admit in the college!

230
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:45,042
That's great news.

231
00:15:45,292 --> 00:15:48,542
Looks like you might get a driver's job
at the place where I work.

232
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:49,833
The interview is tomorrow.

233
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:50,667
I'll be there.

234
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:54,333
Ganesh, my Boss is a strict guy.
Answer carefully at the interview.

235
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:56,458
Okay, Brother.
- That's Boss.

236
00:16:01,042 --> 00:16:02,167
Hello, son-in-law.

237
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,583
Mom-in-law...
- Son-in-law?

238
00:16:09,292 --> 00:16:12,250
Why is the mother-in-law
so respectful to her son-in-law?

239
00:16:12,417 --> 00:16:13,667
My Boss, Mr. Lakshmi Das.

240
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,833
He started off as a cleaner here.

241
00:16:16,167 --> 00:16:19,792
But seeing his Mr. Clean heart,
she made him the boss.

242
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:21,875
Dear, I am reach office.

243
00:16:22,167 --> 00:16:25,167
Sorry. You are deep sleeping.
So I didn't want to disturb you.

244
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:27,417
Drink some juice.
Eat your food.

245
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:29,750
Health is important.
My dear...

246
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:32,542
I want to sneeze. May I?

247
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:35,083
Go ahead and sneeze, dear.
- Thank you, dear.

248
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:39,125
Mom-in-Law?

249
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:42,625
Why do your eyes tear up
when I sneeze?

250
00:16:42,792 --> 00:16:47,042
Sneezing is the one thing
in the world that comes without consent.

251
00:16:47,417 --> 00:16:50,083
But you ask for my daughter's consent
even to sneeze?

252
00:16:50,167 --> 00:16:52,667
You're more than a son-in-law!
You're my son!

253
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:53,458
Mom-in-law!

254
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:56,250
Your daughter is not my wife.

255
00:16:57,375 --> 00:16:58,583
She's my whole life.

256
00:16:59,292 --> 00:17:00,375
Salute him!

257
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:06,167
Dear, I will come at 8 'o clock.
- Son-in-law...

258
00:17:07,792 --> 00:17:09,458
Sit down.
- Mom-in-law's affection!

259
00:17:09,875 --> 00:17:10,917
Awesome.

260
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:12,625
I'll take a leave.
- Please.

261
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:13,458
Thank you.

262
00:17:13,542 --> 00:17:15,167
Take care.
- Okay, Mummy.

263
00:17:17,667 --> 00:17:18,500
Take your seat.

264
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,625
The boy told me all about you.

265
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:24,125
Boy? Who?

266
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:26,042
The Boss meant me.

267
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:30,417
I will seem scary at first.

268
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:33,542
But as time goes by...
- You'll grow affectionate?

269
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:34,708
You'll grow accustomed.

270
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:40,417
To work here,
you need the 3-D.

271
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,167
Sir?

272
00:17:41,542 --> 00:17:42,958
You need these 3-D qualities.

273
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:44,625
Driving.

274
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,250
Discipline.

275
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:47,958
And Decency.

276
00:17:49,792 --> 00:17:52,583
Do you know to drive the car?

277
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Awesome.

278
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,167
Have it.

279
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:04,000
What is this?

280
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,333
Alcohol.

281
00:18:05,792 --> 00:18:08,375
So you don't drink.

282
00:18:08,667 --> 00:18:10,083
Not at all, sir.

283
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:12,833
Because, a man who drinks...

284
00:18:13,917 --> 00:18:15,542
Would put it down wistfully.

285
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:18,125
But you thrust it down.
I am correct?

286
00:18:18,167 --> 00:18:19,167
Correct, sir.

287
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:20,208
Awesome!

288
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:22,875
You don't have a smoking habit, either.

289
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:24,250
How did you..?

290
00:18:24,292 --> 00:18:27,250
When you entered my office
and crossed camera number 4...

291
00:18:27,542 --> 00:18:30,042
One of my men blew smoke
on your face.

292
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:34,417
I saw your face shrivel.

293
00:18:34,667 --> 00:18:35,708
Okay?

294
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:37,708
Now, let's test your decency.

295
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:41,083
Are you on Facebook?
- No, sir.

296
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:44,333
So you wouldn't upload a picture
and stress over the number of 'Like'.

297
00:18:44,792 --> 00:18:47,167
Are you on WhatsApp?
- No, sir.

298
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:47,875
Good.

299
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:52,500
So you won't form chat groups
and relish gossips.

300
00:18:53,167 --> 00:18:55,375
Are you on Twitter?
- No, sir.

301
00:18:55,667 --> 00:18:58,417
So you won't post your "opinions"
and hurt people's feelings.

302
00:18:58,458 --> 00:18:59,875
No, sir.
He's correct.

303
00:18:59,917 --> 00:19:00,375
So..

304
00:19:00,583 --> 00:19:03,583
You haven't fallen prey to the
social pressures.

305
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:06,458
That's why your smile is still fresh.

306
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:08,000
Thank you, sir.

307
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:09,458
Any doubts?

308
00:19:09,708 --> 00:19:10,708
Ask me.

309
00:19:10,917 --> 00:19:13,250
Go on, ask him.
- No, I shouldn't.

310
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:14,750
May I?
- Proceed.

311
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:17,042
Why do you wear a women's garment?

312
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,250
This is not!
These are designer wear for men.

313
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:25,083
Sorry, sir.
- He is an innocent lad.

314
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:29,625
You are innocent. I like you.

315
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:31,333
Yes. You are appointed.

316
00:19:32,667 --> 00:19:33,500
Thank you, Boss.

317
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,792
Are you serious?
You got the job?

318
00:19:47,875 --> 00:19:49,417
Yes, Tamizh. I've got the keys.

319
00:19:49,542 --> 00:19:50,667
That's great, Brother.

320
00:19:50,917 --> 00:19:52,708
Hope your first passenger is a good one!

321
00:19:52,792 --> 00:19:53,750
I hope so.

322
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:54,667
TAXI!

323
00:19:57,667 --> 00:20:01,542
Stop. Stop!
Taxi!

324
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:03,833
Taxi!

325
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:08,250
Driver, fix the car and take it home.
- Okay, Madam.

326
00:20:08,292 --> 00:20:10,583
What are you waiting for, cabbie?
Go to the Session Court.

327
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:13,125
Hello, juniors?
Listen to me.

328
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:15,125
Drive faster!
- Okay, Madam.

329
00:20:15,167 --> 00:20:16,375
Is the phony witness ready?

330
00:20:19,167 --> 00:20:20,042
Go, go, go!

331
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:21,875
Overtake them.
Fast.

332
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:23,125
Right away, Madam.

333
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:31,875
Not to worry. I'm here, now.

334
00:20:32,417 --> 00:20:34,000
Madam, my taxi fare of 150 rupees.

335
00:20:34,042 --> 00:20:35,500
We've lost every case till now.

336
00:20:35,542 --> 00:20:36,958
But not this one.
- Really?

337
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,458
Yeah. I've arranged a great perjurer.

338
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:41,125
Madam, my fare...

339
00:20:41,167 --> 00:20:44,625
Don't worry. You'll get released today.
I'm there for you.

340
00:20:44,667 --> 00:20:46,833
Follow me.
- Madam, 150 rupees!

341
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:50,167
The phony witness is a baby-face, right?
- A small baby-face.

342
00:20:50,417 --> 00:20:52,667
Innocent looking?
- Lovely, innocent looking guy.

343
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:53,917
The judge will buy it.
- Okay.

344
00:20:54,167 --> 00:20:55,833
Where is he?
-There he is.

345
00:20:57,583 --> 00:20:58,833
Good morning, Lawyer!

346
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:02,375
Got any pickle?
Pickle!

347
00:21:02,917 --> 00:21:03,917
Pickle.

348
00:21:04,792 --> 00:21:06,125
What is he saying?
I don't understand.

349
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:07,542
Senior, he's asking for pickle.

350
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:09,167
Pickle.
-Pickle?

351
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:11,000
Do you want it on a plate
or a jar?

352
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:12,292
Get up.

353
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,625
Say your dialogue.

354
00:21:14,917 --> 00:21:15,708
Say it!

355
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:20,333
I witnessed it with my own eyes...
Is there any pickle?

356
00:21:21,042 --> 00:21:21,750
Your honour!

357
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:24,958
Everything I say with this mouth...
is real.

358
00:21:25,208 --> 00:21:26,375
Do you have pickle?

359
00:21:26,417 --> 00:21:29,583
Senior, not just a baby-face.
He even has a baby's voice.

360
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,917
Hey, wake up!
Come on.

361
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:34,875
Wake up!

362
00:21:34,917 --> 00:21:36,792
Madam, you're up next.

363
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:39,833
Do you have pickle?
- You're asking her?

364
00:21:39,875 --> 00:21:42,917
Madam, you forgot my 150 rupees.

365
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:46,500
Pay up, Madam.

366
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:49,458
White skin.

367
00:21:49,583 --> 00:21:50,417
Baby face.

368
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:51,625
Innocent smile.

369
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:55,708
Want 150 rupees?

370
00:21:55,792 --> 00:21:56,833
I'll pay you.

371
00:21:56,917 --> 00:21:58,208
But will you do as I say?

372
00:21:58,542 --> 00:21:59,292
What should I do?

373
00:21:59,625 --> 00:22:03,167
Go to the court, do as I say.
Appear as witness before the judge.

374
00:22:03,292 --> 00:22:03,875
Okay?

375
00:22:04,542 --> 00:22:05,917
I don't speak Bengali language.

376
00:22:06,833 --> 00:22:07,708
Just miss!

377
00:22:07,833 --> 00:22:08,500
Juniors.

378
00:22:08,792 --> 00:22:10,333
Language is for those who can speak.

379
00:22:11,042 --> 00:22:12,542
From now, you're a mute.

380
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:14,167
You will pretend to be a mute.

381
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:21,167
Whenever I touch my forehead,
you will nod up and down at the judge.

382
00:22:21,292 --> 00:22:22,583
Okay? Show me.

383
00:22:22,625 --> 00:22:24,333
You didn't touch your forehead, madam.

384
00:22:24,833 --> 00:22:26,208
What a stunner!

385
00:22:29,208 --> 00:22:29,917
Once more?

386
00:22:51,583 --> 00:22:52,667
He's a stunner!

387
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:53,917
Get his address.

388
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,875
We'll use him as phony witness
for all our cases.

389
00:22:55,917 --> 00:22:58,167
He'll take us to great heights.

390
00:22:58,542 --> 00:22:59,458
Your honour...

391
00:23:03,917 --> 00:23:06,167
I rest my case, your honour.
-Objection, your honour.

392
00:23:06,333 --> 00:23:07,042
Sit down.

393
00:23:07,625 --> 00:23:08,708
Extraordinary.

394
00:23:10,458 --> 00:23:17,917
I express my appreciation to Shwetha
for diligently using a mute witness in this case.

395
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:24,750
As the charges against N. Mukherjee
could not be proved sufficiently...

396
00:23:24,958 --> 00:23:27,792
The court dismisses the case.

397
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,083
Sis.
- Brother?

398
00:23:32,375 --> 00:23:33,708
I'm leaving for college.

399
00:23:33,833 --> 00:23:34,458
Where are you?

400
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:37,208
I'm pretending to be a mute guy.
Can't talk for long now.

401
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:38,500
I'll call you back.

402
00:23:39,042 --> 00:23:39,792
What happened?

403
00:23:54,875 --> 00:23:57,292
What the hell have you done?
You stupid girl.

404
00:23:58,250 --> 00:23:59,375
Get out of my court.

405
00:24:00,333 --> 00:24:01,625
Don't ever show your face to me.

406
00:24:15,625 --> 00:24:16,292
Taxi!

407
00:24:17,792 --> 00:24:18,333
Come here.

408
00:24:21,542 --> 00:24:22,208
That's the car.

409
00:24:23,375 --> 00:24:24,083
Please sit.

410
00:24:32,333 --> 00:24:33,042
Tell me, Tamizh.

411
00:24:33,167 --> 00:24:36,125
Brother, classes got over early today.
Can you come pick me up?

412
00:24:37,958 --> 00:24:39,000
I've got a passenger.

413
00:24:39,625 --> 00:24:41,958
Sir, my sister's college
is on our way.

414
00:24:42,125 --> 00:24:43,083
Can I pick her up?

415
00:24:44,417 --> 00:24:45,542
Sure.
- Thank you, sir.

416
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:51,583
Tamizh, quick!

417
00:24:51,833 --> 00:24:52,792
Sorry, sir.
- It's okay.

418
00:24:53,542 --> 00:24:54,375
Let's go!

419
00:24:55,042 --> 00:24:57,208
Brother, I drew this
for a competition today.

420
00:24:57,250 --> 00:24:57,958
It's nice.

421
00:24:58,042 --> 00:25:00,167
This is my friend. I drew it.
-It's nice.

422
00:25:01,167 --> 00:25:01,917
And...

423
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:04,333
Sir, my sister drew this.

424
00:25:04,542 --> 00:25:06,625
This is my brother's and my
favourite drawing.

425
00:25:07,583 --> 00:25:08,500
We love it.

426
00:25:08,917 --> 00:25:09,792
Do you like it?

427
00:25:10,583 --> 00:25:11,375
Nice.

428
00:25:11,917 --> 00:25:13,750
Give me a paper
and I'll just keep drawing.

429
00:25:14,917 --> 00:25:17,750
Brother, I drew my friend.
- It's nice.

430
00:25:17,833 --> 00:25:18,792
Is it good?

431
00:25:25,833 --> 00:25:26,875
Brother, pull over.

432
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,125
Stop!

433
00:25:30,333 --> 00:25:31,542
This way, ma'am.

434
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:35,958
Come on.

435
00:25:38,917 --> 00:25:41,333
Bless you, child.

436
00:25:44,375 --> 00:25:45,583
Be careful.
- Okay, child.

437
00:25:54,583 --> 00:25:55,958
Bye, Brother.
- Okay!

438
00:25:57,958 --> 00:25:58,708
Excuse me!

439
00:25:59,333 --> 00:26:00,583
You left this behind.

440
00:26:02,375 --> 00:26:03,125
Thank you.

441
00:26:04,292 --> 00:26:05,542
What's his name...?

442
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:06,625
Arjun, sir?

443
00:26:06,833 --> 00:26:08,083
Arjun, sir.
Thank you.

444
00:26:08,958 --> 00:26:09,792
Okay, let's go.

445
00:26:15,208 --> 00:26:17,458
Mom, Dad!
-Arjun, welcome home.

446
00:26:18,167 --> 00:26:19,417
Bless me.
-Bless you.

447
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:20,375
Mom!

448
00:26:22,375 --> 00:26:23,125
How are you, Mom?

449
00:26:23,208 --> 00:26:24,000
I'm great!

450
00:26:24,125 --> 00:26:25,833
Arjun, how are you?
- I'm great.

451
00:26:27,708 --> 00:26:29,833
I'm proud of you.
-Did you buy chocolates for your mother?

452
00:26:29,917 --> 00:26:32,375
Where my sister Swetha?
- Answer me.

453
00:26:33,167 --> 00:26:35,500
She's started again.
Arjun, you've lost weight...

454
00:26:35,542 --> 00:26:36,875
Did my family take notice?

455
00:26:37,125 --> 00:26:39,875
Senior, they didn't care when
you got dismissed.

456
00:26:40,125 --> 00:26:41,708
Or when you threw the stuff.

457
00:26:41,833 --> 00:26:45,083
They seemed to notice the noise earlier.
But now, not even that.

458
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:48,208
I think whole family tries to insult you.

459
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:50,250
Sec IPL 20 20...

460
00:26:50,542 --> 00:26:52,292
Senior, this won't do.

461
00:26:52,542 --> 00:26:55,083
Something bigger.
Break something bigger!

462
00:26:55,292 --> 00:26:56,542
Big.
-Yes.

463
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:57,708
Something that big.

464
00:27:03,167 --> 00:27:06,458
Senior, you look so glamourous
in this pose.

465
00:27:07,458 --> 00:27:08,917
I meant, you look gallant.

466
00:27:10,583 --> 00:27:13,958
So, marriage next?
- Oh yes... Do that.

467
00:27:14,167 --> 00:27:15,458
Did they show reaction now?

468
00:27:15,583 --> 00:27:17,833
Heavy reaction.
But happy reaction.

469
00:27:18,208 --> 00:27:20,625
Senior, no value for breakables
in your house.

470
00:27:20,792 --> 00:27:22,292
See if they value you?
- How?

471
00:27:22,333 --> 00:27:23,583
Step ten feet backwards.

472
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:26,292
Come running fast...

473
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:30,958
Wow! Watching her run is so hot.

474
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:32,292
Run and?

475
00:27:32,333 --> 00:27:34,917
Run and commit suicide by jumping down
to the living room.

476
00:27:35,292 --> 00:27:38,208
How could they not react to splattering blood?
- That's a good idea.

477
00:27:38,792 --> 00:27:43,292
Run!

478
00:27:44,042 --> 00:27:46,000
It's okay.
Made in India item didn't work.

479
00:27:46,042 --> 00:27:47,375
Let's try foreign imported goods then?

480
00:27:47,583 --> 00:27:50,375
Swetha!
- Here comes the foreign imported.

481
00:27:50,458 --> 00:27:51,917
Sister!
- Brother!

482
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:52,833
This is for you.

483
00:27:53,083 --> 00:27:54,125
And this is for you!

484
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:56,875
I lost my job.
And you're giving me a gift?

485
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,583
Idiot! Fool.
- You've started again.

486
00:28:00,542 --> 00:28:02,167
Why do you hit him?
- Let him go!

487
00:28:02,208 --> 00:28:05,292
You've committed perjury at the court.

488
00:28:05,417 --> 00:28:07,750
A taxi driver got you fired.

489
00:28:08,333 --> 00:28:10,792
A taxi driver is why
I'm showering you with love.

490
00:28:10,833 --> 00:28:14,125
That taxi driver who got me fired
shall perish!

491
00:28:14,792 --> 00:28:15,250
Mom!

492
00:28:16,042 --> 00:28:17,917
I wish happiness for the
taxi driver I met.

493
00:28:27,375 --> 00:28:30,292
Hail our Lord Ganesha!

494
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:36,500
Our brave God Vinayaka, the victorious.
Our powerful God Vinayaka, the majestic.

495
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Bless us at all times,
With unbridled joy and kindest words;

496
00:28:56,208 --> 00:29:02,417
Loved progeny of Lord Eesa,
Could there be a consort like you?

497
00:29:02,625 --> 00:29:08,542
Our home, our country shall prosper;
You shall lift the souls that seek you.

498
00:29:08,708 --> 00:29:14,958
Now let's have a gala time;
This is the time for celebration!

499
00:29:15,125 --> 00:29:21,375
Just have a gala time;
This is our feast!

500
00:30:12,333 --> 00:30:18,458
All this carnage caused by cannons;
Lord, your love can heal all wounds.

501
00:30:18,667 --> 00:30:25,000
Limitless love, without reservation;
Makes hearts waltz in jubiliation.

502
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:31,417
Smile at the foe who is fierce and loud;
The smile shall make him turnaround.

503
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:37,417
Unblemished hearts of the chaste;
Will experience limitless solace.

504
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:03,042
Welcome to Kolkata, sir!

505
00:32:05,417 --> 00:32:06,292
Please.

506
00:32:08,333 --> 00:32:09,083
Hello, friends.

507
00:32:09,583 --> 00:32:12,792
I'm Yashpal.
Special Commissioner for Crimes in Kolkata.

508
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:17,208
I've gathered all the auto and taxi drivers
in the city for an important reason.

509
00:32:17,417 --> 00:32:18,125
Aniket.

510
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:21,000
Indo-French Cartel's crime family suspects.

511
00:32:22,125 --> 00:32:23,208
Get in, woman.

512
00:32:25,208 --> 00:32:28,750
He operates all over India
with base in Kolkata.

513
00:32:29,417 --> 00:32:31,708
But no evidence.
- Do you understand?

514
00:32:32,042 --> 00:32:35,292
He is supported by his older brothers,
Abhinay and Rahul.

515
00:32:35,625 --> 00:32:37,667
This racket is happening
at levels 8 to 10.

516
00:32:38,167 --> 00:32:42,417
With the intel we got,
we've shortlisted 30 men.

517
00:32:42,833 --> 00:32:44,833
Policemen can't be everywhere at all times.

518
00:32:45,125 --> 00:32:47,750
But you drivers go to
every nook and corner.

519
00:32:47,958 --> 00:32:53,083
If you see any of them,
or get any information, inform us.

520
00:32:53,458 --> 00:32:57,583
This small tip off from you
can help destroy a huge crime syndicate.

521
00:32:57,958 --> 00:33:01,250
The government will duly reward you...
- Sir!

522
00:33:01,333 --> 00:33:04,917
Why do you need to pay us?
We'll tell you, sir.

523
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,667
Ganesh! Just sit.
- Why, Boss?

524
00:33:08,792 --> 00:33:10,167
Why do you talk like that?

525
00:33:10,375 --> 00:33:11,833
You want their money?

526
00:33:13,042 --> 00:33:14,625
Money is not everything in life.

527
00:33:14,667 --> 00:33:18,208
Money is not everything.
But being alive is.

528
00:33:18,792 --> 00:33:22,500
They're not petty thieves.
They are terrorists!

529
00:33:23,792 --> 00:33:26,667
Think you're one of them
just because you're wearing a uniform?

530
00:33:27,208 --> 00:33:30,542
That's for cops.
This is for taxi drivers.

531
00:33:30,917 --> 00:33:32,167
Be quiet.

532
00:33:32,625 --> 00:33:35,458
Ganesh, you've come to Kolkata
with your sister.

533
00:33:35,833 --> 00:33:37,500
This is unnecessary.

534
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:39,417
Do inform us.

535
00:34:03,667 --> 00:34:06,542
Lawyer, madam! It's you.
For a second, I got scared.

536
00:34:06,917 --> 00:34:08,583
You've come to pay
my taxi fare 150 rupees?

537
00:34:08,917 --> 00:34:10,792
Oh, I forgot.
150?

538
00:34:12,667 --> 00:34:13,625
JUNIORS!

539
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,083
We've not come to settle your fare.
We've come to settle a score.

540
00:34:28,875 --> 00:34:33,708
If you want to touch my car;
Or my person...

541
00:34:33,958 --> 00:34:37,542
You'll have to face me first.
Do it if you can.

542
00:34:38,292 --> 00:34:39,958
Hail Goddess Kali!

543
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,167
No, Boss.
They're carrying strong weapons.

544
00:34:42,625 --> 00:34:46,917
They make be carrying strong weapons.
But I've got a smart weapon.

545
00:34:48,917 --> 00:34:49,583
Say cheese.

546
00:34:52,958 --> 00:34:54,542
Senior, strike a pose.

547
00:34:55,583 --> 00:34:56,833
Juniors!

548
00:34:56,875 --> 00:35:00,167
You're hiding your face.
Check out my pose.

549
00:35:00,958 --> 00:35:05,542
Lay a finger on my guy,
I'll send these pictures to the Commissioner.

550
00:35:06,417 --> 00:35:07,458
Listen to me.

551
00:35:07,625 --> 00:35:11,250
You're digging your own grave
by saving him.

552
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:14,708
Grave?
It's like eating gravy to me.

553
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:15,792
Shoo away.

554
00:35:16,417 --> 00:35:18,250
Boss, to repay this favour...

555
00:35:18,792 --> 00:35:21,792
I'll do something you'll never forget.

556
00:35:21,833 --> 00:35:23,917
Do that.
-He will do it.

557
00:35:24,083 --> 00:35:26,458
He struck me without warning.
But he's promised to do you.

558
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,083
He surely will.

559
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:29,625
Go away!

560
00:36:08,792 --> 00:36:09,833
Long live!

561
00:36:13,875 --> 00:36:14,583
Father!

562
00:36:55,042 --> 00:36:55,708
Brother...

563
00:36:56,667 --> 00:36:57,375
Okay.

564
00:37:19,417 --> 00:37:21,833
How have you been?
- Long time no see.

565
00:37:29,708 --> 00:37:32,167
Hello, Commissioner?
- Yes.

566
00:37:34,208 --> 00:37:35,333
How many of them?

567
00:37:36,667 --> 00:37:37,875
I'll be there immediately.

568
00:37:43,042 --> 00:37:44,292
Run!

569
00:37:44,958 --> 00:37:46,292
It's the cops.

570
00:37:47,542 --> 00:37:48,542
Run away!

571
00:37:52,708 --> 00:37:53,792
Amit!

572
00:37:56,292 --> 00:37:58,250
Why have you arraged
this urgent press meet?

573
00:37:58,333 --> 00:37:59,417
One at a time, please.

574
00:37:59,917 --> 00:38:01,667
The reason for this press meet...

575
00:38:02,083 --> 00:38:04,958
Is to tell you about
our first operation today.

576
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,708
We've siezed weapons and drugs
of great significance.

577
00:38:07,792 --> 00:38:10,625
We've only received information
on this guy...

578
00:38:10,625 --> 00:38:12,208
Who is your informer?

579
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:14,333
Sorry, I can't reveal the informer's name.

580
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:16,542
What I wish to tell the people
of Kolkata is this...

581
00:38:16,667 --> 00:38:20,042
We managed to catch this guy
with an ordinary citizen's tip off.

582
00:38:20,625 --> 00:38:25,917
If we have the co-operation of public,
we can wipe out these social evils.

583
00:38:28,417 --> 00:38:31,542
I want that informer.
I want that informer now!

584
00:38:34,583 --> 00:38:37,250
You came back from London to get married.

585
00:38:37,375 --> 00:38:39,125
But you reject every girl
your parents pick.

586
00:38:39,167 --> 00:38:41,083
Is there no girl in Kolkata you like?

587
00:38:41,458 --> 00:38:42,667
Not exactly.

588
00:38:46,375 --> 00:38:47,958
I like her, man.
-Dude!

589
00:38:50,292 --> 00:38:51,583
Dude, what are you saying?

590
00:38:51,625 --> 00:38:53,750
Get lost.
- All the best, dude.

591
00:39:02,708 --> 00:39:03,208
Sir...

592
00:39:07,042 --> 00:39:07,958
I know, sir.

593
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,667
I know you've been
after my sister.

594
00:39:14,583 --> 00:39:15,333
Please, don't.

595
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,875
Do you know why women can't
walk peacefully in our country?

596
00:39:19,875 --> 00:39:21,667
Because they're afraid
of being followed.

597
00:39:23,042 --> 00:39:24,125
Let the girls walk.

598
00:39:24,792 --> 00:39:25,917
Let them go to school...

599
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:27,208
To college.

600
00:39:27,708 --> 00:39:28,833
Let them go to work.

601
00:39:30,125 --> 00:39:31,125
In peace.

602
00:39:33,417 --> 00:39:36,125
If you like a girl, tell her, sir.

603
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:39,750
If she likes you, too...
Marry her.

604
00:39:40,625 --> 00:39:41,500
If she doesn't...

605
00:39:42,208 --> 00:39:45,375
Chasing and stalking doesn't make a man.

606
00:39:46,125 --> 00:39:49,667
One who respects her feelings
and walks away- he's a man.

607
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:53,167
I'm off, sir.

608
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:04,125
My baby! My darling!

609
00:40:04,167 --> 00:40:05,583
My sweetie pie...

610
00:40:06,417 --> 00:40:08,875
Hubby, I'm feeling shy!

611
00:40:08,958 --> 00:40:11,375
Did you drink milk.
- Not going to the temple?

612
00:40:11,417 --> 00:40:15,292
I'm on my way to the temple.
There's a Dance of Ecstasy at the temple.

613
00:40:15,375 --> 00:40:18,083
Okay, hubby. Be safe.
- Okay.

614
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:19,208
Boss.

615
00:40:20,208 --> 00:40:20,792
Boss?

616
00:40:21,458 --> 00:40:22,167
Boss!

617
00:40:31,208 --> 00:40:32,000
BOSS!

618
00:40:32,333 --> 00:40:33,083
Is that you?

619
00:40:33,167 --> 00:40:35,958
Too much shock. Too much shock.

620
00:40:36,167 --> 00:40:38,667
I'm Lakshmi Das only till 6.

621
00:40:38,792 --> 00:40:41,708
After 6, I'm Sexy Das.

622
00:40:41,792 --> 00:40:45,458
Can't believe it.
- Too much shock. Too much shock.

623
00:40:45,542 --> 00:40:54,750
Behind every man who publicly
calls his wife "Honey, dear, sweetums"...

624
00:40:55,083 --> 00:40:59,792
Lies a private means of
enjoyment like this.

625
00:40:59,833 --> 00:41:01,417
But you're betraying Lakshmi Ma'am!

626
00:41:01,833 --> 00:41:04,917
Too much shock. Too much shock.

627
00:41:05,208 --> 00:41:07,583
What I'm doing now is not betrayal.

628
00:41:07,833 --> 00:41:13,417
When I sabotaged her six weddings
and became her husband...

629
00:41:13,917 --> 00:41:17,125
Ended up as the owner for this
Call Taxi Company.

630
00:41:17,625 --> 00:41:21,125
That's when this Tale of Betrayal begun.

631
00:41:21,583 --> 00:41:22,583
Here's my phone.

632
00:41:22,875 --> 00:41:25,458
My wife will call every five minutes.

633
00:41:25,708 --> 00:41:28,833
I've told her I am at
the Dance of Ecstacy at the temple.

634
00:41:28,875 --> 00:41:32,208
Even if she cross-questions you,
don't let it slip.

635
00:41:32,375 --> 00:41:33,083
Lies?

636
00:41:33,417 --> 00:41:37,750
Are you going to speak the truth?
Or be truthful to your Boss?

637
00:41:38,375 --> 00:41:41,458
You gave me a job.
I'll be truthful to you.

638
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:44,458
Your loyalty is awesome.

639
00:41:44,667 --> 00:41:45,708
Girls!

640
00:41:49,625 --> 00:41:52,042
Tell me, Lakshmi Ma'am.
- What is he doing?

641
00:41:56,542 --> 00:41:57,958
He is doing the Dance of Ecstacy.

642
00:41:58,042 --> 00:41:59,833
He never eats on time.

643
00:42:04,625 --> 00:42:08,083
He's eating now.
-He doesn't even drink water.

644
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,208
He's drinking now, Ma'am.

645
00:42:23,417 --> 00:42:25,417
Not the kind of hips
you'd see in a pub.

646
00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:27,500
Another one here?

647
00:42:28,958 --> 00:42:30,958
Are these dancers or bouncers?

648
00:42:36,792 --> 00:42:40,375
Ganesh! You've come in, too?

649
00:42:42,625 --> 00:42:45,375
You want some enjoyment, too?

650
00:42:46,458 --> 00:42:47,083
No!

651
00:42:47,833 --> 00:42:49,750
Drink some juice on my tab.

652
00:42:49,958 --> 00:42:52,625
Go, man!
Have it, have it.

653
00:42:53,833 --> 00:42:56,250
Please rotate.

654
00:42:58,292 --> 00:42:59,292
Mom-in-law?

655
00:43:00,667 --> 00:43:01,708
You're a dead-in-law.

656
00:43:01,875 --> 00:43:05,000
You punk!

657
00:43:05,083 --> 00:43:07,000
I trusted you with my daughter.

658
00:43:07,125 --> 00:43:09,833
You sucked my blood.
You're drinking juice?

659
00:43:12,250 --> 00:43:15,417
You asked me to rotate my hips?
I'll break yours.

660
00:43:18,458 --> 00:43:21,042
Want to go pubbing, do you?

661
00:43:21,375 --> 00:43:24,750
This is the temple?
Your Dance of Ecstacy?

662
00:43:24,833 --> 00:43:27,167
Get down.
Get down!

663
00:43:28,917 --> 00:43:31,500
I'll grind your brains out.

664
00:43:33,875 --> 00:43:36,125
You've tattooed my baby's face!

665
00:43:37,417 --> 00:43:39,125
Boss? Boss?

666
00:43:39,708 --> 00:43:40,792
Where are you, Boss?

667
00:43:43,542 --> 00:43:45,083
Boss, what happened?

668
00:43:45,167 --> 00:43:48,125
Too little shock. Too little shock.

669
00:43:48,667 --> 00:43:50,292
Boss, what happened?

670
00:43:51,333 --> 00:43:52,292
You rascal.

671
00:43:52,375 --> 00:43:56,833
All the times when I told you to be loyal...

672
00:43:57,708 --> 00:44:02,375
You just bobbed your head
up and down.

673
00:44:03,542 --> 00:44:09,250
Even I couldn't have revealed so many
of my secrets, darn it!

674
00:44:09,333 --> 00:44:12,417
Why would you do this to me?

675
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:13,083
Boss.

676
00:44:13,708 --> 00:44:15,750
Do you know what Lakshmi Ma'am said
over the phone?

677
00:44:18,125 --> 00:44:21,167
He doesn't even drink water.
- He's drinking now.

678
00:44:21,458 --> 00:44:23,917
Take good care of him, Brother.

679
00:44:24,333 --> 00:44:25,000
I don't get it.

680
00:44:25,083 --> 00:44:27,625
I don't see why you betrayed me.
- You didn't pay attention.

681
00:44:27,833 --> 00:44:28,833
Pay closer attention.

682
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:31,917
Take good care of him, Brother.

683
00:44:32,208 --> 00:44:35,167
What did you call me?
- Brother! Brother!

684
00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:35,958
Brother.

685
00:44:39,542 --> 00:44:41,333
You betrayed me
because she called you Brother?

686
00:44:41,417 --> 00:44:42,083
Yes, Boss.

687
00:44:42,125 --> 00:44:43,083
Damn you!

688
00:44:44,667 --> 00:44:46,000
Tell me, Tamizh.
- Where are you, Brother?

689
00:44:46,042 --> 00:44:47,958
Who is this?
- My own sister.

690
00:44:48,167 --> 00:44:49,167
Tell me, sis.

691
00:44:49,208 --> 00:44:51,083
You have your own sister.

692
00:44:51,167 --> 00:44:53,250
Why did you borrow my wife
to be your sister?

693
00:44:53,250 --> 00:44:54,875
You have destroyed my life.

694
00:44:54,958 --> 00:44:58,333
Someone will destroy yours!

695
00:46:11,083 --> 00:46:12,208
Brother.
We've got him.

696
00:46:12,375 --> 00:46:13,250
Come on!

697
00:46:13,583 --> 00:46:14,833
Drag him down here.

698
00:46:30,250 --> 00:46:32,375
Sir, they've got the wrong guy.

699
00:46:32,542 --> 00:46:33,500
Please let me go.

700
00:46:33,583 --> 00:46:36,667
Wrong guy?
You are the man we're after.

701
00:46:39,375 --> 00:46:41,250
Kill him.
-Let me go, sir.

702
00:46:41,375 --> 00:46:44,000
Throw his head into the sea!
- Please let me go, sir.

703
00:46:46,875 --> 00:46:48,083
Sir, let me go!

704
00:47:00,958 --> 00:47:02,000
Who is it?

705
00:47:09,708 --> 00:47:10,250
Sir...

706
00:47:11,375 --> 00:47:12,500
How did you come up here?
- Sir...

707
00:47:12,542 --> 00:47:15,083
They're hitting me real bad.
I can't take it.

708
00:47:15,333 --> 00:47:16,708
They've got the wrong guy.

709
00:47:17,083 --> 00:47:21,458
Sir, he just has to say the word.
Let me go! Please, sir.

710
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,750
Please let me go..
- Kill the guy.

711
00:47:25,917 --> 00:47:26,500
Sir!

712
00:48:44,167 --> 00:48:45,625
Are we done yet?

713
00:48:55,625 --> 00:48:58,000
Let the fireworks begin!

714
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:22,000
Let go!

715
00:50:27,917 --> 00:50:29,208
Hey, let him go.

716
00:50:43,375 --> 00:50:44,833
We got the wrong man.
Please let me go.

717
00:50:44,917 --> 00:50:46,417
Not the wrong man...

718
00:50:46,542 --> 00:50:48,000
I'm the right man.

719
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:50,917
You didn't get me...

720
00:50:52,375 --> 00:50:54,250
I came to you.

721
00:50:54,542 --> 00:50:56,125
I've come for you.

722
00:50:56,167 --> 00:50:58,542
Son of a...
I've come to claim your life.

723
00:50:58,583 --> 00:50:59,500
My life?

724
00:51:09,167 --> 00:51:12,542
I'm begging you. Spare my life!
Let me go.

725
00:51:14,333 --> 00:51:15,125
Let me go!

726
00:51:16,042 --> 00:51:17,833
Please, let me go...
Let me go.

727
00:51:39,667 --> 00:51:43,000
Brother! It's half past one.
Why haven't you returned home yet?

728
00:51:43,375 --> 00:51:46,625
I'm sorry, Tamizh.
This passenger is a foreigner.

729
00:51:47,083 --> 00:51:50,042
He hopped on to the taxi
and refuses to leave.

730
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:53,417
I'll come home when he departs.
Okay?

731
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:55,667
Hand him the phone, Brother.
- I will.

732
00:51:58,792 --> 00:52:00,083
It's my sister.

733
00:52:00,833 --> 00:52:01,417
Sir...

734
00:52:02,750 --> 00:52:04,500
My brother can't go without food
for too long.

735
00:52:04,542 --> 00:52:07,833
If you leave soon,
my brother can come home, too.

736
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:09,250
Please leave, sir?

737
00:52:10,125 --> 00:52:13,583
Now that you've told him...
He'll be on his way.

738
00:52:16,958 --> 00:52:19,167
Who are you?
Russian Mafia?

739
00:52:19,250 --> 00:52:20,542
Mexican Cartel?

740
00:52:20,583 --> 00:52:23,083
Intelligence agent?
Or a policeman?

741
00:52:23,250 --> 00:52:26,625
Russian Mafia? Or Mexican Cartel?
Intelligence agent?

742
00:52:26,958 --> 00:52:29,458
Or a policeman? Who am I?

743
00:52:33,625 --> 00:52:34,167
NO!

744
00:52:45,458 --> 00:52:47,958
What took you so long?
There was a power cut, too.

745
00:52:52,333 --> 00:52:54,542
I'm hungry. Is there food?

746
00:52:55,292 --> 00:52:58,083
Of course! Wash your hands.
I'll fix your meal.

747
00:53:03,958 --> 00:53:05,125
Serve me more rice.

748
00:53:05,167 --> 00:53:07,083
You must have been starving!

749
00:53:07,375 --> 00:53:09,500
You could have settled
for whatever was available to eat.

750
00:53:09,750 --> 00:53:11,708
Rather than just settling...

751
00:53:11,875 --> 00:53:13,625
I like to wait patiently...

752
00:53:14,667 --> 00:53:19,750
Starve myself, and then kill the hunger
with your food, sis.

753
00:53:20,292 --> 00:53:21,542
Too hungry, Brother?

754
00:53:22,917 --> 00:53:26,708
My heart is at peace.
Let's appease my stomach, too.

755
00:53:27,458 --> 00:53:28,333
Serve some more.

756
00:54:16,833 --> 00:54:18,000
Where is my little brother?

757
00:54:37,583 --> 00:54:39,583
Have them perform a post-mortem.

758
00:54:42,958 --> 00:54:44,833
Sir...
The post-mortem reports.

759
00:54:45,250 --> 00:54:46,708
Looks like a professional killer?

760
00:54:46,833 --> 00:54:49,875
This wasn't done by a professional.
This is personal.

761
00:54:50,583 --> 00:54:55,208
It was not done for remuneration.
It's an act of revenge.

762
00:54:55,625 --> 00:55:00,583
He's stabbed the body
ten times after my brother died.

763
00:55:00,792 --> 00:55:02,042
Maybe a policeman?

764
00:55:02,208 --> 00:55:03,792
It's not a policeman.

765
00:55:04,458 --> 00:55:07,750
He's attacked like a forest flood.

766
00:55:08,750 --> 00:55:11,667
None of this is organised.
He's not a policeman!

767
00:55:14,250 --> 00:55:16,375
Not the slightest trace of evidence.

768
00:55:16,917 --> 00:55:19,333
He's well versed in criminology.

769
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:22,875
I think he's a cut-throat criminal.

770
00:55:25,958 --> 00:55:27,000
Shall we tell Older Brother?

771
00:55:27,083 --> 00:55:29,250
Would you dare to tell him?

772
00:55:30,708 --> 00:55:34,875
Before the news of his little brother's
death reaches his ears...

773
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:39,500
We should lay the corpse of the killer
before his eyes.

774
00:55:40,333 --> 00:55:41,417
Who is he?

775
00:55:41,833 --> 00:55:42,792
Catch it, Uncle.

776
00:55:43,167 --> 00:55:44,125
Bye, Aunty.

777
00:55:45,042 --> 00:55:46,708
He's messed with such big wigs.

778
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:50,125
He must have disappeared from Kolkata.

779
00:55:53,625 --> 00:55:56,208
My gut feeling tells me...

780
00:55:57,250 --> 00:56:02,000
He'd be on his way to kill me, too.

781
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:06,250
Before he could get to me...

782
00:56:06,375 --> 00:56:11,167
I will track him down
and slaughter him.

783
00:56:17,042 --> 00:56:19,333
Tamizh, answer the door.
- Okay, Brother.

784
00:56:22,083 --> 00:56:23,083
Arjun, sir! How come..?

785
00:56:23,458 --> 00:56:25,333
They asked for your address.
So I brought them here.

786
00:56:25,958 --> 00:56:27,958
Mom, this is Tamizh.
- Are you well?

787
00:56:28,750 --> 00:56:30,500
Tamizh, these are my parents.

788
00:56:30,667 --> 00:56:31,833
Hi, Aunty. Hi, Uncle.

789
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,250
Hello!
- Please be seated.

790
00:56:34,792 --> 00:56:35,542
Brother!

791
00:56:37,792 --> 00:56:39,708
Would you like coffee or tea?
- Just sit with us.

792
00:56:39,875 --> 00:56:42,125
Just sit. We want to talk to you
about something important.

793
00:56:42,250 --> 00:56:43,042
Tell me, Aunty!

794
00:56:43,208 --> 00:56:45,042
You see... Well...

795
00:56:47,833 --> 00:56:49,000
Tell me, Aunty.

796
00:56:49,083 --> 00:56:50,792
You tell her!

797
00:56:51,667 --> 00:56:53,167
The thing is...

798
00:56:55,125 --> 00:56:56,208
What is it, Uncle?

799
00:56:56,708 --> 00:56:57,542
You tell her.

800
00:56:58,333 --> 00:57:00,708
Actually, I...

801
00:57:01,708 --> 00:57:02,625
Will you..?

802
00:57:03,333 --> 00:57:05,083
Feeling shy, Arjun sir?

803
00:57:05,833 --> 00:57:07,208
Mom, you tell her.

804
00:57:07,333 --> 00:57:07,917
Me?

805
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,208
Aunty, just tell me.

806
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,250
Look...

807
00:57:11,375 --> 00:57:12,708
Will you be our daughter-in-law?

808
00:57:12,917 --> 00:57:15,208
Is that it?
Why did you hesitate...

809
00:57:17,333 --> 00:57:18,042
Brother!

810
00:57:20,833 --> 00:57:23,583
Ganesh, they've come to ask your sister's
hand in marriage.

811
00:57:23,750 --> 00:57:25,667
They're a well respected family in Kolkata.

812
00:57:26,167 --> 00:57:27,333
Hello!
- Hello.

813
00:57:28,708 --> 00:57:29,333
Please sit.

814
00:57:33,958 --> 00:57:35,125
Don't mistake us.

815
00:57:35,917 --> 00:57:37,542
For coming here unannounced.

816
00:57:38,458 --> 00:57:40,542
We looked at
many prospective brides for Arjun.

817
00:57:40,708 --> 00:57:44,083
He rejects every girl because they are
not like your sister.

818
00:57:45,167 --> 00:57:46,792
Rather than finding
someone like her...

819
00:57:46,875 --> 00:57:48,583
We came to ask
for your sister's alliance.

820
00:57:49,458 --> 00:57:52,375
Don't mistake us for proposing
to a girl pursuing her education.

821
00:57:52,917 --> 00:57:56,000
Now your sister is a student.
Our daughter-in-law could be one, too.

822
00:57:56,417 --> 00:57:59,458
More than a daughter-in-law,
we'll care for her like our own daughter.

823
00:58:00,375 --> 00:58:02,542
I don't know if I can
care for her like you do.

824
00:58:03,083 --> 00:58:04,792
But I promise to take very good care.

825
00:58:05,625 --> 00:58:07,375
This is not for us to discuss.

826
00:58:08,458 --> 00:58:10,375
Ask your sister
if she's interested in marriage;

827
00:58:10,875 --> 00:58:13,208
And if she's interested in marrying me.

828
00:58:30,542 --> 00:58:32,583
I'm used to seeing you
with a smile on your face.

829
00:58:33,542 --> 00:58:35,167
I've never seen you so tense.

830
00:58:37,750 --> 00:58:39,250
If you're okay, I'm okay with it.

831
00:58:39,458 --> 00:58:41,000
If you don't want it,
I don't want it either.

832
00:58:41,167 --> 00:58:42,583
Your decision is mine, Brother.

833
00:58:43,333 --> 00:58:44,125
Tell them that.

834
00:58:50,708 --> 00:58:53,792
Ganesh, don't think too hard.
Give them a positive response...

835
00:59:30,625 --> 00:59:31,583
Is the killer dead?

836
00:59:31,792 --> 00:59:34,750
It's not them.
They didn't do it.

837
00:59:35,417 --> 00:59:38,500
While dying, there was only
fear in their eyes.

838
00:59:38,958 --> 00:59:40,292
Not vengeance.

839
00:59:40,958 --> 00:59:44,292
This murder was not to settle
professional scores.

840
00:59:45,208 --> 00:59:48,250
This murderer is a professional
at settling scores.

841
00:59:48,417 --> 00:59:49,917
Shall we tell Older Brother now?

842
00:59:50,042 --> 00:59:50,750
OUT!

843
01:00:01,542 --> 01:00:02,083
Brother...

844
01:00:02,250 --> 01:00:05,000
I've been calling for two days now.
Little Brother hasn't answered his phone.

845
01:00:05,167 --> 01:00:05,750
Where is he?

846
01:00:05,958 --> 01:00:08,125
He is far, far away.

847
01:00:10,083 --> 01:00:11,125
Is everything alright?

848
01:00:12,083 --> 01:00:15,167
Yeah, perfect.
I'll call you back.

849
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:21,333
Where are you?

850
01:00:28,417 --> 01:00:30,542
Quick! It's getting late.
- Almost done.

851
01:00:31,958 --> 01:00:34,000
Sis, the dome is ready.
Where is Boss?

852
01:00:34,042 --> 01:00:36,250
Don't worry about the foul-mouth.

853
01:00:36,333 --> 01:00:38,083
He would be where he belongs.

854
01:00:38,125 --> 01:00:40,917
All that's left to do
is scrubbing toilets in this colony...

855
01:00:41,083 --> 01:00:42,375
Scrub properly, foul-mouth!

856
01:00:42,417 --> 01:00:44,958
Even free-loaders are goading me.

857
01:00:48,750 --> 01:00:49,708
Why is she here?!

858
01:00:51,250 --> 01:00:52,208
Lakshmi Das!

859
01:00:53,917 --> 01:00:55,125
Lakshmi Das?

860
01:00:55,292 --> 01:00:58,750
Didn't that Smiling Killer
bring this doom upon you?

861
01:01:03,958 --> 01:01:07,375
You saved him;
But he butchered you, didn't he?

862
01:01:09,750 --> 01:01:14,125
You tried to shield him.
Nicely punctured his shield, did he?

863
01:01:15,792 --> 01:01:17,958
He ruined you career...

864
01:01:18,083 --> 01:01:22,208
And on the way,
he ruined my whole life!

865
01:01:23,792 --> 01:01:25,792
What are you doing here?

866
01:01:25,958 --> 01:01:29,125
It's my brother's engagement.

867
01:01:30,333 --> 01:01:33,000
Take two steps backward, please?

868
01:01:41,042 --> 01:01:42,625
Why do you laugh like a maniac?

869
01:01:42,667 --> 01:01:45,083
Your brother is the groom.

870
01:01:45,167 --> 01:01:46,667
The bride's brother...

871
01:01:46,750 --> 01:01:48,625
Guess who it is?

872
01:01:48,667 --> 01:01:49,667
I don't know.

873
01:01:50,292 --> 01:01:51,792
Look over there!

874
01:01:51,917 --> 01:01:55,500
That baby-face with a loin-cloth
around his waist.

875
01:01:55,833 --> 01:01:56,958
It's him.

876
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:01,542
You've seen men selling soaps on wholesale
or even briefs...

877
01:02:02,083 --> 01:02:03,708
Ever seen a guy sell grief?

878
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:07,333
This man?

879
01:02:08,083 --> 01:02:09,250
In my family?

880
01:02:09,833 --> 01:02:10,292
Mom...

881
01:02:10,375 --> 01:02:12,333
I need to tell you...
- Come here.

882
01:02:12,833 --> 01:02:13,583
It's my daughter.

883
01:02:13,625 --> 01:02:15,417
She's a criminal lawyer.
But she lost her job.

884
01:02:15,583 --> 01:02:18,083
You have a big heart,
so you have forgiven me. Thanks.

885
01:02:18,125 --> 01:02:21,583
We need to call off the engagement.
- Stop talking like a loony.

886
01:02:21,625 --> 01:02:22,458
Get some work done.

887
01:02:22,625 --> 01:02:25,417
Dad, we need to talk alone.
- Carry on.

888
01:02:26,125 --> 01:02:29,042
Brother, don't you like me a lot?

889
01:02:29,333 --> 01:02:31,250
You'll do as I say?

890
01:02:32,750 --> 01:02:34,083
Call off this engagement?

891
01:02:34,167 --> 01:02:34,875
Brother...

892
01:02:35,042 --> 01:02:36,708
Don't you hate your sister?

893
01:02:36,875 --> 01:02:39,000
Won't you smack her in the face?

894
01:02:39,250 --> 01:02:45,000
He's all set for his wedding night.
And you're telling him to call it off?

895
01:02:48,042 --> 01:02:49,167
What a waste...

896
01:02:56,500 --> 01:02:59,875
Ganesh, this is not the time to tear up.
Be cheerful!

897
01:03:00,167 --> 01:03:01,375
Let's seal the deal.

898
01:03:03,083 --> 01:03:04,333
Go on. Take it.

899
01:03:05,542 --> 01:03:09,417
You've studied law.
Don't you know your rights as a sis-in-law?

900
01:03:09,750 --> 01:03:14,958
When a bride enters her new home,
her sister-in-law...

901
01:03:15,208 --> 01:03:18,667
Has every right
to toss her around to heart's content.

902
01:03:18,833 --> 01:03:20,333
For the sake of his sister...

903
01:03:20,458 --> 01:03:22,667
If you command him to stand,
he should stand.

904
01:03:22,792 --> 01:03:25,250
If you command him to sit,
he should still remain standing.

905
01:03:25,375 --> 01:03:26,333
That's his fate.

906
01:03:26,458 --> 01:03:29,458
Your prey has found it's way
into the lion's den.

907
01:03:29,625 --> 01:03:31,333
This is our time!

908
01:03:31,750 --> 01:03:34,500
Chart a timetable to torture him.

909
01:03:35,542 --> 01:03:38,083
Awesome, awesome!

910
01:03:38,500 --> 01:03:40,542
I'll hold that smile of his...

911
01:03:41,042 --> 01:03:43,750
Ransom, ransom!

912
01:03:44,833 --> 01:03:47,208
Don't you mess with me

913
01:03:48,167 --> 01:03:50,375
Don't you mess with me

914
01:03:50,458 --> 01:03:52,583
The reason why I hate the guy is this :

915
01:03:52,667 --> 01:03:54,250
He's not compliant.

916
01:03:54,292 --> 01:03:57,500
Attacking a tornado;
But he's so not malleable.

917
01:03:57,583 --> 01:04:03,833
He'd never wear a mask;
Or get flirty talking to women.

918
01:04:03,875 --> 01:04:08,667
He'd never speak lies.
He won't cross the line.

919
01:04:08,833 --> 01:04:10,833
Oh no, he won't!
He won't let me go.

920
01:04:10,917 --> 01:04:17,458
Yelling doesn't tick him off;
He's just unbeatable.

921
01:04:17,958 --> 01:04:23,833
How much longer now?
Stop acting like a good man!

922
01:04:24,583 --> 01:04:30,375
What is your plan?
Why do you ruin my life?

923
01:04:44,417 --> 01:04:47,667
All you girls around the world;
Single, taken, complicated

924
01:04:47,708 --> 01:04:51,042
It don’t matter where you’re from
Say with me, say with me, say...

925
01:05:06,708 --> 01:05:07,583
Why, man?

926
01:05:09,875 --> 01:05:10,833
I'm telling you.

927
01:05:13,250 --> 01:05:14,250
You're pissing me off.

928
01:05:16,167 --> 01:05:17,583
Don't speak English?

929
01:05:34,583 --> 01:05:36,792
Killing us with that smile!

930
01:05:37,083 --> 01:05:40,167
Is it over?
Can we never wipe out that smile?

931
01:05:40,417 --> 01:05:43,208
We've lost a lot in life.
But feels like we've lost in life!

932
01:05:43,250 --> 01:05:46,042
We accept our defeat.
We shall accept our failure.

933
01:05:46,583 --> 01:05:47,250
You've found it.

934
01:05:47,458 --> 01:05:48,083
You've found it.

935
01:05:48,250 --> 01:05:50,792
You've found the perfect idea
to ruin his happiness.

936
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:52,333
Tell me. Tell me!

937
01:05:52,625 --> 01:05:55,375
See if the print is alright.
- It's nice. See?

938
01:05:55,500 --> 01:05:57,083
Tamizh?
- It's Swetha here.

939
01:05:57,292 --> 01:05:59,333
Tell me.
- Your sister met with an accident!

940
01:05:59,458 --> 01:06:01,792
What are you saying?
- She's very critical.

941
01:06:03,458 --> 01:06:04,083
Hi!

942
01:06:04,333 --> 01:06:05,875
What's happened to Tamizh?
Hello!

943
01:06:13,917 --> 01:06:14,417
Hello.

944
01:06:14,542 --> 01:06:16,208
I'm so scared. Please come soon.

945
01:06:16,250 --> 01:06:17,250
What happened?

946
01:06:17,417 --> 01:06:19,750
Not just her leg;
She's hurt her head, too.

947
01:06:20,875 --> 01:06:21,792
Take care of her!

948
01:06:21,833 --> 01:06:24,250
The doctor is here
but I don't understand what he's saying.

949
01:06:24,333 --> 01:06:26,583
Come soon! Hello?
- Hello?

950
01:06:27,958 --> 01:06:29,375
The smile is gone.
- It's gone?

951
01:06:29,542 --> 01:06:31,042
My fair lady!

952
01:06:33,417 --> 01:06:34,500
Come fast!

953
01:06:34,667 --> 01:06:36,083
Come on. Come on.

954
01:06:36,625 --> 01:06:38,250
Smile is gone!

955
01:06:38,333 --> 01:06:38,958
Tamizh!

956
01:06:42,083 --> 01:06:42,833
Senior...

957
01:06:45,542 --> 01:06:47,083
Tamizh!
- I'm okay, Brother.

958
01:06:47,875 --> 01:06:49,083
Are you alright?
- I'm alright.

959
01:06:49,333 --> 01:06:50,583
Why did you come running?

960
01:06:51,667 --> 01:06:52,542
What happened, Brother?

961
01:06:52,958 --> 01:06:53,542
Brother?

962
01:06:55,167 --> 01:06:56,667
Brother, tell me.

963
01:06:56,875 --> 01:06:58,042
Sir, what happened?

964
01:06:59,083 --> 01:06:59,792
Oh no!

965
01:06:59,958 --> 01:07:01,500
What happened, sir?
Why are you so nervous?

966
01:07:01,583 --> 01:07:02,583
Run away! Quick...

967
01:07:02,625 --> 01:07:03,625
What happened, Brother?

968
01:07:04,167 --> 01:07:05,083
It's nothing.

969
01:07:05,958 --> 01:07:07,083
Why are you crying?

970
01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:08,208
Are you okay?

971
01:07:10,708 --> 01:07:11,417
Miss...

972
01:07:12,917 --> 01:07:15,042
I know you did this to hurt me.

973
01:07:16,792 --> 01:07:18,542
I could have told your parents
what happened.

974
01:07:22,042 --> 01:07:23,625
It's my little sister's future home.

975
01:07:25,542 --> 01:07:29,375
A girl's family
trusts not just the groom...

976
01:07:31,292 --> 01:07:33,542
But the women in her future family
to take care of her.

977
01:07:38,583 --> 01:07:40,667
I'm trusting you with my sister.

978
01:07:42,583 --> 01:07:45,833
If you want to hurt me,
do whatever you want. Really.

979
01:07:47,167 --> 01:07:51,125
But don't hurt my sister, even as a joke.

980
01:07:54,125 --> 01:07:55,208
I can't take that.

981
01:08:06,958 --> 01:08:08,250
Careful, Partner.

982
01:08:12,292 --> 01:08:14,083
Don't let him change that expression.

983
01:08:14,333 --> 01:08:17,208
Even his sworn enemy
can't resist appreciating him.

984
01:08:17,417 --> 01:08:21,792
Even one who wants to destroy him,
would admire him, deep down.

985
01:08:22,708 --> 01:08:24,250
Careful, Partner.

986
01:08:25,583 --> 01:08:28,792
Beating up a hundred men;
Breathing fury, standing tall

987
01:08:28,875 --> 01:08:31,292
That was my idea of a man

988
01:08:32,042 --> 01:08:35,417
But overwhelmed in love;
Shedding tears for a woman

989
01:08:35,500 --> 01:08:37,917
Now I say,
That's the stuff of real men

990
01:08:38,833 --> 01:08:44,250
I thought love would hit me,
With a man's kiss and caress

991
01:08:45,500 --> 01:08:48,750
Here I am, standing afar
Quietly, I let my eyes talk

992
01:08:48,792 --> 01:08:51,000
And here I am,
Falling in love with him!

993
01:08:51,083 --> 01:08:54,167
He is the truth;
In a world of lies

994
01:08:54,333 --> 01:08:57,375
In this world of mess;
He's my clarity

995
01:08:57,583 --> 01:09:00,875
He's a sweet melody;
At times when I am coy

996
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:04,167
I've lost my heart now;
He's in my head, that man!

997
01:09:05,292 --> 01:09:11,042
With that gentle smile,
He cleanses my heart

998
01:09:11,917 --> 01:09:17,667
But with that gait of his,
He gives me dirty thoughts

999
01:09:33,583 --> 01:09:36,792
All you girls around the world;
Single, taken, complicated

1000
01:09:36,875 --> 01:09:40,000
It don’t matter where you’re from
Say with me, say with me, say...

1001
01:09:53,375 --> 01:09:56,708
You're the you're the one-
You're my man

1002
01:09:59,042 --> 01:10:00,042
You turn me on

1003
01:10:02,375 --> 01:10:03,333
I love you

1004
01:10:21,792 --> 01:10:23,750
Hello?
Is this Chief Yard Control?

1005
01:10:23,792 --> 01:10:26,792
Yes, sir.
-I'm calling from Private Deck Yard #101.

1006
01:10:26,875 --> 01:10:30,583
500m from where our yard had been parked...

1007
01:10:30,708 --> 01:10:32,167
Four days ago...

1008
01:10:32,292 --> 01:10:34,750
Was there any International ship parked?

1009
01:10:34,833 --> 01:10:36,333
Yes, sir.
It's a Japanese ship.

1010
01:10:36,375 --> 01:10:39,167
Where is that Japanese ship now?

1011
01:10:40,500 --> 01:10:45,333
Every International ship has surveillance cameras
covering 360 degrees.

1012
01:10:45,458 --> 01:10:50,167
The murder would have been recorded
in at least one of them.

1013
01:10:50,250 --> 01:10:52,333
Just get me that harddisk!

1014
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,583
Is the harddisk here?
- It's already on the way, sir.

1015
01:11:03,458 --> 01:11:05,292
Sir, the DNAs are not matching.

1016
01:11:07,667 --> 01:11:08,500
Sir, the harddisk.

1017
01:11:10,333 --> 01:11:11,250
Load it up!

1018
01:11:12,875 --> 01:11:14,208
It's getting uploaded, sir.

1019
01:11:15,708 --> 01:11:18,375
8 of the 32 cameras have
captured the murder.

1020
01:11:25,625 --> 01:11:26,875
On your screen, sir.

1021
01:11:29,417 --> 01:11:30,875
Killer's height-
5'11"

1022
01:11:32,958 --> 01:11:34,708
The killer has a fair complexion.

1023
01:11:37,417 --> 01:11:39,083
Hair colour-
salt and pepper.

1024
01:11:39,292 --> 01:11:42,625
The killer is well-built,
right handed, with strong arms.

1025
01:11:43,792 --> 01:11:45,667
The killer's body type is mesomorphic.

1026
01:11:46,125 --> 01:11:47,917
These are his physical parameters.

1027
01:11:50,375 --> 01:11:53,958
Not just this footage;
We've checked every ship's CCTV footage.

1028
01:11:54,042 --> 01:11:56,667
He knew each and every blind spot
in the surveillance.

1029
01:11:56,833 --> 01:11:58,833
It's perfecty pre-planned and  pre-meditated.

1030
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:00,708
It's a well-executed murder, sir.

1031
01:12:04,292 --> 01:12:05,292
Something...

1032
01:12:06,458 --> 01:12:08,375
Something is missing.

1033
01:12:12,375 --> 01:12:14,208
Camera 5 to all screens.

1034
01:12:27,792 --> 01:12:28,708
Got it!

1035
01:12:29,667 --> 01:12:31,208
He received a phonecall.

1036
01:12:31,750 --> 01:12:36,500
At 1:30 last night, Port Area's tower
was activated with an incoming call.

1037
01:12:36,792 --> 01:12:40,208
It was connected to another tower
in the city.

1038
01:12:40,750 --> 01:12:44,708
Call duration- 1 minute and 23 seconds.

1039
01:12:45,042 --> 01:12:47,875
Can you put this information to use?
- Can can, sir.

1040
01:12:48,083 --> 01:12:49,000
We can trace him.

1041
01:12:49,208 --> 01:12:49,792
How?

1042
01:12:49,875 --> 01:12:53,292
Can lock down his mobile signal signature pattern
by the Advance Tracking System.

1043
01:12:53,542 --> 01:12:56,292
All we need is just one phonecall-
from that mobile to this mobile.

1044
01:12:56,333 --> 01:12:57,583
Or this mobile to that mobile.

1045
01:12:57,792 --> 01:12:59,625
We need this call to sustain
for just five minutes, sir.

1046
01:12:59,750 --> 01:13:02,375
Sir, we can lock the two mobiles
down to 5 foot radius.

1047
01:13:02,417 --> 01:13:03,542
Just do it!

1048
01:13:05,542 --> 01:13:06,667
Waiting for the call, sir.

1049
01:13:09,250 --> 01:13:12,125
Make the call. Come on.
Make the call.

1050
01:13:13,125 --> 01:13:14,250
Make the call!

1051
01:13:18,583 --> 01:13:19,917
Sir, call is in progress!

1052
01:13:20,375 --> 01:13:22,792
Where are you?
WHERE ARE YOU?

1053
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:29,417
Come on, where are you?
Attend the call.

1054
01:13:29,708 --> 01:13:32,042
Come on, come on.
Answer!

1055
01:13:35,208 --> 01:13:37,000
Sir, the second call is connected.

1056
01:13:38,750 --> 01:13:40,708
If the call prolongs for
another four and a half minutes...

1057
01:13:40,792 --> 01:13:42,750
We can lock their locations, sir.

1058
01:13:43,125 --> 01:13:44,708
Come on!

1059
01:13:52,542 --> 01:13:54,333
Come on, come on!

1060
01:13:58,917 --> 01:14:00,500
Three more minutes...

1061
01:14:03,417 --> 01:14:04,417
Two minutes more, sir.

1062
01:14:04,583 --> 01:14:06,125
Locked down to 5 foot distance, sir.

1063
01:14:07,667 --> 01:14:10,042
Gharia Hut, sir.
Hundred metres away from the target, sir.

1064
01:14:12,750 --> 01:14:13,750
Street locked, sir.

1065
01:14:13,833 --> 01:14:16,042
Fifty metres away from the target.
- Rashbhihari Avenue.

1066
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:20,542
Lock the G.P.S.

1067
01:14:26,542 --> 01:14:27,667
G.P.S locked, sir.

1068
01:14:27,750 --> 01:14:28,792
Hit squad!

1069
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,625
There's a man holding a phone
with this G.P.S.

1070
01:14:36,667 --> 01:14:39,042
Bring his head to me-
In a platter!

1071
01:14:39,417 --> 01:14:40,708
Go, go, go!

1072
01:14:41,708 --> 01:14:44,208
If the call lasts another minute,
we can trace the second caller, too.

1073
01:14:44,250 --> 01:14:45,542
Where are you?

1074
01:14:52,833 --> 01:14:54,750
We're locking the second caller's area, sir.

1075
01:14:58,167 --> 01:14:59,208
Where are you?

1076
01:14:59,542 --> 01:15:01,042
Where are you?

1077
01:15:01,625 --> 01:15:02,333
Ganesh?

1078
01:15:04,292 --> 01:15:06,542
He was right here. Where has he gone?
- This way, madam.

1079
01:15:06,625 --> 01:15:07,667
Thirty seconds more, sir!

1080
01:15:09,417 --> 01:15:10,625
Ten seconds more, sir.

1081
01:15:13,375 --> 01:15:14,208
Sir, area locke-...

1082
01:15:16,042 --> 01:15:17,417
What's happened?

1083
01:15:18,250 --> 01:15:19,250
The area has been locked, sir.

1084
01:15:19,333 --> 01:15:20,458
Which area?

1085
01:15:20,958 --> 01:15:22,000
The area we are at, sir.

1086
01:15:26,458 --> 01:15:29,708
In this area...?
- In this street, sir.

1087
01:15:31,333 --> 01:15:33,125
In this street..?

1088
01:15:33,708 --> 01:15:34,417
In this...

1089
01:15:35,042 --> 01:15:35,917
In this building, sir.

1090
01:15:37,958 --> 01:15:39,750
In this building..?

1091
01:15:40,917 --> 01:15:42,000
He's coming up, sir!

1092
01:15:45,792 --> 01:15:46,833
I told you.

1093
01:15:47,250 --> 01:15:49,417
He isn't the type to run and hide.

1094
01:15:50,417 --> 01:15:52,750
He's the type
which hunts down and attacks.

1095
01:15:54,083 --> 01:15:55,917
Here he is!

1096
01:16:01,042 --> 01:16:02,292
He's coming up in the lift, sir.

1097
01:16:02,375 --> 01:16:03,542
Technical team- OUT!

1098
01:16:05,583 --> 01:16:08,292
Let's hunt him down.

1099
01:16:08,625 --> 01:16:09,917
Attack Squad!

1100
01:16:31,250 --> 01:16:32,667
Come on...

1101
01:17:10,583 --> 01:17:13,083
Now he'll turn the lights out.

1102
01:17:29,958 --> 01:17:31,458
Hello.

1103
01:17:32,917 --> 01:17:35,292
Mic testing One...

1104
01:17:36,500 --> 01:17:37,875
Two...

1105
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:40,333
Three...

1106
01:17:40,375 --> 01:17:43,042
Who are you?
Where are you now?

1107
01:17:43,625 --> 01:17:47,000
Hide and seek, won't you play?

1108
01:17:47,125 --> 01:17:50,167
Take a guess, who am I?

1109
01:17:51,542 --> 01:17:54,250
Come here.
Face me if you dare.

1110
01:17:55,208 --> 01:17:57,083
I've been here for a while.

1111
01:17:58,542 --> 01:17:59,500
Mate...

1112
01:17:59,917 --> 01:18:02,667
The two men behind you shall fly.

1113
01:18:09,667 --> 01:18:12,292
You said you'd attack the men behind me;
But you hit the ones in front.

1114
01:18:12,417 --> 01:18:13,292
Who are you?

1115
01:18:13,542 --> 01:18:15,333
Should I keep my word?

1116
01:18:15,458 --> 01:18:19,167
Are you a National Leader?
Am I a National Leader?

1117
01:18:21,292 --> 01:18:22,792
You are a bad man.

1118
01:18:25,333 --> 01:18:28,125
I am a godforsaken man.

1119
01:20:05,750 --> 01:20:08,042
Hit me, hit me, hit me.

1120
01:20:08,083 --> 01:20:09,667
HIT ME!

1121
01:21:04,833 --> 01:21:06,333
Ganesh! Where is he?

1122
01:21:25,625 --> 01:21:26,458
Hello?

1123
01:21:27,250 --> 01:21:27,917
Who is this?

1124
01:21:27,958 --> 01:21:29,750
The killer of your little brother.

1125
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
Presently killing your other brother!

1126
01:21:37,292 --> 01:21:38,500
Who are you?

1127
01:21:38,750 --> 01:21:39,667
Me?

1128
01:21:39,792 --> 01:21:44,250
My role in your life
is as important as your parents'.

1129
01:21:44,750 --> 01:21:46,583
There's just one difference.

1130
01:21:47,042 --> 01:21:48,917
They gave birth to you.

1131
01:21:50,667 --> 01:21:52,750
I will kill you.

1132
01:21:53,292 --> 01:21:54,917
Don't!

1133
01:21:54,958 --> 01:21:59,667
The person you are trying to reach
is currently committing a murder...

1134
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:03,625
Please try again later.

1135
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:24,417
Where are you going?

1136
01:22:24,792 --> 01:22:27,083
Murderer!
Are you a murderer?

1137
01:22:27,208 --> 01:22:29,458
Yes!
I am a murderer.

1138
01:22:33,458 --> 01:22:35,208
I will commit another murder...

1139
01:22:36,667 --> 01:22:39,792
Of anyone who comes in the way.

1140
01:22:40,208 --> 01:22:43,917
Even if it's you;
I will slit your throat.

1141
01:22:44,708 --> 01:22:46,917
We won't marry into a killer's family.

1142
01:22:47,375 --> 01:22:49,792
I won't let my brother marry your sister.

1143
01:22:50,250 --> 01:22:51,875
I will stop this wedding!

1144
01:22:54,625 --> 01:22:58,292
If you have a problem with an alliance
with a killer's family...

1145
01:22:58,542 --> 01:23:00,292
I'll tell you something now.

1146
01:23:00,792 --> 01:23:04,667
The woman your brother is about to marry
is not my sister.

1147
01:23:15,250 --> 01:23:17,333
She is not even my sister.

1148
01:23:23,375 --> 01:23:25,625
Tamizh is not my sister.

1149
01:23:44,333 --> 01:23:46,625
Tamizh is not my sister.

1150
01:24:06,042 --> 01:24:07,833
Sir, Vedalam has been caught!

1151
01:24:07,917 --> 01:24:08,875
Really?

1152
01:24:09,333 --> 01:24:12,542
Done collecting all his records
from every station?

1153
01:24:12,583 --> 01:24:13,542
It's on the way, sir.

1154
01:24:15,083 --> 01:24:16,042
So, is it done?

1155
01:24:16,083 --> 01:24:17,333
Our stock of papers is done!

1156
01:24:18,958 --> 01:24:20,625
Is he such a big shot?

1157
01:24:22,208 --> 01:24:23,208
I can't do it.

1158
01:24:23,542 --> 01:24:25,083
He simply won't budge.

1159
01:24:25,292 --> 01:24:27,458
No matter how much I hit,
he doesn't budge.

1160
01:24:27,542 --> 01:24:28,500
Let me see.

1161
01:24:28,958 --> 01:24:30,250
This is Vedalam.

1162
01:24:44,875 --> 01:24:47,792
Why should we address him with respect?
Is he some big shot?

1163
01:24:47,917 --> 01:24:49,000
Call him by his name.

1164
01:24:49,208 --> 01:24:51,208
I can't call him Vedalam.

1165
01:24:51,250 --> 01:24:53,292
His real name is Ganesh, right?
-Yes.

1166
01:24:53,375 --> 01:24:54,375
Ganesh...

1167
01:24:55,417 --> 01:24:58,625
In Madras, there are pick pockets,
hitmen, murderers...

1168
01:24:58,667 --> 01:24:59,917
Those are the four types of thugs.

1169
01:25:00,083 --> 01:25:06,042
Heard you're a blend of all these
different types in one person.

1170
01:25:06,292 --> 01:25:12,583
After I, Manimaran, give you my special treatment,
you'll just stay home like a good boy.

1171
01:25:16,792 --> 01:25:19,083
No matter how much I hit,
he won't budge.

1172
01:25:23,667 --> 01:25:24,708
Where is Manimaran?

1173
01:25:26,917 --> 01:25:28,667
Come on out!
- What's the noise?

1174
01:25:28,750 --> 01:25:29,958
Where is my brother Manimaran?

1175
01:25:34,625 --> 01:25:37,417
Thugs have entered the station
with weapons, sir.

1176
01:25:37,583 --> 01:25:38,750
Maybe they are his men?

1177
01:25:38,792 --> 01:25:41,000
He belongs to no gang.
He won't call for help, either.

1178
01:25:41,042 --> 01:25:42,375
Your brother Manimaran is in there.

1179
01:25:42,417 --> 01:25:44,292
Your brother has come here
to bash you up.

1180
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:46,625
How do I get away from my brother?

1181
01:25:46,667 --> 01:25:49,792
There's only one way to get away
from your brother now.

1182
01:25:49,833 --> 01:25:51,250
But these men are standing outside.

1183
01:25:51,333 --> 01:25:54,042
I didn't mean that way.
- But there's only a wall here.

1184
01:25:54,083 --> 01:25:55,750
Vedalam is here, sir.

1185
01:25:56,042 --> 01:25:57,125
What are you saying?

1186
01:25:57,167 --> 01:25:58,833
Let's ask for Vedalam's help, sir.

1187
01:25:59,208 --> 01:26:01,958
We've thrashed him all morning;
Beaten him black and blue.

1188
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:03,583
Why would he help us?

1189
01:26:03,833 --> 01:26:05,625
Vedalam needs just one thing;

1190
01:26:05,833 --> 01:26:08,042
He doesn't care for vengeance,
love or affection.

1191
01:26:08,083 --> 01:26:09,208
What is that thing?

1192
01:26:15,708 --> 01:26:16,667
Ganesh...

1193
01:26:16,958 --> 01:26:18,500
Call him Vedalam!

1194
01:26:19,458 --> 01:26:20,833
You're a dead guy!

1195
01:26:22,958 --> 01:26:24,042
Vedalam...

1196
01:26:28,625 --> 01:26:32,750
Money is... the almighty!

1197
01:26:33,167 --> 01:26:37,708
The almighty... knows it, too.

1198
01:26:38,792 --> 01:26:40,333
What's the matter?
- Need to hit them.

1199
01:26:40,750 --> 01:26:41,833
Can do.

1200
01:26:42,292 --> 01:26:44,625
Give me money.
How many people?

1201
01:26:44,750 --> 01:26:45,833
Around twenty of them.

1202
01:26:46,167 --> 01:26:47,833
Two thousand per head.

1203
01:26:48,167 --> 01:26:49,292
Get me forty thousand!

1204
01:26:49,833 --> 01:26:51,250
I only have thirty thousand.

1205
01:26:51,333 --> 01:26:52,667
Shall I pay ten thousand later?

1206
01:26:52,708 --> 01:26:53,917
Shall I hit five men later?

1207
01:26:54,917 --> 01:26:56,625
Funny guy, funny guy.

1208
01:26:56,667 --> 01:26:58,917
He's being so cocky!

1209
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:00,833
I have ten thousand. I'll pay.

1210
01:27:17,458 --> 01:27:18,250
No...

1211
01:27:18,792 --> 01:27:19,792
No need for this, Vedalam.

1212
01:27:19,833 --> 01:27:22,083
What do you think I'm offering?

1213
01:27:22,583 --> 01:27:23,958
This has no connection with you.

1214
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:25,000
You're right.

1215
01:27:25,208 --> 01:27:27,167
But a scene took place
two minutes back.

1216
01:27:27,292 --> 01:27:30,583
After the scene, the connection...
became strong.

1217
01:27:34,292 --> 01:27:34,875
Come!

1218
01:27:36,125 --> 01:27:38,250
Thought you could buy me off?

1219
01:27:38,708 --> 01:27:40,208
How much is there?
- Fifty thousand.

1220
01:27:40,333 --> 01:27:42,042
Sir, how much did you pay?

1221
01:27:42,083 --> 01:27:43,208
Forty thousand!

1222
01:27:46,083 --> 01:27:47,042
Poor things.

1223
01:27:47,917 --> 01:27:49,833
They look innocent!

1224
01:27:50,958 --> 01:27:52,542
How could you haggle with them?

1225
01:27:52,625 --> 01:27:54,667
When did we haggle?

1226
01:27:54,750 --> 01:27:56,083
He's telling us to haggle, sir.

1227
01:27:57,417 --> 01:28:01,208
That chain is my father-in-law's present!
My wife would kill me.

1228
01:28:30,958 --> 01:28:34,458
It's yours;
It's all yours

1229
01:28:35,042 --> 01:28:38,500
It's yours;
It's all yours

1230
01:28:38,667 --> 01:28:42,458
You're the reason I live;
I'm all yours

1231
01:28:58,167 --> 01:29:01,583
Why is it?
Oh, why is it?

1232
01:29:01,708 --> 01:29:05,583
Why is it, dear?
That you're so far away?

1233
01:29:17,542 --> 01:29:19,250
Sir, call me when you need me.

1234
01:29:19,292 --> 01:29:20,292
Okay, Vedalam.

1235
01:29:23,125 --> 01:29:25,667
Where injustice prevails;
Where there is crime...

1236
01:29:25,708 --> 01:29:27,167
Vedalam will be there.

1237
01:29:28,292 --> 01:29:30,375
Because he's the man behind it.

1238
01:29:42,333 --> 01:29:45,292
This racous man here;
He is quite a riot, y'know?

1239
01:29:45,292 --> 01:29:48,250
Cut that cheap swag;
Or he will cut it for you.

1240
01:29:54,250 --> 01:29:56,958
Fresh from the pan,
Nothing like a bellyfull.

1241
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,875
Check out the local lass;
Glossy skin like she's loaded

1242
01:30:05,917 --> 01:30:08,750
Dum-dee-da; Dum-dee-ding;
Keep those Dolaks roaring

1243
01:30:08,792 --> 01:30:11,833
I have let my marble roll;
What do I care how it goes?

1244
01:30:11,875 --> 01:30:14,583
Want to blow hot and cold?
Watch me split that jaw-bone.

1245
01:30:14,625 --> 01:30:17,833
The last of booze has my name on it;
I will drink solo, what's it to you?

1246
01:30:47,875 --> 01:30:53,583
I'm a cheeky kid turned classy rowdy;
And my punches, they're worth your last penny.

1247
01:30:59,750 --> 01:31:05,542
Robbery, forgery, petty crimes are such a bore;
Carve a name in murder, that's a real chore.

1248
01:31:11,500 --> 01:31:17,375
Let him yell, let him pounce;
Hold still, your time will come.

1249
01:31:17,417 --> 01:31:23,458
Young blood raging, I struck a blow;
I kick, I fight- that's the rowdy's show.

1250
01:31:41,250 --> 01:31:43,708
Just be cool, mate.

1251
01:31:43,750 --> 01:31:46,917
High or low;
Just be cool.

1252
01:31:47,208 --> 01:31:49,542
Just be cool, mate.
You must be cool.

1253
01:31:49,583 --> 01:31:53,000
Men may come and men may go;
You gotta stay cool.

1254
01:33:31,958 --> 01:33:33,875
Oh no! Sir, what happened?

1255
01:33:34,625 --> 01:33:35,417
Sir?

1256
01:33:35,708 --> 01:33:37,083
Girl!

1257
01:33:37,583 --> 01:33:38,792
Just go.

1258
01:33:39,042 --> 01:33:40,208
Keep going.

1259
01:33:40,708 --> 01:33:42,458
This is none of your business.

1260
01:33:42,625 --> 01:33:43,417
Please, sir.

1261
01:33:45,250 --> 01:33:46,042
Sir!

1262
01:33:46,792 --> 01:33:48,208
They've stabbed you in the back.

1263
01:33:48,417 --> 01:33:51,625
I've been stabbed in the back
too many times now.

1264
01:33:51,708 --> 01:33:52,833
I'm used to it.

1265
01:33:53,208 --> 01:33:54,333
Keep going.

1266
01:33:55,083 --> 01:33:56,417
You're bleeding badly!

1267
01:33:56,458 --> 01:33:58,958
Just go.

1268
01:34:08,708 --> 01:34:11,583
Madam, someone stabbed him.
Admit him, please!

1269
01:34:12,458 --> 01:34:13,625
This is a police issue.

1270
01:34:13,750 --> 01:34:16,458
You need to file a case first.
Can't admit the patient now.

1271
01:34:16,500 --> 01:34:17,625
Take him away.

1272
01:34:18,208 --> 01:34:20,083
He's bleeding very badly.
Poor man...

1273
01:34:20,583 --> 01:34:21,917
Please, Madam.
Admit him.

1274
01:34:22,292 --> 01:34:24,167
Okay, how is he related to you?

1275
01:34:27,875 --> 01:34:28,917
This man?

1276
01:34:29,250 --> 01:34:30,625
He's a murderer!

1277
01:34:31,125 --> 01:34:32,500
This man is a thug.

1278
01:34:33,292 --> 01:34:35,750
What do you care?

1279
01:34:35,875 --> 01:34:39,417
Just drop him where you picked him up
and be on your way, Miss.

1280
01:34:46,208 --> 01:34:47,083
He is my brother.

1281
01:34:48,958 --> 01:34:49,625
My brother...

1282
01:34:49,667 --> 01:34:53,542
The girl said he's her brother.
Just admit him, quick!

1283
01:34:53,958 --> 01:34:56,042
Inform the doctor.
Take him to the ward, immediately.

1284
01:34:56,042 --> 01:34:57,750
Thanks, Madam.
Thanks a lot.

1285
01:35:02,333 --> 01:35:07,167
We need O positive blood. You are?
- Mine is O positive, I'll donate.

1286
01:35:32,167 --> 01:35:34,417
Doctor, where is the man in that bed?

1287
01:35:34,458 --> 01:35:35,750
He left in the morning.

1288
01:35:37,542 --> 01:35:40,583
The second he regained consiousness,
he just left.

1289
01:35:59,042 --> 01:36:02,917
Tamizh, you said you admitted
a man in the hospital. Is he well?

1290
01:36:02,958 --> 01:36:04,625
He's well.
He got discharged this morning.

1291
01:36:04,667 --> 01:36:08,542
Daddy prayed for his recovery all night.

1292
01:36:08,583 --> 01:36:12,000
Tamizh, Esther is here.
- Give her something to eat, mom.

1293
01:36:12,042 --> 01:36:13,333
I am eating already.

1294
01:36:13,375 --> 01:36:15,250
We're getting late for college.
Get ready soon.

1295
01:36:16,417 --> 01:36:19,917
Where is my sketch book?
- Tamizh, it's on the second drawer.

1296
01:36:20,667 --> 01:36:21,667
It's not here!

1297
01:36:23,417 --> 01:36:24,833
Look properly, dear.

1298
01:36:26,167 --> 01:36:26,750
Here.

1299
01:36:28,083 --> 01:36:28,792
Thanks, Dad.

1300
01:36:29,958 --> 01:36:30,583
Mom?

1301
01:36:31,250 --> 01:36:32,583
Where is the brush bag?

1302
01:36:33,208 --> 01:36:33,875
Here.

1303
01:36:34,458 --> 01:36:35,167
Thanks, Mom.

1304
01:36:35,375 --> 01:36:36,542
Come to the prayer room.

1305
01:36:51,792 --> 01:36:52,417
Uncle...

1306
01:36:53,875 --> 01:36:57,417
Inspite of the gift of vision,
we often misplace things and can't find them.

1307
01:36:57,625 --> 01:36:59,375
You both can't see.

1308
01:36:59,583 --> 01:37:02,708
But you know where to find
every single thing for your daughter.

1309
01:37:03,292 --> 01:37:05,125
It's so heartwarming.

1310
01:37:05,375 --> 01:37:06,708
We can't see;

1311
01:37:07,833 --> 01:37:09,042
But we know our daughter.

1312
01:37:10,792 --> 01:37:12,583
Bye, Aunty. Bye, Uncle.
- Okay.

1313
01:37:12,917 --> 01:37:14,250
We've told you already.

1314
01:37:14,375 --> 01:37:16,500
No matter how much you offer us,
we won't sell our house.

1315
01:37:16,583 --> 01:37:18,042
This is our ancestral property.
Go away!

1316
01:37:18,083 --> 01:37:18,708
Okay.

1317
01:37:19,250 --> 01:37:20,917
We've been after you for four months now.

1318
01:37:21,500 --> 01:37:22,750
Even your neighbours have signed it.

1319
01:37:23,250 --> 01:37:24,083
Only you haven't.

1320
01:37:24,417 --> 01:37:27,333
We've invested 10 billion in this building.
We need this space for parking lot.

1321
01:37:27,625 --> 01:37:28,208
Just give it to us.

1322
01:37:28,250 --> 01:37:29,250
Don't trouble us, please.

1323
01:37:29,833 --> 01:37:32,083
We will not sell our home.
God bless you.

1324
01:37:32,625 --> 01:37:34,292
Bless you. Goodbye!

1325
01:37:34,333 --> 01:37:37,208
I've tried using the legal methods;
Even tried using cops.

1326
01:37:37,333 --> 01:37:38,167
Next, only rowdyism.

1327
01:37:38,750 --> 01:37:41,250
I'm giving you a day's time.
Vacate the place.

1328
01:37:41,625 --> 01:37:43,708
I don't know what will happen next.

1329
01:37:50,375 --> 01:37:52,292
If they hire a thug, so will we.

1330
01:37:52,583 --> 01:37:54,875
This guy is the most terrifying
of all the thugs.

1331
01:37:55,083 --> 01:37:57,125
His name is Ganesh.
Vedalam Ganesh.

1332
01:37:57,208 --> 01:38:06,458
In the sweet Tamizh language;
With her smile, bright as the moon...

1333
01:38:07,500 --> 01:38:08,583
Token number 5!

1334
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:09,750
Coming.

1335
01:38:09,917 --> 01:38:10,500
Esther...

1336
01:38:10,958 --> 01:38:13,625
He's the man I admitted in the hospital!
- Problem solved, then.

1337
01:38:13,917 --> 01:38:15,167
You saved his life.

1338
01:38:15,458 --> 01:38:16,875
We'll use that to save your home.

1339
01:38:17,042 --> 01:38:18,500
That was a favour.

1340
01:38:18,708 --> 01:38:20,000
We shouldn't bring that up.

1341
01:38:20,375 --> 01:38:21,792
Let's just pay him money.

1342
01:38:22,125 --> 01:38:22,750
You think?

1343
01:38:23,500 --> 01:38:24,375
Okay, I'll talk to him.

1344
01:38:25,708 --> 01:38:26,542
Sir..

1345
01:38:30,583 --> 01:38:31,125
Tell me, kid.

1346
01:38:31,167 --> 01:38:35,458
We need a rowdy worse, more terrifying...

1347
01:38:35,542 --> 01:38:39,958
Inhumane, despicable and horrible
than our enemies.

1348
01:38:40,333 --> 01:38:41,875
So we came to you...

1349
01:38:41,917 --> 01:38:43,667
Inhumane, huh?

1350
01:38:44,250 --> 01:38:46,583
No! We wanted a respectable Mr. Rowdy.

1351
01:38:46,667 --> 01:38:48,500
You're respectful.
You shut up.

1352
01:38:48,958 --> 01:38:49,708
You tell me, Miss.

1353
01:38:49,750 --> 01:38:51,708
Actually, what happened was...

1354
01:39:08,875 --> 01:39:12,250
That's why we came to you, Mr. Rowdy.
- Small doubt. Are you really a rowdy?

1355
01:39:12,458 --> 01:39:14,208
You're so fair and pinkish!
- Rascal!

1356
01:39:14,583 --> 01:39:16,083
You think you can get away with it?

1357
01:39:16,417 --> 01:39:18,875
This guy goes "isku".
That guy goes "asku"

1358
01:39:19,042 --> 01:39:22,000
He keeps peeping out
and this one is brandishing weapons.

1359
01:39:22,542 --> 01:39:25,417
Either drink your tea or hit me.

1360
01:39:25,542 --> 01:39:27,500
Don't play your film in my theatre.

1361
01:39:27,583 --> 01:39:29,125
This wait is getting me annoyed.

1362
01:39:29,167 --> 01:39:31,750
Come on, come on!

1363
01:39:44,625 --> 01:39:45,250
Kid.

1364
01:39:45,958 --> 01:39:48,792
You said I was fair?
- Wanted to know your fare...

1365
01:39:50,417 --> 01:39:52,250
Little One, give them the menu.

1366
01:39:53,042 --> 01:39:55,208
We're not hungry.
We don't want food.

1367
01:39:55,250 --> 01:39:56,958
Funny girl. Funny girl.

1368
01:39:57,500 --> 01:40:00,000
This is not your food menu.
It's the fight menu.

1369
01:40:00,042 --> 01:40:00,708
Listen up!

1370
01:40:00,792 --> 01:40:02,458
5,000 for a body part;
10,000 to shape the body.

1371
01:40:02,458 --> 01:40:04,625
15 for house deals;
20 for total tango.

1372
01:40:04,667 --> 01:40:06,958
25,000 to make a guy disappear.
30,000 to hide loose pieces.

1373
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:08,125
50,000 to finish a group.

1374
01:40:08,167 --> 01:40:10,333
25 to shake up a team;
35 to shake up the group.

1375
01:40:10,375 --> 01:40:12,875
50 to do a solo man;
75 to do a group of men.

1376
01:40:12,917 --> 01:40:14,333
What will you have?
- House deal.

1377
01:40:14,375 --> 01:40:15,667
How much?
- Fifteen thousand.

1378
01:40:16,208 --> 01:40:17,167
Fifteen thousand?

1379
01:40:17,292 --> 01:40:18,417
I have only ten thousand, sir.

1380
01:40:18,458 --> 01:40:19,292
Don't you worry.

1381
01:40:19,500 --> 01:40:21,250
We have special rates for Ladies.

1382
01:40:21,292 --> 01:40:23,083
How does that work?

1383
01:40:26,875 --> 01:40:28,292
Oh my god!

1384
01:40:31,250 --> 01:40:31,917
Hello, Brother!

1385
01:40:33,292 --> 01:40:35,833
Vedalam is here. You better get going.
Go away!

1386
01:40:35,875 --> 01:40:37,583
This is the Mr.Rowdy I told you about.

1387
01:40:38,125 --> 01:40:40,583
Hello, Mr. Rowdy.
- Hello!

1388
01:40:41,375 --> 01:40:43,292
Mr. Rowdy, this is our home.

1389
01:40:43,542 --> 01:40:44,583
Nice.

1390
01:40:44,958 --> 01:40:47,750
This was our grandfather.
He built this home.

1391
01:40:48,500 --> 01:40:49,792
This home means the world to us.

1392
01:40:49,833 --> 01:40:50,792
Very nice.

1393
01:40:50,833 --> 01:40:52,000
Drink some coffee, son.

1394
01:40:55,375 --> 01:40:56,958
Very, very nice.

1395
01:40:58,500 --> 01:41:01,083
Let's go out, get some fresh air.

1396
01:41:01,792 --> 01:41:04,292
Come on, Dad.
And you, Big Miss.

1397
01:41:04,667 --> 01:41:06,000
Come on, Miss.

1398
01:41:06,583 --> 01:41:08,958
Little One, come soon!
- Okay, Boss.

1399
01:41:09,417 --> 01:41:11,917
Sir, tell me about these flowers.

1400
01:41:12,792 --> 01:41:13,875
Mr. Rowdy...

1401
01:41:14,083 --> 01:41:18,208
This rose has a botanical scientifc
name Rosa.

1402
01:41:18,250 --> 01:41:20,708
Botanical name? Oh.

1403
01:41:21,250 --> 01:41:24,042
And this button flower...
- What about it?

1404
01:41:25,708 --> 01:41:28,167
Vedalam is doing his thing now.

1405
01:41:28,208 --> 01:41:30,167
It doesn't have a fragrance;
But has a long life span.

1406
01:41:30,250 --> 01:41:31,125
Poor flower...

1407
01:41:31,208 --> 01:41:33,500
Jasmine, on the other hand...
- Yes?

1408
01:41:34,250 --> 01:41:36,333
...Is fragrant but has a short life.

1409
01:41:36,625 --> 01:41:37,458
Poor flower, indeed!

1410
01:41:37,500 --> 01:41:40,125
Flowers are our life;
Only a fool would refute.

1411
01:41:40,458 --> 01:41:41,833
What a fool!

1412
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,458
Without pain, there is no life.
- Sir?

1413
01:41:45,583 --> 01:41:46,583
Take this, sir.

1414
01:41:47,083 --> 01:41:48,208
Mr. Rowdy?
-Tell me, sir.

1415
01:41:48,542 --> 01:41:49,875
I knew in my heart...

1416
01:41:50,083 --> 01:41:52,750
You're doing this job for free
as a favour to us, right?

1417
01:41:52,792 --> 01:41:54,375
Funny guy, funny guy.

1418
01:41:54,583 --> 01:41:57,833
You gave me fifteen thousand.
But he paid five hundred thousand.

1419
01:41:58,125 --> 01:41:59,583
Which is greater?

1420
01:41:59,625 --> 01:42:00,458
You tell me.

1421
01:42:00,875 --> 01:42:04,458
The deal is still open.
Pay me a rupee over five hundred thousand...

1422
01:42:04,875 --> 01:42:06,000
I'll switch to your side.

1423
01:42:06,125 --> 01:42:08,208
You promised to help us
but you're taking their side.

1424
01:42:08,250 --> 01:42:09,000
What is this?

1425
01:42:09,417 --> 01:42:10,542
Pure betrayal.

1426
01:42:10,625 --> 01:42:11,875
This is not right, Mr. Rowdy.

1427
01:42:12,042 --> 01:42:13,667
It's wrong. Just wrong.

1428
01:42:13,750 --> 01:42:16,542
Little One, he's such a softie
even while scolding.

1429
01:42:16,667 --> 01:42:18,250
Funny guy, funny guy.

1430
01:42:21,625 --> 01:42:23,250
You're a college student.

1431
01:42:24,167 --> 01:42:26,000
Your mom and dad are old people.

1432
01:42:26,125 --> 01:42:31,125
Home, dome and such sentiments
won't work with me.

1433
01:42:31,792 --> 01:42:35,292
Sign the house over to the builder
and get lost.

1434
01:42:35,792 --> 01:42:37,500
Rich man, happy man.

1435
01:42:40,250 --> 01:42:41,333
Miss, I forgot to tell you.

1436
01:42:41,917 --> 01:42:43,958
Oh my god...
- God bless you.

1437
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:49,542
Your tender hands;
They haven't seen toil.

1438
01:42:49,583 --> 01:42:51,500
May I help you, dear?

1439
01:42:51,625 --> 01:42:57,208
Will you allow me?
Or are you wary...?

1440
01:42:57,583 --> 01:42:58,875
Little One, get me water.

1441
01:43:02,500 --> 01:43:03,083
Here, Boss.

1442
01:43:03,125 --> 01:43:05,083
You just gave me!
- I didn't.

1443
01:43:05,208 --> 01:43:05,917
I just got it.

1444
01:43:05,958 --> 01:43:07,500
You had bangles in your arm
and you came here...

1445
01:43:07,917 --> 01:43:09,208
What the hell?

1446
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:10,875
Who is in my house?

1447
01:43:13,750 --> 01:43:15,125
It's getting hot in here!

1448
01:43:15,500 --> 01:43:16,625
Turn on the fan.

1449
01:43:17,417 --> 01:43:19,167
I didn't even turn it on!

1450
01:43:19,208 --> 01:43:20,625
There's is some spirit in here!

1451
01:43:20,917 --> 01:43:23,167
This is my house.
I will kill you!

1452
01:43:23,208 --> 01:43:24,750
Spirits can't be killed.

1453
01:43:24,833 --> 01:43:26,917
They become spirits after getting killed.

1454
01:43:27,958 --> 01:43:31,417
Vedalam, I'll go get our groceries.

1455
01:43:31,458 --> 01:43:32,583
Little One...

1456
01:43:33,375 --> 01:43:34,417
Don't go alone.

1457
01:43:34,875 --> 01:43:35,958
You'll get scared.

1458
01:43:36,667 --> 01:43:37,708
I'll go with you.

1459
01:43:42,333 --> 01:43:45,708
That family has committed suicide
and come here as spirits to haunt us.

1460
01:43:45,917 --> 01:43:47,500
Spirits don't eat bananas.

1461
01:43:47,708 --> 01:43:49,292
Family, what are you doing here?

1462
01:43:49,375 --> 01:43:51,375
You locked us out of our home.

1463
01:43:51,417 --> 01:43:53,208
We didn't have a choice.
So we came here.

1464
01:43:53,250 --> 01:43:56,042
We'll leave if you return our key.
- Yeah, right.

1465
01:43:57,083 --> 01:43:59,250
Leave my house. Just leave my house!

1466
01:43:59,292 --> 01:44:00,708
Get out of here.

1467
01:44:01,583 --> 01:44:04,625
You... Trying to scare me, huh?

1468
01:44:08,500 --> 01:44:13,208
Little One, we're breaking all these things.
But they're laughing?

1469
01:44:13,500 --> 01:44:14,750
You're breaking your own things.

1470
01:44:15,500 --> 01:44:18,833
Switched to "vacate" mode, huh?

1471
01:44:19,042 --> 01:44:19,792
Mr. Rowdy...

1472
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:24,958
If you chuck us out of your home,
we'll kill ourselves at your doorstep.

1473
01:44:25,375 --> 01:44:26,583
And haunt you as spirits.

1474
01:44:26,792 --> 01:44:27,917
We don't have a choice.

1475
01:44:28,750 --> 01:44:30,500
Giving me a candy, huh?
I'll kill you.

1476
01:44:30,667 --> 01:44:32,958
Spirits are the hardest to evict, Vedalam!

1477
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:35,167
Wait till daybreak.
I'll handle it.

1478
01:44:35,208 --> 01:44:36,875
Go away!
- I'll shoot you.

1479
01:44:53,708 --> 01:44:54,500
Lock them up!

1480
01:44:55,125 --> 01:44:55,750
Hello?

1481
01:44:55,958 --> 01:44:58,625
Sir, we've got the girls from Kolkata
and North India.

1482
01:44:58,750 --> 01:45:02,875
We can ship the container as per plan
if we get the girls from Tamil Nadu.

1483
01:45:03,208 --> 01:45:04,833
That's fine. Cool.

1484
01:45:30,083 --> 01:45:30,917
Mr. Rowdy!

1485
01:45:37,167 --> 01:45:38,000
It's blessed.

1486
01:45:38,583 --> 01:45:39,333
Sweets, huh?

1487
01:45:40,167 --> 01:45:41,417
I'll give you one.
- Okay.

1488
01:45:41,833 --> 01:45:44,250
There's a big prayer session tomorrow.

1489
01:45:44,333 --> 01:45:47,750
Lady in green, bring your daughter along.
- Okay, Little One.

1490
01:45:47,792 --> 01:45:50,875
You've barged into my house,
what do you think you're doing?

1491
01:45:51,125 --> 01:45:52,375
Please, sir!
- I'll shoot you.

1492
01:45:53,125 --> 01:45:54,958
Why is he so angry?
- I'll burn you alive.

1493
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:57,583
Sir, please!
- Girl, don't touch me.

1494
01:45:57,667 --> 01:45:59,208
I said, don't touch me!
- Please, sir.

1495
01:46:04,250 --> 01:46:08,250
TN 10 4287. My gun is in the
mini van carrying a load of fish...

1496
01:46:08,792 --> 01:46:10,958
I want that gun back in ten minutes.

1497
01:46:11,333 --> 01:46:13,375
Or even I don't know
the consequences.

1498
01:46:13,458 --> 01:46:15,958
If even you don't know,
who would? Let it go.

1499
01:46:16,750 --> 01:46:17,958
Dad!
We're sorry, sir.

1500
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,042
Tamizh, make sure Mr. Rowdy
doesn't lose his cool.

1501
01:46:20,125 --> 01:46:22,167
42 87... mini van.

1502
01:46:22,292 --> 01:46:23,250
Carrying a load of fish...

1503
01:46:23,375 --> 01:46:24,500
Carrying a load of fish...

1504
01:46:24,583 --> 01:46:25,667
Mini van...

1505
01:46:26,417 --> 01:46:27,417
Found it!

1506
01:46:27,583 --> 01:46:28,958
Mr. Rowdy, found it!

1507
01:46:29,292 --> 01:46:31,708
I went after the mini van...
- You did.

1508
01:46:31,750 --> 01:46:33,458
And it just sped away!
- What?

1509
01:46:33,500 --> 01:46:34,625
Don't get mad, Mr. Rowdy.

1510
01:46:34,750 --> 01:46:35,958
You only lost one gun.

1511
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:37,917
I've bought you two guns.

1512
01:46:38,375 --> 01:46:38,958
Vedalam...

1513
01:46:39,333 --> 01:46:40,917
I've been with you for so many years.

1514
01:46:41,333 --> 01:46:43,292
I don't have a gun to call my own.

1515
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:45,458
He's got two guns.

1516
01:46:45,708 --> 01:46:47,333
One for you, one for me.

1517
01:46:47,958 --> 01:46:49,500
You should live here forever.

1518
01:46:49,625 --> 01:46:50,417
Here!

1519
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:55,042
Here, Mr. Rowdy.

1520
01:46:56,958 --> 01:46:58,542
They're toy guns.

1521
01:47:00,167 --> 01:47:02,125
Roll caps if you want to fire continuously.

1522
01:47:02,375 --> 01:47:04,250
Dotted caps if you will fire
now and then.

1523
01:47:04,833 --> 01:47:06,083
Your call, Mr. Rowdy.

1524
01:47:06,292 --> 01:47:08,917
Dad is a naive guy.
Let him go, Mr. Rowdy.

1525
01:47:09,208 --> 01:47:10,000
You!

1526
01:47:11,250 --> 01:47:12,583
You woke up early!

1527
01:47:12,958 --> 01:47:15,375
Still not eaten anything?
Here, take this sacrement.

1528
01:47:15,500 --> 01:47:17,333
Gomathi, is it Jaggery rice?
- Yes.

1529
01:47:17,500 --> 01:47:19,458
Eat it while it's still warm.

1530
01:47:25,250 --> 01:47:27,917
Three people have barged into
Vedalam's house?

1531
01:47:28,458 --> 01:47:29,542
Unbelievable.

1532
01:47:29,750 --> 01:47:31,417
Of course! It's a medical miracle.

1533
01:47:31,792 --> 01:47:32,708
What happened?

1534
01:47:34,167 --> 01:47:37,917
Had they brough a knife to fight,
I'd have stabbed them to death.

1535
01:47:38,417 --> 01:47:42,958
Had they brought a club,
I'd have clubbed them to death.

1536
01:47:43,458 --> 01:47:46,292
But they're doing something else.

1537
01:47:46,667 --> 01:47:49,250
I just don't know what.

1538
01:47:49,958 --> 01:47:53,125
We don't have the kind of weapons
to counter-attack their moves.

1539
01:47:53,167 --> 01:47:55,833
But they're upto something!

1540
01:47:58,208 --> 01:48:02,125
Everytime I see them,
I can feel something inside me.

1541
01:48:03,667 --> 01:48:06,958
I've never faced such feelings
my whole life.

1542
01:48:08,042 --> 01:48:09,542
Something wrong. Something wrong.

1543
01:48:09,833 --> 01:48:10,708
Don't worry, Vedalam.

1544
01:48:10,792 --> 01:48:13,583
We'll do those three
and vacate your house.

1545
01:48:13,708 --> 01:48:15,625
We'd do that for you!

1546
01:48:15,708 --> 01:48:17,250
Yes!
Just name the price.

1547
01:48:17,333 --> 01:48:18,000
Price?

1548
01:48:18,083 --> 01:48:19,875
You're insulting our boys.

1549
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:25,250
We were raised by you;
You taught us the ABC of violence.

1550
01:48:25,500 --> 01:48:26,958
I was just "Bland" Ravi.

1551
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:31,833
You ran a blade through my forehead,
and gave birth to "Blade" Ravi.

1552
01:48:32,083 --> 01:48:33,917
We'll do them. We will.

1553
01:48:34,417 --> 01:48:36,167
I was just Sudha.

1554
01:48:36,417 --> 01:48:39,708
You hit me on the head with a jug
and made me "Jughead" Sudha.

1555
01:48:39,875 --> 01:48:40,625
We'll do them.

1556
01:48:40,833 --> 01:48:43,250
For you, we'll do all three of them.

1557
01:48:44,125 --> 01:48:45,042
Punch your face!

1558
01:48:45,292 --> 01:48:49,167
I don't need freebies.
Do it for money.

1559
01:48:50,625 --> 01:48:51,208
Get lost.

1560
01:48:51,417 --> 01:48:52,375
Okay, Vedalam.

1561
01:48:52,417 --> 01:48:55,083
Keep munching on a samosa
and drink a glass of tea.

1562
01:48:55,125 --> 01:48:57,708
We'll get them out of your hair by then.

1563
01:48:57,750 --> 01:49:01,333
Don't bother ordering another samosa.
Won't take that long.

1564
01:49:02,292 --> 01:49:04,833
Vedalam, they are out of samosas
in this shop.

1565
01:49:05,250 --> 01:49:06,708
Shall I buy more from the next shop?

1566
01:49:06,875 --> 01:49:08,875
The boys have been gone for a while.

1567
01:49:10,542 --> 01:49:11,333
Let's check it out.

1568
01:49:16,167 --> 01:49:18,167
Brother, hold the mic higher.

1569
01:49:19,875 --> 01:49:25,167
Sis, I've been holding this pose
for so long, it hurts!

1570
01:49:25,292 --> 01:49:28,625
Salt Mahesh brother, just keep pouting
for a little while longer?

1571
01:49:31,292 --> 01:49:33,417
Sis, don't I look like a singer?

1572
01:49:34,167 --> 01:49:35,917
Yes, a classical singer!
- Thanks.

1573
01:49:36,333 --> 01:49:37,667
Singer, my foot.

1574
01:49:39,167 --> 01:49:41,958
Soda Sampath brother!
That's a guitar, not a hammer.

1575
01:49:42,167 --> 01:49:43,542
Strike a stylish pose.

1576
01:49:44,750 --> 01:49:45,667
Something else.

1577
01:49:46,417 --> 01:49:47,042
Nope.

1578
01:49:47,375 --> 01:49:47,917
Next!

1579
01:49:48,417 --> 01:49:50,000
It's superb. You're rocking it.

1580
01:49:50,042 --> 01:49:51,875
You flatter me. I'm blushing.

1581
01:49:54,792 --> 01:49:58,250
Some more veggies?
Eat up, son.

1582
01:49:58,458 --> 01:50:01,500
Even my birth mother has never
cooked this way for me.

1583
01:50:02,292 --> 01:50:03,208
Buzz off.

1584
01:50:03,958 --> 01:50:09,333
She just keeps the food coming, Vedalam.

1585
01:50:09,708 --> 01:50:11,292
Are you full?

1586
01:50:12,708 --> 01:50:16,875
If you start sweating from the spicy gravy,
the man in white fans you!

1587
01:50:17,500 --> 01:50:18,542
They've done it.

1588
01:50:19,750 --> 01:50:21,125
They have done it!

1589
01:50:21,708 --> 01:50:24,458
They've got fat pieces of drumsticks
in the gravy, Vedalam!

1590
01:50:24,917 --> 01:50:25,708
Go eat.

1591
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:28,000
You screwed up, Jughead!

1592
01:50:28,542 --> 01:50:29,375
Call yourself a thug?

1593
01:50:29,417 --> 01:50:33,167
Which is prettier,
my face or the flower?

1594
01:50:33,375 --> 01:50:35,167
Don't be envious. Tell me.

1595
01:50:37,958 --> 01:50:39,000
Why is he glaring at me?

1596
01:50:39,417 --> 01:50:40,292
Gomathi Ma'am!

1597
01:50:40,375 --> 01:50:41,292
Soda Sampath?

1598
01:50:41,333 --> 01:50:44,375
You've got one daughter
and twenty sons now, Ma'am!

1599
01:50:44,375 --> 01:50:45,083
YEAH!

1600
01:50:45,292 --> 01:50:47,292
Good boys!
-Dad, Mr. Rowdy is here.

1601
01:50:48,542 --> 01:50:51,625
Come on, son.
Let's eat together.

1602
01:50:51,625 --> 01:50:52,917
Like a big, happy family.

1603
01:50:52,958 --> 01:50:55,292
Little One...
- Let's all eat, Vedalam?

1604
01:50:55,875 --> 01:50:57,542
A big, happy family...

1605
01:50:57,833 --> 01:51:00,583
One family, they say.

1606
01:51:00,917 --> 01:51:05,917
The only way to get rid of them
is by using them.

1607
01:51:06,208 --> 01:51:07,125
How, Vedalam?

1608
01:51:09,583 --> 01:51:10,208
Get down.

1609
01:51:11,792 --> 01:51:12,500
Turn around!

1610
01:51:14,042 --> 01:51:17,042
Sir, the container is ready to depart
with the hundred girls.

1611
01:51:32,708 --> 01:51:33,833
All okay, Brother?

1612
01:51:34,042 --> 01:51:37,125
As per our plan, the container
with girls is ready to go.

1613
01:51:37,792 --> 01:51:38,750
Everything is okay?

1614
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:43,583
Don't worry, brother.
Our shipments will sail at the same time.

1615
01:51:43,667 --> 01:51:44,917
There should be no mistake.

1616
01:51:59,083 --> 01:52:02,208
Sir, one of the hundred girls
has committed suicide in the container.

1617
01:52:05,417 --> 01:52:08,792
As promised to my brother,
within one hour...

1618
01:52:09,125 --> 01:52:12,333
The container must depart with a hundred girls.

1619
01:52:12,417 --> 01:52:14,208
I want one hundred girls!

1620
01:52:29,333 --> 01:52:29,917
Sir...

1621
01:52:30,833 --> 01:52:33,667
We're raising funds for orphan girls.
- Really?

1622
01:52:33,750 --> 01:52:35,375
Do your bit...
- For orphans?

1623
01:52:35,542 --> 01:52:39,708
It's for little children.
We've been collecting all day.

1624
01:52:39,833 --> 01:52:40,542
Vedalam...

1625
01:52:40,667 --> 01:52:43,042
I told you she's at the beach.
Come soon.

1626
01:52:43,208 --> 01:52:45,792
I'm stuck in traffic. I'll be there.
Wait.

1627
01:52:45,917 --> 01:52:46,583
Come soon!

1628
01:52:46,667 --> 01:52:48,542
My wallet is in the car. Come with me.
- Okay, sir.

1629
01:52:48,750 --> 01:52:49,917
Carry on. I'll join you.

1630
01:52:53,708 --> 01:52:54,667
Get in!

1631
01:53:00,708 --> 01:53:01,792
Sit down.

1632
01:53:02,417 --> 01:53:04,167
Shut up. Sit!

1633
01:53:19,417 --> 01:53:20,625
Lift the container!

1634
01:53:23,708 --> 01:53:24,583
Lift it.

1635
01:53:26,083 --> 01:53:27,083
Lift it.

1636
01:53:50,167 --> 01:53:51,833
Who are you?
- I'm Vedalam, mate.

1637
01:53:52,750 --> 01:53:53,958
I'll get straight to the point.

1638
01:53:54,292 --> 01:53:57,917
I went to threaten a girl
first thing this morning.

1639
01:53:58,333 --> 01:54:01,833
Suddenly, a guy reversed his car
and hit my bike.

1640
01:54:02,333 --> 01:54:04,125
My bike's silencer popped out.

1641
01:54:04,542 --> 01:54:08,167
I yelled out to him
to pay for my broken silencer.

1642
01:54:08,375 --> 01:54:09,917
He just sped away.

1643
01:54:10,292 --> 01:54:12,917
And I was pissed off,
kept chasing after him.

1644
01:54:13,208 --> 01:54:17,000
And here, it turns out that you're all
a bunch of criminals.

1645
01:54:17,542 --> 01:54:19,333
But that's none of my business.

1646
01:54:19,417 --> 01:54:22,417
Just pay for my bike's repair charges.

1647
01:54:22,625 --> 01:54:23,750
I'll be on my way.

1648
01:54:23,917 --> 01:54:26,333
We don't need this right now.

1649
01:54:26,417 --> 01:54:29,417
Add extra 5 grand and pay him 25.
He'll be gone.

1650
01:54:29,667 --> 01:54:32,042
Every man is slave to money.

1651
01:54:32,292 --> 01:54:33,333
Human...

1652
01:54:45,375 --> 01:54:51,125
You're right! He grabbed it
like a dog would grab a bone.

1653
01:54:53,833 --> 01:54:54,708
Mates...

1654
01:54:54,958 --> 01:54:57,500
You understand the nature of money, alright.

1655
01:54:57,792 --> 01:55:00,208
But not my nature!

1656
01:55:01,708 --> 01:55:04,083
I'll do anything for money.

1657
01:55:04,542 --> 01:55:07,042
For my self respect...

1658
01:55:07,792 --> 01:55:09,250
I'd lay down my head.

1659
01:55:12,167 --> 01:55:15,083
We're a group of twenty.
You're just one guy.

1660
01:55:15,250 --> 01:55:16,917
You need a plan to attack.

1661
01:55:17,375 --> 01:55:19,167
Funny guy, funny guy.

1662
01:55:19,583 --> 01:55:21,667
My plan is to attack.

1663
01:57:35,458 --> 01:57:36,875
A girl has come to see me.

1664
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:38,958
You and your brothers...

1665
01:57:39,125 --> 01:57:43,000
She's got videos
incriminating your illegal activities.

1666
01:57:44,917 --> 01:57:48,333
Such young girls...
So many girls.

1667
01:57:49,292 --> 01:57:51,083
It's terrible, sir!
- Sit down, Miss.

1668
01:57:51,833 --> 01:57:54,708
Don't let them go, sir.
I've got videos.

1669
01:57:54,958 --> 01:57:57,000
Be seated.
- Don't let them go!

1670
01:57:58,667 --> 01:58:02,417
I've got the girl's name, address
and family details.

1671
01:58:02,875 --> 01:58:04,208
I've asked her to wait here.

1672
01:58:04,417 --> 01:58:07,542
There are so many good officers.
Why did you come to this man, Miss?

1673
01:58:07,708 --> 01:58:09,333
They'll kill you.
Flee, Miss.

1674
01:58:09,542 --> 01:58:11,417
Constable?
- Sir?

1675
01:58:11,917 --> 01:58:12,417
Yes, sir.

1676
01:58:12,458 --> 01:58:14,625
You'll come here?
Or shall I bring her over?

1677
01:58:16,083 --> 01:58:17,208
I'll take care...

1678
01:58:21,875 --> 01:58:22,708
Little One...

1679
01:58:22,833 --> 01:58:26,417
This is getting too sentimental.
I can't handle it.

1680
01:58:27,125 --> 01:58:30,375
It feels weird.
Send them away.

1681
01:58:30,500 --> 01:58:31,375
Send them away!

1682
01:58:31,542 --> 01:58:32,708
Ask them to leave.

1683
01:58:33,375 --> 01:58:34,333
Son...

1684
01:58:34,625 --> 01:58:36,500
God knows who you are!

1685
01:58:37,708 --> 01:58:40,417
I swear upon my womb;

1686
01:58:41,125 --> 01:58:42,917
If there is such a thing as God...

1687
01:58:43,750 --> 01:58:45,500
If there is any justice in this world.

1688
01:58:45,917 --> 01:58:47,625
No harm shall befall you.

1689
01:58:49,042 --> 01:58:52,292
You shall prosper, son!

1690
01:58:52,333 --> 01:58:54,833
By protecting your things,
you can protect your assets.

1691
01:58:55,292 --> 01:58:57,833
By saving a life,
you save the future.

1692
01:58:58,833 --> 01:59:02,250
But saving the girl,
means saving a family's lineage!

1693
01:59:03,333 --> 01:59:05,708
Don't know if you meant to do this.

1694
01:59:06,167 --> 01:59:11,292
But all your sins, from past, present and future
shall be washed away!

1695
01:59:12,167 --> 01:59:13,083
Sir...

1696
01:59:13,417 --> 01:59:16,292
How will we ever repay this favour, sir?

1697
01:59:16,792 --> 01:59:17,750
How will we?

1698
01:59:17,958 --> 01:59:19,667
Let's leave his house.

1699
01:59:21,292 --> 01:59:22,042
Alright.

1700
01:59:22,792 --> 01:59:26,833
We have troubled him a lot.
Let's go away.

1701
01:59:27,125 --> 01:59:28,292
Are you happy, Mr. Rowdy?

1702
01:59:34,292 --> 01:59:35,667
Why are you sitting here, Dad?

1703
01:59:35,708 --> 01:59:38,458
Tamizh, we've decided to leave
Mr. Rowdy's house.

1704
01:59:38,542 --> 01:59:40,667
Yes. Let's get out of here.

1705
01:59:43,875 --> 01:59:46,042
Where do we go with a young girl
at this hour?

1706
01:59:50,333 --> 01:59:50,875
Tamizh!

1707
01:59:52,458 --> 01:59:54,542
Tamizh, what happened?

1708
01:59:55,750 --> 01:59:57,917
Let's go, Dad.
- What happened?

1709
01:59:58,125 --> 02:00:00,417
Where are you taking us?
- Who is chasing us?

1710
02:00:00,458 --> 02:00:02,125
Why are they chasing us?

1711
02:00:02,375 --> 02:00:05,167
Just hide here, Dad.
- Why should we hide?

1712
02:00:05,458 --> 02:00:06,667
Tamizh, what...

1713
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:09,083
Just be quiet, Dad.
- I am scared.

1714
02:00:09,125 --> 02:00:11,208
Mom, please be quiet.
Stay here.

1715
02:00:11,250 --> 02:00:13,042
Don't step out.

1716
02:00:18,667 --> 02:00:19,375
Tamizh!

1717
02:00:21,083 --> 02:00:21,875
Mom!

1718
02:00:22,708 --> 02:00:23,417
Tamizh!

1719
02:00:24,083 --> 02:00:24,875
Tamizh?

1720
02:00:32,042 --> 02:00:33,125
Oh no! Tamizh?

1721
02:00:33,458 --> 02:00:34,333
Are you okay?

1722
02:00:34,542 --> 02:00:35,583
What has happened?

1723
02:00:35,667 --> 02:00:36,375
Dad!

1724
02:00:37,625 --> 02:00:39,083
What is it?

1725
02:00:39,375 --> 02:00:40,042
Tamizh.

1726
02:00:40,542 --> 02:00:42,542
Where are you?
- Tamizh!

1727
02:00:43,042 --> 02:00:43,750
Dad!

1728
02:00:44,375 --> 02:00:45,125
Tamizh.

1729
02:00:45,542 --> 02:00:48,708
Dad!
- Where are you, Tamizh?

1730
02:00:53,833 --> 02:00:56,042
Dad!
- Is she okay?

1731
02:00:56,083 --> 02:00:59,417
Tamizh, what's happening?

1732
02:01:03,792 --> 02:01:04,875
Mom!

1733
02:01:09,083 --> 02:01:10,333
Gomathi!

1734
02:01:14,083 --> 02:01:15,208
Dad!

1735
02:01:45,125 --> 02:01:47,292
Sir! Sir!
- Who is it?

1736
02:01:48,333 --> 02:01:49,958
Mr. Rowdy...

1737
02:01:50,333 --> 02:01:51,750
They stabbed us.
-Who?

1738
02:01:52,667 --> 02:01:55,125
Don't know who did it.

1739
02:01:55,417 --> 02:01:56,000
Sir...

1740
02:01:56,167 --> 02:01:57,875
Please check on my wife.

1741
02:01:57,958 --> 02:02:00,167
Please check if she is alive!

1742
02:02:00,292 --> 02:02:01,250
My wife...

1743
02:02:01,292 --> 02:02:03,375
Is she alive?

1744
02:02:04,667 --> 02:02:05,750
Gomathi!

1745
02:02:06,625 --> 02:02:08,542
My Gomathi...

1746
02:02:09,083 --> 02:02:10,333
My wife...

1747
02:02:10,667 --> 02:02:12,417
Gomathi... where are you?

1748
02:02:14,750 --> 02:02:15,583
Mister...

1749
02:02:16,458 --> 02:02:17,208
Mister!

1750
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:19,000
Mr. Rowdy!

1751
02:02:20,083 --> 02:02:22,375
Mr. Rowdy...
- Sir?

1752
02:02:24,375 --> 02:02:27,000
Mr. Rowdy, is my wife alive?

1753
02:02:27,125 --> 02:02:28,375
Is my wife alive?

1754
02:02:28,500 --> 02:02:30,167
Mister... Please!

1755
02:02:32,833 --> 02:02:33,833
Is she gone?

1756
02:02:36,417 --> 02:02:40,292
She would always say she wanted to die
at least a minute before me.

1757
02:02:42,917 --> 02:02:44,250
My wife...

1758
02:02:47,333 --> 02:02:49,208
Mister... my daughter...

1759
02:02:49,375 --> 02:02:51,292
My daughter Tamizh...
See if she's alive!

1760
02:02:51,375 --> 02:02:55,542
Look for my daughter, Tamizh.
Look around for her.

1761
02:02:56,583 --> 02:02:59,792
My baby...
she was a mother to us.

1762
02:03:03,542 --> 02:03:08,417
Save my daughter somehow...
Please protect my daughter from them!

1763
02:03:12,542 --> 02:03:15,708
You only work for money.

1764
02:03:18,958 --> 02:03:20,583
Money...

1765
02:03:21,625 --> 02:03:22,417
Money...

1766
02:03:23,500 --> 02:03:24,375
I have money.

1767
02:03:25,375 --> 02:03:28,083
Mr. Rowdy, save my daughter somehow.

1768
02:03:28,625 --> 02:03:30,500
Save my Tamizh somehow.

1769
02:03:30,542 --> 02:03:32,917
Save my daughter Tamizh.
Please...

1770
02:04:23,667 --> 02:04:26,833
We need to perform an operation.
Sign this consent form.

1771
02:04:27,542 --> 02:04:29,292
How are you related to the patient?

1772
02:04:32,583 --> 02:04:33,667
She's his sister.

1773
02:04:33,792 --> 02:04:38,625
When he was fighting for life the other day,
she admitted him here.

1774
02:04:42,458 --> 02:04:43,667
He's my brother...

1775
02:04:44,042 --> 02:04:44,833
My brother!

1776
02:04:45,167 --> 02:04:46,375
He's my brother...

1777
02:04:46,583 --> 02:04:50,083
She says he's her brother.
Admit him, quick.

1778
02:04:50,417 --> 02:04:51,500
Inform the doctor.

1779
02:04:52,542 --> 02:04:53,500
Sign here, sir.

1780
02:04:54,375 --> 02:04:55,292
Sign here!

1781
02:05:11,167 --> 02:05:11,958
Uncle.

1782
02:05:13,458 --> 02:05:14,917
Are you hurt?

1783
02:05:15,333 --> 02:05:17,083
Are you in pain?

1784
02:05:18,250 --> 02:05:19,542
Don't cry.

1785
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:22,708
Wipe your tears, uncle.
Please!

1786
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:28,208
A cloud floating above;
Showers me with love. I'm wilting away

1787
02:05:28,583 --> 02:05:33,625
Her loving gaze;
Lights up my life. I'm losing myself.

1788
02:05:33,750 --> 02:05:41,250
Incessantly, this heart beats for her.

1789
02:05:45,042 --> 02:05:52,833
My path is strewn,
With flowers in bloom.

1790
02:05:56,875 --> 02:06:02,417
Don't you break down; Don't shatter.
Beat on, Mighty Heart!

1791
02:06:02,583 --> 02:06:06,875
Tears may flood your vision;
But don't get washed away.

1792
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:09,375
You're patient Tamizh's older brother?

1793
02:06:09,458 --> 02:06:11,875
Don't worry.
She is out of danger.

1794
02:06:11,958 --> 02:06:15,917
But her body and mind
are in a state of shock.

1795
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:20,958
Her brain is affected from the injury.
It's too soon to tell how badly.

1796
02:06:21,167 --> 02:06:23,167
Anyway, let's hope for the best.

1797
02:06:23,250 --> 02:06:28,625
Don't you break down; Don't shatter.
Beat on, Mighty Heart!

1798
02:06:28,833 --> 02:06:34,417
Tears may flood your vision;
But don't get washed away.

1799
02:06:34,500 --> 02:06:39,958
Don't lose it; Don't lose your way.
Stay on path; Don't  go astray.

1800
02:06:40,250 --> 02:06:45,792
There's a long walk down this road;
Who knows where it leads?

1801
02:06:47,167 --> 02:06:49,125
You called me?
- Don't worry.

1802
02:06:49,167 --> 02:06:50,208
Sit back, relax.

1803
02:06:50,292 --> 02:06:51,333
Tell me, sir.

1804
02:06:51,750 --> 02:06:54,708
She's out of the coma.
No threat to her life.

1805
02:06:55,167 --> 02:06:56,250
She will live her life.

1806
02:06:57,625 --> 02:07:00,375
But she's completely lost her memory.

1807
02:07:01,708 --> 02:07:03,250
She doesn't remember her past.

1808
02:07:04,417 --> 02:07:07,708
She doens't remember her mother, her father
or even herself.

1809
02:07:08,208 --> 02:07:11,000
Her past is what you choose to tell her now.

1810
02:07:11,500 --> 02:07:14,292
What to tell her, is your choice.

1811
02:07:17,500 --> 02:07:19,500
Doctor, the patient is out of control.

1812
02:07:20,167 --> 02:07:23,500
Be calm. We are here for you!

1813
02:07:23,958 --> 02:07:24,958
Don't be scared.

1814
02:07:25,583 --> 02:07:28,500
Who are they? I don't know.
- Try to remember.

1815
02:07:28,750 --> 02:07:30,833
Look closer.
- I don't know!

1816
02:07:31,375 --> 02:07:32,958
I'm scared!
- Just try.

1817
02:07:33,417 --> 02:07:35,083
Calm down.

1818
02:07:35,250 --> 02:07:37,542
I can't remember anything.

1819
02:07:38,292 --> 02:07:41,917
I'm scared. I'm so scared!

1820
02:07:50,375 --> 02:07:51,958
I know him!

1821
02:07:52,792 --> 02:07:54,042
I recognise him.

1822
02:07:54,542 --> 02:07:55,667
Who are you, sir?

1823
02:07:57,917 --> 02:07:59,708
Who are you to me?

1824
02:07:59,958 --> 02:08:00,875
Tell me?

1825
02:08:02,667 --> 02:08:04,167
Who are you to me?

1826
02:08:05,167 --> 02:08:06,292
Who are you, sir?

1827
02:08:06,833 --> 02:08:07,750
Please...

1828
02:08:08,667 --> 02:08:09,583
Tell me, sir.

1829
02:08:26,083 --> 02:08:27,833
Who are you to me?

1830
02:08:32,333 --> 02:08:33,333
I'm your brother.

1831
02:08:37,542 --> 02:08:38,417
Brother...

1832
02:08:44,333 --> 02:08:45,292
Brother!

1833
02:09:09,792 --> 02:09:13,833
My soul is stirring;
And my heart pounding.

1834
02:09:13,875 --> 02:09:15,333
Oh Lord!

1835
02:09:15,458 --> 02:09:19,542
Sparks of flame sear me;
My body is aflame.

1836
02:09:57,542 --> 02:09:59,042
Take care of her diet.

1837
02:09:59,500 --> 02:10:01,458
Bring her in for regular check ups.
- Okay, Doctor.

1838
02:10:08,292 --> 02:10:09,000
Hello?

1839
02:10:19,542 --> 02:10:20,833
Tamizh became my family.

1840
02:10:21,208 --> 02:10:22,125
My life.

1841
02:10:22,625 --> 02:10:24,375
Her happiness became my happiness.

1842
02:10:24,833 --> 02:10:26,500
Her sorrow became mine.

1843
02:10:26,875 --> 02:10:29,417
Her vengeance became mine.

1844
02:10:31,500 --> 02:10:33,875
I went after her enemies
one by men.

1845
02:10:35,042 --> 02:10:37,042
On the one hand,
I was burning for revenge.

1846
02:10:37,458 --> 02:10:39,625
On the other hand,
was my dearest sister.

1847
02:10:40,208 --> 02:10:45,958
I didn't want Tamizh to get caught
in the crossfire...

1848
02:10:46,583 --> 02:10:51,458
When I was worrying for her safety,
your brother asked to marry her.

1849
02:10:52,542 --> 02:10:54,083
I saw truth in his eyes.

1850
02:10:56,250 --> 02:11:00,375
Tamizh doesn't know
of her parents' murder or her tragic past.

1851
02:11:01,333 --> 02:11:02,667
She must never find out.

1852
02:11:03,958 --> 02:11:06,708
My sister has nothing to do
with these murders.

1853
02:11:06,917 --> 02:11:09,333
Don't destroy her life on my account.

1854
02:11:10,792 --> 02:11:12,292
Don't stop the wedding.

1855
02:11:12,875 --> 02:11:17,833
A bond forged out of love
is as strong as a bond forged by blood.

1856
02:11:18,625 --> 02:11:19,458
Don't worry.

1857
02:11:19,917 --> 02:11:23,333
By your good will,
Tamizh will have a happy marriage.

1858
02:11:45,375 --> 02:11:47,958
Only one person survives
the attack over your brothers.

1859
02:11:48,500 --> 02:11:50,167
He must have seen the killer.

1860
02:11:52,292 --> 02:11:53,458
His condition is very critical.

1861
02:11:53,500 --> 02:11:54,417
He is unconscious.

1862
02:11:54,625 --> 02:11:56,500
His survival rate is only 7%.

1863
02:11:56,750 --> 02:11:58,625
We can't say anything
for another twenty four hours.

1864
02:11:59,042 --> 02:12:00,042
He must live.

1865
02:12:00,500 --> 02:12:03,542
He has witnessed a man.
I want details on him.

1866
02:12:04,792 --> 02:12:06,792
This is a matter of two lives.

1867
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:07,625
Sir?

1868
02:12:07,958 --> 02:12:10,458
His life.
And yours.

1869
02:12:12,667 --> 02:12:14,167
That's not how you do it.
I'll show you!

1870
02:12:14,250 --> 02:12:16,250
Show her what?
- Wait.

1871
02:12:16,708 --> 02:12:18,375
Her exams will be over in two days.

1872
02:12:18,958 --> 02:12:20,167
It's my sister's dream!

1873
02:12:20,208 --> 02:12:23,250
Come on, mom-in-law!
Take your sister to college.

1874
02:12:23,625 --> 02:12:24,333
Okay.

1875
02:12:27,667 --> 02:12:28,750
That's it.

1876
02:12:29,167 --> 02:12:29,917
That's it!

1877
02:12:29,958 --> 02:12:33,542
Keep that fire burning
in those berris you have for eyes...

1878
02:12:33,625 --> 02:12:41,417
Scream for help and say
"Oh no! Ganesh misbehaved with me"

1879
02:12:41,875 --> 02:12:43,250
His life is done.

1880
02:12:43,375 --> 02:12:45,083
The wedding will be off, too.

1881
02:12:45,208 --> 02:12:46,792
We will win!

1882
02:12:50,708 --> 02:12:52,500
This wasn't a part of our plan!

1883
02:12:52,542 --> 02:12:53,542
It's a part of my plan.

1884
02:12:53,625 --> 02:12:54,542
Awesome!

1885
02:12:54,750 --> 02:12:56,750
The scene will be stronger.

1886
02:12:57,708 --> 02:12:59,708
Now, it'll be double strong!

1887
02:12:59,875 --> 02:13:01,458
Help me!

1888
02:13:01,500 --> 02:13:03,292
He's dishonouring me.

1889
02:13:03,333 --> 02:13:04,292
Who?

1890
02:13:04,375 --> 02:13:05,875
He's raping me!

1891
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:07,917
He's violating me.

1892
02:13:07,958 --> 02:13:09,708
It's all the same thing, fool.

1893
02:13:10,875 --> 02:13:12,625
Oh no!

1894
02:13:12,833 --> 02:13:14,458
You lustful monster!

1895
02:13:14,542 --> 02:13:16,083
You sleazebag...

1896
02:13:16,125 --> 02:13:20,667
You ripped out my daughter's heart.
And now you're ripping this girl's blouse?

1897
02:13:20,917 --> 02:13:22,042
She did it to herself.

1898
02:13:23,167 --> 02:13:24,333
Mom-in-law!

1899
02:13:24,417 --> 02:13:25,750
This was not the plan.

1900
02:13:25,875 --> 02:13:26,583
Mom-in-law!

1901
02:13:29,292 --> 02:13:30,542
Mom-in-law...
-Get lost, you!

1902
02:13:31,083 --> 02:13:37,042
Just by reading her lips,
you can tell that she swore very badly.

1903
02:13:37,167 --> 02:13:41,417
These abusive words or ill-treatment
do not hurt me.

1904
02:13:41,750 --> 02:13:43,125
But why did you reverse attack?

1905
02:13:43,167 --> 02:13:44,542
I love Ganesh.

1906
02:13:47,250 --> 02:13:49,708
Swamy sir.
You like Swetha Ma'am, too?

1907
02:13:51,000 --> 02:13:54,208
I joined as her assistant in my middle age...

1908
02:13:54,250 --> 02:13:56,000
Not admiring her defence in the court.

1909
02:13:56,625 --> 02:13:59,250
But admiring her...
-Swamy sir!

1910
02:14:01,958 --> 02:14:03,750
He's crashing now.
Anything could happen.

1911
02:14:03,833 --> 02:14:05,417
Make him survive.
- Can't.

1912
02:14:05,500 --> 02:14:08,042
We cannot stabilise him.
- We can inject adromin to wake him up.

1913
02:14:08,125 --> 02:14:09,833
But he won't live for more than thirty minutes.

1914
02:14:10,083 --> 02:14:11,667
I only need him alive for thirty minutes.

1915
02:14:11,750 --> 02:14:14,208
Sketch out the details
of my brothers' murderer!

1916
02:14:14,250 --> 02:14:15,667
Get me a caricature artist.

1917
02:14:15,792 --> 02:14:18,167
It's hard to arrange for a forensic's
sketch specialist now.

1918
02:14:18,250 --> 02:14:20,500
We will do one thing.
There is an arts and painting college nearby.

1919
02:14:20,625 --> 02:14:23,083
The principal is a friend.
I will bring a student from there.

1920
02:14:23,125 --> 02:14:24,208
I'll go.
- Great!

1921
02:14:24,708 --> 02:14:26,125
I'll give him an injection right now.

1922
02:14:26,917 --> 02:14:28,417
Sir, don't misunderstand me.

1923
02:14:28,458 --> 02:14:30,542
There's an examination going on.
- Don't say that!

1924
02:14:30,625 --> 02:14:32,042
Please, it's urgent.

1925
02:14:33,250 --> 02:14:35,333
I need someone to sketch..
- It's not possible.

1926
02:14:35,417 --> 02:14:36,917
I'm sorry.
- I'm done with the exam, sir.

1927
02:14:38,417 --> 02:14:41,208
This is my wedding invitation.
Please do come, sir.

1928
02:14:41,375 --> 02:14:43,333
Congrats.
Tamizh, one minute.

1929
02:14:43,792 --> 02:14:46,333
This is my close friend.
He needs a favour.

1930
02:14:46,583 --> 02:14:50,042
He wants a forensic sketch done. Can you?
- Of course, sir.

1931
02:14:50,167 --> 02:14:52,250
I'll do it.
- Thank you very much.

1932
02:14:55,875 --> 02:14:56,625
Is this the one?

1933
02:15:09,250 --> 02:15:10,417
Tamizh, I'm at the college.

1934
02:15:10,458 --> 02:15:13,542
I'm at Crystal Hospital on work, brother.
- Hang up the phone!

1935
02:15:13,625 --> 02:15:15,958
Crystal Hospital?
- Can you pick me up?

1936
02:15:16,042 --> 02:15:16,792
I'll be there.

1937
02:15:16,833 --> 02:15:17,583
Sorry, sir.

1938
02:15:19,000 --> 02:15:19,625
This one?

1939
02:15:36,500 --> 02:15:37,833
Is this the man?

1940
02:15:39,375 --> 02:15:40,500
Did he kill my brothers?

1941
02:15:41,375 --> 02:15:43,042
Is he the man who murdered my brothers?

1942
02:15:45,125 --> 02:15:46,625
Find this guy.
- I made a mistake!

1943
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:51,417
While I was sketching,
I got a call from my brother.

1944
02:15:51,667 --> 02:15:54,208
So... I got confused and drew my brother's face.

1945
02:15:54,625 --> 02:15:55,417
Sorry, sir.

1946
02:15:57,000 --> 02:15:58,792
My brother doesn't get into trouble.

1947
02:15:59,708 --> 02:16:02,000
Ask him to tell me one more time.
I'll sketch again.

1948
02:16:02,583 --> 02:16:03,958
Brother?
- Yes, sir.

1949
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:05,375
Your brother?
- Yes.

1950
02:16:05,625 --> 02:16:06,167
Fine.

1951
02:16:06,375 --> 02:16:08,958
My brother would not do anything wrong.
- Yes.

1952
02:16:09,833 --> 02:16:10,667
Don't panic.

1953
02:16:11,667 --> 02:16:14,792
Where is your brother?
- He's coming to pick me up.

1954
02:16:14,833 --> 02:16:16,083
From here?
- Yes.

1955
02:16:16,250 --> 02:16:17,708
Now?
- Yes, sir.

1956
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:19,708
My brother is innocent.

1957
02:16:20,125 --> 02:16:21,125
Chillax.

1958
02:16:21,917 --> 02:16:23,542
I don't doubt you.

1959
02:16:23,958 --> 02:16:25,792
You look like a good girl.

1960
02:16:26,958 --> 02:16:29,458
Your brother looks very innocent, too.

1961
02:16:30,125 --> 02:16:31,792
I understand that you sketched it wrong.

1962
02:16:32,792 --> 02:16:34,417
Just relax.
Sit.

1963
02:16:35,625 --> 02:16:36,375
Sit!

1964
02:16:36,667 --> 02:16:38,917
Is your brother coming?
- He's coming, sir.

1965
02:16:39,875 --> 02:16:40,458
Call him.

1966
02:16:40,833 --> 02:16:42,083
Ask him to come get you.

1967
02:16:43,292 --> 02:16:44,542
Brother...
- I'm on my way.

1968
02:16:44,542 --> 02:16:47,417
I'm at Crystal Hospital. I'm scared.

1969
02:16:48,125 --> 02:16:53,333
Nature doesn't know good or bad.
Only conviction determines the end.

1970
02:16:53,708 --> 02:16:56,292
I yearn to kill my brothers' murderer.

1971
02:16:57,125 --> 02:16:58,208
My conviction...

1972
02:16:58,542 --> 02:17:02,917
It's so big,
nature has brought him to me.

1973
02:17:03,833 --> 02:17:05,958
He's coming, right?
- Yes, sir.

1974
02:17:42,875 --> 02:17:43,458
Let's go?

1975
02:17:46,333 --> 02:17:49,208
My brother did nothing!
I told you my sketch was wrong.

1976
02:17:49,250 --> 02:17:50,083
Sir, what is this?

1977
02:17:50,417 --> 02:17:53,083
Let my brother go.
- Let us go, sir!

1978
02:17:53,458 --> 02:17:55,333
Sir, I'm begging you.

1979
02:17:58,792 --> 02:18:00,500
Sir, let us go.
Please!

1980
02:18:08,125 --> 02:18:09,417
Let us go. We'll just leave.

1981
02:18:09,875 --> 02:18:12,542
Sir, they look innocent.
They're innocent.

1982
02:18:12,625 --> 02:18:14,167
They have nothing to do with this.

1983
02:18:14,292 --> 02:18:15,417
Please, sir. let them go.

1984
02:18:15,583 --> 02:18:16,292
Please, sir.

1985
02:18:28,167 --> 02:18:29,083
Let them go, sir.

1986
02:18:29,208 --> 02:18:31,250
You may go!
- Thanks a lot, sir.

1987
02:18:31,625 --> 02:18:32,917
Bless your family.

1988
02:18:33,583 --> 02:18:35,083
Bless your son!

1989
02:18:35,750 --> 02:18:36,875
Bless you, sir.

1990
02:18:37,417 --> 02:18:38,208
Let's go.

1991
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:39,625
Come on.

1992
02:19:04,917 --> 02:19:07,500
Forgive me, sir.
- He's holding your family?

1993
02:19:07,542 --> 02:19:09,083
Yes!
- You got scared?

1994
02:19:09,292 --> 02:19:12,917
He's shaken up an Indo-French Cartel leader
like you; dragged you down to Kolkata.

1995
02:19:13,000 --> 02:19:15,583
He's killed both your brothers.
Wouldn't he kill my son?

1996
02:19:15,667 --> 02:19:17,500
He must be feared.

1997
02:19:18,167 --> 02:19:20,417
Sir, you're sweating.

1998
02:19:26,375 --> 02:19:28,750
It was my fault.
- Don't worry, Tamizh.

1999
02:19:30,792 --> 02:19:33,208
This is something else.
- You'll be okay?

2000
02:19:33,375 --> 02:19:34,958
We have nothing to do with this.

2001
02:19:35,708 --> 02:19:37,000
You did well in the exams?

2002
02:19:37,792 --> 02:19:38,708
That's enough.

2003
02:19:39,042 --> 02:19:41,083
Hello, Swetha?
Where are you?

2004
02:19:44,625 --> 02:19:46,167
Hi!
- Welcome, welcome.

2005
02:19:47,708 --> 02:19:49,083
How are you?
- Hi.

2006
02:19:49,167 --> 02:19:51,833
I'll be right back.
Take care of Tamizh.

2007
02:19:53,708 --> 02:19:54,417
Ganesh.

2008
02:19:55,000 --> 02:19:56,458
Ganesh, what happened?

2009
02:19:56,583 --> 02:19:57,792
Rahul has reached Kolkata.

2010
02:19:58,042 --> 02:20:00,125
Don't know when or how he will attack.

2011
02:20:00,458 --> 02:20:01,750
Take care of sister.

2012
02:20:03,417 --> 02:20:03,958
Hello?

2013
02:20:04,042 --> 02:20:08,083
You took your sister away
right under my nose?

2014
02:20:08,792 --> 02:20:11,750
Now I'll snatch her
from under your nose. Watch.

2015
02:20:27,958 --> 02:20:28,708
Tamizh!

2016
02:20:31,208 --> 02:20:32,000
Where is Tamizh?

2017
02:20:32,708 --> 02:20:35,958
They said you called for her.
You're asking us?

2018
02:20:36,083 --> 02:20:38,875
You would just send her with a stranger, huh?
- What happened?

2019
02:20:39,458 --> 02:20:40,250
I called her.

2020
02:20:40,583 --> 02:20:42,292
She wanted to buy something
in the ground floor.

2021
02:20:42,750 --> 02:20:43,625
I'll get her.

2022
02:20:47,417 --> 02:20:48,708
Come on.

2023
02:20:49,167 --> 02:20:50,333
I'll tell you where.

2024
02:20:50,375 --> 02:20:52,875
What's happened to Tamizh, Ganesh?
- Tamizh won't be harmed.

2025
02:20:53,000 --> 02:20:53,917
I won't allow it.

2026
02:20:54,042 --> 02:20:56,625
I don't know if I will return.
But Tamizh will.

2027
02:20:56,750 --> 02:20:59,042
You will get her married to your brother.

2028
02:21:07,833 --> 02:21:09,042
Where is my sister?

2029
02:21:12,542 --> 02:21:13,542
Where is Tamizh?

2030
02:21:20,917 --> 02:21:22,292
Where is my sister?

2031
02:21:25,875 --> 02:21:26,875
Where is Tamizh?

2032
02:21:27,417 --> 02:21:29,458
Where is my sister?
-I killed her.

2033
02:21:37,625 --> 02:21:40,208
I just lied,
but it shook you up?

2034
02:21:40,542 --> 02:21:43,750
You killed my brothers
and threw them like garbage.

2035
02:21:43,917 --> 02:21:45,167
How would I feel?

2036
02:21:46,125 --> 02:21:48,500
You turned my man against me.

2037
02:21:48,875 --> 02:21:49,792
Deadly move.

2038
02:21:51,125 --> 02:21:54,708
Do you know who brought
your sister to me?

2039
02:21:59,208 --> 02:22:00,042
Tamizh?

2040
02:22:01,292 --> 02:22:02,167
Tamizh!

2041
02:22:03,417 --> 02:22:04,250
Tamizh!

2042
02:22:06,542 --> 02:22:07,417
Tamizh!

2043
02:22:09,250 --> 02:22:10,042
Let go.

2044
02:22:11,542 --> 02:22:12,417
Tamizh.

2045
02:22:14,083 --> 02:22:16,167
The one you ache to protect.

2046
02:22:16,333 --> 02:22:18,500
The one who made you wail in sorrow...

2047
02:22:18,958 --> 02:22:21,833
She was brought to me,
in a platter...

2048
02:22:21,875 --> 02:22:22,458
By YOU!

2049
02:22:23,583 --> 02:22:24,208
YOU.

2050
02:22:31,542 --> 02:22:35,458
Once the car carrying your sister
leaves the port...

2051
02:22:35,625 --> 02:22:40,167
Even I can't trace which nation
she is going to.

2052
02:22:40,292 --> 02:22:42,042
International skin trade!

2053
02:22:42,583 --> 02:22:45,417
Men who covet women;
Men with money...

2054
02:22:46,583 --> 02:22:50,292
They will take turns
to ruin your sister.

2055
02:22:51,208 --> 02:22:53,708
Why?
Because of you.

2056
02:22:55,125 --> 02:22:59,583
This truth will haunt you;
You will slit your own throat.

2057
02:23:00,167 --> 02:23:01,417
Till then, I'll let you live.

2058
02:23:08,917 --> 02:23:09,875
Let me go!

2059
02:24:01,208 --> 02:24:03,375
Hello?
-Brother?

2060
02:24:05,500 --> 02:24:06,167
Tamizh?

2061
02:24:06,833 --> 02:24:08,167
I'm scared, Brother.

2062
02:24:08,292 --> 02:24:09,208
Where are you now?

2063
02:24:10,083 --> 02:24:11,292
The car is speeding away.

2064
02:24:11,792 --> 02:24:13,792
I don't know where.
-Don't cry!

2065
02:24:15,083 --> 02:24:16,000
Don't cry!

2066
02:24:17,875 --> 02:24:18,750
Look outside and tell me.

2067
02:24:20,875 --> 02:24:22,375
What do you see?

2068
02:24:24,917 --> 02:24:27,292
Riverside Mall.
The car just crossed it.

2069
02:24:29,125 --> 02:24:30,500
What do you see now?

2070
02:24:32,208 --> 02:24:33,542
I can see the Hoobly Bridge, brother.

2071
02:24:34,375 --> 02:24:36,042
Come soon, brother.
Come soon!

2072
02:24:36,500 --> 02:24:38,000
I'm at the Hoobly Bridge.

2073
02:24:38,042 --> 02:24:40,000
I'm scared.
- Don't be scared!

2074
02:24:40,417 --> 02:24:41,625
Where are you, brother?

2075
02:24:41,667 --> 02:24:42,458
Don't cry, Tamizh.

2076
02:24:47,625 --> 02:24:48,917
I can see Eden Garden.

2077
02:24:49,875 --> 02:24:51,333
I am at Eden Garden, too.

2078
02:24:51,542 --> 02:24:54,083
Your brother is coming to get you.
- Come soon, brother.

2079
02:24:59,333 --> 02:24:59,958
Brother?

2080
02:25:01,000 --> 02:25:01,750
Tamizh?

2081
02:25:01,875 --> 02:25:03,917
Lots of of buses.
Babughat bus stand.

2082
02:25:05,125 --> 02:25:07,042
The car crossed the Esplanade Mosque.

2083
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:10,333
What do you see now?
- Looks like Shyam Garden.

2084
02:25:12,042 --> 02:25:13,125
Come soon, Brother.

2085
02:25:17,958 --> 02:25:19,500
The car is stopping at traffic jam.

2086
02:25:23,292 --> 02:25:25,333
They've started the car!
Come soon, brother.

2087
02:25:33,333 --> 02:25:35,750
What do you see now, Tamizh?
Tell me.

2088
02:25:37,667 --> 02:25:39,875
Look outside and tell me.
What do you see?

2089
02:25:41,333 --> 02:25:42,042
I see you.

2090
02:25:42,708 --> 02:25:43,958
I see you, brother!

2091
02:25:50,833 --> 02:25:51,500
Tamizh...

2092
02:25:52,958 --> 02:25:56,292
Do you see my palm
or the back of my hand?

2093
02:25:57,708 --> 02:25:59,542
I see your face, brother.

2094
02:26:07,417 --> 02:26:09,542
Tamizh, is there a box in the back?

2095
02:26:15,958 --> 02:26:17,167
Are there many wires?

2096
02:26:17,708 --> 02:26:18,333
Yes!

2097
02:26:18,792 --> 02:26:19,500
Cut them.

2098
02:26:20,583 --> 02:26:21,792
Cut the brake light wire.

2099
02:26:22,208 --> 02:26:22,792
Quick.

2100
02:26:23,833 --> 02:26:26,000
I can't.
- Cut it!

2101
02:26:27,083 --> 02:26:29,208
Before the signal changes, quick!

2102
02:26:30,125 --> 02:26:31,500
The signal is about to change, Tamizh.

2103
02:26:33,167 --> 02:26:34,917
I can't!
- Quick, Tamizh.

2104
02:26:35,083 --> 02:26:36,208
Cut the wire.

2105
02:26:36,917 --> 02:26:38,125
Cut the wire, Tamizh.

2106
02:26:41,458 --> 02:26:43,583
Tamizh, I see the car you are in.

2107
02:26:45,167 --> 02:26:46,333
I have seen it!

2108
02:26:48,042 --> 02:26:49,917
I'm coming to get you.
I'm coming, sister.

2109
02:26:53,500 --> 02:26:54,125
Brother!

2110
02:26:55,542 --> 02:26:56,125
Brother!

2111
02:27:05,583 --> 02:27:06,292
Brother?

2112
02:27:10,250 --> 02:27:13,667
When your sister's car crosses that road...

2113
02:27:14,875 --> 02:27:18,042
She will be a piece of meat.

2114
02:27:18,792 --> 02:27:19,708
Cry, won't you?

2115
02:27:20,250 --> 02:27:20,833
Brother!

2116
02:27:22,958 --> 02:27:23,875
Tamizh!

2117
02:27:27,208 --> 02:27:28,292
Cry.

2118
02:27:40,542 --> 02:27:41,917
She's gone.

2119
02:27:41,958 --> 02:27:42,750
Brother?

2120
02:30:45,792 --> 02:30:47,125
Sir, please don't!

2121
02:30:47,583 --> 02:30:48,458
Don't hit me.

2122
02:30:48,625 --> 02:30:49,958
Please don't hit me.

2123
02:30:50,542 --> 02:30:51,583
It hurts, sir.

2124
02:30:52,917 --> 02:30:54,125
Let me go, please!

2125
02:30:54,458 --> 02:30:55,292
It hurts!

2126
02:30:55,917 --> 02:30:57,458
Brother!
- Let us go, please.

2127
02:30:57,875 --> 02:30:59,167
Don't hit my brother.

2128
02:30:59,958 --> 02:31:01,042
Don't hit me, sir.

2129
02:31:01,167 --> 02:31:01,875
Brother!

2130
02:31:02,708 --> 02:31:08,375
More than your blows...
This act of yours hurts terribly!

2131
02:31:10,167 --> 02:31:12,167
No! Don't hit my brother.

2132
02:31:13,542 --> 02:31:14,250
Brother...

2133
02:31:28,708 --> 02:31:29,333
Brother!

2134
02:31:33,792 --> 02:31:34,667
Shoot him.

2135
02:31:35,375 --> 02:31:36,333
SHOOT HIM!

2136
02:31:37,417 --> 02:31:39,458
I don't know how.
- Just do it!

2137
02:31:41,167 --> 02:31:42,708
Don't let him live.

2138
02:31:43,083 --> 02:31:45,167
I don't know how...
-Just shoot him!

2139
02:31:45,917 --> 02:31:47,375
Don't think...

2140
02:31:48,917 --> 02:31:50,208
Shoot him down.

2141
02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:25,875
Why are you so vengeful?

2142
02:32:26,250 --> 02:32:28,125
What are you avenging?

2143
02:32:28,625 --> 02:32:31,667
I would even kill for money.

2144
02:32:32,458 --> 02:32:35,958
Wouldn't I do it for my sister?
