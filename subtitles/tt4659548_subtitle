1
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:30,130
Nani (Granny)! Why is there a feast today?

2
00:06:30,967 --> 00:06:36,587
Honey your Grandpa has invited a respected
saint (Muniji) to discuss theology!

3
00:06:37,508 --> 00:06:40,298
Theology? What does that mean?

4
00:06:40,925 --> 00:06:45,175
Can I also be part of this feast,
if I discuss theology?

5
00:06:46,217 --> 00:06:48,427
It's not a child's play.

6
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,970
I am not a child.

7
00:06:51,967 --> 00:06:54,427
Really! When did you grow up?

8
00:06:54,425 --> 00:06:55,635
Long ago.

9
00:06:56,425 --> 00:06:57,965
C'mon now! Don't disturb me.

10
00:07:05,717 --> 00:07:07,887
Nani! May I take one?

11
00:07:07,883 --> 00:07:12,713
No, no, no! It's for the Saint.
Go and talk to your Nana (Grandpa). Go!

12
00:07:26,842 --> 00:07:29,552
Nana! I too want to discuss theology.

13
00:07:30,925 --> 00:07:35,135
Really! Theology is not a child's play.

14
00:07:35,133 --> 00:07:39,213
I am not a child.
Haven't I grown up? Even Nani says so.

15
00:07:39,217 --> 00:07:42,217
Oh yes! You're pretty grown up!

16
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:46,050
Son, we'll talk about it some other time.
Just remember,

17
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:50,630
Muniji will be here soon,
so don't misbehave. Alright?

18
00:07:51,342 --> 00:07:52,382
In the meantime, may I go and play?

19
00:07:52,383 --> 00:07:55,673
Yes and let me finish my work.

20
00:07:56,467 --> 00:08:00,507
One... four...

21
00:08:23,717 --> 00:08:25,967
Nani! Muniji (Saint) is here.

22
00:08:33,383 --> 00:08:34,423
Welcome! Muniji.

23
00:08:34,425 --> 00:08:36,255
God bless you.

24
00:08:36,967 --> 00:08:39,387
You're welcome to
this small abode of ours.

25
00:08:40,092 --> 00:08:43,882
My dear! It's not the house
but the heart that makes one great.

26
00:08:45,342 --> 00:08:47,672
Lord Krishna, Lord Krishna, Lord Krishna

27
00:08:49,717 --> 00:08:52,717
You must be coming from far,
please be seated.

28
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,720
Oh God! Your mercy is boundless.

29
00:08:57,342 --> 00:08:58,342
Thanks.

30
00:08:59,675 --> 00:09:03,005
Lord Krishna, Lord Krishna, Lord Krishna

31
00:09:03,717 --> 00:09:06,587
Amazing! What an appetizing aroma!

32
00:09:07,133 --> 00:09:11,673
All of a sudden my appetite,
I mean my body's appetite, has doubled.

33
00:09:12,717 --> 00:09:14,587
You're compassionate Muniji.

34
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:29,220
Lord Krishna, Lord Krishna, Lord Krishna.

35
00:09:30,133 --> 00:09:34,093
Thanks. May God bless you.

36
00:09:34,758 --> 00:09:35,838
Please have it Muniji.

37
00:09:35,842 --> 00:09:38,132
Lord Krishna, Lord Krishna

38
00:09:47,258 --> 00:09:53,338
Thanks for the food.
It was a heavenly experience.

39
00:09:54,342 --> 00:09:58,802
Now, ask anything you want to.
Please don't hesitate.

40
00:10:02,258 --> 00:10:08,968
Muniji, as I am ageing only
one question is bothering me.

41
00:10:10,342 --> 00:10:16,342
Is it possible for a worldly man like
me to go beyond human joys and sorrows?

42
00:10:17,217 --> 00:10:23,717
It is almost impossible to
be liberated in the worldy life.

43
00:10:25,467 --> 00:10:28,137
Nani! This is theology?

44
00:10:29,383 --> 00:10:33,053
Listen to what he's saying.

45
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:38,260
Howsoever one tries,
one cannot escape committing sin.

46
00:10:39,008 --> 00:10:43,178
If one earns some virtue,
like you did by serving food to me,

47
00:10:43,925 --> 00:10:47,595
one can reduce the misery of afterlife.

48
00:10:48,425 --> 00:10:51,045
But can't be liberated.

49
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:59,970
Every human should
always be afraid of hell.

50
00:11:02,758 --> 00:11:07,968
Because there are seven types of hell.

51
00:11:10,508 --> 00:11:16,088
God has created human in such a way that
after being tired of miseries of many lives,

52
00:11:17,133 --> 00:11:20,883
he takes the path of spirituality.

53
00:11:22,092 --> 00:11:23,962
That's the ultimate liberation.

54
00:11:27,008 --> 00:11:31,758
Have you ever seen hell?
Or have you ever met God?

55
00:11:32,592 --> 00:11:36,672
Such a naughty child.
Son, go out and play.

56
00:11:37,758 --> 00:11:42,048
Muniji! You should answer
the child's question.

57
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:44,130
I've studied the scriptures

58
00:11:44,883 --> 00:11:49,053
and whatever I am speaking
are the words of God.

59
00:11:49,675 --> 00:11:51,755
Then your God must be a sinner too.

60
00:11:52,342 --> 00:11:54,592
That's why he has created
us to commit sins.

61
00:11:55,717 --> 00:12:01,587
Son! Mind your tongue.
You are calling for trouble.

62
00:12:02,217 --> 00:12:06,217
Get him out of here.
He's talking nonsense.

63
00:12:07,425 --> 00:12:10,255
Children are form of God.

64
00:12:10,883 --> 00:12:13,923
Raja has all the right
to say whatever he wants to.

65
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:18,590
Insolence! What a blasphemy!

66
00:12:19,175 --> 00:12:21,005
I cannot stay here even for a second.

67
00:12:22,717 --> 00:12:28,507
Oh God! Oh Lord!
Forgive me. Insolence! Impudence!

68
00:12:31,383 --> 00:12:34,593
Go away! There is a
deep pond in our village.

69
00:12:35,092 --> 00:12:39,552
Go and drown yourself in that.
You'll be absolved of all your sins.

70
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:44,672
If God has to punish someone,
He first robs him of his wits...

71
00:12:44,675 --> 00:12:48,555
Hey boy! Take me to the other village.
Evil days are here...

72
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:51,010
I'll never step again in this house.

73
00:12:51,008 --> 00:12:53,298
Leave alone the house;
I'll never enter this village again.

74
00:12:53,300 --> 00:13:00,430
Lord Krishna, Lord Krishna, Lord Krishna

75
00:13:00,425 --> 00:13:04,095
What an insult!
Lord Krishna, Lord Krishna.

76
00:13:09,508 --> 00:13:11,428
Will you keep sulking now?

77
00:13:13,092 --> 00:13:15,842
You have not eaten anything the whole day.

78
00:13:19,675 --> 00:13:24,845
To be honest, sometimes God
himself speaks through children.

79
00:13:26,842 --> 00:13:34,262
Just think, whatever Raja said today,
is right in a way. Isn't it?

80
00:13:36,175 --> 00:13:42,135
Now let go of it.
Why are you reacting so much at a child?

81
00:13:43,633 --> 00:13:47,593
I'm not angry at Raja but myself.

82
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:53,470
Raja understood such a simple thing,
but why couldn't I?

83
00:13:53,467 --> 00:13:56,427
I think my age is showing up now.

84
00:14:07,508 --> 00:14:09,718
Madhwa Baba!
Give me some madhwa. (Divine Wine)

85
00:14:24,342 --> 00:14:25,672
It was delicious.

86
00:14:25,675 --> 00:14:30,885
Is it possible that I
come this way and not meet you?

87
00:14:32,133 --> 00:14:33,343
May I ask you something?

88
00:14:33,342 --> 00:14:34,722
Go ahead.

89
00:14:34,717 --> 00:14:37,387
Why do saints grow their beards and hair?

90
00:14:37,883 --> 00:14:40,963
We don't grow them. Its in
their nature is to grow by themselves.

91
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,260
It's others who cut them before growing.

92
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:46,922
May I ask you one more thing?
- Sure.

93
00:14:46,925 --> 00:14:48,215
Where do you stay?

94
00:14:48,217 --> 00:14:51,887
I'm a wanderer. I have no whereabouts.

95
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:56,220
I go wherever the path takes me.

96
00:14:59,925 --> 00:15:03,965
Nani has prepared this specially for you.

97
00:15:05,925 --> 00:15:11,545
If I stay here a little longer, I'll get
attached to you Raja. So, I must go now.

98
00:15:15,425 --> 00:15:17,175
Come sooner the next time.

99
00:15:46,717 --> 00:15:47,797
Nani...

100
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:48,720
Yes...

101
00:15:48,717 --> 00:15:53,137
I'm going to take a dip in the pond.
- No, no... Raja Wait... Listen to me...

102
00:15:53,133 --> 00:15:54,803
I've warmed the milk

103
00:15:57,675 --> 00:16:01,345
Oh God, I've warmed the
milk thrice since morning

104
00:16:02,092 --> 00:16:04,592
So warm it fourth time too.
It will turn into nice milk pudding...

105
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:08,170
This love of yours has spoilt him.

106
00:16:10,175 --> 00:16:14,345
Hey Bhura, Raja has gone to the pond

107
00:16:14,342 --> 00:16:15,462
Just take care of him

108
00:16:15,967 --> 00:16:16,967
Sure...

109
00:17:03,467 --> 00:17:05,467
My little world

110
00:17:06,383 --> 00:17:10,673
In my little heart, my little world...

111
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:16,220
In my little heart, my little world...

112
00:17:17,717 --> 00:17:25,097
A little house,
a little porch, a little garden

113
00:17:25,092 --> 00:17:26,802
A little house,
a little porch, a little garden

114
00:17:37,133 --> 00:17:38,133
Good, very good

115
00:17:43,008 --> 00:17:44,338
Just think a little wisely

116
00:17:44,342 --> 00:17:48,302
See, I can never forget your favors

117
00:17:48,883 --> 00:17:54,503
But right now I am very tired

118
00:17:57,342 --> 00:18:00,342
But it doesn't mean
that you leave from here

119
00:18:01,508 --> 00:18:03,798
I won't allow you to go,
at least in this condition

120
00:18:04,425 --> 00:18:07,675
Thanks, but I won't let
her stay here even for a minute

121
00:18:07,675 --> 00:18:08,845
No matter what happens

122
00:18:10,258 --> 00:18:13,798
If you also wish the
same then I am helpless

123
00:18:15,342 --> 00:18:17,342
She hasn't been here even for a month

124
00:18:17,342 --> 00:18:20,632
And today she will perform on the stage.
What a vamp!

125
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:23,673
I'm afraid;
she's going to spoil all my efforts.

126
00:18:23,675 --> 00:18:26,055
Father, nothing's going
to change by sitting here

127
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:27,220
Please do something

128
00:18:27,217 --> 00:18:29,177
What should I do? You tell me...

129
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:37,840
Nani, did you see how everyone
was so engrossed in the film?

130
00:18:37,842 --> 00:18:38,632
Yes

131
00:18:38,633 --> 00:18:40,883
It seemed that they
were thinking of it as real.

132
00:18:40,883 --> 00:18:42,303
But reality is something else.

133
00:18:42,883 --> 00:18:43,883
True.

134
00:18:45,008 --> 00:18:49,588
Everybody was so engrossed and so happy.

135
00:18:50,342 --> 00:18:51,972
Yes, that's what!

136
00:18:51,967 --> 00:18:54,547
I don't know if they even observed
the emptiness of the screen before

137
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:55,760
and after the screening.

138
00:18:56,467 --> 00:18:58,337
Instead they thought that film
is the only thing that's for real.

139
00:18:59,342 --> 00:19:01,052
Isn't it strange?

140
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:02,470
Yes...

141
00:19:02,467 --> 00:19:05,927
Nani ! Will the audience be,
equally happy or sad,

142
00:19:05,925 --> 00:19:08,795
when the show is over,
as they were, while the show was on?

143
00:19:11,092 --> 00:19:14,092
Son, even I don't know that.

144
00:19:34,175 --> 00:19:35,175
Bhura..

145
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:37,675
Yes
- Come here

146
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:41,010
Yes

147
00:19:41,008 --> 00:19:42,628
See, if it's my son in law?

148
00:19:45,592 --> 00:19:46,762
Yes

149
00:19:46,758 --> 00:19:48,678
Go! Help him with his luggage.

150
00:20:03,425 --> 00:20:04,465
Regards Amma.

151
00:20:06,717 --> 00:20:09,507
How are you?
- God Bless you.

152
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:11,298
Son, is everything fine?

153
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:13,300
Yes, with your good wishes.

154
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:17,050
Amma (Mother-in-law) I had
some work in the nearby village

155
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,680
So, I thought of visiting you as well.

156
00:20:19,675 --> 00:20:20,715
I am glad you did that.

157
00:20:20,717 --> 00:20:21,797
How is Raja?

158
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:24,340
Today he woke up early in the morning

159
00:20:24,342 --> 00:20:27,382
Now he must be troubling
his Nana in the name of his studies.

160
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:30,630
Lets go inside.
- Sure.

161
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,090
Regards Baba (Father-in-law)

162
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,300
God bless you Son.

163
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:47,550
Get some tea and snacks
for Damadji (Son-in-law).

164
00:20:48,883 --> 00:20:51,883
So how are your studies
progressing with Nanji?

165
00:20:51,883 --> 00:20:54,923
Oh, don't ask about his studies!
It's an uphill task for me.

166
00:20:56,092 --> 00:20:58,472
He finishes any book in two days.

167
00:20:58,467 --> 00:21:00,837
After that, he starts teaching me instead!

168
00:21:03,092 --> 00:21:05,422
If you have come to take me along,
let me make it clear

169
00:21:05,425 --> 00:21:06,795
that I am not coming with you.

170
00:21:07,883 --> 00:21:11,883
Son, I had come here for a business.
So I thought of meeting you.

171
00:21:12,467 --> 00:21:14,887
I am going to stay with my Nana and Nani.

172
00:21:15,425 --> 00:21:18,925
You stay with your Nana and Nani.
I am fine with it.

173
00:21:22,175 --> 00:21:24,045
How's it going son?

174
00:21:24,883 --> 00:21:26,673
All good.

175
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:30,550
Baba (Father-in-law),
I wanted to discuss something with you.

176
00:21:32,133 --> 00:21:36,003
Sure. But you must be tired.
So freshen up and relax for now.

177
00:21:36,925 --> 00:21:37,925
We'll talk later.

178
00:21:38,925 --> 00:21:39,925
Sure Baba.

179
00:21:44,883 --> 00:21:49,553
With Raja being around, it seems,
even our childhood has come back.

180
00:21:50,967 --> 00:21:53,887
Every moment is a joy.

181
00:21:55,342 --> 00:22:01,012
You are absolutely right
Baba but Raja is growing up.

182
00:22:02,175 --> 00:22:06,215
So we will have to admit him in a city
school, else his studies will get delayed.

183
00:22:06,217 --> 00:22:15,387
Look son! As long as I'm alive,
Raja will live in this village with me.

184
00:22:16,675 --> 00:22:21,845
As far as his studies are concerned,
I'll arrange for a good teacher here.

185
00:22:24,092 --> 00:22:29,962
I honor your word.
Please do whatever you feel is right.

186
00:22:31,383 --> 00:22:35,423
And son at this age I
may pass away all of a sudden.

187
00:22:35,425 --> 00:22:41,845
Don't say such things.
We need your blessings forever.

188
00:22:42,717 --> 00:22:45,637
Raja will stay with you
so please don't feel sad.

189
00:22:46,717 --> 00:22:48,217
But Baba, where is he?

190
00:22:52,342 --> 00:22:54,132
Oh friend, keep visiting.

191
00:22:56,217 --> 00:22:57,217
Gone.

192
00:22:58,133 --> 00:22:59,133
Gone.

193
00:22:59,133 --> 00:23:05,343
It goes in two minutes
and comes back in two seconds.

194
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:08,092
Goes like this, comes back like this.

195
00:23:38,592 --> 00:23:40,802
Hey, will you serve us food or not?

196
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,260
Damadji (Son-in-law) is hungry.
It's really too late.

197
00:23:43,258 --> 00:23:45,008
Few more minutes.

198
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:49,465
It seems Amma(Mother-in-law)
is preparing a whole lot of delicacies.

199
00:23:50,258 --> 00:23:53,628
Oh! Yes. That's why she
was grating and crushing nuts !

200
00:23:54,633 --> 00:23:58,173
She must have prepared delicious Kheer!
(milk pudding)

201
00:23:58,175 --> 00:24:00,845
Baba, keep it low.
Otherwise we won't get any food today.

202
00:24:01,633 --> 00:24:05,593
Listen, you'll have to watch
my magic show before dinner.

203
00:24:05,592 --> 00:24:08,672
No! We are hungry. Let's eat first.

204
00:24:08,675 --> 00:24:11,385
Nana! You'll have to watch it before.

205
00:24:11,383 --> 00:24:15,093
Didn't you hear what Nana said?
One should listen to the elders.

206
00:24:15,092 --> 00:24:18,212
Nani! Please come.
I am starting the magic show.

207
00:24:19,092 --> 00:24:20,472
Let me cook.

208
00:24:20,467 --> 00:24:22,717
No, if you won't come here,
I am not going to eat.

209
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:27,970
Ok. I am coming
- You have your food.

210
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:30,217
Ok! Now start the show.

211
00:24:30,217 --> 00:24:31,387
You've spoilt him.

212
00:24:31,383 --> 00:24:32,923
Its ok, he's just a child.

213
00:24:32,925 --> 00:24:33,925
Come on. We are waiting.

214
00:24:36,258 --> 00:24:37,258
Look at the lemon.

215
00:24:44,842 --> 00:24:48,512
Now you have to tell
me under which pot is it gone.

216
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:50,380
The center one.

217
00:24:50,925 --> 00:24:52,715
No, no it's under the right one.

218
00:24:53,592 --> 00:24:57,762
No. I know. It's under the left one.

219
00:25:05,758 --> 00:25:09,798
Oh, it's really magic!
Where has the lemon gone after all?

220
00:25:11,342 --> 00:25:13,342
It's in Nana's pocket...

221
00:25:13,342 --> 00:25:15,172
In Nana's pocket?
- Have a look...

222
00:25:15,175 --> 00:25:16,505
Let me see...

223
00:25:16,508 --> 00:25:17,758
How can it be in my pocket?

224
00:25:17,758 --> 00:25:19,468
If you don't believe, look for yourself...

225
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:25,420
It's amazing!
How did it reach in my pocket?

226
00:25:25,925 --> 00:25:29,045
There's no magic. These are mere tricks.

227
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:33,090
These saints befool us through
the means of these tricks.

228
00:25:39,842 --> 00:25:41,052
Namaskar.

229
00:25:41,675 --> 00:25:43,755
We are census officials.

230
00:25:43,758 --> 00:25:47,718
We have your names already
registered in our records.

231
00:25:47,717 --> 00:25:52,587
But as per the new law, we have
to note down your caste and religion too.

232
00:25:54,383 --> 00:25:56,633
We all belong to the caste of humanity.

233
00:25:57,717 --> 00:25:59,467
And about my religion,

234
00:26:00,258 --> 00:26:03,878
sometimes I am with sufis,
and sometimes with saints.

235
00:26:05,133 --> 00:26:09,963
Sometimes I'm in awe of Jaina
munis and sometimes, the sunset.

236
00:26:09,967 --> 00:26:15,257
This is the reality son.
We haven't understood religion so far.

237
00:26:16,258 --> 00:26:18,048
Everything seems like a puzzle.

238
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:21,720
When we will unsolve it,
we'll let you know.

239
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:25,880
We don't have such a column in our form.

240
00:26:25,883 --> 00:26:29,053
So, I'll have to describe
you as an atheist.

241
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:33,590
Whatever you wish.
Is it not enough to be a human being?

242
00:26:39,467 --> 00:26:46,467
Nanaji, it says that
Lord Buddha attained Nirvana.

243
00:26:47,342 --> 00:26:48,962
What is nirvana?

244
00:26:50,925 --> 00:27:00,095
Even I don't know the meaning
of Nirvana son. Most probably...

245
00:27:08,967 --> 00:27:11,507
What is it Nanaji? What's wrong?

246
00:27:12,717 --> 00:27:15,297
Nani... see what's happening to Nana...

247
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,970
What happened? What's wrong?

248
00:27:19,258 --> 00:27:20,258
What's happening?

249
00:27:21,258 --> 00:27:23,338
I am feeling suffocated...

250
00:27:27,175 --> 00:27:32,675
Bhura, Bhura come quickly...

251
00:27:34,217 --> 00:27:39,797
Difficulty... in breathing...

252
00:27:42,383 --> 00:27:44,343
I think we'll have to go to hospital

253
00:27:44,342 --> 00:27:46,552
I'll will bring the bullock cart...
- Yes. Go this instant

254
00:27:53,633 --> 00:27:54,633
Be quick

255
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:03,880
Be quick, Bhura...

256
00:28:06,217 --> 00:28:07,387
Let me do it...

257
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:50,800
“Why do you languish, O my heart…”

258
00:28:51,342 --> 00:28:59,342
“Why do you languish, O my heart…”

259
00:28:59,342 --> 00:29:06,422
“Why do the eyes overflow…”

260
00:29:06,967 --> 00:29:13,717
“Why do the eyes overflow…”

261
00:29:16,133 --> 00:29:19,593
The wheel... Stop the wheel...

262
00:29:37,258 --> 00:29:44,798
“Who has ever been able to stop the crazy cloud?”

263
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:51,920
“Who has ever been able to enchain the free wind?”

264
00:29:53,508 --> 00:30:02,508
My Lord..this life you have given to me..
I surrender it back to you...

265
00:30:07,633 --> 00:30:14,713
Rare is the one to
achieve the boundless sky

266
00:30:15,342 --> 00:30:23,012
Rare is the one to
achieve the boundless sky

267
00:30:23,008 --> 00:30:30,838
Rare is the one to go beyond
the world and the otherworld

268
00:30:30,842 --> 00:30:38,512
Why do you languish, O my heart...

269
00:30:38,508 --> 00:30:45,508
Why do you languish, O my heart...

270
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:08,840
Why do you languish, O my heart...

271
00:31:08,842 --> 00:31:16,512
Why do you languish, O my heart...

272
00:31:16,508 --> 00:31:24,338
Why do the eyes overflow...

273
00:31:24,342 --> 00:31:31,262
Why do the eyes overflow...

274
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:41,220
Why do you languish, O my heart...

275
00:31:44,050 --> 00:31:45,630
Baba...
- Yes son?

276
00:31:45,633 --> 00:31:46,883
May I ask you a question?

277
00:31:47,717 --> 00:31:50,677
As if you wouldn't  if  I say no.

278
00:31:52,008 --> 00:31:53,008
Go ahead.

279
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,670
How much water is there in a river?

280
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:01,090
In a river?
There is a lot of water in a river son.

281
00:32:02,342 --> 00:32:06,882
Exactly. But how much is that 'lot'?

282
00:32:07,883 --> 00:32:11,753
Its difficult to say,
but it has a lot of it

283
00:32:13,383 --> 00:32:17,553
Since you couldn't answer my question
you will have to teach me swimming.

284
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:19,920
You have become naughty!
Yes I'll teach you swimming for sure.

285
00:32:21,967 --> 00:32:26,007
You know, to swim you need
to use your legs more than your hands.

286
00:32:27,883 --> 00:32:30,843
We'll be worried if you will stay alone.

287
00:32:30,842 --> 00:32:34,092
You stay with us,
you'll have all the comforts.

288
00:32:35,467 --> 00:32:41,257
I know that but I want to stay alone.

289
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:47,548
I just want to live peacefully
in some isolated place now.

290
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:53,637
But Ma... We're all here... And Raja too.
You'll like it here.

291
00:32:54,467 --> 00:32:58,087
And without you,
this house will feel empty, Ma...

292
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:03,420
Emptiness is now a part of life...

293
00:33:04,633 --> 00:33:09,673
No matter how much
we try... We can't escape it.

294
00:33:11,342 --> 00:33:12,842
You are right Ma...

295
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:19,260
It feels very lonely after Baba went away...

296
00:33:21,133 --> 00:33:28,133
Now I wish to live in peace,
away from this town...

297
00:33:28,133 --> 00:33:29,883
What are you saying Ma?

298
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:35,675
And if you wish so, we'll get our ancestral
house near the river, repaired for you.

299
00:33:37,050 --> 00:33:40,300
Ma, I'm telling you again...
I'm going to stay with Nani..

300
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:42,920
Ok , Ok.. You stay with Nani.

301
00:33:44,050 --> 00:33:46,340
Let's have supper Ma, let's go...

302
00:33:47,592 --> 00:33:51,672
Nani, Baba has promised me
that he will teach me how to swim.

303
00:33:51,675 --> 00:33:52,675
That's good.

304
00:33:52,675 --> 00:33:55,305
But I am not sure if
he will really teach me.

305
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:56,670
Why do say so?

306
00:33:57,342 --> 00:34:01,762
Don't you see that when he is busy
in his shop, he forgets everything else.

307
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:04,970
I am sure that he will forget.

308
00:34:04,967 --> 00:34:06,847
Then how are you going to learn?

309
00:34:06,842 --> 00:34:12,052
I am sure that if I will get in the river,
the river will teach me how to swim.

310
00:34:13,342 --> 00:34:15,172
And who told you that?

311
00:34:15,175 --> 00:34:16,295
I just know.

312
00:34:17,717 --> 00:34:19,677
Nani! May I ask something?

313
00:34:19,675 --> 00:34:21,385
Yes.

314
00:34:21,383 --> 00:34:23,753
Nani. How much water is there in a river?

315
00:34:24,508 --> 00:34:28,338
In a river?
There is a lot of water in a river son.

316
00:34:53,258 --> 00:34:56,838
Enough. Be quite now.

317
00:35:00,675 --> 00:35:06,385
Children. Let me tell
you about the trees today.

318
00:35:07,467 --> 00:35:10,927
The tree is an inseparable
part of our life.

319
00:35:13,092 --> 00:35:15,012
It gives us life.

320
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:21,760
This book in my hand and those in yours,

321
00:35:22,592 --> 00:35:26,012
is also a gift from the tree.

322
00:35:33,508 --> 00:35:34,548
You! Boy!

323
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,260
What are you up to?

324
00:35:40,883 --> 00:35:43,803
Students call me Kantar Master.

325
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,470
I am credited with
disciplining the worst of lots.

326
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:47,300
Now come here

327
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,800
and have a taste of my punishment,

328
00:35:52,467 --> 00:35:54,587
which will open all
the windows of your mind.

329
00:35:59,467 --> 00:36:03,257
Didn't you hear?
Pack your bag and come here.

330
00:36:19,925 --> 00:36:21,215
What were you doing?

331
00:36:22,133 --> 00:36:24,673
You were saying that
trees are revered to us.

332
00:36:24,675 --> 00:36:27,005
So I got lost in their beauty...

333
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:32,048
How dare you answer back to Kantar Master?

334
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:34,550
Show me your hand.

335
00:36:38,633 --> 00:36:41,003
Didn't you hear? I said show me your hand.

336
00:36:56,925 --> 00:36:59,545
Why did you beat me
over such a petty issue?

337
00:37:00,217 --> 00:37:02,387
I'll complain about you to the headmaster.

338
00:37:02,383 --> 00:37:05,383
So, you will complaint about me?

339
00:37:06,342 --> 00:37:07,592
Are you threatening me?

340
00:37:08,633 --> 00:37:13,213
Go, nobody can take any
action against Kantar Master.

341
00:37:14,258 --> 00:37:19,378
All the educated people
in town have taken my beating.

342
00:37:22,008 --> 00:37:23,758
Go and do whatever you can.

343
00:37:25,425 --> 00:37:26,885
Nothing will come out of it!

344
00:37:29,925 --> 00:37:31,795
...So, children, I was saying...

345
00:37:39,258 --> 00:37:40,718
May I come in?

346
00:37:42,383 --> 00:37:43,463
Come in, child.

347
00:37:46,883 --> 00:37:49,093
I have to lodge a complaint.

348
00:37:50,258 --> 00:37:53,548
You are a new admission, right?
Tell me, what is it?

349
00:37:54,133 --> 00:37:55,633
Look at my hand.

350
00:37:57,175 --> 00:37:58,215
What happened?

351
00:37:58,217 --> 00:38:00,927
Kantar Master is responsible
for this violence.

352
00:38:00,925 --> 00:38:04,755
And I didn't do anything
to deserve such harsh punishment.

353
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:07,510
You should do something about this.

354
00:38:07,508 --> 00:38:10,588
Look son, all these
things happen in the school.

355
00:38:10,592 --> 00:38:12,552
Slowly you will understand and accept it.

356
00:38:13,467 --> 00:38:15,637
And Kantar Master is my senior;

357
00:38:16,175 --> 00:38:18,345
I won't be able to do anything about this.

358
00:38:18,342 --> 00:38:20,592
Ok, so who is above you?

359
00:38:20,592 --> 00:38:23,262
The municipal chairman is above me.

360
00:38:23,258 --> 00:38:26,378
But why such a big fuss
over such a small matter?

361
00:38:27,008 --> 00:38:30,838
My Nanaji has taught
me never to bear injustice,

362
00:38:30,842 --> 00:38:33,262
and never to side with untruth.

363
00:38:33,258 --> 00:38:34,838
I will you're your leave now. Namaste.

364
00:39:35,467 --> 00:39:36,837
May I come in?

365
00:39:38,925 --> 00:39:40,295
Sure. Come in son.

366
00:39:43,467 --> 00:39:44,347
Have a seat.

367
00:39:44,342 --> 00:39:45,802
No, I'm Ok.

368
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,510
I have to make a complaint to you...

369
00:39:47,508 --> 00:39:49,298
Complaint? Go ahead..

370
00:39:50,758 --> 00:39:53,468
The Kantar Master's behavior
towards me was violent in school.

371
00:39:53,467 --> 00:39:55,547
When I told about this to the headmaster,

372
00:39:55,550 --> 00:39:57,970
he said he can't do anything about this.

373
00:39:57,967 --> 00:39:59,717
That's why I've come to you.

374
00:40:01,383 --> 00:40:02,383
Hmm,

375
00:40:03,758 --> 00:40:06,178
It has been brought
to my notice even before.

376
00:40:07,175 --> 00:40:09,465
But nobody has dared
to speak much against him.

377
00:40:10,175 --> 00:40:14,135
Now that you are telling me,
we'll do something.

378
00:40:16,717 --> 00:40:20,887
Ok, tell me, what did that he do exactly?

379
00:40:21,633 --> 00:40:26,423
He was telling us about the
importance of trees during the class.

380
00:40:26,425 --> 00:40:28,675
That's when I noticed a
beautiful tree outside the window.

381
00:40:28,675 --> 00:40:30,305
and started observing it.

382
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:33,340
Seeing me doing this,
he called me and hit me with a stick.

383
00:40:33,342 --> 00:40:35,262
Now you tell me whether
its right or wrong?

384
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:40,510
It's absolutely wrong.
You were trying to apply his teaching.

385
00:40:41,133 --> 00:40:43,093
Yes, that's why I had to come here.

386
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,220
Don't you feel afraid?

387
00:40:46,217 --> 00:40:50,507
No, Nani says if you
not done anything wrong,

388
00:40:50,508 --> 00:40:52,508
you don't need to be afraid at all.

389
00:40:54,883 --> 00:40:56,553
I will take your leave now. Namaste.

390
00:41:06,883 --> 00:41:08,173
Are you looking for someone?

391
00:41:09,925 --> 00:41:11,755
Is this the school for grownups?

392
00:41:11,758 --> 00:41:13,428
No son, this is called a library.

393
00:41:13,425 --> 00:41:17,135
Children and grownups come here
on their own and read what they like.

394
00:41:17,842 --> 00:41:19,512
How many books must be here?

395
00:41:20,133 --> 00:41:21,213
What is your age?

396
00:41:21,883 --> 00:41:22,763
Eleven years...

397
00:41:22,758 --> 00:41:24,838
So, if you come here for next eleven years

398
00:41:24,842 --> 00:41:26,972
and read a book of your liking every day,

399
00:41:26,967 --> 00:41:29,337
even then you won't be able to finish them
all. Such is the number of books here!

400
00:41:33,425 --> 00:41:34,425
What are you thinking about?

401
00:41:35,050 --> 00:41:37,430
May I come in? I want to see the books.

402
00:41:37,425 --> 00:41:39,545
Really, come on in.

403
00:41:42,342 --> 00:41:48,342
Kantar is gone! Kantar is gone!!

404
00:41:48,342 --> 00:41:49,592
O, Raja has come.

405
00:41:50,258 --> 00:41:55,218
Raja, do you know, Kantar is gone?
He'll never come back to this school.

406
00:41:55,217 --> 00:41:57,677
He's been transferred to some remote area.

407
00:41:58,967 --> 00:42:00,757
Give me a high five...

408
00:42:00,758 --> 00:42:06,088
Kantar is gone! Kantar is gone!!

409
00:42:08,925 --> 00:42:10,385
What should our leader be like?

410
00:42:10,383 --> 00:42:12,003
He should be like Ram Singh.

411
00:42:15,508 --> 00:42:21,298
Long live Ram Singh. Long live Ram Singh.

412
00:42:29,717 --> 00:42:31,427
What should our leader be like?

413
00:42:31,425 --> 00:42:33,385
He should be like Ram Singh.

414
00:42:33,383 --> 00:42:35,093
What should our leader be like?

415
00:42:35,092 --> 00:42:36,672
He should be like Ram Singh.

416
00:43:00,342 --> 00:43:04,302
Bhaiya, are you a true
follower of this leader?

417
00:43:05,467 --> 00:43:09,927
No, we come just for
the sweets and some money.

418
00:43:09,925 --> 00:43:10,925
Really?

419
00:43:13,008 --> 00:43:14,048
Even I'll get all that?

420
00:43:14,050 --> 00:43:16,300
Sure, go and take it.

421
00:43:26,508 --> 00:43:30,088
God's name is truth. God's name is truth...

422
00:43:30,092 --> 00:43:31,802
He who seeks truth is liberated...

423
00:44:37,883 --> 00:44:41,503
Ok, so his story is over.
Now, let's talk about the real issue.

424
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:43,300
The issue?

425
00:44:44,342 --> 00:44:45,922
Yes, the issue.

426
00:44:47,050 --> 00:44:50,720
The issue is that the shop is
mine from today. The rest you guys divide.

427
00:44:51,258 --> 00:44:52,258
The rest?

428
00:44:53,342 --> 00:44:56,592
I've been tending to the shop
since three years, so it should be mine.

429
00:44:56,592 --> 00:44:59,722
So what? You were tending the
shop for three years. But not anymore.

430
00:44:59,717 --> 00:45:02,637
Look, I'm younger to both of you.
But now I'll take care of the shop.

431
00:45:02,633 --> 00:45:06,633
If you are younger, behave yourself.
Don't make me angry.

432
00:45:06,633 --> 00:45:08,633
The shop is mine and I'll run it.

433
00:45:08,633 --> 00:45:11,923
You are elder, so show some maturity.
The shop is mine.

434
00:45:12,425 --> 00:45:14,965
Yes, I am showing maturity.
The eldest has the first right.

435
00:45:14,967 --> 00:45:16,757
Give me the keys, and let me run the shop.

436
00:45:16,758 --> 00:45:19,468
Hey shut up.

437
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:24,050
Father had told me
that I should run the shop.

438
00:45:24,050 --> 00:45:25,090
When did he say that?

439
00:45:25,092 --> 00:45:26,012
Should I ask him?

440
00:45:26,008 --> 00:45:27,888
I am going to run the shop now, that's it.

441
00:45:27,883 --> 00:45:29,763
Shut up. You'll run the shop!

442
00:45:29,758 --> 00:45:31,928
Don't even dare to
look towards the shop now.

443
00:45:31,925 --> 00:45:33,805
The keys of the shop are with me.
And I'll keep the shop.

444
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:35,340
I'll get the lock broken
and put a new lock.

445
00:45:35,342 --> 00:45:37,632
Don't you dare come near
the shop from tomorrow. Understand?

446
00:45:37,633 --> 00:45:41,713
You guys stop fighting now.
First give me my sweets and money.

447
00:45:43,050 --> 00:45:45,970
Sweets? Money? Huh?

448
00:45:48,425 --> 00:45:50,795
There must be thousands
of books in the library.

449
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:53,590
You must be enjoying very much!

450
00:45:53,592 --> 00:45:54,632
Yes I do.

451
00:45:54,633 --> 00:45:56,593
You must have read all the books.

452
00:45:57,258 --> 00:45:58,468
No, but I have read many.

453
00:45:59,925 --> 00:46:02,845
But since last few years,
I haven't read any book.

454
00:46:03,342 --> 00:46:04,962
Now I don't feel like reading.

455
00:46:06,133 --> 00:46:08,633
Do you know,
there are many such books in the library

456
00:46:08,633 --> 00:46:10,213
that no one has ever even touched?

457
00:46:10,925 --> 00:46:12,175
How come?

458
00:46:12,175 --> 00:46:15,635
So many people come
to the library every day.

459
00:46:15,633 --> 00:46:18,213
How can any book remain untouched?

460
00:46:18,217 --> 00:46:22,887
The same way son, as we are untouched
by nature even after living in it.

461
00:46:24,175 --> 00:46:28,215
You are right.
Isn't this nature a library too?

462
00:46:28,217 --> 00:46:32,087
These rivers, these mountains,
and this jungle...are all its books.

463
00:46:33,008 --> 00:46:34,008
Very well said.

464
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,720
May I ask you something?
- Yes, sure.

465
00:46:37,342 --> 00:46:40,592
Do you remember when I met you in library,

466
00:46:40,592 --> 00:46:43,972
you were arranging books
and dropped two of them...

467
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:46,677
you picked them and touched one
with your forehead  and not the other one.

468
00:46:47,592 --> 00:46:48,802
Why did you do that?

469
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:51,380
Because it was our Lord Ram's book.

470
00:46:52,675 --> 00:46:56,465
But all the books look alike...
All of them give us knowledge.

471
00:46:56,467 --> 00:46:58,007
Then why did you do that?

472
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:19,380
Tell me who's this?

473
00:47:20,758 --> 00:47:21,888
I know who this is.

474
00:47:21,883 --> 00:47:23,053
So tell me.

475
00:47:23,050 --> 00:47:24,420
My son Raja!

476
00:47:26,925 --> 00:47:29,805
In these summer vacations,
I'll simply have fun.

477
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:30,970
Will do nothing else...

478
00:47:31,675 --> 00:47:33,635
That's what you always do.

479
00:47:33,633 --> 00:47:36,803
Sometimes you should go
to the shop and help your father.

480
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:39,430
Help father in the shop? Never!!

481
00:47:39,425 --> 00:47:42,095
He leaves me in the shop
and forgets all about me.

482
00:47:42,092 --> 00:47:43,462
What would I help him with?

483
00:47:45,258 --> 00:47:51,138
Nobody can understand you.
You do whatever you feel like doing. Ok?

484
00:47:51,133 --> 00:47:52,133
Ok.

485
00:48:03,550 --> 00:48:05,920
Baba, I don't like to be here in the shop.

486
00:48:06,675 --> 00:48:08,965
I like to be by the
river or at the library.

487
00:48:10,133 --> 00:48:11,343
Ok, ok. That's all right.

488
00:48:12,133 --> 00:48:13,213
What are you holding in your hands?

489
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:14,800
Show me...

490
00:48:16,258 --> 00:48:19,758
What is all this trash?
Go out and throw them.

491
00:48:20,342 --> 00:48:23,552
No, I won't throw them.
They are very precious to me.

492
00:48:23,550 --> 00:48:27,510
I play with these stones and
look at the sky with the colored glasses.

493
00:48:27,508 --> 00:48:29,298
I enjoy them a lot.

494
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:31,050
Don't you understand anything that I say?

495
00:48:31,050 --> 00:48:33,550
I said, go out and throw them away.

496
00:48:34,133 --> 00:48:36,093
I'll throw them away,
but on one condition.

497
00:48:36,675 --> 00:48:39,425
Even you'll have to throw
away all your earnings.

498
00:48:39,425 --> 00:48:40,635
Do you agree?

499
00:48:41,508 --> 00:48:42,758
I'll have to throw the money?

500
00:48:46,050 --> 00:48:50,470
Son, do you even know that how
this house and this shop is being covered?

501
00:48:51,008 --> 00:48:54,638
It's with this money.
Money is very precious son.

502
00:48:54,633 --> 00:48:57,963
Likewise these stones are precious for me.

503
00:48:58,508 --> 00:49:04,508
You go, go to your library
and be with the books. Leave me alone.

504
00:49:05,217 --> 00:49:07,007
I'll take care of the shop by myself.

505
00:49:08,967 --> 00:49:12,597
Baba, I've been sitting
in this shop for so long.

506
00:49:12,592 --> 00:49:16,342
I'm hungry,
give me some money to buy sweets.

507
00:49:17,967 --> 00:49:22,177
Aha...You have chosen the right business.

508
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:25,845
Just go and buy your sweets,
with your precious stones and glasses.

509
00:49:27,383 --> 00:49:31,593
I feel, that when you grow up, you will be
charging your clients for just doing nothing.

510
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:40,970
Take it.

511
00:49:51,383 --> 00:49:52,463
Rama-Rama, Uncle.

512
00:49:52,467 --> 00:49:53,887
Rama-Rama, Raja.
How are you.

513
00:49:53,883 --> 00:49:55,343
I'm fine.

514
00:49:55,342 --> 00:49:59,672
Our school teacher wants
to order 50 kilos of sweets.

515
00:49:59,675 --> 00:50:01,255
What will be the rate?

516
00:50:01,258 --> 00:50:03,338
I'll fix the right price
by the grace of Lord Rama...

517
00:50:03,342 --> 00:50:04,672
Tell me, when he'll need it?

518
00:50:04,675 --> 00:50:07,545
Right now give me sample of an Anna only.
He'll like to taste it first.

519
00:50:08,508 --> 00:50:12,008
No need to pay anything, take it for free.

520
00:50:15,050 --> 00:50:16,260
Hey...One Anna...

521
00:50:16,258 --> 00:50:18,178
But, you told me yourself to take it free.

522
00:50:19,383 --> 00:50:21,093
When you'll be ordering fifty kilos.

523
00:50:23,175 --> 00:50:25,885
Right now it is two months
of vacation...I'll let you know later.

524
00:50:25,883 --> 00:50:27,843
May curse fall upon
you...By the grace of Rama.

525
00:50:27,842 --> 00:50:29,342
Hey Dhannu...Go and catch him.

526
00:50:29,342 --> 00:50:31,342
May curse fall upon him.
He has cheated me again.

527
00:50:32,675 --> 00:50:33,795
By the grace of Rama...

528
00:50:34,550 --> 00:50:38,470
Long live,
Magga Baba...Long live, Magga Baba...

529
00:51:03,717 --> 00:51:08,467
Sir. Who is this old man...And
where did he come from?

530
00:51:08,467 --> 00:51:10,097
He is our dear Magga Baba.

531
00:51:10,092 --> 00:51:14,552
Last month people from neighboring
village had stolen him away,

532
00:51:14,550 --> 00:51:16,180
after lot of trouble
we have brought him back.

533
00:51:16,175 --> 00:51:19,885
Really? Unbelievable.
What's so special about him?

534
00:51:19,883 --> 00:51:22,173
Special? He is a man of miracle.

535
00:51:22,175 --> 00:51:24,505
Where ever he goes,
happiness follows him.

536
00:51:27,342 --> 00:51:30,052
Magga...Magga...Gibberish...

537
00:51:30,050 --> 00:51:31,380
...Gibberish...

538
00:52:10,925 --> 00:52:13,005
Baba! What's the name
of the language you speak?

539
00:52:13,008 --> 00:52:14,588
...Gibberish...

540
00:52:16,092 --> 00:52:17,632
It is fun to meet you.

541
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:25,760
Wow! It's a good deal.

542
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:31,590
If quite funny that your
mysterious mug can double my money.

543
00:52:31,592 --> 00:52:35,422
I think we will be good friends.
Now I will take your leave.

544
00:52:51,633 --> 00:52:54,343
Nani. Today I met the famous Magga Baba.

545
00:52:54,342 --> 00:52:56,132
It was a wonderful meeting him.

546
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:58,550
So just  wondering
what's so special in him.

547
00:52:59,717 --> 00:53:05,257
Son. It may be possible that
he has solved this riddle called life.

548
00:53:07,008 --> 00:53:11,678
Nani. Why is it so that
the mind keeps asking questions

549
00:53:11,675 --> 00:53:13,635
but is not able to get the right answers?

550
00:53:14,925 --> 00:53:18,635
Son. Don't stop till
you get the right answer.

551
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:21,420
Finally, someday it
will defeat the question.

552
00:53:25,092 --> 00:53:27,672
Baba, is this river very deep.

553
00:53:28,675 --> 00:53:29,845
Yes, so what.

554
00:53:31,133 --> 00:53:32,133
Here also.

555
00:53:32,633 --> 00:53:33,633
Very deep.

556
00:53:36,258 --> 00:53:37,298
And on that side.

557
00:53:38,633 --> 00:53:39,673
Much deeper.

558
00:53:41,883 --> 00:53:44,093
Why? Are you scared?

559
00:53:44,092 --> 00:53:46,262
No. I'm not afraid of anything.

560
00:53:47,217 --> 00:53:48,967
Are there any fishes?

561
00:53:48,967 --> 00:53:49,967
Alligators too.

562
00:53:51,592 --> 00:53:52,672
Now you must be scared?

563
00:53:53,925 --> 00:53:54,925
Never.

564
00:53:56,508 --> 00:54:00,548
Baba look. That cloud looks
like a wise man. Doesn't it?

565
00:54:01,133 --> 00:54:02,133
What?

566
00:54:04,092 --> 00:54:05,132
Yes. Right.

567
00:54:15,883 --> 00:54:16,923
What are you thinking?

568
00:54:17,467 --> 00:54:20,337
I'm just thinking that when
did you might have learned swimming.

569
00:54:25,550 --> 00:54:26,590
You seem to be scared?

570
00:54:26,592 --> 00:54:27,592
No.

571
00:54:28,842 --> 00:54:29,842
Not even a bit?

572
00:54:29,842 --> 00:54:30,842
Not at all.

573
00:54:33,883 --> 00:54:34,883
Not even of drowning?

574
00:54:34,883 --> 00:54:35,883
No.

575
00:54:37,633 --> 00:54:38,713
Might be a bit?

576
00:54:38,717 --> 00:54:39,717
No.

577
00:55:08,592 --> 00:55:11,172
Raja. Ra..ja.

578
00:55:11,175 --> 00:55:13,545
Baba! So you do speak .

579
00:55:14,550 --> 00:55:15,720
I always knew it.

580
00:55:16,217 --> 00:55:17,387
You were fooling us all.

581
00:55:20,050 --> 00:55:22,220
Where have your followers gone today?

582
00:55:22,217 --> 00:55:24,547
I've chased them away... chased them away...

583
00:55:24,550 --> 00:55:26,840
Nobody understood...

584
00:55:28,383 --> 00:55:30,053
A bunch of fools...

585
00:55:31,717 --> 00:55:33,427
Magga... magga...

586
00:55:34,425 --> 00:55:35,845
Baba! Is that your name?

587
00:55:36,675 --> 00:55:38,595
No. Magga. An empty mug.

588
00:55:40,508 --> 00:55:41,588
Thirst..thirst...

589
00:55:42,550 --> 00:55:44,510
Will your thirst be quenched?

590
00:55:49,050 --> 00:55:52,970
Baba. I don't know why
is my mind always thirsty.

591
00:55:54,008 --> 00:55:56,378
Sometimes I search for the
answers in the books at library

592
00:55:57,383 --> 00:55:59,593
And sometimes in the depths of the river.

593
00:56:01,342 --> 00:56:02,712
But it never attains the inner peace.

594
00:56:05,175 --> 00:56:09,255
You drown in... drown in... Die! Die!

595
00:56:13,258 --> 00:56:16,428
It can be awaken only if you let it drown.

596
00:56:16,425 --> 00:56:17,425
Baba.

597
00:56:18,925 --> 00:56:20,755
Why do you speak like that?

598
00:56:22,550 --> 00:56:27,130
Magga is going... Magga
will go... Magga is gone...

599
00:56:29,217 --> 00:56:33,087
Baba. Once you leave,
I will be left all alone.

600
00:56:34,675 --> 00:56:38,175
Magga is going... Paggal is coming.

601
00:56:39,175 --> 00:56:41,135
Paggal comes... Magga goes...

602
00:56:41,133 --> 00:56:42,963
Will he also be like you... a silent Baba.

603
00:56:42,967 --> 00:56:47,837
He will speak... He will
explain... He will show...

604
00:56:49,342 --> 00:56:52,092
Baba, I am younger to you.
Why are you touching my feet?

605
00:56:52,092 --> 00:56:56,422
My respect to the one, who will be coming.

606
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:09,930
Greetings.

607
00:57:09,925 --> 00:57:13,465
Oh! Rajni. Long time.

608
00:57:14,092 --> 00:57:15,262
Please be seated.

609
00:57:15,258 --> 00:57:16,048
How're you doing?

610
00:57:16,050 --> 00:57:17,380
Fine. And how about you?

611
00:57:17,383 --> 00:57:18,383
All's well.

612
00:57:21,717 --> 00:57:24,887
So how are the city dwellers gracing
this small town with their presence?

613
00:57:25,842 --> 00:57:27,212
What to do Vidyasagar?

614
00:57:28,008 --> 00:57:30,508
When one's is fed up of
small-hearted people of big cites,

615
00:57:31,425 --> 00:57:34,385
one is bound to be attracted back to the roots,
the known fragrance of one's own land.

616
00:57:34,383 --> 00:57:37,503
Isn't this the same naughty Shashi,
who always used to puncture my bicycle's tires?

617
00:57:39,258 --> 00:57:42,718
Be careful! Now I can also
puncture the tires of cars too.

618
00:57:44,925 --> 00:57:47,545
This is my friend Raja.

619
00:57:48,217 --> 00:57:50,007
He is one of his own
crazy kind in this town.

620
00:57:50,633 --> 00:57:53,713
He looks like a fine young man.
Why are you lamenting him as crazy?

621
00:57:53,717 --> 00:57:55,087
You don't know Rajni.

622
00:57:55,883 --> 00:57:57,463
At this tender age,

623
00:57:57,467 --> 00:58:01,717
Raja has read all the dusty and
dampened books from our library, verbatim.

624
00:58:02,467 --> 00:58:05,007
But still his hungry
mind is as empty as ever.

625
00:58:05,008 --> 00:58:07,218
Now you tell me,
isn't it fair to call him crazy?

626
00:58:08,425 --> 00:58:09,885
If water alone can quench the thirst,

627
00:58:10,508 --> 00:58:12,178
then why would've river been flowing?

628
00:58:14,008 --> 00:58:15,468
What a profound thought?
That too at this age?

629
00:58:16,342 --> 00:58:21,012
And so much thirst to know the unknown?
I'm sure we'll be great friends.

630
00:58:22,258 --> 00:58:25,338
Let's stop this duet of thoughts
and take a walk to the river.

631
00:58:25,342 --> 00:58:26,382
Yes. Let's go.

632
00:58:30,342 --> 00:58:33,132
Thanks Shashi for taking us there,
once again.

633
00:58:36,467 --> 00:58:40,967
It's good that in this isolated town,
you've found friends like Rajni and Shashi.

634
00:58:41,467 --> 00:58:44,927
Otherwise you would've surly
gone insane reading all those books.

635
00:58:46,050 --> 00:58:49,220
Nani. Don't worry.  I won't become insane.

636
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:51,510
In fact I'm the one
who makes others go crazy.

637
00:58:52,467 --> 00:58:55,467
AlakhNiranjan...(Invisible Omnipresent)

638
00:58:55,467 --> 00:58:58,757
What a timing? We are talking
about crazy and here comes a Baba.

639
00:58:59,258 --> 00:59:02,378
AlakhNiranjan.

640
00:59:05,133 --> 00:59:06,673
AlakhNiranjan.

641
00:59:08,425 --> 00:59:12,505
Mother, the whole world
calls me mad... mad ...

642
00:59:13,175 --> 00:59:14,635
and the Mad One just silently smiles.

643
00:59:15,633 --> 00:59:19,843
You've called the mad
one... and Paggal is right here.

644
00:59:22,883 --> 00:59:27,173
Magga Baba has specially
sent me to meet Raja.

645
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:30,840
Mother, exactly one month from now,

646
00:59:32,008 --> 00:59:36,428
I want to take Raja to
a journey of Bharat (India).

647
00:59:38,300 --> 00:59:41,220
O Mother,
this tour is very necessary for Raja,

648
00:59:42,008 --> 00:59:44,218
for his advancement in his inward journey.

649
00:59:45,758 --> 00:59:48,428
Raja's father has already
sanctioned his permission.

650
00:59:49,758 --> 00:59:54,298
Baba. I feel blessed that I'll
be joining you in this tour of India.

651
00:59:58,050 --> 01:00:00,800
AlakhNiranjan...

652
01:00:01,967 --> 01:00:03,837
AlakhNiranjan...

653
01:00:04,550 --> 01:00:07,130
AlakhNiranjan...

654
01:00:10,925 --> 01:00:12,845
Today Shashi is preparing tea and snacks.

655
01:00:13,342 --> 01:00:14,672
It's good that you've come.

656
01:00:15,592 --> 01:00:18,762
Since this afternoon I've been
feeling gloomy for some unknown reason.

657
01:00:20,300 --> 01:00:22,720
It seems, just as the
noises of big city are scary,

658
01:00:23,467 --> 01:00:25,297
so is the silence of this small town.

659
01:00:27,008 --> 01:00:29,338
Rajni. You have such
rare treasure of books,

660
01:00:29,925 --> 01:00:31,755
there should be no reason
for you to be gloomy at all.

661
01:00:32,425 --> 01:00:35,675
I always try to pacify
my uneasy mind in these books...

662
01:00:35,675 --> 01:00:37,925
or sometimes in the depth of the river.

663
01:00:38,633 --> 01:00:39,803
You can also try this.

664
01:00:44,217 --> 01:00:49,047
My late husband Asgar Ali and
I became friends through these books.

665
01:00:50,008 --> 01:00:52,468
He loved to explore every new book...

666
01:00:52,467 --> 01:00:56,297
And I loved to get acquainted
with every new person.

667
01:00:57,758 --> 01:00:59,678
Shashi  and I share same interests.

668
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:04,760
His name was Asgar Ali...
and yours Rajni... How come?

669
01:01:10,050 --> 01:01:12,800
My first marriage was
in a well known Hindu family...

670
01:01:13,883 --> 01:01:16,383
but unfortunately our
hearts never got in tune.

671
01:01:18,342 --> 01:01:19,762
And one day, along with my daughter,

672
01:01:21,258 --> 01:01:24,378
I revolted against the conditions
imposed by the society...

673
01:01:25,717 --> 01:01:30,717
In those days of turmoil, Asgar
Ali came to our rescue and supported us...

674
01:01:32,508 --> 01:01:37,338
Those were the golden days of
our life which we spent in his company.

675
01:01:39,925 --> 01:01:42,795
But God's sent angel
has to return one day...

676
01:01:44,508 --> 01:01:46,878
so in an accident he left us forever...

677
01:01:50,133 --> 01:01:52,463
I am going to serve this tea and snacks,

678
01:01:52,467 --> 01:01:54,507
only to those who have
smiles on their lips.

679
01:02:16,383 --> 01:02:19,593
Such delicate fingers...
it must be of some sneaking cat.

680
01:02:21,633 --> 01:02:23,253
You know, how did I reach here?

681
01:02:24,050 --> 01:02:25,090
How?

682
01:02:25,092 --> 01:02:27,222
I kept asking everyone while walking,

683
01:02:27,217 --> 01:02:29,387
that has anyone seen a
rumbling-junk that you call bicycle

684
01:02:29,383 --> 01:02:31,053
and everybody pointed
me towards this direction.

685
01:02:31,050 --> 01:02:32,680
Ok. So you call this
bicycle a rumbling junk?

686
01:02:32,675 --> 01:02:34,255
Yes. A perfect junk.

687
01:02:35,258 --> 01:02:39,428
Be cautious before calling
names to my dearest bicycle.

688
01:02:39,425 --> 01:02:41,255
Else I'll never ever teach you cycling.

689
01:02:41,258 --> 01:02:42,888
But I was not the one
who was calling those names.

690
01:02:42,883 --> 01:02:44,093
It is the others who do.

691
01:02:44,925 --> 01:02:48,925
I know you very well, anyway
I'm not going to teach you cycling.

692
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:53,510
I am so sorry.
I also apologize to your darling bicycle.

693
01:02:53,508 --> 01:02:55,218
Now come on...  get up and let's get going.

694
01:03:01,133 --> 01:03:03,633
Wow... it's fun to ride this thing.

695
01:03:08,550 --> 01:03:10,800
Be careful... Oh oh...

696
01:03:15,300 --> 01:03:16,970
Look I'm hurt...

697
01:03:16,967 --> 01:03:17,967
It's nothing...

698
01:03:22,383 --> 01:03:25,213
You know Shashi,
life is also like cycling.

699
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:29,840
Once we learn the art of balancing,
life may go on smoothly.

700
01:03:31,508 --> 01:03:33,218
I'll too want to learn balancing.

701
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:36,630
I'll teach you.

702
01:03:37,467 --> 01:03:38,597
So... let's go...

703
01:03:38,592 --> 01:03:39,592
Let's go.

704
01:03:56,217 --> 01:03:59,337
I hope you won't make me fall
again the next time we do this.

705
01:04:04,675 --> 01:04:08,385
Raja. Don't you get bored sometimes,
in this small town?

706
01:04:09,508 --> 01:04:12,548
Whenever my mind gets tired,
I go and sit by the river bank

707
01:04:13,633 --> 01:04:17,053
or gaze at the dancing
trees and clouds for hours.

708
01:04:17,050 --> 01:04:20,550
And sometimes I just love roaming
in the bazaar, looking at unknown faces.

709
01:04:22,092 --> 01:04:24,632
Or start reading interesting
signs boards on the shops

710
01:04:25,717 --> 01:04:27,757
This is how I refresh my mind.

711
01:04:28,425 --> 01:04:30,465
Look. What's written here!

712
01:04:30,467 --> 01:04:34,467
Get a hair cut here and it will free
you from all the burdens of your life.

713
01:04:35,633 --> 01:04:37,763
And look what's written down there!

714
01:04:37,758 --> 01:04:40,218
Special concession for those
who want to get rid of the whole head.

715
01:04:43,175 --> 01:04:46,045
Raja. Today I've to buy some
clothes from your father's shop.

716
01:04:46,675 --> 01:04:50,215
Then I should warn you beforehand,
that today you may lose all your money.

717
01:04:50,217 --> 01:04:54,007
Is this the way you promote
your father's business?

718
01:04:54,008 --> 01:04:58,048
Yes. That's the reason my father
never ever lets me enter his shop.

719
01:05:00,592 --> 01:05:02,092
Girdhari.
- Yes.

720
01:05:02,092 --> 01:05:05,842
We had sent four saris and blouse
for the marriage of MadhavLal's daughter

721
01:05:05,842 --> 01:05:07,512
Yes.
- but haven't receive any payment yet.

722
01:05:07,508 --> 01:05:08,718
It's been long overdue.
So go and enquire.

723
01:05:10,342 --> 01:05:12,262
Greetings
- Greetings

724
01:05:12,258 --> 01:05:15,218
We're Raja's friends. He reveres you,

725
01:05:15,758 --> 01:05:18,548
so we thought of meeting you,
and buy some cloth too.

726
01:05:19,717 --> 01:05:22,137
That's wonderful. Please come in.

727
01:05:24,467 --> 01:05:27,677
But it's little difficult for
me to imagine that Raja reveres me.

728
01:05:27,675 --> 01:05:30,755
Anyway. You have honored
me by coming here

729
01:05:31,342 --> 01:05:33,922
and thanks to both of you,
I'm able to see Raja's face.

730
01:05:33,925 --> 01:05:36,635
Otherwise he is always
busy with his books.

731
01:05:36,633 --> 01:05:39,003
He is never bothered about
his parents and other worldly affairs.

732
01:05:40,175 --> 01:05:41,885
But uncle I was wondering.

733
01:05:42,675 --> 01:05:46,675
You're sending Raja away
for a month with some Paggal Baba.

734
01:05:46,675 --> 01:05:48,635
Aren't you afraid that,
by the time he returns,

735
01:05:48,633 --> 01:05:50,843
he also may become some crazy baba.

736
01:05:52,300 --> 01:05:55,090
Yes Dear. I'm worried, for sure.
But not for Raja.

737
01:05:55,675 --> 01:05:57,635
I'm worried about that poor Paggal Baba.

738
01:05:57,633 --> 01:06:03,213
How will he tackle, Raja's unending, mind
twisting questions for one whole month.

739
01:06:04,967 --> 01:06:08,507
Uncle. I second you on this.

740
01:06:12,050 --> 01:06:18,220
With the sacred Ganges on
her forehead oh the beautiful India.

741
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:25,880
With the sacred Ganges on
her forehead oh the beautiful India.

742
01:06:30,092 --> 01:06:34,632
This very thought, gives so
much peace to the mind that we humans,

743
01:06:34,633 --> 01:06:40,003
these mountains and the rivers, the
entire nature, are all inter connected.

744
01:06:41,592 --> 01:06:45,712
There must be something,
some force that connects us all.

745
01:07:04,842 --> 01:07:07,172
The bodies of these statues
are immersed in sexual acts

746
01:07:08,383 --> 01:07:12,343
but their faces are so calm and serene.

747
01:07:18,675 --> 01:07:20,175
This must be some form of Yoga.

748
01:07:28,258 --> 01:07:32,678
Baba. After meeting the
pundits of Varanasi I feel

749
01:07:32,675 --> 01:07:35,345
that their wisdom has
lost all the life's fragrance.

750
01:07:36,133 --> 01:07:39,883
Their language, their wisdom,
is dependent on their arguments.

751
01:07:41,592 --> 01:07:44,132
It feels very odd to see wisdom
solely standing on rationality.

752
01:07:59,842 --> 01:08:02,302
It feels as if it has been
created by Mother Nature herself.

753
01:08:03,175 --> 01:08:07,215
In all these centuries that have passed,
many people, seasons

754
01:08:08,300 --> 01:08:11,840
and disasters must have
come and perished away.

755
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:14,920
But there it stands,
aloof and silently witnessing.

756
01:08:16,175 --> 01:08:17,255
Just like this moment.

757
01:08:28,175 --> 01:08:30,295
These mysterious statues
impart many secrets,

758
01:08:32,508 --> 01:08:34,428
but the heart speaks
the language of pure silence.

759
01:08:36,008 --> 01:08:37,508
I could understand some of them

760
01:08:39,342 --> 01:08:43,302
but there are many secrets
which are unfathomable.

761
01:09:01,342 --> 01:09:04,882
Baba. The ocean is so huge and endless!

762
01:09:06,092 --> 01:09:08,012
And look at the horizon.

763
01:09:09,550 --> 01:09:14,630
It feels as if the
sky is embracing the earth.

764
01:09:21,967 --> 01:09:26,257
Humans can achieve all but
cannot surpass the Mother Nature.

765
01:09:28,133 --> 01:09:31,843
Even then we never stop trying.

766
01:09:48,592 --> 01:09:49,592
Raja.

767
01:09:51,592 --> 01:09:53,632
Its time to say goodbye.

768
01:09:56,300 --> 01:10:00,300
Soon you'll meet Masto Baba,

769
01:10:02,508 --> 01:10:06,128
who'll color your life
with musical harmony.

770
01:10:07,758 --> 01:10:09,548
But Baba. How will I find him?

771
01:10:13,092 --> 01:10:14,842
He'll find you himself.

772
01:10:18,467 --> 01:10:22,177
Baba, I'll be always indebted
to you for this most holy pilgrimage.

773
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:16,970
Nani.

774
01:11:18,883 --> 01:11:22,883
When I had left this place,
the season was in full bloom.

775
01:11:24,383 --> 01:11:25,843
And now when I've come back,

776
01:11:27,383 --> 01:11:29,633
everything has a strange
smell of gloominess.

777
01:11:31,467 --> 01:11:32,967
Your journey was a very long one.

778
01:11:33,883 --> 01:11:38,713
Take a bath and have some food.
We'll talk later.

779
01:11:39,633 --> 01:11:42,133
No Nani. Bathing and
eating can be done later.

780
01:11:42,133 --> 01:11:45,423
First I have to go and meet Rajni.
I'll be back soon.

781
01:12:10,175 --> 01:12:11,795
Just a few days after you left,

782
01:12:13,383 --> 01:12:15,093
Shashi was diagnosed with common fever.

783
01:12:18,467 --> 01:12:23,387
We tried everything.
Many Doctors were consulted.

784
01:12:26,967 --> 01:12:28,587
But all in vain. We couldn't save her.

785
01:12:32,008 --> 01:12:38,548
And one evening, she also
flew away with the home bound birds.

786
01:12:42,092 --> 01:12:44,922
Even in her last moments,
she kept uttering your name.

787
01:12:46,717 --> 01:12:48,047
She said, I'll come back.

788
01:12:50,467 --> 01:12:52,637
I've to learn balancing from Raja.'

789
01:16:07,633 --> 01:16:08,633
Raja.

790
01:16:10,008 --> 01:16:11,008
Masto.

791
01:16:12,467 --> 01:16:15,047
Can I also learn to play flute,
just like you?

792
01:16:16,258 --> 01:16:20,008
You're ready, that's why I've come.

793
01:16:22,467 --> 01:16:24,087
I am unable to comprehend you Baba.

794
01:16:27,592 --> 01:16:29,512
When the student is ready,

795
01:16:31,758 --> 01:16:33,468
the teacher is bound to come.

796
01:17:59,758 --> 01:18:00,758
Raja.

797
01:18:02,300 --> 01:18:05,130
When you disappear
in the tune of your flute,

798
01:18:06,300 --> 01:18:08,170
something miraculous happens.

799
01:18:10,300 --> 01:18:15,630
My hands stop listening to
my command and I can't do anything.

800
01:18:17,258 --> 01:18:19,548
My vision gets blur

801
01:18:21,008 --> 01:18:24,218
and I lose myself
into some unknown space.

802
01:18:25,925 --> 01:18:28,295
Nani. It's the magic of Masto's flute.

803
01:18:29,592 --> 01:18:34,882
Otherwise my tunes are miniscule compared
to Masto's great mysterious compositions.

804
01:18:37,467 --> 01:18:40,717
It's been too many days
since I've met Masto Baba,

805
01:18:40,717 --> 01:18:42,757
so tomorrow I'll surly meet him.

806
01:19:18,425 --> 01:19:25,755
Some chukar's desperate
call has awakened me...

807
01:19:25,758 --> 01:19:33,178
Some chukar's desperate
call has awakened me...

808
01:19:33,175 --> 01:19:45,465
Some cuckoos call has
brought tears to my eyes...

809
01:19:45,467 --> 01:19:52,637
Some cuckoos call has
brought tears to my eyes...

810
01:20:07,675 --> 01:20:12,295
Someone is calling
from the veil of clouds...

811
01:20:18,842 --> 01:20:23,552
Someone is making me
drunk through his eyes...

812
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:41,880
Some chukar's desperate
call has awakened me...

813
01:20:57,050 --> 01:21:04,170
Some thief is cheating me into his love...

814
01:21:11,717 --> 01:21:18,967
Someone is coloring my mind in his love...

815
01:21:27,842 --> 01:21:32,672
Someone is drowning
me into meditative-ness...

816
01:21:37,675 --> 01:21:42,465
Someone is sweeping me
away into heart-full-ness...

817
01:21:53,717 --> 01:22:01,137
Some chukar's desperate
call has awakened me...

818
01:22:01,133 --> 01:22:08,213
Some cuckoos call has
brought tears to my eyes...

819
01:22:39,883 --> 01:22:42,383
I didn't know, that you sing too.

820
01:22:44,717 --> 01:22:49,717
Raja. I sing only when I am alone,
only for infinite...

821
01:22:52,092 --> 01:22:55,462
May be you're the first person,
who'd heard my song.

822
01:22:56,550 --> 01:23:00,510
Baba. It's a blessing for me.
I am the luck one.

823
01:23:01,842 --> 01:23:02,842
Raja.

824
01:23:04,633 --> 01:23:06,923
As you've mastered
the art of playing flute,

825
01:23:09,092 --> 01:23:10,512
Now the time has come,

826
01:23:11,967 --> 01:23:15,837
when you've to let go of the flute,
forever.

827
01:23:21,300 --> 01:23:25,470
Why is it so that all the things
or people I love, are taken away from me?

828
01:23:27,717 --> 01:23:32,757
Is it possible for you
to quit singing forever?

829
01:23:40,342 --> 01:23:42,422
Precisely after one week from now,

830
01:23:43,925 --> 01:23:46,465
I'll sing the last song of my life.

831
01:23:49,008 --> 01:23:52,798
And you'll play your composition
on your flute, for one last time.

832
01:24:18,008 --> 01:24:19,638
We hope that you will
keep paying us a visit.

833
01:24:19,633 --> 01:24:20,633
Yes. I will.

834
01:24:25,258 --> 01:24:30,298
I always dreamt of opening
a school for tribal children in Bastar

835
01:24:31,133 --> 01:24:32,673
and that's where I am going now.

836
01:24:33,633 --> 01:24:35,423
Since the government
has cleared my application,

837
01:24:36,300 --> 01:24:40,090
I'll name the school in memory of Shashi.

838
01:24:40,967 --> 01:24:42,887
Rajni, I'll always remember you.

839
01:24:44,175 --> 01:24:48,255
This town will always be indebted to you,

840
01:24:49,425 --> 01:24:51,505
for the treasure of books
which you've donated to our library.

841
01:25:15,758 --> 01:25:18,178
Raja dear since you've
completed your school term here,

842
01:25:21,092 --> 01:25:24,212
I've arranged for your college admission
in Jabalpur, for further studies.

843
01:25:25,425 --> 01:25:26,545
You may have to leave soon son.

844
01:25:27,842 --> 01:25:30,422
I have read all the possible
books I have got my hands on,

845
01:25:30,425 --> 01:25:32,215
but they were unable to teach me anything.

846
01:25:32,217 --> 01:25:34,337
Just wondering, what surprise will
be there in such limited books at college!

847
01:25:35,717 --> 01:25:38,257
I don't want to get into
a puzzle solving session with you.

848
01:25:38,258 --> 01:25:39,758
You have to understand clearly.

849
01:25:39,758 --> 01:25:42,548
You may not achieve anything
by studying in college,

850
01:25:43,342 --> 01:25:44,632
but a Graduate Degree, for sure.

851
01:25:45,133 --> 01:25:48,633
And that Degree alone can get you a job.

852
01:25:49,383 --> 01:25:51,593
Ok. If you insist, let's try this too.

853
01:25:52,675 --> 01:25:55,675
Anyway, I am being disconnected
with this town, slowly.

854
01:26:36,300 --> 01:26:50,010
The River...The River...O River...

855
01:26:52,092 --> 01:27:05,342
The River is thirsty...So is the Yogi.

856
01:27:25,675 --> 01:27:31,465
River is thirsty...So is the Yogi...

857
01:27:31,467 --> 01:27:36,467
The thirsty River...And the thirsty Yogi...

858
01:27:36,967 --> 01:27:45,137
Flowing together in
search of divine lover...

859
01:27:45,133 --> 01:27:53,013
Flowing together in
search of divine lover...

860
01:27:53,008 --> 01:27:58,378
River is thirsty...So is the Yogi....

861
01:28:09,383 --> 01:28:14,763
One of them flowing madly
in search of oceanic-lover...

862
01:28:14,758 --> 01:28:19,838
The other is roaming around
crazily calling for divine-lover...

863
01:28:36,592 --> 01:28:41,762
Strange is your illusive
world...No one has able to fathom it...

864
01:28:47,633 --> 01:28:52,343
Whoever dares to dive deep...has
found the supreme union...

865
01:28:58,425 --> 01:29:03,715
River is thirsty...So is the Yogi...

866
01:29:04,217 --> 01:29:09,507
The thirsty River...And the thirsty Yogi...

867
01:29:09,508 --> 01:29:17,428
Flowing together in
search of divine lover...

868
01:29:17,425 --> 01:29:23,135
River is thirsty...So is the Yogi...

869
01:29:23,133 --> 01:29:28,133
River is thirsty...So is the Yogi...

870
01:30:31,925 --> 01:30:35,135
Raja. It's time.

871
01:30:36,717 --> 01:30:41,797
Now you've to bid the final
farewell to your beloved flute.

872
01:30:44,133 --> 01:30:48,753
Whenever any musician
reaches to the peak,

873
01:30:49,967 --> 01:30:53,637
he has to let go of his instrument.

874
01:30:55,758 --> 01:31:00,878
Only then he can interpret
the hidden silence between the notes.

875
01:31:27,592 --> 01:31:29,762
I don't know why but the trinity of you,

876
01:31:29,758 --> 01:31:35,008
Magga Baba and Paggal Baba seem one to me.

877
01:31:36,217 --> 01:31:38,257
Even though your appearances
and attires are different.

878
01:31:38,258 --> 01:31:40,048
Raja. You have recognized us.

879
01:31:42,092 --> 01:31:46,922
All the travelers on the path
of truth have the same fragrance.

880
01:31:50,800 --> 01:31:56,970
Raja our journey together
has come to an end.

881
01:31:58,175 --> 01:32:02,175
Now you've to move forward alone...

882
01:32:04,425 --> 01:32:05,425
Go!

883
01:32:06,717 --> 01:32:10,427
A golden future awaits you.

884
01:32:33,758 --> 01:32:36,178
Nani. O Nani.

885
01:32:38,342 --> 01:32:39,712
What thoughts were you engrossed in?

886
01:32:42,467 --> 01:32:49,217
Son. I was thinking about your childhood.

887
01:32:50,633 --> 01:32:55,093
Can't remember when did I immerse myself
in the memories of those innumerable moments.

888
01:33:01,300 --> 01:33:02,300
But Raja.

889
01:33:05,258 --> 01:33:06,628
you have transformed.

890
01:33:08,717 --> 01:33:12,387
The glow on your face says it all.

891
01:33:16,092 --> 01:33:20,382
There is an endless peace
reflecting from your eyes.

892
01:33:22,633 --> 01:33:25,673
How and when did this happen?

893
01:33:30,717 --> 01:33:32,967
Nani. That's the reason I have to see you.

894
01:33:39,467 --> 01:33:43,507
Do you remember, when I was leaving for Jabalpur
for higher studies with a heavy heart?

895
01:33:46,050 --> 01:33:47,510
I was departing from
you for the first time.

896
01:34:07,925 --> 01:34:10,465
In Jabalpur, though I was living
quite comfortably with the family,

897
01:34:10,467 --> 01:34:14,007
father had arranged my stay with,

898
01:34:14,925 --> 01:34:17,095
my heart longed for solitude.

899
01:34:17,925 --> 01:34:22,095
So, without intimating father, I
started looking out, for a separate house.

900
01:34:38,175 --> 01:34:41,175
During this house-hunt,
I came across a property.

901
01:34:43,467 --> 01:34:46,467
It was an old but very beautiful house.

902
01:34:54,633 --> 01:34:56,673
I started searching for its owner

903
01:34:56,675 --> 01:34:59,755
and found out that it was
a Sindhi businessman, Charandas.

904
01:35:02,842 --> 01:35:04,472
Namaskar Charandasji.

905
01:35:04,467 --> 01:35:06,337
Namaskar, what do you need?

906
01:35:07,758 --> 01:35:09,178
Your house.

907
01:35:10,467 --> 01:35:13,927
Are you out of your mind?
Go away. I am busy.

908
01:35:15,217 --> 01:35:17,387
I came to know about
that haunted house of yours.

909
01:35:17,383 --> 01:35:20,133
My intention is to chase away all the
ghosts. Since you seem uninterested, so...

910
01:35:20,133 --> 01:35:23,593
Hey! What did you say?

911
01:35:24,133 --> 01:35:26,053
It's  ghosts,
we are talking about here not the bulls...

912
01:35:27,133 --> 01:35:28,463
huh, ghosts have occupied my house!

913
01:35:29,050 --> 01:35:30,840
Brother. I do chase away ghosts.

914
01:35:30,842 --> 01:35:34,342
Ghosts are not bulls that you
could chase them away with a stick.

915
01:35:34,342 --> 01:35:37,472
They are real ghosts.
The whole neighborhood is afraid of them.

916
01:35:37,467 --> 01:35:40,047
To chase away the ghosts is easy for me.

917
01:35:40,050 --> 01:35:42,340
I also came to know that lot
of your money is  stuck due to that house.

918
01:35:44,342 --> 01:35:47,922
Brother. Do you really mean business?

919
01:35:48,633 --> 01:35:52,423
How can I assure you?
You can give me a trial period.

920
01:35:53,592 --> 01:36:00,882
To, tell you the truth,
I don't care about money.

921
01:36:01,842 --> 01:36:04,802
It's about my respect.

922
01:36:04,800 --> 01:36:06,470
Whenever I step out of my residence,

923
01:36:06,467 --> 01:36:08,347
little children from the neighborhood

924
01:36:08,342 --> 01:36:10,632
start calling me names like 'ghost man',
it makes me very angry.

925
01:36:10,633 --> 01:36:12,633
What is the use of so much money,
where there is no respect?

926
01:36:13,342 --> 01:36:16,462
You don't worry.
No one is going to bother you any longer.

927
01:36:17,008 --> 01:36:19,678
Once I go there,
the ghost is bound to leave the place.

928
01:36:21,925 --> 01:36:23,885
Brother. I mean friend, here are the keys.

929
01:36:27,300 --> 01:36:30,050
By the way, what king of ghost is it?

930
01:36:30,883 --> 01:36:34,213
Sometimes in the night there
comes the sound of anklets,

931
01:36:34,217 --> 01:36:36,257
so it seems it is a female ghost.

932
01:36:36,758 --> 01:36:40,128
Other times there are sounds of shouting.
So it seems there are two ghosts.

933
01:36:41,967 --> 01:36:43,467
Will you chase them away please?

934
01:36:43,467 --> 01:36:44,757
There are two ghosts?
- Yes.

935
01:36:45,508 --> 01:36:48,218
Then I would have to
stay a little longer there.

936
01:36:48,217 --> 01:36:52,717
You stay there.
There's no problem. It's my house.

937
01:36:53,675 --> 01:36:56,465
Rice, pulses, salt... anything you need...

938
01:36:56,467 --> 01:36:57,587
Oh! No, no..

939
01:37:00,842 --> 01:37:03,212
So you understood, right?
- Ok. So I would take your leave now.

940
01:37:09,133 --> 01:37:12,423
From there I went straight to that house.

941
01:37:13,175 --> 01:37:14,845
I was happy to be there.

942
01:37:15,592 --> 01:37:19,512
I knew there was no
one to bother me there.

943
01:37:21,050 --> 01:37:25,670
As I opened the doors of the house,
I felt an overwhelming silence.

944
01:37:26,967 --> 01:37:29,927
And this is what I needed.

945
01:37:31,467 --> 01:37:33,047
There was a kind of peace in my heart.

946
01:37:34,425 --> 01:37:39,255
I picked up my bag
and made the house my own.

947
01:37:45,383 --> 01:37:48,133
Slowly, I understood
the secret of the ghost.

948
01:37:49,092 --> 01:37:51,052
That house was in an open place.

949
01:37:51,592 --> 01:37:57,722
The branches of the trees
used to make noises when winds blew.

950
01:37:57,717 --> 01:38:00,177
And people had associated
those noises with ghosts.

951
01:38:01,383 --> 01:38:03,003
I was quite happy there.

952
01:38:03,925 --> 01:38:06,425
Charandas was taking care of my food too.

953
01:38:06,967 --> 01:38:11,757
Whenever I would go to his shop, he used
to fill my bag with groceries and ration.

954
01:38:12,508 --> 01:38:14,298
I used to come out of his shop smiling.

955
01:38:17,592 --> 01:38:21,422
Few days after I started going to college,
I felt it's useless to go there

956
01:38:22,592 --> 01:38:25,302
because I was not getting
the answers to my questions.

957
01:38:26,092 --> 01:38:28,302
I had many arguments with the professors

958
01:38:28,842 --> 01:38:32,132
because they could not find
answers to my questions from the books

959
01:38:32,133 --> 01:38:33,593
that they had memorized.

960
01:38:36,008 --> 01:38:40,218
I started going to the town
library and used to read a lot.

961
01:38:40,217 --> 01:38:43,297
I would read at home too.

962
01:38:44,008 --> 01:38:47,048
I tried to understand
that ultimate secret,

963
01:38:47,050 --> 01:38:49,590
reading through all the
scriptures that man has created.

964
01:38:50,175 --> 01:38:54,255
I even read all the books
of Karl Marx and Lenin,

965
01:38:55,383 --> 01:38:58,003
but their dead words had no answers.

966
01:39:41,883 --> 01:39:52,633
So mysterious is your world...Your universe...

967
01:39:58,467 --> 01:40:02,047
My madness was growing,
as were my questions.

968
01:40:03,300 --> 01:40:06,380
Sometimes I would go
to Sufis to seek my answers,

969
01:40:06,967 --> 01:40:09,837
and sometimes I would move
along with the groups of Sadhus.

970
01:40:10,967 --> 01:40:13,297
Sometimes I would ask
the blank walls of a church.

971
01:40:14,175 --> 01:40:19,385
The statues of Buddha and
Mahavira answered only in silence.

972
01:40:20,883 --> 01:40:25,053
Slowly, one by one,
my questions started returning back to me.

973
01:40:36,883 --> 01:40:39,423
It felt like the answer
is somewhere close by,

974
01:40:39,425 --> 01:40:41,005
just eluding my comprehension.

975
01:40:41,842 --> 01:40:43,922
Time had stopped its journey;
night and day seemed to be the same.

976
01:40:44,467 --> 01:40:50,927
Only I was moving,
wandering in my thoughts.

977
01:40:52,342 --> 01:40:56,012
The (W)s had lost their
existence and I hardly saw them.

978
01:40:59,425 --> 01:41:02,715
So my father was informed.

979
01:41:02,717 --> 01:41:07,297
This transformation of
mine obviously worried him.

980
01:41:07,925 --> 01:41:09,845
He took me to an Ayurveda practitioner.

981
01:41:09,842 --> 01:41:12,552
He examined me and smiled at me.

982
01:41:12,550 --> 01:41:15,800
But for my father's satisfaction,

983
01:41:15,800 --> 01:41:18,430
he handed over sweet white
globules called medicines, to me.

984
01:41:18,425 --> 01:41:21,295
My good father warned
me amply and returned home.

985
01:41:29,550 --> 01:41:31,300
I lost hopes.

986
01:41:31,925 --> 01:41:33,635
The impediment took over me.

987
01:41:34,175 --> 01:41:37,465
It even made me think to end this life.

988
01:41:37,467 --> 01:41:40,047
In dismay, I banged my head to the walls

989
01:41:41,383 --> 01:41:44,423
and stared at the ceiling. I was so empty.

990
01:41:45,758 --> 01:41:47,758
A weekpassed but nothing helped.

991
01:41:49,425 --> 01:41:54,885
But that night, at midnight,
universe kept expanding until the time

992
01:41:55,675 --> 01:41:57,555
I felt some unseen force was pulling me,

993
01:41:57,550 --> 01:42:00,680
as if the open sky wants me to accept the
baffling, hidden dimensions of my life.

994
01:42:00,675 --> 01:42:06,255
I walked as if I was intoxicated.

995
01:42:09,508 --> 01:42:14,798
The confusing whirls of answers were clear.
That beautiful night was a bright day.

996
01:42:16,217 --> 01:42:19,837
Every step, urged me to walk more.

997
01:42:20,967 --> 01:42:24,887
It grew as if the cosmos was a magnet.

998
01:42:25,675 --> 01:42:29,465
Neither didI stop nor
did the force give up pulling me.

999
01:42:31,633 --> 01:42:36,343
Then, I finally stopped.

1000
01:43:37,967 --> 01:43:43,507
At dawn, I reached home after
sitting for hours under a tree.

1001
01:43:44,717 --> 01:43:47,257
I realized to be in our
world we have to embrace mystery.

1002
01:43:47,925 --> 01:43:53,715
The books, the walls, everything in
that room were new like me, transformed.

1003
01:43:54,383 --> 01:44:07,923
They gazed at each other with happiness
and I reciprocated with a smile.

1004
01:44:10,050 --> 01:44:11,630
It continued for hours.

1005
01:44:15,467 --> 01:44:18,467
Nani. I wanted to share this
priceless treasure with you.

1006
01:44:18,467 --> 01:44:20,837
And I came to meet you.

1007
01:44:23,592 --> 01:44:42,552
I need your permission before I set
out to share this wisdom with everyone.

1008
01:44:45,008 --> 01:44:48,628
Raja. You were only my Raja till now.

1009
01:44:49,550 --> 01:44:51,630
But now you belong to the world.

1010
01:44:55,342 --> 01:45:01,512
Go and shower your bliss
and wisdom over whole world.

1011
01:45:05,425 --> 01:45:08,965
But first of all,
I will become your disciple.

1012
01:45:13,883 --> 01:45:15,503
Initiate me, Raja.

1013
01:45:20,092 --> 01:45:25,592
I need your blessings
before I initiate you.

1014
01:46:52,467 --> 01:46:59,337
I'm here to enlighten
you and not teach you

1015
01:47:06,800 --> 01:47:12,470
Lord! Your creations are so wonderful

1016
01:47:12,467 --> 01:47:15,927
The entire universe
is so full of mysteries.

1017
01:47:28,092 --> 01:47:33,672
The incredible difference of scale between
the tiny world we live in every day.

1018
01:47:33,675 --> 01:47:36,965
The vastness of all time and space

1019
01:47:39,050 --> 01:47:43,920
Oh creator! You are an illusion
but true origin of our universe

1020
01:47:44,425 --> 01:47:47,845
You are visibly invisible and
at times your invisibility is divine

1021
01:47:50,133 --> 01:47:55,513
Solve the riddle...O seeker...Solve it...

1022
01:47:55,508 --> 01:48:00,588
Solve the riddle...O seeker...Solve it...

1023
01:48:10,883 --> 01:48:16,303
Your ways are thousands...But
your home is one...

1024
01:48:16,300 --> 01:48:21,510
Your cups are unaccountable...Yet
your wine is one...

1025
01:48:37,633 --> 01:48:43,173
O wine server...Your steps
are so full of turn and twist...

1026
01:48:43,175 --> 01:48:46,135
Somewhere you are in
tavern...and somewhere in temple...

1027
01:48:59,467 --> 01:49:04,717
Drown in...O lover...Drown in......

1028
01:49:04,717 --> 01:49:09,337
Drown in...O lover...Drown in......

1029
01:49:10,175 --> 01:49:12,465
Drown in...O lover...Drown in......
