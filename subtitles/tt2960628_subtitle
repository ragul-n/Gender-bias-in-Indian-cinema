1
00:01:01,767 --> 00:01:03,615
Hey...Come here. Come. Come.

2
00:01:04,432 --> 00:01:07,764
Hey...Come here. Come. Come. Come here.

3
00:01:07,844 --> 00:01:09,158
Come. Come. Come.

4
00:01:19,364 --> 00:01:23,418
Come. Come. Come.

5
00:01:24,489 --> 00:01:26,835
Take it. Rise. Rise.

6
00:01:28,835 --> 00:01:30,917
Get it. Take it.

7
00:01:32,371 --> 00:01:33,243
Take it.

8
00:01:35,623 --> 00:01:38,564
I've got it for you. So why are you so impatient?

9
00:01:38,644 --> 00:01:41,117
Your hunger is insatiable.

10
00:01:41,581 --> 00:01:43,926
You won't be able to even walk if you grow fat.

11
00:01:44,412 --> 00:01:46,128
Take it. Grab. Grab.

12
00:01:47,269 --> 00:01:49,753
You got it. Come again tomorrow.

13
00:02:03,367 --> 00:02:06,411
What's this? Clouds are gathering in the sky.

14
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:08,962
Looks like it's going to rain.

15
00:02:19,409 --> 00:02:21,545
I've caught enough fish.

16
00:02:21,626 --> 00:02:23,206
Now let's go home, Ramu.

17
00:05:09,663 --> 00:05:11,644
Oh no. I'm really late.

18
00:05:11,723 --> 00:05:13,891
It's pertinent that I wear the school's shirt.

19
00:05:13,971 --> 00:05:16,495
Otherwise mother will feel I just didn't go to school.

20
00:05:21,209 --> 00:05:23,509
What's this? You've returned very soon.

21
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:27,055
Yes, uncle. I got a few fishes. So I returned.

22
00:05:52,889 --> 00:05:54,274
One cup strong tea.

23
00:05:54,353 --> 00:05:55,838
He is here to listen to the songs.

24
00:05:55,918 --> 00:05:58,995
His radio never plays good songs.

25
00:05:59,867 --> 00:06:02,375
It always plays sad songs. Turn it off.

26
00:06:02,584 --> 00:06:04,539
I'll sing a good song for all of you. Here goes.

27
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:09,227
"Throw the net. Catch some fish. Catch some fish."

28
00:06:09,307 --> 00:06:13,387
"The big fish eats the small fish. This is unfair."

29
00:06:13,466 --> 00:06:15,031
"This is injustice."

30
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:18,947
"Why do your own kind pose a threat to you? Tell me."

31
00:06:19,028 --> 00:06:21,015
This too was a fishy sad song.

32
00:06:21,095 --> 00:06:23,021
Listen to this. - Yes. Go ahead. Try your luck.

33
00:06:24,146 --> 00:06:32,266
"The young man who lays his life for his country will be immortal"

34
00:06:32,803 --> 00:06:39,904
"This story will be told till the end of the world."

35
00:06:39,985 --> 00:06:41,306
Wow.

36
00:06:46,146 --> 00:06:47,211
Come, Gajanan. Come.

37
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:48,569
Where are you off to early morning?

38
00:06:48,649 --> 00:06:49,909
Have some tea with us. - Come on keep singing.

39
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:53,555
Sing songs. All you do is catch fish. - Keep singing.

40
00:06:53,634 --> 00:06:57,921
Do you have anything else to do? I see you singing all the time.

41
00:06:58,002 --> 00:07:01,338
Or having tea. - You certainly can have a cup of tea.

42
00:07:01,418 --> 00:07:03,884
No way. I have to go to the sea.

43
00:07:04,122 --> 00:07:05,782
You guys carry on with your tea.

44
00:07:06,107 --> 00:07:08,481
Who's going to go into the sea now? Clouds have gathered.

45
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,649
Wind is blowing hard.

46
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:12,598
Storm or rains can't do any harm to Gajanan.

47
00:07:12,677 --> 00:07:17,524
I'm a warrior. The mighty warrior.

48
00:07:18,375 --> 00:07:21,779
Go. But do inform your family. We'll come to perform the final rites.

49
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:23,703
The wind is blowing hard. And he is off to the sea.

50
00:07:23,783 --> 00:07:26,215
Winds scare you.

51
00:07:26,295 --> 00:07:29,487
It's a matter of shame for me to be afraid of storm or tornado.

52
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:32,532
I can cover the moon with leaves.

53
00:07:32,612 --> 00:07:35,611
I can stop death with my bare hands. Got it?

54
00:07:36,425 --> 00:07:38,757
Great. So you have decided to die, right?

55
00:07:38,838 --> 00:07:39,644
So go die.

56
00:07:39,723 --> 00:07:42,591
We'll arrange song and dance as well for your funeral. Right?

57
00:08:08,531 --> 00:08:11,603
Bansi. Bansi. Bansi

58
00:08:12,785 --> 00:08:15,677
Who is it? Is it you Gajanan? Come.

59
00:08:15,757 --> 00:08:17,288
Were you sound asleep?

60
00:08:17,483 --> 00:08:18,915
I had no work to do.

61
00:08:19,149 --> 00:08:22,166
I gorged on rice and fish in the afternoon.

62
00:08:22,247 --> 00:08:24,830
And then went to sleep.

63
00:08:25,603 --> 00:08:27,707
Tell me. Where are you off to?

64
00:08:29,139 --> 00:08:31,665
Of course. To catch fish.

65
00:08:31,892 --> 00:08:34,701
Come with me. - But look at the sky.

66
00:08:35,035 --> 00:08:38,072
Dark clouds have gathered. A terrible storm is expected.

67
00:08:38,151 --> 00:08:41,793
They announced it on radio too. - Is it? On the radio?

68
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:44,471
Then this news will turn out to be 100% wrong.

69
00:08:44,551 --> 00:08:46,603
Today no one's gone to catch fish.

70
00:08:46,837 --> 00:08:49,404
Even guys with motorboat haven't ventured into the sea out of fear.

71
00:08:49,485 --> 00:08:53,009
Why should we go to die? - Relax. Come on.

72
00:08:53,548 --> 00:08:55,333
Do you think I'm stupid like you?

73
00:08:55,513 --> 00:08:57,638
You're used to risking your life.

74
00:08:57,717 --> 00:09:00,453
I'll not come in such bad weather. You go.

75
00:09:00,889 --> 00:09:03,116
Come if you want to. Or go to hell.

76
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:05,337
Idiot. - Go. Go.

77
00:09:05,418 --> 00:09:08,616
You'll realise once you venture out into the sea.

78
00:10:10,206 --> 00:10:12,649
Kamla, it's raining. Get the clothes.

79
00:10:13,057 --> 00:10:15,494
It has started to rain. Run.

80
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:17,631
It has started to rain. Looks like a storm too is coming.

81
00:10:17,711 --> 00:10:19,703
Run. - Run.

82
00:10:19,783 --> 00:10:23,013
Come fast. Looks like a storm too is coming.

83
00:10:23,092 --> 00:10:26,418
Run. Run. Fast.

84
00:10:26,871 --> 00:10:29,823
Hurry up. Run. Come on.

85
00:11:09,469 --> 00:11:15,403
I'm out of breath. Oh God. Good Lord. This storm.

86
00:11:49,086 --> 00:11:52,399
Those morons stopped me from coming here.

87
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,037
But I didn't listen and came.

88
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:59,716
I knew that a terrible storm is coming.

89
00:11:59,796 --> 00:12:01,843
I deserve a sound thrashing.

90
00:12:37,317 --> 00:12:39,028
Oh my God. What's that?

91
00:12:39,109 --> 00:12:41,901
A terrifying ghost like creature is heading for the village.

92
00:12:42,687 --> 00:12:44,607
If it gets into the village it would be disaster will strike.

93
00:12:44,687 --> 00:12:47,824
I must get to the village and alert the villagers.

94
00:12:47,904 --> 00:12:49,744
Or else there will be destruction.

95
00:13:21,274 --> 00:13:24,615
"Don't be afraid of hard work."

96
00:13:24,696 --> 00:13:27,870
"Hard work is the door to happiness."

97
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:30,973
"Hard work makes like successful."

98
00:13:31,052 --> 00:13:34,086
"I am not boasting. I'm not boasting."

99
00:13:34,167 --> 00:13:36,595
"I make my life successful."

100
00:13:37,135 --> 00:13:40,141
"Don't be afraid of hard work."

101
00:13:40,221 --> 00:13:43,250
"Hard work is the door to happiness."

102
00:13:43,331 --> 00:13:46,461
"Hard work makes like successful."

103
00:13:46,542 --> 00:13:49,586
"Don't be afraid of hard work."

104
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:52,689
"Hard work is the door to happiness."

105
00:13:53,315 --> 00:13:56,245
See. These kids keep singing and dancing all the time.

106
00:13:56,325 --> 00:13:58,655
Ever since Swami has come to our village..

107
00:13:58,735 --> 00:14:01,293
..singing and dancing happens all day.

108
00:14:01,374 --> 00:14:03,336
He'll spoil the kids of the village.

109
00:14:03,417 --> 00:14:05,780
See. He keep playing with them all the time.

110
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:07,293
My kid is also in also with him.

111
00:14:07,374 --> 00:14:09,413
This is the limit. Got it?

112
00:14:12,211 --> 00:14:13,735
Run.

113
00:14:58,019 --> 00:15:00,419
One strong tea please. - Okay.

114
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:05,221
Go easy on the milk and sugar. We need to earn money.

115
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:06,931
Make it extra sweet.

116
00:15:07,082 --> 00:15:09,981
This is all you get for the money you pay.

117
00:15:12,153 --> 00:15:15,135
They'll order a tea and throw a thousand tantrums.

118
00:15:15,628 --> 00:15:17,275
Kid, give him tea.

119
00:15:17,355 --> 00:15:20,485
Money makes you arrogant.

120
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:24,769
Here comes the king of fishermen.

121
00:15:24,849 --> 00:15:27,107
The mighty warrior Ganjanan.

122
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:29,943
What news do you have today?

123
00:15:30,024 --> 00:15:34,121
Did all the fish jump into your boat afraid of the storm?

124
00:15:35,216 --> 00:15:38,239
Are you sneezing and dancing? Or dancing and sneezing?

125
00:15:39,477 --> 00:15:43,247
You'll also dance if I tell you what I saw early morning.

126
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:45,330
You'll also dance.

127
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:47,412
Whether I dance or don't you tell us the story.

128
00:15:47,493 --> 00:15:52,471
There is a terrible storm at night when I ventured into the sea.

129
00:15:52,942 --> 00:15:55,778
The waves picked up pace. I was dumbfounded.

130
00:15:55,857 --> 00:15:58,635
I started wondering what was going to happen.

131
00:15:58,716 --> 00:16:01,479
I didn't get afraid at all. But I did get a shock.

132
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:04,931
I somehow got to the shore and discarded the boat.

133
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:07,865
And a creature came out of the sea.

134
00:16:07,945 --> 00:16:10,986
Like a ghost. Long and black.

135
00:16:11,546 --> 00:16:14,258
How long would it be? - Around 40 feet.

136
00:16:14,337 --> 00:16:16,401
And as thick as that tree trunk.

137
00:16:16,481 --> 00:16:19,197
Stop exaggerating.

138
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:22,672
I told you what I saw. Whether you believe or no.

139
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:25,107
He is just making up stories.

140
00:16:25,187 --> 00:16:27,176
When you are scared you overestimate things.

141
00:16:27,255 --> 00:16:30,177
You see ghosts in the dark. - It was a ghost.

142
00:17:15,873 --> 00:17:17,754
Give me the tea. - Right away.

143
00:17:17,834 --> 00:17:19,754
Come on. I've to go. - Hold on.

144
00:17:23,855 --> 00:17:26,449
Are you done with the chores? - Not yet.

145
00:17:26,528 --> 00:17:28,603
Once I take the water back I'll to wash the clothes.

146
00:17:28,682 --> 00:17:31,612
Water is scarce these days.

147
00:17:31,949 --> 00:17:33,366
She has been down with fever since the past two days.

148
00:17:33,446 --> 00:17:34,888
What? The fever hasn't subsided yet.

149
00:17:34,969 --> 00:17:37,120
She was saying that she has been given the medicine.

150
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,866
No. She is still not alright.

151
00:17:48,703 --> 00:17:51,134
Where is Ramu? - He went to school.

152
00:17:51,859 --> 00:17:53,291
You see. He didn't take this tiffin with him.

153
00:17:53,372 --> 00:17:55,938
He must be on the way. Hurry up. Go.

154
00:18:00,088 --> 00:18:01,134
Ramu.

155
00:18:01,296 --> 00:18:02,331
Ramu.

156
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:05,148
Ramu.

157
00:18:07,694 --> 00:18:08,812
Ramu.

158
00:18:09,038 --> 00:18:09,920
What is it?

159
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:11,093
Oh no. Mother is watching.

160
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:13,556
Come here. Behind the tree. - What's all this?

161
00:18:13,855 --> 00:18:15,527
Where are you taking them? Tell me.

162
00:18:16,107 --> 00:18:18,038
School. - With it?

163
00:18:18,118 --> 00:18:19,423
Why? What's the harm?

164
00:18:19,673 --> 00:18:23,016
Your teacher was saying that you've been not attending school for a while now.

165
00:18:23,262 --> 00:18:25,963
If you study well you'll be able to earn some money.

166
00:18:26,044 --> 00:18:27,153
Where are you going? Tell me.

167
00:18:27,365 --> 00:18:32,157
I have to go to a village without school.

168
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:37,516
I've to return with the treasure of experience.

169
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:40,920
Get out of here. Stop singing. Moron.

170
00:18:41,252 --> 00:18:45,308
If you study hard, you can become a doctor or an engineer.

171
00:18:45,388 --> 00:18:47,954
You can buy a car. You can travel. - Otherwise?

172
00:18:48,121 --> 00:18:51,009
You'll have to go to the jungle. Gather wood. You'll eat simple food.

173
00:18:51,186 --> 00:18:55,083
First I'll take the path that gives me food.

174
00:18:55,321 --> 00:18:58,376
You are talking like the elders of the village.

175
00:18:58,836 --> 00:19:00,995
Of course. Our father's no more.

176
00:19:01,542 --> 00:19:02,981
I'm the only man in the house.

177
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:05,943
I might be a kid but I'm a man.

178
00:19:06,023 --> 00:19:07,115
Is it?

179
00:19:07,913 --> 00:19:10,498
Then take up the path which gives us food.

180
00:19:13,326 --> 00:19:16,576
The lake outside the village with lotus.

181
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:19,875
I promise I'll catch fish for you every day.

182
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:26,793
The lake outside the village with lotus.

183
00:19:26,873 --> 00:19:29,498
He is very stubborn. He just doesn't listen. Idiot.

184
00:19:29,577 --> 00:19:32,196
He left the tiffin box again.

185
00:19:32,653 --> 00:19:35,670
The lake outside the village with lotus.

186
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:39,702
I promise I'll catch fish for you every day.

187
00:19:46,824 --> 00:19:50,027
Aunt. Aunt.

188
00:19:50,234 --> 00:19:52,185
Fill water quickly. Let others also fill water.

189
00:19:52,266 --> 00:19:53,598
I'm in a bit of a hurry.

190
00:19:53,678 --> 00:19:56,856
You're pulling the rope slowly. Won't you let me go home, old woman?

191
00:20:01,055 --> 00:20:04,451
Sister, these days, youngsters don't give any respect to elders.

192
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:07,711
Elders have to listen to youngsters.

193
00:20:11,517 --> 00:20:13,468
Times have changed and how.

194
00:20:15,259 --> 00:20:18,152
The youngsters find the elders amusing.

195
00:20:18,503 --> 00:20:20,959
You're absolutely right.

196
00:20:23,182 --> 00:20:25,022
Just keep blabbering.

197
00:20:25,103 --> 00:20:28,150
Do you even know what's happening in the village?

198
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:30,585
What's happening?

199
00:20:30,952 --> 00:20:34,412
A very big ghost 55 feet long came out of the sea..

200
00:20:34,491 --> 00:20:35,982
..and got into the village.

201
00:20:37,712 --> 00:20:38,903
Not 55.

202
00:20:40,417 --> 00:20:42,279
Everyone says it's 45 feet.

203
00:20:42,536 --> 00:20:44,299
Little do you know.

204
00:20:44,444 --> 00:20:47,662
It's neither 55 nor 45.

205
00:20:47,741 --> 00:20:51,751
It is 50 feet long. This long. Got it?

206
00:20:52,527 --> 00:20:56,111
Yes. Everyone claims to have seen the ghost.

207
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:59,821
If you ask them to describe the ghost they change the topic.

208
00:20:59,901 --> 00:21:05,673
In the days gone by, there used to be ghosts and spirits.

209
00:21:05,753 --> 00:21:08,822
During the times of our grandparents you could even see them.

210
00:21:09,141 --> 00:21:13,459
Radha, you are educated. You also say something.

211
00:21:14,795 --> 00:21:17,881
They said a horrific ghost came out of the sea.

212
00:21:18,448 --> 00:21:21,132
It must not be a ghost but an animal.

213
00:21:21,211 --> 00:21:24,377
But why? Why did it come out of it?

214
00:21:24,834 --> 00:21:26,149
I don't understand.

215
00:21:26,605 --> 00:21:31,925
Even if it has come it must have gone towards a lake or pond.

216
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:34,860
Whatever the case. I hope it doesn't jump into this well.

217
00:21:39,019 --> 00:21:42,554
Give me a bucket of water. - Get lost. Lazy bones.

218
00:21:43,799 --> 00:21:47,384
'I'll have to stop Ramu from going to the lake. But how do I?'

219
00:21:47,463 --> 00:21:49,002
'He just doesn't listen to me.'

220
00:22:37,818 --> 00:22:39,762
You've got a big fish, son.

221
00:23:29,201 --> 00:23:30,219
Darn it.

222
00:23:37,662 --> 00:23:39,944
I had imagined I will catch a few fishes and go home.

223
00:23:40,025 --> 00:23:41,786
The monster broke the rod.

224
00:23:43,425 --> 00:23:46,545
I did all the hard work I could. But only if luck would be on side.

225
00:23:49,832 --> 00:23:52,434
Who the hell are you? You're quite large.

226
00:23:54,143 --> 00:23:56,156
I'll take pity on you and spare you.

227
00:23:56,237 --> 00:23:59,575
But if it had been other kids they would've made minced meat of you.

228
00:24:01,726 --> 00:24:04,355
If you're brave then come out. Let's have a fight.

229
00:24:47,065 --> 00:24:50,303
You like small fish, don't you? Here. Take it.

230
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:58,797
Eat. Eat this. Come on. Come on.

231
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:09,390
You want more?

232
00:25:09,743 --> 00:25:11,293
Look at your face.

233
00:25:16,593 --> 00:25:18,086
Here. Grab it.

234
00:25:21,358 --> 00:25:23,144
This is the last fish. Here.

235
00:25:26,134 --> 00:25:28,126
Go. Come on. Go.

236
00:26:14,876 --> 00:26:16,529
"The small world of the village."

237
00:26:16,609 --> 00:26:18,218
"The people are innocent."

238
00:26:18,398 --> 00:26:20,148
"Few desires is the key to happiness."

239
00:26:20,229 --> 00:26:21,920
"Our cup is full to the brim with happiness."

240
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,580
"We are unique."

241
00:26:23,816 --> 00:26:25,469
"The small world of the village."

242
00:26:25,548 --> 00:26:26,480
Gosh!

243
00:26:27,525 --> 00:26:30,057
Mr. Snake, how are you?

244
00:26:31,959 --> 00:26:35,640
You think I'll also get scared upon seeing you like others.

245
00:26:36,413 --> 00:26:38,655
But I don't get scared even in dreams.

246
00:26:46,287 --> 00:26:49,317
Everyone says you attack the eyes.

247
00:26:49,397 --> 00:26:52,112
But I know that you don't even bite.

248
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:57,247
Go. Yes. Go. Go.

249
00:26:57,731 --> 00:26:59,454
See you again. Go.

250
00:27:02,657 --> 00:27:03,771
I'll come tomorrow.

251
00:27:03,852 --> 00:27:08,137
Come. Fast. Surround it.

252
00:27:08,217 --> 00:27:09,687
Come. Fast.

253
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:13,061
Surround it.

254
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:15,794
Beat it. Hard.

255
00:27:15,954 --> 00:27:18,666
Beat it. Hard.

256
00:27:19,752 --> 00:27:23,461
Beat it. Beat it. Hurl a stone at it.

257
00:27:23,732 --> 00:27:26,693
Come on. Beat it. Hard.

258
00:27:27,848 --> 00:27:29,461
Hurl a stone at it.

259
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:30,733
Hey...what are you doing?

260
00:27:30,814 --> 00:27:34,682
So the king of the jungle is here to catch the venomous lizard.

261
00:27:34,762 --> 00:27:37,326
This lizard isn't venomous.

262
00:27:37,711 --> 00:27:39,151
Why are you beating it?

263
00:27:39,309 --> 00:27:42,907
My father's back is hurting. If he eats it he'll be fine.

264
00:27:43,329 --> 00:27:47,176
You fool. Is your father going to have insects for back pain?

265
00:27:47,662 --> 00:27:49,025
Villagers say that it's a bad omen..

266
00:27:49,105 --> 00:27:51,958
..if poisonous animals like these stay in the village.

267
00:27:52,228 --> 00:27:54,484
Ramu, you claim to be very brave, don't you?

268
00:27:54,564 --> 00:27:56,816
Catch the lizard alive if you have the guts.

269
00:27:57,029 --> 00:27:58,593
I'll catch it right away.

270
00:28:10,565 --> 00:28:12,287
Give me the lizard.

271
00:28:12,854 --> 00:28:14,168
I'll not give it to you.

272
00:28:14,673 --> 00:28:17,393
Our hard work has gone to waste. He took the lizard.

273
00:28:17,472 --> 00:28:18,826
It wasn't in our destiny.

274
00:28:18,905 --> 00:28:20,741
Ramu is very brave.

275
00:28:23,854 --> 00:28:27,680
Go. Go. Come on. Go from here. Get lost.

276
00:28:30,032 --> 00:28:31,325
You caught the lizard alright.

277
00:28:31,657 --> 00:28:34,618
Will you be able to catch the ghost which came out of the sea?

278
00:28:34,699 --> 00:28:35,663
Ghost?

279
00:28:36,327 --> 00:28:38,050
Didn't you hear?

280
00:28:38,131 --> 00:28:41,213
When father came to the shore with the fishes this morning..

281
00:28:41,292 --> 00:28:43,496
..he saw a large ghost coming out of the sea.

282
00:28:43,576 --> 00:28:45,260
And it went straight towards the jungle.

283
00:28:45,613 --> 00:28:48,380
Towards the lake where you catch fish.

284
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:51,038
Go catch the ghost. It will bring you down to mother earth.

285
00:28:52,939 --> 00:28:54,461
I'll catch it as well.

286
00:28:55,209 --> 00:28:58,951
Is it this ghost which broke the fishing rod at the lake?

287
00:29:08,847 --> 00:29:10,992
Ramu, did they leave you early from school?

288
00:29:11,073 --> 00:29:13,165
Yes. They left us early today.

289
00:29:13,244 --> 00:29:14,589
Such are the times.

290
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:17,759
The school opens for two days. And then closes for the next two days.

291
00:29:31,738 --> 00:29:33,653
Ramu, come sit. Have food.

292
00:29:44,698 --> 00:29:46,891
Oh. Fish. Curry - Yes.

293
00:29:47,339 --> 00:29:49,262
Did you wash your hands? - Yes.

294
00:29:49,343 --> 00:29:50,649
When? - Yesterday.

295
00:29:50,729 --> 00:29:51,838
I'll whack you.

296
00:30:09,329 --> 00:30:11,245
Why do you look pretty tired today?

297
00:30:17,625 --> 00:30:21,195
Indeed. I read lots of books in school today.

298
00:30:25,001 --> 00:30:27,375
Wait. I'll get some more fish.

299
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:41,357
I'm sure it's a crocodile.

300
00:30:41,835 --> 00:30:44,437
Since it's a crocodile how big does it grow?

301
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,048
What does it do?

302
00:30:46,128 --> 00:30:48,276
Swami must have the answers to this.

303
00:30:49,349 --> 00:30:52,538
Mother. Mother. I can hear the pot.

304
00:30:52,618 --> 00:30:55,118
I guess Swami is back. I'll go meet him.

305
00:30:55,199 --> 00:30:57,278
It's late. Go to sleep. Go meet him in the morning.

306
00:30:57,358 --> 00:30:58,378
I'll be right back.

307
00:30:58,459 --> 00:31:00,517
Why do you have to meet him? Are you going to play the pot?

308
00:31:00,596 --> 00:31:01,956
Yes. I will play the pot.

309
00:31:02,037 --> 00:31:03,983
Come back soon.

310
00:31:04,163 --> 00:31:06,481
The Swami has driven the kids crazy.

311
00:31:06,561 --> 00:31:08,667
And the kids have driven Swami crazy.

312
00:31:08,862 --> 00:31:12,100
Look at him. He wanders around in the entire village.

313
00:31:41,457 --> 00:31:42,910
Where is he?

314
00:31:45,034 --> 00:31:46,445
Got scared?

315
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,509
Seeing kids give me great pleasure.

316
00:31:50,207 --> 00:31:51,771
You just don't come to me these days.

317
00:31:51,851 --> 00:31:54,082
You are always busy with your trips.

318
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:56,578
I didn't come as I thought who knows I might not be able to meet you.

319
00:31:59,381 --> 00:32:02,923
Sir, have you read anything about wild animals?

320
00:32:03,566 --> 00:32:06,125
Yes. Quite a bit. And seen too.

321
00:32:06,659 --> 00:32:10,624
Before coming to this village I've been to all the jungles of this country.

322
00:32:10,998 --> 00:32:13,143
The jungles used to be really dense then.

323
00:32:26,836 --> 00:32:29,174
Sir. Sir, have you seen a crocodile as well?

324
00:32:29,609 --> 00:32:31,207
I have seen innumerable crocodiles.

325
00:32:31,402 --> 00:32:32,253
In lakes.

326
00:32:33,394 --> 00:32:34,377
In seas.

327
00:32:35,104 --> 00:32:36,121
In ponds.

328
00:32:36,958 --> 00:32:41,373
You must have heard about the Ganges. - I have.

329
00:32:41,803 --> 00:32:45,463
People have dirtied it by throwing dead bodies and rubble into it.

330
00:32:45,759 --> 00:32:48,756
I was playing the pot at the banks of the Ganges one day.

331
00:32:56,229 --> 00:32:59,958
A creature which had a ball like thing on its nose came towards me.

332
00:33:00,691 --> 00:33:04,461
It was a male crocodile. It is also called Ghariyal.

333
00:33:05,292 --> 00:33:07,077
He was having fish and how.

334
00:33:07,381 --> 00:33:11,360
He had such a long snout. And his teeth were mighty sharp.

335
00:33:11,858 --> 00:33:13,532
It doesn't harm humans.

336
00:33:13,613 --> 00:33:16,509
But humans kill it mercilessly.

337
00:33:17,358 --> 00:33:20,963
Does it eat kids like me as well? - Not at all.

338
00:33:21,212 --> 00:33:24,603
"Humans are killing each other."

339
00:33:24,682 --> 00:33:28,228
"Let the atrocity end now."

340
00:33:28,307 --> 00:33:32,551
"Chant the mantra of love. This is my desire."

341
00:33:32,711 --> 00:33:35,970
"Humans are killing each other."

342
00:33:36,049 --> 00:33:39,581
"Let the atrocity end now."

343
00:33:39,662 --> 00:33:43,575
"Chant the mantra of love. This is my desire."

344
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:46,944
Okay. He doesn't eat kids. But why did it come towards you?

345
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:50,713
Its eggs must be around. That's why it came towards me.

346
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:53,325
It just doesn't clash with humans without reason.

347
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:56,576
But they do clash with each other.

348
00:33:56,656 --> 00:33:58,884
So did it bite you?

349
00:33:59,568 --> 00:34:01,402
Why would it bite me?

350
00:34:01,481 --> 00:34:03,738
I didn't mess with me. Nor did I stay there.

351
00:34:03,989 --> 00:34:06,912
But I had a more unique experience than this.

352
00:34:07,809 --> 00:34:14,780
A huge crocodile lived in salt water in a jungle in Kolkata.

353
00:34:14,861 --> 00:34:16,609
In salt water? - Yes.

354
00:34:17,941 --> 00:34:20,155
But not in the sea.

355
00:34:20,449 --> 00:34:24,012
In the waters where the sea meets the ocean.

356
00:34:24,092 --> 00:34:25,144
Okay.

357
00:34:25,586 --> 00:34:30,889
Once its nest was near to where I was staying.

358
00:34:34,184 --> 00:34:37,332
Why? Do crocodiles too make nests like crows?

359
00:34:38,023 --> 00:34:40,540
Is only a nest on the tree a nest?

360
00:34:40,938 --> 00:34:45,090
The crocodile digs a pit in the earth and makes a nest for its eggs.

361
00:34:45,306 --> 00:34:47,001
Then? - Then my foot.

362
00:34:47,081 --> 00:34:48,662
Please tell me.

363
00:34:48,851 --> 00:34:51,195
She laid eggs very near to my house.

364
00:34:51,275 --> 00:34:53,348
And I went there to see them.

365
00:34:55,657 --> 00:34:59,635
As soon as I got to the pit with the eggs, disaster struck.

366
00:34:59,715 --> 00:35:01,650
The crocodile lunged at me.

367
00:35:01,731 --> 00:35:04,453
And I ran for my life.

368
00:35:05,291 --> 00:35:06,571
I got away.

369
00:35:07,773 --> 00:35:10,844
Crocodiles were found all over India for many years.

370
00:35:11,016 --> 00:35:13,195
But now their numbers are dwindling.

371
00:35:15,186 --> 00:35:17,815
Today the numbers of animals are decreasing..

372
00:35:17,894 --> 00:35:20,530
..and the numbers of humans are increasing.

373
00:35:25,192 --> 00:35:27,077
Now go. It's quite late.

374
00:35:27,157 --> 00:35:29,394
No. Tell me something else about crocodiles.

375
00:35:29,474 --> 00:35:31,971
Sister and mother might be worrying.

376
00:35:32,585 --> 00:35:34,202
I'll tell some other day.

377
00:35:34,402 --> 00:35:36,347
No. Tell me about crocodile.

378
00:35:36,427 --> 00:35:39,739
Do you wish to raise a crocodile? - No. It's not that.

379
00:35:40,077 --> 00:35:41,175
He got scared.

380
00:38:10,675 --> 00:38:14,557
Where did all the fishes go? Did the birds eat them?

381
00:38:15,768 --> 00:38:17,235
Who must have taken them?

382
00:38:17,554 --> 00:38:21,718
I dozed off for a second. What do I do now?

383
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:25,115
Oh no.

384
00:38:26,769 --> 00:38:28,402
What do I tell at home?

385
00:38:28,956 --> 00:38:31,737
Sister said she would make fish fritters.

386
00:38:32,027 --> 00:38:34,172
I'll get a beating today. Darn it.

387
00:38:34,947 --> 00:38:36,615
All of them are gone.

388
00:38:39,507 --> 00:38:40,510
Darn it.

389
00:38:56,159 --> 00:38:58,048
Hurry up, Munni.

390
00:38:58,128 --> 00:39:00,373
I have heard that a ghost has come into our village.

391
00:39:00,452 --> 00:39:04,842
Yes. All kinds of strange noises could be heard last night.

392
00:39:06,246 --> 00:39:08,522
Did you read today's newspaper? - Why?

393
00:39:09,096 --> 00:39:11,565
I heard it has news that a ghost has come into our village.

394
00:39:11,646 --> 00:39:12,943
Really? - Yes.

395
00:39:13,023 --> 00:39:14,340
Have you read it? - Everyone has.

396
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:18,230
Get out of here. If the ghost sees my wife he'll flee.

397
00:39:19,606 --> 00:39:21,018
Hit the marble in the middle.

398
00:39:21,099 --> 00:39:23,807
See. You hit my marble. - Your aim is not right.

399
00:39:23,887 --> 00:39:24,566
Let me play.

400
00:39:24,646 --> 00:39:27,306
No. Give me yours. - See. What you've done.

401
00:39:27,791 --> 00:39:29,423
Catch. Catch.

402
00:39:29,503 --> 00:39:31,202
You dropped it.

403
00:39:31,282 --> 00:39:32,543
What you've done.

404
00:39:32,623 --> 00:39:35,164
As if you saw a ghost? - Don't mention the ghost.

405
00:39:35,244 --> 00:39:38,333
Come on. Hit it. - Catch it.

406
00:39:38,733 --> 00:39:40,068
Hit it.

407
00:39:54,030 --> 00:39:57,268
Don't be naughty. Or I'll call the ghost.

408
00:39:57,454 --> 00:40:00,664
Bathe it properly. - I'm bathing it properly.

409
00:40:03,929 --> 00:40:07,319
Oh my God. Looks like I'll have to be on the tree all night.

410
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:10,206
The villagers have got me scared by talking about the ghost.

411
00:40:14,184 --> 00:40:16,771
What are you doing? Careful. Careful.

412
00:40:16,851 --> 00:40:19,628
Are you also possessed? Where are you running off to?

413
00:40:43,637 --> 00:40:44,666
Come.

414
00:40:49,362 --> 00:40:52,363
Wow. Come.

415
00:41:05,813 --> 00:41:08,320
There is no difference between your head and tail.

416
00:41:17,237 --> 00:41:19,278
Get under the ground quickly.

417
00:41:19,358 --> 00:41:22,867
You'll be in big trouble if our mongoose sees you.

418
00:41:23,974 --> 00:41:28,195
Come on. Go. Go.

419
00:41:47,836 --> 00:41:49,860
Mr. Mongoose. Come out.

420
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:53,649
Come out now. Come out.

421
00:41:56,918 --> 00:41:58,829
Come. Come on.

422
00:42:00,663 --> 00:42:04,217
Come. Come out. Come on.

423
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:06,646
This way.

424
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,585
Come on.

425
00:42:13,235 --> 00:42:16,193
You run before me. I run after you.

426
00:42:16,273 --> 00:42:19,125
You run before me. I run after you.

427
00:42:19,206 --> 00:42:22,048
My dear. My dear. My dear.

428
00:42:22,128 --> 00:42:25,049
My dear. My dear. My dear.

429
00:42:28,527 --> 00:42:29,918
Where did it go?

430
00:42:30,429 --> 00:42:32,757
You've only faced snakes till now.

431
00:42:32,836 --> 00:42:34,659
Try catching a scorpion.

432
00:42:35,972 --> 00:42:38,351
Scared? Get it. Come on.

433
00:42:42,036 --> 00:42:43,887
Why are you circling?

434
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:54,403
Now you guys fight. And I'll watch the fight.

435
00:42:55,311 --> 00:42:56,738
Come on start.

436
00:42:59,878 --> 00:43:01,356
Coward.

437
00:43:06,485 --> 00:43:08,682
Come out. Come on.

438
00:43:09,710 --> 00:43:11,033
Are you deaf?

439
00:43:11,114 --> 00:43:15,322
I'm telling you. Are you going to eat fish in the water only?

440
00:43:19,077 --> 00:43:21,498
Look. I'll keep this fish here.

441
00:43:21,775 --> 00:43:23,530
I dare you to come eat it.

442
00:43:25,650 --> 00:43:30,735
So you won't come? Alright. It's lying here. I'll come again.

443
00:43:59,311 --> 00:44:02,996
Uncle Bhiku. Uncle Bhiku - What is it?

444
00:44:03,333 --> 00:44:04,509
What do you want?

445
00:44:04,588 --> 00:44:07,277
Need a couple of fishes. - Yes. Come here.

446
00:44:07,449 --> 00:44:09,273
Be careful. Come slowly.

447
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:21,320
You catch fish at the lake every day.

448
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:23,326
I need extra fish today.

449
00:44:23,407 --> 00:44:25,541
Why? Do you have guests?

450
00:44:25,621 --> 00:44:26,994
You may think so.

451
00:44:27,074 --> 00:44:29,769
Has the ghost come to your house as guest?

452
00:44:29,849 --> 00:44:31,905
Do wish to invite it to have fish?

453
00:44:32,554 --> 00:44:36,160
Am I also invited? - No. Not at all.

454
00:44:37,257 --> 00:44:39,160
Okay. So you ate the fish.

455
00:44:43,173 --> 00:44:47,134
Come. Come. Come.

456
00:44:51,744 --> 00:44:54,519
I dare you to have it before me.

457
00:45:29,398 --> 00:45:33,358
I see. So it's you who eats my fish.

458
00:45:34,536 --> 00:45:37,485
Hey crocodile, why didn't you tell me earlier?

459
00:45:52,958 --> 00:45:54,748
Hello my friend chameleon.

460
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:57,057
Where is it?

461
00:46:01,501 --> 00:46:05,099
My friend. Where are you running off to?

462
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:09,052
Please listen to me. Don't be afraid of me.

463
00:46:10,202 --> 00:46:13,835
I've caught you to see how you change colours.

464
00:46:29,726 --> 00:46:32,079
Come. Come. Come.

465
00:46:33,692 --> 00:46:36,114
Come. Come. Come.

466
00:46:41,731 --> 00:46:43,045
Where must have he gone?

467
00:46:48,193 --> 00:46:52,248
Come. Come. Come. Come.

468
00:46:56,724 --> 00:46:59,360
Come. Come. Come. Come.

469
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:01,726
Come. Come. Come. Come.

470
00:47:05,657 --> 00:47:06,854
Come. Come. Come.

471
00:47:07,726 --> 00:47:10,736
Where has he gone? Why hasn't he still not come?

472
00:47:12,077 --> 00:47:14,208
Come. Come. Come.

473
00:47:15,911 --> 00:47:17,489
Come. Come. Come.

474
00:47:18,007 --> 00:47:21,196
Hey...Hey...The fish is right here.

475
00:47:21,465 --> 00:47:22,766
Don't throw tantrums.

476
00:47:22,847 --> 00:47:26,551
Here. Here. I've got it for you. Come on. Take it.

477
00:47:48,161 --> 00:47:50,299
Mr. crocodile, all is well with you?

478
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:54,106
Here. I've got fish for you.

479
00:47:54,327 --> 00:47:59,282
Come. Here. Up. Up. Open your mouth.

480
00:47:59,447 --> 00:48:04,144
Open your mouth. Come up.

481
00:48:04,346 --> 00:48:10,980
Here. Here. Here. Here. Take it.

482
00:48:11,242 --> 00:48:12,509
Now eat it.

483
00:48:20,762 --> 00:48:21,793
Yummy, isn't it?

484
00:48:28,775 --> 00:48:30,442
Don't you want more fish?

485
00:48:30,521 --> 00:48:36,875
Here. Take it. Come up. Take it. Here.

486
00:48:36,954 --> 00:48:40,036
Take it. Come up. Jump. Jump.

487
00:48:40,313 --> 00:48:42,859
Come on. Jump. Here.

488
00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:44,590
If you learn to jump properly..

489
00:48:44,670 --> 00:48:47,918
..I'll start a circus wherein crocodiles work.

490
00:48:47,998 --> 00:48:50,610
I'll do what no one in the world has done.

491
00:48:50,690 --> 00:48:54,044
Here. Here. Jump. Come up.

492
00:48:54,125 --> 00:48:58,873
Here. Here. Take it.

493
00:48:59,115 --> 00:49:00,652
I'm the king here.

494
00:49:00,731 --> 00:49:04,000
While I'm here no one can do you any harm.

495
00:49:04,081 --> 00:49:07,294
Here. Here. Here. Take it.

496
00:49:07,621 --> 00:49:12,914
Come up. Here. Take it. Jump. Here. Here.

497
00:49:13,335 --> 00:49:16,318
Here. Take it. Jump.

498
00:49:18,152 --> 00:49:20,608
You like fish a lot, don't you?

499
00:49:24,891 --> 00:49:27,492
Here. Here. Take it.

500
00:49:27,686 --> 00:49:29,983
Open your mouth. Don't you want more?

501
00:49:30,219 --> 00:49:32,307
Here. Here. Come on.

502
00:49:32,717 --> 00:49:34,460
Your mouth is so big.

503
00:49:35,545 --> 00:49:38,631
Here. Here. Take it.

504
00:49:38,963 --> 00:49:43,274
Don't you want more? Here. Here. Come on. Take it.

505
00:49:44,407 --> 00:49:45,798
Now chew on it.

506
00:49:46,668 --> 00:49:48,786
I'll get fish for you every day.

507
00:49:53,380 --> 00:49:55,608
Come. Let's find snakes.

508
00:49:55,688 --> 00:49:58,237
Go that way. - I'll go this way only.

509
00:49:58,317 --> 00:50:00,215
Search. He can't get away.

510
00:50:00,295 --> 00:50:03,194
He told me they're right here. - It is. Under this.

511
00:50:03,275 --> 00:50:04,989
We might find eggs. - Under the rock.

512
00:50:05,068 --> 00:50:07,757
Check down there. I'll check here.

513
00:50:07,836 --> 00:50:10,675
They must be here. - Hold on they're here.

514
00:50:10,755 --> 00:50:13,103
Let me look here. They must be here.

515
00:50:13,184 --> 00:50:14,730
They must be here for sure. - They aren't.

516
00:50:14,809 --> 00:50:16,777
They're not here. - You talk rubbish.

517
00:50:16,858 --> 00:50:19,440
Do you see them? - Let's search on the other end.

518
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:22,090
Basanta. What are you guys doing?

519
00:50:22,768 --> 00:50:25,951
Saima, come here. I feel the eggs must be behind this.

520
00:50:26,032 --> 00:50:28,207
Where? - You guys come here.

521
00:50:28,286 --> 00:50:29,949
Come here. Come fast. - Let's go. He's calling us.

522
00:50:30,030 --> 00:50:31,680
The eggs must be behind this. - Where is it?

523
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:34,323
Where is it? - You guys be alert.

524
00:50:34,557 --> 00:50:37,284
I'll remove this. - Okay. Okay. Careful. Careful.

525
00:50:37,364 --> 00:50:39,518
Do you see them? Slowly.

526
00:50:40,153 --> 00:50:41,364
Snake.

527
00:50:42,188 --> 00:50:45,675
It's a snake. - Help. Help.

528
00:50:50,684 --> 00:50:53,472
Stop staring at my face. Save me from this snake.

529
00:50:53,552 --> 00:50:56,669
Help. Someone. Help.

530
00:51:01,898 --> 00:51:03,157
Help.

531
00:51:03,572 --> 00:51:04,790
You come.

532
00:51:04,871 --> 00:51:06,990
You help me. - I'm afraid.

533
00:51:07,070 --> 00:51:10,942
You help me. - No. No.

534
00:51:11,461 --> 00:51:13,509
You guys are such cowards.

535
00:51:14,989 --> 00:51:18,836
Ramu. Ramu, help. See. A snake. - Don't be afraid. Trust me.

536
00:51:18,916 --> 00:51:21,335
Careful, Ramu. Careful.

537
00:51:22,393 --> 00:51:23,542
Careful.

538
00:51:24,775 --> 00:51:27,910
You see how brave Ramu is. You guys are cowards.

539
00:51:28,394 --> 00:51:31,231
Careful, Ramu. Careful.

540
00:51:31,992 --> 00:51:33,126
Careful, Ramu.

541
00:51:34,344 --> 00:51:36,011
Pick me up at least now.

542
00:51:38,474 --> 00:51:39,809
I'm badly hurt.

543
00:51:44,965 --> 00:51:47,925
The snake didn't bite you. Why are you screaming and shouting?

544
00:51:49,130 --> 00:51:51,967
Won't it hurt if a boulder falls on my leg?

545
00:52:54,942 --> 00:52:56,451
Here. Here. Come.

546
00:52:57,666 --> 00:52:58,552
Come.

547
00:53:03,155 --> 00:53:04,255
Here.

548
00:53:05,728 --> 00:53:06,994
Come. Here.

549
00:53:07,811 --> 00:53:08,972
Here.

550
00:53:14,695 --> 00:53:17,836
Here. Give me 50 paisa. And Here's a sweet song for you.

551
00:53:18,244 --> 00:53:21,710
Here. Give it. Give. Give it to me.

552
00:53:21,789 --> 00:53:23,612
Give it to me.

553
00:53:24,021 --> 00:53:28,296
Give me 50 paisa. Here's a sweet song.

554
00:53:28,768 --> 00:53:33,438
Truth is dead. Lie has triumphed.

555
00:53:33,518 --> 00:53:35,659
Chandrapal. Chandrapal.

556
00:53:37,451 --> 00:53:41,146
Come, my king. I'll drink.

557
00:53:41,226 --> 00:53:45,539
And I'll sing a sweet song for you.

558
00:53:45,956 --> 00:53:50,072
Moron. You claim others poetries to be yours and throw your weight around.

559
00:53:50,494 --> 00:53:52,847
So what? The voice is mine.

560
00:53:53,039 --> 00:53:54,632
Have you come to listen to my song?

561
00:53:54,711 --> 00:53:57,621
You're ridiculous. I had been to the sea the other day.

562
00:53:57,701 --> 00:53:59,288
Never mind it.

563
00:53:59,367 --> 00:54:02,732
Let's have a drink. - You always cut me off.

564
00:54:02,913 --> 00:54:04,248
Hear me out.

565
00:54:04,586 --> 00:54:08,530
I ventured into the sea the other day when the storm was its peak.

566
00:54:08,610 --> 00:54:12,702
But why? But why did you go there in the storm?

567
00:54:12,782 --> 00:54:15,643
Just generally. - I ask why.

568
00:54:15,722 --> 00:54:18,826
I swear. I saw a really terrifying creature there.

569
00:54:18,905 --> 00:54:20,617
Why did you see it if it was terrifying?

570
00:54:20,769 --> 00:54:22,222
Why didn't you close your eyes?

571
00:54:22,302 --> 00:54:27,038
Don't cry, my dear. Go to sleep. Otherwise the ghost will be here.

572
00:54:27,117 --> 00:54:32,018
My mother would put me to bed every day singing this.

573
00:54:32,461 --> 00:54:36,467
So you mean to say the terrifying creature you saw the other day..

574
00:54:36,547 --> 00:54:37,913
..was indeed very large?

575
00:54:37,994 --> 00:54:39,942
I swear. It was 40 feet long.

576
00:54:40,246 --> 00:54:43,713
Did you measure it? - What nonsense. How could I measure it?

577
00:54:44,385 --> 00:54:46,606
So why do you say it was 40 feet long? Deduct a few feet.

578
00:54:46,686 --> 00:54:48,958
It must be 25 feet for sure.

579
00:54:49,387 --> 00:54:51,733
Deduct some more feet. - Okay. 15 feet.

580
00:54:51,813 --> 00:54:53,579
What's the final measurement?

581
00:54:53,659 --> 00:54:56,838
Come on. You're bargaining like a merchant.

582
00:54:57,103 --> 00:55:01,731
Of course. You're exaggerating its length. Do you think I'm a fool?

583
00:55:02,255 --> 00:55:06,656
Don't waste time in chit chatting? Sing songs of love..

584
00:55:06,737 --> 00:55:08,856
..and unite people.

585
00:55:09,222 --> 00:55:13,769
Hear me out. - What hear me out?

586
00:55:13,849 --> 00:55:17,481
All I want is for people to listen to my song.

587
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:19,981
Are you going to hear me out?

588
00:55:20,061 --> 00:55:21,890
Do you have time to listen to my song?

589
00:55:21,969 --> 00:55:24,241
Okay, you sing. I'll listen.

590
00:55:25,371 --> 00:55:27,418
Movie song or a song from a play? - Movie song.

591
00:55:27,619 --> 00:55:29,854
Of unison or separation? - Unison.

592
00:55:30,226 --> 00:55:32,454

593
00:55:32,753 --> 00:55:34,981
Love song or sad song? - Sad song.

00:55:35,061 --> 00:55:38,329
Mohammad Rafi's or Kishore Kumar's? - Mohammad Rafi's.

595
00:55:38,409 --> 00:55:41,775
Lyrics by Shailendra or by Majrooh. - Lyrics by your daddy.

596
00:55:41,856 --> 00:55:43,624
I shouldn't have said I will listen.

597
00:55:43,704 --> 00:55:45,685
I deserve a beating with a sandal.

598
00:55:45,858 --> 00:55:48,653
Your sandal or mine? - To hell with you.

599
00:55:53,052 --> 00:55:58,795
"Give me the strength so that I can quit drinking."

600
00:55:58,876 --> 00:56:04,463
"I teach everyone to live by sharing my experiences."

601
00:57:31,717 --> 00:57:32,730
Are you sleeping?

602
00:57:35,956 --> 00:57:37,821
You're like a statue of stone.

603
00:57:39,088 --> 00:57:40,224
Extremely beautiful.

604
00:57:42,873 --> 00:57:44,180
I like you.

605
00:58:00,490 --> 00:58:02,760
Aren't you sleeping? You are awake.

606
00:58:06,690 --> 00:58:08,821
Your legs do lots of things.

607
00:58:09,112 --> 00:58:12,391
You walk on them. You dig pits with them. You swim with them.

608
00:58:13,351 --> 00:58:16,866
What? Your nails are so big.

609
00:58:19,931 --> 00:58:21,377
Where are your ears?

610
00:58:23,005 --> 00:58:24,914
Oh. So here they are.

611
00:58:25,155 --> 00:58:27,480
I wondering where your ears disappeared.

612
00:58:28,608 --> 00:58:30,102
You're a female.

613
00:58:31,166 --> 00:58:33,512
Still your back is stone like.

614
00:58:46,867 --> 00:58:50,561
You catch fish with these teeth. Eat your babies.

615
00:58:56,684 --> 00:58:58,843
Your teeth are so big.

616
00:59:00,233 --> 00:59:02,211
Okay. Enough of the talking.

617
00:59:02,384 --> 00:59:04,702
I'm feeling sleepy. You also go to sleep.

618
00:59:43,876 --> 00:59:45,100
Sister.

619
00:59:47,715 --> 00:59:49,141
What's the matter? - Where is Ramu?

620
00:59:49,222 --> 00:59:51,868
Why? Ramu must be at school.

621
00:59:52,643 --> 00:59:54,773
All the kids go to school by that route.

622
00:59:54,853 --> 00:59:56,788
Then why does your son go this way?

623
00:59:56,932 --> 01:00:00,420
With a fishing rod. Think. Don't mind what I said.

624
01:00:03,429 --> 01:00:06,626
Ramu's mother. Haven't seen Ramu in school for a while now.

625
01:00:06,706 --> 01:00:08,473
Is he unwell?

626
01:00:08,554 --> 01:00:11,131
He goes to school every day. He is absolutely fine.

627
01:00:11,809 --> 01:00:13,241
I haven't seen him.

628
01:00:13,422 --> 01:00:16,362
He used to come to eat. Now he doesn't.

629
01:00:17,083 --> 01:00:19,635
He must be getting food somewhere else.

630
01:00:27,505 --> 01:00:32,134
If there is not man in the house it's the mother's duty to reform the kids.

631
01:00:33,108 --> 01:00:35,344
Send him to school every day.

632
01:01:00,585 --> 01:01:02,295
Where are you coming from? - From the school.

633
01:01:02,375 --> 01:01:03,829
You lie, you scum.

634
01:01:03,909 --> 01:01:05,960
You roam around under the pretext of school.

635
01:01:06,041 --> 01:01:08,402
I raised you with much difficulty. - Don't beat me.

636
01:01:08,481 --> 01:01:10,724
And you're ruining my efforts.

637
01:01:10,804 --> 01:01:12,590
You roam around in the name of school.

638
01:01:12,670 --> 01:01:14,277
Mother, why are you beating him? - The villagers ask.

639
01:01:14,358 --> 01:01:15,644
Leave him. - Why didn't he go to school?

640
01:01:15,724 --> 01:01:17,809
What has he done? Leave him.

641
01:01:17,889 --> 01:01:20,043
What do I tell the villagers?

642
01:01:20,123 --> 01:01:22,769
Come on. Leave me. - Shameless. Rascal.

643
01:01:22,849 --> 01:01:25,205
He gets fish for us. He gets vegetables for us.

644
01:01:25,284 --> 01:01:27,391
He gathers wood for us. Why are you beating him?

645
01:01:27,471 --> 01:01:30,567
Stop crying. Stop crying. Stop crying?

646
01:01:31,478 --> 01:01:35,394
Why would we have to people's taunts had his father been alive?

647
01:01:35,474 --> 01:01:39,096
Right. Are they going to provide for us? How would they know about our pain?

648
01:01:39,422 --> 01:01:42,554
We earn a living by selling the fish Ramu catches.

649
01:01:42,635 --> 01:01:44,908
But honor also matters. - I know.

650
01:01:44,987 --> 01:01:47,245
And I also know the people of this world

651
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,996
If the man is alive they would wish for his death.

652
01:01:51,076 --> 01:01:54,130
And if he is dead they'll worship. - Stop preaching.

653
01:02:00,418 --> 01:02:03,193
Ramu, don't mind mother's beating.

654
01:02:03,273 --> 01:02:06,922
Fed up of people's complaints mother beat you up.

655
01:02:08,048 --> 01:02:11,447
It's okay. A mother beat her son. So what?

656
01:02:14,574 --> 01:02:16,414
I'll never hurt mother.

657
01:02:27,092 --> 01:02:33,388
"The chameleon saves his life by changing colors every second."

658
01:02:33,858 --> 01:02:39,795
"He is a fraud who changes color every second."

659
01:02:45,938 --> 01:02:52,152
"The chameleon saves his life by changing colors every second."

660
01:02:53,840 --> 01:02:59,852
"If you stick to a color your life can be worthwhile."

661
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:18,192
My crocodile came this way.

662
01:03:18,905 --> 01:03:20,373
Why did it come to this spot?

663
01:03:27,367 --> 01:03:31,608
Oh. I understood why he has dug a pit.

664
01:03:32,226 --> 01:03:34,635
Swami had told me the other day..

665
01:03:34,715 --> 01:03:37,898
..that crocodiles dig a pit in the ground for their eggs.

666
01:03:38,632 --> 01:03:41,842
I'll come tonight and see how he lays the eggs.

667
01:04:21,168 --> 01:04:26,470
Come. Come. Take. Here. Here.

668
01:04:26,780 --> 01:04:30,257
Come. Come. Come.

669
01:04:30,338 --> 01:04:33,700
Here. Here.

670
01:04:33,780 --> 01:04:40,066
Come up. Come up. Higher. Higher.

671
01:04:40,146 --> 01:04:44,893
Here. Here. Higher. A little higher.

672
01:04:44,972 --> 01:04:49,847
Higher. Here. Take it. Very good.

673
01:04:56,715 --> 01:04:58,608
Hey...where are you going?

674
01:04:59,083 --> 01:05:01,842
You got what you wanted and off you went.

675
01:05:01,922 --> 01:05:03,608
You had fish and off you went.

676
01:05:03,688 --> 01:05:06,245
Okay. Okay. Go. I'll come in the evening.

677
01:05:26,891 --> 01:05:30,576
Ramu, I beat you badly, isn't it? - No, mother.

678
01:05:30,655 --> 01:05:34,650
I beat you bad. Is it hurting? - Not at all.

679
01:05:34,730 --> 01:05:36,112
You had food?

680
01:05:36,510 --> 01:05:40,825
Ramu, always listen to mother hereafter. Got it?

681
01:05:41,907 --> 01:05:44,405
My son, go to school every day from tomorrow.

682
01:05:44,485 --> 01:05:46,594
Okay. Okay. Won't you guys go to sleep?

683
01:05:46,675 --> 01:05:48,687
It's really late. Let's sleep.

684
01:06:05,527 --> 01:06:08,649
Where are you off to? - I'll go just to the backyard.

685
01:06:09,092 --> 01:06:12,628
Don't go anywhere else. Come back soon. - Alright?

686
01:08:01,646 --> 01:08:03,735
Come. Come. Come.

687
01:08:04,835 --> 01:08:05,859
Come. Come.

688
01:08:07,222 --> 01:08:09,237
Ramu. Ramu.

689
01:08:17,048 --> 01:08:17,893
Me?

690
01:08:20,943 --> 01:08:21,918
Get up.

691
01:08:24,445 --> 01:08:26,617
What? What happened?

692
01:08:28,118 --> 01:08:29,432
Did you see my crocodile?

693
01:08:30,145 --> 01:08:31,632
What did you say? Frog?

694
01:08:33,868 --> 01:08:35,930
How did I come here?

695
01:08:36,845 --> 01:08:40,318
Hey...What did you say? - The old man can't hear.

696
01:08:41,176 --> 01:08:44,753
Get up. Go freshen up quickly.

697
01:08:45,417 --> 01:08:47,078
Come with me. - Where?

698
01:08:48,073 --> 01:08:51,297
Forgot? We have to lay the roof.

699
01:08:52,771 --> 01:08:54,881
I'm not coming to lay the roof. - You're strange.

700
01:08:55,055 --> 01:08:56,902
You said you would come on Wednesday.

701
01:08:57,060 --> 01:08:59,246
Now you're going back on your word.

702
01:08:59,327 --> 01:09:01,680
I won't come today. Go. I'll come next tuesday.

703
01:09:01,760 --> 01:09:02,766
What did you say?

704
01:09:03,430 --> 01:09:05,824
He doesn't hear anything else. He hear only want he wants to hear.

705
01:09:05,904 --> 01:09:08,979
What are you saying? - I'm coming. You go.

706
01:09:09,059 --> 01:09:10,418
Okay. Come soon.

707
01:09:10,662 --> 01:09:12,481
I have wretched luck.

708
01:09:25,234 --> 01:09:27,469
Come on. - Coming.

709
01:09:30,721 --> 01:09:32,423
Give me these leaves.

710
01:09:34,797 --> 01:09:37,005
Hurry up. - Hold on.

711
01:09:38,029 --> 01:09:42,318
Pick up the broom. Here. Hold the ladder. Come on. Properly.

712
01:09:44,645 --> 01:09:46,852
Pick up those leaves. - Hold on.

713
01:09:47,641 --> 01:09:50,734
Hurry up. - Here.

714
01:09:50,814 --> 01:09:53,564
Why are you giving all at once? Pass one at a time.

715
01:09:53,645 --> 01:09:55,565
Alright? - Hurry up.

716
01:09:58,470 --> 01:10:00,975
Come on. Get some more. Stop staring.

717
01:10:01,542 --> 01:10:04,330
You're still here. Go. - Okay.

718
01:10:04,871 --> 01:10:07,189
Get it quickly. - Right away.

719
01:10:09,188 --> 01:10:10,842
Here. Here. - Here.

720
01:10:10,921 --> 01:10:13,103
Raise it higher. - Here.

721
01:10:14,798 --> 01:10:15,782
Here.

722
01:10:24,153 --> 01:10:27,094
Don't just stand there. Go get some more leaves.

723
01:10:27,173 --> 01:10:28,387
Okay.

724
01:10:34,202 --> 01:10:36,257
Got some more? - Yes.

725
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:46,420
Tie it properly. - Okay

726
01:10:46,501 --> 01:10:49,596
You'll get jobs regularly if you work hard.

727
01:10:50,390 --> 01:10:51,442
Come on. Properly.

728
01:11:44,921 --> 01:11:47,889
Carefully. Carefully. Place it.

729
01:12:21,746 --> 01:12:24,458
The job's done. Off I go.

730
01:12:24,537 --> 01:12:27,900
Alright. Go straight home. - Yes.

731
01:12:27,980 --> 01:12:29,639
He is so impatient.

732
01:12:39,875 --> 01:12:41,568
I wonder what would've been of the eggs.

733
01:12:41,648 --> 01:12:43,068
I'll go check.

734
01:12:43,483 --> 01:12:45,137
Where are you running off to?

735
01:12:45,217 --> 01:12:47,639
I'm in great deal of hurry. I'll come back and tell.

736
01:12:54,653 --> 01:12:59,480
'Where is he running off to like that? I smell a rat.'

737
01:12:59,560 --> 01:13:02,047
Radha. - Coming, mother.

738
01:13:31,091 --> 01:13:34,834
Oh no. The crocodile's eggs  are lying broken.

739
01:13:39,988 --> 01:13:42,673
It broke all the eggs so mercilessly.

740
01:13:50,023 --> 01:13:52,194
Killed a mother's children.

741
01:13:52,990 --> 01:13:55,529
What rascal has done this?

742
01:14:04,095 --> 01:14:05,147
Oh no.

743
01:14:13,091 --> 01:14:15,029
Do you know only to lay eggs?

744
01:14:16,945 --> 01:14:19,069
Don't you know to protect them?

745
01:14:46,632 --> 01:14:50,715
Radha, take good care of the house.

746
01:14:51,207 --> 01:14:52,936
I'll come back as soon as the work's done.

747
01:14:53,015 --> 01:14:55,807
But how long do I be here alone? Come soon.

748
01:14:55,887 --> 01:14:58,528
I'm going to the village nearby. I'll be back soon.

749
01:14:58,608 --> 01:15:00,603
Take your time. Leave the house to me and...

750
01:15:00,682 --> 01:15:02,229
No. You come back soon.

751
01:15:02,470 --> 01:15:07,036
Yes. I'll try. And Ramu, don't trouble your sister.

752
01:15:09,099 --> 01:15:10,454
Give this to me.

753
01:15:17,975 --> 01:15:20,141
Here's the glass. - Here's your shirt.

754
01:15:20,220 --> 01:15:22,437
I don't want shirt or anything.

755
01:15:27,475 --> 01:15:32,457
"I want to go to the village where there is no school."

756
01:15:32,677 --> 01:15:37,713
"I want to study at the place where you get education from experience."

757
01:15:37,793 --> 01:15:42,854
"I want to go to the village where there is no school."

758
01:15:42,935 --> 01:15:47,940
"I want to study at the place where you get education from experience."

759
01:15:48,020 --> 01:15:52,970
"I want to go to the village where there is no school."

760
01:15:53,050 --> 01:15:55,833
"I want to study at the place where you get education from experience."

761
01:15:55,913 --> 01:15:58,753
Where are they going? Let me see.

762
01:17:36,345 --> 01:17:38,918
So? Did I make you wait for too long?

763
01:17:38,998 --> 01:17:40,317
Here I am.

764
01:17:44,912 --> 01:17:46,856
Here. Here. Open your mouth.

765
01:17:46,935 --> 01:17:49,569
Here. Here. Here.

766
01:18:00,350 --> 01:18:02,751
Here. Come on. Take it.

767
01:18:06,597 --> 01:18:10,368
Here. Here. Up. Get it. Get it.

768
01:18:10,448 --> 01:18:12,599
Come on. Here. Here. - Oh my God.

769
01:18:12,680 --> 01:18:15,032
Here. Here. Very good.

770
01:18:22,622 --> 01:18:25,404
Here. Here. Up. Get it. Get it.

771
01:18:25,484 --> 01:18:27,182
Here. Come on.

772
01:18:29,560 --> 01:18:32,549
I see. He is raising this terrifying crocodile.

773
01:18:32,630 --> 01:18:36,064
Let me to go inform father right away. This is going to be fun.

774
01:18:44,864 --> 01:18:48,565
Father. Father. Father. - What is it?

775
01:18:48,725 --> 01:18:50,351
Why do you like you've seen a ghost?

776
01:18:50,431 --> 01:18:54,987
Ramu is completely crazy. He went to the lake in the jungle.

777
01:18:55,311 --> 01:18:57,823
Did you also go there? - No. I had to go.

778
01:18:58,295 --> 01:19:02,273
I was on my way back home. Radha was following Ramu.

779
01:19:02,353 --> 01:19:05,435
I also went to the lake to find out the secret.

780
01:19:06,131 --> 01:19:09,306
That day we saw a crocodile at Shankar's house.

781
01:19:09,992 --> 01:19:14,268
I saw one exactly like it. A really big crocodile.

782
01:19:14,606 --> 01:19:16,329
Near the lake? - Really.

783
01:19:16,409 --> 01:19:20,341
Ramu was feeding it fish.

784
01:19:20,792 --> 01:19:24,971
It must be the ghostly creature that came out of the sea.

785
01:19:25,130 --> 01:19:27,773
That day I told everyone they made fun of me.

786
01:19:28,457 --> 01:19:31,224
Okay. Don't go near the lake. - Okay.

787
01:19:31,778 --> 01:19:34,538
I'll tell the villagers and make some arrangements.

788
01:19:34,618 --> 01:19:36,344
Come with me. - Okay.

789
01:19:39,096 --> 01:19:41,725
Well done. You came and told me on time.

790
01:19:42,398 --> 01:19:44,917
It's better if we kill that crocodile.

791
01:19:45,377 --> 01:19:50,629
You saved the village like Lord Krishna. The villagers will praise you.

792
01:19:50,708 --> 01:19:52,344
Well done. See you.

793
01:20:19,922 --> 01:20:22,184
Don't be afraid, Basanta. I'll save you.

794
01:20:28,738 --> 01:20:31,139
'That day Ramu came to my aide as my saviour.'

795
01:20:31,220 --> 01:20:33,167
'Had he not saved me then I would be...'

796
01:20:34,177 --> 01:20:38,618
"No. Today I'll definitely repay this favour of Ramu's.'

797
01:20:46,292 --> 01:20:48,333
Why has Gajanan called us?

798
01:20:49,412 --> 01:20:51,965
He has nothing to do. He calls us unnecessarily.

799
01:20:52,046 --> 01:20:54,414
It's nothing important. - Come.

800
01:20:54,494 --> 01:20:56,677
He has gathered the entire village. - You guys also come.

801
01:20:56,757 --> 01:20:59,105
It must be something urgent. That's why he has called us.

802
01:20:59,185 --> 01:21:02,516
Come on. I'll tell you. - What is it? Where are we going?

803
01:21:02,596 --> 01:21:04,024
Come on, people.

804
01:21:04,163 --> 01:21:05,500
Come on, let's go.

805
01:21:05,845 --> 01:21:06,945
I don't know what happened.

806
01:21:07,506 --> 01:21:08,544
I don't know.

807
01:21:09,243 --> 01:21:12,228
Sit. Sit. - Sit down, everyone.

808
01:21:12,644 --> 01:21:14,208
Sit. Sit. - Tell. What is it?

809
01:21:14,288 --> 01:21:16,527
Come. Tell. - He can talk only  if you keep quiet, right?

810
01:21:16,608 --> 01:21:19,396
Sit. Sit. - Let the ones standing also sit.

811
01:21:19,476 --> 01:21:20,585
Let everyone settle down.

812
01:21:20,664 --> 01:21:23,889
Hurry up. Sit. Come on. - What are they doing?

813
01:21:23,969 --> 01:21:25,731
Listen. Listen. Listen.

814
01:21:25,811 --> 01:21:30,021
Brother, the other day I told that a ghostly creature come out of the sea..

815
01:21:30,101 --> 01:21:33,162
..you guys made fun of me. Do you know what it was?

816
01:21:33,507 --> 01:21:36,188
It was a crocodile. - Crocodile.

817
01:21:37,001 --> 01:21:39,311
Oh my God. - Quiet. Quiet. Listen carefully.

818
01:21:39,590 --> 01:21:41,368
Now do you know where it is?

819
01:21:41,631 --> 01:21:44,128
In the lake in the nearby jungle.

820
01:21:44,208 --> 01:21:47,789
He'll take our kids at the first opportunity. Got it?

821
01:21:48,011 --> 01:21:50,182
Oh God. We can't let that happen.

822
01:21:51,525 --> 01:21:54,548
If we don't act he'll eat us too.

823
01:21:55,123 --> 01:21:58,576
I suggest let's go there tomorrow morning and kill it.

824
01:21:58,655 --> 01:21:59,759
Do you guys say?

825
01:21:59,838 --> 01:22:02,498
Yes. We should kill it. Kill it. Kill it.

826
01:22:02,578 --> 01:22:07,313
He is in that lake far away. Let it be there.

827
01:22:07,626 --> 01:22:09,563
How is he going to harm us?

828
01:22:10,636 --> 01:22:13,660
In the rivers of north India, numerous crocs live.

829
01:22:13,739 --> 01:22:15,375
They don't kill humans.

830
01:22:15,935 --> 01:22:18,875
You keep quiet. Come. I'll throw you into the lake.

831
01:22:19,387 --> 01:22:22,100
Then let's see if it kills you or hugs you.

832
01:22:24,529 --> 01:22:26,502
Kill that croc immediately.

833
01:22:26,582 --> 01:22:28,461
Otherwise the croc will kill all of us.

834
01:22:28,541 --> 01:22:30,108
He is right. - What is he talking about?

835
01:22:30,461 --> 01:22:31,630
Has he gone crazy?

836
01:22:33,158 --> 01:22:36,790
Not just the croc's teeth. Its mouth is also big.

837
01:22:37,006 --> 01:22:39,462
A swing of the tail is enough to kill a man. Got it?

838
01:22:39,890 --> 01:22:42,685
You fool. A crocodile never attacks with its tail.

839
01:22:42,765 --> 01:22:46,989
A foreigner told us about crocs on TV the other day.

840
01:22:47,252 --> 01:22:48,817
It lives in water.

841
01:22:49,086 --> 01:22:52,074
He won't come to our houses to bite us.

842
01:22:52,154 --> 01:22:54,828
How would that foreigner know about our village's croc?

843
01:22:54,908 --> 01:22:56,268
Heard that kid?

844
01:22:56,884 --> 01:22:57,895
To hell with him.

845
01:22:57,975 --> 01:23:01,043
There is a huge difference between reading books and watching TV.

846
01:23:01,340 --> 01:23:03,069
I guess this boy doesn't know that.

847
01:23:03,149 --> 01:23:05,422
It's better if we kill this crocodile.

848
01:23:06,253 --> 01:23:11,747
All I know is that crocs eat frogs, rats, goose etc.

849
01:23:11,828 --> 01:23:15,332
And eats fish. It doesn't harm humans.

850
01:23:15,412 --> 01:23:17,131
What you say is correct.

851
01:23:17,211 --> 01:23:20,701
In Kerela, there is this lake in a temple in my mother's village.

852
01:23:20,780 --> 01:23:22,935
There are numerous crocs in it.

853
01:23:23,015 --> 01:23:26,387
We used to bathe in it every day. They never bit us.

854
01:23:26,713 --> 01:23:30,817
All those crocs are God's crocs.

855
01:23:30,896 --> 01:23:32,172
This is a wild croc.

856
01:23:32,252 --> 01:23:34,614
If you go near it, it will eat you in a flash.

857
01:23:36,807 --> 01:23:40,648
Radha. Radha. I've made a huge mistake.

858
01:23:41,373 --> 01:23:42,363
That's nothing new.

859
01:23:42,444 --> 01:23:46,072
No. What I just did is a really big mistake.

860
01:23:46,875 --> 01:23:50,507
You followed Ramu this morning, isn't it? - Yes.

861
01:23:50,811 --> 01:23:53,489
How do you know? - I followed you.

862
01:23:53,980 --> 01:23:54,914
Is it?

863
01:23:57,648 --> 01:23:58,913
So what did you see? Tell me.

864
01:23:58,993 --> 01:24:03,030
I saw Ramu feeding a croc at the lake in the jungle.

865
01:24:03,110 --> 01:24:05,597
Yes, Basanta. He is really brave.

866
01:24:05,677 --> 01:24:08,095
The croc too plays with him lovingly.

867
01:24:08,176 --> 01:24:09,804
They share strange love.

868
01:24:10,344 --> 01:24:15,496
Whatever I saw, I told the entire thing to my father.

869
01:24:16,672 --> 01:24:21,152
You fool. That's disastrous. Your father won't keep quiet.

870
01:24:21,344 --> 01:24:23,488
That's true. He told everyone.

871
01:24:23,568 --> 01:24:25,144
The villagers have gathered under the banyan tree.

872
01:24:25,408 --> 01:24:29,826
You idiot. The villagers will go and kill that croc. Understand?

873
01:24:30,048 --> 01:24:31,752
Ramu loves that croc a lot.

874
01:24:31,832 --> 01:24:34,161
And this mistake of yours will break his heart.

875
01:24:38,577 --> 01:24:41,244
Indeed. I accept.

876
01:24:43,243 --> 01:24:45,956
We'll have to save that croc anyhow.

877
01:24:46,158 --> 01:24:50,503
Let's do this. If we hide it somewhere it will be safe.

878
01:24:51,628 --> 01:24:53,131
We'll have to do something.

879
01:24:53,386 --> 01:24:55,414
First let's go inform Ramu. Come on.

880
01:24:55,494 --> 01:24:56,487
Yes. Let's go.

881
01:25:10,302 --> 01:25:13,664
Ramu. - Ramu.

882
01:25:25,579 --> 01:25:26,943
Where has he gone?

883
01:25:28,222 --> 01:25:30,340
Sister, let's go that way. - Yes.

884
01:25:45,172 --> 01:25:46,479
Ramu.

885
01:25:47,905 --> 01:25:49,247
Ramu.

886
01:25:51,171 --> 01:25:53,233
Ramu. - Ramu.

887
01:25:53,835 --> 01:25:56,270
What happened? Why are you running towards me like that?

888
01:25:56,350 --> 01:25:57,266
Ramu.

889
01:26:00,248 --> 01:26:03,216
Ramu, all the villagers have set out to kill your friend..

890
01:26:03,296 --> 01:26:05,118
..with sticks, knives and machetes.

891
01:26:05,811 --> 01:26:07,838
Oh no. How did they find out?

892
01:26:07,918 --> 01:26:09,934
Who told them about the croc at the lake?

893
01:26:11,047 --> 01:26:14,659
What happened is Basanta followed you today.

894
01:26:14,739 --> 01:26:17,856
And he got scared when he saw you feeding the croc.

895
01:26:17,994 --> 01:26:23,336
He ran back and told his grumpy father everything.

896
01:26:23,765 --> 01:26:26,865
You sinner. You're worse than your father.

897
01:26:27,399 --> 01:26:29,309
Never mind. Save the taunts.

898
01:26:29,467 --> 01:26:30,886
What do we do now? Say.

899
01:26:33,440 --> 01:26:35,979
I am at my wits end.

900
01:26:38,278 --> 01:26:40,118
Ramu, there is a way.

901
01:26:40,402 --> 01:26:42,630
Why don't we go hide that croc somewhere else?

902
01:26:43,521 --> 01:26:46,905
Great. Is he a tiny rat to hide it?

903
01:26:47,239 --> 01:26:50,967
You went and told your father everything. And now you're advising us.

904
01:26:51,047 --> 01:26:54,045
You fool. Even a monkey would be wiser than you.

905
01:26:54,755 --> 01:26:57,488
We'll have to do something before the villagers get there.

906
01:26:57,568 --> 01:26:58,837
Think fast.

907
01:27:00,515 --> 01:27:04,217
What should I do? Relocate him to the sea.

908
01:27:04,449 --> 01:27:07,737
But we don't have time. The villagers will be here any minute.

909
01:27:12,622 --> 01:27:18,070
You guys don't know. How dare Ramu. He is raising a croc.

910
01:27:18,261 --> 01:27:20,146
He is raising our death.

911
01:27:20,856 --> 01:27:23,252
But a human is more dangerous than a croc.

912
01:27:23,332 --> 01:27:25,570
Don't talk much.

913
01:27:27,238 --> 01:27:30,032
My son followed Ramu to that spot.

914
01:27:30,113 --> 01:27:33,552
If the croc had seen my son, he would've eaten him.

915
01:27:34,037 --> 01:27:35,809
My son almost met with calamity today.

916
01:27:35,889 --> 01:27:38,351
But will your children be that lucky in the future?

917
01:27:38,431 --> 01:27:39,510
Think.

918
01:27:41,380 --> 01:27:43,083
You're right, Gajanan.

919
01:27:43,163 --> 01:27:45,314
Sakubai, take care of your grandson.

920
01:27:45,512 --> 01:27:47,658
You also warn your son.

921
01:27:48,229 --> 01:27:51,498
Why should we let our children die? Why not kill the croc?

922
01:27:51,578 --> 01:27:54,376
Yes. We should kill it. We should kill it.

923
01:27:54,456 --> 01:27:58,904
It is dangerous. We should kill it.  Or it will kill us.

924
01:27:58,984 --> 01:28:01,853
It is dangerous. We should kill it.

925
01:28:03,322 --> 01:28:06,920
We'll kill it after offering prayers to the Goddess.

926
01:28:07,265 --> 01:28:10,465
We'll kill it after offering prayers to the Goddess first thing in the morning.

927
01:28:10,737 --> 01:28:15,231
Listen. Listen. Relax. Calm down. Stop fighting.

928
01:28:15,311 --> 01:28:18,582
Listen. We'll have to kill it.

929
01:28:18,662 --> 01:28:20,717
No. We will not kill it.

930
01:28:20,797 --> 01:28:26,503
Brother, listen. We will have to kill it. Come.

931
01:28:26,583 --> 01:28:28,554
Let's go. Get up.

932
01:28:28,634 --> 01:28:35,369
Come on. We'll kill it. We'll kill it.

933
01:28:35,449 --> 01:28:38,934
We'll kill it. We'll kill it. We'll kill it. We'll kill it.

934
01:28:39,014 --> 01:28:40,604
Come on, let's go.

935
01:28:41,112 --> 01:28:42,470
I have an idea.

936
01:28:42,550 --> 01:28:45,956
Let's take it to the other side of the lake anyhow.

937
01:28:46,371 --> 01:28:47,560
This is child's play?

938
01:28:47,815 --> 01:28:51,060
There is dense jungle in the middle. How are we going to take it?

939
01:28:52,997 --> 01:28:54,132
There is a way.

940
01:28:54,212 --> 01:28:56,823
If we break that bank he'll run away on his own.

941
01:28:57,038 --> 01:28:59,135
But just two people will not be able to break the bank.

942
01:28:59,216 --> 01:29:00,554
But it's the three of us.

943
01:29:00,768 --> 01:29:03,328
Three of us? Are you including yourself too?

944
01:29:03,408 --> 01:29:04,844
Will you be able to do this?

945
01:29:04,923 --> 01:29:08,041
These things are not meant for women. It's such a huge bank.

946
01:29:08,121 --> 01:29:10,525
They'll get here by the time we break it.

947
01:29:10,747 --> 01:29:14,434
Why can't I do it? God has given me two hands and two legs.

948
01:29:14,514 --> 01:29:16,538
Whatever. Don't underestimate women.

949
01:29:17,048 --> 01:29:19,457
Come on. Let's stop talking and get working.

950
01:29:19,663 --> 01:29:23,351
Okay. You two leave. I'll get the spade, axe and rope.

951
01:29:23,587 --> 01:29:24,729
Come on, Basanta.

952
01:29:38,323 --> 01:29:39,797
You know the route, right?

953
01:29:40,164 --> 01:29:42,350
Yes. I took this route the other day.

954
01:29:47,110 --> 01:29:49,802
What the heck. This doesn't seem  to be that route. What's wrong?

955
01:29:54,134 --> 01:29:55,719
What's wrong? Why did you stop?

956
01:29:56,029 --> 01:29:58,652
I don't understand. - Tell me. What's the matter?

957
01:30:00,036 --> 01:30:01,453
What's wrong with me?

958
01:30:01,689 --> 01:30:03,418
You said you know the route.

959
01:30:03,938 --> 01:30:05,819
Yes I did. But I...

960
01:30:07,862 --> 01:30:09,045
What do I do?

961
01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:11,673
You've got me in a fix.

962
01:30:11,753 --> 01:30:14,324
Idiot. Let's sit there till Ramu comes.

963
01:30:14,404 --> 01:30:16,524
Come on. - Okay. Let's go.

964
01:30:20,331 --> 01:30:21,596
Now what do we do?

965
01:30:39,856 --> 01:30:41,350
Why are these guys sitting here?

966
01:30:43,033 --> 01:30:45,131
Basanta, hold this. - Darn it.

967
01:30:45,342 --> 01:30:46,471
You're here.

968
01:30:47,573 --> 01:30:50,954
I have got all the tools. - I'll carry the rope and spade.

969
01:30:51,034 --> 01:30:53,965
Okay. - I'll carry the spade.

970
01:30:54,314 --> 01:30:56,800
Ramu, I can breathe now that you're here. - Hurry up. They must be on the way.

971
01:30:56,880 --> 01:30:57,791
Okay.

972
01:31:00,395 --> 01:31:01,759
Come on. Let's go. - Come on.

973
01:31:27,372 --> 01:31:29,468
You're the root cause of all the problem. Come fast.

974
01:31:29,548 --> 01:31:30,610
Okay.

975
01:31:35,301 --> 01:31:37,695
Ramu, will be able to even see the croc in this darkness?

976
01:31:37,774 --> 01:31:38,898
Leave that to me.

977
01:31:38,979 --> 01:31:40,449
Sister, hold my hand. - Yes.

978
01:31:40,529 --> 01:31:41,763
My God. It's pitch dark.

979
01:31:41,842 --> 01:31:44,786
Be careful. I know the way.

980
01:31:44,865 --> 01:31:46,412
As I come here every day.

981
01:31:46,903 --> 01:31:49,498
Come on. Do your job. Don't brag.

982
01:31:49,997 --> 01:31:51,484
Where is the croc?

983
01:31:51,564 --> 01:31:53,075
Where is it?  - I would find it here every day.

984
01:31:53,154 --> 01:31:54,396
Where has it disappeared?

985
01:31:55,192 --> 01:31:56,734
Look, there it is.

986
01:31:56,935 --> 01:31:59,474
Yes. Let's get to work. Fast. Come on.

987
01:32:00,740 --> 01:32:02,837
Hurry up or those people might show up.

988
01:32:11,916 --> 01:32:15,375
O Mother, save our kids from that croc.

989
01:32:15,454 --> 01:32:18,192
O Goddess, you're our saviour.

990
01:32:18,271 --> 01:32:21,340
O Goddess, please protect us.

991
01:32:40,055 --> 01:32:43,480
'I see. So these people are going to kill Ramu's croc.'

992
01:32:43,697 --> 01:32:45,876
'I'll have to stop them anyhow.'

993
01:33:07,265 --> 01:33:08,804
'This looks like a good idea.'

994
01:33:09,688 --> 01:33:11,582
'They'll pass by this way.'

995
01:33:11,868 --> 01:33:14,091
"Let me lay these thorns here."

996
01:33:30,342 --> 01:33:32,547
'Let me tie a rope securely in their way.'

997
01:33:32,859 --> 01:33:36,068
'They'll trip over the rope in the dark and break their legs.'

998
01:33:36,552 --> 01:33:39,155
'They think they can kill Ramu's croc.'

999
01:33:49,730 --> 01:33:51,643
Push it this way. This way.

1000
01:33:55,474 --> 01:33:57,801
Pick up the pace. - I am.

1001
01:33:59,591 --> 01:34:01,710
Ramu, what must have been here previously?

1002
01:34:01,791 --> 01:34:03,613
The wall of a house.

1003
01:34:08,474 --> 01:34:12,037
You see. I've dug such a deep pit. - I saw. Okay?

1004
01:34:16,197 --> 01:34:19,422
What happened? What happened? - A skull. Ramu, remove it. Remove it.

1005
01:34:19,502 --> 01:34:22,354
Don't be afraid, my warrior. - Don't pick it up.

1006
01:34:22,435 --> 01:34:24,613
Never mind. - Ramu!

1007
01:34:26,021 --> 01:34:29,498
How can the dead harm anyone?  - Throw it away, Ramu.

1008
01:34:49,314 --> 01:34:50,550
Ramu.

1009
01:35:42,532 --> 01:35:45,047
That's enough. Let's get the croc out.

1010
01:35:51,690 --> 01:35:53,135
I'm scared.

1011
01:35:57,953 --> 01:35:59,596
Come. Come. Come.

1012
01:36:00,244 --> 01:36:04,777
Here. Here. Come. Come on.

1013
01:36:05,028 --> 01:36:09,854
Come. Come. Here. Here.

1014
01:36:10,604 --> 01:36:13,043
Come. Come. Come.

1015
01:36:13,423 --> 01:36:17,756
Here. Here. Come. Come on.

1016
01:36:21,673 --> 01:36:23,957
Slide the noose carefully. - Yes.

1017
01:36:25,565 --> 01:36:27,045
Tie it securely.

1018
01:36:30,088 --> 01:36:32,390
Come on. Hurry up. - Hold the rope.

1019
01:36:32,470 --> 01:36:35,079
Pull fast. Pull fast. Careful.

1020
01:36:35,399 --> 01:36:38,046
He is opening his mouth. - Pull fast.

1021
01:36:39,109 --> 01:36:40,121
Pull fast.

1022
01:36:40,201 --> 01:36:41,789
Hold it tightly, Basanta.

1023
01:36:42,490 --> 01:36:44,557
Hold the rope tightly.

1024
01:36:44,886 --> 01:36:46,564
Pull. Harder.

1025
01:36:52,244 --> 01:36:54,631
Pull. Harder. Harder.

1026
01:37:09,039 --> 01:37:11,011
My hands are hurting a lot.

1027
01:37:14,020 --> 01:37:15,153
Pull.

1028
01:37:19,902 --> 01:37:22,635
Make sure it doesn't go onto the other side.

1029
01:37:30,867 --> 01:37:32,069
Pull.

1030
01:37:41,894 --> 01:37:43,520
Pull. - Pull.

1031
01:37:52,472 --> 01:37:53,613
Pull harder.

1032
01:37:57,350 --> 01:37:59,088
Ramu, he's going to the other side.

1033
01:37:59,168 --> 01:38:02,894
No matter what. Keep pulling. This way.

1034
01:38:06,283 --> 01:38:08,489
Come on, people.

1035
01:38:11,931 --> 01:38:13,809
What is this?

1036
01:38:15,893 --> 01:38:19,698
Thorns. Watch out. There are thorns here.

1037
01:38:22,474 --> 01:38:25,224
Remove the thorn. Come on.

1038
01:38:26,140 --> 01:38:28,592
Remove the thorn. Come on. Careful.

1039
01:38:30,115 --> 01:38:32,872
My arms are burning badly.

1040
01:38:38,904 --> 01:38:41,520
Looks like the villagers are coming.

1041
01:38:45,944 --> 01:38:48,992
Ramu. Hurry up. The villagers are here. - Yes, sister.

1042
01:38:51,144 --> 01:38:52,560
Pull fast.

1043
01:39:07,631 --> 01:39:10,463
Oh God. See. He's going on his own.

1044
01:39:10,543 --> 01:39:13,523
That's great. He'll get to the sea quickly.

1045
01:39:14,444 --> 01:39:17,439
Let's do this. Let's kill it.

1046
01:39:18,399 --> 01:39:20,315
Sister, he's going towards the sea.

1047
01:39:20,395 --> 01:39:23,083
Yes. I'm glad we got here on time.

1048
01:39:27,493 --> 01:39:29,828
Let's pull it all the way to the sea quickly.

1049
01:39:31,635 --> 01:39:34,391
Sister, look, the villagers are here.

1050
01:39:34,471 --> 01:39:36,963
Hurry up. Come fast. Very good.

1051
01:39:41,277 --> 01:39:42,563
Hurry up.

1052
01:39:43,407 --> 01:39:47,234
There it is. Get it.

1053
01:39:47,314 --> 01:39:52,693
My croc. Go. Go, my friend. Don't worry. I guess we met only to part.

1054
01:39:52,773 --> 01:39:56,509
Don't worry about me. Go, friend. Go. Go.

1055
01:40:01,698 --> 01:40:04,141
Kill it. Kill it.

1056
01:40:05,859 --> 01:40:08,097
The villagers are here. What's going to happen now?

1057
01:40:08,615 --> 01:40:11,069
Don't worry. I'll take it deep into the sea.

1058
01:40:11,149 --> 01:40:12,972
Ramu. - Where are you going? Ramu.

1059
01:40:14,853 --> 01:40:17,837
Kill it. Kill it.

1060
01:40:18,095 --> 01:40:21,154
Go, my friend. Hurry up. Otherwise the villagers will kill you.

1061
01:40:21,234 --> 01:40:24,225
Go, my friend. Hurry up.

1062
01:40:24,690 --> 01:40:29,046
Ramu. Ramu.  - Go, my friend.

1063
01:40:29,545 --> 01:40:30,778
Ramu.

1064
01:40:30,858 --> 01:40:33,923
Stop. Don't throw. Ramu might get hurt.

1065
01:40:34,184 --> 01:40:36,757
Ramu. - Ramu.

1066
01:40:39,243 --> 01:40:43,643
Go, my friend.  - Hats off to Ramu. Look at Ramu.

1067
01:40:44,043 --> 01:40:47,439
Ramu. - Look at Ramu go.

1068
01:40:48,715 --> 01:40:52,564
Ramu. - He is the bravest.

1069
01:40:54,497 --> 01:40:58,735
Ramu, careful. Ramu, come out.  - Come out.

1070
01:40:58,815 --> 01:41:00,487
This is no mean feat.

1071
01:41:01,341 --> 01:41:05,125
Ramu is alive. Yes. Ramu and his sister both.

1072
01:41:07,136 --> 01:41:08,954
Ramu. Ramu, are you alright?

1073
01:41:09,034 --> 01:41:10,331
Are you alright? - Yes. I'm fine.

1074
01:41:10,411 --> 01:41:13,773
Is he Basanta,  the son of our brave warrior?

1075
01:41:14,716 --> 01:41:17,163
Sister, I feel like seeing the croc one last time.

1076
01:41:17,243 --> 01:41:20,968
No. Now let's go home, Ramu.  - Well done, kid. Well done.

1077
01:41:21,047 --> 01:41:22,135
God bless.

1078
01:41:23,423 --> 01:41:27,350
But how come the croc spared you? He didn't kill him.

1079
01:41:27,430 --> 01:41:29,348
Well done. God bless you.

1080
01:41:29,529 --> 01:41:32,081
He is awesome. - You did an amazing thing, Ramu.

1081
01:41:32,377 --> 01:41:33,795
My brother is so brave.

1082
01:41:33,875 --> 01:41:37,782
He is our son. Brave son.

1083
01:42:11,770 --> 01:42:13,085
Hey..

1084
01:42:15,472 --> 01:42:17,305
My croc's egg.

1085
01:42:47,750 --> 01:42:48,987
Wow.

1086
01:42:52,615 --> 01:42:53,859
Hey!
