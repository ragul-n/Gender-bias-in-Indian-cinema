1
00:01:12,372 --> 00:01:13,532
How much longer. . .?

2
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:20,406
The original Madhuri DiXit takes
at least 2 to 3 hours to get ready

3
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:23,272
So what, if our Madhuri takes. . .

4
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:32,451
That's because lying next to his wife,
he dreams of Madhuri, every night. . .

5
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:44,430
Madhuri ! Madhuri ! Madhuri. . .

6
00:02:03,256 --> 00:02:04,280
''Hello! ''

7
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:05,424
''Hello! ''

8
00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:08,386
''So. . . what would you
like to listen to?''

9
00:02:08,528 --> 00:02:11,520
''First tell us
where you have been''

10
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:16,435
''I. . .? I've been
waiting for someone''

11
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:18,327
''Who's he?''

12
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:21,469
''He's the one I love''

13
00:02:22,342 --> 00:02:23,331
''God ! ''

14
00:02:24,244 --> 00:02:27,236
''He's the one I keep
pleading with''

15
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,447
''How. . .?''

16
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:30,238
''This is how''

17
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:54,439
''One, two, three, four, five,
siX, seven, eight, nine. . .''

18
00:02:55,241 --> 00:02:58,369
''ten, eleven,
twelve, thirteen. . .''

19
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:03,414
''for you, I wait,
counting every moment I spend''

20
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,343
''Come to me, my love.
Spring has arrived''

21
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:24,231
''On the fourteenth,
I received word from you. . .''

22
00:03:24,404 --> 00:03:27,430
''on the fifteenth,
you had promised to return''

23
00:03:28,274 --> 00:03:31,266
''You came neither on the fourteenth
nor on the fifteenth. . .''

24
00:03:31,444 --> 00:03:34,413
''what did you get out of
tormenting my poor heart?''

25
00:03:35,248 --> 00:03:36,272
''On the sixteenth. . .''

26
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:39,485
''I dressed up only for you''

27
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,447
''Come to me, my love.
Spring has arrived''

28
00:03:43,523 --> 00:03:46,424
''For you, I wait,
counting every moment I spend''

29
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:49,524
''Come to me, my love.
Spring has arrived''

30
00:04:23,496 --> 00:04:26,363
''What trap are you
caught up in. . .?''

31
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:29,460
''what state have you been in
of late. . .?''

32
00:04:31,237 --> 00:04:32,499
''I. . .''

33
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,504
''nowadays. . .''

34
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:40,241
''wait. . .''

35
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:44,416
''for the one. . .''

36
00:04:45,251 --> 00:04:47,515
''who shall come to me
with all his love''

37
00:04:49,355 --> 00:04:52,381
''Why's your skin glowing. . .?
Why're you blossoming. . .?''

38
00:04:52,525 --> 00:04:55,392
''what gives your breath
its fragrance?''

39
00:04:56,462 --> 00:05:00,262
''What mischief is this. . .?''
Why has your veil slipped. . .''

40
00:05:00,366 --> 00:05:02,493
''why do you walk
so provocatively?''

41
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:05,397
''I. . .''

42
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,502
''nowadays. . .''

43
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,307
''wait. . .''

44
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:17,443
''for the one. . .''

45
00:05:18,284 --> 00:05:20,514
''who shall come to me
with all his love''

46
00:05:33,466 --> 00:05:34,330
Khilona. . .
- What?

47
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:37,459
This what I call sheer lightning
- Oh yes! She's a killer

48
00:05:38,304 --> 00:05:40,295
Shut up!
Treat her like your sister

49
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:44,341
Why? I already have three sisters.
You don't have any!

50
00:05:44,477 --> 00:05:46,377
So aren't your sisters
like my sisters?

51
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:47,376
Raja. . .

52
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,414
Chutki wants to see you.
- Really. . .?

53
00:05:56,322 --> 00:05:58,449
Chutki. . . you performed
so well today. . .

54
00:05:59,258 --> 00:06:02,318
that even the original Madhuri DiXit
would get stunned. . .

55
00:06:02,428 --> 00:06:04,453
Listen, Raja. . .
- Ya?

56
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:08,433
Raja, you know me
since childhood, right?

57
00:06:09,235 --> 00:06:10,361
Yes. . . I haven't lost my memory yet.

58
00:06:10,503 --> 00:06:14,337
Haven't I helped you out,
whenever you've been in trouble?

59
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:16,442
Whenever you've had a problem,
I've helped you out. . .

60
00:06:17,243 --> 00:06:18,437
not the other way around
- Your problem or mine. . .

61
00:06:19,245 --> 00:06:20,507
Isn't it one and the same thing?
- That's true

62
00:06:21,347 --> 00:06:23,406
Would you bear to
see me in trouble?

63
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,410
No way!

64
00:06:26,252 --> 00:06:28,413
When Madhuri DiXit dances in a film,
doesn't she have at least. . .

65
00:06:29,255 --> 00:06:32,224
20-30 dancers along with her?
- Yes

66
00:06:32,358 --> 00:06:35,350
Won't it be unfair, if I don't
even have 3 dancers with me?

67
00:06:35,495 --> 00:06:38,396
Oh yes, very unfair.
Even you should have many dancers

68
00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:41,467
But you know what?
Meena hasn't come. . .

69
00:06:42,502 --> 00:06:44,367
And only Tanni and Bali are with me

70
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:47,329
I need one more girl. . .
- So what do we do?

71
00:06:47,473 --> 00:06:49,270
Why don't you become the girl. . .
- What. . .?

72
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,434
You have to wear the clothes. . .
- What. . .? Me?

73
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:54,338
and just stand there.
- No, No, No. . .

74
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:56,340
What do you mean by No. . .?
- What will the villagers say. . .?

75
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:59,384
I'll feel shy!
- So now. . .

76
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:01,510
where'll I bring one more girl from?
- My father will thrash me!

77
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:04,255
I'll thrash you before that!

78
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:28,379
''What's beneath the blouse. . .?''

79
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:33,409
''What's under the veil. . .?''

80
00:07:34,487 --> 00:07:36,421
''In the blouse,
beats my heart. . .''

81
00:07:37,323 --> 00:07:39,291
''behind my veil,
beats my heart. . .''

82
00:07:45,498 --> 00:07:47,363
Hey! That's Raja !

83
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:51,260
The tomatoes! Let 'em go!

84
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:01,337
Sometimes, I just can't tell the
difference between you and this monkey

85
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:06,241
Now tell me! Why did you
go to the show? Speak up!

86
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:09,278
Now he won't say anything !
Just stand there like an idiot!

87
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:11,490
And yesterday you enjoyed
shaking your ass?

88
00:08:12,358 --> 00:08:14,519
I feel like just beating
the hell out of you. . .

89
00:08:16,462 --> 00:08:19,295
What are you doing? How can you
raise your hand on your grown up son. . .?

90
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:22,333
Your grown up son is getting
a little extra eX cited these days

91
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:26,296
This is the limit. The son of the
village chief, dressed up as a girl !

92
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:28,407
Ruined my reputation
in the whole village!

93
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:30,504
So what did you do?
- I uncovered his face

94
00:08:31,477 --> 00:08:33,445
EXposed him to
the entire village. . .

95
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:35,509
then the crowd
threw tomatoes at us

96
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,214
Tomatoes were thrown?

97
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:43,517
Just sit there and laugh !

98
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:47,516
What about your own daughter?

99
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:50,524
Wasn't she dancing. . .

100
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:54,424
in front of the whole village?
And you're just not concerned?

101
00:08:55,234 --> 00:08:58,499
You are getting irritated
as if it was a shameful act

102
00:08:59,438 --> 00:09:02,339
Dance is an art form. . . It's been
around since the times of the kings. . .

103
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:06,309
Not an art!
It's a disgrace!

104
00:09:06,512 --> 00:09:08,446
You have spoilt this girl

105
00:09:09,248 --> 00:09:11,443
Just me? She's your pet too. . .

106
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:15,283
My pet. . .?
Back off!

107
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:17,414
You don't understand anything. . .

108
00:09:18,257 --> 00:09:20,452
The whole village treats Chutki
with the same affection as we do

109
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:24,457
Know what? The entire village
is talking about you

110
00:09:25,431 --> 00:09:28,525
How do you dance so well?
I have tried so many times but. . .

111
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:33,370
It's not your cup of tea. . .
You ordinary girl from Gajrolla !

112
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:37,465
You mean Chutki is not ordinary?
- She was born here by mistake.

113
00:09:38,277 --> 00:09:40,268
She is actually made for Bombay

114
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:43,408
Bombay. . .?
- What if you could go to Bombay. . .?

115
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,377
She'll create a sensation there!

116
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:49,249
What are you doing here?
- Your place is in the world of movies

117
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,356
''Oh ! Our beloved. . .''

118
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:53,452
''You don't know yourself. . .''

119
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,420
''What you are,
what you ARE''

120
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:04,326
''You'll become Madhuri. . .''

121
00:10:04,503 --> 00:10:06,437
''you've only got to get to Bombay''

122
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:09,400
''All your dreams will come true. . .''

123
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:12,238
''one, two, three four. . .
- Five, siX, seven, eight! ''

124
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:14,313
''You'll become Madhuri. . .''

125
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,505
''you've only got to get to Bombay''

126
00:10:22,254 --> 00:10:23,380
Go away! You talk any rubbish !

127
00:10:23,522 --> 00:10:27,322
Hey bangle-seller. . .
doesn't our Chutki look like Madhuri?

128
00:10:27,493 --> 00:10:30,326
''I sell bangles,
I swear it on them. . .''

129
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:32,397
''you are no less than Madhuri''

130
00:10:33,265 --> 00:10:35,256
''With your finger
pressed between your teeth. . .''

131
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:37,399
''you remind me of Madhuri''

132
00:10:38,237 --> 00:10:39,499
''When you wave your wrist. . .''

133
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:42,407
''you remind me of Madhuri''

134
00:10:42,508 --> 00:10:44,271
''Honestly''

135
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:47,479
''You'll become Madhuri. . .''

136
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:50,441
''I have only got to get to Bombay''

137
00:10:55,454 --> 00:10:57,422
''All your dreams will come true. . .''

138
00:10:58,257 --> 00:11:00,316
''one, two, three four. . .
- Five, siX, seven, eight! ''

139
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:03,257
''You'll become Madhuri. . .''

140
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:08,332
Even the way you cough is attractive.
- It has ruined the sleep of bachelors

141
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:12,462
''Even when you're angry,
you look like Madhuri. . .''

142
00:11:13,305 --> 00:11:15,330
''oh your plait,
you're so mischievous. . .''

143
00:11:15,474 --> 00:11:17,442
''when you roll those eyes. . .''

144
00:11:18,244 --> 00:11:20,474
''you do remind me of Madhuri''

145
00:11:21,313 --> 00:11:24,407
''Every time you smile. . .
- you remind us of Madhuri''

146
00:11:25,317 --> 00:11:27,512
''So how can we not say. . .''

147
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:30,379
''I'll become Madhuri''

148
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,491
''You've only got to get to Bombay''

149
00:11:38,297 --> 00:11:40,356
''All your dreams will come true. . .''

150
00:11:40,499 --> 00:11:42,524
''one, two, three four,
five, siX, seven, eight! ''

151
00:11:43,335 --> 00:11:45,303
''You'll become Madhuri''

152
00:11:45,504 --> 00:11:47,472
Hey soothsayer. . .
I ook at her palm, will you?

153
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:50,242
Sure, why not

154
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:52,443
''It's a unique palm ! ''

155
00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:55,313
''You'll surely make it big
in the film industry''

156
00:11:56,248 --> 00:11:57,510
''May my parrot fly away
if I'm lying ! ''

157
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:02,453
''Now, very soon. . .
your time is about to arrive''

158
00:12:06,258 --> 00:12:07,384
''My fee! ''

159
00:12:07,493 --> 00:12:09,324
''Sit on your thumb! ''

160
00:12:15,367 --> 00:12:17,358
Hey Chutki. . .
- What. . .?

161
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:19,471
''You're an amazing dancer,
you're an amazing singer. . .''

162
00:12:20,272 --> 00:12:21,330
''Me. . .?
- Oh yes, you''

163
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:23,408
''To sullen faces, you bring
a smile in a moment''

164
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:24,504
''Me. . .?
- Yes, you''

165
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:27,335
''Samosa, kachori, pedas,
bundi. . .''

166
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,278
''chham-chham, rossogollas,
burfis and malai. . .''

167
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,509
''would you like some
piping hot jalebis. . .?''

168
00:12:33,352 --> 00:12:35,320
''Or should I send
for a cup of hot tea?''

169
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:38,416
A lot of honey-laced talk!

170
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:40,418
He must surely have a reason !

171
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,421
''My daughter's getting married.
This Sunday evening''

172
00:12:44,363 --> 00:12:46,456
''You will have to dance,
you'll also have to sing. . .''

173
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:49,358
''like Madhuri, you must
entertain everyone! ''

174
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:53,438
My Madhuri sings and dances
only in the movies! Not at weddings!

175
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:56,298
If we offered her money,
even she would agree!

176
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:58,376
So why are you putting on
all those airs?

177
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:00,479
He's right.
- You too, Raja?

178
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,475
You make us dance at will,
and you have so much of attitude?

179
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:07,252
Why not?
She's the Madhuri of Gajrolla

180
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:09,284
And who the hell are you?

181
00:13:23,536 --> 00:13:25,470
''You'll become Madhuri. . .''

182
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:28,273
''you've only got to get to Bombay''

183
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:37,442
Attention ! Attention !
Ladies and gentlemen ! From today. . .

184
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:41,344
The 20th century version,
of the classic, ''Devdas''. . .

185
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:43,421
will be shown in the village theater

186
00:13:45,257 --> 00:13:47,350
Along with superstar
Shah Rukh Khan. . .

187
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:49,450
and the sensational Aishwarya Rai. . .

188
00:13:50,296 --> 00:13:53,288
the film also stars the bewitching,
and ravishing, Madhuri DiXit

189
00:14:06,545 --> 00:14:08,376
How are you, Paro?

190
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:16,415
We meet after so many days. . .
Won't you even look at me?

191
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:19,315
For you they may be days, Dev. . .

192
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:24,286
For me it's been. . . 10 years, 6 months,
4 days and 6 hours

193
00:14:27,499 --> 00:14:30,263
Aishwarya Rai looks so beautiful

194
00:14:31,303 --> 00:14:33,533
''My cruel lover is so heartless. . .''

195
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:37,433
''he doesn't even know how I pine,
he's just a ruthless slaver. . .''

196
00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:50,322
More than half the film is over.
When will Madhuri come?

197
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:04,497
Here comes your Madhuri.
Are you happy now?

198
00:15:31,497 --> 00:15:32,521
Chandramukhi

199
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:42,536
Desist from such ardour Kali Babu.
Get too close and you will burn. . .

200
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:56,515
''Who paints me this emerald?''

201
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:01,516
''My joy. . .''

202
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:05,388
''is killing me''

203
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:17,203
Start the show!

204
00:16:17,242 --> 00:16:18,334
Where's the bloody manager. . .?

205
00:16:26,251 --> 00:16:29,311
Silence! Silence!
Please calm down. . .

206
00:16:31,256 --> 00:16:33,417
Please don't go berserk
and tear the screen !

207
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:35,419
Please don't create problems

208
00:16:37,262 --> 00:16:39,423
Hear me out, please. . .
- What is there to listen?

209
00:16:40,232 --> 00:16:43,292
The rest of the reels have already
left from the neighboring village

210
00:16:43,435 --> 00:16:47,337
He says that every time!
- They'll be here any minute

211
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:51,375
He's lying ! Even last time,
the damn reels arrived two hours late!

212
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:55,344
Yes, and what about the time,
when your bicycle got punctured?

213
00:16:58,484 --> 00:17:02,352
Not to worry. This time
I've sent a scooter! My own !

214
00:17:02,488 --> 00:17:05,355
So! ? your scooter doesn't
get punctured?? Is it?

215
00:17:05,491 --> 00:17:07,356
But it also has the third tyre!

216
00:17:13,332 --> 00:17:15,527
This is the limit!
Now I will have my money back!

217
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:19,327
I'm sure, he's going to be beaten up

218
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:23,475
Here you are

219
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:25,333
Tea for you, Chutki

220
00:17:25,511 --> 00:17:27,411
I think people will have
their money back

221
00:17:27,513 --> 00:17:29,481
Yes, even we should get our refund

222
00:17:30,315 --> 00:17:31,475
I'm not leaving.
I want to see the whole film.

223
00:17:32,284 --> 00:17:36,311
Everyone is leaving Chutki, they
won't play the film for you alone?

224
00:17:36,488 --> 00:17:39,355
So what are you doing here?
Go and stop them !

225
00:17:39,491 --> 00:17:40,458
Do something !

226
00:17:41,493 --> 00:17:43,427
These guys are absolutely useless!
- If you girls are very useful. . .

227
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:47,357
why don't you go and stop them?
- Do not underestimate women

228
00:17:47,499 --> 00:17:49,524
If Chutki wants, she can
stop this ruckus in a minute

229
00:17:50,469 --> 00:17:53,529
Both have gone mad
- You call us mad? You're a loony!

230
00:18:03,348 --> 00:18:05,373
''Whose footfall. . .?

231
00:18:07,486 --> 00:18:09,454
''Whose shadow?''

232
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:16,518
''Who knocks at my heart?''

233
00:18:19,331 --> 00:18:21,356
''Who is come?''

234
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:53,253
''Who paints me this emerald?''

235
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:57,530
''My joy. . .''

236
00:18:59,505 --> 00:19:01,370
''is killing me''

237
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:07,479
''It's killing me''

238
00:19:49,488 --> 00:19:52,355
''Krishna stops me,
and kisses me. . .''

239
00:19:53,258 --> 00:19:55,351
''he kisses me. . .''

240
00:19:55,494 --> 00:19:58,292
''my veil slips off my head. . .''

241
00:20:06,505 --> 00:20:08,336
''I'm slain''

242
00:20:37,502 --> 00:20:39,470
Are you there?
Where are you?

243
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:44,470
Haven't you heard?

244
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:47,278
The entire village is going crazy

245
00:20:47,379 --> 00:20:49,347
What are you talking about?

246
00:20:49,481 --> 00:20:51,346
She has insulted us in front
of the entire community

247
00:20:51,483 --> 00:20:55,442
What's so insulting, Mom?
Everyone was enjoying and clapping

248
00:20:56,321 --> 00:20:57,379
Manju, say something. . .

249
00:20:57,522 --> 00:20:59,285
Yes, Mom. It's true

250
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:00,358
Shut up!
- But mom. . .

251
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:01,323
Shut up!

252
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:02,427
Didn't I say shut up!

253
00:21:03,495 --> 00:21:05,429
You're not a kid anymore!

254
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:07,391
Even I see that. . .
in the mirror

255
00:21:07,466 --> 00:21:10,401
So why don't you stop prancing around?
- I can't, Mom.

256
00:21:11,236 --> 00:21:13,363
Whenever I listen to Madhuri's songs,
I don't know what happens to me. . .

257
00:21:13,505 --> 00:21:15,473
a sort of a current runs
through my body

258
00:21:16,241 --> 00:21:18,334
Wretch ! We're the ones who suffer
the shocks of your current

259
00:21:18,477 --> 00:21:20,445
You know what nasty things people
say behind our backs?

260
00:21:21,313 --> 00:21:24,373
The people can go to hell ! Why are you
making a mountain out of a mole hill?

261
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:27,343
How much time does the poor girl
have to enjoy herself anyway?

262
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:30,444
Once she's married, she'll
go away to her husband's house. . .

263
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:34,357
I don't want to marry.
- That's eXactly what I said. . .

264
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:35,426
before marriage.

265
00:21:36,261 --> 00:21:38,525
But you didn't say that you wanted
to go to Bombay and become a heroine!

266
00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:56,279
It's not a joke?
I really mean it!

267
00:21:56,381 --> 00:21:59,350
I want to go to Bombay and become
a heroine, just like Madhuri. . .

268
00:22:02,287 --> 00:22:05,518
I want to become like Madhuri

269
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:11,286
I told you, her brains
have shifted to her ankles!

270
00:22:12,264 --> 00:22:14,425
Papa, I am very serious.
I want to go Bombay. . .

271
00:22:15,233 --> 00:22:17,258
I'll work very hard. . .
I will make a name for myself

272
00:22:17,402 --> 00:22:20,428
Just once, come and see me perform
on stage. Everyone says that I'm. . .

273
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:22,473
That's enough, Chutki.
- Papa. . . just hear me out. . .

274
00:22:23,308 --> 00:22:26,334
See what your indulgence has done?

275
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:31,346
This is getting to be dangerous.
But no one listens to me!

276
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:34,411
You have to marry her off
at the earliest!

277
00:22:36,488 --> 00:22:39,389
But we have to find
a suitable boy first

278
00:22:40,492 --> 00:22:43,427
Don't you know the teacher's son?

279
00:22:44,262 --> 00:22:46,457
I've seen the way he looks at her

280
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:50,268
His mother even brought it up

281
00:22:50,502 --> 00:22:54,438
They are a very decent family.
- No doubt about that

282
00:22:55,240 --> 00:23:01,406
So let's get them married quickly. . .
it's too good an opportunity to let go

283
00:23:02,481 --> 00:23:05,416
I think you're right.

284
00:23:08,253 --> 00:23:10,380
I must go and meet them
at the earliest

285
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:24,325
You have to make the sequence
without any jokers, ok?

286
00:23:26,505 --> 00:23:30,373
Chutki, I was just talking
to Khilona about you. . .

287
00:23:30,475 --> 00:23:32,500
I've asked him to get the audio
cassette of ''Devdas'' for you

288
00:23:33,345 --> 00:23:35,313
It's of no use now. . . Forget it!

289
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,345
Why? What's the matter?

290
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:41,342
Khilona, why don't you guys step out
for some tea or something?

291
00:23:41,486 --> 00:23:44,216
Sure, let's go. . .
Come Shakeel, let's go

292
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,352
What's the matter?

293
00:23:50,362 --> 00:23:54,230
Everyone pokes fun at me
No one takes me seriously.

294
00:23:54,366 --> 00:23:56,527
Who pokes fun at you?
That's not true.

295
00:23:57,335 --> 00:23:59,235
What happened? Won't you tell me?

296
00:23:59,404 --> 00:24:03,431
Raja, I want to go Bombay. . .
and become a star like Madhuri

297
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:07,335
What? What are you. . .?
- Even you're like the rest of them !

298
00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:11,472
No way, I'm not like them, but. . .
- But what, Raja?

299
00:24:12,317 --> 00:24:15,445
Haven't you seen. . . The way
people praise me, my dance

300
00:24:16,254 --> 00:24:19,348
Everyone loves to join in with me. . .

301
00:24:19,491 --> 00:24:22,460
everybody says ''Chutki, you
are eXactly like Madhuri DiXit. . .''

302
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:25,354
''you dance like her too''
Don't they say it? Don't they?

303
00:24:25,497 --> 00:24:28,295
Do I lack something then?
Can't I become a heroine like her?

304
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:30,367
I can, can't I. . .?
- Of course you can !

305
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:35,433
But Mother keeps nagging dad to get me
married, so she can get rid of me

306
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:39,402
Today even dad agreed. . . he has gone
to the boy's house to finalise matters

307
00:24:40,245 --> 00:24:42,509
What? Which boy?
- The teacher's son. . .

308
00:24:43,515 --> 00:24:46,541
No! He can't do that!
It'll spoil everything

309
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:49,511
I just don't know what to do

310
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:56,454
I should just run away to Bombay.
- No, don't ever say such a thing

311
00:24:57,329 --> 00:25:00,355
So what should I do then?
I'm so confused

312
00:25:12,477 --> 00:25:14,502
You won't hit me. . .
if I suggest something, will you?

313
00:25:16,248 --> 00:25:17,510
Why don't you and me. . .
Get married?

314
00:25:18,416 --> 00:25:21,442
What. . .?
- Don't get me wrong. I got an idea

315
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,379
See. . . your parents want
you married off, right?

316
00:25:24,489 --> 00:25:26,457
And you want to go to Bombay, right?
So, if we get married

317
00:25:27,292 --> 00:25:30,261
Have you lost it? What are you saying?
- Just hear me out once. . .

318
00:25:30,428 --> 00:25:32,419
But what are you saying?
- You can turn it down. . .

319
00:25:33,265 --> 00:25:34,459
if you don't like the idea, okay?

320
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:39,236
It's the duty of parents to marry their
daughters off into decent families

321
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:41,305
Nothing wrong in it

322
00:25:41,506 --> 00:25:47,342
If you and I get married, for the
villagers, we'd be husband and wife

323
00:25:47,479 --> 00:25:52,246
After that, whether we go to Bombay
or anywhere in the world. . .

324
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:55,217
no one can have any problem.
You know what I'm saying?

325
00:25:55,353 --> 00:25:59,346
Once we are able to get out of the
village, with our parents' consent. . .

326
00:25:59,491 --> 00:26:03,257
you can do anything you want!
You can fulfill all your dreams

327
00:26:03,495 --> 00:26:06,293
I want your dreams
to be fulfilled too

328
00:26:07,499 --> 00:26:09,399
But will your father agree?

329
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:12,396
I'll ask my mother
to convince my father

330
00:26:13,338 --> 00:26:14,498
So what do you think of my idea?

331
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:17,440
I must go to Bombay,
at any cost!

332
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:23,413
Wow! This is nice.
Very nice

333
00:26:25,517 --> 00:26:27,382
Look at him.
he's blushing. . .

334
00:26:30,522 --> 00:26:32,513
You don't have to be embarrassed

335
00:26:36,494 --> 00:26:40,362
You worthless chap! Moron !
How could you even think of marriage?

336
00:26:40,498 --> 00:26:43,365
And that too, with a girl who dances
around in the whole village?

337
00:26:43,501 --> 00:26:46,368
Listen. . . even I like Chutki a lot.
- You don't interfere!

338
00:26:46,504 --> 00:26:48,472
I know, the two of you
have planned this together

339
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:51,333
Don't you dare say another word !

340
00:26:51,476 --> 00:26:54,411
No! I'm not going to keep quiet today.
I will have my say

341
00:26:55,246 --> 00:26:58,477
A man becomes responsible once married.
Even the worst, turn a new leaf

342
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:02,344
Only the ones with
some hope improve. . .

343
00:27:02,487 --> 00:27:05,513
But this chap is hopeless. . .
Not even fit for marriage!

344
00:27:06,491 --> 00:27:09,517
And he has the cheek to bring
his own marriage proposal !

345
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:13,226
Listen carefully!
This wedding is not happening

346
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:17,393
Mother, if I can't marry her,
I'll never get married

347
00:27:18,236 --> 00:27:20,431
I'll quit home and become an ascetic.
- Quiet! Am I not talking to him?

348
00:27:21,272 --> 00:27:22,466
You people are cooking
something again?

349
00:27:23,241 --> 00:27:28,406
Look. . . sooner or later, we have
to get our son married, isn't it?

350
00:27:29,247 --> 00:27:31,442
And what's wrong with Chutki?
She's just a little childish

351
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:35,514
Just as he'll become
responsible, so will she

352
00:27:36,388 --> 00:27:39,448
I'm really fond of Chutki.
And he's our only son

353
00:27:40,258 --> 00:27:44,319
If he get's married on time,
he'll soon have children

354
00:27:44,462 --> 00:27:46,453
It will bring so much joy.
They'll jump around the house. . .

355
00:27:47,298 --> 00:27:48,424
shouting ''Grandpa, grandpa''

356
00:27:49,234 --> 00:27:51,429
You will really love it.
Just think about it

357
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:56,502
All that is ok!
But marriage is no joke!

358
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:59,534
I'm not joking either.

359
00:28:00,478 --> 00:28:07,350
I have never interfered in any of
the decisions you have taken, so far

360
00:28:08,253 --> 00:28:11,450
This time you have to consider
my point of view as well.

361
00:28:12,323 --> 00:28:14,416
Our son's entire life depends on it

362
00:28:22,233 --> 00:28:23,495
Now that you have said so much. . .

363
00:28:27,238 --> 00:28:30,332
maybe you are right, maybe
it turns out good for him

364
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:36,246
All right. . . Ask Mr Radheshyam
to come and see me

365
00:28:39,517 --> 00:28:41,382
Chutki, my angel !

366
00:28:42,253 --> 00:28:43,515
You've almost killed me
with joy today!

367
00:28:44,322 --> 00:28:47,519
Didn't I tell you?
Chutki's such a sensible girl

368
00:28:49,494 --> 00:28:51,257
Our Chutki. . .

369
00:28:52,497 --> 00:28:55,398
I can't believe it, she
will leave us and go to her in-laws'?

370
00:28:56,501 --> 00:29:02,269
I'm so happy today!
May you have the longest life

371
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:21,248
Hey. . . not that way.
Over here

372
00:29:39,244 --> 00:29:40,438
So easily we fooled every one!

373
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,338
I'm so thrilled today!
I have never been so happy!

374
00:29:43,515 --> 00:29:46,313
Watching you so thrilled gives me. . .
- Nothing can stop me now. . .

375
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:49,352
from going to Bombay! So many dreams!
All of them will be fulfilled !

376
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:52,218
Oh certainly. We're already married

377
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:55,391
Not that, Raja ! This is only
the beginning ! There's so much to do

378
00:29:55,493 --> 00:29:57,324
When are you going to talk
to your father?

379
00:29:57,428 --> 00:30:00,522
I can't wait anymore. I've got
to go to Bombay! Raja. . . I must!

380
00:30:15,246 --> 00:30:18,238
I'll be having lunch outside, okay?

381
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:21,411
Obviously Mr Raja
is still fast asleep. . .

382
00:30:22,253 --> 00:30:23,413
My respects, father

383
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:26,382
Bless you

384
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:30,325
Father, I've been thinking, maybe
I should start some sort of business. . .

385
00:30:35,266 --> 00:30:36,358
Business?

386
00:30:37,435 --> 00:30:40,404
You can't even handle simple farming,
and want to get into business?

387
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:44,441
It will all happen, father.
Now that I'm married. . .

388
00:30:45,243 --> 00:30:47,404
I have the responsibility of you
and mother. . . I'll learn things now

389
00:30:48,246 --> 00:30:49,508
And obviously,
Bombay will teach me so much

390
00:30:52,483 --> 00:30:54,348
What is this thing about Bombay?

391
00:30:54,485 --> 00:30:57,318
What am I going to do here? I'm not
interested in counting buffaloes. . .

392
00:30:57,422 --> 00:31:00,323
and ploughing the fields. So I
thought I should go to Bombay. . .

393
00:31:00,458 --> 00:31:02,358
and do you proud.

394
00:31:02,493 --> 00:31:06,395
Fantastic! Haven't you done me
enough proud here, already?

395
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:09,500
That now you want to spread
the word in Bombay too?

396
00:31:11,302 --> 00:31:13,361
Get those silly ideas of business
out of your head

397
00:31:13,504 --> 00:31:16,302
And don't even dare talk
about going to Bombay!

398
00:31:17,475 --> 00:31:19,238
I'm leaving now

399
00:31:20,245 --> 00:31:21,507
Father, I could run away, you know?

400
00:31:29,254 --> 00:31:31,484
What did you say?
You could run away?!

401
00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:35,453
Leave right now then !

402
00:31:37,262 --> 00:31:38,422
What are you saying?

403
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:40,424
And what's gotten into you?

404
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:43,462
Mother, I just want to prove myself.
If I'm able make it, on my own. . .

405
00:31:44,302 --> 00:31:46,395
just think of the respect
father will command in the village

406
00:31:46,504 --> 00:31:48,404
Not again !
- What are you doing. . .?

407
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,299
Your son is married now. You can't
treat him like this before his wife!

408
00:31:53,311 --> 00:31:56,474
Why don't you just hear him out
with an open mind?

409
00:31:57,282 --> 00:31:58,442
Give me just once chance, father.

410
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:02,344
Khilona's, aunt's son's brother-in-law
moved to Bombay just four years ago. . .

411
00:32:02,453 --> 00:32:04,318
And he has everything today.

412
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:05,517
Moron !

413
00:32:06,524 --> 00:32:10,392
Tell me something. . .
What are you deprived of?

414
00:32:11,296 --> 00:32:14,288
All this belongs to you. Why don't you
take care of all this first?

415
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:18,528
I know this is mine. Why do you feel
that I want to leave for good?

416
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:21,429
If I leave Gajrolla and go out,
I will understand life. . .

417
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,434
see the world, see how fast
it is pacing ahead. . .

418
00:32:24,242 --> 00:32:27,302
maybe learn new things, about
the latest farming technology. . .

419
00:32:27,478 --> 00:32:31,346
new pesticides, better seeds,
to get a better yield. . .

420
00:32:31,482 --> 00:32:34,451
I'll be the first one in Gajrolla
to use these techniques

421
00:32:35,253 --> 00:32:37,346
Just imagine, you and our family
will be respected so much more

422
00:32:41,259 --> 00:32:43,454
Our son is becoming
quite sensible

423
00:32:46,264 --> 00:32:47,526
I think you must agree with him

424
00:32:54,505 --> 00:32:56,336
Well, all right

425
00:32:58,309 --> 00:32:59,503
I'm not your enemy, you know

426
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:04,244
I'm only worried about you.
May God give you all the success

427
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:09,515
And now we even have our
daughter-in-law for company

428
00:33:11,456 --> 00:33:14,448
I'll be very happy to
spend time chatting with her

429
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:19,361
Mother, behind every successful man,
there has to be a woman

430
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:24,331
Therefore, I may need her in Bombay.
- And, he'll be working so hard there

431
00:33:24,469 --> 00:33:27,233
And me here, living in luXury. . .
Just thinking about it, kills me

432
00:33:27,472 --> 00:33:32,307
And Father, it will mean so much to me
if I could be of any help to him

433
00:33:33,244 --> 00:33:35,405
After all, as a wife,
isn't it my duty?

434
00:33:37,482 --> 00:33:40,542
Wow! That's very well said !

435
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:46,414
Didn't I tell you?
Our Chutki is one in a million

436
00:33:47,291 --> 00:33:51,352
Probably the best thing
Raja has done till now. . .

437
00:33:51,496 --> 00:33:53,464
is that he has brought
such a nice girl to our family

438
00:33:58,236 --> 00:33:59,498
Raja, don't forget to write!

439
00:34:22,493 --> 00:34:25,394
It's all happened so fast.
All of them agreed so easily. . .

440
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:28,431
It's unbelievable. . .
No one got suspicious

441
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:32,498
I think, your mother smelt a rat.
- Mother? No way!

442
00:34:34,472 --> 00:34:37,407
Enough, I'm full. . .
- Ok, we can eat later, if you like

443
00:34:38,509 --> 00:34:40,534
What time will we reach Bombay?
- If the train doesn't run late. . .

444
00:34:41,345 --> 00:34:43,279
we should be there
by 9 or 10

445
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:47,410
Use this bedsheet, ok?

446
00:34:50,488 --> 00:34:52,513
Keep the bridal necklace, Raja.
Must be quite eXpensive

447
00:35:01,499 --> 00:35:03,399
Raja, wake me up before
we reach Bombay.

448
00:35:03,534 --> 00:35:05,525
Sure, don't worry

449
00:35:32,497 --> 00:35:34,465
I don't think the whole of Gajrolla
will have so many people

450
00:35:35,266 --> 00:35:36,324
Crowded, really

451
00:36:04,262 --> 00:36:04,523
Chutki. . .?

452
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:13,259
Raja. . .

453
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:16,433
Where were you? I was. . .

454
00:36:17,308 --> 00:36:19,299
I was so scared.
They kept pushing and jostling

455
00:36:19,477 --> 00:36:21,411
You walk ahead now.
- Come on

456
00:36:31,489 --> 00:36:33,457
Hello, sir. . .
you want a hotel?

457
00:36:34,258 --> 00:36:36,419
Cheap accommodation, sir.
Hotel or lodge?

458
00:36:38,462 --> 00:36:41,454
Out of the way, guys. One look at
new people and all of you pounce

459
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:46,436
Come with me.
Don't trust these guys. . . thugs

460
00:36:47,238 --> 00:36:51,334
I'll find you cheap accommodation
or whatever you need. . .

461
00:36:55,246 --> 00:36:58,238
They take advantage of newcomers.
Where would you like to go, sir?

462
00:36:58,516 --> 00:37:00,507
Actually, even we don't
know where to go. . .

463
00:37:01,452 --> 00:37:03,352
If you don't mind,
may I ask you a question?

464
00:37:03,487 --> 00:37:05,352
Sure sir, go ahead

465
00:37:05,456 --> 00:37:07,424
How does one become a film star?
- What?

466
00:37:08,259 --> 00:37:13,287
Actually, that's why we're here.
She wants to become an actress

467
00:37:15,499 --> 00:37:18,332
Do you people have any clue about
how lucky you are?

468
00:37:20,304 --> 00:37:21,498
For having met me!

469
00:37:23,374 --> 00:37:25,365
I hope you're carrying money on you?
- Yes, of course!

470
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:29,338
Now see, obviously it will take
a while to become an actress. . .

471
00:37:29,513 --> 00:37:32,243
No, why should it take much time?

472
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:35,285
Movies don't get made in a day,
It takes months

473
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:38,352
In my opinion, the two of you
must rent an apartment

474
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:39,518
Rent an apartment. . .?

475
00:37:40,291 --> 00:37:42,384
I could even get you to a hotel,
if you'd like. . .

476
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:44,421
If it's going to take some time. . .

477
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:48,426
I even know of the locality where most
of the people trying in the movies. . .

478
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:51,462
come and stay. If you want,
I could arrange something

479
00:37:52,536 --> 00:37:54,265
That would be nice

480
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:59,505
In the world of films, things totally
change, in just a matter of a second

481
00:38:01,245 --> 00:38:03,406
Would you know where
Madhuri DiXit lives?

482
00:38:04,248 --> 00:38:06,443
Not just Madhuri, Hritik,
Shah Rukh, Amitabh Bachchan. . .

483
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:10,277
Aishwarya Rai, Ajay Devgan. . .
I know all their addresses

484
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:12,354
Ms. Madhuri is my inspiration

485
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:14,458
It's from watching her films
that I've learnt everything

486
00:38:15,259 --> 00:38:17,420
Let's visit her first, Raja.
Let's go to her house. . .

487
00:38:18,262 --> 00:38:21,425
I could take you to her house,
but she's not in town

488
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:25,428
She is married and settled in America.
She has moved there for good

489
00:38:26,237 --> 00:38:27,499
There is no point
in going all the way

490
00:38:28,439 --> 00:38:32,375
If we are not going to see her
at all, then let's not go, Chutki

491
00:38:33,377 --> 00:38:35,436
Please sir, let's go arrange
for our apartment first

492
00:38:46,257 --> 00:38:49,226
Here we are.
This area is called Gokuldham

493
00:38:51,262 --> 00:38:53,287
All those who want to work
in the movies. . .

494
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:55,465
find this locality
to be quite affordable

495
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:59,394
Rents are low, there are
many studios nearby. . .

496
00:39:00,438 --> 00:39:02,429
Filmistan, Kamalistan, Film City

497
00:39:05,242 --> 00:39:07,335
That shop over there.
Prince Diamond

498
00:39:07,478 --> 00:39:10,379
Give Mr Ratanlal my reference. . .
Munnu is my name, got it?

499
00:39:10,481 --> 00:39:12,506
Munnu.
- Right! The job will be done

500
00:39:14,285 --> 00:39:15,513
You're a very good human being

501
00:39:16,487 --> 00:39:19,422
You've been such a great help.
- How much do we owe you?

502
00:39:20,257 --> 00:39:21,281
Just a second

503
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:29,396
997 rupees

504
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:31,467
You mean? 3 less in a thousand?
- Right

505
00:39:32,303 --> 00:39:34,396
For that much, we could hire a jeep
and go all the way. . .

506
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:38,333
to Shahjahanpur from Gajrolla
- Not Shahjahanpur. This is Mumbai !

507
00:39:39,477 --> 00:39:43,413
We didn't even travel nine miles. . .
how much is the fare really?

508
00:39:43,514 --> 00:39:45,414
If you did not trust me, you
should have discussed it before

509
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:47,444
How could we bring it up?
- You could have just asked me!

510
00:39:48,285 --> 00:39:52,415
You should have told us on your own.
- I brought you to the right place

511
00:39:53,257 --> 00:39:55,282
First of all I bring you to the right
place, give you so much information. . .

512
00:39:55,426 --> 00:39:58,418
and you chew my brains!
- We don't intend on chewing anything

513
00:39:59,263 --> 00:40:01,356
We were under the impression
that you are being helpful

514
00:40:01,465 --> 00:40:04,332
Nothing comes for free,
here in Mumbai !

515
00:40:04,468 --> 00:40:06,436
Out with the money now, or you'll
have to pay the waiting-charges

516
00:40:07,304 --> 00:40:10,467
Waiting. . .?
- Yes! To keep me and the taXi waiting

517
00:40:12,276 --> 00:40:14,471
Now just pay him, Raja.
- Such inane charges, Chutki !

518
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,448
You have been unfair.
Very unfair

519
00:40:20,284 --> 00:40:21,251
Here you are

520
00:40:22,486 --> 00:40:25,421
And don't forget me when you make it
as a big heroine. Munnu is the name

521
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:27,417
I don't think we will ever forget you !

522
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:28,520
C'mon

523
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:42,466
What was that he mentioned?
There it is!

524
00:40:43,307 --> 00:40:46,470
Have a seat,
my brother and sister

525
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,339
So, Mr Munnu has sent you here?

526
00:40:51,482 --> 00:40:55,384
In Mumbai. . . houses,
flats, shops, stalls. . .

527
00:40:55,519 --> 00:40:57,419
Everything is available on rent

528
00:40:58,255 --> 00:41:01,418
How much deposit can you pay?
100,000? 200,000?

529
00:41:02,259 --> 00:41:06,218
No. . . we are not looking to buy!
We just want to rent a. . .

530
00:41:06,363 --> 00:41:09,526
Sit down. . . these were
the reasonable ones. . .

531
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:13,528
As you know, real estate
is so eXpensive in Mumbai

532
00:41:15,272 --> 00:41:17,433
We're learning. . .
What now, Raja?

533
00:41:19,243 --> 00:41:21,404
Brother, we don't have so much money

534
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:25,339
See! You just called me brother!

535
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:27,508
This is eXactly how
relationships are built!

536
00:41:28,552 --> 00:41:33,489
See Mr Raja ! There is one good deal !
It's quite affordable

537
00:41:34,358 --> 00:41:37,418
Just that you'll have to pay
the rent for siX months, up front. . .

538
00:41:38,462 --> 00:41:41,363
And the place is just first-class!

539
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:42,523
Mind blowing !

540
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:48,472
Doesn't mind blowing
mean nice, Chutki?

541
00:41:50,241 --> 00:41:51,401
Strange people here

542
00:41:52,309 --> 00:41:55,472
He called this great, first-class,
mind blowing !

543
00:41:56,313 --> 00:42:00,409
Water supply for just 2 hours.
It's more of a factory than a house!

544
00:42:03,454 --> 00:42:07,288
What do we do now, Raja?
- He has already taken the rent

545
00:42:07,424 --> 00:42:11,258
We will have to stay here.
- It's not the place I'm talking about

546
00:42:17,234 --> 00:42:18,496
I'm missing home, Raja

547
00:42:20,271 --> 00:42:24,401
First time, so far away, it's
only natural to miss home, Chutki

548
00:42:26,277 --> 00:42:32,307
I am worried, we are new here,
the city is completely new

549
00:42:33,284 --> 00:42:35,445
How do we start?
Whom should we meet?

550
00:42:37,254 --> 00:42:40,314
We don't know anyone here either.
- Now Chutki !

551
00:42:40,491 --> 00:42:43,255
We've come so far without
anyone's help, haven't we?

552
00:42:43,427 --> 00:42:45,418
It's your belief in yourself
that has brought us this far

553
00:42:46,263 --> 00:42:48,288
Now you don't loose hope!

554
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:51,394
Let's just clean up the mess,
get settled. . .

555
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:54,397
and we will figure something out in
the morning. Everything will be fine

556
00:42:55,272 --> 00:42:57,433
God will set everything right.
Get up now

557
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:04,407
Here we are. . . at the studio

558
00:43:05,482 --> 00:43:08,451
Not just Madhuri,
the Meena Kumaris to the Bipashas. . .

559
00:43:09,286 --> 00:43:10,514
all the actresses have
acted in this studio

560
00:43:14,291 --> 00:43:16,350
Where are you going?
- I want to go inside!

561
00:43:16,493 --> 00:43:19,394
You can't enter!
- But everyone else is going in

562
00:43:19,530 --> 00:43:23,227
They are regulars
- Now, even I'll be regular

563
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:26,469
Really? You come here regularly and
I'll drive you out, regularly!

564
00:43:27,304 --> 00:43:28,464
No, no, sir, eX cuse me. . .

565
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:33,538
I'm Rajaram Singh, son of Jwala Singh,
the village chief of Gajrolla

566
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:36,504
She has come all the way
from Gajrolla, to become an actress

567
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:41,418
She's from Gajrolla or Gangotri,
what do I care?

568
00:43:42,252 --> 00:43:44,413
Do you have a cine artist ID?
Do you. . .?

569
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:47,447
No entry without ID, that's it!

570
00:43:49,526 --> 00:43:52,324
How can we get the ID?
- After you've worked in three films

571
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:57,400
But films are made in there!
- Yes! And unless you let us in. . .

572
00:43:57,534 --> 00:44:00,435
We can't work in the movies!
How do we get the ID then?

573
00:44:01,238 --> 00:44:02,364
I don't know about that!

574
00:44:03,507 --> 00:44:05,441
Okay, where can we meet
the producers and directors?

575
00:44:06,243 --> 00:44:08,404
I don't know about that!
- Please tell us something, brother.

576
00:44:08,512 --> 00:44:12,243
Where should we begin?
- I don't know about that!

577
00:44:12,383 --> 00:44:14,374
How do all the newcomers
go about things?

578
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:17,420
Go and ask them !
- But the problem is, where do we go?

579
00:44:18,255 --> 00:44:20,314
I don't know about that!
- No, please. . .

580
00:44:20,457 --> 00:44:22,425
don't fold your hands.
- What do you want me to do?

581
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:26,525
I don't know!
- But I know something you don't!

582
00:44:28,298 --> 00:44:32,428
She is known as the Madhuri DiXit
of our village, Gajrolla !

583
00:44:34,238 --> 00:44:38,334
Is that so? Not very long ago,
I gave Amitabh Bachchan a compleX!

584
00:44:39,243 --> 00:44:40,505
Is all this one big joke for you?

585
00:44:41,311 --> 00:44:43,279
Should just show you
what I'm capable of?

586
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:47,450
He thinks I'm a joke!
- I beg you ! Please spare me!

587
00:44:48,385 --> 00:44:52,253
Let me do my job!
Please go away!

588
00:44:54,491 --> 00:44:55,458
One moment. . .

589
00:44:56,493 --> 00:45:00,327
Brother, what time do you get off?
- Why?

590
00:45:01,465 --> 00:45:04,263
You want to thrash me?
- No, just thought we'll come back then

591
00:45:05,502 --> 00:45:06,434
Goodbye!

592
00:45:07,237 --> 00:45:10,400
He wouldn't even let us in !
- Don't worry, there are other studios

593
00:45:11,308 --> 00:45:12,468
Get the hell out of here!
- Is this any way to treat. . .?

594
00:45:13,243 --> 00:45:14,505
in front of the kids, you are. . .?
- There is nothing they don't know!

595
00:45:16,246 --> 00:45:17,508
Get out!
- There's a limit to everything

596
00:45:22,519 --> 00:45:24,350
This happens every day

597
00:45:25,422 --> 00:45:27,322
It'll get sorted in a while. . .

598
00:45:28,492 --> 00:45:30,323
You people just moved in?
- Yes

599
00:45:30,461 --> 00:45:31,519
Good

600
00:45:35,232 --> 00:45:36,426
I'm so glad you're here

601
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:39,494
For years, I was deprived
the joy of having neighbors

602
00:45:41,238 --> 00:45:42,398
Sit down. Please be seated

603
00:45:45,309 --> 00:45:49,268
The name is Rajanlal Soni.
Fondly they call me Soni-saheb. . .

604
00:45:49,513 --> 00:45:51,378
And you. . .?
- Rajaram Singh

605
00:45:51,482 --> 00:45:53,313
And she?
- Chutki

606
00:45:53,484 --> 00:45:55,315
Your sister?
- No, no

607
00:45:55,452 --> 00:45:57,283
Wife?
- No, no, no

608
00:45:57,488 --> 00:46:00,389
What do I care as long as I have
some nice neighbours!

609
00:46:02,259 --> 00:46:03,521
Won't you even offer a cup
of tea to your neighbour?

610
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:06,456
Sure, I'll make some. . .

611
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:09,391
You sit down.
Chutki will make it

612
00:46:12,503 --> 00:46:14,471
This is going to happen
often, you know?

613
00:46:15,472 --> 00:46:18,441
My wife. . . she throws me out
of the house, every alternate day!

614
00:46:19,243 --> 00:46:24,374
But why does she do that! ?
- All because of this film business

615
00:46:25,249 --> 00:46:26,443
Are you in the film business?

616
00:46:27,251 --> 00:46:31,415
In it? I've been in it
for the last 25 years!

617
00:46:32,489 --> 00:46:36,357
But honestly, the films business
has ruined my entire life!

618
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:43,331
You're just joking, right?
- You think I'm joking?

619
00:46:45,235 --> 00:46:47,260
All it does is shows you dreams!

620
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:50,269
I've slept on the pavements,
lived on the streets. . .

621
00:46:50,374 --> 00:46:52,342
stayed without food for days together!

622
00:46:53,243 --> 00:46:55,336
You know?
I've worked in over 50 films!

623
00:46:56,413 --> 00:46:58,438
But you won't really
find me in any!

624
00:47:00,284 --> 00:47:02,445
These days I just put up
with my nagging wife. . .

625
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:05,481
give maths tuitions to
3rd standard students. . .

626
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:10,453
and in the evening, have my nip
of booze and go to sleep

627
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:14,430
If you ever want
to curse an enemy. . .

628
00:47:15,265 --> 00:47:18,257
just wish that he should
join the film business!

629
00:47:19,269 --> 00:47:21,294
We don't have tea leaves.
I'll go and get some

630
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:28,240
See? She got emotional
with my story. They all do

631
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:35,343
''The film world is
going through bad times''

632
00:47:36,486 --> 00:47:37,453
''You know why. . .?''

633
00:47:38,422 --> 00:47:41,255
''Because they yet don't have
Mr Roomi''

634
00:47:47,231 --> 00:47:48,391
''The film world is
going through bad times''

635
00:47:49,233 --> 00:47:51,463
''Because they yet don't have
Mr Roomi''

636
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:54,234
''Our future. . .''

637
00:47:55,239 --> 00:47:57,264
''lies in our hands''

638
00:47:57,541 --> 00:48:00,339
''Our future lies in our hands''

639
00:48:00,477 --> 00:48:03,378
''So why must I work in any silly,
rotten movie that is made?''

640
00:48:04,481 --> 00:48:05,448
''You're right''

641
00:48:06,283 --> 00:48:08,342
''The film world
is going through bad times''

642
00:48:08,452 --> 00:48:11,285
''Because they yet don't have. . .
- Mr Roomi''

643
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:21,296
''They make silly movies these days.
- I feel like laughing at them''

644
00:48:22,266 --> 00:48:24,530
''You had a meeting with Mr J.P.
didn't you? What happened?''

645
00:48:27,237 --> 00:48:29,296
''I met the security and came back.
- Why?''

646
00:48:31,241 --> 00:48:33,300
''He's getting guns fired,
getting them to jump over mountains''

647
00:48:33,477 --> 00:48:36,344
''He's making a war movie,
with 25 heroes''

648
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:39,408
''As for me, I'd like to
do something different''

649
00:48:41,318 --> 00:48:43,411
''In serious films,
the actor is always appreciated''

650
00:48:44,254 --> 00:48:45,414
''But does not work in mainstream films!
What about that?''

651
00:48:47,257 --> 00:48:49,350
''Just get a great body. . .
- Scream your lungs out! ''

652
00:48:49,493 --> 00:48:51,393
''Get into the action scene''

653
00:48:52,396 --> 00:48:54,387
''But it's the romantic heroes,
the girls are crazy about''

654
00:48:54,531 --> 00:48:56,431
''But they can not fill the theaters''

655
00:48:58,235 --> 00:49:00,328
''There's just one formula
to become a star''

656
00:49:00,504 --> 00:49:03,371
''A heroine to my left,
a heroine to my right. . .''

657
00:49:03,473 --> 00:49:04,497
''and me between them''

658
00:49:06,243 --> 00:49:08,268
''With a gun in hand,
confronting the villain. . .''

659
00:49:09,246 --> 00:49:11,237
''It'll stump all the heroes''

660
00:49:11,515 --> 00:49:14,348
''He has the build, he has the height.
- On his face, there is the light''

661
00:49:14,484 --> 00:49:17,317
''He can dance, he can fight. . .
- You have it all, man''

662
00:49:18,488 --> 00:49:21,457
''Get into the movies quickly.
- It'll be great for all of us''

663
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:24,385
''What if the industry gets any worse?
- Where will we guys go?''

664
00:49:31,234 --> 00:49:33,259
''The film world
is going through bad times''

665
00:49:33,403 --> 00:49:36,270
''Because they yet don't have. . .''
- Mr Roomi''

666
00:49:40,243 --> 00:49:40,504
Mr Roomi. . .

667
00:49:43,246 --> 00:49:45,339
I've been watching you,
standing there. . .

668
00:49:45,482 --> 00:49:47,382
you looked very nice

669
00:49:49,519 --> 00:49:52,511
Who are you?
- I'm Chutki. I'm new in Bombay

670
00:49:53,423 --> 00:49:56,324
Just like you. . .
I want to act in the movies

671
00:50:00,464 --> 00:50:02,329
Would you step aside, please. . .?

672
00:50:04,301 --> 00:50:05,529
You want to be an actress?

673
00:50:06,503 --> 00:50:08,471
That's why I've come all the way

674
00:50:11,475 --> 00:50:15,275
Mr Roomi. . .
- Please. . . you can call me Roomi

675
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:21,416
Okay. Since you know
so much about films. . .

676
00:50:21,518 --> 00:50:23,509
I was wondering if you
could help me out a little. . .

677
00:50:25,255 --> 00:50:27,314
I don't know anyone here. . .

678
00:50:27,457 --> 00:50:30,483
No big deal !
What can I do for you?

679
00:50:32,262 --> 00:50:35,390
If you could please introduce me
to some producers and directors. . .?

680
00:50:35,499 --> 00:50:37,433
No problem at all.
Any one you want

681
00:50:38,235 --> 00:50:40,362
Okay then, Sooraj Barjatya. . .

682
00:50:40,504 --> 00:50:43,473
Sanjay Leela Bhansali,
Yash Chopra. . .

683
00:50:44,307 --> 00:50:46,366
Introduce me to all of them
one at a time. Okay?

684
00:50:46,510 --> 00:50:48,478
Sure. . . why not?

685
00:50:49,513 --> 00:50:53,415
But Chutki, it will take some time
to get appointments with such big guys

686
00:50:54,251 --> 00:50:55,513
You'll have to wait for some time

687
00:50:57,320 --> 00:51:00,255
But don't worry!
I have a friend. . .

688
00:51:00,357 --> 00:51:03,451
He is shooting tomorrow. I can
introduce you to him if you'd like

689
00:51:04,394 --> 00:51:06,362
Tomorrow? When?
- At about eleven

690
00:51:06,496 --> 00:51:09,363
That's great! I live right here.
On the fourth floor

691
00:51:09,499 --> 00:51:11,296
Right next to the staircase

692
00:51:11,401 --> 00:51:13,392
Please come home first,
then we'll go. . . Ok?

693
00:51:14,237 --> 00:51:16,398
Oh yes, why not? See you at
your place at eleven tomorrow

694
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:19,373
All right. Please do come.
I'll be waiting

695
00:51:19,476 --> 00:51:20,500
Yes, of course!

696
00:51:30,454 --> 00:51:34,322
That was so smooth, Roomi. . .
It didn't take you long

697
00:51:34,491 --> 00:51:37,426
You know me. . . she has invited
me home tomorrow morning

698
00:51:37,527 --> 00:51:40,394
Don't tell me!
You are too much !

699
00:51:41,231 --> 00:51:42,493
I've just have to take her
to some studio tomorrow

700
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:46,292
I'll show her any of
the shoots happening there

701
00:51:47,237 --> 00:51:49,398
She gets what she wants,
I get what I want!

702
00:51:59,316 --> 00:52:00,374
Roomi-ji. . .

703
00:52:02,452 --> 00:52:04,283
You look pretty

704
00:52:05,255 --> 00:52:06,279
Please come in

705
00:52:10,494 --> 00:52:13,361
Nice place.
You've found yourself a nice house

706
00:52:13,497 --> 00:52:16,330
Actually I'm really fortunate
to have run into you

707
00:52:16,466 --> 00:52:18,400
Don't know anyone else in this city

708
00:52:22,239 --> 00:52:24,469
I mean, I'm here.
You needn't worry about anything

709
00:52:25,308 --> 00:52:26,468
Hello.
- Who is he. . .?

710
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:29,403
This is Raja.
We've come together from Gajrolla

711
00:52:29,513 --> 00:52:32,380
Mr Roomi, you're the first person
in this city to help us. . .

712
00:52:32,516 --> 00:52:35,508
without any ulterior motive.
Thanks you so much. I'll be right back

713
00:52:36,353 --> 00:52:38,378
But you can't go with us!
- Why not?

714
00:52:39,289 --> 00:52:41,348
We're going on a motorcycle, you see.
- That's okay. . .

715
00:52:41,491 --> 00:52:43,425
I won't take much space.
I'll get ready in a moment

716
00:52:44,261 --> 00:52:46,320
Three people aren't allowed on a bike.
The police will catch us

717
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:50,365
Let's take an auto-rickshaw. He would
also like to watch a film shoot

718
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:52,434
We've got to go to S.K. Studios
beyond Chembur!

719
00:52:53,236 --> 00:52:55,261
We'll unnecessarily end up
spending 100 - 200 rupees

720
00:52:55,438 --> 00:52:58,407
And we aren't going to watch a shoot.
We have a meeting with the director

721
00:52:58,508 --> 00:53:01,306
No problem, we can meet the director
today and watch a shoot tomorrow. . .

722
00:53:01,444 --> 00:53:05,346
Raja, Roomi-ji's right.
Let me go for the meeting today. . .

723
00:53:05,448 --> 00:53:09,509
next time, we'll all go together
- Yes, c'mon, we'll be late

724
00:53:10,453 --> 00:53:11,420
But. . .

725
00:53:11,521 --> 00:53:12,488
Hurry up

726
00:53:24,234 --> 00:53:24,495
Come

727
00:53:27,237 --> 00:53:29,398
Please go slow. . .
I'm scared

728
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:33,209
Don't be scared.
Just hold on tight. . . that's all

729
00:53:46,423 --> 00:53:49,256
Looks like the beginning
of a whole new plot.

730
00:53:52,262 --> 00:53:53,422
This shoot seems right.
- What?

731
00:53:54,231 --> 00:53:55,289
My friend's shoot

732
00:53:58,501 --> 00:54:02,403
''O beloved, do not
twist my arm. . .''

733
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:06,403
''you might break
my bangles. . .''

734
00:54:07,244 --> 00:54:10,407
''and your butterball
will be angry with you''

735
00:54:11,481 --> 00:54:13,346
Let's go. . .
- One moment!

736
00:54:13,483 --> 00:54:17,317
The director is my friend,
but at shoots he is a little tensed

737
00:54:17,487 --> 00:54:20,354
So he might not behave familiar, okay?
- All right

738
00:54:26,496 --> 00:54:28,464
Good morning, sir.
- Good morning. . . what is it?

739
00:54:29,299 --> 00:54:31,392
She just wants to meet with you.
- Hello, sir

740
00:54:32,235 --> 00:54:34,328
Regarding acting. . .
- Hello

741
00:54:35,238 --> 00:54:37,502
I'm a little busy right now, but
why don't you bring her to the office. . .

742
00:54:38,341 --> 00:54:40,309
We can speak there, at leisure

743
00:54:41,478 --> 00:54:44,311
Roomi-ji, do you know
where the office is?

744
00:54:45,482 --> 00:54:50,317
We can meet again in the office.
If you could please spare a moment. . .

745
00:54:51,454 --> 00:54:54,355
Do you have any photographs?
- I do. . . I'm carrying them. . .

746
00:54:54,491 --> 00:54:56,356
She has them, sir!

747
00:54:58,261 --> 00:54:58,522
Here you are

748
00:55:37,467 --> 00:55:40,493
They are so beautiful. . .
how can anyone laugh at them?

749
00:55:42,238 --> 00:55:43,398
What sort of people
did he take you to?

750
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:47,300
It's not the people, Raja.
It's these pictures

751
00:55:48,244 --> 00:55:51,475
Roomi-ji eXplained everything to me.
To get work in the movies. . .

752
00:55:52,315 --> 00:55:54,476
I need to get a portfolio clicked. . .
- And where can we get that done?

753
00:55:55,452 --> 00:55:58,444
A portfolio costs
a lot of money, Raja

754
00:55:59,255 --> 00:56:01,519
But Roomi-ji has offered
to do it for free!

755
00:56:03,493 --> 00:56:05,461
So Roomi-ji can even
do your portfolio?

756
00:56:06,262 --> 00:56:08,287
Roomi-ji can do everything !

757
00:56:08,465 --> 00:56:10,365
We'll have to leave early tomorrow
morning, find a nice place. . .

758
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:12,468
and click loads of pictures!

759
00:56:13,470 --> 00:56:15,335
What are you doing. . .?
Give that to me

760
00:56:16,473 --> 00:56:18,441
There's something I can't
understand, Chutki

761
00:56:19,242 --> 00:56:23,338
How can all the talent you have
be projected by some pictures?

762
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:26,449
For that, don't you need to
meet a director, face to face?

763
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:29,343
But, Raja. . .
- All right, maybe I'm wrong

764
00:56:30,253 --> 00:56:33,347
It makes sense to ask for pictures
if the person can't present himself

765
00:56:33,490 --> 00:56:36,516
What sort of people would ask for your
pictures when you are right there?

766
00:56:37,494 --> 00:56:39,462
You sound right, But Raja. . .

767
00:56:40,497 --> 00:56:43,364
I visited the studio again,
when you were gone. . .

768
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:46,469
Why? That rude watchman. . .
- He's totally changed now!

769
00:56:47,270 --> 00:56:48,430
How?
- I just gave him some money. . .

770
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:52,367
and he told me everything. A very big
film is being shot there tomorrow

771
00:56:52,509 --> 00:56:55,478
We'll go there early and directly
meet the director himself

772
00:56:56,279 --> 00:56:57,246
All right!

773
00:56:57,480 --> 00:57:00,244
But Raja, we're eXpecting
Roomi-ji tomorrow

774
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:03,310
Why must we take
so many favours from him?

775
00:57:04,287 --> 00:57:07,518
We'll ask Mr Soni to tell Roomi-ji
that we have gone to the studio

776
00:57:08,491 --> 00:57:13,258
All right. But we will
meet the director, won't we?

777
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:15,398
Of course we will.
Just don't worry

778
00:57:16,232 --> 00:57:18,325
I've made all the arrangements

779
00:57:54,237 --> 00:57:57,502
''That my gaze meets yours today,
my heart is devastated. . .''

780
00:58:01,411 --> 00:58:03,504
What sort of heroes
we have these days?

781
00:58:14,524 --> 00:58:16,321
Call Rajiv. Let's take

782
00:58:20,263 --> 00:58:21,525
Your shot is ready, sir

783
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:26,425
That's Rajiv Kumar, isn't it?!
- Yes, it is

784
00:58:28,238 --> 00:58:29,330
And that new girl. . .?

785
00:58:32,342 --> 00:58:33,502
She's the veteran Neelima's daughter.
Isn't she?

786
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:39,414
''I've lost my senses,
I've lost my sleep. . .''

787
00:58:40,250 --> 00:58:41,512
''I wonder what's
happening to me''

788
00:58:44,487 --> 00:58:48,253
The one you thought to be the hero,
is actually the choreographer

789
00:58:55,231 --> 00:58:56,493
But why does he need
to move like that?

790
00:59:06,242 --> 00:59:07,300
Tea, here

791
00:59:10,246 --> 00:59:10,507
Tea

792
00:59:20,256 --> 00:59:21,518
We even get to drink tea, Chutki !

793
00:59:26,496 --> 00:59:28,464
Bablu, is the continuity all right?

794
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:32,468
All right, sir.
- Mr Bhalla, are the dancers in place?

795
00:59:33,269 --> 00:59:35,464
Hurry up, everyone!
Yes, let's take!

796
01:00:02,465 --> 01:00:06,367
''That my gaze meets yours today,
my heart is devastated. . .''

797
01:00:06,536 --> 01:00:08,504
''I've lost my senses,
I've lost my sleep. . .''

798
01:00:09,305 --> 01:00:11,273
''I wonder what's
happening to me''

799
01:00:21,250 --> 01:00:23,241
Okay till here, Bobby.
Let's move to the next shot

800
01:00:28,257 --> 01:00:30,282
She dances pretty well.
Doesn't she, Chutki?

801
01:00:30,493 --> 01:00:34,395
My foot! The choreographer
is far more graceful !

802
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:39,461
All wrong ! She is just
not following him correctly. . .

803
01:00:42,472 --> 01:00:45,373
She is not that bad, Chutki. . .
- No trace of eXpressions on her face

804
01:00:45,508 --> 01:00:47,339
He's dancing so well

805
01:00:49,245 --> 01:00:50,473
She doesn't know anything.
- What do you mean. . .?

806
01:00:54,484 --> 01:00:56,315
Hold this, let me show you. . .

807
01:01:11,501 --> 01:01:13,435
Bablu ! Come here. . .
- Yes sir?

808
01:01:14,303 --> 01:01:16,464
Why is she rehearsing there?
Call her here!

809
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:23,308
What are you doing here?
You ought to be over there

810
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:26,346
Hurry up, the director's
shouting at me! C'mon !

811
01:01:27,250 --> 01:01:29,480
He has asked for me?
- Yes, he's calling you. C'mon

812
01:01:30,486 --> 01:01:32,454
Chutki ! What are you
thinking about? Go on

813
01:01:34,490 --> 01:01:37,425
I told you, I need the location.
The script demands it!

814
01:01:38,261 --> 01:01:40,252
So tell the producer,
the director's asking for it!

815
01:01:41,397 --> 01:01:43,297
What's lying there?
It's getting into the frame

816
01:01:43,499 --> 01:01:45,467
Please stay here, I'll be back

817
01:01:49,338 --> 01:01:52,273
Let him finish,
then we shall meet him

818
01:01:52,475 --> 01:01:54,340
Talk to him and call me. Okay. . .?

819
01:01:55,511 --> 01:01:57,411
Get that crane down.
Let me see the frame

820
01:02:00,483 --> 01:02:03,350
Bhalla, what're they doing in front of
the camera? Give them their positions

821
01:02:03,486 --> 01:02:06,512
You guys. . .
- Bablu-ji has called us

822
01:02:07,323 --> 01:02:09,416
You're a dancer, aren't you?
- Yes, how did you know?

823
01:02:10,259 --> 01:02:12,352
I know everything.
Please go there

824
01:02:12,495 --> 01:02:15,430
But I'm not a dancer. . .
- So what are you doing here? Move

825
01:02:15,531 --> 01:02:17,465
But. . .?
- Not a word now

826
01:02:18,301 --> 01:02:20,326
The director wants to see all dancers

827
01:02:20,436 --> 01:02:24,270
Very good ! Go immediately, Chutki. . .
- She'll go. . . you come with me

828
01:02:32,448 --> 01:02:34,348
Ms Simi, this will be
your hand position

829
01:02:38,488 --> 01:02:42,515
This is your position, Rajiv-ji.
Stay very close to Ms Simi

830
01:02:50,233 --> 01:02:52,394
Sir, can we bring
that girl up ahead?

831
01:02:53,236 --> 01:02:54,260
That one?
- Yes

832
01:02:59,542 --> 01:03:00,509
Me. . .?

833
01:03:02,311 --> 01:03:04,279
I can't understand
what you're saying

834
01:03:04,514 --> 01:03:06,448
He's asking you to come ahead

835
01:03:07,450 --> 01:03:08,417
All right

836
01:03:13,256 --> 01:03:14,314
I'm going to the monitor

837
01:03:15,258 --> 01:03:16,316
God help

838
01:03:32,341 --> 01:03:34,275
''You're the Prince of my heart''

839
01:03:34,410 --> 01:03:36,344
''I'm the Princess
of your heart''

840
01:03:36,479 --> 01:03:38,344
''You're what my love story
is all about. . .''

841
01:03:38,481 --> 01:03:41,245
''I'm what your love story
is all about''

842
01:03:48,357 --> 01:03:49,324
Fantastic!

843
01:03:52,361 --> 01:03:57,389
I stood there and saw the whole
thing Chutki. . . You were terrific!

844
01:03:57,533 --> 01:04:01,526
The girls also said I was good.
- The director also is very happy

845
01:04:03,372 --> 01:04:04,430
Roomi-ji's here!

846
01:04:07,310 --> 01:04:09,403
What are you doing here?
- This is incredible, Roomi-ji

847
01:04:10,246 --> 01:04:14,376
The director called me right ahead
and watched my dance. He loved it!

848
01:04:14,517 --> 01:04:17,384
Instead of the photo-shoot,
we came to the shoot directly!

849
01:04:18,254 --> 01:04:19,516
Looks like it will all happen now!

850
01:04:20,356 --> 01:04:23,450
The two of you are crazy!
When I've promised to help you. . .

851
01:04:24,293 --> 01:04:27,319
where's the need for you to
barge into someone's shoot like this?

852
01:04:27,430 --> 01:04:30,263
What rubbish !
The director himself called us

853
01:04:30,399 --> 01:04:32,333
And you needn't worry.
It's all going to work out now. . .

854
01:04:32,368 --> 01:04:35,428
You shut up, okay? You want to make
her a heroine or a junior artiste?

855
01:04:38,241 --> 01:04:39,401
Junior. . . what?

856
01:04:39,508 --> 01:04:42,477
The crowd ! Look there.
The one ahead is the heroine

857
01:04:43,279 --> 01:04:45,338
The girls behind her, where you were,
are called junior artistes

858
01:04:46,249 --> 01:04:48,410
Once you get known
as a junior artiste. . .

859
01:04:48,484 --> 01:04:50,418
no one will cast you as
the heroine, all your life

860
01:04:50,486 --> 01:04:52,511
You understand?

861
01:04:54,490 --> 01:04:56,355
Just leave quickly now!

862
01:04:59,362 --> 01:05:02,422
Raja, when you don't know anything,
why do you mess up things?

863
01:05:03,299 --> 01:05:05,460
What would have happened
if Roomi-ji hadn't arrived here?

864
01:05:06,235 --> 01:05:07,497
Let's go now. . . c'mon

865
01:05:10,306 --> 01:05:13,469
I diotic director. Doesn't even know
how take a shot, just keeps yelling. . .

866
01:05:14,310 --> 01:05:15,538
One moment, eX cuse me?

867
01:05:16,345 --> 01:05:19,508
Stay close, in the next shot,
you're right behind the heroine

868
01:05:20,416 --> 01:05:22,441
Not behind the heroine!
I'm here to become one myself!

869
01:05:23,252 --> 01:05:24,480
I don't want anything of this. . .
let's go, Raja

870
01:05:25,254 --> 01:05:28,348
One moment. . . you're part of
continuity now. You can't go away

871
01:05:28,491 --> 01:05:30,425
Continnn. . . what?

872
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:33,421
Sir, it's a mistake. Forgive us. . .
- Don't you utter a word !

873
01:05:33,529 --> 01:05:36,464
You've done enough already.
Let's get out of here, quick

874
01:05:37,233 --> 01:05:39,428
One moment. . . I've just
taken up this job and. . .

875
01:05:40,269 --> 01:05:42,396
if you're not around in the next shot,
the director's going to kill me!

876
01:05:42,471 --> 01:05:46,305
Bablu. . . what's happening here?
- Nothing, sir. She wants to leave. . .

877
01:05:46,442 --> 01:05:48,307
So just talk to the junior artiste
supplier Bhalla,

878
01:05:48,377 --> 01:05:49,537
why are you hassling me about it?

879
01:05:50,379 --> 01:05:54,440
Director-sir. . . she's not a junior.
Neither does she want to be one

880
01:05:55,318 --> 01:05:56,512
So what does she want to be?
The heroine?

881
01:05:57,320 --> 01:05:58,480
Yes! You've got it right

882
01:05:58,521 --> 01:06:00,386
That's eXactly why I brought
her here to meet you

883
01:06:00,489 --> 01:06:02,423
Chutki, come and talk to him

884
01:06:03,259 --> 01:06:04,521
Why did you put her in the frame?!
- Sir. . .

885
01:06:05,294 --> 01:06:07,455
You called for her and Mr. Bhalla
gave her the position, sir

886
01:06:08,297 --> 01:06:10,390
Me? Where the hell is Bhalla?
Bhalla !

887
01:06:12,234 --> 01:06:13,496
Why did you put her into the frame?

888
01:06:14,303 --> 01:06:17,500
Sir Bablu had called her.
And you told me to give her a position

889
01:06:18,374 --> 01:06:20,433
That's not my headache. . . and what
the hell were you doing there?

890
01:06:21,243 --> 01:06:25,339
Director sir. . . please don't
get upset. . . Just hear me out. . .

891
01:06:25,481 --> 01:06:28,314
Instead of that girl in there,
you should use her, as the heroine

892
01:06:28,417 --> 01:06:32,251
She's a far better dancer.
You saw it and even praised it.

893
01:06:35,491 --> 01:06:37,288
Who on earth let them in ! ?

894
01:06:38,260 --> 01:06:40,524
Ask Bobby to find a replacement.
And post a production person here

895
01:06:41,330 --> 01:06:44,322
Don't let any cheapskate like them
get in ! You got that?

896
01:06:47,303 --> 01:06:50,363
He called me a cheapskate. No one's
going to cast me in their films now.

897
01:06:50,539 --> 01:06:52,404
Don't worry, Chutki. . .

898
01:06:53,242 --> 01:06:56,439
He's not the only director, and when
I've promised you a portfolio. . .

899
01:06:57,246 --> 01:06:58,338
what's your problem. . .?

900
01:06:58,447 --> 01:07:00,415
Just make sure you don't listen
to anyone else henceforth

901
01:07:00,483 --> 01:07:02,417
Now let's get out of here

902
01:07:10,493 --> 01:07:14,361
Wow! What a location ! It'll be lots
of fun to do a photo-session here!

903
01:07:14,497 --> 01:07:16,294
Nobody will disturb us

904
01:07:16,399 --> 01:07:19,425
Brother Roomi, couldn't we just click
some pictures at home, on the terrace

905
01:07:20,236 --> 01:07:23,399
Or even gone to a photo-studio?
- If you know all, why don't you do it!

906
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:27,403
The location, background are very
important for a portfolio, Chutki. . .

907
01:07:28,277 --> 01:07:30,404
Ask him not to bother me now!
- Raja, stay quiet now,

908
01:07:30,513 --> 01:07:33,448
Roomi-ji's right! So where do you
want to do the photo-session?

909
01:07:34,316 --> 01:07:35,408
Come with me, this way. . .

910
01:07:36,519 --> 01:07:39,352
This is eXactly why I didn't
want us to tag him along

911
01:07:39,488 --> 01:07:41,422
Watch it. . . careful

912
01:07:42,258 --> 01:07:44,522
Had we come on our own, this photo
session would've been a dream

913
01:07:45,361 --> 01:07:48,353
Don't mind him. That's how he is.
- But. . .

914
01:07:48,497 --> 01:07:50,397
Ask him not to disturb
my concentration

915
01:07:50,499 --> 01:07:53,366
Not a word from you, Raja.
Let us get to work. Just sit there

916
01:07:53,502 --> 01:07:55,367
Stay here, okay?

917
01:08:02,311 --> 01:08:04,438
Pull your hand together. . .
a bit lower, the other one

918
01:08:07,249 --> 01:08:08,307
Hold this

919
01:08:13,289 --> 01:08:14,517
Try another pose

920
01:08:16,258 --> 01:08:17,452
Your body arched. . .

921
01:08:19,428 --> 01:08:22,363
slide down the veil a bit. . .
that's better

922
01:08:30,306 --> 01:08:31,432
Turn this way. . .

923
01:08:34,243 --> 01:08:35,335
no, chin down. . .

924
01:08:42,251 --> 01:08:44,344
You look very beautiful

925
01:08:50,359 --> 01:08:52,520
Now let's try something different

926
01:08:54,430 --> 01:08:56,398
No. . . It's not working.
That magic is missing. . .

927
01:08:56,499 --> 01:08:58,467
Oh ! Your hair is getting blown away

928
01:09:01,504 --> 01:09:03,495
A bit upwards. . . like this

929
01:09:05,241 --> 01:09:06,503
Chutki, let's go

930
01:09:07,409 --> 01:09:10,378
How can we do anything if
you keep interrupting, Raja?

931
01:09:10,513 --> 01:09:12,447
You are pissing him off now. . .

932
01:09:13,249 --> 01:09:14,511
We've got enough pictures already. . .
- Not at all, Raja.

933
01:09:15,317 --> 01:09:17,285
We just about got started. . .
- Chutki. . . one moment.

934
01:09:17,386 --> 01:09:19,513
Raja, sit down.
We've got work to do

935
01:09:20,356 --> 01:09:22,324
Enough, brother Roomi.
- Didn't I just ask you to sit down?

936
01:09:22,424 --> 01:09:24,449
You've taken 5 or 7 pictures already.
That's enough. Let's go, Chutki

937
01:09:25,294 --> 01:09:27,524
Just sit there! Ok?
- Don't touch me, brother Roomi

938
01:09:28,364 --> 01:09:31,527
Touch you. . . ! ? What are you
going to do, if I do?

939
01:09:32,434 --> 01:09:35,494
I swear I'll break your head !
- Raja ! Put that stone down !

940
01:09:37,239 --> 01:09:39,503
Put that stone down. . .
Ask him to put it away!

941
01:09:40,376 --> 01:09:44,403
Are you mad? Throw it away!
- Raja, throw that stone away

942
01:09:45,281 --> 01:09:47,249
This is it, Raja !
I'm leaving !

943
01:09:51,253 --> 01:09:53,380
Let him go. . .

944
01:09:55,257 --> 01:09:56,519
Let's go

945
01:09:57,459 --> 01:09:59,324
You didn't have to, Roomi-ji !

946
01:10:00,362 --> 01:10:02,455
How dare he threaten
a future star with a stone!

947
01:10:03,532 --> 01:10:06,365
It wasn't my fault!
- Then whose was it?

948
01:10:06,502 --> 01:10:11,337
If I hadn't stopped Roomi-ji,
you'd have been in hospital right now!

949
01:10:13,242 --> 01:10:17,338
No sit still. . . It's just a bruise,
should be ok, by tomorrow

950
01:10:18,347 --> 01:10:20,440
You know how much we need Roomi-ji?

951
01:10:21,417 --> 01:10:24,409
And you threatened to break his head?
- I only stopped because of you

952
01:10:25,254 --> 01:10:27,415
I'd have just gone for it!
- So go and break his head !

953
01:10:28,257 --> 01:10:29,519
Break his legs also

954
01:10:30,392 --> 01:10:32,519
Whether portfolio is done or not,
whether I get any work or not. . .

955
01:10:33,362 --> 01:10:35,296
What do you care?
- But. . .

956
01:10:35,364 --> 01:10:36,422
But, what. . .?

957
01:10:37,233 --> 01:10:39,497
Do you know? how embarrassed
I'll now be to face Roomi-ji?

958
01:10:41,237 --> 01:10:43,262
He'll never ever help me now!

959
01:10:44,406 --> 01:10:46,465
What will happen of me?
- Why do you think like this?

960
01:10:47,276 --> 01:10:49,335
How else am I supposed to think?
There was just one person. . .

961
01:10:49,478 --> 01:10:52,345
who could help us and
you've driven even him away!

962
01:11:10,232 --> 01:11:12,325
Where were you all day?
You could've at least told me!

963
01:11:12,468 --> 01:11:14,436
Our work is done!
- What work, Raja?

964
01:11:15,237 --> 01:11:17,330
I've found the solution
to all our problems

965
01:11:18,274 --> 01:11:21,402
Just consider yourself a big heroine!
- You've gone crazy, Raja !

966
01:11:22,244 --> 01:11:24,337
Oh no, not at all !

967
01:11:24,513 --> 01:11:26,481
I spent the whole day getting
to know the film industry today. . .

968
01:11:27,249 --> 01:11:28,409
from the stem to the root!

969
01:11:28,450 --> 01:11:30,441
We needn't depend on Roomi
or anyone else anymore

970
01:11:31,253 --> 01:11:33,221
Roots?! Stems?! What the hell
are you talking about?

971
01:11:33,322 --> 01:11:34,414
Will you get to the point?

972
01:11:35,257 --> 01:11:38,522
Most of the film-makers either
work with only the big stars. . .

973
01:11:39,361 --> 01:11:43,422
or only with star kids.
- Is that something to be happy about?

974
01:11:43,499 --> 01:11:47,526
The good news is that there are
just a couple of film-makers. . .

975
01:11:48,337 --> 01:11:50,305
who choose to work
only with newcomers

976
01:11:50,372 --> 01:11:52,363
One of them is Kapil Arya

977
01:11:53,242 --> 01:11:56,405
Kapil Arya. . .? Oh yes,
he made that movie last year

978
01:11:57,246 --> 01:11:59,510
What was it called. . .? ''The Train'' !
Nice film, we've seen it, remember?

979
01:12:00,349 --> 01:12:02,317
He made so many careers in
just one stroke

980
01:12:02,418 --> 01:12:05,387
I've got all the information on him.
He's starting another film. . .

981
01:12:05,487 --> 01:12:07,455
and he's on the lookout
for newcomers!

982
01:12:08,257 --> 01:12:10,350
Both, the timing and the person
are right, Chutki !

983
01:12:10,492 --> 01:12:13,256
That's all right. But how
will we meet him?

984
01:12:13,395 --> 01:12:15,420
And how will I convince him
about my talent?

985
01:12:16,231 --> 01:12:18,495
Just one look and he can
see an artist, Chutki

986
01:12:19,368 --> 01:12:22,337
I've even got his address.
We'll go there tomorrow

987
01:12:22,471 --> 01:12:25,497
Take it from me. Once he
meets you. . . it will be enough

988
01:12:27,276 --> 01:12:30,473
Raja, maybe he's the only one
who can do something for me now

989
01:12:33,415 --> 01:12:35,349
''Speed-breaker ahead''

990
01:12:35,484 --> 01:12:37,509
It's supposed to be
the third bungalow. . .

991
01:12:40,289 --> 01:12:41,278
There!

992
01:12:44,293 --> 01:12:46,261
Yes, that's the one.
Let's go, hurry

993
01:12:49,231 --> 01:12:53,292
We wish to meet Mr Kapil Arya.
- He's not in

994
01:12:53,469 --> 01:12:55,437
Who wants to meet him?
- She has to meet him

995
01:12:55,537 --> 01:12:57,368
Is it regarding acting?

996
01:12:57,473 --> 01:13:00,340
Leave your photographs here.
We'll call you back

997
01:13:00,476 --> 01:13:03,377
We don't have a phone or photographs.
- We have no photographs. . .

998
01:13:03,479 --> 01:13:05,447
so it's necessary that
she meets him personally

999
01:13:05,481 --> 01:13:07,449
Mr Kapil Arya does not
have a fiX ed routine

1000
01:13:08,250 --> 01:13:10,445
If he owns such a big office here,
he'll definitely come some time!

1001
01:13:11,320 --> 01:13:13,515
We'll stand here all day, if we
have to. . . we have to meet him

1002
01:13:14,289 --> 01:13:16,484
But he doesn't meet anyone like this.
- How does he meet then?

1003
01:13:17,393 --> 01:13:20,487
That's his car. . .
please clear out. Open the gates!

1004
01:13:24,299 --> 01:13:27,359
The moment the car stops, rush ahead
to him and tell him everything

1005
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:32,502
Without fear, tell him everything
very clearly about yourself

1006
01:13:33,375 --> 01:13:35,502
I've reached the office already.
You can give me a call later

1007
01:13:40,349 --> 01:13:42,442
What have you done? He is gone. . .
and you didn't say a word to him !

1008
01:13:43,252 --> 01:13:44,514
You're such a chatterboX otherwise!
- But he didn't even notice me

1009
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:47,515
How would he? He doesn't know you !
You should have spoken to him

1010
01:13:48,390 --> 01:13:52,349
Why didn't you say something?
- I was waiting for you to speak. . .

1011
01:13:52,494 --> 01:13:56,362
and you let this opportunity slip.
- You've been called inside. . .

1012
01:13:56,532 --> 01:13:59,296
Let's go, Chutki !
- Not her, you

1013
01:13:59,368 --> 01:14:00,335
Me?
- Yes

1014
01:14:00,436 --> 01:14:01,494
First, the agent is spoken to.
- Agent?

1015
01:14:02,237 --> 01:14:05,434
C'mon, hurry up! Go on ! Go!
- You stay here

1016
01:14:12,414 --> 01:14:17,374
Not to worry. Whoever enters these
gates, never returns unhappy

1017
01:14:17,486 --> 01:14:19,386
The job is done!

1018
01:14:29,231 --> 01:14:29,492
What happened?

1019
01:14:30,299 --> 01:14:34,497
I told him everything about
your talent, your dancing ability. . .

1020
01:14:35,370 --> 01:14:38,430
I told him everything.
They even discussed money. . .

1021
01:14:42,244 --> 01:14:44,303
They have cast ME instead !

1022
01:15:19,281 --> 01:15:20,475
Whom do you wish to see?
- Mr Asif

1023
01:15:27,256 --> 01:15:28,450
Sir. . .
- Come in

1024
01:15:34,463 --> 01:15:38,229
Sir, could I have
5 minutes with you please?

1025
01:15:38,433 --> 01:15:40,367
Any problem?
- No, sir

1026
01:15:40,435 --> 01:15:43,336
Actually, sir. . . she's the one
we came here for

1027
01:15:45,274 --> 01:15:48,402
She has so much of talent, sir. . .
it's just amazing

1028
01:15:49,278 --> 01:15:51,473
People here don't know about it,
but back in Gajrolla. . .

1029
01:15:52,281 --> 01:15:55,250
everyone comes to see her perform.
- Really?

1030
01:15:55,450 --> 01:16:00,251
I have a request, sir. Please
cast her as the heroine in your film

1031
01:16:01,356 --> 01:16:03,415
All right. Leave her
pictures with Leora outside

1032
01:16:03,492 --> 01:16:05,357
If something comes up,
we'll let you know

1033
01:16:05,427 --> 01:16:07,395
What will come up
and when, sir. . .?

1034
01:16:07,496 --> 01:16:11,227
Cast her in the film you
are making now sir

1035
01:16:12,267 --> 01:16:15,464
Raja, it doesn't work like that.
The movie I'm making. . .

1036
01:16:16,271 --> 01:16:20,230
So how does it work, sir? We have
come to you with great hopes, sir

1037
01:16:20,375 --> 01:16:26,280
Sir, just ''fit'' her in your film, sir.
It'll be a great hit

1038
01:16:26,415 --> 01:16:29,384
Look, you're wasting
our time and your own. . .

1039
01:16:31,286 --> 01:16:34,346
Raja, the casting of
this film is complete

1040
01:16:34,489 --> 01:16:37,322
And we don't have a heroine's part
in this film

1041
01:16:37,426 --> 01:16:41,260
To have or not have a part
is all in your hands, sir

1042
01:16:41,430 --> 01:16:44,422
And besides what's a movie
without a heroine!

1043
01:16:45,267 --> 01:16:49,226
Raja, let's go.
- Hang on

1044
01:16:49,404 --> 01:16:53,238
Sir, I don't know any acting.
Drop me from the film. . .

1045
01:16:53,375 --> 01:16:55,309
and cast her instead

1046
01:16:57,346 --> 01:16:59,473
Let's go out and talk it over.
I'll help you understand, Raja

1047
01:17:00,248 --> 01:17:03,376
One moment. . . he's the one
who needs to understand, not me

1048
01:17:04,252 --> 01:17:07,221
Sir, the stuff she's got,
no other girl can ever have!

1049
01:17:08,423 --> 01:17:12,223
Really? And what does she have?

1050
01:17:13,428 --> 01:17:16,226
You want to make ME understand,
isn't it? Go ahead. . .

1051
01:17:16,431 --> 01:17:19,229
The stuff you are talking about
How come I don't see it?

1052
01:17:20,268 --> 01:17:22,327
I wonder what world
you folks live in !

1053
01:17:22,504 --> 01:17:26,235
What did you think?
A few people applause. . .

1054
01:17:26,441 --> 01:17:28,375
and she should become the heroine?

1055
01:17:28,477 --> 01:17:31,446
Do you have any idea how many girls
come to this office every day. . .

1056
01:17:32,314 --> 01:17:33,474
to become heroines?

1057
01:17:34,249 --> 01:17:35,443
I don't see anything special in her

1058
01:17:37,252 --> 01:17:39,447
They just form dreams and come here. . .

1059
01:17:40,288 --> 01:17:42,449
eXpecting us to waiting here. . .
to fulfill their dreams

1060
01:17:44,526 --> 01:17:46,460
Nobody wants to see the truth

1061
01:17:46,528 --> 01:17:51,465
Sir, I'm sorry for the insolence,
but all I'd like to say is. . .

1062
01:17:52,267 --> 01:17:55,236
if you give her a break. . .

1063
01:17:55,370 --> 01:17:57,338
if you are kind enough. . .

1064
01:17:58,273 --> 01:18:00,241
she'll leave all
the heroines behind

1065
01:18:04,279 --> 01:18:06,247
And make sure they don't
come to this office again

1066
01:18:06,381 --> 01:18:08,474
All I was saying. . .

1067
01:18:09,384 --> 01:18:12,353
Please come with me. . . come.
You needn't be disheartened. . .

1068
01:18:34,509 --> 01:18:40,277
Kapil Arya is a big man.
He makes such great movies

1069
01:18:46,354 --> 01:18:49,414
He must be right. . .
- What right?! All wrong, Chutki

1070
01:18:50,258 --> 01:18:52,453
He sees girls every day, Raja. . .
- Who does he see?

1071
01:18:53,261 --> 01:18:56,230
He knows nothing !
- You don't understand Raja !

1072
01:18:56,364 --> 01:18:59,231
Talent flows from the heart, Chutki.
Is not in the face!

1073
01:18:59,501 --> 01:19:01,469
And that's all he saw. . .

1074
01:19:02,370 --> 01:19:06,238
Nobody is able to see
your sincerity, your talent. . .

1075
01:19:06,408 --> 01:19:08,376
They've been judging you by your looks

1076
01:19:09,411 --> 01:19:11,436
So what's wrong with my looks?
I look fine. . .

1077
01:19:11,546 --> 01:19:17,246
You are very beautiful ! But they've
not understood your simplicity

1078
01:19:19,254 --> 01:19:23,213
I feel, to get work,
you must look a little modern

1079
01:19:27,262 --> 01:19:29,230
I don't know, Raja. . .

1080
01:19:30,298 --> 01:19:31,356
Just see. . .

1081
01:19:37,272 --> 01:19:39,467
that's how even ordinary girls
dress up in this city

1082
01:19:43,278 --> 01:19:46,338
You'll have to change your
appearance a bit, Chutki

1083
01:19:48,517 --> 01:19:55,252
But this will need a lot of money,
Raja. And we don't have any. . .

1084
01:19:55,357 --> 01:19:57,325
Just don't worry about the money!

1085
01:19:58,260 --> 01:20:01,286
I'll go to the village tomorrow
and make all the arrangements

1086
01:20:02,264 --> 01:20:03,458
How can you go back. . .?
What if your father. . .

1087
01:20:04,266 --> 01:20:06,234
Just don't think about all that. . .

1088
01:20:06,401 --> 01:20:08,335
I'll be back, before you know it.

1089
01:20:17,312 --> 01:20:20,440
You'll take care, won't you?
- I'm getting worried about you

1090
01:20:21,249 --> 01:20:24,309
You'll be all alone.
- I'll be home all day, don't worry

1091
01:20:25,387 --> 01:20:28,379
Raja, you'll convince your father,
won't you?

1092
01:20:29,357 --> 01:20:31,484
At least this much advantage I will
take, of being the only son, Chutki

1093
01:20:32,260 --> 01:20:34,353
Don't worry and look after yourself

1094
01:20:36,431 --> 01:20:39,298
Do you want me to convey a message
to Manju or your folks?

1095
01:20:39,501 --> 01:20:42,368
We haven't even called home
since we've come

1096
01:20:43,271 --> 01:20:45,398
Tell my parents and Manju. . .

1097
01:20:45,507 --> 01:20:49,238
that I'll call at Khilona's father
shop on Saturday night at nine

1098
01:20:49,344 --> 01:20:50,402
All right.
- Don't forget

1099
01:20:50,478 --> 01:20:52,343
It's okay. I must leave now

1100
01:20:56,318 --> 01:20:58,445
Raja. . . you will come back,
won't you?

1101
01:21:02,390 --> 01:21:05,223
Of course, I will.
Look after yourself

1102
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:07,260
Take care

1103
01:21:19,474 --> 01:21:21,442
Did you see Amitabh Bachchan?
- No

1104
01:21:22,310 --> 01:21:24,403
Aishwarya Rai?
- From a distance

1105
01:21:24,512 --> 01:21:26,446
Did you get to touch her?
- Stop it!

1106
01:21:26,514 --> 01:21:31,281
Your father's also going to ask
why you didn't bring Chutki along

1107
01:21:31,453 --> 01:21:34,388
Things are just beginning to settle
down, Mother. How could I bring her?

1108
01:21:34,456 --> 01:21:35,423
All right, come along

1109
01:21:35,490 --> 01:21:37,481
Have the trucks left?
- Long ago, sir

1110
01:21:38,260 --> 01:21:39,454
The rest of the bricks,
are they already in the kiln?

1111
01:21:39,527 --> 01:21:41,392
Yes, sir.
- Listen. . .

1112
01:21:41,463 --> 01:21:43,397
I ook who's here!
- Father. . .

1113
01:21:43,498 --> 01:21:46,490
Raja ! You're back?
Bless you !

1114
01:21:47,469 --> 01:21:50,336
What is this, no letter, no call?

1115
01:21:50,472 --> 01:21:54,340
There was so much to do in Bombay. . .
- Any way. . . I'm glad you're back

1116
01:21:54,509 --> 01:21:57,444
Take a look. There is a huge
charitable home being built in Billai

1117
01:21:58,280 --> 01:22:00,475
They're using our bricks.
The contractor Hariprasad. . .

1118
01:22:01,249 --> 01:22:04,218
is very happy with our product.
He says they're of eX cellent quality!

1119
01:22:05,253 --> 01:22:07,346
Now that you're back,
you must look after it

1120
01:22:07,489 --> 01:22:11,323
Employ Khilona too. He keeps
loafing around all day

1121
01:22:12,260 --> 01:22:14,455
Why haven't you brought your wife?
She'd have loved to see this

1122
01:22:15,263 --> 01:22:18,391
Chutki is back there in Bombay.
He's here only for a few days

1123
01:22:18,500 --> 01:22:21,469
For a few days. . .? What does it mean?
And she's there! ? All alone! ?

1124
01:22:22,237 --> 01:22:24,398
It was necessary to leave
her back there, father

1125
01:22:24,539 --> 01:22:27,235
One has to dig his feet
there in the city

1126
01:22:27,342 --> 01:22:29,242
So you've come, to go back?

1127
01:22:29,377 --> 01:22:31,436
Then why didn't the two of return once
and for all, after your work finished?

1128
01:22:32,280 --> 01:22:35,249
Father, actually I need some money

1129
01:22:36,484 --> 01:22:38,418
More money? What for?

1130
01:22:38,486 --> 01:22:41,284
In Bombay I discovered, different
things from different places. . .

1131
01:22:41,389 --> 01:22:45,450
are very famous. Bananas from
Bhusaval, oranges from Nagpur. . .

1132
01:22:46,261 --> 01:22:48,229
apples from Kulu,
rice from Saharanpur. . .

1133
01:22:48,330 --> 01:22:50,298
grapes from Nashik!
- Yes, etc. etc.

1134
01:22:50,465 --> 01:22:51,432
So?

1135
01:22:52,300 --> 01:22:54,325
We could grow all these
right here in Gajrolla !

1136
01:22:55,270 --> 01:22:56,237
How?

1137
01:22:56,338 --> 01:22:58,499
If the soil here is miX ed with
the ingredients of those lands. . .

1138
01:22:59,274 --> 01:23:00,502
we'll have an equally
nice harvest, father

1139
01:23:01,343 --> 01:23:03,436
Really? How is that possible?

1140
01:23:04,279 --> 01:23:06,440
It'll just cost some more money
for the training. . .

1141
01:23:06,514 --> 01:23:08,448
but you can watch the wonders then

1142
01:23:09,250 --> 01:23:11,218
His enthusiasm seems quite honest. . .

1143
01:23:11,319 --> 01:23:14,379
Father, I brought this for you

1144
01:23:15,256 --> 01:23:17,224
What is it?
- Dark glasses

1145
01:23:17,525 --> 01:23:19,459
Oh ! It's very sunny nowadays

1146
01:23:20,261 --> 01:23:23,230
Wow! it feels like evening now

1147
01:23:23,398 --> 01:23:26,367
Looks great on you, father.
- You want more money, right?

1148
01:23:27,268 --> 01:23:29,236
Come, let's go home

1149
01:23:35,410 --> 01:23:37,469
When I'm clean shaven,
they say I look very soft. . .

1150
01:23:38,279 --> 01:23:40,247
when I grow a beard,
they say, I look negative

1151
01:23:40,315 --> 01:23:42,215
Can't understand what
I should do get work?

1152
01:23:42,350 --> 01:23:44,341
Carry a cell-phone.
- What?

1153
01:23:45,253 --> 01:23:47,278
Cell-phone?
And who will pay the bills?

1154
01:23:47,389 --> 01:23:50,222
You moron, how will there be
any bills without a SIM card?

1155
01:23:50,392 --> 01:23:53,418
Whenever you go meet people for work,
pretend to be busy on the cell-phone

1156
01:23:54,262 --> 01:23:57,356
See what an impression you make.
Work will come pouring in

1157
01:23:58,400 --> 01:24:00,459
You couldn't make an impression
on an ordinary village belle. . .

1158
01:24:01,269 --> 01:24:02,463
and here, you talk big !

1159
01:24:04,272 --> 01:24:06,240
None of your charms worked on her,
I must say. . .

1160
01:24:06,374 --> 01:24:08,342
You seem to have lost
your touch man !

1161
01:24:09,310 --> 01:24:11,471
I'm told that the midget
has walked out on her

1162
01:24:12,380 --> 01:24:15,349
What are you saying?!
- That's what I heard

1163
01:24:16,251 --> 01:24:19,220
Watch me now! I'm going
to make her MY heroine

1164
01:24:19,354 --> 01:24:21,219
Like hell he will !

1165
01:24:37,272 --> 01:24:38,398
Roomi-ji. . . you?

1166
01:24:40,275 --> 01:24:42,402
I was chatting with my friends
and we got talking about you

1167
01:24:42,510 --> 01:24:46,241
So I thought I'd check on you.
Where's Raja?

1168
01:24:46,414 --> 01:24:48,382
I'm all right and Raja
has gone to the village

1169
01:24:48,450 --> 01:24:50,213
Please come in

1170
01:24:50,418 --> 01:24:54,411
He'll return in 3-4 days.
It was something important

1171
01:24:55,256 --> 01:24:57,224
Please sit down.
I'll get water

1172
01:25:07,268 --> 01:25:11,227
The way Raja misbehaved with you
during the photo-shoot. . .

1173
01:25:11,473 --> 01:25:14,442
I apologise.
- But it wasn't your fault?

1174
01:25:15,310 --> 01:25:19,246
It was my fault. I shouldn't
have stooped to Raja's level

1175
01:25:20,248 --> 01:25:23,376
Unnecessarily fought.
Anyway, forget all that

1176
01:25:24,285 --> 01:25:26,412
So what else is happening?

1177
01:25:27,255 --> 01:25:31,453
Nothing's happening. Raja took me
to Mr Kapil Arya the other day. . .

1178
01:25:32,293 --> 01:25:33,453
That Kapil Arya's a fool !

1179
01:25:34,262 --> 01:25:36,230
I've been in this business
for over 2 years. . .

1180
01:25:36,297 --> 01:25:39,232
and I haven't even once gone to
meet him. Weird movies he makes.

1181
01:25:39,367 --> 01:25:41,460
I don't know how they work
- But Raja was saying. . .

1182
01:25:42,303 --> 01:25:45,397
If you're going to listen to Raja
you'll never become a heroine.

1183
01:25:46,274 --> 01:25:49,334
I can't understand how
you can even stay with Raja !

1184
01:25:53,515 --> 01:25:59,351
Now look Chutki. . .
We share the same objective

1185
01:26:00,255 --> 01:26:04,214
We share the same dream.
So why don't we struggle together?

1186
01:26:04,425 --> 01:26:08,225
I know so many big producers,
I go to their lavish parties

1187
01:26:08,496 --> 01:26:14,230
If I took you along. . .
the two of us. . .? Together. . .?

1188
01:26:16,304 --> 01:26:18,329
You do understand
what I'm saying, don't you?

1189
01:26:23,311 --> 01:26:26,246
Please go away, Roomi-ji. . .
- Why're you brushing my hand away?

1190
01:26:26,381 --> 01:26:29,248
Please leave.
- I'll change your life, Chutki !

1191
01:26:29,350 --> 01:26:31,443
Please go away.
- But what happened?

1192
01:26:32,353 --> 01:26:36,221
I don't know all that. Please leave.
- I'll make you a heroine!

1193
01:26:36,391 --> 01:26:39,292
I don't want anything. . .
please go away

1194
01:26:39,394 --> 01:26:43,387
You do understand and yet. . .?
- I don't know. Please leave

1195
01:26:44,265 --> 01:26:46,426
But what is the problem?
- I know nothing of all that. . .

1196
01:26:46,501 --> 01:26:48,469
please leave!
- At least hear me out

1197
01:26:49,270 --> 01:26:50,430
Please go away!

1198
01:26:51,306 --> 01:26:54,434
Go away, please. . .
please leave, Roomi-ji !

1199
01:26:55,376 --> 01:26:58,243
Go away!
- Why're you doing this. . .?

1200
01:27:05,253 --> 01:27:06,220
Go away!

1201
01:27:07,355 --> 01:27:10,347
What the hell. . . You. . . bloody!
- Go away!

1202
01:27:11,359 --> 01:27:12,485
You could've hurt me!

1203
01:27:13,261 --> 01:27:15,388
Are you crazy! ?
- Go away

1204
01:27:15,496 --> 01:27:17,225
I'm leaving !

1205
01:27:17,332 --> 01:27:19,493
Don't know why I've been wasting my
time with village bumpkins like you !

1206
01:27:20,335 --> 01:27:23,236
Are all you villagers crazy?
One picks up a stone. . .

1207
01:27:23,371 --> 01:27:26,431
and you, the scissors?
Who do you think you are?

1208
01:27:27,242 --> 01:27:30,234
Have you ever seen how you look?
You look like a bloody monkey!

1209
01:27:30,411 --> 01:27:33,209
You want to become a heroine?
You. . .?

1210
01:27:33,414 --> 01:27:35,405
You won't get work even
as a junior artiste!

1211
01:27:36,251 --> 01:27:38,412
What do you think you are?
Bloody illiterate villager!

1212
01:27:39,254 --> 01:27:42,280
Don't know how to talk,
don't know to dress. . .

1213
01:27:42,490 --> 01:27:44,481
every time people see you down. . .
they laugh at you !

1214
01:27:45,293 --> 01:27:48,228
I've just been calling
beautiful and gorgeous. . .

1215
01:27:48,363 --> 01:27:50,297
That too, because
I was hitting on you. . .

1216
01:27:50,398 --> 01:27:52,457
Just wanted to have a good time.
What else are you good for! ?

1217
01:27:53,268 --> 01:27:55,361
I come across thousands of girls
like you, everyday!

1218
01:27:55,503 --> 01:27:58,233
And you lash out
with scissors at me?!

1219
01:28:49,424 --> 01:28:50,391
Sister!

1220
01:28:52,260 --> 01:28:54,228
How are you?
- Manju. . .

1221
01:28:55,530 --> 01:28:57,464
I'm fine. How are you?

1222
01:28:57,498 --> 01:29:00,467
I'm fine, sis.
We miss you so much

1223
01:29:01,369 --> 01:29:04,236
But you don't miss me
in Bombay, do you?

1224
01:29:05,506 --> 01:29:08,441
Know what? We have a lot of
mangoes on our tree this season

1225
01:29:09,310 --> 01:29:14,407
And Sunita tried so much to raise
donations for a show

1226
01:29:15,249 --> 01:29:17,410
But they all said,
''What's a show without Chutki?''

1227
01:29:18,252 --> 01:29:22,211
Listen to the this one, sis.
You know Seema. . .?

1228
01:29:22,390 --> 01:29:24,290
her marriage has been fiX ed

1229
01:29:24,392 --> 01:29:26,360
She was asking me
if you would come

1230
01:29:26,494 --> 01:29:28,394
I told her that until your. . .

1231
01:29:29,263 --> 01:29:32,357
I mean, until Raja's work is not set,
she won't be able to come

1232
01:29:32,500 --> 01:29:34,468
Am I right, sis?

1233
01:29:35,403 --> 01:29:37,234
Yes, you're right, Manju.

1234
01:29:37,338 --> 01:29:39,397
Sis, tell me something about Bombay

1235
01:29:40,274 --> 01:29:43,368
Do you follow what I'm saying?
- What all to say, Manju?

1236
01:29:44,379 --> 01:29:47,405
It's such a big city,
there are so many people here. . .

1237
01:29:48,249 --> 01:29:50,217
I've seen so many shootings

1238
01:29:50,351 --> 01:29:52,444
Even met so many big people

1239
01:29:54,422 --> 01:29:58,256
I think, in a few days. . .
something might come through

1240
01:30:00,228 --> 01:30:01,422
Enough, you wretch !
Let me talk to her!

1241
01:30:01,529 --> 01:30:03,497
One minute, mother!
- How much will you make her spend?

1242
01:30:04,298 --> 01:30:05,390
Give it to me now!

1243
01:30:06,300 --> 01:30:09,269
Chutki. . . how are you, my child?

1244
01:30:09,370 --> 01:30:11,338
I'm okay, Mother. How are you?

1245
01:30:11,472 --> 01:30:14,441
We're all fine here.
But we miss you so much

1246
01:30:15,276 --> 01:30:17,471
Why didn't you come with Raja?
You could've also visited us

1247
01:30:18,279 --> 01:30:20,474
You're all alone in Bombay. . .
I get so worried

1248
01:30:21,516 --> 01:30:24,451
No, Mother. The people here are
very nice. Very helpful

1249
01:30:25,286 --> 01:30:28,221
Don't worry about me.
I'm all right

1250
01:30:28,356 --> 01:30:30,221
Very well. But look after yourself

1251
01:30:30,391 --> 01:30:32,416
One moment. Talk to your father

1252
01:30:33,261 --> 01:30:34,421
Hurry up!

1253
01:30:37,298 --> 01:30:40,233
Chutki. . . you have forgotten us

1254
01:30:42,437 --> 01:30:44,302
I feel as if. . .

1255
01:30:44,539 --> 01:30:47,337
it's been years since I saw you

1256
01:30:47,475 --> 01:30:50,239
You had left home in any case
but now you've gone so far away. . .

1257
01:30:53,281 --> 01:30:55,374
your father can't even
come to see you

1258
01:30:58,252 --> 01:31:00,220
But you're happy, I hope?

1259
01:31:03,257 --> 01:31:05,225
Why are you so quiet, Chutki?

1260
01:31:08,362 --> 01:31:10,330
Everything's all right, father

1261
01:31:10,431 --> 01:31:14,231
I'm so happy here, I don't feel
like returning to the village now

1262
01:31:16,270 --> 01:31:18,238
All right. I'll hang up now

1263
01:31:21,275 --> 01:31:26,235
I've told Raja to get you
to talk to us some times

1264
01:31:26,380 --> 01:31:27,347
Of course, father

1265
01:31:27,448 --> 01:31:28,415
Okay, dear?

1266
01:31:29,250 --> 01:31:32,344
Look after your health, father.
I'm okay

1267
01:31:32,487 --> 01:31:34,352
You must look after yourself too

1268
01:32:23,271 --> 01:32:24,397
Stop here

1269
01:32:29,443 --> 01:32:30,410
How much?

1270
01:32:31,412 --> 01:32:33,380
Chutki ! How have you been?
- Fine

1271
01:32:34,248 --> 01:32:35,306
Weren't you supposed
to come tomorrow?

1272
01:32:35,416 --> 01:32:37,384
As soon as Khilona got
my tickets done, I left

1273
01:32:37,518 --> 01:32:41,284
They're all missing you very much.
They were saying. . .

1274
01:32:41,389 --> 01:32:43,448
ever since you've left,
they haven't had a proper show!

1275
01:32:46,527 --> 01:32:48,358
How are your parents?

1276
01:32:48,462 --> 01:32:53,365
They're fine. I fed my father
such stories about Bombay. . .

1277
01:32:53,467 --> 01:32:56,265
that he gave me more money
than I had asked for

1278
01:32:56,437 --> 01:32:59,429
Look at the things they sent for you !
Your mother has sent laddoos. . .

1279
01:33:00,341 --> 01:33:03,208
my mother has sent pickles,
and a sari. . .

1280
01:33:03,311 --> 01:33:06,303
which you don't ever wear!
Paapads, kachoris. . .

1281
01:33:06,480 --> 01:33:09,347
Khilona, Manju, Sunita. . . everyone
came to see me off at the station

1282
01:33:09,517 --> 01:33:13,283
Manju and Sunita got into the train
and weren't prepared to get down

1283
01:33:16,357 --> 01:33:18,325
You're the only one who
believes in me, isn't it?

1284
01:33:20,461 --> 01:33:26,297
Raja, I know I have the talent.
But you are right. . .

1285
01:33:27,401 --> 01:33:31,269
unless I change my appearance,
no one else will see it.

1286
01:35:21,415 --> 01:35:23,315
You're wanted inside

1287
01:36:02,389 --> 01:36:06,485
One look at your personality,
and anyone would give you work

1288
01:36:07,394 --> 01:36:09,362
You don't need an agent

1289
01:36:10,397 --> 01:36:12,365
I'll tell you what. . .

1290
01:36:16,270 --> 01:36:18,238
Meet this gentleman

1291
01:36:18,439 --> 01:36:21,306
God willing, something
will work out for you.

1292
01:36:23,277 --> 01:36:24,539
I'll give you a call
after meeting him, sir

1293
01:36:25,279 --> 01:36:26,337
No! There's no need to call

1294
01:36:29,350 --> 01:36:31,215
Where do these people come from

1295
01:36:32,520 --> 01:36:34,283
Greetings, sir

1296
01:36:36,390 --> 01:36:38,358
I'm Raja. This is Chutki, sir

1297
01:36:40,528 --> 01:36:42,291
Please, take a seat

1298
01:36:47,401 --> 01:36:48,368
Yes?

1299
01:36:48,435 --> 01:36:50,403
We've heard so much
about you, Pyare-ji

1300
01:36:50,538 --> 01:36:53,302
Really. . .? Oh, that's just like that

1301
01:36:54,241 --> 01:36:57,369
Actually, we've been trying to get her
some work since a long time, sir

1302
01:36:58,245 --> 01:37:00,270
We're from Gajrolla, came here
to make her a film-heroine

1303
01:37:00,414 --> 01:37:02,473
But nobody told us
how to go about things

1304
01:37:03,417 --> 01:37:05,351
Have you worked before?

1305
01:37:05,419 --> 01:37:09,355
Whenever there was a festival
or a programme in our village. . .

1306
01:37:09,490 --> 01:37:11,321
I danced in all of them, sir

1307
01:37:11,458 --> 01:37:13,483
I am known as Madhuri DiXit
in the village

1308
01:37:14,261 --> 01:37:15,228
Really?

1309
01:37:17,364 --> 01:37:19,264
Let me see your palm

1310
01:37:19,366 --> 01:37:20,458
What
- Show him your palm

1311
01:37:34,348 --> 01:37:38,216
See, there is no dearth
of work in the industry. . .

1312
01:37:39,353 --> 01:37:41,321
but we should be clear
about one thing

1313
01:37:41,422 --> 01:37:45,358
I charge 5000 rupees every month
and 23.5 per cent on every assignment

1314
01:37:46,393 --> 01:37:49,294
5000 rupees every month and
23.5 per cent. . .?

1315
01:37:49,396 --> 01:37:51,261
I don't work for everyone

1316
01:37:51,398 --> 01:37:54,265
I don't work for
just about everyone

1317
01:37:54,401 --> 01:37:56,301
A lot many people come to me

1318
01:37:56,537 --> 01:38:01,372
You see these photos. . .?
They're all stars. And I've made them

1319
01:38:02,409 --> 01:38:05,276
I haven't seen even
one of them yet

1320
01:38:06,413 --> 01:38:08,472
A thousand films are released
every year. Do you see all of them?

1321
01:38:09,283 --> 01:38:11,251
Do you. . .?
- No, sir. Can't see all

1322
01:38:11,518 --> 01:38:14,316
They're stars in different regional
industries. . . Telugu, Kannada. . .

1323
01:38:14,455 --> 01:38:17,356
some are playing key roles
in soaps and some in ads. . .

1324
01:38:18,392 --> 01:38:20,451
That's not what he
meant to say

1325
01:38:23,430 --> 01:38:26,297
Please accept the money
for this month, Pyarelal-ji

1326
01:38:26,400 --> 01:38:28,459
And please do something for me. . .

1327
01:38:43,350 --> 01:38:44,374
Just order, sir

1328
01:38:45,352 --> 01:38:49,482
Consider it done, already.
I'll call you back. Good bye

1329
01:38:52,359 --> 01:38:54,327
Looks like our stars match well

1330
01:38:54,461 --> 01:38:57,259
You just paid me
and your work is done

1331
01:38:59,400 --> 01:39:03,302
It's an ad for a tooth-powder,
for an Indore-based company

1332
01:39:03,470 --> 01:39:05,495
Just a day's work,
and they'll even pay well

1333
01:39:09,343 --> 01:39:10,332
Pyarelal-ji. . .

1334
01:39:10,477 --> 01:39:13,446
she doesn't want to model
for a tooth-powder

1335
01:39:14,348 --> 01:39:16,373
She wants to become
a very big heroine

1336
01:39:19,286 --> 01:39:21,413
You can handle her work if you want to
and make a big heroine out of her

1337
01:39:22,256 --> 01:39:24,417
No, no. . .
- Here's the money. Take it

1338
01:39:24,525 --> 01:39:26,390
Take the money and go away

1339
01:39:26,493 --> 01:39:28,461
Please don't be angry,
Pyarelal-ji

1340
01:39:29,263 --> 01:39:32,232
Actually, we know nothing
about the film industry

1341
01:39:34,401 --> 01:39:38,269
All I know is that I want to
be a very good actress

1342
01:39:38,372 --> 01:39:40,237
I'm willing to work hard. . .

1343
01:39:40,407 --> 01:39:45,242
but I can't be doing something,
when my heart is not in it. . .?

1344
01:39:46,413 --> 01:39:50,281
We've come with great hopes.
Only you can do something for me

1345
01:39:58,392 --> 01:40:02,260
The minute I saw you, I knew. . .
there is something special about you

1346
01:40:03,430 --> 01:40:05,295
Don't worry

1347
01:40:05,532 --> 01:40:07,500
I'm sure something
will come up for you

1348
01:40:08,402 --> 01:40:11,303
I'll manage your work.
But remember one thing

1349
01:40:12,539 --> 01:40:15,372
Without my permission,
you don't meet anyone. . .

1350
01:40:15,509 --> 01:40:17,477
We won't even meet our neighbours!

1351
01:40:24,418 --> 01:40:27,285
Must be something important. . .
- Yes, let's see

1352
01:40:30,491 --> 01:40:33,358
Why're you yelling. . .?
Talk softly

1353
01:40:33,527 --> 01:40:35,358
I am talking softly. . .

1354
01:40:35,429 --> 01:40:37,488
It's been more than a week,
since we paid you the money. . .

1355
01:40:38,332 --> 01:40:40,300
You didn't do me a favour
by paying me, did you?

1356
01:40:40,467 --> 01:40:43,334
First of all, you make me hold on
for so long and increase my bill !

1357
01:40:43,537 --> 01:40:46,370
Talking to you is like. . .
where's Chutki?

1358
01:40:46,473 --> 01:40:49,271
Put her on the line.
- He's asking for you

1359
01:40:51,345 --> 01:40:52,437
Pyarelal-ji, this is Chutki here

1360
01:40:53,247 --> 01:40:55,340
Are you all right?
- I'm fine. . . how are you?

1361
01:40:55,449 --> 01:40:58,441
Chutki, you are destined to have
a lot work. . . lot of work

1362
01:40:59,286 --> 01:41:00,253
Yes?!

1363
01:41:00,354 --> 01:41:02,447
There's an offer of a music video

1364
01:41:03,357 --> 01:41:04,415
Video. . . what?

1365
01:41:04,491 --> 01:41:07,392
Don't you see songs on tv. . .?
Just like that. . .

1366
01:41:08,395 --> 01:41:10,363
It's an eX cellent song. . .
Terrific

1367
01:41:11,265 --> 01:41:13,324
You've got to be at
Prithvi Studio at 3

1368
01:41:13,434 --> 01:41:16,267
We'll discuss the rest there.
Is that okay?

1369
01:41:16,370 --> 01:41:18,338
That's okay, sir. . .
I will hang up now

1370
01:41:20,507 --> 01:41:23,340
What was he saying?
- You know Prithvi Studios. . .

1371
01:41:23,510 --> 01:41:25,478
we've got to be there at 3

1372
01:41:26,380 --> 01:41:29,315
He said it had something
to do with a music video

1373
01:41:29,416 --> 01:41:31,384
What is that?
Never heard of it

1374
01:41:31,518 --> 01:41:33,486
We'll get to know when we go there

1375
01:41:35,456 --> 01:41:39,290
Pyarelal-ji, not just a song,
Chutki needs a whole film

1376
01:41:39,393 --> 01:41:40,485
Looks like you don't understand

1377
01:41:41,295 --> 01:41:43,286
What's this, Pyarelal-ji. . .?
Just a song?

1378
01:41:44,364 --> 01:41:47,299
It's a super-hit song, Chutki !
It'll be a rage on TV, you'll see

1379
01:41:48,235 --> 01:41:51,432
And there's no better opportunity to
eXpose you to the whole film industry

1380
01:41:52,306 --> 01:41:54,274
Hello, Pyarelal-ji. . .
- Hello!

1381
01:41:57,411 --> 01:41:58,378
Hello

1382
01:41:59,446 --> 01:42:01,380
I'm Raja.
- Hello

1383
01:42:02,249 --> 01:42:03,375
Can you dance. . .?

1384
01:42:04,351 --> 01:42:06,285
Have you danced before?
- On several occasions. . .

1385
01:42:06,320 --> 01:42:08,379
Why don't you audition her?
We have no problems

1386
01:42:08,522 --> 01:42:10,285
Do what. . .?

1387
01:42:10,424 --> 01:42:12,517
I'll play the song.
It's a Madhuri DiXit number

1388
01:42:13,393 --> 01:42:15,361
You've got to dance just like her.
- Sure

1389
01:42:16,530 --> 01:42:18,464
Go on ! She has called you !

1390
01:42:21,401 --> 01:42:24,268
Don't you understand when to
talk and when not to?

1391
01:42:29,243 --> 01:42:31,302
Shall I start the music now?
Are you ready. . .?

1392
01:43:02,543 --> 01:43:06,502
''My anklets cast a spell. . .''

1393
01:43:07,314 --> 01:43:09,282
''they beckon you. . .''

1394
01:43:09,383 --> 01:43:12,352
''what am I to do. . .?''

1395
01:43:25,432 --> 01:43:27,366
She'll lip-sync with the lyrics

1396
01:43:29,303 --> 01:43:32,272
Get her dressed in the clothes
we got for the Centre Girl

1397
01:43:46,486 --> 01:43:48,477
Stay here.
I'll be back in a moment

1398
01:44:32,399 --> 01:44:34,333
Chutki. . . what's up?

1399
01:44:36,403 --> 01:44:38,371
Has someone said something to you?
- No

1400
01:44:38,438 --> 01:44:40,463
Now look, don't pay attention
to what anyone says

1401
01:44:41,341 --> 01:44:43,275
You're doing very well

1402
01:44:43,377 --> 01:44:45,470
Concentrate on yourself
and your work. . .

1403
01:44:46,480 --> 01:44:48,345
leave the rest to me

1404
01:45:09,269 --> 01:45:11,362
''My heart's pounding. . .''

1405
01:45:12,239 --> 01:45:15,265
''I'm on fire''

1406
01:45:22,482 --> 01:45:25,474
''My heart's pounding. . .''

1407
01:45:26,420 --> 01:45:29,287
''I'm on fire''

1408
01:45:30,390 --> 01:45:33,359
''Let go of my arm, my love. . .''

1409
01:45:34,294 --> 01:45:36,489
''do not pluck buds
that are yet to blossom. . .''

1410
01:45:51,511 --> 01:45:54,275
Mr Desai's making a film.
I'll put in a word for you

1411
01:45:55,515 --> 01:45:57,346
I'll talk to you later

1412
01:45:58,418 --> 01:46:00,283
Amrita-ji, how's she doing?

1413
01:46:00,387 --> 01:46:03,356
She's brilliant! She has gone
to change right now

1414
01:46:05,359 --> 01:46:07,327
It all fits.
- Didn't I tell you so?

1415
01:46:07,427 --> 01:46:10,294
I must leave now. Take care.
- I'll give you a call later

1416
01:46:11,431 --> 01:46:13,296
I'll stay here

1417
01:46:14,401 --> 01:46:17,302
All right. Sit all by yourself.
Don't talk to anyone, okay?

1418
01:46:17,537 --> 01:46:19,505
When she comes out
after finishing. . .

1419
01:46:20,307 --> 01:46:22,241
ask her to give me a call.
- Very well

1420
01:46:33,420 --> 01:46:35,320
Could you spare some tea. . .?

1421
01:47:05,419 --> 01:47:08,286
''That you have accepted me,
my love. . .''

1422
01:47:08,422 --> 01:47:11,482
''I've begun to dream
rosy dreams''

1423
01:47:12,426 --> 01:47:15,293
''The magic is working. . .''

1424
01:47:15,429 --> 01:47:19,229
''it's getting into my very being''

1425
01:47:26,440 --> 01:47:29,341
''These ties. . .''

1426
01:47:29,509 --> 01:47:32,273
''shall never be broken''

1427
01:47:33,480 --> 01:47:36,278
''My heart's pounding. . .''

1428
01:47:36,516 --> 01:47:39,349
''I'm on fire''

1429
01:48:27,267 --> 01:48:29,326
You were wonderful

1430
01:48:30,237 --> 01:48:31,499
It's going to look even better
after the edit

1431
01:48:32,305 --> 01:48:34,296
I'll discuss the payment
with Pyarelal-ji

1432
01:48:34,374 --> 01:48:35,341
All right

1433
01:48:40,413 --> 01:48:43,280
They're all so happy, Chutki !
- They loved it!

1434
01:48:43,416 --> 01:48:46,283
When I first went inside,
no one even spoke to me

1435
01:48:46,386 --> 01:48:48,354
But they were so happy
with my performance. . .

1436
01:48:48,388 --> 01:48:51,289
they were all praise for me!
- Everyone was talking about you

1437
01:48:51,424 --> 01:48:53,449
The director was very happy too.
- That's wonderful

1438
01:48:54,261 --> 01:48:56,320
Let's go home now, Raja.
My whole body's aching

1439
01:48:56,429 --> 01:48:58,397
Have a hot bath with salt then.
- But I'm hungry!

1440
01:48:58,532 --> 01:49:00,500
Let's go eat then
- Do we have something at home?

1441
01:49:01,334 --> 01:49:04,462
He has called us immediately.
He wouldn't say anything on the phone

1442
01:49:05,438 --> 01:49:07,372
It has to be something good

1443
01:49:07,474 --> 01:49:09,442
Don't waste anymore time, Chutki

1444
01:49:19,352 --> 01:49:21,252
Raja. . . say something !

1445
01:49:21,521 --> 01:49:24,490
What can I say. . .?
I can barely recognise you

1446
01:49:25,358 --> 01:49:27,258
Do I look good?

1447
01:49:27,527 --> 01:49:29,290
Very Beautiful

1448
01:49:29,396 --> 01:49:31,364
Let's go. Pyarelal-ji
must be waiting for us

1449
01:49:32,432 --> 01:49:36,459
Are you going out somewhere?
I was coming over for a cup of tea

1450
01:49:37,404 --> 01:49:39,429
Later, Soni-saab.
We've got to out right now

1451
01:49:40,240 --> 01:49:42,333
Let's go. We're getting late.
- All right

1452
01:49:45,412 --> 01:49:48,381
A twist in the tale. . .?
Let's see

1453
01:49:49,416 --> 01:49:53,284
No, they're shooting in Switzerland.
A 35-day outdoor schedule

1454
01:49:53,453 --> 01:49:55,250
Sit down, Chutki

1455
01:49:56,489 --> 01:50:00,289
If you wish, that Dev Kumar's son,
Rajdev. . .

1456
01:50:00,427 --> 01:50:02,486
I can send him if you'd like. . .

1457
01:50:04,297 --> 01:50:06,265
If no one knows him yet,
they will know him soon

1458
01:50:06,366 --> 01:50:09,267
His own film has started now.
He's going to be a star soon

1459
01:50:09,402 --> 01:50:13,338
Okay? So your inauguration
is all set!

1460
01:50:14,407 --> 01:50:16,272
Praise the Lord !

1461
01:50:23,416 --> 01:50:25,384
I have terrific news

1462
01:50:25,485 --> 01:50:28,283
The two of you will go mad with joy

1463
01:50:29,489 --> 01:50:33,220
There are talks of you being
cast in a very big film

1464
01:50:39,532 --> 01:50:43,298
What film. . .? Who is the producer
and director? The hero?

1465
01:50:50,410 --> 01:50:53,470
A production house from the south. . .
Making their first in Hindi

1466
01:50:54,414 --> 01:50:56,382
He has signed several top stars

1467
01:50:57,317 --> 01:51:00,480
Shah Rukh Khan, Sunny Deol,
Saif Ali, Hritik. . .

1468
01:51:01,388 --> 01:51:04,289
and he has chosen you
for the heroine's role

1469
01:51:05,425 --> 01:51:10,453
He saw your video album and said. . .
''Look! She's got the magic of Madhuri''

1470
01:51:15,402 --> 01:51:18,371
Didn't I tell you?
We're going to hit it off together

1471
01:51:18,438 --> 01:51:19,462
Oh yes

1472
01:51:20,440 --> 01:51:22,465
You've only got to go
and meet the producer now

1473
01:51:23,243 --> 01:51:24,210
All right

1474
01:51:24,310 --> 01:51:26,278
I've taken an appointment for
the day after tomorrow at eleven

1475
01:51:26,346 --> 01:51:28,314
All right.
- You needn't worry, Pyarelal-ji

1476
01:51:28,415 --> 01:51:30,474
I'll take her there
right on time

1477
01:51:31,418 --> 01:51:34,478
Pyarelal-ji, we don't know
how to thank you

1478
01:51:38,391 --> 01:51:40,359
That my commission
will take care of

1479
01:51:51,404 --> 01:51:53,463
There's something
about her face and eyes. . .

1480
01:51:57,343 --> 01:51:59,368
Hello, Pyarelal-ji.
- Hello

1481
01:51:59,512 --> 01:52:02,413
Venky-ji, here's your heroine.
Chutki

1482
01:52:03,316 --> 01:52:04,283
Hello

1483
01:52:08,388 --> 01:52:12,222
She's just as I had imagined,
Pyarelal-ji. . . absolutely perfect!

1484
01:52:14,294 --> 01:52:17,263
Once this film is released, the world
will know you as Roshni

1485
01:52:18,398 --> 01:52:19,422
Roshni. . . who?

1486
01:52:19,532 --> 01:52:21,500
Roshni. . . the ray of hope!

1487
01:52:22,302 --> 01:52:24,270
Roshni's the name
of the film, Chutki

1488
01:52:24,404 --> 01:52:26,463
And you play Roshni in the film.
- I see!

1489
01:52:29,409 --> 01:52:35,245
Chutki, this is your director.
N. Venkatesh. . . Venky-ji

1490
01:52:35,415 --> 01:52:37,383
Which other films has he made?

1491
01:52:38,418 --> 01:52:41,387
He has worked on the
biggest of projects down south

1492
01:52:42,455 --> 01:52:45,356
You know the film in which
Jayapradha got recognition. . .?

1493
01:52:45,525 --> 01:52:49,291
He made that film?!
- No, Venky was the clapper-boy then.

1494
01:52:49,395 --> 01:52:52,296
He's been in the business ever since
- So he hasn't made a film yet?

1495
01:52:52,398 --> 01:52:55,265
Didn't I say! He's been
in this field all these years

1496
01:52:56,469 --> 01:53:02,271
Venky-ji, you've done so much of work.
This is my very first film. . .

1497
01:53:02,408 --> 01:53:05,309
there will be so many big stars,
such renowned personalities. . .

1498
01:53:06,412 --> 01:53:08,471
Just don't worry

1499
01:53:09,349 --> 01:53:12,477
I have faith in you. And I have
faith in my team

1500
01:53:14,387 --> 01:53:17,288
It's time for the inaugural shot.
They're all waiting there. . .

1501
01:53:17,457 --> 01:53:20,324
Shah Rukh Khan, Amitji,
Saif-ji. . .

1502
01:53:20,426 --> 01:53:23,224
let's take pictures.
Hurry up, let's go

1503
01:53:24,531 --> 01:53:28,262
Saif-ji, Hritik-ji, Sachin saheb. . .
move a bit to your right sir

1504
01:53:29,402 --> 01:53:33,361
Shah Rukh saheb, Sunny Saheb. . .
move a bit to the left, please

1505
01:53:42,415 --> 01:53:46,374
Dilip saheb, Dev saheb. . .
come a bit closer, sir

1506
01:53:52,525 --> 01:53:55,289
Please make place
for the heroine

1507
01:53:58,398 --> 01:54:00,457
This is Chutki,
the heroine of our film

1508
01:54:02,402 --> 01:54:05,269
That's Sachin-ji

1509
01:54:06,406 --> 01:54:07,464
Jr Hritik-ji

1510
01:54:08,274 --> 01:54:09,263
Jr Saif-ji

1511
01:54:09,475 --> 01:54:11,238
Jr Bachchan saheb

1512
01:54:11,411 --> 01:54:12,378
Jr Dev saheb

1513
01:54:13,413 --> 01:54:14,437
Jr Dilip saheb

1514
01:54:14,547 --> 01:54:16,344
Jr Shah Rukh saheb

1515
01:54:16,416 --> 01:54:18,281
Jr Sunny saheb

1516
01:54:19,285 --> 01:54:20,252
And Jr Johny Lever saheb

1517
01:54:22,388 --> 01:54:25,255
Now, we'll click some pictures.
Hurry up, Swamiji

1518
01:54:28,394 --> 01:54:31,454
Pyarelal-ji, who are
all these men?

1519
01:54:32,498 --> 01:54:38,437
You said, there'll be Amitabh
Bachchan, Hritik and Shah Rukh

1520
01:54:39,339 --> 01:54:41,273
What all you said. . .

1521
01:54:41,441 --> 01:54:44,239
and all these are duplicates

1522
01:54:44,410 --> 01:54:47,379
Pyarelal-ji, is there any problem?
- Oh no, nothing sir

1523
01:54:47,513 --> 01:54:50,482
Please give everyone a 5-minute break.
Chutki will be right there

1524
01:54:51,417 --> 01:54:53,248
I'm not doing this!

1525
01:54:55,355 --> 01:54:57,289
What happened?
- Nothing, sir

1526
01:54:57,390 --> 01:54:59,255
Teething problems

1527
01:54:59,392 --> 01:55:02,259
Keep everything ready.
I'll just go get her

1528
01:55:07,533 --> 01:55:09,524
Chutki. . . listen to me

1529
01:55:11,237 --> 01:55:15,264
I don't want to talk to you !
- You'll have to listen to me, Chutki

1530
01:55:16,476 --> 01:55:19,377
How can you walk off just like that?
From the inaugural shoot. . .?

1531
01:55:19,479 --> 01:55:22,346
Is this the way you want to work! ?
- But you lied to me, Pyarelal-ji

1532
01:55:23,349 --> 01:55:25,476
No, Chutki. I did not lie to you

1533
01:55:26,319 --> 01:55:29,288
Yes, I hid the whole duplicates
thing from you. . .

1534
01:55:29,489 --> 01:55:32,458
it was more important
what you are doing in the film

1535
01:55:33,393 --> 01:55:35,452
The central character! The entire
story revolves around you

1536
01:55:36,229 --> 01:55:37,253
Isn't that a great thing?

1537
01:55:38,398 --> 01:55:40,457
Those duplicates are also actors. . .
they're artistes too

1538
01:55:41,401 --> 01:55:43,369
But they're all fake,
aren't they?

1539
01:55:44,237 --> 01:55:46,262
And why must Chutki work
with fakes?

1540
01:55:46,439 --> 01:55:49,306
How can anyone bring so many real
heroes together in one film?

1541
01:55:49,409 --> 01:55:52,344
To get two days, we'll have
to wait two years. . .

1542
01:55:54,414 --> 01:55:57,383
Now look, Chutki. I've spent
so many years in the industry

1543
01:55:58,251 --> 01:56:00,412
The moment I saw you,
I knew you could make it big

1544
01:56:00,520 --> 01:56:02,420
And that's eXactly why
I'm doing all this for you

1545
01:56:04,257 --> 01:56:06,282
Who'll go to see a film
like this?

1546
01:56:07,393 --> 01:56:10,453
Films with the biggest of stars fall on
their faces. No one goes to see them

1547
01:56:10,530 --> 01:56:11,497
However. . .

1548
01:56:12,465 --> 01:56:16,492
make a good film, with anyone. . .
and it succeeds. People come to see it

1549
01:56:17,370 --> 01:56:19,304
And I'm sure this will turn out
to be a good film. . .

1550
01:56:19,405 --> 01:56:21,464
it'll do well and
you will be spoken about

1551
01:56:22,475 --> 01:56:26,241
Do you have faith in yourself. . .?
Do you?

1552
01:56:26,412 --> 01:56:30,405
So then. . .? Just work hard
and concentrate on yourself

1553
01:56:30,516 --> 01:56:32,313
Leave the rest to me

1554
01:56:32,418 --> 01:56:34,477
You've got to start somewhere,
right?

1555
01:56:36,489 --> 01:56:39,481
If you still feel. . .
I have betrayed you. . .

1556
01:56:40,426 --> 01:56:43,327
you can decide.
We will not work together anymore

1557
01:56:43,463 --> 01:56:45,488
I think Pyarelal-ji is right, Chutki

1558
01:56:48,434 --> 01:56:50,493
So should we going in?

1559
01:56:53,539 --> 01:56:55,268
Let's go

1560
01:56:56,409 --> 01:56:58,468
Take positions, everybody!

1561
01:57:04,417 --> 01:57:05,475
Swami-ji. . . Click!

1562
01:57:21,501 --> 01:57:24,368
All three of you are
in love with Roshni

1563
01:57:24,504 --> 01:57:27,234
Wow! That's pretty
interesting !

1564
01:57:30,309 --> 01:57:33,437
None of you know who Roshni
is in love with

1565
01:57:34,347 --> 01:57:39,375
''What predicament is this
that cannot be solved?''

1566
01:57:42,388 --> 01:57:47,291
''My crazed heart
won't be placated''

1567
01:57:50,396 --> 01:57:52,455
''Come to me, my love. . .''

1568
01:57:53,366 --> 01:57:59,362
''my heart pines
to meet you''

1569
01:58:04,410 --> 01:58:07,277
I'm so happy, Papa !
Professor Natraj just told me. . .

1570
01:58:07,447 --> 01:58:11,281
that I've been chosen for
the Miracle Dance Competition

1571
01:58:11,417 --> 01:58:13,282
It's a load of nonsense!

1572
01:58:13,419 --> 01:58:16,252
Professor Natraj has
driven you out of your mind

1573
01:58:16,389 --> 01:58:21,326
He has driven you mad !
The one you keep calling ''Sir''. . .

1574
01:58:22,295 --> 01:58:24,354
has cowdung for brains!

1575
01:58:29,402 --> 01:58:31,233
You have retired. . .

1576
01:58:31,304 --> 01:58:33,465
but you haven't gotten over
the habit of delivering verdicts

1577
01:58:34,307 --> 01:58:36,207
This is our house,
it's not your courtroom

1578
01:58:40,513 --> 01:58:45,348
Just watch. My mobile's going to ring
and everyone's going to ask about you

1579
01:58:48,254 --> 01:58:51,280
''Say you love me. . .''

1580
01:58:51,491 --> 01:58:54,358
''that I'm the one
your heart desires''

1581
01:59:02,301 --> 01:59:04,531
''I'm crazy about you. . .''

1582
01:59:05,371 --> 01:59:08,499
''you are the only one
I wait for''

1583
01:59:10,343 --> 01:59:13,335
''Say you love me. . .''

1584
01:59:17,483 --> 01:59:19,451
In just a single take,
she speaks such lengthy lines

1585
01:59:20,386 --> 01:59:24,345
Chutki. . . this Mr Pradeep Sharma
and this is Ashish

1586
01:59:24,524 --> 01:59:27,288
They're into big films.
They were looking for a heroine. . .

1587
01:59:27,326 --> 01:59:29,351
for their next venture and
I brought them over

1588
01:59:29,495 --> 01:59:31,360
Vinod, ask me to face
anyone's bowling

1589
01:59:31,464 --> 01:59:34,262
Shoaib, McGrath or Donald. . .
I'm not scared

1590
01:59:34,400 --> 01:59:37,233
But when I go to tell Roshni
about how I feel. . .

1591
01:59:37,336 --> 01:59:39,304
I don't know why
I break into a cold sweat

1592
01:59:39,539 --> 01:59:43,373
You don't have to say anything. . .
I've heard it all

1593
01:59:44,243 --> 01:59:46,268
All the best. Don't be afraid.
- Wow!

1594
01:59:46,445 --> 01:59:49,346
If you can fall in love,
you must learn to eXpress it

1595
01:59:49,515 --> 01:59:53,212
Like I'm doing. . .
I love you

1596
02:00:03,429 --> 02:00:05,397
Why've you brought me here?
What harm have I done to you?

1597
02:00:05,531 --> 02:00:09,228
Balwant Rai's going to suffer. . .
for his daughter!

1598
02:00:09,335 --> 02:00:10,324
I'm not sparing anyone!

1599
02:00:10,403 --> 02:00:14,430
I won't let you go!
Not anyone in your family!

1600
02:00:24,417 --> 02:00:27,250
Look at this! A picture of Chutki
has been published in ''Mayapuri'' !

1601
02:00:28,387 --> 02:00:30,287
Show it to me. . .

1602
02:00:31,424 --> 02:00:37,294
The role I play is very similar
to what I am in real life

1603
02:01:05,524 --> 02:01:08,493
''The display of my talent. . .''

1604
02:01:09,395 --> 02:01:12,262
''shall send the world
in a tizzy''

1605
02:01:12,498 --> 02:01:15,490
''I know it for sure. . .''

1606
02:01:16,302 --> 02:01:19,362
''whatever town
or city it is. . .''

1607
02:01:19,538 --> 02:01:22,507
''I'm the one they're
going to sing about. . .''

1608
02:01:23,342 --> 02:01:25,503
''for I am the alluring moonlight. . .''

1609
02:01:26,345 --> 02:01:29,371
''I'm Roshni. . . ( the light)''

1610
02:01:53,406 --> 02:01:55,499
It's the fruit of
your hard work, Chutki

1611
02:02:00,246 --> 02:02:02,476
Just see. . . I once danced
at the shows in the village. . .

1612
02:02:04,250 --> 02:02:05,274
and today. . .?

1613
02:02:33,346 --> 02:02:34,313
Raja !

1614
02:02:36,515 --> 02:02:40,281
Is it okay?
- You're all decked up!

1615
02:02:40,419 --> 02:02:43,217
It's a big day, today. . .
I spent a good 2000 rupees!

1616
02:02:43,356 --> 02:02:46,382
And you're looking good too. Hurry up,
it's time for the show already

1617
02:02:47,293 --> 02:02:49,261
I'm missing my parents
and Manju so much !

1618
02:02:49,395 --> 02:02:52,262
How I wish they were here today
How I wish the whole village was here!

1619
02:02:52,398 --> 02:02:55,367
I was thinking of sending tickets
to everyone and calling them here

1620
02:02:55,501 --> 02:02:59,232
We won't go to Gajrolla
until Roshni releases there

1621
02:02:59,338 --> 02:03:01,306
Oh yes, it'll be so much of fun.
People will go crazy!

1622
02:03:05,411 --> 02:03:07,311
The later we get there the better.
You could get mobbed !

1623
02:03:07,413 --> 02:03:10,280
That's eXactly why I want. . .
There will so many people there, Raja

1624
02:03:10,516 --> 02:03:13,280
I was just about to come to your
place for some tea

1625
02:03:13,419 --> 02:03:15,387
Are you going to a wedding?
- No. . .

1626
02:03:15,421 --> 02:03:18,219
today's the first show
of my first film

1627
02:03:18,357 --> 02:03:21,224
And you can see me throughout the movie!
- We've got to leave

1628
02:03:28,401 --> 02:03:30,460
Mister, can't you drive
a bit faster, please?

1629
02:03:31,237 --> 02:03:32,204
Sure

1630
02:03:32,304 --> 02:03:34,465
That is why I've asked him to
take a shortcut, Chutki

1631
02:03:40,346 --> 02:03:42,246
You took the shortcut. . .
now what happened?

1632
02:03:42,348 --> 02:03:44,282
Not a problem, sir.
The theatre's right ahead

1633
02:03:44,383 --> 02:03:46,442
You'll get there faster
if you walk

1634
02:03:47,353 --> 02:03:49,287
Let's hurry.
- How much is the fare?

1635
02:03:49,355 --> 02:03:53,257
1 10 Rupees. . .
Are you really a heroine, madam?

1636
02:03:53,392 --> 02:03:55,417
Today's the first day
of my movie. . .''Roshni''

1637
02:03:56,228 --> 02:03:57,456
I'll certainly see
your movie, madam

1638
02:04:13,512 --> 02:04:16,276
So many films. . .
where is ''Roshni''?

1639
02:04:20,386 --> 02:04:22,251
Look at the poster there, Chutki !

1640
02:04:29,395 --> 02:04:33,297
People are recognising me, Raja !
- Obviously. . . walk a bit faster

1641
02:04:33,532 --> 02:04:34,499
C'mon !

1642
02:04:36,268 --> 02:04:38,327
Has the movie started?
- Yes, about ten minutes ago

1643
02:04:40,406 --> 02:04:42,374
The first time my name comes on
screen and I won't even get to see it!

1644
02:04:42,441 --> 02:04:44,306
We can see it again
and again, Chutki

1645
02:04:47,413 --> 02:04:49,347
There, Chutki. . .
You look so beautiful

1646
02:04:49,415 --> 02:04:51,349
Could you show us our seats, mister?
- Sit wherever you want to

1647
02:04:51,417 --> 02:04:53,351
The whole theatre's empty!

1648
02:04:54,520 --> 02:04:58,388
Why? Where is everyone. . .?
It's the very first show

1649
02:04:59,291 --> 02:05:01,486
It's clear in the very first show
if the film is a hit or a flop.

1650
02:05:02,394 --> 02:05:04,259
Sit wherever you want to

1651
02:05:20,479 --> 02:05:23,346
How would the usher know anything. . .?
There are so many people in here

1652
02:05:23,449 --> 02:05:25,280
They're enjoying the movie

1653
02:05:25,417 --> 02:05:29,285
Hey man. It's a lousy movie anyway
and you're making it worse!

1654
02:05:40,399 --> 02:05:42,367
Look at that. . . !

1655
02:05:45,404 --> 02:05:49,340
We've got to meet the guy
who made this movie!

1656
02:05:50,476 --> 02:05:52,341
Handpicked heroes, I say!

1657
02:05:56,348 --> 02:05:59,442
Forget that. You can't even tell
whose duplicate the heroine is!

1658
02:06:04,456 --> 02:06:06,321
Let me sleep, guys

1659
02:06:06,392 --> 02:06:09,361
Yes man. . . let him sleep. At least
someone is getting his money's worth

1660
02:06:13,232 --> 02:06:14,324
Sway those hips!

1661
02:06:17,403 --> 02:06:21,237
She's acting as if
she were facing a real hero!

1662
02:06:27,379 --> 02:06:30,473
Look at her smiling !

1663
02:06:34,386 --> 02:06:37,253
Let's go, guys.
- Sit down. . .

1664
02:06:37,389 --> 02:06:39,357
let's enjoy the air-conditioning
for some time

1665
02:06:39,525 --> 02:06:43,359
I can't take it!
- I'm leaving too

1666
02:06:48,467 --> 02:06:51,368
Let's go and meet the damn producer
I'm waiting. . . for my money's worth

1667
02:07:09,455 --> 02:07:11,423
You don't have to be
so discouraged

1668
02:07:12,391 --> 02:07:14,359
You shouldn't take it
to heart, Chutki

1669
02:07:14,526 --> 02:07:16,460
It's only your first film

1670
02:07:17,262 --> 02:07:21,358
You have a long way to go.
You mustn't think about such things

1671
02:07:22,401 --> 02:07:24,335
You can't be discouraged
like this, can you?

1672
02:07:24,436 --> 02:07:27,371
Look forward to the next film.
Continue to work hard

1673
02:07:27,473 --> 02:07:30,374
What difference does it make. . .?
- Shut up, Raja. . . just shut up!

1674
02:07:31,410 --> 02:07:34,379
Didn't you hear what the audience
had to say? Didn't you. . .?

1675
02:07:37,349 --> 02:07:39,510
There were only a handful of
people who laughed at me earlier

1676
02:07:40,419 --> 02:07:42,512
And now, the whole world
is laughing at me

1677
02:07:46,325 --> 02:07:48,384
I can't take the humiliation, Raja

1678
02:07:50,329 --> 02:07:52,354
It hurts a lot. . . hurts a lot. . .

1679
02:07:56,402 --> 02:07:59,462
I told you. . .
take me back to the village

1680
02:08:01,240 --> 02:08:04,471
The people here are right.
I have nothing in me. . . nothing

1681
02:08:06,278 --> 02:08:10,271
But you went on, ''No, Chutki.
They're wrong, you don't worry. . .''

1682
02:08:10,416 --> 02:08:12,475
''it's because they
don't know you''

1683
02:08:14,386 --> 02:08:16,251
They know me now, don't they?

1684
02:08:16,388 --> 02:08:18,447
You've been mocking me
all along, haven't you?

1685
02:08:20,459 --> 02:08:23,360
Now, even you know me, for what
I'm worth, isn't it?

1686
02:08:24,396 --> 02:08:26,364
Everybody has rejected me anyway

1687
02:08:28,400 --> 02:08:31,460
It's all so clear,
I have nothing

1688
02:08:33,405 --> 02:08:37,273
Even you must be ashamed to be
with me, isn't it? So go away now. . .

1689
02:08:39,411 --> 02:08:41,311
I'm too ashamed

1690
02:08:41,413 --> 02:08:43,472
I will feel ashamed
to be with you. . . ! ?

1691
02:08:45,250 --> 02:08:45,511
I. . . ! ?

1692
02:08:52,391 --> 02:08:56,293
This thing about your film. . .
I really can't figure it out

1693
02:08:59,331 --> 02:09:01,299
But I still believe. . .

1694
02:09:03,402 --> 02:09:06,371
that you are simply the best.
The best

1695
02:09:09,541 --> 02:09:13,500
And you're saying, I'll be ashamed
to be with you. . .?

1696
02:09:21,386 --> 02:09:25,345
I have always treated your goals
as mine, Chutki

1697
02:09:28,393 --> 02:09:34,229
I've always wanted you to be happy. . .
and you ask me to go away. . .?

1698
02:09:42,541 --> 02:09:45,374
I. . . If I actually tell you
how I feel. . .

1699
02:09:50,249 --> 02:09:52,308
I never wanted you to
be a big heroine

1700
02:09:56,388 --> 02:09:59,323
Because then, in this world of
glitter and glamour. . .

1701
02:10:00,392 --> 02:10:02,360
you might never need me. . .

1702
02:10:05,397 --> 02:10:08,457
And if I'm of no use to you. . .
then. . . I what. . .

1703
02:10:22,347 --> 02:10:25,339
Enough. We've had enough, Raja

1704
02:10:32,391 --> 02:10:34,359
Let's go back to the village

1705
02:10:39,398 --> 02:10:41,366
Let's go back

1706
02:11:15,400 --> 02:11:20,428
Bombay. . .
such a lovely city, isn't it?

1707
02:11:24,409 --> 02:11:26,377
All those dreams. . .

1708
02:11:28,413 --> 02:11:30,472
there was so much to achieve

1709
02:13:13,251 --> 02:13:15,310
When did they return?
- Yesterday morning

1710
02:13:15,387 --> 02:13:17,355
Their parents are very angry

1711
02:13:18,256 --> 02:13:19,450
They've been here since yesterday.
- Where's Raja?

1712
02:13:20,225 --> 02:13:21,419
He has gone to reason
with them. . . again.

1713
02:13:21,526 --> 02:13:24,359
Whatever you say, Chutki
has done what she wanted to

1714
02:13:24,529 --> 02:13:26,258
That's true

1715
02:13:26,365 --> 02:13:27,491
Talk about yourself! You still
go gallivanting around. . . !

1716
02:13:28,266 --> 02:13:29,460
As if you do the chores for me!
- Shut up!

1717
02:13:29,534 --> 02:13:31,468
Tell her about Birju eloping with Gauri

1718
02:13:31,536 --> 02:13:34,300
She must've told her on the phone.
- No, I forgot. You tell her

1719
02:13:34,373 --> 02:13:38,275
Birju ran away with Gauri !
They used the backdoor

1720
02:13:38,410 --> 02:13:41,277
Tell her what we saw next.
- Forget it

1721
02:13:41,413 --> 02:13:44,382
When will ''Roshni'' release here?
- I don't know that, but. . .

1722
02:13:44,449 --> 02:13:48,249
Your marriage is fiX ed, isn't it?
- On the 2 1st of next month

1723
02:13:52,391 --> 02:13:55,360
They've all agreed.
Your parents and mine

1724
02:13:55,527 --> 02:13:58,291
They're coming take you home.
My mother even said. . .

1725
02:13:58,397 --> 02:14:00,456
I'll personally come and take
my daughter-in-law home

1726
02:14:01,366 --> 02:14:03,357
Let's get our stuff together.
- Hurry up!

1727
02:14:08,407 --> 02:14:10,272
Listen, mister. . .

1728
02:14:11,410 --> 02:14:13,378
does the Madhuri of Gajrolla
live here?

1729
02:14:14,413 --> 02:14:17,382
Chutki ! Someone's here
to meet you

1730
02:14:24,322 --> 02:14:25,311
What. . .?

1731
02:14:27,426 --> 02:14:31,362
How could you come away like this. . .
without even a word to me?

1732
02:14:32,297 --> 02:14:33,491
You should at least called me once. . .

1733
02:14:34,399 --> 02:14:36,367
I wouldn't have let you
come away at all

1734
02:14:36,501 --> 02:14:40,369
There's so much of work in Bombay.
You want to just drop all that?

1735
02:14:42,441 --> 02:14:44,409
Let's go now.
I've come to take you back

1736
02:14:45,243 --> 02:14:47,268
No, Pyarelal-ji.
I'm not going back there again

1737
02:14:48,280 --> 02:14:50,248
I'm going to live here and
try to be happy

1738
02:14:50,415 --> 02:14:54,374
Pyarelal-ji, I did so much. . .
I've had enough of it

1739
02:14:55,487 --> 02:14:59,446
I'm a married woman, Pyarelal-ji.
I'd like to live here with my family

1740
02:15:01,426 --> 02:15:04,293
But you're not an
ordinary girl, Chutki

1741
02:15:06,465 --> 02:15:13,303
Does marriage alter your talent,
your passion and your dreams?

1742
02:15:14,406 --> 02:15:16,340
Look at this!

1743
02:15:17,409 --> 02:15:19,343
Your work is being talked about

1744
02:15:19,511 --> 02:15:22,344
There's a mention of you
in every magazine

1745
02:15:22,514 --> 02:15:26,280
It didn't do well in the cities,
but it's a super-hit otherwise

1746
02:15:27,419 --> 02:15:30,286
You know how much of money
this film has made?

1747
02:15:30,489 --> 02:15:34,289
Top producers and directors
are calling me. . . for you !

1748
02:15:34,526 --> 02:15:37,290
Things are just starting
to look up and you. . .

1749
02:15:37,395 --> 02:15:39,454
you've given it all up
to live here?

1750
02:15:51,443 --> 02:15:55,379
No, Pyarelal-ji. Whatever it is,
I don't want it

1751
02:15:55,480 --> 02:15:57,414
What happened?
- Chutki. . .

1752
02:16:14,466 --> 02:16:16,434
Before our parents arrive
let's get out of here

1753
02:16:26,244 --> 02:16:28,337
They're kids. . . forget it.
- What mistake. . .?

1754
02:16:28,513 --> 02:16:30,310
Get to the station

1755
02:16:30,415 --> 02:16:32,315
Mom and dad have arrived !

1756
02:16:32,417 --> 02:16:34,317
Get going ! Quick!

1757
02:16:37,455 --> 02:16:41,289
Where have they gone?
- They've gone back to Bombay

1758
02:16:41,393 --> 02:16:42,360
What. . .?
