1
00:01:39,264 --> 00:01:40,262
What are you doing?

2
00:01:40,827 --> 00:01:41,695
You're pregnant!

3
00:01:41,781 --> 00:01:42,693
Don't do all this.

4
00:01:42,823 --> 00:01:44,169
Go set up the kitchen.

5
00:01:44,212 --> 00:01:46,296
It's alright.
-Listen to me… go.

6
00:01:46,789 --> 00:01:48,134
Don't lift anything heavy.

7
00:01:58,190 --> 00:01:59,839
Dude, stay home and take care
of them?

8
00:01:59,864 --> 00:02:00,819
Where are you going?

9
00:02:00,844 --> 00:02:03,665
They said dad stole the file
and fired me.

10
00:02:04,231 --> 00:02:06,709
I need to find a job
before I run out of money.

11
00:02:06,807 --> 00:02:08,413
But you don't have to start today!

12
00:02:08,438 --> 00:02:09,958
I must start looking right away.

13
00:02:10,716 --> 00:02:11,540
Dude.

14
00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:13,324
Just do me one favour.

15
00:02:13,507 --> 00:02:15,677
It's not possible to start
cooking today.

16
00:02:15,939 --> 00:02:18,833
If you could bring some food
for mom and Yamuna…

17
00:02:18,858 --> 00:02:20,445
My mom has already packed food for them.

18
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:21,425
I'll handle it, don't worry.

19
00:02:21,858 --> 00:02:22,639
Thanks, dude.

20
00:02:24,945 --> 00:02:26,462
Your profile is impressive.

21
00:02:26,864 --> 00:02:29,771
Why did you quit your previous job?

22
00:02:40,932 --> 00:02:41,930
Won't you eat?

23
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:43,944
No, mother-in-law.
I'm not hungry.

24
00:02:43,969 --> 00:02:44,992
I'll eat later.

25
00:02:55,343 --> 00:02:57,166
He'll be home soon.
Let's go inside.

26
00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:17,944
Sir, do you know what happened to my dad?
-I have no idea.

27
00:03:18,718 --> 00:03:20,064
Okay. Thank you, sir.
-Okay.

28
00:03:20,168 --> 00:03:22,512
Sir, my dad...
-I have nothing to do with it.

29
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:23,969
I don't know anything.

30
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:25,790
Okay, sir. Thanks.

31
00:03:36,827 --> 00:03:37,869
Are you drunk?

32
00:03:42,787 --> 00:03:44,089
Yes.

33
00:03:44,984 --> 00:03:46,026
Forgive me.

34
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:48,378
Forgive me, mom.

35
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:51,001
I…

36
00:03:51,931 --> 00:03:52,842
Couldn't…

37
00:03:53,624 --> 00:03:54,319
So…

38
00:03:58,892 --> 00:04:00,064
Is this our home?

39
00:04:01,727 --> 00:04:02,943
Is this our life?

40
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:06,236
Is this how we're going to live?

41
00:04:07,707 --> 00:04:10,789
I'm not saying
we were really well-off before…

42
00:04:11,624 --> 00:04:12,752
But it was good.

43
00:04:16,055 --> 00:04:16,836
And now…

44
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:21,124
I'm unable to take
good care of the both of you, mom!

45
00:04:22,905 --> 00:04:25,162
I'm unable to do anything for you!

46
00:04:29,313 --> 00:04:31,051
Please forgive me!

47
00:04:31,076 --> 00:04:32,900
You forgive me, too…

48
00:04:33,393 --> 00:04:34,173
Forgive me!

49
00:04:35,352 --> 00:04:36,046
Mom!

50
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:40,676
Everyone is saying something or the other
about dad.

51
00:04:40,701 --> 00:04:42,219
I asked everyone, mom.

52
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:44,532
No one knows anything.

53
00:04:47,433 --> 00:04:48,127
That's why...

54
00:04:48,532 --> 00:04:49,616
I couldn't take it.

55
00:04:50,554 --> 00:04:51,422
I got drunk.

56
00:04:54,767 --> 00:04:55,505
Yamuna!

57
00:04:56,309 --> 00:04:57,048
Yamuna!

58
00:04:58,081 --> 00:04:59,479
You're my life, Yamuna!
-Okay.

59
00:04:59,504 --> 00:05:00,676
You are.
-Okay.

60
00:05:00,701 --> 00:05:03,652
I'm so lucky to be married to you.

61
00:05:04,022 --> 00:05:05,020
My name is Tamizh.

62
00:05:05,485 --> 00:05:06,874
My dad meant the world to me.

63
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,131
I was very happy when my dad was around.

64
00:05:09,504 --> 00:05:11,328
Dad, I drink beer sometimes.

65
00:05:14,024 --> 00:05:15,370
You drink often?

66
00:05:15,395 --> 00:05:17,122
No. Maybe once or twice a week.

67
00:05:17,813 --> 00:05:19,680
As long as you don't drink often.

68
00:05:19,705 --> 00:05:22,916
The kind of filth you're watching,
you'll go to waste!

69
00:05:22,941 --> 00:05:25,098
How dare you bring this
into the house?

70
00:05:25,123 --> 00:05:25,775
Go now.

71
00:05:25,808 --> 00:05:28,542
Take it back to the wretched place
you got it from.

72
00:05:29,904 --> 00:05:31,120
Sorry, man.
It's my fault.

73
00:05:31,144 --> 00:05:31,926
Forget it.

74
00:05:31,962 --> 00:05:33,326
Like he never watched stuff
growing up.

75
00:05:33,351 --> 00:05:35,954
It's important to watch and learn, dude.
Can't afford to get it wrong!

76
00:05:35,979 --> 00:05:36,865
Hope he didn't hear that.

77
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:38,713
Dude, I heard you get these
in 3-D now.

78
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:40,747
Dude, hurry up.
The show is about to begin.

79
00:05:40,772 --> 00:05:43,295
After my parents, the two
important people in my life…

80
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,708
My cousin Aravindh and my friend Kumaran.

81
00:05:45,733 --> 00:05:47,101
Aravindh!
-Yes, auntie?

82
00:05:47,126 --> 00:05:49,079
I've made pickle.

83
00:05:49,104 --> 00:05:51,488
Carry a jar back home
to your mother.

84
00:05:51,513 --> 00:05:52,555
I'll take it later today!

85
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:54,837
I told you not to triple-ride on the bike.

86
00:06:00,197 --> 00:06:01,629
'What could I possibly say to him?'

87
00:06:02,616 --> 00:06:04,092
'All this while,
I've yelled at him.'

88
00:06:04,117 --> 00:06:05,028
'I've hit him.'

89
00:06:05,424 --> 00:06:07,642
'If I speak to him affectionately
now that he's got a job…'

90
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:09,924
'Won't he think his dad is
only after his money?'

91
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:18,590
'Your letters burned to ash, my dear;
I wasn't even done reading them'

92
00:06:18,616 --> 00:06:20,439
'You're the reason I live…"

93
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:22,428
That Anita is some girl.

94
00:06:22,476 --> 00:06:23,909
I want a girl like her.

95
00:06:24,206 --> 00:06:26,840
You have preferences?
-Sure.

96
00:06:27,402 --> 00:06:28,444
I'm okay with anything.

97
00:06:28,469 --> 00:06:29,945
You're talking about the dirty stuff.

98
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:30,969
I'm talking about love.

99
00:06:30,994 --> 00:06:33,485
A girl would come into my life.
Fix me, transform me.

100
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:34,768
That's a special feeling, dude.

101
00:06:34,793 --> 00:06:36,138
So, you'll let your girl change you?

102
00:06:36,163 --> 00:06:37,199
Shamelessly.

103
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:38,181
I can see that.

104
00:06:38,206 --> 00:06:40,539
You live in a colony, just like that movie.
But no Anitas here.

105
00:06:40,564 --> 00:06:41,984
Only Kathirs.

106
00:06:42,009 --> 00:06:43,905
Turn on the T.V.
Match is about to begin.

107
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:44,928
Mum, I want-

108
00:06:44,953 --> 00:06:46,038
Why are you limping?

109
00:06:46,327 --> 00:06:49,235
Strained my hip while mopping the floor.
-How come, aunty?

110
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:50,692
Get out, you swamp.

111
00:06:50,718 --> 00:06:52,695
You cuss more than us these days.

112
00:06:52,767 --> 00:06:53,678
Tamizh…

113
00:06:53,895 --> 00:06:55,941
It's your dad's star birthday.

114
00:06:55,966 --> 00:06:58,624
Need to give offerings at the temple.
 I don't feel well. Will you go?

115
00:06:58,649 --> 00:07:00,341
What? To the temple?
No chance.

116
00:07:00,366 --> 00:07:01,704
What about my image?
I won't go.

117
00:07:01,729 --> 00:07:03,735
How will going to temple hurt your image?
-Mom!

118
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,888
Stop kidding!

119
00:07:04,913 --> 00:07:06,849
I call such guys "goody-goody".

120
00:07:06,874 --> 00:07:08,220
I only ask because
I don't feel well.

121
00:07:08,245 --> 00:07:09,721
Mom, I need to watch the match.

122
00:07:16,327 --> 00:07:16,935
Fine, I'll go.

123
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:17,914
Don't make that face.

124
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:18,850
Drama queen!

125
00:07:18,925 --> 00:07:20,879
Give me money for snacks,
or I won't go.

126
00:07:22,126 --> 00:07:23,776
One fine day,
this technique will stop working.

127
00:07:23,801 --> 00:07:24,929
Oh, now you can walk?

128
00:07:24,954 --> 00:07:26,560
Okay, I'm off.
-Where are you going?

129
00:07:26,789 --> 00:07:28,265
No way I'm going to the temple.

130
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:29,288
Have fun.
-Wait up, man!

131
00:07:29,313 --> 00:07:31,217
I'm off, too.
-Where are you going?

132
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:32,371
To give him company.

133
00:07:37,246 --> 00:07:38,114
Fine, I'll go with you.

134
00:07:38,139 --> 00:07:39,224
Don't make that face!

135
00:07:39,267 --> 00:07:41,221
One fine day,
this technique will stop working.

136
00:07:41,246 --> 00:07:42,462
We'll see about that!

137
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:47,035
Be careful.
-Do I get snacks, too?

138
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:51,246
What are you praying to God?

139
00:07:52,622 --> 00:07:53,137
Nothing.

140
00:07:53,162 --> 00:07:53,857
Just posing.

141
00:07:54,361 --> 00:07:54,882
You?

142
00:07:54,907 --> 00:07:56,210
Mobile phone. Car. Girls.

143
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:59,757
"Girls just don't get it..."

144
00:07:59,782 --> 00:08:01,345
It's the beast.
-It's "priest"

145
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:02,064
Yeah, a priest.

146
00:08:02,088 --> 00:08:03,649
You've come to make an offering?
-Yes.

147
00:08:03,675 --> 00:08:05,195
In my dad's name.
-His name?

148
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:06,262
Dad's name is Vijayaraghavan.

149
00:08:06,287 --> 00:08:07,633
His birth star?
-Don't know.

150
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:11,915
Man, you don't even know
your dad's birth star?

151
00:08:13,198 --> 00:08:14,283
No, man. You?

152
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:15,278
Heck, no.

153
00:08:17,241 --> 00:08:18,022
Not bad.

154
00:08:18,215 --> 00:08:20,342
Some decent looking girls
come to this temple.

155
00:08:20,821 --> 00:08:21,387
Maybe.

156
00:08:21,783 --> 00:08:23,390
But I've set my heart on one.

157
00:08:23,709 --> 00:08:24,274
Who?

158
00:08:24,663 --> 00:08:25,303
Over there.

159
00:08:25,328 --> 00:08:26,500
She's my heroine.

160
00:08:26,591 --> 00:08:29,066
That's Revathy.
She lives in my colony.

161
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:31,131
I know. Why do you think
I come there so often?

162
00:08:31,156 --> 00:08:32,508
To see your face?
-Crook!

163
00:08:32,533 --> 00:08:34,356
She won't give in.

164
00:08:34,381 --> 00:08:35,667
Doesn't even talk to anyone.

165
00:08:35,692 --> 00:08:36,777
Very arrogant.

166
00:08:37,813 --> 00:08:39,592
Then, I've fixed my mind
on another lover.

167
00:08:39,901 --> 00:08:40,683
Who is that?

168
00:08:41,065 --> 00:08:41,760
Behind her.

169
00:08:45,387 --> 00:08:47,514
So the one I first saw
was the heroine's friend?

170
00:08:51,525 --> 00:08:54,085
I've found my own Anita
like the movie 7-G Rainbow Colony.

171
00:08:54,631 --> 00:08:55,326
Dude…

172
00:08:55,819 --> 00:08:57,454
You know you're just a comedian.

173
00:08:57,866 --> 00:08:58,647
Look over there.

174
00:08:58,672 --> 00:09:01,493
I'll get that girl.
We'll see who has the last laugh.

175
00:09:05,946 --> 00:09:06,467
Dude.

176
00:09:08,217 --> 00:09:09,528
She's unbelievable.

177
00:09:11,062 --> 00:09:13,067
I doubt if she'd be single.

178
00:09:13,283 --> 00:09:15,713
By now, some bloke must have
gone on his knees and wooed her?

179
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:19,717
You're not as good looking as me.
It's your low self-esteem talking.

180
00:09:19,742 --> 00:09:21,695
I find her pretty average.

181
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,411
My heart tells me
that no one's wooed her yet.

182
00:09:25,993 --> 00:09:26,645
Dude!

183
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,123
Your comedy timing…

184
00:09:28,407 --> 00:09:29,753
Just keeps getting better.

185
00:09:29,965 --> 00:09:30,876
They're leaving.

186
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:33,073
Why do you keep calling me a comedian?

187
00:09:36,812 --> 00:09:38,721
The one in green is yours.
Orange, mine.

188
00:09:38,746 --> 00:09:40,352
That was easy, picking them up.

189
00:09:45,407 --> 00:09:46,362
About this...

190
00:09:46,524 --> 00:09:47,627
Aravindh needn't know.

191
00:09:47,652 --> 00:09:48,346
Because he is…

192
00:09:48,371 --> 00:09:50,193
Much better looking than us.

193
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:52,309
That's sad for them…

194
00:09:52,334 --> 00:09:53,940
Where are you going?
-To the temple, mom.

195
00:09:54,171 --> 00:09:54,909
The temple?

196
00:09:55,207 --> 00:09:56,768
He never goes, even if I beg him…

197
00:09:58,789 --> 00:10:00,067
Where to?
-The stationary store.

198
00:10:00,092 --> 00:10:01,437
Why?
-To buy ink.

199
00:10:01,462 --> 00:10:02,635
I'll go with you.
-No thanks.

200
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:04,763
I thought about it all night.

201
00:10:04,883 --> 00:10:05,968
I'm okay with Revathy.

202
00:10:06,177 --> 00:10:07,393
You can have the white girl.

203
00:10:07,605 --> 00:10:08,386
Tell me now.

204
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:09,033
Where are you going?

205
00:10:09,058 --> 00:10:10,404
I'm going to the temple.
Won't you join me?

206
00:10:12,199 --> 00:10:12,807
Dude...

207
00:10:13,086 --> 00:10:16,122
What made you so sure
she'd be at the temple this time today?

208
00:10:16,147 --> 00:10:17,566
Revathy comes to the temple
everyday at this time.

209
00:10:17,591 --> 00:10:18,504
Just a simple math.

210
00:10:17,053 --> 00:10:18,355
The only kind of math you know.

211
00:10:29,367 --> 00:10:34,532
When you look at me - WHAM!;
My mind goes - BAM!

212
00:10:37,757 --> 00:10:42,836
Plant one on my face - SMACK!;
My nerves would tingle - OH SHEESH!

213
00:10:46,178 --> 00:10:50,214
And when you turn around - TOK TOK!
Girl, my system crashes down - PLONK!

214
00:10:50,647 --> 00:10:54,684
Touch me gently like the wind - SWISH!
And I'll feel so chill - BADUM TISH!

215
00:10:54,709 --> 00:10:58,828
If ever you were to fall - THUD THUD!
Babe, I'll be waiting to catch you - TA-DA!

216
00:10:58,853 --> 00:10:59,463
Don't shake your head!

217
00:10:59,561 --> 00:11:00,385
Fine. You shake it.

218
00:11:03,169 --> 00:11:08,246
The way you prance - FLIP FLOP!
My body feels hysteric - WHOOP WHOOP!

219
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:10,072
Where are you going?
-To the temple, dude.

220
00:11:10,097 --> 00:11:12,628
Kumaran! Your jokes get
funnier by the day.

221
00:11:12,653 --> 00:11:15,421
I'd given my bat to Senthil Kumar...

222
00:11:15,603 --> 00:11:16,601
I'll go get it back from him.

223
00:11:16,932 --> 00:11:17,843
Oh yeah?

224
00:11:17,868 --> 00:11:19,717
Mum has sent flour.
I'll give it to auntie and come.

225
00:11:19,742 --> 00:11:21,614
Dude, listen.
This is not a job for three.

226
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:23,028
We'll go get it back.

227
00:11:23,244 --> 00:11:25,544
You stay here and make some pancakes.
-Okay? Bye.

228
00:11:25,569 --> 00:11:26,437
Liar!

229
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:29,111
No way.
"Ditching" is a strong word.

230
00:11:29,136 --> 00:11:30,905
He tells his mom everything.

231
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:32,362
His mom would tell mine.

232
00:11:32,387 --> 00:11:33,516
My mom would tell my dad.

233
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:34,755
And my dad would talk to me.

234
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:35,649
Why bother?

235
00:11:35,674 --> 00:11:37,410
Eat while you eat…

236
00:11:37,817 --> 00:11:40,335
Tamizh, heard you've been
going to the temple everyday?

237
00:11:40,467 --> 00:11:41,595
Your mother told me.

238
00:11:45,486 --> 00:11:46,224
What?

239
00:11:46,659 --> 00:11:47,802
He goes to the temple everyday?

240
00:11:47,827 --> 00:11:49,084
You didn't know?

241
00:11:49,316 --> 00:11:51,020
You know his every move.

242
00:11:51,226 --> 00:11:51,964
Exactly.

243
00:11:51,989 --> 00:11:53,465
I know his every move.

244
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:56,007
Anyway, that's a good thing.

245
00:11:56,269 --> 00:11:57,094
Aravindh…

246
00:11:57,698 --> 00:11:59,044
What are your plans after college?

247
00:11:59,178 --> 00:12:00,871
Business, like dad.

248
00:12:00,896 --> 00:12:03,196
Is he studying for it?

249
00:12:03,312 --> 00:12:04,875
What do I know, brother?

250
00:12:04,955 --> 00:12:06,213
He does what he wants.

251
00:12:06,357 --> 00:12:08,180
Roams around in his scooter
all the time.

252
00:12:08,522 --> 00:12:09,651
Oh no! My scooter.

253
00:12:10,645 --> 00:12:12,945
I took the scooter to work
but took the bus back home.

254
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:13,925
That's bad!

255
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:16,133
What a careless man!
-Why do you do such things, dad?

256
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:18,641
You refuse to see a doctor about it.
Your memory is getting worse.

257
00:12:18,999 --> 00:12:21,784
Can you go to my office
with Aravindh and get my scooter?

258
00:12:21,809 --> 00:12:22,893
No way! I need to study.

259
00:12:22,918 --> 00:12:25,001
It'll only take you half an hour.
Please!

260
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:26,387
Please go, son.

261
00:12:27,035 --> 00:12:28,251
Don't be mad, dude.

262
00:12:28,467 --> 00:12:30,116
Didn't mean to hide anything
from you.

263
00:12:30,367 --> 00:12:31,669
Fine, I'll tell you the truth.

264
00:12:32,505 --> 00:12:34,500
Remember the day mom forced me
to go to the temple?

265
00:12:34,525 --> 00:12:35,436
When I went there…

266
00:12:35,825 --> 00:12:36,693
Something changed.

267
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:37,809
A sense of peace.

268
00:12:37,997 --> 00:12:38,822
Tranquility!

269
00:12:39,058 --> 00:12:40,317
I felt enlightened.

270
00:12:40,343 --> 00:12:41,733
Like a ray of light.

271
00:12:42,599 --> 00:12:44,465
I have been drawn to the temple
everyday since.

272
00:12:44,644 --> 00:12:47,162
You wouldn't go with me,
and you'd make fun!

273
00:12:47,186 --> 00:12:48,618
Dude, stop.
Dad's office if here.

274
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:52,788
You're lying.

275
00:12:53,092 --> 00:12:55,218
You'll come to me when there's a problem.

276
00:12:55,561 --> 00:12:56,343
We'll see then.

277
00:12:58,528 --> 00:13:00,872
But you could've said something believable.
-Shut it.

278
00:13:01,049 --> 00:13:02,307
He won't mind too much.

279
00:13:02,612 --> 00:13:03,393
So…

280
00:13:03,418 --> 00:13:05,240
You should do something
about the girl!

281
00:13:05,379 --> 00:13:06,464
You should talk to her!

282
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:07,864
See...

283
00:13:08,032 --> 00:13:09,867
She's out of my league.

284
00:13:09,892 --> 00:13:11,050
So I'm a little reluctant, dude.

285
00:13:11,075 --> 00:13:15,805
Just talk to her, it's no big deal.
She's just a girl, after all.

286
00:13:15,948 --> 00:13:20,463
Need to get the little things right.
Or we'll goof up the big ones.

287
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:22,508
Didn't see you in the class?

288
00:13:22,533 --> 00:13:23,819
I'd gone to the temple.

289
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:25,537
Whoa! So funny.

290
00:13:25,562 --> 00:13:26,300
No, really.

291
00:13:26,535 --> 00:13:30,033
I wanted some peace, tranquility
and enlightenment.

292
00:13:30,058 --> 00:13:32,390
I won't go to the temple anymore.
Let it go, man.

293
00:13:32,524 --> 00:13:34,033
Why?
You've attained salvation?

294
00:13:34,144 --> 00:13:35,253
Come on!

295
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:36,406
Forget it. Let's go up to the terrace
and drink some beer.

296
00:13:36,431 --> 00:13:37,734
No, I'm going to the movies.

297
00:13:39,086 --> 00:13:39,737
With whom?

298
00:13:39,793 --> 00:13:41,627
Gokul and his friends.

299
00:13:41,652 --> 00:13:44,285
Why would you go
with that loser?

300
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:46,219
I only went to the temple…
-No.

301
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,235
It's not like that.

302
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,692
He called me, and I'm going.

303
00:13:48,717 --> 00:13:49,238
That's all.

304
00:13:49,297 --> 00:13:50,990
I'm off.
Bye, man.

305
00:13:52,964 --> 00:13:54,136
He's avoiding us.

306
00:13:54,161 --> 00:13:56,766
It's alright.
We did ditch him.

307
00:13:56,996 --> 00:13:58,819
You like him way too much.

308
00:13:58,844 --> 00:14:01,058
But he doesn't appear
very affectionate towards you.

309
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:02,255
Trouser face!

310
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:05,175
I'm open about my feelings
and he's not. That's all.

311
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,501
Don't talk like a fool.

312
00:14:06,526 --> 00:14:07,199
Dude!

313
00:14:07,224 --> 00:14:07,876
What?

314
00:14:08,089 --> 00:14:09,746
It's the white girl.

315
00:14:10,305 --> 00:14:11,296
Go on, talk to her.

316
00:14:11,321 --> 00:14:12,146
This is your chance.

317
00:14:12,336 --> 00:14:12,943
No, man.

318
00:14:12,969 --> 00:14:16,172
Need to get the little things right.
Or you'll goof up the big ones.

319
00:14:16,197 --> 00:14:17,442
Just ask for her name.

320
00:14:17,467 --> 00:14:19,593
She'll either say her name,
or refuse.

321
00:14:19,689 --> 00:14:20,989
What's the worse that could happen?

322
00:14:21,014 --> 00:14:21,838
Talk to her.

323
00:14:21,967 --> 00:14:22,835
TALK TO HER!

324
00:14:38,509 --> 00:14:39,030
Hi.

325
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:42,501
We've met at the temple.

326
00:14:44,168 --> 00:14:45,296
What's your name?

327
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:47,675
Name!

328
00:14:48,148 --> 00:14:50,665
Do you know how many guys
follow me everyday?

329
00:14:50,865 --> 00:14:52,818
The number of guys
who try to talk to me?

330
00:14:53,148 --> 00:14:55,189
Or the number of guys
who ask for my number?

331
00:14:55,563 --> 00:14:58,470
If I were to give my number
to everyone, what does that make me?

332
00:14:58,872 --> 00:15:00,607
You just randomly walk up
and ask my name!

333
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:02,967
He's your friend?

334
00:15:04,155 --> 00:15:07,106
Didn't he encourage you
to come talk to me?

335
00:15:08,124 --> 00:15:08,904
Please go.

336
00:15:29,164 --> 00:15:30,032
What did you say?

337
00:15:30,477 --> 00:15:33,645
She'll either say her name,
or refuse.

338
00:15:33,843 --> 00:15:35,150
What's the worse that could happen…

339
00:15:35,287 --> 00:15:36,025
Right?

340
00:15:36,578 --> 00:15:38,840
She said everything but that,
you dumb…

341
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:41,436
Forget it, dude!
She seems arrogant.

342
00:15:41,461 --> 00:15:42,287
Won't work out.

343
00:15:42,312 --> 00:15:44,309
That's why I declined.

344
00:15:45,933 --> 00:15:46,584
Dude…

345
00:15:46,856 --> 00:15:48,331
Your comedy timing…

346
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,612
Keeps getting better!

347
00:15:49,991 --> 00:15:51,207
Look over there!

348
00:15:51,469 --> 00:15:53,075
What's the white girl
doing here?

349
00:15:53,101 --> 00:15:54,837
Must have come to meet Revathy.

350
00:15:54,862 --> 00:15:56,208
He's followed me here.

351
00:15:56,902 --> 00:15:59,810
She talks too much.
I don't want any of this…

352
00:16:00,034 --> 00:16:01,466
These guys just don't get it.

353
00:16:03,011 --> 00:16:04,704
I'm good looking, too.

354
00:16:04,729 --> 00:16:07,854
But I don't brag about all the girls
who follow me, ask for my number.

355
00:16:08,898 --> 00:16:10,113
What happened?

356
00:16:10,525 --> 00:16:11,131
What?

357
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:13,917
You were being serious?
I thought you were joking.

358
00:16:15,303 --> 00:16:17,298
What's wrong with you?
Why do you follow me around?

359
00:16:17,414 --> 00:16:18,542
Are you mad?
-Stop, don't!

360
00:16:18,567 --> 00:16:19,218
Wait!

361
00:16:19,646 --> 00:16:22,424
I told you the other day,
not to follow me.

362
00:16:22,753 --> 00:16:24,447
Aren't you ashamed?
Stalking a girl…

363
00:16:24,472 --> 00:16:26,251
Follow me again
and I'll call the cops.

364
00:16:26,453 --> 00:16:27,712
Don't follow me.

365
00:16:27,737 --> 00:16:29,344
He lives in this colony.

366
00:16:33,688 --> 00:16:34,339
'H' Block.

367
00:16:35,909 --> 00:16:38,817
I've never followed anyone.
I didn't follow you.

368
00:16:38,842 --> 00:16:41,235
But you said "follow"
so many times, now I want to.

369
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:42,476
I'm going to start following you.

370
00:16:43,146 --> 00:16:44,404
I saw you at the temple…

371
00:16:44,686 --> 00:16:45,597
Asked for your name.

372
00:16:45,623 --> 00:16:47,316
Is there a more decent way
to approach someone?

373
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:50,075
And you went on about
so many people following you...

374
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,646
Your name, your hometown.

375
00:16:51,671 --> 00:16:53,979
How Jackie Chan asked you out
in Japan, and Michael Jackson in America…

376
00:16:54,057 --> 00:16:55,012
So arrogant!

377
00:16:57,112 --> 00:16:59,978
But such a pretty girl
can afford to be that arrogant.

378
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:00,903
It's not wrong.

379
00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:02,094
Let's go, man.

380
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:06,848
Young lady you've got the glow - BLING BLING!
 I'm just a nervous young man - BOO HOO!

381
00:17:06,873 --> 00:17:11,237
My pulse is rising - OH THROB THROB!
My heart is racing - LUB DUB DUB!

382
00:17:11,262 --> 00:17:12,261
Hey, what's your name?

383
00:17:12,286 --> 00:17:12,806
Why?

384
00:17:13,092 --> 00:17:15,002
Don't want to call you "Hey" every time.

385
00:17:15,027 --> 00:17:15,591
Hema.

386
00:17:15,825 --> 00:17:16,736
Hema D'Souza.

387
00:17:16,761 --> 00:17:18,063
Hema The Saucy?

388
00:17:18,726 --> 00:17:19,638
D'Souza!

389
00:17:19,663 --> 00:17:20,356
Why?

390
00:17:20,719 --> 00:17:21,196
What?

391
00:17:21,395 --> 00:17:23,088
Why'd your parents
do this to you?

392
00:17:23,232 --> 00:17:24,100
What's your name?

393
00:17:24,287 --> 00:17:24,852
Tamizh.

394
00:17:24,992 --> 00:17:26,512
Is your dad's name English?

395
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:30,388
That was awful.

396
00:17:30,578 --> 00:17:32,358
Dude, please.
She's my girl!

397
00:17:32,396 --> 00:17:34,219
Please laugh, for my sake?

398
00:17:34,709 --> 00:17:36,359
Fine. Ready?
-Yes.

399
00:17:38,704 --> 00:17:40,787
Wow, awesome.
-So funny.

400
00:17:41,097 --> 00:17:46,305
When you look at me - WHAM!;
My mind goes - BAM!

401
00:17:49,212 --> 00:17:54,464
Plant one on my face - SMACK!;
My nerves would tingle - OH SHEESH!

402
00:17:57,627 --> 00:17:59,321
Is she looking at me?
Is she?

403
00:18:00,144 --> 00:18:01,099
Is he looking at me?

404
00:18:02,344 --> 00:18:04,124
Revathy is checking me out!

405
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:05,815
He's asked his friend to look.

406
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,391
Shall I call the cops?

407
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:12,816
Want the number?
-What?

408
00:18:13,076 --> 00:18:15,116
The cops' number. Thought
I'd give you mine? Boo.

409
00:18:24,919 --> 00:18:26,480
What's wrong with you?
-Nothing.

410
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:35,193
You could have rode
with him, instead.

411
00:18:35,218 --> 00:18:36,390
Okay.
-Let's go.

412
00:18:38,476 --> 00:18:39,083
Hey, stop.

413
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:43,563
You can't enter with slippers.
-We'll take them off, then.

414
00:18:43,682 --> 00:18:45,865
Keep an eye on it.Only shoes are alloed

415
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:52,045
You can't bribe me!

416
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:54,862
He must maintain clean accounts.
Tell him to meet his auditor.

417
00:18:54,887 --> 00:18:57,303
He won't need to pay off officers then.

418
00:18:57,328 --> 00:18:58,119
Boy!

419
00:18:58,404 --> 00:19:00,779
You're just walking in and out...
Where are you going?

420
00:19:00,804 --> 00:19:02,392
Do I ask you where you go?
-No.

421
00:19:02,417 --> 00:19:03,334
Do I?
-No.

422
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:04,317
Why do you ask me then?

423
00:19:04,342 --> 00:19:06,092
Let's go.
-That was great logic.

424
00:19:06,433 --> 00:19:08,724
Hello...
Don't ask me anymore.

425
00:19:08,749 --> 00:19:11,082
You're not afraid to
talk back to your dad?

426
00:19:11,107 --> 00:19:13,429
At his age, he may have
a million reasons to go out.

427
00:19:13,454 --> 00:19:15,495
At our age, so do we.

428
00:19:15,591 --> 00:19:16,924
As long as we do nothing wrong…

429
00:19:16,949 --> 00:19:19,657
They shouldn't interfere in our lives,
nor we in theirs.

430
00:19:20,198 --> 00:19:21,562
My dad won't mistake me.

431
00:19:21,587 --> 00:19:22,878
You have a great dad, man.

432
00:19:22,986 --> 00:19:24,319
But he has terrible memory.

433
00:19:24,425 --> 00:19:26,924
The other day,
he kept calling me "Mustapha".

434
00:19:27,472 --> 00:19:28,597
I just let it be.

435
00:19:29,143 --> 00:19:29,997
What can I do?

436
00:19:30,022 --> 00:19:32,730
Asked him to see a doctor
so many times. He won't listen.

437
00:19:32,755 --> 00:19:35,422
And he works for the government
in the Income Tax department!

438
00:19:35,447 --> 00:19:36,156
Damn…

439
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,363
Where are they?

440
00:19:39,388 --> 00:19:40,388
Who cares where they are?

441
00:19:40,395 --> 00:19:41,603
Buy me a beer.

442
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,094
I'm getting bored here.

443
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:45,119
Dude. I've got 600 bucks!

444
00:19:45,203 --> 00:19:46,370
6 beers each.

445
00:19:46,395 --> 00:19:48,353
We'll rule the night!
-Wow.

446
00:19:51,981 --> 00:19:53,939
Just to be safe, lets see the menu.
-Correct.

447
00:19:54,133 --> 00:19:55,466
Menu card, please.

448
00:19:55,578 --> 00:19:57,162
How do we spend all this money?

449
00:19:58,211 --> 00:19:59,211
Bloody fool.

450
00:20:02,206 --> 00:20:04,289
Everything costs 500 or 1000 bucks.

451
00:20:04,498 --> 00:20:06,039
This is priced at 20 bucks!

452
00:20:06,239 --> 00:20:07,489
That's the water bottle.

453
00:20:08,461 --> 00:20:09,211
Look here!

454
00:20:09,236 --> 00:20:10,278
Beer for 200 bucks.

455
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:12,735
Give us two of these 200 bucks beer.
-Two!

456
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,371
You said we'll have 6 beers.
But this is a tiny bottle!

457
00:20:16,396 --> 00:20:17,982
This won't get us drunk!
-Dude.

458
00:20:18,146 --> 00:20:18,981
Just drink that.

459
00:20:19,006 --> 00:20:21,507
Didn't come here for beers.
I'm so anxious to find her…

460
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:43,535
She's looking. Or is she looking?
I can never tell.

461
00:20:44,911 --> 00:20:46,661
How do they manage to do that?

462
00:20:54,393 --> 00:20:55,851
Who's this skyscraper?

463
00:20:57,376 --> 00:20:59,042
What's your problem?
-Buzz off, hot shot.

464
00:20:59,241 --> 00:21:00,194
Hello!

465
00:21:00,219 --> 00:21:00,844
Look here.

466
00:21:01,043 --> 00:21:02,251
Why are you staring at my friend?

467
00:21:02,276 --> 00:21:03,401
Laying a hand at HIM?

468
00:21:03,426 --> 00:21:05,551
I go to the gym, too!
-Let go.

469
00:21:09,876 --> 00:21:11,695
I'm the Inspector General's son.
Out of my sight!

470
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,345
I'm the Inspector General's son.

471
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:15,691
Even constable's son could make him
wet his pants...

472
00:21:15,716 --> 00:21:17,340
Who let you in?
-Hey, I know him.

473
00:21:17,388 --> 00:21:19,471
So you're the I.G's son?
-What's wrong with you? We're friends!

474
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:20,737
Your friends are cheap.

475
00:21:20,903 --> 00:21:23,404
Who's cheap?
We paid 200 bucks for a beer.

476
00:21:23,429 --> 00:21:24,887
Beer is cheaper in the stores.

477
00:21:25,766 --> 00:21:27,225
You won't take your eyes off me.

478
00:21:28,465 --> 00:21:29,714
Why do you follow me around?

479
00:21:29,861 --> 00:21:32,028
How could I not follow
such a pretty girl?

480
00:21:32,493 --> 00:21:35,595
Would you ogle at any pretty girl this way?
-Of course.

481
00:21:35,634 --> 00:21:36,259
Yes!

482
00:21:39,198 --> 00:21:41,239
But you’re not just any pretty girl.

483
00:21:45,818 --> 00:21:46,734
Give me my beer.

484
00:21:47,033 --> 00:21:49,325
So you had this little speech
rehearsed, huh?

485
00:21:49,579 --> 00:21:50,537
Give me my beer.

486
00:21:50,778 --> 00:21:51,612
Listen, man.

487
00:21:51,637 --> 00:21:54,012
That rich kid bumped against my beer.

488
00:21:54,188 --> 00:21:55,272
Can I drink yours?

489
00:21:56,193 --> 00:21:56,817
Dude?

490
00:21:57,638 --> 00:21:59,389
Mine spilled.
Can I have yours?

491
00:21:59,414 --> 00:22:00,871
Dude. My brother!
-Shut up.

492
00:22:00,896 --> 00:22:01,929
Stop doing that.

493
00:22:01,954 --> 00:22:02,871
Here! Take it.
Get lost.

494
00:22:02,896 --> 00:22:03,605
Thanks.

495
00:22:08,845 --> 00:22:09,678
Where are they?

496
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,795
Can't see them.

497
00:22:11,504 --> 00:22:12,629
Let's go.
-My beer!

498
00:22:15,954 --> 00:22:18,204
Sir, please…
-Drunk and driving!

499
00:22:18,229 --> 00:22:19,020
Wait here.

500
00:22:19,394 --> 00:22:21,144
Show me your papers.
-I left it behind at home...

501
00:22:21,471 --> 00:22:23,013
Roaming around drunk
with girls at night…

502
00:22:23,038 --> 00:22:23,923
I'm taking you to the station.

503
00:22:23,948 --> 00:22:26,823
Dude, that's my dad's friend!
Uncle Ramalingam.

504
00:22:27,419 --> 00:22:28,711
Just watch me.

505
00:22:28,872 --> 00:22:31,663
I was on my way back home.
-Put your phone inside.

506
00:22:31,688 --> 00:22:33,563
Seize that car.
-Uncle!

507
00:22:33,588 --> 00:22:34,504
Hello, uncle.

508
00:22:34,529 --> 00:22:35,320
Hello, Tamizh!

509
00:22:35,345 --> 00:22:37,553
Uncle… you see, I had a beer.

510
00:22:37,578 --> 00:22:39,328
No problem. Go, I'll handle it.
-No problem.

511
00:22:39,675 --> 00:22:40,675
What else?

512
00:22:40,807 --> 00:22:41,967
They're my friends.

513
00:22:41,992 --> 00:22:43,367
Really? I'll let them go?

514
00:22:44,183 --> 00:22:45,724
Hold the boys.

515
00:22:46,019 --> 00:22:47,353
I'll drop the girl home.

516
00:22:48,493 --> 00:22:49,368
Thanks!
-You, come here.

517
00:22:49,945 --> 00:22:50,529
Come here.

518
00:22:50,999 --> 00:22:53,373
Where's your license?
-I told you I forgot.

519
00:22:54,034 --> 00:22:56,659
Your vehicle insurance is due…

520
00:22:56,819 --> 00:22:59,016
Give me the girls' parents' numbers.
-Please don't do that, sir.

521
00:22:59,041 --> 00:23:02,041
The Assistant Commissioner will be here.
-Sorry, please let us go.

522
00:23:03,145 --> 00:23:04,061
Shall I drop you?

523
00:23:07,002 --> 00:23:07,625
Trust me.

524
00:23:07,649 --> 00:23:09,983
I'm a good guy.
I never break anyone's trust.

525
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:11,516
And your friend?

526
00:23:11,604 --> 00:23:12,563
He'll walk home.

527
00:23:13,362 --> 00:23:15,612
Don't I have any dialogues
in this scene?

528
00:23:15,896 --> 00:23:17,104
I trusted you, too.

529
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:19,978
HEMA: Bye, Revathy.
TAMIZH: Go away, this is my one chance.

530
00:23:20,003 --> 00:23:21,605
REVATHY: What?
TAMIZH: Go hook up with Revathy.

531
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:23,322
KUMARAN: Good idea!
Wish you'd told me sooner.

532
00:23:23,728 --> 00:23:24,561
Hi!

533
00:23:24,955 --> 00:23:26,247
I'll drop you, Revathy.

534
00:23:26,272 --> 00:23:27,606
In your imaginary car?
-Oh no!

535
00:23:27,631 --> 00:23:28,923
He didn't mention that.

536
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:39,791
You don't drink?

537
00:23:40,343 --> 00:23:42,093
I saw you at the bar,
you only drank juice.

538
00:23:42,118 --> 00:23:42,661
No.

539
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:43,756
Why?

540
00:23:44,485 --> 00:23:45,360
Not interested.

541
00:23:45,547 --> 00:23:46,422
Do you drink?

542
00:23:46,816 --> 00:23:47,525
No way!

543
00:23:47,959 --> 00:23:48,959
Do you drink beer?

544
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:51,684
A little.

545
00:23:53,313 --> 00:23:54,188
What do you do?

546
00:23:54,275 --> 00:23:56,025
I did nothing!
Did I brush against you?

547
00:23:56,050 --> 00:23:58,008
I mean, what do you do,
for a living?

548
00:23:58,556 --> 00:24:01,173
I'm a second year
Bachelor of Commerce from the arts college.

549
00:24:01,198 --> 00:24:01,782
You?

550
00:24:02,139 --> 00:24:03,596
Bachelor of technology.
In architecture.

551
00:24:06,856 --> 00:24:09,076
You look like a White girl.
But you come to the temple everyday!

552
00:24:09,101 --> 00:24:10,809
My dad is British.
Mom is a Brahmin.

553
00:24:10,995 --> 00:24:14,219
Mom would insist that I go to the temple
to preserve the culture.

554
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:15,452
I grew fond of temples.

555
00:24:15,477 --> 00:24:18,477
Do I still have to wait
outside the temple to talk to you?

556
00:24:23,193 --> 00:24:23,943
Okay, bye.

557
00:24:24,515 --> 00:24:25,974
Won't even thank me?

558
00:24:27,573 --> 00:24:29,822
She didn't even thank you?

559
00:24:30,134 --> 00:24:31,926
Don't piss me off first thing
in the morning.

560
00:24:32,358 --> 00:24:34,442
Girls are like pancakes.

561
00:24:34,561 --> 00:24:36,019
Boys are the pan.

562
00:24:36,144 --> 00:24:37,894
Everyone enjoys the taste
of the pancakes…

563
00:24:37,936 --> 00:24:39,353
Not the sacrifice made by the pan.

564
00:24:39,395 --> 00:24:40,811
What's with the one liner?

565
00:24:40,836 --> 00:24:44,212
I thought it up a long time back.
Waiting for the right time to say it.

566
00:24:44,237 --> 00:24:45,987
The timing sucked.
-Tamizh!

567
00:24:46,557 --> 00:24:47,182
Come here.

568
00:24:48,067 --> 00:24:49,067
You come here.

569
00:24:49,377 --> 00:24:50,335
You're so macho!

570
00:24:53,461 --> 00:24:54,920
Hema…
-Hema?

571
00:24:55,811 --> 00:24:58,436
Hema asked if you can buy her beer.

572
00:24:58,767 --> 00:24:59,476
Beer?

573
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:01,885
Yesterday, she told me
she doesn't drink.

574
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:03,951
She's been wanting to try it
ever since you told her.

575
00:25:03,976 --> 00:25:04,893
Right…

576
00:25:05,079 --> 00:25:07,120
You take those rich boys
to go clubbing.

577
00:25:07,145 --> 00:25:09,145
But you need me to buy the beer?
-Fine, don't buy.

578
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:09,962
No, let me buy it.

579
00:25:09,987 --> 00:25:10,820
Hey, let me buy it.

580
00:25:10,845 --> 00:25:12,428
But you were so macho!
-Please, let me buy it.

581
00:25:16,404 --> 00:25:18,070
No wonder beer is overpriced.

582
00:25:18,791 --> 00:25:20,415
She's chugging it faster than us!

583
00:25:22,539 --> 00:25:23,955
It's so bitter.

584
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:25,147
Oh no!

585
00:25:25,172 --> 00:25:26,963
You're wasting precious potion, you cow!

586
00:25:44,169 --> 00:25:45,960
She reminds me of "Venneeraadai" Murthy.

587
00:25:50,398 --> 00:25:51,482
I'm steady!

588
00:25:51,818 --> 00:25:53,319
Steady…
-I can see that.

589
00:25:55,101 --> 00:25:56,268
What?

590
00:25:56,855 --> 00:25:58,230
Is she talking about us?

591
00:26:00,886 --> 00:26:02,802
She didn't even finish the joke.

592
00:26:02,827 --> 00:26:04,410
Are you okay, Hema?

593
00:26:05,643 --> 00:26:09,226
Do I look like I'm not okay?

594
00:26:10,008 --> 00:26:10,717
Not at all.

595
00:26:10,864 --> 00:26:12,114
Shut up, you sidekick.

596
00:26:12,139 --> 00:26:14,098
It's not like you're the heroine.
You're the sidekick, too!

597
00:26:14,649 --> 00:26:16,191
Mommy!
-Hit the sidekick, too.

598
00:26:16,388 --> 00:26:17,680
Why did you hit me?

599
00:26:18,739 --> 00:26:19,531
Shut up, man.

600
00:26:19,606 --> 00:26:20,315
Shut up.

601
00:26:20,556 --> 00:26:22,974
Shut it.
-And you thought she's a white girl!

602
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:24,242
Look here, man.

603
00:26:24,668 --> 00:26:25,460
Look here.

604
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:31,225
You look average.
Very average.

605
00:26:34,295 --> 00:26:35,420
But…

606
00:26:36,922 --> 00:26:38,173
You've done something
to me.

607
00:26:38,529 --> 00:26:39,362
You have.

608
00:26:40,476 --> 00:26:41,184
Over here.

609
00:26:42,468 --> 00:26:43,009
And here.

610
00:26:43,034 --> 00:26:44,159
What did you do there?

611
00:26:48,681 --> 00:26:49,969
Do you know what you're doing?

612
00:26:49,994 --> 00:26:51,161
You're doing something!

613
00:26:53,086 --> 00:26:54,169
What have I done, Hema?

614
00:26:55,138 --> 00:26:57,055
You're disturbing me, you pig.

615
00:26:58,043 --> 00:26:59,335
Do you know how I feel?

616
00:27:00,247 --> 00:27:01,871
Come on, let's go.
-I feel…

617
00:27:01,896 --> 00:27:03,604
Let's hit them tomorrow.
-Take her away.

618
00:27:03,743 --> 00:27:04,494
How?

619
00:27:04,567 --> 00:27:06,150
Can't you see that?

620
00:27:06,477 --> 00:27:07,353
You pig…

621
00:27:07,498 --> 00:27:08,249
You dog!

622
00:27:08,567 --> 00:27:09,276
You tramp!

623
00:27:09,301 --> 00:27:10,967
That's too much drama
for half a pint.

624
00:27:11,553 --> 00:27:12,262
Dude.

625
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,739
It's fine that she slapped me.

626
00:27:16,365 --> 00:27:20,183
But between the slaps and curses,
she said something. Yeah?

627
00:27:20,208 --> 00:27:21,208
Yes!

628
00:27:21,397 --> 00:27:23,856
Even though she was tipsy,
she knew you're average looking.

629
00:27:23,881 --> 00:27:26,605
Listen, man.
You're the hunky one, happy?

630
00:27:26,657 --> 00:27:27,186
Thanks!

631
00:27:27,211 --> 00:27:28,003
Idiot!

632
00:27:29,706 --> 00:27:30,956
"You've done something…"

633
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:32,728
"You're doing something.."

634
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:34,225
"You're disturbing me…"

635
00:27:34,857 --> 00:27:36,857
What does all that tell you?

636
00:27:36,947 --> 00:27:38,446
That you're disturbing her.

637
00:27:38,735 --> 00:27:39,610
You won't get it.

638
00:27:50,828 --> 00:27:52,993
Acts like an infant…

639
00:27:59,234 --> 00:28:00,358
Dude.
-Tell me.

640
00:28:01,162 --> 00:28:04,162
When the heroine's friend is not with her,
you must know to walk away.

641
00:28:04,748 --> 00:28:06,331
Go away, dude.
-I'm not going.

642
00:28:06,999 --> 00:28:09,624
Too much nuisance here.
Let's go over there?

643
00:28:09,786 --> 00:28:11,536
Like you'll do any talking there.

644
00:28:14,309 --> 00:28:16,059
Sorry I hit you yesterday.

645
00:28:16,084 --> 00:28:17,417
You hit me?
No, you didn't!

646
00:28:21,117 --> 00:28:24,076
But you mentioned something.

647
00:28:24,929 --> 00:28:26,387
About some disturbance.

648
00:28:26,601 --> 00:28:27,594
Over here.

649
00:28:27,619 --> 00:28:29,443
About how you feel.

650
00:28:29,468 --> 00:28:30,260
Did I?

651
00:28:31,145 --> 00:28:31,854
No, I didn't.

652
00:28:35,979 --> 00:28:38,021
I was kidding.
You did hit me.

653
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:40,412
I'm not kidding.
I didn't say anything.

654
00:28:43,596 --> 00:28:45,513
So whatever you said yesterday
doesn't count?

655
00:28:47,365 --> 00:28:48,406
You could just accept.

656
00:28:49,181 --> 00:28:50,097
Accept what?

657
00:28:51,052 --> 00:28:52,010
That you said it.

658
00:28:52,932 --> 00:28:53,848
Said what?

659
00:29:00,704 --> 00:29:02,079
I used to play
when I was a kid.

660
00:29:05,432 --> 00:29:06,515
I want to play, too.

661
00:30:25,941 --> 00:30:31,024
My love, my life;
Sweet love of my life.

662
00:30:31,803 --> 00:30:37,010
The apple of my eye;
You are, you are, you are.

663
00:30:37,127 --> 00:30:42,001
My love! My life!
Sweetheart, the apple of my eye.

664
00:30:42,026 --> 00:30:47,026
We're punch drunk in love, baby;
Don't you say a word.

665
00:30:47,051 --> 00:30:51,968
We may get tipsy;
But don't you falter.

666
00:30:52,745 --> 00:30:58,120
We're punch drunk in love, baby;
Don't you say a word.

667
00:30:58,145 --> 00:31:03,103
We may get tipsy;
But don't you falter.

668
00:31:04,239 --> 00:31:09,447
Woman! Can't you see?
I'm soaring in new skies.

669
00:31:09,624 --> 00:31:14,707
Oh no, I can't rest now.
My eyes refuse to sleep.

670
00:31:14,883 --> 00:31:19,883
Listen up, you're the one;
My sweet, young love!

671
00:31:20,082 --> 00:31:24,499
Lock your lips to mine;
Devour my soul!

672
00:31:58,087 --> 00:32:03,419
Talking to you, endlessly;
The sound of you breathing softly.

673
00:32:03,546 --> 00:32:08,838
And your kisses on my cheek;
Makes my knees go weak.

674
00:32:08,863 --> 00:32:14,239
Your unfaltering gaze;
I'm lying in a daze.

675
00:32:14,348 --> 00:32:19,847
And the mock anger;
Your naughty fingers.

676
00:32:19,872 --> 00:32:25,165
I see our future;
It's you and me!

677
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:30,148
We'll be together;
We'll be one!

678
00:32:30,496 --> 00:32:35,899
You're everything I wished for;
And everything more!

679
00:32:35,924 --> 00:32:41,175
Girl, I want you by my side;
Even when we're past our prime.

680
00:32:41,396 --> 00:32:51,772
You're the one I'll write love songs for;
When the sun goes down, we'll be one.

681
00:32:52,349 --> 00:32:57,682
Woman! Can't you see?
I'm soaring in new skies.

682
00:32:58,139 --> 00:33:03,556
Oh no, I can't rest now.
My eyes refuse to sleep.

683
00:33:03,581 --> 00:33:08,416
Listen up, you're the one;
My sweet, young love!

684
00:33:08,527 --> 00:33:12,735
Lock your lips to mine;
Devour my soul!

685
00:33:16,039 --> 00:33:16,747
What's this?

686
00:33:16,772 --> 00:33:18,104
We're going to Darjeeling.

687
00:33:18,719 --> 00:33:20,346
What will you tell your parents?

688
00:33:20,371 --> 00:33:22,496
Happy first anniversary.

689
00:33:24,697 --> 00:33:29,822
My love, my life;
Sweet love of my life.

690
00:33:30,012 --> 00:33:35,054
The apple of my eye;
You are, you are, you are.

691
00:33:35,172 --> 00:33:40,090
My love! My life!
Sweetheart, the apple of my eye.

692
00:33:40,226 --> 00:33:45,768
We're punch drunk in love, baby;
Don't you say a word.

693
00:33:45,835 --> 00:33:50,960
We may get tipsy;
But don't you falter.

694
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:56,736
We're punch drunk in love, baby;
Don't you say a word.

695
00:33:56,761 --> 00:34:01,720
We may get tipsy;
But don't you falter.

696
00:34:04,271 --> 00:34:05,396
What's on your mind?

697
00:34:06,021 --> 00:34:06,730
It's just…

698
00:34:07,355 --> 00:34:09,854
I never hide anything from dad
or Aravindh.

699
00:34:10,228 --> 00:34:14,270
Ever since Hema came into my life,
it's like Aravindh is not a part of it.

700
00:34:14,295 --> 00:34:16,003
Must have been close to a year
since we met him?

701
00:34:16,028 --> 00:34:17,736
He's keeping his distance from us, too.

702
00:34:17,832 --> 00:34:20,791
He gets that we're leaving
him out of something.

703
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:23,003
After we get back home...

704
00:34:23,028 --> 00:34:26,944
I'll tell Aravindh and dad about Hema,
and introduce them.

705
00:34:26,969 --> 00:34:30,134
I'm going to find a good job
within a year and marry Hema.

706
00:34:30,223 --> 00:34:32,390
After that, it'll just be my mom,
my dad, Hema…

707
00:34:32,415 --> 00:34:33,457
You, Aravindh...

708
00:34:33,482 --> 00:34:34,273
And my aunt.

709
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:35,738
Won't it be great?

710
00:34:42,356 --> 00:34:44,356
Surprised to see me here?

711
00:34:45,389 --> 00:34:47,917
You've come for your "college tour".
I go to the same college.

712
00:34:47,942 --> 00:34:49,441
Naturally, I'd come for it, too.

713
00:34:49,466 --> 00:34:50,800
Dude, I didn't mean to-

714
00:34:51,592 --> 00:34:53,342
Don't come any closer.

715
00:34:53,588 --> 00:34:54,838
You're being a jerk.

716
00:34:55,297 --> 00:34:56,047
Dude.

717
00:34:56,072 --> 00:34:57,906
Know why I'm not pissed off with you?

718
00:34:58,450 --> 00:34:59,242
You're a nobody.

719
00:34:59,969 --> 00:35:00,844
Don't be mean.

720
00:35:01,118 --> 00:35:02,618
Don't just say things
to hurt him.

721
00:35:02,643 --> 00:35:04,019
I'm being serious, man.

722
00:35:04,044 --> 00:35:06,044
Look, I'm in love with a girl…
-Stop.

723
00:35:06,493 --> 00:35:07,243
Quit it.

724
00:35:07,893 --> 00:35:09,018
Just quit it.

725
00:35:09,894 --> 00:35:11,560
He means more to you
than I do.

726
00:35:12,127 --> 00:35:13,878
Or you'd have told me, too.

727
00:35:14,519 --> 00:35:18,102
How would you feel
if I'd ditched you and gone around with him?

728
00:35:19,984 --> 00:35:23,026
I thought the two of you were my world.
That was my mistake.

729
00:35:23,974 --> 00:35:27,141
I'll find a new world now.
Don't you even feel guilty?

730
00:35:27,713 --> 00:35:28,964
Just stand there.

731
00:35:30,124 --> 00:35:31,041
Just hold that!

732
00:35:31,483 --> 00:35:35,775
I came all the way just to see
that head of yours slouched.

733
00:35:39,913 --> 00:35:41,830
Don't bother coming home
when you're back in town.

734
00:35:42,199 --> 00:35:43,907
I don't ever want to look at your face again.

735
00:35:50,123 --> 00:35:53,206
HEMA: We did our best. Do you like it?
REVATHY: You look so dazed!

736
00:35:53,231 --> 00:35:55,314
HEMA: Cut the cake!
KUMARAN: He's very upset, be quiet.

737
00:35:56,661 --> 00:35:58,077
Let's give them privacy!

738
00:36:02,985 --> 00:36:03,694
Come here.

739
00:36:04,663 --> 00:36:05,788
I've got something for you.

740
00:36:07,896 --> 00:36:08,937
What's wrong?

741
00:36:10,176 --> 00:36:10,926
It's nothing.

742
00:36:11,435 --> 00:36:12,477
Okay, open my gift.

743
00:36:26,779 --> 00:36:27,529
What's this?

744
00:36:28,404 --> 00:36:29,987
This is the house we shall live in.

745
00:36:30,084 --> 00:36:32,792
This is the living room,
where we'd hang out with all our friends.

746
00:36:32,926 --> 00:36:35,855
This is the kitchen,
where you'd hold me from behind.

747
00:36:36,133 --> 00:36:37,882
And this…

748
00:36:38,953 --> 00:36:41,370
This is our master bedroom.

749
00:36:41,713 --> 00:36:43,005
Where… you know..

750
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:46,840
Do you know?

751
00:36:46,865 --> 00:36:47,698
Or…

752
00:36:48,143 --> 00:36:48,852
I do know.

753
00:36:49,113 --> 00:36:49,780
Go on.

754
00:36:50,177 --> 00:36:51,218
This is the balcony.

755
00:36:52,151 --> 00:36:53,026
This is the garden.

756
00:36:54,236 --> 00:36:54,944
Do you like it?

757
00:36:57,412 --> 00:36:58,828
Which is my parents' room?

758
00:37:00,345 --> 00:37:01,345
Your parents?

759
00:37:01,544 --> 00:37:03,794
They'll live in the house they live in now.
-Stop kidding.

760
00:37:03,899 --> 00:37:06,440
How could this be our home
if my parents don't live here?

761
00:37:06,465 --> 00:37:07,632
Where's my parents' room?

762
00:37:08,005 --> 00:37:11,672
Tamizh, I've been drawing this plan
ever since I was a little girl.

763
00:37:12,249 --> 00:37:14,999
It's my dream to live like this
with my husband.

764
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:16,983
Okay, let that dream be.

765
00:37:17,339 --> 00:37:19,880
Now, in that dream of yours,
I'm just going to…

766
00:37:20,381 --> 00:37:21,381
Draw a small line…

767
00:37:21,406 --> 00:37:23,281
Here, it's my parents' room.
It's all good.

768
00:37:23,933 --> 00:37:25,933
Tamizh, we shall live in this house.

769
00:37:26,044 --> 00:37:28,127
And your parents in their current house.

770
00:37:28,881 --> 00:37:30,797
We'll spend time with them every weekend.

771
00:37:30,822 --> 00:37:34,279
Are my parents a cinema hall
to visit on weekends?

772
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:35,919
Why are you fighting with me?

773
00:37:35,944 --> 00:37:36,611
What, then?

774
00:37:36,636 --> 00:37:39,093
My dad is 56.
My mom is 52.

775
00:37:39,118 --> 00:37:41,118
They didn't abandon me when I was a kid.

776
00:37:41,143 --> 00:37:42,852
How could I abandon them now?

777
00:37:42,877 --> 00:37:44,836
I'm not asking you to abandon them.

778
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:46,435
I'll take good care of them.

779
00:37:47,308 --> 00:37:49,434
I'll obey them.
Respect them.

780
00:37:50,850 --> 00:37:54,100
But it's my dream to live this way
with my future husband!

781
00:37:54,125 --> 00:37:56,250
What made you think
I'd leave my parents for you?

782
00:37:56,275 --> 00:37:57,901
I'm leaving mine.
Why can't you?

783
00:37:58,149 --> 00:37:58,733
Don't!

784
00:37:58,758 --> 00:37:59,842
You bring your parents, too.

785
00:37:59,867 --> 00:38:01,993
Let's all live in the same house.
-Are you mocking me?

786
00:38:02,291 --> 00:38:03,583
Trying to be smart, are you?

787
00:38:04,243 --> 00:38:06,118
It just won't work.
-Ditto!

788
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:07,509
It just won't work.

789
00:38:08,419 --> 00:38:10,752
How could you be so selfish?

790
00:38:10,945 --> 00:38:11,613
Selfish?

791
00:38:11,766 --> 00:38:12,682
I'm selfish?

792
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:14,832
Why are you making me
out to be the bad guy here?

793
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,826
I just told you how I wanted to live.

794
00:38:17,055 --> 00:38:18,680
But it's always all about you.

795
00:38:18,951 --> 00:38:19,826
What about me?

796
00:38:19,936 --> 00:38:21,019
What about my dreams?

797
00:38:21,656 --> 00:38:23,864
What's all this life and dream
you speak of?

798
00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:27,387
I don't think this is working out.

799
00:38:27,912 --> 00:38:29,621
You're making a big deal
of a small issue.

800
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:34,071
You're asking me to abandon my parents.
That's a small issue?

801
00:38:34,096 --> 00:38:35,096
I didn't say that!

802
00:38:35,255 --> 00:38:36,880
Stop making me look like the villain!

803
00:38:39,911 --> 00:38:40,995
What are you trying to say?

804
00:38:41,582 --> 00:38:42,665
This is important to me.

805
00:38:43,476 --> 00:38:45,350
This is how I wish to live.

806
00:38:45,957 --> 00:38:48,248
And you're not even
taking that into consideration.

807
00:38:49,439 --> 00:38:52,731
What would I do if you
control me all the time in the future?

808
00:38:57,018 --> 00:39:00,185
I don't want someone who tells me
 to abandon my parents.

809
00:39:02,096 --> 00:39:03,762
You don't want me?
Tell me.

810
00:39:04,392 --> 00:39:05,142
You don't?

811
00:39:06,281 --> 00:39:07,156
You don't want me?

812
00:39:07,407 --> 00:39:08,074
I don't.

813
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:10,262
Happy?

814
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:12,735
I'll just drop dead.

815
00:39:46,822 --> 00:39:50,239
I tried so hard, but we just couldn't
get back together.

816
00:39:51,537 --> 00:39:53,704
Aravind stopped hanging out with us.

817
00:39:55,273 --> 00:39:57,273
A year flew by.

818
00:39:58,582 --> 00:40:01,290
Do you like it?
-It's very nice.

819
00:40:01,315 --> 00:40:04,148
Aravindh is getting engaged.

820
00:40:04,866 --> 00:40:07,367
I can't believe one of you boys
is getting married!

821
00:40:07,392 --> 00:40:09,141
You see, sister-in-law…
They're a good family.

822
00:40:09,182 --> 00:40:11,182
Aravindh is doing well in his business.

823
00:40:11,341 --> 00:40:12,883
He liked the girl, too.

824
00:40:13,003 --> 00:40:15,169
How long could him and I
live by ourselves?

825
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:16,696
Son…

826
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,294
Are you still not talking to him?

827
00:40:18,801 --> 00:40:19,717
Still fighting?

828
00:40:19,855 --> 00:40:21,022
No such thing, auntie.

829
00:40:21,166 --> 00:40:23,000
I'll talk to him.
-Okay.

830
00:40:23,426 --> 00:40:24,593
Mom, I'll be downstairs.

831
00:40:24,618 --> 00:40:27,451
He's being difficult.
We tried to talk to him so many times!

832
00:40:27,625 --> 00:40:29,124
It's not like you did something terrible.

833
00:40:29,224 --> 00:40:31,516
You went out with a girl
and didn't tell him. Big deal!

834
00:40:31,616 --> 00:40:34,823
Aravindh is running a business.
And he's getting married.

835
00:40:35,335 --> 00:40:37,377
But you're still loafing around
with this swine.

836
00:40:38,073 --> 00:40:40,698
Dad says he'll get you a job
at his office.

837
00:40:40,817 --> 00:40:41,775
Why won't you take it up?

838
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:45,925
I want to see you married, too.
-Right, like things aren't bad enough.

839
00:40:47,079 --> 00:40:48,954
Okay, I'll go to work.
Tell dad.

840
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:51,091
You mean it?
-Yes.

841
00:40:51,116 --> 00:40:51,990
Tell him.

842
00:40:52,954 --> 00:40:53,954
Right away!

843
00:40:54,835 --> 00:40:56,960
I'll go with you?
-I'm not going to the park!

844
00:40:56,985 --> 00:40:58,110
Wants to go with me…

845
00:41:01,372 --> 00:41:02,579
Let's see his wedding invite.

846
00:41:04,121 --> 00:41:06,454
Like it's the Taj Mahal.

847
00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:31,629
Hi.

848
00:41:32,421 --> 00:41:32,880
Hi.

849
00:41:34,708 --> 00:41:36,042
You look very different.

850
00:41:38,758 --> 00:41:41,257
I swear, I didn't know Aravindh is your cousin.

851
00:41:41,282 --> 00:41:44,157
After we broke up,
I wasn't interested in another relationship.

852
00:41:45,452 --> 00:41:47,952
My parents asked me.
And I said yes.

853
00:41:49,537 --> 00:41:51,828
I just found out that Aravindh is your cousin.

854
00:41:54,135 --> 00:41:55,551
I had to talk to you.

855
00:41:56,075 --> 00:42:00,574
We're going to be a part
of the same family.

856
00:42:02,424 --> 00:42:06,090
There shouldn't be any awkwardness.

857
00:42:08,897 --> 00:42:10,022
No such thing…

858
00:42:11,433 --> 00:42:12,558
We were over anyway.

859
00:42:13,021 --> 00:42:13,979
We have to move on.

860
00:42:15,244 --> 00:42:16,494
My cousin is a great guy.

861
00:42:16,519 --> 00:42:17,686
You'll be happy with him.

862
00:42:19,532 --> 00:42:20,157
Thanks.

863
00:42:24,623 --> 00:42:25,498
I'll get going, then.

864
00:42:30,049 --> 00:42:30,716
Hold on.

865
00:42:32,051 --> 00:42:35,510
Did Aravindh agree to leave his mother
to live with you?

866
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:39,387
That's why we broke up.
So I just…

867
00:42:40,007 --> 00:42:41,798
That's not why we broke up, Tamizh.

868
00:42:43,005 --> 00:42:44,796
You don't even know why we broke up.

869
00:42:45,588 --> 00:42:46,337
It's a shame.

870
00:42:47,623 --> 00:42:48,957
It's the way you treated me.

871
00:42:49,591 --> 00:42:50,341
I'm leaving.

872
00:42:51,069 --> 00:42:51,570
Bye.

873
00:43:08,404 --> 00:43:09,904
Even I can't take this, man.

874
00:43:11,174 --> 00:43:13,090
Listen. Let's just go somewhere else.

875
00:43:15,541 --> 00:43:16,666
Dude, let's go!

876
00:43:26,601 --> 00:43:30,685
It started to sink in that she was not
my girlfriend, but Aravindh's wife.

877
00:43:31,944 --> 00:43:35,486
Just like mum wanted,
I went to work at my dad's office.

878
00:43:39,261 --> 00:43:42,594
Somehow, my mom convinced me
to get married.

879
00:43:43,611 --> 00:43:46,111
They say God knows what's right for us.

880
00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:47,516
To me, Yamuna was it.

881
00:43:48,413 --> 00:43:49,455
She was life's greatest gift.

882
00:44:31,443 --> 00:44:32,151
Give me!

883
00:44:37,524 --> 00:44:40,191
You don't have to…
Alright, you're sitting already.

884
00:44:48,437 --> 00:44:51,437
It's nice and quiet, right?
-Hmmm.

885
00:44:55,410 --> 00:44:57,118
We should talk… something.

886
00:44:58,309 --> 00:44:58,934
Hmmm.

887
00:45:00,733 --> 00:45:01,317
See…

888
00:45:01,931 --> 00:45:04,639
We should talk, because
ours is an arranged marriage.

889
00:45:04,664 --> 00:45:07,039
Need to get to know each other.
-Hmmm.

890
00:45:09,797 --> 00:45:13,630
Did you like me when I first came
to your house for bride-seeing ceremony?

891
00:45:15,618 --> 00:45:16,159
Hmmm.

892
00:45:18,156 --> 00:45:20,823
If you say something apart from "Hmmm",
that would be really helpful.

893
00:45:24,626 --> 00:45:25,877
I liked you.
-Hmmm?

894
00:45:26,592 --> 00:45:28,217
I liked you.
-Hmmm.

895
00:45:30,465 --> 00:45:31,216
And you?

896
00:45:32,538 --> 00:45:33,163
Hmmm.

897
00:45:33,805 --> 00:45:34,638
What does 'Hmmm' mean?

898
00:45:35,632 --> 00:45:39,256
The exact same thing that
all your 'hmmm' meant.

899
00:45:42,499 --> 00:45:43,916
You ask me something.

900
00:45:47,439 --> 00:45:48,397
Okay, I'll ask.

901
00:45:51,205 --> 00:45:53,288
What does a husband mean to you?

902
00:45:53,313 --> 00:45:54,271
I mean…

903
00:45:55,097 --> 00:45:56,847
What do you need from a husband?

904
00:45:58,566 --> 00:46:00,109
To share my future with.

905
00:46:01,607 --> 00:46:02,941
To take good care of me.

906
00:46:05,313 --> 00:46:06,605
To feel safe.

907
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:08,880
For security…

908
00:46:11,446 --> 00:46:12,196
And you?

909
00:46:12,443 --> 00:46:13,067
Hmmm?

910
00:46:13,539 --> 00:46:15,081
What do you need from a wife?

911
00:46:17,008 --> 00:46:17,674
Me?

912
00:46:18,070 --> 00:46:21,319
I had a little brother. We'd sleep
in the living room next to each other.

913
00:46:21,344 --> 00:46:23,553
He'd always put his arm around me,
I hated it.

914
00:46:23,578 --> 00:46:24,619
I'd always push it away.

915
00:46:24,644 --> 00:46:27,227
One day, I'd gone to school.
When I came back from school…

916
00:46:27,252 --> 00:46:28,417
They told me he died in an accident.

917
00:46:28,442 --> 00:46:30,150
He was there when I left in the morning.

918
00:46:30,175 --> 00:46:32,342
How could I cope with him being dead
by afternoon?

919
00:46:32,367 --> 00:46:34,200
I had to sleep alone in the living room.

920
00:46:34,225 --> 00:46:36,203
I'd have nightmares about my brother.

921
00:46:36,228 --> 00:46:38,686
My brother would ask me,
"See, you never let me put my arm around you…"

922
00:46:38,711 --> 00:46:41,378
"Around whom will my put my arm now?"
I'd get really scared.

923
00:46:41,403 --> 00:46:42,361
And wake up out of breath.

924
00:46:42,386 --> 00:46:43,271
I'd sweat a lot.

925
00:46:43,296 --> 00:46:45,212
Then, I started sleeping next to my mother.

926
00:46:45,237 --> 00:46:47,403
I'd put my arm around her.
That was okay till a certain age.

927
00:46:47,428 --> 00:46:49,928
Then, my dad said "You're old enough
to sleep on your own"…

928
00:46:49,953 --> 00:46:51,595
And made me sleep in the living room.

929
00:46:51,737 --> 00:46:55,487
I'd sleep in the living room, get scared.
And wake up with a start!

930
00:46:57,659 --> 00:47:00,659
I want a wife…

931
00:47:01,591 --> 00:47:03,300
To sleep with my arm around her.

932
00:47:03,908 --> 00:47:05,242
That's what I want from my wife.

933
00:47:07,719 --> 00:47:10,719
Did I bore you?
-No.

934
00:47:15,688 --> 00:47:16,605
Are you hungry?

935
00:48:07,248 --> 00:48:11,290
What do I say?
Words fail me.

936
00:48:11,665 --> 00:48:15,206
When our eyes do the talking;
Words are nothing.

937
00:48:15,711 --> 00:48:19,753
This strange tingling;
I feel inside me.

938
00:48:19,908 --> 00:48:23,825
The kind that makes me blush;
I can't speak of it!

939
00:48:24,088 --> 00:48:28,379
With small desires welling up;
I stutter and stammer.

940
00:48:29,001 --> 00:48:32,512
There's a breeze wafting;
With the scent of blossoms.

941
00:48:32,537 --> 00:48:35,995
Piercing me with your gaze;
My heart does a waltz.

942
00:48:36,020 --> 00:48:39,453
We came out to give them privacy,
and he's out there playing on the slide!

943
00:48:39,590 --> 00:48:41,672
What?
He's playing on the slide?

944
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:44,656
Does our son even know
how stuff works?

945
00:48:45,050 --> 00:48:49,050
You and me, Me and you;
We are one!

946
00:48:49,514 --> 00:48:58,514
You and me, Me and you;
We are one!

947
00:49:32,041 --> 00:49:33,124
What's with the sudden plan?

948
00:49:33,238 --> 00:49:35,904
We were planning on a pilgrimage
after your wedding.

949
00:49:35,929 --> 00:49:37,013
We'll return in a week.

950
00:49:37,190 --> 00:49:39,190
Take care of the house, dear.
-Okay, mother-in-law!

951
00:49:45,338 --> 00:49:46,505
I'm leaving for work.

952
00:49:46,530 --> 00:49:47,822
Okay!

953
00:50:13,594 --> 00:50:21,802
Suddenly, out of nowhere;
Love struck me! Leaves me panting!

954
00:50:21,827 --> 00:50:29,911
Today and forever, I see us together;
With clasped hands, today and forever!

955
00:50:30,155 --> 00:50:38,322
Unspoken desires, wicked thoughts;
They weigh down on me.

956
00:50:38,834 --> 00:50:47,000
Our quest for love ends here;
I'll be yours, till the end of time.

957
00:50:47,073 --> 00:50:47,990
Someone's knocking.

958
00:50:48,032 --> 00:50:50,073
We'll answer tomorrow.
-Let me go!

959
00:50:54,652 --> 00:50:56,110
Are you well?
-Welcome home.

960
00:50:56,135 --> 00:50:57,135
Hi, dad.

961
00:50:57,160 --> 00:50:59,076
MOM : Are you well?
TAMIZH : Back so soon?

962
00:51:04,585 --> 00:51:05,585
Say something.

963
00:51:09,830 --> 00:51:13,902
With small desires welling up;
I stutter and stammer.

964
00:51:13,927 --> 00:51:17,760
There's a breeze wafting;
With the scent of blossoms.

965
00:51:17,896 --> 00:51:22,063
Piercing me with your gaze;
My heart does a waltz.

966
00:51:22,268 --> 00:51:26,477
Life's brought us together;
We're a brand new chapter.

967
00:51:26,629 --> 00:51:30,712
You and me, Me and you;
We are one!

968
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:35,167
You and me, Me and you;
We are one!

969
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:39,510
You and me, Me and you;
We are one!

970
00:51:39,562 --> 00:51:43,231
You and me, Me and you;
We are one!

971
00:51:43,256 --> 00:51:47,047
What do I say?
Words fail me.

972
00:51:47,321 --> 00:51:50,862
When our eyes do the talking;
Words are nothing.

973
00:51:51,478 --> 00:51:55,395
This strange tingling;
I feel inside me.

974
00:51:55,918 --> 00:51:59,668
The kind that makes me blush;
I can't speak of it!

975
00:52:18,074 --> 00:52:19,033
Son! Tamizh!

976
00:52:19,105 --> 00:52:19,854
Hurry up.

977
00:52:19,879 --> 00:52:21,754
You're getting me late for work
every day!

978
00:52:21,779 --> 00:52:23,528
YAMUNA: Must you go to work?
TAMIZH: I'm coming, dad.

979
00:52:23,553 --> 00:52:25,595
Hurry up.
-Be quiet, he'll come.

980
00:52:25,977 --> 00:52:26,977
Inappropriate man…

981
00:52:29,365 --> 00:52:29,907
Hello?

982
00:52:33,573 --> 00:52:34,365
Okay, sir.

983
00:52:34,406 --> 00:52:35,430
I'll tell you where to bring it.

984
00:52:35,493 --> 00:52:36,909
Okay, sir.
I'll bring it over.

985
00:52:37,888 --> 00:52:38,846
Tamizh!

986
00:52:39,636 --> 00:52:41,220
Let me just resign and come back!

987
00:52:41,618 --> 00:52:44,785
I have an errand to run.
I'll get to work on my own.

988
00:52:44,810 --> 00:52:45,810
You take a cab.

989
00:52:45,835 --> 00:52:47,044
Why did you rush me?

990
00:52:48,094 --> 00:52:50,969
Just take a cab this one day.

991
00:52:51,136 --> 00:52:52,553
Everything was just fine.

992
00:52:53,335 --> 00:52:56,085
But one day, dad came home
very worried.

993
00:53:00,917 --> 00:53:02,209
We didn't know anything.

994
00:53:03,949 --> 00:53:05,324
He looked very disturbed.

995
00:53:06,589 --> 00:53:08,173
I'd never seen him that way before.

996
00:53:09,011 --> 00:53:10,802
But he wouldn't talk about it.

997
00:53:17,020 --> 00:53:17,561
Dad!

998
00:53:17,586 --> 00:53:18,127
Dad!

999
00:53:18,461 --> 00:53:19,795
You forgot to put on your shoes.

1000
00:53:22,419 --> 00:53:23,169
Put them on.

1001
00:53:27,325 --> 00:53:28,116
Tamizh…

1002
00:53:28,141 --> 00:53:28,765
What?

1003
00:53:28,790 --> 00:53:30,207
These days, I'm…

1004
00:53:31,611 --> 00:53:34,027
My memory is getting worse, right?

1005
00:53:34,456 --> 00:53:37,290
Not really.
You forget some small things. Why?

1006
00:53:37,581 --> 00:53:39,665
I don't forget the big ones, right?

1007
00:53:39,758 --> 00:53:40,633
No, no.

1008
00:53:40,658 --> 00:53:42,366
Is this about the shoes?

1009
00:53:42,408 --> 00:53:43,324
No…

1010
00:53:46,569 --> 00:53:49,611
Let's see your aunt
on the way to the office.

1011
00:53:56,426 --> 00:53:57,843
You go in.
I'll wait here.

1012
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:11,269
What?

1013
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:14,919
Looked like you were arguing with him...

1014
00:54:14,944 --> 00:54:16,819
No, it's nothing.
That was something else.

1015
00:54:16,844 --> 00:54:17,677
Let's go.

1016
00:54:18,583 --> 00:54:19,291
Okay, fine.

1017
00:54:24,012 --> 00:54:25,179
Officer wants to see you.

1018
00:54:30,895 --> 00:54:34,040
Bring me Mr. Devanathan's accounts file.

1019
00:54:51,985 --> 00:54:53,359
What are you looking for, dad?

1020
00:54:53,384 --> 00:54:56,425
I'd kept this important file
in the locker...

1021
00:54:56,450 --> 00:54:57,075
It's missing.

1022
00:54:57,100 --> 00:54:59,017
Did you leave it somewhere
and forget?

1023
00:54:59,081 --> 00:55:00,707
I don't have memory issues!

1024
00:55:01,597 --> 00:55:04,847
You carry on. I'll handle it.
-Don't get so worked up. I'll look for it, too.

1025
00:55:06,736 --> 00:55:08,028
Dad, did you find the file?

1026
00:55:11,337 --> 00:55:12,337
I've got a headache.

1027
00:55:12,362 --> 00:55:13,362
I'm going home.

1028
00:55:20,270 --> 00:55:22,103
Where's the boy?

1029
00:55:22,516 --> 00:55:23,850
Am I in charge of him?

1030
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:25,526
For how much longer?

1031
00:55:25,898 --> 00:55:27,232
He's not a child.

1032
00:55:27,571 --> 00:55:29,112
He's married!

1033
00:55:29,976 --> 00:55:31,310
He's a responsible boy.

1034
00:55:31,941 --> 00:55:32,649
He'll manage.

1035
00:55:32,877 --> 00:55:34,751
Be careful with the file.

1036
00:55:35,109 --> 00:55:37,442
Remember… where you keep it.
Careful.

1037
00:55:42,431 --> 00:55:43,055
Mother-in-law…

1038
00:55:43,247 --> 00:55:44,414
He's still not returned.

1039
00:55:44,948 --> 00:55:46,218
His phone is switched off.

1040
00:55:46,243 --> 00:55:49,451
I've written the office number by the phone.
Call up.

1041
00:55:54,185 --> 00:55:54,851
Hello?

1042
00:55:55,389 --> 00:55:56,554
Is Mr. Tamizh there?

1043
00:55:56,631 --> 00:55:57,506
He's left, madam.

1044
00:55:57,628 --> 00:55:59,879
He's left?
Okay, thank you.

1045
00:56:03,912 --> 00:56:07,037
She gets so worked up
if he's just a little bit late…

1046
00:56:08,615 --> 00:56:09,490
Want to eat?

1047
00:56:12,035 --> 00:56:13,160
What's wrong with the guy?

1048
00:56:16,828 --> 00:56:18,661
Your dad yelled at your mom.

1049
00:56:19,870 --> 00:56:20,453
Yeah?

1050
00:56:21,682 --> 00:56:23,974
There was a file missing at work,
so he's worked up.

1051
00:56:29,525 --> 00:56:31,567
What?
Dad yelled at you?

1052
00:56:32,013 --> 00:56:32,722
Let it go.

1053
00:56:32,941 --> 00:56:34,608
He was stressed about work.

1054
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:36,222
So he'll yell at you?

1055
00:56:37,117 --> 00:56:39,081
Let it go.
What do you care?

1056
00:56:39,333 --> 00:56:42,167
Your wife got all worked up
because you came late from work…

1057
00:56:43,332 --> 00:56:44,416
One whack…

1058
00:56:44,504 --> 00:56:47,094
Buzz off.
-I'm buzzing off.

1059
00:56:48,017 --> 00:56:49,017
Scrub it nice.

1060
00:56:59,215 --> 00:56:59,802
Father-in-law?

1061
00:58:02,016 --> 00:58:03,933
He came home last week.

1062
00:58:04,140 --> 00:58:07,057
He said he forgot
where he left the money…

1063
00:58:08,297 --> 00:58:09,423
It's not that.

1064
00:58:11,001 --> 00:58:13,126
He'd forgotten some file.

1065
00:58:14,071 --> 00:58:16,196
They're saying he stole it.

1066
00:58:17,338 --> 00:58:18,046
Dear…

1067
00:58:19,242 --> 00:58:19,908
Yes?

1068
00:58:20,770 --> 00:58:21,770
I feel dizzy.

1069
00:58:24,213 --> 00:58:25,588
I'm feeling dizzy.

1070
00:58:29,845 --> 00:58:31,428
Lie down for some time.

1071
00:58:36,591 --> 00:58:37,382
Sir, come in…

1072
00:58:38,636 --> 00:58:40,678
Sorry for your loss.
-Come in, sir.

1073
00:58:41,103 --> 00:58:43,061
It's fine.
Can we speak in private?

1074
00:58:44,823 --> 00:58:46,907
Did he say something about a file?

1075
00:58:48,041 --> 00:58:49,916
My dad is not a dishonest person.
-Of course!

1076
00:58:50,295 --> 00:58:51,545
I know that very well.

1077
00:58:51,922 --> 00:58:54,006
I shall burn in hell
if I utter one bad word about him.

1078
00:58:55,191 --> 00:58:57,358
But it's my duty to ask you…

1079
00:59:00,133 --> 00:59:02,883
Did he bring some bag or something?

1080
00:59:03,599 --> 00:59:05,266
What bag, sir?

1081
00:59:05,291 --> 00:59:07,416
A bag of cash…
Did he bring..?

1082
00:59:07,441 --> 00:59:10,358
You want to know if he sold the file
and brought home money?

1083
00:59:10,505 --> 00:59:11,588
It's not like that.

1084
00:59:11,940 --> 00:59:12,607
I had to ask.

1085
00:59:13,472 --> 00:59:17,681
He lost the file, so his pension
and provident funds has been revoked.

1086
00:59:18,164 --> 00:59:20,914
You had to be removed from the job, too.
-I know, sir.

1087
00:59:21,507 --> 00:59:22,424
I'm very sorry.

1088
00:59:23,108 --> 00:59:24,857
If you need some help,
feel free to ask me.

1089
00:59:25,328 --> 00:59:26,328
Okay, sir. Thanks!

1090
00:59:27,475 --> 00:59:28,391
Take care, Tamizh.

1091
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:34,890
Take care of your mother.

1092
00:59:36,821 --> 00:59:37,612
Not resting?

1093
00:59:38,551 --> 00:59:40,259
I think I'm pregnant.

1094
00:59:49,093 --> 00:59:51,260
Everyone's talking about the suicide.

1095
00:59:51,285 --> 00:59:53,868
And there was something about
a file theft on the news.

1096
00:59:53,969 --> 00:59:56,094
The neighbours are uncomfortable.

1097
00:59:56,119 --> 01:00:00,244
If you could vacate the house
in a week's time…

1098
01:00:01,385 --> 01:00:03,177
You want us to vacate suddenly?

1099
01:00:03,458 --> 01:00:05,083
We're been paying the rents regularly.

1100
01:00:05,635 --> 01:00:06,468
No, son.

1101
01:00:07,543 --> 01:00:10,042
I can't live in this house anymore.

1102
01:00:10,949 --> 01:00:11,700
It's fine.

1103
01:00:17,645 --> 01:00:19,312
Let's go to my parents' house.

1104
01:00:21,705 --> 01:00:23,081
Why would he do such a thing?

1105
01:00:23,519 --> 01:00:25,020
Did he say what the problem was?

1106
01:00:25,537 --> 01:00:27,080
He didn't say anything.

1107
01:00:32,589 --> 01:00:34,380
Yamuna, that's for your brother.

1108
01:00:34,772 --> 01:00:37,188
Hold on. I'll make another cup
for your husband.

1109
01:00:42,985 --> 01:00:44,360
Let's go to a new house.

1110
01:00:47,090 --> 01:00:47,756
Today.

1111
01:00:50,107 --> 01:00:51,024
Is it possible?

1112
01:00:51,504 --> 01:00:52,337
My dad's gone.

1113
01:00:52,881 --> 01:00:55,172
Lost my home, my job…
everything.

1114
01:00:55,857 --> 01:00:58,524
My whole life has come
crashing down.

1115
01:01:01,748 --> 01:01:03,540
What took you so long?
-It's nothing.

1116
01:01:07,813 --> 01:01:08,563
Tamizh…

1117
01:01:09,426 --> 01:01:10,593
Yamuna hasn't eaten.

1118
01:01:10,961 --> 01:01:12,378
She's waiting for you.

1119
01:01:12,557 --> 01:01:13,224
Go to her.

1120
01:01:15,132 --> 01:01:16,715
Why have you still not eaten?

1121
01:01:17,501 --> 01:01:19,876
Do you need to be reminded constantly
that you're pregnant?

1122
01:01:22,029 --> 01:01:23,029
Here, eat up.

1123
01:01:26,993 --> 01:01:27,743
What is it?

1124
01:01:50,548 --> 01:01:51,631
This can't go on.

1125
01:01:51,656 --> 01:01:53,031
We need you to be normal.

1126
01:01:53,056 --> 01:01:54,972
We're dependant on you.

1127
01:01:55,208 --> 01:01:57,166
I didn't want to stay in my place
because...

1128
01:01:57,539 --> 01:01:59,439
I'm sure you had your reasons.

1129
01:01:59,464 --> 01:02:02,631
While we stayed there,
had someone said something to you…

1130
01:02:02,741 --> 01:02:04,365
Or treated you badly…

1131
01:02:04,784 --> 01:02:06,242
What would I do?

1132
01:02:06,751 --> 01:02:08,209
People in my family are very nice.

1133
01:02:08,234 --> 01:02:09,234
I like them.

1134
01:02:10,726 --> 01:02:12,393
But I like you more.

1135
01:02:14,298 --> 01:02:17,173
My baby should have good ties
with all his family.

1136
01:02:18,542 --> 01:02:19,251
So I had to.

1137
01:02:19,375 --> 01:02:20,917
I didn't ask you for your reasons.

1138
01:02:21,031 --> 01:02:22,198
That's what makes it so hard.

1139
01:02:22,223 --> 01:02:23,682
My mom is a widow!

1140
01:02:25,898 --> 01:02:27,106
I'm going to be a father.

1141
01:02:27,558 --> 01:02:28,850
But I can't even smile.

1142
01:02:31,445 --> 01:02:32,487
You're pregnant.

1143
01:02:33,221 --> 01:02:35,180
And you don't even have
a nice place to fall asleep.

1144
01:02:36,403 --> 01:02:37,736
Please don't cry…

1145
01:02:38,234 --> 01:02:39,984
I can't stand this!

1146
01:02:41,373 --> 01:02:42,290
I can't take it!

1147
01:02:54,381 --> 01:02:59,547
You pure soul, my loved one.
Does sorrow weigh you down?

1148
01:03:00,263 --> 01:03:05,430
Let go of your misery;
I'll carry your burden, lean on me.

1149
01:03:05,963 --> 01:03:11,339
This tide will soon pass;
Time will heal these scars.

1150
01:03:11,601 --> 01:03:17,142
Even fallen blossoms;
Shall spread their scent again.

1151
01:04:03,567 --> 01:04:08,733
I haul and haul, it never ends;
Such hardships life throws.

1152
01:04:09,299 --> 01:04:14,424
We will see a thousand million,
Countless happy smiles.

1153
01:04:15,049 --> 01:04:17,508
Bear with me, darling.

1154
01:04:17,924 --> 01:04:20,799
I'm here for you, beloved.

1155
01:04:20,864 --> 01:04:27,031
The earth, skies and space...
Our love shall transcend all.

1156
01:04:35,247 --> 01:04:40,664
You pure soul, my loved one.
Does sorrow weigh you down?

1157
01:04:40,774 --> 01:04:45,940
Let go of your misery;
I'll carry your burden, lean on me.

1158
01:04:46,835 --> 01:04:52,252
Time will heal these scars;
Our love shall be a constant.

1159
01:04:52,483 --> 01:04:58,358
Even fallen blossoms;
Shall spread their scent again.

1160
01:05:12,362 --> 01:05:15,529
Sir, you were close friends
with my dad.

1161
01:05:15,554 --> 01:05:17,429
Did he say something to you?
In the end…

1162
01:05:17,454 --> 01:05:18,591
Before he did it...

1163
01:05:18,616 --> 01:05:19,240
No.

1164
01:05:19,265 --> 01:05:20,390
He didn't say anything.

1165
01:05:20,415 --> 01:05:22,373
Did he say something about the file?

1166
01:05:23,395 --> 01:05:24,312
He didn't, son.

1167
01:05:31,615 --> 01:05:32,282
Dear…

1168
01:05:34,328 --> 01:05:35,410
The baby's moving!

1169
01:05:38,185 --> 01:05:39,018
Feel it.

1170
01:05:48,101 --> 01:05:49,810
Don't misunderstand me…

1171
01:05:50,465 --> 01:05:52,257
Our lives have taken unexpected turns.

1172
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:54,443
I know things are not the way
they were before.

1173
01:05:54,691 --> 01:05:56,691
But we need to think about the future.

1174
01:05:57,576 --> 01:06:01,743
We shouldn't miss out on
the small joys in our life.

1175
01:06:04,852 --> 01:06:07,351
I can't find out why my dad did this.

1176
01:06:08,443 --> 01:06:10,276
I asked everyone.

1177
01:06:12,461 --> 01:06:16,253
His office for 25 years, his whole world,
is calling him a thief…

1178
01:06:17,426 --> 01:06:19,509
I can't just carry on with my life.

1179
01:06:20,351 --> 01:06:22,892
I can't see the small joys around me.

1180
01:06:25,518 --> 01:06:28,019
Forgive me if I'd hurt your feelings.

1181
01:06:28,044 --> 01:06:29,294
No, it's not like that!

1182
01:06:36,370 --> 01:06:37,786
Wait for a minute!

1183
01:06:39,631 --> 01:06:41,381
Wait…

1184
01:06:45,738 --> 01:06:48,197
Are you crazy? Don't run so fast
when you're carrying.

1185
01:06:48,329 --> 01:06:50,996
You got mad at me
and left your lunch behind.

1186
01:06:51,861 --> 01:06:52,486
That's why.

1187
01:06:54,970 --> 01:06:56,846
I could never get mad at you, Yamuna.

1188
01:06:57,343 --> 01:06:58,925
Where would I go
if I got mad at you?

1189
01:06:59,480 --> 01:07:01,355
The way you left,
it didn't appear that way…

1190
01:07:07,239 --> 01:07:09,447
You're all my small joys, Yamuna.

1191
01:07:14,501 --> 01:07:15,209
Fine, come…

1192
01:07:18,572 --> 01:07:19,780
What are you doing?

1193
01:07:20,267 --> 01:07:21,184
I'll drop you home.

1194
01:07:21,373 --> 01:07:22,539
What would people think?

1195
01:07:22,564 --> 01:07:24,314
Can't a man carry his own wife?

1196
01:07:26,433 --> 01:07:27,433
I'm feeling shy!

1197
01:07:32,708 --> 01:07:33,292
Son…

1198
01:07:33,798 --> 01:07:35,048
We need to speak in private.

1199
01:07:35,073 --> 01:07:37,531
I couldn't say anything when you
came by the office.

1200
01:07:37,667 --> 01:07:38,917
I was a little hesitant.

1201
01:07:39,442 --> 01:07:40,734
But I'll tell you what I know.

1202
01:07:41,076 --> 01:07:43,087
I don't know whether or not
your dad took your file.

1203
01:07:43,112 --> 01:07:46,987
But he said that the officer gave him something
and he forgot where he left it.

1204
01:07:47,012 --> 01:07:48,805
You look tense. What's wrong?

1205
01:07:49,349 --> 01:07:51,141
The officer's cash…

1206
01:07:51,779 --> 01:07:52,821
Don't know where…

1207
01:07:53,174 --> 01:07:54,548
What cash?

1208
01:07:55,892 --> 01:07:58,433
Don't mind me.
I'm just babbling…

1209
01:07:58,850 --> 01:08:00,142
You said "cash"…

1210
01:08:00,167 --> 01:08:02,751
When I tried to ask for details,
he started covering it up.

1211
01:08:02,776 --> 01:08:05,318
Talk to the officer.
You'll find some clarity.

1212
01:08:08,818 --> 01:08:11,110
Did he bring a bag?

1213
01:08:12,763 --> 01:08:15,222
Or maybe some cash?

1214
01:08:20,382 --> 01:08:21,299
Sit down.

1215
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:24,755
Tell me.

1216
01:08:25,226 --> 01:08:25,852
Sir…

1217
01:08:26,624 --> 01:08:28,999
Did you give my father some money?

1218
01:08:30,458 --> 01:08:31,875
And he had a memory slip?

1219
01:08:32,583 --> 01:08:34,916
Just tell me, sir.
I wont talk to anyone about it.

1220
01:08:35,913 --> 01:08:37,539
Please tell me what you know.

1221
01:08:39,330 --> 01:08:40,122
Fifty million.

1222
01:08:42,269 --> 01:08:44,061
Fifty million?
-Yes, fifty million.

1223
01:08:44,441 --> 01:08:46,733
Tie it right!
-Yes, sir.

1224
01:08:47,969 --> 01:08:50,010
Hello?
-Raghavan.

1225
01:08:50,219 --> 01:08:51,011
Yes, sir!

1226
01:08:51,036 --> 01:08:52,411
Could you come by to my place?

1227
01:08:52,436 --> 01:08:54,561
Right now?
-Yes, right now.

1228
01:08:54,976 --> 01:08:56,767
To your place?
-Yes.

1229
01:08:57,021 --> 01:08:58,436
Shall I come over in half an hour?

1230
01:08:58,461 --> 01:08:59,336
Yes, come over.

1231
01:09:00,900 --> 01:09:03,777
You need to do me a favour.
-Tell me, sir.

1232
01:09:04,436 --> 01:09:07,394
Keep this bag safe for a few days.
-Okay, sir.

1233
01:09:07,570 --> 01:09:09,612
What's in the bag..?
-There's fifty million in it.

1234
01:09:10,125 --> 01:09:11,583
Return it to me when I ask for it.

1235
01:09:12,309 --> 01:09:14,399
Sir, fifty million…
It's a lot of money!

1236
01:09:15,305 --> 01:09:16,680
How could I?
-I get it.

1237
01:09:17,619 --> 01:09:18,827
You're an honest person.

1238
01:09:19,417 --> 01:09:20,834
But I'm not like you.

1239
01:09:21,431 --> 01:09:22,723
This won't work for you.

1240
01:09:23,658 --> 01:09:26,699
I've got a tip-off that the Central Bureau of
Investigation is raiding me tomorrow.

1241
01:09:27,357 --> 01:09:29,191
I can't trust anybody now.

1242
01:09:29,361 --> 01:09:30,694
Keep it for me till then.

1243
01:09:30,751 --> 01:09:33,085
It's not right, sir…
-Please, Raghavan.

1244
01:09:33,755 --> 01:09:35,797
If you don't help me,
I'll be arrested.

1245
01:09:36,096 --> 01:09:37,554
I will lose my respect, dignity.

1246
01:09:37,984 --> 01:09:40,066
My wife and kids will be on the streets.

1247
01:09:42,489 --> 01:09:43,197
Please, Raghavan.

1248
01:09:44,915 --> 01:09:45,624
Okay, sir.

1249
01:09:45,649 --> 01:09:47,566
When I asked him for the cash
after six months.

1250
01:09:47,874 --> 01:09:48,667
Where's the cash?

1251
01:09:48,733 --> 01:09:50,567
Sir, it's…

1252
01:09:51,176 --> 01:09:52,176
Yes, Raghavan?

1253
01:09:52,894 --> 01:09:54,270
The cash…
-The cash?

1254
01:09:55,428 --> 01:09:57,261
I don't know where I kept it.

1255
01:09:58,463 --> 01:09:59,172
What?

1256
01:10:00,530 --> 01:10:02,031
You don't know where you kept it?

1257
01:10:02,188 --> 01:10:03,397
I had given it…

1258
01:10:05,130 --> 01:10:06,130
I'm not…

1259
01:10:07,453 --> 01:10:10,786
I left it somewhere
but I've forgotten.

1260
01:10:10,811 --> 01:10:12,060
Raghavan.
-Sir?

1261
01:10:12,085 --> 01:10:15,751
You may forget where you left your pen
or your wallet.

1262
01:10:17,017 --> 01:10:19,725
But you're saying you forgot
50 million rupees of cash?

1263
01:10:19,962 --> 01:10:20,837
I just…

1264
01:10:22,394 --> 01:10:24,768
I don't understand, sir.
-Me neither.

1265
01:10:25,654 --> 01:10:27,236
What I gave you was black money.

1266
01:10:28,016 --> 01:10:30,141
There's no evidence
that I gave you that money.

1267
01:10:30,830 --> 01:10:33,873
Nor is there evidence
that you have misplaced it.

1268
01:10:34,547 --> 01:10:35,213
Right?

1269
01:10:36,195 --> 01:10:38,028
Sir, I don't want that money!

1270
01:10:38,053 --> 01:10:40,428
I only said I don't know
where I left it.

1271
01:10:45,010 --> 01:10:46,010
Okay, you may go.

1272
01:10:46,232 --> 01:10:46,982
Sir?

1273
01:10:47,497 --> 01:10:48,247
You may go.

1274
01:10:52,307 --> 01:10:53,432
Watch out, Raghavan.

1275
01:10:54,713 --> 01:10:56,212
Big money is always trouble.

1276
01:10:56,237 --> 01:10:59,321
Think about it,
get some rest and clear your mind.

1277
01:11:00,310 --> 01:11:02,393
But when you come tomorrow,
bring the cash.

1278
01:11:02,418 --> 01:11:03,626
Hard to believe, right?

1279
01:11:03,651 --> 01:11:05,818
My father won't steal, sir!

1280
01:11:05,843 --> 01:11:07,427
Which is why I trusted him.

1281
01:11:08,139 --> 01:11:09,306
Where's my money, then?

1282
01:11:15,347 --> 01:11:17,389
So the file that my father was
accused of losing...?

1283
01:11:21,091 --> 01:11:22,633
Sir, that file is missing.

1284
01:11:22,692 --> 01:11:24,857
I looked everywhere.
But I can't find it.

1285
01:11:24,899 --> 01:11:28,149
Yesterday, it was the cash.
Today, it's the file.

1286
01:11:28,174 --> 01:11:29,799
I remember very clearly…

1287
01:11:29,824 --> 01:11:32,075
I swear it was in my locker!

1288
01:11:32,100 --> 01:11:33,225
Where did it go, then?

1289
01:11:34,088 --> 01:11:35,755
You're losing a lot of things, Raghavan.

1290
01:11:37,403 --> 01:11:39,362
Do you know what the file is worth?

1291
01:11:40,803 --> 01:11:42,845
If we don't get the file,
not just you…

1292
01:11:43,491 --> 01:11:45,408
Your son will be arrested, too.

1293
01:11:47,583 --> 01:11:49,541
There are two women in your house.

1294
01:11:50,558 --> 01:11:52,600
If the two of you end up in prison…

1295
01:11:53,194 --> 01:11:54,236
What would happen to them?

1296
01:11:56,367 --> 01:11:57,367
Think about it.

1297
01:11:58,583 --> 01:12:00,167
Anything could happen to them.

1298
01:12:01,352 --> 01:12:02,268
Sir, I…

1299
01:12:02,791 --> 01:12:04,833
I had it in my locker.
-Raghavan!

1300
01:12:04,961 --> 01:12:06,294
First, find the money.

1301
01:12:07,388 --> 01:12:09,846
Once you find the money,
you'll automatically find the file.

1302
01:12:09,871 --> 01:12:10,662
Got it?

1303
01:12:10,810 --> 01:12:14,518
I thought he'd return my money
if I threaten him with the missing file…

1304
01:12:14,543 --> 01:12:16,043
But I didn't think
he'd do this.

1305
01:12:16,206 --> 01:12:17,455
Find the money.

1306
01:12:17,956 --> 01:12:19,414
You'll automatically find the file, too.

1307
01:12:20,584 --> 01:12:22,459
I'll get you your job back, too.

1308
01:12:25,184 --> 01:12:29,766
These days…
My memory is getting worse, right?

1309
01:12:41,356 --> 01:12:42,356
How would I know?

1310
01:12:42,962 --> 01:12:46,170
He had a memory slip.
Why am I being interrogated?

1311
01:12:46,195 --> 01:12:48,289
Why are you getting so worked up?
-What do you expect?

1312
01:12:48,314 --> 01:12:49,935
I just wanted to know
if my dad said something to you.

1313
01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:52,585
You're his son. If he hasn't told you,
why would he tell me?

1314
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:55,506
Dude…

1315
01:12:56,360 --> 01:12:57,694
Don't misunderstand me.

1316
01:12:58,115 --> 01:13:00,823
Your dad might have had
another family or something…

1317
01:13:01,063 --> 01:13:03,553
Maybe he had to pay for those children?

1318
01:13:05,841 --> 01:13:07,049
If you don't know,
just say so.

1319
01:13:08,452 --> 01:13:11,023
Don't you speak that way.
Or you'll pay for it.

1320
01:13:14,397 --> 01:13:18,898
You told that boy the truth,
what if he brings the cash?

1321
01:13:18,923 --> 01:13:21,173
I just need to know
what happened to my money.

1322
01:13:21,288 --> 01:13:23,580
If he brings the cash, we'll see.

1323
01:13:27,516 --> 01:13:28,808
Don't mind my asking…

1324
01:13:28,940 --> 01:13:31,232
First, his father asked about the money.

1325
01:13:31,257 --> 01:13:32,757
And now, it's Tamizh.

1326
01:13:32,910 --> 01:13:34,073
What's happening, Aravindh?

1327
01:13:34,098 --> 01:13:36,556
Are you involved in this somehow?

1328
01:13:36,734 --> 01:13:38,276
I'm really pissed off.

1329
01:13:38,439 --> 01:13:39,480
Just go away.

1330
01:13:39,677 --> 01:13:41,635
Leave me alone.
-Why are you pissed off?

1331
01:13:41,660 --> 01:13:44,368
I said leave me alone.
I can't tell you.

1332
01:13:44,393 --> 01:13:45,727
Why can't you tell me?

1333
01:13:45,752 --> 01:13:48,544
I said I can't.
-I want to know why!

1334
01:13:48,876 --> 01:13:50,501
What is it that you can't tell me?

1335
01:13:51,210 --> 01:13:53,460
You must be hiding something.
-Yes, woman.

1336
01:13:53,666 --> 01:13:54,707
But I can't tell you.

1337
01:13:55,092 --> 01:13:57,051
You'd tell on me to your ex-boyfriend.

1338
01:13:57,126 --> 01:13:58,210
Why should I tell you?

1339
01:14:00,556 --> 01:14:01,390
My ex-boyfriend?

1340
01:14:01,518 --> 01:14:03,394
Drop the act.

1341
01:14:03,838 --> 01:14:05,546
Isn't Tamizh your ex-boyfriend?

1342
01:14:07,913 --> 01:14:08,913
How did you know?

1343
01:14:09,704 --> 01:14:10,830
How did you know?

1344
01:14:11,126 --> 01:14:12,502
I saw it.

1345
01:14:13,122 --> 01:14:14,330
I saw it all.

1346
01:14:15,179 --> 01:14:17,638
I saw him avoiding me
and running after you.

1347
01:14:18,855 --> 01:14:20,272
I followed him.

1348
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:21,998
I saw you.

1349
01:14:22,023 --> 01:14:23,523
I saw how pretty you were.

1350
01:14:23,690 --> 01:14:26,422
I saw that he always
got better things in life than me.

1351
01:14:26,613 --> 01:14:29,697
But I had nothing
to do with your break-up.

1352
01:14:31,066 --> 01:14:33,107
So, I thought "Why not take her?"

1353
01:14:33,949 --> 01:14:36,574
I told my mom that I liked this girl….

1354
01:14:37,500 --> 01:14:38,876
And to talk to her parents.

1355
01:14:39,317 --> 01:14:39,941
And now…

1356
01:14:41,097 --> 01:14:41,930
You're mine.

1357
01:14:42,056 --> 01:14:43,806
Why do you hate him so much?

1358
01:14:46,837 --> 01:14:49,129
So... his dad's money?

1359
01:14:49,154 --> 01:14:50,237
I took it!

1360
01:14:50,506 --> 01:14:51,714
I've got the money.

1361
01:14:53,332 --> 01:14:55,124
What do you want me to do?

1362
01:14:55,799 --> 01:14:59,256
There's fifty million in this.
-Fifty million?

1363
01:14:59,752 --> 01:15:01,210
How did you get so much money?

1364
01:15:01,235 --> 01:15:03,694
This is my officer's unaccounted money, it seems.

1365
01:15:03,719 --> 01:15:06,186
He's got a tip-off about a raid
at his house.

1366
01:15:06,211 --> 01:15:09,295
So he's asked me to keep this money
for a few days.

1367
01:15:09,513 --> 01:15:12,680
Uncle, what if there's trouble?
-There won't be any trouble.

1368
01:15:12,789 --> 01:15:15,373
Why did you bring it to me?
-I live in the Officer's Quarters.

1369
01:15:15,398 --> 01:15:16,561
How could I take this money home?

1370
01:15:16,586 --> 01:15:19,211
Besides, there was a robbery
at the neighbours' last week.

1371
01:15:19,236 --> 01:15:21,236
I brought it here
because it would be safer.

1372
01:15:21,261 --> 01:15:23,428
I'll get it back from you
when the Officer asks.

1373
01:15:23,453 --> 01:15:24,829
Just keep it safe.

1374
01:15:28,060 --> 01:15:30,561
Okay, uncle.
But don't mention it to mom.

1375
01:15:30,782 --> 01:15:33,574
Black money, raids… she'll worry.
-I won't tell her.

1376
01:15:33,599 --> 01:15:36,127
And you don't mention anything
to Tamizh or your aunt.

1377
01:15:36,152 --> 01:15:37,527
They'll ask too many questions.

1378
01:15:37,552 --> 01:15:38,969
Especially Tamizh!

1379
01:15:38,994 --> 01:15:42,202
I thought I'd use it for my business
and return it in a few days.

1380
01:15:42,227 --> 01:15:45,061
I didn't think he'd come back
and ask for it so soon.

1381
01:15:45,086 --> 01:15:46,462
The cash I gave you...?

1382
01:15:46,832 --> 01:15:48,790
The officer wants it back.

1383
01:15:48,815 --> 01:15:49,690
Get it.

1384
01:15:50,651 --> 01:15:52,568
What are you talking about, uncle?
What cash?

1385
01:15:52,973 --> 01:15:57,348
The day before your wedding,
I gave you this officer's cash, right?

1386
01:15:57,373 --> 01:15:58,789
The black bag. That one.

1387
01:15:58,950 --> 01:16:00,075
Go, get it.

1388
01:16:00,592 --> 01:16:02,551
Uncle, I have no idea what you're talking about.

1389
01:16:03,200 --> 01:16:06,700
On the day of my wedding…
A black bag?

1390
01:16:07,385 --> 01:16:08,135
You didn't.

1391
01:16:08,530 --> 01:16:10,822
You didn't give me any bag, uncle.

1392
01:16:10,847 --> 01:16:12,764
Stop joking, boy.
Bring the bag.

1393
01:16:12,789 --> 01:16:15,997
Uncle, I'm very serious.
You didn't give me any bag.

1394
01:16:16,022 --> 01:16:16,606
Boy!

1395
01:16:17,370 --> 01:16:18,703
Is this something you joke about?

1396
01:16:19,495 --> 01:16:20,119
Go, now.

1397
01:16:21,477 --> 01:16:22,352
What's happened?

1398
01:16:22,524 --> 01:16:25,149
My superior officer had asked me
to keep his cash for him.

1399
01:16:25,174 --> 01:16:27,433
I gave it to this boy for safekeeping.

1400
01:16:27,458 --> 01:16:28,798
Now he tells me I never gave it!

1401
01:16:28,823 --> 01:16:30,323
Is this something to joke about?

1402
01:16:30,896 --> 01:16:32,021
What's this?

1403
01:16:32,309 --> 01:16:33,183
Return his bag.

1404
01:16:33,208 --> 01:16:35,001
Mom, I don't even know
what he's talking about.

1405
01:16:35,322 --> 01:16:37,239
Why would I refuse it if he had
given it to me?

1406
01:16:37,303 --> 01:16:37,887
Uncle…

1407
01:16:38,202 --> 01:16:40,077
It's slipped from your memory
and you're babbling now...

1408
01:16:40,102 --> 01:16:42,060
I've got a memory slip?

1409
01:16:43,970 --> 01:16:44,762
Hit me, uncle.

1410
01:16:45,126 --> 01:16:45,750
Hit me!

1411
01:16:46,647 --> 01:16:49,647
My father is dead, anyone can barge into
my house and hit me.

1412
01:16:49,672 --> 01:16:51,672
How could you raise your arm
at him, brother?

1413
01:16:51,937 --> 01:16:53,229
He says you didn't give it.

1414
01:16:53,943 --> 01:16:55,152
My son doesn't lie.

1415
01:16:55,216 --> 01:16:56,841
Uncle, don't take this the wrong way.

1416
01:16:57,345 --> 01:16:59,637
Your memory has been getting
worse by the day.

1417
01:17:00,238 --> 01:17:02,655
I kept telling Tamizh
that you needed to see a doctor.

1418
01:17:02,820 --> 01:17:03,778
See what's happened?

1419
01:17:06,465 --> 01:17:08,174
I remember very clearly...

1420
01:17:08,199 --> 01:17:09,866
I did give you the cash.

1421
01:17:10,414 --> 01:17:11,372
I did…

1422
01:17:11,397 --> 01:17:13,397
You must have
forgotten it somewhere, uncle.

1423
01:17:18,488 --> 01:17:20,447
I thought it was done.

1424
01:17:20,472 --> 01:17:22,347
But he came back with Tamizh
the next day…

1425
01:17:22,372 --> 01:17:25,956
I thought maybe he knew about it, too.
But he hadn't told him.

1426
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:27,873
Aravindh, please.

1427
01:17:28,082 --> 01:17:29,541
If you've got it,
give it back to me.

1428
01:17:29,566 --> 01:17:30,982
Not for any other reason.

1429
01:17:31,605 --> 01:17:35,229
I'm scared that I'm going crazy!

1430
01:17:35,519 --> 01:17:36,852
Why are you doing this, uncle?

1431
01:17:37,174 --> 01:17:39,216
I don't have the money,
how could I return it?

1432
01:17:42,683 --> 01:17:45,058
I didn't want to use the money
immediately after he died…

1433
01:17:45,083 --> 01:17:47,958
I was just about to invest it in business
but Tamizh comes and asks me now.

1434
01:17:48,688 --> 01:17:50,342
Should I keep waiting for them?

1435
01:17:50,367 --> 01:17:51,367
You're not human!

1436
01:17:51,392 --> 01:17:52,642
You're a monster.
-Get lost.

1437
01:17:53,079 --> 01:17:54,870
Is it hard-earned money?

1438
01:17:55,217 --> 01:17:57,008
This is someone's black money.

1439
01:17:57,436 --> 01:17:59,769
I'm ashamed of you.
-Where are you going?

1440
01:17:59,955 --> 01:18:01,372
Let go!
-What are you..?

1441
01:18:09,240 --> 01:18:09,907
Yamuna…

1442
01:18:12,682 --> 01:18:13,640
How are things?

1443
01:18:15,443 --> 01:18:16,318
Going on.

1444
01:18:16,455 --> 01:18:17,558
Everyone at home..?

1445
01:18:18,233 --> 01:18:18,982
They're alive.

1446
01:18:22,348 --> 01:18:23,098
And Tamizh?

1447
01:18:24,413 --> 01:18:27,537
What about Tamizh?
He's the same.

1448
01:18:29,238 --> 01:18:31,030
He goes to work at the shop
in the morning.

1449
01:18:31,518 --> 01:18:32,643
He returns only at night.

1450
01:18:33,565 --> 01:18:35,898
My mother-in-law just sits
in one corner…

1451
01:18:37,861 --> 01:18:39,278
Things are not the way they were.

1452
01:18:40,989 --> 01:18:43,031
All that happiness,
the laughter…

1453
01:18:44,464 --> 01:18:47,548
Always wondering
what happened to dad.

1454
01:18:48,806 --> 01:18:50,182
And the worst part...

1455
01:18:50,517 --> 01:18:53,059
There was this chirpy little boy in him.

1456
01:18:54,438 --> 01:18:55,355
He's missing.

1457
01:18:58,708 --> 01:19:01,791
Bottling up so much,
unable to talk to me…

1458
01:19:03,648 --> 01:19:05,356
He's never harmed anyone.

1459
01:19:07,177 --> 01:19:08,718
He wept like a child yesterday.

1460
01:19:09,243 --> 01:19:10,493
Why should he weep?

1461
01:19:16,747 --> 01:19:19,246
I'm whining about my issues
like a mad person…

1462
01:19:20,550 --> 01:19:21,717
And making you cry, too.

1463
01:19:21,904 --> 01:19:23,362
No, it's not that!

1464
01:19:23,467 --> 01:19:25,342
I shouldn't have spoken that way.

1465
01:19:25,702 --> 01:19:26,327
I'm sorry.

1466
01:19:28,498 --> 01:19:30,831
No, listen to me.

1467
01:19:31,341 --> 01:19:33,257
Tamizh's dad…

1468
01:19:34,705 --> 01:19:35,913
Aravidh is the reason he died.

1469
01:19:35,938 --> 01:19:39,355
The money that Tamizh's dad gave…
Aravindh has got it.

1470
01:19:49,805 --> 01:19:51,597
I raised him like a son.

1471
01:19:53,657 --> 01:19:55,198
Why did he do that?

1472
01:19:57,778 --> 01:19:59,111
Mom, don't cry.

1473
01:19:59,304 --> 01:20:01,887
No.
I have to see him.

1474
01:20:01,912 --> 01:20:03,287
I have to see his face.
-No, mom.

1475
01:20:03,312 --> 01:20:06,187
I want to see the man who killed dad…
-No, mom. Listen to me.

1476
01:20:07,091 --> 01:20:07,674
Mom…

1477
01:20:09,532 --> 01:20:10,615
Why did he..?

1478
01:20:12,619 --> 01:20:14,369
Don't let him get away with this, Tamizh.

1479
01:20:15,657 --> 01:20:16,906
Don't let him get away.

1480
01:20:19,935 --> 01:20:21,518
Make him pay.

1481
01:22:22,122 --> 01:22:23,746
I already looked all over
the house.

1482
01:22:25,588 --> 01:22:26,504
The cash is not here.

1483
01:22:55,052 --> 01:22:57,968
Aravindh brought these documents
to lease a plot.

1484
01:22:57,993 --> 01:22:59,493
I don't know anything about it.

1485
01:23:10,367 --> 01:23:11,242
Hello, sir.
-Tell me.

1486
01:23:11,378 --> 01:23:13,877
Aravindh asked me to meet you.
-We'll seal the deal tomorrow.

1487
01:23:13,950 --> 01:23:14,741
What now?

1488
01:23:14,846 --> 01:23:18,096
We shall seal the deal,
but he wanted us to go over the details.

1489
01:23:18,121 --> 01:23:20,328
I've told you a dozen times.

1490
01:23:20,495 --> 01:23:21,786
Total investment- 10 million.

1491
01:23:21,811 --> 01:23:23,561
You'll get returns of 500 thousand
 to a million in a month.

1492
01:23:23,586 --> 01:23:25,752
It's a booming locality,
with IT companies and call centers.

1493
01:23:26,183 --> 01:23:27,600
I've got many offers for the place.

1494
01:23:27,625 --> 01:23:30,208
I'm giving it to you because
you're paying it all in black money.

1495
01:23:30,476 --> 01:23:32,976
We're okay with the deal,
but the venue…

1496
01:23:33,070 --> 01:23:35,968
We sign all our deals at the family room
in Shwetha Park hotel.

1497
01:23:35,993 --> 01:23:37,784
Be there by 7 A.M.
-Shwetha Park…

1498
01:23:37,809 --> 01:23:38,642
Okay, sir.

1499
01:23:38,667 --> 01:23:41,375
But instead of 7 A.M,
could you make it 9?

1500
01:23:41,400 --> 01:23:42,692
Auspicious time...

1501
01:23:42,717 --> 01:23:44,508
Okay!
-I'll see you there.

1502
01:24:00,995 --> 01:24:03,703
You've come to the right address, dude.
Come on in.

1503
01:24:11,558 --> 01:24:12,141
Sit down.

1504
01:24:15,054 --> 01:24:16,803
I prayed so hard…

1505
01:24:17,648 --> 01:24:18,939
That you shouldn't turn up here.

1506
01:24:19,050 --> 01:24:21,050
And you shouldn't
be the one holding this cash.

1507
01:24:22,756 --> 01:24:23,965
How could you?

1508
01:24:25,235 --> 01:24:26,485
My father is dead.

1509
01:24:27,411 --> 01:24:29,619
And you act like such a thing
never even happened.

1510
01:24:30,953 --> 01:24:32,703
My mom raised you like a son!

1511
01:24:34,667 --> 01:24:37,000
I didn't think your dad would
commit suicide.

1512
01:24:37,991 --> 01:24:38,658
But I…

1513
01:24:39,229 --> 01:24:40,396
Really need this money now.

1514
01:24:41,331 --> 01:24:41,955
Maybe…

1515
01:24:43,743 --> 01:24:45,285
We could split this money between us.

1516
01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:48,462
You want to split this money?

1517
01:24:49,698 --> 01:24:51,823
Didn't you say my dad had another family?

1518
01:24:53,702 --> 01:24:54,910
You're a good man.

1519
01:24:55,663 --> 01:24:56,412
Don't…

1520
01:24:56,803 --> 01:24:57,314
Don't!

1521
01:24:59,455 --> 01:25:02,204
Everytime you started a business
and lost money…

1522
01:25:02,294 --> 01:25:04,377
My dad would worry night and day.

1523
01:25:05,662 --> 01:25:07,036
How could you do this?

1524
01:25:07,319 --> 01:25:08,944
Aren't we made of the same blood?

1525
01:25:26,324 --> 01:25:28,074
I'll give you twenty four hours.

1526
01:25:28,608 --> 01:25:32,149
Return the remaining money
and fall at my mom's feet to apologise.

1527
01:25:32,720 --> 01:25:35,304
Take a minute over twenty four hours…

1528
01:25:51,384 --> 01:25:52,092
Hema!

1529
01:25:52,777 --> 01:25:53,486
Hema!

1530
01:25:54,816 --> 01:25:55,525
Hema!

1531
01:26:00,420 --> 01:26:03,503
You just went and blurted everything
to him, didn't you?

1532
01:26:06,936 --> 01:26:09,061
You can't just hit me.
I'm not that kind of girl.

1533
01:26:09,531 --> 01:26:10,489
You'll get it back.

1534
01:26:11,669 --> 01:26:13,836
What are you going to do?
Huh?

1535
01:26:16,035 --> 01:26:17,451
You're not loyal to your husband.

1536
01:26:17,476 --> 01:26:19,062
You're no woman.
-First…

1537
01:26:19,468 --> 01:26:20,801
Make sure you're a man.

1538
01:26:21,365 --> 01:26:21,990
Next…

1539
01:26:22,315 --> 01:26:23,857
We'll think about whether or not
I'm a woman.

1540
01:26:24,572 --> 01:26:26,364
He means more to you
than me?

1541
01:26:27,704 --> 01:26:28,579
Answer me!

1542
01:26:29,161 --> 01:26:31,911
He's more important to you?
-I can answer that question.

1543
01:26:32,430 --> 01:26:33,097
But…

1544
01:26:33,743 --> 01:26:35,159
You'll find it very humiliating.

1545
01:26:36,107 --> 01:26:36,816
Is that okay?

1546
01:26:38,591 --> 01:26:42,299
Return the remaining money
before things get ugly.

1547
01:26:43,261 --> 01:26:44,332
Don't be cheap.

1548
01:27:07,732 --> 01:27:09,232
What is it?
-Come up here.

1549
01:27:09,369 --> 01:27:11,160
Quick! Look over there.
-What?

1550
01:27:12,170 --> 01:27:14,837
That man was pointing at our home
and speaking over the phone.

1551
01:27:15,215 --> 01:27:18,215
The money is at our home.
I'm scared.

1552
01:27:20,658 --> 01:27:22,533
It's probably nothing,
I'll talk to them.

1553
01:27:22,893 --> 01:27:24,352
Stay inside, okay?

1554
01:27:44,447 --> 01:27:45,696
Looking for me?

1555
01:29:07,007 --> 01:29:08,632
You took the money from me!

1556
01:29:11,059 --> 01:29:14,363
I know how to get it back from you.
-Is that why you sent those men after me?

1557
01:29:14,388 --> 01:29:15,054
What?

1558
01:29:15,456 --> 01:29:16,164
Send men?

1559
01:29:17,118 --> 01:29:19,160
I'll snatch the money from you
on my own.

1560
01:29:21,074 --> 01:29:21,698
Buddy…

1561
01:29:22,136 --> 01:29:25,178
Why do you speak like
that's your hard earned money?

1562
01:29:25,802 --> 01:29:26,886
Watch out, buddy.

1563
01:29:27,428 --> 01:29:29,595
Money can make you a rich man.

1564
01:29:29,829 --> 01:29:32,412
But it can also make a mad man.

1565
01:29:33,242 --> 01:29:33,993
Be careful.

1566
01:29:40,973 --> 01:29:42,098
I will send men.

1567
01:29:46,394 --> 01:29:47,977
They're about to raid your house.

1568
01:29:48,002 --> 01:29:50,488
What? A raid?
-For Devanathan's file…

1569
01:29:50,513 --> 01:29:51,734
Why would the file be here?

1570
01:29:51,759 --> 01:29:53,093
I don't know.
Just be prepared.

1571
01:29:53,762 --> 01:29:54,428
What is it?

1572
01:29:54,723 --> 01:29:57,597
They're coming here
to look for that file. But why…

1573
01:29:58,589 --> 01:29:59,381
The money!

1574
01:30:07,122 --> 01:30:09,456
Auntie, my mom said she'd visit this evening.
-Dude!

1575
01:30:09,481 --> 01:30:10,689
Take this and leave.

1576
01:30:10,714 --> 01:30:11,672
What's happened?
-It's nothing.

1577
01:30:11,697 --> 01:30:12,989
Just take this and leave.

1578
01:30:21,608 --> 01:30:25,482
We're from the Income Tax department.
We have a search warrant.

1579
01:30:41,398 --> 01:30:42,857
You wouldn't take my word for it.

1580
01:30:43,149 --> 01:30:45,149
We're so devastated.
Why do you make it worse, sir?

1581
01:30:45,491 --> 01:30:46,616
Sorry for the trouble.

1582
01:30:52,519 --> 01:30:54,564
So, buddy…
They raided your house?

1583
01:30:54,826 --> 01:30:56,576
I knew this was your doing.

1584
01:30:57,206 --> 01:30:59,539
But it didn't end the way you wanted.
-Oh?

1585
01:31:00,041 --> 01:31:02,041
You gave the money to Kumaran?

1586
01:31:03,470 --> 01:31:06,054
I think you may have to
take Kumaran to the hospital.

1587
01:31:11,881 --> 01:31:15,422
Didn't I tell you I'd take the money
back from you?

1588
01:31:15,640 --> 01:31:17,807
Money chooses the worthy.

1589
01:31:18,066 --> 01:31:19,732
Your family is not worthy.

1590
01:31:20,132 --> 01:31:23,507
Quit this hero act
and try to save your family.

1591
01:31:23,532 --> 01:31:25,781
Some men are born to win.

1592
01:31:25,806 --> 01:31:27,264
And some are born to lose.

1593
01:31:27,378 --> 01:31:28,794
I was born to win.

1594
01:31:29,024 --> 01:31:30,607
And you were born to lose to me.

1595
01:31:34,900 --> 01:31:37,207
I tried really hard,
but I couldn't save the money.

1596
01:31:37,715 --> 01:31:38,504
I'm sorry, man.

1597
01:31:50,114 --> 01:31:51,822
Tamizh here.
-Tell me, son.

1598
01:31:52,445 --> 01:31:56,654
I want the call records of the past 15 days
for a number. Possible?

1599
01:31:56,679 --> 01:32:00,538
We work in the Income Tax department.
Can do, within 15 minutes!

1600
01:32:00,563 --> 01:32:01,146
Come over.

1601
01:32:01,171 --> 01:32:03,848
His number has been switched off
for the past 15 days.

1602
01:32:03,873 --> 01:32:05,832
He's turned it on just to dial
these numbers.

1603
01:32:05,857 --> 01:32:09,538
Bring me the installment details
for the 23 unsold apartments.

1604
01:32:09,563 --> 01:32:10,813
Man, what's wrong?

1605
01:32:11,049 --> 01:32:12,674
Why do people know the details
of our deal?

1606
01:32:12,786 --> 01:32:15,036
Why would I talk?
One of your men came…

1607
01:32:15,061 --> 01:32:17,727
And asked for details.
Changed appointment from 7 to 9 A.M.

1608
01:32:17,938 --> 01:32:19,562
You'd just discuss it with a stranger?

1609
01:32:19,587 --> 01:32:20,545
This is Hema's number.

1610
01:32:20,570 --> 01:32:22,570
This is his mother's number.
-Call up this number.

1611
01:32:26,850 --> 01:32:28,600
You should have phoned
and checked with me!

1612
01:32:30,788 --> 01:32:31,580
Gen Builders.

1613
01:32:32,339 --> 01:32:33,964
This is the builder's number.

1614
01:32:33,989 --> 01:32:34,615
Okay.

1615
01:32:35,245 --> 01:32:36,287
I have the money now.

1616
01:32:36,429 --> 01:32:37,304
Is our deal on?

1617
01:32:37,329 --> 01:32:38,578
The property is sold out.

1618
01:32:38,850 --> 01:32:41,429
I get the feeling you're trouble.
This money, too!

1619
01:32:41,454 --> 01:32:42,788
Random men are barging in!

1620
01:32:42,915 --> 01:32:44,123
I won't deal with you.

1621
01:32:45,445 --> 01:32:46,903
He's called this number often.

1622
01:32:51,981 --> 01:32:53,482
Hello.
-Hello, who is this?

1623
01:32:53,635 --> 01:32:57,010
Sir, it's about the money…
-What money?

1624
01:32:57,225 --> 01:33:00,475
For the business…
-What business?

1625
01:33:00,500 --> 01:33:00,959
Huh?

1626
01:33:00,984 --> 01:33:03,858
I'm calling about the money!
-Who are you?

1627
01:33:03,883 --> 01:33:06,465
I was given your contact.
That's why I'm calling.

1628
01:33:06,490 --> 01:33:08,907
Who gave you?
-It's this guy…

1629
01:33:08,932 --> 01:33:10,389
You've got the wrong number.
Hang up.

1630
01:33:13,216 --> 01:33:14,841
We need to find this address.

1631
01:33:17,279 --> 01:33:18,863
So… Hema darling!

1632
01:33:19,344 --> 01:33:20,386
What are you upto?

1633
01:33:21,204 --> 01:33:23,496
Scheming ways to destroy
your husband?

1634
01:33:24,419 --> 01:33:25,335
He thinks…

1635
01:33:25,528 --> 01:33:27,403
He can take my money?

1636
01:33:28,071 --> 01:33:30,749
Here's the money he snatched
from me.

1637
01:33:30,774 --> 01:33:33,649
Wish you could
see your ex-lover getting humiliated.

1638
01:33:33,832 --> 01:33:34,749
Want to hear it?

1639
01:33:35,008 --> 01:33:37,591
Want to hear him crying desperately?

1640
01:33:44,813 --> 01:33:46,314
Hello.
-So, Tamizh…

1641
01:33:46,730 --> 01:33:48,273
Having a sob-fest with the family?

1642
01:33:48,605 --> 01:33:50,814
They'll face so much suffering,
thanks to you.

1643
01:33:51,025 --> 01:33:51,942
Speak out, buddy.

1644
01:33:51,988 --> 01:33:55,155
Your lover can hear you on the speaker.
-Just hang up, man.

1645
01:33:55,597 --> 01:33:57,987
You'll be embarrassed before your wife.
-Embarrass me, huh?

1646
01:33:58,193 --> 01:34:00,098
How, darling?
-I'm telling you again.

1647
01:34:00,231 --> 01:34:02,601
Hang up. You're embarrassing yourself.

1648
01:34:03,565 --> 01:34:04,857
Try and embarrass me!

1649
01:34:04,882 --> 01:34:05,773
Let me see.

1650
01:34:06,591 --> 01:34:07,923
I meant what I said.

1651
01:34:08,353 --> 01:34:10,852
I was born to win over you.

1652
01:34:10,886 --> 01:34:12,803
Remember the name Amirtha Sen?

1653
01:34:14,410 --> 01:34:15,493
Ring a bell?

1654
01:34:17,810 --> 01:34:19,019
Mr. Amirtha Sen?

1655
01:34:19,378 --> 01:34:22,336
You are?
-I've spoken to him over phone.

1656
01:34:24,548 --> 01:34:25,214
Who are you?

1657
01:34:25,271 --> 01:34:27,479
Sir, my friend has gone missing.

1658
01:34:27,779 --> 01:34:30,572
We're checking with all the numbers
he last dialled.

1659
01:34:30,648 --> 01:34:31,707
Really? What's his name?

1660
01:34:31,732 --> 01:34:32,565
His name is Tamizh.

1661
01:34:32,590 --> 01:34:35,006
I don't know anyone by the name Tamizh.
-Really?

1662
01:34:35,569 --> 01:34:37,361
They said "Tamizh".

1663
01:34:39,495 --> 01:34:41,829
My phone is out of credit.

1664
01:34:42,343 --> 01:34:44,010
Can I use your phone?

1665
01:34:46,569 --> 01:34:47,235
Thank you.

1666
01:34:56,920 --> 01:34:58,671
Actually, I got the name wrong.

1667
01:34:59,078 --> 01:35:00,286
His name is Aravindh.

1668
01:35:01,481 --> 01:35:02,564
Hey, look…

1669
01:35:02,644 --> 01:35:04,311
Aravindh is just my friend.
That's all.

1670
01:35:04,336 --> 01:35:05,460
I don't know anything.

1671
01:35:05,485 --> 01:35:06,652
I'm busy now.

1672
01:35:06,677 --> 01:35:09,302
Daddy has told us not to play
in that room!

1673
01:35:09,423 --> 01:35:11,049
Can't hide there.

1674
01:35:11,388 --> 01:35:13,055
Let's hide elsewhere!

1675
01:35:17,050 --> 01:35:18,468
Can I have some water?

1676
01:36:09,243 --> 01:36:10,577
Come this way!

1677
01:36:12,926 --> 01:36:14,675
They must be hiding
in the other room!

1678
01:36:35,322 --> 01:36:36,905
Why did he give you this money?

1679
01:36:38,508 --> 01:36:42,092
To launder the black money to white.
I just take a commission.

1680
01:36:42,117 --> 01:36:44,159
You've taken the 10 million, alright.

1681
01:36:44,733 --> 01:36:46,817
But the remaining 40 million…

1682
01:36:46,956 --> 01:36:47,872
Is with me.

1683
01:36:53,948 --> 01:36:54,489
No!

1684
01:36:54,514 --> 01:36:55,472
No, no, no…

1685
01:36:55,497 --> 01:36:59,372
I warned you not to
embarrass yourself before your wife.

1686
01:36:59,397 --> 01:37:00,105
You didn't listen!

1687
01:37:00,368 --> 01:37:01,451
And you said…

1688
01:37:01,993 --> 01:37:05,492
Money chooses the worthy.
And my family is not worthy, huh?

1689
01:37:05,730 --> 01:37:08,939
You're my family, too.
Is that why it slipped through your fingers?

1690
01:37:09,812 --> 01:37:11,937
I was born to lose to you?

1691
01:37:12,268 --> 01:37:13,643
Here in Tamizh Nadu...

1692
01:37:13,668 --> 01:37:15,478
The English language may lose,
French may lose.

1693
01:37:15,503 --> 01:37:17,430
Korean may lose,
Japanese may lose.

1694
01:37:17,455 --> 01:37:19,371
Chinese may lose,
Italian may lose.

1695
01:37:19,396 --> 01:37:21,438
Spanish may lose,
German may lose.

1696
01:37:22,730 --> 01:37:26,439
But here in Tamizh Nadu,
Tamizh never loses.

1697
01:37:41,395 --> 01:37:42,812
Lost the 40 million?

1698
01:37:43,634 --> 01:37:48,008
You brought 10 million and lost 40 million!
Why'd you show off so much?

1699
01:37:49,070 --> 01:37:52,320
My ex- boyfriend sounds bright and sunny.

1700
01:37:52,737 --> 01:37:53,946
You sound dull though.

1701
01:37:53,971 --> 01:37:56,679
"Tamizh, the sweetest dialect of all…"

1702
01:37:57,163 --> 01:38:04,412
"Tamizh, this fine Tamizh;
We shall cherish over our lives…"

1703
01:38:12,403 --> 01:38:15,028
I don't need a baby shower now!

1704
01:38:15,695 --> 01:38:18,153
The baby can hear us
talking now.

1705
01:38:18,178 --> 01:38:19,095
Say something.

1706
01:38:23,512 --> 01:38:25,303
Don't trust your family.

1707
01:38:28,083 --> 01:38:29,499
That's what you have to say?

1708
01:38:29,826 --> 01:38:31,076
I only said what I knew.

1709
01:38:44,453 --> 01:38:45,786
I'm leaving, then.
Bye, auntie!

1710
01:38:46,032 --> 01:38:46,865
See you, Yamuna.

1711
01:38:46,890 --> 01:38:48,764
Why? It's so late.

1712
01:38:48,789 --> 01:38:49,789
Stay over and leave in the morning.

1713
01:38:49,981 --> 01:38:52,273
No, auntie!
I'll come back later.

1714
01:38:52,298 --> 01:38:53,006
Okay!

1715
01:38:53,210 --> 01:38:54,711
This place is not
even comfortable enough.

1716
01:38:54,760 --> 01:38:55,427
It's fine.

1717
01:38:55,750 --> 01:38:57,416
No such thing!

1718
01:38:57,593 --> 01:38:58,260
Stay over?

1719
01:38:58,364 --> 01:38:59,947
I could use the company, too.

1720
01:39:03,235 --> 01:39:04,276
Okay, I'll stay.

1721
01:39:23,935 --> 01:39:26,477
You can't sleep here!
There are mosquitoes here.

1722
01:39:27,262 --> 01:39:29,262
Your girlfriend is comfortable inside.

1723
01:39:29,382 --> 01:39:30,549
Don't worry.
-Come on!

1724
01:39:30,935 --> 01:39:31,644
That's silly.

1725
01:39:31,775 --> 01:39:32,650
I saw it.

1726
01:39:32,675 --> 01:39:34,924
I saw you prepping her bed
with so much care!

1727
01:39:36,152 --> 01:39:38,776
One must be hospitable to guests, right?

1728
01:39:42,962 --> 01:39:43,795
Look at me.

1729
01:39:45,583 --> 01:39:46,666
Look into my eyes.

1730
01:39:49,239 --> 01:39:52,821
Don't you still have feelings for her?

1731
01:39:52,846 --> 01:39:54,013
You're crazy!

1732
01:39:55,198 --> 01:39:56,532
So you haven't refused.

1733
01:39:58,788 --> 01:40:00,247
I'm only in love with you.

1734
01:40:00,768 --> 01:40:02,185
Yeah, right.

1735
01:40:06,466 --> 01:40:07,341
I love you, wifey.

1736
01:40:07,366 --> 01:40:08,700
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1737
01:40:09,673 --> 01:40:10,798
Hearing it for the first time.

1738
01:40:10,823 --> 01:40:12,531
And I'm yet to hear it even once.

1739
01:40:12,556 --> 01:40:14,261
Fine, I love you.

1740
01:40:14,286 --> 01:40:16,036
Wow, so romantic!

1741
01:41:13,382 --> 01:41:14,299
Where's my food?

1742
01:41:15,532 --> 01:41:17,282
Why would you do this?

1743
01:41:17,307 --> 01:41:20,307
You're talking to yourself
like a madman!

1744
01:41:20,332 --> 01:41:23,499
Know why I haven't told your mum
about this?

1745
01:41:24,413 --> 01:41:28,413
If she knew you killed her brother…

1746
01:41:34,871 --> 01:41:36,913
Money can make you a rich.

1747
01:41:36,938 --> 01:41:39,271
But it can also drive you crazy.

1748
01:41:39,624 --> 01:41:41,541
Money can make you a rich.

1749
01:41:41,735 --> 01:41:44,068
But it can also drive you crazy.

1750
01:41:44,863 --> 01:41:45,780
So, buddy…

1751
01:41:46,167 --> 01:41:48,209
Can't tell the truth and lies apart?

1752
01:41:49,038 --> 01:41:51,580
Everyone thinks you're crazy?

1753
01:41:51,605 --> 01:41:53,730
Heard you've been talking to yourself.

1754
01:41:54,124 --> 01:41:56,582
You had better see a good psychiatrist, man.

1755
01:42:23,360 --> 01:42:23,860
Uncle!

1756
01:42:24,902 --> 01:42:26,360
Why did you do this?

1757
01:42:27,185 --> 01:42:29,269
What did I ever do to you?

1758
01:42:29,294 --> 01:42:32,044
You've brought my family to the streets!

1759
01:42:33,709 --> 01:42:36,209
Why are you so greedy for money?

1760
01:42:36,234 --> 01:42:38,067
You got me killed!

1761
01:42:39,796 --> 01:42:40,338
Come on.

1762
01:42:40,363 --> 01:42:41,487
Come, join me!

1763
01:42:41,870 --> 01:42:42,745
Come to me!

1764
01:42:42,786 --> 01:42:44,953
Uncle!
-Come to me!

1765
01:43:04,891 --> 01:43:05,684
Tamizh!

1766
01:43:33,552 --> 01:43:34,594
Why are you doing this?

1767
01:43:36,435 --> 01:43:38,769
We were so happy. So peaceful.

1768
01:43:39,928 --> 01:43:41,470
Did we have money then?

1769
01:43:42,928 --> 01:43:45,678
I had you, you had me.
We had everybody.

1770
01:43:46,925 --> 01:43:48,217
You've got nobody now.

1771
01:43:50,157 --> 01:43:52,282
Why do you love money
more than all of us?

1772
01:43:55,569 --> 01:43:59,818
I'm not trying to snatch that money
for my benefit, man.

1773
01:44:00,467 --> 01:44:04,176
I must return this money to the officer
and prove my dad's innocence!

1774
01:44:04,608 --> 01:44:05,316
That's all.

1775
01:44:09,893 --> 01:44:14,560
But if you're losing your mind,
your life and happiness over it…

1776
01:44:18,162 --> 01:44:19,078
I don't want it.

1777
01:44:21,352 --> 01:44:23,435
It won't bring my father back.

1778
01:44:30,009 --> 01:44:32,133
I'll give you the rest of the money.

1779
01:44:32,805 --> 01:44:33,680
You keep it.

1780
01:44:36,147 --> 01:44:36,731
I'm off.

1781
01:44:46,677 --> 01:44:47,219
Auntie…

1782
01:44:47,244 --> 01:44:48,244
Forgive me!

1783
01:44:48,895 --> 01:44:50,895
I was greedy for money.

1784
01:44:51,422 --> 01:44:53,505
I didn't think uncle would commit suicide.

1785
01:44:53,962 --> 01:44:56,962
I just wanted to use the money
for business and return it.

1786
01:44:57,186 --> 01:45:00,186
But when uncle died,
I didn't know what to say!

1787
01:45:01,583 --> 01:45:02,583
Forgive me, auntie.

1788
01:45:04,972 --> 01:45:05,514
Dude…

1789
01:45:05,653 --> 01:45:07,404
I'm so ashamed to face you.

1790
01:45:07,878 --> 01:45:08,795
Forgive me!

1791
01:45:09,215 --> 01:45:10,048
I'm sorry.

1792
01:45:10,887 --> 01:45:14,220
It all seemed right at the time.
But I was wrong.

1793
01:45:14,630 --> 01:45:16,463
I was wrong.
I'm sorry!

1794
01:45:17,309 --> 01:45:17,934
I'm sorry!

1795
01:45:19,935 --> 01:45:20,602
Come in.

1796
01:45:23,071 --> 01:45:24,071
Oh, Tamizh!

1797
01:45:24,357 --> 01:45:25,648
Come in.
Have a seat.

1798
01:45:26,001 --> 01:45:27,959
I've got the missing 50 million.

1799
01:45:29,341 --> 01:45:31,883
Please announce that the file
has been found.

1800
01:45:32,256 --> 01:45:33,630
And give me back my job, sir.

1801
01:45:34,290 --> 01:45:36,664
I'll come over to your place
in the evening and drop off the money.

1802
01:45:38,516 --> 01:45:39,184
See...

1803
01:45:40,272 --> 01:45:41,481
Let's make a deal.

1804
01:45:42,680 --> 01:45:44,221
You can keep the 50 million.

1805
01:45:45,280 --> 01:45:48,280
I've made 500 million with the missing file.

1806
01:45:48,305 --> 01:45:53,221
I can't account for this file now.
Nor can I give you back your job.

1807
01:45:53,333 --> 01:45:55,874
Instead, keep this 50 million.

1808
01:45:56,329 --> 01:45:59,787
You can settle down.
And I can put an end to this.

1809
01:46:00,510 --> 01:46:01,635
Don't think too hard.

1810
01:46:02,077 --> 01:46:04,660
Even if you slog all your life,
you can't even make 10 million.

1811
01:46:04,870 --> 01:46:06,912
You'll never get so lucky again.

1812
01:46:06,937 --> 01:46:08,853
Why did you send those men
to get the money, then?

1813
01:46:08,878 --> 01:46:11,211
So that you wouldn't walk in here
with the money.

1814
01:46:11,649 --> 01:46:13,940
I'd have to answer to you!

1815
01:46:15,028 --> 01:46:15,778
What say?

1816
01:46:16,933 --> 01:46:21,016
You can settle down.
And I'll be relieved of these issues.

1817
01:46:22,056 --> 01:46:24,472
You're putting a price tag of 50 million
for my dad's life?

1818
01:46:25,500 --> 01:46:28,250
Not everyone is after money.
-Why not?

1819
01:46:28,573 --> 01:46:29,907
What's greater than money?

1820
01:46:33,208 --> 01:46:36,667
The file shall be back by morning.
And my job, too.

1821
01:46:37,131 --> 01:46:39,089
Or else…
-Or what?

1822
01:46:39,670 --> 01:46:41,086
You can't do a thing to me.

1823
01:46:41,361 --> 01:46:43,028
But I can destroy you.

1824
01:46:44,659 --> 01:46:46,368
No one can destroy Tamizh.

1825
01:46:46,712 --> 01:46:47,628
Try your best.

1826
01:46:55,528 --> 01:46:57,277
Did he just refuse 50 million?

1827
01:46:58,063 --> 01:46:59,104
He won't budge.

1828
01:46:59,238 --> 01:47:00,655
He needs the violent treatment.

1829
01:47:05,234 --> 01:47:07,234
Hello?
-My contractions have begun.

1830
01:47:07,552 --> 01:47:09,510
And mother's gone out to the temple…
-I'm coming!

1831
01:47:27,024 --> 01:47:27,774
No…

1832
01:47:27,816 --> 01:47:28,608
No!

1833
01:47:30,635 --> 01:47:32,136
Don't hit him. Please!

1834
01:47:36,442 --> 01:47:37,109
Help!

1835
01:47:37,662 --> 01:47:38,912
Somebody, help!

1836
01:50:04,034 --> 01:50:07,243
You should have agreed to my terms.
You've made a mistake.

1837
01:50:07,268 --> 01:50:07,936
Son...

1838
01:50:08,811 --> 01:50:11,937
I shouldn't have let you go yesterday.
But you got away.

1839
01:50:12,496 --> 01:50:14,496
You can't get away from me.

1840
01:50:14,521 --> 01:50:16,978
I'm not going anywhere.
I'll be waiting.

1841
01:50:17,232 --> 01:50:18,399
But you're going to the prison.

1842
01:50:19,232 --> 01:50:21,191
You've got nothing
to send me to the prison.

1843
01:50:21,288 --> 01:50:23,955
Could you please turn on your T.V
and tune into the news?

1844
01:50:26,743 --> 01:50:27,451
Yes, sir.

1845
01:50:28,075 --> 01:50:29,159
I'll say it like it is.

1846
01:50:29,184 --> 01:50:30,767
My conscience is killing me.

1847
01:50:31,201 --> 01:50:33,284
A senior officer of mine, Mr. Prakash Kumar…

1848
01:50:33,681 --> 01:50:38,556
Falsely accused Mr. Vijayraghavan
of stealing Devanathan's file.

1849
01:50:38,847 --> 01:50:41,931
Unable to handle the accusation,
he committed suicide.

1850
01:50:42,447 --> 01:50:43,822
It worked in Mr. Prakash's favour.

1851
01:50:45,171 --> 01:50:46,547
Have you got evidence?

1852
01:50:46,636 --> 01:50:47,760
Evidence?

1853
01:50:48,009 --> 01:50:49,592
I was an aide to everything.

1854
01:50:49,770 --> 01:50:50,812
I'm an eye-witness.

1855
01:50:57,817 --> 01:50:59,817
Wondering how I pulled him
to my side?

1856
01:51:00,300 --> 01:51:01,425
Money.

1857
01:51:01,831 --> 01:51:03,374
I beat you at your own game.

1858
01:51:04,045 --> 01:51:07,211
I bribed him your 50 million
to make him confess.

1859
01:51:07,736 --> 01:51:08,611
Your money…

1860
01:51:09,075 --> 01:51:10,908
Turned out to be your devil.

1861
01:51:11,506 --> 01:51:13,341
Much money is much trouble.

1862
01:51:14,378 --> 01:51:15,087
Goodbye!

1863
01:51:23,232 --> 01:51:23,857
Fool!

1864
01:51:23,882 --> 01:51:25,090
Why did you tell the press?

1865
01:51:25,115 --> 01:51:26,699
You're going to prison with me.

1866
01:51:26,787 --> 01:51:30,078
Sir, you looted 500 million
and threw me some 500 thousand.

1867
01:51:30,134 --> 01:51:31,759
The boy has paid me 50 million now.

1868
01:51:32,032 --> 01:51:35,573
If I continue to be your side-kick
for the rest of my life, I won't make so much!

1869
01:52:08,273 --> 01:52:08,815
Bye!

1870
01:52:16,122 --> 01:52:16,830
Wait!

1871
01:52:17,584 --> 01:52:18,833
Wait up!

1872
01:52:25,999 --> 01:52:27,166
You forgot your lunch.

1873
01:52:28,891 --> 01:52:29,516
Thanks.

1874
01:52:30,367 --> 01:52:30,992
Hello!

1875
01:52:31,959 --> 01:52:34,001
What?
-Won't you carry me home?

1876
01:52:34,471 --> 01:52:36,263
You were pregnant then!

1877
01:52:36,288 --> 01:52:38,101
If I carry you now,
what would people think?

1878
01:52:38,126 --> 01:52:39,084
Walk back, okay?

1879
01:52:47,155 --> 01:52:48,612
Really forgot your lunch, huh?

1880
01:52:48,637 --> 01:52:50,929
Nope. You were holding the box.
Why didn't you give it?

1881
01:52:51,610 --> 01:52:54,360
Won't this old lady think
we are disgusting?

1882
01:52:54,385 --> 01:52:56,301
But I can't carry her!
