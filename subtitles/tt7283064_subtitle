1
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,920
MY LORD EMMANUEL!

2
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:30,420
I've travelled length & breadth of this country.

3
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:34,000
and I have seen neither a beggar nor a thief.

4
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:37,750
We observed that this country has great wealth.

5
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,500
We are the people who believe that
we are the most civlized people

6
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:44,370
but Indians are who start the civilization.

7
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:52,620
civilization lies in the roots of Indian culture.

8
00:03:54,710 --> 00:04:05,540
The Mughals who ruled them for hundreds of years...
have looted their treasure but not their culture.

9
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:11,250
Their strength lies in their education and culture.

10
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:14,670
Break it and looting India would become easier.

11
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:21,420
Divide and rule and destroying systems had been initiated from then itself.

12
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:30,290
Few rulers, Palegars have started revolting against the British for freedom.

13
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:36,330
Amongst them, the first Independence revolt that we know of is...

14
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:42,120
Sepoy Mutiny of 1857.
And the principal leader in that revolt is Jhansi Lakshmi Bai.

15
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:10,670
It’s 3 months since we have begun this freedom struggle
under the leadership of Jhansi Lakshmi Bai,

16
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:13,710
We started with 20000 men.

17
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:16,870
Now only 100 of us are left.

18
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:20,670
Our fate will be the same if we enter
into the battle field tomorrow

19
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:27,330
We’ve initiated this Freedom Struggle, let us end it.

20
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,710
Hara Hara Mahadev!!!

21
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:43,870
Hara Hara Mahadev!!!

22
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:48,250
Even if a warrior’s head gets cut, he shouldn’t drop his weapon.

23
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:52,540
Commander, a person ending his life in war is equal to ‘Lord Shiva’.

24
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:57,420
Who gave you the right to stop this struggle?

25
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:03,080
This isn’t initiated by you or me.

26
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,120
You are afraid to fight as we are only 100 men.

27
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:14,290
10 years back, a single man has begun this war even before us.

28
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:23,250
The British Empire got shook by a single person.

29
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,040
It's a boy child!

30
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:33,750
Father, but he's born dead.

31
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:37,620
His birth itself had a war in it.

32
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:40,960
That war has won death even before it was born.

33
00:06:56,370 --> 00:07:00,120
He's born killing the death, Sir.
He is Immortal.

34
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:03,080
He is a monk.

35
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:05,210
He’s a warrior.

36
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:10,080
He’s the one who has ignited the
spirit of freedom, the sun of Renadu.

37
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:40,420
Nossam Paleygar (Chief) Jayarami Reddy had both of
his daughters married to Uyyalawada Paleygar Majjari Malla Reddy.

38
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:50,710
Elder daughter gave birth to 2 boys and younger daughter to a boy
whom they realized was a ‘chosen’ one when he was 6years old.

39
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:53,580
Seema was facing drought then.

40
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,080
Yagnam needs to be performed for rainfall.

41
00:07:56,420 --> 00:08:01,670
Only a person from Majjari lineage who lits the diya
on Jagannatha hill can perform the Yagnam.

42
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:06,540
As per the astrology, Narasimha Reddy
was chosen to be the eligible person.

43
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:11,330
On every Karthika Pournami,
Narasimha Reddy has to lighten up the diya.

44
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:18,960
People from the surrounding hundreds of villages believe
that the Diya shows path to a bright future.

45
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:24,670
Narasimha Reddy was adopted by his
grandfather who had no successor to his Nossam fort.

46
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:47,870
Grandpa, why were they killed?

47
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:51,750
It's the British rule, My son.

48
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:56,750
If we confront or oppose them, they'd kill us.

49
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:59,290
You're feudal chiefs, right? Can't you do anything?

50
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:00,870
We are feudal chiefs just for namesake.

51
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:06,170
These British entered our country,
took away our power and started looting the public

52
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:11,080
For fearing their guns and for giving up our powers...

53
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:15,500
they've started throwing a small pension on us,
for which we got habituated...

54
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:20,830
and from then have been living miserably like slaves.

55
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:28,080
Instead of living like a slave,
it's better we die opposing them.

56
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:40,250
Gosayi Venkanna a legendary saint having expertise in
all life sciences and martial arts had become the Guru.

57
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:42,290
It seems you went all around the nation.

58
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,370
Yes.

59
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:46,330
Are these Brits killing all of us,
the same way throughout the nation?

60
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:48,460
Yes, they are killing

61
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:50,290
Then we should kill the British, right?

62
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:51,370
Oh, Narasimha!

63
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:52,500
They need to be killed.

64
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:54,500
Then bless me.

65
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:56,580
I'll go and kill them all.

66
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,460
How many can you kill alone?

67
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,250
I can kill ten of them

68
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,120
They are an army of thousands.

69
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,040
They won't spare you alive, they'd kill you

70
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,210
Then I'll die

71
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,420
Killing or dying is not Important.

72
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,080
Winning is important.

73
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,420
To win, a war must be fought

74
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:30,460
You alone cannot acheive that.

75
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:33,330
People around you should also come along with you.

76
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:40,750
For that to happen,
the rage inside you should be ignited in others too.

77
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:45,080
You yourself have to transform into a war.

78
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:52,250
That isn't your weapon

79
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:56,620
This is your weapon.

80
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:06,000
Om...

81
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:11,750
Narasimha...

82
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,540
first, you need to win yourself.

83
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:36,340
Let’s begin implementing British rules
through East India in small areas at first...

84
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:41,380
then gradually as time passes throughout the whole of India itself.

85
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:44,300
Increase the present taxes by 300%.

86
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:50,260
In such way British have invaded into India.

87
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:58,880
High ranking officials were put in positions of power,
so they could exploit the wealth of India.

88
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:10,470
Cochrane, the representative of this evil herd of raiders.

89
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:15,970
Started heading to the Southern India
known to be the nucleus of the Indian Subcontinent.

90
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:29,470
But he's not aware of the existence of a valorous land Renadu
And that Renadu's Sun has already risen penetrating the darkness.

91
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:35,050
Many years ago, that land was divided into 61 small dominions.

92
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:38,880
The chiefs to those dominions were called 'Palegars'.

93
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:44,800
The Palegars have lost their power and unity because of the British.

94
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,340
Avuku's chief Avuku Raju.

95
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:49,840
Mydukuru's chief Veera Reddy.

96
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,760
Kurnool's Papa khan...

97
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:56,680
Like all the 61 total of Chiefs
ruling their dominions Independently...

98
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:03,880
In effort to unite them all, Nossam paleygar
Uyyalwada Narasimhareddy is organising this Ceremony.

99
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:17,760
Swamy, my son is organising this
ceremony against the wishes of the British.

100
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,180
Will he succeed?

101
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:24,430
Narasimha Reddy isn't a common person.
He's the chosen one.

102
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:32,550
He was raised with sword in one hand and the vedas in another.

103
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,970
No force can stop him.

104
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:11,130
People are waiting for your dance performance
Come quickly.

105
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:46,550
What happened, dear?

106
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:49,970
Swami... underneath that water..??

107
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:51,590
Oh...!

108
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:56,840
Before the ceremony begins, it's our tradition
to pray Lord Sangameswara residing in the pond.

109
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:00,590
But how...? How can he be in there for so long?

110
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:03,130
He's the great man who mastered the art of holding his breath in water.

111
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:06,840
Nossam paleygar
Uyyalawada Narasimha Reddy.

112
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:47,010
Papa Khan, It's been so long since we celebrated this God
for with the sacred clothes you've brought.

113
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:53,550
These celebrations which were stopped by the British, have been
restarted because of the bravery of my brother Narasimha Reddy.

114
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,680
Oh, God!

115
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:59,590
These celebrations should go on grandly without any obstacles.

116
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:01,090
Pray to God.

117
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:08,380
I won't let that happen

118
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:13,470
What Avuku Raju?! arrangements for this competition
have been done with utmost importance .

119
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:15,590
Everyone have come to watch this competition.

120
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,090
How can you say this competition won't happen?

121
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:20,800
Who's organising these celebrations?
- Narasimha Reddy

122
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:24,840
We too have a part in the
arrangements of these celebrations, right?

123
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:27,470
But still, they'd say it is Narasimha Reddy

124
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:32,050
Ok, who'll win the competition?

125
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:34,090
They are saying it will be Narasimha Reddy

126
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,300
What if we win?

127
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:40,470
They'd praise Narasimha Reddy again for organising
the competition unbiasedly.

128
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:44,630
Basi Reddy, should this competition occur?
as he is going to be praised irrespective of the winner.

129
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,760
No

130
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:49,590
They won't... Look at your man there

131
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:54,340
That's a drug which triggers madness of the bulls.

132
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:07,300
Now neither Narasimha Reddy nor Lord Narasimha
can make this competition happen.

133
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:16,880
Bulli Reddy, drug the bulls a bit more. Not just this competition,
but even these celebrations shouldn't take place.

134
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:24,340
Lakshmi, you...

135
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:31,050
who are you searching for?

136
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:31,430
Bulls are heading into the valley.

137
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,470
We found out because one of our men saw him
drugging the bulls...

138
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:09,720
Ok, past is past. Nothing happened, right?

139
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,550
Come on, nothing went wrong.

140
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:15,010
Avuku Raju is a fellow chief like us...

141
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,220
Leave it guys, come on move...

142
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:20,300
Those two families have been locking horns since ages

143
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,430
All of us are aware of that Right!..
Move on..

144
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:22,380
Wait

145
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:28,970
He is not the only chief here.

146
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:32,880
We are the 61 chiefs in total even the public are here.

147
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,550
Celebrations belong to all, Basi Reddy

148
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:38,630
King or the common man are equal before the justice.

149
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:41,430
Avuku Raju should apologise.

150
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:49,220
Why don't you all speak up?
My dad is speaking the truth, right?

151
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:52,430
He should apologise
- Yes, he should apologise.

152
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,010
Yes, he should apologise.

153
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,880
A Feudal chief asking for an apology?

154
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:04,680
I will cut my head off...

155
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:09,050
but I won't ask for an apology.

156
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:10,180
Avuku Raju

157
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:11,010
Papa Khan.

158
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:15,300
Avuku Raju might have committed a mistake now...

159
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,300
But, he is the chief of 70 villages.

160
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:24,180
It’s true that he hates me and it’s also true that
the same hatred is the reason for this damage.

161
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:27,010
But he loves his people.

162
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:31,630
Let's remember his people, his good deeds and forgive him.

163
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,220
Narasimha Reddy...

164
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:53,300
I don't like you seeing the goodness in me.

165
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:59,510
This isn't jealous but self-respect, Narasimha Reddy

166
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:04,970
I too will have a day, Narasimha Reddy

167
00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:11,970
That day, you'll be in the position to ask for an apology
and I'll be in the position to forgive you.

168
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:22,510
There is valour in this land.
That exists both in you and me.

169
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:28,630
Show your valour not for hatred but for the nation

170
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:35,130
Then, I would not only bow my head before you,
if needed will have my head chopped too.

171
00:23:56,300 --> 00:24:00,380
♫ See this, Narasimmaa... ♫

172
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:04,090
♫See the crowd that has gathered for you... ♫

173
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:09,050
♫Listen to this, Narasimma... ♫

174
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:13,010
♫ Listen to our hearts beating your name aloud. ♫

175
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:19,220

176
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:22,760

177
00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:49,680
♫ Is the sky our drum today?♫

178
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:54,130
♫ Is the ground our stage today? ♫

179
00:24:55,220 --> 00:25:00,050
♫ Is the universe filled with laughter??
Is the heart filled with fragrance?♫

180
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:04,260
♫ This is the nation that scattered drum
beats in all directions ♫

181

185

♫ Did the king become our guard

186
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:32,510
♫ Did that God come here
to live with us as a friend?♫

187
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:37,090
♫ Did the king become our guard

188
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:42,300
♫Did the king become our guard

189
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:46,840
♫ Did the king become our guard

190
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:10,840
♫ You all are the life in my body.♫

191
00:26:11,050 --> 00:26:15,380

♫ I shall live in your joy. ♫

193
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:25,180
♫ Even when I am gone,
I shall live in your joy forever♫

194
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:33,630
♫ To talk about my beautiful yesterdays,
elders’ eyes would stand witness ♫

195
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:38,050
♫Happy tears will testify
the essence of my entire life. ♫

196
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:43,220
♫To talk about the bright tomorrow
little ones’ eyes would stand witness. ♫

197
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:47,510
♫The future will glitter in glory in their little eyes. ♫

198
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,970
♫ Did that God come here
to live with us as a friend?♫

199
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:25,010
♫ Did the king become our guard
to protect our motherland? ♫

200
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:29,090
♫ Did that God come here
to live with us as a friend?♫

201
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:33,680
♫ Did the king become our guard
to protect our motherland? ♫

202
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:38,680
♫Did the king become our guard
to protect our motherland? ♫

203
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:42,430
♫ Did the king become our guard
to protect our motherland? ♫

204
00:27:57,090 --> 00:28:00,720
Your Narasimha Reddy is going
against the Brits.

205
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,800
Now Narasimha Reddy has organised festival
even after we said NO!

206
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:05,180
We can't bear him any more.

207
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:07,760
So I've written a letter to Madras.

208
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:09,380
Now they'll take care of him.

209
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:11,340
He did all of this, so that the news reaches Madras.

210
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,970
The real festival is yet to begin.

211
00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:46,260
Wonderful.

212
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:51,800
I know that.

213
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:53,260
Madam Lakshmi...

214
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:58,340
why not try something new with this
dancing skill to be useful for the people?

215
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:05,220
This Lakshmi dances only for God and
sings only in front of God and not for humans like you.

216
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:08,220
Even that God is for the people, right?

217
00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:13,930
Just try changing it to a form which inspires people
to confront the evil and spread goodness .

218
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:15,800
Then your art will have true meaning.

219
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:40,070
Are you still thinking about him...?

220
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,480
I'm afraid that I might not come out of his thoughts.

221
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:58,940
[Screaming]

222
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,360
[Screaming]

223
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,270
Come with me, quickly!

224
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:50,900
Come fast.

225
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:51,980
Careful.

226
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:00,610
Get them out

227
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:02,480
Come... come quickly!

228
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,360
Someone did this on purpose. Who did this?

229
00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:15,690
Who did it?

230
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:17,610
I did it, Sir

231
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:24,730
I did it.

232
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:27,770
You burnt your own house where you light the lamp?

233
00:31:27,770 --> 00:31:29,020
What can I do, Sir?

234
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,190
We lived like Kings once upon a time.

235
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:36,320
Brits have arrived and this land got cursed with them.

236
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:41,190
On top of that there isn't even
a drop of rain from the past two years

237
00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:48,730
We get only half the crop in the drought
and the British took away half of that as taxes.

238
00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:55,400
All this time, I have been starving and feeding my kids.

239
00:31:56,520 --> 00:32:01,980
but now my son has gone to the extent of stealing food.

240
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:09,360
What a shame it is to steal food...!

241
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:17,190
I couldn't bear seeing the same hands that
once were philanthropic deeds, reduced to stealing food.

242
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:24,270
I felt it was better to die than to live with lost prestige.

243
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:33,940
Are you hungry..?

244
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:36,940
Mother has been feeding us while she starves.

245
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:40,440
I saw food in the neighbour‚Äôs house
and brought that for mom.

246
00:32:40,770 --> 00:32:42,110
Is that wrong?

247
00:32:56,690 --> 00:32:57,480
Brother!

248
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:02,730
Get all the grain stock in the godowns of Uyyalawada
and Nossam forts on to the carts.

249
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:06,520
No one on this Renadu land should sleep starving.

250
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:09,150
Distribute it.

251
00:33:10,570 --> 00:33:11,570
Ok brother.

252
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:18,940
It's wrong to steal.

253
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:20,440
What's stealing?

254
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:24,900
We shouldn't touch anything that doesn't belong to us.

255
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:26,070
What if it is ours?

256
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:30,820
It's our Right and we shouldn't let that go.

257
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:37,860
Reddy Sir, did you call me?

258
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:41,360
I've already sent the pension for this month.

259
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:49,610
Raghavachary, our people paid
taxes as long as they had good harvest, right?

260
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,820
As they are good people... They've paid it Sir.

261
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:56,070
Now, tell your bosses that they
won't pay taxes until the drought ends.

262
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:57,820
Sir..!

263
00:33:58,690 --> 00:34:01,400
Tell them, they won't even pay the next year.

264
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:03,270
What Sir?

265
00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:10,690
If they object, tell them we'd plow our lands
with their backbones and then pay the taxes.

266
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:13,860
That could be dangerous...
-Let it come.

267
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:17,270
I've been waiting for that.

268
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:23,320
Ok.

269
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:28,400
Untill the drought ends, no one needs to pay taxes to the British.

270
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:29,860
Heyy!!

271
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:33,610
Send these carts back to Narasimha Reddy.

272
00:34:33,610 --> 00:34:36,190
Distribute my own grain stock to our people!

273
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:37,150
Thank you, Sir.

274
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:43,520
I can't ask my people to stop paying taxes
and defy the British like Narasimha Reddy!

275
00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:46,730
I too can't go against them!

276
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:47,770
Is that the decision of everyone?

277
00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:51,320
Veera Reddy, a Palegar shouldn't interfere in another Palegar's dominion.

278
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:56,150
Let's move father, we have our dominion to rule.
We shall follow Narasimha Reddy's path.

279
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:24,070
Our Madras presidency's one year tax collection
is enough to feed entire London for 25 years.

280
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:28,320
Why are the taxes from Dattamandalam so low?

281
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:33,110
Right from the beginning,
it's been tough collecting taxes there.

282
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:35,020
Reason...

283
00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:37,650
Greatness of Renadu land, Sir

284
00:35:37,730 --> 00:35:41,190
Even a rabbit born there chases a tiger.

285
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:48,110
Unable to deal with the people and chiefs there;

286
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:52,860
Nizam has gifted us that land and
therefore it's called Dattamanadalam.

287
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:56,070
That land is full of droughts,
and they don't heed to anyone.

288
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:58,190
They'd pay taxes... but only as much as they like

289
00:35:58,190 --> 00:36:02,320
Then kill them and bring taxes.
- Then they would kill us

290
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:09,400
Even though Thomas Munro's ryotwari act took away their powers,
people there still look up to their chiefs.

291
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:12,520
Even our men also fear them.

292
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,690
Tell me in one sentence.

293
00:36:14,770 --> 00:36:16,570
Uyyalawada Narasimha Reddy.

294
00:36:17,570 --> 00:36:19,190
He's their courage, Sir

295
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:21,480
Did you see him?
- No.

296
00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:23,440
But I have heard many stories, Sir.

297
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,860
I heard, he killed a Cheetah at the age of ten
and carried it on his shoulders.

298
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:32,820
You Indians are all bloody barbarians, Madhavayyar.

299
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:35,400
You are only good at believing myths.

300
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,610
That area doesn't need a Collector.

301
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,110
But a hunter!

302
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:51,070
Whites are the masters and blacks are the slaves

303
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:55,980
For these Banaras fabrics from the past six months..

304
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:58,070
The Victoria ship is waiting.

305
00:36:58,070 --> 00:37:00,110
Sir, we really are short of colours

306
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:01,480
I'll give you colour.

307
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,110
This marriage is a festival.

308
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:22,610
A Love festival being celebrated with
Hindus and Muslims coming together.

309
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:25,440
Welcome!

310
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:46,360
If I knew you were coming to this marriage,
I wouldn't have come.

311
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:49,480
I came here because I knew you would be here
for your relative's marriage.

312
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:51,860
To share my feelings...

313
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:55,360
I lost my parents at a small age.

314
00:37:55,730 --> 00:37:57,860
I lost everyone who were close to me.

315
00:37:58,070 --> 00:38:02,270
Anything I like has the habit of moving away from me.

316
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:07,440
From then I've started believing God and
have been serving him with my dance.

317
00:38:08,610 --> 00:38:09,940
I've seen you...

318
00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:13,150
you are a great soul...

319
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:18,570
Don't try getting close to me, I'll lose you too.

320
00:38:22,690 --> 00:38:26,440
Even if you move away from me,
my love will still be with you.

321
00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:31,900
Tell me, just like Bhagyanagaram here,
was built for Bhagamathi...

322
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:37,770
shall I build a city named
Veera Venkata Mahalakshmi Nagaram in your name.

323
00:38:38,270 --> 00:38:39,070
Tell me, Lakshmi.

324
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:45,190
Just fix my name Lakshmi next to Narasimha, that's all.

325
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:10,400
Swamy, I've sent the message to Nossam fort.

326
00:39:10,610 --> 00:39:12,150
Narasimha Reddy isn't there either...

327
00:39:12,770 --> 00:39:16,150
Today is full moon day of Karthika month
and he should light the lamp over the hill.

328
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,690
I'm not sure if he remembers it.

329
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:23,480
He's been lighting the lamp on every
full moon day of Karthika Month...

330
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:25,610
He will light it today as well.

331
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:43,650
The right time has arrived.
Narasimha Reddy needs to know the truth.

332
00:39:45,270 --> 00:39:47,730
Get everything ready for Yagna, tomorrow.

333
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:05,360
Obanna, What's all this pomp for?
- Some Yagnam., Even Guruji has also come..

334
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:12,820
Salutations to the Guruji.
-'May you live long'

335
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:15,690
There's a drought in Seema.

336
00:40:15,690 --> 00:40:18,570
Yagna needs to be performed to have rainfall.
And that to be you should do.

337
00:40:18,770 --> 00:40:20,520
As you say, Guruji.
- Get ready.

338
00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:23,190
Narasimha
- Mother.

339
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:24,980
Wear these clothes and come.
- Ok

340
00:40:25,610 --> 00:40:26,400
You tell him...

341
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,400
No... you tell it sister

342
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,070
You tell him...
- Mother

343
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:32,480
But unmarried shouldn't perform Yagna, right?

344
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:33,190
Yes...

345
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:34,650
Then how can I...

346
00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:36,570
You already got married in your childhood.

347
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:41,110
You are married to Siddhamma, at the age of 6.

348
00:40:48,770 --> 00:40:51,650
Seema faced a similar drought in your childhood.

349
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:54,360
As per the Astrology,
only you were eligible to perform the Yagna...

350
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:58,900
In an unavoidable situation, we got you married
with Siddhamma and had you do the Yagna.

351
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:12,110
We got you married for the sake of Yagnam but later
the astrology pointed that you had a Dosha(fault)

352
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:18,190
It stated that your life would be in danger
if you and your wife meet each other for 24 years.

353
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,730
So we had to separate both of you.

354
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:28,820
Your Dosha period has ended now and coincidentally
the need to perform Yagna has arised again.

355
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:33,690
Your marriage with Siddhamma is God's decision

356
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:34,770
Go!

357
00:41:35,610 --> 00:41:36,360
Get ready...

358
00:41:37,770 --> 00:41:41,650
To wipe the tears of the people,
perform Yagna with Siddhamma.

359
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:42,610
Go..

360
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:18,360
[Chants]

361
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:34,230
Lakshmi...

362
00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:39,190
Why should you be punished for this?

363
00:44:39,190 --> 00:44:42,400
I've broke my word; Punish me!!!

364
00:44:45,980 --> 00:44:47,650
I don't have the strength to bear it.

365
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:53,270
Why should this happen only to me?

366
00:44:56,070 --> 00:44:58,150
Our parents are anyway chosen by the God,

367
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:02,690
I had hoped at least to choose my own husband.

368
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:06,400
Now it looks like, even that isn't possible.

369
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:10,110
Let me at least decide my death.

370
00:45:11,070 --> 00:45:12,190
You don't have the right!

371
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:17,570
God blesses only few people with an art form.

372
00:45:18,270 --> 00:45:21,230
He has blessed you with a great art that can inspire people.

373
00:45:21,730 --> 00:45:26,230
This art isn't for you or for that God
It's for all those people who get inspired from it...

374
00:45:28,270 --> 00:45:30,320
You don't have the right to give up abruptly

375
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:37,230
After we die and stand before the God;
we should be able to look confidently into his eyes.

376
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:42,230
We should proudly say that I have lived
every minute with completeness.

377
00:45:44,150 --> 00:45:46,440
Every life should have a purpose.

378
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:49,270
Every death should lead to an another life on this land.

379
00:45:54,150 --> 00:45:58,150
When we find out the reason why we are born,
only then we can know the purpose we can die for.

380
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:53,770
I want to share a lot of things with you. Can I?

381
00:46:55,770 --> 00:46:58,900
You didn't want this marriage, right?

382
00:46:59,690 --> 00:47:03,900
This marriage took place at young age .
liking and disliking doesn't it matter.

383
00:47:10,730 --> 00:47:17,860
Yes, I agree but I grew up from childhood liking only you.

384
00:47:21,070 --> 00:47:23,770
Were you already aware that we were married?

385
00:47:23,820 --> 00:47:26,320
Of course, they informed me in my childhood itself.

386
00:47:28,610 --> 00:47:31,400
You have been my world ever since I can remember.

387
00:47:32,110 --> 00:47:36,020
I used to quarrel with my mother and
others many times to have a look at you.

388
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:39,150
They said it's a problem and danger if I see you.

389
00:47:40,150 --> 00:47:41,110
That's it!

390
00:47:41,110 --> 00:47:42,520
From then I never got to see you...

391
00:47:42,610 --> 00:47:46,270
Oh God! You know, as soon as I woke up everyday,
I would ask about you.

392
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:50,400
I used to feel happy when they told me stories about you.

393
00:47:50,610 --> 00:47:53,190
I used to visit the temple which you visit every day.

394
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:57,020
I used to pray for you at the same place
where you offered prayers.

395
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:02,020
During the ceremony, when I sensed you walking towards to me...

396
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:04,480
I Immediately move to a near by pond.

397
00:48:05,150 --> 00:48:09,400
I felt it would lead to a bad curse even
if I see your reflection in the water.

398
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:17,520
Since these last 24 years I had no other world.

399
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:21,860
I was awaiting for this moment to have
a heartful look at you.

400
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:25,820
I didn't see you even during the Yagna.

401
00:48:27,020 --> 00:48:31,320
I know I would cry if I see you...

402
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:35,940
I didn't want everyone in Yagna watching me cry.

403
00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:44,610
Can I see you now?

404
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:22,150
Will you make me a promise?

405
00:49:23,270 --> 00:49:27,320
I know nothing other than adoring you.

406
00:49:28,730 --> 00:49:33,190
You can live the way you like and do whatever you like...

407
00:49:34,730 --> 00:49:40,150
But promise me that you wouldn't abandon me.

408
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:13,520
Welcome to 'Koilkuntla'

409
00:50:13,770 --> 00:50:14,650
Welcome.

410
00:50:21,150 --> 00:50:24,190
Looks like this area is very peaceful

411
00:50:47,460 --> 00:50:50,210
Hey Subbaiah, you have a good news...

412
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:54,580
You don't need to pay taxes for the crops you grow,
you only need pay for the land you own.

413
00:50:55,750 --> 00:50:57,120
Didn't you get it?

414
00:50:57,460 --> 00:51:02,830
Whether you get yield from the crops or not,
you have to pay taxes based on the land you have.

415
00:51:02,910 --> 00:51:06,750
Sir, we are unable to pay taxes for the crops itself...

416
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:10,540
How can we pay taxes just for the land
which might not yield everytime?

417
00:51:10,710 --> 00:51:13,790
Then as per the law the lands belong to us.

418
00:51:14,790 --> 00:51:17,960
Pay them wages for their labour, Raghavachari.

419
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:22,250
Are we labour!? Sir, this land is our mother.

420
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:24,500
How can we live without our mother, Sir?

421
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:26,040
How far are your lands?

422
00:51:26,370 --> 00:51:29,330
They'd be till that hill Sir, a total of five villages Sir.

423
00:51:30,290 --> 00:51:32,870
Will you do anything to own your lands?

424
00:51:32,910 --> 00:51:34,790
Yes, I'll give my life Sir

425
00:51:42,250 --> 00:51:43,210
Let's play a game.

426
00:51:43,870 --> 00:51:46,580
Run as far as you can from here.

427
00:51:46,910 --> 00:51:50,040
All the land you step on is yours.

428
00:51:51,540 --> 00:51:55,710
But, my horse will run along with you.

429
00:51:58,370 --> 00:52:02,330
If my horse crosses you by a step, then the land is ours.

430
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:07,580
If you cross my horse by even a step, land is yours.

431
00:52:10,830 --> 00:52:11,910
Will you run?

432
00:52:23,660 --> 00:52:24,370
Run!

433
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:16,540
He fell down.

434
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:30,830
It’s gone.

435
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:36,540
All of your land has gone.

436
00:53:37,540 --> 00:53:41,660
Sir, looks like our Horse is going to run till Mysore.

437
00:53:41,750 --> 00:53:43,290
Run you...

438
00:54:33,910 --> 00:54:35,120
Get up..Subbayya

439
00:54:38,370 --> 00:54:39,290
Slowly..

440
00:54:41,210 --> 00:54:42,120
Slowly..

441
00:54:48,370 --> 00:54:51,580
Reddy Sir, You say not to pay taxes...

442
00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:54,710
but Jameson says you are no longer a chief...

443
00:54:55,460 --> 00:55:00,500
I mean, as your adoption to Nossam
isn’t legal as per the new Dalhousie law.

444
00:55:00,580 --> 00:55:03,540
That means, you aren’t the legal heir...

445
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:04,910
Oh no!

446
00:55:07,250 --> 00:55:10,000
Who are you to question my legacy?

447
00:55:10,460 --> 00:55:14,660
Were you born to my father when he visited your country?
Did your father get born to my grandfather?

448
00:55:15,210 --> 00:55:18,160
Are you my brother? my son? my son in law?
or my co-brother?

449
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:22,540
Shut up, you too are labor like these.

450
00:55:22,580 --> 00:55:25,830
Punishment is a must if tax isn't paid. Arrest him

451
00:55:26,870 --> 00:55:28,870
Why should we pay you the tax?

452
00:55:28,870 --> 00:55:32,330
The rain wouldn’t ask for it, the wet land
wouldn’t ask for it, the crop wouldn’t ask for it.

453
00:55:32,330 --> 00:55:35,210
Who are you to ask us to pay tax?

454
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:50,160
From the land to the end crop,
the farm is ours, the sweat is ours,

455
00:55:50,210 --> 00:55:54,660
the plant is ours, the water is ours, the stem is ours,
the reap is ours, the heap is ours.

456
00:55:54,750 --> 00:55:56,580
Why do we need to pay tax to you?

457
00:56:05,750 --> 00:56:09,540
we were born on this land and we will die here.

458
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:12,290
Why do we need to pay tax to you?

459
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:17,830
Subbayya...
- Sir

460
00:56:17,910 --> 00:56:20,960
Who ploughed this land?
- We did.

461
00:56:23,710 --> 00:56:26,540
Then whom does the crop belong to?
- To us

462
00:56:26,580 --> 00:56:29,460
Ours
- Ours

463
00:56:40,410 --> 00:56:43,870
My Lord! See the crowd behind...

464
00:56:44,410 --> 00:56:47,000
Look around, this isn't the right time.

465
00:56:47,710 --> 00:56:49,250
Come, Please come.

466
00:56:53,330 --> 00:56:56,960
Bow your head.
Come on bow your head

467
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:00,870
Go!

468
00:57:01,370 --> 00:57:05,080
Go back in this same manner without
raising your head...

469
00:57:05,580 --> 00:57:07,830
Raise your head once you reach London...

470
00:57:07,910 --> 00:57:13,750
If you step on this land again rising your head,
I'll cut it off.

471
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:14,870
Get out!

472
00:57:29,250 --> 00:57:31,410
Sir... please spare the poor horse.

473
00:57:31,540 --> 00:57:34,330
Narasimha Reddy has put fear in it...

474
00:57:34,750 --> 00:57:36,580
Whenever I sit on it...

475
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:42,120
it reminds me of that fear.

476
00:57:42,830 --> 00:57:44,710
Please don't do... no...

477
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:47,580
My Lord! It is burning

478
00:57:55,790 --> 00:58:00,410
Do you want me to Inform Madras to send a Batallion sir?

479
00:58:04,250 --> 00:58:07,080
I'm the strength for that Madras

480
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:11,120
It isn't Narasimha Reddy who needs to be killed...

481
00:58:12,870 --> 00:58:16,210
but the courage in those slaves need to be killed.

482
00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:23,500
I'll show the hidden fear in them.

483
00:58:27,290 --> 00:58:28,960
Spare his region.

484
00:58:30,750 --> 00:58:34,160
Go and loot the unpaid tax from
the remaining Dattamandalam.

485
00:58:39,830 --> 00:58:44,910
The death cries of the people should
create terror in his villagers.

486
00:58:48,750 --> 00:58:53,830
In the midst of that terror, I should burn him up.

487
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:42,250
It seems you asked them not to pay taxes?

488
00:59:42,540 --> 00:59:44,500
I'm taking over your fort

489
01:00:06,830 --> 01:00:11,330
We shouldn’t leave even a fist of our loot.

490
01:00:11,830 --> 01:00:14,910
What about Dattamandalam tax?
- We have collected from all of the areas...

491
01:00:15,710 --> 01:00:16,960
except for one area.

492
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,040
Salutations.

493
01:00:21,620 --> 01:00:22,330
Tell me..

494
01:00:22,410 --> 01:00:26,580
Sir! along with the special prayers which
are being conducted by Jangama Mallaiah tomorrow...

495
01:00:26,620 --> 01:00:31,080
we are planning to get all the pending marriages done.

496
01:00:31,290 --> 01:00:32,210
Good!

497
01:00:32,210 --> 01:00:35,410
Give the Invitation to my Brother.

498
01:00:35,410 --> 01:00:36,460
Ok Sir

499
01:00:37,790 --> 01:00:40,000
Mr. Jangam Mallaih
- Sir

500
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:43,210
I'm offering my prayers tomorrow on Jagannatha hill...

501
01:00:44,250 --> 01:00:48,210
you can also begin the special prayers at the same time.

502
01:00:48,540 --> 01:00:49,460
Ok Sir!

503
01:00:49,540 --> 01:00:50,830
Obanna
- Sir

504
01:00:50,910 --> 01:00:57,460
Distribute this year's pension we get for Nossam Fort
as a marriage gift to all the couples here.

505
01:00:57,540 --> 01:00:58,410
Ok Sir.

506
01:00:59,460 --> 01:01:00,830
Pension.

507
01:01:01,410 --> 01:01:06,750
He came to collect pension it seems!

508
01:01:09,660 --> 01:01:13,830
We already told that Narasimha Reddy isn't a Palegar
as he was an adopted heir.

509
01:01:13,830 --> 01:01:18,910
We will not give him Pension at any cost.
Shave his head fully...

510
01:01:18,910 --> 01:01:21,250
He won't come again.

511
01:01:41,250 --> 01:01:46,330
No dear... first this need to be offered to the God,
only then we can eat.

512
01:01:46,330 --> 01:01:47,830
I am starving, Mother.

513
01:01:47,830 --> 01:01:50,910
(Everyone prays to the deity)

514
01:01:56,210 --> 01:01:59,460
All of you please bring your first reap
as an offering to the goddess.

515
01:02:00,910 --> 01:02:03,160
(Chants)

516
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:24,370
Charge!

517
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:45,330
Looks like you all had a good yield?

518
01:02:46,370 --> 01:02:49,040
Soldiers, load all this harvest into our carts.
- Come on, load into our cart.

519
01:02:52,830 --> 01:02:55,500
Sir. We have been waiting
for this harvest since two years.

520
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:57,790
We can only give some part of this.

521
01:02:57,790 --> 01:02:58,830
How?

522
01:02:58,910 --> 01:03:02,910
You said this land is yours and this crop is yours.

523
01:03:02,910 --> 01:03:05,410
Where did you get that courage from?

524
01:03:06,830 --> 01:03:11,330
Even if the yield from all these 66 villages is paid to us,
you all would still have to pay another year of yield.

525
01:03:11,370 --> 01:03:14,790
Sir, if you take away the whole yield...
what shall we eat?

526
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,620
Please spare us for this time.

527
01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:20,910
Ok,

528
01:03:25,410 --> 01:03:27,410
Tell them our British rule, Raghavachari

529
01:03:27,460 --> 01:03:28,370
Ok, my Lord!

530
01:03:28,580 --> 01:03:30,080
All of you listen carefully!

531
01:03:30,830 --> 01:03:33,460
British Empire has passed a new rule.

532
01:03:34,620 --> 01:03:41,710
From now on whoever gets married,
the Bride will first sleep with the English Master.

533
01:03:46,540 --> 01:03:48,250
This is for your own good.

534
01:03:49,460 --> 01:03:53,160
At least this way your black race turn white.

535
01:04:00,410 --> 01:04:03,290
I will first sleep with all these 10 brides.

536
01:04:04,580 --> 01:04:07,830
Aaah, don’t be afraid.

537
01:04:11,370 --> 01:04:13,540
I don’t need everyone at a time.

538
01:04:13,540 --> 01:04:15,870
Send me one every night.

539
01:04:17,210 --> 01:04:22,910
All the villages decide which girl will be sent
each day and take back your crop.

540
01:04:24,460 --> 01:04:27,710
Will you offer me the crop or the girls?

541
01:04:29,830 --> 01:04:31,160
Why are you crying?

542
01:04:31,290 --> 01:04:34,000
he said he would be returning your crop as a wage
for offering the brides, right?

543
01:04:34,080 --> 01:04:36,040
Send those brides... you can have your crop back.

544
01:04:36,250 --> 01:04:41,040
Sir, we eat food to live...
but we can't sell our self-respect for food, Sir

545
01:04:41,160 --> 01:04:44,960
Take away our crops Sir
- Take away our crops...

546
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:54,080
After all, for the sake of a woman’s virtue,
66 Villages crops are sacrificed.

547
01:04:55,500 --> 01:04:57,290
You bloody barbarians!

548
01:04:57,370 --> 01:04:58,620
Soldiers, move the crop.

549
01:05:16,410 --> 01:05:17,540
Basavaiah...

550
01:05:21,160 --> 01:05:22,290
Basavaiah...

551
01:05:24,540 --> 01:05:25,660
Basavaiah...

552
01:05:27,210 --> 01:05:29,210
Basavaiah, put it back.

553
01:05:29,370 --> 01:05:31,210
Forgive him Sir, he's a small kid

554
01:05:31,500 --> 01:05:32,210
It is wrong, son

555
01:05:32,250 --> 01:05:35,080
I didn't steal this... mother, it is ours

556
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:39,000
He is stealing it and is taking it away...

557
01:05:39,120 --> 01:05:40,790
Don't talk like this... put it back.

558
01:05:41,120 --> 01:05:42,830
Please put it back, son
- I won't

559
01:05:48,410 --> 01:05:49,460
Basavaiah...

560
01:05:53,540 --> 01:05:54,660
My son!

561
01:05:54,870 --> 01:05:57,080
Put it back.

562
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:03,250
Please let me go...
let me go.

563
01:06:03,500 --> 01:06:05,410
Put it back, son

564
01:06:05,410 --> 01:06:06,410
Put it back.

565
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,250
Put it back, son

566
01:06:14,910 --> 01:06:16,000
Let me go.

567
01:06:18,370 --> 01:06:19,370
Basavaiah...

568
01:06:22,250 --> 01:06:23,250
Put it back.

569
01:07:13,160 --> 01:07:14,540
Mother...!

570
01:07:14,870 --> 01:07:19,210
Oh no! My Son..! My son!

571
01:07:19,210 --> 01:07:21,160
Oh no! Don't harm him Sir.

572
01:07:38,210 --> 01:07:42,290
Hey, I’m giving time untill tomorrow evening.

573
01:07:43,580 --> 01:07:44,750
Let him come.

574
01:07:45,460 --> 01:07:48,080
Koilkuntla is my place.

575
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:53,750
Ask him to come, touch my feet and apologise.

576
01:07:53,750 --> 01:07:57,250
I would let him live like a slave,

577
01:07:57,250 --> 01:08:00,910
otherwise will burn him right in front of you.

578
01:08:01,250 --> 01:08:02,750
Obanna!!!
-Sir...

579
01:08:02,750 --> 01:08:04,500
Proclaim this...

580
01:08:05,290 --> 01:08:10,120
throughout the Dattamandalam, to every street,
to every village, to every house...

581
01:08:10,120 --> 01:08:12,120
tell it loud,

582
01:08:12,120 --> 01:08:14,460
Within the time he challenged...

583
01:08:14,460 --> 01:08:18,750
I’m going to chop his head at his own place.

584
01:08:18,750 --> 01:08:23,210
This has to be witnessed by every
person belonging to this Renadu.

585
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:28,210
I’m stating this in the presence of the burnt fist of this boy,

586
01:08:28,500 --> 01:08:31,620
in the presence of this hanged farmers...

587
01:08:31,620 --> 01:08:34,540
in the presence of these brides crying.

588
01:08:35,910 --> 01:08:40,160
This is the death statement issued
by Majjaari Narasimha Reddy!

589
01:09:02,540 --> 01:09:05,290
Have you come here to witness my death???!

590
01:09:15,250 --> 01:09:17,500
Jameson is immortal.

591
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:19,080
Ask him to come.

592
01:15:55,710 --> 01:16:00,000
Hail Narasimha Reddy

593
01:16:00,410 --> 01:16:03,660
Hail Narasimha Reddy

594
01:16:27,040 --> 01:16:30,330
Sir, the money looted from
Dattamandalam isn't there in the treasury

595
01:16:30,410 --> 01:16:33,000
Only 805 rupees, 10 Annas and 4 paisa is left.

596
01:16:33,080 --> 01:16:34,830
All of it is going to Madras.

597
01:16:35,080 --> 01:16:38,960
Let it be gone...
we got rid of this Jameson... that's enough

598
01:16:39,080 --> 01:16:40,120
It isn't enough

599
01:16:43,330 --> 01:16:49,080
His death isn't important for us,
the wealth he looted is important.

600
01:16:51,830 --> 01:16:54,750
That belongs to us.
It's our self-respect

601
01:16:54,790 --> 01:16:57,620
Not even a single blade of grass should cross our land.

602
01:16:59,500 --> 01:17:02,000
Soldiers, get ready.

603
01:17:41,330 --> 01:17:42,330
No.

604
01:17:55,960 --> 01:17:57,080
What happened?

605
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:15,210
Narasimha Swamy has been born again.

606
01:18:17,620 --> 01:18:18,210
What?

607
01:18:18,290 --> 01:18:21,750
The story you like to call Myth, has now come true.

608
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:28,710
There once was an evil king Hiranya Kashyapa
who thought he was immortal.

609
01:18:28,710 --> 01:18:30,870
Jameson is immortal

610
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:34,750
To kill him Narasimha Swamy came tearing out of a pillar.

611
01:18:37,710 --> 01:18:40,790
His death occured neither in the house nor outside...

612
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:42,830
neither in the day nor in the night...

613
01:18:43,910 --> 01:18:45,960
neither in the sky nor on the earth...

614
01:18:46,370 --> 01:18:48,160
he was destroyed.

615
01:18:48,660 --> 01:18:50,960
That incarnation ended with that death.

616
01:18:51,210 --> 01:18:53,910
This incarnation has begun now with this death, Sir.

617
01:18:55,790 --> 01:18:56,750
Bull shit!

618
01:18:57,290 --> 01:19:03,580
The consequences of your incarnation defying
a mighty empire will be written in the history.

619
01:19:03,660 --> 01:19:06,910
Soldiers, for the Queen
- Queen

620
01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:08,620
Crown
- Crown

621
01:19:08,710 --> 01:19:11,000
And the country
- Country

622
01:19:11,750 --> 01:19:15,080
[Sanskrit Sloka]

623
01:19:32,850 --> 01:19:36,730
Is he a reincarnation of God Narasimha,
No... create him as a dacoit.

624
01:19:38,100 --> 01:19:42,100
He has looted all the wealth that
belongs to our British empire.

625
01:19:42,520 --> 01:19:45,020
He isn't a God but a Bandit!

626
01:19:51,680 --> 01:19:53,890
I want to see this Narasimha Reddy.

627
01:19:54,140 --> 01:19:56,930
Prepare a sketch by an artist who has seen him.

628
01:20:06,310 --> 01:20:09,350
Before this letter reaches London,
his head should be beheaded

629
01:20:09,430 --> 01:20:13,520
Sir! 57th regiment, 300 soldiers ready.

630
01:20:13,520 --> 01:20:14,680
Now everyone move...

631
01:20:14,730 --> 01:20:19,350
chop him into four pieces,
throw those three pieces in the Dattamandalam.

632
01:20:19,350 --> 01:20:23,020
The fourth one, his head; I should see it

633
01:20:23,020 --> 01:20:24,600
Soldiers, advance.

634
01:20:39,430 --> 01:20:41,600
I can see a war looming in the future.

635
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:44,390
I foresee an Independent India raising.

636
01:20:45,850 --> 01:20:46,770
Syeraa...

637
01:20:48,020 --> 01:20:50,850
All the wars fought on this earth, were for power.

638
01:20:51,850 --> 01:20:54,640
This is the war happening for freedom.

639
01:20:55,310 --> 01:20:57,430
You must win this war.

640
01:20:59,350 --> 01:21:01,100
War itself will win!

641
01:21:01,230 --> 01:21:05,310
You are able to ignite the rage you had,
into common people.

642
01:21:05,980 --> 01:21:09,850
You were able to create a daring
attitude in a small kid, to tighten his fist.

643
01:21:10,350 --> 01:21:12,520
Internal conflict has ended...

644
01:21:14,020 --> 01:21:18,890
by chopping off the head of the British,
you’ve begun the real war.

645
01:21:19,680 --> 01:21:25,810
Do you trust these Chiefs to be united
and join your cause?

646
01:21:26,140 --> 01:21:27,930
You want us to join your cause...?

647
01:21:28,180 --> 01:21:30,270
Should we all walk along with you?

648
01:21:30,270 --> 01:21:33,310
It's not that we are lacking courage as we haven't revolted.

649
01:21:33,310 --> 01:21:37,310
Greatest kings themselves collapsed after opposing the British.

650
01:21:38,230 --> 01:21:39,640
Whose support do we have anyway?

651
01:21:40,430 --> 01:21:41,140
The people!!!

652
01:21:49,350 --> 01:21:50,890
People themselves will fight the war.

653
01:21:51,140 --> 01:21:53,730
A civil war? I didn’t get you.

654
01:21:54,270 --> 01:21:57,180
Kings fight with kings, soldiers fight with soldiers.

655
01:21:57,480 --> 01:21:59,350
Have people ever fought with rulers?

656
01:22:00,100 --> 01:22:01,060
Has this happened anywhere?

657
01:22:01,180 --> 01:22:02,350
It will happen now.

658
01:22:04,520 --> 01:22:06,060
If we want to, we can do it.

659
01:22:06,520 --> 01:22:10,680
Even though we Chiefs lack power,
people still believe us to be their leaders.

660
01:22:11,310 --> 01:22:15,180
If we fight, people too will follow us.

661
01:22:15,270 --> 01:22:17,560
With people, this will take form into a Revolt,

662
01:22:17,640 --> 01:22:20,480
this Revolt will turn into a movement and
later this movement shall tranform into a war.

663
01:22:22,770 --> 01:22:27,140
We can only achieve freedom for this country,
if the people joins the war.

664
01:22:31,430 --> 01:22:35,430
First, we need to think about how to avoid the upcoming danger.

665
01:22:37,980 --> 01:22:43,180
Malla Reddy, all of us have come to a decision, right?
Tell that to your brother

666
01:22:44,600 --> 01:22:48,430
Brother, you’ve distributed the treasure
you’ve looted to all the villages.

667
01:22:48,430 --> 01:22:51,640
Becasue of you we turned enemies to the Brits.

668
01:22:51,930 --> 01:22:54,390
Hence we’ve come to a decision.

669
01:22:55,520 --> 01:22:59,730
We shall talk to the Brits and
make sure no harm comes to you.

670
01:23:00,060 --> 01:23:03,810
Just tell the Brits that we chiefs had nothing
to do with what happened and...

671
01:23:04,100 --> 01:23:06,270
ask for an apology.

672
01:23:13,230 --> 01:23:14,980
Apologise to the British?

673
01:23:17,230 --> 01:23:21,480
If you repeat me to ask an apology again,
I would chop your head.

674
01:23:22,600 --> 01:23:24,430
I wouldn’t care even if you are my elder brother

675
01:23:35,180 --> 01:23:37,890
Brother’s head... Apology...

676
01:23:38,350 --> 01:23:41,520
This isn’t a bull competition Narasimha Reddy.

677
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:44,560
Not a bull competition.

678
01:23:46,770 --> 01:23:51,060
It's a war with 300 soldiers equipped with cannons.

679
01:23:52,890 --> 01:23:54,600
There’s no one with you.

680
01:23:54,850 --> 01:23:58,850
no one here will join you... Narasimha Reddy

681
01:24:00,180 --> 01:24:02,850
what can you alone achieve?

682
01:24:07,480 --> 01:24:08,560
I will fight.

683
01:24:26,230 --> 01:24:27,480
Sir...!

684
01:24:36,980 --> 01:24:40,140
Sir, I’m with you.

685
01:24:42,640 --> 01:24:45,890
I’ll fight with you, even if no one comes with you.

686
01:25:05,680 --> 01:25:07,560
I knew this day would come.

687
01:25:07,680 --> 01:25:09,230
I have been training myself ever since then.

688
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:20,020
I ploughed my own land, I ate my own food,
I grew my own muscle and can run now faster.

689
01:25:20,180 --> 01:25:23,890
I can kill at least ten people before I die.

690
01:25:27,770 --> 01:25:29,560
I’m with you.

691
01:25:29,560 --> 01:25:30,850
Lead us.

692
01:25:38,890 --> 01:25:41,680
Hail Narasimha Reddy...

695
01:27:37,390 --> 01:27:38,930
Narasimha Reddy...

696
01:27:39,180 --> 01:27:46,100
this is Daniel of the 57th regiment of the
British Company, Madras Presidency

697
01:27:46,230 --> 01:27:48,770
Come forward and show your...

Prepare the cannon.

701
01:28:25,810 --> 01:28:29,890
I repeat, Narasimha Reddy surrender.

Renadu warriors!

708
01:29:53,180 --> 01:30:01,020
This war isn’t for you, it's for your brothers,
it's for your mothers and it's for your children.

709
01:30:03,520 --> 01:30:09,430
We might not exist in the history.
But the history should begin with us today.

710
01:30:11,180 --> 01:30:14,480
We may be just 40 ordinary people to them.

711
01:30:14,890 --> 01:30:19,430
History should state that these ordinary
people themselves have demolished an empire.

712
01:30:21,770 --> 01:30:23,930
War field may be a new thing to you.

713
01:30:24,020 --> 01:30:26,730
You may have never done a war holding a weapon...

714
01:30:26,810 --> 01:30:31,890
But hunting isn’t new for you and
hunting down the wild animals isn’t new.

715
01:30:33,310 --> 01:30:34,890
So, let us hunt.

Come back.

736
01:38:08,730 --> 01:38:14,560
Though no Chief would support you
for fear of these 300 Brits, you stood alone...

737
01:38:18,180 --> 01:38:19,850
That's when you won me over.

738
01:38:21,100 --> 01:38:25,640
The same 300 Brits feared you and asked for my help...

739
01:38:27,390 --> 01:38:29,890
That was the moment...

740
01:38:34,930 --> 01:38:36,020
you've won those 300 Brits.

741
01:38:37,600 --> 01:38:40,100
I have come to witness your victory with my own eyes.

I admire you, Avuku Raju.

But I won't admire you.

01:38:49,980 --> 01:38:52,480
You're always ahead of me in doing
the great deeds which I hope to do...

746
01:38:52,480 --> 01:38:55,520
you picked up where I left off.

747
01:38:57,640 --> 01:38:59,930
That is why I don't like you.

748
01:39:04,140 --> 01:39:05,060
One fine day,

749
01:39:07,480 --> 01:39:12,060
I’ll be far ahead of you in this movement.

To the... who slash the hands of people
who feed them, the following content is a warning.

764
01:41:33,330 --> 01:41:36,290
You’ve called me a Bandit for killing just one person.

765
01:41:36,830 --> 01:41:42,290
Now I’ve killed 300 of your men.
I’ll make it clear, this is a revolt.

766
01:41:43,950 --> 01:41:46,870
This is a revolt by the people for Freedom.

767
01:41:48,540 --> 01:41:57,750
From now on instead of our white cotton,
your white corpses will be shipped;

I’m warning you, as I stand on the soil of my mother India.

Leave my country and go away.

it’ll be labelled as the war of Chiefs

Only if we stay with the people and fight...
Then it will become a people's revolution.

pride right from your childhood.

Will you forgive me for this lifetime?

804
01:45:54,830 --> 01:45:57,950
Oh God! never talk like this...

805
01:46:00,200 --> 01:46:04,330
everyone say that you are in love with someone.

806
01:46:05,580 --> 01:46:11,750
It’s true that you are in love...
but it is with this land and these people.

807

I shouldn't be a hindrance to you.

You’ve promised me not to leave.

809
01:46:22,830 --> 01:46:24,450
you should not fail.

810

So, I will leave you instead, fight with a free mind.

he has took the initiative to sacrifce all the relationships.

by tomorrow morning.

I’m asking for one last time on behalf of my Lord.
Tell me where is Narasimha Reddy..?

How many men does he have with him?
- There may be hundreds of people, Sir

Syeraa...
-Sye... Syeraa...

We won't betray the revolt any time
and we won’t quit this revolt anytime!

822

Until Mother India is free from her shackles...

823
01:48:47,250 --> 01:48:52,200
In this Freedom struggle, we are ready to kill any number
of enemies and ready to bear any number of our deaths.

She is there.

Brother in law...

01:49:40,830 --> 01:49:44,540
How did he know that we hid her in Kadapa Fort?

829
01:49:47,950 --> 01:49:50,410
Narasimha, what our brother did is a grave mistake.

830
01:49:51,250 --> 01:49:52,370
He was greedy...

831
01:49:52,370 --> 01:49:53,790
Move aside.

832
01:49:56,750 --> 01:49:58,160
Forgive him for this one time...

833
01:49:58,250 --> 01:50:00,700
Did he commit a small mistake to forgive him?

834
01:50:01,370 --> 01:50:05,830
Hey, you not only betrayed your brother,
you betrayed the movement.

835
01:50:25,410 --> 01:50:26,580
Elder mother...

836
01:50:28,120 --> 01:50:33,700
He has committed an unforgivable mistake even after
being raised by a great mother like you.

837
01:50:43,660 --> 01:50:46,620
It’s up to you, to decide the punishment.

838
01:50:55,750 --> 01:50:58,910
Sister, Please forgive him on behalf of me.

839
01:51:05,250 --> 01:51:08,950
We couldn’t catch him even after
searching in these forests for four months.

for anyone who brings me Narasimha Reddy alive.

I know where he is.
how much do you pay me?

842

How long should we still travel?

843

We have almost reached.
Will you give me the money you promised?

844

I’ll pay you more than what I promised.
Show him to me.

01:52:15,410 --> 01:52:18,580
I've come for you and he has come to win the bounty on you.

847
01:52:18,660 --> 01:52:21,160
He’s a traitor... so I gave him this reward.

848
01:52:21,620 --> 01:52:22,450

Raja Pandi
- Where did you come from?

850
01:52:26,200 --> 01:52:28,290
I come from Tamil land known for it's bravery.

851
01:52:28,370 --> 01:52:29,580
what is your business here?

852
01:52:29,620 --> 01:52:34,040
You’ve been fighting the war against the British since 6 months,
so I came to help you

853
01:52:34,660 --> 01:52:37,870
Accept me, I’ll be helpful to you
like Lakshmana was to Rama...

854
01:52:38,330 --> 01:52:40,580
in either victory or in death.

855
01:52:40,790 --> 01:52:42,250
What guys?
- Yes

856
01:52:42,450 --> 01:52:44,950
You are a Tamilian and we are Telugu people.
How can we gel together?

857
01:52:46,620 --> 01:52:49,000
But we share the same mother (India)
like we have the same brother Narasimha Reddy.

858
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:51,250
Everything is possible.

859
01:52:52,500 --> 01:52:54,830
How do you know about Narasimha Reddy?

860
01:52:54,950 --> 01:52:57,330
Everyone in Tamil land is aware of Narasimha Reddy.

861
01:52:58,330 --> 01:53:01,410
Every village there sings songs about him.

862
01:53:26,450 --> 01:53:30,160
♫ Is this the name that echoes
all over my mother land?♫

863

He has blessed you with a great art that can inspire people.

882
01:54:47,080 --> 01:54:51,540
This art isn't for you or for that God
It's for all those people who get inspired from it...

883
01:55:01,950 --> 01:55:08,830
♫ Can all our anger be held...

Madras - Watson’s force

902
01:56:29,330 --> 01:56:31,040
Cumbum - Scott’s force should be commissioned

903
01:56:31,080 --> 01:56:33,200
We will attack him on all four sides at once

904
01:56:33,200 --> 01:56:35,500

♫ Is he the sun

915
01:58:45,250 --> 01:58:46,120
What’s your name?

916
01:58:47,290 --> 01:58:47,910
Lakshmi.

917
01:58:49,120 --> 01:58:51,450
You are doing a great favour to the movement.

918
01:58:52,330 --> 01:58:54,580
You've been singing about Narasimha Reddy
as if you know him.

919
01:58:54,580 --> 01:58:55,790
Do you know him?

920
01:58:56,410 --> 01:58:59,870
I’m in the movement.
Anyway who doesn't know about the warrior..!?

921
01:59:00,040 --> 01:59:00,950
Please forgive me

922
01:59:02,040 --> 01:59:04,620
I've sung with you without your permission.

923
01:59:04,910 --> 01:59:08,330
Singing with me isn't enough...
do send a warrior to the war.

924
01:59:08,500 --> 01:59:10,200
I have sent the leader himself.

925
01:59:13,580 --> 01:59:14,540
I’m his wife

926
01:59:22,330 --> 01:59:24,870
Is he with you here...!?

927
01:59:25,500 --> 01:59:30,580
I felt I was an obstacle to the war.
I left him free to his will...

928
01:59:32,200 --> 01:59:35,790
Don’t you feel sad to live without him?

929
01:59:36,870 --> 01:59:39,410
He’s given enough love to live a full life.

930
01:59:41,040 --> 01:59:43,410
Yes, that he has.

931
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:45,450
Give him here.

932
01:59:45,620 --> 01:59:46,950
Is he your son?
- Yes

933
01:59:47,370 --> 01:59:48,200
Please....

934
01:59:58,330 --> 02:00:00,870
Oh no dear, calm down..
nothing dear, don’t cry

935
02:00:00,870 --> 02:00:02,250
Give him here

936
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:07,580
No dear, calm down

937
02:00:13,500 --> 02:00:16,660
God knows well what suits best for a person...

938
02:00:17,660 --> 02:00:22,120
He gave you the responsibility of a family
and me the responsibility to publicise the war.

939
02:00:23,410 --> 02:00:24,200
See you.

940
02:00:48,660 --> 02:00:49,750
What happened?

941
02:00:54,410 --> 02:00:57,450
I'am declaring Independence to this Renaadu.

942
02:00:57,620 --> 02:01:01,330
I will throw out every single Britsher from my mother land.

943
02:01:01,500 --> 02:01:06,120
Tell your London bosses that I’m the new king of this Renaadu.

944
02:01:08,540 --> 02:01:13,500
Tell them, If they want to step on my land, they need to pay me taxes.

945
02:01:13,500 --> 02:01:17,950
You aren't confronting slaves but Independent Indians.

946
02:01:17,950 --> 02:01:21,790
Before London gets to know about him, we should stop him.

947
02:01:21,790 --> 02:01:23,200
What's our plan?

948
02:01:37,180 --> 02:01:39,550
Mother, all of you suddenly here?

949
02:01:39,600 --> 02:01:44,100
I’m sensing something bad Narasimha.
Entire family is anxious about you.

950
02:01:44,350 --> 02:01:45,970
So we all wanted to see you.

951
02:01:46,640 --> 02:01:47,970
Nothing to worry mother...

952
02:01:48,140 --> 02:01:51,510
I have an entire army protecting me
like an eyelid protects an eye.

953
02:01:51,970 --> 02:01:55,010
There are friends like Veera Reddy
who are ready to die for me.

954
02:01:55,550 --> 02:01:57,100
Nothing bad can happen to me.

955
02:01:57,890 --> 02:01:58,850
Stay strong.

956
02:02:00,720 --> 02:02:03,850
I didn’t join him to make him the king.

957
02:02:06,550 --> 02:02:10,890
I need to be the king of this Renaadu anyday.

958
02:02:15,640 --> 02:02:16,390
Avuku Raju!

959
02:02:17,430 --> 02:02:19,430
I thought Avuku Raju was dead long back!

960
02:02:20,180 --> 02:02:22,140
Now I see the real Avuku Raju.

961
02:02:22,970 --> 02:02:26,260
Join your hands with me...
Let us be kings together

962
02:02:26,970 --> 02:02:28,390
How?

963
02:02:28,550 --> 02:02:31,720
We shall Kill Narasimha Reddy along with his family.

964
02:02:34,640 --> 02:02:35,640
What if we kill?

965
02:02:35,720 --> 02:02:37,930
This is the agreement letter written by Cochrane...

966
02:02:37,930 --> 02:02:42,010
if we can kill everyone, Renaadu will be split into two...

967
02:02:43,800 --> 02:02:47,050
northern division for me...
the southern division for you.

968
02:02:47,800 --> 02:02:49,300
Can we two people pull this of?

969
02:02:53,050 --> 02:02:55,680
There are many more like us in the army.

970
02:02:56,260 --> 02:02:58,720
I have been waiting for a strength like you.

971
02:02:59,970 --> 02:03:02,140
When shall we do this?
- Tonight...

972
02:03:02,970 --> 02:03:06,300
all of this needs to happen tonight...

973
02:03:07,180 --> 02:03:08,260
This night.

974
02:03:10,050 --> 02:03:14,430
At midnight when erveryone is asleep,
I will open the fort’s doors.

975
02:03:14,720 --> 02:03:16,350
My men will come in.

976
02:03:16,470 --> 02:03:18,720
Narasimha Reddy sleeps in the last bedroom.

977
02:03:18,890 --> 02:03:22,850
After everyone is a sleep in their rooms,
I’ll open the inside door.

978
02:03:23,010 --> 02:03:26,800
Raja Pandi who guards Narasimha Reddy
would be residing in the east room.

979
02:03:26,890 --> 02:03:28,430
I will be slashing him.

980
02:04:22,430 --> 02:04:23,470
TRAITOR ...

981
02:04:24,300 --> 02:04:26,760
You've betrayed the King.

982
02:04:28,430 --> 02:04:31,220
I won't betray my king.

983
02:04:37,970 --> 02:04:38,760
Narasimha...

984
02:05:01,970 --> 02:05:05,550
To win the external enemies,
we should identify the internal enemies first.

985
02:05:06,600 --> 02:05:09,390
because of your betrayal,
we've lost our friends in the army.

986
02:05:10,100 --> 02:05:12,010
I should’ve killed you right then.

987
02:05:13,100 --> 02:05:18,010
To know who all are with you,
I’ve planned this game.

988
02:05:20,350 --> 02:05:21,350
End the game.

989
02:05:27,050 --> 02:05:27,720
Brother...

990
02:05:29,470 --> 02:05:32,300
Not in the heart, he’ll become a warrior.

991
02:05:33,390 --> 02:05:35,350
He made a promise and broke it...

992
02:05:36,850 --> 02:05:38,970
so pierce it into his throat.

993
02:05:41,680 --> 02:05:45,050
Avuku Raju! Forgive me.

994
02:05:49,550 --> 02:05:52,600
Person asking forgivness shouldn’t be alive Basi Reddy.

995
02:06:01,890 --> 02:06:05,600
Bravo Narasimha, you proved to be a leader.

996
02:06:06,350 --> 02:06:08,760
you’ve identified and wiped all of them efficiently.

997
02:06:08,890 --> 02:06:11,140
We have one culprit left, Veera Reddy.

998
02:06:53,510 --> 02:06:57,720
As long as greed and fear exist in this world,
people like him continue to exist.

999
02:06:58,260 --> 02:07:00,100
I thought of killing him on spot.

1000
02:07:00,930 --> 02:07:02,550
But you flashed in my mind.

1001
02:07:02,600 --> 02:07:05,350
It’s upto you how you punish him.

1002
02:07:14,720 --> 02:07:18,800
A traitor committing a sin against the Revolution
should die even if it’s my son.

1003
02:07:32,260 --> 02:07:34,550
You can’t do it. Leave it to me

1004
02:07:39,850 --> 02:07:41,180
Kill that TRAITOR.

1005
02:08:04,300 --> 02:08:05,180
Get lost.

1006
02:08:35,720 --> 02:08:37,510
Lakshmi...!

1007
02:08:58,100 --> 02:09:03,220
Sir, this woman is touring all the villages
propogating revolt by singing songs.

1008
02:09:03,300 --> 02:09:04,510
The dancer!

1009
02:09:08,470 --> 02:09:10,890
A sword is useful in a war,

1010
02:09:10,890 --> 02:09:13,760
but an art can initiate a war.

1011
02:09:14,140 --> 02:09:15,970
She’s dangerous than Narasimha Reddy.

1012
02:09:16,180 --> 02:09:19,140
Sir, she’s the love intrest of Narasimha Reddy

1013
02:09:24,430 --> 02:09:28,350
Soldiers, she’s inciting the public with her art.

1014
02:09:29,050 --> 02:09:32,180
She'll incite us too with the same art...

1015
02:09:32,180 --> 02:09:33,390
naked...

1016
02:09:41,180 --> 02:09:42,430
Ragahavachari!

1017
02:09:42,930 --> 02:09:45,050
At least I will get satisfied with my eyes.

1018
02:09:50,970 --> 02:09:53,550
This body is born for Narasimha Reddy,

1019
02:09:54,470 --> 02:09:56,680
no one else has the eligibility to touch it.

1020
02:09:58,260 --> 02:10:02,550
Hey, do you think Narasimha Reddy will come to save you?

1021
02:10:03,100 --> 02:10:05,140
Once look around...

1022
02:10:05,640 --> 02:10:12,010
There are thousands of boxes with explosives,
not for the war but for a massacre.

1023
02:10:14,600 --> 02:10:18,550
None of the Dattamandalam people
will witness the sunrise tomorrow morning...

1024
02:10:18,800 --> 02:10:20,800
including your Narasimha Reddy.

1025
02:10:20,930 --> 02:10:24,220
You have no alternative...
Now go and dance.

1026
02:10:25,010 --> 02:10:25,970
Go

1027
02:10:43,430 --> 02:10:45,680
Every life should have a purpose.

1028
02:10:45,680 --> 02:10:48,640
Every death should lead to an another life on this land.

1029
02:10:49,300 --> 02:10:53,930
When we find out the reason why we are born,
only then we can know the purpose we can die for.

1030
02:11:50,470 --> 02:11:51,930
Soldiers Jump.

1031
02:13:15,430 --> 02:13:17,800
(Chants)

1032
02:13:21,760 --> 02:13:23,760
Sir, please provide the name and other details.

1033
02:13:24,300 --> 02:13:25,140
Lakshmi.

1034
02:13:25,220 --> 02:13:25,970
No.

1035
02:13:27,550 --> 02:13:28,970
Lakshmi Narasimha Reddy.

1036
02:13:45,550 --> 02:13:50,550
A Woman acting as a suicide weapon has
killed 300 British soldiers!

1037
02:13:50,890 --> 02:13:54,180
Why are 9000 men behind a single man?

1038
02:13:54,640 --> 02:13:56,390
What is happening?

1039
02:13:56,390 --> 02:14:02,720
Freedom fight, he feels he’s waging a civil rebellion
just because he has few sheep with him.

1040
02:14:02,720 --> 02:14:03,930
Civil rebellion...?

1041
02:14:04,850 --> 02:14:08,970
My Lord! I would not worry about
an army of lions lead by a sheep,

1042
02:14:08,970 --> 02:14:12,260
I would worry about an army of sheep lead by a lion.

1043
02:14:12,260 --> 02:14:14,720
It will transform all of these sheep into lions.

1044
02:14:17,010 --> 02:14:20,850
This valorous Vermilion on your forehead has to transform
into an independent Vermilion on mother India.

1045
02:14:22,470 --> 02:14:27,720
Declare the WAR. Invite him for peace talk and
if he is reluctant, kill all his men.

1046
02:14:27,720 --> 02:14:29,930
Slaughter the demons.

1047
02:15:13,970 --> 02:15:16,100
My dear patriots...

1048
02:15:19,010 --> 02:15:22,850
It's time to repay our motherland.

1049
02:15:24,390 --> 02:15:29,220
Let’s shed our blood and get freedom
to our motherland.

1050
02:15:29,350 --> 02:15:33,140
Syeraa...
Sye.. Syeraa..

1051
02:15:47,140 --> 02:15:49,260
Prepare the cannons.

1052
02:15:55,260 --> 02:15:56,300
Fire.

1053
02:16:17,010 --> 02:16:19,350
Prepare the Artillery.

1054
02:16:26,390 --> 02:16:27,640
Fire

1055
02:16:46,350 --> 02:16:47,680
Charge.

1056
02:19:45,850 --> 02:19:47,510
Attack

1057
02:20:31,550 --> 02:20:33,640
Raja Pandi...

1058
02:22:33,360 --> 02:22:35,270
3000 of his men are dead.

1059
02:22:35,270 --> 02:22:37,730
10000 of our men have died.

1060
02:22:38,440 --> 02:22:39,980
You try to hide this from me!

1061
02:22:40,940 --> 02:22:42,980
What about Narasimha Reddy?

1062
02:22:42,980 --> 02:22:44,650
He’s very badly wounded Sir.

1063
02:22:44,650 --> 02:22:47,860
Spread rumours that Narasimha Reddy is dead.

1064
02:22:47,940 --> 02:22:48,690
Sir, he's not....

1065
02:22:48,690 --> 02:22:53,440
Narasimha Reddy isn’t a name. It’s a symbol of freedom.

1066
02:22:53,440 --> 02:22:56,690
When he killed one of our men, 40 men joined him,

1067
02:22:56,690 --> 02:22:59,820
when he killed 300 of our men, 4000 people joined him.

1068
02:23:00,020 --> 02:23:04,730
If the people in this country come
to know that 10000 British have died,

1069
02:23:04,820 --> 02:23:08,570
those thousands would become Lakhs,
the Lakhs would become crores.

1070
02:23:08,570 --> 02:23:10,820
The country’s people would revolt.

1071
02:23:13,270 --> 02:23:16,270
People here are in a rage.

1072
02:23:17,360 --> 02:23:20,150
When they hear about their leader’s death,

1073
02:23:20,360 --> 02:23:22,570
the rage would calm down...

1074
02:23:22,980 --> 02:23:24,770
and their courage will die.

1075
02:23:25,520 --> 02:23:30,070
They need to hear about his death not his victory.

1076
02:23:30,730 --> 02:23:33,270
By the time they realise the truth,

1077
02:23:33,360 --> 02:23:33,940
Sir...

1078
02:23:46,690 --> 02:23:48,270
Mr. Veera Reddy...

1079
02:23:52,570 --> 02:23:56,400
you are my enemy and I’m your enemy.

1080
02:23:56,610 --> 02:23:58,440
I know about you.

1081
02:23:59,020 --> 02:24:03,110
I felt pity on you after coming to know
the injustice you faced.

1082
02:24:05,270 --> 02:24:09,900
I heard you had a son and you loved him very much.

1083
02:24:10,900 --> 02:24:14,360
It seems, Narasimha Reddy killed him.

1084
02:24:14,900 --> 02:24:18,270
Narasimha Reddy killed him as he betrayed the revolt.

1085
02:24:18,770 --> 02:24:22,940
Then why did he spare his brother
for the same sin?

1086
02:24:26,650 --> 02:24:30,020
Shouldn't the law be the same for every blood?

1087
02:24:30,230 --> 02:24:31,980
Injustice!

1088
02:24:31,980 --> 02:24:36,570
Bloody blood relations! Always leading to injustice.

1089
02:24:36,770 --> 02:24:43,190
I myself my blood boiling,
how come you are silent Veera Reddy?

1090
02:24:45,980 --> 02:24:49,110
I haven’t come here to take advantage of you...

1091
02:24:49,440 --> 02:24:53,190
Learn who is taking advantage of you.

1092
02:24:54,320 --> 02:24:56,440
Think about it, Veera Reddy.

1093
02:25:11,610 --> 02:25:16,150
Swamy, no one knows about
what exactly happened in the war.

1094
02:25:16,610 --> 02:25:19,520
Everyone are saying my son is dead.

1095
02:25:19,650 --> 02:25:20,820
I’m afraid.

1096
02:25:22,440 --> 02:25:24,440
Today is full moon day of Karthika month.

1097
02:25:26,940 --> 02:25:29,360
The Diya on the Jagannatha Mountain will be lit.

1098
02:25:44,110 --> 02:25:45,440
Where are you headed to, Narasimha?

1099
02:25:46,480 --> 02:25:48,150
Today is the full moon day of Karthika month.

1100
02:25:48,900 --> 02:25:51,070
I should light the Diya on the Mountain.

1101
02:25:51,440 --> 02:25:53,110
Is it so important at this point of time?

1102
02:25:53,360 --> 02:25:56,230
The British are already spreading romours that you are dead.

1103
02:25:57,480 --> 02:26:01,440
Tonight thousands of eyes will be hopefully
looking at that mountain.

1104
02:26:01,650 --> 02:26:05,730
They all should know that we won the war
and our revolt is still alive

1105
02:26:05,730 --> 02:26:07,400
Now you are more important than the Diya.

1106
02:26:07,610 --> 02:26:11,860
No, the hope people have on us is more important
the Diya being lit is more important.

1107
02:26:12,230 --> 02:26:14,820
For some reason, I am sensing something bad,
Narasimha Reddy

1108
02:26:14,900 --> 02:26:18,440
What Narasimha Reddy said is true.
The hope shouldn’t die

1109
02:26:24,150 --> 02:26:27,110
Nothing bad will happen to me,
believe me.

1110
02:27:26,900 --> 02:27:27,820
Siddhamma?

1111
02:27:34,940 --> 02:27:35,730
Siddhamma...

1112
02:27:35,940 --> 02:27:36,940
How have you been ?

1113
02:27:37,020 --> 02:27:37,730
Dear...

1114
02:27:38,860 --> 02:27:41,440
Why are you here at this time now?

1115
02:27:42,150 --> 02:27:43,900
I know that you’d come here.

1116
02:27:44,520 --> 02:27:46,320
I've come to see you.

1117
02:27:47,820 --> 02:27:50,320
Are you alright?
- yes

1118
02:27:50,360 --> 02:27:53,070
I always knew nothing bad can happen to you.

1119
02:27:54,900 --> 02:27:55,730
Come dear....

1120
02:27:57,940 --> 02:27:58,900
Don't cry.

1121
02:28:00,820 --> 02:28:02,480
Dear...
- Take him.

1122
02:28:02,820 --> 02:28:06,820
What happened?
- I am feeling a weird dizziness

1123
02:28:15,270 --> 02:28:16,360
Veera Reddy...

1124
02:28:19,730 --> 02:28:20,730
Dear...

1125
02:28:22,150 --> 02:28:23,270
What's wrong with you?

1126
02:28:33,770 --> 02:28:34,770
Siddhamma...

1127
02:28:34,940 --> 02:28:38,520
It isn’t safe for you to stay here for long.
please leave from here.

1128
02:28:38,520 --> 02:28:39,730
I won't go.
-First, you go.

1129
02:28:39,940 --> 02:28:43,070
Diya shouldn’t be lit, catch him alive.

1130
02:28:44,980 --> 02:28:46,110
Slowly...

1131
02:28:47,150 --> 02:28:48,270
Slowly...

1132
02:28:50,270 --> 02:28:51,270
Siddhamma...

1133
02:28:52,270 --> 02:28:54,900
No one knows about this way.
You leave through this cave.

1134
02:28:54,900 --> 02:28:56,320
Move Fast.

1135
02:28:56,320 --> 02:28:58,110
No, I’ll stay with you

1136
02:28:58,570 --> 02:29:02,020
Siddhamma, the Diya should be lit there

1137
02:29:02,900 --> 02:29:06,730
As a mother you can light up the Diya in the coming future.

1138
02:29:07,230 --> 02:29:09,110
I have that confidence
-Dear...

1139
02:29:11,190 --> 02:29:14,020
We shouldn’t be living life for relationships...

1140
02:29:14,940 --> 02:29:16,230
but should live for responsibilities.

1141
02:31:11,570 --> 02:31:12,690
Stop him.

1142
02:31:34,900 --> 02:31:36,480
Narsi, are you alive..!?

1143
02:31:36,480 --> 02:31:38,150
Narasimha Reddy didn’t kill me father.

1144
02:31:45,020 --> 02:31:45,900
Didn't he kill you?

1145
02:31:53,690 --> 02:31:58,400
Your dad loves you madly.
He has high expectations on you.

1146
02:31:58,400 --> 02:32:03,110
Now because of you, he will be a dead soul.

1147
02:32:03,320 --> 02:32:05,690
I can’t see Veera Reddy like that...

1148
02:32:06,150 --> 02:32:06,690
Go...

1149
02:32:07,520 --> 02:32:10,440
Go and Kill him completely.

1150
02:32:11,610 --> 02:32:13,190
I have committed a sin.

1151
02:32:14,610 --> 02:32:16,320
I have committed a sin.

1152
02:32:16,980 --> 02:32:20,940
Betray the British instead of betraying us.
You would be called a patriot.

1153
02:32:20,940 --> 02:32:25,270
Do something great and only then meet your father.
That way make him alive.

1154
02:32:25,900 --> 02:32:29,070
Father, someone from our army is planning
to sedate Narasimha Reddy and help Brits arrest him.

1155
02:32:29,190 --> 02:32:30,190
I've come to inform him the same thing.

1156
02:32:30,230 --> 02:32:31,940
Father, let’s save Narasimha Reddy.

1157
02:32:33,730 --> 02:32:35,860
I’m that Traitor, son

1158
02:32:45,190 --> 02:32:47,860
What the hell did you do, father?

1159
02:33:30,440 --> 02:33:31,820
Veera Reddy..

1160
02:34:01,900 --> 02:34:03,480
Mr. Narasimha Reddy...

1161
02:34:03,480 --> 02:34:07,480
your companions Gosayi Venkanna, Avuku Raju, Papa Khan...

1162
02:34:07,480 --> 02:34:10,730
and 112 of your followers

1163
02:34:10,730 --> 02:34:13,980
are being expeled to an Island as a punishment.

1164
02:34:15,650 --> 02:34:19,650
Accept all the crimes you have committed and make an apology.

1165
02:34:19,900 --> 02:34:23,520
The British Government might reduce your punishment.

1166
02:34:23,610 --> 02:34:25,650
Apology?!
NEVER!

1167
02:34:25,900 --> 02:34:29,730
If you have a last wish, tell me now in one sentence.

1168
02:34:29,730 --> 02:34:32,610
Get out from my mother land!!!

1169
02:34:40,230 --> 02:34:45,110
According to Section 2-Regulation 1-1834 act...

1170
02:34:45,110 --> 02:34:48,980
hang him in the presence of the people.

1171
02:35:44,360 --> 02:35:45,980
Move...

1172
02:37:03,860 --> 02:37:07,190
It’d have been good if I was along
with my friend even in his death.

1173
02:37:08,230 --> 02:37:12,770
Narasimha Reddy is standing on the tip of the victory.

1174
02:37:13,820 --> 02:37:15,320
He is immortal...

1175
02:37:16,360 --> 02:37:18,360
death can’t defeat him

1176
02:37:19,400 --> 02:37:25,110
The court of faujdari adaalat
convicts the prisoner Majjari Narasimha Reddy...

1177
02:37:26,270 --> 02:37:29,820
on the counts of rebellion, murder and robbery...

1178
02:37:30,980 --> 02:37:34,860
and hence orders him to hang by the neck until death.

1179
02:38:00,820 --> 02:38:02,020
Raise your heads...

1180
02:38:08,320 --> 02:38:13,400
Wipe your eyes and watch me
with a pride filled chest...

1181
02:38:13,690 --> 02:38:17,070
It is freedom which is ahead of you.

1182
02:38:22,270 --> 02:38:26,480
The lullabies sung by mothers of this land
have stories of braveries filled in them.

1183
02:38:27,940 --> 02:38:31,110
War happened on this land took form into a Puranam (Epic).

1184
02:38:31,270 --> 02:38:34,570
Blood spilled on this land took form into an Itihaasam (Epic).

1185
02:38:38,070 --> 02:38:40,820
We are the ones who taught salvation to the world...

1186
02:38:40,980 --> 02:38:43,110
now we’ll teach them what Liberation is.

1187
02:38:46,440 --> 02:38:51,070
We taught them ‘life’, now lets teach them Freedom.

1188
02:38:53,980 --> 02:39:01,320
Lets chase the whites away, who have been looting
our mother’s milk by slashing their heads.

1189
02:39:04,650 --> 02:39:08,980
The ultimate goal for every human
on this land should be only one thing...

1190
02:39:09,150 --> 02:39:12,820
Freedom... Freedom... Freedom.

1191
02:39:15,190 --> 02:39:20,110
A warrior’s life lost for the cause of
that Freedom will take shape of a war.

1192
02:39:20,150 --> 02:39:22,150
From now, I’m the war.

1193
02:39:24,480 --> 02:39:28,440
Body burnt for freedom will take shape of a country.

1194
02:39:28,440 --> 02:39:30,570
From now, I’m the country.

1195
02:39:32,270 --> 02:39:38,190
Celebrate this day on which I’m hanged,
make it a grand festival.

1196
02:39:39,690 --> 02:39:44,570
It’s not my death which is happening here but birth...

1197
02:39:50,360 --> 02:39:54,190
a birth to the nation mother India.

1198
02:39:54,190 --> 02:39:58,440
Hail Mother India...

1199
02:40:07,440 --> 02:40:10,230
Hail Mother India....

1200
02:40:10,270 --> 02:40:14,230
Hail Mother India...

1201
02:40:14,230 --> 02:40:16,320
[Slogans continue..]

1202
02:40:37,770 --> 02:40:40,270
Hang him

1203
02:40:57,480 --> 02:40:59,820
Hang him

1204
02:42:58,150 --> 02:43:00,190
Narasimha!

1205
02:43:07,480 --> 02:43:10,570
Narasimha Reddy...

1206
02:43:13,070 --> 02:43:15,070
Narasimha Reddy...

1207
02:43:15,230 --> 02:43:19,730
I gave you birth by giving you my blood
and you have returned the same blood back to this mother.

1208
02:43:19,860 --> 02:43:23,980
from every drop of your blood a new
Narasimha Reddy will be born.

1209
02:43:24,070 --> 02:43:27,070
Your dream for freedom will come true.

1210
02:43:27,320 --> 02:43:29,480
Syeraa Narasimha Reddy

1211
02:43:34,270 --> 02:43:37,230
Syeraa Narasimha Reddy

1212
02:43:38,610 --> 02:43:41,570
Syeraa Narasimha Reddy

1213
02:43:52,650 --> 02:43:57,400
Any war ends with it's leader’s death...

1214
02:43:58,190 --> 02:44:03,320
but this war has begun with your death...

1215
02:44:03,520 --> 02:44:06,980
This won’t stop. You've won Narasimha

1216
02:44:16,400 --> 02:44:19,440
This war is the breath left by Narasimha Reddy.

1217
02:44:19,440 --> 02:44:20,860
Shall we stop?

1218
02:44:22,730 --> 02:44:27,230
In every soldier’s weapon here we have Narasimha Reddy’s soul.

1219
02:44:27,230 --> 02:44:30,360
Shall we let it go...?
- Let us achieve! Let us achieve!

1220
02:44:30,860 --> 02:44:32,520
Let us achieve! Let us achieve!

1221
02:44:32,520 --> 02:44:33,730
Our destination?

1222
02:44:33,730 --> 02:44:36,360
Independence... Independence... Independence...

1223
02:44:55,320 --> 02:45:06,980
As a sign of warning to Indians who fight for freedom, they hanged
Uyyalawada Narasimha reddy's head to fort entrance for 30 years

1224
02:45:07,440 --> 02:45:09,730
But the Inspiration he has given hasn't been stopped.

1225
02:45:09,820 --> 02:45:16,730
thousands and lakhs of people have revolted and fought relentlessly for
an Independent India over a course of 10 decades.

1226
02:45:16,730 --> 02:45:33,940
It was the result of those sacrifices our Mother India was freed from the chains of
slavery on 15th August 1947 breathing freedom;

1227
02:45:33,940 --> 02:45:37,480
Let’s respect Indianness and let’s feel proud as Indians.

1228
02:45:38,190 --> 02:45:41,360
Nation becomes your speech.

1229
02:45:42,270 --> 02:45:45,900
Nation becomes your sword.

1230
02:45:47,770 --> 02:45:51,690
Nation becomes your footsteps.

1231
02:45:51,980 --> 02:45:55,860
It will talk about your glory,
even beyond your time

1232
02:45:55,860 --> 02:45:59,230
You are your country.

1233
02:46:00,730 --> 02:46:03,570
You are our tomorrow.

1234
02:46:05,230 --> 02:46:08,610
You are your country.

1235
02:46:10,110 --> 02:46:12,940
You are our tomorrow.

1236
02:46:52,440 --> 02:47:00,480
You were born, you stood up...
You lost your roots.

1237
02:47:01,940 --> 02:47:10,150
You sharpened your sword...
on your heart that was a rock.

1238
02:47:11,610 --> 02:47:20,020
In the jungle of battle...
Like a lion you stood.

1239
02:47:20,940 --> 02:47:28,820
You lit the fire in our hearts to fight.

1240
02:47:31,110 --> 02:47:39,650
You gave your life for us...
You fluttered as our flag in the wind.

1241
02:47:43,400 --> 02:47:46,650
You are your country.

1242
02:47:48,730 --> 02:47:51,570
You are our tomorrow.

1243
02:47:53,150 --> 02:47:58,400
You are your country.

1244
02:47:58,400 --> 02:48:01,270
You are our tomorrow.

1245
02:48:02,690 --> 02:48:07,940
You are your country.

1246
02:48:07,940 --> 02:48:10,820
You are our tomorrow.

1247
02:48:12,320 --> 02:48:16,770
