1
00:01:45,266 --> 00:01:48,594
This is that part of Afghanistan
where the people...

2
00:01:48,896 --> 00:01:53,814
...comprise of 2 tribes that
are bitterest of enemies.

3
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:59,947
Like every year; today, the tribes
are meeting for a local sport.

4
00:02:01,118 --> 00:02:06,467
It may be considered a sport, but
it's no less than a brutal war!

5
00:02:07,444 --> 00:02:13,963
The tribe who lifts the goat, and
takes it to a certain point, wins.

6
00:02:14,837 --> 00:02:21,561
Every rider, in an effort to win
strikes the foe so horribly...

7
00:02:21,664 --> 00:02:26,889
...as though it's a question of
life and death, and not a game!

8
00:02:55,231 --> 00:02:58,457
Victory is ours, Badshah Khan.

9
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:57,013
What have you done? Turned
a victory into a defeat!

10
00:09:57,687 --> 00:09:59,710
I'm struck by lightning.

11
00:10:01,116 --> 00:10:03,742
I've not lost a contest,
but my life itself!

12
00:10:06,544 --> 00:10:09,566
You've always solved my problems.

13
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:15,291
Solve this one too.
How do I win her?

14
00:10:15,802 --> 00:10:20,323
- There's only one way to win her.
- What's that? - Death!

15
00:18:26,957 --> 00:18:30,911
Your actions make me mad, and...

16
00:18:32,086 --> 00:18:35,311
...and surprise me too!
This madness of yours...

17
00:18:35,312 --> 00:18:38,195
...could prove to be a
lesson to both the tribes.

18
00:18:39,903 --> 00:18:43,228
My war's with beauty,
not the tribe, Benazir.

19
00:18:43,961 --> 00:18:47,582
His tongue wags too much!
It must be cut off.

20
00:18:48,285 --> 00:18:53,265
Before you do that, I'll cut your
sword in so many pieces...

21
00:18:53,473 --> 00:18:56,700
...that you'll spend your
lifetime, in gathering them all.

22
00:18:56,701 --> 00:19:01,385
An answer to an ignorant is silence!

23
00:19:04,917 --> 00:19:07,278
You call me an ignoramus?

24
00:19:11,404 --> 00:19:15,352
Benazir, I'll marry you.

25
00:19:17,357 --> 00:19:21,476
- That's impossible!
- I'll make the impossible, possible.

26
00:19:22,048 --> 00:19:25,633
- For this you'll have to sieve
grains of sand in India. - Fine.

27
00:19:26,007 --> 00:19:31,758
- What madness! - You'll have to
bring the head of my father's killer.

28
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:36,140
- I'll get it for you.
- Careful now. - In this test...

29
00:19:36,384 --> 00:19:40,763
...you may lose your life.
- I've already lost that to you.

30
00:19:41,574 --> 00:19:47,655
If you do that, then...
I'll be yours.

31
00:19:48,891 --> 00:19:53,544
Benazir... you are already mine!

32
00:20:01,198 --> 00:20:02,959
May Lord fulfill your wish.

33
00:20:24,516 --> 00:20:31,266
Son, your friend is going faraway,
and you're keeping silent?

34
00:20:31,602 --> 00:20:37,218
Stop him, else he'll die
in trying to search that killer.

35
00:20:37,457 --> 00:20:41,945
Nothing new in it. What
kind of love is it...

36
00:20:41,946 --> 00:20:46,202
...which isn't sacrificed
for love? And which moth...

37
00:20:46,438 --> 00:20:51,622
...doesn't kill himself on
a flame? Am I right or not?

38
00:20:51,626 --> 00:20:56,641
Come on, my dear friend...

39
00:20:56,916 --> 00:21:00,830
I'm going so far away, and
you get cross with me?

40
00:21:01,008 --> 00:21:04,831
Do you take me to be
a statue of stone?

41
00:21:05,365 --> 00:21:08,621
You're inviting death, and you
ask your friend to embrace you?

42
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:14,236
Dear friend, the heavens
decide about life and death.

43
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:20,162
Don't think so seriously. If you
do that, it weakens the decisions.

44
00:21:20,432 --> 00:21:25,187
India is a huge country.
Your destination is miles away.

45
00:21:26,221 --> 00:21:29,942
Look through my eyes. There
stands my destination.

46
00:21:30,346 --> 00:21:32,037
At the feet of Benazir.

47
00:21:38,814 --> 00:21:43,127
Khan, take a good look at
the killer's photograph.

48
00:21:43,462 --> 00:21:48,038
Don't bring an ass's head,
in a hurry to win Benazir!

49
00:21:48,044 --> 00:21:49,562
- You swine!
- Keep quiet!

50
00:21:57,206 --> 00:22:03,774
If I wanted to present an
ass's head to Benazir...

51
00:22:04,378 --> 00:22:08,159
...l'd have cut your head off
a long time ago!

52
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:18,851
- I don't think you'll return!
- If God...

53
00:22:18,852 --> 00:22:21,966
...wills light, then lamps
burn even in storms!

54
00:22:22,171 --> 00:22:27,277
- I beg your leave, my beloved.
- May God keep you, Khan.

55
00:22:29,447 --> 00:22:33,517
- Just a question of a smile.
- It'll be difficult.

56
00:22:34,351 --> 00:22:37,262
Ease that difficulty
for me then.

57
00:22:38,069 --> 00:22:42,815
I won't go without it.
Just one smile.

58
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:48,590
Broader...

59
00:22:53,273 --> 00:22:54,758
A bit more broader...

60
00:22:58,052 --> 00:22:59,909
Slightly more now...

61
00:23:04,625 --> 00:23:07,105
Wonderful, dear friend.

62
00:23:10,467 --> 00:23:13,615
Sacrifice!

63
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:22,972
Symbol of love!
In the name of beauty!

64
00:23:30,814 --> 00:23:37,608
Whenever you look at this
flag, you'll touch me.

65
00:23:38,815 --> 00:23:44,522
Whenever it flutters, you'll hear
my heart beating in yours.

66
00:23:45,123 --> 00:23:48,565
Whenever your delicate hands
touch this flag...

67
00:23:49,471 --> 00:23:52,983
...their fragrance
will reach my soul.

68
00:23:53,455 --> 00:23:55,279
Goodbye, Benazir.

69
00:23:58,169 --> 00:24:03,612
Goodbye, dear friend.
Goodbye, Kabul!

70
00:24:03,613 --> 00:24:08,857
Goodbye... Goodbye...

71
00:25:24,847 --> 00:25:29,594
O land of India...
Greetings to you.

72
00:25:33,617 --> 00:25:39,983
My name's Badshah Khan.
Love is my faith...

73
00:25:41,455 --> 00:25:44,143
Love is my religion.

74
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:51,047
Love! for which Farhad...

75
00:25:51,321 --> 00:25:55,366
...cut open the mountains, and
got milk to flow from them!

76
00:25:56,402 --> 00:26:04,606
Love!... for which Majnu searched
every grain of sand in a storm.

77
00:26:04,807 --> 00:26:07,787
For that very love,
this Pathan from Kabul...

78
00:26:07,929 --> 00:26:12,076
...has come to this soil of
India to acquire that love.

79
00:26:14,572 --> 00:26:18,118
It's a trying test.

80
00:26:19,786 --> 00:26:25,155
A difficult test. But
the confidence is strong!

81
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:31,601
Love has always been victorious.

82
00:26:33,005 --> 00:26:37,118
It's been so for centuries.
And it'll always be so too!

83
00:26:37,754 --> 00:26:39,670
God is witness.

84
00:26:49,047 --> 00:26:53,454
For one whole year,
in search of Habibulla...

85
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:58,012
...Badshah Khan left no
stone unturned in India...

86
00:26:58,846 --> 00:27:01,667
But he was unsuccessful.

87
00:27:05,687 --> 00:27:11,158
Forget him, Benazir. Nobody
returns from the jaws of death!

88
00:27:12,132 --> 00:27:16,414
He won't find Habibullah.
And even if he does...

89
00:27:17,479 --> 00:27:23,288
...Habib's brother, will chop
your Khan to pieces. Forget him!

90
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:26,404
He has let you down!

91
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:35,373
Why did you do that?

92
00:27:36,976 --> 00:27:39,491
You've fanned a dormant fire.

93
00:27:41,126 --> 00:27:44,276
I had come with the intention
of proposing to you.

94
00:27:46,873 --> 00:27:50,092
Now I'll put my seal
to that intention.

95
00:28:13,312 --> 00:28:15,034
I sent the swine to hell!

96
00:28:21,947 --> 00:28:23,669
It's a whole year now.

97
00:28:25,933 --> 00:28:30,979
There's no news about Badshah.
He will come, won't he?

98
00:28:30,979 --> 00:28:35,195
He's gone like a storm, he'll
return as one! And when he does...

99
00:28:35,931 --> 00:28:38,808
...l'll not call you Benazir...
but "sister-in-law"!

100
00:29:00,341 --> 00:29:04,748
- May God keep you, Badshah.
- Same to you, dear boy.

101
00:29:05,124 --> 00:29:10,205
- How do you know my name?
- Mummy says, a customer is a guest.

102
00:29:10,206 --> 00:29:13,355
And every guest should be served
like a " Badshah", a king!

103
00:29:13,693 --> 00:29:18,903
That's a noble thought. Your
mother guides you well.

104
00:29:18,973 --> 00:29:23,947
- Greetings brother. - Greetings.
- Badshah, this is my mother.

105
00:29:25,949 --> 00:29:29,665
- My respects. - You called me
"brother", I'm very glad.

106
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:35,137
By God! I'm really happy.
I don't have a sister, that's why.

107
00:29:36,478 --> 00:29:41,485
I also don't have a brother. May
God bless this relation. Come in.

108
00:29:43,021 --> 00:29:45,276
Greetings, Habibullah Khan.

109
00:30:00,191 --> 00:30:04,372
Forgive me. I took
you for somebody else.

110
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:08,891
Sorry. I thought you
were somebody else.

111
00:30:30,815 --> 00:30:32,402
Why have you come here?

112
00:30:36,429 --> 00:30:40,269
- To meet my son.
- I won't let you, in this state.

113
00:30:41,544 --> 00:30:45,022
My son is sleeping with such
a dream in his eyes...

114
00:30:45,461 --> 00:30:49,971
...in which you are an honest,
righteous person. I won't...

115
00:30:49,979 --> 00:30:52,065
...let you spoil
that dream of his!

116
00:30:57,154 --> 00:31:02,060
I'll die, but I won't let your
evil shadow fall on my son!

117
00:31:02,204 --> 00:31:06,746
- He'll live like a human, not
an animal like you! - Animal?

118
00:31:07,316 --> 00:31:08,971
You call me an animal?

119
00:31:13,496 --> 00:31:17,834
Shame on you, you devil!
You strike a woman?

120
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:21,525
Who's he? Your lover-boy?

121
00:31:25,054 --> 00:31:28,702
You swine! You call
a brother, a lover?

122
00:31:29,305 --> 00:31:30,892
A lover?

123
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:38,003
You call him a lover?

124
00:31:40,963 --> 00:31:43,446
You lifted your hand at me?
An officer?

125
00:31:44,285 --> 00:31:49,462
- I'll have you arrested in 2 days.
- How can you do that to a good man?

126
00:31:49,832 --> 00:31:53,882
Now get lost. Go on... Out!

127
00:31:53,883 --> 00:31:55,866
Better go, else I'll debone you!

128
00:31:56,276 --> 00:31:58,723
- I'll show you!
- What will you show me?

129
00:32:06,107 --> 00:32:07,796
Go, sister. Go.

130
00:32:09,362 --> 00:32:14,232
He won't come here again.
Pray to the Lord and sleep.

131
00:32:28,558 --> 00:32:32,876
No noose on earth
can reach my neck...

132
00:32:33,377 --> 00:32:39,187
...while my brother is living.
He'll take me out of this cage.

133
00:32:40,221 --> 00:32:43,536
His name is Pasha.

134
00:33:07,450 --> 00:33:10,539
My God! This area is as terrible...

135
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:15,585
...as the man who owns it! The
name too is apt. " Burial ground".

136
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:04,895
This is the pigeon who challenged
me and held his head high!

137
00:34:05,005 --> 00:34:10,649
He looked in my eyes!
I was betrayed! Betrayed.

138
00:34:10,889 --> 00:34:16,864
- But I didn't do any treachery.
- My brother's in your jail.

139
00:34:17,334 --> 00:34:21,512
Did you allow him to escape?
No! Well, that's betrayal!

140
00:34:23,747 --> 00:34:26,002
The rest is all fine.

141
00:34:31,118 --> 00:34:35,561
What's fine, Pasha? You men
are piling earth on me.

142
00:34:35,704 --> 00:34:40,882
I tried my best to help him escape
but the jailer kept a tight security.

143
00:34:41,052 --> 00:34:47,293
- I want my brother! - I'll sneak in
4 of your men in the police guard.

144
00:34:47,828 --> 00:34:52,700
I'll steal the uniforms, and you
shoot down the jailer from afar.

145
00:34:52,744 --> 00:34:56,223
- That'll be fun.
- Your brother will then escape.

146
00:34:58,556 --> 00:35:01,378
Take him out.

147
00:35:33,368 --> 00:35:37,648
Don't defy fate.
Forget Habibullah...

148
00:35:37,851 --> 00:35:42,758
...and go back home.
- My dear sister...

149
00:35:44,595 --> 00:35:49,042
A spent arrow, a falling star...

150
00:35:49,618 --> 00:35:53,395
...and a spoken word, never return.

151
00:35:56,652 --> 00:36:00,063
Habibullah's found. See this.
He's jailed here.

152
00:36:06,118 --> 00:36:10,130
Dear child, you brought
Habibullah to me.

153
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:17,568
You've obliged me greatly.
And I'll never forget it. Never!

154
00:37:07,536 --> 00:37:11,580
- Who are you?
- I'm Badshah Khan, from Kabul.

155
00:37:11,754 --> 00:37:15,731
- What do you want? - Habib's
head! - This is a Br. Jail.

156
00:37:17,136 --> 00:37:20,853
Not a cage in Kabul to hand
over a fowl or a goat to you!

157
00:37:22,118 --> 00:37:26,864
You son of a gun! Why do
you talk nonsense?

158
00:37:27,232 --> 00:37:30,315
I'm a Pathan. I'm not used
to being talked to impudently!

159
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:35,835
I'm a Rajput too, Khan.
I'm also not used to it!

160
00:37:35,936 --> 00:37:41,111
Rajputs are courageous men too.
Then talk like a Rajput.

161
00:37:41,283 --> 00:37:45,997
- Bring that useless being out.
I want his head. - He's not a goat...

162
00:37:46,167 --> 00:37:48,987
...for you to carry him away
on the tip of your sword from here!

163
00:37:49,088 --> 00:37:54,526
Every convict is my responsibility,
who either serves his term fully...

164
00:37:54,671 --> 00:37:58,953
...or dies! - Before he became
a wanted man in your country...

165
00:37:58,954 --> 00:38:03,996
...he's wanted in mine! My nation
and this sword will, punish him!

166
00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:10,248
Khan, Habibullah has already
got his punishment.

167
00:38:11,113 --> 00:38:14,828
Tomorrow, he'll be hanged
before dawn, in public...

168
00:38:14,832 --> 00:38:16,917
...in the village square.

169
00:38:21,176 --> 00:38:23,692
Then; by God's Holy
word, O Rajput Khan...

170
00:38:24,598 --> 00:38:29,436
...either this Pathan will take
him back, or the sun will not rise!

171
00:40:16,405 --> 00:40:20,414
Wonderful! How you defeated
Death, by saving me!

172
00:40:20,589 --> 00:40:25,133
My brother will reward you of course
but I too will reward you. Shake!

173
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:32,507
You goon! Life wishes to
shake hands with death!

174
00:40:33,211 --> 00:40:37,687
- Death? Death is miles behind us.
- It's in front of you too, rascal.

175
00:40:38,127 --> 00:40:41,141
- What do you mean by that?
- Justice!

176
00:40:41,482 --> 00:40:45,098
- What justice? - By stabbing
Benazir's father in the back...

177
00:40:45,634 --> 00:40:50,641
...you brought enmity in the two
tribes. I'm hoping to change that.

178
00:40:51,613 --> 00:40:53,528
By severing your head!

179
00:41:12,174 --> 00:41:14,894
Don't worry, Habib.
Don't you worry.

180
00:41:18,950 --> 00:41:21,738
Why do you wish to kill my brother?

181
00:41:24,731 --> 00:41:27,608
Pasha, I think he too
is Benazir's lover-boy.

182
00:41:27,686 --> 00:41:32,400
He wants to kill me and win her.
Shoot him! Kill him!

183
00:41:32,569 --> 00:41:35,515
Shut up! Kill him, indeed!
Put your rifles down.

184
00:41:38,979 --> 00:41:42,594
This Pathan is our friend.
One of us.

185
00:41:43,265 --> 00:41:46,879
- Who are you, Pathan?
- Who are you?

186
00:41:47,052 --> 00:41:49,432
At your service, Pathan!

187
00:41:51,437 --> 00:41:55,447
And name? A small one. Pasha.

188
00:41:56,253 --> 00:42:02,064
But I do very dangerous deeds.

189
00:42:02,697 --> 00:42:07,807
- Hey you! This is my prey.

190
00:42:08,311 --> 00:42:12,061
- Forget him! Else...
- Else what? - Else, not one...

191
00:42:12,197 --> 00:42:14,678
...but 2 heads will be severed.

192
00:42:17,345 --> 00:42:20,993
Better worry about your own head.

193
00:42:21,531 --> 00:42:26,176
Better show your back and go.
Else your head will fly to Kabul!

194
00:42:26,678 --> 00:42:28,097
Damn you!

195
00:42:38,471 --> 00:42:41,190
Not his, my head.
You talked too much, eh?

196
00:42:41,526 --> 00:42:45,808
Why don't you speak now?
Go on, talk.

197
00:44:55,554 --> 00:44:57,141
Talk!

198
00:46:31,849 --> 00:46:36,032
Thank you very much.
You saved my life.

199
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:42,767
I'll be obliged to you.
Okay then. Goodbye.

200
00:46:46,696 --> 00:46:51,035
- What's this?
- Handcuffs. To arrest you.

201
00:46:53,107 --> 00:46:57,786
Oh God! You save my life,
and you'll handcuff me too?

202
00:46:58,487 --> 00:47:03,394
I saved you, as a fellow being.
But it's my duty to arrest you.

203
00:47:03,671 --> 00:47:07,456
- What duty? - In the eyes of our
law, you've committed a crime.

204
00:47:07,592 --> 00:47:09,109
What law?

205
00:47:11,974 --> 00:47:15,419
Your law was to hang him.
He was to die anyway.

206
00:47:15,761 --> 00:47:19,444
- You didn't kill him, I did.
We're quits. - That's your crime.

207
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:30,705
Rajput Khan, I'll take
his body to Kabul.

208
00:47:31,604 --> 00:47:34,257
Nobody can stop me. Nobody!

209
00:47:34,395 --> 00:47:40,602
A Rajput stands before you.
He too knows how to bid.

210
00:47:42,168 --> 00:47:46,608
- Sorry I can't permit you to go.
- I didn't ask you permission.

211
00:47:47,051 --> 00:47:50,235
- I just told you my decision.
- Then I too have spoken of my duty.

212
00:47:51,203 --> 00:47:54,488
It's better if our
principles don't clash.

213
00:47:54,824 --> 00:48:00,226
Because of this traitor, our 2
clans have become bitter enemies.

214
00:48:01,266 --> 00:48:05,108
He's a murderer. He killed
Benazir's father...

215
00:48:05,153 --> 00:48:08,633
...and sowed seeds of enmity
in our tribes. - Who's Benazir?

216
00:48:09,969 --> 00:48:15,974
She... who has become a
part of Badshah's heart.

217
00:48:17,841 --> 00:48:22,058
If I take this corpse to her,
she'll accept me.

218
00:48:23,389 --> 00:48:27,604
- That was her promise.
- No, Badshah. No.

219
00:48:28,605 --> 00:48:32,184
- My duty forbids you from
doing this. - Look Rajput Khan...

220
00:48:33,519 --> 00:48:35,403
Try to understand me.

221
00:48:37,673 --> 00:48:41,421
If I go back, our 2 clans
will come together again.

222
00:48:41,690 --> 00:48:45,565
There'll be peace. Hatred
will turn into friendship.

223
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:50,126
I'll be able to wed Benazir.

224
00:49:01,654 --> 00:49:03,275
Look, Rajput Khan.

225
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:07,390
I give you my word.

226
00:49:09,361 --> 00:49:15,898
Let me go now. I'll come back
to you within 30 days.

227
00:49:17,299 --> 00:49:19,520
You can do your duty then.

228
00:49:21,219 --> 00:49:27,053
This is a word of a Pathan.
A Pathan.

229
00:49:30,918 --> 00:49:34,568
Okay. You may go, Badshah.

230
00:49:35,601 --> 00:49:39,046
Go for now. But, remember...

231
00:49:40,351 --> 00:49:42,574
A Rajput has trusted a Pathan.

232
00:49:43,873 --> 00:49:47,985
30 days from today,
we'll meet again.

233
00:49:52,242 --> 00:50:02,869
Long live Badshah Khan.

234
00:50:06,856 --> 00:50:08,377
Sister-in-law!

235
00:50:11,475 --> 00:50:15,519
Dear Lord! You called
me sister-in-law?

236
00:50:15,726 --> 00:50:18,842
Yes. He has come back.
Badshah Khan is here.

237
00:59:10,981 --> 00:59:14,027
In this very place;
In this very earth...

238
00:59:15,197 --> 00:59:17,949
...hadn't Badshah Khan spilt
my brother's blood?

239
00:59:19,446 --> 00:59:23,194
Remember this spot.
Never forget it.

240
00:59:24,391 --> 00:59:27,833
I too shall spill that bastard's
blood in this very earth!

241
00:59:38,697 --> 00:59:43,770
This line is the border line
of Badshah Khan's life.

242
00:59:45,172 --> 00:59:49,486
He shall repay my brother's
life with his own!

243
00:59:50,846 --> 00:59:53,597
Everything else is fine.

244
01:00:04,523 --> 01:00:08,969
Badshah, if you don't keep
your word just once...

245
01:00:09,714 --> 01:00:12,832
...what difference will it make?

246
01:00:15,928 --> 01:00:20,773
Benazir... How can
you say that, love?

247
01:00:21,850 --> 01:00:24,571
Being a tiger's cub,
you talk so cowardly?

248
01:00:27,036 --> 01:00:29,919
You know very well that
I'm not a coward.

249
01:00:30,430 --> 01:00:34,444
But, what can I do?
I'm so very scared.

250
01:00:35,316 --> 01:00:41,100
That this separation may not drive
me mad! How do I convince my heart?

251
01:00:41,637 --> 01:00:48,508
Control it. Convince it. There's
something beyond the heart too.

252
01:00:49,748 --> 01:00:54,161
One who can betray his own word,
can betray anyone.

253
01:00:54,471 --> 01:00:59,719
Even God, or you too.
Treachery is a crime, sweetheart.

254
01:01:00,389 --> 01:01:03,304
I don't mind this crime.

255
01:01:04,213 --> 01:01:07,470
For your Benazir,
commit this crime too.

256
01:01:08,307 --> 01:01:16,018
For you I can commit 100 crimes,
but then, I won't remain myself.

257
01:01:17,052 --> 01:01:19,071
I'll die of shame.

258
01:01:20,309 --> 01:01:25,990
That courageous Rajput,
trusted this Pathan's word.

259
01:01:27,257 --> 01:01:30,581
And I should break my own word?

260
01:01:34,210 --> 01:01:40,026
Take this dagger, and thrust it
in this ungrateful being's heart.

261
01:01:44,451 --> 01:01:46,005
For God's sake!

262
01:01:50,868 --> 01:01:52,627
Don't say such things.

263
01:07:06,648 --> 01:07:10,689
Badshah Khan, we're quits now.

264
01:07:13,948 --> 01:07:19,484
Jailer, Ranvir Singh. The Sun
will set in 5 minutes.

265
01:07:20,818 --> 01:07:24,823
And with it will set, the time
limit of 30 days you gave.

266
01:07:26,025 --> 01:07:30,068
In the eyes of the law,
you too will be a criminal.

267
01:07:32,530 --> 01:07:36,674
There's still a distance of 5 mins.
between the truth and a lie.

268
01:07:37,340 --> 01:07:42,410
How can 5 minutes bridge a gap,
that wasn't bridged in 30 days?

269
01:07:43,547 --> 01:07:47,880
Aziz Mirza. Badshah Khan is a man.

270
01:07:48,688 --> 01:07:51,543
He'll give his life, but
he'll never betray.

271
01:07:53,036 --> 01:07:59,205
And, even a moment is enough,
for luck to turn the table!

272
01:08:13,342 --> 01:08:18,376
Better remove your pips.
That Pathan has betrayed you.

273
01:08:43,082 --> 01:08:48,144
A Pathan has kept his word.

274
01:08:49,941 --> 01:08:51,956
Here, sir.

275
01:08:54,719 --> 01:08:59,553
This is called a "Rakhi".
My wife has tied it on your wrist.

276
01:09:00,161 --> 01:09:03,772
We Indian ladies tie this
on our brother's wrist.

277
01:09:04,209 --> 01:09:08,418
- And they protect our marriage
from harm. - Which you have.

278
01:09:09,850 --> 01:09:12,531
You've saved a Rajput
from humiliation.

279
01:09:14,165 --> 01:09:18,306
What nonsense you talk. That
two-penny worth Pasha...

280
01:09:18,707 --> 01:09:23,847
Had he beheaded me, I'd have
come with my head in my hand!

281
01:10:08,647 --> 01:10:14,321
What an illness love is!
No hope of her husband's return.

282
01:10:14,322 --> 01:10:17,536
Yet she lights lamps
everyday, and awaits him.

283
01:10:17,837 --> 01:10:23,304
She has no sense of day,
or night, the crazy girl.

284
01:10:38,809 --> 01:10:42,453
What news do you have?
When is my Badshah coming?

285
01:10:43,055 --> 01:10:47,729
- After 5 years!
- 5 years?

286
01:10:50,123 --> 01:10:53,530
Why? Why? Why not today?

287
01:10:54,600 --> 01:10:58,843
- Why not?
- The Indian law...

288
01:10:59,310 --> 01:11:03,816
...has proved him to be a
criminal and sentenced him.

289
01:11:08,932 --> 01:11:13,741
Sentenced him?
Punished a lover?

290
01:11:15,534 --> 01:11:19,901
Doesn't India have a heart?
Hasn't it heard of Love?

291
01:11:21,670 --> 01:11:24,816
I had heard that India
is an ocean of love.

292
01:11:25,682 --> 01:11:30,889
Why didn't they think? How can
two lovers live without each other?

293
01:11:31,391 --> 01:11:36,256
A thousand days and nights,
without my beloved Badshah?

294
01:11:37,461 --> 01:11:41,434
O God! Why did you do this?

295
01:11:42,472 --> 01:11:48,964
Why? Why?

296
01:15:45,177 --> 01:15:49,979
Give alms to the poor.
Your sister-in-law is pregnant.

297
01:15:50,185 --> 01:15:54,001
- Your Badshah Khan will be
a father soon. - God's grace.

298
01:16:58,591 --> 01:17:02,040
Have some sweet-meats.
Our jailer is blessed with a child.

299
01:17:02,251 --> 01:17:06,746
Yes. A girl. And I christened her.

300
01:17:06,747 --> 01:17:10,802
Give me that. I'll distribute it
for my friend's joy. - What joy?

301
01:17:11,211 --> 01:17:16,602
- Hurry up and tell me.
- You've become a father, friend.

302
01:17:16,603 --> 01:17:19,464
Congratulations!

303
01:17:22,463 --> 01:17:27,688
- Father! - And coincidentally,
on my daughter's birthday...

304
01:17:27,692 --> 01:17:30,279
...your Benazir has given
birth to another Benazir.

305
01:17:31,588 --> 01:17:35,210
- What are you saying?
- It's true, Badshah.

306
01:17:38,545 --> 01:17:42,393
What have you named my daughter?

307
01:17:42,840 --> 01:17:47,101
- Hena. - And do you know
what I've named your daughter?

308
01:17:47,403 --> 01:17:51,390
- How will I know?
- The same name in Hindi.

309
01:17:53,195 --> 01:17:54,617
Mehndi?

310
01:19:39,911 --> 01:19:42,464
Hello! I'm here. How do I look?

311
01:19:42,771 --> 01:19:47,569
- Wonderful! Lovely!
- Come with me. - Where?

312
01:19:47,804 --> 01:19:52,435
- To play. - Oh! I can't come.
- You won't come, eh?

313
01:19:52,436 --> 01:19:54,322
I won't listen to you anymore!

314
01:20:15,358 --> 01:20:19,657
Jailer Ranvir Singh...
I have your daughter.

315
01:20:19,759 --> 01:20:25,519
If you want to see her alive,
handover Badshah Khan to me.

316
01:20:34,219 --> 01:20:37,706
O Rajput Khan.
You're a funny father!

317
01:20:37,915 --> 01:20:42,576
He has kidnapped your child and
you sit here. Order me...

318
01:20:42,847 --> 01:20:46,146
I'll stake my life and bring
Hena darling. I'll bring her.

319
01:20:47,380 --> 01:20:52,108
I can also go and get my daughter.

320
01:20:53,582 --> 01:20:57,843
- But I'm held back by my duty.
- What duty are you taking about?

321
01:20:58,013 --> 01:21:03,267
Which holds back a father from
saving his own daughter. Tell me.

322
01:21:05,344 --> 01:21:09,199
That duty which is expected of
a jailer towards his convict.

323
01:21:10,111 --> 01:21:17,139
That duty which is between 2 pals.
How can I risk my friend's life...

324
01:21:17,140 --> 01:21:20,440
What are you hiding there?
Give it to me. Come on.

325
01:21:30,303 --> 01:21:32,465
They want me, and you...

326
01:21:36,570 --> 01:21:41,128
Okay. Badshah Khan will himself
come to you, you curs!

327
01:21:41,203 --> 01:21:44,658
No! No, Khan.

328
01:21:44,701 --> 01:21:48,066
- I won't let you go.
- What are you saying?

329
01:21:49,234 --> 01:21:52,566
If I don't go, those fiends
will kill my darling girl.

330
01:21:53,964 --> 01:21:58,296
Khan, I'll not agree to
a life for a life.

331
01:22:00,064 --> 01:22:04,193
In 4 days, you'll be a
free man to go back home.

332
01:22:04,566 --> 01:22:09,757
Damn you! Isn't this my home?
This is my home too.

333
01:22:10,062 --> 01:22:15,555
Hena is my child too, and,
I'll die willingly for her.

334
01:22:15,793 --> 01:22:19,091
Look Khan... I...

335
01:22:23,325 --> 01:22:28,849
I'll not allow you to buy death
for my daughter's life. No!

336
01:22:37,715 --> 01:22:43,138
For a friend, you're willing
to sacrifice your daughter?

337
01:22:45,148 --> 01:22:49,073
What do take me for?
What do you think I am?

338
01:22:49,449 --> 01:22:53,139
Will I be able to live with
such a huge burden? I'll die!

339
01:22:54,678 --> 01:23:00,541
- Get aside. That child needs me.
- No fuss. I won't let you go.

340
01:23:00,542 --> 01:23:04,869
- Get aside. God forbid, but if
something happens, it'll be the end.

341
01:23:11,206 --> 01:23:14,624
Forgive me, friend.
Don't get me wrong.

342
01:23:15,670 --> 01:23:18,291
But it's my duty to keep you
within these walls.

343
01:23:19,098 --> 01:23:23,228
And I forget all other relations,
where my duty is concerned.

344
01:23:23,497 --> 01:23:28,653
- Forgive me. - This Pathan too
can forget anything before duty.

345
01:23:30,030 --> 01:23:33,486
Rajput Khan... forgive me.

346
01:23:50,358 --> 01:23:54,277
- Khan Uncle. - My dear girl.
- Hold on, Khan.

347
01:23:54,619 --> 01:23:59,573
You dare! Else before we severe
your head, I'll behead her!

348
01:24:00,814 --> 01:24:03,875
- Save me, Khan Uncle.
- You fiend!

349
01:24:04,646 --> 01:24:09,604
You kidnapped an innocent kid to
seek revenge on me! Shameless!

350
01:24:09,978 --> 01:24:12,501
One has to achieve one's aim
by hook or by crook!

351
01:24:12,910 --> 01:24:18,002
Throw that sword away.
Go on, throw it!

352
01:24:25,672 --> 01:24:28,539
Now it'll be a confrontation
on equal terms.

353
01:24:31,071 --> 01:24:35,095
You're unarmed, and so am I!

354
01:24:44,131 --> 01:24:46,256
Pick up the dagger. Go on.

355
01:25:25,582 --> 01:25:28,943
- Mercy! Mercy, Pasha.
- Not mercy, Khan.

356
01:25:29,443 --> 01:25:32,865
Your neck! A neck for a neck!

357
01:25:32,876 --> 01:25:34,708
Mercy, Pasha, Mercy!

358
01:25:38,144 --> 01:25:41,268
Let my kid go!
Else I'll have your head!

359
01:25:41,507 --> 01:25:45,131
Let the child go!
Let her go, I said!

360
01:25:45,202 --> 01:25:48,002
Leave the girl.

361
01:25:57,932 --> 01:26:01,423
- Nobody move!
- Rajput Khan! You?

362
01:26:01,766 --> 01:26:06,991
- Don't worry. I'm here now.
- You see to your daughter.

363
01:26:16,394 --> 01:26:18,224
Save my daughter, Khan.

364
01:26:19,186 --> 01:26:21,987
I will, friend. I swear on God!

365
01:26:36,183 --> 01:26:39,375
- Remember the slap?
- Damn you!

366
01:26:40,378 --> 01:26:46,643
Your wife was right. She's better
off as a widow, than as your wife!

367
01:26:47,012 --> 01:26:51,671
I won't spare you! I'll
kill you, you rascal!

368
01:26:53,278 --> 01:26:56,469
Take a step forward, and
I'll kill this girl.

369
01:26:59,205 --> 01:27:03,163
I've changed my plan.

370
01:27:03,937 --> 01:27:09,634
Now I'll not kill him.

371
01:27:10,239 --> 01:27:13,827
But I'll make him lead
a life worse than death!

372
01:27:14,335 --> 01:27:19,221
Now he'll understand
Pasha's language!

373
01:27:21,730 --> 01:27:26,524
Do you plead guilty, or not,
to the crime you're charged with?

374
01:27:38,490 --> 01:27:41,854
"Save my Hena, Khan.
Save my daughter."

375
01:27:45,951 --> 01:27:47,509
Guilty!

376
01:27:50,951 --> 01:27:55,178
I killed jailer Rajput Khan.
Yes! I killed him.

377
01:27:59,181 --> 01:28:05,342
After taking into consideration
all the proof and statements made...

378
01:28:05,481 --> 01:28:08,233
...this Court sentences you
for life imprisonment.

379
01:28:40,647 --> 01:28:43,036
My darling girl...

380
01:28:58,434 --> 01:28:59,821
Sister-in-law...

381
01:29:04,382 --> 01:29:08,006
- All's well, isn't it?
- No! All is not well.

382
01:29:08,380 --> 01:29:13,833
My husband's in danger. His path
is filled with darkness.

383
01:29:14,340 --> 01:29:19,433
His symbol of love is staggering.
Go to your friend at once.

384
01:29:19,434 --> 01:29:25,231
- Go immediately, I say!
- Dreams turn out to be opposite.

385
01:29:26,100 --> 01:29:31,154
If you don't wish to go,
I'll go to India. I'll go!

386
01:29:32,358 --> 01:29:35,550
If you feel so strongly about it,
I'll leave in the morning.

387
01:29:35,588 --> 01:29:39,045
Tomorrow never comes.
Leave now, this moment.

388
01:30:01,733 --> 01:30:06,620
So, you dry-fruit of a Pathan.
Saw how strong I am?

389
01:30:07,430 --> 01:30:10,590
A mouse dares to toy with
a lion's whiskers...

390
01:30:10,662 --> 01:30:18,114
...when a lion is shackled!
Open these chains just once and see.

391
01:30:18,223 --> 01:30:23,482
My one roar will make you wet
your pants. Else I'll eat my hat!

392
01:30:24,783 --> 01:30:27,841
I'll undo your chains, eh?
Am I an ass?

393
01:30:28,382 --> 01:30:32,969
Am I a fool to free your
hands and invite death?

394
01:30:33,176 --> 01:30:38,096
I had told Pasha that I should
kill you, along with the jailer.

395
01:30:38,871 --> 01:30:44,290
But he spared you.
You're doomed as it is.

396
01:30:45,233 --> 01:30:48,063
But I'm not satisfied yet.

397
01:30:49,097 --> 01:30:53,117
You had slapped me, eh?
How had you hit me?

398
01:30:58,922 --> 01:31:02,511
You cur! You killed the jailer and
this poor man's being punished?

399
01:31:06,780 --> 01:31:12,041
Concerned about your lover, eh?
This is what is known as...

400
01:31:14,011 --> 01:31:19,272
The passion is mutual, eh?

401
01:31:20,105 --> 01:31:23,095
You've come to meet your lover?
Then go and meet him!

402
01:31:23,371 --> 01:31:26,662
Go and lick his lips... Wrap
yourself around his body!

403
01:31:30,831 --> 01:31:34,524
You've come to buss him,
and throw tantrums at me?

404
01:32:12,993 --> 01:32:15,585
What have you done?

405
01:32:18,458 --> 01:32:22,679
What a sister should
do for her brother.

406
01:32:24,247 --> 01:32:26,372
But, this is murder!

407
01:32:32,536 --> 01:32:35,901
- Give me that glass. - No!
- Why don't you understand?

408
01:32:36,533 --> 01:32:40,826
If you're hanged, who'll take care
of your boy? Who'll rear him?

409
01:32:41,261 --> 01:32:44,949
- Give me that.
- No! For the sake of my son...

410
01:32:45,256 --> 01:32:49,451
...I can't ruin your life any
more than it already is!

411
01:32:54,216 --> 01:32:56,498
We don't have the time.
The police are coming.

412
01:32:56,741 --> 01:33:00,967
Give the bottle! Look...

413
01:33:02,337 --> 01:33:06,527
Listen to me. You didn't
kill him. Understand?

414
01:33:07,198 --> 01:33:11,752
- Keep your mouth shut forever!
- No! - Hurry up and go!

415
01:33:13,225 --> 01:33:15,744
For your son's sake! Get lost!

416
01:33:31,941 --> 01:33:35,588
My dear friend,
why did you do it?

417
01:33:36,095 --> 01:33:39,482
You got yourself shut
behind bars for life?

418
01:33:39,494 --> 01:33:41,447
Why?

419
01:33:48,651 --> 01:33:54,413
My bosom friend. We'll
discuss all that later.

420
01:33:55,381 --> 01:33:57,573
First, come and hug me.

421
01:33:59,276 --> 01:34:04,499
It'll cool all the pent up turmoil.
This cursed being will feel nice.

422
01:34:05,941 --> 01:34:07,304
Come on...

423
01:34:09,968 --> 01:34:13,163
Dear friend!

424
01:34:20,194 --> 01:34:28,681
When you came, it was as though
Kabul came over. My Mehndi came.

425
01:34:29,353 --> 01:34:34,082
My Benazir walked in.
How is my Benazir?

426
01:34:36,515 --> 01:34:43,606
She's awaiting you by the
road you came to India.

427
01:34:45,136 --> 01:34:49,793
She has lit lamps on your
path of return!

428
01:34:56,093 --> 01:34:58,544
Put those lamps out, friend.

429
01:34:59,820 --> 01:35:03,646
- I cannot walk that road again.
- You can!

430
01:35:04,810 --> 01:35:08,230
I'll break these bars, and
take you away from here.

431
01:35:09,439 --> 01:35:11,805
Even I can do that.

432
01:35:13,400 --> 01:35:18,488
My hands are tied. Not with
chains, but, with friendship!

433
01:35:18,527 --> 01:35:23,750
You and your friendship! Did you
think before doing your duty...

434
01:35:24,019 --> 01:35:27,778
...as to what will happen to
your Benazir, and Mehndi?

435
01:35:28,247 --> 01:35:32,368
- My child is now in your hands.
- And, Benazir?

436
01:36:01,837 --> 01:36:04,258
Give her this talisman.

437
01:36:05,664 --> 01:36:07,927
You won't have to lie to her.

438
01:36:10,428 --> 01:36:13,516
Seeing this, she'll know.
That her Badshah is...

439
01:36:15,254 --> 01:36:20,601
...dead! - No!
For God's sake don't say that.

440
01:36:24,441 --> 01:36:30,334
Take hold of your self.
You've to bring up Mehndi now.

441
01:36:30,335 --> 01:36:35,250
I can't bring her up. Nor can
I take care of Benazir.

442
01:36:35,796 --> 01:36:39,848
Look at me! I can't help myself.

443
01:36:40,091 --> 01:36:42,279
How will I be able
to take care of them?

444
01:36:45,148 --> 01:36:50,698
My dear friend. Take pity on me.

445
01:36:51,770 --> 01:36:56,031
Don't saddle me with such a huge
responsibility. I'm Khuda Bux.

446
01:36:56,668 --> 01:36:58,460
Not Badshah Khan!

447
01:37:04,922 --> 01:37:06,248
Okay.

448
01:37:08,615 --> 01:37:12,963
I free you from this responsibility.

449
01:37:14,143 --> 01:37:19,558
But on one condition. Say
that you're not my friend.

450
01:37:19,970 --> 01:37:23,924
Don't say that Badshah Khan.

451
01:37:30,257 --> 01:37:35,582
Do me one more favor.

452
01:37:38,212 --> 01:37:43,064
This will remain a secret
between just the two of us.

453
01:37:46,668 --> 01:37:53,853
Badshah Khan is dead,
for those 2, back home...

454
01:37:54,423 --> 01:37:56,721
And for you too!

455
01:39:13,225 --> 01:39:14,849
Has Badshah come?

456
01:39:22,648 --> 01:39:31,229
He will never come back now!

457
01:39:42,217 --> 01:39:46,738
You're lying! Lying!

458
01:39:47,443 --> 01:39:50,898
- No! You're lying!
- My dear...

459
01:39:51,339 --> 01:39:53,101
Your son is lying!

460
01:39:55,797 --> 01:39:59,492
Look! My Badshah's come!

461
01:40:00,261 --> 01:40:05,313
Look! He's home. My
Badshah Khan's coming.

462
01:40:28,989 --> 01:40:31,281
My Khan hasn't come?

463
01:40:36,881 --> 01:40:43,066
He'll come! He'll definitely come!

464
01:42:14,402 --> 01:42:18,847
Dad has lost! He's defeated.

465
01:42:19,623 --> 01:42:23,308
Lost, my foot! How
did I lose? Tell me.

466
01:42:23,879 --> 01:42:26,963
- I won!
- How did you win?

467
01:42:27,303 --> 01:42:35,670
- Didn't I win?
- You threw dust in my eyes!

468
01:42:38,573 --> 01:42:44,016
- Didn't I win? - You won.
And you're happy. That's fine.

469
01:42:46,952 --> 01:42:50,637
Your happiness is the only aim
in my life, my dear.

470
01:42:51,506 --> 01:42:57,056
At times I feel that you've
sacrificed all your dreams...

471
01:42:57,057 --> 01:43:01,843
...comforts, joys, for my happiness.
Didn't you keep anything for you?

472
01:43:02,144 --> 01:43:06,294
Absolutely wrong.
I kept you for myself.

473
01:43:08,428 --> 01:43:12,114
- Ah, Mother! Come.
- Who won, son?

474
01:43:13,149 --> 01:43:15,338
The one who always wins.

475
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:22,356
Make preparations! I'm going
to India for the car-rally.

476
01:43:23,754 --> 01:43:26,375
What did you say? You'll go where?

477
01:43:27,477 --> 01:43:33,159
- India. - No, my dear.
You won't go to India.

478
01:43:33,760 --> 01:43:37,843
Why not? Why won't I go to India?

479
01:43:38,083 --> 01:43:41,960
Well... You explain
it to her, Mother.

480
01:43:42,903 --> 01:43:48,652
India is very far. And a young
girl all on her own there...

481
01:43:48,954 --> 01:43:53,774
Gran! This is the only country which
considers even foes as friends.

482
01:43:54,007 --> 01:43:57,953
- And I'm not even a foe!
So why fear? - But...

483
01:44:00,889 --> 01:44:06,173
Don't think too much.
If the thoughts are deep...

484
01:44:06,341 --> 01:44:10,492
"Friend, don't think so much.
If one thinks deeply...

485
01:44:10,531 --> 01:44:14,081
...it weakens the decisions.
- What is this "Car-Rally"?

486
01:44:14,752 --> 01:44:18,631
It's like our local horse-race.
Many cars race together...

487
01:44:21,202 --> 01:44:26,247
Every man wants to come first.
Every country will be represented.

488
01:44:26,721 --> 01:44:30,667
But the one to win will be...
Yours truly!

489
01:44:30,977 --> 01:44:33,528
But will you be able to
take on so many people?

490
01:44:39,421 --> 01:44:46,201
It'll be a trying, difficult test.
But my confidence is strong!

491
01:44:47,367 --> 01:44:52,379
If God wills let there be light,
then lamps remain lit in storms.

492
01:44:53,084 --> 01:44:56,532
O, great land of India
My salutations to thee.

493
01:45:09,940 --> 01:45:13,490
My child. Hena, my girl.

494
01:45:29,388 --> 01:45:31,680
How do I look in my uniform?

495
01:45:39,462 --> 01:45:41,787
Just like your father.

496
01:45:44,184 --> 01:45:47,473
If my friend, Rajput Khan,
was alive to see this...

497
01:45:48,072 --> 01:45:51,259
...he'd have gone mad with joy.

498
01:45:57,814 --> 01:46:03,188
- Congratulations.
- They are rightfully yours, Khan.

499
01:46:03,266 --> 01:46:07,519
No. Nothing depends on man's
words and thoughts.

500
01:46:08,385 --> 01:46:13,364
He uses the pen. The ideas are
his. We are but blank papers.

501
01:46:14,238 --> 01:46:17,719
Khan Uncle, the fact remains...

502
01:46:18,259 --> 01:46:22,603
...that whatever I am today,
is all due to your kindness.

503
01:46:23,679 --> 01:46:29,223
You've given me so much love,
that I never missed my father.

504
01:46:30,494 --> 01:46:33,408
That's why you rightfully
deserve congratulations.

505
01:46:33,686 --> 01:46:38,006
- No, my dear. What nonsense.
- There you go again.

506
01:46:38,141 --> 01:46:41,158
Once I say it's
your right, that's it!

507
01:46:43,992 --> 01:46:48,312
Please go away. I wish to
tell Uncle something important.

508
01:46:48,381 --> 01:46:51,795
- What do you want to say?
- Come along first.

509
01:46:52,137 --> 01:46:56,322
- Now be my confidant instead
of 'uncle'. - Anything special?

510
01:46:56,326 --> 01:47:02,732
- Very! Listen carefully. - Yes?
- There was this boy in my class.

511
01:47:04,305 --> 01:47:08,285
A boy? A boy has come in your life?

512
01:47:09,125 --> 01:47:11,881
He hasn't come or anything.

513
01:47:11,985 --> 01:47:14,775
But there's a danger,
that he just might!

514
01:47:16,240 --> 01:47:22,453
- Listen. Will you meet that
boastful inspector of mine? - Sure.

515
01:47:56,135 --> 01:48:00,320
This is Kalia speaking... Really?

516
01:48:08,004 --> 01:48:12,414
I'm Kamaljit speaking.
How are you?

517
01:48:13,023 --> 01:48:16,743
Congratulations! Really?

518
01:48:25,957 --> 01:48:28,611
It's me. Yes, go on Kantia...

519
01:48:30,011 --> 01:48:34,695
Well done my boy! You're
dodging the enemy?

520
01:48:36,030 --> 01:48:40,112
We've given you so much gold!
Do you know its rate in India?

521
01:51:25,549 --> 01:51:31,297
- What's happened? - Gone!
- The whole lot's gone!

522
01:51:36,054 --> 01:51:40,374
- Oh God! What's the matter?
Have you won the lottery? - Yes.

523
01:51:40,542 --> 01:51:43,424
And here is the key to it!

524
01:51:45,363 --> 01:51:49,479
- Key to it?
- Your honest son...

525
01:51:49,586 --> 01:51:53,101
...today caught a smuggler
red-handed. - So?

526
01:51:54,273 --> 01:51:58,650
I was going to handcuff him,
when he greased my palms.

527
01:51:59,160 --> 01:52:03,809
And then he handed over this key
to a luxurious bungalow.

528
01:52:04,114 --> 01:52:09,598
Get out of here, this moment.
You take bribes, you dishonest...

529
01:52:09,599 --> 01:52:12,479
Enough, Mummy; Enough.

530
01:52:13,455 --> 01:52:18,467
I hadn't heard your sermon on
"honesty", for a long time, you see.

531
01:52:20,603 --> 01:52:26,453
A son, with a mother like you, and
and honest and righteous father...

532
01:52:26,454 --> 01:52:29,641
...can never dream of
committing a crime.

533
01:52:31,541 --> 01:52:35,918
And this is the proof
of that truth.

534
01:52:37,094 --> 01:52:39,816
A medal for integrity
from the Government.

535
01:52:49,248 --> 01:52:50,944
Sir. Pasha on the line.

536
01:52:55,650 --> 01:52:59,540
- Save me, Dad. These guys will
kill me. - Control yourself.

537
01:53:00,120 --> 01:53:04,285
If they touch you, I'll kill them!
Now give the phone to them.

538
01:53:04,657 --> 01:53:08,114
- Says "Give the phone to the
bastards"! - Yes, go on.

539
01:53:08,725 --> 01:53:15,458
- You know the outcome of this.
- Don't threaten us, okay?

540
01:53:15,927 --> 01:53:19,783
If you're a tiger, we're no cubs.
If someone upsets the business...

541
01:53:19,863 --> 01:53:24,558
...we have to roughen him up!
Send us our stuff and take your son.

542
01:53:25,030 --> 01:53:29,661
Listen, Kalia. You'll get
your stuff. Why not?

543
01:53:30,232 --> 01:53:34,362
You'll get your stuff, and...
a counter-reply too!

544
01:53:35,837 --> 01:53:38,566
Rest, all fine.

545
01:53:40,871 --> 01:53:46,139
Raja. Your Raja.
Whom, the Government...

546
01:53:46,140 --> 01:53:49,370
...has awarded with a medal
for gallantry and integrity.

547
01:53:50,008 --> 01:53:54,240
My God! He's a young man now.

548
01:53:55,543 --> 01:53:59,900
The years have just flown
for you all, but...

549
01:54:01,179 --> 01:54:06,555
...for me, the time has stood
still. It never moved forward.

550
01:54:08,615 --> 01:54:11,608
All your life, you've been
giving joy to others.

551
01:54:12,385 --> 01:54:16,650
- Keep some for yourself...
- Enough! No more...

552
01:54:21,038 --> 01:54:27,153
Those I'm trying to forget,
by forgetting my own existence.

553
01:54:27,858 --> 01:54:30,747
Don't remind me of them.

554
01:54:33,159 --> 01:54:35,081
Don't remind me of them.

555
01:54:46,499 --> 01:54:48,921
He has come!

556
01:54:49,565 --> 01:54:54,297
He's here. He has come.

557
01:55:16,077 --> 01:55:19,205
What happened to Mummy?

558
01:55:25,181 --> 01:55:29,515
We tried all the expert doctors
and hakims. But of no avail.

559
01:55:30,250 --> 01:55:33,242
I just don't know what to do
for this unfortunate girl.

560
01:55:37,019 --> 01:55:41,113
Psychological scars aren't
healed by medicines, Mother.

561
01:55:41,953 --> 01:55:45,720
See the doctor out, my dear.

562
01:55:50,625 --> 01:55:54,015
- May God keep you. - Same to you.
- Give me that, doctor.

563
01:56:00,163 --> 01:56:02,425
Whenever I see you
in this condition...

564
01:56:03,963 --> 01:56:08,032
...I feel like a criminal, when
in fact, I'm the wronged one!

565
01:56:08,933 --> 01:56:12,900
May God damn that day, when
I brought you that awful news...

566
01:56:13,001 --> 01:56:14,662
Which unfortunate news?

567
01:56:17,270 --> 01:56:21,660
- Which news?
- News? What news?

568
01:56:23,839 --> 01:56:28,764
My dear father... Take
care of your memory.

569
01:56:29,175 --> 01:56:33,668
- Weren't you feeling ashamed now?
- That's the awful news, dear.

570
01:56:33,676 --> 01:56:36,771
- Which sent your mother
in a dead faint. - Yes, true.

571
01:56:38,645 --> 01:56:41,739
- I don't understand one thing.
- What?

572
01:56:43,381 --> 01:56:46,914
Somebody gave her the wrong news.
That while returning from India...

573
01:56:46,915 --> 01:56:50,942
...my father gave his own life,
in saving an innocent kid.

574
01:56:51,183 --> 01:56:54,415
And that shock made her
like this. But father...

575
01:56:54,685 --> 01:56:58,678
When you had come back alive,
why didn't she get over the shock?

576
01:56:59,387 --> 01:57:04,812
- Why didn't she recognize you?
- Well, dear... - He will come.

577
01:57:04,888 --> 01:57:06,982
He will return.

578
01:57:19,929 --> 01:57:25,264
Mother, come back. He's
here, who was to come.

579
01:57:25,865 --> 01:57:28,753
Look! He's right in front of you.

580
01:57:29,599 --> 01:57:31,488
Please recognize him.

581
01:57:37,169 --> 01:57:40,832
He will come. He will!

582
01:57:44,672 --> 01:57:49,739
Son, before Mehndi takes this secret,
as some kind of a conspiracy...

583
01:57:49,740 --> 01:57:54,040
...tell her everything.
- Softly. The walls have ears.

584
01:57:54,076 --> 01:57:58,034
Then stop her from going to India.
She's a carbon-copy of her mother.

585
01:57:58,077 --> 01:58:02,503
- If Badshah Khan sees her...
- For God's sake, keep quiet!

586
01:58:03,447 --> 01:58:06,779
Don't ever mention again that
I'm not Mehndi's father!

587
01:58:27,056 --> 01:58:31,787
Aren't you my father?

588
01:58:39,929 --> 01:58:43,227
How can you say that?
Of course he's your father.

589
01:58:44,598 --> 01:58:48,988
Such a blatant lie! Such
an immense betrayal!

590
01:58:49,732 --> 01:58:54,998
Don't try to hide the truth, Gran.
I've heard everything.

591
01:58:55,735 --> 01:59:01,831
Then hear this too. This lie...
This lie is holier than the truth.

592
01:59:02,104 --> 01:59:03,732
Who's my father?

593
01:59:07,507 --> 01:59:12,533
- Who's my father, and where is he?
- I can't tell you, dear child.

594
01:59:13,009 --> 01:59:18,537
- Why? Why can't you tell me?
- I've vowed not to tell.

595
01:59:18,744 --> 01:59:24,011
- So I can't tell you.
- You're lying again. Fooling me.

596
01:59:24,014 --> 01:59:27,141
You haven't vowed.
You're silent with disgrace.

597
01:59:27,214 --> 01:59:32,412
- You're ashamed to speak out!
- No! Don't say that, please.

598
01:59:32,584 --> 01:59:37,112
You've played fraud. You've
done something treacherous!

599
01:59:37,752 --> 01:59:41,119
- For God's sake, hold your tongue!
- To avail my mother...

600
01:59:41,154 --> 01:59:43,488
...you got rid of my father!

601
01:59:50,124 --> 01:59:54,891
So, now we know what is right
and what is wrong.

602
01:59:55,660 --> 01:59:59,255
The truth is out.

603
01:59:59,327 --> 02:00:02,354
What I said was true after all.

604
02:00:04,697 --> 02:00:08,962
You're a criminal! I hate you!

605
02:00:09,698 --> 02:00:12,997
I hate you! Hate you!

606
02:00:22,137 --> 02:00:26,699
For God's sake, Mummy.
Say something, today at least.

607
02:00:27,473 --> 02:00:31,967
Tell me, who's my father?
Where is he? Tell me!

608
02:00:32,543 --> 02:00:36,240
He'll come. He'll definitely come.

609
02:00:37,243 --> 02:00:41,737
Who'll come?
From where will he come?

610
02:00:47,715 --> 02:00:52,570
What are you doing, son?
What crime have you done?

611
02:00:52,883 --> 02:00:55,876
Why are you punishing
yourself like this?

612
02:00:56,685 --> 02:00:59,917
I lifted my hand at a girl
who means more than life to me.

613
02:01:00,220 --> 02:01:04,145
No! No, my son, No!

614
02:01:07,490 --> 02:01:10,380
A strong man,
understands things, mother.

615
02:01:11,157 --> 02:01:16,050
My sweet girl hates me!
I won't be able to bear it.

616
02:01:16,128 --> 02:01:19,926
Then go, my son. Tell
her the whole story.

617
02:01:20,428 --> 02:01:25,194
- Remove that stigma from your head.
- What will I tell Badshah Khan?

618
02:01:25,830 --> 02:01:28,925
What will he think, except that...

619
02:01:29,066 --> 02:01:34,900
- I broke the promise I gave him.
- You didn't break it, son.

620
02:01:35,301 --> 02:01:39,533
That Almighty Lord broke it.
Please listen to me.

621
02:01:39,736 --> 02:01:45,435
Go and tell her.
For God's sake, go.

622
02:01:56,777 --> 02:02:02,544
- My dear child! - What new
plans do you have now to fool me?

623
02:02:03,380 --> 02:02:07,769
Isn't it enough to say, I didn't
love you so much for 18 years...

624
02:02:08,348 --> 02:02:10,806
...as I hate you in
the last 18 minutes?

625
02:02:11,650 --> 02:02:15,539
I don't want to see your damn
face! Go away from here!

626
02:02:16,152 --> 02:02:17,813
My dear child...

627
02:02:20,453 --> 02:02:25,311
If you learn the truth...
Your hate will turn into love.

628
02:02:25,855 --> 02:02:32,315
Not love, but into enmity!
You don't deserve forgiveness.

629
02:02:32,692 --> 02:02:36,218
You'll go to hell!
Do you hear? To hell!

630
02:02:36,427 --> 02:02:41,659
Don't utter such words, which will
make you ashamed to take back!

631
02:02:41,862 --> 02:02:46,491
- Don't let his sacrifice go in vain.
- I won't hear another word!

632
02:02:46,565 --> 02:02:50,522
You'll have to!
Every single word of it!

633
02:02:52,033 --> 02:02:54,626
And you'll have to believe
each and every word.

634
02:02:59,903 --> 02:03:03,862
This is the Holy Book, Koran.
With his hand on this...

635
02:03:04,037 --> 02:03:06,199
...even the devil cannot lie.

636
02:03:24,513 --> 02:03:26,743
I've not cheated you, my dear.

637
02:03:27,781 --> 02:03:32,774
God knows, I love you
more than life itself.

638
02:03:33,816 --> 02:03:38,618
This lie I told, was just
a white lie, my dear.

639
02:03:40,152 --> 02:03:44,180
- Then what's the truth?
- The truth is...

640
02:03:45,121 --> 02:03:47,044
...that your father is alive.

641
02:04:06,464 --> 02:04:10,697
Did you hear? Father
is alive. In India.

642
02:04:11,466 --> 02:04:14,594
I'll go and get him, Mummy.
I sure will.

643
02:04:23,651 --> 02:04:25,339
Come back.

644
02:04:29,157 --> 02:04:32,740
- Who's speaking? - O, really?
How many fathers do you have?

645
02:04:32,741 --> 02:04:38,274
- Yes, father?
- There's a car-rally in India.

646
02:04:38,546 --> 02:04:43,579
- And a car from Kabul is taking
part in it. - A car from Kabul.

647
02:04:43,653 --> 02:04:48,687
- It's a white car.
- A white car.

648
02:04:48,728 --> 02:04:53,730
And its number is...
Kabul... 175.

649
02:04:53,838 --> 02:04:58,815
- Kabul 178?
- 175, you fool!

650
02:04:59,112 --> 02:05:04,012
- Kabul, 175. - Yes.
And our stuff is coming by plane.

651
02:05:04,155 --> 02:05:07,097
But you just said,
it's coming by car.

652
02:05:07,372 --> 02:05:12,181
No! The car's coming by plane.
The stuff is in the car.

653
02:05:12,548 --> 02:05:15,297
- I'm beginning to doubt
your mother! Rest all fine!

654
02:05:16,329 --> 02:05:17,846
Our stuff is on the way!

655
02:05:29,797 --> 02:05:33,541
- Welcome.
- Our consignment's here. Come on.

656
02:05:39,664 --> 02:05:44,446
I'm happy to see Indian men.
I was not sure which road to take.

657
02:05:45,122 --> 02:05:47,839
You'll take the road
we tell you to!!

658
02:05:48,407 --> 02:05:52,623
You rascals!
You'll go, where I go!

659
02:06:23,785 --> 02:06:27,162
Hey, you scoundrel.
You turned out to be a sissy!

660
02:06:35,875 --> 02:06:42,016
- Why the road-block?
- Are you the moon, or the sun?

661
02:06:44,547 --> 02:06:48,886
Whatever you are... By God,
you're luscious!

662
02:06:50,626 --> 02:06:54,671
A cherry in a sparrow's beak...
God's creation.

663
02:06:55,209 --> 02:06:59,084
A monkey in a fairy's attire...
That's God's creation too!

664
02:06:59,229 --> 02:07:05,438
You're correct. All these days,
he thought he was a great poet.

665
02:07:08,529 --> 02:07:12,370
- Who are you?
- Me? I'm Inspector Hena.

666
02:07:12,483 --> 02:07:16,393
And he is... Inspector Monkey.
I mean, Inspector Raja!

667
02:07:23,843 --> 02:07:29,350
You're a policeman?
I was looking for you...

668
02:07:32,649 --> 02:07:36,896
- Even I was looking for you.
- Then take me to the jail.

669
02:07:37,231 --> 02:07:42,409
That means you admit to your crime.

670
02:07:43,609 --> 02:07:47,723
Sweetheart, I'll agree to whatever
you say. I accept you...

671
02:07:48,591 --> 02:07:51,040
I accept him too.
I accept everything!

672
02:08:07,560 --> 02:08:12,434
- What are you searching under there?
- Just stand still!

673
02:08:13,141 --> 02:08:17,821
Hey you! How dare you talk
to me like this? I'm a Pathan.

674
02:08:18,325 --> 02:08:21,767
- Nobody talks rudely to me.
- I'm a Rajput too.

675
02:08:22,242 --> 02:08:26,062
I'm not used to it either.
Show me your passport!

676
02:08:32,673 --> 02:08:38,150
Have it replaced. Lower the car.

677
02:08:39,085 --> 02:08:41,034
Hena, no need for that.

678
02:08:49,316 --> 02:08:52,694
I thought you were decent,
and trusted you.

679
02:08:53,137 --> 02:09:00,002
But you insulted a Pathani girl.
I'll never forget you! Never!

680
02:09:05,926 --> 02:09:09,869
Hena, we'll have to
keep an eye on her.

681
02:09:10,311 --> 02:09:14,425
An eye on her? But you
said she was innocent.

682
02:09:15,327 --> 02:09:19,610
If one has to win
in a game of chess...

683
02:09:19,711 --> 02:09:22,465
It's the queen which is played.
Not the pawn!

684
02:10:19,304 --> 02:10:21,289
I've found my father!

685
02:10:34,055 --> 02:10:36,933
- You search her room.
- And you go after her!

686
02:11:33,882 --> 02:11:37,372
Hey you! What did you think?

687
02:11:37,876 --> 02:11:41,419
That you'd break my bones,
and go to Ahmedabad?

688
02:11:41,624 --> 02:11:48,119
Hey you pistachio... note this.
We'll skin you, to get our stuff!

689
02:11:49,056 --> 02:11:52,835
O pomegranate... Do you know
whose consignment you were stealing?

690
02:11:53,469 --> 02:11:55,685
My name is Kaliya Danger.

691
02:12:03,021 --> 02:12:05,002
We got our stuff, guys!

692
02:12:09,391 --> 02:12:12,367
This proves that the
policeman was correct.

693
02:12:13,238 --> 02:12:17,278
You swine! You point a gun
at a Pathan's daughter?

694
02:12:17,650 --> 02:12:20,062
You aim a gun at me?
Okay then, shoot!

695
02:12:28,065 --> 02:12:30,916
Hey sweetheart...
You're fantastic!

696
02:14:05,686 --> 02:14:10,264
Hey you, policeman...
If you wish, you can...

697
02:14:10,365 --> 02:14:13,442
...arrest me, or even handcuff me.

698
02:14:14,809 --> 02:14:19,346
Indian men don't put handcuffs
on women. Instead they...

699
02:14:20,652 --> 02:14:24,256
Instead?
What do they put instead?

700
02:20:36,361 --> 02:20:39,576
Mehndi? In India?

701
02:20:40,111 --> 02:20:43,768
- Then why didn't you bring her?
- I was going to, uncle...

702
02:20:44,239 --> 02:20:47,657
...but how could I? I would've
had to break my vow.

703
02:20:47,899 --> 02:20:51,418
- Vow? - You yourself have
made us vow to keep silent.

704
02:20:51,526 --> 02:20:57,011
Yes! Yes!

705
02:21:01,114 --> 02:21:02,636
I had forgotten.

706
02:21:06,006 --> 02:21:10,126
I... I had forgotten.

707
02:21:10,866 --> 02:21:16,189
What kind of a father, are you?
Your child is a few paces away...

708
02:21:16,190 --> 02:21:20,016
...and you can't walk them?
You can't hug her to your heart?

709
02:21:20,183 --> 02:21:25,770
What do you think I am?
Aren't I human too?

710
02:21:26,542 --> 02:21:31,560
Don't I also have a heart?
My daughter, Mehndi...

711
02:21:31,634 --> 02:21:35,661
...is but a few steps away, and
I'm not dying to embrace her?

712
02:21:35,662 --> 02:21:40,080
Then accept her publicly, and hug
that unfortunate girl to your heart.

713
02:21:41,055 --> 02:21:44,947
For years now, you've been
drowning in an ocean of sorrows.

714
02:21:44,948 --> 02:21:48,365
What for? Be human, uncle.

715
02:21:49,208 --> 02:21:55,930
The world stones angels!
Crucifies and shoots them down!

716
02:21:56,597 --> 02:22:00,923
And don't you yourself say, that
there's no higher emotion than love?

717
02:22:00,924 --> 02:22:02,547
True, my dear.

718
02:22:04,985 --> 02:22:07,745
It's my very love for Mehndi
that is keeping me away from her.

719
02:22:09,478 --> 02:22:13,805
For if she comes to know that I am
alive; A criminal, a killer... - No!

720
02:22:13,806 --> 02:22:17,166
- You're not a criminal!
You're innocent. - Who'll buy that?

721
02:22:18,000 --> 02:22:20,451
Who'll hear the cry of truth,
in a jungle of lies?

722
02:22:21,893 --> 02:22:24,652
No! No!

723
02:22:26,421 --> 02:22:28,645
I'm not a selfish father.

724
02:22:30,081 --> 02:22:33,204
I'll die but I'll not have
my daughter humiliated.

725
02:22:35,239 --> 02:22:40,825
She's leading a proud life as
a daughter of Khuda Bux. Amen!

726
02:22:42,263 --> 02:22:44,817
At the moment, it's
only me who's ruined.

727
02:22:46,156 --> 02:22:51,081
If my secret's out, we'll
all be ruined, my dear.

728
02:22:53,565 --> 02:22:58,205
Darling child, will you do a
favor for this unfortunate man?

729
02:22:58,306 --> 02:23:02,256
- Want my life?
- No, no. Not your life.

730
02:23:02,633 --> 02:23:08,394
A favor. Mehndi is a stranger here.
And she's all alone...

731
02:23:08,999 --> 02:23:12,545
- Take care of her.
- She's not alone, uncle.

732
02:23:14,581 --> 02:23:20,031
- She's found a good friend.
- Here? So soon?

733
02:23:21,604 --> 02:23:24,592
A cupid's arrow is
not a slave to time.

734
02:23:25,500 --> 02:23:29,223
Mehndi and Raja
have fallen in love.

735
02:23:30,624 --> 02:23:34,212
Love? Who's this Raja?

736
02:23:35,317 --> 02:23:38,372
That colleague of mine.
The Inspector.

737
02:24:30,636 --> 02:24:34,587
- Khan! - Salma...
- Dear brother Khan...

738
02:24:34,896 --> 02:24:39,052
- You're released!
- Yes.

739
02:24:40,388 --> 02:24:45,677
The Government took my behavior
into account, and released me early.

740
02:24:45,979 --> 02:24:49,204
By God!
Seeing you out of that jail...

741
02:24:49,241 --> 02:24:53,964
I can't tell you how happy I am.
Please come in.

742
02:24:56,562 --> 02:25:00,082
The opening of the jail's doors,
has opened the doors to Kabul!

743
02:25:00,591 --> 02:25:02,353
When are you going home?

744
02:25:11,142 --> 02:25:13,867
A devastated house is not
referred to as a "home".

745
02:25:16,335 --> 02:25:19,661
Kabul is now that dream,
which I can feel in mind, but...

746
02:25:20,229 --> 02:25:23,609
...never see again.
- What nonsense!

747
02:25:23,989 --> 02:25:28,371
Knowing about Benazir, won't
you meet your daughter?

748
02:25:30,113 --> 02:25:34,870
Mehndi is no more in Kabul now.

749
02:25:35,905 --> 02:25:41,093
- She's here in this city.
- Then why didn't you bring her?

750
02:25:41,529 --> 02:25:44,687
Travelers who have
different destinations...

751
02:25:44,793 --> 02:25:49,549
...do not travel together.
- Meaning?

752
02:25:51,251 --> 02:25:57,834
I've been released from the jail
of the law, not of my fate.

753
02:25:59,902 --> 02:26:04,457
The heart may experience a void.
It may even bleed... but...

754
02:26:06,826 --> 02:26:10,653
- But this father can't meet
his daughter. - Why not?

755
02:26:16,745 --> 02:26:22,693
My daughter, Mehndi
loves your son, Raja.

756
02:26:23,700 --> 02:26:27,686
Lord above! I've heard this name
a thousand times on Raja's lips...

757
02:26:27,695 --> 02:26:31,613
...yet I couldn't tally it to you!
Khan, dear brother!

758
02:26:31,790 --> 02:26:35,981
I'm so lucky! Your daughter,
my daughter-in-law to be!

759
02:26:35,982 --> 02:26:41,041
I'll find heaven on this earth!
What else do I want?

760
02:26:41,042 --> 02:26:45,527
Raja too should find this heaven.
That's why I can't meet Mehndi.

761
02:26:45,703 --> 02:26:48,121
- I don't understand.
- Oh, dear sister!

762
02:26:49,861 --> 02:26:54,018
If Raja finds out that Mehndi's
father, is his father's killer...

763
02:26:54,056 --> 02:26:58,939
...then heaven will become hell!
He'll leave my daughter! - Why?

764
02:26:59,082 --> 02:27:02,709
He'll have to accept Mehndi.
I'll convince him.

765
02:27:02,710 --> 02:27:06,002
I'll tell him the facts. The truth.

766
02:27:08,801 --> 02:27:11,220
It's a very bitter truth.

767
02:27:13,194 --> 02:27:17,486
His father was an honest
and a righteous man.

768
02:27:18,520 --> 02:27:22,471
You brought your son up, telling
him this. Now what will you say?

769
02:27:23,012 --> 02:27:27,633
That it was all a lie!
That the real murderer is...

770
02:27:27,772 --> 02:27:31,723
...his own Mother? No! No!

771
02:27:35,061 --> 02:27:38,445
I was punished for this crime.
He'll believe that fact.

772
02:27:40,287 --> 02:27:45,078
Don't fan the ashes now.
It may turn into an inferno!

773
02:27:45,713 --> 02:27:49,593
I'm burnt as it is. It may not
burn their love along with me!

774
02:27:49,939 --> 02:27:53,232
A daughter will lose her love,
like her parents lost it.

775
02:28:00,423 --> 02:28:06,406
Silence! Silence is the
only balm for this wound.

776
02:28:08,746 --> 02:28:13,037
Just... You just keep my
daughter happy.

777
02:28:14,137 --> 02:28:16,260
That's what I had
come to beg from you.

778
02:28:17,664 --> 02:28:19,154
God bless, dear sister.

779
02:29:02,882 --> 02:29:06,714
Hey, Mister! Why are
you staring like that?

780
02:29:11,269 --> 02:29:14,583
- Who are you?
- Darling...

781
02:29:15,712 --> 02:29:22,564
He's a Pathan. His body gives
off the fragrance of Kabul.

782
02:29:22,906 --> 02:29:27,214
You're from Kabul, aren't you?
He's my countryman!

783
02:29:28,145 --> 02:29:31,581
- You must be knowing
Khuda Bux. - What?

784
02:29:32,586 --> 02:29:34,962
- No, I don't.
- No?

785
02:29:37,161 --> 02:29:39,910
Won't you bless this daughter?

786
02:29:48,730 --> 02:29:53,164
- Blessings?
- Yes! You're from my country.

787
02:29:53,605 --> 02:29:57,246
Seeing you, reminded me
of my father, Khuda Bux.

788
02:29:57,582 --> 02:30:03,217
Had he been here, he'd have hugged
me and blessed me at betrothal.

789
02:30:18,930 --> 02:30:20,946
A long life to you, my dear.

790
02:30:24,569 --> 02:30:26,389
May you have a long life.

791
02:30:43,067 --> 02:30:48,203
- Who was he, Mother?
- A traveler...

792
02:30:48,375 --> 02:30:51,980
...who stays away from his
destination, after having reached it.

793
02:30:52,484 --> 02:30:56,226
I asked who was this person?

794
02:30:58,685 --> 02:31:00,868
He was your father's friend.

795
02:31:10,520 --> 02:31:15,293
- Raja! You?
- Meet my fiancée, Mehndi.

796
02:31:18,114 --> 02:31:22,082
- The fact is, she wants to meet
her father. - His name is...

797
02:31:22,191 --> 02:31:24,770
...Badshah Khan!
- Badshah Khan!

798
02:31:27,231 --> 02:31:31,336
- Badshah Khan has been released.
- Released?

799
02:31:33,065 --> 02:31:35,610
My father's released?

800
02:31:36,283 --> 02:31:39,324
This is fantastic news!

801
02:31:43,940 --> 02:31:49,572
Ask your friend to show me
my father's photo, if he has one.

802
02:31:50,141 --> 02:31:52,723
I haven't seen my father
as yet, you see.

803
02:31:55,726 --> 02:31:59,915
Constable! Take her, and show her
the file of convict 401.

804
02:32:06,222 --> 02:32:10,292
Badshah Khan is the man who
had killed your father.

805
02:32:14,775 --> 02:32:21,078
A man who should've been poisoned,
was sent meals... from your house!

806
02:32:23,713 --> 02:32:27,626
The woman you're accusing,
is my mother. Mother!

807
02:33:13,656 --> 02:33:17,599
Why has this Hena suddenly lost
its color seeing the other one?

808
02:33:18,438 --> 02:33:21,855
Is it because I've robbed you
of your own color?

809
02:33:23,233 --> 02:33:26,510
What are you saying? I just...

810
02:33:28,673 --> 02:33:31,053
Hena has willingly given her
own color to Mehndi.

811
02:33:35,250 --> 02:33:39,500
Where is he? Where's that thief?

812
02:33:40,998 --> 02:33:46,402
- Thief?
- Today you're facing such a truth...

813
02:33:47,343 --> 02:33:49,961
...that even the mirror can't
lie looking at it!

814
02:33:50,963 --> 02:33:55,112
Where's that cruel father?
Who did good deeds for others...

815
02:33:55,648 --> 02:33:57,803
...but forgot his own people.

816
02:34:01,925 --> 02:34:07,175
A daughter is pining for a father.
Tell me where he is.

817
02:34:08,405 --> 02:34:10,830
- Where's that butcher of a father?
- Don't call him that.

818
02:34:10,831 --> 02:34:16,643
Don't torture him further.
He's like God.

819
02:34:19,004 --> 02:34:22,323
Then tell me, where
is that god of yours?

820
02:34:26,379 --> 02:34:30,922
Forgive me. But I'm a Rajput girl.

821
02:34:31,991 --> 02:34:33,942
I can't break my promise.

822
02:34:35,914 --> 02:34:39,065
Forgive me, please.

823
02:34:44,450 --> 02:34:47,434
It's your birthday today,
isn't it?

824
02:34:47,709 --> 02:34:50,823
Yes, and it's your birthday too.

825
02:34:51,792 --> 02:34:56,982
Do you do charity on your birthday?

826
02:35:05,614 --> 02:35:07,905
Then give me my father
in charity today.

827
02:35:10,197 --> 02:35:13,112
Give me my father.

828
02:42:54,194 --> 02:42:58,186
What's the matter, my dear?
For God's sake, what is it?

829
02:42:58,688 --> 02:43:02,174
All's well, isn't it?
Did you meet Badshah Khan?

830
02:43:02,315 --> 02:43:04,837
I wish I hadn't now!

831
02:43:06,975 --> 02:43:10,360
- Why are you saying that?
- That's what I want to know.

832
02:43:11,002 --> 02:43:14,228
I thought, after 18
years of separation...

833
02:43:14,462 --> 02:43:20,420
...seeing that I'm just like Mummy,
he'd yearn for me... and hug me...

834
02:43:20,421 --> 02:43:23,045
...like one crazy and be
unable to bear the joy.

835
02:43:23,385 --> 02:43:27,334
That he'd repeat my name
and shed tears himself...

836
02:43:27,475 --> 02:43:31,496
...and make me cry too. But...

837
02:43:32,271 --> 02:43:34,631
But nothing of the sort happened.

838
02:43:36,833 --> 02:43:39,688
He's refusing to acknowledge me,
even after recognizing me.

839
02:43:41,222 --> 02:43:44,177
I can't bear this shock now.

840
02:43:45,283 --> 02:43:48,404
I'll go mad! I may even die!

841
02:43:49,942 --> 02:43:53,961
I'll die, die!

842
02:43:54,170 --> 02:43:57,553
For God's sake! For the
sake of us all.

843
02:43:57,798 --> 02:44:02,850
Don't do something drastic. I'll
come to India with your mother.

844
02:44:03,189 --> 02:44:06,049
Did you hear? I'm coming
with your mother.

845
02:44:16,367 --> 02:44:20,215
Son! How come you're
home early today?

846
02:44:20,594 --> 02:44:22,515
Everything's fine, isn't it?

847
02:44:29,712 --> 02:44:32,234
This tiffin-box is yours, right?

848
02:44:36,337 --> 02:44:39,458
I asked if this tiffin-box
was yours.

849
02:44:44,125 --> 02:44:45,452
Yes.

850
02:44:50,148 --> 02:44:53,939
Where had you forgotten it...
Salma Begum?

851
02:44:55,306 --> 02:45:00,497
You dare to take your mother's
name? Has liquor got you too?

852
02:45:00,498 --> 02:45:05,788
You said my father was
killed while on duty.

853
02:45:08,651 --> 02:45:12,172
Did he die, or, was he murdered?

854
02:45:15,616 --> 02:45:18,368
Why did you call that Pathan
a friend of my father?

855
02:45:20,130 --> 02:45:23,006
Why did you take food
for that killer in the jail?

856
02:45:24,842 --> 02:45:31,049
Oh God! Go away! Go away from here.

857
02:45:32,678 --> 02:45:38,183
- Don't make me curse my son!
- I'm a curse to you anyway.

858
02:45:39,251 --> 02:45:42,007
An innocent prey to your infidelity.

859
02:45:42,706 --> 02:45:47,713
What is that Pathan to you?
I'll get an answer to this question.

860
02:45:48,550 --> 02:45:53,225
Not from you, but from that
bastard of a Pathan!

861
02:46:00,670 --> 02:46:02,685
You're leaving us?

862
02:46:06,047 --> 02:46:08,834
A spot of blood has come
so close to me...

863
02:46:09,369 --> 02:46:14,272
...that I won't be able to stop
myself from acknowledging it.

864
02:46:18,464 --> 02:46:21,681
Where will you go?

865
02:46:24,672 --> 02:46:28,548
To a place where I'll be
able to pray for all.

866
02:46:31,744 --> 02:46:33,998
And does this deserve only curses?

867
02:46:39,647 --> 02:46:43,124
- You?
- What prayers do you have for it?

868
02:46:43,630 --> 02:46:47,041
What prayers do you have for her
who greyed overnight in your memory?

869
02:46:47,749 --> 02:46:52,855
What blessings for her who burnt
lamps in your memory at daytime?

870
02:46:52,860 --> 02:46:57,970
And burnt herself away too!
What prayers do you have for her...

871
02:46:58,373 --> 02:47:01,783
...who became mad on
hearing of your death?

872
02:47:04,349 --> 02:47:07,950
Mad? My...

873
02:47:08,687 --> 02:47:14,045
- My Benazir, mad?
- Yes! She has gone crazy.

874
02:47:14,145 --> 02:47:18,584
- No! - For the last 18 years,
she's repeating just one line.

875
02:47:18,726 --> 02:47:22,600
- "He'll come." "He'll come."
- Oh God!

876
02:47:24,436 --> 02:47:27,516
I've committed a terrible crime.
Oh Lord!

877
02:47:27,789 --> 02:47:35,825
This is a great crime
I've done. A great sin.

878
02:47:35,826 --> 02:47:40,263
Why are you not acknowledging me?
Cos, I may be ashamed of your deeds?

879
02:47:44,638 --> 02:47:48,167
Father!
The way you have sacrificed...

880
02:47:48,573 --> 02:47:51,294
...even the angels can't do that.

881
02:47:53,289 --> 02:47:57,831
I'm not ashamed of you.
But I feel proud! Proud.

882
02:47:59,828 --> 02:48:04,769
- My dear child!
- Father. - Dear daughter.

883
02:48:06,203 --> 02:48:09,252
- My darling daughter...
- Father.

884
02:48:10,022 --> 02:48:13,602
Father, your blood
flows in my veins...

885
02:48:13,874 --> 02:48:17,554
...and yet you didn't
recognize me? - Dear child.

886
02:48:19,186 --> 02:48:23,627
For a father like you, I can
forego a thousand Rajas!

887
02:48:25,397 --> 02:48:28,146
- Forego a thousand Rajas.
- Enough.

888
02:48:29,347 --> 02:48:35,479
Enough now, my dear. Come on...

889
02:48:36,286 --> 02:48:39,434
Take me to Kabul. To my Benazir.

890
02:48:40,237 --> 02:48:44,608
Kabul is coming here. Mummy
is coming with your friend.

891
02:48:45,946 --> 02:48:49,294
Here? My Benazir is coming here?

892
02:48:49,469 --> 02:48:54,869
- My friend too? - Yes.
- Take hold of me, my dear.

893
02:48:55,343 --> 02:49:00,088
Take control of me. I've
gone mad hearing they're coming.

894
02:49:00,158 --> 02:49:03,568
If I see them, my heart
may not stop beating.

895
02:49:03,644 --> 02:49:06,157
Come, my dear. Let's go.

896
02:49:10,751 --> 02:49:14,556
There are other ways to
stop one's heart-beats.

897
02:49:14,766 --> 02:49:17,147
The distance you couldn't cover
in the last 18 years...

898
02:49:19,924 --> 02:49:21,963
...is out of reach even now.

899
02:49:23,300 --> 02:49:27,771
- What are you talking about?
- What nonsense is this? - Get lost.

900
02:49:27,880 --> 02:49:30,239
- Have you been drinking?
- Shut up!

901
02:49:33,956 --> 02:49:38,328
- What is this?
- Blood. - Whose blood?

902
02:49:40,332 --> 02:49:45,008
- If you're wounded then. It's yours
- Holy, or unholy?

903
02:49:45,479 --> 02:49:48,594
I don't know that you mean.

904
02:49:50,491 --> 02:49:54,533
Surprising!
You should know blood.

905
02:49:55,839 --> 02:49:57,852
You've spilt it in gallons!

906
02:49:59,587 --> 02:50:04,403
First Habibullah. Then your friend,
Jailer Rajput Khan.

907
02:50:04,667 --> 02:50:09,316
- Then... my father!
- You're mistaken!

908
02:50:09,317 --> 02:50:11,934
Tell me! Why did you kill him?

909
02:50:12,072 --> 02:50:18,311
- What is my mother to you?
- For God's sake, don't commit a sin.

910
02:50:22,997 --> 02:50:27,434
The vile blood of a vile father,
showed its colors at last!

911
02:50:28,376 --> 02:50:32,587
You have proved, that
bad blood of a father...

912
02:50:32,591 --> 02:50:35,502
...can't be washed away,
by a mother's white milk!

913
02:50:36,076 --> 02:50:40,719
- You want to hear your father
being praised? - No, Salma.

914
02:50:40,847 --> 02:50:45,079
Well, listen! Your father
was neither decent...

915
02:50:45,346 --> 02:50:50,503
...nor was he honest. He was
a drunkard and debaucher.

916
02:50:53,847 --> 02:50:59,036
He was a slave to that rascal,
Pasha! He was even ready...

917
02:50:59,073 --> 02:51:02,145
...to sell your mother,
for some money.

918
02:51:02,383 --> 02:51:04,956
- It's a lie!
- It's the truth!

919
02:51:09,762 --> 02:51:13,461
Your father wasn't murdered
by this good Samaritan.

920
02:51:14,127 --> 02:51:18,188
I killed him! Your own mother!

921
02:51:19,122 --> 02:51:22,655
What are you looking at?
Take your pistol. Go on.

922
02:51:22,862 --> 02:51:26,989
And shoot your mother in the
heart. Give me my punishment.

923
02:51:29,310 --> 02:51:33,112
He is not my lover...

924
02:51:33,546 --> 02:51:38,923
...but a brother! Closer than
even real brothers.

925
02:51:41,090 --> 02:51:45,320
I killed a man, and this poor man
had to serve the sentence.

926
02:51:45,654 --> 02:51:47,232
For your sake!

927
02:51:50,051 --> 02:51:53,591
He declared himself dead
to his own family...

928
02:51:53,592 --> 02:51:59,400
...so that I could live...
Live to rear you!

929
02:52:01,533 --> 02:52:06,843
Laxmi was widowed by your father.
Hena was orphaned by him!

930
02:52:07,056 --> 02:52:12,372
He shot Jailer Rajput, and
charged this man for the murder.

931
02:52:13,076 --> 02:52:17,839
Fool! Even if you wash his feet, and
drink that water all your life...

932
02:52:17,840 --> 02:52:20,647
...you won't be able to repay
his obligations to you!

933
02:52:31,901 --> 02:52:37,324
Greetings. Pasha here.

934
02:52:39,023 --> 02:52:43,790
Few gusts have blown in from
Kabul, my dear friend...

935
02:52:44,057 --> 02:52:48,194
Gusts of wind! And with them
they've brought a walnut...

936
02:52:48,696 --> 02:52:53,588
...and a she-walnut! The nut's
name is Khuda Bux...

937
02:52:53,961 --> 02:52:57,826
...your future father-in-law.
And the she-nut's name is...

938
02:52:58,532 --> 02:53:03,337
Benazir. Your mother-in-law
to be. Listen, dear friend...

939
02:53:03,702 --> 02:53:06,143
...we have a deal to make yet.

940
02:53:06,616 --> 02:53:10,787
Give me money, and take
this pair of nuts.

941
02:53:11,286 --> 02:53:14,725
This poor man's abode is aptly
named " Burial Ground".

942
02:53:15,727 --> 02:53:20,550
Very nice name, don't you think?
And listen. Don't try to be smart.

943
02:53:20,961 --> 02:53:27,312
Else you'll just find shells
of these nuts! Just the shells.

944
02:53:27,818 --> 02:53:32,146
Get me? Rest all fine, young man.

945
02:54:08,036 --> 02:54:09,956
- Who is Pasha?
- What?

946
02:54:09,957 --> 02:54:11,741
Who is Pasha?

947
02:54:12,044 --> 02:54:20,584
My dear friend...
The name is short...

948
02:54:20,856 --> 02:54:25,489
...Pasha! But I do
some terrible deeds.

949
02:54:26,787 --> 02:54:28,729
So! Have you got the money?

950
02:54:36,814 --> 02:54:41,354
First, hand over those two to me.

951
02:55:02,158 --> 02:55:05,530
Mr. Burial Ground...
I never miss my target.

952
02:55:05,939 --> 02:55:08,725
Tell your men to drop their guns.

953
02:55:11,477 --> 02:55:16,347
O my lovely... If you say so,
why just the guns...?

954
02:55:16,517 --> 02:55:20,930
I'll strip myself of everything!
Put those guns down!

955
02:55:21,603 --> 02:55:23,514
Didn't you hear?

956
02:56:10,050 --> 02:56:13,658
I haven't come to return
your venom.

957
02:56:14,428 --> 02:56:19,792
I've come to repay a favor.
My father's bad blood...

958
02:56:20,567 --> 02:56:25,602
...can be washed away by mother's
milk. An Indian can also...

959
02:56:25,741 --> 02:56:30,384
...repay a favor with a favor.

960
02:56:30,553 --> 02:56:36,191
What favor? I haven't done a
favor for anybody till today.

961
02:56:36,761 --> 02:56:41,505
Look! Recognize her. When
your brother's body...

962
02:56:41,506 --> 02:56:45,285
...was taken to Kabul,
by a valiant Pathan!

963
02:56:47,656 --> 02:56:51,955
Do you know who this demented
woman is? Benazir!

964
02:56:55,177 --> 02:56:57,722
- Badshah Khan's wife?
- Yes!

965
02:57:00,186 --> 02:57:03,662
An innocent picture of
the crimes you committed.

966
02:57:05,263 --> 02:57:08,974
And this is Badshah Khan's
bosom friend, Khuda Bux!

967
02:57:12,898 --> 02:57:16,369
And this is Jailer Ranvir's
daughter, Hena.

968
02:57:18,715 --> 02:57:23,704
Look at her. She's Badshah
Khan's daughter...

969
02:57:26,677 --> 02:57:31,336
See if you know me too.
You also owe me something.

970
02:57:31,644 --> 02:57:35,546
- What do I owe you, son?
- Aren't you that same devil...

971
02:57:35,689 --> 02:57:39,966
...who had filled my father's
veins with liquor?

972
02:57:40,302 --> 02:57:44,706
Recognize me, Pasha.
I'm Aziz Mirza's son!

973
02:57:56,266 --> 02:58:01,008
You are Aziz Mirza's son?

974
02:58:02,238 --> 02:58:07,205
You're my friend's son.
Oh, my dear Aziz!

975
02:58:08,974 --> 02:58:12,153
Please accept my hand of friendship.

976
02:58:12,258 --> 02:58:18,650
Else kill me. Kill me.

977
02:58:18,992 --> 02:58:23,471
O, Aziz, my friend.
Your son, my foe?

978
02:58:23,472 --> 02:58:26,949
I can't bear this!
No, I just can't.

979
02:58:27,919 --> 02:58:33,624
It's better to die than to lead
such a life. Kill me!

980
02:59:00,988 --> 02:59:04,458
- You rascal!
- My dear friend...

981
02:59:05,065 --> 02:59:08,308
It doesn't take much time for
one's luck and times to change!

982
02:59:09,241 --> 02:59:13,015
This trick that I did now...
Do you know who I learnt this from?

983
02:59:14,773 --> 02:59:18,547
Badshah Khan! Her Badshah Khan!

984
02:59:20,783 --> 02:59:26,004
Isn't she the beauty for whom
my brother had to lose his life?

985
02:59:26,800 --> 02:59:31,072
If not Badshah Khan...
She's here.

986
02:59:32,334 --> 02:59:37,105
After calling out to my brother
I'll put a noose around her neck...

987
02:59:37,106 --> 02:59:40,319
...and pull so hard, that,
she'll go black all over!

988
02:59:42,144 --> 02:59:44,855
Your lover won't even know you!

989
02:59:47,976 --> 02:59:52,642
He'll come! He'll come!

990
02:59:52,811 --> 02:59:54,995
Sure he'll come.

991
02:59:55,134 --> 02:59:57,247
Of course he'll come!

992
03:00:47,850 --> 03:00:54,935
He... He has come!

993
03:01:13,430 --> 03:01:16,145
O Lord!

994
03:03:38,365 --> 03:03:42,196
Get up, my dear friend. Get up!

995
03:03:43,302 --> 03:03:48,071
Hey Badshah Khan,
Before your darling Benazir.

996
03:03:48,271 --> 03:03:50,286
Have you breathed your last?

997
03:03:54,551 --> 03:03:58,408
When wind becomes a shield and
protects a flame...

998
03:03:58,548 --> 03:04:02,481
Who can douse a flame which
is lit by the Lord?

999
03:04:48,978 --> 03:04:56,031
Shoot me! Strew...
...my path with fire.

1000
03:04:56,962 --> 03:05:02,027
Erect a wall of embers from
the earth to the sky.

1001
03:05:03,028 --> 03:05:07,332
Riddle my chest with bullets.
Love...

1002
03:05:07,600 --> 03:05:10,506
...will still find its goal!
