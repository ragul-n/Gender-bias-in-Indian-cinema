1
00:00:59,375 --> 00:01:02,417
<i>This land has given birth</i>
<i>to countless warriors.</i>

2
00:01:03,292 --> 00:01:05,708
<i>But history classified them either as</i>

3
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,500
<i>the victorious or the defeated.</i>

4
00:01:09,458 --> 00:01:12,458
<i>The Battle of Panipat was such that</i>

5
00:01:12,583 --> 00:01:16,500
<i>even history could not classify it</i>
<i>as victory or defeat.</i>

6
00:01:17,708 --> 00:01:19,500
<i>The Third Battle of Panipat</i>

7
00:01:20,042 --> 00:01:22,583
<i>which I was witness to.</i>

8
00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:26,583
<i>I did not shy away from taking</i>
<i>a bold step and braving the heat.</i>

9
00:01:27,417 --> 00:01:30,458
<i>I too was accompanying the storm</i>

10
00:01:30,583 --> 00:01:33,125
<i>that was set out to vanquish the enemy.</i>

11
00:01:33,792 --> 00:01:37,083
<i>Sadashiv Rao Bhau, my husband and my Lord!</i>

12
00:01:37,875 --> 00:01:41,833
<i>The state of affairs</i>
<i>before this battle were as such.</i>

13
00:01:42,458 --> 00:01:48,125
<i>By 1758, the Maratha flag fluttered</i>
<i>high across all of Hindostan</i>

14
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:51,625
<i>right up to Attock Fort</i>
<i>at the Afghan border.</i>

15
00:01:52,458 --> 00:01:54,833
<i>If there was anyone we could not defeat,</i>

16
00:01:54,958 --> 00:01:57,625
<i>it was our neighboring</i>
<i>kingdom of the Nizam Sultanate</i>

17
00:01:58,042 --> 00:02:01,375
<i>whose capital was Udgiri Fort</i>

18
00:02:01,458 --> 00:02:03,792
<i>which the Marathas had surrounded.</i>

19
00:02:09,958 --> 00:02:11,333
Fire!

20
00:02:13,208 --> 00:02:14,583
Fire!

21
00:02:18,958 --> 00:02:22,958
Take the cannons back! Move back!

22
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:37,000
Artillerymen!
Tilt all 40 cannons, two inches up!

23
00:02:37,125 --> 00:02:38,625
Yes, sir!

24
00:02:41,333 --> 00:02:43,958
How much longer
will we have to wait, Shamsher?

25
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:52,375
Sadashiv said until we don't get the
signal, the cannons should keep firing.

26
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:57,292
I warned Sadashiv that guerrilla warfare
won't work here!

27
00:02:57,417 --> 00:03:00,500
But he wouldn't listen.
He wants to have it his way!

28
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:05,167
Raghoba, I have faith in Sadashiv.

29
00:03:15,667 --> 00:03:18,833
By the grace of Lord Jyotiba,
let all be well.

30
00:03:22,417 --> 00:03:25,375
Hail Goddess Bhawani!

31
00:04:48,417 --> 00:04:50,250
-Bhau.
-Mehendale.

32
00:04:53,417 --> 00:04:55,167
Go and get to the main courtyard.

33
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:57,167
I'll take this route.

34
00:04:57,708 --> 00:05:01,500
Signal the cavalry.
We have to open the main gate at once.

35
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,708
Go, quickly.
There's no time to lose.

36
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,958
Let's go!

37
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:12,167
The torch is lit.

38
00:05:15,542 --> 00:05:17,500
Cannons ready!

39
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,875
Shamsher! Let's go!

40
00:05:55,042 --> 00:05:57,542
The Chief of Artillery,
Ibrahim Khan Gardi.

41
00:06:02,542 --> 00:06:06,667
Ibrahim Khan, should we imprison you
or bury you?

42
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:09,250
None of that.

43
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:13,667
We should induct him into the Peshwa army.

44
00:06:14,917 --> 00:06:15,875
What?

45
00:06:17,167 --> 00:06:21,417
Do you not know that he is a Gardi!
He cannot be trusted.

46
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,083
They are known for switching loyalties.

47
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:28,083
An individual can be good or bad, Raghoba.

48
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:34,083
But it's unfair to blame the entire
community. And by the way, Raghoba,

49
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:38,333
name one community in which
there hasn't been a traitor.

50
00:06:43,792 --> 00:06:47,542
His cannons are now ours!
Then why do we need him?

51
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:49,583
Without him, his cannons are useless.

52
00:06:50,542 --> 00:06:54,333
We may as well melt the cannons for iron.

53
00:06:55,167 --> 00:06:57,625
When your decision is proven wrong

54
00:06:58,375 --> 00:07:00,375
be ready to face the wrath of Nana Saheb!

55
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:13,917
-Hail...
-Mahadev!

56
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:05,792
Move aside. Let me pass.

57
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:15,333
-Parvati, what are you doing?
-I'm welcoming you.

58
00:08:15,667 --> 00:08:18,833
Can a commoner not welcome an elite?

59
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:23,000
Yes of course, why not.

60
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:27,375
Look here.

61
00:08:30,958 --> 00:08:31,958
Be still.

62
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:35,542
My Lord...

63
00:08:37,167 --> 00:08:38,167
Don't call me that.

64
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:40,500
I'm not your Lord.

65
00:08:41,792 --> 00:08:42,667
Not yet.

66
00:08:46,667 --> 00:08:49,458
Oh, God! You're hurt!

67
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:51,167
It's nothing much.

68
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,542
<i>When a brave warrior</i>
<i>returns from the battle,</i>

69
00:08:56,917 --> 00:09:01,500
<i>he tries to hide his wounds</i>
<i>and his emotions.</i>

70
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:07,875
<i>But how can he hide it from the one</i>
<i>who can see through him!</i>

71
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:15,708
Grandmother, how are you?

72
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:19,708
Sadashiv, I couldn't be there
at the main gate to receive you.

73
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:22,000
-My health...
-Don't worry, Grandma.

74
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:25,250
-Let me take your blessings.
-Bless you, my child.

75
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:28,000
Live long!

76
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:30,083
Come.

77
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:32,750
Careful.

78
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:38,833
We won, Grandmother.
We were victorious!

79
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:41,250
The Nizam has been crushed.

80
00:09:42,417 --> 00:09:43,667
I had faith in you.

81
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:47,583
You have never returned defeated!

82
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:54,333
-Bhanu...
-Yes, My Lady.

83
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:56,625
-Summon the doctor.
-All right.

84
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:58,583
Grandmother...

85
00:09:59,667 --> 00:10:01,583
Your father would always say,

86
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:06,667
"The greatest warriors are the ones
that fight no matter the condition.

87
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:09,958
They carry their heads high.

88
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:15,125
Their religion is bravery,
their duty is bravery.

89
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:19,083
Win or lose, they do not worry!"

90
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:23,625
Father was right!

91
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,583
Greetings, My Lady.

92
00:10:30,542 --> 00:10:32,000
I'll take your leave.

93
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Don't leave without nursing your wound!

94
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:39,667
Do you remember Parvati?

95
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:45,833
She has now become a royal doctor.
Making her father proud.

96
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,667
Congratulations on your victory,
Bhau sahib!

97
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:52,417
Thank you.

98
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:54,292
Where are you hurt?

99
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:06,667
Shall I begin?

100
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,083
Yes.

101
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:17,042
You? A doctor?

102
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:20,542
Why? Can a girl not be a doctor?

103
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:22,500
Is there such a rule?

104
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:24,375
No, of course, you can.

105
00:11:26,542 --> 00:11:29,458
But when we last met, you were not one.

106
00:11:31,167 --> 00:11:35,458
The last time we met was two years,
three months and 18 days ago.

107
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:38,625
Do you even remember?

108
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:50,083
Now hurry up.
He has to be present in the Ganesh Court.

109
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:51,458
Yes, My Lady.

110
00:11:53,417 --> 00:11:54,625
Done?

111
00:11:57,583 --> 00:11:58,500
Done.

112
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:04,542
<i>Bhau sahib!</i>

113
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:10,083
You must visit me twice a day,
to have the wound dressed.

114
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:24,208
Bhanu!

115
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:35,500
After capturing the Nizam's fort
in Udgiri, coming from the south

116
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:41,583
our brave warriors, unvanquished

117
00:12:41,667 --> 00:12:43,458
the glory of the Marathas,

118
00:12:43,542 --> 00:12:49,000
the honor of
the Peshwas, victors of the battlefield!

119
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:54,083
-All hail the Maratha Empire!
-Hail!

120
00:12:57,375 --> 00:13:01,083
The Peshwa regime applauds
the war efforts of the Peshwa's brother

121
00:13:01,167 --> 00:13:04,000
His Majesty Raghunath Rao!

122
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:04,958
Brother!

123
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:14,208
And now the honor is for
the Peshwa's cousin,

124
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:19,500
son of His Majesty Bajirao and Mastani,
Shamsher Bahadur!

125
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:26,333
The Peshwa regime applauds
the war efforts of the Peshwa's cousin,

126
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:30,917
His Majesty Sadashiv Rao Bhau!

127
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:33,417
You are the jewel in my crown!

128
00:13:35,042 --> 00:13:36,875
Uncle, this is for you!

129
00:13:38,292 --> 00:13:39,292
Vishwas!

130
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:49,250
Your Highness, may I present before you...

131
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:54,625
the Chief of Artillery of the Nizams'

132
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:56,583
Ibrahim Khan Gardi!

133
00:13:58,167 --> 00:14:01,292
Who has now been inducted
into the service of the Peshwas.

134
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,417
Your Highness,

135
00:14:07,083 --> 00:14:10,667
I served the Nizam for 30 years
and never did I leave their side.

136
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:14,125
But now that the Nizam is no more,

137
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:18,708
I, Ibrahim Khan Gardi,

138
00:14:20,042 --> 00:14:25,625
swear my allegiance to the Peshwa regime!

139
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:52,583
They have achieved what
none of the Peshwas could do before.

140
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,292
Liberating the south

141
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:59,000
was the unrealized dream of our beloved
Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj!

142
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:03,333
Today, 80 years after his passing,

143
00:15:04,042 --> 00:15:06,333
Nizam has been brought to its knees!

144
00:15:06,917 --> 00:15:11,208
Father.
Does this not call for a celebration?

145
00:15:12,417 --> 00:15:16,333
We are now the rulers of all of Hindostan!

146
00:15:17,042 --> 00:15:19,250
Of course, this calls for a celebration!

147
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:25,417
Invite all of our Commanders-in-chief
and Generals from outside of Pune.

148
00:15:26,542 --> 00:15:30,375
From Bundelkhand,
Sardar Govind Pant Bundele!

149
00:15:32,292 --> 00:15:34,917
Sardar Balwant Rao Mehendale!

150
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:39,167
From Gwalior, Sardar Jankoji Shinde!

151
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:42,833
And Sardar Dattaji Shinde!

152
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:47,292
From Indore, Sardar Malhar Rao Holkar!

153
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:55,208
<i>The earth cheers gloriously</i>
<i>And the skies echo</i>

154
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:03,792
<i>As our beloved flag</i>

155
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:06,792
<i>Flutters sky high</i>

156
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:16,292
<i>We are warriors, the fearless ones</i>
<i>Any direction we stride</i>

157
00:16:16,917 --> 00:16:22,000
<i>The paths sing our glory</i>
<i>And mountains make way for us</i>

158
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:27,542
<i>No one dares cross our path</i>
<i>Be it the rivers or the wind</i>

159
00:16:27,667 --> 00:16:32,875
<i>We're brave hearts, who step</i>
<i>In the battlefield only to win</i>

160
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:37,875
<i>We're the sun that</i>
<i>Banishes darkness</i>

161
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:44,417
<i>We're the ones who broke</i>
<i>The millennial chains of bondage</i>

162
00:16:44,542 --> 00:16:49,792
<i>The world resonated with the sound</i>
<i>"Hail Brave Marathas!"</i>

163
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:52,583
<i>The blood that courses</i>
<i>Through these veins</i>

164
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:55,458
<i>Keeps reminding us</i>

165
00:16:55,583 --> 00:17:01,500
<i>Laying down your life for respect</i>
<i>And honor is a small price to pay</i>

166
00:17:01,583 --> 00:17:06,917
<i>We're the ones who broke</i>
<i>The millennial chains of bondage</i>

167
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:12,625
<i>The world resonated with the sound</i>
<i>"Hail Brave Marathas!"</i>

168
00:17:12,708 --> 00:17:18,250
<i>We're the ones who broke</i>
<i>The millennial chains of bondage</i>

169
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:23,750
<i>The world resonated with the sound</i>
<i>"Hail Brave Marathas!"</i>

170
00:17:36,042 --> 00:17:40,583
<i>We sowed the seeds of bravery</i>
<i>And reaped the harvest</i>

171
00:17:41,667 --> 00:17:46,375
<i>Our glory is spread far and wide</i>

172
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:57,500
<i>We perform the dance of death</i>
<i>In the battlefield</i>

173
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:03,542
<i>Echoed by the drums of victory</i>

174
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:08,792
<i>Our tales of courage</i>
<i>Will now be told by time</i>

175
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:14,583
<i>Telling all, about</i>
<i>How we spread happiness</i>

176
00:18:14,667 --> 00:18:20,458
<i>We're the ones who broke</i>
<i>The millennial chains of bondage</i>

177
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:25,667
<i>The world resonated with the sound</i>
<i>"Hail Brave Marathas!"</i>

178
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:31,750
<i>We're the ones who broke</i>
<i>The millennial chains of bondage</i>

179
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:36,750
<i>The world resonated with the sound</i>
<i>"Hail Brave Marathas!"</i>

180
00:19:00,042 --> 00:19:05,000
<i>Defender of truth, handsome traveler</i>
<i>Little do you know</i>

181
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:10,375
<i>When you aren't around</i>
<i>We too are lost in a world of our own</i>

182
00:19:11,458 --> 00:19:16,375
<i>You were on my mind</i>
<i>In my heart, forever and ever</i>

183
00:19:16,917 --> 00:19:22,042
<i>When arrows rained at you</i>
<i>I too was wounded</i>

184
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:29,000
<i>For you, I can lay down my life</i>

185
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:33,458
<i>Don't you know that?</i>

186
00:19:34,042 --> 00:19:38,958
<i>When faced with a dilemma</i>
<i>Women rise, filled with courage</i>

187
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:45,125
<i>Sheds her bangles and bracelets</i>
<i>And draws a sword</i>

188
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:52,042
<i>I too have taken an oath today</i>
<i>To follow in the footsteps of the brave</i>

189
00:19:57,167 --> 00:20:03,708
<i>When I'll make a resolution</i>
<i>I'll never waver from it</i>

190
00:20:08,542 --> 00:20:13,375
<i>We are warriors, the fearless ones</i>
<i>Any direction we stride</i>

191
00:20:14,042 --> 00:20:19,042
<i>The paths sing our glory</i>
<i>And mountains make way for us</i>

192
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:24,958
<i>No one dares cross our path</i>
<i>Be it the rivers or the wind</i>

193
00:20:25,042 --> 00:20:30,333
<i>We're brave-hearts, who step</i>
<i>In the battlefield only to win</i>

194
00:20:30,417 --> 00:20:36,000
<i>We're the sun that banishes darkness</i>

195
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:41,708
<i>We're the ones who broke</i>
<i>The millennial chains of bondage</i>

196
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:46,917
<i>The world resonated with the sound</i>
<i>"Hail Brave Marathas!"</i>

197
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,833
<i>The blood that courses</i>
<i>Through these veins</i>

198
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:52,250
<i>Keeps reminding us</i>

199
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:58,708
<i>Laying down your life for respect</i>
<i>And honor is a small price to pay</i>

200
00:20:58,792 --> 00:21:04,292
<i>We're the ones who broke</i>
<i>The millennial chains of bondage</i>

201
00:21:04,375 --> 00:21:09,917
<i>The world resonated with the sound</i>
<i>"Hail Brave Marathas!"</i>

202
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,292
<i>We're the ones who broke</i>
<i>The millennial chains of bondage</i>

203
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:20,833
<i>The world resonated with the sound</i>
<i>"Hail Brave Marathas!"</i>

204
00:21:20,917 --> 00:21:25,042
His Highness Nana Saheb Peshwa
will now be presented the Peshwa sword!

205
00:21:55,167 --> 00:21:56,167
My Lord.

206
00:21:58,708 --> 00:22:00,500
-Leave us.
-Yes, My Lady.

207
00:22:08,375 --> 00:22:13,208
Lord, why did you present the Peshwa sword
to Sadashiv during the Weapons' Ceremony?

208
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:16,000
Why did you have to do that?

209
00:22:17,417 --> 00:22:19,833
Why are you giving Sadashiv
so much importance?

210
00:22:19,917 --> 00:22:22,875
Because he is the one
who has defeated the Nizam.

211
00:22:24,125 --> 00:22:25,333
What is bothering you?

212
00:22:25,625 --> 00:22:27,917
He's begun thinking of himself
as a Peshwa!

213
00:22:29,208 --> 00:22:33,833
At Udgiri, he recruited that Muslim
General without Raghoba's approval.

214
00:22:33,917 --> 00:22:37,792
That Muslim officer happens to be
the best artilleryman in all of Hindostan.

215
00:22:37,958 --> 00:22:41,458
Even in Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj's army
there were Muslims.

216
00:22:41,542 --> 00:22:44,417
My Lord, you're missing the point!

217
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,875
Today Sadashiv overruled Raghoba,
tomorrow it could be you!

218
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,667
You're missing the point here.

219
00:22:53,125 --> 00:22:57,042
Sadashiv only acts in
the best interest of the Maratha Empire!

220
00:22:58,458 --> 00:23:00,458
God forbid, if anything happens to you

221
00:23:01,333 --> 00:23:05,625
and he decides to become a Peshwa "in
the best interest of the Maratha Empire",

222
00:23:06,292 --> 00:23:09,417
where will that leave our son, Vishwas?

223
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,708
Raghoba has always
been my source of worry...

224
00:23:13,792 --> 00:23:14,708
and now Sadashiv!

225
00:23:15,208 --> 00:23:17,167
I have complete faith in his loyalty.

226
00:23:18,708 --> 00:23:21,167
He dotes on your boy.

227
00:23:22,042 --> 00:23:24,417
And Vishwas loves him just as much.

228
00:23:24,917 --> 00:23:29,208
Vishwas is just a child,
but I am surprised at your naivety.

229
00:23:31,333 --> 00:23:33,958
So, what do you wish?
What shall I do?

230
00:23:34,833 --> 00:23:38,333
You want me to tell you that too?
Who's the Peshwa? You or me?

231
00:23:41,042 --> 00:23:46,167
All these battles have thrown
our empire into a financial mess.

232
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:49,750
-Yes, that is true.
-You're intelligent,

233
00:23:50,958 --> 00:23:55,000
trustworthy and a taskmaster.

234
00:23:55,917 --> 00:23:57,375
Only you can do this.

235
00:23:57,458 --> 00:23:59,958
What do I have to do, My Lord?

236
00:24:01,083 --> 00:24:03,292
I appoint you as the Finance Minister.

237
00:24:09,208 --> 00:24:10,208
Finance Minister?

238
00:24:10,958 --> 00:24:12,333
And who will do my job?

239
00:24:15,333 --> 00:24:17,125
It's a good idea, Your Majesty.

240
00:24:17,208 --> 00:24:19,792
That way, Sadashiv will be stationed here
in Pune.

241
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:24,083
After all, a strong warrior is needed
to protect the capital.

242
00:24:24,167 --> 00:24:27,167
-But Raghoba is here too.
-Two are better than one!

243
00:24:33,042 --> 00:24:34,875
Gunoji will provide you
with the information.

244
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:48,583
Since the decision has already been taken,
I will obey you, Your Majesty.

245
00:24:50,375 --> 00:24:51,333
This is great!

246
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,500
Now I can learn the art of war from you.

247
00:24:54,625 --> 00:24:57,958
And I'll also learn how you do
1500 push-ups.

248
00:25:15,917 --> 00:25:16,875
I'll be back.

249
00:25:30,958 --> 00:25:36,542
Oh God, after climbing seven stories
I finally made it... to you!

250
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,542
I heard you're the Finance Minister now!

251
00:25:48,083 --> 00:25:48,917
That's good!

252
00:25:50,333 --> 00:25:53,042
Something tells me
you will excel even in this.

253
00:26:01,833 --> 00:26:04,500
To tell you the truth... I'm really happy.

254
00:26:05,083 --> 00:26:06,958
You're always away at battle!

255
00:26:07,042 --> 00:26:09,708
Finally, you will spend more time here.

256
00:26:12,375 --> 00:26:13,708
There's a saying.

257
00:26:15,167 --> 00:26:17,833
"You cannot separate
a warrior from his sword."

258
00:26:18,708 --> 00:26:20,375
Who knows that better than me?

259
00:26:24,208 --> 00:26:26,458
I can see what you're trying to do.
Stop it.

260
00:26:27,083 --> 00:26:29,625
Try as much as you want,
but come to terms with the fact

261
00:26:29,833 --> 00:26:32,375
that I am not ready for marriage!
Why don't you understand?

262
00:26:32,458 --> 00:26:35,125
What is there to understand?
It's not in your hands anymore.

263
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:37,250
I have gone through penance

264
00:26:37,375 --> 00:26:40,667
and I have fasted for 108 days.
Do you even know?

265
00:26:41,208 --> 00:26:42,958
Now I'm not going to let go.

266
00:26:43,958 --> 00:26:44,833
Just you watch.

267
00:26:46,333 --> 00:26:48,958
You will be mine.
That day is not far.

268
00:26:50,708 --> 00:26:51,583
Let me see.

269
00:26:54,208 --> 00:26:55,583
The wound is healing!

270
00:26:58,083 --> 00:27:00,292
So, do you have to be injured
to see me again?

271
00:27:00,375 --> 00:27:02,250
That's enough, Parvati! Now stop this!

272
00:27:10,875 --> 00:27:11,708
Parvati.

273
00:27:13,625 --> 00:27:14,625
Parvati.

274
00:27:17,125 --> 00:27:17,958
Parvati.

275
00:27:25,875 --> 00:27:28,042
-Isn't that...
-Parvati!

276
00:27:29,375 --> 00:27:30,750
With Sadashiv?

277
00:27:33,458 --> 00:27:38,250
Looks like an ordinary doctor
is dreaming of becoming a Queen.

278
00:27:38,833 --> 00:27:42,292
Oh, really?
I won't let that happen.

279
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,042
How much tax does
the Maratha Empire receive?

280
00:27:54,875 --> 00:27:58,042
The kingdoms under us give us
one-fourth of their earnings.

281
00:27:58,792 --> 00:28:03,167
But there are some in the north
that make excuses and do not pay up.

282
00:28:05,208 --> 00:28:07,625
Write to them all a letter
as a final warning.

283
00:28:09,167 --> 00:28:10,250
I'll sign it myself.

284
00:28:13,792 --> 00:28:16,708
One of our debtors
is being extremely difficult, sir.

285
00:28:17,583 --> 00:28:19,000
And he owes us the most tax.

286
00:28:20,583 --> 00:28:22,417
-Who is that?
-Najib-ud-Daula.

287
00:28:23,417 --> 00:28:25,000
The Mughals' Head of Military.

288
00:28:25,583 --> 00:28:28,250
Yes, but he stays in the Doab region

289
00:28:28,833 --> 00:28:31,542
between the Ganga and the Yamuna,
in Rohillabad Fort.

290
00:28:32,458 --> 00:28:37,125
After countless letters, he has
still not paid up. He keeps evading.

291
00:28:40,208 --> 00:28:42,500
We've tried convincing him formally.

292
00:28:43,083 --> 00:28:44,542
It's now time to use force.

293
00:28:45,167 --> 00:28:48,458
You're here.
How are you going to use force?

294
00:28:49,417 --> 00:28:51,417
We can send Dattaji Shinde.

295
00:28:52,125 --> 00:28:54,042
He's our greatest General in the north.

296
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,250
Dattaji will surely teach Najib a lesson.

297
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,583
And prepare another decree
for the Mughals.

298
00:29:05,083 --> 00:29:06,042
Yes, sir.

299
00:29:17,375 --> 00:29:21,333
"According to this Ahmadiyya Treaty,
if the Mughal Empire wants to

300
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:26,417
continue receiving protection
from the Marathas against invaders,

301
00:29:26,833 --> 00:29:29,583
then you will have to pay
one-fourth of your revenue

302
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:31,583
which you have not yet..."

303
00:29:40,333 --> 00:29:42,167
The treaty will be honored.

304
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:43,833
Your Majesty...

305
00:29:44,583 --> 00:29:48,333
do not get bullied by these Marathas.
We--

306
00:29:48,417 --> 00:29:51,833
Wait, Najib! Don't be impatient.

307
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,375
There is more in the decree.

308
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:04,458
"And on observing
Najib-ud-Daula's disobedience,

309
00:30:04,542 --> 00:30:09,833
he is evicted from the Mughal court
and his post of Military Head.

310
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,958
Signed. Sadashiv Rao Bhau Peshwa."

311
00:30:31,417 --> 00:30:32,583
Disperse.

312
00:30:41,167 --> 00:30:42,458
Najib-ud-Daula.

313
00:30:43,042 --> 00:30:47,333
Your Majesty,
how dare the Marathas remove me!

314
00:30:49,375 --> 00:30:50,583
What could I do?

315
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:55,125
After all, we need their solicitude.

316
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:58,542
But Your Majesty, that does not mean
they can order us around.

317
00:30:59,583 --> 00:31:02,708
Because of their backing,
Imad-ul-Mulk is behaving out of line.

318
00:31:03,708 --> 00:31:07,625
I'm shocked at the way he treats you

319
00:31:08,375 --> 00:31:11,958
especially when he knows you have
royal blood running through your veins.

320
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,917
I am alive today
because of this "royal blood."

321
00:31:19,292 --> 00:31:22,375
Your Majesty, Imad must be punished!

322
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:26,792
Who will punish him?

323
00:31:28,208 --> 00:31:30,292
The Marathas are backing him.

324
00:31:32,125 --> 00:31:37,917
And no one on this land will dare
go against the Marathas.

325
00:31:39,167 --> 00:31:40,875
There is one, Your Majesty.

326
00:31:41,708 --> 00:31:45,708
There is one person you can ask for help.

327
00:31:46,417 --> 00:31:47,750
Is there any such person?

328
00:31:51,708 --> 00:31:53,375
Ahmad Shah Abdali!

329
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:54,875
Abdali?

330
00:31:55,833 --> 00:31:56,917
Yes, Your Majesty.

331
00:31:57,333 --> 00:32:02,333
And then we'll teach these Marathas
a lesson.

332
00:32:20,042 --> 00:32:22,583
What happened? Come on.
You have five more to go.

333
00:32:27,542 --> 00:32:28,417
One...

334
00:32:30,167 --> 00:32:31,042
Two...

335
00:32:32,583 --> 00:32:33,500
Three...

336
00:32:35,542 --> 00:32:36,458
Four...

337
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:38,417
Five.

338
00:32:44,875 --> 00:32:49,000
Uncle, the day is not far
when I will be a warrior like you.

339
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:51,208
What is the use?

340
00:32:51,917 --> 00:32:55,583
Instead of drawing a sword
you will be writing accounts.

341
00:32:56,458 --> 00:33:00,125
Bhau, you never know
when we will be summoned for battle.

342
00:33:00,583 --> 00:33:02,542
If I had it my way, it would be never.

343
00:33:03,917 --> 00:33:04,917
Yes, Sister-in-law.

344
00:33:06,625 --> 00:33:07,458
Sister-in-law.

345
00:33:09,542 --> 00:33:10,750
Can I ask you something?

346
00:33:13,333 --> 00:33:14,583
Anything besides marriage.

347
00:33:15,583 --> 00:33:19,833
You can't dodge Mehram, Sadashiv.
Even I had to give in to her.

348
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:24,375
She's a good girl. Marry her.

349
00:33:26,375 --> 00:33:28,000
Marry? Whom?

350
00:33:28,583 --> 00:33:30,917
Oh, really?
Don't feign ignorance.

351
00:33:31,083 --> 00:33:32,042
It's Parvati!

352
00:33:33,333 --> 00:33:35,167
Sadashiv, Mehram is right.

353
00:33:35,792 --> 00:33:38,625
You've just returned from battle.
You have some time here.

354
00:33:39,333 --> 00:33:43,375
I don't have time for myself.
All my attention is on work.

355
00:33:44,375 --> 00:33:48,833
Bhau sahib, whether you're working
with a pen or a sword, it is only work.

356
00:33:49,917 --> 00:33:52,667
Whereas life begins when you go home.

357
00:33:56,667 --> 00:33:59,458
<i>Bhau sahib is entering the medical center.</i>

358
00:34:05,417 --> 00:34:06,333
Bhanu.

359
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:13,167
Where's Parvati?

360
00:34:13,958 --> 00:34:15,625
Now you remember her?

361
00:34:16,958 --> 00:34:17,792
What do you mean?

362
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:22,333
-She's gone!
-Gone?

363
00:34:23,833 --> 00:34:24,708
Gone where?

364
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,125
To her house in Pen, in Konkan!

365
00:34:30,292 --> 00:34:31,250
Konkan?

366
00:34:33,958 --> 00:34:35,458
What? Why?

367
00:34:36,792 --> 00:34:38,958
Why don't you go and ask her yourself?

368
00:34:42,917 --> 00:34:43,958
Shall I say something?

369
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:47,500
You are only brave in the battlefield,

370
00:34:48,167 --> 00:34:50,750
but in the matters of the heart,
you lack courage.

371
00:35:13,375 --> 00:35:14,958
She refused to meet you.

372
00:35:31,792 --> 00:35:32,667
Give this to her.

373
00:35:33,583 --> 00:35:34,667
Tell her I am wounded.

374
00:35:36,167 --> 00:35:40,667
You warriors are impossible.
Never want to shoot an arrow straight.

375
00:35:41,708 --> 00:35:42,583
Go.

376
00:35:43,708 --> 00:35:45,167
Quickly, Bhanu!

377
00:36:04,917 --> 00:36:05,875
Sir, you did this?

378
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:10,750
Sir? You never addressed me like that.

379
00:36:12,708 --> 00:36:14,750
You must be really mad.

380
00:36:16,792 --> 00:36:18,042
I did this, to see you.

381
00:36:19,083 --> 00:36:20,292
This was the only way.

382
00:36:23,833 --> 00:36:26,875
Now, are you not going to fulfill
your duties as a doctor?

383
00:36:32,292 --> 00:36:33,292
Give me the bandage.

384
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:41,208
I should not have raised my voice
the other day.

385
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:47,542
Forgive me. But why did you
have to leave without informing?

386
00:36:48,458 --> 00:36:52,208
I did not leave of my own accord.
I was told to.

387
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:54,417
By whom?

388
00:36:56,208 --> 00:36:57,250
Gopika Bai.

389
00:36:59,708 --> 00:37:00,667
Gopika Bai?

390
00:37:02,042 --> 00:37:05,750
Do you know, when I was 11 years old
my father brought me

391
00:37:06,667 --> 00:37:09,167
to Shaniwar Wada for the first time.

392
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,375
I saw you there.

393
00:37:13,708 --> 00:37:16,625
I didn't know who you were,
what your background was.

394
00:37:18,625 --> 00:37:22,042
But I just... fell in love with you.

395
00:37:25,625 --> 00:37:27,708
Later I found out you're a Peshwa.

396
00:37:29,417 --> 00:37:31,708
But you were always just Sadashiv for me.

397
00:37:36,792 --> 00:37:39,667
But now I have realized
how important status is.

398
00:37:40,958 --> 00:37:42,167
-Status?
-Yes!

399
00:37:43,417 --> 00:37:45,208
<i>Peshween</i> Gopika Bai is appalled at...

400
00:37:45,583 --> 00:37:50,458
how a girl from a different class
can live in Shaniwar Wada.

401
00:37:51,292 --> 00:37:52,250
Now I understand.

402
00:37:54,208 --> 00:37:57,417
And that's the very reason
you've been shunning me. Isn't it?

403
00:37:58,292 --> 00:37:59,583
You could just say it.

404
00:37:59,667 --> 00:38:03,167
Parvati, you're wrong.
I love you just as much as you...

405
00:38:10,125 --> 00:38:11,042
Then why?

406
00:38:19,542 --> 00:38:22,583
A warrior's family always leads
a life of uncertainty.

407
00:38:24,667 --> 00:38:26,792
Who knows that better than me?

408
00:38:29,042 --> 00:38:31,375
I never got to spend time with my father.

409
00:38:32,875 --> 00:38:34,792
He was always away at battle.

410
00:38:36,125 --> 00:38:39,417
And when I was very little,
he passed away.

411
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,375
I too am a warrior.

412
00:38:47,333 --> 00:38:52,500
And I do not want this repeated
with my wife, my child

413
00:38:54,292 --> 00:38:56,000
and my family.

414
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:00,458
How can you live your life
fearing the future?

415
00:39:03,208 --> 00:39:04,625
You are my present.

416
00:39:06,833 --> 00:39:07,917
What is your present?

417
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:13,375
I get it.

418
00:39:15,917 --> 00:39:17,542
-I should leave.
-Parvati.

419
00:39:20,333 --> 00:39:23,500
My today, my tomorrow,

420
00:39:26,375 --> 00:39:29,625
and every day that follows...

421
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:33,125
is with you.

422
00:39:38,375 --> 00:39:39,208
Really?

423
00:39:40,167 --> 00:39:41,042
Really!

424
00:40:04,125 --> 00:40:07,625
O Emperor of Afghanistan,
Leader of Leaders,

425
00:40:07,958 --> 00:40:10,833
this decision of yours
was proven to be correct.

426
00:40:13,292 --> 00:40:16,083
Now that the rebels have been crushed,

427
00:40:17,125 --> 00:40:20,792
no one will dare go against us!

428
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:48,208
Nonetheless, it's important
that we always stay alert.

429
00:41:03,792 --> 00:41:06,917
O Emperor of Afghanistan,
news from Hindostan!

430
00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:10,167
The Sultan of the Doab,
Najib-ud-Daula's brother,

431
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:13,542
Suleiman-ud-Daula,
would like to meet you.

432
00:41:24,458 --> 00:41:26,125
I can handle this!

433
00:41:49,167 --> 00:41:50,042
Murtuza?

434
00:41:52,958 --> 00:41:55,750
We grew up together.

435
00:41:57,625 --> 00:41:59,333
And you conspired to kill me?

436
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:01,917
For what?

437
00:42:05,542 --> 00:42:06,458
For this?

438
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:12,417
Emperor!

439
00:42:13,917 --> 00:42:14,792
Forgive him.

440
00:42:15,375 --> 00:42:20,167
Ahmad, please!
After all, he is our brother!

441
00:42:20,250 --> 00:42:26,500
Agreed, Sarfaraz! But before attacking me,
didn't Murtuza think about that?

442
00:42:26,792 --> 00:42:27,917
Ahmad...

443
00:42:28,542 --> 00:42:31,208
-forgive me!
-Do you not know?

444
00:42:32,667 --> 00:42:36,583
This Peacock Throne and the Koh-i-noor
are gained with great hardships.

445
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,417
It does not come easy!

446
00:42:40,417 --> 00:42:42,708
Nadir Shah tried to steal it!

447
00:42:44,583 --> 00:42:47,292
And paid for it with his life.

448
00:42:51,625 --> 00:42:54,375
I have earned it from Nadir.

449
00:42:55,375 --> 00:42:57,375
But I'll give it to you just like that.

450
00:42:58,917 --> 00:42:59,875
What do you want?

451
00:43:00,458 --> 00:43:01,292
Koh-i-noor?

452
00:43:02,958 --> 00:43:04,625
I'll give you the Koh-i-noor.

453
00:43:07,958 --> 00:43:09,625
No, Ahmad, no.

454
00:43:46,792 --> 00:43:51,583
-Emperor of Afghanistan...
-Long live!

455
00:43:52,125 --> 00:43:55,542
-Emperor of Afghanistan...
-Long live!

456
00:43:55,708 --> 00:43:59,542
Bring him outside.
I need fresh air.

457
00:44:19,083 --> 00:44:22,333
"Your Majesty, the Marathas
conquered Attock the last time.

458
00:44:22,833 --> 00:44:25,083
What if Kandahar is their next conquest?

459
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,750
The Emperor of Delhi
and the Hindu kings plead you.

460
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:35,042
You cannot waste another day.
Come, free us

461
00:44:35,375 --> 00:44:39,208
and become the Emperor of Hindostan
and take what is rightfully yours.

462
00:44:39,292 --> 00:44:42,542
Your obedient servant, Najib-ud-Daula."

463
00:44:44,125 --> 00:44:45,875
This is great news, Your Majesty!

464
00:44:46,917 --> 00:44:50,000
There are rich benefits
in conquering Delhi.

465
00:44:50,250 --> 00:44:51,875
Don't be too happy.

466
00:44:53,417 --> 00:44:56,083
Najib wants us to fight his battle.

467
00:44:58,250 --> 00:45:00,583
So that all the expenses of a war
will be on us.

468
00:45:02,042 --> 00:45:06,125
While he just sits there
and reaps the benefits of our takeover.

469
00:45:08,333 --> 00:45:11,125
And then he will want
to sit on the throne!

470
00:45:13,083 --> 00:45:14,208
He's a scoundrel!

471
00:45:14,917 --> 00:45:19,667
Your Majesty! I don't think
he will try that with you.

472
00:45:24,125 --> 00:45:29,250
A few considerations, Your Majesty.
Persia is trying to take over our kingdom.

473
00:45:30,250 --> 00:45:36,042
Your cousins and others are eyeing
the throne here. You just witnessed it.

474
00:45:37,458 --> 00:45:41,667
If you become the Emperor of Hindostan,
your empire will stretch until Bengal.

475
00:45:43,625 --> 00:45:48,917
Then the Persians will
not dare challenge you.

476
00:45:49,792 --> 00:45:51,708
Our coffers are getting empty too.

477
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:55,875
Don't worry about things here, Ahmad.
I will take care of it.

478
00:45:57,292 --> 00:46:00,542
Now is the time to conquer Delhi.

479
00:46:16,833 --> 00:46:17,958
To Hindostan we go!

480
00:47:00,042 --> 00:47:06,542
<i>Is this a dream or reality?</i>
<i>Is it a miracle or something else?</i>

481
00:47:09,833 --> 00:47:16,708
<i>A moment in time has come</i>
<i>To a standstill</i>

482
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:22,958
<i>I guess it was destiny</i>

483
00:47:23,042 --> 00:47:28,083
<i>You were meant for me</i>

484
00:47:28,208 --> 00:47:32,000
<i>And I was destined</i>

485
00:47:32,083 --> 00:47:36,250
<i>To be yours</i>

486
00:47:47,833 --> 00:47:50,375
Not even a cat
can climb a ladder this quickly.

487
00:47:53,125 --> 00:47:54,417
Congratulations!

488
00:48:44,792 --> 00:48:49,333
<i>The lost hope has re-awakened</i>

489
00:48:49,958 --> 00:48:54,000
<i>No one's around</i>
<i>Except for you and me</i>

490
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:59,667
<i>Our own little abode far-far away</i>

491
00:48:59,792 --> 00:49:04,708
<i>Is the only thing I ever wished for</i>

492
00:49:13,708 --> 00:49:17,958
<i>This heart of mine</i>

493
00:49:18,333 --> 00:49:23,250
<i>Is now your throne</i>

494
00:49:23,375 --> 00:49:28,000
<i>You are in my every breath</i>

495
00:49:28,125 --> 00:49:32,750
<i>And every heartbeat</i>

496
00:49:32,875 --> 00:49:37,625
<i>I guess it was destiny</i>

497
00:49:37,750 --> 00:49:42,458
<i>You were meant for me</i>

498
00:49:42,583 --> 00:49:47,167
<i>And I was destined</i>

499
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:51,667
<i>To be yours</i>

500
00:50:41,917 --> 00:50:44,458
Brother, what is the matter?

501
00:50:46,458 --> 00:50:48,042
Dattaji Shinde is no more.

502
00:50:50,167 --> 00:50:52,333
Dattaji? How?

503
00:50:53,667 --> 00:50:55,042
Najib-ud-Daula.

504
00:50:56,208 --> 00:50:58,458
He had gone to collect taxes from Najib.

505
00:50:59,042 --> 00:51:00,750
That's when he betrayed and killed him.

506
00:51:07,958 --> 00:51:13,167
So, you had announced
that you will take my head!

507
00:51:13,750 --> 00:51:16,542
Now, come on.
Take it. Take my head!

508
00:51:17,167 --> 00:51:19,083
You have already put your head...

509
00:51:20,958 --> 00:51:23,083
at Abdali's feet.

510
00:51:23,667 --> 00:51:25,083
What are you going to do now?

511
00:51:26,292 --> 00:51:27,250
Continue fighting?

512
00:51:28,042 --> 00:51:31,875
If I live... I will continue fighting!

513
00:51:39,208 --> 00:51:40,458
Najib!

514
00:51:44,250 --> 00:51:50,333
How could Najib dare to kill
a Maratha Sardar?

515
00:51:50,917 --> 00:51:53,292
Because he has allied with
Ahmad Shah Abdali.

516
00:51:55,208 --> 00:51:56,792
Ahmad Shah Abdali?

517
00:51:59,333 --> 00:52:03,208
Call all the Generals and courtiers
to the Ganesh Court immediately.

518
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:14,000
The assassination of Dattaji
is a direct attack on the Maratha Empire.

519
00:52:14,958 --> 00:52:18,792
Abdali's invasion means an assault
on all of Hindostan!

520
00:52:18,875 --> 00:52:21,417
He's invading with an army of 100,000.

521
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:24,250
The last time he caused so much bloodshed

522
00:52:24,667 --> 00:52:27,792
the Yamuna river
flowed red for seven days.

523
00:52:28,375 --> 00:52:31,792
This time we have to stop him.

524
00:52:34,208 --> 00:52:37,958
My Lord, Abdali is coming to take
over Red Fort, not our Shaniwar Wada.

525
00:52:38,875 --> 00:52:42,167
Why should we travel so far
up north to fight their battle?

526
00:52:42,250 --> 00:52:45,917
Because Delhi is not powerful enough
to defend itself from Abdali.

527
00:52:46,750 --> 00:52:48,042
And do not forget...

528
00:52:48,625 --> 00:52:53,667
In exchange for taxes, we have promised
to protect them from invaders.

529
00:52:54,833 --> 00:52:56,917
It is time to fulfill our duty.

530
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,042
-We cannot back out now.
-But Bhau sahib...

531
00:53:02,208 --> 00:53:07,750
My Lord, I would like to remind You
that we have just fought a battle.

532
00:53:08,208 --> 00:53:11,250
Our soldiers are so exhausted
that they can't lift their own armor.

533
00:53:11,333 --> 00:53:14,333
-We can't burden them with another battle.
-You are right.

534
00:53:15,542 --> 00:53:16,958
But there's no other option.

535
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,958
He's coming with an army of 100,000.

536
00:53:20,042 --> 00:53:24,167
Lingoji, if someone attacks your home,
what will you do first?

537
00:53:25,208 --> 00:53:29,417
Count their numbers? Or put all your
strength into stopping them? Tell me.

538
00:53:30,750 --> 00:53:31,625
Tell me.

539
00:53:33,042 --> 00:53:34,667
I agree with Sadashiv.

540
00:53:36,625 --> 00:53:38,167
We should send our army.

541
00:53:42,667 --> 00:53:43,542
All right.

542
00:53:44,542 --> 00:53:46,417
In that case, Raghoba should go.

543
00:53:48,458 --> 00:53:49,667
By all means, My Lord!

544
00:53:50,708 --> 00:53:52,750
Our horses have traversed
the Sindhu and Kaveri rivers.

545
00:53:52,833 --> 00:53:53,750
The Yamuna should not be a problem.

546
00:53:55,208 --> 00:53:58,667
I'll need a crore in gold
and an army of 80,000.

547
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:04,667
But Raghoba, the Peshwa treasury is weak!

548
00:54:05,792 --> 00:54:08,542
You will have to make do
with what we have.

549
00:54:09,250 --> 00:54:12,625
In that case...

550
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:16,500
what was he doing as the Finance Minister?

551
00:54:21,417 --> 00:54:25,458
Raghoba, you sure did take Attock Fort,
but you returned with a debt.

552
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:27,833
I have been wiping that out.

553
00:54:29,125 --> 00:54:34,542
Our enemies should be bankrupt, and our
empire should be the richest in Hindostan.

554
00:54:36,250 --> 00:54:37,542
It's just the opposite here.

555
00:54:39,792 --> 00:54:41,042
He is right, Raghoba!

556
00:54:41,625 --> 00:54:44,708
And Raghoba,
as far as the army is concerned,

557
00:54:46,208 --> 00:54:47,333
we need it here too.

558
00:54:49,042 --> 00:54:51,917
To protect Delhi, we cannot risk Pune.

559
00:54:52,708 --> 00:54:56,083
So you will have to make do
with an army of 40,000.

560
00:54:57,083 --> 00:54:58,000
Forty thousand?

561
00:54:59,292 --> 00:55:00,167
That's it?

562
00:55:01,125 --> 00:55:03,958
-Forty thousand isn't bad, Raghoba.
-What do you know?

563
00:55:09,167 --> 00:55:10,917
What do you know about the north?

564
00:55:12,375 --> 00:55:16,000
Just because you won Udgiri, you think
you know everything about warfare?

565
00:55:18,833 --> 00:55:21,083
Delhi is no child's play, Sadashiv Bhau.

566
00:55:23,792 --> 00:55:25,292
Your sword is rusted.

567
00:55:27,250 --> 00:55:32,542
And you can't fight Abdali
with your quill.

568
00:55:33,458 --> 00:55:36,333
Put a sword back in my hand and watch.

569
00:55:38,750 --> 00:55:39,583
Is that so?

570
00:55:43,167 --> 00:55:46,583
With no gold and an army of 40,000?
Can you do it?

571
00:55:48,542 --> 00:55:49,417
My Lord...

572
00:55:51,583 --> 00:55:52,875
give me the order.

573
00:55:53,833 --> 00:55:56,583
I will lead the campaign
with the same resources.

574
00:55:57,208 --> 00:56:01,792
And how are you going to do it with
negligible gold and a small army?

575
00:56:02,375 --> 00:56:03,833
My Lord, it is a long journey.

576
00:56:05,750 --> 00:56:09,125
I will ask for aid from all our
northern Generals such as Holkar,

577
00:56:09,625 --> 00:56:11,625
Shinde, Bundele.

578
00:56:12,708 --> 00:56:19,708
With their help, I will strike alliances
with the kingdoms we pass in the journey.

579
00:56:20,417 --> 00:56:23,375
-Will you be able to convince them?
-Yes, absolutely.

580
00:56:24,125 --> 00:56:25,750
They have always been our allies.

581
00:56:27,833 --> 00:56:29,833
And when we come face to face with Abdali,

582
00:56:30,125 --> 00:56:35,125
on seeing a large, united
Hindostani army, he will retreat.

583
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:40,000
And what if he stands his ground?

584
00:56:44,875 --> 00:56:46,333
Then, we will break his legs.

585
00:56:52,875 --> 00:56:53,875
It has been decided.

586
00:56:54,708 --> 00:56:58,708
Sadashiv Rao Bhau
will lead the Peshwa campaign.

587
00:57:03,042 --> 00:57:08,208
God willing,
may the Maratha flag fly high.

588
00:57:16,167 --> 00:57:19,750
Attock Fort is once again

589
00:57:19,833 --> 00:57:23,750
a part of the Durrani Sultanate!

590
00:57:23,833 --> 00:57:26,958
-Emperor of Afghanistan...
-Long live!

591
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:31,083
-Emperor of Afghanistan...
-Long live!

592
00:57:31,167 --> 00:57:36,208
-Emperor of Afghanistan...
-Long live!

593
00:57:49,083 --> 00:57:51,792
-How many gauntlet swords do we have?
-Twenty thousand!

594
00:57:53,917 --> 00:57:55,875
-And the spears?
-Five thousand!

595
00:57:57,083 --> 00:57:59,458
That's less!
Get 10,000 more made.

596
00:57:59,667 --> 00:58:02,500
-Yes, sir!
-<i>Peshween</i> Parvati Bai is here.

597
00:58:05,917 --> 00:58:07,042
Parvati, you're here!

598
00:58:07,875 --> 00:58:09,500
I mean, what are you doing here?

599
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:11,417
I...

600
00:58:11,792 --> 00:58:14,583
I wanted to see if your
weapons and armor were all right.

601
00:58:15,625 --> 00:58:17,167
That surely is not the reason.

602
00:58:19,333 --> 00:58:20,250
My Lord...

603
00:58:21,917 --> 00:58:24,250
-Leave us.
-Yes, My Lady.

604
00:58:24,333 --> 00:58:26,958
-Let me tie it.
-Yes, My Lady.

605
00:58:33,250 --> 00:58:34,750
I would like to come with you
on the expedition.

606
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:36,833
Why?

607
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,875
As a doctor,
I will be useful on the expedition.

608
00:58:41,750 --> 00:58:46,417
I will treat the sick
and heal the wounded.

609
00:58:46,667 --> 00:58:47,792
Give me your hand.

610
00:58:49,625 --> 00:58:51,958
You're right.
It is an expedition.

611
00:58:52,833 --> 00:58:56,583
But with the dangers of battle.
We can't afford to take families along.

612
00:58:56,667 --> 00:58:58,708
As a Finance Minister, don't you know

613
00:58:58,833 --> 00:59:02,625
the difference between assets
and liability? I'll be of great use there.

614
00:59:04,333 --> 00:59:06,667
Parvati, the expedition
will have hardships.

615
00:59:07,458 --> 00:59:09,292
Then, take me as your shield.

616
00:59:10,083 --> 00:59:13,917
In happy times, I'll be beside you
and in tough times, I'll protect you.

617
00:59:14,417 --> 00:59:16,125
We will be living in tents!

618
00:59:16,708 --> 00:59:19,792
A tent is more comfortable
than dealing with Gopika Bai's taunts.

619
00:59:28,083 --> 00:59:31,750
My Lord, I want to be with you.

620
00:59:32,375 --> 00:59:35,167
Whatever the problems,
I want us to face them together.

621
00:59:35,750 --> 00:59:36,667
And...

622
00:59:37,667 --> 00:59:38,542
And?

623
00:59:39,125 --> 00:59:40,250
And nothing.

624
00:59:42,292 --> 00:59:43,708
And what, Parvati?

625
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,042
I have heard when Peshwas
travel all alone,

626
00:59:47,125 --> 00:59:48,833
they often return with another queen.

627
01:00:05,458 --> 01:00:07,083
So, this is the real concern!

628
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,125
If that's the case

629
01:00:17,458 --> 01:00:20,167
then you're most welcome.

630
01:00:22,917 --> 01:00:24,667
But Parvati Bai, let me tell you...

631
01:00:27,125 --> 01:00:31,250
You and only you will be in my life,
forever!

632
01:00:38,333 --> 01:00:40,792
-My Lord, can I say something?
-What?

633
01:00:41,375 --> 01:00:43,000
How long will Vishwas remain a child?

634
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:47,792
He has to learn
what it takes to be the Peshwa.

635
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:49,333
What shall we do?

636
01:00:51,208 --> 01:00:53,583
Sadashiv will surely defeat Abdali.

637
01:00:54,708 --> 01:00:56,667
Then he will stake claim on Delhi

638
01:00:57,125 --> 01:00:59,250
and become the Emperor of Hindostan.

639
01:01:01,375 --> 01:01:02,958
All I am saying is...

640
01:01:04,125 --> 01:01:10,208
let's make our son the Supreme Commander
of the army Sadashiv is leading.

641
01:01:12,833 --> 01:01:15,458
Then it will be him
who will sit on Delhi's throne!

642
01:01:17,750 --> 01:01:19,167
Just imagine...

643
01:01:20,542 --> 01:01:26,042
Emperor of Hindostan,
His Majesty Vishwas Rao Peshwa.

644
01:01:36,583 --> 01:01:37,625
Vishwas?

645
01:01:38,958 --> 01:01:42,333
This is about Delhi and Abdali.
There can be serious consequences.

646
01:01:44,583 --> 01:01:49,458
Yes, but it will be a good learning
opportunity for the future Peshwa.

647
01:01:55,208 --> 01:01:56,125
Brother.

648
01:01:57,958 --> 01:02:01,417
Sister-in-law, I understand your concern!

649
01:02:02,292 --> 01:02:05,708
Rest assured, I have
no ambition of being on the throne.

650
01:02:08,542 --> 01:02:10,042
I will take Vishwas with me.

651
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,042
Assure me...

652
01:02:19,708 --> 01:02:21,000
you will protect him.

653
01:02:24,792 --> 01:02:26,042
With my life.

654
01:02:43,708 --> 01:02:47,292
This time, teach Abdali such a lesson...

655
01:02:48,542 --> 01:02:53,083
that he will not even dare
look in the direction of Hindostan.

656
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,708
Come back victorious.

657
01:03:02,083 --> 01:03:03,375
May God bless you.

658
01:03:14,542 --> 01:03:15,750
God bless you.

659
01:03:36,500 --> 01:03:37,667
To Delhi!

660
01:03:38,167 --> 01:03:40,292
-Hail...
-Mahadev!

661
01:03:50,333 --> 01:03:51,583
The Afghans have arrived.

662
01:03:59,208 --> 01:04:00,583
-Bring the loot.
-Yes, sir.

663
01:04:21,292 --> 01:04:25,958
Welcome, Emperor of Afghanistan!

664
01:04:27,833 --> 01:04:30,417
I am so happy to see you.

665
01:04:31,792 --> 01:04:38,000
Not only me but this land, its people,
all have been eagerly waiting for you.

666
01:04:38,708 --> 01:04:41,250
Hope you had a pleasant journey!

667
01:04:42,375 --> 01:04:45,292
Crossing five rivers is no easy journey.

668
01:04:49,792 --> 01:04:55,250
But it's worth it once I see
Hindostan's sweet fruits.

669
01:05:14,208 --> 01:05:16,625
The loot we gathered
by defeating Dattaji Shinde.

670
01:05:23,500 --> 01:05:24,667
Shinde and Holkar

671
01:05:24,750 --> 01:05:28,208
for the last two generations have been
the two wheels of the Maratha chariot.

672
01:05:28,292 --> 01:05:31,375
After killing Dattaji,
I've broken one wheel.

673
01:05:31,500 --> 01:05:34,208
The chariot will not
survive for long, Emperor.

674
01:05:35,042 --> 01:05:36,083
Excellent!

675
01:05:40,042 --> 01:05:43,417
-And I have some bad news for you.
-What is it?

676
01:05:44,667 --> 01:05:46,875
Mughal Emperor Alamgir II is no more.

677
01:05:50,792 --> 01:05:51,792
How did that happen?

678
01:05:53,042 --> 01:05:57,375
His wazir, Imad-ul-Mulk, intercepted
a letter written to you by His Majesty...

679
01:05:58,500 --> 01:05:59,542
Come, Your Majesty.

680
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:05,250
The <i>Pir </i>is in prayer right now.
Please sit.

681
01:06:22,458 --> 01:06:26,208
Forgive me, my Emperor.

682
01:06:31,667 --> 01:06:32,917
Who is on the throne now?

683
01:06:33,667 --> 01:06:38,125
Imad crowned another puppet.
Shah Jahan III.

684
01:06:39,208 --> 01:06:42,167
But now, after the news of your arrival,
Imad has absconded.

685
01:06:43,917 --> 01:06:46,083
Imad needs to be taught a lesson.

686
01:06:46,333 --> 01:06:50,208
Yes. I have already deployed
my Generals to look for him.

687
01:06:51,208 --> 01:06:52,333
Don't waste time.

688
01:06:53,708 --> 01:06:55,000
Let's march towards Delhi.

689
01:06:55,958 --> 01:06:59,125
I need to take the throne and the
treasures and return to Kandahar

690
01:06:59,708 --> 01:07:00,958
before the monsoons.

691
01:07:02,833 --> 01:07:04,125
I have a request.

692
01:07:05,875 --> 01:07:07,625
The Marathas won't keep quiet.

693
01:07:08,375 --> 01:07:12,083
Sadashiv is going to leave Pune
to take revenge for Dattaji's death.

694
01:07:12,917 --> 01:07:13,958
To stop us.

695
01:07:14,542 --> 01:07:17,958
Sadashiv? Who is that?

696
01:07:18,583 --> 01:07:20,125
The Peshwa's cousin brother.

697
01:07:20,667 --> 01:07:24,333
He will attack the Doab
and my Rohillabad Fort

698
01:07:24,417 --> 01:07:26,875
which you so painstakingly
acquired the last time.

699
01:07:27,333 --> 01:07:29,208
Only you can stop him.

700
01:07:31,833 --> 01:07:34,542
Doab? Rohillabad?

701
01:07:36,167 --> 01:07:40,250
You had said it is important
to stake a claim on Delhi right now.

702
01:07:43,292 --> 01:07:44,167
Don't worry.

703
01:07:44,583 --> 01:07:47,333
I have kept my General
in charge of Delhi.

704
01:07:47,875 --> 01:07:50,250
We will take Delhi,
but first, we have to stop them.

705
01:07:55,375 --> 01:07:57,125
Try and understand, Emperor.

706
01:07:57,792 --> 01:08:01,458
The Marathas are the only ones who can
challenge your claim to the throne.

707
01:08:01,792 --> 01:08:03,542
Once you defeat them...

708
01:08:04,333 --> 01:08:07,958
not only Delhi,
all of Hindostan will be yours.

709
01:08:08,875 --> 01:08:14,000
Najib, whatever is your plan,
if it goes wrong...

710
01:08:16,417 --> 01:08:18,083
you will not live.

711
01:08:18,833 --> 01:08:21,583
What are you saying, Emperor?

712
01:08:22,583 --> 01:08:23,708
You are my Emperor.

713
01:08:24,958 --> 01:08:27,542
My only wish is to serve you.

714
01:08:31,708 --> 01:08:33,292
How large is the Maratha army?

715
01:09:18,833 --> 01:09:19,667
Handle this.

716
01:09:20,750 --> 01:09:24,833
Bhanu, keep all the medicines
in this tent.

717
01:09:24,958 --> 01:09:25,833
Yes, Parvati Bai.

718
01:09:25,917 --> 01:09:27,667
-Come on, quickly.
-What's all this?

719
01:09:29,208 --> 01:09:30,958
You've brought
the whole of Shaniwar Wada along.

720
01:09:32,417 --> 01:09:33,250
What do you mean?

721
01:09:33,875 --> 01:09:35,875
Did you come to reduce my burden,
or increase them?

722
01:09:38,625 --> 01:09:40,458
These are all necessities, My Lord.

723
01:09:40,542 --> 01:09:43,083
Yes, but we are only
stopping here for a night.

724
01:09:44,875 --> 01:09:50,083
It will take all day to unpack,
then to pack everything up again.

725
01:09:51,375 --> 01:09:54,250
-You're unbelievable!
-It's a long journey...

726
01:09:54,333 --> 01:09:56,792
I had already told you
that it is a long journey.

727
01:09:57,042 --> 01:10:00,417
You won't be able to handle it.
You're too stubborn.

728
01:10:01,625 --> 01:10:02,875
You've packed everything!

729
01:10:04,917 --> 01:10:05,792
You're great!

730
01:10:07,167 --> 01:10:08,958
-Where do I keep this?
-On my head.

731
01:10:11,167 --> 01:10:13,000
-Keep it over there.
-Yes, My Lady.

732
01:10:38,958 --> 01:10:40,292
Wow!

733
01:10:42,917 --> 01:10:44,250
What a beautiful set-up.

734
01:10:52,750 --> 01:10:53,583
Parvati.

735
01:10:55,083 --> 01:10:56,875
-Parvati.
-Don't come close.

736
01:10:59,042 --> 01:10:59,875
Why?

737
01:11:00,458 --> 01:11:02,625
You kept questioning me out there,
Bhau sahib.

738
01:11:04,458 --> 01:11:07,417
-Parvati, I was just--
-Stop right there!

739
01:11:22,167 --> 01:11:23,125
Do not come closer.

740
01:11:24,583 --> 01:11:25,458
Is that so?

741
01:11:40,958 --> 01:11:41,875
Watch it!

742
01:11:50,250 --> 01:11:51,375
I'm watching.

743
01:11:56,250 --> 01:11:57,500
Can I tell you something?

744
01:11:59,083 --> 01:12:01,750
Today I've understood
what a home truly is.

745
01:12:06,708 --> 01:12:08,000
Forgive me, Parvati Bai!

746
01:12:09,333 --> 01:12:14,167
I made a mistake.
It's just that I'm newlywed.

747
01:12:18,083 --> 01:12:21,958
I forgive you.
Don't let it happen again!

748
01:12:32,250 --> 01:12:34,125
<i>As we set off towards the north</i>

749
01:12:34,250 --> 01:12:39,000
<i>the Maratha trumpets</i>
<i>spread the news of our expedition.</i>

750
01:12:39,625 --> 01:12:42,000
<i>The kings that had been notified</i>

751
01:12:42,083 --> 01:12:45,667
<i>started joining</i>
<i>His Majesty Vishwas Rao Peshwa's army.</i>

752
01:12:46,375 --> 01:12:49,708
This is not just your dream, but ours too.

753
01:12:50,292 --> 01:12:51,250
We are with you.

754
01:12:53,958 --> 01:12:57,000
Thank you, King Karamveer.
We gladly accept.

755
01:13:04,458 --> 01:13:07,833
We would like to join your expedition!

756
01:13:08,958 --> 01:13:11,208
We are glad. Thank you.

757
01:13:14,417 --> 01:13:17,792
<i>After a month, having traversed</i>
<i>jungles, mountains,</i>

758
01:13:17,875 --> 01:13:22,625
<i>and after crossing mighty rivers like the</i>
<i>Narmada and Chambal, we reached Dhaulpur.</i>

759
01:13:22,958 --> 01:13:26,375
<i>Where our Maratha Generals awaited us.</i>

760
01:13:30,042 --> 01:13:31,792
Welcome... welcome...

761
01:13:36,292 --> 01:13:39,875
<i>Peshween</i> Parvati Bai,
<i>Peshween</i> Radhika Bai and Mehram Bai.

762
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:42,083
Sister-in-law,

763
01:13:43,375 --> 01:13:48,000
I have fought with the fathers
of these men, shoulder to shoulder.

764
01:13:51,917 --> 01:13:54,958
So, Bhau, what is the plan?

765
01:13:58,208 --> 01:14:02,750
The greatest armies in the north belong to

766
01:14:02,833 --> 01:14:06,458
Madho Singh, Bijay Singh,
with an army of 5,000 each.

767
01:14:07,125 --> 01:14:09,250
King Suraj Mal, 10,000.

768
01:14:10,833 --> 01:14:12,833
Araadhak Singh, 5,000.

769
01:14:13,667 --> 01:14:14,708
and across the Ganga

770
01:14:14,792 --> 01:14:17,500
Nawab Shuja-ud-Daula,
with an army of 20,000.

771
01:14:18,125 --> 01:14:22,625
-We'll have to make alliances with them.
-As far as Shuja-ud-Daula is concerned

772
01:14:22,708 --> 01:14:27,500
I will ask General Govind Pant
to immediately go and speak to him.

773
01:14:35,708 --> 01:14:40,125
My Lord, I have an urgent message
from Sadashiv Rao Bhau Peshwa.

774
01:14:40,208 --> 01:14:41,875
I know what that is.

775
01:14:43,042 --> 01:14:47,958
General Govind Pant, I do not want to
get crushed in between two mountains.

776
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:49,875
One more thing.

777
01:14:50,625 --> 01:14:55,125
After defeating Abdali, Sadashiv Bhau
wants to make you the Wazir of Delhi.

778
01:15:01,417 --> 01:15:05,667
But will Sadashiv give me
the assurance in writing?

779
01:15:06,250 --> 01:15:07,833
His Majesty wants your support.

780
01:15:08,375 --> 01:15:11,583
For your satisfaction,
you will get it in writing!

781
01:15:12,458 --> 01:15:14,333
Then you have my allegiance!

782
01:15:17,375 --> 01:15:21,167
Shuja will surely side with us.
But Suraj Mal?

783
01:15:22,667 --> 01:15:24,500
Suraj Mal and you are on good terms.

784
01:15:26,333 --> 01:15:28,375
I thought you'd bring him along with you.

785
01:15:29,542 --> 01:15:32,083
I tried, but he wasn't convinced.

786
01:15:34,417 --> 01:15:38,042
Should we send him a message as well
to come meet us immediately?

787
01:15:38,708 --> 01:15:40,625
No. He's a king.

788
01:15:42,250 --> 01:15:43,583
I will go meet him myself.

789
01:15:49,583 --> 01:15:55,417
Forgive me, every two months
your letters arrive, asking for taxes.

790
01:15:58,250 --> 01:16:02,042
King Suraj Mal, I am ready to forgo
your remaining taxes.

791
01:16:04,042 --> 01:16:07,125
But this is not the time to muster
differences amongst us.

792
01:16:07,958 --> 01:16:10,625
-It is time to join hands.
-That is true.

793
01:16:11,750 --> 01:16:14,042
We believe in unity too.

794
01:16:15,125 --> 01:16:20,125
We have always wanted
good relations with you Peshwas.

795
01:16:20,708 --> 01:16:23,292
That is why we've given your wazir refuge.

796
01:16:24,917 --> 01:16:27,250
Wazir? Imad-ul-Mulk is here?

797
01:16:27,958 --> 01:16:30,208
Yes. Call the wazir.

798
01:16:30,792 --> 01:16:34,125
It's surprising. He's joined you
and he's not informed us about it.

799
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:38,250
Come, Wazir.

800
01:16:41,125 --> 01:16:45,542
Imad-ul-Mulk,
how dare you assassinate the Emperor?

801
01:16:46,125 --> 01:16:49,375
Your Grace, Alamgir was a threat
to the Maratha regime.

802
01:16:49,458 --> 01:16:52,333
Regardless, who are you to kill him?

803
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:56,250
Who gave you the authority?
The Peshwas did not.

804
01:16:56,333 --> 01:16:58,125
I did, but for whom?

805
01:16:58,458 --> 01:16:59,792
-For the Peshwas--
-Nonsense!

806
01:17:00,917 --> 01:17:05,000
At first sight of danger, you fled
from Delhi. Was this also for the Peshwas?

807
01:17:05,958 --> 01:17:08,000
-Arrest him!
-Wait.

808
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,833
Bhau sahib, I have given him refuge.

809
01:17:21,792 --> 01:17:24,667
Bhau sahib, keep in mind
that the political situation

810
01:17:24,750 --> 01:17:27,000
up north is tricky.

811
01:17:27,750 --> 01:17:33,833
When it comes to alliances, I got Najib's
letter to join forces with Abdali.

812
01:17:35,500 --> 01:17:38,958
But now I know what answer to give him.

813
01:17:40,833 --> 01:17:45,292
You have taken up such a great
responsibility, so I am with you.

814
01:17:46,667 --> 01:17:47,750
Long live!

815
01:17:49,083 --> 01:17:52,167
This is why you're great, King!

816
01:17:55,833 --> 01:17:57,292
My army of 10,000

817
01:17:57,875 --> 01:18:01,083
and the necessary resources
are all yours.

818
01:18:04,583 --> 01:18:08,417
<i>And this way,</i>
<i>slowly the Maratha army began to grow.</i>

819
01:18:09,875 --> 01:18:12,875
<i>To assemble an army for battle</i>
<i>is a battle in itself.</i>

820
01:18:14,458 --> 01:18:17,375
<i>Feeding a family of four</i>
<i>is a difficult job.</i>

821
01:18:18,042 --> 01:18:21,792
<i>Now imagine if your family</i>
<i>is 50,000 strong.</i>

822
01:18:22,542 --> 01:18:24,125
<i>But we were prepared.</i>

823
01:18:41,917 --> 01:18:45,417
Our army is ready for you.

824
01:18:46,875 --> 01:18:50,542
<i>On hearing King Araadhak Singh's</i>
<i>message, everyone was delighted.</i>

825
01:18:51,625 --> 01:18:56,667
<i>My Lord's plan was working.</i>
<i>It felt as if everyone was with us.</i>

826
01:18:57,500 --> 01:19:01,500
<i>Now we awaited King Madho Singh</i>
<i>and King Bijay Singh.</i>

827
01:19:17,458 --> 01:19:20,583
We hope you like our elephants.

828
01:19:21,708 --> 01:19:24,875
They are from our Royal stables,
a small gift for you.

829
01:19:25,875 --> 01:19:26,833
Incredible, Madho Singh.

830
01:19:28,208 --> 01:19:31,333
But they're of no use to me or my army!

831
01:19:31,875 --> 01:19:33,125
But anyway, <i>tashaakor</i>!

832
01:19:33,708 --> 01:19:34,542
Thank you.

833
01:19:35,333 --> 01:19:36,292
Thank you!

834
01:19:37,708 --> 01:19:38,542
Tell me.

835
01:19:39,542 --> 01:19:42,417
After defeating us
the Marathas bully us with taxes.

836
01:19:42,500 --> 01:19:44,292
Not for much longer.

837
01:19:45,875 --> 01:19:49,833
After capturing Delhi,
our next conquest is Pune.

838
01:19:50,833 --> 01:19:55,542
To teach the Marathas a lesson,
consider our army and resources your own.

839
01:19:56,750 --> 01:20:00,833
Once they are defeated,
we can serve you better.

840
01:20:00,917 --> 01:20:02,208
Do not worry!

841
01:20:03,500 --> 01:20:05,208
We will wipe the Marathas out.

842
01:20:08,250 --> 01:20:11,833
-We shall take your leave then.
-We will await your order.

843
01:20:23,958 --> 01:20:25,250
Excellent, Najib.

844
01:20:27,292 --> 01:20:30,667
Now try to get as many kings as you can
to ally with us.

845
01:20:31,958 --> 01:20:34,792
These Hindostanis are great enemies
of one another.

846
01:20:35,833 --> 01:20:37,333
They fight amongst themselves.

847
01:20:38,625 --> 01:20:41,542
Take advantage of their animosity.

848
01:20:42,667 --> 01:20:43,917
I will try, Your Majesty.

849
01:20:46,792 --> 01:20:48,083
Now, who is the next king?

850
01:20:49,750 --> 01:20:51,125
Nawab Shuja-ud-Daula.

851
01:21:02,542 --> 01:21:05,750
Chandrapur's King says that if
he faces a shortage of resources--

852
01:21:05,833 --> 01:21:10,042
Our spies have told us that Abdali
is currently in Rohillabad.

853
01:21:11,917 --> 01:21:14,750
Doab, on the banks of the Yamuna.

854
01:21:15,833 --> 01:21:18,667
Now instead of Delhi,
we should go to Rohillabad.

855
01:21:18,750 --> 01:21:19,917
Shamsher.

856
01:21:20,500 --> 01:21:23,042
We are here and Abdali's there.

857
01:21:23,708 --> 01:21:27,958
The Yamuna is in between us,
approximately 200 kilometers away.

858
01:21:29,500 --> 01:21:31,042
I'll inform General Govind Pant

859
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,083
to begin creating a bridge
across the Yamuna.

860
01:21:36,208 --> 01:21:38,375
Bhau sahib, can I tell you something?

861
01:21:38,958 --> 01:21:42,708
If we are going to fight in the Doab,
Shuja's allegiance is very important.

862
01:21:43,292 --> 01:21:47,417
Absolutely.
Govind Pant has already convinced him.

863
01:21:49,708 --> 01:21:51,250
Najib-ud-Daula...

864
01:21:52,417 --> 01:21:55,708
I've heard your Afghani
superior has arrived.

865
01:21:56,750 --> 01:22:00,042
Nawab sahib,
he himself has sent me to meet you.

866
01:22:01,125 --> 01:22:05,125
We have come to ask for your
support to fight the Marathas.

867
01:22:05,417 --> 01:22:08,542
-But I have--
-Hear me out.

868
01:22:08,667 --> 01:22:13,375
Once the Marathas are defeated,
he will make you the Wazir of Hindostan.

869
01:22:15,667 --> 01:22:17,042
What's so great about this?

870
01:22:17,917 --> 01:22:20,917
The Marathas have
already promised me that.

871
01:22:21,500 --> 01:22:24,125
How are you so sure
that Sadashiv will honor his word?

872
01:22:25,708 --> 01:22:27,667
Abdali sends a written commitment.
Look.

873
01:22:30,500 --> 01:22:31,417
Look for yourself.

874
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:45,417
-Why should I trust him?
-Trust me.

875
01:22:45,958 --> 01:22:49,208
He is here at my invitation.

876
01:22:50,250 --> 01:22:53,083
And why should I trust you?

877
01:22:54,292 --> 01:22:57,375
We have too many differences!

878
01:22:57,667 --> 01:23:00,583
I want to bury the past, Nawab sahib.

879
01:23:01,958 --> 01:23:03,583
Look, one thing is clear.

880
01:23:04,750 --> 01:23:10,542
The side you are going to choose will
have an enormous advantage in this battle.

881
01:23:12,208 --> 01:23:17,833
Just imagine,
you will be the wazir of Delhi...

882
01:23:18,458 --> 01:23:19,875
And you the Emperor!

883
01:23:20,875 --> 01:23:25,292
No, no. I will be a General
serving under you.

884
01:23:26,458 --> 01:23:29,042
We can install a puppet Emperor

885
01:23:29,750 --> 01:23:33,667
and exercise complete power.

886
01:23:41,625 --> 01:23:42,625
Nawab sahib.

887
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:49,250
How can one Muslim brother ignore
the pleas of another Muslim brother?

888
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,417
-Greetings, General Govind Pant.
-Welcome!

889
01:24:07,792 --> 01:24:09,333
Greetings, General Govind Pant.

890
01:24:09,708 --> 01:24:12,833
-It's a pleasure to see you again.
-Mine too, Your Majesty.

891
01:24:13,417 --> 01:24:14,292
Please come.

892
01:24:18,833 --> 01:24:21,042
General Govind Pant, what happened here?

893
01:24:21,833 --> 01:24:25,750
The heavy rains did not allow us to make
the bridge. What we made was destroyed.

894
01:24:25,833 --> 01:24:28,500
Our boats were washed away.
I tried my best, My Lord.

895
01:24:29,292 --> 01:24:31,083
No one has ever won against nature.

896
01:24:45,708 --> 01:24:50,667
We cannot start making the bridge
until the water recedes.

897
01:24:59,958 --> 01:25:01,708
There's some activity on that bank.

898
01:25:19,458 --> 01:25:23,917
That is Abdali's army.
Najib-ud-Daula's army is with him too.

899
01:25:34,583 --> 01:25:36,375
Whose are those other flags?

900
01:25:45,042 --> 01:25:46,042
Forgive me.

901
01:25:47,542 --> 01:25:48,500
There is bad news.

902
01:25:50,667 --> 01:25:53,875
Those other flags are of Shuja-ud-Daula.

903
01:25:57,250 --> 01:26:01,500
After agreeing to me, it seems
he has switched loyalties.

904
01:26:06,333 --> 01:26:09,167
Shuja-ud-Daula has betrayed us.

905
01:26:15,667 --> 01:26:17,375
We have King Suraj Mal with us.

906
01:27:34,917 --> 01:27:38,792
<i>The Afghan army and us</i>
<i>were at a standstill</i>

907
01:27:38,875 --> 01:27:41,875
<i>across the river, for over a month.</i>

908
01:27:43,667 --> 01:27:48,250
<i>The expedition which had been pleasant</i>
<i>until now began to reveal its darker face.</i>

909
01:27:48,792 --> 01:27:51,542
My Lord, the bridge cannot be made.

910
01:27:52,375 --> 01:27:56,125
It hasn't stopped raining.
So how will the water recede?

911
01:27:58,667 --> 01:28:00,958
Our food and resources are also depleting.

912
01:28:02,375 --> 01:28:03,500
For how long will we wait?

913
01:28:04,500 --> 01:28:08,208
Your Majesty, may I make a suggestion?

914
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:10,875
Yes. Go ahead.

915
01:28:12,125 --> 01:28:14,542
I think we should go back.

916
01:28:15,625 --> 01:28:18,875
We can come back again next year
before the monsoons.

917
01:28:18,958 --> 01:28:21,958
And let Abdali kill and plunder
innocent people?

918
01:28:23,375 --> 01:28:24,375
Yes, General?

919
01:28:26,208 --> 01:28:27,125
No.

920
01:28:28,125 --> 01:28:29,833
We cannot pull back.

921
01:28:31,167 --> 01:28:32,917
Then, what should we do?

922
01:28:42,708 --> 01:28:43,625
What if...

923
01:28:47,792 --> 01:28:50,917
If we can't cross the river,
then neither can he.

924
01:28:51,417 --> 01:28:52,500
Yes, so?

925
01:28:53,708 --> 01:28:55,375
Instead, we'll move forward.

926
01:28:56,375 --> 01:28:59,542
-I don't understand.
-What was our plan?

927
01:29:02,292 --> 01:29:05,833
We would defeat Abdali and Najib
in Rohillabad and then move on to Delhi.

928
01:29:06,833 --> 01:29:10,750
Since we can't cross the Yamuna,
we only have one option left.

929
01:29:12,750 --> 01:29:17,417
We will march along the riverbank
towards Delhi

930
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:19,167
and capture Delhi!

931
01:29:20,208 --> 01:29:22,292
Once we establish rule over Delhi then--

932
01:29:22,375 --> 01:29:25,333
-Then we will cross the Yamuna.
-And attack Abdali.

933
01:29:27,375 --> 01:29:30,917
-This is a good plan, Your Majesty.
-It's good, it's really good.

934
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:34,625
But Uncle, without food and resources,
how will we reach Delhi?

935
01:29:37,208 --> 01:29:38,958
King Suraj Mal, General Malhar Rao...

936
01:29:39,542 --> 01:29:41,833
is there anyone else
we can approach for help?

937
01:29:42,583 --> 01:29:44,833
We have left no stone unturned.

938
01:29:45,583 --> 01:29:48,375
We've approached all the kings
in this province already.

939
01:29:48,750 --> 01:29:52,083
There is one possibility.
Sakina Begum.

940
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:56,417
After the death of her husband,
she has taken over the reins.

941
01:29:57,250 --> 01:30:03,083
But she doesn't trust anyone
and keeps away from all alliances.

942
01:30:03,667 --> 01:30:04,875
He's right.

943
01:30:05,458 --> 01:30:06,833
I can go if you wish.

944
01:30:10,750 --> 01:30:13,833
But My Lady, she does not meet anybody!

945
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:18,875
She might agree to meet a woman.
Maybe!

946
01:30:31,042 --> 01:30:32,000
You should go!

947
01:30:37,917 --> 01:30:43,250
<i>Humility and righteousness are keys</i>
<i>that can open any lock.</i>

948
01:30:44,208 --> 01:30:49,417
<i>After sending several requests,</i>
<i>Sakina Begum agreed to meet me.</i>

949
01:30:50,208 --> 01:30:54,667
Luster of our eyes,
Protector of the people

950
01:30:55,250 --> 01:31:00,333
Beauty of the region, Sakina Begum
is blessing us with her presence.

951
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:08,875
His majesty Sadashiv Rao Bhau Peshwa's
wife, <i>Peshween</i> Parvati Bai.

952
01:31:09,625 --> 01:31:11,000
Please, have a seat.

953
01:31:16,125 --> 01:31:20,458
-I thank you for giving me an audience.
-What do you want from me?

954
01:31:21,667 --> 01:31:25,750
Just some resources
for my army for a few days.

955
01:31:26,750 --> 01:31:27,875
So we can go to Delhi.

956
01:31:29,292 --> 01:31:32,792
I've come to you hoping you will help me.

957
01:31:34,250 --> 01:31:40,167
Once I let your army in, it won't be long
before they usurp my throne.

958
01:31:40,667 --> 01:31:42,417
Begum, consider this.

959
01:31:42,958 --> 01:31:46,583
If the Peshwa wanted to usurp your throne,
he would have sent his army.

960
01:31:47,542 --> 01:31:49,083
Not his queen.

961
01:31:51,083 --> 01:31:53,208
I've come here
to extend a hand of friendship.

962
01:31:54,417 --> 01:31:57,917
Parvati Bai, I am wary of friends.

963
01:31:58,958 --> 01:32:00,292
Why are you going to Delhi?

964
01:32:01,250 --> 01:32:05,417
-To stop Ahmad Shah Abdali.
-Then it's even more difficult!

965
01:32:06,083 --> 01:32:10,583
If I agreed to help you,
Abdali will destroy my kingdom too.

966
01:32:13,167 --> 01:32:16,292
I lost my husband in a similar conflict.

967
01:32:18,250 --> 01:32:21,292
Warfare is born from the male ego.

968
01:32:23,083 --> 01:32:28,417
They themselves get killed and leave
behind weeping widows and crying orphans.

969
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:31,292
I can understand, My Lady.

970
01:32:33,792 --> 01:32:36,042
Yet, this did not stop me.

971
01:32:38,417 --> 01:32:42,250
I have travelled far with my husband.

972
01:32:43,667 --> 01:32:46,167
Because I believe
in his honest intentions.

973
01:32:47,250 --> 01:32:48,875
He's fighting for this country.

974
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:56,917
Your late husband died fighting
for this country too, did he not?

975
01:32:58,792 --> 01:32:59,708
Sacrifice?

976
01:33:04,583 --> 01:33:06,792
Yes, he sacrificed everything.

977
01:33:07,917 --> 01:33:11,083
And now, you are governing
the kingdom, just like him.

978
01:33:12,417 --> 01:33:14,625
-Yes!
-My Lady...

979
01:33:16,792 --> 01:33:21,833
I know that just like me,
you are not from a royal household.

980
01:33:23,167 --> 01:33:25,042
Neither are you the daughter of a Nawab.

981
01:33:25,792 --> 01:33:30,000
We both understand
the pain of the common man. Don't we?

982
01:33:33,958 --> 01:33:36,167
War affects them the most.

983
01:33:39,458 --> 01:33:42,000
To protect them,
it is crucial for us to unite.

984
01:33:45,667 --> 01:33:48,625
My late husband had the same beliefs.

985
01:33:50,417 --> 01:33:52,833
And that is the very reason
he lost his life.

986
01:33:53,792 --> 01:33:57,000
If he were alive today
and I was to meet him,

987
01:33:57,458 --> 01:33:59,583
would he too have refused?

988
01:34:01,875 --> 01:34:04,458
Just tell me what he would
have said and I'll leave.

989
01:34:10,375 --> 01:34:11,500
He would have said...

990
01:34:14,500 --> 01:34:16,625
"It is commendable, Parvati Bai.

991
01:34:17,958 --> 01:34:22,667
You have travelled so far
just to stop Abdali.

992
01:34:25,250 --> 01:34:30,708
How can my conscience allow me
to stay silent any longer?"

993
01:34:35,083 --> 01:34:37,042
He would have said something like this.

994
01:35:12,875 --> 01:35:16,500
Three thousand sacks of corn and rice
and five thousand soldiers.

995
01:35:18,500 --> 01:35:21,125
I convinced Queen Sakina
to ally completely!

996
01:35:25,917 --> 01:35:27,583
You're truly amazing, Parvati!

997
01:35:31,250 --> 01:35:32,875
Let's not waste a single moment.

998
01:35:35,417 --> 01:35:36,750
-General Govind Pant.
-Yes?

999
01:35:38,500 --> 01:35:41,000
Your army of 10,000 is held up
across the Yamuna, right?

1000
01:35:41,083 --> 01:35:41,917
Yes.

1001
01:35:42,375 --> 01:35:46,625
Once the water recedes,
return to them and await my message.

1002
01:35:47,250 --> 01:35:50,583
I will send a message
as soon as I need you.

1003
01:35:50,667 --> 01:35:53,125
-Yes, My Lord!
-Now get ready.

1004
01:35:54,500 --> 01:35:57,833
Let's capture Delhi
from under Abdali's nose.

1005
01:36:26,708 --> 01:36:27,667
Your Majesty.

1006
01:36:31,625 --> 01:36:32,542
I have good news!

1007
01:36:33,208 --> 01:36:35,375
The Marathas retreated
from the Yamuna bank.

1008
01:36:35,750 --> 01:36:39,000
There is no trace of their tents.
They ran away!

1009
01:36:46,500 --> 01:36:49,417
-The Marathas fled!
-What else could they have done?

1010
01:36:50,167 --> 01:36:52,250
They couldn't have crossed the Yamuna.

1011
01:36:52,625 --> 01:36:55,917
Yamuna saved them, or else
the infidels would have been destroyed.

1012
01:36:58,292 --> 01:37:01,917
I don't think they will retreat so easily.

1013
01:37:04,583 --> 01:37:08,833
Najib, find out exactly
where they have disappeared.

1014
01:37:09,958 --> 01:37:11,583
And what are their plans.

1015
01:37:21,708 --> 01:37:23,167
How much time will it take us?

1016
01:37:23,458 --> 01:37:26,417
Ten days to reach Delhi
and another four days to capture it.

1017
01:37:26,792 --> 01:37:29,083
Do not forget that Najib's army
is in Delhi now.

1018
01:37:29,167 --> 01:37:31,792
I'll give you Delhi in a day, not four.

1019
01:37:32,292 --> 01:37:33,917
I have seen the fortification there!

1020
01:37:37,083 --> 01:37:42,958
-Are you absolutely sure?
-Sir, I only speak when I am certain.

1021
01:37:44,875 --> 01:37:46,667
-Bhau sahib?
-Yes?

1022
01:37:48,667 --> 01:37:50,792
-Can I say something?
-Yes.

1023
01:37:51,583 --> 01:37:53,667
Do not trust Ibrahim Khan.

1024
01:37:55,042 --> 01:37:55,958
Why?

1025
01:37:56,375 --> 01:37:59,583
Because he can switch sides
at any moment, out of greed.

1026
01:37:59,833 --> 01:38:01,250
After all, he's a Gardi!

1027
01:38:01,708 --> 01:38:06,833
General Malhar Rao, don't worry about him.
I trust him entirely.

1028
01:38:31,042 --> 01:38:31,917
Your Majesty,

1029
01:38:32,500 --> 01:38:35,833
after searching all day,
our riders have returned.

1030
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:40,958
Your Majesty.
They have gone north of the river.

1031
01:38:41,042 --> 01:38:44,042
-Are you sure?
-Yes, Your Majesty. No doubt about it!

1032
01:38:52,625 --> 01:38:55,042
So now they want to take Delhi.

1033
01:38:56,167 --> 01:39:00,250
Sadashiv turned out to be
smarter than I thought.

1034
01:39:02,625 --> 01:39:04,583
So then... what should we do now?

1035
01:39:06,917 --> 01:39:09,708
What does a hunter do to acquire his prey?

1036
01:39:11,917 --> 01:39:13,625
He waits for it?

1037
01:39:15,292 --> 01:39:18,000
A hunter chases his prey!

1038
01:39:18,083 --> 01:39:22,750
-Shah Wali, prepare the army!
-As you command, Your Majesty!

1039
01:39:22,833 --> 01:39:24,875
But how will we cross the river?

1040
01:39:25,500 --> 01:39:26,958
We won't cross the river!

1041
01:39:30,083 --> 01:39:32,500
This is Delhi and we are here.

1042
01:39:33,542 --> 01:39:38,292
We will leave for Delhi
from this side of the Yamuna!

1043
01:39:39,583 --> 01:39:41,333
We will track them like a shadow.

1044
01:39:43,042 --> 01:39:46,000
And once we reach Delhi,
we will cross the Yamuna!

1045
01:39:49,708 --> 01:39:51,333
<i>A grand chase had begun.</i>

1046
01:39:51,833 --> 01:39:55,333
<i>We were speeding upwards</i>
<i>along the southern bank of the Yamuna.</i>

1047
01:39:55,583 --> 01:40:00,458
<i>Unknown to us, the Afghans</i>
<i>gave chase from the northern side.</i>

1048
01:40:01,542 --> 01:40:04,958
<i>We were a day ahead of them</i>
<i>when we made it to the Red Fort of Delhi.</i>

1049
01:40:09,583 --> 01:40:10,417
Look carefully!

1050
01:40:18,167 --> 01:40:22,333
-You call two horse riders an army, Qasim?
-There is fog. Let it clear.

1051
01:40:27,500 --> 01:40:28,458
Did you see that?

1052
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:39,458
Where have they come from?

1053
01:40:56,917 --> 01:40:58,583
Your Majesty, come quickly.

1054
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:07,417
Artillerymen!
Tilt the cannons, two inches up!

1055
01:41:19,333 --> 01:41:21,000
-Load the cannons!
-Yes, sir!

1056
01:41:27,708 --> 01:41:29,375
Fire!

1057
01:41:55,417 --> 01:41:59,375
All 20 cannons on this side,
two inches to the left.

1058
01:42:02,458 --> 01:42:04,375
The fort gate should be destroyed!

1059
01:42:08,792 --> 01:42:10,417
They've destroyed our bastions.

1060
01:42:12,667 --> 01:42:14,083
Fire!

1061
01:42:48,208 --> 01:42:49,375
Is cavalry ready?

1062
01:42:50,458 --> 01:42:52,333
-Ready!
-Ready!

1063
01:42:54,250 --> 01:42:56,292
Attack!

1064
01:42:59,375 --> 01:43:02,750
<i>For the first time in centuries,</i>
<i>Delhi had changed hands.</i>

1065
01:43:02,875 --> 01:43:08,333
<i>However devastated and devoid of any</i>
<i>treasure, it now belonged to the Marathas.</i>

1066
01:43:09,167 --> 01:43:14,208
<i>The sultanate that repeatedly insulted</i>
<i>our Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj,</i>

1067
01:43:14,792 --> 01:43:18,708
<i>on that very Red Fort,</i>
<i>our flag was going to be hoisted.</i>

1068
01:43:24,333 --> 01:43:27,083
This is a big lesson for Abdali.

1069
01:43:28,125 --> 01:43:32,417
Tell Bhau Sadashiv, all of us Sikhs
are with the Marathas.

1070
01:43:32,500 --> 01:43:36,458
But Your Highness, Abdali is already
upset with us since his last invasion.

1071
01:43:37,250 --> 01:43:38,750
Don't worry about it.

1072
01:43:39,583 --> 01:43:42,042
The Marathas had helped us then.

1073
01:43:42,583 --> 01:43:46,958
Now it's our duty to repay them.

1074
01:43:48,792 --> 01:43:55,292
To throw Abdali out of Hindostan,
we'll help the Marathas at any cost!

1075
01:44:19,500 --> 01:44:25,083
<i>Luck has smiled on us</i>
<i>Our enemies flee</i>

1076
01:44:25,167 --> 01:44:26,125
<i>Glory to us!</i>

1077
01:44:31,500 --> 01:44:36,917
<i>We're soldiers</i>
<i>Who always, is a form of Shiva</i>

1078
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:38,375
<i>Glory to us!</i>

1079
01:44:43,292 --> 01:44:49,542
<i>Darkness has finally cleared</i>
<i>Reduced and scattered</i>

1080
01:44:49,625 --> 01:44:54,958
<i>Enemies that challenged us</i>
<i>Have taken a step back</i>

1081
01:44:55,542 --> 01:45:00,958
<i>The earth, the skies</i>
<i>And the winds sing praises</i>

1082
01:45:01,042 --> 01:45:03,958
<i>Shiva in your heart</i>
<i>Shiva in my heart</i>

1083
01:45:04,083 --> 01:45:06,708
<i>Shiva in my breath</i>
<i>Shiva in my soul</i>

1084
01:45:06,958 --> 01:45:09,917
<i>Shiva in every moment</i>
<i>Shiva in every direction</i>

1085
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:13,042
<i>The cry, the echoes</i>
<i>Is All hail Shiva!</i>

1086
01:45:13,125 --> 01:45:15,917
<i>Shiva in your heart</i>
<i>Shiva in my heart</i>

1087
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,542
<i>Shiva in my breath</i>
<i>Shiva in my soul</i>

1088
01:45:18,625 --> 01:45:21,667
<i>Shiva in every moment</i>
<i>Shiva in every direction</i>

1089
01:45:21,750 --> 01:45:25,042
<i>The cry, the echoes</i>
<i>Is All hail Shiva!</i>

1090
01:45:25,125 --> 01:45:28,167
<i>Shiva in your heart</i>

1091
01:45:28,250 --> 01:45:31,125
<i>Hail Mahadev!</i>

1092
01:45:55,875 --> 01:45:58,792
<i>Son of the soil, a true Maratha</i>

1093
01:45:58,917 --> 01:46:01,750
<i>Great ruler of the Sahyadri</i>

1094
01:46:01,875 --> 01:46:07,375
<i>Remembering the great</i>
<i>Shivaji Maharaj today</i>

1095
01:46:07,833 --> 01:46:10,708
<i>Glory to you, O Shiv Raya</i>

1096
01:46:10,833 --> 01:46:13,708
<i>Bless us with your grace</i>

1097
01:46:13,917 --> 01:46:18,292
<i>Remembering the great</i>
<i>Shivaji Maharaj today</i>

1098
01:46:18,792 --> 01:46:25,375
<i>All the walls, and the swords</i>
<i>Of the enemies have been shattered</i>

1099
01:46:25,500 --> 01:46:28,125
<i>The winds that blocked our path</i>

1100
01:46:28,208 --> 01:46:30,667
<i>We turned them in</i>
<i>The same direction it came from</i>

1101
01:46:30,750 --> 01:46:33,833
<i>We knew we would go across</i>
<i>We knew we would do it</i>

1102
01:46:33,958 --> 01:46:36,833
<i>This was bound to happen</i>
<i>Hear us, brother</i>

1103
01:46:37,500 --> 01:46:40,583
<i>They had to leave</i>
<i>And we had to come far</i>

1104
01:46:40,708 --> 01:46:43,000
<i>This was bound to happen, brother</i>

1105
01:46:43,083 --> 01:46:49,208
<i>Now the country belongs to us</i>
<i>We rule here</i>

1106
01:46:49,708 --> 01:46:54,875
<i>The throne belongs to us</i>
<i>And so does the crown</i>

1107
01:46:55,458 --> 01:47:00,958
<i>The courage that burns in your heart</i>
<i>Can melt any metal, now we believe</i>

1108
01:47:01,042 --> 01:47:03,750
<i>Shiva in your heart</i>
<i>Shiva in my heart</i>

1109
01:47:03,833 --> 01:47:07,167
<i>Shiva in my breath</i>
<i>Shiva in every heartbeat</i>

1110
01:47:07,250 --> 01:47:09,917
<i>Shiva in every moment</i>
<i>Shiva in every direction</i>

1111
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:13,000
<i>The cry</i>
<i>The echoes are All hail Shiva</i>

1112
01:47:13,125 --> 01:47:15,833
<i>Shiva in your heart</i>
<i>Shiva in my heart</i>

1113
01:47:15,917 --> 01:47:18,750
<i>Shiva in my breath</i>
<i>Shiva in every heartbeat</i>

1114
01:47:18,833 --> 01:47:21,833
<i>Shiva in every moment</i>
<i>Shiva in every direction</i>

1115
01:47:21,917 --> 01:47:25,000
<i>The cry</i>
<i>The echoes are All hail Shiva</i>

1116
01:47:25,125 --> 01:47:28,125
<i>Shiva in your heart</i>

1117
01:47:43,417 --> 01:47:46,375
<i>Hail Mahadev</i>

1118
01:47:58,875 --> 01:48:03,042
<i>Once the celebrations ended everyone</i>
<i>had the same question in their mind.</i>

1119
01:48:03,875 --> 01:48:06,083
<i>Who will be the new Emperor of Hindostan?</i>

1120
01:48:07,250 --> 01:48:10,417
<i>My Lord, Sadashiv Bhau,</i>
<i>was everyone's favorite, including mine.</i>

1121
01:49:07,250 --> 01:49:09,000
The Queen of Hindostan!

1122
01:49:10,042 --> 01:49:11,083
What are you doing?

1123
01:49:15,667 --> 01:49:18,333
How do I look?
The Queen of Hindostan's crown.

1124
01:49:19,542 --> 01:49:20,417
Lovely.

1125
01:49:22,250 --> 01:49:25,083
-You look lovely.
-Is everything all right?

1126
01:49:31,750 --> 01:49:34,750
What happened, Emperor of Hindostan?

1127
01:49:36,583 --> 01:49:38,083
Parvati, don't call me that.

1128
01:49:38,750 --> 01:49:42,083
Why? Will you not sit on the throne?

1129
01:49:43,500 --> 01:49:44,375
No.

1130
01:49:47,083 --> 01:49:50,625
You don't crown yourself.
Others must crown you.

1131
01:49:55,917 --> 01:49:59,583
I am made for war, not politics.

1132
01:50:01,208 --> 01:50:03,125
But is not politics also war?

1133
01:50:08,250 --> 01:50:12,208
In politics, daggers strike you
in the back. Not in war.

1134
01:50:16,917 --> 01:50:20,333
-So, who will sit on the throne now?
-Vishwas!

1135
01:50:21,583 --> 01:50:24,042
He is the commander of the army.

1136
01:50:24,875 --> 01:50:27,958
Great, at least a Peshwa
will sit on the Mughal throne.

1137
01:50:31,292 --> 01:50:32,167
Do you know?

1138
01:50:33,917 --> 01:50:36,875
This is the first time
the Mughal Dynasty will be broken.

1139
01:50:46,792 --> 01:50:48,750
None of us will sit on the throne.

1140
01:50:52,208 --> 01:50:53,083
What do you mean?

1141
01:50:54,500 --> 01:50:56,833
We will keep it under Maratha control.

1142
01:50:58,625 --> 01:51:02,542
But we will not appoint one of us
as Emperor.

1143
01:51:03,708 --> 01:51:04,667
We are the protectors.

1144
01:51:06,208 --> 01:51:07,750
We should have control.

1145
01:51:09,083 --> 01:51:12,208
And we will rule,
but we will not sit on the throne.

1146
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:15,792
But Your Majesty, we can't
keep the throne empty either.

1147
01:51:15,875 --> 01:51:18,792
We will appoint Shah Jahan III
as Emperor.

1148
01:51:19,125 --> 01:51:23,000
My Lord! Come quickly. Looks like the
Afghan army is reaching the Yamuna bank.

1149
01:51:45,750 --> 01:51:48,042
How did they capture Delhi so quick!

1150
01:51:51,750 --> 01:51:57,333
Which is Abdali's nearest fort
on this side of the Yamuna?

1151
01:51:58,458 --> 01:52:03,167
Kunjpura, North of Delhi.
It is one of Abdali's main forts.

1152
01:52:04,250 --> 01:52:06,000
-Najib.
-Yes!

1153
01:52:07,292 --> 01:52:11,125
-You were not able to save it.
-I am shocked myself, Emperor!

1154
01:52:12,083 --> 01:52:16,750
-I had put my best General here.
-Your best was not good enough, Najib!

1155
01:52:20,583 --> 01:52:22,208
I should have come here earlier.

1156
01:52:23,917 --> 01:52:26,708
Sadashiv is proving to be dangerous!

1157
01:52:27,875 --> 01:52:29,167
Prepare for battle.

1158
01:52:30,208 --> 01:52:34,875
Before Abdali crosses the Yamuna,
we have to capture Kunjpura.

1159
01:52:39,917 --> 01:52:44,750
<i>We took Kunjpura Fort just as easily</i>
<i>as we did the Red Fort.</i>

1160
01:52:45,250 --> 01:52:48,292
<i>It seemed like all our problems</i>
<i>had disappeared.</i>

1161
01:52:49,250 --> 01:52:53,125
<i>But we knew we had poked the beast.</i>

1162
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:57,375
Najib!

1163
01:53:00,167 --> 01:53:02,375
I am losing one battle after another.

1164
01:53:03,625 --> 01:53:06,833
First Delhi!
And now Kunjpura!

1165
01:53:08,083 --> 01:53:09,917
All because of your incorrect advice.

1166
01:53:10,542 --> 01:53:14,833
-Emperor, I'll advise--
-I don't want your advice!

1167
01:53:15,417 --> 01:53:18,958
Forgive me... Forgive me, Your Majesty.

1168
01:53:27,125 --> 01:53:30,875
I'm stuck here and Sadashiv
is digging into my territory.

1169
01:53:37,208 --> 01:53:42,042
Next he will march towards Punjab
and ally with the Sikhs.

1170
01:53:46,125 --> 01:53:47,042
What should I do?

1171
01:53:49,292 --> 01:53:52,500
What should I do? We must stop him!

1172
01:53:56,708 --> 01:53:58,250
I want to cross the Yamuna!

1173
01:53:58,708 --> 01:54:00,708
That's not advisable right now, Emperor!

1174
01:54:09,417 --> 01:54:12,500
I don't want your advice.

1175
01:54:17,750 --> 01:54:19,500
I want to cross the Yamuna.

1176
01:54:21,500 --> 01:54:23,542
Right now! This instant!

1177
01:54:32,208 --> 01:54:34,333
I want to cross the Yamuna!

1178
01:55:19,833 --> 01:55:21,375
Abdali has crossed the river.

1179
01:55:22,833 --> 01:55:25,833
He is coming after us.
Just a 100 kilometers away.

1180
01:55:28,708 --> 01:55:30,583
Then we won't make it to the Sikhs.

1181
01:55:31,625 --> 01:55:34,417
What if we double our pace
and march at night too?

1182
01:55:35,292 --> 01:55:37,500
It was possible if we were just an army.

1183
01:55:37,833 --> 01:55:41,375
But with all the women, civilians
and pilgrims, it is impossible.

1184
01:55:45,333 --> 01:55:49,042
The fort of Panipat is nearby.
We can go there.

1185
01:55:53,542 --> 01:55:55,667
This is the moment we've been waiting for.

1186
01:55:56,750 --> 01:56:00,583
Draw your swords.
We will fight Abdali there.

1187
01:56:01,792 --> 01:56:02,750
In Panipat!

1188
01:56:06,625 --> 01:56:10,292
<i>On hearing the word "Panipat,"</i>
<i>I was struck with fear.</i>

1189
01:56:11,542 --> 01:56:14,917
<i>It felt as if a battle was inevitable.</i>

1190
01:56:20,542 --> 01:56:21,917
Panipat Fort!

1191
01:56:28,208 --> 01:56:31,958
This fort is too small.
It will not be able to accommodate us all.

1192
01:56:33,083 --> 01:56:35,125
We should set up a camp close by.

1193
01:56:36,208 --> 01:56:37,042
Let's go.

1194
01:56:51,083 --> 01:56:54,875
Mehendale, we must quickly dig trenches.

1195
01:56:56,958 --> 01:56:57,833
Yes.

1196
01:56:58,708 --> 01:56:59,625
Okay.

1197
01:57:09,875 --> 01:57:12,125
<i>And so, the waiting game began.</i>

1198
01:57:13,250 --> 01:57:16,208
<i>But we were already facing hardships.</i>

1199
01:57:17,208 --> 01:57:19,167
<i>Our food and resources were almost over.</i>

1200
01:57:19,583 --> 01:57:24,125
My Lord, it has been three days.
The soldiers have not eaten anything.

1201
01:57:24,792 --> 01:57:26,458
Nothing remains besides jaggery.

1202
01:57:27,458 --> 01:57:31,500
<i>And our allies, the Sikhs, were unable</i>
<i>to send resources, or their army.</i>

1203
01:57:31,583 --> 01:57:33,042
I don't know what to do.

1204
01:57:34,667 --> 01:57:36,583
How should we help Sadashiv Bhau?

1205
01:57:41,042 --> 01:57:42,625
What can I say, Bhau sahib?

1206
01:57:43,500 --> 01:57:47,917
We were stuck across the Yamuna,
that's why we got delayed.

1207
01:57:48,458 --> 01:57:50,708
No, King Araadhak Singh,
you have come at the right time.

1208
01:57:51,417 --> 01:57:52,625
We appreciate your help.

1209
01:57:53,292 --> 01:57:56,042
-How many soldiers have you brought?
-Five thousand.

1210
01:57:57,458 --> 01:58:02,000
<i>King Araadhak Singh joining us</i>
<i>was a great relief.</i>

1211
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:06,208
<i>But our joy was short-lived.</i>

1212
01:58:36,083 --> 01:58:42,292
Now there is no river between us,
Sadashiv Rao Bhau Peshwa!

1213
01:58:44,125 --> 01:58:45,042
Abdali...

1214
01:58:46,833 --> 01:58:49,750
Now only the battlefield of Panipat
lies between us.

1215
01:58:52,958 --> 01:58:56,750
<i>After months of hiding and seek,</i>
<i>and redrawing routes on maps</i>

1216
01:58:56,875 --> 01:59:00,875
<i>the Marathas and the Afghans finally came</i>
<i>face to face on the ground of Panipat.</i>

1217
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:05,042
<i>What was surprising was that</i>
<i>both blocked each other's paths.</i>

1218
01:59:05,167 --> 01:59:08,375
<i>Behind us was Kandahar,</i>
<i>and behind them was Pune.</i>

1219
01:59:21,167 --> 01:59:24,875
Your Majesty, everything will be
prepared today before sunset.

1220
01:59:27,042 --> 01:59:32,708
Prince Taimur Shah Abdali
is arriving with his army!

1221
01:59:43,333 --> 01:59:45,708
Taimur, you have arrived sooner
than I expected.

1222
01:59:45,792 --> 01:59:48,167
I left Punjab the moment
I received your letter.

1223
01:59:49,292 --> 01:59:52,542
But Father, I bring bad news.

1224
01:59:53,583 --> 01:59:57,250
-What? Tell me quickly.
-News from Kandahar.

1225
01:59:57,833 --> 02:00:00,208
Uncle Sarfaraz has tried
to take over the throne.

1226
02:00:00,792 --> 02:00:03,500
A large revolt is underway.

1227
02:00:16,083 --> 02:00:18,000
Sarfaraz!

1228
02:00:37,250 --> 02:00:38,750
I have to go back.

1229
02:00:40,333 --> 02:00:42,500
I have to go back to Kandahar!

1230
02:00:44,583 --> 02:00:46,417
-Right away.
-Kandahar?

1231
02:00:47,083 --> 02:00:48,792
How can you do this?

1232
02:00:49,417 --> 02:00:54,792
To win Hindostan, I will not put
Afghanistan on the line.

1233
02:00:54,875 --> 02:00:56,167
I understand, Emperor...

1234
02:00:58,167 --> 02:00:59,833
But the question is, how will you go?

1235
02:01:00,708 --> 02:01:03,542
The Marathas have blocked
your path, Emperor.

1236
02:01:04,125 --> 02:01:06,750
Look here, Your Majesty!

1237
02:01:18,333 --> 02:01:23,583
But if I get stuck in this battle,
I will lose Kandahar.

1238
02:01:30,250 --> 02:01:31,083
All right...

1239
02:01:32,792 --> 02:01:34,167
If I cannot go...

1240
02:01:36,208 --> 02:01:38,292
send a message that I want a truce!

1241
02:01:40,875 --> 02:01:45,333
Now... all that we have done here,
just to strike a truce?

1242
02:01:46,417 --> 02:01:47,333
Najib!

1243
02:01:48,500 --> 02:01:52,167
I want a truce with Sadashiv!

1244
02:01:54,125 --> 02:01:55,375
Arrange for it!

1245
02:02:01,042 --> 02:02:02,000
Yes, Your Majesty.

1246
02:02:36,875 --> 02:02:41,625
Emperor of Afghanistan,
Leader of Leaders, Ahmad Shah Abdali!

1247
02:02:41,708 --> 02:02:44,083
His Highness Sadashiv Rao Bhau Peshwa!

1248
02:02:47,292 --> 02:02:49,292
I have been told you want a truce.

1249
02:02:51,542 --> 02:02:55,250
I am with you. Because battles
always desolate an empire.

1250
02:02:56,375 --> 02:02:59,000
You've come a long way to learn this.

1251
02:02:59,542 --> 02:03:02,708
I had to come.
To stop an invader.

1252
02:03:03,667 --> 02:03:08,083
-A thousand kilometers away.
-I have travelled far as well.

1253
02:03:08,167 --> 02:03:11,458
Yes, you have, but to loot!

1254
02:03:13,125 --> 02:03:14,833
We have come to protect.

1255
02:03:14,917 --> 02:03:17,250
I don't want to waste time
arguing with you.

1256
02:03:18,667 --> 02:03:20,042
I do not want a battle.

1257
02:03:20,917 --> 02:03:23,792
If you don't either, then you'll have to
accept my terms.

1258
02:03:25,917 --> 02:03:26,792
What terms?

1259
02:03:27,917 --> 02:03:30,375
I will return to Kandahar if...

1260
02:03:31,375 --> 02:03:35,958
you Marathas remain
south of the Narmada river

1261
02:03:36,792 --> 02:03:38,542
and hand over Delhi to me.

1262
02:03:39,125 --> 02:03:43,042
No. You will stay north of Attock,
where you've come from,

1263
02:03:44,083 --> 02:03:46,458
and you will not step foot
on this land again.

1264
02:03:48,667 --> 02:03:50,625
I'll give you one more alternative.

1265
02:03:53,042 --> 02:03:57,875
Everything north of Delhi is mine,
and everything south, yours.

1266
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:02,375
You will stay north of Attock...

1267
02:04:04,792 --> 02:04:08,000
and will not step foot
on Hindostan's soil ever again.

1268
02:04:11,042 --> 02:04:12,875
I will only accept these terms.

1269
02:04:13,583 --> 02:04:17,667
Everything north
of where I'm standing, is mine!

1270
02:04:18,625 --> 02:04:19,917
And the rest is yours.

1271
02:04:22,583 --> 02:04:23,417
No.

1272
02:04:24,625 --> 02:04:29,792
Talk sense, kid.
Or else my expedition will be a waste.

1273
02:04:29,875 --> 02:04:34,833
My expedition will be a waste
if an invader stays on Hindostani soil.

1274
02:04:35,708 --> 02:04:41,083
And the ground you're standing on
right now is part of the Maratha Empire.

1275
02:04:42,708 --> 02:04:47,583
You're throwing your life away
for a small piece of land.

1276
02:04:48,125 --> 02:04:52,083
I am ready to die for even a single
grain of dust of my motherland!

1277
02:04:55,792 --> 02:04:59,042
All right then.
Let's fight it out right here.

1278
02:04:59,667 --> 02:05:00,708
Let's do it!

1279
02:05:02,625 --> 02:05:04,333
Emperor... Your Majesty...

1280
02:05:04,458 --> 02:05:07,250
This is the truce tent... for peace.

1281
02:05:07,958 --> 02:05:10,375
To fight, we have
the entire battlefield of Panipat!

1282
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:26,417
Now, first Hindostan...

1283
02:05:28,875 --> 02:05:29,917
then Afghanistan!

1284
02:05:30,500 --> 02:05:31,333
You're right.

1285
02:05:32,417 --> 02:05:34,375
Hindostan will always come first.

1286
02:05:52,583 --> 02:05:55,375
The Marathas are getting ready
for battle tomorrow.

1287
02:05:58,333 --> 02:06:01,125
Their army is 150,000 and ours is 75,000.

1288
02:06:01,625 --> 02:06:04,333
If we want to win, we'll have to create
a square formation.

1289
02:06:06,833 --> 02:06:08,083
And move ahead like this.

1290
02:06:08,833 --> 02:06:12,625
Our primary goal is to break
the front wall of the Afghan army.

1291
02:06:12,750 --> 02:06:13,625
Yes!

1292
02:06:14,208 --> 02:06:16,333
Ibrahim will be at the front
with his cannons.

1293
02:06:16,417 --> 02:06:18,292
He will need the Elephant Regiment.

1294
02:06:18,875 --> 02:06:23,750
Behind him, the Riflemen, then
the cavalry and then soldiers behind them.

1295
02:06:24,417 --> 02:06:30,083
We have one goal, to penetrate
the Afghan army and destroy them.

1296
02:06:30,167 --> 02:06:31,125
Yes, My Lord!

1297
02:06:31,208 --> 02:06:35,458
On my left Taimur, Najib, Suleiman

1298
02:06:35,542 --> 02:06:38,958
and Nawab sahib's armies
will be positioned.

1299
02:06:40,708 --> 02:06:45,750
On my left, Shamsher,
Vithal Vinchurkar and Damaji Gaekwad.

1300
02:06:46,250 --> 02:06:49,500
On the right, Shah Wali Khan,
and Wahab Khan.

1301
02:06:49,583 --> 02:06:50,458
Emperor.

1302
02:06:50,542 --> 02:06:55,500
On the right, Jankoji
and General Malhar Rao's armies.

1303
02:06:57,083 --> 02:07:00,042
Like always, I will command
the battle from behind.

1304
02:07:01,042 --> 02:07:03,125
I will keep a regiment with me
at all times.

1305
02:07:03,833 --> 02:07:09,417
Behind them, Nana Purandare,
Yashwant Pawar and Antaji Mankeshwar.

1306
02:07:09,500 --> 02:07:12,292
Araadhak Singh, your army
will always be ready for my command.

1307
02:07:12,375 --> 02:07:13,667
Yes, My Lord.

1308
02:07:13,750 --> 02:07:16,792
And I will be in the middle
with my Huzurat Cavalry.

1309
02:07:18,083 --> 02:07:23,250
All the women, pilgrims and civilians
will stay safe on this hill.

1310
02:07:23,458 --> 02:07:27,333
A small regiment will stay with them
for their protection.

1311
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:30,750
-Ready your armies!
-Yes!

1312
02:07:34,667 --> 02:07:35,500
General Malhar Rao.

1313
02:07:44,125 --> 02:07:45,458
If something goes wrong...

1314
02:07:45,958 --> 02:07:50,792
taking the women to a safer place
will be your responsibility.

1315
02:07:55,375 --> 02:07:58,875
Uncle, you have told everyone
their positions.

1316
02:07:59,458 --> 02:08:00,417
Where will I be?

1317
02:08:06,208 --> 02:08:07,208
I am not going anywhere.

1318
02:08:07,292 --> 02:08:10,167
You're going back, Vishwas.
From the back route.

1319
02:08:10,375 --> 02:08:14,333
-No one will see you.
-No. I will fight alongside you.

1320
02:08:14,417 --> 02:08:17,958
-No. You are my responsibility.
-I am no one's responsibility!

1321
02:08:18,542 --> 02:08:21,667
In Pune, mother protects me
and here, Uncle Shamsher and you.

1322
02:08:23,292 --> 02:08:25,958
When will I get the chance
to protect my motherland?

1323
02:08:26,042 --> 02:08:28,917
We protect you because you are a Peshwa.

1324
02:08:29,708 --> 02:08:30,667
You're right.

1325
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:34,000
But if you keep protecting me,
how will I ever become Peshwa?

1326
02:08:39,292 --> 02:08:42,000
I am the commander of this army.
And I will fight!

1327
02:08:56,500 --> 02:08:57,417
All right.

1328
02:08:59,708 --> 02:09:03,583
You will stay between Shamsher and me,
on an elephant. Near my elephant.

1329
02:09:04,625 --> 02:09:06,125
But I have a condition.

1330
02:09:09,042 --> 02:09:12,792
You will never get off your elephant.

1331
02:09:54,875 --> 02:09:56,083
Forgive me, My Lord.

1332
02:09:58,208 --> 02:10:01,417
But I only have this for you.

1333
02:10:05,750 --> 02:10:07,917
-Sugar water.
-Have you had some?

1334
02:10:28,875 --> 02:10:31,500
Parvati, if something happens to me...

1335
02:10:35,917 --> 02:10:39,542
If something happens to me, promise me...

1336
02:10:40,958 --> 02:10:42,167
you will not commit Sati.

1337
02:10:49,292 --> 02:10:50,125
Parvati...

1338
02:10:54,625 --> 02:10:55,458
Promise me.

1339
02:10:57,458 --> 02:11:00,042
You will not commit Sati.

1340
02:12:05,333 --> 02:12:08,417
Brothers, look all around you!

1341
02:12:09,083 --> 02:12:11,875
This is the face of our Hindostani army!

1342
02:12:13,167 --> 02:12:14,375
There are Hindus...

1343
02:12:16,208 --> 02:12:17,542
Muslims...

1344
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:21,583
people of different castes and farmers!

1345
02:12:22,250 --> 02:12:25,833
All fighting for their country,
standing united as one.

1346
02:12:27,542 --> 02:12:29,375
You're fighting for your motherland,

1347
02:12:30,458 --> 02:12:32,167
for your homes, your families.

1348
02:12:33,583 --> 02:12:37,583
But first of all, you are fighting for
the men that are standing beside you

1349
02:12:38,667 --> 02:12:41,667
who have travelled miles with you
on this expedition

1350
02:12:42,250 --> 02:12:44,083
shoulder to shoulder, to fight!

1351
02:12:44,667 --> 02:12:45,958
And why is that?

1352
02:12:48,208 --> 02:12:50,250
To stop that invader!

1353
02:12:50,333 --> 02:12:53,083
-Yes, Your Majesty!
-Yes, Your Majesty!

1354
02:12:55,792 --> 02:13:00,625
Step onto the battlefield
and face him with all your might.

1355
02:13:01,250 --> 02:13:06,750
So Abdali learns that there
are still brave warriors on this land.

1356
02:13:06,833 --> 02:13:09,125
-Yes, Your Majesty!
-Yes, Your Majesty!

1357
02:13:09,208 --> 02:13:11,792
And as far as our starvation is concerned,

1358
02:13:11,917 --> 02:13:14,750
we will gratify it with
the blood of the enemy!

1359
02:13:20,792 --> 02:13:24,542
-Hail...
-Mahadev!

1360
02:13:34,792 --> 02:13:35,667
Let's go.

1361
02:13:42,625 --> 02:13:45,375
His Highness Vishwas Rao Peshwa,
command us!

1362
02:13:46,292 --> 02:13:48,917
Begin the Square Formation!

1363
02:13:49,500 --> 02:13:50,375
Soldiers!

1364
02:13:51,417 --> 02:13:52,667
Move forward!

1365
02:13:57,000 --> 02:13:58,208
Move forward!

1366
02:14:08,542 --> 02:14:09,375
Respond!

1367
02:15:19,958 --> 02:15:24,083
He thinks he's clever.
He's using a Square Formation tactic.

1368
02:15:24,583 --> 02:15:28,000
We must create the Crescent Formation.
Quickly!

1369
02:15:37,458 --> 02:15:40,792
Crescent Formation!

1370
02:15:42,417 --> 02:15:45,375
A Crescent Formation!

1371
02:15:59,833 --> 02:16:02,833
Elephant Regiment, move forward!

1372
02:16:30,042 --> 02:16:34,042
That's it! Halt!

1373
02:16:41,250 --> 02:16:43,000
Fire!

1374
02:17:00,125 --> 02:17:02,708
Elephant Regiment, move forward!

1375
02:17:08,417 --> 02:17:10,208
Their cannons are moving forward.

1376
02:17:10,833 --> 02:17:13,250
Let's fire our cannons!

1377
02:17:17,917 --> 02:17:23,000
Artillerymen! Load cannons!
Annihilate the enemy!

1378
02:17:28,625 --> 02:17:29,583
Halt!

1379
02:17:36,417 --> 02:17:39,750
Halt! Fire!

1380
02:17:49,083 --> 02:17:52,667
Ibrahim Gardi's cannons are moving
forward and we are unable to take aim.

1381
02:17:54,083 --> 02:18:00,125
Wahab, mount our Zamburak cannons
on the camels and then take aim.

1382
02:18:01,000 --> 02:18:01,958
Yes, Your Majesty!

1383
02:18:19,583 --> 02:18:21,458
Mount the Zamburaks on the camels!

1384
02:18:47,167 --> 02:18:50,917
Quickly, move the camels to a new place!

1385
02:19:22,250 --> 02:19:24,625
Confronting these moveable cannons
is difficult.

1386
02:19:25,583 --> 02:19:30,875
Tell Ibrahim to find their ammunition tent
and destroy it. Go!

1387
02:19:30,958 --> 02:19:32,042
Yes, Your Majesty.

1388
02:19:34,750 --> 02:19:35,958
Load!

1389
02:19:36,042 --> 02:19:41,208
Sir, His Highness's order is to find
their ammunition tent and destroy it.

1390
02:19:44,542 --> 02:19:48,417
Artillerymen!
All cannons, three inches to the left.

1391
02:19:49,375 --> 02:19:50,417
Two inches up!

1392
02:19:53,500 --> 02:19:54,750
Fire!

1393
02:20:11,333 --> 02:20:14,500
All cannons, two inches to the right.

1394
02:20:16,583 --> 02:20:18,125
Fire!

1395
02:20:36,208 --> 02:20:37,958
Sir, we are out of ammunition!

1396
02:20:42,083 --> 02:20:43,333
Get the flag!

1397
02:20:49,042 --> 02:20:50,250
Messenger!

1398
02:20:53,625 --> 02:20:57,542
Tell Ibrahim we have to leave the cannons
and elephants behind and move forward.

1399
02:20:57,625 --> 02:20:59,375
Ready the Riflemen and move forward!

1400
02:20:59,458 --> 02:21:00,500
Yes, Your Majesty.

1401
02:21:03,292 --> 02:21:04,917
Send the Riflemen forward!

1402
02:21:43,042 --> 02:21:45,250
Brace for impact!

1403
02:21:46,167 --> 02:21:48,792
Get ready to attack!

1404
02:21:52,500 --> 02:21:57,917
Huzurat! Move forward!

1405
02:21:59,667 --> 02:22:01,583
Attack!

1406
02:24:52,917 --> 02:24:57,375
It looks like my God is with them too.

1407
02:25:08,625 --> 02:25:10,667
Our soldiers are fleeing!

1408
02:25:15,833 --> 02:25:19,833
Taimur, Wasi, split up into two regiments.

1409
02:25:20,708 --> 02:25:24,583
Unleash the fear of death
on the deserters and bring them back.

1410
02:25:24,667 --> 02:25:25,583
Yes, sir!

1411
02:26:02,625 --> 02:26:04,708
No one will flee the battlefield.

1412
02:26:06,333 --> 02:26:08,958
I'll hunt down every single one of you.

1413
02:26:10,292 --> 02:26:11,292
Return to battle.

1414
02:26:21,208 --> 02:26:23,542
Send them right into
the heat of the battle.

1415
02:26:42,208 --> 02:26:43,167
Wahab...

1416
02:26:44,000 --> 02:26:46,792
Set the rifle's aim on the Peshwa prince.

1417
02:26:48,417 --> 02:26:49,333
Yes, Your Majesty!

1418
02:27:19,458 --> 02:27:20,333
Uncle!

1419
02:29:06,708 --> 02:29:09,458
-Uncle, I...
-Vishwas, I told you...

1420
02:29:14,667 --> 02:29:16,250
Huzurat!

1421
02:29:18,708 --> 02:29:19,625
Uncle!

1422
02:29:19,708 --> 02:29:21,750
Nothing will happen to you.

1423
02:29:21,958 --> 02:29:23,875
The arrow has only hit your shoulder.

1424
02:29:24,917 --> 02:29:26,667
But why did you get off the elephant?

1425
02:29:27,792 --> 02:29:29,125
To save Uncle Shamsher.

1426
02:29:37,875 --> 02:29:41,250
Now that you've been injured,
you've truly become a warrior.

1427
02:29:43,750 --> 02:29:45,333
Huzurat!

1428
02:29:47,917 --> 02:29:50,667
No! Vishwas!

1429
02:30:53,000 --> 02:30:54,625
Forgive me, Vishwas.

1430
02:31:14,500 --> 02:31:15,708
Najib.

1431
02:32:21,000 --> 02:32:25,250
Najib, you're the cause of this all!
Traitor!

1432
02:33:16,917 --> 02:33:17,917
Najib!

1433
02:33:55,458 --> 02:33:56,917
-Hail...
-Mahadev!

1434
02:34:08,167 --> 02:34:10,292
The sand... Throw the sand!

1435
02:35:23,792 --> 02:35:26,167
King Araadhak Singh...

1436
02:35:28,875 --> 02:35:31,042
You need to send your army this way.

1437
02:35:31,125 --> 02:35:33,917
Araadhakpur's army!

1438
02:35:34,958 --> 02:35:37,792
Move back!

1439
02:35:42,875 --> 02:35:44,917
Let Araadhakpur's army retreat!

1440
02:35:50,167 --> 02:35:53,333
Let Araadhakpur's army leave!

1441
02:35:58,125 --> 02:36:01,458
Our army is ready for you!

1442
02:36:03,542 --> 02:36:05,458
-So, shall we send the army?
-No.

1443
02:36:07,083 --> 02:36:10,375
We have already paid our tax.
Now, why shall we send our army?

1444
02:36:11,667 --> 02:36:14,333
We must teach Sadashiv Bhau a lesson.

1445
02:36:15,750 --> 02:36:17,083
What news have you brought?

1446
02:36:17,667 --> 02:36:21,167
The Marathas are reaching the Yamuna bank.

1447
02:36:22,208 --> 02:36:23,917
-Yamuna?
-Yes.

1448
02:36:25,542 --> 02:36:27,500
They want to capture the Doab.

1449
02:36:28,500 --> 02:36:32,708
We were stuck across the Yamuna,
that is why we got delayed.

1450
02:36:32,792 --> 02:36:35,583
Araadhak Singh, your army of 5,000
will always be ready for my command.

1451
02:36:35,667 --> 02:36:36,958
Yes, My Lord.

1452
02:36:38,042 --> 02:36:39,667
I trusted you...

1453
02:36:40,833 --> 02:36:42,250
and you too betrayed us?

1454
02:36:43,833 --> 02:36:45,417
You are the biggest traitor!

1455
02:36:54,333 --> 02:36:57,458
Close in!

1456
02:37:05,625 --> 02:37:08,042
General Malhar Rao,
I can't understand anything from here.

1457
02:37:08,125 --> 02:37:11,167
-Is everything all right?
-All I know is

1458
02:37:11,625 --> 02:37:14,417
that this place isn't safe right now.

1459
02:37:15,000 --> 02:37:16,083
How is Bhau sahib?

1460
02:37:16,667 --> 02:37:20,292
I have come to complete the promise
I had given Bhau sahib.

1461
02:37:20,417 --> 02:37:21,250
What promise?

1462
02:37:22,208 --> 02:37:24,542
The promise to take you all
to a safe place.

1463
02:37:47,958 --> 02:37:49,458
Close in!

1464
02:39:01,333 --> 02:39:04,583
We don't have any time.
This place is not safe!

1465
02:39:54,333 --> 02:39:55,583
Let's go!

1466
02:41:59,458 --> 02:42:02,042
Lady Parvati, Let's go! Quickly!

1467
02:42:02,292 --> 02:42:05,750
Lady Parvati, come on!

1468
02:43:34,083 --> 02:43:37,750
Every single drop of blood...

1469
02:43:38,292 --> 02:43:41,500
fallen here... is screaming...

1470
02:43:43,958 --> 02:43:47,958
Hindostan will never be yours!

1471
02:44:24,875 --> 02:44:28,917
<i>I am ready to die for even</i>
<i>a single grain of dust of my motherland.</i>

1472
02:44:39,417 --> 02:44:41,333
<i>So this was what I witnessed.</i>

1473
02:44:43,375 --> 02:44:45,750
<i>I never recovered from this calamity.</i>

1474
02:44:47,042 --> 02:44:50,625
<i>The world, bereft of my Lord,</i>
<i>meant nothing for me anymore.</i>

1475
02:44:52,125 --> 02:44:53,167
Forgive me!

1476
02:44:54,458 --> 02:44:59,792
Because of me, we both lost our very own.
Forgive me!

1477
02:45:04,583 --> 02:45:10,000
<i>Is this a dream or reality?</i>
<i>Is it a miracle or something else?</i>

1478
02:45:10,125 --> 02:45:14,958
<i>Only you are and you will be my love.</i>

1479
02:45:15,083 --> 02:45:21,917
<i>I guess it was destiny</i>
<i>You were meant for me</i>

1480
02:45:22,875 --> 02:45:28,667
<i>And I was destined to be yours</i>

1481
02:45:29,000 --> 02:45:33,667
<i>My tomorrow, and every day that follows...</i>

1482
02:45:38,583 --> 02:45:39,625
My Lord...

1483
02:45:51,583 --> 02:45:53,042
"Dear Peshwa Nana sahib!

1484
02:45:54,125 --> 02:45:56,208
I was victorious in the Battle of Panipat.

1485
02:45:57,250 --> 02:45:59,875
However, I have returned
to Kandahar with a heavy heart..."

1486
02:46:00,458 --> 02:46:03,458
<i>Sadashiv Rao's face</i>
<i>does not leave my mind.</i>

1487
02:46:04,375 --> 02:46:06,833
<i>When he was fighting bravely</i>
<i>with thousands.</i>

1488
02:46:08,292 --> 02:46:10,542
<i>It is difficult for me</i>
<i>to accept one thing.</i>

1489
02:46:11,042 --> 02:46:12,667
<i>Nonetheless, I will accept it.</i>

1490
02:46:14,083 --> 02:46:16,625
<i>This was the biggest battle of my life.</i>

1491
02:46:18,083 --> 02:46:22,167
<i>And I fought the bravest warriors,</i>
<i>the Marathas!</i>

1492
02:46:23,917 --> 02:46:29,083
<i>And I have fought countless battles</i>
<i>but by god...</i>

1493
02:46:29,750 --> 02:46:32,333
<i>I have never seen a warrior</i>
<i>as valiant as Sadashiv.</i>

1494
02:46:33,292 --> 02:46:38,000
<i>A salute to the Marathas'</i>
<i>bravery, strength and valor.</i>

1495
02:46:39,125 --> 02:46:43,083
<i>God willing, you will continue</i>
<i>ruling your lands.</i>

1496
02:46:44,208 --> 02:46:45,042
<i>Farewell.</i>

1497
02:46:46,125 --> 02:46:47,583
"Ahmad Shah Abdali."

1498
02:46:50,333 --> 02:46:51,958
Sadashiv!

1499
02:46:57,292 --> 02:46:59,000
<i>In history, Abdali was victorious.</i>

1500
02:47:00,250 --> 02:47:02,208
<i>But the future belonged to the Marathas.</i>

1501
02:47:05,375 --> 02:47:07,583
<i>Sardar Mahadji Shinde took revenge.</i>

1502
02:47:09,333 --> 02:47:14,250
<i>And over the next ten years,</i>
<i>re-strengthened the Maratha Empire.</i>

1503
02:47:16,792 --> 02:47:17,625
<i>And...</i>

1504
02:47:19,167 --> 02:47:20,250
<i>Nana Khandvis.</i>

1505
02:47:21,625 --> 02:47:26,833
<i>To maintain the Peshwas monumental reign,</i>
<i>he continued to help them</i>

1506
02:47:28,000 --> 02:47:30,333
<i>in the same way</i>
<i>Sadashiv Rao Bhau Peshwa would.</i>

1507
02:47:40,125 --> 02:47:45,667
<i>We're the ones who broke</i>
<i>The millennial chains of bondage</i>

1508
02:47:46,250 --> 02:47:51,083
<i>The world resonated with</i>
<i>The sound, "Hail Brave Marathas"</i>

1509
02:47:51,167 --> 02:47:56,750
<i>The blood that courses</i>
<i>Through these veins</i>

1510
02:47:56,833 --> 02:48:02,875
<i>Laying down your life for respect</i>
<i>And honor is a small price to pay</i>
