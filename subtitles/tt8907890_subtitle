00:00:48,667 --> 00:00:54,667
The tribes on the hills are his first
children...much forgotten children.

4
00:00:54,958 --> 00:00:58,708
Their land is gold and also
the hills that surround them.

5
00:00:59,083 --> 00:01:01,792
That's their problem too.

6
00:01:02,083 --> 00:01:06,792
Though surrounded by boundless
wealth of Nature's gift,

7
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:09,792
they couldn't claim It as their own.

8
00:01:10,042 --> 00:01:15,125
They are helpless and
remain marginalized.

9
00:01:16,125 --> 00:01:19,458
Though they live on
the top of the earth

10
00:01:19,708 --> 00:01:23,542
the entire world wants
to pull them down.

11
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:30,208
Those who claim to uplift
them actually exploit them.

12
00:01:30,542 --> 00:01:33,667
After getting deceived and
disappointed again and again

13
00:01:33,792 --> 00:01:36,125
fed up of deceitful world

14
00:01:36,292 --> 00:01:39,250
they wanted to lead
a secluded life.

15
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:45,333
However the greedy tradesmen never
allow them to live peacefully .

20
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:09,708

21
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:15,792
and says that it's a plot
against the tribal community.

22
00:02:15,917 --> 00:02:18,417
It has created shock
waves among the public.

23
00:02:18,583 --> 00:02:19,792
Haven't you left yet?

24
00:02:20,042 --> 00:02:22,792
Researching the
forest fire incident.

25
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:25,083
You mean that natural disaster?

26
00:02:25,667 --> 00:02:27,458
Why are you digging into that?

27
00:02:28,875 --> 00:02:30,500
I'm waiting for just
one more evidence.

28
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:31,792
I'll tell you
after getting that.

29
00:02:32,083 --> 00:02:33,292
What evidence?

30
00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:37,583
Hello

31
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:39,750
Tell me Gowri

32
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:42,917
Usha. Everything is ready.

33
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:45,333
We shall now reveal the
truth without any fear.

We are releasing it

36
00:02:51,042 --> 00:02:52,000
Have you got the evidence?

37
00:02:52,083 --> 00:02:53,667
Yes. An important document.

38
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:54,667
What document?

39
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:56,333
No. Can't tell you
that over phone.

40
00:02:56,417 --> 00:02:57,917
You are coming to Priya's
house tomorrow, right ?

41
00:02:57,917 --> 00:02:58,458
Yes.

42
00:02:58,458 --> 00:02:59,583
I'm in the middle of shifting.

43
00:02:59,667 --> 00:03:01,125
-We will meet at Priya's
house tomorrow. -Ok.

44
00:03:01,417 --> 00:03:07,167
This document is the key evidence
to expose the Advaita Company.

45
00:03:08,958 --> 00:03:09,750
Who's that?

46
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:11,792
Who's that?

47
00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:13,083
Gowri.

48
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:16,792
-Hello.
-Usha. Just hold on for a minute.

49
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:26,708
Gowri?

50
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:31,750
Hello?! What happened ?

51
00:03:40,042 --> 00:03:41,083
Hello?

52
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:44,708
Gowri?

53
00:03:50,417 --> 00:03:52,417
Usha. I'll call you again.

54
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:53,708
Okay.

55
00:04:21,917 --> 00:04:22,708
Gowri??!!

56
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:24,583
Hey!

57
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:26,917
Hello

58
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,583
Hello!

59
00:04:37,917 --> 00:04:40,958
[RINGTONE]
"Dad pick up the call"

60
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,292
[News] Gowri,
a popular cine actress,

61
00:04:53,333 --> 00:05:00,208
environmentalist who has been
fighting for the uplift of the tribals

62
00:05:00,292 --> 00:05:05,125
was found murdered at her house,
in Chennai by unidentified persons.

63
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:09,750
In the recent times she has been writing
against encroachment of tribal villages.

64
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:14,417
She has vehemently condemned the
bureaucrats and the political leaders

65
00:05:14,667 --> 00:05:15,792
who are behind
this unlawful act.

66
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:17,500
Did Gowri tell you anything?

67
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:19,958
What's your plan Usha?

68
00:05:20,542 --> 00:05:21,250
Usha?

69
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:26,125
I've to complete what
she has started Sir.

70
00:05:27,542 --> 00:05:28,708
If I don't do even this...

71
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:31,583
I must go to Chennai.

72
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,750
You seem to be firm.
You won't listen to me

73
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:36,167
If you want,
take somebody along from the office.

74
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:37,792
I'll manage sir.

75
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:40,167
Thank you.

76
00:05:41,167 --> 00:05:42,167
Ms. Gowri Krishna,

77
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:44,583
Actor/ Social Activist?

78
00:05:45,583 --> 00:05:47,375
Everyone will have a turning
point in their lives.

79
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:49,750
I entered into Cinema
at a very young age.

80
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,917
My parents raised me so dearly without
showing the difficult side of life.

81
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:57,583
My fate...
I lost them both on the same day.

82
00:05:58,667 --> 00:06:00,125
I was alone,
when I looked around,

83
00:06:00,167 --> 00:06:02,250
everything seemed to
be fake and false.

84
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:06,000
After overcoming that,
when I looked for truth and peace,

85
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,542
I met these innocent tribes.

86
00:07:30,625 --> 00:07:33,292
Though we have everything,
we still keep running after something.

87
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:37,208
Though they don't have anything,
still they have taught me something.

88
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:40,333
I wanted everybody to know
about these beautiful people.

89
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:40,417
My face has helped convey
several fictitious stories.

90
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:44,417
Let it now help unfold a true story
about these tribes to the World.

91
00:08:50,167 --> 00:08:53,875
Wow. What a song.
An Amazing feeling.

92
00:08:54,167 --> 00:08:56,458
I just checked now. This song is
in the play list of all our shows.

93
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,000
Is it a favorite song to everybody?
Ok Let's get back to the business.

94
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:00,125
In the past,
only sensational things became trendy.

95
00:09:00,167 --> 00:09:01,667
Now, anything becomes
sensational and trendy.

96
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:04,750
That being said,
a video has gone viral on Facebook today.

97
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:08,167
Where in we see 4 men
coming out with bags

98
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:09,708
filled with huge
bundles of cash.

99
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:12,792
You might be curious if they're
laundering money or is it black money?

100
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:14,083
I too doubt the same.

101
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:16,833
Do let us know your
opinion about the same.

102
00:09:16,917 --> 00:09:21,250
Before we discuss further,
enjoy a super hit song.

103
00:10:00,042 --> 00:10:02,708
In spite of all our planning,
it become a big flop.

104
00:10:03,792 --> 00:10:05,292
-Rocket. Clear this.
-All are fake notes.

105
00:10:08,167 --> 00:10:09,917
Who could have done this?!

106
00:10:14,667 --> 00:10:16,792
Mike. We went to the correct
address, right?

107
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:18,958
They handed the money
before we even asked.

108
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:21,875
Opened the door
before we knocked

109
00:10:21,917 --> 00:10:23,542
and gave the money
before we showed the Gun.

110
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:28,667
Mike, it was the first time I
was quite nervous before a heist.

111
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:30,083
And it got over in a jiffy.

112
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,542
I just don't get
what's happening.

113
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:35,042
Don't you get it?

114
00:10:36,542 --> 00:10:38,083
Somebody has fooled
us to put a proxy.

115
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:39,750
Proxy??

116
00:10:41,417 --> 00:10:43,208
Are we in a trouble then?

117
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:46,458
We don't know for
whom we have put proxy

118
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:49,000
and who has made us put proxy ?

119
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:53,750
But it's not safe
to mess with Bhai.

120
00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:57,208
They might let it go as such

121
00:10:57,667 --> 00:10:59,125
or might chase us and kill us.

122
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:01,125
Anything could happen.

123
00:11:03,917 --> 00:11:06,000
What shall we do now, Mike ?

124
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:12,250
We should find somebody to
put proxy for us immediately.

125
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:14,208
But it should be a new team.

126
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:16,750
Okay Mike.
We will put a proxy immediately.

127
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:19,667
Mike. Guna has been
arrested by the police.

128
00:11:22,292 --> 00:11:24,458
Let us abscond from this
city for a few days.

129
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:26,667
We shall go abroad.

130
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:29,292
Make the arrangements at once.

131
00:11:29,917 --> 00:11:30,625
Chithu..

132
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:47,208
Hello. Excuse me.

133
00:11:47,542 --> 00:11:48,333
Who are you ?

134
00:11:53,667 --> 00:11:54,333
Proceed.

135
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:57,250
Tell me Madam.

136
00:11:57,792 --> 00:11:59,125
Sir.
I want to go to Gowri's house.

137
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:02,792
If it is a resident inside,
ask someone to take you inside.

138
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:04,208
Sir. I've been staying
here for 2 weeks.

139
00:12:04,292 --> 00:12:06,417
This is a crime spot Madam.

140
00:12:06,542 --> 00:12:07,708
I can't allow anyone.

141
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:09,917
-Sir. I'm a journalist.
-Strictly not allowed.

142
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:11,542
Sir. This is unfair.

143
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:15,083
Guru.

144
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:19,958
Yes sir.

145
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:22,750
Won't you inquire properly
before letting anybody inside?

146
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:23,708
She told me she is
a journalist Sir.

147
00:12:23,792 --> 00:12:24,792
Send her off.

148
00:12:26,042 --> 00:12:27,625
Sir. This is really not fair.

149
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:30,000
Madam. Please come.

150
00:12:34,167 --> 00:12:34,833
Please.

151
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:37,500
Madam. There's no use
in talking to him.

152
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:39,833
All her relatives are at
Royapettah General Hospital.

153
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,292
Until the case is closed,
nobody should be allowed inside.

154
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:43,542
It is an order from the
Forensic Department.

155
00:12:43,583 --> 00:12:44,292
Understand?

156
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,000
Please come.

157
00:12:54,042 --> 00:12:56,167
Akka. I've asked so many times

158
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:57,792
they don't seem to
permit us inside.

159
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:01,125
Look there. That guy has been
staring at us since we got here.

160
00:13:01,792 --> 00:13:03,167
Better we go.

161
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:05,375
Alright. Come on.

162
00:13:51,792 --> 00:13:52,833
Hey, why are you so late?

163
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:55,625
I called Mom. She told me you
left early in the morning.

164
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:56,667
I went to Gowri's house.

165
00:13:57,833 --> 00:13:58,958
What did they say?

166
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,458
They didn't allow us inside.

167
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,167
What do you mean?

168
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:05,208
Surprise!

169
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,250
Hey. How come all of a sudden?

170
00:14:08,292 --> 00:14:09,667
Your sister didn't tell me
that you're coming along.

171
00:14:09,792 --> 00:14:10,958
My sister didn't call me

172
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:12,542
but dad insisted that
I must go with her.

173
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,208
How goes your acting and all?

174
00:14:14,292 --> 00:14:16,667
Going on but no progress so far.

175
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:19,292
Alright. Come in.

176
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:27,792
Akka. I've been noticing you since we came.
Why are you upset?

177
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,208
Don't you know her nature?

178
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:32,167
Come let's go and eat.

179
00:14:40,042 --> 00:14:40,875
One second.

180
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:41,708
Hari.

181
00:14:42,417 --> 00:14:43,625
I wanted to give it personally

182
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:44,833
That's why I didn't give
it during the interview.

183
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:46,208
Oh!

184
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:49,833
Educational kit.
For the tribal kids.

185
00:14:49,917 --> 00:14:52,333
There are 500 more.
Just tell me where to deliver them.

186
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:54,000
Thank you.

187
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:57,375
No other gift could
have made me so happy.

188
00:14:57,667 --> 00:14:58,667
Thank you.

189
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:00,875
I know you too well.

190
00:15:12,417 --> 00:15:14,333
Are you still brooding
over Gowri's house?

191
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:18,917
I keep asking you,
whereas you are just wandering around.

192
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:20,958
Somehow we should have
got into the house today.

193
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:22,625
Something nags me

194
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:25,125
that we have missed
something vital.

195
00:15:25,417 --> 00:15:26,750
Whatever is due to you,

196
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,333
will definitely come to you.

197
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:29,750
Just don't bother.

198
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:32,917
Before we reach the house tomorrow,
they would have swiped off everything.

199
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:36,542
Okay.
What's the plan for tomorrow?

200
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:38,458
First,
we should find where is Bhaskar.

201
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,875
Don't know where he is.

202
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:42,000
I called him.
His phone is not reachable.

203
00:15:42,417 --> 00:15:45,208
Second, we should find out what are the
items mentioned in the Forensic list.

204
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,625
Start eating Boss

205
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:54,125
-Hi
-Hi. Usha.

206
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:56,208
Get me the remote.

207
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:01,125
[On TV] We're really scared

208
00:16:01,167 --> 00:16:03,042
how do you expect us to be
without fear with the kids?

209
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:04,875
In this situation,
Gowri's murder

210
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:06,542
has given rise to
several doubts.

211
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:09,000
Press, Film world

212
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:10,625
-and the tribals.
-Hey, Usha!

213
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:12,958
I thought you were
following some dummy case.

214
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:15,042
You follow such
serious cases too?

215
00:16:16,792 --> 00:16:18,458
Priya was telling that
you get death threats too.

216
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,417
[TV] Social activists
and film fraternity

217
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:25,375
demand a thorough
inquiry in this case.

218
00:16:25,667 --> 00:16:27,250
Very shocking news it is.

219
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:30,042
Even two days back
she came home.

220
00:16:31,042 --> 00:16:33,458
I just could not believe
that she is no more.

221
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:34,875
-Who... Gowri?!
-Yes.

222
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,042
Why did she come here?

223
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:38,708
She came to meet somebody.
And just dropped in.

224
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:42,542
Aren't Aunty and Uncle at home ?

225
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:45,083
They have gone to attend my
cousin's wedding inside the city.

226
00:16:45,583 --> 00:16:46,792
You could not join
them because of us?

227
00:16:46,917 --> 00:16:49,667
No. No. I should be
with her at this time.

228
00:16:51,917 --> 00:16:53,917
What happened to her?

229
00:16:57,458 --> 00:17:00,917
You know, two weeks ago there
was a forest fire in Kodaikanal.

230
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:03,583
It was not a natural disaster.

231
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:07,125
A mining company for
their new project

232
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:09,083
has tried to vacate the
tribal people in that area

233
00:17:09,292 --> 00:17:10,708
But the tribes refused.

234
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:12,583
Before it became
a serious problem,

235
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:14,458
they burnt down
the entire village.

236
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:18,542
Gowri seeked my help to
expose this to the public.

237
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:21,833
In fact, just while telling me after
collecting the necessary evidences...

238
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:24,458
How this was not
known to the Govt.?

239
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:25,792
It was known.

240
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:27,708
But the people concerned
just don't care.

241
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:28,917
Why?

242
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:32,583
Because for them,
whether these tribes live or not,

243
00:17:33,042 --> 00:17:34,083
it doesn't matter.

244
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:37,250
We are talking about people who
don't even have ration cards.

245
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:39,917
What's your plan now?

246
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:42,750
First should find
out, where is Bhaskar.

247
00:17:43,042 --> 00:17:44,958
Don't know if he's alive or not.

248
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:47,875
Tried calling his phone.
It's not reachable.

249
00:17:49,417 --> 00:17:50,750
Eat quickly.

250
00:17:51,167 --> 00:17:52,458
Got so much to be done tomorrow.

251
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:56,917
I don't think we are
involved in this sir.

252
00:17:58,542 --> 00:18:00,417
Yes Sir.
Sir. Please trust me.

253
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:03,000
I will take care of
the situation sir.

254
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Sir. Please.

255
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:07,292
Good day sir.

256
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,917
I didn't send you there
to commit a murder.

257
00:18:15,792 --> 00:18:16,958
I sent you to
retrieve the document.

258
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:19,333
If murdering was our idea,
I wouldn't send you there

259
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:22,792
Do you know how many persons
are in trouble because of this ?

260
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:29,083
If that document falls
into somebody's hands,

261
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,792
so many bigwigs will be doomed.

262
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:36,958
Have you searched
the entire house?

263
00:18:37,167 --> 00:18:38,875
I've searched thoroughly.
But I could not find it.

264
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:42,875
Look. I don't know what
you're going to do and how.

265
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:45,542
Within 24 hours,
the document must come to my hands.

266
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:48,542
If not, in order to escape, Sait

267
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:52,750
will finish you,
me and everybody involved in this matter.

268
00:18:53,917 --> 00:18:54,792
Got it?

269
00:19:13,667 --> 00:19:15,333
Me and Priya are attending
a wedding tomorrow.

270
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:16,542
There's also an
after party plan.

271
00:19:16,667 --> 00:19:18,000
You are welcome to join us.

272
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:19,792
Just in case, if we are
late, use these keys.

273
00:19:22,042 --> 00:19:23,375
Are you a GVM fan?

274
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:25,167
Why are you wearing this wristlet?

275
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:27,000
This is called Kara.

276
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,375
A present from my Sikh friend.

277
00:19:29,917 --> 00:19:32,625
One of the five things a
Sikh should always have.

278
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:33,583
I don't get that.

279
00:19:34,542 --> 00:19:36,542
A Sikh must always
carry five things along.

280
00:19:36,917 --> 00:19:37,625
Kesh
[Hair]

281
00:19:38,167 --> 00:19:38,958
Kanga
[Comb]

282
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:40,208
Kara
[Wristlet]

283
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:41,542
Kachcha
[Underpants]

284
00:19:42,042 --> 00:19:42,833
Kirpan
[Dagger]

285
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:43,917
Oh!

286
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,458
What were you asking?

287
00:19:45,875 --> 00:19:47,542
I asked if you are a GVM fan?

288
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:49,875
GVM means?

289
00:19:50,042 --> 00:19:52,042
Gautham Vasudev Menon.

290
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:57,583
Why did he present you this?

291
00:19:57,625 --> 00:19:59,208
He's an arm wrestling champion.

292
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:01,375
Still he lost to me. That's why.

293
00:20:15,292 --> 00:20:16,750
Dei. Who are they?

294
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:18,250
Is this your gang?

295
00:20:18,958 --> 00:20:20,292
Where are you in this?

296
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:25,292
Tell me.

297
00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:28,125
Why don't you watch the entire
video before you ask something ?

298
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:32,250
How much did you get for this?

299
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:35,417
Only a small share
for carrying out.

300
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,625
The Lion's share goes to the
one who sketches the plan.

301
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:41,458
Who are you in this?

302
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:53,667
No issues from the police?

303
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:58,000
-I'm speaking to you
-Wait. Coming.

304
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:05,208
I'm speaking to you damn it.

305
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:07,500
-Hey...
-Hey!

306
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:09,167
Why are you asking
so many questions?

307
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,500
They are not some ordinary gang.

308
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:16,208
They confirm who has got huge money and
plan where and when to lay him and escape.

309
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:19,250
Somebody who doesn't like them has
involved them in Bhai's matter.

310
00:21:19,417 --> 00:21:21,750
Bhai is more shrewd and would
not let anybody double cross him.

311
00:21:21,917 --> 00:21:25,167
Mike, before he exits wants
to plan for a Big sum.

312
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:26,083
Understood?

313
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:27,583
Now you listen to
my plan for you.

314
00:21:28,292 --> 00:21:30,500
There was a guy called Guna.
He's now in the police custody.

315
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:32,833
I want you to join in his place.

316
00:21:33,167 --> 00:21:36,833
There is no need
to fear the police.

317
00:21:37,292 --> 00:21:38,417
If any problem arises

318
00:21:38,833 --> 00:21:40,042
we shall put the blame on Mike.

319
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:42,625
-Who's on the phone?
-Michael!

320
00:21:43,833 --> 00:21:44,875
Don't answer. I'm coming.

321
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:54,875
Listen buddy

322
00:21:55,958 --> 00:21:57,417
Mike is very sharp

323
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,250
He hates people who lie to him.

324
00:21:59,625 --> 00:22:02,333
Whatever we steal,
the whole lot should go only to his table.

325
00:22:02,792 --> 00:22:04,833
And we get whatever he decides.

326
00:22:05,542 --> 00:22:06,917
But why should I join him?

327
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,750
It's safe to do
things individually.

328
00:22:08,958 --> 00:22:11,083
Because Mike will
be shifting now.

329
00:22:11,292 --> 00:22:12,375
He is already under radar.

330
00:22:12,542 --> 00:22:14,083
If Mike leaves,
Chithappa too will leave.

331
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:17,083
If both are gone, it's just going to be
me, you and Rocket.

332
00:22:26,083 --> 00:22:26,708
Brother.

333
00:22:27,542 --> 00:22:28,750
I don't know anything.

334
00:22:28,833 --> 00:22:31,167
I was staying here
with her for two weeks.

335
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,500
I told you I don't
know anything.

336
00:22:44,458 --> 00:22:45,125
Brother.

337
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,750
I have informed everything
to the police already.

338
00:22:47,958 --> 00:22:50,042
No brother,
I came to ask for a match box.

339
00:23:01,875 --> 00:23:03,375
I don't have anything
to with this.

340
00:23:03,458 --> 00:23:05,000
I'm only her driver.

341
00:23:11,083 --> 00:23:12,250
Would you like to
try a Cigarette?

342
00:23:12,625 --> 00:23:14,083
I don't smoke cigarettes.

343
00:23:14,708 --> 00:23:17,083
You smoke beedi but not this?

344
00:23:17,333 --> 00:23:18,708
This is better
than that brother.

345
00:23:18,833 --> 00:23:20,375
Have you ever smoked Beedi?

346
00:23:20,417 --> 00:23:21,208
Never tried.

347
00:24:13,625 --> 00:24:15,375
By the way,
where do you hail from?

348
00:24:15,417 --> 00:24:16,292
Kanyakumari.

349
00:24:17,167 --> 00:24:18,417
Since how long you
have been in Chennai?

350
00:24:18,583 --> 00:24:20,708
Almost 9 years.

351
00:24:30,792 --> 00:24:34,083
Brother. On seeing me, you said you
have informed everything to the Police.

352
00:24:34,292 --> 00:24:35,958
Did they grill you that much?

353
00:24:36,792 --> 00:24:37,875
Yes brother.

354
00:24:38,208 --> 00:24:40,583
Were you on duty
during that incident?

355
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:45,250
So you are here to gather
information from me.

356
00:24:45,333 --> 00:24:47,458
No. No.
Nothing of that sort brother.

357
00:24:49,542 --> 00:24:50,792
Who's that lady by the way?

358
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:52,792
She's a media person brother.

359
00:24:53,292 --> 00:24:54,250
Alright. I'll carry on.

360
00:24:55,792 --> 00:24:57,042
Did the watchman
tell you anything?

361
00:24:57,125 --> 00:24:57,958
No.

362
00:24:58,333 --> 00:24:59,042
Look at this.

363
00:24:59,708 --> 00:25:01,167
Only this vehicle has
crossed during that time.

364
00:25:01,542 --> 00:25:04,042
I inquired around,
but no one knows anything.

365
00:25:06,333 --> 00:25:07,750
Brother, just a minute

366
00:25:08,708 --> 00:25:10,125
Do you know whose car it is?

367
00:25:11,792 --> 00:25:14,000
This is a car that usually
comes to this house.

368
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:15,042
Give me that.

369
00:25:17,083 --> 00:25:17,792
Is it him?

370
00:25:18,292 --> 00:25:20,292
Yes. He's the one.

371
00:25:20,667 --> 00:25:21,708
-Who is he?
-Bhaskar.

372
00:25:30,833 --> 00:25:32,542
I've been to his
house just once.

373
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:34,083
Guess we should take this right.

374
00:25:56,292 --> 00:25:58,833
Sir, please let me go.
I've no clue about it

375
00:25:58,958 --> 00:26:00,542
If you don't come
out with the truth,

376
00:26:00,625 --> 00:26:02,125
you'll be buried alive.

377
00:26:14,917 --> 00:26:17,667
Why have you come here?

378
00:26:17,792 --> 00:26:19,875
Sir. I'm Usha. Gowri's friend.

379
00:26:20,375 --> 00:26:21,583
You did mention it yesterday.

380
00:26:22,375 --> 00:26:24,375
I want to meet the inspector
regarding Gowri's case.

381
00:26:25,042 --> 00:26:27,375
Hey! Why does he
keep on screaming?

382
00:26:29,042 --> 00:26:30,917
-You tell me.
-I want to lodge a complaint Sir.

383
00:26:31,333 --> 00:26:33,208
Please wait.
Inspector will be here in a while.

384
00:26:36,167 --> 00:26:38,125
Brother. Get him some food.

385
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:51,375
Good morning Sir.

386
00:26:53,875 --> 00:26:55,833
Did the accused say anything?

387
00:26:55,917 --> 00:26:57,083
He hasn't spoken yet.

388
00:26:57,667 --> 00:26:59,167
Guru sir is on investigation.

389
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:00,625
Alright.

390
00:27:09,375 --> 00:27:11,000
-Sir.
-Take your seat.

391
00:27:14,167 --> 00:27:15,917
Couldn't get any
clue from him Sir.

392
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,167
He doesn't utter a word.

393
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,250
He's very stubborn Sir.

394
00:27:19,375 --> 00:27:20,750
He's just blabbering.

395
00:27:21,083 --> 00:27:22,375
When are you leaving for Temple?

396
00:27:22,542 --> 00:27:24,250
In another two days?

397
00:27:24,417 --> 00:27:25,583
-In two days?
-Yes, Sir.

398
00:27:25,625 --> 00:27:27,042
Even if it takes two months,

399
00:27:27,167 --> 00:27:28,542
you are not going anywhere
until this case is over.

400
00:27:29,167 --> 00:27:32,500
I told you to shave your beard.
Why didn't you?

401
00:27:32,792 --> 00:27:34,250
I will take it off after
the temple visit Sir.

402
00:27:35,833 --> 00:27:36,583
Hey...

403
00:27:37,417 --> 00:27:39,792
Show all that devotion
towards your duty.

404
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,083
So that God will be glad.
Leave now.

405
00:28:02,917 --> 00:28:04,167
Madam.
Sir is calling you inside.

406
00:28:04,208 --> 00:28:05,083
Come on.

407
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:09,333
Be seated.

408
00:28:11,833 --> 00:28:12,833
What is the matter?

409
00:28:12,958 --> 00:28:14,708
Sir. Gowri is my friend.

410
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,750
I want to talk with you
regarding that case.

411
00:28:16,792 --> 00:28:18,250
How are you related to Gowri?

412
00:28:18,792 --> 00:28:20,708
She was my school
mate and colleague.

413
00:28:21,083 --> 00:28:22,292
What about you?

414
00:28:22,917 --> 00:28:24,083
No. I just accompanied her.

415
00:28:24,292 --> 00:28:26,042
Do you know Gowri?

416
00:28:27,167 --> 00:28:28,792
Then please leave.

417
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:31,083
Sir,
can you please leave sooner?

418
00:28:32,042 --> 00:28:33,333
-I'll wait outside.
-Okay.

419
00:28:35,542 --> 00:28:37,250
Sir.
Gowri and I were schoolmates.

420
00:28:39,083 --> 00:28:41,333
So what do you want me to do?

421
00:28:41,708 --> 00:28:44,292
I came to know that her assistant
Bhaskar has been arrested.

422
00:28:44,667 --> 00:28:46,583
He is here only. Just a minute.

423
00:28:48,083 --> 00:28:50,083
Hello. Tell me sir.

424
00:28:51,125 --> 00:28:53,208
Only one among the
five has been caught.

425
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:54,667
He seems to be a new fellow.

426
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:57,208
Investigations are going on.
Will update you if any.

427
00:29:10,083 --> 00:29:12,042
What were you saying?

428
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:13,625
Can I meet Bhaskar?

429
00:29:14,458 --> 00:29:19,667
Look madam. We can't allow a media
person to talk with the prime suspect.

430
00:29:19,833 --> 00:29:21,500
Sir. I'm not here
as a media person.

431
00:29:21,667 --> 00:29:24,417
Whoever you might be.
I can't permit that Madam.

432
00:29:24,542 --> 00:29:25,792
Why have you arrested him Sir?

433
00:29:25,917 --> 00:29:27,833
Have you produced him at
the Local Magistrate Court?

434
00:29:28,292 --> 00:29:31,000
He has been the last person
to visit that lady that night.

435
00:29:31,125 --> 00:29:35,000
Apart from the lady, only his finger
prints were found inside the house.

436
00:29:35,208 --> 00:29:39,875
He is the main suspect among the
last 2 persons she had contacted.

437
00:29:40,125 --> 00:29:41,708
Don't try to teach me my job.

438
00:29:42,417 --> 00:29:44,292
Alright. What is your name?

439
00:29:44,958 --> 00:29:45,708
Usha.

440
00:29:50,167 --> 00:29:53,292
7822528729

441
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:55,417
-is your contact number right?
-Yes.

442
00:29:58,417 --> 00:30:01,958
She has made her last call
to you before her death.

443
00:30:03,583 --> 00:30:05,375
What was so important to be
discussed in that odd hour?

444
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:07,000
She wanted me to come
to Chennai immediately.

445
00:30:07,333 --> 00:30:09,750
But before we could speak further,
the call got disconnected.

446
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,542
I did try calling her again.
But there was no response.

447
00:30:14,417 --> 00:30:17,292
Shanmugam.
Get a statement from her.

448
00:30:18,792 --> 00:30:20,458
Sir.
I really have to meet Bhaskar.

449
00:30:20,542 --> 00:30:22,250
Madam. How many times
should I tell you?

450
00:30:22,292 --> 00:30:22,667
Please come madam.

451
00:30:22,708 --> 00:30:23,833
You just can't meet him.

452
00:30:23,917 --> 00:30:25,500
Hey. Get a statement
and send her off.

453
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:36,833
Okay. Should I act as
if I knew everything

454
00:30:36,875 --> 00:30:38,750
or I knew nothing?

455
00:30:38,875 --> 00:30:40,458
Speak only about what you know.

456
00:30:40,625 --> 00:30:42,292
Don't talk about anything
that you do not know.

457
00:30:43,333 --> 00:30:45,083
Else you'll be caught. Got it?

458
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:51,708
What were you doing earlier?

459
00:31:01,792 --> 00:31:02,583
Chithu

460
00:31:08,542 --> 00:31:11,458
-What is this?
-A theft that I did in my my place.

461
00:31:12,917 --> 00:31:16,333
Getting your name on the newspaper
is a great feat at my place.

462
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:19,542
Are you a that big
Rogue in your place?

463
00:31:20,583 --> 00:31:21,333
What else?

464
00:31:22,042 --> 00:31:23,667
5 or 6 chain snatching

465
00:31:24,667 --> 00:31:27,458
Jewelry from the neighborhood

466
00:31:28,917 --> 00:31:30,583
Also I've stolen
a lot of vehicles

467
00:31:30,792 --> 00:31:32,333
Vehicles? You mean truck?

468
00:31:33,667 --> 00:31:35,000
I've stolen many bicycles.

469
00:31:35,125 --> 00:31:35,958
Cycles!

470
00:31:37,458 --> 00:31:40,417
I've snatched many
mobile phones too.

471
00:31:40,792 --> 00:31:43,250
You brag, as if people roam
with iphones in your place.

472
00:31:45,083 --> 00:31:47,875
Look. Whatever you said
could be done in your place.

473
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,208
Not here.

474
00:31:49,542 --> 00:31:51,375
Even if somebody suspects
that you're going to steal,

475
00:31:51,667 --> 00:31:53,417
you'll be beaten to pulp here.

476
00:31:53,458 --> 00:31:55,667
Nothing of that sort.
Tell me what I should lift,

477
00:31:55,792 --> 00:31:56,792
I'll prove you I'm capable.

478
00:31:57,458 --> 00:32:00,375
Choose someone you like here

479
00:32:00,708 --> 00:32:03,292
and steal whatever you could.

480
00:32:03,625 --> 00:32:06,083
If you could do it right,

481
00:32:06,333 --> 00:32:08,208
you shall join us
while we leave.

482
00:32:08,792 --> 00:32:12,292
If not,
just go back to your place.

483
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,542
And if something goes
wrong in between,

484
00:32:14,667 --> 00:32:16,167
we part ways.

485
00:32:16,792 --> 00:32:18,542
All the time you've got to steal

486
00:32:18,708 --> 00:32:20,625
is only until we are here.

487
00:32:23,167 --> 00:32:23,958
Got it?

488
00:32:26,833 --> 00:32:27,417
Go.

489
00:32:43,583 --> 00:32:45,958
Chitu, I'm done!

490
00:33:02,792 --> 00:33:04,083
Hey Durai.

491
00:33:06,583 --> 00:33:07,500
Sit down Chithu.

492
00:33:08,333 --> 00:33:09,333
How are you doing?

493
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:10,833
I'm good.

494
00:33:10,833 --> 00:33:12,375
I heard the bird won't
fly without your consent.

495
00:33:12,458 --> 00:33:13,458
You're right.

496
00:33:14,458 --> 00:33:16,500
Okay. Let me come to
the point straight.

497
00:33:17,083 --> 00:33:18,542
I can't stay here
for a long time.

498
00:33:18,667 --> 00:33:20,167
Bai's men are spying on me.

499
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:23,667
I hope you're aware of it.

500
00:34:10,667 --> 00:34:12,500
It's a very huge sum of money

501
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:14,875
don't toy around with
me in this situation.

502
00:34:15,125 --> 00:34:16,833
Anyone can do your job...

503
00:34:16,958 --> 00:34:19,958
...I'm not a fool
to lower my price.

504
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:40,292
If you try to cheat me after getting
money, I'll finish you.

505
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:19,333
Who's that inside?

506
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,250
Hey, who is that? Hey!

507
00:35:24,042 --> 00:35:25,500
Hey, who the hell are you?

508
00:35:30,917 --> 00:35:31,458
Hey.

509
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:32,708
What were you doing inside?

510
00:35:32,875 --> 00:35:33,833
-Hey...
-Hey

511
00:35:33,958 --> 00:35:34,708
Hey!

512
00:35:36,542 --> 00:35:37,625
What the hell were
you doing inside?

513
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:46,500
Who the hell are you?

514
00:35:46,542 --> 00:35:49,417
You should remember this,
before you lay hands on any girl

515
00:36:06,708 --> 00:36:09,625
Hello. The document is
with you right now or not?

516
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:13,708
If I don't get the
document by tonight,

517
00:36:14,083 --> 00:36:16,792
the information on Gowri's
murderer will be out.

518
00:36:24,708 --> 00:36:25,333
Mike.

519
00:36:26,167 --> 00:36:27,875
-Where were you?
-Where is Dilli?

520
00:36:28,167 --> 00:36:30,250
He has gone looking for you.

521
00:36:30,375 --> 00:36:32,458
What happened?
Why is your face bruised?

522
00:36:33,875 --> 00:36:35,792
A bloody guy beat me up.

523
00:36:38,625 --> 00:36:39,833
Got caught stealing?

524
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:41,833
No Mike. You come.
You come inside.

525
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:45,917
Who has the drug?

526
00:36:47,958 --> 00:36:50,042
The drug is with me.

527
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:51,833
You come with me Mike.
We should go inside.

528
00:36:51,917 --> 00:36:53,125
We gotta beat him up.

529
00:36:53,875 --> 00:36:54,917
Get into the car.

530
00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:58,792
No Mike.
He laid his hands on me.

531
00:36:58,917 --> 00:37:00,667
You come. You come inside Mike.

532
00:37:00,708 --> 00:37:01,833
I said, get into the car.

533
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Hey.
Will you keep on talking back?

534
00:37:04,208 --> 00:37:05,417
Get inside the car.

535
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:07,750
Damn it!

536
00:37:12,583 --> 00:37:13,292
What is it?

537
00:37:13,333 --> 00:37:15,458
Chithu.
Call and ask them to come.

538
00:37:16,083 --> 00:37:17,375
-Mike!
-Hello

539
00:37:17,583 --> 00:37:18,833
He is the one.
He's the one who hit me.

540
00:37:19,208 --> 00:37:21,458
-The one inside that car.
-Come fast guys.

541
00:37:21,625 --> 00:37:23,333
Wait Selvam. Just calm down.

542
00:37:23,542 --> 00:37:25,708
Mike. Did you look at that car?

543
00:37:25,958 --> 00:37:27,375
Mike. Let's corner him.

544
00:37:27,875 --> 00:37:28,958
Just wait Selvam.

545
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,167
I do pity you.

546
00:37:34,292 --> 00:37:35,542
Would you like to have
something to eat ?

547
00:37:36,875 --> 00:37:39,750
Sir. Wasn't he demoted
from the Egmore station?

548
00:37:40,292 --> 00:37:41,333
So stiff necked.

549
00:37:41,958 --> 00:37:45,250
You media people,
make sure to do a background

550
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:47,417
check, before arriving
at a Police Station.

551
00:37:48,167 --> 00:37:50,833
Okay. Why do want
to meet Bhaskar now?

552
00:37:51,708 --> 00:37:52,958
Two weeks ago,

553
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:56,208
you know there was a forest fire in
the Kavunji forest near Kodaikanal

554
00:37:56,333 --> 00:37:58,667
causing the death of 45 tribes.

555
00:37:58,750 --> 00:37:59,500
Yes.

556
00:38:00,542 --> 00:38:02,542
An accident.

557
00:38:03,125 --> 00:38:04,500
It was not an accident sir.

558
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,250
It was a plot by the
Government and the Corporates.

559
00:38:09,333 --> 00:38:11,458
Gowri came to know that the
Government too was involved in that.

560
00:38:12,083 --> 00:38:13,542
She wanted that to be
exposed to the public.

561
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:17,000
Also she wanted to get justice
for those 45 innocent victims.

562
00:38:17,167 --> 00:38:19,000
-But before that..
-Gowri was dead.

563
00:38:21,125 --> 00:38:26,083
How is that related to your
hurry in meeting Bhaskar?

564
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:29,625
Sir. Gowri had an important
document regarding this issue.

565
00:38:30,542 --> 00:38:32,875
I want to know if Bhaskar knew
anything about that document.

566
00:38:33,042 --> 00:38:35,625
All I need is just
5 minutes Sir.

567
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,833
I'll be in trouble if
I permit you inside.

568
00:38:39,958 --> 00:38:41,292
Already he is nagging me.

569
00:38:41,417 --> 00:38:42,625
He'll be here any moment.

570
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,125
-He will yell at me.
-Please sir.

571
00:38:46,292 --> 00:38:49,167
-Only 5 minutes. Got it?
-Ok, Sir.

572
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:55,083
Be careful.

573
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:57,792
How did you find
out that I'm here?

574
00:38:57,875 --> 00:39:00,417
I tried calling you many times.
Your number was not reachable.

575
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:02,083
Couldn't find you
at your house too.

576
00:39:02,292 --> 00:39:05,208
That's when your house owner informed
that you've been arrested by the police.

577
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:08,667
Bhaskar, did Gowri tell
you about any document?

578
00:39:09,667 --> 00:39:15,417
10 days back,
a surveyor from Kodaikanal met Madam.

579
00:39:16,417 --> 00:39:19,208
Madam,
the survey report I submitted

580
00:39:19,542 --> 00:39:23,500
the district Thasildar and Forest
officials have manipulated it

581
00:39:23,708 --> 00:39:28,208
and trying to sell a non leasable
zone to a corporate company illegally.

582
00:39:28,583 --> 00:39:31,625
They have also transferred
the DFO who questioned them.

583
00:39:32,042 --> 00:39:34,583
I'm confused about whom to
approach regarding this.

584
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,583
That's why I wanted to meet you.

585
00:39:38,833 --> 00:39:43,333
He handed the original
survey document to Madam

586
00:39:43,583 --> 00:39:47,917
and also assured that
corroborate at any place.

587
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:52,917
Two days after that,
we received a news that he was dead.

588
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:56,833
Madam realized it was not safe to
keep the document with her anymore.

589
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,167
And so she kept it at one
of her friend's house.

590
00:40:00,208 --> 00:40:02,500
She was disturbed while
speaking to me two days back

591
00:40:02,833 --> 00:40:04,292
She wanted to discuss
everything only in person

592
00:40:04,375 --> 00:40:06,167
and asked me to come to Priya's
house instead of her house.

593
00:40:08,208 --> 00:40:09,500
Only now I could relate.

594
00:40:13,625 --> 00:40:15,958
-Isn't she picking up the call?
-I've tried several times.

595
00:40:16,667 --> 00:40:18,333
She's not picking up the call.

596
00:40:18,667 --> 00:40:20,375
I have the keys. So let's go.

597
00:40:20,667 --> 00:40:21,833
Okay.

598
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,250
Akka.
The ground floor is locked.

599
00:41:18,875 --> 00:41:20,250
I've searched the entire house.

600
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:22,208
I could not find anything.

601
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,167
I think they are here.

602
00:41:31,708 --> 00:41:34,250
Boss. Why are you bleeding?

603
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:36,000
Nothing to worry.

604
00:41:36,042 --> 00:41:37,958
You guys carry on.
I'll freshen up.

605
00:41:38,542 --> 00:41:39,875
Boss, what happened?

606
00:41:40,083 --> 00:41:41,458
A small problem at the pub.

607
00:41:41,625 --> 00:41:43,125
Ended up fighting with someone.

608
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
What's the problem?

609
00:41:45,208 --> 00:41:47,417
Chuck it.
What happened with you?

610
00:41:47,625 --> 00:41:49,083
You told me that Gowri
had come here that day.

611
00:41:49,167 --> 00:41:49,917
Yes.

612
00:41:50,292 --> 00:41:51,292
What happened actually?

613
00:41:51,333 --> 00:41:53,875
She just dropped in while
returning after visiting a friend.

614
00:41:53,958 --> 00:41:56,000
No. Recollect and
tell me exactly.

615
00:41:58,083 --> 00:42:01,042
She came. I offered her tea.

616
00:42:01,667 --> 00:42:03,375
She agreed.
I left for making tea.

617
00:42:04,292 --> 00:42:05,792
She wanted to use the restroom.

618
00:42:06,167 --> 00:42:06,833
Over here?

619
00:42:06,875 --> 00:42:09,458
No. That's my in-law's room.
Even we don't use it.

620
00:42:09,542 --> 00:42:10,542
She used the restroom
on the first floor.

621
00:42:10,667 --> 00:42:12,708
That room is locked. Keys?

622
00:42:13,958 --> 00:42:14,750
Here you go.

623
00:42:20,208 --> 00:42:22,292
Priya. Don't open the door.

624
00:42:22,583 --> 00:42:24,250
-Deepak, are you expecting somebody?
-Not at all.

625
00:42:32,583 --> 00:42:35,000
Who is he?
Looks like Aravind Swamy's brother.

626
00:42:35,125 --> 00:42:35,958
Who are you?

627
00:42:36,042 --> 00:42:37,667
Brother.
We have come to meet you only.

628
00:42:37,708 --> 00:42:39,417
Were you at Nungambakkam
half an hour ago?

629
00:42:40,833 --> 00:42:42,292
Yes. What do you want?

630
00:42:42,417 --> 00:42:45,833
What is this brother? I'm talking
politely and you are being rude

631
00:42:46,042 --> 00:42:47,708
You have bashed
one of our buddy.

632
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:49,375
That's why we have
come to sort it out.

633
00:42:50,167 --> 00:42:51,708
Do you know what he did?

634
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:53,208
Whatever he might have done,

635
00:42:53,292 --> 00:42:55,167
how dare you hit him?

636
00:42:56,958 --> 00:42:59,208
Hey,
what the hell do you want now?

637
00:43:07,917 --> 00:43:09,542
Leave me. Leave me.

638
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:10,750
Mugilan.

639
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:12,792
Didn't I tell you that
I'll come back you?

640
00:43:12,875 --> 00:43:14,250
Why do you hide inside
the house like a coward?

641
00:43:14,875 --> 00:43:15,708
Help.

642
00:43:17,458 --> 00:43:18,958
Hey. Catch her man.

643
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:20,375
Help. Help.

644
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:23,333
Mugilan.

645
00:43:29,375 --> 00:43:30,333
Mugilan.

646
00:43:32,875 --> 00:43:33,708
Hey!

647
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:36,917
Leave me. Leave me.

648
00:43:39,250 --> 00:43:40,042
Help!

649
00:43:40,625 --> 00:43:41,375
Help!

650
00:43:41,625 --> 00:43:42,375
Mugilan.

651
00:43:47,833 --> 00:43:49,708
Help. Mugilan.

652
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,708
Hey Rocket,
snatch the phone from her?

653
00:43:58,042 --> 00:43:58,750
Bloody!

654
00:43:58,875 --> 00:44:00,333
Give me the phone.

655
00:44:00,750 --> 00:44:01,667
I said give it to me.

656
00:44:01,750 --> 00:44:02,958
I said give it to me.

657
00:44:03,083 --> 00:44:04,208
Die, damn it.

658
00:45:34,042 --> 00:45:35,667
Bloody!

659
00:45:55,375 --> 00:45:57,042
Rocket, bring those wire tags.

660
00:45:59,708 --> 00:46:01,375
Brother. You're knocked out.

661
00:46:01,625 --> 00:46:05,292
Selvam, check if there's
anyone else inside the house.

662
00:46:18,083 --> 00:46:19,458
Exhausted?

663
00:46:19,792 --> 00:46:21,625
Want an energy drink?

664
00:46:21,917 --> 00:46:24,833
I've come here all the way to
hit him as he touched my friend.

665
00:46:24,917 --> 00:46:27,708
How dare you touch me?

666
00:46:29,167 --> 00:46:31,375
Hey. Whom are you staring at?

667
00:46:31,458 --> 00:46:32,250
What's your name?

668
00:46:33,375 --> 00:46:34,917
Tell me your name!

669
00:46:35,417 --> 00:46:36,042
Usha.

670
00:46:36,167 --> 00:46:38,708
Oh. That's the reason
why you run like that.

671
00:46:38,833 --> 00:46:41,167
Do you think you are P.T.Usha?

672
00:46:41,667 --> 00:46:43,958
If you move a bit,
I'll blow off your knees.

673
00:46:44,708 --> 00:46:46,500
Shall I?

674
00:46:55,250 --> 00:46:56,250
Hey!

675
00:47:11,375 --> 00:47:13,500
Stop staring.
Put it inside the hole and tie them.

676
00:47:21,167 --> 00:47:23,958
Hey. Don't scream.

677
00:47:26,125 --> 00:47:27,292
Pull her away.

678
00:47:30,917 --> 00:47:31,708
Priya.

679
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:34,875
Where's the room key?

680
00:47:35,333 --> 00:47:36,583
Hit him.
Hit him right on the nose I say.

681
00:47:36,625 --> 00:47:37,625
Where the hell is the key?

682
00:47:38,542 --> 00:47:39,750
It's inside that cupboard.

683
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:46,750
Chithu.

684
00:47:55,917 --> 00:47:57,000
Whose house is this?

685
00:47:58,375 --> 00:47:59,583
Didn't you hear that?

686
00:48:02,583 --> 00:48:03,375
Mine.

687
00:48:07,792 --> 00:48:09,125
Who is he to you?

688
00:48:11,417 --> 00:48:12,250
My husband.

689
00:48:14,250 --> 00:48:15,250
Husband.

690
00:48:16,458 --> 00:48:17,500
Your husband

691
00:48:20,042 --> 00:48:21,500
laid his hands on my man.

692
00:48:24,125 --> 00:48:25,625
-What shall we do?
-Mike

693
00:48:26,208 --> 00:48:28,667
There is nothing.
They don't seem to have anything.

694
00:48:32,458 --> 00:48:34,542
Seem to be more broken than us.

695
00:48:48,833 --> 00:48:50,375
Who is Mannarmannan to you?

696
00:48:51,917 --> 00:48:52,792
My father in law.

697
00:48:53,542 --> 00:48:54,625
To you?

698
00:48:57,583 --> 00:48:58,292
Father.

699
00:48:58,917 --> 00:49:01,750
Hey...! Oh my God!

700
00:49:02,250 --> 00:49:04,208
you have beaten
a Prince to pulp.

701
00:49:04,250 --> 00:49:06,167
Don't worry,
nothing is gonna happen

702
00:49:06,208 --> 00:49:07,667
Will smash him back.
Let's go over there.

703
00:49:07,792 --> 00:49:09,833
Come on, slowly be careful.

704
00:49:11,583 --> 00:49:13,750
Come on. Let's get seated there.

705
00:49:14,875 --> 00:49:16,958
Don't panic. Don't panic.
I'm there for you.

706
00:49:17,125 --> 00:49:18,375
I'm there for you.

707
00:49:18,792 --> 00:49:19,958
Nothing will happen.

708
00:49:20,458 --> 00:49:21,042
Ok.

709
00:49:21,167 --> 00:49:23,208
How many petrol
bunks do you own?

710
00:49:25,208 --> 00:49:26,000
Five!

711
00:49:26,792 --> 00:49:29,000
How many are open
24/7 among that?

712
00:49:30,792 --> 00:49:32,417
-Two.
-Two.

713
00:49:32,542 --> 00:49:36,333
I want today's collection
of those two bunks.

714
00:49:36,792 --> 00:49:37,917
Say Yes.

715
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,542
Penalty for hitting my man.

716
00:49:42,083 --> 00:49:44,917
Chithu...take care of it.

717
00:49:48,375 --> 00:49:52,458
Snatch all the phones and
put them on the table.

718
00:49:56,333 --> 00:49:57,958
Hey, move.

719
00:49:58,083 --> 00:49:59,458
Where's your phone?

720
00:50:01,333 --> 00:50:03,208
I think it's somewhere out here

721
00:50:04,458 --> 00:50:06,583
Finally you too have
started your count.

722
00:50:07,292 --> 00:50:09,667
I know you've been
longing to work alone.

723
00:50:10,292 --> 00:50:11,583
Do this right.

724
00:50:12,708 --> 00:50:13,917
I'll set you free.

725
00:50:16,167 --> 00:50:21,083
Dialing. Behave casually.
Understand?

726
00:50:22,708 --> 00:50:23,958
Else she will be smashed.

727
00:50:24,750 --> 00:50:25,417
Go ahead.

728
00:50:27,750 --> 00:50:28,583
Hello.

729
00:50:29,583 --> 00:50:31,708
Raghavan. Have you started?

730
00:50:32,167 --> 00:50:33,375
-I'm about to leave now Sir.
-Speak...

731
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:39,125
Have you picked up the OMR and
ECR petrol bunk collections?

732
00:50:39,333 --> 00:50:40,708
I was just about to Sir.

733
00:50:41,792 --> 00:50:46,167
Okay. Two of my friends
will be there in sometime.

734
00:50:46,458 --> 00:50:51,208
You hand over today's collection
of both the bunks to them.

735
00:50:51,292 --> 00:50:52,458
Today's collection...

736
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:54,625
Raghavan?

737
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:57,208
Okay sir. I'll do as you say.

738
00:50:57,458 --> 00:50:58,833
Alright. I'm hanging up.

739
00:50:59,250 --> 00:51:00,250
Thank you Sir.

740
00:51:02,708 --> 00:51:04,375
There should not be any hitch.

741
00:51:05,208 --> 00:51:07,000
If anything goes wrong,

742
00:51:08,083 --> 00:51:11,708
I'll kill them all one by one.

743
00:51:12,375 --> 00:51:13,208
You follow?

744
00:51:14,125 --> 00:51:15,125
Do you follow?

745
00:51:15,792 --> 00:51:16,625
You should.

746
00:51:22,333 --> 00:51:24,417
Mike. Everything is ready Mike.

747
00:51:25,042 --> 00:51:26,167
Any other help?

748
00:51:27,750 --> 00:51:30,250
Selvam. Here there are separate
IPC sections for Robbery

749
00:51:30,458 --> 00:51:31,792
murder

750
00:51:33,292 --> 00:51:34,750
and rape.

751
00:51:39,417 --> 00:51:42,208
-The last one I mentioned,
-Dilli. Water those plants

752
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:45,250
-I don't like at all.
-He has brought such a moron.

753
00:51:45,417 --> 00:51:46,958
Standing like a statue.

754
00:51:49,542 --> 00:51:51,500
We have come here only to rob.

755
00:51:53,250 --> 00:51:54,250
Understand?

756
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:58,792
Chitu!

757
00:52:15,250 --> 00:52:16,000
Priya.

758
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:20,333
Don't do anything. They will leave
as soon as they get what they want.

759
00:52:21,792 --> 00:52:23,292
Who is murmuring there?

760
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,000
Who was talking here?

761
00:52:26,750 --> 00:52:27,417
Eh?

762
00:52:30,167 --> 00:52:31,667
Won't you keep quiet?

763
00:52:32,167 --> 00:52:34,125
Hey Priya. Hey leave her.

764
00:52:34,208 --> 00:52:35,125
Leave her.

765
00:52:35,167 --> 00:52:37,250
Hey leave her.

766
00:52:43,417 --> 00:52:44,833
Hey. Aravind Swamy.

767
00:52:48,750 --> 00:52:50,250
Mugilan. Let go.

768
00:52:50,833 --> 00:52:51,750
Mugilan.

769
00:52:54,167 --> 00:52:55,083
Mugilan.

770
00:52:57,750 --> 00:52:59,625
Mugilan. Mugilan.

771
00:53:06,292 --> 00:53:07,375
Mugilan.

772
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,542
Die, damn it!

773
00:53:17,583 --> 00:53:18,750
Hey!

774
00:53:30,917 --> 00:53:32,292
Mugilan.

775
00:53:54,417 --> 00:53:55,167
Hey!

776
00:53:56,875 --> 00:53:58,500
How many times should
I repeat you guys?

777
00:53:59,167 --> 00:54:01,292
Break the leg first
when you attack someone.

778
00:54:05,583 --> 00:54:06,708
Mmmm, phew!

779
00:54:07,542 --> 00:54:09,375
Nothing is wrong, sorry sir

780
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:10,708
Sorry sir. I'm really sorry sir.

781
00:54:10,833 --> 00:54:14,792
I got ticked off when you suddenly
got your hands on my shirt.

782
00:54:15,750 --> 00:54:18,042
Don't take me wrong Sir.
What's your name sir?

783
00:54:19,667 --> 00:54:22,167
-Deepak.
-Nice name sir. Nice name.

784
00:54:22,333 --> 00:54:23,542
What do you do?

785
00:54:24,333 --> 00:54:25,208
Actor.

786
00:54:25,250 --> 00:54:26,333
Wow. Actor?

787
00:54:26,667 --> 00:54:28,333
Power star is nothing
compared to you Sir.

788
00:54:28,417 --> 00:54:30,083
You are the next Dhravidar star.

789
00:54:30,875 --> 00:54:32,958
We will be going out now and
you say you are an actor.

790
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,292
How could you come
out without make up?

791
00:54:34,333 --> 00:54:36,042
Let's put on some make up.

792
00:54:36,542 --> 00:54:38,583
Oops. I don't have
anything here with me.

793
00:54:45,417 --> 00:54:46,292
Hey Rocket!

794
00:54:46,708 --> 00:54:48,500
Cool. Cool. Nothing to fear.

795
00:54:48,958 --> 00:54:50,958
See how smart you look now.

796
00:54:51,292 --> 00:54:52,667
Are you badly hurt sir?

797
00:54:55,583 --> 00:54:56,667
What is it chitappu?

798
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,833
Hell with you.
Free his hands first.

799
00:54:58,833 --> 00:55:00,583
Who tied him up? Set him free.

800
00:55:00,792 --> 00:55:03,250
Moron. Turn slightly.
Just slightly.

801
00:55:03,833 --> 00:55:05,917
-Here you go
-Show me

802
00:55:06,958 --> 00:55:07,917
Rocket.

803
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:10,000
Slowly, come on slowly

804
00:55:11,417 --> 00:55:12,708
this leg, move this leg

805
00:55:13,583 --> 00:55:16,500
I'll keep calling your phone
every 15 minutes exactly.

806
00:55:17,042 --> 00:55:19,208
If you don't receive my
call the 18th minute,

807
00:55:19,458 --> 00:55:20,458
don't hesitate

808
00:55:21,292 --> 00:55:22,750
kill them all and escape.

809
00:55:24,750 --> 00:55:27,958
Mike, have you
finished the chocolate?

810
00:55:28,125 --> 00:55:30,208
Thought of starting
it with a sweet.

811
00:55:30,292 --> 00:55:32,000
Sir himself is very sweet.

812
00:55:32,167 --> 00:55:34,250
No worries.
We are going for collection today.

813
00:55:34,458 --> 00:55:36,458
Let's go happily as friends.

814
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:37,708
Come on.

815
00:55:38,417 --> 00:55:41,000
Come on...Do you drive Sir?

816
00:55:41,542 --> 00:55:43,167
You'll drive the car.

817
00:55:43,583 --> 00:55:45,125
I will take the back seat.

818
00:55:45,208 --> 00:55:48,417
We will go for a jolly ride,
finish the collection and get back.

819
00:55:48,542 --> 00:55:50,292
There won't be any problem.
Okay?

820
00:55:52,083 --> 00:55:53,042
Rocket.

821
00:55:53,750 --> 00:55:55,625
Keep an eye on Selvam.

822
00:56:01,375 --> 00:56:04,125
Chithu, weren't you
asking me what is a proxy?

823
00:56:04,208 --> 00:56:05,000
Yes, I did.

824
00:56:05,042 --> 00:56:06,792
-Where's your Gun?
-It's with Selvam.

825
00:56:07,083 --> 00:56:09,500
I look forward to a
major event tonight.

826
00:56:36,583 --> 00:56:37,292
Chithu

827
00:56:38,583 --> 00:56:39,292
What is it Mike?

828
00:56:39,583 --> 00:56:41,500
Do you have Mugilan's phone?

829
00:56:41,958 --> 00:56:43,042
Yes I have it.

830
00:56:45,917 --> 00:56:47,292
Unlock and give it to me

831
00:56:48,375 --> 00:56:51,667
2 5 9 8

832
00:56:52,833 --> 00:56:53,458
Here it is.

833
00:57:01,458 --> 00:57:02,500
Hey Rocket,

834
00:57:03,125 --> 00:57:08,500
collect Mugilan's ATM pin, E mail
password and Online Banking password

835
00:57:08,958 --> 00:57:10,875
message it to me immediately.

836
00:57:13,125 --> 00:57:13,833
Hey!

837
00:57:15,875 --> 00:57:18,833
keep your eyes on the road.

838
00:57:19,292 --> 00:57:21,250
I'll pull your eyes out.
Just drive.

839
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,167
It's been long, since I've
peeked into someone else's phone.

840
00:57:25,667 --> 00:57:27,083
Hey, give me your password.

841
00:57:29,250 --> 00:57:30,500
Hey, tell me your password.

842
00:57:31,208 --> 00:57:32,208
Sir. No sir. Please don't.

843
00:57:32,292 --> 00:57:33,583
Just answer to the question.

844
00:57:34,167 --> 00:57:36,083
You are a thumb impression case.
Give me your thumb.

845
00:57:37,458 --> 00:57:38,042
Go.

846
00:57:39,917 --> 00:57:42,458
Oh! So many women?!

847
00:57:44,417 --> 00:57:46,542
Don't you have male
friends at all?

848
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,583
I think I should thrash
you for this very reason.

849
00:57:49,125 --> 00:57:51,417
Who is Pallavi?
Showing all her teeth.

850
00:57:52,292 --> 00:57:53,750
Oh my God!

851
00:57:54,583 --> 00:57:55,750
Sir. Please don't sir.

852
00:57:55,792 --> 00:57:57,583
Let me take this girl's number.

853
00:58:04,250 --> 00:58:06,458
Hey,
are you a porn actor or what?

854
00:58:06,667 --> 00:58:08,667
Chithu, why are you teasing him?

855
00:58:08,708 --> 00:58:10,750
He has been in a
video even yesterday.

856
00:58:10,792 --> 00:58:12,042
How could I resist teasing him?

857
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:14,208
What is this Tinder?

858
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:15,500
So many women

859
00:58:16,792 --> 00:58:19,667
Tin. Tin. Tin. Tin. Tinder.

860
00:58:20,375 --> 00:58:21,542
Won't you sleep at all?

861
00:58:21,875 --> 00:58:22,708
Oh horrible.

862
00:58:34,292 --> 00:58:36,000
He has made me watch some crap.

863
00:58:37,125 --> 00:58:41,042
My eyes are gone Mike.

864
00:59:00,208 --> 00:59:01,417
How did you join Selvam?

865
00:59:04,708 --> 00:59:05,875
I know him.

866
00:59:06,208 --> 00:59:07,042
That means?

867
00:59:07,667 --> 00:59:08,583
He is my friend.

868
00:59:09,375 --> 00:59:10,542
He showed me a video

869
00:59:11,208 --> 00:59:13,375
-and asked if I would like to join him?
-The flat video?

870
00:59:17,417 --> 00:59:19,125
How much did you
get from that flat?

871
00:59:20,083 --> 00:59:22,292
-One.
-One means?

872
00:59:25,042 --> 00:59:25,958
You mean 1 lakh?

873
00:59:28,667 --> 00:59:30,667
If that could fetch 1 Lakh,
how can we make of this house?

874
00:59:31,458 --> 00:59:33,333
First,
let us get out from here safely.

875
00:59:33,542 --> 00:59:34,917
We'll see the rest later.

876
00:59:37,833 --> 00:59:39,958
By the way, I'm Rocket.

877
00:59:41,792 --> 00:59:42,458
Dilli!

878
00:59:44,792 --> 00:59:47,417
Hey Selvam!
Hey Selvam listen to me

879
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:48,417
Hey Selvam!

880
00:59:48,708 --> 00:59:49,792
Hey, leave him.

881
00:59:50,250 --> 00:59:52,250
I said leave him alone.

882
00:59:52,833 --> 00:59:55,167
We are here to rob. Not to kill.

883
00:59:55,750 --> 00:59:58,833
He has seen all of us.
It is not wise to leave him alive.

884
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,292
You can't say that.

885
01:00:01,875 --> 01:00:02,792
Let the boss say.

886
01:00:03,375 --> 01:00:07,292
Plan was to kill him, but your Boss
sketched another to loot the place.

887
01:00:07,583 --> 01:00:10,250
Hey. Mind your words.

888
01:00:10,375 --> 01:00:11,875
Don't run your
mouth as you wish.

889
01:00:12,208 --> 01:00:14,000
I don't care about
the damn money.

890
01:00:14,417 --> 01:00:16,458
I just want to kill him tonight.

891
01:00:17,708 --> 01:00:19,083
How dare you laid
your hands on me?

892
01:00:19,417 --> 01:00:20,458
Go away.

893
01:00:21,792 --> 01:00:23,500
-Can't you hear me?
-Damn it!

894
01:00:23,958 --> 01:00:25,583
-I'm gonna take care of it
-Let's see

895
01:00:25,625 --> 01:00:27,208
-Let me see how he survives this night.
-Just get away.

896
01:00:28,417 --> 01:00:29,083
Hey!

897
01:00:30,125 --> 01:00:32,125
-what is this?
-Water for him.

898
01:00:35,167 --> 01:00:36,083
-Dilli!
-So...

899
01:00:36,208 --> 01:00:38,208
-...Have you started serving him?
-Just come over here

900
01:00:38,375 --> 01:00:39,083
Go away.

901
01:00:52,292 --> 01:00:54,375
He's going overboard.
Hey Selvam!

902
01:00:56,125 --> 01:00:59,250
Hey Selvam,
why do you trouble us like this?

903
01:00:59,750 --> 01:01:01,250
Why do you wanna sniff,
while we're on a job?

904
01:01:02,542 --> 01:01:05,292
Just listen to me. Come away.

905
01:01:05,625 --> 01:01:07,917
I can't wait without
this until Mike returns.

906
01:01:08,583 --> 01:01:09,917
Just listen. Don't take it.

907
01:01:09,958 --> 01:01:11,167
I know my limits.

908
01:01:12,083 --> 01:01:13,542
I've been watching you.

909
01:01:13,625 --> 01:01:15,083
Hey, go away.

910
01:01:16,542 --> 01:01:18,208
I must kill him.

911
01:01:18,375 --> 01:01:19,375
Don't try to stop me.

912
01:01:19,625 --> 01:01:20,375
Move.

913
01:01:24,042 --> 01:01:25,292
First shoot me
before you shoot him.

914
01:01:29,083 --> 01:01:31,125
You have got high after
getting the gun on your hands.

915
01:01:32,458 --> 01:01:34,167
Let Mike come. Wait and see.

916
01:01:50,167 --> 01:01:51,750
-There's police outside.
-Police uh?

917
01:01:53,167 --> 01:01:54,625
If you make noise,
will slit your throat.

918
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,333
Hey, Get up.

919
01:01:56,500 --> 01:01:57,333
Lift her.

920
01:01:59,083 --> 01:02:00,000
Get up.

921
01:02:01,792 --> 01:02:03,458
Go inside.

922
01:02:06,042 --> 01:02:07,917
Put them inside.

923
01:02:13,625 --> 01:02:15,500
-Hey Selvam, be careful
-Hey you come here.

924
01:02:15,667 --> 01:02:17,542
-Hey...
-You go upstairs.

925
01:02:17,958 --> 01:02:18,708
Priya!

926
01:02:34,375 --> 01:02:37,167
I don't want the cop
inside at any cost.

927
01:02:37,583 --> 01:02:42,542
If it all he does, I've no other option
than shooting everybody including him.

928
01:02:42,667 --> 01:02:44,292
Just manage the situation.

929
01:02:46,167 --> 01:02:47,625
What should I tell him?

930
01:02:48,208 --> 01:02:49,708
I don't care what
you're going to say.

931
01:02:49,833 --> 01:02:51,417
But he should not come inside.
That's all.

932
01:02:51,708 --> 01:02:53,125
If we leave him alone,
things will get complicated.

933
01:02:53,708 --> 01:02:54,792
You watch them.

934
01:03:00,667 --> 01:03:01,667
Shut up!

935
01:03:02,750 --> 01:03:04,542
I have my doubts on her

936
01:03:05,583 --> 01:03:08,708
If she creates any
problem, just kill her.

937
01:03:13,875 --> 01:03:15,458
-Who's that?
-Police, ma'am.

938
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:17,625
Sorry to trouble
you at this time.

939
01:03:18,292 --> 01:03:19,083
Tell me Sir.

940
01:03:19,083 --> 01:03:21,583
We got a call stating there's too
much noise coming from your house

941
01:03:22,083 --> 01:03:23,083
Are you alright?

942
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:25,458
Yes. I am.

943
01:03:25,583 --> 01:03:27,458
Have you seen the person
in this photograph?

944
01:03:29,833 --> 01:03:30,500
I didn't.

945
01:03:30,500 --> 01:03:31,958
He has escaped from
the police custody.

946
01:03:32,375 --> 01:03:34,125
You seem to be much terrified.

947
01:03:34,292 --> 01:03:36,333
No. No. Nothing of that sort.

948
01:03:36,833 --> 01:03:37,750
I'm alright.

949
01:03:38,750 --> 01:03:40,125
Can I have some water?

950
01:03:44,583 --> 01:03:45,458
Sure, Sir.

951
01:04:14,792 --> 01:04:17,375
Hey. Selvam. Stop it. he is a cop.
We'll get into trouble.

952
01:04:17,625 --> 01:04:18,708
Leave him.

953
01:04:19,208 --> 01:04:20,167
Move away.

954
01:04:20,292 --> 01:04:21,833
Hold him, come on hold him.

955
01:04:21,875 --> 01:04:23,792
Damn,
why did you mess with a cop?

956
01:04:23,917 --> 01:04:24,875
Crazy fellow!

957
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:27,167
It might become a serious issue.

958
01:04:33,417 --> 01:04:34,208
Lift him.

959
01:04:35,125 --> 01:04:37,292
You can answer the call later.
First lift him.

960
01:04:40,125 --> 01:04:42,208
Lift. Come on.

961
01:04:42,958 --> 01:04:44,167
Keep moving.

962
01:04:46,583 --> 01:04:48,792
Hold. Come on, lift him.

963
01:04:50,958 --> 01:04:52,167
Come on.

964
01:04:58,792 --> 01:05:00,083
First aid box?!

965
01:05:08,833 --> 01:05:10,292
What...
got scared on seeing the cop?

966
01:05:10,333 --> 01:05:11,542
Hey, shut up.

967
01:05:13,333 --> 01:05:14,750
do you want to get caught then?

968
01:05:16,042 --> 01:05:17,125
Is it the first time for me?

969
01:05:18,375 --> 01:05:20,500
If Mike comes to know of
this, you'll be in trouble.

970
01:05:20,625 --> 01:05:23,333
That's okay. Mike doesn't need
to know of this happening.

971
01:05:24,125 --> 01:05:26,167
Let's loot the money and escape.

972
01:05:26,375 --> 01:05:27,250
Get lost!

973
01:05:27,917 --> 01:05:30,708
Darling, got scared? Come on.

974
01:05:31,250 --> 01:05:32,208
Come on!

975
01:05:32,625 --> 01:05:34,542
Sir. I need to use the rest room sir.
Please sir.

976
01:05:34,875 --> 01:05:35,667
Please Sir.

977
01:05:35,958 --> 01:05:37,125
-Hey Rocket.
-Tell me, Mike

978
01:05:37,167 --> 01:05:38,083
How many times
should I tell you?

979
01:05:38,167 --> 01:05:39,167
to keep the phone on you.

980
01:05:39,417 --> 01:05:42,083
Didn't I tell I would
call you every 15 minutes?

981
01:05:42,167 --> 01:05:43,833
Restroom.
I had been to the restroom Mike.

982
01:05:44,167 --> 01:05:45,417
Keep the phone on
you all the time.

983
01:05:50,042 --> 01:05:52,708
Is there liquor at your house?

984
01:05:53,333 --> 01:05:54,625
I think there is...

985
01:05:57,375 --> 01:05:59,958
Are they boozing ?
Wait. Let me check

986
01:06:00,167 --> 01:06:02,458
Chithu. Hang up the phone.

987
01:06:04,083 --> 01:06:06,583
Only as long as they believe that we
are unaware, they will remain scared.

988
01:06:07,958 --> 01:06:08,667
So leave it.

989
01:06:10,750 --> 01:06:11,583
Aahh.

990
01:06:12,417 --> 01:06:13,542
Mugilan.

991
01:06:14,208 --> 01:06:15,125
Just wait.

992
01:06:17,333 --> 01:06:18,833
What's the problem
between you and him?

993
01:06:20,875 --> 01:06:22,833
Why did you lay your
hand on him after all?

994
01:06:26,417 --> 01:06:27,583
Sir. This is the bunk.

995
01:06:27,833 --> 01:06:30,458
Hey. This is not your money.

996
01:06:30,875 --> 01:06:33,250
If you try to act smart,

997
01:06:35,500 --> 01:06:37,167
nobody at home will be alive.

998
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:40,792
Understood?

999
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,208
Chithu. Take care of him.

1000
01:06:44,292 --> 01:06:44,833
Ok.

1001
01:06:51,792 --> 01:06:54,833
Hey hero. Undo your make up.

1002
01:07:02,708 --> 01:07:05,208
If you pull any heroic antics,
I'll kill you right away.

1003
01:07:08,167 --> 01:07:09,500
Mugilan. Mugilan.

1004
01:07:09,542 --> 01:07:11,667
Enough problems as it is,
and she's nagging on top of it.

1005
01:07:12,333 --> 01:07:13,417
What about the
police downstairs?

1006
01:07:14,917 --> 01:07:16,750
He has thrashed and
locked him in a room.

1007
01:07:17,167 --> 01:07:18,208
Such a jerk.

1008
01:07:22,208 --> 01:07:24,417
Who gave him first aid
without my permission?

1009
01:07:29,250 --> 01:07:30,125
Hey

1010
01:07:30,958 --> 01:07:32,958
I just want to kill him

1011
01:07:33,208 --> 01:07:34,792
whereas you are pampering him.

1012
01:07:35,250 --> 01:07:36,125
Huh!?

1013
01:07:36,917 --> 01:07:37,875
Tell me.

1014
01:07:42,625 --> 01:07:45,292
Look. If you don't stand by me,

1015
01:07:45,667 --> 01:07:46,792
you too are my enemy.

1016
01:07:47,667 --> 01:07:49,833
Got it?

1017
01:07:50,208 --> 01:07:51,208
Got it?!

1018
01:07:58,333 --> 01:08:01,458
Mike. Manager is not
in there at the bunk.

1019
01:08:01,875 --> 01:08:04,417
Sir. I don't know anything Sir.

1020
01:08:05,125 --> 01:08:07,958
He has left with the
money 10 minutes ago.

1021
01:08:08,792 --> 01:08:10,417
Hey, what is this?

1022
01:08:10,875 --> 01:08:11,667
Sir.

1023
01:08:12,458 --> 01:08:14,833
You know I have been
with you all this while.

1024
01:08:16,042 --> 01:08:17,958
I don't know anything Sir.
Believe me.

1025
01:08:18,958 --> 01:08:19,875
Get into the vehicle.

1026
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:21,875
Wait.

1027
01:08:22,333 --> 01:08:23,083
-Come on
-Sir

1028
01:08:23,208 --> 01:08:24,625
If we don't get the money

1029
01:08:24,708 --> 01:08:26,000
I didn't do anything.

1030
01:08:26,292 --> 01:08:27,875
Is she not your sister?

1031
01:08:28,083 --> 01:08:29,958
see what is going to happen
to your sister at home.

1032
01:08:30,375 --> 01:08:31,667
Start the vehicle.

1033
01:08:40,583 --> 01:08:41,417
Tell me Mike.

1034
01:08:42,167 --> 01:08:44,292
Rocket.
The manager is not at the bunk.

1035
01:08:44,417 --> 01:08:46,250
He has already left the
bunk with the money.

1036
01:08:46,458 --> 01:08:47,875
I think he is trying to fool us.

1037
01:08:47,917 --> 01:08:49,542
Make a conference
call with his manager.

1038
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,083
I'll do it Mike.

1039
01:08:53,542 --> 01:08:55,125
The manager is not at the bunk.

1040
01:08:55,375 --> 01:08:57,333
-Let him go
-Are you fooling us?

1041
01:08:57,375 --> 01:09:00,083
Boss just called,
are you lying to us?

1042
01:09:00,208 --> 01:09:02,583
Hey, give me the
manager's phone number.

1043
01:09:02,708 --> 01:09:03,667
Give me the phone number.

1044
01:09:03,708 --> 01:09:04,792
He must be at the bunk only.

1045
01:09:04,833 --> 01:09:06,667
Give me the phone number.
Come on.

1046
01:09:06,917 --> 01:09:07,917
-Come on
-Mugilan...

1047
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:09,083
Hey, shut up.

1048
01:09:10,333 --> 01:09:12,667
I told you we should kill him right away.
Such an ass.

1049
01:09:13,167 --> 01:09:14,333
98

1050
01:09:14,417 --> 01:09:16,083
410

1051
01:09:16,333 --> 01:09:17,667
59

1052
01:09:17,750 --> 01:09:18,667
624

1053
01:09:18,833 --> 01:09:20,417
-624
-Put it on speaker

1054
01:09:24,458 --> 01:09:26,500
Hey, speak to him.

1055
01:09:26,792 --> 01:09:28,458
Hello, Raghavan.

1056
01:09:29,458 --> 01:09:31,458
-Tell me sir.
-Where are you?

1057
01:09:32,167 --> 01:09:34,458
I'm at the ECR bunk.

1058
01:09:35,333 --> 01:09:37,375
Have you collected the
money from OMR bunk?

1059
01:09:38,292 --> 01:09:40,833
Yes sir. I'm waiting with
the money at the ECR bunk now

1060
01:09:41,167 --> 01:09:43,542
Your friends have
not come yet sir.

1061
01:09:44,083 --> 01:09:46,375
Okay. You just wait there.

1062
01:09:46,792 --> 01:09:48,250
My friends are on the way.

1063
01:09:48,750 --> 01:09:51,083
Just handover the money to them.

1064
01:09:52,333 --> 01:09:53,875
Okay sir. I'll do as you say.

1065
01:09:54,500 --> 01:09:55,667
Okay Raghavan. I will hang up.

1066
01:09:57,167 --> 01:09:58,000
Thank you sir.

1067
01:10:03,917 --> 01:10:06,792
-Darling. Come here.
-Leave me

1068
01:10:09,958 --> 01:10:10,750
Sit down.

1069
01:10:12,042 --> 01:10:13,958
-Mugilan. Mugilan.
-Hit him.

1070
01:10:14,875 --> 01:10:17,167
-Hit him I say.
-You both have already given him enough.

1071
01:10:18,708 --> 01:10:19,958
This fellow has
beaten up your buddy,

1072
01:10:20,042 --> 01:10:21,542
And you're reluctant
to hit him back

1073
01:10:21,708 --> 01:10:23,667
don't be a wuss, hit him

1074
01:10:24,750 --> 01:10:26,875
-Hit him I say.
-I won't.

1075
01:10:27,875 --> 01:10:29,000
What a moron you are!

1076
01:10:29,042 --> 01:10:30,667
-Mugilan. Mugilan
-Damn it!

1077
01:10:30,792 --> 01:10:32,792
Boss asks you to leave him.
Carry him aside.

1078
01:10:33,042 --> 01:10:34,458
You got the command
from your boss?!

1079
01:10:34,875 --> 01:10:35,917
Just do as he says.

1080
01:10:36,208 --> 01:10:38,333
Hey, shall I finish him?

1081
01:10:38,417 --> 01:10:39,250
Shall I?

1082
01:10:39,333 --> 01:10:40,625
-Come on
-Sit down!

1083
01:10:49,417 --> 01:10:50,208
Chithu.

1084
01:10:51,417 --> 01:10:52,250
You stay back.

1085
01:10:52,708 --> 01:10:54,708
-Why is it Mike?
-I'll go with him

1086
01:11:10,542 --> 01:11:12,250
His number is not reachable.

1087
01:11:12,458 --> 01:11:14,292
Sir, I'm coming
from Mugilan's house

1088
01:11:15,167 --> 01:11:16,792
He has called me
from another number

1089
01:11:16,875 --> 01:11:18,208
Let me try that.

1090
01:11:18,417 --> 01:11:21,292
-Shall I try sir?
-Give me that number. I'll call him.

1091
01:11:22,375 --> 01:11:23,833
95000

1092
01:11:24,667 --> 01:11:26,083
22603

1093
01:11:26,917 --> 01:11:27,958
Why do you need this
money, brother?

1094
01:11:28,125 --> 01:11:29,708
Sir, I'm a film director.

1095
01:11:29,917 --> 01:11:32,333
For tomorrow's shooting,
we need cash urgently

1096
01:11:32,792 --> 01:11:34,125
That's why I asked Mugilan Anna.

1097
01:11:34,250 --> 01:11:36,667
That number is
still not reachable.

1098
01:11:41,375 --> 01:11:44,000
Okay. Take the cash.
I'll inform Sir.

1099
01:11:44,375 --> 01:11:45,208
Thank you, Sir.

1100
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:58,917
Keep it Chithu.

1101
01:11:58,958 --> 01:12:00,833
Mike, hope these are
not fake currencies?

1102
01:12:08,125 --> 01:12:09,833
Hey. Stop the car.

1103
01:12:20,792 --> 01:12:22,750
Durai. We are ready to fly.

1104
01:12:22,792 --> 01:12:23,833
When do you wanna leave?

1105
01:12:24,333 --> 01:12:25,625
Can we start tomorrow?

1106
01:12:25,750 --> 01:12:26,750
Three guys, right?

1107
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,042
No. Two.

1108
01:12:37,708 --> 01:12:39,167
You said you don't smoke.

1109
01:12:46,250 --> 01:12:47,083
Take it.

1110
01:12:47,833 --> 01:12:48,750
Cool.

1111
01:12:53,125 --> 01:12:54,458
I noticed your face while
you were hitting him.

1112
01:12:54,542 --> 01:12:55,750
You didn't seemed to be nervous.

1113
01:12:57,208 --> 01:12:59,208
I come and go unnoticed
and do my job.

1114
01:12:59,708 --> 01:13:00,625
That's my style.

1115
01:13:01,458 --> 01:13:03,083
I thought you guys
had the same style

1116
01:13:03,875 --> 01:13:05,667
But here everything is wrong.

1117
01:13:07,250 --> 01:13:08,458
Shall I better go back?

1118
01:13:12,083 --> 01:13:13,417
No. If Mike comes he
would mistake you.

1119
01:13:13,667 --> 01:13:14,417
Wait for sometime.

1120
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:16,375
For how long he has
been using drugs?

1121
01:13:16,667 --> 01:13:17,917
I myself came to know just now.

1122
01:13:19,792 --> 01:13:21,417
Can't we give him
at least some water?

1123
01:13:22,208 --> 01:13:23,167
To the extent of
breaking his leg...

1124
01:13:23,333 --> 01:13:24,875
Leave it. He is high.

1125
01:13:24,958 --> 01:13:26,042
What high?

1126
01:13:26,750 --> 01:13:28,250
-If I happen to..
-What "If I.."?

1127
01:13:28,417 --> 01:13:30,208
-What "If I.."?
-Stop this nonsense

1128
01:13:30,250 --> 01:13:30,958
Go away.

1129
01:13:31,458 --> 01:13:33,250
-You should not be called Dilli.
-I said go away.

1130
01:13:33,333 --> 01:13:35,167
-You should be called silly.
-Just go!

1131
01:13:35,875 --> 01:13:38,500
I took you in to be on my
side, but you're with him now

1132
01:13:38,792 --> 01:13:40,125
Get Lost!

1133
01:13:48,167 --> 01:13:49,708
Priya, come on.

1134
01:13:50,167 --> 01:13:51,458
-Just come
-Usha. What are you doing?

1135
01:13:51,833 --> 01:13:52,917
We'll get into trouble.

1136
01:13:53,167 --> 01:13:55,708
I should blame myself
for bringing you here

1137
01:13:55,917 --> 01:13:57,792
I will wait near the lift.
You bring Mugilan.

1138
01:13:57,958 --> 01:13:59,042
Come on!

1139
01:14:00,333 --> 01:14:01,917
Hold on to me, come on.

1140
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:03,667
Can't you do even
this small job?

1141
01:14:03,750 --> 01:14:04,708
Come on sooner!

1142
01:14:05,583 --> 01:14:07,208
Keys are in my left pocket

1143
01:14:09,917 --> 01:14:11,625
-Rocket? The keys?
-You had them

1144
01:14:11,667 --> 01:14:12,625
-They are trying to escape.
-Come on

1145
01:14:12,708 --> 01:14:14,833
They are after us. Go. Go. Go.

1146
01:14:16,292 --> 01:14:18,125
Don't let them go. Catch them.

1147
01:14:20,583 --> 01:14:21,625
We have left Mugilan.

1148
01:14:21,708 --> 01:14:22,792
Don't worry.
He would manage to come.

1149
01:14:28,333 --> 01:14:29,125
Hold this.

1150
01:14:52,208 --> 01:14:54,000
Come on, hold this.

1151
01:15:21,708 --> 01:15:22,500
Hey!

1152
01:15:52,042 --> 01:15:55,042
-Damn it!
-Hey Selvam don't

1153
01:15:55,292 --> 01:15:56,292
Hey!

1154
01:15:56,833 --> 01:15:57,958
I'll take care of him.

1155
01:15:58,042 --> 01:15:59,333
You can't rely on that idiot.

1156
01:15:59,417 --> 01:16:00,917
You go down. Go!

1157
01:16:05,958 --> 01:16:07,125
Hey...!

1158
01:16:07,708 --> 01:16:08,542
Damn it!

1159
01:16:23,250 --> 01:16:23,917
Sir.

1160
01:16:25,417 --> 01:16:26,125
Sir.

1161
01:16:28,458 --> 01:16:29,167
Sir.

1162
01:16:29,917 --> 01:16:31,292
Get up sir.

1163
01:16:32,083 --> 01:16:32,958
Please sir.

1164
01:16:42,458 --> 01:16:43,167
Hey!

1165
01:16:44,542 --> 01:16:45,583
-Hey
-Hey...

1166
01:16:45,750 --> 01:16:47,083
-Where is the other one?
-She has locked herself inside.

1167
01:16:47,542 --> 01:16:49,083
-Get up, damn it -The cop
is also in that room only.

1168
01:16:49,167 --> 01:16:51,125
-Get up.
-Hey. Open the door.

1169
01:18:06,250 --> 01:18:07,667
Hey. Open the door.

1170
01:18:07,792 --> 01:18:10,208
If you don't,
I'll kill your friend.

1171
01:18:10,250 --> 01:18:11,250
Open the door.

1172
01:18:12,125 --> 01:18:13,958
Damn it!...Dilli!

1173
01:18:14,458 --> 01:18:15,792
Dilli, what happened?

1174
01:18:16,250 --> 01:18:17,208
Selvam.

1175
01:18:29,125 --> 01:18:29,750
Go.

1176
01:18:30,042 --> 01:18:30,750
Hey.

1177
01:18:31,583 --> 01:18:33,167
Sir! Sir!

1178
01:18:33,625 --> 01:18:35,500
How dare you touch a cop?
How dare?

1179
01:18:35,583 --> 01:18:36,958
How dare you touch a cop?

1180
01:18:37,042 --> 01:18:38,625
Tie his hands. Tie him.

1181
01:18:39,625 --> 01:18:42,125
Who do you think
you're messing with?

1182
01:18:42,708 --> 01:18:44,500
How dare you laid hands on me?

1183
01:18:44,542 --> 01:18:46,542
Sir, it's hurting Sir.

1184
01:18:47,083 --> 01:18:49,500
Hey, who are you? Get out I say.

1185
01:18:49,625 --> 01:18:52,250
Put down the pistol.
Hey, who are you?

1186
01:18:52,375 --> 01:18:54,083
-I didn't do anything Sir.
-Who are You ?

1187
01:18:54,458 --> 01:18:55,542
I told you to put
down the pistol.

1188
01:18:55,542 --> 01:18:56,917
Hey, you get out.

1189
01:18:57,250 --> 01:18:58,875
I said get out. Just get out.

1190
01:18:58,917 --> 01:19:00,542
Hey, you tie him too.

1191
01:19:02,458 --> 01:19:04,208
-Sir, Sir!
-Tie him.

1192
01:19:05,333 --> 01:19:07,042
Mugilan. Put that down.

1193
01:19:07,917 --> 01:19:08,792
Get lost.

1194
01:19:09,750 --> 01:19:11,708
Hey, put that pistol down.

1195
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,750
Mugilan. Sir.
He is my husband sir.

1196
01:19:16,167 --> 01:19:17,333
-Mugilan.
-Don't you hear her?

1197
01:19:17,417 --> 01:19:18,208
-Hey!
-Don't you get it?

1198
01:19:18,375 --> 01:19:19,167
I won't believe you.

1199
01:19:19,333 --> 01:19:20,167
Mugilan.
He is the one who has saved us.

1200
01:19:20,167 --> 01:19:20,833
You keep quiet.

1201
01:19:20,917 --> 01:19:21,833
Call your station.

1202
01:19:21,958 --> 01:19:23,750
Ask your people to come here.

1203
01:19:23,833 --> 01:19:24,792
Just do what he says.

1204
01:19:24,833 --> 01:19:26,000
I said keep quiet.

1205
01:19:26,583 --> 01:19:27,542
Who the hell is he?

1206
01:19:31,083 --> 01:19:33,083
-Hello. It's me.
-Mugilan. Don't.

1207
01:19:33,500 --> 01:19:34,625
I'm talking from there only.

1208
01:19:35,083 --> 01:19:36,292
Send an ambulance.

1209
01:19:36,792 --> 01:19:38,292
Also our men.

1210
01:19:38,917 --> 01:19:39,750
Alright.

1211
01:19:40,708 --> 01:19:41,542
Hang up.

1212
01:19:42,792 --> 01:19:44,208
How dare you touch you a cop?

1213
01:19:44,417 --> 01:19:46,417
Do you know the
consequences of it?

1214
01:19:46,708 --> 01:19:48,000
How dare you touch you a cop?

1215
01:19:48,167 --> 01:19:50,208
Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir...

1216
01:19:50,375 --> 01:19:52,958
Bloody rascal,
how are you touch a cop?

1217
01:19:53,667 --> 01:19:54,667
Put that down.

1218
01:19:57,708 --> 01:19:59,958
What happened?
What exactly happened?

1219
01:20:02,708 --> 01:20:03,458
Usha.

1220
01:20:04,500 --> 01:20:06,833
Me and my wife were off to
my cousin's wedding sir.

1221
01:20:07,042 --> 01:20:07,792
Get up. Usha.

1222
01:20:07,875 --> 01:20:10,042
-After that we attended a party.
-Sit down

1223
01:20:10,458 --> 01:20:14,333
There, his friend was
trying to rape a girl.

1224
01:20:14,750 --> 01:20:16,042
-Get some water
-When I questioned, he hit me.

1225
01:20:16,292 --> 01:20:17,583
So I hit him back.

1226
01:20:17,875 --> 01:20:19,083
He didn't stop with that.

1227
01:20:19,458 --> 01:20:22,500
He followed me to
my house and beat me

1228
01:20:22,708 --> 01:20:24,125
and tortured my wife.

1229
01:20:24,375 --> 01:20:26,750
She is my friend.
They attacked her too.

1230
01:20:27,458 --> 01:20:29,000
I own 2 petrol bunks.

1231
01:20:29,250 --> 01:20:31,292
They demanded the entire
collection of both the bunks.

1232
01:20:32,125 --> 01:20:34,458
Her brother Deepak.
They have taken him along with them.

1233
01:20:34,583 --> 01:20:37,875
They tortured him even
after getting all the money.

1234
01:20:38,792 --> 01:20:42,292
Okay. What about the
gun shot upstairs?

1235
01:20:43,125 --> 01:20:45,042
One of their friends kept
hitting me again and again

1236
01:20:45,208 --> 01:20:46,042
Ok.

1237
01:20:47,292 --> 01:20:48,708
So I shot him to death sir.

1238
01:20:49,292 --> 01:20:50,167
What... have you killed him?

1239
01:20:50,458 --> 01:20:51,917
Put the gun aside first.

1240
01:20:53,458 --> 01:20:54,708
Put the gun down.

1241
01:20:58,333 --> 01:21:00,083
How casually you say
that you've killed him.

1242
01:21:00,583 --> 01:21:01,333
Huh?

1243
01:21:02,250 --> 01:21:03,250
Where is the body?

1244
01:21:03,708 --> 01:21:06,125
Upstairs, there's a swimming pool
on the first floor. It is there.

1245
01:21:06,500 --> 01:21:09,500
Oh, you have a swimming
pool also here?

1246
01:21:12,958 --> 01:21:13,750
Sir?

1247
01:21:15,792 --> 01:21:17,125
what are you doing here?

1248
01:21:17,875 --> 01:21:20,750
-Usha.
-Sir, do you know Usha already?

1249
01:21:21,292 --> 01:21:24,333
Morning I went to the police
station regarding Gowri's case.

1250
01:21:25,583 --> 01:21:27,042
Whose pistol is this?

1251
01:21:27,833 --> 01:21:28,833
It is theirs.

1252
01:21:29,792 --> 01:21:30,542
Oh!

1253
01:21:31,458 --> 01:21:35,292
These guys don't seem to have
come here just to rob or kill?

1254
01:21:35,792 --> 01:21:38,583
Tell me if there is any
other personal motive?

1255
01:21:40,875 --> 01:21:43,250
Is there any other
motive behind this?

1256
01:21:44,708 --> 01:21:47,250
Do they expect
anything else from you?

1257
01:21:47,833 --> 01:21:49,833
Take your time to think.

1258
01:21:50,125 --> 01:21:51,458
"10 days ago

1259
01:21:51,750 --> 01:21:53,833
Madam gave me a file
to keep it very safe

1260
01:21:53,875 --> 01:21:55,875
so she went over to one
of her friend's house."

1261
01:22:00,458 --> 01:22:02,000
"Ya, She wanted to
use the restroom."

1262
01:22:02,292 --> 01:22:03,292
"She went to the first floor."

1263
01:22:04,792 --> 01:22:06,250
Hey Usha! Usha!

1264
01:22:06,458 --> 01:22:08,125
-Usha, where are you going?
-Hey, what happened?

1265
01:22:33,583 --> 01:22:36,458
"Nothing else could have
made me this much happy."

1266
01:22:37,833 --> 01:22:38,875
I know you too well.

1267
01:22:45,167 --> 01:22:47,125
[RINGTONE]
"Dad pick up the call"

1268
01:23:06,125 --> 01:23:08,542
He's been calling me profusely.
I'm not able to handle him

1269
01:23:08,917 --> 01:23:10,542
Shall I tell him that
we got the document?

1270
01:23:39,625 --> 01:23:40,750
Everything is okay sir.

1271
01:23:42,583 --> 01:23:44,292
The document is in
our hands now sir.

1272
01:23:48,208 --> 01:23:49,625
We can start the work sir.

1273
01:23:51,167 --> 01:23:51,833
Yes Sir.

1274
01:23:52,625 --> 01:23:54,708
Shall we ask our branding agency

1275
01:23:54,750 --> 01:23:58,083
to flash news that we need 500
workers for this new project?

1276
01:23:59,333 --> 01:24:00,000
Okay Sir.

1277
01:24:00,583 --> 01:24:01,333
Thank you sir.

1278
01:24:19,500 --> 01:24:21,875
-What happened?
-Nothing sir. I went to the washroom.

1279
01:24:27,750 --> 01:24:28,833
Pull over!

1280
01:24:38,625 --> 01:24:39,667
-Chithu.
-What is it, Mike?

1281
01:24:40,458 --> 01:24:42,333
I think there must be a
big problem at the house.

1282
01:24:43,500 --> 01:24:45,375
I've been calling for
the past half an hour

1283
01:24:45,792 --> 01:24:47,042
He is not answering the call.

1284
01:24:47,208 --> 01:24:48,667
Boss. What? What's the problem?

1285
01:24:48,833 --> 01:24:51,208
Hey, take a U turn.

1286
01:24:51,208 --> 01:24:52,958
Boss, already you have
got what you demanded.

1287
01:24:53,417 --> 01:24:54,583
What else do you want me to do?

1288
01:24:54,625 --> 01:24:55,667
Just leave me. I'll get down.

1289
01:24:55,708 --> 01:24:56,750
-Hey.
-Drive

1290
01:24:56,875 --> 01:24:58,833
Hey, I'll kill you. Turn I say.

1291
01:24:59,042 --> 01:24:59,833
Turn the vehicle.

1292
01:25:04,125 --> 01:25:06,333
Sir. You have got
what you demanded.

1293
01:25:06,542 --> 01:25:08,917
You told you would leave
once you get the money.

1294
01:25:09,042 --> 01:25:10,292
-Leave me now Sir.
-Hey!

1295
01:25:10,958 --> 01:25:11,583
don't interrupt.

1296
01:25:11,917 --> 01:25:13,583
Ask this baldy not to touch me.

1297
01:25:13,667 --> 01:25:15,583
What will you do if I touch you?

1298
01:25:15,958 --> 01:25:17,958
-Baldy!
-You stay away from this Mike.

1299
01:25:18,333 --> 01:25:20,458
-I'm gonna kill you
-Hey, watch the road.

1300
01:25:20,875 --> 01:25:22,292
Chithu, stop it.

1301
01:25:22,958 --> 01:25:24,333
Hey, I said watch the road.

1302
01:25:24,667 --> 01:25:25,958
Look at the road and drive

1303
01:25:26,208 --> 01:25:27,333
Damn it!

1304
01:25:27,958 --> 01:25:29,375
How dare you touch me?

1305
01:25:32,542 --> 01:25:33,833
Hey, drive straight.

1306
01:25:33,958 --> 01:25:35,958
Right side. Right side. Right side.

1307
01:25:40,292 --> 01:25:42,167
Hey, are you guys ok?

1308
01:25:43,375 --> 01:25:45,333
Why do you look panicked?

1309
01:25:51,833 --> 01:25:53,375
What are you searching for?

1310
01:26:10,167 --> 01:26:11,708
It will be over in 10 minutes.

1311
01:26:13,042 --> 01:26:14,458
I will call once
I'm done with it.

1312
01:26:18,208 --> 01:26:19,000

1313
01:26:20,208 --> 01:26:21,083

1318
01:26:49,042 --> 01:26:50,750

He's going to put
that blame on us.

1349
01:28:16,417 --> 01:28:17,333
We should not get caught.

1350

Akka, open the door please.

1420
01:33:33,167 --> 01:33:34,208
Akka!

1421
01:33:34,583 --> 01:33:36,458
Aaah! Sir!

1422
01:33:36,625 --> 01:33:37,292
Aaah!

1423
01:33:37,333 --> 01:33:39,458
Are you going to open the door
or shall I kill your brother?

1424
01:33:40,375 --> 01:33:42,708
Hey, open the door.

1425
01:33:45,042 --> 01:33:47,583
-Sir, it's hurting
-If I don't get the document

1426
01:33:47,667 --> 01:33:48,792
you won't see your
brother alive again.

1427
01:33:48,833 --> 01:33:50,583
Sir, I never did anything.

1428
01:33:50,792 --> 01:33:52,417
Sir, it's very painful sir.

1429
01:33:52,542 --> 01:33:54,333
I said, open the door.

1430
01:33:56,500 --> 01:33:57,458
Sir.

1431
01:33:58,500 --> 01:33:59,250
Sir.

1432
01:34:00,500 --> 01:34:02,958
-He'll die
-It's hurting, Sir.

1433
01:34:03,042 --> 01:34:04,875
You're gonna lose your brother.

1434
01:34:07,208 --> 01:34:08,458
Leave me sir.

1435
01:34:08,625 --> 01:34:11,917
Open the door.
Otherwise he will die just like Gowri.

1436
01:34:12,083 --> 01:34:12,917
Hey.

1437
01:34:19,625 --> 01:34:21,417
Hey, let go off me.

1438
01:34:29,542 --> 01:34:31,208
Hey. Hey Deepak.

1439
01:35:11,917 --> 01:35:12,917
Go to hell.

1440
01:35:51,917 --> 01:35:52,833
Mugilan.

1441
01:36:24,417 --> 01:36:27,167
Last night at the
residence of Mannarmannar

1442
01:36:27,208 --> 01:36:29,208
an unidentified gang
attempted a burglary

1443
01:36:29,375 --> 01:36:33,000
his son Mugilan was
murdered during that process

1444
01:36:33,167 --> 01:36:35,250
They found 3 more
dead bodies out there

1445
01:36:35,500 --> 01:36:40,208
we came to know,
one among that was an Police Officer Guru.

1446
01:36:40,500 --> 01:36:43,708
This incident has created
a panic among the people.

1447
01:36:44,542 --> 01:36:46,708
In accordance to Gowri's murder
and Kodaikannal fire accident

1448
01:36:46,792 --> 01:36:49,333
Chennai High Court has
issued an sensational verdict

1449
01:36:49,375 --> 01:36:51,750
Tamilnadu Govt. As per the
verdict passed by the High Court

1450
01:36:51,917 --> 01:36:54,500
should stop the Advait Constructions
from constructing in Kodaikannal

1451
01:36:54,625 --> 01:36:57,000
also ask them to vacate
that area of mountains.

1452
01:36:57,375 --> 01:36:59,542
[Reporter] There has been a setback
for Advaita Group of companies

1453
01:36:59,625 --> 01:37:01,875
as TN Govt. has asked them
to evacuate from Tamilnadu

1454
01:37:01,958 --> 01:37:06,208
But the company has claimed that there's
no scam in acquiring the said land.

1455
01:37:06,333 --> 01:37:09,583
And it applies to NGT to allow
their operations in Kodaikannal.

1456
01:37:10,208 --> 01:37:11,375
[Interviewer] Vanakkam Usha.

1457
01:37:11,583 --> 01:37:13,833
First of all,
we congratulate you for this victory.

1458
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,667
What do you feel
about this success?

1459
01:37:17,542 --> 01:37:19,375
This is the struggle
of the tribes.

1460
01:37:19,917 --> 01:37:21,167
And this victory is
achieved by Gowri.

1461
01:37:21,792 --> 01:37:24,167
I'm just a tool in this.

1462
01:37:24,958 --> 01:37:27,958
Generally why do people like you are
always against any change or development ?

1463
01:37:28,583 --> 01:37:29,458
What do you mean by
change or development?

1464
01:37:29,917 --> 01:37:32,708
The foreign corporates make millions

1465
01:37:32,792 --> 01:37:35,125
in the name of offering
jobs to our people,

1466
01:37:35,250 --> 01:37:37,458
and by exploiting our people's
land, labor and water

1467
01:37:37,583 --> 01:37:39,250
this can't be called a
change or development.

1468
01:37:39,458 --> 01:37:40,917
We don't need such changes.

1469
01:37:41,042 --> 01:37:43,500
This happens not only in
India but all over the world.

1470
01:37:44,792 --> 01:37:46,333
According to the
Global Witness Report

1471
01:37:46,583 --> 01:37:51,292
in 2018, 27 countries including
India, 317 people have been killed.

1472
01:37:51,542 --> 01:37:54,917
70 percent of the victims are
environmental activists and journalists.

1473
01:37:55,542 --> 01:37:58,792
The only aim of the activists
who lost their lives was that,

1474
01:37:59,333 --> 01:38:03,250
a country's resources must be
used by and for it's own people.

1475
01:38:03,708 --> 01:38:05,875
The corporate companies
that exploit us

1476
01:38:05,917 --> 01:38:07,583
and the politicians
who support them

1477
01:38:07,708 --> 01:38:10,708
Protesting is the only weapon
we have to defend ourselves.

1478
01:39:33,333 --> 01:39:33,875
