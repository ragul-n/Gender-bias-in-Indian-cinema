Is there no other youths in this village?

44
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:48,376
Why do they all see and expect you.

45
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:54,037
You / Relax.

46
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:59,739
He opened the flow of water from the river to the bother and drain the rice fields.

47
00:06:59,856 --> 00:07:02,572
When to plant crops planted ,when harvested

49
00:07:03,743 --> 00:07:05,749
without asking Sarman

50
00:07:05,749 --> 00:07:07,715
the sun would not rising.

51
00:07:07,715 --> 00:07:08,902
You are.

52
00:07:08,902 --> 00:07:12,015
He did a good job even you scold him..

53
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:14,624
Aunt, if I could help someone else why should I be silent?

54
00:07:15,901 --> 00:07:17,533
Today I feel anxious.

55
00:07:17,533 --> 00:07:21,233
thinking about you and that crocodile ..

56
00:07:22,574 --> 00:07:24,368
You stop thinking of me Auntie.

57
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,348
Aunty.

58
00:08:21,348 --> 00:08:23,665
You're always singing, what songs is that ?.

59
00:08:23,665 --> 00:08:26,424
The song is not from among us.

60
00:08:31,614 --> 00:08:33,185
Aunty.

61
00:08:34,409 --> 00:08:36,670
Have you ever seen a horned animals?

62
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:38,635
Like a gazelle

63
00:08:38,635 --> 00:08:40,714
on his head is a long horn.

64
00:08:42,829 --> 00:08:44,852
Why do you ask?

65
00:08:44,852 --> 00:08:46,496
He always comes into my dreams.

66
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,539
It was just a dream.

67
00:08:49,539 --> 00:08:51,423
Now go away.

68
00:08:51,423 --> 00:08:53,004
Your uncle is waiting in the fields.

69
00:09:05,292 --> 00:09:07,626
This time our crops decreased, Sarman.

70
00:09:08,945 --> 00:09:13,367
River flow changed direction.

71
00:09:13,367 --> 00:09:16,604
and the water flow is not flowing into our village.

72
00:09:16,604 --> 00:09:19,243
how this could be fertile ground without water.

73
00:09:19,243 --> 00:09:20,388
Uncle.

74
00:09:20,388 --> 00:09:22,199
Should I ask something?

75
00:09:23,939 --> 00:09:25,440
Mohenjo Daro

76
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,470
All people want to go there.

77
00:09:28,031 --> 00:09:29,712
This time let me get there.

78
00:09:29,712 --> 00:09:33,209
For three years just the same question.

79
00:09:33,209 --> 00:09:35,086
I was tired of hearing it.

80
00:09:35,086 --> 00:09:36,396
Do you not get tired of asking the same thing?

81
00:09:36,396 --> 00:09:38,669
As long as you do not allow me to get there then I would always ask.

82
00:09:39,915 --> 00:09:41,836
Uncle, I want to travel around the world.

83
00:09:41,836 --> 00:09:43,726
From where the sun rises?

84
00:09:43,726 --> 00:09:45,515
And where the sun sets?

85
00:09:45,515 --> 00:09:48,051
Where water resources?

86
00:09:48,051 --> 00:09:50,192
I want to see it all, uncle ,.

87
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:54,925
A bird not prematurely going away from the nest.

88
00:09:54,925 --> 00:09:57,214
can not be destroyed, Sarman.

89
00:10:01,126 --> 00:10:08,655
Barathi Music Medan

90
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,104
Sarman, come and eat.

91
00:10:13,468 --> 00:10:14,426
What is going wrong ?

92
00:10:15,131 --> 00:10:17,541
He yearns to go to Mohenjo Daro.

93
00:10:18,158 --> 00:10:19,814
I forbid it, he got angry and left.

94
00:10:21,607 --> 00:10:23,878
Anger will not be long.

95
00:10:23,878 --> 00:10:25,749
In a short time will be lost.

96
00:10:26,844 --> 00:10:27,904
However.

97
00:10:28,953 --> 00:10:30,852
Until when we are going to ban it there.

98
00:10:30,852 --> 00:10:33,146
While we still can.

99
00:10:33,817 --> 00:10:37,090
He asked about an animal.

100
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:44,255
I do not understand what's going on Mohnejo Daro?

101
00:10:44,255 --> 00:10:45,893
where my uncle forbade me to get there.

102
00:10:45,893 --> 00:10:48,976
He was afraid, if you go there you will stay there forever.

103
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:56,008
you do not want to see it.

104
00:10:56,008 --> 00:10:58,285
What

105
00:10:58,285 --> 00:11:00,142
What other circumstances beyond earth?

106
00:11:01,047 --> 00:11:02,800
how many humans there?

107
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,736
what about the women there?

108
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:09,895
Nowadays you do not like the women here.

109
00:11:10,231 --> 00:11:12,369
Are women in Mohenjo Daro use the horn gem.

110
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:15,305
I do not know.

111
00:11:15,305 --> 00:11:16,428
But my heart says.

112
00:11:16,428 --> 00:11:19,307
couples defeat me

113
00:11:19,307 --> 00:11:22,697
will not be second to none in this world.

114
00:11:22,697 --> 00:11:25,639
If so you're not going to be met with a partner.

115
00:11:27,424 --> 00:11:29,359
Everything always happens like this.

116
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:32,712
You do not think there, you forget it, Sarman.

117
00:11:34,023 --> 00:11:36,364
But I have to go to Mohenjo Daro

118
00:11:36,849 --> 00:11:39,255
Are you going to fly like a bird going to Mohenjo Daro.

119
00:11:50,597 --> 00:11:51,531
What, what / Shhhhh

120
00:11:51,531 --> 00:11:53,257
What is wrong ?

121
00:11:53,257 --> 00:11:54,988
The sun will rise

122
00:11:54,988 --> 00:11:56,555
We must leave.

123
00:11:56,555 --> 00:11:57,827
where?

124
00:11:57,827 --> 00:11:59,774
To Mohenjo daro.

125
00:12:00,141 --> 00:12:01,729
Mohenjo, you're crazy.

126
00:12:01,729 --> 00:12:04,928
If Uncle and Aunt get know.

127
00:12:04,928 --> 00:12:07,578
Let's go..

128
00:12:23,029 --> 00:12:25,537
The trip to Mohenjo Daro was not very easy, Sarman ..

129
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:29,936
I'll give you listen with well briefed.

130
00:12:29,936 --> 00:12:31,445
say, Uncle.

131
00:12:31,445 --> 00:12:34,172
Whatever it is, do not drop the price,

132
00:12:34,664 --> 00:12:37,832
Mohenjo daro different from us.

133
00:12:38,965 --> 00:12:42,257
there is not a human who live but humans are greedy who live there.

134
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:46,025
You always have to be careful.

135
00:12:46,025 --> 00:12:48,560
and do not consider anyone to be your friend.

136
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,281
You do not worry, Kaka

137
00:12:50,281 --> 00:12:52,790
I was always together with Sarman.

138
00:12:56,339 --> 00:12:58,508
Chief

139
00:12:58,511 --> 00:13:01,213
You've always conduct transactions

140
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:03,170
This time Sarman departing.

141
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:05,247
I can not forbid it.

142
00:13:05,247 --> 00:13:07,872
Please keep him well / Okay.

143
00:13:08,715 --> 00:13:10,105
These foods for you.

144
00:13:11,489 --> 00:13:13,148
take care of yourself.

145
00:13:13,148 --> 00:13:15,451
Let's go.

146
00:13:15,451 --> 00:13:18,583
Whether the goods already loaded?

147
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:56,730
You keep it with you.

148
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:59,243
If you're having problems

149
00:13:59,243 --> 00:14:02,683
You can open it, you promised.

150
00:14:43,498 --> 00:14:44,597
Yes.

151
00:15:07,959 --> 00:15:09,350
Mohenjo Daro.

152
00:15:32,169 --> 00:15:34,399
and this is our sacred river called Sindhu.

153
00:15:50,796 --> 00:15:55,997

How can they make it ..

It was a sign , Uncle.

157
00:16:09,655 --> 00:16:13,732
This marks the residents in the Sindhu area, son.

158
00:16:14,077 --> 00:16:16,613
Each line in the form of a sign of a region.

159
00:16:17,091 --> 00:16:19,637
That region which, horned one.

160
00:16:19,637 --> 00:16:24,163
It is an animal that is respected in the Sindhu.

161
00:16:24,163 --> 00:16:26,329
Signs of Mohenjo daro 

162
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:46,452
The seller, enter into and take your merchandise card ..

163

00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:08,651
Take it.

165
00:17:10,664 --> 00:17:11,681
thank you

166
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:22,039
Why did you come here?

167
00:17:22,039 --> 00:17:25,347
You should go home?

168
00:17:25,347 --> 00:17:27,441
Listen to me.

169
00:17:27,441 --> 00:17:30,835
These regions are greedy.

170
00:17:30,835 --> 00:17:33,897
This earth for not people like you.

171
00:17:35,337 --> 00:17:37,318
Save your life.

172
00:17:37,318 --> 00:17:39,173
Otherwise, you will burn

173
00:17:39,173 --> 00:17:40,686
Go home.

174
00:17:42,948 --> 00:17:44,481
You must not interfere with people walking.

175
00:17:44,481 --> 00:17:47,363
Go home.

176
00:17:57,403 --> 00:18:00,762
Go ..

177
00:18:18,089 --> 00:18:18,864
Who is he?

178
00:18:18,864 --> 00:18:21,015
his name  is Jakiro

179
00:18:21,015 --> 00:18:24,904
Pity about him, people call him crazy.

180
00:18:24,904 --> 00:18:28,678
but his family that makes this country.

181
00:18:28,464 --> 00:18:31,534
and he was once also lived happily.

182
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:45,321
sarman.

183
00:18:45,321 --> 00:18:46,903
On top of the house there is a house

184
00:18:47,392 --> 00:18:48,937
I've not seen this before.

185
00:18:48,937 --> 00:18:50,489
I do not understand.

186
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:53,410
But certainly.

187
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:56,289
I think that ever before, I see the same.

188
00:18:57,408 --> 00:18:58,903
I also feel the same, Sarman

189
00:18:58,903 --> 00:19:01,123

Good deals.

273
00:23:56,418 --> 00:23:59,417
Here transaction occurs that I want.

how can I be silent?

294
00:25:19,141 --> 00:25:22,317
The transaction is not done like this way, to be honest.

295
00:25:22,317 --> 00:25:24,346
They work for their stomachs.

296
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:27,664
Uncle say truth.

Let it go, CHANNI

You're not listening.

316
00:27:02,927 --> 00:27:05,272
Say sorry

317
00:27:08,373 --> 00:27:09,385

00:27:25,493 --> 00:27:27,154

00:27:27,154 --> 00:27:29,260
he seems a stranger.

325
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:31,847
Let's apologize to her.

326
00:27:31,847 --> 00:27:35,408

00:31:03,823 --> 00:31:08,185
Tyranny of you have traveled by the people here.

377
00:31:08,185 --> 00:31:13,359
and Mukjan will fight all the oppressed.

378
00:31:13,894 --> 00:31:17,622
You're silent, because you do not know the story of MAHAM truth ..

379
00:31:17,583 --> 00:31:20,477
why he tried to destroy hadapa?

380
00:31:20,477 --> 00:31:23,545
Simply, man ungrateful.

381
00:31:23,545 --> 00:31:25,269
Remember.

382
00:31:25,683 --> 00:31:29,395
only one rule that is done by Maham.

383
00:31:30,488 --> 00:31:34,815
who participated in this case, please lifted his hands ..

384
00:31:34,815 --> 00:31:36,651
against ..

385
00:31:36,651 --> 00:31:38,192
Show me your hands stout.

386
00:31:58,294 --> 00:32:00,022
I refused.

387
00:32:00,597 --> 00:32:04,254
The house will be enlarged

388
00:32:04,254 --> 00:32:07,153
The decision has been taken.

389
00:32:15,087 --> 00:32:16,369
Leaders of farmers ..

390
00:32:16,369 --> 00:32:20,016
Conversation is not over.

391
00:32:28,922 --> 00:32:32,821
Say no more, Your Honor.

392
00:32:32,821 --> 00:32:35,016
What do you know.

393
00:32:35,016 --> 00:32:37,987
where others do not know about it ...

394
00:32:38,479 --> 00:32:43,557
Because of you against future destruction.

395
00:32:46,192 --> 00:32:48,348
it is intended for all representatives who were in this place.

396
00:32:48,348 --> 00:32:51,006
in which the seller of goods

397
00:32:50,913 --> 00:32:53,143
without the permission of this majesty.

398
00:32:53,143 --> 00:32:57,971
can not run their business.

399
00:32:58,008 --> 00:32:59,518
and as feedback, what can we received ..

400
00:32:59,518 --> 00:33:03,914
All sellers must sell goods at Harappa.

401
00:33:24,599 --> 00:33:26,487
Today, I've decided ..

402
00:33:26,487 --> 00:33:29,164
I will avenge my humiliation ..

403
00:33:29,164 --> 00:33:31,032
dan harappa

404
00:33:31,032 --> 00:33:32,660

405
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:34,657
You can create what ..aakhh ...

406
00:33:48,219 --> 00:33:51,780
I'm the only authority in Mohenjo Daro

407
00:33:52,115 --> 00:33:55,937
and I also decide who should live and die

408
00:33:56,421 --> 00:33:57,949
and you will not live ..

409
00:34:02,262 --> 00:34:05,844
If you die, then you would not bring your friends.

410
00:34:10,112 --> 00:34:12,584
Now... you can no longer do the revolt.

411
00:34:12,584 --> 00:34:15,828
everywhere.

412
00:34:22,192 --> 00:34:23,111
No, sir

413
00:34:42,083 --> 00:34:43,333
Attention, please..

414
00:34:43,333 --> 00:34:46,445
The song can begin ..

415
00:34:46,445 --> 00:34:52,652
Barathi Music Medan

416
00:35:14,472 --> 00:35:18,697
Mohenjo, Mohenjo, Mohenjo, Mohenjo Daro

417
00:35:30,779 --> 00:35:34,354
Mohenjo, Mohenjo, Mohenjo, Mohenjo Daro

418
00:41:49,475 --> 00:41:53,922
Lottar, The house of priest being there

419
00:41:53,922 --> 00:41:54,920
Yes.

420
00:41:56,205 --> 00:41:58,219
Can you take me there?

421
00:41:58,219 --> 00:41:59,408
No, Sarman

422
00:41:59,408 --> 00:42:01,722
Foreigners are not allowed to go in there.

423
00:42:01,722 --> 00:42:03,782
They have a sign.

424
00:42:03,782 --> 00:42:06,304
only those who obtain permission to go in there.

425
00:42:09,811 --> 00:42:11,036
This sign can be.

426
00:42:14,507 --> 00:42:16,146
Where did you get this mark?

427
00:42:16,146 --> 00:42:17,576
What are you doing, Sarman?

428
00:42:17,576 --> 00:42:19,121
Do you remember the explanation of the uncle.

429
00:42:19,121 --> 00:42:20,515
If the newly released emergency signs.

430
00:42:20,515 --> 00:42:22,607
It is also a state of emergency, a friend.

431
00:42:22,607 --> 00:42:24,459
I had to look it up.

432
00:42:26,882 --> 00:42:29,451
You have to act like the people in this Uchinagar.

433
00:42:56,503 --> 00:42:57,991
Why so long?

434
00:42:57,991 --> 00:43:00,467
Yes, please..

435
00:43:15,485 --> 00:43:17,895
I felt like we were in a different city.

436
00:43:29,445 --> 00:43:30,604
See.

437
00:43:35,205 --> 00:43:37,623
Dressed in yellow was her father.

438
00:43:37,958 --> 00:43:39,518
was a priest.

439
00:43:45,545 --> 00:43:48,462
You're happy, your heart is already happy.

440
00:43:48,462 --> 00:43:49,515
So we go home now.

441
00:44:23,805 --> 00:44:37,819
Barathi Music Medan

442
00:45:08,904 --> 00:45:10,795
Look into my eyes.

443
00:45:10,795 --> 00:45:18,337
Look into my eyes ..

444
00:46:05,187 --> 00:46:06,779
Thank you very much.

445
00:46:08,650 --> 00:46:09,988
Who are you ?

446
00:46:11,552 --> 00:46:12,884
My daughter, you're alright.

447
00:46:13,956 --> 00:46:15,747
Thank you.

448
00:46:15,747 --> 00:46:17,562
You've saved my daughter.

449
00:46:17,562 --> 00:46:19,681
You save with patience.

450
00:46:19,681 --> 00:46:20,859
What is your name ?

451
00:46:20,859 --> 00:46:22,814
You're not a resident here.

452
00:46:22,814 --> 00:46:24,443
My name is Sarman.

453
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:27,713
I'm a farmer.

454
00:46:27,713 --> 00:46:30,294
I come from Amrik

455
00:46:40,662 --> 00:46:44,213
Your arrival means here is the desire of Mother. Sindhu.

456
00:47:03,199 --> 00:47:04,473
Do not look back, now.

457
00:47:04,473 --> 00:47:05,613
Why do you have to look back?

458
00:47:06,196 --> 00:47:08,161
But she would look back.

459
00:47:08,161 --> 00:47:11,842
She was the daughter of Mohenjo Daro, and you're an ordinary farmer of Amrik

460
00:47:12,089 --> 00:47:14,504
If the sun and moon are united, he will look back.

461
00:47:26,701 --> 00:47:28,195
An amazing country.

462
00:47:28,195 --> 00:47:30,322
Here the moon and the sun can not be entrusted.

463
00:48:34,104 --> 00:48:35,261
this animal.

464
00:48:38,198 --> 00:48:39,062
Yes

465
00:48:39,062 --> 00:48:41,462
The vehicle of Mother Sindhu.

466
00:48:41,462 --> 00:48:45,841
With this vehicle Mother Sindhu surrounds the entire planet.

467
00:48:45,841 --> 00:48:48,504
People now know him by the name of Lion Mathur.

468
00:48:48,514 --> 00:48:50,779
But for those who see Singha

469
00:48:51,241 --> 00:48:53,141
They feel blessed.

470
00:48:53,141 --> 00:48:55,702
These animals always come into my dream.

471
00:48:57,161 --> 00:48:58,882
Standing on the banks of the river ..

472
00:48:58,882 --> 00:49:02,802
like ... he's waiting for me ...

473
00:49:06,767 --> 00:49:07,944
and this sign.

474
00:49:07,944 --> 00:49:09,792
what does it mean, priest?

475
00:49:09,792 --> 00:49:12,532
This Singha / -  this sign, where did you get?

476
00:49:12,532 --> 00:49:14,405
My uncle gave me.

477
00:49:14,405 --> 00:49:16,146
To protect myself.

478
00:49:17,875 --> 00:49:19,134
Your uncle.

479
00:49:20,779 --> 00:49:21,955
What is his name ?

480
00:49:24,352 --> 00:49:25,821
and where your father?

481
00:49:26,983 --> 00:49:33,025
They've left me.

482
00:49:33,025 --> 00:49:35,294
20 years back.

483
00:49:40,822 --> 00:49:42,940
Put there.

484
00:50:34,540 --> 00:50:35,524
Lottar ..

485
00:50:35,524 --> 00:50:38,281
It seems there is an incident?

486
00:51:07,659 --> 00:51:09,137
Leaders of farmers

487
00:51:09,137 --> 00:51:10,383
and his friends

488
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:14,699
Who killed them?

489
00:51:16,261 --> 00:51:17,275
Maham did this.

490
00:51:18,953 --> 00:51:19,807
Why ?

491
00:51:19,807 --> 00:51:21,551
They rebel.

492
00:51:21,551 --> 00:51:25,292
All guilty.

493
00:51:32,361 --> 00:51:36,532
All guilty ... all guilty.

494
00:51:36,532 --> 00:51:37,776
What a mistake that they do?

495
00:51:38,569 --> 00:51:39,836
He named as Lakho.

496
00:51:39,836 --> 00:51:41,947
He made a mistake.

497
00:51:41,947 --> 00:51:43,747
Day.

498
00:51:44,068 --> 00:51:44,945
Samhi.

499
00:51:44,945 --> 00:51:46,729
He asked for justice.

500
00:51:46,729 --> 00:51:47,897
Make a mistake.

501
00:51:47,897 --> 00:51:49,343
I also.

502
00:51:49,343 --> 00:51:52,098
I say to the rest of Mohenjo Daro.

503
00:51:52,098 --> 00:51:54,425
maham

504
00:51:54,812 --> 00:51:57,212
rid of me, and pulled me out of the palace.

505
00:51:59,547 --> 00:52:01,245
Now had no voice anymore.

506
00:52:02,188 --> 00:52:04,182
Why are they in this situation?

507
00:52:04,182 --> 00:52:06,908
Why did they not cremated?

508
00:52:06,908 --> 00:52:08,312
Not allowed

509
00:52:08,312 --> 00:52:10,426
to be burned

510
00:52:10,426 --> 00:52:12,499
or buried.

511
00:52:13,695 --> 00:52:15,548
and how they are treated.

512
00:52:15,548 --> 00:52:17,561
then the next solar will be completed.

513
00:52:26,125 --> 00:52:27,748
Humans are treated as animals

514
00:52:27,748 --> 00:52:29,044
I had never seen before.

515
00:52:29,044 --> 00:52:31,539
I've killed a crocodile.

516
00:52:32,669 --> 00:52:34,716
but the treatment is so for humans.

517
00:52:35,658 --> 00:52:38,021
I've never seen and heard, Lottar

518
00:52:40,064 --> 00:52:41,657
You also see that and just silence.

519
00:52:41,657 --> 00:52:42,922
You do not do anything.

520
00:52:44,512 --> 00:52:45,815
I can not do that.

521
00:52:46,894 --> 00:52:50,435
You're a guard Lottar.

522
00:52:50,435 --> 00:52:53,925
how can you be silent about all this?

523
00:52:55,698 --> 00:52:57,345
I couldn't Sarman ,.

524
00:53:03,975 --> 00:53:06,104
I have relationship with the city.,

525
00:53:07,324 --> 00:53:10,483
if not why animals singha come always in my dreams ..

526
00:53:12,654 --> 00:53:15,056
Why uncle Durjan still keep the mark ..

527
00:53:16,012 --> 00:53:18,058
which is solely owned by locals.

528
00:53:21,830 --> 00:53:23,499
The introduction of this city ..

529
00:53:23,499 --> 00:53:25,768
why like mine before ..

530
00:53:29,971 --> 00:53:31,784
When all the questions have not been answered.

531
00:53:33,469 --> 00:53:35,431
I'm not going to go from here.

532
00:53:45,445 --> 00:53:46,946
Attention ...

533
00:53:48,561 --> 00:53:51,939
Please listen all...

534
00:53:51,939 --> 00:53:54,794
The whole of the Mohenjo Daro comphrehend ..

535
00:53:54,794 --> 00:53:57,619
with backflow conducted Indus

536
00:53:57,619 --> 00:54:00,272
have destructed Neechnagar

537
00:54:01,576 --> 00:54:02,871
therefore..

538
00:54:02,871 --> 00:54:04,444
Maham, the great

539
00:54:04,444 --> 00:54:06,289
ask the people of Mohenjo Daro.

540
00:54:06,651 --> 00:54:08,321
requesting payment of taxes.

541
00:54:08,321 --> 00:54:10,026
Where else could I give?

542
00:54:10,026 --> 00:54:13,306
The remaining also I would feed to my children.

543
00:54:13,306 --> 00:54:15,704
or I put these criminals on foot.

544
00:54:15,974 --> 00:54:17,533
We do not need help Maham

545
00:54:17,533 --> 00:54:18,951
we've had enough.

546
00:54:18,951 --> 00:54:21,244
But we do not have any other path.

547
00:54:21,244 --> 00:54:23,995
If you do not follow the rules of Maham and you'll be hanged alive.

548
00:54:28,528 --> 00:54:29,929
Controller of Maham.

549
00:54:29,929 --> 00:54:31,124
hear me out.

550
00:54:32,243 --> 00:54:34,231
Give the message to Maham.

551
00:54:34,231 --> 00:54:36,655
Residents here will not pay taxes.

552
00:54:36,655 --> 00:54:38,652
Who are you ?

553
00:54:39,883 --> 00:54:41,375
Tell Maham.

554
00:54:42,219 --> 00:54:44,362
Mohenjo Daro population will not follow the rules.

555
00:54:44,362 --> 00:54:46,378
Foolish youth.

556
00:54:46,378 --> 00:54:49,340
If you fight with Maham ..

557
00:54:49,340 --> 00:54:50,425
then sentence him to death.

558
00:54:50,425 --> 00:54:51,446
Dead.

559
00:54:51,446 --> 00:54:53,746
and also follow the rules, will death as well ..

560
00:54:55,027 --> 00:54:56,686
My children will die.

561
00:54:56,686 --> 00:54:58,589
My family would die.

562
00:55:00,095 --> 00:55:02,306
Better than I saw children die.

563
00:55:02,306 --> 00:55:05,730
Better to die in the hands of Maham

564
00:55:05,730 --> 00:55:07,824
Anyone who supports me?

565
00:55:07,824 --> 00:55:09,659
Yes, he spoke the truth.

566
00:55:09,659 --> 00:55:12,117
Yes he is telling the truth / I would not be paying taxes.

567
00:55:12,117 --> 00:55:16,496
Yes, we also do not want.

568
00:55:19,581 --> 00:55:20,499
Wait.

569
00:55:39,212 --> 00:55:41,383
I've never seen him.

570
00:55:41,383 --> 00:55:44,644
Incident has never happened like this before.

571
00:55:44,644 --> 00:55:47,756
how could this happen ?

572
00:55:49,019 --> 00:55:50,586
searching and find out

573
00:55:50,586 --> 00:55:52,121
Who's the boy?

574
00:55:52,121 --> 00:55:53,598
Right now.

575
00:56:12,273 --> 00:56:13,265
Naani.

576
00:56:13,265 --> 00:56:14,917
You should not be here.

577
00:56:14,917 --> 00:56:17,837
I wooried if anyone recognized you.

578
00:56:17,837 --> 00:56:19,157
there will be a problem.

579
00:56:22,089 --> 00:56:23,774
They see it.

580
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:33,311
Nobody can recognized me /Look over there.

581
00:56:33,311 --> 00:56:35,342
He will recognized you.

582
00:56:35,342 --> 00:56:37,070
Now you're silent.

583
00:56:37,070 --> 00:56:38,606
Let us look for her.

584
00:56:39,970 --> 00:56:41,983
If he did not recognize you, then this is great.

585
00:56:43,253 --> 00:56:44,081
Come on.

586
00:56:52,725 --> 00:56:54,165
This is better, Sarman.

588
00:57:04,072 --> 00:57:05,655

Laugh?

590
00:57:08,628 --> 00:57:09,622
He did not laugh.

591
00:57:17,144 --> 00:57:19,260
All the girls in this town like you.

592
00:57:31,591 --> 00:57:33,801
you just looked at each other or did not speak.

593
00:57:33,801 --> 00:57:35,390
sarman.

594
00:57:35,641 --> 00:57:37,733
goat has been selected and the others ...

595
00:57:47,597 --> 00:57:48,527
Naani

596
00:57:48,527 --> 00:57:52,738
you stand out in the crowd, anything can happen. / Wait a minute.

597
00:58:07,126 --> 00:58:08,388
The whistle of the land.

598
00:58:08,388 --> 00:58:10,121
I made them.

599
00:58:17,295 --> 00:58:20,773
Today you do not use the crown, but I still recognize you.

600
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:23,276
I want to meet you.

601
00:58:24,611 --> 00:58:26,142
you wanted to meet with me.

602
00:58:29,813 --> 00:58:31,406
Without your crown, you look more beautiful.

603
00:58:37,277 --> 00:58:38,178
You know.

604
00:58:38,178 --> 00:58:41,158
When I opened my crown, I felt something different.

605
00:58:41,158 --> 00:58:43,753
In this dress, I felt no one would recognize me.

606
00:58:43,753 --> 00:58:46,531
and they also do not give honor to me

607
00:58:47,016 --> 00:58:50,134
and here too I do not need to give a blessing and save others as well.

608
00:58:51,697 --> 00:58:53,782
I can do all as I please.

609
00:58:55,551 --> 00:58:57,772
and do you know why this happens?

610
00:58:57,772 --> 00:58:58,926
Why ?

611
00:58:59,923 --> 00:59:01,423
because of you.

612
00:59:02,691 --> 00:59:03,639
Because of me.

613
00:59:03,639 --> 00:59:04,717
Yes, right.

614
00:59:04,717 --> 00:59:07,584
If I had not met you ..

615
00:59:07,584 --> 00:59:09,654

616
00:59:15,907 --> 00:59:17,392

legalized its use in this region.

626
01:00:15,843 --> 01:00:17,484
Who are the rebels?

627
01:00:18,452 --> 01:00:21,788
Who dare to fight with me rule.

628
01:00:21,788 --> 01:00:23,720
I could not recognize him until now, Your Majesty

629
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:25,772
but I have other news.

630
01:00:25,772 --> 01:00:29,378

648
01:01:24,388 --> 01:01:25,413
Is it true.

649
01:01:26,577 --> 01:01:28,347
So, tonight I have to meet her.

650
01:01:28,362 --> 01:01:30,283

651
01:01:30,283 --> 01:01:32,329

652
01:01:32,329 --> 01:01:33,735

my sea ship docked and waiting for goods from you.

669
01:03:14,079 --> 01:03:16,672
How much longer do I have to wait?

670
01:03:16,672 --> 01:03:19,932
I've had 20 years of waiting ...

671

I also believe the weapon.

674
01:03:28,582 --> 01:03:30,697
you have to wait.

675
01:03:30,697 --> 01:03:32,675
For this.

676
01:03:46,576 --> 01:03:48,301
Okay thank you.

Now pujas for Sindhu mother.

You've never seen this festival before.

679
01:04:02,258 --> 01:04:03,934
At this full moon night.

680
01:04:03,934 --> 01:04:05,613

What are you doing ?

691
01:11:10,477 --> 01:11:11,953
Why did you come here?

692
01:11:11,953 --> 01:11:13,079
Chaani

01:11:14,219 --> 01:11:15,852
A deep desire of my heart.

I'll tell you.

695
01:11:19,629 --> 01:11:21,097
Desire ...how.

696
01:11:21,522 --> 01:11:23,104
When I lived.

697
01:11:23,104 --> 01:11:26,115
I do not know where life will take me.

698
01:11:27,062 --> 01:11:28,324
However these days.

699
01:11:28,324 --> 01:11:30,452
I can confidently say.

700
01:11:30,452 --> 01:11:32,354
that in every step in.

701
01:11:32,354 --> 01:11:34,550
I found you.

702
01:11:35,945 --> 01:11:38,016
You are my partner, Chaan.

703
01:11:39,765 --> 01:11:41,168
Does your heart say the same thing?

704
01:11:43,415 --> 01:11:45,162
Yes.

705
01:11:47,308 --> 01:11:48,864
Chaani.

706
01:11:51,425 --> 01:11:52,456
Chaani.

707
01:11:52,456 --> 01:11:54,606
I was changing clothes.

708
01:11:54,606 --> 01:11:56,247
OK.

709
01:11:56,247 --> 01:11:59,016
I want to ask you.

710
01:11:59,016 --> 01:12:01,301
I'm listening.

711
01:12:02,690 --> 01:12:06,049
Why are you hanging around in the market without a crown?

712
01:12:06,049 --> 01:12:08,622
Who is your friend at the time?

713
01:12:13,962 --> 01:12:16,314
What is the purpose of your question Oonjha?

714
01:12:17,816 --> 01:12:20,220
My friend at that time was Junu

715
01:12:42,186 --> 01:12:44,226
Clothes located here.

716
01:12:47,663 --> 01:12:51,929
Clothes located here.

717
01:12:56,354 --> 01:12:57,856
I know and

718
01:12:57,856 --> 01:13:01,087
I covered my honor.

719
01:13:02,381 --> 01:13:05,284
You go, so that I could get out.

720
01:13:06,423 --> 01:13:07,437
OK.

721
01:13:17,769 --> 01:13:20,747
how can you do this?

722
01:13:20,747 --> 01:13:23,569
You're taking advantage of smallness.

723
01:13:23,569 --> 01:13:25,070
Chance ?

724
01:13:25,070 --> 01:13:26,806
I take advantage of you.

725
01:13:26,806 --> 01:13:29,240
I've seen your eyes.

726
01:13:29,240 --> 01:13:30,404
I could do nothing.

727
01:13:30,404 --> 01:13:32,590
I just saw you in anger only.

728
01:13:35,437 --> 01:13:38,161
True, you are very naughty eyes.

729
01:13:38,161 --> 01:13:40,007
The look said something, and when it comes to talk to another.

730
01:13:43,197 --> 01:13:45,124
Now you already know.

731
01:13:45,124 --> 01:13:47,052
how do you feel?

732
01:13:48,764 --> 01:13:50,654
I do not know.

733
01:13:51,721 --> 01:13:53,803
Do it again.

734
01:14:14,508 --> 01:14:15,564
No.

735
01:14:15,564 --> 01:14:16,836
This is not good.

736
01:14:17,941 --> 01:14:19,577
I can not do.

737
01:14:20,824 --> 01:14:21,874
Why /

738
01:14:22,975 --> 01:14:25,755
It does not fit / Is what is not appropriate, Chaani?

739
01:14:27,088 --> 01:14:29,435
We can not unite, Sarman.

740
01:14:29,435 --> 01:14:31,497
Everything is predetermined.

741
01:14:31,497 --> 01:14:33,726
What has been determined, Chaani?

742
01:14:36,056 --> 01:14:37,430
Tell me.

743
01:14:38,372 --> 01:14:40,546
I'm going to marry Moonjha.

744
01:14:41,375 --> 01:14:42,877
Married to Moonjha.

745
01:14:44,182 --> 01:14:46,392
When was this decided?

746
01:14:47,642 --> 01:14:49,349
When I was born.

747
01:14:52,502 --> 01:14:55,621
When a baby is born, where her mother had died.

748
01:14:55,621 --> 01:14:57,892
Mohenjo Daro said as Saaya (shadow).

749
01:14:57,892 --> 01:15:00,557
They all go without seeing my face.

750
01:15:01,612 --> 01:15:04,556
At that time there was a clever coming to that place.

751
01:15:05,648 --> 01:15:07,597
This girl ..

752
01:15:07,597 --> 01:15:09,582
blessing of the mother Sindhu.

753
01:15:09,582 --> 01:15:12,397
This is the beauty of Mohenjo daro.

754
01:15:12,397 --> 01:15:15,456
The future of this town ..

755
01:15:15,456 --> 01:15:17,876
in his hands.

756
01:15:17,876 --> 01:15:19,980
A time will come

757
01:15:19,980 --> 01:15:21,722
that your daughter

758
01:15:21,722 --> 01:15:23,499
will give a new light.

759
01:15:24,748 --> 01:15:27,464
When Maham comphrehend I was blessed by Mother Sindhu.

760
01:15:27,464 --> 01:15:30,792
and he brought a marriage proposal to my house.

761
01:15:30,792 --> 01:15:34,687
and said in front of the citizens of that time.

762
01:15:34,687 --> 01:15:37,057
that if I became a woman I will marry Moonjha.

763
01:15:37,057 --> 01:15:39,553
This engagement has been set, Sarman.

764
01:15:39,553 --> 01:15:41,752
No one will not be able to change it.

765
01:15:48,785 --> 01:15:53,291
None of decision unchangeable.

766
01:15:56,311 --> 01:15:57,405
sarman /

767
01:15:59,160 --> 01:16:00,076

768
01:16:01,973 --> 01:16:03,558
Chaani.

769
01:16:04,190 --> 01:16:05,700
Reversed.

770
01:16:09,023 --> 01:16:10,705
From here ..

771
01:16:13,529 --> 01:16:14,961
Go.

772
01:16:39,992 --> 01:16:41,095
What ?

773
01:16:41,095 --> 01:16:42,359
Yes.

774
01:16:44,025 --> 01:16:44,863
What ?

775
01:16:44,863 --> 01:16:47,157
and you too..with him ..

776
01:16:48,926 --> 01:16:51,342
Chaani, you're not his equal.

777
01:16:51,342 --> 01:16:52,976
If MOonjha know.

778
01:16:52,976 --> 01:16:55,719
he is here.

779
01:17:02,033 --> 01:17:04,560
Welcome to a place of worship, .

780
01:17:09,871 --> 01:17:12,519
All requirements and worship are met, priest.

781
01:17:12,519 --> 01:17:14,564
It was the time now.

782
01:17:14,564 --> 01:17:16,723
when you keep your promise.

783
01:17:26,794 --> 01:17:28,920
If I ask for more time, how is it?

784
01:17:28,920 --> 01:17:31,406
He is still very young.

785
01:17:31,406 --> 01:17:33,456
but your daughter's behavior was no longer young.

786
01:17:33,456 --> 01:17:37,062
I've listened to her story.

787
01:17:37,062 --> 01:17:40,437
Now to wait any longer is not allowed.

788
01:17:41,510 --> 01:17:46,655
maham, I asked for some time yet, let me talk to Chaani.

789
01:17:46,655 --> 01:17:50,139
No, this is already a decision, Priest

790
01:17:51,160 --> 01:17:54,053
and who can not run my decision.

791
01:17:54,053 --> 01:17:56,063
you already know the result.

792
01:17:57,059 --> 01:18:00,066
If you're not the father of Chaani.

793
01:18:03,349 --> 01:18:05,691
Prepare everything.

794
01:18:05,691 --> 01:18:10,637
In the near future Moojha and Chaani be married.

795
01:18:42,071 --> 01:18:43,224
Chaani.

796
01:18:44,866 --> 01:18:46,603
See you ..

797
01:18:46,603 --> 01:18:48,913
I remember my wedding day.

798
01:18:50,127 --> 01:18:53,706
you silent, I know why.

799
01:18:53,706 --> 01:18:56,559
that you do not like to Moonjha.

800
01:18:56,559 --> 01:19:00,276
I am Maham's wife

801
01:19:01,484 --> 01:19:04,161
but I was there and there was no

802
01:19:04,161 --> 01:19:06,399
there will be no change.

803
01:19:07,813 --> 01:19:09,939
But I know

804
01:19:10,278 --> 01:19:14,572
My son is like his father.

805
01:19:14,572 --> 01:19:17,722
too stubborn.

806
01:19:18,845 --> 01:19:20,687
But I am very happy.

807
01:19:20,687 --> 01:19:22,885
because you're with me.

808
01:19:22,885 --> 01:19:26,388
and he would have changed.

809
01:19:26,388 --> 01:19:28,658
You're going to marry him / - Chaani

810
01:19:30,629 --> 01:19:33,324
Junu, you come along with Chaani.

811
01:19:34,122 --> 01:19:37,418
When the time will come to get married, I'll get her.

812
01:19:40,228 --> 01:19:41,933
Sarman.

813
01:19:47,269 --> 01:19:49,026
residents of Mohenjo daro.

814
01:19:49,026 --> 01:19:52,242
With the marriage between Moonjha and Chaani

815
01:19:52,242 --> 01:19:54,554
will change the new atmosphere.

816
01:19:54,554 --> 01:19:56,615
and because of it.

817
01:19:56,615 --> 01:19:58,552
I acquiesced.

818
01:19:58,552 --> 01:20:00,181
that Moonjha.

819
01:20:00,181 --> 01:20:02,154
will be the next leader.

820
01:20:02,154 --> 01:20:05,938
and became the leader of Mohenjo daro

821
01:20:19,910 --> 01:20:21,552
Chaani.

822
01:20:21,552 --> 01:20:23,461
What are you doing here ?

823
01:20:23,461 --> 01:20:25,126
why do you want to marry Moonjha?

824
01:20:25,126 --> 01:20:26,997
When you do not love him.

825
01:20:27,568 --> 01:20:29,983
I do not have the right to choose my partner, Sarman.

826
01:20:29,983 --> 01:20:32,454
I only carry the promise of my father.

827
01:20:32,454 --> 01:20:34,169
No, Chaani.

828
01:20:34,169 --> 01:20:36,135
Not a promise from your father.

829
01:20:36,135 --> 01:20:38,004
you have follow the decision of Maham.

830
01:20:38,004 --> 01:20:40,040
If you become a companion

831
01:20:40,040 --> 01:20:41,678
not in this way.

832
01:20:41,678 --> 01:20:43,506
should be from your heart.

833
01:20:43,506 --> 01:20:45,214
and your heart

834
01:20:45,214 --> 01:20:47,228
not choose Moonjha.

835
01:20:47,228 --> 01:20:48,911
You do not understand, Sarman.

836
01:20:48,911 --> 01:20:51,668
The Marriage between me and Moonjha is due

837
01:20:51,668 --> 01:20:57,627
to change a new setting to Mohenjo daro

838
01:20:57,627 --> 01:21:02,492
And for the future, there is a new light.

839
01:21:02,492 --> 01:21:04,266
the desirable lots.

840
01:21:04,266 --> 01:21:06,352
Chaani, you ..

841
01:21:07,488 --> 01:21:11,103
Do you think the law Maham can save all this.

842
01:21:11,103 --> 01:21:14,125
He's just using you.

843
01:21:14,125 --> 01:21:18,133
and this marriage is only for the selfishness of Maham.

844
01:21:18,133 --> 01:21:20,425
how the new life will come?

845
01:21:21,885 --> 01:21:24,693
You're don't afraid to Maham, Chaani.

846
01:21:24,693 --> 01:21:27,233
I will be with you.

847
01:21:27,233 --> 01:21:29,205
Chaani..Chaani ..

848
01:21:30,447 --> 01:21:32,750
Hurry up, the time has come to get married.

849
01:21:34,932 --> 01:21:36,684
Maham never listened rejection.

850
01:21:36,684 --> 01:21:39,424
and anyone who opposes him, he would kill him.

851
01:21:39,424 --> 01:21:42,420
If I decide this relationship ..

852
01:21:42,420 --> 01:21:45,319
then my father and Mohenjo Daro citizens will suffer the consequences.

853
01:21:46,431 --> 01:21:50,392
You now, it does not have to be you.

854
01:21:51,791 --> 01:21:54,185
Which became the conviction of citizens of Mohenjo daro.

855
01:21:56,851 --> 01:21:59,304
Naani ..

856
01:22:00,214 --> 01:22:01,594
Sarman, you just go.

857
01:22:01,594 --> 01:22:02,905
you listen to your heart, Chaani

858
01:22:02,905 --> 01:22:04,712
I also listened to my heart and come here.

859
01:22:04,712 --> 01:22:06,747
The heart is pure.

860
01:22:06,747 --> 01:22:09,261
He will choose the best.

861
01:22:10,667 --> 01:22:12,033
Moonjha.

862
01:22:19,030 --> 01:22:20,214
Moonjha / Shut up.

863
01:23:13,082 --> 01:23:15,667
Junu, please inform father.

864
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:38,864
Our daughter will be married, and we were not allowed to enter the natural ked too ,.

865
01:24:07,277 --> 01:24:09,282
Wait, Moonjha.

866
01:24:11,403 --> 01:24:12,510
Let him go.

867
01:24:22,086 --> 01:24:23,148
Who are you ?

868
01:24:23,148 --> 01:24:27,573
How dare you attack the new leader at Mohenjo Daro.

869
01:24:27,573 --> 01:24:30,788
and also this asshole.

870
01:24:30,788 --> 01:24:32,482
dare touched my future wife.

871
01:24:38,575 --> 01:24:42,414
so you're the people who make the local inhabitants to revolt.

872
01:24:44,485 --> 01:24:47,108
And punishment for him.

873
01:24:47,108 --> 01:24:48,423
will be obtained now.

874
01:24:48,423 --> 01:24:49,838
The death penalty.

875
01:24:59,743 --> 01:25:01,152
Forgive him.

876
01:25:02,261 --> 01:25:04,190
He is a stranger.

877
01:25:04,190 --> 01:25:07,320
he did it by accident.

878
01:25:07,320 --> 01:25:10,209
He did not understand the rules and regulations in this Mohenjo Daro.

879
01:25:10,209 --> 01:25:13,454
Don't take the burden of his death sentence for you, Maham.

880
01:25:13,454 --> 01:25:16,692
No, he did not have to obtain a pardon.

881
01:25:16,692 --> 01:25:20,276
Hanging him so that his head separated from his body.

882
01:25:20,276 --> 01:25:21,753
No, Moonjha.

883
01:25:23,155 --> 01:25:26,349
He had to undergo yet she was afraid.

884
01:25:26,228 --> 01:25:28,674
Ok..

885
01:25:28,674 --> 01:25:30,898
I have resisted.

886
01:25:30,898 --> 01:25:34,624
and he would see my apology statement.

887
01:25:36,230 --> 01:25:39,759
The priest asked for this young man.

888
01:25:39,759 --> 01:25:42,720
apology

889
01:25:42,720 --> 01:25:46,209
I'll agree.

890
01:25:46,209 --> 01:25:49,158
 I make a decision..

891
01:25:50,757 --> 01:25:55,108
he will get a chance to save himself.

892
01:25:55,108 --> 01:25:56,845
But..

893
01:25:56,845 --> 01:25:59,148
he must undergo examination.

894
01:25:59,148 --> 01:26:01,263
What test, Noble.

895
01:26:01,263 --> 01:26:03,083
Which test ..

896
01:26:03,083 --> 01:26:06,709
Sindhu is being asked by the mother.

897
01:26:06,709 --> 01:26:10,870
Bhakan zhokar test.

898
01:26:12,208 --> 01:26:15,030
I agree with your examination.

899
01:26:18,452 --> 01:26:20,041
but I had one wish.

900
01:26:20,041 --> 01:26:23,562
You're going to die, and still have the desire as well.

901
01:26:23,562 --> 01:26:25,653
yes this is my last request.

902
01:26:25,653 --> 01:26:27,630
What's that ?

903
01:26:29,132 --> 01:26:30,955
If I win.

904
01:26:30,955 --> 01:26:34,353
then released Chaani from this marriage.

905
01:26:35,986 --> 01:26:37,964
He will not marry Moonjha.

906
01:26:49,125 --> 01:26:51,058
I agree.

907
01:26:55,005 --> 01:26:57,529
During Ms. Sindhu did not do the suffering.

908
01:26:57,529 --> 01:27:00,569
Mohenjo Daro will not hear the drum sound.

909
01:27:04,533 --> 01:27:06,342
and carry him.

Translated By S. Sutha Nantha Barathi, SE 

911
01:27:52,819 --> 01:27:54,322
What happened was not a good thing.

912
01:27:56,284 --> 01:27:59,857
Sarman, I want to tell you something.

913
01:27:59,857 --> 01:28:02,678
you should know.

914
01:28:04,064 --> 01:28:05,028
What's that ?

915
01:28:05,028 --> 01:28:07,004
Before him.

916
01:28:07,004 --> 01:28:09,129
Who led at Mohenjo Daro.

917
01:28:09,129 --> 01:28:11,840
his name is..

918
01:28:11,840 --> 01:28:14,593
Surjan.

919
01:28:14,593 --> 01:28:16,868
Your Father.

920
01:28:20,392 --> 01:28:21,503
My dad.

921
01:28:22,980 --> 01:28:24,846
Leaders at Mohenjo Daro.

922
01:28:26,292 --> 01:28:27,684
But how can this be?

923
01:28:27,684 --> 01:28:29,321
Iam  Amri residents

924
01:28:29,321 --> 01:28:31,288
Your uncle told a lie to you.

925
01:28:31,288 --> 01:28:33,710
about the death of your father.

926
01:28:35,502 --> 01:28:37,180
And he could do nothing.

927
01:28:37,180 --> 01:28:39,988
He did not dare to speak the truth.

928
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:42,081
Truth is how ..

929
01:28:42,081 --> 01:28:45,896
Surjan is a great leader for Mohenjo daro

930
01:28:45,896 --> 01:28:48,209
Maham is a guard for the sale.

931
01:28:48,209 --> 01:28:52,648
and he did a transaction with Sumerian secretly.

932
01:28:53,268 --> 01:28:56,028
and he spoke at that time ..

933
01:28:56,028 --> 01:28:59,770
Sindhu river when the water drain

934
01:28:59,770 --> 01:29:05,041
and he will go to a place that contains gold.

935
01:29:05,625 --> 01:29:08,468
With the sun shining.

936
01:29:08,468 --> 01:29:14,636
and this does not happen everywhere.

937
01:29:14,636 --> 01:29:17,550
I wish at this place.

938
01:29:17,550 --> 01:29:21,058
we build dams so that the water could be stopped.

939
01:29:21,058 --> 01:29:24,536
and we can pull out the gold from its place

940
01:29:25,082 --> 01:29:26,076
dam.

941
01:29:26,076 --> 01:29:29,041
so how the river will flow with water.

942
01:29:29,041 --> 01:29:30,790
It was still flowing.

943
01:29:30,790 --> 01:29:32,211
and for it.

944
01:29:32,211 --> 01:29:36,098
we will dig the ground here so it opens a new way.

945
01:29:36,098 --> 01:29:38,612
which will meet again here.

946
01:29:41,417 --> 01:29:43,284
We should not be doing that.

947
01:29:45,611 --> 01:29:48,172
Sindhu river is like a mother to us.

948
01:29:48,172 --> 01:29:50,484
And if we stop the flow.

949
01:29:50,484 --> 01:29:52,781
They will be angry.

950
01:29:54,712 --> 01:29:57,452
and with the construction of dams create a new stream of water.

951
01:29:57,452 --> 01:30:00,381
and water to be brave and drink from where we can get.

952
01:30:00,381 --> 01:30:03,567
Sindhu river instead of a small river.

953
01:30:03,567 --> 01:30:06,632
premises of a small dam, could not change the flow ..

954
01:30:06,632 --> 01:30:09,032
but due to the gold.

955
01:30:09,032 --> 01:30:11,530
all the foreign merchants who came to Harappa.

956
01:30:11,530 --> 01:30:13,833
Next to Mohenjo Daro.

957
01:30:13,916 --> 01:30:16,084
We will benefit greatly from them.

958
01:30:16,084 --> 01:30:18,809
and make people here a huge advantage.

959
01:30:18,809 --> 01:30:23,349
All the nice house, nice clothes.

960
01:30:23,349 --> 01:30:26,694
Mohenjo Daro will be more powerful than Harappa.

961
01:30:26,694 --> 01:30:30,244
Maham, by making a home in the air

962
01:30:30,244 --> 01:30:31,615
You don't try to affect us here.

963
01:30:31,615 --> 01:30:36,303
That supports me, please raise your hands to open.

964
01:30:36,303 --> 01:30:39,066
and participating with Maham show your fist.

965
01:30:39,066 --> 01:30:42,736
I.. Jakiro, giving support to Surjan.

966
01:30:42,736 --> 01:30:45,414
I.. support Maham

967
01:30:45,792 --> 01:30:47,239
I ..support Maham.

968
01:30:47,239 --> 01:30:48,875
I ..support Surjan.

969
01:30:48,875 --> 01:30:50,663
I ..support Maham.

970
01:30:52,066 --> 01:30:53,475
I support.

971
01:30:53,475 --> 01:30:56,092
I support Surjan.

972
01:30:58,018 --> 01:30:59,502
Its seven support me.

973
01:30:59,502 --> 01:31:01,100
Its seven support Maham.

974
01:31:01,100 --> 01:31:02,709
Priest.

975
01:31:02,709 --> 01:31:05,197
you say.

976
01:31:20,568 --> 01:31:23,241
By afraid of Maham, I do not supposed to do.

977
01:31:23,241 --> 01:31:24,768
I do.

978
01:31:27,158 --> 01:31:29,243
Results in Maham hand.

979
01:31:29,243 --> 01:31:32,379
We'll wake up a dam on the Indus River.

980
01:31:35,892 --> 01:31:36,733
and then..

981
01:31:37,904 --> 01:31:39,838
They began building a dam on the Indus River.

982
01:31:40,625 --> 01:31:43,808
and the citizens support it.

983
01:31:43,808 --> 01:31:48,456
All understanding of the consequences of Maham.

984
01:31:50,728 --> 01:31:55,833
Maham make all sorts of ways to confront the insurgency.

985
01:31:55,833 --> 01:31:59,290
and who do not follow the rules

986
01:31:59,176 --> 01:32:02,395
and they will be killed

987
01:32:04,264 --> 01:32:06,504
He met with robbers on the Kiardar hill 

988
01:32:06,892 --> 01:32:10,417
For Maham but also to keep in the city.

989
01:32:16,063 --> 01:32:17,934
The new track is made for the river.

990
01:32:17,934 --> 01:32:21,267
And the water began to dry up and rocks in it shine.

991
01:32:26,284 --> 01:32:30,033
and your father was still thinking about the dam problem.

992
01:32:30,033 --> 01:32:32,631
Maham has betrayed us.

993
01:32:32,631 --> 01:32:37,108
The dam was so strong that the water will dry up.

994
01:32:38,744 --> 01:32:40,141
We must stop it.

995
01:32:43,404 --> 01:32:45,852
 stop all ..

996
01:32:45,852 --> 01:32:49,151
Dams that you make will make the river flow changes direction

997
01:32:48,929 --> 01:32:52,097
you continue your work.

998
01:32:57,912 --> 01:32:59,334
Hit him.

999
01:33:10,775 --> 01:33:13,100
Maham falsely accused Surjan.

1000
01:33:13,100 --> 01:33:17,036
He put all the gold in his house.

1001
01:33:17,036 --> 01:33:18,714
and then arrested him.

1002
01:33:19,773 --> 01:33:21,426
dear ..

1003
01:33:21,426 --> 01:33:24,792
He does not deserve to be called a leader.

1004
01:33:24,792 --> 01:33:26,393
He's a villain.

1005
01:33:26,393 --> 01:33:28,288
Criminals of this region.

1006
01:33:28,288 --> 01:33:30,767
He should be put to death.

1007
01:33:37,600 --> 01:33:41,789
This is wrong, you do not follow him.

1008
01:33:41,789 --> 01:33:42,972
He is a villain

1009
01:33:42,972 --> 01:33:44,780
He drain treasure of Mohenjo daro.

1010
01:33:46,474 --> 01:33:48,628
Priest, say something.

1011
01:33:48,628 --> 01:33:50,074
You know me since I was a child.

1012
01:33:50,074 --> 01:33:52,155
I can never think bad about Mohenjo Daro.

1013
01:33:52,155 --> 01:33:54,273
Tell me.

1014
01:33:54,273 --> 01:33:55,317
and what did you say ?.

1015
01:33:55,317 --> 01:33:58,084
I just stay quiet.

1016
01:33:58,084 --> 01:34:00,754
I was helpless.

1017
01:34:00,754 --> 01:34:03,352
Chaani do not have anyone who besides me.

1018
01:34:04,964 --> 01:34:07,514
And this evil.

1019
01:34:11,229 --> 01:34:13,477
say it.

1020
01:34:18,191 --> 01:34:19,268
Durjan tell him.

1021
01:34:30,719 --> 01:34:34,289
Why are you silent, Durjan, let's tell them.

1022
01:34:39,867 --> 01:34:41,297
I do not know what's what.

1023
01:34:45,510 --> 01:34:47,776
The death penalty.

1024
01:35:09,795 --> 01:35:11,578
dan..your mother.

1025
01:35:14,118 --> 01:35:15,990
what about her?

1026
01:35:15,990 --> 01:35:19,715
She was traumatized by the incident.

1027
01:35:19,715 --> 01:35:22,538
and he was also died at the same time.

1028
01:35:22,538 --> 01:35:25,057
die.

1029
01:35:33,813 --> 01:35:34,761
and then...

1030
01:35:34,761 --> 01:35:39,054
maham take a chance in the election .

1031
01:35:39,054 --> 01:35:42,186
and manifests himself as a leader.

1032
01:35:42,186 --> 01:35:49,879
and he started to replace all trade regulations, taxes and others.

1033
01:35:49,879 --> 01:35:51,735
and all that was said by Surjan.

1034
01:35:51,735 --> 01:35:53,312
that's what happened.

1035
01:35:53,312 --> 01:35:58,831
As a result of these dams throughout the region experienced a drought and no water.

1036
01:36:00,037 --> 01:36:03,988
and they began to leave their villages and come to Mohenjo Daro.

1037
01:36:03,988 --> 01:36:05,741
The city is developing 

1038
01:36:05,741 --> 01:36:07,454
Population increase.

1039
01:36:07,454 --> 01:36:10,742
and load them bigger in Mohenjo daro.

1040
01:36:12,853 --> 01:36:17,839
Maham give gold to his followers.

1041
01:36:17,839 --> 01:36:19,182
and against with death.

1042
01:36:20,788 --> 01:36:23,807
Surjan did nothing wrong ..

1043
01:36:20,788 --> 01:36:25,973
I'm guilty.

1044
01:36:27,618 --> 01:36:29,109
I'm guilty ,.

1045
01:36:29,109 --> 01:36:33,110
The cause of death Surjan not because of Maham

1046
01:36:34,804 --> 01:36:36,654
I am the cause.

1047
01:36:36,654 --> 01:36:38,518
I..

1048
01:36:38,518 --> 01:36:41,965
How can I apologize to you, Sarman?

1049
01:36:43,738 --> 01:36:45,368
How I can ?

1050
01:36:51,757 --> 01:36:53,179
therefore all ..

1051
01:36:55,007 --> 01:36:56,924
I feel familiar with this place.

1052
01:37:00,682 --> 01:37:02,357
I was born in this land.

1053
01:37:04,079 --> 01:37:06,061
I spent childhood in this place.

1054
01:37:09,490 --> 01:37:11,842
My father sacrificed himself for this city.

1055
01:37:13,937 --> 01:37:16,527
and this city gave him death.

1056
01:37:16,692 --> 01:37:21,090
That has happened, I've told the truth, Sarman.

1057
01:37:22,224 --> 01:37:24,870
Now the mother Sindhu will give a blessing to you.

1058
01:37:25,322 --> 01:37:27,217
and save you ..

1059
01:37:29,185 --> 01:37:32,296
when tomorrow you will deal with them, you must always remember

1060
01:37:32,549 --> 01:37:34,227
Maham more of an enemy than they are.

1061
01:37:34,227 --> 01:37:38,320
which has destroyed your family and destroyed this town.

1062
01:37:38,795 --> 01:37:42,996
You can save this city from gold robbery, Sarman.

1063
01:37:42,996 --> 01:37:46,260
Only you can stop the Maham effort.

1064
01:37:51,833 --> 01:37:53,765
This city .

1065
01:37:55,035 --> 01:37:58,822
Mohenjo Daro.

1066
01:39:09,830 --> 01:39:11,961
Attention !!

1067
01:39:11,961 --> 01:39:13,389
Attention !!

1068
01:39:13,389 --> 01:39:15,316
Now we will begin ..

1069
01:39:15,316 --> 01:39:17,283
A very hard race ..

1070
01:39:24,204 --> 01:39:26,313
A guilty person will be punished ..

1071
01:39:26,313 --> 01:39:29,218
to face Bakhar zhokar ..

1072
01:39:30,916 --> 01:39:34,677
We shall see.

1073
01:39:34,677 --> 01:39:39,304
Who won and who lost ..

1074
01:39:40,597 --> 01:39:44,360
The fight will begin ..

1075
01:40:13,529 --> 01:40:17,571
Weapons ...

1076
01:40:24,871 --> 01:40:26,913
He will take the Trishul ..

1077
01:40:42,646 --> 01:40:46,192
Could begin ..

1078
01:40:48,972 --> 01:40:51,386
The door can be opened ..

1079
01:42:10,648 --> 01:42:16,616
He is Fuel and Zhokar ..

1080
01:42:16,616 --> 01:42:19,064
They are both very strong ..

1081
01:42:19,064 --> 01:42:20,923
They were taken from the hills ..

1082
01:42:20,923 --> 01:42:23,993
to attack  and to kill ..

1083
01:42:23,993 --> 01:42:25,995
to release their hunger ..

1084
01:44:10,883 --> 01:44:12,365
That is ..death ..

1085
01:45:10,092 --> 01:45:11,586
Now Bakar Zhokar will not be happy.

1086
01:48:51,046 --> 01:48:53,622
No....... !!!

1087
01:50:41,134 --> 01:50:44,072
sarman...sarman...

1088
01:50:44,072 --> 01:50:48,871
sarman...sarman...

1089
01:50:48,871 --> 01:50:56,541
sarman...sarman...

1090
01:52:26,314 --> 01:52:28,699
In the view of the host coming to this place ..

1091
01:52:28,699 --> 01:52:30,933
You're the pride of Mohenjo Daro ..

1092
01:52:30,933 --> 01:52:34,098
All citizens have recognized you ..

1093
01:52:34,098 --> 01:52:35,822
They're supporting you ..

1094
01:52:35,822 --> 01:52:37,919
You're the one on their hope ..

1095
01:52:37,919 --> 01:52:40,160
Otherwise future generations will not know ..

1096
01:52:40,160 --> 01:52:42,689
Truth and goodness of Mohenjo daro ..

1097
01:53:05,814 --> 01:53:06,930
Moonjha.

1098
01:53:08,376 --> 01:53:10,670
You must be a leader in Mohenjo Daro.

1099
01:53:11,976 --> 01:53:15,958
But I felt you had to accept defeat.

1100
01:53:17,200 --> 01:53:18,935
Its means ..

1101
01:53:18,935 --> 01:53:21,370
Without a fight and leave the battlefield ..

1102
01:53:22,431 --> 01:53:24,329
I will not let it happen ..

1103
01:53:26,689 --> 01:53:28,905
Who wants to stay in the flower garden ..

1104
01:53:28,905 --> 01:53:32,494
Then have to cut down wild trees  ..

1105
01:53:34,892 --> 01:53:36,511
Priest ..

1106
01:53:36,511 --> 01:53:38,336
Priest ..

1107
01:53:38,336 --> 01:53:40,554
and Chaani ..

1108
01:53:42,610 --> 01:53:44,436
They both no longer needed / - No.

1109
01:53:44,436 --> 01:53:48,070
No dad, it's not the fault of Chaani.

1110
01:53:48,070 --> 01:53:49,806
It is Sarman.

1111
01:53:49,806 --> 01:53:52,838
He affecting Chaani.

1112
01:53:52,838 --> 01:53:57,750
His neck was on hand at the time, but ..

1113
01:53:57,750 --> 01:54:01,578
Now the fire is in me ..

1114
01:54:01,578 --> 01:54:03,233
will make it to ashes ..

1115
01:54:05,489 --> 01:54:07,778
Chaani is mine ..

1116
01:54:08,868 --> 01:54:11,492
Open your eyes wide width, Moonjha.

1117
01:54:11,492 --> 01:54:15,329
Love will destroy you, Moonjha.

1118
01:54:15,329 --> 01:54:17,759
Not love ..

trying to authorities ..

1120
01:54:20,697 --> 01:54:22,706
In the next time ..

1121
01:54:22,706 --> 01:54:24,619
Mohenjo Daro is yours ..

1122
01:54:24,619 --> 01:54:27,321
All Sindhu earth is yours ..

1123
01:54:27,321 --> 01:54:31,233
Where do you want that then it will be yours ..

1124
01:54:31,233 --> 01:54:32,806
but before ..

1125
01:54:32,806 --> 01:54:34,623
Pick up your weapons, Moonjha.

1126
01:54:34,794 --> 01:54:36,291
and shed their blood ..

1127
01:54:36,291 --> 01:54:37,982

1128
01:54:37,982 --> 01:54:40,110
priest also ..

1129
01:54:40,110 --> 01:54:41,755
Sarman also

1130
01:54:41,980 --> 01:54:44,412
No one can see the sun in the morning .

1131
01:55:29,088 --> 01:55:30,241
Moonjha.

1132
01:55:34,479 --> 01:55:36,074
Father..

1133
01:55:38,792 --> 01:55:40,381
Father..

1134
01:55:46,053 --> 01:55:47,173
Moonjha.

1135
01:55:47,173 --> 01:55:48,233
Father..

1136
01:55:50,892 --> 01:55:53,375
Run..

1137
01:55:53,375 --> 01:55:54,446
Father..

1138
01:56:43,701 --> 01:56:46,050
If you can not be mine, then you can not be owned by another person ..

1139
01:57:15,412 --> 01:57:26,180
Barathi Music Medan

1140
02:00:01,559 --> 02:00:03,570
You have to tell them, Sarman ..

1141
02:00:06,813 --> 02:00:08,220
You're listening  all ..

1142
02:00:10,664 --> 02:00:13,324
Sarman has a close relationship with Mohenjo daro.

1143
02:00:13,324 --> 02:00:15,906
where my father knowing the truth.

1144
02:00:15,906 --> 02:00:19,844

1145
02:00:19,844 --> 02:00:22,252
My father tell the truth to Sarman.

1146
02:00:22,252 --> 02:00:24,424
How is the truth, Chaani.

1147
02:00:24,424 --> 02:00:26,802
The truth is ..

1148
02:00:26,802 --> 02:00:30,584
Sarman is the son of our late leaders named Surjan.

1149
02:00:33,579 --> 02:00:34,889
Yes.,.

1150
02:00:34,889 --> 02:00:38,985
who was born on earth we live in this region and the Amrik..

1151
02:00:38,985 --> 02:00:40,881
On this earth ..

1152
02:00:45,756 --> 02:00:47,637
Blackguard.,

1153
02:00:59,865 --> 02:01:01,791
and my father was sure ..

1154
02:01:01,791 --> 02:01:04,639
when all people know the truth ..

1155
02:01:04,639 --> 02:01:06,878
they will support Sarman.

1156
02:01:06,878 --> 02:01:09,902
Yes, we will provide support.

1157
02:01:14,071 --> 02:01:17,658
Maham has blinded us all these years and we live with greed ..

1158
02:01:17,658 --> 02:01:19,561
but our eyes open now ..

1159
02:01:19,561 --> 02:01:22,678
One time we made a mistake, not anymore ..

1160
02:01:22,678 --> 02:01:25,307
Well, son, we are willing to support you ..

1161
02:01:26,344 --> 02:01:27,555
Give direction to us.

1162
02:01:27,555 --> 02:01:29,110
we will support, Sarman.

1163
02:01:29,110 --> 02:01:30,863
OK..

1164
02:01:36,454 --> 02:01:37,714
The first job.

1165
02:01:39,257 --> 02:01:42,104
We will treat the deepest wounds.

1166
02:01:44,434 --> 02:01:47,082
where citizens sacrifice themselves to Mohenjo Daro.

1167
02:01:48,277 --> 02:01:50,589
We will give honor to their death.

1168
02:01:51,725 --> 02:01:54,174
We will make arrangements for the final rites to them.

1169
02:01:56,496 --> 02:01:57,701
Yes, Sarman.

1170
02:01:57,701 --> 02:01:59,091
you are truthful.

1171
02:01:59,091 --> 02:02:00,665
Let's do it.

1172
02:02:10,459 --> 02:02:12,377
Look at this ..

1173
02:02:12,377 --> 02:02:14,605
The body of Surjan said about the truth.

1174
02:02:26,747 --> 02:02:27,856
My dad.

1175
02:03:06,115 --> 02:03:07,728
Surjan.

1176
02:03:46,577 --> 02:03:49,372
Prepare the last journey of my son ..

1177
02:03:50,603 --> 02:03:53,313
accordance with the customs and traditions ..

1178
02:03:53,313 --> 02:03:55,619
Moonjha ashes will circulate in the air ..

1179
02:03:55,619 --> 02:03:59,016
I had nothing to do with customs again ..

1180
02:03:59,016 --> 02:04:01,280
You have a duty to give birth to her ..

1181
02:04:01,280 --> 02:04:04,013
That relationship has ended many years ago ..

1182
02:04:04,013 --> 02:04:06,153
Anyone who violates this custom?

1183
02:04:07,427 --> 02:04:09,634
You're the one who betrayed him.

1184
02:04:12,553 --> 02:04:14,528
What is the reason you to take revenge?

1185
02:04:16,003 --> 02:04:17,719
and until when are you going to retaliate you humiliation

1186
02:04:17,719 --> 02:04:21,998
This weapon can not bring back your son.

1187
02:04:21,998 --> 02:04:26,197
You can not take revenge on them.

1188
02:04:26,197 --> 02:04:30,001
All the destruction that happened at Mohenjo Daro.

1189
02:04:30,001 --> 02:04:31,881
You do that.

1190
02:04:31,881 --> 02:04:34,822
My son's death as well as you.

1191
02:04:44,227 --> 02:04:45,979
you know who is Sarman?

1192
02:04:47,262 --> 02:04:49,208
He is the son of Surjan.

1193
02:04:53,119 --> 02:04:55,398
You have to suspend his father ..

1194
02:04:55,398 --> 02:04:58,031
and he did the same thing to your son.

1195
02:04:58,031 --> 02:04:59,981
The justice of the mother Sindhu.

1196
02:05:01,294 --> 02:05:04,429
You have to kill your son, Maham.

1197
02:05:04,429 --> 02:05:06,849
and now whatever decision

1198
02:05:06,849 --> 02:05:09,159
you can not stop your destruction.

1199
02:05:14,004 --> 02:05:15,798
Son of Surjan.

1200
02:05:17,250 --> 02:05:19,459
Sarman, son of Surjan.

1201
02:05:24,360 --> 02:05:27,305
Many years ago, the Indus flows from this place.

1202
02:05:34,046 --> 02:05:34,803
Hurry up...

1203
02:05:34,803 --> 02:05:36,217
Hurry up...

1204
02:05:43,366 --> 02:05:44,562
Quickly quickly done ..

1205
02:05:44,562 --> 02:05:46,808
Before sunrise the next day.

1206
02:05:46,808 --> 02:05:49,143
We must send the train ..

1207
02:05:56,184 --> 02:05:57,275
Quickly cleaned.

1208
02:05:57,275 --> 02:06:00,175
Put them in the carriage.

1209
02:07:02,409 --> 02:07:03,374
sarman.

1210
02:07:03,374 --> 02:07:05,517
I know the truth and supporting Maham.

1211
02:07:05,517 --> 02:07:07,111
a guard at Mohenjo Daro.

1212
02:07:07,111 --> 02:07:09,041
you say, what our next plan ..

1213
02:07:09,041 --> 02:07:11,780
All carriages belonging to foreign traders Sumer

1214
02:07:11,954 --> 02:07:13,365
already set off with gold.

1215
02:07:14,603 --> 02:07:15,638
We must stop it.

1216
02:07:15,638 --> 02:07:17,376
and, This is our initial plan ..

1217
02:07:17,376 --> 02:07:19,168
to prove fraud Maham to all citizens.

1218
02:07:19,988 --> 02:07:20,751
OK.

1219
02:07:20,751 --> 02:07:21,960
when we will start ?

1220
02:07:21,960 --> 02:07:23,103
Right now.

1221
02:07:31,254 --> 02:07:34,195
This road will go directly to Dolavira

1222
02:07:34,514 --> 02:07:36,267
Thank you..

1223
02:07:43,362 --> 02:07:44,351
What is wrong ?

1224
02:08:21,426 --> 02:08:22,774
I'm a trader.

1225
02:08:22,774 --> 02:08:24,098
You're not a trader but a destroyer.

1226
02:08:24,098 --> 02:08:27,424
Again if you look on this earth and Sindhu.

1227
02:08:27,424 --> 02:08:29,589
then you have to deal with me.

1228
02:08:42,992 --> 02:08:43,971
Banu.

1229
02:08:45,636 --> 02:08:46,863
Listen carefully.

1230
02:08:46,863 --> 02:08:48,846
You wait at the dam.

1231
02:08:48,846 --> 02:08:49,950
Let the water run.

1232
02:08:49,950 --> 02:08:51,906
If there are problems, give me the news.

1233
02:08:51,906 --> 02:08:53,043
Well ,you leave.

1234
02:08:59,309 --> 02:09:00,438
Honourable.

1235
02:09:00,438 --> 02:09:01,869
Honourable.

1236
02:09:03,290 --> 02:09:05,899
Sarman and his followers had robbed the gold.

1237
02:09:06,547 --> 02:09:07,389
What ?

1238
02:09:07,389 --> 02:09:09,826
They have opened the dam.

1239
02:09:09,826 --> 02:09:13,074
We are now dealing with all citizens.,

1240
02:09:13,074 --> 02:09:15,177
how could this happen ?

1241
02:09:17,281 --> 02:09:19,912
Before sunrise.

1242
02:09:19,912 --> 02:09:23,473
Sarman and followers must die.

1243
02:09:23,473 --> 02:09:24,811
depart

1244
02:09:26,434 --> 02:09:27,224
Listen.

1245
02:09:27,224 --> 02:09:31,626
Tell me, we will make an emergency meeting.

1246
02:09:31,626 --> 02:09:34,008
So far, we have always said

1247
02:09:34,008 --> 02:09:35,989
with gold, we will get in return

1248
02:09:35,989 --> 02:09:38,448
which will be made for the betterment of the city.

1249
02:09:39,991 --> 02:09:41,460
But this did not happen.

1250
02:09:43,848 --> 02:09:47,234
Maham change the gold with this weapon ..

1251
02:09:49,081 --> 02:09:50,599
Sword weapon.

1252
02:09:52,432 --> 02:09:53,355
and now..

1253
02:09:53,355 --> 02:09:54,856
using this weapon

1254
02:09:54,856 --> 02:09:56,909
we always want to fight with other cities.

1255
02:09:56,909 --> 02:09:59,130
he wanted revenge for his humiliation ..

1256
02:09:59,130 --> 02:10:00,601
and this is why.

1257
02:10:00,601 --> 02:10:03,632
therefore he made the dams.

1258
02:10:05,445 --> 02:10:07,258
rise your hand

1259
02:10:07,258 --> 02:10:09,134
time to fight

1260
02:10:10,481 --> 02:10:11,981
Let's get to the place of the hearing / meeting ..

1261
02:11:24,483 --> 02:11:26,057
Sarman already know all the truth, Maham.

1262
02:11:27,567 --> 02:11:32,095
and now in front of you ..

1263
02:11:32,095 --> 02:11:34,949
Here begin from this second.

1264
02:11:34,949 --> 02:11:36,959
end of your cruelty.

1265
02:11:36,959 --> 02:11:39,876
Who will put an end to my life?

1266
02:11:39,876 --> 02:11:42,765
Who would dare ...

1267
02:11:47,946 --> 02:11:52,092
you have to call your death, Sarman.

1268
02:11:52,092 --> 02:11:55,794
All heads were erect in front of me, already I cut.

1269
02:11:55,794 --> 02:11:58,739
Surjan also I hung before.

1270
02:12:06,776 --> 02:12:09,498
remember, have you turn it on, I was the fire ..

1271
02:12:10,982 --> 02:12:12,853
I am the murderer weapons, Maham.

1272
02:12:16,646 --> 02:12:18,321
Kill him.

1273
02:12:18,321 --> 02:12:19,855
Attack him.

1274
02:12:19,855 --> 02:12:22,789
and in return you will get the gold.

1275
02:12:22,789 --> 02:12:24,944
I do not have anything for them.

1276
02:12:26,230 --> 02:12:29,336
you have to buy weapons by selling gold.

1277
02:12:30,364 --> 02:12:32,041
You're just alone, Maham.

1278
02:12:33,145 --> 02:12:34,503
just alone.

1279
02:12:38,021 --> 02:12:39,243
No.

1280
02:12:39,243 --> 02:12:42,216
do not follow him.

1281
02:12:42,216 --> 02:12:43,998
I'm still your leader.

1282
02:12:43,998 --> 02:12:45,682
and I guard you.

1283
02:12:45,682 --> 02:12:48,313
Our work is not for you Maham, but for gold.

1284
02:12:48,313 --> 02:12:51,730
and I know now for this trade.

1285
02:12:51,730 --> 02:12:53,071
there was nothing left.

1286
02:12:55,626 --> 02:12:58,435
By switching hands for gold, you've brainstorm.

1287
02:12:58,435 --> 02:13:01,720
Greed was the talk, Sarman.

1288
02:13:01,720 --> 02:13:04,461
What difference do you

1289
02:13:04,461 --> 02:13:06,100
and me

1290
02:13:10,440 --> 02:13:11,696
different , Maham.

1291
02:13:11,696 --> 02:13:14,354
You must be powered at Mohenjo Daro.

1292
02:13:15,460 --> 02:13:16,992
and I for their services.

1293
02:13:18,173 --> 02:13:20,024
The same thing done by my father.

1294
02:13:22,655 --> 02:13:24,453
This city is mine, Maham.

1295
02:13:24,453 --> 02:13:27,130
Was my father named Surjan.

1296
02:13:33,626 --> 02:13:35,069
The leaders in this trial.

1297
02:13:35,069 --> 02:13:37,860
supporting Maham show with open arms.

1298
02:13:37,860 --> 02:13:39,978
against him

1299
02:13:39,978 --> 02:13:41,529
