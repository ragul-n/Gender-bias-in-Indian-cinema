1
00:01:34,284 --> 00:01:39,483
Mumbai - a city that never sleeps.

2
00:01:40,423 --> 00:01:44,325
A city that dreams
even when awake.

3
00:01:45,395 --> 00:01:49,297
A city where lights glitter
high on the skyline.

4
00:01:49,966 --> 00:01:54,460
A city where there is
a ravine of silent darkness.

5
00:01:55,071 --> 00:02:02,500
A city where a difference between
humans has created another world.

6
00:03:12,115 --> 00:03:14,140
As per the police records...

7
00:03:14,517 --> 00:03:18,180
...there are many big and small
gangs present in Mumbai's underworld.

8
00:03:18,555 --> 00:03:22,184
Due to the daily making and breaking
of partnerships, internal squabbles...

9
00:03:22,692 --> 00:03:29,928
and switching of loyalties, murder,
mayhem and shootouts are commonplace.

10
00:03:31,234 --> 00:03:35,136
In such a prevailing atmosphere,
comes a man from somewhere.

11
00:03:35,572 --> 00:03:38,006
This is his story.

12
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,190
Greetings, Sir!

13
00:04:05,435 --> 00:04:08,233
Hello. How are things?

14
00:04:08,271 --> 00:04:10,364
I am only cleaning.

15
00:04:10,407 --> 00:04:12,967
Don't clean the buffaloes so much
that their colour ends up changing!

16
00:04:13,009 --> 00:04:16,206
Come on, this is your room.

17
00:04:18,415 --> 00:04:23,580
This is your corner. You've to pay
Rs.20 daily. Do you have some cash?

18
00:04:25,889 --> 00:04:28,949
I need advance money.
It's a fantastic place.

19
00:04:29,225 --> 00:04:32,456
The buffaloes will wake you at dawn;
you just don't need an alarm clock!

20
00:04:32,929 --> 00:04:35,591
Wake up... baah!

21
00:04:35,632 --> 00:04:38,123
- Goodbye!
- Will I get some work?

22
00:04:40,036 --> 00:04:41,560
Will anything do?

23
00:04:50,313 --> 00:04:52,577
Hey, listen! Bring me
two bottles of beer.

24
00:04:52,615 --> 00:04:53,547
Okay.

25
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:02,082
I'll explain to him.
Why are you getting worked up?

26
00:05:03,092 --> 00:05:04,286
I'll phone you later.

27
00:05:05,128 --> 00:05:07,722
- Hello, Jaggabhai!
- Hello, Mr. Shanti!

28
00:05:08,198 --> 00:05:12,259
You're counting a lot of hard cash,
sitting behind the counter, huh?

29
00:05:14,037 --> 00:05:16,972
Not hard cash. There's a
scarcity of even coins!

30
00:05:19,075 --> 00:05:22,408
Hey, listen! Bring a glass
of whiskey for Jaggabhai.

31
00:05:23,379 --> 00:05:24,812
What's happening?

32
00:05:25,815 --> 00:05:27,112
Tell me about yourself.

33
00:05:27,517 --> 00:05:30,509
What do I say?
Business is very slack now.

34
00:05:30,887 --> 00:05:33,617
Nobody visits the bar
during the holy month.

35
00:05:33,957 --> 00:05:36,755
Then why have you
kept it open? Shut it.

36
00:05:37,494 --> 00:05:41,487
What are you saying!
Business is indeed slack.

37
00:05:41,931 --> 00:05:45,389
Why are you talking nonsense?

38
00:05:45,668 --> 00:05:50,503
I don't keep the extortion
money which you give me.

39
00:05:51,074 --> 00:05:52,336
I give it to Gurubhai.

40
00:05:52,742 --> 00:05:56,075
And he has asked me
to get money from you.

41
00:05:56,779 --> 00:06:01,807
Tell me, what should I tell him?
That you don't have the money?

42
00:06:02,218 --> 00:06:05,813
No. Why involve Gurubhai
in such petty issues?

43
00:06:06,589 --> 00:06:09,649
You do understand
but you need to be explained.

44
00:06:09,792 --> 00:06:12,818
I will understand but I need
some kind of signal too!

45
00:06:15,265 --> 00:06:17,358
Swine! He doesn't know
how to mix a drink!

46
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,661
- He is new.
- Replace him!

47
00:06:19,836 --> 00:06:22,703
Forgive him.

48
00:06:23,306 --> 00:06:26,366
What are you looking at?
Why are you staring?!

49
00:06:26,743 --> 00:06:28,506
Get going!

50
00:06:28,845 --> 00:06:31,279
Go away from here!

51
00:06:31,714 --> 00:06:35,150
I will not spare the swine!

52
00:06:42,792 --> 00:06:45,818
Come here. I have given you
such a lovely job.

53
00:06:46,195 --> 00:06:48,959
Wine and women! You have them all!
Have you got the money?

54
00:06:49,465 --> 00:06:53,231
Remove it. Why are you taking
so long? Give me another bill.

55
00:06:55,605 --> 00:06:59,632
Hey, is this bearded man
new here? Write his name.

56
00:07:00,376 --> 00:07:02,674
Give me Rs. 100.

57
00:07:02,779 --> 00:07:03,803
Why?

58
00:07:04,681 --> 00:07:06,012
He asks why!

59
00:07:06,516 --> 00:07:08,177
Hey, rascal, let him ask!

60
00:07:08,618 --> 00:07:11,086
He is giving us dough,
so he has to ask.

61
00:07:11,487 --> 00:07:14,650
Do you want the orchestra playing
here? Come on, give me the money!

62
00:07:15,491 --> 00:07:17,618
Hey, beardie! Remove the money!

63
00:07:18,494 --> 00:07:22,260
Why are you challenging them? Just
pay them. They are Jagga's men.

64
00:07:22,765 --> 00:07:27,202
Did you understand now?
Come on, remove the money now.

65
00:07:27,937 --> 00:07:30,838
Hey, you smart man,
don't act too tough!

66
00:07:31,374 --> 00:07:35,105
Beardie, have you become chicken,
seeing the razor?

67
00:07:43,586 --> 00:07:47,522
He slashed my face.

68
00:07:48,224 --> 00:07:50,988
I'll burn the stables!

69
00:07:51,361 --> 00:07:55,263
Somebody fetch water!

70
00:07:55,932 --> 00:07:57,957
Why are you just looking?
Go and fetch some water.

71
00:08:09,746 --> 00:08:11,145
Who the hell is it!

72
00:08:13,149 --> 00:08:14,639
Who is responsible for this?

73
00:08:17,553 --> 00:08:20,545
Hey, listen! ...Is your name Satya?

74
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:25,025
Come on.

75
00:08:30,867 --> 00:08:35,463
You raise your hand
on Jaggabhai's man!

76
00:08:44,247 --> 00:08:46,909
You raise your hand
on Jaggabhai's man! Rascal!

77
00:09:01,764 --> 00:09:03,129
I am going out for 2 hours.

78
00:09:03,299 --> 00:09:05,824
By the time I return, at least
finish off the shooting here!

79
00:09:05,868 --> 00:09:07,358
Okay, Sir.

80
00:09:13,376 --> 00:09:15,571
Sir, my name is Shaukat.
I have worked for Mahesh Bhatt.

81
00:09:15,912 --> 00:09:17,573
- Come later.
- I wanted to meet you.

82
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:19,748
Come later.

83
00:09:23,686 --> 00:09:26,177
My name is Ajay. These are my
photographs. Please take a look.

84
00:09:26,222 --> 00:09:27,814
- Meet the assistant director.
- Should I meet him?

85
00:09:28,157 --> 00:09:30,921
- It'll be good if you put in a word.
- I said go!

86
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:43,336
I will be finishing him off
at the second signal.

87
00:09:44,073 --> 00:09:46,837
- At the crossroad.
- Ask him for the car number.

88
00:09:46,876 --> 00:09:48,969
- Ask the car number.
- What is the car number?

89
00:09:49,345 --> 00:09:52,837
It's a white Esteem
car, correct? All right.

90
00:10:24,781 --> 00:10:28,239
No! I must have the film
released in March at any cost.

91
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:44,963
My leg!

92
00:10:45,568 --> 00:10:48,503
- Try to remove it.
- My leg!

93
00:10:49,405 --> 00:10:52,238
Don't just scream!

94
00:10:53,376 --> 00:10:55,606
Run! ...Scoot!

95
00:10:57,713 --> 00:11:01,046
My leg has been severed!

96
00:11:24,707 --> 00:11:26,641
Where are you going,
spilling the milk?!

97
00:11:55,338 --> 00:11:56,270
Go on.

98
00:11:56,572 --> 00:11:58,267
Bhikubhai, there's been a problem.

99
00:11:58,441 --> 00:11:59,772
Is he dead or alive?

100
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:02,907
- It was brought for me.
- For me!

101
00:12:02,945 --> 00:12:05,971
Do one thing...
Will you shut up?!

102
00:12:08,084 --> 00:12:14,284
Do one thing. Come and meet me
at Uncle Kallu's place.

103
00:12:20,429 --> 00:12:21,953
- What's it?
- Tea.

104
00:12:23,432 --> 00:12:24,592
Hey, come here!

105
00:12:30,806 --> 00:12:32,933
- Has he divulged anything?
- Nothing yet, Sir.

106
00:12:40,516 --> 00:12:41,949
Is this where you are hurt?

107
00:12:46,956 --> 00:12:48,218
Is it paining?

108
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,764
Don't worry. Nothing will happen.

109
00:13:01,771 --> 00:13:04,239
It's only a swelling,
nothing has been broken.

110
00:13:05,308 --> 00:13:07,469
I will call for a doctor.

111
00:13:10,146 --> 00:13:11,841
Who paid the contract money?

112
00:13:13,816 --> 00:13:15,408
Who paid you?

113
00:13:18,688 --> 00:13:19,712
Who?

114
00:13:30,466 --> 00:13:32,434
- Eat this.
- I don't want to eat!

115
00:13:33,035 --> 00:13:34,627
Why? Eat it!

116
00:13:35,471 --> 00:13:37,098
I don't want to eat it!

117
00:13:37,473 --> 00:13:39,270
Eat it, it's tasty.

118
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:42,105
Indeed! I get to eat only
bread and butter everyday!

119
00:13:42,211 --> 00:13:44,236
Hadn't I given you an egg on Sunday?

120
00:13:45,481 --> 00:13:47,039
- Where are you going!
- Somebody's come.

121
00:13:52,688 --> 00:13:53,677
Who's it?

122
00:14:00,963 --> 00:14:05,161
What are you doing!
Leave my father!

123
00:14:09,138 --> 00:14:12,733
I heard that Bhau is going to go
into hiding. Is the information true?

124
00:14:13,309 --> 00:14:18,941
I've heard the same.
But why are you so alarmed?

125
00:14:19,815 --> 00:14:23,911
Why should I be alarmed?
There's none like Bhau.

126
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,351
Everything has been given by him.

127
00:14:27,723 --> 00:14:32,319
I think my boys are
losing their punch.

128
00:14:33,596 --> 00:14:36,724
It's not even a week
and he's already walking!

129
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:41,568
The man who was thrashed the last
time, was not on his feet for a month.

130
00:14:43,506 --> 00:14:48,443
Hey, why are you just looking?
Prepare a drink!

131
00:14:51,747 --> 00:14:54,910
The man has learnt to prepare
a drink properly now, huh?

132
00:14:55,551 --> 00:14:57,542
Hey! Why did you challenge me?

133
00:14:58,421 --> 00:15:02,380
You learn only
after getting thrashed.

134
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:06,387
Hey! Lift your head!

135
00:15:18,908 --> 00:15:22,969
Scoundrel! You raise
your hand on me!

136
00:15:23,746 --> 00:15:26,010
I'll kill him!

137
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:37,154
Was there any phone call
from Mishra?

138
00:15:37,226 --> 00:15:38,625
No, sir.

139
00:15:42,965 --> 00:15:45,763
Indict the scoundrel
for supplying girls!

140
00:15:46,102 --> 00:15:47,592
Lower your head! Get going!

141
00:16:35,017 --> 00:16:37,986
Hey, hero, hurry up! The work
should be done by evening.

142
00:16:50,032 --> 00:16:52,899
What are you doing here?
Go and sit out.

143
00:16:53,035 --> 00:16:54,093
Get going!

144
00:16:59,008 --> 00:17:03,240
What did I tell you? Go out!

145
00:17:10,019 --> 00:17:12,180
Hey, that's enough.

146
00:17:13,189 --> 00:17:15,054
Move aside... move aside!

147
00:17:16,525 --> 00:17:20,552
Do you want to be an
underworld kingpin? Or do you?

148
00:17:26,969 --> 00:17:28,561
Now go.

149
00:17:40,616 --> 00:17:42,277
Hit me.

150
00:17:47,523 --> 00:17:50,253
Hey, super star! Hit me!

151
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:54,052
Hit me, indeed!

152
00:18:04,273 --> 00:18:06,764
He understands a bit too much!

153
00:18:07,142 --> 00:18:10,703
- Fight alone if you have the guts!
- You challenge Bhikubhai!

154
00:18:12,581 --> 00:18:14,208
Hey, go.

155
00:18:16,185 --> 00:18:17,914
Leave him.

156
00:18:26,295 --> 00:18:28,092
He watches too many movies!

157
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:16,602
Shall I finish you off?!

158
00:19:16,645 --> 00:19:19,273
Bloody super star!

159
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:22,239
Scoundrel!

160
00:19:26,121 --> 00:19:28,112
Everybody gets a chance.

161
00:19:51,413 --> 00:19:54,211
He possesses guts! He sure does!

162
00:19:56,685 --> 00:19:58,949
My name is Bhiku.

163
00:19:59,555 --> 00:20:01,318
I said I am Bhiku.

164
00:20:09,732 --> 00:20:12,997
You see, a man tires very easily
if he gets married at a young age!

165
00:20:13,235 --> 00:20:16,762
Don't come in front of my wife.
She will elope with you!

166
00:20:20,242 --> 00:20:21,539
Let's go.

167
00:20:22,578 --> 00:20:24,239
Hey catch!

168
00:20:25,247 --> 00:20:30,549
Hammer the bloody rascal!

169
00:20:34,757 --> 00:20:36,554
Hey! Look at him.

170
00:20:37,259 --> 00:20:40,660
You've been charged for a rape case.
They're going to break your bones!

171
00:20:41,263 --> 00:20:42,992
Beat him black and blue!

172
00:20:46,902 --> 00:20:48,335
Where have you come from?

173
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,839
What difference does it make?

174
00:20:59,948 --> 00:21:01,575
I am from Mumbai.

175
00:21:05,587 --> 00:21:09,079
If you read Mumbai's
newspapers daily...

176
00:21:09,892 --> 00:21:11,519
...you will see that
all of them write...

177
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:15,321
'Bhiku Mhatre is in jail. Bhiku
Mhatre will not be granted bail.'

178
00:21:15,431 --> 00:21:18,025
'Bhiku Mhatre is a very
big criminal, a gangster...

179
00:21:18,367 --> 00:21:20,301
Hey, listen! Take the cigarette.

180
00:21:20,769 --> 00:21:22,134
Bring some water.

181
00:21:23,939 --> 00:21:26,533
Everybody is frightened!...
They are on tenterhooks!

182
00:21:27,142 --> 00:21:28,837
- Do you read the newspapers?
- No.

183
00:21:29,445 --> 00:21:31,743
No wonder you don't know about me.

184
00:21:33,515 --> 00:21:34,675
Tell me something.

185
00:21:37,619 --> 00:21:40,087
You were new here
and you fought with me.

186
00:21:40,756 --> 00:21:43,987
Do you know I have a gang here?

187
00:21:44,359 --> 00:21:47,851
I could have finished you off
if I wanted to. Weren't you scared?

188
00:21:48,497 --> 00:21:49,964
I do not fear death.

189
00:21:55,504 --> 00:21:56,766
Eat.

190
00:22:00,242 --> 00:22:03,575
Jagga - the man from Hyderabad.

191
00:22:04,379 --> 00:22:07,644
That bloody rascal is Guru's man.

192
00:22:07,716 --> 00:22:09,650
- Who's Guru?
- Guru Narayan.

193
00:22:09,685 --> 00:22:11,880
Both of us used to work for Bhau.

194
00:22:12,821 --> 00:22:14,379
How are you?

195
00:22:15,591 --> 00:22:19,186
One is fined up to Rs.2,000-3,000
if caught in a case like yours.

196
00:22:19,228 --> 00:22:20,525
How did you land in jail then?

197
00:22:20,562 --> 00:22:22,587
I didn't have money.

198
00:22:35,444 --> 00:22:37,344
Where is your family?

199
00:22:40,282 --> 00:22:42,512
I mean, your parents and siblings.

200
00:22:43,185 --> 00:22:44,550
I don't know.

201
00:22:45,087 --> 00:22:45,883
Meaning?

202
00:22:48,891 --> 00:22:50,916
Perhaps, they are dead.

203
00:23:29,865 --> 00:23:32,959
My child is singing! My baby!

204
00:23:33,735 --> 00:23:36,431
She sings well, doesn't she?

205
00:23:37,105 --> 00:23:38,936
Are you in a foul mood yet?
Come on, smile.

206
00:23:39,341 --> 00:23:41,901
What do I do by smiling?
Expose my teeth?!

207
00:23:42,844 --> 00:23:46,041
One can never know with you. You're
in sometimes, and out at other times!

208
00:23:46,214 --> 00:23:48,307
When I'm in jail,
she is distressed.

209
00:23:48,617 --> 00:23:51,051
When I come out, she runs away
from me. Ask her what she wants.

210
00:23:51,086 --> 00:23:54,920
Remain inside! At least, I get
to meet you when you're in jail!

211
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:56,657
He just disappears when he comes out!

212
00:23:57,259 --> 00:24:00,319
If she is made a judge, she will
sentence me to life imprisonment!

213
00:24:00,362 --> 00:24:02,728
Ask her... Look at the judge!

214
00:24:02,965 --> 00:24:05,934
That's enough.
When will you come home?

215
00:24:06,201 --> 00:24:08,601
Why are you asking me? Ask him.

216
00:24:08,804 --> 00:24:11,432
- When will he come home?
- It will take 3 weeks.

217
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,001
- 3 weeks? Why will
it take 3 weeks?

218
00:24:14,242 --> 00:24:16,267
- It will take that long.
- For what?

219
00:24:16,645 --> 00:24:20,172
Am I an attorney or are you?
Why did you study law?

220
00:24:20,482 --> 00:24:22,006
Will you let me rot here?

221
00:24:22,184 --> 00:24:27,087
Listen. The film industry has been
shaken up with Chedha's death.

222
00:24:27,456 --> 00:24:29,515
The media has given it
tremendous publicity.

223
00:24:29,791 --> 00:24:32,988
We will have to take every
step very cautiously now.

224
00:24:33,328 --> 00:24:35,990
A lot of things have
to be managed, Bhiku.

225
00:24:37,866 --> 00:24:40,334
I think Guru is responsible
for all this.

226
00:24:41,903 --> 00:24:43,427
He instigated Chedha against me.

227
00:24:44,306 --> 00:24:45,568
- Guru Narayan?
- Yes.

228
00:24:48,644 --> 00:24:49,542
No.

229
00:24:50,445 --> 00:24:52,470
I know him inside out.

230
00:24:52,881 --> 00:24:54,143
It's time up.

231
00:24:54,983 --> 00:24:58,043
Have some concern.
My wife is here to meet me.

232
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:01,351
- But they will reprimand me.
- Okay, I'll come.

233
00:25:02,524 --> 00:25:03,991
Mule, listen to me.

234
00:25:06,061 --> 00:25:08,859
There's a boy here.
We have become thick pals.

235
00:25:09,297 --> 00:25:11,527
- He's a good boy.
- Is he useful?

236
00:25:11,733 --> 00:25:15,396
- Name?
- Satya... His name is Satya.

237
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:28,211
You will be released tomorrow.
I have made all the arrangements.

238
00:25:28,784 --> 00:25:30,809
I have spoken to my attorney Mule.

239
00:25:31,086 --> 00:25:32,417
He will take you to Uncle Kallu.

240
00:25:32,554 --> 00:25:35,352
Your accommodation and food
will be taken care of.

241
00:25:42,831 --> 00:25:43,923
Watch your step.

242
00:25:54,976 --> 00:25:57,206
What's the matter?
You appear very happy today.

243
00:25:57,446 --> 00:26:00,415
I gave vent to my desires
at a downtown brothel!

244
00:26:00,615 --> 00:26:02,674
You ought to go
to a more decent place!

245
00:26:03,285 --> 00:26:07,722
Have you ever tried Shabu?
A lotus blooms even in muck!

246
00:26:07,956 --> 00:26:09,321
Hey, take care of him!

247
00:26:09,357 --> 00:26:15,353
I have a desire in life. I want
to see you smile just once in life!

248
00:26:16,364 --> 00:26:17,854
Don't even try!

249
00:26:19,501 --> 00:26:21,435
Coming from the downtown brothel?

250
00:26:21,603 --> 00:26:24,902
- Have you ever tried Shabu?
- She is just perfect!

251
00:26:26,441 --> 00:26:29,672
I am feeling very light.

252
00:26:32,114 --> 00:26:36,608
Hello! Shall I tell you a joke?

253
00:26:37,285 --> 00:26:38,309
No joke.

254
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:43,890
What is the use of taking
Bhau's name? Even I know him.

255
00:26:44,493 --> 00:26:47,326
I have known him
since I was a child!

256
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:50,824
Explain to him.

257
00:26:51,399 --> 00:26:53,867
The more courteously a business
is conducted, the better it is!

258
00:26:54,136 --> 00:26:56,297
Explain to him.

259
00:26:57,239 --> 00:26:59,173
Just try Shabu.

260
00:26:59,941 --> 00:27:01,932
Hello! How are you?

261
00:27:14,122 --> 00:27:17,023
He is Satya.
Bhiku had spoken about him.

262
00:27:17,292 --> 00:27:18,919
Oh yes! Sit.

263
00:27:21,496 --> 00:27:25,432
How are things in jail?
Is Bhiku all right?

264
00:27:25,967 --> 00:27:31,906
After all, he's Bhiku! Put him
in any place and he loves it!

265
00:27:34,309 --> 00:27:35,241
- Malhotra is here.
- Who?

266
00:27:35,277 --> 00:27:36,266
The builder.

267
00:27:37,145 --> 00:27:40,137
- What does he say?
- He wants to discuss money with you.

268
00:27:42,284 --> 00:27:43,751
Send him in.

269
00:27:45,253 --> 00:27:45,912
- And listen.
- Yes?

270
00:27:46,521 --> 00:27:48,512
- Send Chander in.
- Okay.

271
00:27:49,124 --> 00:27:50,819
Go inside.

272
00:27:50,859 --> 00:27:53,089
Where is Chander?

273
00:27:53,161 --> 00:27:55,186
He has gone out.

274
00:27:56,598 --> 00:27:58,657
- Sit.
- I am Malhotra, the builder.

275
00:27:58,733 --> 00:28:00,758
I know. What's it?

276
00:28:00,802 --> 00:28:03,100
Troubles have increased these days.

277
00:28:03,138 --> 00:28:07,074
There are no buyers
and the rates have also fallen.

278
00:28:07,242 --> 00:28:08,539
Go on.

279
00:28:11,513 --> 00:28:11,774
Thinking about profit
is being far-fetched.

280
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:14,007
How much loss have you incurred?

281
00:28:15,317 --> 00:28:18,912
You ask for 40%, there are no
buyers, the rates have fallen...

282
00:28:19,154 --> 00:28:23,454
You have incurred a loss
of 18.5 million, haven't you?

283
00:28:25,026 --> 00:28:29,690
If there's no buyer for 3 months,
then you'll face a loss of 35 million.

284
00:28:29,798 --> 00:28:31,459
You...

285
00:28:31,499 --> 00:28:36,994
And I also know that your building
in Parel is fully booked.

286
00:28:37,505 --> 00:28:41,202
How much did you earn there?
150 million, right?

287
00:28:41,243 --> 00:28:43,575
No. The profit apparently...

288
00:28:43,712 --> 00:28:45,942
Do you think we are blockheads?

289
00:28:45,981 --> 00:28:49,144
That people here
are ignorant fools?!

290
00:28:49,451 --> 00:28:52,443
Now, shall I give you
an account of the cement?

291
00:28:52,587 --> 00:28:54,851
No. Within some days, I will...

292
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:57,151
I've been hearing this
since many days!

293
00:28:57,392 --> 00:28:59,451
Just give me one date now!

294
00:29:01,329 --> 00:29:05,095
How many days do you need?
A week? 10 days?

295
00:29:06,134 --> 00:29:09,900
I will give the money
within 10 days.

296
00:29:10,939 --> 00:29:13,430
I will not phone after 10 days.

297
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:16,802
Get going.

298
00:29:21,549 --> 00:29:22,675
Did you ask for me?

299
00:29:23,184 --> 00:29:28,952
His name is Satya. Take the key
and show him the house on the lane.

300
00:29:29,391 --> 00:29:30,289
Come on.

301
00:29:30,926 --> 00:29:32,518
My name is
Chander Krishnakant Khote.

302
00:29:33,295 --> 00:29:36,992
Earlier, the boys of this street
would call me Fatso Chandu.

303
00:29:37,499 --> 00:29:40,161
Then Bhikubhai asked me not
to take all this lying down.

304
00:29:40,201 --> 00:29:45,332
And I taught all of them a lesson!
They now call me Chanderbhai!

305
00:29:45,607 --> 00:29:48,167
Stop here... Come on, buddy.

306
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:50,102
Umbrella, open sesame!

307
00:29:50,979 --> 00:29:54,210
Keep the change and get going.

308
00:29:55,116 --> 00:29:59,109
Come on. This is our area,
so stay here without fear.

309
00:30:00,855 --> 00:30:03,517
The building is a bit old.

310
00:30:03,925 --> 00:30:08,191
It was built before Independence.
But your house is superb. Come on.

311
00:30:08,663 --> 00:30:13,157
It's a little crowded, but
that's needed in our profession.

312
00:30:13,601 --> 00:30:16,570
Else, we'll be in a real fix
if there are ever any problems!

313
00:30:17,973 --> 00:30:20,567
Come on. Do you know
what happened last month?

314
00:30:20,809 --> 00:30:24,142
I finished off two people
in the next lane.

315
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:27,845
I have Bhikubhai's patronage.

316
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:32,150
He has given me a pager, a
mobile phone and a revolver as well!

317
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:33,644
Bhikubhai favours me a lot.

318
00:30:33,922 --> 00:30:35,787
Here is your palace.

319
00:30:37,625 --> 00:30:40,253
Look! It's absolutely magnificent!

320
00:30:40,762 --> 00:30:45,131
It's a superb house!
Stay here without any fear.

321
00:30:45,633 --> 00:30:50,593
Yes, it's small but there's a dearth
of space in Mumbai. Am I right?

322
00:30:51,306 --> 00:30:52,773
Stay here peacefully!

323
00:30:53,675 --> 00:30:58,738
Get girls and make merry, okay?

324
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:02,707
If the neighbours say anything,
then tell me.

325
00:31:03,118 --> 00:31:05,586
I will slice them apart.

326
00:31:06,788 --> 00:31:09,348
And listen. You have
Bhikubhai's patronage.

327
00:31:09,791 --> 00:31:12,351
So live here peacefully. You have
been given such a superb house.

328
00:31:12,627 --> 00:31:15,994
There's a TV, a fridge and
...even a God!

329
00:31:16,831 --> 00:31:19,391
Do you believe in God?

330
00:31:20,635 --> 00:31:21,602
No.

331
00:31:52,901 --> 00:31:54,368
My name is Vidya.

332
00:31:58,506 --> 00:32:01,475
I live in the house opposite.

333
00:32:02,377 --> 00:32:04,242
I think there's something
wrong with the fuse.

334
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:07,510
Do you know how to repair it?

335
00:32:07,549 --> 00:32:09,540
- Which one is yours?
- This one.

336
00:32:14,222 --> 00:32:16,554
This is fine. Perhaps, there's
something wrong with the main switch.

337
00:32:18,426 --> 00:32:20,758
What's wrong, mother?

338
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:23,957
Tell me, where has he fallen?

339
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:27,591
Father, are you hurt?
Are you all right?

340
00:32:28,703 --> 00:32:31,934
How often have I asked you
not to shout? I feel terrified.

341
00:32:33,975 --> 00:32:36,068
Mother, he is our new neighbour.

342
00:32:36,411 --> 00:32:38,402
He has come to stay
in the house opposite.

343
00:32:44,586 --> 00:32:47,020
He's asking you to come inside.

344
00:32:47,388 --> 00:32:48,446
No. I'll come some other time.

345
00:32:48,623 --> 00:32:50,853
When you go to someone's house
for the first time...

346
00:32:51,126 --> 00:32:52,718
...you don't just
go away like this.

347
00:33:02,904 --> 00:33:07,068
He's asking if you have come
to live in the house opposite.

348
00:33:08,409 --> 00:33:09,239
Yes.

349
00:33:10,345 --> 00:33:12,245
- What's your name?
- Satya.

350
00:33:13,248 --> 00:33:15,216
- Are you a family man?
- Pardon?

351
00:33:15,984 --> 00:33:18,748
I mean, are you married,
do you have children...

352
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,088
Goodness me, mother! Now, don't
ask him his complete life story!

353
00:33:24,125 --> 00:33:25,092
Yes.

354
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:27,018
- Will you have some tea?
- No.

355
00:33:27,061 --> 00:33:29,256
I'll prepare it soon, please have it.

356
00:33:29,297 --> 00:33:32,095
No, some other time.
I'll take your leave now.

357
00:33:36,404 --> 00:33:38,838
Do you know Bhiku Mhatre?

358
00:33:38,873 --> 00:33:39,635
Who's Bhiku?

359
00:33:41,876 --> 00:33:43,366
He's sitting there.

360
00:33:43,945 --> 00:33:45,207
No, I don't know.

361
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,046
You are lying!

362
00:33:53,154 --> 00:33:55,782
If Bhiku Mhatre was not there,
then who paid you the contract money?!

363
00:33:55,823 --> 00:33:57,381
I don't know. I got a phone call.

364
00:33:57,425 --> 00:33:59,188
- From where?
- From Dubai.

365
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:01,826
- Who had phoned from Dubai?
- I don't know.

366
00:34:01,863 --> 00:34:03,228
Who had phoned from Dubai!

367
00:34:03,264 --> 00:34:05,732
I told you I do not know.

368
00:34:05,767 --> 00:34:07,701
We are hired contract killers.

369
00:34:07,735 --> 00:34:10,966
I was told to go to Borivili after
the job was done but I got caught.

370
00:38:24,258 --> 00:38:28,422
Bloody fool, why did you
throw the bottle down?!

371
00:38:28,963 --> 00:38:31,955
What will you do if it
pierces somebody's foot?

372
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:35,294
Hey, I didn't throw it,
it slipped.

373
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:38,571
Indeed! The fool can't digest
alcohol but he keeps drinking!

374
00:38:38,973 --> 00:38:40,702
Drink less.

375
00:38:41,175 --> 00:38:43,871
Everybody go to sleep.

376
00:38:44,612 --> 00:38:46,580
I'm leaving now.

377
00:38:47,114 --> 00:38:50,948
Where are you going?
Let's have a small peg each.

378
00:38:52,253 --> 00:38:53,447
Look, Uncle Kallu...

379
00:38:53,721 --> 00:38:58,215
...I've had so much to drink that my
cigarette has bent and become a pipe!

380
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:01,055
And you ask me to have
another small peg!

381
00:39:01,362 --> 00:39:02,852
- Shall I make a small peg?
- No.

382
00:39:03,164 --> 00:39:06,099
- A small one?
- I have a hearing at Court tomorrow.

383
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:10,737
Why do you have to go to Court?
Bhiku has already been released.

384
00:39:11,239 --> 00:39:16,336
- Yes, but I have another case.
- Whose?

385
00:39:17,545 --> 00:39:18,637
He is Bhau's...

386
00:39:19,013 --> 00:39:21,811
Let it be. I'll give you another.

387
00:39:22,517 --> 00:39:27,921
It's one of Bhau's men's case.
Tomorrow is the final hearing.

388
00:39:28,422 --> 00:39:31,448
So I thought I'd go there.

389
00:39:31,726 --> 00:39:33,489
- Then go.
- I'll leave now.

390
00:39:33,528 --> 00:39:35,496
Hey listen! Come here.

391
00:39:37,098 --> 00:39:39,430
You danced very well.

392
00:39:45,706 --> 00:39:49,005
I really enjoyed.

393
00:39:49,110 --> 00:39:52,375
Please explain to Bhiku.

394
00:39:52,413 --> 00:39:53,311
What?

395
00:39:54,081 --> 00:39:59,018
His temper will prove
to be detrimental.

396
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:03,154
I have explained to him so often.
He does not listen, what can I do?

397
00:40:03,357 --> 00:40:06,952
What to do?
How much do I explain?

398
00:40:07,461 --> 00:40:10,021
It's not like before these days.

399
00:40:10,565 --> 00:40:14,399
The police make arrests
at any time.

400
00:40:15,069 --> 00:40:18,095
And people like us just
sit helplessly in Court.

401
00:40:19,607 --> 00:40:24,704
This is nothing new. The
politicians are the biggest crooks.

402
00:40:24,845 --> 00:40:28,838
The country's law and order...
I'd say, the country is damned!

403
00:40:35,556 --> 00:40:38,548
He's sleeping... sleep.

404
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:41,394
I'll take your leave now.

405
00:40:47,268 --> 00:40:51,102
Then I told the director that
he must give a job to this boy...

406
00:40:51,138 --> 00:40:52,469
...as the boy respects me a lot.

407
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:55,234
The bloody director used to
think that he is very smart.

408
00:40:55,309 --> 00:40:58,608
He refused and I placed
a gun on his temple.

409
00:40:58,913 --> 00:41:02,041
And he took the boy for
not just one but three films!

410
00:41:04,151 --> 00:41:04,947
Take this.

411
00:41:05,152 --> 00:41:05,914
What's this?

412
00:41:06,387 --> 00:41:07,979
Open it and see.

413
00:41:13,127 --> 00:41:14,025
What's this?

414
00:41:14,829 --> 00:41:18,026
You have joined my profession.
So you will need it.

415
00:41:19,133 --> 00:41:20,964
But I don't know how to use it.

416
00:41:21,435 --> 00:41:23,369
You don't have to contest
in a competition.

417
00:41:23,938 --> 00:41:25,565
Do you have to win the first prize?

418
00:41:25,973 --> 00:41:28,703
In our profession, you have to place
it two inches away from the head.

419
00:41:29,276 --> 00:41:31,540
After that... boom!
...he's finished!

420
00:41:31,812 --> 00:41:35,839
It's real smooth!
It's German made. Keep it.

421
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:47,993
I inquired.

422
00:41:49,397 --> 00:41:52,924
He's inside... Jagga.

423
00:41:58,205 --> 00:42:02,141
You've got to do it
if you have to!

424
00:43:29,530 --> 00:43:31,191
He's Satya.

425
00:43:31,332 --> 00:43:34,927
Where have you been
since morning, huh?!

426
00:43:35,302 --> 00:43:37,236
Boy! She is angry!

427
00:43:37,505 --> 00:43:39,735
Where have you... You've had
liquor, haven't you?

428
00:43:39,774 --> 00:43:41,765
Fool! You've made merry
and come, huh?!

429
00:43:41,942 --> 00:43:45,036
What are you doing! I've been freed
from jail after so long, so smile!

430
00:43:45,246 --> 00:43:47,043
You have done me no favour!

431
00:43:47,281 --> 00:43:49,249
Where have you been since morning?

432
00:43:49,416 --> 00:43:50,405
Stop it.

433
00:43:50,718 --> 00:43:53,619
I've been waiting for you since so
long. The kids have gone to sleep!

434
00:43:53,821 --> 00:43:55,584
- Okay. Stop...
- I haven't eaten since morning!

435
00:43:55,890 --> 00:43:57,790
- Stop crying.
- I don't know if he's dead or alive!

436
00:43:58,392 --> 00:44:00,952
I said, be quiet!
Look, my friend is here.

437
00:44:01,195 --> 00:44:03,425
Your friend is here, right?
Then go with him!

438
00:44:03,597 --> 00:44:06,623
Take him! ...There is no need
for you to come home!

439
00:44:06,867 --> 00:44:08,926
I asked you to be quiet!...
Stop it!

440
00:44:09,904 --> 00:44:12,134
That's enough!

441
00:44:15,676 --> 00:44:18,110
You keep nagging!

442
00:44:22,616 --> 00:44:27,246
This is a marital fight. Please
leave, there's going to be a war here.

443
00:44:27,955 --> 00:44:29,855
Okay? Take the car.

444
00:44:33,227 --> 00:44:34,854
I've sent him away.

445
00:44:44,872 --> 00:44:46,897
You were talking to me rudely
in front of him...

446
00:44:53,314 --> 00:44:55,077
- You slapped me?
- Yes, I did!

447
00:44:55,482 --> 00:44:57,109
I'll hit you!

448
00:44:57,818 --> 00:44:59,718
Hey!

449
00:45:03,324 --> 00:45:06,054
- Why do you trouble me?
- That's enough.

450
00:45:07,161 --> 00:45:10,688
What are you doing! ...I have
returned after so many days.

451
00:45:17,938 --> 00:45:21,237
- You look good when angry.
- Shut up, you fool!

452
00:45:27,448 --> 00:45:28,676
Will I get some work?

453
00:45:31,986 --> 00:45:33,681
He has slashed my face!

454
00:45:33,854 --> 00:45:35,651
- I'll kill him!
- You hit Jaggabhai's man!

455
00:45:36,123 --> 00:45:38,990
Don't spare him!
...Lift your head.

456
00:45:43,530 --> 00:45:45,088
Indict the scoundrel
for supplying girls!

457
00:45:45,432 --> 00:45:47,400
I stay in the house opposite.

458
00:45:48,102 --> 00:45:50,161
Everybody gets a chance!

459
00:47:34,141 --> 00:47:35,540
- Who is it?
- This is Vidya.

460
00:47:35,943 --> 00:47:37,342
The door is open.

461
00:47:40,647 --> 00:47:43,241
Mother has sent you
God's offerings.

462
00:47:44,785 --> 00:47:47,083
Your room is nice.

463
00:47:47,955 --> 00:47:50,423
At least, the sky
is visible from here.

464
00:47:50,958 --> 00:47:53,984
From our house, the sky means
the high-rise building opposite.

465
00:47:54,661 --> 00:47:58,290
We were going to buy this house.
We had even spoken to the agent.

466
00:47:58,899 --> 00:48:01,868
We then learnt that somebody
had already bought this house.

467
00:48:02,503 --> 00:48:04,494
- You must have bought it, right?
- Yes.

468
00:48:04,538 --> 00:48:05,869
Why did you take so long to come?

469
00:48:05,906 --> 00:48:09,000
I am not from here.
So I took some time.

470
00:48:09,043 --> 00:48:10,772
That's why you took so long.

471
00:48:11,645 --> 00:48:12,907
I'll leave.

472
00:48:13,547 --> 00:48:14,411
This...

473
00:48:15,249 --> 00:48:16,682
It's all for you.

474
00:48:36,770 --> 00:48:37,930
Come down.

475
00:48:39,039 --> 00:48:40,438
I'll be back soon, father.

476
00:48:41,241 --> 00:48:43,106
- Are you going to work?
- Yes.

477
00:48:43,143 --> 00:48:45,634
- Where do you work?
- At Hotel Good Luck.

478
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:48,045
- Where's that?
- At Tardeo.

479
00:48:49,116 --> 00:48:51,812
- What do you do?
- Me? I am a singer.

480
00:48:52,252 --> 00:48:54,584
I mean I am still struggling.

481
00:49:00,194 --> 00:49:01,218
Who's she?

482
00:49:01,261 --> 00:49:03,889
I don't know
but she sure is some dame!

483
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:07,894
What's this, Satya?

484
00:49:08,635 --> 00:49:10,398
What do you mean, Bhikubhai?

485
00:49:11,071 --> 00:49:14,370
Entire Mumbai is reeling under the
blast, but Satya has become too fast!

486
00:49:15,776 --> 00:49:18,074
- Who's that girl?
- Let's go.

487
00:49:19,012 --> 00:49:22,209
I cannot make it in the morning.
I have work to do.

488
00:49:22,249 --> 00:49:24,547
Why didn't you tell me
in the morning?

489
00:49:24,718 --> 00:49:28,484
You keep a religious ritual without
asking me and then order me to come!

490
00:49:28,522 --> 00:49:30,922
Am I sitting idle?!

491
00:49:31,758 --> 00:49:33,157
Give the phone to Sony.

492
00:49:34,161 --> 00:49:38,029
This is daddy speaking, my darling.
Are you studying English?

493
00:49:38,132 --> 00:49:39,258
- Greetings.
- Sit.

494
00:49:39,333 --> 00:49:45,329
Daddy will come home in the evening.
It's business time now, okay?

495
00:49:45,939 --> 00:49:46,701
Sit.

496
00:49:48,008 --> 00:49:51,307
- Money?
- It's in the car, I'll get it.

497
00:49:51,378 --> 00:49:52,970
Go ahead!

498
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:01,444
What's wrong?

499
00:50:02,856 --> 00:50:05,324
I remembered a joke.
Listen to it.

500
00:50:06,593 --> 00:50:09,084
There was a woman who
had two paramours.

501
00:50:09,396 --> 00:50:10,294
Ram and Shyam.

502
00:50:10,964 --> 00:50:13,865
Do you know what happened once?
Both of them were making merry.

503
00:50:14,268 --> 00:50:15,758
Her husband happened to come then.

504
00:50:16,136 --> 00:50:17,694
He searched everywhere.

505
00:50:17,938 --> 00:50:22,466
On seeing her husband, Ram climbed
the fan and Shyam hid below the bed.

506
00:50:23,143 --> 00:50:26,135
Her husband searched everywhere.
There was nobody at home.

507
00:50:26,647 --> 00:50:28,638
So he felt very sorry.

508
00:50:28,949 --> 00:50:34,683
He apologized to his wife and asked
her if he could buy her a fridge.

509
00:50:35,222 --> 00:50:37,690
His wife refused and said
that Ram would buy her one.

510
00:50:38,325 --> 00:50:40,623
He then asked if he
could buy her a VCR.

511
00:50:41,094 --> 00:50:43,221
His wife refused and said
that Ram would buy her one.

512
00:50:43,530 --> 00:50:45,157
'Can I buy you a TV? '

513
00:50:45,232 --> 00:50:48,360
'No. Ram will buy me one.'
Ram jumped down and said...

514
00:50:48,402 --> 00:50:50,893
'You tramp! If Ram is going
to give you everything...

515
00:50:50,938 --> 00:50:53,600
...then will Shyam
take you for free?!

516
00:53:46,913 --> 00:53:50,007
Leave me!
- No, Bhiku!

517
00:53:50,417 --> 00:53:54,251
No, Bhiku! No!!

518
00:53:54,388 --> 00:53:57,789
Look, after all, the police
is meant for the public.

519
00:54:16,443 --> 00:54:18,934
There's pressure from all sides.

520
00:54:19,446 --> 00:54:24,383
The press is also after us.
They are printing everywhere...

521
00:54:27,888 --> 00:54:29,617
Shootouts are rampant in the open!

522
00:54:31,558 --> 00:54:33,389
What do I answer my superiors?

523
00:54:34,728 --> 00:54:39,256
And arrest all the suspects!

524
00:54:39,599 --> 00:54:41,328
How will that help, sir?

525
00:54:42,402 --> 00:54:45,462
We will arrest them and some lawyer
will have them released on bail.

526
00:54:46,306 --> 00:54:49,969
There is only one solution.
Just kill them.

527
00:54:53,613 --> 00:54:55,843
Encounters are not a solution.

528
00:54:58,385 --> 00:55:01,081
You are not a roadside ruffian.

529
00:55:09,496 --> 00:55:14,331
The problem is not of
law and order, but of education.

530
00:55:14,935 --> 00:55:17,597
Ours is a huge country
with a very vast population...

531
00:55:17,838 --> 00:55:19,829
...but the literacy level
is so low!

532
00:55:24,277 --> 00:55:27,769
The problem will get solved
on its own then.

533
00:55:42,462 --> 00:55:48,890
Pain can be tolerated to a
certain extent, but not beyond that.

534
00:55:49,703 --> 00:55:53,764
You know you will divulge.
Tell me his name.

535
00:55:55,876 --> 00:55:57,104
His name.

536
00:56:11,925 --> 00:56:15,486
I ask for the last time.
Will you tell us his name or not?

537
00:56:16,863 --> 00:56:19,229
Will you or won't you?!

538
00:56:25,372 --> 00:56:26,703
Not that way.

539
00:56:27,841 --> 00:56:30,332
Tear him apart.
He will understand then!

540
00:56:30,377 --> 00:56:31,969
Shall I pierce it in his eye?

541
00:56:32,012 --> 00:56:37,712
No. Put it in the scoundrel's
nose and remove it from his eye!

542
00:56:38,752 --> 00:56:41,152
You had come to kill me, huh?

543
00:56:42,923 --> 00:56:44,151
Look here.

544
00:56:44,991 --> 00:56:49,087
Who sent you? Else, I'll
pierce this in your eye!

545
00:56:49,796 --> 00:56:54,233
Tell me, who sent you? Malhotra?!

546
00:56:54,968 --> 00:56:59,428
He is not Malhotra's man.

547
00:57:07,314 --> 00:57:08,246
Hey!

548
00:57:10,350 --> 00:57:12,011
Heard that?

549
00:57:13,053 --> 00:57:14,953
- Bloody scoundrel!
- Guru Narayan!

550
00:57:16,056 --> 00:57:18,251
We have been fooled!

551
00:57:19,159 --> 00:57:25,530
Hey, you are very sensible! What
had happened to you, to your brains?!

552
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:28,830
Swine!

553
00:57:29,135 --> 00:57:31,399
Listen! Go and tell him...

554
00:57:31,871 --> 00:57:35,068
...that I'll barge into
his house and kill him!

555
00:57:35,475 --> 00:57:38,911
If you want to kill him,
what's the need to say so?

556
00:57:40,113 --> 00:57:41,171
Meaning?

557
00:57:41,648 --> 00:57:44,082
Guru Narayan should be killed
in one shot...

558
00:57:44,884 --> 00:57:47,785
...without saying
or explaining anything.

559
00:57:48,054 --> 00:57:52,718
Satya is right. The swine should
be eliminated in that manner!

560
00:57:53,393 --> 00:57:55,725
The bloody fool
has become too smart!

561
00:57:59,232 --> 00:58:02,099
Your heartthrob.

562
00:58:10,844 --> 00:58:11,674
I'll be back soon.

563
00:58:16,549 --> 00:58:20,679
Phone and find out where
that bloody Guru Narayan is.

564
00:58:21,554 --> 00:58:22,578
All right.

565
00:58:25,892 --> 00:58:28,019
Chander, who is that girl?

566
00:58:28,662 --> 00:58:32,189
She's Satya's heartthrob.
She stays opposite his house.

567
00:58:32,732 --> 00:58:34,427
What a piece she is!

568
00:58:34,868 --> 00:58:37,393
The other day when we had
taken the van, we saw her.

569
00:58:37,504 --> 00:58:39,904
They were whispering to each other.

570
00:58:40,340 --> 00:58:43,605
- There is something cooking!
- Look at what's happened.

571
00:58:43,843 --> 00:58:46,607
He has barely come to the city
and has already wooed a girl!

572
00:58:46,646 --> 00:58:48,375
- Yes.
- Why are you jealous?

573
00:58:48,815 --> 00:58:50,908
Even you can follow his footsteps.

574
00:58:51,217 --> 00:58:55,313
Listen, you should woo
a girl just like her.

575
00:58:55,922 --> 00:58:59,517
But she will not get wooed
if your face appears so crestfallen.

576
00:58:59,659 --> 00:59:01,456
Open up a little!

577
00:59:05,932 --> 00:59:09,424
She's nice. Is she your girlfriend?

578
00:59:11,371 --> 00:59:14,863
What a girl you have wooed!
Your matter is fixed!

579
00:59:14,941 --> 00:59:16,875
I don't wish to talk about it.

580
00:59:16,910 --> 00:59:19,879
There's no need
to talk, understand?!

581
00:59:19,913 --> 00:59:22,575
Didn't you hear what he said?!

582
00:59:28,088 --> 00:59:31,080
Yes... Okay.

583
00:59:31,825 --> 00:59:33,349
Guru is in Dubai.

584
00:59:35,428 --> 00:59:36,417
Now what?

585
00:59:36,463 --> 00:59:37,430
What now?

586
00:59:39,599 --> 00:59:40,827
We will wait.

587
00:59:41,534 --> 00:59:44,594
But if we set him free,
the swine will divulge everything.

588
00:59:49,109 --> 00:59:50,576
Tell me beforehand!

589
00:59:59,652 --> 01:00:01,745
Bapu, dispose off the body.

590
01:00:02,188 --> 01:00:05,055
And don't leave it outside the
gutter, like you did the last time.

591
01:00:09,229 --> 01:00:11,424
- Is the matter serious?
- Which matter?

592
01:00:11,965 --> 01:00:13,159
The one concerning the girl outside.

593
01:00:13,566 --> 01:00:14,931
No, it's nothing like that.

594
01:00:15,735 --> 01:00:19,227
Really? Then why did you
get angry? They were only joking.

595
01:00:19,572 --> 01:00:22,666
Why should you speak
like that about anyone?

596
01:00:23,076 --> 01:00:24,805
About anyone!

597
01:00:26,813 --> 01:00:31,079
Look into my eyes and speak to me.
Come on, talk to me.

598
01:00:31,518 --> 01:00:32,951
You love her, don't you?

599
01:00:33,453 --> 01:00:35,421
- No!
- Does she love you then?

600
01:00:37,357 --> 01:00:38,881
Answer truthfully.

601
01:00:39,692 --> 01:00:41,216
Come off it! I've just met her!

602
01:00:44,631 --> 01:00:46,462
Tell me about it.

603
01:00:47,133 --> 01:00:50,466
- She is a friend.
- And what do I mean to you?

604
01:00:50,837 --> 01:00:54,273
I know it all, understand?
You cannot hide it from me.

605
01:00:55,308 --> 01:00:57,902
Tell me something.
Why did you run to meet her?

606
01:01:01,014 --> 01:01:02,379
Now, forget it!

607
01:01:05,685 --> 01:01:09,587
Have you seen your face?
You are blushing!

608
01:01:14,427 --> 01:01:15,553
Shall I say something?

609
01:01:16,729 --> 01:01:18,219
The girl is nice.

610
01:01:25,638 --> 01:01:28,402
But, Sir, I have even
learnt classical singing.

611
01:01:29,175 --> 01:01:30,437
For 4-5 years.

612
01:01:31,110 --> 01:01:33,476
Even my father used
to play the sitar.

613
01:01:34,981 --> 01:01:38,246
So, if you would give me
a chance to sing, then...

614
01:01:47,994 --> 01:01:49,120
Fantastic!

615
01:01:51,497 --> 01:01:54,762
Many girls like you come to me.

616
01:01:56,302 --> 01:01:58,429
All of them want to
become playback singers.

617
01:01:58,872 --> 01:02:00,305
I can give a chance.

618
01:02:01,174 --> 01:02:03,335
But why should I
give you this chance?

619
01:02:06,980 --> 01:02:12,816
Sir, only if you give me
a chance to sing once...

620
01:02:12,852 --> 01:02:16,618
...can you decide whether
I possess the talent or not.

621
01:02:16,656 --> 01:02:19,853
Everybody is talented.
Even I am.

622
01:02:20,460 --> 01:02:22,291
The question is not of talent...

623
01:02:22,695 --> 01:02:26,461
...but of what else you can
give me other than that?

624
01:02:26,633 --> 01:02:28,658
My guru would always say...

625
01:02:31,905 --> 01:02:36,467
He'd always say, in order to gain
something, you have to give something.

626
01:02:37,343 --> 01:02:38,503
Understand?

627
01:02:39,279 --> 01:02:41,747
The producer is here to meet you.

628
01:02:42,582 --> 01:02:44,812
Make him feel at home.
I'll be there soon.

629
01:02:45,885 --> 01:02:50,879
Keep meeting me. I'll see
what I can do for you.

630
01:02:51,157 --> 01:02:52,590
Okay.

631
01:02:52,625 --> 01:02:54,115
Do meet me.

632
01:02:58,531 --> 01:02:59,896
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

633
01:03:01,134 --> 01:03:03,568
You are very beautiful!

634
01:03:20,153 --> 01:03:22,849
You're back, my dear?
How was your day?

635
01:03:23,356 --> 01:03:25,824
Did the music director
listen to your cassette?

636
01:03:25,858 --> 01:03:28,725
- Has father taken his medicines?
- Yes. I'll be back in a jiffy.

637
01:03:33,166 --> 01:03:35,930
No, father. Nothing was fruitful.

638
01:03:41,140 --> 01:03:44,837
I'm not dejected, I'm smiling.

639
01:03:47,847 --> 01:03:50,213
Vidya, a man brought the cooking
gas cylinder in the afternoon.

640
01:03:50,249 --> 01:03:52,843
So I borrowed money from Satya
and gave it to him.

641
01:03:52,885 --> 01:03:56,412
Repay Satya Rs.200.

642
01:03:56,923 --> 01:04:00,256
Rs. 150 for the cylinder
and Rs.50 which I spent.

643
01:04:01,594 --> 01:04:03,255
- Have the sweet dish.
- Sweet dish?

644
01:04:03,863 --> 01:04:07,822
Why did you prepare it, mother?
You know we don't have money!

645
01:04:08,067 --> 01:04:09,967
It's your birthday today.

646
01:04:10,303 --> 01:04:13,170
You're the limit!

647
01:04:13,439 --> 01:04:15,066
You know we don't have money!

648
01:04:15,108 --> 01:04:18,077
What was the need to borrow money
from people and prepare a sweet dish?!

649
01:04:18,111 --> 01:04:20,170
Just because it's my birthday...

650
01:04:33,993 --> 01:04:35,790
I'm eating it now.

651
01:04:36,896 --> 01:04:38,864
And it's delicious too.

652
01:04:51,310 --> 01:04:54,905
You're here, and I was
looking out for you downstairs.

653
01:05:06,459 --> 01:05:07,619
Actually...

654
01:05:08,528 --> 01:05:11,520
...I went to meet a music director.

655
01:05:13,099 --> 01:05:17,866
The types of people that
exist in this world, and...

656
01:05:18,304 --> 01:05:21,796
...the loose manner
in which they speak!

657
01:05:22,975 --> 01:05:25,034
To gain something,
you have to lose something!

658
01:05:27,547 --> 01:05:32,041
Sometimes, I feel that things
like talent just do not exist!

659
01:05:32,085 --> 01:05:35,248
They are only spoken words!

660
01:05:36,155 --> 01:05:39,318
And I don't understand
what to say to such people.

661
01:05:39,859 --> 01:05:41,827
What do I answer?!

662
01:05:42,895 --> 01:05:46,331
I can't even mention
all this to my poor parents.

663
01:05:47,333 --> 01:05:49,096
As they are already worried.

664
01:05:50,169 --> 01:05:53,400
That their daughter earns
a livelihood all by herself.

665
01:05:53,906 --> 01:05:57,501
That her earnings don't suffice...
I wonder what they keep thinking!

666
01:05:59,312 --> 01:06:01,712
You may explain to them often but...

667
01:06:02,815 --> 01:06:05,943
Oh! I came to return your money.

668
01:06:06,018 --> 01:06:10,318
I have only Rs. 170.
I'll repay Rs.30 later.

669
01:06:10,356 --> 01:06:11,948
No, I don't need the money.

670
01:06:12,024 --> 01:06:14,356
- Please take it.
- I'll take it later.

671
01:06:14,393 --> 01:06:15,155
No, please.

672
01:06:44,824 --> 01:06:46,724
This is Satya speaking.

673
01:06:47,093 --> 01:06:49,960
Do you know the
music director Runu Sagar?

674
01:07:14,687 --> 01:07:15,517
Who's speaking?

675
01:07:16,289 --> 01:07:18,780
- A girl had come yesterday.
- Who?!

676
01:07:20,459 --> 01:07:23,326
- A girl had come to sing yesterday.
- So?

677
01:07:23,963 --> 01:07:26,295
- Give only her a chance to sing.
- What!

678
01:07:27,133 --> 01:07:30,102
If you value your life,
only give her a chance.

679
01:07:30,136 --> 01:07:32,104
Hey! Stop talking nonsense,
you drunkard!

680
01:07:51,357 --> 01:07:55,088
You are spared this time. The next
time, the target will be your skull!

681
01:08:30,196 --> 01:08:32,221
Excuse me, where does
Ms. Vidya stay?

682
01:08:32,265 --> 01:08:33,630
- Who?
- Ms. Vidya.

683
01:08:33,766 --> 01:08:35,028
I don't know.

684
01:08:37,637 --> 01:08:41,437
Where does Ms. Vidya stay?
The one who sings.

685
01:08:42,241 --> 01:08:44,175
- On the second floor.
- On the second floor?

686
01:08:48,648 --> 01:08:50,809
Is Ms. Vidya here?

687
01:08:51,717 --> 01:08:53,810
- One minute... Vidya!
- Yes, mother?

688
01:08:53,853 --> 01:08:55,787
Somebody is here to see you.

689
01:08:59,191 --> 01:09:01,819
- Sir, you here?!
- Hello.

690
01:09:02,094 --> 01:09:05,655
Please come inside...
Sir, you...

691
01:09:06,432 --> 01:09:08,627
Father, he is Mr. Runu Sagar.

692
01:09:09,869 --> 01:09:12,167
Hello... no, thanks.

693
01:09:12,204 --> 01:09:13,899
- What brings you here?
- Well, actually...

694
01:09:13,973 --> 01:09:18,410
...I kept pondering over your voice
all night and decided that...

695
01:09:18,444 --> 01:09:20,969
...you will sing the song
which will be recorded tomorrow.

696
01:09:21,013 --> 01:09:23,038
- Me?!
- The recording is at 9 a. M tomorrow.

697
01:09:23,182 --> 01:09:24,945
- Please do come to Famous Studios.
- Me, sir?!

698
01:09:25,151 --> 01:09:26,311
You...

699
01:09:26,585 --> 01:09:31,352
- Please have some coffee.
- No. At the dot of 9 a.m. Tomorrow.

700
01:09:31,691 --> 01:09:34,785
- Please be there.
- But at least have some tea...

701
01:09:35,094 --> 01:09:36,652
There's no need.

702
01:09:37,363 --> 01:09:39,490
- It'll take just two minutes.
- At the dot of 9 a.m. Tomorrow.

703
01:09:39,532 --> 01:09:42,092
- Why are you coming along?
- I'll order for a cold drink.

704
01:09:42,134 --> 01:09:43,761
At this rate, you will
reach the Studio with me!

705
01:09:43,803 --> 01:09:46,135
It isn't so. I'll order
for a cold drink, sir.

706
01:09:46,205 --> 01:09:48,230
- At the dot of 9 a.m. Tomorrow.
- Please, Sir!

707
01:09:55,414 --> 01:09:58,781
Your job's done. Don't worry, okay?

708
01:10:00,353 --> 01:10:05,222
The night's threats have worked
wonders. He's reached her house!

709
01:10:05,291 --> 01:10:07,350
- Chander, give it to me.
- Speak to Bapu.

710
01:10:08,027 --> 01:10:10,825
Satya, the work's done.

711
01:10:11,297 --> 01:10:16,564
My friend, Razhak, is the
assistant of that film.

712
01:10:16,936 --> 01:10:19,404
He mentioned that the dwarf
is scared to death!

713
01:10:19,705 --> 01:10:23,607
He's suffering from diarrhea
since the time he received the call!

714
01:10:25,511 --> 01:10:28,708
He said, "Call that girl and
let her only sing the song!"

715
01:10:28,748 --> 01:10:32,309
He said that she had a melodious
voice which would be a great success!

716
01:10:32,585 --> 01:10:35,383
He said that henceforth, he'd
let her only sing all the film songs.

717
01:10:35,421 --> 01:10:36,445
I'm speaking the truth.

718
01:10:36,489 --> 01:10:39,890
- Listen, ask him to call Bhiku.
- Is Bhikubhai there?

719
01:10:40,359 --> 01:10:41,917
Uncle Kallu wants to speak to him.

720
01:10:42,261 --> 01:10:44,661
Bhikubhai, speak to Uncle Kallu.

721
01:10:46,499 --> 01:10:47,466
Yes, Bhiku?

722
01:10:48,501 --> 01:10:50,560
Hey, listen.

723
01:10:51,170 --> 01:10:56,130
After finishing off Malhotra,
the builders are scampering here!

724
01:10:56,976 --> 01:10:59,308
Bloody Gidwani was here
a while back.

725
01:10:59,345 --> 01:11:02,542
He said that I should take the
money right now but reduce the amount.

726
01:11:02,848 --> 01:11:05,043
We will not spare them.

727
01:11:05,284 --> 01:11:09,812
Ask them to increase the amount if
they want their lives to be spared.

728
01:11:11,824 --> 01:11:14,691
- We should not increase the amount.
- Why not?

729
01:11:14,927 --> 01:11:16,588
Suppose, they refuse, then?

730
01:11:16,629 --> 01:11:19,063
We will eliminate
the scoundrels one by one!

731
01:11:19,098 --> 01:11:22,761
This is business. We stand to gain
with their fear, not their death.

732
01:11:35,681 --> 01:11:38,775
Come up... come up soon!

733
01:11:43,255 --> 01:11:49,125
Satya, do you know who
had come today? Runu Sagar!

734
01:11:49,595 --> 01:11:50,027
Why?

735
01:11:50,563 --> 01:11:55,466
He wants me to sing
for his new album. Me!

736
01:11:56,135 --> 01:11:59,104
I really can't believe it!

737
01:11:59,438 --> 01:12:06,537
Remember the things I spoke about
him yesterday, in a fit of fury?

738
01:12:06,979 --> 01:12:11,313
I just blabbered any nonsense.

739
01:12:12,117 --> 01:12:16,850
Sometimes, we do
misunderstand people, don't we?

740
01:12:17,356 --> 01:12:19,722
We make mistakes sometimes.

741
01:12:20,559 --> 01:12:23,392
But you're happy, aren't you?

742
01:12:23,462 --> 01:12:28,559
Happy? I am going crazy! I still
cannot believe it! Really!

743
01:12:28,601 --> 01:12:30,865
- There should be a party.
- Most certainly!

744
01:12:30,903 --> 01:12:31,198
Let's go?

745
01:12:31,237 --> 01:12:34,673
Let me get the money first.
I have to repay your Rs.30 also.

746
01:12:35,207 --> 01:12:38,176
I'll give a party now
and you can give one later, okay?

747
01:12:38,811 --> 01:12:40,972
Okay. Let's go.

748
01:12:49,388 --> 01:12:51,288
I'll tell you something interesting.

749
01:12:51,490 --> 01:12:53,355
It was during my wife's
birthday last year.

750
01:12:53,392 --> 01:12:56,418
I took her for a movie. What
was it? The one about lizards.

751
01:12:56,462 --> 01:12:59,022
- Lizards?
- Yes. It was a film about lizards.

752
01:12:59,064 --> 01:13:00,964
What was the name of the film?
...Yes! Jijamata Park.

753
01:13:01,567 --> 01:13:04,400
Jijamata Park, indeed!

754
01:13:08,107 --> 01:13:11,042
Yes! That's the film
I had taken her to.

755
01:13:11,176 --> 01:13:14,634
What happened there was, when a
small lizard pounced on a big one...

756
01:13:14,680 --> 01:13:16,648
...she held me tight!

757
01:13:18,183 --> 01:13:20,481
- I was scared.
- Indeed!

758
01:13:21,153 --> 01:13:23,212
- Have you seen the film?
- No, I have not.

759
01:13:23,455 --> 01:13:28,051
You haven't? What a dangerous story
and film it is! ...Take her for it.

760
01:13:28,093 --> 01:13:34,589
The face of the big lizard in
that film looked just like Bhau's!

761
01:13:36,035 --> 01:13:38,503
Who is Bhau?

762
01:13:39,371 --> 01:13:41,134
The Manager of our company.

763
01:13:42,374 --> 01:13:43,807
He's our Manager.

764
01:13:44,643 --> 01:13:47,840
His face is just like a bull's!
He devours everybody!

765
01:13:49,381 --> 01:13:52,612
- Do you watch a lot of films?
- No, we don't get the time.

766
01:13:53,352 --> 01:13:55,582
But I do watch a lot of television.

767
01:14:00,526 --> 01:14:02,153
'The Bold and the Beautiful.'

768
01:14:02,194 --> 01:14:05,186
Hey! Whom are you
spinning yarns to, huh?

769
01:14:05,497 --> 01:14:08,955
She watches the Marathi news
at 7 on the local channel!

770
01:14:09,001 --> 01:14:10,901
I switch on that for you!

771
01:14:13,305 --> 01:14:15,865
- What do you do?
- I sing.

772
01:14:15,941 --> 01:14:17,909
- What do you sing?
- She sings songs!

773
01:14:17,943 --> 01:14:19,535
- Which songs?
- What do you mean?

774
01:14:19,578 --> 01:14:22,046
She sings and earns money, just the
way you spend money by eating here!

775
01:14:22,748 --> 01:14:24,875
I spend money by eating?!

776
01:14:25,618 --> 01:14:27,552
That's how I run
the house, don't I?!

777
01:14:27,586 --> 01:14:29,884
- What are you doing!
- Put your leg down!

778
01:14:29,922 --> 01:14:31,822
Can you speak any nonsense just
because you've brought me out once?

779
01:14:32,157 --> 01:14:35,888
This is a public place.
Look, she's laughing!

780
01:14:35,961 --> 01:14:39,158
- Why are you laughing?!
- No, I am not.

781
01:14:45,604 --> 01:14:48,334
Love is fine. But what
do you mean by 'so much'?

782
01:14:48,507 --> 01:14:49,496
This!

783
01:14:49,908 --> 01:14:52,342
Not so little, but this much.

784
01:14:54,780 --> 01:14:57,476
We've been at each other's
necks since 10 years.

785
01:14:58,417 --> 01:15:00,442
- 12 years.
- The first two years...

786
01:15:00,519 --> 01:15:03,215
...you were only glued to me!
- Shameless man!

787
01:16:25,838 --> 01:16:26,964
What are you looking at?

788
01:16:27,606 --> 01:16:30,370
At how much happiness
you find in trivial things.

789
01:16:30,909 --> 01:16:31,807
Meaning?

790
01:16:32,411 --> 01:16:36,780
Eating 'batata wada',
the ocean, music... all of these.

791
01:16:37,916 --> 01:16:40,384
Yes. But then, that's life.

792
01:16:40,619 --> 01:16:43,087
I am experiencing it
for the first time.

793
01:20:35,287 --> 01:20:36,845
Yes, I have understood.

794
01:20:37,823 --> 01:20:42,783
It was Babu's phone. Guru Narayan
is coming by tomorrow's flight.

795
01:20:52,437 --> 01:20:53,631
Hold this.

796
01:20:56,074 --> 01:20:58,599
I had asked you to do one job and
you couldn't even do that properly!

797
01:20:58,810 --> 01:21:00,778
There was just one hitch, Gurubhai.
The rest was...

798
01:21:00,946 --> 01:21:01,970
Shut up! Let's go.

799
01:21:19,431 --> 01:21:23,834
They have left. It's a
white colour Ambassador car.

800
01:21:32,477 --> 01:21:35,344
But we did one good thing.
We had hired all the new boys.

801
01:21:35,380 --> 01:21:38,110
They think Malhotra is responsible.
What's the next course of action?

802
01:21:40,886 --> 01:21:45,050
Whoever he is, we must not wait any
longer. We must kill him immediately.

803
01:21:45,657 --> 01:21:49,093
Our car is parked on
the left side of the road.

804
01:21:49,394 --> 01:21:52,056
As soon as his car goes past ours,
attack his car near the next tree.

805
01:21:52,431 --> 01:21:54,194
I understand.

806
01:21:58,003 --> 01:21:59,061
Pass my revolver.

807
01:22:00,172 --> 01:22:03,198
Satya is in the van.
Be ready.

808
01:22:03,475 --> 01:22:04,965
Yes, Bhikubhai, I'm ready.

809
01:22:05,010 --> 01:22:08,173
Overtake him near the drain pipe...
hey, sit inside! ...sit inside!!

810
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:10,905
- Bhikubhai, uncle has called.
- What does he say?

811
01:22:11,183 --> 01:22:13,151
He says not to eliminate Guru.

812
01:22:13,752 --> 01:22:15,811
What the hell is this?!

813
01:22:20,292 --> 01:22:21,691
Bhau said so?

814
01:22:22,327 --> 01:22:23,123
But...

815
01:22:25,730 --> 01:22:28,221
Abort the plan!

816
01:22:28,667 --> 01:22:30,658
Didn't you hear what
I said? Plan canceled!

817
01:22:30,735 --> 01:22:32,726
Bhikubhai, there's the car.

818
01:22:45,117 --> 01:22:47,142
What's the matter?

819
01:22:47,586 --> 01:22:50,419
Uncle had called. Bhau has
said not to eliminate him.

820
01:22:50,689 --> 01:22:52,486
What does Bhau
have to do with this?

821
01:22:52,691 --> 01:22:56,752
He has called us. Let's find out...
All of you, go to uncle. Let's go.

822
01:23:20,719 --> 01:23:22,710
Have all of you gone crazy?

823
01:23:23,555 --> 01:23:25,182
Guru started it.

824
01:23:25,790 --> 01:23:28,588
So? You should ask me.

825
01:23:30,629 --> 01:23:32,654
You have become a
big underworld kingpin!

826
01:23:32,731 --> 01:23:34,528
So you feel ashamed to ask Bhau!

827
01:23:35,433 --> 01:23:38,266
- It isn't so, Bhau.
- Then?

828
01:23:38,970 --> 01:23:42,030
All of you think that
it's a child's play!

829
01:23:46,711 --> 01:23:48,303
Hey, phone Guru.

830
01:23:50,515 --> 01:23:54,315
Guru is going beyond limits!
I want to eliminate him!

831
01:23:54,352 --> 01:23:56,183
- So, do you want to do that now?!
- Then when do I do it?!

832
01:23:56,221 --> 01:23:57,688
Stop blabbering!

833
01:23:59,057 --> 01:24:00,922
Elections are round the corner.

834
01:24:01,693 --> 01:24:06,357
You'd have killed him, and his
men in Dubai would have retaliated!

835
01:24:06,398 --> 01:24:08,263
My honour would be in shambles!

836
01:24:10,335 --> 01:24:13,827
'Bhau's man involved in a gang war! '

837
01:24:14,439 --> 01:24:16,873
Bloody swine, do you want me
to lose the election?!

838
01:24:19,344 --> 01:24:21,835
- What's happening?
- The line is busy.

839
01:24:23,048 --> 01:24:26,381
I used to think
that uncle was sensible!

840
01:24:26,484 --> 01:24:29,453
- It's not his fault.
- Even you should not make blunders!

841
01:24:30,155 --> 01:24:31,588
You should not!

842
01:24:32,691 --> 01:24:36,320
You are my younger brother.
Do not be so stupid again!

843
01:24:37,128 --> 01:24:40,154
You should ask me before
taking any action, understand?

844
01:24:40,832 --> 01:24:44,632
One needs to be alive
to be able to ask.

845
01:24:51,009 --> 01:24:52,636
- Hello, Bhau.
- Hey, Guru!

846
01:24:53,144 --> 01:24:57,046
What am I hearing? Why are you
fighting amongst yourselves?

847
01:24:57,115 --> 01:25:00,107
- Bhiku has started it.
- He says that you have!

848
01:25:00,151 --> 01:25:02,676
- Bhiku is lying!
- Listen to me, Guru.

849
01:25:03,021 --> 01:25:06,684
I respect you a lot. I hold
no grudge against Bhiku either.

850
01:25:06,891 --> 01:25:12,591
But I definitely want Satya,
the one who killed my Jagga!

851
01:25:13,632 --> 01:25:18,092
All right. But I don't want you
to have any problems with Bhiku.

852
01:25:18,136 --> 01:25:20,969
Understand? I'll cut the line now.

853
01:25:23,141 --> 01:25:25,871
Guru has agreed. You may leave now.

854
01:25:26,444 --> 01:25:29,379
But don't do a thing!
Understand? Nothing!

855
01:25:30,315 --> 01:25:31,509
Go.

856
01:25:43,128 --> 01:25:45,221
Bhiku, I'll see you later.

857
01:25:57,575 --> 01:25:59,805
What kind of a boy is Satya?

858
01:26:01,146 --> 01:26:06,083
He's sharp witted and uses his head.
Our Bhiku has great regard for him.

859
01:26:06,785 --> 01:26:09,185
He is quite popular in the gang.

860
01:26:12,090 --> 01:26:14,684
He will not switch loyalties.
That's guaranteed.

861
01:26:14,726 --> 01:26:18,093
I have made a fool of myself
in front of everybody!

862
01:26:18,630 --> 01:26:23,090
Guru Narayan came to kill me,
but Bhiku has to remain silent!

863
01:26:23,201 --> 01:26:24,964
Because Bhau has said so!

864
01:26:26,071 --> 01:26:29,268
The boys will ridicule me!

865
01:26:29,307 --> 01:26:34,609
They will say,
"Hey, Bhiku, you're chicken!"

866
01:26:35,580 --> 01:26:38,378
I have to only do this
because Bhau has asked me to!

867
01:26:39,317 --> 01:26:41,148
Then, why should you listen to Bhau?

868
01:26:44,222 --> 01:26:48,488
Bhau is only concerned
about his interests.

869
01:26:51,463 --> 01:26:53,693
He isn't concerned about anybody.

870
01:26:55,066 --> 01:26:58,126
He needs you
only to win the election.

871
01:26:58,236 --> 01:27:02,730
If he is thinking about his
interests, why can't you do the same?

872
01:27:03,875 --> 01:27:09,370
Do you think Guru Narayan
will heed Bhau and keep quiet?

873
01:27:10,849 --> 01:27:16,344
Bhiku, in our profession,
the one who attacks first, wins.

874
01:28:08,373 --> 01:28:09,135
Move aside!

875
01:28:09,941 --> 01:28:11,374
Catch the scoundrel!

876
01:28:34,866 --> 01:28:36,390
Look there, he's escaping!

877
01:29:28,052 --> 01:29:31,613
Don't kill me, Bhiku!
Don't shoot me!

878
01:29:32,824 --> 01:29:34,519
Hey, Bhiku, don't kill!

879
01:29:34,592 --> 01:29:36,822
Your wife considers me her brother!

880
01:29:36,861 --> 01:29:39,625
Is that why you
had come to kill me?!

881
01:29:39,664 --> 01:29:40,631
Kill him!

882
01:29:40,665 --> 01:29:44,533
Is that why you had
come to shoot me?!

883
01:29:44,569 --> 01:29:45,593
Bhiku, shoot!

884
01:29:45,670 --> 01:29:47,695
You had come to kill me, right?!

885
01:29:47,872 --> 01:29:49,066
Bhiku, shoot!

886
01:29:49,440 --> 01:29:51,408
He calls me his friend!

887
01:29:51,776 --> 01:29:52,936
I had considered him my friend.

888
01:29:53,344 --> 01:29:55,539
I've helped him
in so many crises!

889
01:29:55,847 --> 01:29:58,611
When a bullet was fired, I went
in the front and saved him!

890
01:29:59,117 --> 01:30:02,484
My wife would tie him a 'rakhi'. My
kids would call this jerk their uncle!

891
01:30:02,987 --> 01:30:06,479
He even ate at my place!

892
01:30:11,763 --> 01:30:17,224
Look! Do you understand who
Bhiku Mhatre is? Do you?!

893
01:30:18,136 --> 01:30:20,969
- Let's go, Bhiku!
- Bloody swine, do you understand?!

894
01:30:35,520 --> 01:30:38,387
What have you done! Bhau had said,
Guru wouldn't interfere with you!

895
01:30:38,456 --> 01:30:41,448
And had asked you not to mess with
him, but you killed Guru Narayan!

896
01:30:41,826 --> 01:30:43,760
Bhau is only bothered
about his interests!

897
01:30:44,128 --> 01:30:47,529
Implying, you hold no regard
for what Bhau says?

898
01:30:48,399 --> 01:30:51,368
Who trusts his word?
Tell me, does Guru believe him?

899
01:30:51,636 --> 01:30:53,160
Which world are you in!

900
01:30:53,905 --> 01:30:56,305
You should have compromised.

901
01:30:59,043 --> 01:31:00,840
You've had drinks together!

902
01:31:01,379 --> 01:31:03,540
You've made merry
with the same girl!

903
01:31:04,215 --> 01:31:08,311
How did Guru Narayan manage to
become such a big thorn in the flesh?

904
01:31:09,320 --> 01:31:11,311
Before remembering the past...

905
01:31:11,422 --> 01:31:14,323
Look, don't speak about the past!
Let bygones be bygones!

906
01:31:15,193 --> 01:31:17,684
Remember, I had saved him from a
bullet in Nasik and got shot myself?

907
01:31:17,729 --> 01:31:23,065
Shall I show you the scar on my
back?! ...The fool argues with me!

908
01:31:25,603 --> 01:31:28,128
Had I not done this, you'd have
been arguing about me...

909
01:31:28,172 --> 01:31:31,198
...in Guru Narayan's house!
...explain to him!

910
01:31:32,777 --> 01:31:34,574
Nobody belongs to anyone here.

911
01:31:35,079 --> 01:31:40,915
One of us would be here.
He's dead and I'm here. That's it!

912
01:31:47,492 --> 01:31:50,461
Yes, Vidya, I'll be there.

913
01:31:51,896 --> 01:31:56,765
Bhiku, you don't
know our profession.

914
01:31:56,801 --> 01:31:58,701
Try to understand it!

915
01:31:59,404 --> 01:32:03,670
If one man is finished in our
business... then so is everybody else!

916
01:32:28,833 --> 01:32:31,563
BULLETS FIRED
IN THE MIDST OF CHILDREN

917
01:32:31,602 --> 01:32:33,570
Panic has spread among the public.

918
01:32:33,604 --> 01:32:37,802
And we have been evading the issue,
saying it's an underworld gang enmity.

919
01:32:41,345 --> 01:32:45,281
I totally disapprove of the
Commissioner's laid-back attitude.

920
01:32:45,783 --> 01:32:50,584
I feel he is unable to
do justice to his job.

921
01:32:58,429 --> 01:33:00,260
- One tomato soup.
- Yes, madam.

922
01:33:00,331 --> 01:33:03,095
- What will you have?
- Anything.

923
01:33:05,737 --> 01:33:07,170
And one 'anything'.

924
01:33:10,141 --> 01:33:12,974
- Make that two.
- Yes, madam.

925
01:33:17,215 --> 01:33:20,116
I'm sitting in front of you and you
are engrossed in reading the papers.

926
01:33:20,952 --> 01:33:22,476
Is it something very important?

927
01:33:22,620 --> 01:33:25,817
It's nothing more important
than you, it can never be.

928
01:33:29,961 --> 01:33:33,055
- You have never mentioned before.
- What?

929
01:33:33,598 --> 01:33:38,592
About yourself, where you
are from, about your family...

930
01:33:45,777 --> 01:33:46,903
What's wrong?

931
01:33:54,085 --> 01:33:59,455
I could never tell you...
I am an orphan.

932
01:34:01,259 --> 01:34:07,391
I never told you because I was
afraid of what you'd think about me.

933
01:34:13,838 --> 01:34:16,739
All these things
make no difference, Satya.

934
01:34:18,576 --> 01:34:20,237
I was only asking.

935
01:34:23,047 --> 01:34:25,481
I love you.

936
01:34:40,998 --> 01:34:43,762
What are you looking at?
Say something.

937
01:39:40,479 --> 01:39:44,745
You didn't find him? Then look
for him at Chunabatti and inform me!

938
01:39:46,318 --> 01:39:48,980
Hey! Where the hell were you?!

939
01:39:49,588 --> 01:39:51,783
- What's wrong?
- What's wrong!!

940
01:39:52,191 --> 01:39:55,217
We have been searching for this hero
like fools and he asks, what's wrong!

941
01:39:55,728 --> 01:39:57,195
Where were you?

942
01:39:57,563 --> 01:40:01,021
It's only a trivial matter!
I went to Khandala with Vidya.

943
01:40:01,500 --> 01:40:03,525
To Khandala?!

944
01:40:04,637 --> 01:40:08,334
We've been hunting for him like oafs
and where did he go? To Khandala!

945
01:40:08,607 --> 01:40:10,541
- Hey, do you want to die?
- But what is the matter?

946
01:40:10,576 --> 01:40:13,409
You know that Bhau is looking out
for you, don't you?

947
01:40:13,445 --> 01:40:14,776
Come off it,
I can look after myself!

948
01:40:14,813 --> 01:40:18,943
I know Bhau very well. If he is
silent, it doesn't mean he's idle!

949
01:40:18,984 --> 01:40:20,542
Or that he'll spare you!

950
01:40:20,686 --> 01:40:22,153
Listen to me intently!

951
01:40:22,187 --> 01:40:25,918
Henceforth, you will not go
anywhere without informing!

952
01:40:26,058 --> 01:40:28,526
This will not be repeated.
Forgive me. Okay?

953
01:40:28,627 --> 01:40:31,790
Forgive you! I've been making so
many calls, I've sent Babu to Kurla.

954
01:40:32,064 --> 01:40:35,124
Chander has been looking out
for you! I am your servant, right?!

955
01:40:35,167 --> 01:40:36,225
Forget it! I am sorry.

956
01:40:36,268 --> 01:40:39,669
Sorry, indeed! ...He went to
Khandala; next, he'll go to Dubai!

957
01:40:39,705 --> 01:40:41,696
I'm sorry.

958
01:40:42,541 --> 01:40:46,033
Bhiku, I had some work with you.

959
01:40:46,145 --> 01:40:46,873
Now what?

960
01:40:47,446 --> 01:40:50,506
I want to buy Vidya a gift.

961
01:40:51,283 --> 01:40:53,615
I don't quite understand
what to buy.

962
01:40:59,024 --> 01:41:03,051
Rascal! ...Just look
at this scoundrel!

963
01:41:03,962 --> 01:41:07,454
I have not gone home
to my wife since last 4 days!

964
01:41:07,700 --> 01:41:09,827
This hero comes, and what
does he tell me?!

965
01:41:10,102 --> 01:41:12,127
'Bhiku, I want to buy
my girlfriend a gift! '

966
01:41:12,671 --> 01:41:17,574
Your girlfriend is yours,
but my beloved wife is not my wife!

967
01:41:18,210 --> 01:41:23,807
Anyway, what will I buy? I went to
buy him a gift and I brought a comb!!

968
01:41:47,773 --> 01:41:50,071
- Bhikubhai!
- How are you?

969
01:41:50,542 --> 01:41:52,032
Hello, madam.

970
01:41:52,644 --> 01:41:55,579
If you had told me, I'd have
brought the whole shop to you!

971
01:41:56,215 --> 01:41:58,410
As well as the Mumbai Police!

972
01:41:58,884 --> 01:42:01,114
No way! Tell me,
what can I do for you?

973
01:42:01,353 --> 01:42:03,150
Not for me. He's my friend Satya.

974
01:42:03,322 --> 01:42:05,586
He wants to buy his girlfriend a
gift. Do you have anything suitable?

975
01:42:05,858 --> 01:42:07,325
I certainly do. Please come.

976
01:42:07,993 --> 01:42:08,891
Show it.

977
01:42:09,762 --> 01:42:12,560
- How will you know what to buy!
- Fine! You see.

978
01:42:12,598 --> 01:42:14,395
Show it to him... what will you buy?

979
01:42:14,833 --> 01:42:15,857
Anything.

980
01:42:15,934 --> 01:42:18,994
Don't you dare say this to her! She
will never see you again, understand?

981
01:42:19,037 --> 01:42:23,167
- You don't know what to buy!
- Apologies to her!

982
01:42:23,208 --> 01:42:24,641
Shall I show you
a new design of a ring?

983
01:42:24,676 --> 01:42:26,610
- Should he show it? Show it.
- How's her finger?

984
01:42:27,579 --> 01:42:28,375
It's nice.

985
01:42:28,881 --> 01:42:31,406
He is asking about
the size of her finger!

986
01:42:32,718 --> 01:42:36,586
- I don't know.
- You don't? Show my size.

987
01:42:36,789 --> 01:42:38,620
Give me size 13.

988
01:42:39,491 --> 01:42:41,118
Take, madam.

989
01:42:43,562 --> 01:42:45,427
- It's nice, isn't it?
- Yes.

990
01:42:45,631 --> 01:42:47,565
- How much is it for?
- Rs. 1,00,000 only.

991
01:42:48,567 --> 01:42:49,659
It's very expensive.

992
01:42:50,035 --> 01:42:52,731
Rascal, you love her and yet,
you ponder about the price. Keep it!

993
01:42:52,805 --> 01:42:54,136
No, I don't have so much money.

994
01:42:54,473 --> 01:42:57,067
- Why worry about cash? I'm here.
- No, Bhiku.

995
01:42:57,442 --> 01:43:00,309
Hey! Don't let money
come in between us.

996
01:43:00,813 --> 01:43:02,280
Pack it.

997
01:43:02,381 --> 01:43:03,678
Pack this.

998
01:43:06,451 --> 01:43:07,440
That's also nice.

999
01:43:07,519 --> 01:43:11,455
Listen... for how many years
have we been married?

1000
01:43:11,490 --> 01:43:12,388
- 12 years. Why?

1001
01:43:12,891 --> 01:43:17,021
Have you ever given me
a gift in these 12 years?

1002
01:43:17,563 --> 01:43:20,123
Aren't you ashamed? Don't you
ever think about your wife?!

1003
01:43:20,165 --> 01:43:21,792
- I have given you a gift.
- What?

1004
01:43:22,067 --> 01:43:24,627
Those two... children!

1005
01:43:28,640 --> 01:43:29,800
- Bhikubhai.
- Yes?

1006
01:43:30,108 --> 01:43:33,475
Even I have 4-5 girlfriends.
Shall I also have the gifts packed?

1007
01:43:36,715 --> 01:43:38,376
- Aren't you ashamed?
- Why?

1008
01:43:39,084 --> 01:43:41,848
You just don't work. You only
keep drinking beer all day!

1009
01:43:42,354 --> 01:43:44,185
And you expect me to buy
a gift for your girlfriend?!

1010
01:43:44,356 --> 01:43:46,847
But you don't give
me any work to do!

1011
01:43:47,326 --> 01:43:48,588
- Will you work?
- Yes.

1012
01:43:49,328 --> 01:43:50,590
You?

1013
01:43:51,763 --> 01:43:54,129
Shall I tell everybody about
what you did in Mittal's case?

1014
01:43:57,269 --> 01:43:57,997
Mittal's case?

1015
01:43:59,004 --> 01:44:01,768
We went to extort money from the
General Manager of Mittal Stores.

1016
01:44:02,174 --> 01:44:04,369
He started arguing, so a gun was
placed on his skull and he was shot.

1017
01:44:04,443 --> 01:44:06,843
Blood oozed out,
and this bloody fellow fainted!

1018
01:44:06,912 --> 01:44:10,473
We had to go to Poona but we had
to take him to a hospital instead!

1019
01:44:11,416 --> 01:44:13,179
But I was unwell.

1020
01:44:13,352 --> 01:44:15,286
Yes! You always fall ill just
before we have to eliminate somebody!

1021
01:44:15,387 --> 01:44:17,412
Take some pills!

1022
01:44:18,257 --> 01:44:20,122
Please give Bhikubhai's parcel soon.

1023
01:44:21,360 --> 01:44:22,327
Take, madam.

1024
01:44:23,795 --> 01:44:27,822
Yes, uncle? Do you know
what we are doing here?

1025
01:44:32,237 --> 01:44:33,636
I see.

1026
01:44:39,878 --> 01:44:41,140
All right.

1027
01:44:41,813 --> 01:44:45,909
- What's the matter?
- A new Commissioner is here.

1028
01:45:03,201 --> 01:45:06,034
I have been asked to
attend to a Press Conference.

1029
01:45:14,913 --> 01:45:18,110
I am very pleased with
this honour and occasion.

1030
01:45:18,850 --> 01:45:22,286
You may now ask me
any questions you please.

1031
01:45:22,321 --> 01:45:24,016
It is said that...

1032
01:45:24,056 --> 01:45:26,786
...you do not tolerate political
interference in police matters?

1033
01:45:26,992 --> 01:45:30,393
Due to that, you get transferred
from every place instantly?

1034
01:45:31,997 --> 01:45:35,455
What better way can there be
to travel across India?

1035
01:45:38,470 --> 01:45:43,203
Why do you think the previous
Commissioner was transferred?

1036
01:45:45,711 --> 01:45:47,406
You call it a routine transfer.

1037
01:45:47,546 --> 01:45:51,414
But he's got transferred to a police
training school! What would you...

1038
01:46:05,697 --> 01:46:07,528
- How many years?
- 6 years, Sir.

1039
01:46:10,902 --> 01:46:14,998
Bhiku Mhatre, Attorney Mule,
Uncle Kallu, Guru Narayan...

1040
01:46:15,173 --> 01:46:16,970
...are all birds
of the same feather.

1041
01:46:17,376 --> 01:46:21,506
All of them began their profession
under Bhau Thakurdas Jhavle.

1042
01:46:21,580 --> 01:46:25,846
But when Bhau entered politics,
this gang split into two factions.

1043
01:46:26,018 --> 01:46:28,680
The first faction
is the Mhatre gang.

1044
01:46:28,887 --> 01:46:31,879
Which consists of Bhiku Mhatre,
Attorney Mule, Uncle Kallu, etc.

1045
01:46:32,324 --> 01:46:34,690
The chief of the other faction
was Guru Narayan.

1046
01:46:34,926 --> 01:46:39,863
Guru's area consists of places near
Bhandup, Wadala and Antop Hill.

1047
01:46:40,232 --> 01:46:42,200
Their business is immoral traffic.

1048
01:46:42,401 --> 01:46:45,063
And Mhatre's area extends from
the Central side, Grant Road...

1049
01:46:45,237 --> 01:46:47,432
...Nepeansea Road right
up to Mohammad Ali Road.

1050
01:46:47,672 --> 01:46:52,405
Their business includes extortion,
film finance and gambling dens.

1051
01:46:52,944 --> 01:46:55,504
Both these factions never used
to interfere in each other's work.

1052
01:46:55,781 --> 01:47:01,481
But tension surfaced when Guru
began interfering in Mhatre's area.

1053
01:47:02,154 --> 01:47:03,815
Who is Satya?

1054
01:47:03,889 --> 01:47:06,585
Sir, we have not been able to
gather much information about him.

1055
01:47:06,925 --> 01:47:11,760
We only know that he had joined
Bhiku Mhatre's gang some months back.

1056
01:47:12,297 --> 01:47:14,390
He has risen to the top quite soon.

1057
01:47:17,436 --> 01:47:20,894
Inside information reveals that this
man operates Mhatre's gang nowadays.

1058
01:47:21,473 --> 01:47:25,773
Informers also say that he had
a hand in Guru Narayan's murder.

1059
01:47:29,114 --> 01:47:30,741
Hello.

1060
01:47:30,916 --> 01:47:32,281
Hey, Khandelkar, you?

1061
01:47:32,818 --> 01:47:36,618
I had forgotten that he had
also been transferred to Mumbai.

1062
01:47:37,222 --> 01:47:38,189
Please sit.

1063
01:47:39,458 --> 01:47:41,426
- How are you?
- The same as before.

1064
01:47:42,060 --> 01:47:44,585
Implying, you still
haven't found anybody?

1065
01:47:45,564 --> 01:47:48,499
Why do you ask that? Don't you
know he will feel shy?

1066
01:47:48,533 --> 01:47:51,400
It's better to feel shy
than to regret, isn't it?

1067
01:47:51,870 --> 01:47:54,600
It's your age to get married now.

1068
01:47:55,040 --> 01:47:57,634
Well, I'll get married
in a year or two.

1069
01:47:57,676 --> 01:48:00,201
Marriage isn't the same as duty,
that you need a time limit!

1070
01:48:00,345 --> 01:48:03,542
Don't even think about marriage
until you find a suitable match.

1071
01:48:04,049 --> 01:48:07,416
- Where's your daughter?
- She got admitted to school today.

1072
01:48:07,786 --> 01:48:10,016
She will return by noon.
You will be here, won't you?

1073
01:48:10,222 --> 01:48:12,315
- No, I have to leave.
- What's the hurry?

1074
01:48:12,524 --> 01:48:17,291
Eat and go. Wait here,
I'll go and prepare something.

1075
01:48:20,999 --> 01:48:23,524
It's good that Munni
got her admission soon.

1076
01:48:23,635 --> 01:48:26,502
What were you saying
about Guru Narayan's murder?

1077
01:48:27,005 --> 01:48:30,406
Sir, Guru Narayan was murdered
against Bhau's wishes.

1078
01:48:30,909 --> 01:48:34,538
This is going to lead to a big
gang war between Bhiku and Bhau.

1079
01:48:37,115 --> 01:48:39,743
It's good. Let them fight amongst
themselves and kill one another!

1080
01:48:39,818 --> 01:48:42,082
And the ones who remain,
we'll handle!

1081
01:48:42,120 --> 01:48:45,385
- Jyoti, have you put sugar?
- Yes, she has, Sir.

1082
01:48:55,033 --> 01:48:56,398
For me!

1083
01:48:58,303 --> 01:49:00,863
It's very beautiful!

1084
01:49:05,343 --> 01:49:05,900
But...

1085
01:49:09,147 --> 01:49:12,116
But, Satya, this is...

1086
01:49:13,885 --> 01:49:16,513
You are wondering where I got
so much money from, aren't you?

1087
01:49:17,789 --> 01:49:20,849
I had taken a loan from the company.
I will gradually repay them.

1088
01:49:22,260 --> 01:49:24,228
- But...
- Now don't tell me...

1089
01:49:24,262 --> 01:49:26,822
...like you did to mother that there
was no need to take a loan and buy it.

1090
01:49:27,365 --> 01:49:31,301
I only wanted to see the ring
around your finger, so I bought it.

1091
01:49:32,470 --> 01:49:34,097
You liked it, didn't you?

1092
01:49:39,211 --> 01:49:40,678
It's extremely beautiful.

1093
01:49:45,350 --> 01:49:46,817
Allow me.

1094
01:51:33,024 --> 01:51:35,754
It's good that he is no more.

1095
01:51:36,961 --> 01:51:39,327
This was inevitable.

1096
01:51:40,965 --> 01:51:45,425
How often had I wished
that this should happen!

1097
01:51:46,671 --> 01:51:50,607
Death was better than this life.

1098
01:51:53,044 --> 01:51:55,274
But he was still living.

1099
01:51:57,115 --> 01:52:00,949
Since 15 years, on that chair...

1100
01:52:08,026 --> 01:52:14,158
He used to sing so well, but he
was unable to speak even a word.

1101
01:52:14,999 --> 01:52:17,058
I've been trying to call you since
so long but you weren't answering.

1102
01:52:17,102 --> 01:52:17,864
What's the matter?

1103
01:52:19,270 --> 01:52:21,898
Bhikubhai has called you right now.
There's some problem about Bhau.

1104
01:52:25,343 --> 01:52:28,176
- How is Vidya's mother?
- She's fine.

1105
01:52:39,357 --> 01:52:40,255
What's the matter?

1106
01:52:42,727 --> 01:52:44,524
Mule says that Bhau wants to meet me.

1107
01:52:58,143 --> 01:52:59,405
Ask him to come here.

1108
01:53:45,957 --> 01:53:48,619
I have come here
to accept my mistake.

1109
01:53:53,331 --> 01:53:55,390
I have committed a folly.

1110
01:53:57,869 --> 01:54:01,202
That bloody Guru was a wretched
man; I failed to realize that.

1111
01:54:02,040 --> 01:54:03,064
What could I do?

1112
01:54:03,107 --> 01:54:06,372
Elections were round the corner.
I was surrounded by jerks!

1113
01:54:06,778 --> 01:54:08,439
I would listen to anybody.

1114
01:54:09,414 --> 01:54:13,180
It's good you finished off Guru.

1115
01:54:13,885 --> 01:54:18,879
Bhiku, whatever you have done,
does not distress me.

1116
01:54:20,325 --> 01:54:21,724
But beware.

1117
01:54:23,461 --> 01:54:27,192
There's a new Commissioner
in the city - Amod Shukla.

1118
01:54:28,266 --> 01:54:32,327
He will definitely
be after our blood.

1119
01:54:33,638 --> 01:54:38,974
We must not let him take
advantage of our internal fights.

1120
01:54:40,745 --> 01:54:41,803
No.

1121
01:54:42,380 --> 01:54:46,646
We are the mafia.
We ought to live like comrades.

1122
01:54:47,652 --> 01:54:50,621
Understand? Do you understand?!

1123
01:54:53,992 --> 01:54:57,393
You are my child,
a little child of mine!

1124
01:55:11,209 --> 01:55:16,044
You are a very sensible boy.
I am glad you are with Bhiku.

1125
01:55:19,284 --> 01:55:21,115
- Why are all of you standing?
- Bhau, sit here.

1126
01:55:21,419 --> 01:55:24,115
- Ask him to bring hot tea.
- No, Bhau, not there!

1127
01:55:24,656 --> 01:55:28,023
- Bhau, come here.
- That is your chair.

1128
01:55:29,327 --> 01:55:32,660
This fatso doesn't let anyone sit on
it; he tells me also to sit over here!

1129
01:55:34,365 --> 01:55:36,424
You give me your chair,
but would sit on mine?!

1130
01:55:38,670 --> 01:55:41,605
Bhau, I'll order for some champagne.
...go and bring some champagne.

1131
01:55:42,440 --> 01:55:44,305
Fetch some liquor.

1132
01:55:46,444 --> 01:55:48,207
Hey, Chander! Tell me.

1133
01:55:48,246 --> 01:55:50,737
- My sister is getting married.
- Then we will surely attend it!

1134
01:55:51,115 --> 01:55:52,514
Bhau, you must come.

1135
02:01:05,863 --> 02:01:08,093
Bhau has extended a hand
of friendship towards Bhiku.

1136
02:01:08,633 --> 02:01:11,227
And now, Bhiku Mhatre is
helping Bhau in the elections.

1137
02:01:11,802 --> 02:01:14,464
All the candidates contesting
against him have been threatened...

1138
02:01:14,705 --> 02:01:17,936
...by the underworld gang
to withdraw their nominations.

1139
02:01:18,776 --> 02:01:23,110
And we are helpless, as nobody
has lodged a formal complaint.

1140
02:01:23,381 --> 02:01:25,906
How will anybody do that?
Every person values his life.

1141
02:01:26,350 --> 02:01:30,411
Anyway, people believe in the
underworld gang more than the police.

1142
02:01:37,662 --> 02:01:41,393
I'll reach at the
dot of 8.30, Sir.

1143
02:01:44,068 --> 02:01:47,469
The corporate election candidates
have been threatened...

1144
02:01:47,705 --> 02:01:50,697
...and Bhau Thakurdas Jhavle
is the man behind this!

1145
02:01:51,442 --> 02:01:53,376
Yes, we have the information.

1146
02:01:53,511 --> 02:01:56,207
The police do have the information.

1147
02:01:56,647 --> 02:01:59,411
- Then what action have you taken?
- As of now, nothing.

1148
02:02:00,551 --> 02:02:04,009
Amazing! Hooliganism is rampant...

1149
02:02:04,055 --> 02:02:06,990
...and our police force is merely
watching the spectacle like fools!

1150
02:02:08,693 --> 02:02:11,457
I said that we have the
information but not the report.

1151
02:02:11,529 --> 02:02:14,828
Nobody has lodged a
written complaint against Bhau.

1152
02:02:14,865 --> 02:02:16,992
And you ask us what we are doing.

1153
02:02:23,007 --> 02:02:27,603
Arrest Bhau on a 'no ground' basis?
Then? We'll have to free him then!

1154
02:02:28,079 --> 02:02:32,072
As we have no evidence against him.
So why this farce of arresting him?

1155
02:02:32,750 --> 02:02:36,277
Mr. Amod, it is unbecoming
of you to use such words...

1156
02:02:39,857 --> 02:02:42,758
What happens is that we arrest them
and they get released later.

1157
02:02:43,094 --> 02:02:45,688
If they get arrested, then they
will operate from inside the jail.

1158
02:02:45,930 --> 02:02:48,831
And if they escape, they will
operate from abroad!

1159
02:02:48,866 --> 02:02:50,731
And we cannot do a thing!

1160
02:02:50,768 --> 02:02:53,635
The amount of money we spend
on their extradition...

1161
02:02:53,804 --> 02:02:55,795
...is not even asked
for extortion by them!

1162
02:02:56,440 --> 02:02:59,102
And then there are people
like Bhau who operate openly.

1163
02:02:59,443 --> 02:03:02,412
Because they know very well
how to break this system!

1164
02:03:03,314 --> 02:03:06,750
Sir, I think there is
no solution to this problem.

1165
02:03:13,090 --> 02:03:16,025
They can do anything because
they transgress the law.

1166
02:03:16,427 --> 02:03:19,692
And we cannot do a thing because
it is the same law which stops us!

1167
02:03:20,598 --> 02:03:25,661
I admit the law must have
bound your hands many a times.

1168
02:03:26,070 --> 02:03:28,300
But the fault does not
lie with the law.

1169
02:03:28,472 --> 02:03:31,168
The framework of
our democracy is such.

1170
02:03:31,375 --> 02:03:35,209
Democracy has given our citizens
some basic fundamental rights.

1171
02:03:35,513 --> 02:03:42,385
Men like Bhau violate these
rights and mock at democracy.

1172
02:03:43,120 --> 02:03:45,452
But it's the limit now!

1173
02:03:46,023 --> 02:03:49,584
Rampant squabbles,
hooliganism, threats...

1174
02:03:50,161 --> 02:03:51,958
The public is getting terrified now.

1175
02:03:52,463 --> 02:03:56,593
Of what use is the law
which cannot protect the citizens?

1176
02:03:57,301 --> 02:04:01,761
Mr. Commissioner, I give
you a free hand.

1177
02:04:02,506 --> 02:04:03,837
Do anything.

1178
02:06:36,227 --> 02:06:38,388
The police have shot Chander dead.

1179
02:06:47,972 --> 02:06:50,236
What are you doing?
Come here quickly.

1180
02:06:57,948 --> 02:06:59,210
What's the matter?

1181
02:07:02,620 --> 02:07:03,882
What's wrong?

1182
02:07:05,823 --> 02:07:07,518
My friend met with an accident.

1183
02:07:11,462 --> 02:07:12,895
Is he badly hurt?

1184
02:07:13,998 --> 02:07:15,192
He's dead.

1185
02:07:18,936 --> 02:07:21,029
You'll have to go, won't you?
I'll come right away.

1186
02:07:21,071 --> 02:07:22,834
No, I'll see you later.

1187
02:07:22,906 --> 02:07:26,307
- I'll leave in a jiffy.
- No. You go. I'll see you later.

1188
02:07:26,377 --> 02:07:27,401
Okay.

1189
02:07:36,453 --> 02:07:37,920
The bloody fool is dead!

1190
02:07:43,294 --> 02:07:45,319
What was the need to go there?

1191
02:07:46,664 --> 02:07:50,430
I had asked that swine
not to go there!

1192
02:07:51,635 --> 02:07:54,695
The bloody fool wanted to
be an underworld kingpin!

1193
02:07:55,039 --> 02:07:56,939
The kingpin Chander!

1194
02:07:57,708 --> 02:07:59,141
Bloody swine!

1195
02:08:00,110 --> 02:08:02,601
- What's the use now?
- The swine couldn't kill!

1196
02:08:02,713 --> 02:08:04,578
What's the use of
talking about it?

1197
02:08:05,516 --> 02:08:09,543
All day long, he'd say,
"Bhikubhai, listen to a joke!"

1198
02:08:11,055 --> 02:08:14,718
The rascal would just keep laughing!
He wouldn't listen to anybody!

1199
02:08:15,426 --> 02:08:18,623
- I met his mother two days back.
- Why do you just go on talking!

1200
02:08:19,163 --> 02:08:20,630
Why are you blabbering?!

1201
02:08:20,731 --> 02:08:24,223
'Give Rs.20-25 thousand. I've
seen a girl for him in Kolhapur.'

1202
02:08:24,368 --> 02:08:26,996
'Or he'll never settle down.
Please take care of him, Bhiku.'

1203
02:08:27,204 --> 02:08:29,331
- Stop it, Bhiku!
- What could I tell her?

1204
02:08:29,506 --> 02:08:30,973
- Stop it!
- He wouldn't heed Bhiku or his mama!

1205
02:08:31,008 --> 02:08:33,841
- Stop it!!
- Stop what?!

1206
02:08:35,212 --> 02:08:37,942
He had come to you, right?
Why didn't you stop him?

1207
02:08:37,981 --> 02:08:39,505
Scoundrel, why are you accusing me?!

1208
02:08:39,750 --> 02:08:43,811
Nobody means anything to you!
I don't mean a thing to you!

1209
02:08:43,854 --> 02:08:46,914
- All right, forgive me!
- He doesn't mean a thing!

1210
02:08:46,957 --> 02:08:50,825
- Bhiku, listen to me!
- Just keep making money!

1211
02:08:51,328 --> 02:08:53,922
They shot him on his temple and the
bullet came out from the other end!

1212
02:08:53,964 --> 02:08:56,330
- Wasn't he like my son?
- He was like your son indeed!

1213
02:08:59,069 --> 02:09:01,697
Why did the bloody fools
kill only him?

1214
02:09:02,606 --> 02:09:04,437
Because they are policemen.

1215
02:09:05,576 --> 02:09:08,909
Bhiku, they had no
other way of stopping us.

1216
02:09:09,446 --> 02:09:11,471
The government has given
them the liberty.

1217
02:09:12,116 --> 02:09:14,880
So they are using
our method to catch us.

1218
02:09:14,952 --> 02:09:17,853
They believe that they can
get away with anything.

1219
02:09:20,657 --> 02:09:24,718
They feel that all of us are
within the reach of the law.

1220
02:09:25,262 --> 02:09:28,925
We'll also show them that they
are not beyond our reach either!

1221
02:09:31,168 --> 02:09:35,696
What? What are
you trying to say?

1222
02:09:38,642 --> 02:09:40,803
We'll kill Amod Shukla.

1223
02:09:48,252 --> 02:09:49,913
Are you nuts, huh?!

1224
02:09:51,054 --> 02:09:53,784
Have you gone crazy?!

1225
02:09:54,925 --> 02:09:57,826
Kill Amod Shukla!...
How will we kill him?!

1226
02:09:58,662 --> 02:10:00,186
Tell me, how will we kill him?!

1227
02:10:00,230 --> 02:10:02,596
There will be police posted
in every nook and corner!

1228
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:05,127
Like termites on wood!

1229
02:10:05,803 --> 02:10:08,772
We'll kill Amod Shukla indeed!...
Tell me, how will we kill him?!

1230
02:10:09,206 --> 02:10:12,437
Killing him will be like killing
a brother of every policeman!

1231
02:10:12,509 --> 02:10:14,136
How will we kill him?!

1232
02:10:14,244 --> 02:10:17,771
Initially, they will be infuriated.
Then, they will understand.

1233
02:10:18,449 --> 02:10:21,350
If somebody can kill the brother
of a policeman today...

1234
02:10:22,152 --> 02:10:25,246
...then he can even kill
a policeman tomorrow!

1235
02:10:28,125 --> 02:10:31,856
Why should only
Amod Shukla be killed?

1236
02:10:32,396 --> 02:10:35,593
- We can kill anybody else!
- Who?

1237
02:10:47,778 --> 02:10:49,973
There is no other way out.

1238
02:10:50,948 --> 02:10:52,677
No other way.

1239
02:11:02,192 --> 02:11:05,719
All right. Do what you please.

1240
02:11:07,064 --> 02:11:11,694
But I'll tell you one thing. Do
not underestimate the police, okay?

1241
02:11:12,402 --> 02:11:15,064
I am not underestimating them.

1242
02:11:15,639 --> 02:11:19,507
We may or may not kill Amod Shukla
but they are bent on finishing us off.

1243
02:11:20,110 --> 02:11:24,444
If we just sit idle, they will
chase us like dogs and kill us.

1244
02:11:25,115 --> 02:11:30,018
They are after our blood
because we are not retaliating.

1245
02:11:30,988 --> 02:11:32,717
They perceive no danger.

1246
02:11:33,657 --> 02:11:35,420
By killing Amod Shukla,
fear will be instilled in them.

1247
02:11:36,593 --> 02:11:41,758
After that, any policeman will think
ten times before cracking down on us.

1248
02:11:42,566 --> 02:11:48,562
Uncle, Amod Shukla's death
could become a gift of life for us.

1249
02:11:57,548 --> 02:11:59,982
- The cops behaving as they please...
- It won't do!

1250
02:12:00,250 --> 02:12:02,514
- The hooliganism of the police...
- It won't do!

1251
02:12:02,886 --> 02:12:08,188
- Amod Shukla!
- Go back!

1252
02:12:08,492 --> 02:12:11,052
Due to the killings of two innocent
merchants yesterday by the police...

1253
02:12:11,094 --> 02:12:14,120
...fear has gripped
the citizens of Mumbai.

1254
02:12:14,398 --> 02:12:17,697
The deceased Bansilal and Haresh
Mehta were owners of a cloth shop.

1255
02:12:17,935 --> 02:12:19,903
They were returning home
after shutting their shop.

1256
02:12:19,937 --> 02:12:22,405
The police say that they felt
both of them were gangsters.

1257
02:12:22,606 --> 02:12:27,566
When asked why they did not
verify, the police had no reply.

1258
02:12:28,111 --> 02:12:31,239
This is Devnar in front of Mumbai
Mantralaya reporting for ZEE News.

1259
02:12:31,615 --> 02:12:33,446
Is this true?

1260
02:12:33,717 --> 02:12:36,379
Many questions were raised in the
Parliament about the startling event.

1261
02:12:36,620 --> 02:12:37,814
Yes, it is true.

1262
02:12:38,755 --> 02:12:43,522
The police have committed a folly.
But who doesn't make mistakes?

1263
02:12:44,261 --> 02:12:48,994
What could the cop do? Go up to the
car and ask for his identification?

1264
02:12:49,499 --> 02:12:50,864
Ask, where he stays
and where he's going?

1265
02:12:51,401 --> 02:12:54,859
Had there been no businessmen in the
car, 2 cops would've been dead today!

1266
02:12:55,439 --> 02:12:59,808
It's very easy to sit in the
drawing room and give an opinion.

1267
02:13:00,510 --> 02:13:03,377
But have you ever thought of the
conditions under which we work?

1268
02:13:05,182 --> 02:13:09,448
Give sympathy to the dead
and abuses to the police!

1269
02:13:09,486 --> 02:13:11,317
Then switch off the TV
and forget about it!

1270
02:13:12,255 --> 02:13:16,624
And if nothing happens, then
display placards of Human Rights!

1271
02:13:17,027 --> 02:13:20,793
Have you ever wondered,
where these people talking about...

1272
02:13:21,198 --> 02:13:23,291
...Human Rights disappear when the
mafia blatantly kills innocent people!

1273
02:13:23,433 --> 02:13:28,268
Nobody holds
placards then, saying...

1274
02:13:28,872 --> 02:13:31,136
Policemen are murderers, butchers!

1275
02:13:31,742 --> 02:13:34,973
Even a butcher slaughters a goat
only because people eat it!

1276
02:13:35,545 --> 02:13:37,240
Why do you point a finger
at the butcher?

1277
02:13:38,048 --> 02:13:41,575
And we do not enjoy slaying anybody!

1278
02:13:42,519 --> 02:13:46,421
We do not make criminals,
Jyoti, the system does.

1279
02:13:47,257 --> 02:13:51,990
Until the system gets rectified,
someone will have to clean this filth!

1280
02:13:52,896 --> 02:13:55,990
And today, under the prevailing
conditions, I am doing that job.

1281
02:14:01,238 --> 02:14:02,569
Khandelkar, listen...

1282
02:14:02,606 --> 02:14:04,904
...a religious gathering will be
held the day after tomorrow morning...

1283
02:14:21,858 --> 02:14:24,053
Where the hell are all of you!

1284
02:14:34,337 --> 02:14:35,861
Call the ambulance!

1285
02:14:43,380 --> 02:14:45,314
What are you doing! Look there!

1286
02:15:14,111 --> 02:15:16,705
The broad daylight murder
of Amod Shukla...

1287
02:15:16,980 --> 02:15:19,676
...had shaken the complete machinery
of the government to its roots.

1288
02:15:20,117 --> 02:15:22,585
The police too wanted
to seek vengeance.

1289
02:15:23,086 --> 02:15:25,748
The way in which they cracked down
on the underworld...

1290
02:15:26,189 --> 02:15:29,283
...the uproar created, the chaos
and shootouts that took place...

1291
02:15:29,693 --> 02:15:33,129
All this is the blackest chapter
in Mumbai's history of crime.

1292
02:15:33,764 --> 02:15:37,825
The city of Mumbai, gripped with
tension, looked like a police rule.

1293
02:15:38,535 --> 02:15:41,663
And the forthcoming election had
made the conditions even more serious.

1294
02:15:42,405 --> 02:15:44,532
Due to the prevalent danger, people
were beginning to lose faith...

1295
02:15:44,741 --> 02:15:48,768
...in the hollow system
and the nonplussed government.

1296
02:15:50,180 --> 02:15:53,240
Bhau Thakurdas Jhavle
took undue advantage of it.

1297
02:15:53,884 --> 02:15:56,114
The obsession of the cops to unearth
the gangsters gone underground...

1298
02:15:56,353 --> 02:16:00,119
victimized some
innocent people too.

1299
02:16:02,359 --> 02:16:04,122
The Human Rights Organizations
held many demonstrations...

1300
02:16:04,528 --> 02:16:08,020
...against the police atrocities
and demanded that the city be closed.

1301
02:16:08,999 --> 02:16:11,365
The police said
that this was baseless.

1302
02:16:12,035 --> 02:16:15,266
But eventually,
they had to step back.

1303
02:16:16,506 --> 02:16:19,703
At the same time, Bhau Thakurdas
Jhavle won the election...

1304
02:16:19,743 --> 02:16:22,769
...with a landslide majority.

1305
02:16:23,079 --> 02:16:27,345
Under such conditions, Satya went
to see a film with Vidya one day.

1306
02:16:37,327 --> 02:16:39,693
Looking at the massive crowd, I
thought we wouldn't get the tickets.

1307
02:16:40,230 --> 02:16:41,595
- I got them.
- Let's go?

1308
02:16:51,141 --> 02:16:53,507
There are also some
informers amongst them, Sir.

1309
02:16:54,077 --> 02:16:57,103
Begin a full scale checking
of the village from tomorrow.

1310
02:16:58,982 --> 02:17:00,244
If need be.

1311
02:17:01,218 --> 02:17:06,417
Sir, this... and that...
are two uneven paths.

1312
02:17:06,957 --> 02:17:10,256
Which leads to Border Pillar
Number 635 and 638.

1313
02:17:10,493 --> 02:17:13,485
I will see the paths
as well as the Border Pillar.

1314
02:17:13,530 --> 02:17:18,467
Sure, Sir. We can see the
border post of Pakistan also.

1315
02:17:43,460 --> 02:17:44,950
Give me two Dukes' Mangola.

1316
02:17:46,563 --> 02:17:48,190
Then give me two bottles of Pepsi.

1317
02:19:17,787 --> 02:19:19,550
Seal all the exits.

1318
02:19:50,954 --> 02:19:53,445
Hey, the door is not opening!

1319
02:19:54,057 --> 02:19:55,854
Open the door!

1320
02:19:58,795 --> 02:20:03,129
Your attention, everybody! Do not
create a racket and listen to me!

1321
02:20:03,700 --> 02:20:06,601
Please remain where you are.

1322
02:20:07,170 --> 02:20:09,764
The police have surrounded
the entire cinema hall.

1323
02:20:10,440 --> 02:20:14,934
Do not fear. We are looking out
for a man who is here right now.

1324
02:20:16,379 --> 02:20:18,472
All the exits of the hall are sealed.

1325
02:20:19,315 --> 02:20:21,283
Only the door behind will open.

1326
02:20:21,484 --> 02:20:24,920
So, please come to
that door, one by one.

1327
02:20:25,488 --> 02:20:29,584
We want no problems created,
so please cooperate with the police.

1328
02:20:29,626 --> 02:20:31,651
And come out from that door.

1329
02:20:34,631 --> 02:20:36,462
Have two men posted near that door.

1330
02:20:37,333 --> 02:20:38,698
Is everything ready?

1331
02:20:40,036 --> 02:20:42,300
Fine. Open the door.

1332
02:21:59,916 --> 02:22:03,875
Stop! I say, stop!
Please don't go!

1333
02:22:50,133 --> 02:22:53,102
Were you aware that the
whole theater was packed?

1334
02:22:57,707 --> 02:23:02,110
Yet, you had all the exits
locked from outside?

1335
02:23:03,346 --> 02:23:09,046
My intention was to nab Satya and
I didn't want him to flee from there.

1336
02:23:09,886 --> 02:23:15,722
You deemed it right to put
1,000 lives in danger for that?

1337
02:23:19,362 --> 02:23:24,698
I had no inkling...
about whatever happened.

1338
02:23:24,734 --> 02:23:29,364
You just mentioned that you did this
so that Satya would not escape...

1339
02:23:29,572 --> 02:23:32,063
...since he certainly
would make an attempt. Right?

1340
02:23:34,444 --> 02:23:37,106
So why didn't you have an inkling,
that in order to escape...

1341
02:23:37,146 --> 02:23:41,276
...he could take a more
dangerous step? Which he did!

1342
02:23:42,752 --> 02:23:48,122
- 5 children, 6 women and 10 men
were killed in that stampede.

1343
02:23:49,058 --> 02:23:51,322
Who is responsible for that?

1344
02:23:54,697 --> 02:23:59,896
I did only what I deemed correct
at that moment, that situation.

1345
02:24:04,274 --> 02:24:07,368
Deceived Khandelkar,
eliminated Amod Shukla!

1346
02:24:07,477 --> 02:24:10,071
Guru Narayan, even you are gone!

1347
02:24:10,313 --> 02:24:13,146
Who made Bhau win
the election? Bhiku Mhatre!

1348
02:24:15,818 --> 02:24:19,310
Who is the King of Mumbai?
Bhiku Mhatre!

1349
02:24:22,091 --> 02:24:27,996
Is there anybody in Mumbai
to challenge Bhiku?

1350
02:24:28,698 --> 02:24:30,359
There's absolutely nobody!

1351
02:24:30,867 --> 02:24:33,358
What a fantastic racket
you created at the theater!

1352
02:24:33,736 --> 02:24:35,966
- It could have backfired too.
- Meaning?

1353
02:24:36,639 --> 02:24:41,702
People were trampling each other
in the stampede that took place.

1354
02:24:41,778 --> 02:24:43,973
I wonder how many people perished.

1355
02:24:44,847 --> 02:24:47,338
Hey, were you afraid?

1356
02:24:47,917 --> 02:24:51,045
Not for myself, Bhiku,
but for Vidya.

1357
02:24:51,754 --> 02:24:53,688
She could have been one of them.

1358
02:24:53,723 --> 02:24:55,884
Why are you making
an issue of it, huh?

1359
02:24:56,292 --> 02:25:00,023
Both of us are alive, and so
is Vidya. Why do you worry then?

1360
02:25:00,296 --> 02:25:02,821
What's the guarantee that
we will be alive tomorrow?

1361
02:25:02,865 --> 02:25:04,833
This profession is such.

1362
02:25:06,502 --> 02:25:09,733
I can't take it any longer.
I will tell Vidya everything.

1363
02:25:10,106 --> 02:25:11,073
What?

1364
02:25:11,107 --> 02:25:15,669
Everything about myself,
who I am, what I do.

1365
02:25:16,879 --> 02:25:21,373
Hey, you fool! Are you crazy?
What will you tell her?

1366
02:25:21,784 --> 02:25:23,251
That you are a criminal, a gangster?

1367
02:25:23,653 --> 02:25:25,644
That the police are looking out
for you for several murder cases?

1368
02:25:25,888 --> 02:25:28,948
Do you think she will forgive
you after hearing everything?!

1369
02:25:28,991 --> 02:25:31,960
And say that she still loves you
because you told her the truth?!

1370
02:25:31,994 --> 02:25:34,394
- So should I lie to her forever?!
- Why do you have to say the truth?!

1371
02:25:34,430 --> 02:25:36,261
I want to marry her!

1372
02:25:42,939 --> 02:25:44,998
I am tired of lying to her.

1373
02:25:45,808 --> 02:25:49,835
Whenever I'm with her, I am
scared about what she will ask me.

1374
02:25:50,847 --> 02:25:54,840
I am not the Satya she loves.
How long will this go on?

1375
02:25:56,252 --> 02:25:59,915
After the incident at the theater,
I fear about the future.

1376
02:26:03,993 --> 02:26:08,623
Bhiku, do you know which were
the best days of my life?

1377
02:26:09,799 --> 02:26:12,632
The four days which
I had spent with Vidya.

1378
02:26:13,102 --> 02:26:15,662
Remember, when I had returned,
you were scared for me?

1379
02:26:16,172 --> 02:26:18,697
I don't want to live that way
for the rest of my life!

1380
02:26:19,342 --> 02:26:23,244
Bhiku, I am afraid
of losing Vidya.

1381
02:26:23,746 --> 02:26:26,909
And all the joys which
I receive from her.

1382
02:26:27,750 --> 02:26:30,947
But what can I do? Nothing.

1383
02:26:32,422 --> 02:26:37,155
I'm not the same Satya for whom
these things made no difference.

1384
02:26:37,627 --> 02:26:41,290
But now, the death of the innocents
makes a difference to me.

1385
02:26:44,300 --> 02:26:47,064
Each one of them must have had
somebody who

1386
02:26:48,037 --> 02:26:50,301
Just the way I love Vidya.

1387
02:26:50,973 --> 02:26:55,307
Bhiku, Vidya's life can be in
danger if I don't say the truth.

1388
02:26:55,912 --> 02:26:58,005
I will have to tell her the truth!

1389
02:26:58,080 --> 02:27:04,508
I will tell her everything!

1390
02:27:25,141 --> 02:27:28,440
Satya, don't tell her the truth.

1391
02:27:28,544 --> 02:27:29,442
Listen to me.

1392
02:27:31,814 --> 02:27:35,272
Of what use is a truth
that will ruin her life?!

1393
02:27:42,258 --> 02:27:46,422
Tell her a lie... a last lie.

1394
02:27:48,197 --> 02:27:51,098
Tell her that you have
got a job in Dubai.

1395
02:27:51,601 --> 02:27:54,001
I will make all
the arrangements there.

1396
02:27:54,337 --> 02:27:59,798
Your business will
be absolutely legal, understand?

1397
02:28:02,712 --> 02:28:07,581
I will handle everything here.
Take her and be happy.

1398
02:28:13,256 --> 02:28:16,225
At least, nod in agreement!

1399
02:28:16,926 --> 02:28:18,120
Nod.

1400
02:28:22,164 --> 02:28:24,325
- Shall I tell you something?
- What?

1401
02:28:27,336 --> 02:28:29,531
I am jealous of Vidya.

1402
02:28:31,207 --> 02:28:33,971
Stop it, please don't joke.

1403
02:28:35,011 --> 02:28:37,138
Yes, I am very jealous of Vidya.

1404
02:28:37,780 --> 02:28:39,941
Tell me something...
will you invite me for your wedding?

1405
02:28:40,883 --> 02:28:42,214
- No.
- To Dubai?

1406
02:28:42,785 --> 02:28:46,516
I'll make all the arrangements
there. I'll bring money.

1407
02:28:47,223 --> 02:28:50,021
And Bhiku Mhatre will dance there!

1408
02:28:52,194 --> 02:28:54,025
Please don't joke.

1409
02:28:54,063 --> 02:28:58,397
The whole of Dubai knows
Bhiku Mhatre, understand?

1410
02:29:00,870 --> 02:29:04,863
Let's go. Even the sun has set,
listening to your talks!

1411
02:29:07,743 --> 02:29:09,643
How are you?

1412
02:29:10,012 --> 02:29:13,971
Keep this away... keep this away!

1413
02:29:15,284 --> 02:29:21,553
Scoundrel! What did I tell you?

1414
02:29:22,291 --> 02:29:23,952
How are you?

1415
02:29:26,996 --> 02:29:28,293
- What's her name?
- Sony.

1416
02:29:28,331 --> 02:29:30,162
- That's my daughter's name.
- Really?

1417
02:29:30,600 --> 02:29:32,761
Hello, Bhikubhai!

1418
02:29:32,802 --> 02:29:37,830
Bhikubhai, sit with
us also sometimes.

1419
02:29:37,873 --> 02:29:40,239
Yes... I will.

1420
02:29:41,243 --> 02:29:42,574
Bhau has won the election!

1421
02:29:42,612 --> 02:29:44,239
You'll drink the
whole bottle to celebrate!

1422
02:29:44,280 --> 02:29:46,771
Your wife will leave you then,
and I'll have to bring her back!

1423
02:29:47,416 --> 02:29:48,815
- How are you?
- Fine.

1424
02:29:49,352 --> 02:29:50,876
Keep that away, I'm scared.

1425
02:29:53,689 --> 02:29:58,023
Bhau won!

1426
02:29:58,728 --> 02:30:02,186
Look, I have won the election!

1427
02:30:04,033 --> 02:30:08,561
My Bhau has won!

1428
02:30:09,639 --> 02:30:13,131
My little child!...
Look at this garland!

1429
02:30:13,943 --> 02:30:16,036
I've won!

1430
02:30:21,917 --> 02:30:25,853
Now, sit. I'll make you a drink...
And where is Satya?

1431
02:30:25,888 --> 02:30:27,150
- He hasn't come.
- No?

1432
02:30:27,890 --> 02:30:30,484
How will Satya come?
He must be with his girl!

1433
02:30:30,526 --> 02:30:32,653
He's jealous because
he couldn't find anyone!

1434
02:30:33,162 --> 02:30:35,426
He is bald, so he
didn't find a girl!

1435
02:30:35,464 --> 02:30:38,627
My bald uncle, find a bald aunt!

1436
02:30:39,201 --> 02:30:42,193
Sit here, I'll make you a drink.

1437
02:30:42,238 --> 02:30:43,569
I'll make.

1438
02:30:43,606 --> 02:30:46,973
I've won the election
today, right? So, you sit.

1439
02:30:47,009 --> 02:30:49,705
Hey, Bhiku, come here.

1440
02:30:50,613 --> 02:30:54,276
- Bhau is preparing a drink.
- He is stone drunk!

1441
02:30:55,618 --> 02:30:57,711
Bhau, I'll tell you
something today.

1442
02:30:58,020 --> 02:31:01,581
I'll give you some
happy news today...

1443
02:31:29,485 --> 02:31:32,943
Even my mother never opposed me,
right since the time I was so small.

1444
02:31:33,389 --> 02:31:35,084
And this swine!

1445
02:31:35,825 --> 02:31:39,989
I was waiting for the election
or I'd have eliminated him long back.

1446
02:31:57,346 --> 02:31:59,814
There was no other way out.

1447
02:32:03,052 --> 02:32:04,986
The matter is not very simple.

1448
02:32:05,521 --> 02:32:09,321
If Bhau entered politics,
Bhiku would operate the gang.

1449
02:32:11,160 --> 02:32:15,961
As long as there's Satya,
Bhau would be troubled by Bhiku.

1450
02:32:19,135 --> 02:32:21,933
Who the hell is Satya!

1451
02:32:24,573 --> 02:32:26,837
He set off to challenge Bhau!

1452
02:32:26,876 --> 02:32:29,208
Bhau is no ordinary man,
he can do anything.

1453
02:32:29,378 --> 02:32:32,472
He could become the
Chief Minister someday.

1454
02:32:33,315 --> 02:32:34,714
My choice was clear.

1455
02:32:35,584 --> 02:32:40,317
With great difficulty,
I convinced Bhau not to kill you.

1456
02:32:42,525 --> 02:32:44,618
I know that you will understand.

1457
02:32:48,430 --> 02:32:52,833
This bloody scoundrel
will never understand!

1458
02:32:52,868 --> 02:32:57,237
He was obsessed with Satya!

1459
02:32:58,541 --> 02:33:00,202
And he died!

1460
02:33:00,576 --> 02:33:03,807
At Satya's behest, he killed
Guru and Amod Shukla!

1461
02:33:04,346 --> 02:33:06,678
And now, even he is dead!

1462
02:33:07,983 --> 02:33:09,712
Bloody fool!

1463
02:33:09,752 --> 02:33:12,243
He didn't understand our profession.

1464
02:33:12,288 --> 02:33:17,521
I had told him that if one dies,
then everybody else will follow suit.

1465
02:33:18,394 --> 02:33:19,793
Satya too will be finished.

1466
02:33:20,896 --> 02:33:23,023
Khandelkar has been tipped off.

1467
02:33:23,766 --> 02:33:27,133
The police will arrest Satya
for Amod Shukla's murder.

1468
02:33:29,238 --> 02:33:31,206
Understand?

1469
02:33:35,978 --> 02:33:37,741
- Mother is sleeping.
- I want to tell you something.

1470
02:33:37,780 --> 02:33:39,179
- What's it?
- Come on.

1471
02:33:39,682 --> 02:33:41,274
Hey, Satya! What's the matter?

1472
02:33:45,554 --> 02:33:47,715
Satya, what is the matter?

1473
02:33:48,257 --> 02:33:52,023
I've got a job in Dubai
and a salary of Rs.25,000.

1474
02:33:53,896 --> 02:33:57,093
Rs.25,000! Really?!

1475
02:33:57,700 --> 02:34:01,568
Yes. We'll get married
and go there with mother.

1476
02:34:03,272 --> 02:34:06,173
Mother is calling me. I'll tell
her about it and come back soon!

1477
02:34:07,943 --> 02:34:11,242
Mother, do you know what's happened
today? You can't even imagine!

1478
02:34:11,480 --> 02:34:14,881
Satya has got a job,
and that too, in Dubai!

1479
02:34:31,000 --> 02:34:33,833
Where is Satya?
Where is he?!

1480
02:34:34,937 --> 02:34:36,928
I live in the house opposite.

1481
02:34:36,972 --> 02:34:42,137
You do? So, do you stay glued
to anybody whom you meet opposite?!

1482
02:34:43,879 --> 02:34:47,975
You are wearing a very nice sari.
Does he bring them for you?

1483
02:34:50,552 --> 02:34:53,783
You don't have a father.
How are the expenses borne?

1484
02:34:54,623 --> 02:34:56,955
Does he look after
you and your mother?

1485
02:34:57,893 --> 02:35:00,225
I... I work.

1486
02:35:00,729 --> 02:35:03,391
I know. You sing, don't you?

1487
02:35:04,433 --> 02:35:07,596
Satya threatened that music director
to have your album recorded, right?

1488
02:35:08,637 --> 02:35:11,936
Do you think he recorded
your album, hearing you sing?!

1489
02:35:12,741 --> 02:35:14,834
The swine threatened him
at gunpoint!

1490
02:35:15,277 --> 02:35:19,839
What were both of you talking
about before the police came?

1491
02:35:20,349 --> 02:35:22,249
What were you talking about?!

1492
02:35:25,788 --> 02:35:27,346
- In Dubai...
- Dubai?

1493
02:35:27,856 --> 02:35:29,221
A job.

1494
02:35:30,259 --> 02:35:31,556
What about Dubai?

1495
02:35:32,328 --> 02:35:34,455
The hotel at which
he is working...

1496
02:35:34,964 --> 02:35:39,367
He works at a hotel?
That swine is a bloody pimp!

1497
02:35:40,369 --> 02:35:43,668
He was in jail for that
before he joined the gang!

1498
02:35:44,306 --> 02:35:47,935
Do you know the gangster Bhiku
Mhatre? Satya is his right hand man!

1499
02:35:49,278 --> 02:35:50,404
Swine!

1500
02:35:58,587 --> 02:36:02,523
Do you know them? That bloody
scoundrel killed all of them!

1501
02:36:03,692 --> 02:36:05,660
The police are searching him
for 17 murder cases!

1502
02:36:05,694 --> 02:36:07,355
And you are involved with him?!

1503
02:36:07,496 --> 02:36:10,693
Will he marry you! He'll take you
to Dubai and sell you to a Sheikh!

1504
02:36:11,600 --> 02:36:12,897
Bloody pimp!

1505
02:36:16,505 --> 02:36:17,836
The boss has summoned you, Sir.

1506
02:36:51,840 --> 02:36:53,501
Kill him.

1507
02:37:04,453 --> 02:37:10,449
Bhau will find out
that we have killed him.

1508
02:37:12,094 --> 02:37:14,722
There's a ship leaving
for Dubai in the evening.

1509
02:37:15,397 --> 02:37:19,231
I have made arrangements for you.
Go away from here.

1510
02:37:20,602 --> 02:37:22,160
What's left now?

1511
02:37:28,877 --> 02:37:30,344
Where's Bhau?

1512
02:37:34,817 --> 02:37:36,842
What will you do to him?

1513
02:37:41,056 --> 02:37:43,286
What will you do to Bhau?

1514
02:37:43,826 --> 02:37:46,989
Do you want Bhau?
What will you do to him?

1515
02:37:47,830 --> 02:37:50,765
Answer me! What will you do to him?

1516
02:37:53,502 --> 02:37:55,367
Uncle...

1517
02:37:55,771 --> 02:37:57,705
Give me just one chance.

1518
02:37:58,907 --> 02:37:59,771
If.

1519
02:38:06,014 --> 02:38:11,008
Give me just one chance.

1520
02:39:59,194 --> 02:40:00,957
Hail Lord Ganesha!

1521
02:40:01,396 --> 02:40:03,591
Come soon the next year!

1522
02:40:03,932 --> 02:40:05,900
Hail Lord Ganesha!

1523
02:40:18,513 --> 02:40:23,712
Hail Lord Ganesha!

1524
02:42:48,298 --> 02:42:49,822
Are you all right, Satya?

1525
02:42:52,336 --> 02:42:56,204
The police will be present at every
corner in 30 minutes but don't worry.

1526
02:42:56,773 --> 02:43:01,710
A ship will leave for Dubai
in half an hour.

1527
02:43:02,379 --> 02:43:06,145
We'll reach the dock within
an hour. Don't worry, okay?

1528
02:43:07,217 --> 02:43:09,048
- Listen to me, uncle.
- Yes?

1529
02:43:09,086 --> 02:43:11,077
Please take me to Vidya once.

1530
02:43:12,022 --> 02:43:14,786
- Take me to Vidya just once.
- Are you nuts?!

1531
02:43:15,292 --> 02:43:17,021
Take you to Vidya!!
You've gone crazy!

1532
02:43:17,361 --> 02:43:21,297
We have to reach the dock in 30
minutes and get out of the city, okay?

1533
02:43:21,999 --> 02:43:24,433
- We have to leave!
- Take me to Vidya just once.

1534
02:43:25,168 --> 02:43:27,068
Get lost! Don't be foolish, Satya!

1535
02:43:28,505 --> 02:43:32,635
You know that if we miss this ship,
we'll be killed. We've got to go!

1536
02:43:33,110 --> 02:43:35,601
We have to leave!

1537
02:43:35,746 --> 02:43:37,145
Uncle.

1538
02:43:37,180 --> 02:43:40,513
- Don't be mad! I won't take you!
- Take me to Vidya.

1539
02:43:41,084 --> 02:43:42,676
Take me to Vidya.

1540
02:43:48,759 --> 02:43:53,093
All right, I'll take you.
Take away the gun.

1541
02:44:05,242 --> 02:44:07,870
Listen, come back soon!

1542
02:45:15,912 --> 02:45:19,109
I live in the house opposite.

1543
02:45:48,145 --> 02:45:50,807
Vidya, open the door.

1544
02:45:52,215 --> 02:45:57,380
Please open the door just once.

1545
02:45:59,156 --> 02:46:00,123
Go away!

1546
02:46:01,424 --> 02:46:04,985
Please open the door just once.

1547
02:46:06,763 --> 02:46:08,890
I say, go away!

1548
02:46:09,633 --> 02:46:11,624
Vidya, please open the door!

1549
02:46:12,502 --> 02:46:14,299
Go away!!

1550
02:46:19,276 --> 02:46:23,269
I lied because I didn't
want to lose you.

1551
02:46:25,949 --> 02:46:27,439
Go away!

1552
02:46:28,151 --> 02:46:30,210
No! ...No!!

1553
02:46:30,987 --> 02:46:36,857
I will go away for good
and never return.

1554
02:46:39,362 --> 02:46:41,853
I only wish to see you once.

1555
02:46:51,107 --> 02:46:52,540
Don't move!

1556
02:47:01,718 --> 02:47:03,242
Keep an eye on him

1557
02:47:26,009 --> 02:47:28,204
Vidya, I'll break open the door!

1558
02:47:29,279 --> 02:47:31,941
Open the door!

1559
02:47:33,216 --> 02:47:36,083
- What's happening?
- Send her away!

1560
02:47:38,588 --> 02:47:41,250
Open the door!

1561
02:47:42,192 --> 02:47:43,921
Open the door!

1562
02:49:04,941 --> 02:49:05,930
Move back

1563
02:49:15,085 --> 02:49:16,575
Move back!
