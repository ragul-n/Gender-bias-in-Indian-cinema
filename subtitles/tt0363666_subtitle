"Put up your veil."

00:12:54,473 --> 00:12:58,753
Omelet sir.. - You swine,
is this an omelet.

68
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:00,779
Pick it up from here.

69
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,248
You, fool get lost.

70
00:13:02,248 --> 00:13:04,798
I'll take it away sir, but
why are you swearing at me.

71
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:07,301
You two-bit fool.
Son of a beggar.

72
00:13:07,686 --> 00:13:09,706
I'm not a two-bit man
sir I'm a one-bit man.

73
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:12,089
But why are you swearing at me.
- You, you are answering me.

74
00:13:16,362 --> 00:13:18,672
Hey stop your hand.

75
00:13:20,065 --> 00:13:23,225
Hey who are you..
- That's nice.

76
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:25,303
You have great style"
such great style.

77
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:27,354
You're hit that poor man. If
you have the guts hit me.

78
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:30,370
We'll hit you <i>so</i> bad the
hospital won't take you in.

79
00:13:30,843 --> 00:13:33,303
I will admit myself to the
hospital. You hit me..

80
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,269
You hit me. You won't
hit me like that.

81
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,817
You won't"

82
00:14:26,665 --> 00:14:32,435
Get up.. - Sagan.
- Let me go..

83
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:35,439
He was beating a poor man.

84
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:37,441
The poor man is already
hit by poverty.

85
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:38,776
And now this goon
will also hit him.

86
00:14:38,777 --> 00:14:40,511
If you want to beat
up someone, beat me.

87
00:14:40,512 --> 00:14:42,447
It's my hobby to get beaten up.

88
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:44,698
My fate is also tired
of harassing me.

89
00:14:45,117 --> 00:14:47,051
How will these useless
people hit me?

90
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:49,422
Saar! - Fool, you were beating up
a poor man. - Let it be..

91
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:51,556
Your coat sir.
- Take your coat, c' Mon.

92
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:53,727
Come with me.
- He..

93
00:14:54,126 --> 00:14:55,327
Come out with me.

94
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:57,327
Saar.. - He was beating
up the poor man.

95
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:00,063
- Saar.. Saar..

96
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:04,406
He was beating up the
poor man. Hit me..

97
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:08,640
Stop! - He was beating up the poor..
- You'll die like this.

98
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:11,241
Oh be quiet. I'll die..

99
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:13,763
My death is also betraying
me like my fate did.

100
00:15:14,313 --> 00:15:16,313
It won't come <i>so</i> easily.

101
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:19,296
My whole life I have
been drinking..

102
00:15:19,718 --> 00:15:22,298
With the hope that this liquor
will kill me one day.

103
00:15:23,055 --> 00:15:25,075
The whole day I fight
with people..

104
00:15:25,457 --> 00:15:27,457
In this hope that one
of them will kill me.

105
00:15:27,826 --> 00:15:30,926
Will knife my heart and
tear my heart to pieces.

106
00:15:31,463 --> 00:15:34,213
But no.. - Sagan. - No
one does it my friend.

107
00:15:36,368 --> 00:15:39,848
Opal, I don't want to live.

108
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:47,172
Saar, don't talk rubbish.
- This is not useless.

109
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:50,424
This is the biggest
truth of my life.

110
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:55,321
I want to be killed.
- What happened?

111
00:15:55,854 --> 00:15:57,388
What is it? What.

112
00:15:57,389 --> 00:15:59,389
Why are you <i>so</i> emotional today?

113
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,458
Yes, I am a little
emotional today.

114
00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:05,491
Because on this day all
my emotions were dead.

115
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:12,468
Goa, did you forget.. What
is the date today.. - What?

116
00:16:13,672 --> 00:16:19,212
18th November. This day is
like a 1000 deaths to me.

117
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:22,956
Come on.. stop it.

118
00:16:23,415 --> 00:16:28,075
No.. let it be I'm alone.
I'll go home alone too.

119
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:33,361
But I'll drop you home.
- No.. I'm a lone man.

120
00:16:34,093 --> 00:16:36,643
But..
- No.. I'll go home alone.

121
00:16:40,032 --> 00:16:43,512
I am a lone man. I'll
go home alone too.

122
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:07,150
Hey brother" I think like me
your food was spoiled too.

123
00:17:37,189 --> 00:17:39,649
Hey does this kid know someone.

124
00:17:40,426 --> 00:17:42,446
Does he have a relative?

125
00:17:44,096 --> 00:17:47,996
Is there anyone who loves him?

126
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:53,413
Look, it's my last
Warning to you.

127
00:17:54,106 --> 00:17:58,586
I'll count to three. If no
one <i>comes</i> till that count.

128
00:17:59,311 --> 00:18:01,311
Then this kid will be mine.

129
00:18:02,981 --> 00:18:10,101
1..2..3..

130
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:16,460
Tell me who's
is he? I won the case.

131
00:18:58,036 --> 00:19:03,306
So tell me who are you?
Anyway whoever you are"

132
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,143
...you are my guest tonight.

133
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:10,971
Because it's 18th
November tonight.

134
00:19:14,052 --> 00:19:16,952
Hey I don't even know your name.

135
00:19:18,123 --> 00:19:20,123
Then what should I call you?

136
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:26,761
I'll do one thing. I'll name
you.

137
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:34,813
Like your beautiful face.

138
00:19:39,077 --> 00:19:41,077
Raja"

139
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:48,177
Raja" Raja"

140
00:19:49,087 --> 00:19:51,897
I think someone murdered him.
- It could be suicide too.

141
00:19:52,391 --> 00:19:53,625
No.. no someone has killed him.

142
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:55,625
Yes it doesn't look
like a suicide.

143
00:19:55,827 --> 00:19:58,227
It looks like a murder.
- Yes, I think <i>so</i> too.

144
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,208
Hey move.. move..
the police is here.

145
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:30,445
Does anyone know this man here?
- No, we don't.

146
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:05,028
Hey.. Maharaja

147
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:07,347
Maharaja, don't play
with this blade.

148
00:21:08,066 --> 00:21:10,906
There are years before
you have a beard.

149
00:21:11,403 --> 00:21:14,563
And these small hands
will get cut.

150
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:26,746
Oh yes, I forgot to ask
you the real question.

151
00:21:28,053 --> 00:21:30,663
You know drink a lot. And
yesterday I drank <i>so</i> much"

152
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:33,123
"that a person could
have had a bath.

153
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:38,250
I couldn't help my self when
I saw you on the footpath.

154
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:40,797
So I brought you here.

155
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:43,413
Now tell me what is
your parent's name.

156
00:21:43,835 --> 00:21:46,055
Where do they stay?
What do they do?

157
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:53,893
They must be looking for you.

158
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:05,560
Common Mr. Raja" Hey

159
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:09,209
C' Mon let's go to
the doctor first.

160
00:22:10,028 --> 00:22:12,028
And we'll search in
the papers later.

00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:56,541
You are showing me this"

162
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:58,541
It is called a show.

163
00:23:17,095 --> 00:23:19,645
He went away.. who was he..

164
00:23:36,381 --> 00:23:38,282
Excuse me..
- Yes please.

165
00:23:38,283 --> 00:23:40,453
Is the Managing Director
inside? - Yes he is.

166
00:23:41,052 --> 00:23:43,052
Thank you.
- It's all right.

167
00:23:45,056 --> 00:23:47,246
Write to them that they will
receive their goods next week.

168
00:23:54,399 --> 00:23:57,029

Hello.. Inspector.

How are you?

No, it's OK. Never mind.
Please sit down.

173
00:24:11,216 --> 00:24:14,116
Today in the morning near the
shore I found a dead body.

174
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:19,910
After investigating I found out
that it's your manager Moran.

Are you sure?
- Yes we are sure.

177
00:24:28,099 --> 00:24:31,029
Someone killed him and threw
his body in the sea.

178
00:24:31,536 --> 00:24:33,103
According to the post
postmortem report..

179
00:24:33,104 --> 00:24:35,414
...he was killed <i>3</i> days ago.

180
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:38,041
Right now his body
is in the morgue.

181
00:24:38,243 --> 00:24:41,053
And if he has a heir,
or relative tell us.

182
00:24:41,546 --> 00:24:42,680
So that his body can be
handed over to them.

183
00:24:42,681 --> 00:24:46,251
There is no one here. Oh yes he
has a mother in the village.

184
00:24:47,219 --> 00:24:50,879
She stays very sick. I think
it's not right to tell her that.

185
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:53,590
You do one thing give
the dead body to us.

186
00:24:53,859 --> 00:24:55,659
We'll perform the
last rites for him.

187
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,194
So you bring the body here.

188
00:24:57,195 --> 00:25:02,675
Oh yes I'd like to know
something more. - Yes tell me.

189
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:07,482
Did Moran, have enmity
with anyone?

190
00:25:08,073 --> 00:25:11,853
Sir, Moran can't have
enmity to anyone.

191
00:25:12,544 --> 00:25:18,754
He was a very innocent,
straight and sincere man.

192
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:26,726
After my father's death when
everything fell on me.

193
00:25:27,592 --> 00:25:29,592
I would take “Johan's advice
in everything I did.

194
00:25:31,096 --> 00:25:36,726
Now after his death, I feel
like I have lost another hand.

195
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:41,287
He was not just a manager to me.

196
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:45,486
He was like a.. like
a brother too.

197
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:54,287
He's gone. All good, and
straight, innocent"

198
00:25:55,120 --> 00:26:00,010
...people died one by one.

199
00:26:02,193 --> 00:26:07,293
Inspector! Are you sure
that he is our Moran.

200
00:26:08,099 --> 00:26:11,499
Yes" I am sure.
- Oh my God.

201
00:26:14,105 --> 00:26:17,235
I shall personally claim
the body. - Fine.

202
00:26:18,043 --> 00:26:22,733
I'll leave now. But when ever
I need your help in this case.

203
00:26:23,481 --> 00:26:26,261
I will come to bother you.
- It's not a bother Inspector.

204
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:29,181
This is my duty.
- Thank you.

205
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:41,030
Hello Jillian.

206
00:26:42,367 --> 00:26:44,677
Yes. - Announce in the office
that someone killed..

207
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:48,293
...Sheri Moran Kumar
three days ago.

208
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,860
And the office will remain
closed to mourn him.

209
00:26:51,242 --> 00:26:53,110
And I am going to
claim the body. Go!

210
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:57,801
Sir, I saw that kid in this
city with some man.

211
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:02,180
He recognised me. It's
Possible if he sees..

212
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:04,867
...you he may recognise you too.

213
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:12,877
"I loved you before.."

214
00:27:13,498 --> 00:27:18,388
"Now I'm in love with love."

215
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:23,390
"You aren't the only
one in my arms."

216
00:27:24,075 --> 00:27:30,315
"Now I have the world in it."

217
00:28:02,647 --> 00:28:05,017
"Hey I am everyone's "

218
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:07,418
"But I have no one."

219
00:28:07,419 --> 00:28:10,729
"No one shed a tear for me."

220
00:28:15,126 --> 00:28:18,556
"Hey I am everyone's "
"But I have no one."

221
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:22,500
"No one shed a tear for me."

222
00:28:23,068 --> 00:28:26,498
"No one shed a tear for me."

223
00:28:34,312 --> 00:28:38,182
"if I could make the Ta.."

224
00:28:38,817 --> 00:28:42,247
"No one would have
broken my heart."

225
00:28:46,691 --> 00:28:50,151
"My own Tammuz.."

226
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:54,239
"Wouldn't have left me alone."

227
00:28:54,833 --> 00:28:57,963
"Wouldn't have left me alone."

228
00:28:58,503 --> 00:29:00,503
"Hey I am everyone's "

229
00:29:00,638 --> 00:29:02,606
"But I have no one."

230
00:29:02,607 --> 00:29:05,917
"No one shed a tear for me."

231
00:29:06,478 --> 00:29:08,478
"Hey I am everyone's "

232
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,447
"But I have no one."

233
00:29:10,448 --> 00:29:13,698
"No one shed a tear for me."

234
00:29:37,175 --> 00:29:41,075
"These rich shots with palaces."

235
00:29:41,713 --> 00:29:45,023
"Are very stingy at heart."

236
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:52,914
"Many shiny coins here."

237
00:29:53,491 --> 00:29:55,491
"When checked.."

238
00:29:55,827 --> 00:29:57,328
"They turned out to be false."

239
00:29:57,328 --> 00:29:59,096
"When checked.."

240
00:29:59,097 --> 00:30:01,097
"They turned out to be false."

241
00:30:01,232 --> 00:30:03,232
"Hey I am everyone's "

242
00:30:03,401 --> 00:30:05,302
"But I have no one."

243
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:08,583
"No one shed a tear for me."

244
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:11,140
"Hey I am everyone's "

245
00:30:11,376 --> 00:30:13,277
"But I have no one."

246
00:30:13,278 --> 00:30:16,558
"No one shed a tear for me."

247
00:31:16,107 --> 00:31:19,537
"With his people..

248
00:31:20,111 --> 00:31:23,771
"What justice has God done."

249
00:31:28,253 --> 00:31:31,793
"Those who had to be loved."

250
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:35,670
"Have been left to live alone."

251
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:39,657
"Have been left to live alone."

252
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:42,231
"Hey I am everyone's "

253
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:44,134
"But I have no one."

254
00:31:44,135 --> 00:31:47,595
"No one shed a tear for me."

255
00:31:48,172 --> 00:31:51,572
"No one shed a tear for me."

00:31:52,143 --> 00:31:54,143
"Hey I am everyone's "

257
00:31:54,145 --> 00:31:55,879
"But I have no one."

258
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:59,220
"No one shed a tear for me."

259
00:31:59,784 --> 00:32:03,244
"No one shed a tear for me."

260
00:33:02,046 --> 00:33:04,046
Raja"

261
00:33:07,085 --> 00:33:09,085
Raja"

262
00:33:27,205 --> 00:33:29,205
Raja"

263
00:33:34,145 --> 00:33:36,145
Raja!

264
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:49,408
There was <i>so</i> much noise.
Didn't you hear it..

265
00:33:58,136 --> 00:34:04,346
God, you are deaf.
Are you dumb too.

266
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:14,269
Don't worry I'll take
you to the doctor.

267
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:34,180
Did you take him to some
other doctor before this?

268
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:37,592
No.. I mean I don't know.
- I don't know.

269
00:34:38,109 --> 00:34:40,109
What kind of an irresponsible
father are you?

270
00:34:40,111 --> 00:34:44,501
No I'm not his father. I found
him on the footpath.

271
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:48,360
So I took him with me.
- Oh..

272
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,054
So meet his parents.

273
00:34:51,055 --> 00:34:55,595
I was thinking of putting
in an ad in the papers.

274
00:34:56,561 --> 00:35:00,431
Maybe his parents could come to
take him after seeing that.

275
00:35:02,133 --> 00:35:06,383
It's of no use Mr. Saar. I
can't say surely but I suspect his..

276
00:35:07,071 --> 00:35:11,381
"Parents left him on the
footpath to get rid of him.

277
00:35:13,044 --> 00:35:15,624
Because the check shows
that this kid..

278
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:18,080
"Is dumb and deaf since birth.

279
00:35:24,088 --> 00:35:28,478
If that is the case then I will
never get rid of him doctor.

280
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,440
And I will take care
of him all his life.

281
00:35:33,097 --> 00:35:35,787
But doctor, is there
any way or a cure.

282
00:35:36,267 --> 00:35:40,017
So that he will be able to live
in this city after some years.

283
00:35:41,372 --> 00:35:44,272
There is one dumb and deaf
institution in Bombay.

284
00:35:45,176 --> 00:35:47,666
If you get him admitted
there he will speak"

285
00:35:48,112 --> 00:35:50,112
"some broken words
in a few years.

286
00:35:50,381 --> 00:35:52,381
They give very good
training there.

287
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:56,860
He may not be able to hear us
but will know sign language.

288
00:35:58,122 --> 00:36:00,732
They teach the kids to lip read.

289
00:36:01,192 --> 00:36:02,793
It's called the lip movement.

290
00:36:02,793 --> 00:36:04,793
Then when he looks
at your lips"

291
00:36:05,062 --> 00:36:07,672
...he'll know what your saying.

292
00:36:08,132 --> 00:36:12,932
They teach them to talk with
AA.. i.. u.. eye such sounds.

293
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:58,100
Hey.. ya..ya..

294
00:36:58,482 --> 00:37:02,082
Ya.. ya.. ya" Ya"

295
00:37:02,987 --> 00:37:04,987
Ya.. ya.. ya" Ya"

296
00:37:07,992 --> 00:37:10,832
Someone's child died.
Why are you scared?

297
00:37:11,329 --> 00:37:13,639
Hey where did you get this toy?

298
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:16,065
Come" I'll buy you
some new toys.

299
00:37:16,334 --> 00:37:18,644
It's not good to take such toys.

300
00:37:47,665 --> 00:37:49,715
Come in sir..
- Please give me an elephant"

301
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:52,291
...dog, horse everything.
- OK.

302
00:37:54,038 --> 00:37:56,038
Here take this"
- Thank you.

303
00:38:06,984 --> 00:38:08,984
Raja"

304
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:13,789
Raja"

305
00:38:18,996 --> 00:38:21,926
Raja" Raja"

306
00:38:50,027 --> 00:38:52,247
Is she Raids mother?

307
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:55,030
Raja"

308
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:02,937
He.. - Why are you looking
at me like that?

309
00:39:03,541 --> 00:39:05,881
Don't take me wrong.
I was standing here.

310
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:08,310
So he came and caught
my hand quietly.

311
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:10,113
Like he knows me.

312
00:39:10,114 --> 00:39:13,514
Go on Raj"
- Raja"

313
00:39:14,085 --> 00:39:17,485
Go to your father my son"
- Raja, come here my dear.

314
00:39:18,055 --> 00:39:24,765
Raja! - My dear, here take
this chocolate. OK.

315
00:39:27,064 --> 00:39:29,614
Very good. Thank you.

316
00:39:40,344 --> 00:39:44,064
Look Raja" if you have to
call me and I'm outside.

317
00:39:44,682 --> 00:39:46,852
You hold this like this and"

318
00:40:17,047 --> 00:40:19,047
Ding dong--

319
00:40:41,138 --> 00:40:43,138
Ding dong--

320
00:40:45,209 --> 00:40:48,019
Now you understood, that
when you have to call me.

321
00:40:48,512 --> 00:40:50,512
Press this like this.

322
00:40:57,154 --> 00:40:59,154
You wait here, I'll
see who it is.

323
00:41:11,101 --> 00:41:14,881
Who are you people?
- oh <i>so</i> who are we?

324
00:41:15,506 --> 00:41:18,726
That won't do.. go and
call your father.

325
00:41:19,276 --> 00:41:22,056
Call your father.
- Call my father.

326
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:25,670
Shall I call my father?
- Hey you refuse to recognise"

327
00:41:26,116 --> 00:41:28,116
...your own father do you.

328
00:41:28,385 --> 00:41:30,385
Go call Saar.. Saar..

329
00:41:32,122 --> 00:41:35,312
I am Saar.. tell me what
can I do for you.

330
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:39,540
So it's you. I thought
it was some old man.

331
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:42,240
But you are young
and handsome too.

332
00:41:43,067 --> 00:41:45,067
You fall for a handsome
face wherever you go..

333
00:41:45,135 --> 00:41:47,415
"Just like slipping
on a banana peel.

334
00:41:48,072 --> 00:41:50,442
Have you come here to
praise his beauty?

335
00:41:51,075 --> 00:41:54,825
Hey where is my kid?
- So he's your kid.

336
00:41:55,479 --> 00:41:57,479
Then do you think I
bought him on rent..

337
00:41:57,481 --> 00:42:01,141
He is my kid.. my love..
my heart.

338
00:42:01,752 --> 00:42:04,362
Who I looked after for
nine months in my womb.

339
00:42:04,822 --> 00:42:07,752
OK you gave birth to him but
I suffered the pain too.

340
00:42:08,259 --> 00:42:10,259
She was giving birth
in the hospital"

341
00:42:10,628 --> 00:42:12,998
"and I was dying in pain.

342
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:16,931
He is the fruit of the pain
we suffered together.

343
00:42:17,434 --> 00:42:19,454
Our Manna" our child.

344
00:42:19,837 --> 00:42:22,617
And you think you will ask
us for money for him.

345
00:42:23,107 --> 00:42:26,767
I won't pay you a single penny,
you coital.. A single penny.

346
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:30,825
Where is my kid..
- Shut up.

347
00:42:31,315 --> 00:42:33,775
Stop this drama. I didn't
steal your son

348
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:36,388
He was lying in a heap of
Garbage on the footpath.

349
00:42:36,787 --> 00:42:38,321
And if I brought him from there.

350
00:42:38,322 --> 00:42:40,372
If I had not done that

351
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:45,656
OK.. let that be. You tell me
where did you son get lost.

352
00:42:46,297 --> 00:42:49,337
There.. what is the name
of that place.. there..

00:42:49,867 --> 00:42:51,501
Tell him.

354
00:42:51,502 --> 00:42:55,222
Why are you asking us questions
like the police?

355
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:57,839
You stole the kid and
brought him here.

356
00:42:58,142 --> 00:42:59,409
And you are bossing over us.

357

00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:07,862
At least a dozen veils have
Become wet with my tears.

360
00:43:08,352 --> 00:43:11,722
Tell me.. my heart is crying out.

361

Otherwise I will give up my
life here. - Hey stop screaming.

Come home my son" I'll

367
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:42,471
Give him to me.. it's been <i>so</i>
many days since I held him.

368
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:45,121
Since I showered him
with affection.

369
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:47,342
Come to me my son.
- Hey..

370
00:43:47,758 --> 00:43:50,628
Come to me..
- Hey don't pull.

371
00:43:51,128 --> 00:43:53,128
Will you take half a son home?

372
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:55,464
Don't you see he's scared?

373
00:43:55,833 --> 00:43:58,933
Who knows what that goon
did to scare him?

374
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:01,470
Now that your father
is here, don't worry.

375
00:44:01,805 --> 00:44:05,645
It's been days since I heard
you calling me mummy.

376
00:44:07,011 --> 00:44:10,821
Listen" call me mummy..
call me mummy.

377
00:44:11,448 --> 00:44:13,878
Just once <i>so</i> that I feel happy.

378
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:18,418
Keep quiet.. it's enough
that you found your son.

379
00:44:19,089 --> 00:44:21,089
We'll take him home and
think of other things. C' Mon.

380
00:44:21,091 --> 00:44:23,281
And we'll hand over this
man to the police.

381
00:44:23,694 --> 00:44:27,234
Oh be quiet" let's take
our son home first.

382
00:44:27,831 --> 00:44:29,831
C' Mon.. you mad woman.

383
00:44:35,039 --> 00:44:39,819
Hey.. <i>so</i> your going. Please go..

384
00:44:40,577 --> 00:44:42,797
But before you go home
tell me what does"

385
00:44:43,213 --> 00:44:49,393
...your Prelacy, Underlain,
Flatware call you?

386
00:44:51,055 --> 00:44:55,535
Does he call you Batu, Pitapat
or some other bad word..

387
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:58,161
Why will he give me bad words?

388
00:44:58,162 --> 00:45:00,622
I send him to a high-class
school.

389
00:45:01,065 --> 00:45:03,615
Do you know that English
school" there.

390
00:45:04,068 --> 00:45:08,548
He doesn't call me bap..
he calls me Daddy. Daddy!

391
00:45:09,273 --> 00:45:11,273
Think once again
how he calls you.

392
00:45:11,308 --> 00:45:13,209
He calls me daddy isn't it?

393
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:15,400
Then..
- Does he call you daddy?

394
00:45:15,813 --> 00:45:18,593
If he doesn't call you dad,
then does he call you daddy?

395
00:45:19,083 --> 00:45:21,103
Ask him to call you once again.

396
00:45:21,485 --> 00:45:25,875
Why? He is my kid, not a toy
that has to be keyed in..

397
00:45:26,590 --> 00:45:30,690
Shut up. Put the kid down..

398
00:45:31,361 --> 00:45:34,111
Why?
- Put him down.. put him down.

399
00:45:36,033 --> 00:45:37,300
Now come with me.

400
00:45:37,301 --> 00:45:39,301
What do you call him?

401
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:42,640
Daddy! - Daddy! - What are you doing?

402
00:45:43,173 --> 00:45:45,283
Hey you took away our child
first and now you hit him too.

403
00:45:45,676 --> 00:45:49,246
Your husband I'll make
mince meat of him.

404
00:45:49,847 --> 00:45:51,847
Why? - Shut up.

405
00:45:53,050 --> 00:45:58,820
Come here. What does he
call you? - Daddy-ii"

406
00:45:59,723 --> 00:46:04,763
Daddy-ii! You cheat,
fraud, conman"

407
00:46:05,562 --> 00:46:09,432
Does he call you daddy
and you mummy..

408
00:46:10,067 --> 00:46:12,067
When he is dumb and
deaf since birth.

409
00:46:13,203 --> 00:46:16,513
And he calls both of
you mummy and daddy..

410
00:46:17,074 --> 00:46:23,784
Now tell me the truth in a
minute or I'll break your teeth.

411
00:46:24,815 --> 00:46:32,115
The truth is that it's been
5 years since we got married.

412
00:46:33,223 --> 00:46:37,443
We tried everything" but
we couldn't have a kid.

413
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:40,648
Then we got to know that
you picked up some kid..

414
00:46:41,098 --> 00:46:43,098
...from the foot path
and brought him here.

415
00:46:43,167 --> 00:46:45,167
So we thought that our
work would be done.

416
00:46:46,370 --> 00:46:52,320
We thought we'll lie to you
and take the kid from you.

417
00:46:53,243 --> 00:46:56,113
So that he becomes our
support in old age.

418
00:46:57,047 --> 00:47:00,207
But how were we to know
that he's dumb and deaf.

419
00:47:00,751 --> 00:47:04,701
His dumbness would open
up our lie like this.

420
00:47:05,355 --> 00:47:07,056
We are mistake. We are very
sorry sir.. we won't"

421
00:47:07,057 --> 00:47:09,367
...make that mistake again.

422
00:47:09,993 --> 00:47:14,913
We won't do it again.
- Quiet" now go.

423
00:47:15,699 --> 00:47:23,609
Listen if you do this again
I'll beat you up very bad.

424
00:47:24,808 --> 00:47:26,808
No..
- Now get lost.

425
00:47:30,013 --> 00:47:33,763
And listen give your husband
groundnut to eat.

426
00:47:34,384 --> 00:47:35,618
Your work will be done.

427
00:47:35,619 --> 00:47:37,220
You wanted a kid..

428
00:47:37,221 --> 00:47:39,651
Raja" come on.

429
00:47:48,198 --> 00:47:53,878
Raja, you were saved today.
Your dumbness saved you.

430
00:47:56,106 --> 00:47:58,296
But what if someone tells
a lie and takes you away.

431
00:47:59,376 --> 00:48:04,416
Please tell me once. Who are you?
who are your parents?

432
00:48:11,355 --> 00:48:13,725
No, I don't understand anything.

433
00:48:15,158 --> 00:48:19,108
This God is weird too.
He takes away parents"

434
00:48:19,763 --> 00:48:21,873
"and sometimes someone's
kid too.

435
00:49:20,324 --> 00:49:23,284

00:50:54,284 --> 00:50:56,864
"I thought of someone I loved."

447
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:59,780
"I had in my heart..

<i>“ AA ran 2000s“ AA ran too..“</i>

475
00:54:27,664 --> 00:54:30,354
He is deaf and dumb
but not blind.

476
00:54:31,368 --> 00:54:34,208
Because they say the one
who has one weakness.

477
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:37,825
God gives him another
quality for that.

478
00:54:39,175 --> 00:54:42,865
So if he is dumb.. then
he will be clever.

479
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:46,360
And if he's deaf then his
Memory will be strong.

480
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:53,780
He has seen us killing us.

481
00:54:55,225 --> 00:54:58,225
Either today or tomorrow he
will make Saar understand"

482
00:55:00,063 --> 00:55:03,253
"and tell him and get us hung.

483
00:55:05,068 --> 00:55:08,258
That is why finish
this story here.

484
00:55:12,008 --> 00:55:14,008
1 rupees my dear.

485
00:55:20,283 --> 00:55:25,933
You.. I think you've left
your father again.

486
00:55:26,823 --> 00:55:29,953
Hey.. he is a poor dumb
and deaf child.

487
00:55:32,362 --> 00:55:35,552
Yes" he found him on footpath.

488
00:55:36,099 --> 00:55:38,099
Avery good man just like God.

489
00:55:38,468 --> 00:55:41,018
He has a beautiful
wife just like you.

490
00:55:41,471 --> 00:55:44,161
But god couldn't see him happy"

491
00:55:48,044 --> 00:55:50,044
Raja"

492
00:55:55,118 --> 00:55:57,668
It's amazing.. he's
near you again.

493
00:55:58,121 --> 00:56:00,055
Did you see mother" he left
my hand"

494
00:56:00,056 --> 00:56:02,056
"and came here. Come with me Raja"

495
00:56:02,992 --> 00:56:05,802
This is amazing. He catches
you wherever he sees you.

496
00:56:06,996 --> 00:56:09,136
Come here.. Raja. Chocolate"

497
00:56:09,532 --> 00:56:13,952
No..
- I stay close by.

498
00:56:14,671 --> 00:56:17,661
Why don't you come to my
house before going home?

499
00:56:19,075 --> 00:56:22,265
I think he must have a relation
to me in his last birth.

500
00:56:23,012 --> 00:56:25,622
Come on. God knows what
Happens to him..

501
00:56:26,082 --> 00:56:28,632
...when he sees you.
OK let's go..

502
00:56:45,034 --> 00:56:47,034

Come"

504
00:57:03,987 --> 00:57:05,987
This is my poor home.

505
00:57:07,190 --> 00:57:09,710
If god gives every poor
man a house like you.

506
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:12,160
Then he won't be poor anymore.

507
00:57:12,996 --> 00:57:15,106
Your house is just
like a palace.

508
00:57:15,498 --> 00:57:18,308
Thank you <i>so</i> much. Sit down..

509
00:57:18,802 --> 00:57:22,492
Thank you.
- So what will you have?

Tea or some cold drink.

511
00:57:24,474 --> 00:57:29,454
By the way I make very good
tea. - I'll have tea. - OK.

512

Thank you.

514
00:58:47,023 --> 00:58:49,023
Where is Raja?

515
00:59:04,974 --> 00:59:07,584
Raja, what did you do?
You broke the frame.

516
00:59:08,044 --> 00:59:10,234
Don't touch things at other
people's house understand?

517
00:59:10,647 --> 00:59:13,107
Why are you scolding him
for such a small matter?

518
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:15,051

C' Mon Raja"

520
00:59:19,789 --> 00:59:21,929
It's OK my dear, I'll get
another glass for it.

521
00:59:24,994 --> 00:59:28,834
Whose snap is this?
- This is my sister Deena.

522
00:59:29,465 --> 00:59:32,245
5 years ago she married
a Christian boy.

523
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:34,735
My dad was very angry.
After marriage they"

524
00:59:35,071 --> 00:59:37,381
"somewhere far from this city.

525
00:59:37,807 --> 00:59:39,807
And from that time I don't
know where they are.

526
00:59:40,310 --> 00:59:43,000
And this is my father. He works
in Reyna international.

527
00:59:43,479 --> 00:59:45,479
25 days of a month he's on tour.

528
00:59:45,748 --> 00:59:47,918
And my servant Kampala

Now this is my introduction.
Now tell me about yourself.

00:59:52,355 --> 00:59:54,665
You didn't tell
me your name yet.

531
00:59:55,091 --> 00:59:58,191
What is your name?
- You loving talking don't you?

532
00:59:58,728 --> 01:00:02,478
Yes. - If it's up-to me I'll

533
01:00:03,099 --> 01:00:05,649
What to do.. stay alone
at home I'm fed up of it.

534
01:00:06,102 --> 01:00:08,712
So tell me what is your
name and what do you do?

535
01:00:09,172 --> 01:00:12,212

And I love people who are sad.

539
01:00:22,719 --> 01:00:25,329
And I also love the
pain of my past.

540
01:00:30,059 --> 01:00:32,059
Why are you looking at me
like that? - Nothing.

541
01:00:33,062 --> 01:00:35,062
Just a minute"

542
01:00:38,101 --> 01:00:42,021
This is from me to you Raja"
- Why.. what's the occasion?

543
01:00:42,672 --> 01:00:44,640
There is no reason
for being happy.

544
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:46,142
He just feels like my own.

545
01:00:46,142 --> 01:00:48,142

"I want a lover beautiful like God."

608
01:08:56,866 --> 01:08:58,886
"I am adorer of love."

609
01:09:00,870 --> 01:09:02,870
"I need love."

610
01:09:04,874 --> 01:09:06,874
"Love.. Love."

611
01:09:07,042 --> 01:09:09,042
"Love.. Love."

612
01:09:09,044 --> 01:09:11,044
"Love.. Love."

613
01:09:11,046 --> 01:09:13,046
"Love.. Love."

614
01:09:32,301 --> 01:09:36,611
Raja, if you could hear and
if you heard my story.

615
01:09:38,908 --> 01:09:42,338
You would cry. But
the one who wrote..

616
01:09:42,912 --> 01:09:45,162
"The story of my life.. he.. God.

617
01:09:48,250 --> 01:09:50,250
He has been laughing at
me since the beginning.

618
01:09:52,188 --> 01:09:56,548
He didn't cry. He couldn't have
shed a tear of pity for me.

619
01:10:00,296 --> 01:10:04,806
Raja, since I became young.
I just knew that I was alone.

620
01:10:08,204 --> 01:10:10,204
Like a branch broken from its roots.

621
01:10:11,974 --> 01:10:13,974
I didn't have any relatives.

622
01:10:15,878 --> 01:10:18,128
And I was also thrown near
a dustbin just like you.

623
01:10:22,151 --> 01:10:24,151
People say someone left me there.

624
01:10:25,321 --> 01:10:27,491
Thinking I was garbage.
And this garbage..

625
01:10:27,890 --> 01:10:30,580
"Brought himself up.

626
01:10:32,061 --> 01:10:35,491
Being a mother and father to myself.

627
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:41,920
When I became sad I cried
on my own shoulder.

628
01:10:44,340 --> 01:10:46,510
When my heart broke I would
take loneliness to bed..

629
01:10:46,909 --> 01:10:49,159
"Imagining it to
be my mother's lap.

630
01:10:52,381 --> 01:10:55,891
Sorrows were my friends and
loneliness my partner.

631
01:10:58,954 --> 01:11:00,954
I became young with these two.

632
01:11:12,001 --> 01:11:15,461
And then I found a partner
for my loneliness.

633
01:11:17,039 --> 01:11:21,639
Yes" come on..

634
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:46,400
She didn't have anyone just like me.

635
01:11:47,069 --> 01:11:49,069
When two lonely people
met each other.

636
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:53,240
Their loneliness vanishes
and we got married.

637
01:11:55,177 --> 01:11:57,727
And one day she told me I
was going to be a father.

638
01:12:00,182 --> 01:12:02,182
And I had become crazy
with happiness.

639
01:12:03,285 --> 01:12:07,535
And I built castles in the air
and I named the child too.

640
01:12:08,957 --> 01:12:10,858
Raja" and that day arrived
when my child"

641
01:12:10,859 --> 01:12:16,629
...would come to this world.
18th November.

642
01:12:19,201 --> 01:12:21,201
When the doctors took her
to the operation theater.

643
01:12:22,037 --> 01:12:24,037
I was waiting outside
like a mad man.

644
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:26,875
And then I got to know that
she really became"

645
01:12:26,875 --> 01:12:28,875
"mad while giving
birth to my child.

646
01:12:31,313 --> 01:12:33,623
In her madness she didn't
let me touch her kid.

647
01:12:36,051 --> 01:12:38,051
I always yearned to
hold him in my arms.

648
01:12:41,223 --> 01:12:43,223
But I never got a
chance to hold him.

649
01:12:46,061 --> 01:12:49,631
As time passed by.. her
madness didn't decrease.

650
01:12:52,234 --> 01:12:54,234
Instead she contracted
another disease.

651
01:12:55,904 --> 01:12:57,904
She had jaundice.

652
01:12:59,241 --> 01:13:01,241
The doctor told her not
to breast feed the child.

653
01:13:01,310 --> 01:13:03,310
But she didn't listen to anyone.

654
01:13:04,079 --> 01:13:06,079
She fed the child too.

655
01:13:08,083 --> 01:13:09,918
And finally that illness
took away Sheila..

656
01:13:09,918 --> 01:13:11,918
"And my son contracted
that disease too.

657
01:13:15,090 --> 01:13:17,640
I went everywhere with that child.

658
01:13:20,095 --> 01:13:22,095
To every place where there
was a ray of hope.

659
01:13:25,434 --> 01:13:27,984
In the last three days my
child cried the whole day.

660
01:13:30,305 --> 01:13:34,585
And when he slept" he
didn't wake up again.

661
01:13:36,278 --> 01:13:38,278
And I screamed out loud. No..

662
01:13:39,348 --> 01:13:41,348
No..

663
01:13:43,285 --> 01:13:45,685
I told God, don't take
away my world from me.

664
01:13:47,122 --> 01:13:49,962
I have built my world bit
by bit. Don't take it away.

665
01:13:50,459 --> 01:13:52,459
Don't take it away.

666
01:14:05,073 --> 01:14:07,073
What all that mad woman had
collected for her child.

667
01:14:10,078 --> 01:14:12,628
This small sweater, these socks"

668
01:14:14,082 --> 01:14:16,922
This cradle of love. And these toys.

669
01:14:21,423 --> 01:14:25,583
Do you see this Raja" this
is a very pure place.

670
01:14:28,263 --> 01:14:30,663
This room is a tomb
of my broken dreams.

671
01:14:34,102 --> 01:14:38,262
But since I found you I feel
like I have the key..

672
01:14:38,941 --> 01:14:42,511
"That will fulfill my dreams.

673
01:14:45,113 --> 01:14:48,983
My child was taken away <i>3</i> years ago.

674
01:14:51,220 --> 01:14:53,220
Fate has brought him back to me.

675
01:14:54,990 --> 01:14:56,990
That is why I'm crazy about you.

676
01:14:58,160 --> 01:15:01,790
That is why I'm crazy
about you. My child"

677
01:15:04,399 --> 01:15:07,529
You are the direction to
my directionless life.

678
01:15:12,074 --> 01:15:16,824
But you don't worry. Don't worry.

679
01:15:31,260 --> 01:15:35,860
Worry.. don't worry..

680
01:15:37,933 --> 01:15:39,933
Ya.. ya.

681
01:20:20,051 --> 01:20:23,771
Raja, I will never
touch liquor again.

682
01:20:27,392 --> 01:20:30,962
These hands couldn't
touch my own child.

683
01:20:32,897 --> 01:20:34,897
So they held liquor till now.

684
01:20:36,234 --> 01:20:39,074
But now they will go
away from liquor.

685
01:20:41,272 --> 01:20:43,642
And with these hand
will protect my Raja.

686
01:20:44,075 --> 01:20:46,075
And bring him up.

687
01:21:21,045 --> 01:21:25,495
God.. after years
I have come to you.

688
01:21:28,219 --> 01:21:30,219
I have come to bow down before you.

689
01:21:33,992 --> 01:21:39,232
I had lost everything God.
I had rebelled against you.

690
01:21:42,066 --> 01:21:44,066
Today I have a new direction.

691
01:21:46,070 --> 01:21:50,320
With this innocent kids love
I have come out of darkness.

692
01:21:54,012 --> 01:22:00,082
God, I think of him as my son. Now..

693
01:22:03,021 --> 01:22:05,021
Now don't take him away from me.

694
01:22:05,256 --> 01:22:08,626
Please protect him and keep
him away from harm.

695
01:22:12,196 --> 01:22:14,596
Raja" pray to God..

696
01:22:51,069 --> 01:22:53,069
I want to meet Father Joseph
Sebastian. - One minute sir..

697
01:23:04,415 --> 01:23:06,415
Good morning father.
- Good morning.

698
01:23:07,085 --> 01:23:09,635
You.. are you Mr. Kalashnikov"
- Yes.

699
01:23:10,088 --> 01:23:12,088
When did you come here?
- This morning.

700
01:23:13,091 --> 01:23:15,091
Come with me.

701
01:23:20,031 --> 01:23:22,031
Sit down..

702
01:23:27,271 --> 01:23:29,671
I had to call you suddenly
Because of your daughter.

703
01:23:31,109 --> 01:23:33,109
Since Michael died
in a car accident.

704
01:23:34,445 --> 01:23:36,445
I couldn't see your
daughter suffering.

705
01:23:37,949 --> 01:23:39,949
I was compelled <i>so</i> I wrote
a letter to you.

706
01:23:41,119 --> 01:23:44,549
So that I could get the
two of you together.

707
01:23:45,123 --> 01:23:47,123
I hate myself father.

708
01:23:48,126 --> 01:23:49,961
I cursed my daughter that
she would never..

709
01:23:49,961 --> 01:23:52,591
...be happy by hurting her father.

710
01:23:54,065 --> 01:23:57,635
That was such a bad
time and what I said.

711
01:23:58,236 --> 01:24:00,236
And my daughter's family
has been torn apart.

712
01:24:01,305 --> 01:24:03,073
I want to set my mistakes right.

713
01:24:03,074 --> 01:24:05,074
And <i>so</i> I went to Deena’s house.

714
01:24:06,077 --> 01:24:08,077
But it was locked.
- Locked"

715
01:24:09,080 --> 01:24:11,190
Yes it's possible she could
have gone to Rune. - Rune!

716
01:24:12,250 --> 01:24:13,918
Yes.. it's possible she went
there to meet sister Mary"

717
01:24:13,918 --> 01:24:15,918
...to St. Sebastian Church.

718
01:24:16,087 --> 01:24:18,087
I'll go there immediately.
Thank you very much father.

719
01:24:21,259 --> 01:24:23,809
Father, how old would
my grandson be now.

720
01:24:24,262 --> 01:24:26,262
Do you want to see your grandson?

721
01:24:29,100 --> 01:24:31,100
Look, this is his snap.

722
01:24:32,937 --> 01:24:34,937
Wan.

723
01:24:36,274 --> 01:24:38,274

No, I'm fine.

742

Does Raja sleep <i>so</i> early
in the evening?

743
01:27:23,307 --> 01:27:25,937
Now there's nothing
<i>so</i> we sleep early.

744
01:27:27,411 --> 01:27:29,661
I'll make tea for you.
- No, don't take the trouble.

745

No trouble" you've
come to our house.

You get up too.
- Run!

God knows where these kids
come from. - Aunt..

809
01:34:45,282 --> 01:34:47,282
What is it?
- Is there an iron smith here?

810
01:34:47,951 --> 01:34:49,285
There it is.

811
01:34:49,286 --> 01:34:51,286

Ah..

816
01:35:28,258 --> 01:35:34,178
Oh <i>so</i> it's you.. that day
you wore good clothes.

817
01:35:36,099 --> 01:35:38,649
And looked quite good. And today..
you're body is bare.

818
01:35:39,102 --> 01:35:40,436
And face has become black.

819
01:35:40,437 --> 01:35:42,437
And you're shivering like
a wet cat before the fire.

820
01:35:42,940 --> 01:35:44,940
What's the story behind this?

821
01:35:45,275 --> 01:35:47,965
Sir, you slapped me
<i>so</i> hard that day.

822
01:35:49,446 --> 01:35:51,636
Even I don't hit the iron <i>so</i> hard.

823
01:35:53,317 --> 01:35:55,927
Sir, my neck is still
stuck in that position.

824
01:35:57,221 --> 01:35:59,471
And when I try to turn
my head it creaks"

825
01:35:59,890 --> 01:36:01,890
...like an old wooden door.

826
01:36:08,232 --> 01:36:10,632
Really" I'll get it out for you.

827
01:36:11,068 --> 01:36:13,818
I would be <i>so</i> happy
if you do it for me.

828
01:36:14,905 --> 01:36:16,905
Do you want me to get you
a cold drink or something?

829
01:36:17,241 --> 01:36:19,491
Have it and go away quickly
<i>so</i> that I don't have to..

830
01:36:19,910 --> 01:36:21,910
"Shiver in fright sitting
in front of the fire.

831
01:36:26,083 --> 01:36:28,083
Oh let all that be. I
had some work with you.

832
01:36:29,419 --> 01:36:31,669
This wheel cap is broken
please repair it for me.

833
01:36:37,094 --> 01:36:40,084
"Forget the past."

834
01:36:40,931 --> 01:36:42,931
"Make your conscience clear."

835
01:36:45,102 --> 01:36:48,972
Listen, did you do anything
else to become a father.

836
01:36:49,940 --> 01:36:51,940
Oh why are you bringing
that up again?

837
01:36:52,042 --> 01:36:56,792
Why are you adding to my wounds?
Forget that thing.

838
01:36:58,215 --> 01:37:00,905
I did all that just for the kid.

839
01:37:01,985 --> 01:37:03,886
Otherwise do you think
I am a fool to come"

840
01:37:03,887 --> 01:37:06,137
...to your house to
get beaten by you.

841
01:37:08,225 --> 01:37:13,525
If you want a kid so bad you
could go to the orphanage.

842
01:37:15,232 --> 01:37:17,922
I did go to the orphanage.
But they refused.

843
01:37:19,236 --> 01:37:21,236
They said that we give a kid
after seeing the person.

844
01:37:22,306 --> 01:37:24,646
And our orphanage is better
than your house.

845
01:37:26,076 --> 01:37:29,506
And if you want you can
come and stay here too.

846
01:37:30,080 --> 01:37:32,080
They insulted me.

847
01:37:34,918 --> 01:37:37,608
Where is your wife?
- Oh she's inside. I'll call her.

848
01:37:38,088 --> 01:37:42,538
Hey pregnant woman, oh beauty"
my love.. come out.

849
01:37:44,261 --> 01:37:46,661
Why are you screaming?
- Hey listen"

850
01:37:47,931 --> 01:37:49,931
Look, who's here..

851
01:37:55,272 --> 01:37:57,272
You.. how come you're here today"

852
01:37:57,874 --> 01:37:59,208
Look she's falling for you again.

853
01:37:59,209 --> 01:38:04,249
Listen are you giving your husband
that soup I told you.

854
01:38:06,049 --> 01:38:08,799
What are you saying?
- Look, there she goes again.

855
01:38:10,887 --> 01:38:12,887
Here, it's done.

856
01:38:14,057 --> 01:38:17,927
Take this" - Actually I need it..
but why did you have to give.

857
01:38:18,895 --> 01:38:20,915
OK then" come back some other time.

858
01:38:21,298 --> 01:38:24,518
Oh yes I will surely come back.
- I was just joking.

859
01:38:25,068 --> 01:38:27,068
Why do you have to come back?

860
01:39:03,874 --> 01:39:05,874
Hey"

861
01:39:10,280 --> 01:39:13,710
Did you recognise me? you
look quite decent today.

862
01:39:14,885 --> 01:39:16,885
Have you forgotten
your friends today?

863
01:39:19,056 --> 01:39:22,926
Remember we met in the
bar on 18th November.

864
01:39:23,894 --> 01:39:25,894
Oh yes" how are you friend?

865
01:39:26,063 --> 01:39:29,663
That day I had a lot to drink.
Any way we'll meet again.

866
01:39:32,269 --> 01:39:34,639
Sir, we won't get time again.
We are in the mood today.

867
01:39:35,072 --> 01:39:37,072
Come let's have a drink today.

868
01:39:37,240 --> 01:39:39,240

No.. He is accused of
hitting a police man.

01:57:22,071 --> 01:57:24,071
He was brought her for questioning.

989
01:57:25,241 --> 01:57:27,241
He will have to go back
to the police station.

990
01:57:28,244 --> 01:57:30,244
And Mr. Kalashnikov you can go too.

991

They are my neighbor’s kids.
You know don't have kids.

1004
01:59:17,052 --> 01:59:19,052
They come here in the evening.

And call me father" just like that.

1006
01:59:21,056 --> 01:59:23,056

Who sent you to kidnap my kid..

Sir, I swear on all my kids
I don't know who he is.

1012
01:59:50,252 --> 01:59:53,032
He just gave me 1000
rupees for this work.

1013
01:59:54,857 --> 01:59:57,547
How did he look?
- He looked very dangerous.

1014
01:59:58,027 --> 02:00:03,247
A long face, like a horse
and a beard too.

1015
02:00:04,066 --> 02:00:06,786
He had red eyes and his
hair was everywhere.

1016
02:00:07,269 --> 02:00:09,269
He looked like a murderer.

1017
02:01:06,261 --> 02:01:08,261
It is he, isn't it?
- Yes, it's him.

1018

Definitely. You made
him just like he is.

Take it away from
me because I feel..

1020
02:01:12,868 --> 02:01:14,868
...like he is right here
in front of me.

1021
02:01:17,039 --> 02:01:20,469
Sir, there is a man called Saar
who wants to meet you.

1022
02:01:21,043 --> 02:01:23,153

What will you have?

For what did they jail you..

They jailed me for saving a child.

1030
02:01:57,179 --> 02:02:00,899
It's amazing, but how
did you come here?

1031
02:02:08,190 --> 02:02:11,470
Does a man like him work
in your factory? - No..

1032
02:02:13,028 --> 02:02:15,028
Are you sure?
- 100%.

1033
02:02:17,032 --> 02:02:19,032
Look at him and tell me once again.

1034
02:02:19,368 --> 02:02:21,368
I just told you I don't know
any man who looks like him.

1035
02:02:35,050 --> 02:02:37,050

1037
02:02:39,888 --> 02:02:41,222
...to begin Mr. Surrender Moran.

1038
02:02:41,223 --> 02:02:42,891
Don't talk rubbish. Do you know..

1039
02:02:42,891 --> 02:02:44,392
...whom you're speaking to?

1040
02:02:44,393 --> 02:02:46,393
I don't talk to people
without an appointment.

1041
02:02:47,229 --> 02:02:49,229
And I beat up people without
an appointment.

1042
02:02:51,233 --> 02:02:53,067
And I know it quite well
that you know this man.

1043
02:02:53,068 --> 02:02:56,058
I am going now.. but I will
show this picture to the kid.

1044
02:02:57,239 --> 02:02:59,639
And very soon I will
have you unmasked.

1045
02:03:00,075 --> 02:03:02,625
And I will get you to tell us
the truth. - I say" get out.

1046
02:03:03,078 --> 02:03:05,628
I'm leaving" but you be ready.

1047
02:03:40,115 --> 02:03:43,985
You.. why have you come here?

1048
02:03:46,955 --> 02:03:48,955
I need to see Raja.
- Why?

1049
02:03:49,124 --> 02:03:51,494
I need to know something from him.
- Really

1050
02:03:52,928 --> 02:03:54,928
That is why you ran
from police custody.

1051
02:03:56,064 --> 02:03:58,064
Go from her and don't
come here again.

1052
02:03:58,066 --> 02:04:00,616
Please, let me meet him once.
It's very important.

1053
02:04:01,069 --> 02:04:03,909
If it's important, go and
surrender to the police.

1054
02:04:04,907 --> 02:04:06,241
And then come here with them.

1055
02:04:06,241 --> 02:04:07,909
People running from the
police don't have the..

1056
02:04:07,910 --> 02:04:10,810
...permission to come to my
house nor meet my grandson.

1057
02:04:12,314 --> 02:04:14,804
Sir, please do me a favour
and let me meet Raja.

1058
02:04:15,250 --> 02:04:17,250
Just once.. let me meet Raja.
- No..

1059
02:04:17,920 --> 02:04:20,170
And if you insist then I will
be forced to call the police.

1060
02:04:20,923 --> 02:04:22,923
What will you do calling the police?

1061
02:04:22,925 --> 02:04:24,426
Why are you threatening me with
the police now and then?

1062
02:04:24,426 --> 02:04:26,426
I am requesting you and
you are threatening me.

1063
02:04:27,095 --> 02:04:28,429
Fine, I'll go back but I warn you.

1064
02:04:28,430 --> 02:04:30,540
If something happens to
Raja" then I won't..

1065
02:04:30,933 --> 02:04:33,833
"Spare you and your daughter
too, Mr. Kalashnikov.

1066
02:05:02,297 --> 02:05:03,898
Saar..
- What is it?

1067
02:05:03,899 --> 02:05:07,029
Father is a little worried..
<i>so</i> he was hard on you.

1068
02:05:07,903 --> 02:05:09,903
Why? What did I ask from him?

1069
02:05:10,072 --> 02:05:11,907
Did I ask for a share
in his property"

1070
02:05:11,907 --> 02:05:15,477
...or did I come to steal something.

1071
02:05:17,246 --> 02:05:21,406
He is worried.. 5 years ago
he threw his daughter out.

1072
02:05:22,084 --> 02:05:24,084
And didn't see her face again.

1073
02:05:24,186 --> 02:05:26,186
And suddenly now he has developed..

1074
02:05:26,321 --> 02:05:28,321
"Feelings for his daughter's son.

1075
02:05:29,458 --> 02:05:33,648
Where was he when Raja
was in a garbage dump?

1076
02:05:34,930 --> 02:05:37,480
Where was he then?
- Please Saar, I'll apologise"

1077
02:05:37,933 --> 02:05:39,933
...on his behalf to you.

1078
02:05:40,102 --> 02:05:41,336
Did I run from the police for me?

1079
02:05:41,336 --> 02:05:44,996
My case was over when they
found your sister's body.

1080
02:05:46,942 --> 02:05:48,276
But I am worried about Raja.

1081
02:05:48,277 --> 02:05:51,677
And I am looking for the man
who murdered his mother.

1082
02:07:06,888 --> 02:07:08,888
Why did you come here
<i>so</i> late at night?

1083
02:07:10,058 --> 02:07:15,248
Sana, I wanted to show this
photo to Raja" - Who is he?

1084
02:07:16,064 --> 02:07:18,464
I don't know for sure
but I think he is..

1085
02:07:18,900 --> 02:07:22,440
...the same man who
killed your sister.

1086
02:07:23,038 --> 02:07:26,498
And this man also has a
handicap man with him.

1087
02:07:28,076 --> 02:07:29,911
They know that Raja
recognizes him well.

1088
02:07:29,911 --> 02:07:32,021
So they want to kill Raja.

1089
02:07:33,415 --> 02:07:36,545
Give it to me.. I'll
show this to Raja.

1090
02:07:37,085 --> 02:07:40,075
And if he recognizes him then
I'll bring him myself to you.

1091
02:07:40,922 --> 02:07:42,922
But where and when?
- Tomorrow at 6 o'clock"

1092
02:07:42,924 --> 02:07:45,914
"at Huh Departmental Store.
- Fine.. I'll wait for you.

1093
02:07:47,429 --> 02:07:52,259
Sana.. I was angry at
you without a reason.

1094
02:07:53,034 --> 02:07:55,034
Please forgive me.

1095
02:08:11,887 --> 02:08:13,887
Raja"

1096
02:08:19,294 --> 02:08:26,914
Raja" do you know him?

1097
02:08:41,917 --> 02:08:43,917
Good morning Inspector.

1098
02:08:45,921 --> 02:08:49,051
Very good morning. I have
just come from your office.

1099
02:08:51,860 --> 02:08:53,860
Come sit down..

1100
02:09:09,211 --> 02:09:11,611
Now tell me what can I do for you?

1101
02:09:14,049 --> 02:09:16,049
How many people work in your office.

1102
02:09:19,387 --> 02:09:21,637
Say around 300. but what
is the matter Inspector.

1103
02:09:22,057 --> 02:09:25,047
I need to speak to them
regarding Deena's murder.

1104
02:09:26,228 --> 02:09:30,388
Deena" who is Deena.
- Not is.. was.

1105
02:09:32,067 --> 02:09:35,787
She and your manager Moran
was killed on the same day.

1106
02:09:36,404 --> 02:09:39,534
With the same knife, in the
same way by the same man.

1107
02:09:40,909 --> 02:09:42,909
I don't know who killed Moran.

1108
02:09:44,079 --> 02:09:48,389
But Deena's four-year-old kid
knows who killed his mother.

1109
02:09:50,085 --> 02:09:52,085
He is the witness to this murder.

1110
02:09:53,255 --> 02:09:55,885
If he is shown all the workers
from your factory.

1111
02:09:56,858 --> 02:09:59,548
It's possible that the kid..
- No absolutely not.

1112
02:10:00,028 --> 02:10:02,028
Such identification is not
done in our factory.

1113
02:10:02,864 --> 02:10:04,864
This will give a bad
name to our company.

1114
02:10:05,033 --> 02:10:06,867
It will be much better Mr.
Surrender Moran"

1115
02:10:06,868 --> 02:10:13,078
...that you help us otherwise
if I have to use my ways.

1116
02:10:14,042 --> 02:10:16,042
Then you will get a
bad name definitely.

1117
02:10:18,213 --> 02:10:20,213
But this is possible
only on a Monday.

1118
02:10:20,215 --> 02:10:23,695
And we have <i>3</i> shifts. If you
have to meet everyone.

1119
02:10:24,286 --> 02:10:26,054
Then it will take you 2 days.
- Fine..

1120
02:10:26,054 --> 02:10:28,454
So on Monday from 7.30
to 9.30 we'll have"

1121
02:10:28,890 --> 02:10:32,460
...a recognition parade. OK.
- OK.

1122
02:10:40,068 --> 02:10:42,818
Mr. Surrender Moran, I need to
ask you a personal question

1123
02:10:45,907 --> 02:10:48,017
Tell me..
- Where is your wife?

1124
02:10:50,412 --> 02:10:52,602
She is in Switzerland.
- When did she go?

1125
02:10:54,015 --> 02:10:56,855
It's been a month.
- And when will she be back?

1126
02:10:57,852 --> 02:10:59,852
After two months.

1127
02:10:59,854 --> 02:11:01,854
One last question"

1128
02:11:02,257 --> 02:11:04,257
Is it true that before
Moran was murdered.

1129
02:11:04,960 --> 02:11:06,361
He had an illicit relation
to your wife.

1130
02:11:06,361 --> 02:11:08,196
Oh shut up.. inspector Shook Gupta.

1131
02:11:08,196 --> 02:11:09,330
Don't forget your status.

1132
02:11:09,331 --> 02:11:11,821
These are rumors. And it's
true I didn't believe them.

1133
02:11:12,267 --> 02:11:14,267
But my wife felt bad
about these rumors.

1134
02:11:14,269 --> 02:11:16,269
So she went to Switzerland
for a change.

1135
02:11:16,871 --> 02:11:18,981
Now get out..
- Fine.

1136
02:11:19,874 --> 02:11:21,874
But before I leave I'll
remind you once again.

1137
02:11:22,043 --> 02:11:24,883
That you will also be in the
parade with your employees.

1138
02:11:26,381 --> 02:11:28,631
So get everything organized.
I'll see you on Monday.

1139
02:11:35,056 --> 02:11:38,486
Jillian. did you hear that?
- Yes.

1140
02:11:39,060 --> 02:11:41,580
Now what should we do?
- We have just 36 hours,

1141
02:11:42,030 --> 02:11:44,030
In these 36 hours get
that child her somehow.

1142
02:11:45,400 --> 02:11:46,901
Once that child is with
us that inspector won't..

1143
02:11:46,901 --> 02:11:48,901
...be able to come to our office.

1144
02:11:49,270 --> 02:11:50,838
And Saar will get trapped when..

1145
02:11:50,839 --> 02:11:52,839
...he <i>comes</i> looking for that child.

1146
02:11:53,008 --> 02:11:55,008
And I'll take care
of the rest now go.

1147
02:12:01,016 --> 02:12:03,016
I'm leaving, but don't forget
to lock the door from inside.

1148
02:12:03,351 --> 02:12:06,481
Yes daddy.
- And my dear Raja, I'm leaving.

1149
02:12:07,022 --> 02:12:09,022
Won't you say bile?

1150
02:12:10,859 --> 02:12:12,859
Oh wow.

1151
02:12:12,861 --> 02:12:14,362
After all who's grandson is he?

1152
02:12:14,362 --> 02:12:16,362
OK my dear bye.
- Bye.

1153
02:12:22,037 --> 02:12:24,037
Bye..
- Bye.

1154
02:12:41,890 --> 02:12:43,890
Yes please"
- Just like that. - Hey..

1155
02:16:04,893 --> 02:16:06,893
Kampala"

1156
02:16:07,896 --> 02:16:09,896
Kampala"

1157
02:16:10,899 --> 02:16:12,899
Kampala"

1158
02:20:15,276 --> 02:20:17,276
Raja"

1159
02:20:45,439 --> 02:20:48,979
Why are you acting like kids?
I have your life in my hands.

1160
02:20:52,180 --> 02:20:54,180
C' Mon I need to talk
business with you.

1161
02:20:55,850 --> 02:20:57,850
Transit, you will drive the car.

1162
02:21:10,865 --> 02:21:12,865
Sit down.

1163
02:21:19,207 --> 02:21:21,207
No.. you love the child
very much don't you.

1164
02:21:21,876 --> 02:21:23,876
Sit down nicely.

1165
02:21:43,231 --> 02:21:46,801
If the person dies where
his heart lies.

1166
02:21:47,401 --> 02:21:49,651
Then his soul finds
peace after death.

1167
02:21:54,008 --> 02:21:57,728
This room has many sweet
memories of your past.

1168
02:22:00,348 --> 02:22:02,458
Today, I have brought
you here to send you..

1169
02:22:02,850 --> 02:22:04,960
...to your wife and son wrapped
in these memories.

1170
02:22:08,222 --> 02:22:10,882
Did you see? There's lightning too.

1171
02:22:11,859 --> 02:22:14,549
I think they are very eager
to have you there.

1172
02:22:16,030 --> 02:22:18,030
So to go there I'll
show you a shortcut.

1173
02:22:19,367 --> 02:22:21,367
Put this noose around your neck.

1174
02:22:22,203 --> 02:22:24,203
You will feel just a twinge
but you'll be with them soon.

1175
02:22:26,207 --> 02:22:28,207
Mr. Saar, now that you are going.

1176
02:22:29,277 --> 02:22:31,617
I want to clear everything
Between us.

1177
02:22:32,880 --> 02:22:36,010
I don't want to leave
any doubt in your mind.

1178
02:22:40,888 --> 02:22:42,888
Do you know why I murdered my wife?

1179
02:22:45,059 --> 02:22:47,459
Like you I loved my wife too.
But I kept loving her..

1180
02:22:47,895 --> 02:22:51,465
...and she had an illicit
relation with my manager.

1181
02:22:52,066 --> 02:22:54,066
She kept cheating me.

1182
02:22:54,902 --> 02:22:56,902
And when I got to know
I murdered her.

1183
02:22:57,071 --> 02:22:59,621
And threw his body in the sea.

1184
02:23:01,075 --> 02:23:03,075
And now that I'm a businessman.

1185
02:23:03,077 --> 02:23:05,077
Like the accounts, I clean up
evidences of my crime too.

1186
02:23:05,913 --> 02:23:07,913
And because you know my secret.

1187
02:23:08,082 --> 02:23:10,082
I am going to kill you too.

1188
02:23:12,253 --> 02:23:14,253
Now come on.. wear this noose.

1189
02:23:17,091 --> 02:23:19,201
What are you thinking? Don't
worry about this kid.

1190
02:23:20,261 --> 02:23:21,996
I will have your last
rites performed by him.

1191
02:23:21,996 --> 02:23:23,996
And then admit him in an orphanage.

1192
02:23:25,099 --> 02:23:27,499
And people will think a man who
cried for his wife and son.

1193
02:23:27,935 --> 02:23:29,935
Committed suicide
and killed himself.

1194
02:23:35,276 --> 02:23:40,316
Don't waste time or I'll kill this
innocent child just like that.

1195
02:23:41,115 --> 02:23:46,305
And if Transit throws him down
then if he doesn't die.

1196
02:23:47,121 --> 02:23:49,121
Then he will surely
Become handicapped.

1197
02:23:57,064 --> 02:23:59,064
Quickly or..

1198
02:24:01,302 --> 02:24:03,302
Raja is in Ranis hand
and I have the gun,.

1199
02:24:07,908 --> 02:24:09,908
Common..

1200
02:24:15,916 --> 02:24:17,916
Jillian.

1201
02:25:34,261 --> 02:25:36,661
Raja" take"

1202
02:25:39,099 --> 02:25:41,099
Raja" take"

1203
02:25:51,045 --> 02:25:53,045
Raja" run.

02:26:14,902 --> 02:26:16,902
Hail Babar Mason.

Hail Babar Mason.

1206
02:27:45,092 --> 02:27:47,932
Like every man has his name
written on every grain.

1207
02:27:49,296 --> 02:27:52,776
In the same way every noose
has a name written on it.

1208
02:27:54,368 --> 02:27:56,368
And your pot of sins is full too.

1209
02:27:57,204 --> 02:27:59,204
So it's time for you to die too.

1210
02:28:12,886 --> 02:28:14,886
Come on climb up.

1211
02:28:22,062 --> 02:28:24,612
Why, you are afraid
of your death too.

1212
02:28:49,923 --> 02:28:51,923
'No.. no..

1213
02:29:00,267 --> 02:29:03,047
No.. let me go.
- Let me go..

1214
02:29:12,279 --> 02:29:14,279
Leave me. Leave..

1215
02:30:23,884 --> 02:30:25,285
I'm sorry Mr. Saar.

1216
02:30:25,285 --> 02:30:28,065
You had to face such difficulty
Because of our mistake.

1217
02:30:28,889 --> 02:30:30,223
It's OK inspector.

1218
02:30:30,224 --> 02:30:32,224
Constable, take him away.

1219
02:30:40,067 --> 02:30:43,057
But for the legal proceedings,
you'll have to come with us.

1220
02:30:43,904 --> 02:30:45,904
Come"

1221
02:30:47,307 --> 02:30:49,937
"if you need something."

1222
02:30:54,348 --> 02:30:56,898
"My heart is at your service."

1223
02:30:57,851 --> 02:30:59,851
"Take" take."
