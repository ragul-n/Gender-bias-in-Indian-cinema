1
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:24,991
India and China are the future
of the world.

2
00:00:25,091 --> 00:00:27,992
Half of India's
population is under 30.

3
00:00:28,428 --> 00:00:31,397
That means 500 million
young Indians.

4
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:34,000
The President
wantsa young Indian.

5
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:36,002
How young?

6
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:39,005
No. It's not like that.

7
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:44,408
Yeah 17 dozen, at least. Uhhuh...

8
00:00:44,744 --> 00:00:45,608
...on the... The 12th...

9
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:49,607
Mr. Ambassador,
The White House on line one.

10
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:55,021
Mr. President...

11
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:03,427
Get me young Indians.

12
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:24,050
Does India like George Bush?

13
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:26,050
I think he isa
very charming man!

14
00:01:26,152 --> 00:01:28,052
Lets just find out
from young India...

15
00:01:28,154 --> 00:01:29,451
...what they would like
to say to Mr. Bush.

16
00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:31,054
Give us some tips...

17
00:01:31,157 --> 00:01:33,785
...so that we can make our
country such a beautiful place.

18
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:36,460
Arre baba, we don't want him
to come because of who he is...

19
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:38,792
Who is he? Just coming like
that and all.

20
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:40,066
Well, I would say, like, no...

21
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:43,067
...at least for the nuclear thing...
like no...

22
00:01:43,169 --> 00:01:44,136
...he should go ahead with
India... Like no...

23
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,067
Give me H1 right away.

24
00:01:46,172 --> 00:01:47,070
Give me H1 visa.

25
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:55,081
Yes, the White House has asked
me to find one Young Indian.

26
00:01:55,181 --> 00:01:57,809
Capable of shaking hands
with President Bush.

27
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,813
It'sa huge responsibility!

28
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:03,817
I'm in the process of
shortlisting PR agencies...

29
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:06,092
...to find me a worthy young Indian.

30
00:02:06,192 --> 00:02:09,093
As you can see, we're you know,
we're written about...

31
00:02:09,195 --> 00:02:12,096
...in all kinds of different
magazinesall over the world.

32
00:02:12,198 --> 00:02:15,497
I've worked out this fabulous
television campaign.

33
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:40,854
Are you young, ambitious
and India's best?

34
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:42,856
Are you the future
of the new India?

35
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,858
Then President Bush wants you!

36
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:48,134
If you are under 30,
from any profession...

37
00:02:48,234 --> 00:02:49,201
...if you're the best!

38
00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:50,860
You won't get a bigger
chance in your life.

39
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:53,870
In citiesacross the nation,
from millions of people...

40
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:56,870
- we will choose...
- I will choose...

41
00:02:57,177 --> 00:03:00,146
6 candidates for
the greatest prize of all.

42
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:02,876
So India, get ready.

43
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:07,142
Because...
The President is coming!

44
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:15,889
I have nothingto say I
have nothingto say... Please!

45
00:03:32,612 --> 00:03:33,579
Get out!

46
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:56,930
Last seat remains.

47
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:58,602
Could it be you?

48
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,618
The initial body language
seemed quite positive.

49
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:17,212
The two leadersalmost had
a mini summit right there.

50
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:19,623
George! George!

51
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,227
Namaste!

52
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:32,638
Yes, today is the big day.

53
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:36,640
I feel like I've been asked
to choose the next Pope...

54
00:04:36,743 --> 00:04:37,971
...or the next Dalai Lama.

55
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,246
So... What exactly is your plan?

56
00:04:40,346 --> 00:04:41,313
Yeah!

57
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:45,248
The six finalistsand us will be
locked together in the consulate.

58
00:04:45,351 --> 00:04:48,980
See it's a fight to the finish.
Abattle... A war!

59
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,257
What she means is that
they will be competing.

60
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:54,991
Based on talent, personality,
knowledge of America.

61
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:56,262
Yeah, yeah, yeah... Yeah.

62
00:04:56,362 --> 00:04:58,262
There will be rounds,
like in boxing match.

63
00:04:58,364 --> 00:05:01,265
Andthe rounds willjust keep
getting tougher and tougher.

64
00:05:01,367 --> 00:05:03,665
And one by one the contestants
will get...

65
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:05,999
She doesn't mean, killed!

66
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:09,002
So that... So that when
President Bush...

67
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,004
...arrivesat the consulate
tomorrow morning...

68
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,279
...the best young Indian will
confidently stand...

69
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:15,006
...in front of him and say...

70
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,282
Hello!

71
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,683
How do you
intendto pick the winner?

72
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,289
We'll be doing it the
American way.

73
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:26,688
- You mean Democratic voting?
- RealityTV.

74
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:32,697
Survivor.
Big Boss. Best of both!

75
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,033
- Do you have permission?
- Permission?

76
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,307
To go inside.

77
00:05:48,414 --> 00:05:49,381
Why?

78
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:51,712
The Economic times says my dad
is India's th richest man.

79
00:05:51,818 --> 00:05:53,718
He's met like lots
of famous people.

80
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:59,314
But I've met like... No one.
This will be my first!

81
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:15,069
No, it's not like famous
people are someone else no?

82
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,740
They are people.

83
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:21,074
My broker says, if I make
it big in the stock market...

84
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,747
...bloody, people will forget
the other Kapil Dev.

85
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:35,088
I am not the one who is screaming
from a fucking mountain here...

86
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,761
...saying, you know,
Hey guys I'm Rohit Seth...

87
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:39,695
I've lived in
New York! I should win...

88
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:43,758
It's... Much more subtle
than that... Implied?

89
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:46,372
Excuse me.

90
00:06:46,472 --> 00:06:48,770
How important is this
handshake to you?

91
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:54,108
See, Pythagoras said that the
whole world is packed...

92
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:55,381
...in one thing.

93
00:06:55,481 --> 00:06:59,110
We spend our lives tryingto
find it. It could be handshake...

94
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:01,379
Yes... why not?

95
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:07,382
I like watchingAmerican TVon
Star Plusand Zee cafÃˆ.

96
00:07:07,493 --> 00:07:09,791
Also Maths. Two things.

97
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:12,796
Andalso girls.

98
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:14,400
I like that.

99
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:16,402
My family.

100
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:26,412
What do you think
your chances are?

101
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:28,810
See people say I
am very traditional.

102
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:32,816
Just because I wear Khadi, go to
templesand log on to Shaadi. Com.

103
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,421
They say, 'Ajay you are very
traditional'.

104
00:07:35,521 --> 00:07:37,148
And I tell them,
So what man...

105
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:40,153
So what Ravi?
He is my best friend.

106
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,429
I am traditional with an MBA
from IIM Ahmedabad!

107
00:07:43,529 --> 00:07:45,156
What's that?
That's not traditional.

108
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,433
I know lots of stuff
that is modern.

109
00:07:47,867 --> 00:07:49,835
I can say'Fuck'
andall that.

110
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,167
Are you excitedto shake
hands with President Bush?

111
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,840
I won't shake.
We're Indian!

112
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,848
We are now inside the consulate.

113
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,847
The six contestants
wait anxiously.

114
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:08,181
This ordinary basement
is now become a battleground.

115
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:09,853
The tension is mounting.

116
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:11,456
What do we have here?

117
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:17,463
Get your hand out of my way.

118
00:08:17,563 --> 00:08:19,463
Please notice the lovely
Bush statue.

119
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:24,868
Bush just left. You can still
hear the toilet flushing.

120
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:29,202
This is the door he left by,
it is still moving.

121
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:30,874
Hey Bhalla, come here!

122
00:08:30,977 --> 00:08:33,468
This is Rahul Bhalla,
first year MBAstudent?

123
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,482
You just shook his hand right?

124
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:37,883
No...

125
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,486
Bloody fool!

126
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:46,489
Um... Daddy is it okay for,
like, a strange man to touch me?

127
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:51,896
Yeah, he's in a uniform...
Ok. Go ahead.

128
00:08:56,936 --> 00:09:00,895
Mao Tse Tung, once said'Le Fu
Twin Whang Cha Ping'

129
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:04,510
Which means that, 'Inside every
thief is an honest man'

130
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:06,908
And Zenith Public Relations
is honest.

131
00:09:07,947 --> 00:09:10,916
Sam, you needto tell these
people what's going on...

132
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,246
President Bush is coming for
breakfast tomorrow morning...

133
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,521
...in this consulate.
Will you see him?

134
00:09:15,621 --> 00:09:18,522
- That's a question.
- Will you shake hands with him?

135
00:09:18,624 --> 00:09:19,921
That's another question.

136
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,256
As you know this isan all night
test so anything is possible.

137
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:24,530
All legal!

138
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:27,929
If you have anything to declare
from your past... Do it now.

139
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:32,868
Have you ever engaged in nudity,
sodomy, homosexuality?

140
00:09:32,972 --> 00:09:35,941
Have you ever been to a region
of dengue fever or plague?

141
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:37,942
Are you readingfrom a visa
application form?

142
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,547
No.

143
00:09:41,647 --> 00:09:45,276
Madam, I shower naked.
That is engaging in nudity?

144
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:48,952
Dude! Does the guard have
to grab my ass?

145
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:50,545
Of course, you may
be concealinga dagger.

146
00:09:50,656 --> 00:09:53,557
Arre, but this isan insult.
I am a social worker.

147
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:56,596
I am not Osama Bin Laden.
Myself, Ajay Karlekar.

148
00:09:56,631 --> 00:09:58,962
Please don't touch my breasts.

149
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,296
No, no. Who said Bengalis don't
like America?

150
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:04,968
They have a lot in common.

151
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:08,301
They are both nonvegetarians,
they are English speaking.

152
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:11,577
We even a U.S. Consulate
in Kolkotta.

153
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:23,579
So, they have a lot in common.

154
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,992
Okay, rearrange everyone,
make yourselvesat home.

155
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:30,994
You want us in any
particular order?

156
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,599
- By star signs.
- Ok I am Virgo.

157
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,605
Both are Virgos,
so should we sit on one chair?

158
00:10:39,705 --> 00:10:43,004
It wasa joke! She was joking.

159
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:46,009
What if President Bush
says somethingfunny?

160
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:49,615
- You must laugh.
- It's called humour.

161
00:10:49,715 --> 00:10:53,344
- I fucking knewthat.
- No bad words please.

162
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:56,622
Well, the President said
'That fucking Saddam'.

163
00:10:56,722 --> 00:10:59,020
Yes. It was on CNN.

164
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,627
Your current affairs
knowledge is good.

165
00:11:01,727 --> 00:11:04,025
- For what?
- Sorry Madam.

166
00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:09,023
I'm not into this humor.
I'm not.

167
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:13,972
Please, sit.

168
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:25,651
What is India shining? Eh?

169
00:11:25,751 --> 00:11:28,379
More people wearing jeans?
Bloody shit.

170
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:32,385
Do you know Amul?
The milk business... Amul.

171
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,057
It was started by farmers
in villages.

172
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,061
And now, it is the biggest milk
distribution system in the world.

173
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:39,665
You see, I want to start
something like that.

174
00:11:39,765 --> 00:11:44,065
Not milk, something else.
Maybe tea, coffee, orange squash.

175
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:47,070
And Bush isa farmer,
he will understandthat.

176
00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:49,664
In fact, he is thinking of
signinga Bill which will give...

177
00:11:49,775 --> 00:11:52,403
...one billion dollars in
aidto Indian farmers.

178
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:56,409
It isa beautiful thing no? I
will beg him to sign the Bill.

179
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,685
Fall and beg and hold his leg.

180
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:04,690
Please clap for Ritu because
she has been invited...

181
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:06,417
...for the breakfast with
the President...

182
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:09,695
...which I am not.
But I am really happy for her.

183
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,095
Show us the invitation.

184
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:25,700
I am Ritu Johnson, I am married
to an American man, John Johnson.

185
00:12:25,811 --> 00:12:27,711
That's why my last name
is Johnson.

186
00:12:27,813 --> 00:12:31,715
He isa visa officer here but...
... Don't ask me for a visa, okay?

187
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:38,053
Johnson is a popular last name
in America.

188
00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:39,715
If you ever go
there you will find out.

189
00:12:39,825 --> 00:12:43,454
Yes, It also means 'dick'
or'penis'.

190
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:46,129
Like... Like,
'he hasa 12 inch johnson'.

191
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:55,730
Just kidding, I mean,
I don't really know...

192
00:12:55,841 --> 00:12:56,808
Maybe.

193
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:00,473
Yes, yes.

194
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:04,480
I am liking the ladies, so
they are also reciprocating...

195
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:05,751
...some fondness.

196
00:13:05,851 --> 00:13:07,751
Especially because of
my moustache, I think.

197
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,749
I read magazines like
Cosmopolitan and such.

198
00:13:11,857 --> 00:13:14,758
It has tips!
Ten ways to be a great lover.

199
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:18,764
Ten best places to touch a girl!
I am reading.

200
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:22,165
It'sa step by step thing,
like a proof.

201
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:26,101
My arranged marriage value
will exponentially quadruple...

202
00:13:26,205 --> 00:13:28,173
...with me only as the
winning candidate.

203
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,504
They will bring out color
photo in 'The Hindu'.

204
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:34,780
Positive trend from handshake,
will lead in to marriage.

205
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,847
And then child.

206
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:39,179
- And till then?
- Till then?

207
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:40,786
Till then?

208
00:13:40,886 --> 00:13:44,788
I am looking for the sexy
time with the sexy lady.

209
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:47,520
Hi! I'm Archana Kapoor.

210
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:51,786
I went to, like
BU, Boston University...

211
00:13:51,897 --> 00:13:54,195
...for, like, an MBA...
but it was like totally cold...

212
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,790
...so I just said
What the hell...

213
00:13:55,901 --> 00:13:56,868
And I just came back.

214
00:13:56,969 --> 00:13:59,199
My Dadthinks I look
like Paris Hilton...

215
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,204
...but darker.

216
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:06,801
I mean, look at me, I am running
like a crore cosmetics empire...

217
00:14:06,912 --> 00:14:10,211
...which I started with like...
three crores.

218
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:14,820
Daddy says that this is like a
boom time for small businesses...

219
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:21,223
...in India. But I help transform
ugly women into, like, me!

220
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:25,228
So... I don't needa boom.

221
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,833
I just need... Ugly women.

222
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,234
Shall we toss
to see who goes next?

223
00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:32,827
Chill dude, this isn't cricket!

224
00:14:32,938 --> 00:14:37,568
Hey! No... Before anyone else
saysanything...

225
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:41,574
I just want to let everyone
know... Ijust want to confirm...

226
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,246
...that my name is Kapil Dev.

227
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:46,249
So if you want to make any jokes
na, please do it now.

228
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:52,255
As you can see, there is one BSE
index and there is Kapil index.

229
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:55,861
BSE index is going down and
Kapil index is going up.

230
00:14:55,961 --> 00:14:57,861
So BSE is 'bear' but Kapil is
'bull'.

231
00:14:58,497 --> 00:14:59,589
That is what I am trying
to say...

232
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,265
...that I am knowing more
than that BSE also. It is...

233
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:12,867
So in, ACC cement was trading
at its weeks low.

234
00:15:12,978 --> 00:15:13,945
So I said I should jump on it.

235
00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:17,277
No, no, no, no. Don't you know
any general knowledge?

236
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:18,884
Like what?

237
00:15:18,984 --> 00:15:20,884
Like what's the capital of the
United States, for example?

238
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:24,549
That's easy.
It is the DOW Jones.

239
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:27,620
That is where US keeps
capital, DowJones.

240
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:30,293
No no... Washington DC is the
capital.

241
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,898
The Dow Jones isa
stock exchange.

242
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:37,300
No, but that isa place...
You meant that capital?

243
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,905
I'm disqualified?
Madam, I thought paisa wala.

244
00:15:40,005 --> 00:15:40,972
That isalso capital, no?

245
00:15:41,073 --> 00:15:42,631
Sit down, sit down.
Ma'am, please.

246
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:45,638
I'm Maya Roy, I studied English
literature...

247
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,640
...at St. Stephen's college.

248
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:51,644
My first novel, 'Some yellow
mangoesand twelve broken dreams'

249
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:54,920
...was nominated for the
'Crossword Book Award' last year.

250
00:15:55,955 --> 00:16:00,324
It'sabout an Assamese tribal
midget community andtheir hopes...

251
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,919
I've read some American novels.
I like Hemmingway.

252
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:07,328
I think my novel is
like Hemmingway's...

253
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:12,336
But with a better beginning...
... And middle... And end.

254
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:13,939
'Bastards! '

255
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:18,933
Moga, the little man screamed.
It was Gandhi Jayanti...

256
00:16:19,044 --> 00:16:20,944
...andthe sky wept!

257
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,677
The field was littered with
handmade arrows.

258
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,952
Blood colored
grass stuck to his feet.

259
00:16:27,052 --> 00:16:29,350
If I ever have enough money I'd
like to go to Florida.

260
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,957
You know, to see
Hemmingway's house.

261
00:16:32,057 --> 00:16:34,355
Just to compare it with my own.

262
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:38,361
Currently I am starting a small
publishingfirm...

263
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:42,957
...with two of my friends, and we're
focusing on young poets.

264
00:16:43,068 --> 00:16:44,695
Young what? Young boys?

265
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:47,370
Poets... Poem writers?

266
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:49,975
Nice!

267
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:54,969
Oh and I'm divorced.
So it's 'Miss' not 'Mrs. Maya Roy'.

268
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,047
Thanks.

269
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:01,976
You can call me Rohit.
Or Tom, whatever... I use both.

270
00:17:02,087 --> 00:17:03,987
Like I said, I've lived
in America...

271
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:07,991
...and currently I am in India
and running India's top accent...

272
00:17:08,093 --> 00:17:10,721
...training academy. Speak Eazy...

273
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:15,000
We help train call centre
employees to remove their...

274
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:17,000
'native tongue interferences'.

275
00:17:17,102 --> 00:17:19,002
'Probably'

276
00:17:19,104 --> 00:17:21,732
'Pro'... 'Pro'...
'Bab'... 'Bab'...

277
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:25,010
'Ly'... 'Ly'...
'probably'... 'Probably'.

278
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,410
'Apparently'.

279
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:31,016
See the Indians have a long way
to go in learning how to be...

280
00:17:31,116 --> 00:17:32,083
American.

281
00:17:32,184 --> 00:17:35,745
That's true but,
why do Bengalis marry so much?

282
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,022
Sorry?

283
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:41,356
Madam! Kapil Dev made 175 runs
not out against Zimbabwe...

284
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:44,020
1983 in World Cup.
That is general knowledge.

285
00:17:44,129 --> 00:17:46,757
If Set Ais President has dogs
and Set B is...

286
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,431
I am thinking of buying a dog.

287
00:17:48,534 --> 00:17:51,025
Then Aintersection B is
'I am like Bush.

288
00:17:51,136 --> 00:17:52,103
Proved.

289
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,767
Can you please
repeat the question?

290
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,371
Hey, you can't even stay married.

291
00:17:56,475 --> 00:17:58,033
How dare you ask me
to repeat questions.

292
00:17:58,143 --> 00:17:59,770
Hey! Nigger please, man!

293
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,775
The President finds 'nigger'
an offensive term.

294
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:05,050
'Negro'.
You can say 'Negro'.

295
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:07,448
My Dad goes to America all the
time and he says 'Negro'.

296
00:18:07,553 --> 00:18:09,043
No, I don't think you can...

297
00:18:09,154 --> 00:18:11,782
I don't think you know my dad.
He can say what he wants.

298
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:14,059
My broker thinks I get nervous
around lunch time.

299
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:16,389
I think Nigger isa subset of
Negro.

300
00:18:16,495 --> 00:18:18,793
If Set Ais 'AII Niggers except
Negroes'and Set B is 'AII... '

301
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:21,794
My broker thinks I should do
self confidence course online.

302
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,466
I know all the words to
the National Anthem.

303
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:25,069
So do I... Jana Gana Mana...

304
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:28,073
No, no not that one.
The American National Anthem.

305
00:18:28,173 --> 00:18:30,801
The 'Star Spangled Banner'.
You know why?

306
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,475
Because you lived in America?

307
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,080
Yes, but don't get smart
with me lady...

308
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:37,080
...I fire women
like you all the time.

309
00:18:37,182 --> 00:18:41,810
They think they know America.
But the accent... it is shit!

310
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:44,487
Arre, it is because she
is divorced no? It happens.

311
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:47,490
Women have to become wise
when they become divorced...

312
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:50,823
...to make up for the handicap.
It's like that same logic.

313
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,826
You see, when you become blind,
hearing sensation will go up.

314
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:57,102
But madams, how do they let
in such low class people in...

315
00:18:57,202 --> 00:18:58,829
'India's best list'?

316
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,503
First they will allow divorced
women...

317
00:19:00,606 --> 00:19:04,098
...then they will allow Non Hindus.
Where does thisall end?

318
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:24,129
Dude...
you're crazy, man!

319
00:19:24,229 --> 00:19:25,196
Thank you.

320
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:29,134
No, not in a good way.
In a way of a racist!

321
00:19:29,234 --> 00:19:31,134
Anarrow minded chauvinist...

322
00:19:31,236 --> 00:19:34,137
...who hates people from
different cultural backgrounds.

323
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:38,143
But... That is just like Bush.

324
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:42,147
You don't know him, man...
You even been to the White House?

325
00:19:42,247 --> 00:19:43,874
See I took the city tour.

326
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:48,142
City tour? You don't even know
anythingabout...

327
00:19:48,253 --> 00:19:49,880
...this great country
that we are living in.

328
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:53,158
I know that in this 'Great'
country that we are living in...

329
00:19:53,258 --> 00:19:55,556
...people like you,
they start riots, man.

330
00:19:56,195 --> 00:20:00,154
And... Those two girls
there... They know that.

331
00:20:00,265 --> 00:20:01,892
And who are they to judge me?

332
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:05,568
They're the judges man.

333
00:20:07,806 --> 00:20:10,900
Look the judges, selectors,
whatever...

334
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,178
...they know that
I am their only candidate...

335
00:20:13,278 --> 00:20:15,178
...that can have a real
conversation with the president.

336
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,578
Not just standthere like some
foolish guy.

337
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:20,913
You know I've been there.
I'm practically one of them.

338
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,187
Not like these Indians!

339
00:20:22,287 --> 00:20:24,915
With their mummy daddy
inheritance and old money...

340
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,192
...livingat home with

00:20:39,638 --> 00:20:43,199
Well I mean... Yes, it sucks that
they found out I was illegal...

00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:18,241

369
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:51,342
Yes, yes.

00:21:51,443 --> 00:21:53,274
Mandela! Mandela! Mandela!

371
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:56,679
That's not Mandela.

372
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:03,686
Daddy, really quickly.

373
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:06,290

No... They're not in
Bombay. I already asked that!

376
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:14,697
Look, just forget it!

377
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:16,699
AIQaida, Madam.

378
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:20,305
Archana madam.

379
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:36,321
The horses that
lead us in, added...

380
00:22:36,421 --> 00:22:39,322
...great elegance to
this welcoming ceremony.

381
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:55,340
Madam!

382
00:22:58,777 --> 00:23:00,335
- Yes?
- So...

383
00:23:03,782 --> 00:23:06,342
- Your husband is not rich?
- What?

384
00:23:06,451 --> 00:23:11,753
No like... You know... what is
your arrangement with Aunty Sam?

385
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:14,086
You get a salary or
commission for doing this?

386
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:16,361
Or you know... How you work?

387
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:17,760
I...

388
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:19,363
You got a nice dress
for the banquet?

389
00:23:19,464 --> 00:23:22,092
You know with the Bush,
nice, tip top...

390
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:23,766
If you... You know, we can...

391
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:25,359
- Excuse me.
- I... I could...

392
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:28,373
Kapil.

393
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:35,380
Yes. Hello... Girl.

394
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,447
No, no...

395
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:48,393
Make it quick.

396
00:23:58,437 --> 00:23:59,404
I mean. It's not like...

397
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:06,411
Did you come by mistake?

398
00:24:06,511 --> 00:24:07,808
Hey, listen person!

399
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:10,415
If you think I am going to
bribe Bush so that...

400
00:24:10,515 --> 00:24:12,813
...he can bribe the World Bank
into creating a panic...

401
00:24:12,918 --> 00:24:14,818
...in the Indian stock market so
that I can buy Tata Steel...

402
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,410
...at half price... I'm not!

403
00:24:16,521 --> 00:24:18,421
- What? - And if you think
so you're wrong, okay?

404
00:24:18,523 --> 00:24:21,822
And please,
I have a girlfriend, now.

405
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:25,430
In a day or two I'll tell her
she's my girlfriend...

406
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:27,430
...andthen you'll be fucked!

407
00:24:27,532 --> 00:24:30,160
When we do our honeymoon
shopping, no?

408
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:32,437
...you'll be selling your lipstick
outside those Shopper's Stops!

409
00:24:32,537 --> 00:24:33,834
Yeah right!

410
00:24:33,939 --> 00:24:35,429
You don't even look like her ass!

411
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:36,507
Asshole!

412
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:38,439
Hey... I've been to a disco,
okay... With my Mummy.

413
00:24:38,543 --> 00:24:41,842
Hilton! 5 star! Hey, bitchgirl
you're one Bloody, girlbitch!

414
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:43,448
Hello Madam.

415
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:47,452
You know, I can
judge people really well.

416
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:49,454
Honestly.

417
00:24:49,554 --> 00:24:51,852
You know, once I was sitting
in this star bathroom...

418
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:53,856
...maybe Hilton, Hyatt...
one of those.

419
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:57,189
And I was readingthis little
article on HDFC stock.

420
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:58,861
This little, this small.

421
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:02,865
And I invested.
And look at me today.

422
00:25:02,968 --> 00:25:05,459
I am one of India's topmarket traders...

423
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:06,867
...and I have my own Honda Accord.

424
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:11,875
Now please... Today is
Saturday night. So, party night.

425
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:17,482
Sam! That man Kapil.

426
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:29,483
I think he offered me a bribe!

427
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:36,501
- How much?
- I didn't take it!

428
00:25:37,936 --> 00:25:38,903
Take it.

429
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:41,904
See, the proof of the
pudding... is in the pudding!

430
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:44,907
- We needto expose.
- What?

431
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:47,512
Him! We needto expose him!

432
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:49,912
Sam! We can't mess this up!

433
00:25:50,015 --> 00:25:52,506
You know how much I've beggedthe
Ambassador to give us this job?

434
00:25:52,617 --> 00:25:54,915
- You think I don't know that?
- I'm not saying that...

435
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:57,511
No, no, no, no! You think I
like goingto war all the time?

436
00:25:57,622 --> 00:26:01,922
You know, Samantha is so strong
and confident and... Strong.

437
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:07,259
Sometimes I go over to her house
when my husband's working late...

438
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:10,535
...or even when he's not.
And she tells me things.

439
00:26:10,969 --> 00:26:13,529
And I listen... To it.

440
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:18,532
Samantha says I know nothing...
But she's joking, of course.

441
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:22,547
Idiot!

442
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:29,554
Not now, please...

443
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:33,550
Yeah, see, in this next round...

444
00:26:33,658 --> 00:26:35,558
I'm goingto put them in
physically challenging states.

445
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:38,959
So, they'll be acting like
animals or dancing...

446
00:26:39,064 --> 00:26:41,555
...or stressing out. And then
I'll throwthem a Bush challenge.

447
00:26:41,666 --> 00:26:44,567
Quote a famous Bush speech!

448
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:48,573
Can you really do that
while imitatinga frog?

449
00:26:58,617 --> 00:26:59,584
Freeze!

450
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:01,984
Maya! Ramesh! Archana!

451
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:04,984
Our enemiesare innovative
and resourceful So are we!

452
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:07,319
They never stop thinking of
ways of harming our country...

453
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:08,593
...and our people.
and neither do we!

454
00:27:08,693 --> 00:27:11,594
I just want you to know
that when we talk about war...

455
00:27:11,696 --> 00:27:13,323
...we are actually talking
about peace.

456
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:15,998
People say, 'How can I help
in this war against terror?

457
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:17,602
'How can I fight evil? '

458
00:27:17,702 --> 00:27:19,602
You can do so by mentoring
a child.

459
00:27:19,704 --> 00:27:24,334
By going into a small boy'shouse
and saying 'I love you'.

460
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:28,602
Excellent! Excellent!
Everyone! Okay. Now... Dance!

461
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,618
Look, this is the toughestcompetition...

462
00:27:33,718 --> 00:27:34,685
...in the history of India.

463
00:27:34,786 --> 00:27:36,617
So we definitely need
a physical round.

464
00:27:36,721 --> 00:27:39,019
I mean, how else will they
know if you're physically fit?

465
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:41,626
What if you faint when
you meet him?

466
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:45,357
Freeze! Kapil?

467
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:46,631
I have
investments in oil companies.

468
00:27:46,731 --> 00:27:48,358
Hey! Bush never said that man!

469
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:49,634
Hey! Fuck you man!
Just be in your state!

470
00:27:49,734 --> 00:27:50,701
You fuck yourself!
Be in your state!

471
00:27:50,802 --> 00:27:53,032
Shhh... No fighting
as yourselves. Only as Bush!

472
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:55,640
Now! Busy state everyone!

473
00:27:59,077 --> 00:28:00,635
Freeze! Maya! Kapil!

474
00:28:00,745 --> 00:28:02,042
Singapore is the
capital of Asia.

475
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:04,046
I have investment
in oil companies...

476
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:06,048
Okay, state four everyone!

477
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:09,381
Hey, but Ritu madam?
What is state four?

478
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:11,656
Agitated you racist... Like this!

479
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:13,658
Freeze!

480
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:16,659
Ajay, Ramesh,
Rohit, Archana, Maya!

481
00:28:17,095 --> 00:28:18,995
I want to go to Greece
and meet the Grecians.

482
00:28:19,097 --> 00:28:20,394
I know what I believe.

483
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:21,666
I will continue to believe what
I believe.

484
00:28:21,766 --> 00:28:23,666
I believe what
I believe is right!

485
00:28:23,768 --> 00:28:26,396
Some of our imports
come from abroad.

486
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:28,673
The main thingAmerican parents
needto ask themselves is...

487
00:28:28,773 --> 00:28:30,673
...is our children learning?

488
00:28:30,775 --> 00:28:32,675
I promise I will listen to
everything that has been said...

489
00:28:32,777 --> 00:28:34,677
...in this room. Even though
I wasn't in this room.

490
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:37,409
I have investment in
oil companies...

491
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:38,683
Kapil, shut up!

492
00:28:38,783 --> 00:28:41,081
Okay, state... Go nuts everyone!

493
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:53,691
Yes, Maya looks sexy when she is
agitated. I can say it. So?

494
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:57,702
Listen.

495
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:00,705
You! You shouldn't
have pushed me, okay!

496
00:29:00,805 --> 00:29:03,103
Yeah? I'll push you again!

497
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:10,715
Guard! Guard!

498
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:17,119
Be careful! Be careful!
He'sa trainedassassin!

499
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:19,724
No, that's not true.

500
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:22,717
When the guard pulled
out his gun...

501
00:29:22,827 --> 00:29:24,727
...I thought, Ã¬Wow! Ã®

502
00:29:25,163 --> 00:29:28,132
Yes said Wow also.
There's a real gun!

503
00:29:31,169 --> 00:29:32,136
Wow.

504
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:01,163
Very successful trip.

505
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:15,507
He's saying it's lost in repair.

506
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:17,782
Does he understandthat this is
the 'President's' father?

507
00:30:17,882 --> 00:30:19,782
The 'President' who is coming?

508
00:30:19,884 --> 00:30:22,785
Does he understand the
importance of the situation?

509
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:33,195
He's saying it's an okay
photo of Dharmandra.

510
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:35,197
It is okay to let it be.

511
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:38,803
This is Code Orange.

512
00:30:38,903 --> 00:30:41,201
I need someone to Google
a photo of old man Bush.

513
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,809
Sam? I got you these,
for good luck.

514
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:48,210
- Pastries.
- Calories.

515
00:30:50,248 --> 00:30:51,215
Sam?

516
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:07,832
I'm working on
four novels myself.

517
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:11,563
One isa trilogy about death.

518
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:15,829
Andthe other isa tragicomedy,
so I like to call it a tragedy.

519
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:17,842
Good.

520
00:31:20,278 --> 00:31:24,840
'Into that kingdom of heaven,
my father, let my country awake.

521
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:30,253
The one and only Rabindranath
Tagore... Bengali, na?

522
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:33,858
I think it's 'Into that heaven
of freedom, my father...

523
00:31:33,958 --> 00:31:36,256
...let my country awake'.
Not kingdom.

524
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:42,867
I hate these elite people.

525
00:31:42,967 --> 00:31:46,266
These 'English speaking'
so called people.

526
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:48,873
And let me tell you... I
learned English...

527
00:31:48,973 --> 00:31:52,602
...only to compete with them.
Otherwise I hate that language.

528
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:55,277
Even though I am such good
speaker in it, I hate it.

529
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:59,873
Do they knowthis? No they don't
even know that I am self taught...

530
00:31:59,984 --> 00:32:02,885
...in Bengali, Marathi, Punjabi,
Bengali, Gujrati, Hindi, Tamil.

531
00:32:02,987 --> 00:32:04,614
No, we didn't discuss it.

532
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:07,619
While they were busy in
call centers...

533
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:09,894
...picking up fake
accents or in discos...

534
00:32:09,994 --> 00:32:13,623
I was there, listening to
tapes called...

535
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:14,899
Learn Oriya in thirty days.

536
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:17,301
Audio cassettes. Not even CDs!

537
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:38,320
Hey Lipstick,
I've seen you somewhere.

538
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:40,584
The name is Archana.

539
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:42,927
And you must have seen me at a
fashion show or something.

540
00:32:43,027 --> 00:32:43,994
No...

541
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:46,931
Are you a slut?

542
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:49,934
- Huh?
- Yeah, like a whore type?

543
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:51,936
No!

544
00:32:57,375 --> 00:33:01,334
Hey bastard! I've seen you
also somewhere also.

545
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,948
You are the trader
from Kotak, right?

546
00:33:04,048 --> 00:33:07,347
No man... 'Speak Eazy'

547
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:14,357
Hey dude. Listen, Ijust wanted
to say I am sorry okay?

548
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:17,359
Just wanted to apologize.
Come on.

549
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:20,965
Ha ha!...
I don't think so man!

550
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:26,368
Yeah! Wassup!

551
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:29,974
Now tell me again about
the neck man. So...

552
00:33:30,074 --> 00:33:31,974
Basically, you have to
pull it like this...

553
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:16,419
You have lovely fingers
... On your hands.

554
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:18,022
Thanks.

555
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:23,426
I am called Ramesh S...
'S' is private.

556
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:29,431
- What's up, Florida?
- Sorry?

557
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:33,037
You know, you said earlier,
you wanted to go to Florida...

558
00:34:33,137 --> 00:34:35,435
...to see some house.
I'm saying, I have been there.

559
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:38,042
Oh did you go to
Hemmingway's house?

560
00:34:38,142 --> 00:34:41,771
- No. Is he famous?
- Yes.

561
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:48,041
- Ball player?
- Novelist... He wrote novels.

562
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:53,046
- You are being divorced?
- Yes, I am. Divorced.

563
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:56,055
Husbandsare bastard people!

564
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:58,790
If you saw Desperate Housewives,
you will see that...

565
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:01,065
...husbands beat wife
and wife leaves home.

566
00:35:01,165 --> 00:35:05,465
Yes, well, I am busy,
24x7, 365. So...

567
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:11,474
Busy... Busy...
lady... Samantha...

568
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:19,482
Sam... Fox... Foxy...
Dirty Lady?

569
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:26,488
Florida hasa great nightclub
scene. Are you into house?

570
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:29,093
Yes I have an apartment
in Jodhpur Park.

571
00:35:29,193 --> 00:35:33,493
No.
'House' is a kind of music.

572
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:35,099
No, I don't know it.

573
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:37,497
My range is limited. I only
listen to Hindustani Classical.

574
00:35:37,602 --> 00:35:40,503
Ewww! I hate that shit!

575
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:43,505
You know, It's like someone's
murdering a cat or something.

576
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:46,508
Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni Saa...

577
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:48,112
You know?

578
00:35:58,756 --> 00:36:00,121
Are you a lesbian?

579
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:07,120
- You are having the child?
- No, I live alone.

580
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:10,532
That's sad, but helpful.

581
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:14,138
Because, you know... if I could
stay back in Bombay...

582
00:36:14,238 --> 00:36:16,138
...if I could not go
back to Bangalore...

583
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:20,142
...if you couldarrange
the meeting with Bush...

584
00:36:20,244 --> 00:36:23,543
...if you couldarrange for
me being selected...

585
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:28,141
...then, you could come in my
car and we could do some...

586
00:36:28,252 --> 00:36:30,880
...you know...
'late night HBO' type of fun...

587
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:35,558
And I could buy you a
chicken lollipop.

588
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:39,561
I am vegetarian.

589
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:47,501
No it's wrong, it's completely
wrongthe flag...

590
00:36:47,605 --> 00:36:48,572
...has to be on that side.

591
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:52,904
And all of you come on this side!

592
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:13,257
Madam... I'm not Madonna.

593
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,996
What is this Mr. Ramesh?
Please! Out!

594
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:26,668
This is not American!

595
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:57,301
- Hi.
- Hi.

596
00:38:58,336 --> 00:39:00,031
I wantedto ask you something.

597
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:06,310
Why?

598
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:11,315
You want to ride on
my love machine, eh?

599
00:39:11,749 --> 00:39:12,716
No, no.

600
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:16,320
Why are you always
tryingto seduce women?

601
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:19,323
Aren't you gay?

602
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,328
I don't know what you're saying.

603
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:29,060
You are Ramesh Shrinivas, right?

604
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:33,326
You joined Microsoft six years
ago, right after IIT?

605
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:38,331
Hari your boyfriend...
I know him through my NGO work.

606
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:43,347
How you are knowing?

607
00:39:44,782 --> 00:39:46,340
It is my personal life.

608
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:48,750
Are you a spy?

609
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:56,360
Besides, Hari is my friend.

610
00:39:56,794 --> 00:39:59,354
It's not like that gay and
all like the people say, okay?

611
00:39:59,463 --> 00:40:00,430
Just friends!

612
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:08,770
Yes, Hari and I,
we may shower together.

613
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:11,773
But what is that?
Lack of space only, no?

614
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,105
I don't want the US to know this.

615
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:17,108
How can I then get employment
with Microsoft in Seattle and...

616
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:18,382
...become the next CEO
after Bill Gates?

617
00:40:18,482 --> 00:40:21,110
I want the US to know
that I am likingthe girls.

618
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:25,116
After marriage we will all
be happy... Wife, Hari and me!

619
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:27,118
Madam, God promise... I am
requesting some silence...

620
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:28,392
...on this issue.

621
00:40:28,492 --> 00:40:30,790
Yeah, yeah of course.
Listen don't worry. Don't worry...

622
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:34,796
- I am not going to tell.
- I am likingthe girls.

623
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:03,427
- Sorry!
- It's unisex...

624
00:41:03,527 --> 00:41:04,494
Oh!

625
00:41:10,868 --> 00:41:15,828
Bastard! Now I know where
I know you from. Eh! See!

626
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:23,175
- Look it's him! It's you man!
- That's not me, man.

627
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:24,448
You're smiling!

628
00:41:24,548 --> 00:41:27,176
It'sa big one eh? Like Tata!

629
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:29,453
Is this a boy or a girl?

630
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:32,456
I'm just asking.

631
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:35,186
I have seen this earlier.
It is quite famous.

632
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:36,460
Arre, no bastard!

633
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:37,458
I have the whole thing you see
the girl and all... It will come.

634
00:41:37,561 --> 00:41:39,461
Listen guys,
I think we should just...

635
00:41:39,563 --> 00:41:41,190
Hey you think you are
one stud or what?

636
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:44,866
Hey look at him he's going
all 'Chaka chak'! Solid!

637
00:41:44,969 --> 00:41:45,936
Good job yeah.

638
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:48,198
Hey! Bloody! He's doing

639
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:50,474
Hey! Come on! Hey!
Come on, Come on!

640
00:41:50,574 --> 00:41:53,873
Too good man! How?
Who's the girl, who's the girl?

641
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:57,481
Lipstick?

642
00:41:58,516 --> 00:41:59,483
Lip...

643
00:42:03,921 --> 00:42:05,889
Madam you really
look like Paris Hilton!

644
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:09,493
You're still such
a bastard Rohit!

645
00:42:09,593 --> 00:42:12,494
- Archana! Arch!
- Savita Bhabi.

646
00:42:12,596 --> 00:42:14,894
You guys. You guys
are such bastards, man!

647
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:23,905
Please... Uh... Rewind, no?

648
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:30,506
- It's her.
- Definitely.

649
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:39,523
Is Bush an angel?

650
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:56,540
In other news, build
your own Bush.

651
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,540
Aman from
Nagpur shows you how.

652
00:43:05,983 --> 00:43:06,950
Useless idiot!

653
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:09,553
Idiot!

654
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:35,579
Mohammed Aslam.

655
00:43:53,697 --> 00:43:54,664
Shahrukh Khan?

656
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:58,602
- Archana! - Rohit please, I
don't want to talk to you, okay.

657
00:43:58,702 --> 00:44:00,329
This can't go on forever right?

658
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:02,333
Like yes! it can!

659
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:03,607
Just lower your voice...

660
00:44:03,707 --> 00:44:07,609
Once I shake
George Bush's hand...

661
00:44:07,711 --> 00:44:10,612
...then all those page
people, who said, like...

662
00:44:10,714 --> 00:44:13,012
There's Archana, the slut!

663
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:18,611
Will say... There's Archana,
the President's friend!

664
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:23,627
That will be like a slap
in their face... Like that!

665
00:44:23,727 --> 00:44:25,024
I don't want to talk
to you Rohit!

666
00:44:25,129 --> 00:44:26,221
Just leave me alone!

667
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:28,025
Somebody stole my
phone, Archana...

668
00:44:29,066 --> 00:44:30,624
I didn't do it.

669
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:33,364
I have never met
Archana's dad, okay?

670
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:36,037
I mean some of his
associates came to see me.

671
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,637
But they couldn't touch me.

672
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:50,051
Anyway, everything is not about
Archana. Alright? I just...

673
00:44:51,689 --> 00:44:53,384
I needto get out of this
country, you know.

674
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:55,386
Go to The States for a while.

675
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:59,655
You know, when I shake George's
hand, I'll let him know.

676
00:44:59,763 --> 00:45:01,390
I will explain him everything...

677
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:03,667
And then we will know who will
have the last laugh...

678
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:07,671
Me... I'll have the last laugh.

679
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:10,641
So, Mohammed Aslam...

680
00:45:44,808 --> 00:45:47,709
Just a minute!
Madam... Can you wait please?

681
00:45:47,811 --> 00:45:50,109
- No! - I am requesting you,
I need your help.

682
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:54,115
I am sorry for what I said
earlier, I'm a little hot headed.

683
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:59,121
This man here, Mohammed Aslam...
He writes poems in Urdu.

684
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:04,125
- Printing.
- Yes, yes.

685
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:06,127
It is for him, not for me.

686
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:18,469
The goal of this next round is
that each of you...

687
00:46:18,776 --> 00:46:20,744
...will be given a status.
Andtoldto enact a scene.

688
00:46:20,844 --> 00:46:23,745
We want to make sure that
you who have...

689
00:46:23,847 --> 00:46:25,474
...a lower status than
the President of America...

690
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:27,751
...maintain that statusand don't
try to become...

691
00:46:27,851 --> 00:46:30,149
- The President of America.
- Yes.

692
00:46:30,788 --> 00:46:34,747
So the situation is that
three of you are roommates...

693
00:46:34,858 --> 00:46:39,158
...andthat one of you has
been stealing money. Okay?

694
00:46:39,797 --> 00:46:42,766
So Rohit, you have
the middle statusand...

695
00:46:43,267 --> 00:46:45,167
Maya, you have the
highest status.

696
00:46:45,803 --> 00:46:47,771
And Ritu... You have
the lowest status.

697
00:46:48,806 --> 00:46:50,774
- Why?
- Just be yourself!

698
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:52,776
- Madam...
- Yes?

699
00:46:52,876 --> 00:46:54,503
Is there like a script?
Or we can say what we want?

700
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:57,781
No no no... it's called,
'Improv' it comes from the word...

701
00:46:57,881 --> 00:47:02,181
- 'Impromptu'.
- No, improvisation.

702
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:06,779
Exactly! Uh, right Maya,
you can come in later.

703
00:47:08,826 --> 00:47:09,793
Right... Um... Go!

704
00:47:09,893 --> 00:47:10,860
Thieves!

705
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:16,800
- Like... where's my cash?
- I promise, I didn't take it.

706
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:19,198
I know you did, you cheap bitch!

707
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:23,807
- No, I'm not a thief.
- Show me your money!

708
00:47:23,907 --> 00:47:26,808
- It's in the bank.
- I want to go to that bank now.

709
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:28,812
Please believe me...

710
00:47:28,912 --> 00:47:32,814
You are nothing, you understand?
You are a piece of useless shit.

711
00:47:32,916 --> 00:47:34,213
Absolutely nothing!

712
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:37,218
Okay, Maya, you can come in now.

713
00:47:39,857 --> 00:47:41,825
Where is my money, you dog?

714
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:44,225
You don't understand English?

715
00:47:44,361 --> 00:47:46,829
- Maya, what are you doing?
- You go and get me some tea!

716
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:49,560
I... I don't have it.

717
00:47:49,867 --> 00:47:50,834
Yeah?

718
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:53,564
Fuck! Ejeez man!

719
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:55,839
Excellent! Excellent!

720
00:47:56,874 --> 00:47:58,239
- I think she broke my nose.
- Oh Sorry.

721
00:47:58,375 --> 00:48:01,242
- Don't touch me!
- Just, go get some ice.

722
00:48:01,879 --> 00:48:02,846
Madam...

723
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:05,578
I mean, you are so quiet,
then all of a sudden...

724
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:08,852
Madam, if you were a
stock I would buy you.

725
00:48:08,952 --> 00:48:10,579
You know, this is ridiculous!

726
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:12,856
I would have hit her back,
but she's a woman!

727
00:48:12,956 --> 00:48:14,856
Sit down Rohit
I wasacting!

728
00:48:14,958 --> 00:48:16,858
Sit down everyone, settle down.

729
00:48:17,895 --> 00:48:18,862
Show me.

730
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:23,594
Okay, Ajay? Ajay, you're a
Government servant.

731
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:25,869
And you are
interviewingtwo people...

732
00:48:25,969 --> 00:48:27,869
...for the job of a
Government Press Officer.

733
00:48:27,971 --> 00:48:29,871
Ok Mr. Ajay, they both
have the equal status...

734
00:48:29,973 --> 00:48:31,600
...but you decide duringthe
interview...

735
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:34,878
- who has the higher status.
- That is very easy actually.

736
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:39,610
No, no, no, no...
you cant ask them that.

737
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:40,884
Why?

738
00:48:40,984 --> 00:48:42,884
Because they have equal status
when you began the interview.

739
00:48:42,986 --> 00:48:44,613
- They can not have equal status!
- Why?

740
00:48:44,922 --> 00:48:47,891
They have to belongto some
caste! Brahmin or whatever...

741
00:48:47,991 --> 00:48:49,891
No, no... No... No. We won't talk
of the caste differences here.

742
00:48:49,993 --> 00:48:51,893
The President doesn't
want to hear it.

743
00:48:51,995 --> 00:48:53,223
But Madam, I know...

744
00:48:53,330 --> 00:48:55,230
...in rural India if you have to
be a Press Officer...

745
00:48:55,332 --> 00:48:56,629
...you have to be a schedule caste.

746
00:48:56,934 --> 00:48:59,300
Which is lower status, but higher
chance of getting the job.

747
00:48:59,536 --> 00:49:01,629
- Reservations, no?
- This isacting.

748
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:03,907
This is lie madam, I won't do it.

749
00:49:18,956 --> 00:49:20,651
I don't want to fight.
I am smoking.

750
00:49:21,959 --> 00:49:25,326
I liked how you didn't break
your principles to role play.

751
00:49:26,964 --> 00:49:28,932
Yes. That is there.

752
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:32,936
Can I say something?

753
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:38,670
- Yes. - You know, I hate
your Salman Rushdie.

754
00:49:38,976 --> 00:49:40,944
Always writing some or the
other book over there.

755
00:49:41,979 --> 00:49:42,946
That's there...

756
00:49:46,984 --> 00:49:48,417
- You have a dog?
- Yes.

757
00:49:48,585 --> 00:49:52,612
Good, I like dogs.
They can't speak English, bloody!

758
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:54,958
But can communicate
anywhere in the world.

759
00:49:56,994 --> 00:49:57,961
Lovely, no?

760
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:04,957
Mine is calledJoseph Stalin. But
the fucker isalways terrified.

761
00:50:08,005 --> 00:50:08,972
Where are you taking me?

762
00:50:09,072 --> 00:50:11,973
So... You find me sexy
when I get agitated?

763
00:50:14,011 --> 00:50:15,979
I'm sorry, but...
Please don't complain.

764
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:18,980
Sssh!
It's okay... I don't mind.

765
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:21,985
Touch me.

766
00:50:24,021 --> 00:50:24,988
Nice!

767
00:50:35,032 --> 00:50:35,999
Ritu.

768
00:50:39,036 --> 00:50:45,407
Busy... Busy... Lady...
Assistant...

769
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:48,011
Ass!

770
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:52,015
Meow!

771
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:55,018
Excuse me!

772
00:50:58,055 --> 00:50:59,420
- It'sa sweet dish...
- Rice?

773
00:50:59,523 --> 00:51:02,014
- Coconut and kheer...
- Indian culture very similar.

774
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:04,027
But tasty.

775
00:51:04,127 --> 00:51:08,427
- You needto improve!
- Come! Ready!

776
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:19,441
Atalent is what
makes you... Talented.

777
00:51:21,078 --> 00:51:24,707
Do you have talent?
What makes you so special?

778
00:51:25,082 --> 00:51:28,051
Why should President Bush
give you five minutes?

779
00:51:28,151 --> 00:51:30,051
And not the other five billion...

780
00:51:30,153 --> 00:51:32,781
...nine hundredand ninety nine
million people?

781
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:36,059
Madam... if President Bush shook
everyone's hand...

782
00:51:36,159 --> 00:51:38,389
...then he would need
a hundred million years.

783
00:51:38,495 --> 00:51:40,463
And he is President only
for five years.

784
00:51:41,098 --> 00:51:44,067
And say even if he is
President for infinity...

785
00:51:44,167 --> 00:51:46,067
...it is not a good use
of possible resources.

786
00:51:46,169 --> 00:51:49,070
Because A - In the US they would
have to give up voting...

787
00:51:49,172 --> 00:51:51,800
...and make President Bush
President for the longest time...

788
00:51:52,109 --> 00:51:55,806
...longer than the history of earth.
BThere will be a very long line.

789
00:51:56,113 --> 00:51:57,808
C His hands will hurt.

790
00:51:58,115 --> 00:52:01,084
This is calledTautology a field
of deduction in mathematics.

791
00:52:01,184 --> 00:52:03,084
- Now I would like to dance.
- Please.

792
00:52:16,133 --> 00:52:20,092
Not here, there, up in the sky.

793
00:52:21,471 --> 00:52:26,101
Come with me, I want to fly.

794
00:52:27,144 --> 00:52:30,113
Don't stop let the
whole world know.

795
00:52:30,213 --> 00:52:32,841
Don't stop!
Let the whole world know!

796
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:37,849
Come fast... Come fast...
Come fast...

797
00:52:38,155 --> 00:52:40,123
Don't be slow.

798
00:52:40,223 --> 00:52:42,521
I don't know what you say.

799
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:44,855
I don't know, don't
know what you say.

800
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:48,131
But I want to dance and play.

801
00:52:48,231 --> 00:52:54,136
I want to play the game of love.
I want you in the name of love.

802
00:52:55,172 --> 00:52:59,131
Mr. Ramesh.
Mr. Ramesh S! Thank you!

803
00:53:00,177 --> 00:53:01,804
What was that?

804
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:04,147
Great South Indian star,
Kamal Hassan, Madam.

805
00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:08,549
He is like the
Al Pacino of Chennai.

806
00:53:09,186 --> 00:53:13,145
This famous song is from his
film Ek Duje Ke Liye. Thank you.

807
00:53:17,194 --> 00:53:19,560
I would prefer it if
no one else dances.

808
00:53:20,197 --> 00:53:22,563
I would now like to recite
a passage from Hamlet.

809
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:24,565
Yes, please, go ahead.

810
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:36,907
What a piece of work isa man,
how noble in reason...

811
00:53:37,214 --> 00:53:39,182
...how infinite in faculties.

812
00:53:39,616 --> 00:53:41,914
In action how like an angel.

813
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:45,188
In apprehension how like a God!

814
00:53:45,288 --> 00:53:51,193
And Yet, to me, what is this
quintessence of dusts?

815
00:53:54,231 --> 00:53:56,199
Man delights, not me.

816
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:05,208
Bravo! Bravo!

817
00:54:07,244 --> 00:54:08,211
Madam!

818
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:11,214
I can move one eyebrow without
moving the other.

819
00:54:11,314 --> 00:54:12,941
How lovely! Show us.

820
00:54:15,252 --> 00:54:18,221

both eyebrows.

821
00:54:19,256 --> 00:54:21,952
- What happened? Who says?
- Dude... We can see!

822
00:54:22,259 --> 00:54:24,227
Can't you do anything else, huh?
May be with finance.

00:55:12,375 --> 00:55:14,673
I don't have any talents.

843
00:55:15,312 --> 00:55:17,678
Madam, you have talent.

844
00:55:18,315 --> 00:55:19,282
Shut up!

00:55:44,341 --> 00:55:45,308
Slut.

857
00:55:47,344 --> 00:55:48,311
Gigolo?

858
00:55:48,411 --> 00:55:50,311
Girl... Uh...

859
00:55:51,748 --> 00:55:52,715
American...

860
00:55:54,351 --> 00:55:55,318
...Beauty?

861
00:55:57,354 --> 00:55:58,321
American...

862
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:09,332
Okay, Mr. Ajay,
what will you do for us?

863
00:56:09,432 --> 00:56:13,061
I will tell some jokes.
Here is the first one, Okay?

864
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:19,331
You know, Helen Keller?
The blind one, the blind woman.

865
00:56:19,442 --> 00:56:22,343
Why wouldn't Helen Keller
ever drive a car?

866
00:56:22,445 --> 00:56:24,345
- Why?
- Because she wasa woman, no?

867
00:56:29,386 --> 00:56:31,752
Next one, little non-veg, okay?

868
00:56:32,389 --> 00:56:37,349
Speakingabout woman... Why do
they always fake orgasms? Why?

869
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:40,088
- Why?
- Because they think we care!

870
00:56:41,398 --> 00:56:43,764
Stop it man! It's not funny.

871
00:56:45,402 --> 00:56:46,369
Next one.

872
00:56:46,469 --> 00:56:49,370
Why didthe woman
die crossingthe road?

873
00:56:50,407 --> 00:56:52,102
Who cares? What was she doing
outside the kitchen...

874
00:56:52,409 --> 00:56:53,376
...in the first place?

875
00:56:56,813 --> 00:57:00,374
In the garden,
Ajay triedto touch me.

876
00:57:00,483 --> 00:57:02,781
But I said 'No! '.
Shouldn't be allowed.

877
00:57:06,423 --> 00:57:08,789
Mr. Ajay. I can cross the road.

878
00:57:09,426 --> 00:57:12,122
And It's one thing to make
jokes about Ritu...

879
00:57:12,429 --> 00:57:15,398
...but I will not stand
for any jokesabout women.

880
00:57:20,437 --> 00:57:22,803
Can I crack one more joke
about Ritu Madam?

881
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:26,136
What is the reason for this?

882
00:57:26,443 --> 00:57:28,411
You have the lowest pointsalso.
From all the rounds.

883
00:57:28,511 --> 00:57:30,138
You broke the rules.

884
00:57:30,447 --> 00:57:32,415
In life, the lower you score,
the lower your chances.

885
00:57:32,515 --> 00:57:34,813
Someone with an MBA
should know that!

886
00:57:36,453 --> 00:57:38,819
I would like to say bye to Maya.

887
00:57:46,463 --> 00:57:47,828
Everybody get some rest!

888
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:52,435
Bloody, what these people know?
Nothing!

889
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:56,439
Do they even know? That there is
a village in Arunachal Pradesh...

890
00:57:56,539 --> 00:57:59,838
...which has women, and
they are all archers.

891
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:05,448
They hunt and they eat,
half woman, half pigmy!

892
00:58:05,548 --> 00:58:07,846
Like that woman, Samantha!

893
00:58:14,491 --> 00:58:16,857
Andthis isa great country,
I don't want two women...

894
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:18,860
...from a PR agency to tell me that.

895
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:21,464
Jai Hind!

896
00:58:24,501 --> 00:58:25,866
And Jai Maharatshtra!

897
00:58:33,910 --> 00:58:39,473
If Bush shakes my hand, I
won't let go! What hands he has!

898
00:58:41,518 --> 00:58:42,485
Bloody.

899
00:58:42,852 --> 00:58:44,877
Everyone hasa price! Bush!

900
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:51,892
I have met, like, Shobha De...

901
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:54,895
...but where do you get to meet
someone big like him?

902
00:58:56,533 --> 00:58:58,899
Maybe in Sweden, where it's small.

903
00:58:59,035 --> 00:59:00,900
When I get Bush's hand...

904
00:59:01,538 --> 00:59:03,904
...the main focus will be
on the thrust!

905
00:59:04,007 --> 00:59:05,497
Bush isan ignorant dog...

906
00:59:05,608 --> 00:59:07,906
...who think that he isJesus's
substitute in the Free world!

907
00:59:09,145 --> 00:59:11,511
Afree world he neither
knows... Nor can spell!

908
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:20,523
Bush.

909
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:24,527
Kapil Dev.

910
00:59:32,569 --> 00:59:34,935
- Kapil Dev, Bush!
- Aslam.

911
00:59:41,578 --> 00:59:42,545
Sir?

912
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:45,548
Mr. Ambassador?

913
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:15,305
What on earth is going on here?

914
01:00:15,612 --> 01:00:17,910
Sir, this madam, has stolen
your thing!

915
01:00:18,014 --> 01:00:20,574
Every time this is becoming
an issue, sir!

916
01:00:20,683 --> 01:00:21,980
Sir, I am doing my job!

917
01:00:22,085 --> 01:00:23,916
The nerve... Nerve of
these animals nowadays!

918
01:00:25,622 --> 01:00:27,988
Leave! immediately!
Call your superior.

919
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:31,594
You know, you should keep
these low class people in check.

920
01:00:31,694 --> 01:00:33,594
Sometimes they bite also.

921
01:00:38,635 --> 01:00:40,000
Don't speak!

922
01:00:40,637 --> 01:00:42,605
Find me that Indian and get out!

923
01:00:42,705 --> 01:00:46,004
I don't ever want to see
you in Bombay again.

924
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:55,015
These are from earlier.

925
01:01:09,666 --> 01:01:12,032
- Madam...
- Please! - My goggles!

926
01:01:12,669 --> 01:01:14,637
She is on medication, sir.

927
01:01:21,678 --> 01:01:23,646
Why are you lettingthem
continue?

928
01:01:23,746 --> 01:01:26,647
I have no choice.
He is coming in six hours!

929
01:01:29,686 --> 01:01:30,653
What is this, man?

930
01:01:31,888 --> 01:01:35,654
I wasat the moviesand
there was this guy behind me...

931
01:01:35,758 --> 01:01:39,057
...with an axe... And you know.

932
01:02:24,140 --> 01:02:26,700
Wake up!
We're not here for a party!

933
01:02:26,809 --> 01:02:29,107
America is not a party!

934
01:02:29,746 --> 01:02:32,442
Bush will come
and shake my hand.

935
01:02:32,749 --> 01:02:34,444
Bush will come and
shake my hand.

936
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:36,719
- Take me to the promised land!
- Take me to the promised land!

937
01:02:36,819 --> 01:02:38,719
Handshake. Handshake. Handshake.

938
01:03:42,819 --> 01:03:46,778
Madam! The wealthiest man in
America is Warren Buffet bhai.

939
01:03:46,889 --> 01:03:48,186
He isa trader of stocks.

940
01:03:48,825 --> 01:03:49,792
He is the second wealthiest.

941
01:03:49,892 --> 01:03:52,793
The wealthiest man is Bill Gates
and he lives in Seattle...

942
01:03:52,895 --> 01:03:54,522
I've been to his house.

943
01:03:54,831 --> 01:03:56,799
Seriously? I love you man!

944
01:03:56,899 --> 01:03:58,799
- Mr. Ramesh...
- Yes?

945
01:03:58,901 --> 01:04:00,198
You're disqualified.

946
01:04:11,848 --> 01:04:14,817
Mr. Rohit, did you or
did you not complain...

947
01:04:14,917 --> 01:04:18,546
...that Mr. Ramesh has made
sexual advances towards you...

948
01:04:18,855 --> 01:04:20,823
...displayed
inappropriate behavior...

949
01:04:20,923 --> 01:04:24,222
...and hasacted in ungentlemanly
conduct towards your head.

950
01:04:24,861 --> 01:04:26,829
Which are violations of the basic
code of behavior...

951
01:04:26,929 --> 01:04:27,896
...of the competition.

952
01:04:28,264 --> 01:04:30,562
I did not complaint.

953
01:04:30,867 --> 01:04:34,564
But, what did I do to him? I
touched him slowly, that isall.

954
01:04:35,872 --> 01:04:37,840
Chill! I haven't saidanything.

955
01:04:38,875 --> 01:04:40,570
Even if we forget that...

956
01:04:40,877 --> 01:04:44,244
...would you like to comment on
your special relationship...

957
01:04:44,347 --> 01:04:45,575
...with Mr. Hari Srinivas?

958
01:04:45,882 --> 01:04:47,850
- Shivaraman.
- Shivaraman.

959
01:04:48,885 --> 01:04:49,852
Madam...

960
01:04:51,888 --> 01:04:54,857
I have no comment on it.
But I am telling you...

961
01:04:55,892 --> 01:04:56,859
...she's lying!

962
01:04:59,896 --> 01:05:04,595
The case is closed. You hidthis
information from us, Mr. Ramesh S.

963
01:05:04,901 --> 01:05:06,869
We do not allow liars
in this competition.

964
01:05:06,969 --> 01:05:09,597
But Madam, I have been a topper
from nursery school till now!

965
01:05:09,906 --> 01:05:10,873
You can not do this to me!

966
01:05:10,973 --> 01:05:12,600
The Indian law and
President Bush...

967
01:05:12,909 --> 01:05:14,604
...do not believe in homosexuality!

968
01:05:14,911 --> 01:05:16,606
But, but, but... Madam...

969
01:05:16,913 --> 01:05:18,278
I am performing all my tasks
as mentioned.

970
01:05:18,347 --> 01:05:19,881
The door is that way. Thank you!

971
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:21,611
But madam, I am not that homo
man. I will get married...

972
01:05:21,918 --> 01:05:23,613
- I needthis chance madam.
- Out!

973
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:25,285
Madam... Madam...

974
01:05:26,923 --> 01:05:28,618
Madam, I can solve any
mathematics problem...

975
01:05:28,925 --> 01:05:30,290
...in two minutes, Madam! Madam...

976
01:05:57,954 --> 01:06:01,321
And why that Maya isagainst?
Does she love Hari?

977
01:06:01,958 --> 01:06:03,653
Is she a South Indian hater?

978
01:06:04,961 --> 01:06:07,930
And where in the rules does it
say that Homosare not allowed?

979
01:06:09,966 --> 01:06:13,333
This is like that show Survivor.

980
01:06:14,370 --> 01:06:17,339
Except, I did not survive!

981
01:06:34,991 --> 01:06:36,959
Yes, the President is sleeping.

982
01:06:39,996 --> 01:06:41,691
That's the Presidential snore.

983
01:06:57,013 --> 01:06:58,981
What kind of party is going
on here?

984
01:06:59,081 --> 01:07:01,982
Oh, nothing happening. I was
just tryingto make some tea.

985
01:07:02,084 --> 01:07:04,985
Oh, tea? How lovely! I love tea!

986
01:07:06,022 --> 01:07:07,990
English language, English tea...

987
01:07:08,090 --> 01:07:09,990
But you're not allowed to cook
here. You know that, right?

988
01:07:15,431 --> 01:07:17,399
- Yes?
- Cash or cheque?

989
01:07:19,035 --> 01:07:21,401
- What? - No, Madam.
I can pay you in dollars!

990
01:07:23,439 --> 01:07:24,997
Look Madam, final offer.

991
01:07:26,042 --> 01:07:27,009
If you have a credit card
machine on you...

992
01:07:27,109 --> 01:07:29,407
...then it is not a problem
at all, we can just swipe!

993
01:07:32,048 --> 01:07:33,743
Straight in your bank
account it will go.

994
01:07:35,051 --> 01:07:36,018
Swipe!

995
01:07:36,385 --> 01:07:37,409
Excuse me.

996
01:07:39,055 --> 01:07:40,022
Eclair.

997
01:07:43,059 --> 01:07:45,027
Mmm... It's yummy!
Mmm... Creamy...

998
01:07:47,063 --> 01:07:51,022
Right. The score till now
Maya Roy, 112 points.

999
01:07:51,133 --> 01:07:54,432
Rohit and Archana, both
of you are tied at 84 points.

1000
01:07:54,537 --> 01:07:58,029
And Kapil, points. So Kapil...

1001
01:07:58,140 --> 01:08:00,768
- Sam, there'sa mistake.
- Really?

1002
01:08:01,077 --> 01:08:04,046
Yeah, Kapil has 175, not 75.

1003
01:08:06,082 --> 01:08:08,050
You know, he did very well in
the Talent Round with the stocks...

1004
01:08:08,150 --> 01:08:11,449
I judged him. You asked me to
keep the scores, no?

1005
01:08:12,088 --> 01:08:15,455
- So Kapil Dev, 175.
- Right... Uh...

1006
01:08:21,097 --> 01:08:25,056
Yeah okay, so then... Rohit
and Archana, one of you...

1007
01:08:33,109 --> 01:08:35,077
See in case the President can't
understand what you're saying...

1008
01:08:35,177 --> 01:08:37,077
...we are tryingto make him
feel at home.

1009
01:08:37,179 --> 01:08:40,478
Americans shaking hands
with Americans, that's the goal!

1010
01:08:41,117 --> 01:08:42,812
Accentsare my bitches, you!

1011
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:45,087
Maya.

1012
01:08:48,124 --> 01:08:49,489
You talking to me?

1013
01:08:53,129 --> 01:08:56,098
Excuse me, you talking to me?

1014
01:08:58,134 --> 01:09:01,501
That's from 'Taxi Driver'.
Robert De Niro.

1015
01:09:01,737 --> 01:09:04,831
Bravo, bravo!
I mean seriously...

1016
01:09:05,141 --> 01:09:07,837
I almost thought I was watching
the movie there for a minute.

1017
01:09:08,277 --> 01:09:11,110
Ritu, big score! Big score!

1018
01:09:18,154 --> 01:09:20,122
My name is Gordon Gekko...

1019
01:09:20,489 --> 01:09:23,117
...and I am here to tell
you that greed is good!

1020
01:09:31,167 --> 01:09:34,136
- Very good Kapil! Excellent!
- Thank you, Madam.

1021
01:09:37,173 --> 01:09:38,140
Archana?

1022
01:09:43,179 --> 01:09:46,148
I'm like Archana. I'm, like,
totally happy to meet you.

1023
01:09:49,518 --> 01:09:51,145
I... Lip...

1024
01:10:02,198 --> 01:10:03,563
I did okay, right?

1025
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:05,167
Right.

1026
01:10:05,267 --> 01:10:06,234
Rohit?

1027
01:10:21,283 --> 01:10:22,250
- Rohit...
- No, one minute.

1028
01:10:22,351 --> 01:10:24,182
You are missingthe whole
point of this round!

1029
01:10:41,337 --> 01:10:42,599
Speakeazy! I didthat.

1030
01:10:43,239 --> 01:10:44,604
Has he taken drugs?

1031
01:10:45,241 --> 01:10:47,209
Rohit, what are you
talking about?

1032
01:10:49,245 --> 01:10:50,610
I don't know.

1033
01:11:46,302 --> 01:11:47,667
What are you doing?

1034
01:11:50,306 --> 01:11:53,275
I don't need Bush to
be a better Archana.

1035
01:12:02,318 --> 01:12:03,285
Let's go.

1036
01:12:14,330 --> 01:12:17,299
Daddy, will you please stop
tryingto kill Rohit?

1037
01:12:17,666 --> 01:12:19,293
I'm with him.

1038
01:12:23,339 --> 01:12:24,697
- Fast!
- Madam it's not coming out.

1039
01:12:24,773 --> 01:12:27,037
I cannot promise anythingjust
do it quickly, come on!

1040
01:12:27,343 --> 01:12:28,310
What's the story here?

1041
01:12:31,347 --> 01:12:33,713
No Madam, it's not what you
think... It's not sex.

1042
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:35,317
Just cash!

1043
01:12:37,353 --> 01:12:38,320
Sam!

1044
01:12:43,359 --> 01:12:47,318
Abribe as Swami Vivekananda
had said, is not cool...

1045
01:12:47,429 --> 01:12:49,329
But you asked me to take
the bribe, no?

1046
01:12:49,765 --> 01:12:53,326
To get evidence. How else would
I get evidence, Sam?

1047
01:12:54,370 --> 01:12:57,339
Now you know what the consulate
will do if they find out?

1048
01:12:58,374 --> 01:12:59,739
John my lose his job.

1049
01:13:01,377 --> 01:13:04,346
But I won't tell anyone.
Because I'm your friend.

1050
01:13:06,715 --> 01:13:08,342
And because...

1051
01:13:09,385 --> 01:13:12,354
...you will let me go for
breakfast with the president.

1052
01:13:12,454 --> 01:13:17,357
Because you will suddenly
fall sick... And can't go.

1053
01:13:19,395 --> 01:13:20,362
Right?

1054
01:13:22,398 --> 01:13:23,365
Right.

1055
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:26,368
Good... Good girl.

1056
01:13:29,405 --> 01:13:33,364
- Sam? - Now what
have you done Ritu?

1057
01:13:38,414 --> 01:13:39,381
Fuck you!

1058
01:13:39,481 --> 01:13:43,781
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you
andthat Maya friend of yours!

1059
01:13:44,420 --> 01:13:45,387
Ritu, Relax!

1060
01:13:45,487 --> 01:13:48,388
I did all these questionnaires
andall this paper work.

1061
01:13:48,490 --> 01:13:50,117
- Ritu! - What will you
do without me Sam?

1062
01:13:50,426 --> 01:13:54,726
Zenith is nothing without me Sam.
We got this PRjob because of me!

1063
01:13:56,432 --> 01:13:58,127
I don't needthis, Sam.
I don't!

1064
01:13:58,434 --> 01:14:00,800
Ritu calm down.
Ritu come back, Ritu!

1065
01:14:03,439 --> 01:14:05,407
Is the invitation here?

1066
01:14:12,448 --> 01:14:14,416
You don't look like
you'll take money.

1067
01:14:17,453 --> 01:14:18,420
For what?

1068
01:14:19,455 --> 01:14:20,422
To leave.

1069
01:14:21,457 --> 01:14:25,416
- Leave where?
- This room.

1070
01:14:27,463 --> 01:14:28,430
Oh a bribe!

1071
01:14:30,466 --> 01:14:32,832
No, I'm not
goingto take a bribe.

1072
01:14:33,469 --> 01:14:34,436
Good.

1073
01:14:35,471 --> 01:14:38,838
No, I wasn't offering you
a bribe. I was testing you.

1074
01:14:40,476 --> 01:14:41,443
You passed.

1075
01:15:11,507 --> 01:15:15,876
Last andfinal round is to test
your general knowledge...

1076
01:15:15,978 --> 01:15:17,468
...about America.

1077
01:15:17,579 --> 01:15:18,546
Maya...

1078
01:15:19,515 --> 01:15:23,212
Which U. S President
wasassassinated in?

1079
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:25,885
- John F. Kennedy.
- Correct answer.

1080
01:15:26,522 --> 01:15:28,888
- Kapil. Who was the first
President... - George Washington!

1081
01:15:30,526 --> 01:15:31,891
That's the right answer...

1082
01:15:33,529 --> 01:15:35,497
Maya, who directedTaxi Driver?

1083
01:15:36,532 --> 01:15:37,897
Martin Scorccesse.

1084
01:15:38,534 --> 01:15:41,503
Right answer.
Kapil, where was...

1085
01:15:41,603 --> 01:15:42,570
Los Angeles.

1086
01:15:44,540 --> 01:15:47,236
- Kapil, are you cheating?
- No, why?

1087
01:15:47,543 --> 01:15:49,511
He has the answers
written on hisarm.

1088
01:15:49,878 --> 01:15:51,505
I don't have the answers
written on my arm.

1089
01:15:52,548 --> 01:15:54,243
Did Ritu give you the answers?

1090
01:15:54,550 --> 01:15:56,518
I don't know what you
are talkingabout.

1091
01:15:57,553 --> 01:15:59,521
Why are you hiding your arm
if you don't have answers...

1092
01:15:59,621 --> 01:16:00,918
...written on it?

1093
01:16:01,557 --> 01:16:03,923
I'm not hiding,
I'm just stretching.

1094
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:06,528
- Show me your arm.
- Here! See!

1095
01:16:06,628 --> 01:16:08,255
Madam... Madam... Madam!

1096
01:16:10,566 --> 01:16:13,535
These are answers to the quiz
questions by question number.

1097
01:16:13,635 --> 01:16:14,932
- No, they are not.
- Yes, they are.

1098
01:16:15,037 --> 01:16:16,527
What are they,
if they aren't answers?

1099
01:16:17,573 --> 01:16:19,939
They are just answers to
questions I often think about.

1100
01:16:20,576 --> 01:16:22,271
Kapil, stop making
a fool of yourself.

1101
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:24,538
- Don't move!
- Oh my God!

1102
01:16:24,646 --> 01:16:25,613
What are you doing?

1103
01:16:25,714 --> 01:16:26,681
I will hurt her! I will hurt you!

1104
01:16:26,782 --> 01:16:29,273
No no no, don't hurt her.
Guard!

1105
01:16:29,585 --> 01:16:31,553
- Do you have a weapon?
- No, how will I?

1106
01:16:31,653 --> 01:16:33,280
They have a security
check outside no?

1107
01:16:33,589 --> 01:16:34,556
Then what will you do?
Hit me?

1108
01:16:34,656 --> 01:16:37,557
- Hey! I have a gun at home.
- And how will you go home?

1109
01:16:37,659 --> 01:16:38,956
I don't know, but I will.

1110
01:16:39,595 --> 01:16:40,960
I will break her neck!
I will break your neck!

1111
01:16:41,597 --> 01:16:42,564
You'll never get away with this.

1112
01:16:42,664 --> 01:16:44,291
Madam, these aren't answers
to the quiz questions!

1113
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:46,295
- Yes they are!
- Shit yaar!

1114
01:16:46,602 --> 01:16:51,562
Madam! Madam... Madam...
Madam! Madam! Madam!

1115
01:16:52,608 --> 01:16:54,974
I didn't do anything Madam!

1116
01:16:56,612 --> 01:16:58,580
How much? Madam,
I can pay you both!

1117
01:17:34,650 --> 01:17:38,017
My team will be servinga lightly
poached eggand a Boston muffin.

1118
01:17:38,153 --> 01:17:39,620
I hadto get it from Boston.

1119
01:17:39,721 --> 01:17:41,621
I am sure he will like it
because in India it's not there.

1120
01:17:42,658 --> 01:17:46,025
Otherwise there will be crispy
toast, coffee and bacon.

1121
01:17:46,662 --> 01:17:49,631
- I chose the pick myself.
- And everyone will wear gloves.

1122
01:17:50,666 --> 01:17:51,633
That's true.

1123
01:17:57,072 --> 01:17:58,972
We're ready for
you, Mr. President.

1124
01:18:02,678 --> 01:18:04,043
Hello, Mr. President!

1125
01:18:06,682 --> 01:18:11,051
I... I like the ends of your
fingers... Tips... Finger tips.

1126
01:18:11,687 --> 01:18:15,054
It's exactly like a CEO's,
but fragile.

1127
01:18:15,691 --> 01:18:16,658
Exactly!

1128
01:18:20,696 --> 01:18:22,391
What's your favorite memory?

1129
01:18:24,700 --> 01:18:26,065
- Of what?
- Anything.

1130
01:18:27,703 --> 01:18:30,399
I like watching planes
landing safely.

1131
01:18:30,706 --> 01:18:32,674
So important in today's world!

1132
01:18:33,709 --> 01:18:34,676
What's yours?

1133
01:18:35,711 --> 01:18:40,671
Oh, well... in Assam, I once
hearda midget playing...

1134
01:18:40,782 --> 01:18:42,079
'Vande Matram' on the banjo.

1135
01:18:42,184 --> 01:18:46,086
And you know what his t-shirt
said? India Size does Matter!

1136
01:18:47,723 --> 01:18:48,690
Isn't that just...

1137
01:18:49,725 --> 01:18:52,091
Oh my God!
What happenedthere?

1138
01:18:52,194 --> 01:18:54,424
Nothing, It's just badfurniture.

1139
01:18:54,730 --> 01:18:55,697
Yeah, but how can a table
just collapse?

1140
01:18:55,797 --> 01:18:57,424
Sam, just let it be... Sam!
One sec... Let it be Sam!

1141
01:18:57,733 --> 01:19:00,099
Don't touch it Sam,
it's concentratedacid!

1142
01:19:00,736 --> 01:19:01,703
What?

1143
01:19:01,803 --> 01:19:04,431
Nothing, just forget about
that It's not important.

1144
01:19:04,740 --> 01:19:05,707
Listen to me Sam.

1145
01:19:05,807 --> 01:19:07,434
If you understand me,
like I think you do.

1146
01:19:07,743 --> 01:19:11,702
Can I share a secret with you?
Like a couple? Yes?

1147
01:19:13,749 --> 01:19:16,445
- What do you think this is?
- A... A tea bag?

1148
01:19:16,752 --> 01:19:18,720
That's what I thought.
Yet it is deceptive!

1149
01:19:18,820 --> 01:19:20,720
Like a Dickens novel.

1150
01:19:20,822 --> 01:19:23,450
See, inside this bagare
two volatile powders, okay?

1151
01:19:23,759 --> 01:19:26,455
And when it comes in contact
with hot water like that...

1152
01:19:26,762 --> 01:19:29,128
...it makes the world's smallest
and quickest bomb!

1153
01:19:29,765 --> 01:19:31,460
I have been working on
it all night.

1154
01:19:31,767 --> 01:19:34,133
Sam, I got burnt... See,
I have scars.

1155
01:19:34,770 --> 01:19:36,135
It wasa little complicated...
you know... with the timing...

1156
01:19:36,238 --> 01:19:38,729
...and everything... But I've finally
figured it out Sam!

1157
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:43,142
And we are going to have Bush
with a burnt face! Finally!

1158
01:19:46,782 --> 01:19:49,751
Sam what happened?
Why are you crying Sam?

1159
01:19:50,786 --> 01:19:53,755
Listen don't be so worried.
Its goingto be fine.

1160
01:19:53,855 --> 01:19:56,085
I have told my associates,
they're going to pick us up...

1161
01:19:56,191 --> 01:19:58,751
...from an undisclosed location
right after he dies.

1162
01:19:59,795 --> 01:20:01,160
There is goingto be so
much chaos.

1163
01:20:01,263 --> 01:20:02,753
Sam! No one will ever know.

1164
01:20:04,199 --> 01:20:05,166
Sam...

1165
01:20:06,802 --> 01:20:08,167
Sam are you with me?

1166
01:20:10,806 --> 01:20:11,773
Sam?

1167
01:20:15,811 --> 01:20:17,506
What's wrong with you? Sam!
Get off me! You don't understand!

1168
01:20:17,813 --> 01:20:19,781
Stop it!
Sam you don't understand!

1169
01:20:19,881 --> 01:20:21,508
I'll get you for this!

1170
01:20:29,825 --> 01:20:32,191
What are you doing with
my bag? Leave my bag!

1171
01:20:34,830 --> 01:20:35,797
Sam!

1172
01:20:36,832 --> 01:20:37,799
SAM!

1173
01:20:41,169 --> 01:20:43,535
- Is the young Indian ready?
- Almost.

1174
01:20:43,839 --> 01:20:45,204
You've got two minutes.

1175
01:21:45,300 --> 01:21:46,584
Welcome Mr. President!

1176
01:21:46,619 --> 01:21:47,869
The young Indian...

1177
01:21:50,906 --> 01:21:53,875
- Are you the young Indian?
- No, Sir. He is!

1178
01:23:41,082 --> 01:23:45,041
Bush, Brother...
You changed my life.
