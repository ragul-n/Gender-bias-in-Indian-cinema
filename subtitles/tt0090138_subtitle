1
00:01:17,034 --> 00:01:24,548
"The holy Almighty."

2
00:01:24,628 --> 00:01:31,330
"In the name of God the merciful
and compassionate."

3
00:01:32,114 --> 00:01:39,184
"In the name of God the merciful
and compassionate."

4
00:01:39,638 --> 00:01:46,765
"We bow to you in your court."

5
00:01:47,011 --> 00:01:53,992
"We are the servants
in your government."

6
00:02:04,315 --> 00:02:11,882
"You are the owner,
you are the provider."

7
00:02:12,147 --> 00:02:19,503
"You know the secrets of our hearts."

8
00:02:19,583 --> 00:02:27,269
"Show us the way to righteousness."

9
00:02:27,496 --> 00:02:34,925
"For the sake of your lord."

10
00:02:35,005 --> 00:02:42,643
"Give the heart
the wealth of this world."

11
00:02:42,723 --> 00:02:49,733
"God grant us Love."

12
00:02:50,543 --> 00:02:57,992
"The holy Almighty."

13
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:05,647
"In the name of God the merciful
and compassionate."

14
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:13,226
"In the name of God the merciful
and compassionate."

15
00:03:29,192 --> 00:03:30,213
Greetings, Bai Amma (Mother)!

16
00:03:30,363 --> 00:03:32,741
When did you come, Saeeda?
- Yesterday!

17
00:03:32,954 --> 00:03:34,490
Is everything fine?
- Your blessings!

18
00:03:36,013 --> 00:03:36,694
Be blessed!

19
00:03:36,774 --> 00:03:38,045
Greetings!
- Greetings!

20
00:03:38,829 --> 00:03:40,969
Greetings!
- What's this child doing this morning?

21
00:03:49,907 --> 00:03:50,738
Come Nagar!

22
00:03:50,818 --> 00:03:54,493
Greetings Mr. Dawood!
- Greetings!

23
00:03:55,793 --> 00:03:56,801
What have you brought today?

24
00:03:57,076 --> 00:04:01,868
This is a plate, and this is a sweet
made of gram. And it's to be eaten.

25
00:04:04,016 --> 00:04:05,175
What's there to laugh in this?

26
00:04:09,326 --> 00:04:11,160
Very nice! Did you prepare it?

27
00:04:11,358 --> 00:04:14,868
No, mother!
So father said send it to Dawood.

28
00:04:15,218 --> 00:04:18,385
Must have lost the taste in
his mouth by eating from the market.

29
00:04:18,652 --> 00:04:22,285
So, mother said,
do make him eat in front of you.

30
00:04:23,285 --> 00:04:25,285
There! Time to go to the office.

31
00:04:25,496 --> 00:04:26,781
So, shall I go?

32
00:04:26,861 --> 00:04:27,828
Of course! Let me dress up.

33
00:04:27,908 --> 00:04:29,910
Okay! Tell thanks
to father for the sweet.

34
00:04:30,808 --> 00:04:32,785
This watch has become my enemy.

35
00:04:32,868 --> 00:04:35,743
You go! Go!
- Going!

36
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:38,118
Greetings, mother!
- Why have you stopped there? Go!

37
00:04:38,201 --> 00:04:39,326
Get my dress, quickly, mother!

38
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:41,326
As it is I am late.
- Okay, take! - What are you doing?

39
00:04:42,088 --> 00:04:44,368
So quickly it's 8 o' clock,
now a days.

40
00:04:44,965 --> 00:04:46,069
What is this?

41
00:04:47,814 --> 00:04:48,952
Easy! Easy!

42
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:51,160
I can never find the
right way to this dress.

43
00:04:51,243 --> 00:04:53,326
Why are you wrestling with the dress?

44
00:04:53,688 --> 00:04:55,105
As it is I am late, mother.

45
00:04:55,222 --> 00:04:57,660
If I miss the 8:13 bus,
Lala Fakirchand will fire me so bad...

46
00:04:57,743 --> 00:04:59,326
...that I won't feel hungry. Yes!

47
00:04:59,533 --> 00:05:00,701
How much do you eat?

48
00:05:01,056 --> 00:05:03,451
Will the grain prices fall in the city
if you don't feel hungry?

49
00:05:04,485 --> 00:05:05,704
Okay, mother, I am going! Bye!

50
00:05:05,832 --> 00:05:07,643
Eat something and go!
- No! I'll miss the bus.

51
00:05:07,723 --> 00:05:08,660
Look, Dawood!

52
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,573
If you don't bother about eating,
then take out...

53
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,987
...my 6 month's rent,
and vacate the room!

54
00:05:19,032 --> 00:05:20,109
Look mother!

55
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,118
Scold me as much you may want to.

56
00:05:22,951 --> 00:05:24,340
But send me away from you. Okay?

57
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:26,682
Who else do I have,
in this world, than you?

58
00:05:26,855 --> 00:05:27,961
Then eat!

59
00:05:29,424 --> 00:05:30,743
Fine! I'll eat on the way. Okay?
- Alright!

60
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:31,701
Wait! Wait!

61
00:05:31,785 --> 00:05:32,663
What's it, mother?
I am getting late!

62
00:05:32,743 --> 00:05:34,042
Take this! Take this 5 rupees!

63
00:05:34,655 --> 00:05:36,368
Have your lunch too. Take!

64
00:05:41,903 --> 00:05:43,300
Why don't you come in line, brother?

65
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:45,965
Everyone will get a seat.
You'll just keep pushing.

66
00:05:47,593 --> 00:05:48,660
Strange!

67
00:05:52,723 --> 00:05:55,743
Brother!
- Okay, master!

68
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,731
Someone has felt behind.
Whose is this?

69
00:06:07,854 --> 00:06:09,003
'Band Darwaza' (The closed Door).

70
00:06:11,036 --> 00:06:12,278
Kainat Mirza.

71
00:06:12,717 --> 00:06:15,680
Silver beach, 55 Juhu, Bombay.

72
00:06:26,269 --> 00:06:27,443
Yes, tell me!

73
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:31,672
I wish to meet Kainat Mirza.

74
00:06:32,317 --> 00:06:33,364
I am Kainat.

75
00:06:37,642 --> 00:06:39,413
Sorry, I never knew you.

76
00:06:40,007 --> 00:06:42,292
But, I still did not recognize you.

77
00:06:42,722 --> 00:06:43,698
My name is Dawood.

78
00:06:44,323 --> 00:06:45,753
Dawood Ali Khan Yusuf Zaid.

79
00:06:46,275 --> 00:06:50,163
Well! You have such a lengthy
name at such a young age.

80
00:06:50,908 --> 00:06:51,936
Thanks!

81
00:06:52,407 --> 00:06:54,182
I am such a mad.

82
00:06:54,518 --> 00:06:56,157
I left the manuscript
of the novel in the bus.

83
00:06:58,259 --> 00:07:00,175
Greetings, Mr. Lala!
- Greetings!

84
00:07:00,509 --> 00:07:01,646
Greetings!

85
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:03,842
Greetings, Mr. Lala!
- Greetings!

86
00:07:03,925 --> 00:07:05,634
There is a new edition
of Krishna Sopti.

87
00:07:05,714 --> 00:07:08,687
Greetings, Mr. Lala!
- Be blessed, Fatima!

88
00:07:09,355 --> 00:07:10,988
Dawood! Hasn't Dawood come?

89
00:07:11,422 --> 00:07:12,639
Greetings sir!

90
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,302
Sorry for being late.

91
00:07:14,382 --> 00:07:16,991
Say sorry later.
First I want the list of...

92
00:07:17,071 --> 00:07:18,147
...books published this month.

93
00:07:18,227 --> 00:07:19,214
I'll get it right now!

94
00:07:19,846 --> 00:07:21,259
Greetings, uncle!
- Greetings!

95
00:07:21,514 --> 00:07:23,761
Send Mr. Suleman to me,
when he comes! - Okay!

96
00:07:24,283 --> 00:07:25,292
Just a minute, Mr. Hafiz!

97
00:07:25,563 --> 00:07:26,663
Where's the list?

98
00:07:27,452 --> 00:07:28,482
List.

99
00:07:36,549 --> 00:07:38,171
Dawood, come here!

100
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:40,216
Come! Come!

101
00:07:42,871 --> 00:07:44,382
I've made hot snacks.

102
00:07:44,749 --> 00:07:45,916
Come, be seated!

103
00:07:46,685 --> 00:07:48,026
I haven't seen my mother.

104
00:07:49,555 --> 00:07:50,902
But, even if she were to be..

105
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:54,889
..she would never have
loved me more than you.

106
00:07:55,133 --> 00:07:56,906
No nonsense! Take, have snacks!

107
00:08:01,198 --> 00:08:04,022
Dawood, you get married now.

108
00:08:04,102 --> 00:08:05,591
Marriage?
- Yes.

109
00:08:06,044 --> 00:08:08,958
Mother, I'm not able to
manage myself in 700 rupees.

110
00:08:09,129 --> 00:08:11,291
Where will I keep my wife?
- To hell with such a job.

111
00:08:11,511 --> 00:08:12,546
What else will I do?

112
00:08:13,457 --> 00:08:16,159
I suggest, get married to Nadira.

113
00:08:16,484 --> 00:08:18,958
To Nadira?
- Yes.

114
00:08:19,241 --> 00:08:21,874
Yes, he was saying,
"if you find some...

115
00:08:22,171 --> 00:08:25,541
... good boy, go to Haj after giving the
girl and the shoe shop to the son in law."

116
00:08:25,825 --> 00:08:27,624
Did I do my M.A to be selling shoes?

117
00:08:28,755 --> 00:08:31,742
No! You did M.A to
be beaten with shoes.

118
00:08:32,786 --> 00:08:35,656
By selling shoes your degree
papers might spoil, isn't it?

119
00:08:35,933 --> 00:08:37,048
Then you keep taking
the beatings of people.

120
00:08:37,295 --> 00:08:39,155
Mother, what all will
you bother about me?

121
00:08:39,499 --> 00:08:41,181
Eating, drinking, staying,
and now of my marriage too?

122
00:08:41,261 --> 00:08:42,337
Yes.

123
00:08:42,528 --> 00:08:43,961
Leave this marriage thing to me.

124
00:08:44,086 --> 00:08:46,253
One day I'll get you such
a daughter in law, you'll be amazed.

125
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:47,583
Really?
- Yes.

126
00:08:58,227 --> 00:08:59,860
Brother Salim,
please make the bill.

127
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:00,986
Okay!

128
00:09:01,272 --> 00:09:02,576
You?
- Greetings!

129
00:09:02,656 --> 00:09:03,685
Greetings! How come here?

130
00:09:04,018 --> 00:09:04,980
You had said that...

131
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:07,058
...you publish books at your place.
- Yes.

132
00:09:07,276 --> 00:09:10,185
So, I thought why not
take advantage of your source.

133
00:09:11,147 --> 00:09:13,581
Well! What am I worth? I am just a...

134
00:09:13,661 --> 00:09:17,070
At least you'd be worth referring me.

135
00:09:17,511 --> 00:09:19,837
Possibly, my novel might
get published from here.

136
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:24,524
Com in!
- Come!

137
00:09:27,429 --> 00:09:31,071
Sir, she is madam Kainat Mirza.

138
00:09:31,364 --> 00:09:34,631
Greetings!
- Greetings! Be seated!

139
00:09:35,689 --> 00:09:36,761
Thank you!

140
00:09:37,808 --> 00:09:38,634
Hey, Dawood!
- Yes sir.

141
00:09:38,717 --> 00:09:39,793
You too be seated!

142
00:09:41,726 --> 00:09:42,873
Thank you Sir.

143
00:09:44,477 --> 00:09:49,092
Sir, Kainat Mirza
is a fantastic writer.

144
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:52,936
Dawood is applauding my handwriting.

145
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:56,899
Whatever you'd be writing
would surely be good.

146
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:02,259
Such sense of humor,
we only get to see rarely.

147
00:10:02,652 --> 00:10:03,690
Thanks!

148
00:10:03,927 --> 00:10:05,601
Well! What do you write?

149
00:10:05,798 --> 00:10:06,855
Don't know!

150
00:10:06,935 --> 00:10:10,913
But I had read somewhere that
everybody has a novel in their life.

151
00:10:11,087 --> 00:10:12,161
So, I wrote it.

152
00:10:12,631 --> 00:10:16,074
But I don't know if, what
I have written, is a novel or not.

153
00:10:16,335 --> 00:10:19,253
Sir, I have turned
it here and there to see.

154
00:10:19,557 --> 00:10:23,418
Whatever she has written would
not just be a novel, but a good novel.

155
00:10:24,025 --> 00:10:26,085
If it's a good novel,
then why have we not printed it, yet?

156
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:28,573
That's why we have brought her to you.

157
00:10:29,007 --> 00:10:29,999
Look, Miss. Mirza.

158
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:31,223
Please call me Kainat.

159
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:33,719
As per our traditions...

160
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:34,850
Sir!
- Yes.

161
00:10:35,753 --> 00:10:38,231
Excuse me, Mr. Salim, in the shop...

162
00:10:38,901 --> 00:10:40,307
Listen!
- Yes, sir!

163
00:10:40,513 --> 00:10:42,018
Please tell for the tea!
- Okay sir!

164
00:10:44,357 --> 00:10:45,720
Dawood!
- Yes, Mr. Lala!

165
00:10:47,064 --> 00:10:47,998
Pack this and keep it there!

166
00:10:48,259 --> 00:10:49,337
Okay!
- Yes!

167
00:10:49,448 --> 00:10:50,414
Won't you
take your salary today?

168
00:10:51,593 --> 00:10:52,923
Yes, Mr. Lala!

169
00:10:54,379 --> 00:10:55,580
Without a salary how will I eat?

170
00:10:56,009 --> 00:10:58,658
My bad days begin right
from day one of the month.

171
00:11:00,176 --> 00:11:01,882
Who was that madam?

172
00:11:02,977 --> 00:11:04,049
She's a new writer.

173
00:11:05,052 --> 00:11:06,840
New and beautiful too.

174
00:11:10,782 --> 00:11:12,875
Excuse me! What happened?

175
00:11:13,494 --> 00:11:15,937
He has kept the novel.
He said he would read and inform.

176
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:18,043
That's a nice news!

177
00:11:18,123 --> 00:11:19,688
You can say you've
won half the battle.

178
00:11:19,864 --> 00:11:21,485
Do you plan to offer sweets or not?

179
00:11:21,565 --> 00:11:24,001
Sweets? You come to my house..

180
00:11:24,081 --> 00:11:26,496
..I'll treat you with Lucknow cuisine,
made by my mother.

181
00:11:28,207 --> 00:11:30,414
Mouth is watering.
Surely I'll come.

182
00:11:30,845 --> 00:11:33,763
Okay, bye for now!
- Bye!

183
00:11:35,332 --> 00:11:37,891
Dawood! Mr. Dawood!
- Sir!

184
00:11:38,591 --> 00:11:40,460
I am going to meet Mahinder
Singh Bedi.

185
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:41,450
Okay!
- Will not come back to office.

186
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:44,523
Okay!
- Anyways, I am busy for few days.

187
00:11:45,008 --> 00:11:47,952
You do one thing.
That madam Kainat Mirza who had come...

188
00:11:48,035 --> 00:11:49,077
...you know?
- Yes!

189
00:11:49,226 --> 00:11:50,634
Read her manuscript.

190
00:11:52,007 --> 00:11:53,346
Give me your opinion about this.

191
00:11:53,466 --> 00:11:54,621
Okay!
- In few lines.

192
00:11:54,825 --> 00:11:55,910
I'll see the rest.

193
00:11:56,987 --> 00:11:58,111
Nice girl!

194
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:06,038
Listen, Miss. Kainat! Listen!

195
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:08,868
What happened?

196
00:12:09,248 --> 00:12:12,283
After you left, Mr. Suleiman
gave me your manuscript to read.

197
00:12:12,413 --> 00:12:14,743
I came running to tell you this.
- Thanks!

198
00:12:14,988 --> 00:12:16,118
That's a good news.

199
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:17,827
I'll read and tell the good news.

200
00:12:20,264 --> 00:12:22,259
Well! What's your subject
of your novel?

201
00:12:22,664 --> 00:12:23,742
Courtesan!

202
00:12:24,902 --> 00:12:26,243
Can I ask why you
have taken this subject?

203
00:12:26,805 --> 00:12:28,035
Is there anything bad in it?

204
00:12:28,783 --> 00:12:29,978
No, nothing bad.

205
00:12:30,556 --> 00:12:34,910
Normally, the writer take up issues
that are known to them, or understood.

206
00:12:35,626 --> 00:12:37,118
I don't think you know
so much about Courtesans...

207
00:12:37,202 --> 00:12:38,535
....that you can write about them.

208
00:12:39,543 --> 00:12:42,910
Well, Mr. Dawood!
It might be bad to hear.

209
00:12:43,313 --> 00:12:44,410
But it is an absolute truth.

210
00:12:45,065 --> 00:12:47,204
That, every woman in
the world is a commodity.

211
00:12:48,156 --> 00:12:50,535
Whether she's sold at home,
or in the market.

212
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:52,910
Sometimes she's sold for money.

213
00:12:53,324 --> 00:12:54,540
Sometimes to make a family.

214
00:12:55,367 --> 00:12:57,618
Sometimes she's sold by herself,
by her own will.

215
00:12:57,994 --> 00:12:59,411
Sometimes she is sold away.

216
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,585
So, Mr. Dawood, if you see.

217
00:13:02,113 --> 00:13:04,198
Every woman is a courtesan, in a way.

218
00:13:06,351 --> 00:13:07,952
I cannot say that
your thought is right.

219
00:13:08,858 --> 00:13:10,035
But it does carry weight.

220
00:13:13,637 --> 00:13:15,861
About the novel,
I can only tell after reading it.

221
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:19,167
But I am sure it's interesting.
- Thanks!

222
00:13:19,853 --> 00:13:21,832
Talking away, I didn't realize.

223
00:13:21,953 --> 00:13:22,964
Look, I've reached home!

224
00:13:23,313 --> 00:13:24,456
So, good bye!

225
00:13:24,844 --> 00:13:25,933
No way!

226
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:28,546
Unless you don't come
inside to have a cup of tea,

227
00:13:28,626 --> 00:13:30,876
God will neither protect you nor me.

228
00:13:31,015 --> 00:13:32,902
Oh no! Never disappoint god!

229
00:13:32,982 --> 00:13:34,672
Come!
- Okay!

230
00:13:41,648 --> 00:13:45,539
Mother! Mother, this Mr. Dawood.

231
00:13:45,619 --> 00:13:46,999
Greetings!
- Be blessed, son!

232
00:13:47,269 --> 00:13:48,722
Be seated!
- Please come!

233
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:55,610
Mother, Dawood is helping
me to publish my novel.

234
00:13:55,886 --> 00:13:57,152
May god bless you, son!

235
00:13:57,897 --> 00:14:00,816
If her book be published,
if we have some money.

236
00:14:01,162 --> 00:14:02,726
Then we can get rid of our bad times.

237
00:14:06,883 --> 00:14:10,073
This, whatever you see, is all a show.

238
00:14:10,729 --> 00:14:13,156
Kainat's father had made many.

239
00:14:13,778 --> 00:14:15,073
But he suddenly passed away.

240
00:14:15,735 --> 00:14:17,097
We have this house left.

241
00:14:17,422 --> 00:14:18,714
That too a rented one.

242
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:21,187
Forget it mother. Why talk sad things?

243
00:14:21,497 --> 00:14:23,720
I had promised tea to Dawood.

244
00:14:23,825 --> 00:14:25,929
I'll get it right away!
- Just like that.

245
00:14:26,826 --> 00:14:28,323
You wait! I'll see!

246
00:14:31,613 --> 00:14:35,266
Waris Ali, you come later.
I have a guest at home.

247
00:14:35,626 --> 00:14:37,534
A guest. So what should I do?

248
00:14:37,912 --> 00:14:39,810
Give me the rent, I'll go away!

249
00:14:40,286 --> 00:14:41,867
We'll give your rent.

250
00:14:42,372 --> 00:14:45,622
Where you've waited so many days,
wait some more days.

251
00:14:45,845 --> 00:14:47,160
Why should I wait?

252
00:14:47,863 --> 00:14:52,080
Waris Ali,
we have nothing to give you now.

253
00:14:53,431 --> 00:14:54,828
Then you vacate the room!

254
00:14:55,053 --> 00:14:58,420
If you don't have money, why don't
the mother-daughter stay in slum?

255
00:14:58,570 --> 00:14:59,803
You are such ill-mannered man!

256
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:01,699
Don't you have manners
to talk to women?

257
00:15:01,993 --> 00:15:05,986
Sir, I am not here to learn mannerism.
But to take money.

258
00:15:06,296 --> 00:15:07,274
What? The money!

259
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:10,047
If your heart beats, then you give it.

260
00:15:12,004 --> 00:15:14,594
How much is it?
- Of seven months, rupees 350.

261
00:15:15,712 --> 00:15:17,969
The house is the subject.

262
00:15:18,189 --> 00:15:20,873
If it's vacated today,
2 lakh rupees will come by.

263
00:15:20,953 --> 00:15:21,882
2 lakh rupees will come by. Take this!

264
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:23,912
Your 350 rupees. Get lost! Get lost!

265
00:15:29,058 --> 00:15:30,263
Kainat..

266
00:15:34,284 --> 00:15:38,016
Neither can your tears take away the
world's problems, nor your worries.

267
00:15:39,733 --> 00:15:42,238
If you still wish to cry,
then you may.

268
00:15:42,749 --> 00:15:43,842
I will not stop you!

269
00:15:44,824 --> 00:15:47,435
I had come home, tired, in this worry.

270
00:15:48,814 --> 00:15:51,889
Don't worry! I shall read
your manuscript today itself.

271
00:15:53,603 --> 00:15:54,699
Yes!

272
00:15:57,082 --> 00:15:58,658
It was darkness until far away.

273
00:15:59,573 --> 00:16:00,919
Black and quite darkness.

274
00:16:01,581 --> 00:16:06,640
A tiny bulb, trembling,
was begging the darkness for its light.

275
00:16:07,485 --> 00:16:10,247
On the other side
there was closed door.

276
00:16:10,933 --> 00:16:13,300
There was the noise of the anklet
coming from behind the door.

277
00:16:14,026 --> 00:16:15,495
As though it was telling me..

278
00:16:15,739 --> 00:16:18,431
..Kainat Mirza,
if you really write stories..

279
00:16:18,657 --> 00:16:21,367
..then, have courage and
peep into this closed door..

280
00:16:21,803 --> 00:16:25,522
..and see the misbehavior
done with life.

281
00:16:31,302 --> 00:16:32,448
Who?

282
00:16:33,939 --> 00:16:35,102
Who is it, brother?

283
00:16:37,053 --> 00:16:39,831
Coming! Careful, the door will break!
Careful! Careful! Okay!

284
00:16:40,398 --> 00:16:41,482
Come on!

285
00:16:41,603 --> 00:16:43,620
Who are you? Who are you?
- Quite!

286
00:16:44,508 --> 00:16:46,383
My name is Raheem Shaikh!

287
00:16:46,837 --> 00:16:47,921
Have you ever heard, or not?

288
00:16:48,566 --> 00:16:50,045
No!
- Then hear it today!

289
00:16:51,182 --> 00:16:52,666
I am Raheem Shaikh!

290
00:16:53,883 --> 00:16:55,383
Means, Raheem the goon.

291
00:16:57,084 --> 00:16:58,179
Listen!

292
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:02,675
This girl will be in your house,
whole night.

293
00:17:02,846 --> 00:17:03,850
You understood?

294
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:06,224
This girl, in the house?
- Quite!

295
00:17:08,685 --> 00:17:13,690
If you move your tongue,
you'll not see the sun tomorrow. Heard?

296
00:17:13,992 --> 00:17:16,190
But, this...
- I told you once.

297
00:17:17,355 --> 00:17:20,458
If you move your tongue,
you'll be buried in this house.

298
00:17:21,269 --> 00:17:23,432
What? Right!

299
00:17:26,716 --> 00:17:27,758
Listen!

300
00:17:28,762 --> 00:17:30,550
I'll come and take
her tomorrow morning.

301
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:31,970
Got it?

302
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:33,105
Bloody hell!

303
00:17:33,648 --> 00:17:35,548
What problem is this?

304
00:17:36,188 --> 00:17:37,424
Who was this man?

305
00:17:37,691 --> 00:17:38,883
That was not a man.

306
00:17:39,529 --> 00:17:40,550
He was Raheem Shaikh!

307
00:17:40,858 --> 00:17:42,091
A goon from 'Jhumma Bhatti'.

308
00:17:43,216 --> 00:17:44,299
And I am Sultana.

309
00:17:44,379 --> 00:17:46,240
Whoever you are,
how can you stay in my house?

310
00:17:47,104 --> 00:17:49,323
Why didn't you tell this
to Raheem Shaikh?

311
00:17:50,842 --> 00:17:53,656
Well! Decency is another
name for weakness.

312
00:17:54,329 --> 00:17:57,551
I..I.. don't know what to do.

313
00:18:17,853 --> 00:18:19,204
Hey, you!

314
00:18:23,328 --> 00:18:25,277
I am talking to you. Up! Up!

315
00:18:26,703 --> 00:18:29,953
Actually, you are mistaken.

316
00:18:30,037 --> 00:18:32,120
Where is the
misunderstanding happening?

317
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:35,120
No one can fool constable Pandey.
- No!

318
00:18:35,203 --> 00:18:38,662
Seeing this kerchief on your neck
I knew 'What you are'.

319
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:40,620
Tell your name.

320
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:43,053
Dawood Mohammed Khan Yusuf Zaid.

321
00:18:43,296 --> 00:18:44,245
Very lengthy name.

322
00:18:44,787 --> 00:18:46,787
Dawood. Okay where do you stay?

323
00:18:47,037 --> 00:18:48,370
There, in that dwelling.

324
00:18:48,546 --> 00:18:49,953
Behind, there!
- Okay!

325
00:18:50,453 --> 00:18:52,953
Come on, money!
- I did not get the money sir.

326
00:18:53,037 --> 00:18:55,828
Not money. Profession. Work.

327
00:18:55,912 --> 00:18:56,703
What work do you do?

328
00:18:56,787 --> 00:18:57,745
Work?
- Yes.

329
00:18:57,828 --> 00:18:58,453
Sir, I am a writer.

330
00:18:58,537 --> 00:18:59,888
I am a writer.
- What?

331
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,287
Why did you not tell first?

332
00:19:02,154 --> 00:19:03,078
Please sit! Sit!

333
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:05,691
You are from my category.

334
00:19:06,127 --> 00:19:07,953
I am a fantastic writer too.
- Really?

335
00:19:08,037 --> 00:19:09,287
But I don't know to write.

336
00:19:10,662 --> 00:19:13,037
The brain is full of stories and ideas.

337
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:18,578
Just yesterday I got such an idea that,
I got crazy about it.

338
00:19:19,242 --> 00:19:20,287
Let me tell you.

339
00:19:22,521 --> 00:19:23,731
Fade in.

340
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:28,069
Draupati is bating in the pond.

341
00:19:28,636 --> 00:19:29,582
Why?

342
00:19:29,747 --> 00:19:31,620
You need to understand, partner.

343
00:19:31,703 --> 00:19:34,082
If Draupati does not bath in the pond..

344
00:19:34,162 --> 00:19:35,828
..from where will sex come from?

345
00:19:36,778 --> 00:19:38,078
Sex!
- Oh!

346
00:19:38,335 --> 00:19:41,828
We took Draupati as a heroine because..

347
00:19:41,912 --> 00:19:46,912
..how will the censor people
cut it if it's Draupati?

348
00:19:52,751 --> 00:19:56,120
So, Draupati is bating
with 'Lux' soap.

349
00:19:56,987 --> 00:19:58,061
With 'Lux' soap?
- Yes.

350
00:19:58,488 --> 00:19:59,196
Why?

351
00:19:59,276 --> 00:20:05,654
Because we shall take 50,000
rupees in the name of advertisement.

352
00:20:06,043 --> 00:20:07,287
Didn't get it?
- Yes, yes.

353
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:10,236
There's lots of ideas in this stories.

354
00:20:10,358 --> 00:20:13,203
So, Draupati comes out after bathing.

355
00:20:13,918 --> 00:20:18,398
After coming out, she ties up
a flowery Sari' of brand 'Fille Mill'.

356
00:20:18,609 --> 00:20:20,017
Advertisement number 2.

357
00:20:20,097 --> 00:20:20,620
Fifty Thousand.
- Yes.

358
00:20:20,703 --> 00:20:21,485
It's now 1 lakh. Isn't it?

359
00:20:21,612 --> 00:20:23,370
After that she wears a sandal,
branded 'Dawood'.

360
00:20:23,971 --> 00:20:27,296
If we wish we can put some
dialogues into Draupati's mouth.

361
00:20:27,845 --> 00:20:29,745
She smilingly tells her friend:

362
00:20:29,828 --> 00:20:32,375
Friend, I always wear 'Dawood' shoes.

363
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,570
This can wear off,
but cannot tear off.

364
00:20:35,705 --> 00:20:37,033
Cannot tear off.

365
00:20:38,275 --> 00:20:40,564
Are these Dawood people your relative?

366
00:20:41,145 --> 00:20:42,501
No! No!
- Then it's fine!

367
00:20:42,581 --> 00:20:44,995
If they are your relatives, we won't
get the money for the advertisement.

368
00:20:45,662 --> 00:20:48,030
Lese, we'll take off the 'Dawood'
sandal and replace with 'Bata'.

369
00:20:48,185 --> 00:20:50,495
How will it matter to Draupati?
The story.

370
00:20:52,036 --> 00:20:54,470
The story is in my hands. Control!
- Go ahead!

371
00:20:54,737 --> 00:20:55,652
Ahead?

372
00:20:56,543 --> 00:20:58,949
Draupati wears the sandal.

373
00:20:59,197 --> 00:21:01,870
And, a girl brings 'Cherry Blossom'
shoe polish.

374
00:21:01,953 --> 00:21:03,193
'Cherry Blossom' shoe polish?

375
00:21:03,273 --> 00:21:05,773
Hey partner, advertisement number 4.

376
00:21:05,942 --> 00:21:08,568
Two lakhs, without story.
- Free!

377
00:21:08,732 --> 00:21:11,373
These days there's more money
in the advertisement than the subject.

378
00:21:11,814 --> 00:21:16,175
We have lots of advertisement
in our subject, where's the story?

379
00:21:17,291 --> 00:21:20,021
Okay, partner,
let's talk business now, Okay?

380
00:21:20,917 --> 00:21:24,613
Let's make a team.
- Team? A pair?

381
00:21:24,819 --> 00:21:26,329
These days, it's the times of teams.

382
00:21:26,639 --> 00:21:28,726
Laxmikant-Pyarelal, Kalyanji-Anandji.

383
00:21:28,857 --> 00:21:31,248
Salim-Javed, Bappi Lahiri.

384
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:33,995
Hold on! Bappi Lahiri is one person.

385
00:21:34,815 --> 00:21:36,332
Well, this is cheating.

386
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:38,149
If I ever meet him, I will ask him...

387
00:21:38,229 --> 00:21:40,072
..."you being a single person,
how could you have double name?"

388
00:21:40,152 --> 00:21:42,037
This is wrong!
- Okay! We'll see.

389
00:21:42,501 --> 00:21:46,600
Partner, our team name
will be Dawood and Pandya.

390
00:21:47,224 --> 00:21:48,608
Dawood, Pandya.

391
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:50,652
Shake hands!

392
00:21:51,506 --> 00:21:52,871
National integration.

393
00:21:53,256 --> 00:21:55,315
Even the sensor shall be happy.

394
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:57,120
Come on!

395
00:21:57,825 --> 00:21:59,847
There... So we are done.

396
00:21:59,969 --> 00:22:06,412
Partner, your talent and my police brains
shall make a name in the film industry.

397
00:22:06,712 --> 00:22:07,758
That's right!

398
00:22:07,838 --> 00:22:10,474
You think of the story, whole night.
- Okay!

399
00:22:10,667 --> 00:22:13,008
I shall come tomorrow to
Ameenabai's place. Okay? - Okay!

400
00:22:13,088 --> 00:22:15,332
You have to go to Ameenabai house.
I have to go that way.

401
00:22:15,822 --> 00:22:17,422
Okay! I shall come tomorrow. Okay?
- Okay!

402
00:22:17,567 --> 00:22:19,883
What a team! Dawood, Pandya.

403
00:22:20,048 --> 00:22:22,987
Dawood, Pandya. National integration.

404
00:22:23,157 --> 00:22:25,731
Wow! Dawood, Pandya.

405
00:23:30,885 --> 00:23:32,067
Great god!

406
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:42,790
Listen! Listen!

407
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:46,783
Look! It's morning, wake you!

408
00:23:50,968 --> 00:23:53,654
Listen! Listen!

409
00:23:57,434 --> 00:24:00,565
Oh god! You can't awaken a girl?

410
00:24:09,494 --> 00:24:10,912
No! No!
- Who are you?

411
00:24:11,205 --> 00:24:12,748
I am nobody.

412
00:24:13,393 --> 00:24:15,663
Yesterday night, that...

413
00:24:15,743 --> 00:24:17,292
Raheem had come to leave you.

414
00:24:17,657 --> 00:24:18,986
Wake up! He'll be coming soon.

415
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:23,869
I am going to the bathroom.
And you please...Okay?

416
00:24:33,659 --> 00:24:34,905
Might be Raheem.

417
00:24:39,598 --> 00:24:40,730
Greetings, sister in law!

418
00:24:41,227 --> 00:24:44,639
I am constable Pandya,
the partner of Dawood, the story man.

419
00:24:45,102 --> 00:24:46,348
We've formed a team.

420
00:24:46,721 --> 00:24:49,606
These days no one gets a
job in the movies without a team.

421
00:24:50,244 --> 00:24:54,505
Yesterday night I had told my partner
that I have a story in my brain.

422
00:24:54,906 --> 00:24:56,098
You might not know.

423
00:24:56,261 --> 00:24:58,944
There's a goon here who
was caught yesterday night.

424
00:24:59,342 --> 00:25:00,427
Raheem, the goon.

425
00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:03,140
Got caught?
- Yes.

426
00:25:03,455 --> 00:25:06,973
And I made a story on the same idea.

427
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:09,223
Well! Where is brother Dawood?

428
00:25:09,765 --> 00:25:11,765
He's bathing.

429
00:25:11,904 --> 00:25:14,765
No problem! Let him get ready.
I shall wait outside.

430
00:25:14,848 --> 00:25:16,140
No problem!

431
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:17,765
Has Raheem come?

432
00:25:18,299 --> 00:25:22,932
No! It is some constable.
Says, Rahim got caught in the night.

433
00:25:23,434 --> 00:25:24,518
What?

434
00:25:24,833 --> 00:25:26,383
Greetings, mother!
- Be blessed, son.

435
00:25:27,126 --> 00:25:28,158
Okay, thanks!

436
00:25:33,712 --> 00:25:36,140
Are you here to meet Dawood?

437
00:25:36,466 --> 00:25:37,393
Yes, madam!

438
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:39,085
I am Dawood's partner.

439
00:25:39,557 --> 00:25:42,738
We'll be forming a writer's team.
Dawood-Pandya.

440
00:25:42,858 --> 00:25:45,223
Okay! Dawood knows that you've come,
isn't it?

441
00:25:46,149 --> 00:25:49,256
I told sister in law.
- Sister in law?

442
00:25:49,718 --> 00:25:51,308
Yes, Dawood's wife! His wife!

443
00:25:51,654 --> 00:25:52,635
Wife!

444
00:25:53,204 --> 00:25:54,450
What?
- Inside!

445
00:25:55,399 --> 00:25:56,461
Dawood!

446
00:26:02,986 --> 00:26:04,678
Leave this marriage thing to me.

447
00:26:05,249 --> 00:26:08,782
One day I'll get you such
a daughter in law, you'll be amazed.

448
00:26:08,928 --> 00:26:12,295
Did you see anyone?
- I did see. But, haven't kept.

449
00:26:21,271 --> 00:26:24,145
Truly he had said,
"you'll be amazed."

450
00:26:25,514 --> 00:26:26,599
Dawood!

451
00:26:28,807 --> 00:26:30,726
Yes, mother!
- Son of as mother!

452
00:26:30,925 --> 00:26:32,497
You dare this? You had no shame?

453
00:26:32,713 --> 00:26:33,809
What could I do, mother?

454
00:26:34,162 --> 00:26:35,132
Lying to me?

455
00:26:35,391 --> 00:26:38,209
I did see. But, haven't kept.
- Haven't kept, this.

456
00:26:38,994 --> 00:26:41,894
You brought my daughter in law,
hiding, like this?

457
00:26:41,974 --> 00:26:43,206
Daughter in law?
- What else?

458
00:26:43,321 --> 00:26:43,674
Oh no!

459
00:26:43,754 --> 00:26:47,550
Neither did someone do the tradition,
nor anything else, no celebration.

460
00:26:47,659 --> 00:26:48,867
Have you no shame?
- Let me tell you...

461
00:26:49,044 --> 00:26:50,659
Please understand me!
The thing is that...

462
00:26:50,742 --> 00:26:52,159
What should I understand?

463
00:26:52,329 --> 00:26:55,200
You shall make me understand everything
because I am younger to you.

464
00:26:55,284 --> 00:26:57,117
That's not so, mother!
- Let me go!

465
00:26:57,225 --> 00:26:59,745
Move away!
- What are you doing mother?

466
00:26:59,825 --> 00:27:04,409
Come here! Come here,
look who has come. Listen! Listen!

467
00:27:04,492 --> 00:27:07,409
What's happened? What's happened?

468
00:27:07,492 --> 00:27:09,325
Have a look! Have a look!

469
00:27:09,492 --> 00:27:12,034
What a moon-like bride
Dawood has brought!

470
00:27:12,231 --> 00:27:14,617
So the good news was
about the moon-like bride?

471
00:27:14,909 --> 00:27:21,325
"Her hands are colored,
someone please come and take the veil up."

472
00:27:21,685 --> 00:27:25,742
"Someone please come
and take the veil up."

473
00:27:30,409 --> 00:27:36,575
"Her hands are colored,
someone please come and take the veil up."

474
00:27:36,916 --> 00:27:41,034
"Someone please come
and take the veil up."

475
00:27:43,873 --> 00:27:46,677
Mother, where are you taking?
- You come on!

476
00:27:47,133 --> 00:27:48,249
See for yourself!

477
00:27:55,585 --> 00:27:57,297
Where are you taking, inside?
- Be quite!

478
00:28:09,441 --> 00:28:11,543
May god give you'll a long married life.

479
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,055
Today, you have fulfilled that wish...

480
00:28:14,826 --> 00:28:16,186
...of mine which would
have never got fulfilled.

481
00:28:17,915 --> 00:28:21,405
It was my desire to see my Wahid's
daughter in law come in this room.

482
00:28:22,519 --> 00:28:25,992
I made and decorated this
room with so much expectation.

483
00:28:26,977 --> 00:28:28,474
But when the marriage day neared..

484
00:28:29,755 --> 00:28:33,461
..without even telling
me my Wahid passed away.

485
00:28:35,018 --> 00:28:37,799
Since then locked his room.

486
00:28:38,769 --> 00:28:41,317
Today, I've opened it after 12 years.

487
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:43,277
Come!

488
00:28:47,227 --> 00:28:49,144
Do meet the expectations of this room!

489
00:28:49,275 --> 00:28:50,644
What's the need for all this, mother?

490
00:28:51,394 --> 00:28:52,680
There is need!

491
00:29:02,402 --> 00:29:04,639
This idiot Raheem was
to be arrested today only?

492
00:29:04,869 --> 00:29:06,126
What trouble is this?

493
00:29:06,351 --> 00:29:08,064
It's a crooked job to be a bride.

494
00:29:08,475 --> 00:29:10,351
My neck is paining,
bending all the time.

495
00:29:10,562 --> 00:29:12,935
You hang your neck on that chair
and sleep on the bed.

496
00:29:13,648 --> 00:29:14,849
I shall sleep here!

497
00:29:15,913 --> 00:29:17,443
Forget sleeping,
I shall not even touch this bed.

498
00:29:18,024 --> 00:29:19,122
Why?

499
00:29:20,239 --> 00:29:21,288
I'll be burned.

500
00:29:22,114 --> 00:29:23,108
Be burned?

501
00:29:24,248 --> 00:29:31,107
Mr. Dawood, this bed is for
the marriage night, for a bride.

502
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:33,989
I am not a bride.

503
00:29:36,698 --> 00:29:37,735
I am a courtesan!

504
00:29:39,473 --> 00:29:42,072
A courtesan?

505
00:29:44,243 --> 00:29:49,599
Now you might ask...even I ask...

506
00:29:51,236 --> 00:29:54,947
..."how did I leave the court
and reach this room?"

507
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,268
Don't know if this room
is the result of story.

508
00:30:01,632 --> 00:30:02,627
Or, past.

509
00:30:04,067 --> 00:30:07,322
But still,
I surely know the end of this story.

510
00:30:08,992 --> 00:30:10,375
This is not some
two or four years ago.

511
00:30:11,594 --> 00:30:12,865
It's many, many years ago.

512
00:30:15,191 --> 00:30:17,775
The moon was peeping
through the door of my room.

513
00:30:20,027 --> 00:30:22,630
And I was dancing with
a thousand anklet on my feet.

514
00:30:44,409 --> 00:30:47,374
"A precious devotee."

515
00:30:47,594 --> 00:30:50,557
"A precious devotee."

516
00:30:50,718 --> 00:30:53,760
"A precious devotee."

517
00:30:53,843 --> 00:30:56,802
"A precious devotee."

518
00:30:56,927 --> 00:31:03,218
"Coming to the market, losing
the flowers, was sold off priceless."

519
00:31:03,302 --> 00:31:06,468
"A precious devotee."

520
00:31:06,552 --> 00:31:10,635
"A precious devotee."

521
00:31:54,885 --> 00:32:01,802
"Young age, plain mantlet,
cruel dance."

522
00:32:04,552 --> 00:32:10,135
"Young age, plain mantlet,
cruel dance."

523
00:32:10,885 --> 00:32:16,093
"There's scrambling in the town of beauty,
everything is sold away."

524
00:32:16,177 --> 00:32:19,343
"You too bargain, my dear."

525
00:32:19,427 --> 00:32:22,593
"You too bargain, my dear."

526
00:32:22,677 --> 00:32:25,760
"You too bargain, my dear."

527
00:32:25,843 --> 00:32:28,927
"You too bargain, my dear."

528
00:32:29,010 --> 00:32:35,385
"Coming to the market, losing
the flowers, was sold off priceless."

529
00:32:35,468 --> 00:32:38,635
"A precious devotee."

530
00:32:38,718 --> 00:32:42,468
"A precious devotee."

531
00:33:16,507 --> 00:33:23,093
"Wearing the flowers, the hands
coloured, was seated all dressed up."

532
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:32,135
"Wearing the flowers, the hands
coloured, was seated all dressed up."

533
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:38,010
"I am not wedded this night,
yet I am wedded."

534
00:33:38,093 --> 00:33:41,260
"You too say something, dear."

535
00:33:41,343 --> 00:33:44,510
"You too say something, dear."

536
00:33:44,593 --> 00:33:47,722
"You too say something, dear."

537
00:33:47,802 --> 00:33:50,885
"You too say something, dear."

538
00:33:50,968 --> 00:33:57,302
"Coming to the market, losing
the flowers, was sold off priceless."

539
00:33:57,385 --> 00:34:00,552
"A precious devotee."

540
00:34:00,635 --> 00:34:03,680
"A precious devotee."

541
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:06,802
"A precious devotee."

542
00:34:06,885 --> 00:34:09,927
"A precious devotee."

543
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:12,927
"A precious devotee."

544
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:16,552
"A precious devotee."

545
00:34:16,635 --> 00:34:18,093
Fantastic! Fantastic!

546
00:34:18,177 --> 00:34:19,843
Very nice! Very nice!

547
00:34:19,927 --> 00:34:21,468
Madam, that was fantastic!

548
00:34:21,552 --> 00:34:23,968
Fantastic! Fantastic!

549
00:34:24,052 --> 00:34:26,135
Fantastic! Fantastic!

550
00:34:27,449 --> 00:34:28,968
Do have your say, Rahim!

551
00:34:29,227 --> 00:34:31,135
Madam Bilkis, what's there to say?

552
00:34:31,294 --> 00:34:32,802
My face has become colourless.

553
00:34:33,102 --> 00:34:34,552
What a girl you've readied!

554
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:38,343
Talk about the matter!
- What matter?

555
00:34:38,677 --> 00:34:41,552
I had given you 2000 before,
here is another 2000.

556
00:34:41,635 --> 00:34:42,718
The remaining 6000 later!

557
00:34:42,904 --> 00:34:46,302
What the hell!
Away with this 2000 rupees!

558
00:34:46,677 --> 00:34:51,218
In this ten years, the price of ladyfinger
has risen from 75 paisa to 7 rupees.

559
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:54,760
And my Sultana's
rates remain the same?

560
00:34:55,222 --> 00:34:57,135
Even her nails won't come for 10,000.

561
00:34:57,611 --> 00:34:59,177
Spending time is a far away thing.

562
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:01,385
You are cheating, Bilkis madam!

563
00:35:01,553 --> 00:35:02,472
It's cruelty!

564
00:35:02,645 --> 00:35:04,802
If you say,
I shall give you back the 2000 also.

565
00:35:05,343 --> 00:35:07,802
Sultana is worth 50,000 now.

566
00:35:07,885 --> 00:35:11,135
If you want you take 1 lakh,
but take this 2000 now.

567
00:35:11,325 --> 00:35:12,135
Come on take!

568
00:35:12,623 --> 00:35:14,700
Let the girl reach Bombay just once.

569
00:35:15,033 --> 00:35:18,033
Then you see, this girl will
become a printing press for money.

570
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:20,117
I was sold off to Rahim.

571
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:23,340
And he brought me to Bombay
to do business with my body.

572
00:35:23,862 --> 00:35:25,035
And my virginity was traded.

573
00:35:26,077 --> 00:35:27,058
Sir, the police!

574
00:35:27,138 --> 00:35:29,494
But before the auction was complete,

575
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,138
There was a police raid.

576
00:35:31,597 --> 00:35:33,114
There was total chaos.

577
00:35:33,468 --> 00:35:35,647
Rahim took me from the
back stairs and ran away.

578
00:35:37,998 --> 00:35:42,019
And I came out of my
story to be in your story.

579
00:35:44,192 --> 00:35:46,247
Hope you've got the
answer to your question.

580
00:35:47,414 --> 00:35:49,237
As to how this courtesan
reached this room.

581
00:35:50,723 --> 00:35:54,649
In which, Ameena madams affection is
spread like the mats for Namaz (prayer).

582
00:35:56,096 --> 00:35:57,739
But, now answer this question!

583
00:35:58,582 --> 00:36:00,933
How did I get shut behind
this door with a courtesan?

584
00:36:01,447 --> 00:36:04,849
Coincidence,
bad luck, whatever you may say.

585
00:36:06,766 --> 00:36:10,642
But I will have to face this Coincidence,
bad luck even after you go.

586
00:36:11,447 --> 00:36:12,573
What will I tell people?

587
00:36:12,874 --> 00:36:14,823
Say that there was a telegram.

588
00:36:15,253 --> 00:36:17,364
I had to go to my house.
- Then?

589
00:36:18,107 --> 00:36:22,531
Then say that she was unable
to bear the happiness of marriage.

590
00:36:23,573 --> 00:36:24,783
She died!

591
00:36:42,648 --> 00:36:44,319
Are you ready?
- Yes.

592
00:36:47,286 --> 00:36:52,111
Before the neighbours wake up,
we should reach the station.

593
00:36:53,028 --> 00:36:54,903
So that we can inquire
about your transportation.

594
00:36:56,854 --> 00:36:59,694
Keep this!
- What's this?

595
00:37:00,361 --> 00:37:01,736
Got it yesterday at the ceremony.

596
00:37:02,444 --> 00:37:04,319
You got it, so you keep it.
Why give me?

597
00:37:05,486 --> 00:37:08,819
We are not fortunate
to have these ceremonies, sir.

598
00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:12,153
This got it for your bride.

599
00:37:12,876 --> 00:37:14,137
Keep it!

600
00:37:14,778 --> 00:37:18,778
When your bride comes,
give it on my behalf.

601
00:37:20,278 --> 00:37:22,653
No! You keep it!

602
00:37:23,153 --> 00:37:25,653
Will come useful during journey.
- Thank you!

603
00:37:27,944 --> 00:37:29,194
Listen!
- Yes.

604
00:37:30,042 --> 00:37:32,444
Not from here. We'll go from backdoor.

605
00:37:33,447 --> 00:37:34,653
If someone sees us...

606
00:37:37,663 --> 00:37:39,403
Thank you for your generosity!

607
00:37:39,861 --> 00:37:40,903
What generosity?

608
00:37:42,095 --> 00:37:45,903
First time I know that,
there are humans too in this world.

609
00:37:47,652 --> 00:37:50,903
Else, a courtesan is
just a doll for a night.

610
00:37:59,419 --> 00:38:01,486
Greetings Dawood sir!

611
00:38:01,749 --> 00:38:03,717
Trying to sneak away silently or what?

612
00:38:06,965 --> 00:38:08,132
Who are you'll?

613
00:38:08,212 --> 00:38:11,837
Rahim has sent us.
- Okay! Okay!

614
00:38:12,018 --> 00:38:13,531
Take her, surely!
- No!

615
00:38:14,809 --> 00:38:16,913
Rahim has said that the
girl will stay here only.

616
00:38:17,412 --> 00:38:18,405
Stay here only?
- Yes!

617
00:38:18,485 --> 00:38:19,771
Why will she stay here?

618
00:38:19,851 --> 00:38:21,926
Are you out of your mind or what?

619
00:38:22,441 --> 00:38:26,968
Nobody questions Rahim, here,
in Bombay. Understood?

620
00:38:27,048 --> 00:38:29,337
That's okay!
- Once said is said!

621
00:38:30,258 --> 00:38:34,462
Till the time Rahim does not come out
of the jail, Sultana will stay here.

622
00:38:36,599 --> 00:38:39,201
Here is the trunk. And your keys.

623
00:38:39,766 --> 00:38:40,875
Good bye!

624
00:38:45,057 --> 00:38:46,628
This...this...
- Listen!

625
00:38:47,342 --> 00:38:48,634
Seen this knife?

626
00:38:49,134 --> 00:38:52,217
If you try to escape, you're finished.

627
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:55,009
You too listen to this man!

628
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:57,550
Now this girl is your life.

629
00:38:58,009 --> 00:38:59,759
If she's not there,
you too are not there.

630
00:38:59,966 --> 00:39:00,925
Understood?

631
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,697
Did you hear this, Dawood?

632
00:39:09,114 --> 00:39:11,325
Dawood is lost in deep thoughts,
Mr. Lala.

633
00:39:11,405 --> 00:39:12,614
You better tell us!

634
00:39:13,239 --> 00:39:16,614
Ladies, this is for men.

635
00:39:17,155 --> 00:39:18,572
Yes, listen!

636
00:39:19,405 --> 00:39:21,489
The police raided Babu Kantidas...

637
00:39:21,572 --> 00:39:25,697
... house in Bandra east
and found out his four wives.

638
00:39:25,902 --> 00:39:27,072
Forget it, Mr. Lala!

639
00:39:27,155 --> 00:39:30,030
Can four wives be found
in the house of a Hindu?

640
00:39:30,114 --> 00:39:31,072
That's right!

641
00:39:31,447 --> 00:39:35,697
When the police asked this, he said his
real name was Abdul Rashid Farooqi.

642
00:39:35,864 --> 00:39:38,364
Okay! - Kantidas is a filmy name.
- Oh!

643
00:39:38,492 --> 00:39:41,534
Later it was known that
it was not his wives at all.

644
00:39:41,614 --> 00:39:43,206
Then?
- They were courtesans.

645
00:39:44,247 --> 00:39:47,280
This person was running
a business in his house.

646
00:39:47,749 --> 00:39:49,364
Courtesans at home? Oh god!

647
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:52,078
What's the matter man?

648
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:55,364
You are scared as if
your secret has been opened.

649
00:39:58,050 --> 00:39:59,030
What's the matter, Brother Dawood?

650
00:39:59,371 --> 00:40:00,546
Seem very disturbed.

651
00:40:00,626 --> 00:40:03,114
Are you keeping fine?
- Yes. Yes.

652
00:40:05,769 --> 00:40:07,499
Latif, where is Mr. Dawood?

653
00:40:07,579 --> 00:40:08,750
There he comes!

654
00:40:09,458 --> 00:40:10,417
Hey Dawood!

655
00:40:12,861 --> 00:40:14,542
Dawood!
- Yes sir.

656
00:40:14,753 --> 00:40:16,667
Did you read the
manuscript of Kainat Mirza?

657
00:40:16,991 --> 00:40:19,417
I've read a little,
some of it is remaining.

658
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,583
How is the start?

659
00:40:21,099 --> 00:40:22,167
It's got a cyclonic start.

660
00:40:22,247 --> 00:40:24,628
Then it should have a good end too.
- I think so.

661
00:40:24,708 --> 00:40:26,625
Do read it soon, please!
- Yes sir.

662
00:40:27,284 --> 00:40:29,625
Well! What is the Title of the novel?

663
00:40:30,149 --> 00:40:31,340
'Tawaif'.

664
00:40:41,263 --> 00:40:44,316
Sister in law, open the door!

665
00:40:50,292 --> 00:40:51,728
Was shouting since long.

666
00:40:51,874 --> 00:40:53,738
What was our sister in law doing?

667
00:40:53,818 --> 00:40:56,030
Was doing prayers.
- Wow!

668
00:40:56,110 --> 00:40:57,440
You'll learn something.

669
00:40:58,008 --> 00:40:59,189
You'll too start doing prayers.

670
00:40:59,846 --> 00:41:01,772
Greetings!
- be blessed!

671
00:41:02,138 --> 00:41:03,606
Do you read 5 times?

672
00:41:04,073 --> 00:41:05,397
Well, I do read.

673
00:41:05,564 --> 00:41:07,356
Oh god! Saw that?

674
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,106
What's happening?

675
00:41:09,891 --> 00:41:10,939
Greetings!
- Be blessed!

676
00:41:11,019 --> 00:41:13,772
Do you know, our bride prays 5 times?

677
00:41:13,856 --> 00:41:18,189
Fantastic!
I wish our daughter too was like you.

678
00:41:19,144 --> 00:41:21,606
Nadira is, by god's grace, so sweet.

679
00:41:22,008 --> 00:41:23,689
Sister in law, come for meal, please!

680
00:41:23,823 --> 00:41:24,856
Will he not come for the meal?

681
00:41:24,936 --> 00:41:26,522
He'll eat the thorns. Go!

682
00:41:26,668 --> 00:41:29,106
Come on! Come on!
- Take her. The meal is getting cold.

683
00:41:30,105 --> 00:41:31,147
Saw that sister?

684
00:41:31,576 --> 00:41:33,564
Such a nice bride in these times.

685
00:41:33,644 --> 00:41:34,897
Dawood is a lucky person.

686
00:41:36,082 --> 00:41:37,975
Should I tell Kainat about Sultana?

687
00:41:38,538 --> 00:41:39,663
She might find a solution.

688
00:41:40,668 --> 00:41:43,658
No! The matter might
get out of hands too.

689
00:41:44,181 --> 00:41:45,720
Possible that Kainat
might misunderstand.

690
00:41:45,803 --> 00:41:46,723
What's the matter?

691
00:41:46,803 --> 00:41:47,803
You are very silent.

692
00:41:48,236 --> 00:41:50,386
No! Nothing as such.

693
00:41:50,761 --> 00:41:52,178
Then, do talk something.

694
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:53,390
What to talk?

695
00:41:53,470 --> 00:41:56,220
Something that happened today,
something that happened yesterday.

696
00:41:56,595 --> 00:41:57,636
Take!
- Thank you!

697
00:41:58,898 --> 00:42:05,720
Kainat, some problems
in life cannot be shared.

698
00:42:06,452 --> 00:42:07,590
Example?

699
00:42:08,062 --> 00:42:11,684
You take the example of my life.

700
00:42:12,322 --> 00:42:14,934
Such a thing has happened
which I can neither tell you...

701
00:42:15,643 --> 00:42:18,226
...nor can I get out from it.
- Then?

702
00:42:19,559 --> 00:42:21,976
What then? Up to god!

703
00:42:24,085 --> 00:42:26,342
Can I help?

704
00:42:29,751 --> 00:42:33,300
Yes. Just keep smiling like this!

705
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:36,009
Will the problems be over with it?

706
00:42:36,217 --> 00:42:38,009
At least I can forget
it for some time.

707
00:42:38,342 --> 00:42:41,092
Will you'll keep talking
only or have food also?

708
00:42:41,622 --> 00:42:43,411
This can get cold too.

709
00:42:43,913 --> 00:42:45,228
Come on sit!

710
00:42:46,865 --> 00:42:49,786
This is the problem
about you educated people.

711
00:42:50,071 --> 00:42:51,077
You'll talk a lot.

712
00:42:51,902 --> 00:42:55,911
This my girl is very boring.
- Mother!

713
00:42:56,163 --> 00:42:58,077
Come on, eat, son!

714
00:43:04,444 --> 00:43:06,636
Okay, then good bye!

715
00:43:06,934 --> 00:43:08,105
God is always there!

716
00:43:09,882 --> 00:43:13,036
If you don't wish to tell
your problems then don't tell!

717
00:43:13,706 --> 00:43:15,794
But keep this holy necklace with you!

718
00:43:16,281 --> 00:43:18,121
BY god's grace your
problems will be solved.

719
00:43:19,211 --> 00:43:20,322
Take it!

720
00:43:27,591 --> 00:43:31,222
Dawood's alarm has gone off,
to sleep, and he has not yet come.

721
00:43:35,622 --> 00:43:37,282
I'm very hungry!

722
00:43:46,534 --> 00:43:48,034
Good thing that you are eating!

723
00:43:48,492 --> 00:43:51,217
Mother, I was testing the salt.

724
00:43:51,701 --> 00:43:53,202
I tell you, "you have your meal."

725
00:43:54,367 --> 00:43:55,659
How can I eat without him?

726
00:43:55,742 --> 00:43:57,909
He hasn't yet come. Isn't it?

727
00:43:58,107 --> 00:43:59,409
Let him come, I'll show him.

728
00:43:59,679 --> 00:44:01,492
He's not bothered about
the daughter in law.

729
00:44:03,043 --> 00:44:05,999
Listen to Ameena madam
and have the meal.

730
00:44:06,275 --> 00:44:07,193
Come on, eat your meal!

731
00:44:16,579 --> 00:44:18,685
Oh no! The same problem, again.

732
00:44:20,091 --> 00:44:21,532
God save me!

733
00:44:31,882 --> 00:44:33,900
Please come, Mr. Dawood! Come!

734
00:44:34,435 --> 00:44:35,603
Food is ready!

735
00:44:36,706 --> 00:44:38,382
You eat! I've already eaten.

736
00:44:39,330 --> 00:44:41,455
If I were your real wife,
I'd break your head.

737
00:44:42,497 --> 00:44:44,872
Because I'm a courtesan,
I'm being modest.

738
00:44:45,997 --> 00:44:47,539
With whom did you have your meal with?

739
00:44:48,205 --> 00:44:50,080
Is there any girl or what?

740
00:44:51,383 --> 00:44:54,830
Since you are late,
there should be a girl.

741
00:44:55,330 --> 00:44:56,997
What say? Isn't it?

742
00:44:57,580 --> 00:44:58,955
Okay! Leave this dress!

743
00:45:01,539 --> 00:45:05,622
Do eat something from my hand.

744
00:45:06,997 --> 00:45:08,414
Strange!

745
00:45:23,494 --> 00:45:24,582
Where are you going?

746
00:45:25,075 --> 00:45:27,247
You change your dress,
I'll go for a walk and come.

747
00:45:27,330 --> 00:45:29,117
There is no need for the husband to...

748
00:45:30,043 --> 00:45:32,170
...go out when the wife
is changing her dress.

749
00:45:33,570 --> 00:45:35,667
Sometimes she, herself, undresses him.

750
00:45:35,747 --> 00:45:37,894
Please don't talk to me like this!

751
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:39,289
Come on man!

752
00:45:39,596 --> 00:45:41,955
I am making you practice
being a husband, for free.

753
00:45:42,297 --> 00:45:44,497
You are very naughty!

754
00:45:45,061 --> 00:45:46,187
You are very naughty!

755
00:45:46,789 --> 00:45:49,539
Listen Mr. Dawood Khan Yusuf Zaid!

756
00:45:50,993 --> 00:45:53,118
Neither have you called me here...

757
00:45:53,701 --> 00:45:55,409
...nor have I come here, by myself.

758
00:45:57,159 --> 00:45:59,701
Both are here because
of the fear of Rahim.

759
00:46:00,159 --> 00:46:01,659
Destiny is to be blamed.

760
00:46:02,076 --> 00:46:03,326
Why should we both fight?

761
00:46:05,618 --> 00:46:07,534
This moment can be spent laughing too.

762
00:46:07,618 --> 00:46:09,618
For god's sake, don't trouble me!

763
00:46:09,701 --> 00:46:10,816
Please, for god's sake!

764
00:46:11,576 --> 00:46:13,618
Now go to the bathroom
and change the dress!

765
00:46:14,034 --> 00:46:16,534
Come on, go there, now!
- Going!

766
00:46:18,243 --> 00:46:21,243
God, where have you put me,
with this problem?

767
00:46:40,119 --> 00:46:41,536
Why this theatre partition?

768
00:46:41,953 --> 00:46:43,244
Are you doing some drama or what?

769
00:46:44,203 --> 00:46:45,661
You won't understand this.

770
00:46:46,203 --> 00:46:48,786
I am dividing this room
into 2 parts with this curtain.

771
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:50,911
You shall be sleeping
on this side of the curtain.

772
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:52,328
And I shall be sleeping
on the other side.

773
00:46:52,494 --> 00:46:53,458
Understood?

774
00:46:53,703 --> 00:46:55,994
Really foolish!
- Why?

775
00:46:56,703 --> 00:47:00,703
People go to a courtesan
leaving their house, family etc.

776
00:47:01,619 --> 00:47:02,635
Look at you!

777
00:47:02,796 --> 00:47:07,661
The courtesan has come to your house
and you are showing your decency.

778
00:47:08,158 --> 00:47:11,328
Look! Listen to me
and go sleep on that cot!

779
00:47:11,949 --> 00:47:18,703
Neither am I habituated of
sleeping alone, and neither education.

780
00:47:19,618 --> 00:47:22,618
I am not able to sleep!

781
00:47:22,909 --> 00:47:24,159
As it is I won't be able to sleep!

782
00:47:24,826 --> 00:47:26,701
You have taken away
the peace from this house.

783
00:47:26,784 --> 00:47:29,826
Go away! I have put life into this.

784
00:47:30,159 --> 00:47:31,993
Else, what was there in your life?

785
00:47:32,476 --> 00:47:35,284
Ameenabai? At the most, Nadira.

786
00:47:35,868 --> 00:47:36,861
Talking!

787
00:47:36,941 --> 00:47:39,534
Look! Sultana,
there's a limit to misbehaviour.

788
00:47:41,114 --> 00:47:42,493
A forceful guest.

789
00:47:42,743 --> 00:47:44,201
Add to that, arrogance?

790
00:47:44,784 --> 00:47:47,659
I haven't yet got forceful, dear.

791
00:47:54,714 --> 00:47:56,673
Oh god, where have got stuck up?

792
00:47:57,013 --> 00:47:59,839
Really, a very ill-mannered girl.
No shame. Doesn't care for anything.

793
00:47:59,923 --> 00:48:01,423
There is a limit to misbehaviour.

794
00:48:01,631 --> 00:48:02,674
Stupid!

795
00:48:04,089 --> 00:48:05,156
What do I do?

796
00:48:05,927 --> 00:48:07,214
God, what do I do?

797
00:48:09,256 --> 00:48:10,435
Who, Rahim?

798
00:48:10,781 --> 00:48:12,381
Not getting sleep, isn't it?

799
00:48:12,771 --> 00:48:15,131
How will I get sleep
when you are here?

800
00:48:15,298 --> 00:48:17,548
Yes, how will?

801
00:48:18,036 --> 00:48:20,673
The youthfulness is
creating havoc from within.

802
00:48:20,923 --> 00:48:25,464
For god's sake,
please go away from here!

803
00:48:26,589 --> 00:48:27,964
God!

804
00:48:44,381 --> 00:48:45,423
What are you thinking?

805
00:48:47,048 --> 00:48:50,256
I am thinking, "how many years of...

806
00:48:50,339 --> 00:48:53,506
...punishment will I get
if I murder someone?"

807
00:48:53,688 --> 00:49:02,631
Lies! You are thinking of
that girl with whom you had dinner.

808
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:05,339
Lie down and think.

809
00:49:06,381 --> 00:49:08,006
Good night!

810
00:49:15,234 --> 00:49:18,089
Give me the eggs please!

811
00:49:29,061 --> 00:49:32,728
Mr. Dawood! Mr. Dawood!
- Yes.

812
00:49:32,936 --> 00:49:34,311
Here's the tea!

813
00:49:42,459 --> 00:49:44,668
I was dreaming about you.

814
00:49:45,275 --> 00:49:47,275
Is it?
- Oh no!

815
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:49,567
Come on, wake up! Have your tea.

816
00:49:49,650 --> 00:49:51,775
Look! Don't touch me. Okay?

817
00:49:52,725 --> 00:49:58,317
So, I should touch. But not like this.

818
00:49:59,018 --> 00:50:01,858
So, here's the lovely touch.
- Oh god!

819
00:50:05,165 --> 00:50:06,269
That's mother!

820
00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:07,695
It can't be anyone other than mother.

821
00:50:07,912 --> 00:50:10,160
She's right on time,
sharp at 7.30 am, like a clock.

822
00:50:10,284 --> 00:50:11,399
Get up!

823
00:50:14,141 --> 00:50:15,293
Go, open the door!

824
00:50:15,373 --> 00:50:16,834
This pillow.

825
00:50:20,499 --> 00:50:21,624
Greetings, mother!

826
00:50:21,999 --> 00:50:23,249
Greetings, mother!

827
00:50:23,999 --> 00:50:25,040
Be blessed! Be blessed!

828
00:50:31,540 --> 00:50:32,749
Did you'll fight amongst yourselves?

829
00:50:33,874 --> 00:50:34,874
No, mother!

830
00:50:35,790 --> 00:50:37,665
There was extra sugar in the tea.

831
00:50:38,165 --> 00:50:41,749
He was angry at me,
and took out on this cup.

832
00:50:41,832 --> 00:50:43,332
What is this, boy?

833
00:50:43,499 --> 00:50:45,332
Even if you roam about with
the sun on your head...

834
00:50:45,415 --> 00:50:46,499
...you'll not find a girl like her.

835
00:50:47,249 --> 00:50:48,707
Poor girl has come to
Bombay for the first time.

836
00:50:48,915 --> 00:50:50,540
You can't even take her out.

837
00:50:50,624 --> 00:50:52,165
And add to that
you are breaking the cups?

838
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:54,915
Today is a holiday. Go, take her out!

839
00:50:54,999 --> 00:50:57,124
Go!
- He will not take me out, mother.

840
00:50:57,207 --> 00:50:59,249
Why will he not take?
- What's there to see, in Bombay?

841
00:50:59,332 --> 00:51:01,582
'Chor Bazaar',
Gambling, and what else than this?

842
00:51:01,665 --> 00:51:03,999
Is it? Then give me
the rent for 6 months.

843
00:51:04,124 --> 00:51:06,124
And, the 217 rupees credits.

844
00:51:06,582 --> 00:51:08,040
What?
- Yes, give it now!

845
00:51:08,540 --> 00:51:09,582
Okay, I'll take her!

846
00:51:09,999 --> 00:51:11,207
Don't ask for the credit
that you had given me.

847
00:51:23,124 --> 00:51:25,165
Listen! Oh no!

848
00:51:25,332 --> 00:51:26,790
Are we here sightseeing
or a 'Kabaddi' match?

849
00:51:26,874 --> 00:51:28,957
For god's sake be away! Away!
- Why be away?

850
00:51:29,124 --> 00:51:30,120
What if someone sees?

851
00:51:31,464 --> 00:51:34,499
The entire Bombay has come
out to see you only. - Mr. Dawood!

852
00:51:37,115 --> 00:51:38,490
Oh no!
- What happened?

853
00:51:39,199 --> 00:51:40,907
The boss, from our 'Kitab Ghar'.

854
00:51:40,990 --> 00:51:44,324
For god's sake, keep mind your
language, talk respectfully. Okay?

855
00:51:45,462 --> 00:51:46,407
Greetings!

856
00:51:46,490 --> 00:51:48,449
Greetings!
Greetings! So, how's the walk?

857
00:51:48,532 --> 00:51:50,119
Greetings!
- Just like that.

858
00:51:50,199 --> 00:51:51,574
You didn't tell me who this is.

859
00:51:52,077 --> 00:51:54,090
Nigam sir, the thing is...
Actually...

860
00:51:54,170 --> 00:51:58,740
I understood that you have hid the fact
from me that you are a husband too.

861
00:51:59,032 --> 00:52:00,490
And I understood the meaning too.

862
00:52:00,684 --> 00:52:02,532
You are a miser, don't want
to spend on reception. Right?

863
00:52:02,615 --> 00:52:04,324
No! No!
- That's why you didn't tell.

864
00:52:04,605 --> 00:52:06,657
Daughter, what's your name?
- Sultana!

865
00:52:07,017 --> 00:52:08,020
Be blessed, daughter!

866
00:52:08,726 --> 00:52:11,309
He is a miser.
Won't you keep a reception?

867
00:52:11,684 --> 00:52:13,976
The reception shall be as
and when you come.

868
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:15,976
What say?
- Yes! Yes why not?

869
00:52:16,059 --> 00:52:17,144
Be blessed, daughter!

870
00:52:17,559 --> 00:52:20,017
I should be giving the reception.
You are my daughter in law.

871
00:52:20,101 --> 00:52:21,267
I was just joking!

872
00:52:23,809 --> 00:52:26,226
Mr. Dawood!
- Yes, sir! Yes sir!

873
00:52:26,517 --> 00:52:29,517
Congratulation!
I liked your wife very much.

874
00:52:29,601 --> 00:52:32,351
She's beautiful and
also well mannered.

875
00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:35,476
I was...there!
Our group has arrived too.

876
00:52:37,517 --> 00:52:39,017
These are my 4 daughters.

877
00:52:39,252 --> 00:52:41,517
Tina, Meena, Cheena and Beena.

878
00:52:41,985 --> 00:52:43,267
And these are her friends.

879
00:52:43,684 --> 00:52:46,588
And, son,
these are the friends of her friends.

880
00:52:46,668 --> 00:52:48,642
We are here for a picnic.
You too come with us!

881
00:52:48,809 --> 00:52:50,434
No! Sir, we shall leave.
- What no?

882
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:53,174
My wife is coming.
- Listen, wife!

883
00:52:53,335 --> 00:52:55,114
I'll give you a good news.
Come here!

884
00:52:55,358 --> 00:52:57,158
Come fast!
- What's it?

885
00:52:59,662 --> 00:53:00,620
Greetings!

886
00:53:00,953 --> 00:53:02,662
Dawood has got married.

887
00:53:02,828 --> 00:53:03,913
Problem?

888
00:53:05,287 --> 00:53:08,870
Told you so many times not
to eat grams. But do you listen?

889
00:53:08,953 --> 00:53:10,162
You will have problems, of course.
- Yes, yes.

890
00:53:10,328 --> 00:53:12,578
Mother, not problem
but its 'Marriage'.

891
00:53:12,745 --> 00:53:15,662
Marriage?
- Okay! Do get married! Climb the horse.

892
00:53:15,745 --> 00:53:17,745
The children shall
clap from behind you.

893
00:53:17,828 --> 00:53:19,203
Daughter, tell your mother that a...

894
00:53:19,537 --> 00:53:21,870
...bride does not climb
on a horse but a mare.

895
00:53:22,537 --> 00:53:25,370
Father is not talking about his
marriage but... - why are you shouting?

896
00:53:25,453 --> 00:53:27,287
Am I deaf?
- Who said so? Who said?

897
00:53:27,870 --> 00:53:28,537
Dawood!
- Yes.

898
00:53:28,620 --> 00:53:29,623
Who is with you?

899
00:53:29,703 --> 00:53:32,620
That's what I was saying, it's his wife.
Give them blessings, go!

900
00:53:32,703 --> 00:53:33,620
Why didn't you tell before?

901
00:53:33,703 --> 00:53:34,995
My mistake!

902
00:53:35,078 --> 00:53:37,078
Be blessed, daughter.
May 'Allah' give you a son.

903
00:53:37,287 --> 00:53:38,703
Why can't God give, why only 'Allah'?

904
00:53:39,203 --> 00:53:41,537
The thing is that,
Dawood, after marriage she....

905
00:53:41,620 --> 00:53:43,662
...prayed to God for a son.

906
00:53:43,745 --> 00:53:46,662
But all the 4 times,
only daughters were born.

907
00:53:47,078 --> 00:53:50,870
So she is annoyed with god.
And praying to 'Allah'.

908
00:53:51,453 --> 00:53:53,328
Now it will neither
be a son nor a daughter.

909
00:53:54,495 --> 00:53:56,120
Come on, daughter! You come with me.

910
00:53:56,203 --> 00:53:58,162
No! No! Sister in law
will come with us.

911
00:53:58,245 --> 00:53:59,787
I was saying that...

912
00:53:59,870 --> 00:54:01,370
You sit! Be seated!
- You also come!

913
00:54:01,453 --> 00:54:02,245
Come! Come!

914
00:54:02,377 --> 00:54:04,453
Be seated son!
- Be seated!

915
00:54:23,870 --> 00:54:28,912
"We come during the winter."

916
00:54:28,995 --> 00:54:33,787
"We come during the winter."

917
00:54:34,037 --> 00:54:38,787
"Whom do you come
to take during winter."

918
00:54:39,078 --> 00:54:43,870
"We come to take her during winter."

919
00:54:44,162 --> 00:54:48,495
"Whom will you send
to take during winter."

920
00:54:49,203 --> 00:54:54,495
"We'll send him to
take during winter."

921
00:55:05,745 --> 00:55:16,537
"Look, my husband is seated shy,
with his gaze down."

922
00:55:18,532 --> 00:55:27,328
"Look, my husband is seated shy,
with his gaze down."

923
00:55:28,953 --> 00:55:35,162
"Want to say something
but cannot open his mouth."

924
00:55:35,245 --> 00:55:46,037
"Look, my husband is seated shy,
with his gaze down."

925
00:55:49,745 --> 00:56:00,662
"My wife, very cunning, is making
me dance whole day after fooling me."

926
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:02,287
"Oh god."

927
00:56:02,370 --> 00:56:11,703
"My wife, very cunning, is making
me dance whole day after fooling me."

928
00:56:12,995 --> 00:56:18,912
"This is an unnecessary problem
hanging around my neck, god save me."

929
00:56:18,995 --> 00:56:29,745
"My wife, very cunning, is making
me dance whole day after fooling me."

930
00:56:48,953 --> 00:56:53,162
"One day when I was tired,
sleeping in the night."

931
00:56:53,245 --> 00:56:57,287
"I was lost in some sweet dream."

932
00:56:57,370 --> 00:57:01,415
"When there was knock,
I thought it was some guest."

933
00:57:01,495 --> 00:57:05,578
"I never knew that
it was death coming."

934
00:57:05,662 --> 00:57:09,745
"As I opened the door,
it was this innocent face."

935
00:57:09,828 --> 00:57:13,495
"Seeing the house empty
she became my wife forcefully."

936
00:57:17,745 --> 00:57:23,415
"What kind of destiny is this?
Someone please save me."

937
00:57:23,495 --> 00:57:35,120
"My wife, very cunning, is making
me dance whole day after fooling me."

938
00:57:35,828 --> 00:57:44,995
"Look, my husband is seated shy,
with his gaze down."

939
00:58:01,495 --> 00:58:05,370
"Yours was an empty house,
I made it a home."

940
00:58:05,620 --> 00:58:09,662
"I became your wife,
made you a human being."

941
00:58:09,745 --> 00:58:13,912
"I bore all your naggings
yet my lips never complained."

942
00:58:13,995 --> 00:58:18,078
"Like a well-wisher
who has no salary."

943
00:58:18,162 --> 00:58:22,245
"All your problems
will be solved by me."

944
00:58:22,328 --> 00:58:26,078
"You shall have a name
in this world because of me."

945
00:58:30,287 --> 00:58:35,787
"I love him but he scolds me,
he's got no shame."

946
00:58:35,870 --> 00:58:47,162
"Look, my husband is seated shy,
with his gaze down."

947
00:58:48,328 --> 00:58:58,620
"My wife, very cunning, is making
me dance whole day after fooling me."

948
00:58:58,927 --> 00:59:04,745
"This is an unnecessary problem
hanging around my neck, god save me."

949
00:59:04,828 --> 00:59:08,412
"Oh wife, my husband.'

950
00:59:08,495 --> 00:59:12,787
"Oh wife, my husband.'

951
00:59:38,306 --> 00:59:40,639
How was my acting? Good?

952
00:59:42,347 --> 00:59:43,806
To hell with your acting.

953
00:59:45,222 --> 00:59:46,681
I don't know what's
going to happen to me.

954
00:59:48,306 --> 00:59:51,889
The matter is increasing,
and my troubles too are increasing.

955
00:59:53,306 --> 00:59:55,222
The more I try to come out of it..

956
00:59:56,722 --> 00:59:58,181
...the more I am getting stuck in it.

957
00:59:59,542 --> 01:00:03,847
I only know that
I don't wish to put you in trouble.

958
01:00:05,712 --> 01:00:07,139
It's all a game of destiny.

959
01:00:07,584 --> 01:00:10,181
Whose destiny? Mine or yours?

960
01:00:11,317 --> 01:00:12,856
Might be of both.

961
01:00:13,396 --> 01:00:15,306
But one day I will have to go away.

962
01:00:17,279 --> 01:00:19,847
Even if you go away,
my problems will not ease.

963
01:00:20,789 --> 01:00:24,664
Who all will I explain
that you are not part of my life?

964
01:00:25,497 --> 01:00:27,955
You are an incident of my life.

965
01:00:28,861 --> 01:00:31,455
I've become an incident in your life.

966
01:00:33,002 --> 01:00:34,664
But will never become
an unfortunate thing.

967
01:00:36,885 --> 01:00:39,997
I'm a courtesan.
I'm not an ungrateful one.

968
01:00:42,862 --> 01:00:44,414
I'll sleep on the mat today.

969
01:00:46,450 --> 01:00:47,539
Doesn't feel good.

970
01:00:49,721 --> 01:00:52,914
Whoever you are,
you are a guest in this house.

971
01:00:59,747 --> 01:01:01,747
Constable?
- Greetings!

972
01:01:02,884 --> 01:01:05,084
Brother Dawood!
- The morning paper.

973
01:01:05,615 --> 01:01:06,904
Brother Dawood!

974
01:01:09,478 --> 01:01:10,996
Brother Dawood!

975
01:01:17,620 --> 01:01:19,327
Greetings, sister in law!
- Greetings!

976
01:01:20,417 --> 01:01:22,739
Sister in law,
why hand this bed sheet?

977
01:01:24,532 --> 01:01:25,529
Brother Pandya.
- Yes.

978
01:01:25,609 --> 01:01:30,042
We thought this part
should be the bedroom. - Okay!

979
01:01:30,122 --> 01:01:32,927
And that part, the drawing room.

980
01:01:33,549 --> 01:01:36,562
Made the house into a 1 bedroom,
hall flat.

981
01:01:38,631 --> 01:01:40,332
You crack nice jokes.

982
01:01:40,724 --> 01:01:44,223
So, let me have a hot cup of tea.

983
01:01:48,646 --> 01:01:51,521
Hey, partner!
- Welcome Pandya!

984
01:01:51,605 --> 01:01:54,730
Thought of visiting my
partner since I was passing by.

985
01:01:54,813 --> 01:01:58,855
Brother Dawood, hope you haven't
forgotten our partnership thing.

986
01:01:59,646 --> 01:02:00,605
No! I'm no duty!

987
01:02:01,504 --> 01:02:03,473
Remember,
I had told you about the goon Rahim?

988
01:02:03,730 --> 01:02:06,188
On that, I've got an idea.

989
01:02:06,646 --> 01:02:08,938
There was a girl with him, that night.

990
01:02:09,650 --> 01:02:12,021
That girl went missing like magic.

991
01:02:12,443 --> 01:02:16,896
Sister in law, if I find that girl.

992
01:02:17,061 --> 01:02:18,438
Brother Dawood's days shall shine.

993
01:02:18,648 --> 01:02:20,563
Brother Dawood, remember one thing.

994
01:02:20,858 --> 01:02:23,503
We shall not take anything
less than 5.25 lakhs for this story.

995
01:02:23,961 --> 01:02:26,525
Dawood-Pandya,
Salim-Javed, Kalyanji-Anandji.

996
01:02:26,605 --> 01:02:27,855
Mr. Pandey!
- Yes.

997
01:02:28,141 --> 01:02:29,938
I am in a hurry. Need to go to office.
- Okay!

998
01:02:30,493 --> 01:02:32,525
We shall sit and discuss
this story some other time.

999
01:02:32,605 --> 01:02:34,188
Okay! I too shall leave for my work.
- Okay! Go!

1000
01:02:35,036 --> 01:02:36,246
Mr. Dawood!
- take it to Mr. Lalaji!

1001
01:02:36,645 --> 01:02:37,141
Yes, sir.

1002
01:02:37,221 --> 01:02:39,804
I read your note
on Kainat Mirza's novel.

1003
01:02:40,096 --> 01:02:43,471
You have appreciated it so much,
we have to publish the novel.

1004
01:02:44,346 --> 01:02:45,679
Truly?
- Yes.

1005
01:02:46,304 --> 01:02:47,637
Thank you very much, Mr. Suleiman!

1006
01:02:48,221 --> 01:02:49,762
Why are you saying Thank you?

1007
01:02:50,221 --> 01:02:53,096
Mr. Suleiman, you don't know how much
of help you are being to Kainat...

1008
01:02:53,179 --> 01:02:54,429
...by publishing the novel.

1009
01:02:54,804 --> 01:02:58,179
Brother,
troubles are meant to be solved.

1010
01:02:58,785 --> 01:03:00,119
It will be done away with.

1011
01:03:00,910 --> 01:03:02,035
You do one thing.
- Yes sir.

1012
01:03:02,119 --> 01:03:05,077
Tell the printing department
to start the books for the Novel.

1013
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:06,410
Very nice, sir!

1014
01:03:06,619 --> 01:03:09,702
Here is the print order!
- Okay sir!

1015
01:03:10,452 --> 01:03:11,369
Brother Ahmed!

1016
01:03:12,077 --> 01:03:14,285
Has Gulshan Nanda's novel come?

1017
01:03:14,369 --> 01:03:15,869
I'll go and give her the news now.

1018
01:03:16,369 --> 01:03:20,327
Hearing this good news she'll go mad,
Mr. Dawood. Really, mad.

1019
01:03:32,825 --> 01:03:34,427
Greetings!
- Who is it, daughter?

1020
01:03:34,682 --> 01:03:37,369
Mother, its Mr. Suleiman,
the general manager from 'Kitab Ghar'.

1021
01:03:37,740 --> 01:03:39,910
Why are you out? Come inside!

1022
01:03:39,990 --> 01:03:41,106
Come!
- Thank you!

1023
01:03:48,684 --> 01:03:52,451
Since I was passing by,
I thought I'll give you the good news.

1024
01:03:53,928 --> 01:03:56,976
'Kitab Ghar' has decided
to publish your novel.

1025
01:03:58,078 --> 01:04:01,173
Really?
- Thank god, a million times.

1026
01:04:02,145 --> 01:04:07,187
Please accept this grant
on behalf of 'Kitab Ghar'.

1027
01:04:07,604 --> 01:04:08,755
Please take!

1028
01:04:09,229 --> 01:04:10,729
As an advance!

1029
01:04:13,187 --> 01:04:14,645
Three Thousand rupees?

1030
01:04:15,020 --> 01:04:16,020
Such big advance?

1031
01:04:16,520 --> 01:04:18,104
Thank you very much Mr. Suleiman!

1032
01:04:19,062 --> 01:04:22,270
Daughter, do think of it
as: the dry plants getting water.

1033
01:04:23,593 --> 01:04:25,645
Please be seated! I shall get you tea!

1034
01:04:28,334 --> 01:04:29,601
Happy?

1035
01:04:33,610 --> 01:04:35,022
Come!
- Oh god!

1036
01:04:35,102 --> 01:04:36,574
Please be seated with manners.

1037
01:04:36,940 --> 01:04:37,978
The people outside...

1038
01:04:38,645 --> 01:04:40,728
What trouble is this?

1039
01:04:40,927 --> 01:04:43,270
Did you have a fight with someone?

1040
01:04:49,478 --> 01:04:52,224
Who is this Kainat Mirza?
- Why?

1041
01:04:53,795 --> 01:04:54,895
She's a new writer.

1042
01:04:55,096 --> 01:04:56,353
That same girl?

1043
01:04:58,988 --> 01:05:00,812
Is she very beautiful?

1044
01:05:01,809 --> 01:05:02,935
Yes, she is.

1045
01:05:04,253 --> 01:05:05,712
More than me?

1046
01:05:08,577 --> 01:05:10,295
There can be no competition
between a house lamp, and...

1047
01:05:10,378 --> 01:05:11,503
... the lamp in the markets.

1048
01:05:12,210 --> 01:05:14,295
Okay! I am the lamp in the markets.

1049
01:05:16,751 --> 01:05:18,722
But, yet I burn like a lamp.

1050
01:05:27,017 --> 01:05:28,795
Do you love Kainat?

1051
01:05:33,136 --> 01:05:34,305
Don't know!

1052
01:05:34,674 --> 01:05:35,869
I might be.

1053
01:05:36,532 --> 01:05:37,500
Does she love you?

1054
01:05:39,724 --> 01:05:40,837
Don't know this too.

1055
01:05:41,634 --> 01:05:42,628
I think she might be.

1056
01:05:43,911 --> 01:05:45,337
This love of "might be" is not right.

1057
01:05:47,535 --> 01:05:50,878
If you have loved, do express it too.

1058
01:05:53,086 --> 01:05:57,128
Hope someone else
doesn't take it away.

1059
01:05:58,437 --> 01:05:59,979
And you standing holding the heart.

1060
01:06:00,354 --> 01:06:03,146
This is the front cower of your novel,
'Band Darwaza'.

1061
01:06:05,479 --> 01:06:06,771
This is beautiful!

1062
01:06:06,854 --> 01:06:07,771
Is it?
- Yes.

1063
01:06:08,104 --> 01:06:12,357
We need a color photograph
for the back cover.

1064
01:06:12,437 --> 01:06:14,229
My photograph?
- Yes.

1065
01:06:15,442 --> 01:06:16,729
Do send it fast!

1066
01:06:17,897 --> 01:06:19,187
Dawood.
- Yes sir.

1067
01:06:19,354 --> 01:06:20,396
Good I met you.

1068
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:22,792
Wife has made it so difficult.

1069
01:06:23,042 --> 01:06:26,250
Daughters are always
talking about Sultana.

1070
01:06:26,417 --> 01:06:27,502
Come to my place one day.

1071
01:06:28,083 --> 01:06:29,333
Tell me, yes or no!

1072
01:06:30,246 --> 01:06:31,243
Sir! Sir!

1073
01:06:31,875 --> 01:06:33,208
She is Kainat Mirza.

1074
01:06:33,292 --> 01:06:35,333
We are publishing
her book 'Band Darwaza'.

1075
01:06:35,417 --> 01:06:38,709
This Mr. Nigam sir,
the owner of this 'Kitab Ghar'.

1076
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:40,833
Greetings!
- Greetings! Glad to see you!

1077
01:06:40,917 --> 01:06:41,375
Thank you.

1078
01:06:41,458 --> 01:06:42,958
Mr. Suleiman was
appreciating you so much.

1079
01:06:43,042 --> 01:06:44,069
That's his greatness!

1080
01:06:44,478 --> 01:06:47,500
Tomorrow night's meal
is at our place. Okay?

1081
01:06:48,458 --> 01:06:49,667
And, listen!

1082
01:06:50,833 --> 01:06:54,333
Not alone. Do get her also along.
Okay? - Yes, sir! Yes.

1083
01:06:54,833 --> 01:06:56,628
Wow! So many receptions
happening these days.

1084
01:06:56,708 --> 01:06:58,124
Who are you taking along?

1085
01:06:58,416 --> 01:07:01,333
Mr. Nigam was just...was just...

1086
01:07:01,416 --> 01:07:03,083
Then take me along!

1087
01:07:03,374 --> 01:07:05,749
Okay! You come along! Come along!

1088
01:07:05,916 --> 01:07:08,541
I am joking! Why you got so scared?

1089
01:07:08,791 --> 01:07:09,628
Am I scared?
- Yes.

1090
01:07:09,708 --> 01:07:10,374
Where am I scared?

1091
01:07:10,458 --> 01:07:13,916
Why should I be scared?
My face is such.

1092
01:07:15,700 --> 01:07:19,325
Did you call for me?
- Yes, Lala! Be seated!

1093
01:07:20,033 --> 01:07:22,325
Wanted an advice from you.

1094
01:07:22,408 --> 01:07:23,450
Tell me!

1095
01:07:24,408 --> 01:07:27,366
I wish Dawood's salary be increased.

1096
01:07:27,741 --> 01:07:29,200
Suleiman too was appreciating him.

1097
01:07:29,486 --> 01:07:31,950
The boy is very nice.
He's worth. He's M.A pass.

1098
01:07:32,033 --> 01:07:33,325
He should make progress.

1099
01:07:34,226 --> 01:07:36,518
Increase his salary by 300 rupees!

1100
01:07:37,226 --> 01:07:39,727
Your orders!
I shall go and give him the good news.

1101
01:07:39,807 --> 01:07:40,795
Listen, Lala!

1102
01:07:41,472 --> 01:07:42,703
Lala, have you met his wife?

1103
01:07:43,925 --> 01:07:45,175
Is he married?

1104
01:07:45,300 --> 01:07:46,633
Even I did not know.

1105
01:07:46,925 --> 01:07:49,217
But, what a girl.
Very nice from all aspects.

1106
01:07:49,300 --> 01:07:51,300
What we say? Fantastic!

1107
01:07:51,726 --> 01:07:56,262
Seeing here, I thought
that Dawood's salary is less.

1108
01:07:56,342 --> 01:07:57,258
Okay sir!

1109
01:07:57,960 --> 01:07:59,342
Hello, Usman!
- Yes.

1110
01:07:59,556 --> 01:08:02,961
Come here! Fatima, Radheshyam,
Dawood, you also come here!

1111
01:08:03,523 --> 01:08:04,538
All of you come here!

1112
01:08:04,618 --> 01:08:07,076
Congratulate Dawood, please!
- Mr. Lala! - About what?

1113
01:08:07,243 --> 01:08:09,496
This man is so smart.

1114
01:08:09,576 --> 01:08:11,118
It's height of dishonesty.

1115
01:08:11,201 --> 01:08:14,855
He got married and did
not let anyone know of it.

1116
01:08:14,993 --> 01:08:17,493
What is this? We want a party!

1117
01:08:17,576 --> 01:08:19,285
No dinner night.

1118
01:08:19,451 --> 01:08:21,451
We want a reception!

1119
01:08:21,535 --> 01:08:24,410
Yes, yes. We want!
- Okay! Okay!

1120
01:08:25,535 --> 01:08:31,243
I am in such a hurry
that I'm not yet in my sense.

1121
01:08:31,326 --> 01:08:32,660
We don't know. We want party.

1122
01:08:32,743 --> 01:08:34,826
We don't know. We want party.

1123
01:08:34,910 --> 01:08:36,862
There's no escaping this.

1124
01:08:36,942 --> 01:08:37,975
Wait! Wait! Wait!

1125
01:08:38,247 --> 01:08:39,989
There's one more good news.
- What's that?

1126
01:08:40,213 --> 01:08:43,338
Mr. Nigam has increased
his salary by 300 rupees a month.

1127
01:08:43,422 --> 01:08:45,172
Wow! Congratulations!

1128
01:08:46,838 --> 01:08:49,297
Increased by 300 rupees a month.

1129
01:08:49,652 --> 01:08:51,505
The bride is so lucky, isn't it?

1130
01:08:51,588 --> 01:08:53,213
Congratulations!

1131
01:08:53,297 --> 01:08:57,130
There should be a party now! Yes.

1132
01:08:58,755 --> 01:09:00,130
Oh god! What happened?

1133
01:09:00,463 --> 01:09:01,713
My head!

1134
01:09:01,851 --> 01:09:04,672
Dawood will be beaten so
bad that he'll come to his senses.

1135
01:09:04,755 --> 01:09:05,588
What did you do?

1136
01:09:05,702 --> 01:09:08,647
I didn't do. It's you. It's you!
- Where's the water?

1137
01:09:08,727 --> 01:09:11,963
People in the office got to
know about our marriage, you know?

1138
01:09:12,076 --> 01:09:14,463
No water here!
- Then what happened?

1139
01:09:14,547 --> 01:09:17,297
They want a party,
and wish to come here for the meal.

1140
01:09:17,380 --> 01:09:19,547
Let me drink water first.

1141
01:09:19,833 --> 01:09:22,047
So, this is it? You got me scared.

1142
01:09:22,402 --> 01:09:23,963
Let them come, if they want to.

1143
01:09:24,047 --> 01:09:26,797
I say, do call Nigam sir
and his family too.

1144
01:09:26,908 --> 01:09:28,422
So that we'll finish it once for all.

1145
01:09:28,505 --> 01:09:30,963
Yes, you call the entire city.

1146
01:09:31,088 --> 01:09:34,213
You can even call your goon Rahim,
so that it's done, once for all. Okay?

1147
01:09:34,297 --> 01:09:35,474
Talking!

1148
01:09:35,797 --> 01:09:37,297
How will we accommodate
so many people?

1149
01:09:37,380 --> 01:09:39,422
Do you know how much money
will be spent in feeding all of them?

1150
01:09:39,505 --> 01:09:40,505
Yes, I know everything!

1151
01:09:40,588 --> 01:09:42,672
What you know? You know nothing.
- Saying "I know everything."

1152
01:09:42,755 --> 01:09:44,755
God is great! Everything will be fine!

1153
01:09:45,135 --> 01:09:46,713
You call for the party!

1154
01:09:47,211 --> 01:09:48,477
Yes!

1155
01:09:48,958 --> 01:09:50,373
Mr. Dawood!
- Yes, sir!

1156
01:09:52,119 --> 01:09:53,434
When are you inviting for the party?

1157
01:09:55,304 --> 01:09:57,485
I feel, Saturday night will be fine.

1158
01:09:58,405 --> 01:10:02,408
I am more interested in
meeting your wife, than the party.

1159
01:10:03,155 --> 01:10:04,792
Mr. Nigam was so full of praises!

1160
01:10:05,498 --> 01:10:07,289
Just a minute! Come here!
- Yes.

1161
01:10:12,309 --> 01:10:14,891
He has given this
money as advance for you.

1162
01:10:22,088 --> 01:10:23,160
How did I land up in his wrong room?

1163
01:10:23,930 --> 01:10:25,349
Outside...
- Come inside Mr.

1164
01:10:26,588 --> 01:10:27,891
This is your room!

1165
01:10:31,505 --> 01:10:32,924
How did you do all this?

1166
01:10:33,255 --> 01:10:34,464
It's a magic!

1167
01:10:35,492 --> 01:10:39,225
Those people think I'm your wife.

1168
01:10:39,630 --> 01:10:43,213
If I don't serve well,
they'll feel you've ruined your destiny.

1169
01:10:43,660 --> 01:10:47,433
Got such a wife who has not
even arranged for water at home.

1170
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:49,716
Where did you get so much money from?

1171
01:10:50,812 --> 01:10:52,472
I had that money gotten
from the ceremony.

1172
01:10:53,118 --> 01:10:55,704
The other, I had that diamond ring.

1173
01:10:56,441 --> 01:10:59,172
It was not used at your house.
I sold it.

1174
01:10:59,982 --> 01:11:01,999
What if Rahim asks' you about it?

1175
01:11:02,359 --> 01:11:03,713
Did that belong to his father
that he should ask me?

1176
01:11:04,524 --> 01:11:06,953
If he wants he can get a new one made.

1177
01:11:09,968 --> 01:11:12,833
Sultana, what you did is not right.

1178
01:11:14,389 --> 01:11:15,630
At least you should have asked me.

1179
01:11:18,504 --> 01:11:20,734
I did so many things
without asking you.

1180
01:11:22,006 --> 01:11:24,214
I came in this house
without a asking you.

1181
01:11:25,381 --> 01:11:28,381
I dream without asking you.

1182
01:11:29,465 --> 01:11:31,172
That, I am really your wife.

1183
01:11:33,089 --> 01:11:37,089
Don't assume that
a courtesan cannot love.

1184
01:11:38,547 --> 01:11:40,006
A courtesan can love.

1185
01:11:41,464 --> 01:11:43,672
But she can neither express it.

1186
01:11:44,464 --> 01:11:46,464
Nor she can make believe it.

1187
01:11:48,547 --> 01:11:50,631
What do I answer you?

1188
01:11:51,239 --> 01:11:52,614
Don't tell anything.

1189
01:11:53,155 --> 01:11:54,739
Just keep listening.

1190
01:11:56,572 --> 01:12:00,447
I forgot. I had to put this picture.

1191
01:12:04,822 --> 01:12:07,322
This wall is such an old time wall.

1192
01:12:07,863 --> 01:12:08,780
Careful!

1193
01:12:09,530 --> 01:12:10,697
What are you doing? You'll get hurt.

1194
01:12:13,072 --> 01:12:14,239
What is this?

1195
01:12:15,591 --> 01:12:17,197
Nothing! It's a 'Sari' (dress).

1196
01:12:17,478 --> 01:12:18,864
Brought it for you.

1197
01:12:19,350 --> 01:12:20,075
For me?

1198
01:12:20,155 --> 01:12:22,384
Yes, got an increment
at office for 300 rupees.

1199
01:12:22,731 --> 01:12:24,322
Since this increment
is because of you..

1200
01:12:24,405 --> 01:12:26,989
..I should get something for you.
- Okay!

1201
01:12:27,604 --> 01:12:29,149
Paying me back?

1202
01:12:30,190 --> 01:12:31,197
You cruel!

1203
01:12:31,401 --> 01:12:34,280
You could have lied that,
it's a gift of love.

1204
01:12:34,772 --> 01:12:36,780
I'd have given my life for it.

1205
01:12:38,155 --> 01:12:39,110
Well!

1206
01:12:40,517 --> 01:12:43,364
This is the most
beautiful moment for me.

1207
01:12:44,361 --> 01:12:46,239
And this, most precious gift!

1208
01:12:46,980 --> 01:12:48,489
Wear it on me with your hands!

1209
01:12:50,688 --> 01:12:55,193
If not you then
I'll embrace your 'Sari'.

1210
01:12:57,263 --> 01:13:01,947
Look Sultana! Please behave well,
and with mannerisms.

1211
01:13:02,694 --> 01:13:05,516
Hope it does not put me in trouble.

1212
01:13:06,426 --> 01:13:08,989
What's the time?
They haven't yet come.

1213
01:13:09,609 --> 01:13:10,947
Strange! What could have happened?

1214
01:13:11,970 --> 01:13:13,489
They've come! They've come!

1215
01:13:13,739 --> 01:13:15,030
Behave well, please!

1216
01:13:15,655 --> 01:13:17,655
We've come!
- Welcome Mr. Hafiz!

1217
01:13:17,739 --> 01:13:19,030
Greetings! Greetings!

1218
01:13:19,280 --> 01:13:20,697
Greetings!
- Greetings! - Greetings!

1219
01:13:20,822 --> 01:13:26,655
Fantastic!
May god keep this pair united!

1220
01:13:26,947 --> 01:13:27,905
Good house!

1221
01:13:28,530 --> 01:13:30,072
Greetings!
- Greetings!

1222
01:13:30,447 --> 01:13:31,530
Greetings! Greetings!

1223
01:13:31,853 --> 01:13:33,072
Take, sister in law!

1224
01:13:34,224 --> 01:13:35,580
Made it good!

1225
01:13:35,660 --> 01:13:39,123
Listen! - Mr. Dawood! Dawood!
- Nigam sir.

1226
01:13:39,203 --> 01:13:41,475
Welcome, Nigam sir!
- Be blessed, daughter! This ring!

1227
01:13:41,633 --> 01:13:43,808
Daughter, always wear it!
- Okay!

1228
01:13:44,702 --> 01:13:48,572
Good! Made a great house
of this one room. - Yes, sir.

1229
01:13:48,655 --> 01:13:49,155
Come!

1230
01:13:49,239 --> 01:13:51,780
Mr. Hafiz, shall I sit with you?
Not allergic to cold, I hope.

1231
01:13:52,337 --> 01:13:53,757
Welcome Mr. Lala! Greetings!

1232
01:13:53,837 --> 01:13:55,337
Greetings!
- Be blessed! Be blessed!

1233
01:13:55,420 --> 01:13:56,385
Take this, daughter!

1234
01:13:56,587 --> 01:13:59,212
You people made this
reception into a business.

1235
01:13:59,295 --> 01:14:01,712
Absolutely!
- Can't come empty handed, either.

1236
01:14:02,250 --> 01:14:04,296
Could have just blessed.
It would have been enough.

1237
01:14:04,545 --> 01:14:05,712
May God keep you happy!

1238
01:14:05,795 --> 01:14:08,795
Seen that, Lala?
This is called mannerism.

1239
01:14:09,087 --> 01:14:11,753
It's only found in family circles.

1240
01:14:13,378 --> 01:14:14,462
Welcome, Bai Amma! (mother).

1241
01:14:14,545 --> 01:14:17,030
Come! This is our Bai Amma! (mother).

1242
01:14:17,338 --> 01:14:18,462
Greetings!
- Greetings!

1243
01:14:18,545 --> 01:14:19,753
This is Mr. Nigam!

1244
01:14:19,878 --> 01:14:20,837
Your son's boss.

1245
01:14:20,920 --> 01:14:22,795
Please take!
- Thanks!

1246
01:14:23,128 --> 01:14:26,212
You too take!
- Mother, He's Lala Fakirchand!

1247
01:14:26,295 --> 01:14:27,420
Greetings!
- Greetings!

1248
01:14:28,670 --> 01:14:30,212
Come, the food is ready too.
- Okay!

1249
01:14:30,670 --> 01:14:34,587
Please come! Get up! Get up!
- Lala, Tell me, what's this? 'Ruhafza'.

1250
01:14:34,920 --> 01:14:36,170
This is not good
for people having cold.

1251
01:14:36,253 --> 01:14:37,545
You stop taking Ice.

1252
01:14:37,837 --> 01:14:39,670
Son you take it!
- The food is served for you.

1253
01:14:39,753 --> 01:14:41,045
Please come, Nigam sir! Come!
- Please come!

1254
01:14:46,420 --> 01:14:47,462
Brought that cousin?

1255
01:14:48,123 --> 01:14:50,748
Get it, keep it here!
- Come!

1256
01:14:50,831 --> 01:14:52,373
Oh great!
- Come!

1257
01:14:52,456 --> 01:14:54,498
Cooked so many things!

1258
01:14:54,581 --> 01:14:57,081
It's a reception on behalf
of the entire neighborhood.

1259
01:14:57,165 --> 01:14:58,915
Everyone has got
something or the other.

1260
01:14:58,998 --> 01:15:01,165
Fantastic!
- Nigam sir. - Heard that, Lala?

1261
01:15:01,623 --> 01:15:04,040
Saw what a bride has done?
- I am seeing that.

1262
01:15:04,123 --> 01:15:05,873
Yes, yes, doing!

1263
01:15:07,290 --> 01:15:09,498
Is this rice?
- The rice has meat, isn't it?

1264
01:15:09,706 --> 01:15:11,206
You have 'Mater Pulav'. (rice-peas)

1265
01:15:11,415 --> 01:15:13,290
You are going thin. Eat more!

1266
01:15:13,498 --> 01:15:16,040
I'll eat this only. Nothing
will happen. I'll take out the meat.

1267
01:15:16,123 --> 01:15:17,123
Enough! Enough!

1268
01:15:20,665 --> 01:15:24,665
Mr. Lala, do have cigarettes.
- Cigarettes? Yes!

1269
01:15:24,748 --> 01:15:25,831
Take this!

1270
01:15:30,040 --> 01:15:32,456
You gave her Ice cream? Bad!

1271
01:15:32,998 --> 01:15:35,331
He's got cold!
- Be quite!

1272
01:15:35,498 --> 01:15:37,831
Food was great! Stomach is full.

1273
01:15:37,998 --> 01:15:40,665
We need to have music now,
for digestion.

1274
01:15:40,998 --> 01:15:44,290
Food? You just ate that.
How much more you'll eat?

1275
01:15:44,508 --> 01:15:45,911
Not food, but music.

1276
01:15:46,070 --> 01:15:49,790
Oh music?
- Yes, Sultana sings!

1277
01:15:49,873 --> 01:15:50,790
Sing a song, daughter.

1278
01:15:50,984 --> 01:15:54,373
Yes, please! Please sing.

1279
01:15:57,956 --> 01:16:02,960
"Today's evening in your name."

1280
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:08,123
"Today's evening in your name."

1281
01:16:08,831 --> 01:16:13,040
"In this gathering,
my love salutes everyone."

1282
01:16:13,123 --> 01:16:18,206
"Today's evening in your name."

1283
01:16:18,290 --> 01:16:24,623
"Today's evening in your name."

1284
01:16:52,873 --> 01:16:58,123
"This scene, this atmosphere,
this love, this sincerity."

1285
01:16:58,206 --> 01:17:03,248
"Life has jumped up,
love has found love."

1286
01:17:08,581 --> 01:17:13,623
"Let the times not be annoyed,
let this love never break off."

1287
01:17:13,748 --> 01:17:18,956
"Even if life is a dream,
let the dream never break."

1288
01:17:19,540 --> 01:17:23,873
"Let Love never be stained."

1289
01:17:23,956 --> 01:17:28,960
"Today's evening in your name."

1290
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:34,790
"Today's evening in your name."

1291
01:17:50,982 --> 01:17:56,103
"Let the heart rule,
let the fun prosper"

1292
01:17:56,183 --> 01:18:01,199
"Let this evening be
remembered till morning."

1293
01:18:06,331 --> 01:18:11,373
'Let the era go on,
let the time pass by."

1294
01:18:11,540 --> 01:18:16,456
"If the heart is excited,
let it be excited."

1295
01:18:17,331 --> 01:18:21,581
"Dance and make merry,
whatever be the consequences."

1296
01:18:21,665 --> 01:18:26,748
"Today's evening in your name."

1297
01:18:26,831 --> 01:18:31,665
"Today's evening in your name."

1298
01:18:32,581 --> 01:18:36,873
"In this gathering,
my love salutes everyone."

1299
01:18:36,956 --> 01:18:41,998
"Today's evening in your name."

1300
01:18:42,165 --> 01:18:47,001
"Today's evening in your name."

1301
01:18:47,081 --> 01:18:51,956
"Today's evening in your name."

1302
01:19:14,386 --> 01:19:15,386
Take, minced meat and bread!

1303
01:19:16,303 --> 01:19:17,678
You like it a lot, isn't it?

1304
01:19:19,428 --> 01:19:22,220
Thank god, Rahim went away quietly!

1305
01:19:22,970 --> 01:19:24,553
Else it would have been chaos.

1306
01:19:25,386 --> 01:19:27,220
I'd not have been able
to show my face to anyone.

1307
01:19:28,511 --> 01:19:29,970
What's to be done now?

1308
01:19:31,511 --> 01:19:33,345
Seems like it's time for me to go.

1309
01:19:36,345 --> 01:19:37,886
Look at the cruelty of circumstances!

1310
01:19:38,386 --> 01:19:39,970
People think you are my wife.

1311
01:19:40,678 --> 01:19:44,220
Neither can I tell you to go away,
and neither to wait.

1312
01:19:45,470 --> 01:19:47,261
I understand your problems.

1313
01:19:48,595 --> 01:19:51,636
Don't worry! Leave everything to me.

1314
01:19:53,345 --> 01:19:54,803
You go to office now!

1315
01:19:58,551 --> 01:19:59,605
Listen!

1316
01:20:01,811 --> 01:20:02,932
Your betel!

1317
01:20:07,193 --> 01:20:08,665
Smile and go!

1318
01:20:16,285 --> 01:20:17,909
No, Sultana! No!

1319
01:20:20,105 --> 01:20:22,963
You cannot stay there,
you will have to come here.

1320
01:20:23,214 --> 01:20:26,946
Are you some great, to leave me
or call me whenever you wish to?

1321
01:20:27,354 --> 01:20:28,518
Is Dawood your servant?

1322
01:20:30,343 --> 01:20:32,177
No smartness, okay?

1323
01:20:32,802 --> 01:20:35,427
My name is Rahim Shaikh!
Stop the nonsense!

1324
01:20:35,718 --> 01:20:38,385
I'll break your face. Remember that.

1325
01:20:38,552 --> 01:20:40,552
Won't came.
Her father's rule prevails.

1326
01:20:40,816 --> 01:20:41,968
Come on, make a glass!

1327
01:20:42,703 --> 01:20:43,760
Listen, Rahim Shaikh!

1328
01:20:44,376 --> 01:20:45,802
Dawood is a decent man.

1329
01:20:46,647 --> 01:20:48,302
He helped us in our bad times.

1330
01:20:49,524 --> 01:20:52,218
Will it look good
if I suddenly come here?

1331
01:20:53,095 --> 01:20:55,035
People will ask:
Where's the wife gone?

1332
01:20:55,804 --> 01:20:57,128
What will that poor guy answer then?

1333
01:20:59,431 --> 01:21:01,427
Come here!

1334
01:21:05,262 --> 01:21:08,497
Are you in some relation with him?

1335
01:21:09,363 --> 01:21:10,485
Don't touch me!

1336
01:21:11,183 --> 01:21:14,076
I am not your prostitute now.
I am Dawood's wife.

1337
01:21:15,615 --> 01:21:19,093
You are talking as if you
are really Dawood's wife. Away!

1338
01:21:20,699 --> 01:21:26,468
Even if I am not his real wife,
I am surely Dawood's wife, for the world.

1339
01:21:28,767 --> 01:21:32,809
I cannot just go away
and dirty his house.

1340
01:21:33,764 --> 01:21:38,267
Rahim Shaikh,
Dawood hasn't touched your Sultana.

1341
01:21:39,471 --> 01:21:40,732
You too don't touch his dignity.

1342
01:21:40,812 --> 01:21:42,964
To hell with his dignity.
What about my business?

1343
01:21:43,294 --> 01:21:46,084
Will you ruin him for
all the favors he has done?

1344
01:21:47,676 --> 01:21:50,934
I cannot leave you with him, whole life,
to pay back his favors. Understand?

1345
01:21:51,017 --> 01:21:52,559
When did I say this?
- What else did you mean?

1346
01:21:53,033 --> 01:21:57,892
If I suddenly come, there shall be many
eyebrows raised in the neighborhood.

1347
01:21:58,383 --> 01:21:59,642
There'll be questions asked.

1348
01:22:00,393 --> 01:22:02,309
By all this he shall be defamed.

1349
01:22:04,429 --> 01:22:07,517
Rahim Shaikh,
I became a wife from a courtesan.

1350
01:22:08,580 --> 01:22:11,579
You should give me some time
to become a courtesan from a wife.

1351
01:22:11,659 --> 01:22:12,684
What do you mean?

1352
01:22:13,780 --> 01:22:19,276
I mean, in few days I shall make
some excuse and come by myself.

1353
01:22:20,276 --> 01:22:21,651
So that he's not stained.

1354
01:22:22,776 --> 01:22:27,193
Without any noise,
your Sultana will come back to you.

1355
01:22:27,651 --> 01:22:28,901
Okay, agreed!

1356
01:22:29,568 --> 01:22:31,193
Do remember one thing.

1357
01:22:31,693 --> 01:22:35,401
If you play smart with me,
my name is Rahim Shaikh.

1358
01:22:35,818 --> 01:22:37,068
It doesn't take much
time for Rahim Shaikh's...

1359
01:22:37,151 --> 01:22:39,360
... hands to reach this neck. Okay?

1360
01:22:40,397 --> 01:22:41,437
Okay, bye!

1361
01:22:41,517 --> 01:22:42,549
Listen!

1362
01:22:44,046 --> 01:22:46,171
You look stunning in this dress.

1363
01:22:46,255 --> 01:22:47,755
Don't touch this dress.

1364
01:22:48,337 --> 01:22:49,713
I've carried along Dawood's
respect in this dress.

1365
01:22:49,796 --> 01:22:50,880
Hell with you! Respect.

1366
01:22:50,963 --> 01:22:52,046
Listen!
- What?

1367
01:22:52,713 --> 01:22:55,463
Till I don't come here on my own,
don't come to call me. - Okay!

1368
01:22:55,921 --> 01:22:56,921
I shall come by myself.

1369
01:22:57,255 --> 01:22:58,258
Listen!

1370
01:22:58,338 --> 01:23:01,208
Give my salute to that Dawood.

1371
01:23:04,921 --> 01:23:07,340
Fantastic! She did like this.

1372
01:23:08,291 --> 01:23:09,963
The man seems to
be a respected person.

1373
01:23:11,380 --> 01:23:14,630
These days,
the prices have risen so high.

1374
01:23:14,872 --> 01:23:16,963
Greetings Sultana sister!
- Greetings Sultana!

1375
01:23:17,300 --> 01:23:18,338
Greetings!

1376
01:23:24,821 --> 01:23:26,818
Leave me! What if mother comes?

1377
01:23:26,898 --> 01:23:29,451
Mother has gone to
the market with Ameena Bai.

1378
01:23:34,658 --> 01:23:35,661
Sister in law!

1379
01:23:35,741 --> 01:23:38,783
Where's aunty?
- Gone to the market.

1380
01:23:41,077 --> 01:23:42,199
Come with me!

1381
01:23:44,102 --> 01:23:46,908
It's a new book.
Display it. We'll see, then. - Okay!

1382
01:23:47,194 --> 01:23:48,020
We are trying to, Mr. Lala.

1383
01:23:48,100 --> 01:23:51,324
Dawood, you gave a nice
reception but missed me.

1384
01:23:52,208 --> 01:23:54,824
Not that, sir. You had gone to Delhi.

1385
01:23:55,419 --> 01:23:57,908
Mr. Lala put the whole thing on me,
what could I do?

1386
01:23:58,311 --> 01:24:00,154
Everyone applauds your wife, a lot.

1387
01:24:00,484 --> 01:24:01,949
Do introduce me also sometimes.

1388
01:24:02,825 --> 01:24:05,465
Yes, sir. Whenever you say.

1389
01:24:05,619 --> 01:24:06,824
Mr. Hafiz!
- Yes.

1390
01:24:07,076 --> 01:24:08,658
Put these new books on the shelf.

1391
01:24:08,898 --> 01:24:09,930
And yes.

1392
01:24:10,010 --> 01:24:12,741
Kainat's novel 'Band Darwaza'
has been published.

1393
01:24:12,824 --> 01:24:15,026
Really?
- Look here!

1394
01:24:24,732 --> 01:24:25,806
Stop here, driver!

1395
01:24:37,391 --> 01:24:38,649
Take it back!

1396
01:24:45,081 --> 01:24:45,997
Come!

1397
01:24:47,664 --> 01:24:48,997
Please come, be seated.

1398
01:24:49,581 --> 01:24:52,706
I am not here to be seated today.
I've come to give something.

1399
01:24:52,914 --> 01:24:53,952
What?

1400
01:24:54,247 --> 01:24:57,539
On behalf of 'Kitab Ghar',
I would like...

1401
01:24:58,872 --> 01:25:01,331
...to take the pride of presenting the
first copy of your novel, 'Band Darwaza'.

1402
01:25:01,414 --> 01:25:02,459
My book?

1403
01:25:02,539 --> 01:25:03,622
My book has been published?

1404
01:25:03,706 --> 01:25:05,039
My book has been published?

1405
01:25:05,997 --> 01:25:07,372
Is it really my book?

1406
01:25:11,524 --> 01:25:13,294
Thank you very much Mr. Suleiman!

1407
01:25:15,444 --> 01:25:17,164
I am sorry!

1408
01:25:17,726 --> 01:25:19,122
Mother! Mother!

1409
01:25:19,515 --> 01:25:21,895
What happened? What happened?

1410
01:25:23,378 --> 01:25:25,081
Mr. Suleiman, why is she crying?

1411
01:25:25,371 --> 01:25:26,329
These are ears of happiness.

1412
01:25:26,663 --> 01:25:27,746
He novel has been published.

1413
01:25:28,163 --> 01:25:29,914
Really? - Yes.
- Yes.

1414
01:25:31,513 --> 01:25:32,725
Mother!

1415
01:25:36,780 --> 01:25:37,697
You did not go?

1416
01:25:38,280 --> 01:25:41,697
I had gone, but came back.
- Why?

1417
01:25:43,322 --> 01:25:45,197
You were troubled
because I had come here.

1418
01:25:46,405 --> 01:25:50,489
I wish that there be no
trouble to you after I leave.

1419
01:25:51,739 --> 01:25:54,489
I shall, myself,
go away after 2 to 4 days.

1420
01:25:55,572 --> 01:25:57,030
So that you don't fall in trouble.

1421
01:26:09,279 --> 01:26:10,301
'Band Darwaza'. (The closed Door).

1422
01:26:12,581 --> 01:26:13,985
Kainat Mirza.

1423
01:26:15,325 --> 01:26:16,860
Very beautiful!

1424
01:26:20,424 --> 01:26:22,102
With love to this universe.

1425
01:26:25,131 --> 01:26:29,149
Thinking if God's universe
is more beautiful, or mine.

1426
01:26:30,324 --> 01:26:31,364
Good!

1427
01:26:32,292 --> 01:26:33,470
Why didn't you give her the novel?

1428
01:26:34,288 --> 01:26:35,373
I got late.

1429
01:26:37,745 --> 01:26:39,352
Mr. Suleiman gave it first.

1430
01:26:39,723 --> 01:26:40,962
Beware!

1431
01:26:41,796 --> 01:26:44,588
Hope Mr. Suleiman is not
first in doing other things too.

1432
01:26:45,338 --> 01:26:47,504
What can I do even if does it?

1433
01:26:47,838 --> 01:26:49,379
Afraid of him winning?

1434
01:26:51,591 --> 01:26:53,721
Mr. Suleiman can never win against me.

1435
01:26:54,463 --> 01:26:57,421
Yes, I can surely be defeated by him.

1436
01:27:12,009 --> 01:27:21,588
If I say anything more than thanking
Mr. Suleiman and Mr. Nigam, I shall cry.

1437
01:27:22,251 --> 01:27:26,733
This would be my first
experience to cry in happiness.

1438
01:27:34,480 --> 01:27:37,754
Kainat, how was the celebration?
- Very good.

1439
01:27:38,476 --> 01:27:40,194
How do I thank you?

1440
01:27:40,359 --> 01:27:43,322
Thank Mr. Dawood if you wish to.

1441
01:27:43,550 --> 01:27:45,554
Because, all whatever
happened is because of him.

1442
01:27:45,634 --> 01:27:47,641
Mr. Suleiman please come here!

1443
01:27:48,624 --> 01:27:49,666
I'll be back!

1444
01:27:53,208 --> 01:27:56,291
Should I say thank you?
- Please do!

1445
01:28:04,791 --> 01:28:06,416
Thank you very much!

1446
01:28:09,045 --> 01:28:11,916
Mr. Suleiman,
good party and a good girl too.

1447
01:28:13,222 --> 01:28:16,333
Mr. Suleiman please give us
also a photograph with Kainat Mirza.

1448
01:28:17,404 --> 01:28:18,708
Sure! Sure!

1449
01:28:20,884 --> 01:28:23,083
First copy of the second
edition of my book.

1450
01:28:23,813 --> 01:28:24,898
Please look!

1451
01:28:28,022 --> 01:28:32,522
For Dawood, without whom
my journey would be incomplete.

1452
01:28:33,087 --> 01:28:34,094
With Love.

1453
01:28:35,443 --> 01:28:36,669
Yours, Kainat.

1454
01:28:42,636 --> 01:28:43,636
Thank you!

1455
01:28:45,668 --> 01:28:47,303
Thank you for your book!

1456
01:28:47,650 --> 01:28:49,178
Thank you for your Love!

1457
01:28:49,580 --> 01:28:50,886
Thank you for your greetings too.

1458
01:28:51,106 --> 01:28:53,970
Before this greeting
turns into goodbye.

1459
01:28:54,580 --> 01:28:56,011
Let's go away from here.

1460
01:28:56,759 --> 01:28:58,345
Okay!
- Come on!

1461
01:29:01,749 --> 01:29:03,853
You have taken a promise
not to come to our house.

1462
01:29:03,996 --> 01:29:05,584
I shall abduct and take you.

1463
01:29:05,810 --> 01:29:07,219
Surely, take away!

1464
01:29:07,339 --> 01:29:08,845
Mr. Dawood!
- Sir!

1465
01:29:10,658 --> 01:29:11,783
Are you going?

1466
01:29:12,074 --> 01:29:13,658
Sir, I shall leave her and come.

1467
01:29:13,741 --> 01:29:14,783
Take her in my car.

1468
01:29:14,866 --> 01:29:16,408
The driver too is down.
- Okay!

1469
01:29:17,366 --> 01:29:19,949
Bye!
- Bye!

1470
01:29:22,116 --> 01:29:23,315
Bye!

1471
01:29:24,158 --> 01:29:25,491
Just stop here!

1472
01:29:39,550 --> 01:29:40,598
Listen!

1473
01:29:43,141 --> 01:29:44,831
I want to tell you something.

1474
01:29:45,851 --> 01:29:46,881
Don't tell.

1475
01:29:47,143 --> 01:29:50,197
Because I've heard
what you want to tell.

1476
01:29:57,913 --> 01:29:58,939
Listen.

1477
01:30:27,975 --> 01:30:30,958
Mr. Shakur, what's the chaos?
- Dawood, Nadira has run away.

1478
01:30:31,810 --> 01:30:33,951
Yes, it seems she ran
away with the dance master.

1479
01:30:34,031 --> 01:30:35,271
Very unfortunate happening.

1480
01:30:35,776 --> 01:30:37,113
Very unfortunate happening.

1481
01:30:37,193 --> 01:30:40,196
Father is a devotee and the
daughter is doing like this? Shame!

1482
01:30:40,276 --> 01:30:41,110
Sister.
- Yes.

1483
01:30:41,193 --> 01:30:43,776
Where is Bai Amma (mother)?
- She is in the house of Umar sir.

1484
01:30:44,026 --> 01:30:44,943
Excuse me.

1485
01:30:45,151 --> 01:30:46,735
Uncle! Bai Amma (mother)!

1486
01:30:46,895 --> 01:30:48,943
Dawood, you know, Nadira ran away.

1487
01:30:49,026 --> 01:30:50,764
Yes, that... - No whereabouts
about her since evening.

1488
01:30:52,581 --> 01:30:54,151
We've got ruined, son.

1489
01:30:54,527 --> 01:30:58,069
Never knew that teaching
dance would be so costly.

1490
01:30:59,285 --> 01:31:01,702
Where is Sultana?
- She too is not to be seen since long.

1491
01:31:02,062 --> 01:31:04,610
Did Sultana show her true colours?

1492
01:31:05,251 --> 01:31:07,217
She might have,
possibly, abducted Nadira.

1493
01:31:30,463 --> 01:31:31,640
Come!

1494
01:31:34,588 --> 01:31:37,422
You sit here. I shall be back.
- Where are you going?

1495
01:31:37,505 --> 01:31:39,505
Don't we need a priest
to conduct prayers?

1496
01:31:39,588 --> 01:31:40,508
Okay!

1497
01:31:40,588 --> 01:31:42,088
Close the door from inside.

1498
01:31:56,781 --> 01:31:57,860
Sister in law!

1499
01:31:58,602 --> 01:32:00,097
If you wanted to become a courtesan.

1500
01:32:00,221 --> 01:32:01,672
You should have been
born in a courtesan's house.

1501
01:32:02,700 --> 01:32:06,077
Okay, Tabban! Here is 5000 rupees.

1502
01:32:06,783 --> 01:32:08,063
The remaining, after seeing the girl.

1503
01:32:08,743 --> 01:32:10,880
Where's the girl?
- Come with me! - Come!

1504
01:32:15,054 --> 01:32:16,542
The door is open.

1505
01:32:21,382 --> 01:32:24,094
Where's the girl?
Tell!

1506
01:32:24,174 --> 01:32:26,507
Nadira has come! Nadira has come!

1507
01:32:26,591 --> 01:32:29,341
Nadira has come! Nadira has come!

1508
01:32:29,424 --> 01:32:33,257
Nadira has come! She's with Sultana!

1509
01:32:33,469 --> 01:32:35,507
You idiot! I'll mannered! Shameless!

1510
01:32:35,591 --> 01:32:38,091
Came back after spoiling your respect?
- Get inside!

1511
01:32:38,376 --> 01:32:40,004
Your daughter has come
after blackening her face.

1512
01:32:40,084 --> 01:32:41,716
Go to hell, you idiot!

1513
01:32:42,839 --> 01:32:44,966
Look at your face...
- What are you doing?

1514
01:32:45,049 --> 01:32:46,841
What are you doing? Don't beat.

1515
01:32:46,924 --> 01:32:48,007
Will you kill her or what?

1516
01:32:48,287 --> 01:32:49,382
Move! Come here!

1517
01:32:50,757 --> 01:32:54,716
Nadira, didn't you tell
aunty that you are going with me?

1518
01:32:58,299 --> 01:32:59,841
Didn't you tell?

1519
01:33:00,942 --> 01:33:02,023
No!

1520
01:33:03,567 --> 01:33:04,716
That's so wrong.

1521
01:33:07,138 --> 01:33:08,689
Aunty I am sorry!

1522
01:33:09,394 --> 01:33:11,681
But it was my last day
of visit to the 'Garib Nawaz'.

1523
01:33:12,061 --> 01:33:15,782
Her brother was going to come late,
so I took her along with me.

1524
01:33:16,130 --> 01:33:17,200
There! Hear that!

1525
01:33:18,021 --> 01:33:20,597
What foolishness is this?

1526
01:33:21,649 --> 01:33:22,874
Come with me!

1527
01:33:24,342 --> 01:33:25,690
And you thought something else.

1528
01:33:25,962 --> 01:33:27,619
You beat her so badly.

1529
01:33:28,704 --> 01:33:30,412
What's the use crying now, Nadira?

1530
01:33:30,620 --> 01:33:31,745
You should be ashamed.

1531
01:33:32,120 --> 01:33:35,641
You did this to such
a loving and trusting parents.

1532
01:33:37,079 --> 01:33:38,832
What face would they
show to the world?

1533
01:33:38,912 --> 01:33:39,832
What would they say?

1534
01:33:39,912 --> 01:33:41,665
That their good daughter
ran away with someone?

1535
01:33:43,662 --> 01:33:46,217
Forgive me, sister in law! Forgive me!

1536
01:33:46,662 --> 01:33:49,620
Just imagine,
if I had not followed you while...

1537
01:33:49,704 --> 01:33:52,682
...you were going with that
dance master, do you know...

1538
01:33:52,954 --> 01:33:54,232
...what would have been your fate?

1539
01:33:56,894 --> 01:33:59,064
You would have been
auctioned 3 times so far.

1540
01:34:00,355 --> 01:34:03,620
You would have been
behind the closed doors of...

1541
01:34:03,704 --> 01:34:07,537
...some madam's customer,
and the beds there would be...

1542
01:34:08,001 --> 01:34:10,107
...smelling of other customer's crime.

1543
01:34:11,949 --> 01:34:15,493
Then, you would become
part of that odour.

1544
01:34:15,573 --> 01:34:19,495
You manner less girl,
you played with my respect.

1545
01:34:19,579 --> 01:34:20,995
Leave her, I said! Leave her!

1546
01:34:21,287 --> 01:34:22,412
No house shouting now.

1547
01:34:22,681 --> 01:34:24,419
Will you gather the neighbours now?

1548
01:34:24,625 --> 01:34:26,287
Thank god that Nadira is back safe.

1549
01:34:26,655 --> 01:34:29,329
I suggest: Find a good boy
and get Nadira married. - Yes.

1550
01:34:29,537 --> 01:34:30,662
Nothing has damaged yet.

1551
01:34:31,007 --> 01:34:32,329
Nadira has learned a lesson too.

1552
01:34:35,095 --> 01:34:37,287
Come! Come on, will you?

1553
01:34:37,495 --> 01:34:39,778
Don't beat her now!

1554
01:34:43,239 --> 01:34:47,024
Please forgive me!
- For what?

1555
01:34:49,295 --> 01:34:54,897
For having thought so many
things about you, all this while.

1556
01:34:56,194 --> 01:34:58,401
I am not worth someone's thought.

1557
01:35:00,225 --> 01:35:03,435
It's a favour that you thought of me.

1558
01:35:08,582 --> 01:35:10,915
Listen! I almost forgot.

1559
01:35:11,874 --> 01:35:15,063
Here is your royalty
cheque of 5000 rupees.

1560
01:35:15,767 --> 01:35:17,316
Thank you very much, Mr. Suleiman.

1561
01:35:17,679 --> 01:35:20,707
I won't be able to
repay your kindness.

1562
01:35:20,915 --> 01:35:22,329
At least I can.

1563
01:35:22,661 --> 01:35:23,954
I shall ask it myself.

1564
01:35:24,566 --> 01:35:25,755
As you wish.

1565
01:35:30,017 --> 01:35:31,080
Greetings!

1566
01:35:32,090 --> 01:35:33,028
Oh!

1567
01:35:33,483 --> 01:35:35,941
Mr. Anif! You see it.
- I'll find it out.

1568
01:35:36,024 --> 01:35:37,149
What are you doing
so early in the morning?

1569
01:35:37,358 --> 01:35:41,024
Mr. Suleiman had called.
I had to sign the agreement.

1570
01:35:41,409 --> 01:35:43,351
He has also given the
royalty cheque of 5000 rupees.

1571
01:35:45,733 --> 01:35:47,691
Mr. Suleiman is being
very favourable to you.

1572
01:35:48,191 --> 01:35:49,399
All because of you.

1573
01:35:49,745 --> 01:35:51,690
You've come like an angel in my life.

1574
01:35:55,629 --> 01:35:57,108
So much of applause is not good.

1575
01:35:57,233 --> 01:35:58,649
A person gets spoiled.

1576
01:36:00,358 --> 01:36:01,524
Here is your cheque.

1577
01:36:02,066 --> 01:36:04,739
Okay, I'll leave.
We'll meet in the evening.

1578
01:36:07,358 --> 01:36:08,941
Mr. Suleiman has called for you.

1579
01:36:11,764 --> 01:36:14,747
Mr. Dawood, I had some work with you.

1580
01:36:15,033 --> 01:36:16,092
Yes.

1581
01:36:16,587 --> 01:36:20,949
You had brought Kainat's novel
'Band Darwaza' to me, isn't it?

1582
01:36:21,268 --> 01:36:22,339
Yes.

1583
01:36:22,940 --> 01:36:27,206
You will have to open
this closed door for me.

1584
01:36:28,749 --> 01:36:29,935
I did not get you.

1585
01:36:31,265 --> 01:36:33,761
Mr. Dawood, the thing is that..

1586
01:36:36,078 --> 01:36:39,271
I'm in love with Kainat.

1587
01:36:41,504 --> 01:36:43,756
If I take the message to her, myself..

1588
01:36:45,213 --> 01:36:49,358
..she might think that I am
asking for repayment of favours.

1589
01:36:50,976 --> 01:36:52,869
If you accept this responsibility..

1590
01:36:53,609 --> 01:36:55,163
..I shall be thankful to you.

1591
01:36:57,618 --> 01:37:00,629
Now my love is in your hands,
Mr. Dawood.

1592
01:37:02,029 --> 01:37:03,764
If you wish, things can happen.

1593
01:37:29,169 --> 01:37:33,877
"In the hope of your love."

1594
01:37:34,252 --> 01:37:38,711
"Under the shade
of the sadness of life."

1595
01:37:38,794 --> 01:37:43,461
"The winds are blowing strong."

1596
01:37:43,544 --> 01:37:48,711
"Hope the lamp is not put off."

1597
01:37:48,794 --> 01:37:53,127
"In the hope of your love."

1598
01:37:53,602 --> 01:37:58,211
"Under the shade
of the sadness of life."

1599
01:37:58,294 --> 01:38:02,877
"The winds are blowing strong."

1600
01:38:02,961 --> 01:38:07,961
"Hope the lamp is not put off."

1601
01:38:08,252 --> 01:38:12,877
"In the hope of your love."

1602
01:38:12,961 --> 01:38:17,961
"Under the shade
of the sadness of life."

1603
01:38:37,211 --> 01:38:46,794
"Ours is a strange story."

1604
01:38:47,169 --> 01:38:56,002
"Ours is a strange story."

1605
01:38:56,586 --> 01:39:01,294
"Sometimes you were
unable to understand."

1606
01:39:01,377 --> 01:39:06,336
"Sometimes I could not tell it."

1607
01:39:06,419 --> 01:39:11,044
"In the hope of your love."

1608
01:39:11,127 --> 01:39:15,877
"Under the shade
of the sadness of life."

1609
01:39:15,961 --> 01:39:20,669
"The winds are blowing strong."

1610
01:39:20,752 --> 01:39:25,711
"Hope the lamp is not put off."

1611
01:39:25,794 --> 01:39:30,544
"In the hope of your love."

1612
01:39:30,669 --> 01:39:35,252
"Under the shade
of the sadness of life."

1613
01:39:52,294 --> 01:40:02,044
"Neither can I afford a boat
nor can I see the shores."

1614
01:40:02,294 --> 01:40:11,794
"Neither can I afford a boat
nor can I see the shores."

1615
01:40:11,877 --> 01:40:21,211
"Hope the boat of my heart
is not drowned in the waves."

1616
01:40:21,711 --> 01:40:25,627
"In the hope of your love."

1617
01:40:26,336 --> 01:40:31,086
"Under the shade
of the sadness of life."

1618
01:40:31,169 --> 01:40:35,836
"The winds are blowing strong."

1619
01:40:35,919 --> 01:40:41,044
"Hope the lamp is not put off."

1620
01:40:41,127 --> 01:40:45,589
"In the hope of your love."

1621
01:40:45,669 --> 01:40:51,752
"Under the shade
of the sadness of life."

1622
01:41:03,419 --> 01:41:06,631
Who am I?
- Hi Kainat!

1623
01:41:06,784 --> 01:41:08,961
What happened? Have some annoyance?

1624
01:41:11,002 --> 01:41:13,669
My destiny is annoyed with me.

1625
01:41:15,002 --> 01:41:16,044
God forbid.

1626
01:41:16,585 --> 01:41:21,590
Kainat, our love
is about to die.

1627
01:41:22,852 --> 01:41:23,925
Why?

1628
01:41:26,600 --> 01:41:27,571
Listen, Kainat.

1629
01:41:29,025 --> 01:41:33,418
The general manager of
'Kitab Ghar' wants to marry you.

1630
01:41:35,030 --> 01:41:36,155
What are you saying?

1631
01:41:37,780 --> 01:41:38,826
Right said.

1632
01:41:39,614 --> 01:41:42,864
And that responsibility of getting
the message to you is given to me.

1633
01:41:44,197 --> 01:41:48,780
I have sold my novel through
'Kitab Ghar', but not my life and Love.

1634
01:41:49,239 --> 01:41:50,947
You are not getting me, Kainat.

1635
01:41:52,405 --> 01:41:54,905
Mr. Suleiman is my boss! My officer!

1636
01:41:55,155 --> 01:41:57,072
Because of him your
novel got published.

1637
01:41:58,114 --> 01:42:00,947
My job and your life,
both, are in his hands.

1638
01:42:01,780 --> 01:42:03,364
We both are at stake.

1639
01:42:04,426 --> 01:42:07,134
What is at stake, we'll see that.

1640
01:42:07,676 --> 01:42:11,718
But you tell him
"I am not interested in this proposal."

1641
01:42:12,176 --> 01:42:17,051
If he asks "why"?
Then tell him I like someone else.

1642
01:42:17,134 --> 01:42:20,426
If he asks "who"? Then tell your name.

1643
01:42:21,218 --> 01:42:23,384
Kainat, Love alone is not life.

1644
01:42:24,218 --> 01:42:26,843
The distance between desire
and having it is also called life.

1645
01:42:28,176 --> 01:42:29,343
I also do love.

1646
01:42:29,884 --> 01:42:32,176
But the reality of life
also cannot be forgotten.

1647
01:42:35,926 --> 01:42:37,634
The house rent, electricity bill..

1648
01:42:37,968 --> 01:42:40,259
..ration card,
bus ticket, this is what life is.

1649
01:42:40,509 --> 01:42:46,551
Bus ticket, electricity bill, house rent,
ration card, these are all there.

1650
01:42:46,968 --> 01:42:50,426
But I don't wish to get married
to electricity bill and ration card.

1651
01:42:50,968 --> 01:42:53,884
If these are the names for a husband,
and life..

1652
01:42:54,357 --> 01:42:57,301
then, neither do
I want a husband nor a life.

1653
01:43:00,676 --> 01:43:01,968
Dawood is right.

1654
01:43:02,343 --> 01:43:04,713
Life will not go on with love alone.

1655
01:43:05,384 --> 01:43:09,259
By god's grace,
Suleiman has a nice house, a good job..

1656
01:43:09,343 --> 01:43:11,448
..a new car, a good salary.

1657
01:43:11,801 --> 01:43:12,801
What else do you want?

1658
01:43:13,254 --> 01:43:16,865
Mother, I told you, I don't
want to marry a house, car and salary.

1659
01:43:16,945 --> 01:43:18,138
I want to marry a man.

1660
01:43:18,312 --> 01:43:20,801
Dawood is the first
and last man in my life.

1661
01:43:21,515 --> 01:43:23,551
I shall only get married to him only.

1662
01:43:23,727 --> 01:43:25,664
Whose marriage is being discussed?

1663
01:43:25,840 --> 01:43:27,473
Hers, and whose?

1664
01:43:27,785 --> 01:43:29,869
Don't know what's gone into her head.

1665
01:43:29,952 --> 01:43:32,910
Says, she'll only
get married to Dawood.

1666
01:43:34,369 --> 01:43:36,702
Dawood is a good man.

1667
01:43:37,410 --> 01:43:39,285
Will he do a second marriage?

1668
01:43:39,910 --> 01:43:41,619
Second marriage?
- What?

1669
01:43:42,119 --> 01:43:45,577
I know about one wife, at least.

1670
01:43:45,827 --> 01:43:47,202
You are lying.

1671
01:43:47,452 --> 01:43:51,869
Kainat, I am not fond of lying.
Nor it is a habit.

1672
01:43:52,577 --> 01:43:54,119
You may ask the people in the office.

1673
01:43:54,702 --> 01:43:55,910
Ask Nigam sir.

1674
01:43:56,222 --> 01:43:59,952
If you still don't believe,
ask Dawood.

1675
01:44:17,165 --> 01:44:19,943
You are Kainat Mirza, isn't it?

1676
01:44:23,994 --> 01:44:25,178
Please come!

1677
01:44:31,045 --> 01:44:33,466
So you are Mrs. Dawood?

1678
01:44:35,744 --> 01:44:37,952
This was not my destiny.

1679
01:44:38,353 --> 01:44:39,702
I am only Sultana.

1680
01:44:40,741 --> 01:44:42,898
I am not interested in your name.

1681
01:44:44,723 --> 01:44:47,078
Not in me too?
- No!

1682
01:44:49,235 --> 01:44:51,660
Then what you want?

1683
01:44:52,094 --> 01:44:54,053
I just came to tell Dawood that,

1684
01:44:54,660 --> 01:44:58,688
It was the most unfortunate
moment in my life when I had met him.

1685
01:45:00,478 --> 01:45:02,577
And I can only say that..

1686
01:45:03,720 --> 01:45:07,452
You are not trying to understand
whatever you are seeing.

1687
01:45:07,871 --> 01:45:09,496
Isn't it enough to
understand that, the...

1688
01:45:09,788 --> 01:45:13,496
...one who I loved has deceived me?

1689
01:45:14,353 --> 01:45:16,019
If you have learned to love..

1690
01:45:16,686 --> 01:45:18,519
..learn to express it too.

1691
01:45:19,686 --> 01:45:23,237
Whatever the eyes see,
may not be true always.

1692
01:45:24,978 --> 01:45:28,853
God promise, I am not his wife.

1693
01:45:32,348 --> 01:45:35,089
People like us are not
born to be anyone's wife.

1694
01:45:37,225 --> 01:45:38,911
Neither am I his "keep."

1695
01:45:40,644 --> 01:45:44,538
You can say that I am one
dirty book which Dawood has...

1696
01:45:45,811 --> 01:45:49,208
...kept it with him like a Quran.

1697
01:45:51,061 --> 01:45:52,634
Please believe me, Kainat sister.

1698
01:45:54,186 --> 01:45:55,694
I have seen may humans..

1699
01:45:57,144 --> 01:45:58,811
But I've seen only one Angel.

1700
01:46:00,579 --> 01:46:01,660
Dawood.

1701
01:46:02,936 --> 01:46:05,716
Someone who keeps smiling
despite having lost a winning battle.

1702
01:46:08,103 --> 01:46:12,677
This personality has made
this small house as holy as a mosque.

1703
01:46:14,519 --> 01:46:19,512
The atmosphere of which has
changed a courtesan into a woman.

1704
01:46:22,428 --> 01:46:24,978
I didn't understand.

1705
01:46:25,819 --> 01:46:26,940
I'll explain.

1706
01:46:29,117 --> 01:46:30,279
I am a courtesan.

1707
01:46:32,127 --> 01:46:35,019
I am the reality of the
character you spoke about in...

1708
01:46:36,417 --> 01:46:37,728
...your novel 'Band Darwaza'.

1709
01:47:01,285 --> 01:47:03,573
You are here? At this hour?

1710
01:47:05,914 --> 01:47:06,853
What are you doing?

1711
01:47:07,558 --> 01:47:11,519
Just felt like worshipping you.

1712
01:47:12,405 --> 01:47:14,363
Worship?
- Yes.

1713
01:47:15,488 --> 01:47:17,822
I am here after meeting Sultana.

1714
01:47:18,837 --> 01:47:19,780
Met Sultana?

1715
01:47:23,507 --> 01:47:24,426
Greetings.

1716
01:47:25,875 --> 01:47:27,257
Kainat is not at home.

1717
01:47:27,901 --> 01:47:30,949
I know that.
I had come to meet you madam.

1718
01:47:31,983 --> 01:47:34,803
Me?
- Can I come inside?

1719
01:47:35,649 --> 01:47:36,744
Yes, please come!

1720
01:47:42,583 --> 01:47:43,639
Please be seated!

1721
01:47:44,320 --> 01:47:45,405
Thank you!

1722
01:47:47,138 --> 01:47:48,096
Tell me!

1723
01:47:48,971 --> 01:47:54,763
I have come with Dawood's
proposal for your daughter.

1724
01:47:54,846 --> 01:47:58,013
Why should I send my
daughter to be second wife?

1725
01:47:58,680 --> 01:48:00,138
She's come with a proposal.

1726
01:48:00,638 --> 01:48:03,971
Who are you, to him?
- No one.

1727
01:48:04,221 --> 01:48:05,805
Then how come you have
brought the proposal?

1728
01:48:06,027 --> 01:48:08,055
Has he divorced his first wife?

1729
01:48:08,611 --> 01:48:10,846
Dawood is unmarried, madam.

1730
01:48:11,096 --> 01:48:13,221
Who is the one living with him?

1731
01:48:15,142 --> 01:48:16,138
That's me.

1732
01:48:17,358 --> 01:48:21,346
The people in the neighbourhood and at
'Kitab Ghar' think of me as his wife.

1733
01:48:22,028 --> 01:48:25,555
But I am not his wife.
- Then who are you?

1734
01:48:26,188 --> 01:48:29,688
I am just the result
of his cruel condition, madam.

1735
01:48:30,569 --> 01:48:31,646
AI am an incident!

1736
01:48:32,813 --> 01:48:36,313
I am the abuse that he gets,
I am a curse.

1737
01:48:37,836 --> 01:48:41,396
Save Kainat and Dawood's
life from being ruined madam!

1738
01:48:42,855 --> 01:48:44,855
They love each other very much.

1739
01:48:45,866 --> 01:48:49,105
But how can this be possible?

1740
01:48:52,423 --> 01:48:53,521
Because you are there!

1741
01:48:56,484 --> 01:49:05,980
I promise you that I shall
go away from their lives in 24 hours.

1742
01:49:09,273 --> 01:49:11,980
Give me Kainat, madam!

1743
01:49:25,063 --> 01:49:27,646
Where did you go?
- Nowhere!

1744
01:49:29,717 --> 01:49:30,835
Did you meet Kainat?

1745
01:49:32,733 --> 01:49:34,105
I had the desire to meet her.

1746
01:49:35,044 --> 01:49:36,271
That too has been fulfilled today.

1747
01:49:39,508 --> 01:49:45,313
Dawood, your Kainat is indeed
more beautiful than god's universe.

1748
01:49:47,448 --> 01:49:49,406
Kainat too was appreciating you.

1749
01:49:53,281 --> 01:49:54,781
Tell me, Dawood..

1750
01:49:57,448 --> 01:50:01,948
.."will you remember me if I go away?"

1751
01:50:02,991 --> 01:50:04,906
Sultana, you are not something
that can be forgotten.

1752
01:50:08,364 --> 01:50:12,281
You are a part of my good or bad life.

1753
01:50:13,739 --> 01:50:18,906
Only after I met you did I know
that there is an idol in every stone.

1754
01:50:21,054 --> 01:50:22,823
It's not an abuse to be a courtesan.

1755
01:50:23,776 --> 01:50:24,989
It's a compulsion.

1756
01:50:27,134 --> 01:50:30,926
Despite being a courtesan,
there is a woman in you.

1757
01:50:31,676 --> 01:50:33,301
She is pure.

1758
01:50:33,676 --> 01:50:34,967
Just like God's name.

1759
01:50:35,426 --> 01:50:36,509
Enough Dawood!

1760
01:50:37,759 --> 01:50:39,426
Else I shall start crying.

1761
01:50:50,534 --> 01:50:52,652
Come, I've set the breakfast.

1762
01:50:56,199 --> 01:50:57,783
Why did you prepared so many dishes?

1763
01:50:59,408 --> 01:51:01,074
You praised me so much yesterday,

1764
01:51:01,616 --> 01:51:03,908
So I thought of sweetening you too.

1765
01:51:05,699 --> 01:51:07,033
Don't spoil my habits.

1766
01:51:07,949 --> 01:51:09,491
What will I do after you go away?

1767
01:51:12,116 --> 01:51:14,408
Kainat will feed you even better food.

1768
01:51:20,084 --> 01:51:21,116
Time to go now.

1769
01:51:21,962 --> 01:51:23,028
You too eat!

1770
01:51:23,809 --> 01:51:24,984
I'll eat later!

1771
01:51:30,182 --> 01:51:31,256
Okay, bye!

1772
01:51:37,205 --> 01:51:38,367
Thanks!

1773
01:51:41,211 --> 01:51:42,380
What are you doing?

1774
01:51:44,222 --> 01:51:45,840
I have touched and seen your heart.

1775
01:51:47,511 --> 01:51:49,520
I felt like touching your feet too.

1776
01:52:29,285 --> 01:52:30,368
Sultana..

1777
01:52:35,412 --> 01:52:39,618
Why are you crying?
- Nothing!

1778
01:52:46,497 --> 01:52:47,413
I'm leaving!

1779
01:52:53,538 --> 01:52:54,497
Where are you going?

1780
01:52:55,330 --> 01:52:56,497
To leave you till the bus stand.

1781
01:52:59,580 --> 01:53:02,788
What's happening today?
I just can't understand.

1782
01:53:02,872 --> 01:53:06,538
Nothing.
I feel like going with you today.

1783
01:53:19,539 --> 01:53:23,248
Sometimes I feel that after
you go away, I'll feel strange.

1784
01:53:23,873 --> 01:53:25,498
Won't feel anything.

1785
01:53:26,289 --> 01:53:29,123
When Kainat comes,
you'll forget everything.

1786
01:53:29,664 --> 01:53:30,956
Like a dream.

1787
01:53:32,373 --> 01:53:34,039
Some dreams are not forgotten.

1788
01:53:46,201 --> 01:53:48,252
Okay, good bye!

1789
01:53:52,357 --> 01:53:53,406
Good bye!

1790
01:54:06,415 --> 01:54:09,412
It's time to say good
bye to this room too.

1791
01:54:10,495 --> 01:54:12,787
I got a lot from this room.

1792
01:54:13,238 --> 01:54:14,620
Got lots of respect.

1793
01:54:15,245 --> 01:54:16,495
Got lots of love.

1794
01:54:18,495 --> 01:54:20,370
Here, I became a
woman from a courtesan.

1795
01:54:21,823 --> 01:54:25,454
And a wife from a woman...
that I could not become.

1796
01:54:26,309 --> 01:54:28,662
There is so much
purity in the word wife.

1797
01:54:28,954 --> 01:54:30,870
There is so much
godliness in this name.

1798
01:54:31,466 --> 01:54:34,329
Family life is always
like a dream for us.

1799
01:54:35,787 --> 01:54:38,245
I have seen this
dream from very close.

1800
01:54:42,662 --> 01:54:45,162
I am taking this dream with me today.

1801
01:54:49,829 --> 01:54:52,037
I shall not go to Rahim now.

1802
01:54:52,546 --> 01:54:54,704
Neither will I go to the market.

1803
01:55:05,346 --> 01:55:06,370
Where are you going, daughter?

1804
01:55:07,788 --> 01:55:11,995
Mother is very ill.
So I have to go suddenly.

1805
01:55:12,202 --> 01:55:13,537
Does Dawood know about it?

1806
01:55:14,454 --> 01:55:18,329
If I had told him
he would not let me go.

1807
01:55:18,620 --> 01:55:19,700
That's true.

1808
01:55:21,321 --> 01:55:23,079
I shall miss you a lot.

1809
01:55:23,162 --> 01:55:26,579
Okay! Okay! Daughter, Why do you cry?

1810
01:55:27,987 --> 01:55:29,954
We shall call you soon.

1811
01:55:30,364 --> 01:55:32,995
Go safely, and come back safely.

1812
01:55:33,562 --> 01:55:34,882
Bai Amma.

1813
01:55:40,470 --> 01:55:41,780
Ameena Bai, taxi has come.

1814
01:55:44,201 --> 01:55:47,537
Daughter, we shall not
forget your favour for life.

1815
01:55:47,823 --> 01:55:48,912
Come soon!

1816
01:55:51,823 --> 01:55:54,281
Sister in law,
father told me you are going.

1817
01:55:54,906 --> 01:55:56,035
How are you Nadira?

1818
01:55:56,115 --> 01:55:57,781
Fine! All thanks to you.

1819
01:56:07,490 --> 01:56:11,156
Daughter, some food for your journey,
and this money.

1820
01:56:11,448 --> 01:56:12,781
What was need for this?

1821
01:56:12,990 --> 01:56:15,281
Will a mother send
a daughter empty handed?

1822
01:56:15,698 --> 01:56:16,694
Bai Amma!

1823
01:56:29,115 --> 01:56:31,615
Good bye daughter!
- Good bye, mother!

1824
01:57:00,776 --> 01:57:02,394
So this was your trick?

1825
01:57:02,789 --> 01:57:04,717
Rahim Shaikh please let me go,
for god's sake!

1826
01:57:04,797 --> 01:57:05,806
Shut up.

1827
01:57:05,886 --> 01:57:08,402
This is why you were saying let me
live there, it's a matter of his respect?

1828
01:57:08,627 --> 01:57:10,580
Rahim Shaikh please let me go,
I beg of you.

1829
01:57:10,663 --> 01:57:12,538
No nonsense! Else I'll break
your face. You know who I am.

1830
01:57:12,622 --> 01:57:14,872
Come, let's go.

1831
01:57:19,038 --> 01:57:20,288
Sultana!

1832
01:57:22,105 --> 01:57:23,955
Brother, follow that taxi!

1833
01:57:31,607 --> 01:57:36,607
My Dawood, no one will be so
regretful to leave this world, as...

1834
01:57:37,774 --> 01:57:40,482
...much I regret going
away from your house.

1835
01:57:41,819 --> 01:57:43,774
But what right do I have over this?

1836
01:57:44,732 --> 01:57:46,315
Had come without invitation..

1837
01:57:47,315 --> 01:57:48,774
..going without informing.

1838
01:57:50,476 --> 01:57:53,440
But I am taking away
many sweet memories along.

1839
01:57:55,069 --> 01:57:57,044
The love and respect
that I got from here...

1840
01:57:58,498 --> 01:58:00,262
...I'll never be able to forget that.

1841
01:58:01,255 --> 01:58:03,607
You get married to Kainat soon.

1842
01:58:04,707 --> 01:58:08,172
My love and prayers will
always be with you both.

1843
01:58:09,748 --> 01:58:13,574
If possible do remember
this courtesan sometimes.

1844
01:58:14,755 --> 01:58:18,796
Someone who is taking away
a beautiful message from this house.

1845
01:58:19,713 --> 01:58:21,546
That, every woman is a Koran..

1846
01:58:22,713 --> 01:58:26,130
..if the one reading it is Dawood.

1847
01:58:27,384 --> 01:58:30,279
Yours, and not yours too.

1848
01:58:31,383 --> 01:58:32,380
Sultana!

1849
01:58:32,623 --> 01:58:35,963
The dinner is kept on the table.
Do eat it!

1850
01:59:29,148 --> 01:59:32,356
The dinner is kept on the table.
Do eat it!

1851
02:00:12,540 --> 02:00:13,767
Sultana!

1852
02:00:18,141 --> 02:00:19,641
Will you not say to come inside?

1853
02:00:22,849 --> 02:00:23,961
Where did you go away?

1854
02:00:25,099 --> 02:00:28,724
Wherever I had gone,
now I've come back.

1855
02:00:30,224 --> 02:00:31,599
Never to go back!

1856
02:00:36,680 --> 02:00:39,724
You didn't have the meal?

1857
02:00:43,458 --> 02:00:47,099
Couldn't eat without you.

1858
02:00:50,368 --> 02:00:51,724
Oh no! I'm dead!

1859
02:00:56,966 --> 02:00:58,416
Sultana!
- Yes.

1860
02:01:00,349 --> 02:01:01,849
Never leave me and go!

1861
02:01:06,686 --> 02:01:07,944
I'll never go!

1862
02:01:12,319 --> 02:01:14,599
While you were here, it never felt so.

1863
02:01:15,456 --> 02:01:17,248
But after you went away,
it felt as if...

1864
02:01:17,706 --> 02:01:19,581
...I cannot live without you.

1865
02:01:23,331 --> 02:01:25,998
You have become a
permanent part of my life.

1866
02:01:26,623 --> 02:01:28,039
Really?
- Yes.

1867
02:01:28,539 --> 02:01:33,373
I love you very much, Sultana.

1868
02:01:33,998 --> 02:01:38,123
But I have always been loving you.

1869
02:01:54,755 --> 02:01:55,800
Bai Amma (Mother).

1870
02:01:56,716 --> 02:01:57,793
What are you doing, son?

1871
02:02:03,046 --> 02:02:04,380
You didn't eat your meal?

1872
02:02:05,046 --> 02:02:07,171
Sultana had prepared
it before leaving.

1873
02:02:07,505 --> 02:02:08,588
Not hungry!

1874
02:02:09,296 --> 02:02:11,713
Not just yours,
everyone's hunger is dead.

1875
02:02:11,921 --> 02:02:14,130
No one ate food in
the neighborhood today.

1876
02:02:15,338 --> 02:02:19,130
After Sultana went away,
the life here too went away.

1877
02:02:20,755 --> 02:02:24,005
Don't know whether she
has eaten or not, on the way.

1878
02:02:24,713 --> 02:02:26,380
Won't dance? Won't do business?

1879
02:02:26,460 --> 02:02:28,963
Even your mother
will do whatever I say.

1880
02:02:29,171 --> 02:02:35,630
No Rahim! I'll give my life away
but won't step into your world.

1881
02:02:36,421 --> 02:02:38,255
Now I won't become a courtesan.

1882
02:02:38,338 --> 02:02:42,046
Let me see how you won't become!

1883
02:02:42,951 --> 02:02:44,265
Stupid!

1884
02:02:48,856 --> 02:02:57,265
Even after being a woman, I felt like
a woman only within those four walls.

1885
02:02:59,322 --> 02:03:04,932
First time I realized that these bangles
mean, a sign of a married woman.

1886
02:03:07,423 --> 02:03:10,843
First time I realized that,
the wait to...

1887
02:03:10,923 --> 02:03:12,673
...hear the footsteps of
the husband after he's left...

1888
02:03:12,756 --> 02:03:15,798
...in the morning,
is called "awaiting."

1889
02:03:16,298 --> 02:03:20,256
First time I realized that,
only after being called a wife...

1890
02:03:20,964 --> 02:03:23,548
...a spirit comes alive
in a woman's body.

1891
02:03:26,076 --> 02:03:31,839
I wasn't a wife,
but the misunderstandings about...

1892
02:03:32,423 --> 02:03:35,714
...being a wife blew few hearts into
this lifeless body of this courtesan.

1893
02:03:37,871 --> 02:03:41,631
Rahim, I am no more a prostitute.

1894
02:03:43,709 --> 02:03:45,158
I am woman now.

1895
02:03:48,326 --> 02:03:49,663
Let me be a woman only!

1896
02:03:50,013 --> 02:03:53,996
Spending few days with that Dawood...

1897
02:03:54,163 --> 02:03:55,079
...has got you out of your mind?

1898
02:03:55,580 --> 02:03:57,496
You really started thinking
that you are his wife?

1899
02:03:57,829 --> 02:03:59,829
Mahmood, come here!

1900
02:04:00,121 --> 02:04:01,829
Go and bring that Dawood's
dead body from his house...

1901
02:04:01,913 --> 02:04:02,954
...and throw it under her feet.

1902
02:04:03,038 --> 02:04:05,913
Then she will know what I am.
- No Rahim! No!

1903
02:04:06,488 --> 02:04:10,579
Don't do anything to Dawood,
I beg of you!

1904
02:04:12,329 --> 02:04:13,416
Will you dance?

1905
02:04:13,496 --> 02:04:17,996
Yes, I will do whatever you tell.

1906
02:04:18,121 --> 02:04:19,496
Now you've come to your place.

1907
02:04:19,871 --> 02:04:20,996
Get it!

1908
02:04:23,079 --> 02:04:25,746
Take, get ready!

1909
02:04:26,329 --> 02:04:27,288
Bloody!

1910
02:04:37,414 --> 02:04:39,164
You have the promise of Bibi Fatima!

1911
02:04:40,123 --> 02:04:41,956
Save me from being a courtesan.

1912
02:04:42,748 --> 02:04:45,748
Gaffur-ul-Rahim, save me!

1913
02:04:46,728 --> 02:04:47,690
Amen!

1914
02:04:51,609 --> 02:04:52,744
Who are you?

1915
02:04:55,396 --> 02:04:56,489
Kainat?

1916
02:04:57,062 --> 02:04:58,146
Why have you come here?

1917
02:04:58,729 --> 02:05:00,187
I've come to take you!

1918
02:05:00,604 --> 02:05:03,062
No, Kainat! No! You go away from here!

1919
02:05:03,479 --> 02:05:04,896
These people are very cruel.

1920
02:05:04,979 --> 02:05:06,354
Please go away!

1921
02:05:06,812 --> 02:05:11,354
No, Sultana! This is not your place.
It's Dawood's house.

1922
02:05:14,187 --> 02:05:15,187
Dawood's house?

1923
02:05:16,396 --> 02:05:24,437
Whether he has told you or not,
but he loves you.

1924
02:05:25,215 --> 02:05:26,465
I am a woman.

1925
02:05:27,131 --> 02:05:31,923
I know it well that,
you both love each other.

1926
02:05:32,694 --> 02:05:34,090
And are made for each other.

1927
02:05:35,084 --> 02:05:38,423
No, Kainat. Now nothing can be done.

1928
02:05:39,754 --> 02:05:41,548
For god's sake, you go away from here.

1929
02:05:44,006 --> 02:05:50,215
Tell Dawood that he's got too late.

1930
02:05:50,557 --> 02:05:53,543
I don't know what's to be done.

1931
02:05:53,872 --> 02:05:55,409
I'll tell you what's to be done.

1932
02:05:56,418 --> 02:05:59,392
As a token of my love,
you bring Sultana home.

1933
02:06:01,222 --> 02:06:02,402
Yes.

1934
02:06:04,121 --> 02:06:09,279
Dawood, the truth is that I can
find another Dawood somewhere else.

1935
02:06:10,203 --> 02:06:14,889
But Sultana will
not find another Dawood.

1936
02:06:17,227 --> 02:06:18,185
No, Kainat.

1937
02:06:20,143 --> 02:06:23,518
I cannot ask you
for such a heavy price.

1938
02:06:24,352 --> 02:06:27,518
At whatever price you get life,
it's cheap.

1939
02:06:27,852 --> 02:06:32,435
Dawood, you go and get your life back!

1940
02:06:32,662 --> 02:06:36,643
Kainat, I don't know who life is!

1941
02:06:37,140 --> 02:06:38,932
Don't lie to yourself, Dawood!

1942
02:06:39,557 --> 02:06:40,807
You know very well
that at this moment..

1943
02:06:41,223 --> 02:06:45,515
..your life is becoming a courtesan
at the goon Rahim's place.

1944
02:06:48,239 --> 02:06:49,348
Strange!

1945
02:06:49,938 --> 02:06:53,104
You kept her home while
she was a courtesan.

1946
02:06:53,729 --> 02:06:55,813
Now, when she became a woman..

1947
02:06:56,271 --> 02:06:59,563
..you let her go away to
become a courtesan, again?

1948
02:07:00,282 --> 02:07:02,771
A courtesan? Who, courtesan?

1949
02:07:07,646 --> 02:07:08,979
Tell! Who, courtesan?

1950
02:07:11,771 --> 02:07:12,909
Sultana!

1951
02:07:17,686 --> 02:07:20,563
Sultana? A courtesan?

1952
02:07:37,913 --> 02:07:45,396
"I was waiting since very long."

1953
02:07:46,184 --> 02:07:51,521
"You took too long to come."

1954
02:07:51,605 --> 02:07:56,646
"You took too long to come."

1955
02:07:57,114 --> 02:08:02,271
"I was waiting since very long."

1956
02:08:02,355 --> 02:08:07,771
"You took too long to come."

1957
02:08:07,855 --> 02:08:13,605
"You took too long to come."

1958
02:08:14,023 --> 02:08:20,896
"I was waiting since very long."

1959
02:08:21,255 --> 02:08:27,480
"You took too long to come."

1960
02:08:28,238 --> 02:08:39,896
"Savior, you got too late in
getting the medicine for this sick."

1961
02:08:39,980 --> 02:08:45,813
"Got too late getting the medicine."

1962
02:09:06,896 --> 02:09:12,230
"Couldn't hear few words of love."

1963
02:09:12,313 --> 02:09:18,021
"Couldn't pick few
flowers of honesty."

1964
02:09:23,105 --> 02:09:28,563
"Couldn't hear few words of love."

1965
02:09:28,646 --> 02:09:33,730
"Couldn't pick few
flowers of honesty."

1966
02:09:33,810 --> 02:09:39,396
"Oh cruel one,
you too had desires for me."

1967
02:09:39,480 --> 02:09:44,563
"Oh cruel one,
you too had desires for me."

1968
02:09:44,643 --> 02:09:49,837
"Got too late telling it."

1969
02:09:49,917 --> 02:09:55,177
"Got too late telling it."

1970
02:09:55,257 --> 02:10:00,841
"I was waiting since very long."

1971
02:10:00,921 --> 02:10:05,976
"You took too long to come."

1972
02:10:06,056 --> 02:10:12,441
"You took too long to come."

1973
02:10:37,999 --> 02:10:43,332
"The desires will die in few moments."

1974
02:10:43,416 --> 02:10:49,041
"All my memorable dreams
shall be shattered."

1975
02:10:53,939 --> 02:10:59,567
"The desires will die in few moments."

1976
02:10:59,647 --> 02:11:04,774
"All my memorable dreams
shall be shattered."

1977
02:11:04,857 --> 02:11:10,011
"Always hearing and
always taking stock."

1978
02:11:10,091 --> 02:11:15,362
"Always hearing and
always taking stock."

1979
02:11:15,442 --> 02:11:20,821
"Got too late getting the address."

1980
02:11:20,901 --> 02:11:26,097
"Got too late getting the address."

1981
02:11:26,177 --> 02:11:31,622
"I was waiting since very long."

1982
02:11:31,702 --> 02:11:36,732
"You took too long to come."

1983
02:11:36,980 --> 02:11:41,730
"You took too long to come."

1984
02:11:41,814 --> 02:11:45,064
"You took too long to come."

1985
02:11:47,022 --> 02:11:51,022
"You took too long to come."

1986
02:11:52,397 --> 02:11:55,814
"You took too long to come."

1987
02:11:57,689 --> 02:12:01,022
"You took too long to come."

1988
02:12:02,980 --> 02:12:06,647
"You took too long to come."

1989
02:12:30,397 --> 02:12:31,647
Sultana!

1990
02:12:34,118 --> 02:12:35,064
Sultana!

1991
02:12:35,147 --> 02:12:36,397
Sultana!

1992
02:12:38,047 --> 02:12:40,689
God, you?

1993
02:12:42,220 --> 02:12:47,230
If this is a dream, then by god's grace
this dream should never be shattered.

1994
02:12:47,700 --> 02:12:48,920
This is not a dream, Sultana.

1995
02:12:50,117 --> 02:12:51,772
This is the coming true,
of our dreams.

1996
02:12:53,928 --> 02:12:55,312
I am here for you.

1997
02:12:57,259 --> 02:12:58,332
Heard this, all of you?

1998
02:12:59,274 --> 02:13:01,691
Did you hear this cartoon's joke?

1999
02:13:02,357 --> 02:13:05,107
He shall take away Sultana
in the presence of Rahim Shaikh.

2000
02:13:06,903 --> 02:13:08,040
Sultana!

2001
02:13:08,584 --> 02:13:13,649
So, will you take her?
- Yes. - Is it?

2002
02:13:17,978 --> 02:13:23,399
Even the military cannot enter our lane,
and you will take her away from here?

2003
02:13:24,381 --> 02:13:25,589
Will you take her?

2004
02:13:25,672 --> 02:13:27,339
Who are you to look after her?

2005
02:13:32,002 --> 02:13:33,177
I am her husband!

2006
02:13:33,551 --> 02:13:35,058
You bloody husband!

2007
02:13:35,584 --> 02:13:38,311
Courtesans have pimps, not husbands.

2008
02:13:38,842 --> 02:13:40,651
She is not a Courtesans, but my wife.

2009
02:13:41,350 --> 02:13:42,371
A wife?

2010
02:13:42,574 --> 02:13:44,650
In what relationship?

2011
02:13:44,819 --> 02:13:45,935
In human relationships!

2012
02:13:46,015 --> 02:13:47,002
In the relationship of Love.

2013
02:13:47,140 --> 02:13:49,657
Where is the marriage
certificate of the priest?

2014
02:13:50,025 --> 02:13:51,839
When did you marry him?

2015
02:13:52,089 --> 02:13:54,214
Marriage is the union of two souls,
Rahim Shaikh.

2016
02:13:55,078 --> 02:13:57,047
It's not confined to a piece
of paper or a marriage certificate.

2017
02:13:57,864 --> 02:13:59,006
I have taken her as my wife at heart.

2018
02:13:59,089 --> 02:14:00,414
You hearty man!

2019
02:14:01,247 --> 02:14:02,203
Don't talk much about heart.

2020
02:14:02,283 --> 02:14:04,506
Else, I'll put this knife inside
and take your heart out.

2021
02:14:04,828 --> 02:14:06,495
There'll be a 12 inch hole.

2022
02:14:06,578 --> 02:14:09,495
Do it! Let there be a competition
between cruelty and decency.

2023
02:14:09,828 --> 02:14:12,870
Rahim Shaikh, let's see if
decency is more powerful, or cruelty.

2024
02:14:13,203 --> 02:14:14,537
Is it?

2025
02:14:15,703 --> 02:14:17,078
Mohammed!
- Yes master!

2026
02:14:17,162 --> 02:14:18,578
Jaffar!
- Yes master!

2027
02:14:18,912 --> 02:14:20,745
Mahmood!
- Master!

2028
02:14:21,778 --> 02:14:23,464
Show him the face of death!

2029
02:14:29,407 --> 02:14:30,675
Shut up!
- No!

2030
02:14:38,391 --> 02:14:39,805
Dawood!

2031
02:14:42,597 --> 02:14:43,665
No!

2032
02:14:45,952 --> 02:14:48,012
No, Rahim!

2033
02:14:49,143 --> 02:14:50,727
Rahim, please let Dawood go!

2034
02:14:50,810 --> 02:14:51,893
Please let him go!

2035
02:14:52,518 --> 02:14:54,018
Wanted to be a hero, isn't it?

2036
02:14:54,102 --> 02:14:56,310
Beat him up more! Beat him!
- No!

2037
02:14:56,393 --> 02:14:58,701
Shut up!
- No! No!

2038
02:15:00,965 --> 02:15:03,435
Will you still take Sultana?

2039
02:15:03,693 --> 02:15:08,560
Rahim Shaikh,
even if I die, I'll take Sultana.

2040
02:15:10,380 --> 02:15:12,810
Cut him into pieces and throw him out!

2041
02:15:13,419 --> 02:15:14,393
No!

2042
02:15:15,232 --> 02:15:17,268
No! No!

2043
02:15:21,210 --> 02:15:22,210
Dawood, no!

2044
02:15:23,918 --> 02:15:28,001
To save my respect,
don't play with your life.

2045
02:15:30,054 --> 02:15:34,251
A courtesan's destiny
only has the courts.

2046
02:15:36,210 --> 02:15:40,130
Dawood, it is impossible
to get out of this court.

2047
02:15:40,210 --> 02:15:41,710
It is impossible!

2048
02:15:42,210 --> 02:15:44,043
It is impossible!

2049
02:15:47,357 --> 02:15:50,270
Did you hear? The girl is right!

2050
02:15:51,100 --> 02:15:53,102
The entrance to the brothel has fire,
once a girl steps on to it...

2051
02:15:53,185 --> 02:15:55,435
...her respect is burned away...

2052
02:15:55,644 --> 02:15:57,769
...and she becomes a prostitute,
and loses her respect.

2053
02:15:58,221 --> 02:16:00,721
Who builds these entrances
of such brothels?

2054
02:16:01,054 --> 02:16:04,054
Who lights up the fires on
those entrances? It's people like you!

2055
02:16:04,471 --> 02:16:07,763
You bring the decent girls
form their families to this brothels.

2056
02:16:07,888 --> 02:16:11,221
You take away their scarf from their
heads and tie the anklets to their feet.

2057
02:16:11,554 --> 02:16:14,346
This hell is made by you,
the fire too is lighted by you.

2058
02:16:14,763 --> 02:16:17,554
Even if I am to shed
my blood to put off this fire..

2059
02:16:17,638 --> 02:16:20,179
..then, I shall shed it, Rahim Shaikh!
I shall shed.

2060
02:16:20,346 --> 02:16:22,016
You talk a lot, really!

2061
02:16:22,096 --> 02:16:24,929
No, Rahim! No!
- Get away!

2062
02:16:25,832 --> 02:16:26,923
Sultana!

2063
02:16:31,531 --> 02:16:34,031
What man! What did you say?

2064
02:16:35,531 --> 02:16:36,948
You'll spill blood for her sake?

2065
02:16:37,698 --> 02:16:39,281
You'll take her from here?

2066
02:16:39,906 --> 02:16:41,031
Where will you take her to?

2067
02:16:41,865 --> 02:16:43,365
To the world of your decent ones?

2068
02:16:44,115 --> 02:16:48,865
Did you first tell them that
you are getting a courtesan as a wife?

2069
02:16:49,156 --> 02:16:54,323
These keepers of decency, these
society people are crueler than us.

2070
02:16:54,698 --> 02:16:57,365
Within 2 days they'll spit
on you and throw you'll out.

2071
02:16:57,448 --> 02:16:58,365
How will they throws out?

2072
02:16:59,865 --> 02:17:01,573
Let see who throws out.

2073
02:17:01,775 --> 02:17:02,816
Who is old woman?

2074
02:17:03,141 --> 02:17:04,403
I am Dawood's mother!

2075
02:17:04,788 --> 02:17:05,999
Sultana is my daughter in law.

2076
02:17:07,678 --> 02:17:09,619
Daughter in law?
- Look, Rahim Shaikh!

2077
02:17:09,829 --> 02:17:12,636
The society has come with
respect to take Sultana back home.

2078
02:17:12,716 --> 02:17:14,887
Yes, we all have come
to take Sultana back.

2079
02:17:15,150 --> 02:17:17,181
Yes, yes, we all have come...
- Shut up!

2080
02:17:19,080 --> 02:17:20,330
What's happening here?

2081
02:17:20,872 --> 02:17:22,163
What's the chaos here?

2082
02:17:22,538 --> 02:17:23,497
Son, Dawood, what happened?

2083
02:17:23,682 --> 02:17:24,703
How did this blood come?

2084
02:17:25,538 --> 02:17:26,747
Where's Sultana?
- There!

2085
02:17:26,830 --> 02:17:28,955
Hey! What's it? What's it?

2086
02:17:29,288 --> 02:17:30,747
We've come to take Sultana!

2087
02:17:30,830 --> 02:17:31,747
Your father's property?

2088
02:17:32,205 --> 02:17:34,580
You need to have 2 lakh rupees
if you want to take her. Do you have?

2089
02:17:34,788 --> 02:17:37,747
Mr., decent people neither
buy nor sell daughters.

2090
02:17:37,830 --> 02:17:39,747
Hey Decent! Seen this?

2091
02:17:39,830 --> 02:17:41,747
Keep this knife in your pocket.

2092
02:17:41,830 --> 02:17:44,288
I am not alone,
the entire neighborhood have come...

2093
02:17:44,372 --> 02:17:45,622
...to take Sultana.

2094
02:17:45,913 --> 02:17:50,497
When decent people get into beatings etc.,
even the heavens shiver.

2095
02:17:50,580 --> 02:17:54,038
For goons like you, even the
graveyards will not give shelter.

2096
02:17:54,705 --> 02:17:57,830
You people seem to
be from decent families.

2097
02:17:58,387 --> 02:18:00,913
But come to this place of sin,
hiding...

2098
02:18:00,997 --> 02:18:04,497
...form your wives and daughters to
strike deals with the downtrodden girls.

2099
02:18:04,912 --> 02:18:06,453
To see them being auctioned.

2100
02:18:06,912 --> 02:18:07,953
Such a shame!

2101
02:18:08,037 --> 02:18:10,787
If A goon like Rahim Shaikh brigs...

2102
02:18:10,870 --> 02:18:14,370
...your daughter, daughter in
law or wife, forcefully here, and...

2103
02:18:14,745 --> 02:18:18,995
...auctions her body in front of you,
what will you'll do?

2104
02:18:19,162 --> 02:18:20,703
Will you'll sit quietly?

2105
02:18:20,912 --> 02:18:22,078
Like a stage play?

2106
02:18:22,787 --> 02:18:25,287
Or, will you'll see her being auctioned,
with a glass in your hand?

2107
02:18:25,699 --> 02:18:27,537
There won't be glass
in the hands, sir.

2108
02:18:27,731 --> 02:18:28,912
Catch! Catch! Catch!

2109
02:18:29,131 --> 02:18:30,788
There will be handcuffs.

2110
02:18:31,680 --> 02:18:33,162
Hey! Constable, take him away!

2111
02:18:33,323 --> 02:18:34,995
His dance will happen in the jail.

2112
02:18:35,078 --> 02:18:37,120
Take him away!
Go! Go!

2113
02:18:38,982 --> 02:18:41,120
Partner, today our
story has been completed!

2114
02:18:41,203 --> 02:18:43,287
I was looking for
a climax for the story.

2115
02:18:43,370 --> 02:18:44,745
It was a happy ending today.

2116
02:18:45,305 --> 02:18:47,620
Happy ending? What's all this blood?

2117
02:18:48,589 --> 02:18:49,881
What's this sad scene?

2118
02:18:50,714 --> 02:18:52,589
What happened to this
Sister in law, Sultana?

2119
02:18:53,131 --> 02:18:54,756
Open your eyes, Sultana!

2120
02:18:55,584 --> 02:18:58,131
Look who all have come to take you!

2121
02:18:58,339 --> 02:19:01,714
Sultana,
we have come to take you home.

2122
02:19:01,974 --> 02:19:04,547
Yes, we have come to take you home.

2123
02:19:07,538 --> 02:19:08,839
Home?

2124
02:19:09,916 --> 02:19:11,082
Home?

2125
02:19:11,584 --> 02:19:13,624
Sister in law, come home, please!

2126
02:19:14,329 --> 02:19:17,749
Sister in law? Sister in law?

2127
02:19:17,951 --> 02:19:19,541
Get up, daughter! Get up!

2128
02:19:28,772 --> 02:19:31,666
Sultana, your awaiting has ended!

2129
02:19:33,392 --> 02:19:34,916
Your prayer has been accepted!

2130
02:19:35,255 --> 02:19:36,797
Congratulations to your new life,
daughter!

2131
02:19:36,880 --> 02:19:41,088
Congratulations!
