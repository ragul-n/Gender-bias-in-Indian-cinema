1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,650
The weather outside is 32 degrees

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,700
From all of us here l say good bye

3
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,600
We hope your flight was relaxing

4
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,150
Are you coming tonight?

5
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,950
Where?
-Don't you remember today is Kavita's birthday party

6
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,150
lf my sister is well than l will come
-Okay

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,550
The plant you gave last time grew
beautiful flowers

8
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,550
Here you go

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,950
What are you doing?

10
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,600
Taking money

11
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,300
Don't take this money, my medicine
is finished

12
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
So what should l do?

13
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,800
l have no money to bet on the race
and you want medicine

14
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,050
l told you many times

15
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,900
Store at home brings in less customers

16
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,800
lf on the street, all the plants will
be sold in one day

17
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,300
You can get your medicine and l can
do my work

18
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,950
l'm sick, you should think of something

19
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,150
l always think that's why l bet on the race

20
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,800
Just let me get the jackpot all
the worries will be over

21
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,300
l will get your operation done
-Brother in law

22
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,050
You should ashamed, she's ill and you
want to bet on the race

23
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
What do you care if l bet or get a horse

24
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,900
Don't lecture me, l'm already stressed

25
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,250
What stress d o you have?

26
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,650
l have a lot of stress on my head

27
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,450
For 6 months my horse didn't win and
l have take care of the expenses

28
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,400
Expenses for the house and your
sisters medicine

29
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,150
You're the only one in the house that works

30
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,550
All the others just sit and eat

31
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,050
The bitch stands in my house and mocks me

32
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,350
l pay for your expenses too

33
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,700
l give you 2000 rupees every month

34
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,150
Every month, today is the 10th of the month

35
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,900
Where is my money?

36
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,850
l was on a flight

37
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,500
And don't talk to me like that

38
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,950
So why don't you take the money out and
throw it in my face

39
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,250
And bring didi's medicine

40
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Your telling me like you gave the money
for the medicine too

41
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,450
This is for the house expense

42
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,150
lf l buy medicine, how will l
pay the bills

43
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,100
Now l can get the medicine
and the jackpot

44
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,050
He doesn't think of anything
but the race

45
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,250
Every time is race. Why don't
you talk to him

46
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,150
What should l tell him. This
is my fate now

47
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,800
Don't blame fate

48
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,700
The truth is one wrong step ruins
a persons whole life

49
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,400
My name is Vijay Agnihothory

50
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,300
You probably don't know...

51
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,450
...all the girls that here...

52
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,700
...they come here thinking that l
will dance with them

53
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,350
But l thought today l will give you
this chance

54
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,600
Come lets go

55
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,250
We'll go there too but...

56
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,650
What is this non sense
-Nonsense?

57
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,300
l thought its not your birthday nor
hers so l would celebrate mine

58
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,600
You have some too, its very good

59
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,850
You know its your birthday today
-Yes

60
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,150
That fool never ate a cake like
that before

61
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,950
Than what happened?

62
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,150
When l got there, the car was still burning

63
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,900
The 3 stores around it also got burned

64
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,650
Do you know how much that car is?

65
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,150
lf you sell the car as is, you can get
enough to get new stores

66
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,650
What about the complaint the made

67
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,350
l don't know anything, here

68
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,350
Give it to the store owners

69
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,950
And this?
-You come

70
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
This show of money that you always do...

71
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,350
...l don't like this at all

72
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,300
A person shows what he has

73
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Just look at him now

74
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,950
He has this uniform

75
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,150
Which gave him enough strength to come here

76
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,850
And we have money

77
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,450
Which gives us power to shut this
officer and the store owner's mouth

78
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,400
Okay l'm going to the office

79
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,850
What is all this?

80
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,500
There is not even one girl that
can become a model

81
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,850
Looking at them seems like there
are no beauties in lndia

82
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,400
These are very famous models

83
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,800
l don't need famous l need beautiful

84
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,800
l want this girl

85
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,250
These are air hostesses that don't
work outside their own company

86
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,500
Money can make anything happen

87
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,900
l need her address

88
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,750
Here is you tea

89
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,600
You?
-At least you recognised me

90
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,300
How can l forget your face

91
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,050
Now you will never forget the
name either

92
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,450
The only owner of Agnihothory
Group of lndustries

93
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,250
But what brings you here?

94
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,050
To give you good news

95
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,400
l have chosen you as a model
for our new product

96
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,100
So you made the decision that l will model

97
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,700
So you probably like to make money

98
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,800
lts just paper to me but they
can turn any no into a yes

99
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,100
Really?
-lf this is not enough l have more

100
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,900
You have that much pride
in your money

101
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,600
Not pride but proud just like
you are of your beauty

102
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,600
And you came to bid on my beauty

103
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,200
Think what ever you want

104
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,100
But l need your answer

105
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,900
l don't have a better answer than that

106
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,500
You're a spoiled rich kid
which l knew that day...

107
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,550
...but your also rude an
obnoxious, l know that now

108
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,500
Which girl are you going after

109
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,300
She is the number one fool

110
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,600
What does she know what money is

111
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,550
She just kicked her future away

112
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
You look like a fool but
your very smart

113
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,750
l am very smart

114
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,850
You need a model.
What wrong with me?

115
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,250
My teeth only stick out but
that can be fixed

116
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,300
Give me 10000 rupees and l
will get them fixed

117
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,050
l can put your teeth in without
any money

118
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,050
You cant even do a right thing now a days

119
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,250
The talk l had with the London Star
Export...

120
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,100
All the details from that are in this file

121
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,300
Just go over them
-l will read it on the plane

122
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,600
This is a very good deal but it must
be in our terms

123
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,800
What ever l do, l do in my own terms

124
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,250
Where is this crew going?

125
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,150
They are going to Dubai

126
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,950
So change my ticket for London to Dubai

127
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,550
This is not a Air lndia ticket.
l can't change this

128
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,300
Okay than give me an Air lndia
ticket to Dubai

129
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,600
You?
-Yes me

130
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,200
What are you doing here?

131
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,350
l came here to play cricket

132
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,800
This flight is going to Dubai and
that's where l'm going

133
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,400
l need a drink. Can l get it

134
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,300
The drink should be strong

135
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,750
lt should be spicy like your tongue

136
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,900
And salty like you

137
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,700
Very strong...

138
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,400
...spicier than my tongue...

139
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,100
...and saltier than me

140
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,650
lts very good

141
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,750
Do you like it?

142
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,050
Of course l can l not

143
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,300
You made it with such love

144
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Really its very good

145
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,400
l want another one like this

146
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,750
Exactly like this?
-No this one didn't have enough salt

147
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,900
You're here again?

148
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Why did l commit a crime
-You just came to Dubai 2 hours ago

149
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,600
Now your going to back to Bombay

150
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,750
ls there a law saying l cant go
back on the same flight

151
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,450
Sit on your seat, we are
experiencing bad weather

152
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,550
Didn't you hear the weather is
bad sit on your seat

153
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,100
You stay quite and sit

154
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,150
Have a seat, when the weather is
better l will make you a drink

155
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,650
l don't drink anyone's made drink

156
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,350
You just dropped everything

157
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,650
Who are you to stop me if a break
a bottle or a glass

158
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,100
You're here as a servant.
So stay like one

159
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,700
Your very rude

160
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,800
Don't you know how to take to a lady

161
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,300
You bought a ticket not us

162
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,800
We are here to serve you not to
take your rude behaviour

163
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,800
Apologize to her

164
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,200
And now sit down quitely

165
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,900
lt's a small wound

166
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,800
lf a person is hurt they will scream

167
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
The bandage came off

168
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,450
Come fix it, l'm going to die

169
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,850
Are you okay now?

170
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Mr. Bhattia is selling
his Delhi factory

171
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,750
lt will be good for us if
we buy it

172
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,200
That's fine but l will have
to talk to Vijay

173
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,300
And he will be back from
London after one week

174
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,400
You didn't go to London?
-No

175
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,600
Just because

176
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,900
What happened?
-l bumped into some one

177
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,500
l got hurt

178
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,200
What is this foolishness

179
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,200
Who is the girl
-Remember when l was young l used to sing a song

180
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,100
l have found that star

181
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,500
And what if that star becomes
your daughter in law

182
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,650
Than all my wishes will come true

183
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,450
But the star must have a name

184
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,050
lt's a very nice name

185
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
When will l meet her?
-When ever you say

186
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
There is one problem

187
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,500
She is an ordinary air hostess

188
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,000
That's okay after the wedding
she will be my daughter in law

189
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,100
Than lets go right now

190
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,450
You shouldn't go empty handed

191
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,800
l will call the pundit and get a day

192
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,800
Mr. Vijay, you. This is your mother?

193
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,700
There was no use for this present,
but we will take it

194
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,250
What is going on?
-Shivani is getting married

195
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,200
l don't like this at all

196
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,900
The guy is a pilot

197
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Forget about Shivani

198
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,050
Time heals all wounds

199
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,150
Everything will be okay

200
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,900
You should go to London for a few days

201
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
You will feel better

202
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,900
l will go check in

203
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,200
l will call you everyday

204
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,300
l want to see my son happy

205
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Where are you going?

206
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,600
Where are you going?
-Me, why are you joking with me

207
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,100
Where am l going to go

208
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,250
Shivani is going to New York
with her husband

209
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,950
They have been posted there for 4 years

210
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,350
There leaving, l have to go

211
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,100
What is this file for?

212
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,900
We had an agreement with Star Export
London for 5 years...

213
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,300
...which expires this year

214
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,200
These are renewal papers

215
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,900
We need Vijay's signature on these too

216
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,600
He is not here
-Where did he go?

217
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,950
He has changed so much in these 4 years

218
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,150
l don't know why he is so mad
with his life

219
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,300
You should get him married

220
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,400
That's what l want. Maybe than
he will love life

221
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,700
There is a deer in the car, you
can cook it and eat it

222
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,650
Why do you kill innocent animals?

223
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,450
l like it

224
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Stay at home tonight

225
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,450
Mr. Sharma and his daughter are
coming for dinner

226
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,550
Tonight there is a party at the
Commissioners house

227
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,250
lt is important that l go

228
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,950

00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:37,850
That's why you must meet...
-l told you many times l don't want to be married

232
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,800
So why do you keep talking to people

233
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,050
l don't want to hear anything. Go
to the party but come early

234
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,000
l would've been upset if you didn't come

235
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,300
This party is only for you

236
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,850

237
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,250
Where is Shivani?
-She is probably with Geeta

00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,200
She is not there
-She must be here somewhere

239
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,150
Sorry you have to wait so long
-That's okay

240
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,300
But you should learn to wait
from now daughter

241
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,150
Usually he comes early. l don't know why...

242

Do you know how to dance? Dance

251
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,250
You will never understand

252
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,600
Tell all your friends to come to
your birthday party

253
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,700
Pinky hurry up

254
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,200

l'm getting late. l have to go
to the hospital

259
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,500
l don't understand this at all

260
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:21,250
You quite air hostess after marriage

261
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,300
You go on your flight and
Pinky goes to school

262
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,250
l get bored all by myself

263
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,600
And l'm not doing this for money

264
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,300
There is so much peace helping
the handicapped

265
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,050
The best in the world

266
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,700
They're humans but life played a
horrible joke on them

267
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,200
Look at them closely. What are
they lacking?

268
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,400
Only that his brain has no control
over his body

269
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,200
They also want to laugh and
talk like others

270
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:03,200
But they are unable to. They just
look at people with quite eyes

271
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,550
There is only one cure, affection,
hope and courage

272
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,900
How are you Vicky?

273
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,700

Now he is so active

276
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,700
lf he is loved like this he will
be walking in no time

277
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,400

279

357
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,850
l need to launch my airline
very soon

358
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,150
lt's not a small thing to
launch an airline

359
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,750
We need a person to take care of it

360
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,100
You handle your duties

361
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:26,050
Where the person is concerned
to take care of the airline....

362
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,650
...l have one

363
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:33,000
l going to die. l'm so thirsty,
when is the moon coming out?

364
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,700
There is no point in fating abroad

365
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
The lord is in lndia

366
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:40,450
He doesn't have a passport
that he will come here

367
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,650
Your always joking. l'm so hungry

368
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:47,600
Will the lord accept you breaking
your fast in front of a different moon

369
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,150
Listen, do one thing...

370
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,750
...they are showing the moon on T.V

371
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,750
Just watch that and break your fast

372
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,850
l'm going to call Pinky, if you
see the moon than call me

373
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,150
Where is the moon gone?

374
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:14,150
lt comes everyday, where
is it stuck today?

375
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,050
lts out. Ashok come quick
the moon is out

376
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,600
Stay there. After the moon
l am going to look at you

377
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,200
Why did Vijay come here?
-But what happened?

378
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:59,000
l dropped the plate as
soon as l saw him

379
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,200
You know how bad that is

380
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,100
What is he doing here?

381
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,250
l'm sorry l disturbed you

382
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,150
NO what are you saying?

383
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,100
You know how women are

384
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,450
And she only dropped the dish

385
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Any ways you tell me

386
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:23,250
You know how little time is
left before the launch of the airline

387
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:27,550
So if l waited for you to sign
the agreement, 5 or 6 days would be gone

388
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:34,250
So better than that would be
that l come myself and get it signed

389
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,150
Here, read it carefully

390
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,300
l have thought of giving
you 1 million a month

391
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,850
ls that too less?

392
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,650
Read it carefully it
must be 1000

393
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:54,450
No its 1 million
-There must be some clause in it

394
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,900
l don't know what crazy
your following

395
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,850
Listen to me and rip
up the agreement

396
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,350
Why you after the poor guy?

397
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,600
l don't know why you
despise him

398
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,750
l hate his face

399
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:13,350
Okay l will tell him never
to show you his face

400
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,600
Shall we read on
-No you read it

401
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,800
l am making Ashok my general manager

402
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,900
Are you happy?
-No

403
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,600
Why?
-You asked me and l said no

404
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:34,350
lt's not necessary that l
answer every question

405
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,450
What is your problem with me?

406
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,950
Tell me l'll fix it

407
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,200
Your problem has no cure

408
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,650
There is a cure for everything...

409
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:48,050
...like hospital for the handicapped,
nut house for the crazy

410
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,500
But there is nothing for fools

411
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,900
And you are a fool

412
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,850
How did you know?

413
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,400
A fool needs no introduction

414
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:02,250
He tells with his behaviour
that he is a fool

415
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:05,350
And you prove it every time
you open your mouth

416
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,850
At least you think of me
as something

417
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,950
But l'd like to tell you
something else

418
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,900
l am very stubborn

419
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,800
And there is no cure for that either

420
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,650
Wow your good

421
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:22,150
Oh and you can get all of
them on bulls eye

422
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,400
Would you like to bet on it?

423
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,650
You will lose

424
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,600
l never lose

425
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,050
What is this? Stop it

426
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,250
What do you mean stop it?

427
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,350
We haven't even started yet

428
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,900
Not inside, go out

429
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,200
Did l come to stay here?

430
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:39,050
lf you keep me like that
than l will stay

431
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,450
Let me go

432
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,050
Money , give me money

433
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:58,050
For Diwali
-There is still time till that

434
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:00,350
So give it for Holi
-Your not getting any money

435
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,850
You had a child
-l don't have a child

436
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:07,050
You cant have one
-What are you blabbing?

437
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
Lets go he is stingy

438
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,200
Wait

439
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,300
What did you do in my room

440
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:30,300
We went to see the baby
-Went to see the baby?

441
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,800
Show me your hands. This
is the baby

442
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,100
You came here to steal

443
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,400
l'm going to call the police

444
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:39,800
No don't do that

445
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,500
Don't call them? Take that off

446
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:45,250
l cant take these out
-Not that, the necklace

447
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,900
This is mine
-l don't care take it off

448
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,350
He's a bigger crook than us

449
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
There is no one here

450
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:01,200
Why are you locking up this
beautiful house?

451
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,850
This is the city, anyone can break in

452
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,600
Than we will have to go to court

453
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,550
lt's better if l just stay here

454
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:13,350
Lets go

455
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:19,700
Don't we wait for Shanti
-She will bring Shivani straight to the new house

456
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,600
l'll do that

457
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:31,350
What a beautiful house, better
than the old one

458
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,800
Just start living here from tomorrow

459
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:38,200
We went to the doctor and there
is good news

460
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,100
Your going to be a dad

461
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,650
We'll leave. Take care of Shivani

462
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:57,800
lt's a big house, they will be scared,
we will stay here

463
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:04,350
l'm going to take Pinky to my
house from school

464
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:10,900
Our son is so lucky. l got a good job,
house and happiness

465
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,900
How do you know its going to be a boy?

466
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Your asking me this?

467
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,250
l will tell you right now

468
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,200
Son, this is your father

469
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,400
What did you say? One minute

470
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:34,050
He says to take care of you
till he comes

471
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,250
And give you lots of love

472
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:04,750
Mr. Vijay, you?

473
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,550
l shouldn't have come like that

474
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:12,450
l thought l would ask you how you
like the house?

475
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,300
ls there anything missing?

476
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:19,200
The designs for the publicity
are also ready

477
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:19,550
Have a look

478
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,350
l'm sure you will like them

479
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:27,900
Shivani's picture?

480
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,900
You don't like it?

481
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,850
l saw her picture in an ad
before too

482
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,850
lf you don't like it l will change it

483
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,850
Get out from here

484
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:51,650
What is this?

485
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,300
How dare he use my picture

486
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:57,350
lts just a design. Nothing has
been printed yet

487
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:59,200
And they are telling you they
will change it

488
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:00,700
We will not stay in this house
-What nonsense is this?

489
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:04,200
You have to leave this job
-Where will l get a salary like that?

490
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:06,050
Don't yell
-l will yell as much as l want

491
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,700
What will l do if l leave this job

492
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:14,150
What do you need? What are you going
to do with all that money?

493
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,900
l make this money for you and the kids

494
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:19,800
You need money. You leave this job
and l will make money

495
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,100
l'm leaving this house

496
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:40,600
Stop Shivani

497
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,700
lf you leave, don't ever come back

498
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
Did you hit Shivani?

499
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,200
What are you doing here?

500
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,800
Did you hit her?

501
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:17,400
This is personal, you have
no right to interfere

502
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,750
You hit Shivani

503
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,250
Why did you hit her?
Why?

504
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:36,900
As you said he had no enemies,
there is only one reason...

505
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:41,550
Robbery. Some one came and
Ashok tried stopping him

506
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,450
And that's how he was injured

507
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,550
l shouldn't have left him alone

508
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:58,300
He is unconscious and will be on oxygen.
One you may stay with him

509
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,100
Okay than l will leave

510
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:07,150
lnform me as soon as he
gains consciousness

511
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,400
l need to take his statement

512
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
You go home to Pinky

513
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:16,950
Come in the morning

514
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,200
Please go away form here

515
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:15,750
There is no one in this world
who hasn't made a mistake

516
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,950
But those people are smart
who admit it

517
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,350
l have brought these papers

518
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,700
Just sign them

519
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
What kind of papers?

520
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,700
Divorce papers

521
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,450
l have talked with the lawyer

522
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,600
Just sign this and than marry me

523
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:46,850
What did you say?

524
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,200
Have you lost your mind?

525
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
Have you gone crazy?

526
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:51,650
Yes l'm crazy

527
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,350
Your love has made me crazy

528
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,300
Get out of here right away

529
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,100
He doesn't respect you

530
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,400
He hit you. Forget about him

531
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:06,600
And marry me

532
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,900
You think l would leave
Ashok for you?

533
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:17,650
Just because he gave you sindoor,
you are his forever

534
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:21,650
lt may be nothing to you, but
to a wife its priceless

535
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
Try to understand me

536
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,150
Forget him and marry me

537
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:33,400
A women only marries once and
that bonds forever

538
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,100
Which no one can break

539
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:47,950
No one can break it

540
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:03,600
The things you said to me,
even god wont forgive you

541
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:07,900
Don't you feel shame talking
to a married women like that?

542
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,200
l am a wife. l am a wife

543
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:14,400
And now?

544
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:22,600
No. No Ashok

545
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:03,000
Sir, the inspector would
like to see you

546
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,950
What is it?
-You must know Ashok Chopra

547
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:09,400
Yes l do

548
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:11,900
He has passed away

549
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,600
And his wife says you killed him

550
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
What are you saying?

551
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,850
l would kill him?

552
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:22,850
What is going on?

553
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,050
Ashok Chopra has died

554
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:32,050
He came to tell me that
Shivani blames me

555
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:35,450
Why?
-That's what l'm trying to say. Why would l?

556
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:40,150
lnstead l have lost the most
with his death

557
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:44,000
Our new air line is going
to be launched

558
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:45,550
Everything is ready and l was
very dependant on him

559
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,700
She says you came at 1 1 pm
-What?

560
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,650
What time did you say?
-At 1 1 pm

561
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:01,100
But between 9 and 1 1 :30 l was
having dinner with one officer

562
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,850
Which officer?
-lnspector Arjun Singh

563
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:11,550
He is lying

564
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:15,150
l'm telling the truth, he
killed my husband

565
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:19,550
But the doctor report shows
he died a natural death

566
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,650
He died because of loss of breath

567
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:27,350
That's what l'm saying. Vijay
removed the oxygen mask from his face

568
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:33,100
First you say he murdered him than
you say he removed the mask

569
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:37,400
At the time of the death Vijay was
having dinner with me at my house

570
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:43,500
How is it possible for him to eat
dinner and kill him at the same time

571
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,050
l'm telling the truth

572
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,250
Why don't you believe me?

573
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:58,050
l swear on my child that he is the o
ne who killed my husband

574
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,450
l beg you to bring me justice

575
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:11,900
She is just acting

576
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:20,750
l believe that Vijay was eating
dinner at your house...

577
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:24,100
...but why is she keep saying
Vijay's name

578
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:27,550
Because she cant get anything
if she says our names

579
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:30,250
What do you mean?
-l know this lady very well

580
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:34,850
Even though she was married,
she had an affair with Vijay

581
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:38,600
She always asked him for money
and he kept giving it

582
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:42,150
A few days ago he refused to
give her money

583
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:47,050
She thought this is the perfect
chance for him to save himself and give her money

584
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,100
Now do you understand?

585
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:54,750
Leave these stories and let me
buy you a mouth freshner

586
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,850
This time you got saved because of me

587
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,700
But what ever you did wasn't right

588
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
Can l say something?

589
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
Forget about Shivani

590
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,900
You said it now but never say it again

591
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,300
l have only loved one girl

592
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:30,950
Her name is Shivani

593
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,150
She will never be yours

594
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,050
When l was younger...

595
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,550
...there was a girl in my class

596
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,300
She had a very pretty doll

597
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:57,500
l liked it very much and l asked
for it many times

598
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,350
But she never gave it to me

599
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,150
Do you know what l did?

600
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:12,500
l broke it

601
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:25,050
l will bring you new toys every
day Pinky

602
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:29,050
But now don't call me uncle, call me papa

603
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,800
Your not my papa
-Now l am your papa

604
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:36,450
Come here

605
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:05,200
You murderer how dare you come
here. Get out

606
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:09,750
Don't get upset

607
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,150
l brought you something

608
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,550
Look. You wanted sindoor right?

609
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,200
Here put it on your head

610
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:23,550
You bastard

611
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:29,350
You're the one who said its
priceless for wives

612
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:32,750
Be a wife again

613
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,700
This white dress doesn't suite you

614
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:40,200
Do you know the meaning of this
white dress?

615
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:42,450
lt means a man and wife's
relationship is so pure

616
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:46,150
This is not just a dress but a
jewel for me

617
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,900
But you cant spend your life like that

618
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:53,000
lt's hard to survive in this world alone

619
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,650
l have the memories of my husband

620
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:00,200
My kids. And that's enough for
one life time

621
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,400
But l cant see you like this

622
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
l love you very much

623
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,500
lts not love but just a desire

624
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:21,850
What did you say?

625
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:23,700
Just a desire?

626
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:24,500
Yes desire

627
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:32,700
Don't say that

628
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,050
Please don't say that

629
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:41,750
My love is true

630
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
Don't insult my love

631
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,900
Just tell me once that you love me too

632
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:50,500
l hate you

633
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:54,250
Just say it once
-You bastard get out of here

634
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,450
You will die a horrible death

635
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,200
Say that you love me too

636
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:37,800
l am begging you

637
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
Just say you love me

638
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,600
l'm calling from block number 18

639
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,450
Some one is about to die here

640
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:39,850
Please come quick

641
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:34,700
What happened?

642
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,200
Shivani tried to kill me

643
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
l didn't do anything

644
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,600
What court is Shivani's case in?

645
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:02,400
Number 2

646
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:08,850
He's the biggest crook. l got 3
years your going to get 5

647
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,050
Shut up. Handcuff him

648
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:33,400
Be quite

649
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,050
Where are the papers?

650
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:37,800
What's his name?

651
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:43,250
Send a drum in this time or
else we get bored

652
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,650
Our life is nothing without drums

653
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:48,400
Be quite

654
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,400
This is a very romantic case

655
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:53,300
Should l put him in with the
men or the women?

656
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:56,650
The name is Champa Chambeli so
the women jail is fine

657
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:00,750
What am l going to do there.
They wont even let me clap

658
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,250
Fine put him with the men

659
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:05,550
Men? Me alone, and so many
men what if l get raped?

660
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:08,550
l am single

661
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,900
So than where?
-Shall l take her home?

662
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:16,450
Yes, he wont get bored and l
will be with the law

663
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,650
Be quite
-You're doing very wrong

664
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,700
My friend, l cant live
without you

665
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:28,800
Take us with you

666
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:32,100
My love is with you. lt's
only for 2 years

667
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,950
Keep track of all weddings and holidays

668
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,500
l will check it when l get out

669
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:49,900
Constable. Hold me

670
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:56,000
Vijay was cut up and Shivani
was holding a knife -You can go

671
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:04,150
The jury should know criminal
offence is caused by past tragedy

672
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:11,750
l'd like Vijay to come to
the stand -Permission granted

673
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:49,000
l'll say the truth nothing
but the truth

674
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:54,300
Do you recognize the women
infront of you -Yes

675
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:58,150
That's Shivani Choopra
Ashok Choopra's wife

676
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:02,200
How long have you known her
-About 5-6 years

677
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:07,550
Ashok was just a pilot, why
did you make him the GM

678
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:12,950
Shivani asked me to

679
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,650
What's your relationship
with her

680
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,200
We had a sexual relation

681
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,250
Don't lie! Tell the truth

682
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:36,000
Can you now tell us why
she attacked you

683
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:44,250
You have to make-up for the
mistakes you make

684
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,800
l made a mistake by meeting
this hoe

685
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,900
l went to her house
when she called me

686
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,400
She had sindoor in her hands

687
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,750
And told me to marry her
right away

688
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,100
How am l to marry her?

689
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,300
lf she could sleep with me

690
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,600
She could sleep with anyone else

691
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:31,150
A women like that can never
be with one man

692
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,200
l told her no right away

693
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,400
Then she picked up the knife

694
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,250
And attacked me -Bastard!

695
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,050
l'm going to kill you

696
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:53,050
Due to the evidence the court
has decided

697
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:59,450
That Shivani will be charged
for attempted murder

698
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:04,150
She will be sentenced for 3
years in prison

699
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,100
No don't do this to me

700
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,950
l didn't do anything wrong
l'm innocent

701
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:21,350
l beg of you, your punishing
my daugther not me

702
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,350
She already lost her father

703
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,300
Don't take her mother away

704
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,400
A mother is begging for pity

705
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,650
Don't punish my daugther for this

706
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:52,700
Were's mother?

707
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:57,100
She's coming.
-She's sentenced for 3 years

708
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:58,700
What? -3 years

709
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:11,850
Pick me up mother

710
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,450
Why aren't you talking to me?

711
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:26,950

l'll take your eye's and throw
them in your hands

722
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:22,000
Stop screaming, no one can even
breath without my permission

723
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:27,250
lf you try anything wrong

724
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,100
Do you see this stick?

725
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:33,800

728
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,300
So you won't take them off

729
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:55,800
Didn't you feel any shame taking
them off for your lover

730
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:13,450
Don't cry

731
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:18,050
There's no one here to feel
sorry for you

732
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,300
What you get punished for?

733
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,350
For something l havn't done

734
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,550
This is how it's supposed to be

735
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,100
Take me for an example

736
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:38,750
My mother-in-law and husband
tried to kill me for money

737
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,100
l tried to save myself

738
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,850
But my mother in law died
in the fire

739
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,350
And now l got life sentence

740
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,900
God wrote trouble in every
womens life

741
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,700
God didn't write sarrow in my
life

742
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:02,850
A person wrote it

743
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,700
He killed my husband infront
of me

744
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:16,050
He blamed me and proved that
l was a hore

745
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,500
l screamed but nobody heard me

746
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,300
Money made the police deaf

747
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:26,950
Why? What did l do?

748
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:32,450
What did my daugther do?
to get seperated from me

749
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,100
Where's your daugther?

750
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,000

Eat daugther, take the house

Mrs.Rupali charges 1 lak, but she's
not charging us for this show

Uncle took my neckless from

01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:15,250
Does he not have humanity

773
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,250
He's worse then an animal

774
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:21,300
Didn't his hands tremble when
he pulled it off

775
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:29,750
Who cares, l'll get you another one

776

Are you Shivani? -Yes, but

875
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:30,400
Your sister and daugther got

She's not going to lie down

She can't even stay quiet,
she's a devil

892
01:53:57,000 --> 01:54:00,400
lt's somebody elses child, and
you say it's mine

No, you got to live for you
husbands last mark

900
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:19,600
A widow never stays a widow

My daugther

01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:40,900
The child that hears her
mothers cries

905
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:45,500
l'm going to beg god for
a son

906
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:52,400
He has to burn those who
burned his mothers life

907
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:58,750
What? l have to go to the
mens jail

908
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:04,400
l wish l could help you
-All you do is take help

909
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:09,750
Someone complained that you beat
innocent women in jail

910
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:15,250
And you sell there bodies

911
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:16,750
Who complained?

912
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:20,500

913
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:25,250

Don't you dare complain
about me again

924
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:34,550
lf anyone complains this is
what will happen to you

925
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:57,750
ls Chumpa not her, -Why's you
send her to the mens jail

926
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:05,050
l'm back in this jail

927
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:10,800
Good thing your here, they
always send me back and forth

928
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:17,500
No officer ever did this
to me

929
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:22,650
l had just about enough
l'm going to win the election

930
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:29,400
l'm going to delhi, l'm
going to become a leader

931
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:34,450
Are you a leader? -l've
learned how to become one

932
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:42,450
How do people become leaders?

933
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:50,500
When l get power l'm going to
take her out of duty

934
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:55,850
Ladies, grab them

935
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:58,600
l have a meeting so lock
them up

936
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:16,450
l've achieved a man like from
Shivani complaining

937
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:21,850
Now l know why these big men
want you

938
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:27,350
What did you do to Shivani?

939
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:21,500
What happend? -Don't cry Nisha

940
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:28,100
Look at my eyes, you won't even
see a tear

941
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:35,750
My blood dried up and that's how
my tears have dried up

942
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:43,700
Dry these tears that makes
us weak

943
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:52,800
You know why women get pushed
around

944
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:57,100
Because we can take it

945
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:01,550
The world doesn't know women
are as strong as earth

946
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:06,000
We can take anything

947
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:10,450
But when they cross the line
they'll be destroyed

948
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:17,200
l've seen a mother, sister and
daugthers view, but not a killers

949
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:25,450
Criminals want to pray to god

950
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:29,600
First they sin, then they repent

951
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:32,750
Shall l stop it
-No l can't do that

952
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:40,650
Keep an eye on them, l don't
want anyone running away

953
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:47,450
Send Shivani to me, l have
important guest coming

02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:17,600
Yes l know, people like you

l'll teach you a lesson that
you'll forget

963
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:12,350
lt's important to stay alive
to remember things

964
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:15,400
And your never going to live

965
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:17,350
l'll kill you -Stop yelling

966
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:21,850
You told me nobody's aloud to
breath without your concent

967
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:27,000
Today l'll be telling you when
to breath

968
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:31,900
Hore selling women

969
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:35,450
This unifor doesn't look good
on you take it off!

970
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:55,650
l know that you killed
the jailer

971
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:01,600
Don't hit her, she sat beside
me during the ceremony

972
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:16,550
The commissioner is calling you

973
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:29,550
Your right, l killed the jailer

974
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:35,500
But you can't do nothing to me

975
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:40,550
l didn't have evidence that Vijay
killed my husband

976
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:47,500
Just like you have no evidence
l killed the jailer

977
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:54,750
Go, the commissioner is calling you

978
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:28,500

02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:47,100
Your getting out today

980
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:51,450
Were are you going from here?

981
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:55,850
Past these four walls is not
the city

982
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:04,150
lt's bloody war, and l have
to seek revenge

983
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:19,250
What are you going to do?

984
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:23,100
l'm going to pay my brother
in law a visit

985
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:29,700

986
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:51,000
Why'd you come here?

Get out, your sister & daugther

That's why l've come here

989
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:05,900
Why should you live if my
family died?

990
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:11,050
You'll have to die to

991
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:23,300
Your going to kill me
-Yes

992
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:29,000

993
02:12:31,000 --> 02:12:32,800

Here take this and eat it

1000
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:37,050
Seems to me the person wanted
to kill him

1001
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:44,550
No one took the money
-And they didn't use a weapon

1002
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:54,350
Find out if Shivani has been
released from jail

1003
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:03,300
No one came from there household
the child was to young to cremate

1004
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:08,900
Where? -Over there

1005

That's the same girls grave

02:21:05,000 --> 02:21:07,150
Who do you want to see?

1013
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:10,650
Vijay Nehotri

1014
02:21:11,000 --> 02:21:14,850
He doesn't live here, there's
only Vakash that lives here

1015
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:20,000
But he lived here? -We've been

We've got alot of opions from

02:35:25,000 --> 02:35:26,850
She's to innocent

1058
02:35:27,000 --> 02:35:30,450
She's doesn't know that you
did yourself a favour

1059
02:35:35,000 --> 02:35:38,650
All your paths has been destroyed
but one, that is me

1060
02:35:44,000 --> 02:35:46,100
Your all alone Shivani

1061
02:35:49,000 --> 02:35:51,800
Now lady can live her life
all alone

1062
02:35:56,000 --> 02:35:58,200
Just tell me you love me

1063
02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:02,400
l'm still ready to marry you

1064
02:36:07,000 --> 02:36:09,100
You gave me a new life

1065
02:36:10,000 --> 02:36:12,750
lt's my duty to give you a
new life

1066
02:36:14,000 --> 02:36:16,300
Just tell me once you love

1067
02:37:23,000 --> 02:37:26,400
Yes, l gave you a new life so
l can take it back

1068
02:37:32,000 --> 02:37:35,150
lf a women can love, then she
can also hate

1069
02:37:39,000 --> 02:37:42,300
lf anything gets in the way
it'll be destroyed

1070
02:37:44,000 --> 02:37:47,450
lf a women can gives life,
then she can take life

1071
02:38:05,000 --> 02:38:07,900
Remember how badly you hurt
my husband

1072
02:38:10,000 --> 02:38:13,300
Remember how you seperated my
daugther from me

1073
02:38:16,000 --> 02:38:18,550
Remember how you ruined my life

1074
02:38:21,000 --> 02:38:24,850
This anger will always stick to
my chest until l kill you

1075
02:38:28,000 --> 02:38:31,650
lf you wanted to kill me why'd
you give me a new life

1076
02:38:35,000 --> 02:38:38,600
You could have killed me easily
when l was paralized

1077
02:38:42,000 --> 02:38:45,250
Yes l could have, but what
would l say to God

1078
02:38:46,000 --> 02:38:48,450
That l killed a paralized man

1079
02:38:48,000 --> 02:38:51,950
lt's a sin to kill paralized
men, but lt's okay to kill you

1080
02:39:02,000 --> 02:39:04,450
Just tell me once you love me

1081
02:39:22,000 --> 02:39:24,500
l'm not letting you go Shivani

1082
02:39:24,000 --> 02:39:26,400
lf l'm going then your going

1083
02:39:28,000 --> 02:39:31,450
lt's not important for me to
live, l'd rather die

1084
02:39:31,000 --> 02:39:32,050
