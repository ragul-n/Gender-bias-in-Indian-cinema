1
00:02:49,235 --> 00:02:51,408
Before becoming a doctor
we've to take a pledge.

2
00:02:55,141 --> 00:02:56,779
It's called Hippocratic oath.

3
00:02:57,844 --> 00:03:00,688
Some oaths, like we'll always
take the side of truth"

4
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:04,552
...we'll respect every
life as precious.

5
00:03:05,084 --> 00:03:07,428
...we'll give more importance
to patients than ourselves.

6
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:12,665
It's easy to take pledge..

7
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,439
...but it's very difficult
to fulfill it.

8
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:20,004
And our story starts at
the same crossroad.

9
00:03:22,135 --> 00:03:26,311
Dr. Asthana was a famous general
surgeon of the country.

10
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:28,949
People call his God of surgery.

11
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:31,355
And I considered him my mentor.

12
00:03:34,147 --> 00:03:35,785
And to learn surgery from him..

13
00:03:36,816 --> 00:03:40,286
...I was doing internship in
Shekhavat General hospital.

14
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:57,745
Sir, who is this patient?

15
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:00,677
Entire media has ﬂocked to get
his news. - He's Mr. Laxman Gagal.

16
00:04:00,873 --> 00:04:04,047
Gagal?
One of the top business tycoon?

17
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:05,188
Yes.

18
00:04:08,047 --> 00:04:09,082
But what has happened?

19
00:04:09,315 --> 00:04:10,293
Accident.

20
00:04:13,686 --> 00:04:15,165
What the hell is happening here?

21
00:04:15,655 --> 00:04:16,998
This is not a goddamn circus.

22
00:04:18,224 --> 00:04:20,067
Get ward to patch up. Dr. Riya.

23
00:04:20,893 --> 00:04:21,871
Yes, sir.

24
00:04:22,895 --> 00:04:24,499
You'll be with the patient,
Dr. Romesh.

25
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,076
Sir.

26
00:04:32,071 --> 00:04:34,381
Hi, doctor. My name is Amit
Gagal. That's my father.

27
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:35,711
Amit Gagal. 3 things.

28
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:37,719
Keep your family away from me.

29
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:39,583
Don't ask about the patient's
condition again and again.

30
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:40,587
...I'll get irritated.

31
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:44,057
And finally, nobody besides
me can save your father.

32
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,593
Is that clear? Out.

33
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:00,410
Sir.

34
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:08,879
Sir, the heart rate is going
down. - Sir, it has dropped to 60.

35
00:05:09,108 --> 00:05:10,951
BP level?
- Sir, 90.. istolic.

36
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,423
Sister, get me dopamine drip..
Fast.

37
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:17,353
Doctor, he's sinking.

38
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,530
5 minutes. More. I'm almost done.

39
00:05:20,586 --> 00:05:22,088
Sir,
head beat has dropped to 40.

40
00:05:22,388 --> 00:05:24,265
Inter cardinal adrenaline.
Dr. Romesh.

41
00:05:24,724 --> 00:05:25,600
Yes, sir.

42
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:26,770
Nurse.. quickly.

43
00:05:27,894 --> 00:05:30,238
Sir. - Jab it between
third and fourth rib.

44
00:05:31,597 --> 00:05:32,871
Sir, directly on the heart?

45
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:34,739
Jab it now.
We're losing him. Come on.

46
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:43,781
What are you thinking?
Jab it now. Come on.

47
00:05:48,147 --> 00:05:51,026
Jab... Who let you in the
operation theater?

48
00:05:51,951 --> 00:05:53,225
Give it to me.
.. .Get out

49
00:06:03,463 --> 00:06:05,500
Ohh.. GOD <i>,</i> his BP has gone down to 55.

50
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:07,701
Atropine - 1 ampule.

51
00:06:07,934 --> 00:06:10,210
His BP is going down, doctor.

52
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:13,476
Atropine 1 ampule <i>,</i> nurse.
- Come on, quick sister.

53
00:06:17,276 --> 00:06:18,448
Heart rate is down to 20, sir.

54
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:22,919
Pulse is down.
Doctor.. Bradycardia

55
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:25,719
Nurse... defibrillator.

56
00:06:28,688 --> 00:06:29,666
Charge to 200.

57
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:31,868
Charged.

58
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:34,304
Clear.

59
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:40,439
Sir. Sir.

60
00:06:40,633 --> 00:06:41,634
Hold on.

61
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:47,478
Mr. Gagal had multiple rib
fractures and ruptured spleen.

62
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:51,347
Operation was successful.
He's in ICU right now..

63
00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:53,213
...under observation.

64
00:06:54,313 --> 00:06:55,656
He'll recover soon. Thank you.

65
00:06:55,848 --> 00:06:57,555
But when will he be able
to lead normal..

66
00:06:59,385 --> 00:07:01,695
Sir. I'm very sorry for whatever
happened today in OT.

67
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:03,265
Stay with Mr. Gagal in ICU.

68
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:06,233
If there is any emergency
press the code blue button.

69
00:07:07,026 --> 00:07:08,004
Yes, sir.

70
00:07:09,996 --> 00:07:11,339
You couldn't give an injection.

71
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:14,042
I hope you'll be able
to press the button.

72
00:07:15,735 --> 00:07:16,713
Sir, I'm..

73
00:07:54,106 --> 00:07:55,084
Hey, you..

74
00:07:57,376 --> 00:07:59,185
You didn't sleep yet?

75
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:01,118
It's 6.30 in the morning.

76
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:04,053
It's 11 in Sydney.
It's a live match.

77
00:08:04,717 --> 00:08:05,695
How can I sleep?

78
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:07,895
How did you get interested
in cricket suddenly?

79
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:10,127
Some cute new cricketer?

80
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:13,436
Just you .

81
00:08:27,106 --> 00:08:28,210
Ok... still now.

82
00:08:29,108 --> 00:08:30,883
I know you're upset that
I'm upset but..

83
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:34,789
But what Asthana said was true.

84
00:08:36,816 --> 00:08:37,794
I did freeze.

85
00:08:40,987 --> 00:08:42,330
What had happened to me?

86
00:08:42,755 --> 00:08:44,894
Sshh.. It's ok .. happens

87
00:08:46,826 --> 00:08:48,169
...this was your first surgery.

88
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:50,240
And..

89
00:08:51,764 --> 00:08:53,744
...In such a situation even
the best of best shiver.

90
00:08:54,133 --> 00:08:55,339
That's why we're interns..

91
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:58,539
...so that we can face
such a situation.

92
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:03,043
Anyway, it isn't easy to inject
in someone's lungs..

93
00:09:03,976 --> 00:09:05,649
...especially if he's such
a big celebrity.

94
00:09:06,979 --> 00:09:11,257
It means I'm a good person
and a bad doctor.

95
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,562
Only a good person can
become a good doctor.

96
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:20,598
By the way,
good person, good doctor..

97
00:09:21,527 --> 00:09:22,904
...become a good lover too.

98
00:09:52,658 --> 00:09:57,437
"Slowly and slowly.."

99
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:04,037
"..let this heart pine."

100
00:10:04,236 --> 00:10:09,743
"Slowly and slowly.."

101
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:16,223
"..let the aroma dwell
in the breath."

102
00:10:16,415 --> 00:10:22,388
"Express all the feelings
of heart today."

103
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:29,439
"Let our dreams ﬂy
with the breeze."

104
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:35,841
"Let's enjoy life a little."

105
00:10:36,068 --> 00:10:42,110
"Sacrifice this world for love."

106
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:47,815
"Relish this moment."

107
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:54,259
"Sacrifice this world for love."

108
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:57,468
Yes, I ate food. - How is study
going on? - That's fine too.

109
00:10:57,623 --> 00:10:59,569
Riya, where is my underwear?

110
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:01,397
Riya.. that. .
- Tell me.

111
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:03,938
Dad, I'll call you back.
I can't hear you.

112
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:07,440
What are you doing?
Dad was on the line.

113
00:11:08,267 --> 00:11:09,769
He doesn't know we stay together.

114
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:12,643
I'm from a small town,
not a foreigner.

115
00:11:12,972 --> 00:11:15,077
Fine, but where did you
hide my underwear.

116
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:17,784
It's here..

117
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:24,820
"When we're face to face..“

118
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:29,989
"..our eyes get locked."

119
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:37,539
"Just like me.."

120
00:11:37,763 --> 00:11:42,371
"..your eyes too look for me."

121
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:48,679
"I am restless because of you."

122
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:55,814
"Your prayers are for me."

123
00:11:56,015 --> 00:12:01,795
"Let's enjoy life a little."

124
00:12:01,987 --> 00:12:07,835
"Sacrifice this world for love."

125
00:12:08,027 --> 00:12:14,000
"Relish this moment."

126
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:20,707
"Sacrifice this world for love."

127
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:22,886
This man needs no introduction.

128
00:12:23,709 --> 00:12:27,486
He's an important for us as
Sachin is for Cricket.

129
00:12:29,648 --> 00:12:30,991
If not for Dr. Asthana..

130
00:12:31,183 --> 00:12:34,392
...we wouldn't have got funds
for our children's ward.

131
00:12:36,021 --> 00:12:38,558
Now I want Dr. Asthana
to say a few words.

132
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:41,628
What can I say?
He made me Tendulkar.

133
00:12:43,395 --> 00:12:45,602
He's also equally important
for our hospital.

134
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:50,141
"As much as BCCI for our
Indian cricket team.

135
00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:52,714
We can neither stay with them..

136
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:54,917
...nor without them.

137
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:01,524
Yes.

138
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:03,693
Hello.

139
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:06,919
Hi, doctor. ..Doctor this is my son - Ankur.

140
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:10,157
He is having terrible stomach-ache since last night.
Don't know, what's it?

141
00:13:14,026 --> 00:13:15,505
Come here, son. Come.

142
00:13:19,265 --> 00:13:20,243
Sit.

143
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:22,345
Did he vomit?

144
00:13:22,701 --> 00:13:25,307
No.
He said he feels like vomiting"

145
00:13:25,771 --> 00:13:26,749
"but he didn't.

146
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:29,843
I've given him a pain killer,
but it was of no use.

147
00:13:30,075 --> 00:13:31,019
Okay-

148
00:13:42,721 --> 00:13:45,224
Missus.. - Nandita. You
can call me Nandita.

149
00:13:45,424 --> 00:13:46,960
Nandita,
I can't be sure just now..

150
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:48,604
...but it could be appendicitis.

151
00:13:49,228 --> 00:13:50,673
I think it might be
better if you..

152
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,332
...let him stay here
for the night.

153
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:55,774
How can he get appendicitis
suddenly? I mean.. - No, no, no.

154
00:13:55,968 --> 00:13:58,949
It's not a serious situation.
It's a very common problem.

155
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:01,585
Actually appendix is such
a part of our body..

156
00:14:01,774 --> 00:14:03,754
...without which you can
easily function.

157
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:06,650
Just like tonsils.
We call them vestigial organs.

158
00:14:07,146 --> 00:14:08,124
Like a tail.

159
00:14:08,914 --> 00:14:09,949
Yeah, like a tail.

160
00:14:11,483 --> 00:14:13,588
The problem is that
for confirmation..

161
00:14:13,786 --> 00:14:15,288
...we need to do sonography..

162
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:18,525
...and it can be done only
tomorrow morning. - So I think..

163
00:14:18,757 --> 00:14:20,862
...It will be better if you keep
him here tonight because..

164
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:22,630
...If he gets pain in
the night at home..

165
00:14:22,828 --> 00:14:24,364
...It will just get difficult.
- Yeah.

166
00:14:25,798 --> 00:14:28,142
Fine. Then I'll get him admitted.

167
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,506
Okay, very good. Don't be scared.

168
00:14:34,173 --> 00:14:37,017
Excuse me. - Yes, sir. - In
which room is Ankur Arora ?

169
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:39,189
On the second ﬂoor.
Room number 201. - Thank you.

170
00:14:39,645 --> 00:14:40,623
Welcome.

171
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,038
What are you doing here?

172
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:00,835
The question is what
are you doing here?

173
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:02,977
What the hell is happening?

174
00:15:03,869 --> 00:15:05,405
And what happened to
Ankur suddenly?

175
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:07,846
Doctor thinks its appendicitis.

176
00:15:08,173 --> 00:15:09,846
He told me to get him
admitted so that..

177
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:11,544
...there won't be any
complication“.

178
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:12,916
...so I got him admitted.

179
00:15:14,213 --> 00:15:18,025
You did good.
But you should have phoned me.

180
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:19,758
I would have come with you.

181
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,125
It was already very late.

182
00:15:21,987 --> 00:15:23,523
I didn't want to bother you.

183
00:15:24,523 --> 00:15:26,002
Now you're being really formal.

184
00:15:30,996 --> 00:15:33,476
You're not just my employee,
but my friend too.

185
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,047
You should have phoned me. You
know I'm always there for you.

186
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:44,921
Sit.

187
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:48,925
Sandwich.

188
00:15:49,548 --> 00:15:50,925
I don't feel like eating.

189
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:54,057
Look, eat it.

190
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:56,496
Or else you'll get acidity
and all that nonsense.

191
00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:58,828
Even the mother will have to
be admitted with the son.

192
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:16,147
He was telling me since morning
that he has stomach-ache.

193
00:16:18,877 --> 00:16:21,050
I thought he was making an excuse
to avoid going to school.

194
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:31,732
I was so stupid.

195
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:45,748
Ankur.

196
00:16:47,806 --> 00:16:49,285
I thought you were lying.

197
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:51,844
I'm so sorry.

198
00:16:52,811 --> 00:16:55,519
You kept telling me the whole
day but I didn't understand.

199
00:16:57,649 --> 00:16:59,151
It must've hurt a lot.

200
00:17:00,819 --> 00:17:03,857
Didn't it? Momma is so stupid.

201
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:07,496
Mom, don't worry. I'm okay.

202
00:17:08,794 --> 00:17:12,105
It doesn't pain now.
I'm fine, mom.

203
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:17,146
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

204
00:17:22,307 --> 00:17:23,308
So sorry.

205
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:30,122
Who is the next patient?
- Ankur Arora.

206
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:35,724
Good morning, doctor.

207
00:17:35,988 --> 00:17:37,331
My name is Nandita Arora and..

208
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:39,059
Who admitted him?
- I did, sir.

209
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:41,903
Patient was in pain and
complaining of nausea.

210
00:17:42,194 --> 00:17:44,299
I had doubt that it must
be appendicitis so..

211
00:17:44,496 --> 00:17:46,203
...I thought it better to admit.
- Was sonography performed?

212
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:47,206
No, sir.

213
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:50,437
How do you know it's appendicitis?
It could be uretic stones?

214
00:17:50,803 --> 00:17:54,307
Sir, complain was of stomach-ache.
- It could be lntussusception.

215
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,683
Sir, there was no complain
of blood in..

216
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:58,821
...the stool and the pain
wasn't so much.

217
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:00,883
Viral gastroenteritis.

218
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,960
Sir, there was neither
fever nor diarrhea.

219
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:09,958
Diagnose is right.

220
00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:12,260
The decision to admit
is right too.

221
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:15,397
Get a CT scan. You'll know
how much the infection is.

222
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:16,971
Yes, sir.
- Are you his mother?

223
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:20,436
This appendicitis shouldn't be
ignored for long. It's not good.

224
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,977
We may have to perform operation
on getting the scan report.

225
00:18:23,836 --> 00:18:26,942
Today OT is not vacant, so we'll
perform operation tomorrow.

226
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:29,279
As the pain is less,
there is no problem.

227
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:30,484
As you say.

228
00:18:30,709 --> 00:18:33,383
Sir, actually OT is available
today. - Today OT isn't available.

229
00:18:33,579 --> 00:18:35,752
No, sir. The gall bladder
surgery was canceled.

230
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:38,656
Today OT isn't available. Operation
will be performed tomorrow.

231
00:18:53,098 --> 00:18:54,577
Don't you do that to me ever again.

232
00:18:56,068 --> 00:18:58,947
Don't interrupt me again
in front of my patient.

233
00:18:59,204 --> 00:19:00,080
Sir, it was just..

234
00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:03,253
When I say OT isn't available,
then OT isn't available.

235
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:05,250
Sir, I was told that surgery
is canceled..

236
00:19:05,444 --> 00:19:06,787
...so I thought of informing you.

237
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,083
Doctor. Romesh.

238
00:19:09,781 --> 00:19:11,260
I know the surgery was canceled.

239
00:19:12,584 --> 00:19:13,756
I know OT is available.

240
00:19:14,086 --> 00:19:16,123
But the child will stay here
tonight. Do you know why?

241
00:19:17,256 --> 00:19:18,257
Because I say so.

242
00:19:19,258 --> 00:19:23,400
If you want to become a
successful doctor, remember..

243
00:19:23,929 --> 00:19:25,738
...this is a profession
<i>as</i> well <i>as</i> business.

244
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:27,670
Treatment takes medicine.

245
00:19:27,966 --> 00:19:31,072
Modern machines, medicines and
staff are not for free.

246
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:32,305
One has to pay money for them.

247
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:34,848
Hospital runs on money,
not just on virtues.

248
00:19:37,943 --> 00:19:40,981
No money, no hospital.
And no hospital, no treatment.

249
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:44,594
If you sympathize so much
with her, tell her..

250
00:19:44,783 --> 00:19:46,490
...not to go to expensive beauty
parlor for a month.

251
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:47,959
She'll save the money.

252
00:19:49,488 --> 00:19:52,469
If she can't do this much for
her son, why should we?

253
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:56,832
Money from one patient will
be used for other.

254
00:19:57,095 --> 00:19:59,473
They very well pay for each
other. Do you understand?

255
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:00,540
Yes, sir.

256
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:02,302
Do you understand, doctor" Romesh?

257
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:06,311
I'm asking you, Dr. Romesh.
Do you understand?

258
00:20:06,505 --> 00:20:07,848
Sir, we understand.

259
00:20:08,974 --> 00:20:12,581
We all understand.
We understand what you're saying.

260
00:20:16,848 --> 00:20:20,227
Try to understand.
Learn from her.

261
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:30,873
Take it easy.

262
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:40,678
Hey, champ. You okay in there?

263
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:44,646
Yeah. Okay. I'm not scared.

264
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:48,018
Good.
- Can I ask a question?

265
00:20:49,214 --> 00:20:50,158
Sure.

266
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:53,489
Do people die during operation
of Assendipitis?

267
00:20:54,653 --> 00:20:56,428
It's Appendicitis,
not Assendipitis.

268
00:20:57,356 --> 00:21:00,462
Nobody dies in this operation,
only lives are saved.

269
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,267
And we won't let you die.

270
00:21:03,495 --> 00:21:04,473
Are you sure?

271
00:21:05,497 --> 00:21:06,297
Very sure.

272
00:21:06,298 --> 00:21:06,435
Very sure.

273
00:21:14,673 --> 00:21:18,644
Is it only appendicitis or
some other complication?

274
00:21:19,911 --> 00:21:20,912
Only appendicitis.

275
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:24,825
But if you and Dr. Asthana want..

276
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:26,688
...we can perform a
dozen more tests.

277
00:21:27,853 --> 00:21:29,526
You've to run this hospital's
business.

278
00:21:30,856 --> 00:21:32,563
Romesh, I was just.

279
00:21:32,758 --> 00:21:33,964
You understand everything.

280
00:21:37,562 --> 00:21:38,870
I'm getting bored.

281
00:21:40,198 --> 00:21:41,905
For how long should I keep lying?

282
00:21:42,234 --> 00:21:43,406
10 more minutes, champ.

283
00:21:48,907 --> 00:21:50,250
Can I tell you something?

284
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:53,247
But please don't tell mom.

285
00:21:54,746 --> 00:21:58,023
Sure.
I'm expert in keeping secrets.

286
00:21:58,617 --> 00:22:02,997
Actually,
I don't feel good as I'm sick.

287
00:22:04,756 --> 00:22:06,793
Because mom is sad because of me.

288
00:22:07,726 --> 00:22:09,069
She was already sad.

289
00:22:10,228 --> 00:22:13,072
And she got sadder.

290
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:15,607
Don't worry. It will be fine.

291
00:22:16,234 --> 00:22:18,111
She thinks I don't
know anything"

292
00:22:19,638 --> 00:22:20,616
...I'm a kid.

293
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:23,016
But I'm not a kid.

294
00:22:23,575 --> 00:22:26,579
I know dad has left us for ever.

295
00:22:29,981 --> 00:22:31,016
I also know..

296
00:22:32,084 --> 00:22:33,961
"That mom doesn't cry
in front of me.

297
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,157
She cries alone in her bedroom.

298
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:43,503
Please cure me. I'll grow up
and earn lots of money..

299
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:46,502
...only for mom.

300
00:22:47,265 --> 00:22:49,245
I'll buy lots of presents
for her.

301
00:22:50,335 --> 00:22:51,837
I'll always keep her happy.

302
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:56,178
I promise not to leave her alone.

303
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:14,863
Romesh, it's not fair.

304
00:23:15,627 --> 00:23:17,265
You're venting out Asthana's
anger on me.

305
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:19,701
I was just trying to
ease the tension.

306
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:22,003
...between you and Dr. Asthana
that's all.

307
00:23:22,801 --> 00:23:24,337
It was really getting
out of control.

308
00:23:25,971 --> 00:23:29,009
Riya,
you know, when I was small..

309
00:23:30,842 --> 00:23:32,549
...my mother used to tell me..

310
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:35,919
...when a person loses courage..

311
00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:38,721
...his wisdom increases.

312
00:23:40,852 --> 00:23:42,832
And when I was small
my mother too said..

313
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:45,590
...It's better to be quiet
then fight for no reason.

314
00:23:46,491 --> 00:23:49,199
Fight only when you can.
Not when you're powerless.

315
00:23:55,534 --> 00:23:57,377
Your Dr. Asthana won't
let me in OT..

316
00:23:57,569 --> 00:23:59,378
...tomorrow for Ankur's operation.

317
00:24:03,575 --> 00:24:04,781
Take care of the kid.

318
00:24:12,684 --> 00:24:15,528
And now will you end
your vow of silence.

319
00:24:26,865 --> 00:24:27,843
I love you.

320
00:24:28,934 --> 00:24:29,935
That's the problem.

321
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:32,114
I love you too.

322
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:54,600
Mom. I'm hungry.

323
00:24:56,094 --> 00:24:57,539
You can't eat now, Ankur.

324
00:24:58,396 --> 00:24:59,898
Your operation is in an hour,
son.

325
00:25:00,398 --> 00:25:03,743
Come on. Be a brave boy.
You can eat later.

326
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:08,216
You are mamma's brave boy. Okay.

327
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,818
Good morning, Ankur.
Yoo..

328
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:19,996
Good morning, ma'am.
- Good morning.

329
00:25:20,485 --> 00:25:22,260
Ma'am, this is the list
of surgical kit which..

330
00:25:22,454 --> 00:25:23,990
...you've to buy from
the surgical shop.

331
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:26,726
We'll return whatever
we don't use.

332
00:25:28,593 --> 00:25:30,300
If I give you the money,
will you bring it?

333
00:25:30,495 --> 00:25:32,168
Nobody is here with us.

334
00:25:33,798 --> 00:25:34,776
I'm sorry, ma'am.

335
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,908
Actually hospital staff isn't
allowed to take money like this.

336
00:25:38,637 --> 00:25:40,617
And I think,
it won't take too long.

337
00:25:40,805 --> 00:25:43,115
Because there isn't much crowd
in the shop in the morning.

338
00:25:45,343 --> 00:25:46,981
Bye, Ankur. Thank you, ma'am.
- Bye.

339
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:53,495
You'll be okay.
I'll bring it within 5 minutes.

340
00:25:54,653 --> 00:25:57,930
By the time send to your Gina,
Yap-yap. Hot Snap.

341
00:25:58,657 --> 00:25:59,863
WhatsApp, mom!

342
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:03,396
WhatsApp!
- Okay, I got it.

343
00:26:04,796 --> 00:26:07,936
WhatsApp! Whaats. .App!

344
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:14,505
Be careful. Careful.

345
00:26:14,506 --> 00:26:14,711
Be careful. Careful.

346
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:17,019
Are you scared?

347
00:26:17,676 --> 00:26:18,654
No, mom.

348
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:20,746
Doctor will take care of you.

349
00:26:21,479 --> 00:26:23,857
And Ajay uncle will
take care of you.

350
00:26:24,482 --> 00:26:27,326
Naughty. - Of course I'll.
And that's a promise.

351
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:32,098
Bye, mom.

352
00:26:32,324 --> 00:26:34,133
Bye, son.
- See you, Champ.

353
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:46,480
Good morning, Ankur.
I hope your stomach is empty.

354
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:48,910
Did you eat anything
in the morning?

355
00:26:49,341 --> 00:26:50,217
No.

356
00:26:50,408 --> 00:26:52,547
Very good. Sister" take it.

357
00:26:54,379 --> 00:26:55,357
Sister.

358
00:26:57,449 --> 00:27:03,263
Actually when mom went
downstairs, I was very hungry.

359
00:27:04,422 --> 00:27:06,868
So I ate some biscuits.

360
00:27:08,259 --> 00:27:09,897
Don't tell mom.

361
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:12,169
Or else she'll be very angry.

362
00:27:14,532 --> 00:27:18,480
Excuse me, sir.
The patient of appendicitis..

363
00:27:18,603 --> 00:27:20,810
Sir. He's not NBM, sir.
- what"?

364
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:26,181
Sir, the patient Ankur Arora
ate some biscuits.

365
00:27:26,378 --> 00:27:28,881
So for some biscuits I can't
postpone the operation.

366
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,753
There is a queue for operation.

367
00:27:31,116 --> 00:27:32,891
But sir,
operation is within an hour.

368
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:35,894
I'll use Ryles tube.
What's that for?

369
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:39,325
Sir, to clear the patient's
stomach before the operation.

370
00:27:39,591 --> 00:27:41,195
Exactly. It will be done. Go now.

371
00:27:42,761 --> 00:27:43,762
No, wife isn't coming.

372
00:27:43,962 --> 00:27:46,670
You can introduce me to anybody.
Ofcourse I'm joking.

373
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:49,645
Okay-

374
00:27:51,403 --> 00:27:52,507
Excuse me, ma'am.

375
00:27:52,937 --> 00:27:55,713
Yes. - Sir,
this is standard disclaimer form.

376
00:27:56,074 --> 00:27:58,953
A routine operation formality.
So ma'am has to sign here.

377
00:27:59,144 --> 00:28:00,122
Just sign here.

378
00:28:06,284 --> 00:28:07,262
We're ready, sir.

379
00:28:07,452 --> 00:28:08,430
Good.

380
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:13,563
Is everything okay, sir?

381
00:28:20,331 --> 00:28:21,833
I had to do something.
What was it?

382
00:28:24,602 --> 00:28:25,603
Damn my phone.

383
00:28:30,642 --> 00:28:32,315
Turn if off and keep it there.
- Sir.

384
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:34,546
Scalpel please.

385
00:28:34,813 --> 00:28:35,951
Dr. Romesh..

386
00:28:37,315 --> 00:28:38,453
...what are you doing here?

387
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:40,323
I thought you would
be in the surgery.

388
00:28:40,518 --> 00:28:42,657
No,
actually I'm only an intern here.

389
00:28:43,154 --> 00:28:44,963
Dr. Asthana is performing
the operation.

390
00:28:45,657 --> 00:28:47,500
So nothing to worry about.
He's the best.

391
00:29:33,671 --> 00:29:36,174
Thank you very much, everybody.
Keep me posted. - Yeah.

392
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:46,728
Doctor.
- Hello.

393
00:29:47,252 --> 00:29:48,697
Ah.. Ankur..

394
00:29:49,554 --> 00:29:51,500
He's all right.
He'll wake up in sometime.

395
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:54,437
Thank you. - I got email
for Geneva convention.

396
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:56,336
I'll reply within 2 days.

397
00:30:06,704 --> 00:30:10,311
Son Ankur, show me your tongue.

398
00:30:12,043 --> 00:30:13,021
Good.

399
00:30:13,912 --> 00:30:16,916
Open your eyes.
Open your eyes. This too..

400
00:30:17,715 --> 00:30:18,693
Good boy.

401
00:30:25,723 --> 00:30:26,701
Oh my God.

402
00:30:28,459 --> 00:30:29,995
He's vomiting. He's asphyxiating.

403
00:30:30,228 --> 00:30:32,834
Oh God.
Nurse suction machine. Quick.

404
00:30:38,403 --> 00:30:40,110
Sir, his oxygen saturation
is dropping.

405
00:30:41,973 --> 00:30:42,951
Quickly... Sister.

406
00:30:47,745 --> 00:30:49,281
Call Dr. Asthana quickly.
- Yes, doctor.

407
00:30:51,249 --> 00:30:52,853
Doctor... Doctor Asthana.

408
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:53,995
Just a minute.

409
00:30:54,586 --> 00:30:57,089
Doctor,
the patient of appendectomy.

410
00:30:57,322 --> 00:30:58,858
He's asphyxiating in the OT.

411
00:31:00,458 --> 00:31:02,802
Ryles tube! Shit...

412
00:31:03,127 --> 00:31:05,505
I can't see anything. Let him just go.

413
00:31:08,967 --> 00:31:09,945
Hold it.

414
00:31:12,604 --> 00:31:15,210
What is happening?
- He asphyxiated, doctor.

415
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:17,853
Why didn't anyone tell me
he ate before operation?

416
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:20,587
Intubate him.

417
00:31:20,812 --> 00:31:22,519
There is lot of vomit.
Let me clean this first.

418
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:24,250
Sir,
oxygen saturation is down to 60.

419
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:29,220
Just intubate him. - Oxygen isn't
reaching his brain.

420
00:31:29,454 --> 00:31:30,660
Nurse, quick. Get the tube.

421
00:31:31,289 --> 00:31:33,496
Sir, oxygen saturation is down to 50.

422
00:31:34,525 --> 00:31:36,334
I can't see anything.
There is food all over.

423
00:31:36,527 --> 00:31:38,131
You're not doing this
for the first time.

424
00:31:38,329 --> 00:31:40,536
You've done this thousand time. -
Now don't disappoint me, please.

425
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:42,234
I can not see any damn thing.

426
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:46,548
Ventilator.

427
00:31:47,005 --> 00:31:48,211
Saturation 45, sir.

428
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:49,718
Listen.

429
00:31:50,508 --> 00:31:52,010
Tube is in esophagus, not
in the trachea.

430
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:53,848
There's no vapors, doctor.
Come on. Take it out.

431
00:31:55,546 --> 00:31:56,718
Circulation down to 35, sir.

432
00:31:57,382 --> 00:31:58,360
It's into trachea now.

433
00:31:59,484 --> 00:32:00,462
Are you sure.
Yes Sir.

434
00:32:08,393 --> 00:32:09,371
Reading, Dr Riya.

435
00:32:09,994 --> 00:32:11,803
Saturation is 45, Sir. Improving.

436
00:32:14,732 --> 00:32:15,836
It's going up, sir.

437
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:26,380
Just check him please.

438
00:32:27,578 --> 00:32:28,921
What?
- Just check the boy.

439
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:36,061
Ankur.
Ankur, open your eyes, Ankur.

440
00:32:36,921 --> 00:32:39,458
Ankur. Ankur, can you hear me?

441
00:32:39,857 --> 00:32:41,029
Open your eyes, Ankur.

442
00:32:41,259 --> 00:32:43,068
Ankur, open your eyes.

443
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:45,904
Ankur. Can you hear me?
Ankur, open your eyes.

444
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:48,335
Ankur, open your eyes.
Ankur. Ankur.

445
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:50,905
He's not responding.

446
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:54,081
We've lost him.

447
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:55,945
What? He is in Hypoxia.

448
00:32:58,609 --> 00:32:59,587
He's in coma.

449
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:11,466
I messed up.

450
00:33:14,058 --> 00:33:15,401
For the first time in life..

451
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:21,272
What happened, doctor?

452
00:33:25,603 --> 00:33:27,310
Roseena told me that
this patient.

453
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,313
...ate some biscuits before
the operation.

454
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:33,588
What?

455
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:36,689
I had to use Ryles Tube...

456
00:33:40,818 --> 00:33:41,796
...I forgot.

457
00:33:45,757 --> 00:33:46,735
Damn..

458
00:33:56,834 --> 00:33:57,812
Listen..

459
00:33:59,837 --> 00:34:01,680
We all are doctors so..

460
00:34:03,474 --> 00:34:05,078
...doctors help each other.

461
00:34:09,614 --> 00:34:11,491
Whatever happened in
this operation theatre.

462
00:34:12,817 --> 00:34:14,421
...will stay here.
- But doctor"

463
00:34:14,619 --> 00:34:17,498
Mistake..
It's not just my mistake.

464
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:19,768
Dr. Shrestha.

465
00:34:20,992 --> 00:34:22,801
...you too should have checked.
- But..

466
00:34:23,361 --> 00:34:25,898
Okay, okay.
Whatever has happened..

467
00:34:28,332 --> 00:34:31,006
...won't be disclosed outside.
Is that clear?

468
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:34,843
No, Dr. Asthana.
If someone asks us..

469
00:34:35,173 --> 00:34:36,777
...how did the child go in coma..

470
00:34:36,974 --> 00:34:39,318
...why is he on ventilator,
what will we say?

471
00:34:39,677 --> 00:34:40,655
Yes..

472
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:44,656
...we'll say he got Post
operative Atelectasis

473
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:48,022
His lungs collapsed.

474
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,424
During operation.

475
00:34:51,055 --> 00:34:52,898
...he couldn't breathe.
His lungs collapsed so..

476
00:34:55,693 --> 00:34:57,036
...we kept him on ventilator..

477
00:34:58,663 --> 00:35:00,336
...still he went in coma.

478
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:02,942
We can say. We're doctors.

479
00:35:05,403 --> 00:35:06,381
But..

480
00:35:07,905 --> 00:35:09,248
Now you've to decide..

481
00:35:11,576 --> 00:35:12,714
...are you with me or..

482
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:20,262
"Because if you're not with me,
you're against me.

483
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:24,933
After that..

484
00:35:25,223 --> 00:35:26,930
...your degrees,
experience, influence..

485
00:35:29,694 --> 00:35:31,002
...won't be of any use.

486
00:35:33,731 --> 00:35:36,712
You know that very well.. Doctor.

487
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,813
...At least, it won't be of
use in this country.

488
00:35:42,907 --> 00:35:44,011
Nobody can touch me.

489
00:35:47,078 --> 00:35:49,854
Don't look at me as if I am a criminal.

490
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:02,297
Okay.. So it's clear.
Okay, done.

491
00:36:02,727 --> 00:36:04,035
You can go. Please.

492
00:36:09,133 --> 00:36:10,578
Riya, wait.
- No, you may go.

493
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:19,378
You've to inform his family.

494
00:36:26,584 --> 00:36:27,562
Do as I say.

495
00:36:29,153 --> 00:36:30,131
Is that clear?

496
00:36:31,589 --> 00:36:32,567
Hmm..

497
00:36:43,601 --> 00:36:45,376
Let him first come out
of the hospital.

498
00:36:47,104 --> 00:36:48,139
I've no idea.

499
00:36:50,308 --> 00:36:52,310
We'll surely go.

500
00:36:55,146 --> 00:36:57,285
I'm not sure. May be about a week.

501
00:36:59,984 --> 00:37:00,962
Fine.

502
00:37:03,454 --> 00:37:04,728
I know you love that.

503
00:37:07,625 --> 00:37:08,603
Yes, doctor?

504
00:37:09,794 --> 00:37:11,296
A complication has arised.

505
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:13,707
Complication?
- That..

506
00:37:14,999 --> 00:37:17,343
After the operation your son..

507
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:19,006
His lungs collapsed.

508
00:37:19,203 --> 00:37:20,079
What?

509
00:37:20,304 --> 00:37:23,285
It doesn't happen,
but this is a rare case.

510
00:37:24,308 --> 00:37:25,309
After the operation..

511
00:37:25,509 --> 00:37:28,388
...oxygen didn't reach his
brains and he went into coma.

512
00:37:28,846 --> 00:37:30,826
We've kept him on
the ventilator.

513
00:37:31,215 --> 00:37:34,389
We're giving antibiotics.
We'll shift him in ICU quickly.

514
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:37,623
In such cases,
within a couple of days..

515
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:41,699
...the patient comes out of coma.
Don't worry.

516
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:46,135
Ankur is now the
responsibility of this hospital

517
00:37:52,737 --> 00:37:56,082
Hey. What is it?
You forgot the bag in car.

518
00:38:17,762 --> 00:38:18,740
How was it?

519
00:38:36,414 --> 00:38:37,392
Coffee?

520
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:40,895
Here.
Thanks.

521
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:00,442
What happened, Riya?

522
00:39:04,909 --> 00:39:06,513
What happened?
ls something wrong?

523
00:39:10,915 --> 00:39:12,053
Riya, what's happened?

524
00:39:17,154 --> 00:39:18,030
What?

525
00:39:18,255 --> 00:39:19,427
I'm not feeling so good..

526
00:39:21,425 --> 00:39:22,403
Riya, but..

527
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:15,916
He's in coma because
of lung collapsed.

528
00:40:18,149 --> 00:40:19,127
Doctors say so.

529
00:40:20,651 --> 00:40:22,597
They say they'll give antibiotics
and keep in ICU.

530
00:40:24,688 --> 00:40:25,666
How did it happen?

531
00:40:26,357 --> 00:40:27,665
Such a small child in coma.

532
00:40:29,326 --> 00:40:31,932
Doctor, how serious is this?

533
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:35,042
It's serious.

534
00:40:37,835 --> 00:40:39,371
Ajay.
- Yeah.

535
00:40:43,073 --> 00:40:45,713
Ajay, I've read this contract
Smith and Morrison.

536
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:49,448
You talk. I think it's fine.
You read it once and and then talk.

537
00:40:59,423 --> 00:41:01,460
Hey!
Talk to them. What are you doing?

538
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:04,762
You've not slept since 24 hours.

539
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:07,636
Please go home and rest.

540
00:41:08,933 --> 00:41:11,379
I'm here with Ankur.
I'll take care of him.

541
00:41:11,602 --> 00:41:14,776
How will you?
How can you take care?

542
00:41:15,072 --> 00:41:16,415
He doesn't need anything.

543
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:19,243
He can neither talks,
nor eats nor drinks.

544
00:41:20,778 --> 00:41:22,883
He doesn't need anything.

545
00:41:23,747 --> 00:41:25,090
Neither friends nor mother.

546
00:41:27,918 --> 00:41:29,022
Nandita, come on.

547
00:41:29,253 --> 00:41:31,631
What are you doing?
There's so much office work to do.

548
00:41:32,656 --> 00:41:34,966
What can we do if
someone is sick?

549
00:41:35,426 --> 00:41:37,633
Life doesn't stop. It goes on.

550
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:40,775
Wonk goes on. It doesn't matter
if anyone is sick or..

551
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,477
You call and talk to them.

552
00:41:45,569 --> 00:41:47,242
Finalise time of contract.

553
00:42:32,816 --> 00:42:33,692
Yes, sir.

554
00:42:33,884 --> 00:42:35,158
Nurse, send Roseena.

555
00:42:44,161 --> 00:42:46,266
Why do you need to show
efficiency at the wrong place?

556
00:42:47,965 --> 00:42:49,273
Why did you write"

557
00:42:49,466 --> 00:42:51,844
...Ankur ate something, an
hour before the surgery?

558
00:42:52,036 --> 00:42:53,310
But sir, I had informed you..

559
00:42:53,504 --> 00:42:55,040
I know.
That's why I'm telling you.

560
00:43:00,477 --> 00:43:01,956
Now I've to change the time span.

561
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:05,353
But why, sir? What has happened?

562
00:43:13,223 --> 00:43:14,566
I forgot to use Ryles Tube.

563
00:43:15,025 --> 00:43:16,163
Oh my God, sir.

564
00:43:18,362 --> 00:43:20,364
Sir, that child Ankur..
- He's in coma.

565
00:43:22,533 --> 00:43:25,514
And.. the hospital rules..

566
00:43:25,703 --> 00:43:27,740
To hell with the hospital rules.

567
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:32,447
Whose hospital is this?

568
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:35,082
Mr. Shekhawat.

569
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:37,281
...and yours, sir.

570
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:42,252
And whose work is
it to maintain"

571
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:45,331
...this hospital's reputation?

572
00:43:46,757 --> 00:43:48,634
Your, Sir.. I'm doing that only.

573
00:43:55,766 --> 00:43:56,744
Take this money.

574
00:43:57,401 --> 00:43:59,779
And return to the city or village
from where you have came.

575
00:44:00,604 --> 00:44:01,981
I'll handle any inquiry here.

576
00:44:02,206 --> 00:44:03,708
Does this "9" look fine?

577
00:44:04,742 --> 00:44:05,720
Natural?

578
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:10,758
Yes, sir.

579
00:44:10,948 --> 00:44:14,760
Sure. Okay... Okay.

580
00:45:27,825 --> 00:45:30,533
Nurse, patient number 23..

581
00:45:30,694 --> 00:45:32,537
...Ankur Arora. Room number 104.

582
00:45:32,696 --> 00:45:33,902
Who was the nurse on duty?

583
00:45:34,131 --> 00:45:36,236
Wait a minute, sir. I'll just check.
- Please.

584
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:42,049
Hurry up. Please.

585
00:45:45,309 --> 00:45:49,314
Yes, I've it sir. Nurse Roseena.
- Okay. Where can I find her now?

586
00:45:49,513 --> 00:45:50,685
I don't know, sir.

587
00:45:51,315 --> 00:45:53,488
If she's off duty,
she'll be home.

588
00:45:53,684 --> 00:45:54,662
Off duty?

589
00:45:55,152 --> 00:45:57,098
But her duty is till 9 pm.
How can she just.

590
00:45:57,254 --> 00:45:59,860
I've no idea, sir.
But she has left for the day.

591
00:46:26,183 --> 00:46:27,526
Hey.. Where can I find Roseena?

592
00:46:27,718 --> 00:46:29,720
She's on the first ﬂoor, Room No. 28.

593
00:46:47,738 --> 00:46:48,716
Riya.

594
00:46:51,775 --> 00:46:53,220
What had happened in OT today?

595
00:46:55,779 --> 00:46:57,816
Riya. What happened to Ankur?

596
00:46:58,715 --> 00:47:01,195
Didn't I tell you, his
lungs had collapsed?

597
00:47:01,885 --> 00:47:04,229
I'm not asking about what you
all are lying to the world..

598
00:47:04,721 --> 00:47:06,394
...I'm asking what actually
happened there.

599
00:47:07,424 --> 00:47:09,461
Answer will not change
on asking again and again.

600
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:11,205
Lungs had collapsed.
- Really?

601
00:47:12,062 --> 00:47:14,508
If his lungs had collapsed,
why wasn't bronchoscopy advised.

602
00:47:15,098 --> 00:47:16,702
Why was he kept directly on antibiotics?

603
00:47:17,401 --> 00:47:18,778
Neither chest x-ray
nor ABG analysis.

604
00:47:19,002 --> 00:47:20,640
Directly Magnamycin.- Please,
Romesh.

605
00:47:20,804 --> 00:47:23,250
Not me but Dr. Asthana decide
the line of treatment.

606
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:25,453
You're treating aspiration
pneumonia.

607
00:47:25,642 --> 00:47:27,747
Because he had vomited after
the operation. Right?

608
00:47:28,245 --> 00:47:29,451
No, it was a lung collapse.

609
00:47:29,646 --> 00:47:31,592
Riya, look into my eyes.

610
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:34,162
And tell me the truth.
Just tell me what happened.

611
00:47:34,618 --> 00:47:36,495
Romesh, please.
This isn't your problem.

612
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:39,167
This is my problem.
This is my problem.

613
00:47:39,489 --> 00:47:41,628
I promised that boy nothing
will happen to him.

614
00:47:41,959 --> 00:47:43,768
He's in coma in the
hospital right now.

615
00:47:43,961 --> 00:47:45,440
And you say it's not my problem.

616
00:47:45,662 --> 00:47:47,335
Romesh, please stop.
Riya, just tell me.

617
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:49,970
Did he vomit in the OT
after the operation?

618
00:47:50,167 --> 00:47:52,306
Romesh, stop it.
I've told you what had happened.

619
00:47:52,502 --> 00:47:54,948
No, Riya. You're lying.
Who you're trying to save?

620
00:47:55,772 --> 00:47:58,082
I'm not lying.
I'm not saving anyone.

621
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:04,685
Riya, we became doctors to
save people's lives..

622
00:48:04,848 --> 00:48:06,452
...not to run hospital business.

623
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:08,927
Our work is to alleviate
people's pain..

624
00:48:09,152 --> 00:48:10,654
...not to become cause
of their pain.

625
00:48:10,854 --> 00:48:13,994
A mother is questioning God today,
why he's doing this to her.

626
00:48:14,992 --> 00:48:17,302
She doesn't know that it's
not God's fault..

627
00:48:17,494 --> 00:48:20,134
...It's those fault who
are trying to be God.

628
00:48:22,799 --> 00:48:23,641
Riya, please.

629
00:48:23,834 --> 00:48:27,179
For God's sake open the door
and tell me the truth.

630
00:48:27,671 --> 00:48:28,877
Please, I beg you.

631
00:48:36,513 --> 00:48:42,191
"Why are you not like
your reﬂection?"

632
00:48:42,986 --> 00:48:49,631
"Why isn't your nature
like your face?"

633
00:48:55,766 --> 00:49:01,717
"Why are you not like
your reﬂection?"

634
00:49:02,105 --> 00:49:08,317
"Why isn't your nature
like your face?"

635
00:49:08,912 --> 00:49:15,193
"Why does it keep changing form?"

636
00:49:15,385 --> 00:49:21,597
"O life,
why do you envy my dreams?"

637
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:27,902
"What is this pinning
in the heart?"

638
00:49:28,231 --> 00:49:34,011
"It makes the tears roll down."

639
00:49:34,204 --> 00:49:40,155
"Why are you not like
your reﬂection?"

640
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:46,758
"Why isn't your nature
like your face?"

641
00:49:55,258 --> 00:49:56,362
You're not ready yet?

642
00:49:57,394 --> 00:49:58,372
Let's go home.

643
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:01,775
No, I'll stay here.
I've some work.

644
00:50:13,176 --> 00:50:14,154
Sir.

645
00:50:18,915 --> 00:50:25,059
"What complain you've
against me?"

646
00:50:25,322 --> 00:50:31,102
"Life seems to be lost
in the struggle."

647
00:50:31,762 --> 00:50:37,940
"The heart is pierced
little by little."

648
00:50:38,135 --> 00:50:44,279
"O life,
why do you've so many complains?"

649
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:50,989
"The world seemed to have
turned against me."

650
00:50:51,214 --> 00:50:57,495
"Now there is nothing
left without you."

651
00:50:57,721 --> 00:51:03,899
"Why does it keep changing form?"

652
00:51:04,127 --> 00:51:07,631
"O life,
why do you envy my dreams?"

653
00:51:07,831 --> 00:51:09,708
Come on. You've to eat.

654
00:51:10,333 --> 00:51:16,011
"Why are you not like
your reﬂection?"

655
00:51:16,473 --> 00:51:24,153
"Why isn't your nature
like your face?"

656
00:51:51,608 --> 00:51:52,382
Ready?

657
00:51:53,009 --> 00:51:53,885
Give injection.

658
00:51:54,077 --> 00:51:56,216
Doctor, what is happening?
- Get her out.

659
00:51:56,413 --> 00:51:57,858
Ma'am.
- Please go out.

660
00:51:58,048 --> 00:52:00,050
Is he okay?
- Nandita, come out.

661
00:52:00,250 --> 00:52:02,059
Doctor.
- Please come out.

662

Efcorlin 2 ampoules.. fast.

Sodium meta..

665
00:52:15,198 --> 00:52:16,176
What?

666
00:52:26,476 --> 00:52:27,853

667
00:52:32,315 --> 00:52:33,521
Lignocaine 50mg.

Come on, boy.

676
00:54:07,811 --> 00:54:08,949
Is my son, dead?

677
00:54:11,514 --> 00:54:12,492
Doctor.

678
00:54:19,422 --> 00:54:20,400
Is my son, dead?

679
00:54:55,425 --> 00:55:01,569
"Everything seems to have
come to a standstill."

680
00:55:01,798 --> 00:55:07,612
'Time froze with you."

681
00:55:08,238 --> 00:55:14,416
"You are so lost in yourself.."

682
00:55:14,611 --> 00:55:20,653
"..that now you don't
even think of me."

683
00:55:21,217 --> 00:55:27,532
"0 life, please change a little."

684
00:55:27,724 --> 00:55:33,936
"Have mercy on me.
Don't be stubborn."

685
00:55:34,130 --> 00:55:40,274
"Why doesn't it walk with us?"

686
00:55:40,470 --> 00:55:46,512
"O life,
why do you envy my dreams?"

687
00:55:46,743 --> 00:55:52,591
"Why are you not like
your reﬂection?"

688
00:55:53,016 --> 00:56:00,195
"Why isn't your nature
like your face?"

689
00:56:08,665 --> 00:56:10,372
Well played, Doc.
- Hey.

690
00:56:13,269 --> 00:56:14,247
Sir.

691
00:56:15,772 --> 00:56:17,080
What are you doing here?

692
00:56:18,174 --> 00:56:19,482
Sir, I want to talk to you.

693
00:56:21,711 --> 00:56:22,587
About what?

694
00:56:22,812 --> 00:56:24,416
Sir, about Ankur Arora.

695
00:56:26,716 --> 00:56:28,889
What about Ankur Arora?

696
00:56:30,286 --> 00:56:31,594
Sir, everyone makes mistake.

697
00:56:32,789 --> 00:56:34,291
If we hide the mistake..

698
00:56:34,491 --> 00:56:36,698
...and if someone loses his life,
it's called murder.

699
00:56:36,993 --> 00:56:39,098
Which mistake?

700
00:56:39,329 --> 00:56:40,808
Sir,
you know I'm talking about Ankur.

701
00:56:40,997 --> 00:56:42,340
He died because of pneumothorax.

702
00:56:42,866 --> 00:56:44,504
Didn't you see the
death certificate?

703
00:56:45,802 --> 00:56:47,281
He died because of lung failure.

704
00:56:52,909 --> 00:56:54,411
Do you know what you're saying?

705
00:56:55,845 --> 00:56:57,324
You're insulting a
reputed doctor.

706
00:56:59,315 --> 00:57:01,352
Romesh,
if I take this seriously.

707
00:57:03,386 --> 00:57:04,990
...I'll drive you out
of the hospital“.

708
00:57:05,188 --> 00:57:06,360
...and you won't be able
to do internship"

709
00:57:06,556 --> 00:57:07,762
...in any hospital of the world.

710
00:57:07,991 --> 00:57:09,470
And I'm saying it
very responsibly.

711
00:57:13,997 --> 00:57:15,806
Sir, you can stop me from
becoming a doctor“

712
00:57:15,999 --> 00:57:17,945
...but at least tell that child's
mother the truth once..

713
00:57:18,101 --> 00:57:19,273
"That he died because
of your carelessness.

714
00:57:19,502 --> 00:57:21,379
...and not because of disease.
- Sir, please.

715
00:57:21,905 --> 00:57:24,249
Sir, confess this in
front of his mother.

716
00:57:24,574 --> 00:57:27,248
Good night, sir. - Sir, she has
the right to know this truth.

717
00:57:27,410 --> 00:57:30,448
Sir, I consider you my teacher.
I worship you. - Sir, please.

718
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:32,956
Don't lie. - What's the shame
in admitting mistake?

719
00:57:33,116 --> 00:57:34,151
In this profession
of saving lives..

720
00:57:34,384 --> 00:57:35,988
...we can't save life
all the time.

721
00:57:36,186 --> 00:57:39,133
This is the truth.
It's better you accept it.

722
00:57:40,623 --> 00:57:44,332
Romesh, it happens in medical
profession. I'll happen.

723
00:57:44,561 --> 00:57:45,767
Sir, it has been happening..

724
00:57:45,962 --> 00:57:49,500
Listen. You won't discuss this
more. Do you understand?

725
00:57:49,766 --> 00:57:51,109
No, sir. I can't understand.

726
00:57:56,306 --> 00:57:57,512
You won't understand.

727
00:57:58,107 --> 00:57:59,643
I don't have time for
this nonsense.

728
00:58:03,446 --> 00:58:04,424
Drive.

729
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:12,098
Thank you.

730
00:58:13,056 --> 00:58:14,194
The guy was saying"

731
00:58:15,892 --> 00:58:17,098
Romesh.

732
00:58:24,434 --> 00:58:26,311
Hello.
- Hello. Sit.

733
00:58:29,572 --> 00:58:34,783
Do you know dad was asking about
you not me again and again?

734
00:58:35,979 --> 00:58:37,617
I've ordered soup for you.

735
00:58:37,914 --> 00:58:39,757
I was just saying
to Riya this is..

736
00:58:39,949 --> 00:58:41,792
...the last year of
your internship.

737
00:58:42,485 --> 00:58:46,160
After that you've to decide
that in this profession.

738
00:58:46,623 --> 00:58:48,625
...who has to do what. That's it.

739
00:58:49,259 --> 00:58:50,465
I was concerned about that.

740
00:58:52,495 --> 00:58:53,997
I've told dad..

741
00:58:54,497 --> 00:58:55,840
...I wanted to do Cardiology.

742
00:58:56,432 --> 00:58:59,470
But dad says I should
do Neurology.

743
00:58:59,669 --> 00:59:01,808
Riya, mark my word.

744
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:04,519
Neurology is the future
of medicine.

745
00:59:05,041 --> 00:59:08,215
And robotic technology has also
become advanced a lot these days.

746
00:59:08,444 --> 00:59:10,287
And because of that income
is very good too.

747
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:13,024
Son Romesh, take soup.

748
00:59:15,018 --> 00:59:16,224
Romesh. Romesh.

749
00:59:19,656 --> 00:59:20,760
What is this, Riya?

750
00:59:29,032 --> 00:59:30,670
What the hell is the
matter with you?

751
00:59:30,867 --> 00:59:32,073
You realize you insulted dad.

752
00:59:32,302 --> 00:59:33,747
He was telling you something,
but you..

753
00:59:33,903 --> 00:59:35,905
And Dr. Asthana must be
playing badminton.

754
00:59:38,975 --> 00:59:40,682
We're making plans
for our future.

755
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:43,687
But there a mother is mourning
her son's death.

756
00:59:44,881 --> 00:59:46,758
And she still don't know
the reason of his death.

757
00:59:48,885 --> 00:59:50,023
Yes, she's mourning.

758
00:59:50,486 --> 00:59:51,521
Her son is dead.

759
00:59:51,721 --> 00:59:53,064
And I'm really sorry for that.

760
00:59:53,256 --> 00:59:55,202
I'm sorry we're not doing
what we should.

761
00:59:55,658 --> 00:59:57,035
But you tell me, what do we do?

762
00:59:57,994 --> 01:00:00,668
Should we stop living?
Should we mourn too? - Truth..

763
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,377
Do you know the meaning of truth?

764
01:00:06,569 --> 01:00:08,845
We just have to tell that mother
the truth. Nothing else.

765
01:00:10,573 --> 01:00:12,382
The truth that you
killed her son.

766
01:00:13,710 --> 01:00:15,883
You all have murdered
Ankur Arora.

767
01:00:17,046 --> 01:00:18,024
This isn't true.

768
01:00:18,548 --> 01:00:21,722
Today after seeing you I'm
wondering are you the one I knew..

769
01:00:22,352 --> 01:00:23,626
...or the one I don't know.

770
01:00:24,020 --> 01:00:24,964
What do you mean?

771
01:00:25,121 --> 01:00:26,600
You've become just like them.

772
01:00:27,256 --> 01:00:28,735
Like all of them.
- Like all of them?

773
01:00:29,959 --> 01:00:30,960
I've become like them?

774
01:00:31,194 --> 01:00:32,172
Yes, you're.

775
01:00:32,428 --> 01:00:34,465
The same people who make their
palaces on other's graves.

776
01:00:34,697 --> 01:00:37,041
You're just like them.
- Romesh, please don't say that.

777
01:00:37,734 --> 01:00:40,374
I know I've lied to you,
but what could I've done.

778
01:00:40,570 --> 01:00:41,913
I do not have any other choice.

779
01:00:42,105 --> 01:00:44,278
You didn't have choice yesterday,
but today you do.

780
01:00:45,808 --> 01:00:47,344
Will you amend the mistake?

781
01:00:48,077 --> 01:00:49,750
You've to make this
decision today..

782
01:00:50,613 --> 01:00:51,591
...right now.

783
01:00:52,215 --> 01:00:53,489
Are you out of your mind?

784
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:55,354
The you think I'll go
against Shekhavat.

785
01:00:55,551 --> 01:00:57,326
...Dr. Asthana and entire
medical fraternity"

786
01:00:57,553 --> 01:01:00,056
"that too for a child
who is no more?

787
01:01:00,289 --> 01:01:02,599
Yes. I think so.

788
01:01:03,826 --> 01:01:07,296
Then think, if we do this
we both will be ruined.

789
01:01:07,630 --> 01:01:09,735
Our dream, our future, our
career, everything.

790
01:01:09,932 --> 01:01:11,434
I don't care if we get ruined.

791
01:01:13,302 --> 01:01:15,304
Romesh, please try to understand.

792
01:01:15,571 --> 01:01:17,209
Dad gave 80 Lakh capitation
fee so that.

793
01:01:17,407 --> 01:01:18,507
...I can become a successful
doctor.

794
01:01:18,508 --> 01:01:18,815
...I can become a successful
doctor.

795
01:01:19,008 --> 01:01:20,453
I can't just throw
it away because..

796
01:01:20,643 --> 01:01:22,145
...your conscience
is pricking you.

797
01:01:22,979 --> 01:01:23,980
Try to understand.

798
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:27,324
Such incidents happen in this
world of life and death.

799
01:01:30,620 --> 01:01:31,598
No..

800
01:01:34,290 --> 01:01:34,690
Are you with me or against me?

801
01:01:34,691 --> 01:01:35,897
Are you with me or against me?

802
01:01:36,659 --> 01:01:38,195
You've to take this
decision today.

803
01:01:38,428 --> 01:01:39,406
Decision?

804
01:01:39,796 --> 01:01:41,605
Against whom? Against myself?

805
01:01:41,964 --> 01:01:43,102
Is that what you want?

806
01:01:44,434 --> 01:01:46,914
Romesh,
I was also present in that OT.

807
01:01:47,537 --> 01:01:49,016
I'm the witness of that incident.

808
01:01:49,372 --> 01:01:51,173
I too have hidden a secret
of that incident.

809
01:01:51,174 --> 01:01:51,584
I too have hidden a secret
of that incident.

810
01:01:51,874 --> 01:01:54,855
And if this thing is exposed
action can be taken against me too.

811
01:01:55,044 --> 01:01:56,887
I can go to court and even jail.

812
01:01:58,281 --> 01:01:59,453
Please try to understand.

813
01:02:00,116 --> 01:02:01,925
You don't see that knowingly
or unknowingly..

814
01:02:02,118 --> 01:02:03,392
...you're going against me.

815
01:02:03,686 --> 01:02:05,131
You're fighting me.
- Maybe.

816
01:02:07,390 --> 01:02:08,892
Everyone's interest lies in this.

817
01:02:11,694 --> 01:02:13,674
I'm not responsible
for that incident.

818
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:15,766
I won't let my life get ruined.

819
01:02:15,998 --> 01:02:18,444
I never saw life getting
ruined because of truth.

820
01:02:20,970 --> 01:02:21,948
Tell me, Riya..

821
01:02:23,539 --> 01:02:24,517
"With me..

822
01:02:26,209 --> 01:02:27,187
...or against me?

823
01:02:27,910 --> 01:02:29,912
Romesh.
- With me or against me?

824
01:02:30,213 --> 01:02:31,419
Romesh, please.
- Riya.

825
01:02:32,515 --> 01:02:35,325
With me or against me? - Romesh,
you're making a big mistake.

826
01:02:35,518 --> 01:02:38,328
Riya, answer me.
With me or against me?

827
01:02:39,055 --> 01:02:39,921
Fine. Then listen to me.
I'm against you.

828
01:02:39,922 --> 01:02:43,369
Fine. Then listen to me.
I'm against you.

829
01:03:17,293 --> 01:03:18,431
Do you want to die?

830
01:03:19,962 --> 01:03:20,940
Have you gone mad?

831
01:03:52,061 --> 01:03:58,273
Lord Krishna answered Arjun's
question about "Brahma".

832
01:03:58,568 --> 01:04:01,071
God even explains
about devotions.

833
01:04:01,270 --> 01:04:01,536
...and righteousness and duties.

834
01:04:01,537 --> 01:04:03,483
...and righteousness and duties.

835
01:04:03,973 --> 01:04:05,418
In Sacred Bhagvad..

836
01:04:05,608 --> 01:04:10,956
...It's said that the ultimate
truth is known as God or Brahma.

837
01:04:11,581 --> 01:04:15,119
The rest of the souls are
referred as Brahma.

838
01:04:15,318 --> 01:04:17,525
Arjun asks about soul.

839
01:04:19,088 --> 01:04:20,931
Why are you standing outside?
Come in.

840
01:04:23,326 --> 01:04:26,170
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have
come here at this time.

841
01:04:27,096 --> 01:04:30,873
I wanted to give this
letter so I thought.

842
01:04:33,803 --> 01:04:34,135
What is in it?

843
01:04:34,136 --> 01:04:34,739
What is in it?

844
01:04:37,874 --> 01:04:39,854
When you get time,
please read it.

845
01:04:44,013 --> 01:04:45,651
I'll take leave now.
Thank you.

846
01:04:48,818 --> 01:04:49,796
Dear Nandita.

847
01:04:50,853 --> 01:04:54,300
I know Ankur will
never come back.

848
01:04:55,858 --> 01:04:57,565
But as his mother..

849
01:04:58,561 --> 01:04:59,904
...you've the right to know..

850
01:05:00,963 --> 01:05:02,408
...what had happened with him.

851
01:05:03,966 --> 01:05:05,274
Because what you know..

852
01:05:08,871 --> 01:05:10,009
...Is not the truth.

853
01:05:12,575 --> 01:05:15,181
What the hospital told
you, is not the truth.

854
01:05:16,145 --> 01:05:17,818
And you've the right
to know the truth.

855
01:05:42,872 --> 01:05:44,180
He was lying on this table

856
01:05:46,709 --> 01:05:48,347
After operation was over..

857
01:05:51,414 --> 01:05:52,392
Oh my God.

858
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:54,985
He is vomiting.

859
01:05:56,018 --> 01:05:57,224
Oh God.
- He's aspirating.

860
01:05:57,420 --> 01:05:58,899
Nurse, suction machine. Quick.
- Yes, sir.

861
01:05:59,121 --> 01:06:01,761
Sir, oxygen saturation is dropping.
- Call Dr. Asthana quickly.

862
01:06:01,924 --> 01:06:04,302
In such a condition we don't
understand anything..

863
01:06:05,928 --> 01:06:09,102
"Except that something
has gone wrong.

864
01:06:09,465 --> 01:06:11,570
I can not see anything.

865
01:06:11,901 --> 01:06:11,967
What is happening?
- He aspirated.

866
01:06:11,968 --> 01:06:13,413
What is happening?
- He aspirated.

867
01:06:13,936 --> 01:06:16,143
Why didn't anyone tell me that
he had eaten before operation?

868
01:06:16,372 --> 01:06:18,045
Intubate him.
- No, doctor.

869
01:06:18,541 --> 01:06:20,248
There is lot of vomit
Let me clean this first.

870
01:06:20,443 --> 01:06:21,615
Nurse quick.

871
01:06:21,811 --> 01:06:23,085
Oxygen saturation is down to 50.

872
01:06:23,279 --> 01:06:24,724
I can't see anything,
there is food all over.

873
01:06:24,914 --> 01:06:26,450
You're not doing this
for the first time.

874
01:06:26,649 --> 01:06:28,483
What's the problem?
Stethoscope. Ventilator.

875
01:06:28,484 --> 01:06:28,928
What's the problem?
Stethoscope. Ventilator.

876
01:06:29,752 --> 01:06:30,787
Saturation 45, sir.

877
01:06:31,153 --> 01:06:32,427
It's in to trachea, now doctor.

878
01:06:32,722 --> 01:06:34,167
Are you sure?
- Yes, I am.

879
01:06:36,592 --> 01:06:37,696
Reading, Dr. Riya.

880
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:38,961
It's going up, sir.

881
01:06:42,932 --> 01:06:43,910
Check it.

882
01:06:45,167 --> 01:06:46,544
What?
- Just check the boy.

883
01:06:49,271 --> 01:06:50,249
Ankur.

884
01:06:51,073 --> 01:06:52,575
Ankur, open your eyes.

885
01:06:53,476 --> 01:06:55,251
Ankur. Open your eyes.

886
01:06:55,678 --> 01:06:58,158
Ankur, can you hear me?

887
01:06:58,481 --> 01:06:59,585
The brain went dead.

888
01:07:01,517 --> 01:07:02,495
Coma.

889
01:07:19,602 --> 01:07:22,583
No.. no.

890
01:07:31,547 --> 01:07:33,151
My son..

891
01:07:41,690 --> 01:07:42,896
No..

892
01:07:56,806 --> 01:07:59,412
Nandita, she's Kajori Sen.
Our advocate.

893
01:08:01,343 --> 01:08:02,481
Mrs. Nandita Arora.

894
01:08:03,145 --> 01:08:05,455
We can definitely file a
case against them.

895
01:08:05,981 --> 01:08:06,514
It may be tough.

896
01:08:06,515 --> 01:08:06,925
It may be tough.

897
01:08:07,650 --> 01:08:08,628
But if you want..

898
01:08:09,585 --> 01:08:11,792
...we can demand a big amount
as compensation.

899
01:08:14,824 --> 01:08:17,134
What price can they pay for
taking Ankur's life?

900
01:08:18,260 --> 01:08:20,638
10 Crores, 20 Crores, 100 Crores.

901
01:08:23,065 --> 01:08:24,942
That won't bring my child back.

902
01:08:25,267 --> 01:08:26,302
So what do you want?

903
01:08:26,702 --> 01:08:28,010
Whatever happened with me..

904
01:08:29,038 --> 01:08:30,540
...maybe after fighting
this case.

905
01:08:32,775 --> 01:08:34,482
...It won't happen with
someone else.

906
01:08:35,678 --> 01:08:38,488
Shekhawat. The owner.

907
01:08:41,383 --> 01:08:42,760
He's a big man of this city.

908
01:08:43,953 --> 01:08:46,832
Obviously, his connections
will be very powerful.

909
01:08:49,792 --> 01:08:51,066
I hope you understand that.

910
01:08:52,461 --> 01:08:53,997
I do. I do.

911
01:08:59,301 --> 01:09:00,780
But for the fear of losing..

912
01:09:02,104 --> 01:09:03,481
...nobody stops fighting.

913
01:09:06,909 --> 01:09:07,910
And doctor Romesh..

914
01:09:08,644 --> 01:09:10,248
...do you know people
of your medical..

915
01:09:10,446 --> 01:09:11,579
...fraternity will be against you?

916
01:09:11,580 --> 01:09:11,921
...fraternity will be against you?

917
01:09:12,815 --> 01:09:14,158
They'll never forgive you.

918
01:09:15,484 --> 01:09:17,020
I'll file the case.

919
01:09:17,786 --> 01:09:18,890
We'll even fight it.

920
01:09:20,089 --> 01:09:22,262
But if you want,
you can still go back.

921
01:09:22,791 --> 01:09:24,327
YOU can save your career.

922
01:09:26,262 --> 01:09:27,468
Career will be saved"

923
01:09:29,665 --> 01:09:31,110
...how will I save my conscience?

924
01:09:39,642 --> 01:09:40,677
Good morning, child.

925
01:09:40,910 --> 01:09:42,389
Good morning, dad.
- Should I make a cup of tea?

926
01:09:42,578 --> 01:09:44,145
Yes. Hurry up. I've to
go to office. - Okay.

927
01:09:44,146 --> 01:09:44,590
Yes. Hurry up. I've to
go to office. - Okay.

928
01:09:45,414 --> 01:09:46,552
What are you eating?

929
01:09:46,749 --> 01:09:48,023
Corn ﬂakes.
- Very good.

930
01:10:02,031 --> 01:10:03,009
Hello?

931
01:10:07,169 --> 01:10:09,012
Sir, there is an urgent
phone call for you.

932
01:10:09,171 --> 01:10:10,149
Bring tea.

933
01:10:12,541 --> 01:10:13,417
Hello?

934
01:10:13,642 --> 01:10:15,087
Sir, I'm speaking from Zee News.

935
01:10:15,511 --> 01:10:17,011
Mrs. Arora has filed a case of
medical negligence against you.

936
01:10:17,012 --> 01:10:19,219
Mrs. Arora has filed a case of
medical negligence against you.

937
01:10:19,715 --> 01:10:21,251
Do you want to say
anything about it?

938
01:10:33,162 --> 01:10:35,164
Sir. Sir.

939
01:10:35,397 --> 01:10:38,071
What do you've to say about it?

940
01:10:38,300 --> 01:10:41,770
What do you want to say, sir?

941
01:10:48,143 --> 01:10:49,178
Dr. Riya Shrivastav.

942
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:52,058
Sit.

943
01:10:55,851 --> 01:10:56,955
Tea, coffee?

944
01:10:59,688 --> 01:11:01,531
I'm sorry. I'm Rajeev Malani.

945
01:11:03,592 --> 01:11:05,230
Malani will fight
the case for us..

946
01:11:05,427 --> 01:11:05,660
"Against Ankur Arora's mother.

947
01:11:05,661 --> 01:11:06,969
"Against Ankur Arora's mother.

948
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:08,901
On the day of Ankur
Arora's operation..

949
01:11:09,098 --> 01:11:10,702
"Besides Dr. Asthana
four more were..

950
01:11:10,899 --> 01:11:12,378
...present in the operation
theatre.

951
01:11:15,170 --> 01:11:16,274
You were one of them.

952
01:11:18,507 --> 01:11:20,783
After the incident in the
operation theatre that day..

953
01:11:21,577 --> 01:11:21,976
...did you talk to anyone outside
the operation theatre?

954
01:11:21,977 --> 01:11:23,888
...did you talk to anyone outside
the operation theatre?

955
01:11:26,749 --> 01:11:29,855
Dr. Riya, is there anything which
you know and we don't?

956
01:11:31,954 --> 01:11:33,558
If there is something,
please tell us.

957
01:11:35,858 --> 01:11:38,202
Or else Dr. Asthana's
reputation..

958
01:11:39,261 --> 01:11:40,239
...my respect.

959
01:11:40,796 --> 01:11:43,174
...In fact this hospital
will become a big joke.

960
01:11:45,067 --> 01:11:47,445
And on top of that we'll have
to pay a huge price.

961
01:11:48,904 --> 01:11:51,043
So, in case if there is anything...

962
01:11:54,376 --> 01:11:54,609
Riya, everyone knows about your
relationship with Romesh.

963
01:11:54,610 --> 01:11:57,716
Riya, everyone knows about your
relationship with Romesh.

964
01:11:59,081 --> 01:12:00,754
You stay together in live-in quarters.

965
01:12:01,216 --> 01:12:02,593
Many people objected but.

966
01:12:04,086 --> 01:12:06,794
...I said, it's fine.
There is love, so what?

967
01:12:09,591 --> 01:12:10,569
Speak up, Dr. Riya.

968
01:12:12,161 --> 01:12:13,139
Was it Dr. Romesh?

969
01:12:14,563 --> 01:12:15,541
Riya.

970
01:12:17,232 --> 01:12:18,939
What did you tell Dr. Romesh?

971
01:12:20,069 --> 01:12:21,047
Tell me.

972
01:12:23,972 --> 01:12:24,950
Speak up!

973
01:12:44,927 --> 01:12:46,304
I'm taking my stuffs.

974
01:12:49,298 --> 01:12:50,276
And this..

975
01:12:52,334 --> 01:12:53,312
You keep this.

976
01:12:58,774 --> 01:12:59,946
I don't need it now.

977
01:13:15,023 --> 01:13:16,058
I've told them..

978
01:13:18,293 --> 01:13:19,499
I couldn't lie.

979
01:13:21,363 --> 01:13:24,867
They wanted to know how others
found out about the incident.

980
01:13:27,336 --> 01:13:28,474
I told them your name.

981
01:13:30,639 --> 01:13:32,118
You went to the lawyer.

982
01:13:35,511 --> 01:13:37,115
So why are you feeling
bad about it?

983
01:13:39,581 --> 01:13:41,117
I'm doing what I should.

984
01:13:43,652 --> 01:13:45,154
You do what you've to.

985
01:13:47,089 --> 01:13:48,890
Romesh, I'm helpless. Believe me.

986
01:13:48,891 --> 01:13:52,134
Romesh, I'm helpless. Believe me.

987
01:13:54,363 --> 01:13:55,535
You're not helpless.

988
01:13:56,665 --> 01:13:59,544
I'm helpless. A lot more than you.

989
01:14:01,336 --> 01:14:02,713
Still, I've made one decision.

990
01:14:03,772 --> 01:14:05,239
I'll support the truth.
I won't ﬂee.

991
01:14:05,240 --> 01:14:05,718
I'll support the truth.
I won't ﬂee.

992
01:14:07,543 --> 01:14:09,648
Truth? What truth?

993
01:14:11,180 --> 01:14:13,126
The truth which is ruining
our future..

994
01:14:13,515 --> 01:14:15,324
"Because of the past.

995
01:14:15,784 --> 01:14:17,229
Riya, truth never ruins.

996
01:14:19,121 --> 01:14:21,123
You get ruined if you run
away from the truth.

997
01:14:37,306 --> 01:14:37,772
Come in.

998
01:14:37,773 --> 01:14:38,274
Come in.

999
01:14:47,216 --> 01:14:48,194
My resignation.

1000
01:14:50,586 --> 01:14:54,155
Dr. Romesh, you're a unique example
of foolishness and bravery.

1001
01:14:54,156 --> 01:14:54,964
Dr. Romesh, you're a unique example
of foolishness and bravery.

1002
01:14:58,560 --> 01:14:59,538
Maybe..

1003
01:15:02,464 --> 01:15:04,444
...It's better than arrogant
and careless.

1004
01:15:05,501 --> 01:15:06,479
...Dr. Asthana.

1005
01:15:09,905 --> 01:15:10,638
Dr. Romesh, it's very easy
to point finger at others.

1006
01:15:10,639 --> 01:15:12,175
Dr. Romesh, it's very easy
to point finger at others.

1007
01:15:13,108 --> 01:15:15,452
Don't forget what happened in the
operation theatre that day.

1008
01:15:16,578 --> 01:15:18,785
Your hands froze while
giving an injection.

1009
01:15:19,948 --> 01:15:21,291
You're talking of carelessness.

1010
01:15:21,984 --> 01:15:23,156
If not for me..

1011
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:26,687
...Laxmi Gagal would have died.

1012
01:15:26,688 --> 01:15:27,462
...Laxmi Gagal would have died.

1013
01:15:27,689 --> 01:15:30,898
I remember, sir.
You saved his life.

1014
01:15:32,961 --> 01:15:34,736
And I also remember that
after that day..

1015
01:15:35,430 --> 01:15:37,273
...you didn't let me in
operation theatre.

1016
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:41,238
It's correct.
This should happen with you.

1017
01:15:42,204 --> 01:15:43,182
You're right.

1018
01:15:44,339 --> 01:15:46,842
I made a mistake and
I was driven out.

1019
01:15:48,877 --> 01:15:49,878
Now it's your turn.

1020
01:15:50,679 --> 01:15:52,215
So you want I..

1021
01:15:53,181 --> 01:15:55,991
"Should sacrifice my reputation,
this hospital's image..

1022
01:15:57,019 --> 01:15:58,157
...for you.

1023
01:16:00,155 --> 01:16:01,793
You don't have to do anything.

1024
01:16:03,458 --> 01:16:04,732
I'll do the needful.

1025
01:16:11,867 --> 01:16:13,471
You won't be able to do anything.

1026
01:16:16,672 --> 01:16:17,707
I'll finish you.

1027
01:16:20,475 --> 01:16:22,751
When my career didn't even start,
how can you finish it?

1028
01:16:25,747 --> 01:16:27,124
I've nothing to lose.

1029
01:16:29,051 --> 01:16:30,758
And you've a lot.

1030
01:16:43,165 --> 01:16:48,137
My Lord, this year on 9th June
a tragic incident took place.

1031
01:16:48,937 --> 01:16:50,075
An eight years old boy..

1032
01:16:50,272 --> 01:16:52,252
...whose appendicitis operation
was going on..

1033
01:16:53,241 --> 01:16:54,219
...died.

1034
01:16:54,710 --> 01:16:56,690
Because the hospital
his mother chose"

1035
01:16:57,245 --> 01:16:58,349
...and trusted"

1036
01:16:59,214 --> 01:17:01,888
...were not capable to do
even a simple operation.

1037
01:17:02,784 --> 01:17:05,890
And if it was capable,
then it was careless.

1038
01:17:07,089 --> 01:17:08,397
No matter what the reason..

1039
01:17:09,124 --> 01:17:11,900
...but that innocent boy had
to pay with his life.

1040
01:17:12,594 --> 01:17:13,470
Your Honour..

1041
01:17:13,695 --> 01:17:17,199
...that day before the operation
Dr. Asthana was told..

1042
01:17:17,733 --> 01:17:20,577
"That Ankur ate some biscuits
an hour before the operation.

1043
01:17:21,236 --> 01:17:25,685
In these situation, doctors use a
special tube called Ryles Tube..

1044
01:17:26,274 --> 01:17:28,447
...to remove the food
from the stomach.

1045
01:17:28,810 --> 01:17:31,586
But Your Honour,
that day during the operation..

1046
01:17:32,247 --> 01:17:35,057
...this tube was not used. Why?

1047
01:17:36,251 --> 01:17:37,525
Because they forgot.

1048
01:17:37,986 --> 01:17:40,592
The biscuits in Ankur's stomach
turned to poison"

1049
01:17:41,089 --> 01:17:43,797
...and spread in his lungs.
He went into coma.

1050
01:17:44,326 --> 01:17:45,532
Cerebral hypoxia.

1051
01:17:46,061 --> 01:17:48,940
And after 2 days.. he died.

1052
01:17:50,632 --> 01:17:53,306
Your Honour,
the prosecution will prove..

1053
01:17:53,769 --> 01:17:56,875
...that hospital isn't just
careless but culprit too.

1054
01:17:57,139 --> 01:17:59,619
It will prove that what
the doctors did here..

1055
01:17:59,808 --> 01:18:01,810
"Wasn't less than a
first degree murder.

1056
01:18:02,177 --> 01:18:03,281
It will prove..

1057
01:18:03,478 --> 01:18:05,480
...In an attempt to
hide their crime..

1058
01:18:05,781 --> 01:18:08,387
...they're not just only guilty..

1059
01:18:08,784 --> 01:18:09,785
...but culpable too.

1060
01:18:11,953 --> 01:18:13,796
I didn't bring any chart,
Your Honour.

1061
01:18:14,589 --> 01:18:16,569
Nor I'll give a speech
on this profession.

1062
01:18:17,759 --> 01:18:21,036
Because I trust the doctors of
Shekhawat General hospital..

1063
01:18:21,630 --> 01:18:23,473
"That during the operation
that day..

1064
01:18:23,699 --> 01:18:27,875
...Ankur Arora's lungs collapsed.

1065
01:18:28,603 --> 01:18:31,277
In medical term it's
called pneumothorax.

1066
01:18:31,707 --> 01:18:33,687
In such a condition,
the patient can't breathe.

1067
01:18:34,109 --> 01:18:35,782
Vital organs don't get oxygen.

1068
01:18:36,044 --> 01:18:37,580
Oxygen doesn't reach brains.

1069
01:18:38,113 --> 01:18:39,922
And the patient goes in coma.

1070
01:18:40,182 --> 01:18:42,890
That is exactly what happened
to Ankur Arora that day.

1071
01:18:43,685 --> 01:18:45,062
Abusing the doctors.

1072
01:18:45,954 --> 01:18:47,456
...defaming the hospitals.

1073
01:18:47,889 --> 01:18:50,233
...blackmailing them,
is very easy.

1074
01:18:51,326 --> 01:18:54,273
Because they value their
respect and reputation.

1075
01:18:56,698 --> 01:18:58,336
They become easy target.

1076
01:18:59,034 --> 01:19:00,069
In fact, Your Honour..

1077
01:19:00,302 --> 01:19:02,612
...this is a case of extortion
and blackmail.

1078
01:19:02,971 --> 01:19:05,451
And why should we yield
to such blatant.

1079
01:19:05,640 --> 01:19:07,244
...blackmail and extortion?

1080
01:19:23,558 --> 01:19:26,664
You did good by taking my advice
to fight medical legal cases.

1081
01:19:28,063 --> 01:19:30,566
You've made a good reputation
by winning 4 cases.

1082
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:33,273
Romesh had to come to you.

1083
01:19:33,869 --> 01:19:35,906
If you're smart,
we can drag it for long.

1084
01:19:36,505 --> 01:19:37,882
Shekhawat has very deep pockets.

1085
01:19:39,508 --> 01:19:42,819
It's time to get my new office
and your bungalow.

1086
01:19:44,513 --> 01:19:47,653
So.. so what do I've to do now?

1087
01:19:48,350 --> 01:19:50,455
Keep embarrassing the hospital
in the court.

1088
01:19:52,220 --> 01:19:53,756
And go easy on Dr. Asthana.

1089
01:19:54,289 --> 01:19:56,269
Try to save him as
long as you can.

1090
01:19:57,292 --> 01:19:58,635
The case will be in the limbo..

1091
01:19:58,860 --> 01:20:00,533
...the judge won't be able
to give verdict.

1092
01:20:02,364 --> 01:20:04,503
And I'll make sure that the
confusion continues.

1093
01:20:10,405 --> 01:20:13,852
I've to go now.
Bye, my dear opposition lawyer.

1094
01:20:16,211 --> 01:20:20,023
You're always in a hurry.

1095
01:20:20,782 --> 01:20:21,760
I'm busy after all.

1096
01:20:27,823 --> 01:20:30,360
Today we were going to
talk about ourselves.

1097
01:20:31,459 --> 01:20:32,631
What is there to talk?

1098
01:20:34,129 --> 01:20:36,268
I'm married and we've no future.

1099
01:20:44,773 --> 01:20:45,774
I know.

1100
01:20:48,076 --> 01:20:49,054
Still I forget.

1101
01:20:58,186 --> 01:21:01,326
Mr. Bhargav, what work do you do?

1102
01:21:01,656 --> 01:21:03,636
I'm a handwriting expert.

1103
01:21:04,259 --> 01:21:07,263
So tell me, has your experience..

1104
01:21:07,462 --> 01:21:09,464
...been used earlier
too in such cases.

1105
01:21:09,664 --> 01:21:12,167
Many times. So many times that
I don't even remember.

1106
01:21:12,534 --> 01:21:13,512
Oh I see.

1107
01:21:14,269 --> 01:21:15,145
Your Honour..

1108
01:21:15,337 --> 01:21:17,544
...this is a blow-up
of a page of..

1109
01:21:17,772 --> 01:21:20,082
...a ledger with Ankur's details"

1110
01:21:20,508 --> 01:21:22,112
"details before his operation.

1111
01:21:23,445 --> 01:21:26,324
It's written that time before
last meal, 9 hours.

1112
01:21:26,815 --> 01:21:27,793
9 hours.

1113
01:21:28,617 --> 01:21:29,595
Mr. Bhargav..

1114
01:21:30,385 --> 01:21:33,025
...tell the court what does
this page tell you.

1115
01:21:34,522 --> 01:21:37,969
For a common man this is
just a number. Number 9.

1116
01:21:39,060 --> 01:21:42,007
But for me,
it's not number 9 but number 1.

1117
01:21:43,999 --> 01:21:46,036
It has been made to 9.

1118
01:21:48,703 --> 01:21:50,808
By making a curve from here.

1119
01:21:51,873 --> 01:21:54,479
And not one,
but two people have done it.

1120
01:21:55,043 --> 01:21:57,489
With 2 different pens and
at 2 different time.

1121
01:21:58,346 --> 01:21:59,984
When we write something
on the paper..

1122
01:22:00,248 --> 01:22:02,592
...It forms a slight wrinkle..

1123
01:22:03,385 --> 01:22:05,592
...which we can see only
through the computer.

1124
01:22:06,221 --> 01:22:07,700
Normally when a person writes..

1125
01:22:08,256 --> 01:22:09,929
...It leaves wrinkles
on the paper.

1126
01:22:10,558 --> 01:22:11,935
But when he changes something.

1127
01:22:12,327 --> 01:22:14,273
...then he writes with
a light hand..

1128
01:22:14,562 --> 01:22:15,734
...very carefully.

1129
01:22:16,164 --> 01:22:18,644
That's why such places
have less wrinkles.

1130
01:22:19,567 --> 01:22:22,013
In this paper too there are
wrinkles everywhere..

1131
01:22:22,437 --> 01:22:24,576
"Expect near that 9..

1132
01:22:24,773 --> 01:22:27,549
...where the wrinkles are less,
as it was changed.

1133
01:22:28,243 --> 01:22:31,190
Now what can I say to the court?
Everything is clear.

1134
01:22:32,714 --> 01:22:33,692
On the same paper..

1135
01:22:33,882 --> 01:22:37,056
...at the same place two different
hands can't write.

1136
01:22:37,752 --> 01:22:38,856
So it's obvious..

1137
01:22:39,187 --> 01:22:41,724
"That someone changed
this 1 into 9.

1138
01:22:42,424 --> 01:22:46,099
Your Honour, we don't know
who stole this ledger.

1139
01:22:46,594 --> 01:22:50,098
We don't even know if Dr. Asthana
did this or not.

1140
01:22:50,732 --> 01:22:52,439
But someone has surely done it.

1141
01:22:53,134 --> 01:22:54,306
And the funny part is that.

1142
01:22:54,536 --> 01:22:56,880
"As per the time written
in this ledger..

1143
01:22:57,072 --> 01:23:00,019
...If Ankur ate something 9 hours
before the operation..

1144
01:23:00,208 --> 01:23:02,415
...then it must've been 1
O'clock in the night.

1145
01:23:03,611 --> 01:23:06,251
And I don't need to be
a master of logic..

1146
01:23:06,448 --> 01:23:08,621
...to understand that no patient..

1147
01:23:09,584 --> 01:23:12,224
...eats food at 1 O'clock
in the night.

1148
01:23:17,792 --> 01:23:19,499
Today you're talking
only on phone.

1149
01:23:20,895 --> 01:23:22,374
It means you won't come today.

1150
01:23:22,664 --> 01:23:24,940
Not just at night, but even
during the day we'll meet less..

1151
01:23:25,133 --> 01:23:26,510
"As long as this case goes on.

1152
01:23:27,302 --> 01:23:29,441
If we're seen together,
problem will arise for us.

1153
01:23:30,805 --> 01:23:31,783
You're right.

1154
01:23:33,641 --> 01:23:35,848
But I wanted to tell you
something. It's urgent.

1155
01:23:36,611 --> 01:23:37,589
What?

1156
01:23:39,247 --> 01:23:43,127
Not on phone, we've to meet.
Right now.

1157
01:23:45,854 --> 01:23:46,832
Please.

1158
01:23:58,266 --> 01:23:59,244
What happened?

1159
01:24:05,440 --> 01:24:06,384
I'm pregnant.

1160
01:24:09,778 --> 01:24:11,553
I thought there was some
problem in the case.

1161
01:24:15,517 --> 01:24:16,996
Don't worry, the case is fine.

1162
01:24:20,055 --> 01:24:21,557
You wanted to meet for this only.

1163
01:24:24,159 --> 01:24:26,139
We could have discussed this
over the phone too.

1164
01:24:29,364 --> 01:24:30,365
Yes, we could have.

1165
01:24:41,176 --> 01:24:42,450
It's a small procedure.

1166
01:24:44,379 --> 01:24:45,357
Abort ii.

1167
01:24:53,354 --> 01:24:55,334
Today a special news
will be shown on me.

1168
01:24:56,891 --> 01:24:57,926
I'll be praised.

1169
01:24:59,260 --> 01:25:00,432
I'm going to watch that.

1170
01:25:02,030 --> 01:25:03,168
Call me when it's done.

1171
01:25:32,861 --> 01:25:34,863
Kajori is proving
again and again..

1172
01:25:35,063 --> 01:25:36,269
"That mistake wasn't
of Dr. Asthana..

1173
01:25:36,464 --> 01:25:38,137
...but because of hospital's
carelessness

1174
01:25:38,967 --> 01:25:40,275
She's trying to confuse it.

1175
01:25:41,069 --> 01:25:44,380
Anyone can steal the ledger,
anyone can write. This and that.

1176
01:25:45,373 --> 01:25:46,351
Smart move.

1177
01:25:46,941 --> 01:25:48,921
The court can't hold
'Anyone' guilty.

1178
01:25:51,212 --> 01:25:53,158
As our lawyer it's her duty..

1179
01:25:53,381 --> 01:25:55,088
...to prove Dr. Asthana guilty.

1180
01:25:55,316 --> 01:25:56,989
But she's not doing
anything like that.

1181
01:25:58,253 --> 01:25:59,561
That's why I chased her.

1182
01:26:00,822 --> 01:26:01,926
I saw him with Malani.

1183
01:26:03,291 --> 01:26:04,269
Shocking.

1184
01:26:05,393 --> 01:26:08,203
She's trying to trap us very
smartly. Now we're trapped.

1185
01:26:08,463 --> 01:26:09,601
Doesn't she understand.

1186
01:26:10,265 --> 01:26:11,403
...a boy has died.

1187
01:26:12,467 --> 01:26:14,606
She's taking advantage of
that too, for money.

1188
01:26:16,337 --> 01:26:19,045
I want to meet her.
I want to meet her right now.

1189
01:26:37,959 --> 01:26:38,960
Kajori, open the door.

1190
01:26:39,160 --> 01:26:41,538
We know you're inside.
We want to talk to you.

1191
01:26:49,137 --> 01:26:51,139
Kajori, open the damn door.
We know you're inside.

1192
01:26:53,708 --> 01:26:57,383
Break the door! Break the door!
Just break the damn door!

1193
01:26:57,779 --> 01:26:58,757
Yes.

1194
01:27:12,894 --> 01:27:14,896
Ajay, call an ambulance. Quickly.

1195
01:27:31,980 --> 01:27:33,288
Doctor says she's fine now.

1196
01:27:36,017 --> 01:27:37,462
She took Mifepristone.

1197
01:27:39,554 --> 01:27:41,500
She got allergic reaction.
She had almost died.

1198
01:27:42,056 --> 01:27:44,036
Mifepristone?
- Pill for abortion.

1199
01:27:46,928 --> 01:27:47,929
She was pregnant.

1200
01:28:14,889 --> 01:28:15,993
How are you feeling?

1201
01:28:33,541 --> 01:28:34,645
I'm sorry..

1202
01:28:39,781 --> 01:28:41,556
Please forgive me..

1203
01:28:55,296 --> 01:28:56,832
Will get them sentenced"

1204
01:29:02,003 --> 01:29:03,209
...Will you forgive me?

1205
01:29:14,982 --> 01:29:16,290
How it feels to lose a child..

1206
01:29:18,920 --> 01:29:20,456
...now nobody knows
better than you.

1207
01:29:27,495 --> 01:29:31,705
This battle, no one can fight
better than you, now.

1208
01:29:41,809 --> 01:29:46,019
After 3 days Dr. Romesh Verma came
to our house and told me..

1209
01:29:47,315 --> 01:29:48,623
...how my son Ankur had died.

1210
01:29:53,988 --> 01:29:55,092
Your witness please.

1211
01:30:00,294 --> 01:30:01,602
Do you recognize this form?

1212
01:30:04,799 --> 01:30:07,803
This is the form which you signed
before your son's operation.

1213
01:30:12,974 --> 01:30:13,952
Is this your sign?

1214
01:30:15,710 --> 01:30:17,849
Do you sign any papers
without reading it?

1215
01:30:18,379 --> 01:30:19,915
Without knowing what's
written in it?

1216
01:30:22,049 --> 01:30:23,027
Yes?

1217
01:30:23,718 --> 01:30:25,664
No. I don't do that.

1218
01:30:25,987 --> 01:30:27,989
So please read point two
of the operation"

1219
01:30:28,189 --> 01:30:29,463
...guidelines in this form.

1220
01:30:35,062 --> 01:30:36,439
Patient should be NBM..

1221
01:30:37,365 --> 01:30:38,969
...6 to 8 hours before
the operation.

1222
01:30:39,400 --> 01:30:40,378
NBM.

1223
01:30:40,768 --> 01:30:43,374
I means Nothing By Mouth,
Your Honour.

1224
01:30:44,672 --> 01:30:46,117
It's clearly written
on the form..

1225
01:30:46,407 --> 01:30:48,546
"That 6 to 8 hours before
the operation..

1226
01:30:49,210 --> 01:30:52,020
...patient is not allowed
to eat anything.

1227
01:30:52,580 --> 01:30:53,923
He has to stay empty stomach.

1228
01:30:54,615 --> 01:30:57,152
And patient's mother had
signed this form.

1229
01:30:57,718 --> 01:31:00,824
The mother who is accusing the
doctors of carelessness.

1230
01:31:01,556 --> 01:31:04,901
...but she's forgetting that
she was the most careless.

1231
01:31:05,960 --> 01:31:08,236
One hour before the operation,
she let her son..

1232
01:31:08,930 --> 01:31:09,908
...eat biscuits.

1233
01:31:10,565 --> 01:31:11,703
Ask her, Your Honour..

1234
01:31:12,200 --> 01:31:14,237
...what was she doing when the
child was eating biscuits?

1235
01:31:14,769 --> 01:31:17,045
Were you staring her?
Watching TV?

1236
01:31:17,772 --> 01:31:19,752
Or fixing appointment
in beauty saloon?

1237
01:31:24,412 --> 01:31:25,390
Your witness.

1238
01:31:38,426 --> 01:31:39,404
Miss Arora..

1239
01:31:40,895 --> 01:31:42,670
...what's myocardial infarction?

1240
01:31:43,798 --> 01:31:44,776
Do you know?

1241
01:31:46,300 --> 01:31:47,335
It's a heart attack.

1242
01:31:47,568 --> 01:31:49,946
You would know Acute Coryza.

1243
01:31:50,471 --> 01:31:51,848
No.
- No?

1244
01:31:52,840 --> 01:31:53,818
It's common cold.

1245
01:31:54,408 --> 01:31:55,386
Cephalalgia ?

1246
01:31:55,810 --> 01:31:57,084
Have you heard this name?

1247
01:31:57,678 --> 01:31:58,816
I don't know all that.

1248
01:31:59,947 --> 01:32:02,450
Headache. Don't you know..

1249
01:32:03,784 --> 01:32:05,593
"As per my fellow lawyer..

1250
01:32:05,786 --> 01:32:08,596
...you should have got all the
information of medicine..

1251
01:32:08,789 --> 01:32:11,269
...before admitting your
son in that hospital.

1252
01:32:11,459 --> 01:32:12,631
Objection, Your Honour.

1253
01:32:12,860 --> 01:32:14,567
The prosecution is trying
to lead the witness.

1254
01:32:14,795 --> 01:32:15,773
Excuse me.

1255
01:32:17,164 --> 01:32:18,541
Do you know what ED stands for?

1256
01:32:20,801 --> 01:32:22,109
I thought you would know.

1257
01:32:23,204 --> 01:32:24,478
Erectile dysfunction.

1258
01:32:29,210 --> 01:32:31,053
Your Honour, you tell me..

1259
01:32:31,612 --> 01:32:33,455
...did you know the
meaning of NBM?

1260
01:32:35,149 --> 01:32:36,184
Objection overruled.

1261
01:32:36,884 --> 01:32:39,592
My Lord, whether common
person knows about..

1262
01:32:39,820 --> 01:32:42,198
"These medical terms
does not matter.

1263
01:32:42,490 --> 01:32:43,366
What matters.

1264
01:32:43,524 --> 01:32:46,471
...the doctors treating
them should know it.

1265
01:32:46,961 --> 01:32:50,636
And especially a fantastic
surgeon like Dr. Asthana.

1266
01:33:21,996 --> 01:33:23,339
What the hell are you doing?

1267
01:33:25,232 --> 01:33:26,677
What the hell I'm doing? Means?

1268
01:33:26,934 --> 01:33:28,914
You've to drag this case..

1269
01:33:29,870 --> 01:33:30,905
...not win it.

1270
01:33:31,205 --> 01:33:33,685
Really? Did I've to do that?

1271
01:33:34,875 --> 01:33:36,252
Sorry, I forgot.

1272
01:33:36,844 --> 01:33:38,187
What?
- Yes, I forgot.

1273
01:33:38,946 --> 01:33:40,118
Because I'm in a hurry.

1274
01:33:40,514 --> 01:33:42,357
I've to watch TV at 10 PM.

1275
01:33:43,084 --> 01:33:44,722
I've to watch accolades in news.

1276
01:33:45,519 --> 01:33:46,463
...only of mine..

1277
01:33:47,688 --> 01:33:48,666
...not of others.

1278
01:33:49,256 --> 01:33:52,237
Is this anger because of that
jerk whom you had to abort?

1279
01:33:53,527 --> 01:33:54,505
No..

1280
01:33:55,262 --> 01:33:58,436
...It's because of the jerk
with whom I had to sleep.

1281
01:33:59,467 --> 01:34:00,912
You only know how to make deal..

1282
01:34:02,069 --> 01:34:03,047
Nothing else.

1283
01:34:04,071 --> 01:34:05,573
I made you a lawyer.

1284
01:34:07,708 --> 01:34:08,982
You'll stand against me.

1285
01:34:09,377 --> 01:34:10,822
I'm still making a deal.

1286
01:34:11,946 --> 01:34:13,152
The only difference is..

1287
01:34:13,614 --> 01:34:15,093
...this time the deal
is of truth"

1288
01:34:16,584 --> 01:34:17,562
...not of bodies.

1289
01:34:18,386 --> 01:34:20,366
I'll crush you in the court.

1290
01:34:21,622 --> 01:34:22,600
Go ahead.

1291
01:34:23,591 --> 01:34:25,229
But remember, Rajeev Malani..

1292
01:34:26,961 --> 01:34:29,066
...this time you'll be faced
with not 2 women..

1293
01:34:29,964 --> 01:34:30,942
...but 2 mothers.

1294
01:34:32,767 --> 01:34:34,303
Remember that.

1295
01:34:35,836 --> 01:34:37,645
As the women of the market say..

1296
01:34:39,440 --> 01:34:40,578
...we won't touch you..

1297
01:34:41,642 --> 01:34:43,246
...but strip your clothes.

1298
01:35:18,045 --> 01:35:22,653
"There was neither light.."

1299
01:35:24,051 --> 01:35:28,522
"..nor any ray of hope."

1300
01:35:30,024 --> 01:35:34,905
"There was mist all around.."

1301
01:35:35,996 --> 01:35:39,842
"..even the eyes were
filled with tears."

1302
01:35:41,302 --> 01:35:46,945
"Now the cloud has been cleared."

1303
01:35:47,341 --> 01:35:51,949
"A voice is heard
in the distant."

1304
01:35:52,213 --> 01:35:57,213
"Life will be filled
with light now."

1305
01:36:04,191 --> 01:36:14,135
"Life will be filled
with light now."

1306
01:36:18,739 --> 01:36:19,717
Hello?

1307
01:36:23,778 --> 01:36:24,756
Who is it?

1308
01:36:28,215 --> 01:36:33,215
"Life will be filled
with light now."

1309
01:36:49,203 --> 01:36:50,648
Are you sure we'll find her here?

1310
01:36:52,606 --> 01:36:53,880
Malani said..

1311
01:36:54,708 --> 01:36:56,745
...they've sent her to Goa.

1312
01:36:58,879 --> 01:37:01,485
She's here. 100 percent.

1313
01:37:05,286 --> 01:37:07,391
There she's.

1314
01:37:08,956 --> 01:37:10,663
Try to do it, my child.
- Yes, father.

1315
01:37:11,559 --> 01:37:12,503
Go.

1316
01:37:16,330 --> 01:37:17,308
Hi.

1317
01:37:18,666 --> 01:37:20,111
My name is Kajori Sen.

1318
01:37:20,668 --> 01:37:21,646
I'm a lawyer.

1319
01:37:22,269 --> 01:37:23,612
You would know..

1320
01:37:24,238 --> 01:37:26,275
...In Ankur Arora's case
we've filed case..

1321
01:37:26,473 --> 01:37:28,510
"Against Dr. Asthana
and the hospital.

1322
01:37:29,443 --> 01:37:31,980
Roseena. Listen to me. Please.

1323
01:37:32,279 --> 01:37:33,622
I don't know anything.

1324
01:37:34,648 --> 01:37:35,991
And please leave me alone.

1325
01:37:44,258 --> 01:37:45,236
Roseena.

1326
01:37:47,661 --> 01:37:49,265
Listen to me just once.

1327
01:37:51,165 --> 01:37:52,872
A child Ankur..

1328
01:37:54,969 --> 01:37:56,414
...you've seen him yourself.

1329
01:37:58,439 --> 01:37:59,543
You took care of him.

1330
01:38:00,307 --> 01:38:02,947
Didn't he tell you he
had eaten something?

1331
01:38:04,178 --> 01:38:05,282
And you were the one..

1332
01:38:06,213 --> 01:38:08,159
...who went to Dr. Asthana
worried.

1333
01:38:11,318 --> 01:38:13,195
Roseena, do you remember
that child's face?

1334
01:38:15,356 --> 01:38:17,165
Tell me. Do you remember
that child's face?

1335
01:38:22,296 --> 01:38:23,673
That face is no more, Roseena..

1336
01:38:26,066 --> 01:38:27,044
"He's dead.

1337
01:38:31,171 --> 01:38:33,173
His mother performed
his last rites.

1338
01:38:34,575 --> 01:38:36,054
That face has been
burnt to ashes.

1339
01:38:43,017 --> 01:38:43,995
Your Honour..

1340
01:38:44,585 --> 01:38:46,121
...prosecution would
now like to call..

1341
01:38:46,353 --> 01:38:47,855
...nurse Roseena to
the witness box.

1342
01:38:48,088 --> 01:38:50,034
Who? I'm sorry..

1343
01:38:50,891 --> 01:38:52,097
Objection, Your Honour.

1344
01:38:53,093 --> 01:38:55,369
Roseena's name isn't on
the witness list.

1345
01:38:56,063 --> 01:38:57,337
She can not take the stand.

1346
01:38:57,531 --> 01:39:00,740
Moreover, defense needs time to
prepare cross examination.

1347
01:39:01,201 --> 01:39:02,680
My Lord,
she's a reluctant witness.

1348
01:39:02,870 --> 01:39:04,349
...and very important to the case.

1349
01:39:06,206 --> 01:39:07,651
Your witness can take the stand.

1350
01:39:08,075 --> 01:39:10,681
Defense will be given time
to prepare the case.

1351
01:39:11,345 --> 01:39:13,848
But the witness will have to be
called again for the defense.

1352
01:39:14,348 --> 01:39:15,486
Do you agree, Miss Sen?

1353
01:39:15,716 --> 01:39:16,694
I agree, my Lord.

1354
01:39:27,528 --> 01:39:30,566
Tell the court your name
and profession.

1355
01:39:31,298 --> 01:39:32,800
My name is Roseena D'costa.

1356
01:39:33,434 --> 01:39:34,538
I'm a ward nurse..

1357
01:39:35,202 --> 01:39:36,704
...In Shekhawat General hospital.

1358
01:39:37,471 --> 01:39:39,178
But you've come from Goa.

1359
01:39:39,473 --> 01:39:40,451
Is that right?

1360
01:39:40,874 --> 01:39:43,821
Yes. I took a few days leave.

1361
01:39:44,912 --> 01:39:48,189
Roseena, is it true that you
took the leave the day..

1362
01:39:48,916 --> 01:39:50,793
...Ankur went in coma?

1363
01:39:52,820 --> 01:39:53,798
Yes.

1364
01:39:54,388 --> 01:39:57,528
Is it also true that the
same day Dr. Asthana..

1365
01:39:58,058 --> 01:39:59,594
...gave you lots of money.

1366
01:40:00,127 --> 01:40:02,334
Yes. This is also true.

1367
01:40:02,930 --> 01:40:04,409
But there is one more truth.

1368
01:40:05,499 --> 01:40:08,105
Dr. Asthana had sent you
to your village..

1369
01:40:08,435 --> 01:40:10,574
"Because you were the
first to tell him..

1370
01:40:11,238 --> 01:40:13,184
"That an hour before
the operation..

1371
01:40:13,474 --> 01:40:15,351
...Ankur had eaten some biscuits.

1372
01:40:15,976 --> 01:40:16,954
Isn't that right?

1373
01:40:25,753 --> 01:40:26,788
It's okay, Roseena.

1374
01:40:27,087 --> 01:40:28,191
You don't have to fear.

1375
01:40:28,355 --> 01:40:30,335
You can tell the truth
in front of everyone.

1376
01:40:30,657 --> 01:40:33,263
Didn't you tell this
to Dr. Asthana?

1377
01:40:33,961 --> 01:40:37,909
Roseena, look at me.
Don't be scared.

1378
01:40:38,265 --> 01:40:40,472
Tell the truth. Say it.

1379
01:40:41,435 --> 01:40:42,413
No.

1380
01:40:43,971 --> 01:40:45,416
It didn't happen.

1381
01:40:48,876 --> 01:40:50,082
What are you saying, Rosina?

1382
01:40:50,310 --> 01:40:52,916
I didn't know if the kid
ate something or not.

1383
01:40:53,847 --> 01:40:55,849
I don't know what you're saying.

1384
01:40:56,717 --> 01:40:57,752
I don't know anything.

1385
01:40:57,985 --> 01:40:59,623
Roseena, why are you lying?

1386
01:41:00,020 --> 01:41:00,998
Roseena.

1387
01:41:07,861 --> 01:41:08,839
Silence.

1388
01:41:10,197 --> 01:41:11,301
Silence in the court.

1389
01:41:12,032 --> 01:41:14,512
Your Honour,
the witness has turned hostile.

1390
01:41:14,902 --> 01:41:16,108
...and should be excused.

1391
01:41:18,005 --> 01:41:20,713
The court will reconvene on
Monday morning at 9 O'clock.

1392
01:41:21,175 --> 01:41:22,313
Roseena, you..

1393
01:41:22,576 --> 01:41:24,453
Get back.

1394
01:41:47,901 --> 01:41:49,278
I didn't even touch..

1395
01:41:51,939 --> 01:41:53,111
...but you were stripped.

1396
01:42:06,019 --> 01:42:07,054
What will we do now?

1397
01:42:10,090 --> 01:42:11,068
Nothing.

1398
01:42:13,093 --> 01:42:16,199
We've no proof now
against Asthana.

1399
01:42:21,201 --> 01:42:24,307
As of now, we've lost this case.

1400
01:42:43,257 --> 01:42:46,397
Do people die in accendipitis
operation?

1401
01:42:46,593 --> 01:42:48,368
Nobody dies in this operation.

1402
01:42:48,629 --> 01:42:50,336
And we won't let you die.

1403
01:42:50,564 --> 01:42:51,542
Are you sure?

1404
01:42:52,599 --> 01:42:53,577
Very sure.

1405
01:44:01,635 --> 01:44:03,672
Stop. Stop.

1406
01:44:04,471 --> 01:44:05,449
Wait.

1407
01:44:11,845 --> 01:44:13,483
Romesh.
- Come with me. Come.

1408
01:44:13,680 --> 01:44:14,658
Where?

1409
01:44:20,687 --> 01:44:22,530
Where?
- What happened?

1410
01:44:23,490 --> 01:44:24,491
What is the matter'?

1411
01:44:24,691 --> 01:44:25,897
I don't know myself.

1412
01:44:32,933 --> 01:44:36,380
Do you see this? This is vomit.

1413
01:44:36,903 --> 01:44:39,213
At the time of operation this
thread was on Ankur's neck.

1414
01:44:39,406 --> 01:44:41,044
When he vomited, it stuck on it.

1415
01:44:41,608 --> 01:44:43,281
It's dried, but it's enough.

1416
01:44:43,844 --> 01:44:44,788
Enough for what?

1417
01:44:44,945 --> 01:44:46,322
For DNA fingerprinting.

1418
01:44:46,947 --> 01:44:49,450
This vomit has Ankur's DNA.
His vomit..

1419
01:44:49,683 --> 01:44:51,321
...and traces of what he ate.

1420
01:44:51,518 --> 01:44:54,863
But how will it be proved that vomit
particles on this thread..

1421
01:44:55,956 --> 01:44:57,060
...are of Ankur?

1422
01:44:57,257 --> 01:44:59,237
A child's DNA is made
with two sides.

1423
01:44:59,559 --> 01:45:01,061
Half set matches mother's
DNA and..

1424
01:45:01,261 --> 01:45:02,604
...half set matches father's DNA.

1425
01:45:03,196 --> 01:45:05,642
If we compare vomit particles
with your DNA..

1426
01:45:05,799 --> 01:45:07,472
...It will be 50% exact match.

1427
01:45:07,768 --> 01:45:09,543
They'll prove that
vomit particles.

1428
01:45:09,736 --> 01:45:11,113
...on this thread is of Ankur.

1429
01:45:11,605 --> 01:45:14,142
What if they prove in court.

1430
01:45:14,574 --> 01:45:16,850
...that Ankur vomited before
the operation..

1431
01:45:17,044 --> 01:45:19,923
...and this particle
was on the thread?

1432
01:45:20,113 --> 01:45:21,956
If he vomited before
the operation.

1433
01:45:22,149 --> 01:45:23,992
...his medical report would
have Antiemetic..

1434
01:45:24,217 --> 01:45:26,754
...a medicine to stop vomit.
But it isn't there.

1435
01:45:27,154 --> 01:45:28,861
He never vomited before
the operation.

1436
01:45:29,790 --> 01:45:31,428
And after the operation
he was in coma.

1437
01:45:31,625 --> 01:45:33,730
He could only have vomited
during the operation.

1438
01:45:34,261 --> 01:45:36,798
Romesh, you're a bloody genius.

1439
01:45:42,636 --> 01:45:46,584
Your Honour, the prosecution
requests 4 days recess.

1440
01:45:46,940 --> 01:45:47,941
Only 4 days.

1441
01:45:48,141 --> 01:45:49,745
And, why do you want this time?

1442
01:45:49,976 --> 01:45:52,115
I want to prepare more
for this case.

1443
01:45:52,346 --> 01:45:54,952
The court gives 4 days
time to prosecution.

1444
01:45:56,149 --> 01:45:58,857
But this time is only for
the betterment of case..

1445
01:45:59,519 --> 01:46:00,793
...not to delay the case.

1446
01:46:01,121 --> 01:46:03,226
I assure you, my Lord, nothing
like that will happen.

1447
01:46:03,690 --> 01:46:05,226
The court is adjourned
for 4 days.

1448
01:46:07,527 --> 01:46:08,665
This is not a good sign.

1449
01:46:10,130 --> 01:46:11,268
She's up to something.

1450
01:46:11,965 --> 01:46:13,672
Kajori didn't ask for
time for no reason.

1451
01:46:16,303 --> 01:46:17,577
She has surely got something.

1452
01:46:17,804 --> 01:46:18,782
Meaning?

1453
01:46:19,673 --> 01:46:21,675
What could she have got?
- I don't have a clue.

1454
01:46:22,642 --> 01:46:24,781
But I don't want to look
stupid in court.

1455
01:46:25,379 --> 01:46:26,357
So?

1456
01:46:27,848 --> 01:46:29,020
How will we know?

1457
01:46:32,119 --> 01:46:34,065
He doesn't

1458
01:46:34,654 --> 01:46:36,861
I don't want to look like a
fool in front of the world.

1459
01:46:37,624 --> 01:46:39,262
Because of this my
company and I've..

1460
01:46:39,459 --> 01:46:40,904
...become the laugh of the town.

1461
01:46:42,796 --> 01:46:44,070
I don't want any more damage.

1462
01:46:45,031 --> 01:46:46,032
Find out what it's.

1463
01:46:46,233 --> 01:46:47,211
I understand.

1464
01:46:49,536 --> 01:46:51,538
Now this game is going
to get a little dirty.

1465
01:46:53,173 --> 01:46:55,050
I suggest you both to keep
away from this.

1466
01:46:56,143 --> 01:46:57,622
I'll do whatever is
to be done now.

1467
01:46:59,646 --> 01:47:01,250
I've Kajori's number.

1468
01:47:02,082 --> 01:47:04,688
We'll find Nandita's number
from the record.

1469
01:47:06,353 --> 01:47:07,331
And Romesh..

1470
01:47:07,521 --> 01:47:08,966
Is Romesh's number same, Riya?

1471
01:47:15,429 --> 01:47:16,407
Did it change?

1472
01:47:17,364 --> 01:47:19,344
No, sir.

1473
01:47:26,706 --> 01:47:27,844
Go in the ward.

1474
01:47:28,041 --> 01:47:29,019
Okay, sir.

1475
01:47:34,347 --> 01:47:37,157
Yes. - I've Romesh's
cell phone records.

1476
01:47:38,718 --> 01:47:40,197
What is this Techno Med Lab?

1477
01:47:41,421 --> 01:47:43,367
He has phoned many times
in the past 2 days.

1478
01:47:43,857 --> 01:47:44,835
Techno Med.

1479
01:47:46,026 --> 01:47:47,972
It's the lab for DNA fingerprinting.

1480
01:47:49,095 --> 01:47:51,041
Such labs are very
few in our city.

1481
01:47:51,431 --> 01:47:53,104
Any idea why he's calling there?

1482
01:47:53,366 --> 01:47:55,039
In Ankur's case DNA
fingerprinting..

1483
01:47:58,705 --> 01:47:59,740
Unless he has"

1484
01:48:01,107 --> 01:48:02,609
...found vomit samples.

1485
01:48:03,310 --> 01:48:04,186
Maybe.

1486
01:48:04,411 --> 01:48:06,254
What if this definitely happens.

1487
01:48:07,447 --> 01:48:08,653
Then Malani, we're..

1488
01:48:25,499 --> 01:48:27,206
This is a perfect match.

1489
01:48:31,104 --> 01:48:32,082
Check it.

1490
01:48:33,240 --> 01:48:35,117
And let's all leave.

1491
01:48:35,642 --> 01:48:36,985
It's time to close the lab.

1492
01:48:37,177 --> 01:48:39,453
Yeah, sure sure..
Just give me one second. Thank you.

1493
01:49:15,782 --> 01:49:17,420
A car is following
us from the lab.

1494
01:49:20,487 --> 01:49:21,488
Hurry UP-

1495
01:49:22,322 --> 01:49:23,300
Step on it.

1496
01:50:01,328 --> 01:50:03,706
Come on. Move.

1497
01:50:05,065 --> 01:50:05,941
Quick.

1498
01:50:06,166 --> 01:50:10,114
Get up. Come on, run. Run.

1499
01:50:12,572 --> 01:50:14,074
They're going that way.

1500
01:50:35,462 --> 01:50:36,907
God knows what happened.

1501
01:50:37,297 --> 01:50:39,106
When I turned off the
computer last night.

1502
01:50:39,299 --> 01:50:40,437
"Everything was fine.

1503
01:50:40,800 --> 01:50:44,111
This morning entire data and
DNA samples were missing.

1504
01:50:44,304 --> 01:50:46,250
So you don't have another
copy of the report.

1505
01:50:46,773 --> 01:50:48,218
And we can't even do
that test again.

1506
01:50:48,408 --> 01:50:51,355
No, man. I'm really sorry. All
the samples are contaminated.

1507
01:50:51,611 --> 01:50:53,648
But there must be some security
at your place.

1508
01:50:53,880 --> 01:50:54,984
Some CCTV or something.

1509
01:50:55,148 --> 01:50:56,456
You know that's the thing.

1510
01:50:57,083 --> 01:50:59,256
All the footage of CCTV cameras
have been erased.

1511
01:50:59,919 --> 01:51:01,626
I've no clue who came here.

1512
01:51:02,789 --> 01:51:06,327
All I know is that as of now
we've lost everything. - Okay.

1513
01:51:11,731 --> 01:51:12,732
But this is criminal.

1514
01:51:12,932 --> 01:51:14,912
We can complain to the
police against it.

1515
01:51:16,603 --> 01:51:18,378
We aren’t able to prove one case.

1516
01:51:19,239 --> 01:51:20,616
...how will we prove the other?

1517
01:51:23,109 --> 01:51:23,951
She's right.

1518
01:51:24,144 --> 01:51:26,146
But it's a crime to tamper
with the proof.

1519
01:51:26,613 --> 01:51:28,251
And last night they
even attacked us.

1520
01:51:28,615 --> 01:51:29,958
Yes, that's the law.

1521
01:51:31,184 --> 01:51:34,290
But there is no proof
that we had evidence.

1522
01:51:34,587 --> 01:51:35,565
Meaning?

1523
01:51:36,790 --> 01:51:37,734
It's all over.

1524
01:51:40,627 --> 01:51:42,072
We can still make an effort.

1525
01:51:44,097 --> 01:51:45,474
...and only Romesh can do this.

1526
01:52:12,792 --> 01:52:16,330
Talking to you can
get me in trouble.

1527
01:52:17,363 --> 01:52:19,036
Even hospital staff is here.

1528
01:52:19,632 --> 01:52:20,610
I know.

1529
01:52:21,534 --> 01:52:22,512
Just 2 minutes.

1530
01:52:23,503 --> 01:52:24,481
What is it?

1531
01:52:24,838 --> 01:52:25,816
You would know..

1532
01:52:27,173 --> 01:52:28,516
"That we had some evidence..

1533
01:52:30,243 --> 01:52:32,382
"With which they would have
been in big trouble.

1534
01:52:36,182 --> 01:52:37,718
But now we don't have that evidence.

1535
01:52:38,685 --> 01:52:39,993
They were disappeared.

1536
01:52:41,688 --> 01:52:43,190
Romesh, I don't want to fight.

1537
01:52:43,556 --> 01:52:45,058
I've not come here to fight,
Riya.

1538
01:52:46,426 --> 01:52:48,269
In fact I've come to
ask for something.

1539
01:52:51,498 --> 01:52:53,944
Tomorrow it's your turn to
testify in the court.

1540
01:52:57,704 --> 01:52:58,808
Riya, tell the truth.

1541
01:53:00,707 --> 01:53:02,311
You were in operation
theatre that day.

1542
01:53:02,876 --> 01:53:04,913
You saw and heard everything.

1543
01:53:05,912 --> 01:53:07,914
You're the only witness
to the crime.

1544
01:53:10,884 --> 01:53:11,885
My last hope.

1545
01:53:15,922 --> 01:53:17,128
Riya, I beg of you.

1546
01:53:24,531 --> 01:53:26,067
Swear by God..

1547
01:53:26,266 --> 01:53:29,577
...to tell the truth
and nothing else.

1548
01:53:31,237 --> 01:53:32,215
I do.

1549
01:53:33,273 --> 01:53:34,377
I'll tell the truth.

1550
01:53:41,047 --> 01:53:42,025
Dr. Riya..

1551
01:53:42,916 --> 01:53:45,294
...you don't have to
fear anyone here.

1552
01:53:46,085 --> 01:53:47,189
We're with you.

1553
01:53:49,455 --> 01:53:52,664
This year on the 9th of June,
when Ankur was to be operated..

1554
01:53:54,227 --> 01:53:57,333
...were you present in OT?

1555
01:53:59,766 --> 01:54:01,404
Yes, I was.

1556
01:54:02,402 --> 01:54:04,712
What happened with the boy
after the operation?

1557
01:54:07,740 --> 01:54:08,718
Dr. Riya..

1558
01:54:09,108 --> 01:54:10,553
...what had happened
with that boy?

1559
01:54:11,110 --> 01:54:12,088
Tell us.

1560
01:54:15,748 --> 01:54:16,920
After the operation..

1561
01:54:30,330 --> 01:54:31,331
Tell us, Dr. Riya.

1562
01:54:32,532 --> 01:54:33,510
Tell us.

1563
01:54:35,501 --> 01:54:36,605
After the operation..

1564
01:54:37,437 --> 01:54:38,711
...Ankur's lungs collapsed.

1565
01:55:05,732 --> 01:55:06,608
Your Honour..

1566
01:55:06,833 --> 01:55:09,336
...the defense would like to move
for a motion of dismissal.

1567
01:55:09,669 --> 01:55:12,673
This case is maligning Shekhawat
General hospital's image.

1568
01:55:13,139 --> 01:55:14,743
It's keeping an important
and busy surgeon..

1569
01:55:14,908 --> 01:55:16,444
...like Dr. Asthana
away from his job.

1570
01:55:16,910 --> 01:55:18,685
This is nothing but a waste
of public money.

1571
01:55:24,884 --> 01:55:26,329
As prosecution.

1572
01:55:26,653 --> 01:55:28,155
"Has no other witness.

1573
01:55:28,888 --> 01:55:30,595
...and it couldn't prove..

1574
01:55:31,157 --> 01:55:32,864
"That master Ankur Arora..

1575
01:55:33,192 --> 01:55:34,865
...died because of negligence
of doctors.

1576
01:55:35,828 --> 01:55:37,830
So listening to the defense..

1577
01:55:38,498 --> 01:55:40,000
...I dismiss this case.

1578
01:55:40,867 --> 01:55:42,676
The case of Arora versus
Shekhawat.

1579
01:55:42,869 --> 01:55:44,644
...General hospital
stands dismissed.

1580
01:56:25,745 --> 01:56:26,723
Thank you.

1581
01:56:42,962 --> 01:56:43,940
Riya.

1582
01:56:45,565 --> 01:56:46,543
What is this?

1583
01:56:48,668 --> 01:56:50,614
You're leaving your internship
in the middle.

1584
01:56:51,971 --> 01:56:52,915
Yes, sir.

1585
01:56:53,106 --> 01:56:54,414
What rubbish!

1586
01:56:56,275 --> 01:56:57,913
You've done so much for us.

1587
01:56:59,078 --> 01:57:00,887
We can do a lot for
you in return.

1588
01:57:01,981 --> 01:57:03,824
We can make you top surgeon
of this hospital.

1589
01:57:05,952 --> 01:57:08,057
For your favors on us..

1590
01:57:08,254 --> 01:57:09,232
Favors..

1591
01:57:10,656 --> 01:57:11,657
What favors, sir?

1592
01:57:13,793 --> 01:57:14,771
I've lied.

1593
01:57:15,628 --> 01:57:17,005
I've betrayed my profession.

1594
01:57:18,631 --> 01:57:19,769
I can't stay here now.

1595
01:57:20,500 --> 01:57:21,376
This burden..

1596
01:57:21,601 --> 01:57:23,603
Burden? What burden?

1597
01:57:25,371 --> 01:57:26,645
What crime did you commit?

1598
01:57:27,607 --> 01:57:28,813
What did you do wrong?

1599
01:57:29,976 --> 01:57:31,250
Sir, not me..

1600
01:57:32,378 --> 01:57:33,356
...but we.

1601
01:57:38,151 --> 01:57:40,927
We made only one mistake, Riya.

1602
01:57:42,388 --> 01:57:43,366
Only one.

1603
01:57:44,157 --> 01:57:45,966
And such a big commotion
was raised for it.

1604
01:57:47,994 --> 01:57:49,200
What if we made a mistake?

1605
01:57:50,897 --> 01:57:52,069
Do only humans err..

1606
01:57:52,732 --> 01:57:54,040
...not God.

1607
01:57:54,967 --> 01:57:56,446
Still we bow in front of him.

1608
01:57:59,405 --> 01:58:01,715
I'm just fed up of this.
- But you're not God, sir.

1609
01:58:01,908 --> 01:58:03,182
I'm God.

1610
01:58:04,710 --> 01:58:06,656
I've get many people
out of the jaws of..

1611
01:58:06,846 --> 01:58:08,655
"Death whom your God
wanted to kill.

1612
01:58:10,683 --> 01:58:12,321
I've as much powers as him.

1613
01:58:14,020 --> 01:58:15,693
If I should be punished
for my one mistake.

1614
01:58:15,888 --> 01:58:17,162
...why do you worship you?

1615
01:58:17,757 --> 01:58:18,735
Huh?

1616
01:58:19,525 --> 01:58:21,869
I just forgot to use a tube.

1617
01:58:22,528 --> 01:58:24,701
I just forgot to remove some
biscuits from the stomach.

1618
01:58:24,897 --> 01:58:25,898
So am I a culprit?

1619
01:58:26,732 --> 01:58:27,710
And he?

1620
01:58:29,068 --> 01:58:31,412
He kills thousands of children
before birth.

1621
01:58:33,106 --> 01:58:35,484
He gives birth to
handicap people.

1622
01:58:36,042 --> 01:58:37,077
There is no justice.

1623
01:58:40,780 --> 01:58:41,918
Why do you spare him?

1624
01:58:42,582 --> 01:58:43,560
He's God!

1625
01:58:46,185 --> 01:58:48,165
When your God only gives pain..

1626
01:58:48,454 --> 01:58:50,491
...and disease, they come to me.

1627
01:58:50,723 --> 01:58:52,225
And I alleviate their pain.

1628
01:58:52,425 --> 01:58:54,803
So if he's a God I'm
a bloody doctor.

1629
01:58:59,966 --> 01:59:01,775
I'm as powerful as..

1630
01:59:01,968 --> 01:59:03,675
...your so-called God.

1631
01:59:06,873 --> 01:59:09,683
In spite of thousands of crime,
if he isn't a criminal..

1632
01:59:09,909 --> 01:59:12,185
...then I'm also not culpable
for one mistake.

1633
01:59:12,645 --> 01:59:14,818
So yes, God damn it. I'm God.

1634
01:59:15,281 --> 01:59:17,989
Get that clear. I'm God.

1635
01:59:36,235 --> 01:59:37,213
Fine, sir..

1636
01:59:39,138 --> 01:59:41,084
...If you consider yourself God..

1637
01:59:42,275 --> 01:59:43,253
...by all means.

1638
01:59:44,844 --> 01:59:47,984
But right now, it's difficult
for me to even be a human.

1639
01:59:52,618 --> 01:59:53,824
Thank you and goodbye.

1640
02:00:21,480 --> 02:00:22,458
Greetings, doctor.

1641
02:00:36,996 --> 02:00:40,466
You're the same doctor
who on TV..

1642
02:00:42,034 --> 02:00:43,411
I'm God.

1643
02:00:44,870 --> 02:00:46,747
I've get many people
out of the jaws of..

1644
02:00:46,973 --> 02:00:48,782
"Death whom your God
wanted to kill.

1645
02:00:50,543 --> 02:00:52,420
I've as much powers as him.

1646
02:00:52,812 --> 02:00:54,689
If I should be punished
for my one mistake.

1647
02:00:54,880 --> 02:00:56,086
...why do you worship you?

1648
02:00:56,682 --> 02:00:58,684
I just forgot to use a tube.

1649
02:00:59,685 --> 02:01:01,824
I just forgot to remove some
biscuits from the stomach.

1650
02:01:02,021 --> 02:01:03,125
So am I a culprit?

1651
02:01:03,889 --> 02:01:08,668
And he? He kills thousands
of children before birth.

1652
02:01:09,895 --> 02:01:14,503
When your God only gives pain
and disease, they come to me.

1653
02:01:14,700 --> 02:01:16,043
And I alleviate their pain.

1654
02:01:16,235 --> 02:01:18,340
So if he's a God I'm
a bloody doctor.

1655
02:01:19,105 --> 02:01:20,243
Doctor. .
- Later.

1656
02:01:21,173 --> 02:01:22,447
Sir..
- Please go.

1657
02:01:33,419 --> 02:01:35,922
Hello? - Dr. Asthana speaking.
Put your sir on the line.

1658
02:01:36,122 --> 02:01:37,100
Yes.

1659
02:01:38,357 --> 02:01:41,236
Sir, it's Dr. Asthana.

1660
02:01:44,630 --> 02:01:45,734
Sir is in the bathroom.

1661
02:01:45,931 --> 02:01:47,410
You don't have to say anything.

1662
02:01:47,867 --> 02:01:49,346
Tell your sir I'm coming.

1663
02:01:53,406 --> 02:01:54,384
Move.

1664
02:02:10,790 --> 02:02:12,463
Dr. Asthana,
we've warrant against you.

1665
02:02:25,171 --> 02:02:26,775
Dr. Riya will please stand.

1666
02:02:30,943 --> 02:02:33,890
Dr. Riya broke the
oath in the court.

1667
02:02:34,447 --> 02:02:35,721
She lied to the court.

1668
02:02:36,315 --> 02:02:39,819
This was her way to present the
truth in front of everyone.

1669
02:02:40,586 --> 02:02:42,793
The court values her intentions.

1670
02:02:43,956 --> 02:02:47,130
As she lied in the
court under oath..

1671
02:02:48,027 --> 02:02:51,304
...this court orders her
to pay 20,000 rupees.

1672
02:02:56,135 --> 02:02:58,115
Shekhavat hospital is guilty
of negligence.

1673
02:02:58,304 --> 02:02:59,510
...beyond reasonable doubt.

1674
02:03:00,339 --> 02:03:02,182
And this court, today..

1675
02:03:02,475 --> 02:03:05,081
...12th December 2012..

1676
02:03:05,778 --> 02:03:07,587
...orders Shekhavat hospital.

1677
02:03:08,280 --> 02:03:12,251

Crore to Ankur Arora's mother..

1678
02:03:12,618 --> 02:03:14,393
...within the next 15 days.

1679
02:03:17,189 --> 02:03:18,532
And Dr. Asthana..

1680
02:03:18,891 --> 02:03:21,565
...Is found guilty for
Ankur Arora's death.

1681
02:03:22,027 --> 02:03:24,064
Under section 304..

1682
02:03:24,530 --> 02:03:26,134
...he's sentenced to 20
years imprisonment.

1683
02:03:26,332 --> 02:03:27,333
The court is dismissed.

1684
02:03:27,566 --> 02:03:33,448
"Everything seems to have
come to a standstill."

1685
02:03:33,839 --> 02:03:39,721
'Time froze with you."

1686
02:03:40,246 --> 02:03:46,390
"You are so lost in yourself.."

1687
02:03:46,685 --> 02:03:52,966
"..that now you don't
even think of me."

1688
02:03:53,259 --> 02:03:59,437
"0 life, please change a little."

1689
02:03:59,665 --> 02:04:05,946
"Have mercy on me.
Don't be stubborn."

1690
02:04:06,105 --> 02:04:12,386
"Why doesn't it walk with us?"

1691
02:04:12,611 --> 02:04:18,721
"O life,
why do you envy my dreams?"

1692
02:04:18,918 --> 02:04:24,630
"Why are you not like
your reﬂection?"

1693
02:04:25,057 --> 02:04:32,271
"Why isn't your nature
like your face?"

1694
02:05:09,835 --> 02:05:15,979
"What complain you've
against me?"

1695
02:05:16,275 --> 02:05:22,282
"Life seems to be lost
in the struggle."

1696
02:05:22,648 --> 02:05:28,860
"The heart is pierced
little by little."

1697
02:05:29,088 --> 02:05:35,266
"O life,
why do you've so many complains?"

1698
02:05:35,494 --> 02:05:41,968
"The world seemed to have
turned against me."

1699
02:05:42,167 --> 02:05:48,311
"Now there is nothing
left without you."

1700
02:05:48,507 --> 02:05:54,685
"Why does it keep changing form?"

1701
02:05:54,880 --> 02:06:01,092
"O life,
why do you envy my dreams?"

1702
02:06:01,320 --> 02:06:07,498
"What this pinning in the heart?"

1703
02:06:07,726 --> 02:06:13,699
"It brings tears in the eyes."

1704
02:06:13,899 --> 02:06:19,872
"Why are you not like
your reﬂection?"

1705
02:06:20,205 --> 02:06:26,588
"Why isn't your nature
like your face?"
