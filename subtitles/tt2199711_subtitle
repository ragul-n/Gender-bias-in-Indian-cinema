1
00:03:23,736 --> 00:03:25,226
I believed in America

2
00:03:25,505 --> 00:03:27,530
I thought this country
would be my salvation

3
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,575
When I was seven, my dad died of cancer

4
00:03:30,643 --> 00:03:33,771
so my mom and I had
to stay with my uncle

5
00:03:33,846 --> 00:03:36,747
The day my mom died,
I made a resolution...

6
00:03:36,816 --> 00:03:42,652
...to escape this middle class rut
and get my doctorate in the U.S.

7
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:46,624
As if on cue, Uncle
Jagannathan arranged our alliance

8
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:49,957
Conveniently, he was in the U.S., so...

9
00:03:50,096 --> 00:03:51,063
I see

10
00:03:51,664 --> 00:03:56,067
That's why you agreed to marry
Mr. Vishwanath, despite the age difference

11
00:03:56,536 --> 00:03:58,868
Of course it was
a marriage of convenience

12
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:03,534
I don't know what Wiz expected,
but he knew what he was getting into

13
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:07,302
- Wiz?
- Yes, Wiz is my husband

14
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:12,275
- Oh, is that your pet name for him?
- No way!

15
00:04:12,552 --> 00:04:14,611
Everyone called him that, so I did too

16
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:17,552
We've never been a loving couple

17
00:04:17,624 --> 00:04:20,957
I told him from the start
that I came here to study

18
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,756
To hit the books, not the sack

19
00:04:23,863 --> 00:04:27,731
He smiled and agreed

20
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:29,963
He has a great sense of humourthough

21
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:32,333
So, what is your Ph.D. On?

22
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:34,038
Nuclear oncology

23
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:38,205
I had several job offers lined up...

24
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:41,042
But I chose Deep
nuclear research and oncology

25
00:04:41,247 --> 00:04:46,776
The pay was good
No complaints at all, till...

26
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:47,945
Till Deepak?

27
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:51,148
Who is Deepak? Does he
work at your company?

28
00:04:51,257 --> 00:04:54,192
No, no
I work at his company

29
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,660
He's my boss and is very rich

30
00:04:56,729 --> 00:05:00,597
That's not why I started this...

31
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,233
Affair!

32
00:05:03,002 --> 00:05:04,663
I'm not a bad person, doctor

33
00:05:04,737 --> 00:05:09,231
None of my patients are
And you're not even my patient

34
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:12,243
I agreed to see you for Bindu's sake

35
00:05:12,378 --> 00:05:16,644
She said you were her
rock during her divorce

36
00:05:16,716 --> 00:05:19,583
She recommended Peter Manivannan

37
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:21,153
Detective Peter Manivannan here

38
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,653
Quickly, tell me

39
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:26,748
He just stepped out of class

40
00:05:26,926 --> 00:05:29,622
Right nowfollowing your husband madam

41
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:33,257
Okay! Just find out if there's
another woman in his life

42
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:37,301
Most likely it won't be a woman
Let me know either way, immediately

43
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:42,136
If he hasn't, I'll feel very guilty

44
00:05:42,775 --> 00:05:45,710
So guilt seems to be the key here

45
00:05:46,312 --> 00:05:47,244
Alright...

46
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:50,307
When do you feel guiltier?

47
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:54,310
Before or after sex?

48
00:05:54,954 --> 00:05:58,947
- What sex?
- With your secret lover

49
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:03,621
How crude! Nothing like
that has happened... yet

50
00:06:04,797 --> 00:06:06,958
Yet? So it's imminent?

51
00:06:07,734 --> 00:06:14,264
Lmminent? Look doctor, even if
I do it, what's wrong with that?

52
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:18,037
It's nothing new in America

53
00:06:18,177 --> 00:06:21,010
Didn't Bindu tell you about my husband?

54
00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:24,083
He's your husband
You tell me

55
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:29,949
When did you and Vishwanath
stop living as a normal couple?

56
00:06:30,957 --> 00:06:32,447
He's not normal

57
00:06:32,992 --> 00:06:33,458
So!

58
00:06:34,827 --> 00:06:36,021
How is he?

59
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,332
You are the unique king of Aninaya

60
00:06:49,475 --> 00:06:51,238
Child of Gokula
You emit crores of light

61
00:06:51,377 --> 00:06:53,140
In this land of sorrow
you have come as the savior

62
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:54,941
How many times
will I yearn and die?

63
00:06:55,047 --> 00:06:56,912
What should I do
for you to accept me?

64
00:06:56,983 --> 00:06:58,746
Vaakala who has
accepted the worn garland

65
00:06:58,818 --> 00:07:00,843
The girl was tired
of yearning for him

66
00:07:00,953 --> 00:07:02,716
He sent her to
Indarlok as an angel.

67
00:07:02,822 --> 00:07:04,449
Will you accept
the infatuation of the lady?

68
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:07,318
Aayardham Maaya you come
Aaya Maaya

69
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:10,157
Aayardham Maaya you come
Aaya Maaya

70
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:14,290
Aayardham Maaya you come
Aaya Maaya, come

71
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:40,784
Without seeing you, I am not me
No root without a seed

72
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:51,369
Without seeing you, I am not me
No root without a seed

73
00:07:58,077 --> 00:08:11,753
Krishna! Without seeing you, I am not me
No root without a seed

74
00:08:12,058 --> 00:08:17,155
Sky that seen daily is not true

75
00:08:17,597 --> 00:08:23,058
Dream that gives pleasure
is not happiness

76
00:08:23,302 --> 00:08:28,865
I'm not me without you

77
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:37,110
Without seeing you,
without seeing you

78
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:43,047
Without seeing you,
without seeing you

79
00:08:46,092 --> 00:08:51,359
Without seeing you
the heart of the lady is in unrest

80
00:08:51,631 --> 00:08:54,862
No root without a seed

81
00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:56,959
Shaamala Ranga with lyrical love

82
00:08:57,603 --> 00:08:59,833
You are the Linga
who dances to the beat

83
00:09:00,406 --> 00:09:01,873
She is tired without proper sleep

84
00:09:01,974 --> 00:09:03,999
Radha is the one
who is yearning for you daily

85
00:09:04,076 --> 00:09:06,943
Radha is for you only
Only one Radha is for you

86
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:44,449
You have superb hearing, guruji

87
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:50,452
You are the expert, Brahmin lady
Tell me howthe chicken tastes

88
00:10:01,233 --> 00:10:05,135
How do you cook meat so well
despite being a vegetarian?

89
00:10:05,204 --> 00:10:06,466
Don't even ask

90
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:08,163
You know my wife

91
00:10:08,908 --> 00:10:10,637
She loves chicken

92
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:12,607
And I love my wife

93
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,671
I'm lucky to have been
blessed with such a good wife

94
00:10:19,218 --> 00:10:22,153
The story is over
Off you go now

95
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:33,189
If you see like that
how I will approach you?

96
00:10:33,332 --> 00:10:38,668
I stood in front of mirror
and saw myself

97
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:44,405
To join together,
I did rehearsal for...

98
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:49,274
...Hundred dramas and I looked for you

99
00:10:49,415 --> 00:10:54,682
Without expecting, he!

100
00:10:55,154 --> 00:11:00,421
Without expecting, he!

101
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:09,500
Oh! He came from
my behind hugged like a top...

102
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:14,572
...and he kissed lip to lip

103
00:11:14,707 --> 00:11:26,107
She forgot that there
is a world near her

104
00:11:46,338 --> 00:11:52,106
Like a dress on the body
will you wear me?

105
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:57,581
From now on?
From now on? Kannaa...

106
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:03,313
My eyes which don't sleep,
will sleep because of Kannan

107
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:08,349
From now on... From now on...

108
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:19,633
Without this happening
Without seeing you

109
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:25,677
With this my heart beat have ended

110
00:12:28,214 --> 00:12:34,016
Without thinking that useless carving

111
00:12:34,153 --> 00:12:38,419
I'll live by breathing you

112
00:12:51,537 --> 00:12:57,032
Deceit thief, Kanna Kanna
Desired artist Kanna Kanna

113
00:12:57,243 --> 00:13:05,548
Deceit thief, Kanna Kanna
Desired artist Kanna Kanna

114
00:13:15,094 --> 00:13:16,061
Hold on a sec

115
00:13:23,402 --> 00:13:27,065
Hello... Mrs. & Mr. Vishwanath residence

116
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:28,501
Jagannath speaking

117
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:32,704
Hello, Uncle! How's London?

118
00:13:32,778 --> 00:13:34,268
I don't know

119
00:13:34,346 --> 00:13:35,574
- You don't?
- I'm at JFK now

120
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:38,139
JFK? When did you land?

121
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:38,740
Just now

122
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:42,719
You didn't warn me
Fine, come on over

123
00:13:42,788 --> 00:13:44,312
Dawkins is with me

124
00:13:44,423 --> 00:13:46,891
Bring him too
We'll have dinner here

125
00:13:47,126 --> 00:13:49,856
I can easily cook for four

126
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:52,830
Okay? Well, then...

127
00:13:57,469 --> 00:14:00,267
- Should I leave?
- Eat first and then go

128
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,840
I haven't even showered

129
00:14:03,776 --> 00:14:05,403
You smell nice only...

130
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:07,540
You can use our bathroom

131
00:14:07,947 --> 00:14:10,108
Hey! Shut the door

132
00:14:10,482 --> 00:14:13,815
You want your guru to catch pneumonia?
Get going, ladies

133
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:20,349
Two lives are involved here
Actually, three

134
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,325
Dinnerfor two then...

135
00:14:22,494 --> 00:14:24,462
He's probably made dinner already

136
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:28,364
You eat at home every night
Just for a change...

137
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:33,494
Okay Mrs. Vishwanath, what if
your boss asks you to work overtime?

138
00:14:33,606 --> 00:14:35,233
The matter is settled

139
00:14:35,507 --> 00:14:42,606
Go to my office, cash in the safe and
then dinner, I'll take that as yes...

140
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:55,794
Sounds like Uncle and Dawkins need to
brief us about something over dinner

141
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:59,159
But how? In front of Nirupama?

142
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:02,528
Nirupama won't be home for dinner

143
00:15:04,336 --> 00:15:06,668
Did you have a premonition?

144
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:07,864
Exactly

145
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:14,877
Hello, Mrs. & Mr. Vishwanath residence

146
00:15:14,947 --> 00:15:16,972
I know it is Nirupama

147
00:15:18,017 --> 00:15:20,508
I've cooked a fantastic dinnerfor you

148
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,683
Along with a special surprise

149
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:25,951
- Ask me what it is
- No

150
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:28,855
- Why?
- Don't bug me

151
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:29,986
I'm stuck with work

152
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:31,628
I'm at the office right now

153
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:34,665
Boss' orders
I'll be very late

154
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:35,734
Kill joy

155
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:41,729
I'll tell you the surprise anyway
Uncle is here from London

156
00:15:41,807 --> 00:15:42,865
Oh God

157
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:45,410
You didn't even bother
to tell me beforehand?

158
00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:50,005
I just found out
He landed at JFK and called me

159
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:51,681
Dawkins is with him

160
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:54,446
- Which Dawkins?
- Say hello to him

161
00:15:57,256 --> 00:15:57,950
Hello...

162
00:15:58,924 --> 00:16:03,418
Hello, I'm sorry, I can't talk,
got mouthful of food!

163
00:16:03,495 --> 00:16:07,295
That's ok no problem, can you
give the phone to my husband please

164
00:16:07,366 --> 00:16:09,391
- Of course
- Thank you

165
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,832
Let them eat now
They are starving

166
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:16,272
Come soon
I'll wait foryou

167
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:19,344
You don't have to wait up for me

168
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:22,437
- I don't care for leftovers
- I'll make you something

169
00:16:22,514 --> 00:16:26,245
There's no need! Send my
apologies to your uncle

170
00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:30,479
- Who is coughing?
- Oh, that!

171
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:31,680
Just a lab technician

172
00:16:32,024 --> 00:16:34,686
I hear car horns
You said you were at work

173
00:16:34,793 --> 00:16:37,921
I'm going from the lab
to the office with the lab technician...

174
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:40,864
...the Mexican,
it's quite a long walk you know?

175
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,565
You're being a typical husband

176
00:16:43,702 --> 00:16:46,034
Bombarding me with
questions and suspicions

177
00:16:46,305 --> 00:16:48,671
That's all I can do overthe phone,
since I can't see you

178
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:50,071
Are you mad at me?

179
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:51,900
No, I'm all smiles!

180
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,410
You just
can't see it over the phone

181
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:55,070
- Come and show me then
- Enough

182
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:56,780
Okay, bye bye I got to go

183
00:16:58,484 --> 00:17:01,544
Did you see how suspicious he was?

184
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:03,514
Why wouldn't he be?

185
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:07,357
My looks, his age...

186
00:17:07,593 --> 00:17:09,026
I'm also rich...

187
00:17:09,128 --> 00:17:12,291
Suspicions and
jealousy are only natural

188
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:13,590
This isn't funny

189
00:17:14,933 --> 00:17:16,366
What will I do?

190
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,361
Will put the money in safe

191
00:17:20,672 --> 00:17:22,663
Enter into the computer and then we go

192
00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:23,673
Shall I go outside?

193
00:17:23,776 --> 00:17:26,609
No no no open the computer
password is "Moolah"

194
00:17:26,812 --> 00:17:30,873
- You just told me the password
- Ya... of course babe, Partner

195
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:32,817
now pass me the money

196
00:17:33,452 --> 00:17:36,421
Is it safe to keep all this money here?

197
00:17:36,688 --> 00:17:37,814
Why not in a bank?

198
00:17:37,923 --> 00:17:39,356
You don't trust banks?

199
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:40,514
I do

200
00:17:40,826 --> 00:17:43,590
But American banks don't
trust some of my customers

201
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:44,991
What customers?

202
00:17:45,864 --> 00:17:50,892
Yemen, most of the
middle east countries, Nigeria

203
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,468
What is wrong with them?

204
00:17:59,645 --> 00:18:01,408
Can't they stop bragging?

205
00:18:01,814 --> 00:18:06,376
They have to raise Obama's ratings

206
00:18:06,785 --> 00:18:10,721
So? Why celebrate someone's
death as if it were a party?

207
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:13,517
People usually
celebrate a demon's death

208
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:17,892
Try telling that to the demon's family

209
00:18:18,063 --> 00:18:19,963
Why are we worried forthem?

210
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,531
What say youjohn

211
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:25,569
You should go home Ashmita...
before Nirupama comes

212
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,736
Come on I'll drop you

213
00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:29,630
Go

214
00:18:29,741 --> 00:18:35,680
Bye Viz. Jag. Work tomorrow, lets
hope it doesn't turn out to be a wet job

215
00:18:35,747 --> 00:18:37,738
Wejust have to do what we have to do

216
00:18:38,016 --> 00:18:40,883
Or our respect and dignity will suffer

217
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,152
We have a reputation to keep

218
00:18:43,422 --> 00:18:45,720
Do we! What kind?

219
00:18:47,226 --> 00:18:48,921
Good night cuckold

220
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:52,195
Come on let's go

221
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:05,760
Hello, madam! What's
your husband's name?

222
00:21:05,864 --> 00:21:07,126
Fantastic!

223
00:21:07,232 --> 00:21:10,963
After all this time,
now you ask me his name?

224
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:12,968
I thought it was Vishwanath,
a Hindu name

225
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:15,632
If you know, why ask?

226
00:21:16,141 --> 00:21:19,235
I'm confused
I have good reason to ask

227
00:21:20,012 --> 00:21:26,542
Either Vishwanath is
a fake name or he has converted

228
00:21:27,085 --> 00:21:28,313
Converted?

229
00:21:28,887 --> 00:21:30,081
Convert to what?

230
00:22:11,196 --> 00:22:13,061
- Hello, Uncle
- Yes, tell me

231
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:15,963
Nirupama's fatso is after me

232
00:22:16,034 --> 00:22:18,594
- Where are you?
- Me? Near the warehouse

233
00:22:18,704 --> 00:22:20,035
Why did you go there?

234
00:22:20,105 --> 00:22:24,633
Why? Because of Farouk
How would I know I'd be followed?

235
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:25,972
What do I do?

236
00:22:27,045 --> 00:22:28,774
Run! Just lose him

237
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:28,464
What are you looking for brother?

238
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:32,767
Brother, my name is peter,
I'm looking for a friend's house

239
00:23:32,878 --> 00:23:35,779
He gave me the keys but
they don't seem to fit in

240
00:23:35,881 --> 00:23:39,942
Is it door number 9? Oh 27!

241
00:23:40,118 --> 00:23:44,782
2+7 is nine, total of 27 is also 9!

242
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:48,324
Ok sorry forthe trouble brother
See you bye

243
00:24:16,855 --> 00:24:17,981
Brother Salim

244
00:24:44,349 --> 00:24:45,475
Brother...

245
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:50,788
Brother

246
00:25:59,658 --> 00:26:00,488
Brother?

247
00:26:02,193 --> 00:26:03,387
Where is he now?

248
00:26:03,528 --> 00:26:05,587
At the factory! The meat factory

249
00:26:30,655 --> 00:26:31,644
This way

250
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:47,466
Acouple of questions,
a couple of strikes

251
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:49,097
and he dropped dead

252
00:26:49,341 --> 00:26:51,138
We can make it look like suicide

253
00:26:51,643 --> 00:26:54,635
I got his signature just in case

254
00:26:55,313 --> 00:26:58,407
There are many details in his notes

255
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:05,478
Name, address, client name,
Dr. Nirupama, boss Deepak

256
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:08,426
Deepak of Deep Research?

257
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:17,602
Take care of it right away

258
00:27:35,253 --> 00:27:38,620
Hello, Deep? What a mess!

259
00:27:38,723 --> 00:27:41,385
We've opened a can of worms

260
00:27:42,227 --> 00:27:43,319
You know?

261
00:27:44,262 --> 00:27:45,490
Know what?

262
00:27:49,234 --> 00:27:51,225
Yes, that's right
Let's talk in person

263
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:52,530
Come right away

264
00:27:55,573 --> 00:27:58,201
Here? Wiz will be home any minute

265
00:28:08,086 --> 00:28:10,213
What the hell have you
gone and done women?

266
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:12,456
- Deep language
- Shut up

267
00:28:12,657 --> 00:28:15,285
Why did you send your
detective to Farouk's place?

268
00:28:15,493 --> 00:28:17,051
How did you...

269
00:28:17,295 --> 00:28:18,455
Whose place?

270
00:28:18,563 --> 00:28:20,497
Don't faff around with me woman

271
00:28:20,632 --> 00:28:22,327
This is dangerous

272
00:28:22,467 --> 00:28:25,561
Deep, why are you talking
like that? You've changed

273
00:28:25,637 --> 00:28:30,006
I don't mind changing.
I mind dying! I'm scared

274
00:28:30,475 --> 00:28:32,500
Why the hell did you
send the detective there?

275
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:36,011
I did it for us

276
00:28:36,281 --> 00:28:39,978
I thought it would be good for
us if he caught Wiz red handed

277
00:28:40,151 --> 00:28:43,052
- He's Muslim
- Your husband is Muslim?

278
00:28:57,168 --> 00:28:59,363
Mr. Deep what a surprise

279
00:28:59,704 --> 00:29:02,229
Did you offer him anything, Niru?

280
00:29:05,844 --> 00:29:07,311
Are you Muslim?

281
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:11,313
What?

282
00:29:11,382 --> 00:29:14,510
Cut the crap! Trust me, he is Muslim

283
00:29:14,652 --> 00:29:17,018
What else have you been hiding from me?

284
00:29:18,356 --> 00:29:19,414
Excuse me

285
00:29:22,527 --> 00:29:26,088
Let's not argue in front of others

286
00:29:26,197 --> 00:29:26,720
Listen to me...

287
00:29:26,831 --> 00:29:28,731
If you touch her
I'll break your hand

288
00:29:28,833 --> 00:29:30,130
Hands off!

289
00:29:30,468 --> 00:29:33,266
I should be saying that
She's my wife!

290
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:36,797
How dare you come to
my house and threaten me?

291
00:29:37,075 --> 00:29:37,803
Please get out

292
00:29:37,876 --> 00:29:40,674
Oh, really? Come on
Let's go, Deep

293
00:29:40,745 --> 00:29:42,337
No, this is our house

294
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:44,312
You stay, he gets out

295
00:29:44,415 --> 00:29:47,145
We'll get out so the police can come

296
00:29:47,218 --> 00:29:48,742
No no no no. No!

297
00:29:49,554 --> 00:29:52,580
Did you lead
the detective to that place?

298
00:29:52,857 --> 00:29:54,381
Why would I lead him?

299
00:29:54,492 --> 00:29:57,290
He followed me to the warehouse

300
00:29:57,395 --> 00:29:58,692
Hold it right there

301
00:29:58,763 --> 00:30:02,358
Did I say warehouse? Did I?

302
00:30:03,168 --> 00:30:05,728
You mother f-
You knew?

303
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:08,169
Sure, I've known my mother since birth

304
00:30:08,239 --> 00:30:09,137
I'll break your face!

305
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,435
Oh, I get it! Don't insult
my mother in front of my wife

306
00:30:11,543 --> 00:30:14,376
- Show some respect, or else...
- Or else what?

307
00:30:14,579 --> 00:30:17,742
Deep, he can't take all that!
You'll kill him

308
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:19,875
One murder is enough

309
00:30:20,385 --> 00:30:23,718
- Murder?
- Wow, look at his acting!

310
00:30:23,855 --> 00:30:25,720
Why are you acting?

311
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:28,384
This won't work
I'll let them handle it

312
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,289
That's right
Call the police

313
00:30:30,395 --> 00:30:32,420
No not the cops you fool!

314
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:35,597
Fool? Watch your tongue

315
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,697
I'm not your wife yet

316
00:30:37,802 --> 00:30:39,861
Thank God forthat

317
00:30:40,705 --> 00:30:41,637
Come in

318
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:56,480
It's just these two?

319
00:30:57,422 --> 00:30:58,889
Who are you people?

320
00:30:59,224 --> 00:31:02,455
He's my friend! He's here
to ask you some questions

321
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:03,820
Questions?

322
00:31:03,895 --> 00:31:05,522
- Who the hell are you?
- Shut up

323
00:31:06,331 --> 00:31:08,925
No questions! Come with me

324
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,292
Why should we?

325
00:31:10,401 --> 00:31:11,834
I'm calling 911

326
00:31:16,941 --> 00:31:19,307
Why would you hit a woman like that?

327
00:31:21,746 --> 00:31:23,907
Would it hurt if I hit her like this?

328
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:26,239
That's why

329
00:31:27,285 --> 00:31:28,547
What's your name?

330
00:31:31,289 --> 00:31:32,722
- Tawfeeq
- Vishwanath

331
00:31:34,525 --> 00:31:37,961
No hurry, Tameez
Take your time

332
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:41,157
Just keep chewing on
the tape until the cops arrive

333
00:31:41,299 --> 00:31:42,596
It's stuck, boss

334
00:31:42,767 --> 00:31:45,759
Excuse me do you have
scissor, knife, blade

335
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:47,497
Second drawer on the counter

336
00:31:47,605 --> 00:31:50,301
Second drawer
Yes, that drawer

337
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:51,774
Why do you need scissors?

338
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:55,906
Why are you cutting your
dirty tape with our scissors?

339
00:31:56,014 --> 00:31:58,915
Would you like it if we cut our
dirty tape with your scissors?

340
00:31:58,983 --> 00:32:00,541
It's very unhygienic

341
00:32:24,042 --> 00:32:24,940
Hello

342
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:26,000
Go

343
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:29,504
Go, go

344
00:32:30,682 --> 00:32:31,239
Go

345
00:32:31,582 --> 00:32:33,709
Please shut the door
Please

346
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:34,919
Quickly

347
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:36,782
Shut it

348
00:32:57,842 --> 00:32:59,537
What's your husband's real name?

349
00:32:59,711 --> 00:33:03,238
Hejust told me
Some Muslim name

350
00:33:03,348 --> 00:33:04,975
Tell him! Oh, Farouk

351
00:33:05,049 --> 00:33:07,517
What? Farouk is my name

352
00:33:09,053 --> 00:33:10,350
Tameez... Tariq!

353
00:33:10,421 --> 00:33:12,286
No, don'tjust guess

354
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:16,258
The thug will... Sorry
The gentleman will hit me

355
00:33:16,761 --> 00:33:19,628
Mr. Farouk, my name is Tawfeeq

356
00:33:23,368 --> 00:33:25,302
She just found out now

357
00:33:25,403 --> 00:33:28,736
You wanted to question them
I've brought them here

358
00:33:29,607 --> 00:33:32,735
Do as you please, just let me go

359
00:33:32,944 --> 00:33:37,847
Deep, you creep, you are
handing us over to these pigs

360
00:33:42,086 --> 00:33:45,544
He hits me and you just stand there?

361
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:47,616
What kind of a man are you?

362
00:33:53,598 --> 00:33:54,929
You need a man?

363
00:33:55,767 --> 00:33:59,601
How about this one
kneeling beside you? Ask him

364
00:34:00,571 --> 00:34:03,404
He'll rush to your rescue

365
00:34:05,576 --> 00:34:08,101
What can he do with his hands tied?

366
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:09,937
Untie him and see for yourself

367
00:34:10,114 --> 00:34:15,575
No, what are you doing?
No need, sir! Keep me tied up

368
00:34:15,686 --> 00:34:16,812
I will...

369
00:34:16,988 --> 00:34:19,821
Correct! Spit out the truth

370
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:22,822
Yuck! Why? There are
cleaner ways to say it

371
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:25,419
But you must believe me

372
00:34:28,166 --> 00:34:29,497
I swear on Allah

373
00:34:30,601 --> 00:34:32,592
- Nasser is my name
- What?

374
00:34:33,104 --> 00:34:37,803
Tawfeeq is also a good name
Still, my name is Nasser

375
00:34:43,848 --> 00:34:45,076
Did it hurt?

376
00:34:48,986 --> 00:34:50,920
I always get hit there

377
00:34:51,055 --> 00:34:54,354
At this rate, we won't have children

378
00:34:54,826 --> 00:34:56,885
We? Who?

379
00:34:57,695 --> 00:34:58,684
Who else?

380
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:03,055
For better orfor worse,
you are my wife

381
00:35:08,406 --> 00:35:10,169
Okay, okay
Don't cry

382
00:35:12,977 --> 00:35:14,137
Shush

383
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:25,411
Call Salim
I'll tell him and leave

384
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:29,026
No, no one moves without
orders from Brother Omar

385
00:35:30,027 --> 00:35:32,996
Omar? Who's that?

386
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:38,700
Yes, Farouk

387
00:35:39,203 --> 00:35:39,897
Tell me

388
00:35:40,905 --> 00:35:41,633
Who?

389
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:44,801
Hold on

390
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:48,537
Brother, it's Farouk
Can Deepak leave?

391
00:35:50,915 --> 00:35:52,906
We don't know who the other guy is

392
00:35:53,017 --> 00:35:53,779
Who?

393
00:35:54,185 --> 00:35:58,986
Dr. Nirupama's husband
A Muslim

394
00:35:59,891 --> 00:36:02,485
He's living in New York
under a Hindu name

395
00:36:03,127 --> 00:36:03,786
A photo

396
00:36:04,629 --> 00:36:05,220
Photo

397
00:36:06,063 --> 00:36:09,464
- Does he have a photo ID?
- E-mail

398
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,192
- What?
- E-mail

399
00:36:12,537 --> 00:36:13,936
Send me a picture of him

400
00:36:14,038 --> 00:36:17,439
- E-mail it
- Yes, Brother

401
00:36:18,042 --> 00:36:21,773
Okay, Brother
I will, in two minutes

402
00:36:22,747 --> 00:36:24,510
- Ask him if I can leave
- Shut up!

403
00:36:34,659 --> 00:36:37,059
Sorry! Sorry very sorry

404
00:36:45,903 --> 00:36:47,598
Krishna!

405
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:52,203
Krishna? Son of a-
You said you were Muslim

406
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:55,638
I swear on Allah
I'm Muslim

407
00:36:56,013 --> 00:37:00,473
But I'm also a good actor
I got into character

408
00:37:00,685 --> 00:37:02,175
You didn't like that?

409
00:37:02,286 --> 00:37:04,652
Allah Hu Akbar!

410
00:37:05,256 --> 00:37:06,120
Enough?

411
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:10,122
Mocking me?
You haven't had enough?

412
00:37:12,296 --> 00:37:14,161
What's your problem?

413
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:21,003
So, getting angry?

414
00:37:28,946 --> 00:37:32,643
Any chemistry student will be able to
decipher what is written on this sheet

415
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:37,813
This is Cesium 137 and RDX,
we have readied a device...

416
00:37:37,888 --> 00:37:42,552
...to explode at our command
in your city, for the unin...

417
00:37:45,363 --> 00:37:46,557
Again

418
00:37:51,969 --> 00:37:56,065
Any chemistry student will be able to
decipher what is written on this sheet

419
00:37:56,173 --> 00:38:00,041
This is Cesium 137 and RDX,
we have readied...

420
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:03,342
...a device to explode
at our command in your city

421
00:38:10,354 --> 00:38:13,755
Yep... Now Hindi, ready!

422
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:16,150
Wait, wait

423
00:38:20,164 --> 00:38:23,292
Enough! I can't take any more!

424
00:38:23,367 --> 00:38:24,163
Got it...

425
00:38:26,737 --> 00:38:28,136
He shook his head too much

426
00:38:33,844 --> 00:38:34,776
Damn...

427
00:38:36,914 --> 00:38:37,972
Hey hold him

428
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:44,977
Did you get it now?

429
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:46,247
Got it

430
00:38:50,795 --> 00:38:52,729
Send Salim the picture

431
00:38:52,897 --> 00:38:55,331
Get me some water

432
00:39:01,739 --> 00:39:02,364
Tamil

433
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:07,406
Not anywhere near
the bomb of Hiroshima

434
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:09,942
Not even 1l10th of it

435
00:39:10,214 --> 00:39:18,087
But strong enough to make New York
uninhabitable for the next 30 years

436
00:39:29,166 --> 00:39:31,293
I've told them to dub
it into other languages

437
00:39:34,405 --> 00:39:35,269
Behroz

438
00:39:35,439 --> 00:39:37,703
Send it to the antique
shops on 5th Avenue

439
00:39:38,008 --> 00:39:39,305
- Yes, sir
- Munnavar

440
00:39:40,444 --> 00:39:42,912
Munnavar will pick it up in the morning

441
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:43,674
Yes, sir

442
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:45,678
- Be careful
- Yes, sir

443
00:39:48,152 --> 00:39:50,279
Sir, I just got
Nirupama's husband's picture

444
00:39:50,421 --> 00:39:54,221
I checked her files,
nothing on him, on your screen

445
00:40:25,823 --> 00:40:27,290
Yes, Brother Salim?

446
00:40:27,458 --> 00:40:29,323
Is anyone near you?

447
00:40:32,196 --> 00:40:33,891
- Yes
- Move away

448
00:40:38,903 --> 00:40:39,961
Tell me

449
00:40:40,371 --> 00:40:45,365
The man on the photo you sent us...
Shoot both his knees

450
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:47,937
Don't even talk to him

451
00:40:49,046 --> 00:40:51,105
Alive! I want him alive

452
00:40:51,549 --> 00:40:54,985
Make sure he doesn't bleed to death
Bandage his wounds

453
00:40:55,519 --> 00:40:59,216
He should be alive
when Brother Omar arrives

454
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:00,787
And Deepak?

455
00:41:00,891 --> 00:41:03,359
Deepak is here
Should I send him away?

456
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:06,897
- Brother Omar, and Deepak?
- End it

457
00:41:07,164 --> 00:41:10,395
No, he said to end it

458
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:15,533
Not the knees! The head

459
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:16,329
Okay brother!

460
00:41:19,009 --> 00:41:20,101
What?

461
00:41:20,244 --> 00:41:23,111
- What? Can I go?
- You can

462
00:41:23,214 --> 00:41:26,081
But before you go you
have to do me a small favor

463
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:27,344
Hold this

464
00:41:28,118 --> 00:41:29,244
Spread it out

465
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:31,012
Can't your men do this?

466
00:41:31,088 --> 00:41:34,057
They will, but
you'll also help, come on

467
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,765
Come stand here

468
00:41:45,603 --> 00:41:48,071
- Why?
- Just like that

469
00:41:48,205 --> 00:41:51,265
It's a trick to make the couple confess

470
00:41:51,809 --> 00:41:54,334
Hurry up
Don't you want to leave?

471
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:57,446
Hey, both of you
Look here

472
00:41:58,549 --> 00:41:59,982
No rough stuff huh...

473
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:22,267
You must be a big shot
for Brother Omar to come see you

474
00:42:28,913 --> 00:42:29,811
Allah

475
00:42:31,081 --> 00:42:33,572
I'll tell you everything

476
00:42:34,351 --> 00:42:37,081
From one Muslim man
to another, I beg you

477
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:42,284
Before anything happens to me,
please allow me to pray

478
00:42:44,595 --> 00:42:46,062
Okay, pray

479
00:42:48,866 --> 00:42:51,027
Is this fair of you?

480
00:42:52,202 --> 00:42:56,229
You tie up a man's hands
and tell him to pray?

481
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:00,499
Shut up!

482
00:43:07,017 --> 00:43:09,383
Don't take long
Understood?

483
00:43:11,355 --> 00:43:14,415
Azar! Abdul has some bandages
Get them

484
00:43:14,558 --> 00:43:15,456
What?

485
00:43:17,528 --> 00:43:21,123
Our Lord, give us in this
world that which is good

486
00:43:21,298 --> 00:43:24,893
and in the Hereafter that which is good

487
00:43:25,002 --> 00:43:29,666
and save us from
the torment of the Fire

488
00:44:06,577 --> 00:44:10,013
What did you think about him?
After seeing what you laughed?

489
00:44:10,114 --> 00:44:15,916
While a seed sprout
A full form will come out

490
00:44:21,125 --> 00:44:24,583
He is born for fire
He grew up with eternity

491
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:30,328
On a right time, his own
form will come out

492
00:44:44,448 --> 00:44:51,411
Do you understand who he is?
You can see him as fire

493
00:44:51,622 --> 00:44:58,460
He created history by breaking obstacles
Can you remember?

494
00:45:08,739 --> 00:45:15,008
He is not a slave for anyone
He is not a king for anyone

495
00:45:16,146 --> 00:45:22,676
He passes forest without
disturbing its serenity

496
00:45:23,487 --> 00:45:27,048
What did you think about him?
After seeing what you laughed?

497
00:45:27,157 --> 00:45:33,357
While a seed sprout
A full form will come out

498
00:45:38,235 --> 00:45:41,534
He is born for fire
He grew up with eternity

499
00:45:41,638 --> 00:45:43,629
On a right time, his own
form will come out

500
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:47,472
Multiple forms with
different faces (Like God Krishna)

501
00:46:17,708 --> 00:46:19,767
Take the steps and
get out when I tell you

502
00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:23,407
The car is parked outside
Drive it to the front of the building

503
00:46:25,115 --> 00:46:27,276
Two gun shots
Count to ten

504
00:46:27,351 --> 00:46:31,219
If I don't come out then,
leave and tell Uncle "code red"

505
00:46:32,689 --> 00:46:33,678
What's code red?

506
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:36,851
He will know I'm dead
It's a code

507
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:38,185
No, no!

508
00:46:38,262 --> 00:46:40,093
Get back! Else we both will die now

509
00:46:42,366 --> 00:46:44,391
Two gun shots
Count to ten

510
00:46:44,501 --> 00:46:45,559
And go when I tell you

511
00:46:45,669 --> 00:46:48,695
- Two gun shots, Count to ten
- Go

512
00:46:52,676 --> 00:46:56,339
Like small, small particles
he'll reside under earth

513
00:46:56,446 --> 00:47:02,112
While digging the earth
the different faces will come out

514
00:47:07,524 --> 00:47:11,119
Which face he'll take?
Who'll know that?

515
00:47:11,228 --> 00:47:16,598
He'll take forms alternately
from different faces

516
00:47:22,339 --> 00:47:28,608
Do you understand who he is?
You can see him as fire

517
00:47:29,646 --> 00:47:36,518
He created history by breaking obstacles
Can you remember?

518
00:47:59,776 --> 00:48:02,870
How did he escape with
so many of our men around?

519
00:48:04,514 --> 00:48:07,449
Why are you surprised?

520
00:48:08,252 --> 00:48:11,483
Remember, he trained the Al-Qaeda

521
00:48:41,485 --> 00:48:43,919
Wisam Ahmad Kashmiri
Afighterfor the Liberated Kashmir

522
00:48:44,221 --> 00:48:46,781
Son of the late Kashmiri from Pakistan

523
00:48:46,990 --> 00:48:49,857
The Indian army is offering half
a million rupees for his head

524
00:48:49,927 --> 00:48:53,454
He doesn't speak Pashto,
but he speaks Tamil fluently

525
00:48:55,866 --> 00:48:57,834
Half a million rupees is easy to get

526
00:48:58,669 --> 00:49:01,900
But a Tamil-speaking Jihadi is rare

527
00:49:06,043 --> 00:49:08,978
Wisam Ahmad Kashmiri

528
00:49:19,423 --> 00:49:20,685
Thanks

529
00:49:21,425 --> 00:49:23,222
Where did you learn Tamil?

530
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:27,358
In Tamil Nadu
I was in hiding for a year

531
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:32,326
Coimbatore, Madurai, Ayodhya, Ahmedabad

532
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:33,861
Nasser, sir

533
00:49:35,038 --> 00:49:40,442
Wisam Ahmad Kashmiri
Late Mr. Kashmiri's son

534
00:49:42,779 --> 00:49:44,007
How are you?

535
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:47,443
I, I don't know Arabic

536
00:49:54,391 --> 00:49:55,483
He says...

537
00:49:56,526 --> 00:49:59,017
Do you read Quran in English?

538
00:50:00,731 --> 00:50:03,859
- No!
- Then you know Arabic!

539
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:09,268
Welcome to Afghanistan

540
00:50:09,473 --> 00:50:12,601
Come, let's go

541
00:50:12,943 --> 00:50:16,538
- Afghanistan?
- He said "welcome to Afghanistan"

542
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:17,647
We'll be going there

543
00:50:17,748 --> 00:50:20,740
You must learn Pashto and Arabic
I'll teach you

544
00:50:21,451 --> 00:50:23,316
You'll teach me Tamil and Kashmiri

545
00:50:23,453 --> 00:50:26,479
I don't know Kashmiri
My mothertongue is Tamil

546
00:50:26,590 --> 00:50:30,026
How's that?
Isn't Kashmiri yourfamily name?

547
00:50:30,093 --> 00:50:32,926
My father gave me his name,
and my mother gave him a divorce

548
00:50:32,996 --> 00:50:35,396
I kept his name for my mother's dignity

549
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:37,667
I understand

550
00:50:37,834 --> 00:50:39,096
No, I don't think you do

551
00:50:39,336 --> 00:50:40,826
No brother, I do

552
00:50:41,738 --> 00:50:45,299
Fatherless kids are very smart

553
00:50:45,475 --> 00:50:46,407
Like you

554
00:50:49,513 --> 00:50:50,411
Just kidding

555
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:54,078
Are kids who don't even know
who theirfather is even smarter?

556
00:50:54,351 --> 00:50:55,409
Like you?

557
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:02,355
Just kidding

558
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:12,627
- Did you tell him? Did you?
- Why would I?

559
00:51:24,381 --> 00:51:26,076
This guy is dangerous

560
00:51:27,184 --> 00:51:28,412
Mammu

561
00:51:29,186 --> 00:51:33,122
Wisam, meet this
important young warrior

562
00:51:33,423 --> 00:51:36,051
Mammu, Wisam Ahmad Kashmiri

563
00:51:43,967 --> 00:51:44,934
A photo?

564
00:51:46,169 --> 00:51:48,069
How can we say no to Mammu?

565
00:51:48,205 --> 00:51:49,968
The photographer

566
00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:01,048
Come

567
00:52:02,652 --> 00:52:04,142
Nasser, sir

568
00:53:38,515 --> 00:53:42,918
All the ground and the dirt in the heat
senses dead and going blind

569
00:53:42,986 --> 00:53:45,921
When you have war on your mind

570
00:53:54,598 --> 00:53:57,590
Feel the drums of battle
beating in your head

571
00:53:57,801 --> 00:54:01,965
And the only song you are
singing is the song of the dead

572
00:54:02,105 --> 00:54:05,233
I am not a man I am a shell
that's waiting to explode

573
00:54:05,342 --> 00:54:10,075
On my shoulders got a burning overload

574
00:54:11,948 --> 00:54:17,909
Guns on our shoulders,
our life is unlucky

575
00:54:19,789 --> 00:54:21,882
Always death is before us

576
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:26,088
We will win this battle now

577
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:45,813
We didn't choose war

578
00:54:45,915 --> 00:54:49,908
But war chose us

579
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:57,893
Weapons are not in our hand
but we are in its hand

580
00:54:57,961 --> 00:55:01,692
Doing rehearsal for war
which saves world

581
00:55:01,765 --> 00:55:05,724
We promise death is our life

582
00:55:05,935 --> 00:55:09,803
Camel's back is not a plane surface

583
00:55:09,873 --> 00:55:13,900
In dollar world, there is no justice

584
00:55:16,112 --> 00:55:22,017
Without getting justice
wars doesn't end

585
00:55:23,853 --> 00:55:29,951
Guns on our shoulders,
Our life is unlucky

586
00:55:31,995 --> 00:55:34,623
Always death is before us

587
00:55:36,199 --> 00:55:38,633
we will win this battle now

588
00:55:45,842 --> 00:55:49,642
With a rifle in your hand
It's down to man to man

589
00:55:49,779 --> 00:55:53,647
To live you got to let die
I'll bear the sky for a nine

590
00:55:53,817 --> 00:55:57,719
You can't afford to fail
got to fight it to the nail

591
00:55:57,987 --> 00:56:03,084
Got to live the warrior's code
Can't afford to look back down the road

592
00:56:17,941 --> 00:56:21,741
We roam, sleeping with Gun as a pillow

593
00:56:21,811 --> 00:56:25,747
We roam, carrying death in our shoulders

594
00:56:25,815 --> 00:56:29,774
Camel's back is not a plane surface

595
00:56:29,853 --> 00:56:33,846
In dollar world, there is no justice

596
00:56:36,259 --> 00:56:42,164
Without getting justice
war's doesn't end

597
00:57:01,151 --> 00:57:02,140
Father!

598
00:57:06,723 --> 00:57:09,351
DOCTORS WITHOUT BORDERS

599
00:57:17,734 --> 00:57:18,962
Welcome home

600
00:57:20,103 --> 00:57:21,001
Khadija!

601
00:57:21,104 --> 00:57:24,972
- Whose horse is this?
- The doctor is inside

602
00:57:26,810 --> 00:57:30,143
- Our healer?
- Well... No, the doctor

603
00:57:33,249 --> 00:57:35,444
No no no... you sit, you sit

604
00:57:36,953 --> 00:57:38,318
Is that your husband?

605
00:57:39,923 --> 00:57:45,190
I'm doctor Clara, your wife just got
asthma attack but she is gonna be ok

606
00:57:46,262 --> 00:57:47,524
Do you speak English?

607
00:57:48,331 --> 00:57:50,799
Yes I do, woman

608
00:57:52,035 --> 00:57:57,098
Now coveryourfeet, cover your
face and get out of my village

609
00:57:57,407 --> 00:57:59,875
Damn! I was just trying to help

610
00:58:00,844 --> 00:58:02,471
I'm really sorry

611
00:58:09,419 --> 00:58:10,443
Jalal

612
00:58:16,426 --> 00:58:19,395
It's alright to call a doctor
when you are suffering

613
00:58:21,064 --> 00:58:24,192
My mother was an asthmatic,
that's why I...

614
00:58:26,236 --> 00:58:32,072
You are right, but we are holding
American prisoners at a nearby village

615
00:58:33,076 --> 00:58:36,307
She is a white woman
Why invite trouble?

616
00:58:37,614 --> 00:58:40,378
Yes! My wife Khadija

617
00:58:41,251 --> 00:58:45,517
- Hello, father!
- Nasser! You've grown so much!

618
00:58:48,324 --> 00:58:50,952
Wisam! This is my future, Nasser

619
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:53,128
Greet your uncle

620
00:58:53,296 --> 00:58:55,457
Peace be with you, uncle
How are you?

621
00:58:55,965 --> 00:58:58,365
I am... and how are...

622
00:59:00,570 --> 00:59:03,061
Uncle does not speak Pashto

623
00:59:03,339 --> 00:59:05,432
Then what language do you speak?

624
00:59:06,943 --> 00:59:09,377
Wow you speak English?

625
00:59:10,046 --> 00:59:13,209
It's his mother's doing
Treachery

626
00:59:14,584 --> 00:59:16,882
Do you still speak to him in English?

627
00:59:16,986 --> 00:59:20,581
No! Not afteryou told me not to

628
00:59:22,525 --> 00:59:25,585
So Jalal is the culprit!

629
00:59:26,596 --> 00:59:28,826
Come here

630
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:39,838
Did you teach Nasser English?

631
00:59:40,009 --> 00:59:43,536
I didn't teach him English
He learned it at school

632
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:44,647
School?

633
00:59:44,914 --> 00:59:46,643
Oh, he learned it at school

634
00:59:46,950 --> 00:59:50,647
Nonsense
I shut the school down a year ago

635
00:59:51,054 --> 00:59:52,248
He...

636
00:59:53,556 --> 00:59:55,285
Is the English teacher

637
00:59:56,626 --> 00:59:58,025
Hold this

638
01:00:00,897 --> 01:00:06,335
If you teach him one
more word of English

639
01:00:06,936 --> 01:00:10,269
you will be hopping for
the rest of your life

640
01:00:17,146 --> 01:00:18,078
Go!

641
01:00:23,186 --> 01:00:27,589
My relative! He wants to
be an engineer in England

642
01:00:28,124 --> 01:00:31,525
when engineers are choosing
to be Jihadis in Afghanistan

643
01:00:34,063 --> 01:00:36,998
Wisam, whatever language
Nasser speaks!

644
01:00:38,701 --> 01:00:42,535
He'll become a warrior
like his father

645
01:00:45,308 --> 01:00:46,468
Like mamu!

646
01:00:51,114 --> 01:00:53,480
- You wanna become a warrior?
- No

647
01:00:54,050 --> 01:00:54,675
Then?

648
01:00:55,051 --> 01:00:56,643
I wanna become a doctor

649
01:01:02,291 --> 01:01:03,280
What?

650
01:01:11,634 --> 01:01:13,431
I'm not a child

651
01:01:22,412 --> 01:01:24,437
Push me, push me

652
01:01:25,481 --> 01:01:26,675
Push me

653
01:02:25,341 --> 01:02:27,138
NATO has attacked

654
01:02:27,844 --> 01:02:29,402
- When?
- Now

655
01:02:57,106 --> 01:02:59,597
They thought the Americans were here

656
01:02:59,742 --> 01:03:01,209
They were fooled

657
01:03:02,311 --> 01:03:05,337
Weren't the American prisoners here?

658
01:03:05,481 --> 01:03:06,778
You think I'm stupid?

659
01:03:07,517 --> 01:03:11,180
I never keep them in one
place for more than two weeks

660
01:03:11,487 --> 01:03:14,183
They were here until last week

661
01:03:15,558 --> 01:03:18,356
The sin of murdering
innocent souls is on them

662
01:03:36,913 --> 01:03:46,720
There is a place far away
I want to go there some day

663
01:03:48,257 --> 01:03:58,497
There is a place far away
I want to go there some day

664
01:04:06,609 --> 01:04:08,474
First came the British

665
01:04:09,412 --> 01:04:12,848
Then the Russians
The Taliban

666
01:04:13,149 --> 01:04:15,174
The Americans... And now you all!

667
01:04:15,284 --> 01:04:18,742
- Shush!
- Go shush your mother

668
01:04:19,355 --> 01:04:22,620
Men are nothing but
monkeys with tails in the front

669
01:04:22,725 --> 01:04:32,726
Where atom was sown
you'll reap atom only

670
01:04:33,569 --> 01:04:39,667
If the sea of greed erupts,
there won't be place to live on earth

671
01:04:41,811 --> 01:04:49,217
No new houses have been
built in atmosphere

672
01:04:50,853 --> 01:05:01,661
The one going to war
is a mother's son

673
01:05:01,731 --> 01:05:14,701
If anyone of us dies,
some mother is sure to cry... see!

674
01:07:19,468 --> 01:07:20,833
Where are we going?

675
01:07:21,337 --> 01:07:22,895
Where the American prisoners are

676
01:07:22,972 --> 01:07:24,701
- Are they here?
- Yes

677
01:07:24,774 --> 01:07:27,572
- Since when?
- It's been a while

678
01:07:35,117 --> 01:07:38,678
Hey Jo! Jo! Caption

679
01:07:41,090 --> 01:07:43,888
Yes you, get up

680
01:07:46,028 --> 01:07:47,052
Come out

681
01:08:01,911 --> 01:08:07,645
Do you now agree, what America
has done to our country is wrong?

682
01:08:08,617 --> 01:08:09,481
Say it

683
01:08:10,486 --> 01:08:11,919
- Say it
- Yes

684
01:08:12,121 --> 01:08:17,684
Thank you, now we will
do the same with you

685
01:08:21,664 --> 01:08:22,926
But if you continue...

686
01:10:19,982 --> 01:10:22,075
Open your mouth, good girl

687
01:10:25,854 --> 01:10:26,684
Ok

688
01:10:28,123 --> 01:10:29,920
Ask her what she's suffering from

689
01:10:31,126 --> 01:10:32,855
Photo photo

690
01:10:41,637 --> 01:10:42,865
Where's the doctor?

691
01:10:43,806 --> 01:10:45,034
She's dead

692
01:10:45,941 --> 01:10:47,670
He'll have to become the next doctor

693
01:11:42,398 --> 01:11:44,263
Nasser, come!

694
01:12:00,716 --> 01:12:01,740
I took the picture

695
01:12:01,850 --> 01:12:03,010
Go, Go

696
01:12:06,088 --> 01:12:07,680
Run! Run!

697
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,934
Hey, Nasser

698
01:12:51,767 --> 01:12:54,292
The elders are gathering
for a conference tomorrow

699
01:12:54,403 --> 01:12:55,927
He will also be there

700
01:12:56,205 --> 01:12:57,297
He who?

701
01:12:59,708 --> 01:13:02,233
The tall guy! Our sheik

702
01:13:03,212 --> 01:13:06,978
I'd be honored to meet him

703
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:12,244
Americans

704
01:13:16,091 --> 01:13:21,723
He started out with two
acres and now has 2,000 acres

705
01:13:25,801 --> 01:13:27,792
Any currency

706
01:13:28,437 --> 01:13:32,168
Tawfeeq is ourtreasurer,
sent to us by Allah

707
01:13:42,951 --> 01:13:44,714
Tawfeeq, here is Nasser

708
01:13:44,787 --> 01:13:46,345
Here he comes

709
01:13:51,260 --> 01:13:54,252
Tawfeeq is not a Jihadi

710
01:13:58,834 --> 01:14:01,064
But he is useful

711
01:14:04,239 --> 01:14:06,969
Everybody knows you here
You might know some of them too

712
01:14:07,042 --> 01:14:09,067
I believe I might

713
01:14:09,178 --> 01:14:12,409
- Dear Nasser
- Oh, Omar

714
01:14:13,248 --> 01:14:15,808
Wisam Ahmad Kashmiri

715
01:14:16,185 --> 01:14:18,176
Great warrior!

716
01:14:22,157 --> 01:14:23,146
Come

717
01:14:26,094 --> 01:14:27,220
Meet my mother

718
01:14:27,296 --> 01:14:29,821
Mother, this is Wisam Ahmad Kashmiri

719
01:14:39,842 --> 01:14:42,470
She is saying you are Allah's warrior

720
01:14:42,778 --> 01:14:45,372
and many generations will...

721
01:14:46,515 --> 01:14:48,073
How do you say "dua?"

722
01:14:48,450 --> 01:14:50,884
- Bless
- Will bless you

723
01:14:51,887 --> 01:14:54,515
Are you as good as yourfather?

724
01:14:56,492 --> 01:14:59,290
- No
- Why you not good as your...

725
01:15:01,330 --> 01:15:03,560
Oh! May Allah forgive me
Forgive me

726
01:15:03,832 --> 01:15:06,027
Sorry! Excuse me

727
01:15:09,838 --> 01:15:13,365
A humble gift from humble farmer

728
01:15:13,542 --> 01:15:15,100
Just a simple gift

729
01:15:15,878 --> 01:15:22,977
Opium but lot of worth in America,
London, France, Pakistan and India

730
01:15:24,319 --> 01:15:25,946
Don't corrupt my warriors

731
01:15:26,088 --> 01:15:27,953
It's a simple gift

732
01:15:29,291 --> 01:15:32,590
Yourfriendship is worth more
than whateveryou can give me

733
01:15:32,828 --> 01:15:35,126
- So forget me
- Forgive!

734
01:15:35,230 --> 01:15:39,326
- Oh oh... forgive me
- You don't have to do this

735
01:15:39,535 --> 01:15:40,832
Mother

736
01:15:43,038 --> 01:15:45,006
Have these sweets

737
01:15:46,008 --> 01:15:47,566
What was that?

738
01:15:51,480 --> 01:15:52,845
Put it in the bag

739
01:15:54,016 --> 01:15:55,176
The Pakistani

740
01:15:55,851 --> 01:15:56,875
Omar!

741
01:16:27,149 --> 01:16:28,844
Let's go, let's go!

742
01:17:13,362 --> 01:17:14,454
Come

743
01:18:05,080 --> 01:18:06,012
Is he...

744
01:18:07,616 --> 01:18:09,015
He is

745
01:18:10,686 --> 01:18:13,519
Not everyone is this fortunate

746
01:18:13,588 --> 01:18:15,681
Move! Move!

747
01:18:23,565 --> 01:18:28,059
- Who is this man?
- Munnavar, a Pakistani

748
01:18:28,470 --> 01:18:31,735
He must have some
information from ISI

749
01:18:33,408 --> 01:18:35,239
He works for ISI?

750
01:18:36,044 --> 01:18:39,411
He works for money
Anyone's money

751
01:18:41,616 --> 01:18:44,551
He's like a rodent
scavenging everywhere

752
01:18:45,620 --> 01:18:49,215
One day in the gutter,
the next, in the kitchen

753
01:18:54,529 --> 01:18:55,689
Americans

754
01:18:57,132 --> 01:18:59,327
Let's go! Let's go!

755
01:19:42,611 --> 01:19:43,737
What's he saying?

756
01:19:44,212 --> 01:19:46,146
We are fighting forAllah

757
01:19:46,448 --> 01:19:48,416
Americans are fighting for oil

758
01:19:48,550 --> 01:19:53,647
If you let them lay the pipelines
they'll be saying Allah Hu Akbar with us!

759
01:19:54,256 --> 01:19:56,690
Allah Hu Akbar!

760
01:20:02,264 --> 01:20:03,322
Let's go

761
01:20:05,801 --> 01:20:07,200
Let's go, let's go!

762
01:21:04,526 --> 01:21:07,290
Where is Sheik Osama?
Shouldn't we protect him?

763
01:21:07,395 --> 01:21:09,420
No! He needs time to get away

764
01:21:09,531 --> 01:21:12,159
We need to hold
the Americans back until then

765
01:21:14,202 --> 01:21:17,296
Americans? Is there another
escape route from the cave?

766
01:21:17,405 --> 01:21:18,429
Yes

767
01:21:19,441 --> 01:21:20,840
- What?
- Yes!

768
01:21:45,267 --> 01:21:46,359
Father!

769
01:21:48,336 --> 01:21:50,497
Go! Go!

770
01:21:50,605 --> 01:21:51,731
Go inside!

771
01:21:55,944 --> 01:21:57,912
Omar! Wisam!

772
01:22:56,604 --> 01:22:59,664
No, no
The Americans are everywhere

773
01:22:59,941 --> 01:23:01,568
We have to get away

774
01:23:01,676 --> 01:23:03,769
I'll be back with two vehicles
You stay right here

775
01:23:03,878 --> 01:23:04,867
Wisam!

776
01:23:05,480 --> 01:23:07,914
Nasser, Khadija, Jalal...

777
01:23:08,049 --> 01:23:10,381
Don't worry
They'll be alright, God willing

778
01:23:10,452 --> 01:23:11,612
I'll handle it

779
01:23:39,114 --> 01:23:40,638
lmtiaz, stay here

780
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:48,514
We need to protect
Sheik Osama! Let's go

781
01:23:48,590 --> 01:23:52,651
- Yes, let's go to our Sheik
- No one can catch Osama now

782
01:23:52,727 --> 01:23:54,388
Brother Omar, you are our leader

783
01:23:54,462 --> 01:23:56,987
- Let's stand and fight
- What's going on here?

784
01:23:57,065 --> 01:24:00,034
Americans will not
kill women and children

785
01:24:00,135 --> 01:24:02,330
They need us alive

786
01:24:02,937 --> 01:24:05,428
They need their prisoners alive

787
01:24:05,540 --> 01:24:08,998
- Kill the American prisoners first
- I'll take care of that! You go

788
01:24:09,110 --> 01:24:10,509
- Me too
- No!

789
01:24:10,712 --> 01:24:12,771
If anything happens
to Brother Omar, we...

790
01:24:23,024 --> 01:24:24,821
You scoundrel!

791
01:25:04,132 --> 01:25:06,498
Take him to the hospital
Take the highway

792
01:25:06,601 --> 01:25:09,161
- And you?
- I'll stay with Khadija, Nasser, and Jalal

793
01:25:09,404 --> 01:25:11,770
Go go right right

794
01:25:54,649 --> 01:25:55,581
Let me see

795
01:26:00,455 --> 01:26:02,753
- You'll need a couple of stitches
- No time for that

796
01:26:02,924 --> 01:26:04,585
- There is
- They'll be here soon

797
01:26:04,659 --> 01:26:06,524
There's still time for
the colonel to come

798
01:26:10,832 --> 01:26:12,163
Are there any more files?

799
01:26:12,233 --> 01:26:15,100
There are three
brown covers on the table

800
01:26:15,203 --> 01:26:18,639
The memory cards also
have to be destroyed Sir

801
01:26:18,940 --> 01:26:20,931
Sir? Isn't he your uncle?

802
01:26:22,043 --> 01:26:24,102
Everyone has a double role here, happy?

803
01:26:24,679 --> 01:26:29,514
Get the small box in
your closet underyour bras

804
01:26:29,784 --> 01:26:31,149
How do you know
where I keep my bras?

805
01:26:31,252 --> 01:26:33,186
- Hurry
- Hey, Ashmita!

806
01:26:34,923 --> 01:26:35,947
Hurry up

807
01:26:37,759 --> 01:26:39,954
- I have to stitch him up
- What? Stitch?

808
01:26:41,262 --> 01:26:44,595
- In your closet, under your bras...
- I already told her

809
01:26:44,766 --> 01:26:46,791
- Oh so you know, go
- Ok, are you a doctor?

810
01:26:46,935 --> 01:26:49,199
You're the doctor, right?
Want to do it?

811
01:26:49,270 --> 01:26:53,104
- I'm not a medical doctor
- Ya ya she is just a nuclear oncologist

812
01:26:59,547 --> 01:27:00,912
Something is burning!

813
01:27:02,884 --> 01:27:04,715
- Asmita
- Yes sir

814
01:27:04,819 --> 01:27:06,047
We leave in 10 mins

815
01:27:06,287 --> 01:27:08,778
Sir please got to stitch him up

816
01:27:10,625 --> 01:27:13,287
Niru, pass me
the hard drive, there there...

817
01:27:14,162 --> 01:27:16,926
Just through it, and that box

818
01:27:18,233 --> 01:27:19,257
It's mustard

819
01:27:25,607 --> 01:27:27,700
I must get needle and
thread to stitch Wiz up

820
01:27:28,276 --> 01:27:30,801
You'll find them in
your lingerie drawer

821
01:27:55,370 --> 01:27:56,530
Do you wanna...

822
01:28:00,008 --> 01:28:01,805
- Are you sure!
- Go go

823
01:28:23,264 --> 01:28:26,927
- Nirupama, what you doing?
- Packing

824
01:28:27,101 --> 01:28:27,897
What?

825
01:28:29,971 --> 01:28:30,903
Tell her...

826
01:28:31,906 --> 01:28:32,998
We don't need that

827
01:28:33,775 --> 01:28:34,901
But I need all this

828
01:28:35,043 --> 01:28:38,809
- And that's an order
- Ok sir

829
01:28:56,831 --> 01:29:00,767
I'm off to the antique shop
and Jag, you to the Embassy

830
01:29:01,803 --> 01:29:04,135
- Please don't get shot any of you
- Thanks

831
01:29:04,772 --> 01:29:06,296
- Ashmita
- Ya, I'm ready

832
01:29:06,407 --> 01:29:08,204
Sir are you done, let's go

833
01:29:39,941 --> 01:29:41,875
- Good Morning
- Sir i can't have you here

834
01:29:41,976 --> 01:29:42,840
Why, what's happening?

835
01:29:42,944 --> 01:29:44,809
Look its none of your business...
I need you to clear out of here

836
01:29:44,879 --> 01:29:46,369
- Of course
- I need you to the right

837
01:30:10,772 --> 01:30:11,830
In my house?

838
01:30:12,440 --> 01:30:14,908
- We have a basement
- Yes

839
01:30:32,860 --> 01:30:36,091
Wisam, can't let the FBI get us
Take me to the Embassy

840
01:30:36,164 --> 01:30:37,028
Alright, Sir

841
01:31:03,558 --> 01:31:04,991
He rolled off the hood!

842
01:31:05,460 --> 01:31:07,451
Why are we running away
from the cops?

843
01:31:07,562 --> 01:31:09,029
You're a good man, right?

844
01:31:09,130 --> 01:31:10,859
Good man? Says who?

845
01:31:12,500 --> 01:31:15,128
- Where are you going?
- To your office

846
01:31:15,369 --> 01:31:16,199
Why?

847
01:31:17,271 --> 01:31:20,968
To check how your office
helped Omar make the dirty bomb

848
01:31:21,042 --> 01:31:23,010
The Cesium came from your office

849
01:31:23,077 --> 01:31:26,046
Who is Omar?
My company would never...

850
01:31:26,981 --> 01:31:29,040
I don't know anything

851
01:31:29,116 --> 01:31:30,743
We know that, honey

852
01:31:30,818 --> 01:31:34,151
- Just close your eyes, relax
- Why should I do that?

853
01:31:38,359 --> 01:31:39,519
What happened?

854
01:31:39,594 --> 01:31:42,529
Open your eyes
Can't give you a running commentary

855
01:32:55,236 --> 01:32:57,431
I know where he's headed

856
01:32:58,339 --> 01:33:00,034
Inform the FBI

857
01:33:02,209 --> 01:33:06,373
They'll do ourjob for us

858
01:33:19,927 --> 01:33:22,452
Did you see them dead?

859
01:33:22,597 --> 01:33:25,225
Sure, the Americans
didn't take them away?

860
01:33:27,201 --> 01:33:32,571
There was nothing to take away
I prayed over their ashes

861
01:33:33,908 --> 01:33:35,307
Salim, leave us alone

862
01:33:40,348 --> 01:33:43,078
Wisam! Wait

863
01:33:50,558 --> 01:33:52,617
My warriors shouldn't
see me like this

864
01:33:56,130 --> 01:33:57,222
Why is Allah

865
01:33:58,432 --> 01:34:00,024
Making me suffer like this?

866
01:34:02,103 --> 01:34:03,468
Salim, go!

867
01:34:10,277 --> 01:34:16,580
I should've sent Jalal to
London to study Engineering

868
01:34:19,053 --> 01:34:23,956
If we had sent Nasser along,
he would've become a doctor

869
01:34:25,559 --> 01:34:27,049
Not ash

870
01:34:30,431 --> 01:34:31,989
Why?

871
01:34:32,099 --> 01:34:33,031
Why?

872
01:34:34,101 --> 01:34:37,696
Am I not a Jihadi fighting for Allah?

873
01:34:39,006 --> 01:34:40,166
Why?

874
01:34:41,208 --> 01:34:42,300
Why?

875
01:34:44,645 --> 01:34:49,014
Brother Omar, the answer
lies within your question

876
01:34:50,685 --> 01:34:52,175
Death is a part of war

877
01:34:55,289 --> 01:34:57,689
Jihadis like us don't shed tears

878
01:34:59,393 --> 01:35:00,553
Only blood

879
01:35:06,233 --> 01:35:07,757
Sheik!

880
01:35:09,637 --> 01:35:10,968
Sheik!

881
01:35:14,275 --> 01:35:15,105
Leave me

882
01:35:37,665 --> 01:35:39,223
What's going on here?

883
01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:41,630
Tawfeeq says this Pakistani is a thief

884
01:35:41,769 --> 01:35:44,135
The Pakistani says
Tawfeeq is an American spy

885
01:35:44,238 --> 01:35:45,535
What?

886
01:35:45,639 --> 01:35:47,231
The Pakistani has
already been thrashed before

887
01:35:47,308 --> 01:35:49,674
He wants revenge!
Where's the proof?

888
01:35:49,777 --> 01:35:51,745
He says the proof
is in Tawfeeq's bag

889
01:35:53,280 --> 01:35:54,577
Check it yourself

890
01:35:56,550 --> 01:35:57,676
Check it

891
01:36:03,357 --> 01:36:04,756
There's only opium in here

892
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:11,494
He sells it for us

893
01:36:11,599 --> 01:36:15,035
Tawfeeq, you're a good man

894
01:36:49,303 --> 01:36:51,203
Omar, what is this?

895
01:36:51,839 --> 01:36:53,864
You know what it is

896
01:36:54,508 --> 01:36:56,567
No, what is it?

897
01:37:05,719 --> 01:37:07,277
I really don't know

898
01:37:16,831 --> 01:37:19,493
Salim, what's this?

899
01:37:20,568 --> 01:37:23,901
A hi-tech locator,
made in the USA

900
01:37:24,772 --> 01:37:27,764
The Americans used this
signal to find our location

901
01:37:29,577 --> 01:37:30,601
Hold this

902
01:38:01,976 --> 01:38:08,176
My gratitude to Allah, Lord of all

903
01:38:08,549 --> 01:38:13,953
May he bless and protect all
his families and followers

904
01:38:16,557 --> 01:38:18,252
Save my son!

905
01:38:18,325 --> 01:38:22,659
We are carrying out Allah's
punishment of this guilty man

906
01:38:22,763 --> 01:38:24,628
I'm not guilty

907
01:38:24,965 --> 01:38:26,865
I'm not guilty!

908
01:38:29,436 --> 01:38:31,233
Yes... yes

909
01:38:31,505 --> 01:38:32,563
Tawfeeq!

910
01:38:32,806 --> 01:38:35,934
Save my son!

911
01:38:41,615 --> 01:38:42,809
Allah is great

912
01:38:42,917 --> 01:38:44,248
Praise be to Allah

913
01:38:45,252 --> 01:38:53,557
This is due to your own deeds
Allah is never unjust to His followers

914
01:38:56,230 --> 01:39:01,930
The ill you intended for
others has befallen you

915
01:39:22,623 --> 01:39:25,649
Let him go
He is innocent

916
01:39:38,572 --> 01:39:39,732
Go away

917
01:40:08,302 --> 01:40:11,931
In the name of Allah
and with His will

918
01:40:12,973 --> 01:40:17,842
Praise be to Allah

919
01:40:29,990 --> 01:40:32,823
Wisam! Hey, Kashmiri!

920
01:40:33,027 --> 01:40:34,858
Look at them

921
01:40:35,696 --> 01:40:39,928
What have they done
to your brother?

922
01:40:53,914 --> 01:40:58,681
Ok, alright you are set,
have a good day sir

923
01:40:59,386 --> 01:41:01,354
Sir, excuse me sir

924
01:41:07,161 --> 01:41:11,791
What ever happened
Wisam was one of us?

925
01:41:11,932 --> 01:41:14,901
No... no

926
01:41:16,503 --> 01:41:18,835
He is the enemy

927
01:41:19,873 --> 01:41:22,899
He turned my family to ashes

928
01:41:47,935 --> 01:41:52,804
You don't know the full story
That's why you trust him

929
01:41:52,973 --> 01:41:58,411
Abu, clear the apartment
Leave no trail

930
01:42:02,416 --> 01:42:04,884
This is urgent
Let's clearthe apartment now

931
01:42:56,803 --> 01:43:00,500
This project was in
planning for at least three years

932
01:43:00,707 --> 01:43:04,473
Your oncology machines are used
to treat cancer patients, right?

933
01:43:04,645 --> 01:43:08,137
When your international
customers sent you their machines...

934
01:43:08,215 --> 01:43:10,206
...for repairs or replacement

935
01:43:10,284 --> 01:43:11,581
- Make a left
- I know

936
01:43:11,818 --> 01:43:17,188
Omar's men would first scrape
the Cesium from those machines...

937
01:43:17,257 --> 01:43:19,191
...and only then send them to you

938
01:43:19,760 --> 01:43:20,624
Get it?

939
01:43:20,894 --> 01:43:22,521
Like Aladdin and his magic lamp!

940
01:43:22,896 --> 01:43:24,727
Exchange old lamps for new ones...

941
01:43:25,132 --> 01:43:26,190
...and the genie is in Omar's hands

942
01:43:26,300 --> 01:43:30,100
No way! Cesium can't be
scraped off by hand like that

943
01:43:30,237 --> 01:43:31,727
Do you know what will
happen if radioactive material

944
01:43:31,805 --> 01:43:35,002
Isn't handled under
proper lab conditions?

945
01:43:35,075 --> 01:43:35,871
What?

946
01:43:37,844 --> 01:43:39,709
Radiation exposure

947
01:43:41,915 --> 01:43:43,041
In Tamil

948
01:43:43,183 --> 01:43:44,241
Radiation exposure

949
01:43:46,286 --> 01:43:48,083
What? What's your problem?

950
01:43:48,689 --> 01:43:51,214
Nothing at all, madam
Just clearing my throat

951
01:43:51,558 --> 01:43:52,252
Please continue

952
01:43:54,561 --> 01:43:56,688
- Where was I?
- Cesium

953
01:43:56,930 --> 01:44:01,299
If you handle Cesium
without gloves or masks,

954
01:44:01,602 --> 01:44:05,231
...the handler will die slowly,
in six or seven months,

955
01:44:05,339 --> 01:44:06,533
...as if from cancer

956
01:44:06,607 --> 01:44:08,006
Actually, it is cancer in a way

957
01:44:08,242 --> 01:44:09,072
Correct

958
01:44:09,643 --> 01:44:11,838
Remember when they
held us in the warehouse?

959
01:44:11,912 --> 01:44:14,278
They had those cargo containers,
like a hospital ward,

960
01:44:14,548 --> 01:44:16,140
...with men lying in them?

961
01:44:16,917 --> 01:44:17,713
Oh, no!

962
01:44:17,918 --> 01:44:20,853
They handled Cesium
with their bare hands?

963
01:44:21,021 --> 01:44:21,851
But why?

964
01:44:22,623 --> 01:44:24,682
Jihadis
They know no fear

965
01:44:27,327 --> 01:44:31,525
Unlike otherJihadis who
die at the push of a button

966
01:44:32,633 --> 01:44:34,294
These are suicide bombers...

967
01:44:34,768 --> 01:44:36,099
In slow motion

968
01:44:37,604 --> 01:44:41,734
They are prepared to die
slowly to kill their enemies

969
01:44:41,842 --> 01:44:44,310
And their leader is my comrade,
Omar Qureshi

970
01:44:44,578 --> 01:44:45,545
Who is Omar?

971
01:44:46,046 --> 01:44:48,071
The one who tried to
overtake us in the car

972
01:44:48,582 --> 01:44:49,810
The man with the...

973
01:44:49,916 --> 01:44:52,783
He became like that
thanks to the Cesium

974
01:44:52,886 --> 01:44:55,252
God save us

975
01:44:56,123 --> 01:44:57,021
Which God?

976
01:44:57,291 --> 01:44:59,759
- Now, look here...
- We'll discuss that later

977
01:44:59,826 --> 01:45:05,662
I want a detailed list of Deepak's
customers, accounts and addresses

978
01:45:05,766 --> 01:45:06,824
But why?

979
01:45:07,401 --> 01:45:10,893
Why should we do this?
This is the police's job

980
01:45:11,004 --> 01:45:12,699
It's more complicated

981
01:45:12,806 --> 01:45:16,139
Besides, this is
beyond NYPDjurisdiction

982
01:45:16,276 --> 01:45:18,107
But within yours?

983
01:45:19,079 --> 01:45:21,707
It's no time to argue
You saw what happened, right?

984
01:45:21,815 --> 01:45:24,113
Right! You killed a lot of them

985
01:45:25,385 --> 01:45:27,649
You rescued me
Thank you forthat

986
01:45:28,221 --> 01:45:29,950
But this is wrong

987
01:45:32,392 --> 01:45:34,121
You need a code
to open the safe

988
01:45:34,194 --> 01:45:36,389
We know that, honey

989
01:45:36,663 --> 01:45:38,221
We bugged your entire office

990
01:45:38,732 --> 01:45:40,700
You bugged our office?

991
01:45:43,737 --> 01:45:45,728
Oh god see this is what I'm saying

992
01:45:45,806 --> 01:45:47,000
I don't know who you are

993
01:45:47,074 --> 01:45:47,938
Who are you?

994
01:45:48,675 --> 01:45:50,233
Are you good or evil?

995
01:45:53,113 --> 01:45:56,378
Why didn't you ask
this man that question?

996
01:45:56,983 --> 01:45:59,042
- He's dead
- So what?

997
01:45:59,353 --> 01:46:00,877
Does death wash away sins?

998
01:46:01,321 --> 01:46:03,812
So come on,
Let's then forgive Hitler!

999
01:46:05,792 --> 01:46:09,193
This money is blood soaked
The blood of innocents

1000
01:46:10,063 --> 01:46:13,692
I've done a lot of
good and bad in my life

1001
01:46:15,936 --> 01:46:19,235
Some of my sins cannot
be erased even by death

1002
01:46:20,807 --> 01:46:22,104
To answeryour question

1003
01:46:22,743 --> 01:46:24,074
I'm a mix of both

1004
01:46:25,212 --> 01:46:29,342
I'm hero and a villain,
I'm good and I'm bad

1005
01:46:49,870 --> 01:46:51,303
What's that noise?

1006
01:46:54,875 --> 01:46:57,241
Let's go
Let's go!

1007
01:46:58,412 --> 01:47:01,813
Wisam get out of there,
now now now

1008
01:47:22,903 --> 01:47:24,097
What's this?

1009
01:47:25,305 --> 01:47:28,900
It's a high-tech locator,
made in the USA

1010
01:47:29,075 --> 01:47:32,135
The Americans used this
signal to find our location

1011
01:47:32,212 --> 01:47:33,076
Hold this

1012
01:47:33,180 --> 01:47:34,408
You rascal!

1013
01:47:46,793 --> 01:47:48,488
Lmtiaz, what have you done?

1014
01:47:48,795 --> 01:47:51,821
I told you to get it out
of the bag and destroy it

1015
01:47:52,999 --> 01:47:54,796
Why do you disobey my orders?

1016
01:47:54,901 --> 01:47:58,462
Sir, the Pakistani saw
me opening Tawfeeq's bag

1017
01:47:58,872 --> 01:48:00,430
I was going to do it later...

1018
01:48:00,540 --> 01:48:02,906
...but he raised hell

1019
01:48:04,077 --> 01:48:04,873
I'm sorry

1020
01:48:05,912 --> 01:48:06,936
You are sorry

1021
01:48:07,347 --> 01:48:08,905
Tawfeeq will die because of us

1022
01:48:09,816 --> 01:48:12,307
- Allah will not forgive us
- Us?

1023
01:48:12,986 --> 01:48:14,078
You mean 'you'?

1024
01:48:14,888 --> 01:48:19,086
Lmtiaz is a pseudonym,
not my religion

1025
01:48:21,561 --> 01:48:25,053
Do I have your
permission to leave? Sir

1026
01:48:28,602 --> 01:48:29,296
Dismiss

1027
01:48:36,409 --> 01:48:41,904
My gratitude to Allah, Lord of all

1028
01:48:42,315 --> 01:48:45,512
May he bless and protect all
his families and followers

1029
01:48:45,819 --> 01:48:49,016
Kashmiri, save my son!

1030
01:49:19,052 --> 01:49:21,612
I have a lot of emotional baggage

1031
01:49:22,055 --> 01:49:23,852
I don't have time to discuss it now

1032
01:49:24,257 --> 01:49:27,522
We have to stop Omar and his gang
Their accounts are in your computer

1033
01:49:27,627 --> 01:49:28,821
So please help me

1034
01:49:28,929 --> 01:49:30,021
You need the password

1035
01:49:30,130 --> 01:49:31,597
- The password is moolah
- Moolah

1036
01:49:32,599 --> 01:49:37,468
- Yeah its moolah,
- Yeah moolah, but?

1037
01:49:45,312 --> 01:49:47,371
Abbasi your service is needed today

1038
01:49:48,148 --> 01:49:49,581
I thought we have more time

1039
01:49:50,483 --> 01:49:52,110
Why you have problem?

1040
01:49:52,185 --> 01:49:53,618
No no
I'm ready

1041
01:49:54,321 --> 01:49:56,846
- Allah is the greatest
- Allah is the greatest

1042
01:50:03,530 --> 01:50:08,092
Salaam aleikum, my name is Munnavar
You have a packet for me

1043
01:50:08,234 --> 01:50:10,293
You? You are Munnavar?

1044
01:50:10,437 --> 01:50:14,897
Yeah! I converted
Look I have no time

1045
01:50:14,975 --> 01:50:19,139
Call Omar or Salim
You want me to call him?

1046
01:50:19,379 --> 01:50:20,937
No... No
Come on in

1047
01:50:39,299 --> 01:50:40,357
What's that?

1048
01:50:45,138 --> 01:50:46,332
That's mogul original

1049
01:50:47,273 --> 01:50:48,604
Be with you in a moment

1050
01:50:53,380 --> 01:50:54,347
Excuse me

1051
01:50:54,447 --> 01:50:56,438
Could you tell me
where the piano rolls are?

1052
01:50:56,549 --> 01:50:58,176
Right over here on the table

1053
01:50:58,251 --> 01:50:59,149
Alright thanks

1054
01:51:17,504 --> 01:51:18,562
Here you go

1055
01:51:19,305 --> 01:51:20,101
Thanks

1056
01:51:21,608 --> 01:51:27,274
Hello I am Munnavar, I have come
forthe package, Omar has sent me

1057
01:52:15,595 --> 01:52:16,425
Hi

1058
01:52:20,800 --> 01:52:22,529
Looking for this Mr. Dawkins

1059
01:53:17,724 --> 01:53:20,693
This guy Abassi received
a large payment

1060
01:53:20,760 --> 01:53:22,660
The shipment came from India

1061
01:53:22,862 --> 01:53:25,262
There's no entry for
the source of the funds

1062
01:53:25,398 --> 01:53:27,263
Check the bank

1063
01:53:31,805 --> 01:53:33,466
The money came from Nigeria

1064
01:53:33,673 --> 01:53:36,164
We don't have
customers in Nigeria

1065
01:53:36,609 --> 01:53:37,667
May be Yemen

1066
01:53:39,179 --> 01:53:40,111
FBI

1067
01:53:40,580 --> 01:53:43,447
Ladies and Gentleman,
You are under arrest

1068
01:53:49,455 --> 01:53:51,889
If you let me make a call
to my Embassy?

1069
01:53:52,125 --> 01:53:54,719
No and if you touch your cell phone
I might have to shoot you

1070
01:53:55,562 --> 01:54:00,261
Yeah I know but if you talk to my Embassy
they will be able tell you that I am...

1071
01:54:00,333 --> 01:54:05,293
You're what? The president of India?
Look you are coming with me, so are they

1072
01:54:05,371 --> 01:54:08,670
Hey hey that's my wife
Take it easy, or else

1073
01:54:08,741 --> 01:54:10,902
Or else what?

1074
01:54:11,678 --> 01:54:13,475
Listen to me

1075
01:54:14,180 --> 01:54:15,374
Hold your fire

1076

It's alright sir

1078
01:55:59,752 --> 01:56:00,480
Right now?

1079
01:56:01,321 --> 01:56:03,016
Allah is the greatest

1080
01:56:07,694 --> 01:56:10,993
The time has come
for us to go to Heaven

1081
01:56:17,870 --> 01:56:22,603
Tom the bomb in the apartment
is a diversion it's not dirty

1082
01:56:23,343 --> 01:56:26,506
Look you can lock me up in
yourjail and throw away the keys

1083
01:56:26,579 --> 01:56:29,514
I don't care but you
have to listen to me...

1084
01:56:29,682 --> 01:56:31,240
Tell your superior...

1085
01:56:32,485 --> 01:56:36,251
Send somebody to the warehouse
You would save lot of lives

1086
01:56:41,060 --> 01:56:45,656
I'm sure you have a Muslim name
Where were you born

1087
01:56:47,300 --> 01:56:48,267
Mayavaram

1088
01:56:48,468 --> 01:56:49,435
Come again

1089
01:56:51,838 --> 01:56:55,296
You first let me go
May be I'll come again

1090
01:56:58,044 --> 01:57:00,808
You are smart hands aren't you?

1091
01:57:01,581 --> 01:57:02,343
Ya...

1092
01:57:04,350 --> 01:57:04,873
May be

1093
01:57:06,886 --> 01:57:07,853
Thank you

1094
01:57:29,442 --> 01:57:32,843
OK sister is that how
you are going to play it?

1095
01:57:33,012 --> 01:57:35,503
I am not playing
I am telling you the truth

1096
01:57:35,948 --> 01:57:37,745
Satyameva jeyate
(The truth will triumph)

1097
01:57:37,984 --> 01:57:42,318
Look, you call me names again,
I will sling your hands

1098
01:57:42,588 --> 01:57:43,316
Oh god

1099
01:57:43,389 --> 01:57:45,653
What god is that? Allah?

1100
01:57:45,758 --> 01:57:52,391
That is my husband's god
My God has four hands

1101
01:57:53,766 --> 01:57:58,999
Four hands? AGod with four hands?
How do you crucify him then?

1102
01:57:59,539 --> 01:58:01,097
We don't crucify our God

1103
01:58:01,174 --> 01:58:02,106
Then?

1104
01:58:03,142 --> 01:58:04,939
We dunk him in the sea

1105
01:58:35,475 --> 01:58:37,773
Wait... I lost it

1106
01:58:42,782 --> 01:58:47,014
Ok you Son of a Gun, I getting
calls about radiation all over New York

1107
01:58:47,153 --> 01:58:49,178
So what, so what it's a dirty bomb

1108
01:58:49,956 --> 01:58:53,414
So if I'm gonna die, I am gonna
make sure that I kill you first

1109
01:58:56,662 --> 01:58:59,597
What? Want you wanna
me to do with this guy?

1110
01:59:00,967 --> 01:59:03,458
These are pigeons
released by Omar

1111
01:59:04,203 --> 01:59:05,067
What?

1112
01:59:06,873 --> 01:59:11,469
Look! Look for
the Pigeons of New York

1113
01:59:11,844 --> 01:59:17,749
The radiation is a diversion
The dirty bomb is yet to blow

1114
01:59:17,817 --> 01:59:19,944
I don't know what
the hell you are talking about

1115
01:59:20,019 --> 01:59:22,613
You will
If you listen to me

1116
01:59:49,215 --> 01:59:54,551
Ok wise guy how did you
know about the pigeons?

1117
01:59:56,822 --> 01:59:58,949
Many years ago
we spoke about it

1118
01:59:59,692 --> 02:00:00,784
We... who?

1119
02:00:02,995 --> 02:00:04,155
Omar and I

1120
02:00:04,764 --> 02:00:06,629
Don't mess with me

1121
02:00:10,102 --> 02:00:15,631
What if we detonated
a nuclear device in New York City?

1122
02:00:20,213 --> 02:00:22,181
How do we take
a nuclear device there?

1123
02:00:23,683 --> 02:00:24,843
I have a plan

1124
02:00:27,286 --> 02:00:29,720
We'll need many Jihadis

1125
02:00:31,057 --> 02:00:32,547
Won't you ask me how?

1126
02:00:35,661 --> 02:00:36,286
How?

1127
02:00:37,096 --> 02:00:43,899
We'll tie tiny capsules of Cesium
or Plutonium to the legs of pigeons

1128
02:00:46,172 --> 02:00:50,233
To the pigeons of New York City

1129
02:00:50,743 --> 02:00:56,648
The radiation detecting
Geiger counters will go crazy

1130
02:00:59,318 --> 02:01:04,221
They will feel stupid for
mistaking pigeons for Jihadi bombs

1131
02:01:04,824 --> 02:01:07,315
And when they relax...

1132
02:01:31,917 --> 02:01:37,617
Tom, this is Mr. Singh
from the Indian Embassy

1133
02:01:39,592 --> 02:01:42,561
- You wanna help Mr. Kashmiri up here
- Yes of course

1134
02:01:43,229 --> 02:01:48,223
He is a spook like us
Research and Analysis Wing, India

1135
02:01:48,734 --> 02:01:53,137
Oh! Look... looks like
that I owe you an apology

1136
02:01:53,406 --> 02:01:55,237
There is no need for that Tom

1137
02:01:57,977 --> 02:01:59,274
He understands

1138
02:01:59,745 --> 02:02:04,910
These things happens,
it's not personal just business

1139
02:02:06,152 --> 02:02:07,915
No time for thank you or sorry

1140
02:02:09,655 --> 02:02:11,020
There's work to do, Wisam

1141
02:02:14,427 --> 02:02:17,396
Hello Mr. Wisam the nation
is proud of you...

1142
02:02:17,630 --> 02:02:20,724
...and your bravery in exposing
the Al-Qaeda sleeper cell

1143
02:02:20,833 --> 02:02:25,031
The department of homeland
security has also expressed its gratitude

1144
02:02:25,171 --> 02:02:27,332
Hillary called me to thank India

1145
02:02:27,406 --> 02:02:29,704
Wisam you are alright I guess

1146
02:02:29,775 --> 02:02:31,709
Yes sir I am fine
Thank you

1147
02:02:32,211 --> 02:02:36,011
Take your brief from Col Jagannath
and Mr Gurnihal singh

1148
02:02:37,216 --> 02:02:38,843
They will tell you what to do...

1149
02:02:39,452 --> 02:02:44,321
...and the ambassador will keep me informed
I am sure you understand Major

1150
02:02:45,057 --> 02:02:47,719
Will do sir
I will take the brief from them

1151
02:02:47,827 --> 02:02:48,691
Thank you sir

1152
02:02:48,761 --> 02:02:50,285
- Hail India
- Hail India

1153
02:02:51,130 --> 02:02:53,724
Jesus man! Who the hell are you?

1154
02:02:57,036 --> 02:02:58,936
Have you spoken to Dawkins, sir?

1155
02:02:59,472 --> 02:03:04,239
- I thought he was with you
- No, I thought he was with you!

1156
02:03:05,378 --> 02:03:08,176
The last he called he said
he sent the tape to the Embassy

1157
02:03:08,280 --> 02:03:10,111
Yes, we got the tapes

1158
02:03:10,916 --> 02:03:13,749
Where is Dawkins then?

1159
02:03:14,086 --> 02:03:18,921
Wisam, is the warehouse around here?

1160
02:03:19,191 --> 02:03:27,121
No no no... lt's... it's
somewhere around here, I think

1161
02:03:30,403 --> 02:03:34,032
Damn it! There is a school nearby

1162
02:04:59,091 --> 02:05:01,150
Freeze, this is the FBI

1163
02:05:05,364 --> 02:05:06,797
I said freeze

1164
02:05:26,085 --> 02:05:30,283
Hello! Wisam here sir

1165
02:05:38,597 --> 02:05:40,155
Hello Wisam!

1166
02:05:40,266 --> 02:05:41,290
Trouble sir?

1167
02:05:41,967 --> 02:05:43,264
Absolutely...

1168
02:05:43,469 --> 02:05:45,164
Think it could turn sticky

1169
02:05:45,604 --> 02:05:48,573
Seems like it Wiz
Just a moment

1170
02:05:51,944 --> 02:05:59,077
If Ml6 and RAW try to blow us up,
we can do better, bigger!

1171
02:05:59,618 --> 02:06:01,813
Any last words to your handler

1172
02:06:08,394 --> 02:06:10,954
I just got a traced
call from Brooklyn park

1173
02:07:54,500 --> 02:07:55,626
You alright Sir

1174
02:07:58,771 --> 02:08:00,068
What are those pills?

1175
02:08:00,739 --> 02:08:03,435
Nitroglycerin
Sublingual

1176
02:08:04,343 --> 02:08:11,249
I can't have a heart attack just
because my best friend died, right?

1177
02:08:12,217 --> 02:08:13,377
We have work to do

1178
02:08:34,807 --> 02:08:37,241
That's his apartment up there
The Nigerian

1179
02:08:37,509 --> 02:08:38,999
He got a name?

1180
02:08:39,111 --> 02:08:42,774
I am not sure... Manabi... Vasabi...
Something like that

1181
02:08:43,048 --> 02:08:45,346
...they will send a photo id from precinct

1182
02:08:51,790 --> 02:08:53,690
How can you be sure
the is the guy?

1183
02:08:53,759 --> 02:08:55,021
I'm not sure

1184
02:08:56,361 --> 02:09:00,229
His name was in the computer in
your office, and he's Nigerian

1185
02:09:00,799 --> 02:09:02,494
If it isn't him...

1186
02:09:03,469 --> 02:09:06,495
Why sorry?
He's a criminal anyway

1187
02:09:07,039 --> 02:09:09,405
Agents to Dyker heights address
I will be there in 10

1188
02:09:09,508 --> 02:09:13,410
Do not approach until the SWAT team arrives
Possible suspect sitting on a bomb

1189
02:09:13,545 --> 02:09:16,605
Brad are the nest guys here
Good, SWAT

1190
02:09:17,182 --> 02:09:18,012
Alright

1191
02:09:49,481 --> 02:09:54,418
These must be the NEST guys
I got confirmation that Abassi is up there

1192
02:09:55,454 --> 02:09:57,388
Hey Brad
What's the status?

1193
02:10:13,438 --> 02:10:17,465
Nirupama, these are the nest guys,
explain to them about the Cesium and stuff

1194
02:10:26,752 --> 02:10:28,743
Tom, can I come with you?

1195
02:10:38,130 --> 02:10:39,427
Here is your glock

1196
02:10:41,667 --> 02:10:43,601
I don't know
howthe hell you got that

1197
02:10:44,803 --> 02:10:45,735
Thanks

1198
02:10:46,371 --> 02:10:47,269
Let's go

1199
02:12:25,804 --> 02:12:28,466
Hello, welcome, your
friends' already arrived

1200
02:13:45,917 --> 02:13:48,408
- Could be a dirty bomb?
- I am not sure

1201
02:13:48,587 --> 02:13:50,521
It is, it has Cesium

1202
02:13:50,689 --> 02:13:53,715
Cesium? And what would
you know about it Mam?

1203
02:13:53,859 --> 02:13:59,058
Atomic number 55; melting point
28.5; atomic weight 132.905;

1204
02:13:59,131 --> 02:13:59,927
I am sorry

1205
02:14:00,032 --> 02:14:02,728
The Cesium came from
the company I used work for

1206
02:14:02,801 --> 02:14:03,733
And you are?

1207
02:14:03,835 --> 02:14:05,427
I am doctor Nirupama

1208
02:14:05,537 --> 02:14:08,506
She has a doctorate
in nuclear oncology

1209
02:14:08,640 --> 02:14:13,304
Oh! I am Bob
no Doctorate

1210
02:14:17,783 --> 02:14:22,914
Nirupama, take a cab or a police
car and go as far away as possible

1211
02:14:23,688 --> 02:14:25,588
I will, if you come with me

1212
02:14:26,691 --> 02:14:28,352
I have a duty here

1213
02:14:28,460 --> 02:14:29,586
So do I

1214
02:14:29,661 --> 02:14:31,629
Have you seen the phone
on top of the bomb?

1215
02:14:31,730 --> 02:14:34,756
If someone calls this phone,
the bomb will detonate

1216
02:14:34,900 --> 02:14:36,595
We need a faraday shield

1217
02:14:36,768 --> 02:14:38,099
Which shield, what's that?

1218
02:14:38,170 --> 02:14:43,107
Hey! Your wife is a Techie and probably knows
a little more about the bomb than you do

1219
02:14:43,408 --> 02:14:47,811
- Oh Shut up & thank you Bob
- You are welcome

1220
02:15:19,111 --> 02:15:20,442
What's he doing?

1221
02:15:26,518 --> 02:15:27,883
He is praying for you

1222
02:15:28,420 --> 02:15:29,717
God almighty

1223
02:15:30,689 --> 02:15:33,783
Basically, except
that's the Arabic version

1224
02:16:06,024 --> 02:16:08,424
I need to call
Can I do it inside or outside?

1225
02:16:28,914 --> 02:16:31,109
Can I get you anything
to drink before we take off?

1226
02:16:31,516 --> 02:16:33,040
- Anything foryou sir?
- No

1227
02:16:50,635 --> 02:16:52,159
Target down...

1228
02:16:55,974 --> 02:16:57,908
Yeah that's a cell phone trigger

1229
02:17:02,714 --> 02:17:03,646
Get her

1230
02:17:49,594 --> 02:17:52,324
- We got him
- Well done guys

1231
02:17:52,998 --> 02:17:54,260
Get Bob up here

1232
02:18:09,581 --> 02:18:11,071
Hey, you can't go in there

1233
02:18:11,149 --> 02:18:13,879
Hey hey she is with us

1234
02:18:14,853 --> 02:18:18,220
- Wait! Where are you going?
- He is my husband!!

1235
02:18:20,292 --> 02:18:23,318
What's that?
Yeah yeah send her up

1236
02:18:24,829 --> 02:18:26,160
Thank God! It's over

1237
02:18:26,231 --> 02:18:30,065
No it's not,
it's not over

1238
02:18:34,406 --> 02:18:36,840
Faraday... we need a Faraday shield

1239
02:18:36,941 --> 02:18:38,067
It will be here in 5

1240
02:18:38,143 --> 02:18:39,269
That's too late

1241
02:18:39,411 --> 02:18:43,040
Someone could have heard our
gunshots and might trigger the bomb

1242
02:18:44,249 --> 02:18:47,343
It might be too late,
we need a Faraday shield...

1243
02:19:05,270 --> 02:19:07,295
Open its door

1244
02:19:08,973 --> 02:19:10,099
Careful

1245
02:19:14,679 --> 02:19:20,345
Wow... maybe, maybe not

1246
02:19:21,853 --> 02:19:25,016
Eitheryou are genius
or we are all dead

1247
02:19:32,931 --> 02:19:35,024

1249
02:19:50,281 --> 02:19:51,339
Ok genius

1250
02:19:54,185 --> 02:19:56,278
That's enough
Go now

1251
02:19:59,491 --> 02:20:00,321
No

1252
02:20:01,459 --> 02:20:04,860
I'm staying with you,
If you don't mind

1253
02:20:04,963 --> 02:20:05,793
I do

1254
02:20:06,865 --> 02:20:08,662
- Suppose it doesn't...
- It will work!

1255
02:20:10,268 --> 02:20:11,292
Well I don't know

1256
02:20:12,270 --> 02:20:15,706
If anything happens,
whatever happens...

1257
02:20:18,276 --> 02:20:23,942
I want you to know
that I am sorry

1258
02:20:27,018 --> 02:20:31,387
If we come out of this alive,
I'll tell you in detail

1259
02:21:18,136 --> 02:21:20,536
Abassi, detonate now

1260
02:21:21,306 --> 02:21:25,106
Peace and blessings upon you
Brother Omar, Abassi is dead

1261
02:21:26,244 --> 02:21:28,041
How can I be at service to you?

1262
02:21:29,948 --> 02:21:31,006
This is Wisam

1263
02:21:48,533 --> 02:21:50,558
Thank God!
It's over

1264
02:21:50,869 --> 02:21:52,461
No, it's not over

1265
02:21:52,837 --> 02:21:55,362
Either Omar dies,
or I die

1266
02:21:55,607 --> 02:21:57,939
Until then, the story continues

1267
02:22:01,546 --> 02:22:04,947
What did you think about him?
After seeing what you laughed?

1268
02:22:05,049 --> 02:22:10,453
While a seed sprout
A full form will come out

1269
02:22:15,960 --> 02:22:19,555
He is born for fire
He grew up with eternity

1270
02:22:19,831 --> 02:22:24,495
On a right time,
his own form will come out

1271
02:22:29,641 --> 02:22:31,541
He's our only live agent

1272
02:22:34,045 --> 02:22:37,503
Like small, small particles
he'll reside under earth

1273
02:22:37,615 --> 02:22:42,279
While digging the earth
the different faces will come out

1274
02:22:42,353 --> 02:22:44,321
Wisam was a loyal Indian

1275
02:22:44,422 --> 02:22:47,186
He is one, and will always be

1276
02:22:49,093 --> 02:22:52,426
Which face he'll take?
Who'll know that?

1277
02:22:52,530 --> 02:22:57,524
He'll take forms alternately
from different faces

1278
02:23:03,541 --> 02:23:10,105
Do you understand who he is?
You can see him as fire

1279
02:23:10,949 --> 02:23:17,513
He created history by breaking obstacles
Can you remember?

1280
02:23:18,222 --> 02:23:21,248
He is not a slave for anyone

1281
02:23:21,359 --> 02:23:23,657
Let them go, Nasser sir

1282
02:23:23,928 --> 02:23:25,589
These are children of the land

1283
02:23:25,697 --> 02:23:32,125
He passes forest
without disturbing its serenity

1284
02:24:35,667 --> 02:24:39,398
What did you think about him?
After seeing what you laughed?

1285
02:24:39,504 --> 02:24:47,502
While a seed sprout
A full form will come out

1286
02:24:50,548 --> 02:24:54,211
He is born for fire
He grew up with eternity

1287
02:24:54,318 --> 02:25:00,621
On a right time,
his own form will come out

1288
02:25:05,263 --> 02:25:12,032
Do you understand who he is?
You can see him as fire

1289
02:25:12,704 --> 02:25:19,439
He created history by breaking obstacles
Can you remember?

1290
02:25:20,078 --> 02:25:26,540
He is not a slave for anyone
He is not a king for anyone

1291
02:25:27,585 --> 02:25:33,581
He passes forest
without disturbing its serenity

1292
02:25:34,726 --> 02:25:38,594
What did you think about him?
After seeing what you laughed?

1293
02:25:38,696 --> 02:25:44,657
While a seed sprout
A full form will come out

1294
02:25:49,373 --> 02:25:53,332
He is born for fire
He grew up with eternity

1295
02:25:53,444 --> 02:25:59,405
On a right time,
his own form will come out

1296
02:26:03,821 --> 02:26:10,659
Multiple forms
with different faces (Like God Krishna)

1297
02:26:34,152 --> 02:26:37,713
Like small, small particles
he'll reside under earth

1298
02:26:37,789 --> 02:26:43,728
While digging the earth
the different faces will come out

1299
02:26:48,766 --> 02:26:52,327
Which face he'll take?
Who'll know that?

1300
02:26:52,436 --> 02:26:57,601
He'll take forms alternately
from different faces

1301
02:27:03,514 --> 02:27:09,783
Do you understand who he is?
You can see him as fire

1302
02:27:10,822 --> 02:27:17,625
He created history by breaking obstacles
Can you remember?

1303
02:27:18,329 --> 02:27:25,098
He is not a slave for anyone
He is not a king for anyone

1304
02:27:25,736 --> 02:27:31,800
He passes forest
without disturbing its serenity

1305
02:27:31,943 --> 02:27:38,781
Face, face face, faces...
form with different faces
