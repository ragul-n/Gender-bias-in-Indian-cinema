00:01:39,375 --> 00:01:40,662
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

2
00:01:47,242 --> 00:01:48,501
- Sir!
- Yes.

3
00:01:49,777 --> 00:01:51,523
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning, Rajiv. Where is Ma'am?

4
00:01:51,603 --> 00:01:53,358
- Ma'am is waiting for you.
- Thank you.

5
00:01:57,404 --> 00:01:58,476
Good morning, ma'am.

6
00:01:59,992 --> 00:02:01,554
Good morning, Mr D'costa.

7
00:02:02,348 --> 00:02:03,162
- Come.
- Thank you, ma'am.

8
00:02:03,242 --> 00:02:04,732
- Serve tea to sir too.
- Yes, Ma'am.

9
00:02:06,087 --> 00:02:07,446
Thank you, again..

10
00:02:07,844 --> 00:02:10,416
..to give an appointment
at such a short notice.

11
00:02:10,748 --> 00:02:12,835
I know you wouldn't have
asked for an urgent..

12
00:02:12,915 --> 00:02:15,596
..appointment if it was not
too important. Tell me.

13
00:02:17,075 --> 00:02:20,997
Ma'am, as per latest
intelligence report,

14
00:02:22,173 --> 00:02:24,342
Hizbul Al-Qaida has planned
terrorist attacks..

15
00:02:24,422 --> 00:02:27,901
..and targeting many of
our important cities.

16
00:02:28,744 --> 00:02:32,061
RAW had captured their chief
Yakub Habibi two months back.

17
00:02:33,197 --> 00:02:36,816
Everyone, please calm down.

18
00:02:36,896 --> 00:02:39,649
You can understand how
serious the situation is.

19
00:02:39,729 --> 00:02:41,566
The public has lost it's patience.

20
00:02:41,646 --> 00:02:42,863
We had informed you..

21
00:02:42,943 --> 00:02:44,691
..that today morning the police received
an information from secret source..

22
00:02:44,771 --> 00:02:46,360
..and had surrounded Yakub Habibi..

23
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,558
..the leader of Hizbul Al-Qaida
and other terrorists

24
00:02:49,638 --> 00:02:51,891
..in a house adjacent to the airport.

25
00:02:51,971 --> 00:02:53,650
They managed to escape from there..

26
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:56,041
..andentered a famous school
in Kolkata.

27
00:03:04,736 --> 00:03:07,307
Though most of the students
have been evacuated from there..

28
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:08,928
..but as per the information that
we got from a reliable source..

29
00:03:09,008 --> 00:03:11,539
..a rehearsal of a skit was going
on in the school's auditorium.

30
00:03:11,619 --> 00:03:13,272
The terrorist have
captivated the students..

31
00:03:13,352 --> 00:03:15,403
..along with their
teachers over there.

32
00:03:15,483 --> 00:03:17,393
Keeping in mind
the safety of the students..

33
00:03:17,473 --> 00:03:21,302
..the police are not being able
to risk going closer to the school.

34
00:03:21,382 --> 00:03:23,307
- The terrorist group, Hizbul Al-Qaida..
- Please, please..

35
00:03:23,387 --> 00:03:25,904
..has taken the responsibility of the
entire incidence and has said that..

36
00:03:25,984 --> 00:03:27,938
..if arrangements are not
made for them to leave..

37
00:03:28,018 --> 00:03:30,297
..this country without any harm
by 5 in the evening..

38
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:33,228
..then there'll be a risk to the lives
of all those who are trapped inside.

39
00:03:33,896 --> 00:03:35,856
The only question is, what
will the government do?

40
00:03:35,936 --> 00:03:37,167
Will they consider
the safety of the children..

41
00:03:37,247 --> 00:03:38,509
..and accept the demands
of the terrorists?

42
00:03:38,589 --> 00:03:40,557
Or will they risk the lives
of the innocent children..

43
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:42,245
..and continue to fight
against the terrorists?

44
00:03:42,325 --> 00:03:44,697
[indistinct crowd voice]

45
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:47,647
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

46
00:03:48,229 --> 00:03:50,116
- Good morning, sir.
- Morning.

47
00:04:09,224 --> 00:04:11,029
- Spider.
- Sir.

48
00:04:13,963 --> 00:04:15,152
Get ready,
we need to leave right away.

49
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:16,139
Okay, sir.

50
00:04:19,108 --> 00:04:20,749
- Oh God!
- What happened?

51
00:04:21,621 --> 00:04:23,457
The signs are not good, sir.

52
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:27,069
No, sir.
Don't ask me to go right away.

53
00:04:27,149 --> 00:04:29,250
I mean, if I leave now
then my life will be..

54
00:04:30,789 --> 00:04:33,845
Spider, don't forget,
we work for the RAW.

55
00:04:34,701 --> 00:04:38,061
You have to leave for Kolkata
immediately as Panther needs you.

56
00:04:39,848 --> 00:04:41,063
- What happened?
- Pan..

57
00:04:41,143 --> 00:04:43,466
Panther sir,
please try to understand..

58
00:04:43,546 --> 00:04:45,742
No sir, he is crazy.

59
00:04:45,822 --> 00:04:49,216
- Yes. He is crazy.
- Yes.

60
00:04:49,296 --> 00:04:52,033
He is crazy for this country.

61
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:56,210
India is his life.

62
00:05:27,145 --> 00:05:32,743
[indistinct crowd voice]

63
00:05:56,482 --> 00:05:57,861
What happened?

64
00:05:58,231 --> 00:05:59,971
Why did you stop here?

65
00:06:05,509 --> 00:06:06,756
What?

66
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:14,352
Who?

67
00:06:16,435 --> 00:06:17,441
What indecency is this?

68
00:06:17,521 --> 00:06:18,790
Made me get down from one car
in the middle of the road..

69
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:20,366
- ..and now you are asking me
to get into another.. - Sorry sir.

70
00:06:20,446 --> 00:06:21,409
Sorry about what?

71
00:06:21,489 --> 00:06:23,206
Please come, sir. Please.

72
00:06:36,482 --> 00:06:39,289
Sir, you have received the IP address
of the school's system in your email.

73
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:45,565
Sir.

74
00:06:49,877 --> 00:06:53,692
We have to hack all the CCTV
of the school right now.

75
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,956
Using one IP address for all..

76
00:06:57,881 --> 00:06:59,116
What a demand!

77
00:06:59,426 --> 00:07:01,328
What else can I do
other than demanding, sir?

78
00:07:01,408 --> 00:07:03,115
After all, you are my senior cadet.

79
00:07:03,344 --> 00:07:04,361
Okay, fine.

80
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:07,170
The treatment of always
pushing sentiments..

81
00:07:07,813 --> 00:07:09,819
..I don't like it. I am doing it.

82
00:07:11,822 --> 00:07:13,816
Sir, we have very little time.

83
00:07:40,395 --> 00:07:44,855
Excellent. Immediately play all these
screen displays on Panther's screen.

84
00:07:47,477 --> 00:07:50,670
Why Panther?
What will Panther do with all this?

85
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:53,141
Try to understand, Spider. The
lives of many children are at risk.

86
00:07:53,221 --> 00:07:55,226
That's what I am saying. If
Panther goes, the risk will increase..

87
00:07:55,306 --> 00:07:56,723
Connect Panther right now.

88
00:08:13,379 --> 00:08:16,780
[indistinct crowd voice]

89
00:08:32,812 --> 00:08:35,627
Come on. Charge!

90
00:08:46,066 --> 00:08:47,661
Hello guys, this is Panther here.

91
00:08:47,741 --> 00:08:48,586
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

92
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:49,925
Is everybody ready?

93
00:08:50,005 --> 00:08:52,122
Waiting for your order, sir.
Now listen to me.

94
00:08:52,521 --> 00:08:54,568
I will alight on the roof top
and get inside the auditorium.

95
00:08:54,648 --> 00:08:57,093
I will eliminate the two rascals
present there..

96
00:08:57,173 --> 00:08:59,731
..and the team will attack after that.
Diba.

97
00:08:59,811 --> 00:09:01,739
You will get inside the auditorium and
take over the charge of the children.

98
00:09:01,819 --> 00:09:02,652
- Clear?
- Yes, sir.

99
00:09:02,732 --> 00:09:05,766
Remember,
no one will attack before I attack.

100
00:09:05,846 --> 00:09:06,771
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

101
00:09:06,851 --> 00:09:08,024
Hello, excuse me..

102
00:09:08,104 --> 00:09:10,487
Ensure that the children
are not hurt. Clear?

103
00:09:10,567 --> 00:09:11,528
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

104
00:09:11,608 --> 00:09:12,468
- Yes, sir.
- Ready, sir.

105
00:09:12,548 --> 00:09:14,420
No, sir. I want to say something.

106
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,427
- Hello, Panther! Hello!
- Yes, Spider.

107
00:09:16,507 --> 00:09:19,181
I want to know,
what am I doing here?

108
00:09:19,261 --> 00:09:21,965
Even if a single grenade
comes towards the car..

109
00:09:22,045 --> 00:09:24,510
- ..then what will happen to me?
- You will be dead.

110
00:09:25,676 --> 00:09:27,086
I will be dead!

111
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:30,730
I didn't study so much
so that I will be dead.

112
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:32,879
He simply said, I will be dead.

113
00:09:33,626 --> 00:09:35,639
How will you understand
what human relations are?

114
00:09:35,719 --> 00:09:38,761
You have no family that you will
understand family bonding.

115
00:09:45,815 --> 00:09:49,492
Spider,
a RAW agent is never an orphan.

116
00:09:51,024 --> 00:09:53,710
I have learnt to address my country
as my mother since I was a child.

117
00:09:54,108 --> 00:09:56,000
After joining RAW,
Francis sir is our father..

118
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,119
..figure and according
to the great Vivekananda..

119
00:09:58,199 --> 00:10:00,191
..every Indian
is our brother or sister.

120
00:10:01,117 --> 00:10:03,941
So no one can be
a bigger family man than us.

121
00:10:06,892 --> 00:10:08,515
- Are you ready team?
- Yes, sir.

122
00:10:08,595 --> 00:10:09,828
- If our heart beats, then..
- Jai Hind!

123
00:10:09,908 --> 00:10:11,298
- If we breathe, then..
- Jai Hind!

124
00:10:11,378 --> 00:10:13,462
- If we bleed, then..
- Jai Hind.

125
00:11:27,849 --> 00:11:28,856
Sir.

126
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:31,228
Diba, I'll take care of things over
here, you handle things over there..

127
00:11:43,687 --> 00:11:45,065
- Take care of them.
- Right, sir.

128
00:12:05,414 --> 00:12:08,199
- You go this way and you go there.
- Yes, sir.

129
00:13:12,019 --> 00:13:14,412
- Don't worry.
- Sir. Yes, sir.

130
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:17,605
All garbage clear, we can move now.

131
00:13:18,074 --> 00:13:20,396
- Right, sir.
- It's okay. Don't worry.

132
00:13:20,476 --> 00:13:24,143
- Okay, let's go. Move, move!
- Come on, let's go.

133
00:13:49,915 --> 00:13:50,866
What is your name?

134
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:53,798
I mean what do I address you as?

135
00:13:54,122 --> 00:13:55,504
- What is your name?
- Oh!

136
00:13:56,975 --> 00:13:58,592
- Zia.
- Zia?

137
00:14:00,128 --> 00:14:02,905
- Which means source of light.
- Yes.

138
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:07,529
Source of light just emits
light not darkness.

139
00:14:07,609 --> 00:14:09,646
If the hide and seek of this
light and darkness stops..

140
00:14:09,726 --> 00:14:11,456
..then we can leave from here.

141
00:14:13,163 --> 00:14:14,283
Darkness!

142
00:14:16,425 --> 00:14:18,820
The darkness no longer prevails.
You need not fear anymore.

143
00:14:19,202 --> 00:14:20,924
- Diva, take them with you.
- All right, sir.

144
00:14:21,004 --> 00:14:22,801
- Go, everyone is waiting for you.
- Yes. Thank you.

145
00:14:40,347 --> 00:14:43,200
Where are you going?

146
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,366
I will escort them out
of the premises safely.

147
00:14:45,446 --> 00:14:46,650
Come, let me escort you.

148
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:48,136
- What?
- Safely.

149
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,819
Why here?

150
00:14:59,461 --> 00:15:02,180
Hold it. Don't move.

151
00:15:04,141 --> 00:15:05,465
Don't move.

152
00:15:13,782 --> 00:15:16,114
This is why I don't want to come
to any mission along with you.

153
00:15:16,194 --> 00:15:19,257
You were sent here
to save the children.

154
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:23,235
That you did. But how can you
kill so many people?

155
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:25,990
Spider, keeping them alive
is a threat not only..

156
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:27,883
..for the 1.34 billion people
of our country..

157
00:15:27,963 --> 00:15:31,351
..but also for the lives of 7.50
billion people of the whole world.

158
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:34,597
But how can you kill them?
I have already killed him.

159
00:15:35,008 --> 00:15:39,275
Wherever I see these terrorists,
I'll kill them right there.

160
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:42,397
That means, you are saying
that they should die.

161
00:15:42,477 --> 00:15:44,008
Exactly.
I too want to say the same.

162
00:15:44,088 --> 00:15:45,341
This man is a dangerous person.

163
00:15:45,421 --> 00:15:47,129
I won't travel with him in
the same car for such a long distance.

164
00:15:47,209 --> 00:15:49,311
Shoot him and terminate
the mission right now.

165
00:15:51,629 --> 00:15:54,828
All work and no play,
makes Jack a dull boy.

166
00:15:57,146 --> 00:16:00,560
Sitting in front of the computer
all day has made you like this.

167
00:16:01,161 --> 00:16:02,454
Yakub Habibi.

168
00:16:02,534 --> 00:16:04,518
He is the chief of
Hizbul Al-Qaida's chief.

169
00:16:05,356 --> 00:16:08,540
We'll get the information of all the
future attacks if we keep him alive.

170
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:10,423
Hope you understand.

171
00:16:10,667 --> 00:16:12,732
- Yes.
- Jack.

172
00:16:17,497 --> 00:16:21,731
Yeah. Ma'am, as per Intel report..

173
00:16:22,048 --> 00:16:24,982
..Hizbul Al-Qaida
has planned all these..

174
00:16:25,062 --> 00:16:26,884
..attacks so that Yakub is released.

175
00:16:27,608 --> 00:16:31,271
The Deputy chief of Hizbul
Al-Qaida, Afzal Faridi..

176
00:16:31,567 --> 00:16:33,928
..is himself handling
the entire mission.

177
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:50,372
So what should we do now?

178
00:16:50,452 --> 00:16:53,205
I have activated all the RAW agents.

179
00:16:54,325 --> 00:16:56,514
That is definitely not sufficient.

180
00:16:57,136 --> 00:16:58,697
I need your permission.

181
00:16:59,142 --> 00:17:03,660
I want to meet Yakub
in a special cell alone.

182
00:17:06,217 --> 00:17:08,663
- But without court orders its..
- Ma'am, we don't have time.

183
00:17:08,812 --> 00:17:10,713
That's why I have come to you.

184
00:17:13,754 --> 00:17:14,724
Okay.

185
00:17:14,804 --> 00:17:17,079
I am sending the information
to the special cell.

186
00:17:17,893 --> 00:17:18,918
Thank you, ma'am.

187
00:17:28,132 --> 00:17:29,455
One more request, ma'am.

188
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:32,172
This meeting of Yakub
and me is special.

189
00:17:32,252 --> 00:17:36,177
So, I don't want to follow
any rules over there.

190
00:17:36,658 --> 00:17:40,226
Mr. D'costa, can't you come to me
with a decent request?

191
00:17:42,592 --> 00:17:43,679
Ma'am!

192
00:17:44,422 --> 00:17:46,973
RAW wasn't formed
for decent missions.

193
00:17:47,611 --> 00:17:49,650
RAW was formed to ensure
safety for the country..

194
00:17:50,107 --> 00:17:51,669
..to ensure safety for it's citizens.

195
00:17:52,551 --> 00:17:53,927
All right, Francis.

196
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,571
You may proceed the way you want to.

197
00:17:57,243 --> 00:18:01,076
But make sure,
India doesn't suffer.

198
00:18:10,542 --> 00:18:13,618
Switch off all the CCTV
cameras installed here.

199
00:18:16,568 --> 00:18:18,268
Haven't you received orders
from the ministry?

200
00:18:18,935 --> 00:18:20,895
- Yes, we have, sir.
- Then do what I say.

201
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,289
Sir.

202
00:18:43,137 --> 00:18:46,754
Greetings, Francis.

203
00:18:59,933 --> 00:19:04,089
I knew, you will come here..

204
00:19:04,815 --> 00:19:06,834
..to meet me.

205
00:19:27,378 --> 00:19:30,563
Tell me. When and where will
the blasts take place?

206
00:19:33,042 --> 00:19:34,819
What do you think?

207
00:19:36,085 --> 00:19:38,404
Will you be able to stop these blasts?

208
00:19:39,779 --> 00:19:45,038
If you don't release me then
your entire country will be destroyed.

209
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:54,780
Hit me.

210
00:19:55,351 --> 00:19:56,737
Hit me.

211
00:19:57,488 --> 00:19:59,008
Hit me more.

212
00:19:59,088 --> 00:20:04,296
Do you think, your country
will be saved if you hit me?

213
00:20:07,861 --> 00:20:10,368
Today Mumbai will be destroyed.

214
00:20:10,448 --> 00:20:14,482
Exactly, three days later
it will be Kolkata.

215
00:20:15,341 --> 00:20:17,223
And three days after that..

216
00:20:17,766 --> 00:20:19,310
..it will be Delhi.

217
00:20:32,295 --> 00:20:33,491
- Sir.
- Panther.

218
00:20:33,704 --> 00:20:36,075
Hizbul Al-Qaida has planned an
attack in Mumbai today itself.

219
00:20:36,155 --> 00:20:37,740
Sir, the agents of our
Mumbai wing are already..

220
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,765
..being posted in all
the crowded areas.

221
00:20:39,845 --> 00:20:41,811
Don't worry, sir, I am also
going out there right away.

222
00:20:41,891 --> 00:20:43,402
- Good.
- Right, sir.

223
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:57,966
Sir, City Mall's agents have noticed
some suspicious activities.

224
00:20:58,272 --> 00:21:00,090
- Rush to the City Mall right away.
- Yes, sir.

225
00:21:14,579 --> 00:21:17,323
Sir, we have arrested 2 people.
They had explosives with them.

226
00:21:17,403 --> 00:21:19,880
Interrogation is on but
they haven't said anything yet.

227
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,499
Diba, do whatever is
needed to make them talk.

228
00:21:21,579 --> 00:21:22,878
Right, sir.

229
00:21:25,058 --> 00:21:27,047
Sir, bomb squad and sniffer dogs..

230
00:21:27,127 --> 00:21:29,186
..will reach here in some time.
They are on the way.

231
00:21:29,266 --> 00:21:32,123
No need. The public
will panic unnecessarily.

232
00:21:32,203 --> 00:21:33,234
Whatever needs to be done,
are being done by my agents.

233
00:21:33,314 --> 00:21:34,244
- Come.
- Okay, sir.

234
00:21:52,066 --> 00:21:53,368
There.

235
00:22:10,197 --> 00:22:13,142
- Yeah.
- What?

236
00:22:16,494 --> 00:22:17,939
- Sir. Two bombs have been detected.
- Yes.

237
00:22:18,019 --> 00:22:19,954
There's a possibility that there
are more bombs in the mall.

238
00:22:21,402 --> 00:22:22,912
Evacuate the mall immediately.

239
00:22:22,992 --> 00:22:24,750
- And make sure that nobody
gets panicked. Okay? - Yes, sir.

240
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:25,889
- Yes, sir.
- Let's go.

241
00:22:29,337 --> 00:22:31,799
Move please. Come on, move.

242
00:22:31,879 --> 00:22:34,794
Move. Move. Come on, hurry up.

243
00:22:35,482 --> 00:22:38,590
[indistinct crowd voice]

244
00:22:55,705 --> 00:22:56,960
- Got it?
- Yes, sir.

245
00:22:58,474 --> 00:22:59,852
- Deactivate it.
- Yes, sir.

246
00:23:00,276 --> 00:23:04,220
[indistinct crowd voice]

247
00:23:14,337 --> 00:23:17,527
Sir, the entire mall has been
evacuated. There are no casualties.

248
00:23:17,607 --> 00:23:19,007
- Good.
- Sir..

249
00:23:19,087 --> 00:23:20,975
..should I ask our police force
to come out too?

250
00:23:24,926 --> 00:23:28,310
Mr. Namdev, do you know that we
all are a part of the defense force..

251
00:23:28,716 --> 00:23:30,222
..and it's our duty
to protect this country..

252
00:23:30,302 --> 00:23:32,082
..it's people, and its property?

253
00:23:32,162 --> 00:23:34,493
- But sir, if the blast..
- There will be no blast today.

254
00:23:34,815 --> 00:23:37,783
Today there won't be any blasts.
Today will be the day to diffuse..

255
00:23:38,786 --> 00:23:40,468
..not just bombs..

256
00:23:41,742 --> 00:23:45,681
..but the confidence of the terrorist
will be diffused too.

257
00:23:47,173 --> 00:23:49,219
- Right?
- Yes, sir.

258
00:24:17,013 --> 00:24:21,295
[indistinct voice]

259
00:24:38,232 --> 00:24:44,020
'I, Hizbul Al-Qaida's acting
commander, Afzal Faridi..'

260
00:24:44,564 --> 00:24:46,405
'..take complete responsibility
of all the blasts..'

261
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:48,244
'..that took place
through out Mumbai.'

262
00:24:48,893 --> 00:24:50,891
'And this is just the beginning.'

263
00:24:51,378 --> 00:24:54,758
'We want to tell
the Indian government..'

264
00:24:55,027 --> 00:24:57,612
'..that if they do not release..'

265
00:24:57,948 --> 00:25:00,943
'..our capable Jihadi Yakub Habibi..'

266
00:25:02,048 --> 00:25:05,224
'..within the next 72 hours
with all due respect..'

267
00:25:05,525 --> 00:25:09,183
'..then mark my words, we'll shake up
the foundation of India.'

268
00:25:09,263 --> 00:25:11,896
'We will cross
all the limits of terrorism.'

269
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:15,911
'We will destroy each
and every city of India.'

270
00:25:16,314 --> 00:25:21,498
'We don't fear death.'

271
00:25:21,879 --> 00:25:25,235
'Just remember,
within the next 72 hours.'

272
00:25:30,698 --> 00:25:32,896
As per the official data,
till now we have..

273
00:25:32,976 --> 00:25:34,953
..received the confirmation
that 170 people are dead.

274
00:25:36,489 --> 00:25:39,066
I wonder what will the final tally be?

275
00:25:39,513 --> 00:25:40,678
We couldn't understand..

276
00:25:40,758 --> 00:25:42,806
..that they have planned this kind
of serial blasts, ma'am.

277
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,312
I am very sorry.

278
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:50,289
You can sit before me and say
that you are sorry, Francis.

279
00:25:51,082 --> 00:25:54,107
I won't be able to say sorry
to the people of our country..

280
00:25:55,602 --> 00:25:58,030
..who have lost their near
and dear ones.

281
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:03,484
Even if you are unable
to feel their pain, I can feel it.

282
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:21,682
I understand their pain, ma'am.

283
00:26:22,386 --> 00:26:26,536
I know it as I too have lost
everything just like them.

284
00:26:26,941 --> 00:26:28,254
Everything.

285
00:26:29,727 --> 00:26:32,742
No. I cannot take any more risk.

286
00:26:33,946 --> 00:26:34,789
Yes, ma'am?

287
00:26:34,869 --> 00:26:36,485
Rajiv, connect me
to the Prime ministers office.

288
00:26:36,565 --> 00:26:38,951
Ma'am, I hope you are not
considering the release of Yakub.

289
00:26:39,031 --> 00:26:40,748
We have no other choice.

290
00:26:40,828 --> 00:26:43,501
Ma'am, please try to understand.
If Yakub is released..

291
00:26:43,581 --> 00:26:45,906
..do you understand how many more
terrorist attacks will take place?

292
00:26:45,986 --> 00:26:47,493
And if Yakub is not released..

293
00:26:47,573 --> 00:26:50,258
..then do you have any idea how many
more people will loose their lives?

294
00:26:50,338 --> 00:26:53,318
No, no. Not possible.
I can't take this risk.

295
00:26:53,398 --> 00:26:54,891
We are not prepared
for any more attacks.

296
00:26:54,971 --> 00:26:56,722
Ma'am, no more attacks will happen.

297
00:26:57,798 --> 00:26:59,242
I promise.

298
00:26:59,614 --> 00:27:03,399
Our best undercover agent,
Panther is leading this mission.

299
00:27:03,922 --> 00:27:06,619
But, Francis,
Panther is a common mortal.

300
00:27:06,699 --> 00:27:09,331
Just a mere human being.
He is not a super hero.

301
00:27:09,411 --> 00:27:13,124
Panther is not a super hero.
He is just a mere human being.

302
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:16,261
But he is not less than a super hero.

303
00:27:16,341 --> 00:27:19,276
The word failure is not
in his dictionary, ma'am.

304
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,963
And the most important thing.

305
00:27:23,611 --> 00:27:26,810
He got a vital lead
about a man named Salim.

306
00:27:32,366 --> 00:27:34,195
Maulana Salim Mirza.

307
00:27:34,275 --> 00:27:37,038
Apparently, he owns
an antique shop at chor bazaar.

308
00:27:37,927 --> 00:27:40,172
In 2002,
he went to Al Dehra for business..

309
00:27:40,252 --> 00:27:42,191
..and gets in touch
with Hizbul Al-Qaida.

310
00:27:43,013 --> 00:27:44,875
Then in 2003,
he again goes to Al Dehra..

311
00:27:44,955 --> 00:27:48,442
..with middle east visa
for five months.

312
00:27:48,522 --> 00:27:50,635
Most probably for training purpose.

313
00:27:51,864 --> 00:27:55,614
He started taking terrorism
class over here since 2005.

314
00:27:55,694 --> 00:27:57,284
He didn't take much time
to brain wash the underage..

315
00:27:57,364 --> 00:27:59,396
..and innocent youngsters
by giving them money.

316
00:28:02,269 --> 00:28:06,314
He has created a Robin hood image
for himself in Chor bazaar.

317
00:28:08,524 --> 00:28:11,263
That means, we will have to face..

318
00:28:11,343 --> 00:28:12,963
..mass resistance if we try
to arrest him from Chor bazaar.

319
00:28:13,043 --> 00:28:16,939
Arresting Salim Reza
in front of public at Chor bazaar..

320
00:28:17,537 --> 00:28:19,218
..is next to impossible.

321
00:28:19,298 --> 00:28:20,764
- Charlie.
- Sir.

322
00:28:20,844 --> 00:28:22,180
Seeing our way of work it might seem..

323
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:24,917
..that we work
while being emotionless.

324
00:28:24,997 --> 00:28:26,874
But it's emotion
that we have to work with.

325
00:28:26,954 --> 00:28:27,916
- Right?
- Sir.

326
00:28:27,996 --> 00:28:31,603
Thinking about the dead
and their families, do you think..

327
00:28:31,683 --> 00:28:33,301
..anything is next to impossible?

328
00:28:33,984 --> 00:28:35,292
Sorry, sir.

329
00:28:37,483 --> 00:28:38,948
- If our heart beats, then..
- Jai Hind!

330
00:28:39,028 --> 00:28:40,646
- If we breathe, then..
- Jai Hind!

331
00:28:40,726 --> 00:28:42,713
- If we bleed, then..
- Jai Hind!

332
00:29:17,896 --> 00:29:19,599
Sir, just buy it.
It's an awesome set.

333
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:23,704
- It has lollypop android, 3 GB RAM,
and 32 GB in-built memory, sir. - Really?

334
00:29:23,784 --> 00:29:25,689
Both front and back camera with flash.

335
00:29:25,769 --> 00:29:28,773
- You take a photo and check,
you will get beautiful pictures. - Okay.

336
00:29:28,853 --> 00:29:31,256
Sir, it has body less screen
and 4000 MH battery.

337
00:29:31,336 --> 00:29:32,514
- Hey, mister!
- Yes, sir.

338
00:29:32,594 --> 00:29:34,068
What kind of mobile did you sell?

339
00:29:34,148 --> 00:29:36,170
It's not even a month and it has
stopped working. Have a look!

340
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:38,459
Sir, please wait.
Why are you getting so furious?

341
00:29:39,538 --> 00:29:41,218
Sir, this is a China product.

342
00:29:41,298 --> 00:29:43,912
You don't get guarantee
for those, sir.

343
00:29:43,992 --> 00:29:48,153
China, Japan, Italy, France.
I don't know all that.

344
00:29:48,233 --> 00:29:50,333
I had brought it from you.

345
00:29:50,413 --> 00:29:51,606
You gave me China mobile.

346
00:29:51,686 --> 00:29:54,377
Clean this, then clean that.

347
00:29:54,457 --> 00:29:56,986
I had promised that
you'll like the set

348
00:29:57,066 --> 00:29:59,138
but I didn't give you any
guarantee regarding the set.

349
00:29:59,218 --> 00:30:01,968
He said, bring the mobile back
if anything goes wrong.

350
00:30:02,048 --> 00:30:03,459
- So I brought it back.
- I am checking it, sir.

351
00:30:03,539 --> 00:30:04,495
Why are you getting angry?

352
00:30:04,575 --> 00:30:05,868
- Bablu, check the set!
- Look mister, I can't charge it..

353
00:30:05,948 --> 00:30:07,715
- ..can't call anyone, nothing is
functional. - Just check the problem.

354
00:30:07,795 --> 00:30:09,903
Why will Bablu check it?

355
00:30:09,983 --> 00:30:11,524
You had given me the
mobile, you check it.

356
00:30:11,604 --> 00:30:13,592
- Okay sir, I'll check it.
- He doesn't even reduce the amount.

357
00:30:13,672 --> 00:30:14,943
Is this mobile Bablu's product?

358
00:30:15,023 --> 00:30:16,924
- Sir, it's processor is damaged.
- What?

359
00:30:17,004 --> 00:30:19,032
Let me show you a new mobile.

360
00:30:19,112 --> 00:30:20,873
Sir, stop fussing please.

361
00:30:20,953 --> 00:30:23,402
It's a new set in the market.
An awesome set. Smooth operations.

362
00:30:23,482 --> 00:30:25,266
Sir, it has both
front and back camera.

363
00:30:25,346 --> 00:30:27,441
When you click photos of yourself,
you will look like a hero.

364
00:30:27,521 --> 00:30:28,583
Won't it conk out?

365
00:30:28,663 --> 00:30:30,682
Sir, may your enemy's
cell phone conk out.

366
00:30:30,762 --> 00:30:32,245
Change my name
if the mobile conks out.

367
00:30:32,325 --> 00:30:33,402
You are talking too much.

368
00:30:34,331 --> 00:30:35,699
It looks good.

369
00:30:35,779 --> 00:30:37,404
- Not just looks, it functions well too.
- Okay, I am taking this.

370
00:30:37,484 --> 00:30:39,503
Sir, what do you mean by taking it?

371
00:30:39,583 --> 00:30:41,858
Leave my hand.
Sir, who will pay for the phone?

372
00:30:42,231 --> 00:30:44,768
This man thinks I am crazy.

373
00:30:44,848 --> 00:30:46,017
What do you mean?

374
00:30:46,097 --> 00:30:47,416
You are taking the mobile,
won't you pay for it?

375
00:30:47,496 --> 00:30:48,257
The previous set conked off.

376
00:30:48,337 --> 00:30:49,881
He gave me this mobile
in exchange of this.

377
00:30:49,961 --> 00:30:51,224
How can you run
away with my mobile?

378
00:30:51,304 --> 00:30:53,350
- Do you think I am crazy? - Why do
you sell lousy stuff to people?

379
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:55,499
We are here to do business.
You are a menace.

380
00:30:55,579 --> 00:30:58,470
Don't act smart with me in my area.

381
00:30:58,802 --> 00:31:00,503
Sir, listen..

382
00:31:00,583 --> 00:31:02,500
Forget about the exchange.

383
00:31:03,243 --> 00:31:04,192
Watch your steps.

384
00:31:04,272 --> 00:31:06,313
Be careful. Will you break it?

385
00:31:06,393 --> 00:31:07,766
He was running away with my mobile.

386
00:31:07,846 --> 00:31:09,926
- Leave my hand.
- What do you mean by leave your hand?

387
00:31:11,654 --> 00:31:14,744
- Hit him.
- Leave me.

388
00:31:14,824 --> 00:31:17,016
- Catch him.
- Leave me.

389
00:31:17,384 --> 00:31:19,001
Chotu, check what's wrong?

390
00:31:19,081 --> 00:31:20,967
Yes, I will check right away.

391
00:31:21,998 --> 00:31:23,092
Hit him.

392
00:31:25,079 --> 00:31:26,844
Leave me.

393
00:31:29,702 --> 00:31:31,222
Leave me.

394
00:31:42,998 --> 00:31:44,898
Don't touch me.

395
00:31:46,175 --> 00:31:48,303
- Leave me.
- Hit him.

396
00:31:50,738 --> 00:31:52,274
Target captured.

397
00:31:52,354 --> 00:31:54,412
Shut up.

398
00:31:55,955 --> 00:31:57,456
Silence, everyone.

399
00:31:58,356 --> 00:32:02,442
First, you sell bad quality mobile
and on top of that you hit me too.

400
00:32:02,964 --> 00:32:04,798
I don't want your mobile. Keep it.

401
00:32:05,254 --> 00:32:07,377
Don't ever come back to this area.

402
00:32:07,572 --> 00:32:09,361
Get lost!

403
00:32:09,494 --> 00:32:11,974
If you come back, I'll break
your legs and play Hockey with it.

404
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:34,184
Who had given the orders
for the serial blasts?

405
00:32:34,264 --> 00:32:38,387
Sir, I don't know anything.

406
00:32:38,741 --> 00:32:41,924
Believe me, I don't know anything.

407
00:33:12,188 --> 00:33:16,168
I am asking you again.
Who gave the orders for the blasts?

408
00:33:18,184 --> 00:33:21,273
Sir, I didn't do anything.

409
00:33:32,291 --> 00:33:34,262
What are you doing, sir?

410
00:33:35,058 --> 00:33:36,575
What are you doing, sir?

411
00:33:44,049 --> 00:33:45,472
Sir, I don't know anything.

412
00:33:45,552 --> 00:33:48,045
I don't know anything.
Believe me, sir.

413
00:33:53,113 --> 00:33:57,481
I know that I'm a Muslim and that's
why I am being tortured like this.

414
00:33:57,713 --> 00:34:00,802
This country can never
accept the Muslims.

415
00:34:03,459 --> 00:34:05,734
Everyone has equal
rights in this country.

416
00:34:06,227 --> 00:34:10,479
Be it Hindu, Muslim, Sikh,
Christian or any other religion.

417
00:34:10,559 --> 00:34:13,161
No. We Muslims, know
it well that this..

418
00:34:13,241 --> 00:34:15,803
..country never treats
us as it's own.

419
00:34:15,883 --> 00:34:19,035
Shut up, you scoundrel, or
else I'll tear your tongue out.

420
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,443
By calling yourself a
Muslim, don't..

421
00:34:21,523 --> 00:34:23,267
..degrade the entire
Muslim community.

422
00:34:24,649 --> 00:34:28,147
You are a terrorist and a
terrorist has no religion.

423
00:34:29,293 --> 00:34:31,380
Calling himself a Muslim!

424
00:34:33,207 --> 00:34:35,111
I am not aware of my religion.

425
00:34:35,191 --> 00:34:39,944
But I know this much
that for a true Indian..

426
00:34:40,024 --> 00:34:41,467
"Whenever and wherever
there is a decline in.."

427
00:34:41,547 --> 00:34:42,976
"..religious practice,
O descendant of Bharata.."

428
00:34:43,056 --> 00:34:44,754
"..and a predominant rise of irreligion,
at that time I descend Myself.''

429
00:34:44,834 --> 00:34:48,523
''For the protection of the good,
the destruction of the wicked..

430
00:34:48,734 --> 00:34:50,536
"..and the establishment
of righteousness.."

431
00:34:50,616 --> 00:34:53,261
"..I am born in every age"
is as important as..

432
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:57,942
''Allah is the greatest, Allah is the
greatest, there is no God but Allah.''

433
00:34:58,185 --> 00:35:00,757
''And Allah is the greatest,
Allah is the greatest and.."

434
00:35:00,837 --> 00:35:03,367
"..to Allah belongs all praise."

435
00:35:14,939 --> 00:35:17,879
Sir, I don't know anything.

436
00:35:18,682 --> 00:35:19,988
Salim.

437
00:35:21,708 --> 00:35:24,104
I am asking you for the last time.
Tell me the truth.

438
00:35:24,184 --> 00:35:26,618
Who had given the
orders for the serial blasts?

439
00:35:28,530 --> 00:35:30,940
Or else I will leave you in
such a state that you won't be..

440
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:33,243
..able to say anything
through out your life.

441
00:35:33,797 --> 00:35:34,842
No.

442
00:35:38,466 --> 00:35:41,133
No. Sir,
I will tell you everything.

443
00:35:41,474 --> 00:35:44,068
I will tell you everything.

444
00:35:53,975 --> 00:35:56,008
Sir, as per Salim's confession..

445
00:35:56,088 --> 00:35:59,285
..Aman Hassan and Samir Hassan
had ordered for these attacks.

446
00:35:59,816 --> 00:36:01,514
Sir, If we don't catch
them, we won't be able to..

447
00:36:01,594 --> 00:36:03,327
..get to know about their plans
regarding the next attacks.

448
00:36:03,407 --> 00:36:05,876
And as per information,
Aman Hassan and Samir Hassan..

449
00:36:05,956 --> 00:36:08,289
..have already left for
Al-Dera with their family.

450
00:36:08,681 --> 00:36:10,643
Ma'am, in Al-Dera Indian
Embassy, do we have any..

451
00:36:10,998 --> 00:36:14,567
..reliable source who can
be contacted immediately?

452
00:36:14,722 --> 00:36:16,046
It will be too late sir.

453
00:36:16,608 --> 00:36:18,671
I am going to Al-Dera. I have
already booked my tickets.

454
00:36:18,751 --> 00:36:20,328
But Panther, without government..

455
00:36:20,408 --> 00:36:22,914
One day has already past
after the Mumbai blast.

456
00:36:22,994 --> 00:36:24,627
There will be another
serial blast after two days.

457
00:36:24,707 --> 00:36:27,430
Are you saying that we will wait
for permission even after this?

458
00:36:27,581 --> 00:36:28,644
Sir.

459
00:36:31,982 --> 00:36:34,701
Sir, you had taught us that nothing
is greater than our country.

460
00:36:34,904 --> 00:36:36,596
And this mission
is for our country.

461
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:38,893
So it's good if our
country gives us the..

462
00:36:38,973 --> 00:36:40,866
..permission for this
mission and if it doesn't..

463
00:36:41,448 --> 00:36:42,741
..then it's even better, sir.

464
00:36:43,237 --> 00:36:45,314
- Are you sure, Panther?
- Yes.

465
00:36:47,009 --> 00:36:49,787
The mission approval is
not solely in my hand.

466
00:36:49,867 --> 00:36:52,790
And I hope, you are aware
of the repercussions of..

467
00:36:52,870 --> 00:36:55,453
..initiating a mission without
government approval.

468
00:36:56,533 --> 00:36:58,377
I know, ma'am. The government
will not take responsibility..

469
00:36:58,457 --> 00:37:00,441
..of even a small mistake made by me.

470
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:03,781
And as I'm on this mission without
the approval of Indian government,

471
00:37:04,091 --> 00:37:07,789
I assume, Al-Dera government also
won't support me and that's fine.

472
00:37:08,868 --> 00:37:12,092
Actually, ma'am, terrorism is the
cancer of modern world politics.

473
00:37:12,172 --> 00:37:14,070
And I'll do everything
that needs to..

474
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:15,973
..be done in order to
treat the cancer.

475
00:37:16,185 --> 00:37:19,355
Ray, chemotherapy, operation,
whatever is needed.

476
00:37:19,435 --> 00:37:21,924
I will destroy the
cancer affected cell..

477
00:37:22,004 --> 00:37:24,419
..and will save the
non affected cells.

478
00:37:24,599 --> 00:37:29,673
Ma'am, I promise, I will uproot
terrorism completely.

479
00:37:29,876 --> 00:37:32,963
I like your attitude.
All the best to you.

480
00:37:33,043 --> 00:37:34,149
Thank you, ma'am.

481
00:37:35,775 --> 00:37:36,935
- Panther.
- Sir.

482
00:37:37,306 --> 00:37:40,012
A special friend of mine, Jahangir,
will receive you at Al-Dera.

483
00:37:41,305 --> 00:37:43,493
- You can depend on him.
- Right, sir.

484
00:37:43,612 --> 00:37:45,224
I want India safe.

485
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,265
India will always be safe, sir.

486
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:49,394
- Jai Hind!
- Jai Hind, sir!

487
00:38:17,631 --> 00:38:20,191
- Have you ever been to the
maze at Lucknow? - Pardon?

488
00:38:20,271 --> 00:38:23,049
Actually, it's an Imambara but
people know it as a maze.

489
00:38:23,914 --> 00:38:25,699
- Have you been there?
- No. Why?

490
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:27,682
If you ever visit then
you will see that there..

491
00:38:27,762 --> 00:38:29,279
..are walking paths in
between the walls.

492
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:32,611
But if you enter those paths, then
you won't be able to come out ever.

493
00:38:32,909 --> 00:38:35,262
But as of now I want to
get out of this airport.

494
00:38:36,770 --> 00:38:38,762
I am coming to that.

495
00:38:38,842 --> 00:38:42,734
The formula to get out of the
maze is, always turn left.

496
00:38:43,834 --> 00:38:45,571
Did you get it?

497
00:38:46,076 --> 00:38:47,626
- Are you Jahangir?
- Yes.

498
00:38:47,706 --> 00:38:50,476
But neither my dad was Akbar,
nor is my son Shah Jahan.

499
00:38:52,034 --> 00:38:54,358
Come to the parking area.
We will meet there.

500
00:38:56,033 --> 00:38:58,995
Are you always invisible like
this or do you actually appear?

501
00:38:59,168 --> 00:39:00,282
Good question.

502
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:03,292
There was a time when I desperately
wanted to become Mr India.

503
00:39:03,372 --> 00:39:05,132
But that didn't happen.

504
00:39:05,212 --> 00:39:08,059
So I try to live like Mr India,
as much as I can.

505
00:39:08,139 --> 00:39:09,914
Clear? Hi! I am Jahangir.

506
00:39:12,778 --> 00:39:16,507
Hi! You must be knowing that we
are here on a serious mission.

507
00:39:16,724 --> 00:39:18,398
What was the need of
this unnecessary build-up?

508
00:39:18,882 --> 00:39:21,152
Young man,
the build-up was much needed.

509
00:39:21,232 --> 00:39:23,150
Recently,
I was diagnosed with Diabetes.

510
00:39:23,692 --> 00:39:26,249
And my daughter is arriving
today from India for her holidays.

511
00:39:27,418 --> 00:39:29,798
So I was finishing off the
coffee with sugar for the last time..

512
00:39:29,878 --> 00:39:32,558
..as I won't be able to have this
coffee till the time she is around.

513
00:39:33,555 --> 00:39:38,218
My black Fortuner is in
the parking lot. 35308.

514
00:39:38,814 --> 00:39:40,702
You go ahead,
I'll come with my daughter.

515
00:40:00,498 --> 00:40:01,544
You?!

516
00:40:04,382 --> 00:40:05,382
You?!

517
00:40:06,423 --> 00:40:07,613
What are you doing here?

518
00:40:09,003 --> 00:40:10,200
Just a second.

519
00:40:11,694 --> 00:40:14,649
I was asked to sit in this car.

520
00:40:14,945 --> 00:40:16,599
Listen, I have had enough.

521
00:40:16,938 --> 00:40:21,809
Wherever I go, you follow me
and try to put me in trouble.

522
00:40:23,048 --> 00:40:26,016
I didn't put you in trouble.
I saved you from trouble.

523
00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:27,822
I am trying to
understand that you..

524
00:40:28,010 --> 00:40:29,178
You have understood a lot.

525
00:40:29,258 --> 00:40:31,541
You don't have to try so hard
to understand me.

526
00:40:32,229 --> 00:40:35,232
Please just go from here.
Go. Otherwise..

527
00:40:37,259 --> 00:40:39,577
If not then I will inform
the police right away.

528
00:40:39,944 --> 00:40:43,611
- I am here.
- Here you are! She..

529
00:40:43,797 --> 00:40:48,406
She is my daughter. Zia.
Professional dancer.

530
00:40:49,277 --> 00:40:50,377
- Dad.
- Yes.

531
00:40:50,751 --> 00:40:53,436
Dad, please ask this
man to go from here.

532
00:40:53,601 --> 00:40:55,843
- Why? - Being with this man
is like inviting trouble.

533
00:40:55,923 --> 00:40:57,919
This was the man in the school too.

534
00:40:57,999 --> 00:41:00,409
You don't know how
dangerous this man is.

535
00:41:00,719 --> 00:41:02,553
It's natural to be dangerous.

536
00:41:03,306 --> 00:41:06,662
Because he is Panther.

537
00:41:07,236 --> 00:41:09,533
The best undercover agent of RAW.

538
00:41:10,813 --> 00:41:15,649
Come, get inside the car.
Come along.

539
00:41:16,404 --> 00:41:19,538
- Sir.
- Yes. Get in the car.

540
00:41:21,289 --> 00:41:22,355
Sir.

541
00:41:54,294 --> 00:41:56,086
Zia, stop the car.

542
00:41:57,823 --> 00:41:58,833
What happened?

543
00:41:59,982 --> 00:42:01,906
I will explain everything.

544
00:42:02,508 --> 00:42:04,625
Mr Jahangir,
I don't have any time at all.

545
00:42:05,366 --> 00:42:07,026
Now, I too don't have the time.

546
00:42:07,213 --> 00:42:08,389
Zia, move.

547
00:42:09,504 --> 00:42:12,278
What does that mean?
Where are we going?

548
00:42:12,444 --> 00:42:14,256
It's not in our hand now.

549
00:42:14,602 --> 00:42:16,719
What do you mean by
it's not in our hand?

550
00:42:17,156 --> 00:42:20,491
Now we have to follow
the car ahead of us.

551
00:42:21,411 --> 00:42:22,525
Who's car is it?

552
00:42:22,705 --> 00:42:25,105
That car belongs to the embassy
of our neighbouring country.

553
00:42:25,847 --> 00:42:28,075
- So?
- Shafiq Reza is sitting in it.

554
00:42:28,268 --> 00:42:29,451
He is the embassy head.

555
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:31,906
Hassan brothers are
the most important..

556
00:42:31,986 --> 00:42:34,023
..issue to our
neighboring country now.

557
00:42:35,313 --> 00:42:38,115
And if my guess is not
wrong, then Shafiq..

558
00:42:38,399 --> 00:42:40,876
..is going to the new location
of the Hassan brothers now.

559
00:42:42,201 --> 00:42:45,748
Shafiq is an expert in this kind
of unethical notorious tasks.

560
00:42:56,424 --> 00:42:57,559
Zia, stop.

561
00:43:08,275 --> 00:43:09,894
We have come to the right place.

562
00:43:10,081 --> 00:43:12,482
It seems Hassan family
is kept in this house.

563
00:43:14,101 --> 00:43:16,433
To be sure, we have to get inside
this house somehow.

564
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:18,902
You may go if you want to.

565
00:43:18,982 --> 00:43:21,133
But please do not involve us
in your stupidity.

566
00:43:21,275 --> 00:43:22,590
Zia, calm down.

567
00:43:23,004 --> 00:43:24,734
Panther, this is Al Dera.

568
00:43:24,814 --> 00:43:27,290
The police here do not torture
in a decent way.

569
00:43:27,647 --> 00:43:29,571
Jahangir, you might not be aware of..

570
00:43:29,651 --> 00:43:31,684
..the first policy
of our RAW founder.

571
00:43:31,909 --> 00:43:35,161
That's to keep the words fear, pain
and failure out of our dictionary.

572
00:43:36,524 --> 00:43:38,028
But you won't understand all this.
Let me go.

573
00:43:38,108 --> 00:43:39,229
Zia, move.

574
00:43:40,327 --> 00:43:43,006
Stop the car. Stop the car please.

575
00:43:43,491 --> 00:43:45,843
What is this Jahangir?
Jahangir, turn..

576
00:43:48,638 --> 00:43:50,333
Greetings, Aman.

577
00:43:53,137 --> 00:43:54,493
Greetings, Shafiq.

578
00:44:04,173 --> 00:44:06,602
Is everything well? Yes, brother.

579
00:44:06,865 --> 00:44:09,185
- Hope you are not uncomfortable here.
- Not at all, brother.

580
00:44:09,356 --> 00:44:10,664
Brother! B-B..

581
00:44:13,389 --> 00:44:15,105
He is Samir, my younger brother.

582
00:44:15,368 --> 00:44:18,578
Samir, I had told you about
Shafiq. He is Shafiq.

583
00:44:21,187 --> 00:44:24,937
- Greetings!
- Greetings, young man.

584
00:44:25,511 --> 00:44:28,583
Hope you all are not
uncomfortable here.

585
00:44:30,133 --> 00:44:31,870
No, Shafiq, not at all.

586
00:44:32,489 --> 00:44:34,495
You are an amazing host.

587
00:44:37,485 --> 00:44:41,191
Young man,
tell me if you have any problem.

588
00:44:41,602 --> 00:44:44,241
It's my responsibility to
take care of all your issues.

589
00:44:46,208 --> 00:44:49,844
- No, I mean, my wife Tabassum..
- Yes.

590
00:44:49,924 --> 00:44:53,177
- We need to take her to a
doctor urgently. - I see.

591
00:44:53,545 --> 00:44:55,932
I mean, there's still time
for her delivery.

592
00:44:56,012 --> 00:44:56,905
Just a minute.

593
00:44:59,346 --> 00:45:03,239
Delivery? That means
your wife is pregnant.

594
00:45:06,333 --> 00:45:07,745
Are those medical documents? Yes.

595
00:45:37,052 --> 00:45:38,545
What did you just do?

596
00:45:38,739 --> 00:45:40,840
It had all the records
of my wife's treatment.

597
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:42,176
Our government..

598
00:45:43,527 --> 00:45:47,346
..is extremely serious about
your safety and security.

599
00:45:50,352 --> 00:45:53,889
Until yesterday you all
were Indian citizen.

600
00:45:54,819 --> 00:46:00,000
But from today you all are neither
Samir, nor Aman nor Tabassum.

601
00:46:00,470 --> 00:46:03,537
You and your family
never lived in India.

602
00:46:18,297 --> 00:46:20,915
If you have anymore
documents with old identity..

603
00:46:21,722 --> 00:46:22,912
..then destroy them all.

604
00:46:30,582 --> 00:46:31,371
Yes, Panther.

605
00:46:31,451 --> 00:46:32,949
Sir, I don't need this
man named Jahangir.

606
00:46:33,029 --> 00:46:35,036
- But, Panther..
- Sir, please allow me to speak.

607
00:46:35,241 --> 00:46:37,897
This man has no idea
about our organisation.

608
00:46:38,036 --> 00:46:39,240
I wonder what he thinks of himself?

609
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:41,396
He behaves as if he is not a
RAW agent but the chief of RAW.

610
00:46:41,476 --> 00:46:43,046
Calm down, Panther. Calm down.

611
00:46:43,804 --> 00:46:46,366
The person about whom you
were talking all this while..

612
00:46:47,107 --> 00:46:49,192
- ..do you know his real name?
- Yes. It's Jahangir.

613
00:46:49,272 --> 00:46:50,954
Wrong. It's a code name.

614
00:46:51,569 --> 00:46:53,395
His real name is Feroze Khan.

615
00:46:54,343 --> 00:46:55,893
I hope you have heard of him.

616
00:46:57,132 --> 00:46:59,131
- Feroze Khan?!
- Feroze Khan.

617
00:46:59,451 --> 00:47:02,729
You mean, the founder of our
organisation, Feroze Khan?

618
00:47:02,809 --> 00:47:06,543
Our organisation still works
as per the policies made by him.

619
00:47:07,185 --> 00:47:09,953
The training procedure
that we maintain till today..

620
00:47:10,894 --> 00:47:12,443
..is made by him.

621
00:47:14,509 --> 00:47:15,516
Excuse me.

622
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:18,987
If you are done
complaining about my dad..

623
00:47:19,067 --> 00:47:21,448
..then I need to talk to you
regarding an important matter.

624
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:25,895
Sir, I will talk to you later.

625
00:47:31,254 --> 00:47:32,349
Tell me.

626
00:47:33,019 --> 00:47:35,786
Listen, whatever you want to do with..

627
00:47:35,866 --> 00:47:38,839
..your life is
completely your decision.

628
00:47:39,606 --> 00:47:43,414
But please, don't involve
my dad in your mess.

629
00:47:45,273 --> 00:47:48,998
Throughout my life I have
seen my mom live in fear..

630
00:47:50,138 --> 00:47:53,066
..which lead to heart
ailment and after that..

631
00:47:54,278 --> 00:47:55,423
..everything was finished.

632
00:47:57,550 --> 00:47:59,692
I don't want to live in
fear like my mom did.

633
00:47:59,841 --> 00:48:04,470
Zia, whatever sir has been doing all
these years, is all for our country.

634
00:48:05,752 --> 00:48:09,578
Our country is..
proud of such a man, Zia.

635
00:48:09,894 --> 00:48:13,081
I know. I know that the country
should come first.

636
00:48:13,357 --> 00:48:16,490
I know this too that I
am alive because of you.

637
00:48:16,982 --> 00:48:19,063
But seeing you at the
airport, I understood..

638
00:48:19,501 --> 00:48:21,267
..that my dad is not safe anymore.

639
00:48:21,783 --> 00:48:24,600
And I also know this
that your association..

640
00:48:24,738 --> 00:48:27,927
..will increase the risk to my
dad's life. And I won't allow it.

641
00:48:28,093 --> 00:48:30,994
You may call me anti-national,
you may call me selfish..

642
00:48:31,074 --> 00:48:32,803
..you may say whatever you want to.

643
00:48:32,883 --> 00:48:34,746
I really don't care.

644
00:48:44,312 --> 00:48:45,629
I have lost my mom.

645
00:48:47,478 --> 00:48:50,533
And now if my dad is
harmed because of you..

646
00:48:51,741 --> 00:48:53,750
..then I will not spare you.

647
00:48:55,482 --> 00:48:58,692
Listen, it's no use
telling anything to dad.

648
00:48:58,947 --> 00:49:00,807
But I need to tell you.

649
00:49:02,407 --> 00:49:04,095
I have no one else
other than my dad.

650
00:49:05,467 --> 00:49:07,106
And I don't want to be alone.

651
00:49:18,136 --> 00:49:19,492
Good afternoon.

652
00:49:38,589 --> 00:49:40,770
- Are we going to any desert?
- Why?

653
00:49:45,636 --> 00:49:47,305
Because no one,
other than a business man..

654
00:49:47,385 --> 00:49:49,191
..dealing in the desserts,
uses this compass.

655
00:49:54,615 --> 00:49:56,729
Francis was right,
you are the best.

656
00:49:58,700 --> 00:50:00,399
I don't understand what is
best, sir.

657
00:50:00,754 --> 00:50:02,741
I always aspire to
be better in life.

658
00:50:07,716 --> 00:50:08,776
Please come, brother.

659
00:50:14,369 --> 00:50:15,703
Thank you, Shafiq.

660
00:50:16,107 --> 00:50:18,307
Having my wife checked by the
doctor was very important.

661
00:50:18,786 --> 00:50:20,342
I had already told you..

662
00:50:20,504 --> 00:50:23,291
..that I am here to resolve
all your problems.

663
00:50:25,151 --> 00:50:27,581
Come, let's leave. It won't
be right to delay any more.

664
00:50:28,832 --> 00:50:29,922
Come.

665
00:50:36,011 --> 00:50:38,746
Brother, aren't you coming?

666
00:50:38,826 --> 00:50:39,897
No.

667
00:50:40,904 --> 00:50:43,544
Aman will stay in Al Dera for few
more days. He has some work here.

668
00:50:43,873 --> 00:50:45,861
But we have never lived
without brother..

669
00:50:45,941 --> 00:50:46,992
Samir!

670
00:50:51,254 --> 00:50:54,653
Don't forget that this is a war.

671
00:50:55,494 --> 00:50:58,063
And only one person
gives order in a war.

672
00:51:00,581 --> 00:51:02,053
Rest just follow the orders.

673
00:51:05,475 --> 00:51:08,342
Aman has an important work here.
He will meet you all later.

674
00:51:13,666 --> 00:51:14,706
Brother!

675
00:52:14,670 --> 00:52:15,976
What happened, Tabassum?

676
00:52:27,694 --> 00:52:29,829
Sir, apart from the
embassy guards..

677
00:52:29,909 --> 00:52:31,956
..I can see just three members
from the Hassan family.

678
00:52:35,625 --> 00:52:38,229
Please drive faster.

679
00:52:38,309 --> 00:52:39,472
It's moving.

680
00:52:40,243 --> 00:52:42,076
Where are they being taken?
Any idea?

681
00:52:42,399 --> 00:52:47,439
Not very far. As per my intuition,
their people are somewhere close.

682
00:52:48,909 --> 00:52:51,610
They will take the Hassan
family to some other place.

683
00:52:58,919 --> 00:53:02,200
Aman, don't be upset.

684
00:53:03,078 --> 00:53:05,239
Small benefits always had to be..

685
00:53:05,403 --> 00:53:09,699
..sacrificed for big benefits.

686
00:53:10,173 --> 00:53:12,860
- This is the rule of the war.
- I know, Shafiq sir.

687
00:53:13,459 --> 00:53:17,001
The biggest benefit
in the world is money.

688
00:53:20,371 --> 00:53:21,598
I can sacrifice..

689
00:53:23,188 --> 00:53:24,760
..everything for money.

690
00:53:27,066 --> 00:53:28,263
Everything.

691
00:54:05,988 --> 00:54:07,321
Come on.

692
00:54:24,474 --> 00:54:26,259
Sir, the matter is
entering a risky zone.

693
00:54:28,605 --> 00:54:30,044
It's time for action, sir.

694
00:54:31,306 --> 00:54:33,259
Okay, let's go.

695
00:54:34,392 --> 00:54:35,415
Sir.

696
00:54:36,716 --> 00:54:39,435
Sir, please stay here.
I will handle it.

697
00:54:45,284 --> 00:54:47,884
Come on. Move.

698
00:54:48,092 --> 00:54:49,788
- What are you doing?
- Move.

699
00:55:14,823 --> 00:55:16,537
Weren't we supposed
to go to the hospital?

700
00:55:17,289 --> 00:55:20,114
Why did you bring us here?

701
00:55:27,197 --> 00:55:28,608
Why don't you say something?

702
00:55:40,911 --> 00:55:41,964
Don't hit him.

703
00:55:47,981 --> 00:55:49,884
- Please leave him. Don't hit him.
- Hit me as much as you want to.

704
00:55:49,964 --> 00:55:52,605
- No, no.
- Don't do anything to my mom and my wife.

705
00:55:53,059 --> 00:55:55,295
I need to take my
wife to the doctor.

706
00:55:57,216 --> 00:55:58,483
Leave him.

707
00:55:59,404 --> 00:56:01,866
- Leave him please.
- There's no need for a doctor.

708
00:56:02,609 --> 00:56:04,482
We will resolve her sufferings..

709
00:56:05,323 --> 00:56:07,010
..as well as yours.

710
00:56:29,676 --> 00:56:30,886
Who is that?

711
00:56:31,268 --> 00:56:32,339
Come on!

712
00:57:23,455 --> 00:57:24,508
Drop your gun.

713
00:57:26,589 --> 00:57:27,596
Move.

714
00:58:24,566 --> 00:58:25,837
Don't do this mistake.

715
00:58:25,917 --> 00:58:27,848
You might not know my brother.

716
00:58:27,928 --> 00:58:30,334
He, himself, has given the orders of..

717
00:58:30,414 --> 00:58:33,140
..sending you all to
the shelter of Allah.

718
00:58:59,291 --> 00:59:00,331
Who are you?

719
00:59:01,948 --> 00:59:03,524
Quickly leave from
here with your family.

720
00:59:03,604 --> 00:59:07,066
- Come on, go.
- Are you a Bengali?

721
00:59:08,953 --> 00:59:11,747
I am an Indian. Come on, go.
Fast. Come on.

722
00:59:31,784 --> 00:59:33,104
Hey! Stop!

723
00:59:51,363 --> 00:59:52,519
Sir, how come you are here?

724
00:59:52,639 --> 00:59:54,768
During a war,
even animals don't leave their..

725
00:59:54,888 --> 00:59:56,765
..fighters alone and
we are RAW agents.

726
01:00:01,451 --> 01:00:02,575
If our heart beats, then..

727
01:00:04,081 --> 01:00:06,056
- Jai Hind!
- If we breathe, then..

728
01:00:06,176 --> 01:00:08,132
- Jai Hind!
- If we bleed, then..

729
01:00:08,370 --> 01:00:09,588
Jai Hind!

730
01:00:12,339 --> 01:00:15,985
Now I understand, why did
Francis name you as Panther.

731
01:00:16,830 --> 01:00:19,092
Not Lion, not Cheetah, not Tiger..

732
01:00:19,533 --> 01:00:21,637
..even more dangerous than
all of them is Panther.

733
01:00:26,015 --> 01:00:28,074
Sir, no matter how
great a student becomes..

734
01:00:29,773 --> 01:00:31,447
..the teacher is always a teacher.

735
01:00:34,649 --> 01:00:36,549
- Let's move.
- Sir.

736
01:01:15,807 --> 01:01:18,035
Reports have been pouring
in about a massive blast..

737
01:01:18,155 --> 01:01:20,518
..from an abandoned
army base in Al Dera.

738
01:01:20,638 --> 01:01:22,759
Reports have been poring
in about a massive..

739
01:01:22,879 --> 01:01:25,182
..blast from an abandoned
army base in Al Dera.

740
01:01:25,302 --> 01:01:26,467
No one knows the
motive behind it.

741
01:01:26,587 --> 01:01:29,120
Al Dera government has
rejected all demands.

742
01:01:29,482 --> 01:01:30,651
Just wait.

743
01:01:47,376 --> 01:01:48,531
Spider.

744
01:01:49,112 --> 01:01:51,295
- Sir. - Do you have any
information about Panther?

745
01:01:52,442 --> 01:01:54,023
Sir, do you need any
information about the..

746
01:01:54,143 --> 01:01:55,949
..President of America or
North Korean President?

747
01:01:56,069 --> 01:01:57,685
I am asking for the
information about Panther.

748
01:01:57,805 --> 01:01:59,531
He is not a person who will
be out of track for so long?

749
01:01:59,651 --> 01:02:01,404
What a joke, sir!

750
01:02:01,922 --> 01:02:04,530
But my track history says
that in last 5 years..

751
01:02:04,711 --> 01:02:07,014
..we spent most of our time
in order to track Panther.

752
01:02:07,603 --> 01:02:10,069
He is the most irresponsible
cadre I have ever seen.

753
01:02:10,189 --> 01:02:11,305
- I agree with you.
- Then?

754
01:02:11,426 --> 01:02:12,903
- I am not disagreeing with you.
- How will you do it?

755
01:02:13,023 --> 01:02:14,410
- But..
- No ifs and buts.

756
01:02:15,158 --> 01:02:17,133
Till date,
each and every agent of RAW..

757
01:02:17,364 --> 01:02:19,679
..is scared of going ahead
without the tracking..

758
01:02:19,799 --> 01:02:21,736
..device of Spider
but your Panther..

759
01:02:22,239 --> 01:02:23,706
Till date, he didn't
use any of my tracking devices..

760
01:02:23,826 --> 01:02:25,420
..for any mission.
He has such a huge ego.

761
01:02:26,544 --> 01:02:30,165
I'm sorry to say. Our organisation
stands on a discipline.

762
01:02:30,342 --> 01:02:32,423
And Panther is the most
indiscipline person.

763
01:02:32,543 --> 01:02:34,849
You don't need to worry
about Panther's discipline.

764
01:02:34,987 --> 01:02:36,288
- Okay.
- Just track him.

765
01:02:36,408 --> 01:02:37,984
- Okay.
- Right now.

766
01:02:44,323 --> 01:02:45,689
Any news about Jahangir?

767
01:02:45,809 --> 01:02:47,801
No, sir.
But we are trying our best.

768
01:02:47,934 --> 01:02:48,934
Find him.

769
01:02:49,519 --> 01:02:50,993
- As early as possible.
- Right, sir.

770
01:05:31,095 --> 01:05:34,270
I had warned you.
I had told you..

771
01:05:34,478 --> 01:05:37,003
..not to involve my dad in your mess.

772
01:05:40,656 --> 01:05:42,033
But you did exactly that.

773
01:05:43,832 --> 01:05:45,382
You made me lonely.

774
01:05:46,246 --> 01:05:47,348
- Zia.
- Please.

775
01:05:48,496 --> 01:05:49,736
You don't have to say anything.

776
01:05:51,713 --> 01:05:52,834
Nothing at all.

777
01:05:55,754 --> 01:05:57,569
Two of you went on
the same mission.

778
01:05:58,653 --> 01:05:59,940
You returned..

779
01:06:01,336 --> 01:06:04,561
..but my dad died.

780
01:06:08,131 --> 01:06:12,553
Zia, I have returned
just because of your dad.

781
01:06:14,151 --> 01:06:17,970
Yes. Zia.
And Jahangir sir is not dead.

782
01:06:20,273 --> 01:06:22,495
He died as a martyr
for our country.

783
01:06:42,117 --> 01:06:44,148
Sir.. Sir..

784
01:06:44,373 --> 01:06:48,546
Panther,
make sure India stays safe.

785
01:07:11,751 --> 01:07:12,959
Sir!

786
01:07:13,995 --> 01:07:15,019
Sir!

787
01:07:16,253 --> 01:07:17,504
Sir!

788
01:07:17,981 --> 01:07:19,690
Sir!

789
01:07:30,407 --> 01:07:31,470
Yes, Zia.

790
01:07:33,651 --> 01:07:35,865
We should all be
proud of Jahangir sir.

791
01:07:36,771 --> 01:07:37,833
Yes.

792
01:07:38,594 --> 01:07:39,613
We should all be proud.

793
01:07:43,167 --> 01:07:45,026
- I am proud of him.
- Yes.

794
01:07:46,416 --> 01:07:47,944
I am very proud of him.

795
01:07:51,796 --> 01:07:52,836
Panther.

796
01:07:54,199 --> 01:07:56,020
Those who have taken
away my dad's life..

797
01:07:56,246 --> 01:07:58,759
..ensure that they don't take
away any other Zia's dad.

798
01:08:00,592 --> 01:08:01,965
You will punish them.

799
01:08:03,686 --> 01:08:04,743
Promise me.

800
01:08:07,201 --> 01:08:09,375
Promise me.

801
01:09:53,969 --> 01:09:56,236
Panther, are you fine?

802
01:09:57,533 --> 01:09:58,605
Yes, sir, I am fine.

803
01:09:59,136 --> 01:10:02,612
Panther, you don't sound good.
What happened?

804
01:10:05,099 --> 01:10:06,794
Sir, Jahangir is no more with us.

805
01:10:09,796 --> 01:10:11,928
- I need a favour, sir.
- Go on.

806
01:10:12,213 --> 01:10:13,785
I need Spider.

807
01:10:14,378 --> 01:10:15,945
I know he is the
best technical guy.

808
01:10:16,065 --> 01:10:18,367
And we need the best
people for this mission.

809
01:10:18,938 --> 01:10:20,235
I will manage Spider.

810
01:10:20,355 --> 01:10:21,993
Whatever it takes,
convince him and..

811
01:10:22,113 --> 01:10:23,718
..send him here as soon as possible.
Please.

812
01:10:24,846 --> 01:10:27,597
Alright. It will be done.

813
01:10:27,783 --> 01:10:30,063
- Thank you, sir.
- Hey, Panther.

814
01:10:30,749 --> 01:10:31,855
Sir.

815
01:10:32,816 --> 01:10:33,971
If our heart beats, then..

816
01:10:35,033 --> 01:10:36,251
Jai Hind!

817
01:10:36,672 --> 01:10:38,449
- If we breathe, then..
- Jai Hind!

818
01:10:38,576 --> 01:10:40,491
- If we bleed, then..
- Jai Hind!

819
01:10:41,260 --> 01:10:42,478
Jai Hind!

820
01:10:50,538 --> 01:10:52,032
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

821
01:10:53,028 --> 01:10:54,794
- Good morning, sir.
- Morning.

822
01:11:01,977 --> 01:11:03,428
- Good morning, sir.
- Morning.

823
01:11:05,083 --> 01:11:08,071
Get ready, Spider. You have to
catch a flight in 2 hours time.

824
01:11:08,191 --> 01:11:09,756
Where are we going, sir?

825
01:11:09,876 --> 01:11:12,434
Not we, you alone are going.
I see.

826
01:11:12,755 --> 01:11:14,825
- You have to go to Al Dera.
- Al Dera!

827
01:11:18,407 --> 01:11:19,978
- Al Dera?
- Yes.

828
01:11:20,098 --> 01:11:21,606
- That means, Panther?
- Panther.

829
01:11:21,777 --> 01:11:24,345
Sir, finally in the hands of
international criminals..

830
01:11:25,343 --> 01:11:27,262
Spider, before you start
reacting, listen to me.

831
01:11:27,382 --> 01:11:28,641
- No, sir, you..
- I said, listen..

832
01:11:28,761 --> 01:11:29,761
You listen to me.

833
01:11:29,936 --> 01:11:34,408
Sir, there's no question
of working with Panther.

834
01:11:34,718 --> 01:11:36,879
Last time I was saved
because of my luck.

835
01:11:36,999 --> 01:11:39,084
But if I go this time then 100%..

836
01:11:39,686 --> 01:11:42,162
I mean, I will be dead.
Instead, let me do something.

837
01:11:42,308 --> 01:11:44,841
Sir, I resign.

838
01:11:49,627 --> 01:11:52,089
No, no, sir. Besides,
I have promised my wife that..

839
01:11:52,209 --> 01:11:53,991
..we will go for an
Europe tour next year.

840
01:11:54,111 --> 01:11:58,676
Then, if I..
then my wife will be furious, sir.

841
01:11:59,244 --> 01:12:01,746
Calm down.
I think you should calm down.

842
01:12:01,866 --> 01:12:04,907
I can calm down, sir, but
working with Panther is..

843
01:12:05,486 --> 01:12:07,363
- Are you sure?
- Sir, there's no confusion in this.

844
01:12:08,396 --> 01:12:10,588
Okay, then let me inform Panther..

845
01:12:10,866 --> 01:12:12,442
..as he had made the request.

846
01:12:15,490 --> 01:12:18,819
Panther had requested?
I mean, for me?

847
01:12:20,254 --> 01:12:22,632
Because he thinks you are the
best technical guy we have.

848
01:12:25,588 --> 01:12:28,794
You mean,
Panther told this himself?

849
01:12:28,914 --> 01:12:31,478
Even he is the best
undercover agent we have.

850
01:12:32,212 --> 01:12:33,431
No doubt about it.

851
01:12:34,147 --> 01:12:35,502
- Even I feel so.
- Well..

852
01:12:35,675 --> 01:12:37,555
And the combination
of two best person

853
01:12:37,947 --> 01:12:39,722
was much needed for this mission.

854
01:12:39,842 --> 01:12:41,710
But when you don't want
to work with Panther..

855
01:12:41,830 --> 01:12:43,495
No, no, sir.

856
01:12:43,805 --> 01:12:47,834
When Panther has himself agreed
that I am the best technical guy..

857
01:12:48,260 --> 01:12:50,128
..then I can..

858
01:12:50,248 --> 01:12:53,001
..think of going
for this one mission..

859
01:12:54,325 --> 01:12:55,344
..with him, sir.

860
01:12:59,419 --> 01:13:01,682
But, sir..

861
01:13:02,873 --> 01:13:04,472
..since I am going with Panther..

862
01:13:05,105 --> 01:13:07,957
..if anything happens to me..

863
01:13:09,316 --> 01:13:12,057
..please arrange for the
Europe tour for my wife.

864
01:13:13,491 --> 01:13:16,504
Okay.
But who will go along with her?

865
01:13:17,806 --> 01:13:19,723
I won't be there so
she will go alone.

866
01:13:42,139 --> 01:13:43,175
I knew it.

867
01:13:43,635 --> 01:13:46,338
He'll bring me here and then play
hide and seek. Disgusting man!

868
01:13:49,328 --> 01:13:51,208
He might have switched
off all the trackers too.

869
01:13:53,282 --> 01:13:54,911
I don't know with
whom am I stuck with.

870
01:13:57,822 --> 01:14:00,744
My name is Spider. My network is
spread are all around the world.

871
01:14:00,865 --> 01:14:03,947
How many networks will he destroy
and how many times will he fool me?

872
01:14:05,059 --> 01:14:07,371
Some day, I will definitely..

873
01:14:28,325 --> 01:14:29,435
Hello!

874
01:14:39,371 --> 01:14:40,428
Panther.

875
01:14:42,098 --> 01:14:43,134
Panther.

876
01:14:46,557 --> 01:14:48,276
You have the tracker to track me.

877
01:14:48,396 --> 01:14:51,859
But I have the tracker
to track your device.

878
01:14:53,441 --> 01:14:55,873
I agree you had gifted
me this watch in Berlin.

879
01:14:55,993 --> 01:14:58,774
But that doesn't means that you
will insert a chip in it.

880
01:14:58,894 --> 01:15:00,073
That is my work.

881
01:15:01,547 --> 01:15:03,040
You must be aware of my work too.

882
01:15:04,528 --> 01:15:06,271
No, no, I know I did a
big mistake coming here..

883
01:15:06,391 --> 01:15:08,072
..but that doesn't mean
you will bully me..

884
01:15:10,138 --> 01:15:11,157
Get inside.

885
01:15:14,566 --> 01:15:16,271
Samir Hassan and his family.

886
01:15:16,829 --> 01:15:18,795
They were involved
in the Mumbai blast.

887
01:15:20,407 --> 01:15:23,626
But they have no more information
about the upcoming blasts.

888
01:15:23,746 --> 01:15:24,955
Impossible.

889
01:15:25,725 --> 01:15:28,833
I don't believe that they
don't have any information.

890
01:15:30,507 --> 01:15:31,787
- Spider.
- Yes?

891
01:15:31,965 --> 01:15:34,298
I have done all kind of
investigation from my end.

892
01:15:35,237 --> 01:15:37,177
They really don't have
any more information.

893
01:15:38,004 --> 01:15:40,175
Panther, no one gives
information just like that.

894
01:15:40,295 --> 01:15:42,302
You need to
acquire information.

895
01:15:45,104 --> 01:15:46,295
Go, try out.

896
01:15:47,822 --> 01:15:50,098
- Yes.
- Thank you.

897
01:16:05,352 --> 01:16:06,339
Hello!

898
01:16:08,985 --> 01:16:10,191
Hello!

899
01:16:19,353 --> 01:16:21,279
You have no information, right?

900
01:16:21,399 --> 01:16:24,733
I mean, they killed so many
people without any information.

901
01:16:25,790 --> 01:16:28,204
I am telling the truth, sir.
I don't know anything.

902
01:16:28,545 --> 01:16:32,171
I mean, we just used to
follow my brother's orders.

903
01:16:32,517 --> 01:16:33,324
I am telling the truth, sir.

904
01:16:33,444 --> 01:16:36,333
I just did whatever my
elder brother asked me to do.

905
01:16:36,453 --> 01:16:39,013
Today onwards, you will do whatever
this brother tells you to do.

906
01:16:41,637 --> 01:16:44,728
Spectacles. It's a gift.

907
01:16:46,111 --> 01:16:47,273
This is a watch.

908
01:17:05,777 --> 01:17:07,229
Do you remember?

909
01:17:07,922 --> 01:17:09,255
No, right?

910
01:17:09,813 --> 01:17:11,553
Panther, what is happening?

911
01:17:20,654 --> 01:17:22,364
Sir.. Sir..

912
01:17:22,594 --> 01:17:25,812
- Relax.
- Kill us, sir.

913
01:17:26,448 --> 01:17:29,189
Kill us all, sir.

914
01:17:30,932 --> 01:17:35,986
Sir, if the brother, for whom
I did so much, wants to kill us..

915
01:17:36,106 --> 01:17:39,277
..then we have no right to live, sir.

916
01:17:43,497 --> 01:17:47,932
I just have one request.

917
01:17:48,175 --> 01:17:49,510
Request? Okay.

918
01:17:51,717 --> 01:17:53,240
What request?

919
01:17:53,360 --> 01:17:57,974
Sir, take us to our
country and kill us.

920
01:17:58,094 --> 01:17:58,916
In this country?

921
01:17:59,036 --> 01:18:01,250
Sir, I want to die
in my own mother land.

922
01:18:01,370 --> 01:18:03,036
Before committing
the crime he wasn't..

923
01:18:03,156 --> 01:18:04,916
..even aware that
India is his country.

924
01:18:10,107 --> 01:18:13,643
Sir, I will die in my country.

925
01:18:14,514 --> 01:18:16,618
I just want to say this much.

926
01:18:26,329 --> 01:18:30,173
No. These people
have no information.

927
01:18:31,232 --> 01:18:33,683
Thank you, Spider,
for giving us this news.

928
01:18:33,803 --> 01:18:38,929
It's okay. I think, we should send
them back to India immediately.

929
01:18:39,049 --> 01:18:41,951
But it will not be easy to
send them back to India now.

930
01:18:42,159 --> 01:18:45,570
Shafiq Reza and his men are
looking for them like crazy.

931
01:18:45,799 --> 01:18:48,801
It's extremely risky to
get them out from here.

932
01:18:50,069 --> 01:18:54,686
Hearing the word risk..
something happens in my stomach..

933
01:18:54,806 --> 01:18:56,654
Anyway, all this is not my job.

934
01:18:56,774 --> 01:18:58,996
Instead, I will go..

935
01:18:59,116 --> 01:19:01,276
Spider, over here, there is
nothing like your or mine.

936
01:19:01,567 --> 01:19:03,755
Whatever we are doing, we
are doing it for our country.

937
01:19:03,875 --> 01:19:06,544
We? No, no. What do you mean?

938
01:19:06,664 --> 01:19:08,284
We? What do you mean to say?

939
01:19:08,404 --> 01:19:10,196
Do you want me to take them
with me to India?

940
01:19:10,316 --> 01:19:12,005
No. You will make
arrangements so that..

941
01:19:12,125 --> 01:19:14,045
..they are able to get
out of this country.

942
01:19:14,200 --> 01:19:19,285
I mean, you will prepare their fake
documents like visa, passport, etc.

943
01:19:20,046 --> 01:19:22,920
I knew it. You will put me
in mess when I come here.

944
01:19:23,040 --> 01:19:25,951
All these illegal job
in a foreign nation..

945
01:19:28,390 --> 01:19:29,448
I can't do it.

946
01:19:29,822 --> 01:19:30,822
Spider, please.

947
01:19:35,445 --> 01:19:38,326
If you don't help, this
mission will not be successful.

948
01:19:38,638 --> 01:19:40,817
Why are you requesting like this?

949
01:19:41,108 --> 01:19:43,655
If you request like this,
I will help right away.

950
01:19:43,775 --> 01:19:47,427
I mean, actually, I plan to go..

951
01:19:47,547 --> 01:19:49,279
..for an Europe tour
with my wife next year.

952
01:19:49,399 --> 01:19:52,013
But, by getting involved
in all this if I..

953
01:19:52,133 --> 01:19:55,153
- Ask him to stop laughing.
- Panther.

954
01:19:59,934 --> 01:20:01,093
Good luck, brother.

955
01:20:11,134 --> 01:20:12,716
What happened? All well?

956
01:20:15,233 --> 01:20:16,947
Samir and his family need
to be taken to India.

957
01:20:17,067 --> 01:20:19,514
And if their tickets
are not done secretly..

958
01:20:22,542 --> 01:20:24,542
If Jahangir sir would have
been there then today..

959
01:20:29,426 --> 01:20:30,741
I don't know what to do.

960
01:20:31,404 --> 01:20:34,891
Don't worry. I have a friend
here at Al Dera named Shahida.

961
01:20:35,452 --> 01:20:36,788
She works at the airport.

962
01:20:36,921 --> 01:20:39,608
I am sure she will definitely
book the tickets for India.

963
01:20:40,845 --> 01:20:41,868
Wait.

964
01:20:56,975 --> 01:20:58,157
Thanks, Shahida.

965
01:20:59,649 --> 01:21:01,372
Once their fake
passports are ready..

966
01:21:01,492 --> 01:21:04,441
..we have to send their
passport, their details to Shahida.

967
01:21:05,729 --> 01:21:06,801
Thanks, Zia.

968
01:21:09,953 --> 01:21:10,997
Panther.

969
01:21:16,775 --> 01:21:17,775
Thank you.

970
01:21:18,776 --> 01:21:20,357
Till today, I had expressed..

971
01:21:22,354 --> 01:21:23,899
..my demands only to my dad.

972
01:21:24,660 --> 01:21:27,317
Today, I demanded something from
someone else, for the first time.

973
01:21:29,664 --> 01:21:31,618
Thank you for
fulfilling my demands..

974
01:21:31,738 --> 01:21:34,943
..for not letting me be
lonely and for everything else.

975
01:21:35,417 --> 01:21:36,417
Thanks.

976
01:21:53,236 --> 01:21:54,516
How far has the work progressed?

977
01:21:55,951 --> 01:21:57,601
Unlike you,
I don't work with bullets..

978
01:21:57,721 --> 01:21:59,373
..but with my brain.
It'll take time.

979
01:21:59,800 --> 01:22:01,008
Spider, we are short of time.

980
01:22:01,128 --> 01:22:03,143
Then do one thing. Let me go.
Bring someone else.

981
01:22:03,341 --> 01:22:04,827
Anyway,
I won't be able to return to my..

982
01:22:05,225 --> 01:22:06,645
..country after doing
all this illegal work.

983
01:22:07,553 --> 01:22:10,616
Spider, there is no use returning to
our country if we don't accomplish this.

984
01:22:11,015 --> 01:22:12,118
What do you want to say?

985
01:22:13,004 --> 01:22:14,549
If we can't take them
back to our country..

986
01:22:14,669 --> 01:22:16,308
..then we won't be able
to stop the blasts.

987
01:22:16,981 --> 01:22:18,779
And if we cannot stop the blasts..

988
01:22:21,980 --> 01:22:24,500
..we won't be able to face anyone
after returning to our country.

989
01:22:37,932 --> 01:22:39,158
- Sir.
- Yes, Panther.

990
01:22:39,278 --> 01:22:40,876
We are sending Samir Hassan and
his family to Delhi today itself.

991
01:22:40,996 --> 01:22:41,684
Fantastic.

992
01:22:41,804 --> 01:22:44,747
But, sir,
we couldn't trace Aman Hassan yet.

993
01:22:46,580 --> 01:22:47,921
- Panther.
- Sir.

994
01:22:48,041 --> 01:22:51,361
As per video threat, they'll
do a blast at Kolkata tomorrow.

995
01:22:51,512 --> 01:22:55,555
And ministry has decided to release
Yakub in order to stop that.

996
01:22:58,105 --> 01:23:00,421
Don't worry, sir.
Panther is on duty.

997
01:23:01,524 --> 01:23:03,220
- I know.
- Thanks.

998
01:23:34,344 --> 01:23:38,052
Sir, Why are there so
many people from embassy?

999
01:23:38,635 --> 01:23:41,314
They have information
that few passengers..

1000
01:23:41,652 --> 01:23:43,927
..are trying to go to
India on fake passport.

1001
01:23:44,137 --> 01:23:45,792
Okay. On which flight?

1002
01:23:54,684 --> 01:23:55,752
Yes, Shahida?

1003
01:24:02,476 --> 01:24:04,271
Okay, thanks for the
information, Shahida.

1004
01:24:05,703 --> 01:24:06,798
All okay, Zia?

1005
01:24:06,918 --> 01:24:09,679
Shafiq Reza and the embassy guards
have reached the airport before us.

1006
01:24:10,502 --> 01:24:13,369
We can't move Samir and his
family from Al Dera airport.

1007
01:24:13,839 --> 01:24:16,927
I knew,
being with him will create a..

1008
01:24:17,047 --> 01:24:18,633
You can't work with
your limbs always.

1009
01:24:18,753 --> 01:24:20,248
At times,
you should also use your brain.

1010
01:24:20,368 --> 01:24:22,276
They do a government
job, They are not..

1011
01:24:22,396 --> 01:24:23,396
Shut up, Spider.

1012
01:24:26,813 --> 01:24:27,948
Look at him.

1013
01:24:40,247 --> 01:24:41,348
Zia.

1014
01:24:41,891 --> 01:24:43,851
Is there any flight for
Delhi from Bidrid airport?

1015
01:24:45,318 --> 01:24:47,117
Yes, there is one in
a couple of hours.

1016
01:24:47,837 --> 01:24:49,409
That means, we still have time.

1017
01:24:49,725 --> 01:24:53,057
Call up Shahida and ask her to book
their tickets from that airport.

1018
01:24:53,204 --> 01:24:55,041
Also inform her that their names
shouldn't reflect on the system.

1019
01:24:55,161 --> 01:24:57,141
Ensure that just the PNR
is reflected on the system.

1020
01:24:57,261 --> 01:24:58,371
- Okay.
- And, yes..

1021
01:24:58,592 --> 01:25:01,614
She shouldn't cancel the
tickets from Al Dera to Delhi.

1022
01:25:02,283 --> 01:25:03,586
- Alright.
- Just speak to her.

1023
01:25:26,060 --> 01:25:27,216
They are embassy guards.

1024
01:25:28,658 --> 01:25:31,029
That means, since they didn't
find Samir and his family at..

1025
01:25:31,149 --> 01:25:33,911
..Al Dera airport, they are looking
for them at all the check posts.

1026
01:25:46,537 --> 01:25:48,332
Zia, is there any other
way to reach Bidrid..

1027
01:25:48,452 --> 01:25:50,170
..airport avoiding all
these check posts?

1028
01:25:53,178 --> 01:25:55,708
No. There's no other way, Panther.

1029
01:26:03,119 --> 01:26:04,359
There's no other way..

1030
01:26:05,028 --> 01:26:07,425
..but there's an idea.
Let me try, Zia.

1031
01:26:44,804 --> 01:26:46,658
I have a Europe tour ahead.

1032
01:27:03,004 --> 01:27:04,487
Spider, are you okay?

1033
01:27:12,745 --> 01:27:14,051
- Water?
- Yes.

1034
01:28:00,850 --> 01:28:02,433
Congratulations, Spider.

1035
01:28:03,938 --> 01:28:05,964
Finally,
you are returning to your country.

1036
01:28:07,746 --> 01:28:09,313
At least, now I deserve a thanks.

1037
01:28:10,597 --> 01:28:13,647
No, first let me safely reach
Delhi then I will say thanks.

1038
01:28:14,090 --> 01:28:16,050
You won't get me immediately
once you reach Delhi.

1039
01:28:18,286 --> 01:28:22,093
It's your responsibility to ensure that
Samir and his family reach Delhi safely.

1040
01:28:22,477 --> 01:28:23,507
What the..

1041
01:28:24,139 --> 01:28:26,712
No, no, I am not crazy like you.

1042
01:28:27,416 --> 01:28:30,504
No, in the middle of the
road if I am.. Then my heart..

1043
01:28:33,493 --> 01:28:36,599
Not the middle of the road,
Spider, middle of the sky.

1044
01:28:36,719 --> 01:28:38,426
And many things can happen
in the middle of the sky.

1045
01:28:38,546 --> 01:28:40,762
Flight can crash in the middle
of the sky, you may die.

1046
01:28:41,076 --> 01:28:43,196
No, no. I don't like the
reference of death..

1047
01:28:44,306 --> 01:28:47,690
..besides, I have to take my
wife for a Europe tour..

1048
01:28:48,232 --> 01:28:50,802
If I knew that you will leave
me at middle of the road..

1049
01:28:50,922 --> 01:28:53,349
..like this then I would
not have helped..

1050
01:28:55,931 --> 01:28:58,054
I mean, I wouldn't
have helped you at all.

1051
01:29:03,088 --> 01:29:05,596
- Okay, where are you going?
- Tadzhikistan.

1052
01:29:06,277 --> 01:29:07,445
- Tad..
- Yes.

1053
01:29:09,349 --> 01:29:11,635
Spider, your tracking
system has failed this time.

1054
01:29:13,477 --> 01:29:16,693
As per Shahida's information, Aman
might have gone to Tadzhikistan.

1055
01:29:17,053 --> 01:29:19,253
So, I have to go to Tadzhikistan
as soon as possible.

1056
01:29:19,992 --> 01:29:21,699
And, if I am unable..

1057
01:29:21,779 --> 01:29:24,561
..to bring Aman back to our country
from Kyrgyzstan within 24 hours..

1058
01:29:24,641 --> 01:29:26,686
..then there may be one more blast.

1059
01:29:28,654 --> 01:29:30,391
I hope you understand, Spider.

1060
01:29:33,396 --> 01:29:34,818
Listen, Panther!

1061
01:29:41,289 --> 01:29:43,437
I understand that
the method of our work..

1062
01:29:43,517 --> 01:29:46,869
..is different,
so our ways are different too.

1063
01:29:48,290 --> 01:29:51,331
But we both work
for our country, don't we?

1064
01:29:53,148 --> 01:29:56,194
Today, let me say it
once more for our country.

1065
01:29:57,544 --> 01:29:59,479
If our heart beats, then..

1066
01:30:01,120 --> 01:30:02,545
Jai Hind!

1067
01:30:02,625 --> 01:30:05,826
- If we breathe, then..
- Jai Hind!

1068
01:30:05,906 --> 01:30:07,435
If we bleed, then..

1069
01:30:08,551 --> 01:30:09,788
Jai Hind!

1070
01:30:16,946 --> 01:30:19,148
All the best, Spider. Take care.

1071
01:30:19,228 --> 01:30:20,653
Thank you.

1072
01:30:24,088 --> 01:30:25,553
Goodbye.

1073
01:30:34,516 --> 01:30:36,716
Panther, boarding passes. Let's go.

1074
01:30:37,148 --> 01:30:38,393
Yes, come.

1075
01:31:39,513 --> 01:31:42,149
Stop. Stop the music.

1076
01:31:42,767 --> 01:31:45,569
- I think something has happened?
- Hey, what's happening?

1077
01:31:47,146 --> 01:31:48,851
Why aren't you listening?

1078
01:31:49,329 --> 01:31:51,235
I am telling you to dance.

1079
01:31:51,729 --> 01:31:53,478
Listen, no dance, no money.

1080
01:31:53,558 --> 01:31:55,076
Do you understand?

1081
01:31:57,038 --> 01:31:58,314
Dance!

1082
01:32:02,427 --> 01:32:05,492
Over. Audition over.

1083
01:32:06,166 --> 01:32:08,741
Those of you are selected..

1084
01:32:08,821 --> 01:32:11,606
..will be uploaded on the website
in the evening. Now go.

1085
01:32:11,686 --> 01:32:14,660
Go. Get away from here please.

1086
01:32:15,028 --> 01:32:17,566
Why are you two still here?

1087
01:32:17,945 --> 01:32:19,917
I want them alone. Go, go.

1088
01:32:20,700 --> 01:32:21,909
Go!

1089
01:32:22,424 --> 01:32:23,856
Come on, let's go.

1090
01:32:29,099 --> 01:32:30,520
Sir.

1091
01:32:35,875 --> 01:32:37,816
She is Zia.

1092
01:32:38,533 --> 01:32:39,882
Good afternoon, madam.

1093
01:32:40,443 --> 01:32:44,760
Zia, he is our most
interesting RAW agent, Jhunjhun.

1094
01:32:44,840 --> 01:32:46,310
Why are you embarrassing me, sir?

1095
01:32:46,590 --> 01:32:48,373
Do you know, madam,
since childhood I wanted to become..

1096
01:32:48,453 --> 01:32:49,987
..a backup dancer
in Mumbai film industry.

1097
01:32:50,434 --> 01:32:53,251
But everything changed once
I encountered Panther sir.

1098
01:32:53,537 --> 01:32:55,445
Okay, Jhunjhun, do you
have any new information?

1099
01:32:55,525 --> 01:32:58,067
I have, sir.
In a resort near near by..

1100
01:32:58,573 --> 01:33:01,551
..few people from
our neighboring country have arrived.

1101
01:33:01,631 --> 01:33:04,554
And yesterday one more person
from Al Dera has joined them.

1102
01:33:04,634 --> 01:33:05,993
Do you have any information
about this new person?

1103
01:33:06,404 --> 01:33:07,695
I have, sir.

1104
01:33:09,904 --> 01:33:11,270
Mizba Haque.

1105
01:33:14,429 --> 01:33:15,629
Yes.

1106
01:33:16,363 --> 01:33:17,413
He is Aman Hassan.

1107
01:33:17,493 --> 01:33:19,891
- Aman? - Panther,
what should be our next step?

1108
01:33:22,147 --> 01:33:24,614
- Going to the resort and relaxing.
- No, sir. That is not possible.

1109
01:33:24,694 --> 01:33:26,404
They are not allowing
people from outside.

1110
01:33:27,116 --> 01:33:28,189
Jhunjhun..

1111
01:33:29,055 --> 01:33:31,198
..you are our most interesting..

1112
01:33:32,464 --> 01:33:33,536
..RAW agent.

1113
01:33:36,012 --> 01:33:38,212
Your audition results
will be out today evening, right?

1114
01:33:42,531 --> 01:33:46,870
Come on, baby. Come on. Wow!

1115
01:33:46,950 --> 01:33:48,857
Come pretty, baby, come on.

1116
01:33:48,937 --> 01:33:51,896
Come on. Come.

1117
01:33:52,746 --> 01:33:55,196
What a nice place!

1118
01:33:55,524 --> 01:33:58,244
Come on. Come on. Come on, baby.

1119
01:34:18,875 --> 01:34:20,137
Did anything happen, Panther?

1120
01:34:23,430 --> 01:34:27,344
Such a tight security can't be
only for Aman Hassan.

1121
01:34:28,396 --> 01:34:30,546
There's definitely
something else too.

1122
01:34:31,252 --> 01:34:32,997
Sir, what are you suspecting?

1123
01:34:33,981 --> 01:34:38,433
Hizbul Al-Qaida's chief,
Yakub Habibi is still in prison.

1124
01:34:39,351 --> 01:34:42,501
My sixth sense tells me
that Aman Hassan..

1125
01:34:42,915 --> 01:34:46,396
..has definitely come here to meet
a bigger leader of Hizbul Al-Qaida.

1126
01:34:49,740 --> 01:34:53,917
If my guess is right,
then we will be able..

1127
01:34:55,263 --> 01:34:58,198
..to take one more person from here
along with Aman Hassan.

1128
01:35:01,112 --> 01:35:02,275
Just a second.

1129
01:35:10,158 --> 01:35:11,888
- Yes, Panther.
- Sir.

1130
01:35:11,968 --> 01:35:14,637
Sir, do you accept buy
one get one free offer?

1131
01:35:15,280 --> 01:35:18,055
I do. It depends on how
exciting that offer is.

1132
01:35:18,135 --> 01:35:20,611
I exactly don't know how
exciting, sir. But..

1133
01:35:21,503 --> 01:35:24,306
..someone very very big.

1134
01:35:24,611 --> 01:35:27,741
If you give me confirmation,
I will talk to the ministry.

1135
01:35:28,125 --> 01:35:30,299
The release order of Yakub
is almost ready.

1136
01:35:30,762 --> 01:35:33,791
Only you are able to null
and void this order.

1137
01:35:33,871 --> 01:35:35,259
Sir, rest assured..

1138
01:35:35,983 --> 01:35:38,272
..since I've already entered
the serpent's hole..

1139
01:35:38,352 --> 01:35:41,735
..then no matter how venomous
the serpent is..

1140
01:35:42,350 --> 01:35:44,759
..I will return to my country
only when I catch him.

1141
01:35:48,047 --> 01:35:49,575
Greetings, sir.

1142
01:35:53,245 --> 01:35:55,195
Greetings!

1143
01:35:56,152 --> 01:35:59,202
Sir, our boys are ready
to explode Kolkata.

1144
01:35:59,739 --> 01:36:01,585
We are just waiting
for your orders.

1145
01:36:06,548 --> 01:36:08,886
The one who couldn't
kill his own people..

1146
01:36:10,168 --> 01:36:12,360
..will explode Kolkata?

1147
01:36:14,825 --> 01:36:18,905
Your mom, your brother..

1148
01:36:19,744 --> 01:36:21,742
..your brother's wife..

1149
01:36:23,212 --> 01:36:24,919
..are still alive.

1150
01:36:26,219 --> 01:36:29,150
They are in the custody
of Indian government.

1151
01:36:30,035 --> 01:36:34,014
And they must have extracted all
the information from them by now.

1152
01:36:37,303 --> 01:36:39,036
Sir, it will be of no use.

1153
01:36:40,509 --> 01:36:44,263
No one except me
knows about this plan.

1154
01:36:49,135 --> 01:36:50,836
You can rest assured.

1155
01:36:50,916 --> 01:36:53,837
My right hand doesn't
even trust my left hand.

1156
01:37:01,374 --> 01:37:05,844
'We want to give a last warning
to the government of India.'

1157
01:37:06,164 --> 01:37:11,348
'Out of the 72 hours,
48 hours are about to get over.'

1158
01:37:13,289 --> 01:37:18,359
'If our capable
Jihadi Yakub Habibi is..'

1159
01:37:18,774 --> 01:37:22,161
'..not sent across in a special
chopper by 8 am tomorrow, then..'

1160
01:37:23,551 --> 01:37:25,560
'..before the sunset tomorrow..'

1161
01:37:25,975 --> 01:37:28,941
'..Kolkata will be destroyed.'

1162
01:37:29,021 --> 01:37:31,364
We have to release Yakub
tomorrow morning at 6.

1163
01:37:31,444 --> 01:37:33,272
Please don't give this
release order now.

1164
01:37:33,352 --> 01:37:35,308
Try to understand my problem.

1165
01:37:35,388 --> 01:37:39,394
If, somehow, the blast takes
place tomorrow you know well..

1166
01:37:39,474 --> 01:37:41,147
..what a dangerous
situation that will be.

1167
01:37:46,118 --> 01:37:48,048
Start the release procedures of Yakub.

1168
01:43:42,570 --> 01:43:43,655
Zia.

1169
01:43:47,408 --> 01:43:48,860
Shoot, Zia! Shoot, Zia!

1170
01:43:48,940 --> 01:43:50,132
I can't.

1171
01:43:52,346 --> 01:43:54,852
- Shoot, Zia! Zia, shoot!
- I can't.

1172
01:43:57,143 --> 01:43:58,699
Zia, shoot! Zia, please.

1173
01:43:59,219 --> 01:44:00,676
Zia, shoot!

1174
01:44:06,222 --> 01:44:08,970
Hold it. Give me the gun.

1175
01:44:54,068 --> 01:44:55,099
Sir.

1176
01:44:55,480 --> 01:44:57,500
It will be morning by the time
you cross the border.

1177
01:44:57,580 --> 01:45:01,261
And the documents required to cross
the border are in this envelop.

1178
01:45:01,341 --> 01:45:03,473
And even then
if you face any problem..

1179
01:45:05,088 --> 01:45:06,777
If there is a problem,
there is a solution too.

1180
01:45:06,857 --> 01:45:08,182
Yes, sir.

1181
01:45:25,187 --> 01:45:26,617
- Yes, Panther.
- Sir.

1182
01:45:27,121 --> 01:45:28,614
I am returning to the border
with Aman Hassan.

1183
01:45:28,694 --> 01:45:31,424
- Only Aman?
- No, sir. There's one more person.

1184
01:45:31,877 --> 01:45:32,792
Who?

1185
01:45:32,872 --> 01:45:34,607
The deputy chief of Hizbul Al-Qaida..

1186
01:45:35,627 --> 01:45:37,283
- ..Afzal Faridi.
- What?

1187
01:45:37,363 --> 01:45:38,665
Yes, sir.

1188
01:45:38,745 --> 01:45:41,408
Panther, if you can enter India
along with Afzal..

1189
01:45:41,865 --> 01:45:43,386
..then global platform
will be compelled..

1190
01:45:43,466 --> 01:45:45,343
..to think about RAW
in a different way.

1191
01:45:45,822 --> 01:45:49,572
But one thing. Yakub will be released
by 8 in the morning.

1192
01:45:49,652 --> 01:45:51,699
You have to enter India before that.

1193
01:45:52,277 --> 01:45:55,325
At any cost. Your time starts now.

1194
01:45:55,405 --> 01:45:56,850
Right, sir.

1195
01:46:06,936 --> 01:46:08,465
Give me your phone please.

1196
01:46:09,786 --> 01:46:11,618
- Destroy both.
- Yes, sir.

1197
01:46:14,697 --> 01:46:17,322
So that Kyrgyzstan police
cannot track us.

1198
01:46:19,737 --> 01:46:22,845

1202
01:46:53,678 --> 01:46:56,263
Sir, CCTV footage is ready.

1203
01:46:56,343 --> 01:46:58,237
- Did you send it to the border?
- Yes, sir.

1204
01:46:58,317 --> 01:46:59,400
Alert at the border.

1205
01:46:59,480 --> 01:47:02,153
Whoever has done this
shouldn't get to cross the border.

1206
01:47:02,233 --> 01:47:03,938
- Come on move.
- Okay, sir.

1207
01:48:17,135 --> 01:48:18,971

1209
01:48:21,323 --> 01:48:23,006
Show your passport.

1210
01:48:24,286 --> 01:48:26,444
What is in there? Come on, show me.

1211
01:48:26,524 --> 01:48:28,524
What is there inside? Show me.

1212
01:48:47,366 --> 01:48:49,047
Get down.

1213
01:48:49,697 --> 01:48:52,103
- What happened?
- This is border!!

1214
01:48:57,827 --> 01:49:00,065
Panther, where are you?

1215
01:49:19,574 --> 01:49:21,089
What is there in the truck?

1216
01:49:21,169 --> 01:49:23,104
- Sir, there are Walnuts.
- Show it.

1217
01:49:24,108 --> 01:49:25,728
Sir, please let us go.
There are just Walnuts in there.

1218
01:49:25,808 --> 01:49:27,594
Will you show
or do I seize your truck?

1219
01:49:27,674 --> 01:49:28,884
Come on.

1220
01:49:37,080 --> 01:49:39,203
- Check throughly.
- Yes, sir.

1221
01:50:53,568 --> 01:50:56,403
- Didn't find anything, sir.
- Okay.

1222
01:50:57,176 --> 01:50:58,230
Let's go.

1223
01:50:58,685 --> 01:51:01,589
Stop. You check down the truck.

1224
01:51:02,010 --> 01:51:03,509
Yes, sir.

1225
01:51:50,478 --> 01:51:51,724
Sir, there's nothing down there.

1226
01:51:52,197 --> 01:51:53,577
- Okay.
- Okay sir, we are leaving.

1227
01:51:53,657 --> 01:51:54,737
- Go.
- Come.

1228
01:52:43,631 --> 01:52:45,711
- Yes.
- Sir! Panther here.

1229
01:52:46,380 --> 01:52:49,473
Sir, have the machine used
to remove oil from Walnut ready.

1230
01:52:50,843 --> 01:52:52,581
We have to remove a lot of oil.

1231
01:52:53,748 --> 01:52:57,323
Yes. How did you
manage to do it, Panther?

1232
01:52:59,016 --> 01:53:00,101
Sir, when we reached at
the border we noticed that..

1233
01:53:00,181 --> 01:53:02,029
..all the vehicles are being
checked thoroughly.

1234
01:53:02,109 --> 01:53:03,557
The passengers of the bus
ahead of us were asked to get down..

1235
01:53:03,637 --> 01:53:05,855
..and the entire bus
was checked thoroughly.

1236
01:53:05,935 --> 01:53:08,014
Right then I thought of a plan.

1237
01:53:09,168 --> 01:53:11,448
I called uncle Rahim,
the driver of the bus..

1238
01:53:12,398 --> 01:53:16,258
..and told him about the issue
and requested him.

1239
01:53:18,928 --> 01:53:21,527
Then with the help of uncle Rahim..

1240
01:53:21,607 --> 01:53:22,983
..I entered India along
with Aman Hassan..

1241
01:53:23,063 --> 01:53:26,383
..and Afzal Faridi
crossing the border.

1242
01:53:41,553 --> 01:53:43,704
- 'Thank you, uncle.
- What is there to thank?'

1243
01:53:43,784 --> 01:53:45,827
'I can give my life for my country.'

1244
01:53:50,481 --> 01:53:52,064
Yes.

1245
01:54:03,109 --> 01:54:04,780
Go!

1246
01:54:05,071 --> 01:54:07,225
Get him out of the chopper.
