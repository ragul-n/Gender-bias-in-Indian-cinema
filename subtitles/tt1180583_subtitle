1
00:01:46,472 --> 00:01:47,632
What a beautiful feeling, man!

2
00:01:48,974 --> 00:01:51,738
Surya, guess how many girls you
can get with your talent!

3
00:01:52,177 --> 00:01:53,201
You're wasting that chance!

4
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:09,082
Let's go by car.

5
00:03:09,421 --> 00:03:10,479
It is near only.
Never mind.

6
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:33,402
Why you never had this shaved?

7
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:35,205
It is just nice.

8
00:03:37,116 --> 00:03:38,140
When they will be back?

9
00:03:39,151 --> 00:03:40,311
They will be back soon.

10
00:03:42,087 --> 00:03:43,714
I'll go and take bath.

11
00:03:45,891 --> 00:03:46,915
Eat your medicine..

12
00:03:48,927 --> 00:03:49,791
Letchumi!

13
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:53,121
I'll bring him up to my room.
- No, let him sleep here.

14
00:05:04,703 --> 00:05:08,400
I'm going to die!
- Don't talk like that!

15
00:05:08,907 --> 00:05:10,602
We will call the doctor.
Everything will be fine.

16
00:05:10,742 --> 00:05:11,606
Come!

17
00:05:14,313 --> 00:05:15,280
Shreya!

18
00:05:19,151 --> 00:05:20,049
Leave it!

19
00:05:20,185 --> 00:05:20,981
What had happen?

20
00:05:23,222 --> 00:05:24,849
Ask the doctor to come.
- Careful!

21
00:05:33,966 --> 00:05:37,026
Surya, Surya.

22
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,402
We need to call Surya.

23
00:06:28,453 --> 00:06:30,444
Don't go anywhere!
Be with me.

24
00:06:34,893 --> 00:06:35,757
No, it's impossible!

25
00:06:35,894 --> 00:06:37,486
His blood cells are burst in
the main artery.

26
00:06:37,629 --> 00:06:38,561
His pressure will increase then.

27
00:06:38,864 --> 00:06:40,354
He will face more blood loss.

28
00:06:41,433 --> 00:06:42,627
We can't do anything after this.

29
00:06:42,768 --> 00:06:44,929
I've told you earlier that
this will happen, Mrs. Krishnan.

30
00:06:45,237 --> 00:06:46,636
I've gave him medicine.

31
00:06:46,838 --> 00:06:48,430
You can start to inform everyone.

32
00:06:49,107 --> 00:06:50,074
Let him sleep.

33
00:07:16,902 --> 00:07:18,164
What he's looking at?

34
00:07:30,082 --> 00:07:30,844
There's no pulse.

35
00:07:35,387 --> 00:07:37,116
Doctor, please check him!

36
00:10:59,057 --> 00:11:00,422
I thought you'll be fine.

37
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:03,056
I thought nothing bad will happen to you.
That's why I came to this mission.

38
00:11:18,243 --> 00:11:20,108
I want to see you.
I want to see you now.

39
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:23,007
Where are you, dad?
Are you with me?

40
00:11:23,582 --> 00:11:24,674
Can you see me?

41
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,744
You are with me now, dad.

42
00:12:02,954 --> 00:12:04,012
How is mum now?

43
00:12:06,858 --> 00:12:07,984
Are you staying brave, mom?

44
00:12:13,598 --> 00:12:15,896
That day, we were sitting and
talking all our past stories.

45
00:12:16,868 --> 00:12:18,392
You were telling about
your love story.

46
00:12:19,404 --> 00:12:21,804
About how dad and you met
in the first place.

47
00:12:24,543 --> 00:12:25,874
I don't know, mom.
Why?

48
00:12:27,212 --> 00:12:29,112
Your dad is from Uttampalam
and I'm from Madurai.

49
00:12:30,348 --> 00:12:31,940
We met in Madras Christian College.

50
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:33,816
When we came to study.

51
00:12:39,224 --> 00:12:40,657
He loved me madly.

52
00:12:46,464 --> 00:12:48,398
Our life begun because of that love.

53
00:12:50,502 --> 00:12:54,336
Because of that love,
you, Shreya and everything happen.

54
00:13:10,589 --> 00:13:11,851
Krishnan, what are you doing here?

55
00:13:12,457 --> 00:13:14,687
You won't come to library, what!
- One minute, please!

56
00:13:17,829 --> 00:13:20,229
Malini, Malini.

57
00:13:20,832 --> 00:13:22,060
I came behind that girl.

58
00:13:23,501 --> 00:13:24,866
I like that girl very much.

59
00:13:25,804 --> 00:13:28,329
Will you please tell her that?

60
00:13:28,473 --> 00:13:29,337
Later.

61
00:13:29,474 --> 00:13:30,634
What are you saying, Krishnan?

62
00:13:31,409 --> 00:13:32,876
This is love.
You understand, right?

63
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:42,078
Do you know, Krishnan?
He's doing Bsc. in Chemistry.

64
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,252
I don't knoW.

65
00:13:44,289 --> 00:13:46,621
He asked me to tell you that
he likes you very much.

66
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:48,255
Don't get me wrong.

67
00:13:51,162 --> 00:13:52,151
One minute, Malini.

68
00:13:52,297 --> 00:13:55,630
Krishnan from Bsc. Chemistry
doing final year said he likes you.

69
00:13:56,067 --> 00:13:57,034
What is this, Malini?

70
00:13:59,104 --> 00:14:00,765
Krishnan said he likes you.

71
00:14:01,806 --> 00:14:02,932
Guess how angry I should be!

72
00:14:03,608 --> 00:14:07,203
Where ever I go,
people will tell me that.

73
00:14:07,545 --> 00:14:08,603
For the whole week.

74
00:14:09,981 --> 00:14:11,539
I've never seen him before that time.

75
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:14,415
Dad, whenever we talks about you,

76
00:14:14,819 --> 00:14:16,377
I have seen the love in mum's eyes.

77
00:14:16,521 --> 00:14:18,352
Who is Krishnan?
Bsc. Chemistry doing final year.

78
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:22,017
Krishnan, right?
You wait here. Don't go anywhere.

79
00:14:27,732 --> 00:14:30,394
But when the first time I met him,
my anger flew away.

80
00:14:31,536 --> 00:14:33,595
Your dad was so handsome.

81
00:14:34,606 --> 00:14:36,233
He's still handsome.
I will tell.

82
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:42,580
In one second.

83
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:42,636
In one second.

84
00:14:46,951 --> 00:14:48,680
I need to tell you this.

85
00:14:49,721 --> 00:14:51,552
You are so beautiful!

86
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:55,585
No one here must have seen..

87
00:14:57,929 --> 00:14:59,294
A beauty like this before.

88
00:20:05,236 --> 00:20:05,269
Your love is my inspiration in life.

89
00:20:05,269 --> 00:20:08,170
Your love is my inspiration in life.

90
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:09,898
Inspiration to everything.

91
00:20:17,148 --> 00:20:18,809
He's like you.
Exactly.

92
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:20,708
I don't have a single cent
with me.

93
00:20:20,852 --> 00:20:22,877
But I'm the most happiest man
on earth.

94
00:20:23,688 --> 00:20:24,780
Are you happy?

95
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:27,416
Now onwards,
everything is for him.

96
00:20:28,192 --> 00:20:29,750
Everything surround him
must be beautiful.

97
00:20:30,461 --> 00:20:31,928
He must always be happy.

98
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:34,325
I don't know what is written
for him in life.

99
00:20:34,532 --> 00:20:38,263
But if anything is written wrongly,
I'll rewrite it.

100
00:20:49,013 --> 00:20:50,776
Do you remember when
Shreya was born?

101
00:20:53,151 --> 00:20:54,846
Do you remember our home
in Calicut?

102
00:20:55,386 --> 00:20:56,853
Now, I can remember everything.

103
00:20:59,524 --> 00:21:01,116
Feel like want to be younger again.

104
00:21:01,859 --> 00:21:03,383
Our small bedroom.

105
00:21:07,965 --> 00:21:09,159
We did not have money.

106
00:21:32,256 --> 00:21:32,984
It's nothing.

107
00:21:34,225 --> 00:21:35,419
Never leave dad's hand, ok.

108
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,424
That day,

109
00:21:36,761 --> 00:21:39,628
I told to myself that I'll never
leave your hand.

110
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:01,343
When we shifted from
Kerala to Madras,

111
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:03,977
You didn't follow me by train
but followed your dad by lorry.

112
00:22:04,122 --> 00:22:04,986
I remember.

113
00:22:06,424 --> 00:22:07,550
Dad is everything to you.

114
00:22:09,393 --> 00:22:10,485
Are you ok, Mani?

115
00:22:10,795 --> 00:22:12,387
I'm ok, sir.
- You take rest.

116
00:22:13,464 --> 00:22:14,658
My son is in this lorry.

117
00:22:15,266 --> 00:22:18,235
I'm not taking the risk.
You stop the lorry.

118
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:20,862
No problem, sir.
- Stop, Mani.

119
00:22:33,317 --> 00:22:34,750
You are my hero, dad.

120
00:22:51,769 --> 00:22:53,498
You have taught me a lot.

121
00:22:54,906 --> 00:22:56,100
If you hold it like this,
you'll get the out pick.

122
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,502
I remember everything now.

123
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:00,636
Your nice face.

124
00:23:01,179 --> 00:23:05,013
Your body, your voice.
You are my everything.

125
00:23:08,252 --> 00:23:09,617
You gave me so much of freedom.

126
00:23:10,821 --> 00:23:12,379
You gave everything that I need.

127
00:23:13,491 --> 00:23:14,981
I can't never forget that, dad.

128
00:23:23,034 --> 00:23:26,834
The music inside me is
also because of you.

129
00:24:09,247 --> 00:24:11,647
Sing one Tamil song with
this same feel.

130
00:24:11,782 --> 00:24:12,806
Really?
- Yes.

131
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:57,620
You'll always be with mum.

132
00:24:58,462 --> 00:24:59,986
You loved her madly.

133
00:25:00,431 --> 00:25:01,193
Mum too.

134
00:25:03,634 --> 00:25:06,034
I too wanted to love a girl
like that.

135
00:25:06,637 --> 00:25:07,467
I still remember.

136
00:25:20,017 --> 00:25:21,211
You are saying you'll pass.

137
00:25:22,286 --> 00:25:23,275
We will see.

138
00:25:27,158 --> 00:25:28,785
You don't smoke, right?

139
00:25:30,094 --> 00:25:31,561
No, dad.
I've never touched it.

140
00:25:35,833 --> 00:25:37,767
Why are you smoking then?

141
00:25:38,869 --> 00:25:40,632
This has become a habit since
college time.

142
00:25:40,771 --> 00:25:41,999
I can't let it go.
Go.

143
00:25:44,575 --> 00:25:45,439
What exam?

144
00:25:48,879 --> 00:25:51,370
I saw you talking to some girls
on the street.

145
00:25:52,249 --> 00:25:53,716
Don't do it!
- I asked for question paper..

146
00:25:53,851 --> 00:25:56,217
Your house may be small
but it's nice.

147
00:25:56,354 --> 00:25:58,185
Bring them home and talk.

148
00:26:02,026 --> 00:26:03,118
Looks like you have brought
them all!

149
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:04,420
Ya, you are the one told, right?

150
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:12,964
Your dad is very cool.

151
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:17,166
It's friendship.
Aarthi is just my friend.

152
00:26:17,441 --> 00:26:18,772
But I'll ask her to tie
'Rakhi' for you.

153
00:26:19,176 --> 00:26:19,938
Stop!

154
00:26:21,512 --> 00:26:23,810
If you are Aarthi's friend,
does that mean you are a big shot?

155
00:26:23,948 --> 00:26:25,313
Are you walking around proudly?

156
00:26:26,117 --> 00:26:27,846
Will she only talks to you?

157
00:26:29,053 --> 00:26:31,851
I don't want to see you
talking to her anymore.

158
00:26:32,189 --> 00:26:34,589
Go from here.
Go.

159
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:41,361
I want to beat him at Ieast once.

160
00:26:42,566 --> 00:26:45,194
You saw his body, right?
He's taller than you some more.

161
00:26:45,336 --> 00:26:46,428
You will be gone then!

162
00:26:46,971 --> 00:26:48,700
We can even escape after
we beat him.

163
00:26:48,839 --> 00:26:50,602
We only have bicycle.
He has Yamaha bike.

164
00:27:03,687 --> 00:27:04,984
I should have hit his left hand and
punched him.

165
00:27:06,123 --> 00:27:07,385
Punch his face and get down.

166
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:10,757
Block him and...

167
00:27:22,606 --> 00:27:23,300
What is this?

168
00:27:23,574 --> 00:27:24,506
What happened?

169
00:27:26,844 --> 00:27:28,436
Your girlfriend didn't do this, right?

170
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:30,639
No, dad.

171
00:27:31,949 --> 00:27:32,779
What is the problem?

172
00:27:33,617 --> 00:27:34,743
I talked to a girl.

173
00:27:35,352 --> 00:27:37,377
She is his, it seems.
He hit me.

174
00:27:37,655 --> 00:27:38,781
Did you hit him back?

175
00:27:39,156 --> 00:27:41,317
He's elder than me, dad.
- so?

176
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:43,760
You have worked out this, right!

177
00:27:44,261 --> 00:27:45,159
For what?

178
00:27:49,066 --> 00:27:50,533
You are my hero, dad.

179
00:27:53,637 --> 00:27:54,433
Please don't do it, buddy!

180
00:27:58,609 --> 00:27:59,871
Just one hit.
- Surya!

181
00:28:00,478 --> 00:28:02,036
Don't know what is going
to happen!

182
00:28:03,314 --> 00:28:04,178
What?

183
00:28:09,019 --> 00:28:10,987
He hit me the other day.
That's why I hit him back.

184
00:28:11,121 --> 00:28:12,748
It's between me and him.
- Move aside!

185
00:28:14,625 --> 00:28:15,421
How dare you!

186
00:28:15,926 --> 00:28:18,759
Come and hit me!
What are you looking there?

187
00:28:33,978 --> 00:28:35,036
Enough!

188
00:28:40,284 --> 00:28:41,512
Hit him!
Hit him!

189
00:28:55,533 --> 00:28:57,524
You are such an useless
small boy!

190
00:28:57,668 --> 00:28:58,760
I will kill you.

191
00:29:00,037 --> 00:29:01,527
I will talk to Aarthi.

192
00:29:02,506 --> 00:29:03,632
I will talk till I die.

193
00:29:04,074 --> 00:29:05,564
Don't think I will stop talking to her
cause I'm scared of you.

194
00:29:06,544 --> 00:29:07,943
Now also,
I will go to her house.

195
00:29:08,512 --> 00:29:09,979
She'll put medicine for all
this wounds.

196
00:29:10,114 --> 00:29:10,773
Get on the bicycle!

197
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:12,906
Sympathy will worked out!
Thanks a lot.

198
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:20,428
Take care of your health.

199
00:33:21,999 --> 00:33:23,364
Hostel life will be different.

200
00:33:23,801 --> 00:33:25,666
Be a good boy!
Don't change a lot.

201
00:33:27,371 --> 00:33:31,364
I didn't have money. That's why
I had to borrow them for your admission.

202
00:33:31,675 --> 00:33:33,802
I'm telling you this because l
didn't want you to worry.

203
00:33:33,944 --> 00:33:35,809
Take this.
I'll send you money every month.

204
00:33:39,616 --> 00:33:41,413
Write letter to me.
Write daily.

205
00:33:42,986 --> 00:33:44,385
It will be nice to read them
after 10 years.

206
00:33:50,661 --> 00:33:52,253
I'm saying that you are no more
under my shadow.

207
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:06,870
I still remember you left me
at college and walked away.

208
00:34:07,945 --> 00:34:09,845
I remembered everything
as if it happened yesterday.

209
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:15,115
Sir, Sir.
I don't want, sir.

210
00:34:15,552 --> 00:34:17,315
It's either you smoke or
shave your moustache.

211
00:34:17,454 --> 00:34:18,216
Which one is convenient?

212
00:34:18,355 --> 00:34:19,822
Be like this.
You don't need moustache.

213
00:34:20,824 --> 00:34:23,190
You are still ok.
I was asked to bald my hair.

214
00:34:24,461 --> 00:34:25,826
The letters that you wrote for me
when I was in college.

215
00:34:26,363 --> 00:34:27,227
Your words..

216
00:34:27,698 --> 00:34:28,756
Things that you told me.

217
00:34:43,847 --> 00:34:44,609
Surya!

218
00:34:45,115 --> 00:34:46,946
You are sitting at the
last bench in 2nd year.

219
00:34:47,084 --> 00:34:48,449
What else I can expect from you?

220
00:35:05,068 --> 00:35:06,262
What?
What you will do?

221
00:35:07,237 --> 00:35:08,568
It doesn't mean you can do
anything if you're a senior!

222
00:35:12,009 --> 00:35:12,737
Get lost!

223
00:35:28,792 --> 00:35:30,191
I enjoyed my college life.

224
00:35:30,627 --> 00:35:31,889
I didn't study properly, dad.

225
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:35,629
But I tried for the both of you.

226
00:35:38,602 --> 00:35:40,627
Hei, Sathish!
You don't leave Mala.

227
00:35:43,974 --> 00:35:45,305
Make sure you all collect
Rs500 from Bai.

228
00:36:05,062 --> 00:36:06,723
Sathish, don't miss your last paper!

229
00:36:06,863 --> 00:36:08,296
Try to pass that paper.

230
00:36:08,432 --> 00:36:09,592
If not, you must retake it
in September.

231
00:36:09,766 --> 00:36:10,926
I will come for sure.

232
00:36:25,649 --> 00:36:27,207
On my way to Madras
after college is over,

233
00:36:27,684 --> 00:36:28,582
On that night,

234
00:36:29,219 --> 00:36:30,743
I realised What Was Iove.

235
00:36:31,621 --> 00:36:33,088
When you met mum for
the first time,

236
00:36:33,757 --> 00:36:35,384
I realised how was your feeling.

237
00:37:01,918 --> 00:37:04,409
The moment I saw her,
I thought of mum, dad.

238
00:37:08,992 --> 00:37:11,984
Mom, I thought you were the
most beautiful lady in the world.

239
00:37:12,295 --> 00:37:14,593
But now, there is another girl
who are more beautiful than you.

240
00:37:36,086 --> 00:37:37,986
What time we will reach, sir?
- 6.30pm.

241
00:39:48,285 --> 00:39:49,343
I studied in RAC Trichi.

242
00:39:51,755 --> 00:39:54,280
I've completed my final year.
Going home now.

243
00:39:56,526 --> 00:39:59,017
We have been in the same place for 4 years
but I've never seen her once also.

244
00:39:59,162 --> 00:40:00,197
What were you doing, Surya?

245
00:40:00,197 --> 00:40:01,994
I studied in Moogambikai College.

246
00:40:04,668 --> 00:40:05,828
I've written my final year's exam.

247
00:40:06,169 --> 00:40:07,261
I think I'II complete it.

248
00:40:07,804 --> 00:40:08,828
I will only know that once
my results are out.

249
00:40:09,439 --> 00:40:11,373
That's why I'm still keeping my books.

250
00:40:12,842 --> 00:40:13,866
I'm going home too.

251
00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:15,034
I've seen you before.

252
00:40:15,779 --> 00:40:18,407
You came to my college for
cultural competition.

253
00:40:27,824 --> 00:40:29,451
But I've never seen before.

254
00:40:38,835 --> 00:40:39,802
What is this?

255
00:40:40,837 --> 00:40:41,531
Nothing.

256
00:40:41,972 --> 00:40:43,906
You are doing like this.
You are doing like that.

257
00:40:45,508 --> 00:40:46,440
Are you breathing heavily?

258
00:40:48,945 --> 00:40:49,639
Yes, I am.

259
00:40:56,953 --> 00:40:58,215
It's because of you.

260
00:40:59,389 --> 00:41:00,651
Are you trying to flirt with me?

261
00:41:02,359 --> 00:41:05,055
No, I'm telling the truth.

262
00:41:14,170 --> 00:41:15,068
I can't sit.

263
00:41:28,151 --> 00:41:29,140
Did you get it?

264
00:41:31,755 --> 00:41:32,722
You are smoking, right?

265
00:41:40,363 --> 00:41:42,422
I don't know whether it's right or wrong
when come to think about it now.

266
00:41:43,233 --> 00:41:45,428
You expressed your love to mum
when you met her, right!

267
00:41:46,069 --> 00:41:47,661
That was the only thing was
running in my heart.

268
00:41:49,205 --> 00:41:50,263
Tell her you like her.

269
00:41:54,077 --> 00:41:55,203
Ya, I told.

270
00:41:55,345 --> 00:41:56,903
That's how I felt when I saw your mum.

271
00:41:57,681 --> 00:41:58,579
I tell her the truth.

272
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:03,308
After that only,

273
00:42:30,814 --> 00:42:31,838
Don't look down upon me!

274
00:42:32,215 --> 00:42:33,045
I'm telling the truth.

275
00:42:35,552 --> 00:42:37,110
The moment I saw you,

276
00:42:39,989 --> 00:42:41,115
Girls in white dress.

277
00:42:41,691 --> 00:42:42,953
How you read 'Godfather' before?

278
00:42:43,693 --> 00:42:44,751
Like the thunder bolt in that story.

279
00:42:45,462 --> 00:42:47,191
Like when my dad met my mum.

280
00:42:47,330 --> 00:42:48,228
Everything in one second.

281
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:04,532
It Was nice.

282
00:44:13,016 --> 00:44:14,711
I've never behave Iike this before.

283
00:44:15,285 --> 00:44:16,843
I never had this much of guts.

284
00:44:16,986 --> 00:44:18,078
Didn't even know I had it.

285
00:44:20,056 --> 00:44:22,422
I've never seen a woman
like you before.

286
00:44:26,796 --> 00:44:28,195
That's why I need to tell this.

287
00:44:35,171 --> 00:44:37,036
What you expect me to say now?

288
00:44:40,276 --> 00:44:43,040
I don't believe in love at 1st sight.

289
00:44:45,181 --> 00:44:46,341
You look good.

290
00:44:47,383 --> 00:44:49,283
I liked what ever things that you did.

291
00:44:50,253 --> 00:44:53,120
I've seen you before so
I talked to you.

292
00:44:54,123 --> 00:44:57,490
But there is no love.

293
00:45:00,263 --> 00:45:02,128
I think we must get to know
each other well for that.

294
00:45:03,766 --> 00:45:05,063
We must understand each other.

295
00:45:05,668 --> 00:45:06,828
I don't know..
- Let's do it then.

296
00:45:08,204 --> 00:45:09,330
Let's get to know each other.

297
00:45:10,573 --> 00:45:11,767
It's not that easy.

298
00:45:23,853 --> 00:45:26,014
I understand.
I don't need anything.

299
00:45:26,556 --> 00:45:28,080
Just answer to three questions.

300
00:45:28,925 --> 00:45:29,914
Are you married?

301
00:45:33,162 --> 00:45:34,652
Would be?
Engaged to someone?

302
00:45:37,901 --> 00:45:40,096
Do you love anyone?
- No.

303
00:45:40,603 --> 00:45:41,729
That's enough.

304
00:45:42,639 --> 00:45:44,231
No matter where you are,
I'll come looking for you.

305
00:45:53,249 --> 00:45:54,113
Go and sleep.

306
00:45:54,250 --> 00:45:55,740
I've made you to stay awake
for a long time.

307
00:45:58,755 --> 00:46:01,553
I didn't know what else
I expected her to say!

308
00:46:02,158 --> 00:46:03,420
But I told.

309
00:46:17,607 --> 00:46:19,905
Normally, some old songs will be
playing in my heart.

310
00:46:20,410 --> 00:46:23,243
But the moment I saw her,
first time in life,

311
00:46:23,379 --> 00:46:27,016
A new song,
my first own composition, dad.

312
00:46:27,016 --> 00:46:27,380
A new song,
my first own composition, dad.

313
00:47:26,643 --> 00:47:28,804
You are the raindrops that
rains in my heart.

314
00:47:30,647 --> 00:47:32,615
Lotus that sinks in water.

315
00:47:35,852 --> 00:47:37,376
The sudden changes in the sky.

316
00:47:37,987 --> 00:47:39,784
Girl, it's your responsible.

317
00:47:50,733 --> 00:47:51,722
A dream on that day,

318
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:53,662
I still remember it till today, dad.

319
00:52:09,225 --> 00:52:10,783
I don't have anything.

320
00:52:11,294 --> 00:52:11,988
I will give you some how.

321
00:52:12,128 --> 00:52:13,561
End of the month,
I will come and give.

322
00:52:14,063 --> 00:52:15,189
It has been 3 months, Krishnan.

323
00:52:16,432 --> 00:52:17,990
Please don't talk loud.
My son is inside.

324
00:52:18,134 --> 00:52:19,431
You know about me, right?
- so, you are asking me to leave?

325
00:52:21,938 --> 00:52:24,236
Please don't borrow money
from the Seth anymore.

326
00:52:26,042 --> 00:52:27,009
We will handle it.

327
00:52:27,677 --> 00:52:28,769
How much you borrowed from him?

328
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:32,648
First, we settle his money.

329
00:52:34,116 --> 00:52:37,483
Mum, the balance LlC
housing loan is a lot, right?

330
00:52:39,455 --> 00:52:41,980
That want also we will start
to pay monthly.

331
00:52:43,826 --> 00:52:46,317
Then, we must redeem
mum's jewellary.

332
00:52:48,464 --> 00:52:49,897
Our house project is stopped
half way, right?

333
00:52:51,634 --> 00:52:52,965
We must start the project again.

334
00:52:55,771 --> 00:52:56,601
That's all, right?

335
00:52:57,807 --> 00:52:59,240
You have said it easily.

336
00:52:59,875 --> 00:53:01,570
But I've spent 15 years in these.

337
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:05,847
How come you are saying it
so easily?

338
00:53:05,982 --> 00:53:07,779
How we can pay all
our debt so fast?

339
00:53:08,050 --> 00:53:09,642
It will happen.
You will see.

340
00:53:14,824 --> 00:53:16,018
You have worked very hard
all this while, dad.

341
00:53:16,158 --> 00:53:17,022
That is enough.

342
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:20,996
You have never sit on the chair
with your leg crossed.

343
00:53:21,397 --> 00:53:23,422
And you have taught us that it is wrong.

344
00:53:23,833 --> 00:53:24,800
But I tell you now.

345
00:53:24,934 --> 00:53:26,367
The time has come for all that.

346
00:53:27,103 --> 00:53:30,163
sit relax on the chair
with your leg crossed.

347
00:53:32,108 --> 00:53:34,042
Get your retirement, dad.

348
00:53:35,644 --> 00:53:38,374
The money that you'll get, transfer them
into both of your accounts.

349
00:53:38,514 --> 00:53:40,243
That money is only for both of you.

350
00:53:45,821 --> 00:53:49,814
I don't like to see dad working
so hard like this.

351
00:53:53,295 --> 00:53:54,091
What, mum?

352
00:53:54,897 --> 00:53:56,558
I've told him this many times.

353
00:53:56,799 --> 00:53:58,232
But this is your dad's decision.

354
00:54:00,002 --> 00:54:01,026
Your children have grown up.

355
00:54:03,472 --> 00:54:05,174
Yesterday, we talked about
the honeymoon.

356
00:54:05,174 --> 00:54:06,539
I think we must go for it.

357
00:54:08,411 --> 00:54:10,402
I wanted to fix everything
after my studies.

358
00:54:11,013 --> 00:54:12,776
I decided that you should not
suffer anymore, dad.

359
00:54:16,819 --> 00:54:19,549
I wanted to bring Meghna
too to our home.

360
00:54:28,064 --> 00:54:29,156
What are you doing here?

361
00:54:29,999 --> 00:54:31,159
I told you I'll come, right?

362
00:54:33,035 --> 00:54:33,899
This one.

363
00:54:34,036 --> 00:54:35,628
Don't worry.
I won't sing all.

364
00:54:35,905 --> 00:54:37,429
Just in case if you have
forgotten me.

365
00:54:37,573 --> 00:54:39,165
That's why for you to
remember me,

366
00:54:39,308 --> 00:54:41,572
I brought the same guitar,
wearing the same t-shirt and jean.

367
00:54:42,044 --> 00:54:43,477
Does it look like a bit over?

368
00:54:44,513 --> 00:54:46,208
What if someone else opened
the door means?

369
00:54:46,882 --> 00:54:48,577
My dad dislikes all this.

370
00:54:48,984 --> 00:54:52,010
That's right.
A dad should be like that.

371
00:54:52,388 --> 00:54:54,913
But I know he's not at home now.

372
00:54:55,791 --> 00:54:57,281
I saw your parents going out.

373
00:54:59,228 --> 00:55:01,219
No one else is at home, right?

374
00:55:01,363 --> 00:55:03,388
What about brother?
Don't have, right?

375
00:55:07,736 --> 00:55:09,636
Don't laugh like that, Meghna.

376
00:55:11,907 --> 00:55:13,238
I thought you have forgotten me.

377
00:55:14,643 --> 00:55:16,577
I didn't thought you'll come again.

378
00:55:17,413 --> 00:55:18,402
What you want?

379
00:55:22,184 --> 00:55:24,584
Want to get to know you.

380
00:55:25,254 --> 00:55:26,619
So, I tried to get into that effort.

381
00:55:39,435 --> 00:55:40,993
Tomorrow?
Tomorrow?

382
00:55:42,905 --> 00:55:44,964
Now, I can't.
Tomorrow is also impossible.

383
00:55:45,207 --> 00:55:47,471
Definitely, I can't.
I've a lots of work to do.

384
00:55:48,210 --> 00:55:49,074
In one Week time,

385
00:55:50,913 --> 00:55:53,313
It's not easy to meet outside easily.

386
00:55:54,083 --> 00:55:55,311
My dad is very strict.

387
00:55:59,388 --> 00:56:02,585
You said you're going out of town.
To Trichi?

388
00:56:08,130 --> 00:56:09,597
For holiday, isn't it?

389
00:56:09,732 --> 00:56:11,563
No, to study.

390
00:56:17,473 --> 00:56:19,998
The one that they will
teach you for 2 years.

391
00:56:26,282 --> 00:56:28,045
You have just sat for your
final year's exam.

392
00:56:28,184 --> 00:56:29,617
So fast you are going abroad?

393
00:56:29,752 --> 00:56:31,583
What if you fail in any of
the subject?

394
00:56:32,021 --> 00:56:33,420
Don't tell me you will
come back from there?

395
00:56:33,556 --> 00:56:35,820
They won't take you there
without your mark sheet.

396
00:56:35,958 --> 00:56:37,550
My course is starting in
August only.

397
00:56:37,693 --> 00:56:40,787
But I'm going to do a project
before that.

398
00:56:46,602 --> 00:56:47,864
There's no chance for me to fail.

399
00:57:01,517 --> 00:57:02,449
One week means?

400
00:57:07,323 --> 00:57:08,756
Do you really have to go?

401
00:57:10,793 --> 00:57:12,784
This is my ambition,
my dad's dream.

402
00:57:13,729 --> 00:57:16,527
Not only that.
I plan to settle there after my studies.

403
00:57:19,868 --> 00:57:22,962
How if all the intelligence
study and work there means?

404
00:57:23,405 --> 00:57:26,374
You will study, work and
pay tax there.

405
00:57:26,508 --> 00:57:27,440
That country will be good.

406
00:57:27,576 --> 00:57:30,272
Why don't you study, work
and pay tax here?

407
00:57:30,412 --> 00:57:31,606
Our country will be better.

408
00:57:32,781 --> 00:57:34,248
I will live happily too, right!

409
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:40,385
You should have told me
about this that day itself.

410
00:57:40,823 --> 00:57:42,188
I wouldn't have wasted these 5 days.

411
00:57:42,491 --> 00:57:45,221
I would have come the next day
itself with my guitar.

412
00:57:46,328 --> 00:57:48,796
That's why!
We shouldn't be decent at all.

413
00:57:57,940 --> 00:58:01,842
I want to spend my life with you.

414
00:58:11,387 --> 00:58:13,014
How you could love someone
at first sight?

415
00:58:13,555 --> 00:58:14,647
I don't understand.

416
00:58:19,328 --> 00:58:20,727
So, it's just lust.

417
00:58:28,070 --> 00:58:31,233
After that, my parents must
like you.

418
00:58:35,411 --> 00:58:36,275
He will ask.

419
00:58:36,779 --> 00:58:38,747
What is his job?
What he have studied?

420
00:58:39,181 --> 00:58:40,170
Is he a good guy?

421
00:58:42,051 --> 00:58:43,075
Does he earns a lot?

422
00:58:44,086 --> 00:58:47,180
Will he take care of you?
Will he die for you?

423
00:58:48,724 --> 00:58:51,124
He must say that you are
the right guy.

424
00:58:51,827 --> 00:58:52,987
Same goes in your house, right?

425
00:58:54,396 --> 00:58:56,626
Your mum must also say that
I'm the right girl, right?

426
00:59:12,247 --> 00:59:13,680
Which university in America?

427
00:59:17,853 --> 00:59:19,013
I will come.

428
00:59:21,023 --> 00:59:23,253
Meghna.
That is a nice name.

429
00:59:24,893 --> 00:59:25,882
Is it a tragedy?

430
00:59:26,362 --> 00:59:27,795
You are my son, what!

431
00:59:30,332 --> 00:59:31,321
No, dad.

432
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:33,631
She's going, dad.

433
00:59:34,203 --> 00:59:35,135
You go too.

434
00:59:36,438 --> 00:59:37,598
America is just here.

435
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:39,234
Go and bring her back.

436
00:59:40,609 --> 00:59:41,268
What's wrong with this?

437
00:59:42,411 --> 00:59:44,743
I used your room when
you are not around.

438
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:45,744
Let me take my book.

439
00:59:48,217 --> 00:59:50,742
You were my inspiration in every
important situation in my life.

440
00:59:51,687 --> 00:59:54,622
You are the one taught me that
America is very nearby.

441
00:59:56,291 --> 00:59:57,781
I must solve all the problem at home.

442
00:59:58,394 --> 01:00:01,693
When I thought of getting to know Meghna
in that one week time,

443
01:00:02,431 --> 01:00:03,625
I still remember that.

444
01:00:03,932 --> 01:00:04,830
The next day,

445
01:00:05,033 --> 01:00:06,295
You had a heart attack.

446
01:00:11,073 --> 01:00:12,005
What happened?
- Mum!

447
01:00:12,141 --> 01:00:13,005
Nothing.

448
01:00:14,309 --> 01:00:15,799
All because of this cigarette.

449
01:00:15,944 --> 01:00:18,606
I told him in the morning also
not to smoke a lot.

450
01:00:19,314 --> 01:00:21,305
He should have stopped smoking.
- Where were both of you that time?

451
01:00:21,683 --> 01:00:23,048
We were in Uncle Morris's house.

452
01:00:23,185 --> 01:00:25,915
He hold his head and sat.
Suddenly, he fell down.

453
01:00:26,054 --> 01:00:27,453
What did the doctor said?
How is he now?

454
01:00:27,589 --> 01:00:28,453
He's ok now.

455
01:00:50,779 --> 01:00:53,213
I couldn't see you lying
on the hospital bed, dad.

456
01:00:54,183 --> 01:00:56,708
I still remember.

457
01:00:57,719 --> 01:00:59,243
I was with you for one whole week.

458
01:00:59,855 --> 01:01:00,981
I have forgotten Meghna.

459
01:01:01,590 --> 01:01:03,148
But I know that she must
have left already.

460
01:01:03,992 --> 01:01:06,017
Nothing was important to me
except you, dad.

461
01:01:18,407 --> 01:01:19,339
Come, sir.

462
01:01:20,476 --> 01:01:21,602
It Iooks neat.

463
01:01:24,413 --> 01:01:26,438
How much is the rent?
- Rs7,000, sir.

464
01:01:28,150 --> 01:01:28,980
Water supply is ok.

465
01:01:31,653 --> 01:01:32,677
What is the plan?

466
01:01:38,927 --> 01:01:40,451
We have done that project in college.

467
01:01:40,596 --> 01:01:43,064
I did that project.
- Okay!

468
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:46,193
I was the one who typed it.
I'm the one who know the people in that
company.

469
01:01:46,935 --> 01:01:48,903
We must start again our
house project.

470
01:01:50,072 --> 01:01:52,336
I want you and mum to stay
in your own home.

471
01:01:52,708 --> 01:01:54,232
That was the only thing was
in my heart.

472
01:01:54,910 --> 01:01:56,104
I've gained my responsibility.

473
01:01:56,578 --> 01:01:57,943
It started to work.

474
01:01:58,313 --> 01:01:59,837
It's all because of you, dad.

475
01:02:00,449 --> 01:02:01,416
For you.

476
01:02:14,696 --> 01:02:16,220
Why are you giving me
the businessman feel?

477
01:02:16,565 --> 01:02:17,623
Don't ask that!

478
01:02:25,107 --> 01:02:27,974
I'm going to sing a song from
my own composition.

479
01:02:37,085 --> 01:02:38,177
Will the loan get sanctioned?

480
01:02:38,520 --> 01:02:39,680
Yes, it will.

481
01:02:41,957 --> 01:02:42,651
Take it.

482
01:02:43,625 --> 01:02:45,217
Looks like a lot of work
need to be done.

483
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:47,294
Ya, it has been stopped

484
01:02:57,472 --> 01:02:58,734
If we take this hall out,
we will get the space.

485
01:02:58,874 --> 01:02:59,738
Everything is ok.

486
01:02:59,875 --> 01:03:02,810
I want a bar, a mini one
in a corner.

487
01:03:02,945 --> 01:03:03,775
Darling, you come.

488
01:03:03,912 --> 01:03:05,402
Tell where shall we put it.
- Very important now.

489
01:03:08,417 --> 01:03:09,509
Only painting work is balance.

490
01:03:09,651 --> 01:03:10,811
Will take another week, right?
- It's nice.

491
01:03:11,453 --> 01:03:12,442
It looks nice right, mum!

492
01:03:27,869 --> 01:03:28,767
Dad, wait.

493
01:03:31,073 --> 01:03:32,335
We always share one pillow.

494
01:03:40,315 --> 01:03:42,613
After that,
once again Meghna.

495
01:03:45,220 --> 01:03:46,482
Don't you think this is too much?

496
01:03:46,888 --> 01:03:48,412
They are going to hold your passport.

497
01:03:48,657 --> 01:03:51,023
Because you are candidate
without any eligibility.

498
01:03:54,062 --> 01:03:55,723
You never thought about this
all this while?

499
01:03:55,998 --> 01:03:57,966
You never even say a word
about that girl.

500
01:03:58,300 --> 01:03:59,733
Why now suddenly?

501
01:04:02,237 --> 01:04:03,135
What, buddy?

502
01:04:04,172 --> 01:04:05,036
Buddy!

503
01:04:07,776 --> 01:04:09,505
Ya, right.
- I couldn't forget her, buddy.

504
01:04:10,012 --> 01:04:11,445
Let's see first whether I'm
getting visa or not.

505
01:04:55,390 --> 01:04:56,448
What sing is this?

506
01:04:56,591 --> 01:04:57,990
It's nice.
From which movie?

507
01:04:58,126 --> 01:05:00,026
What?
This is my own composition.

508
01:05:00,328 --> 01:05:01,420
Has not released in any movie.

509
01:05:01,563 --> 01:05:03,588
It will take another 10 to 15 years
for this kind of tune to come.

510
01:05:04,166 --> 01:05:05,929
Don't talk in ghetto just
because you got the visa.

511
01:05:06,068 --> 01:05:09,526
Before they realise their mistake,
you better go and come back soon from
America.

512
01:05:09,671 --> 01:05:11,798
Mum, you tell me.
Shall I go to America?

513
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:14,902
Go and come.
Stay happy.

514
01:05:19,014 --> 01:05:22,211
Go.
Go and bring her back.

515
01:05:28,390 --> 01:05:31,223
I didn't go there neither to
work nor to study.

516
01:05:32,127 --> 01:05:33,958
You sent me there for my love.

517
01:05:54,549 --> 01:05:55,846
No matter where you are,
I will come looking for you.

518
01:08:38,613 --> 01:08:40,240
Who are you?
Surya?

519
01:08:40,382 --> 01:08:41,974
Why did you came?
Have I seen you before?

520
01:08:42,117 --> 01:08:42,981
I don't Iike all this.

521
01:09:37,973 --> 01:09:39,634
Are you studying in Berkeley University?

522
01:09:41,242 --> 01:09:42,368
When did you joined?

523
01:09:43,445 --> 01:09:44,377
No chance.

524
01:09:44,980 --> 01:09:49,007
I haven't pass one paper
in my final year.

525
01:09:49,317 --> 01:09:50,841
I just retake that paper.

526
01:09:52,821 --> 01:09:54,789
This time also,
it won't exceed 10 marks.

527
01:09:56,191 --> 01:09:58,216
Must retake again.
Maybe in April or September.

528
01:09:58,626 --> 01:10:02,494
Even if I get 1st class,
I won't be studying here.

529
01:10:02,630 --> 01:10:03,494
Then,

530
01:10:07,435 --> 01:10:08,424
I came to see you.

531
01:10:15,877 --> 01:10:16,809
Come.

532
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:27,945
Is this your house?
- Ya, I live here.

533
01:10:31,359 --> 01:10:33,418
For students stay outside
the university.

534
01:10:36,931 --> 01:10:37,727
Are you staying in hotel?

535
01:10:37,866 --> 01:10:40,198
Ya, at University Avenue.

536
01:10:40,869 --> 01:10:43,804
After checked in there,
I was searching for you the whole university.

537
01:10:43,938 --> 01:10:45,405
Then, I found you.

538
01:10:50,578 --> 01:10:52,443
Bring your bag.
Come and stay here.

539
01:10:58,820 --> 01:11:00,447
It's only US$40.
- I'll be in college the whole day..

540
01:11:02,824 --> 01:11:03,813
You can stay here.

541
01:11:04,292 --> 01:11:06,783
In your room.
It won't be nice.

542
01:11:08,396 --> 01:11:10,455
I still remember talking to you
in the phone from there.

543
01:11:10,799 --> 01:11:12,426
I will feel like telling you
everything.

544
01:11:13,201 --> 01:11:14,099
And I will tell.

545
01:11:14,235 --> 01:11:15,668
I stayed in a motel last night.

546
01:11:18,306 --> 01:11:20,274
She asked me to stay
with her in her room.

547
01:11:21,142 --> 01:11:22,632
Then, you better talk to your mom.

548
01:11:22,777 --> 01:11:24,836
What he's saying?
- He's staying with the girl, it seems.

549
01:11:26,347 --> 01:11:27,041
Give it to me.

550
01:11:27,916 --> 01:11:29,679
Surya, what daddy is saying?

551
01:11:51,940 --> 01:11:53,771
Next state like Bombay
or Kerala is still ok.

552
01:11:54,275 --> 01:11:55,902
Will anyone come this far?

553
01:11:57,345 --> 01:12:01,213
I didn't come neither to impress you
nor to give impact to you.

554
01:12:01,783 --> 01:12:02,750
It's very selfish.

555
01:12:02,884 --> 01:12:04,852
I came to see you and
to be with you.

556
01:12:07,922 --> 01:12:10,584
Do you know, dad?
I lived with her for 90 days.

557
01:12:13,094 --> 01:12:14,994
It was like an llayaraja's song, dad.

558
01:18:07,715 --> 01:18:09,307
I want to live my life with you.

559
01:18:10,685 --> 01:18:14,416
I like you and my dad
will like you a lot too.

560
01:18:17,124 --> 01:18:20,924
Job, education.
He won't ask anything.

561
01:18:23,498 --> 01:18:25,193
He knows that you are
a good guy.

562
01:18:30,004 --> 01:18:31,596
He knows that you will
take care of me well.

563
01:18:33,207 --> 01:18:35,198
He knows that you will die for me.

564
01:18:37,645 --> 01:18:41,342
He will say that you are
the right guy.

565
01:18:45,820 --> 01:18:47,947
Will your mum say that
I'm the right girl for you?

566
01:19:22,056 --> 01:19:25,890
There's nothing beautiful here
except for you and this bridge.

567
01:19:30,097 --> 01:19:31,257
This is for you.

568
01:20:41,869 --> 01:20:42,665
What?

569
01:20:43,237 --> 01:20:46,468
I want to stay at the motel
beside this.

570
01:20:46,774 --> 01:20:49,470
I'll stay there tonight.
That will be right.

571
01:20:51,078 --> 01:20:52,067
After your class over.

572
01:20:56,083 --> 01:20:59,541
What?
No, you can stay here.

573
01:21:09,463 --> 01:21:10,487
What's the problem?

574
01:21:13,801 --> 01:21:14,733
You are the problem.

575
01:21:16,604 --> 01:21:18,037
You made me stand upside down.

576
01:21:21,676 --> 01:21:22,734
Not because it's cold.

577
01:21:24,278 --> 01:21:25,609
I feel so confused.

578
01:21:27,815 --> 01:21:28,679
Since when?

579
01:21:31,919 --> 01:21:34,387
Since I kissed you.

580
01:21:41,328 --> 01:21:42,317
Don't torture me!

581
01:21:43,497 --> 01:21:46,295
You stay there and
I will sleep in this corner.

582
01:22:28,442 --> 01:22:31,275
She told she'll marry me.

583
01:22:32,046 --> 01:22:32,910
She got the girl.

584
01:22:33,848 --> 01:22:35,713
She told me yesterday evening.

585
01:22:36,450 --> 01:22:38,816
I told her that we can get
married in 4 years time.

586
01:22:38,953 --> 01:22:40,181
Yes, yes.

587
01:22:40,321 --> 01:22:41,185
Must be like that.

588
01:22:42,723 --> 01:22:43,587
Be happy.

589
01:22:43,724 --> 01:22:44,782
Your mum is here.
I'll give the phone to her.

590
01:22:48,195 --> 01:22:49,389
You are getting married here, right?

591
01:22:51,465 --> 01:22:52,489
When are you coming back?

592
01:22:52,633 --> 01:22:55,067
Got an Oklahoma trip in 3 days.

593
01:22:55,202 --> 01:22:57,432
She's going there for a
project matter.

594
01:22:57,972 --> 01:23:00,031
I will go there too and then
I will come back.

595
01:23:00,174 --> 01:23:01,198
You come with me.

596
01:23:02,476 --> 01:23:03,773
My friends are there.

597
01:23:05,212 --> 01:23:07,976
You will have lots of work there.
You'll be busy for 2 days.

598
01:23:08,282 --> 01:23:11,342
If I sit in the bus,
I'll think about you and come.

599
01:23:11,685 --> 01:23:13,084
I can at least visit all the
places here.

600
01:23:13,220 --> 01:23:14,710
It is just 2 days.
I will come.

601
01:23:17,892 --> 01:23:20,383
I've told lot about you and mum
to Meghna.

602
01:23:21,328 --> 01:23:22,488
I Ioved her.

603
01:24:52,253 --> 01:24:53,914
There is one thing that l
didn't tell you, dad.

604
01:24:54,788 --> 01:24:57,586
When the Federal Building blasted
in Oklahoma,

605
01:24:58,058 --> 01:24:59,958
I was just walking 200m away.

606
01:25:00,561 --> 01:25:03,758
If I reached there 10 minutes earlier,
I would have died on that day.

607
01:26:59,013 --> 01:27:00,981
Yes, I saw the news in BBC.

608
01:27:01,715 --> 01:27:03,842
She was in that building.

609
01:27:08,355 --> 01:27:10,016
Nothing happened, right?
What happened?

610
01:27:16,764 --> 01:27:17,594
How do you know that?

611
01:27:18,032 --> 01:27:19,260
Were you there that time?

612
01:27:19,400 --> 01:27:21,561
Did you saw her, Surya?

613
01:27:21,969 --> 01:27:26,838
She died on the way
to the hospital.

614
01:27:28,342 --> 01:27:29,969
I don't knoWwhat to do, dad.

615
01:27:35,682 --> 01:27:37,707
We were like you and mum.

616
01:27:39,486 --> 01:27:40,316
What happened?

617
01:27:55,836 --> 01:27:57,770
I can't take it, dad.

618
01:28:03,310 --> 01:28:06,575
Surya, were you there at that time?

619
01:28:07,147 --> 01:28:08,341
Are you ok?

620
01:28:08,916 --> 01:28:10,008
Let me talk.

621
01:28:10,384 --> 01:28:11,942
Surya, talk to me.

622
01:28:12,786 --> 01:28:15,254
You come back to me immediately.

623
01:28:16,123 --> 01:28:16,953
He's crying.

624
01:28:17,391 --> 01:28:18,722
Why he's not talking to me?
- I can't hear.

625
01:28:23,397 --> 01:28:25,126
I didn't want you to know
my pain, dad.

626
01:28:25,599 --> 01:28:27,396
But to whom else I can cry to?

627
01:28:28,068 --> 01:28:29,467
On whose shoulder I can lean?

628
01:29:23,223 --> 01:29:27,057
I like you and my dad
will like you too.

629
01:29:28,162 --> 01:29:29,754
He knows that you are
a good guy.

630
01:29:31,031 --> 01:29:32,794
He knows that you will
take care of me well.

631
01:29:34,635 --> 01:29:36,330
He knows that you'll die
for me.

632
01:30:28,655 --> 01:30:30,122
I didn't tell you this too, dad.

633
01:30:30,691 --> 01:30:33,182
I went to all the place that
Meghna and I went.

634
01:30:34,061 --> 01:30:37,895
Suddenly, I thought of just go
and look for her.

635
01:30:38,699 --> 01:30:40,360
I couldn't believe that she is
no more alive.

636
01:30:41,468 --> 01:30:43,231
I thought of not returning to you.

637
01:30:43,937 --> 01:30:45,632
Thought of going somewhere else.

638
01:31:02,723 --> 01:31:04,020
Why did you left us and go?

639
01:31:08,462 --> 01:31:10,555
Everything that happened in my life
is in front of my eyes now.

640
01:31:11,398 --> 01:31:12,922
Once I returned from America,

641
01:31:13,300 --> 01:31:17,396
I wanted to tell about Meghna and cry
to you, mum and Shreya.

642
01:31:18,305 --> 01:31:21,206
I thought everything will be fine
if I hug you means, dad.

643
01:31:22,409 --> 01:31:23,433
I came back.

644
01:32:05,786 --> 01:32:06,775
Shankar Menon.

645
01:32:08,922 --> 01:32:11,720
When talking to him,
it reminds me of you, dad.

646
01:32:12,693 --> 01:32:15,355
He has a style like you.

647
01:32:16,029 --> 01:32:18,054
I felt like talking to him.

648
01:32:18,665 --> 01:32:19,723
I told him everything.

649
01:32:23,804 --> 01:32:24,793
Must be a lot.

650
01:32:26,873 --> 01:32:28,864
Keep all the memories inside.

651
01:32:29,076 --> 01:32:29,974
It Will be difficult.

652
01:32:31,678 --> 01:32:34,772
But only those memories will bring
your strength out.

653
01:32:35,215 --> 01:32:36,182
Get hold of it.

654
01:32:47,127 --> 01:32:48,287
No, Surya.
It's ok.

655
01:32:50,163 --> 01:32:51,231
Don't get me wrong.

656
01:32:51,231 --> 01:32:52,630
If you want to be free,
I'll go back there.

657
01:32:58,805 --> 01:33:00,773
My father passed away
a year ago.

658
01:33:00,941 --> 01:33:02,142
I was broken.

659
01:33:02,142 --> 01:33:04,076
But I have a son.

660
01:33:04,845 --> 01:33:06,176
He is 5 years old.

661
01:33:06,613 --> 01:33:09,946
The way he talked and all the
little things that he does,

662
01:33:10,083 --> 01:33:12,608
Made me to came through that.

663
01:33:12,753 --> 01:33:14,584
You must have anything
like that, Surya.

664
01:33:18,792 --> 01:33:20,089
I've told you before.

665
01:33:22,462 --> 01:33:24,327
Surya, come.

666
01:33:33,073 --> 01:33:35,098
It was very sad.

667
01:33:36,276 --> 01:33:37,208
Never mind, dad.

668
01:33:45,519 --> 01:33:48,010
Come.
Sit down.

669
01:33:50,724 --> 01:33:53,659
You don't worry.
We are here for you.

670
01:33:54,861 --> 01:33:56,795
The days I was silent.

671
01:33:57,431 --> 01:33:58,625
You were with me, dad.

672
01:34:01,001 --> 01:34:01,933
How are you?

673
01:34:04,304 --> 01:34:06,204
Why are you just sitting
at home?

674
01:34:07,040 --> 01:34:09,531
You know that your office is
going well, right?

675
01:34:09,943 --> 01:34:10,932
Go and visit everyone and come.

676
01:34:21,188 --> 01:34:23,554
The days I was only with my bike.

677
01:34:49,082 --> 01:34:50,071
Priya!

678
01:34:50,984 --> 01:34:52,611
The days I started to get to
know her.

679
01:35:18,645 --> 01:35:19,612
Why now?

680
01:35:19,746 --> 01:35:21,008
Why you stopped half way?

681
01:35:33,593 --> 01:35:34,890
I'm having a small party at home.

682
01:35:38,999 --> 01:35:40,694
Shreya is coming.
I want you to come too.

683
01:35:42,669 --> 01:35:43,601
I will see hoW.

684
01:36:11,064 --> 01:36:11,996
What are you laughing at?

685
01:36:13,667 --> 01:36:16,192
The days I tried to forget Meghna.

686
01:36:18,104 --> 01:36:19,901
I bought a book for you.

687
01:36:20,240 --> 01:36:21,172
I want you to read.

688
01:36:23,109 --> 01:36:25,509
But, I paid for that.
- I'll return your money.

689
01:36:34,254 --> 01:36:35,619
She told me goodbye and
walked away.

690
01:36:36,389 --> 01:36:37,583
She didn't turn and looked.

691
01:36:38,825 --> 01:36:40,383
I felt one kind.

692
01:36:40,594 --> 01:36:43,961
Disturbed feeling for 10 minutes.

693
01:36:44,297 --> 01:36:45,229
Inside me.

694
01:36:49,302 --> 01:36:51,133
I thought I'll never see her
after that.

695
01:36:54,908 --> 01:36:57,570
The pain came again.
Suddenly.

696
01:36:58,511 --> 01:36:59,637
I couldn't take it.

697
01:37:00,480 --> 01:37:02,641
I couldn't forget Meghna.

698
01:37:03,617 --> 01:37:05,050
The pain did not go.

699
01:38:00,440 --> 01:38:01,839
The alcohol bottle that
you hid, dad.

700
01:38:04,511 --> 01:38:08,072
Horrible days that I want to forget
in my life.

701
01:38:09,449 --> 01:38:10,711
She came, buddy.

702
01:38:11,551 --> 01:38:13,542
Into my life by a train.

703
01:38:13,687 --> 01:38:14,551
Ok, buddy.

704
01:38:19,526 --> 01:38:21,118
They carried her in a stretcher.

705
01:38:23,396 --> 01:38:25,489
It was like they carried my
dream away.

706
01:38:32,005 --> 01:38:32,937
What he thinks?
- You keep quiet!

707
01:38:33,073 --> 01:38:34,199
If he does like this, we don't sit
with him anymore.

708
01:38:34,340 --> 01:38:35,932
Let's go from here.
What do you think you're doing?

709
01:38:36,076 --> 01:38:36,940
Leave it.
Sit down.

710
01:38:38,712 --> 01:38:39,610
She's Anjalai, buddy.

711
01:38:46,152 --> 01:38:48,245
She's my Anjalai.
- Ok, buddy.

712
01:38:52,292 --> 01:38:53,384
She's my Megalai.

713
01:38:56,229 --> 01:38:57,719
She's my Aandal, buddy.

714
01:39:01,868 --> 01:39:03,927
What, Surya?

715
01:39:10,009 --> 01:39:12,068
This is called as the death music.

716
01:39:13,413 --> 01:39:14,539
He has gone crazy.

717
01:39:14,814 --> 01:39:16,941
I think we must carry him home.

718
01:39:18,051 --> 01:39:19,814
You get ready.
- He's dancing steadily.

719
01:40:32,625 --> 01:40:34,217
Surya, get up!

720
01:44:37,837 --> 01:44:39,771
Dad, you told me not to smoke.

721
01:44:39,972 --> 01:44:43,464
But I went beyond that.

722
01:44:54,020 --> 01:44:55,180
Come after 10 minutes.

723
01:44:55,922 --> 01:44:56,911
What's in your hand, Surya?

724
01:45:00,026 --> 01:45:01,584
I want to talk to you some more.

725
01:45:04,230 --> 01:45:06,130
Take your hand off!

726
01:45:11,337 --> 01:45:12,804
I wanted to talk to you.

727
01:45:13,473 --> 01:45:15,031
It's my fault for not talking
to you earlier.

728
01:45:23,149 --> 01:45:24,377
What's all this, Surya?

729
01:45:25,551 --> 01:45:27,018
What happen to you?
- I can't be without all that.

730
01:45:27,153 --> 01:45:28,017
I want that.

731
01:45:28,688 --> 01:45:29,586
You won't understand.

732
01:45:32,125 --> 01:45:33,057
I am here for you.

733
01:45:36,329 --> 01:45:38,388
I won't let you do all this.
- Do you know how hard to get this?

734
01:45:40,600 --> 01:45:41,760
Let's sit and talk, Surya.

735
01:45:41,901 --> 01:45:42,629
You don't need all this.

736
01:45:42,768 --> 01:45:44,599
I asked you to go out...
I went to hit you.

737
01:45:45,104 --> 01:45:46,230
I still remember.

738
01:45:49,675 --> 01:45:50,642
It's nothing.

739
01:45:55,381 --> 01:45:58,839
I can't live without this...
You know how hard for me to get it?

740
01:45:58,985 --> 01:46:02,318
He split it.
- It's gone now.

741
01:46:04,190 --> 01:46:05,953
I can't do anything without this.

742
01:46:07,326 --> 01:46:08,554
I can't talk, I can't laugh.

743
01:46:08,694 --> 01:46:09,558
I can't sit, I can't stand.

744
01:46:09,695 --> 01:46:10,559
I can't sing, I can't forget.

745
01:46:10,696 --> 01:46:12,186
I can't do anything, mum.

746
01:46:14,567 --> 01:46:16,865
I've been doing drugs
for 3 months, mum.

747
01:46:17,003 --> 01:46:19,335
I'm still alive because of this or
I'm already dead by now.

748
01:46:25,378 --> 01:46:26,902
I want this!

749
01:46:31,250 --> 01:46:32,581
Both of you are living happily, right?

750
01:46:32,919 --> 01:46:34,318
Both of you won't understand this!

751
01:46:36,189 --> 01:46:37,213
Get out!

752
01:46:39,759 --> 01:46:40,987
I'm going out.

753
01:46:41,327 --> 01:46:43,522
I won't be back tonight.
- No, I won't let you go anywhere.

754
01:46:46,566 --> 01:46:47,760
Listen to us!

755
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:49,433
Let me go.

756
01:46:51,270 --> 01:46:52,635
You don't need this!

757
01:46:54,340 --> 01:46:56,808
Let me go!
Let me go, mum!

758
01:46:56,943 --> 01:46:58,001
Or I will die.

759
01:46:58,144 --> 01:47:00,112
You don't need this.

760
01:47:00,246 --> 01:47:01,838
I'm here for you.
Your dad is here for you too.

761
01:47:20,399 --> 01:47:22,162
Don't think I'm comparing
you badly.

762
01:47:23,436 --> 01:47:25,996
Do you still remember cricket
match on your tenth standard?

763
01:47:27,406 --> 01:47:30,204
You got scolded.

764
01:47:31,143 --> 01:47:33,771
You came out so
angrily and cried.

765
01:47:34,513 --> 01:47:35,502
shouted.

766
01:47:38,684 --> 01:47:40,276
Then, came your turn to ball.

767
01:47:40,886 --> 01:47:41,978
You threw the ball fiercely.

768
01:47:45,925 --> 01:47:48,792
You changed your
angriness into a positive energy.

769
01:47:49,195 --> 01:47:51,060
As now, you should do that too.

770
01:47:51,197 --> 01:47:54,894
Everything like your anger, disappointments
should be changed into a positive energy.

771
01:47:56,335 --> 01:47:57,825
Get your guitar and go out.

772
01:47:59,071 --> 01:48:00,038
Make everyone happy.

773
01:48:00,172 --> 01:48:01,264
Whatever happens..

774
01:48:07,380 --> 01:48:11,817
I still remember all the
things you said to me, dad.

775
01:48:12,952 --> 01:48:16,854
Daddy, you are the one who
rescued me from that dilemma.

776
01:48:44,717 --> 01:48:45,685
Shreya, where to?

777
01:48:45,685 --> 01:48:46,845
Mum, I'll go and see him.

778
01:49:01,267 --> 01:49:02,427
It's hurting!

779
01:49:18,384 --> 01:49:20,648
I'll pack your pants
and shirts in a bag.

780
01:49:21,520 --> 01:49:22,714
Why don't you go
and visit anywhere?

781
01:49:24,724 --> 01:49:26,248
But you must come back to me!

782
01:49:27,059 --> 01:49:28,287
Leave everything behind
and come.

783
01:49:28,728 --> 01:49:29,752
Will you go?

784
01:49:35,568 --> 01:49:37,331
Both of you trusted me that much.

785
01:49:38,304 --> 01:49:39,862
And know I'll be back to
both of you!

786
01:49:40,773 --> 01:49:41,967
Both of you send me.

787
01:49:55,221 --> 01:49:57,519
Kashmir.
Srinagar.

788
01:49:59,024 --> 01:50:01,322
The days I seek my inner self.

789
01:51:20,306 --> 01:51:22,672
Shankar Menon, once
again appears in my life.

790
01:51:23,375 --> 01:51:26,811
I got to know that his son was kidnapped
when I was in Srinagar.

791
01:51:27,413 --> 01:51:29,973
I left Srinagar and came to Delhi.

792
01:52:05,384 --> 01:52:07,579
Even you asked me, dad
why I went there.

793
01:52:07,820 --> 01:52:08,878
But I don't know why.

794
01:52:09,021 --> 01:52:12,081
I felt like to accompany
him when he's in trouble.

795
01:52:17,429 --> 01:52:19,727
No, I think for sure that
I am disturbing you.

796
01:52:19,865 --> 01:52:21,594
I just came to talk for a
few minutes.

797
01:52:23,669 --> 01:52:24,636
He will be fine.

798
01:52:26,205 --> 01:52:27,638
I should have been more careful.

799
01:52:29,542 --> 01:52:32,102
He asked me to stay
with him in his house.

800
01:52:33,812 --> 01:52:35,541
Aditya, 5 years old.

801
01:52:36,615 --> 01:52:38,048
I realised hoW scared he Will be.

802
01:52:39,018 --> 01:52:40,918
I wondered why this kind of unhearted ppl
exist in this world.

803
01:52:41,954 --> 01:52:44,388
I remembered what had happen
to Meghna.

804
01:52:49,662 --> 01:52:52,859
I saw both of them were
suffering.

805
01:52:54,667 --> 01:52:57,192
The first call came
when I was around.

806
01:52:59,305 --> 01:53:00,863
They threatened for Rs2 Crores.

807
01:53:26,765 --> 01:53:28,494
I found out that the police did not
bothered about this matter.

808
01:53:29,001 --> 01:53:31,060
They didn't involved in this case seriously.

809
01:53:31,303 --> 01:53:34,761
I felt like wanted to do something.
I went into this matter.

810
01:53:39,678 --> 01:53:41,168
There is no place that l
didn't go in Delhi.

811
01:53:41,814 --> 01:53:44,180
I walked all over.
Went to every street.

812
01:53:44,984 --> 01:53:46,110
Talked to everyone.

813
01:53:46,452 --> 01:53:48,113
I talked to a thousand ppl.

814
01:53:50,456 --> 01:53:52,822
I went looking for Aditya.
An anger in me.

815
01:53:54,360 --> 01:53:57,124
We can get anything if we
get on the street.

816
01:53:57,796 --> 01:53:58,922
Whatever we wants.

817
01:53:59,531 --> 01:54:02,056
I found out that we can get
all kind of information.

818
01:54:02,568 --> 01:54:03,967
I was Iike a mad man.

819
01:54:04,436 --> 01:54:05,869
A braveness built in me.

820
01:54:06,205 --> 01:54:09,038
That's the time I changed to
someone else, dad.

821
01:54:48,480 --> 01:54:51,381
The only name that everyone
mentioned was 'Dabbu Malik'.

822
01:55:22,948 --> 01:55:26,247
I went into the effort.
Even pretended to sell girls.

823
01:56:49,001 --> 01:56:51,060
The only name that 'Dabbu Malik'
said was 'Ashat'.

824
01:57:31,243 --> 01:57:33,643
I wanted to know what
kind of life he's living.

825
01:57:34,446 --> 01:57:35,708
I followed him.

826
01:59:13,512 --> 01:59:16,743
The fierce brought me to Aditya.

827
02:00:36,895 --> 02:00:39,659
One will get the thing he wants
if he dares to get it.

828
02:00:40,265 --> 02:00:41,562
I learned that today, daddy.

829
02:01:52,938 --> 02:01:56,430
I didn't care about death that day.
But I saw it in front of my eyes.

830
02:07:22,033 --> 02:07:24,934
After that, happiness were everywhere.

831
02:07:25,437 --> 02:07:28,406
Till you fall sick, dad.

832
02:07:55,033 --> 02:07:56,557
Do it properly, Letchumi.

833
02:07:56,701 --> 02:07:58,362
Don't know how many evil eyes
had fall on him.

834
02:08:13,451 --> 02:08:15,646
After that, it was again Priya.

835
02:08:17,388 --> 02:08:18,377
I still remember.

836
02:08:19,491 --> 02:08:21,755
I stood one day and thought
about it.

837
02:08:22,961 --> 02:08:24,656
I know her since she Was

838
02:08:25,396 --> 02:08:26,920
She's Shreya's best friend.

839
02:08:27,699 --> 02:08:29,360
She will always be in our
house, dad.

840
02:08:30,835 --> 02:08:33,395
Both you and mum likes
her very much.

841
02:08:34,472 --> 02:08:36,940
You always tell me that she's
a nice girl.

842
02:09:10,074 --> 02:09:11,871
Do you watch lots of
MGR's movies?

843
02:09:14,712 --> 02:09:15,542
Why?

844
02:09:16,180 --> 02:09:17,909
You did sword fighting all.
How was that?

845
02:09:20,451 --> 02:09:22,112
What?
I'm seriously asking.

846
02:09:22,253 --> 02:09:23,117
Did you took training for that?

847
02:09:34,465 --> 02:09:36,865
I Iiked to be with her.

848
02:10:11,202 --> 02:10:13,432
I want to get down here.
Bugger!

849
02:10:19,978 --> 02:10:21,809
What?
What?

850
02:10:23,448 --> 02:10:24,278
Touch her.

851
02:10:24,482 --> 02:10:25,210
Let's go.

852
02:10:28,486 --> 02:10:29,214
Touch her now.

853
02:10:34,993 --> 02:10:36,358
Who do you think you are hitting?
- Surya, leave him.

854
02:10:36,661 --> 02:10:38,128
I'm saying no, right?

855
02:10:39,163 --> 02:10:41,290
Have you gone mad?
I'm saying no, right?

856
02:10:43,434 --> 02:10:45,595
This hit will remind you next time
before you touch any girls.

857
02:10:47,305 --> 02:10:49,364
If anything happen to him, means?
Everyone is looking at us.

858
02:10:50,208 --> 02:10:51,106
I'm going.

859
02:11:15,066 --> 02:11:18,035
I wanted her to be my
best friend only.

860
02:11:19,170 --> 02:11:20,933
Priya, shall we go?

861
02:11:28,446 --> 02:11:29,640
For a long time.

862
02:11:31,015 --> 02:11:33,279
When you were 17 and
I was 15,

863
02:11:33,851 --> 02:11:35,011
since that time.

864
02:11:39,257 --> 02:11:42,624
I met you first when I was

865
02:11:43,227 --> 02:11:44,785
May be since then also.

866
02:11:47,665 --> 02:11:49,098
No, it's ok.
You can go.

867
02:11:59,143 --> 02:12:00,735
One day, I came to tell you
about my love.

868
02:12:00,978 --> 02:12:04,505
But that was the day you told
about Meghna to everyone.

869
02:12:05,349 --> 02:12:06,611
so, I just kept quiet.

870
02:12:09,220 --> 02:12:11,711
I tried to forget you.

871
02:12:12,690 --> 02:12:13,554
I can't.

872
02:12:17,028 --> 02:12:19,292
Today, Meghna is not alive.

873
02:12:20,031 --> 02:12:21,589
I know you can't forget her.

874
02:12:24,669 --> 02:12:26,864
I'm not expecting anything from you.

875
02:12:29,841 --> 02:12:32,435
But there are such thing like
this in my heart,

876
02:12:32,910 --> 02:12:36,368
You must know that I love you.

877
02:12:37,281 --> 02:12:39,875
You must know that this is
not only friendship.

878
02:12:46,090 --> 02:12:49,617
My friends will ask me about us.

879
02:12:49,961 --> 02:12:51,360
I will tell them that we are
just friends.

880
02:12:55,600 --> 02:12:59,366
I boy and a girl can never be
always friends, right?

881
02:13:02,039 --> 02:13:03,563
I didn't tell anything to Priya, dad.

882
02:13:04,475 --> 02:13:05,908
I couldn't say yes to her.

883
02:13:07,678 --> 02:13:08,838
It's so obvious.

884
02:13:09,180 --> 02:13:10,704
Both of you not talking to
each and other.

885
02:13:10,848 --> 02:13:11,542
No, daddy.

886
02:13:12,917 --> 02:13:16,216
She is a good girl.
Say yes to her one day.

887
02:13:16,821 --> 02:13:18,345
Don't make her wait for
a long time.

888
02:13:36,140 --> 02:13:38,165
They called me Surya S/O Krishnan
that day.

889
02:13:39,110 --> 02:13:41,670
I still had the pain of losing
Meghna.

890
02:13:42,146 --> 02:13:44,580
To get rid of that,
I went into the gym.

891
02:13:45,082 --> 02:13:47,073
Till now, I tell my juniors.

892
02:13:47,485 --> 02:13:48,884
Get your body ready.

893
02:13:49,253 --> 02:13:50,777
All the pain will go.

894
02:14:16,347 --> 02:14:17,871
I want to restart my life.

895
02:14:18,282 --> 02:14:21,274
I wanted to achieve something.

896
02:14:28,025 --> 02:14:29,049
Why?

897
02:14:30,228 --> 02:14:31,593
You don't need to join army all.

898
02:14:32,930 --> 02:14:34,261
There are havocs everywhere.

899
02:14:34,665 --> 02:14:36,189
There is no peace anywhere.

900
02:14:37,068 --> 02:14:40,629
You know how deep I was thinking just
to send you to study for 4 years?

901
02:14:43,641 --> 02:14:45,438
And that boy, Venkat.

902
02:14:47,645 --> 02:14:48,634
He went from here.

903
02:14:51,716 --> 02:14:53,149
Do you know how they cried
in his funeral?

904
02:14:53,451 --> 02:14:54,850
He scarified his life for nation,
it seems.

905
02:14:56,287 --> 02:14:58,084
Was anyone sad after that?

906
02:14:58,422 --> 02:15:00,390
It was only a small news in paper.

907
02:15:03,661 --> 02:15:04,958
I'II be safe, mum.

908
02:15:05,796 --> 02:15:06,785
I want to do something.

909
02:15:08,099 --> 02:15:09,589
I'm not happy.

910
02:15:09,734 --> 02:15:11,702
I can't just sit in office.

911
02:15:12,970 --> 02:15:15,302
I always had the armed force
fascination in me.

912
02:15:16,874 --> 02:15:18,899
I didn't showed it out and I didn't
tell both of you before.

913
02:15:20,244 --> 02:15:21,233
This is what I want.

914
02:15:23,247 --> 02:15:24,441
I know for sure.

915
02:15:26,617 --> 02:15:27,447
He touched his heart.

916
02:15:27,818 --> 02:15:29,979
He touched his heart ready so
don't stop him.

917
02:15:34,892 --> 02:15:37,326
The day I saw your mum,
I touched my heart.

918
02:15:38,329 --> 02:15:40,297
My only desire is your mum.

919
02:15:43,434 --> 02:15:46,426
But it was tougher than your
army life.

920
02:15:47,438 --> 02:15:48,564
Even I myself won it.

921
02:15:49,206 --> 02:15:50,764
I'm talking seriously here.

922
02:15:54,912 --> 02:15:56,004
Let him do what he wants.

923
02:16:00,217 --> 02:16:01,377
Darling, listen to me.

924
02:18:46,383 --> 02:18:47,714
After 6 years,

925
02:18:48,486 --> 02:18:50,716
For one week, I was thinking of
talking to Priya.

926
02:18:50,988 --> 02:18:53,388
Wanted to know whether she stills
loves me or not.

927
02:18:56,427 --> 02:18:59,521
suddenly, she was walking
in front of me.

928
02:19:00,297 --> 02:19:01,992
she came for me from that far.

929
02:19:31,662 --> 02:19:33,027
I've joined the army.

930
02:19:33,197 --> 02:19:34,459
My posting is here.

931
02:19:35,466 --> 02:19:37,593
I'm going to Pakistan tomorrow
by helicopter.

932
02:19:52,716 --> 02:19:53,614
That much only?

933
02:19:54,485 --> 02:19:55,816
I can afford that much only.

934
02:19:57,755 --> 02:20:01,247
You can't stay with me here.

935
02:20:01,825 --> 02:20:03,019
Need to get higher authority's
permission.

936
02:20:06,096 --> 02:20:07,290
I will stay in hotel.

937
02:20:07,431 --> 02:20:08,898
I've already made the
arrangements.

938
02:20:10,568 --> 02:20:12,934
At times, don't behave like
a man, Priya.

939
02:20:13,537 --> 02:20:14,435
It does not suit you.

940
02:20:15,206 --> 02:20:18,107
You are a beautiful girl.
so, be like that.

941
02:20:52,876 --> 02:20:55,401
I need an answer from you.

942
02:20:56,146 --> 02:20:59,604
My mum is forcing me to
get married.

943
02:21:01,352 --> 02:21:04,185
I told her that I'll only get married
to you.

944
02:21:05,990 --> 02:21:07,514
She said cannot.

945
02:21:11,428 --> 02:21:16,525
Before I convince her, I came here to know
whether I'm in your heart or not.

946
02:21:49,800 --> 02:21:50,698
If you need anything,

947
02:22:28,238 --> 02:22:30,832
Yes, I want to lean on
your shoulder.

948
02:22:31,308 --> 02:22:32,332
I want to hug you.

949
02:22:36,513 --> 02:22:37,605
I want everything.

950
02:22:38,849 --> 02:22:40,043
But leave love aside.

951
02:22:41,785 --> 02:22:43,218
You must like me.

952
02:22:43,787 --> 02:22:45,379
But you didn't tell me
anything, Surya.

953
02:22:46,757 --> 02:22:48,281
I've been waiting for you
for 5 years.

954
02:22:49,026 --> 02:22:50,323
You didn't tell me anything.

955
02:22:51,261 --> 02:22:52,489
How can you touch me?

956
02:22:53,530 --> 02:22:55,088
Are you going to say that
you like me now?

957
02:22:56,266 --> 02:22:57,699
I don't need your sympathy.

958
02:22:57,868 --> 02:22:59,495
I can live alone throughout
my life.

959
02:23:00,003 --> 02:23:01,561
What I care if you don't love
me means?

960
02:23:05,376 --> 02:23:07,640
When today you walked into
the Academy,

961
02:23:08,278 --> 02:23:12,408
I realised a thing the moment
I saw you.

962
02:23:12,983 --> 02:23:15,349
That I really missed you a lot.

963
02:23:17,654 --> 02:23:20,282
I didn't say this just because you
tied saree today.

964
02:23:20,891 --> 02:23:21,823
I mean it.

965
02:23:31,535 --> 02:23:34,163
Meghna is no more, Priya.

966
02:23:34,872 --> 02:23:37,272
But I still have her memories.

967
02:23:38,275 --> 02:23:39,333
I want that.

968
02:23:40,043 --> 02:23:42,102
I know you won't have any
problem with that.

969
02:23:43,247 --> 02:23:45,977
For one year,
it was only you.

970
02:23:48,919 --> 02:23:52,150
I always want to talk to you,
to hear your voice.

971
02:23:52,890 --> 02:23:54,016
But something will stop me.

972
02:23:54,458 --> 02:23:57,393
I thought you won't believe me.
So, I'll just leave it.

973
02:23:59,863 --> 02:24:00,887
I tell you now.

974
02:24:04,868 --> 02:24:07,462
I want to lean on
your shoulder.

975
02:24:10,808 --> 02:24:11,900
Let's get married.

976
02:24:37,568 --> 02:24:38,694
I thought you will say no to me.

977
02:24:38,902 --> 02:24:41,393
And I wanted to go somewhere
else from here.

978
02:24:42,506 --> 02:24:45,873
I never thought you'll say yes to me
and ask me to marry you.

979
02:30:35,892 --> 02:30:37,826
Mr. Krishnan, open your mouth wide.

980
02:30:39,496 --> 02:30:40,588
Tell me where is the pain.

981
02:30:42,465 --> 02:30:44,057
It's in an advanced stage.

982
02:30:47,804 --> 02:30:49,169
It's difficult to Iive after that.

983
02:30:51,741 --> 02:30:53,606
All the happiness came to an end.

984
02:30:53,743 --> 02:30:55,108
He has a surgery option.

985
02:30:55,745 --> 02:30:58,111
We can get another 2 to 3 months
with that.

986
02:31:05,689 --> 02:31:08,249
I thought he'll face a heart problem.

987
02:31:08,525 --> 02:31:10,083
I never thought he'll get cancer.

988
02:31:12,095 --> 02:31:14,427
We can handle all that.
You all don't worry.

989
02:31:14,698 --> 02:31:15,824
Because of this.

990
02:31:16,600 --> 02:31:19,592
How many times I asked you
to stop smoking?

991
02:31:29,579 --> 02:31:31,513
Where are you going?
The key is with me.

992
02:31:33,683 --> 02:31:37,175
You changed so much within
one year.

993
02:31:38,188 --> 02:31:40,452
You will hold your head because
of pain.

994
02:31:40,824 --> 02:31:42,121
Without telling us anything.

995
02:31:43,226 --> 02:31:46,320
I think you shouldn't have done
this surgery, dad.

996
02:31:47,364 --> 02:31:48,831
You lost your voice.

997
02:31:49,266 --> 02:31:51,257
Like your neck was tied tightly.

998
02:31:52,402 --> 02:31:54,870
I couldn't see you like that, dad.

999
02:31:55,305 --> 02:31:56,795
I stayed away from you.

1000
02:31:57,073 --> 02:31:58,097
It's my fault.

1001
02:31:58,541 --> 02:31:59,974
I should have been with you.

1002
02:32:00,377 --> 02:32:02,106
I should have hold your hands
and sit with you.

1003
02:32:02,479 --> 02:32:04,538
I think I should have hug
you a lot.

1004
02:32:11,187 --> 02:32:12,677
This won't happen again, right?

1005
02:32:13,823 --> 02:32:15,757
I can never hug you again.

1006
02:32:30,273 --> 02:32:31,841
He's asking me to tell him story.

1007
02:32:31,841 --> 02:32:34,275
I could not.

1008
02:32:35,111 --> 02:32:36,772
I feel very difficult.

1009
02:32:39,849 --> 02:32:43,307
He's asking my dad to tell
him stories.

1010
02:32:44,020 --> 02:32:48,582
He feels sad that he can't talk
and tell him stories.

1011
02:32:50,226 --> 02:32:53,161
He asked me whether our son will forget
him or not when he grew up.

1012
02:32:54,264 --> 02:32:56,960
He asked us to tell about him
often to our son.

1013
02:32:58,768 --> 02:33:01,828
You tell often to our son
about him...

1014
02:33:06,543 --> 02:33:08,704
He will leave us and go, right?

1015
02:33:17,620 --> 02:33:18,746
I kept your sandals.

1016
02:33:19,589 --> 02:33:21,079
Dad, you can come with
your dhoti.

1017
02:33:25,261 --> 02:33:26,455
Dad, what happened?

1018
02:33:35,638 --> 02:33:37,105
I'm so afraid.

1019
02:33:38,308 --> 02:33:39,434
Do you really have to go?

1020
02:33:40,543 --> 02:33:42,477
Is there no one else to go
except you?

1021
02:33:47,550 --> 02:33:48,710
You must stay here.

1022
02:33:55,925 --> 02:33:57,153
Nothing will happen to him.

1023
02:33:58,061 --> 02:33:59,460
Doctor have told, right?

1024
02:34:00,030 --> 02:34:01,554
He will be fine for another 3 months.

1025
02:34:03,733 --> 02:34:04,927
I have to go.

1026
02:34:15,045 --> 02:34:16,979
The last I saw you dad was the day
before yesterday.

1027
02:34:17,213 --> 02:34:18,202
I still remember.

1028
02:34:20,817 --> 02:34:22,148
It's nothing.
You come, dad.

1029
02:34:23,053 --> 02:34:24,077
Have you packed?

1030
02:34:24,220 --> 02:34:25,915
I'II Ieave in an hour time.

1031
02:34:28,491 --> 02:34:30,686
I'll be back in 3 days.
You go and sleep.

1032
02:34:30,827 --> 02:34:32,260
I was about to come downstairs.

1033
02:34:32,395 --> 02:34:33,419
I came to say goodbye.

1034
02:34:41,271 --> 02:34:42,363
Come back fast.

1035
02:34:44,007 --> 02:34:46,908
Nothing else.
We will talk once you are back.

1036
02:34:59,155 --> 02:35:01,419
I'll come with you.
- No, you stay here.

1037
02:35:27,617 --> 02:35:29,278
I can never forget you, dad.

1038
02:35:40,029 --> 02:35:42,327
It's like I've lived my life again.

1039
02:35:42,866 --> 02:35:45,061
All this while, I never think
about all this.

1040
02:35:46,236 --> 02:35:48,067
I know you are the reason
for this.

1041
02:35:50,640 --> 02:35:51,902
Where are you, dad?

1042
02:35:53,309 --> 02:35:54,674
Don't leave me and go.

1043
02:36:50,133 --> 02:36:53,261
Journalist Namratha was kidnapped
in Jammu.

1044
02:36:53,870 --> 02:36:55,428
We are going to rescue her.

1045
02:36:55,805 --> 02:36:57,796
I didn't want to tell you that
before I left, dad.

1046
02:36:58,208 --> 02:36:59,698
Please be with me now.

1047
02:43:59,495 --> 02:44:00,757
They are going to bring
him away.

1048
02:44:12,074 --> 02:44:13,063
Careful!

1049
02:45:04,860 --> 02:45:07,385
Shreya, don't cry!

1050
02:45:12,034 --> 02:45:13,968
Surya, don't cry!

1051
02:45:15,004 --> 02:45:17,598
You must live happily after this
for your children.

1052
02:45:18,307 --> 02:45:19,831
Your dad always will say,

1053
02:45:25,081 --> 02:45:28,016
Even now, he wants you all to
laugh and be happy.

With the power of 1000 elephants,

1055

Naranan lived with that belief.
