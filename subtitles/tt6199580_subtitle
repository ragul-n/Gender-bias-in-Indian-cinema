1
00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:03,427
Over 68 million Americans

2
00:00:03,469 --> 00:00:05,976
leave the safety of
our borders every year.

3
00:00:06,195 --> 00:00:07,785
If danger strikes,

4
00:00:08,016 --> 00:00:10,574
the FBI's International Response Team

5
00:00:10,641 --> 00:00:11,998
is called into action.

6
00:00:26,696 --> 00:00:28,696
- After all this time...
- Oh-ho!

7
00:00:28,731 --> 00:00:29,743
They're finally here.

8
00:00:29,782 --> 00:00:31,094
Check it out. Here's a sample.

9
00:00:31,204 --> 00:00:33,867
Ah!

10
00:00:33,902 --> 00:00:36,178
Now that's a good looking
shirt right there, man.

11
00:00:36,249 --> 00:00:38,049
It's a dream come true is what it is.

12
00:00:38,084 --> 00:00:40,885
Hey, there's no one I'd
rather be on this journey with.

13
00:00:40,921 --> 00:00:41,652
I mean that.

14
00:00:41,687 --> 00:00:43,922
Hey, buddy, me too.

15
00:00:43,957 --> 00:00:46,724
Now, are you gonna go
with the white Range

16
00:00:46,759 --> 00:00:47,825
or the pimped out dad van?

17
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:49,560
Okay, let's sell some T-shirts first.

18
00:00:49,595 --> 00:00:51,995
Hey, I'm just saying, Davey,
is that the white Range,

19
00:00:52,031 --> 00:00:53,130
actually really nice for kids.

20
00:00:53,165 --> 00:00:54,899
Yeah, kids and freeloading friends.

21
00:00:54,934 --> 00:00:56,901
Hey, whoa, hey! Quid pro quo.

22
00:00:56,936 --> 00:00:59,837
You get the sweet ride, I will
secure the dope bachelor pad.

23
00:00:59,872 --> 00:01:01,639
See, it all works out.

24
00:01:01,674 --> 00:01:02,773
Oh, glad you got it figured out.

25
00:01:02,809 --> 00:01:03,908
Oh, yeah. Thought about this.

26
00:01:03,943 --> 00:01:05,642
Hey.

27
00:01:05,677 --> 00:01:07,945
Yes. A little something
stronger than tea.

28
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:09,813
Finally. Okay.

29
00:01:09,848 --> 00:01:11,648
A toast.

30
00:01:11,683 --> 00:01:13,016
To living the dream.

31
00:01:13,052 --> 00:01:14,517
To getting rich while trying.

32
00:01:14,553 --> 00:01:16,186
It's to get rich or die trying.

33
00:01:16,221 --> 00:01:17,654
Ah. Whatever.

34
00:01:17,689 --> 00:01:18,922
To friends.

35
00:01:18,958 --> 00:01:19,856
To friends.

36
00:01:22,794 --> 00:01:23,793
Mmm!

37
00:01:23,829 --> 00:01:25,328
- Oh, boy!
- Whoo!

38
00:01:25,363 --> 00:01:26,262
I want another!

39
00:01:26,297 --> 00:01:27,664
Let's all do another!

40
00:01:27,699 --> 00:01:29,599
Round for the entire bar, please.

41
00:01:39,543 --> 00:01:42,111
When we get to, Amar
Maayar Ghare, you will see.

42
00:01:42,146 --> 00:01:45,181
Lot of family and food.
A feast. Inshallah.

43
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:47,616
Oh, I'm not gonna lie,
brother. I can eat.

44
00:01:47,651 --> 00:01:49,218
I should call Diane
before it gets too late.

45
00:01:49,253 --> 00:01:50,886
Hey, you know what I should do, Dave?

46
00:01:50,921 --> 00:01:53,122
I should find myself a beautiful woman,

47
00:01:53,157 --> 00:01:54,690
go out and do a little dancing.

48
00:01:54,725 --> 00:01:56,324
They don't have clubs here.

49
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:59,060
That's what you say.

50
00:02:04,267 --> 00:02:05,567
Hey.

51
00:02:05,603 --> 00:02:06,535
How'd it go?

52
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:07,669
Well...

53
00:02:07,705 --> 00:02:08,871
We closed the deal.

54
00:02:08,906 --> 00:02:10,138
It's all happening, babe.

55
00:02:10,173 --> 00:02:11,406
- Oh, my God.
- We don't have to worry

56
00:02:11,441 --> 00:02:12,640
about anything anymore.

57
00:02:12,675 --> 00:02:16,044
David, I'm so incredibly proud of you.

58
00:02:16,079 --> 00:02:17,812
Hey, can I talk to our little Susie Q?

59
00:02:17,847 --> 00:02:21,149
Well, we're... we're not
calling her that, so...

60
00:02:21,184 --> 00:02:24,052
Hello, Diane?

61
00:02:24,087 --> 00:02:25,053
Yeah, no, I'm here.

62
00:02:25,088 --> 00:02:26,351
Here.

63
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:29,023
Let me hold the phone
so she can hear you.

64
00:02:29,058 --> 00:02:30,525
Say hi.

65
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,693
Hey, little one, it's your dad!

66
00:02:33,596 --> 00:02:36,063
Hey, I miss you so
much. Can you hear me?

67
00:02:36,098 --> 00:02:38,499
I can't wait to tell you
the good news face to face.

68
00:02:38,535 --> 00:02:39,834
Jamal, where are we?

69
00:02:39,869 --> 00:02:41,035
This is a short cut.

70
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:42,803
Everything okay?

71
00:02:49,478 --> 00:02:51,978
There's more of them.
What... what do they want?

72
00:02:55,117 --> 00:02:56,917
What do we do, guys? What...

73
00:02:56,952 --> 00:02:58,218
- What do we do.
- Hold on, Diane.

74
00:02:58,254 --> 00:02:59,853
Go. Drive through them.

75
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:02,221
- Go, keep driving! Go!
- Just go!

76
00:03:02,257 --> 00:03:03,256
Please!

77
00:03:05,827 --> 00:03:07,093
Okay, yeah.

78
00:03:07,128 --> 00:03:09,462
Aah!

79
00:03:09,497 --> 00:03:10,480
What do you want?!

80
00:03:10,488 --> 00:03:11,620
Ow, wait!

81
00:03:12,133 --> 00:03:13,399
Please, what do you...

82
00:03:13,435 --> 00:03:15,035
What are you doing?!

83
00:03:16,504 --> 00:03:17,970
David?

84
00:03:19,441 --> 00:03:20,806
- I'll give you money!
- Quiet!

85
00:03:20,841 --> 00:03:22,942
I'll give you money!

86
00:03:22,977 --> 00:03:25,111
David?

87
00:03:25,146 --> 00:03:27,012
David?

88
00:03:28,683 --> 00:03:30,916
No. David?

89
00:03:35,122 --> 00:03:37,155
Thank you for helping me pack.

90
00:03:37,191 --> 00:03:39,058
I can't remember the last time we moved.

91
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:41,159
Yeah, well, you always have
more stuff than you realize.

92
00:03:41,195 --> 00:03:44,029
I know, I do this every year.

93
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:48,166
What? I like to keep it fresh.

94
00:03:48,202 --> 00:03:51,169
Although I have never lived
in a house like this before.

95
00:03:51,205 --> 00:03:54,106
Yeah, well, when Brad and I got married,

96
00:03:54,141 --> 00:03:57,775
he was big on making
this place feel like ours.

97
00:03:57,811 --> 00:04:00,278
It's been almost three
years since he died,

98
00:04:00,314 --> 00:04:02,847
and I can't keep living in the past.

99
00:04:02,882 --> 00:04:06,017
Besides, if I stay any
longer, I may never leave.

100
00:04:09,723 --> 00:04:12,189
We are never gonna finish this.

101
00:04:12,225 --> 00:04:13,491
Yeah, we may need to call

102
00:04:13,526 --> 00:04:15,526
that Hot Guys moving company after all.

103
00:04:15,561 --> 00:04:17,762
No. We are not calling Simmons' friends.

104
00:04:17,797 --> 00:04:19,130
Clara, they were in the Army.

105
00:04:19,165 --> 00:04:20,832
So what?

106
00:04:20,867 --> 00:04:22,166
What does that mean? They're so hot.

107
00:04:22,201 --> 00:04:23,800
Maybe you should call them.

108
00:04:23,836 --> 00:04:25,669
Great, you're here.

109
00:04:25,704 --> 00:04:26,970
Go ahead, Monty.

110
00:04:27,006 --> 00:04:28,839
Okay, it's been
approximately eight hours

111
00:04:28,874 --> 00:04:31,041
since American entrepreneurs
David Curry and Robbie Garcia

112
00:04:31,076 --> 00:04:32,676
went missing in Bangladesh.

113
00:04:32,711 --> 00:04:34,145
They and their driver were ambushed

114
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:35,679
while David was on the
phone with his wife.

115
00:04:35,714 --> 00:04:37,148
Oh, can you imagine?

116
00:04:37,183 --> 00:04:38,715
This is their first time in country?

117
00:04:38,758 --> 00:04:40,190
Yeah, first time anywhere.

118
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:41,802
They were in Dhaka to find a factory

119
00:04:41,849 --> 00:04:44,354
for their start-up
clothing brand, Team Kings.

120
00:04:44,389 --> 00:04:46,456
It's not surprising Bangladesh
was the country of choice

121
00:04:46,491 --> 00:04:47,691
for two up and coming entrepreneurs.

122
00:04:47,726 --> 00:04:50,794
They have the fourth-fastest
growing economy in the world.

123
00:04:50,829 --> 00:04:53,396
So according to the embassy,
three foreigners were attacked

124
00:04:53,431 --> 00:04:56,065
and killed in broad daylight
by men wielding machetes

125
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,200
in the past two months.

126
00:04:57,235 --> 00:04:59,636
There's been an up tick in
violence against foreigners

127
00:04:59,671 --> 00:05:02,672
in and around Dhaka, but the abduction

128
00:05:02,707 --> 00:05:04,840
of Robbie and David doesn't fit the M.O.

129
00:05:04,876 --> 00:05:05,975
Yeah, for one, the others were

130
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:08,144
attacked and killed in the
street in broad daylight.

131
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:10,046
David and Robbie were ambushed
at night while driving.

132
00:05:10,081 --> 00:05:12,414
And abducted, which makes
me think they're still alive.

133
00:05:12,449 --> 00:05:14,183
So the question is,
why and for how long?

134
00:05:14,218 --> 00:05:15,685
So what do the local authorities say?

135
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,838
They believe this was
a robbery gone bad.

136
00:05:17,869 --> 00:05:18,988
David and Robbie were in

137
00:05:19,023 --> 00:05:20,690
the wrong place at the wrong time.

138
00:05:20,725 --> 00:05:22,825
They're expecting this to end badly.

139
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,560
Monty, what do we know
about David and Robbie?

140
00:05:24,595 --> 00:05:27,196
They're both from New
York. Huge Jets fans.

141
00:05:27,231 --> 00:05:29,598
Both in their mid-30s. David is married.

142
00:05:29,633 --> 00:05:32,167
His wife, Diane, who's pregnant,
is on the way here as we speak.

143
00:05:32,203 --> 00:05:34,069
Uh, Robbie is your
prototypical bachelor,

144
00:05:34,104 --> 00:05:35,204
according to social media.

145
00:05:35,239 --> 00:05:36,705
And what about this driver?

146
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:37,673
His name is Jamal Muti.

147
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:39,074
And other than the
fact that he's missing,

148
00:05:39,109 --> 00:05:40,275
I know very little.

149
00:05:40,311 --> 00:05:42,277
So is Jamal a victim, as well?

150
00:05:42,313 --> 00:05:44,045
Or did he set them up?

151
00:05:44,081 --> 00:05:46,347
We've got a lot of unknowns here.

152
00:05:48,085 --> 00:05:51,452
As with most abductions, the
first 24 hours are crucial.

153
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:53,354
So when we land, we
need to work quickly.

154
00:05:53,389 --> 00:05:56,825
Robbie and David's lives depend on it.

155
00:05:57,738 --> 00:06:00,762
We turned right, back
towards the city, I think.

156
00:06:00,797 --> 00:06:01,873
I don't... I don't know.

157
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,365
- We got to get out of here.
- We don't know where here is.

158
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,100
Robbie, they're gonna kill us.

159
00:06:06,135 --> 00:06:08,536
If they wanted us dead, we'd be dead.

160
00:06:11,474 --> 00:06:12,340
You guilty.

161
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:14,208
Stop, please! Why are you doing this?

162
00:06:14,244 --> 00:06:15,443
- Dave?
- Why are you doing this?!

163
00:06:17,413 --> 00:06:18,612
- I don't know.
- Guilty!

164
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:21,281
Oh, God!

165
00:06:21,316 --> 00:06:22,482
Robbie!

166
00:06:44,747 --> 00:06:47,182
"The small truth has
words which are clear.

167
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:49,144
The great truth has great silence."

168
00:06:49,161 --> 00:06:50,364
R. Tagore.

169
00:07:12,538 --> 00:07:14,337
Hope I'm doing this right.

170
00:07:14,405 --> 00:07:16,752
Oh, it's the gesture that counts.

171
00:07:17,524 --> 00:07:19,524
You know, Bangladesh
has one of the worst

172
00:07:19,559 --> 00:07:21,659
police-to-civilian ratios in the world.

173
00:07:21,695 --> 00:07:23,928
In a country that's 162 million people,

174
00:07:23,963 --> 00:07:27,264
there's only 150,000 officers.

175
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,700
I spoke with Sergeant Bhaduri,

176
00:07:29,735 --> 00:07:32,436
and he agreed to be our escort.

177
00:07:36,209 --> 00:07:37,641
Man, you weren't kidding.

178
00:07:37,676 --> 00:07:39,543
This place is a ghost town.

179
00:07:39,578 --> 00:07:41,011
Yeah, well, their economy is growing

180
00:07:41,047 --> 00:07:42,679
faster than their infrastructure.

181
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:49,319
My apologies. I'm Constable Hoque.

182
00:07:49,355 --> 00:07:50,520
You are Jack Garrett?

183
00:07:50,556 --> 00:07:52,356
Yes. And this is my team,

184
00:07:52,391 --> 00:07:54,458
Agents Seger, Simmons, and Jarvis.

185
00:07:54,493 --> 00:07:56,125
Sergeant-da Bhaduri is away.

186
00:07:56,161 --> 00:07:58,661
There was a haartal...
Strike in Farmgate.

187
00:07:58,696 --> 00:08:00,129
We are most busy.

188
00:08:00,165 --> 00:08:02,198
Please, this way.

189
00:08:04,502 --> 00:08:06,135
With the demands on the department,

190
00:08:06,171 --> 00:08:07,636
we have not made much
progress on the case

191
00:08:07,672 --> 00:08:08,537
of the missing Americans.

192
00:08:08,573 --> 00:08:13,076
But, uh, it is okay with us you start.

193
00:08:13,111 --> 00:08:15,478
You can work in this area.

194
00:08:15,513 --> 00:08:17,413
I'm the only one here, so I must stay,

195
00:08:17,448 --> 00:08:19,482
but Sergeant-da Bhaduri
will join you when he can.

196
00:08:19,517 --> 00:08:20,716
Thank you.

197
00:08:20,752 --> 00:08:21,817
Oh.

198
00:08:21,853 --> 00:08:24,854
We have an address for the
missing driver, Jamal Muti.

199
00:08:24,889 --> 00:08:28,023
No one has gone to see yet.

200
00:08:28,058 --> 00:08:29,525
You go, okay?

201
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,559
Thank you.

202
00:08:32,897 --> 00:08:34,863
Guess we're on our own.

203
00:08:34,899 --> 00:08:36,831
Yeah, well, until the last decade or so,

204
00:08:36,867 --> 00:08:38,934
few locals traveled
and ever fewer tourists

205
00:08:38,969 --> 00:08:40,068
visited Bangladesh.

206
00:08:40,104 --> 00:08:42,871
And without an escort,
communication may be an issue.

207
00:08:42,907 --> 00:08:45,440
Well, let's not let it get in our way.

208
00:08:45,475 --> 00:08:47,509
I want us working
forwards and backwards.

209
00:08:47,544 --> 00:08:49,544
We need to determine if David and Robbie

210
00:08:49,579 --> 00:08:52,246
were targeted or if their abduction

211
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:53,915
was a crime of opportunity.

212
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,116
Okay, I got Monty.

213
00:08:55,151 --> 00:08:57,886
- Monty?
- I'm here.

214
00:08:57,921 --> 00:09:00,588
David was on the phone
when they were abducted.

215
00:09:00,624 --> 00:09:02,390
See what you can pull
from the phone company.

216
00:09:02,426 --> 00:09:04,625
And let us know what you
learn from David's wife.

217
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:07,428
Copy, but just a head's up,
the cellular network in Dhaka

218
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:08,462
is a bit antiquated,

219
00:09:08,497 --> 00:09:10,097
so I have to work
backwards through the logs.

220
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:11,799
It may take me some
time, but I'll do my best.

221
00:09:11,834 --> 00:09:13,367
Great.

222
00:09:13,403 --> 00:09:15,636
Simmons and Mae, track down Jamal.

223
00:09:15,671 --> 00:09:17,571
If he was taken along
with Davey and Robbie,

224
00:09:17,606 --> 00:09:20,541
we need to find out why.

225
00:09:20,576 --> 00:09:22,443
Clara, let's you and I
focus on what we can learn

226
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:25,245
about the guys before they went missing.

227
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,147
Well, they settled a
bill just minutes before

228
00:09:27,182 --> 00:09:29,716
they were abducted at
a local ex-pat club.

229
00:09:29,752 --> 00:09:32,118
We'll start there.

230
00:09:34,356 --> 00:09:36,222
Oh, thank you.

231
00:09:36,258 --> 00:09:38,758
David and Robbie, they've been
friends since grade school,

232
00:09:38,793 --> 00:09:40,560
and they've worked
with various designers

233
00:09:40,595 --> 00:09:41,394
and clothing companies.

234
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:42,628
And it was always dream of theirs

235
00:09:42,664 --> 00:09:43,763
to launch their own brand.

236
00:09:43,798 --> 00:09:45,665
And this year, they finally
got the money together.

237
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,267
Mm-hmm. The trip to Bangladesh,

238
00:09:47,302 --> 00:09:48,801
it was the final piece of the puzzle.

239
00:09:48,837 --> 00:09:53,139
I mean, their company's initial
valuation was $5 million.

240
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:55,608
That's a lot of money at stake,
so they wanted to be there

241
00:09:55,643 --> 00:09:56,776
to personally select their supplier.

242
00:09:56,811 --> 00:09:59,745
So David handled the business,
and Robbie was the artist?

243
00:09:59,781 --> 00:10:01,981
Yes. Yeah. I mean, they
designed street wear

244
00:10:02,016 --> 00:10:05,618
like Obey or Supreme, and...

245
00:10:07,121 --> 00:10:08,588
Sorry.

246
00:10:08,623 --> 00:10:10,655
David, I mean, he
didn't even want to go.

247
00:10:10,691 --> 00:10:15,327
I'm... I'm due in a week,
and this is his dream.

248
00:10:15,363 --> 00:10:17,496
And with the little one coming,
I mean, we just, we couldn't

249
00:10:17,531 --> 00:10:20,932
let an opportunity like this pass by.

250
00:10:20,968 --> 00:10:23,135
Um...

251
00:10:24,372 --> 00:10:28,339
I made copies of everything,
their visas, their itinerary,

252
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:29,674
the letter of invitation.

253
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:31,510
Letter of invitation?

254
00:10:31,545 --> 00:10:32,978
In order to do business in Bangladesh,

255
00:10:33,013 --> 00:10:36,280
you have to be invited
by a local company.

256
00:10:36,316 --> 00:10:38,650
This is very helpful.

257
00:10:40,053 --> 00:10:41,853
We're gonna get to the bottom of this.

258
00:10:41,889 --> 00:10:43,221
Okay?

259
00:10:43,256 --> 00:10:45,490
And... and whatever you need, I'm here.

260
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:57,035
Were you working last night?

261
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:58,836
Yeah. Uh, I was.

262
00:10:58,871 --> 00:11:00,170
Do you recognize these two?

263
00:11:00,205 --> 00:11:02,673
Yeah. Um, they were cool guys.

264
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:04,408
Um, Americans.

265
00:11:04,443 --> 00:11:06,043
They were celebrating some kind of deal

266
00:11:06,078 --> 00:11:07,645
they'd just closed on a clothing line.

267
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,580
Were they waiting for anyone?

268
00:11:09,615 --> 00:11:12,016
Did you notice anything
unusual about them?

269
00:11:12,051 --> 00:11:15,519
No. Um, they bought a round
of shots for the whole bar.

270
00:11:15,555 --> 00:11:17,654
I mean, like I said, nice guys.

271
00:11:17,689 --> 00:11:20,524
They, um, even gave me one
of their T-shirts, actually.

272
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:21,324
Do you still have it?

273
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,060
Yeah, um, I think it's in the back.

274
00:11:23,095 --> 00:11:24,928
I can show you.

275
00:11:24,963 --> 00:11:25,929
It's Monty.

276
00:11:25,964 --> 00:11:27,234
You go.

277
00:11:29,601 --> 00:11:30,867
Hey, Monty, what do you got?

278
00:11:30,902 --> 00:11:31,935
Not sure just yet.

279
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:33,703
But it turns out, in order to obtain

280
00:11:33,738 --> 00:11:36,072
a business visa in Bangladesh,
David and Robbie had to be

281
00:11:36,107 --> 00:11:38,708
invited by a local company, Toj.

282
00:11:38,743 --> 00:11:40,209
Now, Toj sponsored their trip to Dhaka,

283
00:11:40,244 --> 00:11:42,178
they paid for the plane
ticket, hotel, et cetera.

284
00:11:42,213 --> 00:11:43,379
But Toj is in trouble.

285
00:11:43,414 --> 00:11:45,448
The deal with the Americans
would have had a huge impact

286
00:11:45,483 --> 00:11:46,115
on their bottom line.

287
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:47,249
In fact, they had taken out

288
00:11:47,285 --> 00:11:49,185
a line of credit on
speculation of future earnings.

289
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:51,753
Okay, just send us
everything you can, all right?

290
00:11:51,789 --> 00:11:52,788
Will do.

291
00:11:52,823 --> 00:11:53,889
Thanks.

292
00:11:55,826 --> 00:11:59,095
Can I buy you a drink?

293
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:00,262
Jeffery Khan. Hi.

294
00:12:00,298 --> 00:12:02,764
Hi. Clara Seger.

295
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,101
I'm actually here on business.

296
00:12:05,136 --> 00:12:07,636
The disappearance of two Americans.

297
00:12:07,671 --> 00:12:08,536
How did you know that?

298
00:12:08,572 --> 00:12:09,571
It's my job to know.

299
00:12:09,607 --> 00:12:11,940
And I saw you flash your
badge to the bartender.

300
00:12:11,976 --> 00:12:14,442
Ah. You are a journalist.

301
00:12:14,478 --> 00:12:16,778
Yeah. For the BBC.

302
00:12:16,814 --> 00:12:19,114
And you're here with
the FBI, I'm guessing.

303
00:12:19,149 --> 00:12:20,082
Yes.

304
00:12:20,117 --> 00:12:21,917
A woman with a gun.

305
00:12:21,952 --> 00:12:24,419
Uh, yes, and I'm not afraid to use it.

306
00:12:24,454 --> 00:12:26,187
I like that.

307
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:29,624
Um...

308
00:12:29,659 --> 00:12:31,126
Excuse me.

309
00:12:32,962 --> 00:12:34,562
So, it looks like the shirts were

310
00:12:34,598 --> 00:12:37,432
David and Robbie's final piece
of business before heading here.

311
00:12:37,467 --> 00:12:40,001
I probably could track
down a manufacturer,

312
00:12:40,036 --> 00:12:42,236
but there's no RN number,

313
00:12:42,271 --> 00:12:44,071
just this inscription in Bengali.

314
00:12:44,107 --> 00:12:47,074
I don't mean to interrupt,
but no tracking number

315
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:49,510
usually means it's a
bootleg or a sample.

316
00:12:49,545 --> 00:12:53,614
Um, Jack, this is
Jeffery Khan from the BBC.

317
00:12:54,488 --> 00:12:56,121
May I?

318
00:13:00,122 --> 00:13:02,856
Yeah, there's an inscription
here, at the seam.

319
00:13:02,891 --> 00:13:03,990
Tiger Industries.

320
00:13:04,026 --> 00:13:05,859
They're up on Hazaribagh.

321
00:13:05,894 --> 00:13:07,827
And the owner's called Hasan.

322
00:13:09,898 --> 00:13:10,997
Thank you.

323
00:13:11,033 --> 00:13:12,265
Another time.

324
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,800
Perhaps?

325
00:13:15,871 --> 00:13:18,204
Jack, Monty said a company called Toj

326
00:13:18,239 --> 00:13:20,506
paid for their trip,
not Tiger Industries.

327
00:13:20,542 --> 00:13:23,043
So they were being wooed by one company

328
00:13:23,078 --> 00:13:25,311
and chose to do business with another.

329
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:28,181
Yeah, so if David and Robbie
backed out at the last minute,

330
00:13:28,216 --> 00:13:30,015
we're talking about a lot of money.

331
00:13:30,051 --> 00:13:33,286
I mean, the owner of Toj
would certainly have motive.

332
00:13:33,321 --> 00:13:34,687
Motive enough to kidnap?

333
00:13:34,722 --> 00:13:35,954
Maybe enough to kill.

334
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:37,657
Let's find out.

335
00:13:51,772 --> 00:13:53,839
Police!

336
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:55,808
Jamal Muti?

337
00:14:02,683 --> 00:14:05,684
Here's an unopened paycheck.

338
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:07,552
Looks like Jamal worked for Toj.

339
00:14:07,588 --> 00:14:09,588
Their local sponsor.

340
00:14:27,941 --> 00:14:29,440
Don't even think about it!

341
00:14:29,475 --> 00:14:32,777
Jamal? Are you Jamal Muti?

342
00:14:32,812 --> 00:14:35,912
Hold still. Move your hand. Move it.

343
00:14:39,418 --> 00:14:40,517
Here.

344
00:14:42,488 --> 00:14:43,920
It's not him.

345
00:14:43,956 --> 00:14:46,423
This is Tokay.

346
00:14:46,459 --> 00:14:48,859
Bad move, Tokay.

347
00:14:54,432 --> 00:14:55,899
The ready-made garment industry

348
00:14:55,934 --> 00:14:58,368
is about as cutthroat as it gets.

349
00:14:58,403 --> 00:15:00,436
Sweatshops like this are common.

350
00:15:00,472 --> 00:15:02,906
Suppliers are locked
in a race to the bottom

351
00:15:02,941 --> 00:15:05,909
while international corporations
struggle to improve sales.

352
00:15:05,944 --> 00:15:08,711
Yep, anything goes. According to Monty,

353
00:15:08,747 --> 00:15:10,446
the owner of Toj, Niklas Poulsen,

354
00:15:10,482 --> 00:15:12,948
has had more than one
brush with controversy.

355
00:15:12,984 --> 00:15:15,785
Yeah, under-aged workers,
unsafe work environments.

356
00:15:16,888 --> 00:15:19,489
If David and Robbie chose
to do business elsewhere,

357
00:15:19,524 --> 00:15:20,256
I can see why.

358
00:15:20,292 --> 00:15:21,624
That was Mae.

359
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:22,958
Jamal may be trouble.

360
00:15:22,994 --> 00:15:24,293
He works for Toj.

361
00:15:24,328 --> 00:15:26,595
Poulsen's failed before.

362
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:28,130
And there's more than money on the line.

363
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:29,965
His legacy is at stake.

364
00:15:30,001 --> 00:15:32,868
No questions, just do it.

365
00:15:35,673 --> 00:15:36,705
Mr. Poulsen?

366
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:39,508
Is the FBI here to investigate
the thieving Americans

367
00:15:39,543 --> 00:15:41,075
who defrauded me and ran?

368
00:15:41,111 --> 00:15:44,846
I'm Unit Chief Jack Garrett,
this is SSA Clara Seger.

369
00:15:44,881 --> 00:15:47,949
David Curry and his partner
are in breach of contract.

370
00:15:47,984 --> 00:15:50,118
I already instructed my
lawyers to file a suit.

371
00:15:50,153 --> 00:15:52,587
Mr. Poulsen, are you
aware that David and Robbie

372
00:15:52,623 --> 00:15:56,024
have been abducted and
are currently missing?

373
00:15:56,059 --> 00:15:58,092
I spent thousands of
dollars bringing them here

374
00:15:58,128 --> 00:16:00,028
and made all the introductions,
laid the groundwork...

375
00:16:00,063 --> 00:16:01,129
Everything.

376
00:16:01,164 --> 00:16:02,831
And they showed me the door.

377
00:16:02,866 --> 00:16:05,266
So, no, I can't say I'm
shocked they got into

378
00:16:05,302 --> 00:16:06,434
some kind of trouble.

379
00:16:06,469 --> 00:16:07,936
When's the last time you saw them?

380
00:16:07,971 --> 00:16:10,305
Does this mean I'm not
going to get back my money?

381
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:12,841
How long has Jamal Muti worked for you?

382
00:16:12,876 --> 00:16:14,172
Jamal?

383
00:16:14,258 --> 00:16:15,175
I fired him.

384
00:16:15,211 --> 00:16:16,276
When?

385
00:16:16,312 --> 00:16:17,611
A few days ago.

386
00:16:17,647 --> 00:16:19,847
He's the one who undercut me.

387
00:16:19,882 --> 00:16:21,882
Fixed the Americans up
with one of my competitors,

388
00:16:21,917 --> 00:16:22,683
stole my finder's fee

389
00:16:22,719 --> 00:16:24,652
and percentage of future earnings.

390
00:16:24,687 --> 00:16:26,220
Do you know where he is now?

391
00:16:26,255 --> 00:16:28,021
You know he has a record.

392
00:16:28,057 --> 00:16:29,957
Priors for theft and assault.

393
00:16:29,992 --> 00:16:33,060
He knows better than to show
his face around here again.

394
00:16:33,095 --> 00:16:34,862
If it's Jamal you're
after, I can't help you.

395
00:16:34,897 --> 00:16:38,065
Mr. Poulsen, we'll need a
copy of Jamal's personnel file

396
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,867
and employment history.

397
00:16:39,902 --> 00:16:41,668
I don't have those records on hand.

398
00:16:41,703 --> 00:16:43,036
Then make a call.

399
00:16:43,072 --> 00:16:44,938
Find someone who does.

400
00:16:50,679 --> 00:16:52,044
Kutcha, get me Jamal Muti's file.

401
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,880
What a piece of work.

402
00:16:53,915 --> 00:16:55,014
Classic narcissist.

403
00:16:55,049 --> 00:16:55,948
Yeah.

404
00:16:55,984 --> 00:16:57,917
Even still, I don't
think he was involved

405
00:16:57,952 --> 00:16:59,352
in David and Robbie's abduction.

406
00:16:59,388 --> 00:17:01,421
I mean, he foolishly
confirmed his own motive

407
00:17:01,456 --> 00:17:03,055
before he even knew why we were here.

408
00:17:03,091 --> 00:17:05,091
And he already has a plan
of action to deal with them.

409
00:17:05,126 --> 00:17:06,092
I agree.

410
00:17:06,127 --> 00:17:07,693
He's not behind this.

411
00:17:07,728 --> 00:17:09,228
But if Poulsen fired him,

412
00:17:09,264 --> 00:17:12,698
why was Jamal still driving
David and Robbie around.

413
00:17:12,733 --> 00:17:14,600
Go ahead, Simmons.

414
00:17:14,635 --> 00:17:16,668
Hey, Jack, so we did not find Jamal,

415
00:17:16,704 --> 00:17:17,669
but we did learn something interesting.

416
00:17:17,705 --> 00:17:20,005
Yeah, Jamal is in some
pretty serious debt.

417
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,908
He recently took out a loan
with a local gang leader,

418
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:25,110
and his creditor just came collecting.

419
00:17:25,145 --> 00:17:26,912
We arrested a man named
Tokay, who said he was hired

420
00:17:26,947 --> 00:17:29,214
to scare Jamal into.
Making his payments on time.

421
00:17:29,249 --> 00:17:31,717
Who does Tokay work for?

422
00:17:31,752 --> 00:17:33,952
Well, Constable Hoque
thinks he's just a hired gun.

423
00:17:33,987 --> 00:17:35,687
He works for whoever's
paying him this week.

424
00:17:35,723 --> 00:17:37,722
Yeah, this whole thing might
come down to the fact that

425
00:17:37,757 --> 00:17:40,892
Jamal owes some big money
to some pretty bad men.

426
00:17:40,928 --> 00:17:43,461
So David and Robbie just got
caught in the cross hairs.

427
00:17:43,496 --> 00:17:44,462
Right, and that's not all.

428
00:17:44,497 --> 00:17:46,064
Monty came through. With
the cell tower records,

429
00:17:46,099 --> 00:17:47,698
so we're headed to where he thinks

430
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:49,367
is the primary abduction site right now.

431
00:17:49,403 --> 00:17:50,302
Great. Go.

432
00:17:50,337 --> 00:17:52,904
We'll catch up with
you as soon as we can.

433
00:17:56,108 --> 00:17:57,975
Just get him to talk with us.

434
00:17:58,010 --> 00:17:59,777
Figure out what he wants.

435
00:17:59,813 --> 00:18:02,647
Davey, he's crazy.

436
00:18:02,682 --> 00:18:04,916
We're not gonna be able to
talk our way out of this.

437
00:18:08,187 --> 00:18:10,387
What if we never make it back?

438
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:12,122
I... I don't get to meet my baby girl.

439
00:18:12,158 --> 00:18:14,458
Hey, don't talk like that.

440
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:18,562
That family of yours is counting on you.

441
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:21,598
The next time he comes in here...

442
00:18:21,633 --> 00:18:23,633
I'll distract him.

443
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:24,668
How?

444
00:18:24,703 --> 00:18:26,135
I don't know.

445
00:18:26,171 --> 00:18:27,804
But I'll figure something out.

446
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,306
But you got to run.

447
00:18:30,342 --> 00:18:33,109
I'm not leaving here without you.

448
00:18:33,144 --> 00:18:36,980
I wasn't planning on staying behind.

449
00:18:37,015 --> 00:18:39,483
I'm gonna knock the son of a bitch out.

450
00:18:42,954 --> 00:18:45,989
Like Kenny Tullo in the sixth grade.

451
00:18:46,024 --> 00:18:49,225
Yeah, exactly like Kenny Tullo.

452
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:53,196
Hey...

453
00:18:53,231 --> 00:18:54,998
See if you can kick one of those...

454
00:18:55,033 --> 00:18:57,300
one of those rocks loose.

455
00:19:25,762 --> 00:19:27,562
This is miles from their hotel.

456
00:19:27,597 --> 00:19:29,331
Yeah, why would Jamal
take David and Robbie

457
00:19:29,366 --> 00:19:30,698
so far off the beaten path?

458
00:19:30,734 --> 00:19:32,500
Where were they going?

459
00:19:33,737 --> 00:19:37,104
Makes me think they had some
sort of specific plan or agenda.

460
00:19:42,546 --> 00:19:44,045
Mae...

461
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,312
I got a body.

462
00:19:52,621 --> 00:19:54,321
It's Jamal.

463
00:19:59,749 --> 00:20:01,109
Well, based on the
decomp, I would say that

464
00:20:01,155 --> 00:20:02,927
Jamal was killed 48 hours ago.

465
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:05,307
Approximately the same time
David and Robbie went missing.

466
00:20:05,342 --> 00:20:07,409
Yeah. Jamal's carotid was severed.

467
00:20:07,444 --> 00:20:08,676
Mostly likely with a machete.

468
00:20:08,712 --> 00:20:10,512
This is someone with a lot of rage.

469
00:20:10,547 --> 00:20:13,248
And these defensive wounds
show that he fought back.

470
00:20:13,283 --> 00:20:15,683
All right, so did. The
gangsters that Jamal owed,

471
00:20:15,726 --> 00:20:18,095
did they get a lead
on him, track him down,

472
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:19,009
and then just kill him?

473
00:20:19,072 --> 00:20:22,456
But why? They wanted
Jamal's money, not him dead.

474
00:20:22,492 --> 00:20:24,425
And setting that aside for a moment,

475
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:25,827
why even take David and Robbie?

476
00:20:25,862 --> 00:20:27,194
They were witnesses.

477
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:29,330
Why not just kill them on the spot?

478
00:20:29,365 --> 00:20:31,499
David and Robbie had
nothing to do with this.

479
00:20:31,534 --> 00:20:32,967
Why keep them alive at all?

480
00:20:33,003 --> 00:20:35,103
There is another option.

481
00:20:35,138 --> 00:20:37,939
Jamal brought them out here
looking for his own payday.

482
00:20:37,974 --> 00:20:39,039
He arranged for their kidnapping,

483
00:20:39,074 --> 00:20:39,940
sold them for ransom.

484
00:20:39,975 --> 00:20:42,042
But what happened, he's dead?

485
00:20:42,077 --> 00:20:43,210
Doesn't make any sense.

486
00:20:43,246 --> 00:20:45,812
Yeah, well, neither does the
idea that whoever attacked

487
00:20:45,848 --> 00:20:48,849
them took David and Robbie.

488
00:20:48,884 --> 00:20:51,418
What if Jamal wasn't the target?

489
00:20:52,821 --> 00:20:54,721
If this is about David and Robbie,

490
00:20:54,757 --> 00:20:57,624
this location is ideal for
some kind of snatch and grab.

491
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:00,326
It's isolated, natural choke point.

492
00:21:00,362 --> 00:21:02,462
Yeah, he could have been spotted
anywhere and followed out here.

493
00:21:02,497 --> 00:21:04,865
Need to find out who ambushed him.

494
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:07,567
Most of the street violence
here in Dhaka is pinned on

495
00:21:07,602 --> 00:21:10,236
the local warring games and
Mastaans, or crime bosses,

496
00:21:10,272 --> 00:21:12,972
including the recent
attacks on foreigners.

497
00:21:13,007 --> 00:21:14,507
Much like their North
American counterparts,

498
00:21:14,543 --> 00:21:17,577
they're into everything...
Human trafficking, alcohol,

499
00:21:17,612 --> 00:21:18,978
drugs, land grabbing.

500
00:21:19,013 --> 00:21:20,046
Hey, Jack.

501
00:21:20,081 --> 00:21:23,683
Monty, I know she's
pregnant, but I think we need

502
00:21:23,718 --> 00:21:25,818
to take Diane through
a cognitive interview.

503
00:21:25,853 --> 00:21:26,719
She'll do anything to help.

504
00:21:26,754 --> 00:21:28,420
She said she's tougher than she looks.

505
00:21:28,455 --> 00:21:29,922
Yeah, all mothers are.

506
00:21:29,957 --> 00:21:31,724
See if she can recall
the men who attacked them.

507
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:34,894
We think that David
and Robbie, not Jamal,

508
00:21:34,929 --> 00:21:36,696
are the original targets.

509
00:21:36,731 --> 00:21:38,698
Hey, can you come in here, please?

510
00:21:38,733 --> 00:21:40,766
Why won't you help us?

511
00:21:40,802 --> 00:21:43,268
Please. He needs help.

512
00:21:43,304 --> 00:21:46,071
Quiet! Please.

513
00:21:49,142 --> 00:21:50,875
Run, David, run!

514
00:21:50,911 --> 00:21:52,578
- Now!
- Come on!

515
00:21:52,613 --> 00:21:53,612
- Go.
- I won't leave without you!

516
00:21:55,249 --> 00:21:57,015
Oh!

517
00:21:57,050 --> 00:21:59,084
Oh, Robbie, no!

518
00:22:02,388 --> 00:22:04,923
Ugh!

519
00:22:06,593 --> 00:22:07,826
No, no!

520
00:22:10,797 --> 00:22:14,199
And then Robbie yelled.

521
00:22:14,234 --> 00:22:17,435
And then they argued.

522
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:19,637
Who? The attackers?

523
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,721
We can take a break.

524
00:22:37,757 --> 00:22:40,157
No. No, I'm fine.

525
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:41,514
Um...

526
00:22:41,577 --> 00:22:42,626
And then there was a third voice.

527
00:22:42,661 --> 00:22:43,961
And they kept saying...

528
00:22:46,165 --> 00:22:49,566
... "Dost Mehbani rahmat Karo."

529
00:22:49,601 --> 00:22:52,636
And then it got mu...

530
00:22:52,671 --> 00:22:54,604
Muffled, like they were...

531
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,440
like they were dragging a Bo... a body.

532
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:01,678
Oh, my God.

533
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:02,670
Is...

534
00:23:02,741 --> 00:23:04,648
Is he dead because...

535
00:23:04,683 --> 00:23:05,482
Okay, deep breaths.

536
00:23:05,517 --> 00:23:07,784
- I can't.
- Deep breaths.

537
00:23:10,221 --> 00:23:13,689
We don't know what happened yet.

538
00:23:13,724 --> 00:23:15,992
We're gonna find him, okay?

539
00:23:16,027 --> 00:23:17,860
Yeah.

540
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:18,995
Yeah.

541
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:22,865
Simmons, Mae, see what kind of file

542
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:25,301
the station has on Jamal
and find out when his family

543
00:23:25,336 --> 00:23:26,502
is supposed to arrive.

544
00:23:26,537 --> 00:23:29,471
We need to start narrowing
down some answers, and fast.

545
00:23:30,874 --> 00:23:33,403
Hey, Monty, tell us you
have something for us.

546
00:23:33,434 --> 00:23:36,845
Yeah, does the phrase,
"Dough Mehbani Rahmat care-o"

547
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,047
or "Karo" mean anything to you?

548
00:23:39,082 --> 00:23:40,949
Diane recalled hearing
it in the argument.

549
00:23:40,984 --> 00:23:43,618
I tried to translate it to
Bengali, but nothing came up.

550
00:23:43,653 --> 00:23:45,987
"Dost meherbani rahmat Karo."

551
00:23:46,023 --> 00:23:47,055
It's an Urdu phrase.

552
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:50,391
It means, uh, "Friend, have mercy."

553
00:23:50,427 --> 00:23:52,660
Sounds like they
weren't on the same page.

554
00:23:52,696 --> 00:23:55,197
If their abductors fought,
it suggests that this wasn't

555
00:23:55,232 --> 00:23:57,164
as organized as we originally thought.

556
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,733
Well, it's also unusual.

557
00:23:58,768 --> 00:24:01,336
98% of the population
speak Bengali, not Urdu.

558
00:24:01,371 --> 00:24:03,838
So...

559
00:24:03,873 --> 00:24:06,341
is there...

560
00:24:06,376 --> 00:24:09,877
a particular neighborhood
in Dhaka that's home

561
00:24:09,912 --> 00:24:12,413
to a large Urdu-speaking population?

562
00:24:12,449 --> 00:24:15,216
In a city of 17 million that
used to be ruled by Pakistan,

563
00:24:15,251 --> 00:24:18,752
I'm sure there's more than a few.

564
00:24:18,787 --> 00:24:20,221
I know who can help us.

565
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,692
I don't like reporters.

566
00:24:25,728 --> 00:24:26,560
We can't just sit around

567
00:24:26,595 --> 00:24:28,262
waiting for Sergeant Bhaduri to show up.

568
00:24:28,297 --> 00:24:30,864
We need local Intel.

569
00:24:30,899 --> 00:24:32,566
Monty could run a background on him.

570
00:24:32,601 --> 00:24:35,736
I already had him do it.

571
00:24:35,771 --> 00:24:37,704
Jeffery's clean.

572
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:38,772
Well-respected.

573
00:24:38,807 --> 00:24:41,441
He's been stationed in Dhaka
for the past five years.

574
00:24:41,477 --> 00:24:44,177
Well, places like this
are information economies.

575
00:24:44,212 --> 00:24:45,912
It's all about who you
know, and I'm willing to bet.

576
00:24:45,947 --> 00:24:47,780
Jeffery knows who we
should be talking to.

577
00:24:47,815 --> 00:24:51,217
So what makes you think
he'll help us off the record?

578
00:24:51,253 --> 00:24:52,919
He'll help us.

579
00:25:03,398 --> 00:25:05,898
This isn't a social call, is it?

580
00:25:05,933 --> 00:25:08,434
Listen, we believe, the
Americans were abducted

581
00:25:08,469 --> 00:25:10,870
by a local gang...
Urdu-speaking with the means

582
00:25:10,905 --> 00:25:13,706
and the resources. To
grab and hold two adult men

583
00:25:13,741 --> 00:25:14,964
for a number of days.

584
00:25:15,027 --> 00:25:16,642
Look, I'm not looking to get involved

585
00:25:16,677 --> 00:25:17,810
in a criminal investigation.

586
00:25:17,845 --> 00:25:20,645
You'd rather stand back and
write about the aftermath?

587
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:23,982
Trust is my most valuable
resource as a journalist.

588
00:25:24,018 --> 00:25:26,952
If I start bringing the FBI
to the doorstep of my assets,

589
00:25:26,987 --> 00:25:29,754
I could throw any credibility
I have out the window.

590
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:31,390
People's lives are at stake.

591
00:25:31,425 --> 00:25:33,725
We are trying to prevent a
tragedy before it happens.

592
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,894
I understand your dilemma,
but this isn't a game.

593
00:25:35,929 --> 00:25:37,261
These are people's lives.

594
00:25:37,297 --> 00:25:39,130
Look, I mean, you could start

595
00:25:39,165 --> 00:25:41,666
in the Banasri Ullah Para neighborhood.

596
00:25:41,701 --> 00:25:43,802
It's home to a large
Urdu-speaking population.

597
00:25:43,837 --> 00:25:46,304
No. We need more than that.

598
00:25:46,339 --> 00:25:47,839
There are roughly a million people

599
00:25:47,874 --> 00:25:48,907
in those few square blocks.

600
00:25:48,942 --> 00:25:52,243
Look, right now, there are
two men in grave danger.

601
00:25:52,278 --> 00:25:54,478
They both have families
back home that are praying

602
00:25:54,513 --> 00:25:56,447
for a miracle, and
they are counting on us.

603
00:25:56,482 --> 00:25:58,416
We don't have the luxury or time

604
00:25:58,451 --> 00:26:00,684
to worry about the future
or our damn credibility.

605
00:26:00,719 --> 00:26:03,587
What we need is Intel,
and we need it now.

606
00:26:04,723 --> 00:26:06,857
What you're asking is dangerous.

607
00:26:06,892 --> 00:26:08,492
I mean, gangs here are protected.

608
00:26:08,527 --> 00:26:09,960
They don't answer to anybody.

609
00:26:09,995 --> 00:26:12,763
We just want to have a conversation.

610
00:26:12,798 --> 00:26:15,531
Urdu-speaking gang, I mean...

611
00:26:15,567 --> 00:26:17,767
This is someone emboldened and brazen,

612
00:26:17,802 --> 00:26:19,268
willing to take risks.

613
00:26:19,303 --> 00:26:21,838
And they have resources, vehicles,

614
00:26:21,873 --> 00:26:23,806
and expectation of privacy.

615
00:26:23,842 --> 00:26:27,042
Do Tuppaki... Two Guns.

616
00:26:27,078 --> 00:26:28,878
Their leader, Aziz Ahmed

617
00:26:28,913 --> 00:26:30,713
doesn't have a
reputation without reason.

618
00:26:30,748 --> 00:26:32,948
Neither do I.

619
00:26:32,984 --> 00:26:35,017
They're not gonna like
a woman asking questions.

620
00:26:35,052 --> 00:26:36,218
And I'm not fluent.

621
00:26:36,253 --> 00:26:37,786
Call Simmons and have him meet us.

622
00:26:37,821 --> 00:26:40,155
In the meantime, help
Mae back at the station

623
00:26:40,191 --> 00:26:41,991
with Jamal's family.

624
00:26:42,759 --> 00:26:43,959
Hey...

625
00:26:43,995 --> 00:26:45,827
Thank you.

626
00:26:49,766 --> 00:26:52,734
If you think you can handle it...

627
00:26:52,769 --> 00:26:55,837
we could use a translator.

628
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:06,747
In a conservative
country like Bangladesh,

629
00:27:06,782 --> 00:27:08,349
clubbing is frowned upon.

630
00:27:08,385 --> 00:27:11,352
So an underground culture of
daytime raves has sprung up.

631
00:27:11,388 --> 00:27:12,586
So you party in the afternoon,

632
00:27:12,622 --> 00:27:13,754
and then you're home by dinner.

633
00:27:13,789 --> 00:27:15,223
Yeah. I've got a lot of fond memories

634
00:27:15,258 --> 00:27:17,225
of similar parties back
in London when I was a kid.

635
00:27:18,128 --> 00:27:20,261
Speaking of which, can I ask you guys

636
00:27:20,296 --> 00:27:22,730
a question about Agent Seger?

637
00:27:22,765 --> 00:27:23,964
No.

638
00:27:35,636 --> 00:27:38,682
_

639
00:27:39,409 --> 00:27:41,120
_

640
00:27:53,185 --> 00:27:55,044
_

641
00:27:55,130 --> 00:27:57,348
_

642
00:28:00,164 --> 00:28:01,828
_

643
00:28:03,638 --> 00:28:05,838
Salaam alaikum.

644
00:28:06,808 --> 00:28:08,541
Tell him we have reason to believe

645
00:28:08,577 --> 00:28:10,376
he might be able to help us.

646
00:28:18,152 --> 00:28:20,652
He wants to know why he should help us.

647
00:28:20,688 --> 00:28:22,955
Ask him about the missing Americans.

648
00:28:28,028 --> 00:28:28,827
Hey!

649
00:28:28,862 --> 00:28:31,162
- Stop! Federal agent!
- Jack

650
00:28:31,198 --> 00:28:33,665
Jack! Jack!

651
00:28:33,701 --> 00:28:34,967
Police, freeze!

652
00:28:35,002 --> 00:28:36,001
Hands up!

653
00:28:36,036 --> 00:28:38,136
Stop! FBI!

654
00:28:38,171 --> 00:28:39,738
Come on, get up!

655
00:28:45,011 --> 00:28:46,435
Come on.

656
00:28:51,553 --> 00:28:53,245
I think you saw a couple of tourists,

657
00:28:53,334 --> 00:28:54,929
thought they'd make easy marks.

658
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:57,217
Everything went as
planned, until your friend

659
00:28:57,297 --> 00:28:59,364
flew off the handle,
attacked their driver,

660
00:28:59,524 --> 00:29:00,772
and brutally killed him.

661
00:29:06,556 --> 00:29:08,556
Where did you see them?

662
00:29:14,631 --> 00:29:16,731
Do you think your buddy's in
there, taking the fall for you?

663
00:29:16,767 --> 00:29:18,224
No, no, no. He's in there
telling my boss right now

664
00:29:18,277 --> 00:29:20,344
this whole thing was your plan.

665
00:29:21,772 --> 00:29:26,140
You kill a man like that,
you can expect no mercy.

666
00:29:26,176 --> 00:29:27,541
We innocent.

667
00:29:27,576 --> 00:29:29,143
We want money.

668
00:29:29,179 --> 00:29:30,738
There is another man.

669
00:29:30,816 --> 00:29:33,283
He's... he's real killer.

670
00:29:33,318 --> 00:29:35,085
I tell him, "Have mercy."

671
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,688
He said, "Take money, go."

672
00:29:37,723 --> 00:29:39,622
He wanted Americans.

673
00:29:39,657 --> 00:29:41,124
Wanted them for what?

674
00:29:41,159 --> 00:29:42,358
I... I don't know.

675
00:29:42,394 --> 00:29:43,693
Who was this other man?

676
00:29:45,397 --> 00:29:48,764
Never saw his face.

677
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,133
But he must work at the factories.

678
00:29:52,337 --> 00:29:54,304
His fingers were stained with dye.

679
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:57,306
He was crazy one.

680
00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:01,143
They didn't kill anyone.

681
00:30:01,178 --> 00:30:02,945
They thought they were gonna
roll a couple foreigners,

682
00:30:02,981 --> 00:30:04,146
make some quick cash.

683
00:30:04,181 --> 00:30:05,280
Yeah, these guys are just

684
00:30:05,316 --> 00:30:06,448
the neighborhood muscle, nothing more.

685
00:30:06,484 --> 00:30:09,218
Unlike the man who hired
them, they didn't have a plan.

686
00:30:09,253 --> 00:30:11,120
We spoke to Jamal's family.

687
00:30:11,155 --> 00:30:13,188
He borrowed the money to
start his own business,

688
00:30:13,224 --> 00:30:14,689
but he's not involved in any gangs.

689
00:30:14,725 --> 00:30:16,492
Yeah, David and Robbie
offered to help him.

690
00:30:16,527 --> 00:30:18,160
Jamal considered them friends.

691
00:30:18,195 --> 00:30:19,294
And on the night in question,

692
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:20,795
he was taking them to see his family.

693
00:30:20,831 --> 00:30:23,198
David and Robbie were
the targets all along.

694
00:30:23,234 --> 00:30:25,000
Yeah, Jamal was just collateral damage.

695
00:30:25,035 --> 00:30:26,801
Found a body.

696
00:30:26,837 --> 00:30:28,637
It might be one of the Americans.

697
00:30:28,672 --> 00:30:31,305
Mae, Clara, go check it out.

698
00:30:31,341 --> 00:30:32,907
You want to come?

699
00:30:32,943 --> 00:30:36,177
Let's see if we can
I.D. the third attacker.

700
00:30:38,548 --> 00:30:40,749
Thank you. Come this way.

701
00:30:40,784 --> 00:30:42,183
He's right over here.

702
00:30:54,364 --> 00:30:57,265
It's Robbie.

703
00:30:57,300 --> 00:31:00,268
There is significant trauma here.

704
00:31:00,303 --> 00:31:02,369
Yeah, unlike Jamal.

705
00:31:02,404 --> 00:31:04,571
This unsub took his time with Robbie.

706
00:31:04,606 --> 00:31:07,107
It's definite overkill.

707
00:31:07,143 --> 00:31:09,409
Has a piece of cloth
jammed in his throat.

708
00:31:09,444 --> 00:31:11,011
He might have suffocated.

709
00:31:11,047 --> 00:31:13,246
I'm not gonna know more
until I can get a closer look.

710
00:31:13,282 --> 00:31:15,082
This doesn't bode well for David.

711
00:31:15,117 --> 00:31:16,516
No, it doesn't.

712
00:31:16,552 --> 00:31:18,851
Somebody must have seen something.

713
00:31:18,887 --> 00:31:20,353
Okay, I'm gonna take him back to the jet

714
00:31:20,389 --> 00:31:22,322
and perform the autopsy.

715
00:31:25,327 --> 00:31:27,093
Any luck with witnesses?

716
00:31:27,128 --> 00:31:29,296
No, we just got a lot of
doors slammed in our faces.

717
00:31:29,331 --> 00:31:30,330
People are afraid to talk.

718
00:31:30,365 --> 00:31:32,632
Well, we struck out on
I.D.ing our third suspect,

719
00:31:32,668 --> 00:31:33,933
but given the fact
that they were targeted

720
00:31:33,968 --> 00:31:36,135
and the violence, we think that
this was a personal vendetta.

721
00:31:36,171 --> 00:31:38,270
These were not the
cold, dispassionate kills

722
00:31:38,306 --> 00:31:40,272
you'd expect from an
opportunistic offender.

723
00:31:40,308 --> 00:31:41,808
Yeah, this is someone

724
00:31:41,843 --> 00:31:44,410
deeply aggrieved.

725
00:31:45,479 --> 00:31:46,378
Go ahead, Mae.

726
00:31:46,414 --> 00:31:48,915
So Robbie was killed by a single strike

727
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:50,917
to his right anterior jugular.

728
00:31:50,952 --> 00:31:53,285
But he was clearly physically abused.

729
00:31:53,321 --> 00:31:55,621
He has bruising, suffocation,

730
00:31:55,656 --> 00:31:58,390
his left knee was deliberately crushed.

731
00:31:58,426 --> 00:32:00,092
Our unsub did a number on him.

732
00:32:00,127 --> 00:32:01,727
Yeah, and get this...

733
00:32:01,762 --> 00:32:03,295
Robbie's skin had traces

734
00:32:03,331 --> 00:32:06,265
of a particular
combination of chemicals.

735
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:09,300
They're copper, dioxin,
and formaldehyde.

736
00:32:09,336 --> 00:32:11,770
And all three, when taken together,

737
00:32:11,805 --> 00:32:13,504
are used to dye clothes.

738
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:15,472
According to Haamid and Uday,

739
00:32:15,507 --> 00:32:17,141
our unsub worked at the factories.

740
00:32:17,176 --> 00:32:18,508
He had dye on his hands.

741
00:32:18,544 --> 00:32:19,944
That must be where he spotted them.

742
00:32:19,979 --> 00:32:21,846
Yeah, Robbie's knee was crushed.

743
00:32:21,881 --> 00:32:24,248
He was beaten and suffocated.

744
00:32:24,283 --> 00:32:25,850
It sounds like the hazards of working

745
00:32:25,885 --> 00:32:27,251
in the ready made garment industry.

746
00:32:27,286 --> 00:32:29,153
You think David and
Robbie are surrogates,

747
00:32:29,188 --> 00:32:32,188
a way for our unsub to lash
out at a particular injustice?

748
00:32:32,224 --> 00:32:34,758
Our unsub did stuff a
shirt down Robbie's throat.

749
00:32:34,793 --> 00:32:36,526
It's the very thing that
they came here to buy.

750
00:32:36,562 --> 00:32:38,428
Yeah, businesses here are driven by

751
00:32:38,464 --> 00:32:41,097
Western clothing companies
outsourcing their labor.

752
00:32:41,133 --> 00:32:42,633
Workers make the lowest
wage in the world.

753
00:32:42,668 --> 00:32:44,501
In return, the work in
dangerous conditions.

754
00:32:44,536 --> 00:32:47,137
- Hey, Jack.
- Monty, what can you tell us

755
00:32:47,172 --> 00:32:49,538
about industrial
disasters here in Dhaka?

756
00:32:49,574 --> 00:32:51,374
We think a factory fire or cave-in

757
00:32:51,409 --> 00:32:52,508
was our unsub's stressor.

758
00:32:52,543 --> 00:32:55,444
Well, for one, accidents
are surprisingly common.

759
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,680
It is pure negligence on
the part of the owners.

760
00:32:57,715 --> 00:33:00,349
Well, you say negligence, I say malice.

761
00:33:00,385 --> 00:33:02,518
These workers are treated
like they're more disposable

762
00:33:02,553 --> 00:33:04,052
than the $5.00 T-shirts they make.

763
00:33:04,088 --> 00:33:05,621
Our unsub's pain is fresh,

764
00:33:05,657 --> 00:33:07,523
so let's focus on recent accidents.

765
00:33:07,558 --> 00:33:12,027
Um, okay. There was a tannery
fire about six months ago.

766
00:33:12,062 --> 00:33:13,562
Balan Plaza.

767
00:33:13,598 --> 00:33:14,997
It was a mixed-use factory,

768
00:33:15,032 --> 00:33:16,732
home to a number of
Western clothing labels.

769
00:33:16,768 --> 00:33:18,634
Yeah, Balan Plaza.

770
00:33:18,670 --> 00:33:20,169
The building was over capacity,

771
00:33:20,204 --> 00:33:21,536
and the bottom three floors collapsed.

772
00:33:21,571 --> 00:33:22,604
But it didn't get a lot of coverage.

773
00:33:22,639 --> 00:33:25,340
The owner is well connected
and used his influence

774
00:33:25,375 --> 00:33:27,209
to play down the accident in the press.

775
00:33:27,244 --> 00:33:29,577
Yeah, dozens and dozens of
people were buried alive,

776
00:33:29,613 --> 00:33:31,579
but they suffocated because the rescuers

777
00:33:31,615 --> 00:33:32,915
didn't have time to dig them out.

778
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:34,549
And some lost whole families.

779
00:33:34,584 --> 00:33:36,318
That sounds like the kind of trauma

780
00:33:36,353 --> 00:33:38,019
that would give rise to a revenge-driven

781
00:33:38,054 --> 00:33:39,487
angry retaliatory killer.

782
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:42,524
He's making David and Robbie suffer

783
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:43,692
like his family suffered.

784
00:33:43,727 --> 00:33:44,926
What happened to the building?

785
00:33:44,961 --> 00:33:46,861
It was condemned, isolated.

786
00:33:46,896 --> 00:33:48,596
They can't tear it down till
they figure out what to do

787
00:33:48,632 --> 00:33:49,664
with the toxic waste.

788
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:51,766
Monty, we need an address
and building schematics.

789
00:33:51,802 --> 00:33:53,835
Coming your way A.S.A.P.

790
00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:56,003
- Thanks.
- I'd like you to come with us.

791
00:34:07,317 --> 00:34:10,551
Is that your family in those pictures?

792
00:34:10,586 --> 00:34:12,386
I have a family.

793
00:34:12,421 --> 00:34:15,689
I have a daughter on the way.

794
00:34:15,725 --> 00:34:17,591
Please let me get home.

795
00:34:17,626 --> 00:34:19,727
For my baby girl.

796
00:34:19,762 --> 00:34:21,628
A girl?

797
00:34:21,664 --> 00:34:22,696
Yeah.

798
00:34:22,732 --> 00:34:24,531
A baby girl.

799
00:34:24,567 --> 00:34:26,466
It's my first.

800
00:34:26,501 --> 00:34:27,533
I had girl.

801
00:34:33,675 --> 00:34:35,242
And I had wife.

802
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:51,056
But no more.

803
00:34:51,092 --> 00:34:53,058
Tui guilty.

804
00:34:53,094 --> 00:34:54,594
Guilty?

805
00:34:54,629 --> 00:34:56,095
I... I... what?!

806
00:34:56,130 --> 00:34:58,664
Please, tell me what... What I can do.

807
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:00,131
You are guilty.

808
00:35:00,166 --> 00:35:01,566
I must make right.

809
00:35:01,602 --> 00:35:03,502
No, I don't... I don't understand.

810
00:35:03,537 --> 00:35:05,136
I didn't do anything.

811
00:35:05,171 --> 00:35:07,406
Please, please.

812
00:35:07,610 --> 00:35:09,813
_

813
00:35:10,306 --> 00:35:11,876
_

814
00:35:13,547 --> 00:35:15,447
You are guilty.

815
00:35:15,482 --> 00:35:17,180
No.

816
00:35:17,216 --> 00:35:18,682
No.

817
00:35:30,029 --> 00:35:31,317
Stay close to me.

818
00:35:31,365 --> 00:35:33,138
Things are gonna move very quickly.

819
00:35:33,232 --> 00:35:35,132
I'll guide the
conversation, but remember,

820
00:35:35,167 --> 00:35:36,933
our unsub wants to be heard,

821
00:35:36,969 --> 00:35:39,836
he wants his pain to be legitimized.

822
00:35:42,074 --> 00:35:44,007
Please.

823
00:35:45,844 --> 00:35:47,144
Please, please!

824
00:35:49,047 --> 00:35:52,215
Put the weapon down!

825
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:55,018
We know you're in pain.

826
00:35:55,053 --> 00:35:56,620
But you don't have to hurt this man.

827
00:35:56,655 --> 00:35:57,706
Put down your weapon.

828
00:36:07,031 --> 00:36:08,464
There's still time to make things right.

829
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:09,632
This man here...

830
00:36:13,771 --> 00:36:15,238
... he's a journalist.

831
00:36:15,273 --> 00:36:17,373
He can tell your story.

832
00:36:28,785 --> 00:36:30,671
His wife and daughter were crushed.

833
00:36:31,688 --> 00:36:33,655
Because of him.

834
00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:37,058
People like him come to take.

835
00:36:37,093 --> 00:36:39,193
My family died, and for what?

836
00:36:39,228 --> 00:36:41,896
A cheap piece of cloth to make money?!

837
00:36:41,931 --> 00:36:42,930
Let us tell your story!

838
00:36:42,966 --> 00:36:43,765
Jeffery!

839
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,333
Look, we can help you.

840
00:36:47,137 --> 00:36:49,370
Somebody must pay!

841
00:36:49,405 --> 00:36:50,738
- No!
- Don't do it!

842
00:36:53,884 --> 00:36:56,517
Stay down.

843
00:36:56,546 --> 00:36:59,513
- It's okay, you're safe.
- Thank you.

844
00:37:05,087 --> 00:37:06,187
Thank you.

845
00:37:06,222 --> 00:37:08,055
We're gonna get you out of here.

846
00:37:13,162 --> 00:37:16,863
So, how did things go with Jeffrey?

847
00:37:16,899 --> 00:37:17,731
What do you mean?

848
00:37:17,766 --> 00:37:20,901
Oh, I think you know
exactly what I mean.

849
00:37:20,936 --> 00:37:24,905
What, I thanked him, for
his time, and then I...

850
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:26,206
gave him my card.

851
00:37:26,241 --> 00:37:29,375
In case he ever needs anything... ever.

852
00:37:29,411 --> 00:37:31,644
That's my girl.

853
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:35,114
I can't believe Robbie's gone.

854
00:37:35,149 --> 00:37:38,117
He sacrificed himself for me.

855
00:37:38,152 --> 00:37:41,120
For my family.

856
00:37:41,155 --> 00:37:42,722
Well, he believed in you.

857
00:37:42,757 --> 00:37:44,424
Loved you.

858
00:37:44,459 --> 00:37:46,058
He'd want you to keep moving forward.

859
00:37:49,849 --> 00:37:51,348
David.

860
00:37:51,665 --> 00:37:53,733
I just got off with my office.

861
00:37:53,768 --> 00:37:56,468
Your wife has gone into labor.

862
00:37:56,503 --> 00:37:59,238
We're gonna get you
there as fast as we can.

863
00:38:03,043 --> 00:38:04,610
