11
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,660
'My name's Bhola Prasad Tripathi.'

12
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:29,930
'You must be wondering
why was I running.'

13
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:34,100
'To know that, you'll have
to come with me to Lucknow.'

14
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,510
'This is Sunita.
She's works in a government bank.'

15
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:41,380
'We met regarding a loan.'

16
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:45,510
'The loan got passed
and she's paying its installments.'

17
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:46,850
Good evening, grandma.

18
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:49,550
'After all, she's my wife.'

19
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,350
Oh God, Please help me.

20
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:55,720
Why trouble god for
such a small thing?

21
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:58,520
I have got this imported balm,

22
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:01,180
you will feel better.

23
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,470
Let me see.

24
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,810
- Water.
- Thank you.

25
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,060
- Sunita...
- Yes?

26
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,100
What's for dinner?

27
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:15,310
Mood.

28
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:40,950
I spent 650 bucks at
Lovely Beauty Parlour.

29
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:43,220
Didn't you notice anything different?

30
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,880
Did you shave your moustache?

31
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:51,570
You look exactly the same.

32
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:53,810
What a waste of money!

33
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:59,110
Come on, serve me dinner.

34
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:09,100
You'll have me for dinner today.

35
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:12,830
All this teasing's fine.

36
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:15,870
But, nothing beyond it.

37
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,310
I don't have protection.

38
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:18,830
Great! I don't even want protection.

39
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,520
I want a child.

40
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:24,126
You should be encouraging
your unemployed husband to get a job.

41
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:25,540
And not increase his expenses.

42
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:27,470
In unemployment,
how will I raise a child?

43
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:30,390
Did I ask you for
money to raise a child?

44
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,696
Even if you are unemployed
for the rest of you life,

45
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,100
I can fend
for you and your child.

46
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,180
Don't spoil the mood...
come.

47
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,560
I have the better idea...

48
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,930
I have bought this ring for you.

49
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:53,100
We've been married for three years.

50
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:56,520
Please let's have a child.

51
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:00,380
Why do you need another one when
I'm still like a child!

52
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:18,870
I'm glad you're here.

53
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:21,100
Look, the Neighbour's daughter is
adam-teasing me.

54
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:22,390
I treat her like a sister.

55
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,810
And see the way she's looking at me...

56
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,630
You are too cute!

57
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:38,810
Girls tease my little Bhola.

58
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:41,060
Here's 15,000.

59
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:45,310
For this month's groceries
and the rest is for you.

60
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:49,560
If my money wasn't
stuck in Benaras,

61
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:52,520
I would've never touched
my wife's money.

62
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:55,640
Neither do you want to touch
me nor my money.

63
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,310
What is it that you want?

64
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:00,470
Listen, my uncle's arriving.

65
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,210
He should be here by 11:30.

66
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:04,810
Please pick him up
Charbaug railway station.

67
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:07,060
But how will I recognise him.

68
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:08,930
He doesn't recognise you either.

69
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:11,970
Carry a placard with his name on it.

70
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:12,850
Cool.

71
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:14,390
I'm late for the bank.

72
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:15,500
Bye.

73
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,930
- What's his name?
- M.L. Chaurasia.

74
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:19,970
What?

75
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,760
I'll message it to you.

76
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:27,710
Crap!

77
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,560
Sunita, my dear...

78
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,560
Yes, uncle.

79
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:48,890
I can't find Bhola (SON-IN-LAW).

80
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:51,180
I was about to tell you that...

81
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:54,430
I wouldn't be able to come
with him anyway.

82
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:57,100
I have to go to Benaras
for some work.

83
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:58,770
I'll finish that and then come to you.

84
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,810
I'll send you Bholaji's photograph.

85
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:02,270
At least meet him.

86
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:04,880
Surely.

87
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:07,720
Attention, please.

88
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:09,840
Train 1356 from Benaras to Lucknow...

89
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:56,750
Fatso, let me go.

90
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:01,220
- Is this any way to talk?
- Shut up.

91
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:07,570
Bhola!

92
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:08,470
Move.

93
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,930
Just a minute.

94
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,410
Please move.

95
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:18,940
He's my son-in-law.

96
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:25,640
My love,
I'm missing you... loads.

97
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:27,890
Aastha, I love you.

98
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,020
As much as Romeo loved Juliet.

99
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:35,390
Enough, don't sweet talk me.

100
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,780
You always win me over
with your sweet talk.

101
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:41,850
But, why couldn't
I get through your phone?

102
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:43,970
It isn't working.

103
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:47,060
Do you know what
I'm thinking right now?

104
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:48,770
Our wedding day!

105
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:52,420
You arrived in my life
like my heroine.

106
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:57,000
'Not entirely true.'

107
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,910
'We met in a sugarcane field.'

108
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:03,520
'I learnt that her father
owned all of the 100 acres.'

109
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,440
'So, I married her.'

110
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:10,680
Congratulations.

111
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:12,430
You are now husband and wife.

112
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:13,930
Thank you.

113
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,760
I've to take this call.

114
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,790
Please sit in the car.

115
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:23,020
I'll pay him and be there in
a couple of minutes.

116
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:24,270
Come soon.

117
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:28,960
Change the bloody board.

118
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,260
Talk!

119
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:33,470
What?

120
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,270
I don't want to talk to you.
- Why not?

121
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:37,220
Just stay out all day.

122
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,890
At least ask me where I was.

123
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:40,030
No.

124
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:42,696
I am wearing the sweater you knitted
and going to Benaras for work.

125
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,180
- I won't let you sweet-talk me this time.
- Why?

126
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:48,450
Do you feel like give me a kiss?

127
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:49,360
I do.

128
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,520
On your cheeks.

129
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:52,270
And?

130
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:54,310
On your lips.

131
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:55,720
Shut up, you donkey monkey.

132
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:57,100
'She's right.'

133
00:09:57,270 --> 00:10:00,520
'Only a donkey monkey
would get married to such a girl...'

134
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,640
'Why did I marry her?'

135
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:06,680
'Because our wedding gift
was a 32-room villa.'

136
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,020
Who the hell is it?

137
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:15,640
My mistress.

138
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:19,680
Let it be, You try to act all macho
but you're not.

139
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:22,390
It must be your
business partner.

140
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:23,890
Tell me.

141
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:27,170
Sunita, don't stress.

142
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:31,210
I'll call you as soon as
I reach Benaras.

143
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:33,220
What an ass.

144
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:35,950
I have to do something.

145
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:39,060
I've told you umpteen number of times...
I don't want tea.

146
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:40,940
Madam, coffee?

147
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,080
Okay.

148
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:44,750
The coffee's cold.

149
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:46,180
I don't want it.

150
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:47,310
I've served it.

151
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:48,520
Now, you have to take it...

152
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,930
Don't force me.

153
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:51,520
I said I don't want it.

154
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,890
And your coffee's so cold.

155
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,310
Why are you forcing me?

156
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:56,270
Think of it as cold coffee.

157
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:57,430
What the hell!

158
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,680
Why do we have to take it?

159
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:04,560
Don't worry.

160
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:10,020
He's just out to trouble
a young beautiful woman.

161
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:12,840
We have to account for every cup.

162
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:16,160
One less and it will
be cut out of my salary.

163
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:21,020
Keep it.

164
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,640
Sunita, it's your uncle.

165
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:27,080
Yes, uncle.

166
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:33,350
What sort of man is your husband?

167
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,770
What do you mean, uncle?

168
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:40,640
Something's wrong.

169
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:43,350
Not a problem.

170
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:45,780
Please don't ever
consider yourself alone.

171
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:49,020
But, why did you pay?

172
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:50,970
How does it matter?

173
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:54,470
Keep this.

174
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:55,930
My money's back.

175
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:59,690
You can pay for a woman
only in two scenarios;

176
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:04,580
if she's your wife
or your girlfriend.

177
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,300
Unfortunately, you aren't either.

178
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:10,390
And I'm both.

179
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:13,430
- Sir, I don't have any change.
- Keep it.

180
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:20,140
And I've told you so many times
not to eat this rubbish.

181
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,720
You fall sick and my mood suffers.

182
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:26,770
Give it to me.

183
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:30,890
Brother is absolutely right...
sister-in-law.

184
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:35,270
Something strange is going on.

185
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:40,010
He was supposed to reach in time
for the train and didn't show up.

186
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:43,600
Uncle, he must've got busy
with some work.

187
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:46,220
Your son-in-law is a gem.

188
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,680
Who are you?

189
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:51,640
My name is...
Rana Bholapratap Singh.

190
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:53,350
I am on my way to Benaras...

191
00:12:53,560 --> 00:13:00,610
and noticed that sister-in-law
was being troubled So I came for help.

192
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,460
I respect you.

193
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,770
But, I won't hear
a word against my husband.

194
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:06,720
Not even from you.

195
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:12,520
I asked you even during your wedding
what your husband does for a living.

196
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:18,180
I have 4-5 cloth mills
and some shops.

197
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:21,470
And other such small things.

198
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:23,390
These bridges...

199
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:25,190
I have their contract.

200
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:29,330
A simple man with simple needs.

201
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:33,540
You are quite a modest fellow.

202
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:40,090
I'm Badri Vishaal.

203
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,890
My job is to chill.

204
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,280
And to spoil this lady.

205
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:51,810
I have so much ancestral money
that I don't need to do anything.

206
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:54,520
She's my wife... Payal.

207
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,970
- Namaste.

208

Here.

00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:10,180

Payalji!

217
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:47,210
Stop.

218
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,500
Shit.

219
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,600
- Hello.
- Where are you?

220
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:24,930
Yes, brother.

221
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,116
You were going to follow us.
Where did you disappear?

222
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:29,240
I didn't get lost.
I stopped.

223
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,720
What a turn of events.

224
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:35,390
Shit.

225
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,560
I'm taking a detour.
What are you guys doing?

226
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,680
The plan will get messed.
Don't worry.

227
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,720
I will catch him for you...
with proof.

228
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:43,680
Got it?

229
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:44,810
I'll hang up now.

230
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,200
Look there.

231
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,380
He isn't here. Come.

232
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,560
Hello.

233
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,390
Who? What?

234
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,470
Where?

235
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,680
Get out.

236
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,390
Will you take me to Benaras?

237
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,680
I can't.
The car's going to Lucknow.

238
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:21,930
It's very important that
I go to Benaras.

239
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,180
Please!

240
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:26,470
It'll cost you 10,000.

241
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:29,390
- Some...
- No.

242
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:31,950
- Some...
- No.

243
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:33,140
No.

244
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:35,930
Fine. Deal.

245
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:47,220
Yes, love.

246
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:49,020
Did you meet uncle?

247
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,100
How could I?

248
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:53,510
Didn't I message you that
I had to go to Benaras?

249
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:57,010
Uncle had called saying that
he's going to Benaras, too.

250
00:16:57,310 --> 00:16:58,990
Don't worry.

251
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:01,310
I'll meet him once I am back.

252
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:02,940
Take care.

253
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:08,950
What the hell are you doing?

254
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:37,640
Are you insane.

255
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:40,330
You're suspecting everyone.

256
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:42,850
When I was orphaned
and had to stay with grandma,

257
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:44,156
you didn't bother
showing concern then?

258
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:44,730
Look, Suni...

259
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:48,020
Now that I'm married,
you're jealous.

260
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:49,890
Have you gone mad?

261
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,190
Are you insane?

262
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:01,480
Drive properly.

263
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,640
Sorry.

264
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,920
I was distracted...
thinking of something else.

265
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:08,100
Concentrate on the road.

266
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:13,770
Has a gas bomb exploded
in your tummy?

267
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:15,116
Why are you stinking up the place?

268
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:16,270
Put down the windows.

269
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:18,580
I can't.

270
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:20,810
Why not?

271
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:23,160
I have a slight cold.

272
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,770
Do you want me to die of the smell?

273
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:27,290
If you open the windows, I'll die.

274
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:30,220
Who'll take you to Benaras, then?

275
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:37,860
Never have I heard a hole sing
so much!

276
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:38,810
Stop the car.

277
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,290
I said, "Stop!"

278
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,610
What a tragedy!

279
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:46,360
What have you eaten?

280
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,770
Who the hell is it?
- Chanda.

281
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:09,720
What do you want?

282
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:14,210
Chanda Yadav never asks
for anything... she demands it.

283
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:18,350
'Introducing
the biggest mistake of my life.'

284
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,520
'One I can't ignore
even if I want to.'

285
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,776
Have you bought a SIM card shop
that you keep changing...

286
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,640
your number and threatening me?

287
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:26,860
I haven't changed my number.

288
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,800
You've changed.

289
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:31,500
And it's going to cost you.

290
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:35,770
If my brother Dulaara doesn't hear
our wedding bells,

291
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:38,610
he'll be singing your eulogy.

292
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:40,030
I'm coming...

293
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:42,140
- I can't hear you, Chanda.
- Hello.

294
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:43,560
Connection...
the network's bad.

295
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,010
Chanda... hello.

296
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:46,340
Hello?

297
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:51,760
Your lordship,
please come to Mother earth.

298
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:53,640
Why have I stopped
hearing your voice?

299
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:59,050
What are you thinking?

300
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:08,220
Oh no...

301
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:13,020
He's frozen.
Throw him in the furnace.

302
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:15,390
- That'll get him really fired up.
- Are you mad?

303
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:16,720
Is there no doctor here?

304
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,810
We have a lady doctor.

346

On a serious note...

348
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:17,270
Tell me about yourself.

349
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,890
Benaras.

350
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:24,390
I get that but what about you?

351
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:26,810
Like... what do you do?

352
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:28,190
Where are you from?

353
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:29,640
Where are you going?

354
00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:30,480
Benaras.

355
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:33,470
I know you're going to Benaras.

356
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:37,100
Tell me something about yourself.

357
00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:39,060
Are you married?

358
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:41,140
Do you have kids?

359
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,570
Where do you stay?

360
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:44,040
I stay in Benaras.

361
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:48,640
Bro, I get that you are from Benaras
and are headed there, too.

362
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:49,810
Unbelievable.

363
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:51,890
I'm going there.

364
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:53,660
My home's there.
Benaras.

365
00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:56,800
You have to tell me
where in Benaras do you stay.

366
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:58,940
I'm going to Benaras.

367
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,900
You're the worst kind of
man there is.

368
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:07,850
Wake me up as soon as
we get to Benaras.

369
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:12,090
Bastard drank up alcohol worth
1500 rupees but didn't reveal a thing.

370
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,850
- Okay... thank you.
- What?

371
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:06,050
You'r so selfish.

372
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:15,770
I won't forget your generosity
in my lifetime.

373
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:19,830
At least give me my 10,000.

374
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:24,980
That's what I'm talking about.
Unbelievable.

375
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:31,890
<i>♪ Demands... ♪</i>

376
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,100
Where is it?

377
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:10,680
Where the hell is it?

378
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,310
Where did I put my phone?

379
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:24,380
Shraddha, where's my phone?

380
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:26,180
Why are you asking me?

381
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:28,500
You'll find it at the bar
you were drinking last night.

382
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,990
It's all your fault.

383
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:31,990
You're always on my mind.

384
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:33,250
I lost my bag.

385
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:34,960
And now,
I've even lost my phone.

386
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:39,710
I swear you wouldn't have been
so worried if I were lost.

387
00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:43,100
You lost your bag, phone...
one day you'll lose me, too.

388
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:48,800
My love, your cheeks get all rosy
and cute when you get angry.

389
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:51,170
It's only morning!

390
00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:54,580
Last night all I saw was your back.

391
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,420
I was exhausted.

392
00:27:56,630 --> 00:28:00,060
I'm no stud who can get into
action immediately.

393
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:03,060
Don't talk nonsense!

394
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:08,040
Go freshen up and
I'll make you some tea.

395
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:14,810
Where did I keep my phone?

396
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:17,150
Here's his phone.

397
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:18,440
What do I do?

398
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,850
Get it checked.

399
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:21,600
It'll all be clear.

400
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:25,570
We are married since two years.

401
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,320
- Are you listening?
- Yes.

402
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:29,500
My relatives are complaining.

403
00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:31,690
You haven't even
met anyone as yet.

404
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:33,680
You're still the new son-in-law.

405
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:36,020
You're not old yourself.

406
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:38,670
Still young and fresh.

407
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:41,640
Neither will I look any other way.
Got it?

408
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:45,560
Hey...

409
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:51,140
Have you managed the 30,000
I need for the 10 lakh tender?

410
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:52,300
Oh God!

411
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:54,310
What?

412
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,230
It's in the box.

413
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:05,140
And take 5000 extra for your phone,
as well.

414
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:07,130
Wow.

415
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:13,440
I have a gift for you.

416
00:29:13,810 --> 00:29:14,810
Is it?

417
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:21,100
Like it?

418
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:29,770
Should I tell you something
I find you very hot.

419
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:30,980
Shut up.

420
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:33,480
There's a lot to do.

421
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:34,560
Stop it.

422
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,270
I've to go to the market
for groceries.

423
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:38,450
Groceries?

424
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:40,360
I have other devious plans.

425
00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:44,610
How about we play
'Damsel-in-distress'?

426
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:46,150
You're unbelievable.

427
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:48,440
I need groceries.

428
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:50,730
No!

429
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:53,470
No!

430
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:58,160
Save me!

431
00:29:58,840 --> 00:29:59,840
Oh Lord!

432
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,940
- My buttons will break.
- Sorry.

433
00:30:21,170 --> 00:30:22,470
Hurry.

434
00:30:31,050 --> 00:30:32,480
Just a minute.

435
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:35,110
What happened?

436
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:36,260
Where are you going?

437
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:37,690
Where's my wallet?

438
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,750
- I'm not asking for money.
- Where is it?

439
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,080
Got it.

440
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:42,130
Here.

441
00:30:57,250 --> 00:30:58,810
What the hell is going on?

442
00:30:59,250 --> 00:30:59,770
What?

443
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:00,970
Who's she?

444
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:02,480
Who?

445
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:04,420
Who's who?

446
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,830
Pass my shirt.

447
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,240
Shameless man!

448
00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:17,270
You've been caught red-handed
but still won't admit it.

449
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:19,420
Shut up.

450
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:22,940
How dare you speak to
my husband like that!

451
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:25,120
Are you her husband?

452
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:26,860
Yes.

453
00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:28,630
Who am I, then?

454
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:30,060
You're mental.

455
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:33,060
I'll slap you if you
don't leave right now.

456
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:34,880
This is my ring.

457
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,140
Bholaji had given it to me.

458
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:37,500
- Remove it.
- Let go of my hand.

459
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,410
- Take it off.
- Let go of my ring.

460
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,620
Just a minute.

461
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:43,060
You'll are fighting over a ring?

462
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:44,060
You should be ashamed.

463
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:45,640
I'll throw it away.

464
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:53,060
Sunita, this is
Shraddha and vice versa.

465
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:57,690
Sunita is my wife and
I am Shraddha's husband.

466
00:31:58,140 --> 00:31:59,850
- Simple.
- Got it?

467
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,020
Are you crazy?

468
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:03,270
He is both our husband.

469
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:07,130
Unreal... I'm your wife.

470
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:10,320
Not a policy
that you can have multiple one's.

471
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:12,830
There can be only one wife.

472
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:14,360
And that's me.

473
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,440
Isn't it?

474
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:21,730
I made a mistake.

475
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:24,370
I was about to tell you.

476
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,970
But circumstances got so crazy
that I couldn't...

477
00:32:27,050 --> 00:32:29,350
- What circumstances?
- Shut up.

478
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:36,270
Just tell us who's the real wife
and who's the catastrophic mistake?

479
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:37,390
You are.

480
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,520
- Have you seen your face?
- Sure.

481
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,900
- Look at yourself.
- Let it be.

482
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:42,366
Get out of my house,
you are mistake.

483
00:32:42,390 --> 00:32:43,810
Miss India...
you are the mistake.

484
00:32:43,890 --> 00:32:45,480
Why should I get out?

485
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:48,390
What are you'll doing?
Try and understand.

486
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:51,140
We can sort it out.

487
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:56,230
Is this an ambulance
or a police siren?

488
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:57,680
The cops.

489
00:32:58,170 --> 00:32:59,310
I've called them.

490
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,650
Cops?

491
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,510
You called the cops?

492
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:04,790
Yes.

493
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:10,600
You swore on your love
and you've called the cops on me?

494
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:13,120
You should've at least discussed it.

495
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:15,630
Fine.

496
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:18,860
I made a mistake
and I deserve to be punished.

497
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:20,020
Come.

498
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:21,810
Up there.

499
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:24,740
The cops will put me behind bars.

500
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:26,440
That'll be so humiliating.

501
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:28,520
I won't be able to bear it.

502
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:32,230
I'll commit suicide.

503
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:33,380
I'm going.

504
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:35,080
No! Wait.

505
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:40,200
I'll explain to the cops.

506
00:33:41,170 --> 00:33:42,200
That's the house.

507
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:45,600
It's no good, Sunita.

508
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:47,600
It's too late.

509
00:33:47,770 --> 00:33:48,770
No.

510
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:52,560
Go and hide inside.

511
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:55,130
We'll manage the situation.

512
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:56,420
She's right.

513
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,980
Go and hide in the garden outside.

514
00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:00,270
Big sister?

515
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:02,250
How dare you.

516
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:04,430
I'm younger than you for sure.

517
00:34:08,170 --> 00:34:08,980
Really?

518
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:10,480
Tell me your date of birth.

519
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,880
You first.

520
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:16,050
What's happening?

521
00:34:17,290 --> 00:34:18,520
What are you doing here?

522
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:19,700
- Run!
- Go!

523
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:20,850
I'm going.

524
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:26,770
Yes?

525
00:34:26,850 --> 00:34:29,170
He must be inside.
Arrest him.

526
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:31,810
Child, don't worry.
We've come to save you.

527
00:34:31,890 --> 00:34:33,690
- What?
- He isn't her to save us.

528
00:34:33,770 --> 00:34:35,650
He's here to destroy us.

529
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:36,640
And you are?

530
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:38,270
- She's...
- I'm Sunita.

531
00:34:38,390 --> 00:34:39,810
Bholaji's only wife.

532
00:34:39,890 --> 00:34:41,200
She's my niece, sir.

533
00:34:41,350 --> 00:34:42,850
Yes.
She's my uncle.

534
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:43,980
But, he's mad.

535
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:46,000
He's run away from the asylum twice.

536
00:34:46,130 --> 00:34:50,680
He called me saying
that my naive Bholaji is a fraud...

537
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,550
that he's marrying again.

538
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:56,560
And I'm so stupid to have believed him
and came here...

539
00:34:56,770 --> 00:35:00,440
to her home
and started abusing her.

540
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:02,270
I'm sorry, sister.

541
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:05,190
- It's been a mistake.
- She's crazy in love.

542
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:07,690
Ask her where's Bhola is right now.

543
00:35:07,810 --> 00:35:08,980
He's at home.

544
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:13,960
He's been asking me since morning
where I've been all night.

545
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:18,850
What do I tell him?

546
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,850
I'll explain to him.

547
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:22,480
He'll understand.

548
00:35:22,770 --> 00:35:24,230
Don't cry.

549
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:26,770
- Go inside.
- Listen, child...

550
00:35:27,010 --> 00:35:29,100
Come here, you fatso.

551
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:30,670
What's all this?

552
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:34,090
Sir, this girl is madly in love
with her husband.

553
00:35:34,290 --> 00:35:35,800
We have proof.

554
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:39,190
Look at the phone
I gave you last night.

555
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:40,440
You'll know the truth.

556
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:41,600
I did.

557
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,320
It's in the name of a Chunilal.

558
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:45,850
- Lies!
- Are you calling me a liar?

559
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:46,640
No, sir.

560
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:53,480
I would've slapped you
and taught you a lesson if I could.

561
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:57,820
Look at yourself.

562
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,880
Don't you have any sense?

563
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:01,690
Mad.

564
00:36:01,770 --> 00:36:03,770
Don't go walking alone.

565
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:06,760
Come on.

566
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,100
Fine.

567
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,750
Is this the way
you want to play the game?

568
00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:23,540
I won't spare you.

569
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:29,990
Bholaji, where are you?

570
00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:32,940
Bholaji, please come out.

571
00:36:33,490 --> 00:36:35,370
They've left.

572
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:15,370
Boss, how's life treating you?

573
00:37:16,490 --> 00:37:18,370
You're timing's perfect.

574
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:19,910
Drop me to the highway.

575
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:22,000
Sure, I can drop you.

576
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:24,730
But, the cops will catch you.

577
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,620
You're up for grabs.

578
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:31,240
Who the hell are you?

579
00:37:31,730 --> 00:37:36,040
An honest man trying
to earn an honest living.

580
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:39,410
But, the world keeps
meddling with me.

581
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:45,240
I met you and thought...
that's life!

582
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:49,660
Bholaji farts and the world
stops to take in the fragrance.

583
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,370
What do you want?

584
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,830
Your partnership.

585
00:37:55,580 --> 00:38:02,490
I want to learn your ways...
and maybe earn a couple of bucks.

586
00:38:02,790 --> 00:38:04,620
You want me to carry
your dead weight around?

587
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:06,580
I'm not dead weight,
I'm your boon in disguise.

588
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:10,200
I saved you earlier,

589
00:38:10,450 --> 00:38:13,700
I'm saving you now and will
be helpful in the future too.

590
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:16,100
Think about it.

591
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:18,340
I'm worth it.

592
00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:29,410
You are the worst kind of man but
that's the only thing right about you.

593
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:38,410
'Once I'm out of Benaras...'

594
00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:41,160
'I'll get rid of you and
you will never find your way back.'

595
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:44,220
'From today...
your fate changes.'

Put the vermillion for the bride.

631
00:41:58,810 --> 00:42:01,120
Everything's done, brother Dulaare.
All done?

632
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,830
Here's your gift.

633
00:42:02,990 --> 00:42:05,540
Brother Dulaare, congratulations
on getting a brother-in-law.

634
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:07,050
To you, too.

635
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:10,040
Sister... are you happy?

636
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:11,240
Yes.

637
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:15,590
Brother-in-law, here are the keys
to the Benaras home.

638
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:17,870
Your wedding gift.

639
00:42:18,310 --> 00:42:19,130
Sister, look away.

640
00:42:19,210 --> 00:42:21,190
I want to speak to brother-in-law.
- Sure.

641
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:27,010
The bullets that flew at
Lucknow station...

642
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:30,710
were to scare you off.

643
00:42:31,170 --> 00:42:32,580
I'm your brother-in-law.

644
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:34,120
Forgive me.

645
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:36,840
But, listen carefully,
brother-in-law.

646
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:42,700
If you even think of leaving my sister,
you will depart from this world.

647
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:43,790
Got it?

648
00:42:43,870 --> 00:42:45,160
Sister is looking.
Smile now.

649
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:46,280
Quickly.

650
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:47,440
Very good.

651
00:42:47,590 --> 00:42:48,900
Time for blessings.

652
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,780
- Long live.
- Done.

653
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:57,030
Let's go.

654
00:43:09,870 --> 00:43:12,280
Can you see anyone behind?

655
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:15,630
No.

656
00:43:15,790 --> 00:43:16,990
No?

657
00:43:17,730 --> 00:43:21,380
Then drive faster.
I'm very eager to go to Benaras.

658
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:26,290
To start my new life with my love!

659
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:34,030
I will furnish the home
so well that you will die with joy!

660
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:38,650
We'll paint one room green.

661
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:41,950
Another yellow, another blue...
and one, aubergine purple.

662
00:43:42,030 --> 00:43:42,790
Aubergine purple?

663
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,040
So?

664
00:43:44,130 --> 00:43:48,410
It's not the best vegetable
but the colour's gorgeous.

665
00:43:48,910 --> 00:43:52,040
We'll have golden curtains
and silver bedding...

666
00:43:52,270 --> 00:43:58,000
so that you have royal dreams.

667
00:43:59,950 --> 00:44:01,990
Brother Murari, where will you stay?

668
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:06,590
We will convert the cowshed into
a guesthouse and he can stay there.

669
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:08,330
Brother Murari, are you married?

670
00:44:08,490 --> 00:44:09,710
If not, I can get you married.

671
00:44:09,790 --> 00:44:10,790
I'm married.

672
00:44:10,930 --> 00:44:13,650
So what?
We can get you re-married.

673
00:44:15,430 --> 00:44:16,990
What nonsense am I saying?

674
00:44:17,070 --> 00:44:19,540
You can't get re-married.

675
00:44:19,770 --> 00:44:21,700
That reminds me...

676
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:26,250
Brother Dulaare was telling
you that he'll shoot you...

677
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:28,510
if you think about
another marriage, isn't it?

678
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:31,280
I told him, "No!"

679
00:44:31,830 --> 00:44:35,450
Who's husband is he?

680
00:44:35,790 --> 00:44:37,120
I will shoot him.

681
00:44:37,290 --> 00:44:38,810
If you leave me,

682
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:45,880
I'll shoot you thrice on your backside
and some thrashing, too.

683
00:44:47,230 --> 00:44:48,630
Murari, please stop the car.

684
00:44:48,850 --> 00:44:50,820
What happened?
Where are you going?

685
00:44:51,050 --> 00:44:52,620
He must need to pee.

686
00:44:52,870 --> 00:44:57,120
Aubergine purple, my foot!

687
00:44:58,790 --> 00:45:01,130
The bitch will kill me...

688
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,310
What are you looking at?

689
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:17,250
Give me that book.

690
00:45:17,330 --> 00:45:18,360
No. I won't.

691
00:45:18,490 --> 00:45:22,080
I'll educate myself, become
a great leader and serve the nation.

692
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:25,380
I'll give you 50 bucks for the book.

693
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:31,490
- 100.
- What!

694
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:39,950
Serve the country?
100 bucks in bribe is all it took.

695
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:42,190
Uncle, buy mine, too.

696
00:45:42,430 --> 00:45:43,430
Shut up.

697
00:45:49,710 --> 00:45:51,840
Where's your coat?

698
00:45:52,370 --> 00:45:54,840
I was hot.
So, I took it out.

699
00:45:55,180 --> 00:45:56,410
And this book...

700
00:45:56,580 --> 00:45:59,210
I'm thinking of educating myself
to serve the country.

701
00:46:00,290 --> 00:46:03,180
You told me that
you had a gift for me.

702
00:46:03,580 --> 00:46:04,830
Give it.

703
00:46:08,530 --> 00:46:09,740
Give me your finger.

704
00:46:12,330 --> 00:46:13,620
Isn't it looking lovely?

705
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:15,970
It's beautiful.

706
00:46:16,350 --> 00:46:19,160
Once again stop the car.

707
00:46:19,450 --> 00:46:22,410
You are looking so beautiful.
Let me take some photographs.

708
00:46:23,620 --> 00:46:25,110
This pose is great.

709
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:27,430
Go back a little.

710
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:28,740
A little more.

711
00:46:38,370 --> 00:46:40,890
Maybe a little further back.

712
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:50,660
I'm clicking from the car.

713
00:46:51,950 --> 00:46:53,360
Stay there.

714
00:46:53,660 --> 00:46:55,110
Start the car! Hurry up!

715
00:46:59,330 --> 00:47:01,180
Where...?

716
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:08,070
Unbelievable.

717
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:11,280
My fate is doomed.

718
00:47:11,740 --> 00:47:14,580
I joined you so that
I could earn a quick buck.

719
00:47:14,950 --> 00:47:16,180
I got zilch.

720
00:47:16,450 --> 00:47:17,580
Instead, I'm in deep shit.

721
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:22,160
And you... her brother
gave you keys to a bungalow.

722
00:47:22,390 --> 00:47:26,400
Even if you sold it for 15-20 lakhs,
I could've made a neat 2-4 lakhs.

723
00:47:26,660 --> 00:47:28,370
And you dumped the girl!

724
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:33,060
Murari, you're a dimwit.

725
00:47:33,370 --> 00:47:36,080
I'm thinking of millions
and you're counting pennies.

726
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:40,740
And where the hell are you
going to get the millions?

727
00:47:40,970 --> 00:47:43,210
- Who's going to give it to you?
- Here are the millions.

728
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:47,330
Mala Dubey from Allahabad
Wins Two Million in the Lottery.

729
00:47:47,910 --> 00:47:50,280
Boss, is this your new game?

730
00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:53,600
Hardly new...
she's an old wife of mine.

731
00:47:53,990 --> 00:47:55,890
She turned out to be a smart cookie.

732
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:56,740
Really?

733
00:47:56,820 --> 00:47:59,040
I got home drunk one night.

734
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:00,830
She got pregnant.

735
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:02,426
And I become Mr. Invisible... poof...

736
00:48:02,450 --> 00:48:03,450
I disappeared!

737
00:48:03,940 --> 00:48:05,540
- You ran.
- Definitely.

738
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:07,660
Then how will you return to the scene?

739
00:48:07,790 --> 00:48:09,520
Look, I've just averted a thrashing.

740
00:48:09,690 --> 00:48:11,470
I may not get lucky again.

741
00:48:11,690 --> 00:48:14,350
Have some faith in the expert.

742
00:48:14,530 --> 00:48:15,580
Don't worry.

743
00:48:15,870 --> 00:48:17,370
Everything is fine, Murari.

744
00:48:17,450 --> 00:48:18,640
It was fine.

745
00:48:20,990 --> 00:48:23,490
Damn!

746
00:48:24,470 --> 00:48:26,840
What the...

747
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:40,390
What are you doing?

748
00:48:40,550 --> 00:48:42,880
He's my brother-in-law.
Let go of his collar.

749
00:48:43,050 --> 00:48:44,470
But, not him.

750
00:48:46,170 --> 00:48:48,300
Brother-in-law,
do you have wings on your feet?

751
00:48:49,550 --> 00:48:52,510
You run a lot and
make us run behind you.

752
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:04,340
What's to be done, brother?
Beat his friend.

753
00:49:04,630 --> 00:49:07,470
I'm innocent.

754
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:10,170
For example...
hit him.

755
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:12,470
Listen... wait...

756
00:49:12,590 --> 00:49:14,670
what are you doing?

757
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:15,840
Gently.

758
00:49:15,950 --> 00:49:17,190
Enough.

759
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:20,260
He's saying something.
At least listen to him.

760
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,920
You don't understand words.

761
00:49:23,170 --> 00:49:24,510
Maybe bullets?

762
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:26,330
Goodbye.

763
00:49:26,740 --> 00:49:28,080
What's this?

764
00:49:47,550 --> 00:49:50,200
- What's this, sister?
- Were you to stop him or kill him?

765
00:49:50,380 --> 00:49:52,760
- But...
- It's between my husband and me.

766
00:49:52,910 --> 00:49:54,270
Everyone, get lost.

767
00:49:54,350 --> 00:49:56,970
- Brother-in-law...
- Go!

768
00:49:57,380 --> 00:50:00,510
Half my problems are due to you.

769
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:02,300
Give it.

770
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:06,220
Neither a lover, nor a wife...

771
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:08,730
I've become a fool for you.

772
00:50:10,010 --> 00:50:13,170
I want to blow your brains out
and become a widow.

773
00:50:13,340 --> 00:50:14,960
Should I?

774
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:20,960
Kill me.

775
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:23,250
Kill me.

776
00:50:24,470 --> 00:50:26,920
Death is better than this life.

777
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:34,760
I can't live with your brother's
obligation and his threats.

778
00:50:35,950 --> 00:50:39,080
I can't live like this...
I love you.

779
00:50:39,990 --> 00:50:42,300
I was so ashamed!

780
00:50:43,530 --> 00:50:44,990
I ran because I needed some time.

781
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:49,720
I thought I'd make something of myself
and return to my Chanda.

782
00:50:51,490 --> 00:50:54,430
You haven't done anything
for me to trust you.

783
00:50:55,510 --> 00:50:57,620
Yet... how much time do you need?

784
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:00,270
It's a government tender.

785
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:02,780
And they want a hefty bribe.

786
00:51:03,090 --> 00:51:04,110
I can't confirm.

787
00:51:04,510 --> 00:51:06,090
As soon as I save some money,

788
00:51:06,170 --> 00:51:09,510
I'll get the paperwork going
and come rushing back into your arms.

789
00:51:09,670 --> 00:51:11,770
How much do you want?

790
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:17,800
I'll make do with 1.5 lakh...

791
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:21,470
Dulaare, give me 2 lakhs.

792
00:51:21,590 --> 00:51:23,940
Sis, how do I dispense it?
I'm not an ATM machine.

793
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:25,510
Wait.

794
00:51:28,090 --> 00:51:30,030
This is all I have.

795
00:51:31,590 --> 00:51:35,550
Brother, check with the others, too.

796
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:36,800
Give it.

797
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:38,460
Out with it.

798
00:51:46,420 --> 00:51:48,040
It's a bit less...

799
00:51:48,350 --> 00:51:52,420
might take a couple of
months more but I'll manage.

800
00:52:08,830 --> 00:52:09,830
Thank you.

801
00:52:11,860 --> 00:52:12,860
15 days.

802
00:52:13,510 --> 00:52:19,450
I give you 15 days to wrap up
your things and settle down with me.

803
00:52:20,340 --> 00:52:22,800
Otherwise, I'll destroy you
with my own hands.

804
00:52:23,010 --> 00:52:24,010
Fine.

805
00:52:24,130 --> 00:52:25,130
15 days.

806
00:52:25,170 --> 00:52:26,830
Should I get the car?

807
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:34,260
Can I leave?

808
00:52:42,470 --> 00:52:43,880
What proof do you have, madam?

809
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,040
The sacred vows we took
during our marriage is the proof.

810
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:51,210
And this locket that Bhola
gifted me on our wedding.

811
00:52:51,510 --> 00:52:53,400
Vows and locket!

812
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:57,210
What nonsense. I can't arrest
anyone on these grounds.

813
00:52:57,390 --> 00:52:59,800
It would be best if he'd been
arrested that day itself.

814
00:52:59,970 --> 00:53:01,590
I'm so stupid to get swayed by him!

815
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:03,050
He has disappeared.

816
00:53:03,130 --> 00:53:06,130
He isn't even answering
his phone now.

817
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:14,010
Hello... yes, Durgalal.

818
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:16,150
Your niece was here.

819
00:53:16,630 --> 00:53:18,300
She spilled the beans against Bhola.

820
00:53:18,460 --> 00:53:20,910
When I explained it to you
You didn't believe me.

821
00:53:20,990 --> 00:53:22,810
Forget it.

822
00:53:23,180 --> 00:53:25,110
Let's catch him now.

823
00:53:25,190 --> 00:53:27,590
- We have evidence.
- No, Durgalal...

824
00:53:28,030 --> 00:53:29,720
Don't do anything.
Understand?

825
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:32,090
He's very smart.
He's a tough nut.

826
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:33,930
I'll have to do something.

827
00:53:34,570 --> 00:53:36,250
Stay ready.

828
00:53:36,430 --> 00:53:38,280
I'll throw the bait, you catch him.

829
00:53:38,370 --> 00:53:39,640
Bye.

830
00:53:43,570 --> 00:53:47,510
Forget 2 million,
I won't let you take a single penny.

831
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:51,260
Come on.

832
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:52,450
Let's go.

833
00:53:57,630 --> 00:54:00,700
At least tell me the strategy.

834
00:54:01,010 --> 00:54:03,260
- I'm thinking about it.
- What?

835
00:54:03,670 --> 00:54:08,170
Have you seen my face?
First think and then knock.

836
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:12,300
You?

837
00:54:12,380 --> 00:54:13,590
- Please move!
- Namaste.

838
00:54:13,670 --> 00:54:16,050
Where are you barging in...
you swine!

839
00:54:16,260 --> 00:54:17,510
Mala!

840
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:20,170
Mala!

841
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:25,260
You runaway maggot,
what do you want now?

842
00:54:27,090 --> 00:54:30,520
Madam, let him speak...

843
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:44,670
It's been 1.5 years,

844
00:54:45,220 --> 00:54:48,550
two months and 21 days
since your husband went missing...

845
00:54:48,950 --> 00:54:51,120
and you are chilling here?

846
00:54:51,970 --> 00:54:55,670
Did you even once try
and look for me?

847
00:54:57,300 --> 00:55:00,510
Know whether
I was living or dead?

848
00:55:02,050 --> 00:55:04,980
Why couldn't you
get to the hospital I was in?

849
00:55:06,380 --> 00:55:07,510
Hospital?

850
00:55:07,930 --> 00:55:11,170
I met with an accident.

851
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:15,540
I was so happy to
hear about the baby...

852
00:55:15,830 --> 00:55:18,860
that I wanted to
come running back to you.

853
00:55:20,490 --> 00:55:22,760
I had bought a ring for you.

854
00:55:39,050 --> 00:55:41,650
Oh damn!

855
00:55:42,150 --> 00:55:43,260
Brother, what did you do?

856
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:45,390
- It's nothing...
- Let me see...

857
00:55:45,590 --> 00:55:47,720
I had a little bump yesterday...

858
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:49,050
Just a minute.

859
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:50,220
A little...

860
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:51,300
Look up.

861
00:55:51,610 --> 00:55:53,090
Come on.

862
00:55:54,810 --> 00:55:55,880
It won't burn.

863
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:57,760
- You're getting me scared, too.
- No!

864
00:55:59,510 --> 00:56:02,350
- Done.
- Thank you.

865
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:04,510
What're you doing?

866
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:07,050
I seek blessings
from my older brother.

867
00:56:08,050 --> 00:56:10,470
No no... I am not your older brother.

868
00:56:10,620 --> 00:56:12,500
For me you are an older brother.

869
00:56:16,510 --> 00:56:17,920
Such a cute child.

870
00:56:18,050 --> 00:56:19,550
What's his name?

871
00:56:19,740 --> 00:56:20,980
What's your name?

872
00:56:21,170 --> 00:56:22,550
His name's Munna.

873
00:56:23,010 --> 00:56:24,780
Munna, go to your uncle.

874
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:25,510
No...

875
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:27,460
Here... hold him.

876
00:56:29,450 --> 00:56:30,790
Munna...

877
00:56:31,090 --> 00:56:32,220
What a cutie!

878
00:56:32,340 --> 00:56:33,920
Here you are..!

879
00:56:34,590 --> 00:56:36,260
I'll get you some tea.

880
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:38,170
Stay with uncle.

881
00:56:38,550 --> 00:56:39,830
Excuse me...

882
00:56:57,630 --> 00:56:59,610
What are you thinking about?

883
00:57:00,450 --> 00:57:02,450
Both of you.

884
00:57:04,470 --> 00:57:06,350
I can't take care of you...

885
00:57:07,050 --> 00:57:09,720
can't cope with the expense
of his upbringing.

886
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:12,950
I should've died in that accident.

887
00:57:13,260 --> 00:57:16,130
God forbid!

888
00:57:18,630 --> 00:57:21,010
Our family has
reunited after so long.

889
00:57:21,170 --> 00:57:22,720
We're so happy.

890
00:57:22,970 --> 00:57:27,090
Instead of money, you should be
thinking about us.

891
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:30,970
I can give up millions
for this moment.

892
00:57:32,130 --> 00:57:34,910
I don't have a penny
and you talk of millions.

893
00:57:37,390 --> 00:57:39,800
- I'll be right back.
- Where're you going?

894
00:57:41,630 --> 00:57:42,930
Coming!

895
00:57:55,870 --> 00:57:57,560
- What's this?
- Open it.

896
00:57:57,720 --> 00:57:58,750
I am.

897
00:57:59,130 --> 00:58:01,080
Quickly!

898
00:58:05,300 --> 00:58:06,880
So much cash?

899
00:58:07,850 --> 00:58:11,290
Mala, if you've done anything wrong,
tell me and I'll forgive you.

900
00:58:11,490 --> 00:58:12,510
Are you mad?

901
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:14,920
I've won the lottery!

902
00:58:15,340 --> 00:58:16,490
Lottery?

903
00:58:17,390 --> 00:58:19,390
Come on, child...
pee on me.

904
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:22,260
- Really?
- 2 million.

905
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:24,740
You can't believe it right,
touch it and see.

906
00:58:25,260 --> 00:58:28,080
- I can't even see so much cash.
- Oh no!

907
00:58:29,770 --> 00:58:30,970
What have you done?

908
00:58:31,130 --> 00:58:32,830
Just a minute, brother.

909
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:34,590
Look at what he's done.

910
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:38,020
Munna, you've
sprinkled uncle with holy water.

911
00:58:38,220 --> 00:58:39,720
He's soiled my shirt.

912
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:40,930
Take it off.

913
00:58:41,010 --> 00:58:42,720
I'll iron it for you.

914
00:58:44,130 --> 00:58:45,470
No... please do this instead.

915
00:58:45,550 --> 00:58:46,340
No, child...

916
00:58:46,510 --> 00:58:50,070
This is a very important
paper for Bholaji.

917
00:58:50,300 --> 00:58:51,920
Please iron it.

918
00:58:54,390 --> 00:58:55,670
Quiet.

919
00:58:55,830 --> 00:58:59,580
The child peed on me.

920
00:59:00,010 --> 00:59:02,960
Murari, forget the shirt.
I'll get you a suit.

921
00:59:03,260 --> 00:59:07,510
Partner, I don't think
it's a good idea.

922
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:09,550
Two million is no small amount.

923
00:59:09,630 --> 00:59:10,720
We'll get caught.

924
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:12,970
- The cops will flog us.
- Murari...

925
00:59:14,590 --> 00:59:19,130
I'm flying off tomorrow...
abroad.

926
00:59:20,420 --> 00:59:21,540
Don't worry.

927
00:59:46,370 --> 00:59:47,820
Move!

928
00:59:56,210 --> 00:59:57,990
Stop!

929
01:00:01,380 --> 01:00:03,710
I'm sorry.
I can't run anymore.

930
01:00:03,880 --> 01:00:06,520
Fool!
Can't you do anything properly?

931
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:09,930
How did the paper reach her?
I had it in my shirt pocket.

932
01:00:10,010 --> 01:00:12,260
Everything was fine until
your son peed on me.

933
01:00:12,340 --> 01:00:13,830
- What to do?
- I've lost two million.

934
01:00:13,910 --> 01:00:16,960
I'm new to the World of Fraud.

935
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:19,880
It was a rookie mistake, brother.

936
01:00:20,070 --> 01:00:22,270
You are such a bad luck!

937
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:25,340
You've caused serious damage.

938
01:00:28,090 --> 01:00:33,690
That was the plan, boss

939
01:00:45,340 --> 01:00:46,880
Murari...

940
01:00:47,340 --> 01:00:48,340
You...

941
01:00:49,220 --> 01:00:53,380
Where ever I go I get beaten up
because of you...

942
01:00:53,850 --> 01:00:55,610
so I've decided
to disguised myself...

943
01:00:55,690 --> 01:00:58,420
so that in case we have
to run nobody can catch us.

944
01:00:58,830 --> 01:01:00,050
Even I keep getting beaten up.

Bhola.

985
01:04:21,550 --> 01:04:22,550
Paro (JULIET)

986
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,000
Paro? (JULIET)

987
01:04:34,290 --> 01:04:36,370
I will return all your money

988
01:04:36,710 --> 01:04:37,710
Money?

989
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:40,070
Did I even ask for it?

990
01:04:40,840 --> 01:04:43,190
You don’t even remember my name

991
01:04:44,620 --> 01:04:46,860
Forgotten your beloved chandni?

992
01:04:48,510 --> 01:04:49,820
I said Paro (JULIET) because...

993
01:04:49,900 --> 01:04:52,086
I meant you are Paro (JULIET)
and I m your devdas (ROMEO).

994
01:04:52,110 --> 01:04:53,110
Ok.

995
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:55,400
How could I forget my beloved chandni.

996
01:04:55,660 --> 01:05:00,150
I looked for you every city...

997
01:05:01,650 --> 01:05:02,860
Every lane...

998
01:05:03,330 --> 01:05:05,260
Every website, every app.

999
01:05:05,410 --> 01:05:06,920
Looked for you all over
the internet.

1000
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,530
Why aren’t you on face book?

1001
01:05:10,630 --> 01:05:11,630
I am.

1002
01:05:14,210 --> 01:05:15,650
Should I send you a friend request?

1003
01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:21,520
Do you need my permission
for anything.

1004
01:05:25,470 --> 01:05:27,590
Should I follow you on Instagram?

1005
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,290
Do it Bhola ji.

1006
01:05:29,930 --> 01:05:30,930
Twitter?

1007
01:05:31,300 --> 01:05:32,540
Do it Bhola ji.

1008
01:05:32,700 --> 01:05:34,030
Snapchat?

1009
01:05:34,180 --> 01:05:34,990
Do it.

1010
01:05:35,150 --> 01:05:36,150
Tinder?

1011
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:37,100
Do it.

1012
01:05:37,260 --> 01:05:38,260
Flip kart?

1013
01:05:38,430 --> 01:05:39,110
Do it.

1014
01:05:39,300 --> 01:05:40,340
Big bazaar?

1015
01:05:40,540 --> 01:05:41,540
Please do it.

1016
01:05:41,590 --> 01:05:42,330
Olx?

1017
01:05:42,500 --> 01:05:43,130
Please do it.

1018
01:05:43,260 --> 01:05:44,260
Make my trip.

1019
01:05:44,730 --> 01:05:45,980
Make my trip!

1020
01:05:46,100 --> 01:05:47,300
- Please do it.
- Make my trip.

1021
01:05:47,700 --> 01:05:48,700
Do it please!

1022
01:05:53,250 --> 01:05:54,250
Who the hell are you?

1023
01:05:54,390 --> 01:05:55,390
I'm her husband.

1024
01:05:57,540 --> 01:05:58,540
Sorry...

1025
01:06:08,410 --> 01:06:11,940
How dare you look at another man

1026
01:06:14,370 --> 01:06:17,500
And is it ok if other men
sit and look at me the whole day?

1027
01:06:22,410 --> 01:06:24,840
He makes me dance
wearing these clothes.

1028
01:06:26,510 --> 01:06:29,090
You make Chandani dance in your bar.

1029
01:06:29,170 --> 01:06:30,170
Cheap!

1030
01:06:30,310 --> 01:06:31,310
How cheap!

1031
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:34,690
What are you looking at!!
Arrest them.!

1032
01:06:34,820 --> 01:06:36,440
Wait a minute.

1033
01:06:37,080 --> 01:06:38,760
For what?

1034
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:40,330
Who the hell are you?

1035
01:06:41,510 --> 01:06:42,510
He is...

1036
01:06:43,640 --> 01:06:46,450
He is my lawyer...
very big lair

1037
01:06:48,030 --> 01:06:49,030
Greetings

1038
01:06:49,460 --> 01:06:53,850
Now tell me on what ground
do you want to arrest them?

1039
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:55,510
For adulatory.

1040
01:06:56,500 --> 01:06:58,510
Under section 497.

1041
01:07:03,190 --> 01:07:09,080
Don’t you know the Supreme Court
has cancelled the section 497.

1042
01:07:16,740 --> 01:07:19,420
Brother listen...

1043
01:07:20,740 --> 01:07:25,100
adulatory is no more a
crime only if its consensual.

1044
01:07:26,370 --> 01:07:28,000
He had my consent...

1045
01:07:29,110 --> 01:07:31,940
not him, but I touched him..

1046
01:07:33,290 --> 01:07:34,960
Wow!

1047
01:07:36,220 --> 01:07:37,370
Now wait and watch...

1048
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:38,990
the way I treat you...

1049
01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:41,010
I will ruin you …

1050
01:07:41,240 --> 01:07:44,000
Don’t you know all the property
and the papers belong to me.

1051
01:07:44,150 --> 01:07:46,250
You are going to get nothing from it.

1052
01:07:46,500 --> 01:07:48,070
She needs it.

1053
01:07:49,550 --> 01:07:52,400
Brother she doesn’t
even care for5 your money

1054
01:07:52,980 --> 01:07:54,890
She cares only for him.

1055
01:07:55,350 --> 01:07:56,070
.Yes

1056
01:07:56,220 --> 01:07:57,710
She will go with Bhola ji.

1057
01:07:58,050 --> 01:07:58,570
Yes.

1058
01:07:58,650 --> 01:07:59,920
She will marry him.

1059
01:08:00,060 --> 01:08:00,590
Correct.

1060
01:08:00,670 --> 01:08:02,066
She doesn’t need
your money for that.

1061
01:08:02,090 --> 01:08:03,090
Yes.

1062
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:05,240
Yes

1063
01:08:05,600 --> 01:08:06,140
Correct.

1064
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:07,790
Then they will settle down.

1065
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:11,540
Then they will live happily ever after.
They will have multiple children

1066
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:12,880
Yes.

1067
01:08:12,950 --> 01:08:16,920
They can live in poverty too.
So they don’t need your money.

1068
01:08:18,010 --> 01:08:19,010
Yes.

1069
01:08:19,050 --> 01:08:19,560
Yes.

1070
01:08:19,990 --> 01:08:20,560
Yes.

1071
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:21,740
Let's go bhola ji-

1072
01:08:33,540 --> 01:08:34,970
Look-

1073
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:37,650
I'm-

1074
01:08:39,570 --> 01:08:40,570
I'm-

1075
01:08:49,580 --> 01:08:51,280
So what were you saying?

1076
01:08:59,390 --> 01:09:02,600
From where did
this idea come to you?

1077
01:09:04,790 --> 01:09:07,800
I've never mentioned it to anyone...

1078
01:09:10,450 --> 01:09:11,820
but I'll tell you.

1079
01:09:12,280 --> 01:09:14,260
'My father had a scrap magazine stall.'

1080
01:09:14,340 --> 01:09:17,430
'And in parallel, I used to run
the business in school.'

1081
01:09:17,510 --> 01:09:19,760
'A penny for a peek.'

1082
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:21,420
'One buck for legs only.'

1083
01:09:21,550 --> 01:09:24,130
'In the meantime,
I fell in love with Srishti.'

1084
01:09:33,580 --> 01:09:36,750
The questions were so tough.

1085
01:09:45,260 --> 01:09:46,260
Say it for me.

1086
01:09:46,410 --> 01:09:50,120
I've told you so many times
to leave me alone.

1087
01:09:55,590 --> 01:09:56,590
Srishti.

1088
01:09:57,660 --> 01:09:58,660
Srishti.

1089
01:10:00,260 --> 01:10:02,090
- Leave me.
- I won't.

1090
01:10:02,220 --> 01:10:04,420
- Let me go.
- No!

1091
01:10:04,840 --> 01:10:06,180
- I'll tell my father.
- Tell him.

1092
01:10:06,260 --> 01:10:09,010
But, you have to tell me 'I love you'.

1093
01:10:17,170 --> 01:10:19,890
'I was so charged that
I married her symbolically...'

1094
01:10:19,970 --> 01:10:24,790
'but couldn't sleep a wink wondering
what would happen the next morning.'

1095
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:30,850
'The mountain I created
was actually a molehill!'

1096
01:10:31,570 --> 01:10:34,100
Please eat your lunch.

1097
01:10:34,770 --> 01:10:38,450
'That one act set me up for life.'

1098
01:10:39,050 --> 01:10:43,420
'That's when I realized that
this was the best job.'

1099
01:10:44,150 --> 01:10:48,470
'Marry a woman and
you will never need a job.'

1100
01:10:49,740 --> 01:10:52,310
Then I've decided.

1101
01:10:52,610 --> 01:10:54,900
I will not say, 'I love you.'

1102
01:10:55,430 --> 01:10:58,540
I will say, 'Will you marry me?'

1103
01:11:01,260 --> 01:11:05,280
You're as cunning as a fox.

1104
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:10,010
Means you take their money
But not their responsibility.

1105
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:12,670
What responsibility?

1106
01:11:13,030 --> 01:11:15,920
I just need to collect some cash.

1107
01:11:17,090 --> 01:11:19,880
And shift abroad..

1108
01:11:20,340 --> 01:11:22,360
How will you go?

1109
01:11:22,740 --> 01:11:26,270
Of the 15 days granted by Chanda,
one has been wasted.

1110
01:11:26,820 --> 01:11:30,010
And Mala is no longer an option.

1111
01:11:30,630 --> 01:11:33,390
You don't know me yet, Murari.

1112
01:11:33,780 --> 01:11:39,170
I'm still that stubborn child.

1113
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:42,460
If she's goes,
The next one will come.

1114
01:11:42,830 --> 01:11:45,360
If she goes as well,
another one will come.

1115
01:11:45,970 --> 01:11:50,550
Our country has too many options.

1116
01:11:51,380 --> 01:11:53,470
You're very talented.

1117
01:11:56,620 --> 01:11:58,840
That's the spirit.

1118
01:11:59,820 --> 01:12:03,720
Murari, the gap between one peg
and another shouldn't be too much.

1119
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:05,070
Step on it.

1120
01:12:05,380 --> 01:12:09,800
Sure... but I need
to find the keys first.

1121
01:12:10,010 --> 01:12:17,910
Keys... of a rich girl's vault
would be perfect right now.

1122
01:12:18,170 --> 01:12:20,730
Patience, my friend.

1123
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:21,920
Right.

1124
01:12:23,460 --> 01:12:24,660
We are done.

1125
01:12:24,990 --> 01:12:27,170
I've got 15 days from your sister.

1126
01:12:27,330 --> 01:12:27,980
Right.

1127
01:12:28,220 --> 01:12:33,880
But, sister forgot to tell you that
you have to report to her everyday.

1128
01:12:34,050 --> 01:12:35,220
What? How?

1129
01:12:35,340 --> 01:12:38,510
The same way you visit
the temple everyday.

1130
01:12:38,590 --> 01:12:41,290
You must pay your respect
to my sister the same way.

1131
01:12:41,460 --> 01:12:44,090
We're traveling to different cities.
How's it possible?

1132
01:12:44,170 --> 01:12:47,130
Don't give me any explanations.
I'm following her orders.

1133
01:12:47,260 --> 01:12:49,130
Call your sister.
I'll talk to her.

1134
01:12:49,260 --> 01:12:50,810
- Oh, man!
- What nonsense.

1135
01:12:50,890 --> 01:12:51,590
Right.

1136
01:12:51,670 --> 01:12:54,300
Sis, he's arguing about
the daily reporting.

1137
01:12:55,590 --> 01:12:56,970
Yes...

1138
01:12:57,550 --> 01:12:58,590
Fine.

1139
01:12:59,010 --> 01:13:02,560
If you can't meet sister
then you have to send me and her,

1140
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:03,760
a selfie everyday.

1141
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:05,526
So first take a selfie
with your beloved brother-in-law.

1142
01:13:05,550 --> 01:13:06,550
Come.

1143
01:13:06,590 --> 01:13:07,920
Smile!

1144
01:13:08,720 --> 01:13:09,920
Very good.

1145
01:13:12,890 --> 01:13:14,590
How can I ignore it, Murari.

1146
01:13:15,010 --> 01:13:18,740
Sunita and Shraddha are
out of the picture.

1147
01:13:20,470 --> 01:13:22,640
I lost the two million...

1148
01:13:23,340 --> 01:13:27,240
and this witch Chanda has me
where it hurts the most.

1149
01:13:28,340 --> 01:13:30,210
The game I used to be king at...

1150
01:13:30,510 --> 01:13:32,540
I've become a Joker in the pack

1151
01:13:33,550 --> 01:13:38,580
Your destiny is
changing my friend.

1152
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:42,170
You've ruined so many lives, Its
time for you to face the music now.

1153
01:13:42,260 --> 01:13:43,260
Ruined?

1154
01:13:43,300 --> 01:13:43,970
I mean...

1155
01:13:44,110 --> 01:13:46,760
You talk about stuff
you know nothing of.

1156
01:13:47,030 --> 01:13:48,170
What have I ruined?

1157
01:13:48,470 --> 01:13:51,330
One wasn't getting married,
one's lover left her,

1158
01:13:51,590 --> 01:13:52,720
another was divorced.

1159
01:13:53,670 --> 01:13:55,640
I've given them a reason to live.

1160
01:13:55,720 --> 01:13:56,790
Understood?

1161
01:13:57,020 --> 01:14:00,020
So what if I took
some money from them?

1162
01:14:00,370 --> 01:14:03,480
Why are people judging me?
I'm spreading joy... for free.

1163
01:14:03,870 --> 01:14:06,340
You talk about ruining lives...

1164
01:14:08,170 --> 01:14:12,050
Boss, tell me something truthfully.

1165
01:14:13,270 --> 01:14:15,740
You found so many women,

1166
01:14:16,020 --> 01:14:20,470
lived with so many...
didn't you ever fall in love?

1167
01:14:23,670 --> 01:14:27,800
Murari, love has ruined
the mightiest of men.

1168
01:14:29,130 --> 01:14:31,110
I won't make that mistake.

1169
01:14:31,320 --> 01:14:32,530
Never.

1170
01:14:34,470 --> 01:14:36,590
You'll lead a lonely life my friend.

1171
01:14:45,970 --> 01:14:46,970
Hello.

1172
01:14:54,950 --> 01:14:55,950
Fine.

1173
01:15:07,030 --> 01:15:09,010
Where the hell have you got me?

1174
01:15:09,280 --> 01:15:10,290
Hospital.

1175
01:15:10,720 --> 01:15:12,920
There's nothing wrong with me.
Why are we at a hospital?

1176
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:14,180
It's me.

1177
01:15:14,820 --> 01:15:17,130
I've got acute pain in my chest.

1178
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:20,220
I've got a heart attack.

1179
01:15:20,300 --> 01:15:21,900
You were fine five minutes ago.

1180
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:28,250
Stop over acting Murari.

1181
01:15:29,090 --> 01:15:30,840
Oh, the pain!

1182
01:15:30,970 --> 01:15:32,630
What did you eat
for breakfast today?

1183
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:34,970
A lot of greasy food, doctor.

1184
01:15:35,050 --> 01:15:36,450
That's horrible.

1185
01:15:36,630 --> 01:15:39,510
You should be eating salad
tomatoes, cucumber...

1186
01:15:39,630 --> 01:15:42,600
Doctor, you're sounding like
a vegetable vendor.

1187
01:15:42,680 --> 01:15:44,656
Give him some medicine.
Why are you selling him vegetables?

1188
01:15:44,680 --> 01:15:46,510
Doc, don't listen to him.

1189
01:15:46,680 --> 01:15:49,070
I feel I'm getting
a major heart attack.

1190
01:15:49,150 --> 01:15:51,310
Nothing's wrong with him.
I think he's got acidity.

1191
01:15:51,390 --> 01:15:53,170
Fart a few times
and you'll be fine.

1192
01:15:53,250 --> 01:15:55,770
What nonsense!

1193
01:15:55,930 --> 01:15:57,570
If farting could solve all problems,

1194
01:15:57,650 --> 01:15:59,300
everyone would be
a farting the whole day.

1195
01:15:59,480 --> 01:16:01,380
Doc, check me properly.

1196
01:16:01,930 --> 01:16:04,250
I know you have a lot of money madam

1197
01:16:04,510 --> 01:16:07,870
You millions are no good
for finding your husband.

1198
01:16:08,130 --> 01:16:11,010
- He would be dead by now.
- Please don't say that.

1199
01:16:11,260 --> 01:16:13,510
You can at least try again.

1200
01:16:13,660 --> 01:16:16,380
Madam, the car fell from 500 feet
into the river and crashed to bits.

1201
01:16:16,530 --> 01:16:18,930
If the car couldn't survive the fall,
how could your husband?

1202
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:23,550
Who knows where
the body may have floated.

1203
01:16:23,690 --> 01:16:25,680
Console yourself and take care.

1204
01:16:28,510 --> 01:16:33,160
A firefly's backside and
Bhola's destiny can shine anytime!

1205
01:16:41,080 --> 01:16:42,330
Hello, Payalji.

1206
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:46,300
I'm so sorry to hear
about your husband.

1207
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:51,160
We met in the train.

1208
01:16:51,340 --> 01:16:53,650
Cold coffee... tea...

1209
01:16:58,090 --> 01:16:59,270
Bholaji.

1210
01:17:01,550 --> 01:17:04,520
I met Badriji only once.

1211
01:17:05,300 --> 01:17:07,410
He was such a good man.

1212
01:17:08,090 --> 01:17:09,350
Don't worry.

1213
01:17:09,550 --> 01:17:11,030
Everything will be fine.

1214
01:17:17,640 --> 01:17:19,830
I understand what you
must be going through.

1215
01:17:20,170 --> 01:17:21,840
But don't you worry.

1216
01:17:22,910 --> 01:17:23,950
I'm here.

1217
01:17:30,470 --> 01:17:33,270
'So my arrangement to leave
the country is taken care of.'

1218
01:17:33,590 --> 01:17:37,680
'It's time to switch from Bhola to
Rana Bhola pratap Singh.'

1219
01:18:29,630 --> 01:18:30,790
Yes?

1220
01:18:31,410 --> 01:18:32,510
Is Payalji there?

1221
01:18:32,590 --> 01:18:34,010
And yourself?

1222
01:18:35,090 --> 01:18:36,840
Rana Bhola Pratap Singh.

1223
01:18:37,220 --> 01:18:40,070
I've got her some fruits.

1224
01:18:40,720 --> 01:18:42,540
If you could please
give them to her...

1225
01:18:43,280 --> 01:18:44,390
Come in.

1226
01:18:52,450 --> 01:18:53,840
Hello.

1227
01:18:54,720 --> 01:18:58,000
I have some orchards in Kashmir.

1228
01:18:58,340 --> 01:19:01,190
The apples are from there
and I thought you might like some.

1229
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:04,560
There was no need for this...
Please sit.

1230
01:19:04,810 --> 01:19:06,060
Thank you.

1231
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:12,340
So... how are you?

1232
01:19:12,700 --> 01:19:13,700
Fine.

1233
01:19:17,630 --> 01:19:19,970
Sorry.
Just a minute.

1234
01:19:28,160 --> 01:19:29,220
Hello, Bholaji.

1235
01:19:29,400 --> 01:19:30,190
Yes.

1236
01:19:30,330 --> 01:19:35,500
It's been 3-4 days...
I'm missing you lots.

1237
01:19:37,300 --> 01:19:39,470
I'm busy.
We'll talk later.

1238
01:19:39,680 --> 01:19:40,730
What?

1239
01:19:41,630 --> 01:19:42,720
First give me a kiss.

1240
01:19:42,870 --> 01:19:44,820
Only then will I put down the phone.

1241
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:46,690
I told you, I'm busy.

1242
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:47,880
I'll call you later.

1243
01:19:48,010 --> 01:19:49,880
First the kiss.

1244
01:19:50,010 --> 01:19:51,500
I'll hang up after that.

1245
01:19:57,560 --> 01:19:59,180
Fine? Bye.

1246
01:20:00,510 --> 01:20:02,700
Some apple was stuck in my teeth...

1247
01:20:03,210 --> 01:20:04,510
Eat something, child.

1248
01:20:04,590 --> 01:20:06,270
You haven't eaten anything
since yesterday.

1249
01:20:06,380 --> 01:20:07,970
What? You haven't eaten anything

1250
01:20:08,430 --> 01:20:09,540
That's bad.

1251
01:20:10,590 --> 01:20:12,300
Sit.
I'll get you something.

1252
01:20:20,470 --> 01:20:21,630
Here, eat.

1253
01:20:22,380 --> 01:20:23,510
No.

1254
01:20:26,580 --> 01:20:30,150
I know it's difficult to
live without someone you love.

1255
01:20:30,620 --> 01:20:32,840
But, why are you angry
with the food?

1256
01:20:33,050 --> 01:20:34,510
Please eat.

1257
01:20:35,350 --> 01:20:36,590
Here it is.

1258
01:20:37,150 --> 01:20:38,160
Have some.

1259
01:20:48,220 --> 01:20:49,430
Enough.

1260
01:20:50,390 --> 01:20:51,670
No way.

1261
01:20:51,830 --> 01:20:53,566
There's a still a bite
for the rest of the family.

1262
01:20:53,590 --> 01:20:54,850
That was only grandpa.

1263
01:20:55,010 --> 01:20:57,090
There's grandma, gramps...

1264
01:20:57,760 --> 01:21:00,270
That's how I talk to the kids
in my school.

1265
01:21:01,410 --> 01:21:02,580
Are You a teacher?

1266
01:21:05,870 --> 01:21:08,800
You act like a child though.

1267
01:21:09,800 --> 01:21:10,930
Eat.

1268
01:21:14,300 --> 01:21:15,510
That's it.

1269
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:09,720
Bholaji...
I want to say something to you.

1270
01:22:11,020 --> 01:22:15,690
This is our last meeting.

1271
01:22:19,220 --> 01:22:21,320
I don't want anyone to malign me,

1272
01:22:21,870 --> 01:22:25,190
hearing which husband's
soul will get hurt.

1273
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:29,850
Please don't come home.

1274
01:22:31,660 --> 01:22:33,850
If that's what you want.

1275
01:22:34,600 --> 01:22:37,730
I don't want to make
a mockery of your pain.

1276
01:22:44,120 --> 01:22:45,120
Bye.

1277
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:47,000
Take care.

1278
01:22:54,630 --> 01:22:59,010
Murari, is this a
criminal case or a game?

1279
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:00,430
When will we catch Bhola?

1280
01:23:00,550 --> 01:23:04,110
We have already got him...
just need to pin him down.

1281
01:23:04,700 --> 01:23:06,260
I don't get it.

1282
01:23:08,060 --> 01:23:11,750
He is here. Get lost before
he sees you. I'll meet you soon.

1283
01:23:21,240 --> 01:23:23,370
So Bhola Rana pratap Singh,

1284
01:23:24,220 --> 01:23:26,300
you've already lost
six of the 15 days...

1285
01:23:26,380 --> 01:23:27,730
that Chanda had given you.

1286
01:23:27,980 --> 01:23:32,550
And she fires more
bullets than words.

1287
01:23:32,680 --> 01:23:33,780
Do something!

1288
01:23:34,300 --> 01:23:38,910
All sorted...
from Chanda's warning...

1289
01:23:39,870 --> 01:23:41,590
to Payalji's good morning greetings.

1290
01:23:45,470 --> 01:23:47,050
What're we doing here?

1291
01:23:47,130 --> 01:23:48,810
Murari, we're waiting
for the right moment.

1292
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:51,820
Let me know when it comes.

1293
01:23:53,280 --> 01:23:55,790
- Where's my money?
- What are you saying?

1294
01:23:56,080 --> 01:23:57,140
What money?

1295
01:23:57,220 --> 01:23:59,340
Is something happening?

1296
01:24:00,740 --> 01:24:04,680
There's a thug-looking guy.

1297
01:24:05,530 --> 01:24:06,720
I think he's threatening her.

1298
01:24:06,870 --> 01:24:08,940
And what are you doing here?

1299
01:24:09,080 --> 01:24:11,140
Waiting for the right moment.

1300
01:24:11,330 --> 01:24:13,340
He'll threaten her and leave.
I'll go after.

1301
01:24:13,550 --> 01:24:14,770
Are you mad?

1302
01:24:14,970 --> 01:24:18,510
Slap the guy a bit
and become the girl's hero.

1303
01:24:19,720 --> 01:24:22,350
Do I look stupid to you?

1304
01:24:30,680 --> 01:24:32,380
- Go away!
- I won't.

1305
01:24:32,510 --> 01:24:34,810
What's happening here?

1306
01:24:35,130 --> 01:24:36,590
What do you want?

1307
01:24:36,680 --> 01:24:38,220
Who the hell are you?

1308
01:24:39,620 --> 01:24:40,970
I'm Rana Bhola Pratap Singh.

1309
01:24:41,050 --> 01:24:42,856
Now that we've been introduced,
get out of here.

1310
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:45,720
You're acting up because of these
new goons you've hired.

1311
01:24:45,910 --> 01:24:46,940
Get out!

1312
01:24:49,030 --> 01:24:51,090
- Who was he?
- I don't know.

1313
01:24:51,300 --> 01:24:56,260
Now that Badriji's not here,
he's harassing me.

1314
01:24:57,160 --> 01:24:58,640
If The debt was genuine,

1315
01:24:58,840 --> 01:25:00,196
I would've thrown
the money on his face.

1316
01:25:00,220 --> 01:25:01,970
But, he looked like a crook.

1317
01:25:02,380 --> 01:25:03,380
I'm sorry.

1318
01:25:03,510 --> 01:25:04,760
I didn't want to come here.

1319
01:25:04,840 --> 01:25:07,236
I was passing by and couldn't stop
myself when I saw what was happening.

1320
01:25:07,260 --> 01:25:08,260
I'm leaving.

1321
01:25:08,380 --> 01:25:11,980
Bholaji, won't you come inside.

1322
01:25:15,630 --> 01:25:17,230
If you insist.

1323
01:25:25,650 --> 01:25:26,760
My phone...

1324
01:25:30,780 --> 01:25:32,510
- Sorry.
- Take the call.

1325
01:25:32,590 --> 01:25:34,800
I'll make you some tea.

1326
01:25:35,090 --> 01:25:36,260
Thank you.

1327
01:25:45,580 --> 01:25:46,870
How are you, my love?

1328
01:25:47,160 --> 01:25:51,130
I want to give you
a big fat kiss.

1329
01:25:51,340 --> 01:25:52,760
I miss you!

1330
01:25:53,010 --> 01:25:54,690
Liar!

1331
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,760
My anger vanishes
when I hear you talk like that.

1332
01:25:58,070 --> 01:25:59,470
Today was my birthday.

1333
01:25:59,600 --> 01:26:01,480
You didn't even wish me.

1334
01:26:01,630 --> 01:26:03,590
What to do?
My watch is spoilt.

1335
01:26:03,810 --> 01:26:07,630
Please ask your father to get me
the new Rolex.

1336
01:26:07,870 --> 01:26:09,580
Happy birthday!

1337
01:26:09,810 --> 01:26:12,840
Please say what I love to hear...

1338
01:26:14,950 --> 01:26:19,830
My little chu-chi poochie face.

1339
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:21,630
Bye now.

1340
01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:23,220
Bye, bye.

1341
01:26:27,180 --> 01:26:28,290
I'll call you later.

1342
01:26:29,180 --> 01:26:30,810
Do You love kids?

1343
01:26:31,010 --> 01:26:33,550
Yes... that was my friend's daughter.

1344
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:37,880
She's naughty but really loves me.

1345
01:26:38,090 --> 01:26:39,770
You're such a wonderful person...

1346
01:26:39,910 --> 01:26:41,490
anyone can fall in love with you.

1347
01:26:42,010 --> 01:26:43,040
Except you.

1348
01:26:48,740 --> 01:26:53,130
Anyway, at least you think
I'm a wonderful person.

1349
01:26:58,340 --> 01:26:59,470
Thank you.

1350
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:08,240
I'm sorry I asked
you not to come home.

1351
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:14,406
I was worried about
what people would say.

1352
01:27:14,430 --> 01:27:16,220
And I hurt a dear friend like you.

1353
01:27:17,330 --> 01:27:18,970
What has this society given me?

1354
01:27:22,950 --> 01:27:24,780
Why are you looking at me like this?

1355
01:27:27,590 --> 01:27:28,670
Nothing...

1356
01:27:53,550 --> 01:27:58,350
Every morning you are in
and out of Payalji's house...

1357
01:27:58,430 --> 01:28:00,510
have you fallen in love with her?

1358
01:28:00,950 --> 01:28:03,400
Me falling in love?
Are you mad.

1359
01:28:30,430 --> 01:28:31,800
- Excuse me.
- Yes, sir?

1360
01:28:32,550 --> 01:28:33,300
Is Payalji here...

1361
01:28:33,380 --> 01:28:34,800
No one's here today.
It's a holiday.

1362
01:28:34,880 --> 01:28:35,890
Okay.

1363
01:28:39,590 --> 01:28:41,550
Payalji has disappeared
like a fart...

1364
01:28:41,840 --> 01:28:43,580
in thin air.

1365
01:28:45,180 --> 01:28:46,970
Couldn't you think
of a better example?

1366
01:28:47,300 --> 01:28:49,720
Such a beautiful woman.

1367
01:28:50,260 --> 01:28:51,270
Show some respect.

1368
01:28:51,430 --> 01:28:53,150
You're equating her to a stink.

1369
01:28:56,840 --> 01:28:58,220
Unbelievable.

1370
01:28:58,880 --> 01:29:02,700
He can't even take a joke.

1371
01:29:03,010 --> 01:29:03,680
Murari.

1372
01:29:03,760 --> 01:29:04,880
I'm coming.

1373
01:29:06,700 --> 01:29:08,540
I'll check the jewellery store.

1374
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:11,260
- Maybe she's here.
- Sure.

1375
01:29:19,010 --> 01:29:20,900
Bholaji!

1376
01:29:21,650 --> 01:29:22,920
Bholaji!

1377
01:29:30,190 --> 01:29:32,930
- Yes Aastha tell me!
- Where are you right now?

1378
01:29:33,760 --> 01:29:35,180
At the government office.

1379
01:29:35,300 --> 01:29:36,300
Where are you?

1380
01:29:36,360 --> 01:29:38,260
I am fasting tomorrow
for our long marriage..

1381
01:29:38,340 --> 01:29:39,500
So I'm shopping for it.

1382
01:29:39,660 --> 01:29:40,970
Alright.
I'll call you later.

1383
01:29:41,090 --> 01:29:42,560
Okay... bye.

1384
01:29:48,220 --> 01:29:50,110
So this is your government office.

1385
01:29:54,760 --> 01:29:56,210
What are you doing here?

1386
01:29:57,050 --> 01:29:59,380
Don't you have anything to say?

1387
01:30:02,280 --> 01:30:04,300
I told you we shouldn't
have come here.

1388
01:30:04,430 --> 01:30:06,326
You could think of only place
this place? We're caught now.

1389
01:30:06,350 --> 01:30:07,350
Shut up.

1390
01:30:07,580 --> 01:30:09,170
What are you doing here?

1391
01:30:09,990 --> 01:30:13,050
We are caught red-handed.
So I should tell you the truth.

1392
01:30:13,640 --> 01:30:18,300
You are fasting tommorow so I thought
I will buy you a surprise gift.

1393
01:30:19,660 --> 01:30:21,890
Now the surprise is ruined.

1394
01:30:22,550 --> 01:30:24,600
Anyway, this is Murari...
my partner.

1395
01:30:24,680 --> 01:30:25,610
Hello, Nirmitaji.

1396
01:30:25,690 --> 01:30:26,770
Namita.

1397
01:30:27,550 --> 01:30:29,610
Nirmita's good...
suits you better.

1398
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:30,776
You never get names right!

1399
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:32,680
From now on whenever
you meet her,

1400
01:30:32,760 --> 01:30:36,090
you'll address her as sister-in-law.

1401
01:30:36,300 --> 01:30:37,400
Hello, sister-in-law.

1402
01:30:37,970 --> 01:30:38,800
Hello.

1403
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:39,880
Hello.

1404
01:30:39,990 --> 01:30:41,300
Forget all this.

1405
01:30:41,380 --> 01:30:43,240
What's the surprise?

1406
01:30:48,160 --> 01:30:49,930
This ring is for you.

1407
01:30:50,940 --> 01:30:51,940
Like it?

1408
01:30:52,200 --> 01:30:53,460
It's beautiful.

1409
01:30:58,080 --> 01:31:00,500
Are You dieting a lot.
It's so loose for you.

1410
01:31:00,580 --> 01:31:02,630
Your fingers have become so thin.

1411
01:31:02,930 --> 01:31:05,010
I'll bring it back after refitting.

1412
01:31:05,090 --> 01:31:06,090
Okay?

1413
01:31:06,240 --> 01:31:07,290
I have to go now.

1414
01:31:07,370 --> 01:31:08,890
We have something
very important to do.

1415
01:31:08,930 --> 01:31:11,730
- Will you come tomorrow?
- Of course yes!

1416
01:31:14,820 --> 01:31:16,520
And be ready with...

1417
01:31:18,010 --> 01:31:18,860
What?

1418
01:31:18,990 --> 01:31:20,930
What I love the most.

1419
01:31:21,470 --> 01:31:22,580
What?

1420
01:31:22,930 --> 01:31:24,300
Naughty mood.

1421
01:31:38,120 --> 01:31:40,010
I'll see you tomorrow.

1422
01:31:40,830 --> 01:31:42,010
Bye.

1423
01:31:42,780 --> 01:31:44,380
- Be sure to come tomorrow.
- I will.

1424
01:31:44,470 --> 01:31:46,340
- Bye.
- Bye, sister-in-law.

1425
01:31:48,090 --> 01:31:50,760
Why did I get married to his sister?

1426
01:31:52,630 --> 01:31:57,260
So Brother-in-law, are you enjoying
with these butterflies?

1427
01:31:57,370 --> 01:31:58,880
Butterflies, what butterflies...

1428
01:31:59,020 --> 01:32:01,590
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Who was she?

1429
01:32:03,700 --> 01:32:05,130
His daughter.

1430
01:32:05,510 --> 01:32:07,130
Why were you hugging her?

1431
01:32:07,220 --> 01:32:09,430
She considers me her brother.
She adores me.

1432
01:32:09,760 --> 01:32:13,550
Tomorrow's an important fasting day.
I thought I'd buy her a gift.

1433
01:32:13,760 --> 01:32:15,840
And That woman from
the bungalow, who is she?

1434
01:32:15,920 --> 01:32:18,410
She works in the government officer.

1435
01:32:18,780 --> 01:32:20,156
She is helping me with the contract.

1436
01:32:20,180 --> 01:32:23,030
Brother-in-law, I don't care
about any contract.

1437
01:32:23,280 --> 01:32:25,086
But, if you don't come
back to my sister on time,

1438
01:32:25,110 --> 01:32:27,050
there will be consequences.

1439
01:32:27,220 --> 01:32:30,680
I'm might let you go but
if she gets mad, she'll kill you.

1440
01:32:30,760 --> 01:32:31,550
Boom!

1441
01:32:31,760 --> 01:32:33,740
And why ain't you sending
selfies these days?

1442
01:32:34,240 --> 01:32:37,300
My people are in every city.
You can send it from anywhere.

1443
01:32:38,050 --> 01:32:40,510
The biggest problem is that
you don't listen, brother-in-law.

1444
01:32:40,630 --> 01:32:42,540
You'll get thrashed
by me for it someday.

1445
01:32:44,090 --> 01:32:46,430
The phone...
he's my brother-in-law.

1446
01:32:47,880 --> 01:32:49,050
Come on.

1447
01:32:49,300 --> 01:32:51,190
Smile!

1448
01:32:58,050 --> 01:33:01,530
I've found everyone here
except for Payalji.

1449
01:33:02,680 --> 01:33:04,430
Where the hell are
we going to find her?

1450
01:33:04,760 --> 01:33:06,280
God knows.

1451
01:33:32,350 --> 01:33:34,170
Here she's come. Come on.

1452
01:33:40,720 --> 01:33:44,800
I go to Benaras every week
for my Social work.

1453
01:33:46,760 --> 01:33:50,510
When I'm here,
I miss Badriji a lot.

1454
01:33:51,930 --> 01:33:54,590
Feelings are so ungrateful.

1455
01:33:55,430 --> 01:33:57,970
They hurt the very heart
they exist in.

1456
01:34:08,870 --> 01:34:10,430
Can I say something?

1457
01:34:10,880 --> 01:34:13,180
I've never felt so weak...

1458
01:34:16,430 --> 01:34:18,300
So weak in the knees.

1459
01:34:20,010 --> 01:34:22,990
I could have handled the mind.

1460
01:34:24,340 --> 01:34:26,910
But, how do I control my heart?

1461
01:34:28,160 --> 01:34:29,560
It aches for you.

1462
01:34:29,760 --> 01:34:32,440
Bholaji, we're friends.

1463
01:34:32,630 --> 01:34:34,030
That's it.

1464
01:34:36,200 --> 01:34:38,650
I'll get you something to eat.

1465
01:34:39,620 --> 01:34:41,310
Please tell the maid.

1466
01:34:43,220 --> 01:34:44,930
There's no one at home.

1467
01:34:49,220 --> 01:34:50,290
Murari...

1468
01:34:50,510 --> 01:34:51,760
What are you doing?

1469
01:34:51,880 --> 01:34:52,550
Go!

1470
01:34:52,630 --> 01:34:55,010
- She's getting food.
- That's for me.

1471
01:34:55,130 --> 01:34:56,180
Not for you.

1472
01:34:56,430 --> 01:34:57,440
Right.

1473
01:34:58,620 --> 01:34:59,800
Idoit.

1474
01:35:16,800 --> 01:35:17,880
Hello.

1475
01:35:22,960 --> 01:35:24,630
How is it okay, Bholaji?

1476
01:35:24,840 --> 01:35:27,690
Everything is good
when you're with me.

1477
01:35:28,260 --> 01:35:31,210
Please don't talk like that.

1478
01:35:35,300 --> 01:35:36,500
What happened?

1479
01:35:36,760 --> 01:35:38,280
Did I disturb you?

1480
01:35:38,510 --> 01:35:41,050
Don't bother... carry on.

1481
01:35:44,340 --> 01:35:46,590
Why did you steal my husband.

1482
01:35:48,220 --> 01:35:49,890
Why?

1483
01:35:57,440 --> 01:36:01,260
I will take care of her.
- Go

1484
01:36:01,810 --> 01:36:04,050
Bholaji, are you okay?

1485
01:36:12,760 --> 01:36:14,260
Murari, what did you do?

1486
01:36:14,420 --> 01:36:15,460
I'm taking her.

1487
01:36:15,590 --> 01:36:16,590
Sorry.

1488
01:36:16,760 --> 01:36:17,810
Like this?

1489
01:36:19,760 --> 01:36:20,810
Oh man?

1490
01:36:22,340 --> 01:36:23,540
Oh God...

1491
01:36:25,170 --> 01:36:27,130
Badriji had two wives?

1492
01:36:30,360 --> 01:36:32,380
What're you saying, Bholaji?

1493
01:36:32,710 --> 01:36:36,800
He must have promised her
His wealth but you got it.

1494
01:36:37,410 --> 01:36:39,010
She must have gone crazy.

1495
01:36:39,820 --> 01:36:41,760
My husband
can't do something like this.

1496
01:36:41,840 --> 01:36:43,430
I thought she your wife?

1497
01:36:45,110 --> 01:36:46,930
I told you I'm unmarried.

1498
01:36:47,230 --> 01:36:48,630
Didn't I?

1499
01:36:51,240 --> 01:36:53,150
This is not possible.

1500
01:36:56,990 --> 01:37:00,010
Bholaji, you must be
in a lot of pain...

1501
01:37:00,090 --> 01:37:01,090
Yes.

1502
01:37:02,710 --> 01:37:05,850
You risked your life for me.

1503
01:37:07,880 --> 01:37:11,590
If I could give up my life
for the one I love...

1504
01:37:11,760 --> 01:37:13,580
it would be an honour.

1505
01:37:16,260 --> 01:37:18,490
Bholaji, please don't talk like this.

1506
01:37:18,760 --> 01:37:21,710
You know I am Badriji's widow.

1507
01:37:22,510 --> 01:37:24,420
Badriji was your past.

1508
01:37:24,780 --> 01:37:27,800
I am your present
and could be your future.

1509
01:37:27,960 --> 01:37:30,010
Why can't you be mine?

1510
01:37:31,010 --> 01:37:33,960
I swear I will keep you very happy.

1511
01:37:34,670 --> 01:37:37,650
Badriji gave you only one part of him.

1512
01:37:37,960 --> 01:37:41,430
I will remain faithful to you forever.

1513
01:37:41,740 --> 01:37:42,980
The same thing again and again!

1514
01:37:43,210 --> 01:37:46,870
I beg you...
please don't curse this friendship.

1515
01:37:47,260 --> 01:37:48,260
That's it.

1516
01:37:48,410 --> 01:37:49,840
I won't listen to you anymore.

1517
01:37:50,010 --> 01:37:54,130
I'm tired of living
this compromi sed life.

1518
01:37:54,460 --> 01:37:56,300
I love you.

1519
01:37:57,360 --> 01:37:59,780
If I stop today,
I'll regret forever.

1520
01:37:59,910 --> 01:38:01,450
And I don't want to regret.

1521
01:38:02,280 --> 01:38:07,240
I've been waiting for the perfect girl.
So I can give this ring to her.

1522
01:38:08,460 --> 01:38:09,590
This?

1523
01:38:12,460 --> 01:38:13,960
This ring belong to my mother.

1524
01:38:14,740 --> 01:38:16,800
She wanted her
daughter-in-law to have it.

1525
01:38:16,980 --> 01:38:18,860
I think of you as my soulmate.

1526
01:38:19,420 --> 01:38:22,460
Why can't you think
of me the same way?

1527
01:38:22,700 --> 01:38:23,776
- Let me put this in your finger.
- Bholaji.

1528
01:38:23,800 --> 01:38:24,300
Please wear it.

1529
01:38:24,380 --> 01:38:25,686
- Bholaji, what are you doing?
- Please don't stop me.

1530
01:38:25,710 --> 01:38:27,106
- Bholaji, what are you doing?
- Please don't stop me.

1531
01:38:27,130 --> 01:38:29,010
I beg you.
I'll die.

1532
01:38:29,090 --> 01:38:30,960
Bholaji, please don't
ever say that.

1533
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:32,730
May you have a long life.

1534
01:38:34,710 --> 01:38:38,860
You can wish for my long life
but why can't you be a part of it?

1535
01:38:39,170 --> 01:38:40,170
Bholaji.

1536
01:38:40,510 --> 01:38:41,540
Payalji.

1537
01:38:46,310 --> 01:38:48,020
What have you done?

1538
01:38:49,130 --> 01:38:51,460
Bholaji, this is wrong.
It's a sin.

1539
01:38:51,670 --> 01:38:55,420
There's nothing sinful about it.

1540
01:38:55,590 --> 01:39:01,240
If my love is a sin,
I'm willing to commit one.

1541
01:39:01,660 --> 01:39:03,170
But we can't, Bholaji.

1542
01:39:03,300 --> 01:39:05,300
- Please.
- Why are you holding back?

1543
01:39:05,380 --> 01:39:07,460
I beg you.

1544
01:39:07,840 --> 01:39:09,800
Look how happy Badriji looks.

1545
01:39:09,880 --> 01:39:10,710
His soul will finally be...

1546
01:39:10,790 --> 01:39:13,106
at peace knowing that you are
getting your fair share of happiness.

1547
01:39:13,130 --> 01:39:16,420
- Bholaji, it's a sin.
- Just once...

1548
01:39:16,590 --> 01:39:19,050
I'm 35... yet, celibate.

1549
01:39:19,170 --> 01:39:20,960
Please, Payalji.

1550
01:39:21,460 --> 01:39:22,460
Enough, Bholaji.

1551
01:39:22,510 --> 01:39:24,960
We won't go the whole way.
Maybe just half way?

1552
01:39:25,760 --> 01:39:26,930
Bholaji, don't be stubborn.

1553
01:39:27,010 --> 01:39:28,800
It's a small small request.

1554
01:39:28,880 --> 01:39:30,140
Bholaji, this is wrong.

1555
01:39:30,220 --> 01:39:31,760
But it feels so right.

1556
01:39:31,980 --> 01:39:32,630
Bholaji.

1557
01:39:32,710 --> 01:39:34,620
Oh... we've automatically
fallen on the bed!

1558
01:39:34,700 --> 01:39:36,300
Even god wants this to happen.

1559
01:39:36,420 --> 01:39:39,510
- Bholaji, please stop.
- Okay... just a peek then?

1560
01:39:39,680 --> 01:39:43,840
I'll manage with gazing at you.

1561
01:39:45,130 --> 01:39:46,840
- Bholaji.
- Payalji.

1562
01:39:52,140 --> 01:39:54,520
What happened wasn't right.

1563
01:39:55,510 --> 01:39:57,270
I'm a widow.

1564
01:39:59,210 --> 01:40:00,850
And now...

1565
01:40:05,260 --> 01:40:10,210
Promise me that you'll marry me.

1566
01:40:12,070 --> 01:40:16,880
That you'll never leave me.

1567
01:41:16,880 --> 01:41:18,890
Wow.

1568
01:41:19,380 --> 01:41:24,160
The prodigal lover has returned!

1569
01:41:27,300 --> 01:41:30,420
Boss, you look very tired.

1570
01:41:30,800 --> 01:41:32,140
Is everything okay?

1571
01:41:33,880 --> 01:41:35,900
Payalji wants to marry me.

1572
01:41:36,340 --> 01:41:38,380
Congratulations, brother!

1573
01:41:38,550 --> 01:41:41,300
- Isn't that what you wanted?
- No!

1574
01:41:41,670 --> 01:41:43,176
Now I don't want to get married to her.

1575
01:41:43,200 --> 01:41:45,760
- What do you mean?
- I mean... I've fallen for her.

1576
01:41:46,590 --> 01:41:49,170
And I can't marry
the one I love.

1577
01:41:49,550 --> 01:41:51,120
Everything will get ruined.

1578
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:56,920
Let's forget about her
and find someone else.

1579
01:41:57,170 --> 01:41:58,310
What?

1580
01:41:58,450 --> 01:41:59,920
Where's the time?

1581
01:42:00,050 --> 01:42:02,300
Look, you're getting very confused.

1582
01:42:02,380 --> 01:42:05,160
We don't have time.

1583
01:42:05,240 --> 01:42:07,550
If Chanda wakes up,
she'll shoot us.

1584
01:42:07,920 --> 01:42:10,090
- How can you fall in love?
- I couldn't help it!

1585
01:42:10,300 --> 01:42:11,760
You're my Boss.

1586
01:42:11,950 --> 01:42:13,080
Don't lose confidence.

1587
01:42:13,160 --> 01:42:15,220
Just get married,
get the cash and get out of here.

1588
01:42:15,350 --> 01:42:17,150
We don't have any other choice.

1589
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:20,050
What the hell!

1590
01:42:21,630 --> 01:42:23,260
The milk split.

1591
01:42:33,210 --> 01:42:34,280
Murari..

1592
01:42:35,970 --> 01:42:37,410
Lets get you a suit.

1593
01:42:38,050 --> 01:42:39,340
Let's get to work.

1594
01:43:04,300 --> 01:43:06,090
- Everyone please sit.
- I'll be right back.

1595
01:43:07,390 --> 01:43:08,550
Please move.

1596
01:43:09,840 --> 01:43:11,380
How could he marry her?

1597
01:43:12,770 --> 01:43:13,770
Hello.

1598
01:43:14,380 --> 01:43:16,510
Have you seen yourself?

1599
01:43:20,020 --> 01:43:21,310
Be alert... okay?

1600
01:43:27,290 --> 01:43:31,490
Murari, where has
the groom disappeared?

1601
01:43:31,660 --> 01:43:33,580
He must've gone to the bathroom.

1602
01:43:33,710 --> 01:43:35,220
The pressure increases in such times.

1603
01:43:35,340 --> 01:43:36,620
Are you done?

1604
01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:37,510
No.

1605
01:43:37,720 --> 01:43:40,520
Then why are you pressurizing me?
Keep going.

1606
01:43:52,800 --> 01:43:54,380
When will we catch Bhola?

1607
01:43:54,460 --> 01:43:56,130
What are you waiting for?

1608
01:43:56,260 --> 01:44:01,510
I was waiting for his harem.
They're all here.

1609
01:44:01,920 --> 01:44:03,160
Get him.

1610
01:44:03,550 --> 01:44:05,560
Let's play our trump card.

1611
01:44:05,780 --> 01:44:06,810
Fantastic!

1612
01:44:26,260 --> 01:44:34,120
I swear if I didn't love you,
I would've married you, Payalji.

1613
01:44:35,300 --> 01:44:37,010
But, what to do?

1614
01:44:38,050 --> 01:44:39,610
I've fallen in love.

1615
01:45:06,170 --> 01:45:09,130
Murari, your Fraud groom has vanished.

1616
01:45:09,700 --> 01:45:11,340
Why are you screaming?

1617
01:45:11,510 --> 01:45:12,840
Can't you be quiet for some time?

1618
01:45:13,550 --> 01:45:14,590
What happened?

1619
01:45:14,710 --> 01:45:15,930
Nothing.
He's coming.

1620
01:45:16,010 --> 01:45:17,310
Bholaji's coming.

1621
01:45:17,760 --> 01:45:18,790
Don't lie.

1622
01:45:21,380 --> 01:45:23,140
You want the truth?

1623
01:45:23,920 --> 01:45:28,010
Payalji, the truth is that Bholaji
has run away.

1624
01:45:30,510 --> 01:45:31,920
You're lying.

1625
01:45:34,260 --> 01:45:35,840
This is Great...

1626
01:45:37,010 --> 01:45:40,210
you want to know the truth
but you don't want to believe it.

1627
01:45:40,710 --> 01:45:41,950
Super.

1628
01:45:43,130 --> 01:45:44,900
Go and catch him.

1629
01:45:50,700 --> 01:45:52,020
I'm on it sir!

1630
01:45:52,100 --> 01:45:53,240
Come on. Hurry up!

1631
01:46:42,010 --> 01:46:44,080
Wipe your tears, Payalji.

1632
01:46:45,260 --> 01:46:46,550
Look who's here.

1633
01:47:15,260 --> 01:47:17,190
I looked for you everywhere.

1634
01:47:17,910 --> 01:47:21,140
We couldn't find you.

1635
01:47:23,590 --> 01:47:25,470
Where did you go...

1636
01:47:27,920 --> 01:47:29,510
leaving me alone?

1637
01:47:31,010 --> 01:47:34,490
I had gone to gather
the entourage of your husbands.

1638
01:47:43,010 --> 01:47:44,400
I've found about half a dozen.

1639
01:47:44,590 --> 01:47:47,090
Are these all?
Or are these all I found?

1640
01:47:58,050 --> 01:48:01,510
It would have been better
if you had dead.

1641
01:48:02,590 --> 01:48:04,430
How could I?

1642
01:48:05,360 --> 01:48:09,230
- The accident was fake.
- Just like you, payalji

1643
01:48:11,010 --> 01:48:13,130
there are many cases against you.

1644
01:48:13,410 --> 01:48:16,000
Six marriages.
Six robberies...

1645
01:48:16,210 --> 01:48:17,856
The cops have been looking for you
since eight months.

1646
01:48:17,880 --> 01:48:19,520
We've got you with
a lot of difficulty.

1647
01:48:20,700 --> 01:48:22,030
You have six husbands!!??

1648
01:48:22,280 --> 01:48:24,740
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

1649
01:48:24,960 --> 01:48:28,240
Bholaji's here.

1650
01:48:28,510 --> 01:48:30,460
Why are you getting so angry?

1651
01:48:30,630 --> 01:48:33,960
Your 12 wives are here
to welcome you, too.

1652
01:48:34,390 --> 01:48:35,710
Please meet them.

1653
01:48:41,050 --> 01:48:42,180
12 wives?

1654
01:48:42,260 --> 01:48:45,240
Yes, Payalji.
He's one from your breed.

1655
01:48:47,800 --> 01:48:49,340
What are you laughing at?

1656
01:48:49,510 --> 01:48:52,050
Aren't you both partners...
peas of the same pod?

1657
01:48:52,130 --> 01:48:54,930
Not at all!
My name is M.L. Chaurasia.

1658
01:48:55,010 --> 01:48:58,760
I'm a private detective...
hired by your husband to spy on you.

1659
01:48:58,880 --> 01:48:59,710
Get it?

1660
01:48:59,800 --> 01:49:03,090
I knew you were tricking me.

1661
01:49:03,170 --> 01:49:07,670
I doubted you the very moment, I saw
this cop at the rive bank.

1662
01:49:07,860 --> 01:49:09,260
What have I done wrong?

1663
01:49:09,340 --> 01:49:11,760
- Why did you stab me in my back?
- I was on duty.

1664
01:49:11,920 --> 01:49:16,090
I was following you on the train
when I met him.

1665
01:49:16,170 --> 01:49:18,720
I realized that
I had to catch both of you together.

1666
01:49:18,800 --> 01:49:21,680
That's why I forged
a meeting in the hospital.

1667
01:49:21,760 --> 01:49:24,380
- Arrest him.
- How dare you.

1668
01:49:24,460 --> 01:49:26,890
Sit.
I'm not done talking.

1669
01:49:27,550 --> 01:49:29,430
And you...
have you ever heard of commitment?

1670
01:49:29,510 --> 01:49:31,590
Really!! look whose talking!

1671
01:49:31,670 --> 01:49:33,436
Look at your name...
Rana Bhola Pratap Singh...

1672
01:49:33,460 --> 01:49:34,930
as if your the heir to a kingdom.

1673
01:49:35,010 --> 01:49:36,840
- Bloody fraud!
- You are no different.

1674
01:49:36,920 --> 01:49:39,880
I thought you are a saint. But,
you turned out to be exactly like me.

1675
01:49:39,960 --> 01:49:42,010
What are you sulking for?
Why did you come back?

1676
01:49:42,090 --> 01:49:44,129
- Because a mad dog bit me!
- Wow...

1677
01:49:44,130 --> 01:49:45,840
even dogs don't have
standards nowadays.

1678
01:49:45,920 --> 01:49:48,680
How heartless of you to play
with my feelings and emotions.

1679
01:49:48,760 --> 01:49:50,250
And what you did with me?

1680
01:49:50,340 --> 01:49:53,260
That was love...
which you will never feel.

1681
01:49:53,340 --> 01:49:54,720
Do you have copyright on 'love'?

1682
01:49:54,800 --> 01:49:58,670
I am in love, too...
with you!

1683
01:50:04,710 --> 01:50:05,880
Come on, arrest them.

1684
01:50:05,960 --> 01:50:09,760
Murari, it was such
an enjoyable lover's tiff.

1685
01:50:09,840 --> 01:50:12,550
Such fun!
You stopped it.

1686
01:50:13,260 --> 01:50:14,260
Come on, Bhola.

1687
01:50:16,170 --> 01:50:17,710
Murari, sit.

1688
01:50:21,340 --> 01:50:26,040
I will kill the girl if anyone
tries to stop me.

1689
01:50:28,570 --> 01:50:31,150
Bhola, why don't you kill her...
for real.

1690
01:50:31,380 --> 01:50:34,620
You would've served six years of time,
now you will serve a life sentence.

1691
01:50:34,790 --> 01:50:37,590
I'll count to 3
and you kill her.

1692
01:50:37,710 --> 01:50:38,730
1...

1693
01:50:39,750 --> 01:50:40,790
2...

1694
01:50:42,050 --> 01:50:42,840
3.

1695
01:50:42,920 --> 01:50:44,670
Why don't I kill you instead?

1696
01:50:45,090 --> 01:50:46,090
Me?

1697
01:50:47,010 --> 01:50:49,010
Will you kill your friend?

1698
01:50:49,090 --> 01:50:50,170
Friend?

1699
01:50:50,380 --> 01:50:51,470
You chameleon.

1700
01:50:51,550 --> 01:50:52,630
Bhola, listen to me.

1701
01:50:52,710 --> 01:50:53,880
Payal...

1702
01:50:54,130 --> 01:50:56,010
Payal, take the bag and run.

1703
01:50:56,170 --> 01:50:57,630
What are you doing, Bhola?

1704
01:50:57,800 --> 01:50:59,260
Are you mad?

1705
01:50:59,500 --> 01:51:00,590
Run, Payal.

1706
01:51:01,260 --> 01:51:04,260
If our love is real,
we'll meet again.

1707
01:51:04,760 --> 01:51:05,550
Go.

1708
01:51:05,670 --> 01:51:07,710
- Bhola, she'll run away.
- Run!

1709
01:51:08,240 --> 01:51:09,510
Murari, stop.

1710
01:51:09,590 --> 01:51:10,800
She's gone.

1711
01:51:10,880 --> 01:51:14,500
She isn't coming back.
Bhola, listen to me.

1712
01:51:21,350 --> 01:51:23,460
Don't think you've won.

1713
01:51:23,590 --> 01:51:26,060
Put down the gun.

1714
01:51:27,960 --> 01:51:30,300
You've gone mad.
Catch him!

1715
01:51:30,380 --> 01:51:32,110

Rana Bholapratap Singh,
you have been granted bail.

1730
01:53:05,350 --> 01:53:10,590
I'm wondering why a crook
like you would bail me out.

1731
01:53:11,130 --> 01:53:14,940
Catching you was my job.

1732
01:53:15,520 --> 01:53:18,050
Bailing you out is my need.

1733
01:53:18,360 --> 01:53:20,510
There's no money
in being a detective.

1734
01:53:20,660 --> 01:53:23,630
Badriji promised me
a hefty amount.

1735
01:53:23,790 --> 01:53:25,176
But after tax deduction
I barely got anything in hand.

1736
01:53:25,200 --> 01:53:27,520
Have you got me out
to pay your taxes?

1737
01:53:27,780 --> 01:53:29,810
She ran away with all the money I had.

1738
01:53:30,270 --> 01:53:32,020
She did.
But, Payalji...

1739
01:53:32,100 --> 01:53:33,800
Don't utter her name!

1740
01:53:34,960 --> 01:53:36,396
I've been rotting
here since seven days...

1741
01:53:36,420 --> 01:53:38,330
and she didn't
even come to meet me once.

1742
01:53:38,840 --> 01:53:41,490
My biggest mistake
was falling in love with her.

1743
01:53:42,090 --> 01:53:44,470
If I see her, I'll strangle her.

1744
01:53:49,210 --> 01:53:50,340
Do it.

1745
01:53:51,090 --> 01:53:54,330
She's the one who paid for your bail.

1746
01:53:56,310 --> 01:53:59,420
She paid me
a commission to get you out.

1747
01:54:01,350 --> 01:54:06,260
Boss, our film has ended.

1748
01:54:25,800 --> 01:54:28,690
Let's get married.

1749
01:54:31,880 --> 01:54:34,510
Our marriage can wait.

1750
01:54:35,300 --> 01:54:37,930
There's a Rich girl in Nasik city.

1751
01:54:38,170 --> 01:54:40,260
The husband keeps unwell.
The wife's young.

1752
01:54:40,340 --> 01:54:42,420
Up for marriage?

1753
01:54:47,970 --> 01:54:49,920
What are you thinking, Bhola?

1754
01:54:51,880 --> 01:54:53,840
I'm thinking of taking
a picture of you.

1755
01:54:54,300 --> 01:54:56,400
You're looking gorgeous.

1756
01:55:02,640 --> 01:55:03,180
Nice.

1757
01:55:03,340 --> 01:55:04,340
Go there.

1758
01:55:06,550 --> 01:55:08,300
A little further back.

1759
01:55:10,130 --> 01:55:11,760
A little further back.

1760
01:55:12,240 --> 01:55:13,710
And to your right...
near that wall.

1761
01:55:13,920 --> 01:55:14,970
Turn.

1762
01:55:15,350 --> 01:55:19,500
Look there.
Yes... face the wall.

1763
01:55:20,200 --> 01:55:22,460
And forget about me.

1764
01:55:32,760 --> 01:55:39,850
Murari, I wonder why my parents
gave me such a naive name... Bhola.

1765
