1
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:39,332
He is a coward!

2
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:29,666
Get away! Get back

3
00:04:29,808 --> 00:04:30,604
What happened?

4
00:04:30,709 --> 00:04:31,641
Miners of terminal no. 4
have been trapped.

5
00:04:31,676 --> 00:04:33,666
And our Raghunath too.

6
00:07:27,248 --> 00:07:33,208
Victory to Vijay!

7
00:08:00,807 --> 00:08:03,743
Yes, I am a coward.

8
00:08:18,188 --> 00:08:18,916
Good morning Sir

9
00:08:24,058 --> 00:08:26,118
Arrange to send the luggage
in the other vehicle

10
00:08:45,009 --> 00:08:46,841
Driver, close the windows
and put on the air conditioner.

11
00:08:47,977 --> 00:08:50,138
I feel uncomfortable
passing through this area.

12
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:51,478
The atmosphere here
is very bad.

13
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:54,348
Because small pieces of
coal are present in the air.

14
00:08:55,784 --> 00:08:57,751
Whenever I see this place
and the people here...

15
00:08:58,787 --> 00:09:03,881
I feel like either selling
these mines or closing it down.

16
00:09:05,425 --> 00:09:07,415
But what can I do?
After all, it's business.

17
00:09:08,694 --> 00:09:11,923
Has anyone been selected for the
vacant post of the engineer?

18
00:09:11,962 --> 00:09:12,929
Yes, Sir. I have sent
the appointment letter

19
00:09:12,963 --> 00:09:14,955
His name is Ravi Malhotra.
He is likely to come tomorrow.

20
00:09:25,976 --> 00:09:28,739
" Life is a journey..."

21
00:09:28,778 --> 00:09:32,769
"Should we halt...
nothing will remain"

22
00:09:41,486 --> 00:09:48,618
"Should we dally somewhere,
nothing will remain"

23
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:19,275
"O traveller..."

24
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:23,677
" My hand and these paths..."

25
00:10:26,488 --> 00:10:28,479
" Do not ever leave them"

26
00:10:28,524 --> 00:10:30,286
" Return to them"

27
00:10:46,037 --> 00:10:53,306
" Whether it' s beauty...
or the voices of love..."

28
00:10:53,343 --> 00:11:01,078
" Birds do not give up
flying for them"

29
00:11:01,851 --> 00:11:05,216
"The paths that go up and down..."

30
00:11:05,252 --> 00:11:10,052
"carry footprints
of travellers..."

31
00:11:10,457 --> 00:11:13,425
"we must not stop and
put an end to it"

32
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:07,364
" Be not so heartless...
don't go away, love"

33
00:12:19,143 --> 00:12:25,012
" Take me along, too,
whenever you go out, my love"

34
00:12:29,051 --> 00:12:35,888
" Why cling to the shadows
of a traveller"

35
00:12:35,924 --> 00:12:40,019
"These travellers stay
but for a few moments..."

36
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:44,792
" Why cling to them?"

37
00:13:31,135 --> 00:13:32,761
May I come in?
- Yes

38
00:13:35,003 --> 00:13:38,403
I am Ravi Malhotra.
This is my appointment letter.

39
00:13:40,108 --> 00:13:44,509
You will be working under me.
I' m the Chief Engineer here.

40
00:13:44,678 --> 00:13:48,272
I read the name plate, sir.

41
00:13:48,347 --> 00:13:49,314
OK.

42
00:13:49,349 --> 00:13:50,906
You may join from tomorrow.
- Thank you very much.

43
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:52,644
Just a minute.

44
00:13:53,685 --> 00:13:56,915
We've a meeting with the boss
regarding a project we' re starting.

45
00:13:56,954 --> 00:13:58,923
This is the blueprint.

46
00:13:58,957 --> 00:14:02,584
Before coming here,
study it in detail.

47
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:04,555
Right Sir.
Thank You.

48
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:10,389
There's a problem.
- What?

49
00:14:11,099 --> 00:14:12,998
It's not possible for us to
continue work in the tunnel No.4

50
00:14:13,033 --> 00:14:15,195
Because the nearby mine
is filled with water.

51
00:14:15,369 --> 00:14:18,201
And if we go ahead with it,
water may enter the tunnel.

52
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:24,775
You are well aware, that nearly
400 workers work in it.

53
00:14:25,876 --> 00:14:29,176
What loss will we incur if
Tunnel 4's work is stopped?

54
00:14:29,513 --> 00:14:33,141
A minimum of Rupees 4 million
worth of coal will be lost.

55
00:14:33,985 --> 00:14:36,179
Then your mathematics
is very weak.

56
00:14:36,219 --> 00:14:40,483
You even don't know that 4
million is more than 4 hundred.

57
00:14:40,521 --> 00:14:44,855
Don't discuss this
matter with anyone.

58
00:14:46,126 --> 00:14:47,560
Try to extract as much
coal as possible.

59
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:49,993
I' ll handle it
if anything goes wrong.

60
00:14:52,198 --> 00:14:53,495
Excuse me.
May I come in Sir?

61
00:14:53,798 --> 00:14:54,766
Come in

62
00:14:56,267 --> 00:14:58,360
This is our new Engineer.
- How do you do sir?

63
00:15:03,439 --> 00:15:06,033
I' m sorry I am late
by two minutes.

64
00:15:06,075 --> 00:15:08,804
It took time to search this place
since l' m a newcomer.

65
00:15:10,612 --> 00:15:14,844
You are a newcomer!
So Mr. Saxena, what were you saying?

66
00:15:14,883 --> 00:15:18,942
I was saying that we' ll go up to
this place in this project.

67
00:15:19,219 --> 00:15:20,482
Up to here?
- Yes.

68
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:26,556
That's why, mines that go this
way are filled with water.

69
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:29,287
There's coal between these two.

70
00:15:29,327 --> 00:15:31,955
To remove it, we' ll have
to dig a tunnel.

71
00:15:33,563 --> 00:15:33,858
Excuse me,

72
00:15:35,632 --> 00:15:40,033
I'd like to say something on this,
with your permission.

73
00:15:42,102 --> 00:15:46,129
You just mentioned that you want
to dig the tunnel further, sir.

74
00:15:46,174 --> 00:15:47,696
But we should be careful
about one thing.

75
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:51,506
The adjacent mine is
filled with water.

76
00:15:51,544 --> 00:15:57,504
The more we dig, the gap
between them will decrease.

77
00:16:01,053 --> 00:16:03,077
And if this gap decreases...

78
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,145
it' ll break the wall
and enter the tunnel.

79
00:16:08,858 --> 00:16:12,759
If this occurs, then every
worker's life will be endangered.

80
00:16:12,961 --> 00:16:17,658
You may be qualified, but your
practical experience is zero.

81
00:16:19,733 --> 00:16:22,224
Mr. Saxena is a Chief Engineer
for the past 1 5 years

82
00:16:22,269 --> 00:16:22,928
If there had to be any danger,
would he have not informed us?

83
00:16:26,438 --> 00:16:28,963
No Sir, with due respect to
Mr.Saxena, I didn't mean that.

84
00:16:29,441 --> 00:16:31,431
If we have to look at
these small matters

85
00:16:31,475 --> 00:16:32,772
then we' ll have to close
down all the mines.

86
00:16:33,309 --> 00:16:35,870
Yes, such accidents always
occur in the mines.

87
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:38,280
Sir, four days ago a man
got stuck in the tunnel.

88
00:16:38,382 --> 00:16:43,010
A worker named Vijay
rescued him.

89
00:16:43,051 --> 00:16:46,680
He had earlier too saved
a couple of lives.

90
00:16:46,887 --> 00:16:50,482
He's a brave man;
he should be rewarded

91
00:16:51,859 --> 00:16:55,349
Sometimes you speak like an
experienced man.

92
00:16:56,662 --> 00:17:00,462
A man who can dare to risk his
life to save someone...

93
00:17:01,699 --> 00:17:04,258
can be dangerous to us
in the near future.

94
00:17:04,701 --> 00:17:07,295
And you want to reward
such people.

95
00:17:07,771 --> 00:17:12,866
Only those people are useful to us
who can slog to death.

96
00:17:17,613 --> 00:17:19,443
What's that worker's
name you said?

97
00:17:22,182 --> 00:17:26,743
This man doesn't seem of
any use to us.

98
00:17:27,788 --> 00:17:28,878
I don't mind even if my
hotel doesn't run.

99
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,046
But I will stop
giving credit.

100
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:36,854
Uncle, please send me tea.

101
00:17:36,894 --> 00:17:40,293
Give tea to Mr. Vijay

102
00:17:44,266 --> 00:17:47,428
Brother, this is no ordinary ring.
It's a magical ring.

103
00:17:47,468 --> 00:17:49,594
If you wear this ring,

104
00:17:49,636 --> 00:17:50,603
... every impossible work
will be successful.

105
00:17:50,637 --> 00:17:52,935
If your son has run away,
or you are jobless...

106
00:17:52,973 --> 00:17:56,034
or you've had a run of bad luck,
just try it once and see.

107
00:17:56,077 --> 00:17:58,873
Your boss will talk to you
with respect.

108
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:02,107
If you are childless,
wear this ring.

109
00:18:02,147 --> 00:18:05,140
And if those who get more
children, wear this...

110
00:18:05,184 --> 00:18:08,309
...and you won't get any
more children.

111
00:18:08,351 --> 00:18:13,653
This magical ring has changed
the life of many people.

112
00:18:18,359 --> 00:18:19,951
The cost of this ring is
just one rupee.

113
00:18:19,994 --> 00:18:23,020
One rupee is not worth the
beetle you chew and spit.

114
00:18:23,063 --> 00:18:26,997
Those who buy combs, bangles...

115
00:18:27,032 --> 00:18:29,364
you will get this ring for
just for fifty paise.

116
00:18:35,241 --> 00:18:36,763
How are you Channo?

117
00:18:36,841 --> 00:18:38,968
O.K. I' m passing my days.

118
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:41,136
You tell me; where were
you all these days?

119
00:18:41,178 --> 00:18:46,911
Uncle, give me some tea too.
And first give me water.

120
00:18:47,982 --> 00:18:50,678
I have sold many rings
till now.

121
00:18:50,718 --> 00:18:51,582
But you have never purchased
a single ring from me.

122
00:18:51,619 --> 00:18:54,144
Buy one and see. All your
wishes will be fulfilled.

123
00:18:55,588 --> 00:18:57,988
What will a man who has no ambition
in life, do with this ring?

124
00:18:59,592 --> 00:19:01,150
If there are a more
people like you...

125
00:19:01,194 --> 00:19:02,354
...I' ll have to shut down
my business!

126
00:19:02,795 --> 00:19:07,287
Whom are you fooling?
You earn a lot everyday.

127
00:19:07,331 --> 00:19:09,890
She goes to the colony...

128
00:19:09,933 --> 00:19:12,961
and sells combs, bangles,
at double the rate.

129
00:19:14,704 --> 00:19:18,538
Women of this colony are fond of
bangles. They buy them in lots.

130
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:24,640
Uncle, the wives of men
who die working in mines...

131
00:19:26,214 --> 00:19:29,704
...buy bangles not to wear them,
but as sign of impending widowhood.

132
00:19:29,815 --> 00:19:30,680
You are absolutely right.

133
00:19:34,385 --> 00:19:38,015
" Life is short"

134
00:19:39,089 --> 00:19:42,217
" Let not be brow be
creased with worry"

135
00:19:43,392 --> 00:19:46,418
"There are people good at heart;
and there are those evil"

136
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:55,362
" Befriend everyone,
we must"

137
00:20:00,306 --> 00:20:07,006
" Everyone is God's man"

138
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:26,520
Sat Sri Akal!

139
00:20:27,428 --> 00:20:30,589
You' re sitting here!
Didn't you go to work?

140
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:33,658
Sit down.
Send a cup of tea for Jagga, Uncle.

141
00:20:38,336 --> 00:20:41,794
Well, lady? Why' re you so quiet?
- I've already finished talking.

142
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:43,171
First tell me, have you brought
the things I had asked for?

143
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:45,569
Have I ever forgotten that?

144
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:49,701
Give her that packet
wrapped in the newspaper.

145
00:20:49,746 --> 00:20:52,339
I've brought everything!
The bangles, powder...

146
00:20:56,783 --> 00:20:58,512
Sat sar Akal!

147
00:21:02,489 --> 00:21:04,889
It's pointless gambling with Rana.

148
00:21:04,926 --> 00:21:07,858
He pulls a trick every time.
- He's a very lucky man.

149
00:21:09,161 --> 00:21:10,889
Is it your luck, or have you
played any tricks?

150
00:21:10,929 --> 00:21:15,457
I hope you are not cheating?
- No. It's just my luck.

151
00:21:16,766 --> 00:21:18,325
In Punjab, luck means the waist!

152
00:21:18,368 --> 00:21:19,595
Luck, Jagga.
As igood fortune!

153
00:21:21,971 --> 00:21:24,735
Give me some luck, so
I can make some money too!

154
00:21:27,108 --> 00:21:28,472
Make me some fritters!

155
00:21:31,145 --> 00:21:35,944
Well? Why don't you eat anything?

156
00:21:36,515 --> 00:21:38,506
You must see a doctor.

157
00:21:38,784 --> 00:21:41,810
That reminds me.
I met a lady doctor at the station.

158
00:21:41,853 --> 00:21:43,513
She's come in place of
the old doctor.

159
00:21:43,554 --> 00:21:47,250
I gave her a ride in my truck.

160
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:48,587
She was good to look at.

161
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:51,617
But whether she's a good doctor,
God alone knows.

162
00:21:52,295 --> 00:21:53,954
Doctor...

163
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:59,764
These are the keys
to the cupboard.

164
00:22:01,169 --> 00:22:03,658
Actually there's no
need to lock them.

165
00:22:03,703 --> 00:22:06,764
The bottles are either empty
or there is little medicine.

166
00:22:09,475 --> 00:22:10,407
Here are the case histories.

167
00:22:11,544 --> 00:22:13,476
You' ll find the names of the patients
maintained in alphabetical order.

168
00:22:14,546 --> 00:22:16,639
If you have any queries,
you can ask Gangadhar.

169
00:22:17,613 --> 00:22:20,013
Yes Sir?
- She's the new doctor.

170
00:22:22,317 --> 00:22:29,654
He's the watchman, the compounder,
the nurse, the cook, all in one.

171
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:32,090
We have just one man
from the management.

172
00:22:34,595 --> 00:22:37,427
How long have you been here?

173
00:22:38,565 --> 00:22:44,935
Me? I've been here for very long.
Very, very long... 3 months.

174
00:22:47,038 --> 00:22:49,131
You call 3 months
a very long period!

175
00:22:51,207 --> 00:22:53,698
Like our other colleagues in
the medical profession...

176
00:22:53,743 --> 00:22:56,610
... perhaps you are scared to
practice in remote places.

177
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:02,547
But our duty is to go to places
where there are no doctors...

178
00:23:02,583 --> 00:23:06,848
and although there might
be difficulties...

179
00:23:06,886 --> 00:23:13,689
It was exactly with this intention
that I had come here, Dr. Sudha Sen.

180
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:16,793
I wanted to restore good health
to those sick.

181
00:23:16,828 --> 00:23:20,353
I wanted to treat the patients.
But how could l?

182
00:23:22,599 --> 00:23:25,066
We have corpses brought into
this hospital. Not patients.

183
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:27,125
Corpses, which are not
completely dead either.

184
00:23:28,871 --> 00:23:31,805
We have no medicines, no equipments
and no facilities.

185
00:23:32,707 --> 00:23:36,369
I' m sorry, doctor, but you won't
be able to achieve anything here.

186
00:23:37,711 --> 00:23:40,508
If there were no medical
facilities here...

187
00:23:40,546 --> 00:23:44,538
...why didn't you inform
the management?

188
00:23:44,582 --> 00:23:47,243
How often do I remind them?
And who listens anyway?

189
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:51,750
Take this file to Mr. Saxena
and discuss the contents.

190
00:23:52,689 --> 00:23:53,951
These documents ought
to be despatched today.

191
00:23:55,124 --> 00:23:57,456
On your way back,
do something for me.

192
00:23:57,493 --> 00:23:58,720
I' m expecting a guest on
a plane coming from Calcutta.

193
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:01,855
Receive her and bring
her over to my house.

194
00:24:16,774 --> 00:24:20,141
What are you doing here?

195
00:24:24,513 --> 00:24:27,278
This is an insult, I say!
You' re not happy to see me!

196
00:24:28,583 --> 00:24:32,146
That's not true. I' m indeed
very, very happy to see you

197
00:24:34,522 --> 00:24:36,080
Well... tell me something.
What are doing here?

198
00:24:37,524 --> 00:24:39,287
I' m an engineer in
Dhanraj Companies...

199
00:24:39,326 --> 00:24:42,522
...and the sole member of
your reception committee

200
00:24:42,728 --> 00:24:46,424
Tell me, what are you doing
in Mr. Puri's private plane?

201
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,897
I am now a reputed journalist!

202
00:24:50,736 --> 00:24:53,702
The best of magazines and newspapers
carry my articles.

203
00:24:53,736 --> 00:24:56,967
I' m a much respected personality.
But how would you know?

204
00:24:58,173 --> 00:25:00,972
And you are here to write
an article on coal mines?

205
00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:03,340
Good! You know that too!

206
00:25:04,378 --> 00:25:07,006
I have known you since
our college days.

207
00:25:07,048 --> 00:25:11,279
And this is the first time
you've spoken something sensible.

208
00:25:12,752 --> 00:25:15,084
Where has Mr. Dhanraj Puri
arranged my stay?

209
00:25:16,355 --> 00:25:18,688
Maybe at his house;
there's no hotel here.

210
00:25:21,458 --> 00:25:23,688
My father and Mr. Puri
are old friends.

211
00:25:23,727 --> 00:25:26,696
Even I have known him
since childhood.

212
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:28,960
So I told him that I wanted
to see his mines...

213
00:25:28,999 --> 00:25:31,898
and he said, fly down in
my private plane.

214
00:25:31,933 --> 00:25:34,094
So here I am.
And I meet you, too.

215
00:25:34,704 --> 00:25:37,331
So tell me, are you
married or single?

216
00:25:37,705 --> 00:25:38,900
I' m single.

217
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:41,907
Really? You haven't married
in my grief!

218
00:25:42,175 --> 00:25:43,870
What?!
- Now don't pretend!

219
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:45,672
I know you had a crush on me
during our college days.

220
00:25:45,711 --> 00:25:48,771
Who do you think
you are?

221
00:25:50,748 --> 00:25:52,614
I' m not bad at all!

222
00:25:52,651 --> 00:25:55,642
I' m smart and intelligent and
there's this thing about me...

223
00:25:55,686 --> 00:25:58,813
...which appeals
to people like you

224
00:26:00,789 --> 00:26:01,847
You won't ever change!

225
00:26:18,137 --> 00:26:21,037
Get up, Mangal.
The jailer is coming.

226
00:26:28,411 --> 00:26:34,441
So what if the jailer has come?
Why spoil my sleep?

227
00:26:36,118 --> 00:26:39,747
I told you, because if
you keep him happy...

228
00:26:40,088 --> 00:26:43,351
he may reduce your life term
by a year or two.

229
00:26:45,659 --> 00:26:49,527
Now listen, idiot! Have I fallen
on such bad days...

230
00:26:49,562 --> 00:26:52,792
that I need help from others
to escape?

231
00:26:55,132 --> 00:26:59,569
Actually, I have taken
a liking for this place.

232
00:26:59,703 --> 00:27:02,762
Or I could fly away
anytime I wish.

233
00:27:02,805 --> 00:27:05,365
Oh, c' mon! You' re boasting!

234
00:27:06,974 --> 00:27:11,537
My little boy!
I've been breaking locks...

235
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:15,675
since you were a kid.

236
00:27:17,717 --> 00:27:22,051
You don't know me yet;
but you will, by and by.

237
00:27:26,524 --> 00:27:30,857
We've got to lay dynamite on that
hill. So go on and help them.

238
00:27:32,294 --> 00:27:34,319
You will work
with those guys.

239
00:27:34,363 --> 00:27:36,523
I' ll explain the rest later.

240
00:27:43,704 --> 00:27:46,137
Are you through, Mangal?

241
00:27:46,172 --> 00:27:49,404
Sure thing, sir!
Go ahead and press the button!

242
00:27:50,776 --> 00:27:52,709
Mangal! Move back!

243
00:27:54,679 --> 00:27:56,910
Move back some more!

244
00:27:57,949 --> 00:28:01,213
Crazy chap! Go back, I say!

245
00:28:01,818 --> 00:28:05,413
That's okay.
Go on!

246
00:28:15,396 --> 00:28:17,990
Where is Mangal?
Look for him!

247
00:29:05,302 --> 00:29:07,393
Send copies of the photo
to every police station.

248
00:29:07,435 --> 00:29:10,838
To every bus depot...
And keep a watch for him.

249
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:14,832
This man is a murderer and
was serving a life-term.

250
00:29:14,877 --> 00:29:17,173
It's important that
we arrest him.

251
00:30:02,779 --> 00:30:06,112
Wait... Are you a newcomer?
What's your name?

252
00:30:06,717 --> 00:30:08,685
What day is it today?
- Tuesday (Mangal)

253
00:30:08,719 --> 00:30:10,686
... then write it!

254
00:30:31,937 --> 00:30:33,870
Have you worked in
a mine earlier?

255
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:37,673
Don't tell anyone...
but I was in the jail.

256
00:30:39,075 --> 00:30:41,373
You must be kidding!

257
00:30:41,678 --> 00:30:44,510
Aren't you scared of being
trapped in here someday?

258
00:30:46,148 --> 00:30:47,809
My little boy!

259
00:30:49,084 --> 00:30:52,848
There isn't a place in the world
Mangal cannot get out of!

260
00:30:52,886 --> 00:30:56,014
Get on with your work.
Go on.

261
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:06,222
Before we proceed
to other places...

262
00:31:06,263 --> 00:31:07,730
tell me everything about coal.

263
00:31:07,765 --> 00:31:09,425
What do you want to know?

264
00:31:09,465 --> 00:31:12,491
Where is coal found,
its varieties...

265
00:31:12,535 --> 00:31:17,665
how it is processed,
its uses, etc. etc.

266
00:31:20,341 --> 00:31:23,208
All right. I' ll answer your
questions, one at a time.

267
00:31:25,346 --> 00:31:27,904
Coal is mostly used
in ovens.

268
00:31:27,946 --> 00:31:30,380
There are two types of coal.

269
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:35,281
The first is black in colour
and the other is black, too.

270
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:38,754
So they' re both alike.

271
00:31:38,789 --> 00:31:40,882
As for how it is made...

272
00:31:40,924 --> 00:31:47,122
" Wood burns to coal;
and coal to ashes..."

273
00:31:49,531 --> 00:31:51,863
Old people use it
as a tooth-powder...

274
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:54,892
while teenagers write interesting
graffiti on the walls...

275
00:31:54,936 --> 00:31:57,129
and children use it
to draw whiskers.

276
00:31:58,705 --> 00:32:01,104
There are three types of people
in the business of coal.

277
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:03,472
The one who sells,
the other who buys...

278
00:32:03,509 --> 00:32:05,532
and the third is the broker.

279
00:32:05,576 --> 00:32:08,010
But since you dirty your hands
in selling coal...

280
00:32:08,045 --> 00:32:10,808
it's better to salute such people
rather than shake their hands.

281
00:32:12,616 --> 00:32:17,415
Enough! I know so much about coal!
I know everything!

282
00:32:18,454 --> 00:32:21,650
Thank you. I am grateful.

283
00:32:24,125 --> 00:32:26,354
Ever since I have known you...

284
00:32:26,393 --> 00:32:28,623
this is the second sensible
thing you've said!

285
00:32:32,432 --> 00:32:35,422
Here's my stake.
- Here's mine, too.

286
00:32:35,633 --> 00:32:40,195
Here's another.
- So here's another from me.

287
00:32:41,238 --> 00:32:42,206
I go one further.

288
00:32:42,973 --> 00:32:45,202
Well? You seem to be
gambling heavily today.

289
00:32:45,241 --> 00:32:47,038
Now show me your cards.

290
00:32:47,477 --> 00:32:50,139
A King, Queen and Jack.

291
00:32:51,012 --> 00:32:52,911
Damn it! I've lost all my money!

292
00:32:54,081 --> 00:32:58,347
Bravo, my boy!
How about a hand with me?

293
00:32:58,384 --> 00:33:00,716
Certainly. Sit down.

294
00:33:32,111 --> 00:33:34,341
Here's my stake.

295
00:33:44,654 --> 00:33:48,918
Here's another.
- And here's mine.

296
00:33:53,962 --> 00:33:55,328
Here comes another.

297
00:33:56,364 --> 00:34:01,198
Well... we' re wasting time
in small stakes.

298
00:34:02,968 --> 00:34:05,494
I have a hundred-rupee note.
Here it is.

299
00:34:05,639 --> 00:34:07,764
You stake an equal amount

300
00:34:07,805 --> 00:34:09,670
The one with better cards
takes the money away.

301
00:34:10,208 --> 00:34:11,936
Am I right?
- All right.

302
00:34:13,111 --> 00:34:17,307
You are a newcomer! D'you know
where you' re putting your money?

303
00:34:17,446 --> 00:34:19,437
Nobody ever wins with Rana!

304
00:34:21,182 --> 00:34:22,479
Nobody has ever won
against him...

305
00:34:22,517 --> 00:34:24,712
and I've never been
defeated by anybody.

306
00:34:24,753 --> 00:34:26,446
So let's check it out.

307
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:30,746
Three Jacks!
- Is that all?

308
00:34:34,428 --> 00:34:36,257
Well? What do you have?

309
00:34:37,896 --> 00:34:41,059
I have three Kings.
- Show it to me.

310
00:34:43,902 --> 00:34:48,668
This is the first...
the second...

311
00:34:49,672 --> 00:34:51,640
Show me your third card.

312
00:34:51,674 --> 00:34:57,009
Can't you see, little boy?
I' m the third king!

313
00:34:58,012 --> 00:35:00,674
I am the third king!

314
00:35:07,486 --> 00:35:08,953
This magical ring
will help me, I hope.

315
00:35:08,988 --> 00:35:13,582
Of course! Put in your third finger
and you rule your destiny!

316
00:35:15,626 --> 00:35:18,094
Now watch the miracle!
- Here's your rupee.

317
00:35:20,931 --> 00:35:24,262
Well, lady? What rings
are you selling?

318
00:35:24,299 --> 00:35:26,268
The magical ring!
Will you buy one?

319
00:35:27,035 --> 00:35:28,763
What magical ring is this?

320
00:35:28,869 --> 00:35:31,235
I have heard of only
two types of rings.

321
00:35:31,272 --> 00:35:34,502
One is an engagement ring and
the other is for the wedding.

322
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:39,237
I also sell bangles.
Will you buy some?

323
00:35:39,278 --> 00:35:42,303
Why are you making
fun of an ascetic?

324
00:35:43,647 --> 00:35:46,378
I do wear handcuffs sometimes...

325
00:35:46,417 --> 00:35:48,384
made of iron, and that too,
those of the Government.

326
00:35:48,418 --> 00:35:51,114
Continue behaving like this,
you will wear handcuffs soon.

327
00:35:51,154 --> 00:35:53,018
You' re Mangal, aren't you?

328
00:35:53,055 --> 00:35:55,888
I didn't know my name
has become so popular.

329
00:35:56,159 --> 00:35:59,593
Uncle has told me about you.
- This is just what I hate about him.

330
00:35:59,628 --> 00:36:02,118
He told you everything about me.

331
00:36:02,162 --> 00:36:04,528
But he didn't tell me
anything about you.

332
00:36:06,833 --> 00:36:10,962
By the way, what's your name?
Channo.

333
00:36:11,003 --> 00:36:17,237
God! That sounds like the
jingle of dozens of bangles!

334
00:36:17,274 --> 00:36:19,400
Let me warn you about something.

335
00:36:19,442 --> 00:36:20,999
Poke fun at anyone here.
Go ahead

336
00:36:21,043 --> 00:36:24,479
But there's one chap, Vijay.
Don't you mess with him!

337
00:36:24,513 --> 00:36:27,310
He's straightened out the
most crooked of people!

338
00:36:28,518 --> 00:36:32,008
My innocent gypsy,
you don't know me yet.

339
00:36:33,921 --> 00:36:35,946
But never mind if you don't.

340
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:41,391
The day I meet this chap Vijay...
he' ll have discovered me.

341
00:36:54,704 --> 00:36:56,501
What's so funny?

342
00:36:56,539 --> 00:36:57,698
This is not fair, Tanna!

343
00:36:57,739 --> 00:37:02,402
I have never refused you
food on credit.

344
00:37:02,443 --> 00:37:04,740
But you've received your
salary today. So pay me.

345
00:37:05,379 --> 00:37:06,742
There you go again!

346
00:37:06,779 --> 00:37:10,307
Haven't I told you not to
ask me for money?

347
00:37:10,350 --> 00:37:11,647
Don't you understand?

348
00:37:11,685 --> 00:37:13,948
Why are you bothering us!
Get lost, old man!

349
00:37:13,986 --> 00:37:16,545
I' m demanding only
what is due to me.

350
00:37:16,587 --> 00:37:20,045
Why are you screwing up my mood?
Go away.

351
00:37:22,527 --> 00:37:24,551
So what do you want?

352
00:37:24,594 --> 00:37:26,925
Just give me what
you owe.

353
00:37:26,962 --> 00:37:28,259
What did you say...?

354
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:30,229
You want money, eh?!

355
00:37:32,534 --> 00:37:36,993
Look at them!
They eat at my hotel!

356
00:37:37,037 --> 00:37:39,061
And when I ask for money,...

357
00:37:39,105 --> 00:37:42,541
this is how they treat
an old man!

358
00:37:45,477 --> 00:37:48,036
Give him his money, Tanna.

359
00:38:01,558 --> 00:38:04,252
What are your dues, uncle?
- 55 Rupees.

360
00:38:12,263 --> 00:38:12,855
Here you are.

361
00:39:04,373 --> 00:39:07,431
I could kill him,
if you wish.

362
00:39:07,474 --> 00:39:11,535
Not here, we' ll trap him
in the mines during duty hours.

363
00:39:11,578 --> 00:39:15,377
He's very concerned about
others dues.

364
00:39:15,414 --> 00:39:17,575
I' ll settle my score with him.

365
00:39:27,024 --> 00:39:29,320
According to the
Chief Engineer...

366
00:39:29,358 --> 00:39:32,385
...the van has to be
taken thirty yards ahead.

367
00:39:32,428 --> 00:39:36,386
It's a difficult job.
So I want some strong men.

368
00:39:36,431 --> 00:39:40,263
The whole load is on 4 pillars.
So find someone smart.

369
00:39:42,702 --> 00:39:45,135
If you permit me, sir,
l' m willing to go.

370
00:39:45,171 --> 00:39:47,070
O.K. Go ahead.

371
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,207
Listen...

372
00:39:54,245 --> 00:39:57,042
Is your name Vijay?
- Yes.

373
00:40:01,919 --> 00:40:05,978
Saw how he spoke, sir?
He's a courageous man.

374
00:41:13,875 --> 00:41:14,808
Anybody there?

375
00:41:17,678 --> 00:41:19,838
Let's go. That's the siren.

376
00:41:34,757 --> 00:41:37,954
Has the man working
in the new tunnel, left?

377
00:41:37,994 --> 00:41:39,584
I didn't see him....

378
00:41:41,795 --> 00:41:43,887
Perhaps he's left.
Let's go, Sir.

379
00:41:45,132 --> 00:41:47,294
Only four of us can go on the lift.
Go ahead. I' ll follow you.

380
00:44:05,409 --> 00:44:07,173
Take him to the hospital.
Quick!

381
00:44:07,878 --> 00:44:11,176
Jinxed mine! There are
accidents every day.

382
00:44:12,048 --> 00:44:16,279
HoW's Dhanna?
- He's a scoundrel.

383
00:44:16,385 --> 00:44:18,181
There's no love lost
between Vijay and him.

384
00:44:19,154 --> 00:44:21,814
Why? What happened, sir?
- Nothing

385
00:44:23,390 --> 00:44:27,487
Your injuries are deep.
Coal has entered your wounds.

386
00:44:27,861 --> 00:44:29,487
Cleaning that could be
very painful.

387
00:44:29,528 --> 00:44:31,519
I' ll give you an anesthesia.

388
00:44:31,563 --> 00:44:34,588
There's no need for an injection.
You can bandage it.

389
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:37,663
It' ll be very painful
- That doesn't matter

390
00:45:29,809 --> 00:45:30,901
Watch out!

391
00:45:33,612 --> 00:45:37,910
The rascal has escaped!
But he has learnt his lesson!

392
00:45:39,450 --> 00:45:42,180
Get us three lemonades
with ice. Quick!

393
00:45:43,352 --> 00:45:45,979
Bring it quickly, or else
l' ll bury you right here.

394
00:46:24,751 --> 00:46:25,718
Sir...
- l' m sorry.

395
00:46:28,489 --> 00:46:32,515
Have you ever tried
peanuts with lemonade?

396
00:46:33,358 --> 00:46:34,586
It's a different kind of fun.

397
00:46:34,626 --> 00:46:40,860
Sour and sweet.
Try it today.

398
00:46:43,867 --> 00:46:45,563
Do you know who I am?

399
00:46:54,242 --> 00:46:57,109
Yes, I do.
You' re the local bully.

400
00:46:59,813 --> 00:47:02,473
But tell me. What does
bullying get you?

401
00:47:08,354 --> 00:47:10,913
I've heard from workers
that you harass them...

402
00:47:11,955 --> 00:47:15,357
that you extort money
from them.

403
00:47:22,397 --> 00:47:23,455
You should be punished for it.

404
00:47:29,403 --> 00:47:31,802
If I ever see you
creating any problems...

405
00:47:31,838 --> 00:47:34,306
I won't report you.

406
00:47:34,407 --> 00:47:38,843
But l' ll give you a thrashing
that will teach you a lesson!

407
00:47:46,715 --> 00:47:52,483
Have a cold drink.
- Forgive us, sir.

408
00:48:09,601 --> 00:48:11,762
How are you, Vijay?
Is your leg any better?

409
00:48:12,436 --> 00:48:15,302
It must've healed by now.
- Let's open the bandage.

410
00:48:21,443 --> 00:48:23,412
Your job is really risky.

411
00:48:25,814 --> 00:48:27,645
You don't seem to belong
to this place.

412
00:48:28,684 --> 00:48:31,550
Which place are you from?
How long have you been here?

413
00:48:33,552 --> 00:48:39,286
I can't remember. I've stopped
keeping a count of days.

414
00:48:40,459 --> 00:48:42,359
Who must keep track of that?

415
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:45,755
As for the question of the
place I belong to...

416
00:48:48,398 --> 00:48:50,958
there are people
who belong nowhere.

417
00:48:53,335 --> 00:48:57,896
Looks like you don't want to
talk about yourself.

418
00:49:00,475 --> 00:49:03,566
And what do I say?
There is nothing much anyway.

419
00:49:06,180 --> 00:49:07,942
Just a useless life
which l' m leading.

420
00:49:09,482 --> 00:49:11,415
May I say something to you?

421
00:49:11,450 --> 00:49:20,084
I don't know why, but I feel
you are angry with yourself.

422
00:49:23,492 --> 00:49:24,823
How did you find out?

423
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:28,392
That day you refused to
take anesthesia.

424
00:49:28,430 --> 00:49:34,367
Later, I felt that you were
deliberately being hard on yourself.

425
00:49:35,936 --> 00:49:38,460
Like working in the coal-mines,
for instance.

426
00:49:38,504 --> 00:49:41,403
That could be for the
same purpose too.

427
00:49:43,808 --> 00:49:44,604
Why have you come here?

428
00:49:46,444 --> 00:49:48,605
No lady doctor has ever
come here before you.

429
00:49:51,180 --> 00:49:53,479
You are a woman.
And you' re all alone...

430
00:49:53,517 --> 00:49:55,074
at a place like this.

431
00:49:57,453 --> 00:49:59,214
You must have a reason too.

432
00:50:05,860 --> 00:50:07,418
Yes, I do.

433
00:50:13,732 --> 00:50:15,426
I do have a reason.

434
00:50:16,801 --> 00:50:18,768
It happened one night when
my father returned from the farm.

435
00:50:18,802 --> 00:50:24,035
He was drenched in the rains.
He was running a fever.

436
00:50:25,006 --> 00:50:28,841
His condition deteriorated
in the night.

437
00:50:30,745 --> 00:50:32,372
But, in the village we lived,...

438
00:50:32,414 --> 00:50:38,181
there wasn't a doctor
or hospital for miles.

439
00:50:40,286 --> 00:50:44,119
I can't tell you what
a night of despair that was.

440
00:50:44,156 --> 00:50:51,561
I was small then.
But I sat at his side...

441
00:50:51,595 --> 00:50:55,552
and watched him die
a slow and painful death.

442
00:50:57,599 --> 00:51:00,567
He died in the early
hours of the morning.

443
00:51:01,837 --> 00:51:05,169
My relatives looked after me,
educated me...

444
00:51:05,206 --> 00:51:08,767
I wanted to be a doctor.
And I did become one.

445
00:51:09,810 --> 00:51:12,404
In the hope that on
becoming a doctor...

446
00:51:14,814 --> 00:51:20,581
I'd go to places where a
doctor is needed most,...

447
00:51:20,618 --> 00:51:25,246
as my village did
that night.

448
00:51:33,594 --> 00:51:35,721
It's very strange.

449
00:51:38,933 --> 00:51:42,458
On the one hand,
I see you fighting life...

450
00:51:44,068 --> 00:51:46,129
and on the other hand,
I am running away from life.

451
00:51:49,241 --> 00:51:54,371
My leg is okay now.

452
00:51:56,413 --> 00:52:00,213
I might not need to
come here again.

453
00:52:01,583 --> 00:52:03,278
Yes, your leg is okay.

454
00:52:07,088 --> 00:52:08,385
My name is Sudha.

455
00:52:28,372 --> 00:52:31,203
Quiet!

456
00:52:32,841 --> 00:52:35,036
You won't get your rights by
shouting in this manner!

457
00:52:35,076 --> 00:52:37,045
We want our rights!

458
00:52:37,079 --> 00:52:39,069
Kicking up a fuss won't
get you your rights.

459
00:52:39,113 --> 00:52:40,977
You must talk to the boss.

460
00:52:41,114 --> 00:52:44,549
Why don't you talk to him
on our behalf?

461
00:52:44,583 --> 00:52:50,748
Okay, but on one condition.
You will stop shouting.

462
00:52:56,794 --> 00:52:59,317
We agree!

463
00:53:05,768 --> 00:53:09,567
May I come in, sir?
- Come in Mr. Malhotra

464
00:53:11,405 --> 00:53:13,999
So you have become the
leader of the workers?

465
00:53:14,408 --> 00:53:19,742
No sir. I have only brought
their legitimate demands.

466
00:53:19,778 --> 00:53:23,805
Whether their demand is legitimate
or not, will be decided by me alone.

467
00:53:24,782 --> 00:53:27,045
And I don't think,
their demands are justified.

468
00:53:27,351 --> 00:53:32,344
Why not? If those working
in your dark mines...

469
00:53:32,389 --> 00:53:38,382
...demand one square meal,
is that an illegitimate demand?

470
00:53:39,427 --> 00:53:42,952
Workers who risk their lives
and help you profit in millions...

471
00:53:43,363 --> 00:53:47,230
...and demand just a fraction of
your revenues, is it illegitimate?

472
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,969
Now stop lecturing me.
You are just a kid

473
00:53:51,003 --> 00:53:53,335
The more you give, the
more they will demand!

474
00:53:53,371 --> 00:53:55,031
I' m giving them
a month's bonus.

475
00:53:55,073 --> 00:53:57,131
Is that less?
- Yes, it is less.

476
00:53:57,174 --> 00:54:00,507
Because you' re getting them to sign
on vouchers of three months' bonus!

477
00:54:00,544 --> 00:54:03,137
It won't break their hands to
put their thumb-impression!

478
00:54:04,346 --> 00:54:08,509
They only want to harass me.
I know these scoundrels very well.

479
00:54:09,318 --> 00:54:11,308
Do you really know
these "scoundrels"?

480
00:54:12,385 --> 00:54:15,548
Do you know in what conditions
a worker lives?

481
00:54:15,589 --> 00:54:18,113
Do you know even after
working so hard...

482
00:54:18,157 --> 00:54:20,022
... he is always covered
in debts?

483
00:54:20,059 --> 00:54:23,459
Do you know in what condition
their wives and children live?

484
00:54:23,495 --> 00:54:26,191
Have you ever gone
to their colony?

485
00:54:26,231 --> 00:54:30,964
You don't know the people
who live here.

486
00:54:33,003 --> 00:54:35,800
All you know is your
bank balance!

487
00:54:35,838 --> 00:54:37,829
Do you know whom
you are talking to?

488
00:54:37,874 --> 00:54:42,309
I do. I also know what I am saying.
And the possible outcome, too.

489
00:54:43,344 --> 00:54:48,280
But I'd never dump justice
for a two-penny job, Mr Puri!

490
00:54:48,348 --> 00:54:50,815
This nonsense won't
get you anywhere.

491
00:54:50,849 --> 00:54:53,374
You' re going to get bonus
only for one month.

492
00:54:53,418 --> 00:54:54,816
And this is my final decision!

493
00:54:54,852 --> 00:54:56,616
We will get bonus for three months.

494
00:54:56,655 --> 00:55:01,181
And how you give it to us
is your look-out.

495
00:55:38,287 --> 00:55:42,417
I accept the workers' demand.
They' ll get 3 months bonus.

496
00:55:51,264 --> 00:55:54,893
What have you done? I thought
you'd sack the insolent man. But...

497
00:55:56,068 --> 00:55:58,695
When Ravi came here...

498
00:55:58,736 --> 00:56:01,398
...he had extracted a promise
from workers to remain peaceful.

499
00:56:03,140 --> 00:56:05,334
I went out because, before
taking any further step...

500
00:56:06,076 --> 00:56:09,943
I wanted to ascertain what impression
Ravi has made on these workers.

501
00:56:10,446 --> 00:56:13,278
I tried to instigate them.
But they were quiet.

502
00:56:13,315 --> 00:56:19,013
Workers who can remain silent because
of a promise made to Ravi...

503
00:56:19,052 --> 00:56:24,251
...can even shut our mines
if Ravi were dismissed.

504
00:56:25,158 --> 00:56:27,318
So wait for sometime

505
00:56:28,327 --> 00:56:32,263
I' ll certainly throw him out,
but only at the right time.

506
00:56:33,197 --> 00:56:35,687
Victory to Mr. Ravi!

507
00:56:48,176 --> 00:56:49,541
"There's happiness all around"

508
00:56:50,811 --> 00:56:55,440
"This night is joyous
and the heart leaps"

509
00:57:04,955 --> 00:57:08,186
" Let us speak of the story
till dawn..."

510
00:57:08,325 --> 00:57:11,521
"with hearts so filled with joy"

511
00:58:03,801 --> 00:58:05,360
" As long as the night lasts..."

512
00:58:07,771 --> 00:58:09,762
" let's mutter sweet-nothings"

513
00:58:11,574 --> 00:58:14,475
" Let not our eyes
drift into sleep"

514
00:58:15,377 --> 00:58:19,107
" Let the colours sparkle
and the bodies rejoice..."

515
00:58:20,313 --> 00:58:22,474
" Let our faces too
come alive with passion"

516
00:58:24,886 --> 00:58:28,251
" For God's sake, do not
torment me anymore"

517
00:58:28,288 --> 00:58:31,483
"Give me a ring as
a souvenir..."

518
00:58:31,523 --> 00:58:35,620
" l' ll remain indebted to you"

519
00:58:35,661 --> 00:58:39,459
" What do you take me for?"

520
00:58:39,496 --> 00:58:43,295
"The one I hit
remains hit"

521
00:59:34,972 --> 00:59:38,067
" Let the mischief increase...
Iet our intoxication rise"

522
00:59:38,110 --> 00:59:41,636
" I can't think of
anything sad today"

523
00:59:41,678 --> 00:59:45,638
" If one were overcome by sorrows;
and tormented by grief..."

524
00:59:45,682 --> 00:59:49,208
" Man must never panic"

525
00:59:51,252 --> 00:59:55,153
" l' ll die of this sorrow..."

526
00:59:55,188 --> 00:59:58,851
" May daughter be a bride"

527
00:59:59,326 --> 01:00:02,885
" May she not spend her
life as a spinster"

528
01:00:03,829 --> 01:00:05,227
" Difficulties come
and go..."

529
01:00:05,965 --> 01:00:09,922
"That is the preaching
of our revered Guru"

530
01:01:00,007 --> 01:01:04,707
" Where there's no sorrow,
and everyone is happy..."

531
01:01:06,212 --> 01:01:10,442
"That is the world
we must create"

532
01:01:10,481 --> 01:01:12,210
" With fire in our hearts..."

533
01:01:12,249 --> 01:01:14,616
" and a song on our lips..."

534
01:01:14,653 --> 01:01:17,848
"we must light up the dark paths"

535
01:01:20,222 --> 01:01:23,521
" I swear by these stones,
as long as I live..."

536
01:01:23,559 --> 01:01:27,426
"...I will abide by these
great old traditions"

537
01:01:27,461 --> 01:01:31,453
" And not let anyone
dictate to us"

538
01:01:31,498 --> 01:01:34,592
"This is now my resolve..."

539
01:01:34,633 --> 01:01:38,763
"we will usher in
an era so beautiful"

540
01:01:39,803 --> 01:01:42,237
"There is joy all around..."

541
01:01:42,272 --> 01:01:47,505
"Tonight, every youth
shall stay up till dawn"

542
01:01:57,018 --> 01:02:00,043
" Let's talk of the story
till dawn..."

543
01:02:00,087 --> 01:02:03,851
"with hearts so
full of happiness"

544
01:02:45,724 --> 01:02:47,953
The workers have
been celebrating.

545
01:02:47,992 --> 01:02:51,585
And they don't even know what
dangers they are courting.

546
01:02:51,628 --> 01:02:57,292
They don't know what can happen.
- They know it.

547
01:02:58,834 --> 01:03:03,099
Every man working
in Puri's mines...

548
01:03:03,137 --> 01:03:07,163
buys himself a shroud
with his salary.

549
01:03:07,207 --> 01:03:09,573
But l' m talking of
another situation.

550
01:03:09,609 --> 01:03:12,099
Should that happen...

551
01:03:12,144 --> 01:03:16,102
no man working in the mines
will even find a shroud.

552
01:03:16,214 --> 01:03:18,647
What do you mean?
- Just a minute.

553
01:03:21,150 --> 01:03:21,172
Let me tell you, Vijay.

554
01:03:22,218 --> 01:03:24,414
This is the mine we are
presently working in.

555
01:03:25,621 --> 01:03:27,679
This is tunnel number
1, 2 and 3.

556
01:03:28,723 --> 01:03:30,781
This is tunnel no. 4...

557
01:03:31,825 --> 01:03:34,658
and we' re proceeding down here,
extracting coal.

558
01:03:34,695 --> 01:03:36,991
There's water here.

559
01:03:38,031 --> 01:03:41,021
And the distance between tunnel no.4
and the water is fast decreasing...

560
01:03:41,065 --> 01:03:43,501
and the danger is rising.

561
01:03:44,237 --> 01:03:46,635
Give it a thought.

562
01:03:48,539 --> 01:03:50,870
What happens if the water
enters the tunnel?

563
01:03:51,242 --> 01:03:53,938
There are approximately 350-400
workers to a shift.

564
01:03:54,977 --> 01:03:58,208
And this mine may turn
into a watery grave.

565
01:03:58,247 --> 01:04:01,148
No one will survive.

566
01:04:07,721 --> 01:04:09,381
The day you think we' re
heading for disaster...

567
01:04:11,424 --> 01:04:14,984
just let me know

568
01:04:15,793 --> 01:04:21,733
I do remain silent. But silence
at times, is an offence. A sin.

569
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:27,261
It is at times like this that
I speak up. So please let me know.

570
01:04:29,305 --> 01:04:31,500
I must leave now.

571
01:04:36,210 --> 01:04:38,872
I wonder if you've noticed...

572
01:04:40,213 --> 01:04:43,977
there is something
strange about this man._Yes.

573
01:04:46,986 --> 01:04:51,081
Whenever I see him, I am reminded
of the simmering mines of Dhanbad...

574
01:04:51,122 --> 01:04:52,850
where millions of
tons of coal burn.

575
01:04:55,257 --> 01:05:00,193
I don't know what's
burning in him and why?

576
01:05:14,707 --> 01:05:16,867
Quickly make some buttermilk for me.
Okay, my boy?

577
01:05:17,909 --> 01:05:20,435
Get to work.

578
01:05:24,482 --> 01:05:26,676
Give me a match.

579
01:05:44,965 --> 01:05:47,592
Isn't that buttermilk ready yet?
Hurry up!

580
01:05:47,633 --> 01:05:49,293
Bring it, quick!

581
01:06:25,229 --> 01:06:27,196
Did you send for me?
- Yes, Vijay,

582
01:06:27,230 --> 01:06:30,631
The machines I told about
are ready in the workshop.

583
01:06:30,667 --> 01:06:32,931
This truck is headed that way.
So go with it.

584
01:06:32,969 --> 01:06:35,459
All right.
- Take delivery in your presence.

585
01:06:35,504 --> 01:06:37,563
I' ll be assured if
you handle this.

586
01:06:40,607 --> 01:06:44,940
I've deputed a worker to
help you out. Go ahead.

587
01:06:44,977 --> 01:06:47,069
Take him with you.
- Very well, sir.

588
01:07:42,456 --> 01:07:44,185
Stop the truck, driver.
- Why, What's the matter?

589
01:07:44,225 --> 01:07:46,351
I want to take a leak.

590
01:07:50,897 --> 01:07:52,659
What are you doing?!

591
01:07:52,698 --> 01:07:56,030
Can't you see?
I' m taking the keys.

592
01:07:57,068 --> 01:07:59,628
Actually, l' m feeling
very hungry.

593
01:07:59,670 --> 01:08:02,000
I' ll have some food
in that inn there.

594
01:08:02,438 --> 01:08:05,407
Till then you wait here.
- But l' m on duty.

595
01:08:05,441 --> 01:08:09,468
Well, idiot! Is your duty more
important than my hunger?

596
01:08:09,512 --> 01:08:11,535
Just you sit here!

597
01:08:14,482 --> 01:08:18,007
Make some buttermilk
for me quickly.

598
01:08:45,173 --> 01:08:48,232
Are you listening, my boy?
Get me the pancakes!

599
01:09:09,558 --> 01:09:11,617
Ravi Malhotra has ordered
some new machinery.

600
01:09:11,660 --> 01:09:16,653
That' ll make work for the labour
easier, and ensure safety too.

601
01:09:17,697 --> 01:09:21,998
Are we working for our profits
or is it to make work easier?

602
01:09:22,035 --> 01:09:25,332
And those who feel there's no
safety, or fear for their lives...

603
01:09:25,369 --> 01:09:27,894
can very well quit
and go away.

604
01:09:27,939 --> 01:09:29,133
We are not forcing them
to work for us.

605
01:09:29,173 --> 01:09:32,733
There's no need to incur such
useless expenses in the future.

606
01:09:35,144 --> 01:09:36,339
Make sure you tell
Ravi Malhotra too.

607
01:10:26,885 --> 01:10:28,580
Come here, Gyan.
- Coming, sir

608
01:10:29,122 --> 01:10:30,383
Hello, Vijay.

609
01:10:37,628 --> 01:10:41,563
Gyan, bring me a cup of tea.
- In a moment, sir.

610
01:10:43,566 --> 01:10:45,123
Hold it!

611
01:10:46,101 --> 01:10:49,695
Who came here first?
- You did, sir.

612
01:10:49,737 --> 01:10:52,728
Who called you first?
- It was you, sir.

613
01:10:53,772 --> 01:10:57,038
So, I must get the tea first.
- But he asked for it, sir...

614
01:10:57,076 --> 01:10:59,599
Your mistake! Why didn't
you take my order first?

615
01:10:59,644 --> 01:11:01,306
So keep it on my table.

616
01:11:03,115 --> 01:11:08,346
I asked for that tea. And so
it' ll come to my table first.

617
01:11:12,122 --> 01:11:15,318
Bring that tea here!

618
01:11:15,758 --> 01:11:17,725
The tea will come
to this table.

619
01:11:17,759 --> 01:11:19,192
Don't you dare!

620
01:11:25,632 --> 01:11:28,360
Move a step further and
l' ll break both your legs!

621
01:11:43,546 --> 01:11:46,037
You'd better give it to me, Gyan.

622
01:11:48,082 --> 01:11:51,483
I haven't had any since morning.
So don't mind it, guys.

623
01:11:53,921 --> 01:11:55,582
That was nice.

624
01:11:55,623 --> 01:11:57,111
You haven't given me the papers
you brought from the workshop...

625
01:11:57,156 --> 01:11:59,124
... bring it to my office.

626
01:12:33,152 --> 01:12:35,311
You?
- Raghunath is ill.

627
01:12:35,353 --> 01:12:37,845
If you could...
- Certainly.

628
01:12:37,889 --> 01:12:40,015
Come in. I' ll
fetch my kit.

629
01:13:01,141 --> 01:13:05,600
Lets go.
Give it to me.

630
01:13:21,823 --> 01:13:23,915
Although he' ll feel better
with this injection...

631
01:13:23,958 --> 01:13:26,051
ask him to stop drinking.

632
01:13:26,093 --> 01:13:28,617
And bring him to
my clinic tomorrow.

633
01:13:39,103 --> 01:13:41,072
Come from this side.

634
01:13:41,106 --> 01:13:43,971
I can't see anything
in this darkness.

635
01:13:44,007 --> 01:13:45,669
How can you see your way?

636
01:13:46,109 --> 01:13:48,077
I' m used to this darkness.

637
01:13:49,545 --> 01:13:51,536
This darkness is
for a little while.

638
01:13:52,580 --> 01:13:54,241
There's light ahead.

639
01:13:56,284 --> 01:13:58,477
Yes, maybe there's
light ahead.

640
01:14:19,302 --> 01:14:27,866
" Love and trouble can
never be hidden..."

641
01:14:30,177 --> 01:14:35,046
"try as much as you may"

642
01:14:37,082 --> 01:14:42,644
"or avoid the gaze of
those who probe"

643
01:15:00,335 --> 01:15:03,303
" Love is the gift of
the merciful Lord"

644
01:15:22,952 --> 01:15:30,755
"The Moon shall have
its place in the skies..."

645
01:15:31,358 --> 01:15:35,316
"So why pretend and
deny the obvious"

646
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:47,703
"Oh Jagga... Iove,
you can never hide"

647
01:16:25,669 --> 01:16:30,570
"Should you find your love
in this crowded world..."

648
01:16:39,479 --> 01:16:50,284
"consider yourself fortunate
and be thankful to God"

649
01:17:07,868 --> 01:17:17,831
"Should you get a heart
in exchange for yours..."

650
01:17:30,351 --> 01:17:32,444
" lose no time in
settling for it"

651
01:17:32,486 --> 01:17:36,922
" And transport the heavens
that are in the skies..."

652
01:17:41,828 --> 01:17:43,852
" here on this earth"

653
01:17:52,704 --> 01:17:57,299
"Oh Jagga... Iove,
you can never hide"

654
01:18:27,596 --> 01:18:29,588
Excuse me.
- Me?

655
01:18:34,636 --> 01:18:37,866
Do you live here?
- Yes, near the station.

656
01:18:37,904 --> 01:18:40,964
What do you do for a living?
- l' m an insurance agent.

657
01:18:41,008 --> 01:18:42,907
Why? What's the matter?
- Don't worry.

658
01:18:42,942 --> 01:18:45,308
Have you seen this man around?

659
01:18:47,345 --> 01:18:49,677
No, he doesn't stay here.

660
01:18:49,714 --> 01:18:52,978
I know all the people
working in this area.

661
01:18:53,816 --> 01:18:56,546
I wouldn't be able to say
if he's working at the mines.

662
01:19:13,466 --> 01:19:16,162
Why are you coming here?
Join the queue!

663
01:19:17,636 --> 01:19:21,036
I make my own queue.

664
01:19:24,042 --> 01:19:27,499
Hello, Madam...
I have a cold since yesterday.

665
01:19:28,511 --> 01:19:30,944
You' ll get your medicine,
but come in the queue.

666
01:19:30,979 --> 01:19:33,676
People have been waiting
long before you arrived.

667
01:19:34,449 --> 01:19:37,576
I don't want you to check my pulse
and wait for an hour.

668
01:19:37,618 --> 01:19:39,018
The medicine for a cold
are lying there.

669
01:19:39,053 --> 01:19:41,818
Give it to me
so I may leave.

670
01:19:41,856 --> 01:19:44,380
Only those patients who join
the queue get the medicines.

671
01:19:44,424 --> 01:19:47,187
I' m busy examining a patient.
So don't disturb me.

672
01:19:48,994 --> 01:19:50,723
You do talk big, madam.

673
01:19:51,063 --> 01:19:53,997
You don't know me.

674
01:19:54,031 --> 01:19:56,294
Now look! Don't you
misbehave with me!

675
01:20:03,439 --> 01:20:05,237
Keep the medicine there
and get out!

676
01:20:07,176 --> 01:20:09,405
I' m quiet because
you are a woman.

677
01:20:10,310 --> 01:20:12,471
Had your Vijay spoken
like this to me...

678
01:20:13,513 --> 01:20:15,537
I'd have cut him into pieces.

679
01:20:26,724 --> 01:20:28,623
The poor thing...
she cried so much.

680
01:20:38,833 --> 01:20:41,394
Why are you shouting?
Have the mines caught fire?

681
01:20:41,436 --> 01:20:44,062
Vijay is looking for you.
He looked very angry.

682
01:20:47,040 --> 01:20:49,031
Vijay is very dangerous man.
Just be careful.

683
01:20:50,042 --> 01:20:52,600
Shut up! I've been waiting
for this day, too.

684
01:20:57,481 --> 01:20:58,949
Have you seen Mangal?

685
01:20:58,983 --> 01:21:01,008
No, I haven't seen him
since yesterday.

686
01:21:04,988 --> 01:21:09,788
I've seen Mangal.
He's at uncle's eatery.

687
01:21:09,992 --> 01:21:12,220
When did you see him?
- Just now.

688
01:21:12,660 --> 01:21:14,456
He entered the eatery
even as I was leaving.

689
01:21:18,030 --> 01:21:20,555
Vijay is coming this way!
- Let him come.

690
01:21:41,816 --> 01:21:43,909
What's your name?

691
01:21:46,420 --> 01:21:49,444
How long have you been working here?
- Why?

692
01:21:49,488 --> 01:21:51,456
Have you seen this man?

693
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:08,369
No, this man is not here.

694
01:24:28,851 --> 01:24:32,844
Why are you running away?!
Cowards! Come back!

695
01:24:44,467 --> 01:24:47,436
Now what are you crying for?

696
01:24:49,071 --> 01:24:51,471
If you' re sad they've left,
shall I call them back?

697
01:24:53,409 --> 01:24:55,604
Stop crying like a girl!

698
01:24:57,446 --> 01:25:00,882
Where were you going all alone,
in such a huge forest?

699
01:25:47,630 --> 01:25:53,830
" My groom has come from far away
to take me with him"

700
01:26:02,511 --> 01:26:05,969
" He's young and handsome,
he has won over my heart"

701
01:26:06,782 --> 01:26:08,750
" His attire is colourful"

702
01:26:08,784 --> 01:26:13,016
" My heart goes out to him"

703
01:26:15,191 --> 01:26:18,183
" As soon as he stepped
in my courtyard..."

704
01:26:19,562 --> 01:26:21,530
"...my heart leapt with joy"

705
01:26:23,733 --> 01:26:27,464
" I will no longer stay
with my parents..."

706
01:26:27,503 --> 01:26:30,438
" I must go away, mother"

707
01:26:54,063 --> 01:26:57,464
" You've stolen my heart,
so sweetly have you spoken"

708
01:26:58,401 --> 01:27:04,806
" I lay wounded... your piercing
look has done that"

709
01:27:12,615 --> 01:27:16,642
" I see your face even
while I look at the mirror"

710
01:27:20,556 --> 01:27:27,792
" I don't like separations;
but I must go, mother"

711
01:27:53,500 --> 01:28:00,440
The middlemen are the only problem.
This chap Ravi Malhotra, for example.

712
01:28:03,470 --> 01:28:05,932
On one hand, he's trying
to fool the workers...

713
01:28:06,032 --> 01:28:07,995
... and on the other hand,
he's trying to blackmail me.

714
01:28:08,195 --> 01:28:11,082
We ought to be rid
of people like him.

715
01:28:11,449 --> 01:28:16,395
Do you get my point?
- Yes, I get it.

716
01:28:17,634 --> 01:28:20,114
If I get rid of Ravi Malhotra...

717
01:28:20,291 --> 01:28:23,716
...you will appoint me
as a Welfare Officer.

718
01:28:25,146 --> 01:28:26,631
Yes, you could put it that way.

719
01:28:26,711 --> 01:28:29,692
I even understand that if
I become the welfare officer...

720
01:28:29,833 --> 01:28:32,757
I' ll get a bungalow,
a car, other perks...

721
01:28:32,793 --> 01:28:36,613
...the salary I wish,
5000-10000.

722
01:28:36,716 --> 01:28:38,270
Right?
- Right on!

723
01:28:38,712 --> 01:28:40,671
I haven't made your drink!

724
01:28:42,302 --> 01:28:46,723
You've explained everything, sir.
Except one factor.

725
01:28:48,020 --> 01:28:50,238
How will I eliminate
Ravi Malhotra?

726
01:28:50,612 --> 01:28:52,405
Must I tell you that too?

727
01:28:53,270 --> 01:28:56,025
You are young and brave!
And hot-blooded too.

728
01:28:56,989 --> 01:28:59,011
If you make up your mind,
there's no problem.

729
01:28:59,255 --> 01:29:00,274
Didn't you tell me
the other day...

730
01:29:00,420 --> 01:29:02,637
that there are mishaps in
the mines every other day?

731
01:29:02,978 --> 01:29:07,193
And don't worry. I' ll help you out,
if there's a problem later.

732
01:29:07,400 --> 01:29:09,516
I' m ready to spend any
amount of money on you.

733
01:29:10,222 --> 01:29:11,381
Here you are.

734
01:29:15,209 --> 01:29:17,471
I believe you, sir.

735
01:29:19,032 --> 01:29:21,821
You can shed human blood
like water...

736
01:29:22,023 --> 01:29:24,214
you are capable of anything.

737
01:29:27,245 --> 01:29:29,071
You still don't know me!

738
01:29:29,508 --> 01:29:32,930
Not true, sir.
I have got to know you today.

739
01:29:33,098 --> 01:29:35,182
I admit, I didn't
know you till today.

740
01:29:35,821 --> 01:29:39,267
All that I gathered about you
was wrong.

741
01:29:40,077 --> 01:29:43,997
I thought you were a
conceited and wicked man.

742
01:29:46,294 --> 01:29:51,334
But you can't be that,
even if you want to.

743
01:29:51,878 --> 01:29:55,395
Because you are not human at all,
you are an animal.

744
01:29:56,035 --> 01:29:59,014
A wild beast who drinks
the blood of these workers...

745
01:29:59,090 --> 01:30:01,017
and feasts on their flesh!

746
01:30:01,687 --> 01:30:05,434
I don't hate you at this moment.
I find you repulsive!

747
01:30:06,468 --> 01:30:08,952
Shame on you, Dhanraj Puri.
Shame on you!

748
01:30:21,763 --> 01:30:22,951
Hello Sir!

749
01:30:22,995 --> 01:30:25,679
I've agreed to pay him
5000 for this work, sir.

750
01:30:26,614 --> 01:30:29,510
Saxena must have told you
what you've got to do?

751
01:30:29,544 --> 01:30:31,661
You need not worry, sir.
The engineer won't live anymore.

752
01:30:31,702 --> 01:30:33,561
Your work will be done.

753
01:30:34,596 --> 01:30:37,675
Sir, work stopped by you in
tunnel No.4 has begun again.

754
01:30:37,723 --> 01:30:42,640
With whose permission?
- Mr. Saxena was here, sir.

755
01:30:43,702 --> 01:30:45,787
All right. Go ahead.
I' ll look into it.

756
01:30:57,535 --> 01:30:58,926
Here comes our engineer.

757
01:30:58,961 --> 01:31:01,320
Look at this, sir.

758
01:31:03,781 --> 01:31:06,207
What is it?
- I don't know. Take a look, sir.

759
01:31:12,293 --> 01:31:14,773
So, Engineer,... do I feed
you some peanuts now?

760
01:31:20,435 --> 01:31:21,831
Can't you see?
Coal in your eyes, eh?

761
01:31:30,107 --> 01:31:32,624
You have made us and
the boss your enemies!

762
01:31:32,706 --> 01:31:35,322
That was a mistake you made!

763
01:31:37,288 --> 01:31:39,715
So many of you
against just one?!

764
01:31:40,948 --> 01:31:43,274
How am I to blame if
you' re all alone?

765
01:31:43,309 --> 01:31:47,591
There were those you fought for!
So call them now!

766
01:31:52,617 --> 01:31:54,734
Please sit here, sir.

767
01:32:01,058 --> 01:32:03,484
You' re gonna die today!

768
01:32:04,216 --> 01:32:06,143
You won't escape...
you' re gonna die today!

769
01:33:26,230 --> 01:33:28,814
What' re you doing here?
Go and dig there.

770
01:33:33,571 --> 01:33:36,088
Give me a shovel.
- A shovel?

771
01:33:36,832 --> 01:33:38,816
Take that one lying
near that box.

772
01:34:23,936 --> 01:34:25,094
Switch off the machine!

773
01:34:45,246 --> 01:34:47,069
Carry him!

774
01:34:49,931 --> 01:34:52,118
Take him to the hospital!
Quick!

775
01:35:30,189 --> 01:35:31,674
Mangal is still unconscious.

776
01:35:32,386 --> 01:35:35,241
He has lost a lot of blood.
He needs blood.

777
01:35:37,405 --> 01:35:39,391
Who among you is willing
to donate blood for him?

778
01:36:04,362 --> 01:36:06,326
What are you thinking about?
- Nothing.

779
01:36:07,290 --> 01:36:09,309
I have recovered now.

780
01:36:10,350 --> 01:36:12,070
I' ll be discharged in
a day or two.

781
01:36:12,606 --> 01:36:15,295
May I say something?
Once you' re discharged...

782
01:36:15,332 --> 01:36:17,817
you must forget your enemity.

783
01:36:18,858 --> 01:36:22,075
Had he not carried you
and brought you here,...

784
01:36:23,246 --> 01:36:24,827
had he not given
his blood to you,...

785
01:36:24,877 --> 01:36:26,771
there were very little chances
of your survival.

786
01:36:26,805 --> 01:36:29,557
Whom are you talking about?
Who was it?

787
01:36:38,804 --> 01:36:41,454
Did you call on Mangal?
- Yes, I did.

788
01:36:41,497 --> 01:36:43,716
He's fine now.
He was asking for you.

789
01:36:53,063 --> 01:36:54,585
You are under arrest.

790
01:36:57,785 --> 01:36:59,937
You ought to have either
arrested me much earlier...

791
01:37:00,977 --> 01:37:04,762
or atleast a few days later.
Well, that's all right.

792
01:37:05,366 --> 01:37:07,327
Let's go.

793
01:37:29,532 --> 01:37:31,322
You crib about something
every day!

794
01:37:31,359 --> 01:37:32,949
There is no danger for
the workers!

795
01:37:32,990 --> 01:37:34,746
I can't stop work just
because you say so!

796
01:37:34,783 --> 01:37:36,436
The workers lives
are in danger!

797
01:37:36,481 --> 01:37:38,170
I can't shut my eyes
because you ask me to!

798
01:37:38,209 --> 01:37:41,656
So quit the job!
- I certainly will...

799
01:37:41,698 --> 01:37:43,662
but only after I've saved every
worker from your death-trap!

800
01:37:54,632 --> 01:37:56,592
Get the lift going!

801
01:37:59,652 --> 01:38:02,700
Stop working!

802
01:38:03,109 --> 01:38:05,066
And get out! Go on!

803
01:38:06,796 --> 01:38:09,309
Go away! Stop work!

804
01:38:55,398 --> 01:38:56,362
My son...?

805
01:38:56,394 --> 01:38:58,322
How many people have been
working in there?

806
01:38:58,355 --> 01:39:01,044
We can ascertain that
from the manager's register.

807
01:39:01,618 --> 01:39:03,575
Let's go to the manager!

808
01:39:05,968 --> 01:39:08,327
what are you guys doing?

809
01:39:09,361 --> 01:39:13,147
Wait... calm down...
Don't create a confusion!

810
01:39:13,717 --> 01:39:18,792
What's the matter?
- Water has flooded the mines.

811
01:39:28,809 --> 01:39:30,359
Three are many workers
trapped in there!

812
01:39:34,893 --> 01:39:37,940
It means millions of tons
of coal will be wasted!

813
01:39:37,980 --> 01:39:41,000
If asked, tell the reporters there
were no more than 30 or 40 workers...

814
01:39:41,041 --> 01:39:43,658
in the mines, okay?
- Not done, Dhanraj Puri.

815
01:39:44,897 --> 01:39:47,481
Stop him, Saxena!
- How dare you come here!

816
01:39:47,525 --> 01:39:49,109
Anybody there...?

817
01:39:51,348 --> 01:39:53,566
Nobody can save you
from me today, you swine!

818
01:39:55,137 --> 01:39:56,757
Remember what I had said?

819
01:39:56,801 --> 01:39:59,584
If even a single worker dies...
I won't spare you!

820
01:39:59,621 --> 01:40:00,212
Do you remember?

821
01:40:01,783 --> 01:40:05,138
And 400 workers will fall prey
to your greed today.

822
01:40:05,574 --> 01:40:07,659
And you will die at my hands!

823
01:40:09,763 --> 01:40:13,449
I' ll do my best to save
each and every worker!

824
01:40:16,540 --> 01:40:19,164
Don't use your dirty tongue
to call them workers...

825
01:40:19,337 --> 01:40:23,052
because workers for you are mere
machines that extract coal!

826
01:40:25,088 --> 01:40:26,812
And those workers now
trapped in the mines...

827
01:40:27,845 --> 01:40:29,806
...they are not mere machines,
they are human beings!

828
01:40:31,238 --> 01:40:36,182
They are someone's sons,
brothers, husbands...

829
01:40:37,222 --> 01:40:38,807
Call their names
with respect!

830
01:40:43,105 --> 01:40:45,069
Call them by their names...

831
01:40:45,798 --> 01:40:47,883
Purshottam Lal, say it!

832
01:40:49,224 --> 01:40:50,741
Ram Singh... say it!

833
01:40:51,186 --> 01:40:52,205
Murli..

834
01:40:53,246 --> 01:40:54,797
Rehmat Ali...

835
01:40:54,839 --> 01:40:56,664
Manohar...

836
01:41:01,357 --> 01:41:04,143
These and many more of them are
in the jaws of death today...

837
01:41:04,184 --> 01:41:06,971
because of you, Dhanraj!

838
01:41:08,007 --> 01:41:10,295
I will go into those mines
to save them.

839
01:41:10,332 --> 01:41:12,152
And you will accompany me!

840
01:41:12,191 --> 01:41:14,844
No, I won't come with you!

841
01:41:14,883 --> 01:41:18,312
Leave me alone, please!
Please forgive me!

842
01:41:19,339 --> 01:41:22,958
Why? Do you love this
wretched life so much?

843
01:41:23,997 --> 01:41:26,953
Bloody coward! I feel like
killing you this instant!

844
01:41:27,984 --> 01:41:31,699
But the laws and judiciary
of this country await you!

845
01:41:32,739 --> 01:41:34,530
I' m eagerly looking forward
to the day,...

846
01:41:35,565 --> 01:41:37,351
...when scoundrels like you
are thrown in the cells!

847
01:41:42,476 --> 01:41:44,959
What happened?
What's the matter?

848
01:41:45,001 --> 01:41:46,659
An accident has taken
place in the mines.

849
01:41:46,698 --> 01:41:48,683
There are many people trapped
in there. God save them!

850
01:41:53,916 --> 01:41:57,701
Stop! Stop, I say!

851
01:42:06,413 --> 01:42:08,395
I' m going in those mines
to help those workers!

852
01:42:08,445 --> 01:42:10,095
Are you crazy?

853
01:42:10,136 --> 01:42:12,785
No one knows of the level
of the water inside.

854
01:42:12,825 --> 01:42:14,449
Do you want to die?

855
01:42:14,487 --> 01:42:17,445
I want to live. But not
the life of a coward.

856
01:42:32,576 --> 01:42:35,125
Wait, Vijay,...!

857
01:42:37,361 --> 01:42:39,820
You won't go alone.
I will accompany you, too!

858
01:43:08,080 --> 01:43:09,767
No workers have yet
reached the lift.

859
01:43:09,805 --> 01:43:11,860
It looks as if they' re all
trapped in the tunnel!

860
01:43:12,799 --> 01:43:14,626
You go that way,
l' ll go this way.

861
01:43:14,662 --> 01:43:16,950
I might not get this
opportunity again...

862
01:43:16,986 --> 01:43:18,642
but I want to tell you something.

863
01:43:18,683 --> 01:43:22,534
I've never considered anyone worthy
of praise, except for my own self.

864
01:43:22,569 --> 01:43:24,791
But hats off to you,
my friend!

865
01:43:30,284 --> 01:43:32,606
Water seems to be flowing
at a great speed. Let's go.

866
01:43:46,306 --> 01:43:50,693
Wait... can you hear that?

867
01:43:52,056 --> 01:43:53,950
Water seems to have
already flown in there.

868
01:43:54,981 --> 01:43:57,341
We can't take this route
and make it to the lift.

869
01:43:57,378 --> 01:43:59,632
We' ll have to take another route.
- There's no other route.

870
01:44:00,666 --> 01:44:02,458
We can reach the lift by taking
the second left-wing tunnel!

871
01:44:03,495 --> 01:44:05,953
If we do that, none
of us will survive.

872
01:44:05,989 --> 01:44:08,173
That tunnel is at a lower level!

873
01:44:08,212 --> 01:44:10,072
Water will first flood
that tunnel!

874
01:44:10,108 --> 01:44:11,730
The tunnel is at a
lower level, all right.

875
01:44:12,770 --> 01:44:14,458
But it's quite far from the direction
in which the water is coming!

876
01:44:14,665 --> 01:44:16,624
So the water will get there late.

877
01:44:17,656 --> 01:44:20,082
We' ll cross the tunnel before
the water begins to fill in.

878
01:44:21,013 --> 01:44:22,970
The route you' re taking...
- I will take this route!

879
01:44:23,003 --> 01:44:25,465
You' re talking nonsense!
Water has flooded the mines...

880
01:44:25,498 --> 01:44:27,894
and you want to take us
deeper into the mines!

881
01:44:27,928 --> 01:44:30,114
Just keep your mouth shut!
I' m the Engineer!

882
01:44:30,152 --> 01:44:32,705
I know which tunnel will fill first
and which is more dangerous!

883
01:44:32,748 --> 01:44:35,796
So take the route you wish!
Go ahead!

884
01:44:35,837 --> 01:44:39,061
We don't want to die!
You might be an engineer...

885
01:44:39,098 --> 01:44:41,386
but don't teach us! We've spent
a lifetime in these mines!

886
01:44:41,423 --> 01:44:42,716
Those of you who want to go
with him, can go ahead.

887
01:44:42,753 --> 01:44:45,505
And those who want to go
straight to the lift,...

888
01:44:45,542 --> 01:44:46,735
... come with me.

889
01:44:46,774 --> 01:44:50,491
Wait! You' re making a mistake!
Don't take that route!

890
01:44:50,531 --> 01:44:52,585
Who's asking you to come along?

891
01:44:52,626 --> 01:44:54,215
C' mon, guys!

892
01:44:54,655 --> 01:44:58,199
Wait... Wait, I say!

893
01:45:00,638 --> 01:45:02,691
We' ll leave with you, sir!

894
01:45:41,861 --> 01:45:43,842
Why has everybody gathered here?!

895
01:45:43,884 --> 01:45:45,711
Is this an accident or
are we having fun here?

896
01:45:46,212 --> 01:45:48,177
Tell everyone to go home!

897
01:45:50,271 --> 01:45:53,092
Let's run away, sir...
or we' ll get lynched!

898
01:45:54,126 --> 01:45:57,277
He's the one! The murderer!
Beat him up!

899
01:46:12,810 --> 01:46:15,133
Inspector!
Save me from this mob!

900
01:46:16,168 --> 01:46:18,125
Leave me alone...
Take her away!

901
01:46:20,288 --> 01:46:22,372
He has tortured us, sir...
He has tormented us no end!

902
01:46:22,415 --> 01:46:24,376
Let's go! Hurry up!

903
01:46:25,408 --> 01:46:28,330
Hang him, sir... hang him!

904
01:46:50,438 --> 01:46:52,198
Stop! This way is blocked!

905
01:46:52,666 --> 01:46:54,626
We' ll have to go from
another tunnel; let's return.

906
01:47:21,021 --> 01:47:25,965
We' re trapped from all sides!
We can't go out, Vijay!

907
01:47:40,017 --> 01:47:42,768
How many of them are
trapped inside?

908
01:47:42,805 --> 01:47:45,028
I don't know. Vijay and Mangal
have gone in there, too.

909
01:47:45,070 --> 01:47:47,788
God save them!

910
01:47:53,441 --> 01:47:58,385
Get me out of here!
I don't want to die!

911
01:47:58,429 --> 01:48:00,390
Shut up!

912
01:48:14,287 --> 01:48:16,251
There's water behind this wall.

913
01:48:16,284 --> 01:48:18,901
I' m going to break this wall;
fetch me a shovel!

914
01:48:19,939 --> 01:48:22,862
No, Vijay, we all will
get drowned!

915
01:48:22,895 --> 01:48:24,453
For sometime we' ll be
in the water, all right.

916
01:48:24,494 --> 01:48:26,421
But this is the only way out.

917
01:48:27,453 --> 01:48:29,108
The water will make
a way for itself.

918
01:48:29,146 --> 01:48:31,664
So get a firm grip and
get me the shovel.

919
01:48:34,265 --> 01:48:35,955
I' ll make way for
the water first...

920
01:48:36,230 --> 01:48:38,190
and the waters will then
make way for us.

921
01:48:38,688 --> 01:48:40,544
So hold one another firmly!

922
01:50:03,957 --> 01:50:06,381
Help! Help!

923
01:50:06,549 --> 01:50:08,839
Here, my boy... come here.

924
01:50:09,577 --> 01:50:11,728
I can't swim!
What am I going to do?!

925
01:50:13,264 --> 01:50:16,087
Wait till I get there.
Hang on!

926
01:50:37,465 --> 01:50:39,425
Come down now...
hold my hand.

927
01:50:39,593 --> 01:50:43,142
No, I can't swim,
l' ll drown!

928
01:51:03,162 --> 01:51:04,784
Go on, son,
climb up...

929
01:51:25,036 --> 01:51:26,791
See? You' re saved.
Now run along.

930
01:51:27,831 --> 01:51:29,518
How about you?
- Worry about yourself. Go on.

931
01:52:23,631 --> 01:52:27,643
Not more than four,
or else the lift will break!

932
01:52:43,645 --> 01:52:44,865
The lift has broken!

933
01:52:47,528 --> 01:52:50,508
What happens now?
Who' ll save us?

934
01:52:59,268 --> 01:53:01,778
Get aside!

935
01:53:10,002 --> 01:53:11,792
Reverse the truck!

936
01:53:44,743 --> 01:53:47,132
Make a queue... Wait!

937
01:53:52,159 --> 01:53:55,411
Only four of you, or else
the lift will break again!

938
01:54:10,406 --> 01:54:15,195
My leg is trapped under
the rock! It's very heavy.

939
01:54:22,507 --> 01:54:25,299
The water level is rising,
there's very little time!

940
01:54:25,337 --> 01:54:27,196
I won't be able to get out!
So go away!

941
01:54:28,228 --> 01:54:29,984
Leaving you here...?
No, sir..

942
01:54:30,022 --> 01:54:34,238
Don't talk nonsense! Go away!
- No, we won't leave you, sir.

943
01:54:35,274 --> 01:54:38,198
If you go out...

944
01:54:38,232 --> 01:54:40,159
you' ll perhaps bring
some help for me.

945
01:54:41,191 --> 01:54:43,911
Now leave! There's no point
in waiting here! Go on!

946
01:54:58,246 --> 01:55:00,501
You remember, boss,
what I had once asked?

947
01:55:00,537 --> 01:55:02,555
" Aren't you afraid you might
get trapped in the mines?"

948
01:55:02,602 --> 01:55:05,453
And remember what I had said?

949
01:55:06,490 --> 01:55:09,933
There's no place in the world
from where Mangal can't escape!

950
01:55:11,109 --> 01:55:13,068
don't worry, son...

951
01:55:14,100 --> 01:55:16,495
I' ll save you first and
then save myself. Come on!

952
01:55:19,984 --> 01:55:24,404
Careful, everyone!
Watch out everyone!

953
01:55:26,132 --> 01:55:27,691
That wall is about to collapse!
Look there!

954
01:55:30,786 --> 01:55:32,444
Come here and help him, Rajesh!

955
01:55:32,485 --> 01:55:35,963
I' ll stop the wall from breaking.
So run away everybody!

956
01:55:36,008 --> 01:55:38,093
Go away!

957
01:55:51,197 --> 01:55:55,122
But boss you...
- Don't worry about me! Run away!

958
01:56:45,155 --> 01:56:47,978
There are five of us.
And only four can go in the lift.

959
01:56:48,013 --> 01:56:50,163
One of us will have
to get down.

960
01:56:50,208 --> 01:56:52,169
You know me, my friend.
I have three small kids.

961
01:56:52,202 --> 01:56:54,182
Not me, please...
Please forgive me.

962
01:56:54,232 --> 01:56:56,913
Never mind.
We' ll decide it in a minute.

963
01:56:56,955 --> 01:56:59,778
I' ll distribute a card
to each one of us.

964
01:56:59,816 --> 01:57:01,107
The one who has the smallest card
will get down.

965
01:57:01,144 --> 01:57:02,970
All right! Perfectly okay!

966
01:57:03,006 --> 01:57:07,426
Here you are... and you.

967
01:57:12,449 --> 01:57:16,163
A King... An Ace... A Queen...

968
01:57:16,234 --> 01:57:17,030
And what do you have?

969
01:57:17,068 --> 01:57:20,317
A Three!
- Looks like You must wait here.

970
01:57:20,561 --> 01:57:24,105
No! He has cheated me.

971
01:57:24,150 --> 01:57:27,732
He's bound to have a bigger card!

972
01:57:27,771 --> 01:57:31,060
He has deliberately given
me a small card!

973
01:57:31,100 --> 01:57:34,381
Murli, my friend, Three is
not the smallest of cards.

974
01:57:34,416 --> 01:57:36,933
Two is. Look at this.

975
01:57:36,979 --> 01:57:40,457
Good bye, friends.

976
01:57:40,701 --> 01:57:44,351
Didn't you say, Murli,
that you'd win some day?

977
01:57:44,393 --> 01:57:46,083
So you win today.

978
01:57:49,112 --> 01:57:51,797
No, my friend,...
you have won even today!

979
01:58:18,566 --> 01:58:21,119
You' re still here?!
Leave immediately!

980
01:58:21,988 --> 01:58:24,449
I've come to take you!
- Saving me is impossible!

981
01:58:24,483 --> 01:58:28,166
My leg is trapped under the stone.
Go on. Save your life!

982
01:58:28,207 --> 01:58:32,458
I saved my life once, sir...
I now want to redeem my soul.

983
01:58:32,497 --> 01:58:34,515
Try to pull your leg out!

984
01:58:38,613 --> 01:58:41,125
It's useless trying!
Just go away.

985
01:58:43,168 --> 01:58:44,390
It is too heavy; you won't
be able to lift it.

986
01:58:45,326 --> 01:58:47,285
I've carried a heavier burden
on my heart, sir.

987
01:58:47,319 --> 01:58:49,542
How won't I carry this one?

988
01:58:51,577 --> 01:58:54,658
Try and pull your leg out.

989
02:00:43,841 --> 02:00:46,265
My friend is in trouble,
my Lord.

990
02:00:48,294 --> 02:00:52,646
O Almighty... save their lives.
This is my prayer, Lord.

991
02:00:59,161 --> 02:01:01,282
Blessed is the one...

992
02:01:01,326 --> 02:01:03,874
who sings glories
of the Lord!

993
02:01:43,145 --> 02:01:44,968
Where's Mangal?
- I haven't seen him.

994
02:01:47,332 --> 02:01:48,815
Have you seen Mangal?

995
02:01:48,860 --> 02:01:53,609
Yes, he has sacrificed his life
to save the others.

996
02:01:53,648 --> 02:01:55,370
No... this cannot be!

997
02:02:34,701 --> 02:02:36,287
Look who's here.

998
02:02:48,065 --> 02:02:49,548
How did you know l' m here?

999
02:02:49,599 --> 02:02:51,612
Sudha sent us a telegram.

1000
02:02:52,421 --> 02:02:53,389
Come here, dear.

1001
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:01,257
Thank God, you are safe!
