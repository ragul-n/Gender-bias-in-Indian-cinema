100
00:10:32,221 --> 00:10:35,772

Good sound, but there is a problem

110
00:11:15,032 --> 00:11:17,280
I had to think about it before
The problem of me

111
00:11:18,192 --> 00:11:21,875
I think this song needs it
It's the voice of a man who is a woman

112
00:11:22,336 --> 00:11:23,856
The voice of a woman is not suitable for this song

113
00:11:23,937 --> 00:11:25,129
Excuse me, you were very good

114
00:11:25,904 --> 00:11:29,775
Find a male reader
I think I'm fine

115
00:11:30,096 --> 00:11:34,060

00:11:36,782 --> 00:11:38,446

00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:25,330
Yea, he sinks, tell me

133

Asked if you're drooping or not?

144
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:55,362
Yea, I'm gonna bite it now
What is that

145
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:57,235
... that is

146
00:12:57,941 --> 00:12:59,261

149
00:13:03,271 --> 00:13:04,913
Why is it okay
Finally an opportunity

00:13:16,917 --> 00:13:18,729
"My heart is for you"

00:13:19,144 --> 00:13:20,769
"My heart is hungry for you"

157
00:13:20,949 --> 00:13:23,247

You die in my mind

364
00:28:56,585 --> 00:28:57,449
Mommy

365
00:28:57,794 --> 00:28:58,297
I'm coming

366
00:29:24,698 --> 00:29:26,714
Why did you get this?
What do you think

367
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:28,979
There is no mother, no

368
00:29:29,419 --> 00:29:33,571
You gazed at that wall
You're crazy, you're not kidding

369
00:29:34,852 --> 00:29:39,202
what are you saying? Baba died at age 38
Grandfather at thirty-five

370
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:42,308
Bob that crashed
! The ball is sucking in your face

371
00:29:43,034 --> 00:29:46,412
Thirty thousand people are stadiums
! The ball is right, you're on my face

372
00:29:46,843 --> 00:29:47,659
What's grandfather

373
00:29:48,002 --> 00:29:51,733
She is an accident! The bathroom was filled with buckets of water
.. and asked to empty his head

374
00:29:52,111 --> 00:29:53,246
He went away and lost his head

375
00:29:53,362 --> 00:29:55,074
! Mommy, who eats your bucket in your head

376
00:29:55,729 --> 00:29:57,208
Crazy! The bucket was iron

377
00:29:59,849 --> 00:30:02,904
Why are you laughing

378
00:30:03,633 --> 00:30:05,033
Cry Like you?

379
00:30:05,729 --> 00:30:07,128
You put all of this on my head

380
00:30:07,968 --> 00:30:10,527
Then I'll apologize, I said, or not?

381
00:30:17,126 --> 00:30:20,897
Sadeer, what's that?
You died at 37, say more

382
00:30:21,948 --> 00:30:24,353
!Oh God! He was a poor heart

383
00:30:24,801 --> 00:30:29,916
He was not a heart attack, his destiny was

384
00:30:30,895 --> 00:30:33,510
Thank you for me
The same thing happened

385
00:30:37,792 --> 00:30:40,063
I said, they're all crazy

386
00:30:43,558 --> 00:30:45,598
Yep, really

387
00:31:13,566 --> 00:31:16,942
Why do not you understand two?
See this, see this wall

388
00:31:17,839 --> 00:31:21,366
Are you writing on the wall?
Do you die Ella, erase her

389
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:23,391
By not clearing it, my appreciation will not change

390
00:31:23,449 --> 00:31:27,639
Aron, if you're only 2 minutes away
.. think you understand

391
00:31:27,951 --> 00:31:30,006
I think I'm two months old

392
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:33,310
If this is the last year of my life

393
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:35,829
The way i want you
I want to live, this mischief?

394
00:31:37,148 --> 00:31:38,076
I made a decision

395
00:31:39,349 --> 00:31:40,609
.. somehow you decided for yourself

396
00:31:40,709 --> 00:31:43,924
This is not your decision, you want to go, go

397
00:31:44,089 --> 00:31:44,961
I'm going to die

398
00:31:44,965 --> 00:31:45,878
How can you do that?

399
00:31:46,093 --> 00:31:49,247
Listen to this, you two travel together
It's all right

400
00:31:49,799 --> 00:31:54,032
you do not understand
.. you know you're right

401
00:31:56,925 --> 00:32:02,634
What do you know?
Think of your child

402
00:32:11,263 --> 00:32:12,887
What is Mommy?

403
00:32:14,237 --> 00:32:19,393
"We had a short period of joy"

404
00:32:20,570 --> 00:32:26,297
"And now an empty yard"

405
00:32:28,985 --> 00:32:34,913
"We had a short period of joy"

406
00:32:36,898 --> 00:32:41,617
"And now an empty yard"

407
00:32:44,514 --> 00:32:46,386
"Those dark nights"

408
00:32:47,242 --> 00:32:51,862
Elo, yes you call

409
00:32:52,022 --> 00:32:54,074
What are you home

410
00:32:54,247 --> 00:32:57,163
Is Vivan sighted?
Why is he crying

411
00:32:57,428 --> 00:33:00,070
Sorry i have to go
We will record another day

412
00:33:00,721 --> 00:33:01,392
In the middle of the recording

413
00:33:02,879 --> 00:33:03,679
what happened? How are you

414
00:33:04,335 --> 00:33:11,079
do not worry
Children at times like that

415
00:33:11,863 --> 00:33:16,641
I do not like that

416
00:33:16,919 --> 00:33:20,887
"I can not breathe out when you went."

417
00:33:21,759 --> 00:33:26,743
"If you die, you will not feel upset either."

418
00:33:26,984 --> 00:33:31,760
"If you die, you will not feel upset either."

419
00:33:32,287 --> 00:33:35,438
"We had a short period of joy"

420
00:33:35,605 --> 00:33:36,642
What are you doing?

421
00:33:36,811 --> 00:33:37,644
I'm taking a shower

422
00:33:38,245 --> 00:33:42,766
With water toilet
run

423
00:33:47,999 --> 00:33:49,999
"Moments do not pass"

424
00:33:50,535 --> 00:33:55,911
Here it is ... what a great tree
Wonderful God!

425
00:33:57,939 --> 00:34:01,594
Hello, why did you just sit down?
Why do not you attend the meetings?

426
00:34:02,295 --> 00:34:06,232
I must be careful about the vivan
In the middle of the night, you like a bicycle

427
00:34:07,119 --> 00:34:10,839
That's fine, you can be careful too
You can also attend meetings

428
00:34:11,439 --> 00:34:13,315
Do you have a computer?

429
00:34:14,224 --> 00:34:14,753
One

430
00:34:15,334 --> 00:34:17,198
Okay, come next Sunday next week

431
00:34:23,158 --> 00:34:25,453
Good, good?

432
00:34:26,404 --> 00:34:28,124
Yeah

433
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:32,172
..If you want to stay here please come to Vivan

434
00:34:32,916 --> 00:34:36,373
I'm fine, are you good?

435
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:40,913
I saw you better

436
00:34:43,412 --> 00:34:44,701
Let's boot

437
00:34:48,237 --> 00:34:55,141
I know this is my first one
..Will you be alone, somebody else

438
00:34:56,684 --> 00:34:57,915
Someone else will never go

439
00:35:00,006 --> 00:35:01,141
You do not have a Sunni

440
00:35:02,877 --> 00:35:06,045
What a guarantee she is
Do not you miss me one day?

441
00:35:09,021 --> 00:35:12,477
One who is never to be set
I'm throwing away

442
00:35:14,124 --> 00:35:17,437
Is not it Vivan? Do you give me alone?
Not -

443
00:35:18,716 --> 00:35:23,328
"Those dark nights"

444
00:35:23,875 --> 00:35:27,475
"Those dark days"

445
00:35:28,488 --> 00:35:33,296
"That's the silence in all ways"

446
00:35:34,153 --> 00:35:37,864
"It's lonely everywhere in every breath"

447
00:35:38,672 --> 00:35:43,577
"I can not breathe out when you went."

448
00:35:44,277 --> 00:35:48,484
"If you die, you will not feel upset either."

449
00:35:49,317 --> 00:35:54,157
"If you die, you will not feel upset either."

450
00:35:54,591 --> 00:36:00,250
"If you die, you will not feel upset either."

451
00:36:04,873 --> 00:36:07,657
Mr. Darwala, two years ago
Worker rights have risen

452
00:36:08,458 --> 00:36:10,154
It just carries you

453
00:36:10,577 --> 00:36:15,858
Okay, I'll give him his money

454
00:36:16,498 --> 00:36:21,161
Because of fifty rupees, I do not understand this whole story

455
00:36:21,644 --> 00:36:24,162
It's not about fifty rupees, it's a matter of principle

456
00:36:24,675 --> 00:36:26,657
You are right, you are the Bashinin

457
00:36:27,454 --> 00:36:34,270
Viva Wissa, who are these gestures
Have you taught you?

458
00:36:34,956 --> 00:36:39,796
Mommy does not do anything
I'm doing everyone

459
00:36:40,244 --> 00:36:44,829
Everybody shovel you well, do you swear?
I would not be here now

460
00:36:45,544 --> 00:36:48,081
You kept me
I fell to that

461
00:36:48,329 --> 00:36:50,446
But you fell, if I were not
And you would have been falling

462
00:36:51,685 --> 00:36:52,300

My fault, if it was injured
You're comfortable at home

471
00:37:14,795 --> 00:37:16,138
Where to talk about death and life

What's that good

475
00:37:22,637 --> 00:37:24,329

You went to the campus or not

479
00:37:32,238 --> 00:37:34,405
Yeah, but then it was different
Everything has changed now

Yeah, everything got better
How good is the teacher

I do not dump at all, let them all go away

483
00:37:47,155 --> 00:37:49,915
You'r right
Go in another 20 years

00:43:01,093 --> 00:43:03,632
"Hope you want me to love you"

541
00:43:04,084 --> 00:43:07,460
"But most of the time my mother is not my father"

542
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:15,557
"Even if I'm, the shadow of the mother does not bend."

543
00:43:16,490 --> 00:43:20,882
"Shadow of my mother forever you are my life"

544
00:43:21,395 --> 00:43:25,844
"Shadow of my mother"

545
00:43:26,390 --> 00:43:30,154
"Shadow of my mother"

546
00:43:30,571 --> 00:43:35,618
"Shadow of my mother"

547
00:43:36,019 --> 00:43:38,271
"Shadow of my mother"

548
00:44:20,393 --> 00:44:22,051
Elevator of ruins?

549
00:44:22,639 --> 00:44:23,476
Not

550
00:44:26,221 --> 00:44:27,053
Did you eat

551
00:44:27,553 --> 00:44:29,222
Have you brought the box

552
00:44:31,021 --> 00:44:35,485
What is your mommy more like?
Do I have a box?

553
00:44:37,445 --> 00:44:42,446
What do you like about you?
Do i call you?

554
00:44:43,533 --> 00:44:45,070
Another phone
Another box -

555
00:44:48,009 --> 00:44:52,633
See your cousin, Gothem?
No, I do not want -

556
00:44:53,085 --> 00:44:53,792
Two days passed

557
00:44:54,581 --> 00:44:55,352
Not

558
00:44:56,245 --> 00:44:57,221
It's two minutes

559
00:44:57,557 --> 00:45:00,062
I do not understand Uncle Gotteme

560
00:45:00,881 --> 00:45:02,378
I did not see it at all

561
00:45:02,754 --> 00:45:05,513
You were four years old when you went to your wedding
You've seen it before

562
00:45:07,654 --> 00:45:09,156
No, I was not four years old, I was two years old

563
00:45:10,292 --> 00:45:11,075
We laughed!

564
00:45:15,035 --> 00:45:21,139
Okay, but if you call him
He likes it

565
00:45:23,603 --> 00:45:28,204
We do not understand each other
What makes a phone look like me?

566
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:30,796
It makes a difference for me
hit

567
00:45:31,491 --> 00:45:32,075

What can i say to her

574
00:45:42,645 --> 00:45:47,321
So much so sorry
Because of the death of Uncle Gottem

575
00:45:47,965 --> 00:45:50,157
I'm not sorry
So why lie?

576
00:45:51,637 --> 00:45:56,142
You do not want to lie, Kenal

577

584
00:46:29,758 --> 00:46:30,839
No problem, I understand

585
00:46:31,934 --> 00:46:32,725
Really?

586
00:46:33,286 --> 00:46:38,606
You call me very much two days ago
! And many do not know what to say

587
00:46:40,391 --> 00:46:41,766
But you brought me to you

588
00:46:43,834 --> 00:46:48,741
We never saw each other
But we must see each other

589
00:46:49,885 --> 00:46:50,582
Are you on facebook

590
00:46:50,845 --> 00:46:53,730

594
00:47:10,716 --> 00:47:16,899
I became very lonely but all the while ringing
I feel good

595
00:47:20,076 --> 00:47:22,828
Thank you for calling
He helped a lot

596
00:47:23,899 --> 00:47:25,428
I do not know how to go without my father

597
00:47:27,244 --> 00:47:36,627
It's hard but you can
I could

598
00:47:38,241 --> 00:47:40,519
Be careful with you bye bye

Mom open your room in my room?
How many times do I tell you?

601
00:48:11,472 --> 00:48:13,857
(His flower looks like a poison)

602
00:48:16,012 --> 00:48:17,432
Why did you put the fennel on the box?

603
00:48:18,219 --> 00:48:19,756
Why do you interfere with my private privacy?

604
00:48:20,387 --> 00:48:24,178
Which privacy is it? You are your own privacy
Do not talk the whole day

605
00:48:24,604 --> 00:48:25,779
My night is just your head

606
00:48:26,755 --> 00:48:28,243
Mom, if you have any, send me a message

607
00:48:29,075 --> 00:48:31,243
I do not work, I also do not play the message

608
00:48:33,261 --> 00:48:36,460
If you do not give me time, I'll go to your university

00:48:36,752 --> 00:48:37,952

00:48:54,123 --> 00:48:55,289
Give me the phone, Mom, please

615
00:48:55,448 --> 00:48:58,273
See this smart phone
Your mother is not smarter

616
00:48:59,458 --> 00:49:00,259
I'm not very sure

617
00:49:05,274 --> 00:49:06,161

618
00:49:06,739 --> 00:49:07,183

624
00:49:28,358 --> 00:49:29,305
God forbid

625
00:49:34,362 --> 00:49:35,617
Hello, two tickets please

626
00:49:36,297 --> 00:49:39,919
Wah Goddess

627
00:49:56,473 --> 00:50:03,035
My son is going to have her hair
Tell him her mother is inside

628
00:50:03,777 --> 00:50:05,277
Today's kids are all the same

629
00:50:06,036 --> 00:50:08,044
Where do you like with your dad?
See your mother and your movie!

630
00:50:08,715 --> 00:50:13,239
Not my son, this is not
It's probably somewhere

631
00:50:14,768 --> 00:50:15,439
OK

632
00:50:19,011 --> 00:50:22,655
Vivan, Forfer hair

00:50:23,079 --> 00:50:24,399
Okay

634
00:50:51,744 --> 00:50:56,070
Why are you masturbating your mobile phone?
Listen to mommy

635
00:50:56,249 --> 00:50:57,873
Sorry aunt, it was my fault

636
00:50:58,933 --> 00:50:59,727
Not your fault

637
00:51:01,246 --> 00:51:02,966
Listen to mommy

638
00:51:03,414 --> 00:51:04,173
Bandra do you go

639
00:51:04,553 --> 00:51:06,393

Going out, take us, please

641
00:51:09,272 --> 00:51:11,379
Be it
Let's go

642
00:51:17,172 --> 00:51:17,901

643
00:51:19,231 --> 00:51:20,453

645
00:51:23,781 --> 00:51:26,497
Mom, wait
I have no reason

646
00:51:26,871 --> 00:51:28,504
Let it be

647
00:51:29,128 --> 00:51:30,081
Mommy

648
00:51:43,541 --> 00:51:47,293
Mom, sorry, I really got caught

649
00:51:48,173 --> 00:51:49,320
Listen to mommy

650
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:56,261
Mom, today ... sorry, come out

651
00:52:33,477 --> 00:52:34,644
You can do it!

652
00:52:39,645 --> 00:52:40,653
Why are you doing this song?

653
00:52:41,621 --> 00:52:43,564
How are you mommy It is not good?

654
00:52:47,395 --> 00:52:48,635
Viv, please

655
00:52:51,725 --> 00:52:54,579
Say more! It is not good?

656
00:52:55,972 --> 00:52:57,890
If you make it right, go ahead

657
00:53:08,201 --> 00:53:11,016
Need not be so much a game

658
00:53:12,116 --> 00:53:14,848
You apologize last night
There is no problem

659
00:53:16,817 --> 00:53:24,370
There is a problem, Mom
Listen, I love you

660
00:53:27,193 --> 00:53:30,968
How much did you know
You are a real artist, you know very much

661
00:53:31,424 --> 00:53:32,512
say again

662
00:53:33,287 --> 00:53:33,802
what?

663
00:53:33,873 --> 00:53:36,792
I love you, "you know"
The last time you said this?

664
00:53:38,692 --> 00:53:42,709
True, tell everyone except your mother
Just fight with me, okay

665
00:53:45,287 --> 00:53:47,175
I'm just fighting you, okay

666
00:53:47,598 --> 00:53:48,898
So I love you, you

667
00:53:59,168 --> 00:54:05,552
.. your whole life ... see all your life
This is

668
00:54:06,770 --> 00:54:10,843
This is me, you just scroll around it

669
00:54:11,745 --> 00:54:15,673
You make a packet of food
Follow me, what?

670
00:54:17,191 --> 00:54:18,841
Breaks down

671
00:54:19,235 --> 00:54:19,765
Mommy

672
00:54:19,834 --> 00:54:20,527
what do I do?

673
00:54:21,522 --> 00:54:23,391
You can not do anything other than me

674
00:54:23,775 --> 00:54:25,590
Most importantly, seek attention to music

675
00:54:27,247 --> 00:54:28,615
Complete your university

676
00:54:29,128 --> 00:54:32,463
Remember the children of the apartment of music
.. that's great to you

677
00:54:33,201 --> 00:54:34,875
Why did not you give me this idea before?

678
00:54:35,515 --> 00:54:36,639
..There are many kids

679
00:54:37,166 --> 00:54:38,574
I complete my school and college

680
00:54:38,983 --> 00:54:39,686
Oh good idea

681
00:54:39,817 --> 00:54:41,329
I am your university

682
00:54:41,688 --> 00:54:43,178
Very good, what?
Nine nights

683
00:54:43,844 --> 00:54:46,137
I did not mean that

684
00:54:46,649 --> 00:54:49,607
You're not worried about anything

685
00:54:49,794 --> 00:54:52,519
I'm talking to the school principal
You just fill out my form

686
00:54:53,058 --> 00:54:55,473
Mom, I did not mean, listen

687
00:54:58,339 --> 00:55:03,779
All the stuff I said
Let's put it in your box, what's up?

688
00:55:04,324 --> 00:55:06,088
Grandmother, you understand mom
.. my university

689
00:55:06,567 --> 00:55:07,298
You're looking for papers

690
00:55:07,482 --> 00:55:08,843
I'm coming
Make well -

691
00:55:09,611 --> 00:55:10,699
Unanchance

692
00:55:16,843 --> 00:55:21,000
Mom you high school last year
Standard 78 was 100%, right?

693
00:55:21,015 --> 00:55:22,221
Yeah ok

694
00:55:23,359 --> 00:55:24,247
Sixty two percent

695
00:55:25,215 --> 00:55:26,039
She is for guidance

696
00:55:26,295 --> 00:55:27,091
That's 52 percent

697
00:55:28,531 --> 00:55:30,127
Finally the truth was revealed

698
00:55:30,726 --> 00:55:31,939
All your life lied to me so

699
00:55:32,245 --> 00:55:33,838
The top down I can do

700
00:55:34,591 --> 00:55:38,477
You are the first math
Otherwise it will be 78 percent

701
00:55:39,005 --> 00:55:40,285
You've got your own root

702
00:55:40,893 --> 00:55:42,613
Why did you burn fire?

703
00:55:42,982 --> 00:55:44,137
You must be proud of me

704
00:55:44,347 --> 00:55:47,900
You know the Times newspaper interviewed me
My photo is going to be printed

705
00:55:48,165 --> 00:55:53,325
Please, my university is not
You work and pack food very well

706
00:55:54,541 --> 00:55:57,275
If you want to relax
Choose another university

707
00:55:57,964 --> 00:56:04,492
Ok, I'm not going to have a problem
I'm getting an old package and I'm going to die

708
00:56:04,911 --> 00:56:10,245
No, I do not mean it, just finish it
But another university

709
00:56:10,805 --> 00:56:13,676
If I'm going to go, I'll just go to your university
The decision is with you

710
00:56:14,767 --> 00:56:15,887
Mom, please

711
00:56:16,319 --> 00:56:18,201
There is no problem
Viv has no problem

712
00:56:18,687 --> 00:56:19,711
Okay

713
00:56:20,620 --> 00:56:23,056
Okay Really?

714
00:56:23,529 --> 00:56:25,912
You are my college
But he has a series of rules

715
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:27,433
Rules?

716
00:56:28,008 --> 00:56:29,937
Act 1: The food package is closed

717
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:34,113
Second law: You do not know why you are looking for me

718
00:56:34,668 --> 00:56:37,931
Third Law: You're in no class
You're not beside me, Helle

719
00:56:38,516 --> 00:56:40,124
Now listen to my rules

720
00:56:40,731 --> 00:56:42,675

Why are you moving this middle?

There is no problem

805
01:01:47,781 --> 01:01:51,125
No, you do not know
What trouble you are!

806
01:01:51,635 --> 01:01:55,725
What a disaster? I can not do it anymore
I call you, really, that's right, no

807
01:01:56,020 --> 01:01:58,394
It's not law, you can

What are you doing -

I do not say any more

810
01:02:03,486 --> 01:02:04,806
What does that mean?

811
01:02:05,582 --> 01:02:07,406
I have nothing at all, okay?

812
01:02:07,782 --> 01:02:11,950
Can I talk to this?
Well, I have a very immediate job with you

You were both together

820
01:02:47,774 --> 01:02:49,755
I do not like this

821
01:02:50,206 --> 01:02:51,207
Not your fault

822
01:02:52,351 --> 01:02:53,582
exactly

823
01:02:54,615 --> 01:02:55,854
It's not your fault

824
01:02:59,646 --> 01:03:01,998
You really think you are going to university
To study?

825
01:03:06,078 --> 01:03:07,918
No glasses can not see it at all

826

I have all my comrades

01:03:28,391 --> 01:03:30,447
I know, did you accept the request?

831
01:03:31,611 --> 01:03:32,738
Do you mean me

832
01:03:33,891 --> 01:03:35,162

01:03:53,404 --> 01:03:55,525
Are you embarrassed for your mother?

836
01:03:56,860 --> 01:04:00,563
Yeah, feel numb

837
01:04:11,221 --> 01:04:16,059
What is your mom signed up to?
Who are you in the classroom?

838
01:04:22,315 --> 01:04:23,242
She is

839
01:04:26,931 --> 01:04:30,852
Listen, you're your mommy
Have you signed

840
01:04:31,671 --> 01:04:32,916
Why are you asking me?
Ask your mother

841
01:04:33,096 --> 01:04:37,143
I'm not looking for a fight
I know you're making money

842
01:04:37,695 --> 01:04:38,629

843
01:04:38,810 --> 01:04:40,315

846
01:04:45,475 --> 01:04:47,312

Why are you looking for the whole college?
Where is my mom Where is my mom

850
01:05:01,285 --> 01:05:03,812
Alex was not, because he had been arguing
I'm worried about that

851
01:05:04,493 --> 01:05:08,900
I feel that way
Sin is not a fault

852
01:05:09,132 --> 01:05:12,451
What? Why did you sit here
We sat with comrades

853
01:05:13,315 --> 01:05:16,311
Not that you have a lot of work
You're all over your head

854
01:05:16,962 --> 01:05:19,258
Did you bring that box of food?

855
01:05:21,353 --> 01:05:29,284
Did you forget box?
Very bad; very bad

856
01:05:30,272 --> 01:05:31,940
Tell me what Nikita looks like?

None of them

859
01:05:37,066 --> 01:05:39,747
Really the answer is right, but why you need it
It was so thoughtful

860
01:05:40,574 --> 01:05:42,518
Sometimes you're out of the phone

861
01:05:44,205 --> 01:05:45,780
If my boyfriend was
Beats a lot

862
01:05:47,054 --> 01:05:51,471

New model, no?

867
01:06:07,718 --> 01:06:08,718
Not aunt, online

868
01:06:12,170 --> 01:06:12,874
Are you bombay

869
01:06:13,658 --> 01:06:14,279
Yes

870
01:06:15,010 --> 01:06:16,658
Surely with your parents

871
01:06:17,499 --> 01:06:19,762
Hi how are you good

872
01:07:09,293 --> 01:07:11,116
What's up Lonely, I got back home again

873
01:07:14,645 --> 01:07:17,462
Mom is exactly going to university
That was all over again

874
01:07:19,449 --> 01:07:20,715
You do not need to be alone

875
01:07:23,503 --> 01:07:26,488
.. How many people are you in the university
Meet new people, love you

876
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:30,616
It's not easy to find a friend

877
01:07:34,961 --> 01:07:36,680
.. you were a little bit and you were going to play

878
01:07:37,696 --> 01:07:40,983
That's when you said it
No one plays with me

879
01:07:42,344 --> 01:07:49,377
Because nobody is my age
I am not someone of my age

880
01:07:52,835 --> 01:07:54,672
I do not know why I went to university

881
01:08:05,061 --> 01:08:11,200
Mom, take part in campus activities

882
01:08:12,844 --> 01:08:13,459
What?

883
01:08:13,639 --> 01:08:16,158
You are a college general
.. like the cultural group and

884
01:08:16,516 --> 01:08:20,622
Choose a group to your taste
And get started

885
01:08:23,479 --> 01:08:24,775
Tomorrow

886
01:08:27,159 --> 01:08:28,238
thank you

887
01:08:35,599 --> 01:08:37,847
See, see, see the card
I got all the groups

888
01:08:38,555 --> 01:08:46,014
But Debit's Debit Card is not here
Why is that so -

889
01:08:46,680 --> 01:08:48,505
Mom, be mad! He's having fun with you

890
01:08:50,684 --> 01:08:53,838
I know that he's joking
I know

891
01:08:54,480 --> 01:08:56,816
You do not need to register them all

892
01:08:57,415 --> 01:09:00,936
Mommy do what you do
You are interested in it

893
01:09:01,534 --> 01:09:03,200
As I chose the theater group

894
01:09:03,360 --> 01:09:04,671
You also choose the music group

895
01:09:04,818 --> 01:09:05,506
..this

896
01:09:09,100 --> 01:09:10,718
Theater group but you do not give it

897
01:09:11,330 --> 01:09:13,298
Okay, but I do not like her

898
01:09:13,736 --> 01:09:15,692
I know you do not like
But I'll say a clear time

899
01:09:16,034 --> 01:09:17,580
Mom does not choose theater group

900
01:09:20,657 --> 01:09:22,536
Now, I say, what time does it begin?

901
01:09:23,918 --> 01:09:26,873
Mom of theater group no
you're welcome

902
01:09:28,136 --> 01:09:33,697
Kite threads are cut
The rope of wishes should be tightened

903
01:09:34,671 --> 01:09:35,700
Did you take this test?

904
01:09:36,178 --> 01:09:38,465
Excuse me, you test that you're good to be cuddled

905
01:09:39,094 --> 01:09:40,698
Is this the song that has been read and accepted?

906
01:09:42,250 --> 01:09:50,074
.. we all have the courage ... all of us

907
01:09:51,059 --> 01:09:52,133
out

908
01:09:53,018 --> 01:09:54,300
!How rough
Next -

909
01:09:55,096 --> 01:09:55,633
Just

910
01:09:56,355 --> 01:09:58,106
Just be honest, do something fun

911
01:09:58,755 --> 01:10:03,522
Present? Let's go

912
01:10:04,262 --> 01:10:08,174
Kite threads are cut
The rope of wishes should be tightened

913
01:10:08,736 --> 01:10:10,560
.. We have the courage ... all of us

914
01:10:12,034 --> 01:10:14,912
Excuse me, this rhythm is slower

915
01:10:15,176 --> 01:10:16,431
Your rhythm is not a sink

916
01:10:16,812 --> 01:10:18,592
Mommy, that rhythm is down
I'm up I'm eating

917
01:10:18,926 --> 01:10:20,041
Get up

918
01:10:20,555 --> 01:10:21,260
Show me
Give -

919
01:10:28,594 --> 01:10:29,850
out

920
01:10:30,221 --> 01:10:37,773
Kite threads are cut
The rope of wishes should be tightened

921
01:10:46,053 --> 01:10:46,861
Shut up

922
01:10:51,631 --> 01:10:53,678
I'll kill you

923
01:10:55,396 --> 01:10:56,135
Next

924
01:10:56,399 --> 01:10:59,083
Kite threads are cut
The rope of wishes should be tightened

925
01:11:17,005 --> 01:11:21,943
This is very good
I can give it the original reader

926
01:11:23,677 --> 01:11:24,951
What do you do

927
01:11:25,719 --> 01:11:26,916
I came to pack

928
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:29,064
For inter-university competitions
They are testing

929
01:11:30,087 --> 01:11:31,344
I do not like that

930
01:11:31,956 --> 01:11:33,918
Somebody

931
01:11:35,197 --> 01:11:36,931
Mom What do you do?

932
01:11:37,134 --> 01:11:37,763
He's having slippers

933
01:11:37,863 --> 01:11:40,364
I said a few times in the middle of my test
Do not you let the teacher say?

934
01:11:41,314 --> 01:11:43,032
He is not a teacher

935
01:11:43,713 --> 01:11:45,409
Oh, the parents are not allowed either

936
01:11:45,849 --> 01:11:48,714
I am a student of ILA NOW
17th grade

937
01:11:49,357 --> 01:11:52,760
Oh, you're the newspaper about you
I was bloody

938
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:55,080
You can not throw the slippers the same way

939
01:11:55,608 --> 01:11:58,239
Here is my money, I do whatever I want
You're your own job

940
01:11:58,473 --> 01:12:00,243
I'm my job
My son is here

941
01:12:00,774 --> 01:12:04,035
Whoever wants to test can go
If you do not want a bad test, go out

942
01:12:04,956 --> 01:12:06,997
If I try to dare to throw it out
I will not have you

943
01:12:07,517 --> 01:12:08,921
Ooh ... see!

944
01:12:11,034 --> 01:12:12,126
I do not like it

945
01:12:13,014 --> 01:12:13,833
..This is your dish

946
01:12:17,572 --> 01:12:18,956
Come back

947
01:12:22,859 --> 01:12:23,739
So much?

948
01:12:26,279 --> 01:12:28,056
Go back to your guitar

949
01:12:30,238 --> 01:12:35,053
Have a question, leave the song

950
01:12:47,223 --> 01:12:51,127
Where is control?

951
01:12:52,293 --> 01:12:52,891
Was found

952
01:12:54,131 --> 01:12:56,731
Turn on

953
01:12:58,997 --> 01:13:07,299
See this Remix version of the Rockstar Rockstar
Be careful

954
01:13:08,108 --> 01:13:11,557
Be very careful about your answer
You have to answer this question

955
01:13:12,284 --> 01:13:15,814
The question is that the reader of the RIMEX version of the song
Who is Rok Rok?

956
01:13:16,339 --> 01:13:17,076
I

957
01:13:17,451 --> 01:13:24,539
One: Alka Yagnik Two: Osha Otp
Three: Elliotorker or four: Ela Aaron

958
01:13:25,523 --> 01:13:28,691
If you win, you will win twenty five million

959
01:13:30,324 --> 01:13:31,271
Twenty five million

960
01:13:37,919 --> 01:13:38,423
Mommy

961
01:13:38,655 --> 01:13:40,014
You know that you are famous!

962
01:13:42,208 --> 01:13:46,290
Yeah, this question, which is about five thousand
Twenty five million? How much is your question?

963
01:13:46,938 --> 01:13:47,923
You look so distressed

964
01:13:48,796 --> 01:13:50,300
Are you bored?

965
01:13:51,211 --> 01:13:56,275
Hard! Every child knows the answer
Three ILA Rotorker

966
01:13:57,218 --> 01:13:57,871
Yeah

967
01:13:58,178 --> 01:14:01,955
Well, 49% of the audience said
One: alka yagnik

968
01:14:02,536 --> 01:14:04,463
And 21% saying: Osha Utop

969
01:14:05,102 --> 01:14:06,214
.. and 7% telling the game keeper

970
01:14:06,393 --> 01:14:08,100
And 7% ila checkorker?

971
01:14:08,757 --> 01:14:14,258
Do not look at me, I can not help you

972
01:14:15,212 --> 01:14:19,787
In my opinion, there is an alka jaegic
The viewers also approve, option one

973
01:14:20,654 --> 01:14:22,421
The highest percentage is the option

974
01:14:23,051 --> 01:14:26,123
Do not do this, you can

975
01:14:27,218 --> 01:14:29,929
The computer is an Alka Ignik option

976
01:14:33,252 --> 01:14:37,596
Your answer is totally wrong

977
01:14:42,156 --> 01:14:43,233
Twenty-five million lost

978
01:14:43,833 --> 01:14:48,482
The right answer is the answer to the three-player version of the game

979
01:14:50,081 --> 01:14:51,034
Have you heard

980
01:14:51,515 --> 01:14:58,119
Ela Rajtorker This song is over
It has a very good sound

981
01:14:58,580 --> 01:15:03,711
Mom heard Amitab Bachchan
Called me three times?

982
01:15:05,315 --> 01:15:06,540
Call the visitor

983
01:15:07,547 --> 01:15:08,339
I'll ring

984
01:15:17,093 --> 01:15:19,314
Hi vivo Do you know what?

985
01:15:37,430 --> 01:15:38,430
Illa khanum

986
01:15:38,993 --> 01:15:42,037
Is it your birthday? say

987
01:15:43,128 --> 01:15:47,535
Good morning, I see I'm right
The main point

988
01:15:47,903 --> 01:15:48,496
Very good too

989
01:15:49,579 --> 01:15:51,811
.. I need a reader for my presentation

990
01:15:52,077 --> 01:15:53,336
Can you throw a slippers on his side?

991
01:15:54,042 --> 01:15:57,431
I just throw the slippers on the side
That's not my job

992
01:15:58,413 --> 01:15:59,842
I have no interest in your work

993
01:16:00,751 --> 01:16:03,032
Listen, that's what
I do not know for you, I promise

994
01:16:04,170 --> 01:16:06,320
You are on the side of Vivan, who is my son
You've thrown your slippers

995
01:16:06,780 --> 01:16:08,595
I do not want to work with you

996
01:16:09,380 --> 01:16:11,190
I could not have been if I wanted to

997
01:16:11,626 --> 01:16:15,922
Because I promised to Vivan
It does not go wherever I go

998
01:16:17,754 --> 01:16:20,724
Okay, I'll get out of the show

999
01:16:21,602 --> 01:16:22,202
What?
Overshadowed -

1000
01:16:23,277 --> 01:16:25,511
No, no podma, my mother's son

1001
01:16:29,046 --> 01:16:30,702
Vivan
Yes my mom -

1002
01:16:30,860 --> 01:16:31,816
You are not in this show

1003
01:16:31,902 --> 01:16:32,760
Why?

1004
01:16:33,326 --> 01:16:34,550
Ask your mother

1005
01:16:35,164 --> 01:16:35,752
Miss

1006
01:16:36,298 --> 01:16:39,987
Viivo does not want to worry
I'm so delighted

1007
01:16:40,607 --> 01:16:42,787
All right

1008
01:16:44,612 --> 01:16:46,332
That's wrong
This woman is telling the force

1009
01:16:46,756 --> 01:16:47,352
I do not force

1010
01:16:48,048 --> 01:16:49,816
He does not have to show his face

1011
01:16:50,275 --> 01:16:51,463
Show me, I make a decision

1012
01:16:52,246 --> 01:16:53,983
I do not want to participate in this show

1013
01:16:54,593 --> 01:16:56,400
He also can not force me to do this

1014
01:16:56,452 --> 01:16:58,974
He can not force me too
To do what I should not do

1015
01:16:59,022 --> 01:17:00,913
Sir, I will not bring you back

1016
01:17:01,681 --> 01:17:03,021
That's wrong
that's right -

1017
01:17:03,262 --> 01:17:04,102
Wrong

1018
01:17:04,272 --> 01:17:05,018
it's true

1019
01:17:05,218 --> 01:17:05,761
Wrong

1020
01:17:05,828 --> 01:17:06,848
A minute

1021
01:17:15,626 --> 01:17:18,624
This is not a theater, a prestigious university

1022
01:17:19,969 --> 01:17:22,329
We see that we are the Academy
Sport of power

1023
01:17:23,607 --> 01:17:27,336
If the classroom is strong
It benefits the general university

1024
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,684
Please understand
Why do not you understand

1025
01:17:33,474 --> 01:17:33,995
sorry

1026
01:17:39,555 --> 01:17:41,812
Now, tell me, it's your job
Do not you do right?

1027
01:17:42,060 --> 01:17:43,113
She is trying very hard

1028
01:17:44,420 --> 01:17:50,023
That's fine, but if you're a member of the show
Boiler options are very good

1029
01:17:50,204 --> 01:17:51,872
Unfortunately, you can not join this show

1030
01:17:53,204 --> 01:17:56,572
Okay, why do not you want to attend?

1031
01:17:59,450 --> 01:18:03,081
Because I promised to Vivan
Wherever it goes, I'm soft

1032
01:18:07,058 --> 01:18:08,233
Is he really the best choice?

1033
01:18:10,022 --> 01:18:13,475
She is wonderful
Thankful -

1034
01:18:17,363 --> 01:18:19,979
If I justify Vivan
Do you see the show?

1035
01:18:20,732 --> 01:18:24,684
.. I want to, because of the university

1036
01:18:24,871 --> 01:18:26,882
Accept precisely for the university

1037
01:18:30,782 --> 01:18:33,645
You're back in the air
I talk to her

1038
01:18:34,278 --> 01:18:35,373
This is my last point, all

1039
01:18:42,166 --> 01:18:45,838
What problem do you have with Vivan?
Why do not you run the show?

1040
01:18:46,286 --> 01:18:48,469
See me with my mother
.. Because you constantly fight with your mother -

1041
01:18:48,564 --> 01:18:52,292
I want you both
You both your mother

1042
01:18:53,094 --> 01:18:56,171
No, I made my decision

1043
01:18:57,237 --> 01:19:00,416
You do that for the university
Do you know, thanks

1044
01:19:02,611 --> 01:19:05,197
You see, it's not your mother's fault
you're welcome

1045
01:19:05,404 --> 01:19:09,633
You do not interfere, you're in the house
There is a great fight

1046
01:19:20,355 --> 01:19:22,378
I have to get ahead of you at the same time
.. when that

1047
01:19:22,504 --> 01:19:23,351
Ilaa

1048
01:19:28,522 --> 01:19:30,058
You changed this room completely

1049
01:19:36,531 --> 01:19:40,481
How big have you been!

1050
01:19:42,602 --> 01:19:44,986
Come on here

1051
01:19:48,738 --> 01:19:52,451
I'm alive, forty years
I'm going to go

1052
01:19:58,198 --> 01:20:00,166
Do it the same thing ten years ago

1053
01:20:15,878 --> 01:20:17,046
What's next?

1054
01:20:21,974 --> 01:20:23,114
Where were you all this time?

1055
01:20:24,882 --> 01:20:32,535
I was astray
I wanted to go back but failed

1056
01:20:34,698 --> 01:20:37,181
Then I got used to myself alone

1057
01:20:44,548 --> 01:20:45,537
We do the same

1058
01:21:00,164 --> 01:21:01,436
Do you need him?

1059
01:21:10,293 --> 01:21:11,636
what about you?

1060
01:21:33,372 --> 01:21:36,357
This is my diary

1061
01:21:40,295 --> 01:21:41,436
Sorry arun

1062
01:21:44,511 --> 01:21:47,813
I beg your pardon

1063
01:21:48,902 --> 01:21:50,158
Listen to your mother

1064
01:21:51,159 --> 01:22:05,159
: Intagram and the official telegram of our media
@BollyCineOfficial

1065
01:22:14,478 --> 01:22:16,598
Ella, I want you today
Call you

1066
01:22:17,422 --> 01:22:18,734
Mom Aaron

1067
01:22:19,151 --> 01:22:19,902
leave him

1068
01:22:20,214 --> 01:22:21,914
Aaron is alive

1069
01:22:22,455 --> 01:22:23,686
Did you live

1070
01:22:25,542 --> 01:22:26,674
Aaron is alive

1071
01:22:28,017 --> 01:22:28,689
Aaron

1072
01:22:33,433 --> 01:22:35,008
It was here

1073
01:22:36,761 --> 01:22:41,616
Was it? You made two slips

1074
01:22:46,049 --> 01:22:46,986
I got it

1075
01:22:49,153 --> 01:22:54,054
Did you make it You did it well

1076
01:22:54,755 --> 01:22:57,894
He does not want to stop at any moment
Whenever he wants to go

1077
01:23:01,035 --> 01:23:01,960
She is fine

1078
01:23:03,953 --> 01:23:04,761
Was happy

1079
01:23:05,963 --> 01:23:06,770
!maybe

1080
01:23:56,378 --> 01:23:58,353
Say something to Mom?

1081
01:24:01,111 --> 01:24:05,671
.. You always feared that after 40 years of age

1082
01:24:11,139 --> 01:24:13,072
I do not do anything Mommy

1083
01:24:20,756 --> 01:24:22,523
But when he came to Baba, there was a good deal

1084
01:24:24,994 --> 01:24:26,052
What?

1085
01:24:27,718 --> 01:24:28,654
Fear disappeared

1086
01:24:48,040 --> 01:24:48,840
say

1087
01:24:49,318 --> 01:24:49,987
Elo

1088
01:24:50,330 --> 01:24:51,074
Hey
Yes Mom -

1089
01:24:51,490 --> 01:24:53,819
You have a fridge
Eat a heater

1090
01:24:54,387 --> 01:24:55,179
Ok mommy

1091
01:24:57,397 --> 01:24:58,218
Elo

1092
01:24:58,538 --> 01:24:59,802
say

1093
01:25:00,090 --> 01:25:02,933
I got a chance, I got into trouble

1094
01:25:03,477 --> 01:25:04,752
What do you hurt?

1095
01:25:05,997 --> 01:25:06,919
Yesterday I saw Austa

1096
01:25:07,519 --> 01:25:07,924
OK

1097
01:25:08,117 --> 01:25:09,406
I asked for coffee

1098
01:25:09,886 --> 01:25:12,471
You know, it's been two years old that we've cut
.. I said because of your old age

1099
01:25:12,927 --> 01:25:15,773
Well, then. Diety does not upset
Daddy do not worry

1100
01:25:17,578 --> 01:25:18,778
I wish it was just there

1101
01:25:20,714 --> 01:25:24,877
We talked about each other together
Then I got it off

1102
01:25:25,379 --> 01:25:27,739
What ? You'r right?

1103
01:25:28,395 --> 01:25:34,234
If you understand that I've kissed Austa
All that's over, really forgive me

1104
01:25:35,397 --> 01:25:36,602
Why do you apologize to me?

1105
01:25:36,999 --> 01:25:40,013
I thought if I apologized for the phone
Feeling less guilty

1106
01:25:40,202 --> 01:25:41,843
Go get some sorry

1107
01:25:42,411 --> 01:25:46,011
My data is coming
What were you in my place? What were you doing?

1108
01:25:46,517 --> 01:25:50,557
I would never be your place
You're going to tell him the truth

1109
01:25:51,058 --> 01:25:53,153
This will annoy you later

1110
01:25:53,978 --> 01:25:55,330
I think, then I call

1111
01:25:58,891 --> 01:26:01,299
You said right
This will annoy you later

1112
01:26:03,299 --> 01:26:04,922
Why are you saying me?
Do you listen to the phone?

1113
01:26:05,991 --> 01:26:07,927
What's that I always
I'm listening to your phone

1114
01:26:08,423 --> 01:26:10,302
Why always say to me
You listen to the phone, okay?

1115
01:26:10,561 --> 01:26:14,112
Why do you give me
I understand that if so

1116
01:26:14,564 --> 01:26:17,060
Do you see this
For privacy, privacy

1117
01:26:17,484 --> 01:26:19,979
Which privacy is it?
I changed my clothes, remember you?

1118
01:26:20,390 --> 01:26:23,611
And after that, you are living and dithi
What are they going to do? They do not care about me

1119
01:26:23,615 --> 01:26:27,496
Listen to Mom, forget it
Do not talk to anyone at all

1120
01:26:28,064 --> 01:26:33,823
How ridiculous, let me go
Clean up your room

1121
01:26:42,692 --> 01:26:43,460
Hi, what's up

1122
01:26:43,991 --> 01:26:47,379
nothing

1123
01:26:48,769 --> 01:26:49,930
Why are you so depressed

1124
01:26:50,739 --> 01:27:00,043
I do not know, I'm strangely surprised last week
It is not clear what you are going to do?

1125
01:27:01,485 --> 01:27:02,399
!what happened

1126
01:27:02,661 --> 01:27:03,711
Nothing says ok

1127
01:27:06,742 --> 01:27:09,743
Aunt just a few minutes

1128
01:27:14,048 --> 01:27:14,983
.. you heard

1129
01:27:15,680 --> 01:27:16,535
.. I had that

1130
01:27:17,004 --> 01:27:20,735
I'm sure he
Everything says to Vivan

1131
01:27:21,008 --> 01:27:24,738
, And Vivan is also for you
Did not you say anything to you?

1132
01:27:25,795 --> 01:27:28,951
I do not know, I'm sure no news

1133
01:27:29,737 --> 01:27:30,995
Yea, daddy, you're worried

1134
01:27:32,041 --> 01:27:35,858
I do not feel so good
I know him well

1135
01:27:36,403 --> 01:27:39,178
What is the benefit of this relationship?
When I can not be right together

1136
01:27:40,246 --> 01:27:43,218
True, relationships must be firm

1137
01:27:43,922 --> 01:27:47,130
How can you say it
Sharing together

1138
01:27:48,081 --> 01:27:51,612
It does not matter
He's gonna kill me

1139
01:27:54,283 --> 01:27:56,451
Maybe you're bombarding her with telling you

1140
01:27:57,067 --> 01:28:02,780
He must be sure of that
That you really do

1141
01:28:03,631 --> 01:28:04,366
Forgiveness?

1142
01:28:05,362 --> 01:28:10,566
Forgiving for what?
Do you know anything

1143
01:28:11,448 --> 01:28:16,032
You know, Diety, she's poor
It was also very guilty

1144
01:28:16,536 --> 01:28:17,471
I'm sorry, Dati

1145
01:28:17,893 --> 01:28:20,894
What sorry do you Aunt said
Otherwise, you would not open the mouth

1146
01:28:33,474 --> 01:28:35,036
Diety Waysa, where are you going

1147
01:28:35,483 --> 01:28:36,715
Sorry really
Well Baba -

1148
01:28:54,054 --> 01:28:55,897
for what? Why?

1149
01:28:56,193 --> 01:28:58,851
See you, I did not want to
Talk with Dati

1150
01:28:59,394 --> 01:29:00,408
I told you

1151
01:29:01,384 --> 01:29:04,664
I would not say that at the time
It would be much more ruined

1152
01:29:05,016 --> 01:29:08,844
For two minutes silent
Silent, you ruined everything

1153
01:29:09,431 --> 01:29:15,237
Nothing is corrupted
You will be all right for two days

1154
01:29:15,899 --> 01:29:21,956
You really think what you did
That's right, is not it fair?

1155
01:29:23,007 --> 01:29:27,876
This is not true at all
Look, look at me

1156
01:29:30,302 --> 01:29:34,441
I do not want this stupidity
I'm not with you, I'm coming from here

1157
01:29:37,271 --> 01:29:38,129
You're angry
You can do whatever you want

1158
01:29:38,295 --> 01:29:39,596
I'm angry I'm telling you right

1159
01:29:44,806 --> 01:29:45,761
sick of you

1160
01:29:59,778 --> 01:30:00,517
Vive

1161
01:30:02,609 --> 01:30:03,409
Vive

1162
01:30:14,973 --> 01:30:16,082
What are you kidding

1163
01:30:16,778 --> 01:30:18,237
Did you see you

1164
01:30:18,591 --> 01:30:19,407
Just gone now

1165
01:30:19,929 --> 01:30:21,593
Did not say anything
No, I did not say where it goes -

1166
01:31:14,084 --> 01:31:14,938
Hello aunt

1167
01:31:15,530 --> 01:31:18,610
Elow, Nikita, have you come to you?

1168
01:31:19,018 --> 01:31:20,355
Not! how come?

1169
01:31:21,890 --> 01:31:23,138
He went

1170
01:31:24,481 --> 01:31:25,362
What's going on?

1171
01:31:26,318 --> 01:31:27,410
She went home and went home

1172
01:31:30,113 --> 01:31:33,058
If she's coming, tell her to call me

1173
01:31:33,890 --> 01:31:36,219
Ok do not worry
I'm doing it

1174
01:31:41,400 --> 01:31:42,311

1175
01:31:42,832 --> 01:31:43,920
Have you gone and gone

1176
01:31:44,513 --> 01:31:45,720
Wow! What does that mean?

1177
01:31:45,976 --> 01:31:47,375
God forbid! I do not understand

1178
01:32:04,679 --> 01:32:06,263
Ah! You

1179
01:32:07,715 --> 01:32:08,557
Have you come here

1180
01:32:09,526 --> 01:32:10,582
No what?

1181
01:32:11,102 --> 01:32:13,862
Did you go Who will let this go?

1182
01:32:14,406 --> 01:32:16,078
What did you go about?
You come

1183
01:32:17,231 --> 01:32:20,751
No, I'm going to follow her
It's not clear where the night is

1184
01:32:21,174 --> 01:32:24,963
No, your aunt takes you home
Maybe gone home

1185
01:32:26,663 --> 01:32:28,432
Okay, maybe

01:32:45,135 --> 01:32:46,832

01:33:15,521 --> 01:33:17,593
You're right now, did you understand?

1197
01:33:29,337 --> 01:33:34,147
Vivan, your diva

1198
01:33:34,938 --> 01:33:38,233

01:33:40,644 --> 01:33:41,852
sorry
Well Baba -

1200
01:33:45,492 --> 01:33:46,376
Did you talk with Dati?

1201
01:33:47,736 --> 01:33:52,361
No, it's time one
But everything is fine

1202
01:33:53,735 --> 01:33:56,736
But it was good, dear
Because I did not have the courage to say it

1203
01:34:01,798 --> 01:34:06,880
That's right, but mommy should not go
She told her

1204
01:34:08,279 --> 01:34:10,407
But he's really sorry for his work

1205
01:34:15,294 --> 01:34:16,766
Vivan, you have to go home

1206
01:34:19,206 --> 01:34:20,494
I'm coming back

1207
01:34:25,489 --> 01:34:26,797
Call it at least

1208
01:34:34,714 --> 01:34:36,362
It's a dish meal!

1209
01:34:38,053 --> 01:34:39,840
After talking to you
Your mother rang

1210
01:34:40,593 --> 01:34:42,340
God's servant came to put a stop here

1211
01:34:44,203 --> 01:34:46,497
She worries about you

1212
01:34:48,609 --> 01:34:49,642
She never knows

1213
01:34:49,850 --> 01:34:54,184
what ?
Listen to Vivan, listen

1214
01:34:54,744 --> 01:34:55,515
Do not interfere

1215
01:34:55,784 --> 01:34:59,506
Do not say anything, Vivan, listen to Vivan

1216
01:35:09,014 --> 01:35:10,774
How are you alo viso

1217
01:35:11,182 --> 01:35:15,806
I called Nikita for three hours
I got home

1218
01:35:16,302 --> 01:35:16,926
Why did you go

1219
01:35:17,967 --> 01:35:18,867
I was looking for you

1220
01:35:19,388 --> 01:35:20,862
.. you are my son, you are my life

1221
01:35:20,962 --> 01:35:24,848
Our problem is exactly the same
That is your whole life

1222
01:35:26,003 --> 01:35:27,180
Well then

1223
01:35:28,980 --> 01:35:31,430
What's up then
Right? -

1224
01:35:32,130 --> 01:35:36,070
Ilea; Ila Ritterker
You just became my mother

1225
01:35:36,618 --> 01:35:43,570
Where is it that writes, to laugh
And made music video?

1226
01:35:43,767 --> 01:35:46,322
Vivan, Come home

1227
01:35:46,835 --> 01:35:49,594
You always ask that
Why do not I say I love you?

1228
01:35:52,079 --> 01:35:55,731
I love you mommy
I love you

1229
01:35:57,402 --> 01:35:58,900
I'm not home for the same

1230
01:35:59,599 --> 01:36:00,439
Do not say so

1231
01:36:00,615 --> 01:36:04,247
I'm home for a few days
To think about it

1232
01:36:04,486 --> 01:36:06,421
I do not need to think
Need, listen -

1233
01:36:06,912 --> 01:36:08,453
You need one time

1234
01:36:16,731 --> 01:36:21,115
I spend a few days at home
Go go find it

1235
01:36:22,445 --> 01:36:26,238
Not for me, for your own sake

1236
01:36:28,252 --> 01:36:34,132
Until you found it
You do not see you

1237
01:36:34,604 --> 01:36:38,765
Please do not say this, please

1238
01:36:39,021 --> 01:36:42,564
See you, get another go
You were out all night. Listen

1239
01:37:20,515 --> 01:37:23,273
I could not sleep all night

1240
01:37:23,588 --> 01:37:26,041
I am all the laws that
I'll accept you

1241
01:37:26,297 --> 01:37:35,912
I'm not talking to friends, I'm not following you
Box, too ... just come home

1242
01:38:04,072 --> 01:38:07,746
Hey what's up

1243
01:38:08,522 --> 01:38:09,924

1244
01:38:11,022 --> 01:38:11,759
read

1245
01:38:25,493 --> 01:38:34,132
OK, okay, you're late
I'm all smiling

1246
01:38:35,353 --> 01:38:38,052
My mom did not continue this show

1247
01:38:40,966 --> 01:38:42,886
what did you say? Say one louder

1248
01:38:43,206 --> 01:38:44,798
Mrs., I did not continue this show

1249
01:38:45,373 --> 01:38:46,084
Why?

1250
01:38:47,066 --> 01:38:47,802
Private issues

1251
01:38:51,442 --> 01:38:54,563
Private issues?
Ok you can go

1252
01:38:59,104 --> 01:39:03,602
Do you want to give me
Because we do not have time for this game

1253
01:39:06,442 --> 01:39:08,423
No, I will not give up

1254
01:39:11,296 --> 01:39:18,208
All are enough for today
Thanks, everyone is coming home

1255
01:39:19,543 --> 01:39:20,823
These two make me crazy

1256
01:40:37,538 --> 01:40:38,371
thank you

1257
01:40:39,186 --> 01:40:39,899
For you

1258
01:40:40,646 --> 01:40:41,467
.. do not show my show

1259
01:40:47,075 --> 01:40:48,699
Vivan is a bit of a mess, no?

1260
01:40:50,308 --> 01:40:52,316
Beautifully gone to his mother

1261
01:40:55,419 --> 01:41:03,875
Just let that boy know
He loves you too much

1262
01:41:05,658 --> 01:41:11,751
I know, but she needs me
But this does not understand

1263
01:41:12,243 --> 01:41:21,718
She knows all this
Come out of yourself and look at yourself

1264
01:41:24,502 --> 01:41:29,855
Spending the whole life is looking for something good
Like me all looking for my work

1265
01:41:31,287 --> 01:41:35,919
But if that's enough
That feeling numb is too much

1266
01:41:40,287 --> 01:41:44,871
I was there
I threw something, I shot

1267
01:41:47,496 --> 01:41:53,967
You just throw away but you can not
Well done, you're fine

1268
01:41:57,378 --> 01:42:05,225
You're right to read and
Run another position

1269
01:42:05,936 --> 01:42:11,912
It will start another week

I'm going to be back today
To run out to everyone

1304
01:45:57,263 --> 01:46:04,942
This is all here, but you are not
I'm doing something for myself

1305
01:46:08,518 --> 01:46:16,326
You're not going to finish
Come on, I really love you

1306

I have a problem with my wife
We can not run

1313
01:47:27,750 --> 01:47:28,315
What?

1314
01:47:28,958 --> 01:47:29,984
Age limitation law

1315
01:47:30,280 --> 01:47:34,599
If a student is over 23 years of age
We all get out of the competition

1316
01:47:34,780 --> 01:47:36,738
I do not understand, tell me Arometer
I say-

1317
01:47:37,625 --> 01:47:39,963
If you are a group of students of their age
More than 23 years old

1318
01:47:40,423 --> 01:47:43,993
That group can not run
Leave this law up to date

1319
01:47:44,644 --> 01:47:47,487
No, I have to fix it

1320
01:47:50,581 --> 01:47:56,266
No, listen, you can not last the last minute
Change the law just as easily

Listen to this, Ella is officially a student

1322
01:47:59,534 --> 01:48:02,415
Try to understand, sir, we have our own reasons
We have to do this

1323
01:48:02,823 --> 01:48:04,047
The same happened two years ago

1324
01:48:04,475 --> 01:48:06,292
Some universities are professional artists
... you are enrolled in the university

1325
01:48:06,476 --> 01:48:07,724
So you can win the tournament

1326
01:48:07,877 --> 01:48:10,285
We did not do this
Do you think we are cheating?

1327
01:48:10,514 --> 01:48:14,373
What did you say did you cheat?
We talk of cheating? We say it's legal

1328
01:48:14,740 --> 01:48:16,566
What is the law Last night
For yourself?

1329
01:48:16,744 --> 01:48:17,846
Please do not talk like that

1330
01:48:18,298 --> 01:48:20,243
Sacrifice; you do something

1331
01:48:20,421 --> 01:48:22,275
We can not do without
We do this

1332
01:48:22,456 --> 01:48:25,053
We do not participate at all

1333
01:48:25,233 --> 01:48:27,901
If your name is your university name
Going to you black list

1334
01:48:28,053 --> 01:48:29,749
If you like this the last minute
Do not change the rules

1335
01:48:29,916 --> 01:48:32,236
Please, need to shout
And do not argue

1336
01:48:32,417 --> 01:48:33,815
There are no other benefits, we can not

You're practicing

No, it did not happen
Please try to understand

1343
01:48:54,104 --> 01:48:57,934
Poodma, you try to understand the university for five years
You can not attend any ceremony
