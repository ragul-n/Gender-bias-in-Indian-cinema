1
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:51,116
The Song of Apu

2
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:26,480
Let me see his face properly

3
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:38,553
What a little darling!

4
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:08,752
I am not in touch with Subir
all that much today.

5
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:12,628
But I think
the last time...

6
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:15,391
I met him was...

7
00:04:15,822 --> 00:04:19,258
...when a foreigner came to
take our photographs.

8
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:24,231
We had gone to Boral.
That's when I met him.

9
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:28,412
The entire thing
was organized by...

10
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:33,349
Mr. Nemai Ghosh,
Ray's still photographer.

11
00:04:34,173 --> 00:04:36,847
Filmmaker Bo Vanders
had come from Brussels

12
00:04:37,243 --> 00:04:39,519
...to make a
documentary on me.

13
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:43,117
They had "Pather Panchali's"
Apu and Durga in their script.

14
00:04:43,349 --> 00:04:46,819
They were looking for Apu.
I told them...

15
00:04:47,253 --> 00:04:51,633
...of his ancestral home near 'Wireless Park
(Kudghat Tollygunge).

16
00:04:52,225 --> 00:04:55,331
That is where he lives now.

17
00:04:55,528 --> 00:04:58,839
They did find him there.
And...This is Subir.

18
00:05:00,366 --> 00:05:03,609
He played good football. I don't
know why he didn't continue!

19
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:16,852
Dada(brother) is leaving for
Dhanbad tomorrow. He found a job.

20
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,824
Father is not very well either.

21
00:05:20,353 --> 00:05:23,630
How can I possibly leave
town to play a match?

22
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:28,204
You...

23
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,138
...give up too soon.

24
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:35,742
Once you're off, Sujoy and
Alok will get into the team.

25
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,840
What else can I do?

26
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:43,450
When you go,I can stay
over at your place.

27
00:05:46,245 --> 00:05:49,556
Moloy, you're making it
look like a World Cup match!

28
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,787
You're in form this season.

29
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:56,855
Manna says the Mohanbagan Club
will absorb you.

30
00:05:56,856 --> 00:06:00,702
Mohanbagan? Me??-
- I swear, he said so!

31
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:02,603
Never.

32
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:06,842
East Bengal Club.
lf l play at all.

33
00:06:07,266 --> 00:06:09,246
German Refugee Team?

34
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:13,411
You are the typical
Ghoti (orthodox townsman).

35
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,218
We're refugees.
So is our team.

36
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:18,453
We score 3 for 0 in
the league.

37
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:19,852
That's an accident.

38
00:06:20,179 --> 00:06:21,852
An accident, is it?

39
00:06:23,516 --> 00:06:26,326
Heard of anyone getting
allergies for eating Hilsa?

40
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:29,097
No.-
- Happens with prawns!

41
00:06:31,157 --> 00:06:32,101
Let's go.

42
00:06:38,831 --> 00:06:40,538
I've committed a blunder.

43
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:43,808
Should've asked Pram od to give
my proxy at attendance!

44
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:53,246
He's not very friendly with...

45
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:55,180
The opposite lane.

46
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:57,749
Third house on the right.
Second floor.

47
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,788
But he's a very cranky fellow.
Watch out!

48
00:07:02,121 --> 00:07:03,828
'Cranky', or short-tempered?

49
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:06,802
You'll know when
you see him. Go on.

50
00:07:21,841 --> 00:07:24,117
Why don't you say so?
Then I won't write my exam!

51
00:07:24,243 --> 00:07:27,247
That's not what I meant.
You always misunderstand.

52
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,851
I misunderstand?
Always?

53
00:07:30,149 --> 00:07:33,351
You keep interrupting my study.
And my exams are on Monday!

54
00:07:33,352 --> 00:07:37,494
You run out of turmeric, oil...
Can't you ask me to get them all at once?

55
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:43,340
I won't go out after this. -
- Fine, then I'll go.

56
00:07:43,663 --> 00:07:46,303
A young lad will sit
at home like a king...

57
00:07:46,365 --> 00:07:49,505
...and the old mother will
work like a slave!

58
00:07:50,369 --> 00:07:53,111
Now you're getting it wrong.
Did I say I won't go?

59
00:07:53,172 --> 00:07:54,651
Have I ever refused?

60
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:58,376
Your brother never shouted at me.

61
00:07:58,377 --> 00:08:00,254
Sure! He's your blue-eyed boy!

62
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,560
Who couldn't find a job in Calcutta!

63
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:05,720
Give me the match box.-
- Can't!!

64
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,731
Your father's run out of catechu.

65
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,131
Don't always compare me to Dada(brother)!
It irritates me!

66
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:47,696
Who is it?

67
00:09:48,854 --> 00:09:50,424
Is Mr. Subir Banerjee home?

68
00:09:52,858 --> 00:09:53,802
Yes?

69
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:01,942
Apu.. wake up...

70
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:17,721
What is it?

71
00:10:19,218 --> 00:10:21,220
Are you "Pather Panchali's" Apu?

72
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:22,890
No.

73
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:32,140
There's a letter for you.
It's important.

74
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:45,447
What letter?

75
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,522
Sir, I'm...

76
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:50,459
...from the Satyajit Ray Film
and Television Institute.

77
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:52,426
For Apu, of Pather Panchali...

78
00:10:52,551 --> 00:10:53,586
Listen my boy...

79
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:56,827
I have nothing to do with
either Satyajit Ray or Apu.

80
00:10:57,823 --> 00:11:00,133
Don't disturb me. Go.

81
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:08,137
Take it easy!

82
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:10,506
Careful!

83
00:12:12,765 --> 00:12:14,438
Make way, please!!

84
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:20,610
He fell down.

85
00:12:24,176 --> 00:12:26,850
Just met him this morning.
He was fine.

86
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:32,627
Careful! He's an aged man.

87
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:45,742
Mr. Banerjee!

88
00:12:46,565 --> 00:12:47,635
Can you hear me?

89
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:49,638
Open his socks.

90
00:12:50,169 --> 00:12:51,147
Yes.

91
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:54,546
Please move aside.

92
00:12:56,575 --> 00:12:59,249
Kanak has gone to get
Dr. Mitra.

93
00:12:59,345 --> 00:13:00,824
Are you in pain?

94
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,224
He had a black-out at
the rickshaw stand.

95
00:13:03,382 --> 00:13:04,656
Father!

96
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:08,298
Looks like it's a stroke.-
- A heart problem?

97
00:13:09,755 --> 00:13:12,497
Heart attack?-
- Everyone makes the same mistake.

98
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:14,859
A heart attack is different.
And a stroke...

99
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:17,136
Please keep quiet.
Let the doctor come.

100
00:13:17,263 --> 00:13:19,243
Please stand outside.-
- Sure, my boy.

101
00:13:19,865 --> 00:13:21,845
Prashanta, let's go outside.

102
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:25,346
Must be hurting
a lot?

103
00:13:29,441 --> 00:13:30,647
Bunty, open the windows.

104
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:31,448
Yes.

105
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:32,653
When?

106
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,356
Father? !

107
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:54,335
Sir...-
- Cut them smaller.

108
00:13:54,466 --> 00:13:55,444
Sure.

109
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:59,543
Throw the gills away.

110
00:14:00,739 --> 00:14:03,652
You don't understand the
gravity of the matter, Sir!

111
00:14:05,444 --> 00:14:08,220
They've sent you a
letter from Germany.

112
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,487
The Ministry sent it to SRFTI...

113
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:13,086
...so that they can locate Subir Banerjee...

114
00:14:13,452 --> 00:14:14,829
...and deliver this letter to him.

115
00:14:15,254 --> 00:14:17,856
There are thousands by
that name in Kolkata.

116
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:18,528
Done?

117
00:14:18,624 --> 00:14:20,297
The bag please.-
- Here.

118
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,231
No, this one is for you.

119
00:14:25,464 --> 00:14:27,273
This is your letter, sir!

120
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:29,142
The child actor, Apu,
in "Pather Panchali".

121
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:31,808
It is for Subir Banerjee, Sir.

122
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:35,614
The Dean has given me this
responsibility. Take a look...

123
00:14:35,674 --> 00:14:37,449
I'm not interested.

124
00:14:38,644 --> 00:14:41,215
I have no connection
with cinema now.

125
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:44,418
Tell them he couldn't be found.

126
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:52,553
'Tribal folk song'

127
00:15:08,474 --> 00:15:09,350
That's it.

128
00:15:10,876 --> 00:15:14,153
Very good. Slow down a little
more and then be steady.

129
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,418
Okay?

130
00:15:16,348 --> 00:15:19,090
You were very good. Just
don't look at the camera.

131
00:15:19,151 --> 00:15:21,722
Okay then?
Everyone ready?

132
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:24,132
Camera up!

133
00:15:25,624 --> 00:15:27,831
A little more. Up!-
- Silence everyone!

134
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:31,139
Start sound.

135
00:15:31,563 --> 00:15:32,234
Rolling.

136
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:34,440
Roll camera.-
-Rolling.

137
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:36,637
Clap!-
-2s/1, Take 1 u

138
00:15:36,735 --> 00:15:37,645
Action!

139
00:15:42,174 --> 00:15:43,152
Excuse me.

140
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:58,434
Hey cut it!

141
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:01,604
Is this a circus?
Take him away!

142
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:04,539
Can't you see a shoot's
going on! Get out!

143
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:06,607
Let go. I'll leave.-
- Yes, please do!

144
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:09,741
Crane up!-
- Silence!

145
00:16:09,868 --> 00:16:10,539
Out !

146
00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:12,340
Get out of here!

147
00:16:13,172 --> 00:16:14,310
Yes, I'm going!

148
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,511
Disturbing the shoot!-
- Silence!

149
00:16:44,536 --> 00:16:46,209
Give it to me.-
- Oh no, please.

150
00:16:46,538 --> 00:16:49,849
Don't refuse, give it to me.
Wouldn't I take it if you were my dad?

151
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:50,847
So?

152
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:54,514
Wait.

153
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:08,329
Listen...

154
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,816
I'm not going to
receive that letter.

155
00:17:25,677 --> 00:17:26,348
Fine.

156
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:30,655
The German Government's choice...

157
00:17:31,116 --> 00:17:33,351
...for the most celebrated
child character...

158
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:35,491
...is Apu.

159
00:17:35,754 --> 00:17:38,291
So they want to bring
the child actor over...

160
00:17:38,457 --> 00:17:39,731
...to felicitate him.

161
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:42,160
When Pather Panchali
turned fifty...

162
00:17:42,161 --> 00:17:44,835
...Pt. Ravi Shankar too
was felicitated by them.

163
00:17:46,865 --> 00:17:49,846
They want Subir
Banerjee in Germany.

164
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:53,546
You are 'Apu' to them,
Uncle.

165
00:17:57,543 --> 00:17:59,877
What do I have to do?-
-Nothing.

166
00:17:59,878 --> 00:18:03,223
Just read the letter and
give me a letter of consent.

167
00:18:03,649 --> 00:18:05,754
Uncle...
I'll take care of everything.

168
00:18:05,818 --> 00:18:08,697
You only need to sign
on your letter-head.

169
00:18:10,355 --> 00:18:12,426
You do have a letter-head?

170
00:18:13,659 --> 00:18:15,639
Never needed one in my job.

171
00:18:56,435 --> 00:18:58,540
Will you finish by today?-
- Yes.

172
00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:13,156
"The Bicycle Thieves" kid,
Enzi Satilla...

173
00:19:14,253 --> 00:19:16,824
He was a Maths teacher at
an ordinary school in Italy.

174
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:18,725
Retired a few years ago.

175
00:19:20,192 --> 00:19:23,537
Even he doesn't have any
connection with cinema now.

176
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:25,642
And the child in "E.T."

177
00:19:25,764 --> 00:19:28,711
He grew up to be a
guitarist in a band.

178
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:33,544
Then "Joy Baba Felunath’s"
Captain Spark. Jet Bose.

179
00:19:33,872 --> 00:19:35,749
Only one film.

180
00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:39,248
He's atop boss in a
huge Bengaluru hotel.

181
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:42,521
No one asks about them!

182
00:19:47,419 --> 00:19:49,831
The child in "The Kid".
Where is he?

183
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:51,626
Lost!

184
00:19:52,658 --> 00:19:54,433
You're not alone Uncle.

185
00:19:58,764 --> 00:20:00,607
Did cinema never attract you?

186
00:20:07,739 --> 00:20:09,514
For days Baba(Father)...

187
00:20:10,275 --> 00:20:11,845
...lay paralysed in bed.

188
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:15,620
Forget acting...

189
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:19,225
I never even felt like
watching films.

190
00:20:38,537 --> 00:20:42,144
This cannot go on, you know...

191
00:20:43,442 --> 00:20:45,615
There's a patient at home.

192
00:20:45,677 --> 00:20:47,850
Then there's housework.

193
00:20:50,782 --> 00:20:53,228
How's Aunt supposed to manage?

194
00:20:54,853 --> 00:20:56,230
Move aside.

195
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:04,140
Our relative...

196
00:21:07,332 --> 00:21:08,834
The girl's from Burdwan.

197
00:21:11,536 --> 00:21:14,210
Good girl... educated.

198
00:21:14,873 --> 00:21:16,648
She's from a village, but...

199
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:19,654
...she's from a respected
family. Well-groomed.

200
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,352
Are you listening?

201
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,195
Ashima.

202
00:21:26,351 --> 00:21:29,389
A Brahmin... though class divisions
don't matter to you...

203
00:21:34,826 --> 00:21:37,739
Should I get her
photograph and bio-data?

204
00:21:39,197 --> 00:21:40,437
Bio-data?

205
00:21:42,234 --> 00:21:44,180
A job indeed!

206
00:21:50,542 --> 00:21:52,522
Why don't you take a look
at the photograph?

207
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:56,820
Give it a try.

208
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:03,290
Bacchant Singh's hotel
on Rashbehari Avenue?

209
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:08,328
Bacchant Singh was a taxi-driver
back then.

210
00:22:09,227 --> 00:22:13,232
He was to take me to Boral
for the shoot everyday.

211
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,736
He always came on time.

212
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:19,214
After Kakababu's(Ray) work got over...
Do sit down...

213
00:22:20,572 --> 00:22:23,849
After the shoot, he would
drop me home on time.

214
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:27,757
Here.

215
00:22:33,552 --> 00:22:35,498
Later...

216
00:22:35,554 --> 00:22:38,626
Father would often
let me go alone.

217
00:22:39,424 --> 00:22:41,192
After all, Sardarji(Singh) was there!

218
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:43,230
A father figure...

219
00:22:43,662 --> 00:22:44,732
You'd go alone?

220
00:22:45,464 --> 00:22:47,341
Yes. Dada(brother) too was young.

221
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:52,204
Sometimes he'd visit
during vacations.

222
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:56,618
Four years of shooting!

223
00:22:58,276 --> 00:22:59,516
Four years!

224
00:23:01,179 --> 00:23:04,126
When money came, the
shoot would resume.

225
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:08,429
And when money got over,
the shoot was stopped.

226
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:14,534
Kakababu(Ray) took a lot of pains
to make the film.

227
00:23:17,362 --> 00:23:19,740
Even I barely got anything.

228
00:23:22,667 --> 00:23:23,805
But...

229
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:25,547
When Father...

230
00:23:26,204 --> 00:23:28,309
...visited sometimes, I saw...

231
00:23:28,473 --> 00:23:29,850
Kakababu(Ray)....

232
00:23:30,475 --> 00:23:33,149
...hand him a white envelope.

233
00:23:34,446 --> 00:23:36,858
I've held those envelopes
against the sun.

234
00:23:37,649 --> 00:23:40,220
There' d be a hundred
rupee note inside!

235
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:48,295
Why don't you read the
letter carefully to see...

236
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:50,697
...what exactly are
they giving me?

237
00:23:50,862 --> 00:23:51,704
As in?

238
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:55,337
See if they're giving
some money as well.

239
00:24:00,238 --> 00:24:00,739
Babe(son)!!

240
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:02,773
Come quickly!

241
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:04,185
Something's wrong with your father!

242
00:24:04,242 --> 00:24:05,721
The phone line is dead!

243
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:07,256
Call Dr. Dutta immediately!!

244
00:24:26,364 --> 00:24:28,173
Apu ... Apu ...Apu ...!

245
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:30,447
Apu get up!

246
00:24:30,869 --> 00:24:33,440
Get some water from
the river(Ganges). Here!

247
00:24:34,172 --> 00:24:36,243
Take the mug.
Get it quickly!

248
00:24:52,858 --> 00:24:55,668
New utensils for
old clothes!

249
00:25:04,769 --> 00:25:06,544
Apu ?

250
00:25:07,472 --> 00:25:09,315
He's on his way!

251
00:25:10,575 --> 00:25:12,555
Lord Shiva shall save us!

252
00:25:13,778 --> 00:25:15,815
Hail Lord Shiva!

253
00:26:00,458 --> 00:26:01,129
I'm sorry.

254
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:03,297
What happened?

255
00:26:04,262 --> 00:26:05,639
What's happened?!!

256
00:26:47,472 --> 00:26:49,816
Shambhu, finish it
and send it today.

257
00:26:49,874 --> 00:26:50,614
Okay.

258
00:26:54,679 --> 00:26:57,125
Meet me after work today.

259
00:26:57,248 --> 00:26:57,726
Okay.

260
00:27:01,653 --> 00:27:03,530
All okay?-
- Yes sir.

261
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:04,327
Good.

262
00:27:22,874 --> 00:27:24,854
Father's funeral is on the 12th.

263
00:27:25,276 --> 00:27:27,654
And then there's the
fast-breaking ceremony.

264
00:27:27,846 --> 00:27:30,452
It's not really an invitation...
Do come.

265
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:32,827
After everything is over, I...

266
00:27:33,351 --> 00:27:34,625
...say around the 17th...

267
00:27:34,719 --> 00:27:35,424
...shall join work again.

268
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:39,335
It's good to see...

269
00:27:39,457 --> 00:27:41,698
...that despite being a boy
of this generation...

270
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,502
...you are dutifully following
all traditional rituals.

271
00:27:45,196 --> 00:27:46,231
Will you be shaving your head?

272
00:27:48,566 --> 00:27:49,636
You're shaving your head, surely?

273
00:27:55,206 --> 00:27:56,514
Half-communist?

274
00:27:57,742 --> 00:27:59,244
Whose name is this?

275
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:01,846
Brother' s.

276
00:28:02,247 --> 00:28:04,227
He's performing all rituals.

277
00:28:04,649 --> 00:28:07,425
There's one other thing, Dulal Babe...

278
00:28:09,154 --> 00:28:11,395
This factory, the machines, the noise...

279
00:28:12,724 --> 00:28:14,601
This environment isn't for me.

280
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:16,636
Do give me some
other reponsibility.

281
00:28:16,728 --> 00:28:20,175
If there's a vacancy
in the Dharamtala office.

282
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:22,208
I could appear for all
necessary examinations.

283
00:28:22,333 --> 00:28:25,507
Finish your responsibilities
as a son before that.

284
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:27,447
How's your mother doing?

285
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:28,543
Fine.

286
00:28:29,441 --> 00:28:30,181
I must go.

287
00:28:31,276 --> 00:28:32,721
Long Live Revolution!

288
00:28:32,844 --> 00:28:34,653
Long Live Revolution!

289
00:28:47,625 --> 00:28:49,434
Hurry up!
Into the car!

290
00:28:58,837 --> 00:28:59,713
Come on!

291
00:28:59,771 --> 00:29:01,444
Revolution, huh?
Come on!

292
00:29:16,454 --> 00:29:17,592
Get into the car!!

293
00:30:01,833 --> 00:30:03,642
They'd often ask me
to join them.

294
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,813
'Subir, come when
you have some time.'

295
00:30:10,875 --> 00:30:13,253
'We need to talk...'

296
00:30:13,444 --> 00:30:14,479
About what?

297
00:30:14,546 --> 00:30:16,719
As always, brainwashing!

298
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:19,219
Over here?-

299
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:26,601
Jobless people.

300
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:28,829
Useless.

301
00:30:30,461 --> 00:30:32,498
And what came of the revolt?

302
00:30:34,866 --> 00:30:36,436
Most of them

303
00:30:37,268 --> 00:30:39,145
...took up meaty jobs abroad.

304
00:30:39,871 --> 00:30:41,509
Pocketing fat salaries.

305
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:47,153
That photograph of yours
at Nemai Ghosh's house...

306
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:50,660
It was natural that the
police suspected you.

307
00:30:51,616 --> 00:30:54,392
I never bothered
about the police.

308
00:30:54,819 --> 00:30:58,164
If I fell in front of them,
I'd tell myself...

309
00:30:58,223 --> 00:31:00,794
"I'm not into all this.
Why should I be scared?"

310
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:05,833
That's it.

311
00:31:06,564 --> 00:31:08,305
No more signatures.

312
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:22,456
Arko...

313
00:31:23,781 --> 00:31:25,692
You're doing so much to
send me to Germany...

314
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:29,164
What are you getting
out of it?

315
00:31:32,757 --> 00:31:33,735
Nothing.

316
00:31:34,859 --> 00:31:38,170
Telling myself that I'm
working for Pather Panchali.

317
00:31:38,663 --> 00:31:40,734
How many of us
get that chance?

318
00:31:46,371 --> 00:31:47,247
Oh..

319
00:31:48,206 --> 00:31:51,187
Uncle, do you have a
small photograph?

320
00:31:54,379 --> 00:31:55,187
Do you?

321
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:58,226
Open your eyes.

322
00:32:12,163 --> 00:32:13,540
How many copies?

323
00:32:14,365 --> 00:32:15,343
How many?

324
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:17,838
About ten.
And four for the VISA.

325
00:32:18,236 --> 00:32:20,147
Okay.-
- Why so many?

326
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:21,348
Keep them.

327
00:32:21,673 --> 00:32:23,744
Yes, keep them.
The rates are low.

328
00:32:23,841 --> 00:32:24,615
Oh.

329
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:26,756
When will you deliver them?-
- Since these are digital...

330
00:32:26,878 --> 00:32:29,358
You'll get them right away.
In ten minutes.

331
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:30,289
Oh!

332
00:32:44,429 --> 00:32:46,739
Don't you ever have
classes in SHRFTI?

333
00:32:47,832 --> 00:32:49,311
Of course.

334
00:32:50,768 --> 00:32:53,578
You are always around me...

335
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:56,642
Aren't you losing out
on studies?

336
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:00,645
There's still time Arko.

337
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:04,320
Let me be.

338
00:33:07,352 --> 00:33:08,422
I've aged.

339
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,596
I'm adjusted to a
certain lifestyle.

340
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:15,600
The crowds, the press, photographers...

341
00:33:16,861 --> 00:33:18,340
and this foreign trip.

342
00:33:24,469 --> 00:33:26,244
I'm feeling nervous.

343
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,187
Do you have a passport?

344
00:33:38,449 --> 00:33:39,182
Why?

345
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:39,684
I do.

346
00:33:41,753 --> 00:33:45,701
You bunk classes anyway.
A few more days won't matter.

347
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:50,729
They did say they'll give
me an escort!

348
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:00,443
The light.-
- Sorry.

349
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,540
The groom's arrived!
Come, see!

350
00:34:42,547 --> 00:34:43,355
Greetings!

351
00:34:44,348 --> 00:34:45,725
Welcome, Subir!

352
00:34:47,351 --> 00:34:48,386
Move aside.

353
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:22,594
[Chants] Om Swasti. Om Swasti.

354
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:24,321
Don't you have her
photograph?

355
00:36:24,549 --> 00:36:25,118
I Mean...

356
00:36:25,383 --> 00:36:27,158
Mrs. Ashima Banerjee's?

357
00:36:27,218 --> 00:36:28,094
No.

358
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:31,393
How much is the tailoring
charge for the suit?

359
00:36:31,489 --> 00:36:33,298
Along with the material...

360
00:36:33,624 --> 00:36:35,604
...about 6000.-
- God!

361
00:36:37,728 --> 00:36:39,765
I'll go bankrupt!

362
00:36:42,733 --> 00:36:43,711
Impossible.

363
00:36:45,736 --> 00:36:47,807
How cold will it be in
Germany?

364
00:36:48,339 --> 00:36:49,716
8 to 10 degrees(Celsius).

365
00:36:50,408 --> 00:36:52,615
I'll wear double sweaters.

366
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:53,814
Come in.

367
00:37:18,202 --> 00:37:18,873
Uncle...

368
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:21,717
Before you leave...

369
00:37:22,206 --> 00:37:24,311
...how about meeting
Satyajit Ray's family once?

370
00:37:25,209 --> 00:37:26,517
They'd be happy.

371
00:37:27,511 --> 00:37:28,489
No way.

372
00:37:29,513 --> 00:37:31,493
There's no need to overdo this.

373
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:37,327
If I were you...

374
00:37:37,388 --> 00:37:39,163
I'd have a press conference.

375
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:42,393
You're being given
such a coveted award.

376
00:37:43,127 --> 00:37:44,367
Shouldn't people know?

377
00:37:44,528 --> 00:37:45,802
Look...

378
00:37:46,297 --> 00:37:49,506
Are you going to come up
with new ideas everyday?

379
00:37:52,536 --> 00:37:56,211
Did the organizers
bother to inform them? No.

380
00:37:58,442 --> 00:37:59,785
Then why should I...

381
00:38:02,146 --> 00:38:02,715
Listen...

382
00:38:03,347 --> 00:38:07,090
If we can do this under
wraps, good. or else...

383
00:38:07,818 --> 00:38:08,796
Fine.

384
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,099
May I...

385
00:38:11,589 --> 00:38:14,263
...open the window please?
My eyes are smarting.

386
00:38:15,726 --> 00:38:18,468
I sprayed pesticides the other day.

387
00:38:20,231 --> 00:38:21,209
Open it.

388
00:38:24,602 --> 00:38:26,411
This room is never opened.

389
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:29,675
You insisted, so...

390
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,197
Which direction is this?

391
00:38:49,727 --> 00:38:50,705
South.

392
00:38:58,903 --> 00:39:01,782
Where are you lost?

393
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:08,517
Where have I seen
these drapes?

394
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:12,084
Try and remember.

395
00:39:17,121 --> 00:39:18,099
You know?

396
00:39:24,829 --> 00:39:27,366
Where? At Uncle's house?

397
00:39:27,832 --> 00:39:28,572
No.

398
00:39:31,435 --> 00:39:33,278
In this house itself.

399
00:39:37,408 --> 00:39:38,819
In this house?

400
00:39:42,313 --> 00:39:43,849
Yes my dear.
On me.

401
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:47,856
A sari from my wedding.
Don't you remember?

402
00:39:48,185 --> 00:39:52,395
It got stuck to a nail and tore.
So, I made curtains.

403
00:39:53,524 --> 00:39:55,470
Nice! Recycle.

404
00:39:56,494 --> 00:39:57,802
No!

405
00:39:58,329 --> 00:40:00,502
Not on a cycle! On a rickshaw!

406
00:40:07,438 --> 00:40:09,577
A rickshaw?-
- What's wrong with you!

407
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:12,120
The door's open !-
- Ma won't come now.

408
00:40:12,209 --> 00:40:13,813
What if someone else arrives?

409
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:18,159
I do want someone to arrive,
but no one seems to!

410
00:40:18,716 --> 00:40:21,492
It's time we offered prayers.

411
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:26,795
What?

412
00:40:28,125 --> 00:40:29,695
I forgot!-
_What?

413
00:40:30,494 --> 00:40:31,598
Move!

414
00:40:57,721 --> 00:40:58,699
What's that?

415
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:02,864
Father came on Wednesday.
He brought this.

416
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:05,300
A charm from
Goddess Kali's temple.

417
00:41:05,396 --> 00:41:06,340
Very effective.

418
00:41:06,397 --> 00:41:08,775
Nothing can touch you
if you wear it.

419
00:41:11,836 --> 00:41:13,213
Not even you?

420
00:41:14,438 --> 00:41:17,317
Go and bathe.
Then I can put this on you.

421
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:20,379
Your father...

422
00:41:20,711 --> 00:41:24,659
...put a charm on me.
That's effective too!

423
00:41:25,716 --> 00:41:27,286
Go bathe.

424
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:31,156
And yes...

425
00:41:31,222 --> 00:41:34,203
On the 28th you are specially
invited to our home.

426
00:41:34,291 --> 00:41:35,292
Don't forget.

427
00:41:39,597 --> 00:41:40,405
Go along.

428
00:42:34,585 --> 00:42:37,657
Why are you staring?
Am I your new bride?

429
00:42:46,797 --> 00:42:49,277
Only one.
You promised.

430
00:42:49,333 --> 00:42:52,405
After meals.

431
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:58,245
You missed my little boy's
rice-eating ceremony, so...

432
00:42:58,309 --> 00:43:00,186
Mother is a bit...

433
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:02,220
...Do explain to her.

434
00:43:03,747 --> 00:43:06,193
Is that why she didn't
send the car to the station?

435
00:43:06,383 --> 00:43:09,193
Mother's not like that.
Byangoma's not working.

436
00:43:09,687 --> 00:43:11,792
Who is 'Byangoma'??-
- The Austin car.

437
00:43:12,389 --> 00:43:14,767
He is 'the noisy fairy-tale bird'!
The clutch needs repair.

438
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:18,304
He's an old car...

439
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:21,876
You know, Byangoma had a wife!
Byangomi. The red car.

440
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:23,804
Chrysler.

441
00:43:24,301 --> 00:43:25,780
She stopped working
six years back.

442
00:43:26,403 --> 00:43:29,475
After we sold it,
Father didn't eat for two days.

443
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:35,413
Saying, " break my bones,
you'll sell me off as junk too!"

444
00:43:36,847 --> 00:43:37,621
Dada(Brother)...

445
00:43:38,215 --> 00:43:41,492
Father was saying, Tunu's
turned out to be very fair!

446
00:43:42,419 --> 00:43:43,557
Now
who's 'Tunu'?

447
00:43:44,421 --> 00:43:47,561
Brother's younger one.
Runu is older. Runu, Tunu.

448
00:43:48,525 --> 00:43:49,401
Oh.

449
00:43:50,694 --> 00:43:52,196
He's very naughty!

450
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:55,132
He's always running around!

451
00:43:55,199 --> 00:43:57,201
Always chattering away!

452
00:43:57,334 --> 00:43:59,314
And if you stop him,
he'll sing songs...

453
00:43:59,703 --> 00:44:00,704
...recite rhymes.

454
00:44:03,841 --> 00:44:05,752
Please don't hurry back
this time, Subir.

455
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:07,744
It's been long since you visited.

456
00:44:07,745 --> 00:44:08,689
Hey wait!

457
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:10,284
Stop here.

458
00:44:11,615 --> 00:44:12,753
What happened?

459
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:17,598
What is it?

460
00:44:25,129 --> 00:44:26,164
Come here.

461
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:36,181
What is it?

462
00:44:43,213 --> 00:44:43,816
Come with me.

463
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:56,103
What?-
- Shhhh!

464
00:44:56,427 --> 00:44:57,303
Listen !

465
00:45:37,534 --> 00:45:39,810
This is where
our house was.

466
00:45:41,338 --> 00:45:43,716
And this is the
cracked wall.

467
00:45:46,310 --> 00:45:48,312
This is all that's left.

468
00:46:04,561 --> 00:46:06,563
This is where our door was.

469
00:46:13,403 --> 00:46:14,381
Here.

470
00:46:15,706 --> 00:46:16,776
This tree.

471
00:46:17,641 --> 00:46:20,315
That scene where a raindrop falls
on that bald man's head?

472
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:22,321
With the rains approaching?-
- Yes!

473
00:46:22,412 --> 00:46:24,289
That scene was shot here.

474
00:46:24,481 --> 00:46:25,687
Under this very tree!

475
00:46:29,219 --> 00:46:30,289
Over here...

476
00:46:30,587 --> 00:46:33,090
...Bansi(Ray's Art Director)
had put up a cow-shed.

477
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:39,107
And this is that window!

478
00:46:39,530 --> 00:46:40,770
My sister dying"-

479
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:42,804
A roaring storm outside...

480
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,605
Jute curtains
fluttering in the wind.

481
00:47:02,886 --> 00:47:05,696
On this shelf was hidden,
the necklace that she had stolen.

482
00:47:07,624 --> 00:47:09,103
The tulsi shrine.

483
00:47:09,293 --> 00:47:13,105
Back then the shrine
seemed very high.

484
00:47:14,131 --> 00:47:16,202
This was Aunt's corner.

485
00:47:17,401 --> 00:47:19,108
Indir Thakuran's shack.

486
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:23,410
Kakababu(Ray) himself had
planted this hibiscus tree.

487
00:47:24,441 --> 00:47:26,216
The plant was tiny then!

488
00:47:27,344 --> 00:47:29,881
This is where Pishima(Aunt)
would wash her hands.

489
00:47:32,783 --> 00:47:35,491
Jatin!
Call your master immediately!

490
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:52,871
What's wrong, Jatin?-
- Sister's had a fall.

491
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:05,514
Jatin's gone to get the doctor.
Lives nearby, will reach soon.

492
00:48:05,515 --> 00:48:06,459
Okay.

493
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:12,394
What happened, my dear?-
-it was all so sudden!

494
00:48:12,689 --> 00:48:15,725
I was startled when I heard
the sound from downstairs!

495
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:17,672
Don't worry. She'll be fine.

496
00:48:19,830 --> 00:48:21,776
Move aside. Let me see.

497
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:26,510
What happened Kali?-
- What else?

498
00:48:27,237 --> 00:48:29,839
She's been travelling all day.

499
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:32,320
Probably exhaustion.

500
00:48:32,442 --> 00:48:33,386
So grandson-in-law?

501
00:48:33,443 --> 00:48:35,616
I've been noticing
for two years...

502
00:48:35,746 --> 00:48:38,249
You're not taking care
of Kali at all.

503
00:48:38,415 --> 00:48:39,860
Why else would she fall?

504
00:48:40,117 --> 00:48:41,596
You're at it again?

505
00:48:42,519 --> 00:48:44,499
Don't mind, Subir.

506
00:48:44,721 --> 00:48:47,201
Aunt is poking fun at you.

507
00:48:47,524 --> 00:48:49,470
A grandson-in-law after all!

508
00:48:49,626 --> 00:48:51,503
She can't resist teasing you.

509
00:48:54,598 --> 00:48:55,576
Not fever.

510
00:48:57,234 --> 00:48:59,305
I'm better now, Grandma.

511
00:48:59,503 --> 00:49:00,709
Quiet!

512
00:49:02,539 --> 00:49:03,574
Please come.

513
00:49:07,644 --> 00:49:08,588
Give me the bag.

514
00:49:08,645 --> 00:49:09,316
Sure.

515
00:49:12,516 --> 00:49:14,792
So, Aunt?
You're the doctor now?

516
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:18,793
My dear, open your mouth.
Let me give you a painkiller.

517
00:49:18,889 --> 00:49:21,096
In case you've hurt yourself.

518
00:49:21,425 --> 00:49:24,668
No, she did not fall.
The tea-tray fell.

519
00:49:25,195 --> 00:49:27,197
She grabbed the rails and sat down.

520
00:49:27,331 --> 00:49:28,309
Please come.

521
00:49:30,801 --> 00:49:32,576
What's wrong with our girl?

522
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:35,306
Is Calcutta not suiting her?

523
00:49:35,505 --> 00:49:37,280
Of course it is!

524
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:41,179
She's been fine in Calcutta-
- Aunt, let her go now.

525
00:49:41,244 --> 00:49:44,282
Doctor's here. Sit.-
- Let's see what's wrong.

526
00:49:45,315 --> 00:49:49,618
I don't know what you will say Upen,
but my diagnosis is...

527
00:49:49,619 --> 00:49:50,791
...Kali is pregnant.

528
00:49:50,887 --> 00:49:53,458
Oh Aunt!
Let him examine her!

529
00:49:55,625 --> 00:49:58,105
Upen, I've administered
some Arnica.

530
00:49:58,328 --> 00:49:59,306
Okay.

531
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:24,098
Uncle...

532
00:50:26,590 --> 00:50:28,661
Do you know
what this is?

533
00:50:31,728 --> 00:50:33,264
What is that?

534
00:50:34,664 --> 00:50:36,871
A brick from that house
in Boral.

535
00:50:38,802 --> 00:50:40,873
I picked it up quietly!

536
00:50:42,439 --> 00:50:44,214
What use is it of?

537
00:50:44,641 --> 00:50:47,121
This is history, Uncle!

538
00:50:47,444 --> 00:50:49,822
A brick from the house
in 'Pather Panchali'.

539
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:58,295
Did you bring some
hibiscus as well?

540
00:50:58,688 --> 00:50:59,393
No.

541
00:51:02,692 --> 00:51:04,365
Here. Try this.

542
00:51:05,629 --> 00:51:06,767
Turn around a little more.

543
00:51:12,736 --> 00:51:13,714
And then?

544
00:51:15,338 --> 00:51:16,874
Was Grandma right?

545
00:51:18,241 --> 00:51:19,618
Unbelievable power!

546
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:28,157
She had only checked
the pulse.

547
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:32,195
Then the inevitable happened...

548
00:51:32,422 --> 00:51:34,595
They kept their daughter back.

549
00:51:35,492 --> 00:51:36,800
An affluent family...

550
00:51:38,528 --> 00:51:39,802
They'd take good care of her...

551
00:51:40,297 --> 00:51:42,607
She'd be happy among
her own people.

552
00:51:44,301 --> 00:51:45,871
Here she had to work very hard.

553
00:51:46,136 --> 00:51:47,809
She had to manage everything alone.

554
00:51:48,305 --> 00:51:49,306
Good.

555
00:51:49,706 --> 00:51:50,582
Perfect fit!

556
00:51:54,244 --> 00:51:56,190
This one's last.
Try it once.

557
00:51:58,115 --> 00:52:00,254
That's enough.
Don't overdo it.

558
00:52:00,417 --> 00:52:01,657
Two is enough.

559
00:52:02,519 --> 00:52:04,499
You shouldn't have brought
these coats.

560
00:52:05,222 --> 00:52:08,465
What if your father needs them?

561
00:52:13,830 --> 00:52:15,707
He won't.

562
00:52:16,199 --> 00:52:17,371
2003.

563
00:52:17,534 --> 00:52:18,672
7th March.

564
00:52:19,903 --> 00:52:21,405
Cardiac arrest.

565
00:52:25,442 --> 00:52:26,420
Wear this.

566
00:52:27,344 --> 00:52:28,220
Turn around.

567
00:52:33,717 --> 00:52:34,787
Let me see.

568
00:52:38,321 --> 00:52:39,299
Perfect!

569
00:52:41,324 --> 00:52:42,769
And then?

570
00:52:43,126 --> 00:52:45,299
You left her back at her
father's?

571
00:52:50,133 --> 00:52:51,305
I'll leave.-
- God bless.

572
00:52:52,502 --> 00:52:53,674
I'll take your leave.-
- Yes, my son.

573
00:52:54,538 --> 00:52:55,710
Grandma, come inside.

574
00:52:59,342 --> 00:53:00,320
Bye then?

575
00:53:04,714 --> 00:53:06,159
Listen !

576
00:53:11,621 --> 00:53:15,501
Mother's right hand is hurting.
Please break the coal for her.

577
00:53:15,625 --> 00:53:18,105
Get her some fuel
too if you can.

578
00:53:18,195 --> 00:53:19,105
Okay.

579
00:53:19,296 --> 00:53:19,865
And...

580
00:53:20,130 --> 00:53:22,303
We owe the Waterman 3 rupees.

581
00:53:22,432 --> 00:53:24,673
He's very clever.
He'll ask for more.

582
00:53:24,734 --> 00:53:25,804
Don't you Pay!

583
00:53:27,737 --> 00:53:28,807
And listen...

584
00:53:29,706 --> 00:53:30,480
Cigarettes...

585
00:53:31,408 --> 00:53:32,478
Don't smoke too much!

586
00:53:35,345 --> 00:53:36,415
And yes!

587
00:53:38,114 --> 00:53:41,584
When you dry clothes on the
rooftop, turn them inside out.

588
00:53:41,718 --> 00:53:43,664
Or else they'll bleach.

589
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:44,858
Okay.

590
00:53:45,121 --> 00:53:46,191
See you then?

591
00:53:47,123 --> 00:53:47,794
See you.

592
00:53:58,235 --> 00:54:00,374
Won't you visit me sometimes?

593
00:54:00,637 --> 00:54:02,116
Why won't I?

594
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:06,312
Keya was saying
she knows a good cook.

595
00:54:06,443 --> 00:54:07,649
Try and engage her.

596
00:54:07,711 --> 00:54:09,384
Don't eat junk food.

597
00:54:10,313 --> 00:54:11,189
Subhash .-
Yes.

598
00:54:11,481 --> 00:54:13,085
Don't delay.

599
00:54:13,583 --> 00:54:15,563
It's time for the train.
You must leave.

600
00:54:16,119 --> 00:54:18,565
Seat him on the train
before you come away.

601
00:54:23,126 --> 00:54:25,106
Don't forget to give
Mother her sari.

602
00:54:25,195 --> 00:54:27,402
And water the
plants everyday.

603
00:55:33,430 --> 00:55:34,738
What's this?

604
00:55:35,165 --> 00:55:36,405
Only one?

605
00:55:36,766 --> 00:55:38,143
Don't you drink?

606
00:55:39,269 --> 00:55:40,748
Do you?

607
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:42,149
Yes.

608
00:55:43,173 --> 00:55:44,151
Sometimes.

609
00:55:44,674 --> 00:55:46,153
How old are you?

610
00:55:47,377 --> 00:55:48,617
26. Why'?

611
00:55:49,746 --> 00:55:51,191
Just asked.

612
00:55:57,454 --> 00:55:59,400
My friends even smoke herbs.

613
00:56:01,524 --> 00:56:02,628
I don't.

614
00:56:04,227 --> 00:56:05,729
Don't ever touch them!

615
00:56:06,329 --> 00:56:07,637
They'll destroy you.

616
00:56:09,666 --> 00:56:11,168
At your age, even I...

617
00:56:11,234 --> 00:56:12,611
succumbed to peer pressure...

618
00:56:13,236 --> 00:56:15,307
...specially during festivals...

619
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:16,908
...and tasted them.

620
00:56:17,574 --> 00:56:21,420
I think I saw about three hundred
bottles under the staircase.

621
00:56:23,413 --> 00:56:25,723
Yes, it's time to sell them.

622
00:56:29,252 --> 00:56:30,526
Did you mind?

623
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:33,825
At that time...

624
00:56:34,424 --> 00:56:36,426
I had left Ashima behind.

625
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:39,536
7-8 months.
I was alone.

626
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:43,802
Sudhanshu,
Benu, Moloy...

627
00:56:45,368 --> 00:56:47,609
...my friends, would
often come over.

628
00:56:48,872 --> 00:56:51,443
That was when I took to it.

629
00:57:01,551 --> 00:57:04,122
Leaving Ashima behind
may have been easy...

630
00:57:06,222 --> 00:57:09,294
but staying without her
was not easy at all.

631
00:57:13,463 --> 00:57:15,807
And think about my age
back then.

632
00:57:19,536 --> 00:57:22,608
What more?
That's all for today.

633
00:57:22,872 --> 00:57:25,409
And sorry for the
spelling mistakes.

634
00:57:25,475 --> 00:57:27,819
I know you'll laugh.

635
00:57:27,877 --> 00:57:30,380
Laugh if you like!
I'm not a writer, am I?

636
00:57:30,947 --> 00:57:33,427
This is good enough
for a letter.

637
00:57:33,550 --> 00:57:35,826
Take care of yourself,
my dearest.

638
00:57:36,352 --> 00:57:37,695
I am keeping well...

639
00:57:38,621 --> 00:57:41,124
...but I'll feel better
when you come.

640
00:57:41,224 --> 00:57:42,532
You will come, won't you?

641
00:57:42,826 --> 00:57:45,705
If you don't, you're not my friend.

642
00:58:05,548 --> 00:58:08,290
Arko, this is the last one.
You must go home.

643
00:58:11,621 --> 00:58:12,793
This is bad.

644
00:58:16,259 --> 00:58:17,237
Why bad?

645
00:58:21,164 --> 00:58:24,236
The world's most celebrated
child actor is Apu.

646
00:58:26,369 --> 00:58:28,349
You are that actor.

647
00:58:33,643 --> 00:58:35,816
No one knows...
That the man...

648
00:58:36,679 --> 00:58:37,646
...has taken a...

649
00:58:37,647 --> 00:58:39,388
...a forced retirement...

650
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:45,230
...lives on a meagre house rent
and pension now.

651
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:50,834
Is this not bad?

652
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:56,136
Go home, my child.
Do you know what time it is?

653
00:59:02,171 --> 00:59:03,149
Uncle...

654
00:59:05,475 --> 00:59:06,818
What if I don't go?

655
00:59:08,278 --> 00:59:09,848
I mean, do you mind if I...

656
00:59:10,747 --> 00:59:12,624
...stay here tonight?

657
00:59:13,816 --> 00:59:15,523
Your mother will worry.

658
00:59:17,754 --> 00:59:19,233
I'll call her.

659
00:59:21,858 --> 00:59:24,634
I often stay out
with friends.

660
00:59:25,428 --> 00:59:27,135
At their homes...

661
00:59:27,664 --> 00:59:28,836
the hostel.

662
00:59:30,733 --> 00:59:32,440
She is used to it.

663
00:59:33,436 --> 00:59:35,438
But it's okay... I mean...

664
00:59:37,340 --> 00:59:38,512
If you don't want me to stay...

665
00:59:38,575 --> 00:59:39,815
I'll leave.

666
00:59:45,615 --> 00:59:47,185
Did I say that?

667
00:59:51,821 --> 00:59:52,595
Thanks.

668
00:59:55,558 --> 00:59:57,196
I should call Mother.

669
01:00:03,666 --> 01:00:04,804
Irony sir.

670
01:00:09,872 --> 01:00:11,146
Irony.

671
01:00:18,848 --> 01:00:21,226
Father had dreams,
you know...

672
01:00:23,319 --> 01:00:24,821
...to go abroad.

673
01:00:26,856 --> 01:00:28,733
He couldn't make it.

674
01:00:35,865 --> 01:00:38,345
At least Father's outfits
are going abroad.

675
01:00:40,770 --> 01:00:42,249
And that too, to Germany.

676
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:52,221
Father used to say...

677
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:56,594
"Your work may not
reach a destination...

678
01:01:00,356 --> 01:01:01,801
But your intentions should."

679
01:01:26,215 --> 01:01:27,888
What do you think Moloy?

680
01:01:30,753 --> 01:01:32,232
I'm not very hopeful.

681
01:01:38,261 --> 01:01:40,502
What do you mean by that?

682
01:01:47,470 --> 01:01:51,247
Her father's also not
saying anything clearly.

683
01:01:56,546 --> 01:01:58,685
A premature baby...

684
01:02:00,817 --> 01:02:03,320
And there are
respiratory problems.

685
01:02:07,223 --> 01:02:09,225
Jaundice has set in too.

686
01:02:17,667 --> 01:02:18,737
Won't survive?

687
01:02:19,168 --> 01:02:21,341
We're doing our best.

688
01:02:26,175 --> 01:02:28,155
Thus, the incubator.

689
01:02:32,215 --> 01:02:32,716
Repeat.

690
01:02:45,561 --> 01:02:47,199
Listen... you...

691
01:02:47,663 --> 01:02:49,142
...be honest

692
01:02:49,665 --> 01:02:51,508
Do I need to worry
about Ashima?-

693
01:02:51,734 --> 01:02:54,237
No.
She's fine.

694
01:02:56,172 --> 01:02:57,515
Physically fine.

695
01:02:59,375 --> 01:03:01,719
But they are not
giving her the baby.

696
01:03:02,378 --> 01:03:04,722
Everyone's saying
the same thing.

697
01:03:08,551 --> 01:03:11,191
Should we shift her?

698
01:03:11,254 --> 01:03:13,131
To a better nursing home?

699
01:03:13,523 --> 01:03:15,230
That won't help.

700
01:03:15,858 --> 01:03:17,804
What do you mean?

701
01:03:21,564 --> 01:03:24,909
Dr. Dawn has told me clearly,
"I'm trying my best Moloy."

702
01:03:30,173 --> 01:03:31,846
Prepare yourself.

703
01:03:37,647 --> 01:03:39,422
What nonsense!

704
01:03:40,349 --> 01:03:41,327
Subir.

705
01:04:05,308 --> 01:04:12,522
Red Salute to the first Leftist
Government in West Bengal!

706
01:04:12,615 --> 01:04:15,824
Red Salute to the first Leftist
Government in West Bengal!

707
01:04:18,754 --> 01:04:20,392
Red Salute! Red Salute!

708
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:26,398
Red! Red!
Red Salute!

709
01:04:26,562 --> 01:04:28,235
Red Salute!
Red Salute!

710
01:05:00,663 --> 01:05:04,133
The people who conduct
the VISA interview...

711
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:07,509
...are they all Germans?

712
01:05:08,938 --> 01:05:11,350
How would I know?

713
01:05:11,741 --> 01:05:14,449
Why are you worked
up since morning?

714
01:05:14,577 --> 01:05:17,148
Are you going there of your
own will, on a holiday?

715
01:05:17,213 --> 01:05:18,453
They have called you.

716
01:05:18,514 --> 01:05:20,460
You're an invited guest!

717
01:05:20,516 --> 01:05:22,496
Have confidence!

718
01:05:22,618 --> 01:05:26,293
I've arranged all your documents.
You'll have no problem.

719
01:05:29,258 --> 01:05:34,298
[Interview in German]

720
01:05:37,366 --> 01:05:40,142
Do you know how they
say 'Good Morning'?

721
01:05:40,870 --> 01:05:42,247
'Gu-ten Mor-gen!'

722
01:05:46,776 --> 01:05:48,153
Gu-ten Mor-gen.

723
01:05:49,578 --> 01:05:51,216
Mr. Subir Banerjee.

724
01:05:54,450 --> 01:05:55,224
Come.

725
01:05:58,554 --> 01:06:01,831
And listen, don't need to say
'Gu-ten' and all that.

726
01:06:02,258 --> 01:06:04,602
Don't speak more than
what's necessary.

727
01:06:06,462 --> 01:06:07,202
Come.

728
01:06:07,830 --> 01:06:09,241
Go that way.

729
01:06:44,166 --> 01:06:46,237
Look, Dr. Dawn...

730
01:06:46,569 --> 01:06:49,345
...is one of the best
doctors in Calcutta.

731
01:06:54,744 --> 01:06:57,224
The nurses say
you're not eating...

732
01:06:59,215 --> 01:07:00,523
You're not eating at all...

733
01:07:00,649 --> 01:07:02,720
...how can you carry
on like this?

734
01:07:04,253 --> 01:07:06,130
You must rest faith in God.

735
01:07:10,659 --> 01:07:12,332
What's wrong, Ashima?

736
01:07:15,264 --> 01:07:16,140
Ashima?

737
01:07:18,768 --> 01:07:21,544
Why don't they give
me the baby just once?

738
01:07:25,775 --> 01:07:29,416
How will they, unless
the jaundice is cured?

739
01:07:31,514 --> 01:07:32,891
For the baby...

740
01:07:34,550 --> 01:07:36,154
...from today... err...

741
01:07:36,218 --> 01:07:37,595
...a separate...

742
01:07:37,653 --> 01:07:40,827
...a special incubator
has been arranged.

743
01:07:45,628 --> 01:07:47,733
See, Ashima, to me
you are very...

744
01:07:48,864 --> 01:07:51,606
...you're very important.
The fact that you're alright...

745
01:07:52,168 --> 01:07:54,842
Your health is the most...-
-Liars!

746
01:07:55,771 --> 01:07:59,617
All of you are lying!
Just once...

747
01:07:59,742 --> 01:08:01,847
...let me see my baby just once.

748
01:08:02,178 --> 01:08:03,714
I want to go once!

749
01:08:03,879 --> 01:08:04,584
Just once!

750
01:08:04,847 --> 01:08:07,148
Ashima! Come on!

751
01:08:07,149 --> 01:08:09,322
Can't you let me go
just once?

752
01:08:09,618 --> 01:08:11,529
I shall go!-
- Don't get up Ashima!

753
01:08:12,621 --> 01:08:14,897
Your stitches have not healed yet!
-I must go!!

754
01:08:15,658 --> 01:08:18,138
The stitches haven't healed
yet! What are you doing!

755
01:08:18,260 --> 01:08:20,831
Let me go! I want to go!-
-Listen to me, honey.

756
01:08:20,930 --> 01:08:22,238
Nurse!!

757
01:08:24,166 --> 01:08:25,645
Listen to me once!

758
01:08:26,368 --> 01:08:28,541
Please leave.
We'll take care of her.

759
01:08:28,737 --> 01:08:31,547
Calm down. You will surely
see your baby.

760
01:08:31,841 --> 01:08:34,447
Your baby will be given
to you. Calm down.

761
01:08:34,844 --> 01:08:36,346
You mustn't get excited.

762
01:08:36,946 --> 01:08:39,187
We just saw the baby.
Didn't we?

763
01:08:39,615 --> 01:08:41,649
The child is healthy, happy...

764
01:08:41,650 --> 01:08:42,651
You'll see your baby!

765
01:08:42,718 --> 01:08:43,719
Calm down please...

766
01:08:44,153 --> 01:08:46,224
You need to get well
for your baby.

767
01:08:48,524 --> 01:08:52,131
Her pressure needs to be checked.
And call the doctor.

768
01:08:58,834 --> 01:08:59,744
Sir?

769
01:09:01,170 --> 01:09:02,308
I heard from Moloy...

770
01:09:02,371 --> 01:09:04,351
Aren't you Apu from
'Pather Panchali'?

771
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:05,510
May I have an
autograph please?-

772
01:09:05,574 --> 01:09:06,609
Who's Apu?

773
01:09:06,876 --> 01:09:09,152
I'm not Apu! You're wrong!

774
01:09:09,378 --> 01:09:11,119
Nonsense!

775
01:09:14,517 --> 01:09:16,224
Once you come
back from Germany...

776
01:09:16,719 --> 01:09:18,426
I'll make a documentary
on you.

777
01:09:21,323 --> 01:09:23,234
It'll be an honest documentation.

778
01:09:24,260 --> 01:09:25,432
In what way?

779
01:09:26,362 --> 01:09:27,534
It'll show that you are...

780
01:09:28,464 --> 01:09:29,499
...an introvert.

781
01:09:30,266 --> 01:09:31,609
A little lazy.

782
01:09:32,268 --> 01:09:33,440
Short-tempered.

783
01:09:34,370 --> 01:09:35,405
Miserly y.

784
01:09:36,672 --> 01:09:37,810
Miserly?

785
01:09:39,175 --> 01:09:42,349
I've been com promising on
my work for days to help in yours.

786
01:09:42,478 --> 01:09:43,752
Even the VISA is through.

787
01:09:44,313 --> 01:09:45,724
Have you ever given
me a treat?

788
01:09:47,249 --> 01:09:48,550
What would you have me treat you to?

789
01:09:48,551 --> 01:09:50,531
I'm not inviting myself!

790
01:09:53,556 --> 01:09:54,255
Tell me...

791
01:09:54,256 --> 01:09:56,736
What other flaws did
you see in me?

792
01:09:57,860 --> 01:10:00,204
The mention of 'Apu'
makes you angry.

793
01:10:01,263 --> 01:10:02,640
Or rather, it irritates you.

794
01:10:05,367 --> 01:10:06,141
But...

795
01:10:06,235 --> 01:10:07,339
...deep inside...

796
01:10:07,870 --> 01:10:09,747
...you quite enjoy this glory.

797
01:10:13,342 --> 01:10:14,412
Anything else?

798
01:10:16,478 --> 01:10:18,480
Tell me frankly, Uncle...

799
01:10:19,848 --> 01:10:23,295
If Apu weren't there,
would this day have come?

800
01:10:24,820 --> 01:10:27,391
Do you know what
upsets me about Apu?

801
01:10:28,924 --> 01:10:32,133
That fellow never left
me all my life.

802
01:10:32,928 --> 01:10:34,601
He stuck to me like
a shadow.

803
01:10:37,533 --> 01:10:39,410
It's very uncanny.

804
01:10:45,474 --> 01:10:46,452
Let's go.

805
01:11:19,541 --> 01:11:21,350
Get ready.

806
01:11:31,553 --> 01:11:33,396
The baby is no more.

807
01:12:40,556 --> 01:12:43,537
You've been doing
all the asking.

808
01:12:46,762 --> 01:12:48,241
Aren't you excited...

809
01:12:49,365 --> 01:12:51,208
...that you're going
to Germany?

810
01:12:51,734 --> 01:12:52,644
I am.

811
01:12:53,769 --> 01:12:56,841
More so, because I am
taking Apu with me.

812
01:12:58,941 --> 01:13:04,414
You know they sell brick pieces from
the Berlin wall as mementos there.

813
01:13:05,247 --> 01:13:08,785
However costly they might
be, I'll surely buy one.

814
01:13:09,451 --> 01:13:17,131
And then I'll keep it beside
the brick I got from Boral.

815
01:13:18,460 --> 01:13:19,734
Apu in Germany!

816
01:13:20,763 --> 01:13:22,709
I'm the only witness!

817
01:13:25,467 --> 01:13:26,639
Slow down the car please!

818
01:13:27,336 --> 01:13:29,509
What's wrong?-
- Pull over, please!

819
01:13:30,572 --> 01:13:32,552
Let this one pass.

820
01:13:43,719 --> 01:13:45,392
What's wrong, Uncle?

821
01:13:45,754 --> 01:13:47,427
A disgusting ritual!

822
01:13:47,723 --> 01:13:48,827
Which one?

823
01:13:49,858 --> 01:13:50,893
Didn't you just see?

824
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:53,169
Staining the feet in crimson...

825
01:13:53,228 --> 01:13:54,832
...for impression on paper.

826
01:13:56,165 --> 01:13:57,235
Morbid!

827
01:13:59,168 --> 01:13:59,839
Sorry.

828
01:14:00,469 --> 01:14:02,210
No, I understand.

829
01:14:06,675 --> 01:14:07,813
Let's go now.

830
01:14:08,343 --> 01:14:09,651
Come on.

831
01:14:25,828 --> 01:14:27,705
Finish this quickly.

832
01:14:36,405 --> 01:14:39,614
This bank of the
river, says with a sigh...

833
01:14:39,741 --> 01:14:43,712
"The other bank
has all happiness, I find."

834
01:14:44,580 --> 01:14:48,585
This bank says,
with a sigh so deep...

835
01:14:49,218 --> 01:14:52,461
"All joy rests, on the
other bank I see."

836
01:14:53,889 --> 01:14:55,766
You will never
understand women.

837
01:14:57,693 --> 01:15:00,173
This depression will get
you nowhere.

838
01:15:00,629 --> 01:15:01,699
Listen...

839
01:15:02,130 --> 01:15:04,474
It's been 15 years of marriage.

840
01:15:04,533 --> 01:15:08,879
I still can't fathom what she thinks!
How can you, in just 2 years?

841
01:15:09,638 --> 01:15:10,446
I would suggest...

842
01:15:10,506 --> 01:15:12,679
...call her mother over
from Burdwan.

843
01:15:13,408 --> 01:15:16,218
The girl is starving, bed-ridden.

844
01:15:16,345 --> 01:15:19,087
She doesn't speak.
This can't go on!

845
01:15:19,181 --> 01:15:22,492
Her mother will be
good for her.

846
01:15:22,718 --> 01:15:24,755
And you, in a way,
are lucky.

847
01:15:24,820 --> 01:15:28,393
So many women
die during delivery.

848
01:15:28,824 --> 01:15:30,497
Your wife is healthy!

849
01:15:31,193 --> 01:15:34,299
And she's still young..
Talk to her, plan another baby.

850
01:15:34,530 --> 01:15:36,737
Only if she'd be willing
to listen!

851
01:15:36,798 --> 01:15:38,709
She doesn't say a word.

852
01:15:39,201 --> 01:15:42,512
Doctors say she's going
through a 'depression'.

853
01:15:42,704 --> 01:15:45,412
Even my words have
no effect on her.

854
01:15:46,141 --> 01:15:48,314
Subir, the Boss would
like to see you.

855
01:15:48,644 --> 01:15:50,351
Me?-
- Yes.

856
01:15:52,247 --> 01:15:53,419
Subir...

857
01:15:53,715 --> 01:15:54,849
Dulal is in a good mood.

858
01:15:54,850 --> 01:15:57,592
Try and get a
week's leave sanctioned.

859
01:15:57,653 --> 01:16:00,395
Then go for a holiday.
You'll both feel better.

860
01:16:00,455 --> 01:16:01,593
I'll try.

861
01:16:01,723 --> 01:16:02,758
Let's go...

862
01:16:11,833 --> 01:16:13,369
Yes, tell me.

863
01:16:13,602 --> 01:16:14,580
Oh.

864
01:16:16,438 --> 01:16:17,439
Hello.

865
01:16:18,774 --> 01:16:20,253
Yes, tell me.

866
01:16:25,414 --> 01:16:26,484
What!

867
01:16:32,254 --> 01:16:33,824
Bad news?

868
01:16:39,728 --> 01:16:40,706
Subir?

869
01:16:42,264 --> 01:16:44,301
I must go...

870
01:16:45,567 --> 01:16:46,511
...home.

871
01:17:21,370 --> 01:17:23,671
How did it happen?

872
01:17:23,672 --> 01:17:26,209
She did it herself.

873
01:17:27,175 --> 01:17:29,553
The baby took Ashima
away from me.

874
01:17:32,314 --> 01:17:33,520
Come.

875
01:18:21,363 --> 01:18:22,637
Is it still burning?

876
01:18:24,366 --> 01:18:27,142
No blisters, though.
Mother applied an ointment.

877
01:18:27,936 --> 01:18:29,813
Can't you be a
little more careful?

878
01:18:33,575 --> 01:18:36,647
The handle of the oven came off.
What could I have done?

879
01:18:45,654 --> 01:18:48,635
Everyone in the neighbourhood
has cooking gas.

880
01:18:49,324 --> 01:18:50,735
Even Bubai has one.

881
01:18:52,160 --> 01:18:54,261
You say you love me...

882
01:18:54,262 --> 01:18:56,333
...but you don't buy me cooking gas.

883
01:18:56,865 --> 01:18:58,139
I will.

884
01:18:59,534 --> 01:19:01,207
Oh 'yes!

885
01:19:07,676 --> 01:19:09,477
When I get the Puja bonus...

886
01:19:09,478 --> 01:19:11,583
...the first thing I'll
buy is cooking gas.

887
01:19:12,214 --> 01:19:13,887
Let me see your hand.

888
01:19:14,449 --> 01:19:17,430
No, let it be.
Not while you're eating.

889
01:19:18,453 --> 01:19:20,433
Your office isn't dependable.

890
01:19:20,756 --> 01:19:23,532
Increments are rare.

891
01:19:26,561 --> 01:19:27,835
They've promised a raise.

892
01:19:30,465 --> 01:19:32,206
They've been saying
that for ages!

893
01:19:32,267 --> 01:19:35,544
But you still can't come
home before 7 pm!

894
01:19:37,873 --> 01:19:39,181
Tell me...

895
01:19:39,241 --> 01:19:41,619
Did you lie to me?

896
01:19:42,878 --> 01:19:46,587
...That your typing speed's
gone up from 30 to 70?

897
01:19:46,715 --> 01:19:50,651
Yes, that's true. Come to my
office and see for yourself.

898
01:19:50,652 --> 01:19:52,529
It'll be proved.

899
01:19:52,754 --> 01:19:55,428
Not 70.
I'll make it 80 now.

900
01:19:55,757 --> 01:19:59,227
Then why do you come
home at 7 pm everyday?

901
01:20:01,163 --> 01:20:02,233
What do you mean?

902
01:20:03,665 --> 01:20:06,441
When the speed was
30, you'd come at 7 pm.

903
01:20:06,535 --> 01:20:09,539
Now its 70, but
you still come at 7 pm.

904
01:20:09,938 --> 01:20:11,349
God knows how!

905
01:20:21,516 --> 01:20:22,586
Here.

906
01:21:13,335 --> 01:21:14,712
What is it!

907
01:21:14,836 --> 01:21:15,610
No... err..-

908
01:21:15,670 --> 01:21:17,149
Move!!

909
01:21:20,542 --> 01:21:21,612
Subir!

910
01:21:31,253 --> 01:21:33,494
I think we should
take her down.

911
01:21:33,755 --> 01:21:35,428
It's time.

912
01:21:38,360 --> 01:21:40,897
Lift that side up!
Be careful!

913
01:21:54,776 --> 01:21:56,153
Kakababu(Ray)

914
01:21:56,645 --> 01:21:58,716
...had sent somebody for me...

915
01:21:59,347 --> 01:22:00,621
...when he was casting
for 'Aparajito'.

916
01:22:01,249 --> 01:22:02,728
My age was just right.

917
01:22:05,453 --> 01:22:08,229
And the boy who got
the role...Pinaki?

918
01:22:09,724 --> 01:22:12,534
His age was also perfect.

919
01:22:14,262 --> 01:22:15,502
But...

920
01:22:16,765 --> 01:22:20,338
...the image of Apu that
Kakababu(Ray) had in mind...

921
01:22:22,837 --> 01:22:24,817
Pinaki fit into that.

922
01:22:27,776 --> 01:22:30,552
And so l couldn't be
a part of 'Aparajito’.

923
01:22:31,546 --> 01:22:32,820
Didn't it hurt?

924
01:22:33,748 --> 01:22:35,523
Can't really remember.

925
01:22:37,352 --> 01:22:38,729
Often...

926
01:22:39,354 --> 01:22:40,731
...one thought would haunt me...

927
01:22:43,458 --> 01:22:46,200
I was made to part
ways with Apu...

928
01:22:48,363 --> 01:22:51,742
...but did Apu and I
part ways at all?

929
01:22:52,834 --> 01:22:55,144
The script of the Apu Trilogy...

930
01:22:57,672 --> 01:22:59,743
...seemed to have been
written for me.

931
01:22:59,841 --> 01:23:01,252
Mr. Banerjee.

932
01:23:01,643 --> 01:23:03,350
Please come.-
- Yes.

933
01:23:05,647 --> 01:23:06,717
Your son?

934
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:13,194
Let's go.

935
01:23:13,254 --> 01:23:14,130
Come.

936
01:24:07,509 --> 01:24:09,785
Your entire life lies
ahead, my child.

937
01:24:11,146 --> 01:24:12,557
This way...

938
01:24:12,881 --> 01:24:15,657
You can't go on
brooding like this.

939
01:24:16,684 --> 01:24:19,324
You're not taking calls
from friends.

940
01:24:19,754 --> 01:24:23,361
You even misbehaved
with Alok yesterday.

941
01:24:25,493 --> 01:24:26,563
Her photograph...

942
01:24:27,195 --> 01:24:28,731
...the crimson imprint
of her feet...

943
01:24:29,364 --> 01:24:32,140
The more you keep
looking at them...

944
01:24:32,200 --> 01:24:34,544
...the more you grieve.

945
01:24:35,470 --> 01:24:37,143
Start afresh.

946
01:24:44,479 --> 01:24:48,723
Her clothes, jewellery,
all her belongings...

947
01:24:49,484 --> 01:24:51,760
...return them all
to her family.

948
01:24:56,658 --> 01:24:57,568
What?

949
01:24:58,293 --> 01:25:00,273
Heard what I said?

950
01:25:02,597 --> 01:25:03,735
Can any mother...

951
01:25:04,466 --> 01:25:05,672
...bear this...

952
01:25:06,468 --> 01:25:08,379
...day in and day out?

953
01:26:36,791 --> 01:26:39,101
Please check everything Subhash.

954
01:26:39,160 --> 01:26:40,833
Everything is
in the suitcase.

955
01:26:42,497 --> 01:26:46,343
How can everything
be there, Subir?

956
01:26:47,168 --> 01:26:49,114
Subhash, please check
the jewellery.

957
01:26:49,170 --> 01:26:50,274
There.

958
01:26:57,478 --> 01:27:00,652
Mother passed away within
two months of Kali's death.

959
01:27:01,282 --> 01:27:04,354
We thought it better
not to inform you.

960
01:27:16,264 --> 01:27:17,675
I'll take your leave.

961
01:27:36,251 --> 01:27:37,457
Why grandson?

962
01:27:39,287 --> 01:27:41,426
How can you go
without having lunch?

963
01:27:41,489 --> 01:27:42,729
And where will you go?

964
01:27:46,194 --> 01:27:48,765
Go take a bath.
I'll serve you lunch.

965
01:27:54,402 --> 01:27:56,848
What are you staring at?
Take him along!

966
01:27:57,205 --> 01:27:58,445
Yes.

967
01:27:59,507 --> 01:28:00,850
Brother-in-law, please
come with me.

968
01:28:00,908 --> 01:28:02,478
Go, my boy-

969
01:28:08,683 --> 01:28:09,457
Thank you.

970
01:28:10,385 --> 01:28:11,455
For what?

971
01:28:12,287 --> 01:28:13,459
What did I do?

972
01:28:13,821 --> 01:28:15,266
Thanks to Subir Banerjee...

973
01:28:15,556 --> 01:28:17,263
...I'm flying Business Class.

974
01:28:19,661 --> 01:28:20,833
In that case...

975
01:28:21,362 --> 01:28:22,841
...I need to thank Apu.

976
01:28:24,399 --> 01:28:25,434
Why?

977
01:28:26,401 --> 01:28:28,142
It's because of that
little fellow...

978
01:28:28,202 --> 01:28:30,478
...that I'm taking my
first flight ever.

979
01:28:31,472 --> 01:28:33,748
Oh!
This is your first time?

980
01:28:33,841 --> 01:28:34,876
Nice!

981
01:29:14,482 --> 01:29:16,860
[chants]

982
01:29:49,183 --> 01:29:49,752
Hey...

983
01:29:52,153 --> 01:29:54,463
ls your name Apu?

984
01:30:02,497 --> 01:30:03,737
Tunu!
