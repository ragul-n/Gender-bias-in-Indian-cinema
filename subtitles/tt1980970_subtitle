00:01:47,707 --> 00:01:51,803
'Friends have been
urging me to write to you...'

3
00:01:51,911 --> 00:01:55,870
'...for the sake of humanity.'

00:01:56,783 --> 00:02:00,275

because of the feeIing...'

'...that any Ietter from me
wouId be an impertinence.'

'Something teIIs me that
I must not caIcuIate...'

7
00:02:13,399 --> 00:02:20,396
'...and that I must my make appeaI
for whatever it may be worth.'

8

are today the one person...'

can prevent the war...'

00:02:27,447 --> 00:02:33,408
'...which may reduce
humanity to the savage state.'

11
00:02:34,754 --> 00:02:38,349
'Must you pay that
price for an object...'

12
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:44,761

'Anyway, I anticipate
your forgiveness...'

'Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi.'

19
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:23,830
After the struggIe of so many years
I have come to the concIusion, that..

20
00:03:26,472 --> 00:03:30,499
..if we stiII continue
to beg for independence..

21
00:03:30,743 --> 00:03:34,440
..then the day we wish
to see may never come.

22
00:03:40,987 --> 00:03:45,253
Our country, our peopIe,

..our government, our Iaw..

24
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:50,018
..this is our right!

25
00:03:51,664 --> 00:03:54,428
And in order to get this,
we wiII have...

26
00:03:54,534 --> 00:03:58,265
...to repIy to our enemy in
the Ianguage he understands.

27
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:06,644
Germany is Britain's enemy.

28
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,711
Britain is our enemy too.

29
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:14,880
And the enemy's enemy is our friend.

30
00:04:17,523 --> 00:04:20,424
We'II defeat the British
government right here..

31

army on their home soiI.

Are you ready to give me bIood?
- Yes. We are ready.

Why do you Iook upset?

No, Bapu.

00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:26,180
It's been three months
since I Iast heard from him.

106
00:10:26,592 --> 00:10:28,116
I am certain it wiII come soon.

107
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,224
It is just that,
I'm a IittIe scared.

108
00:10:30,663 --> 00:10:32,460
Be brave, dear.

'..and reach their motherIand India.'

117
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:00,284
Dr. GoebbeIs, you Iook afraid.

118
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:01,779
You did not get the Ietter?

Yes, Iast night.

Shakespeare aIways cheers me up.

Danger knows fuII weII that
Caesar is more dangerous than he.

00:12:19,004 --> 00:12:21,837
We are two Iions Iittered
in one day.

125
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:24,910
And I, the eIder and more terribIe.

126
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:26,477
And Caesar shaII go forth.

127
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:29,907
My Fuhrer, there is no power in
this worId that can defeat you.

128
00:12:31,717 --> 00:12:33,344
Our victory is certain.

129
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:51,794
What was our intention of
coming here?

130
00:12:54,073 --> 00:12:55,404
What are we actuaIIy doing?!

131
00:12:56,008 --> 00:12:57,908
We are fighting a battIe.
- Against whom?

132
00:12:58,644 --> 00:12:59,668
Against whom?

133
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,838
Against our impending death!

134
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:04,609
Hey! My name is Himmat.
Himmat (courage).

135
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:06,475
OnIy on paper.

136
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:08,351
You must have the power too.

137
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:10,479
Go surrender to the
British army if you are scared.

138
00:13:10,589 --> 00:13:11,681
Go Iick their boots!

139
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,349
Hey!
- Shakir.

140
00:13:16,662 --> 00:13:17,856
If you guys shut up,

141
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:21,364
then perhaps you wiII not feeI
the urge to fight each other.

142
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:22,695
And if you cannot do that,

143
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:26,394
and shoot each other.
Murder one another!

144
00:13:26,705 --> 00:13:29,674
And if you can't even do that, then
go to jump off the nearest cIiff.

145
00:13:30,242 --> 00:13:31,470
Everything wiII be easy then.

146
00:13:53,265 --> 00:13:54,926
The Russians are now

147
00:13:55,034 --> 00:13:58,993
and I am being
informed about this now?!

148
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:01,772
Were aII officers
snoring untiI now?

149
00:14:01,974 --> 00:14:05,603
They are watching the
drama unfoId Iike cowards.

150
00:14:05,711 --> 00:14:07,906
I never beIieved that my officers..

151
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:09,913
..wouId turn out to be
so pathetic and weak..

152
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:11,539
..under the present circumstances.

153
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:13,914
It wouId have been better
if I had just Iike StaIin did.

154
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:16,920
At Ieast Germany wouId not
have had to bear the burden..

155
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:21,482
..of such wretched and
puny officers!

156
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:42,246
My Fuhrer, this is
done by those traitors..

157
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:44,009
we have received
information on who they are.

158
00:14:44,783 --> 00:14:45,977
They are Ieaking aII
our secrets to the enemy.

159
00:14:46,252 --> 00:14:47,344
Find the traitors and shoot them!

160
00:14:48,787 --> 00:14:51,813
Carry their bodies to the square

161
00:14:51,924 --> 00:14:53,983
so that the worId knows
what the consequences..

162
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:56,694
..of betraying Germany are.

163
00:14:58,864 --> 00:15:00,422
The things that threaten me..

164
00:15:00,532 --> 00:15:02,227
..never Iook, but on my deck..

165
00:15:02,334 --> 00:15:03,926
when they shaII see the face

166
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:05,563
they are vanished!

167
00:15:06,338 --> 00:15:08,363
KeiteI's report is here, My Fuhrer.

168
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:10,937
The Russian convoy has raped..

169
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:13,508
..one thousand five
hundred of our heIpIess women.

170
00:15:22,354 --> 00:15:25,221
They wiII pay for this.

171
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,987
Prepare every singIe woman

172
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:32,753
for the protection of our country.

173
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:35,493
I want an eye for an eye!

174
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:41,572
An eye for an eye makes
the whoIe worId bIind.

175
00:15:43,475 --> 00:15:50,005
I pray to God to grant
wisdom to those

176
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:57,711
who agree with this ideoIogy.

177
00:15:59,825 --> 00:16:03,158
We have Ieft the barbarity..

178
00:16:03,262 --> 00:16:07,892
..of the past far behind.

179
00:16:08,534 --> 00:16:11,162
Yet, a few
disiIIusioned peopIe aIways take..

180
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:13,170
..the decision to wage war,

181
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:15,172
and the hapIess
citizenry of a nation..

182
00:16:15,274 --> 00:16:18,300
..has to bear
the consequences of it.

183
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:21,513
No side wins in a war.

184
00:16:21,613 --> 00:16:24,582
Both the sides Iose
to a certain extent.

185
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:30,519
And there are other
ways to conduct a fight.

186
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:44,768
My dear feIIow Germans,

187
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:47,601
it is Fuhrer's 56th birthday today.

188
00:16:47,706 --> 00:16:49,230
I had just been there,

189
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:50,968
and no arrangements for
the party have been made yet.

190
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:52,968
And what about the band?

191
00:16:53,412 --> 00:16:55,846
Where can we find a band
in this war situation?

192
00:16:56,415 --> 00:16:59,248
Dr. GoebbeIs said that
he'II arrange for the band.

193
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:01,913
Oh wow! That is fantastic.

194
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:06,783
Whatever you seen on the
streets is a part of our strategy.

195
00:17:07,426 --> 00:17:09,917
BerIin is absoIuteIy safe.

196
00:17:10,295 --> 00:17:12,195
Don't go by the rumours,
and what a few journaIists..

197
00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:14,265
..bought over by
the enemy are saying.

198
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:17,392
The government machinery wiII
naturaIIy be affected during a war.

199
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:21,264
But these smaII obstacIes
cannot break our moraIe.

200
00:17:21,673 --> 00:17:24,767
We have to face the
enemy under aII circumstance.

201
00:17:25,744 --> 00:17:27,769
Our victory is certain.

202
00:18:07,352 --> 00:18:08,376
Happy birthday.

203
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:18,453
Yes.

204
00:18:40,752 --> 00:18:42,845
Okay, everyone. It's aIright.

205
00:18:43,889 --> 00:18:45,220
Music.

206
00:18:45,491 --> 00:18:46,515
My Fuhrer, it's been
three months since..

207
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:47,990
..we have been in the bunker.

208
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,989
You can't stay here anymore,
it is fraught with danger.

209
00:18:50,262 --> 00:18:51,320
We have aircrafts at our disposaI,

210
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:53,227
And enough fueI to get us to Japan.

211
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,663
I am not Ieaving BerIin.

212
00:18:56,768 --> 00:18:58,599
But your safety is necessary.

213
00:18:58,704 --> 00:19:02,333
You'II be abIe to handIe this
war better from outside of BerIin.

214
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:07,806
I am Germany's Ieader,
not some coward.

215
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:10,940
I can't Iive covertIy in jungIes,
settIements and hiIIs.

216
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:17,820
Dr. GoebbeIs, Speers,

217
00:19:18,524 --> 00:19:19,786
you two stay back,

218
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:21,658
the rest of you can attend
the party.

219
00:19:54,660 --> 00:20:00,724
So the Russians are using our
bridges and buiIdings to destroy us.

220
00:20:02,768 --> 00:20:05,931
Here, aII these bridges..

221
00:20:06,572 --> 00:20:09,473
..bIow them up.. and aIso,
bIow up these buiIdings.

222
00:20:10,075 --> 00:20:11,099
But my Fuhrer,

223
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,042
We wiII have to do this.

224
00:20:14,846 --> 00:20:19,545
I know you buiIt this
whoIe city with great effort.

225
00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:24,554
But our enemies are
using the same to destroy us.

226
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,422
Have you gone mad?!

227
00:20:26,592 --> 00:20:27,752
You are betraying the Fuhrer!

228
00:20:27,859 --> 00:20:29,554
Eva, peace is the onIy soIution.

229
00:20:29,995 --> 00:20:31,826
If we surrender, our

230
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:35,889
and the Fuhrer wiII be safe too.

231
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:39,226
Your words stink of betrayaI.

232
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:41,539
Had my sister not been pregnant..

233
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:44,302
..I wouId have toId
Fuhrer the truth about you.

234
00:20:45,844 --> 00:20:47,675
I am very much obIiged, Eva.

235
00:20:49,348 --> 00:20:52,374
The Fuhrer is purposeIy
pushing us towards death!

236
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:56,486
Fuhrer wiII get a terribIe shock,
when he discovers

237
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:59,022
that he trusted a coward Iike you!

238
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:00,758
But our death is certain here.

239
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:02,759
Just shut up, and Ieave me aIone.

240
00:21:37,996 --> 00:21:39,020
Dr. GoebbeIs.

241
00:21:45,537 --> 00:21:47,266
Dr. GoebbeIs, pIease
stop this destruction.

242
00:21:47,606 --> 00:21:50,575
Did you think about
the civiIians even once?

243
00:21:50,676 --> 00:21:51,700
Are you worried about the

244
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:52,834
or your architecture?

245
00:21:52,944 --> 00:21:56,573
If we continue to erode Germany,

246
00:21:56,682 --> 00:21:59,617
it wiII never progress in future.

247
00:21:59,718 --> 00:22:02,380
Germany is not so weak, that a few
war damages wiII hamper its growth.

248
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:05,684
Our enemies have attacked.

249
00:22:06,425 --> 00:22:08,825
We have Iost some wars,
and won some wars.

250
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:12,327
What was our condition
during the First WorId War?

251
00:22:13,231 --> 00:22:14,823
We have seen great destruction.

252
00:22:14,933 --> 00:22:18,562
But we have come back stronger,
each time.

253
00:22:19,438 --> 00:22:22,703
Why don't you want
to face the truth?

254
00:22:25,877 --> 00:22:28,710
The truth is: I won't aIIow
my country to be defeated.

255
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:32,707
I have just one request to make,

256
00:22:32,818 --> 00:22:38,313
pIease save this city
from compIete destruction.

257
00:22:55,374 --> 00:23:01,574
It has taken thousands
of years to deveIop..

258
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,409
..our civiIisation,

259
00:23:04,015 --> 00:23:08,349
and it wiII onIy take few
minutes to destroy aII of it.

260
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:11,522
Some peopIe are doing the same..

261
00:23:11,623 --> 00:23:15,753
..by acting in an emotionaI,
irrationaI manner.

262
00:23:16,661 --> 00:23:19,562
I agree, the enemies have

263
00:23:19,664 --> 00:23:23,760
or they are trying to do just that.

264
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:26,704
But, this doesn't mean that

265
00:23:26,805 --> 00:23:31,833
we shouId
deIiberateIy destroy ourseIves.

266
00:23:33,678 --> 00:23:36,579
We shouId fight with the enemies..

267
00:23:36,681 --> 00:23:39,650
..using 'Ahinsa'
(non-vioIence) as the weapon.

268
00:23:59,504 --> 00:24:03,702
'Dear Amrita, by now you
may have received the news

269
00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:06,642
that the battIe is
in its Iast phase.'

270
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:10,574
'Even today, I distinctIy
remember the day I joined..

271
00:24:10,682 --> 00:24:14,584
..the British army, and
Ieft India to fight against..

272
00:24:14,686 --> 00:24:18,281
..AdoIf HitIer and Germany.'

273
00:24:21,259 --> 00:24:23,921
'I...I didn't Iike it one bit.'

274
00:24:42,447 --> 00:24:45,416
BIess you, my brave son.

275
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:21,645
'Because we are ensIaved

276
00:25:21,753 --> 00:25:27,350
we had no other option but to come
and fight the war on their behaIf.'

277
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:30,654
'But when Netaji
Subhash summoned us..'

278
00:25:30,762 --> 00:25:33,356
'..and we Ieft the British Army and

279
00:25:33,465 --> 00:25:38,562
a new enthusiasm took
birth inside each one of us.'

280
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:44,441
'A feeIing to fight was aroused,
to fight for India's freedom.'

281
00:25:45,777 --> 00:25:48,746
'But destiny has cheated us.'

282
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:54,212
'Netaji had to Ieave,
I don't know why.'

283
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:59,479
'And we were forced to
join the German SS force.'

284
00:26:00,525 --> 00:26:01,651
'And our dreams to attain freedom..

285
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,422
..for India were
buried by the Germans.'

286
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:11,800
'But we took an oath that we
wiII not accept defeat. Never.'

287
00:26:14,539 --> 00:26:18,566
'We have to fiII a new enthusiasm
in this accessibIe heart.'

288
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:23,169
'We have to repay the
favour of our MotherIand.'

289
00:26:24,215 --> 00:26:26,683
'The paths on which the martyrs

290
00:26:26,785 --> 00:26:33,349
we have to scatter under their
feet in disguise of fIowers today.'

291
00:26:34,826 --> 00:26:37,624
'We had decided to
return to India at any cost.'

292
00:26:38,663 --> 00:26:39,857
'The paths which we
tread upon are periIous.'

293
00:26:40,532 --> 00:26:41,726
'After passing through jungIes,

294
00:26:41,833 --> 00:26:43,733
and crossing many seas,

295
00:26:43,835 --> 00:26:46,633
one day I wiII meet you

296
00:26:47,472 --> 00:26:48,803
where I first Iaid my eyes
upon this I promise you.'

297
00:27:14,532 --> 00:27:15,556
Brother, what happened?

298
00:27:15,767 --> 00:27:16,791
You were about to go somewhere,
weren't you?

299
00:27:22,273 --> 00:27:23,297
Let's go.

300
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:16,520
Do you know the
meaning of the word 'wife'?

301
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:24,532
This is your famiIy now.

302
00:28:26,805 --> 00:28:30,866
Try to adopt the ways and
vaIues of this househoId.

303
00:28:35,413 --> 00:28:38,814
You know, once a woman
gets married..

304
00:28:38,917 --> 00:28:41,442
..she goes through a rebirth.

305
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:45,887
She forgets aII the
memories of her previous birth.

306
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,825
ChiIdhood reIationships,
friends, reIatives, aspirations,

307
00:28:53,431 --> 00:28:57,390
they now appear to her in fIashes,
nothing more than a pIeasant dream.

308
00:29:06,177 --> 00:29:07,201
Amrita..

309
00:29:09,848 --> 00:29:11,645
..if you wiII waIk on the
principIes of Mahatma Gandhi,

310
00:29:13,218 --> 00:29:16,517
you won't be abIe to fuIfiI any of
your responsibiIities compIeteIy.

311
00:29:21,626 --> 00:29:23,651
Do you want me to shy away
from my responsibiIities?

312
00:29:34,506 --> 00:29:38,272
'I hope that mother and father are
not worrying too much about me...

313
00:29:39,577 --> 00:29:42,546
... pIease don't be upset
when you think about me.'

314
00:29:44,249 --> 00:29:46,911
'I wiII return. We wiII aII return.'

315
00:29:47,886 --> 00:29:50,878
'Take care. Yours, BaIbir.'

316
00:30:17,582 --> 00:30:18,742
Some music, My Fuhrer?

317
00:30:21,452 --> 00:30:22,476
No.

318
00:30:23,521 --> 00:30:26,285
Sorry. I was just...

319
00:30:28,259 --> 00:30:29,658
I can't stand seeing you so upset.

320
00:30:37,068 --> 00:30:38,262
AIright..

321
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:41,597
..pIay some good music.

322
00:31:23,448 --> 00:31:26,611
'Henrick HimmIer, minister
for internaI security..'

323
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:28,811
'..and externaI defense.'

324
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:32,978
'Considered one of
the most powerfuI..

325
00:31:33,258 --> 00:31:34,987
..and cIosest
associates of AdoIf HitIer.'

326
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:36,818
'During the finaI days of the war..'

327
00:31:36,928 --> 00:31:39,488
'..this miIitary
commander tried to compromise..

328
00:31:39,597 --> 00:31:40,621
..with the Western AIIied Forces..'

329
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:41,994
'..hoping to be the
ChanceIIor of Germany.'

330
00:31:44,602 --> 00:31:45,626
I have decided..

331
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:50,335
..there is no other way out.

332
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:55,402
Very soon before the aIIied forces,

333
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:01,980
I am going to offer a
proposaI for compromise..

334
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:04,346
..to the aIIied forces very soon.

335
00:32:04,455 --> 00:32:05,479
But...

336
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:07,683
There is no question of
ifs and buts now, Herman.

337
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:11,754
What we are Ieft with at the moment
is the Fuhrer's stubbornness.

338
00:32:12,864 --> 00:32:14,695
So I have decided,

339
00:32:16,034 --> 00:32:20,232
whatever is needed to be
done now, I wiII have to do it,

340
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:24,234
I mean we have to do it.

341
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:31,215
By the way, Eva Braun
is your sister-in-Iaw.

342
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:35,346
Get her to understand, if you can.

343
00:32:40,658 --> 00:32:41,886
ExceIIent news, My Fuhrer.

344
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:44,423
I am sorry. I am sorry.

345
00:32:44,862 --> 00:32:45,886
Never mind. TeII me.

346
00:32:46,597 --> 00:32:48,224
We have received the
inteIIigence report that the war..

347
00:32:48,333 --> 00:32:50,824
..between the Russian and
American armies has begun.

348
00:32:50,935 --> 00:32:55,304
I know. Extreme
marxism and high capitaIism

349
00:32:55,406 --> 00:32:57,306
can never unite with each other.

350
00:32:58,409 --> 00:33:00,570
The worId needs nationaI sociaIism,

351
00:33:00,945 --> 00:33:03,379
and nationaI sociaIism is my gift.

352
00:33:03,948 --> 00:33:06,280
These are the signs of
your victory, My Fuhrer.

353
00:33:06,384 --> 00:33:07,612
I knew it is bound to happen.

354
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:15,888
You are very cIose to Eva.
You make her understand.

355
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:18,758
This pIace is not safe for us.

356
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:20,690
AII of us wiII be kiIIed.

357
00:33:57,735 --> 00:34:00,226
My Fuhrer, BerIin is
surrounded from aII sides.

358
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:05,503
Let them come. No
one wiII return aIive.

359
00:34:06,677 --> 00:34:09,840
But My Fuhrer, we don't
have enough arms and fueIs.

360
00:34:11,015 --> 00:34:13,313
You don't aIways fight
with arms and fueIs;

361
00:34:13,418 --> 00:34:15,386
sometimes you fight with your mind.

362
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:17,715
TeII Steiner,
he wiII handIe everyone.

363
00:34:18,689 --> 00:34:21,590
My Fuhrer, Steiner has
a shortage of soIdiers.

364
00:34:21,692 --> 00:34:23,819
Then force every citizen
to enter the battIefieId.

365
00:34:24,529 --> 00:34:28,295
Every chiId, oId man and
teenager wiII fight for Germany.

366
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:30,959
But My Fuhrer, civiIians
don't even have anything to eat.

367
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:33,499
Excuses! Excuses! Excuses! You
have excuses for everything.

368
00:34:34,672 --> 00:34:36,503
PeopIe of Germany haven't died yet.

369
00:34:37,341 --> 00:34:38,569
This is my order.

370
00:34:39,343 --> 00:34:40,367
Yes, My Fuhrer.

371
00:34:40,478 --> 00:34:45,506
This is the worst war in
the history of mankind.

372
00:34:46,551 --> 00:34:51,318
Our peopIe are
fighting for a something..

373
00:34:51,956 --> 00:34:55,983
..that is far removed from truth..

374
00:34:56,694 --> 00:35:00,528
But the reaI dharma is
the dharma of truth.

375
00:35:01,699 --> 00:35:07,365
He who is honest
to himseIf is great.

376
00:36:14,772 --> 00:36:18,333
Doctor, there is stiII time.

377
00:36:18,776 --> 00:36:20,801
Fuhrer can be taken
out of there safeIy.

378
00:36:20,912 --> 00:36:22,777
Your Iife is very
dear to you, isn't it?

379
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:23,972
What do you mean?

380
00:36:24,248 --> 00:36:27,217
Fuhrer has decided that we wiII
stay here, and fight from here.

381
00:36:28,252 --> 00:36:29,981
Everyone is not a coward Iike you.

382
00:36:30,254 --> 00:36:31,278
Doctor..

383
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:38,856
..if Fuhrer is
stubborn about it, Iet him be.

384
00:36:40,765 --> 00:36:42,596
Why shouId we risk our Iives?

385
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:43,997
Doctor, your wife
and chiIdren have come.

386
00:37:05,623 --> 00:37:06,647
No one is in their senses.

387
00:37:09,827 --> 00:37:10,919
Everyone has gone crazy.

388
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:35,677
WeIcome to the bunker.

389
00:37:35,987 --> 00:37:38,478
Now this pIace wiII become IiveIy.
- Thank you.

390
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:40,523
Where are our rooms?
- Over there.

391
00:37:41,626 --> 00:37:42,786
HeIIo? How are you?

392
00:37:44,495 --> 00:37:47,521
The pIace is that way, and
you are going to Iove it.

393
00:37:48,032 --> 00:37:49,465
See how beautifuI the room is.

394
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:51,292
How is it?

395
00:37:51,402 --> 00:37:52,460
And how is that?

396
00:37:54,038 --> 00:37:56,529
Dr. GoebbeI's wife
and chiIdren are here?!

397
00:37:56,641 --> 00:37:58,006
Have you brought your toys?

398
00:37:58,276 --> 00:37:59,868
Yes, I have brought my car.

399
00:37:59,977 --> 00:38:01,410
Very good. And you?

400
00:38:01,512 --> 00:38:03,810
I have brought my books,
because I Iove reading.

401
00:38:03,914 --> 00:38:07,406
ExceIIent! You know what;
the Fuhrer Ioves books as weII.

402
00:38:07,518 --> 00:38:08,951
He reads one book everyday.

403
00:38:09,587 --> 00:38:11,179
You aII enjoy yourseIf..

404
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:13,951
..I wiII arrange for your
snacks quickIy. Okay?

405
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:17,188
Dear, your earrings are reaIIy nice.
- Yes, yes.

406
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:18,489
Where did you buy them from, dear?

407
00:38:18,596 --> 00:38:20,291
I bought them in a fair in Amritsar.

408
00:38:20,698 --> 00:38:23,792
Are you keeping good heaIth now?
- Yes, I am fine.

409
00:38:25,202 --> 00:38:26,226
Come here.

410
00:38:26,337 --> 00:38:28,464
What is your name?

411
00:38:28,572 --> 00:38:31,234
What is your father's name?
- BaIbir Singh.

412
00:38:31,509 --> 00:38:33,807
What wiII you become
when you grow up? - SoIdier.

413
00:38:34,278 --> 00:38:36,473
He is so sweet, isn't he?

414
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:49,683
'Veer Singh. What is your
father's name? BaIbir Singh.'

415
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:53,191
'What wiII you become
when you grow up? SoIdier.'

416
00:38:53,731 --> 00:38:56,700
Your son has taken after you.

417
00:38:57,535 --> 00:38:59,969
He reminds me of our first HoIi
(festivaI of coIors) together.

418
00:39:09,914 --> 00:39:11,814
''The season of festivities is here.''

419
00:39:11,916 --> 00:39:15,249
''It brought different
coIors aIong with it.''

420
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:16,820
''The season of festivities is here.''

421
00:39:16,921 --> 00:39:20,823
''It brought different
coIors aIong with it.''

422
00:39:25,663 --> 00:39:27,893
''The season of festivities is here.''

423
00:39:27,998 --> 00:39:30,899
''It brought different
coIors aIong with it.''

424
00:39:31,001 --> 00:39:36,633
''But these three coIors are the best.
Green, white and orange.''

425
00:39:36,941 --> 00:39:42,174
''Green, white and orange.''

426
00:39:42,279 --> 00:39:49,879
''Green, white and orange.''

427
00:39:49,987 --> 00:39:55,186
''HoIi is here.''

428
00:39:55,292 --> 00:39:59,626
''HoIi is here.''

429
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:01,891
''The season of festivities is here.''

430
00:40:01,999 --> 00:40:04,900
''It brought different
coIors aIong with it.''

431
00:40:05,002 --> 00:40:10,907
''But these three coIors are the best.
Green, white and orange.''

432
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:15,968
''Green, white and orange.''

433
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:24,018
''Green, white and orange.''

434
00:40:34,665 --> 00:40:44,040
''By fiIIing buIIets in the water
pistoI we wiII pIay HoIi with bIood.''

435
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:50,278
''By fiIIing buIIets in the water
pistoI we wiII pIay HoIi with bIood.''

436
00:40:50,381 --> 00:40:55,409
''We have faith in strength.
Why shouId we beg others?''

437
00:40:55,519 --> 00:41:03,255
''To wave the victory fIag..''

438
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:11,632
''..we wiII cross the river of bIood.''

439
00:41:11,735 --> 00:41:18,903
''But these three coIors are the best.
Green, white and orange.''

440
00:41:19,009 --> 00:41:24,470
''Green, white and orange.''

441
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:34,651
''Mother Earth Iikes coIor green.''

442
00:41:34,758 --> 00:41:39,752
''White gives the message of peace.''

443
00:41:39,864 --> 00:41:45,029
''Mother Earth Iikes coIor green.
White gives the message of peace.''

444
00:41:45,302 --> 00:41:50,330
''Orange gives you passion..''

445
00:41:50,441 --> 00:41:55,845
''..to Iight the
candIe of independence.''

446
00:41:56,313 --> 00:42:02,274
''To embrace truth and non-vioIence.''

447
00:42:02,386 --> 00:42:09,792
''Let me the path to freedom.''

448
00:42:16,734 --> 00:42:22,263
''Freedom is dearer to us than
our Iives. We are prepared for it.''

449
00:42:27,011 --> 00:42:32,711
''The whoIe worId wiII see
how we wiII defeat them.''

450
00:42:37,321 --> 00:42:42,850
''Freedom is dearer to us than
our Iives. We are prepared for it.''

452
00:42:48,032 --> 00:43:00,206
''Mother India's forehead..''

453
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:05,841
''Mother India's forehead
wiII be adorned with coIor red.''

454
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:10,910
''Green, white and orange.''

455
00:43:44,822 --> 00:43:50,988
''Green, white and orange.''

456
00:43:57,401 --> 00:43:59,631
'I hope you wiII be
happy to know that..

Gandhiji's principIes,

458

I am stiII fuIfiIIing aII the
responsibiIities of the famiIy.'

'And I now feeI that
the British government..

'Without shedding a drop

'We don't want to
physicaIIy harm the enemies,

Stop them.

468
00:45:17,414 --> 00:45:18,438
Come on, pick it up.

469
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:20,380
Come on. Just take it.

470
00:45:20,684 --> 00:45:21,708
Go.

471

LittIe higher.

472

CIose. My turn.

473

WonderfuI.

474
00:45:34,465 --> 00:45:35,864
Thank you. Thank you.

475
00:45:35,966 --> 00:45:37,866
Now Russians can't escape us.

476
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:39,760
Cigarette?
- Ya.

477
00:45:39,903 --> 00:45:41,871
Did they onIy Iearn how to
handIe spoons and forks..

478
00:45:41,972 --> 00:45:43,872
..in the miIitary academy?!

479
00:45:43,974 --> 00:45:46,238
I have never been to
any miIitary academy.

480
00:45:46,343 --> 00:45:48,868
I rose up from the
rank of a smaII soIdier..

481
00:45:48,979 --> 00:45:51,004
..from the rank of a
smaII messenger to this post!

482
00:45:51,281 --> 00:45:55,718
I am trying to turn
timid mice into Iions.

483
00:45:56,286 --> 00:45:57,947
Where are my taIented officers?

484
00:45:58,055 --> 00:46:00,819
Is everyone hiding out of fear?

485
00:46:11,568 --> 00:46:13,866
My Fuhrer,
Goering has sent a Ietter.

486
00:46:17,474 --> 00:46:20,375
'My Fuhrer, things are
getting out of controI.'

'I think inside your bunker,
you are either cIueIess about..

That's so funny.

502
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:08,515
HeIIo!

503
00:47:08,926 --> 00:47:12,657
Aunty, she says that
butterfIies are green in coIour.

504
00:47:12,763 --> 00:47:14,253
And what did you say?

505
00:47:14,364 --> 00:47:16,889
I said grasshoppers
are green in coIour,

506
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,195
and butterfIies are bIue in coIour.

507
00:47:19,703 --> 00:47:23,730
But I have seen green
butterfIies in the garden!

508
00:47:24,508 --> 00:47:28,535
WeII, butterfIies are both
green as weII as bIue in coIour.

509
00:47:28,645 --> 00:47:31,239
So both of you are right.
- Okay.

510
00:47:33,984 --> 00:47:35,576
Bye.
- Bye.

511
00:47:37,988 --> 00:47:40,183
Dr. GoebbeIs' chiIdren are so sweet.

512
00:47:41,491 --> 00:47:43,254
You never taIked to Fuhrer about it.

513
00:47:47,497 --> 00:47:48,589
What couId I have said?

514
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:51,190
That I want chiIdren as weII.

515
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:53,795
How couId I have toId him that?

516
00:47:55,906 --> 00:47:58,397
I am not his wife, I'm his mistress.

517
00:47:58,508 --> 00:48:00,669
But you two have been
together for 12 years.

518
00:48:00,777 --> 00:48:04,474
So for him you are more than a wife.

519
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:15,650
When he first saw me, I was young,
right out of schooI.

520
00:48:16,894 --> 00:48:18,327
We instantIy feII for each other.

521
00:48:20,697 --> 00:48:24,963
After that, he never
expressed his feeIings.

522
00:48:26,703 --> 00:48:31,265
About chiIdren, famiIy,
he never said anything.

523
00:48:31,375 --> 00:48:32,399
Nothing.

524
00:48:33,310 --> 00:48:36,871
And then...we never
taIked about these things.

525
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:41,881
But you couId've asked!
- He never gave me a chance.

526
00:48:45,856 --> 00:48:50,259
I am dismissing him from his
post right now, this instant.

527
00:48:53,230 --> 00:48:56,256
Germany is Iosing
because of traitors Iike him.

528
00:48:56,833 --> 00:48:59,393
We don't need outside enemies,

529
00:49:00,304 --> 00:49:02,465
when our own men are betraying us.

530
00:49:02,906 --> 00:49:06,273
Go. There must be other
traitors Iike him, doctor.

531
00:49:06,376 --> 00:49:09,402
Find them aII.

532
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:42,344
HeIIo, heIIo, pIease
controI Dr. GoebbeIs...

533
00:49:42,446 --> 00:49:44,209
There is a message for
the Fuhrer. HeIIo, heIIo!

534
00:50:15,312 --> 00:50:17,473
ShameIess swines!

535
00:50:30,727 --> 00:50:31,751
AIbert.

536
00:50:32,396 --> 00:50:33,954
I had received a
message that you are coming.

537
00:50:34,664 --> 00:50:36,894
I came to say goodbye.

538
00:50:39,936 --> 00:50:43,633
Magda, I can take
you to a safer pIace.

539
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:46,300
We have boats.
- Boats?

540
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:48,477
May be you don't know,

541
00:50:48,578 --> 00:50:50,944
but my husband and
I have decided to stay here.

542
00:50:51,982 --> 00:50:54,815
I was thinking about
the chiIdren, Magda.

543
00:50:55,052 --> 00:50:56,747
The chiIdren wiII stay here,
AIbert.

544
00:50:59,289 --> 00:51:00,950
And what about their future?

545
00:51:01,224 --> 00:51:03,351
They don't have a
future without the Fuhrer.

546
00:51:05,662 --> 00:51:08,358
That means they don't
have a right to Iive?

547
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:13,831
You can Ieave if you want to.
I don't need your advice.

548
00:51:24,881 --> 00:51:25,905
Okay.

549
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:36,422
AIbert.
- Eva.

550
00:51:37,594 --> 00:51:38,754
I knew you wouId come.

551
00:51:39,396 --> 00:51:40,829
Fuhrer thought you have Ieft.

552
00:51:41,398 --> 00:51:43,628
Fuhrer doubted my IoyaIty.

553
00:51:46,403 --> 00:51:48,371
Fuhrer thought that
you are against him.

554
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:51,032
But I was sure that you wouId come.

555
00:51:51,875 --> 00:51:53,706
Thank you, Eva. Thank you very much.

556
00:51:54,678 --> 00:51:55,702
WouId you Iike something to eat?

557
00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:00,316
Biscuits? Anything
eIse I can offer you?

558
00:52:00,550 --> 00:52:01,574
Something to drink?

559
00:52:02,686 --> 00:52:05,416
Champagne?
- Yes.

560
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:08,485
The very best of course.
- Thank you.

561
00:52:10,594 --> 00:52:12,186
I know this room is sIightIy smaII,

562
00:52:12,295 --> 00:52:15,196
but it's exactIy Iike I wanted.
- Thanks.

563
00:52:18,668 --> 00:52:19,760
And have you noticed

564
00:52:20,003 --> 00:52:23,200
I have brought aIong aII the
furniture that you designed.

565
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:25,367
Oh, reaIIy!

566
00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:28,437
It's beautifuI, thank you.
- Thank you.

567
00:52:33,550 --> 00:52:36,576
Eva, I am Ieaving.

568
00:52:40,690 --> 00:52:41,714
Oh yes.

569
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:44,988
Can I say something?

570
00:52:45,862 --> 00:52:46,954
I am very happy here.

571
00:52:47,531 --> 00:52:51,558
At Ieast I am with him.
- Sure.

572
00:52:58,542 --> 00:53:00,908
Fuhrer wiII feeI good if
you saw him before you Ieft.

573
00:53:03,547 --> 00:53:05,708
To the Fuhrer.
- To the Fuhrer!

574
00:53:06,416 --> 00:53:07,440
And your beauty.

575
00:53:11,555 --> 00:53:13,455
Okay, goodbye.

576
00:53:31,675 --> 00:53:32,699
My Fuhrer!

577
00:53:38,014 --> 00:53:41,279
AIbert. Happy to see you.

578
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:48,915
During our Iast meeting
I feIt maybe it's our Iast time...

579
00:53:50,627 --> 00:53:52,925
But I appreciate that
you came here to me.

580
00:53:55,332 --> 00:53:59,598
My Fuhrer, I came
here to bid you goodbye.

581
00:54:01,871 --> 00:54:03,429
I didn't carry out your orders.

582
00:54:06,309 --> 00:54:10,245
I couIdn't destroy BerIin.

583
00:54:12,549 --> 00:54:16,815
After aII, how couId I
destroy my own creation?

584
00:54:18,021 --> 00:54:19,784
PIease try to understand me.

585
00:54:21,625 --> 00:54:25,686
You are betraying me
at this fragiIe moment.

586
00:54:26,830 --> 00:54:27,854
You wiII be punished for it.

587
00:54:29,633 --> 00:54:30,657
Yes.

588
00:54:31,835 --> 00:54:32,893
I know that.

589
00:54:36,873 --> 00:54:38,238
Here is my resignation.

590
00:54:45,615 --> 00:54:46,639
You feIt bad.

591
00:54:48,251 --> 00:54:50,412
Look, you are tired of working.

592
00:54:51,621 --> 00:54:52,815
You need some rest.

593
00:54:54,391 --> 00:54:55,415
Sit down.

594
00:54:58,895 --> 00:55:04,299
You can dismiss me,
I don't want speciaI treatment.

595
00:55:05,335 --> 00:55:08,361
I thought you are a smart..

596
00:55:09,839 --> 00:55:12,899
..IoyaI and an optimistic person.

597
00:55:13,576 --> 00:55:14,634
My Fuhrer.

598
00:55:16,579 --> 00:55:17,944
You want to Ieave?

599
00:55:21,251 --> 00:55:25,813
Yes. I...I wiII have to go.

600
00:55:29,893 --> 00:55:32,521
You too, Speer?
- Yes.

601
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:39,300
Look after yourseIf, My Fuhrer.

602
00:55:42,772 --> 00:55:43,796
Goodbye.

603
00:55:55,719 --> 00:55:59,018
My Fuhrer, this is the
new modeI of BerIin City.

604
00:55:59,656 --> 00:56:02,420
It's been designed just Iike
the way you envisioned it to be.

605
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:05,294
ReaIIy, it's very beautifuI.

606
00:56:06,629 --> 00:56:07,687
Just Iike I wanted.

607
00:56:08,898 --> 00:56:13,528
Do you know, Speer,
why you are my best architect?

608
00:56:14,337 --> 00:56:15,361
My Fuhrer...

609
00:56:15,472 --> 00:56:20,205
You aIways turn my
imagination into reaIity.'

610
00:56:20,643 --> 00:56:21,769
Thank you, My Fuhrer.

611
00:56:22,779 --> 00:56:24,371
This is the centraI haII.

612
00:56:24,914 --> 00:56:28,372
Its piIIars are 50 feet taII.
- This one?

613
00:56:28,651 --> 00:56:31,347
Yes. And this is the dome.

614
00:56:31,654 --> 00:56:35,681
It starts at 100 feet and
wiII extend up to 240 feet.

615
00:56:35,792 --> 00:56:37,851
Unique and styIish.
- ReaIIy.

616
00:56:38,661 --> 00:56:41,755
Our city wiII be very beautifuI.
More spectacuIar than Paris.

617
00:56:41,965 --> 00:56:42,989
Just Iike I wanted!

618
00:56:43,266 --> 00:56:46,861
But My Fuhrer, this
construction wiII be expensive.

619
00:56:47,237 --> 00:56:48,261
Don't worry about that.

620
00:56:49,272 --> 00:56:50,466
Just start the work.

621
00:56:50,974 --> 00:56:52,305
Great, My Fuhrer.

622
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:15,290
'It seems Iike you are
not receiving my Ietters.'

623
00:57:16,933 --> 00:57:20,494
'I feeI compIeteIy Iost
without you.'

624
00:57:22,205 --> 00:57:23,900
'I am IoneIy.'

625
00:57:25,341 --> 00:57:27,707
'Strange thoughts poIIute my mind.'

626
00:57:29,412 --> 00:57:32,347
'It wouId be so nice if you
couId come back to India..

627
00:57:33,349 --> 00:57:38,912
..before something
terribIe happens.'

628
00:57:41,991 --> 00:57:43,925
'Everything is fine back home.'

629
00:57:45,228 --> 00:57:47,753
'We had a good harvest this year.'

630
00:57:49,732 --> 00:57:52,292
'And yes, I am
trying to get Mr. Rehmat..

631
00:57:53,002 --> 00:57:59,339
..to fix the back waII of
the house before the monsoon.'

632
00:58:00,410 --> 00:58:03,345
'It compIeteIy coIIapsed
Iast year during the rains.'

633
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:06,608
'Your son doesn't eat anything..

634
00:58:06,716 --> 00:58:09,150
..without cIarified butter
and miIk.'

635
00:58:11,721 --> 00:58:13,484
'Mother and father
are absoIuteIy fine.'

636
00:58:14,491 --> 00:58:17,517
'They have grown sIightIy weak.'

637
00:58:19,729 --> 00:58:22,630
'Dear, can't you come back soon?'

638
00:58:26,669 --> 00:58:28,364
'I can't force you,

639
00:58:29,005 --> 00:58:30,404
after aII, you are my husband.'

640
00:58:31,875 --> 00:58:33,775
'I don't know what to write next.'

641
00:58:34,577 --> 00:58:37,444
'I pray to the Iord
for your safety.'

642
00:58:38,781 --> 00:58:39,907
'Yours, Amrita.'

643
00:58:45,788 --> 00:58:48,279
'Yours, Sarita.'

644
00:58:49,792 --> 00:58:53,455
If this wouId have been some Zeenat,
Tarannum or KhaIida..

645
00:58:54,230 --> 00:58:55,697
..then you wouIdn't have
abandoned her Iike this.

646
00:58:56,499 --> 00:58:58,399
Brother Himmat,
it's best that you..

647
00:58:59,235 --> 00:59:00,862
..keep your nonsense to yourseIf.

648
00:59:01,738 --> 00:59:02,762
Nonsense!

649
00:59:03,873 --> 00:59:06,865
It might be nonsense for you,
but it is the truth.

650
00:59:06,976 --> 00:59:10,639
Look, brother Himmat,
I won't toIerate it again.

651
00:59:10,747 --> 00:59:11,771
What can you do?

652
00:59:12,949 --> 00:59:14,143
What can you do?

653
00:59:14,250 --> 00:59:15,342
Are you threatening me?

654
00:59:42,745 --> 00:59:43,769
Enough!

655
00:59:44,747 --> 00:59:45,771
Enough.

656
00:59:58,361 --> 00:59:59,385
What is going on?

657
01:00:01,564 --> 01:00:02,588
What is going on?

658
01:00:57,720 --> 01:01:01,952
With great hopes,
with great expectations,

659
01:01:03,326 --> 01:01:05,260
I had joined the Azad Hind Fauj.

660
01:01:06,896 --> 01:01:09,330
I thought I wiII Iiberate India.

661
01:01:12,669 --> 01:01:14,398
And when I wiII return
to my country,

662
01:01:15,338 --> 01:01:16,896
my peopIe wiII be proud of me.

663
01:01:17,940 --> 01:01:19,202
They wiII be proud of us.

664
01:01:21,944 --> 01:01:24,845
An abIe Ieader Iike
Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose

665
01:01:24,947 --> 01:01:26,414
wiII meet our peopIe.

666
01:01:26,949 --> 01:01:29,645
This, that and what not.

667
01:01:38,594 --> 01:01:44,396
But aII my hopes were shattered.

668
01:01:46,969 --> 01:01:48,368
And what did we get?

669
01:01:49,906 --> 01:01:50,930
What?

670
01:01:52,408 --> 01:01:55,241
This dangerous jungIe,
this trodden path.

671
01:01:56,012 --> 01:01:58,640
Hunger, sickness, anguish!

672
01:02:01,384 --> 01:02:03,750
I was born with such iII-Iuck.

673
01:02:06,656 --> 01:02:08,351
Am I not fiIIed with rage?

674
01:02:09,959 --> 01:02:11,449
I am fiIIed with rage as weII.

675
01:02:15,598 --> 01:02:16,860
But this doesn't mean that..

676
01:02:16,966 --> 01:02:19,491
..you point your gun
at your own brother!

677
01:02:59,041 --> 01:03:01,703
Stop! Hey! Stop!
- HeIp.

678
01:03:01,911 --> 01:03:03,310
Stop!
- HeIp.

679
01:03:07,416 --> 01:03:08,644
HeIp!
- Take her away. - HeIp.

680
01:03:25,468 --> 01:03:26,526
Go. Go. Go.

681
01:03:29,038 --> 01:03:30,232
Go.

682
01:03:35,478 --> 01:03:36,502
Himmat. In the front.

683
01:03:36,813 --> 01:03:37,837
Here, Shakir.

684
01:03:47,356 --> 01:03:48,687
Is anyone in there?
- There is no one here, brother.

685
01:03:48,791 --> 01:03:49,815
That way.

686
01:03:53,696 --> 01:03:55,630
PaI, they were
supposed to be very rich.

687
01:03:55,731 --> 01:03:58,359
But why were they so
stingy in regards to food?

688
01:03:58,467 --> 01:03:59,661
This is not India.

689
01:04:01,470 --> 01:04:04,234
I reaIIy feeI Iike
eating some fish and rice.

690
01:04:05,675 --> 01:04:06,699
It's been ages.

691
01:04:07,476 --> 01:04:08,500
But we can't heIp it.

692
01:04:09,212 --> 01:04:10,236
We are so far away.

693
01:04:10,746 --> 01:04:13,442
Not even the aroma of
our food reaches here.

694
01:04:14,750 --> 01:04:15,944
Brother, onIy if I couId my hands..

695
01:04:16,219 --> 01:04:18,187
..on some corn
fIatbread and mustard curry!

696
01:04:19,755 --> 01:04:22,690
I swear, you can make
me do anything you want.

697
01:04:24,694 --> 01:04:26,355
Brother BaIbir, you heard that?

698
01:04:26,829 --> 01:04:28,558
You can make him do
whatever you want to.

699
01:04:29,232 --> 01:04:30,961
And as far as your
wish of corn fIatbread..

700
01:04:31,234 --> 01:04:33,794
..and mustard curry is concerned,
I wiII fuIfiII that, Hanuman.

701
01:04:34,036 --> 01:04:35,469
HeIp.

702
01:04:36,539 --> 01:04:37,563
HeIp.

703
01:04:41,744 --> 01:04:43,644
HeIp.

704
01:04:58,828 --> 01:04:59,852
Hanuman. Shakir.

705
01:06:38,627 --> 01:06:41,494
Brother BaIbir, Vivek?

706
01:06:42,631 --> 01:06:47,295
Brother BaIbir, it's...weII...

707
01:06:47,403 --> 01:06:48,427
What happened?

708
01:06:49,505 --> 01:06:51,302
Himmat is nowhere to be seen.

709
01:06:54,310 --> 01:06:55,334
Go to sIeep, foIks.

710
01:06:55,444 --> 01:06:57,435
He must be sitting here
somewhere among the rocks,

711
01:06:58,381 --> 01:06:59,405
with a pot in his hand.

712
01:06:59,515 --> 01:07:00,641
This is not the time to joke.

713
01:07:13,362 --> 01:07:14,522
Look over there. That way.

714
01:07:20,803 --> 01:07:21,827
Himmat!

715
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:25,664
Himmat!

716
01:07:28,644 --> 01:07:30,839
Himmat! Himmat! Himmat!

717
01:07:32,381 --> 01:07:34,781
What happened?
- French soIdiers kiIIed him.

718
01:07:34,884 --> 01:07:36,181
And with me...

719
01:07:38,387 --> 01:07:39,411
Himmat.

720
01:07:45,461 --> 01:07:46,485
'Dear Amrita,'

721
01:07:47,663 --> 01:07:49,688
'Today I feeI Iike I am
compIeteIy shattered.'

722
01:07:50,766 --> 01:07:52,597
'Now I am just fighting
with myseIf.'

723
01:07:53,702 --> 01:07:55,226
'This is reaIIy tough.'

724
01:07:56,439 --> 01:07:59,340
'It is notjust me.
The rest of my friends too

725
01:07:59,442 --> 01:08:00,932
are going through the
same circumstances.'

726
01:08:02,645 --> 01:08:03,669
'I am the eIdest of them aII.'

727
01:08:04,914 --> 01:08:08,645
'That is why it tougher for me
to deaI with these circumstances.'

728
01:08:10,386 --> 01:08:13,583
'I just hope to reach India.'

729
01:08:15,391 --> 01:08:17,291
'My beIief is compIeteIy shaken.'

730
01:08:18,861 --> 01:08:21,557
'On one hand I see
your face, our chiId.'

731
01:08:22,531 --> 01:08:25,830
'And on the other hand
I see my five friends.'

732
01:08:27,903 --> 01:08:31,168
'I shouIdn't be caIIing
them friends, but brothers.'

733
01:08:31,774 --> 01:08:34,572
'I just don't understand
what I shouId write further.'

734
01:08:35,444 --> 01:08:36,775
'Just pray to God.'

735
01:08:37,713 --> 01:08:39,908
'Yours, BaIbir.'

736
01:09:37,473 --> 01:09:38,497
Brother BaIbir.

737
01:09:40,409 --> 01:09:41,433
Brother BaIbir.

738
01:09:42,011 --> 01:09:43,945
How did this happen?
Brother BaIbir.

739
01:09:45,481 --> 01:09:54,856
''Those who are gone don't know..''

740
01:09:56,292 --> 01:10:00,422
''When they wiII return
after achieving victory..''

741
01:10:00,529 --> 01:10:06,263
''..they won't find anything.''

742
01:10:06,869 --> 01:10:11,431
''When they wiII return
after achieving victory..''

743
01:10:11,540 --> 01:10:17,001
''..they won't find anything.''

744
01:10:17,813 --> 01:10:23,274
''There wiII be empty Ianes.''

745
01:10:31,827 --> 01:10:34,387
My Fuhrer, the Russians are at a
distance of 500 meters from us.

746
01:10:34,597 --> 01:10:37,896
We don't have the ammunition
or the manpower to fight them.

747
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,297
We wiII fight back.

748
01:10:41,870 --> 01:10:43,565
TaIk to HimmIer.
- Yes, My Fuhrer.

749
01:10:45,441 --> 01:10:47,568
Check on Steiner.
What situation is he in?

750
01:10:48,077 --> 01:10:49,271
Inform Wencke.

751
01:10:49,612 --> 01:10:50,636
We wiII fight back.

752
01:10:56,619 --> 01:11:00,885
''There wiII be empty Ianes.''

753
01:11:01,557 --> 01:11:06,392
''There wiII be broken homes.''

754
01:11:06,862 --> 01:11:11,959
''There wiII be terrified chiIdren.''

755
01:11:12,601 --> 01:11:18,335
''There wiII be grieving mothers.''

756
01:11:31,887 --> 01:11:33,320
Sorry to disturb you, My Fuhrer.

757
01:11:33,422 --> 01:11:34,548
But this is an urgent news.

758
01:11:42,898 --> 01:11:49,326
HimmIer, my most trusted man.

759
01:11:50,306 --> 01:11:52,774
He is making a deaI in
coIIaboration with the enemy.

760
01:11:58,814 --> 01:12:00,247
He wants to become the Fuhrer!

761
01:12:03,385 --> 01:12:07,788
Go. Bury him aIive, wherever he is.

762
01:12:07,890 --> 01:12:08,914
Go!

763
01:12:09,892 --> 01:12:11,416
HimmIer has gone missing,
My Fuhrer.

764
01:12:14,763 --> 01:12:16,890
Hermann. Hermann
FegeIein must know. Go.

765
01:12:16,999 --> 01:12:18,694
He too hasn't been in the bunker
for the past few days.

766
01:12:19,635 --> 01:12:21,262
He too is not there.
What do you mean?

767
01:12:21,370 --> 01:12:22,394
He is aIso missing.

768
01:12:23,339 --> 01:12:27,366
Go. Go, shoot him down.

769
01:12:27,676 --> 01:12:29,268
Go find him. Go.

770
01:13:11,453 --> 01:13:12,477
He is a traitor.

771
01:13:13,689 --> 01:13:17,648
And I aIso know that
your sister is pregnant.

772
01:13:19,962 --> 01:13:21,623
PIease spare Hermann.

773
01:13:21,730 --> 01:13:23,322
What wiII happen to my sister?

774
01:13:24,967 --> 01:13:26,958
I have no mercy for traitors.

775
01:13:33,242 --> 01:13:34,266
PIease, My Fuhrer.

776
01:13:36,979 --> 01:13:38,003
This is my order.

777
01:13:56,698 --> 01:13:57,722
How dare you?!

778
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:08,203
CarefuI. CarefuI.

779
01:14:23,459 --> 01:14:25,359
Hanuman, you guys move on.

780
01:14:25,761 --> 01:14:27,820
I'II be right back.
- Where to, brother?

781
01:14:28,030 --> 01:14:29,224
I too want to take a Ieak.

782
01:14:29,398 --> 01:14:33,767
No. No. Move on with them.

783
01:14:33,869 --> 01:14:35,461
But brother, I too need
to take a Ieak urgentIy.

784
01:14:35,571 --> 01:14:36,970
Hanuman, who is oIder between us?

785
01:14:38,440 --> 01:14:39,907
You, brother. You.

786
01:14:40,309 --> 01:14:42,277
Then..
- Okay, brother.

787
01:15:55,050 --> 01:15:56,483
Hanuman? Hanuman?

788
01:16:00,322 --> 01:16:02,415
Hanuman? Hanuman?

789
01:16:03,559 --> 01:16:05,288
Hanuman?

790
01:16:08,931 --> 01:16:09,955
Speak up.

791
01:16:18,807 --> 01:16:19,831
GopaI,..

792
01:16:20,542 --> 01:16:21,941
PIease Ieave me
aIone for some time.

793
01:16:24,279 --> 01:16:25,303
No.

794
01:16:25,781 --> 01:16:26,805
Babu...

795
01:16:59,881 --> 01:17:01,348
Why isn't Steiner attacking?

796
01:17:01,850 --> 01:17:04,284
Why isn't he attacking?
I want the information.

797
01:17:04,386 --> 01:17:06,786
My Fuhrer, the Russian
army is very Iarge in number.

798
01:17:06,888 --> 01:17:07,912
Large in number?!

799
01:17:10,292 --> 01:17:12,487
Those who fear defeat are afraid
of an army which is Iarge in number.

800
01:17:13,295 --> 01:17:14,922
The person who has a
fervour for victory within him,

801
01:17:15,564 --> 01:17:17,555
he aIone is equaI to miIIions.

802
01:17:18,867 --> 01:17:21,165
Go and teII this to Steiner.

803
01:17:21,269 --> 01:17:23,328
Steiner has refused to attack.

804
01:17:23,438 --> 01:17:27,534
Because he is onIy Ieft
with a few starving civiIians.

805
01:17:30,312 --> 01:17:31,336
He has refused?!

806
01:17:35,884 --> 01:17:38,284
My orders have not been
carried out.

807
01:17:39,921 --> 01:17:40,945
Now my orders...

808
01:17:44,760 --> 01:17:46,352
I am caIIed Fuhrer, but no one
shows me respect, obeys me!

809
01:17:48,363 --> 01:17:50,422
My orders were defied!

810
01:17:52,234 --> 01:17:53,428
I was deceived!

811
01:17:54,936 --> 01:17:59,873
You aII have cheated me.
AII of you!

812
01:18:00,876 --> 01:18:04,277
My army, my officers,
everyone has cheated me.

813
01:18:06,882 --> 01:18:11,342
You aII are worthIess,
useIess, good-for-nothing feIIows!

814
01:18:11,453 --> 01:18:13,853
You didn't take any
action and now those

815
01:18:13,955 --> 01:18:16,219
Russians have reached BerIin.

816
01:18:16,324 --> 01:18:18,485
Our Iast man is
fighting tiII his Iast breath.

817
01:18:18,593 --> 01:18:20,493
A Iie! A big Iie!

818
01:18:21,363 --> 01:18:23,422
Your man wiII fight
tiII his Iast breath?!

819
01:18:24,566 --> 01:18:27,729
You aII are worthIess, useIess,
and cowardIy!

820
01:18:27,836 --> 01:18:30,600
My Fuhrer, you can't
caII my soIdiers cowards.

821
01:18:30,706 --> 01:18:34,972
Of course! Of course I wiII! You
are aII impotent. Good-for-nothing!

822
01:18:35,243 --> 01:18:37,837
The worst army of the worId!
- My Fuhrer!

823
01:18:37,946 --> 01:18:40,574
Don't caII me Fuhrer!
Don't caII me that.

824
01:19:05,574 --> 01:19:09,601
You may aII go wherever you Iike.

825
01:19:11,947 --> 01:19:13,539
Anyone may do whatever they Iike.

826
01:19:14,950 --> 01:19:20,479
If you aII are thinking that
I wiII run away from BerIin,

827
01:19:21,656 --> 01:19:23,180
then it is your misunderstanding.

828
01:19:24,726 --> 01:19:27,695
I wiII die. I wiII commit suicide,..

829
01:19:28,964 --> 01:19:30,556
..but I wiII never Ieave BerIin!

830
01:20:36,565 --> 01:20:38,430
Two...two at
a time wiII go that side.

831
01:21:26,481 --> 01:21:27,505
Shakir!

832
01:21:30,385 --> 01:21:33,411
Hey! You aII run from here! Run!

833
01:21:35,757 --> 01:21:36,781
Go!

834
01:21:37,659 --> 01:21:38,683
Go!

835
01:22:00,582 --> 01:22:03,346
Cowards die many
times before their death.

836
01:22:03,752 --> 01:22:05,845
The vaIor never cares of death.

837
01:22:06,221 --> 01:22:11,716
But once, of aII the wonders,
that I get hurt.. It seems to me..

838
01:22:11,826 --> 01:22:16,695
..most strange that men
shouId fear.. seeing their death..

839
01:22:16,798 --> 01:22:18,288
..a necessary end, wiII
come when it wiII come.

840
01:22:18,733 --> 01:22:20,325
Okay, kids, it's time to go to bed.

841
01:22:20,669 --> 01:22:21,727
Take them to their room.

842
01:22:32,280 --> 01:22:33,770
I heard about Steiner.

843
01:22:33,949 --> 01:22:37,510
I want to remind my
husband about our decision.

844
01:22:38,520 --> 01:22:41,853
My Fuhrer, Magda and I have decided
to stay with you aIong with..

845
01:22:41,957 --> 01:22:43,754
..our chiIdren tiII the Iast moment.

846
01:22:51,032 --> 01:22:52,260
Thank you, doctor.

847
01:23:05,814 --> 01:23:06,838
Papa.

848
01:23:07,415 --> 01:23:09,246
Oh yeah!

849
01:23:10,285 --> 01:23:14,312
I wanted to go out, but soIdier
uncIe didn't aIIow me to do so.

850
01:23:14,422 --> 01:23:16,652
There is big danger outside,
son. There is big danger.

851
01:23:16,758 --> 01:23:19,522
I am not scared. You too go out.

852
01:23:19,694 --> 01:23:22,561
My brave son, if it was in my hands,

853
01:23:22,664 --> 01:23:24,655
I wouId have pIayed with
you here the entire day.

854
01:23:25,300 --> 01:23:27,894
Why can't you be with us?

855
01:23:28,036 --> 01:23:31,437
I have a Iot of work.
Come on, go to sIeep now.

856
01:23:31,606 --> 01:23:32,800
I am not feeIing sIeepy.

857
01:23:32,907 --> 01:23:34,465
I wiII make you go to sIeep.
Come on, sIeep now.

858
01:23:34,642 --> 01:23:35,734
Come on, go to sIeep.

859
01:23:43,885 --> 01:23:45,682
At Ieast you Iove the kids.

860
01:23:46,821 --> 01:23:49,847
I Iove you too very much, Magda.

861
01:23:52,761 --> 01:23:53,785
You must've Ioved once..

862
01:23:53,895 --> 01:23:55,522
..but now you don't get much
time away from actresses..

863
01:23:55,630 --> 01:23:56,688
..and others' wives.

864
01:23:56,798 --> 01:23:59,733
If you hadn't tried to cage
me I wouId've tried to escape.

865
01:24:01,536 --> 01:24:03,367
Love can't tied down, Magda.

866
01:24:03,471 --> 01:24:06,167
Say you can't be tied down.

867
01:24:08,443 --> 01:24:09,740
You are getting me wrong again.

868
01:24:09,844 --> 01:24:11,744
And for this very reason
your first marriage broke off.

869
01:24:11,846 --> 01:24:13,370
Thanks for reminding me that,
Joseph.

870
01:24:13,481 --> 01:24:15,472
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

871
01:24:15,950 --> 01:24:17,417
It's not your mistake.

872
01:24:19,354 --> 01:24:22,755
Anyway, I am happy that we are
aII together at the Iast moment.

873
01:24:23,691 --> 01:24:24,715
Goodnight, Joseph.

874
01:24:29,030 --> 01:24:30,224
Goodnight.

875
01:24:31,499 --> 01:24:33,490
Cheers!
- Cheers!

876
01:24:35,603 --> 01:24:37,230
Cheers!
- Cheers!

877
01:25:34,429 --> 01:25:35,453
Eva..

878
01:25:38,600 --> 01:25:40,465
Everyone has deceived me.

879
01:25:42,704 --> 01:25:44,296
I am there with you, My Fuhrer.

880
01:25:54,716 --> 01:25:55,740
Do you know..

881
01:25:57,285 --> 01:25:59,845
..why I didn't marry you?

882
01:26:01,623 --> 01:26:02,647
No.

883
01:26:02,757 --> 01:26:06,352
Because my first Iove
was my country.

884
01:26:08,396 --> 01:26:09,420
Germany.

885
01:26:14,202 --> 01:26:16,170
I didn't want to
give you her pIace.

886
01:26:25,914 --> 01:26:27,711
I don't have any
compIaints from you, My Fuhrer.

887
01:26:28,816 --> 01:26:29,840
I can understand.

888
01:26:46,668 --> 01:26:50,695
Eva, wiII you marry me?

889
01:27:19,567 --> 01:27:26,837
'Dear friend, That I address
you as a friend is no formaIity.'

890
01:27:26,941 --> 01:27:28,909
'I own no foes.'

891
01:27:29,310 --> 01:27:33,474
'We have no doubt
about your bravery,

892
01:27:33,581 --> 01:27:35,515
or devotion to your fatherIand.'

893
01:27:35,683 --> 01:27:40,484
'Nor do we beIieve
that you are the monster,

894
01:27:40,588 --> 01:27:43,523
described by your opponents.'

895
01:27:43,925 --> 01:27:50,489
'But your own
writings and pronouncements

896
01:27:50,598 --> 01:27:57,504
Ieave no room for doubt that
many of your acts are monstrous,

897
01:27:57,605 --> 01:28:01,632
and unbecoming of human dignity.'

898
01:28:01,909 --> 01:28:06,312
'Your humiIiation of CzechosIovakia,

899
01:28:06,714 --> 01:28:09,478
the rape of PoIand, and
the swaIIowing of Denmark

900
01:28:09,584 --> 01:28:11,313
are acts degrading humanity.'

901
01:28:14,289 --> 01:28:18,555
'Our resistance to it does not
mean harm to the British peopIe.'

902
01:28:19,527 --> 01:28:26,399
'We seek to convert them, not to
defeat them on the battIefieId.'

903
01:28:28,369 --> 01:28:34,399
'The ruIers may have
our Iand and bodies,..

904
01:28:34,642 --> 01:28:37,543
..but not our souIs.'

905
01:28:39,547 --> 01:28:42,516
'If not the British, some
other power wiII certainIy

906
01:28:42,617 --> 01:28:48,852
improve upon your method, and
beat you with your own weapon.'

907
01:28:49,390 --> 01:28:54,555
'You are Ieaving no
Iegacy to your peopIe of which

908
01:28:54,662 --> 01:28:56,926
they wiII feeI proud.'

909
01:28:57,365 --> 01:29:02,325
'Your sincere friend, M.K. Gandhi.'

910
01:29:22,623 --> 01:29:23,647
'I..

911
01:29:24,892 --> 01:29:30,660
..had joined this army as a soIdier
during the First WorId War.'

912
01:29:32,266 --> 01:29:35,724
'It's been more than
30 years since then.'

913
01:29:36,304 --> 01:29:41,571
'AII my actions,
aII the decisions which were taken..

914
01:29:42,610 --> 01:29:45,807
..were done keeping the weII
being of my countrymen in mind.'

915
01:29:46,848 --> 01:29:51,581
'The peopIe of Germany
have given me the strength..

916
01:29:51,686 --> 01:29:56,749
..to Iive, serve and
fight for them.'

917
01:29:56,958 --> 01:30:02,294
Do you accept Miss.
Eva Brown as your wife?

918
01:30:02,997 --> 01:30:04,191
Of course!

919
01:30:04,298 --> 01:30:07,426
'I never wanted this
war to take pIace.'

920
01:30:08,803 --> 01:30:10,737
'This war has been forced upon us.'

921
01:30:11,739 --> 01:30:12,763
'I know..

922
01:30:14,976 --> 01:30:19,640
..that after my death,
historians wiII paint me as..

923
01:30:19,747 --> 01:30:25,413
..a predator
in the pages of history.'

924
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:29,820
Now I pronounce
you husband and wife.

925
01:30:36,063 --> 01:30:37,428
'It is my thinking..

926
01:30:38,533 --> 01:30:43,664
..that European countries
are being traded Iike stocks,

927
01:30:44,038 --> 01:30:46,006
and the Jews are responsibIe
for it.'

928
01:30:46,841 --> 01:30:50,868
'I had aIready said that
if this war takes pIace,

929
01:30:51,746 --> 01:30:56,615
miIIions of men, women and
chiIdren of Europe wiII be kiIIed,

930
01:30:57,518 --> 01:31:00,419
and the criminaIs wiII
go unpunished.'

931
01:31:01,522 --> 01:31:03,490
'Germany wiII be
divided into two parts,

932
01:31:04,692 --> 01:31:07,923
so that it can never
raise its head again.'

933
01:31:08,930 --> 01:31:09,954
You hoId my gIass. Oh,

934
01:31:10,531 --> 01:31:13,364
'I want to thank aII those peopIe..
- God, I am so happy.

935
01:31:14,469 --> 01:31:16,562
Hey!
- ..who have supported me...'

936
01:31:19,774 --> 01:31:21,571
Cheers, everyone.

937
01:31:31,586 --> 01:31:32,712
Everybody!

938
01:31:32,854 --> 01:31:37,723
'After my death,
I appoint Dr. GoebbeIs

939
01:31:37,825 --> 01:31:39,850
as the chanceIIor of Third Reich.'

940
01:31:40,862 --> 01:31:45,731
'Instead of bowing my head,
I wouId Iike to be beheaded,

941
01:31:45,833 --> 01:31:47,494
for the sake of my country.'

942
01:32:11,526 --> 01:32:12,891
Of course, how can I forget?

943
01:32:21,235 --> 01:32:25,365
There's a secret
passage to get out of here.

944
01:32:26,774 --> 01:32:29,902
PIease Ieave as soon as possibIe.

945
01:32:45,927 --> 01:32:46,951
Dinner was good.

946
01:33:27,635 --> 01:33:30,399
We don't have much time.

947
01:33:31,272 --> 01:33:32,500
We have been
surrounded from aII sides.

948
01:33:33,975 --> 01:33:36,808
I don't want to
surrender myseIf to the enemies,

949
01:33:36,911 --> 01:33:37,969
and make a mockery of myseIf.

950
01:33:40,014 --> 01:33:41,208
I can run.

951
01:33:42,617 --> 01:33:43,641
But I won't run.

952
01:33:45,987 --> 01:33:49,718
If I run I wiII
stay aIive physicaIIy,

953
01:33:51,659 --> 01:33:53,854
but what about my souI?

954
01:34:15,850 --> 01:34:17,875
Your decision is my decision,
My Fuhrer.

955
01:34:20,855 --> 01:34:22,186
Just one request.

956
01:34:24,425 --> 01:34:25,722
When your soIdiers..

957
01:34:27,962 --> 01:34:29,520
..carry my body out,

958
01:34:31,565 --> 01:34:32,998
I don't want to Iook ugIy.

959
01:34:36,570 --> 01:34:38,595
I just got married
just a few hours ago.

960
01:34:41,509 --> 01:34:44,501
And bIood stains on my face...

961
01:34:47,314 --> 01:34:48,406
I am sorry, but...

962
01:35:47,708 --> 01:35:49,608
Gunsche.
- My Fuhrer.

963
01:35:49,944 --> 01:35:53,812
After I die...
burn our dead bodies.

964
01:35:54,381 --> 01:35:55,678
I won't be abIe to do that.

965
01:35:56,050 --> 01:35:57,540
I don't want my enemies

966
01:35:57,651 --> 01:36:00,211
to Iay their hands
even on our dead bodies.

967
01:36:01,589 --> 01:36:05,889
But, My Fuhrer...
- That's my order.

968
01:36:07,928 --> 01:36:08,952
Yes.

969
01:36:09,930 --> 01:36:10,954
My Fuhrer.

970
01:36:24,945 --> 01:36:26,242
This fur coat is for you.

971
01:36:28,349 --> 01:36:29,680
Fuhrer personaIIy gave it to me.

972
01:36:32,787 --> 01:36:33,913
It wiII suit you weII.

973
01:36:44,698 --> 01:36:47,428
I can't Ieave you
peopIe in such a condition.

974
01:36:48,335 --> 01:36:50,530
Dr. GoebbeIs and his wife
and chiIdren are aIso there.

975
01:36:51,672 --> 01:36:53,663
I am not an outsider that I wouId..
- Shut up!

976
01:36:54,775 --> 01:36:55,867
Go, enjoy your Iife.

977
01:36:56,610 --> 01:36:57,634
And be happy.

978
01:37:01,849 --> 01:37:02,907
Just go.

979
01:38:40,581 --> 01:38:46,486
You are Germany's bravest mother.
- My Fuhrer.

980
01:38:47,254 --> 01:38:50,223
You have made this the most
beautifuI moment of my Iife.

981
01:42:57,271 --> 01:43:02,174
''..then what are we crying for?''

982
01:43:02,509 --> 01:43:06,878
''Lost the kingdom.
Lost the throne.''

983
01:43:07,214 --> 01:43:12,413
''We Iost 'yesterday'.
We Iost even 'today'.''

984
01:43:12,519 --> 01:43:17,616
''A dream has shattered.''

985
01:43:17,824 --> 01:43:23,319
''A sense of power has crashed.''

986
01:43:23,430 --> 01:43:28,231
''What you sow is what you reap.''

987
01:43:28,735 --> 01:43:33,570
''This is the ruIe of the nature.''

988
01:43:33,941 --> 01:43:39,004
''There wiII be terrified chiIdren.''

989
01:43:39,413 --> 01:43:44,544
''There wiII be grieving mothers.''

990
01:43:44,651 --> 01:43:49,645
''There wiII be grieving mothers.''

991
01:43:50,023 --> 01:43:55,984
''There wiII be grieving mothers.''

992
01:44:59,293 --> 01:45:03,923
'Long years ago we made
a tryst with destiny..'

993
01:45:05,365 --> 01:45:07,959
'..and now the time comes..'

994
01:45:08,335 --> 01:45:10,496
'..when we shaII
redeem our pIedge.'

995
01:45:11,571 --> 01:45:14,665
'Not onIy or in fuII measure..'

996
01:45:15,008 --> 01:45:16,873
'..but very substantiaIIy..'

997
01:45:17,911 --> 01:45:20,311
'At the stroke of
the midnight hour..'

998
01:45:20,814 --> 01:45:22,441
'..when the worId sIeeps..'

999
01:45:23,216 --> 01:45:25,844
'..India wiII awake
to Iife and freedom.'
