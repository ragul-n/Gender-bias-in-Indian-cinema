1
00:01:38,164 --> 00:02:02,182
New spring season...
new spring season... 

2
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:07,858
Hyderabad city... 

3
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:12,564
A city that changes the fate of
people coming to seek refuge in it.

4
00:02:12,765 --> 00:02:17,202
Millions of young men come here
in search of future,

5
00:02:17,403 --> 00:02:21,032
with dreams, with imaginations,
and with great ambitions.

6
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:25,735
Every one wishes to win in life.
But only few manage to win.

7
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:30,743
How many had won is a secret
which only the seeker knows.

8
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:35,182
But the number of seekers
never dwindles, they keep coming,

9
00:02:35,588 --> 00:02:38,318
one such youth seeking
success is Ganesh.

10
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:43,053
He has come in search of his life
with a heart filled with love.

11
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:45,026
Sir, please guide me
to this address.

12
00:03:02,815 --> 00:03:07,081
Excuse me sir, can you tell me
if I'm at right address?

13
00:03:09,722 --> 00:03:10,814
Yes, but what's the matter?

14
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:13,584
My name is Ganesh,
native of Ramapuram,

15
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:16,893
I came to meet my maternal uncle.
-Are you boss' nephew?

16
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:17,892
Yes sir.

17
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:19,491
You came at wrong time.

18
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:22,065
Nobody is at home,
they have all gone to Tirupathi.

19
00:03:23,169 --> 00:03:25,865
They'll be here by morning,
come back tomorrow.

20
00:03:29,475 --> 00:03:30,464
What son?

21
00:03:32,078 --> 00:03:33,010
Nothing sir.

22
00:03:33,846 --> 00:03:36,314
I don't know anyone here
other than my uncle,

23
00:03:38,751 --> 00:03:40,548
I don't have money too.

24
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:44,455
I'll stay somewhere here
till my uncle comes.

25
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:50,259
Okay.

26
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:20,216
BHAVANI

27
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,188
This is gross injustice sister,

28
00:04:22,395 --> 00:04:24,226
if you transfer your entire
property to my name,

29
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,658
what will your son have in future?

30
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:27,162
Did you give a thought about it?

31
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:30,032
Why do you speak like a stranger?

32
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:31,928
Are you any different from my son?

33
00:04:32,205 --> 00:04:34,196
If you succeed in life,
won't you take care of my son?

34
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:37,433
Then, send your son with me,

35
00:04:37,644 --> 00:04:39,737
I'll educate him well and make
him an engineer or a doctor.

36
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:42,244
First succeed in business
with this money,

37
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:43,540
after that your will and wish.

38
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:49,382
But never forget that your daughter should
become my daughter-in-law.

39
00:04:50,056 --> 00:04:51,353
Why are you insisting it sister?

40
00:04:51,557 --> 00:04:53,616
My daughter will become
your daughter-in-law,

41
00:04:53,826 --> 00:04:55,851
even if you don't accept her,
I'll not agree to it.

42
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:07,801
What are you thinking son?

43
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:09,272
Nothing sir.

44
00:05:09,742 --> 00:05:13,303
My mother wished for
my uncle's success,

45
00:05:14,113 --> 00:05:17,480
Uncle has succeeded in life
as my mother had wished.

46
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:21,281
But my mother is no more to see it.

47
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,888
Who is this girl?

48
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:28,923
This is Ammu.

49
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:31,487
Ammu?
-Yes, uncle's daughter.

50
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:33,495
Junior madam?

51
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:35,894
I've treasured all this
as her memorabilia.

52
00:05:36,102 --> 00:05:39,367
If I show it to her,
how happy she'll be.

53
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:43,505
How is Ammu now?
Is she as tall as me?

54
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,177
Isn't she fairer than me?

55
00:05:51,784 --> 00:05:57,279
She's a golden doll!
- Even if not, I'll marry Ammu only.

56
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:00,850
I've been observing you,
thinking about madam only,

57
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,391
don't you ever think of yourself?

58
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:06,661
You haven't eaten anything till now,
come, let's have food.

59
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:07,525
Come.

60
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:32,281
BHAVANI

61
00:06:34,427 --> 00:06:43,199
I saw... I saw... 

62
00:06:43,603 --> 00:06:47,562
I saw you in the moonlight... 

63
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:52,238
I saw... I saw... and
became your devotee... 

64
00:06:52,578 --> 00:07:00,815
I saw... I saw... 

65
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:14,896
I saw happiness in
the mischievous age... 

66
00:07:15,234 --> 00:07:19,330
I saw... I saw... 
I hid it in my heart... 

67
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:28,569
Amidst billions of stars,
you're my moon... 

68
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:37,989
Among millions of women,
Ammu, you're my only love... 

69
00:07:55,274 --> 00:07:58,141
Saw...? What did he see?

70
00:08:00,112 --> 00:08:02,342
Duet in dream?

71
00:08:15,761 --> 00:08:25,727
BHAVANI

72
00:08:39,752 --> 00:08:48,717
I saw... I saw... the heart that
wishes to be with you... 

73
00:08:48,928 --> 00:08:57,495
I saw my shadow going
to be with you... 

74
00:08:57,703 --> 00:09:02,003
I saw a beautiful world
without a third person... 

75
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:06,304
I saw your love too
not just you and me... 

76
00:09:06,512 --> 00:09:11,575
I saw myself as a new man
when you become a part of me... 

77
00:10:10,509 --> 00:10:19,383
I saw myriad of colours in the
bashfulness of a butterfly... 

78
00:10:19,585 --> 00:10:28,220
I saw and felt romance
in the breezing winds... 

79
00:10:28,427 --> 00:10:32,659
I saw a blooming beauty in
the gushing waterfalls... 

80
00:10:32,865 --> 00:10:36,995
I saw rhythm in the breath... 

81
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:42,231
I saw you as a rain drop
in the gentle rain... 

82
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:27,876
BHAVANI

83
00:11:49,842 --> 00:11:52,743
Oh God! I think boss has returned.

84
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:06,924
I missed her.

85
00:12:07,193 --> 00:12:07,989
Sir... 

86
00:12:08,627 --> 00:12:11,118
Any post for me?

87
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:14,662
No post sir but your nephew has come.

88
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:16,629
Nephew?
-Yes sir.

89
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:18,899
Where is he?
- He's sleeping inside.

90
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:20,866
In your place?
-Yes sir.

91
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:26,310
Uncle is coming,
let me act like I'm in sleep.

92
00:12:26,512 --> 00:12:27,638
Let me see his reaction.

93
00:12:46,365 --> 00:12:47,855
Who is he?
- Parvathi's son.

94
00:12:48,067 --> 00:12:49,659
Parvathi's son?

95
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:52,634
I was worried about a good gardener.

96
00:12:52,838 --> 00:12:55,807
Now, I've got one
who'll work for free.

97
00:12:57,443 --> 00:13:00,640
Don't talk silly, who are you
planning to make a gardener?

98
00:13:01,046 --> 00:13:05,676
His sudden arrival is with the
intention of marrying our daughter.

99
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:11,212
Our daughter doesn't even
know his existence.

100
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:15,257
If he meets her and
introduces himself as her fiancee?

101
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:16,792
Will you get her married to him?

102
00:13:18,397 --> 00:13:20,661
Even if we accept,
would our daughter accept it?

103
00:13:23,435 --> 00:13:25,665
He's no match to our daughter.

104
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,800
She's modern and he's country.

105
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:32,610
She's rich and he's poor.

106
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:39,880
Why are you inviting trouble that
you should drop like hot potato?

107
00:13:42,421 --> 00:13:44,286
We must nip it in bud.

108
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:51,420
Idiot! How dare you invite
strangers into the house?

109
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:54,531
I don't know what you do,
I mustn't see him by morning.

110
00:13:54,733 --> 00:13:56,792
If he's here, you'll not be here.

111
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:08,537
BHAVANI

112
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:17,815
Son... 

113
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:23,486
No sir, I came to the wrong address.

114
00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:29,089
This isn't my uncle's house,
somebody else lives here.

115
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:34,068
Bye sir.

116
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:38,537
Jr. Madam goes to college at 9 am,

117
00:14:38,944 --> 00:14:44,314
you can meet her outside
and talk to her once.

118
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:49,754
No please, if she too
despises me like my uncle,

119
00:14:50,656 --> 00:14:51,748
I can't bear it.

120
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:58,219
Uncle rejected me because I'm poor,

121
00:14:59,298 --> 00:15:02,233
I'll earn money,
I'll raise to his standard,

122
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:03,657
I'll come back then,

123
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:08,899
and face my Ammu bravely.

124
00:15:11,143 --> 00:15:15,546
Till then I'm happy with
the Ammu who lives in my heart.

125
00:15:33,832 --> 00:15:43,798
BHAVANI

126
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:50,047
This isn't a song of dream, my friend... 

127
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:52,809
It's a word from my heart... 

128
00:16:03,095 --> 00:16:05,461
There's a word of advice
in my song... 

129
00:16:05,664 --> 00:16:08,258
If you see it,
it's a heart warming thing... 

130
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:28,576
BHAVANI

131
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:51,809
Hey! House owner is coming!

132
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,743
Open the door boys!

133
00:16:58,283 --> 00:17:02,049
Open the door I say.
Are you in there?

134
00:17:04,056 --> 00:17:04,954
We are not in.

135
00:17:05,157 --> 00:17:08,649
I'm calling you,
are you in there or not?

136
00:17:15,134 --> 00:17:19,002
House owner! I'm Savithri here,

137
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:22,970
all three boys went out early morning,
I saw them going out.

138
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:27,042
Vijay, don't try to cheat me
by mimicking like Savithri.

139
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:29,106
I've come after seeing her
going to the temple,

140
00:17:29,314 --> 00:17:30,804
I'm warning you to open the door.

141
00:17:31,016 --> 00:17:32,847
You spoiled the show
with your mimicry,

142
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,952
go and open the door.

143
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:52,897
He's very young,
may be gone tired.

144
00:17:56,175 --> 00:17:58,040
Anyway you don't pay the rent,

145
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:00,107
won't you at least respect the owner?

146
00:18:01,113 --> 00:18:03,604
Bloody! How many times
should I knock the door?

147
00:18:04,349 --> 00:18:06,817
Sir, this is your house
and your door,

148
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:08,714
knock it as many times
as you like sir.

149
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:10,582
No fool can stop you.

150
00:18:11,523 --> 00:18:15,357
Can't pay the rent but
can unleash barbs at me.

151
00:18:15,694 --> 00:18:21,098
I must kick myself for letting
the house to fools like you.

152
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,824
You always say it but never do it.

153
00:18:23,702 --> 00:18:26,466
I'm shouting at the
top of the voice here,

154
00:18:26,705 --> 00:18:29,503
why are you silent like you're praying
for my soul to rest in peace?

155
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:30,470
Answer me.

156
00:18:31,977 --> 00:18:35,879
Who am I to stop if you kick
yourself for your mistake?

157
00:18:36,081 --> 00:18:36,911
Kick yourself sir.

158
00:18:40,986 --> 00:18:44,183
Stop this nonsense,
a boy I know will come now,

159
00:18:44,389 --> 00:18:46,584
he'll stay with you for few days.
Please adjust.

160
00:18:47,659 --> 00:18:49,354
We can't share room
with strangers.

161
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,563
Then, he'll stay here,
you vacate the place. - Impossible... 

162
00:18:52,998 --> 00:18:54,431
Who am I to tell you this?

163
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:56,191
This is your house,
you will and wish,

164
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:58,103
ask him to come.

165
00:18:59,838 --> 00:19:01,032
That's better!

166
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:07,078
You changed perfectly.

167
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:08,405
Do we have any other choice?

168
00:19:08,614 --> 00:19:10,377
Are we paying rent properly?

169
00:19:10,582 --> 00:19:13,210
May be its like this.
- How?

170
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:15,377
The man who enters
here for few days,

171
00:19:15,587 --> 00:19:20,081
he may throw us out and
settle here permanently.

172
00:19:22,027 --> 00:19:23,654
Would I accept it?

173
00:19:24,696 --> 00:19:26,687
For the loud sound from my mike... 

174
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:36,604
You are Raja... 
- He's our Ganesh!

175
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:41,009
Did he tell about you?
-Yes.

176
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:43,581
Come in, let's go and talk.

177
00:19:44,283 --> 00:19:46,012
When did you come to Hyderabad?
-Just now

178
00:19:46,218 --> 00:19:47,344
How are people back at home?
-All are fine.

179
00:19:47,553 --> 00:19:50,386
What brings you here?
- I came to meet my uncle.

180
00:19:50,956 --> 00:19:52,856
Do you've an uncle here?
-Yes.

181
00:19:53,058 --> 00:19:53,786
Did you meet him?

182
00:19:54,826 --> 00:19:59,092
No, I misplaced uncle's address.

183
00:19:59,631 --> 00:20:01,496
I don't have money too.

184
00:20:02,634 --> 00:20:03,896
I was confused.

185
00:20:04,803 --> 00:20:13,302
A man left me here to stay for days,
work, earn and go home.

186
00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:23,314
I was little jittery to stay with boys,

187
00:20:24,189 --> 00:20:27,590
but I'm very happy to see you all.

188
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:29,649
We too.

189
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:36,228
When did you all come to Hyderabad?

190
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:37,595
Why did you come here?

191
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,672
It's a long tale.

192
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:48,136
You fool! Still in bed at noon also?

193
00:20:48,347 --> 00:20:51,145
I don't know what sins have I
committed to get a son like you.

194
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:52,647
You useless!

195
00:20:53,218 --> 00:20:55,209
Where did you go last evening?

196
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:58,253
Didn't I tell you to come early
to see a marriage proposal?

197
00:20:58,457 --> 00:21:01,255
How many times I told you
I'll not marry now.

198
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:04,156
I must become a great singer,
everything else after that only.

199
00:21:04,963 --> 00:21:08,592
Can't earn a decent living but
dream about living in palace.

200
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:12,201
You must be clapping along
with the crowd,

201
00:21:12,404 --> 00:21:15,532
why do you desire to get
applauded for your talent?

202
00:21:15,741 --> 00:21:19,939
Till now I fed you like a bull,
it's useless to feed you anymore.

203
00:21:21,046 --> 00:21:23,014
You've a home to live
and food to eat,

204
00:21:23,215 --> 00:21:26,116
that's why you're dreaming
about becoming a singer,

205
00:21:26,318 --> 00:21:32,188
people like you will get sense when
you pick and clean leftovers.

206
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:36,418
Decide now, stay here as I wish
or go and beg on streets.

207
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:41,398
You must pay interest
correctly every month.

208
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,828
Okay madam.
- Go.

209
00:21:44,736 --> 00:21:48,365
Step mother, I had asked money
to pay college fees.

210
00:21:48,573 --> 00:21:50,200
Feeding you is burden to me,

211
00:21:50,409 --> 00:21:54,675
I may have to steal somewhere
to pay for your college fees.

212
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:56,547
Don't say like that,

213
00:21:56,748 --> 00:21:59,376
my only desire from
childhood is to do lAS,

214
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:00,778
please try to understand me.

215
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:03,716
Is your father here to earn for you?

216
00:22:03,922 --> 00:22:05,890
Is your mother here to cook for you?

217
00:22:06,091 --> 00:22:11,461
You free loader! Do you want
to become a Collector?

218
00:22:12,197 --> 00:22:14,893
Poor brother!
-Yes.

219
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:20,231
Enough of your studies.
Find some work and try to earn.

220
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:28,312
Are you going for a bath son?

221
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:33,079
New shampoo and soap,

222
00:22:33,285 --> 00:22:35,515
bath with them and
you'll become fragrant.

223
00:22:36,321 --> 00:22:39,017
Wear new clothes, you'll shine bright.

224
00:22:39,891 --> 00:22:40,983
Your pocket money,

225
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:43,354
enjoy an outing happily.
- Father... 

226
00:22:43,562 --> 00:22:45,553
But please don't come back to home.

227
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:48,257
What's this dad?

228
00:22:48,467 --> 00:22:53,302
I'm trying out new mimicry to have
my name entered in world records,

229
00:22:53,505 --> 00:22:56,303
why are you asking me
to lift bags in the shop?

230
00:22:56,508 --> 00:22:58,669
Record your name?

231
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:05,975
Go to any office and get your
name recorded there. That's enough!

232
00:23:07,486 --> 00:23:09,681
It's not just record,
but Guinness record.

233
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:13,881
It's a book the records
great achievements. Guinness book!

234
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:18,120
Silly boy! These day dreams ruin lives.

235
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:20,491
Record?
What great record will you create?

236
00:23:20,699 --> 00:23:22,257
Decide today,

237
00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:26,159
either you come to the shop with me,
or else you'll leave this home.

238
00:23:28,173 --> 00:23:30,198
If he comes to the shop with me,
serve him food,

239
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:34,436
otherwise feed it to the dog... 
feed it to the dog.

240
00:23:41,453 --> 00:23:43,921
Who scolded you?
Your parents.

241
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:45,814
Will you leave home for it?

242
00:23:46,224 --> 00:23:50,160
Not just parents,
every one made fun of us.

243
00:23:50,462 --> 00:23:51,986
How long could we tolerate it?

244
00:23:52,297 --> 00:23:53,821
One day a big trouble broke out.

245
00:23:54,299 --> 00:23:55,857
It reached police station too.

246
00:23:56,535 --> 00:23:59,561
Inspector refused to leave
unless our parents come there.

247
00:23:59,871 --> 00:24:03,602
Even goons' parents came and
took them home with affection.

248
00:24:03,909 --> 00:24:06,742
But do you know
what our parents said?

249
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:10,210
He made me hang my head in shame
boycotting the bride seeing ceremony,

250
00:24:10,415 --> 00:24:12,679
I'll never come the station
for such a son.

251
00:24:12,884 --> 00:24:14,044
Very happy to hear it.

252
00:24:14,252 --> 00:24:20,384
Please file fake charges on him and
put him in jail for few years,

253
00:24:20,592 --> 00:24:22,059
it'll save food expenses for me.

254
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:26,253
He's inviting trouble also
apart from being a free loader,

255
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:28,956
you arrested him, right?
You've done the right thing.

256
00:24:29,167 --> 00:24:30,361
Let him rot there.

257
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:36,240
Every time they chided us,
we thought they didn't like our ambition,

258
00:24:36,508 --> 00:24:37,873
but we came to know that day,

259
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:39,610
in fact they don't like us at all.

260
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:41,976
We decided then,

261
00:24:42,414 --> 00:24:44,939
if we want home,
we've to dance to their tunes,

262
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:48,415
if want to achieve our ambition,
we've to forget them like they have.

263
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:56,355
That's okay, do you've to
struggle like this for that?

264
00:24:58,296 --> 00:25:02,027
Do you feel we are struggling
looking at our room?

265
00:25:02,534 --> 00:25:05,162
Bachelors' rooms are like
this only in Hyderabad.

266
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:07,995
We are very happy here.

267
00:25:08,206 --> 00:25:10,231
We'll hit big time in near future.

268
00:25:10,442 --> 00:25:12,171
Do you know the music director
he's working for? - Who?

269
00:25:12,377 --> 00:25:15,369
Great Lahari.

270
00:25:15,614 --> 00:25:19,550
Yes, he has only one assistant,
I'm right and left hand.

271
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:26,384
He's studying in college,
after exams he'll go for lAS training.

272
00:25:29,127 --> 00:25:33,325
Prasad, you'll not write exams
if you don't pay fee by month end.

273
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:36,865
Yes, after finishing exams,
I can go to lAS training.

274
00:25:37,135 --> 00:25:39,433
Forget about them,
what about you?

275
00:25:40,639 --> 00:25:43,301
He's trying to enter
Guninness record books.

276
00:25:46,311 --> 00:25:48,802
I'm really happy,

277
00:25:49,247 --> 00:25:51,943
when I heard first about you,
it was sad to hear,

278
00:25:52,417 --> 00:25:56,217
but what I heard now is really
encouraging and happy.

279
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:01,958
It's time for my college,
I'll leave now.

280
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,821
He too is getting late to studio.

281
00:26:04,029 --> 00:26:09,126
You bath and take rest,
we'll meet in the evening. Okay? Bye.

282
00:26:09,367 --> 00:26:11,801
Take the keys, you needn't go
to village immediately,

283
00:26:12,003 --> 00:26:17,737
stay back, take a tour of Hyderabad
and then go, okay? Okay, bye.

284
00:26:18,109 --> 00:26:21,943
Bathroom is in downstairs,
go and take bath.

285
00:26:22,213 --> 00:26:23,840
Let's meet in the evening.
- Okay.

286
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:34,882
BHAVANI

287
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:39,087
Go!

288
00:26:41,232 --> 00:26:43,393
He really thinks his pant is torn.

289
00:26:43,868 --> 00:26:44,857
You're shameless!

290
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:49,871
I'm feeling sad for lying
to a childhood friend,

291
00:26:50,075 --> 00:26:51,099
why are you laughing now?

292
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:52,542
What's wrong in it?

293
00:26:53,378 --> 00:26:57,144
Did you see the glow of happiness
on his face when I lied?

294
00:26:58,717 --> 00:27:03,279
He mustn't know we
are struggling here.

295
00:27:03,555 --> 00:27:06,422
He'll feel very sad
if he comes to know.

296
00:27:09,928 --> 00:27:10,519
True.

297
00:27:10,729 --> 00:27:15,962
We must play this drama
till he returns to village. Okay?

298
00:27:16,434 --> 00:27:17,059
Come... 

299
00:27:17,402 --> 00:27:20,235
He said he doesn't have money.

300
00:27:20,438 --> 00:27:22,406
We left him alone in the room.

301
00:27:22,607 --> 00:27:24,040
How about his lunch?

302
00:27:27,912 --> 00:27:28,879
How much you've?

303
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:32,646
You...?

304
00:27:33,118 --> 00:27:34,312
I don't have anything.

305
00:27:34,586 --> 00:27:36,019
How will you go to the college?

306
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:38,220
I'll walk to the college.

307
00:27:38,423 --> 00:27:41,324
How many times I told you to ask
me money if you don't have it?

308
00:27:43,428 --> 00:27:43,894
Keep this.

309
00:27:44,596 --> 00:27:45,824
He's always hesitant to ask.

310
00:27:46,031 --> 00:27:48,295
Okay, you carry on,
I'll give money to Ganesh.

311
00:27:49,134 --> 00:27:52,365
You go to college, I've important work,
let's meet in the evening.

312
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:53,798
What's that important work?

313
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:57,236
It'll not materialize if I tell,
I'll tell after it succeeds. Come.

314
00:27:57,442 --> 00:28:01,435
Sorry pal, you don't have money,
keep this.

315
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,108
No problem.
- Take it.

316
00:28:03,314 --> 00:28:06,340
There's a small mess near by,
eat there today.

317
00:28:06,618 --> 00:28:09,109
Okay.
- Okay, bye.

318
00:28:15,794 --> 00:28:20,424
Lord, you gave me hope by
showing up friends in distress,

319
00:28:21,132 --> 00:28:26,832
you must bless me with success
to stand up to my uncle.

320
00:28:28,006 --> 00:28:32,272
Director said camera stops on the mole
at heroine's navel in the BGM.

321
00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:36,140
So I too stopped the music on it.

322
00:28:36,414 --> 00:28:38,939
We both had the same thought.

323
00:28:40,485 --> 00:28:42,783
Can't you bend down to
offer the tea, my King?

324
00:28:46,524 --> 00:28:49,322
They enter industry to rule over it.

325
00:28:52,664 --> 00:28:53,995
Let's decide after the mole.

326
00:28:54,199 --> 00:28:55,496
Mimicry language?

327
00:28:56,034 --> 00:28:58,832
I know Manik Basha,
what's this mimicry language?

328
00:28:59,037 --> 00:29:02,165
My name is Vijay,
I'm a good mimicry artiste.

329
00:29:02,373 --> 00:29:04,534
I'm Megastar in mimicry.

330
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:06,142
That's why I got this title.
- Who gave it?

331
00:29:06,678 --> 00:29:07,440
Myself!

332
00:29:08,346 --> 00:29:09,506
When?

333
00:29:09,714 --> 00:29:10,442
Just now!

334
00:29:12,884 --> 00:29:15,614
I make people go mad
with my acting.

335
00:29:16,187 --> 00:29:17,085
Do it.

336
00:29:17,288 --> 00:29:20,519
If you cut just because it's a twig,
I'll cut your throat.

337
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:21,957
This is Chiranjeevi.

338
00:29:22,527 --> 00:29:26,361
I've come to your house, your hall,
if you're a man, face me.

339
00:29:26,698 --> 00:29:27,756
This is Balakrishna.

340
00:29:28,199 --> 00:29:31,259
One shot and top and
bottom will get blown.

341
00:29:31,469 --> 00:29:32,493
This is Nagarjuna.

342
00:29:32,704 --> 00:29:33,170
How is it sir?

343
00:29:33,371 --> 00:29:35,999
The originals are there to do this,
why do I need a fake?

344
00:29:36,207 --> 00:29:37,936
Show me your real talent.

345
00:29:38,143 --> 00:29:40,839
Tell me your choice sir,
action or comedy?

346
00:29:41,045 --> 00:29:43,377
I'm fed up with your comedy,
now some action please.

347
00:29:46,885 --> 00:29:52,187
Hey Chieftain!
Change your judgement!

348
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:55,382
I'm here but why are you
facing the other side?

349
00:29:55,593 --> 00:29:57,584
I'm facing camera to
deliver the dialogue,

350
00:29:57,796 --> 00:30:00,162
only then I'll get spontaneous
response from audience.

351
00:30:00,665 --> 00:30:01,859
I don't see any.

352
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:05,968
You give me one chance sir,
I'll make entire Andhra come after me.

353
00:30:06,171 --> 00:30:06,865
What if I refuse?

354
00:30:07,071 --> 00:30:09,301
I'll make entire Andhra come after you.

355
00:30:09,674 --> 00:30:10,299
Why?

356
00:30:10,508 --> 00:30:12,874
To ask why you denied me a chance?

357
00:30:13,077 --> 00:30:14,601
Are you threatening me?

358
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:18,909
No sir, over confidence.

359
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:22,619
Seeking film chance has
become a silly thing

360
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:25,415
Okay, show me your talent.

361
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:37,230
Hey Chieftain!
Change your judgement!

362
00:30:37,435 --> 00:30:42,634
You cheated public with
your wrong judgements,

363
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:48,746
My name is fire, anyone touching
me will be reduced to ash.

364
00:30:48,947 --> 00:30:52,974
Got it?

365
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:58,451
If I book him as hero, I can make it in
multi languages without dubbing it.

366
00:30:58,656 --> 00:31:01,989
Hey Chieftain!
Change your judgement!

367
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:03,956
If you don't listen to me,

368
00:31:04,162 --> 00:31:08,599
I'll stab you with sword,
fire with gun,

369
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:12,759
poison you, and hang you to death,

370
00:31:12,971 --> 00:31:15,804
you bloody idiot!

371
00:31:20,311 --> 00:31:23,508
I'm crying without using glycerin.

372
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:26,047
I think sentiment will also
work out very well.

373
00:31:26,584 --> 00:31:30,645
It has entered 7 centimeters,
how can I not cry?

374
00:31:30,855 --> 00:31:32,049
What are you saying?

375
00:31:32,323 --> 00:31:36,783
I stabbed the knife into my brief
in an emotional outburst.

376
00:31:37,161 --> 00:31:38,628
I need to got to hospital urgently,

377
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:41,298
bye sir.
- Hey return my knife.

378
00:31:41,699 --> 00:31:43,633
I can't take out the knife,

379
00:31:43,835 --> 00:31:47,134
I'll have it couriered after
removing in an operation.

380
00:31:47,338 --> 00:31:53,436
Till then keep these glasses with you.
It's paining!

381
00:31:57,548 --> 00:32:01,382
You were like an ideal couple,
why are you alone here?

382
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:02,951
You too go away.

383
00:32:09,227 --> 00:32:11,661
I think he can sing
in high pitch too.

384
00:32:13,698 --> 00:32:18,692
I thought of impressing producer
and become a star,

385
00:32:18,903 --> 00:32:21,736
but he's sending me
to the operation theatre.

386
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,338
How come you're stabbed with knives?

387
00:32:24,542 --> 00:32:28,706
It's for good luck charm,
don't you know about knife stand?

388
00:32:28,913 --> 00:32:30,471
Knife stand?

389
00:32:30,815 --> 00:32:34,979
I've become a laughing
stock to everyone.

390
00:32:38,323 --> 00:32:41,486
Hey Man! Walk cautiously... 

391
00:32:41,659 --> 00:32:48,223
Neither front nor back... 
- Sir... - What?

392
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:51,094
What should I do if a thing
is displaced from its place?

393
00:32:51,336 --> 00:32:54,601
You fool! Keep where it was.

394
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:24,959
BHAVANI

395
00:33:36,814 --> 00:33:40,716
Keep smiling always... 

396
00:33:44,722 --> 00:33:48,681
Smile your way to success... 

397
00:34:00,438 --> 00:34:04,169
Smile is a music that
welcomes every one... 

398
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:08,402
Smile is the only costless
way to healthy life... 

399
00:34:08,613 --> 00:34:12,379
Smile is the key to beauty... 

400
00:34:51,923 --> 00:35:01,889
BHAVANI

401
00:35:11,476 --> 00:35:15,310
When branches smile... 

402
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:18,572
Won't the bamboos spring
to life with music?

403
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:23,219
When rain drops smile... 

404
00:35:23,421 --> 00:35:26,822
Won't the sky come
down as a rainbow?

405
00:35:27,091 --> 00:35:30,891
Smiles of chalk is the
foundation to education... 

406
00:35:31,095 --> 00:35:35,054
Smiles of the coal is
shining diamonds... 

407
00:35:35,266 --> 00:35:37,097
Green fields... 

408
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:38,928
Bunds of fields... 

409
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:42,573
Its smiles of the mother Earth... 

410
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:35,788
These eyes... 

411
00:36:35,993 --> 00:36:37,984
When it smiles... 

412
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:41,962
Won't it be a visual treat to watch?

413
00:36:42,166 --> 00:36:49,663
When smile unites with hands... 
Won't it become a benevolent hand?

414
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:53,537
Smile of heart is the seed of love... 

415
00:36:53,744 --> 00:36:57,703
Smile of legs will take you
to your destination... 

416
00:36:57,915 --> 00:37:01,578
If there's smile in every cell... 

417
00:37:01,786 --> 00:37:05,244
Won't luck get enslaved to us?

418
00:37:29,714 --> 00:37:39,680
BHAVANI

419
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:48,224
Hi buddy!
- Hi

420
00:37:53,304 --> 00:37:54,601
Oh She devil!

421
00:38:02,847 --> 00:38:05,645
Thank God! I escaped.

422
00:38:08,653 --> 00:38:09,915
You...?
- You...?

423
00:38:10,154 --> 00:38:11,678
How did you come?
- How did you come?

424
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:13,924
I asked you.
- I asked you.

425
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:17,925
She started is early morning.
- She started it early morning.

426
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:19,562
I will... 
- I will... 

427
00:38:19,864 --> 00:38:22,094
O God!
- O God!

428
00:38:30,408 --> 00:38:32,876
It's strange to find
you both together.

429
00:38:33,077 --> 00:38:36,945
Can't you please tell her Anjali?
I can't tolerate her.

430
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:41,642
That's what I was surprised to see
both India and Pakistan friendly.

431
00:38:41,852 --> 00:38:43,513
So the war is on.

432
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:46,850
Why are you torturing him?

433
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:49,850
The entire college is mad after you.

434
00:38:50,061 --> 00:38:52,120
And you chase him with love.

435
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:53,695
He's my choice.

436
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:55,597
O God!

437
00:38:56,767 --> 00:38:59,531
You may not know if I explain you now,

438
00:38:59,737 --> 00:39:02,672
you'll know it when you love someone.

439
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:10,610
Do you think he doesn't like me?

440
00:39:11,048 --> 00:39:13,778
He likes me. But he hides it.

441
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:17,253
Someday he'll come and
express his love to me.

442
00:39:17,755 --> 00:39:19,518
Till then, I'll not spare him.

443
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:21,457
I'll keep on torturing him.

444
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:25,522
Thank God, escaped!

445
00:39:27,064 --> 00:39:28,929
I escaped this time,
better luck next time.

446
00:39:29,133 --> 00:39:32,899
Escaped? I'll take you to task
in class room. - In class room?

447
00:39:33,104 --> 00:39:36,073
I don't know what she's up to.
- Go... go... 

448
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:54,684
Get up, you lazy!
- What's it brother-in-law?

449
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:56,325
Now, few advertisements.

450
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:59,526
This is Anand's artificial laugh.

451
00:40:11,442 --> 00:40:15,003
This is Kunal's hearty laugh.

452
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:21,441
Laugh... hearty laugh.

453
00:40:22,186 --> 00:40:23,949
Laugh... hearty laugh.

454
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:38,964
Now news... read by... 
- Hey Mimicry King, come out please.

455
00:40:40,805 --> 00:40:49,144
It's me, they call me as Mimicry Cuckoo,
Mimicry cyclone, Mimicry Tsunami.

456
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:51,273
Isn't it?

457
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:57,144
I think my fans,
I'll meet them and come.

458
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:01,749
I don't know who it is?

459
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:08,523
Knife stab is till hurting,
don't know where he'll stab now.

460
00:41:12,803 --> 00:41:14,327
Greetings sir.
What brings you here sir?

461
00:41:14,538 --> 00:41:20,773
If the daily 6 am siren blares at 8 am today,
how am I to wake up?

462
00:41:21,745 --> 00:41:22,439
Siren?

463
00:41:22,646 --> 00:41:24,204
Is it wake up hymn?

464
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:29,215
Why can't you blare the siren correctly?
You need ads for it also.

465
00:41:30,087 --> 00:41:33,454
You made my brother-in-law swoon
with your toothpaste ad.

466
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:37,058
When will he get up?
Will he get up or not?

467
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:42,861
When you do something, do it correctly.
Are you a man? My foot!

468
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:45,131
Please don't praise me so much,
I feel shy.

469
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:47,497
Enough of feeling shy, mind your work.

470
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:54,341
Your wife wants my autograph?
Tell her I'll give it by evening.

471
00:41:54,945 --> 00:41:58,779
Okay... okay... just autograph,
it's routine for me.

472
00:42:00,117 --> 00:42:02,051
Fans are growing everywhere.

473
00:42:02,253 --> 00:42:04,687
They want my autographs
and photographs.

474
00:42:05,055 --> 00:42:07,046
I think the news of my entering
record books has been leaked.

475
00:42:07,258 --> 00:42:11,820
Why are you lying to us?
We heard him.

476
00:42:12,396 --> 00:42:13,624
Do you need this?

477
00:42:14,231 --> 00:42:18,759
I can keep our colony people happy
and it'll be practice to me also.

478
00:42:18,969 --> 00:42:20,402
He didn't understand that and
went hammer and tongs at me.

479
00:42:20,604 --> 00:42:22,868
Okay, leave it,
it's routine for you.

480
00:42:23,073 --> 00:42:24,040
So you take it tomorrow.

481
00:42:24,241 --> 00:42:26,903
You never give that chance to me.

482
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:28,375
Leave it. Stop it.

483
00:42:28,579 --> 00:42:30,171
I'll visit a temple and come.

484
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:31,678
Temple? What's the occasion?

485
00:42:34,018 --> 00:42:35,349
Today is my birthday.

486
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:37,646
Birthday? Why didn't you tell us before?

487
00:42:46,263 --> 00:42:47,059
I'll go.

488
00:42:52,636 --> 00:43:00,202
Ganesh's mother used to invite everyone
for a feast and celebrated grandly

489
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:02,310
Today he's with us.

490
00:43:03,147 --> 00:43:04,580
If not as big as she did,

491
00:43:04,982 --> 00:43:06,381
we must do at least something simple.

492
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:08,878
Let's take loan for it.

493
00:43:09,353 --> 00:43:10,877
Who will loan us money here?

494
00:43:11,088 --> 00:43:13,147
If not in this area, let's go and
ask in the next area.

495
00:43:13,357 --> 00:43:15,825
When people we know
don't lend us money,

496
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:17,890
how can strangers lend us?

497
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:20,162
We don't know them
yet we are asking, aren't we?

498
00:43:22,299 --> 00:43:26,861
I don't know how we do it, but we must
celebrate his birthday grandly.

499
00:43:27,171 --> 00:43:29,537
Come. - I'll get keys.
- Okay, come.

500
00:43:33,010 --> 00:43:36,571
Come fast.
- It's a duty to wear socks everyday.

501
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:39,647
That's why I keep in pockets
instead of wearing them.

502
00:43:40,784 --> 00:43:43,184
That's not socks, it's a brief.

503
00:43:46,023 --> 00:43:47,888
These are socks.

504
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:49,858
You mean... 

505
00:43:50,828 --> 00:43:51,920
You're right.

506
00:43:52,129 --> 00:43:54,893
Saving money on soaps
and detergents.

507
00:43:55,733 --> 00:43:59,999
Show me your face once.
- Why? -Just once.

508
00:44:04,541 --> 00:44:09,205
Lord, people make many
wishes with you,

509
00:44:09,713 --> 00:44:13,581
but I'm asking you
for my Ammu only,

510
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:15,949
Ammu is my life,

511
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:19,316
but when I think she doesn't
even know my existence,

512
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:21,252
I feel very sad.

513
00:44:23,694 --> 00:44:28,222
Anyway Lord, you know when to give
and what's to be given,

514
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:31,028
all I wish is only one thing, Lord,

515
00:44:31,535 --> 00:44:33,196
my Ammu must be happy always,

516
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:34,763
that is enough for me.

517
00:44:35,272 --> 00:44:36,500
That's your responsibility.

518
00:44:54,091 --> 00:44:54,819
How are you?

519
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:58,290
Anjali, it's for you.
- Who is it?

520
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:07,159
Rajesh, I'm very happy
for your wishes.

521
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:09,236
When are you coming to India?

522
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:14,070
I want to come immediately,
but my training isn't over yet,

523
00:45:15,612 --> 00:45:17,944
I bought you a birthday gift.
- Gift?

524
00:45:18,148 --> 00:45:18,842
What is it?

525
00:45:20,117 --> 00:45:22,847
I'll not tell you, I'll give it personally
when I come to India.

526
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:25,487
Suspense? I'll wait.

527
00:45:37,901 --> 00:45:38,629
Okay!

528
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:53,747
Excuse me... your anklets.

529
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:01,148
Whose birthday is today?

530
00:46:01,358 --> 00:46:03,758
They must touch this and give it.
- One minute priest.

531
00:46:03,961 --> 00:46:05,861
Please call Anjali.

532
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:13,433
If I missed it on my birthday,
I would've been sad all the year.

533
00:46:14,304 --> 00:46:16,568
I got it back as my birthday gift.

534
00:46:18,942 --> 00:46:20,273
Is it your birthday today?

535
00:46:23,147 --> 00:46:24,239
Happy birthday!

536
00:46:33,724 --> 00:46:35,749
Who are you talking to? Come fast.

537
00:46:36,293 --> 00:46:37,157
I'm coming father.

538
00:46:39,663 --> 00:46:42,461
My father. Bye.

539
00:46:43,667 --> 00:46:44,361
Okay!

540
00:46:47,604 --> 00:46:57,570
BHAVANI

541
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:17,489
Cut the cake.

542
00:47:31,081 --> 00:47:35,780
First to my mother,
shall I offer to God? - Okay.

543
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:41,048
You remember, right?
It's birthday cake for him only.

544
00:47:41,258 --> 00:47:44,318
For us, it's breakfast,
lunch and dinner.

545
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:46,086
He shouldn't know
we haven't eaten anything,

546
00:47:46,430 --> 00:47:48,330
just act to make him believe.
Got me?

547
00:47:49,132 --> 00:47:52,033
You don't worry, let him come,
I'll shock him.

548
00:47:52,236 --> 00:47:55,433
In the name of shock if you
play the spoilsport, I'll shock you.

549
00:47:57,774 --> 00:47:59,105
What are you murmuring?

550
00:47:59,776 --> 00:48:02,210
Nothing, you said suddenly
it was your birthday,

551
00:48:02,412 --> 00:48:03,902
we went to the shop
to buy a big cake,

552
00:48:04,114 --> 00:48:06,548
they wanted to place order
in advance for big cake,

553
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:10,345
so we got this ready made small cake.
Please don't mind it.

554
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:13,853
Silly guys! Do you know
how happy I'm today?

555
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:18,555
You're the guys who celebrated
my birthday after my mother.

556
00:48:25,969 --> 00:48:27,493
Come, let's eat.

557
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:32,807
You say let's eat but
I see only one packet.

558
00:48:33,010 --> 00:48:35,137
Yes, you're the only one to eat now.

559
00:48:36,113 --> 00:48:36,841
What about you guys?

560
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:40,945
We had biryani in a
Vegetarian hotel on the way.

561
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:51,051
I mean we had vegetable biryani
and got you a chicken biryani.

562
00:48:52,129 --> 00:48:52,857
Isn't it?

563
00:48:55,165 --> 00:49:00,330
Why a chicken biryani for me
and vegetable biryani for you? Why?

564
00:49:00,837 --> 00:49:04,034
Today is no moon day,
we don't eat non-vegetarian food.

565
00:49:05,142 --> 00:49:07,576
If it's no moon day for you,
will it be full moon day for me?

566
00:49:09,112 --> 00:49:10,636
Why are you lying to me?

567
00:49:11,949 --> 00:49:13,473
He threatened to beat me
if I don't lie.

568
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:19,081
I know everything.

569
00:49:19,723 --> 00:49:22,920
You claim me as friend but
treating me like a guest.

570
00:49:24,027 --> 00:49:24,994
Nothing like that.

571
00:49:25,462 --> 00:49:26,520
What's it then?

572
00:49:26,997 --> 00:49:30,956
You may be happy to sleep hungry
feeding me,

573
00:49:31,501 --> 00:49:33,059
how can I be happy?

574
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:37,372
No, we didn't want to hurt you
with our sad tales.

575
00:49:38,742 --> 00:49:42,678
We didn't want to spoil your birthday.

576
00:49:43,013 --> 00:49:46,676
Real mad man!
You're feeling sad for my feelings,

577
00:49:47,017 --> 00:49:48,484
happiness is in it.

578
00:49:48,752 --> 00:49:52,415
Happiness doesn't come from
stomach but from heart.

579
00:49:52,756 --> 00:49:54,986
You know how happy I'm now.

580
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:58,487
This happiness can keep me
without food for a month also.

581
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:04,767
Let's eat together on my birthday.

582
00:50:08,438 --> 00:50:10,963
Come... come on pals.

583
00:50:12,342 --> 00:50:13,604
Cake... 

584
00:50:14,378 --> 00:50:15,208
Bring it also.

585
00:50:15,779 --> 00:50:17,041
You spread the mat.

586
00:50:28,058 --> 00:50:28,786
Take it.

587
00:50:41,371 --> 00:50:41,962
Eat.

588
00:50:49,112 --> 00:50:55,415
Is it no moon day for
today only or...?

589
00:50:56,453 --> 00:50:58,785
For others no moon day comes
once in a month,

590
00:50:59,456 --> 00:51:01,549
but it loves us,

591
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:04,861
so it stays with us always.

592
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:08,390
Eat.

593
00:51:42,532 --> 00:51:50,439
What's this strange bond between us?

594
00:51:50,607 --> 00:51:55,670
Neither you know nor I know... 

595
00:52:01,284 --> 00:52:02,444
Look at the situation,

596
00:52:02,752 --> 00:52:04,913
fake teeth have tooth paste,

597
00:52:05,122 --> 00:52:08,649
powder here for our original teeth.

598
00:52:08,859 --> 00:52:09,791
What?
- Look, what's this?

599
00:52:13,230 --> 00:52:13,855
You mean?

600
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:18,329
It means a singing competition
for budding singers like me.

601
00:52:18,535 --> 00:52:20,503
Is it? Aren't you trying for it?

602
00:52:20,704 --> 00:52:23,138
It's for rich not for us.

603
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:25,371
We have to pay Rs.10000 as deposit.

604
00:52:26,576 --> 00:52:27,634
Rs.10000?

605
00:52:31,314 --> 00:52:35,512
Can't you ask your music director?
Won't he be happy if you win?

606
00:52:36,386 --> 00:52:39,184
How can I ask so much money?
- Why not?

607
00:52:39,389 --> 00:52:41,016
You've been working for him.

608
00:52:41,224 --> 00:52:42,782
Did he ever pay salary to you?

609
00:52:43,093 --> 00:52:43,923
Never.

610
00:52:44,261 --> 00:52:47,526
You're asking for a good cause,
he'll give, go and ask.

611
00:52:47,898 --> 00:52:50,128
If you're hesitating to ask,
we'll ask for you.

612
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:51,925
If you want I'll also join you.

613
00:53:01,811 --> 00:53:09,081
Are you planning to commit
mass suicide or individually?

614
00:53:09,686 --> 00:53:12,018
Glad to hear it, turn this side.

615
00:53:12,422 --> 00:53:13,218
Turn.

616
00:53:14,758 --> 00:53:19,661
Don't you ever get the idea
of paying the rent.

617
00:53:20,163 --> 00:53:22,654
Why are you playing with my life?

618
00:53:23,934 --> 00:53:26,960
Actor par excellence!
Stop your histrionics.

619
00:53:27,537 --> 00:53:31,098
I need money this month,
I must pay house tax,

620
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:36,001
arrange to pay the rent,
no use to regret later.

621
00:53:37,447 --> 00:53:40,848
What's this? You've settled here
like extra baggage.

622
00:53:41,117 --> 00:53:42,948
No sir, I'll leave in few more days.

623
00:53:43,153 --> 00:53:46,247
You must go,
I'm unable to bear them.

624
00:53:47,891 --> 00:53:48,858
It stopped.

625
00:53:49,192 --> 00:53:50,591
You got me, right?

626
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:54,856
It stopped again.

627
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:56,930
I must kill the man
who invented telephone.

628
00:53:57,133 --> 00:53:59,328
Bloody missed calls.
I'll switch it off.

629
00:54:05,709 --> 00:54:07,006
Hey house owner!

630
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:19,118
Why are you scolding such good boys?

631
00:54:22,993 --> 00:54:27,293
They didn't pay rent for a year,
they'll pay next year with arrears.

632
00:54:27,497 --> 00:54:29,021
My foot! Excuse me house owner.

633
00:54:30,767 --> 00:54:31,392
Why?

634
00:54:31,601 --> 00:54:34,570
You haven't paid 3 months rent,
are you supporting them?

635
00:54:34,771 --> 00:54:37,296
Did I support them?
I talked just now, my foot!

636
00:54:37,507 --> 00:54:40,169
Who talked earlier then?
- That mimicry guy!

637
00:54:42,679 --> 00:54:46,308
Till now only my wife beat me,
now house owner too.

638
00:54:46,516 --> 00:54:48,313
Shut up! Bloody, get out!

639
00:54:49,552 --> 00:54:52,453
Is it your talent?

640
00:54:53,023 --> 00:54:56,151
I'll come in the evening,
if you don't pay my rent,

641
00:54:56,359 --> 00:54:59,385
I'll show you my mimicry talent.

642
00:54:59,963 --> 00:55:01,555
You better leave the place.
- Okay sir.

643
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:12,005
He doesn't know about you.

644
00:55:12,275 --> 00:55:17,508
Forget about me, meet your director and
try to enter the singing competition.

645
00:55:18,081 --> 00:55:21,073
Go. -You don't worry,
we'll take care of the rent.

646
00:55:21,284 --> 00:55:22,808
You go... 
- Go fast.

647
00:55:23,053 --> 00:55:25,283
Why are you still here?
You're getting late to college.

648
00:55:25,755 --> 00:55:26,517
Come.

649
00:55:27,190 --> 00:55:37,156
BHAVANI

650
00:55:37,967 --> 00:55:40,197
Don't fold the leave.
- Why?

651
00:55:40,470 --> 00:55:42,370
If you fold, it'll tear.

652
00:55:42,572 --> 00:55:45,040
If you keep it as it is,
we'll clean it and re-use it.

653
00:55:45,241 --> 00:55:49,769
What? Will you re-use the same leaf?
How can the poor man eat?

654
00:55:50,814 --> 00:55:51,781
Didn't you eat now?

655
00:55:52,315 --> 00:55:53,304
Clean the leaf.

656
00:56:03,927 --> 00:56:06,225
What's this?
- What happened?

657
00:56:06,429 --> 00:56:08,226
There's a fly in the chicken.
Look!

658
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:14,732
Are you a man? You don't see
a big chicken dead there,

659
00:56:14,938 --> 00:56:16,667
but you can see a small fly?

660
00:56:18,475 --> 00:56:19,499
Eat!

661
00:56:21,311 --> 00:56:24,508
Don't worry, we'll not
charge for the fly. Eat.

662
00:56:26,616 --> 00:56:30,177
How long will you take to cut leaves?
Do it fast, you fool.

663
00:56:30,387 --> 00:56:31,354
Finished sir.

664
00:56:33,123 --> 00:56:33,885
Greetings sir.

665
00:56:34,124 --> 00:56:36,354
What's this you've come early for lunch?

666
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:37,924
Aren't your friends coming?

667
00:56:38,128 --> 00:56:40,460
No sir, I didn't come here to dine.

668
00:56:40,663 --> 00:56:41,391
Then?

669
00:56:42,699 --> 00:56:47,693
Can I get any job in your hotel?
I'm a good cook.

670
00:56:47,904 --> 00:56:50,930
I can't offer job to a guy like you.

671
00:56:51,141 --> 00:56:53,132
If I offer you a job,

672
00:56:53,376 --> 00:56:55,139
your friends will follow you,

673
00:56:55,345 --> 00:56:58,280
they will eat to their heart's content,

674
00:56:58,481 --> 00:57:01,609
you'll adjust the bill for a pittance,

675
00:57:01,818 --> 00:57:05,811
I'll lose money and close this shop.

676
00:57:06,356 --> 00:57:08,483
I'm not such a guy.

677
00:57:08,825 --> 00:57:11,020
I too said the same to my boss,

678
00:57:11,227 --> 00:57:14,993
I'm a boss today and
he's a waiter today. Look there!

679
00:57:18,768 --> 00:57:21,464
I don't want to become
a waiter again, you may go.

680
00:57:21,671 --> 00:57:25,402
Please sir... 
- Don't disturb business. Get out!

681
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:28,669
Are you watching a film?
Mind your work.

682
00:57:29,746 --> 00:57:31,714
Is it any free kitchen?

683
00:57:38,154 --> 00:57:38,643
When is the film shoot?

684
00:57:38,855 --> 00:57:40,914
Financier has given Rs.10 lakhs cheque.

685
00:57:41,257 --> 00:57:44,886
If I get another Rs.10 lakhs,
I'll start the film shoot tomorrow.

686
00:57:45,094 --> 00:57:46,220
A man came here for hero's chance,
may I send him to you?

687
00:57:46,429 --> 00:57:48,829
Send him. I don't mind anyone.

688
00:57:49,032 --> 00:57:50,829
I can make him a hero easily.

689
00:57:51,034 --> 00:57:53,832
But don't forget Rs.10 lakhs.

690
00:58:02,212 --> 00:58:05,181
Can't you come in slowly
opening the door?

691
00:58:05,849 --> 00:58:07,612
I heard you want a hero urgently,

692
00:58:07,917 --> 00:58:09,851
I got late to get this coat on rent,

693
00:58:10,053 --> 00:58:13,147
I feared someone else may take
my chance, so I barged in,

694
00:58:13,356 --> 00:58:14,948
that's why I pushed open the door.

695
00:58:17,093 --> 00:58:18,060
What's your name?

696
00:58:18,261 --> 00:58:21,059
I was 'Mimicry' Basha till yesterday,

697
00:58:21,264 --> 00:58:24,995
from today I'm 'Punch' Basha.
- Punch Basha?

698
00:58:25,201 --> 00:58:25,929
Yes sir.

699
00:58:26,135 --> 00:58:29,161
I sought chances using my
mimicry talent, nobody cared.

700
00:58:29,372 --> 00:58:32,239
I decided to seek roles
using punch dialogues.

701
00:58:32,442 --> 00:58:34,603
That's why I've incarnated
as Punch Basha.

702
00:58:36,212 --> 00:58:39,375
Is it? Come on deliver a punch.

703
00:58:39,883 --> 00:58:42,750
I'll tell what today also
what I told yesterday,

704
00:58:43,553 --> 00:58:46,522
I'll tell the same thing every day
what I said today.

705
00:58:47,891 --> 00:58:49,017
What did you tell me the other day?

706
00:58:49,225 --> 00:58:50,123
Who knows?

707
00:58:51,394 --> 00:58:52,292
Another punch now,

708
00:58:53,463 --> 00:58:55,226
what happened had
happened for good,

709
00:58:55,431 --> 00:58:57,490
what's happening is
happening for good,

710
00:58:58,401 --> 00:59:00,699
what's going to happen
will also happen for good.

711
00:59:01,271 --> 00:59:02,295
Who said this?

712
00:59:02,672 --> 00:59:05,163
Lord Krishna said this in Holy Gita.

713
00:59:06,309 --> 00:59:07,367
Shall I deliver a super punch?

714
00:59:07,577 --> 00:59:10,011
We can't bend hands backward
or bend legs frontward.

715
00:59:11,915 --> 00:59:13,382
Did Lord say this too in Gita?

716
00:59:13,583 --> 00:59:15,278
No, my father said in drunken state.

717
00:59:17,487 --> 00:59:19,614
Dialogue is okay, what about action?

718
00:59:29,432 --> 00:59:32,560
Hey you... what are you doing?

719
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:33,586
BHAVANI

720
01:00:47,010 --> 01:00:48,807
How was my acting?
Shall we go for shooting?

721
01:00:49,679 --> 01:00:54,309
All that I had is gone?
But we can't go to shooting.

722
01:00:55,018 --> 01:00:56,144
Why?

723
01:00:56,352 --> 01:01:01,984
Seeing your acting,
I wetted my pants in fear.

724
01:01:04,861 --> 01:01:08,319
But when you poured water on your
head and jumped here and there,

725
01:01:08,698 --> 01:01:14,933
all the zeros are gone.
What's left is the digit 1.

726
01:01:17,106 --> 01:01:18,403
You mean this 1.

727
01:01:23,780 --> 01:01:26,681
You... 

728
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:33,416
Instead of finding a job,
why are you crazy about films?

729
01:01:33,723 --> 01:01:36,851
Concentrate on something.
- What can I do?

730
01:01:37,326 --> 01:01:39,191
I earn some money only
by doing such things.

731
01:01:39,662 --> 01:01:41,596
If I'm succeed in getting into films,

732
01:01:41,798 --> 01:01:44,528
I can try to get into Guinness book of
record with my money. - For that's

733
01:01:44,734 --> 01:01:45,860
Raja is here.

734
01:01:47,336 --> 01:01:49,031
Did you meet your music director?

735
01:01:49,472 --> 01:01:50,200
What did he say?

736
01:01:50,406 --> 01:01:52,874
He agreed.
- Really?

737
01:01:53,076 --> 01:01:55,636
Yes. - Thank God.
One big problem is solved.

738
01:01:56,012 --> 01:01:57,707
We were tensed.

739
01:01:57,914 --> 01:01:59,779
What are you going to sing?

740
01:02:00,349 --> 01:02:01,441
Are you well prepared?

741
01:02:02,085 --> 01:02:02,881
C'mon sing.

742
01:02:19,469 --> 01:02:29,435
BHAVANI

743
01:02:33,382 --> 01:02:36,283
Shall I sing songs
which are my life...?

744
01:02:38,721 --> 01:02:41,212
Shall I sing songs
which are my life...?

745
01:02:44,060 --> 01:02:46,290
Shall I sing songs
which are my life...?

746
01:02:46,729 --> 01:02:48,788
Shall I sing songs
which are my life...?

747
01:02:49,398 --> 01:02:54,563
Music the mystic fragrance in air... 

748
01:02:54,771 --> 01:02:59,799
On hearing a song from your heart,
the heaven will become yours... 

749
01:03:03,379 --> 01:03:13,345
BHAVANI

750
01:03:47,623 --> 01:03:52,526
The cuckoo is never sad
till it can sing... 

751
01:03:52,962 --> 01:03:58,025
Dragon fly never gets
tired buzzing its wings... 

752
01:03:58,568 --> 01:04:03,528
The river knows the
tunes of music... 

753
01:04:03,906 --> 01:04:08,969
The cool breeze knows
all the musical notes... 

754
01:04:09,345 --> 01:04:14,373
Everyone experiences the
joyousness in music... 

755
01:04:14,584 --> 01:04:19,385
Even Lord Shiva will dance
to good music... 

756
01:04:19,589 --> 01:04:25,050
Heart which loves songs
is a garden of flowers... 

757
01:05:15,478 --> 01:05:20,609
Song makes man happy... 
Song is beauty... 

758
01:05:20,883 --> 01:05:26,116
Song is an ode to love... 
Song is a relation... 

759
01:05:26,656 --> 01:05:31,616
It rains when the clouds
hear songs... 

760
01:05:31,928 --> 01:05:37,127
Meera's melodious songs
stole Lord Krishna's heart... 

761
01:05:37,333 --> 01:05:42,464
My song is my strength which
makes my anger go up in flames... 

762
01:05:42,672 --> 01:05:47,541
My music will make
this world my slave... 

763
01:05:47,743 --> 01:05:52,976
Hope is the only weapon
in the war of life... 

764
01:06:14,603 --> 01:06:24,569
BHAVANI

765
01:06:30,086 --> 01:06:30,643
Hey... 

766
01:06:34,423 --> 01:06:35,151
What happened?

767
01:06:36,325 --> 01:06:38,293
What happened?
- What happened?

768
01:06:41,630 --> 01:06:48,160
Sorry. I tried to hide it from you.
But I failed.

769
01:06:48,771 --> 01:06:50,568
We shouldn't lie to our friends.

770
01:06:57,013 --> 01:06:58,742
What? You want to sing?

771
01:06:59,615 --> 01:07:02,743
Just because you're with me
doesn't mean you can also sing.

772
01:07:03,219 --> 01:07:05,187
What do you know about music?

773
01:07:06,122 --> 01:07:09,580
My dog barks better than you.
No chance.

774
01:07:09,792 --> 01:07:11,259
When you have such a desire,

775
01:07:11,460 --> 01:07:14,258
you can no longer work for me.
Get out. Get out I say.

776
01:07:16,799 --> 01:07:19,927
I'm not sad for losing my job
or that I've no money.

777
01:07:20,202 --> 01:07:24,662
He insulted me by asking
what do I know about music.

778
01:07:25,141 --> 01:07:26,665
After coming to Hyderabad,

779
01:07:26,976 --> 01:07:30,275
I went to many companies
saying that I can sing well.

780
01:07:30,579 --> 01:07:34,777
But nobody gave me
a chance to sing.

781
01:07:35,317 --> 01:07:41,278
You heard me now. I sang well, didn't l?
Don't I look like a singer?

782
01:07:41,991 --> 01:07:43,515
Can't I ever become a singer?

783
01:07:44,660 --> 01:07:49,120
May be, as my father said,
I'm not even fit to clean tables.

784
01:07:58,174 --> 01:08:01,575
Don't care about what others
think about you.

785
01:08:01,777 --> 01:08:03,472
What you think about yourself is important.

786
01:08:05,081 --> 01:08:06,139
You can do it.

787
01:08:06,348 --> 01:08:09,476
No. We came here to
achieve something big.

788
01:08:09,852 --> 01:08:12,047
But only today I understood... 

789
01:08:12,254 --> 01:08:14,313
What did you understand?
We can do it.

790
01:08:14,957 --> 01:08:18,723
If not today, we will make it
big one day. - No.

791
01:08:19,195 --> 01:08:23,325
I've had many such chances,
but I lost them all.

792
01:08:23,632 --> 01:08:25,497
Only money decides our life.

793
01:08:28,070 --> 01:08:29,594
No matter how talented we are,

794
01:08:29,972 --> 01:08:34,841
we need a helping hand to take us on top.
We need someone's help.

795
01:08:37,446 --> 01:08:44,352
Since God can't help everyday,
God created parents.

796
01:08:45,387 --> 01:08:51,087
When they ditched us all together,
who else will help us.

797
01:08:57,566 --> 01:09:00,034
What are you blabbering?
Aren't we there with you?

798
01:09:00,803 --> 01:09:02,794
You want to participate in
the music contest, right?

799
01:09:03,405 --> 01:09:06,374
I'll give you money
by selling all my books.

800
01:09:10,246 --> 01:09:11,713
Even I hid something from you all.

801
01:09:12,748 --> 01:09:15,717
Till now, no student's name
has come on this board.

802
01:09:16,018 --> 01:09:17,645
You've spoiled our
college's reputation.

803
01:09:18,354 --> 01:09:22,381
When you can't pay the fees,
why come to study? Get lost.

804
01:09:26,262 --> 01:09:28,730
Didn't you pay the college fees?
Why didn't you tell me?

805
01:09:29,431 --> 01:09:32,400
What will you do if I had told you?

806
01:09:32,601 --> 01:09:35,229
I've would've given you
money somehow.

807
01:09:35,704 --> 01:09:37,569
You're going to college tomorrow.
- No.

808
01:09:38,107 --> 01:09:39,131
First you come up in life.

809
01:09:39,542 --> 01:09:42,170
If you become a great singer,
won't you help me to study?

810
01:09:42,411 --> 01:09:52,377
BHAVANI

811
01:09:52,555 --> 01:09:53,817
Don't be mad.

812
01:09:54,557 --> 01:09:56,582
I can become a singer
after 50 years too.

813
01:09:56,792 --> 01:09:59,920
But if you don't become
a Collector before 30 years,

814
01:10:00,296 --> 01:10:03,493
you can't become one for life.
So, you must study.

815
01:10:04,033 --> 01:10:05,591
I'll take up some job.

816
01:10:09,371 --> 01:10:14,604
Can't I work? I will work.

817
01:10:15,077 --> 01:10:18,604
I'll work hard and get you money.

818
01:10:21,083 --> 01:10:24,951
But you achieve your goals.
-Very good.

819
01:10:26,388 --> 01:10:29,118
After all these days,
you've taken the right decision.

820
01:10:29,325 --> 01:10:31,850
Before you change your minds,
take up some job.

821
01:10:32,061 --> 01:10:34,621
Prasad, take up an accountant's
job in any shop.

822
01:10:34,897 --> 01:10:36,956
You will be paid a salary
of Rs.1000 to Rs.2000.

823
01:10:39,335 --> 01:10:43,795
Raja, you're very talented.
Sing on the streets.

824
01:10:44,006 --> 01:10:46,406
You can earn a few hundreds every day.

825
01:10:51,947 --> 01:10:55,144
Do you feel people might
think you're begging?

826
01:10:55,351 --> 01:10:58,980
So what? We've to fill our stomachs.

827
01:11:01,857 --> 01:11:05,486
Do you want them to beg?
Do you know how talented they are?

828
01:11:06,195 --> 01:11:08,163
If you say a word more... 

829
01:11:15,137 --> 01:11:17,833
Why did you leave my shirt?
Hit me. Hit me I say.

830
01:11:19,141 --> 01:11:23,339
You're unfit to pay the house rent.
I need this insult for letting you my house.

831
01:11:24,813 --> 01:11:28,180
I deserve this insult.

832
01:11:28,617 --> 01:11:36,251
Since you were struggling,
I felt pity and gave this advice.

833
01:11:36,992 --> 01:11:38,459
But you're trying to hit me.

834
01:11:41,397 --> 01:11:42,523
I like your self-pride.

835
01:11:42,731 --> 01:11:49,694
But you must pay my rent dues
till date within 24 hours.

836
01:11:49,905 --> 01:11:54,535
Only then you can stay in this house.
Or else I'll chuck you guys out.

837
01:12:28,944 --> 01:12:29,842
Why are you crying?

838
01:12:34,116 --> 01:12:37,415
It's all over.

839
01:12:40,989 --> 01:12:42,320
When will I study... 

840
01:12:45,894 --> 01:12:50,991
Poor men shouldn't have any desires.

841
01:12:52,634 --> 01:12:53,430
Let's go.

842
01:12:53,802 --> 01:12:57,260
Before the owner chucks us out,
let's leave on our own.

843
01:13:00,909 --> 01:13:01,773
Where is Ganesh?

844
01:13:06,982 --> 01:13:11,442
He wouldn't want to trouble us.
So, he must have left.

845
01:13:28,170 --> 01:13:32,231
No. I've had many such chances,
but I lost them all.

846
01:13:32,441 --> 01:13:35,968
Only money decides our life.

847
01:13:36,178 --> 01:13:37,907
No matter how talented we are,

848
01:13:38,113 --> 01:13:43,642
we need a helping hand to take us on top.
We need someone's help.

849
01:13:46,288 --> 01:13:52,488
But you must pay my rent dues
till date within 24 hours.

850
01:13:52,694 --> 01:13:57,495
Only then you can stay in this house.
Or else I'll chuck you guys out.

851
01:14:12,047 --> 01:14:16,848
Ganesh, take this.
This isn't any ordinary chain.

852
01:14:17,553 --> 01:14:21,421
It's the auspicious thread which
you must tie to Ammu.

853
01:14:22,558 --> 01:14:29,862
Whatever hardship you may face,
never lose this. Okay? - Okay

854
01:14:35,737 --> 01:14:40,140
Why are you inviting trouble that
you should drop like hot potato?

855
01:14:40,809 --> 01:14:44,370
We must nip it in bud.

856
01:14:56,758 --> 01:15:02,060
Forgive me mother.
I couldn't fulfill your wish.

857
01:15:05,033 --> 01:15:07,729
Instead of being a symbol
of my unfulfilled love,

858
01:15:09,438 --> 01:15:11,565
let this help my friends
to achieve their goals.

859
01:15:14,443 --> 01:15:15,239
Yes mother.

860
01:15:16,445 --> 01:15:22,907
My friends are more important to me
than my unseen sweetheart.

861
01:15:24,786 --> 01:15:26,344
My friends are important to me.

862
01:15:33,629 --> 01:15:35,597
Take this. Okay.

863
01:15:48,577 --> 01:15:58,543
BHAVANI

864
01:16:22,844 --> 01:16:23,469
What is this?

865
01:16:24,179 --> 01:16:25,146
Where are you going?

866
01:16:25,781 --> 01:16:26,805
Where did you go?

867
01:16:28,116 --> 01:16:29,743
House owner shouted at you last night.

868
01:16:30,218 --> 01:16:33,153
I couldn't sleep properly.
I didn't know what to do.

869
01:16:33,455 --> 01:16:34,979
I suddenly remembered
my uncle's address.

870
01:16:35,257 --> 01:16:37,487
So, I went to him without
informing you.

871
01:16:38,026 --> 01:16:39,653
He's leaving to Singapore today.

872
01:16:40,028 --> 01:16:42,326
I met him before he could
leave to Singapore.

873
01:16:42,531 --> 01:16:44,158
What? Did you meet your uncle?

874
01:16:44,366 --> 01:16:46,994
Yes. He was very happy to see me.

875
01:16:47,369 --> 01:16:48,666
Once I told him about us
and our problems,

876
01:16:48,870 --> 01:16:52,169
he gave me money to throw
at the owner's face.

877
01:16:52,374 --> 01:16:56,674
Are you telling the truth?
- It's true. Here is the money.

878
01:16:58,146 --> 01:17:00,171
So, can I pay my college fees?

879
01:17:00,716 --> 01:17:04,174
Not only your college fees,
Raja can also participate in the music contest.

880
01:17:05,721 --> 01:17:07,188
Prasad, take the money.

881
01:17:10,158 --> 01:17:12,524
Take money and pay your college fees.

882
01:17:13,729 --> 01:17:16,527
Raja, you go and pay for the music contest

883
01:17:20,068 --> 01:17:26,200
No more worries hereafter.
My uncle is there to help us.

884
01:17:27,075 --> 01:17:27,700
Go.

885
01:17:28,510 --> 01:17:29,704
Go with him.

886
01:17:30,078 --> 01:17:33,275
I'll pay the rent dues to the owner.
- Okay.

887
01:17:36,918 --> 01:17:39,045
Your house rent dues.

888
01:17:39,655 --> 01:17:41,885
A guest paying the rent dues...?

889
01:17:43,091 --> 01:17:44,388
I'm no more their guest.

890
01:17:44,926 --> 01:17:46,553
I'm going to stay here along with them.

891
01:17:47,929 --> 01:17:52,389
They have spoilt you too.
I don't know how you got this money.

892
01:17:52,768 --> 01:17:55,566
But now you've money.
Take the money and go home.

893
01:17:55,771 --> 01:17:57,068
If possible, take them also with you.

894
01:17:57,773 --> 01:18:00,901
Please don't say that.
They will come up in life very soon.

895
01:18:01,209 --> 01:18:04,337
Till then, I want to be with them.
-Achieve what?

896
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:07,405
What can they achieve which
they couldn't all these days?

897
01:18:07,883 --> 01:18:12,081
Those idiots aren't that talented.
-You're wrong.

898
01:18:12,621 --> 01:18:14,851
Though a match stick can
burn down an entire forest,

899
01:18:15,290 --> 01:18:17,087
you need a hand to burn it.

900
01:18:17,626 --> 01:18:18,854
God can be in stones.

901
01:18:19,227 --> 01:18:21,923
But you need a sculptor
to chisel it out.

902
01:18:22,631 --> 01:18:26,931
Similarly, one may be very talented,
but needs one chance to stage it.

903
01:18:27,569 --> 01:18:31,938
Until they get such chance,
there is no one to support them.

904
01:18:32,307 --> 01:18:34,605
They at least need someone
to raise their confidence.

905
01:18:35,644 --> 01:18:37,771
What do you know about them?

906
01:18:37,979 --> 01:18:40,709
You only know about these
3 living in this place.

907
01:18:40,916 --> 01:18:45,444
But I know how many live in
such places in Hyderabad.

908
01:18:47,989 --> 01:18:50,787
Many come here to achieve big things.

909
01:18:51,093 --> 01:18:54,460
They don't listen to their parents' advice.
Unable to succeed,

910
01:18:54,663 --> 01:18:57,131
they even struggle for a square meal.

911
01:18:57,499 --> 01:18:59,399
When they find an innocent like you,

912
01:18:59,601 --> 01:19:03,799
they praise you and
swindle his money too.

913
01:19:04,005 --> 01:19:08,567
They drink, enjoy and finally he'll
become one of them.

914
01:19:08,777 --> 01:19:09,641
Do you need that?

915
01:19:09,845 --> 01:19:10,709
Not only you,

916
01:19:10,912 --> 01:19:15,975
many like you think that young
boys drink and ogle at girls.

917
01:19:16,518 --> 01:19:18,315
But young boys of this
generation aren't like that.

918
01:19:19,521 --> 01:19:21,989
They can make history.

919
01:19:23,525 --> 01:19:27,484
Everyone of you are ready
to give advises to others.

920
01:19:27,963 --> 01:19:34,061
But have you ever thought what their dreams
are and what are they struggling so hard for?

921
01:19:35,203 --> 01:19:36,500
Life is like an ocean.

922
01:19:37,038 --> 01:19:41,498
We stay on the shore and watch.
But they swim against the tide.

923
01:19:42,210 --> 01:19:45,338
You people think they will drown.

924
01:19:46,047 --> 01:19:49,175
But we young boys believe that
they will come back with pearls.

925
01:19:50,218 --> 01:19:54,177
Instead of giving advises to
a person climbing the ladder,

926
01:19:54,656 --> 01:19:56,521
if we could hold the ladder firmly,

927
01:19:56,892 --> 01:19:58,951
it'll give him the confidence
to climb fast.

928
01:19:59,561 --> 01:20:01,028
What I am going to do is
one such small help.

929
01:20:01,229 --> 01:20:04,528
Please go ahead.
Anyway they are spoilt.

930
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,525
I wanted you to come up in life.
So my advice.

931
01:20:07,736 --> 01:20:10,364
But you if you want to become
one like them,

932
01:20:10,739 --> 01:20:12,366
I can't stop you, can l?
It's your wish.

933
01:20:12,574 --> 01:20:15,543
All I want is my rent.
I don't care who gives it.

934
01:20:16,578 --> 01:20:18,546
Will you at least pay the
rent properly hereafter?

935
01:20:19,014 --> 01:20:20,208
Do you know why I am
asking you this question?

936
01:20:20,415 --> 01:20:24,784
Till now there were only 3.
Now, you've joined them. God help you.

937
01:20:25,353 --> 01:20:28,982
We will not get ruined.
We will make it big. - Let me see.

938
01:20:29,758 --> 01:20:31,726
You will see. Thanks.

939
01:21:07,162 --> 01:21:08,060
What?

940
01:21:08,330 --> 01:21:12,061
Is Poori your breakfast at home?
- No. It's Idly.

941
01:21:12,334 --> 01:21:15,565
Our breakfast is poori.
-You fool!

942
01:21:15,770 --> 01:21:18,068
Know where I am going
before asking me something.

943
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:21,739
To hell with your poori.

944
01:21:25,347 --> 01:21:31,081
Without body spray, I really stink.
It smells so good.

945
01:21:32,120 --> 01:21:33,985
Forget about the spray,
did you wear that?

946
01:21:35,123 --> 01:21:36,351
Want to see my socks?

947
01:21:36,625 --> 01:21:41,426
Not that. Did you wear the guard?
- Want to see?

948
01:21:41,630 --> 01:21:45,430
No. I believe you.
Don't remove your pant.

949
01:21:45,634 --> 01:21:49,434
I won't do that.
I was trying to show my pockets.

950
01:21:50,472 --> 01:21:52,099
Thank God.
- Take this.

951
01:21:55,477 --> 01:21:55,943
Take it.

952
01:21:57,245 --> 01:21:58,769
What's it?
- Pocket money.

953
01:22:02,484 --> 01:22:03,348
Why that box?

954
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:07,286
Though we had money then,

955
01:22:07,722 --> 01:22:10,122
you couldn't participate
in that contest on time.

956
01:22:10,392 --> 01:22:13,293
We shouldn't face such situation again.
So, this box.

957
01:22:14,496 --> 01:22:17,294
I'm getting late.
I must go to my uncle's house.

958
01:22:17,499 --> 01:22:19,626
I'm leaving.

959
01:22:24,673 --> 01:22:25,640
Take the keys.

960
01:22:43,124 --> 01:22:46,582
A heart as pure as the breeze... 

961
01:22:46,795 --> 01:22:50,253
Gold shines only when it gets burnt... 

962
01:22:57,973 --> 01:23:01,272
A heart with a fist full of desires... 

963
01:23:01,476 --> 01:23:05,606
Eyes are relishing with new dream... 

964
01:23:12,687 --> 01:23:19,752
Your smile is your friend... 
Reach heaven with your friendship... 

965
01:23:19,995 --> 01:23:34,467
Surge ahead... no more worries... 
the world is all yours... 

966
01:23:35,243 --> 01:23:45,209
BHAVANI

967
01:24:29,164 --> 01:24:30,028
Why so late?

968
01:24:30,231 --> 01:24:31,289
Don't ask me.

969
01:24:31,499 --> 01:24:34,798
Since my uncle is not in station,
I have to look after everything.

970
01:24:35,003 --> 01:24:38,131
My aunt insisted me to eat.
So, I got late.

971
01:24:38,339 --> 01:24:40,136
Why don't you introduce us
to your uncle?

972
01:24:40,442 --> 01:24:43,138
He has helped us a lot.
We must thank him.

973
01:24:45,346 --> 01:24:48,645
Once he returns from Singapore,
I'll introduce him to you.

974
01:24:51,686 --> 01:24:55,315
Does your uncle have a daughter?

975
01:24:56,091 --> 01:24:59,219
Since they are looking after you so well,

976
01:24:59,427 --> 01:25:01,987
they might have an intention of
making you their son-in-law.

977
01:25:02,197 --> 01:25:06,395
Sure, they must have such intention.
If not, why would they help us?

978
01:25:06,634 --> 01:25:07,328
Am I right?

979
01:25:09,204 --> 01:25:11,001
Nothing like that.

980
01:25:13,541 --> 01:25:15,839
I've to go there early morning.
I will sleep.

981
01:25:16,878 --> 01:25:18,846
Even I have an important work
tomorrow morning.

982
01:25:19,047 --> 01:25:20,173
Wake me up by 10 am.

983
01:25:21,883 --> 01:25:24,181
Does your uncle have a daughter?

984
01:25:24,719 --> 01:25:27,620
Since they are looking after you so well,

985
01:25:27,822 --> 01:25:30,518
they might have an intention of
making you their son-in-law.

986
01:25:31,392 --> 01:25:34,850
I saw... I saw... 

987
01:25:36,064 --> 01:25:40,023
I saw you in the moonlight... 

988
01:25:40,468 --> 01:25:44,461
I saw... I saw... and
became your devotee... 

989
01:25:45,073 --> 01:25:49,203
I saw... I saw... I saw happiness in
the mischievous age... 

990
01:25:49,477 --> 01:25:53,880
I saw... I saw... 
I hid it in my heart... 

991
01:25:54,349 --> 01:26:02,882
Amidst billions of stars,
you're my moon... 

992
01:26:03,424 --> 01:26:12,059
Among millions of women,
Ammu, you're my only love... 

993
01:26:16,104 --> 01:26:17,571
What are you doing here at this hour?

994
01:26:18,206 --> 01:26:20,674
Nothing. I couldn't sleep.
So I sat here.

995
01:26:20,875 --> 01:26:22,638
Why are you sitting out in cold?

996
01:26:23,111 --> 01:26:24,237
Come. Let's go home.

997
01:26:24,445 --> 01:26:27,346
Yes. Once the winter is gone,
come here and sleep every day.

998
01:26:27,549 --> 01:26:29,414
Let's go.
- Come.

999
01:26:33,621 --> 01:26:34,349
Take it.

1000
01:26:35,356 --> 01:26:45,322
BHAVANI

1001
01:26:47,135 --> 01:26:51,094
You... how dare you spill
that on my sweetheart?

1002
01:26:53,141 --> 01:26:54,438
How dare you!

1003
01:26:55,310 --> 01:26:57,107
I will beat you to pulp.
- Listen to me.

1004
01:26:57,645 --> 01:26:58,771
I beg you... 

1005
01:27:03,484 --> 01:27:05,452
How dare you hit him?
I will kill you.

1006
01:27:12,160 --> 01:27:18,121
What nonsense are you talking?
- Listen to me. Leave it.

1007
01:27:19,100 --> 01:27:20,965
Someone is beating our friend.
Come.

1008
01:27:23,671 --> 01:27:25,798
Stop.
- How dare you hit my friend?

1009
01:27:26,007 --> 01:27:27,133
Listen to me. No.

1010
01:27:33,448 --> 01:27:39,648
Police... Police.
- Come, let's go.

1011
01:27:47,528 --> 01:27:50,554
Who are they?
What's happening here?

1012
01:27:51,866 --> 01:27:53,561
He is a very good boy.

1013
01:27:53,768 --> 01:27:55,827
He was doing business here
for quite some days.

1014
01:27:56,037 --> 01:27:58,005
They fought with him unnecessarily.

1015
01:27:58,206 --> 01:28:00,674
He earns a few hundreds every day.

1016
01:28:00,942 --> 01:28:02,842
Poor guy! He had nothing today.

1017
01:28:06,948 --> 01:28:08,176
So many lies.

1018
01:28:08,583 --> 01:28:12,576
You said your uncle will give money
and told us not to worry about anything.

1019
01:28:13,054 --> 01:28:14,851
But actually you were cleaning plates.

1020
01:28:16,724 --> 01:28:19,522
Even our parents were more
concerned about their luxury.

1021
01:28:20,228 --> 01:28:21,923
They never cared for us.

1022
01:28:24,232 --> 01:28:28,191
If you want to get burnt and give us light,
we don't need such light.

1023
01:28:28,636 --> 01:28:33,596
We'll better live in the dark.
- Is it over?

1024
01:28:35,576 --> 01:28:37,043
What big sacrifice have I done?

1025
01:28:37,578 --> 01:28:43,141
Only a mother will stay hungry
to feed her child.

1026
01:28:44,185 --> 01:28:47,052
You were like a mother and
offered me food.

1027
01:28:47,989 --> 01:28:49,718
I haven't done anything
bigger than that.

1028
01:28:51,092 --> 01:28:54,721
Why did you suffer to celebrate my birthday?

1029
01:28:54,929 --> 01:28:56,954
What question is that?
You are my friend.

1030
01:28:57,598 --> 01:28:59,566
Then, aren't you my friends?

1031
01:29:02,370 --> 01:29:04,497
That doesn't mean you need
to do such cheap job.

1032
01:29:04,806 --> 01:29:08,742
No job is cheap.
Being idle is cheap.

1033
01:29:09,944 --> 01:29:15,075
You want me to be happy.
Shouldn't I think the same way?

1034
01:29:17,885 --> 01:29:21,082
For my friends I can do cleaning
and washing too happily

1035
01:29:22,957 --> 01:29:27,087
If you are my true friends,
think about you not me.

1036
01:29:28,363 --> 01:29:31,992
If you really want to make it big,
don't look at the path you tread.

1037
01:29:32,300 --> 01:29:33,858
Instead see your destiny.

1038
01:29:35,636 --> 01:29:37,536
Please don't make me feel
like a stranger.

1039
01:29:38,406 --> 01:29:40,271
I don't even want to remain
like this either.

1040
01:29:42,243 --> 01:29:46,612
I've save some money.
I've planned to set up a hotel.

1041
01:29:47,482 --> 01:29:50,542
Till then, bear with me.

1042
01:29:58,326 --> 01:30:01,227
And your uncle is also a lie, right?

1043
01:30:04,932 --> 01:30:06,456
You acted very well.

1044
01:30:15,743 --> 01:30:19,543
If you are my true friends,
think about you not me.

1045
01:30:24,519 --> 01:30:26,384
If you really want to make it big,

1046
01:30:26,921 --> 01:30:28,286
don't look at the path you tread.

1047
01:30:28,523 --> 01:30:30,047
Instead see your destiny.

1048
01:30:40,601 --> 01:30:41,659
What did he say?

1049
01:30:45,506 --> 01:30:55,472
BHAVANI

1050
01:30:59,287 --> 01:31:00,185
Don't your pranks have limits?

1051
01:31:00,388 --> 01:31:01,582
What if he complains to the principal?

1052
01:31:01,789 --> 01:31:02,585
What will happen to my studies?

1053
01:31:02,790 --> 01:31:06,248
So, accept that you love me.

1054
01:31:06,561 --> 01:31:08,859
I'm not in good mood.
Don't play with me.

1055
01:31:09,096 --> 01:31:11,758
I will get angry.
- Trying to threaten me?

1056
01:31:12,033 --> 01:31:17,437
If you do so, I will hug you tightly.
And I will shout loud.

1057
01:31:17,638 --> 01:31:19,196
Keep quiet.
-You keep quiet.

1058
01:31:19,640 --> 01:31:20,436
Want to see?

1059
01:31:20,808 --> 01:31:22,776
Want to see?

1060
01:31:26,647 --> 01:31:28,205
I told you I'm not interested in you.

1061
01:31:28,416 --> 01:31:30,680
Why come after me like a prostitute?

1062
01:31:34,755 --> 01:31:35,346
Get lost.

1063
01:31:48,603 --> 01:31:51,970
Prasad, since Priya took advantage of you,

1064
01:31:52,507 --> 01:31:54,134
you misunderstood her.

1065
01:31:54,675 --> 01:31:57,303
Poor girl! After her mother's death,

1066
01:31:57,845 --> 01:31:59,710
her father pampered a lot.

1067
01:32:00,515 --> 01:32:02,312
That's why she is behaving like that.

1068
01:32:04,418 --> 01:32:05,578
Whether you know it or not,

1069
01:32:05,953 --> 01:32:10,253
she is so wealthy that men are waiting
in queue to marry her.

1070
01:32:10,691 --> 01:32:11,988
But she likes you only.

1071
01:32:12,860 --> 01:32:14,657
But you... 

1072
01:32:16,197 --> 01:32:18,256
Don't you like Priya?

1073
01:32:20,368 --> 01:32:22,836
Tell me. We need a solution, don't we?

1074
01:32:23,371 --> 01:32:24,599
Who pays for your studies?

1075
01:32:25,540 --> 01:32:28,338
Who pays for your studies?
- My father.

1076
01:32:29,477 --> 01:32:31,342
And for Priya?
- Her father.

1077
01:32:32,046 --> 01:32:34,173
And your friend Kavitha?
- Her uncle.

1078
01:32:35,216 --> 01:32:38,014
Not only here but everywhere,

1079
01:32:38,319 --> 01:32:44,087
a mother or a father or a brother or
an uncle pays for a ward's studies,

1080
01:32:44,725 --> 01:32:47,956
But do you know who pays
for my studies?

1081
01:32:49,664 --> 01:32:50,528
My friend.

1082
01:32:51,399 --> 01:32:54,197
He washes plates to
make me a Collector.

1083
01:32:55,570 --> 01:32:58,300
Even God gives boons
only after being sought.

1084
01:32:58,573 --> 01:33:01,041
But he gives us everything
we need without asking.

1085
01:33:01,676 --> 01:33:02,973
How can I betray him?

1086
01:33:06,414 --> 01:33:08,644
I like Priya. I don't deny that.

1087
01:33:09,150 --> 01:33:11,880
But my objective is more
important than my love.

1088
01:33:12,086 --> 01:33:14,884
Above all that, I want to be true
to my friend Ganesh.

1089
01:33:15,423 --> 01:33:17,721
How can I make her understand all this?

1090
01:33:19,026 --> 01:33:20,323
Prasad, what are you saying?

1091
01:33:21,262 --> 01:33:25,460
I've heard about friends who go
to a movie or even exchange clothes.

1092
01:33:26,867 --> 01:33:30,303
But if he's struggling hard
for your studies... 

1093
01:33:31,772 --> 01:33:33,069
I want to see him once.

1094
01:33:37,111 --> 01:33:38,738
What about your parents?

1095
01:33:41,882 --> 01:33:45,249
I've no one. Even my relatives
have left me to my fate.

1096
01:34:05,406 --> 01:34:06,100
What's it?

1097
01:34:08,342 --> 01:34:12,278
I will ask you something.
Please don't mistake me.

1098
01:34:13,347 --> 01:34:16,612
There is a girl Priya in my college.
She loves me.

1099
01:34:17,985 --> 01:34:20,954
I told herthat I'm not in
such a situation.

1100
01:34:21,489 --> 01:34:23,286
But she doesn't understand.

1101
01:34:24,325 --> 01:34:29,126
I slapped her yesterday.
I even abused her.

1102
01:34:30,998 --> 01:34:35,298
I shouldn't have been so rude.
Poor girl! She felt very bad.

1103
01:34:36,337 --> 01:34:38,965
I'm scared that she might harm herself.

1104
01:34:41,075 --> 01:34:43,475
Shall I tell her that I too love her?

1105
01:34:45,780 --> 01:34:46,974
Shall I also love her?

1106
01:34:51,352 --> 01:34:53,547
Heard what he said?

1107
01:34:56,524 --> 01:34:58,549
He wants my permission
to fall in love.

1108
01:35:05,633 --> 01:35:06,861
What question is that!

1109
01:35:13,207 --> 01:35:16,472
Everyone on earth do fall in love.

1110
01:35:16,711 --> 01:35:20,909
But you're the first man to
seek permission to fall in love.

1111
01:35:23,250 --> 01:35:29,120
Love can't be erased like
the letters on the slate.

1112
01:35:29,990 --> 01:35:33,391
Love is responsible for
humans to be humane.

1113
01:35:35,996 --> 01:35:37,623
How will I be against love?

1114
01:35:39,700 --> 01:35:43,830
In fact, you fear that you'll get
distracted if you fall in love.

1115
01:35:44,271 --> 01:35:45,203
It's not like that.

1116
01:35:45,673 --> 01:35:48,403
To succeed in life, fall in love.

1117
01:35:50,778 --> 01:35:54,475
Because all those who have
made it big did fall in love.

1118
01:35:54,682 --> 01:35:58,948
A friend must have united
all lovers on earth.

1119
01:36:00,054 --> 01:36:01,248
I'm your friend.

1120
01:36:06,193 --> 01:36:09,492
With so much love for her,
you hurt her heart very badly.

1121
01:36:10,231 --> 01:36:12,290
If you feel hurt for hurting her,

1122
01:36:12,933 --> 01:36:14,696
how bad she must have felt.

1123
01:36:16,937 --> 01:36:19,770
Go and express your love to her.

1124
01:36:24,211 --> 01:36:24,802
Go.

1125
01:36:31,385 --> 01:36:34,548
He needn't have to say anything.

1126
01:36:35,156 --> 01:36:37,317
Now I know he loves me.

1127
01:36:37,892 --> 01:36:38,916
That's enough.

1128
01:36:39,393 --> 01:36:42,692
All that I want his love and nothing else.

1129
01:36:43,164 --> 01:36:45,632
Sorry Priya. I didn't... 
- Don't talk to me.

1130
01:36:45,833 --> 01:36:47,926
Try to understand.
- Don't come to me.

1131
01:36:48,135 --> 01:36:52,231
Ganesh tell him that I came to see you
and not him. I don't need you.

1132
01:36:52,439 --> 01:36:53,064
Get lost.

1133
01:36:53,440 --> 01:36:56,204
How dare you say that in front of them.
You... 

1134
01:37:25,072 --> 01:37:26,471
Have water.

1135
01:37:33,614 --> 01:37:35,206
Someone must be thinking about you.

1136
01:37:37,451 --> 01:37:39,942
I've met you before... 

1137
01:37:40,287 --> 01:37:42,278
We met in the temple.
Do you remember?

1138
01:37:42,690 --> 01:37:44,214
Right. I remember.

1139
01:37:45,292 --> 01:37:47,283
She is Anjali, my college mate.

1140
01:37:48,295 --> 01:37:49,523
My name is Ganesh.

1141
01:37:49,964 --> 01:37:51,158
Excuse me.

1142
01:37:53,534 --> 01:38:03,500
BHAVANI

1143
01:38:06,981 --> 01:38:09,381
Ganesh, someone must be
thinking about you.

1144
01:38:13,487 --> 01:38:14,419
Have water.

1145
01:38:20,694 --> 01:38:21,524
Thanks.

1146
01:38:22,196 --> 01:38:23,220
When are you inaugurating the hotel?

1147
01:38:23,664 --> 01:38:25,564
Next Friday.
- Hotel's name?

1148
01:38:26,100 --> 01:38:27,431
Friends Mess.

1149
01:38:33,507 --> 01:38:36,908
He had hiccups when I thought of him.

1150
01:38:37,544 --> 01:38:39,273
But when I got hiccups...?

1151
01:38:44,084 --> 01:38:46,814
You won't understand if I tell you now.

1152
01:38:47,021 --> 01:38:49,888
You'll know when you fall in love.

1153
01:38:51,525 --> 01:38:54,688
Prasad, invite them for inauguration
of the hotel. Hello... 

1154
01:40:14,708 --> 01:40:15,834
Please take sweets.

1155
01:40:16,043 --> 01:40:17,135
Prasad has passed his exams.

1156
01:40:17,778 --> 01:40:19,769
He's going to Delhi for lAS training.

1157
01:40:20,547 --> 01:40:23,914
Ganesh, when you challenged
me the other day,

1158
01:40:24,184 --> 01:40:26,516
I thought you said that in
the rush of blood.

1159
01:40:26,720 --> 01:40:33,216
But you've proved that with self-confidence,
one can achieve anything.

1160
01:40:43,070 --> 01:40:44,037
This is for Raja.

1161
01:40:44,772 --> 01:40:46,034
This is for Prasad.

1162
01:40:47,207 --> 01:40:47,901
This is for you.

1163
01:40:49,009 --> 01:40:50,033
This is for Ganesh.

1164
01:41:13,033 --> 01:41:14,261
What are you looking at?

1165
01:41:21,075 --> 01:41:23,703
You look handsome in that T-shirt.

1166
01:41:24,278 --> 01:41:27,645
Look, he is feeling shy.

1167
01:41:36,957 --> 01:41:37,981
Please... 

1168
01:41:38,725 --> 01:41:48,691
BHAVANI

1169
01:41:51,672 --> 01:41:54,140
Friendship is the sweetest flower... 

1170
01:41:54,341 --> 01:41:56,605
Friendship is our breath... 

1171
01:41:56,810 --> 01:42:00,143
Friendship is happiness... 

1172
01:42:10,924 --> 01:42:15,725
Festivals come once in a blue moon... 

1173
01:42:15,929 --> 01:42:20,662
But in friendship,
it is fun time always... 

1174
01:42:20,868 --> 01:42:25,737
Like the colours of holi,
our hearts met... 

1175
01:42:25,939 --> 01:42:31,104
and we turned into
a colourful rainbow... 

1176
01:42:40,754 --> 01:42:50,720
BHAVANI

1177
01:43:11,852 --> 01:43:14,047
In the river called friendship... 

1178
01:43:14,488 --> 01:43:16,718
we immersed ourselves deep into it... 

1179
01:43:16,990 --> 01:43:21,051
We saw the love of parents in it... 

1180
01:43:21,828 --> 01:43:26,527
Relations come for our wealth... 

1181
01:43:26,900 --> 01:43:31,337
But our friendship gave us love... 

1182
01:43:31,538 --> 01:43:36,475
When in deep trouble,
it wipes our tears... 

1183
01:43:36,677 --> 01:43:41,637
A friend in need is a friend indeed... 

1184
01:43:41,848 --> 01:43:44,316
Lord Krishna has a temple... 

1185
01:43:44,518 --> 01:43:46,782
But Karna has none... 

1186
01:43:46,987 --> 01:43:51,447
What's wrong if we build
a temple for friendship?

1187
01:43:51,692 --> 01:44:00,657
It's an eyesore to everyone,
but love is an eyesore to parents... 

1188
01:44:01,568 --> 01:44:10,909
Friendship is the Taj Mahal
shining bright in moonlight... 

1189
01:44:20,621 --> 01:44:30,587
BHAVANI

1190
01:44:45,112 --> 01:44:46,238
Travel carefully.

1191
01:44:52,953 --> 01:44:56,480
Call me if you need money.
- Okay.

1192
01:45:01,094 --> 01:45:11,060
BHAVANI

1193
01:45:19,746 --> 01:45:23,147
I heard toilets are very clean here,
may I check it once?

1194
01:45:23,750 --> 01:45:24,808
What are you saying?

1195
01:45:26,053 --> 01:45:26,849
Carry on.

1196
01:45:27,421 --> 01:45:28,479
Me too!

1197
01:45:30,057 --> 01:45:32,582
My flight is at 6 am tomorrow,
I'll get my ticket.

1198
01:45:36,930 --> 01:45:39,421
Prasad has left to Delhi
to get lAS training,

1199
01:45:40,067 --> 01:45:42,228
if these guys too make it big in life.

1200
01:45:43,070 --> 01:45:45,470
You always think about
your friends lives,

1201
01:45:45,739 --> 01:45:49,140
don't you've any personal ambition?
- Why not? I too have.

1202
01:45:49,343 --> 01:45:50,901
You never told me till now.

1203
01:45:51,611 --> 01:45:54,603
Will I keep you dark about it?
You'll hear it first from me.

1204
01:45:57,317 --> 01:46:00,844
But not now, I'll tell after
I achieve my ambition.

1205
01:46:03,523 --> 01:46:07,550
May be Ganesh is hesitating
to express his love like me.

1206
01:46:07,761 --> 01:46:10,787
Why would he then promise
to tell his aim to me first?

1207
01:46:10,997 --> 01:46:15,024
Let him achieve his ambition,
I'll wait till then.

1208
01:46:28,081 --> 01:46:38,047
BHAVANI

1209
01:46:48,101 --> 01:46:51,764
Dumb heart is talking... 

1210
01:46:51,972 --> 01:46:55,874
It says love is very fine... 

1211
01:46:59,780 --> 01:47:03,409
My mischievous youth desires you... 

1212
01:47:03,617 --> 01:47:10,614
Because you're my love... 
I want to be with you... 

1213
01:47:10,824 --> 01:47:14,521
I want your companionship... 

1214
01:47:14,728 --> 01:47:18,630
To become part of your love and life... 

1215
01:47:18,832 --> 01:47:22,495
I'm dreaming about you... 

1216
01:47:22,702 --> 01:47:26,365
Would I say no to you?

1217
01:47:31,912 --> 01:47:41,878
BHAVANI

1218
01:48:05,545 --> 01:48:09,174
May I build castles with clouds... 

1219
01:48:09,449 --> 01:48:13,044
May I present it to you... 

1220
01:48:13,253 --> 01:48:16,984
I don't want you to take so much risk... 

1221
01:48:17,190 --> 01:48:20,387
A little place in your heart is enough... 

1222
01:48:20,594 --> 01:48:28,160
O my love, may I bring down the
stars from sky for you... 

1223
01:48:28,368 --> 01:48:36,332
O my love, your warm smile of happiness
is worth more than stars... 

1224
01:48:36,543 --> 01:48:40,536
To see your image in my eyes... 

1225
01:48:45,585 --> 01:48:55,551
BHAVANI

1226
01:49:22,589 --> 01:49:25,922
May I pluck flowers
from the branches... 

1227
01:49:26,092 --> 01:49:29,926
May I squeeze out honey from it
and serve it to you... 

1228
01:49:30,096 --> 01:49:37,434
Your sweet kisses are more
sweeter than honey... 

1229
01:49:37,604 --> 01:49:45,101
Tell me what else you want... 

1230
01:49:45,312 --> 01:49:53,219
O my love, arrest me for the life
in your warm hug... 

1231
01:49:53,553 --> 01:49:57,580
To be your companion
for all the life... 

1232
01:50:50,076 --> 01:50:53,136
Brother-in-law, we get clothes
very cheap in Hyderabad.

1233
01:50:53,613 --> 01:50:56,104
We can save at least Rs.50 a sari.

1234
01:50:56,516 --> 01:50:58,279
We everything here other
than good food,

1235
01:50:58,485 --> 01:51:00,043
look at this dirty table.

1236
01:51:00,253 --> 01:51:02,915
Where is the cleaner?
- Coming sir.

1237
01:51:03,590 --> 01:51:05,319
Come quickly, flies are hovering.

1238
01:51:05,792 --> 01:51:08,056
What great Hyderabad! My foot!

1239
01:51:08,261 --> 01:51:09,819
Great name but worst place.

1240
01:51:10,030 --> 01:51:13,557
Our Ramapuram is far better.
- Father!

1241
01:51:15,769 --> 01:51:25,735
BHAVANI

1242
01:51:31,451 --> 01:51:32,418
Excellent!

1243
01:51:32,619 --> 01:51:34,985
You know him, don't you?

1244
01:51:35,188 --> 01:51:39,181
The same man who came here to
become legendary Ghantasala.

1245
01:51:40,393 --> 01:51:44,193
I warned that you'll clean
leftovers for a living,

1246
01:51:44,664 --> 01:51:46,655
look, you're doing it now.

1247
01:51:47,634 --> 01:51:51,730
I feared you may become a great
singer and defeat me, but no... 

1248
01:51:51,971 --> 01:51:54,940
You made me win by making
my prediction come true.

1249
01:51:56,843 --> 01:51:59,869
Let me tell this good news
to people back at home,

1250
01:52:00,080 --> 01:52:02,207
only then I'll feel better.

1251
01:52:05,652 --> 01:52:08,883
So these great men are also here only.

1252
01:52:09,089 --> 01:52:12,320
Good, so you all are living together.

1253
01:52:12,525 --> 01:52:15,653
Then, you'll clean leftovers all your life.

1254
01:52:16,563 --> 01:52:18,360
They show many things on TV,

1255
01:52:18,565 --> 01:52:24,094
why don't they show them to tell going
against parents will end like this?

1256
01:52:24,871 --> 01:52:27,431
At least few lazy people will reform.

1257
01:52:28,908 --> 01:52:31,399
We needn't shop anything, let's go.

1258
01:52:33,079 --> 01:52:35,138
Wherever I go my ill fate follows me.

1259
01:52:43,189 --> 01:52:48,183
Forget it... who scolded you?
Your father, leave it.

1260
01:52:48,762 --> 01:52:50,559
I'm not sad for scolding me,

1261
01:52:51,030 --> 01:52:52,622
though I'm angry on him,

1262
01:52:53,066 --> 01:52:57,662
when I suddenly saw him
my heart went for him,

1263
01:52:58,271 --> 01:53:00,262
I thought he would also feel the same,

1264
01:53:00,640 --> 01:53:05,270
but he said he was happy
for winning against me,

1265
01:53:06,079 --> 01:53:07,910
it really hurt me more.

1266
01:53:46,920 --> 01:53:48,785
Why are you delaying it still mason?

1267
01:53:48,988 --> 01:53:50,148
Time is already 6 p.m... 

1268
01:53:50,356 --> 01:53:52,051
I must hand over the stage by 7 p.m... 

1269
01:53:52,258 --> 01:53:55,193
It'll be over in 5 minutes.
- Do it fast. - Okay sir.

1270
01:53:55,995 --> 01:53:56,723
Greetings sir.

1271
01:53:56,930 --> 01:53:59,091
Who are you?
What do you want?

1272
01:53:59,766 --> 01:54:04,726
Need a chance to sing
in your auditorium. - Who? You?

1273
01:54:04,971 --> 01:54:06,871
Not me, for my friend.

1274
01:54:07,106 --> 01:54:10,337
Friend? Did he give any programs earlier?

1275
01:54:10,610 --> 01:54:11,542
Who is his Guru?

1276
01:54:11,978 --> 01:54:13,275
He doesn't have any Guru.

1277
01:54:13,513 --> 01:54:15,071
He learnt it on his own,

1278
01:54:15,281 --> 01:54:17,977
if you give him a chance,
he'll become a great singer.

1279
01:54:18,184 --> 01:54:19,742
He has great talent.

1280
01:54:20,353 --> 01:54:26,223
You're talking very silly,
do you know the value of this stage?

1281
01:54:26,459 --> 01:54:33,160
If great singers like Mangalampalli,
Yesudas, SPB sing here,

1282
01:54:33,366 --> 01:54:35,926
people will throng the auditorium
and we'll make the moolah.

1283
01:54:36,135 --> 01:54:41,596
If street singers sing here,
only we both will be the audience.

1284
01:54:43,042 --> 01:54:48,571
First try to get a chance
with light music group, go.

1285
01:54:48,781 --> 01:54:50,510
I'll go home and come back,

1286
01:54:50,717 --> 01:54:52,412
you finish it fast.
- Okay sir.

1287
01:54:53,486 --> 01:54:54,783
Faster... 

1288
01:54:54,988 --> 01:54:59,857
Please sir, don't deny me
the chance sir... - Get up... get up.

1289
01:55:00,226 --> 01:55:02,160
Why are you falling at my feet?

1290
01:55:02,495 --> 01:55:06,898
If you give us one chance,
it's like giving him a life.

1291
01:55:07,267 --> 01:55:10,293
Please, grant my friend a new life sir.

1292
01:55:11,271 --> 01:55:12,761
What's this?

1293
01:55:13,406 --> 01:55:16,239
I'm not the boss here.

1294
01:55:16,576 --> 01:55:18,806
I'm just an ordinary manager.

1295
01:55:19,345 --> 01:55:24,146
It's not so easy to perform
here as you think.

1296
01:55:24,350 --> 01:55:27,319
You know the rent? Rs.60000!

1297
01:55:27,620 --> 01:55:31,989
It'll reach Rs.90000 with current
and maintenance charges.

1298
01:55:32,191 --> 01:55:34,716
Who will pay for it?

1299
01:55:35,261 --> 01:55:38,628
You mean if I pay it,
can he sing here? - Can you bear it?

1300
01:55:39,399 --> 01:55:40,195
I can sir.

1301
01:55:40,566 --> 01:55:43,626
Okay, you fell at my feet for your friend,

1302
01:55:43,903 --> 01:55:46,497
I must help you for your friendship.

1303
01:55:46,940 --> 01:55:50,000
I'll talk to Secretary and
get his permission,

1304
01:55:50,209 --> 01:55:51,801
you arrange for the money,

1305
01:55:52,245 --> 01:55:53,371
but please don't delay it.

1306
01:55:53,579 --> 01:55:55,877
No sir, I'll pay immediately.

1307
01:55:56,382 --> 01:55:57,110
Go.

1308
01:56:05,291 --> 01:56:08,920
One more request.
- What's it?

1309
01:56:09,963 --> 01:56:13,694
Please don't tell my friends
that I've sold the hotel.

1310
01:56:17,570 --> 01:56:22,303
I'll continue working here
as I was doing earlier.

1311
01:56:23,042 --> 01:56:26,500
It'll be very helpful
if you pay me salary.

1312
01:56:29,816 --> 01:56:32,148
Thanks sir, bye.

1313
01:56:37,590 --> 01:56:39,023
What have you done?

1314
01:56:39,525 --> 01:56:40,924
What's your intention?

1315
01:56:41,494 --> 01:56:43,052
There's a limit for sacrifice too.

1316
01:56:43,763 --> 01:56:48,564
You worked hard to start this hotel
and is your source of livelihood,

1317
01:56:48,768 --> 01:56:52,397
if you sell it for their sake,
what will you be left with?

1318
01:56:52,605 --> 01:56:56,166
I've my friends with me,
what else can I wish for?

1319
01:56:56,843 --> 01:57:01,542
I'm telling you from my heart,
never trust anyone.

1320
01:57:01,748 --> 01:57:05,741
No sir, what we sincerely believe
in our heart will come true.

1321
01:57:06,219 --> 01:57:08,517
If we believe good will happen,
good will happen.

1322
01:57:08,721 --> 01:57:10,416
Is it enough if we believe it?

1323
01:57:10,623 --> 01:57:12,591
Where can we find good men now?

1324
01:57:12,792 --> 01:57:17,024
We can't sir because everyone
wants to see good men,

1325
01:57:17,730 --> 01:57:19,789
but nobody wants to be a good man.

1326
01:57:27,874 --> 01:57:33,506
I suggested for your good,
do as you wish.

1327
01:58:10,149 --> 01:58:13,209
On the way, I'll be in the
theatre in 10 minutes.

1328
01:58:14,921 --> 01:58:17,890
Why it turns red when we come?

1329
01:58:18,691 --> 01:58:21,285
Saraswathi Gana Sabha, singer Raja... 

1330
01:58:22,261 --> 01:58:24,889
Who's playing the music for Raja's song?
- Me!

1331
01:58:25,098 --> 01:58:27,760
How dare you play music for his song?

1332
01:58:27,967 --> 01:58:32,165
Isn't Raja your assistant?
- Who said he's my assistant?

1333
01:58:33,506 --> 01:58:37,408
If you play music for his song,
you can never enter my studio again,

1334
01:58:37,677 --> 01:58:39,008
I'll be there in 5 minutes,

1335
01:58:39,212 --> 01:58:41,407
you must leave the auditorium
with your instruments.

1336
01:58:41,614 --> 01:58:43,809
I'm leaving immediately sir.

1337
01:58:44,684 --> 01:58:48,245
Pack your equipment and
leave the place.

1338
01:58:48,454 --> 01:58:50,979
Raja is just an office boy
not an assistant.

1339
01:58:51,190 --> 01:58:53,488
He doesn't know anything about music.
- What happened sir?

1340
01:58:53,693 --> 01:58:56,457
We are not doing your program.
What are you watching?

1341
01:58:57,463 --> 01:59:00,557
Leave the place.
Come... come... 

1342
01:59:03,669 --> 01:59:05,136
I expected this to happen.

1343
01:59:05,338 --> 01:59:06,999
Why are you leaving sir?

1344
01:59:07,540 --> 01:59:09,167
Will you cheat us claiming
yourself as Lahari's assistant?

1345
01:59:09,375 --> 01:59:12,606
We'll not play for you.
- Sir, it's my life.

1346
01:59:12,812 --> 01:59:14,609
If I show pity I may lose my life.

1347
01:59:15,014 --> 01:59:19,883
Please come sir, all are here.
- Can't you understand me?

1348
01:59:20,086 --> 01:59:20,950
How many times do I've to tell you?

1349
01:59:21,154 --> 01:59:23,782
If I play for office boys,
I'll end up as a office boy.

1350
01:59:23,990 --> 01:59:25,321
I don't want to sing!

1351
01:59:38,571 --> 01:59:39,435
What happened?

1352
01:59:40,006 --> 01:59:42,634
Didn't I tell you I'm ill fated?

1353
01:59:42,842 --> 01:59:44,469
I'll go away, leave me alone.

1354
01:59:44,844 --> 01:59:45,742
Where will you go?

1355
01:59:45,945 --> 01:59:47,242
What great fate?

1356
01:59:47,547 --> 01:59:49,139
You must make your own destiny.

1357
01:59:49,348 --> 01:59:53,444
You came here to sing,
not to sing for their music.

1358
01:59:54,120 --> 01:59:56,748
Can't you sing without them?
Can't you?

1359
02:00:09,202 --> 02:00:13,696
You claimed great talent in mimicry,
show your talent now.

1360
02:00:14,907 --> 02:00:17,876
You brought us to a free program
trying to save money on film.

1361
02:00:18,077 --> 02:00:19,203
See the result.

1362
02:00:27,453 --> 02:00:30,547
Orchestra left, where is the
music coming from?

1363
02:00:38,764 --> 02:00:40,322
He's playing music with mouth.

1364
02:00:43,069 --> 02:00:53,035
BHAVANI

1365
02:01:04,490 --> 02:01:12,295
Our first song is welcoming
you with a tune... 

1366
02:01:15,835 --> 02:01:19,566
Our song is our celestial garden... 

1367
02:01:19,872 --> 02:01:23,933
Our song is our new dawn... 

1368
02:01:28,214 --> 02:01:38,180
BHAVANI

1369
02:01:51,203 --> 02:01:58,507
Our song will enchant you
like the fragrance of jasmine... 

1370
02:01:58,878 --> 02:02:06,011
Our song will tickle your youth
and tease you... 

1371
02:02:06,218 --> 02:02:13,181
It waited foryears to
get your approval... 

1372
02:02:13,392 --> 02:02:17,351
Your applause will give it life... 

1373
02:02:23,469 --> 02:02:33,435
BHAVANI

1374
02:03:25,297 --> 02:03:27,094
Songs are our day and night... 

1375
02:03:27,299 --> 02:03:29,096
Even our breath is in rhythm... 

1376
02:03:29,301 --> 02:03:32,600
The day is burden
when we don't sing... 

1377
02:03:34,707 --> 02:03:38,438
Even sorrows melt in
the warmth of songs... 

1378
02:03:38,711 --> 02:03:41,771
Songs lull you like a mother... 

1379
02:03:41,981 --> 02:03:45,439
Though the path is dark... 

1380
02:03:45,718 --> 02:03:49,279
We carry on with hope... 

1381
02:03:49,655 --> 02:03:57,118
Today we are traveling in the
brightness of success... 

1382
02:03:57,329 --> 02:04:01,459
When we have a good friend with us... 

1383
02:04:01,734 --> 02:04:04,965
Affection is ours always... 

1384
02:04:05,171 --> 02:04:08,629
Hats off to your friendship... 

1385
02:04:59,225 --> 02:05:00,351
Don't falter... 

1386
02:05:00,559 --> 02:05:02,527
Climb the Himalayas... 

1387
02:05:06,398 --> 02:05:08,366
Forget hunger and thirst... 

1388
02:05:08,567 --> 02:05:10,194
Focus on your aim only... 

1389
02:05:10,402 --> 02:05:13,530
Don't rest till you achieve
your dream... 

1390
02:05:17,576 --> 02:05:21,205
Wherever the birds may come from... 

1391
02:05:21,413 --> 02:05:25,213
Don't they reach their
destination perfectly... 

1392
02:05:25,417 --> 02:05:32,380
Though tired, don't they cross
oceans to reach the nest... 

1393
02:05:32,591 --> 02:05:40,396
There's determination in birds,
if you learn from it, you can win too... 

1394
02:05:40,599 --> 02:05:44,057
And the world will be in your hands... 

1395
02:06:15,334 --> 02:06:17,632
First rank holder in lAS.

1396
02:06:17,836 --> 02:06:20,134
Did you see Bujji?
Your brother has become Collector.

1397
02:06:20,339 --> 02:06:23,638
I knew it he'll become a Collector.

1398
02:06:23,842 --> 02:06:26,140
Come, let's go and
meet your brother.

1399
02:06:32,751 --> 02:06:37,381
Lord, you fulfilled my wish of
my friends hitting big time.

1400
02:06:38,057 --> 02:06:40,685
Lord, please help me to
come closer to my Ammu.

1401
02:06:40,893 --> 02:06:42,861
I'll never make any wish after that.

1402
02:06:54,039 --> 02:06:59,136
Your friends have achieved
success as you wished.

1403
02:06:59,812 --> 02:07:02,610
I was waiting for this moment.

1404
02:07:03,015 --> 02:07:05,074
I'll open my heart to you now.

1405
02:07:05,851 --> 02:07:08,319
You may be shocked to hear it.

1406
02:07:08,520 --> 02:07:13,981
May be he too wants to
express his love for me.

1407
02:07:20,032 --> 02:07:20,930
My chain!

1408
02:07:22,468 --> 02:07:23,264
My chain!

1409
02:07:27,306 --> 02:07:28,432
Catch him! My chain!

1410
02:07:35,314 --> 02:07:36,440
Stop... stop... 

1411
02:07:38,817 --> 02:07:41,285
Please don't beat me sir,
take your chain.

1412
02:07:45,658 --> 02:07:48,957
This chain! My mother gave it to me.

1413
02:07:51,864 --> 02:07:54,628
Beat him Ganesh,
only then crooks like him will reform.

1414
02:07:54,833 --> 02:07:57,301
Why are you asking me to beat him?

1415
02:07:57,503 --> 02:07:59,971
He has helped me a lot.
In fact I must fall at his feet.

1416
02:08:00,172 --> 02:08:02,299
Brother show me your legs.

1417
02:08:02,508 --> 02:08:04,976
Please leave me sir.

1418
02:08:08,514 --> 02:08:13,144
You bought this chain in
Kalamandir, right? -Yes.

1419
02:08:13,352 --> 02:08:14,478
How do you know that?

1420
02:08:15,354 --> 02:08:16,821
I sold it there.

1421
02:08:18,590 --> 02:08:21,821
You sold it?
-Yes, I sold it.

1422
02:08:22,695 --> 02:08:26,825
Do you know how many nights
I spent sleepless for losing it?

1423
02:08:27,099 --> 02:08:27,656
Why?

1424
02:08:28,500 --> 02:08:32,197
This was a gift from my mother
to her future daughter-in-law.

1425
02:08:38,077 --> 02:08:42,207
In fact I came to Hyderabad for
my uncle's daughter Ammu.

1426
02:08:45,751 --> 02:08:49,710
But uncle who should've accepted
my love and agree to marry her,

1427
02:08:50,322 --> 02:08:51,687
turned against me,

1428
02:08:55,094 --> 02:08:59,224
I didn't see my love for
whom I came here.

1429
02:09:00,332 --> 02:09:04,792
I was adamant in not meeting her but
never forgot her for a moment too.

1430
02:09:05,604 --> 02:09:09,062
Though floods wash away everything,
the smell of soil remains,

1431
02:09:09,341 --> 02:09:11,400
likewise her memories are
always close to my heart.

1432
02:09:11,777 --> 02:09:15,907
I see my 4 year old Ammu
in everything.

1433
02:09:20,352 --> 02:09:24,584
Just now I made a wish with Lord
to help me meet my Ammu.

1434
02:09:24,957 --> 02:09:28,586
By luck I got back
my mother's chain.

1435
02:09:29,128 --> 02:09:32,928
Finding this chain gives me hope
that I'll meet my Ammu.

1436
02:09:33,799 --> 02:09:34,993
I'll surely meet Ammu.

1437
02:09:41,640 --> 02:09:46,543
Will I meet her?
- Sure.

1438
02:09:49,081 --> 02:09:53,541
Can I have this chain?
- With pleasure.

1439
02:09:54,052 --> 02:09:57,044
Let this be my marriage gift to Ammu.

1440
02:10:08,100 --> 02:10:09,965
It's going to rain. I'll leave.

1441
02:10:10,402 --> 02:10:13,132
It's good. You like rain, don't you?

1442
02:10:14,072 --> 02:10:17,974
I don't know. Now I don't like it.
- Okay.

1443
02:10:19,378 --> 02:10:29,344
BHAVANI

1444
02:10:50,175 --> 02:10:55,807
Anjali dear... come fast.

1445
02:10:57,149 --> 02:10:58,377
I'm coming, mom.

1446
02:11:22,875 --> 02:11:25,844
Uncle, she really got scared.

1447
02:11:27,813 --> 02:11:31,681
I should've been in America.
Are you shocked to see me here?

1448
02:11:32,551 --> 02:11:36,351
I've brought a gift for you.

1449
02:11:36,555 --> 02:11:39,183
If you see that,
you will be twice shocked.

1450
02:11:41,960 --> 02:11:43,689
Want to see what it is? See.

1451
02:11:52,504 --> 02:11:56,304
Yes. He wanted to express
his desire personally.

1452
02:11:56,508 --> 02:11:58,806
So, he didn't want me to tell you this.

1453
02:11:59,011 --> 02:12:01,639
That's why I didn't inform you
about his arrival.

1454
02:12:04,349 --> 02:12:10,151
I know you love me.
But I want to hear it from you.

1455
02:12:10,355 --> 02:12:11,982
You like me, don't you?

1456
02:12:12,190 --> 02:12:13,589
What question is that?

1457
02:12:13,859 --> 02:12:17,158
When you called on her birthday,
she felt very happy.

1458
02:12:17,429 --> 02:12:22,662
Now that you've come with the
auspicious thread, she's dumbstruck.

1459
02:12:26,872 --> 02:12:28,737
Why are you silent, Anjali?

1460
02:12:30,709 --> 02:12:31,505
You are interested in this
marriage, aren't you?

1461
02:12:35,747 --> 02:12:41,014
No Rajesh. I'm not interested
in this marriage.

1462
02:12:46,224 --> 02:12:51,025
Anjali, please don't say that.
I can't bear that.

1463
02:12:51,930 --> 02:12:53,295
You are my life.

1464
02:12:53,565 --> 02:12:57,194
Uncle, you tell herthat I love her dearly.

1465
02:13:01,907 --> 02:13:04,375
Do you think only you can
give me shocks?

1466
02:13:05,677 --> 02:13:07,042
How's mine?

1467
02:13:13,151 --> 02:13:14,049
I'm interested in this marriage.

1468
02:13:16,922 --> 02:13:18,719
Uncle, Anjali has agreed.

1469
02:13:20,592 --> 02:13:23,220
How dare you give me a shock?
- No Rajesh.

1470
02:13:23,428 --> 02:13:25,726
No Rajesh.
- Stop Anjali.

1471
02:13:33,171 --> 02:13:35,002
Anjali, better come out.

1472
02:13:35,507 --> 02:13:38,237
Anyway you have to come out.
I'll catch you then.

1473
02:13:38,877 --> 02:13:43,678
Uncle, conduct the marriage this month.
But don't make it an ordinary one.

1474
02:13:44,049 --> 02:13:45,175
It should be very grand.

1475
02:13:45,450 --> 02:13:48,476
Anjali, we will be in US
next month by this time.

1476
02:13:49,054 --> 02:13:50,646
Prepare from now on.

1477
02:13:51,023 --> 02:13:53,685
I'll apply for your visa.

1478
02:14:00,132 --> 02:14:02,362
Aunty, my friends are coming.
- Is it?

1479
02:14:03,802 --> 02:14:04,598
What is it?

1480
02:14:04,803 --> 02:14:06,930
They phoned me that they're coming.
- Go.

1481
02:14:07,139 --> 02:14:09,164
When is Raja coming from America?
- I spoke to them now.

1482
02:14:09,374 --> 02:14:10,602
All three are coming now.

1483
02:14:10,809 --> 02:14:12,276
A function has been organized for them.

1484
02:14:12,477 --> 02:14:16,106
I've lot of work to do.
I will meet you in the evening. Bye.

1485
02:14:27,592 --> 02:14:28,957
How are you?

1486
02:14:29,428 --> 02:14:30,952
Do you know Prasad is
a Collector now?

1487
02:14:31,163 --> 02:14:35,122
That's why I've come here.
You're Parvathi's son, right?

1488
02:14:35,333 --> 02:14:37,198
Yes.
- Why are you here?

1489
02:14:37,636 --> 02:14:41,128
We live together.
- Together?

1490
02:14:41,373 --> 02:14:42,806
What are you doing?

1491
02:14:43,341 --> 02:14:46,139
For the time being, I'm idle.
- Idle...?

1492
02:14:46,511 --> 02:14:49,309
How could one survive in
Hyderabad staying idle?

1493
02:14:49,681 --> 02:14:53,481
So, everything runs on my son's earning?

1494
02:14:53,852 --> 02:14:56,912
I've change everything... 
one by one.

1495
02:14:57,522 --> 02:14:59,990
What house is this?

1496
02:15:00,192 --> 02:15:01,819
How can a Collector stay
in such a house?

1497
02:15:02,027 --> 02:15:04,996
I'm decorating it.
- Keep this inside.

1498
02:15:05,197 --> 02:15:06,164
Come inside.

1499
02:15:17,275 --> 02:15:18,674
I've no change.
- Keep it.

1500
02:15:29,821 --> 02:15:30,913
What's happening here?

1501
02:15:31,490 --> 02:15:32,514
What happened to your love?

1502
02:15:33,558 --> 02:15:37,016
Did you express your love
to Ganesh or not? - No.

1503
02:15:37,229 --> 02:15:37,854
Why?

1504
02:15:47,405 --> 02:15:50,203
But how could you agree for this marriage?

1505
02:15:50,909 --> 02:15:54,037
He hasn't seen her till now.

1506
02:15:54,579 --> 02:15:57,548
Even if he sees her,
she might not like him.

1507
02:15:58,183 --> 02:15:59,878
What if she's married by now?

1508
02:16:02,053 --> 02:16:06,387
You could've waited for
some more time. - No.

1509
02:16:06,858 --> 02:16:11,557
Every minute I wait, I'll pray to God
to make Ganesh mine.

1510
02:16:11,997 --> 02:16:14,056
My prayers shouldn't be
an obstacle for his love.

1511
02:16:15,600 --> 02:16:23,507
I built a fort for Ganesh in my heart.
But he has built a temple for that girl.

1512
02:16:24,342 --> 02:16:26,401
A fort can get destroyed.
Nothing wrong.

1513
02:16:26,945 --> 02:16:31,575
But a temple shouldn't.
So, I agreed for this marriage.

1514
02:16:31,883 --> 02:16:35,979
Now I'm able to pray for his
love whole heartedly.

1515
02:16:38,089 --> 02:16:39,579
Ganesh should never know about all this.

1516
02:16:41,660 --> 02:16:50,364
Long live Raja!
Long live Raja... 

1517
02:16:58,176 --> 02:16:59,905
How are you, Prasad?

1518
02:17:01,947 --> 02:17:03,972
I feel very happy to see you like this.

1519
02:17:04,349 --> 02:17:05,316
How was your journey?

1520
02:17:06,184 --> 02:17:06,809
It's been very long since I saw you.

1521
02:17:07,018 --> 02:17:09,316
Go that side.
I have to cast away evil spells.

1522
02:17:19,030 --> 02:17:21,328
Get me the garlands.

1523
02:17:23,268 --> 02:17:24,496
Now you're my son.

1524
02:17:26,037 --> 02:17:28,335
He is just like me when I was young.

1525
02:17:33,545 --> 02:17:34,170
Brother... 

1526
02:17:34,379 --> 02:17:36,347
Hey Bujji... good to see you here.

1527
02:17:39,384 --> 02:17:40,351
How are you?
- Fine.

1528
02:17:40,552 --> 02:17:45,182
Prasad, get her down.
She isn't a little girl anymore.

1529
02:17:45,557 --> 02:17:46,524
She's grown up.

1530
02:17:47,659 --> 02:17:57,625
BHAVANI

1531
02:18:05,577 --> 02:18:07,636
How can we make them
stand here and talk?

1532
02:18:07,846 --> 02:18:11,907
Let's go upstairs.
- Come, let's go.

1533
02:18:15,086 --> 02:18:18,783
Look at my friends.
They look very good in those clothes.

1534
02:18:19,424 --> 02:18:22,723
Yes, I'm looking at them.
But I don't see what you told me.

1535
02:18:23,495 --> 02:18:26,123
I only see your hardship for them.

1536
02:18:26,698 --> 02:18:28,325
It's enough they remember that.

1537
02:18:28,967 --> 02:18:32,903
Okay. It's been very long since you all met.
Go and attend them.

1538
02:18:33,104 --> 02:18:35,004
I've some work.
I will meet you later.

1539
02:18:36,608 --> 02:18:39,236
Look. Keep his luggage inside.
Come. - Okay.

1540
02:18:55,727 --> 02:18:57,422
Where were you?
Boys are very tired.

1541
02:18:57,629 --> 02:18:58,926
Why don't you get them
something to drink?

1542
02:18:59,464 --> 02:19:01,091
I forgot. I'll get it now.

1543
02:19:01,299 --> 02:19:04,928
I'll keep the luggage inside.
You go and get them soft drinks.

1544
02:19:05,136 --> 02:19:05,761
I'll be back soon.

1545
02:19:07,072 --> 02:19:10,508
I always talk about you in our village.

1546
02:19:10,809 --> 02:19:14,768
We can't live in this Hyderabad.

1547
02:19:17,649 --> 02:19:18,616
I'll consult him and tell you.

1548
02:19:19,317 --> 02:19:21,785
Sir, they want to know when you will
go to the company guest house.

1549
02:19:22,654 --> 02:19:24,121
When shall we go to the guest house?

1550
02:19:24,322 --> 02:19:28,952
Why would my son go there?
Now he is a Collector.

1551
02:19:29,527 --> 02:19:33,463
Government has given us a big house.
We will go there.

1552
02:19:35,567 --> 02:19:39,128
What are you talking?
Do you know who my son is?

1553
02:19:39,504 --> 02:19:44,965
A famous singer in India.
How will his bungalow be?

1554
02:19:45,343 --> 02:19:49,302
A royal palace.
How could you reject that?

1555
02:19:49,581 --> 02:19:51,139
You son might be a Collector.

1556
02:19:51,416 --> 02:19:54,146
But will a government house
look better than ours?

1557
02:19:55,353 --> 02:19:59,483
Stop praising your son.

1558
02:19:59,691 --> 02:20:01,989
Without my son, your son doesn't exist.

1559
02:20:02,427 --> 02:20:06,329
The entire country is praising
my son's talent.

1560
02:20:07,632 --> 02:20:12,228
It's because of my son
you've got this name and fame.

1561
02:20:13,471 --> 02:20:16,838
Ask your company and
get a separate bungalow.

1562
02:20:17,041 --> 02:20:19,509
No one should disturb us there.

1563
02:20:19,711 --> 02:20:22,009
If someone comes there... 

1564
02:20:24,048 --> 02:20:25,015
Where are you going, Priya?

1565
02:20:25,550 --> 02:20:26,574
I'm going back home.

1566
02:20:26,818 --> 02:20:27,842
Why?

1567
02:20:28,453 --> 02:20:32,514
Ganesh, I've family friends.
But I don't know what a family is.

1568
02:20:32,891 --> 02:20:35,359
I grew up in a hostel like an orphan.

1569
02:20:35,727 --> 02:20:39,128
Here I saw 4 friends living
like a family.

1570
02:20:39,564 --> 02:20:44,934
I felt very happy to become
a part of that family.

1571
02:20:46,070 --> 02:20:47,594
Now I think it will not happen.

1572
02:20:48,907 --> 02:20:50,033
What do you mean?

1573
02:20:50,575 --> 02:20:55,706
I fear that you all might get separated.

1574
02:20:56,748 --> 02:20:57,772
That will never happen.

1575
02:20:57,982 --> 02:21:00,610
No Ganesh.
You don't know what's happening.

1576
02:21:01,252 --> 02:21:05,382
If Prasad agrees for separation,
I will not marry him.

1577
02:21:06,090 --> 02:21:06,556
Listen... 

1578
02:21:06,758 --> 02:21:09,386
Don't try to convince me.
My decision is final.

1579
02:21:22,173 --> 02:21:23,731
Hi Anjali! Welcome.

1580
02:21:24,542 --> 02:21:27,568
I heard that Raja, Vijay and
Prasad are back.

1581
02:21:27,779 --> 02:21:29,246
Where are they? I don't see them.

1582
02:21:29,848 --> 02:21:32,078
Their parents have come.
They have gone for shopping.

1583
02:21:32,550 --> 02:21:34,415
Who is he?

1584
02:21:38,289 --> 02:21:39,313
Shall I tell him who I am?

1585
02:21:41,292 --> 02:21:44,193
I'm going to marry Anjali and
take her away to America.

1586
02:21:44,395 --> 02:21:48,422
Marriage? You never told me.

1587
02:21:50,802 --> 02:21:55,102
You're very lucky.
You're very lucky to marry Anjali.

1588
02:21:57,308 --> 02:21:58,673
When is your marriage?

1589
02:22:00,178 --> 02:22:03,614
15th...? Can you postpone
your marriage for a day?

1590
02:22:03,815 --> 02:22:04,281
Why?

1591
02:22:05,116 --> 02:22:08,779
Our friends function is on coming 14th.
You both must come.

1592
02:22:08,987 --> 02:22:11,455
How is it possible?
Our engagement is on that day.

1593
02:22:11,990 --> 02:22:14,788
Since it's a live program,
we will watch it on TV.

1594
02:22:15,660 --> 02:22:19,619
Forget about our marriage, when will you
introduce your uncle's daughter?

1595
02:22:20,031 --> 02:22:21,123
Before you fly to America.

1596
02:22:21,399 --> 02:22:23,697
After the function gets over,
we will go to our uncle's house.

1597
02:22:24,068 --> 02:22:26,969
As you said, you must seek
her hand for me.

1598
02:22:28,339 --> 02:22:29,237
Will you come?

1599
02:22:31,476 --> 02:22:33,637
Can I also come?
- With pleasure.

1600
02:22:34,512 --> 02:22:37,811
Sorry for making you stand.
Come and sit. - No Ganesh.

1601
02:22:38,283 --> 02:22:40,717
We're going to Bangalore
to invite his friends.

1602
02:22:40,852 --> 02:22:43,218
Once we're back, we will meet you
with the invitation card. - Okay.

1603
02:23:30,435 --> 02:23:33,165
This is our Raja's function.
We must attend this function.

1604
02:23:33,605 --> 02:23:34,833
Okay. Sure.

1605
02:23:37,241 --> 02:23:47,207
BHAVANI

1606
02:23:54,959 --> 02:23:56,085
You need a garland now.

1607
02:23:57,962 --> 02:23:59,589
Hello bride, aren't you ready?

1608
02:24:00,031 --> 02:24:02,090
Wait Rajesh.
Let's watch the program and go.

1609
02:24:03,067 --> 02:24:04,261
Even I came to see this program.

1610
02:24:08,473 --> 02:24:09,872
Now you look like a bride.

1611
02:24:12,377 --> 02:24:17,610
Now you're going to watch the
''Young Achievers Awards Function'' live.

1612
02:24:24,322 --> 02:24:29,350
As you said, the audience, the stage
... the function is very grand.

1613
02:24:30,094 --> 02:24:34,030
I welcome you all for
attending this function.

1614
02:24:34,232 --> 02:24:39,693
We humbly request those
achievers to come to the stage.

1615
02:24:40,672 --> 02:24:43,835
Your friends will invite you to the
stage to say a few words.

1616
02:24:44,042 --> 02:24:46,772
Don't feel shy to talk.

1617
02:24:46,978 --> 02:24:48,707
I don't need all that.

1618
02:24:48,913 --> 02:24:50,540
Stop talking like a fool.

1619
02:24:50,748 --> 02:24:54,684
The audience are happily
sitting on the chair.

1620
02:24:54,886 --> 02:24:57,116
How could you say that?

1621
02:24:57,321 --> 02:25:00,950
You're the only one who has the
right to talk on the stage.

1622
02:25:01,159 --> 02:25:02,854
You must get on to the stage and talk.

1623
02:25:03,061 --> 02:25:04,187
And I want to watch that.

1624
02:25:11,936 --> 02:25:12,994
Long live Raja!

1625
02:25:13,204 --> 02:25:14,432
Long live Prasad!

1626
02:25:14,639 --> 02:25:16,129
Long live Vijay!

1627
02:25:23,514 --> 02:25:25,505
Raja will speak first.

1628
02:25:29,120 --> 02:25:30,417
He is my son.

1629
02:25:36,394 --> 02:25:40,694
Our thanks for your love and support.

1630
02:25:41,466 --> 02:25:45,766
We're very happy to see
you honouring us.

1631
02:25:46,070 --> 02:25:51,133
But we aren't the actual people
who should get this honour.

1632
02:25:53,845 --> 02:25:57,975
Behind every successful man
lies a great power.

1633
02:25:58,316 --> 02:26:00,944
There is a great power
behind our success.

1634
02:26:04,655 --> 02:26:07,021
That power saw the talent in us

1635
02:26:07,225 --> 02:26:12,993
and motivated us every moment
to reach greater heights.

1636
02:26:13,197 --> 02:26:15,256
It has brought us to this stage.

1637
02:26:15,466 --> 02:26:17,127
It's none other than... 

1638
02:26:22,840 --> 02:26:23,932
... our parents.

1639
02:26:34,452 --> 02:26:35,316
Yes.

1640
02:26:35,787 --> 02:26:38,255
Without them we couldn't
have achieved this.

1641
02:26:38,456 --> 02:26:42,756
So, we like to receive this
award from their hands.

1642
02:26:45,797 --> 02:26:46,991
Please come, Step mother.

1643
02:26:49,367 --> 02:26:50,698
Father please.

1644
02:26:51,969 --> 02:26:52,901
Father please.

1645
02:26:53,404 --> 02:26:54,302
Come.

1646
02:27:30,508 --> 02:27:31,202
What's happening Anjali?

1647
02:27:31,409 --> 02:27:36,711
We now request Mr. Prasad,
the Collector to say a few words.

1648
02:27:41,853 --> 02:27:44,185
How did they change
all of a sudden?

1649
02:27:44,689 --> 02:27:46,088
This is unjust.

1650
02:27:46,791 --> 02:27:51,023
I told you several time that
they will bring you to streets.

1651
02:27:51,229 --> 02:27:52,321
They have done it.
It's over.

1652
02:27:52,530 --> 02:27:54,555
We can't stay here anymore.

1653
02:27:54,765 --> 02:27:55,561
Let's go.

1654
02:27:55,766 --> 02:27:56,664
Why are you angry?

1655
02:27:56,868 --> 02:27:57,664
What happened?

1656
02:27:57,869 --> 02:27:59,359
What more do you want to happen?

1657
02:27:59,570 --> 02:28:01,902
You might be a great soul
to tolerate such things.

1658
02:28:02,106 --> 02:28:02,663
But I am not.

1659
02:28:02,874 --> 02:28:04,171
Let's go.

1660
02:28:05,376 --> 02:28:07,503
Trying to create problems
in this function?

1661
02:28:07,712 --> 02:28:10,180
See if you want to.
Else get out.

1662
02:28:10,381 --> 02:28:11,177
Go.

1663
02:28:11,382 --> 02:28:14,180
Go ahead. Chase us out.

1664
02:28:14,552 --> 02:28:17,350
See how well we are honoured here.

1665
02:28:17,555 --> 02:28:21,685
If I stay here anymore,
I'll turn into a killer.

1666
02:28:21,893 --> 02:28:22,689
Let's go.

1667
02:28:23,027 --> 02:28:24,358
Don't tell me anything.
- Listen to me.

1668
02:28:24,562 --> 02:28:26,530
Yesterday's dream is today's reality

1669
02:28:26,731 --> 02:28:28,494
and tomorrow's achievement.

1670
02:28:28,766 --> 02:28:30,825
This is very much true in our lives.

1671
02:28:31,035 --> 02:28:33,265
This stage, this very moment

1672
02:28:33,471 --> 02:28:38,499
and receiving the award from our parents
was our 15 year old dream.

1673
02:28:38,709 --> 02:28:41,041
We didn't want our dream
to remain a dream.

1674
02:28:41,178 --> 02:28:44,739
So, we said our parents are
responsible for our success.

1675
02:28:45,249 --> 02:28:47,740
But truth is they are not
the real motivators.

1676
02:28:53,724 --> 02:28:57,182
Truth is we were a burden to them.

1677
02:28:57,395 --> 02:28:59,886
We were once called wastrels.

1678
02:29:03,067 --> 02:29:03,863
Yes.

1679
02:29:04,168 --> 02:29:06,398
My father was never a father to me.

1680
02:29:06,604 --> 02:29:09,437
His step mother was never
a mother to him.

1681
02:29:09,774 --> 02:29:11,241
But someone who came
from no where

1682
02:29:11,442 --> 02:29:17,347
was like a mother, a father,
a friend and was God to us.

1683
02:29:22,820 --> 02:29:26,415
In fact, he should've been
on the stage.

1684
02:29:26,757 --> 02:29:32,559
But he is standing in a corner
with a noble heart.

1685
02:29:38,903 --> 02:29:42,600
Friends come and
go in everyone's life.

1686
02:29:42,807 --> 02:29:45,935
But for us, a friend gave us life.

1687
02:29:49,413 --> 02:29:51,278
We fed him only a square meal.

1688
02:29:51,482 --> 02:29:54,940
But he cleaned plates and
brought us to this level.

1689
02:30:10,001 --> 02:30:12,731
You all must know who that friend is.

1690
02:30:40,398 --> 02:30:43,128
He is our friend Ganesh.

1691
02:30:45,870 --> 02:30:49,101
Everyone is appreciating us
for making it big.

1692
02:30:49,306 --> 02:30:54,573
If you get a friend like him,
you can also do it.

1693
02:30:56,714 --> 02:31:00,514
We don't want to hurt or insult you.

1694
02:31:00,718 --> 02:31:06,884
It's for the parents to understand
the feelings of the youth like us.

1695
02:31:11,462 --> 02:31:14,022
If you don't believe in
your children's talent,

1696
02:31:14,231 --> 02:31:15,994
how will others believe in them?

1697
02:31:19,670 --> 02:31:27,236
Every parent wants their child to achieve
something which they couldn't.

1698
02:31:27,445 --> 02:31:31,006
But no one wants to know
the child's interest.

1699
02:31:34,085 --> 02:31:38,545
You might think that we are
proud of ourselves and our victory.

1700
02:31:38,756 --> 02:31:41,816
But we're very sad to say this
with a heavy heart.

1701
02:31:42,026 --> 02:31:44,290
Truth is we are not happy.

1702
02:31:45,396 --> 02:31:47,887
After coming back,
I took my sister into my arms.

1703
02:31:48,099 --> 02:31:51,535
But you said she's no more a little girl
and told me leave her down.

1704
02:31:52,770 --> 02:31:57,139
We can fondle with a sister
only for a few years.

1705
02:31:57,341 --> 02:31:58,706
Will those days come back?

1706
02:31:58,909 --> 02:32:01,707
Can we get back our lost happiness?

1707
02:32:06,650 --> 02:32:07,912
Without the support of parents,

1708
02:32:08,119 --> 02:32:09,484
wasting the talent,

1709
02:32:09,687 --> 02:32:11,052
losing such happiness,

1710
02:32:11,255 --> 02:32:14,053
do you know how many are
wandering like dead souls?

1711
02:32:14,258 --> 02:32:15,691
Why is this happening?

1712
02:32:16,127 --> 02:32:18,595
Because parents don't understand
their children properly.

1713
02:32:23,801 --> 02:32:27,760
Since we got a good friend,
we could come up in life.

1714
02:32:27,972 --> 02:32:29,837
Can everyone get a friend like him?

1715
02:32:30,374 --> 02:32:32,535
You tried to push him aside.

1716
02:32:34,411 --> 02:32:37,972
We would've said this
when you all insulted him.

1717
02:32:38,182 --> 02:32:42,118
But only you people would've
known his greatness.

1718
02:32:42,319 --> 02:32:46,722
We want this world to know
about a friend like him.

1719
02:32:46,924 --> 02:32:48,516
That's why we're saying this on stage.

1720
02:32:48,726 --> 02:32:51,194
Without any expectation,

1721
02:32:51,395 --> 02:32:55,297
a relation which will even
sacrifice life is friendship.

1722
02:32:58,002 --> 02:33:00,436
Nowadays people forget
the good deeds for love.

1723
02:33:00,638 --> 02:33:02,970
But he gave up love
for thanksgiving.

1724
02:33:03,174 --> 02:33:05,938
No money can equal his sacrifice.

1725
02:33:06,410 --> 02:33:08,970
Our small help we can do for him... 

1726
02:33:09,180 --> 02:33:12,377
... is to unite his uncle's
daughter Ammu with him.

1727
02:33:20,257 --> 02:33:21,622
Anjali told me everything.

1728
02:33:25,930 --> 02:33:29,661
Neither him nor we know
how she looks like.

1729
02:33:29,934 --> 02:33:33,631
Her childhood photo is
all that we have.

1730
02:33:35,673 --> 02:33:42,875
Ammu, he has all the love in this
world for you in his heart

1731
02:33:43,080 --> 02:33:48,017
and is waiting for the past 15 years.

1732
02:33:49,019 --> 02:33:52,079
See how you are in his heart.

1733
02:34:27,725 --> 02:34:31,320
Anjali, everyone is waiting
for the engagement.

1734
02:34:31,528 --> 02:34:34,827
But you both are busy watching TV.

1735
02:34:42,172 --> 02:34:48,577
Since he was poor, his uncle snatched
his relationship with him.

1736
02:34:48,779 --> 02:34:51,441
We're telling you now. Listen.

1737
02:34:51,649 --> 02:34:56,916
All our wealth, fame and name
belongs to him.

1738
02:34:57,121 --> 02:35:01,251
Please unite him with his Ammu.

1739
02:35:06,130 --> 02:35:08,598
Our friend is God to us
because he gave us a new life.

1740
02:35:08,799 --> 02:35:11,996
Since you're going to give him
a new life, you're also God to us.

1741
02:35:12,870 --> 02:35:15,168
Please come here
wherever you might be.

1742
02:35:17,808 --> 02:35:22,939
You might be here or might be
watching this program on TV.

1743
02:35:23,147 --> 02:35:26,548
Wherever you are,
please come here.

1744
02:35:26,750 --> 02:35:29,412
Make my friend Ganesh's love win.

1745
02:35:33,891 --> 02:35:39,386
Only you can bring your Ammu here,
no matter where she is.

1746
02:35:39,596 --> 02:35:43,532
Call her.
Call her I say.

1747
02:35:44,835 --> 02:35:45,859
Call her.

1748
02:35:55,846 --> 02:35:59,805
No uncle. Let her go.

1749
02:36:14,198 --> 02:36:17,326
Call her.

1750
02:36:26,977 --> 02:36:31,277
Your Ammu is here.

1751
02:37:21,064 --> 02:37:27,367
If parents are their children's first friend,
every youth is an achiever. - K. Shajahan
