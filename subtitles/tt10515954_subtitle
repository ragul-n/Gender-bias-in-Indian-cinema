1
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:54,049
- Olissia

2
00:02:56,842 --> 00:03:05,497
(Piano playing)

3
00:03:56,998 --> 00:03:59,131
Can't you stop it at least now?

4
00:04:00,451 --> 00:04:03,466
It's been many years since we started to hear and listen this.

5
00:04:03,748 --> 00:04:04,748
Oh! My God.!

6
00:04:09,524 --> 00:04:10,857
Breakfast is ready.

7
00:04:51,818 --> 00:04:57,193
On the shoulders of a little dream,

8
00:04:57,404 --> 00:05:02,013
Will you please rest?

9
00:05:02,248 --> 00:05:07,568
On the body of a little star,

10
00:05:07,834 --> 00:05:12,325
Will sing lullaby

11
00:05:12,638 --> 00:05:22,945
On the shoulders of a little dream, 
Will you please rest?

12
00:05:23,094 --> 00:05:33,461
On the body of a little star, 
I will sing lullaby.

13
00:05:33,539 --> 00:05:43,859
You became a companion and support 
as my dream.

14
00:05:43,891 --> 00:05:54,414
On the shoulders of a little dream, 
Will you please rest?

15
00:05:54,438 --> 00:06:05,547
On the body of a little star, 
I will sing lullaby.

16
00:06:09,391 --> 00:06:13,070
Unni. 
My only Unnikannan.

17
00:06:13,563 --> 00:06:16,531
The pain of my forever trembling mind

18
00:06:16,563 --> 00:06:22,062
On the shoulders of a little dream, 
resting every day listening to my lullaby

19
00:06:22,087 --> 00:06:24,672
Mine Unni. 
(Kisses.)

20
00:06:48,047 --> 00:06:51,521
Only for you,

21
00:06:51,545 --> 00:06:58,091
blooming in my memory

22
00:06:58,654 --> 00:07:05,466
Trembles mind's pain

23
00:07:08,935 --> 00:07:25,427
Only for you, 
blooming in my memory, 
trembling mind's pain

24
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:35,031
You're alone in my dreams.

25
00:07:35,055 --> 00:07:40,367
In reality, I'm alone.

26
00:07:40,407 --> 00:07:49,719
You're alone in my dreams. 
In my reality, I'm alone.

27
00:07:49,813 --> 00:07:54,891
Let's have a swing. 
Will you come.

28
00:07:55,008 --> 00:07:59,601
I'll turn out to be a lullaby in music.

29
00:08:02,329 --> 00:08:12,641
On the shoulders of a little dream, 
Will you please rest?

30
00:08:12,719 --> 00:08:23,734
On the body of a little star, 
I will sing lullaby.

31
00:08:56,063 --> 00:09:01,180
Quivering heart's rhythm

32
00:09:01,243 --> 00:09:06,156
In departing memories

33
00:09:06,454 --> 00:09:14,414
Scattering Rose pot.

34
00:09:16,868 --> 00:09:21,992
I'm alone in darkness.

35
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:27,312
Tears alone.

36
00:09:27,383 --> 00:09:36,430
I'm alone in darkness. 
Tears alone.

37
00:09:36,508 --> 00:09:41,664
Will you ever come along to a dreamy nestle.

38
00:09:41,797 --> 00:09:46,406
Gift you a kiss, will you be mine?

39
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:58,445
On the shoulders of a little dream, 
Will you please rest?

40
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:09,359
On the body of a little star, 
I will sing lullaby.

41
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:20,258
You became a companion and support 
as my dream.

42
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:30,555
On the shoulders of a little dream, 
Will you please rest?

43
00:10:32,547 --> 00:10:43,437
On the body of a little star, 
I will sing lullaby.

44
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:06,870
Oleessia

45
00:11:07,784 --> 00:11:09,245
- Oleessia 
- Yes dear. What is it?

46
00:11:09,649 --> 00:11:12,133
- Uncle, is there Oleessia? 
- Yes, she's inside.

47
00:11:39,498 --> 00:11:42,654
Every one is on leave today. 
Shall we go for an outing?

48
00:11:43,506 --> 00:11:44,506
- No

49
00:11:58,125 --> 00:11:59,192
What is it dear?

50
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:07,109
My sadness is my happiness.

51
00:12:09,805 --> 00:12:12,687
And, it's much in this room.

52
00:12:15,422 --> 00:12:19,187
I don't like an outing for enjoyment, Jessica.

53
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,120
Oleessia

54
00:12:24,299 --> 00:12:28,518
Like you, if life is just a pain of the past like...

55
00:12:28,972 --> 00:12:31,003
None can really come out.

56
00:12:31,823 --> 00:12:33,223
Just forget the past.

57
00:12:33,974 --> 00:12:34,974
Life of the present

58
00:12:44,868 --> 00:12:46,734
Oleessia, please...

59
00:14:22,581 --> 00:14:25,448
Come dear, please. 
No tension.

60
00:14:46,678 --> 00:14:49,865
Excuse me sir. 
Yes, come in.

61
00:14:50,039 --> 00:14:51,039
(Phone ringing)

62
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:02,922
Let her die. It is good for everyone

63
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:05,610
Okay.

64
00:15:05,753 --> 00:15:06,753
Alright.

65
00:15:14,597 --> 00:15:17,440
Olissia. Schizophrenia

66
00:15:32,678 --> 00:15:36,333
The children born here, 30 out of 100, are mad.

67
00:15:37,131 --> 00:15:42,740
Among them, some will be the society through Art and literature.

68
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,976
In some others, It'll grow as a greed for money.

69
00:15:47,573 --> 00:15:52,620
Without looking for a way to the destiny, they'll wait like wolves.

70
00:15:53,029 --> 00:15:57,747
And, still some others, will hand over their life to the madness and find content in it.

71
00:16:02,443 --> 00:16:05,244
Good. 
Everything is for good.

72
00:16:33,487 --> 00:16:34,432
One of my patients

73
00:16:35,308 --> 00:16:36,308
Passed away.

74
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,503
That's correct. 
No money.

75
00:16:39,276 --> 00:16:41,838
No treatment for those who who have no money.

76
00:16:42,386 --> 00:16:44,198
That's the adage of the modernity.

77
00:16:45,323 --> 00:16:49,823
Today's medical industry is a constant battle between money and fate.

78
00:16:50,823 --> 00:16:55,659
Olissia, you, yourself, are the reason behind your illness.

79
00:16:56,498 --> 00:17:03,377
In your mind's shade of love, the emotion of Unni 
that's well nurtured by you, has already grown as a poisonous tree.

80
00:17:03,549 --> 00:17:07,690
It's roots even will get strengthened from your tombstone.

81
00:17:09,659 --> 00:17:13,706
Olissia, cut off those poisonous roots from your mind.

82
00:17:14,373 --> 00:17:18,482
Such Unni hasn't ever born, nor died.

83
00:17:18,756 --> 00:17:20,756
He has no place in this world.

84
00:17:21,349 --> 00:17:22,483
Nor in your mind.

85
00:17:22,607 --> 00:17:25,490
Stop it. No. No.

86
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:28,169
Please doctor. 
hey...

87
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:32,450
She's as if she's dead.

88
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,849
No use of being alive. 
Doctor...

89
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:39,177
In the time of playful age, she became a loving mother.

90
00:17:39,435 --> 00:17:42,115
So, old-age creeped in to her youth.

91
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,786
What I was telling, she can't be a mother.

92
00:17:58,391 --> 00:17:59,891
Maybe, if she becomes a mother

93
00:18:00,542 --> 00:18:05,385
there won't be any love in her for that child. 
- Please doctor.

94
00:18:05,745 --> 00:18:08,698
- For, her mind is already dead. 
- Don't say like that

95
00:18:33,584 --> 00:18:34,083
Tell.

96
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:38,170
To hack, right?

97
00:18:42,053 --> 00:18:44,747
Will make it empty, no matter what international account.

98
00:18:46,037 --> 00:18:48,693
My commission is 30 percentage.

99
00:20:43,157 --> 00:20:43,773
Who are you?

100
00:20:45,454 --> 00:20:46,773
Grandson of Francis.

101
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:52,660
Suddenly, I couln't recognise you, Philix.

102
00:20:52,813 --> 00:20:54,146
You're all grown-up.

103
00:20:56,352 --> 00:20:57,633
Your father and mother?

104
00:20:57,961 --> 00:20:59,664
They came back with me from France.

105
00:21:00,219 --> 00:21:02,187
- Olissia? 
-Yea, come in son.

106
00:21:11,008 --> 00:21:12,008
Hi Olissia.

107
00:21:12,758 --> 00:21:15,892
You still does that great piano playing, right?

108
00:21:18,883 --> 00:21:20,531
Everything has changed here completely.

109
00:21:24,649 --> 00:21:26,906
Eight years of France life together,

110
00:21:27,946 --> 00:21:29,479
she also bored of me.

111
00:21:30,524 --> 00:21:33,008
I am also like you. Alone.

112
00:21:36,289 --> 00:21:38,211
Who told you, you're alone?

113
00:21:40,297 --> 00:21:44,219
In this lonely journey, there's only one thing to remember i.e. our childhood.

114
00:21:45,243 --> 00:21:49,883
In fact, we both are in the same life-streaming, right Olissia?

115
00:21:53,862 --> 00:21:57,745
Maybe, that's what God likes.

116
00:22:03,847 --> 00:22:05,135
- Ah! Look, he's here!

117
00:22:07,214 --> 00:22:09,393
- Olissia? 
- Olissia has a guest today.

118
00:22:09,987 --> 00:22:11,729
Phelix. An old friend.

119
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:14,050
Come dear.

120
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:18,966
Can't it be changed one day, Olissia?

121
00:22:27,396 --> 00:22:29,927
- Danny uncle has told. Phelix, right? 
-Yes.

122
00:22:30,021 --> 00:22:32,294
- You were buddy friends, right?

123
00:22:32,498 --> 00:22:36,622
- Anyways, Olissia didn't ever tell of this great friend of hers. 
- Oh

124
00:22:43,097 --> 00:22:44,651
The rest of the talk can be, having this.

125
00:22:45,409 --> 00:22:49,003
So, there's no change even in Jessica's presence.

126
00:22:58,170 --> 00:23:01,844
I've been waiting, 
still knowing, won't be come back.

127
00:23:03,868 --> 00:23:05,828
That's gone away from my love

128
00:23:06,607 --> 00:23:10,927
I've been waiting for something.

129
00:24:01,961 --> 00:24:08,666
Weaving a thousand dreams in mind

130
00:24:08,706 --> 00:24:17,331
You're near dangling in a disappearing gentle wind

131
00:24:17,355 --> 00:24:23,578
In returning memory's moonlight

132
00:24:23,641 --> 00:24:31,966
Will a memory's shadow fill me as a breeze

133
00:24:32,053 --> 00:24:43,773
Weaving a thousand dreams in mind

134
00:25:05,467 --> 00:25:14,615
In weeping nights, your deparated memories

135
00:25:14,951 --> 00:25:19,950
Whom you came searching?

136
00:25:20,037 --> 00:25:25,005
being dear memories

137
00:25:25,068 --> 00:25:29,693
will you embrace me with your dear hands?

138
00:25:29,803 --> 00:25:34,693
Will you be onto my chest for a lullaby?

139
00:25:34,826 --> 00:25:45,505
will you embrace me with your dear hands? 
Will you be onto my chest for a lullaby?

140
00:25:45,584 --> 00:25:55,255
Will you blossom as love on the Malar petals?

141
00:25:55,404 --> 00:26:04,880
Will you be a moonlight for the sight?

142
00:26:45,935 --> 00:26:50,966
In the memories you shared

143
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:55,740
The pain is being cured.

144
00:26:56,021 --> 00:27:05,294
The expected fondness by you 
in separated night

145
00:27:05,692 --> 00:27:11,035
May I come along with you in the cradle of time?

146
00:27:11,131 --> 00:27:15,763
May you be mine healing heart's ache? 
May I come along with you in the cradle of time?

147
00:27:15,912 --> 00:27:26,740
May I come along with you in the cradle of time?

148
00:27:26,943 --> 00:27:36,240
Will you be flowers on to the unlit heart?

149
00:27:37,084 --> 00:27:45,630
Will you rest on my chest healing the weeps of my mind?

150
00:27:46,888 --> 00:28:01,638
Weaving a thousand dreams in mind 
You're near dangling in a disappearing gentle wind

151
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:16,604
In returning memory's moonlight, 
Will a memory's shadow fill me as a breeze

152
00:28:17,409 --> 00:28:29,159
Weaving a thousand dreams in mind

153
00:29:16,401 --> 00:29:17,247
No Phelix

154
00:29:17,271 --> 00:29:18,271
Not like that.

155
00:29:20,013 --> 00:29:22,935
Olissia's birthday is today.

156
00:29:23,701 --> 00:29:25,974
Me and Danny uncle are celebrating.

157
00:29:30,029 --> 00:29:32,263
Anyhow, this world is not like what I've known.

158
00:29:37,422 --> 00:29:43,219
Parent. Hmm. 
My parents, they came back from France, only to get rid of me.

159
00:29:44,691 --> 00:29:50,167
Grand Father was the only console in my loney life from the childhood.

160
00:29:52,925 --> 00:29:57,167
I realised the value of that great love when I lost it.

161
00:29:59,838 --> 00:30:02,198
Whatever we've seen once may not be seen again.

162
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:04,353
May not be found out as well.

163
00:30:04,826 --> 00:30:08,607
Wth us will be something that we've never seen.

164
00:30:08,818 --> 00:30:11,005
In all my uncelebrated happiness,

165
00:30:11,428 --> 00:30:13,552
The absence of dear ones,

166
00:30:13,935 --> 00:30:16,536
What stood as a consolation was memories.

167
00:30:18,146 --> 00:30:21,161
For Olissa, at least Jessica is there.

168
00:30:22,138 --> 00:30:24,544
The world is not that hopeless, Philix.

169
00:30:24,756 --> 00:30:28,802
There's a world of hope, and love in waiting Philix.

170
00:30:29,615 --> 00:30:32,786
Everything will be fulfilled if we pray to Holy Mary.

171
00:30:33,170 --> 00:30:36,700
The lost happiness and the separated love, everything will be.

172
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,060
I too will pray for Philix.

173
00:30:40,576 --> 00:30:43,474
Please Philix, let's pray and leave.

174
00:30:47,743 --> 00:30:49,148
Please come Philix.

175
00:31:48,036 --> 00:31:52,927
The rhythm of quivering heart

176
00:31:53,357 --> 00:31:58,044
In the departed memories

177
00:31:58,506 --> 00:32:03,240
Scattering rose pot

178
00:32:06,584 --> 00:32:11,794
Became alone in darkness

179
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:16,372
Being tears alone

180
00:32:17,153 --> 00:32:22,271
Became alone in darkness

181
00:32:22,427 --> 00:32:27,270
Being tears alone

182
00:32:27,763 --> 00:32:38,216
On the shoulders of a little dream, 
Will you please rest?

183
00:32:54,092 --> 00:32:55,302
- Hi Ashlin 
- Dear Ashlin

184
00:32:55,709 --> 00:32:56,709
Smile dear.

185
00:32:59,235 --> 00:33:00,235
Hey, honey.

186
00:33:01,071 --> 00:33:02,071
Shall we go?

187
00:33:03,789 --> 00:33:04,789
Take care dear.

188
00:33:15,855 --> 00:33:17,455
Sister is really tired.

189
00:33:17,589 --> 00:33:20,221
Shall we play piano?

190
00:33:23,675 --> 00:33:27,018
Is it just enough playing along with Ashlin?

191
00:33:28,698 --> 00:33:30,745
- What about your home work? 
- Mom

192
00:33:30,987 --> 00:33:35,807
Just one more round with Ashlin, then I'll do the home work. 
Please? Please mom?

193
00:33:35,909 --> 00:33:37,245
- Hmm? 
- one more round?

194
00:33:39,331 --> 00:33:43,315
If not his sister, who'll play with Ashlyn?

195
00:33:44,969 --> 00:33:47,297
Son. Honey.

196
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,372
Need to return to Berlin vey soon.

197
00:34:25,278 --> 00:34:25,974
Ash?

198
00:34:26,162 --> 00:34:27,458
We can't take him.

199
00:34:28,217 --> 00:34:31,302
For, you're not just mother and wife there.

200
00:34:32,498 --> 00:34:35,466
But, my business partner and also my secretary.

201
00:34:41,209 --> 00:34:43,521
We could take Olissia for one year.

202
00:34:43,849 --> 00:34:47,185
Then, the situation was different. But, now...

203
00:34:47,615 --> 00:34:50,333
Olissia and Danny are there to take care of him.

204
00:34:51,052 --> 00:34:53,255
We can appoint a lady servant as well if it is necessary.

205
00:35:01,045 --> 00:35:03,138
It is not that we don't love her...

206
00:35:10,532 --> 00:35:11,532
Sherly,

207
00:35:15,516 --> 00:35:18,305
It's because we've more love and care

208
00:35:18,875 --> 00:35:21,453
Olissia stayed with us only one year.

209
00:35:23,289 --> 00:35:29,195
But, I've earned the Dollars by which 
she can live like a princess even a thousand years.

210
00:35:30,102 --> 00:35:32,672
Now, our earnings for Ashlyn.

211
00:35:34,414 --> 00:35:39,773
Today, even if we leave him as an orphan, 
He won't be as such, one day.

212
00:35:43,304 --> 00:35:46,757
And, by all means, he'll speak of us proudly...

213
00:36:13,607 --> 00:36:15,904
Ticket is confirmed and we'll go on 25th.

214
00:36:54,685 --> 00:37:00,732
(Church bell chimes)

215
00:37:20,956 --> 00:37:24,081
I proclaim it aloud:

216
00:37:24,526 --> 00:37:28,768
"By the thrown away coins, and the burning candles

217
00:37:29,425 --> 00:37:33,659
whoever comes to buy God by weighing. 
Woe to you!

218
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:38,901
The laughs of the voiceless are sobs of their sorrows.

219
00:37:39,258 --> 00:37:40,961
Let them hear who have ears."

220
00:37:41,618 --> 00:37:44,359
I tell standing on the stairs of constant sorrow

221
00:37:45,555 --> 00:37:47,891
The trees of goodness have withered away.

222
00:37:48,094 --> 00:37:50,437
The nests on the branches have fallen down.

223
00:37:52,172 --> 00:37:56,117
Still, the divine doves will nestle in that bleak darkness.

224
00:38:24,263 --> 00:38:25,536
- Olissia 
- Hmm?

225
00:38:26,818 --> 00:38:31,279
At least, you're coming to this deserted church.

226
00:38:31,865 --> 00:38:35,443
Don't waste your sadness. 
Learn to enjoy it.

227
00:38:35,810 --> 00:38:38,669
The heavenly Father who has accounts even of your hairs

228
00:38:38,935 --> 00:38:40,972
may bless you so abundantly.

229
00:39:45,628 --> 00:39:46,628
Okay, daddy.

230
00:39:56,691 --> 00:39:57,691
Olissia

231
00:40:01,401 --> 00:40:03,401
Take care of Ashlyn very well.

232
00:40:06,214 --> 00:40:08,112
- Mom will call you by reaching there. hmm? 
- Bye dear.

233
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:10,407
- Don't be sad, hmm?

234
00:40:17,107 --> 00:40:18,107
Bye, Danny uncle.

235
00:40:33,524 --> 00:40:35,906
Oh son, don't cry dear.

236
00:40:36,047 --> 00:40:38,094
Why do you cry? 
They'll come now.

237
00:40:38,219 --> 00:40:39,219
Don't cry dear.

238
00:41:21,032 --> 00:41:23,336
- Is this your little brother? 
- hmm

239
00:41:24,602 --> 00:41:27,695
When he's able to speak, what he'll call you?

240
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:32,000
Kunjechy (little sister)

241
00:41:32,055 --> 00:41:33,906
No. 
But, mother.

242
00:41:34,805 --> 00:41:37,187
Mother. 
Unny's alone mother.

243
00:42:07,886 --> 00:42:09,198
Where were you all this time?

244
00:42:09,886 --> 00:42:11,503
I was at church.

245
00:42:11,784 --> 00:42:15,424
I've told you several times not to go that Kari Kurissu Church.

246
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:16,620
And, still you go there, hmm?

247
00:42:18,542 --> 00:42:20,237
I'll inform your daddy today itself.

248
00:42:21,691 --> 00:42:25,081
Even you took that small child to him.

249
00:42:25,735 --> 00:42:27,820
- Olissia 
- hmm?

250
00:42:28,047 --> 00:42:30,851
The prayers of that old man is not holy.

251
00:42:31,805 --> 00:42:33,005
It's black magic.

252
00:42:34,274 --> 00:42:36,680
He thinks of destruction.

253
00:42:37,829 --> 00:42:38,895
Not of goodness.

254
00:42:40,175 --> 00:42:43,596
- Please uncle. Please. 
- Hmm

255
00:42:44,128 --> 00:42:47,190
- Uncle, please forgive for this time. 
- Shut up.

256
00:42:49,667 --> 00:42:53,409
Your tongue, I'll... 
Hmm go. Go, go.

257
00:44:27,066 --> 00:44:28,846
At least do have this soup.

258
00:44:30,980 --> 00:44:32,948
- Didn't you hear me? 
- No.

259
00:44:33,159 --> 00:44:36,681
How do you hear? 
You're always in front of this.

260
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:41,845
No food. No rest.

261
00:44:43,775 --> 00:44:47,507
Shh... Don't make noise. 
He'll wake up.

262
00:44:57,136 --> 00:45:00,681
- I'm composing a song. Do you know why? 
- Mm-mm?

263
00:45:01,188 --> 00:45:05,055
- This uncle doesn't know anything. There are only three days left. 
- What for?

264
00:45:05,391 --> 00:45:06,953
For my Ash's birthday.

265
00:45:11,076 --> 00:45:13,607
Daddy and Mummy will reach, 
and then us too.

266
00:45:13,787 --> 00:45:16,568
Like a prince, I'l dress my Unni.l

267
00:45:19,357 --> 00:45:23,543
- Then, here it is a great celebration! 
- Ha ha

268
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:11,177
In the moonlight

269
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:15,333
Aren't you there as a rose?

270
00:46:16,006 --> 00:46:23,083
Aren't you there in the serene skies of twinkling stars?

271
00:46:23,615 --> 00:46:26,130
Blossomed in moonlight,

272
00:46:26,138 --> 00:46:28,372
Shedding honey

273
00:46:28,435 --> 00:46:31,529
Come dancing near mother.

274
00:46:31,865 --> 00:46:39,435
Shall share you the love of a throbbing heart. 
Unni come near me.

275
00:46:39,865 --> 00:46:47,466
Aren't you there as a rose in the moonlight?

276
00:46:48,037 --> 00:46:55,247
Aren't you there in the serene skies of twinkling stars?

277
00:47:28,443 --> 00:47:36,398
Smiling Unnikanna showing cheeks

278
00:47:36,469 --> 00:47:40,250
To the flowering tender lips

279
00:47:40,414 --> 00:47:43,961
shall breast-feed you

280
00:47:44,008 --> 00:47:47,820
Singing in fondle and dancing in swing

281
00:47:47,851 --> 00:47:51,336
Aren't you the smiling child?

282
00:47:51,914 --> 00:47:59,250
Singing in fondle and dancing in swing 
Aren't you the smiling child?

283
00:47:59,305 --> 00:48:03,820
Aren't you the sweet darling?

284
00:48:03,829 --> 00:48:07,351
Aren't you the Kingini dear?

285
00:48:07,493 --> 00:48:10,961
Don't you cry little darling

286
00:48:11,329 --> 00:48:15,641
Am I not there as a Thumba Flower

287
00:48:16,063 --> 00:48:24,062
Aren't you there in the serene skies of twinkling stars?

288
00:48:46,839 --> 00:48:48,706
(Trying to imitate sounds)

289
00:48:52,224 --> 00:48:53,224
Did you learn honey?

290
00:48:54,279 --> 00:49:03,883
(Trying to teach him music notes)

291
00:49:04,336 --> 00:49:05,336
Did you learn?

292
00:49:07,079 --> 00:49:08,279
Please tell honey.

293
00:49:09,954 --> 00:49:10,828
- Ash 
- Huh

294
00:49:10,860 --> 00:49:11,860
Tell

295
00:49:13,542 --> 00:49:14,542
Let Mom tell?

296
00:49:25,646 --> 00:49:29,372
- Upset? 
- No 
- What it would have been, if I didn't teach you this?

297
00:49:37,769 --> 00:49:39,432
Come. Come. Come.

298
00:50:12,049 --> 00:50:13,167
Smile dear.

299
00:50:14,401 --> 00:50:16,760

300
00:50:20,456 --> 00:50:22,573
Kisses

301
00:50:30,036 --> 00:50:31,872
- Please hold this. 
- Oh yes.

302
00:50:33,474 --> 00:50:34,763
(Phone ringing)

303
00:50:35,678 --> 00:50:36,678
Olissia

304
00:50:38,404 --> 00:50:39,471
I'm sorry dear.

305
00:50:39,935 --> 00:50:42,161
I can't come for the birthday, dear.

306
00:50:44,417 --> 00:50:46,745
Mom shall call you sweety.

307
00:50:47,581 --> 00:50:49,174
- Mom 
- Hello?

308
00:50:49,495 --> 00:50:51,159
Olissia? Hello?

309
00:50:52,526 --> 00:50:54,213
Common, walk son.

310
00:50:54,354 --> 00:50:56,721
Please look here. 
Please smile at this Grand-father.

311
00:50:57,292 --> 00:50:59,159
Smart boy. Smart boy.

312
00:51:06,032 --> 00:51:08,226
- What happened? 
- Daddy and Mummy won't come.

313
00:51:59,454 --> 00:52:02,003
My Unni, mine alone.

314
00:52:24,995 --> 00:52:28,128
- Olissia 
- Hmm?

315
00:52:28,816 --> 00:52:32,316
When Ashlyn grew up, daddy will take you both to Germany.

316
00:52:32,371 --> 00:52:35,948
When all you come together, it'll be very happy everyday. 
Let it go of today.

317
00:52:37,797 --> 00:52:40,172
Hope, my grand-father won't kill me before that.

318
00:52:44,282 --> 00:52:47,328
Olissia, daddy has just called you.

319
00:52:49,110 --> 00:52:52,414
Told, don't reduce celebrations as they don't come.

320
00:52:54,010 --> 00:52:55,760
Come, let's have dinner.

321
00:52:57,620 --> 00:52:58,954
I am not hungry now.

322
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:03,042
- You are also not hungry? 
- No.

323
00:53:03,441 --> 00:53:04,878
Go and have dinner.

324
00:53:10,487 --> 00:53:12,315
(Sighs)

325
00:53:40,214 --> 00:53:43,932
Anyways, the birthday party was really grant.

326
00:53:44,355 --> 00:53:45,651
Nice food.

327
00:53:45,933 --> 00:53:51,698
- Being glutton, you'll make me to run to the doctor tonight. 
- Shut up

328
00:53:52,487 --> 00:53:56,549
I've parceled some food for the night.

329
00:53:56,956 --> 00:54:00,956
From that, you don't expect not even a little.

330
00:54:01,019 --> 00:54:02,174
I don't need it.

331
00:54:02,448 --> 00:54:04,198
Perfect day to parcel it.

332
00:54:04,581 --> 00:54:08,721
- They are all tensed since Daddy didn't come. 
- Ha ha

333
00:54:09,487 --> 00:54:10,487
Fools!

334
00:54:11,737 --> 00:54:14,604
Whoever has gone from here, didn't come back.

335
00:54:15,620 --> 00:54:19,807
With the sacks of money, they'll come once.

336
00:54:20,737 --> 00:54:28,234
But, then, the journey will be in like-this wheelchairs and mobile ICUs .

337
00:54:29,032 --> 00:54:31,859
Ha ha ha 
Ha ha ha

338
00:54:40,852 --> 00:54:43,185
Ashlyin dear. 
My little darling.

339
00:54:43,563 --> 00:54:44,563
Honey.

340
00:55:33,901 --> 00:55:37,698
Ah, give him. 
Come here.

341
00:55:38,316 --> 00:55:42,284
- Till I come back from the school, you should take care of him very well. 
- Yes, your Majesty (Mocking)

342
00:55:43,151 --> 00:55:44,909
- Why so sarcastic!? 
- No.

343
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:46,979
Give food on time.

344
00:55:47,058 --> 00:55:49,995
Don't keep on speaking with everyone passes by.

345
00:55:50,183 --> 00:55:52,956
- Shall I go then? 
The rest I'll tell you. 
- Hmm

346
00:55:53,284 --> 00:55:55,712
Well, everything you said is great!

347
00:55:56,087 --> 00:55:57,765
Go and study something.

348
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:01,663
Else, you would sit here forever taking care of this child.

349
00:56:01,859 --> 00:56:03,859
- Then, I'll love it. 
- Hmm

350
00:56:10,758 --> 00:56:11,828
- Dear 
- Hmm

351
00:56:11,961 --> 00:56:14,507
Come. Kisses.

352
00:56:14,555 --> 00:56:16,101
Give me a kiss.

353
00:56:22,761 --> 00:56:23,761
Bye.

354
00:57:03,685 --> 00:57:05,599
What happened Olissia? Gone mad?

355
00:57:06,076 --> 00:57:07,763
Why couldn't you come back in that school bus?

356
00:57:08,693 --> 00:57:10,794
It's been a while your hurryness.

357
00:57:13,420 --> 00:57:16,396
- Hope no problem for Ashlyn. 
- A lot of problems;

358
00:57:16,803 --> 00:57:18,365
Not for Ashlyn, but for you.

359
00:57:24,967 --> 00:57:25,967
Honey

360
00:57:39,029 --> 00:57:40,029
Unni dear

361
00:57:40,521 --> 00:57:43,630
If you put on weight, it'll be tough for me.

362
00:57:44,529 --> 00:57:47,388
Don't burst those balloons sitting on my shoulders.

363
00:57:48,060 --> 00:57:49,927
- Will you burst it? 
- No.

364
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:52,911
It is to hang on our Christmas tree.

365
00:57:53,092 --> 00:57:58,083
This whole world will celebrate Unni's Birthday. 
Do you know why?

366
00:58:00,263 --> 00:58:01,263
You little idiot.

367
00:58:01,553 --> 00:58:04,927
The birthday of you and Jesus is on the same day.

368
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:11,930
Do you know, who are coming to celebrate this year's Christmas and Unni's birthday?

369
00:58:12,235 --> 00:58:13,235
Dad and mom.

370
00:58:13,899 --> 00:58:17,742
Then, we go to Germany along with dad and mom.

371
00:58:18,016 --> 00:58:18,789
Did you hear?

372
00:58:22,938 --> 00:58:23,938
Come.

373
00:58:28,563 --> 00:58:29,563
There it is.

374
00:58:49,555 --> 00:58:51,273
- Is there Pappa with you? 
- He is, definitely.

375
00:58:54,321 --> 00:58:57,430
(Speaking in Hindi language)

376
00:58:59,391 --> 00:59:01,101
Come. Come. 
Sherly, please.

377
00:59:02,258 --> 00:59:03,883
- Hi Ashlyn 
- Dear.

378
00:59:04,102 --> 00:59:05,914
- Hello 
- Every one is on the other side.

379
00:59:14,925 --> 00:59:15,925
Come dear.

380
00:59:22,344 --> 00:59:23,544
Didn't Appu come?

381
01:00:50,016 --> 01:00:51,851
Do dance well, you all.

382
01:01:19,026 --> 01:01:21,307
- Grandpa, control your food. 
- Get lost.

383
01:03:53,946 --> 01:03:54,946
My Unni.

384
01:03:57,558 --> 01:04:01,409
- Mother... 
- Huh 
- What happened!?

385
01:04:01,599 --> 01:04:07,867
(Inaudible conversations)

386
01:04:24,969 --> 01:04:25,969
Son...

387
01:04:27,625 --> 01:04:28,625
Ashlyn

388
01:04:32,079 --> 01:04:33,531
Dear... Olissia. 
Olissia.

389
01:04:33,586 --> 01:04:35,195
Dear... Dear...

390
01:04:43,644 --> 01:04:44,644
Dear

391
01:04:46,128 --> 01:04:47,128
Olissia

392
01:04:49,191 --> 01:04:50,657
Open your eyes, dear.

393
01:04:52,365 --> 01:05:02,083
Only for you, 
blooming in my memory

394
01:05:02,920 --> 01:05:10,325
Trembles mind's pain

395
01:05:11,537 --> 01:05:16,521
You're alone in my dreams.

396
01:05:16,748 --> 01:05:20,747
In reality, I'm alone.

397
01:05:22,287 --> 01:05:32,052
On the shoulders of a little dream, 
Will you please rest?

398
01:05:32,739 --> 01:05:43,896
On the body of a little star, 
I will sing lullaby.

399
01:06:27,588 --> 01:06:29,831
John, please take at least these medicines.

400
01:06:31,261 --> 01:06:32,409
I don't want.

401
01:06:33,370 --> 01:06:34,667
Why uncle like this?

402
01:06:34,987 --> 01:06:35,987
Take that medicine.

403
01:06:37,120 --> 01:06:39,112
- What for? 
- To get well.

404
01:06:44,284 --> 01:06:46,432
Then? 
Then, for what?

405
01:06:48,784 --> 01:06:51,362
I don't need this to postpone death.

406
01:06:51,456 --> 01:06:52,588
Don't say like that.

407
01:06:53,847 --> 01:06:56,526
When we gain one thing, lose another.

408
01:06:57,480 --> 01:06:58,698
Take as such.

409
01:06:59,683 --> 01:07:01,432
Earned a lot.

410
01:07:02,011 --> 01:07:03,917
But, what's the point.

411
01:07:04,347 --> 01:07:06,799
Life is like a mirror.

412
01:07:07,566 --> 01:07:09,831
Many things will appear and disappear.

413
01:07:10,386 --> 01:07:12,510
But, nothing will be there as constant.

414
01:07:14,667 --> 01:07:18,713
We came here giving Unni to Olissia when he was 6 month old.

415
01:07:19,732 --> 01:07:21,841
She was sister to him,

416
01:07:22,357 --> 01:07:25,482
mother to him 
And everything to him.

417
01:07:28,083 --> 01:07:32,778
When we came for Unni's third birthday, what we gifted her...

418
01:07:34,748 --> 01:07:36,982
Unni's dead- body.

419
01:07:38,771 --> 01:07:42,435
Olissia hates even to see us.

420
01:07:42,967 --> 01:07:47,021
Robert, you should go to India for us.

421
01:07:47,342 --> 01:07:49,247
And fr our daughter.

422
01:07:49,631 --> 01:07:52,825
You can, to give back my old Olissia.

423
01:07:56,534 --> 01:08:04,448
Losing existence, when I die here in Germany, 
At least to give a kiss, Olissia should be here among us.

424
01:08:31,253 --> 01:08:34,229
- Why haven't you attended the calls for the past few days? 
- Nothing.

425
01:08:35,050 --> 01:08:39,409
-Robert will come there. 
- Why? 
- He comes there for a geological.thesis ..

426
01:08:39,964 --> 01:08:41,948
We should provide accomodation in our home.

427
01:08:42,263 --> 01:08:45,107
Why can't you arrange it somewhere else?

428
01:08:45,529 --> 01:08:48,083
Dear, Robert is a very important person to us.

429
01:08:48,365 --> 01:08:50,982
There's no one important to me.

430
01:08:51,717 --> 01:08:53,677
I don't like, he's coming here.

431
01:09:22,172 --> 01:09:24,906
(Phone ringing)

432
01:09:53,329 --> 01:09:54,329
Ah, come. Come.

433
01:10:01,180 --> 01:10:02,703
- This is your room, Robert. 
- Mm-hmm

434
01:10:02,774 --> 01:10:03,774
- Freshen up 
- Okay.

435
01:10:04,399 --> 01:10:05,399
- I'll get you tea. 
- Okay uncle.

436
01:10:08,441 --> 01:10:10,974
(Sounds of waves from the backwaters)

437
01:10:23,573 --> 01:10:24,707
What do you want?

438
01:10:27,995 --> 01:10:30,518
Don't ask anyone, what do they want?

439
01:10:30,730 --> 01:10:33,878
Huh, what if I asked for the moon..? 
How will I explain...

440
01:10:38,571 --> 01:10:40,156
Hmm, have this tea.

441
01:10:51,164 --> 01:10:53,633
Don't find comfort in keep disturbing him.

442
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:57,156
I brought this tea for Olissia. Please.

443
01:10:59,329 --> 01:11:00,329
Hmm

444
01:11:06,008 --> 01:11:08,016
Did aunty speak of me?

445
01:11:11,727 --> 01:11:13,555
Aunty not, Mother.

446
01:11:18,899 --> 01:11:22,539
Daddy and mummy, they were waiting to see Olissia.

447
01:11:23,079 --> 01:11:25,383
When are you going to Germany, Olissia?

448
01:11:28,110 --> 01:11:29,110
I don't know.

449
01:11:30,180 --> 01:11:33,023
- When will your reach complete? 
- I too don't kno.

450
01:11:35,899 --> 01:11:38,359
I know, this room is Olissia's world.

451
01:11:38,805 --> 01:11:41,367
If you're fine pleoday.ase join us for the prayer today.

452
01:11:42,016 --> 01:11:45,719
God does like so much the communion of love.

453
01:11:47,219 --> 01:11:51,055
Our prayer is not for us; 
but for those who separate from us.

454
01:12:05,086 --> 01:12:07,758
Once he'will come from the heavens.

455
01:12:08,164 --> 01:12:09,164
To see us all.

456
01:12:33,524 --> 01:12:38,726
(Whispering prayers)

457
01:13:24,938 --> 01:13:26,405
Became a little late.

458
01:13:33,118 --> 01:13:34,118
- Did Jessica know? 
- Hmm?

459
01:13:35,219 --> 01:13:37,562
A local guardian has come for Olissia from Germany.

460
01:13:40,016 --> 01:13:41,320
You got tensed?

461
01:13:42,024 --> 01:13:44,812
Never. She's just a friend.

462
01:13:45,102 --> 01:13:47,773
There's only one person in my mind.

463
01:14:11,987 --> 01:14:14,885
- Are you more frequent to it? 
- No, just occassionally.

464
01:14:15,769 --> 01:14:18,456
Without these, we too will become like Olissia

465
01:14:26,680 --> 01:14:27,680
It's good.

466
01:14:27,922 --> 01:14:32,008
Occassionally, a comfort to our body and for mind as well.

467
01:14:47,370 --> 01:14:49,157
When will you go to France?

468
01:14:49,705 --> 01:14:52,978
You'll be with me when I'll go.

469
01:14:54,556 --> 01:14:58,454
Do I have to live for Daddy and mummy, who have come here just to get rid of me.

470
01:14:59,080 --> 01:15:01,579
Or, do I have to live for you?

471
01:15:32,120 --> 01:15:36,901
(Singing in non-malayalm language)

472
01:15:45,112 --> 01:15:49,534
We'll search for love and run for desires.

473
01:15:49,573 --> 01:15:52,948
This game of life is in speed

474
01:15:53,354 --> 01:15:58,080
We'll change for times and search for roles.

475
01:15:58,144 --> 01:16:01,557
This game of life is in speed.

476
01:16:02,263 --> 01:16:04,833
(Singing in non-malayalm language)

477
01:17:02,042 --> 01:17:05,909
In the smiles of day

478
01:17:05,925 --> 01:17:09,878
Weakening mind

479
01:17:10,565 --> 01:17:14,464
In the covering of night

480
01:17:14,901 --> 01:17:19,221
crying simply

481
01:18:04,185 --> 01:18:07,279
We'll search for love.

482
01:18:54,214 --> 01:18:58,104
We'll search for love and run for desires.

483
01:18:58,128 --> 01:19:01,651
This game of life is in speed.

484
01:19:02,206 --> 01:19:06,674
We'll change for times and search for roles.

485
01:19:06,722 --> 01:19:10,128
This game of life is in speed.

486
01:19:36,675 --> 01:19:44,682
We'll change for times and search for roles. 
 This game of life is in speed.

487
01:19:57,909 --> 01:19:59,253
I'll give it today.

488
01:20:06,432 --> 01:20:09,065
Olissia 
Olissia

489
01:20:13,766 --> 01:20:15,476
Olissia, food is ready.

490
01:20:18,133 --> 01:20:21,359
If all withdrew to each rooms,

491
01:20:21,618 --> 01:20:24,250
this home will end up as of the heartless.

492
01:20:25,258 --> 01:20:30,070
Your Unni is living in every one's heart as a Rose.

493
01:21:20,711 --> 01:21:21,711
Not having?

494
01:23:27,904 --> 01:23:29,802
Unni will be seeing us.

495
01:23:30,748 --> 01:23:32,357
Instead of our bouquet

496
01:23:33,060 --> 01:23:37,279
a thousand bouquet that he gives back; Olissia is not seeing it.

497
01:23:38,599 --> 01:23:40,279
Can't you see it, Olissia?

498
01:23:48,138 --> 01:23:49,138
I can.

499
01:23:51,209 --> 01:23:54,560
Let's us go receiving it in our hearts.

500
01:23:55,138 --> 01:23:56,138
Come.

501
01:24:08,248 --> 01:24:11,888
Every one hates the blessings by these weak hands.

502
01:24:12,209 --> 01:24:15,794
Yet, if anything is left in me let it be for you.

503
01:24:18,654 --> 01:24:20,279
I tell in sadness,

504
01:24:20,568 --> 01:24:25,082
If you're still hunt by Unni's death, 
your fate will be for being a prey to it.

505
01:24:26,715 --> 01:24:30,457
I saved only these candles to light it when I die.

506
01:24:30,792 --> 01:24:35,369
So, none likes me to die. 
 I'll die in suffering.

507
01:24:35,740 --> 01:24:39,372
Ha ha ha

508
01:25:07,717 --> 01:25:10,661
I really didn't like hat that father told.

509
01:25:11,224 --> 01:25:14,130
These friendships made you like this.

510
01:25:16,474 --> 01:25:20,747
From her childhood, I advise her, not to meet him.

511
01:25:22,131 --> 01:25:24,943
But, Olissia needs only his prayers.

512
01:25:27,076 --> 01:25:29,021
Father tells only truth.

513
01:25:29,756 --> 01:25:31,927
I believe it.

514
01:25:32,357 --> 01:25:34,193
Who did wish Unni to die?

515
01:25:34,693 --> 01:25:37,372
Did you? 
And, did your Danny uncle?

516
01:25:37,654 --> 01:25:38,880
Without the peace of mind,

517
01:25:39,115 --> 01:25:39,794
In germany,

518
01:25:39,873 --> 01:25:41,466
living in just expecting you

519
01:25:41,717 --> 01:25:43,372
your dad and mom wished for it?

520
01:26:22,941 --> 01:26:24,081
How is it Philix?

521
01:26:27,058 --> 01:26:28,058
Nothing yet.

522
01:26:29,761 --> 01:26:31,760
Everything will be fine in two days.

523
01:26:33,987 --> 01:26:36,346
It's foolish to be late.

524
01:26:37,862 --> 01:26:43,979
It shouldn't ever happen to a hacker, okay?

525
01:26:51,933 --> 01:26:57,159
Going to have crores 
and much prosperity.

526
01:27:00,128 --> 01:27:04,737
I need to operate it with someone else if not Philix.

527
01:27:11,323 --> 01:27:16,206
- Our target is not such documents that we can ask directly. 
- Hmm, no.

528
01:27:17,284 --> 01:27:21,518
It's possible to cheat only once and it takes time.

529
01:28:15,396 --> 01:28:19,638
On the disappearing paths, paths...

530
01:28:19,646 --> 01:28:23,716
Blooming memories, memories...

531
01:28:23,770 --> 01:28:27,872
Shall share my pain, pain

532
01:28:27,935 --> 01:28:31,435
Shower your love

533
01:28:31,513 --> 01:28:35,607
Separated unknowingly, 
Filled in dreams,

534
01:28:35,654 --> 01:28:40,240
Shed petals without blossoming

535
01:28:40,310 --> 01:28:48,052
Shattered in darkness, 
Tear-filled eyes, 
Unfaded nights...

536
01:29:17,542 --> 01:29:25,221
Will time dissipate my unending sadness?

537
01:29:25,761 --> 01:29:33,573
Will it echo in the ears, the ever-needed loving chatters?

538
01:29:34,073 --> 01:29:42,338
Will you come as my childhood to listen to my story?

539
01:29:42,394 --> 01:29:50,479
Please return in my memory to listen to my voice.

540
01:30:23,704 --> 01:30:31,594
Would love fade away in this never-ending journey?

541
01:30:31,907 --> 01:30:39,797
My life disappears as the sobs of nights

542
01:30:40,250 --> 01:30:48,531
Will you come close as time to listen to the voice of separation?

543
01:30:48,594 --> 01:30:58,909
Will you come as my tomorrows to see 
my eyes that filled in dreams?

544
01:30:58,956 --> 01:31:01,635
As my tomorrows.

545
01:32:14,964 --> 01:32:18,635
- Olissia 
- Where were you all this time?

546
01:32:18,691 --> 01:32:21,091
I've been here itself, close to you.

547
01:32:28,409 --> 01:32:30,893
Freshen up. Let's go for a trip.

548
01:32:31,878 --> 01:32:32,878
Where?

549
01:32:33,503 --> 01:32:34,323
Anywhere.

550
01:32:34,480 --> 01:32:37,331
How long it's been since we spend time together.

551
01:34:00,019 --> 01:34:02,721
- What do you want? 
- Nothing.

552
01:34:03,097 --> 01:34:04,097
What is it, huh?

553
01:34:04,487 --> 01:34:05,628
- What do you really search here?

554
01:34:07,401 --> 01:34:08,870
No, searched nothing.

555
01:34:09,269 --> 01:34:12,737
Don't come this house in the name of old relationship.

556
01:34:17,534 --> 01:34:19,807
Robert, what are you telling?

557
01:34:20,214 --> 01:34:21,690
This is my Jessica.

558
01:34:23,549 --> 01:34:27,612
She's killing you by smiling. 
You can't understand it all.

559
01:35:09,206 --> 01:35:12,588
Didn't I say it? 
Your friendship made you as such.

560
01:35:12,917 --> 01:35:14,432
Don't be a fool again.

561
01:37:46,628 --> 01:37:49,971
- Hello Jessic. Hello. 
- Dear

562
01:37:50,472 --> 01:37:52,862
- Hello 
- I'm Jessica's father, dear.

563
01:37:52,971 --> 01:37:56,305
- Uncle 
- Did she tell anything to you yesterday?

564
01:37:56,620 --> 01:37:57,620
- No.

565
01:38:00,417 --> 01:38:04,378
- Didn't tell anything to me. 
- Why did she do as such, then?

566
01:38:04,612 --> 01:38:07,854
We lost her dear. 
We lost her.

567
01:38:19,208 --> 01:38:25,419
(Trying to call again) 
(Receiving switched-off message)

568
01:39:36,810 --> 01:39:42,232
Olissia, come. Today's breakfast is my special.

569
01:39:52,099 --> 01:39:58,224
You... 
You killed my Jessica. You, you alone.

570
01:40:02,006 --> 01:40:03,786
Why did you come to this room?

571
01:40:11,646 --> 01:40:14,107
Credits card, the key to the treasure box.

572
01:40:16,474 --> 01:40:17,474
What for?

573
01:40:19,545 --> 01:40:21,060
Can't you give it?

574
01:40:28,943 --> 01:40:30,200
I don't need anything.

575
01:40:38,920 --> 01:40:40,513
Every one is leaving me.

576
01:40:42,873 --> 01:40:43,873
My Unni.

577
01:40:44,982 --> 01:40:46,099
My Jessica.

578
01:40:55,756 --> 01:40:56,822
You can also go.

579
01:40:59,829 --> 01:41:05,133
Don't come this home in the name of any relation.

580
01:42:07,240 --> 01:42:11,490
The day I remember your face unknowingly

581
01:42:11,568 --> 01:42:16,279
Bloomed silence in mind.

582
01:42:24,560 --> 01:42:33,224
The day I remember your face unknowingly, 
bloomed silence in mind.

583
01:42:33,271 --> 01:42:37,638
Night memories that stood disappeared.

584
01:42:37,787 --> 01:42:41,708
will it separate now?

585
01:42:42,130 --> 01:42:50,990
To await you ever, 
To await you ever,

586
01:42:51,279 --> 01:42:59,529
You didn't utter anything. 
 You didn't utter anything.

587
01:42:59,623 --> 01:43:07,599
The day I remember your face unknowingly, 
bloomed silence in mind.

588
01:43:44,058 --> 01:43:52,596
The day I met you first time, 
I waited you alone.

589
01:43:52,800 --> 01:44:01,260
The day I met you first time, 
I waited you alone.

590
01:44:01,487 --> 01:44:06,135
To be one for at least once.

591
01:44:06,175 --> 01:44:10,221
To be one for at least once.

592
01:44:10,292 --> 01:44:16,517
Will you come with me as my companion?

593
01:44:16,753 --> 01:44:21,135
I shall wait.

594
01:44:24,675 --> 01:44:32,979
The day I remember your face unknowingly, 
bloomed silence in mind.

595
01:44:33,105 --> 01:44:41,924
The night memories that stood disappeared. 
will it separate now?

596
01:44:53,086 --> 01:44:55,586
(Utter a strong cry)

597
01:45:24,180 --> 01:45:32,953
I came alone, 
You're being love on my way.

598
01:45:33,039 --> 01:45:41,562
I came alone, 
You're being love on my way.

599
01:45:41,594 --> 01:45:46,734
To be hand-in-hand throughout this journey.

600
01:45:46,797 --> 01:45:50,516
To be hand-in-hand throughout this journey.

601
01:45:50,586 --> 01:45:56,453
Don't separate in this life.

602
01:45:57,164 --> 01:46:01,656
Don't shed...

603
01:46:05,055 --> 01:46:13,336
The day I remember your face unknowingly, 
bloomed silence in mind.

604
01:46:13,719 --> 01:46:22,437
The night memories that stood disappeared. 
will it separate now?

605
01:46:38,914 --> 01:46:44,430
(Playing piano)

606
01:46:45,750 --> 01:46:46,750
Olissia

607
01:46:50,602 --> 01:46:53,172
Will come. Can't be otherwise.

608
01:46:53,789 --> 01:46:58,672
Do you know, a baby is not just growing in mother's womb...

609
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:00,711
In a father's mind too.

610
01:47:00,899 --> 01:47:06,437
It grows as bigger hope and dreams...

611
01:47:19,102 --> 01:47:21,695
I can understand a woman.

612
01:47:22,391 --> 01:47:25,125
I can understand a mother's pain.

613
01:47:26,211 --> 01:47:29,726
The happiness when we receive and the pain when we lose it...

614
01:47:30,079 --> 01:47:32,648
There won't be anyone who knows it better than me.

615
01:47:33,532 --> 01:47:39,898
I've been living in great agony when I lost Unni and 
when I felt, I was losing my daughter too.

616
01:47:40,579 --> 01:47:43,203
But, I didn't see it outside.

617
01:47:44,008 --> 01:47:46,773
The modern world women are as such, it seems.

618
01:47:47,110 --> 01:47:49,312
I can't take it any longer.

619
01:47:49,602 --> 01:47:52,656
I am just a woman... just a mother.

620
01:48:08,401 --> 01:48:15,565
- John, Olissia is pregnant; and do you know its father? 
- Hmm

621
01:48:16,448 --> 01:48:17,448
Robert.

622
01:48:19,355 --> 01:48:22,948
Why did Robert go to germany 
 leaving my daughter alone in this conditin?

623
01:48:27,644 --> 01:48:31,026
See, he'll come. Let's call him.

624
01:48:38,378 --> 01:48:43,651
Home, it was a cemetry for me till now.

625
01:48:44,151 --> 01:48:47,417
But, now I feel very happy.

626
01:48:47,816 --> 01:48:50,292
Here also, we're going to have a baby;

627
01:48:50,855 --> 01:48:53,174
A grandchild for us.

628
01:48:55,292 --> 01:48:57,128
I didn't expect it as such.

629
01:48:58,675 --> 01:49:02,065
Nothing happened in our life as we've expected.

630
01:49:02,550 --> 01:49:04,483
Everything is God's willing.

631
01:49:05,206 --> 01:49:09,268
We need to tell everything calling Robert.

632
01:49:10,573 --> 01:49:14,315
But, Olissia... She...

633
01:49:15,870 --> 01:49:20,706
Hmm... 
I don't know, what's in her mind.

634
01:49:36,378 --> 01:49:39,003
- Dear 
- Olissia 
- Olissia

635
01:49:43,331 --> 01:49:45,385
Oh God, save my child.

636
01:53:09,092 --> 01:53:10,092
Son...

637
01:53:12,709 --> 01:53:14,591
Hi dear.

638
01:53:19,068 --> 01:53:21,638
Olissia, Robert will come now.

639
01:53:32,248 --> 01:53:33,708
Father of your child.

640
01:53:43,912 --> 01:53:45,833
I have only my Unni

641
01:53:48,170 --> 01:53:49,419
None else, I've.

642
01:54:26,990 --> 01:54:31,232
Oh, what dear. 
Son. Don't cry dear.

643
01:54:48,967 --> 01:54:51,341
Olissia, can you forget me?

644
01:54:55,388 --> 01:55:00,404
I promised your mom to bring back you to their life.

645
01:55:01,935 --> 01:55:06,591
I brought you back not to their life alone, but to my life as well.

646
01:55:08,053 --> 01:55:11,044
I'm your Robert, only your's.

647
01:55:21,763 --> 01:55:22,763
Dear

648
01:55:24,951 --> 01:55:27,200
Olissia, it is our child.

649
01:55:28,411 --> 01:55:33,575
Instead of our departed Unni, 
Another Unni to us, gifted by God.

650
01:55:51,599 --> 01:55:52,599
Olissia

651
01:55:56,060 --> 01:55:58,325
Don't we want to bring up him so dearly?

652
01:56:06,592 --> 01:56:08,992
Don't we have to sing him lullabies?

653
01:56:11,232 --> 01:56:13,888
Our Unni. 
Our Unni alone.

654
01:56:23,037 --> 01:56:26,443
Unni. Son. 
Dear.

655
01:56:30,146 --> 01:56:32,552
Don't we have to take him on shoulders?

656
01:56:44,834 --> 01:56:47,615
Don't we have to take him Kurishumala (A pilgrimage centre)

657
01:56:59,873 --> 01:57:02,529
Along with Unni, along with all

658
01:57:03,599 --> 01:57:07,466
Without any sadness, without any pain to carry

659
01:57:08,021 --> 01:57:10,794
Don't we have to celebrate a lot of Christmas?

660
01:58:06,667 --> 01:58:24,255
In this journey, you might be meeting an Ashlyn like this anywhere. 
This is a reminder: love is to express, not to save.

661
01:58:31,592 --> 01:58:42,036
On the shoulders of a little dream, 
Will you please rest?

662
01:58:42,084 --> 01:58:52,146
On the body of a little star, 
I will sing lullaby.

663
01:58:52,474 --> 01:59:02,958
On the shoulders of a little dream, 
Will you please rest?

664
01:59:03,006 --> 01:59:13,380
On the body of a little star, 
I will sing lullaby.

665
01:59:13,388 --> 01:59:23,365
You became a companion and support 
as my dream.

666
01:59:23,576 --> 01:59:33,411
On the shoulders of a little dream, 
Will you please rest?

667
01:59:33,631 --> 01:59:44,122
On the body of a little star, 
I will sing lullaby.
